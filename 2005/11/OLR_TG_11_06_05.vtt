Orange Lounge Radio To Go Edition, week of November 7th, 2005.

00:04.000 --> 00:09.000
You're tuned in to the Orange Lounge Radio To Go Edition.

00:09.000 --> 00:13.000
Your podcast calls for all the latest video game news and gamer chat.

00:13.000 --> 00:18.000
Now, here are your hosts, DarkSakura, Sky, and Loki.

00:18.000 --> 00:23.000
Hello, everybody. Once again, you're tuned in to Orange Lounge Radio To Go.

00:23.000 --> 00:27.000
It's the podcast dedicated to video games that don't suck,

00:27.000 --> 00:33.000
But sometimes we have to talk about a few games that do suck, only to tell you to stay far, far away from them.

00:33.000 --> 00:40.000
My name is Rob Roberts, you might know me as Sky. Joining me, as always, actually back from a little vacation, is Dark Sakura.

00:40.000 --> 00:44.000
Not really a vacation thing, it's how I was working my ass off during all that time.

00:44.000 --> 00:48.000
Well, okay, but a vacation from the show. Did you miss us?

00:48.000 --> 00:50.000
My aim's improving.

00:50.000 --> 00:56.000
That's what I thought you'd say. Now, ironically enough, even though you're out past two weeks, you're not going to be here next week.

00:56.000 --> 01:00.320
yeah cuz I'm gonna be at the podcast awards yes and thank you so much to our

enamored of him I have to say all right also joining us someone who's still not

01:42.840 --> 01:49.800
old enough to appreciate boys it's a Loki huh bad joke forget it what's up

01:49.800 --> 01:53.960
not much I'm in one of those moods tonight as I mentioned on the

01:53.960 --> 01:57.960
live 3 hour program that's on orange slouch radio how you doing how was your

01:57.960 --> 01:58.300
week

01:58.300 --> 02:03.240
Logie my week was good I killed lots of my boss and

02:03.240 --> 02:06.940
other people at the same time sounds good well tonight we got a fun program for you

02:06.940 --> 02:07.400
guys

02:07.400 --> 02:11.400
we got a lot of interesting news a brand new movie is being made

02:11.400 --> 02:14.760
out of a video game we're definitely going to talk about that we're going to talk about some

02:14.760 --> 02:16.660
upcoming Nintendo DS releases

02:16.660 --> 02:20.140
not just Mario Kart DS and all that stuff but looking into first quarter next year

02:20.140 --> 02:23.660
and on tonight's program we have an interview

02:23.660 --> 02:27.060
which should be very interesting we actually have a follow-up to a story we

02:27.060 --> 02:28.580
talked about a couple weeks ago

02:28.580 --> 02:31.860
gonna be a good good show so we're gonna start off tonight though

02:31.860 --> 02:34.860
as we always like to start off Orange Lounge Radio To Go by talking about

02:34.860 --> 02:38.660
our gaming week and what we've been up to so DarkSakura why don't you start us off

02:38.660 --> 02:42.060
um seeing as how school and

02:42.060 --> 02:45.940
everything has been kicking my butt I did however get Guitar Hero

02:45.940 --> 02:47.940
on Friday

02:47.980 --> 02:51.220
Been playing the crap out of it. I love that game

02:51.220 --> 02:56.540
I was actually it's more or less me playing more than I feel and on repeat because I love that song

02:56.900 --> 03:02.140
Yeah, it wasn't until I played it on your TV that I ever started missing more than one note in a row. Oh gee

03:02.140 --> 03:07.620
Sorry, well, it's kind of standing up and looking down and have this killer of a headache, but

03:08.300 --> 03:10.580
I'm sorry. It's all perspective

03:10.580 --> 03:15.300
I think I would have done better had I been sitting down but you have to sort of stand and rock out with that guitar

03:15.300 --> 03:22.620
you know and then um uh really it's been you know it's hard for me to get to my

03:22.620 --> 03:27.920
TV because Dan's been going on a Star Wars kick lately as playing the battle

03:27.920 --> 03:32.560
front 2 game no he's freaking watching episode 3 and then went back and watch

03:32.560 --> 03:39.540
the others oh that kind of powers kick I hear you know this is bad acting coming

03:39.540 --> 03:46.540
out of hating Christians, and I'm like, oh! No! So, George Lucas owes me $30.

03:46.900 --> 03:50.140
Alright. Loki, how was your gaming week?

03:50.140 --> 03:57.140
My week was good. I actually was playing more PSP stuff than anything, which is pretty interesting.

03:57.180 --> 04:03.080
Complete opposite of before. What I've been playing lately has been Grand Theft Auto,

04:03.080 --> 04:07.660
and what it is is we've got four copies in the office at work, and the four of us go

04:07.660 --> 04:13.680
down every break, twice a day, and do four player deathmatch. And lately it's been pretty

04:13.680 --> 04:17.880
good. My boss has been getting a lot better, but I kicked the crap out of all of them the

04:17.880 --> 04:24.880
other day with my Janet Reno character who's a kickass sharpshooter with a rocket launcher.

04:25.660 --> 04:30.260
So I'm pretty deadly with that thing. And it's funny seeing Janet Reno run around with

04:30.260 --> 04:37.260
a chainsaw and murder people, but you know, don't underestimate old women. Awesome. Now

04:37.260 --> 04:40.380
has the multiplayer kind of increased your perception of the game? Because I remember

04:40.380 --> 04:43.820
last week you didn't really give it that great a review. You said it was kind of okay.

04:43.820 --> 04:48.300
It was okay. The multiplayer is really fun. The only thing though is I'm not really interested

04:48.300 --> 04:52.540
in the other multiplayer modes like the capture the flag and stuff. I think with the amount of

04:52.540 --> 04:59.900
players that supports, which is only six, it's not very enticing. It's just something that I think

04:59.900 --> 05:05.580
would be better with more players. But four player deathmatch is just really fun. The other game I

05:05.580 --> 05:09.580
was actually trying out today was Star Wars Battlefront 2 for the PSP. Now I haven't played

05:09.580 --> 05:13.980
the console version of the Star Wars Battlefront 2 yet, so I can't really compare the two,

05:13.980 --> 05:19.220
but it did seem pretty plain to me. The levels remind me of stuff that might have been on

05:19.220 --> 05:26.100
say the Playstation, like the original Playstation stuff. But other than that it was pretty fun.

05:26.100 --> 05:30.780
I did have trouble seeing some of the characters because they kind of blended into the background

05:30.780 --> 05:34.780
so that kind of sucked, but the space battles and stuff were pretty fun and I was just kind

05:34.780 --> 05:40.900
of reminded me of some of the older games for the Playstation 1 though, I can't remember

05:40.900 --> 05:46.140
the title off the top of my head, but really fun game and of course been playing War Warriors.

05:46.140 --> 05:51.140
That game's really cool, it just keeps getting better every level I play, so really awesome

05:51.140 --> 05:56.860
game and I didn't get a chance to play Shadow Colossus like I hoped, but hopefully gonna

05:56.860 --> 06:00.580
pick up Guitar Hero this week, and yeah.

06:00.580 --> 06:02.040
All right

06:02.040 --> 06:07.360
Now I was promising last week on the podcast that I would actually be giving a review of the Taito

06:08.020 --> 06:10.020
Collection that was recently released for Xbox

06:10.020 --> 06:15.760
However, I'm tabling that yet another week because I bought a game this week that kind of took up most of my game time

06:15.760 --> 06:20.640
And that was Guitar Hero. I know all three of us have mentioned now, but I really did I picked up Guitar Hero

06:20.920 --> 06:23.640
It's awesome. It's a great music game

06:23.640 --> 06:29.020
It's like fuse guitar freaks the Konami Guitar Freaks game if you've ever played it fuse that with

06:29.020 --> 06:34.420
amplitude frequency and it's really what you've got here except you know it's not

06:34.420 --> 06:39.300
really a guitar freaks clone it really does improve I think on that in fact it

06:39.300 --> 06:43.180
doesn't really seem inspired by guitar freaks as much as it does it seem

06:43.180 --> 06:46.980
inspired by frequency and amplitude and to some extent karaoke revolution as

06:46.980 --> 06:50.220
well because harmonics developed that game as well so I think those you guys

06:50.220 --> 06:53.660
that are kind of missing frequency and amplitude in those games you're gonna

06:53.660 --> 06:59.780
really enjoy Guitar Hero. It's pretty much the same idea with the ISO notes

06:59.780 --> 07:05.420
kind of falling down and great song list, freeze pops back, a lot of unsigned bands,

07:05.420 --> 07:10.420
great cover songs in this game. They're not the actual songs

07:10.420 --> 07:14.480
but they sound so much like them it's very hard to tell the difference.

07:14.480 --> 07:18.260
Harmonix did an outstanding job on this game. Red Octane put together a very good

07:18.260 --> 07:21.500
controller for the game. The controller is solid. It's even got a whammy bar

07:21.500 --> 07:25.900
people. It's got a whammy bar. What more do I need to say? It's a great game, I hope

07:25.900 --> 07:30.140
there's a sequel. Even if you're not that into music games, I think Guitar Hero is

07:30.140 --> 07:34.420
something very accessible. What I like about Guitar Hero, what I really like is

07:34.420 --> 07:38.700
the art direction. The artwork is outstanding, the way the game is put

07:38.700 --> 07:41.980
together is great, but where I think Guitar Hero really shines is it's not put

07:41.980 --> 07:46.420
together like most of Konami's Bamani games, where you walk up, play your game,

07:46.420 --> 07:50.300
leave. What I like about Guitar Hero is it's got that little story mode that

07:50.300 --> 07:54.620
kind of you know it's got it makes all these little extras so much fun like

07:54.620 --> 07:59.120
getting to see your review of how you did in the paper and having the you know

07:59.120 --> 08:02.220
blow up and the guitar you know spinning around when you're doing a really good

08:02.220 --> 08:07.380
job and just setting it on setting it on fire when you're done setting it on fire

08:07.380 --> 08:13.500
when you're done and all that stuff that it's just amazing the way they have it

08:13.500 --> 08:16.580
all put together is great so I highly recommend Guitar Hero if you're a music

08:16.580 --> 08:19.640
game fan if you're not a music game fan I do still recommend you check it out at

08:19.640 --> 08:23.060
it's one of the more accessible games and I'm definitely looking forward to

08:23.060 --> 08:26.420
Guitar Hero 2, which I think would be a given at this point because I did not

08:26.420 --> 08:31.220
just spend $70 on game and controller for there to only be this one game, okay?

08:31.220 --> 08:36.060
All right, now since it's been a little while since Dark Sakura has been able to

08:36.060 --> 08:39.560
be on the program, we have to start off tonight because she's got a little

08:39.560 --> 08:44.300
catch-up to do and you know that you missed it. It's the one and only

08:44.300 --> 08:48.220
advice column because you guys, if we stayed home and played video games all

08:48.220 --> 08:52.220
all day long. We'd have no time to go out and set guitars on fire.

08:52.220 --> 08:56.220
Rock. So, um, DarkSakura, why don't you tell us

08:56.220 --> 09:00.220
what your advice column is all about tonight?

09:00.220 --> 09:04.220
Today's piece of advice

09:04.220 --> 09:08.220
is how to escape from the trunk of a car.

09:08.220 --> 09:12.220
If you are, first of all, if you're dumb enough to get stuck in the trunk of a car

09:12.220 --> 09:16.220
you shouldn't have my mercy, but let's go ahead and be nice anyway.

09:16.220 --> 09:22.220
Number one, if you are in a trunk that is up against the back seat of a car, try to get the seats down.

09:22.220 --> 09:27.220
Number two, if the trunk has a cable release, pull on it to release the latch.

09:27.220 --> 09:32.220
Should I think any car built after, what was it, 86 was it?

09:32.220 --> 09:33.220
No idea.

09:33.220 --> 09:38.220
It's required by law to have, basically if you buy any new car, it's going to have a latch in it.

09:38.220 --> 09:40.220
It's required by law.

09:40.220 --> 09:49.220
Number 3. Look for tools to pry the latch open. Many cars have emergency kits under the spare tire. Use a screwdriver or crowbar to open the latch.

09:49.220 --> 09:52.220
Or, as in Beeps and Bowhead Do America, a jack.

09:52.220 --> 09:54.220
That was funny.

09:54.220 --> 10:03.220
4. Dismantle the car's brake lights by yanking wires and kicking the lights out. Then wave and yell and signal to passersby or other cars.

10:03.220 --> 10:05.220
But my final piece of advice?

10:05.220 --> 10:06.220
Yes.

10:06.220 --> 10:12.740
Just don't get stuck in the trunk, God.

10:12.740 --> 10:15.300
Don't make friends who are in the mafia.

10:15.300 --> 10:19.180
Yeah, don't make friends who are in the mafia.

10:19.180 --> 10:21.740
Don't try to sneak people into drive-throughs and all that stuff.

10:21.740 --> 10:22.740
Oh God.

10:22.740 --> 10:23.740
Or not drive-throughs, drive-ins.

10:23.740 --> 10:24.740
I remember though.

10:24.740 --> 10:25.740
Drive-throughs are a little different.

10:25.740 --> 10:26.740
What was it?

10:26.740 --> 10:27.740
Smiggle 2?

10:27.740 --> 10:28.740
Yes, Sunnyvale Golf Land DR.

10:28.740 --> 10:34.600
Right, where we do lanky style in the backseat of Iguan, in the trunk of Iguanagirl's car.

10:34.600 --> 10:38.400
So we could all make it over to Lion's, I remember that now, the restaurant.

10:38.400 --> 10:39.400
Hilarious.

10:39.400 --> 10:44.560
I've never seen paleness of that nature outside of the goth scene.

10:44.560 --> 10:48.520
You've never seen paleness of that nature, hmm?

10:48.520 --> 10:50.000
Outside of the goth scene.

10:50.000 --> 10:51.000
Okay.

10:51.000 --> 10:56.720
All right, anyway, let's move on and get into some stories tonight, what's going on in the

10:56.720 --> 10:58.520
gaming world.

10:58.520 --> 11:00.280
Starting off tonight, I thought we would bring this up.

11:00.280 --> 11:03.160
It's very interesting because on last week's show we were talking about how the video games

11:03.160 --> 11:05.840
live tour got canceled?

11:05.840 --> 11:13.740
Not even a week later, here it is, an announcement going out that Play, a video game symphony

11:13.740 --> 11:18.240
which is being put together by JMP Productions, who is the team behind Dear Friends Music

11:18.240 --> 11:22.160
from Final Fantasy, they are going to go on a worldwide tour.

11:22.160 --> 11:26.520
It's going to kick off in North America sometime in the year 2006 and it's going to have music

11:26.520 --> 11:33.360
from Battlefield 1942, World of Warcraft, Final Fantasy, The Elder Scrolls 3, and much

11:33.360 --> 11:35.360
much more.

11:35.360 --> 11:41.440
The maestro will be Arnie Roth, who I believe was the man at More Friends, I might be getting

11:41.440 --> 11:45.760
that wrong, I don't know, but it should be very interesting, the folks that put together

11:45.760 --> 11:47.720
Dear Friends are going to be doing this too.

11:47.720 --> 11:50.960
So what do you think, do you think this will be successful, where Video Games Live was

11:50.960 --> 11:53.440
not so successful, where it got cancelled, or what?

11:53.440 --> 11:56.720
they have the experience of at least putting on a show like this so we know that they're

11:56.720 --> 11:59.240
capable of it and it shouldn't be that much.

11:59.240 --> 12:04.480
To Video Games Live credit, they did do the Hollywood Bowl show, which was successful.

12:04.480 --> 12:09.000
But they have pulled off a successful tour at least around the United States and Japan

12:09.000 --> 12:10.000
and stuff.

12:10.000 --> 12:15.520
So, I think, Shin being different than a More Friends concert with different music, that's

12:15.520 --> 12:16.520
about it.

12:16.520 --> 12:21.040
I mean, it's not really anything different that they have to pull off, so yeah, sure,

12:21.040 --> 12:22.040
why not.

12:22.040 --> 12:28.040
Dark Sakura, is this a concert that sounds like something you'd want to go to? Maybe get a little culture with your game?

12:28.040 --> 12:39.040
Well, I listen to real classical music, but I don't know that it'd be worth the ticket unless they actually put stuff that people actually play.

12:39.040 --> 12:42.040
Well, lots of people play World of Warcraft and Final Fantasy.

12:42.040 --> 12:45.040
Well, that's not World of Warcraft and Final Fantasy, I'm talking about...

12:45.040 --> 12:50.040
It's not anything I have any interest in, maybe if it was like console games.

12:50.040 --> 12:53.720
well okay that's I guess that's true cuz most of those games we named off there

12:53.720 --> 12:56.400
were PC games but you got to assume that there's gonna be some console in there

12:56.400 --> 13:02.280
too I mean Final Fantasy console but we've seen that before maybe maybe

13:02.280 --> 13:09.240
everything you've named off are MMOs okay okay well not Battlefield 1942 oh yeah

13:09.240 --> 13:13.160
Battlefield 1942 that's true but that's still very it's kind of more known as a

13:13.160 --> 13:18.680
PC title I think all the scrolls is an MMO it's not an MMO but it's yeah yeah

13:18.680 --> 13:22.840
They're all PC games or at least we we need a console series like that

13:22.840 --> 13:25.640
So as long as it's an expansive eclectic

13:25.640 --> 13:32.920
But not like where they're including pong and Donkey Kong or whatever that other whatever that are you doing the other tour is promising

13:34.280 --> 13:38.920
Pong had no music in it. Well, I think that'd be no remix. Oh

13:40.120 --> 13:42.120
With beeping it. Oh, I'm sorry

13:42.500 --> 13:47.080
Alright. Yes. No. Alright, but how about how about some music from katamari?

13:47.080 --> 13:51.080
Would that sell the ticket if they put Katamari Damacy music in there?

13:51.080 --> 13:52.080
Maybe.

13:52.080 --> 13:54.080
That'd be weird, but okay.

13:54.080 --> 13:56.080
It'd be awesome.

13:56.080 --> 14:01.080
Alright, we're going to go into another story here, and this has to do, you know we love

14:01.080 --> 14:05.080
to talk about video games being made into movies, just because this happened so much

14:05.080 --> 14:07.080
this year, honestly, we've had a lot of gaming news.

14:07.080 --> 14:12.080
Well, the next one out the gate looks like it's going to be Castlevania.

14:12.080 --> 14:16.080
That's right, Crystal Sky Pictures has picked up the rights to adapt Castlevania

14:16.080 --> 14:20.080
and attached to direct Paul W.S. Anderson.

14:20.080 --> 14:24.080
Paul W.S. Anderson is the man behind Resident Evil and Mortal Kombat,

14:24.080 --> 14:26.080
which were pretty decent video game adaptations.

14:26.080 --> 14:29.080
Granted, better than Alone in the Dark, certainly.

14:29.080 --> 14:32.080
But let's not forget he also did Alien vs. Predator.

14:32.080 --> 14:35.080
So, what can you do?

14:35.080 --> 14:38.080
Anyway, so we don't know much about the story just yet.

14:38.080 --> 14:41.080
More information to come on this, but what do you guys think?

14:41.080 --> 14:45.080
I remember we do this segment on the live show called Listless

14:45.080 --> 14:49.960
where we make our top three list of things that should happen within the

14:49.960 --> 14:54.520
video game community I know we did one time we did video game we would most

14:54.520 --> 14:57.560
like to see a movie made out of and I seem to remember Castlevania being in

14:57.560 --> 15:03.760
the top three so is this a good idea or a bad idea I did have to do it right I

15:03.760 --> 15:09.760
would be very skeptical what what what do you think they could do to help this

15:09.760 --> 15:12.360
this along.

15:12.360 --> 15:17.360
Well not screw up the content hopefully keep true to the game and make sure that the publishers

15:17.360 --> 15:24.120
of the game had creative control over it.

15:24.120 --> 15:30.700
That would be my guess is make sure that they are definitely keeping tabs on what's going

15:30.700 --> 15:36.320
on with the game so it stays true to the storyline and content and everything like that.

15:36.320 --> 15:41.760
Okay, what we're going to do now is I promised a little earlier in the show is that we were

15:41.760 --> 15:45.120
going to talk a little bit about a follow-up to something we talked about a couple weeks

15:45.120 --> 15:46.120
ago.

15:46.120 --> 15:47.120
I don't know if you guys heard about this.

15:47.120 --> 15:50.400
Did you guys hear about the King's Quest IX fan project that was going on?

15:50.400 --> 15:54.800
Now you know the King's Quest series was developed by Sierra years and years ago, right?

15:54.800 --> 15:56.400
Of course you remember the old King's Quest games.

15:56.400 --> 16:00.880
I know my favorite is the King's Quest IV, the one that kind of seemed very inspired

16:00.880 --> 16:03.280
by a lot of different fairy tales.

16:03.280 --> 16:06.940
Well the series actually ended with King's Quest VIII and what happened is that Vivendi

16:06.940 --> 16:13.160
actually bought Sierra and decided to discontinue making King's Quest games because they felt

16:13.160 --> 16:17.460
there wasn't enough demand for these adventure series anymore.

16:17.460 --> 16:19.500
So they stopped making the games.

16:19.500 --> 16:22.300
Well the fan community, and there's quite a community out there for the King's Quest

16:22.300 --> 16:25.180
games, wasn't happy with that answer.

16:25.180 --> 16:30.400
So there's some folks that got together and decided they were going to make a fan game.

16:30.400 --> 16:34.680
But as we reported on the show a couple of weeks ago, Vivendi actually issued a cease

16:34.680 --> 16:39.920
and desist against the company that was coming together to make this King's Quest IX game.

16:39.920 --> 16:44.360
So we have on the show tonight an interview with some of the people that are involved

16:44.360 --> 16:50.320
with the King's Quest IX project, one of them being somebody who is trying to save the King's

16:50.320 --> 16:55.120
Quest IX game and somebody close with the King's Quest IX production team.

16:55.120 --> 16:59.400
So I've got here with me Matt from the Save King's Quest IX project.

16:59.400 --> 17:01.840
Thank you very much for being on the show here today, Matt.

17:01.840 --> 17:02.840
Thank you for having me.

17:02.840 --> 17:03.840
No problem.

17:03.840 --> 17:08.360
So how did you discover the King's Quest IX project?

17:08.360 --> 17:11.960
You know, it's been so many years now, I don't really remember.

17:11.960 --> 17:14.560
How long has the King's Quest IX project been going on?

17:14.560 --> 17:17.600
I believe it's been going on for about four years.

17:17.600 --> 17:19.240
For about four years, wow.

17:19.240 --> 17:22.080
So it's been a long-time project in the making.

17:22.080 --> 17:23.080
Absolutely.

17:23.080 --> 17:27.600
So what was your reaction to the news that Vivendi had issued the cease and desist against

17:27.600 --> 17:28.600
the project?

17:28.600 --> 17:35.200
I think like a lot of fans, disappointment, you know, sadness and disappointment.

17:35.200 --> 17:40.560
So why then did you end up starting the SaveKQIX.org website?

17:40.560 --> 17:43.480
Well because I was disappointed and because I knew there were a lot of fans that were

17:43.480 --> 17:44.480
disappointed.

17:44.480 --> 17:49.760
I just wanted to try to do something to help, wanted to do something to try to help convince

17:49.760 --> 17:54.800
the Vendi to take a look at this and see if there was a way that the game could be released.

17:54.800 --> 17:59.180
Now I noticed when I was looking at the website that you guys are kind of taking a unique

17:59.180 --> 18:04.440
approach to trying to kind of petition Vivendi, so to speak, to take a second look at what

18:04.440 --> 18:09.520
theyíre doing here and most people would use like a petition online type website for

18:09.520 --> 18:13.620
these sorts of drives, but you guys are advising a letter writing campaign.

18:13.620 --> 18:16.400
Why did you decide to do the letter writing as opposed to petition online?

18:16.400 --> 18:18.520
Well, weíre actually doing a number of things.

18:18.520 --> 18:24.240
One, weíre doing the email writing and then weíre also doing the letter writing.

18:24.240 --> 18:28.880
The email thing, the reason we're going with email rather than a petition was because we

18:28.880 --> 18:34.520
wanted to make sure that when people emailed, it was coming from a legitimate email address.

18:34.520 --> 18:38.760
On an online petition, you can just type in whatever email address you want, so it isn't

18:38.760 --> 18:41.400
necessarily legitimate.

18:41.400 --> 18:45.720
And then the letter writing campaign, we want as many people as possible to take the time

18:45.720 --> 18:51.200
to sit down and write a letter, drop it in the mail, because really those letters mean

18:51.200 --> 18:56.200
the most to corporations like Vivendi.

18:56.200 --> 19:00.520
What would be the ideal outcome of this Save King's Quest 9 drive?

19:00.520 --> 19:06.440
What do you envision as a realistic possibility for the masses to be able to play the game?

19:06.440 --> 19:09.280
Our goal is for the game to be released.

19:09.280 --> 19:16.080
Whether it's released as freeware or whether it's released as a legitimate commercial release

19:16.080 --> 19:18.540
by Vivendi, we don't really care.

19:18.540 --> 19:22.660
We just want the game to be out there for gamers to play it.

19:22.660 --> 19:26.980
How big would you say is the community behind this, because I noticed that the King's Quest

19:26.980 --> 19:32.040
community out there is still very large and very active, and part of the reason Vivendi

19:32.040 --> 19:35.080
has sort of said they're not going to continue the series in the past is because they don't

19:35.080 --> 19:38.840
think they have the support, but it seems to me that there's a very large following

19:38.840 --> 19:39.840
out there.

19:39.840 --> 19:42.100
How big would you say is the King's Quest following out there?

19:42.100 --> 19:55.100
It's hard to give a specific number, but I do believe that there is enough support out there that a commercial release of a King's Quest IX would do well.

19:55.100 --> 19:58.100
I mean, adventure games in general are still being released.

19:58.100 --> 20:07.100
You know, Fahrenheit just came out, The Longest Journey is releasing a sequel, Siberia had two games that sold very well.

20:07.100 --> 20:13.100
So I think there still is a pretty good adventure game community out there, but it's hard to

20:13.100 --> 20:14.940
put an exact number on it.

20:14.940 --> 20:20.140
How would you feel if Vivendi took all this information to see that there was a drive

20:20.140 --> 20:26.140
to have the King's Quest series reignited, and then they decided to put out their own

20:26.140 --> 20:28.940
game, as opposed to what these fans have been working on?

20:28.940 --> 20:32.380
Is that something you would support, or would that be...

20:32.380 --> 20:39.340
So, we really would like to see this particular King's Quest game be released.

20:39.340 --> 20:43.900
But yeah, we would certainly support Vivendi if they decided they wanted to do their own

20:43.900 --> 20:45.380
King's Quest game.

20:45.380 --> 20:47.360
So you would prefer to see this game released?

20:47.360 --> 20:50.000
I would like to see this game released.

20:50.000 --> 20:54.740
I'd love to see them allow this game to come out as a fan game, and then they can release

20:54.740 --> 20:57.820
their own official version of King's Quest IX.

20:57.820 --> 21:04.340
All right, so I know we have a lot of PC gaming fans that listen to this program, so how can

21:04.340 --> 21:05.340
they help?

21:05.340 --> 21:09.900
I know we've talked about writing letters, visiting the website, savekqix.org.

21:09.900 --> 21:13.520
How can our listeners best help you guys out if they remember the King's Quest games and

21:13.520 --> 21:16.120
would love to see a new entry in the series?

21:16.120 --> 21:23.500
The best thing they can do to help is go visit the website, www.savekqix.org.

21:23.500 --> 21:27.060
On the website, we talk about all the different things that they can do to help.

21:27.060 --> 21:31.540
The big thing we're focusing on is sending an email to Vivendi, and we make that very

21:31.540 --> 21:34.120
easy to do on our website.

21:34.120 --> 21:36.140
You can also blog about us.

21:36.140 --> 21:41.220
You can write a letter to Vivendi like we already talked about, send emails out to all

21:41.220 --> 21:44.020
your friends about us, just help us spread the word.

21:44.020 --> 21:46.780
That's the other really important thing that we need people to do.

21:46.780 --> 21:50.260
All right, so we hope our listeners can help you guys get the word out there.

21:50.260 --> 21:52.360
All right, thanks, Matt, so much for being on the show today.

21:52.360 --> 21:53.360
We appreciate it.

21:53.360 --> 21:54.360
Thank you.

21:54.360 --> 22:03.760
We also decided to contact Cesar, and Cesar is involved with the King's Quest IX project

22:03.760 --> 22:04.760
itself.

22:04.760 --> 22:06.720
Thank you so much for being on the show today, Cesar.

22:06.720 --> 22:11.160
Thank you very much for having me in your show.

22:11.160 --> 22:14.320
We know that's happening on King's Quest IX right now.

22:14.320 --> 22:19.760
I'm pretty busy right now, but I can't stop the opportunity to be on the show.

22:19.760 --> 22:23.080
We appreciate you taking the time out to help us out with the show.

22:23.080 --> 22:26.720
What is your role with the King's Quest IX project, for those who may not know?

22:26.720 --> 22:30.080
I'm basically the project director and I'm also the main designer.

22:30.080 --> 22:37.120
I basically take the responsibility of having everything going smoothly and handing the

22:37.120 --> 22:39.040
assignment to all the people.

22:39.040 --> 22:44.880
I also wrote a script that came out to be more than 50 hundred pages.

22:44.880 --> 22:47.080
It's a really long script.

22:47.080 --> 22:49.320
Wow, that's a huge script.

22:49.320 --> 22:52.600
Could you tell us a little bit about what the story is about?

22:52.600 --> 22:57.000
Does it continue the King's Quest series or is it a new direction or could you tell

22:57.000 --> 22:58.320
us a little bit about the story?

22:58.320 --> 23:00.660
It's a little bit of both.

23:00.660 --> 23:07.220
We want to give some kind of closure to the King's Quest series, but it also takes a

23:07.220 --> 23:11.800
new direction in the sense that it's a much more darker story.

23:11.800 --> 23:16.460
We want to create something more for this time.

23:16.460 --> 23:21.880
When you see stories like Harry Potter and Lord of the Rings and all that kind of stories

23:21.880 --> 23:24.120
that take a much more darker plot.

23:24.120 --> 23:27.280
We wanted to take the beginning to that direction,

23:27.280 --> 23:30.400
but you can actually say that it's between King's Quest

23:30.400 --> 23:32.520
and Lord of the Rings.

23:32.520 --> 23:34.840
Of the story, it basically starts

23:34.840 --> 23:37.880
when in the middle of the celebration

23:37.880 --> 23:41.320
in the Green Isles, a lot of stuff happens,

23:41.320 --> 23:45.000
and a direct disturbance falls into the land.

23:45.000 --> 23:51.160
And King Graham sets out to find a way to reverse the spell.

23:51.160 --> 23:56.800
As he does that, he finds out that thereís a lot more involved.

23:56.800 --> 24:03.880
Itís about a property that has been taking place for a thousand years and there are societies

24:03.880 --> 24:04.880
involved in this.

24:04.880 --> 24:09.360
Itís a really complicated and long story.

24:09.360 --> 24:12.720
With 1,500 pages, I canít imagine.

24:12.720 --> 24:18.360
With all that work, having gone into it with the script and your entire team of programmers

24:18.360 --> 24:21.880
and art and just everything that goes into this.

24:21.880 --> 24:27.820
Is it tough having spent all these hours and then having Vivendi come in and issue this

24:27.820 --> 24:28.820
cease and desist?

24:28.820 --> 24:31.480
I mean what was your guys' reaction to this news?

24:31.480 --> 24:38.400
Well, all this time we knew that it could happen and we were kind of ready for that

24:38.400 --> 24:45.660
to happen and as Phoenix Online Studios we weren't going to stop working as a company

24:45.660 --> 24:53.540
Even if we had to change all the stuff that we had into something new, what we wanted

24:53.540 --> 24:59.100
to do was try to get Kings vs. Knights to happen commercially.

24:59.100 --> 25:04.180
In the case that that didn't happen, we had a plan B where we basically could create

25:04.180 --> 25:08.500
our own game with everything that we had until that point.

25:08.500 --> 25:13.500
Of course, we would have to change a lot of the stuff that we had, but it's doable.

25:13.500 --> 25:17.540
I was kind of curious about that when we first talked about this story when it kind of hit

25:17.540 --> 25:19.620
the news a couple of weeks ago.

25:19.620 --> 25:24.500
Some of us had joked that they could take King's Quest and make it Queen's Journey

25:24.500 --> 25:27.460
or something by changing all the art and stuff.

25:27.460 --> 25:29.220
Is that a realistic plan B?

25:29.220 --> 25:36.860
Well, I wouldn't say that because Queen's Journey is definitely a good joke.

25:36.860 --> 25:37.860
Well, I know.

25:37.860 --> 25:43.060
It's a silly name, but the same idea behind just changing the names and things that may

25:43.060 --> 25:46.700
relate to the King's Quest story and just kind of changing it so that this game could

25:46.700 --> 25:48.340
come out as its own series?

25:48.340 --> 25:49.340
Right.

25:49.340 --> 25:53.820
But we will basically have to strip it off from a lot of stuff that it has, because we

25:53.820 --> 25:57.080
used a lot of the backstory of King's Quest.

25:57.080 --> 26:03.580
Like I say, we wanted to bring a closure to the series, so if we were to make it a regional

26:03.580 --> 26:06.380
game, we would have to work a lot on it.

26:06.380 --> 26:07.380
But it's doable.

26:07.380 --> 26:09.420
I mean, it's not impossible.

26:09.420 --> 26:15.900
Now, I'm sure you're aware of this savekqix.org website where they're trying to get people

26:15.900 --> 26:20.660
to send letters to Vivendi to save this project.

26:20.660 --> 26:25.460
Are you willing to talk to Vivendi one-on-one, sit down at the table and try to work this

26:25.460 --> 26:26.460
out?

26:26.460 --> 26:32.240
We're basically already talking to Vivendi, but that's about all I can say at the moment

26:32.240 --> 26:38.380
because we are under a constitutional agreement, so there's not much I can say about that.

26:38.380 --> 26:43.540
the Safe King Quest 9 side and all the clients that are trying to help out, I really appreciate

26:43.540 --> 26:44.540
their support.

26:44.540 --> 26:50.580
I want to take the time to thank them because everything that they've been doing has been

26:50.580 --> 26:52.900
working out.

26:52.900 --> 26:58.980
I want to ask them if they're going to do it, be really nice to them because they're

26:58.980 --> 27:00.540
actually being nice to us.

27:00.540 --> 27:05.660
No letters sending over to them like saying, �You bastards are shutting down the project!�

27:05.660 --> 27:06.660
No, be professional.

27:06.660 --> 27:07.660
Be professional.

27:07.660 --> 27:14.620
That is what you are going to say, and that is because Bivendi has owned those rights

27:14.620 --> 27:21.620
and they are on their right to protect them, and they have seen the work that we have been

27:21.620 --> 27:28.260
doing in King's Quest and now they are talking to us, but what is going to happen, I don't

27:28.260 --> 27:29.260
know.

27:29.260 --> 27:34.020
We'll just have to wait and see.

27:34.020 --> 27:37.860
Thank you so much for being on the show today, Cesar, and best of luck to you and your company,

27:37.860 --> 27:42.620
whether it be a King's Quest IX release or releasing this game as something else in the

27:42.620 --> 27:43.620
future.

27:43.620 --> 27:46.860
I hope it's successful, and best of luck to you guys.

27:46.860 --> 27:51.380
Thank you very much, and thank you very much for having me in the show.

27:51.380 --> 27:52.380
Not a problem.

27:52.380 --> 27:57.740
It was very interesting to hear from Cesar and Matt, both involved in different capacities,

27:57.740 --> 28:01.460
the community around the King's Quest games and what I think is really interesting about

28:01.460 --> 28:05.340
this whole thing is that there is a really solid community behind these King's Quest

28:05.340 --> 28:10.280
games and I think, you know, at least me, my personal thoughts on King's Quest is like

28:10.280 --> 28:14.180
it was one of those games I always appreciated and I thought was so much fun and I always

28:14.180 --> 28:17.540
kind of wonder, gee, I wonder what ever happened to King's Quest, why did they stop making

28:17.540 --> 28:18.540
King's Quest games?

28:18.540 --> 28:22.300
I don't know, is it just me that's feeling that way or, I don't know.

28:22.300 --> 28:26.920
Why haven't they made most of the Sierra games? I mean a lot of them have disappeared just

28:26.920 --> 28:30.500
I don't know, like Space Quest, Police Quest

28:30.500 --> 28:34.740
The only one I can think of that came out was Leisure Suit Larry but that was kind of

28:34.740 --> 28:38.540
not the same thing at all and a god I hope

28:38.540 --> 28:41.580
I hope that if Avendi continues King's Quest it doesn't

28:41.580 --> 28:45.820
I hope they stick to what made King's Quest work and the formula that was good for the game

28:45.820 --> 28:48.860
but best of luck to these guys definitely so

28:48.860 --> 28:57.860
It's really neat to see the community come together like that, you know, no matter what community in game, what sub-community of the gaming culture it is.

28:57.860 --> 29:00.860
I just agree that the email should be kept constructive.

29:00.860 --> 29:07.860
Absolutely. You could do damaging stuff to this if you don't keep your emails professional, keep it professional.

29:07.860 --> 29:10.860
And we hope some of our listeners will choose to help these folks out.

29:10.860 --> 29:13.860
I think I'm going to write a letter myself because I would like to see this happen.

29:13.860 --> 29:17.380
least I want to see the King's Quest franchise continue you know in some way

29:17.380 --> 29:22.460
and I hope I hope these guys get their way anyway moving on one to bring up

29:22.460 --> 29:26.660
another story and it has to do with the Simpsons you know the TV show the

29:26.660 --> 29:31.540
Simpsons you know they've had all these games come out you know in the few years

29:31.540 --> 29:36.780
and they've been kind of a none of them have been that great really except maybe

29:36.780 --> 29:40.860
Simpsons hit and run but even that was kind of a well things are going to

29:40.860 --> 29:45.420
change because Electronic Arts just recently signed a deal with 20th Century

29:45.420 --> 29:50.760
Fox and Gracie Films which is going to give now EA the rights to produce the

29:50.760 --> 29:54.960
future Simpsons games so now you know EA is behind a lot of powerhouse games

29:54.960 --> 29:57.820
they are going to be creating the Simpsons games now so what do you think

29:57.820 --> 30:01.940
good news for the Simpsons bad news for the Simpsons I don't play Simpsons games

30:01.940 --> 30:10.420
what can only wait and see can't be that bad I suppose but I don't know it's

30:10.420 --> 30:16.140
It's really, I can't really make distinction based on that because, who knows.

30:16.140 --> 30:20.720
But I would like to see less parodies of existing games, because that's kind of what the EA

30:20.720 --> 30:23.860
franchise, or I mean not EA, the Simpsons franchise seems to have been built on the

30:23.860 --> 30:27.540
past couple games as parodies of existing, I kind of want to see less of that in something

30:27.540 --> 30:29.980
original like a Simpsons game.

30:29.980 --> 30:30.980
I don't know.

30:30.980 --> 30:33.100
Do you remember Bart's Nightmare on the Super Nintendo?

30:33.100 --> 30:38.420
I actually own that game, anyway, forget it.

30:38.420 --> 30:42.460
Some more details coming out this week on the brand new Super Mario Brothers.

30:42.460 --> 30:45.160
This is a game coming out for the Nintendo DS.

30:45.160 --> 30:51.360
It's going to have wireless two-player action as well as mini-games for up to four players,

30:51.360 --> 30:54.440
and this is all coming out in the latest issue of Famitsu Magazine.

30:54.440 --> 31:00.160
Will it also include a playable copy of Mario Brothers, like every other Mario Brothers

31:00.160 --> 31:02.160
game that it released on advance?

31:02.160 --> 31:03.160
Oh yeah.

31:03.160 --> 31:07.960
I don't know, although I can't see how it couldn't have it, but maybe they could make

31:07.960 --> 31:13.680
a touch element in here I don't know so this is going to be a versus mode that

31:13.680 --> 31:16.920
will be two players and you can't do four players in the versus mode that's

31:16.920 --> 31:20.700
only for the minigames so this new Super Mario Brothers is going to use 3d

31:20.700 --> 31:25.080
graphics but it's like a side-scrolling game which I think is a great direction

31:25.080 --> 31:28.000
for the series I think it's a little weird it's coming out on DS and not an

31:28.000 --> 31:32.520
actual system because I remember the first time I played the Mario level

31:32.520 --> 31:36.560
inside Super Smash Brothers Melee I was like damn they

31:36.560 --> 31:40.500
should make a game out of this this looks great and it plays wonderful

31:40.500 --> 31:45.080
I don't know so but it sounds like maybe they're kind of heading in this

31:45.080 --> 31:48.040
direction a little bit with the new Super Mario Brothers so I am kind of

31:48.040 --> 31:53.920
excited Loki what do you got for us tonight well not too much did want to

31:53.920 --> 31:59.520
mention though there was a press release put out by 2k games the people behind

31:59.520 --> 32:05.160
Elder Scrolls 4 unfortunately it looks like the Elder Scrolls 4 has been pushed

32:05.160 --> 32:14.360
back to the next fiscal year 4, take 2, that would mean somewhere around, I don't know,

32:14.360 --> 32:15.360
next year.

32:15.360 --> 32:21.280
Unfortunately, after February, I believe the date I saw was like April or something.

32:21.280 --> 32:25.000
Very sad, because that was one of the games I was looking forward to.

32:25.000 --> 32:30.200
The other thing about the 360 is it's been rumored and actually kind of starting to look

32:30.200 --> 32:37.200
like it might actually be true now is Microsoft is purposefully shortening the allocations

32:37.420 --> 32:42.520
that each one of these stores is going to get to basically increase demand by having

32:42.520 --> 32:48.900
them sell out. I'm very disappointed that that's happening, but on our live show actually

32:48.900 --> 32:53.380
we found out there are some places that you can find 360s if you haven't ordered one yet

32:53.380 --> 32:59.660
or really need to get one on launch day. One of the places being Toys R Us is actually

32:59.660 --> 33:03.540
doing pre-orders on them, you have to do a bundle, but it's with a couple games, but

33:03.540 --> 33:06.540
I mean everyone's going to be picking up a couple games anyways.

33:06.540 --> 33:12.340
And also stores like Target and Best Buy are going to be opening up at six in the morning.

33:12.340 --> 33:16.660
Best Buy rumored to have a larger allocation than most other stores because supposedly

33:16.660 --> 33:22.700
Bill Gates is going to be pimping the 360 in the Manhattan Best Buy.

33:22.700 --> 33:28.580
You know, I played one of those Xbox 360 kiosks at Best Buy over the week, and I don't know.

33:28.580 --> 33:32.000
I don't know if I feel the need to get one of these on launch day anymore, I think it

33:32.000 --> 33:34.040
just might be too much hype for me.

33:34.040 --> 33:36.500
I don't think the games...

33:36.500 --> 33:37.500
I don't know.

33:37.500 --> 33:40.540
It's hard to say because it was only a couple games and I didn't get to play them very long,

33:40.540 --> 33:42.720
but I'm feeling a little iffy on this.

33:42.720 --> 33:45.260
I don't know if this is one of those like have to have on launch day things.

33:45.260 --> 33:48.780
I don't really feel like putting up with all this shortage crap to get one right away.

33:48.780 --> 33:49.780
I don't know.

33:49.780 --> 33:51.020
I don't know how I feel about it now.

33:51.020 --> 33:54.340
Well, I've already got mine ordered, so...

33:54.340 --> 33:58.200
I'm hoping, I've got to check with them tomorrow because I'm going to go in and buy some more

33:58.200 --> 34:05.220
stuff to see if I'm actually getting it on launch day or not because it, I don't know,

34:05.220 --> 34:06.220
it's iffy.

34:06.220 --> 34:09.720
And I'm going to be very disappointed if I don't because I did pre-order mine way in

34:09.720 --> 34:14.020
advance and I've heard people that pre-ordered it back in June when they didn't even have

34:14.020 --> 34:19.280
two SKUs available and even they aren't getting one on launch.

34:19.280 --> 34:23.560
But then again, that was an employee so things are going to get ugly.

34:23.560 --> 34:28.220
Things are going to get ugly, and you know, I'm kind of hoping, you know, that if this

34:28.220 --> 34:32.380
all pans out, you know, like it is where there's tons of shortages, all we need is another

34:32.380 --> 34:35.500
company like Sony or Nintendo to go, hey, guess what?

34:35.500 --> 34:39.820
Our system's coming out in a few months here, you know, pick one up if you're pissed off

34:39.820 --> 34:42.380
with this stuff, you know, we're going to have better games anyways or something.

34:42.380 --> 34:43.780
It'll be interesting, we'll see.

34:43.780 --> 34:50.520
All right, anyway, let's go over to Dark Sakura and see what news she has for us tonight.

34:50.520 --> 34:56.760
First of all, the new images for Silent Hill, the movie, have been posted on IGN.

34:56.760 --> 34:58.760
Ooh, there's another movie.

34:58.760 --> 35:00.640
We've said this on many previous episodes.

35:00.640 --> 35:02.840
Very excited about the Silent Hill movie.

35:02.840 --> 35:05.800
It's uh, yeah, it looks like Silent Hill.

35:05.800 --> 35:07.640
It's very, very Silent Hill.

35:07.640 --> 35:13.800
I mean, the outfits, just, it's really hard for me to really explain it unless you go

35:13.800 --> 35:17.320
and look at the images and it looks like it's right from the game.

35:17.320 --> 35:22.160
you sure that they're not pictures of Silent Hill 5 on the PlayStation 3 no

35:22.160 --> 35:26.440
because PlayStation 3 doesn't look at that realistic all right but these are

35:26.440 --> 35:33.840
good shots very good also for our European listeners I have some news

35:33.840 --> 35:42.160
about the DS Wi-Fi connection hotspots mmm 7500 actually says over 7500 Wi-Fi

35:42.160 --> 35:47.240
connection hotspots will be active in the UK from November 25th when Mario

35:47.240 --> 35:52.960
cart DS launches there. It's actually the surface is going to be rolling out of

35:52.960 --> 35:57.960
the rest of Europe at that time. Places included McDonald's, Coffee Republic,

35:57.960 --> 36:04.480
Hilton, Ramada Jarvis Hotels, Road Chef, Welcome Break, First Great Western

36:04.480 --> 36:09.880
Railway Station, over 25 student unions and city center, BT payphones, airports,

36:09.880 --> 36:13.720
football stadiums, British Library, Canary Wharf. Where can't you go to get on?

36:13.720 --> 36:14.720
All over the place.

36:14.720 --> 36:15.720
All over the place.

36:15.720 --> 36:16.720
All over the place.

36:16.720 --> 36:17.720
What about McDonald's?

36:17.720 --> 36:18.720
Because, you know, that was big news here.

36:18.720 --> 36:20.720
I said that was the first thing I listed.

36:20.720 --> 36:21.720
Oh, I'm sorry.

36:21.720 --> 36:22.720
I missed that.

36:22.720 --> 36:23.720
Sorry.

36:23.720 --> 36:30.720
But there's a, it was basically a, if our UK listeners want to see a little bit more

36:30.720 --> 36:41.200
on that, if you go to www.thecloud.net or www.btopenzone.com, there's some Wi-Fi hotspot

36:41.200 --> 36:47.140
maps there games also that another one mentioned that's available for the plan

36:47.140 --> 36:50.080
that of course is Tony Hawk's American skate land which will be released over

36:50.080 --> 36:56.400
there on November 18th speaking of release dates I have release dates cool

36:56.400 --> 37:02.080
I'm sorry I you know missed the other week that's all right of course a

37:02.080 --> 37:07.600
twisted metal head-on came out xenosaga episode 2 came out coming out on the

37:07.600 --> 37:15.160
11th, we are looking at Zook Tycoon 2, Battleground Europe, Bubble Bobble Revolution, Cold War,

37:15.160 --> 37:21.520
Crime Life, Gang Wars, Gun, Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, Legion Arena on PC, Lost

37:21.520 --> 37:29.920
in Blue on DS, Super Mario Superstar Baseball, Nano Stray, Sly 3, The Incredibles, The Matrix

37:29.920 --> 37:34.120
Path of Neo, WWE Smackdown vs Raw 2006.

37:34.120 --> 37:37.480
There's a lot, a lot of games coming out soon.

37:37.480 --> 37:38.480
Good stuff.

37:38.480 --> 37:43.680
Kind of on the same vein, I actually was pulled up a calendar that shows what Nintendo's got

37:43.680 --> 37:47.320
planned for the first quarter and next year, and there's some really exciting titles coming

37:47.320 --> 37:48.320
out.

37:48.320 --> 37:54.960
Electroplankton is out on January 9th, True Swing Golf out January 23rd, and Super Princess

37:54.960 --> 37:55.960
Peach, also.

37:55.960 --> 37:56.960
Looking forward to that.

37:56.960 --> 37:59.240
Yeah, it should be very interesting.

37:59.240 --> 38:03.760
It's kind of a girl power type game, but as long as it's not done cheesy, it should be,

38:03.760 --> 38:07.220
has the potential to be really good. I mean, I know a lot of people that will pick Peach

38:07.220 --> 38:09.260
in Mario Party, just to dominate.

38:09.260 --> 38:13.140
Just to point out a few more of the notables coming out this month, uh, Dr. Mario and Tetris

38:13.140 --> 38:18.940
Attack on the Game Boy Advance on the 25th, Soul Calibur 3 on the 18th, Sonic Rush on

38:18.940 --> 38:25.620
the 18th, Pokemon XD Gale of Darkness on the 18th, and Namco Museum Battle Collection.

38:25.620 --> 38:27.620
Also coming out of Half-Life 2 on Xbox.

38:27.620 --> 38:32.580
I was going to say that the, oh damn I just lost it.

38:32.580 --> 38:36.140
Yeah well I know those are the UK dates.

38:36.140 --> 38:41.260
The thing is, I was going to say, I saw a ton of big games kind of this week, especially

38:41.260 --> 38:45.420
The Matrix and stuff. I was surprised to see that they're getting the

38:45.420 --> 38:49.220
SmackDown vs. Raw before us, which is kind of neat.

38:49.220 --> 38:53.340
I didn't think wrestling was as big of a deal anywhere else but here.

38:53.340 --> 38:57.580
I know. News to me. It's interesting. Actually I found another notable

38:57.580 --> 38:59.980
Shadow the Hedgehog on the 25th.

38:59.980 --> 39:07.980
The other thing I was going to mention though, is Electroplankton I heard is only going to be available online or in the Nintendo Manhattan store.

39:07.980 --> 39:11.780
So, you're not going to be able to find it in your local retailer.

39:11.780 --> 39:17.780
I have heard that same thing, that it's only going to be available online, which is a very strange way to sell the game.

39:17.780 --> 39:23.780
I don't know if they're trying to make a collector's item out of it or what, but we'll see.

39:23.780 --> 39:27.280
I know I'm gonna pick it up. I'm definitely interested in electroplankton.

39:27.280 --> 39:31.680
Looks like a fun game. So, anyway, Dark Sakura, looks like

39:31.680 --> 39:36.040
you've got to run and go save the

39:36.040 --> 39:39.200
save the planet from invaders or something right now, so.

39:39.200 --> 39:42.720
Or at least save myself from

39:42.720 --> 39:46.240
an F in Dreamweaver class.

39:46.240 --> 39:49.920
Well, your final thought for our listeners tonight, Dark Sakura?

39:49.920 --> 39:53.040
Do your homework. Do it early in the week.

39:53.040 --> 40:00.600
Alright, moving on, I want to talk about the PSP, because I just talked a few minutes ago

40:00.600 --> 40:03.600
about the DS games coming out first quarter, well here's something that's going to be coming

40:03.600 --> 40:09.720
out for the PSP in not too long, it's going to be a Gradius collection, it's coming out

40:09.720 --> 40:16.800
on February 9th, and it's Gradius Portable, it's a compilation of Gradius 1-4 and Gradius

40:16.800 --> 40:17.800
Gaiden.

40:17.800 --> 40:21.960
It's going to be coming out, it's a straight port of the previous games, but they're going

40:21.960 --> 40:27.300
to be adding a few bonus features as well and also you can stretch to the

40:27.300 --> 40:31.020
widescreen otherwise you can just play in its original aspect ratio so the game

40:31.020 --> 40:34.140
doesn't look all stretched but you can you have the choice to do it either way

40:34.140 --> 40:36.940
I thought it wasn't actually stretched I thought there were new versions of the

40:36.940 --> 40:43.260
game available there were in the widescreen mode um I Oh grottius one and

40:43.260 --> 40:47.020
two will have the widescreen mode so well grottius one and two will the other

40:47.020 --> 40:56.020
ones not so much. Now here's the biggest thing that's going to come with this, a save feature.

40:56.020 --> 41:01.100
So no more getting all the way to level 6 and losing all your lives in the end. You

41:01.100 --> 41:06.420
know what's kind of interesting about that? No Salamander or Life Force as it is.

41:06.420 --> 41:08.620
No Wi-Fi 2 player either.

41:08.620 --> 41:13.180
Yeah, too bad. Maybe for the sequel, maybe that's what they're holding out on, who knows.

41:13.180 --> 41:14.620
Loki, what else you got for us?

41:14.620 --> 41:20.220
Well, speaking of the PSP, the PSP2TV, I believe,

41:20.220 --> 41:22.580
was launched this week, or I should

41:22.580 --> 41:24.860
say is launching this week.

41:24.860 --> 41:26.940
They have had a few videos coming out

41:26.940 --> 41:29.220
showing how to install this thing.

41:29.220 --> 41:33.020
And oh my god, this is not for your average user of a PSP.

41:33.020 --> 41:35.440
You have to literally disassemble the entire thing,

41:35.440 --> 41:38.220
rip the guts out, put new guts back in, and you're done.

41:38.220 --> 41:41.220
And it's just not pretty.

41:41.220 --> 41:47.580
But if you are out there and you want to spend $120 to pick this thing up, it does look pretty

41:47.580 --> 41:48.580
cool.

41:48.580 --> 41:54.540
The graphics don't look that bad, but damn, it's definitely voiding the warranty on this

41:54.540 --> 41:55.540
thing.

41:55.540 --> 41:57.100
You have to have an electronics degree to be able to put this together.

41:57.100 --> 42:02.900
Well, you know, it's actually all screws and no actually soldering or anything like that,

42:02.900 --> 42:09.300
but you are unhooking some ribbon cables and stuff that are very, very delicate and it's

42:09.300 --> 42:14.000
not for your average consumer to be able to do this stuff. Now granted, if you do want

42:14.000 --> 42:19.560
to have some TV support and you're not willing to break open your PSP, there are some other

42:19.560 --> 42:23.720
options coming out. One being, it's kind of like this thing that sticks over the entire

42:23.720 --> 42:28.500
screen and basically captures the video from the image. I'm not going to say that that's

42:28.500 --> 42:33.440
going to be probably that great of a picture, but you know, that's another option out there

42:33.440 --> 42:38.600
for you. The other thing which is interesting is there's a company working on mod chips

42:38.600 --> 42:41.720
right now they're supposed to be released in a few weeks here for the PSP

42:41.720 --> 42:45.320
the first and they're going to be sold on eBay starting off in the price on

42:45.320 --> 42:49.320
those supposed to be about 25 bucks so that would be interesting to check out

42:49.320 --> 42:54.960
and supposedly it will allow homebrew that we run on any version of the PSP

42:54.960 --> 42:59.320
now on the same note as homebrew running on any version PSP there's this brand

42:59.320 --> 43:04.920
new software coming out called PSP advanced and it's basically a video

43:04.920 --> 43:10.800
software, kind of very similar to iTunes where you can play any, most video formats and most

43:10.800 --> 43:11.800
audio formats.

43:11.800 --> 43:17.760
The thing that's interesting about this though is it's going to run on any version firmware

43:17.760 --> 43:21.880
and they're saying that it might be on a UMD or something like that, but there's also a

43:21.880 --> 43:23.280
part that's on your memory stick.

43:23.280 --> 43:28.340
Yeah, that's going to be exploited to run any homebrew, that's what's going to happen.

43:28.340 --> 43:34.560
So pretty soon, firmware might not be an issue anymore of running home, Bruce.

43:34.560 --> 43:35.560
Very interesting.

43:35.560 --> 43:37.580
Very interesting.

43:37.580 --> 43:40.700
Usually throughout the Orange Launch Radio To Go show, we would open up the mailbag and

43:40.700 --> 43:42.060
go to what you guys have to say.

43:42.060 --> 43:46.100
Unfortunately, our internet in the studio is down right now, so we're unable to access

43:46.100 --> 43:47.100
our mailbag.

43:47.100 --> 43:48.100
Isn't that convenient?

43:48.100 --> 43:49.540
So we're going to have to table that to next week.

43:49.540 --> 43:55.040
However, if you have some emails you want to send us, togo, T-O-G-O, at orangelaunchradio.com

43:55.040 --> 43:58.880
is the address you want to use and we definitely always like to hear what you guys have to

43:58.880 --> 44:01.440
say and Dark Sakura is always in there looking at the email back.

44:01.440 --> 44:05.280
I've actually started helping her out recently too so I go in there sometimes as well because

44:05.280 --> 44:08.560
there's just so many of you guys with so many nice things to say so keep them coming.

44:08.560 --> 44:09.560
We like getting emails.

44:09.560 --> 44:10.560
Doesn't everybody?

44:10.560 --> 44:14.000
So we usually try to send one back because we know people like getting emails.

44:14.000 --> 44:16.600
All right, what else you got, Loki?

44:16.600 --> 44:23.040
Well, the other things I was going to talk about, more of kind of the rumor control stuff.

44:23.040 --> 44:28.320
Someone was saying, or actually they were rumored to have a, that Microsoft was thinking

44:28.320 --> 44:34.420
about doing an Xbox portable, I don't think that's going to happen anytime soon.

44:34.420 --> 44:44.180
So anyways, beyond that, this kind of ties in with some portable stuff, it's really interesting.

44:44.180 --> 44:53.620
There's this UK site, Britishgaming.co.uk, they posted an article about a Resident Evil

44:53.620 --> 44:54.620
game.

44:54.620 --> 45:01.520
It's basically an online game that's made to look like one of those old Game & Watch

45:01.520 --> 45:03.640
games, which is kind of interesting.

45:03.640 --> 45:09.940
With the little LCD games, or whatever, the burn-in pictures, okay.

45:09.940 --> 45:15.580
And supposedly it's a mini-game promotion where you control Leon and you try to knife

45:15.580 --> 45:24.020
50 or more chainsaw-wielding maniacs, which look like little heads with a stick.

45:24.020 --> 45:25.380
So it's kind of interesting.

45:25.380 --> 45:28.540
You can find that at BritishGaming.co.uk.

45:28.540 --> 45:31.260
Will it have the same bad voice acting as the first game had?

45:31.260 --> 45:33.020
I don't know about that, but...

45:33.020 --> 45:36.060
It sounds like it's based off RE4, so I guess not.

45:36.060 --> 45:38.420
Yeah, probably not.

45:38.420 --> 45:44.940
The other things, there's been tons of pictures, especially with the Xbox lounge in Japan,

45:44.940 --> 45:48.220
of new face plates coming out for the 360.

45:48.220 --> 45:52.300
I'm going to be the first to say that face plates for the 360 is the most retarded idea

45:52.300 --> 45:54.660
I've ever seen.

45:54.660 --> 45:59.900
I don't get it myself, but at the same time, well the Game Boy Micro, I don't really get

45:59.900 --> 46:02.020
that either with the whole face plate customization.

46:02.020 --> 46:06.220
It seems to be this interesting trend, but okay, whatever, it may not be for me, but

46:06.220 --> 46:09.980
some people are into this whole customize, you know if people customize their car, they

46:09.980 --> 46:10.980
might want to customize their console.

46:10.980 --> 46:11.980
Exactly.

46:11.980 --> 46:12.980
I don't know.

46:12.980 --> 46:17.540
Well, if you're into faceplates, you can definitely pick some up for your most, you know, consumer

46:17.540 --> 46:18.540
hoarded products.

46:18.540 --> 46:22.180
For example, Star Wars Episode III, they've got three different faceplates that will be

46:22.180 --> 46:23.180
available.

46:23.180 --> 46:24.180
These are official.

46:24.180 --> 46:28.740
These are official, and they're, like most faceplates, they're going to be about fourteen

46:28.740 --> 46:29.740
nights.

46:29.740 --> 46:32.900
But all that, see, I don't know if I dig those, because the only one that's kind of cool is

46:32.900 --> 46:37.180
that first one in the picture where it's them dueling in the lava from episode 3, but the

46:37.180 --> 46:42.060
other ones, like the one that looks inspired by the classic Star Wars films, all the controller

46:42.060 --> 46:46.040
ports and stuff are running through the people's faces, so you can't even really see clearly

46:46.040 --> 46:46.960
what it is.

46:46.960 --> 46:51.260
You're like, I think, is black rain coming down on the Star Wars cast?

46:51.260 --> 46:52.580
Because it's hard to see.

46:52.580 --> 46:53.580
I don't know.

46:53.580 --> 46:54.580
Whatever.

46:54.580 --> 47:01.460
So they have World of Worlds themed stuff, Adidas, MTV's G-Spot, just a bunch of weird

47:01.460 --> 47:02.460
shit.

47:02.460 --> 47:06.580
That's all going to be available at some point. I'm sure you'll see these in your

47:06.580 --> 47:09.900
major retail stores. I think I'll stick with the standard white

47:09.900 --> 47:14.260
faceplate. No, I like the idea of faceplates, like they showed a Project Off from Racing 3 one.

47:14.260 --> 47:18.140
Maybe included with like a special edition of the game. That might be something cool to

47:18.140 --> 47:19.220
give away, but

47:19.220 --> 47:23.140
I'm not going to spend $15 to buy something when, especially

47:23.140 --> 47:26.660
if I'm going to buy a faceplate, it's going to be a blank one that I can design myself.

47:26.660 --> 47:30.060
And you know there's going to be a website. You know there's a Star Wars nut out there that can't wait to

47:30.060 --> 47:31.060
spend the $15 on this.

47:31.060 --> 47:35.700
Well, these are the same people who buy those Star Wars themed Alienware PCs because they

47:35.700 --> 47:39.300
have the Star Wars stuff on the side.

47:39.300 --> 47:42.820
Anyways, moving on from there.

47:42.820 --> 47:51.220
The other thing is this week actually, Newsweek interviewed Miyamoto talking about what we

47:51.220 --> 47:56.180
can look forward to seeing in the revolution and where he sees gaming kind of going from

47:56.180 --> 47:57.180
there.

47:57.180 --> 48:04.420
Both comments that he made though was saying that he always envisioned that the console

48:04.420 --> 48:11.180
games would break out of the on a screen type of thing and basically fill up an entire room.

48:11.180 --> 48:14.900
You made a very interesting blog post about this, so you kind of came to a conclusion

48:14.900 --> 48:15.900
from this, huh?

48:15.900 --> 48:18.880
Well, I'm not the only one that's come to this conclusion.

48:18.880 --> 48:26.020
It's basically that one of the things was that Show West this year, they were showing

48:26.020 --> 48:27.940
off the brand new 3D technology.

48:27.940 --> 48:30.500
Which is a movie convention, not a game convention, a movie house convention.

48:30.500 --> 48:31.500
Movie house convention.

48:31.500 --> 48:34.900
It's going to be, they're pushing, this is going to be the next format of theaters.

48:34.900 --> 48:37.020
This is what's going to drive people back into theaters.

48:37.020 --> 48:40.900
It's going to be these stereoscopic 3D movies.

48:40.900 --> 48:43.180
Everything you see is going to be 3D.

48:43.180 --> 48:48.700
Well, Robert Rodriguez and Peter Jackson, all of them, were saying, I believe it was

48:48.700 --> 48:53.120
Robert Rodriguez that commented saying that you're going to be seeing these in the theaters

48:53.120 --> 48:58.760
the next coming years, but one game company has beat us to it, to the market, but you

48:58.760 --> 49:02.360
know, you're going to see these things rolling out of the theaters soon.

49:02.360 --> 49:07.920
Well from what I can tell so far, Xbox obviously is not going to have anything for it, Sony

49:07.920 --> 49:11.900
doesn't have anything for it, they've also demoed something on the GameCube that was

49:11.900 --> 49:18.520
at E3 a couple years ago showing a stereoscopic 3D plug-in for it, what do you think is going

49:18.520 --> 49:19.520
to be?

49:19.520 --> 49:24.320
So that combined with Miyamoto's comment about, you know, off the screen.

49:24.320 --> 49:29.320
And he says that he wants it to basically take up the entire room.

49:29.320 --> 49:33.500
And you think about that controller, which is a very 3D controller, and he said, this

49:33.500 --> 49:38.280
is all I can say about this at this time.

49:38.280 --> 49:41.980
To me, I think one of these things that they're going to announce, and I honestly think that

49:41.980 --> 49:45.360
everything about the revolution hasn't been said yet, I know that they've got stuff up

49:45.360 --> 49:49.220
their sleeves that they haven't said yet because everyone's really excited about it.

49:49.220 --> 49:54.320
I think that stereoscopic 3D as you know a standard for the system I think is going to

49:54.320 --> 49:55.320
be possible.

49:55.320 --> 49:59.540
Now one of the things that they threw out someone was suggesting was a portable projection

49:59.540 --> 50:04.220
screen that would do stereoscopic 3D without glasses which I don't know if that can be

50:04.220 --> 50:05.860
pulled off.

50:05.860 --> 50:11.540
As long as it's not something that's hoarded in all the games because that can make you

50:11.540 --> 50:14.340
very sick from doing something like that for too long.

50:14.340 --> 50:17.740
It's got to be something that's only once in a while you know.

50:17.740 --> 50:20.820
I don't know, like minigames or something, because I don't know, I would think that that

50:20.820 --> 50:27.420
would make you sick, unless they found a way for the body to get adjusted to the 3D more.

50:27.420 --> 50:31.680
But again, I guess if I had the time to sit through Captain EO when I was a kid, which

50:31.680 --> 50:34.460
is similar in a way, I would have the time for a game.

50:34.460 --> 50:38.940
But I think though, I mean, Nintendo's known for gimmicky stuff, now granted this is not

50:38.940 --> 50:43.180
really gimmicky, this is like the next stage in what, you know, cinema and stuff is going

50:43.180 --> 50:45.100
to happen, and you know...

50:45.100 --> 50:47.100
One step closer to a holodeck, really.

50:47.100 --> 50:54.100
seriously and I would think a 3D mouse or a 3D controller like that, it makes sense.

50:54.660 --> 50:58.280
It's just, you know, I'd be really surprised if they didn't do this and this really is

50:58.280 --> 51:01.480
making sense that this is the direction it's going to go and I think we're going to find

51:01.480 --> 51:05.680
out more once they've come up with these press conferences talking about it because this

51:05.680 --> 51:10.680
right here, once the Playstation 3 comes out and all that stuff, this is really going to

51:10.680 --> 51:15.640
set them apart. Whether their specs may not be as powerful as the other systems, it's

51:15.640 --> 51:19.780
It's not going to matter anymore, they're going to be in their own category, they're

51:19.780 --> 51:21.960
just going to be set apart from everybody else.

51:21.960 --> 51:24.440
Which would be revolutionary.

51:24.440 --> 51:30.120
And I think it would put them back on, you know, in the lead basically.

51:30.120 --> 51:33.200
Interesting theories, we'll see if any of them come true.

51:33.200 --> 51:35.000
Anything else for us tonight, Loki?

51:35.000 --> 51:39.540
Well that's pretty much, you know, what I've got is all the important stuff I hit up on.

51:39.540 --> 51:45.520
This month is going to be really crazy as far as games coming out, it's really a doozy.

51:45.520 --> 51:51.240
Especially with next week, the week of the 14th, there's way too much stuff coming out,

51:51.240 --> 51:55.760
way too much stuff, and then you've got the 360 launch, it's got to be a busy month.

51:55.760 --> 52:00.480
Well, it's that time of year when we're getting into Christmas and stuff, so not a surprise.

52:00.480 --> 52:06.400
Oh, and the other thing is Advent Children, it's supposed to be on the 10th, date's still

52:06.400 --> 52:10.760
to be announced now, again, that thing keeps getting pushed back further and further.

52:10.760 --> 52:14.360
Because they have to think of a way to get people to buy the UMD or DVD now because everybody's

52:14.360 --> 52:18.600
pirated it off the internet not everybody but you know they definitely

52:18.600 --> 52:22.160
took a hit by that getting leaked out and everything so they need of course

52:22.160 --> 52:24.960
they shouldn't have released it in one place way before they released it in

52:24.960 --> 52:29.200
another I don't know maybe that's just me anyway I'm just a couple more stories

52:29.200 --> 52:32.880
for you guys tonight I want to talk about Metal Gear acid 2 now you know in

52:32.880 --> 52:36.800
the previous Metal Gear games there's usually been some type of like fan based

52:36.800 --> 52:41.480
competition for instance you could be a dog tag in Metal Gear Solid 2 or there

52:41.480 --> 52:45.520
was like a camouflage design competition that they did for Metal Gear Solid 3, well now

52:45.520 --> 52:50.520
what they're doing is a card creation competition for Metal Gear Acid 2. So if you think you

52:50.520 --> 52:57.880
have a name for a card, an image file, a card type and card information, and something that

52:57.880 --> 53:02.460
goes around the Metal Gear and Kojima theme, now it can't be a crossover, like you can't

53:02.460 --> 53:07.580
have a DDR card or something from another Konami game, no Goemon or anything. And it

53:07.580 --> 53:12.100
has to be something realistic that would actually work in the game.

53:12.100 --> 53:15.460
Check out some of the various gaming websites, because they're running competitions.

53:15.460 --> 53:20.760
Also check out Konami's site to design cards for Metal Gear Acid 2, and some of them are

53:20.760 --> 53:25.300
going to turn up in the final game, so those of you creative folks might want to go check

53:25.300 --> 53:26.300
that out.

53:26.300 --> 53:27.300
That is pretty awesome.

53:27.300 --> 53:31.660
I'm also glad to see that they're actually going to be bringing a Metal Gear Solid type

53:31.660 --> 53:33.300
game to the PSP.

53:33.300 --> 53:37.340
It's not going to be just the smell of your acid anymore, which is nice.

53:37.340 --> 53:41.180
Alright, now last story for you guys tonight.

53:41.180 --> 53:42.180
This is kind of interesting.

53:42.180 --> 53:45.460
Usually we end with a funny story, but this is not a funny story.

53:45.460 --> 53:50.080
This is just kind of one of those gaming culture stories.

53:50.080 --> 53:55.040
There was actually in China, this is something that was being reported on Yahoo News China,

53:55.040 --> 53:58.980
there was a character in World of Warcraft, well not really a character because it was

53:58.980 --> 54:01.020
a human that was playing this of course.

54:01.020 --> 54:05.820
name of the character was Snowly. This person died after playing World of

54:05.820 --> 54:09.760
Warcraft for several days straight during a national holiday. Well, they had

54:09.760 --> 54:16.620
an online funeral service to basically commemorate the week anniversary of this

54:16.620 --> 54:21.840
person passing away and what's very interesting is if you look at the screen

54:21.840 --> 54:27.140
capture it's very solemn. It just shows all these characters kind of sitting and

54:27.140 --> 54:29.940
it kind of looks like they're all bowing their heads and they're all in these

54:29.940 --> 54:36.600
very neat lines so it's kind of I don't know it's very sad to see so but it was

54:36.600 --> 54:41.220
it's just very interesting to see the community coming together like that to

54:41.220 --> 54:45.820
honor somebody who is playing among them but it also just goes to show please

54:45.820 --> 54:51.100
please game in moderation especially with these MMOs you know play for an

54:51.100 --> 54:56.220
hour but then take a good 10-minute break go outside get some air lift some

54:56.220 --> 55:01.760
weights, do something. It doesn't always have to be 100% about the games. It can

55:01.760 --> 55:07.260
be 90% about the games, you know. And finally, where would we be in a

55:07.260 --> 55:12.660
podcast without mentioning Jack Thompson? Oh, just when I thought it was over.

55:12.660 --> 55:18.880
Okay, so what's going on is there's a homicide case that's actually, you know,

55:18.880 --> 55:22.060
of course with a kid and, you know, they're using the Grand Theft Auto as

55:22.060 --> 55:23.820
saying that's the thing.

55:23.820 --> 55:26.980
Well, one of the parts that the defense has actually

55:26.980 --> 55:30.300
kind of turned the tables on is they're

55:30.300 --> 55:32.940
questioning Jack Thompson's ability

55:32.940 --> 55:34.780
to practice law in this state.

55:34.780 --> 55:37.820
And they're actually questioning his character now.

55:37.820 --> 55:39.620
And so Jack Thompson's, in a sense,

55:39.620 --> 55:42.500
going to be put on trial, which should be interesting.

55:42.500 --> 55:44.500
They're actually going to try to get him barred.

55:44.500 --> 55:48.660
I think it's from, I want to say it's from Georgia,

55:48.660 --> 55:51.060
from practicing law in Georgia.

55:51.060 --> 55:58.180
I know this is really sophomoric, but only one word comes to mind right now.

55:58.180 --> 56:05.660
So it's interesting, but sooner or later they're going to find out this guy's a quack.

56:05.660 --> 56:08.740
All right, that's going to do it for another edition of Orange Lounge Radio To Go.

56:08.740 --> 56:12.200
Check out our website, by the way, www.orangeloungeradio.com.

56:12.200 --> 56:15.100
We look forward to seeing what you guys have to say on the forums.

56:15.100 --> 56:18.900
And also, our forums did this this week, which I think is very interesting.

56:18.900 --> 56:22.500
We're trying to put together this map to see where all the Orange Lounge radio listeners

56:22.500 --> 56:23.500
live.

56:23.500 --> 56:24.500
It's a frapper map.

56:24.500 --> 56:25.500
So check that out.

56:25.500 --> 56:26.500
That's on our forums.

56:26.500 --> 56:28.500
It's F-R-A-P-P-E-R, I think.

56:28.500 --> 56:30.260
I can't tell because our internet is down right now.

56:30.260 --> 56:31.260
It's recording.

56:31.260 --> 56:32.260
Yeah.

56:32.260 --> 56:33.820
So check that out or on our forums.

56:33.820 --> 56:35.140
Of course, the link is there.

56:35.140 --> 56:41.300
So check that out and plot yourself on the map and show us what regional areas we should

56:41.300 --> 56:42.300
be covering more.

56:42.300 --> 56:47.260
And also this week, I believe, Jamie's going to the podcast awards.

56:47.260 --> 56:48.260
Yes.

56:48.260 --> 56:51.020
that a little early in the show she won't be here next week because the

56:51.020 --> 56:57.860
podcast awards but she'll be having fun I'm very envious oh well but you know

56:57.860 --> 57:02.340
thanks to everybody out there who you know voted for us and then loved us it

57:02.340 --> 57:07.180
was nice yeah that's it final thoughts Loki we're gonna be on the news on

57:07.180 --> 57:11.080
Tuesday and I hope that we you are I'm gonna be on the news on Tuesday I hope

57:11.080 --> 57:15.740
they don't catch me saying something retarded and I know I know that they've

57:15.740 --> 57:20.700
got me saying something stupid like it's so much fun or it's I know I know you're

57:20.700 --> 57:25.980

check that there's more on the forums on that if you're curious about what's

57:28.860 --> 57:33.660
going on with all that Loki and Dark Sakura being on the local news my final

57:33.660 --> 57:38.700
thought is I need zinc and vitamin C because I think I'm coming down with a

57:38.700 --> 57:43.860
cold and it's time to end this show because it's just making me sicker I get

57:43.860 --> 57:48.940
to be sick. Thank you guys very much for listening and supporting Orange Lounge Radio. We appreciate

57:48.940 --> 57:52.300

57:58.580 --> 58:05.580
