38
00:07:07,180 --> 00:07:08,180
My name is Rob Roberts.

39
00:07:08,180 --> 00:07:09,340
You might know me as Sky.

40
00:07:09,340 --> 00:07:11,740
Joining me, as always, are my awesome co-hosts.

41
00:07:11,740 --> 00:07:15,780
In this corner, the happiest bunny on the farm, Miss Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers.

42
00:07:15,780 --> 00:07:16,780
Yo.

43
00:07:16,780 --> 00:07:18,780
How you doing?

44
00:07:18,780 --> 00:07:22,060
This microphone is heavy.

45
00:07:22,060 --> 00:07:24,220
I also drink the blood of young virgins.

46
00:07:24,220 --> 00:07:25,220
Hot.

47
00:07:25,220 --> 00:07:27,060
I'm having it for dinner right now.

48
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:29,060
It is salad dressing.

49
00:07:29,060 --> 00:07:35,060
I think that's what I think that they use in their salad dressings at McDonald's. It has to be something that tastes fairly...

50
00:07:35,060 --> 00:07:39,060
We may have to switch mics, because for some reason that one's not picking you up so well.

51
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:41,060
LA!

52
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:45,060
Let's do this. Just make sure when you're talking, the little switch is out this way, otherwise it won't pick you up.

53
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:50,060
This is my microphone.

54
00:07:50,060 --> 00:07:52,060
I know, but I switched it because we had trouble...

55
00:07:52,060 --> 00:07:56,060
Don't change things on me! It makes me anxious!

56
00:07:56,060 --> 00:07:58,660
And when I get anxious, people die!

57
00:07:58,660 --> 00:08:00,260
They're all gonna get you.

58
00:08:00,260 --> 00:08:02,660
Mmmmmm, salad.

59
00:08:02,660 --> 00:08:06,460
Something's weird with this microphone. Like, it is really quiet. I don't know.

60
00:08:06,460 --> 00:08:08,060
Everything's breaking!

61
00:08:08,060 --> 00:08:09,860
I blame the powers of darkness.

62
00:08:09,860 --> 00:08:12,660
Oh, here we go. Here we go. A little better.

63
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:13,860
Yes, Blame Jack Thompson.

64
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:15,460
Here on Orange Lounge Radio.

65
00:08:15,460 --> 00:08:16,260
Blame Jack Thompson.

66
00:08:16,260 --> 00:08:21,060
It is Jack Thompson. He's trying to sabotage us because we speak the truth.

67
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:24,500
Alright also joining us on tonight's program say hello to the one and only Loki

68
00:08:27,260 --> 00:08:32,100
Huh, oh hi Loki, thank you for joining our program tonight. We appreciate it

69
00:08:32,900 --> 00:08:36,980
Thank you. Glad to be here fucking RRC work

70
00:08:39,540 --> 00:08:44,240
Something is wrong with my microphone like I'm not as loud as I usually am thank God

71
00:08:45,220 --> 00:08:48,380
Check check check check there. We go there. We go now. I can hear myself

72
00:08:48,380 --> 00:08:49,380
So?

73
00:08:49,380 --> 00:08:50,380
Oh, darn!

74
00:08:50,380 --> 00:08:51,380
This internet sucks.

75
00:08:51,380 --> 00:08:52,380
It really does.

76
00:08:52,380 --> 00:08:53,380
All right.

77
00:08:53,380 --> 00:08:57,660
Anyway, now that we've got our sound issues worked out, we can actually have ourselves

78
00:08:57,660 --> 00:08:59,300
a little bit of a show tonight.

79
00:08:59,300 --> 00:09:04,180
I know I want to talk a lot about Guitar Hero, because it's really cool.

80
00:09:04,180 --> 00:09:07,020
And we're also going to talk about, of course, our weeks and our day.

81
00:09:07,020 --> 00:09:11,900
We're going to talk about a cool interview that we're going to have on tonight's podcast.

82
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:14,780
And then we're going to talk about whatever tickles our fancy.

83
00:09:14,780 --> 00:09:16,820
And then we're going to set a guitar on fire.

84
00:09:16,820 --> 00:09:17,820
We just might.

85
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:21,820
So first, say hello to our special guest, because it wouldn't be a show if we didn't have some special guests.

86
00:09:21,820 --> 00:09:23,820
Say hello to Bugd.

87
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:25,820
Hello to Bugd.

88
00:09:25,820 --> 00:09:27,820
And also say hello to DDR Angel.

89
00:09:27,820 --> 00:09:30,820
Hello. My salad just exploded.

90
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:32,820
That sounds hot.

91
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:35,820
You don't want to know.

92
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:39,820
All right, and Extifer is around as well.

93
00:09:39,820 --> 00:09:42,820
He might pop in a little later in the show, hopefully to give him some movie review.

94
00:09:42,820 --> 00:09:43,820
He's smuggling his new Mac.

95
00:09:43,820 --> 00:09:46,820
Yes, he's making sweet love to his new Macintosh.

96

00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:05,820
I figured we could maybe continue the theme of the pre-show tonight,

101
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:08,820
because the pre-show tonight was a lot of disco music.

102
00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:10,820

125
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:29,560
And there's bright lights starring no coke flow

126
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:30,060
So what?

127
00:12:30,060 --> 00:12:32,060
A kung fu fighter in a disco

128
00:12:32,060 --> 00:12:34,560
He's out to take his chance, he knows the honey's in the house

129
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:36,560
Only coke for romance

130
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:40,560
He's got a white suit on, five past one and the night has just begun

131
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:42,560
It's when he lays it on with the style

132
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:44,560
A lady's mad with a nice smile

133
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:46,560
And right before his eyes

134
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:48,560
He sees a pretty old thing looking real fly

135
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:52,560
He wants to make the score, so he takes the hand and leads her to the dance floor.

136
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:54,560
He's leaving her line after line.

137
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:56,560
She tells him that he looks real fine.

138
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:58,560
He gives the man perfect timing.

139
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:00,560
He's right when he's combo fighting.

140
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:05,560
Come on, come on.

141
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:07,560

So far that I'm falling in love, falling in love

166
00:15:24,940 --> 00:15:27,380
The sections on the top keep moving, moving

167

177
00:15:55,300 --> 00:15:57,300
I just love the music

178
00:15:59,300 --> 00:16:02,300
Don't stop the music, don't stop the music The keys, they'll go away

179
00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:28,300
Hello? Hello is this thing on? Testing. Testing one, two.

180
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:32,300
I'm looking in the index, but I don't see anything on how to run a radio show.

181
00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:36,300
Hello? I don't understand this. Does this thing work?

182
00:16:36,300 --> 00:16:38,300
This thing reads like stereo instructions.

183
00:16:38,300 --> 00:16:39,300
Is this on?

184
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:40,300
What the hell?

185
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:45,300
Orange Lounge Radio. Broke-down ghetto Pamani radio.

186
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:47,300
What the f***?

187
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:49,300
Hi, kids. We're back here on Orange Lounge Radio.

188
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:52,300
And I know we've been having some mic problems tonight or something,

189
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:54,300
so we tried fixing it a little bit during the break,

190
00:16:54,300 --> 00:16:57,300
so I hope that our mic quality is a little better now.

191
00:16:57,300 --> 00:17:00,960
now but if not you'll just have to deal with it I guess well I don't know we

192
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:04,320
tried to patch some things up and we checked Mike out and replaced him yeah

193
00:17:04,320 --> 00:17:08,460
that's right we fired so hopefully things are a little bit a little better

194
00:17:08,460 --> 00:17:13,860
now anyway those responsible have just been sacked yes and those are the

195
00:17:13,860 --> 00:17:18,820
sacking is have also been signed at Infinium assembly a giant foot comes

196
00:17:18,820 --> 00:17:22,180
crashing down on our program will now continue the rest of this program in the

197
00:17:22,180 --> 00:17:29,660
That's why they haven't kicked us out, right?

198
00:17:29,660 --> 00:17:30,660
Yeah.

199
00:17:30,660 --> 00:17:34,020
Moving on, I want to get into this real quickly, because we were talking about this a little

200
00:17:34,020 --> 00:17:36,380
bit during the break, before we get into a little bit of How's Your Week, How's Your

201
00:17:36,380 --> 00:17:37,380
Day.

202
00:17:37,380 --> 00:17:39,820
But Loki's randomly surfing the internet, as he does when he's on this program, because

203
00:17:39,820 --> 00:17:42,060
he doesn't really like to participate in the program.

204
00:17:42,060 --> 00:17:45,340
He just surfs the internet randomly and giggles once in a while in the corner.

205
00:17:45,340 --> 00:17:49,180
So Loki, what was this article you found about the AOL guy?

206
00:17:49,180 --> 00:17:50,660
You found an article about the AOL guy?

207
00:17:50,660 --> 00:18:00,660
The AOL guy is basically selling himself to make custom WAV files for your email programs or what have you.

208
00:18:00,660 --> 00:18:08,660
And he's charging, I believe, $12 per WAV file or something like that.

209
00:18:08,660 --> 00:18:13,660
He's already sold himself to the devil. He may as well sell himself to everybody else.

210
00:18:13,660 --> 00:18:16,660
Can you get him to say anything?

211
00:18:16,660 --> 00:18:18,660
Well, I have no idea.

212
00:18:18,660 --> 00:18:25,140
make him record a WAV file and send it to my ex that goes, you've got herpes.

213
00:18:25,140 --> 00:18:32,380
It says, let's see here, yeah, one WAV file, it would be $12 for a non-AOL file, $30 for

214
00:18:32,380 --> 00:18:40,720
five files, so that's a little break there. It says basically, it doesn't really say what

215
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:45,300
else he'll do, just pretty much whatever, I guess, you want.

216
00:18:45,300 --> 00:18:50,300
Is there a limit to the number of words he'll say?

217
00:18:50,300 --> 00:18:53,300
I don't know. It doesn't say.

218
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:57,300
I wonder if I'm singing I'm a little teapot.

219
00:18:57,300 --> 00:19:02,300
I'm a little teapot. Short hand stout.

220
00:19:02,300 --> 00:19:07,300
You've got mail. You've got hot tea.

221
00:19:07,300 --> 00:19:12,300
I think he'll do you've got mail and stuff.

222
00:19:12,300 --> 00:19:18,820
you've got mail Bob or you've got mail you got served nobody graces to give him

223
00:19:18,820 --> 00:19:28,180
like a name that has no vowels and it just like all consonants you can

224
00:19:28,180 --> 00:19:33,380
technically get away with that if you used a lie that's true no but just like

225
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:37,700
some made-up thing is like my name is you just hit a bunch of keys you know

226
00:19:37,700 --> 00:19:39,640
known

227
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:43,100
exerts the access to con or something you just make it up and like when he

228
00:19:43,100 --> 00:19:48,340
doesn't say it right now no you bastard that's my name emphasis on the x

229
00:19:48,340 --> 00:19:50,580
some ancient egyptian name

230
00:19:50,580 --> 00:19:52,900
or like uh... my

231
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:53,820
awesome

232
00:19:53,820 --> 00:19:58,520
so yeah they can pronounce something in a while she'll totally screw it up

233
00:19:58,520 --> 00:20:03,220
in a foreign language can you imagine what it must be like as him you

234
00:20:03,220 --> 00:20:04,620
know it's just

235
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:10,100
It's just really bad stuff, I mean, you know, he's all makin' love to his wife, oh yeah,

236
00:20:10,100 --> 00:20:13,260
you know, just really weird, he's got a weird voice.

237
00:20:13,260 --> 00:20:16,380
Dang it, I only get hot when you say it!

238
00:20:16,380 --> 00:20:17,380
You've got male.

239
00:20:17,380 --> 00:20:18,380
Oh, baby!

240
00:20:18,380 --> 00:20:24,700
It's like, remember, um, it was Carlos, not Carlos Menzies, but, uh, Paulo Francisco and

241
00:20:24,700 --> 00:20:28,660
the movie guy, and the movie voice guy, and him, you know, making love to himself.

242
00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:30,660
Oh, yeah, I think that's an old, yeah.

243
00:20:30,660 --> 00:20:31,660
A passion.

244
00:20:31,660 --> 00:20:32,660
Anyways.

245
00:20:32,660 --> 00:20:36,540
Alright, anyway, we're gonna start off tonight's program as we always start off every week's

246
00:20:36,540 --> 00:20:39,140
show with playing a little bit of How Was Your Week, How Was Your Day, and this is the

247
00:20:39,140 --> 00:20:43,740
part where we find out, in the hosts' lives, how was that week, or day.

248
00:20:43,740 --> 00:20:45,740
Talk, Sakura?

249
00:20:45,740 --> 00:20:50,820
My week was crap in a basket.

250
00:20:50,820 --> 00:20:55,540
I'm not even a well-put-together basket, it was sort of like a mildewed basket like you

251
00:20:55,540 --> 00:20:57,540
find in the thrift store.

252
00:20:57,540 --> 00:20:58,540
Eww.

253
00:20:58,540 --> 00:20:59,540
Yeah.

254
00:20:59,540 --> 00:21:07,420
I went to the doctor Tuesday with a migraine, and so now I found out that my brain might

255
00:21:07,420 --> 00:21:08,420
be broken.

256
00:21:08,420 --> 00:21:11,980
So I get to go in for a CT scan on Monday.

257
00:21:11,980 --> 00:21:13,620
Fine, huh?

258
00:21:13,620 --> 00:21:20,420
I don't want to make a joke, but I have to say this.

259
00:21:20,420 --> 00:21:21,420
It's not the tumor.

260
00:21:21,420 --> 00:21:22,420
I eat fat in the car.

261
00:21:22,420 --> 00:21:29,420
The only time my headache wasn't present was when I was really drunk.

262
00:21:29,420 --> 00:21:33,420
I don't want to come across as insensitive to the listeners, so...

263
00:21:33,420 --> 00:21:39,420
I have the diagnosis. You're allergic to sobriety.

264
00:21:39,420 --> 00:21:42,420
That's probably it.

265
00:21:42,420 --> 00:21:46,420
I know, I'm so smart. That'll be $50, please.

266
00:21:46,420 --> 00:21:48,420
Guess what? Bite me.

267
00:21:48,420 --> 00:21:52,420
Better insurance.

268
00:21:52,420 --> 00:21:56,420
I'll tell you, Bill, that I can't sit on the air.

269
00:21:56,420 --> 00:22:03,340
All right, so I'd like to talk here and lots of it you're gonna have to drink the thing that tastes like chalk and I

270
00:22:03,860 --> 00:22:09,320
Don't know no because they're testing my brain. I'm sure it'll be fine. You'll be fine

271
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:15,320
I have a headache right now, too. I have the same headache that I have had since Friday the week before

272
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:20,940
So I'm not very happy and they put me on stuff for migraines

273
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:25,940
They should put a couple pills underneath her head so Neil. This is your brain

274
00:22:25,940 --> 00:22:34,060
brain, this is your brain on drugs. This doesn't even make sense. Her brain is on drugs, therefore

275
00:22:34,060 --> 00:22:37,780
when she's getting whatever, you know, a CAT scan or whatever. Oh, okay, I got it, with

276
00:22:37,780 --> 00:22:44,980
the egg, okay. I have a magnet that says, this is your brain, and then this is your

277
00:22:44,980 --> 00:22:53,660
brain with a piece of toast and bacon. I haven't gotten, you know, a little known fact, I actually

278
00:22:53,660 --> 00:22:57,600
collect fridge magnets I like to put them all over my fridge because they're

279
00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:00,760
awesome but not the poetry magnets those don't count because you know getting

280
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:04,600
like 200 magnets with random words on them that's cheating so I like the real

281
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:08,960
magnets and I haven't gotten a new one in a long time you know one of my

282
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:12,480
favorite stores in the world I know there's one of them on Pier 39 in San

283
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:15,360
Francisco is the the magnet town I don't even know what the hell the name of it

284
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:18,200
is something like I'm sure one of our San Francisco listeners is gonna correct

285
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:24,600
me but like magnet place or something I love that store it's awesome magnets are

286
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:31,120
cool bumper stickers of my back to my broken brain oh sorry I think that our

287
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:34,940
listeners are probably very amused if I found out what I was actually on they

288
00:23:34,940 --> 00:23:39,280
keep saying Vicodin I'm not on Vicodin I'm on something else that I'm not gonna

289
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:43,920
tell you what I'm on but they would laugh because it's the last thing anyone

290
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:49,760
ever expected me to be taken like pros actually ish I don't know I don't know

291
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:56,160
it's actually called a triple whiskey shot awesome at least I wish that they

292
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:59,320
have triple whiskey shots in the pill so you don't get the burn you just take the

293
00:23:59,320 --> 00:24:05,120
whiskey pill okay well I hope I hope you go to the doctor and and everything is

294
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:08,960
is okay and they just find that they need to let the hamster out or something

295
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:09,960
I don't know.

296
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:12,960
Dude, if they gave me morphine, I'd be freaking happy.

297
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:15,960
Alright, anything else you want to share about your week and your day?

298
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:17,960
Um, I need a new job.

299
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:18,960
Okay.

300
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:20,960
Now hiring.

301
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:22,960
Uh, Loki, how was your week?

302
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:23,960
How was your day?

303
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:26,960
My week was pretty good.

304
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:36,960
Um, the entire week was basically filled with, um, work and plain death matches in, uh, Grand Theft Auto Liberty City Stories

305
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:42,960
because my boss loves Grand Theft Auto, and so now instead of taking a 15 minute break

306
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:48,200
and playing something, we go down into the theater and play four player multiplayer deathmatch

307
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:53,240
on Grand Theft Auto Liberty City Stories and take a half an hour break. And it's okay because

308
00:24:53,240 --> 00:25:02,800
the boss is there too, so hell yeah. Do that twice a day. So, that was pretty fun. As promised,

309
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:09,080
I have made sure to, um, you know, participate in the Biggest Loser thing, and I'm happy

310
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:19,080
to say that I have eaten fast food every single day this week to meet my quota, and, um, yeah,

311
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:21,420
other than that, really, um, not too much else.

312
00:25:21,420 --> 00:25:23,360
You've got heart problems!

313
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:30,680
I'm fine. Shit. Um, I went and saw Saw II last night. I have to say, though, I was quite

314
00:25:30,680 --> 00:25:33,680
It wasn't as gory as I thought it would be.

315
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:35,680
It really was a letdown.

316
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:41,680
I mean, I don't know what everyone was saying. I was expecting, like, you know, fountains of blood.

317
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:47,680
There is not even nearly enough blood in that, or gore, or anything.

318
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:51,680
So, they really are going to have to impress me with a Saw III.

319
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:53,680
And you know there's going to be a Saw III.

320
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:55,680
Oh, yeah. Stupid bitch.

321
00:25:55,680 --> 00:26:03,180
They shouldn't have given the main guy cancer, or it should have been cancer that doesn't progress that fast or something like that, you know, magic cancer or something.

322
00:26:03,180 --> 00:26:07,680
I don't know. Try not to give away all the plot points of the movie in case some folks want to see it.

323
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:11,680
He has cancer! Cancer!

324
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:14,680
Yeah, whatever.

325
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:19,680
Alright, anything else we want to share?

326
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:21,680
No, really, no.

327
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:22,680
Okay.

328
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:25,680
Alright, uh, Angel, how was your week? How was your day?

329
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:29,680
Mmm, good. Hang on.

330
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:33,680
She was a salad and swallowing you.

331
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:35,680
I mean, I'm just kidding.

332
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:37,680
I'm very proud of Angel today.

333
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:38,680
What?

334
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:39,680
For eating a salad.

335
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:41,680
Well, yeah.

336
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:42,680
I'm very proud.

337
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:48,680
See, we may have just said that X4 had to do it, but, uh, he's on.

338
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:56,840
because I'm actually following the rules so we'll see how far this goes I've been

339
00:26:56,840 --> 00:27:01,100
I've been pretty good now I didn't agree to the no fast-food thing but I've only

340
00:27:01,100 --> 00:27:06,200
had fast food twice this week because I realized I did have it I had once today

341
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:09,680
and once after last week's show so I've been averaging only once a week so

342
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:12,680
that's not bad and when I go I don't supersize anything or whatever and I got

343
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:16,880
a decent sandwich so I think I'm doing okay you know it's better than my like

344
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:21,560
usually like three or four times a week so I'm good well feeling good for me

345
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:25,020
like I didn't really know where the guidelines went for me I just kind of

346
00:27:25,020 --> 00:27:29,700
grabbed the mic last week and I was like uh does that mean I gotta do it too and

347
00:27:29,700 --> 00:27:36,860
you guys just kind of gave me that look I'm like fine you know so yeah I'm doing

348
00:27:36,860 --> 00:27:41,980
really good I have been staying away from fast food and regular soda and blah

349
00:27:41,980 --> 00:27:46,300
blah blah and all that other stuff and I only ate one piece of candy on Halloween

350
00:27:46,300 --> 00:27:48,300
so damn it be proud!

351
00:27:48,300 --> 00:27:49,300
Good job!

352
00:27:49,300 --> 00:27:52,300
What was the candy? What was the candy that broke ya?

353
00:27:52,300 --> 00:27:54,300
Um, I think probably candy corn!

354
00:27:54,300 --> 00:27:55,300
It's just evil!

355
00:27:55,300 --> 00:27:59,300
Actually, no, it was like the little tiny square piece of um,

356
00:27:59,300 --> 00:28:01,300
Snickers or something.

357
00:28:01,300 --> 00:28:03,300
Oh, one's not gonna kill ya. I mean, one's okay.

358
00:28:03,300 --> 00:28:05,300
It's just that you can't have one five times a day.

359
00:28:05,300 --> 00:28:08,300
And like, uh, little tiny vanilla Tootsie Roll.

360
00:28:08,300 --> 00:28:09,300
Aww.

361
00:28:09,300 --> 00:28:11,300
They're so good!

362
00:28:11,300 --> 00:28:12,300
Oh wait, it was Halloween.

363
00:28:12,300 --> 00:28:14,300
Everybody was allowed to cheat on Halloween, right?

364
00:28:14,300 --> 00:28:20,300
Yeah, but I just kind of started anyway. I was just like, eh, whatever. I'm gonna get used to it. I'm gonna have to get used to it, so...

365
00:28:20,300 --> 00:28:22,300
All is good.

366
00:28:22,300 --> 00:28:25,300
When's our next weigh-in? When are we gonna do a weigh-in and check on the progress?

367
00:28:25,300 --> 00:28:26,300
After the show?

368
00:28:26,300 --> 00:28:28,300
Oh, crap. I didn't know we were doing that.

369
00:28:28,300 --> 00:28:30,300
Wait, did I just say yay? Oh dear.

370
00:28:30,300 --> 00:28:31,300
How about we do it in the last take?

371
00:28:31,300 --> 00:28:33,300
Okay, we can do that.

372
00:28:33,300 --> 00:28:35,300
Is it left, right over, and now we're progressing?

373
00:28:35,300 --> 00:28:37,300
I have everything written down.

374
00:28:37,300 --> 00:28:38,300
Okay.

375
00:28:38,300 --> 00:28:40,300
But only you can see.

376
00:28:40,300 --> 00:28:44,300
But I have to, but I've got to actually make up the chart for everybody.

377
00:28:44,300 --> 00:28:46,300
Okay. Sounds good.

378
00:28:46,300 --> 00:28:48,300
I'll look forward to later in the show.

379
00:28:48,300 --> 00:28:51,300
Oh! You remember that little thing I kind of announced last week?

380
00:28:51,300 --> 00:28:54,300
Like, oh boy, let's hope I get it or whatever.

381
00:28:54,300 --> 00:28:55,300
Uh-huh.

382
00:28:55,300 --> 00:29:02,300
I got word back, and I opened my email on Thursday at...

383
00:29:02,300 --> 00:29:05,300
What time was it? Probably about 6.30.

384
00:29:05,300 --> 00:29:10,900
Congratulations, you're a member of the member advisory board, which is that little council

385
00:29:10,900 --> 00:29:12,820
I was talking about last week.

386
00:29:12,820 --> 00:29:16,220
So what exactly will you be doing as a part of that?

387
00:29:16,220 --> 00:29:23,380
Six month term, working closely with staff to advise on the community and pretty much

388
00:29:23,380 --> 00:29:24,380
NDA stuff.

389
00:29:24,380 --> 00:29:25,380
Cool.

390
00:29:25,380 --> 00:29:26,380
Okay.

391
00:29:26,380 --> 00:29:27,380
Very cool.

392
00:29:27,380 --> 00:29:28,380
All right.

393
00:29:28,380 --> 00:29:29,380
Let's see.

394
00:29:29,380 --> 00:29:30,540
My week and my day.

395
00:29:30,540 --> 00:29:32,340
I just had a long week.

396
00:29:32,340 --> 00:29:34,100
I did a lot, a lot of work this week.

397
00:29:34,100 --> 00:29:37,400
it's been a very exhausting week but good I mean in a good way you know I

398
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:41,840
like my job and stuff so it's cool went out Friday night with the one and only

399
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:46,640
dark soccer that was pretty cool because we went out to one of the local bars so

400
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:50,900
we just kind of you know sat around we just we chilled I drink a lot yeah we

401
00:29:50,900 --> 00:29:55,240
watch people dance and I watched because I drove so I didn't get to really do I

402
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:59,000
have my one drink when we got there because it's okay to have one drink as

403
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,560
long as you provide yourself enough time for the drinks get out of your system

404
00:30:01,560 --> 00:30:06,760
him, which we did, because we were there a good two or three hours.

405
00:30:06,760 --> 00:30:11,520
But meanwhile, I watched DarkSakura drink, I don't know, like five different things,

406
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:17,760
four or five different things, and she was pretty happy by the time we ended up going

407
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:18,760
out to dinner.

408
00:30:18,760 --> 00:30:19,760
So it was a good time.

409
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:24,760
And I was introducing somebody new to Jamie, who got to meet Jamie for the first time.

410
00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:27,000
So I'm sure he kind of got a kick out of that.

411
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,440
No, he thought you were cool.

412
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:34,820
And then, you know, that night, actually, this would be Friday night, we were watching

413
00:30:34,820 --> 00:30:36,980
Elimidate at my friend's house.

414
00:30:36,980 --> 00:30:37,980
Not Jamie.

415
00:30:37,980 --> 00:30:42,260
Jamie was at home in bed by this point, but we were watching Elimidate, and on the TV

416
00:30:42,260 --> 00:30:48,660
came a commercial, and it's the commercial featuring our very own Dark Sakura and Loki

417
00:30:48,660 --> 00:30:54,220
for the Guitar Hero story that's going to be on TV on Tuesday, and it's awesome.

418
00:30:54,220 --> 00:30:57,880
And it was just cool to see that during Elimidate, because I know that's like one of Loki's favorite

419
00:30:57,880 --> 00:30:58,880
shows.

420
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:02,440
I thought Eliminate and Blind Date, because they're on back to back.

421
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:04,040
I know you guys watch Blind Date.

422
00:31:04,040 --> 00:31:06,040
It was on during both shows, actually.

423
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:07,040
So...

424
00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:08,040
Whatever.

425
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:13,540
Anyway, we actually have that story.

426
00:31:13,540 --> 00:31:14,540
So we're going to...

427
00:31:14,540 --> 00:31:16,040
Not the story, but we have a little promo.

428
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:23,520
I just want to play it for our listeners here, so they can hear Dark Sakura's quote that

429
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:26,420
will be in the news story, because it's pretty funny.

430
00:31:26,420 --> 00:31:28,640
So let's see here if we can get this to play.

431
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:35,040
a little bit of movie time here on Orange Launch Radio. Loading, loading, loading, come

432
00:31:35,040 --> 00:31:37,640
on. Here we go.

433
00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:40,640
Tuesday on WB58 News at Ten.

434
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:43,640
It feels like playing an actual guitar.

435
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:46,640
Get the rush of rocking out for an audience right in your own living room.

436
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:48,640
I love the remote, so I play that one and be sedated.

437
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:51,640
There's a fun new way to make your musical dreams a reality.

438
00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:54,640
You're actually creating music and playing in front of a crowd.

439
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:58,640
Find out why this rockin' new game could be a big hit this holiday season.

440
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:00,640
People of all ages are really getting into this.

441
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:04,640
Tuesday on WV58 News at 10.

442
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:13,640
I love how in that promo there's like one shot of Loki for like two, not even a second.

443
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:17,640
There's just like a shot of Loki going, no, no, no, the guitar and that's it.

444
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:21,640
It was the equivalent of Loki's foot basically being in the new story.

445
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:23,640
So it's great. And what else is new?

446
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:27,160
This seems to have a neat thing where I nod my head.

447
00:32:27,160 --> 00:32:31,280
I think that's cool that Dark Sakura is talking about their emotes.

448
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:34,400
That kind of amused me when I saw that on TV.

449
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:39,600
Anyway, we posted a link to that on the website, and of course Tuesday night is when the story

450
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:42,200
is going to air, and we will hopefully have something.

451
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:46,080
I'm thinking the news stations, because it looks like they put a lot of their news stories

452
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:48,980
on the website, so I'm thinking the news station might actually put it on their website, which

453
00:32:48,980 --> 00:32:52,280
would certainly make it easier for us to share it with all of you, because if they put the

454
00:32:52,280 --> 00:32:56,080
promo up there they'll put the story up there and then hopefully we'll have so

455
00:32:56,080 --> 00:33:02,200
much fun 2.0 so excited I hope you know I'm guessing they're not even gonna let

456
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:07,080
me say anything that's probably the guy in the background so what do you think

457
00:33:07,080 --> 00:33:11,240
about this game it and then they'll just cut away you know what's great is my

458
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:16,200
ignition pad is over there and it's in the background of one of the shots so my

459
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:19,720
My ignition pad got more screen time than you did.

460
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:25,120
My Konami guitars are out because we've been playing guitar freakin' before.

461
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:26,120
Right on.

462
00:33:26,120 --> 00:33:29,080
And the Joe Mania set was out.

463
00:33:29,080 --> 00:33:30,080
Awesome.

464
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:34,380
So, anyway, let's talk about Guitar Hero a little bit, because I finally managed to pick

465
00:33:34,380 --> 00:33:36,020
up the game this week.

466
00:33:36,020 --> 00:33:39,840
I picked up Guitar Hero, and I've been playing the shit out of it since yesterday when I

467
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:40,960
got it.

468
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:42,660
It's really great.

469
00:33:42,660 --> 00:33:47,780
I was really surprised, considering that, you know, the last game Red Octane put out

470
00:33:47,780 --> 00:33:49,480
I wasn't too impressed with.

471
00:33:49,480 --> 00:33:55,820
This one, being done by Harmonix, is so wonderful, and it really makes me hopeful for whatever

472
00:33:55,820 --> 00:34:00,060
Red Octane is going to do in the future, maybe going to some other types of music.

473
00:34:00,060 --> 00:34:04,340
I think the music game community is going to win big if this game does well, and a lot

474
00:34:04,340 --> 00:34:08,380
of early reviews for this game have great scores.

475
00:34:08,380 --> 00:34:12,300
Like I think GameSpot gave it a great review, I know 1UP.com gave it a perfect 10, was a

476
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:17,160
9.2 out of 10 that's higher than a lot of DDR games get so that's I think what

477
00:34:17,160 --> 00:34:22,020
people are really liking about the game is it's very accessible so it's it's it

478
00:34:22,020 --> 00:34:26,960
is it's a fun game my friend came over yesterday for our stargate marathon and

479
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:32,060
she was I was playing a game while she was making pancakes awesome and holy

480
00:34:32,060 --> 00:34:37,020
pancakes really yummy and I was playing just a couple of stuff she's like oh my

481
00:34:37,020 --> 00:34:41,120
god they got their original sounds like no no the cover songs are that good

482
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:43,120
But the covers are really good.

483
00:34:43,120 --> 00:34:46,120
They went to a great length to duplicate the effects.

484
00:34:46,120 --> 00:34:47,120
Yeah, they did.

485
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:52,620
I mean, some of them, like the Franz Ferdinand song that I kind of like, is in their sounds,

486
00:34:52,620 --> 00:34:53,620
just like the original.

487
00:34:53,620 --> 00:34:55,920
And like Iron Man sounds great.

488
00:34:55,920 --> 00:34:58,000
Some of them aren't exact, but they're close enough.

489
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,000
They're closer than any Karaoke Revolution I think has been.

490
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,720
I was freaking playing Thundercat 65.

491
00:35:01,720 --> 00:35:02,720
That was cool.

492
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:03,720
Yeah, it's awesome.

493
00:35:03,720 --> 00:35:04,720
It's got a great song.

494
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:09,120
My only kind of boo-hoo part is that there's not more songs playable at the very start

495
00:35:09,120 --> 00:35:13,120
because yesterday, you know, I had some people over, we were wanting to play Guitar Freaks,

496
00:35:13,120 --> 00:35:20,080
or Guitar Freaks Guitar Hero, whoops, we wanted to play Guitar Hero, and there was

497
00:35:20,080 --> 00:35:23,440
very little available at the very beginning of the game, so it's kind of like we actually

498
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:28,920
had to play a little bit to get some songs, so that was kind of a eh, but, you know, it

499
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:33,320
didn't take that long before we started opening more stuff, so.

500
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:36,320
They should let us pick the songs for the next game.

501
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:39,080
Seriously, where's Freebird?

502
00:35:39,080 --> 00:35:40,580
You think so? No Freebird!

503
00:35:40,580 --> 00:35:41,580
I want Freebird!

504
00:35:41,580 --> 00:35:43,080
They need to have Freebird in the sequel.

505
00:35:43,080 --> 00:35:45,080
No Freebird and no Stairway to Heaven!

506
00:35:45,080 --> 00:35:49,580
They need Freebird, and they need Stairway, and they need, um...

507
00:35:49,580 --> 00:35:50,080
Blur.

508
00:35:51,080 --> 00:35:53,580
I was gonna say Sweet Home Alabama, but I guess we already have...

509
00:35:53,580 --> 00:35:54,080
Blur.

510
00:35:54,080 --> 00:35:56,080
Um, sure, we can have Blur.

511
00:35:56,080 --> 00:35:59,580
Metallica? Like Old Metallica, not New Sellout Metallica?

512
00:36:01,080 --> 00:36:02,080
Metallica.

513
00:36:02,080 --> 00:36:19,080
I want to get some really hard rock stuff in here like you know I'm gonna get some metal like even get some filter in there you know some of that stuff even you know even though they've kind of dissolved as a band gravity kills would be fucking awesome because they just had really

514
00:36:19,080 --> 00:36:21,480
really good guitar sections in the whole stuff.

515
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:26,080
See, that and Rammstein. Rammstein had tons of really good guitar sections in their songs.

516
00:36:26,080 --> 00:36:28,080
We need Guns N' Roses.

517
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:30,780
Yeah, we need Welcome to the Jungle. I'm sorry.

518
00:36:30,780 --> 00:36:33,980
Welcome to the Jungle, man, welcome to the jungle.

519
00:36:33,980 --> 00:36:37,880
I hope they link up to a later game. I hope they decide to do a drum game.

520
00:36:37,880 --> 00:36:40,280
I mean, I guess that would be too similar. But maybe hook up...

521
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:43,180
Well, I guess they can't even hook up to Karaoke Revolution because it's another company.

522
00:36:43,180 --> 00:36:44,980
But somehow hook up to another music...

523
00:36:44,980 --> 00:36:46,180
Me too!

524
00:36:46,180 --> 00:36:51,740
You know what Red Octane should revive is keyboard games.

525
00:36:51,740 --> 00:36:55,780
They should launch a keyboard game that would be badass.

526
00:36:55,780 --> 00:37:00,020
Expensive but fun.

527
00:37:00,020 --> 00:37:02,500
Van Halen would be awesome too.

528
00:37:02,500 --> 00:37:06,380
A lot of great suggestions there in our chat room. www.orangelaunchradio.com

529
00:37:06,380 --> 00:37:08,980
Click on chat.

530
00:37:08,980 --> 00:37:13,500
Like a song that needs to be in the next Guitar Hero? I'm down for that.

531
00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:14,380
We're going to do that.

532
00:37:14,380 --> 00:37:17,740
Alright, so we'll be prepared for that a little later in the show.

533
00:37:17,740 --> 00:37:20,840
What else I wanted to say about Guitar Hero though, you know what my favorite thing about

534
00:37:20,840 --> 00:37:22,100
Guitar Hero?

535
00:37:22,100 --> 00:37:24,020
Is the art direction.

536
00:37:24,020 --> 00:37:29,860
The art, and like the sets, and the little like, just like there's little jokes that

537
00:37:29,860 --> 00:37:33,500
make the cold game go, like when you're loading and going to a new stage it shows it turning

538
00:37:33,500 --> 00:37:34,500
up to 11.

539
00:37:34,500 --> 00:37:39,060
You know that's the female guitarist, with the short black and red hair, who is actually

540
00:37:39,060 --> 00:37:40,420
modeled off of a real person.

541
00:37:40,420 --> 00:37:41,420
Really?

542
00:37:41,420 --> 00:37:42,860
Aren't they all supposed to be modeled off real people?

543
00:37:42,860 --> 00:37:45,980
Well, I know there's like the Keith Richards clone that I just sort of freaked out over

544
00:37:45,980 --> 00:37:50,060
because the first time I saw him pop up was with a flying V. I was like, it's my dog!

545
00:37:50,060 --> 00:37:51,060
Yeah.

546
00:37:51,060 --> 00:37:52,060
Nerd moment!

547
00:37:52,060 --> 00:37:56,620
And, yeah, I just, the art direction of the game isn't, like the little pictures drawn

548
00:37:56,620 --> 00:38:00,060
on the notebook, like they even have a unicorn drawn on the notebook, which made me think

549
00:38:00,060 --> 00:38:04,700
of, anyway, I forget it, um, but the art direction of the game is great.

550
00:38:04,700 --> 00:38:11,620
And there's just all these, I like the way it's set up, like it's different than a Bomani

551
00:38:11,620 --> 00:38:12,620
game.

552
00:38:12,620 --> 00:38:15,620
Really? Why is that just the ISO perspective thing?

553
00:38:15,620 --> 00:38:18,620
Yeah. And the way it's moving? That's too bad.

554
00:38:18,620 --> 00:38:21,620
I like the way it's set up. It's not like a Bomani game.

555
00:38:21,620 --> 00:38:24,620
Because, you know, in most Bomani games, it's like, walk up, play, walk away.

556
00:38:24,620 --> 00:38:31,620
And even on the home versions, until Extreme 2's mission mode, or whatever the hell it was called,

557
00:38:31,620 --> 00:38:37,620
until Extreme 2's thing, most of the DDR home games and most 2DX and Beatmania guitar freaks,

558
00:38:37,620 --> 00:38:40,620
it's just walk up, play your songs, walk away.

559
00:38:40,620 --> 00:38:42,620
The music is not nitty.

560
00:38:42,620 --> 00:38:43,620
Well, that's true too.

561
00:38:43,620 --> 00:38:44,620
That is awesome.

562
00:38:44,620 --> 00:38:47,620
I'm talking about the setup, the way the game is presented.

563
00:38:47,620 --> 00:38:50,620
Like, you know how in DDR, it's walk up, play your songs, walk away.

564
00:38:50,620 --> 00:38:54,620
I like how Guitar Hero kind of has that setup, like the career mode.

565
00:38:54,620 --> 00:38:56,620
And it's like, you know, oh, we're going to play at the house.

566
00:38:56,620 --> 00:39:00,620
And then you get the review in the newspaper, and it shows the newspaper with the rating.

567
00:39:00,620 --> 00:39:02,620
That's why it breaks out.

568
00:39:02,620 --> 00:39:06,620
And then it shows the bill with your manager's cut, and the food cut, and the bribery cuts,

569
00:39:06,620 --> 00:39:08,620
and all that stuff, leaving you with so much money.

570
00:39:08,620 --> 00:39:13,420
so much money. All that little stuff goes a long way in amusing me greatly, and that's

571
00:39:13,420 --> 00:39:17,300
important to amuse me greatly. So the way the game is presented, it's not the same even

572
00:39:17,300 --> 00:39:21,340
as amplitude and frequency, because amplitude and frequency is almost walk up, player songs

573
00:39:21,340 --> 00:39:26,680
walk away. The way the Guitar Hero is set up is cool, and is part of what makes that

574
00:39:26,680 --> 00:39:32,700
game so great, and stand out so much differently than Guitar Freaks. Honestly, Guitar Heroes

575
00:39:32,700 --> 00:39:37,800
and Guitar Freaks are very different games. Yes, they both use guitar controllers, but

576
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:40,920
You've got Guitar Hero has five buttons, which changes things completely.

577
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:42,600
And the whammy bar!

578
00:39:42,600 --> 00:39:43,600
And the whammy bar!

579
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:44,600
Absolutely.

580
00:39:44,600 --> 00:39:46,160
I was wailing hard, okay?

581
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:51,480
The way you turn your guitar up, the wailing thing, like in Guitar Freaks it was called

582
00:39:51,480 --> 00:39:56,120
a wailing bonus, it's done like strategy-wise in Guitar Hero.

583
00:39:56,120 --> 00:40:00,280
Like you want to tilt your guitar up at a certain time to maximize your score.

584
00:40:00,280 --> 00:40:03,840
Like they put a little thought into, okay, what could the guitar tilts do?

585
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:06,880
And then it also changes the animation on screen so your guy just starts going fucking

586
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:11,320
nuts like spinning guitars around and stuff. One thing I do sort of miss is it was in Guitar

587
00:40:11,320 --> 00:40:18,320
Freaks with the hidden notes. Where if you, you know, managed to find the hidden notes,

588
00:40:18,320 --> 00:40:23,720
it would just pop up a whole new set of notes. Or the open picks. Yeah. But still, I mean,

589
00:40:23,720 --> 00:40:28,420
Guitar Hero has... You should get freestyle points. Oh, like a freestyle mode? Yeah. Well,

590
00:40:28,420 --> 00:40:32,480
Guitar Hero still has a long way to go, too. I mean, this is just the first release, and

591
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:36,620
kind of hope that there'll be more releases of this in the future and I

592
00:40:36,620 --> 00:40:39,320
think I think this game has the potential to do very well I know I

593
00:40:39,320 --> 00:40:42,040
bought the last copy of Best Buy yesterday so that means they're already

594
00:40:42,040 --> 00:40:47,800
selling out and I got mine right when the shipment arrived at our game stop

595
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:55,660
right low-key oops I was going to mention that the

596
00:40:55,660 --> 00:41:00,640
game's not even supposed to be out yet but technically but actually I'm going to go

597
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:06,640
So I wouldn't say officially it had no street date on any of their ship packages, therefore it could be released as they do.

598
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:15,640
Well yeah, I mean, games don't really have street dates, but the whole thing was they were not supposed to be shipping until Tuesday anyways, so a lot of the stuff's early.

599
00:41:15,640 --> 00:41:22,640
I think that's kind of one of those things, they did it in the groove the very same way, like it didn't really have an official release date, it was just, you know, we're going to ship it out whenever you get it.

600
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:25,640
We got it pressed faster than we thought we would, so here you go.

601
00:41:25,640 --> 00:41:26,640
So that's cool.

602
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:30,640
I mean, so it's out there now if you guys want to look around, but probably Tuesday,

603
00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:33,520
Wednesday is when you're really going to start seeing this game out there just about everywhere.

604
00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:35,320
And I think it has the potential to do very well.

605
00:41:35,320 --> 00:41:38,760
I thought it was interesting, and I remember bringing this up on the show before about

606
00:41:38,760 --> 00:41:43,480
the MTV partnership with the game, but I kind of forgot about it until I booted up the game

607
00:41:43,480 --> 00:41:45,080
and saw the MTV logo.

608
00:41:45,080 --> 00:41:48,840
And even though MTV kind of sucks, I think the partnership is going to be great exposure

609
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:49,840
for the game.

610
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:55,000
And what's really cool about the game is that all the unlocked songs are unsigned bands

611
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:58,760
with a real song like the people that won the Be A Guitar Hero contest

612
00:41:58,760 --> 00:42:01,920
and you know, littler bands, I guess I shouldn't say unsigned, but more

613
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:06,720
littler, not-so-hurt bands. The only band in there I'd really heard of before was

614
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:08,160
Freeze Pop

615
00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:12,600
because they have a song in there that you unlock and it's badass. I love the Freeze Pop song.

616
00:42:12,600 --> 00:42:14,080
Get ready to rock.

617
00:42:14,080 --> 00:42:16,200
It's great.

618
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:18,240
So anyway, I definitely give a

619
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:21,760
glowing review to Guitar Hero. I think it's fabulous and you all should go buy it if you want to

620
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:25,320
play guitar game. The price tag is a little bit high, so maybe they'll come down in price

621
00:42:25,320 --> 00:42:30,480
after Christmas, and maybe it would be a better time to get it, but it's great. It's so much

622
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:37,480
fun. Any other thoughts on guitar hero? No, we'll talk a little...oh, Angel.

623
00:42:38,200 --> 00:42:44,640
I like how the notes at the bottom of the screen, like the colors for the notes, because

624
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:49,480
it obviously goes with the buttons, but they're bright on the screen, so for me, it'll be

625
00:42:49,480 --> 00:42:56,480
easier to play since I am color and shape oriented. Well, you guys knew that, but yeah,

626
00:42:56,840 --> 00:43:03,840
so it'll be easier for me to play, and for those that have difficulty like I do, well,

627
00:43:04,600 --> 00:43:08,480
it'll be a good thing, so I can't wait to pick it up! Ah!

628
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:14,480
Alright, sounds good. Yeah, it's very bright, and all the colors stand out. It's very nice.

629
00:43:14,480 --> 00:43:18,440
I can see it! Very nice. Basically, the way it's set up, just imagine

630
00:43:18,440 --> 00:43:22,080
its frequency or amplitude except you don't move around the tube it's just the

631
00:43:22,080 --> 00:43:25,920
ISO view of the notes coming at you which sometimes can be a little bit

632
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:29,320
bothersome though because you can't see the notes as far in advance and for me

633
00:43:29,320 --> 00:43:33,120
I'm really big on noticing the measures like in guitar freaks you can see the

634
00:43:33,120 --> 00:43:36,520
little lines that show you the measures but in guitar hero it's harder to see

635
00:43:36,520 --> 00:43:40,720
those lines and judge because it's at an ISO perspective so it's kind of I don't

636
00:43:40,720 --> 00:43:43,960
know it's kind of tricky but those are really minor minor complaints I would

637
00:43:43,960 --> 00:43:47,400
hope that in a later version you could maybe change that like tilt the

638
00:43:47,400 --> 00:43:50,700
perspective to something that works better for me like that would be great

639
00:43:50,700 --> 00:43:54,000
if you could freely rotate the perspective I'm sure it's possible but

640
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,980
that's a very minor complaint in the scope of things honestly it's a great

641
00:43:56,980 --> 00:44:03,740
first release a lot of promising things kick-ass song list I love it it's great

642
00:44:03,740 --> 00:44:07,500
all right so I think what we'll do is we go to a break and we come back from

643
00:44:07,500 --> 00:44:10,860
break we're going to talk a little bit about I want to talk about DDR Mario mix

644
00:44:10,860 --> 00:44:15,940
for a minute and then we're also going to do tonight's list lists about guitar

645
00:44:15,940 --> 00:44:20,280
guitar hero. We haven't done listless in a long time, so that'll be cool. Now, unfortunately,

646
00:44:20,280 --> 00:44:25,460
I don't have any music from Guitar Hero yet. I only have guitar freaks. But since we're

647
00:44:25,460 --> 00:44:30,480
in a guitar-shaking mood right now, we have to, I guess, take a moment to recognize some

648
00:44:30,480 --> 00:44:34,420
guitar freaks. So we'll be back after this. Maybe we'll have some Guitar Hero music later

649
00:44:34,420 --> 00:44:38,480
on. We're gonna try and rip some of the music from it. The songs are very long. Like, there's

650
00:44:38,480 --> 00:44:41,560
some songs in there. Yeah, they're like five-minute-long songs.

651
00:44:41,560 --> 00:44:45,560
I think I'm playing Smoke on the Water.

652
00:44:45,560 --> 00:44:49,560
My hand is about to fall off.

653
00:44:49,560 --> 00:44:53,560
This song's long. It's like seven minutes.

654
00:44:53,560 --> 00:44:56,560
We'll be back after this with more Orange Lounge Radio.

655
00:44:56,560 --> 00:44:59,560
I guess we'll start off this break with a little bit of...

656
00:44:59,560 --> 00:45:01,560
We'll start off with a classic Guitar Freaks tune.

657
00:45:01,560 --> 00:45:04,040
We'll be back after this with more Orange Lounge Radio.

658
00:46:31,560 --> 00:46:59,560
Now get an eight niner to scramble I got my car all set to scramble

659
00:46:59,560 --> 00:47:02,560
Don't really know where I'm from, so

660
00:47:02,560 --> 00:47:04,560
I've been put down on the pedal

661
00:47:04,560 --> 00:47:07,560
I've got pedals to the metal

662
00:47:07,560 --> 00:47:11,560
Rolled down the highway just like a fireball

663
00:47:11,560 --> 00:47:15,560
Turned my concealer so loud there's a fireball burnin' out of control

664
00:47:15,560 --> 00:47:20,560
Ain't no tornado, so smile over the sky like I can't move

665
00:47:22,560 --> 00:47:23,560
Yes, I can

666
00:47:23,560 --> 00:47:47,560
This is my transition, nuclear fission, minimal role

667
00:47:47,560 --> 00:47:51,560
I need a guy to beat a fireball, burning powder to go

668
00:47:51,560 --> 00:47:55,560
God has to live his every way, but that is in our own

669
00:47:55,560 --> 00:47:59,560
Speaking and his spirit's far off, we have to go

670
00:48:00,560 --> 00:48:01,560
I'm gonna getcha!

671
00:48:01,560 --> 00:48:08,560
It's great, man!

672
00:51:01,560 --> 00:51:31,240
Baby do you want the juice, baby do you want it, baby do you want the juice, baby do you

673
00:51:31,240 --> 00:51:52,920
We're back here kids on Orange Lounge Radio and we're just trekking on along here after

674
00:51:52,920 --> 00:51:54,480
that Guitar Freaks break.

675
00:51:54,480 --> 00:51:59,860
We were checking out during the break some folks in our chat room posted that some websites

676
00:51:59,860 --> 00:52:05,380
out there have leaked some new Beatmania screenshots, screens from the brand new Beatmania game,

677
00:52:05,380 --> 00:52:09,460
and I totally missed this. I guess these were actually released earlier in the week. But

678
00:52:09,460 --> 00:52:13,940
very interesting, some of these screenshots. Maybe I missed this before, if this was previously

679
00:52:13,940 --> 00:52:18,720
announced, but I noticed one of these screens shows the free scratching zone deal, which

680
00:52:18,720 --> 00:52:25,180
kind of looks like, it looks like the freeze notes in the seventh mix in the final that

681
00:52:25,180 --> 00:52:26,180
they had, but they're not quite...

682
00:52:26,180 --> 00:52:29,180
No, this is something way back from Five Key.

683
00:52:29,180 --> 00:52:31,180
I don't remember the free scratching zone.

684
00:52:31,180 --> 00:52:34,180
Yeah, this has been in there since even Beat Media 2.

685
00:52:34,180 --> 00:52:36,180
God, I totally don't remember them.

686
00:52:36,180 --> 00:52:40,180
Okay, well that's cool. I forgot about them.

687
00:52:40,180 --> 00:52:42,180
How often do they use them in songs?

688
00:52:42,180 --> 00:52:43,180
Not very.

689
00:52:43,180 --> 00:52:49,180
The Five Key game I probably played the most of was Beat Media 6 Mix and Core, that release,

690
00:52:49,180 --> 00:52:51,180
and I don't remember seeing this in there.

691
00:52:51,180 --> 00:52:54,180
There was like a couple songs, a handful.

692
00:52:54,180 --> 00:53:01,180
Very interesting purple-y interface there, and also, by the way, which shows that V is in the game,

693
00:53:01,180 --> 00:53:05,180
but that shouldn't be a big shock to anybody that V is going to turn up in Beat Media USA.

694
00:53:05,180 --> 00:53:06,180
Why not? It's been like every other...

695
00:53:06,180 --> 00:53:10,180
Every Japanese release since 5th, every single one.

696
00:53:10,180 --> 00:53:13,180
Did you know that 10th Style is only like a few days away?

697
00:53:13,180 --> 00:53:16,180
It's not that far. I think 10th Style is like 10 days away, somebody was telling me.

698
00:53:16,180 --> 00:53:18,180
Crazy.

699
00:53:18,180 --> 00:53:22,180
So Beat Media is very purple. It's a very different interface.

700
00:53:22,180 --> 00:53:26,180
I can appreciate that they're doing something new with it, not just, you know, cloning a

701
00:53:26,180 --> 00:53:30,100
Japanese release and taking out some songs and putting in different ones.

702
00:53:30,100 --> 00:53:35,100
It makes the game feel very much like ours, even if you don't care for purple or don't

703
00:53:35,100 --> 00:53:38,100
really care for the interface, at least it's something a little different.

704
00:53:38,100 --> 00:53:39,100
Analogy?

705
00:53:39,100 --> 00:53:40,100
Sure.

706
00:53:40,100 --> 00:53:42,100
That's what I thought.

707
00:53:42,100 --> 00:53:47,740
Anyway, so if you want to check those out, it looks like oneof.com has posted some of

708
00:53:47,740 --> 00:53:50,620
those screenshots, but I'm sure they've made their way around the internet.

709
00:53:50,620 --> 00:53:55,580
check your favorite Game News Wire site, and I'm sure you can check out some more of those

710
00:53:55,580 --> 00:53:57,580
pictures for yourself.

711
00:53:57,580 --> 00:53:59,820
All right.

712
00:53:59,820 --> 00:54:04,520
I think what we'll do now, before we get to List List, because I don't think everyone's

713
00:54:04,520 --> 00:54:09,220
quite ready to go yet, I think what maybe we'll do is we'll go to the Skype line and

714
00:54:09,220 --> 00:54:15,500
take some telephone calls on the Skype line, www.orangelaunchradio.com, and click on Interact

715
00:54:15,500 --> 00:54:22,380
with us if you would like to get more information about how you can call the program. You can

716
00:54:22,380 --> 00:54:27,940
either use your computer using a program called Skype, or you can actually use our brand new

717
00:54:27,940 --> 00:54:32,980
phone number, which I don't remember off the top of my head, but it's posted on the website.

718
00:54:32,980 --> 00:54:35,340
But the phone's already ringing. I don't need to give out that phone number. We're going

719
00:54:35,340 --> 00:54:38,060
to go right to a call. So, hello, you're on Orange Lawn's radio.

720
00:54:38,060 --> 00:54:41,300
Hey, Skye, I'm Ziggy here. Hey, Ziggy, how you doing?

721
00:54:41,300 --> 00:54:44,180
uh... but i thought that they did right now

722
00:54:44,180 --> 00:54:45,640
you were right

723
00:54:45,640 --> 00:54:47,140
a little bit and

724
00:54:47,140 --> 00:54:49,020
anticipated like that

725
00:54:49,020 --> 00:54:49,980
because uh...

726
00:54:49,980 --> 00:54:52,500
ten days left beat me to the extent

727
00:54:52,500 --> 00:54:53,660
i'll see it

728
00:54:53,660 --> 00:54:56,540
that's right you tell me about this before the show that we we don't have

729
00:54:56,540 --> 00:54:59,880
much longer to go before ten thousand we out that's awesome

730
00:54:59,880 --> 00:55:03,340
yeah well i got a little news about ten thousand yes for those who haven't

731
00:55:03,340 --> 00:55:04,900
caught up with it yet

732
00:55:04,900 --> 00:55:06,140
but yeah what's that

733
00:55:06,140 --> 00:55:10,740
two happy sky songs have been confirmed by ten thousand yes

734
00:55:10,740 --> 00:55:11,960
what's that

735
00:55:11,960 --> 00:55:15,040
that uh... lesson five and under the sky

736
00:55:15,040 --> 00:55:19,420
awesome so um... that we get a little so that we don't just get one we get to

737
00:55:19,420 --> 00:55:21,700
happy sky songs that's good news

738
00:55:21,700 --> 00:55:25,420
so far there have been a twenty four unconfirmed songs yet

739
00:55:25,420 --> 00:55:27,120
no really

740
00:55:27,120 --> 00:55:30,760
probably until this thursday we walk we won't be seeing the uh... you know

741
00:55:30,760 --> 00:55:34,100
economy's gonna reveal the uh... entire complete song list

742
00:55:34,100 --> 00:55:35,900
hopefully by this thursday

743
00:55:35,900 --> 00:55:38,660
well yeah i think if the game comes out very soon

744
00:55:38,660 --> 00:55:40,260
all those songs of course

745
00:55:40,260 --> 00:55:44,020
you know by l.e.d.

746
00:55:44,020 --> 00:55:46,860
it's all v it's all remixes of v

747
00:55:46,860 --> 00:55:51,540
yeah v has been confirmed for beat me in the u.s.

748
00:55:51,540 --> 00:55:55,940
not a big surprise though honestly not a big surprise to me either

749
00:55:55,940 --> 00:55:58,600
so in fact if v hadn't have been there

750
00:55:58,600 --> 00:56:01,200
you know people would have complained

751
00:56:01,200 --> 00:56:04,100
where's v? why did they put v in there?

752
00:56:04,100 --> 00:56:06,380
konami hates us konami hates america

753
00:56:06,380 --> 00:56:08,380
coming out of the u.s.a.

754
00:56:08,380 --> 00:56:10,580
why did they put my fucking video in there?

755
00:56:10,580 --> 00:56:12,100
so

756
00:56:12,100 --> 00:56:14,040
you know that's how it would have been

757
00:56:14,040 --> 00:56:15,220
yeah

758
00:56:15,220 --> 00:56:16,460
uh...

759
00:56:16,460 --> 00:56:20,520
talking about uh... other stuff uh... well you haven't premiered the uh...

760
00:56:20,520 --> 00:56:24,980
motsu moto go the goalie allies bonus track yet right no i i keep meaning to

761
00:56:24,980 --> 00:56:28,880
and i always forget to uh... play it but it's it's a great so i love the video

762
00:56:28,880 --> 00:56:32,340
the video is very cool i really love the video too and i'm hoping that this song is going to be

763
00:56:32,340 --> 00:56:35,420
on the tenth style cds you know as a bonus song

764
00:56:35,420 --> 00:56:38,020
it might that'd be cool

765
00:56:38,020 --> 00:56:41,460
if those who should i reveal it now or uh... sure do it

766
00:56:41,460 --> 00:56:42,900
okay

767
00:56:42,900 --> 00:56:46,040
here's from the uh... gory allies bonus track

768
00:56:46,040 --> 00:56:50,060
here's uh... taro with al-farsi r about i think it is going to name it all but i

769
00:56:50,060 --> 00:56:54,180
had actually played a lot of not about that

770
00:56:54,180 --> 00:56:58,080
after all we can play will play uh... how long is that i don't know what it is

771
00:56:58,080 --> 00:57:00,760
about two minutes uh... forty five second but i thought that while we go

772
00:57:00,760 --> 00:57:03,260
ahead and play that um... i gotta get it though here we go

773
00:57:03,260 --> 00:57:04,780
okay so here it is well okay

774
00:57:04,780 --> 00:57:10,180
from the top. Introduce it again. Here's the Golielek's bonus track and

775
00:57:10,180 --> 00:57:14,100
Tarah with Al-Farshir. And for those in the studio, you can see the video if you want.

776
00:57:14,100 --> 00:57:15,100
It's pretty cool.

777
00:59:15,100 --> 00:59:17,100
You

778
00:59:45,100 --> 00:59:52,540
Now, that song is pretty badass, I gotta say. It's a really good song, and I do hope that

779
00:59:52,540 --> 00:59:55,220
song does turn up in Ten Style's one of the hidden tracks, because it's great. And the

780
00:59:55,220 --> 00:59:58,580
video's great, too. Like, you know, we're kind of sitting here in the studio watching

781
00:59:58,580 --> 01:00:01,940
it, and I'm hearing, ooh, I need an LJ, how can I do that? Ooh, I need to cosplay that.

782
01:00:01,940 --> 01:00:06,220
I need to do this. So it's got a nice video. I like the setup. For those who weren't able

783
01:00:06,220 --> 01:00:12,020
to see the video, it basically is kind of like this epic battle with all the 2DX characters.

784
01:00:12,020 --> 01:00:14,020
That's kind of what it is, it looks like.

785
01:00:14,020 --> 01:00:15,020
Yeah.

786
01:00:15,020 --> 01:00:17,020
It's like a bit from Eden.

787
01:00:17,020 --> 01:00:18,020
Yeah.

788
01:00:18,020 --> 01:00:27,020
And some just, like, Lilith is, you know, I mean, Siren is dying on Lilith's arms.

789
01:00:27,020 --> 01:00:28,020
Mm-hmm.

790
01:00:28,020 --> 01:00:31,020
And then, you know, for those who haven't seen the, for those who haven't watched the

791
01:00:31,020 --> 01:00:39,020
video yet, and then in the end, like, it's Erica and Shiloh, like, in each other's arms.

792
01:00:39,020 --> 01:00:41,020
Yeah, it's a neat video.

793
01:00:41,020 --> 01:00:45,020
If you're into the 2DX characters and the artwork behind it, it's just a great video

794
01:00:45,020 --> 01:00:46,220
that compliments it very well.

795
01:00:46,220 --> 01:00:49,620
So thank you for reminding us to check that out, because it's a pretty cool one.

796
01:00:49,620 --> 01:00:50,620
So thank you.

797
01:00:50,620 --> 01:00:51,620
And no problem.

798
01:00:51,620 --> 01:00:52,620
All right.

799
01:00:52,620 --> 01:00:55,220
Well, anything else you want to share with our listeners?

800
01:00:55,220 --> 01:00:56,420
Well, nothing much else.

801
01:00:56,420 --> 01:01:00,340
Hopefully when I get my copy of Tensa, I will give you the details.

802
01:01:00,340 --> 01:01:01,340
All right.

803
01:01:01,340 --> 01:01:02,340
Sounds good.

804
01:01:02,340 --> 01:01:03,340
We'll be looking forward to hearing it.

805
01:01:03,340 --> 01:01:04,340
Yeah.

806
01:01:04,340 --> 01:01:05,340
All right.

807
01:01:05,340 --> 01:01:06,340
Take care, buddy.

808
01:01:06,340 --> 01:01:07,340
Have a good one.

809
01:01:07,340 --> 01:01:08,340
Later.

810
01:01:08,340 --> 01:01:09,340
Later.

811
01:01:09,340 --> 01:01:15,340
Okay, um, we're gonna go to another call now here on the Skyline, and we'll see what this person wants.

812
01:01:15,340 --> 01:01:17,340
Hello, you're on Orange Lawn's radio.

813
01:01:18,340 --> 01:01:19,340
Guys there?

814
01:01:19,340 --> 01:01:21,340
Yes, we're here. Can you hear me?

815
01:01:21,340 --> 01:01:23,340
We can kinda hear you. What's up?

816
01:01:23,340 --> 01:01:26,340
Uh, not much. I'm eating Doritos.

817
01:01:26,340 --> 01:01:29,340
You're eating Doritos again, huh? How you doin'?

818
01:01:29,340 --> 01:01:32,340
Uh, I got nachos this time.

819
01:01:32,340 --> 01:01:34,340
I'm sorry?

820
01:01:34,340 --> 01:01:36,340
We got nacho cheese this time.

821
01:01:36,340 --> 01:01:40,180

822
01:01:40,180 --> 01:01:41,980

824
01:01:44,300 --> 01:01:47,140
you're hyped for mario kart ds i'm really hyped for this too i think it's

825
01:01:47,140 --> 01:01:48,520
going to be awesome to you

826
01:01:48,520 --> 01:01:53,460
be able to play people across the uh... internet and all that stuff

827
01:01:53,460 --> 01:01:56,380
news video i just saw it

828
01:01:56,380 --> 01:01:58,060
was it twenty five minutes

829
01:01:58,060 --> 01:01:59,140
just

830
01:01:59,140 --> 01:02:01,460
bunch of stuff

831
01:02:01,460 --> 01:02:02,420
crazy

832
01:02:02,420 --> 01:02:06,420
So, um, this game's out, what, like a week from Tuesday or something?

833
01:02:06,420 --> 01:02:10,420
It's out, um, yeah. It's the week of the 14th?

834
01:02:10,420 --> 01:02:11,420
Sometime during that week.

835
01:02:11,420 --> 01:02:12,420
That's the date.

836
01:02:12,420 --> 01:02:15,420
I'm excited for it. It's gonna be a good time.

837
01:02:15,420 --> 01:02:16,420
Yeah.

838
01:02:16,420 --> 01:02:21,420
So, um, and now I hear you can have, like, up to 50 people on your friends list or something through the game?

839
01:02:21,420 --> 01:02:23,420
Uh, I don't know. They didn't say that.

840
01:02:23,420 --> 01:02:25,420
It's only four players, though, over the Internet.

841
01:02:25,420 --> 01:02:27,420
Well, I'm not too surprised by that,

842
01:02:27,420 --> 01:02:30,420
because eight people would be an awful lot of bandwidth to have going everywhere.

843
01:02:30,420 --> 01:02:35,420
Yeah, you don't want all that lag and stuff.

844
01:02:35,420 --> 01:02:38,420
Any other games coming out soon that you're looking forward to?

845
01:02:38,420 --> 01:02:43,420
You still have to give Midway Arcade Treasures 3 and DDR Mario Mix.

846
01:02:43,420 --> 01:02:50,420
Midway Arcade Treasures 3 is pretty good. It's a pretty solid game, if you like racing games.

847
01:02:50,420 --> 01:02:55,420
If you're waiting for more Midway Arcade stuff for the PSP,

848
01:02:55,420 --> 01:03:00,040
Arcade Treasures extended play is coming out in December which is going to have a

849
01:03:00,040 --> 01:03:02,560
bunch of the old stuff plus Mortal Kombat 1 and 2.

850
01:03:02,560 --> 01:03:06,280
Very cool. I know about that. Very cool.

851
01:03:06,280 --> 01:03:09,840
Alright, anything else you want to share with our listeners?

852
01:03:09,840 --> 01:03:13,060
Oh yeah, I got a link to this one site. There's this guy

853
01:03:13,060 --> 01:03:16,260
who has like made tons of progress on

854
01:03:16,260 --> 01:03:20,600
hacking the DS's Wi-Fi chip and stuff. He's pretty much got it,

855
01:03:20,600 --> 01:03:27,600
running. Huh. So what does it do? Right now he's just trying to make the connection to

856
01:03:28,100 --> 01:03:34,800
a Wi-Fi hotspot. Yeah, this is a guy that's, he's already won the bounty basically for

857
01:03:34,800 --> 01:03:40,700
the Wi-Fi, and now he's just finishing up like the last bit of it, but he finished enough

858
01:03:40,700 --> 01:03:45,100
of it to where they gave him like, I think it was like $4,000. Oh, I remember you mentioning

859
01:03:45,100 --> 01:03:47,100
that on a previous podcast about that.

860
01:03:47,100 --> 01:03:48,100
Very cool.

861
01:03:48,100 --> 01:03:49,100
1400?

862
01:03:49,100 --> 01:03:50,100
Like that?

863
01:03:50,100 --> 01:03:51,100
Something?

864
01:03:51,100 --> 01:03:52,100
Yeah.

865
01:03:52,100 --> 01:03:58,260
Well, that link's in our chat room, www.orangelandradio.com, click on chat.

866
01:03:58,260 --> 01:04:06,740
Another thing, just more Mario Kart DS stuff, there's actually a, the decal maker, you know

867
01:04:06,740 --> 01:04:07,740
what I'm talking about?

868
01:04:07,740 --> 01:04:10,780
The decals you can have in it?

869
01:04:10,780 --> 01:04:11,780
On Mario Kart?

870
01:04:11,780 --> 01:04:14,780
Yeah, can't you make your own decal or something when you're on the internet?

871
01:04:14,780 --> 01:04:23,780
Yeah, it has a thing that'll appear next to your name and also actually go on your cart on the front of it and stuff.

872
01:04:23,780 --> 01:04:24,780
Yeah, that sounds kind of cool.

873
01:04:24,780 --> 01:04:29,780
I'm going to post another link. They actually have a decal base on this site.

874
01:04:29,780 --> 01:04:34,780
And you can make one before the game's even out, which is really cool.

875
01:04:34,780 --> 01:04:43,780
I've got one here. It's actually the Firefox logo, and it looks really good for just like 17 colors.

876
01:04:43,780 --> 01:04:48,780
It uses that technique of criss-crossing colors, you know what I'm talking about?

877
01:04:48,780 --> 01:04:49,780
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

878
01:04:49,780 --> 01:04:51,780
To make them look like a different color.

879
01:04:51,780 --> 01:04:57,780
Okay, I'm going to check that. So wait, you can make this before the game is out, so you'll be able to transfer it from your PC somehow?

880
01:04:57,780 --> 01:05:05,780
Well, you're not going to be able to transfer it, but you can, like, plan out and make one already, so then, like, you're going to have to recreate it, unfortunately, but...

881
01:05:07,780 --> 01:05:09,780
Mr. Game & Watch!

882
01:05:09,780 --> 01:05:12,780
Jamie's getting excited over there because she saw Mr. Game & Watch, so...

883
01:05:12,780 --> 01:05:14,780
Yeah, that's fun.

884
01:05:14,780 --> 01:05:15,780
Awesome, it's going to be a good time.

885
01:05:15,780 --> 01:05:21,780
Alright, well thanks for sharing all those links with us, and we'll be all ready to kick your ass when Mario Kart DS comes out.

886
01:05:21,780 --> 01:05:24,780
Oh, don't be so sure about that.

887
01:05:24,780 --> 01:05:29,780
It's on tournaments and we will have some type of orange lounge DS

888
01:05:29,780 --> 01:05:34,000
I thought I'm sure we want to I know my dream is to have the orange lounge village on a

889
01:05:34,260 --> 01:05:40,420
Animal crossing where you can come you can come to our town and have Jamie wacky with a bug net

890
01:05:42,260 --> 01:05:45,260
I'll be a good time. We'll have that set up Sunday nights during the show or something

891
01:05:45,260 --> 01:05:49,780
We'll have like the orange lounge village where you can come I have all these great ideas. I can't wait

892
01:05:49,780 --> 01:05:54,780
it is right here. Okay. Alright, well have a good one. Thanks for calling. Thanks. Alright.

893
01:05:54,780 --> 01:06:00,180
See you later. Lots and lots of people hammering the line tonight. Let's go to one more call

894
01:06:00,180 --> 01:06:07,400
for now. Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio. Hi, this is GS-191. Hey, GS-191, what's on

895
01:06:07,400 --> 01:06:13,580
your mind? I just want to come on and hold out the Orange Launch Radio Frapper. Yes,

896
01:06:13,580 --> 01:06:18,280
now the Frapper, this was something that you created that you were plugging on the forums.

897
01:06:18,280 --> 01:06:19,040
This is pretty cool.

898
01:06:19,040 --> 01:06:21,480
Tell our listeners about this.

899
01:06:21,480 --> 01:06:27,840
It basically just lets you, you can like, let listeners

900
01:06:27,840 --> 01:06:32,280
like, are you still there?

901
01:06:32,280 --> 01:06:33,680
You cut out for a minute there?

902
01:06:33,680 --> 01:06:35,520
Yeah, yeah, I'm thinking.

903
01:06:35,520 --> 01:06:35,920
Sorry.

904
01:06:35,920 --> 01:06:36,560
That's all right.

905
01:06:36,560 --> 01:06:37,200
Let me help you out.

906
01:06:37,200 --> 01:06:39,200
It looks like something that's based off of

907
01:06:39,200 --> 01:06:40,360
Google Maps or something?

908
01:06:40,360 --> 01:06:41,200
Yes, it is.

909
01:06:41,200 --> 01:06:44,000
So and it allows you to plot points?

910
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:47,720
Yeah, kind of so, but you guys as the listeners can plot

911
01:06:47,720 --> 01:06:50,040
points on this map so we can see where you live.

912
01:06:50,040 --> 01:06:51,960
Yeah, pretty much.

913
01:06:51,960 --> 01:06:52,960
And I'm going to post a link.

914
01:06:52,960 --> 01:06:55,440
Oh, it looks like we both did at the same time there.

915
01:06:55,440 --> 01:06:59,680
Post a link to the official Orange Lounge Radio flapper so you guys should go visit

916
01:06:59,680 --> 01:07:01,840
it and plot yourself on the map.

917
01:07:01,840 --> 01:07:04,640
And that way we can see just where all our listeners are.

918
01:07:04,640 --> 01:07:08,440
And so when we see that we have a lot of listeners in one area, we might have to go, oh, we better

919
01:07:08,440 --> 01:07:11,560
send somebody to a tournament or something, get some coverage out there.

920
01:07:11,560 --> 01:07:12,560
Oh, yeah.

921
01:07:12,560 --> 01:07:13,560
Yeah.

922
01:07:13,560 --> 01:07:15,280
And plus, it's just kind of neat.

923
01:07:15,280 --> 01:07:17,040
It's kind of neat to know where all the listeners are.

924
01:07:17,040 --> 01:07:22,320
And of course, if you go to the Frapper, you can see on there that there's a high concentration

925
01:07:22,320 --> 01:07:25,080
of people in the Sacramento area, which of course makes sense because that's where our

926
01:07:25,080 --> 01:07:26,080
site's based.

927
01:07:26,080 --> 01:07:27,080
I know.

928
01:07:27,080 --> 01:07:30,160
But it's kind of neat to see the dots outside of that.

929
01:07:30,160 --> 01:07:33,200
It's fascinating to see the worldwide appeal this show has.

930
01:07:33,200 --> 01:07:35,320
It's great.

931
01:07:35,320 --> 01:07:38,240
So go add yourself to the Frapper, boys and girls.

932
01:07:38,240 --> 01:07:45,480
And if you're not in the chat room and couldn't get the link, it's www.frappr.com slash orange

933
01:07:45,480 --> 01:07:55,160
Thank you so much for making that and suggesting that, GS-191, and I hope we get tons of people

934
01:07:55,160 --> 01:07:58,760
on it so we can be giddy map people.

935
01:07:58,760 --> 01:07:59,760
I don't know.

936
01:07:59,760 --> 01:08:00,760
All right.

937
01:08:00,760 --> 01:08:01,760
Sure.

938
01:08:01,760 --> 01:08:02,760
Thanks.

939
01:08:02,760 --> 01:08:03,760
Yeah, sure.

940
01:08:03,760 --> 01:08:04,760
All right.

941
01:08:04,760 --> 01:08:05,760
Take care.

942
01:08:05,760 --> 01:08:06,760
Okay.

943
01:08:06,760 --> 01:08:07,760
You too.

944
01:08:07,760 --> 01:08:08,760
Bye.

945
01:08:08,760 --> 01:08:09,760
Bye.

946
01:08:09,760 --> 01:08:10,760
All right.

947
01:08:10,760 --> 01:08:11,760
We're going to go ahead and turn off the Skyblind for now.

948
01:08:11,760 --> 01:08:12,760
We will take more calls a little later on in the program.

949
01:08:12,760 --> 01:08:16,800
I think, at this point, we're going to go ahead and get into the Orange Lounge Radio

950
01:08:16,800 --> 01:08:17,800
Cage Match for tonight.

951
01:08:17,800 --> 01:08:19,800
Does that sound like fun, boys and girls?

952
01:08:19,800 --> 01:08:20,800
We.

953
01:08:20,800 --> 01:08:26,300
Alright, so I've got to get the Cage Match music queued up, but of course we had a retiree

954
01:08:26,300 --> 01:08:30,360
from last week, so we're going to have three brand new songs in tonight's Cage Match.

955
01:08:30,360 --> 01:08:32,760
So tonight's Cage Match is going to take a little more time than usual, because we're

956
01:08:32,760 --> 01:08:35,440
going to have three songs in their entirety.

957
01:08:35,440 --> 01:08:37,440
Let's get it started.

958
01:08:37,440 --> 01:08:41,360
Alright, the way the Orange Lounge Radio Cage Match works is that you have to be in our

959
01:08:41,360 --> 01:08:46,680
chat room at www.orangeloungeradio.com. We are going to play three songs for you and

960
01:08:46,680 --> 01:08:51,880
since there is no reigning champion because we retired last week's winner as it was its

961
01:08:51,880 --> 01:08:56,640
fourth win in a row, that was Pendulum with Hold Your Color, that song was retired, we're

962
01:08:56,640 --> 01:09:02,200
going to play three brand new songs for you in their entirety. So you're going to vote

963
01:09:02,200 --> 01:09:08,680
for your favorite in our chat room at www.orangeloungeradio.com and your favorite songs that you guys vote

964
01:09:08,680 --> 01:09:14,020
We'll go into rotation all week long on Orange Lounge Radio's 24-hour day, 7-day-a-week

965
01:09:14,020 --> 01:09:17,520
Romani and video game music program, which has had a lot of you guys listening to it

966
01:09:17,520 --> 01:09:18,920
lately, so we appreciate that.

967
01:09:18,920 --> 01:09:20,780
All right, so let's get it started.

968
01:09:20,780 --> 01:09:27,640
I guess I will go ahead, since I technically hold your color by pen norm, although it was

969
01:09:27,640 --> 01:09:30,920
technically my pick for the cage match, it wasn't really.

970
01:09:30,920 --> 01:09:34,760
I let somebody else pick that song for me, so I myself have not picked a song for the

971
01:09:34,760 --> 01:09:38,640
cage match for quite a while, so I want to start first, if you guys are okay with that.

972
01:09:38,640 --> 01:09:43,080
And my song tonight is by a group, it's a very famous group, it's a very well-known

973
01:09:43,080 --> 01:09:46,640
group, but not so much over the years, it's kind of cooled down a little bit.

974
01:09:46,640 --> 01:09:50,400
They have a brand new album out, and it's pretty good, I really like the lead single

975
01:09:50,400 --> 01:09:53,760
off the album, so I want to play it for you guys tonight, it's my Cage Match pick.

976
01:09:53,760 --> 01:09:57,680
It's Depeche Mode, and the song is called Precious, and it's my pick for song number

977
01:09:57,680 --> 01:10:04,680
one on tonight's Orange Lounge Cage Match.

978
01:10:27,680 --> 01:10:37,680
My God, what have we done to you?

979
01:10:37,680 --> 01:10:46,680
We always tried to share the tenderest of care

980
01:10:46,680 --> 01:10:55,680
Now look what we have put you through

981
01:10:55,680 --> 01:11:11,680
Things get damaged, things get broken I thought we'd managed, but what left unspoken Left us a prison, there was so little left to do

982
01:11:25,680 --> 01:11:35,680
Angels with silver wings, shouldn't know suffering

983
01:11:35,680 --> 01:11:44,680
I wish I could take the pain for you

984
01:11:44,680 --> 01:11:54,680
If God has a master plan, then only He understands

985
01:11:54,680 --> 01:11:58,680
I hope it's your eyes you see

986
01:12:03,680 --> 01:12:08,680
Things get damaged, things get broken

987
01:12:08,680 --> 01:12:12,680
I thought we panicked, but words left unspoken

988
01:12:12,680 --> 01:12:19,680
Left us to pretend, there was no reason left to give

989
01:12:42,680 --> 01:13:02,680
I pray you learn to trust Have faith in both of us

990
01:13:02,680 --> 01:13:05,680
In your thoughts for two

991
01:13:10,680 --> 01:13:14,680
Things get damaged, things get broken

992
01:13:14,680 --> 01:13:19,680
I thought we'd met, but words left unspoken

993
01:13:19,680 --> 01:13:26,680
Left us a prison, there was no answer left to give

994
01:13:49,680 --> 01:14:07,160
Alright, that was song number one in tonight's cage match, that was Depeche Mode with Precious.

995
01:14:07,160 --> 01:14:10,560
Was that song the precious, or was that song the crappy?

996
01:14:10,560 --> 01:14:12,480
Our judges in the studio will let you know.

997
01:14:12,480 --> 01:14:13,480
Dark Sakura.

998
01:14:13,480 --> 01:14:18,240
I haven't really cared for anything Depeche Mode's done since the 80's, because as I'm

999
01:14:18,240 --> 01:14:23,920
you know prone to calling them depressed about yeah there's a little emo

1000
01:14:25,800 --> 01:14:31,960
it's very sedate it actually reminds me of actually some of the stuff from

1001
01:14:31,960 --> 01:14:38,920
Silent Hill 3 along the same lines I like it a lot as listening it gets a 10

1002
01:14:38,920 --> 01:14:43,240
for cage magic it's an 8 okay it is a little emo I'll go ahead and do my

1003
01:14:43,240 --> 01:14:47,840
ranking it is a little emo and a little sad for cage match but um I just I'm

1004
01:14:47,840 --> 01:14:52,840
I'm in a chill mood lately, where I'm in an emo mood, I guess. I'll admit it. I could be emo once in a while.

1005
01:14:52,840 --> 01:14:56,840
So I give that song an 8 as well. It's fun. Loki.

1006
01:14:56,840 --> 01:15:04,840
Now, I was going to say, Depression was kind of going the way of Crystal Method, where their last album sucked.

1007
01:15:04,840 --> 01:15:08,840
Crystal Method's last album sucked, but the one before it was really good.

1008
01:15:08,840 --> 01:15:16,840
And if this is one of the best songs on the album, then I'm kind of leery because I really did like Exciter.

1009
01:15:16,840 --> 01:15:29,840
Cider. That was one of my favorite Depeche Mode albums. And this one, it's okay, but I have to listen to the rest of it before I can make my judgment on the whole thing, but I give it an 8. It's pretty good. It's just Depeche Mode can't really do wrong, so...

1010
01:15:29,840 --> 01:15:34,840
Alright. 8, 8, 8, and now it's Angel's turn. Angel, what do you think?

1011
01:15:34,840 --> 01:15:39,840
It's Depeche Mode. It's cool. Um... 8.

1012
01:15:39,840 --> 01:15:42,840
I somehow knew she'd give it an 8 as well.

1013
01:15:42,840 --> 01:15:44,840
How could you not at that point?

1014
01:15:44,840 --> 01:15:46,840
Alright, 8's across the board for Depeche Mode Precious.

1015
01:15:46,840 --> 01:15:49,840
But remember, it's not up to us to decide.

1016
01:15:49,840 --> 01:15:52,840
Our scores don't mean shit. It's like that game Whose Line is Anyway.

1017
01:15:52,840 --> 01:15:55,840
The scores don't mean shit. It's up to you guys and your votes in the chat room.

1018
01:15:55,840 --> 01:15:58,840
We're just kind of coaxing you into which songs we think.

1019
01:15:58,840 --> 01:16:01,840
I believe that was the first time we've done that across the board actually.

1020
01:16:01,840 --> 01:16:03,840
In a while. I know it's been done before.

1021
01:16:03,840 --> 01:16:05,840
Because I remember sooner or later there was a mix of girls.

1022
01:16:05,840 --> 01:16:11,840
Those are the cage match horns that got like zeroes across the board from everybody, including Loki.

1023
01:16:11,840 --> 01:16:14,840
Anyway, let's go on to the next song, the second song of tonight's cage match.

1024
01:16:14,840 --> 01:16:18,840
We're going to go ahead and do Loki's pick. Loki, what did you pick tonight?

1025
01:16:18,840 --> 01:16:22,840
I picked the song that's off of the CD.

1026
01:16:22,840 --> 01:16:25,840
It's actually pretty cool.

1027
01:16:25,840 --> 01:16:31,840
Kalinda, I've never heard of them before, but they're on one of those compilation trance CDs.

1028
01:16:31,840 --> 01:16:32,840
And it sounded pretty good.

1029
01:16:32,840 --> 01:16:37,880
good it's upbeat short that's all you need to know it's upbeat and short all

1030
01:16:37,880 --> 01:16:40,940
right well we'll be the judges of that here it is song number two in tonight's

1031
01:16:40,940 --> 01:16:47,940
cage match, Kalinda with I'll Surrender.

1032
01:17:10,940 --> 01:17:17,940
All the times you did me wrong

1033
01:17:17,940 --> 01:17:24,940
Reasons wouldn't last for long

1034
01:17:24,940 --> 01:17:31,940
Now I'm feeling alone

1035
01:17:31,940 --> 01:17:37,940
With a shelter aware

1036
01:17:37,940 --> 01:17:46,940
Could I find a way to change your mind If I had a chance to make it right?

1037
01:17:46,940 --> 01:17:53,940
Is there a moment to leave it all behind?

1038
01:17:53,940 --> 01:18:00,940
Could I find a way to lose this pain If I had a chance to call your name?

1039
01:18:00,940 --> 01:18:07,940
I'm surrounded, I'm given a disguise

1040
01:18:07,940 --> 01:18:14,940
Oh, that you did me wrong

1041
01:18:14,940 --> 01:18:21,940
Preaching for the love of love

1042
01:18:21,940 --> 01:18:28,940
Now I'm feeling left alone

1043
01:18:28,940 --> 01:18:48,400
I'll surrender, I'll surrender I'm giving up this fight, I'm giving up this

1044
01:18:48,400 --> 01:18:56,400
Oh I surrender, I surrender

1045
01:18:56,400 --> 01:19:02,400
I'm giving up this fight I'm giving up this fight

1046
01:19:02,400 --> 01:19:10,400
Oh I surrender, I surrender

1047
01:19:10,400 --> 01:19:16,560
I'm giving up this fight, I'm giving up this fight

1048
01:19:16,900 --> 01:19:24,000
I'm surrounded, I'm surrendered

1049
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:28,000
I'm giving up this fight

1050
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:31,000
I'm giving up this fight

1051
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:48,000
I won't love you anymore

1052
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:51,000
I won't take it all for sure

1053
01:19:51,000 --> 01:19:58,000
I won't love you anymore And I'll surrender

1054
01:19:58,000 --> 01:20:05,000
I won't die you anymore I won't take it all for sure

1055
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:12,000
I won't love you anymore And I'll surrender

1056
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:41,920
generic I have to admit usually those are types of songs I'm a sucker for and

1057
01:20:41,920 --> 01:20:44,960
there was some lovely instrumentation in that song and the woman did have a

1058
01:20:44,960 --> 01:20:50,400
pretty voice but I'm just I'm too emo for that song tonight I really am in an

1059
01:20:50,400 --> 01:20:54,240
emo mood today so I can't appreciate that song as much as I should so I have

1060
01:20:54,240 --> 01:20:59,860
to give it like a six I'm very sorry Loki Loki it gets an eight and ironically

1061
01:20:59,860 --> 01:21:06,860
enough that the amount of Mac sim files have been posted by myself since they've relaunched.

1062
01:21:06,860 --> 01:21:12,860
Beautiful. All right, Angel, what did you think of I'll Surrender?

1063
01:21:12,860 --> 01:21:18,860
It was okay. Seven and a half.

1064
01:21:18,860 --> 01:21:23,860
Seven and a half from Angel. Okay, song number three tonight is Dark Sakura's Pick.

1065
01:21:23,860 --> 01:21:25,860
Dark Sakura, what did you choose for us?

1066
01:21:25,860 --> 01:21:28,860
Only by Nine Inch Nails, just because.

1067
01:21:28,860 --> 01:21:29,860
Just because?

1068
01:21:29,860 --> 01:21:31,860
Yeah, I've been in the mood.

1069
01:21:31,860 --> 01:21:34,860
Is this like one of their hard-hitting industrial songs, or is this kind of a...

1070
01:21:34,860 --> 01:21:35,860
You'll find out.

1071
01:21:35,860 --> 01:21:38,860
Oh, snap. Okay, we will. Here we go.

1072
01:21:38,860 --> 01:21:41,860
Well, song number three is Nine Inch Nails with Only.

1073
01:22:08,860 --> 01:22:36,480
I'm becoming less defined as days go by Fading away, well you might say I'm losing

1074
01:22:36,480 --> 01:22:40,480
Focus, kind of drifting in the abstract

1075
01:22:40,480 --> 01:22:43,480
In terms of how I see myself

1076
01:22:43,480 --> 01:22:47,480
Sometimes I think I can see right through myself

1077
01:22:47,480 --> 01:22:52,480
Sometimes I think I can see right through myself

1078
01:22:52,480 --> 01:22:57,480
Sometimes I can see right through myself

1079
01:22:57,480 --> 01:23:01,480
Less concerned about fitting into the world

1080
01:23:01,480 --> 01:23:03,480
Your world that is

1081
01:23:03,480 --> 01:23:10,480
Cause it doesn't really matter, though it doesn't really matter, though it doesn't really matter anymore

1082
01:23:10,480 --> 01:23:14,480
None of this really matters anymore

1083
01:23:20,480 --> 01:23:24,480
This time alone, then again I always was

1084
01:23:24,480 --> 01:23:28,480
As far back as I can tell, I think maybe it's because

1085
01:23:28,480 --> 01:23:31,480
Because we were never really real

1086
01:23:31,480 --> 01:23:54,480
And when I just wake you up, I just wake you up to hurt myself

1087
01:23:54,480 --> 01:23:56,480
And who works?

1088
01:23:57,480 --> 01:23:58,680
If you destruction

1089
01:23:58,680 --> 01:24:00,580
There is no you

1090
01:24:00,580 --> 01:24:02,480
There is only me

1091
01:24:03,480 --> 01:24:05,060
There is no you

1092
01:24:05,420 --> 01:24:06,980
There is only me

1093
01:24:07,220 --> 01:24:08,480
There is no fucking you

1094
01:24:09,480 --> 01:24:10,480
There is only me

1095
01:24:10,880 --> 01:24:12,480
There is no fucking you

1096
01:24:13,480 --> 01:24:14,980
There is only me

1097
01:24:19,480 --> 01:24:19,980
Only

1098
01:24:20,480 --> 01:24:21,980
Only

1099
01:24:21,980 --> 01:24:36,980
Well the tiniest little dot caught my eye and it turned out to be a stab

1100
01:24:36,980 --> 01:24:41,980
And I had this funny feeling like I just knew it's something bad

1101
01:24:41,980 --> 01:24:46,980
I just couldn't leave you picking up the scale

1102
01:24:46,980 --> 01:24:51,980
There's a doorway trying to see that you're so shy

1103
01:24:51,980 --> 01:24:54,980
But I'm climbing up

1104
01:24:54,980 --> 01:24:58,980
Now I'm somewhere I don't have to have to be

1105
01:24:58,980 --> 01:25:02,980
And I can see things I know I really should have seen

1106
01:25:02,980 --> 01:25:06,980
And now I know why, now I know why

1107
01:26:06,980 --> 01:26:14,980
Alright fellas, sorry I'm laughing because they're having this soda versus pop debate

1108
01:26:14,980 --> 01:26:15,980
in chat.

1109
01:26:15,980 --> 01:26:16,980
We'll get to that in a minute.

1110
01:26:16,980 --> 01:26:20,980
For now, let's review song number three, Nine Inch Nails with Only.

1111
01:26:20,980 --> 01:26:26,980
Is that the only song for you, or is that a song you would like to, I don't know, equiv-

1112
01:26:26,980 --> 01:26:28,980
uh, equiv-late to Nine Inch Nails on a chalkboard?

1113
01:26:28,980 --> 01:26:29,980
That's awesome.

1114
01:26:29,980 --> 01:26:30,980
Careful there.

1115
01:26:30,980 --> 01:26:31,980
Yep, gotta turn it.

1116
01:26:31,980 --> 01:26:32,980
He's a piece of shit.

1117
01:26:32,980 --> 01:26:34,980
Careful there, yep, gotta turn it.

1118
01:26:34,980 --> 01:26:35,980
He's a piece of shit.

1119
01:26:35,980 --> 01:26:36,980
I know, weird mic tone.

1120
01:26:36,980 --> 01:26:42,980
That song just, it's got the, that emphasis it didn't normally do, but it's a lot more laid back.

1121
01:26:42,980 --> 01:26:45,980
Probably gets me a date from me.

1122
01:26:45,980 --> 01:26:49,980
You know, it's not the usual Nine Inch Nails song, and if I was in a normal mood,

1123
01:26:49,980 --> 01:26:52,980
I would probably penalize the song for not sounding like a normal Nine Inch Nails song.

1124
01:26:52,980 --> 01:26:58,980
However, it fits my emo mood, therefore it gets a bonus point, and I give it a nine.

1125
01:26:58,980 --> 01:27:04,980
Loki, I am in a normal mood and I'm going to penalize it for not being a normal Nine Inch Nails song.

1126
01:27:04,980 --> 01:27:06,980
It gets a five.

1127
01:27:06,980 --> 01:27:08,980
Alright.

1128
01:27:08,980 --> 01:27:13,980
Angel has left the room momentarily, but we would assume that she would give it, like, a ten.

1129
01:27:13,980 --> 01:27:16,980
Well, yeah, she gave everything else an eight tonight. Oh, there's Angel.

1130
01:27:16,980 --> 01:27:20,980
What would you give that song, Nine Inch Nails only?

1131
01:27:20,980 --> 01:27:22,980
Uh, eight!

1132
01:27:22,980 --> 01:27:24,980
See, there you go, have an eight.

1133
01:27:24,980 --> 01:27:27,780
But remember, it's not up to us, it's up to you.

1134
01:27:27,780 --> 01:27:29,980
Here are the three songs you can vote for tonight.

1135
01:27:29,980 --> 01:27:32,380
A quick recap in tonight's Cage Match.

1136
01:27:32,380 --> 01:27:34,680
Three brand new songs, no returning champions.

1137
01:27:34,680 --> 01:27:36,780

1142
01:28:14,520 --> 01:28:19,440
Song number one, Calienda, song number two, or Nine Inch Nails, song number three.

1143
01:28:19,440 --> 01:28:20,440
Do it.

1144
01:28:20,440 --> 01:28:21,440
Do it now.

1145
01:28:21,440 --> 01:28:22,440
All the cool kids are doing it.

1146
01:28:22,440 --> 01:28:27,320
And if you don't, you are going to get a massive wedgie from all of us.

1147
01:28:27,320 --> 01:28:32,540
Loki, what's going on in the sim scene, dare I ask, in the Dance Dance Revolution and other

1148
01:28:32,540 --> 01:28:34,760
music gaming simulation?

1149
01:28:34,760 --> 01:28:40,280
As I mentioned before with the eight brand new Max remixes, not much as far as the sim

1150
01:28:40,280 --> 01:28:47,280
goes on my cell, or at least all the submissions, but there is another tournament going on.

1151
01:28:47,280 --> 01:28:56,280
Since TourneyMix is gone for good, hopefully, we have OSC 4, or the Original Step File Competition,

1152
01:28:56,280 --> 01:29:07,280
4. And basically the rules are a little bit different than TourneyMix, and basically the

1153
01:29:07,280 --> 01:29:18,280
The main stuff is, let's see here, basically the staff can't enter, which is probably good

1154
01:29:18,280 --> 01:29:21,280
because why would they be voting on their own songs?

1155
01:29:21,280 --> 01:29:29,280
But anyways, there's going to be one, I don't know, it looks exactly the same to me.

1156
01:29:29,280 --> 01:29:33,280
To be honest, they have different divisions, DDR, in the groove, and keyboard.

1157
01:29:33,280 --> 01:29:41,560
So I'm guessing playable, not quite playable, and not playable would be those three categories.

1158
01:29:41,560 --> 01:29:48,480
And it doesn't really say when the submissions are due yet, but let's see.

1159
01:29:48,480 --> 01:29:49,480
My mistake.

1160
01:29:49,480 --> 01:29:51,800
November 13th is when it's up.

1161
01:29:51,800 --> 01:29:54,600
So you said that Turnamix is gone forever?

1162
01:29:54,600 --> 01:29:55,600
Supposedly.

1163
01:29:55,600 --> 01:30:06,740
There is no public voting, so basically it's just by panel review. The public though can

1164
01:30:06,740 --> 01:30:12,800
post the reviews for the songs in each division when they're released and rank it. The average

1165
01:30:12,800 --> 01:30:18,700
score from the public review is then taken and will make up 50% of the song's final division

1166
01:30:18,700 --> 01:30:26,740
score. So, and hopefully, hopefully, they will post, or they won't post, who the song

1167
01:30:26,740 --> 01:30:34,440
is made by. You know, they make it fair, but I don't think that's gonna happen. So yeah,

1168
01:30:34,440 --> 01:30:41,140
that's about it. Other than Dance Tracks, a new StepMania-based game making its way

1169
01:30:41,140 --> 01:30:49,100
to the web, and of course, hopefully pretty soon, the arcades. No real details on it at

1170
01:30:49,100 --> 01:30:54,420
all, other than the fact that you've got, you know, people like D.M. Ashura, Beat Drop,

1171
01:30:54,420 --> 01:31:03,260
and just other people doing music for it. So, it'll be interesting. That's it.

1172
01:31:03,260 --> 01:31:08,620
Alright. Moving on, DarkSakura, I know you were surfing the web a little bit there in

1173
01:31:08,620 --> 01:31:13,020
the background, and you found some pictures from an upcoming movie that we're very excited

1174
01:31:13,020 --> 01:31:14,020
about.

1175
01:31:14,020 --> 01:31:16,020
I thought maybe you wanted to share this with our listeners.

1176
01:31:16,020 --> 01:31:17,020
Oh, yeah.

1177
01:31:17,020 --> 01:31:22,820
Silent Hill movie images up on IGN, one of our listeners linked it on our website, on

1178
01:31:22,820 --> 01:31:23,820
our forums.

1179
01:31:23,820 --> 01:31:32,900
Anyone who was basically naysaying, if these images are any type of indication, it is Silent

1180
01:31:32,900 --> 01:31:33,900
Hill.

1181
01:31:33,900 --> 01:31:34,900
It's official.

1182
01:31:34,900 --> 01:31:36,900
Very, very perfect.

1183
01:31:38,900 --> 01:31:43,900
Down to the environment, down to the...

1184
01:31:43,900 --> 01:31:46,900
Even the colors the characters are dressed in.

1185
01:31:47,900 --> 01:31:50,900
Even the colors that the characters are dressed in is very somber.

1186
01:31:50,900 --> 01:31:52,900
It completely matches the style.

1187
01:31:52,900 --> 01:31:54,900
I'm very excited after seeing the pictures.

1188
01:31:54,900 --> 01:31:56,900
It looks like they're going to get it right.

1189
01:31:56,900 --> 01:31:58,900
I'm so excited that they might get a video game movie right.

1190
01:31:58,900 --> 01:32:01,900
I'm just elated, so I'm very, very happy about that.

1191
01:32:01,900 --> 01:32:04,900
Of course, then again, the Mortal Kombat pictures were cool when I first saw them, too.

1192
01:32:04,900 --> 01:32:05,900
But I have hope.

1193
01:32:05,900 --> 01:32:09,900
These three can look like they're from the game, only, like, better quality, of course.

1194
01:32:09,900 --> 01:32:14,900
And in other news, during the Saw II of the previews, they played Blood Range,

1195
01:32:14,900 --> 01:32:16,900
which I yelled out in the middle of the audience,

1196
01:32:16,900 --> 01:32:18,900
A MOVIE FUCKING SUCKS!

1197
01:32:18,900 --> 01:32:20,900
Everyone laughed.

1198
01:32:20,900 --> 01:32:23,900
I need to see Doom so I can laugh at it.

1199
01:32:23,900 --> 01:32:26,900
I think Doom has already fallen out of the top ten movies.

1200
01:32:26,900 --> 01:32:28,900
It's gone.

1201
01:32:28,900 --> 01:32:34,380
and made, I think, like half of its budget back, if even that.

1202
01:32:34,380 --> 01:32:38,600
Let's see, and what else? Oh, did you guys hear this week what movie

1203
01:32:38,600 --> 01:32:45,220
has got a push to be made now? A video game movie was licensed out and now

1204
01:32:45,220 --> 01:32:48,100
has a directory attached and the script's being written for?

1205
01:32:48,100 --> 01:32:51,680
Castlevania. Castlevania's being turned into a movie.

1206
01:32:51,680 --> 01:32:53,900
It's got to be done right, that's all I think.

1207
01:32:53,900 --> 01:32:57,300
Well, here's who's attached to direct. I believe his name is Paul Anderson.

1208
01:32:57,300 --> 01:32:59,780
he was the guy that did Mortal Kombat and Resident Evil.

1209
01:32:59,780 --> 01:33:03,780
Well now, Mortal Kombat was a good movie, and Resident Evil was a good movie.

1210
01:33:03,780 --> 01:33:07,260
Well, I liked Resident Evil, shut up.

1211
01:33:07,260 --> 01:33:08,260
They were fun.

1212
01:33:08,260 --> 01:33:09,260
I'll give it that.

1213
01:33:09,260 --> 01:33:11,260
They weren't Oscar caliber movies, but they were fun.

1214
01:33:11,260 --> 01:33:13,260
Mortal Kombat, I think, was done right.

1215
01:33:13,260 --> 01:33:14,260
They were tolerable.

1216
01:33:14,260 --> 01:33:18,980
You know, when you put them next to a Uwe Boll movie, I mean, honestly, it doesn't look

1217
01:33:18,980 --> 01:33:19,980
that bad.

1218
01:33:19,980 --> 01:33:20,980
They actually are pretty good.

1219
01:33:20,980 --> 01:33:23,940
Mortal Kombat was, you put Mortal Kombat in the movie next to Street Fighter in the movie,

1220
01:33:23,940 --> 01:33:26,700
and it's like, oh, I watched Mortal Kombat like 20 times, seriously.

1221
01:33:26,700 --> 01:33:33,280
So honestly, probably Paul Anderson to date has set the bar for a decent video game movie

1222
01:33:33,280 --> 01:33:34,560
that is yet to be exceeded.

1223
01:33:34,560 --> 01:33:38,120
I don't think there has been a better video game movie than Mortal Kombat or Resident

1224
01:33:38,120 --> 01:33:39,120
Evil.

1225
01:33:39,120 --> 01:33:41,700
I'm quite excited about the Peter Jackson Halo.

1226
01:33:41,700 --> 01:33:46,180
But see, with Silent Hill on deck and Halo, eventually, I think it's going to push the

1227
01:33:46,180 --> 01:33:47,180
bar up.

1228
01:33:47,180 --> 01:33:48,180
I'm hoping.

1229
01:33:48,180 --> 01:33:49,180
I hope so, too.

1230
01:33:49,180 --> 01:33:51,180
And people need to stop making movies.

1231
01:33:51,180 --> 01:33:52,180
Period.

1232
01:33:52,180 --> 01:33:57,500
Of course, we talked about in the last podcast, the Dungeon Siege is going to be two movies

1233
01:33:57,500 --> 01:33:58,500
four hours long.

1234
01:33:58,500 --> 01:33:59,500
Epic.

1235
01:33:59,500 --> 01:34:00,500
Epic.

1236
01:34:00,500 --> 01:34:01,500
It's an epic Yui Bowl event.

1237
01:34:01,500 --> 01:34:05,380
I have not actually seen a Yui Bowl movie yet, just because they're so bad, but I really

1238
01:34:05,380 --> 01:34:11,220
need to sit down so I can nitpick them on particular issues, because I know that just

1239
01:34:11,220 --> 01:34:18,220
the movies overall are really bad and uninspiring and just awful, but I'm kind of curious to

1240
01:34:18,220 --> 01:34:20,460
see BloodRayne, because at least she gets naked.

1241
01:34:20,460 --> 01:34:26,740
So at least they've got that going for it. So yeah, that'd be good.

1242
01:34:26,740 --> 01:34:30,140
No, no, no, I was just... I don't even need it. Bye, bye.

1243
01:34:30,140 --> 01:34:34,020
I thought you were going to comment on something. Weren't you excited about Castlevania, the

1244
01:34:34,020 --> 01:34:36,020
movie, or as I call it, Castlevania?

1245
01:34:36,020 --> 01:34:39,140
Mmm, Simon. Simon?

1246
01:34:39,140 --> 01:34:42,020
Okay. Let's hope to hell they get the right actor

1247
01:34:42,020 --> 01:34:46,260
to play Simon. I know, why don't they just have Hugh Jackman do it again?

1248
01:34:46,260 --> 01:34:48,740
i have an idea how we get

1249
01:34:48,740 --> 01:34:51,340
indies all the place seven belmont

1250
01:34:51,340 --> 01:34:52,620
albino

1251
01:34:52,620 --> 01:34:54,300
well jim carrey is

1252
01:34:54,300 --> 01:34:58,100
so i don't know what you know i'm not not to throw this topic in the gutter

1253
01:34:58,100 --> 01:35:00,720
but vin diesel is a very very big joke

1254
01:35:00,720 --> 01:35:03,760
around where you're going to have a little bit earlier

1255
01:35:03,760 --> 01:35:04,780
whenever

1256
01:35:04,780 --> 01:35:08,460
vin diesel plate or else we're seeing a bit all the characters in the movie

1257
01:35:08,460 --> 01:35:12,780
british apparel as simon belmont

1258
01:35:12,780 --> 01:35:19,780
but

1259
01:35:20,560 --> 01:35:24,140
that never mind

1260
01:35:24,140 --> 01:35:27,900
jigsaw the clown is simon belmont

1261
01:35:27,900 --> 01:35:30,460
anyway

1262
01:35:30,460 --> 01:35:33,460
moving on uh... that should be interesting i'll outlet

1263
01:35:33,460 --> 01:35:35,980
don't know before we go break i want to talk

1264
01:35:35,980 --> 01:35:37,620
about uh...

1265
01:35:37,620 --> 01:35:39,300
xbox three sixty

1266
01:35:39,300 --> 01:35:42,060
and of course i want to bring this up again on the podcast later but all

1267
01:35:42,060 --> 01:35:44,820
Oh, speaking of tonight's podcast, damn, I said I would get this out at some point.

1268
01:35:44,820 --> 01:35:48,460
Tonight's podcast is going to be the winner, because we have not one but two interviews

1269
01:35:48,460 --> 01:35:49,460
on tonight's podcast.

1270
01:35:49,460 --> 01:35:50,460
It's going to be cool.

1271
01:35:50,460 --> 01:35:52,660
We're actually going to be doing a follow-up.

1272
01:35:52,660 --> 01:35:56,700
I don't know if you guys heard about this, but Kings Quest IX, there was this fan project

1273
01:35:56,700 --> 01:36:01,980
going on to create a fan version of Kings Quest, because Vivendi, when they basically

1274
01:36:01,980 --> 01:36:04,880
bought Sierra, said, oh, we're not going to do any more Kings Quest games because nobody

1275
01:36:04,880 --> 01:36:08,900
plays them, which, obviously, because the huge community out there turned out to not

1276
01:36:08,900 --> 01:36:13,080
be true, because there's a great King's Quest community out there, well, they were starting

1277
01:36:13,080 --> 01:36:17,800
to create their own version of King's Quest, King's Quest IX, and Vivendi sent a cease

1278
01:36:17,800 --> 01:36:21,120
and desist to them a couple weeks ago. Well, now there's this huge campaign to save them.

1279
01:36:21,120 --> 01:36:24,560
Tonight's podcast, we're going to be talking to the guy that started one of the biggest

1280
01:36:24,560 --> 01:36:28,700
websites out there about the campaign, and we're going to be talking to the project director

1281
01:36:28,700 --> 01:36:35,680
behind King's Quest IX, the fan version. So it should be very interesting, KQIX, as they

1282
01:36:35,680 --> 01:36:40,200
call it for short, so tune into that. But also, this is something I probably will address

1283
01:36:40,200 --> 01:36:43,920
on the podcast as well, but I have to bring this up on the live show because I get more

1284
01:36:43,920 --> 01:36:49,240
time to rant here than I do on the podcast, and that's to do with Xbox 360. Now, Loki,

1285
01:36:49,240 --> 01:36:51,560
you were saying that you're going to be getting yours on launch day.

1286
01:36:51,560 --> 01:36:57,000
Well, every day I kind of question that more and more just because of what Microsoft's

1287
01:36:57,000 --> 01:37:06,320
doing their trickling in the allocations, so it's like, okay, X-Store, you had 200 Xboxes,

1288
01:37:06,320 --> 01:37:09,320
thank you for pre-selling all of this, we're going to send you 10. You know, or like, you

1289
01:37:09,320 --> 01:37:14,340
know, stuff like that. It's just really ridiculous. The store I booked mine at is not as busy

1290
01:37:14,340 --> 01:37:20,120
as the other store that I used to, the GameStop I used to pre-book stuff at was in the mall,

1291
01:37:20,120 --> 01:37:24,400
you know, a high-traffic GameStop and stuff, and it was a bitch and a half to try to get

1292
01:37:24,400 --> 01:37:30,000
anything from them. So now I've booked stuff now at the GameStop that's only a couple blocks

1293
01:37:30,000 --> 01:37:34,400
from my house. It's really small. There's never really anyone in there and that type

1294
01:37:34,400 --> 01:37:39,640
of stuff. So I'm hoping that there's not that many people that have booked them, and I got

1295
01:37:39,640 --> 01:37:45,120
in on one of the few that they've got. But even like some of the stores that hardly have

1296
01:37:45,120 --> 01:37:52,080
any orders for them, they're not getting hardly anything. So it's really iffy. Hopefully I

1297
01:37:52,080 --> 01:37:57,000
I am because I've got two games on order there and two on order at my work, and so I'm really

1298
01:37:57,000 --> 01:38:01,120
trying to get a lot of this stuff in, plus I'm trying to butter up the people we sell

1299
01:38:01,120 --> 01:38:06,360
to, the publishers, to have them send me some free stuff, but that's a whole other story.

1300
01:38:06,360 --> 01:38:07,360
But yeah.

1301
01:38:07,360 --> 01:38:10,120
You know, I got to play an Xbox 360 kiosk finally.

1302
01:38:10,120 --> 01:38:11,120
What is that?

1303
01:38:11,120 --> 01:38:16,480
Best Buy has them, two of them in the area have the kiosk set up, the one over by Birdcage

1304
01:38:16,480 --> 01:38:19,800
has one, that's where I played it yesterday.

1305
01:38:19,800 --> 01:38:25,120
And they have demos of Cameo and Call of Duty 2.

1306
01:38:25,120 --> 01:38:26,120
And King Kong?

1307
01:38:26,120 --> 01:38:27,120
No, just those two.

1308
01:38:27,120 --> 01:38:29,520
Or at least those two were the ones I noticed that were playable.

1309
01:38:29,520 --> 01:38:31,320
I know they had videos of a bunch of other ones too.

1310
01:38:31,320 --> 01:38:33,400
I don't remember King Kong's playable usually.

1311
01:38:33,400 --> 01:38:36,040
But it might be a different disc, who knows?

1312
01:38:36,040 --> 01:38:37,680
Yeah, I just missed it completely.

1313
01:38:37,680 --> 01:38:40,680
But I did notice specifically those two games were playable.

1314
01:38:40,680 --> 01:38:44,480
And I have to say I was incredibly underwhelmed with Cameo.

1315
01:38:44,480 --> 01:38:46,360
Cameo was the one I really paid attention to.

1316
01:38:46,360 --> 01:38:51,260
Call of Duty 2 had pretty graphics and stuff, but Cameo was a little bit underwhelming.

1317
01:38:51,260 --> 01:38:56,100
I can see where people are making these Xbox 1.5 comparisons, where it just looks slightly

1318
01:38:56,100 --> 01:38:57,100
better than the Xbox.

1319
01:38:57,100 --> 01:38:58,660
It's not much better.

1320
01:38:58,660 --> 01:39:01,900
I'm surprised because Cameo was actually one of the ones I was pretty impressed with.

1321
01:39:01,900 --> 01:39:05,500
All the first party stuff seemed to be pretty good, and Cameo was one of them.

1322
01:39:05,500 --> 01:39:10,140
I don't know if maybe the particular level or the sub that they have is not very forgiving

1323
01:39:10,140 --> 01:39:14,540
to the game, but the one that we saw, they were showing kind of like the draw distance

1324
01:39:14,540 --> 01:39:19,540
of the game and stuff and there was like hundreds and thousands of like these creatures just

1325
01:39:19,540 --> 01:39:24,880
battling on this field and then she rides this horse up into this entire like volcano

1326
01:39:24,880 --> 01:39:28,860
type thing and looks down and you can see everybody fighting down below and just like

1327
01:39:28,860 --> 01:39:30,660
really detailed.

1328
01:39:30,660 --> 01:39:36,100
It looked really good and it's kind of like a Zelda type game and now with Elder Scrolls

1329
01:39:36,100 --> 01:39:40,780
being pushed to next year now, it's the only RPG that's going to be out there.

1330
01:39:40,780 --> 01:39:46,980
It's more of an action adventure game, I think, like Zelda, more than an RPG.

1331
01:39:46,980 --> 01:39:52,160
But more and more games keep moving, so it's tough.

1332
01:39:52,160 --> 01:39:55,380
It's definitely going to be interesting come launch day.

1333
01:39:55,380 --> 01:39:56,460
The jury's out now for me.

1334
01:39:56,460 --> 01:40:01,020
I was completely sold on Xbox 360 and I wanted to pick one up on launch day, but now I'm

1335
01:40:01,020 --> 01:40:03,140
not so sure I want to get one on launch day.

1336
01:40:03,140 --> 01:40:08,340
I don't know if I want to fight those crowds and stuff, so we'll see how that goes.

1337
01:40:08,340 --> 01:40:11,380
It's going to kind of depend on what mood I'm in that day, but after spending $70 on

1338
01:40:11,380 --> 01:40:15,700
Guitar Hero, I don't know if I want to spend another $400 on an Xbox, so we'll see.

1339
01:40:15,700 --> 01:40:20,020
Anyway, somebody in chat room asked me very nicely if they could call in because they

1340
01:40:20,020 --> 01:40:24,220
had a story related to what we're talking about right now, so I said, okay, I'll make

1341
01:40:24,220 --> 01:40:25,220
an exception.

1342
01:40:25,220 --> 01:40:26,220
So who do we have on the line?

1343
01:40:26,220 --> 01:40:27,220
Hi, it's Sephiroth1215 here.

1344
01:40:27,220 --> 01:40:28,220
Hello, Sephiroth1215.

1345
01:40:28,220 --> 01:40:33,620
Now, what did you want to say in regards to Xbox 360?

1346
01:40:33,620 --> 01:40:37,780
I actually said briefly in the chat room before, but no related response, I don't even know

1347
01:40:37,780 --> 01:40:41,220
people are paying attention but we're trying to stay on top of it but we also

1348
01:40:41,220 --> 01:40:44,400
enjoy listening to ourselves talk so it's kind of hard to stay on top of it

1349
01:40:44,400 --> 01:40:49,000
sometimes I think I saw it good but yeah I actually just went by a

1350
01:40:49,000 --> 01:40:52,360
Toys R Us today and I was able to reserve one guaranteed to get in a 20

1351
01:40:52,360 --> 01:40:56,560
second when did Toys R Us start doing reserves that's the point everybody

1352
01:40:56,560 --> 01:41:00,640
forgot about Toys R Us that's why I keep saying go to Toys R Us go to Target and

1353
01:41:00,640 --> 01:41:03,600
stuff like that because no one remembers about Toys R Us but Target doesn't do

1354
01:41:03,600 --> 01:41:07,120
I know, but they're going to get their games in.

1355
01:41:07,120 --> 01:41:10,960
See, the systems are going to be in at Target, you have to be there at six in the morning,

1356
01:41:10,960 --> 01:41:15,240
and they're basically going to go out there, it's first come first serve, the first people

1357
01:41:15,240 --> 01:41:20,080
in line or whatever get this card that, you know, entitles them to buy the system, and

1358
01:41:20,080 --> 01:41:23,960
then, you know, they keep doing it until it's sold out, and that's it.

1359
01:41:23,960 --> 01:41:28,920
See, okay, Loki, tell me, why should I buy an Xbox 360?

1360
01:41:28,920 --> 01:41:29,920
Why?

1361
01:41:29,920 --> 01:41:33,920
Why do I need one in two weeks or whenever the damn thing's coming out?

1362
01:41:33,920 --> 01:41:37,800
Well, personally, like me, I'm a consumer whore and I have to get it right when it comes

1363
01:41:37,800 --> 01:41:39,200
out.

1364
01:41:39,200 --> 01:41:43,240
Just mainly the reason why I want to get it so I can review this stuff right, you know,

1365
01:41:43,240 --> 01:41:48,880
kind of try to get an edge, you know, on everything because I know we're not IGN, we're not GameSpot

1366
01:41:48,880 --> 01:41:53,660
or anything like that, and so having this console now as opposed to two months from

1367
01:41:53,660 --> 01:41:57,780
now is important to me, so I need to get that stuff.

1368
01:41:57,780 --> 01:42:03,840
The other thing is, also, with the date of the PlayStation 3 kind of up in the air, the

1369
01:42:03,840 --> 01:42:08,260
next system that we know is going to launch is going to be in June, which is the revolution.

1370
01:42:08,260 --> 01:42:14,380
That's almost seven months away. I don't want to wait seven months, so I got to do that.

1371
01:42:14,380 --> 01:42:15,980
And also, Burnout is coming out in March, so...

1372
01:42:15,980 --> 01:42:20,940
Oh, yeah. There's the real answer. Okay. All right. So, how much did they make you put

1373
01:42:20,940 --> 01:42:23,980
down at Toys R Us for the Xbox 360?

1374
01:42:23,980 --> 01:42:30,980
50, but the problem is you have to get a bundle. So you have to get the, not the core, but

1375
01:42:31,700 --> 01:42:36,960
the, um, I keep forgetting the name, there's core and there's... Just Xbox 360. The plus,

1376
01:42:36,960 --> 01:42:41,840
the plus pack or what? Just Xbox 360. Hold on, I mean, of course you have to get the

1377
01:42:41,840 --> 01:42:45,360
premium version, which is alright anyway, because that's going to be the harder one

1378
01:42:45,360 --> 01:42:51,760
to find, and cores are going to be probably pretty easy, but still... Wait, are they making

1379
01:42:51,760 --> 01:42:53,880
you get games with it too?

1380
01:42:53,880 --> 01:42:55,440
Yeah.

1381
01:42:55,440 --> 01:42:59,320
I heard a rumor about this now. Wasn't there something on Slash Thought about how Microsoft

1382
01:42:59,320 --> 01:43:03,320
was like forcing retailers to make sure people walk out the door with two games or something

1383
01:43:03,320 --> 01:43:04,320
like that?

1384
01:43:04,320 --> 01:43:06,760
Well, you're going to have to because in order for them to be guaranteed to get them in,

1385
01:43:06,760 --> 01:43:11,120
they have to guarantee that they're going to do ten million dollars with Microsoft in

1386
01:43:11,120 --> 01:43:17,760
like I want to say the next year or in the next few months. So, ten million dollars,

1387
01:43:17,760 --> 01:43:21,000
you're going to have to push those games like big time.

1388
01:43:21,000 --> 01:43:28,000
Honestly, the more and more I hear, the less and less I want to support this system on the launch day, because I don't like their tactics.

1389
01:43:28,000 --> 01:43:36,000
I realize it's all business, and it's just trying to make money and stuff, and trying to sell as many as they can before Christmas, but honestly, there's got to be a better way of doing that.

1390
01:43:36,000 --> 01:43:40,000
The whole thing is, though, is they're trickling them out so they can say, oh yeah, it sold out on the first day.

1391
01:43:40,000 --> 01:43:44,000
Well, yeah, if you put out half the amount that you're supposed to put out, of course it's going to sell out, morons.

1392
01:43:44,000 --> 01:43:48,000
But the gamer community is well aware of what Microsoft's trying to play with us.

1393
01:43:48,000 --> 01:43:52,920
consumer does not and follow the game industry and they don't know better the

1394
01:43:52,920 --> 01:43:55,800
average consumer is not to be waiting at six o'clock in the morning after the

1395
01:43:55,800 --> 01:43:59,320
target when they're out there he wants to get his fucking xbox 360 for

1396
01:43:59,320 --> 01:44:02,080
christmas you better damn well believe people are gonna be waiting in line for

1397
01:44:02,080 --> 01:44:05,440
these things are fighting over they look at tickle meal no that thing is fucking

1398
01:44:05,440 --> 01:44:10,120
retarded but people went out and bottom gotten riots it's retarded but that's

1399
01:44:10,120 --> 01:44:16,000
that that's what it is it's the item for christmas that everybody must have and

1400
01:44:16,000 --> 01:44:26,000
And Microsoft wants to be that item, but what's funny enough is that actually it's the number two item for a Christmas iPod Nano being the top Christmas item right now.

1401
01:44:26,000 --> 01:44:30,000
Also, again, more reason why Apple should get into the gaming market in one way or another.

1402
01:44:30,000 --> 01:44:34,000
Yeah, because you know, they're really known for gaming and they're PC's.

1403
01:44:34,000 --> 01:44:38,000
If Apple and Nintendo teamed up, I swear to God, it would be a force to beat.

1404
01:44:38,000 --> 01:44:43,000
Apple and Nintendo, if they teamed up, they're the masters of getting people to buy the same shit over.

1405
01:44:43,000 --> 01:44:45,000
I mean, look at what Apple just fucking did.

1406
01:44:45,000 --> 01:44:46,400
They released an iPod and then they said,

1407
01:44:46,400 --> 01:44:48,200
no, no, no, no, you gotta have an iPod color.

1408
01:44:48,200 --> 01:44:50,000
No, no, no, no, no, you gotta have an iPod Shuffle.

1409
01:44:50,000 --> 01:44:51,120
No, no, no, wait, an iPod Nano.

1410
01:44:51,120 --> 01:44:52,840
No, no, no, no, wait, we got one that plays videos.

1411
01:44:52,840 --> 01:44:54,280
They're playing Nintendo.

1412
01:44:54,280 --> 01:44:57,160
Exactly, Apple and Nintendo, a match made in heaven.

1413
01:44:57,160 --> 01:44:59,160
Tell me it shouldn't happen.

1414
01:44:59,160 --> 01:45:00,000
I agree.

1415
01:45:00,000 --> 01:45:00,840
It should.

1416
01:45:00,840 --> 01:45:03,720
Okay, sorry, Sephiroth, we're just making you listen

1417
01:45:03,720 --> 01:45:05,600
to our rants there, but.

1418
01:45:05,600 --> 01:45:06,440
That's all right.

1419
01:45:06,440 --> 01:45:08,800
I think Loki's pretty much completely right

1420
01:45:08,800 --> 01:45:10,400
on this one, though.

1421
01:45:10,400 --> 01:45:17,400
Yeah, I hate to say it, but I know Loki's right on this one, but it just doesn't piss me off any less, though.

1422
01:45:18,720 --> 01:45:22,880
Yeah, we'll see what you mean, but us gamers have to get it when we can anyway, so...

1423
01:45:22,880 --> 01:45:26,040
I know. Anything else you want to share with our listeners?

1424
01:45:26,040 --> 01:45:29,360
Uh, yeah. I mean,

1425
01:45:29,360 --> 01:45:32,780
I realize getting a bundle isn't too bad, because

1426
01:45:32,780 --> 01:45:35,080
even with the games that it's coming with,

1427
01:45:35,080 --> 01:45:39,680
it's three games, and I could just go back to another towards Drus,

1428
01:45:39,680 --> 01:45:42,880
or go to a Walmart and return for credit

1429
01:45:42,880 --> 01:45:45,940
without a receipt, so it's not too bad. Now that's thinking.

1430
01:45:45,940 --> 01:45:49,120
I like the way this guy thinks. Smart idea. If you don't want to have to buy these,

1431
01:45:49,120 --> 01:45:52,280
forced to buy these games or whatever, then just buy them and take them back to another

1432
01:45:52,280 --> 01:45:53,040
store.

1433
01:45:53,040 --> 01:45:57,080
Beautiful idea. I like it.

1434
01:45:57,080 --> 01:45:59,940
Well, thank you so much for calling in. We're going to try and get past this topic

1435
01:45:59,940 --> 01:46:03,000
soon enough, but we appreciate your perspective in letting us know about

1436
01:46:03,000 --> 01:46:05,160
Toys R Us. That's a good, that's a good

1437
01:46:05,160 --> 01:46:08,840
FYI. And somebody in chat suggested Circuit City, which I think is another good idea.

1438
01:46:08,840 --> 01:46:12,560
everybody forgets about Circuit City and also there's some other places that you'd

1439
01:46:12,560 --> 01:46:16,040
never think to um... book a uh... 360

1440
01:46:16,040 --> 01:46:18,040
that one being Kohl's

1441
01:46:18,040 --> 01:46:22,480
I didn't even know Kohl's carried electronics, let alone having 360s

1442
01:46:22,480 --> 01:46:25,200
Kohl's is one of them um... also

1443
01:46:25,200 --> 01:46:28,520
like I mentioned before Target and Best Buy, Best Buy they're saying is going to have a lot more

1444
01:46:28,520 --> 01:46:29,960
because apparently

1445
01:46:29,960 --> 01:46:34,000
Bill Gates is going to be uh... whoring the Xbox 360 out at one of the best

1446
01:46:34,000 --> 01:46:36,200
spies in Manhattan, that's the rumor

1447
01:46:36,200 --> 01:46:38,920
at least and because of that there's a deal now where they're going to be

1448
01:46:38,920 --> 01:46:42,040
getting a larger allocation over everybody else

1449
01:46:42,040 --> 01:46:45,480
suckin microsoft's cock for more x boxes beautiful

1450
01:46:45,480 --> 01:46:49,960
and uh... basically i just a lot of these no source that everybody forgets

1451
01:46:49,960 --> 01:46:53,760
about just go check them and see if you get three sixty there

1452
01:46:53,760 --> 01:46:57,160
i mean cole's cold i think i got out of there with

1453
01:46:57,160 --> 01:47:04,160
on the next box three sixty and now and new underwear

1454
01:47:04,160 --> 01:47:07,600
But yeah, when I soil my pants at Dead or Alive 4.

1455
01:47:07,600 --> 01:47:09,120
Yes, anything else?

1456
01:47:09,120 --> 01:47:14,080
Honestly, yeah, it will be possible to get one by this launch day, I'm sure, if you just

1457
01:47:14,080 --> 01:47:15,160
try hard enough.

1458
01:47:15,160 --> 01:47:16,480
It's not too hard.

1459
01:47:16,480 --> 01:47:21,340
So I mean, if people rush out to Toys R Us like tomorrow, I'm sure you might be able

1460
01:47:21,340 --> 01:47:26,400
to get one reserved, but there's still going to be quantities.

1461
01:47:26,400 --> 01:47:32,800
And also, I say don't listen to the people at EVR Games because all they ever tell me

1462
01:47:32,800 --> 01:47:37,760
is no you can't go anywhere else. And I took off my money from my reserve at EB today and

1463
01:47:37,760 --> 01:47:41,700
they laughed at me saying you're not going to be able to get it. Because I guess they're

1464
01:47:41,700 --> 01:47:46,060
told that only reserve for them and you're not going to be able to get it is through

1465
01:47:46,060 --> 01:47:47,060
them.

1466
01:47:47,060 --> 01:47:52,760
No, I, they just, you know, a lot of their market is based on pre-sales and stuff so

1467
01:47:52,760 --> 01:47:55,840
I just, you know, I'm kind of surprised they're trying to, they're just doing anything they

1468
01:47:55,840 --> 01:47:57,500
can to get you to keep your pre-sale there.

1469
01:47:57,500 --> 01:48:01,320
I remember EB telling me that I couldn't find a PSP anywhere and then I took my money and

1470
01:48:01,320 --> 01:48:04,520
the best buy and oh hey look there's a stack of 30 of them yeah same thing

1471
01:48:04,520 --> 01:48:08,040
happened with me and the ds so anyway all right we're gonna let you go step

1472
01:48:08,040 --> 01:48:11,320
off but thanks so much for your call okay

1473
01:48:12,120 --> 01:48:15,000
bye okay bye

1474
01:48:15,880 --> 01:48:20,280
all right anyway uh appreciate that call there got us on a little bit of a rant

1475
01:48:20,280 --> 01:48:24,280
about xbox 360 um now this i think is really interesting and loki i saw you

1476
01:48:24,280 --> 01:48:27,960
had this up earlier can you go back to oneup.com and their story about the oh

1477
01:48:27,960 --> 01:48:33,120
oh, you already had it, great, the Xbox 360 versus the Dreamcast, I think this article

1478
01:48:33,120 --> 01:48:41,800
is so hilarious where they compare the Dreamcast, which, you know, Dreamcast, it didn't succeed,

1479
01:48:41,800 --> 01:48:45,360
but it wasn't because it was a bad system, because Dreamcast actually had a lot of good

1480
01:48:45,360 --> 01:48:50,720
stuff on it, Phantasy Star Online was, like, revolutionary, and the little, what was the

1481
01:48:50,720 --> 01:48:56,200
thingy called, the VMU, that could have, like, its own games on it, that stuff was revolutionary,

1482
01:48:56,200 --> 01:48:58,300
But unfortunately the Dreamcast didn't succeed.

1483
01:48:58,300 --> 01:49:02,580
So it's interesting to see them drawing comparisons to the Dreamcast and the Xbox 360.

1484
01:49:02,580 --> 01:49:04,140
So this article is over on 1UP.com.

1485
01:49:04,140 --> 01:49:08,380
Logan, read us like five or so comparisons here between Dreamcast and 360.

1486
01:49:08,380 --> 01:49:12,260
Launched the year before the competition, and that's the same on both.

1487
01:49:12,260 --> 01:49:13,260
Okay.

1488
01:49:13,260 --> 01:49:15,060
Um, let's see here.

1489
01:49:15,060 --> 01:49:19,540
Had a sleek white console following the footsteps of a bulky black console.

1490
01:49:19,540 --> 01:49:22,380
Now, technicality though, my Xbox is green.

1491
01:49:22,380 --> 01:49:26,020
Okay, yeah, but yours, the original one was black, okay.

1492
01:49:26,020 --> 01:49:29,020
The little swirly thing.

1493
01:49:29,020 --> 01:49:32,020
Now that I thought was eerie. The little swirlies.

1494
01:49:32,020 --> 01:49:35,020
Like the Dreamcast had the swirly and the Xbox 360 has the swirly too.

1495
01:49:35,020 --> 01:49:38,020
That is kind of eerie.

1496
01:49:38,020 --> 01:49:40,020
Let's see here. Here's another one.

1497
01:49:40,020 --> 01:49:44,020
Peter Moore spearheading the marketing for both systems.

1498
01:49:44,020 --> 01:49:45,020
That's creepy.

1499
01:49:45,020 --> 01:49:47,020
Let's see here.

1500
01:49:47,020 --> 01:49:53,020
We've also got promise to be an evolutionary system to someday play DVDs.

1501
01:49:53,020 --> 01:49:55,900
promise to be an evolutionary system someday to play

1502
01:49:55,900 --> 01:49:57,700
hd dvds

1503
01:49:57,700 --> 01:50:00,020
interested in our dreamcast

1504
01:50:00,020 --> 01:50:01,220
end up supporting

1505
01:50:01,220 --> 01:50:04,460
dvds eventually didn't know i didn't know they never did now i'm going to get

1506
01:50:04,460 --> 01:50:07,300
you know i'm confusing because you could play vcd's you don't think the internet

1507
01:50:07,300 --> 01:50:08,460
was yet to be

1508
01:50:08,460 --> 01:50:09,460
uh... using it

1509
01:50:09,460 --> 01:50:11,820
and then of course you know one of my favorites is

1510
01:50:11,820 --> 01:50:15,660
for the dreamcast miller saw a two trailer so much of its next generation

1511
01:50:15,660 --> 01:50:18,060
thunder and then for the access three sixty

1512
01:50:18,060 --> 01:50:22,380
miller saw four trailer so much of its next generation thunder

1513
01:50:22,380 --> 01:50:24,020
it'll be interesting to see what happens

1514
01:50:24,020 --> 01:50:26,780
but then they go into another now there's a spin-off article now it's not

1515
01:50:26,780 --> 01:50:29,940
all you know they're they're not trying to say xbox 360 is going to be

1516
01:50:29,940 --> 01:50:30,980
definitely

1517
01:50:30,980 --> 01:50:35,220
uh... you know fade away like the dreamcast did uh...

1518
01:50:35,220 --> 01:50:40,460
they do say that there's things that the uh... exercise he has going for it

1519
01:50:40,460 --> 01:50:42,500
that the dreamcast did not

1520
01:50:42,500 --> 01:50:43,140
there's like a

1521
01:50:43,140 --> 01:50:45,600
a sequel to the article on the on the site so

1522
01:50:45,600 --> 01:50:48,700
this is all about a lot of stuff that

1523
01:50:48,700 --> 01:50:53,400
You know, personally, it's just the people that are gonna be buying it aren't smart enough to, like, say,

1524
01:50:53,400 --> 01:50:58,700
okay, Microsoft, you know, you're really holding back your allocations, you know, that's kind of pissing me off

1525
01:50:58,700 --> 01:51:00,400
I'm gonna go buy something else.

1526
01:51:00,400 --> 01:51:04,000
People aren't gonna do that. They're just gonna be like, well, I'm gonna wait, you know, or something,

1527
01:51:04,000 --> 01:51:07,200
like, because it's the first system, next gen, that's coming out.

1528
01:51:07,200 --> 01:51:12,400
And PlayStation 3, it's really, it's always on the fence with me.

1529
01:51:12,400 --> 01:51:16,400
I'm not sure if it's gonna be a good system or not, because they keep saying,

1530
01:51:16,400 --> 01:51:23,400
Oh, now there's a problem with it overheating. It's not coming out until 2007. Well, if this thing comes out in 2007, it's going to be too late.

1531
01:51:23,400 --> 01:51:26,400
It's going to have lost the market share.

1532
01:51:26,400 --> 01:51:30,400
Well, now, remember the golden rule of gaming, Dark Sakura?

1533
01:51:30,400 --> 01:51:34,400
The system is only as good as the games on it.

1534
01:51:34,400 --> 01:51:38,400
Xbox 360, though, it has some pretty good games on it. I'm most excited.

1535
01:51:38,400 --> 01:51:43,200
They're launching better this time because they actually have something on it that is

1536
01:51:43,200 --> 01:51:49,040
not a fighting, a driving, or sports title on it.

1537
01:51:49,040 --> 01:51:53,760
They have, you know, like Cameo, and they have some other, you know, interesting titles

1538
01:51:53,760 --> 01:51:54,760
around launch.

1539
01:51:54,760 --> 01:51:58,720
The Elder Scrolls and stuff, so it's nice to see variety in their launch titles as well.

1540
01:51:58,720 --> 01:51:59,720
No, no, no.

1541
01:51:59,720 --> 01:52:01,720
They have Cameo.

1542
01:52:01,720 --> 01:52:06,520
Well, on the actual launch day they have Cameo, but they have Elder Scrolls, you know, not

1543
01:52:06,520 --> 01:52:07,520
that far out, right?

1544
01:52:07,520 --> 01:52:08,880
right with the oval

1545
01:52:08,880 --> 01:52:10,160
and the king kong

1546
01:52:10,160 --> 01:52:13,800
is a little bit different to give it that and the first-person shooter still

1547
01:52:13,800 --> 01:52:16,140
all sort of a moment

1548
01:52:16,140 --> 01:52:18,920
but i was not much of a okay with

1549
01:52:18,920 --> 01:52:23,080
yes so that they're coming out with some more stuff

1550
01:52:23,080 --> 01:52:24,000
all right

1551
01:52:24,000 --> 01:52:27,640
we're gonna break as we come after this break the long the promised we said we

1552
01:52:27,640 --> 01:52:29,280

01:52:29,280 --> 01:52:32,560
listless we've done the same in a long time he said we were going to do it all

1554
01:52:32,560 --> 01:52:33,440

1563
01:52:59,140 --> 01:53:01,180
chat room and that was for some captain jack

1564
01:53:01,180 --> 01:53:04,060
so we're going to do some captain jack starting off this break and we'll be back with

1565
01:53:04,060 --> 01:53:08,500
tonight's list-list regarding Guitar Hero 2, hypothetically. Of course it hasn't been

1566
01:53:08,500 --> 01:53:12,780
announced yet, but come on. Come on. All they have to do is make their money back and they'll

1567
01:53:12,780 --> 01:53:15,860
be a Guitar Hero 2. There's gotta be one. Alright, we'll be back after this. We'll start

1568
01:53:15,860 --> 01:53:18,500
We're off with some Captain Jack 5th Mix style, yo.

1569
01:53:45,860 --> 01:53:50,340
No matter what, I never forget that it didn't work

1570
01:53:50,340 --> 01:53:52,580
I'm really smart guy

1571
01:53:52,580 --> 01:53:57,300
I'm saying something we all know

1572
01:53:57,300 --> 01:53:59,140

Pi ya la pi

1578
01:54:07,540 --> 01:54:10,980

Tastic tambourine, pinot noir

1582
01:54:47,420 --> 01:54:49,420
Oh, my tummy's drivin'

1583
01:59:47,420 --> 01:59:54,420
This video is sponsored by the Orange Lab.

1584
01:59:54,420 --> 02:00:01,420
This video is sponsored by the Orange Lab.

1585
02:00:01,420 --> 02:00:23,660
Welcome back boys and girls to Orange Lounge Radio and I bet you kids are dying to know

1586
02:00:23,660 --> 02:00:27,420
who won tonight's cage match because we had the votes tallied.

1587
02:00:27,420 --> 02:00:33,120
So tonight's winner is a very, very, very close vote, by the way.

1588
02:00:33,120 --> 02:00:35,360
Like all three songs, neck and neck and neck.

1589
02:00:35,360 --> 02:00:39,640
In fact, tonight's vote was so close, we have a tie.

1590
02:00:39,640 --> 02:00:42,020
A tie in tonight's cage match.

1591
02:00:42,020 --> 02:00:43,540
So here are the songs that are tied.

1592
02:00:43,540 --> 02:00:51,640
The first song that's tied tonight is Depeche Mode with Precious.

1593
02:00:51,640 --> 02:01:02,240
And the second song that is tied tonight is 9 Inch Nails with Only.

1594
02:01:02,240 --> 02:01:05,840
So apparently the chat room is feeling very emo, too, although there were quite a few

1595
02:01:05,840 --> 02:01:09,340
votes for song number two, just not enough, unfortunately.

1596
02:01:09,340 --> 02:01:13,240
So going to the Cage Match rulebook, the way we break a tie, the host who picked the song

1597
02:01:13,240 --> 02:01:15,700
that did not tie gets to break the vote.

1598
02:01:15,700 --> 02:01:17,520
So Loki, which song's gonna win?

1599
02:01:17,520 --> 02:01:18,520
Depeche Mode.

1600
02:01:18,520 --> 02:01:21,400
PESH MODE wins tonight's cage match.

1601
02:01:21,400 --> 02:01:25,760
Any particular reason why you went for that one? I don't know, I just like the PESH MODE.

1602
02:01:25,760 --> 02:01:27,220
Fair enough.

1603
02:01:27,220 --> 02:01:30,660
PESH MODE wins tonight's cage match. It was the most emo of the two.

1604
02:01:30,660 --> 02:01:32,560
You mean most emoist?

1605
02:01:32,560 --> 02:01:33,940
Yeah.

1606
02:01:33,940 --> 02:01:37,340
That's what, that's what, next week I'll be reppin'.

1607
02:01:37,340 --> 02:01:38,480
Mamma Mia?

1608
02:01:38,480 --> 02:01:43,380
No. Oh, can't wait. Actually, no, I won't be here next week, so yeah, Mamma Mia will be in the cage match.

1609
02:01:43,380 --> 02:01:48,280
Okay. Well, in two weeks, we'll look forward to it. I won't even be here.

1610
02:01:48,280 --> 02:01:53,280
You're gonna be at the, well, the Gay Frat House doesn't exist anymore, but you're gonna-

1611
02:01:53,280 --> 02:01:54,280
The Gay Frat House is gone.

1612
02:01:54,280 --> 02:01:55,280
That's too bad.

1613
02:01:55,280 --> 02:02:02,280
I will be living it up in SoCo, where my, uh, harem of, uh, adoring-

1614
02:02:02,280 --> 02:02:03,280
Wait, this is next week?

1615
02:02:03,280 --> 02:02:04,280
Man players will be waiting for me.

1616
02:02:04,280 --> 02:02:05,280
This is next week?

1617
02:02:05,280 --> 02:02:08,280
Are you gonna go see Harry Potter down there?

1618
02:02:08,280 --> 02:02:09,280
GASP!

1619
02:02:09,280 --> 02:02:10,280
GASP!

1620
02:02:10,280 --> 02:02:11,280
Harry Potter?

1621
02:02:11,280 --> 02:02:16,280
Yeah, actually, because I'm gonna be staying with a, with a rather odd Harry Potter nerd.

1622
02:02:16,280 --> 02:02:21,280
Now, the reason why you're going to be gone next week, you actually have a legitimate business purpose for being gone next week.

1623
02:02:21,280 --> 02:02:22,280
We are doing this.

1624
02:02:22,280 --> 02:02:25,280
Oh wait, next week. Oh, I'm sorry. This is the 16th.

1625
02:02:25,280 --> 02:02:28,280
I thought it was the week after! How dare you!

1626
02:02:28,280 --> 02:02:29,280
Well, I thought you made-

1627
02:02:29,280 --> 02:02:30,280
Make my heart stop!

1628
02:02:30,280 --> 02:02:31,280
Whatever.

1629
02:02:33,280 --> 02:02:36,280
Speaking of which, I have nobody to go with because, um...

1630
02:02:36,280 --> 02:02:38,280
You can come with us!

1631
02:02:38,280 --> 02:02:40,280
Tim Agust doesn't like Harry Potter.

1632
02:02:40,280 --> 02:02:42,280
You can come with us and screw him.

1633
02:02:42,280 --> 02:02:45,280
Okay. Anybody want to come kidnap me?

1634
02:02:45,280 --> 02:02:49,600
don't like literally screw him but you know

1635
02:02:49,600 --> 02:02:52,960
i don't do it anyway you sicko

1636
02:02:52,960 --> 02:02:54,080
anyway

1637
02:02:54,080 --> 02:02:57,280
uh... no but uh... but that's not going to be gone next week for a legitimate

1638
02:02:57,280 --> 02:03:02,600
business purpose right out of where you're going to meet my adoring fans

1639
02:03:02,600 --> 02:03:05,920
at the podcast awards alright

1640
02:03:05,920 --> 02:03:09,080
i'm going to be there

1641
02:03:09,080 --> 02:03:11,360
in all of my uh... dark glory

1642
02:03:11,360 --> 02:03:13,660
i didn't go because he wouldn't give me any like

1643
02:03:13,660 --> 02:03:16,540
time in the mike you'd be like

1644
02:03:16,540 --> 02:03:17,780
thank you for

1645
02:03:17,780 --> 02:03:21,580
and there is another thing you know i let you get to go up there and go it's

1646
02:03:21,580 --> 02:03:23,780
so much fun and you cut off

1647
02:03:23,780 --> 02:03:26,180
but the meanwhile i would like

1648
02:03:26,180 --> 02:03:27,660
i'd like to think

1649
02:03:27,660 --> 02:03:29,940
if you get that you know if you get actually go up there and you know you

1650
02:03:29,940 --> 02:03:31,740
should be doing a lot of work

1651
02:03:31,740 --> 02:03:35,260
so i'm actually gonna say it's so much fun in your speech i hope so no

1652
02:03:35,260 --> 02:03:36,580
called damn

1653
02:03:36,580 --> 02:03:39,620
will record it or something as we were here

1654
02:03:39,620 --> 02:03:42,340
and and i'm going to say

1655
02:03:42,340 --> 02:03:43,460
GIVE ME A DOOR!

1656
02:03:44,180 --> 02:03:45,180
If you'll sit down.

1657
02:03:47,280 --> 02:03:49,280
Don't embarrass us, DarkSockra.

1658
02:03:50,020 --> 02:03:51,020
I never do.

1659
02:03:51,200 --> 02:03:53,200
It's just a representation of the show.

1660
02:03:53,200 --> 02:03:55,200
Could you please thank my mother while you're down there?

1661
02:03:56,000 --> 02:03:58,000
I THANK YOUR MOTHER!

1662
02:03:59,500 --> 02:04:02,500
I'd like to thank your mom!

1663
02:04:03,660 --> 02:04:04,660
Alright.

1664
02:04:04,660 --> 02:04:08,340
Uh, we're gonna get into tonight's list list very shortly, but I do want to give a little bit of a reminder.

1665
02:04:08,340 --> 02:04:10,340
Ultramix3, right around the corner.

1666
02:04:10,340 --> 02:04:13,340
Ultramix 3's got a damn impressive lineup. Is that out this Tuesday, I think?

1667
02:04:13,340 --> 02:04:14,340
Next week.

1668
02:04:14,340 --> 02:04:15,340
Next week?

1669
02:04:15,340 --> 02:04:16,340
It's the week of the 14th.

1670
02:04:16,340 --> 02:04:18,340
Ah hell, I heard it was leaking early, I don't know.

1671
02:04:18,340 --> 02:04:19,340
Wait a minute.

1672
02:04:19,340 --> 02:04:23,340
I swear to God, again I'm going to go broke before my birthday, right Rob?

1673
02:04:23,340 --> 02:04:31,340
You also have that same week, Flow, the urban dance uprising, in case you feel a little bit like a breakbeat mood and you have the extra money to waste on stuff.

1674
02:04:31,340 --> 02:04:39,340
Yeah, like I said, Ultramix 3 is coming out and I know a lot of you guys are going to buy Ultramix 3 and you wouldn't want to buy any other dancing game except Ultramix 3 that day.

1675
02:04:39,340 --> 02:04:45,220
Alright, um, oh I wanted to mention something about DDR Mario too, I keep putting off the

1676
02:04:45,220 --> 02:04:50,060
list list, but um, DDR Mario, there's been tournaments going on like everywhere, there's

1677
02:04:50,060 --> 02:04:53,740
actually one here in Sacramento, I don't know if you guys heard of this, I didn't go, however

1678
02:04:53,740 --> 02:04:58,580
I heard that a whopping five people entered the tournament, so congratulations to whoever

1679
02:04:58,580 --> 02:04:59,580
won out of those five people.

1680
02:04:59,580 --> 02:05:00,580
Was it?

1681
02:05:00,580 --> 02:05:01,580
A free copy of Mario DDR.

1682
02:05:01,580 --> 02:05:02,580
Was it Andrew?

1683
02:05:02,580 --> 02:05:07,180
I don't know, no I don't think it was him that won, I think it was somebody else.

1684
02:05:07,180 --> 02:05:11,060
I don't know who won, but I know who posted about it.

1685
02:05:11,060 --> 02:05:13,740
Uh, yeah, explicit. Anyway, yeah.

1686
02:05:13,740 --> 02:05:16,920
I don't know who won. We'll have to find out from him.

1687
02:05:16,920 --> 02:05:19,540
I'm sure they did a fabulous job and

1688
02:05:19,540 --> 02:05:22,500
earned their Mario DDR, which is a game I don't think I'm going to buy.

1689
02:05:22,500 --> 02:05:23,500
Honestly, I'm just...

1690
02:05:23,500 --> 02:05:26,360
I'm not feeling the Mario DDR. I love Nintendo,

1691
02:05:26,360 --> 02:05:27,700
I love DDR,

1692
02:05:27,700 --> 02:05:32,220
but I'm not feeling the Mario DDR. It's just not... I know it would last five minutes.

1693
02:05:32,220 --> 02:05:34,580
The honeymoon would be over before it begins.

1694
02:05:34,580 --> 02:05:38,300
Hey, Walt, you know what you have to steal your money instead?

1695
02:05:38,300 --> 02:05:40,000
Mario Party 7

1696
02:05:40,000 --> 02:05:41,420
Okay, I'll go with that, because

1697
02:05:41,420 --> 02:05:45,540
I love playing Mario Party 7 because I'm an evil bitch when I play as Peach in that game.

1698
02:05:45,540 --> 02:05:47,460
I'm a vindictive motherfucker. They need

1699
02:05:47,460 --> 02:05:48,520
DS

1700
02:05:48,520 --> 02:05:50,160
Mario Party

1701
02:05:50,160 --> 02:05:55,300
so we can get some Wi-Fi going. I hope that was a rumor, something that was in development was the DS Mario Party.

1702
02:05:55,300 --> 02:06:00,600
We'll see though, because think about all the minigames, because the minigames are starting to get a little stale, but think about all the new stuff they could do with the pen.

1703
02:06:00,600 --> 02:06:02,560
Yeah. Be fun.

1704
02:06:02,560 --> 02:06:06,720
All right, let's get into tonight's Listless.

1705
02:06:06,720 --> 02:06:08,840
All right.

1706
02:06:08,840 --> 02:06:11,080
The way that Listless works, because it's been a hell of a

1707
02:06:11,080 --> 02:06:14,120
long time since we've done one of these segments, what we're

1708
02:06:14,120 --> 02:06:16,920
going to do is each of us here in studio, so it would be the

1709
02:06:16,920 --> 02:06:19,480
three hosts, myself, Dark Sakura, and Loki, and then our

1710
02:06:19,480 --> 02:06:21,360
special guest, Angel, because Buzz left.

1711
02:06:21,360 --> 02:06:23,760
He decided to go watch Family Guy or something.

1712
02:06:23,760 --> 02:06:28,600
We're each going to put in three entries, basically, or

1713
02:06:28,600 --> 02:06:32,400
three answers, statements, to tonight's topic.

1714
02:06:32,400 --> 02:06:36,800
Tonight's topic is song we most want to see in Guitar Hero 2.

1715
02:06:36,800 --> 02:06:39,900
Okay, so we're each going to name three songs, but then there's a twist!

1716
02:06:39,900 --> 02:06:41,500
What's a twist?

1717
02:06:41,500 --> 02:06:45,900
The twist tonight, as it is every night when we do Listless, is that then we go around the room

1718
02:06:45,900 --> 02:06:50,100
and each person gets to take one thing off of the list.

1719
02:06:50,100 --> 02:06:51,400
Oh, snap!

1720
02:06:51,400 --> 02:06:55,300
All right, and then you guys in chat, you get to vote on your favorite,

1721
02:06:55,300 --> 02:06:59,700
and then we come up through this highly scientific process we call Listless

1722
02:06:59,700 --> 02:07:04,460
of the top three songs we want to see in Guitar Hero 2.

1723
02:07:04,460 --> 02:07:08,980
Alright, so that being said, let's start it off. Everybody ready to go? Got their three songs?

1724
02:07:08,980 --> 02:07:12,620
Uh, there we go. Alright, Angel, you're lowest on the totem pole.

1725
02:07:12,620 --> 02:07:17,900
You start us off. Just messing with you. What's your number three pick?

1726
02:07:17,900 --> 02:07:21,980
Uh, I don't want you on a boat.

1727
02:07:21,980 --> 02:07:26,300
Uh, anything from Dragon Force. You guys are like, huh?

1728
02:07:26,300 --> 02:07:28,300
Okay, you gotta explain that one.

1729
02:07:56,300 --> 02:07:58,580
I'm gonna Google that, go ahead.

1730
02:07:58,580 --> 02:08:00,100
All right, anything by Dragon Force,

1731
02:08:00,100 --> 02:08:01,900
first thing on tonight's list.

1732
02:08:01,900 --> 02:08:03,820
We'll go over, I'll go next.

1733
02:08:03,820 --> 02:08:06,980
My number three pick for tonight's list

1734
02:08:06,980 --> 02:08:10,140
is the song Bitch by Meredith Brooks.

1735
02:08:10,140 --> 02:08:10,980
And I don't know if you remember,

1736
02:08:10,980 --> 02:08:12,940
this song from the 90s was kind of a one-hit wonder.

1737
02:08:12,940 --> 02:08:14,460
I'm a bitch.

1738
02:08:14,460 --> 02:08:16,900
I actually met this woman once, she was really nice,

1739
02:08:16,900 --> 02:08:19,180
and she actually is a really good guitar player,

1740
02:08:19,180 --> 02:08:21,380
and that's something people never really picked up about her

1741
02:08:21,380 --> 02:08:23,380
but she's inspired by Hendrix and all those people.

1742
02:08:23,380 --> 02:08:25,140
She's a really good guitar player,

1743
02:08:25,140 --> 02:08:32,140
and i just want to play bitch on guitar hero that would rock so uh... that's my pick for number three song

1744
02:08:32,140 --> 02:08:38,420
uh... my number three song is going to be kenny loggins with danger zone

1745
02:08:38,420 --> 02:08:39,660
that song

1746
02:08:39,660 --> 02:08:45,300
granted it's really cheesy and stuff but it's really a good guitar song

1747
02:08:45,300 --> 02:08:49,620
is that the same one from top gun? yep that would be the same one from top gun

1748
02:08:49,620 --> 02:08:53,320
uh... i thought that the queen of the show you to the last and number three

1749
02:08:53,320 --> 02:09:00,320
uh... eighty-three harry to hell

1750
02:09:00,400 --> 02:09:04,820
i'm going up the ones that we see now we're talking talking highway to hell

1751
02:09:04,820 --> 02:09:06,500
although

1752
02:09:06,500 --> 02:09:11,500
although i can't fucking stand that guy's voice

1753
02:09:11,500 --> 02:09:16,420
well i almost put in big balls

1754
02:09:16,420 --> 02:09:18,100
i love

1755
02:09:18,100 --> 02:09:24,920
I love the guitar. So that would be a bad ass song to play in Guitar Hero. I definitely support you. I will not take that off the list, I guarantee you.

1756
02:09:24,920 --> 02:09:28,140
Alright, let's go around to the number two picks.

1757
02:09:28,140 --> 02:09:31,120
Uh, Angel, what's your number two pick?

1758
02:09:31,120 --> 02:09:32,020
Pearl Jam.

1759
02:09:32,020 --> 02:09:33,920
Uh...

1760
02:09:33,920 --> 02:09:36,900
Either...

1761
02:09:36,900 --> 02:09:40,960
Let's see, fine, Alive.

1762
02:09:40,960 --> 02:09:44,940
That's a good band to have in Guitar Hero, Pearl Jam. We kind of missed some in the last one.

1763
02:09:44,940 --> 02:09:48,580

filter with hayman nice shot

1768
02:10:04,260 --> 02:10:07,260
is it true that that song is about some guy that killed himself or something

1769
02:10:07,260 --> 02:10:08,860

1770
02:10:08,860 --> 02:10:11,140

1773
02:10:15,940 --> 02:10:17,140
Wow, alright.

1774
02:10:17,140 --> 02:10:22,660
Uh, my number two pick, uh, my number two pick for a song that should be in Guitar Hero 2 would be

1775
02:10:22,660 --> 02:10:25,480
Uh, Are You Gonna Go My Way by Lenny Kravitz.

1776
02:10:25,480 --> 02:10:29,620
Cause that song's badass and it has a great guitar riff in it.

1777
02:10:29,620 --> 02:10:35,080
So I'm gonna, uh, do that. Are You Gonna Go My Way by Lenny Kravitz.

1778
02:10:35,080 --> 02:10:37,440
Dark Soccer, your number two pick.

1779
02:10:37,440 --> 02:10:39,500
Um, I'm going...

1780
02:10:39,500 --> 02:10:41,060
God damn this stupid thing.

1781
02:10:41,060 --> 02:10:42,640
Um...

1782
02:10:42,640 --> 02:10:48,080
I'm gonna have to go with, um, Metallica, and I've had a hard time narrowing it down,

1783
02:10:48,080 --> 02:10:51,800
because I... there's just a whole bunch of fuckin' good Metallica songs.

1784
02:10:51,800 --> 02:10:54,200
So I'd have to say, um...

1785
02:10:57,960 --> 02:10:59,480
Mmm...

1786
02:10:59,480 --> 02:11:03,240
Yeah, actually, I'm gonna have to go with, uh, Master of Puppets.

1787
02:11:03,240 --> 02:11:06,920
Okay, th-thank you, I'm glad she changed her mind at the last minute and decided not to do a new song.

1788
02:11:06,920 --> 02:11:13,920
a master of puppets by Metallica. Badass, I'm liking this list so far. We got some good

1789
02:11:15,800 --> 02:11:21,400
shit on here. We're going to rock out on Guitar Hero 2. I hope Red Octane's listening. Angel,

1790
02:11:21,400 --> 02:11:27,920
your number one pick for song you most want to see in fucking Guitar Hero 2. I'm going

1791
02:11:27,920 --> 02:11:34,920
to scare you guys with this one. Rainbow with Stargazer. Just because the guitar in that

1792
02:11:34,920 --> 02:11:35,920
and that's pretty cool.

1793
02:11:35,920 --> 02:11:38,920
I have a massive question mark over my head.

1794
02:11:38,920 --> 02:11:39,920
Really?

1795
02:11:39,920 --> 02:11:40,920
Richie Blackmore.

1796
02:11:40,920 --> 02:11:41,920
Anyway, yeah, 1976.

1797
02:11:41,920 --> 02:11:43,920
You don't want to know.

1798
02:11:43,920 --> 02:11:44,920
Okay, some classic stuff.

1799
02:11:44,920 --> 02:11:46,920
Some old classic stuff.

1800
02:11:46,920 --> 02:11:48,920
Stargazer by Rainbow.

1801
02:11:48,920 --> 02:11:49,920
Alright.

1802
02:11:49,920 --> 02:11:52,920
Loki, your number one pick for Song of the Audit.

1803
02:11:52,920 --> 02:11:54,920
Damn well, better be in Guitar Hero 2.

1804
02:11:54,920 --> 02:12:02,920
Uh, Soundgarden with Black Hole Sun.

1805
02:12:02,920 --> 02:12:03,920
Nice pick.

1806
02:12:03,920 --> 02:12:06,760
sign that by sound i didn't get it

1807
02:12:06,760 --> 02:12:08,060
and if

1808
02:12:08,060 --> 02:12:10,560
if we are still going to get to uh...

1809
02:12:10,560 --> 02:12:13,900
if we had to be out of that's what i feel that it is all tied by the who

1810
02:12:13,900 --> 02:12:17,000
doesn't love but i don't think you know that if they could do it where they

1811
02:12:17,000 --> 02:12:20,500
played a video in the background of the stage while they're

1812
02:12:20,500 --> 02:12:22,780
just don't mind that i have been

1813
02:12:22,780 --> 02:12:24,780
monitor in amplitude they did that

1814
02:12:24,780 --> 02:12:29,020
i remember you can see that the point twenty-two video and i want some

1815
02:12:29,020 --> 02:12:32,580
all right my number one picture song i would most want to see you tired here

1816
02:12:32,580 --> 02:12:33,620
too

1817
02:12:33,620 --> 02:12:36,620
would be more human than human by white zombie?

1818
02:12:36,620 --> 02:12:37,620
Shit yeah.

1819
02:12:38,620 --> 02:12:41,120
I am the red moon down, look at that blue moon.

1820
02:12:41,120 --> 02:12:44,120
I love that song, so we're gonna do more human than human by white zombie.

1821
02:12:45,120 --> 02:12:47,120
Dark soccer, your number one pick.

1822
02:12:48,120 --> 02:12:51,120
It was a really tough thing for me to think of,

1823
02:12:51,120 --> 02:12:54,120
um, however I'm gonna go with blur song two.

1824
02:12:54,120 --> 02:12:55,620
So, woohoo!

1825
02:12:55,620 --> 02:12:58,120
One, three people who only know it as the woohoo song.

1826
02:12:58,120 --> 02:13:01,620
I knew that blur gorillas would be on your list somewhere,

1827
02:13:01,620 --> 02:13:07,860
that's a good choice not at all i think there's no other way okay but i think more people

1828
02:13:07,860 --> 02:13:12,580
of course more people know you know everybody knows that one so yeah am i allowed to kill one

1829
02:13:14,260 --> 02:13:21,860
no i mean yes okay what uh change dragon force i can't believe i said that but change dragon force

1830
02:13:21,860 --> 02:13:22,860
to

1831
02:13:22,860 --> 02:13:24,660
uh...

1832
02:13:24,660 --> 02:13:26,660
Foo Fighters Everlong

1833
02:13:26,660 --> 02:13:30,420
Everlong?

1834
02:13:30,420 --> 02:13:33,500
Alright, so here's the list as it stands so far.

1835
02:13:33,500 --> 02:13:35,340
Everlong by Foo Fighters

1836
02:13:35,340 --> 02:13:37,060
Bitch by Meredith Brooks

1837
02:13:37,060 --> 02:13:39,140
Danger Zone by Kenny Loggins

1838
02:13:39,140 --> 02:13:41,420
Highway to Hell by ACDC

1839
02:13:41,420 --> 02:13:43,220
Alive by Pearl Jam

1840
02:13:43,220 --> 02:13:45,460
Hey Man Nice Shot by Filter

1841
02:13:45,460 --> 02:13:47,660
Are You Gonna Go My Way by Lenny Kravitz

1842
02:13:47,660 --> 02:13:49,780
Master of Puppets by Metallica

1843
02:13:49,780 --> 02:13:51,700
Stargazer by Rainbow

1844
02:13:51,700 --> 02:13:57,700
Black Hole Sun by Soundgarden, More Human Than Human by White Zombie, Song 2 by Blur.

1845
02:13:57,700 --> 02:14:00,700
You know what, fuck, let's just send this to Red Octane and say this is what we want.

1846
02:14:00,700 --> 02:14:03,700
I mean, this is a great list right here. This is an awesome list.

1847
02:14:03,700 --> 02:14:05,700
As you know, I do think that our top three, we actually should say,

1848
02:14:05,700 --> 02:14:10,700
hey, all of the listeners of Warriors Lounge Radio voted and want these songs in the next game.

1849
02:14:10,700 --> 02:14:13,700
You know what's interesting about this list, though? No Nirvana.

1850
02:14:13,700 --> 02:14:17,700
We have Foo Fighters, I was thinking it.

1851
02:14:17,700 --> 02:14:21,700
I was mentioned that I almost put it in with the White Snake, Here I Go Again.

1852
02:14:21,700 --> 02:14:27,700
Oh, so many good songs. This can only be the beginning of many great songs. There's many, many great songs.

1853
02:14:27,700 --> 02:14:31,700
Obviously we missed some big ones, but these are the ones that are near and dear to our heart.

1854
02:14:31,700 --> 02:14:37,700
If this is going to be tough, I know I say this every week that it's going to be tough to eliminate songs on the list, but tonight especially, this one is going to suck.

1855
02:14:37,700 --> 02:14:43,700
Because this is a really good list, but we have to do it. It's part of the game. Let's start taking them off. Angel.

1856
02:14:43,700 --> 02:14:48,700
Oh, no. I can't do this! No!

1857
02:14:48,700 --> 02:14:53,700
Uh... Oh, geez.

1858
02:14:53,700 --> 02:14:55,700
Danger Zone.

1859
02:14:55,700 --> 02:15:00,700
Alright, say goodbye to Top Gun. Danger Zone by Kenny Loggins coming off the list.

1860
02:15:00,700 --> 02:15:03,700
Loki, what are you taking off the list?

1861
02:15:03,700 --> 02:15:08,700
Um...

1862
02:15:08,700 --> 02:15:12,700
I'm just gonna have to take off Bitch, it's just not as rocking as the rest of them.

1863
02:15:13,700 --> 02:15:17,700
I wasn't too attached to that song being there, I just kinda had to throw that in there, cause you know, I'm a bitch.

1864
02:15:17,700 --> 02:15:18,700
I would have.

1865
02:15:18,700 --> 02:15:22,700
Yeah, so, um, my turn to take something off, I...

1866
02:15:22,700 --> 02:15:28,700
This is tough, and I apologize, but I kinda got the question mark with this song too, and maybe it's just because I'm uncultured.

1867
02:15:28,700 --> 02:15:32,700
I have to take Stargazer by Rainbow off the list, I just, I'm sorry.

1868
02:15:32,700 --> 02:15:34,700
People, pick up two of my picks!

1869
02:15:34,700 --> 02:15:40,700
No, that's fine, um, I can send you the song later and you're probably gonna, like, kill

1870
02:15:40,700 --> 02:15:44,700
yourself later, cause you'll be like, oh, why did I take that off?

1871
02:15:44,700 --> 02:15:49,700
No, you know, you got ACDC and you got, oh, oh, you mean, oh, I thought you meant-

1872
02:15:49,700 --> 02:15:51,700
You made me hit the hard choices!

1873
02:15:51,700 --> 02:15:53,700
Yeah, we'll leave you with a very hard choice, Darksider.

1874
02:15:53,700 --> 02:15:58,700
Here's the list, Everlong, Highway to Hell, Alive, Hey Man Nice Shot, Are You Gonna Go

1875
02:15:58,700 --> 02:16:03,700
My Way, Master of Puppets, Black Hole Sun, More Human Than Human, Song 2, you got a very

1876
02:16:03,700 --> 02:16:07,980
you get a very difficult choice. You're not gonna make any friends either way, so you

1877
02:16:07,980 --> 02:16:16,980
might as well just get it over with. Thank you. Just rip the band-aid off. DMD, Si.

1878
02:16:16,980 --> 02:16:21,700
Everlong. Everlong by Foo Fighters. Tough choice, though. Of all of them, that one's

1879
02:16:21,700 --> 02:16:25,900
my least favorite. That was a tough choice. Alright, so here it is. This is the one you

02:16:25,900 --> 02:16:30,780
guys get to vote on, so send us your pick. Your number one pick and we will determine

1881
02:16:30,780 --> 02:16:37,500

1883
02:16:44,500 --> 02:16:50,820

1886
02:17:06,640 --> 02:17:12,720
to blame for that, you know. I know. Bleached asshole. Alright, so we will reveal the definitive

1887
02:17:12,720 --> 02:17:19,120
list a little later in the program. And I will personally throw up on the doorstep of

1888
02:17:19,120 --> 02:17:25,680
Red Octane if they ever put corn or Slipknot in it. Okay, corn I could deal with. Corn's

1889
02:17:25,680 --> 02:17:30,880
pretty cool until like until they hit MTV corn was very cool like adidas you

1890
02:17:30,880 --> 02:17:34,520
know all day I dream about that that was a cool song but you know when they kind

1891
02:17:34,520 --> 02:17:39,520
of you know started being on MTV all the time I didn't dig him so much but no

1892
02:17:39,520 --> 02:17:45,840
slipknot no please no please God no however guar would be awesome

1893
02:17:45,840 --> 02:17:50,140
See, all of Winona's big down beaver.

1894
02:17:50,140 --> 02:17:51,540
Winona's big down beaver.

1895
02:17:51,540 --> 02:17:52,540
Winona's...

1896
02:17:52,540 --> 02:17:54,160
Oh my God I forgot about that song.

1897
02:17:54,160 --> 02:17:56,080
That song was badass.

1898
02:17:56,080 --> 02:17:59,820
My ex boyfriend in Alabama was like the worlds biggest Primus fan.

1899
02:17:59,820 --> 02:18:07,520
So we would go down his civic MRX playing Primus at like downtown Mobile and then all

1900
02:18:07,520 --> 02:18:09,560
the old people would wake up.

1901
02:18:09,560 --> 02:18:12,440
Or just the theme song to South Park.

1902
02:18:12,440 --> 02:18:19,120
So those votes are coming in there into the chat right now.

1903
02:18:19,120 --> 02:18:20,120
Let's talk a little bit real quick.

1904
02:18:20,120 --> 02:18:23,360
We are going to take a quick break so we can allow all the votes to come in.

1905
02:18:23,360 --> 02:18:27,680
However, I want to definitely plug some of the spin-off programming here on Orange Launch

1906
02:18:27,680 --> 02:18:28,680
Radio.

1907
02:18:28,680 --> 02:18:32,400
And we'll start it off with Monday nights on the station.

1908
02:18:32,400 --> 02:18:35,800
Extrofer, who's not here tonight, he's spending some quality family time, his sister's over

1909
02:18:35,800 --> 02:18:37,200
and I think they're watching a movie.

1910
02:18:37,200 --> 02:18:40,920
So Extrofer has his show on Monday nights, it's Extrofer's Case of the Mondays.

1911
02:18:40,920 --> 02:18:46,920
And it'll definitely clear up any Monday blahs that you were having with his very frank and

1912
02:18:46,920 --> 02:18:48,000
honest talk.

1913
02:18:48,000 --> 02:18:53,600
And last week on the show, he had John on the show last week, and John doesn't even

1914
02:18:53,600 --> 02:18:58,280
play games, really, although I did catch him playing Final Fantasy VI once, but it's the

1915
02:18:58,280 --> 02:19:01,700
show where they kind of talk about games, but they talk about cool stuff, too.

1916
02:19:01,700 --> 02:19:05,360
So if you just want to have a good time, Monday nights on the station is extra first case

1917
02:19:05,360 --> 02:19:06,360
of the Mondays.

1918
02:19:06,360 --> 02:19:08,320
Now, Tuesday nights is also a very good time.

1919
02:19:08,320 --> 02:19:09,320
Why is that dark soccer?

1920
02:19:09,320 --> 02:19:16,680
Because I rule the radio. It's pump up the volume and this week actually by popular

1921
02:19:16,680 --> 02:19:23,320

1923
02:19:26,680 --> 02:19:30,720
Princess and Lanky Style stopped by. We had a pretty good time. However they're

1924
02:19:30,720 --> 02:19:33,080
not going to be here next week but we're still going to have a really good show.

1925
02:19:33,080 --> 02:19:36,980
I'm very excited about the show this week. I think this is the week I'm going

1926
02:19:36,980 --> 02:19:41,580
do my 80s marathon because fucking a I love the 80s and actually you know what

1927
02:19:41,580 --> 02:19:48,420
song I've had stuck in my head all week long a word up I've had cameo in my head

1928
02:19:48,420 --> 02:19:51,300
all week so I have to get that out of my head so we're gonna do that this

1929
02:19:51,300 --> 02:19:55,380
Wednesday on the Rob Roberts show and also I like to somebody said I just sit

1930
02:19:55,380 --> 02:19:58,580
there and read slash dot stories but it's so not that it's so much more than

1931
02:19:58,580 --> 02:20:04,380
just telling you guys what's popular out there on the interweb so I I read FARC

1932
02:20:04,380 --> 02:20:09,780

1933
02:20:09,780 --> 02:20:14,380
time I like my show it's fun so tune in Monday Tuesday Wednesday nights on

1934
02:20:14,380 --> 02:20:20,620

1936
02:20:30,140 --> 02:20:34,820
So, while we're, uh, finishing getting your votes, um, we would start the FUs of the Week

1937
02:20:34,820 --> 02:20:38,340
normally, but I can't, I don't want both those things to overlap each other with the private

1938
02:20:38,340 --> 02:20:39,340
messages.

1939
02:20:39,340 --> 02:20:40,340
I can only handle so much.

1940
02:20:40,340 --> 02:20:43,180
So we're gonna do a quick break, and then we're gonna come back, reveal the winners

1941
02:20:43,180 --> 02:20:47,020
of tonight's list list, and, so get those votes in now, and we're gonna move into the

1942
02:20:47,020 --> 02:20:51,100
FUs of the Week, because I know y'all are angsty, and Dark Sakura has a new theme song

1943
02:20:51,100 --> 02:20:56,300
for her FUs tonight, and I'll tell you what, it's probably the best damn FU theme song

1944
02:20:56,300 --> 02:20:57,300
yet, I think.

1945
02:20:57,300 --> 02:20:58,300
It is.

1946
02:20:58,300 --> 02:20:59,300
I forgot what I picked.

1947
02:20:59,300 --> 02:21:03,940
Well, you'll find out when we get back or if you're nice, I'll tell you during the break

1948
02:21:06,380 --> 02:21:09,220
So we'll be back after this in this break

1949
02:21:09,220 --> 02:21:14,420
I think what we're gonna do is you know, I had some people requesting this even though we played it on last week's show

1950
02:21:14,860 --> 02:21:19,180
This song is just so cool. I don't know how you cannot like this song

1951
02:21:19,300 --> 02:21:24,820
so we have to I give it its due and I apologize though because oh

1952
02:21:24,820 --> 02:21:33,380
Oh shit, if I can find it, uh oh, we'll try to get to it during the break at some point.

1953
02:21:33,380 --> 02:21:35,260
I can't find it all of a sudden.

1954
02:21:35,260 --> 02:21:39,220
We'll be back, how embarrassing is that, oh well.

1955
02:21:39,220 --> 02:21:43,700
We'll try and get to that song, but in the meantime you get some other songs.

1956
02:21:43,700 --> 02:21:49,140
We'll start it off with something from UltraMix 2, because we haven't played a lot of newer

1957
02:21:49,140 --> 02:21:50,620
stuff tonight.

1958
02:21:50,620 --> 02:21:54,180
So we'll do an UltraMix 2 song, and we'll be back after this.

1959
02:21:54,180 --> 02:21:56,180
So we're going to start it off with Toe Jam.

1960
02:21:56,180 --> 02:22:03,180
You're listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

1961
02:23:56,180 --> 02:24:03,180
This is not dead air, it's just that this song has a very quiet opening, so you'll just

1962
02:24:03,180 --> 02:24:10,180
just that this song has a very quiet opening so you'll just have to deal with it a little bit.

1963
02:24:33,180 --> 02:24:36,080
Istanbul, now Constantinople, been a long time gone

1964
02:24:36,080 --> 02:24:39,180
Constantinople, now it's Thursday night, on a moon late night

1965
02:24:39,180 --> 02:24:42,180
Every gal in Constantinople lives in Istanbul

1966
02:24:42,180 --> 02:24:44,180
Now Constantinople, so view the day

1967
02:24:44,180 --> 02:24:47,180
In Constantinople, she'll be waiting in Istanbul

1968
02:24:47,180 --> 02:24:51,680
Even old New York, was once New Amsterdam

1969
02:24:51,680 --> 02:24:53,680
Why they changed and I can't say

1970
02:24:53,680 --> 02:24:55,680
People just liked it better that way

1971
02:24:55,680 --> 02:24:57,680
So take me back to Constantinople

1972
02:24:57,680 --> 02:25:01,180
No you can't go back to Constantinople, been a long time gone

1973
02:25:01,180 --> 02:25:04,180
Constantinople, why did Constantinople get the works?

1974
02:25:04,180 --> 02:25:07,180
That's so what it is about the Turks

1975
02:25:14,180 --> 02:25:16,180
Istanbul

1976
02:25:23,180 --> 02:25:26,180
Istanbul, even old New York

1977
02:25:26,180 --> 02:25:28,180
Was once New Amsterdam

1978
02:25:28,180 --> 02:25:30,180
Why they changed it, I can't say

1979
02:25:30,180 --> 02:25:32,180
You just liked it better that way!

1980
02:25:32,180 --> 02:25:34,180
Constantinople was Constantinople

1981
02:25:34,180 --> 02:25:36,180
Now it's Istanbul, now Constantinople

1982
02:25:36,180 --> 02:25:38,180
They're a long time gone

1983
02:25:38,180 --> 02:25:40,180
And Constantinople, why did Constantinople get the works?

1984
02:25:40,180 --> 02:25:44,180
That's nobody's, it's by the Turks

1985
02:25:44,180 --> 02:26:13,540
So take me back to Constantinople No you can't go back to Constantinople

1986
02:26:13,540 --> 02:26:16,660
It's been a long time gone, Constantinople had a Constantinople

1987
02:26:16,660 --> 02:26:22,780
Get the works, that's nobody's business but the Turks

1988
02:26:22,780 --> 02:26:27,980
HISTANBO!

1989
02:27:52,780 --> 02:28:20,780
Let's listen in on an Orange Lounge Radio staff meeting.

1990
02:28:20,780 --> 02:28:22,780
Do we want to be accepted by Hollywood?

1991
02:28:22,780 --> 02:28:24,780
No!

1992
02:28:24,780 --> 02:28:26,780
Do we care what people think of us?

1993
02:28:26,780 --> 02:28:28,780
No!

1994
02:28:28,780 --> 02:28:30,780
Do we want people to kiss our ass?

1995
02:28:30,780 --> 02:28:32,780
Yes!

1996
02:28:34,780 --> 02:28:40,780
Extreme Bamani Radio, that's us, Orange Lounge Radio.

1997
02:28:42,780 --> 02:28:45,780
Alright, we're back in the list list.

1998
02:28:45,780 --> 02:28:51,860
We're about to reveal the definitive list as voted by you the chat room of the three songs

1999
02:28:52,100 --> 02:28:58,700
You most want to see in guitar hero 2 you guys ready for this. What do you think? What do you think one?

2000
02:29:00,300 --> 02:29:02,300
Early guesses

2001
02:29:06,580 --> 02:29:09,400
Apathetic people no bleached asshole fun

2002
02:29:09,400 --> 02:29:22,160
The number three pick you guys want to see in Guitar Hero 2, Highway to Hell by ACDC.

2003
02:29:22,160 --> 02:29:31,560
The number two song you most want to see in Listless, song two by Blur.

2004
02:29:31,560 --> 02:29:36,280
And the number one song you bitches want to see in Guitar Hero 2, buy a landslide might

2005
02:29:36,280 --> 02:29:41,220
I had by a freaking landslide vote master of puppets by Metallica

2006
02:29:44,100 --> 02:29:50,760
Knew that would happen. Yeah, by the way all three on the list. Yeah, those were all three of Jamie's pics

2007
02:30:00,980 --> 02:30:03,420
You know, it's funny is that though it was in a different order

2008
02:30:03,420 --> 02:30:05,420
So don't get too cocky over there.

2009
02:30:05,420 --> 02:30:07,420
Oh, just only two songs for me to turn around.

2010
02:30:09,420 --> 02:30:12,420
This is because not everybody appreciates we're the way I do.

2011
02:30:15,420 --> 02:30:18,420
Some other votes, though, too. You know, Are You Gonna Go My Way was a very...

2012
02:30:18,420 --> 02:30:20,420
It was like a fourth, so, you know, it wasn't all...

2013
02:30:20,420 --> 02:30:22,420
It wasn't all, Jamie.

2014
02:30:23,420 --> 02:30:25,420
All right, anyway, we're about ready to get in.

2015
02:30:25,420 --> 02:30:28,420
Yeah, now I'm in the mood where I want to get into the FUs of the week.

2016
02:30:28,420 --> 02:30:31,420
I don't know if you guys are feeling angsty, but I certainly am.

2017
02:30:31,420 --> 02:30:36,420
Now, DarkSakura, you changed your theme song yet again.

2018
02:30:36,420 --> 02:30:44,420
Yeah, that's just because I wasn't too pleased with the last one I picked.

2019
02:30:44,420 --> 02:30:46,420
Okay, well, you have a brand new FU of the Week song.

2020
02:30:46,420 --> 02:30:49,420
I think I'm going to stick with this one because it's powerful.

2021
02:30:49,420 --> 02:30:53,420
This is a badass FU song, and I can't believe it's taken us 163 episodes to get to this.

2022
02:30:53,420 --> 02:30:54,420
This is an FU song.

2023
02:30:54,420 --> 02:30:55,420
Ooh!

2024
02:30:55,420 --> 02:30:56,420
Rock!

2025
02:30:56,420 --> 02:30:57,420
Speaking of rock.

2026
02:30:57,420 --> 02:30:58,420
I've been scared of the horns a lot.

2027
02:30:58,420 --> 02:31:04,420
Alright, so, um, here we go, Dark Sakura, why is it that we do the FUs of the week every single week?

2028
02:31:04,420 --> 02:31:07,420
Cuz we're freakin' pissed off!

2029
02:31:13,420 --> 02:31:15,420
MURDER!

2030
02:31:17,420 --> 02:31:21,420
Oh, yeah, this makes me feel mighty.

2031
02:31:21,420 --> 02:31:25,420
Um, my first FU goes toward...

2032
02:31:25,420 --> 02:31:28,420
Migraines! Yes, migraines!

2033
02:31:28,420 --> 02:31:34,420
Because it means that my brain is broken and they want me to go in for a CT scan.

2034
02:31:34,420 --> 02:31:40,420
The nephew goes to the stuff they gave me to help with the horrible migraines.

2035
02:31:40,420 --> 02:31:45,420
Because, well, it makes me lightheaded and feel like I'm drunk without being drunk.

2036
02:31:45,420 --> 02:31:50,420
If I'm going to feel drunk, I want the benefit of booze to feel drunk.

2037
02:31:50,420 --> 02:32:00,420
kostjamrh and people who decide to pull into my lane, they think, toward me.

2038
02:32:00,420 --> 02:32:15,420
An F.U. goes toward the McDonalds, over here by Rob's house, for being rather dumb.

2039
02:32:15,420 --> 02:32:18,420
You know what's funny is all three of us went there tonight. I think that's hilarious.

2040
02:32:18,420 --> 02:32:21,420
And ask you to get a family in front of me because I really would get them.

2041
02:32:25,420 --> 02:32:28,420
A nephew toward me not having much time to do stuff.

2042
02:32:28,420 --> 02:32:32,420
Also a nephew to me not having the whole week to procrastinate on my homework.

2043
02:32:32,420 --> 02:32:37,420
So I have to do homework tonight, homework Monday, homework Wednesday,

2044
02:32:37,420 --> 02:32:39,420
and get it all done before I leave Thursday.

2045
02:32:41,420 --> 02:32:43,420
But that means I get to enjoy myself all weekend.

2046
02:32:43,420 --> 02:32:52,420
An F.U. in advance to the grapevine before you get to L.A. because that load is, like, crap, and there'll probably be a forest fire or something stupid.

2047
02:32:52,420 --> 02:32:56,420
As there always is every time I go to L.A.

2048
02:32:56,420 --> 02:33:02,420
And then an F.U. to, uh, L.A. freeway system in general, because it sucks.

2049
02:33:02,420 --> 02:33:08,420
And the, uh, floating, uh, pockets of yellow smog that seem to be sentient.

2050
02:33:08,420 --> 02:33:14,100
Um, and an F.U. goes to my nose for draining into my throat and I'm probably going to have

2051
02:33:14,100 --> 02:33:19,100
a arthritis tomorrow. Just thought I'd let everyone know. All right, I'm done.

2052
02:33:19,100 --> 02:33:28,100
All right, Loki. Anyways, um, first fuck you to McDonald's for not being able to fill an

2053
02:33:28,100 --> 02:33:33,180
order correctly. I asked them for a two cheeseburger meal. Granted, I know that's not on their

2054
02:33:33,180 --> 02:33:38,220
menu still, but it's still something that they offer because I get it almost every day.

2055
02:33:38,220 --> 02:33:40,720
police every day this week uh...

2056
02:33:40,720 --> 02:33:42,680
at the mcdonald's it's by my house

2057
02:33:42,680 --> 02:33:45,500
at patty mc patty and instead

2058
02:33:45,500 --> 02:33:49,300
they gave me this to make chicken

2059
02:33:49,300 --> 02:33:52,940
meal thing or to make chicken sandwiches and like

2060
02:33:52,940 --> 02:33:55,220
a medium frying stuff i'm like

2061
02:33:55,220 --> 02:33:58,200
uh... knows about order all we thought

2062
02:33:58,200 --> 02:34:01,780
we don't have a teacher remind me what it is to put in the ticketing

2063
02:34:01,780 --> 02:34:06,100
scenic chicken on the phone and you should take them here

2064

2070
02:34:29,340 --> 02:34:34,980
dumb bitch you know what that takes talent to do your makeup and talk on the cell phone AND drive

2071
02:34:34,980 --> 02:34:36,620

02:34:36,620 --> 02:34:40,420

02:34:59,820 --> 02:35:02,100
anyway i don't think that it grows

2080
02:35:02,100 --> 02:35:05,340
it wasn't gross

2081
02:35:05,340 --> 02:35:07,300
it didn't show anything

2082
02:35:07,300 --> 02:35:09,540
whatever

2083
02:35:09,540 --> 02:35:11,540
and uh...

2084
02:35:11,540 --> 02:35:15,460
so fuck that and then uh...

2085
02:35:15,460 --> 02:35:17,060
you know fucking microsoft

2086
02:35:17,060 --> 02:35:18,860
for potentially

2087
02:35:18,860 --> 02:35:21,580
not allowing me to have a three sixty m on today

2088
02:35:21,580 --> 02:35:25,100
you know i pre-ordered mine way in advance and i have purchased games as

2089
02:35:25,100 --> 02:35:26,140
well

2090
02:35:26,140 --> 02:35:29,980
uh... that will be coming soon so you know what i will damn well i'd better

2091
02:35:29,980 --> 02:35:45,180
get my system or head to roll. So that's it. Heads will roll. All right, my FU time. Whoops,

2092
02:35:45,180 --> 02:35:52,900
sorry I'm supposed to make it loud. Not that song, my song. There we go. I don't want no

2093
02:35:52,900 --> 02:35:58,640
short dig man. All right, my FU's the week. FU did the fact that I feel like I'm getting

2094
02:35:58,640 --> 02:36:02,360
Being sick progressively throughout tonight's show I felt my nose get more and more stuffy

2095
02:36:02,360 --> 02:36:05,680
and a sore throat which is not good when you're supposed to be talking for eight hours a day

2096
02:36:05,680 --> 02:36:06,680
in front of people.

2097
02:36:06,680 --> 02:36:07,680
Uh oh.

2098
02:36:07,680 --> 02:36:09,160
I'm going to be fucked come next week.

2099
02:36:09,160 --> 02:36:13,200
It's a good thing I'm not in class tomorrow otherwise I would cry when I get tomorrow

2100
02:36:13,200 --> 02:36:14,200
off.

2101
02:36:14,200 --> 02:36:20,000
I'm making a stop by somewhere and getting coldies because coldies, the zinc brigade

2102
02:36:20,000 --> 02:36:21,000
begins now.

2103
02:36:21,000 --> 02:36:27,680
Do not do more than a hundred milligrams in a day or you can get zinc poisoning.

2104
02:36:27,680 --> 02:36:33,480
I know, I just, I'll keep it, well that's gotta be like 10 of those drops though to get 100 grams, or 100 milligrams.

2105
02:36:33,480 --> 02:36:41,480
Anyway, um, an F you to World of Warcraft for being all laggy, so I have to go buy more RAM, so either I'm getting an Xbox 360 or I'm getting more RAM.

2106
02:36:41,480 --> 02:36:44,180
The World of Warcraft is very pretty, I have to give it that.

2107
02:36:44,180 --> 02:36:45,480
I can be, or wasn't that pretty?

2108
02:36:45,480 --> 02:36:46,880
More RAM.

2109
02:36:46,880 --> 02:36:48,780
Get more RAM.

2110
02:36:48,780 --> 02:36:50,480
For World, yeah, for my World of Warcraft.

2111
02:36:50,480 --> 02:36:54,380
Instead of my, you're actually supporting my World of Warcraft addiction?

2112
02:36:54,380 --> 02:36:58,780
I guess, but RAM's good for everything, so, you know, it might benefit the show, too,

2113
02:36:58,780 --> 02:37:02,460
because I'm having problems on the Rob Roberts show with the program I'm using,

2114
02:37:02,460 --> 02:37:04,060
and I think it's because of a lack of RAM.

2115
02:37:04,060 --> 02:37:05,260
Yeah, RAM's good.

2116
02:37:05,260 --> 02:37:06,300
RAM is very good.

2117
02:37:06,300 --> 02:37:07,180
Oh, I like RAM.

2118
02:37:07,180 --> 02:37:08,460
Yeah, RAM's good.

2119
02:37:10,780 --> 02:37:13,660
Uh, yeah, I guess that's enough for me.

2120
02:37:13,660 --> 02:37:14,700
Actually, the flu shots.

2121
02:37:15,500 --> 02:37:18,540
Because I missed them at my work, but not that I would get one anyway.

2122
02:37:18,540 --> 02:37:20,940
They swear up and down that flu shots do not make you sick.

2123
02:37:20,940 --> 02:37:22,860
I get sick every time I have a flu shot.

2124
02:37:22,860 --> 02:37:23,980
I know, it's total bullshit.

2125
02:37:23,980 --> 02:37:25,980
I always get sick whenever I get a flu shot.

2126
02:37:25,980 --> 02:37:27,980
I don't care what the doctor says.

2127
02:37:27,980 --> 02:37:32,980
That's time out for me. You know, I get some time off work with a legitimate excuse.

2128
02:37:32,980 --> 02:37:33,980
I just...

2129
02:37:33,980 --> 02:37:36,980
If I'm not at work, it's an epidemic.

2130
02:37:36,980 --> 02:37:40,980
I mean, I don't mean to talk myself up, but damn. I have to be there.

2131
02:37:40,980 --> 02:37:44,980
Anyway, let's move on to Angel's F-You of the Week, and...

2132
02:37:47,980 --> 02:37:50,980
Uh, have you ever the guy that griefed me yesterday in there?

2133
02:37:50,980 --> 02:37:57,660
because you're an asshole a I don't think I'm a lesbian thank you very much

2134
02:37:57,660 --> 02:38:02,100
and I don't think anyone in this room thinks I am obviously because well I'm

2135
02:38:02,100 --> 02:38:09,580
taken by the best man ever in my opinion that's just me because he loves me and

2136
02:38:09,580 --> 02:38:12,820
it's all good yeah well now hypothetically you could be

2137
02:38:12,820 --> 02:38:17,780
I'm just kidding. I don't I don't care. I can't fire you damn it

2138
02:38:19,420 --> 02:38:26,820
Yeah, so um screw you because um no, I'm not and neither are my friends and

2139
02:38:27,500 --> 02:38:32,940
Neither are the two other people that were there with me that are also serving on this board

2140
02:38:32,940 --> 02:38:37,100
so you need to go find somebody something else to do rather and

2141
02:38:37,100 --> 02:38:42,420
and, or get kicked out of the game, because I can get you to do that now, so bye!

2142
02:38:42,420 --> 02:38:46,660
And, um, FU'd at having my computer break again, because that sucks.

2143
02:38:46,660 --> 02:38:50,660
Eh, I have to go fix that tonight.

2144
02:38:50,660 --> 02:38:54,460
Other than that, I think I'm done.

2145
02:38:54,460 --> 02:38:57,860
Alright, let's go to the chat room, FUs, and see what

2146
02:38:57,860 --> 02:39:03,940
angst we have going on in chat tonight. Nintendo Maniac 64 says FU to Sky for not

2147
02:39:03,940 --> 02:39:07,020
mentioning the pop versus soda argument like you said you would.

2148
02:39:07,020 --> 02:39:09,420
It's Soda, there is no argument.

2149
02:39:09,420 --> 02:39:13,320
F you chat members for not commenting on my links I posted in chat.

2150
02:39:13,320 --> 02:39:18,620
F you guys for not mentioning the revolution in the Dreamcast Xbox 360 PS3 discussion.

2151
02:39:18,620 --> 02:39:20,520
Didn't Loki say it would be out?

2152
02:39:20,520 --> 02:39:25,120
You know, we would talk about the revolution if Nintendo would throw us a frickin' bone and give us more to talk about.

2153
02:39:25,120 --> 02:39:28,920
December 9th is when they're debuting some more info.

2154
02:39:28,920 --> 02:39:33,520
They said they're never gonna show the games until they're actually playable.

2155
02:39:33,520 --> 02:39:36,520
Well then on December 9th is when we'll talk more about the revolution.

2156
02:39:36,520 --> 02:39:43,520
NintendoManiac64 says F you to myself for doing certain legal activities that involve games, emulators, and downloading.

2157
02:39:43,520 --> 02:39:46,520
Oh, did I just type that out to Sky, hee hee?

2158
02:39:46,520 --> 02:39:49,520
Actually, emulators are not legal anymore.

2159
02:39:49,520 --> 02:39:57,520
There's a loophole that's basically stated that the emulators themselves are not legal.

2160
02:39:57,520 --> 02:39:58,520
But the problems are.

2161
02:39:58,520 --> 02:40:00,520
Possibly, yes.

2162
02:40:00,520 --> 02:40:05,360
Raz says, F you to my health teacher for telling the cast and crew of the play that we aren't

2163
02:40:05,360 --> 02:40:10,520
allowed to turn on the stage lights anymore for practice because they use too much electricity.

2164
02:40:10,520 --> 02:40:13,880
Excuse me, that's stupid.

2165
02:40:13,880 --> 02:40:18,200
Goggle says, F you to me for not calling in when I actually had something to say.

2166
02:40:18,200 --> 02:40:21,480
And F you to the AI in Soulcalibur 3 for being hard.

2167
02:40:21,480 --> 02:40:22,480
Seconded.

2168
02:40:22,480 --> 02:40:23,480
Seconded.

2169
02:40:23,480 --> 02:40:26,520
Dark Setsuya says, I continued F you to Squeenix.

2170
02:40:26,520 --> 02:40:31,400
I was supposed to get my slime keychains and I haven't seen any sign of them.

2171
02:40:31,400 --> 02:40:35,340
SSJ100Matt says, F you to my boss pulling in office space and making me come in Saturday

2172
02:40:35,340 --> 02:40:37,620
and Sunday for senseless crap.

2173
02:40:37,620 --> 02:40:43,760
F you to my 4 year old Nvidia video card dying, thus making me spend a whole $75 on a replacement.

2174
02:40:43,760 --> 02:40:47,020
But just remember, Friday is Hawaiian Shirt Day.

2175
02:40:47,020 --> 02:40:49,140
GS191...

2176
02:40:49,140 --> 02:40:50,800
That's a joke.

2177
02:40:50,800 --> 02:40:53,600
Get it? No. Have you seen Office Space?

2178
02:40:53,600 --> 02:40:59,600
Actually, I also saw that movie with, uh, Yahoo Serious.

2179
02:40:59,600 --> 02:41:01,600
No, no, not him. Carrot Top!

2180
02:41:01,600 --> 02:41:02,600
Yeah.

2181
02:41:02,600 --> 02:41:03,600
There's a movie with Carrot Top.

2182
02:41:03,600 --> 02:41:04,600
I don't know.

2183
02:41:04,600 --> 02:41:07,600
I don't watch any movies with Carrot Top in them.

2184
02:41:07,600 --> 02:41:11,600
I caught it because I was, um, I had to watch it because it was an E3.

2185
02:41:11,600 --> 02:41:13,600
Can I do a tangent real quick?

2186
02:41:13,600 --> 02:41:14,600
Okay.

2187
02:41:14,600 --> 02:41:18,600
Um, my coworker called and left a voicemail for my other coworker and it was very hilarious.

2188
02:41:18,600 --> 02:41:19,600
I got to hear this too.

2189
02:41:19,600 --> 02:41:24,120
too. He used the soundboard from Ebon's World to leave this Office Space message saying,

2190
02:41:24,120 --> 02:41:29,120
yeah, we're going to need you to come in on Saturday. Did you get the memo? Really funny.

2191
02:41:29,120 --> 02:41:31,880
Really funny. And so I'm going to call and leave him and Miss Cleo.

2192
02:41:31,880 --> 02:41:39,880
Lual Wednesday, that was it. Yeah? Lual Wednesday. Lual Wednesday. More. GS191 says, F you to

2193
02:41:39,920 --> 02:41:44,380
the Xbox 360 kiosk for crashing and giving me the black screen of death and F you to

2194
02:41:44,380 --> 02:41:49,000
my online math class. Well, it's nice to know some things in Microsoft never change. Dark

2195
02:41:49,000 --> 02:41:52,600
Zacknight says F you to a customer today at my job that went nuts today just because we

2196
02:41:52,600 --> 02:41:58,000
wouldn't exchange her year old leaf blower for a new one because it broke down.

2197
02:41:58,000 --> 02:42:02,960
Jazz says F you to the Xbox 360, I saw a demo of you at Best Buy and you lagged more than

2198
02:42:02,960 --> 02:42:05,760
my computer that was on the verge of its HD exploding.

2199
02:42:05,760 --> 02:42:09,520
Why must you keep making yourself look worse and worse?

2200
02:42:09,520 --> 02:42:13,160
Legend of Zaku says F you to the asshole customers that I have to put up with in my tech help

2201
02:42:13,160 --> 02:42:17,360
desk job here on campus, thinking that they know how we do shit so they bitch and moan

2202
02:42:17,360 --> 02:42:20,360
when we tell them that we don't go to people's dorms to fix their PCs.

2203
02:42:20,360 --> 02:42:24,360
In other words, they are too lazy to bring down their PC to our office for fixin'.

2204
02:42:24,360 --> 02:42:27,360
F you to Hollywood in general for drowning us with shitty remake movies.

2205
02:42:27,360 --> 02:42:32,360
You're unoriginal, so get out from your asses and give us some original shit.

2206
02:42:32,360 --> 02:42:36,360
LegoGuitar says F you to anyone who sucks.

2207
02:42:36,360 --> 02:42:39,360
I'm in too much of a good mood to think of anything specific.

2208
02:42:39,360 --> 02:42:45,360
And lastly, Sakurina says F you to me because I still haven't unlocked everything on EX2 because I suck.

2209
02:42:45,360 --> 02:42:50,280
And F you to Krista Berg for invading Quebec.

2210
02:42:50,280 --> 02:42:51,280
One more.

2211
02:42:51,280 --> 02:42:55,460
Ron Chan says F you to my, I think it's boss, not boos, F you to my boss who decided to

2212
02:42:55,460 --> 02:42:58,360
show up at my house 30 minutes ago with my paycheck.

2213
02:42:58,360 --> 02:43:02,800
At least you got money out of it.

2214
02:43:02,800 --> 02:43:04,520
All right.

2215
02:43:04,520 --> 02:43:11,280
Thank you for your angst, chat room, you angsty, angsty individuals.

2216
02:43:11,280 --> 02:43:16,760
I want to mention Vote For Us, a five in your player window, on your Live 365 player window.

2217
02:43:16,760 --> 02:43:22,160
Your votes saying that we are a good station really helps us in getting the word out about

2218
02:43:22,160 --> 02:43:23,160
Orange Lounge.

2219
02:43:23,160 --> 02:43:27,560
Also, be sure to visit podcastalley.com and podcast.yahoo.com and vote for our podcast

2220
02:43:27,560 --> 02:43:31,000
there because the more votes we get, the cooler we are.

2221
02:43:31,000 --> 02:43:35,760
There's actually a thread in our forums on orangeloungeradio.com that says how you can

2222
02:43:35,760 --> 02:43:37,280
help promote.

2223
02:43:37,280 --> 02:43:41,920
And so we appreciate all the help that you guys give us.

2224
02:43:41,920 --> 02:43:45,320
One other thing I want to mention for you guys, oh, I missed, I'm sorry, there's one

2225
02:43:45,320 --> 02:43:54,240
more, shit, there's one more F.U. here, I better get to the music here, MPQ says F.U.

2226
02:43:54,240 --> 02:43:59,580
to Sony, so you know about those retarded DRM CDs, yeah it's not enough that they fuck

2227
02:43:59,580 --> 02:44:04,000
up people's computers and not care about it, who knows what a rootkit is, the dumbest thing

2228
02:44:04,000 --> 02:44:06,600
is that this has nothing to do with piracy at all.

2229
02:44:06,600 --> 02:44:08,240
It's a pissing contest against Apple.

2230
02:44:08,240 --> 02:44:10,760
Yes, nothing to do with stopping piracy at all.

2231
02:44:10,760 --> 02:44:13,160
Sony's just pissed because the iPod's beating them.

2232
02:44:13,160 --> 02:44:20,240
Fuck you Sony, you're being fucking idiots, and you've lost my business.

2233
02:44:20,240 --> 02:44:21,240
Better late than never, right?

2234
02:44:21,240 --> 02:44:22,240
All right.

2235
02:44:22,240 --> 02:44:27,680
I want to bring up something that was on the orangelaunchradio.com website earlier this

2236
02:44:27,680 --> 02:44:28,680
week.

2237
02:44:28,680 --> 02:44:29,680
I think this is kind of interesting.

2238
02:44:29,680 --> 02:44:33,440
Konami is launching a new campaign, I thought this was interesting.

2239
02:44:33,440 --> 02:44:38,720
They've launched a brand new website, and it's called Music in Every Direction.

2240
02:44:38,720 --> 02:44:44,200
And we're not really sure what the fuck this is supposed to be, but it is a promo device,

2241
02:44:44,200 --> 02:44:51,800
absolutely, at least, for DDR Extreme 2, Karaoke Revolution Party, and DDR Ultramix 3.

2242
02:44:51,800 --> 02:44:54,760
And you can check this out, it's musicineverydirection.com.

2243
02:44:54,760 --> 02:44:59,880
And all that's there right now are little bitty pictures of all those games, and enter

2244
02:44:59,880 --> 02:45:03,760
your information below to stay up-to-date on the latest Konami music games and receive

2245
02:45:03,760 --> 02:45:10,280
notification when the official website opens. So I'm not sure, so I guess, oh, some people

2246
02:45:10,280 --> 02:45:13,760
are saying they saw a commercial on TV, so is this like their marketing campaign, how

2247
02:45:13,760 --> 02:45:17,460
they're going to market all these games? Loki, you know anything about this? You, you posted

2248
02:45:17,460 --> 02:45:19,280
this to our website, so I thought maybe you'd know.

2249
02:45:19,280 --> 02:45:22,280
I didn't post this to our website. I thought you did. Who did?

2250
02:45:22,280 --> 02:45:24,320
That's what it is. Oh, damn it.

2251
02:45:24,320 --> 02:45:28,600
Copied it on something else. Oh, well. So I guess it's, so it's on TV, I guess I don't

2252
02:45:28,600 --> 02:45:32,040
watch enough TV because I haven't seen these commercials. I haven't seen any either. During

2253
02:45:32,040 --> 02:45:37,160
Elimidate, I saw the Guitar Hero with Loki in Dark Soccer commercial, but I did not see

2254
02:45:37,160 --> 02:45:43,760
the commercial. Yeah, anyway. Oh goody. I'm just waiting for that. I know they're going

2255
02:45:43,760 --> 02:45:48,960
to... You know what I'm buying Guitar Hero with? Hmm? My Best Buy bucks from McDonald's.

2256
02:45:48,960 --> 02:45:51,280
Hell yes!

2257
02:45:51,280 --> 02:45:54,840
I have thirty one dollars of that stuff now.

2258
02:45:54,840 --> 02:45:57,540
Plus fifteen dollars from the uh...

2259
02:45:57,540 --> 02:45:58,840
the puppies.

2260
02:45:58,840 --> 02:46:01,600
Because I bought all three of them and they gave me the food.

2261
02:46:01,600 --> 02:46:04,320
Yeah, I only have to pay like three bucks for the whole thing.

2262
02:46:04,320 --> 02:46:05,600
Not bad, not bad.

2263
02:46:05,600 --> 02:46:09,400
Alright, now I'm curious, what the fuck is this website you're on? Because it's moving by itself.

2264
02:46:09,400 --> 02:46:12,280
It's like, it's a ghost thing. It looks like

2265
02:46:12,280 --> 02:46:14,800
fridge magnet poetry. What the fuck is this site you're on?

2266
02:46:14,800 --> 02:46:18,380
well this is nothing this is just some retarded and have viral campaign and no

2267
02:46:18,380 --> 02:46:21,740
one cares about for the three sixty that

2268
02:46:21,740 --> 02:46:25,300
located i can tell that some of the best way it's like you were talking about

2269
02:46:25,300 --> 02:46:28,240
you know when i look at these came out and stuff

2270
02:46:28,240 --> 02:46:31,540
that was cool because while campaigning was

2271
02:46:31,540 --> 02:46:36,280
kind of unseen in alternate reality gaming was kind of like brand new

2272
02:46:36,280 --> 02:46:40,120
now everybody does it it's not cool anymore so

2273
02:46:40,120 --> 02:46:49,640
Remember hex 168 came out, that 360 site? Well, hexadecimal of 168 is 360.

2274
02:46:49,640 --> 02:46:55,000
This right here in binary is 360, and then there's this stupid thing that you go and

2275
02:46:55,000 --> 02:47:00,520
type and stuff, and basically you can type in this, and there's little binary things,

2276
02:47:00,520 --> 02:47:08,240
and there's a countdown, which, by the way, ends on the 15th, I want to say, at, I believe,

2277
02:47:08,240 --> 02:47:10,840
seven p m pacific time

2278
02:47:10,840 --> 02:47:13,080
uh... where the hell that's going to be great

2279
02:47:13,080 --> 02:47:17,080
uh... so there's a safety type in playing that it teaches of the screen

2280
02:47:17,080 --> 02:47:20,240
where there is the only thing and basically i don't like all my god you

2281
02:47:20,240 --> 02:47:21,000
know it

2282
02:47:21,000 --> 02:47:24,520
it's some you know probably have to figure out now i see just type of stuff

2283
02:47:24,520 --> 02:47:27,600
in and other people type stuff in respond back to you and

2284
02:47:27,600 --> 02:47:30,280
all of them and these can all move around that room

2285
02:47:30,280 --> 02:47:33,480
it's sort of a chairman i think we're actually moving those yet people are

2286
02:47:33,480 --> 02:47:36,560
moving it's like right now i'm gonna move a bunch of these at random

2287
02:47:36,560 --> 02:47:41,460
and there's people off because people are trying to like you know type stuff in here

2288
02:47:41,460 --> 02:47:47,140
and so i am moving them around to break up their sentences to piss them off

2289
02:47:47,140 --> 02:47:48,620
doo doo doo doo doo

2290
02:47:48,620 --> 02:47:50,300
and i'm gonna type poop

2291
02:47:50,300 --> 02:47:55,220
and we're gonna see if that appears no actually see there's firefly

2292
02:47:55,220 --> 02:47:56,740
someone just typed that earlier

2293
02:47:56,740 --> 02:48:00,180
i was doing this the other day i kept typing orange lounge radio over and over

2294
02:48:00,180 --> 02:48:02,420
and over again just for the fuck of it

2295
02:48:02,420 --> 02:48:05,220
because it'll actually appear at one point

2296
02:48:05,220 --> 02:48:07,960
because you know you take it in so many times

2297
02:48:07,960 --> 02:48:09,540
but um...

2298
02:48:09,540 --> 02:48:13,580
so we'll just see if we can get this up here. Have fun with it. What's the website for that again?

2299
02:48:13,580 --> 02:48:20,460
uh... the website for this is www.101101000.com

2300
02:48:20,460 --> 02:48:23,140
slash zero

2301
02:48:23,140 --> 02:48:26,060
Yeah, good luck remembering that. Can you post that in chat please?

2302
02:48:26,060 --> 02:48:30,340
Meanwhile, we're going to go back to the skype line because I promised some folks we'd go to the skype line

2303
02:48:30,340 --> 02:48:31,580
a little later in the show

2304
02:48:31,580 --> 02:48:33,880
and wouldn't you know we already have a call

2305
02:48:33,880 --> 02:48:36,060
Hello, you're on Orange Long's video.

2306
02:48:36,060 --> 02:48:38,000
Hey, what's up? It's Ron Luck.

2307
02:48:38,000 --> 02:48:40,440
Hey, Ron Town, how are you?

2308
02:48:40,440 --> 02:48:43,440
Hello! Hey, how are you everybody? How are you doing?

2309
02:48:43,440 --> 02:48:45,240
What's on your mind?

2310
02:48:45,240 --> 02:48:48,340
Not much. I just want to touch upon a couple of things.

2311
02:48:48,340 --> 02:48:51,240
Xbox 360, if you're going to get one,

2312
02:48:51,240 --> 02:48:55,900
I would suggest if you're on the Best Buy, I would get there about, oh, say,

2313
02:48:55,900 --> 02:48:59,160
five, six a.m.

2314
02:48:59,160 --> 02:49:01,160
That's crazy talk.

2315
02:49:01,160 --> 02:49:09,160
I was there for the PSPs. I got there at 7am to take pictures. There were people there at 6am.

2316
02:49:09,160 --> 02:49:13,160
Now, you also live in New York City, though, so...

2317
02:49:13,160 --> 02:49:14,160
Alright.

2318
02:49:14,160 --> 02:49:21,160
No, no, no, no. This is where I was living in the suburbs. I was in the city there. This was in the suburbs where my best friend opened up.

2319
02:49:21,160 --> 02:49:27,160
And there were people there at 7. We opened the store early just to sell the PSPs.

2320
02:49:27,160 --> 02:49:33,920
Okay, we're having kind of a hard time understanding you, Ron Chan, so you're kind of coming through

2321
02:49:33,920 --> 02:49:34,920
really blurry.

2322
02:49:34,920 --> 02:49:37,400
Also, Rob has suddenly developed an accent.

2323
02:49:37,400 --> 02:49:38,400
I did?

2324
02:49:38,400 --> 02:49:39,400
Yeah.

2325
02:49:39,400 --> 02:49:40,400
Okay.

2326
02:49:40,400 --> 02:49:41,400
What did I say?

2327
02:49:41,400 --> 02:49:42,400
Understand.

2328
02:49:42,400 --> 02:49:43,400
Whatever.

2329
02:49:43,400 --> 02:49:44,400
Whatever.

2330
02:49:44,400 --> 02:49:51,820
Okay, so Ron Chan, do you want to tell us really quick about some Nintendo event you

2331
02:49:51,820 --> 02:49:52,820
went to?

2332
02:49:52,820 --> 02:49:57,820
Yeah, I went to the Nintendo World DDR Ballroom Mix Contest.

2333
02:49:58,820 --> 02:50:00,820
And what happened?

2334
02:50:01,820 --> 02:50:08,820
People got screwed. They had everything developed in different colors, and the top 8 was the least possible result.

2335
02:50:09,820 --> 02:50:17,820
But what happened was, they only did it for 2 rounds. After that, every body in the top 6 had to advance.

2336
02:50:17,820 --> 02:50:21,820
Basically about 30-40 people got screwed out of tournament.

2337
02:50:21,820 --> 02:50:25,780
Oh, that's a bummer, but I guess that's going to happen in probably one of the bigger cities

2338
02:50:25,780 --> 02:50:26,780
or something.

2339
02:50:26,780 --> 02:50:29,900
Anyway, Ron Chen, you're kind of breaking up, I am going to have to let you go, but

2340
02:50:29,900 --> 02:50:33,140
we hope we can talk to you again soon a little later, okay?

2341
02:50:33,140 --> 02:50:34,140
Take care.

2342
02:50:34,140 --> 02:50:35,140
Bye.

2343
02:50:35,140 --> 02:50:36,140
Later.

2344
02:50:36,140 --> 02:50:40,140
Okay, well I think what he said there was about the DDR with Mario event at the official

2345
02:50:40,140 --> 02:50:41,140
Nintendo store.

2346
02:50:41,140 --> 02:50:46,200
It sounds like people got screwed out of it somehow after only a couple rounds.

2347
02:50:46,200 --> 02:50:47,200
That's too bad.

2348
02:50:47,200 --> 02:50:51,340
Loki, you were saying you got Orange Lounge to appear on the site, and it looks like everybody's

2349
02:50:51,340 --> 02:50:53,340
moving to the corners now.

2350
02:50:53,340 --> 02:50:56,340
Yeah, see, there's like 50 people on this right now.

2351
02:50:56,340 --> 02:50:59,340
There's Orange Laundry here. I'm holding it, and I'm shaking it around.

2352
02:50:59,340 --> 02:51:01,340
Uh-huh.

2353
02:51:01,340 --> 02:51:03,340
That's great.

2354
02:51:03,340 --> 02:51:09,340
So our listeners are all on there just shuffling shit into all the corners.

2355
02:51:09,340 --> 02:51:15,340
Beautiful. God, I love our listeners. I so, so love them.

2356
02:51:15,340 --> 02:51:18,340
Another call on Skype line. Hi, you're on Orange Laundry Radio.

2357
02:51:18,340 --> 02:51:21,340
Obviously, I don't need any introduction.

2358
02:51:21,340 --> 02:51:25,340
Not at this point, Mr. Zaku. What's on your mind?

2359
02:51:25,340 --> 02:51:28,340
Uh, just a comment on the little DDR Mario mix thing.

2360
02:51:28,340 --> 02:51:33,340
The reason why people were getting screwed over is because, you know, it's Nintendo World's fault.

2361
02:51:33,340 --> 02:51:38,340
You know, I squarely put the blame on Nintendo World for the fact that they didn't go to DDR Freak

2362
02:51:38,340 --> 02:51:41,340
or any of those sites to advertise a tournament.

2363
02:51:41,340 --> 02:51:46,340
Because if they did that, people, you know, most of us players would have, like,

2364
02:51:46,340 --> 02:51:50,420
like you know straighten out the rules to the point where it would be fair for everyone

2365
02:51:50,420 --> 02:51:53,700
and that's what happens you don't get the you don't get the people that have the experience

2366
02:51:53,700 --> 02:51:59,060
and is involved and thus you know you're misinformed and shit like this happens

2367
02:52:00,500 --> 02:52:07,460
so so they suck yeah but you know the yeah the whole yeah ddr mario mix pretty much you know

2368
02:52:07,460 --> 02:52:12,020
that whole tournament thing you know is a joke okay well ddr mario mix is a joke anyway too

2369
02:52:12,020 --> 02:52:17,020
So what I'm curious about is Saku. Saku, what's the latest on MTV?

2370
02:52:17,020 --> 02:52:19,020
Because you're going to be rich and famous, right?

2371
02:52:19,020 --> 02:52:24,020
Yeah, I got the email. They sent me an email last Thursday. I've already replied to them.

2372
02:52:24,020 --> 02:52:28,020
They're going to be filming next Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday.

2373
02:52:28,020 --> 02:52:33,020
Hopefully I should be able to make it next Wednesday if I get more information from them.

2374
02:52:33,020 --> 02:52:40,020
And then a week after that, during MTV's Gaming Week, aka the Xbox 360 launch week, they will air it.

2375
02:52:40,020 --> 02:52:44,900
Alright, now, if you can somehow get Orange Lounge in there, whether it be like a picture

2376
02:52:44,900 --> 02:52:48,980
in the background, or, you know, you're name dropping it, or somehow Orange Lounge gets

2377
02:52:48,980 --> 02:52:49,980
in there, I will...

2378
02:52:49,980 --> 02:52:51,980
Dude, if you send me an OLR shirt, I will wear it.

2379
02:52:51,980 --> 02:52:52,980
I will mail you...

2380
02:52:52,980 --> 02:52:53,980
Seriously.

2381
02:52:53,980 --> 02:52:54,980
You will get one of the...

2382
02:52:54,980 --> 02:52:58,420
If you will make me an extra large shirt that says, in black, that says Orange Lounge radio

2383
02:52:58,420 --> 02:53:01,660
on it, I would definitely wear, I would definitely wear that shirt out.

2384
02:53:01,660 --> 02:53:02,660
Damn it.

2385
02:53:02,660 --> 02:53:09,940
Maybe, I don't know if we can get it done in time, but I will, I'll send you a dollar.

2386
02:53:09,940 --> 02:53:17,240
Also, 1UP.com is saying that BeatMania is being pushed up early to the 15th of February

2387
02:53:17,240 --> 02:53:20,140
of next year.

2388
02:53:20,140 --> 02:53:24,660
I do not know of any changes inside Konami as far as I know.

2389
02:53:24,660 --> 02:53:28,100
Well, I know what 1UP.com is saying, but I don't mean I agree with it.

2390
02:53:28,100 --> 02:53:29,100
We'll see.

2391
02:53:29,100 --> 02:53:30,100
We'll see.

2392
02:53:30,100 --> 02:53:31,100
Maybe.

2393
02:53:31,100 --> 02:53:35,740
I could see it getting bumped up, but as far as I know, it's not done yet, so we'll see.

2394
02:53:35,740 --> 02:53:36,740
Alright.

2395
02:53:36,740 --> 02:53:39,300
Well, Zachary, we're gonna let you go.

2396
02:53:39,300 --> 02:53:48,300
Just do whatever. Just see if you could try to send me a shirt or something. I seriously would allow you to use me as a billboard or some sort of advertising.

2397
02:53:48,300 --> 02:53:51,300
We want to do the shirt thing so bad, but it's just a costume.

2398
02:53:51,300 --> 02:53:54,300
Or something like that, but just...

2399
02:53:54,300 --> 02:53:57,300
Alright. Alright, Zach, we're going to let you go, okay? Have a good one.

2400
02:53:57,300 --> 02:53:59,300
You know, just think about it, man.

2401
02:53:59,300 --> 02:54:02,300
I know. We'll get it. Alright, take care.

2402
02:54:02,300 --> 02:54:03,300
Rob, later.

2403
02:54:03,300 --> 02:54:05,300
Alright, just so you know...

2404
02:54:05,300 --> 02:54:07,300
What's going on now on the site? We've got like tons of people on the site.

2405
02:54:07,300 --> 02:54:20,540
Yeah, it's really funny. The name of the page, the title, it is 101101000 slash zero, and

2406
02:54:20,540 --> 02:54:22,420
then colon, it's so much fun.

2407
02:54:22,420 --> 02:54:27,740
What? Somebody actually put it so much fun on there?

2408
02:54:27,740 --> 02:54:35,060
No, I think it just, I don't know how it appeared on there, but it just says it's so much fun.

2409
02:54:35,060 --> 02:54:37,060
That's great.

2410
02:54:37,060 --> 02:54:41,640
So I gotta watch this. What is going on here? So everybody's on the site just like shuffling around.

2411
02:54:41,640 --> 02:54:51,960
Zombie butt, I love Ross, goat, goat say love, orange love Japan, so...

2412
02:54:51,960 --> 02:54:53,320
No, you don't, you fucker, like, look.

2413
02:54:53,320 --> 02:54:55,760
That's great. Jamie's fighting with somebody.

2414
02:54:55,760 --> 02:54:58,960
The Burger King's touching orange round, stop!

2415
02:54:58,960 --> 02:55:01,760
I'm trying to get me on there, but it's not working.

2416
02:55:01,760 --> 02:55:03,960
You guys are crazy. You need bleached asshole on there.

2417
02:55:03,960 --> 02:55:05,560
Oh, there I am. There's, there's...

2418
02:55:05,560 --> 02:55:07,560
Somebody already clicked and dragged you away.

2419
02:55:07,560 --> 02:55:09,560
I'm putting me in the corner.

2420
02:55:09,560 --> 02:55:11,560
That's me in the corner.

2421
02:55:11,560 --> 02:55:12,560
We'll get Sky in there now.

2422
02:55:12,560 --> 02:55:13,560
Alright, great.

2423
02:55:13,560 --> 02:55:15,560
You kids have fun with that, but not too much.

2424
02:55:15,560 --> 02:55:17,560
Let's try to take one more call, at least one more.

2425
02:55:17,560 --> 02:55:19,560
This is going to be another phone once, I don't know if this will work, we'll see.

2426
02:55:19,560 --> 02:55:21,560
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

2427
02:55:21,560 --> 02:55:23,560
Hey, it's Jazz.

2428
02:55:23,560 --> 02:55:25,560
Hey, Jazz, what's on your mind, my friend?

2429
02:55:25,560 --> 02:55:27,560
Uh, not much.

2430
02:55:27,560 --> 02:55:31,560
I was just, uh, I have some thoughts about the Xbox 360 and everything.

2431
02:55:31,560 --> 02:55:34,560
Please, tell us your thoughts on the Xbox 360.

2432
02:55:34,560 --> 02:55:40,560
I saw it at Best Buy, and it looked like crap.

2433
02:55:40,560 --> 02:55:42,560
And what?

2434
02:55:42,560 --> 02:55:43,560
It looked like crap.

2435
02:55:43,560 --> 02:55:45,560
What was wrong with it?

2436
02:55:45,560 --> 02:55:53,560
It was really laggy. They were playing King Kong, and everything was running at 15 FPS at that.

2437
02:55:53,560 --> 02:55:56,560
It looked like me playing Final Fantasy XI in lower Juno.

2438
02:55:56,560 --> 02:56:03,560
Yeah, basically. It was really bad. I was like, damn, this is what everybody worked it up about.

2439
02:56:03,560 --> 02:56:06,560
So needless to say, you're not going to be buying an Xbox 360?

2440
02:56:06,560 --> 02:56:08,560
Not at the moment, no.

2441
02:56:08,560 --> 02:56:12,560
Nuh-uh. I'm going to stick with my ghetto, broken-down Xbox for now.

2442
02:56:12,560 --> 02:56:14,560
I know what he's going to do instead.

2443
02:56:14,560 --> 02:56:15,560
What?

2444
02:56:15,560 --> 02:56:16,560
What?

2445
02:56:16,560 --> 02:56:22,560
Uh, what did you just buy last week? Hint. Nudge. Elbow.

2446
02:56:22,560 --> 02:56:24,560
Uh, R-Hero?

2447
02:56:24,560 --> 02:56:26,560
No! You bought one month of what?

2448
02:56:26,560 --> 02:56:28,560
Oh no!

2449
02:56:28,560 --> 02:56:31,560
Light goes on. He won the Warcraft.

2450
02:56:31,560 --> 02:56:33,560
I know, I got sucked in for another month.

2451
02:56:33,560 --> 02:56:35,560
Congratulations on that, by the way.

2452
02:56:35,560 --> 02:56:36,560
I know.

2453
02:56:36,560 --> 02:56:39,560
Man, I wasn't even there for five minutes last week.

2454
02:56:39,560 --> 02:56:40,560
What show are you on?

2455
02:56:40,560 --> 02:56:41,560
Uh...

2456
02:56:41,560 --> 02:56:44,560
Yeah, I'm not telling it on air, but yeah.

2457
02:56:44,560 --> 02:56:48,560
Alright.

2458
02:56:48,560 --> 02:56:53,560
So, speaking of Guitar Hero, we gotta finish the show here pretty quick,

2459
02:56:53,560 --> 02:56:55,560
but really quickly, your thoughts on Guitar Hero?

2460
02:56:55,560 --> 02:56:56,560
I think it's great.

2461
02:56:56,560 --> 02:57:00,560
I think it's leaps and bounds better than Guitar Freaks ever was.

2462
02:57:00,560 --> 02:57:06,780
Just because of the fact that it's not all pictured J-Pop, and I think that feels a lot

2463
02:57:06,780 --> 02:57:07,780
more to people.

2464
02:57:07,780 --> 02:57:11,780
Besides that, yeah, it's a great game.

2465
02:57:11,780 --> 02:57:13,900
Yeah, it's definitely different than Guitar Freak.

2466
02:57:13,900 --> 02:57:16,340
Certainly a different song list that's going to appeal to a whole different audience.

2467
02:57:16,340 --> 02:57:19,060
Alright, well, Jazz, we've got to go because we've got to wrap up the show, but thanks

2468
02:57:19,060 --> 02:57:21,060
so much for calling in, okay?

2469
02:57:21,060 --> 02:57:22,060
Alright, bye.

2470
02:57:22,060 --> 02:57:23,060
Alright, later.

2471
02:57:23,060 --> 02:57:24,060
Bye!

2472
02:57:24,060 --> 02:57:26,060
Alright, that's going to do it for our Skype calls tonight.

2473
02:57:26,060 --> 02:57:30,660
Okay, now's the part of the show where we're going to go around and get everybody's final

2474
02:57:30,660 --> 02:57:34,300
thoughts, because it's that time of the show where we're almost done.

2475
02:57:34,300 --> 02:57:36,660
So we're going to start it off by going over to Angel.

2476
02:57:36,660 --> 02:57:44,100
Angel, what is your final thought of the evening?

2477
02:57:44,100 --> 02:57:46,940
Must buy Guitar Hero.

2478
02:57:46,940 --> 02:57:52,140
Anyway, uh, Loki.

2479
02:57:52,140 --> 02:57:56,340
I've lost where my name went on this page.

2480
02:57:56,340 --> 02:57:57,180
Oh, there we are.

2481
02:57:57,180 --> 02:58:00,900
Whoa, I have like three names on there now.

2482
02:58:00,900 --> 02:58:03,900
It says Loki as goat say.

2483
02:58:03,900 --> 02:58:05,420
Awesome.

2484
02:58:05,420 --> 02:58:09,620
My final thought is ciabatta bread is yummy.

2485
02:58:09,620 --> 02:58:11,620
It's my favorite thing ever.

2486
02:58:11,620 --> 02:58:14,180
And DarkSakura, your final thought.

2487
02:58:14,180 --> 02:58:18,980
Rejectable cyclones, somebody send me to London.

2488
02:58:18,980 --> 02:58:21,380
All right, that's going to do it for tonight's show.

02:58:36,580 --> 02:58:41,180

2493
02:58:41,180 --> 02:58:44,260
is not an easy one to fill so we'll have to get like five people to all sit in it

02:58:52,940 --> 02:58:56,940
Alright, the final word of tonight's program,

2497
02:58:56,940 --> 02:59:00,940
I'll give it to Loki, because I haven't given the final word of the program

2498
02:59:00,940 --> 02:59:04,940
to Loki in a while, so Loki, one word to sum it all up, and we'll see the kids next week.

2499

Zombie butts.

2504
02:59:37,940 --> 02:59:41,940
So dangerous, so dangerous, he fights the law.

02:59:41,940 --> 02:59:45,940
But he also fights the crime, but not as much, DANGERESQUE!

The mighty oak has fallen

He works alone

2519

He's a private eye, a crooked cop, a secret agent, and a celebrity pharmacist, Danger-esque.

2520
03:00:46,940 --> 03:00:55,940
That guy is Danger-esque, Danger-esque, Danger-esque, Danger-esque.
