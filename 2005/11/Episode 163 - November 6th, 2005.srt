00:04:15,654 --> 00:04:18,215
[SPEAKER_04]: I just... This microphone is so weird, I can't stand it.

9
00:04:18,275 --> 00:04:23,178
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway... Anyway... This microphone is heavy and I can club baby seals with it.

10
00:04:24,735 --> 00:04:26,137
[SPEAKER_04]: Can I do the introduction, please?

11
00:04:26,157 --> 00:04:26,658

00:06:03,825 --> 00:06:04,705
[SPEAKER_28]: Just kidding.

26
00:06:04,805 --> 00:06:08,527
[SPEAKER_28]: Orange Lounge Radio will not contain any of that in this episode.

00:06:08,607 --> 00:06:10,488

00:07:17,526 --> 00:07:18,006
[SPEAKER_29]: How you doing?

38
00:07:19,107 --> 00:07:20,167
[SPEAKER_07]: This microphone is heavy.

39
00:07:22,209 --> 00:07:23,730
[SPEAKER_07]: I also drink the blood of young virgins.

40
00:07:24,650 --> 00:07:24,991
Hot.

41
00:07:25,751 --> 00:07:26,992
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm having it for dinner right now.

42
00:07:27,012 --> 00:07:27,892
[SPEAKER_07]: It's salad dressing.

43
00:07:28,933 --> 00:07:29,233
[SPEAKER_03]: Awesome.

44
00:07:29,854 --> 00:07:33,056
[SPEAKER_07]: At least that's what I think that they use in their salad dressings at McDonald's.

45
00:07:33,076 --> 00:07:34,577
[SPEAKER_07]: It has to be something that tastes fairly...

46
00:07:35,546 --> 00:07:39,550
[SPEAKER_04]: We may have to switch mics, because for some reason that one's not picking you up so well.

47
00:07:40,471 --> 00:07:41,512
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's do this.

48
00:07:41,752 --> 00:07:44,895
[SPEAKER_04]: Just make sure when you're talking, the little switch is out this way, otherwise it won't pick you up.

49
00:07:47,678 --> 00:07:49,860
[SPEAKER_04]: This is my microphone.

50
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:52,162
[SPEAKER_04]: I know, but I switched it because we had trouble.

51
00:07:52,182 --> 00:07:53,644
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't change things on me!

52
00:07:54,244 --> 00:07:55,385
[SPEAKER_07]: It makes me anxious.

53
00:07:56,386 --> 00:07:58,488
[SPEAKER_07]: And when I get anxious, people die.

54
00:07:59,029 --> 00:07:59,850
[SPEAKER_04]: They're all going to get you.

55
00:08:00,905 --> 00:08:01,245
[SPEAKER_04]: Huh?

56
00:08:28,627 --> 00:08:28,727
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh.

57
00:08:29,087 --> 00:08:29,548
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, Loki.

58
00:08:29,568 --> 00:08:31,189
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for joining our program tonight.

59
00:08:31,229 --> 00:08:32,149
[SPEAKER_04]: We appreciate it.

60
00:08:33,270 --> 00:08:33,650
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

61
00:08:34,251 --> 00:08:34,831
[SPEAKER_04]: Glad to be here.

62
00:08:35,592 --> 00:08:37,213
[SPEAKER_04]: Fucking RARC work!

63
00:08:39,754 --> 00:08:41,415
[SPEAKER_04]: Something is wrong with my microphone.

64
00:08:41,435 --> 00:08:43,096
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, I'm not as loud as I usually am.

65
00:08:43,897 --> 00:08:44,377
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank God.

66
00:08:45,538 --> 00:08:46,679
[SPEAKER_04]: Check, check, check, check.

67
00:08:46,719 --> 00:08:47,219
[SPEAKER_04]: There we go.

68
00:08:47,379 --> 00:08:47,759
[SPEAKER_04]: There we go.

69
00:08:47,899 --> 00:08:48,540
[SPEAKER_04]: Now I can hear myself.

70
00:08:51,055 --> 00:08:52,196
[SPEAKER_04]: This internet sucks.

71
00:08:52,696 --> 00:08:53,176
[SPEAKER_04]: It really does.

72
00:08:53,276 --> 00:08:53,577
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

73
00:08:53,917 --> 00:08:58,660
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, now that we've got our sound issues worked out, we can actually have ourselves a little bit of a show tonight.

74
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:02,863
[SPEAKER_04]: I know I want to talk a lot about Guitar Hero because it's really cool.

75
00:09:04,054 --> 00:09:06,536
[SPEAKER_04]: and we're also going to talk about, of course, our weeks and our day.

76
00:09:06,936 --> 00:09:14,460
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to talk about a cool interview that we're going to have on tonight's podcast and then we're going to talk about whatever tickles our fancy.

77
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:16,241
[SPEAKER_07]: And then we're going to set a guitar on fire.

78
00:09:16,781 --> 00:09:17,362
[SPEAKER_04]: We just might.

79
00:09:17,762 --> 00:09:21,584
[SPEAKER_04]: But first, say hello to our special guests because it wouldn't be a show if we didn't have some special guests.

80
00:09:22,064 --> 00:09:23,185
[SPEAKER_04]: Say hello to Bugged.

81
00:09:24,746 --> 00:09:25,306
[SPEAKER_04]: Hello to Bugged.

82
00:09:25,966 --> 00:09:27,707
[SPEAKER_04]: And also say hello to DDR Angel.

83
00:09:28,228 --> 00:09:28,608
[SPEAKER_07]: Hello.

84
00:09:29,148 --> 00:09:30,329
[SPEAKER_07]: My salad just exploded.

85
00:09:31,516 --> 00:09:32,296
[SPEAKER_04]: That sounds hot.

86
00:09:33,997 --> 00:09:34,637
[SPEAKER_07]: You don't want to know.

87
00:09:37,018 --> 00:09:39,878
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, and Xtifer's around as well.

88
00:09:39,938 --> 00:09:42,739
[SPEAKER_04]: He might pop in a little later in the show, hopefully to give us a movie review.

89
00:09:42,859 --> 00:09:44,000
[SPEAKER_04]: He's fondling his new Mac.

90
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:46,520
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, he's making sweet love to his new Macintosh.

91
00:09:46,540 --> 00:09:51,462
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm going to get one soon, too.

92
00:09:52,222 --> 00:09:53,202
[SPEAKER_04]: Another.

93
00:09:53,402 --> 00:09:53,682
[SPEAKER_04]: Another.

94
00:09:54,463 --> 00:09:54,743
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

95
00:09:55,543 --> 00:09:59,324
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll be back after this quick introduction to talk about us.

96
00:10:00,319 --> 00:10:01,919
[SPEAKER_04]: and what's going on in the video game world.

97
00:10:01,939 --> 00:10:02,499
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll be back.

98
00:10:03,260 --> 00:10:08,321
[SPEAKER_04]: I figured we could maybe continue the theme of the pre-show tonight because the pre-show tonight was a lot of disco music.

99
00:10:08,741 --> 00:10:10,881
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're going to continue on and get down.

100
00:10:11,561 --> 00:10:15,242
[SPEAKER_04]: I just needed to culture everybody because the Saturday Night Fever soundtrack is fabulous.

101
00:10:15,502 --> 00:10:16,242
[SPEAKER_04]: It is great.

102
00:10:16,342 --> 00:10:18,122
[SPEAKER_04]: So let's get down right now.

[SPEAKER_07]: How to run a radio show.

123
00:16:32,753 --> 00:16:33,234
[SPEAKER_04]: Hello?

124
00:16:33,894 --> 00:16:35,355
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't understand this.

125
00:16:35,936 --> 00:16:36,737
[SPEAKER_04]: Does this thing work?

126
00:16:36,757 --> 00:16:38,358
[SPEAKER_07]: This thing reads like stereo instructions.

127
00:16:38,418 --> 00:16:39,019
[SPEAKER_07]: Is this on?

128
00:16:39,039 --> 00:16:39,639
[SPEAKER_07]: What the hell?

129
00:16:42,181 --> 00:16:43,603
[SPEAKER_01]: Orange Lounge Radio.

130
00:16:43,783 --> 00:16:45,845
[SPEAKER_01]: Broke Down Ghetto Bomani Radio.

131
00:16:47,369 --> 00:16:57,532
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi kids, we're back here on Orange Lounge Radio, and I know we've been having some mic problems tonight or something, so we tried fixing it a little bit during the break, so I hope that our mic quality is a little better now.

132
00:16:58,072 --> 00:16:59,932
[SPEAKER_04]: But if not, you'll just have to deal with it, I guess.

133
00:17:00,292 --> 00:17:00,612
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

134
00:17:00,892 --> 00:17:02,213
[SPEAKER_04]: We tried to patch some things up.

135
00:17:02,353 --> 00:17:03,813
[SPEAKER_04]: We kicked Mike out and replaced him.

136
00:17:04,233 --> 00:17:04,653
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that's right.

137
00:17:04,673 --> 00:17:05,013
[SPEAKER_04]: We fired.

138
00:17:05,033 --> 00:17:05,433
[SPEAKER_04]: FIRED!

139
00:17:06,714 --> 00:17:08,714
[SPEAKER_04]: So hopefully things are a little better now.

140
00:17:09,654 --> 00:17:12,615
[SPEAKER_07]: We would like you to know that those responsible have just been sacked.

141
00:17:13,175 --> 00:17:15,396
[SPEAKER_02]: And those who did the sacking have also been sacked.

142
00:17:16,661 --> 00:17:17,222
[SPEAKER_02]: At Infinium.

143
00:17:17,583 --> 00:17:20,148
[SPEAKER_02]: As suddenly a giant foot comes crashing down on our program.

144
00:17:20,228 --> 00:17:23,535
[SPEAKER_07]: We will now continue the rest of this program in a flashy manner and at great expense.

145
00:17:25,018 --> 00:17:25,780
[SPEAKER_02]: I hate you guys.

146
00:17:26,461 --> 00:17:26,721
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway.

147
00:17:28,271 --> 00:17:29,331
[SPEAKER_04]: That's why they haven't kicked us out, right?

148
00:17:29,472 --> 00:17:30,312
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

149
00:17:30,432 --> 00:17:36,475
[SPEAKER_04]: Moving on, I want to get into this real quickly because we were talking about this a little bit during the break before we get into a little bit of How's Your Week, How's Your Day.

150
00:17:36,775 --> 00:17:41,657
[SPEAKER_04]: But Loki's randomly surfing the internet as he does when he's on this program because he doesn't really like to participate in the program.

151
00:17:42,037 --> 00:17:44,758
[SPEAKER_04]: He just surfs the internet randomly and giggles once in a while in the corner.

152
00:17:45,278 --> 00:17:48,079
[SPEAKER_04]: So, Loki, what was this article you found about the AOL guy?

153
00:17:49,140 --> 00:17:50,400
[SPEAKER_04]: You found an article about the AOL guy?

154
00:17:50,841 --> 00:17:56,303
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, the AOL guy is now, he's basically selling himself to make,

155
00:17:56,966 --> 00:18:00,148
[SPEAKER_22]: You know, custom WAV files for your email programs or what have you.

156
00:18:00,789 --> 00:18:07,733
[SPEAKER_22]: Um, and he's charging, I believe, was it like $12 for, um, per WAV file or something like that.

157
00:18:08,394 --> 00:18:08,934
[SPEAKER_22]: Let me see here.

158
00:18:08,954 --> 00:18:09,575
[SPEAKER_22]: I can't remember.

159
00:18:09,595 --> 00:18:10,996
[SPEAKER_07]: He's already sold himself to the devil.

160
00:18:11,036 --> 00:18:12,637
[SPEAKER_07]: He may as well sell himself to everybody else.

161
00:18:13,417 --> 00:18:16,179
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, he was... Can you get him to say anything?

162
00:18:16,659 --> 00:18:18,120
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I have no idea.

163
00:18:18,220 --> 00:18:23,044
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, could I make him record a WAV file and send it to my ex that goes, You've got herpes!

164
00:18:25,070 --> 00:18:34,195
[SPEAKER_04]: It says, let's see here, yeah, one WAV file, it would be $12 for a non-AOL file, $30 for five files, so that's a little break there.

165
00:18:34,816 --> 00:18:45,263
[SPEAKER_22]: It says, basically, it doesn't really say what else he'll do, just pretty much whatever, I guess, you want.

166
00:18:46,724 --> 00:18:48,144
[SPEAKER_29]: Is there a limit to the number of words he'll say?

167
00:18:50,814 --> 00:18:56,456
[SPEAKER_22]: I don't know, it doesn't say, um, so, I guess if you're gonna order... I don't mind if I'm singing, I'm a little teapot.

168
00:18:59,777 --> 00:19:01,918
[SPEAKER_29]: I'm a little teapot, shorthand stout.

169
00:19:02,878 --> 00:19:04,839
[SPEAKER_29]: You've got mail, you've got hot tea.

170
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:07,000
[SPEAKER_29]: Anyway.

171
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:15,323
[SPEAKER_22]: I think he'll do, like, you've got mail and stuff, like, he'll do, like, um, you know, you've got mail, Bob, or you've got mail...

172
00:19:16,912 --> 00:19:17,753
[SPEAKER_04]: You've got served.

173
00:19:39,736 --> 00:19:41,738
[SPEAKER_04]: EXERCIEXECON or something.

174
00:19:41,878 --> 00:19:46,062
[SPEAKER_04]: You just make it up and when he doesn't say it right, you go, no you bastard, that's not my name.

175
00:19:46,382 --> 00:19:49,485
[SPEAKER_07]: Emphasis on the X. Some ancient Egyptian name.

176
00:19:50,586 --> 00:19:53,269
[SPEAKER_07]: Or like my... Awesome.

177
00:19:53,789 --> 00:19:55,111
[SPEAKER_07]: So, yeah.

178
00:19:55,131 --> 00:19:57,573
[SPEAKER_07]: Make him pronounce something in Welsh, he'll totally screw it up.

179
00:19:58,574 --> 00:19:59,475
[SPEAKER_04]: In a foreign language.

180
00:19:59,495 --> 00:20:03,759
[SPEAKER_22]: Can you imagine what it must be like as him, you know, it's just...

181
00:20:04,650 --> 00:20:06,250
[SPEAKER_22]: It's just really bad stuff.

182
00:20:06,310 --> 00:20:09,071
[SPEAKER_22]: I mean, you know, he's all making love to his wife.

183
00:20:09,431 --> 00:20:09,991
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yeah.

184
00:20:10,872 --> 00:20:11,772
[SPEAKER_04]: Just really weird.

185
00:20:12,192 --> 00:20:13,232
[SPEAKER_04]: He's got a weird voice.

186
00:20:13,412 --> 00:20:14,312
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm saying that.

187
00:20:14,432 --> 00:20:16,113
[SPEAKER_07]: I only get hot when you say it.

188
00:20:16,213 --> 00:20:17,613
[SPEAKER_07]: You've got mail.

189
00:20:19,054 --> 00:20:27,796
[SPEAKER_22]: It's like, remember, it was Carlos, not Carlos Mencia, but Paulo Francisco and the movie guy, the movie voice guy, and him, you know.

190
00:20:27,816 --> 00:20:30,136
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yeah, that's an old, yeah.

191
00:20:30,156 --> 00:20:30,816
[SPEAKER_22]: The passion.

192
00:20:32,057 --> 00:20:32,277
[SPEAKER_22]: Anyways.

193
00:20:33,254 --> 00:20:33,574
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura

194
00:20:50,905 --> 00:20:52,786
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not even a well-put-together basket.

195
00:20:52,906 --> 00:20:56,528
[SPEAKER_07]: It was sort of like a mildewed basket like you find in the thrift store.

196
00:20:58,028 --> 00:20:58,209
[SPEAKER_02]: Ew.

197
00:20:58,669 --> 00:21:00,089
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

198
00:21:01,210 --> 00:21:04,151
[SPEAKER_07]: I went to the doctor Tuesday with a migraine.

199
00:21:05,572 --> 00:21:07,953
[SPEAKER_07]: And so now I found out that my brain might be broken.

200
00:21:08,934 --> 00:21:10,895
[SPEAKER_07]: So I get to go in for a CT scan on Monday.

201
00:21:13,036 --> 00:21:13,536
[SPEAKER_07]: Fun, huh?

202
00:21:16,517 --> 00:21:17,518
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't want to make a joke.

203
00:21:18,482 --> 00:21:21,344
[SPEAKER_04]: But I have to say this, it's not the tumor.

204
00:21:21,844 --> 00:21:25,047
[SPEAKER_07]: I've been doing, I eat, you, I eat fat in the car.

205
00:21:26,067 --> 00:21:29,009
[SPEAKER_07]: The only time my headache wasn't present was when I was really drunk.

206
00:21:30,471 --> 00:21:32,732
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't want to come across as insensitive to the listeners, so.

207
00:21:33,313 --> 00:21:35,374
[SPEAKER_22]: I have the diagnosis.

208
00:21:36,195 --> 00:21:38,736
[SPEAKER_22]: You're allergic to sobriety.

209
00:21:40,718 --> 00:21:42,319
[SPEAKER_04]: That's probably it.

210
00:21:43,059 --> 00:21:43,960
[SPEAKER_04]: I know, I'm so smart.

211
00:21:44,340 --> 00:21:45,401
[SPEAKER_04]: That'll be $50, please.

212
00:21:46,942 --> 00:21:47,422
[SPEAKER_04]: Guess what?

213
00:21:47,703 --> 00:21:48,023
[SPEAKER_04]: Bite me.

214
00:21:49,025 --> 00:21:57,208
[SPEAKER_07]: Biller Insurance I'll tell you, Bill, that I can't say it on the air.

215
00:21:58,388 --> 00:21:59,789
[SPEAKER_04]: I played Guitar Hero and lots of it.

216
00:22:00,509 --> 00:22:02,390
[SPEAKER_04]: You're going to have to drink the thing that tastes like chalk?

217
00:22:04,131 --> 00:22:04,711
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

218
00:22:05,351 --> 00:22:07,332
[SPEAKER_07]: Because they're testing my brain.

219
00:22:08,292 --> 00:22:08,852
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll be fine.

220
00:22:08,872 --> 00:22:09,433
[SPEAKER_02]: You'll be fine.

221
00:22:09,553 --> 00:22:10,653
[SPEAKER_07]: I have a headache right now, too.

222
00:22:10,813 --> 00:22:15,655
[SPEAKER_07]: I have the same headache that I have had since Friday the week before.

223
00:22:17,358 --> 00:22:21,040
[SPEAKER_07]: So, I'm not very happy, and they put me on stuff for migraines.

224
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:27,482
[SPEAKER_22]: They should put a couple pills underneath her head, so, you know, this is your brain, this is your brain on drugs.

225
00:22:28,543 --> 00:22:28,883
[SPEAKER_22]: Hehe.

226
00:22:30,044 --> 00:22:31,524
[SPEAKER_22]: This doesn't even make sense.

227
00:22:32,084 --> 00:22:37,007
[SPEAKER_22]: Her brain is on drugs, therefore when she's getting whatever, you know, cat scan or whatever.

228
00:22:37,027 --> 00:22:39,548
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, okay, I got it, the egg, okay.

229
00:22:39,888 --> 00:22:42,269
[SPEAKER_07]: I have a magnet that says, this is your brain.

230
00:22:44,292 --> 00:22:47,174
[SPEAKER_07]: and then this is your brain with a piece of toast and bacon.

231
00:22:50,697 --> 00:22:54,780
[SPEAKER_04]: I haven't gotten, you know, a little known fact, I actually collect fridge magnets.

232
00:22:55,791 --> 00:22:56,031
[SPEAKER_04]: Magnet House

233
00:23:21,508 --> 00:23:22,969
[SPEAKER_04]: I love that store.

234
00:23:23,109 --> 00:23:23,870
[SPEAKER_04]: It's awesome.

235
00:23:24,110 --> 00:23:24,931
[SPEAKER_04]: Magnets are cool.

236
00:23:25,371 --> 00:23:26,732
[SPEAKER_04]: The bumper stickers of my fridge.

237
00:23:26,752 --> 00:23:27,933
[SPEAKER_07]: Back to my broken brain.

238
00:23:29,955 --> 00:23:30,175
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, sorry.

239
00:23:30,195 --> 00:23:30,435
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, sorry.

240
00:23:30,575 --> 00:23:34,618
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that our listeners are probably very amused that they found out what I was actually on.

241
00:23:34,839 --> 00:23:35,899
[SPEAKER_07]: They keep saying Vicodin.

242
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:37,220
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not on Vicodin.

243
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:40,223
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm on something else that I'm not going to tell you what I'm on.

244
00:23:40,523 --> 00:23:41,244
[SPEAKER_07]: But they would laugh.

245
00:23:42,504 --> 00:23:45,187
[SPEAKER_07]: Because it's the last thing anyone ever expected me to be taken.

246
00:23:45,847 --> 00:23:46,608
[SPEAKER_04]: Like Prozac?

247
00:23:46,648 --> 00:23:46,908
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually.

248
00:23:48,882 --> 00:23:49,242
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

249
00:23:49,422 --> 00:23:49,803
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

250
00:23:50,083 --> 00:23:52,464
[SPEAKER_07]: It's actually called triple whiskey shots.

251
00:23:52,984 --> 00:23:53,344
[SPEAKER_04]: Awesome.

252
00:23:55,425 --> 00:23:58,386
[SPEAKER_07]: At least I wish that they had triple whiskey shots in the pill so you don't get the burn.

253
00:23:58,446 --> 00:23:59,767
[SPEAKER_07]: You just take the whiskey pill.

254
00:24:01,327 --> 00:24:01,647
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

255
00:24:02,288 --> 00:24:08,930
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I hope you go to the doctor and everything is okay and they just find that they need to let the hamster out or something.

256
00:24:09,050 --> 00:24:09,370
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

257
00:24:10,351 --> 00:24:12,992
[SPEAKER_07]: Dude, if they gave me morphine, I'd be freaking happy.

258
00:24:14,212 --> 00:24:14,492
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

259
00:24:14,653 --> 00:24:16,533
[SPEAKER_07]: Anything else you want to share about your week and your day?

260
00:24:16,753 --> 00:24:17,554
[SPEAKER_07]: I need a new job.

261
00:24:18,726 --> 00:24:20,509
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, now hiring.

262
00:24:21,711 --> 00:24:23,113
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki, how was your week?

263
00:24:23,133 --> 00:24:23,594
[SPEAKER_04]: How was your day?

264
00:24:25,597 --> 00:24:26,920
[SPEAKER_22]: My week was pretty good.

265
00:24:29,163 --> 00:24:31,447
[SPEAKER_22]: The entire week was basically filled with...

266
00:24:32,765 --> 00:24:56,413
[SPEAKER_22]: Work and playing deathmatches in Grand Theft Auto Liberty City Stories, because my boss loves Grand Theft Auto, and so now, instead of taking a 15 minute break and playing something, we go down into the theater and play a four player multiplayer deathmatch on Grand Theft Auto Liberty City Stories and take a half an hour break, and it's okay because the boss is there too, so, hell yeah.

267
00:24:57,093 --> 00:24:57,954
[SPEAKER_22]: Do that twice a day.

268
00:24:58,414 --> 00:24:58,554
[SPEAKER_22]: So,

269
00:24:59,688 --> 00:25:00,348
[SPEAKER_22]: That's pretty fun.

270
00:25:02,109 --> 00:25:16,152
[SPEAKER_22]: As promised, I have made sure to participate in the Biggest Loser thing, and I'm happy to say that I have eaten fast food every single day this week to meet my Quora.

271
00:25:17,352 --> 00:25:21,373
[SPEAKER_22]: And yeah, other than that, really not too much else.

272
00:25:21,513 --> 00:25:22,813
[SPEAKER_29]: You've got heart problems!

273
00:25:23,633 --> 00:25:24,614
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm fine.

274
00:25:25,514 --> 00:25:25,814
[SPEAKER_22]: Shit.

275
00:25:27,642 --> 00:25:29,083
[SPEAKER_22]: I went and saw Saw 2 last night.

276
00:25:29,663 --> 00:25:31,224
[SPEAKER_22]: I have to say, though, I was quite disappointed.

277
00:25:31,264 --> 00:25:32,805
[SPEAKER_22]: It wasn't as gory as I thought it would be.

278
00:25:34,226 --> 00:25:35,226
[SPEAKER_22]: It really was a letdown.

279
00:25:36,407 --> 00:25:38,048
[SPEAKER_22]: I mean, I don't know what everyone is saying.

280
00:25:38,128 --> 00:25:41,630
[SPEAKER_22]: I was expecting, like, you know, fountains of blood.

281
00:25:41,670 --> 00:25:47,033
[SPEAKER_22]: There is not even nearly enough blood in that, or gore, or anything.

282
00:25:48,094 --> 00:25:50,875
[SPEAKER_22]: So, they really are going to have to impress me with Saw 3.

283
00:25:51,456 --> 00:25:52,977
[SPEAKER_04]: And you know there's going to be a Saw 3.

284
00:25:53,297 --> 00:25:53,757
[SPEAKER_22]: Oh, yeah.

285
00:25:53,957 --> 00:25:55,358
[SPEAKER_22]: Stupid bitch.

286
00:25:55,728 --> 00:26:02,490
[SPEAKER_22]: They shouldn't have given the main guy cancer or it should have been cancer who doesn't progress that fast or something like that, you know, magic cancer or something.

287
00:26:03,290 --> 00:26:03,650
[SPEAKER_22]: I don't know.

288
00:26:04,050 --> 00:26:07,131
[SPEAKER_04]: Try not to give away all the plot points of the movie in case some folks want to see it.

289
00:26:07,851 --> 00:26:09,111
[SPEAKER_22]: He has cancer!

290
00:26:09,671 --> 00:26:11,052
[SPEAKER_22]: Cancer!

291
00:26:11,072 --> 00:26:12,652
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, whatever.

292
00:26:14,973 --> 00:26:16,113
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, anything else you want to share?

293
00:26:19,774 --> 00:26:21,134
[SPEAKER_22]: No, really, no.

294
00:26:21,754 --> 00:26:22,054
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

295
00:26:23,134 --> 00:26:25,275
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, Angel, how was your week, how was your day?

296
00:26:27,007 --> 00:26:27,267
[SPEAKER_07]: Good.

297
00:26:28,868 --> 00:26:29,208
[SPEAKER_07]: Hang on.

298
00:26:32,029 --> 00:26:33,749
[SPEAKER_07]: Chew the salad and swallow it.

299
00:26:34,189 --> 00:26:35,069
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, I'm just kidding.

300
00:26:35,569 --> 00:26:36,730
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm very proud of Angel today.

301
00:26:37,870 --> 00:26:38,110
[SPEAKER_07]: What?

302
00:26:38,690 --> 00:26:39,491
[SPEAKER_07]: For eating a salad.

303
00:26:39,751 --> 00:26:41,231
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, yeah.

304
00:26:41,611 --> 00:26:42,271
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm very proud.

305
00:26:43,152 --> 00:26:55,335
[SPEAKER_07]: See, we may have just said that X-Fur had to do it, but he's on because I'm actually following the rules, so we'll see how far this goes.

306
00:26:57,041 --> 00:26:57,882
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been pretty good.

307
00:26:57,922 --> 00:27:07,890
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, I didn't agree to the no fast food thing, but I've only had fast food twice this week, because I realized I did have it once today and once after last week's show.

308
00:27:08,190 --> 00:27:10,512
[SPEAKER_04]: So I've been averaging only once a week, so that's not bad.

309
00:27:10,572 --> 00:27:13,475
[SPEAKER_04]: And when I go, I don't supersize anything or whatever, and I got a decent sandwich.

310
00:27:13,915 --> 00:27:15,316
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think I'm doing okay.

311
00:27:15,917 --> 00:27:19,419
[SPEAKER_04]: It's better than my usual three or four times a week, so I'm good.

312
00:27:20,220 --> 00:27:24,524
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, for me, I didn't really know where the guidelines went for me.

313
00:27:24,564 --> 00:27:29,548
[SPEAKER_07]: I just kind of grabbed the mic last week and I was like, uh, is that me not going to do it too?

314
00:27:29,608 --> 00:27:31,950
[SPEAKER_07]: And you guys just kind of gave me that look and I'm like, uh.

315
00:27:32,677 --> 00:27:34,599
[SPEAKER_24]: What was the candy that broke you?

316
00:27:52,410 --> 00:27:54,572
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, I think... Probably Candy Corn!

317
00:27:54,592 --> 00:27:55,332
[SPEAKER_07]: That stuff's evil!

318
00:27:55,652 --> 00:28:00,856
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually, no, it was like the little tiny square piece of, um, Snickers or something.

319
00:28:01,116 --> 00:28:02,537
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, one's not gonna kill ya.

320
00:28:02,677 --> 00:28:03,438
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, one's okay.

321
00:28:03,458 --> 00:28:05,799
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just that you can't have one five times a day.

322
00:28:05,819 --> 00:28:08,361
[SPEAKER_07]: And, like, a little tiny vanilla Tootsie Roll.

323
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:10,921
[SPEAKER_07]: They're so good.

324
00:28:12,482 --> 00:28:14,144
[SPEAKER_04]: Everybody was allowed to cheat on Halloween, right?

325
00:28:14,544 --> 00:28:16,506
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, but I just kind of started anyway.

326
00:28:16,546 --> 00:28:17,867
[SPEAKER_07]: I was like, eh, whatever.

327
00:28:17,887 --> 00:28:19,929
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to have to get used to it.

328
00:28:21,090 --> 00:28:21,670
[SPEAKER_07]: All is good.

329
00:28:21,911 --> 00:28:22,991
[SPEAKER_04]: When's our next weigh-in?

330
00:28:23,032 --> 00:28:24,913
[SPEAKER_04]: When are we going to do a weigh-in and check on the progress?

331
00:28:25,153 --> 00:28:25,654
[SPEAKER_04]: After the show.

332
00:28:26,014 --> 00:28:26,835
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, crap.

333
00:28:26,875 --> 00:28:28,637
[SPEAKER_04]: Wait, did I just say yay?

334
00:28:28,857 --> 00:28:30,778
[SPEAKER_07]: How about we do it in the last take?

335
00:28:31,379 --> 00:28:32,160
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, we can do that.

336
00:28:34,553 --> 00:28:40,976
[SPEAKER_07]: I have everything written down, but only you can see.

337
00:28:41,036 --> 00:28:43,758
[SPEAKER_07]: But I've got to actually make up the chart for everybody.

338
00:28:44,978 --> 00:28:45,359
[SPEAKER_07]: Sounds good.

339
00:28:46,799 --> 00:28:47,840
[SPEAKER_03]: I look forward to you later in the show.

340
00:28:48,323 --> 00:29:04,290
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, you remember that little thing I kind of announced last week, like, oh boy, let's hope I get it or whatever, and I got word back, and I opened my email on Thursday at, what time was it, probably about 6.30.

341
00:29:06,010 --> 00:29:12,213
[SPEAKER_07]: Congratulations, you're a member of the member advisory board, which is that little council I was talking about last week.

342
00:29:12,753 --> 00:29:14,854
[SPEAKER_04]: So what exactly will you be doing as part of that?

343
00:29:15,819 --> 00:29:25,337
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh, six month term working closely with staff to advise on the community and blah, you know, pretty much NDA stuff, so, cool.

344
00:29:25,637 --> 00:29:26,319
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, very cool.

345
00:29:27,831 --> 00:29:28,971
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, let's see.

346
00:29:28,991 --> 00:29:30,012
[SPEAKER_04]: My week and my day.

347
00:29:30,632 --> 00:29:32,252
[SPEAKER_04]: I just had a long week.

348
00:29:32,372 --> 00:29:34,112
[SPEAKER_04]: I did a lot, a lot of work this week.

349
00:29:34,152 --> 00:29:36,053
[SPEAKER_04]: It's been a very exhausting week, but good.

350
00:29:36,213 --> 00:29:37,033
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, in a good way.

351
00:29:37,053 --> 00:29:38,973
[SPEAKER_04]: I like my job and stuff, so it's cool.

352
00:29:40,214 --> 00:29:42,654
[SPEAKER_04]: Went out Friday night with the one and only DarkSakura.

353
00:29:42,714 --> 00:29:47,995
[SPEAKER_04]: That was pretty cool because we went out to one of the local bars and we just kind of sat around.

354
00:29:48,056 --> 00:29:49,096
[SPEAKER_04]: We chilled.

355
00:29:49,436 --> 00:29:50,096
[SPEAKER_04]: I drank a lot.

356
00:29:50,396 --> 00:29:50,876
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura.com

357
00:30:09,707 --> 00:30:10,587
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for watching!

358
00:30:27,990 --> 00:30:29,092
[SPEAKER_04]: No, he thought you were cool.

359
00:30:29,372 --> 00:30:36,222
[SPEAKER_04]: And then, you know, that night, actually, this would be Friday night, we were watching Elimidate at my friend's house.

360
00:30:36,903 --> 00:30:37,263
[SPEAKER_04]: Not Jamie.

361
00:30:37,283 --> 00:30:39,547
[SPEAKER_04]: Jamie was at home in bed by this point.

362
00:30:39,567 --> 00:30:43,572
[SPEAKER_04]: But we were watching Elimidate and on the TV came a commercial.

363
00:30:44,645 --> 00:30:53,649
[SPEAKER_04]: and it's the commercial featuring our very own Dark Sakura and Loki for the Guitar Hero story that's going to be on TV on Tuesday and it's awesome.

364
00:30:54,169 --> 00:30:58,131
[SPEAKER_04]: And it was just cool to see that during Elimidate because I know that's like one of Loki's favorite shows.

365
00:31:00,372 --> 00:31:02,413
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought Elimidate and Blind Date because they're on back to back.

366
00:31:02,493 --> 00:31:03,833
[SPEAKER_04]: I know you guys watch Blind Date.

367
00:31:04,033 --> 00:31:05,434
[SPEAKER_04]: It was on during both shows actually.

368
00:31:05,974 --> 00:31:08,295
[SPEAKER_04]: So, whatever.

369
00:31:09,156 --> 00:31:12,117
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, we actually have that story.

370
00:31:13,482 --> 00:31:16,083
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're going to, or not the story, but we have a little promo.

371
00:31:16,123 --> 00:31:19,405
[SPEAKER_04]: I just want to play it for our listeners here.

372
00:31:21,086 --> 00:31:25,829
[SPEAKER_04]: So they can hear DarkSakura's quote that will be in the news story, because it's pretty funny.

373
00:31:26,369 --> 00:31:28,550
[SPEAKER_04]: So let's see here if we can get this to play.

374
00:31:28,590 --> 00:31:31,051
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a little bit of movie time here on Orange Lounge Radio.

375
00:31:33,953 --> 00:31:34,853
[SPEAKER_03]: Loading, loading, loading.

376
00:31:34,933 --> 00:31:35,254
[SPEAKER_03]: Come on.

377
00:31:37,195 --> 00:31:37,535
[SPEAKER_03]: Here we go.

378
00:31:38,612 --> 00:31:40,433
[SPEAKER_06]: Tuesday on WB58 News at 10.

379
00:31:41,054 --> 00:31:43,256
[SPEAKER_07]: It feels like playing an actual guitar.

380
00:31:43,476 --> 00:31:46,558
[SPEAKER_06]: Get the rush of rocking out for an audience right in your own living room.

381
00:31:46,578 --> 00:31:48,920
[SPEAKER_07]: I love the remote, so I play that when it beats the dated.

382
00:31:49,180 --> 00:31:52,023
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a fun new way to make your musical dreams a reality.

383
00:31:52,223 --> 00:31:54,965
[SPEAKER_06]: You're actually creating music and playing in front of a crowd.

384
00:31:55,125 --> 00:31:58,628
[SPEAKER_06]: Find out why this rocking new game could be a big hit this holiday season.

385
00:31:58,948 --> 00:32:01,190
[SPEAKER_06]: People of all ages are really getting into this.

386
00:32:01,410 --> 00:32:02,411
[SPEAKER_06]: Tuesday on WB58 News at 10.

387
00:32:05,566 --> 00:32:14,428
[SPEAKER_04]: I love how in that promo there's like one shot of Loki for like two, not even a second.

388
00:32:14,468 --> 00:32:17,969
[SPEAKER_04]: There's just like a shot of Loki going on the guitar and that's it.

389
00:32:18,329 --> 00:32:21,550
[SPEAKER_04]: It was the equivalent of Loki's foot basically being in the new story.

390
00:32:22,330 --> 00:32:22,850
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's great.

391
00:32:22,910 --> 00:32:23,630
[SPEAKER_04]: And what else is new?

392
00:32:23,650 --> 00:32:25,711
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess the distance had the neat thing where I nodded my head.

393
00:32:26,911 --> 00:32:30,512
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think that's cool that DarkSakura is talking about the Ramones.

394
00:32:30,772 --> 00:32:33,493
[SPEAKER_04]: That kind of amused me when I saw that on TV.

395
00:32:34,473 --> 00:32:34,613
[SPEAKER_04]: So...

396
00:32:36,007 --> 00:32:37,748
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, we posted a link to that on the website.

397
00:32:37,768 --> 00:32:42,011
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course, Tuesday night is when the story is going to air, and we will hopefully have something.

398
00:32:42,491 --> 00:32:51,576
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm thinking the news stations, because it looks like they put a lot of their news stories on the website, so I'm thinking the news station might actually put it on their website, which would certainly make it easier for us to share it with all of you.

399
00:32:51,716 --> 00:32:56,659
[SPEAKER_04]: Because if they put the promo up there, they'll put the story up there, and then hopefully we'll have so much fun.

400
00:32:57,479 --> 00:32:56,659
2.0.

401
00:32:58,160 --> 00:32:58,720
[SPEAKER_04]: So excited.

402
00:32:59,341 --> 00:32:59,681
[SPEAKER_22]: I hope.

403
00:32:59,701 --> 00:33:03,283
[SPEAKER_22]: You know, I'm guessing they're not even going to let me say anything.

404
00:33:03,463 --> 00:33:05,284
[SPEAKER_22]: I'll just be the guy in the background.

405
00:33:06,633 --> 00:33:08,134
[SPEAKER_22]: So what do you think about this game?

406
00:33:08,554 --> 00:33:09,594
[SPEAKER_22]: And then it'll just cut away.

407
00:33:10,054 --> 00:33:19,518
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what's great is my ignition pad is over there, and it's in the background of one of the shots, so my ignition pad got more screen time than yours did.

408
00:33:19,638 --> 00:33:23,940
[SPEAKER_07]: My Konami guitars are out, because we've been playing guitar for years before.

409
00:33:24,980 --> 00:33:25,321
[SPEAKER_04]: Right on.

410
00:33:25,421 --> 00:33:26,501
[SPEAKER_07]: And the Gemania set was out.

411
00:33:27,982 --> 00:33:28,262
[SPEAKER_04]: Awesome.

412
00:33:29,901 --> 00:33:35,889
[SPEAKER_04]: So, anyway, let's talk about Guitar Hero a little bit, because I finally managed to pick up the game this week.

413
00:33:36,149 --> 00:33:40,254
[SPEAKER_04]: I picked up Guitar Hero, and I've been playing the shit out of it since yesterday when I got it.

414
00:33:40,835 --> 00:33:40,955
[SPEAKER_04]: It's...

415
00:33:41,781 --> 00:33:42,582
[SPEAKER_04]: Really great.

416
00:33:42,762 --> 00:33:48,947
[SPEAKER_04]: I was really surprised considering that the last game Red Octane put out I wasn't too impressed with.

417
00:33:49,327 --> 00:33:57,254
[SPEAKER_04]: This one, being done by Harmonix, is so wonderful and it really makes me hopeful for whatever Red Octane is going to do in the future.

418
00:33:57,314 --> 00:34:00,096
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe going to some other types of music.

419
00:34:00,156 --> 00:34:03,919
[SPEAKER_04]: I think the music game community is going to win big if this game does well.

420
00:34:03,959 --> 00:34:05,840
[SPEAKER_04]: And a lot of early reviews for this game...

421
00:34:06,721 --> 00:34:08,203
[SPEAKER_04]: have great scores.

422
00:34:08,324 --> 00:34:10,026
[SPEAKER_04]: I think GameSpot gave it a great review.

423
00:34:10,066 --> 00:34:13,391
[SPEAKER_04]: I know 1up.com gave it a perfect 10.

424
00:34:14,052 --> 00:34:15,874
[SPEAKER_04]: That's higher than a lot of DDR games get.

425
00:34:16,155 --> 00:34:20,661
[SPEAKER_04]: I think what people are really liking about the game is that it's very accessible.

426
00:34:20,841 --> 00:34:22,364
[SPEAKER_04]: It is.

427
00:34:22,604 --> 00:34:23,185
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a fun game.

428
00:34:23,365 --> 00:34:29,728
[SPEAKER_07]: My friend came over yesterday for Stargate Marathon, and I was playing a game while she was making pancakes.

429
00:34:30,788 --> 00:34:31,488
[SPEAKER_07]: Awesome.

430
00:34:31,948 --> 00:34:32,989
[SPEAKER_07]: Holy pancakes, they were yummy.

431
00:34:33,869 --> 00:34:38,371
[SPEAKER_07]: And I was playing just a couple of stuff, and she was like, oh my god, they got their original songs.

432
00:34:38,391 --> 00:34:39,091
[SPEAKER_07]: I was like, no.

433
00:34:39,771 --> 00:34:42,633
[SPEAKER_04]: No, the cover songs were that good, but the covers were really good.

434
00:34:43,313 --> 00:34:46,154
[SPEAKER_07]: They went to a great length to duplicate the effects.

435
00:34:46,434 --> 00:34:46,974
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, they did.

436
00:34:47,054 --> 00:34:53,416
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, some of them, like the Franz Ferdinand song that I kind of like, it's in their sounds, just like the original.

437
00:34:53,516 --> 00:34:55,316
[SPEAKER_04]: And, like, Iron Man sounds great.

438
00:34:55,837 --> 00:34:57,917
[SPEAKER_04]: Some of them aren't exact, but they're close enough.

439
00:34:57,937 --> 00:35:00,098
[SPEAKER_04]: They're closer than any karaoke revolution, I think it's been.

440
00:35:00,118 --> 00:35:01,378
[SPEAKER_07]: I was freaking playing Thundercats 65.

441
00:35:01,638 --> 00:35:02,158
[SPEAKER_07]: That was cool.

442
00:35:02,278 --> 00:35:03,019
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's awesome.

443
00:35:03,459 --> 00:35:04,259
[SPEAKER_04]: It's got a great song.

444
00:35:04,319 --> 00:35:11,601
[SPEAKER_04]: My only kind of boo-hoo part is that there's not more songs playable at the very start, because yesterday, you know, I had some people over.

445
00:35:11,641 --> 00:35:14,542
[SPEAKER_04]: We were wanting to play Guitar Freaks, or Guitar Freaks, Guitar Hero.

446
00:35:14,622 --> 00:35:14,862
[SPEAKER_04]: Whoops.

447
00:35:15,922 --> 00:35:17,443
[SPEAKER_04]: Where's Freebird?

448
00:35:38,966 --> 00:35:40,446
[SPEAKER_04]: The thing said no Freebird!

449
00:35:40,546 --> 00:35:41,487
[SPEAKER_04]: I want Freebird!

450
00:35:41,587 --> 00:35:43,267
[SPEAKER_04]: They need to have Freebird in the sequel.

451
00:35:43,307 --> 00:35:45,048
[SPEAKER_04]: No Freebird and no Stairway to Heaven!

452
00:35:45,068 --> 00:35:49,949
[SPEAKER_04]: They need Freebird, and they need Stairway, and they need... Blur.

453
00:35:51,089 --> 00:35:53,830
[SPEAKER_04]: I was gonna say Sweet Home Alabama, but I guess we already have... Blur.

454
00:35:54,810 --> 00:35:55,650
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure, we can have Blur.

455
00:35:55,970 --> 00:35:56,531
[SPEAKER_04]: Metallica?

456
00:35:57,551 --> 00:35:59,511
[SPEAKER_04]: Like old Metallica, not new sellout Metallica?

457
00:35:59,531 --> 00:36:01,792
[SPEAKER_07]: Metallica...

458
00:36:03,208 --> 00:36:10,931
[SPEAKER_22]: I want to get some really hard rock stuff in here, like, you know, I'm going to get some metal, like, even get some filter in there, you know, some of that stuff.

459
00:36:11,931 --> 00:36:21,315
[SPEAKER_22]: Even, you know, even though they've kind of dissolved as a band, Gravity Kills would be fucking awesome, because they just had really good guitar sections in the whole stuff.

460
00:36:21,435 --> 00:36:22,615
[SPEAKER_22]: Same, that and Rammstein.

461
00:36:22,655 --> 00:36:25,896
[SPEAKER_22]: Rammstein had tons of really good guitar sections in their songs.

462
00:36:26,076 --> 00:36:27,717
[SPEAKER_04]: We need Guns N' Roses.

463
00:36:28,137 --> 00:36:28,417
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

464
00:36:28,457 --> 00:36:28,657
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

465
00:36:28,737 --> 00:36:30,738
[SPEAKER_07]: We need, no, we need Welcome to the Jungle, I'm sorry.

466
00:36:30,758 --> 00:36:30,958
[SPEAKER_07]: Welcome!

467
00:36:34,034 --> 00:37:01,525
[SPEAKER_04]: I hope they link up to a later game I hope they decide to do a drum game I mean I guess that would be too similar but maybe hook up well I guess they can't even hook up to Karaoke Revolution because it's another company but somehow hook up to another you know what Red Octane should revive is keyboard games they should launch a keyboard game that would be badass expensive but fun Van Halen would be awesome too

468
00:37:02,703 --> 00:37:07,829
[SPEAKER_04]: DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

469
00:37:17,958 --> 00:37:23,242
[SPEAKER_04]: What else I wanted to say about Guitar Hero though, you know my favorite thing about Guitar Hero is the art direction.

470
00:37:23,982 --> 00:37:33,809
[SPEAKER_04]: The art and like the sets and the little like, just there's little jokes that make the cold game, like when you're loading and going to a new stage it shows it turning up to 11.

471
00:37:34,809 --> 00:37:40,073
[SPEAKER_07]: The female guitarist with the short black and red hair was actually modeled off of a real person.

472
00:37:40,521 --> 00:37:40,821
[SPEAKER_03]: Really?

473
00:37:40,941 --> 00:37:42,882
[SPEAKER_03]: Aren't they all supposed to be modeled off real people?

474
00:37:42,902 --> 00:37:49,185
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I know there's like the Keith Richards clone that I just sort of freaked out over because the first time I saw him pop up was with a flying V. I was like, it's Murdoch!

475
00:37:49,465 --> 00:37:49,706
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

476
00:37:50,146 --> 00:37:50,706
[SPEAKER_24]: Nerd moment!

477
00:37:52,547 --> 00:38:01,051
[SPEAKER_04]: And, yeah, I just, the art direction in the game isn't, like the little pictures drawn on the notebook, like they even have a unicorn drawn on the notebook, which made me think of, anyway, I forget it.

478
00:38:03,332 --> 00:38:04,613
[SPEAKER_04]: But the art direction in the game is great.

479
00:38:04,653 --> 00:38:08,435
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's just all these, I like the way it's set up.

480
00:38:10,034 --> 00:38:12,056
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, it's different than a Bomani game.

481
00:38:12,097 --> 00:38:13,118
[SPEAKER_04]: It does make me motion sick.

482
00:38:13,859 --> 00:38:14,179
[SPEAKER_04]: Really?

483
00:38:14,279 --> 00:38:14,599
[SPEAKER_04]: Why is that?

484
00:38:14,620 --> 00:38:15,961
[SPEAKER_04]: Just the ISO perspective thing?

485
00:38:16,081 --> 00:38:16,442
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

486
00:38:16,542 --> 00:38:17,483
[SPEAKER_04]: And the way it's moving?

487
00:38:17,603 --> 00:38:18,144
[SPEAKER_04]: That's too bad.

488
00:38:19,790 --> 00:38:20,390
[SPEAKER_04]: Music is not MIDI!

489
00:38:43,545 --> 00:38:44,746
[SPEAKER_04]: Mass Riot Breaks Out

490
00:39:02,478 --> 00:39:25,136
[SPEAKER_04]: and then it shows the bill with your managers cut and the food cut and the bribery cuts and all that stuff leaving you with so much money like all that little stuff goes a long way in amusing me greatly and that's important to amuse me greatly so the way the game is presented it's not the same even as like amplitude and frequency because amplitude and frequency is almost walk up, play your songs, walk away the way the Guitar Hero is set up is cool and is what

491
00:39:25,396 --> 00:39:30,219
[SPEAKER_04]: Part of what makes that game so great and stand out so much differently than Guitar Freaks.

492
00:39:30,600 --> 00:39:34,762
[SPEAKER_04]: Honestly, Guitar Heroes and Guitar Freaks are very different games.

493
00:39:35,223 --> 00:39:41,087
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, they both use guitar controllers, but you've got Guitar Hero has five buttons, which changes things completely.

494
00:39:41,287 --> 00:39:42,247
[SPEAKER_04]: And the whammy bar!

495
00:39:42,528 --> 00:39:43,388
[SPEAKER_04]: And the whammy bar!

496
00:39:43,768 --> 00:39:44,429
[SPEAKER_04]: Absolutely.

497
00:39:44,469 --> 00:39:45,810
[SPEAKER_04]: I was wailing hard, okay?

498
00:39:46,110 --> 00:39:53,215
[SPEAKER_04]: The way you turn your guitar up, the wailing thing, like in Guitar Freaks it was called a wailing bonus, it's done...

499
00:39:54,258 --> 00:39:56,639
[SPEAKER_04]: One thing I do sort of miss though that was in Guitar Freaks were the hidden notes.

500
00:40:14,427 --> 00:40:20,118
[SPEAKER_07]: Where if you, you know, manage to find the hidden notes, it would just pop up a whole new set of notes.

501
00:40:20,479 --> 00:40:21,241
[SPEAKER_04]: Or the open picks.

502
00:40:21,601 --> 00:40:21,822
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

503
00:40:22,403 --> 00:40:25,449
[SPEAKER_04]: But still, I mean, Guitar Hero has... She gets freestyle points.

504
00:40:26,567 --> 00:40:28,708
[SPEAKER_04]: I got mine right when the shipment arrived at our GameStop.

505
00:40:28,728 --> 00:40:28,848
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.

506
00:40:28,868 --> 00:40:28,948
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki?

507
00:40:54,204 --> 00:41:06,017
[SPEAKER_07]: I was going to mention that the game's not even supposed to be out yet, but... Technically, but... Actually, I'm going to go ahead and say officially it had no street date on any of their shipped packages, therefore it could be released ASAP.

508
00:41:06,037 --> 00:41:14,706
[SPEAKER_22]: Well, yeah, I mean, games don't really have street dates, but the whole thing was they were not supposed to be shipping until Tuesday anyway, so a lot of this stuff's early.

509
00:41:15,325 --> 00:41:18,189
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it was kind of one of those things, like, they did it in the groove the very same way.

510
00:41:18,230 --> 00:41:19,792
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, it didn't really have an official release date.

511
00:41:19,832 --> 00:41:22,256
[SPEAKER_04]: It was just, you know, we're going to ship it out whenever you get it.

512
00:41:22,376 --> 00:41:24,820
[SPEAKER_22]: We got it pressed faster than we thought we would, so here you go.

513
00:41:25,498 --> 00:41:26,439
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, so that's cool.

514
00:41:26,619 --> 00:41:28,821
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, so it's out there now if you guys want to look around.

515
00:41:28,861 --> 00:41:33,625
[SPEAKER_04]: But probably Tuesday, Wednesday is when you're really going to start seeing this game out there just about everywhere.

516
00:41:33,925 --> 00:41:35,306
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think it has the potential to do very well.

517
00:41:35,346 --> 00:41:36,407
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought it was interesting.

518
00:41:36,767 --> 00:41:40,390
[SPEAKER_04]: And I remember bringing this up on the show before about the MTV partnership with the game.

519
00:41:40,751 --> 00:41:44,574
[SPEAKER_04]: But I kind of forgot about it until I booted up the game and saw the MTV logo.

520
00:41:44,974 --> 00:41:49,358
[SPEAKER_04]: And even though MTV kind of sucks, I think the partnership is going to be great exposure for the game.

521
00:41:49,898 --> 00:42:03,704
[SPEAKER_04]: and what's really cool about the game is that all the unlocked songs are unsigned bands with a real song, like the people that won the Be a Guitar Hero contest and you know, littler bands, I guess I shouldn't say unsigned, but more littler, not so heard of bands.

522
00:42:03,724 --> 00:42:10,707
[SPEAKER_04]: The only band in there I'd really heard of before was Freeze Pop, because they have a song there that you unlock and it's badass.

523
00:42:10,867 --> 00:42:12,268
[SPEAKER_04]: I love the Freeze Pop song.

524
00:42:12,628 --> 00:42:13,368
[SPEAKER_04]: Get ready to rock.

525
00:42:14,109 --> 00:42:14,629
[SPEAKER_04]: It's great.

526
00:42:16,280 --> 00:42:19,563
[SPEAKER_04]: So anyway, I definitely give a glowing review to Guitar Hero.

527
00:42:19,583 --> 00:42:22,385
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's fabulous, and you all should go buy it if you want to play a guitar game.

528
00:42:22,646 --> 00:42:27,770
[SPEAKER_04]: The price tag's a little bit high, so maybe they'll come down in price after Christmas, and maybe it would be a better time to get it.

529
00:42:28,130 --> 00:42:29,231
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's great.

530
00:42:29,372 --> 00:42:30,833
[SPEAKER_04]: It's so much fun.

531
00:42:33,535 --> 00:42:34,576
[SPEAKER_04]: Any other thoughts on Guitar Hero?

532
00:42:36,037 --> 00:42:37,158
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll talk a little... Oh, Angel.

533
00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:42,103
[SPEAKER_07]: I like how the notes at the bottom of the screen, like the colors...

534
00:42:43,385 --> 00:42:53,509
[SPEAKER_07]: For the notes, because it obviously goes with the buttons, but, you know, they're bright on the screen, so for me, it'll be easier to play, since I am color and shape oriented.

535
00:42:54,430 --> 00:43:06,895
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, you guys knew that, but, um, yeah, so, it'll be easier for me to play, and for those that have difficulty like I do, well, it'll be a good thing, so I can't wait to pick it up!

536
00:43:07,255 --> 00:43:07,355
[SPEAKER_07]: Ah!

537
00:43:09,537 --> 00:43:10,378
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, sounds good.

538
00:43:10,638 --> 00:43:13,480
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's very bright and all the colors stand out.

539
00:43:13,540 --> 00:43:14,180
[SPEAKER_04]: It's very nice.

540
00:43:15,081 --> 00:43:15,461
[SPEAKER_04]: Very nice.

541
00:43:16,562 --> 00:43:21,645
[SPEAKER_04]: Basically, the way it's set up, just imagine it's frequency or amplitude, except you don't move around the tube.

542
00:43:21,685 --> 00:43:23,927
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just the ISO view of the notes coming at you.

543
00:43:24,607 --> 00:43:28,770
[SPEAKER_04]: Which sometimes can be a little bit bothersome, though, because you can't see the notes as far in advance.

544
00:43:28,850 --> 00:43:31,832
[SPEAKER_04]: And for me, I'm really big on noticing the measures.

545
00:43:31,912 --> 00:43:34,394
[SPEAKER_04]: Like in Guitar Freaks, you can see the little lines that show you the measures.

546
00:43:34,714 --> 00:43:39,237
[SPEAKER_04]: But in Guitar Hero, it's harder to see those lines and judge because it's at an ISO perspective.

547
00:43:39,637 --> 00:43:41,438
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's kind of, I don't know, it's kind of tricky.

548
00:43:41,678 --> 00:43:43,479
[SPEAKER_04]: But those are really minor, minor complaints.

549
00:43:43,779 --> 00:43:49,963
[SPEAKER_04]: I would hope that in a later version you could maybe change that, like tilt the perspective to something that works better for me.

550
00:43:50,003 --> 00:43:52,385
[SPEAKER_04]: Like that would be great if you could freely rotate the perspective.

551
00:43:52,405 --> 00:43:53,185
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sure it's possible.

552
00:43:53,945 --> 00:43:56,507
[SPEAKER_04]: But that's a very minor complaint in the scope of things, honestly.

553
00:43:56,607 --> 00:43:57,828
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a great first release.

554
00:43:58,188 --> 00:43:59,389
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of promising things.

555
00:43:59,569 --> 00:44:00,589
[SPEAKER_04]: Kick-ass song list.

556
00:44:02,010 --> 00:44:02,370
[SPEAKER_04]: I love it.

557
00:44:02,711 --> 00:44:03,031
[SPEAKER_04]: It's great.

558
00:44:04,724 --> 00:44:04,784
[SPEAKER_04]: D.R.

559
00:44:04,804 --> 00:44:05,845
[SPEAKER_04]: Mario Mix Guitar Hero

560
00:44:24,562 --> 00:44:28,804
[SPEAKER_04]: I think I'm playing Smoke on the Water My hand was about to fall off This song's long, it's like 7 minutes

561
00:44:52,523 --> 00:44:56,810
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, we'll be back after this with more Orange Lounge Radio.

562
00:44:56,890 --> 00:45:01,717
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess we'll start off this break with a little bit of, we'll start off with a classic Guitar Freaks tune.

563
00:45:01,998 --> 00:45:03,981
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll be back after this with more Orange Lounge Radio.

564
00:47:47,740 --> 00:47:48,701
[SPEAKER_15]: It's great, man!

565
00:50:14,213 --> 00:50:15,094
Thank you for watching!

566
00:51:37,458 --> 00:51:38,699
[SPEAKER_28]: Orange Lounge Radio.

567
00:51:39,019 --> 00:51:41,180
[SPEAKER_04]: We put your thing down, flip it, and reverse it.

568
00:51:51,735 --> 00:51:54,337
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm trekking on along here after that Guitar Freaks break.

569
00:51:54,417 --> 00:52:02,524
[SPEAKER_04]: We were checking out during the break some folks in our chat room posted that some websites out there have leaked some new Beatmania screenshots.

570
00:52:03,785 --> 00:52:06,607
[SPEAKER_04]: Screens from the brand new Beatmania game and I totally missed this.

571
00:52:06,647 --> 00:52:08,609
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess these were actually released earlier in the week.

572
00:52:09,370 --> 00:52:11,271
[SPEAKER_04]: But very interesting, some of these screenshots.

573
00:52:11,932 --> 00:52:17,697
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe I missed this before if this was previously announced, but I noticed one of these screens shows the free scratching zone.

574
00:52:18,297 --> 00:52:21,098
[SPEAKER_04]: DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

575
00:52:40,226 --> 00:52:41,727
[SPEAKER_04]: How often do they use them in songs?

576
00:52:41,747 --> 00:52:42,227
[SPEAKER_04]: Not very.

577
00:52:42,507 --> 00:52:50,211
[SPEAKER_04]: I swear, the five key game I probably played the most of was Beatmania 6 mix and core, that release, and I don't remember seeing this in there.

578
00:52:50,731 --> 00:52:53,292
[SPEAKER_04]: There was like a couple songs, a handful.

579
00:52:53,552 --> 00:52:54,693
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe that was just on crack, I don't know.

580
00:52:56,333 --> 00:53:04,897
[SPEAKER_04]: Very interesting purpley interface there, and also, by the way, which shows that V is in the game, but that shouldn't be a big shock to anybody, that V is going to turn up in Beatmania USA.

581
00:53:04,917 --> 00:53:05,157
[SPEAKER_00]: Why not?

582
00:53:05,217 --> 00:53:08,399
[SPEAKER_04]: It's been like every other... Every Japanese release since 5th.

583
00:53:09,594 --> 00:53:10,134
[SPEAKER_04]: Every single one.

584
00:53:10,154 --> 00:53:12,615
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you know that TenStyle is only like a few days away?

585
00:53:13,515 --> 00:53:14,015
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not that far.

586
00:53:14,055 --> 00:53:16,195
[SPEAKER_04]: I think TenStyle is like 10 days away, somebody was telling me.

587
00:53:16,855 --> 00:53:17,255
[SPEAKER_04]: Crazy.

588
00:53:19,156 --> 00:53:20,536
[SPEAKER_04]: So BeatMini is very purple.

589
00:53:20,596 --> 00:53:21,776
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a very different interface.

590
00:53:22,216 --> 00:53:29,938
[SPEAKER_04]: I can appreciate that they're doing something new with it, not just, you know, cloning a Japanese release and taking out some songs and putting in different ones.

591
00:53:30,038 --> 00:53:37,459
[SPEAKER_04]: It makes the game feel very much like ours, even if you don't care for purple or don't really care for the interface, at least it's something a little different.

592
00:53:37,799 --> 00:53:38,139
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, L.O.G.? ?

593
00:53:40,208 --> 00:53:43,670
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for watching!

594
00:53:57,881 --> 00:54:05,604
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, I think what we'll do now before we get to list list because I don't think everyone's quite ready to go yet.

595
00:54:06,144 --> 00:54:21,209
[SPEAKER_04]: I think what maybe we'll do is we'll go to the Skype line and take some telephone calls on the Skype line, www.orangeloungeradio.com and click on interact with us if you would like to get more information about how you can call the program.

596
00:54:22,189 --> 00:54:32,304
[SPEAKER_04]: You can either use your computer using a program called Skype, or you can actually use our brand new phone number, which I don't remember off the top of my head, but it's posted on the website.

597
00:54:32,905 --> 00:54:34,007
[SPEAKER_04]: But the phone's already ringing.

598
00:54:34,047 --> 00:54:35,128
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't need to give out that phone number.

599
00:54:35,148 --> 00:54:36,190
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to go right to a call.

600
00:54:36,250 --> 00:54:37,932
[SPEAKER_04]: So, hello, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

601
00:54:39,776 --> 00:54:40,677
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey Siggy, how you doing?

602
00:54:41,698 --> 00:54:43,840
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm a little bit anticipated right now.

603
00:54:44,180 --> 00:54:44,480
[SPEAKER_04]: You're what?

604
00:54:44,540 --> 00:54:46,823
[SPEAKER_04]: A little bit anticipated.

605
00:54:47,343 --> 00:54:48,084
[SPEAKER_04]: Anticipated?

606
00:54:48,124 --> 00:54:48,544
[SPEAKER_04]: Why's that?

607
00:54:49,065 --> 00:54:50,967
[SPEAKER_30]: Because 10 days left.

608
00:54:51,167 --> 00:54:53,189
[SPEAKER_30]: Beatmania 2DX, TenStyle, CS.

609
00:54:53,669 --> 00:54:54,130
[SPEAKER_04]: That's right.

610
00:54:54,170 --> 00:54:58,494
[SPEAKER_04]: You were telling me about this before the show, that we don't have much longer to go before TenStyle's going to be out.

611
00:54:58,514 --> 00:54:59,015
[SPEAKER_04]: That's awesome.

612
00:54:59,895 --> 00:55:04,319
[SPEAKER_30]: Yeah, well, I got a little news about Ten Style CS for those who haven't caught up with it yet.

613
00:55:04,940 --> 00:55:05,260
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah?

614
00:55:05,300 --> 00:55:05,680
[SPEAKER_04]: What's that?

615
00:55:06,161 --> 00:55:09,784
[SPEAKER_30]: Two Happy Sky songs have been confirmed for Ten Style CS.

616
00:55:10,885 --> 00:55:11,325
[SPEAKER_04]: What's that?

617
00:55:11,986 --> 00:55:14,228
[SPEAKER_30]: That's Lesson 5 and Under the Sky.

618
00:55:15,209 --> 00:55:15,649
[SPEAKER_04]: Awesome.

619
00:55:15,789 --> 00:55:20,311
[SPEAKER_04]: So we don't just get one, we get two Happy Sky songs.

620
00:55:20,411 --> 00:55:21,011
[SPEAKER_04]: That's good news.

621
00:55:21,772 --> 00:55:25,013
[SPEAKER_30]: So far, there have been 24 unconfirmed songs yet.

622
00:55:25,974 --> 00:55:26,354
[SPEAKER_30]: Really?

623
00:55:27,154 --> 00:55:33,917
[SPEAKER_30]: Probably until this Thursday, we won't be seeing, you know, Konami's going to reveal the entire complete song list.

624
00:55:34,097 --> 00:55:35,217
[SPEAKER_30]: Hopefully by this Thursday.

625
00:55:36,058 --> 00:55:38,058
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah, seeing as the games come out very soon.

626
00:55:38,739 --> 00:55:40,960
[SPEAKER_22]: All those songs, of course, being done by LED.

627
00:55:44,063 --> 00:55:51,366
[SPEAKER_30]: It's all V. It's all remixes of V. Speaking of V, yeah, V has been confirmed for Beatmania US.

628
00:55:51,727 --> 00:55:53,367
[SPEAKER_04]: Not a big surprise, though, honestly.

629
00:55:53,507 --> 00:55:55,288
[SPEAKER_30]: Nah, not a big surprise to me either.

630
00:55:55,989 --> 00:55:59,990
[SPEAKER_04]: So, in fact, if V hadn't have been there, you know people would have complained.

631
00:56:00,030 --> 00:56:00,911
[SPEAKER_13]: Where's V?

632
00:56:01,331 --> 00:56:02,772
[SPEAKER_13]: Why didn't they put V in there?

633
00:56:03,212 --> 00:56:04,492
[SPEAKER_13]: Konami hates us.

634
00:56:04,552 --> 00:56:06,033
[SPEAKER_13]: Konami hates America.

635
00:56:06,373 --> 00:56:07,854
[SPEAKER_13]: Konami USA sucks.

636
00:56:07,894 --> 00:56:09,615
[SPEAKER_13]: Why didn't they put my fucking V in there?

637
00:56:12,233 --> 00:56:13,494
[SPEAKER_04]: You know that's how it would have been.

638
00:56:14,114 --> 00:56:15,635
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

639
00:56:16,495 --> 00:56:23,639
[SPEAKER_30]: Talking about other stuff, well, you haven't premiered the Matsumoto Goliath's bonus track yet, right?

640
00:56:23,699 --> 00:56:27,921
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I keep meaning to, and I always forget to play it, but it's a great song.

641
00:56:27,961 --> 00:56:28,682
[SPEAKER_04]: I love the video.

642
00:56:28,842 --> 00:56:29,582
[SPEAKER_04]: The video's very cool.

643
00:56:29,602 --> 00:56:32,704
[SPEAKER_30]: I really love the video, too, and I'm hoping that this song is going to be on the 10,000.

644
00:56:33,144 --> 00:56:34,885
[SPEAKER_30]: Yes, it's a bonus song.

645
00:56:35,525 --> 00:56:35,945
[SPEAKER_03]: It might.

646
00:56:36,185 --> 00:56:36,746
[SPEAKER_03]: That would be cool.

647
00:56:38,026 --> 00:56:39,727
[SPEAKER_30]: Yeah, so should I reveal it now?

648
00:56:40,307 --> 00:56:40,648
[SPEAKER_30]: Sure, do it.

649
00:56:41,590 --> 00:56:45,252
[SPEAKER_30]: Okay, here's from the Goliath's bonus track.

650
00:56:46,032 --> 00:56:47,993
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's Terra with Alphyshear.

651
00:56:48,153 --> 00:56:49,674
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I thought you were just going to name it.

652
00:56:49,734 --> 00:56:50,014
[SPEAKER_04]: Hold on.

653
00:56:50,034 --> 00:56:51,174
[SPEAKER_04]: I've got to actually play it?

654
00:56:51,234 --> 00:56:51,514
[SPEAKER_04]: Hold on.

655
00:56:52,675 --> 00:56:53,375
[SPEAKER_30]: Sorry about that.

656
00:56:54,216 --> 00:56:54,616
[SPEAKER_04]: That's all right.

657
00:56:54,636 --> 00:56:54,856
[SPEAKER_04]: Hold on.

658
00:56:55,096 --> 00:56:55,516
[SPEAKER_04]: We can play it.

659
00:56:55,536 --> 00:56:57,117
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll play... How long is it?

660
00:56:57,157 --> 00:56:58,037
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't remember how long it is.

661
00:56:58,057 --> 00:56:59,798
[SPEAKER_30]: It's about 2 minutes 45 seconds.

662
00:56:59,838 --> 00:57:00,498
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, that's not that long.

663
00:57:00,538 --> 00:57:01,319
[SPEAKER_04]: We can go ahead and play that.

664
00:57:01,539 --> 00:57:02,359
[SPEAKER_04]: I've got to get it, though.

665
00:57:02,399 --> 00:57:02,719
[SPEAKER_04]: Here we go.

666
00:57:03,300 --> 00:57:03,940
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, so here it is.

667
00:57:04,160 --> 00:57:05,420
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, from the top.

668
00:57:05,461 --> 00:57:06,081
[SPEAKER_04]: Introduce it again.

669
00:57:07,519 --> 00:57:11,603
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's the Goliath bonus track and tarot with Alpharshir.

670
00:57:11,963 --> 00:57:14,085
[SPEAKER_04]: And for those in studio, you can see the video if you want.

671
00:57:14,105 --> 00:57:14,585
[SPEAKER_04]: It's pretty cool.

672
00:57:36,366 --> 00:57:38,368
Thank you for watching!

673
00:58:02,715 --> 00:58:03,777
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you for watching!

674
00:58:39,256 --> 00:58:43,418
I've been collecting the fragments of you that have changed into eternity

675
00:59:20,159 --> 00:59:21,660
Thank you for watching!

676
00:59:48,208 --> 00:59:50,450
[SPEAKER_04]: Now that song is pretty badass, I gotta say.

677
00:59:50,710 --> 00:59:55,093
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a really good song, and I do hope that song does turn up in Ten Styles, one of the hidden tracks, because it's great.

678
00:59:55,113 --> 00:59:56,074
[SPEAKER_04]: And the video's great, too.

679
00:59:56,394 --> 01:00:00,117
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, you know, we're kind of sitting here in the studio watching it, and I'm hearing, ooh, I need an LJ Akana that.

680
01:00:00,518 --> 01:00:01,919
[SPEAKER_04]: Ooh, I need to cosplay that.

681
01:00:01,999 --> 01:00:02,599
[SPEAKER_04]: I need to do this.

682
01:00:02,679 --> 01:00:02,939
[SPEAKER_04]: I need to...

683
01:00:04,040 --> 01:00:05,442
[SPEAKER_04]: It's got a nice video, I like the setup.

684
01:00:05,682 --> 01:00:12,070
[SPEAKER_04]: For those who weren't able to see the video, it basically is, um, it's kind of like this epic battle with all the 2DX characters.

685
01:00:12,230 --> 01:00:12,931
[SPEAKER_04]: That's kind of what it is.

686
01:00:13,311 --> 01:00:13,892
[SPEAKER_04]: It looks like.

687
01:00:13,932 --> 01:00:14,092
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

688
01:00:14,693 --> 01:00:16,595
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like, you know, it's like a bit from Eden.

689
01:00:17,316 --> 01:00:17,757
[SPEAKER_30]: Yeah.

690
01:00:18,778 --> 01:00:20,780
[SPEAKER_30]: Um, some expressions like...

691
01:00:21,941 --> 01:00:25,824
[SPEAKER_30]: Thank you for reminding us to check that out, because it's a pretty cool one, so thank you.

692
01:00:25,844 --> 01:00:26,164
[SPEAKER_30]: No problem.

693
01:00:52,509 --> 01:00:54,431
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, well, anything else you want to share with our listeners?

694
01:00:55,011 --> 01:00:56,273
[SPEAKER_30]: Well, nothing much else.

695
01:00:56,313 --> 01:01:00,276
[SPEAKER_30]: Hopefully, when I get my copy of Tenstar, I will give you the details.

696
01:01:00,797 --> 01:01:01,518
[SPEAKER_28]: Alright, sounds good.

697
01:01:01,538 --> 01:01:02,498
[SPEAKER_28]: We'll be looking forward to hearing it.

698
01:01:03,199 --> 01:01:03,419
[SPEAKER_30]: Yeah.

699
01:01:03,700 --> 01:01:04,841
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, take care, buddy.

700
01:01:04,861 --> 01:01:05,241
[SPEAKER_04]: Have a good one.

701
01:01:05,882 --> 01:01:06,142
[SPEAKER_04]: Later.

702
01:01:06,282 --> 01:01:06,482
[SPEAKER_04]: Later.

703
01:01:09,845 --> 01:01:15,451
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, we're going to go to another call now here on the Skype line, and we'll see what this person wants.

704
01:01:15,511 --> 01:01:16,572
[SPEAKER_04]: Hello, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

705
01:01:19,874 --> 01:01:20,354
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, we're here.

706
01:01:20,474 --> 01:01:21,415
[SPEAKER_03]: Can you hear me?

707
01:01:21,515 --> 01:01:22,335
[SPEAKER_03]: We can kind of hear you.

708
01:01:22,355 --> 01:01:22,676
[SPEAKER_03]: What's up?

709
01:01:24,137 --> 01:01:25,097
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, not much.

710
01:01:25,417 --> 01:01:26,158
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm eating Doritos.

711
01:01:26,758 --> 01:01:28,499
[SPEAKER_27]: You're eating Doritos again, huh?

712
01:01:28,539 --> 01:01:29,120
[SPEAKER_27]: How you doing?

713
01:01:30,321 --> 01:01:32,122
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, we got nacho this time.

714
01:01:33,043 --> 01:01:33,483
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry?

715
01:01:34,443 --> 01:01:36,805
[SPEAKER_02]: We got nacho this time.

716
01:01:37,065 --> 01:01:38,466
[SPEAKER_02]: Nacho cheese this time.

717
01:01:38,486 --> 01:01:39,407
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, what's on your mind?

718
01:01:40,468 --> 01:01:43,249
[SPEAKER_27]: Uh, I'm really hyped for Mario Kart DS.

719
01:01:44,315 --> 01:01:45,736
[SPEAKER_04]: You're hyped for Mario Kart DS.

720
01:01:45,796 --> 01:01:46,816
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm really hyped for this, too.

721
01:01:46,856 --> 01:01:51,339
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's going to be awesome to be able to play people across the internet and all that stuff.

722
01:01:51,999 --> 01:01:52,219
[SPEAKER_27]: Yeah.

723
01:01:53,440 --> 01:01:57,643
[SPEAKER_27]: The news video I just saw, what was it, 25 minutes?

724
01:01:58,043 --> 01:01:59,944
[SPEAKER_27]: Just revealed a bunch of stuff.

725
01:02:01,425 --> 01:02:01,885
[SPEAKER_04]: It's crazy.

726
01:02:02,505 --> 01:02:05,867
[SPEAKER_04]: So, this game's out, what, like a week from Tuesday or something?

727
01:02:05,887 --> 01:02:11,710
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's out, yeah, it's the week of the 14th, sometime during that week.

728
01:02:11,730 --> 01:02:12,531
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the date.

729
01:02:13,157 --> 01:02:14,017
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm excited for it.

730
01:02:14,117 --> 01:02:14,878
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to be a good time.

731
01:02:16,759 --> 01:02:20,861
[SPEAKER_04]: So now I hear you can have up to 50 people on your friends list or something through the game?

732
01:02:21,981 --> 01:02:22,361
[SPEAKER_27]: I don't know.

733
01:02:22,381 --> 01:02:23,162
[SPEAKER_27]: They didn't say that.

734
01:02:23,322 --> 01:02:25,163
[SPEAKER_27]: It's only four player though for the internet.

735
01:02:26,023 --> 01:02:30,125
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I'm not too surprised by that because eight people would be an awful lot of bandwidth to have going everywhere.

736
01:02:31,326 --> 01:02:33,087
[SPEAKER_27]: Yeah, you don't want all that lag and stuff.

737
01:02:33,407 --> 01:02:33,607
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

738
01:02:34,167 --> 01:02:35,248
[SPEAKER_04]: That sucks.

739
01:02:35,788 --> 01:02:37,829
[SPEAKER_04]: Any other games coming out soon that you're looking forward to?

740
01:02:38,359 --> 01:02:42,102
[SPEAKER_27]: You still have to give Midway Arcade Treasures 3 and DDR Mario Mix.

741
01:02:44,204 --> 01:02:47,166
[SPEAKER_04]: Midway Arcade Treasures 3 is pretty good.

742
01:02:47,366 --> 01:02:50,809
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a pretty solid game if you like racing games.

743
01:02:50,929 --> 01:03:02,318
[SPEAKER_22]: If you're waiting for more Midway Arcade stuff for the PSP, Arcade Treasures Extended Play is coming out in December, which is going to have a bunch of the old stuff plus Mortal Kombat 1 and 2.

744
01:03:03,459 --> 01:03:03,879
[SPEAKER_05]: Very cool.

745
01:03:04,454 --> 01:03:04,975
[SPEAKER_22]: I know about that.

746
01:03:05,715 --> 01:03:06,176
[SPEAKER_05]: Very cool.

747
01:03:07,297 --> 01:03:08,638
[SPEAKER_27]: Alright, anything else you want to share with our listeners?

748
01:03:09,259 --> 01:03:09,679
[SPEAKER_27]: Oh, yeah.

749
01:03:10,280 --> 01:03:11,661
[SPEAKER_27]: I got a link to this one site.

750
01:03:12,082 --> 01:03:19,149
[SPEAKER_27]: There's this guy who has made tons of progress on hacking the DS's Wi-Fi chip and stuff.

751
01:03:19,589 --> 01:03:21,431
[SPEAKER_27]: He's pretty much got it technically running.

752
01:03:22,252 --> 01:03:22,752
[SPEAKER_04]: Huh.

753
01:03:23,093 --> 01:03:24,154
[SPEAKER_04]: So what does it do?

754
01:03:25,935 --> 01:03:30,117
[SPEAKER_27]: Um, right now he's just trying to make the connection to a Wi-Fi hotspot.

755
01:03:30,857 --> 01:03:43,262
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, this is the guy that's, he's already won the bounty, basically, for the Wi-Fi, and now he's just finishing up, like, the last bit of it, but he finished enough of it to where they gave him, like, I think it was like $4,000.

756
01:03:43,362 --> 01:03:46,724
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I remember you mentioning that on a previous podcast about that.

757
01:03:47,104 --> 01:03:47,484
[SPEAKER_04]: Very cool.

758
01:03:47,504 --> 01:03:47,584
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah.

759
01:03:53,050 --> 01:03:56,273
[SPEAKER_04]: That link's in our chatroom, www.orangeandradio.com, click on chat.

760
01:03:58,074 --> 01:04:07,382
[SPEAKER_27]: Another thing, just more Mario Kart DS stuff, there's actually the decal maker, you know what I'm talking about?

761
01:04:07,462 --> 01:04:08,743
[SPEAKER_27]: The decals, you can have in it.

762
01:04:10,784 --> 01:04:11,685
[SPEAKER_04]: On Mario Kart?

763
01:04:11,725 --> 01:04:14,728
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, can't you make your own decal or something when you're on the internet?

764
01:04:15,293 --> 01:04:23,422
[SPEAKER_27]: Yeah, uh, just, it, like, has a thing that'll connect to your name and also actually go on your cart on, like, the front of it and stuff.

765
01:04:23,602 --> 01:04:24,483
[SPEAKER_27]: Yeah, that sounds kinda cool.

766
01:04:25,164 --> 01:04:26,165
[SPEAKER_27]: I'm gonna post another link.

767
01:04:26,185 --> 01:04:29,409
[SPEAKER_27]: They actually have a, like, decal base on this site.

768
01:04:30,690 --> 01:04:34,891
[SPEAKER_27]: And you can make one before the game's even out, which is really cool.

769
01:04:35,671 --> 01:04:37,212
[SPEAKER_27]: I've got one here.

770
01:04:38,612 --> 01:04:43,554
[SPEAKER_27]: It's actually the Firefox logo, and it looks really good for just 17 colors.

771
01:04:44,874 --> 01:04:49,395
[SPEAKER_27]: It uses that technique of crisscrossing colors, you know what I'm talking about?

772
01:04:49,535 --> 01:04:50,536
[SPEAKER_27]: Yeah, yeah.

773
01:04:50,556 --> 01:04:51,816
[SPEAKER_27]: To make them look like a different color.

774
01:04:52,356 --> 01:04:52,996
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, I'm going to check that.

775
01:04:53,196 --> 01:04:55,657
[SPEAKER_04]: So wait, you can make this before the game is out?

776
01:04:55,717 --> 01:04:57,717
[SPEAKER_04]: So you'll be able to transfer it from your PC somehow?

777
01:04:57,737 --> 01:05:02,318
[SPEAKER_27]: Well, you're not going to be able to transfer it, but you can plan it out and make one already.

778
01:05:02,358 --> 01:05:04,979
[SPEAKER_27]: You're going to have to recreate it, unfortunately.

779
01:05:05,159 --> 01:05:07,979
[SPEAKER_27]: Mr. Game & Watch!

780
01:05:10,100 --> 01:05:12,460
[SPEAKER_04]: Jamie's getting excited over there because she saw Mr. Game & Watch.

781
01:05:13,860 --> 01:05:14,781
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that's funny.

782
01:05:14,961 --> 01:05:15,901
[SPEAKER_04]: Awesome, it's going to be a good time.

783
01:05:16,161 --> 01:05:21,202
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, well thanks for sharing all those links with us, and we'll be all ready to kick your ass when Mario Kart DS comes out.

784
01:05:21,992 --> 01:05:24,893
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, don't be so sure about that.

785
01:05:25,253 --> 01:05:26,893
[SPEAKER_04]: It's on.

786
01:05:27,794 --> 01:05:30,594
[SPEAKER_04]: We will have some type of Orange Lounge DS-a-thon, I'm sure.

787
01:05:31,195 --> 01:05:40,517
[SPEAKER_04]: I know my dream is to have the Orange Lounge Village on Animal Crossing, where you can come to our town and have Jamie whack you with a bug net.

788
01:05:41,538 --> 01:05:43,358
[SPEAKER_04]: That would be a good time.

789
01:05:43,378 --> 01:05:45,419
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll have that set up Sunday nights during the show or something.

790
01:05:45,639 --> 01:05:47,479
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll have the Orange Lounge Village where you can come.

791
01:05:48,179 --> 01:05:49,340
[SPEAKER_04]: I have all these great ideas.

792
01:05:49,400 --> 01:05:49,820
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't wait.

793
01:05:51,331 --> 01:05:51,571
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

794
01:05:51,772 --> 01:05:52,092
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

795
01:05:52,152 --> 01:05:52,752
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, have a good one.

796
01:05:52,773 --> 01:05:53,333
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for calling.

797
01:05:53,954 --> 01:05:54,214
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks.

798
01:05:54,414 --> 01:05:54,674
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

799
01:05:54,714 --> 01:05:54,975
[SPEAKER_04]: Later.

800
01:05:56,977 --> 01:05:58,859
[SPEAKER_04]: Lots and lots of people hammering the line tonight.

801
01:05:58,899 --> 01:06:00,821
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's go to one more call for now.

802
01:06:01,581 --> 01:06:02,662
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

803
01:06:03,547 --> 01:06:04,728
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi, this is GS191.

804
01:06:04,848 --> 01:06:07,710
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, GS191, what's on your mind?

805
01:06:08,630 --> 01:06:12,913
[SPEAKER_05]: I just want to come on and whore out the Orange Launch Radio frapper.

806
01:06:13,334 --> 01:06:18,297
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, now, the frapper, this was something that you created that you were plugging on the forums.

807
01:06:18,337 --> 01:06:19,077
[SPEAKER_04]: This is pretty cool.

808
01:06:19,097 --> 01:06:19,978
[SPEAKER_04]: Tell our listeners about this.

809
01:06:21,519 --> 01:06:32,326
[SPEAKER_05]: It basically just lets you, like, you can, like, let listeners, like... Are you still there?

810
01:06:32,366 --> 01:06:33,207
[SPEAKER_28]: You cut out for a minute there.

811
01:06:33,755 --> 01:06:35,497
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, yeah, I'm thinking.

812
01:06:35,638 --> 01:06:35,898
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry.

813
01:06:36,038 --> 01:06:36,419
[SPEAKER_04]: It's alright.

814
01:06:36,639 --> 01:06:37,941
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me help you out.

815
01:06:37,981 --> 01:06:40,344
[SPEAKER_04]: It looks like something that's based off of Google Maps or something?

816
01:06:40,404 --> 01:06:41,546
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, it is.

817
01:06:41,666 --> 01:06:43,248
[SPEAKER_04]: And it allows you to plot points?

818
01:06:44,089 --> 01:06:44,309
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

819
01:06:44,369 --> 01:06:49,697
[SPEAKER_04]: Kind of so, but you guys as the listeners can plot points on this map so we can see where you live.

820
01:06:50,796 --> 01:06:51,397
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, pretty much.

821
01:06:51,877 --> 01:06:52,778
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm going to post a link.

822
01:06:52,858 --> 01:06:54,940
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, it looks like we both did at the same time there.

823
01:06:55,220 --> 01:07:04,549
[SPEAKER_04]: Post a link to the official Orange Lounge Radio Frapper, so you guys should go visit it and plot yourself on the map, and that way we can see just where all our listeners are.

824
01:07:04,609 --> 01:07:11,355
[SPEAKER_04]: And so when we see that we have a lot of listeners in one area, we might have to go, oh, we better send somebody to a tournament or something, get some coverage out there.

825
01:07:11,375 --> 01:07:11,455
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

826
01:07:12,429 --> 01:07:13,790
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah, yeah.

827
01:07:35,274 --> 01:07:37,717
[SPEAKER_04]: So go add yourself to the frapper, boys and girls.

828
01:07:38,178 --> 01:07:45,929
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you're not in the chat room and couldn't get the link, it's www.frappr.com slash Orange Lounge Radio.

829
01:07:49,460 --> 01:07:59,088
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, well thank you so much for making that and suggesting that, GS191, and I hope we get tons of people on it, so we can be giddy map people, I don't know.

830
01:08:00,250 --> 01:08:00,490
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

831
01:08:01,531 --> 01:08:02,031
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure, thanks.

832
01:08:02,111 --> 01:08:02,452
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, sure.

833
01:08:02,632 --> 01:08:03,252
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, take care.

834
01:08:03,272 --> 01:08:04,654
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, you too, bye.

835
01:08:04,674 --> 01:08:04,854
[SPEAKER_04]: Bye.

836
01:08:06,229 --> 01:08:08,970
[SPEAKER_28]: All right, we're going to go ahead and turn off the Skype line for now.

837
01:08:08,990 --> 01:08:11,312
[SPEAKER_04]: We will take more calls a little later on in the program.

838
01:08:12,152 --> 01:08:17,835
[SPEAKER_04]: However, I think at this point, we're going to go ahead and get into the Orange Lounge Radio cage match for tonight.

839
01:08:17,915 --> 01:08:19,095
[SPEAKER_04]: Does that sound like fun, boys and girls?

840
01:08:19,896 --> 01:08:20,076
[SPEAKER_13]: Oui.

841
01:08:20,956 --> 01:08:30,263
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, so I gotta get the Cage Match music queued up, but of course we had a retiree from last week, so we're gonna have three brand new songs in tonight's Cage Match.

842
01:08:30,283 --> 01:08:34,106
[SPEAKER_04]: So tonight's Cage Match is gonna take a little more time than usual, because we're gonna have three songs in their entirety.

843
01:08:35,307 --> 01:08:36,008
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's get it started.

844
01:08:37,486 --> 01:08:44,490
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, the way the Orange Lounge Radio Cage Match works is that you have to be in our chat room at www.orangeloungeradio.com.

845
01:08:44,850 --> 01:09:00,360
[SPEAKER_04]: We are going to play three songs for you, and since there is no reigning champion, because we retired last week's winner, as it was its fourth win in a row, that was Pendulum with Hold Your Color, that song was retired, we're going to play three brand new songs for you in their entirety, okay?

846
01:09:00,880 --> 01:09:18,665
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you're going to vote for your favorite in our chatroom at www.orangeloungeradio.com and your favorite song that you guys vote for will go into rotation all week long on Orange Lounge Radio's 24-hour day, 7-day-a-week, Bimani and Video Game Music program, which has had a lot of you guys listening to it lately, so we appreciate that.

847
01:09:19,305 --> 01:09:20,766
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, so let's get it started.

848
01:09:20,806 --> 01:09:24,447
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess I will go ahead since I technically...

849
01:09:25,433 --> 01:09:26,835
[SPEAKER_04]: Hold Your Color by Pendulum

850
01:09:44,537 --> 01:09:45,378
[SPEAKER_04]: Depeche Mode Precious

851
01:10:19,660 --> 01:10:29,564
[SPEAKER_15]: Precious and fragile things Need special handling My God, what have we done to you?

852
01:10:29,604 --> 01:10:35,167
[SPEAKER_15]: We always tried to share The tenderest of care Now look what we have

853
01:11:28,164 --> 01:11:36,651
[SPEAKER_15]: Angels with silver wings Shoulder no suffering I wish I could take the pain for you If God has a master plan That only he understands I hope it's

854
01:12:09,240 --> 01:12:10,485
I thought we'd manage

855
01:12:58,641 --> 01:13:00,382
[SPEAKER_15]: Thanks for watching!

856
01:14:02,645 --> 01:14:04,926
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, that was song number one in tonight's cage match.

857
01:14:04,946 --> 01:14:06,666
[SPEAKER_04]: That was Depeche Mode with Precious.

858
01:14:07,086 --> 01:14:09,747
[SPEAKER_04]: Was that song the Precious or was that song the crappy?

859
01:14:10,527 --> 01:14:12,147
[SPEAKER_04]: Our judges in studio will let you know.

860
01:14:12,327 --> 01:14:12,968
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura.

861
01:14:13,388 --> 01:14:20,410
[SPEAKER_07]: I haven't really cared for anything Depeche Mode's done since the 80s because as I'm, you know, prone to calling them depressed mode.

862
01:14:20,850 --> 01:14:21,950
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, there's a little emo.

863
01:14:26,781 --> 01:14:27,783
[SPEAKER_07]: It's very sedate.

864
01:14:28,083 --> 01:14:35,054
[SPEAKER_07]: It actually reminds me of some of the stuff from Silent Hill 3 along the same lines.

865
01:14:36,376 --> 01:14:37,157
[SPEAKER_07]: I like it a lot.

866
01:14:37,637 --> 01:14:38,719
[SPEAKER_07]: As listening, it gets a 10.

867
01:14:39,200 --> 01:14:40,241
[SPEAKER_07]: For cage magic, it gets an 8.

868
01:14:41,263 --> 01:14:42,484
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, it is a little emo.

869
01:14:42,584 --> 01:14:43,585
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll go ahead and do my ranking.

870
01:14:43,865 --> 01:14:50,749
[SPEAKER_04]: It is a little emo and a little sad for Cage Match, but I'm in a chill mood lately, where I'm in an emo mood, I guess.

871
01:14:50,789 --> 01:14:51,269
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll admit it.

872
01:14:51,490 --> 01:14:52,570
[SPEAKER_04]: I can be emo once in a while.

873
01:14:53,011 --> 01:14:54,972
[SPEAKER_04]: So I give that song an 8 as well.

874
01:14:55,512 --> 01:14:55,872
[SPEAKER_04]: It's fun.

875
01:14:56,233 --> 01:14:56,533
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki.

876
01:14:57,453 --> 01:15:04,678
[SPEAKER_22]: Now, I think, I was going to say, Depeche Mode is kind of going the way of Crystal Method, where their last album sucked.

877
01:15:05,302 --> 01:15:08,042
[SPEAKER_22]: Crystal Method's last album sucks, but the one before it was really good.

878
01:15:08,923 --> 01:15:17,364
[SPEAKER_22]: And this one, if this is one of the best songs on the album, then I'm kind of leery because I really did like Exciter.

879
01:15:17,684 --> 01:15:19,905
[SPEAKER_22]: That was one of my favorite Depeche Mode albums.

880
01:15:20,705 --> 01:15:24,965
[SPEAKER_22]: And this one, it's okay, but I have to listen to the rest of it before I can make my judgment on the whole thing.

881
01:15:24,985 --> 01:15:26,306
[SPEAKER_22]: But I give it an 8.

882
01:15:26,406 --> 01:15:27,086
[SPEAKER_22]: It's pretty good.

883
01:15:27,146 --> 01:15:28,866
[SPEAKER_22]: It's just Depeche Mode can't really do wrong.

884
01:15:28,986 --> 01:15:31,507
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

885
01:15:31,527 --> 01:15:32,907
[SPEAKER_04]: 8, 8, 8, and now it's Angel's turn.

886
01:15:32,927 --> 01:15:33,867
[SPEAKER_04]: Angel, what do you think?

887
01:15:35,259 --> 01:15:36,160
[SPEAKER_07]: It's Depeche Mode.

888
01:15:36,260 --> 01:15:36,960
[SPEAKER_07]: It's cool.

889
01:15:39,042 --> 01:15:39,222
[SPEAKER_07]: Eight.

890
01:15:40,083 --> 01:15:42,785
[SPEAKER_04]: Right, I somehow knew she'd give it an eight as well.

891
01:15:43,626 --> 01:15:44,706
[SPEAKER_04]: How could you not at that point?

892
01:15:44,726 --> 01:15:46,788
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, eights across the board for Depeche Mode Precious.

893
01:15:47,048 --> 01:15:49,971
[SPEAKER_04]: But remember, it's not up to us to decide.

894
01:15:50,311 --> 01:15:51,492
[SPEAKER_04]: Our scores don't mean shit.

895
01:15:51,592 --> 01:15:52,953
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like that game Whose Line Is Anyway.

896
01:15:52,973 --> 01:15:53,954
[SPEAKER_04]: The scores don't mean shit.

897
01:15:54,294 --> 01:15:55,895
[SPEAKER_04]: It's up to you guys and your votes in the chatroom.

898
01:15:55,915 --> 01:15:57,877
[SPEAKER_04]: We're just kind of coaxing you.

899
01:15:58,337 --> 01:16:01,939
[SPEAKER_07]: I believe that was the first time we've done that across the board, actually.

900
01:16:02,019 --> 01:16:02,459
[SPEAKER_04]: In a while.

901
01:16:02,519 --> 01:16:03,440
[SPEAKER_04]: I know it's been done before.

902
01:16:03,680 --> 01:16:10,103
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I remember, as soon as I remember, there was a mix of girls who was in the cage match once that got like zeros across the board from everybody, including Loki.

903
01:16:12,104 --> 01:16:15,166
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, let's go on to the next song, the second song of tonight's cage match.

904
01:16:15,186 --> 01:16:16,446
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to go ahead and do Loki's pick.

905
01:16:16,606 --> 01:16:17,547
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki, what'd you pick tonight?

906
01:16:19,891 --> 01:16:22,452
[SPEAKER_22]: I picked a song that's off of the CD.

907
01:16:22,812 --> 01:16:26,353
[SPEAKER_04]: It's actually pretty cool.

908
01:16:26,413 --> 01:16:31,555
[SPEAKER_04]: Kalinda, I've never heard of them before, but they're on one of those compilation trance CDs.

909
01:16:32,055 --> 01:16:33,035
[SPEAKER_04]: And it sounded pretty good.

910
01:16:33,275 --> 01:16:34,276
[SPEAKER_04]: It's upbeat, short.

911
01:16:35,296 --> 01:16:36,216
[SPEAKER_04]: That's all you need to know.

912
01:16:36,477 --> 01:16:37,257
[SPEAKER_04]: It's upbeat and short.

913
01:16:37,877 --> 01:16:39,377
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, well we'll be the judges of that.

914
01:16:39,438 --> 01:16:41,538
[SPEAKER_04]: Here it is, song number two in tonight's cage match.

915
01:16:41,818 --> 01:16:43,559
[SPEAKER_04]: Kalinda with I'll Surrender.

916
01:18:57,191 --> 01:19:02,278
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm giving up this fight I'm giving up this fight

917
01:20:22,506 --> 01:20:24,587
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, that was song number two in tonight's cage match.

918
01:20:24,607 --> 01:20:28,509
[SPEAKER_04]: That was Kalinda, or maybe Kalienda, with I'll Surrender.

919
01:20:28,829 --> 01:20:31,330
[SPEAKER_04]: Will you surrender to that song, or will you hold it hostage?

920
01:20:31,990 --> 01:20:32,491
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura.

921
01:20:32,571 --> 01:20:33,491
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't want to do either.

922
01:20:34,792 --> 01:20:35,692
[SPEAKER_07]: It was generic.

923
01:20:35,712 --> 01:20:36,792
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's a five.

924
01:20:38,733 --> 01:20:46,717
[SPEAKER_04]: I have to admit, usually those are the types of songs I'm a sucker for, and there was some lovely instrumentation in that song, and the woman did have a pretty voice, but I just...

925
01:20:47,728 --> 01:20:49,349
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm too emo for that song tonight.

926
01:20:49,729 --> 01:20:54,972
[SPEAKER_04]: I really am in an emo mood today, so I can't appreciate that song as much as I should, so I have to give it like a 6.

927
01:20:55,932 --> 01:20:56,752
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm very sorry, Loki.

928
01:20:56,872 --> 01:20:57,153
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki.

929
01:20:57,993 --> 01:21:06,077
[SPEAKER_22]: It gets an 8, and ironically enough, that's the amount of max sim files that have been posted to my cell since they've relaunched.

930
01:21:06,897 --> 01:21:07,358
[SPEAKER_04]: Beautiful.

931
01:21:07,858 --> 01:21:12,640
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, Angel, what did you think of I'll Surrender?

932
01:21:12,660 --> 01:21:13,781
[SPEAKER_07]: It was okay.

933
01:21:16,315 --> 01:21:17,556
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, 7 1⁄2.

934
01:21:17,797 --> 01:21:19,899
[SPEAKER_07]: Nice.

935
01:21:19,979 --> 01:21:20,579
[SPEAKER_04]: 7 1⁄2 from Angel.

936
01:21:20,659 --> 01:21:23,742
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, song number three tonight is DarkSakura's pick.

937
01:21:23,802 --> 01:21:25,163
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, what did you choose for us?

938
01:21:26,004 --> 01:21:28,406
[SPEAKER_07]: Only by Nine Inch Nails, just because.

939
01:21:28,867 --> 01:21:29,407
[SPEAKER_04]: Just because?

940
01:21:30,228 --> 01:21:31,890
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I've been in the mood.

941
01:21:31,930 --> 01:21:36,194
[SPEAKER_04]: Is this like one of their hard-hitting industrial songs, or is this kind of a... You'll find out.

942
01:21:36,594 --> 01:21:37,675
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, well, oh snap.

943
01:21:37,755 --> 01:21:38,316
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, we will.

944
01:21:38,376 --> 01:21:38,856
[SPEAKER_04]: Here we go.

945
01:21:39,337 --> 01:21:41,659
[SPEAKER_04]: Song number three is Nine Inch Nails with Only.

946
01:21:56,738 --> 01:21:57,805
Thanks for watching!

947
01:22:42,057 --> 01:22:43,579
[SPEAKER_15]: Thanks for watching!

948
01:23:38,069 --> 01:23:43,164
I just want you all to remember me myself again And I just want you all to know

949
01:24:34,471 --> 01:24:35,697
[SPEAKER_15]: Thanks for watching!

950
01:26:10,536 --> 01:26:15,520
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, that was... Sorry, I'm laughing because they're having the soda versus pop debate in chat.

951
01:26:15,540 --> 01:26:16,782
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll get to that in a minute.

952
01:26:16,802 --> 01:26:21,185
[SPEAKER_04]: For now, let's review song number three, Nine Inch Nails with Only.

953
01:26:21,225 --> 01:26:28,952
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that the only song for you, or is that a song you would like to, I don't know, equivalent to Nine Inch Nails on a chalkboard?

954
01:26:30,513 --> 01:26:30,994
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura.

955
01:26:36,697 --> 01:26:53,405
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, it's not the usual Nine Inch Nails song, and if I was in a normal mood, I would probably penalize the song for not sounding like a normal Nine Inch Nails song.

956
01:26:53,745 --> 01:26:55,626
[SPEAKER_04]: However, it fits my emo mood.

957
01:26:55,646 --> 01:26:57,347
[SPEAKER_04]: Therefore, it gets a bonus point, and I give it a 9.

958
01:26:59,760 --> 01:27:04,282
[SPEAKER_04]: I am in a normal mood, and I'm going to penalize it for not being a normal Nine Inch Nails song.

959
01:27:04,862 --> 01:27:07,484
[SPEAKER_04]: It gets a 5.

960
01:27:09,164 --> 01:27:12,766
[SPEAKER_04]: Angel has left the room momentarily, but we would assume that she would give it a 10.

961
01:27:14,026 --> 01:27:15,307
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, yeah, she gave everything else an 8 tonight.

962
01:27:15,367 --> 01:27:15,987
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, there's Angel.

963
01:27:16,728 --> 01:27:18,388
[SPEAKER_04]: What would you give that song, Nine Inch Nails only?

964
01:27:21,350 --> 01:27:21,470
[SPEAKER_29]: An 8.

965
01:27:22,725 --> 01:27:24,185
[SPEAKER_04]: See, there you go.

966
01:27:24,505 --> 01:27:27,366
[SPEAKER_04]: But remember, it's not up to us, it's up to you.

967
01:27:27,846 --> 01:27:29,946
[SPEAKER_04]: Here are the three songs you can vote for tonight.

968
01:27:29,986 --> 01:27:32,367
[SPEAKER_04]: A quick recap in tonight's cage match.

969
01:27:32,407 --> 01:27:34,667
[SPEAKER_04]: Three brand new songs, no returning champions.

970
01:27:34,707 --> 01:27:36,588
[SPEAKER_04]: Song number one, Precious, Depeche Mode.

971
01:27:43,069 --> 01:27:47,450
[SPEAKER_04]: And song number two you can vote for tonight is Kalenda with I'll Surrender.

972
01:27:55,235 --> 01:27:58,431
[SPEAKER_04]: And song number three you can vote for tonight is Nine Inch Nails with Only

973
01:28:06,458 --> 01:28:09,702
[SPEAKER_04]: All right kids, place vote now.

974
01:28:10,162 --> 01:28:19,051
[SPEAKER_04]: Send a private message to Sky in the chat room with your vote for Depeche Mode, song number one, Calienda, song number two, or Nine Inch Nails, song number three.

975
01:28:19,451 --> 01:28:19,731
[SPEAKER_04]: Do it.

976
01:28:19,851 --> 01:28:20,352
[SPEAKER_04]: Do it now.

977
01:28:20,452 --> 01:28:21,613
[SPEAKER_04]: All the cool kids are doing it.

978
01:28:21,653 --> 01:28:26,258
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you don't, you are going to get a massive wedgie from all of us.

979
01:28:27,728 --> 01:28:34,274
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki, what's going on in the sim scene, dare I ask, in the Dance Dance Revolution and other music gaming simulation?

980
01:28:34,734 --> 01:28:42,661
[SPEAKER_22]: As I mentioned before, with the eight brand new Max remixes, not much as far as the sim file section goes on my cell, or at least all the...

981
01:28:44,063 --> 01:28:47,526
[SPEAKER_22]: Submissions, but there is another tournament going on.

982
01:28:47,926 --> 01:29:12,403
[SPEAKER_22]: Since TourneyMix is gone for good, hopefully, we have OSC 4, or the original step file competition 4, and basically the rules are a little bit different than TourneyMix, and basically the main stuff is... Let's see here...

983
01:29:14,008 --> 01:29:20,374
[SPEAKER_22]: Basically, the staff can't enter, which is probably good, because why would they be voting on their own songs?

984
01:29:21,374 --> 01:29:29,882
[SPEAKER_22]: But anyways, there's going to be one... I don't know, it looks exactly the same to me, to be honest.

985
01:29:29,902 --> 01:29:32,784
[SPEAKER_22]: They have different divisions, DDR, Indigroove, and Keyboard.

986
01:29:33,364 --> 01:29:40,551
[SPEAKER_22]: So I'm guessing Playable, Not Quite Playable, and Not Playable would be those three categories.

987
01:29:41,291 --> 01:29:41,471
[SPEAKER_22]: And...

988
01:29:43,114 --> 01:29:47,458
[SPEAKER_22]: It doesn't really say when the submissions are due yet, but let's see.

989
01:29:47,638 --> 01:29:49,020
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, my mistake.

990
01:29:49,440 --> 01:29:50,581
[SPEAKER_04]: November 13th is one.

991
01:29:51,743 --> 01:29:54,045
[SPEAKER_04]: So you said that Tournamix is gone forever?

992
01:29:54,866 --> 01:29:55,346
[SPEAKER_04]: Supposedly.

993
01:29:58,930 --> 01:30:02,954
[SPEAKER_22]: There's no public voting, so basically it's just by panel review.

994
01:30:05,470 --> 01:30:11,371
[SPEAKER_22]: The public, though, can post the reviews for the songs in each division when they're released and rank it.

995
01:30:11,971 --> 01:30:19,273
[SPEAKER_22]: And the average score from the public review is then taken and will make up 50% of the song's final division score.

996
01:30:20,993 --> 01:30:27,355
[SPEAKER_22]: And hopefully, hopefully, they will post, or they won't post, who the song was made by.

997
01:30:27,975 --> 01:30:28,995
[SPEAKER_22]: You know, then make it fair.

998
01:30:29,355 --> 01:30:32,036
[SPEAKER_22]: But I don't think that's going to happen.

999
01:30:33,922 --> 01:30:41,809
[SPEAKER_22]: So yeah, that's about it other than Dance Tracks, a new Stepmania-based game making its way to the web.

1000
01:30:43,610 --> 01:30:46,453
[SPEAKER_22]: And of course, hopefully pretty soon, the arcades.

1001
01:30:47,954 --> 01:30:57,522
[SPEAKER_22]: No real details on it at all other than the fact that you've got people like DM Ashura, B-Drop, and just other people doing music for it.

1002
01:30:58,183 --> 01:30:59,604
[SPEAKER_22]: So, it'll be interesting.

1003
01:31:01,446 --> 01:31:01,706
[SPEAKER_04]: That's it.

1004
01:31:03,357 --> 01:31:03,717
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1005
01:31:05,578 --> 01:31:13,301
[SPEAKER_04]: Moving on, DarkSakura, I know you were surfing the web a little bit there in the background, and you found some pictures from an upcoming movie that we're very excited about.

1006
01:31:13,321 --> 01:31:15,342
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought maybe you wanted to share this with our listeners.

1007
01:31:15,722 --> 01:31:16,643
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, yeah.

1008
01:31:16,783 --> 01:31:20,304
[SPEAKER_07]: Silent Hill movie image is up on IGN.

1009
01:31:20,364 --> 01:31:23,406
[SPEAKER_07]: One of our listeners linked it on our website, on our forums.

1010
01:31:25,626 --> 01:31:33,209
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyone who was basically naysaying, if these images are any type of indication, it is Silent Hill.

1011
01:31:33,329 --> 01:31:33,929
[SPEAKER_07]: It's official.

1012
01:31:35,349 --> 01:31:36,830
[SPEAKER_07]: Very, very perfect.

1013
01:31:38,991 --> 01:31:43,332
[SPEAKER_07]: Down to the environment, down to the...

1014
01:31:48,047 --> 01:31:50,788
[SPEAKER_07]: Even the colors that the characters are dressed in is very somber.

1015
01:31:51,629 --> 01:31:53,009
[SPEAKER_07]: It completely matches the style.

1016
01:31:53,349 --> 01:31:54,970
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm very excited after seeing the pictures.

1017
01:31:55,030 --> 01:31:56,671
[SPEAKER_04]: It looks like they're going to get it right.

1018
01:31:56,711 --> 01:31:59,192
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm so excited that they might get a video game movie right.

1019
01:31:59,232 --> 01:32:00,113
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just elated.

1020
01:32:00,613 --> 01:32:02,153
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm very, very happy about that.

1021
01:32:02,193 --> 01:32:05,075
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course, then again, the Mortal Kombat pictures were cool when I first saw them, too.

1022
01:32:05,455 --> 01:32:06,335
[SPEAKER_04]: But I have hope.

1023
01:32:06,715 --> 01:32:09,897
[SPEAKER_07]: These three can look like they're from the game, only better quality, of course.

1024
01:32:10,197 --> 01:32:18,541
[SPEAKER_04]: In other news, during the Saw II of the previews, they played Blood Rains, which I yelled out in the middle of the audience, A MOVIE FUCKING SUCKS!

1025
01:32:19,041 --> 01:32:19,701
[SPEAKER_04]: Everyone laughed.

1026
01:32:21,662 --> 01:32:23,203
[SPEAKER_07]: I need to see Doom so I can laugh at it.

1027
01:32:24,783 --> 01:32:26,884
[SPEAKER_04]: I think Doom has already fallen out of the top ten movies.

1028
01:32:27,385 --> 01:32:28,005
[SPEAKER_04]: It's gone.

1029
01:32:28,205 --> 01:32:28,565
[SPEAKER_04]: It's gone.

1030
01:32:29,125 --> 01:32:31,807
[SPEAKER_04]: And made, I think, like half of its budget back, if even that.

1031
01:32:34,515 --> 01:32:35,316
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see, what else?

1032
01:32:36,016 --> 01:32:41,298
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, did you guys hear this week what movie has got a push to be made now?

1033
01:32:42,679 --> 01:32:47,781
[SPEAKER_04]: A video game movie was licensed out and now has a director attached and the script's being written for?

1034
01:32:48,261 --> 01:32:49,141
[SPEAKER_04]: Castlevania.

1035
01:32:49,802 --> 01:32:51,482
[SPEAKER_04]: Castlevania's being turned into a movie.

1036
01:32:51,823 --> 01:32:53,723
[SPEAKER_04]: It better be done right, that's all I can say.

1037
01:32:53,803 --> 01:32:55,424
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's who's attached to direct.

1038
01:32:55,764 --> 01:32:57,365
[SPEAKER_04]: I believe his name is Paul Anderson.

1039
01:32:57,405 --> 01:32:59,586
[SPEAKER_04]: He was the guy that did Mortal Kombat and Resident Evil.

1040
01:32:59,986 --> 01:33:03,499
[SPEAKER_07]: Well now, Mortal Kombat was a good movie and Resident Evil was a good movie.

1041
01:33:04,645 --> 01:33:06,607
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I like Resident Evil, shut up.

1042
01:33:07,207 --> 01:33:08,008
[SPEAKER_04]: They were fun.

1043
01:33:08,288 --> 01:33:08,728
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll give it that.

1044
01:33:08,768 --> 01:33:09,469
[SPEAKER_04]: They were fun movies.

1045
01:33:09,489 --> 01:33:11,511
[SPEAKER_04]: They weren't Oscar caliber movies, but they were fun.

1046
01:33:11,531 --> 01:33:12,812
[SPEAKER_04]: Mortal Kombat, I think, was done right.

1047
01:33:12,832 --> 01:33:14,433
[SPEAKER_04]: They were tolerable.

1048
01:33:15,574 --> 01:33:19,457
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, when you put them next to a UE Bowl movie, I mean, honestly, it doesn't look that bad.

1049
01:33:19,737 --> 01:33:20,618
[SPEAKER_04]: They actually are pretty good.

1050
01:33:20,658 --> 01:33:25,762
[SPEAKER_04]: Mortal Kombat was, you put Mortal Kombat, the movie, next to Street Fighter, the movie, and it's like, oh, I'll watch Mortal Kombat like 20 times.

1051
01:33:25,982 --> 01:33:26,363
[SPEAKER_04]: Seriously.

1052
01:33:26,663 --> 01:33:31,487
[SPEAKER_04]: So, honestly, probably Paul Anderson, to date, has set the bar for

1053
01:33:32,087 --> 01:33:34,549
[SPEAKER_04]: A decent video game movie that is yet to be exceeded.

1054
01:33:34,709 --> 01:33:38,391
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think there has been a better video game movie than Mortal Kombat or Resident Evil.

1055
01:33:38,511 --> 01:33:41,293
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm quite excited about the Peter Jackson Halo.

1056
01:33:41,613 --> 01:33:46,656
[SPEAKER_04]: But see, with Silent Hill on deck and Halo eventually, I think it's going to push the bar up.

1057
01:33:47,036 --> 01:33:47,256
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm hoping.

1058
01:33:47,276 --> 01:33:47,676
[SPEAKER_04]: I hope so too.

1059
01:33:47,756 --> 01:33:50,938
[SPEAKER_04]: And Uwe Boll needs to stop making movies.

1060
01:33:51,499 --> 01:33:52,059
[SPEAKER_04]: Period.

1061
01:33:53,690 --> 01:33:57,551
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course we talked about on the last podcast the Dungeon Siege is going to be two movies.

1062
01:33:57,912 --> 01:33:58,992
[SPEAKER_04]: Four hours long.

1063
01:33:59,152 --> 01:34:00,813
[SPEAKER_04]: It's an epic Uwe Boll event.

1064
01:34:00,833 --> 01:34:20,139
[SPEAKER_22]: I have not actually seen an Uwe Boll movie yet just because they're so bad but I really need to sit down so I can nitpick them on particular issues because I know that just the movies overall are really bad and uninspiring and just awful but I'm kind of curious to see Blood Rain because at least she gets naked.

1065
01:34:20,399 --> 01:34:22,820
[SPEAKER_22]: So at least they've got that going for it.

1066
01:34:23,615 --> 01:34:25,116
[SPEAKER_22]: So, yeah, that'd be good.

1067
01:34:26,716 --> 01:34:29,317
[SPEAKER_07]: No, no, no, I don't even need it.

1068
01:34:29,337 --> 01:34:30,097
[SPEAKER_07]: Bye, bye.

1069
01:34:30,277 --> 01:34:31,738
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought you were going to comment on something.

1070
01:34:32,118 --> 01:34:35,639
[SPEAKER_04]: Weren't you excited about Castlevania, the movie, or as I call it, Castlevania?

1071
01:34:37,120 --> 01:34:37,880
[SPEAKER_07]: Mmm, Simon.

1072
01:34:38,100 --> 01:34:38,481
[SPEAKER_07]: Simon?

1073
01:34:39,281 --> 01:34:39,541
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

1074
01:34:40,714 --> 01:34:42,795
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's hope to hell to get the right actor to play Simon.

1075
01:34:43,095 --> 01:34:45,456
[SPEAKER_04]: I know, why don't they just have Hugh Jackman do it again?

1076
01:34:46,356 --> 01:34:46,957
[SPEAKER_04]: I have an idea.

1077
01:34:47,077 --> 01:34:50,558
[SPEAKER_04]: How about we get Vin Diesel to play Simon Belmont?

1078
01:34:51,358 --> 01:34:52,199
[SPEAKER_22]: How about no?

1079
01:34:52,879 --> 01:34:55,320
[SPEAKER_22]: Jim Carrey is Simon Belmont.

1080
01:34:55,380 --> 01:35:02,043
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, not to throw this topic in the gutter, but Vin Diesel is a very, very big joke around World of Warcraft right now.

1081
01:35:02,083 --> 01:35:02,563
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, whatever.

1082
01:35:04,824 --> 01:35:08,367
[SPEAKER_04]: Vin Diesel will play, Arnold Schwarzenegger will play all the characters in the movie.

1083
01:35:08,547 --> 01:35:10,729
[SPEAKER_04]: Dave Chappelle as Simon Belmont.

1084
01:35:12,791 --> 01:35:15,693
[SPEAKER_04]: Like Carlos Bensia as Dracula.

1085
01:35:18,495 --> 01:35:20,397
[SPEAKER_07]: And Pablo Francisco as the background effects?

1086
01:35:20,717 --> 01:35:21,258
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh, never mind.

1087
01:35:24,220 --> 01:35:26,622
[SPEAKER_04]: Jigsaw the Clown is Simon Belmont.

1088
01:35:26,642 --> 01:35:28,303
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me wait.

1089
01:35:30,512 --> 01:35:32,232
[SPEAKER_04]: Moving on, that should be interesting.

1090
01:35:33,613 --> 01:35:38,854
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh no, before we go to a break, I want to talk about Xbox 360.

1091
01:35:39,354 --> 01:35:41,594
[SPEAKER_04]: And of course, I want to bring this up again on the podcast a little later.

1092
01:35:42,014 --> 01:35:44,635
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, speaking of tonight's podcast, damn, I said I would get this out at some point.

1093
01:35:44,655 --> 01:35:49,376
[SPEAKER_04]: Tonight's podcast is going to be the winner, because we have not one, but two interviews on tonight's podcast.

1094
01:35:49,436 --> 01:35:50,056
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to be cool.

1095
01:35:50,696 --> 01:35:52,637
[SPEAKER_04]: We're actually going to be doing a follow-up.

1096
01:35:52,677 --> 01:35:59,718
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if you guys heard about this, but King's Quest 9, there was this fan project going on to create a fan version of King's Quest.

1097
01:36:00,018 --> 01:36:00,799
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for watching!

1098
01:36:15,253 --> 01:36:15,673
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for watching!

1099
01:36:34,645 --> 01:36:36,227
[SPEAKER_04]: KQIX as they call it for short.

1100
01:36:36,267 --> 01:36:36,907
[SPEAKER_04]: So tune into that.

1101
01:36:37,428 --> 01:36:45,876
[SPEAKER_04]: But also, this is something I probably will address on the podcast as well, but I have to bring this up on the live show because I get more time to rant here than I do on the podcast.

1102
01:36:46,216 --> 01:36:47,818
[SPEAKER_04]: And that has to do with Xbox 360.

1103
01:36:47,918 --> 01:36:51,201
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, Loki, you were saying that you're going to be getting yours on launch day.

1104
01:36:51,601 --> 01:36:55,645
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, every day I kind of question that more and more just because

1105
01:36:56,167 --> 01:37:19,775
[SPEAKER_22]: of what Microsoft's doing, they're trickling in the allocation, so it's like, okay, X store, you had 200 Xboxes, thank you for pre-selling all those, we're gonna send you 10, you know, or like, you know, stuff like that, it's just really ridiculous, the store I booked mine at is not as busy as the other store that I used to, the GameStop I used to pre-book stuff at was in the mall,

1106
01:37:20,259 --> 01:37:22,541
[SPEAKER_22]: You know, high traffic GameStop and stuff.

1107
01:37:22,601 --> 01:37:25,162
[SPEAKER_22]: And it was a bitch and a half to try to get anything from them.

1108
01:37:25,542 --> 01:37:30,466
[SPEAKER_22]: So now I've booked stuff now at the GameStop that's only a couple blocks from my house.

1109
01:37:30,526 --> 01:37:31,286
[SPEAKER_22]: It's really small.

1110
01:37:32,647 --> 01:37:34,849
[SPEAKER_22]: There's never really anyone in there and that type of stuff.

1111
01:37:35,149 --> 01:37:37,891
[SPEAKER_22]: So I'm hoping that there's not that many people that have booked them.

1112
01:37:38,691 --> 01:37:42,113
[SPEAKER_22]: And I got in on one of the few that they've got.

1113
01:37:42,313 --> 01:37:42,614
[SPEAKER_22]: But...

1114
01:37:43,434 --> 01:37:49,175
[SPEAKER_22]: Even like some of the stores that hardly have any pre-orders for them, they're not getting hardly anything.

1115
01:37:49,235 --> 01:37:51,576
[SPEAKER_22]: So it's really iffy.

1116
01:37:51,616 --> 01:37:55,417
[SPEAKER_22]: Hopefully I am because I've got two games on order there and two on order at my work.

1117
01:37:55,657 --> 01:37:58,097
[SPEAKER_22]: And so I'm really trying to get a lot of this stuff in.

1118
01:37:58,117 --> 01:38:03,478
[SPEAKER_04]: Plus I'm trying to butter up the people we sell to, the publishers, to have them send me some free stuff.

1119
01:38:03,519 --> 01:38:05,239
[SPEAKER_04]: But that's a whole other story.

1120
01:38:07,253 --> 01:38:10,357
[SPEAKER_04]: I got to play an Xbox 360 kiosk finally.

1121
01:38:10,517 --> 01:38:11,498
[SPEAKER_04]: Where's that at?

1122
01:38:11,639 --> 01:38:12,780
[SPEAKER_04]: Best Buy has them.

1123
01:38:12,980 --> 01:38:14,782
[SPEAKER_04]: Two of them in the area have the kiosk set up.

1124
01:38:15,003 --> 01:38:16,845
[SPEAKER_04]: The one over by Birdcage has one.

1125
01:38:16,865 --> 01:38:19,068
[SPEAKER_04]: That's where I played it yesterday.

1126
01:38:20,409 --> 01:38:24,534
[SPEAKER_04]: They have demos of Cameo and Call of Duty 2.

1127
01:38:25,055 --> 01:38:25,576
[SPEAKER_22]: And King Kong?

1128
01:38:26,036 --> 01:38:26,917
[SPEAKER_04]: No, just those two.

1129
01:38:27,137 --> 01:38:29,159
[SPEAKER_04]: Or at least those two were the only ones I noticed that were playable.

1130
01:38:29,539 --> 01:38:31,341
[SPEAKER_04]: I know they had videos of a bunch of other ones, too.

1131
01:38:31,381 --> 01:38:33,443
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't remember... King Kong's playable, usually.

1132
01:38:33,643 --> 01:38:35,425
[SPEAKER_04]: But it might be a different disc, who knows.

1133
01:38:36,066 --> 01:38:37,607
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, or I just missed it completely.

1134
01:38:37,627 --> 01:38:40,029
[SPEAKER_04]: But I did notice specifically those two games were playable.

1135
01:38:40,570 --> 01:38:44,333
[SPEAKER_04]: And I have to say, I was incredibly underwhelmed with Camp.

1136
01:38:44,353 --> 01:38:46,015
[SPEAKER_04]: Cameo was the one I really paid attention to.

1137
01:38:46,295 --> 01:38:50,700
[SPEAKER_04]: Call of Duty 2 had pretty graphics and stuff, but Cameo was a little bit underwhelming.

1138
01:38:51,460 --> 01:38:57,082
[SPEAKER_04]: I can see where people are making these Xbox 1.5 comparisons where it just looks slightly better than the Xbox.

1139
01:38:57,122 --> 01:38:58,643
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not that much better.

1140
01:38:58,663 --> 01:39:01,764
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm surprised because Cameo was actually one of the ones I was pretty impressed with.

1141
01:39:01,824 --> 01:39:05,485
[SPEAKER_22]: All the first party stuff seemed to be pretty good and Cameo was one of them.

1142
01:39:05,505 --> 01:39:20,270
[SPEAKER_22]: I don't know if maybe the particular level or the sub that they have is not very forgiving to the game but the one that we saw they were showing kind of like the draw distance of the game and stuff and there was like hundreds and thousands of like these creatures just battling on the

1143
01:39:20,710 --> 01:39:21,611
[SPEAKER_22]: and so on.

1144
01:39:51,460 --> 01:39:53,802
[SPEAKER_04]: It's definitely going to be interesting.

1145
01:39:54,122 --> 01:39:56,463
[SPEAKER_04]: The jury's out now for me.

1146
01:39:56,583 --> 01:40:02,866
[SPEAKER_04]: I was completely sold on Xbox 360 and I wanted to pick one up on launch day, but now I'm not so sure I want to get one on launch day.

1147
01:40:03,366 --> 01:40:07,388
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if I want to fight those crowds and stuff, so we'll see how that goes.

1148
01:40:08,289 --> 01:40:13,351
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to kind of depend on what mood I'm in that day, but after spending $70 on Guitar Hero, I don't know if I want to spend another $400 on Xbox, so we'll see.

1149
01:40:15,532 --> 01:40:23,194
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, somebody in chat room asked me very nicely if they could call in because they had a story related to what we're talking about right now.

1150
01:40:23,234 --> 01:40:24,894
[SPEAKER_04]: So I said, okay, I'll make an exception.

1151
01:40:24,934 --> 01:40:25,874
[SPEAKER_04]: So who do we have on the line?

1152
01:40:26,874 --> 01:40:28,615
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, it's Sephiroth1215 here.

1153
01:40:28,815 --> 01:40:30,135
[SPEAKER_04]: Hello, Sephiroth1215.

1154
01:40:30,175 --> 01:40:32,155
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, what did you want to say in regards to Xbox 360?

1155
01:40:33,776 --> 01:40:39,017
[SPEAKER_12]: I actually said briefly in the chat room before, but no one really responded, so I don't even know if people were paying attention.

1156
01:40:39,137 --> 01:40:44,698
[SPEAKER_04]: We're trying to stay on top of it, but we also enjoy listening to ourselves talk, so it's kind of hard to stay on top of it sometimes.

1157
01:40:44,718 --> 01:40:45,358
[SPEAKER_12]: I think I saw it.

1158
01:40:45,865 --> 01:40:46,145
[SPEAKER_12]: Go ahead.

1159
01:40:47,086 --> 01:40:51,108
[SPEAKER_12]: But yeah, I actually just went by a Toys R Us today, and I was able to reserve one.

1160
01:40:51,208 --> 01:40:52,769
[SPEAKER_12]: Guaranteed to get it in the 22nd.

1161
01:40:53,850 --> 01:40:55,390
[SPEAKER_04]: When did Toys R Us start doing reserves?

1162
01:40:55,731 --> 01:40:56,211
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the point.

1163
01:40:56,271 --> 01:40:57,472
[SPEAKER_04]: Everybody forgot about Toys R Us.

1164
01:40:57,492 --> 01:41:02,915
[SPEAKER_04]: That's why I keep saying, go to Toys R Us, go to Target, and stuff like that, because no one remembers about Toys R Us.

1165
01:41:02,935 --> 01:41:03,995
[SPEAKER_04]: But Target doesn't do reserves.

1166
01:41:04,976 --> 01:41:07,197
[SPEAKER_04]: I know, but they're going to get their games in.

1167
01:41:07,237 --> 01:41:08,838
[SPEAKER_22]: See, the systems are going to be in it at Target.

1168
01:41:09,118 --> 01:41:12,380
[SPEAKER_22]: You have to be there at 6 in the morning, and they're basically going to go out there

1169
01:41:13,398 --> 01:41:23,325
[SPEAKER_22]: it's first come first serve, the first people in line or whatever get this card that entitles them to buy the system and then they keep doing it until it's sold out and that's it

1170
01:41:25,703 --> 01:41:28,725
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki, tell me, why should I buy an Xbox 360?

1171
01:41:29,186 --> 01:41:29,426
[SPEAKER_04]: Why?

1172
01:41:30,207 --> 01:41:33,629
[SPEAKER_04]: Why do I need one in two weeks or whenever the damn thing's coming out?

1173
01:41:33,869 --> 01:41:38,873
[SPEAKER_22]: Well, personally, like me, I'm a consumer whore and I have to get it right when it comes out.

1174
01:41:38,973 --> 01:41:42,756
[SPEAKER_22]: Just mainly the reason why I want to get it so I can review this stuff right.

1175
01:41:43,317 --> 01:41:49,622
[SPEAKER_22]: Kind of try to get an edge on everything because I know we're not IGN, we're not GameSpot or anything like that.

1176
01:41:50,102 --> 01:41:53,905
[SPEAKER_22]: And so having this console now as opposed to two months from now

1177
01:41:54,577 --> 01:41:56,859
[SPEAKER_22]: It's important to me, so I need to get that stuff.

1178
01:41:57,740 --> 01:42:08,249
[SPEAKER_22]: The other thing is, also, with the date of the PlayStation 3 kind of up in the air, the next system that we know is going to launch is going to be in June, which is the revolution.

1179
01:42:08,329 --> 01:42:10,511
[SPEAKER_22]: That's, you know, almost seven months away.

1180
01:42:11,051 --> 01:42:18,037
[SPEAKER_22]: I don't want to wait seven months, so, you know, I got to do that, and also Burnout's coming out in March, so... Oh, yeah, there's the real answer.

1181
01:42:18,297 --> 01:42:19,138
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, all right.

1182
01:42:19,658 --> 01:42:22,160
[SPEAKER_04]: So, how much did they make you put down at Toys R Us for the Xbox 360?

1183
01:42:23,844 --> 01:42:27,547
[SPEAKER_12]: Only 50, but the problem is you have to get a bundle.

1184
01:42:29,108 --> 01:42:33,552
[SPEAKER_04]: So you have to get the, not the core, but the... I keep forgetting the name.

1185
01:42:33,572 --> 01:42:35,894
[SPEAKER_04]: There's core and there's... Just Xbox 360.

1186
01:42:36,314 --> 01:42:38,055
[SPEAKER_04]: The plus, the plus pack or whatever.

1187
01:42:38,075 --> 01:42:38,375
[SPEAKER_04]: Just 360.

1188
01:42:38,456 --> 01:42:45,961
[SPEAKER_12]: Hold on, I mean, of course you have to get the premium version, which is alright anyway, because that's going to be the harder one to find.

1189
01:42:46,562 --> 01:42:52,907
[SPEAKER_12]: And cores are going to be probably pretty easy, but still... Wait, are they making you get games with it too?

1190
01:42:53,939 --> 01:42:54,459
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.

1191
01:42:55,519 --> 01:42:57,200
[SPEAKER_04]: I heard a rumor about this now.

1192
01:42:57,260 --> 01:43:03,582
[SPEAKER_04]: Wasn't there something on Slash Thought about how Microsoft was like forcing retailers to make sure people walk out the door with two games or something like that?

1193
01:43:03,602 --> 01:43:15,485
[SPEAKER_22]: Well, you're going to have to because in order for them to be guaranteed to get them in, they have to guarantee that they're going to do $10 million with Microsoft in like, I want to say the next year or in the next few months.

1194
01:43:16,286 --> 01:43:20,787
[SPEAKER_22]: So $10 million, you're going to have to push those games like big time.

1195
01:43:21,109 --> 01:43:27,551
[SPEAKER_04]: I just, I, honestly, the more and more I hear, the less and less I want to support this system on the launch day, because I don't like their tactics.

1196
01:43:28,671 --> 01:43:35,753
[SPEAKER_04]: I realize it's all business, and it's just, you know, trying to make money and stuff, and trying to, you know, sell as many as they can before Christmas, but honestly, there's got to be a better way of doing it.

1197
01:43:35,773 --> 01:43:39,414
[SPEAKER_22]: The whole thing is, though, is they're trickling them out so they can say, oh yeah, it sold out on the first day.

1198
01:43:39,714 --> 01:43:44,095
[SPEAKER_22]: Well, yeah, if you put out half the amount that you're supposed to put out, of course it's going to sell out, morons.

1199
01:43:44,175 --> 01:44:11,434
[SPEAKER_04]: but the gamer community is well aware of what Microsoft's trying to play with us and the average consumer does not follow the game industry and they don't know better the average consumer is not going to be waiting at 6 o'clock in the morning out front of Target when Lil Billy wants to get his fucking Xbox 360 for Christmas you better damn well believe people are going to be waiting in line for these things they're fighting over I mean look at Tickle Me Elmo that thing is fucking retarded but people went out and bought them got in riots it's retarded but that's what it is

1200
01:44:12,615 --> 01:44:12,855
[SPEAKER_04]: and so on.

1201
01:44:30,509 --> 01:44:33,171
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, because, you know, they're really known for gaming in their PCs.

1202
01:44:33,251 --> 01:44:37,394
[SPEAKER_04]: If Apple and Nintendo teamed up, I swear to God, it would be a force to beat.

1203
01:44:37,654 --> 01:44:42,938
[SPEAKER_04]: Apple and Nintendo, if they teamed up, they're the masters of getting people to buy the same shit over.

1204
01:44:42,998 --> 01:44:44,720
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, look at what Apple just fucking did.

1205
01:44:45,020 --> 01:44:48,142
[SPEAKER_04]: They released an iPod, and then they said, no, no, no, no, you've got to have an iPod Color.

1206
01:44:48,222 --> 01:44:49,964
[SPEAKER_04]: No, no, no, no, no, you've got to have an iPod Shuffle.

1207
01:44:50,004 --> 01:44:51,024
[SPEAKER_04]: No, no, no, no, wait, an iPod Nano.

1208
01:44:51,044 --> 01:44:52,706
[SPEAKER_04]: No, no, no, no, wait, we've got one that plays videos.

1209
01:44:52,906 --> 01:44:53,847
[SPEAKER_04]: They played a Nintendo.

1210
01:44:54,327 --> 01:44:54,787
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly.

1211
01:44:55,308 --> 01:44:56,829
[SPEAKER_04]: Apple and Nintendo, a match made in heaven.

1212
01:44:57,249 --> 01:44:58,010
[SPEAKER_04]: Tell me it shouldn't happen.

1213
01:44:59,384 --> 01:44:59,785
[SPEAKER_04]: I agree.

1214
01:44:59,985 --> 01:45:00,285
[SPEAKER_04]: I should.

1215
01:45:00,605 --> 01:45:06,190
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, sorry Sephiroth, we're just making you listen to our rants there, but... That's alright.

1216
01:45:06,691 --> 01:45:09,473
[SPEAKER_12]: I think Loki's pretty much completely right on this one, though.

1217
01:45:10,454 --> 01:45:18,922
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I hate to say it, but I know Loki's right on this one, but it doesn't piss me off any less, though.

1218
01:45:19,002 --> 01:45:23,446
[SPEAKER_12]: I see what you mean, but us gamers have to get it when we can anyway, so... I know.

1219
01:45:23,567 --> 01:45:24,848
[SPEAKER_04]: Anything else you want to share with our listeners?

1220
01:45:26,572 --> 01:45:44,635
[SPEAKER_12]: Uh, yeah, I mean, I realize getting a bundle isn't too bad, because even with the games that it's coming with, it's three games, and I could just go back to another Toys R Us, or go to a Walmart and return for credit without a receipt, so it's not too bad.

1221
01:45:44,735 --> 01:45:45,655
[SPEAKER_04]: Now that's thinking.

1222
01:45:45,996 --> 01:45:47,076
[SPEAKER_04]: I like the way this guy thinks.

1223
01:45:47,136 --> 01:45:47,756
[SPEAKER_04]: Smart idea.

1224
01:45:47,796 --> 01:45:52,757
[SPEAKER_04]: If you don't want to have to buy these, forced to buy these games or whatever, then just buy them and take them back to another store.

1225
01:45:53,057 --> 01:45:53,777
[SPEAKER_04]: Beautiful idea.

1226
01:45:53,837 --> 01:45:54,257
[SPEAKER_04]: I like it.

1227
01:45:56,072 --> 01:45:56,372
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1228
01:45:57,112 --> 01:45:58,493
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, thank you so much for calling in.

1229
01:45:58,533 --> 01:46:03,615
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to try and get past this topic soon enough, but we appreciate your perspective and letting us know about Toys R Us.

1230
01:46:03,655 --> 01:46:05,696
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a good FYI.

1231
01:46:05,736 --> 01:46:08,757
[SPEAKER_04]: And somebody in chat suggested Circuit City, which I think is another good idea.

1232
01:46:08,957 --> 01:46:10,318
[SPEAKER_04]: Everybody forgets about Circuit City.

1233
01:46:10,778 --> 01:46:14,660
[SPEAKER_22]: And also, there's some other places that you would never think to book a 360, that one being Kohl's.

1234
01:46:18,061 --> 01:46:22,064
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't even know Kohl's carried electronics, let alone having 360s.

1235
01:46:22,504 --> 01:46:23,625
[SPEAKER_04]: Kohl's is one of them.

1236
01:46:24,366 --> 01:46:26,968
[SPEAKER_22]: Also, like I mentioned before, Target and Best Buy.

1237
01:46:27,028 --> 01:46:35,054
[SPEAKER_22]: Best Buy they're saying is going to have a lot more because apparently Bill Gates is going to be whoring the Xbox 360 out at one of the Best Buys in Manhattan.

1238
01:46:35,074 --> 01:46:36,655
[SPEAKER_22]: That's the rumor, at least.

1239
01:46:36,795 --> 01:46:41,599
[SPEAKER_04]: And because of that, there's a deal now where they're going to be getting a larger allocation over everybody else.

1240
01:46:42,239 --> 01:46:44,340
[SPEAKER_04]: Suckin' Microsoft's Cock for more Xboxes.

1241
01:46:44,440 --> 01:46:44,861
[SPEAKER_04]: Beautiful.

1242
01:46:45,721 --> 01:46:53,406
[SPEAKER_04]: And, um, basically, yeah, just a lot of these, you know, sores that everybody forgets about, just go check them and see if you can get a 360 there.

1243
01:46:53,766 --> 01:46:54,727
[SPEAKER_04]: Fucking Kohl's?

1244
01:46:55,007 --> 01:46:55,347
[SPEAKER_04]: Kohl's.

1245
01:46:55,427 --> 01:46:59,810
[SPEAKER_04]: I can walk out of there with, um, an Xbox 360 and new... And a hoe!

1246
01:46:59,970 --> 01:47:00,931
[SPEAKER_04]: And new underwear.

1247
01:47:04,553 --> 01:47:04,893
[SPEAKER_13]: And a hoe.

1248
01:47:04,913 --> 01:47:07,475
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, for when I soil my pants at Dead or Alive 4.

1249
01:47:07,975 --> 01:47:08,536
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, anything else?

1250
01:47:09,465 --> 01:47:14,967
[SPEAKER_12]: But honestly, yeah, it will be possible to get one by this launch day, I'm sure, if you just try hard enough.

1251
01:47:15,067 --> 01:47:16,288
[SPEAKER_12]: It's not too hard.

1252
01:47:17,028 --> 01:47:25,152
[SPEAKER_12]: So, I mean, if people rush out the Toys R Us, like, tomorrow, I'm sure you might be able to get one, a reserve, but there's still going to be limited quantities.

1253
01:47:26,232 --> 01:47:34,781
[SPEAKER_12]: and also I say don't listen to the people at EB or GameStop because all they ever tell me is, no, you can't go anywhere else.

1254
01:47:35,282 --> 01:47:46,273
[SPEAKER_12]: And I took off my money from my reserve at EB today and they laughed at me saying you're not going to be able to get it because I guess they're told that the only reserve for them and the only way you're going to be able to get it is through them.

1255
01:47:47,154 --> 01:47:48,715
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for watching!

1256
01:48:16,030 --> 01:48:18,753
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, anyway, appreciate that call there.

1257
01:48:18,973 --> 01:48:21,435
[SPEAKER_04]: Got us on a little bit of a rant about Xbox 360.

1258
01:48:22,036 --> 01:48:25,379
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, this I think is really interesting, and Loki, I saw you had this up earlier.

1259
01:48:25,419 --> 01:48:32,086
[SPEAKER_04]: Can you go back to 1up.com and their story about the, oh, you already had it, great, the Xbox 360 versus the Dreamcast?

1260
01:48:32,266 --> 01:48:32,366
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

1261
01:48:32,406 --> 01:48:39,212
[SPEAKER_04]: I think this article is so hilarious where they compare the Dreamcast, which, you know, Dreamcast...

1262
01:48:40,240 --> 01:48:45,869
[SPEAKER_04]: It didn't succeed, but it wasn't because it was a bad system, because Dreamcast actually had a lot of good stuff on it.

1263
01:48:46,249 --> 01:48:51,257
[SPEAKER_04]: Phantasy Star Online was revolutionary, and the little... What was the thingy called?

1264
01:48:51,277 --> 01:48:51,858
[SPEAKER_04]: The VMU?

1265
01:48:52,258 --> 01:48:54,081
[SPEAKER_04]: That could have its own games on it?

1266
01:48:54,622 --> 01:48:55,644
[SPEAKER_04]: That stuff was revolutionary.

1267
01:48:56,024 --> 01:48:57,945
[SPEAKER_04]: But unfortunately, the Dreamcast didn't succeed.

1268
01:48:58,205 --> 01:49:02,087
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's interesting to see them drawing comparisons to the Dreamcast and the Xbox 360.

1269
01:49:02,487 --> 01:49:03,987
[SPEAKER_04]: So this article is over on 1up.com.

1270
01:49:04,247 --> 01:49:07,309
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki, read us like five or so comparisons here between Dreamcast and 360.

1271
01:49:08,309 --> 01:49:11,631
[SPEAKER_04]: Launched the year before the competition, and that's the same on both.

1272
01:49:11,831 --> 01:49:12,831
[SPEAKER_22]: Okay.

1273
01:49:13,391 --> 01:49:14,112
[SPEAKER_22]: Let's see here.

1274
01:49:14,832 --> 01:49:18,974
[SPEAKER_04]: Had a sleek white console following the footsteps of a bulky black console.

1275
01:49:19,614 --> 01:49:22,095
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, technicality though, my Xbox is green.

1276
01:49:23,172 --> 01:49:23,853
[SPEAKER_04]: The Little Swirly

1277
01:49:44,176 --> 01:49:44,776
[SPEAKER_22]: That's creepy.

1278
01:49:45,397 --> 01:49:46,077
[SPEAKER_22]: Let's see here.

1279
01:49:46,997 --> 01:49:52,680
[SPEAKER_22]: We've also got Promise to be an evolutionary system to someday play DVDs.

1280
01:49:52,760 --> 01:49:57,002
[SPEAKER_22]: It says, Promise to be an evolutionary system someday to play HD DVDs.

1281
01:49:57,883 --> 01:49:58,223
[SPEAKER_04]: Interesting.

1282
01:49:58,383 --> 01:50:02,845
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, Dreamcast did end up supporting DVDs eventually, didn't they?

1283
01:50:03,045 --> 01:50:03,605
[SPEAKER_04]: No, they never did.

1284
01:50:03,905 --> 01:50:04,486
[SPEAKER_04]: No, they never did?

1285
01:50:04,526 --> 01:50:05,306
[SPEAKER_04]: You know why I'm confusing it?

1286
01:50:05,326 --> 01:50:06,347
[SPEAKER_04]: Because you could play VCDs.

1287
01:50:06,367 --> 01:50:08,187
[SPEAKER_04]: You could download things from the internet to play VCDs.

1288
01:50:08,608 --> 01:50:09,208
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm confusing it.

1289
01:50:09,508 --> 01:50:16,077
[SPEAKER_22]: And then, of course, one of my favorites is, for the Dreamcast, Metal Gear Solid 2 trailer stole much of its next generation thunder.

1290
01:50:16,477 --> 01:50:21,384
[SPEAKER_22]: And then for the Xbox 360, Metal Gear Solid 4 trailer stole much of its next generation thunder.

1291
01:50:22,438 --> 01:50:23,678
[SPEAKER_04]: It'll be interesting to see what happens.

1292
01:50:24,099 --> 01:50:41,784
[SPEAKER_04]: But then they go into another, now there's a spin-off article, now it's not all, you know, they're not trying to say Xbox 360 is going to definitely, you know, fade away like the Dreamcast did, but they do say that there's things that the Xbox 360 has going for it that the Dreamcast did not.

1293
01:50:42,484 --> 01:50:46,105
[SPEAKER_04]: There's like a sequel to the article also on the site, so check those out.

1294
01:50:46,125 --> 01:50:47,466
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a whole, a lot of stuff that...

1295
01:50:48,755 --> 01:50:59,883
[SPEAKER_22]: You know, personally, it's just the people that are going to be buying it aren't smart enough to, like, say, okay, Microsoft, you know, you're really holding back your allocations, you know, that's kind of pissing me off, I'm going to go buy something else.

1296
01:51:00,444 --> 01:51:01,224
[SPEAKER_22]: People aren't going to do that.

1297
01:51:01,244 --> 01:51:04,046
[SPEAKER_22]: They're just going to be like, well, I'm going to wait, you know, or something.

1298
01:51:04,086 --> 01:51:06,288
[SPEAKER_22]: Because it's the first system next gen that's coming out.

1299
01:51:07,373 --> 01:51:10,415
[SPEAKER_22]: The system is only as good as the games on it.

1300
01:51:34,042 --> 01:51:36,544
[SPEAKER_22]: Xbox 360, though, has some pretty good games on it.

1301
01:51:37,185 --> 01:51:48,755
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm most excited... I will give them a lot... They're launching better this time because they actually have something on it that is not a fighting, a driving, or sports title on it.

1302
01:51:49,015 --> 01:51:58,643
[SPEAKER_04]: They have, you know, like Cameo, and they have some other, you know, interesting titles around launch, the Elder Scrolls and stuff, so it's nice to see variety in their launch titles this time.

1303
01:51:58,843 --> 01:51:59,664
[SPEAKER_22]: No, no, no.

1304
01:51:59,884 --> 01:52:00,525
[SPEAKER_22]: They have Cameo.

1305
01:52:02,369 --> 01:52:07,973
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, on the actual launch day they have cameo, but they have Elder Scrolls, you know, not that far out, right?

1306
01:52:08,073 --> 01:52:08,353
[SPEAKER_04]: April.

1307
01:52:08,893 --> 01:52:11,235
[SPEAKER_04]: And then King Kong is a little bit different, too.

1308
01:52:11,635 --> 01:52:12,095
[SPEAKER_04]: Give it that.

1309
01:52:12,195 --> 01:52:16,978
[SPEAKER_22]: It's a first-person shooter still, sort of.

1310
01:52:16,998 --> 01:52:22,562
[SPEAKER_22]: It's not much of a... Okay, well, anyways, yeah, so they're coming out with some more stuff later.

1311
01:52:23,396 --> 01:52:23,696
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1312
01:52:24,096 --> 01:52:25,036
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to go to a break, guys.

1313
01:52:25,056 --> 01:52:28,317
[SPEAKER_04]: When we come back from this break, the long promised, we said we were going to do it all night.

1314
01:52:28,337 --> 01:52:29,917
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to get to it listless.

1315
01:52:29,937 --> 01:52:31,097
[SPEAKER_04]: We haven't done this segment in a long time.

1316
01:52:31,257 --> 01:52:32,878
[SPEAKER_03]: You said we were going to do it all night.

1317
01:52:33,458 --> 01:52:34,558
[SPEAKER_03]: Do it all night.

1318
01:52:35,038 --> 01:52:37,558
[SPEAKER_04]: No, we're not going to hear that song in this break because I don't want to hear Erotic tonight.

1319
01:52:39,019 --> 01:52:40,319
[SPEAKER_04]: But I do want to hear this request.

1320
01:52:41,039 --> 01:52:41,279
[SPEAKER_04]: Angel?

1321
01:52:43,059 --> 01:52:44,640
[SPEAKER_07]: You don't want to listen to Erotic tonight?

1322
01:52:44,840 --> 01:52:45,080
[SPEAKER_07]: What?

1323
01:52:46,180 --> 01:52:46,640
[SPEAKER_04]: I told you.

1324
01:52:46,720 --> 01:52:47,300
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm in a mood.

1325
01:52:47,340 --> 01:52:48,620
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm in this emo mood tonight.

1326
01:52:48,660 --> 01:52:49,340
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know what it is.

1327
01:52:50,161 --> 01:52:52,001
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, then go scare them with emo or something.

1328
01:52:52,878 --> 01:52:59,542
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, no, I'm actually going to be a good co-host, and I'm going to play a request that somebody requested in our chat room.

1329
01:52:59,562 --> 01:53:00,743
[SPEAKER_04]: And that was for some Captain Jack.

1330
01:53:01,224 --> 01:53:03,005
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're going to do some Captain Jack starting off this break.

1331
01:53:03,305 --> 01:53:07,648
[SPEAKER_04]: And we'll be back with tonight's list list regarding Guitar Hero 2, hypothetically.

1332
01:53:07,808 --> 01:53:09,809
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course, it hasn't been announced yet, but come on.

1333
01:53:10,590 --> 01:53:11,030
[SPEAKER_04]: Come on.

1334
01:53:11,430 --> 01:53:13,452
[SPEAKER_04]: All they have to do is make their money back, and there'll be a Guitar Hero 2.

1335
01:53:13,492 --> 01:53:14,232
[SPEAKER_04]: There's got to be one.

1336
01:53:14,252 --> 01:53:15,513
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, we'll be back after this.

1337
01:53:15,533 --> 01:53:18,375
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll start it off with some Captain Jack fifth mix style, yo.

1338
01:54:42,296 --> 01:54:43,396
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you for watching!

1339
01:55:38,161 --> 01:55:39,192
Thanks for watching!

1340
02:00:06,820 --> 02:00:26,405
[SPEAKER_15]: Welcome back boys and girls to Orange Lounge Radio and I bet you kids are dying to know who won tonight's cage match because we had the votes tallied.

1341
02:00:27,366 --> 02:00:28,826
[SPEAKER_04]: So, tonight's winner...

1342
02:00:29,773 --> 02:00:32,974
[SPEAKER_04]: It was a very, very, very close vote, by the way.

1343
02:00:33,054 --> 02:00:34,835
[SPEAKER_04]: Like all three songs, neck and neck and neck.

1344
02:00:35,335 --> 02:00:39,417
[SPEAKER_04]: In fact, tonight's vote was so close, we have a tie.

1345
02:00:39,777 --> 02:00:41,418
[SPEAKER_04]: A tie in tonight's cage match.

1346
02:00:41,958 --> 02:00:43,479
[SPEAKER_04]: So here are the songs that are tied.

1347
02:00:43,519 --> 02:00:49,282
[SPEAKER_04]: The first song that's tied tonight is... Depeche Mode with Precious.

1348
02:00:51,583 --> 02:00:54,344
[SPEAKER_04]: And the second song that is tied tonight is...

1349
02:00:58,533 --> 02:01:01,715
[SPEAKER_04]: Nine Inch Nails with Old Wings.

1350
02:01:02,195 --> 02:01:04,676
[SPEAKER_04]: So apparently the chatroom is feeling very emo too.

1351
02:01:04,956 --> 02:01:08,918
[SPEAKER_04]: Although there were quite a few votes for song number two, just not enough unfortunately.

1352
02:01:09,298 --> 02:01:15,582
[SPEAKER_04]: So going to the cage match rulebook, the way we break a tie, the host who picked the song that did not tie gets to break the vote.

1353
02:01:15,662 --> 02:01:17,382
[SPEAKER_04]: So Loki, which song's gonna win?

1354
02:01:17,482 --> 02:01:17,983
[SPEAKER_04]: Depeche Mode.

1355
02:01:18,383 --> 02:01:20,624
[SPEAKER_04]: Depeche Mode wins tonight's cage match.

1356
02:01:21,424 --> 02:01:23,105
[SPEAKER_04]: Any particular reason why you went for that one?

1357
02:01:23,586 --> 02:01:24,766
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know, I just like Depeche Mode.

1358
02:01:25,767 --> 02:01:26,167
[SPEAKER_04]: Fair enough.

1359
02:01:27,313 --> 02:01:29,355
[SPEAKER_04]: It was the most emo of the two.

1360
02:01:30,676 --> 02:01:31,816
[SPEAKER_04]: You mean most emo-ist?

1361
02:01:32,677 --> 02:01:33,017
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

1362
02:01:33,358 --> 02:01:37,381
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what next week I'm wrapping up.

1363
02:01:37,401 --> 02:01:37,961
[SPEAKER_04]: Mamma Mia?

1364
02:01:38,561 --> 02:01:38,722
[SPEAKER_07]: No.

1365
02:01:39,082 --> 02:01:39,822
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, can't wait.

1366
02:01:40,103 --> 02:01:42,865
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually, no, I won't be here next week, so yeah, Mamma Mia will be in the cage match.

1367
02:01:43,430 --> 02:01:46,353
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, in two weeks we'll look forward to it.

1368
02:01:46,473 --> 02:01:47,294
[SPEAKER_04]: I won't even be here.

1369
02:01:48,515 --> 02:01:49,236
[SPEAKER_04]: Living it up!

1370
02:01:49,616 --> 02:01:53,060
[SPEAKER_04]: You're going to be at the, well, the Gay Frat House doesn't exist anymore.

1371
02:01:53,140 --> 02:01:54,301
[SPEAKER_07]: The Gay Frat House is gone.

1372
02:01:54,441 --> 02:01:55,001
[SPEAKER_04]: That's too bad.

1373
02:01:55,902 --> 02:01:57,364
[SPEAKER_07]: I will be living it up in SoCal.

1374
02:01:58,825 --> 02:02:04,030
[SPEAKER_07]: Where my harem of adoring math players will be waiting for me.

1375
02:02:04,050 --> 02:02:04,771
[SPEAKER_22]: This is next week?

1376
02:02:05,972 --> 02:02:07,474
[SPEAKER_22]: Are you going to go see Harry Potter down there?

1377
02:02:11,236 --> 02:02:13,737
[SPEAKER_07]: I thought it was the week after, how dare you?

1378
02:02:13,757 --> 02:02:14,337
[SPEAKER_04]: Make my heart stop

1379
02:02:33,200 --> 02:02:37,662
[SPEAKER_07]: Speaking of which, I have nobody to go with because, um... You can come with us.

1380
02:02:37,962 --> 02:02:39,863
[SPEAKER_07]: Temagus doesn't like Harry Potter.

1381
02:02:39,883 --> 02:02:41,224
[SPEAKER_07]: You can come with us and screw him.

1382
02:02:42,064 --> 02:02:42,444
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

1383
02:02:42,864 --> 02:02:44,385
[SPEAKER_07]: Anybody want to come kidnap me?

1384
02:02:45,365 --> 02:02:47,847
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't, like, literally screw him, but, you know.

1385
02:02:48,987 --> 02:02:51,748
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh, I don't do that anyway, you sicko.

1386
02:02:51,768 --> 02:02:53,549
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, anyway.

1387
02:02:54,350 --> 02:02:58,852
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, no, but DarkSakura's going to be gone next week for a legitimate business purpose, right?

1388
02:02:58,872 --> 02:02:59,692
[SPEAKER_04]: Tell them where you're going to be.

1389
02:02:59,712 --> 02:03:00,952
[SPEAKER_07]: To meet my adoring fans!

1390
02:03:01,193 --> 02:03:01,673
[SPEAKER_04]: Where at?

1391
02:03:02,702 --> 02:03:04,643
[SPEAKER_07]: at the Podcast Awards, alright?

1392
02:03:04,764 --> 02:03:07,125
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura's gonna be representing us at the Podcast Awards.

1393
02:03:07,165 --> 02:03:10,748
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to be there in all of my, in all of my, uh, dark glory.

1394
02:03:11,428 --> 02:03:14,270
[SPEAKER_22]: I didn't go because he wouldn't give me any, like, time on the mic.

1395
02:03:14,290 --> 02:03:23,257
[SPEAKER_04]: He'd be like, thank you for, and then I would just, and then Loki would get to go up there and go, it's so much fun, and then get cut off.

1396
02:03:24,278 --> 02:03:25,518
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to say, give me a dollar!

1397
02:03:25,558 --> 02:03:26,779
[SPEAKER_07]: And he goes sit down.

1398
02:03:47,355 --> 02:03:48,956
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't embarrass us, DarkSakura.

1399
02:03:50,117 --> 02:03:50,817
[SPEAKER_07]: I never do.

1400
02:03:51,317 --> 02:03:53,038
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a fair representation of the show.

1401
02:03:53,118 --> 02:03:55,180
[SPEAKER_07]: Could you please thank my mother while you're down there?

1402
02:03:56,180 --> 02:03:57,501
[SPEAKER_07]: I thank your mother.

1403
02:04:00,022 --> 02:04:01,983
[SPEAKER_07]: I'd like to thank your mom.

1404
02:04:03,804 --> 02:04:04,145
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1405
02:04:04,705 --> 02:04:08,307
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to get into tonight's list very shortly, but I do want to give a little bit of a reminder.

1406
02:04:08,407 --> 02:04:10,248
[SPEAKER_04]: Ultramix 3, right around the corner.

1407
02:04:10,628 --> 02:04:12,349
[SPEAKER_04]: Ultramix 3's got a damn impressive lineup.

1408
02:04:12,369 --> 02:04:13,810
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that out this Tuesday, I think?

1409
02:04:13,910 --> 02:04:14,331
[SPEAKER_04]: Next week.

1410
02:04:14,411 --> 02:04:14,791
[SPEAKER_04]: Next week?

1411
02:04:15,855 --> 02:04:18,618
[SPEAKER_02]: I heard it was leaking early, I don't know.

1412
02:04:20,359 --> 02:04:23,882
[SPEAKER_07]: I swear to God, again I'm going to go broke before my birthday, right Rob?

1413
02:04:24,443 --> 02:04:31,689
[SPEAKER_22]: You also have that same week, Flow, the Urban Dance Uprising, in case you feel a little bit like a breakbeat mood and you have the extra money to waste on stuff.

1414
02:04:31,749 --> 02:04:39,155
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, like I said, Ultramix 3 is coming out, and I know a lot of you guys are going to buy Ultramix 3, and you wouldn't want to buy any other dancing game except Ultramix 3 that day.

1415
02:04:41,317 --> 02:04:41,677
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1416
02:04:42,518 --> 02:04:44,460
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I wanted to mention something about DDR and Mario, too.

1417
02:04:44,500 --> 02:04:45,661
[SPEAKER_04]: I keep putting off the list list.

1418
02:04:45,681 --> 02:04:49,865
[SPEAKER_04]: But DDR and Mario, there's been tournaments going on, like, everywhere.

1419
02:04:49,925 --> 02:04:51,306
[SPEAKER_04]: There was actually one here in Sacramento.

1420
02:04:51,326 --> 02:04:52,207
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if you guys heard of this.

1421
02:04:52,727 --> 02:04:53,368
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't go.

1422
02:04:53,468 --> 02:04:56,350
[SPEAKER_04]: However, I heard that a whopping five people entered the tournament.

1423
02:04:56,891 --> 02:04:59,834
[SPEAKER_04]: So congratulations to whoever won out of those five people.

1424
02:04:59,854 --> 02:05:00,354
[SPEAKER_04]: Was it?

1425
02:05:00,374 --> 02:05:01,955
[SPEAKER_04]: A free copy of Mario DDR.

1426
02:05:01,996 --> 02:05:02,716
[SPEAKER_04]: Was it Andrew?

1427
02:05:03,277 --> 02:05:03,697
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

1428
02:05:03,837 --> 02:05:04,958
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I don't think it was him that won.

1429
02:05:04,978 --> 02:05:05,639
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it was somebody else.

1430
02:05:07,256 --> 02:05:09,181
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know who won, but I know who posted about it.

1431
02:05:11,305 --> 02:05:12,147
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh, yeah, explicit.

1432
02:05:12,248 --> 02:05:12,909
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway, yeah.

1433
02:05:13,851 --> 02:05:14,453
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know who won.

1434
02:05:14,834 --> 02:05:15,675
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll have to find out from him.

1435
02:05:17,014 --> 02:05:22,158
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sure they did a fabulous job and earned their Mario DDR, which is a game I don't think I'm going to buy.

1436
02:05:22,699 --> 02:05:25,161
[SPEAKER_04]: Honestly, I'm not feeling the Mario DDR.

1437
02:05:25,181 --> 02:05:29,484
[SPEAKER_04]: I love Nintendo, I love DDR, but I'm not feeling the Mario DDR.

1438
02:05:30,625 --> 02:05:31,886
[SPEAKER_04]: I know it would last five minutes.

1439
02:05:32,286 --> 02:05:34,088
[SPEAKER_04]: The honeymoon would be over before it begins.

1440
02:05:34,868 --> 02:05:37,631
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, well, you know what you have to steal your money instead?

1441
02:05:38,331 --> 02:05:38,812
[SPEAKER_04]: Mario Party 7.

1442
02:05:40,083 --> 02:05:45,266
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, I'll go with that, because I love playing Mario Party 7, because I'm an evil bitch when I play as Peach in that game.

1443
02:05:45,606 --> 02:05:46,707
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm a vindictive motherfucker.

1444
02:05:46,727 --> 02:05:51,490
[SPEAKER_04]: They need DS Mario Party, so we can get some Wi-Fi going.

1445
02:05:51,510 --> 02:05:54,492
[SPEAKER_04]: I heard that was a rumor, something that was in development, was the DS Mario Party.

1446
02:05:55,352 --> 02:05:56,033
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll see, though, we'll see.

1447
02:05:56,053 --> 02:06:00,356
[SPEAKER_04]: Because think about all the mini-games, because the mini-games are starting to get a little stale, but think about all the new stuff they could do with the pen.

1448
02:06:00,776 --> 02:06:00,936
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

1449
02:06:00,956 --> 02:06:01,416
[SPEAKER_04]: It'd be fun.

1450
02:06:02,857 --> 02:06:05,179
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, let's get into tonight's listless.

1451
02:06:06,820 --> 02:06:07,280
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1452
02:06:08,928 --> 02:06:21,358
[SPEAKER_04]: The way that Listless works, because it's been a hell of a long time since we've done one of these segments, what we're going to do is each of us here in studio, so it would be the three hosts, myself, DarkSakura, and Loki, and then our special guest, Angel, because Bug left.

1453
02:06:21,398 --> 02:06:22,819
[SPEAKER_04]: He decided to go watch Family Guy or something.

1454
02:06:23,880 --> 02:06:26,181
[SPEAKER_04]: We're each going to put in three...

1455
02:06:27,122 --> 02:06:28,603
[SPEAKER_04]: Subtitles by Subtitle Workshop

1456
02:06:42,790 --> 02:06:46,632
[SPEAKER_04]: And then we come up through this highly scientific process we call listless of the top three songs we want to see in Guitar Hero 2.

1457
02:07:04,577 --> 02:07:04,837
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1458
02:07:05,558 --> 02:07:07,158
[SPEAKER_04]: So that being said, let's start it off.

1459
02:07:07,218 --> 02:07:07,999
[SPEAKER_04]: Everybody ready to go?

1460
02:07:08,039 --> 02:07:08,859
[SPEAKER_04]: Got their three songs?

1461
02:07:09,059 --> 02:07:10,040
[SPEAKER_02]: There we go.

1462
02:07:10,240 --> 02:07:10,500
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1463
02:07:10,640 --> 02:07:12,561
[SPEAKER_04]: Angel, you're lowest on the totem pole.

1464
02:07:12,681 --> 02:07:13,482
[SPEAKER_04]: You start us off.

1465
02:07:15,082 --> 02:07:15,703
[SPEAKER_29]: Just messing with you.

1466
02:07:15,723 --> 02:07:18,544
[SPEAKER_29]: What's your number three pick?

1467
02:07:22,746 --> 02:07:23,847
[SPEAKER_07]: Anything from Dragon Force.

1468
02:07:24,667 --> 02:07:25,468
[SPEAKER_07]: You guys are like, huh?

1469
02:07:27,837 --> 02:07:30,119
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, Dragon Force is like a metal band.

1470
02:07:30,900 --> 02:07:32,001
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know what it is.

1471
02:07:32,041 --> 02:07:33,663
[SPEAKER_07]: I think they're from like Norway or something.

1472
02:07:33,823 --> 02:07:34,644
[SPEAKER_07]: Go ahead.

1473
02:07:35,725 --> 02:07:37,747
[SPEAKER_07]: As Rob opens, oh, never mind.

1474
02:07:38,247 --> 02:07:39,708
[SPEAKER_07]: As Rob types in stuff.

1475
02:07:40,829 --> 02:07:42,771
[SPEAKER_07]: I thought it was like going on to Google or something.

1476
02:07:43,232 --> 02:07:43,932
[SPEAKER_04]: Give me a song.

1477
02:07:43,972 --> 02:07:45,474
[SPEAKER_04]: Give me any song that Dragon Force did.

1478
02:07:48,021 --> 02:07:48,643
[SPEAKER_07]: I forgot.

1479
02:07:48,984 --> 02:07:49,986
[SPEAKER_07]: Praise something.

1480
02:07:50,026 --> 02:07:50,387
[SPEAKER_07]: Whatever.

1481
02:07:50,487 --> 02:07:50,808
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway.

1482
02:07:51,109 --> 02:07:53,674
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like some of their new ones that nobody knows about yet.

1483
02:07:54,055 --> 02:07:54,777
[SPEAKER_07]: It's the first song.

1484
02:07:55,298 --> 02:07:57,042
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, somebody wanna google that?

1485
02:07:57,062 --> 02:07:57,623
[SPEAKER_07]: Go ahead.

1486
02:07:58,553 --> 02:08:01,355
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, anything by Dragon Force, first thing on tonight's list.

1487
02:08:01,856 --> 02:08:03,417
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll go over, I'll go next.

1488
02:08:03,837 --> 02:08:09,742
[SPEAKER_04]: My number three pick for tonight's list list is the song Bitch by Meredith Brooks.

1489
02:08:10,143 --> 02:08:12,565
[SPEAKER_04]: And I don't know if you remember this song from the 90s, it was kind of a one-hit wonder.

1490
02:08:13,085 --> 02:08:13,866
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm a bitch.

1491
02:08:14,506 --> 02:08:23,133
[SPEAKER_04]: I actually met this woman once, she was really nice, and she actually is a really good guitar player, and that's something people never really picked up about her, but she's inspired by Hendrix and all those people.

1492
02:08:23,373 --> 02:08:26,376
[SPEAKER_04]: She's a really good guitar player, and I just want to play Bitch.

1493
02:08:26,736 --> 02:08:27,957
[SPEAKER_04]: on Guitar Hero, that would rock.

1494
02:08:28,017 --> 02:08:30,359
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's my pick for number three song.

1495
02:08:30,699 --> 02:08:31,079
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki.

1496
02:08:32,440 --> 02:08:36,863
[SPEAKER_04]: My number three song is going to be Kenny Loggins with Danger Zone.

1497
02:08:38,424 --> 02:08:43,327
[SPEAKER_04]: That song, granted, it's really cheesy and stuff, but it's really a good guitar song.

1498
02:08:45,289 --> 02:08:46,990
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that the same one from Top Gun?

1499
02:08:47,010 --> 02:08:49,251
[SPEAKER_22]: Yep, that would be the same one from Top Gun.

1500
02:08:49,652 --> 02:08:52,093
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, DarkSakura, that's the queen of the show, you get to go last.

1501
02:08:52,814 --> 02:08:55,616
[SPEAKER_07]: Number three, ACDC, Highway to Hell.

1502
02:09:00,487 --> 02:09:01,908
[SPEAKER_04]: I am throwing up the horns as we speak.

1503
02:09:02,108 --> 02:09:03,289
[SPEAKER_04]: Now we're fucking talking.

1504
02:09:03,369 --> 02:09:04,270
[SPEAKER_04]: Highway to Hell.

1505
02:09:06,571 --> 02:09:17,238
[SPEAKER_04]: Although I can't fucking stand that guy's voice.

1506
02:09:18,199 --> 02:09:19,240
[SPEAKER_04]: I love the guitar.

1507
02:09:19,780 --> 02:09:21,921
[SPEAKER_04]: So that would be a badass song to play in Guitar Hero.

1508
02:09:21,961 --> 02:09:22,862
[SPEAKER_04]: I definitely support you.

1509
02:09:22,882 --> 02:09:24,623
[SPEAKER_04]: I will not take that off the list, I guarantee you.

1510
02:09:25,044 --> 02:09:27,065
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, let's go around to the number two picks.

1511
02:09:28,806 --> 02:09:29,947
[SPEAKER_04]: Angel, what's your number two pick?

1512
02:09:31,087 --> 02:09:37,668
[SPEAKER_07]: Pearl Jam, uh, either, oh hell, okay fine, Alive.

1513
02:09:40,969 --> 02:09:48,330
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a good band to have in Guitar Hero, Pearl Jam, we kind of missed them in the last one, so okay, Alive by Pearl Jam, Angel's number two pick, good pick.

1514
02:09:48,610 --> 02:09:49,631
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki, what's your number two pick?

1515
02:09:50,551 --> 02:09:56,052
[SPEAKER_22]: Um, my number two pick, what was it, toss up, um, Filter with Hey Man Nice Shot.

1516
02:09:56,632 --> 02:09:57,132
[SPEAKER_21]: Alright.

1517
02:10:04,304 --> 02:10:07,126
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it true that that song's about some guy that killed himself or something?

1518
02:10:07,146 --> 02:10:07,806
[SPEAKER_04]: I have no idea.

1519
02:10:08,567 --> 02:10:09,827
[SPEAKER_07]: Eh, Curcumin?

1520
02:10:11,328 --> 02:10:12,709
[SPEAKER_04]: No, that's tasteless.

1521
02:10:13,770 --> 02:10:14,550
[SPEAKER_07]: I shit you not.

1522
02:10:16,011 --> 02:10:17,452
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow, alright.

1523
02:10:17,532 --> 02:10:24,896
[SPEAKER_04]: My number two pick, my number two pick for a song that should be in Guitar Hero 2 would be Are You Gonna Go My Way by Lenny Kravitz.

1524
02:10:25,537 --> 02:10:28,158
[SPEAKER_04]: Because that song's badass and it has a great guitar riff in it.

1525
02:10:28,178 --> 02:10:29,339
[SPEAKER_13]: Are you gonna go my way?

1526
02:10:29,679 --> 02:10:30,760
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm gonna do that.

1527
02:10:30,800 --> 02:10:32,121
[SPEAKER_04]: Are You Gonna Go My Way by Lenny Kravitz.

1528
02:10:35,151 --> 02:10:36,592
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, your number two pick.

1529
02:10:37,953 --> 02:10:40,514
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going... God damn this stupid thing.

1530
02:10:42,716 --> 02:10:51,241
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to have to go with Metallica, and I've had a hard time narrowing it down, because there's just a whole bunch of fucking good Metallica songs.

1531
02:10:51,942 --> 02:11:02,909
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'd have to say... Yeah, actually, I'm going to have to go with Master of Puppets.

1532
02:11:03,314 --> 02:11:04,154
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, thank you.

1533
02:11:04,194 --> 02:11:06,935
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm glad you changed your mind at the last minute and decided not to do a newer song.

1534
02:11:06,955 --> 02:11:09,415
[SPEAKER_04]: So Master of Puppets by Metallica.

1535
02:11:13,556 --> 02:11:14,096
[SPEAKER_04]: Badass.

1536
02:11:14,136 --> 02:11:15,316
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm liking this list so far.

1537
02:11:15,336 --> 02:11:16,436
[SPEAKER_04]: We got some good shit on here.

1538
02:11:16,456 --> 02:11:17,777
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to rock out on Guitar Hero 2.

1539
02:11:18,077 --> 02:11:19,257
[SPEAKER_04]: I hope Red Octane's listening.

1540
02:11:20,797 --> 02:11:26,198
[SPEAKER_04]: Angel, your number one pick for song you most want to see in fucking Guitar Hero 2.

1541
02:11:27,738 --> 02:11:29,339
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to scare you guys with this one.

1542
02:11:30,979 --> 02:11:31,979
[SPEAKER_07]: Rainbow with Stargazer.

1543
02:11:33,985 --> 02:11:35,866
[SPEAKER_07]: Just cause like the guitar in that's pretty cool.

1544
02:11:36,026 --> 02:11:37,787
[SPEAKER_07]: I have a massive question mark over my head.

1545
02:11:38,887 --> 02:11:39,188
[SPEAKER_07]: Really?

1546
02:11:39,728 --> 02:11:40,468
[SPEAKER_07]: Richie Blackmore.

1547
02:11:40,608 --> 02:11:42,569
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway, yeah, 1976, you don't want to know.

1548
02:11:43,610 --> 02:11:46,431
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, some classic stuff, some old classic stuff.

1549
02:11:47,111 --> 02:11:48,672
[SPEAKER_04]: Stargazer by Rainbow.

1550
02:11:48,912 --> 02:11:54,575
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, Loki, your number one pick for song that oughta damn well better be in Guitar Hero 2.

1551
02:11:55,195 --> 02:11:56,976
[SPEAKER_22]: Soundgarden with Black Hole Sun.

1552
02:12:02,546 --> 02:12:03,289
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice pick.

1553
02:12:03,330 --> 02:12:05,619
[SPEAKER_04]: Black Hole Sun by Soundgarden.

1554
02:12:05,680 --> 02:12:06,242
[SPEAKER_04]: Good pick.

1555
02:12:08,549 --> 02:12:09,930
[SPEAKER_04]: Spoonman would be good too.

1556
02:12:10,630 --> 02:12:13,551
[SPEAKER_04]: If we could have had the video too, because that's one of my favorite videos of all time.

1557
02:12:13,671 --> 02:12:14,972
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, who doesn't love the Black Hole Sun video?

1558
02:12:14,992 --> 02:12:21,374
[SPEAKER_04]: That'd be great, you know, if they could do it where they play the video in the background of the stage while they're doing the song.

1559
02:12:21,394 --> 02:12:23,255
[SPEAKER_04]: Like on a big monitor.

1560
02:12:23,415 --> 02:12:24,556
[SPEAKER_04]: In Amplitude they did that.

1561
02:12:24,816 --> 02:12:25,276
[SPEAKER_04]: I remember.

1562
02:12:25,476 --> 02:12:27,697
[SPEAKER_04]: You could see the Blink-182 video in that one song.

1563
02:12:27,737 --> 02:12:28,017
[SPEAKER_04]: Cool.

1564
02:12:28,517 --> 02:12:36,520
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, my number one pick for song I would most want to see in Guitar Hero 2 would be More Human Than Human by White Zombie.

1565
02:12:36,841 --> 02:12:37,421
[SPEAKER_07]: Shit, yeah.

1566
02:12:41,112 --> 02:12:44,095
[SPEAKER_04]: I love that song, so we're gonna do More Human Than Human by White Zombie.

1567
02:12:45,376 --> 02:12:46,857
[SPEAKER_29]: DarkSakura, your number one pick.

1568
02:12:48,219 --> 02:12:50,961
[SPEAKER_07]: It was a really tough thing for me to think of.

1569
02:12:51,261 --> 02:12:53,784
[SPEAKER_07]: However, I'm gonna go with Blur's song too.

1570
02:12:53,804 --> 02:12:55,886
[SPEAKER_07]: The Woohoo one.

1571
02:12:56,246 --> 02:12:58,188
[SPEAKER_07]: For the people who only know it as the Woohoo song.

1572
02:12:58,648 --> 02:13:01,791
[SPEAKER_04]: I knew that Blur or Gorillaz would be on your list somewhere.

1573
02:13:01,811 --> 02:13:03,533
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a good choice.

1574
02:13:03,573 --> 02:13:05,475
[SPEAKER_07]: It doesn't matter, there's no other way.

1575
02:13:06,215 --> 02:13:11,078
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, but I think more people, of course, more people know, you know, woohoo, everybody knows that one, so.

1576
02:13:11,759 --> 02:13:12,659
[SPEAKER_07]: Am I allowed to kill one?

1577
02:13:14,380 --> 02:13:16,042
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I mean, yes.

1578
02:13:16,342 --> 02:13:17,563
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, what?

1579
02:13:17,723 --> 02:13:25,708
[SPEAKER_07]: Change Dragonforce, I can't believe I said that, but change Dragonforce to Foo Fighters Everlong.

1580
02:13:25,768 --> 02:13:27,269
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, that's a good one.

1581
02:13:30,563 --> 02:13:33,206
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, so here's the list as it stands so far.

1582
02:13:33,666 --> 02:13:51,486
[SPEAKER_04]: Everlong by Foo Fighters, Bitch by Meredith Brooks, Danger Zone by Kenny Loggins, Highway to Hell by ACDC, Alive by Pearl Jam, Hey Man Nice Shot by Filter, Are You Gonna Go My Way by Lenny Kravitz, Master of Puppets by Metallica, Stargazer by Rainbow,

1583
02:13:51,826 --> 02:13:57,832
[SPEAKER_04]: Black Hole Sun by Soundgarden, More Human Than Human by White Zombie, Song 2 by Blur.

1584
02:13:58,012 --> 02:13:58,392
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what?

1585
02:13:58,432 --> 02:13:58,653
[SPEAKER_04]: Fuck.

1586
02:13:58,693 --> 02:14:00,434
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's just send this to Red Octane and say this is what we want.

1587
02:14:00,514 --> 02:14:01,615
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, this is a great list right here.

1588
02:14:02,356 --> 02:14:03,197
[SPEAKER_04]: This is an awesome list.

1589
02:14:03,557 --> 02:14:10,304
[SPEAKER_07]: I do think that our top three, we actually should say, hey, all of the listeners of Orange Lounge Radio voted and want these songs in the next game.

1590
02:14:10,484 --> 02:14:11,905
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what's interesting about this list, though?

1591
02:14:12,265 --> 02:14:13,206
[SPEAKER_04]: No Nirvana.

1592
02:14:13,627 --> 02:14:14,768
[SPEAKER_04]: We have Foo Fighters.

1593
02:14:14,908 --> 02:14:15,829
[SPEAKER_04]: I was thinking it.

1594
02:14:17,675 --> 02:14:18,655
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, Roz mentioned it.

1595
02:14:18,756 --> 02:14:21,837
[SPEAKER_07]: I almost put it in with, uh, Whitesnake, Here I Go Again.

1596
02:14:22,197 --> 02:14:23,317
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, so many good songs.

1597
02:14:23,457 --> 02:14:23,737
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

1598
02:14:23,977 --> 02:14:26,258
[SPEAKER_04]: This can only be the beginning of many great songs.

1599
02:14:26,278 --> 02:14:27,459
[SPEAKER_04]: There's many, many great songs.

1600
02:14:27,619 --> 02:14:30,980
[SPEAKER_04]: Obviously, we missed some big ones, but these are the ones that are near and dear to our heart.

1601
02:14:31,460 --> 02:14:40,303
[SPEAKER_04]: If this is gonna be tough, I know I say this every week, that it's gonna be tough to eliminate songs from the list, but tonight especially, this one is gonna suck, because this is a really good list, but we have to do it.

1602
02:14:40,723 --> 02:14:41,664
[SPEAKER_04]: It's part of the game.

1603
02:14:42,284 --> 02:14:43,224
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's start taking them off.

1604
02:14:43,344 --> 02:14:43,604
[SPEAKER_04]: Angel.

1605
02:14:44,725 --> 02:14:45,105
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, no.

1606
02:14:47,827 --> 02:14:53,311
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just gonna have to take off Bitch.

1607
02:14:53,331 --> 02:14:55,332
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just not as rocking as the rest of them.

1608
02:15:13,829 --> 02:15:15,750
[SPEAKER_04]: I wasn't too attached to that song being there.

1609
02:15:15,790 --> 02:15:17,051
[SPEAKER_04]: I just kind of had to throw that in there.

1610
02:15:17,071 --> 02:15:17,992
[SPEAKER_04]: Because, you know, I'm a bitch.

1611
02:15:18,172 --> 02:15:18,652
[SPEAKER_04]: I would have.

1612
02:15:18,692 --> 02:15:21,695
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, so, my turn to take something off.

1613
02:15:23,203 --> 02:15:29,228
[SPEAKER_04]: This is tough, and I apologize, but I kinda got the question mark with this song, too, and maybe it's just because I'm uncultured.

1614
02:15:29,288 --> 02:15:32,250
[SPEAKER_04]: I have to take Stargazer by Rainbow off the list.

1615
02:15:32,330 --> 02:15:33,851
[SPEAKER_04]: I just, I'm sorry, Angel.

1616
02:15:33,871 --> 02:15:36,093
[SPEAKER_07]: No, that's fine.

1617
02:15:36,373 --> 02:15:43,719
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, I can send you the song later, and you're probably gonna, like, kill yourself later, because you'll be like, ah, why did I take that off?

1618
02:15:44,179 --> 02:15:45,620
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1619
02:16:14,773 --> 02:16:17,396
[SPEAKER_07]: D&D Psy, Everlong

1620
02:16:35,863 --> 02:16:54,160
[SPEAKER_04]: We have Highway to Hell by ACDC, Alive by Pearl Jam, Hey Man Nice Shot by Filter, Are You Gonna Go My Way by Lenny Kravitz, Master of Puppets by Metallica, Black Hole Sun by Soundgarden, More Human Than Human by White Zombie, and Song 2 by Blur.

1621
02:16:54,521 --> 02:16:58,324
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, send a private message to Sky with your vote.

1622
02:16:58,665 --> 02:17:00,006
[SPEAKER_07]: And no bleached assholes!

1623
02:17:02,247 --> 02:17:03,328
[SPEAKER_04]: You guys are fucked up.

1624
02:17:03,788 --> 02:17:04,368
[SPEAKER_04]: Seriously.

1625
02:17:05,149 --> 02:17:05,929
[SPEAKER_04]: Seriously fucked.

1626
02:17:05,949 --> 02:17:07,630
[SPEAKER_07]: We have your roommate to blame for that, you know.

1627
02:17:07,850 --> 02:17:08,150
[SPEAKER_07]: I know.

1628
02:17:08,711 --> 02:17:09,791
[SPEAKER_07]: Bleached asshole.

1629
02:17:09,952 --> 02:17:10,172
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

1630
02:17:10,552 --> 02:17:14,754
[SPEAKER_04]: So we will reveal the definitive list a little later in the program.

1631
02:17:15,015 --> 02:17:21,939
[SPEAKER_07]: And I will personally throw up on the doorstep of Red Octane if they ever put Korn or Slipknot in it.

1632
02:17:22,759 --> 02:17:25,340
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, Korn, I could deal with.

1633
02:17:25,420 --> 02:17:29,601
[SPEAKER_04]: Korn's pretty cool until, like, until they hit MTV, Korn was very cool.

1634
02:17:29,661 --> 02:17:32,742
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, Adidas, you know, All Day I Dream About... That was a cool song.

1635
02:17:33,122 --> 02:17:38,144
[SPEAKER_04]: But, you know, when they kind of, you know, started being on MTV all the time, I didn't dig them so much.

1636
02:17:38,544 --> 02:17:40,165
[SPEAKER_04]: But, no, Slipknot.

1637
02:17:40,245 --> 02:17:40,805
[SPEAKER_04]: No, please, no.

1638
02:17:41,165 --> 02:17:41,665
[SPEAKER_04]: Please, God, no.

1639
02:17:42,145 --> 02:17:43,886
[SPEAKER_04]: However, Gwar would be awesome.

1640
02:17:45,066 --> 02:17:46,426
[SPEAKER_07]: No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1641
02:17:46,547 --> 02:17:47,027
[SPEAKER_04]: Primus.

1642
02:17:48,107 --> 02:17:49,788
[SPEAKER_04]: See, all these... Winona's a big down beaver.

1643
02:17:50,388 --> 02:17:50,968
[SPEAKER_04]: Winona's...

1644
02:17:52,179 --> 02:17:54,040
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh my god, I forgot about that song.

1645
02:17:54,440 --> 02:17:55,441
[SPEAKER_04]: That song was badass.

1646
02:17:55,521 --> 02:17:56,021
[SPEAKER_07]: No, no, no.

1647
02:17:56,061 --> 02:17:59,483
[SPEAKER_07]: My ex-boyfriend in Alabama was like the world's biggest Primus fan.

1648
02:18:00,403 --> 02:18:09,728
[SPEAKER_07]: So we would go down his Civic MRX, play in Primus at like downtown Mobile and all the old people would wake up.

1649
02:18:09,928 --> 02:18:11,589
[SPEAKER_04]: Or just the theme song to South Park.

1650
02:18:14,429 --> 02:18:15,129
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, anyway.

1651
02:18:15,470 --> 02:18:18,391
[SPEAKER_04]: So those votes are coming in there into the chat right now.

1652
02:18:18,991 --> 02:18:20,272
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's talk a little bit real quick.

1653
02:18:20,292 --> 02:18:23,433
[SPEAKER_04]: We are going to take a quick break so we can allow all the votes to come in.

1654
02:18:23,453 --> 02:18:28,075
[SPEAKER_04]: However, I want to definitely plug some of the spin-off programming here on Orange Lounge Radio.

1655
02:18:28,555 --> 02:18:31,477
[SPEAKER_04]: And we'll start it off with Monday nights on the station.

1656
02:18:32,137 --> 02:18:33,618
[SPEAKER_04]: Extifer, who's not here tonight.

1657
02:18:33,638 --> 02:18:35,138
[SPEAKER_04]: He's spending some quality family time.

1658
02:18:35,198 --> 02:18:36,819
[SPEAKER_04]: His sister's over, and I think they're watching a movie.

1659
02:18:37,179 --> 02:18:38,880
[SPEAKER_04]: So Extifer has his show on Monday nights.

1660
02:18:38,920 --> 02:18:40,300
[SPEAKER_04]: It's Extifer's Case of the Mondays.

1661
02:18:40,821 --> 02:18:40,921
[SPEAKER_04]: And...

1662
02:18:41,641 --> 02:18:47,646
[SPEAKER_04]: It'll definitely clear up any Monday blahs that you were having with his very frank and honest talk.

1663
02:18:47,946 --> 02:18:51,809
[SPEAKER_04]: And last week on the show, he had John on the show last week.

1664
02:18:51,849 --> 02:18:56,393
[SPEAKER_04]: And John has nothing... John doesn't even play games, really, although I did catch him playing Final Fantasy VI once.

1665
02:18:56,713 --> 02:19:01,597
[SPEAKER_04]: But, you know, it's the show where they kind of talk about games, but they talk about cool stuff, too.

1666
02:19:01,657 --> 02:19:05,701
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you just want to have a good time, Monday nights on the station is extra first case of the Mondays.

1667
02:19:05,981 --> 02:19:08,263
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, Tuesday nights is also a very good time.

1668
02:19:08,303 --> 02:19:09,204
[SPEAKER_04]: Why is that, DarkSakura?

1669
02:19:10,246 --> 02:19:13,687
[SPEAKER_07]: DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1670
02:19:39,807 --> 02:19:41,088
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1671
02:20:03,862 --> 02:20:06,103
[SPEAKER_04]: I read Fark's stories and Dig's stories too, okay?

1672
02:20:06,323 --> 02:20:07,244
[SPEAKER_04]: Give me some credit.

1673
02:20:09,265 --> 02:20:10,025
[SPEAKER_04]: But no, we have a good time.

1674
02:20:10,705 --> 02:20:11,265
[SPEAKER_04]: I like my show.

1675
02:20:11,445 --> 02:20:11,745
[SPEAKER_04]: It's fun.

1676
02:20:12,166 --> 02:20:14,987
[SPEAKER_04]: So tune in Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday nights here on Orange Lounge Radio.

1677
02:20:15,347 --> 02:20:17,468
[SPEAKER_04]: Thursdays and Fridays to come soon?

1678
02:20:18,168 --> 02:20:18,988
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe.

1679
02:20:19,408 --> 02:20:19,949
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll see.

1680
02:20:20,509 --> 02:20:21,389
[SPEAKER_03]: So, alright.

1681
02:20:21,969 --> 02:20:22,450
[SPEAKER_03]: Any little comments?

1682
02:20:24,650 --> 02:20:26,131
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh, maybe.

1683
02:20:27,111 --> 02:20:27,672
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe.

1684
02:20:27,712 --> 02:20:28,332
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll see what happens.

1685
02:20:29,514 --> 02:20:38,658
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, so while we're finishing getting your votes, we would start the FUs of the week normally, but I don't want both those things to overlap each other with the private messages.

1686
02:20:38,698 --> 02:20:39,598
[SPEAKER_04]: I can only handle so much.

1687
02:20:39,878 --> 02:20:48,902
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're going to do a quick break, and then we're going to come back, reveal the winners of tonight's list list, and, so get those votes in now, and we're going to move into the FUs of the week, because I know y'all are angsty.

1688
02:20:49,382 --> 02:20:56,845
[SPEAKER_04]: And DarkSakura has a new theme song for her FUs tonight, and I'll tell you what, it's probably the best damn FU theme song yet, I think.

1689
02:20:57,185 --> 02:20:58,446
[SPEAKER_07]: It is, I forgot what I picked.

1690
02:20:59,639 --> 02:21:01,440
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, you'll find out when we get back.

1691
02:21:02,380 --> 02:21:04,000
[SPEAKER_04]: Or if you're nice, I'll tell you during the break.

1692
02:21:06,741 --> 02:21:07,842
[SPEAKER_04]: So we'll be back after this.

1693
02:21:08,702 --> 02:21:14,524
[SPEAKER_04]: In this break, I think what we're going to do is... You know, I had some people requesting this, even though we played it on last week's show.

1694
02:21:15,224 --> 02:21:16,764
[SPEAKER_04]: This song is just so cool.

1695
02:21:16,964 --> 02:21:19,285
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know how you can not like this song.

1696
02:21:19,705 --> 02:21:21,606
[SPEAKER_04]: So we have to give it its due.

1697
02:21:22,386 --> 02:21:26,527
[SPEAKER_04]: And I apologize, though, because... Oh, shit.

1698
02:21:26,588 --> 02:21:27,868
[SPEAKER_04]: If I can find it... Uh-oh.

1699
02:21:29,738 --> 02:21:33,119
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll try to get to it during the break at some point.

1700
02:21:33,500 --> 02:21:34,420
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't find it all of a sudden.

1701
02:21:34,440 --> 02:21:35,720
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll be back.

1702
02:21:37,161 --> 02:21:38,101
[SPEAKER_04]: How embarrassing is that?

1703
02:21:38,201 --> 02:21:38,462
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, well.

1704
02:21:39,142 --> 02:21:42,283
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll try and get to that song, but in the meantime, you get some other songs.

1705
02:21:43,644 --> 02:21:50,006
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll start it off with something from Ultramix 2, because we haven't played a lot of newer stuff tonight.

1706
02:21:50,567 --> 02:21:54,128
[SPEAKER_04]: So we'll do an Ultramix 2 song, and we'll be back after this.

1707
02:21:54,148 --> 02:21:56,129
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to start it off with Toe Jam.

1708
02:21:57,609 --> 02:21:58,830
[SPEAKER_04]: You're listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

1709
02:22:02,708 --> 02:22:03,649

Thanks for watching!

1712
02:24:02,008 --> 02:24:06,593
[SPEAKER_04]: This is not dead air, it's just that this song has a very quiet opening, so you'll just have to deal with it a little bit.

1713
02:24:35,669 --> 02:24:36,610
[SPEAKER_14]: Thanks for watching!

1714
02:24:48,059 --> 02:25:03,809
[SPEAKER_14]: Old New York was once New Amsterdam Why they changed it I can't say People just liked it better that way So take me back to Constantinople No you can't go back to Constantinople Been a long time gone Constantinople, why did Constantinople get the works?

1715
02:25:04,309 --> 02:25:06,451
[SPEAKER_14]: That's what it is about the church

1716
02:25:24,833 --> 02:25:32,940
[SPEAKER_14]: Old New York was once New Amsterdam Why they changed it, I can't say You just liked it better that way!

1717
02:25:33,040 --> 02:25:40,566
[SPEAKER_14]: Istanbul was Constantinople, now it's Istanbul My Constantinople got a long time gone But Constantinople, why did Constantinople get the works?

1718
02:25:41,046 --> 02:25:43,849
[SPEAKER_14]: That's nobody's business but the Turks

1719
02:26:09,367 --> 02:26:17,293
[SPEAKER_14]: So take me back to Constantinople No you can't go back to Constantinople Been a long time gone to Constantinople Why did Constantinople get the works?

1720
02:26:17,773 --> 02:26:19,555
[SPEAKER_14]: That's nobody's business but the church

02:26:31,539 --> 02:26:32,620
[SPEAKER_15]: Thanks for watching!

1722
02:27:26,397 --> 02:27:27,558
Thanks for watching!

1723
02:28:16,753 --> 02:28:20,917
[SPEAKER_20]: Let's listen in on an Orange Lounge Radio staff meeting.

1724
02:28:21,137 --> 02:28:22,839
[SPEAKER_13]: Do we want to be staffed by Hollywood?

1725
02:28:22,899 --> 02:28:23,259
[SPEAKER_13]: No!

1726
02:28:23,360 --> 02:28:27,043
[SPEAKER_13]: Do we care what people think of us?

1727
02:28:27,664 --> 02:28:29,506
[SPEAKER_13]: No!

1728
02:28:29,526 --> 02:28:30,967
[SPEAKER_13]: Do we want people to kiss our ass?

1729
02:28:31,427 --> 02:28:34,350
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes!

1730
02:28:35,511 --> 02:28:37,393
[SPEAKER_20]: Extreme Bomani Radio.

1731
02:28:37,593 --> 02:28:38,234
[SPEAKER_20]: That's us.

02:28:38,775 --> 02:28:40,316
[SPEAKER_20]: Orange Lounge Radio.

1733
02:28:43,970 --> 02:28:45,812
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, we're back in the list list.

1734
02:28:45,992 --> 02:28:54,599
[SPEAKER_04]: We're about to reveal the definitive list as voted by you, the chatroom of the three songs you most want to see in Guitar Hero 2.

1735
02:28:54,659 --> 02:28:56,500
[SPEAKER_04]: You guys ready for this?

1736
02:28:57,181 --> 02:28:57,981
[SPEAKER_04]: What do you think won?

1737
02:28:58,001 --> 02:28:58,381
[SPEAKER_04]: Any early guesses?

1738
02:29:06,588 --> 02:29:07,448
[SPEAKER_04]: Apathetic people.

1739
02:29:08,289 --> 02:29:09,469
[SPEAKER_04]: No Bleached Asshole Son?

1740
02:29:09,549 --> 02:29:10,529
[SPEAKER_04]: Bleached Asshole Son.

1741
02:29:10,549 --> 02:29:10,970
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll see.

1742
02:29:11,690 --> 02:29:12,210
[SPEAKER_04]: Here we go.

1743
02:29:12,350 --> 02:29:13,231
[SPEAKER_04]: Number three.

1744
02:29:13,271 --> 02:29:16,832
[SPEAKER_04]: The number three pick you guys want to see in Guitar Hero 2.

1745
02:29:17,432 --> 02:29:19,913
[SPEAKER_04]: Highway to Hell by ACDC.

1746
02:29:20,053 --> 02:29:20,654
[SPEAKER_15]: Rock!

1747
02:29:22,134 --> 02:29:25,196
[SPEAKER_04]: The number two song you most want to see in Listless.

1748
02:29:25,976 --> 02:29:27,897
[SPEAKER_04]: Song 2 by Blurred.

1749
02:29:27,917 --> 02:29:28,237
[SPEAKER_04]: Woohoo!

1750
02:29:30,396 --> 02:29:41,204
[SPEAKER_04]: and then, yeah, literally, and the number one song you bitches wanna see in Guitar Hero 2 by a landslide, might I add, by a freaking landslide vote, Master of Puppets by Metallica.

1751
02:29:41,305 --> 02:29:44,207
[SPEAKER_07]: I have the best taste in the whole freaking room.

1752
02:29:44,227 --> 02:29:45,348
[SPEAKER_04]: I knew that would happen.

1753
02:29:46,348 --> 02:29:50,852
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, by the way, all three on the list, yeah, those were all three of Jamie's picks.

1754
02:29:51,112 --> 02:29:51,733
[SPEAKER_15]: Woo!

1755
02:29:52,253 --> 02:29:54,675
[SPEAKER_04]: I bet the rest of us are wishing we knocked some of them out, huh?

1756
02:29:56,156 --> 02:29:56,516
[SPEAKER_04]: Bitch.

1757
02:29:56,737 --> 02:29:58,338
[SPEAKER_07]: Mine is an evil laugh.

1758
02:30:01,394 --> 02:30:03,536
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what's funny is that it was in a different order.

1759
02:30:04,377 --> 02:30:05,739
[SPEAKER_04]: So don't get too cocky over there.

1760
02:30:05,799 --> 02:30:07,421
[SPEAKER_07]: Just only two songs were turned around.

1761
02:30:07,441 --> 02:30:12,146
[SPEAKER_07]: This is because not everybody appreciates Blur the way I do.

1762
02:30:15,290 --> 02:30:21,577
[SPEAKER_04]: Some other votes though too, you know, Are You Gonna Go My Way was a very, it was like a fourth, so you know, it wasn't all, it wasn't all Jamie.

1763
02:30:24,045 --> 02:30:26,086
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, you changed your theme song yet again.

1764
02:30:37,813 --> 02:30:39,153
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1765
02:31:13,277 --> 02:31:14,658
[SPEAKER_15]: Murder!

1766
02:31:18,280 --> 02:31:20,781
[SPEAKER_07]: Ah, this makes me feel mighty.

1767
02:31:22,081 --> 02:31:26,204
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, my first FU goes toward migraines.

1768
02:31:26,924 --> 02:31:27,944
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, migraines.

1769
02:31:28,345 --> 02:31:32,607
[SPEAKER_07]: Because it means that my brain is broken and they want me to go in for a CT scan.

1770
02:31:34,423 --> 02:31:44,707
[SPEAKER_07]: An FU goes to the stuff they gave me to help with the slow, horrible migraines because, well, it makes me lightheaded and feel like I'm drunk without being drunk.

1771
02:31:45,227 --> 02:31:48,208
[SPEAKER_07]: If I'm gonna feel drunk, I'll let the benefit of booze to feel drunk.

1772
02:31:51,670 --> 02:31:52,170
[SPEAKER_07]: God.

1773
02:31:55,171 --> 02:32:02,854
[SPEAKER_07]: An FU goes toward idiot drivers and people who decide to pull into my lane facing toward me.

1774
02:32:04,370 --> 02:32:15,603
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, and Effie goes toward, uh, the McDonald's over here by Rob's house for being rather dumb.

1775
02:32:15,623 --> 02:32:17,626
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what's funny is all three of us went there tonight.

1776
02:32:17,706 --> 02:32:18,507
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that's hilarious.

1777
02:32:18,787 --> 02:32:21,450
[SPEAKER_07]: And Effie to the ghetto family in front of me, because they really like ghetto.

1778
02:32:21,510 --> 02:32:21,570
[SPEAKER_07]: Um...

1779
02:32:26,164 --> 02:32:28,807
[SPEAKER_07]: A nephew toward me not having much time to do stuff.

1780
02:32:28,907 --> 02:32:32,351
[SPEAKER_07]: Also a nephew to me not having the whole week to procrastinate on my homework.

1781
02:32:32,892 --> 02:32:39,720
[SPEAKER_07]: So I have to do homework tonight, homework Monday, homework Wednesday, and get it all done before I leave Thursday.

1782
02:32:41,542 --> 02:32:43,224
[SPEAKER_07]: But that means I get to enjoy myself all weekend.

1783
02:32:44,246 --> 02:32:47,007
[SPEAKER_07]: An FU in Advance Tour to Grapevine before you get to L.A.

1784
02:32:47,027 --> 02:32:49,648
[SPEAKER_07]: because that road is like crap.

1785
02:32:50,228 --> 02:32:52,509
[SPEAKER_07]: And there'll probably be a forest fire or something stupid.

1786
02:32:53,249 --> 02:32:55,810
[SPEAKER_07]: As there always is every time I go to L.A.

1787
02:32:56,751 --> 02:32:58,932
[SPEAKER_07]: And then an FU to L.A.

1788
02:33:00,132 --> 02:33:02,033
[SPEAKER_07]: freeway system in general because it sucks.

1789
02:33:03,553 --> 02:33:07,835
[SPEAKER_07]: And the floating pockets of yellow smog that seem to be sentient.

1790
02:33:09,993 --> 02:33:15,037
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, and an F you goes to my nose for draining into my throat, and I probably will have their guidance tomorrow.

1791
02:33:15,257 --> 02:33:16,518
[SPEAKER_07]: Just thought I'd let everyone know.

1792
02:33:16,538 --> 02:33:18,059
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, I'm done.

1793
02:33:19,340 --> 02:33:20,501
[SPEAKER_22]: Alright, Loki.

1794
02:33:23,244 --> 02:33:28,868
[SPEAKER_22]: Anyways, um, first fuck you, McDonald's, for not being able to fill an order correctly.

1795
02:33:29,713 --> 02:33:31,635
[SPEAKER_22]: I asked them for a two-cheeseburger meal.

1796
02:33:31,755 --> 02:33:42,363
[SPEAKER_22]: Granted, I know that's not on their menu still, but it's still something that they offer, because I get it almost every day, at least every day this week, at the McDonald's that's by my house.

1797
02:33:42,763 --> 02:33:43,964
[SPEAKER_22]: Fat Fatty McFatty.

1798
02:33:44,625 --> 02:33:52,251
[SPEAKER_22]: Instead, they gave me this two McChicken meal thing, or two McChicken sandwiches and, like,

1799
02:33:53,092 --> 02:34:17,090
[SPEAKER_22]: a medium fry and stuff, I'm like, um, no, this is not what I ordered, oh, well, we thought, we don't have a two cheeseburger meal, I'm like, well, where'd you get this two fucking McChicken thing, I don't even see McChicken on their fucking, maybe you should take the hint, that they're retarded, no, that's why I went back there and got my, my, uh, food, yeah, anyways, um, fuck you, the stupid people that are driving out there, it has,

1800
02:34:18,001 --> 02:34:23,482
[SPEAKER_22]: I swear to God, you know, we're on the road today, and I see this dumb bitch, you know, she's kind of swerving in her lane.

1801
02:34:23,782 --> 02:34:28,483
[SPEAKER_04]: It's because she's doing her fucking makeup and talking on a cell phone while driving on the freeway!

1802
02:34:29,343 --> 02:34:30,283
[SPEAKER_04]: Dumb bitch!

1803
02:34:30,303 --> 02:34:31,384
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what, that takes talent.

1804
02:34:31,424 --> 02:34:34,244
[SPEAKER_04]: To do your makeup and talk on the cell phone and drive?

1805
02:34:34,964 --> 02:34:35,665
[SPEAKER_04]: That's amazing.

1806
02:34:36,685 --> 02:34:37,825
[SPEAKER_04]: She should have her hands cut off.

1807
02:34:37,845 --> 02:34:42,666
[SPEAKER_22]: Back to the Babylonian days, all of a sudden.

1808
02:34:42,806 --> 02:34:45,106
[SPEAKER_22]: Also, fuck you to Saw 2 for not being gory enough.

1809
02:34:45,847 --> 02:34:47,787
[SPEAKER_22]: It was a very, you know, huge disappointment.

1810
02:34:48,459 --> 02:34:49,980
[SPEAKER_22]: We passed for making movies.

1811
02:34:50,000 --> 02:34:50,361
[SPEAKER_04]: Forget it.

1812
02:34:51,481 --> 02:34:51,681
[SPEAKER_24]: What?

1813
02:34:52,682 --> 02:34:52,902
[SPEAKER_04]: What?

1814
02:34:52,942 --> 02:34:53,223
[SPEAKER_04]: Gory.

1815
02:34:53,263 --> 02:34:55,064
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't want to give it away.

1816
02:34:55,104 --> 02:34:56,485
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't even see it, but I read all about it.

1817
02:34:56,665 --> 02:34:58,747
[SPEAKER_04]: It sounded gross.

1818
02:35:00,008 --> 02:35:00,348
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyways.

1819
02:35:00,368 --> 02:35:01,429
[SPEAKER_04]: The opening sounded gross.

1820
02:35:02,209 --> 02:35:03,190
[SPEAKER_04]: It wasn't gross.

1821
02:35:05,432 --> 02:35:06,673
[SPEAKER_22]: It didn't show anything.

1822
02:35:07,453 --> 02:35:07,793
[SPEAKER_03]: Whatever.

1823
02:35:09,655 --> 02:35:10,055
[SPEAKER_22]: Anywho.

1824
02:35:11,776 --> 02:35:12,657
[SPEAKER_22]: So, fuck that.

1825
02:35:12,997 --> 02:35:13,357
[SPEAKER_22]: And then...

1826
02:35:15,523 --> 02:35:31,917
[SPEAKER_22]: You know, fuck you Microsoft for potentially not allowing me to have a 360 on launch day, even though I pre-ordered mine way in advance and I have purchased games as well, um, that will be coming soon, so you know what, I will damn well, I better get my system, or heads will roll.

1827
02:35:32,437 --> 02:35:32,657
[SPEAKER_04]: So.

1828
02:35:34,218 --> 02:35:34,519
[SPEAKER_04]: That's it.

1829
02:35:35,019 --> 02:35:38,382
[SPEAKER_04]: Heads will roll.

1830
02:35:38,402 --> 02:35:40,444
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, um, my FU time.

1831
02:35:44,127 --> 02:35:44,387
[SPEAKER_04]: Whoops.

1832
02:35:45,103 --> 02:35:46,404
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry, I'm supposed to make it loud.

1833
02:35:48,085 --> 02:35:49,186
[SPEAKER_04]: Ah, not that song, my song.

1834
02:35:50,387 --> 02:35:52,268
[SPEAKER_04]: There we go.

1835
02:35:52,528 --> 02:35:53,629
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't want no short dick man.

1836
02:35:53,649 --> 02:35:53,969
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

1837
02:35:54,750 --> 02:35:56,251
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, my FU's of the week.

1838
02:35:57,312 --> 02:35:59,033
[SPEAKER_04]: FU to the fact that I feel like I'm getting sick.

1839
02:35:59,053 --> 02:36:01,915
[SPEAKER_04]: Progressively throughout tonight's show, I felt my nose get more and more stuffy.

1840
02:36:02,535 --> 02:36:06,278
[SPEAKER_04]: And a sore throat, which is not good when you're supposed to be talking for eight hours a day in front of people.

1841
02:36:06,298 --> 02:36:07,038
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh-oh.

1842
02:36:07,199 --> 02:36:08,980
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm gonna be fucked come next week.

1843
02:36:09,080 --> 02:36:11,462
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a good thing I'm not in class tomorrow, otherwise I would cry.

1844
02:36:12,363 --> 02:36:13,224
[SPEAKER_04]: but I get tomorrow off.

1845
02:36:13,704 --> 02:36:20,732
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm making a stop by somewhere and getting coldies because coldies, the zinc brigade begins now.

1846
02:36:21,866 --> 02:36:27,588
[SPEAKER_07]: Boomer, do not do more than 100 milligrams in a day or you can get zinc poisoning.

1847
02:36:27,768 --> 02:36:32,889
[SPEAKER_04]: I know, I just, I'll keep it, that's gotta be like 10 of those drops though to get 100 milligrams.

1848
02:36:33,509 --> 02:36:40,931
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, an F you to World of Warcraft for being all laggy, so I have to go buy more RAM, so either I'm getting an Xbox 360 or I'm getting more RAM.

1849
02:36:41,571 --> 02:36:43,952
[SPEAKER_04]: But World of Warcraft is very pretty, I have to give it that.

1850
02:36:44,352 --> 02:36:45,352
[SPEAKER_04]: My cameo wasn't that pretty.

1851
02:36:45,572 --> 02:36:46,352
More RAM.

1852
02:36:46,993 --> 02:36:47,753
[SPEAKER_04]: Get more RAM.

1853
02:36:49,478 --> 02:36:50,298
[SPEAKER_04]: For my World of Warcraft.

1854
02:36:51,459 --> 02:36:53,341
[SPEAKER_04]: You're actually supporting my World of Warcraft addiction?

1855
02:36:54,522 --> 02:36:56,483
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess, but RAM's good for everything.

1856
02:36:57,544 --> 02:36:59,025
[SPEAKER_04]: It might be a benefit to show, too.

1857
02:36:59,386 --> 02:37:04,370
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm having problems on the Rob Roberts show with the program I'm using, and I think it's because of a lack of RAM.

1858
02:37:04,670 --> 02:37:05,191
[SPEAKER_04]: RAM's good.

1859
02:37:05,431 --> 02:37:06,211
[SPEAKER_04]: RAM is very good.

1860
02:37:06,692 --> 02:37:07,172
[SPEAKER_04]: I like RAM.

1861
02:37:07,192 --> 02:37:08,253
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess that's enough.

1862
02:37:08,313 --> 02:37:11,576
[SPEAKER_04]: F you to flu shots.

1863
02:37:15,677 --> 02:37:18,679
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I miss them at my work, but not that I would get one anyway.

1864
02:37:18,719 --> 02:37:20,861
[SPEAKER_04]: They swear up and down that flu shots do not make you sick.

1865
02:37:21,121 --> 02:37:22,742
[SPEAKER_04]: I get sick every time I have a flu shot.

1866
02:37:23,082 --> 02:37:24,023
[SPEAKER_04]: I know, it's total bullshit.

1867
02:37:24,103 --> 02:37:25,684
[SPEAKER_04]: I always get sick whenever I get a flu shot.

1868
02:37:26,785 --> 02:37:28,125
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't care what the doctor says.

1869
02:37:28,145 --> 02:37:29,226
[SPEAKER_04]: That's time out for me.

1870
02:37:29,406 --> 02:37:32,869
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I get some time off work with a legitimate excuse.

1871
02:37:34,390 --> 02:37:36,571
[SPEAKER_04]: If I'm not at work, it's an epidemic.

1872
02:37:37,112 --> 02:37:39,093
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I don't mean to talk myself up, but damn.

1873
02:37:39,733 --> 02:37:40,334
[SPEAKER_04]: I have to be there.

1874
02:37:41,595 --> 02:37:44,116
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, let's move on to Angels FU of the Week.

1875
02:37:44,457 --> 02:37:44,597
[SPEAKER_04]: And...

1876
02:37:48,001 --> 02:37:49,241
[SPEAKER_07]: Well now hypothetically you could be bi.

1877
02:38:13,926 --> 02:38:15,547
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just kidding, I don't care.

1878
02:38:16,428 --> 02:38:17,829
[SPEAKER_07]: I can't fire you, damn it!

1879
02:38:19,450 --> 02:38:42,226
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, yeah, so, um, screw you because, um, no, I'm not, and neither are my friends, and neither are the two other people that were there with me that are also serving on this board, so you need to go find somebody, something else to do, rather, and, or get kicked out of the game, because I can get you to do that now, so bye!

1880
02:38:43,147 --> 02:38:46,612
[SPEAKER_07]: And, um, FQ'd on having my computer break again, because that sucks.

1881
02:38:47,453 --> 02:38:48,996
[SPEAKER_07]: Eh, I have to go fix that tonight.

1882
02:38:49,616 --> 02:38:52,881
[SPEAKER_07]: Ah, other than that, I think I'm done.

1883
02:38:54,563 --> 02:38:59,671
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, let's go to the chatroom FUs and see what angst we have going on in chat tonight.

1884
02:39:01,445 --> 02:39:06,910
[SPEAKER_04]: Nintendomaniac64 says, F you to Sky for not mentioning the pop vs soda argument like you said you would.

1885
02:39:07,950 --> 02:39:09,352
[SPEAKER_04]: It's soda, there is no argument.

1886
02:39:10,072 --> 02:39:13,215
[SPEAKER_04]: F you chat members for not commenting on my links I posted in chat.

1887
02:39:14,036 --> 02:39:18,559
[SPEAKER_04]: F you guys for not mentioning the revolution in the Dreamcast Xbox 360 PS3 discussion.

1888
02:39:19,060 --> 02:39:20,261
[SPEAKER_04]: Didn't Loki say it would be out?

1889
02:39:20,701 --> 02:39:25,125
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, we would talk about the revolution if Nintendo would throw us a frickin' bone and give us more to talk about.

1890
02:39:25,165 --> 02:39:28,788
[SPEAKER_04]: December 9th is when they're debuting some more info.

1891
02:39:29,208 --> 02:39:33,431
[SPEAKER_04]: They said they're never going to show the games until they're actually playable.

1892
02:39:33,671 --> 02:39:36,473
[SPEAKER_04]: Well then on December 9th is when we'll talk more about the revolution.

1893
02:39:36,493 --> 02:39:43,778
[SPEAKER_04]: NintendoManiac64 says, F you to myself for doing certain illegal activities that involve games, emulators, and downloading.

1894
02:39:44,158 --> 02:39:45,739
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, did I just type that out to Skye?

1895
02:39:45,759 --> 02:39:46,259
[SPEAKER_04]: Hee hee.

1896
02:39:47,000 --> 02:39:49,301
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, emulators are not illegal anymore.

1897
02:39:51,503 --> 02:39:57,606
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a loophole that's basically stated that the emulators themselves are not illegal.

1898
02:39:57,627 --> 02:39:58,227
[SPEAKER_04]: But the ROMs are.

1899
02:39:59,471 --> 02:40:00,131
[SPEAKER_04]: Possibly, yes.

1900
02:40:01,192 --> 02:40:09,978
[SPEAKER_04]: Roz says F you to my health teacher for telling the cast and crew of the play that we aren't allowed to turn on the stage lights anymore for practice because they use too much electricity.

1901
02:40:12,519 --> 02:40:13,620
[SPEAKER_04]: Excuse me, that's stupid.

1902
02:40:13,980 --> 02:40:17,762
[SPEAKER_04]: Goggle says F you to me for not calling in when I actually had something to say.

1903
02:40:18,143 --> 02:40:20,984
[SPEAKER_04]: And F you to the AI in Soul Calibur 3 for being hard.

1904
02:40:21,465 --> 02:40:21,925
[SPEAKER_04]: Seconded.

1905
02:40:22,725 --> 02:40:23,086
[SPEAKER_04]: Seconded.

1906
02:40:23,939 --> 02:40:26,221
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSetsuya says a continued FU to Squeenix.

1907
02:40:26,561 --> 02:40:29,343
[SPEAKER_04]: I was supposed to get my slime keychains and I haven't seen any sign of them.

1908
02:40:31,545 --> 02:40:36,769
[SPEAKER_04]: SSJ100Matt says FU to my boss pulling in office space and making me come in Saturday and Sunday for senseless crap.

1909
02:40:37,789 --> 02:40:43,233
[SPEAKER_04]: FU to my 4 year old Nvidia video card dying thus making me spend a whole $75 on a replacement.

1910
02:40:43,794 --> 02:40:46,136
[SPEAKER_04]: But just remember, Friday is Hawaiian Shirt Day.

1911
02:40:47,076 --> 02:40:47,336
[SPEAKER_04]: GS191...

1912
02:40:49,178 --> 02:40:49,638
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a joke.

1913
02:40:50,199 --> 02:40:50,459
[SPEAKER_07]: Get it?

1914
02:40:51,119 --> 02:40:52,000
[SPEAKER_07]: Have you seen Office Space?

1915
02:40:52,020 --> 02:40:53,441
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, that's right.

1916
02:40:53,621 --> 02:40:53,941
[SPEAKER_05]: Forget it.

1917
02:40:54,622 --> 02:40:58,104
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually, I also saw that movie with Yahoo Serious.

1918
02:41:00,045 --> 02:41:01,046
[SPEAKER_07]: No, no, not him.

1919
02:41:01,366 --> 02:41:01,966
[SPEAKER_07]: Carrot Top!

1920
02:41:02,667 --> 02:41:03,808
[SPEAKER_07]: What does it mean with Carrot Top?

1921
02:41:04,228 --> 02:41:04,568
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

1922
02:41:05,008 --> 02:41:08,030
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't watch any movies with Carrot Top in them.

1923
02:41:08,110 --> 02:41:11,353
[SPEAKER_07]: I caught it because I had to watch it because it was an E3.

1924
02:41:12,500 --> 02:41:13,601
[SPEAKER_04]: Can I do a tangent real quick?

1925
02:41:13,821 --> 02:41:14,401
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

1926
02:41:14,962 --> 02:41:19,065
[SPEAKER_04]: My coworker called and left a voicemail for my other coworker, and it was very hilarious.

1927
02:41:19,085 --> 02:41:19,745
[SPEAKER_04]: I got to hear this too.

1928
02:41:20,025 --> 02:41:26,690
[SPEAKER_04]: He used the soundboard from E-bombs World to leave this office space message saying, Yeah, we're going to need you to come in on Saturday.

1929
02:41:26,910 --> 02:41:27,811
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you get the memo?

1930
02:41:28,231 --> 02:41:28,771
[SPEAKER_04]: Really funny.

1931
02:41:29,211 --> 02:41:29,732
[SPEAKER_04]: Really funny.

1932
02:41:30,232 --> 02:41:31,613
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I'm going to call and leave him a Ms.

1933
02:41:31,633 --> 02:41:32,154
[SPEAKER_04]: Cleo message.

1934
02:41:32,174 --> 02:41:33,174
[SPEAKER_07]: Cleo Wednesday, that was it.

1935
02:41:33,534 --> 02:41:33,655
Yeah.

1936
02:41:34,035 --> 02:41:34,735
[SPEAKER_07]: Luau Wednesday.

1937
02:41:35,076 --> 02:41:35,676
[SPEAKER_04]: Luau Wednesday.

1938
02:41:38,004 --> 02:41:45,629
[SPEAKER_04]: More, GS191 says F you to the Xbox 360 kiosk for crashing and giving me the black screen of death and F you to my online math class.

1939
02:41:46,049 --> 02:41:47,850
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, it's nice to know some things in Microsoft never change.

1940
02:41:48,791 --> 02:41:56,336
[SPEAKER_04]: Dark Knight says F you to a customer today at my job that went nuts today just because we wouldn't exchange her year old leaf blower for a new one because it broke down.

1941
02:41:58,049 --> 02:42:00,232
[SPEAKER_04]: Jazz says, F you to the Xbox 360.

1942
02:42:00,573 --> 02:42:05,339
[SPEAKER_04]: I saw a demo of you at Best Buy and you lagged more than my computer that was on the verge of its HD exploding.

1943
02:42:05,700 --> 02:42:07,743
[SPEAKER_04]: Why must you keep making yourself look worse and worse?

1944
02:42:09,471 --> 02:42:20,178
[SPEAKER_04]: LegendOfZaku says, F you to the asshole customers I have to put up with in my tech help desk job here on campus, thinking that they know how we do shit so they bitch and moan when we tell them that we don't go to people's dorms to fix their PCs.

1945
02:42:20,758 --> 02:42:24,400
[SPEAKER_04]: In other words, they are too lazy to bring down their PC to our office for fixin'.

1946
02:42:24,901 --> 02:42:27,642
[SPEAKER_04]: F you to Hollywood in general for drowning us with shitty remake movies.

1947
02:42:27,902 --> 02:42:30,684
[SPEAKER_04]: You're unoriginal, so get off of your asses and give us some original shit.

1948
02:42:32,485 --> 02:42:35,747
[SPEAKER_04]: LegoGuitar says, F you to anyone who sucks.

1949
02:42:36,247 --> 02:42:38,409
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm in too much of a good mood to think of anything specific.

1950
02:42:39,793 --> 02:42:44,717
[SPEAKER_04]: And lastly, Sakurina says, F you to me because I still haven't unlocked everything on EX2 because I suck.

1951
02:42:45,217 --> 02:42:47,999
[SPEAKER_04]: And F you to Krista Berg for invading Quebec.

1952
02:42:50,201 --> 02:42:50,521
[SPEAKER_04]: One more.

1953
02:42:50,962 --> 02:42:54,124
[SPEAKER_04]: Ron Chan says, F you to my... I think it's boss, not booze.

1954
02:42:54,244 --> 02:42:57,767
[SPEAKER_04]: F you to my boss who decided to show up at my house 30 minutes ago with my paycheck.

1955
02:43:00,589 --> 02:43:01,490
[SPEAKER_04]: At least you got money out of it.

1956
02:43:02,751 --> 02:43:03,231
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

1957
02:43:04,332 --> 02:43:08,415
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for your angst, chatroom, you angsty, angsty individuals.

1958
02:43:11,585 --> 02:43:16,627
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to mention, vote for us, a 5 in your player window, on your live 365 player window.

1959
02:43:16,647 --> 02:43:22,770
[SPEAKER_04]: Your votes saying that we are a good station really helps us in getting the word out about Orange Lounge.

1960
02:43:22,850 --> 02:43:30,413
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, be sure to visit PodcastAlley.com and Podcast.Yahoo.com and vote for our podcast there, because the more votes we get, the cooler we are.

1961
02:43:32,014 --> 02:43:39,097
[SPEAKER_04]: There's actually a thread in our forums on OrangeLoungeRadio.com that says how you can help promote, and so we appreciate all the help that you guys give us.

1962
02:43:41,875 --> 02:43:43,456
[SPEAKER_04]: One other thing I want to mention for you guys.

1963
02:43:43,796 --> 02:43:43,896
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh!

1964
02:43:44,256 --> 02:43:45,677
[SPEAKER_04]: I missed, I'm sorry, there's one more.

1965
02:43:46,478 --> 02:43:46,818
[SPEAKER_15]: Shit!

1966
02:43:46,998 --> 02:43:47,999
[SPEAKER_04]: There's one more FU here.

1967
02:43:49,579 --> 02:43:50,480
[SPEAKER_04]: I better get to the music here.

1968
02:43:52,791 --> 02:43:54,791
[SPEAKER_04]: MPQ says F you to Sony.

1969
02:43:55,432 --> 02:43:57,892
[SPEAKER_04]: So you know about those retarded DRM CDs.

1970
02:43:58,292 --> 02:44:01,493
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's not enough that they fuck up people's computers and not care about it.

1971
02:44:01,813 --> 02:44:03,033
[SPEAKER_04]: Who knows what a rootkit is?

1972
02:44:03,373 --> 02:44:06,194
[SPEAKER_04]: The dumbest thing is that this has nothing to do with piracy at all.

1973
02:44:06,514 --> 02:44:08,174
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a pissing contest against Apple.

1974
02:44:08,434 --> 02:44:10,275
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, nothing to do with stopping piracy at all.

1975
02:44:10,555 --> 02:44:12,695
[SPEAKER_04]: Sony's just pissed because the iPod's beating them.

1976
02:44:12,995 --> 02:44:13,795
[SPEAKER_04]: Fuck you, Sony.

1977
02:44:13,995 --> 02:44:15,096
[SPEAKER_04]: You're being fucking idiots.

1978
02:44:15,376 --> 02:44:16,716
[SPEAKER_04]: And you lost my business.

1979
02:44:20,097 --> 02:44:21,037
[SPEAKER_04]: Better late than never, right?

1980
02:44:21,297 --> 02:44:21,517
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

1981
02:44:23,154 --> 02:44:27,740
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to bring up something that was on the OrangeLoungeRadio.com website earlier this week.

1982
02:44:27,780 --> 02:44:28,961
[SPEAKER_04]: I think this is kind of interesting.

1983
02:44:29,282 --> 02:44:31,484
[SPEAKER_04]: Konami is launching a new campaign

1984
02:44:32,383 --> 02:44:33,384
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought this was interesting.

1985
02:44:33,404 --> 02:44:39,028
[SPEAKER_04]: They've launched a brand new website, and it's called Music in Every Direction.

1986
02:44:39,908 --> 02:44:50,956
[SPEAKER_04]: And we're not really sure what the fuck this is supposed to be, but it is a promo device, absolutely, at least, for DDR Extreme 2, Karaoke Revolution Party, and DDR Ultramix 3.

1987
02:44:51,737 --> 02:44:52,518
[SPEAKER_04]: And you can check this out.

1988
02:44:52,578 --> 02:44:54,419
[SPEAKER_04]: It's musicineverydirection.com.

1989
02:44:54,719 --> 02:44:56,961
[SPEAKER_04]: And all that's there right now are little bitty pictures.

1990
02:44:57,461 --> 02:45:05,926
[SPEAKER_04]: of all those games, and enter your information below to stay up to date on the latest Konami music games and receive notification when the official website opens.

1991
02:45:08,047 --> 02:45:14,971
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm not sure, so I guess, oh, some people are saying they saw a commercial on TV, so is this like their marketing campaign, how they're going to market all these games?

1992
02:45:15,351 --> 02:45:16,492
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki, you know anything about this?

1993
02:45:16,552 --> 02:45:19,234
[SPEAKER_04]: You posted this to our website, so I thought maybe you'd know.

1994
02:45:19,554 --> 02:45:20,735
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't post this to our website.

1995
02:45:20,775 --> 02:45:21,315
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought you did.

1996
02:45:21,415 --> 02:45:22,496
[SPEAKER_04]: Who did?

1997
02:45:22,556 --> 02:45:23,036
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, damn it.

1998
02:45:24,158 --> 02:45:24,718
[SPEAKER_22]: Copy that.

1999
02:45:24,758 --> 02:45:25,178
[SPEAKER_22]: Something else.

2000
02:45:25,399 --> 02:45:25,679
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, well.

2001
02:45:26,639 --> 02:45:27,980
[SPEAKER_04]: So I guess it's on TV.

2002
02:45:28,280 --> 02:45:30,381
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess I don't watch enough TV because I haven't seen these commercials.

2003
02:45:30,401 --> 02:45:30,981
[SPEAKER_22]: I haven't seen it either.

2004
02:45:31,081 --> 02:45:39,525
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't... During Elimidate, I saw the Guitar Hero with Loki and Dark Sakura commercial, but I did not see the commercial.

2005
02:45:39,565 --> 02:45:40,045
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, anyway.

2006
02:45:40,405 --> 02:45:40,885
[SPEAKER_22]: Oh, goody.

2007
02:45:41,526 --> 02:45:42,666
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm just waiting for that.

2008
02:45:43,226 --> 02:45:45,387
[SPEAKER_22]: I know they're going to... You know who I'm buying Guitar Hero with?

2009
02:45:46,388 --> 02:45:46,628
[SPEAKER_22]: Hmm.

2010
02:45:46,928 --> 02:45:48,749
[SPEAKER_22]: My best buy bucks from McDonald's.

2011
02:45:49,109 --> 02:45:49,849
[SPEAKER_22]: Hell yes.

2012
02:45:51,290 --> 02:45:52,951
[SPEAKER_22]: I have $31 of that stuff now.

2013
02:45:53,171 --> 02:45:53,651
[SPEAKER_04]: Interesting.

2014
02:45:55,415 --> 02:46:00,878
[SPEAKER_22]: Plus $15 from the puppies, because I bought all three of them and they gave me the file.

2015
02:46:01,578 --> 02:46:03,699
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, I only have to pay like three bucks for the whole thing.

2016
02:46:04,379 --> 02:46:05,160
[SPEAKER_22]: Not bad, not bad.

2017
02:46:05,640 --> 02:46:07,701
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, now I'm curious, what the fuck is this website you're on?

2018
02:46:07,721 --> 02:46:09,262
[SPEAKER_04]: Because it's moving by itself.

2019
02:46:09,482 --> 02:46:11,423
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like, it's a ghost thing.

2020
02:46:11,643 --> 02:46:13,484
[SPEAKER_04]: It looks like fridge magnet poetry.

2021
02:46:13,564 --> 02:46:14,644
[SPEAKER_04]: What the fuck is this site you're on?

2022
02:46:15,024 --> 02:46:15,785
[SPEAKER_22]: Oh, this is nothing.

2023
02:46:15,805 --> 02:46:20,387
[SPEAKER_22]: This is just some retarded viral campaign that no one cares about for the 360 that it has.

2024
02:46:21,954 --> 02:46:23,955
[SPEAKER_22]: Okay, I can sum this up the best way.

2025
02:46:24,056 --> 02:46:35,343
[SPEAKER_22]: It's like people were talking about, you know when Isle of Bees came out and stuff, that was cool because viral campaigning was kind of unseen and alternate reality gaming was kind of like brand new.

2026
02:46:36,384 --> 02:46:38,866
[SPEAKER_04]: Now when everybody does it, it's not cool anymore.

2027
02:46:39,386 --> 02:46:42,228
[SPEAKER_22]: So, remember Hex 168 came out, that 360 site?

2028
02:46:42,248 --> 02:46:43,329
[SPEAKER_22]: Well, hexadecimal of 168 is 360.

2029
02:46:49,730 --> 02:47:09,018
[SPEAKER_22]: This right here in binary is 360, and then there's this stupid thing that you go and type and stuff, and basically you can type in this, and there's little binary things, and there's a countdown, which, by the way, ends on the 15th, I want to say, at, I believe, 7 p.m.

2030
02:47:09,118 --> 02:47:12,239
[SPEAKER_22]: Pacific time, wherever the hell that's supposed to be.

2031
02:47:12,339 --> 02:47:12,719
[SPEAKER_22]: But anyways,

2032
02:47:13,351 --> 02:47:23,159
[SPEAKER_22]: Um, so there's this thing, if you type in play in that, it takes you to this other screen, where I think there's these, all these things, and basically everyone's like, oh my god, you know, it's, it's some, you know, puzzle, we have to figure it out.

2033
02:47:23,179 --> 02:47:27,062
[SPEAKER_22]: No, actually, you just type this stuff in, and other people type stuff, and they respond back to you, and

2034
02:47:27,622 --> 02:47:29,264
[SPEAKER_22]: All that stuff, and these can all move around.

2035
02:47:29,284 --> 02:47:29,764
[SPEAKER_04]: What, the chat room?

2036
02:47:30,425 --> 02:47:31,326
[SPEAKER_04]: It's sort of a chat room.

2037
02:47:31,346 --> 02:47:32,787
[SPEAKER_04]: Are people actually moving those?

2038
02:47:32,847 --> 02:47:34,028
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, people are moving these.

2039
02:47:34,088 --> 02:47:36,410
[SPEAKER_22]: Like, right now, I'm going to move a bunch of these at random.

2040
02:47:36,971 --> 02:47:40,935
[SPEAKER_22]: And piss people off, because people are trying to, like, you know, type stuff in here.

2041
02:47:41,575 --> 02:47:44,799
[SPEAKER_22]: And so I am moving them around to piss them off.

2042
02:47:48,908 --> 02:47:52,591
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm going to type poop and we're going to see if that appears.

2043
02:47:52,731 --> 02:47:54,693
[SPEAKER_22]: No, actually, see there's Firefly.

2044
02:47:55,333 --> 02:47:56,534
[SPEAKER_22]: Someone just typed that earlier.

2045
02:47:56,934 --> 02:47:58,115
[SPEAKER_04]: I was doing this the other day.

2046
02:47:58,235 --> 02:48:07,362
[SPEAKER_22]: I kept typing Orange Lounge Radio over and over and over again just for the fuck of it because it'll actually appear at one point because you've typed it in so many times.

2047
02:48:08,103 --> 02:48:08,483
[SPEAKER_22]: But, um...

2048
02:48:09,625 --> 02:48:11,647
[SPEAKER_22]: So we'll just see if we can get this up here.

2049
02:48:11,967 --> 02:48:12,567
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, have fun with it.

2050
02:48:12,587 --> 02:48:13,448
[SPEAKER_04]: What's the website for that again?

2051
02:48:13,868 --> 02:48:21,555
[SPEAKER_04]: The website for this is www.101101000.com slash zero.

2052
02:48:23,276 --> 02:48:24,437
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, good luck remembering that.

2053
02:48:24,457 --> 02:48:26,419
[SPEAKER_04]: Can you post that in chat, please?

2054
02:48:26,479 --> 02:48:31,303
[SPEAKER_04]: Meanwhile, we're going to go back to the Skype line because I promised some folks we'd go to the Skype line a little later in the show.

2055
02:48:31,803 --> 02:48:33,604
[SPEAKER_04]: And wouldn't you know it, we already have a call.

2056
02:48:33,925 --> 02:48:35,046
[SPEAKER_04]: Hello, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

2057
02:48:36,229 --> 02:48:36,950
[SPEAKER_23]: Hey, what's up?

2058
02:48:37,010 --> 02:48:37,650
[SPEAKER_23]: It's Ranma.

2059
02:48:38,031 --> 02:48:39,572
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, Ronchan, how are you?

2060
02:48:39,652 --> 02:48:40,052
[SPEAKER_23]: Hello!

2061
02:48:40,853 --> 02:48:42,594
[SPEAKER_23]: Hey, hi everybody, I'm Jamie.

2062
02:48:43,495 --> 02:48:44,015
[SPEAKER_29]: What's on your mind?

2063
02:48:45,316 --> 02:48:47,678
[SPEAKER_23]: Not much, I just want to touch upon a couple of things.

2064
02:48:48,519 --> 02:48:57,206
[SPEAKER_23]: Xbox 360, if you're going to get one, I would suggest if you're on the Best Buy, I would get there about, oh, say, 5, 6 p.m.

2065
02:48:59,187 --> 02:49:00,048
[SPEAKER_04]: That's crazy talk.

2066
02:49:01,619 --> 02:49:03,120
[SPEAKER_23]: I was there for the PSP.

2067
02:49:03,861 --> 02:49:04,982
[SPEAKER_23]: I got there at 7 a.m.

2068
02:49:05,002 --> 02:49:05,903
[SPEAKER_23]: to take pictures.

2069
02:49:06,143 --> 02:49:08,125
[SPEAKER_23]: There were people there at 6 a.m.

2070
02:49:09,666 --> 02:49:12,669
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, you also live in New York City, though, so... Yeah.

2071
02:49:13,610 --> 02:49:13,930
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

2072
02:49:14,250 --> 02:49:15,592
[SPEAKER_23]: No, no, no, no.

2073
02:49:15,692 --> 02:49:17,613
[SPEAKER_23]: This is where I was living in the suburbs.

2074
02:49:17,794 --> 02:49:18,714
[SPEAKER_23]: I was in the city there.

2075
02:49:18,734 --> 02:49:20,836
[SPEAKER_23]: This was the suburbs where my desk might open up at 10.

2076
02:49:21,357 --> 02:49:23,859
[SPEAKER_23]: There were people there at 7.

2077
02:49:24,039 --> 02:49:26,662
[SPEAKER_23]: We opened so early just to sell the PSP's.

2078
02:49:27,856 --> 02:49:34,579
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, we're having kind of a hard time understanding you, Ran Chan, so you're kind of coming through really blurry.

2079
02:49:34,899 --> 02:49:36,900
[SPEAKER_07]: Also, Rob has suddenly developed an accent.

2080
02:49:37,480 --> 02:49:37,720
[SPEAKER_04]: I did?

2081
02:49:40,562 --> 02:49:40,962
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

2082
02:49:41,462 --> 02:49:42,162
[SPEAKER_04]: What did I say?

2083
02:49:43,203 --> 02:49:43,983
[SPEAKER_07]: Understand.

2084
02:49:44,643 --> 02:49:45,044
[SPEAKER_04]: Whatever.

2085
02:49:46,084 --> 02:49:46,484
[SPEAKER_04]: Whatever.

2086
02:49:47,245 --> 02:49:52,147
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, so Ran Chan, you want to tell us really quick about some Nintendo event you went to?

2087
02:49:53,107 --> 02:49:57,189
[SPEAKER_23]: Yeah, I went to the Nintendo World DDR Mario Mix Contest.

2088
02:49:58,928 --> 02:49:59,649
[SPEAKER_05]: And what happened?

2089
02:49:59,949 --> 02:50:03,011
[SPEAKER_23]: People got screwed.

2090
02:50:03,332 --> 02:50:05,914
[SPEAKER_23]: They had everything developed in different colors.

2091
02:50:06,434 --> 02:50:08,536
[SPEAKER_23]: And the topic that we covered was that.

2092
02:50:10,237 --> 02:50:14,220
[SPEAKER_23]: But what happened was, they only did it for two rounds.

2093
02:50:14,460 --> 02:50:17,523
[SPEAKER_23]: After that, every time, the top six get to advance.

2094
02:50:17,843 --> 02:50:21,606
[SPEAKER_23]: Basically about 30, 20 people got screwed out of tournament.

2095
02:50:22,549 --> 02:50:26,351
[SPEAKER_04]: Aw, it's a bummer, but I guess that's going to happen in probably one of the bigger cities or something.

2096
02:50:26,791 --> 02:50:32,153
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, Ranchen, since you're kind of breaking up, I am going to have to let you go, but we hope we can talk to you again soon, a little later, okay?

2097
02:50:33,053 --> 02:50:33,493
[SPEAKER_04]: Take care.

2098
02:50:34,234 --> 02:50:34,594
[SPEAKER_04]: Later!

2099
02:50:35,717 --> 02:50:40,661
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, well, I think what he said there was about the DDR with Mario event at the official Nintendo Store.

2100
02:50:40,682 --> 02:50:45,866
[SPEAKER_04]: It sounds like people got screwed out of it somehow after only a couple rounds.

2101
02:50:46,066 --> 02:50:46,627
[SPEAKER_04]: That's too bad.

2102
02:50:46,767 --> 02:50:52,812
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki, you were saying you got Orange Lounge to appear on the site, and it looks like everybody's moving things to the corners now.

2103
02:50:53,733 --> 02:50:57,136
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, see, there's Orange Lounge right here.

2104
02:50:57,176 --> 02:50:59,318
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm holding it, and I'm shaking it around.

2105
02:51:01,160 --> 02:51:01,841
[SPEAKER_04]: That's great.

2106
02:51:04,957 --> 02:51:14,071
[SPEAKER_04]: so our listeners are all on there just shuffling shit into all the corners beautiful God I love our listeners I so so love them

2107
02:51:15,993 --> 02:51:17,214
[SPEAKER_04]: Another call on Skype line.

2108
02:51:17,234 --> 02:51:18,375
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

2109
02:51:18,995 --> 02:51:20,777
[SPEAKER_04]: Obviously, I don't need any introduction.

2110
02:51:21,657 --> 02:51:23,539
[SPEAKER_04]: Not at this point, Mr. Zaku.

2111
02:51:23,819 --> 02:51:24,540
[SPEAKER_04]: What's on your mind?

2112
02:51:25,881 --> 02:51:28,623
[SPEAKER_25]: Just a comment on the little DDR Mario mix thing.

2113
02:51:28,643 --> 02:51:33,727
[SPEAKER_25]: The reason why people were getting screwed over is because, you know, it's Nintendo World's fault.

2114
02:51:33,827 --> 02:51:41,173
[SPEAKER_25]: You know, I squarely put the blame on Nintendo World for the fact that they didn't go to DDR Freak or any of those sites to advertise the tournament.

2115
02:51:41,813 --> 02:51:42,353
[SPEAKER_25]: So they suck.

2116
02:52:03,154 --> 02:52:09,316
[SPEAKER_25]: Yeah, but you know, the whole DDR Mario Mix pretty much, you know, that whole tournament thing, you know, is a joke.

2117
02:52:09,576 --> 02:52:11,837
[SPEAKER_25]: Okay, well DDR Mario Mix is a joke anyway, too.

2118
02:52:12,177 --> 02:52:17,059
[SPEAKER_04]: So what I'm curious about, Saku, what's the latest on MTV?

2119
02:52:17,079 --> 02:52:18,500
[SPEAKER_04]: Because you're going to be rich and famous, right?

2120
02:52:19,092 --> 02:52:20,493
[SPEAKER_25]: Yeah, I got the email.

2121
02:52:20,673 --> 02:52:23,175
[SPEAKER_25]: They sent me an email last Thursday.

2122
02:52:23,215 --> 02:52:24,375
[SPEAKER_25]: I've already replied to them.

2123
02:52:24,836 --> 02:52:28,137
[SPEAKER_25]: They're going to be filming next Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday.

2124
02:52:28,418 --> 02:52:32,960
[SPEAKER_25]: Hopefully, I should be able to make it next Wednesday if I get more information from them.

2125
02:52:33,741 --> 02:52:37,403
[SPEAKER_25]: And then a week after that, during MTV's Gaming Week, a.k.a.

2126
02:52:37,483 --> 02:52:40,344
[SPEAKER_25]: the Xbox 360 Launch Week, they will air it.

2127
02:52:41,585 --> 02:52:52,070
[SPEAKER_04]: If you can somehow get Orange Lounge in there, whether it be like a picture in the background, or you know, your name dropping it, or somehow Orange Lounge gets in there, I will... Dude, if you send me an OLR shirt, I will marry.

2128
02:52:52,951 --> 02:52:53,431
[SPEAKER_25]: Seriously.

2129
02:52:53,551 --> 02:53:01,435
[SPEAKER_25]: If you would make me an extra large shirt that says, in black, that says Orange Lounge Radio on it, I would definitely wear that shirt out.

2130
02:53:01,555 --> 02:53:01,935
[SPEAKER_25]: Damn it.

2131
02:53:02,596 --> 02:53:04,437
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe, I don't know if we can get it done in time.

2132
02:53:05,257 --> 02:53:07,018
[SPEAKER_04]: But, I'll send you a dollar.

2133
02:53:11,003 --> 02:53:17,825
[SPEAKER_25]: Also, 1UP.com is saying that Beatmania is being pushed up early to the 15th of February of next year.

2134
02:53:20,286 --> 02:53:24,608
[SPEAKER_04]: I do not know of any changes inside Konami as far as I know.

2135
02:53:24,648 --> 02:53:27,449
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I know what 1UP.com is saying, but I don't agree with it.

2136
02:53:28,009 --> 02:53:28,409
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll see.

2137
02:53:28,589 --> 02:53:28,949
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll see.

2138
02:53:29,989 --> 02:53:30,349
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe.

2139
02:53:30,409 --> 02:53:34,911
[SPEAKER_04]: I could see it getting bumped up, but as far as I know, it's not done yet, so we'll see.

2140
02:53:36,553 --> 02:53:36,833
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

2141
02:53:37,474 --> 02:53:38,995
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, Zachary, we're going to let you go.

2142
02:53:39,135 --> 02:53:40,016
[SPEAKER_25]: Just do whatever.

2143
02:53:40,236 --> 02:53:42,638
[SPEAKER_25]: Just see if you could try to send me a shirt or something.

2144
02:53:43,259 --> 02:53:48,604
[SPEAKER_25]: I seriously would allow you to use me as a billboard or some sort of advertising.

2145
02:53:48,684 --> 02:53:51,947
[SPEAKER_25]: We want to do the shirt thing so bad, but it's just a cost issue.

2146
02:53:52,407 --> 02:53:53,148
[SPEAKER_25]: Or something like that.

2147
02:53:54,849 --> 02:53:55,190
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

2148
02:53:55,750 --> 02:53:57,071
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, Zachary, we're going to let you go, okay?

2149
02:53:57,151 --> 02:53:57,632
[SPEAKER_04]: Have a good one.

2150
02:53:57,792 --> 02:53:59,774
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, just think about it, man.

2151
02:54:00,194 --> 02:54:00,574
[SPEAKER_04]: I know.

2152
02:54:00,634 --> 02:54:01,415
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll get it.

2153
02:54:01,555 --> 02:54:01,795
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

2154
02:54:01,835 --> 02:54:02,256
[SPEAKER_04]: Take care.

2155
02:54:03,036 --> 02:54:03,277
[SPEAKER_04]: Later.

2156
02:54:04,056 --> 02:54:05,276
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, just so you know.

2157
02:54:05,296 --> 02:54:06,337
[SPEAKER_04]: What's going on now on the site?

2158
02:54:06,357 --> 02:54:07,917
[SPEAKER_04]: We've got like tons of people on the desk.

2159
02:54:07,957 --> 02:54:08,637
[SPEAKER_04]: It's really funny.

2160
02:54:09,757 --> 02:54:22,501
[SPEAKER_22]: The name of the page, the title, it is 101101000 and then colon, it's so much fun.

2161
02:54:24,581 --> 02:54:24,921
[SPEAKER_04]: What?

2162
02:54:25,882 --> 02:54:27,862
[SPEAKER_04]: Somebody actually put it so much fun on there?

2163
02:54:27,882 --> 02:54:30,723
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I think it just, I don't know how it appeared on there, but...

2164
02:54:33,786 --> 02:54:35,106
[SPEAKER_04]: It just says it's so much fun.

2165
02:54:35,886 --> 02:54:37,007
[SPEAKER_04]: That's great.

2166
02:54:37,167 --> 02:54:38,167
[SPEAKER_04]: So I gotta watch this.

2167
02:54:38,187 --> 02:54:39,067
[SPEAKER_04]: What is going on here?

2168
02:54:39,087 --> 02:54:42,148
[SPEAKER_04]: So everybody's on the site just like shuffling around.

2169
02:54:42,168 --> 02:54:42,908
[SPEAKER_04]: Zombie butts.

2170
02:54:43,628 --> 02:54:44,468
[SPEAKER_04]: I love Ross.

2171
02:54:46,148 --> 02:54:47,008
[SPEAKER_04]: Goat say love.

2172
02:54:48,309 --> 02:54:49,689
[SPEAKER_04]: Orange love Japan.

2173
02:54:51,049 --> 02:54:54,070
[SPEAKER_04]: No you don't, you fucker.

2174
02:54:54,090 --> 02:54:54,450
[SPEAKER_04]: That was great.

2175
02:54:54,830 --> 02:54:55,910
[SPEAKER_04]: Jamie's fighting with somebody.

2176
02:54:55,930 --> 02:54:57,930
[SPEAKER_04]: Whoever keeps touching orange rounds, stop.

2177
02:54:58,971 --> 02:55:00,351
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm trying to get me on there, but...

2178
02:55:01,267 --> 02:55:04,009
[SPEAKER_04]: DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

2179
02:55:29,075 --> 02:55:32,076
[SPEAKER_21]: I have some thoughts about the Xbox 360 and everything.

2180
02:55:32,296 --> 02:55:34,536
[SPEAKER_04]: Please, tell us your thoughts on the Xbox 360.

2181
02:55:36,097 --> 02:55:40,018
[SPEAKER_21]: I saw it at Best Buy, and it looked like crap.

2182
02:55:41,338 --> 02:55:41,778
[SPEAKER_21]: And what?

2183
02:55:42,598 --> 02:55:43,559
[SPEAKER_21]: It looked like crap.

2184
02:55:43,739 --> 02:55:44,679
[SPEAKER_04]: What was wrong with it?

2185
02:55:45,699 --> 02:55:46,939
[SPEAKER_21]: It was really laggy.

2186
02:55:46,999 --> 02:55:52,921
[SPEAKER_21]: They were playing King Kong, and everything was running at 15 FPS at that.

2187
02:55:53,661 --> 02:55:55,962
[SPEAKER_04]: It looked like me playing Final Fantasy XI in lower Juno.

2188
02:55:56,862 --> 02:55:57,562
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, basically.

2189
02:55:58,237 --> 02:55:59,198
[SPEAKER_21]: It was really bad.

2190
02:55:59,218 --> 02:56:02,880
[SPEAKER_21]: I was like, damn, this is what everybody's worked it up about.

2191
02:56:03,421 --> 02:56:05,882
[SPEAKER_04]: So needless to say, you're not going to be buying an Xbox 360?

2192
02:56:07,063 --> 02:56:08,464
[SPEAKER_21]: Not at the moment, no.

2193
02:56:08,905 --> 02:56:09,145
[SPEAKER_21]: Nuh-uh.

2194
02:56:09,325 --> 02:56:12,207
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm going to stick with my ghetto, broken-down Xbox for now.

2195
02:56:12,287 --> 02:56:13,928
[SPEAKER_07]: I know what he's going to do instead.

2196
02:56:14,368 --> 02:56:14,649
[SPEAKER_21]: What?

2197
02:56:15,069 --> 02:56:15,269
[SPEAKER_21]: What?

2198
02:56:17,130 --> 02:56:18,711
[SPEAKER_07]: What did you just buy last week?

2199
02:56:19,132 --> 02:56:20,773
[SPEAKER_07]: Hint, nudge, elbow.

2200
02:56:22,737 --> 02:56:23,778
[SPEAKER_21]: Uh, Star Hero?

2201
02:56:24,278 --> 02:56:24,939
[SPEAKER_07]: No!

2202
02:56:25,259 --> 02:56:26,519
[SPEAKER_07]: You bought one month of what?

2203
02:56:28,080 --> 02:56:28,361
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh!

2204
02:56:28,701 --> 02:56:29,201
[SPEAKER_07]: Light goes on.

2205
02:56:29,501 --> 02:56:31,142
[SPEAKER_07]: Here, World of Warcraft.

2206
02:56:32,143 --> 02:56:33,864
[SPEAKER_21]: I know, I got sucked in for another month.

2207
02:56:33,964 --> 02:56:35,745
[SPEAKER_04]: Congratulations on that, by the way.

2208
02:56:36,506 --> 02:56:36,846
[SPEAKER_21]: I know.

2209
02:56:37,666 --> 02:56:39,548
[SPEAKER_07]: Man, I wasn't even home for five minutes last week.

2210
02:56:39,828 --> 02:56:40,628
[SPEAKER_07]: What server are you on?

2211
02:56:42,269 --> 02:56:44,811
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh... Yeah, I'm not telling it on air, but yeah.

2212
02:56:51,069 --> 02:56:55,191
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's great.

2213
02:56:56,091 --> 02:57:00,372
[SPEAKER_21]: I think it's leaps and bounds better than Guitar Freaks ever was.

2214
02:57:01,793 --> 02:57:07,335
[SPEAKER_21]: Just because of the fact that it's not all Richard J-pop, and I think that appeals a lot more to people.

2215
02:57:10,096 --> 02:57:11,556
[SPEAKER_21]: Besides that, yeah, it's a great game.

2216
02:57:12,076 --> 02:57:16,218
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's definitely different than Guitar Freaks, certainly a different song list, and it's going to appeal to a whole different audience.

2217
02:57:16,792 --> 02:57:20,114
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, well, Jazz, we've got to go because we've got to wrap up the show, but thanks so much for calling in, okay?

2218
02:57:20,134 --> 02:57:21,515
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, bye.

2219
02:57:21,755 --> 02:57:22,256
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, later.

2220
02:57:22,276 --> 02:57:23,656
[SPEAKER_04]: Bye.

2221
02:57:23,676 --> 02:57:25,598
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, that's going to do it for our Skype calls tonight.

2222
02:57:26,378 --> 02:57:33,823
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, now's the part of the show where we're going to go around and get everybody's final thoughts because it's that time of the show where we're almost done.

2223
02:57:34,263 --> 02:57:36,244
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're going to start it off by going over to Angel.

2224
02:57:37,005 --> 02:57:38,906
[SPEAKER_04]: Angel, what is your final thought of the evening?

2225
02:57:43,829 --> 02:57:45,731
[SPEAKER_07]: Must buy Guitar Hero.

2226
02:57:48,445 --> 02:57:50,947
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway, Loki.

2227
02:57:52,248 --> 02:57:55,931
[SPEAKER_22]: I lost where my name went on this page.

2228
02:57:56,472 --> 02:57:57,072
[SPEAKER_22]: Oh, there we are.

2229
02:57:57,272 --> 02:58:00,395
[SPEAKER_22]: Whoa, I have like three names on there now.

2230
02:58:00,895 --> 02:58:02,336
[SPEAKER_22]: It says Loki as goats say.

2231
02:58:04,018 --> 02:58:04,378
[SPEAKER_04]: Awesome.

2232
02:58:05,539 --> 02:58:09,422
[SPEAKER_04]: My final thought is ciabatta bread is yummy.

2233
02:58:09,642 --> 02:58:10,663
[SPEAKER_04]: It's my favorite thing ever.

2234
02:58:11,724 --> 02:58:13,185
[SPEAKER_04]: And DarkSakura, your final thought.

2235
02:58:14,186 --> 02:58:15,327
[SPEAKER_07]: Rejectable cyclones.

2236
02:58:15,607 --> 02:58:16,688
[SPEAKER_07]: Somebody send me to London.

2237
02:58:19,011 --> 02:58:21,352
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, that's going to do it for tonight's show.

2238
02:58:21,392 --> 02:58:22,232
[SPEAKER_04]: Tune in next week.

2239
02:58:22,732 --> 02:58:24,233
[SPEAKER_04]: Tune into the podcast as well.

2240
02:58:24,893 --> 02:58:30,295
[SPEAKER_04]: Next week, the one and only DarkSakura will not be here, sadly, because she'll be glamming it up at the podcast awards.

2241
02:58:31,395 --> 02:58:33,396
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll represent if Jamie lets me grin.

2242
02:58:36,377 --> 02:58:45,600
[SPEAKER_04]: If I get my way, we'll have a whole orgy of people here, because DarkSakura's chair is not an easy one to fill, so we'll have to get like five people to all sit in it at the same time, naked.

2243
02:58:46,573 --> 02:58:46,873
[SPEAKER_04]: Zombie Butts

2244
