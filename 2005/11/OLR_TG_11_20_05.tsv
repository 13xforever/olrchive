129	2472	Orange Lounge Radio To Go Edition, week of November 21st, 2005.
2592	13848	You're tuned in to the Orange Lounge Radio To Go Edition, your podcast home for all the latest video game news and gamer chat.
14088	17533	Now, here are your hosts, DarkSakura, Sky, and Loki.
18959	27910	Hello everybody, once again, welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio To Go, that podcast dedicated to what you gamers really want to know about.
28590	36620	And you know, we like to talk about video games that don't suck on this show, although sometimes we will talk about games that do suck, but only to tell you to stay far, far away.
36720	38082	Avoid like the plague.
39771	41833	Say hello to... Oh, my name is Rob Roberts.
41853	42713	You might know me as Sky.
42733	43614	I should introduce myself.
43634	46556	And then I'll introduce the co-hosts we have over there sitting next to me, Loki.
47077	47957	Yes, I'm here.
48178	51740	Alright, and joining us on Skype line tonight, say hello to DarkSakura.
52441	52741	Hi.
53061	53722	How are you doing?
54742	55123	Sick.
55803	56784	Now, what happened?
57124	60607	Did you catch something from Adam Curry at the podcast awards, or what happened?
61167	63749	No, I was already sick when I was there, apparently.
63909	64590	Apparently.
65103	73427	I had a cold, turned into a sinus infection, LA made it worse, and now I have a pretty nasty case of bronchitis.
74687	77388	It's like God doesn't want you to be on this show or something.
77428	79669	I don't know what the hell's going on, DarkSakura.
79810	80490	It happens.
80950	90634	Every time this year, I tend to get some type of respiratory illness, but last year I didn't get it, and I think it was just because I lost all that weight the year before, and I
93135	95696	This year it's like, hi, you remember me?
95716	96516	I'm back.
96757	98097	Let's give you pneumonia now.
98337	100118	It's just a healthy... They x-rayed me for pneumonia.
100438	101819	It's just a healthy LA air.
102739	104660	I swear it had to have been that.
105100	106881	Well, real quick, how was the podcast awards?
107801	109702	It was... We weren't there for very long.
110582	111603	Julie went with me.
112123	115104	I said, you know, she helps us out sometimes.
115184	115464	Oh, yeah.
116865	117005	And...
118071	124674	Actually, let me real quick, let me say, there are a lot of folks behind the scenes that help us out with a lot of things that sometimes don't get their due credit, especially Jason.
124975	133659	Oh my god, we'd be dead in the water without Jason, so thank you to Jason, and Julie, and Jess over at DDR Freak, and just everybody who helps us out behind the scenes and doesn't get their credit sometimes.
133719	134439	So, anyway.
135900	138641	Julie kept my road rage down to a minimum on the trip.
140222	141563	Which, there was plenty of that.
142163	142283	Hmm.
143430	144391	How was the awards themselves?
145051	149515	The ceremony itself, it was sort of like, let's give it everybody on stage, give them their thing, get off.
150296	152557	Only the people who win the big prizes get to talk.
153558	158882	And I got to see Adam Curry, who looks a lot more handsome now than he did in his MTV days.
161144	161465	Alright.
162445	163446	Met some cool people.
163666	166729	I met Frank from The Overnightscape.
169031	171292	Haven't had a chance yet to check out his podcast.
171312	173094	Basically, I came back to homework
176060	178802	Actually, I came back to homework and then getting sick again.
180162	181643	I went to the doctor soon after I got back.
182063	184685	So, leading into our next topic, how was your gaming week?
184745	186506	I imagine you probably haven't gotten a lot of gaming done.
187586	197612	Actually, I can say that the last weekend was pretty much taken up by Phantasy Star Online for the Xbox.
198552	200053	There was a lot of that going around.
200113	201234	Are there still a lot of people on there?
202056	203937	Apparently so, yeah.
204518	215046	But the guy that we stayed with, he was busy playing that, and then Julie was showing him Blueburst, so we had some Blueburst going on.
215486	215606	Cool.
215626	220209	So I was kind of glad I didn't uninstall it off my laptop, because they used that version.
221170	230177	And actually, the theme for my house has been Need for Speed Underground Most Wanted, which...
231055	231896	Looks kind of pretty.
231936	235978	I'm reserving my judgment for the Xbox 360 version when it's out.
236839	248666	But, you know, right now, it just looks kind of... It's got lots of prettiness going on and lots of destructiveness going on, but I've kind of had my fill of watching that game.
249226	258472	Unfortunately, the 360 version is only a port, so it's only a little bit better, and I hear that they've got some really bad loading, like, choppiness in it, so...
259321	262183	Like I said, I'm going to reserve my judgment for actually seeing it.
262544	262984	We'll see.
263605	266487	Alright, so is that all you pretty much have for your gaming week?
267848	269589	Yeah, that's pretty much it.
270070	274213	I've had this copy of Mario Kart DS sitting on my computer desk now for a week.
274674	276295	You've got to open that thing soon.
276915	277396	It's awesome.
277416	278257	Well, no, it's open.
278317	279017	It's sitting there.
279037	282480	It just hasn't been in my DS yet.
282580	284341	Get some use out of that this Thanksgiving.
284382	284802	It's great.
285723	286143	Alright.
287066	288127	Loki, how was your gaming week?
289087	293290	My week was filled with Shadow Colossus, which is fun.
293530	294030	Haven't really got any.
294050	294951	Haven't you beaten that yet?
295531	296732	No, I haven't really been playing it.
298873	300134	Mainly Mario Kart DS.
300374	303116	I've been pounding out trying to get Rob unlocked.
303356	305237	I have to beat the entire game for that.
305417	306918	Not me, Rob, but Rob the Robot.
306938	308399	Rob the Robot, yeah.
308939	311381	And it's pretty cool, and the online stuff's pretty fun.
311401	313342	It does take a little time to get
313462	313682	DarkSakura,
331957	332918	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
358314	360035	You're still convinced you're getting it Tuesday, huh?
360215	365258	I'm not sure if I'm getting it Tuesday, but I know I'm not getting it after Christmas, like they say.
365318	369080	I don't believe that they're going to be that long.
369501	374624	What's the big deal if you hype this system up as the big thing for Christmas and you don't ship anymore?
374664	375544	That's kind of retarded.
375904	376765	I agree.
376785	378166	We're getting one.
378766	378966	Huh?
379667	380207	We're getting one.
381135	388161	See, you have that lucky thing of being very close with a GameStop employee that can manage to get you one, right?
388942	391464	Well, yeah.
391624	393866	Actually, I had something else about my gaming week.
394026	395648	Oh, what's that?
396669	403154	My extreme amounts of giddiness after finding out that Kingdom Hearts 2 is having a Tron thing.
404015	404655	Oh, I know.
404735	406397	We talked about that briefly on last week's show.
406417	407117	That's amazing.
407137	407858	It makes me all kinds of happy.
408851	415036	Also, the new trailers show Steamboat Willie is going to be another level that's in that, as well as Lilo and Stitch.
415797	416577	Yep, I saw that.
416637	419840	Actually, I knew that because they had it at the E3 demo.
422222	423243	You've got Stitch there.
423823	428287	But I also played a good bit of it at E3, too, because I have all my pictures up.
428347	429448	The game just looks sexy.
429508	430209	That's all it is.
431250	435233	And it's out on Japanese sites.
435313	435814	There's the...
436815	463498	the demo reel for Final Fantasy 12 which is looking pretty hot some folks here have that now because Dragon Quest 8 I haven't gotten to check it out myself yet but I've heard it's pretty darn good too bad the game might be getting delayed again you know that's a rumor going around right now that the game's getting delayed again not surprising they said for sure March 2006 in Japan but now they're saying maybe not we'll see well
463993	471747	The thing about the Final Fantasy games I've noticed though is that the US versions are almost always worth waiting for because they add more stuff.
472589	473130	Yeah, a little bit.
473210	476556	And then it gets re-released as an international version and blah blah blah blah.
477287	485792	What I'm kind of waiting for, you know, and this is really, every time I see Kingdom Hearts 2, I keep thinking, you know, back to Super Mario RPG.
486472	491155	That was one of the coolest things where you have Square teaming up with Nintendo to make a really kick-ass RPG.
491215	498399	They really need to do that again, just with all their franchises, kind of make a new RPG and make it really cool.
499279	501321	Paper Mario is no excuse for an RPG.
501381	503702	This is not a sequel to the Super Mario RPG.
503802	505243	It's a poor excuse, is what it is.
506665	507986	I don't know, that's what I'm waiting for.
508527	509467	I'll keep waiting, I'm sure.
510268	512069	We need Smash Bros.
512109	513169	Final Fantasy Edition.
515190	517131	You guys have some crazy combinations.
517152	518032	We already got Urgot.
518692	519213	Oh, that's true.
520313	522775	No, no, no, that's just Final Fantasy VII.
523655	526417	We need full-on Smash Bros.
526437	529779	style with different lock and line.
530319	530699	Rydia.
531660	531860	Yeah.
532691	533112	Absolutely.
533372	534673	Alright, My Gaming Week.
535634	538317	Let's see, I also have been playing an awful lot of Mario Kart DS.
538377	539458	It really is that good.
539578	542301	I haven't been into a Mario Kart game probably since maybe the 64.
543462	547286	Really so much though, the Super Nintendo one is really where the old schoolness is at.
547586	548026	I love it.
548847	550649	And I love this new one for the DS.
550789	553492	You know, for some reason the GameCube one, the formula was just off.
553532	554593	I didn't care for the GameCube one.
555153	555334	And the
556448	559409	Game Boy One that they had previous, it wasn't the same.
559769	560289	It really wasn't.
560329	561829	I don't know what to say, but it wasn't the same.
562189	563130	But this one is great.
563550	566931	It controls pretty good considering it's got the D-pad and everything.
568031	569611	And the game runs great.
569651	570852	It's a very simple engine.
571552	574733	It plays much like it was the old Super Nintendo One, and I love that.
574753	576713	I love the fact that they included the retro tracks.
577213	578533	The wireless features are great.
578573	580134	And the fact that it goes online...
580734	581915	Thanks for watching!
599506	606289	We're hearing, at least we kind of got word this week, that Nintendo is banning you from sharing your friend code on their forums.
606689	609210	You're not allowed on Nintendo's forums to actually share your own friend code.
609850	615913	And I think the reason why they're trying to do that is they're wanting to make sure that people on your friends list are actually your friends.
616013	619815	And not that they could stop me from posting on another forum, but I think that's very interesting.
619975	622836	They are really, really being careful with this online stuff.
622856	626457	Like, they don't want to have that story in the news about, you know...
628158	632621	Little Girl meets Old Pervert on Nintendo Game and on Animal Crossing.
632641	636683	Yeah, I was going to say, well, in Mario Kart, they can't really communicate anyway, so it's like retarded.
636703	642127	That's what I thought was weird, because you can't really communicate in Mario Kart anyway, which is kind of one of its downfalls, is that you can't do anything.
642167	645349	You can't use the microphone to chat, you can't write, talk, or anything.
645389	647090	Oh my god, that would be so bad.
647130	647670	Yeah, but...
647850	648711	and so on.
669551	670231	Animal Crossing.
670291	673293	Maybe we'll see that front end for the Wi-Fi be a little better.
673553	676875	My peeve with that game is the whole battle mode.
677075	677575	I don't get it.
678075	678916	I don't get it at all.
679136	682137	And I love the battle mode in the Super Nintendo game.
682197	685519	I love the battle mode in the Nintendo 64 game.
686940	688981	I just... I didn't get it with GameCube.
689561	692723	Their battle mode was crap because their arenas were crap.
693083	696384	And I don't even think the Game Boy Advance version had battle mode.
696885	697045	But...
698416	701937	It's just, this one's pretty cool, I just don't get how they blow up the other balloons.
702258	707840	My other minor minor bitch besides that would be maybe some of the other mechanics in the actual racing.
707880	715243	It does seem like it favors, and I know that Mario Kart is supposed to do this, where like if you're in last place you get the really good items, and when you're in first place you get the not so great items.
715663	717484	It seems to really favor...
718084	719025	Like, last place.
719065	719726	Like, over first place.
719746	720626	Like, almost too much.
720666	721627	Like, it's kind of skewed.
722028	724009	Again, though, that's a real minor, minor complaint.
724189	726631	I still highly, highly recommend Mario Kart DS.
726672	727552	I think it's a great title.
728093	730495	Especially if you've loved any of the other Mario Kart titles.
730795	732076	So I give it my highest recommendation.
733277	734799	Also, what I got to play this week.
734859	736260	Dance Dance Revolution Ultramix 3.
736920	739342	Of course, Orange Lines Radio started all about music video games.
739362	741524	So, of course, I have to check out all the new ones when they come out.
741925	743146	DDR Ultramix 3.
744087	744427	My only...
745189	745850	It's a good game.
745890	746811	It's a solid game.
746931	748993	I do recommend it for fans of DDR.
749073	755338	For people that are just getting into it, I can only give it about a borderline recommendation because I think DDR Ultramix 2 was better.
755699	758021	I think the formula for how they were picking the songs was better.
758601	761183	And it's kind of one of those things where it's like, if it ain't broke, don't fix it.
761684	764927	And Konami kind of really went crazy with some of their song picks.
764947	766168	They have some like
766943	770185	Stuff that sounds like... I don't even know.
770505	775407	They're trying to do homages to these bands, but does that mean that they're good stuff to dance to?
775928	776348	I don't know.
776548	780750	See, I think they made some really odd picks, like Ray Charles and The Clash and stuff.
780790	784732	I mean, although those are great songs, I don't think they make for good DDR songs.
785053	787914	So that kind of ruins the game for me in that aspect.
787954	795318	And plus, just the fact that the song packs that you bought on Ultramix 2 do not function correctly, not all the songs work right...
795798	796258	Ultramix 3
825552	827973	But first, let's get to some gaming news.
828553	830714	And I'll go ahead and let DarkSakura start off.
830735	833916	DarkSakura, we love Katamari.
834396	837398	And I understand you got some news about the next creation of Katamari.
838558	841059	Actually, it's called Me and My Katamari.
841179	842360	I think that's a cute name.
843781	844041	Okay.
845982	852025	Looking at the pictures that are online right now, the game looks actually very fabulous.
852065	854726	I mean, it looks top-notch for the PSP.
855678	862944	However, the control, from what I understand, though, is supposed to be pretty much crappy.
864145	867947	And I can understand that without having both analog on it.
871490	879176	I mean, imagine you're going from a game where basically you've got two-handed control to trying to control it with one hand.
879236	880417	It's not going to work.
880797	884100	So are they going to do it with the one analog and the buttons, or what are they going to do?
885503	886583	I've seen too much into it.
886683	890604	However, there are some good features that I think might make up for that.
891605	892725	Like what?
892885	894566	Wireless play for up to four people.
895566	895986	Cool.
897006	899447	You've got the prince and the cousins.
899547	900527	There's old and new.
901728	909550	You've got customization options, more masks, more headgear, the ability to wear them various places.
911396	918298	A new island interface that highlights players, your options and different stages represented by animals, needs, and new homes.
920218	928520	There's actually, the information for it is up at katamari.namco.com Okay.
929701	939883	But there's also photos up on this, actually quite a number of photos at worthplaying.com
940731	947978	Which actually was, this particular link was also emailed to us by one of our listeners.
949380	949640	Awesome.
949660	953004	Well, thank you, listener, for sharing the alias developments on me and my Kamari.
954045	969019	Me and my Katamari, now we know what they're officially going to call it here in the U.S., because previously we just knew My My Katamari was like the Japanese translation, so it's kind of nice to hear that it's going to have a name here in the U.S.
969039	971621	that actually makes a little more sense, so that's nice to hear.
972282	972562	All right.
973281	975943	Um, moving on, I got another story for you guys.
976503	980605	Um, and this has to do with, um, World of Warcraft.
981026	983807	Um, as you know, um, it's released into other countries now.
983847	986849	It just recently went over into, uh, Asia, other parts of there.
987389	990491	Um, what's interesting, the game rolled out in China not that long ago.
991071	994412	And unfortunately, they've had a bit of an incident there.
994792	1002715	A 13-year-old Chinese boy actually jumped to their death from a 24-story building from playing too much World of Warcraft.
1002755	1004656	Now, that's not the new thing, okay?
1004696	1006196	That happened after it rolled out last year.
1006256	1007497	That actually happened last year.
1007837	1008797	This is the new part.
1009097	1018641	The parents of the boy are now suing Blizzard, saying they actually got a lawyer and, quote, internet game addiction researcher.
1019574	1023915	and they are filing the suits upon the whole game industry on behalf of parents.
1025256	1025756	Interesting.
1025836	1030138	The question is, how liable should game companies be when their kids OD on the gaming?
1030238	1033299	Does World of Warcraft feature jumping out of buildings?
1034219	1034359	No.
1034379	1036240	I don't know if that's what they're saying so much.
1036280	1039060	Which is how it forced some kid to jump out of a building?
1039281	1040741	Because he was addicted to a game?
1041981	1043802	Okay, I don't see how that works.
1044222	1046483	If I'm addicted to alcohol, I don't jump out of a window.
1048408	1049388	I go drink more alcohol.
1049769	1050069	Okay.
1051510	1051951	I don't get it.
1053572	1053832	Alright.
1055174	1059738	So, just kind of, I don't know, it's too bad.
1060338	1066944	But it's interesting to hear that the lawsuit crazy stuff doesn't just happen in the US, because that story is coming out of China.
1067325	1068546	So, go figure.
1068962	1069923	Loki, you got something for us?
1071123	1073025	Those crazy Chinese and their games.
1073405	1074946	They're always killing somebody.
1074966	1076246	Well, you have something related to that?
1076487	1077107	No, I don't.
1078988	1080009	I sort of, I guess.
1081089	1090915	Well, this year's Spike Awards, or their video game awards, the results have been posted because we like to spoil everybody's...
1092298	1094279	Game of the Year, Resident Evil 4 Best Action Game, God of War
1105006	1105767	No surprise there.
1106527	1110009	Um, best sports title, of course, Tony Hawk's American Wasteland.
1110770	1113231	Um, and then they have some really strange stuff.
1113411	1115113	Best cyber vixen of the year.
1115933	1119315	Um, some chick from 007 from Russia with Love.
1119856	1126400	Uh, one that I thought was pretty cool, um, was best, um, soundtrack.
1126500	1131783	Well, they have Guitar Hero as best soundtrack, but best original score, We Love Katamari, which is really cool.
1132744	1132824	Um,
1134637	1141100	What's kind of interesting is they have a whole bunch of games winning awards that aren't even out yet.
1141600	1145081	Like Peter Jackson's King Kong, the official game of the movie.
1145501	1146262	It's not out yet.
1146442	1147002	What did it win?
1147662	1156005	It won, let's see here, Best Performance by a Human Male, Debbie Jack Black in Peter Jackson's King Kong.
1157006	1160887	It also won, let's see here, Best Cast.
1161533	1162394	Best handheld game, Luminous
1181769	1182730	which I thought was pretty cool.
1182850	1183390	Well deserved.
1183790	1189314	Now, Resident Evil 4 being the game of the year there, I think I could see that.
1189354	1201102	You know, it may not be my favorite game this year, but damn, it was a real sharp looking game, really innovated and just the graphics were amazing and I could see Resident Evil 4 walking away with that.
1201863	1207687	It makes more sense to me than some of the other awards that I see shows give for game of the year sometimes, so...
1208613	1209373	I'm okay with that.
1209754	1210774	What were some of the other nominees?
1210814	1211594	Did they list the nominees?
1211614	1213195	Because I forget.
1213495	1214755	Who were the other nominees for Game of the Year?
1215096	1221038	We also have some other Best Supporting Male Performance, Christopher Walken in True Crime, New York City.
1221118	1228381	And of course, also Best Supporting Female Performance, also won by Tracy Lourdes in True Crime, New York City.
1228581	1229061	Go figure.
1229221	1230762	Alright, what were the other nominees for Game of the Year?
1231102	1235544	Game of the Year, the other nominees, we had God of War, definitely deserving.
1236857	1239539	Call of Duty 2, also a very deserving game.
1239599	1241760	World of Warcraft, also very deserving.
1241900	1242460	And Fear.
1244361	1245162	All very good games.
1245262	1248103	See, I'm kind of surprised World of Warcraft didn't walk away with it, honestly.
1248124	1250665	Just with all the people that are just sickly obsessed with that game.
1250705	1256208	But Resident Evil 4, I'm not going to say that I necessarily think World of Warcraft is a better game, but Resident Evil 4, I can see that.
1256428	1257529	That's a pretty solid list.
1257569	1258029	I'll give it to them.
1258049	1258630	They've got a good list.
1258890	1259670	Well, let me put it this way.
1259690	1261451	It's a lot better than, say, GeForce.
1261891	1265033	I disagree with Resident Evil 4.
1265293	1265554	Really?
1265594	1266214	What would you have put?
1267654	1270896	I honestly would have gone with World of Warcraft or God of War.
1271276	1273318	Why were you not so big on Resident Evil 4?
1274379	1285446	Well, if you've followed the series, it's actually such a departure from the rest of the series that, I don't know, as a game it was great, but it wasn't Resident Evil.
1286306	1288568	But if they'd called it something else, would you have been okay with it?
1289408	1290089	Possibly.
1290109	1294252	It would have been like, hi, we're pretending to be a zombie game without zombies, then yeah.
1294272	1294792	Yeah.
1295905	1296245	All right.
1296765	1301107	Well, you heard me talking earlier in the show about DDR Ultramix 3, which was released last week.
1301427	1310651	One of the biggest gambles that Konami took was in shaking up the song list with a variety and eclectic mix of music, everything from rap to rock to synth to classic Spanish music.
1311012	1315153	They didn't neglect some of the things that worked for them in last year's DDR Ultramix 2, however.
1315574	1321976	One of the songs in DDR Ultramix 2 that got a great reception from the fans was In My Eyes, as remixed by Midihead.
1322337	1324998	Well, Midihead is back in this year's DDR Ultramix 3,
1325658	1326959	I am sorry, I'm so sorry, it was a...
1342509	1351556	Downing some Pepsi One at the moment Suddenly I thought I was reintroducing DarkSakura Because that's usually how she introduces herself Oh no, you mean this has already been done?
1351596	1369889	Yeah, you two are going to have to have a contest someday I don't know what's up with that Oh jeez Alright, well, first thing I want to know about You know, your song in Ultramix 2 was so well received by the fans How long did it take Konami to say Hey, we've got to bring him back for Ultramix 3 It took him a couple of months to see the light, man
1370629	1372210	Just a couple of months.
1372670	1379454	Do you think that's one of the reasons why you got brought back is because the fans, do you think they noticed that, that the fans had such a great feedback to the last time?
1380595	1381496	It was all the fans.
1381816	1386519	I don't think they would have called me back if the fans hadn't demanded the MIDI head.
1387459	1387980	Well, awesome.
1388000	1389160	Well, congratulations.
1389400	1392582	That's great to go from one song to three songs that you contributed to.
1392622	1393483	That's great.
1393743	1396845	Yeah, now next time, now this is a total secret, of course.
1396965	1397245	Okay.
1397305	1399707	Next time, this is for your listeners only.
1399827	1400107	All right.
1401321	1407145	For the next game, it's going to be MidiHeads Dance Dance Revolution Ultra Mix 4.
1408186	1408486	That's it.
1408546	1410888	It's going to be Dance Dance Revolution MidiHeads Mix.
1410968	1414411	That's it.
1414811	1418674	I would rather dance to a mix made up completely of MidiHeads songs.
1418754	1423097	I'll tell you what, some of the songs they picked for this last mix, because they picked some really weird stuff.
1423117	1423498	Stop it.
1423638	1424999	You're making me blush.
1427305	1434909	This time, one of your original songs, because most people know you for your remixes, but now one of your original tracks, Raise Your Hands, actually shows up in the game.
1435230	1440253	Did you get to suggest this, or did Konami actually listen to your album and pick something, or how did that happen?
1441093	1447077	Well, actually, I just sent them a CD full of stuff after I did the In My Eyes remix.
1448037	1450779	And I said, you know, guys, I also have
1451340	1452161	Some of my own music.
1452541	1458626	And so they were surprised to get it and listen to it and actually hear that I have some talent in me.
1458706	1465332	And they decided that that was the song that was going in the next game.
1465560	1466120	Well, awesome.
1466240	1467561	It works really well for the game.
1467601	1472984	I don't know if you've had a chance to see it in the game yet, but the cut and everything works really well, and the video's kind of cool, too.
1473185	1474065	Well, it should, man.
1474105	1478228	I do crunches and sit-ups to that thing.
1478308	1479909	Actually, I don't think they put you in the video.
1479929	1481690	I think they hired some dancers to be in it.
1483030	1485812	Yeah, I'm a little too overweight for their taste.
1485852	1486533	That's all right.
1487993	1489454	So are most of the people playing the game.
1489494	1489815	Come on.
1489935	1490395	I'm just kidding.
1491147	1491968	I need to get the game.
1491988	1492990	You know what's funny?
1493110	1493972	This is what's funny.
1495454	1499120	I've done all this work for Konami, and I have yet to get the game.
1500062	1501624	They haven't hooked me up with the game.
1501744	1503688	They haven't sent you a copy of the game?
1503728	1505490	They're going to make me go out and buy it.
1506407	1508968	I know people from Konami listen to this show.
1509028	1510688	Konami, send him the game.
1510868	1511468	He earned it.
1511789	1512089	People.
1512169	1515850	Of course, I need an Xbox, too, then, at that time.
1515870	1516930	Well, they should send you all that stuff.
1516970	1523692	Anyway, well, here's another thing I'm curious about is that, okay, your music did so well that you're in DR Ultramix 3 three times.
1524072	1530534	I don't even know if you know about this yet, but did you know that one of your songs is crossing over into a game that Konami is putting out in Japan?
1530554	1531634	What?
1532945	1534248	Oh my goodness!
1534669	1535971	You're kidding me!
1536091	1537474	No, I would hope... I knew, I knew, I knew.
1537494	1538616	I was going to say, I hope you got paid for it.
1538636	1540279	You guys announced it on your website.
1541812	1542292	David Hasselhoff
1568528	1577477	I'm going to be the next David Hasselhoff of Japan.
1578618	1579338	How did that happen?
1579378	1581861	Did they tell you they were interested in doing this?
1581901	1582742	How did that all go down?
1583382	1584864	No, they don't tell me anything.
1584924	1585384	Are you kidding me?
1585404	1586325	They just do what they want.
1586906	1589208	They've paid me and done away with me.
1593868	1596189	They have full right to circulate that as they please.
1596449	1601052	Well, you know, a lot of the fans were saying that you should be in Beatmania as well, and now that's happening.
1601092	1604413	So, you know, they're definitely listening to the fans over on some of the boards.
1604473	1610436	Yeah, I think that's one thing I've got to give to Konami Hawaii is the fact that they do listen to their fans.
1610957	1616059	And that is to be well-respected.
1616299	1619101	That doesn't happen a lot in this industry.
1620694	1621295	Absolutely.
1621395	1628519	So kudos to Konami for actually reading and getting a pulse for what's going on on the message boards out there and giving us what we want, usually.
1628999	1629300	All right.
1630020	1635743	Well, we're lucky enough to actually have a copy of Jelly Kiss Midi Head Smack Mix, so we're going to go ahead and play it for you guys right now.
1637084	1638725	I'll keep my voice alive
1715167	1720824	My boy, I just gotta let you know that I know that I'm not gonna die
1742438	1746441	Alright, that was Midihead's smack mix of Jelly Kiss here on Orange Lounge Radio To Go.
1746701	1749183	We're joined still with the remixer himself, Midihead.
1749443	1754846	A little later in the program, we'll be bringing you one of his original tunes from DDR Ultramix 3, Raise Your Hands.
1755247	1763772	And if you want to check out more information on Midihead's music, check out his website, www.midihead.com.
1764613	1765954	Not meaty head.
1765994	1767735	Yeah, not meaty head or...
1769937	1784948	One other thing you've actually been doing on MidiHead.com, you actually, for the past couple months, you put out a couple podcasts of your own that were available on your website, and they were kind of teasing Dance Dance Revolution, Ultra Mix 3, and kind of playing, hey, here's some of my songs that are going to be in the game.
1785289	1790092	Here's some of the other artists that are going to be in the game, kind of teasing us with what was going to be in the game.
1790372	1792534	Are you going to continue to do this, even though the game's out?
1792554	1795016	Are you thinking that podcasting is something you want to keep doing?
1796354	1798097	I don't know, to be quite honest.
1799359	1802203	It's a lot of time, as you know, to put those things together.
1804766	1805728	If I continue to get...
1806229	1810992	The feedback that I've been getting from all the fans, then I don't really see any reason to discontinue it.
1812133	1814295	After all, we've got to give them what they want, right, Rob?
1814515	1815175	Yeah, exactly.
1815195	1816396	We've got to make those fans happy.
1816636	1817036	Absolutely.
1817076	1821920	You know, one thing I think they'd want is to keep knowing what's going on in the world of Konami with all their games.
1821960	1825882	Do you think Konami would be good to you and let you be their voice?
1826983	1835289	Well, you know, it's one of those concepts that certainly we're trying out right now.
1835860	1856172	and I can't tell you how much dialogue I've had with Konami about it, but it's gone all the way up to corporate and we've discussed the benefits of having an artist kind of mingle a little bit more with the fans.
1857113	1861015	So in this form, it seems to be doing just fine.
1861055	1864217	I just need to find the time to do more podcasts.
1864822	1875986	I think if I continue doing them at the rate that I've been doing them, which is like every other month, it won't burn people out, and it won't burn me out.
1876046	1877327	Well, we'll see what happens with that.
1877367	1880028	Good luck to you in whatever you decide to do with future podcasts.
1880468	1892552	Now, you know I've got to ask you this, because we're a video gaming-related show, and I know you said earlier in the program you haven't gotten a chance to play DDR Ultimate 3 yet, but I'm curious, are there any other video games that you're into?
1892612	1893833	What kind of video games do you like to play?
1895270	1899911	Well, I gotta say I have this really sick habit of firing up Urban Terror.
1900871	1902571	And I know I've mentioned that before.
1903452	1904652	It's a Quake 3 mod.
1905652	1909013	And I play it a little more than I really should.
1909633	1910893	Are you looking forward to Quake 4?
1912253	1912774	Quake 4?
1912814	1913734	Yeah.
1913774	1924376	You know, Rob, I have to say that although I used to play a lot more video games in my time, I don't find a lot of time to dive into...
1925296	1928520	as much first-person shooterism as I'd like to.
1928720	1941916	You know, it's good, though, to remind our listeners that there is a real world out there outside of video games that sometimes involves work, working two or three jobs, kids and life and house and payments, and I think I've pretty much summed it up.
1942756	1944277	Enjoy youth while it lasts, kiddies.
1944537	1945378	Right, you bet.
1945438	1947078	You better enjoy youth while it lasts.
1947098	1948699	Well, that one spawned off of the remix of In My Eyes.
1970569	1975691	Spawned off a phone call and there I am.
1975892	1981054	Should I just tell him this exciting story about how I was laying dying in my
1994494	1999977	Hospital bed after knee surgery and they cut a main artery and I was bleeding to death and overcame D.M.
2000017	2000817	Ashera.
2000977	2001637	Was it D.M.
2001677	2002398	Ashera?
2003738	2004799	Yeah.
2004979	2009021	So he's the one that actually contacted you behind this game.
2010582	2014704	We don't know much about the game, so we're trying to figure out little bits and pieces wherever we can.
2014764	2021387	And if hospital bed, leg amputee, be it, then that's all we know so far.
2023457	2025659	I was getting out of control now.
2026739	2030602	Alright, well, back to a more serious story.
2032443	2038227	I bet probably a year and a half ago you probably didn't think that you would be so involved with video games as you are now.
2038428	2038828	I don't know.
2039308	2039789	Is that true?
2039929	2043211	Of course I knew I was going to be involved in video games.
2043271	2043831	Are you kidding me?
2043851	2047214	I paint my entire destiny for them.
2048335	2050376	No, I actually...
2052605	2056186	Video games was something that I had planned on doing eventually.
2056406	2058407	I just didn't know when it was going to happen.
2058807	2067209	Everything I do in my musical avenues, I always try to leave as many doors open when I'm doing stuff.
2067449	2068010	And here I am.
2068230	2070870	So do you have future plans to continue working with video games?
2071571	2073091	Well, if the money's there, yeah.
2073151	2073691	Are you kidding me?
2076272	2077852	That sums it up, everybody.
2077872	2079573	We'll go where the money's at, won't we?
2080643	2082583	I gotta pay for my house, man.
2082603	2083884	I live in Southern California.
2084144	2084684	Oh, ouch.
2085864	2089765	Alright, well, Middyhead, that's about all the time we have, but thanks so much for being on the show today.
2089825	2090585	We appreciate it.
2090745	2101207	Once again, guys, check it out, www.mittyhead.com if you're interested in Middyhead and he's got his own music there that you can download and the forums and his podcast.
2101227	2104288	It's just an action-packed site, so check it out, everybody.
2104328	2105788	Thanks so much, Middyhead, for being on the show.
2106368	2108049	Yeah, you're welcome, dude.
2108349	2108889	Alright.
2109269	2110149	Yay, Middyhead!
2110615	2112037	Let's move on to another story.
2112898	2113859	We're going to talk about this.
2113899	2118625	This is a rumor that's out right now is that a Zelda movie is on the way out.
2119346	2126235	I don't know about this, but this came out of Club Nintendo, which is a Mexican publication that's very similar to Nintendo Power.
2127216	2127577	It was...
2128798	2138761	Reggie Phil's Aim was the guy at Nintendo that actually talked to this magazine about it, saying that they want to do Metroid, and then Zelda would be next in line.
2139041	2149744	But the weird thing about this is that I thought that John Woo got the rights to Metroid, but this is indicating that Nintendo actually somehow bought this back, and I didn't know that that had happened.
2150364	2150584	So...
2151989	2153950	I wouldn't trust it unless it's official Nintendo
2174753	2176955	I don't know, because the games are so freaking phenomenal.
2176975	2180637	Of course, Metroid's great too, but I don't know.
2180717	2182799	Zelda seems like one of those things where it's already a movie.
2183039	2184280	We don't need another movie.
2184940	2186561	If they did, they would have to do it right.
2187162	2188303	Well, I would hope they would.
2189003	2189303	All right.
2190244	2196028	Jamie, you had another story for us about one of the Xbox 360 launch games might be kind of buggy.
2196068	2196689	What's going on with this?
2197609	2204234	Well, Rare has stated that they took a very big risk with Perfect Dark Zero.
2205020	2207141	so that it would be released on launch day.
2207781	2219487	They said typically it goes through a certification process to finish it up and then it's released to be manufactured, but they've gone ahead and released it to manufacturing without it going through their certification process.
2219787	2224149	They actually said they gave the go-ahead five days before the game certification.
2225209	2225589	Wow.
2225609	2233713	And if their certification doesn't pass, it's actually quoted here that they would have hundreds of thousands of discs on their hands.
2234693	2237575	That is a huge risk because that's a big penalty.
2237876	2239557	I know Microsoft is huge.
2239877	2242039	All the game companies really are is huge on those.
2242079	2244000	You know, everything's got to be right and certified.
2244040	2246582	That is a huge risk you're taking there.
2246963	2251326	I guess Rare kind of working directly with Microsoft can get away with it a little more.
2251366	2253868	But that's crazy.
2254168	2256190	I hope the game makes it or we're all in trouble.
2256727	2265411	Well, it's also stated on there, though, that Rare puts a lot of work into polishing the game, so they're sure that it's going to be okay.
2265651	2268893	But they've produced 700,000 copies for the U.S.
2269553	2269953	Wow.
2270354	2275196	So that every person who has an Xbox 360 will also have that title.
2275736	2276836	Now we know how many are coming out.
2276856	2280797	Well, that's their estimate.
2281257	2282077	That's the estimate.
2282217	2286258	Well, I would think that they would know what they're talking about as soon as they have to communicate directly with Microsoft.
2286458	2291159	Hey, wait, Microsoft, you said that we're only getting... But that doesn't mean we're getting 700,000 of them on Tuesday.
2291259	2294320	That just means they're making 700,000 of them for the first run.
2295340	2296500	First run, first launch.
2297000	2301481	That also, though, explains why the game hasn't been available for review by some place.
2301857	2306218	Speaking of which, by the way, not only that, we've got more problems with Perfect Dark Zero.
2306238	2313200	It was supposed to be out on Friday, but apparently they're having trouble getting it to the United States because it has to ship from China now.
2313240	2319221	They're running way behind schedule to delay it to launch day instead of before launch day, which was interesting.
2319361	2322222	And we're not even sure if it's going to be there on launch day either.
2322862	2325043	So that's probably why you can't find it in stores right now either.
2325803	2326203	Interesting.
2326463	2328764	Well, if anything, then if it's having to go from...
2330339	2331980	Joanna Dark does not feature jumping.
2359335	2360356	She cannot jump.
2361497	2362657	Well, what good is she then?
2363938	2365099	Hey, as long as she's got boobs.
2366220	2366280	Hey.
2366360	2366900	Just kidding.
2367421	2367721	All right.
2368341	2379069	Speaking of the Xbox 360, now, the other week we were talking about the backwards compatibility and how there's like 200 games that are going to be backwards compatible here in the U.S., and people are saying, that's not enough, that's not enough.
2379349	2380169	Well, guess what, kids?
2380229	2386434	Be thankful you don't live in Japan, because guess how many games are going to be backwards compatible at launch in Japan?
2387568	2389310	12.
2388249	2389310	That's it, 12.
2389650	2394995	Now they promised they'll be adding more and more, but all you're getting the first run through is 12.
2395715	2407846	Now granted, these are probably some of the biggest games, Halo, Halo 2, Ninja Gaiden, Rainbow Six, Crimson Skies, Fable, and then of course, Simpsons Hit and Run is just randomly in there too.
2408615	2409455	Xbox Live Arcade
2432566	2437328	and they have a ton of stuff out there going to be available for you to download.
2437968	2442250	But they've actually released what they're going to be releasing initially.
2443250	2451774	For old retro games, they've got Gauntlet, Robotron, as well as Joust, which will be really cool.
2453674	2455615	Smash TV, which I thought was really neat.
2456556	2459017	Then, of course, my favorite, which is going to be...
2461058	2461578	Hectix, Bejeweled 2
2475546	2481628	and then, of course, my favorite, Geometry Wars Retro Evolved, which seems to be everybody's favorite out there.
2482048	2483048	Those are going to be available.
2483268	2485769	Most of the games are actually going to be available for either $5 to $10.
2486229	2489550	Geometry Wars and some of the better ones are actually going to be $5.
2489610	2490611	A few of them are going to be $10.
2492391	2495052	Some Billiards game is $15 for download.
2495132	2496253	Ooh, it's a top-shelf game.
2496273	2498434	It's all about Smash TV, though.
2498814	2501696	Smash TV, though, I think that was one of the ones that's $5, which is cool.
2502496	2503516	Well, I would hope so.
2503536	2505077	It has the best quotes in it.
2505417	2511300	But considering you can buy it as part of a $20 pack with 20 games, it's really only worth a dollar.
2511320	2515082	Considering I already owe three copies of it and the meme, I mean...
2515615	2516095	All right, all right.
2516135	2517015	But here's the cool thing, though.
2517035	2519576	At least they do have free demos you can try out.
2519676	2521537	So you can try these games before you buy them.
2522157	2522717	That's nice.
2523458	2530680	They're going to have free demos for other games, like Need for Speed and Most Wanted are going to be on there, as well as some of the other EA games and stuff.
2531080	2531740	That's kind of cool.
2531840	2534881	And, of course, more gamer tags you can purchase and all that stuff.
2535141	2536422	A lot of ways to waste your money.
2536662	2537362	All right.
2538242	2540083	We are all about wasting time and money.
2541027	2550591	You don't want to waste all your money on video games, though, because, you know, if you spent all your days playing video games, you'd have no time to go out and spend your money on strippers, like Loki did this past week, right, Loki?
2551131	2551811	That was yesterday.
2551831	2568298	Yeah, anyway, so here to always remind us that there is a real life outside of gaming is the one and only DarkSakura, and it's been a couple weeks since she's been able to give you a piece of her advice, so here it is, DarkSakura's advice column, and DarkSakura, what are you going to be talking to us about tonight?
2569258	2572920	Today's bit of advice is how to leap from a motorcycle to a car.
2575121	2572920	1.
2575562	2578083	Make sure the vehicles are moving at the same speed.
2578103	2578083	2.
2580124	2585988	Wait for a long straight section of road before positioning the vehicles as close as possible to each other.
2586488	2591211	You will be on the passenger side of the car, so you will be very close to the edge of the roadway.
2592492	2591211	3.
2592932	2597995	Crouch with both of your feet on the running board or the seat and hold the throttle until the last instant.
2598547	2601889	Remember, as soon as you release the throttle, the bike speed will decrease.
2602910	2601889	4.
2603611	2607153	If the car has an inside handle above the door, grab it.
2607453	2610575	If not, simply time the leap so your torso lands in the car.
2611076	2613517	If you miss the window, tuck and roll away from the vehicles.
2614738	2613517	5.
2615198	2617980	Have the driver swerve away from the bike as soon as you re inside.
2618241	2621403	The bike may slip under the rear passenger side wheel of the car.
2622063	2623684	But my final piece of advice?
2623864	2624125	Yes.
2627377	2629758	Don't try jumping into a car while it's moving.
2629778	2630419	That's stupid.
2632379	2633700	Or at least tell the guy to stop.
2635241	2636321	Just shoot him first.
2636461	2636841	I don't know.
2638602	2639002	Alright.
2639182	2649007	That's why you shoot the tires and then throw the guy out of the car and then drive off somewhere where you can change the tire.
2650668	2650988	Alright.
2651288	2652188	That's much easier.
2652388	2653189	Much easier.
2653569	2655730	For the love of God, don't tell him you saw it in a video game.
2657048	2658669	Yeah, don't tell... No, no, no, no.
2659169	2662411	Tell them that you saw it on the edited GTA 3.
2662971	2669594	Speaking of which, Pursuit Force is available for purchase for the PSP coming this spring.
2670575	2673936	I didn't want to say the words Jack Thompson, but what you said kind of made me think of that.
2673996	2678038	I heard he got, like, booted off that case in Alabama or something, and the judge yelled at him or something.
2678138	2679579	I might be kind of... He didn't get booted.
2679619	2680359	He quit.
2681060	2681340	I didn't.
2681360	2682060	That's not what I read.
2682120	2682741	He's a big loser.
2683181	2683441	Oh, well.
2683641	2687324	No, I'm just amused by his Amazon rating.
2687364	2691447	What is it, 37,000 on Amazon's list?
2691527	2692948	Don't give him a free plug.
2692968	2698132	Hey, speaking of which, people that like the Jack Thompson book also recommend gay porno books as well.
2698773	2699113	Really?
2699313	2699674	Really.
2702396	2703076	That's an insult.
2703176	2706219	I'm just making fun of him because he's a loser.
2706359	2711623	He does nothing but embarrass himself, so I think he's a good point of humor.
2712136	2714658	Gay pornography can at least be artistic sometimes.
2715778	2717319	Jack Thompson's work, never artistic.
2719741	2721141	Let's talk about The Matrix Online.
2721182	2722903	Loki, this was a game you played for about, what, three days?
2724536	2729058	I thought this game was shut down!
2729159	2731139	No, it's saying that the Matrix Online is still going.
2731360	2735302	They did a server consolidation, I think, but they didn't shut it down.
2736062	2744906	Anyway, they are doing another update, it's update number 38, and they're going to be doing in-game advertising, courtesy of Massive.
2744946	2749188	We'll be doing the in-game advertising using the billboards.
2750669	2762653	They kind of already do some real world product advertising, but now they're going to do stuff, you know, that's bought advertising because the advertising they had before was for like, let's say the clothing was used in the game.
2762773	2764494	They'd give that clothing company free advertising.
2764974	2768455	So now they're going to do, I guess, selling for the advertising, whatever.
2769776	2774217	And that those ads will be refreshing and updating with pretty good frequency in the game there.
2774317	2775918	So very interesting.
2777194	2780958	I'm just kind of surprised that the game still has such a large following.
2781698	2783300	Seeing as they killed off all the characters.
2783320	2796012	Yeah, I don't want to bash on Matrix Online, because it seemed alright, and I can see where people get into it, because it does continue the Matrix story, but I don't know, it doesn't have that same play me, play me, over and over again like some of the other MMOs do.
2796032	2796872	I don't know.
2797313	2798454	I enjoy the Matrix games.
2798494	2799735	Ragnarok Online!
2799755	2802778	Not just Ragnarok, but Final Fantasy, Warcraft, hell anything!
2804601	2813486	For all those people who are willing to play the sort of mindless rounds of PSO, and yes, I was one of them.
2814047	2816848	It has its addictions.
2818009	2822592	DarkSakura, what do you have considering release dates in the UK?
2823912	2825413	I have quite a few.
2827274	2833458	What we're looking at so far, we have Call of Cthulhu, Dark Corners of the Earth, which I'm interested in.
2834161	2840624	Bubble Bobble Revolution on the DS Crash Tag Team Racing for the PSP Is this all this week?
2841765	2862735	The 25th Dr. Mario and Puzzle League on the GBA Dragon Ball Z Super Sonic Warriors 2 Gun Kirby Canvas Curse on the DS Mario Kart DS also on the 25th Need for Speed Most Wanted Pro Evolution Soccer 5 Psychonauts Rugby Challenge 2006
2864158	2872544	Sega Classics Collection, Ski Racing 2006, Tales of Eternia, The Incredibles Rise of the Underminer, and Touch Golf.
2873525	2889377	Also to be announced, we have Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, and Pac-Man World 3, a few other things coming out, Snowboard Kids DS, those are all scheduled to be out sometime this month, we just don't have a date on it.
2890091	2890431	Awesome.
2890672	2890932	All right.
2890972	2892313	That for our friends over in the UK.
2892373	2895636	And here in the US, I don't have a calendar in front of me for the US, but...
2896525	2900286	Everything's all about the 360 this next week, and that's what a lot of people have been talking about.
2900306	2903807	But there's been a lot of great games released for other systems here this past week, too.
2903847	2909628	I mean, we had Mario Kart DS, we had the Ultramix, we had Call of Duty on other systems as well.
2909728	2911668	Call of Duty, Big Red One, yeah.
2911708	2913468	Just lots of games coming out this week.
2913488	2920730	This week was, or last week I should say, was one of the biggest launch weeks of the year.
2921370	2921770	It always is.
2921910	2923491	Wait, this is the Big Red One?
2924491	2925731	I need somebody who was in that.
2926394	2927475	PSP Advanced
2944886	2971592	but for the PSP so it allows you to put on video and mp3s and stuff very simple like and you can also play a lot of different formats that you couldn't play before like DivX files and whatnot and basically this program goes on your PSP runs on homebrew so it's you know made by an actual you know commercial company that's you know doing this and what's really cool is they were talking about selling it at first but they've decided to go ahead and release a
2972152	2972373	and so on.
2993396	2993977	Sounds cool.
2994137	2995558	So, you know, that's really neat.
2995878	3002324	The other thing which, of course, I'm excited about because, you know, Orange Laundry is all about the Bomani games is PSP Revolution.
3004039	3004539	Thanks for watching!
3028277	3036043	Alright, we're going to go over to our mailbag because it's been a little while since... Well, actually, I snuck into the mailbag when you weren't here last week, DarkSakura.
3036063	3036603	I hope you don't mind.
3036783	3038685	I snuck in there and stole some letters.
3040186	3040746	You're allowed.
3041066	3045670	Alright, but DarkSakura is going to read us some letters that are in our mailbox.
3046250	3052575	And if you want to send us an email, it's togo, T-O-G-O, at orangeloungeradio.com is the place to send your letters.
3052835	3053976	DarkSakura, what do we have this week?
3056015	3060218	My email I'd like to read is from our good buddy, Asian Buddy Paul.
3060798	3061058	Yes.
3062760	3067303	I couldn't get the article to pull up because it says you have to be a member of that site, and I was like, meh.
3067963	3069324	But I'll go ahead and read the email.
3069344	3080712	It said, hey LLR, I just encountered an article talking about current developments on educational video games and how professors are continuing to take them seriously as fundamental learning tools.
3081112	3082013	What do you guys think?
3082455	3087356	Will we see real great educational and fun video games popping up in schools in several years?
3087996	3094478	Not just like the classics in elementary school like Word Muncher, but like some similar ones to the ones stated in the article.
3094538	3096158	Of course, I couldn't get the article to pull up.
3096718	3100479	Maybe games that teach English to non-native speakers or foreign languages.
3100659	3102440	I'm just sort of skipping around now.
3102480	3104360	Japanese, French, Spanish, Chinese, to name a few.
3105698	3115282	As for real life scenario games involving ethics in real life situations like firing someone in tough decisions, I'm slightly skeptical, but I could see them put into intriguing action adventure games.
3116003	3117463	Sex Education the Video Game.
3118143	3119564	Anyway, just asking what you guys think.
3121357	3123437	I'm kind of surprised that this is news.
3123658	3129480	I mean, I kind of thought we were using computers and games for education type scenarios for a long time.
3129900	3134242	In my profession, actually, I'm not sure, you know, my day job, what I do is I actually teach people.
3134262	3135043	I'm a corporate trainer.
3135483	3138184	And I like to use computer-based things all the time.
3138204	3146548	And sometimes that might be a scenario where, you know, they actually choose, like, multiple choice questions that will alter the scenario of events.
3146568	3148509	Like, I don't want to give away too much of what it is I do, but...
3149069	3153392	There might be like a multiple choice thing and it changes the events and they watch what happens to their character.
3154292	3161637	In some aspects, and of course, you know, naming back to the classics there, we've all been using that game element in teaching for a long time.
3161677	3163258	Like Jeopardy, that's an old classic.
3163298	3165599	I use that for review all the time in my class.
3165719	3166960	So, I don't know.
3167820	3175585	Maybe it would help me to know, like, I'm assuming the article is talking a little more about console games and what the rest of us kind of think of as game games.
3176488	3179791	We need a return to Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego Where's Mario?
3179811	3181852	A lot of times the games are easy to use for younger people
3205259	3206000	Photoshop 3D
3230937	3234400	A class is only as good as the games that are taught in it.
3234480	3234980	No, forget it.
3235400	3235720	Alright.
3237622	3238883	You got one more quick email for us?
3239523	3240864	One more from Rini.
3241644	3241985	Alright.
3243946	3258196	Just to sort of paraphrase a bit, basically stating that one particular reason not everyone should run out to buy a 360 or PS3 or whatever on its launch date is possible problems with faults in the console.
3258216	3259297	Rini,
3260478	3265560	Just stating again, I am reminded of the PS2 launch when the thing erased memory cards and something else.
3266140	3273483	Of course, we did not encounter this, but then you'd have to go out to your nearest retailer and get an append disc or mentioning of an upgrade station.
3274003	3286128	Another reason is dealing with, I guess, the quality of the systems, holding off for something that might be better down the line, and also wanting to know where the ferrets are.
3287915	3290296	The ferrets were around here somewhere.
3291236	3294057	They might have died from starvation because you haven't been here, actually.
3294077	3295137	I'm not sure what's going on.
3295417	3297638	I haven't been there to keep them warm with my love.
3297698	3298218	Wait, hold on.
3300098	3300639	They're still here.
3300659	3302379	Where's my baby?
3302939	3304780	Of course I say that and my cat looks up.
3306280	3307700	Now she's not in here.
3307720	3308721	Now she left.
3308761	3309341	She's offended.
3310424	3314706	Well, yeah, but it depends on how much you use them, too, because you don't game all day long, nor do I.
3341621	3345762	That's true, and we hear that they were not good for DVD players, the first few.
3347323	3358427	With any of those systems, especially with the PS2, the more you use it as a dedicated DVD player, the more chance you have of ruining the system itself by that motor drive.
3359247	3366930	My PS2 got it at launch date, and I'm using it as my dedicated DVD player.
3367779	3368519	Perfectly fine.
3368559	3372100	Because you have a satanic curse in your house that keeps that thing running, is what it is.
3374381	3382803	I've actually known plenty of people who use theirs as their primary DVD player and have had nothing but problems.
3383263	3386704	I use my Xbox as my primary DVD player, but I don't play games on it.
3386864	3388404	But the Xbox was made quite a bit better.
3388786	3390427	Yeah, the Xbox was made quite a bit better.
3390447	3393328	And since I paid extra for that DVD kit, you better believe it's going to work.
3394869	3396269	Anyway, Loki, we're running out of time.
3396310	3398010	Loki, you got another story for us?
3398090	3398831	Yeah, real quick.
3399151	3403173	Of course, we got to still talk about the 360 launch being that it is on Tuesday.
3403193	3404033	All right.
3404493	3410276	They had some craziness on Friday when Circuit City started taking pre-orders for what 360s they were going to have.
3410376	3411997	I remember what we mentioned last week.
3412117	3413798	Oh, they're going to sell them in the stores on Friday.
3413838	3416059	Sure enough, the day after our podcast rolled out.
3416160	3417160	Oh no, that was all a big lie.
3417500	3420302	So Circus City's... So they were being sold on their website.
3420322	3423964	They actually did have the units out of the bundle, so that was kind of interesting.
3424124	3428827	Or you could pre-order the bundle and delete the additional stuff on there, which is also interesting.
3429247	3431669	Well, that was if you're lucky enough to be able to actually get through.
3431829	3437933	The site was hammered so much it went down as well as their entire technical support line was just jammed up.
3438593	3439873	So that was interesting.
3440133	3448755	There's actually people now camping for their 360 right now, but you can always assure that the celebrities are going to have one.
3448776	3453297	They had an LA launch party for the 360, and Paris Hilton has a bag with the 360.
3453337	3455057	That is so fucked up.
3455097	3456657	What do you think Paris Hilton is going to play on her 360?
3456697	3458898	She doesn't know what a 360 is, okay?
3458938	3460278	That's basically that.
3460438	3463039	And then finally, my favorite store in the world.
3463579	3466540	That makes me mad that you won't get a 360, but Paris Hilton will.
3466780	3467280	Come on.
3469679	3470500	You know she's a big gamer.
3472001	3473301	Well, not video games.
3473502	3485089	My personal favorite is the ad for Best Buy showing the 360 and stating that it's the absolute latest in gaming that burns CDs and DVDs too.
3485189	3488791	Thank you, Best Buy, for lying and not even knowing what the hell you're talking about.
3489672	3491653	I will not be going to Best Buy to buy anything for my 360.
3492254	3492994	Thank you very much.
3493414	3494515	It's just one mistake.
3494535	3495756	It's a printing mistake.
3495836	3496656	Don't blame the whole business.
3496676	3497377	Well, that's not why I'm...
3500590	3502331	You guys are vicious!
3502932	3504253	We sue you!
3504433	3505834	Gotta be vicious to keep up.
3506275	3509017	Oh man, I hate to be in line with you people on Tuesday.
3510499	3511820	Guess who's not going to be in line?
3512781	3513762	Look, don't rub it in.
3514162	3514843	Stop rubbing it in.
3515263	3516504	We'll come to your house and take it.
3518926	3519787	Real quick mentions.
3520088	3523451	If you pre-order Dirge of Service right now, you can actually get a
3524306	3529650	DarkSakura has our last story tonight regarding gaming in another country We've got one actually published by Eurogamer
3552918	3558841	A group of German politicians proposed a ban on all video games that show lethal violence.
3562283	3563323	That's pretty much simply it?
3565184	3575570	They're actually... It's basically already looking at... I'm trying to find the group that was calling for this.
3576050	3581373	The Christian Social Union saying that killing games have no place in Germany's bedrooms.
3582709	3586310	There already, though, are having some folks against that.
3587011	3589272	If only you people knew what went on in my bedroom.
3589632	3591052	The gaming happens in the living room.
3592993	3594073	I shouldn't have said that on the radio.
3595134	3608899	Well, the head of Germany's Interactive Software Association, Olaf Wolters, basically was quoted in Der Spiegel saying, as far as we're concerned, there are no such things as killer games, but adult games.
3609434	3609674	Very good.
3609694	3612475	And they're willing to work with the governments to resolve the issue.
3614015	3631800	It's stated also that Germany has some of the strictest censorship laws in the world, but they needed revision, especially after in 2002 a 19-year-old shot and killed 16 people in Erfurt before turning the gun on himself as he was also an avid player of Counter-Strike.
3633881	3636521	They're saying the new legislation, if approved, will go into effect March 2008.
3636561	3636882	It's just...
3639476	3644139	Just a bunch of crazy people trying to ban things because they can't watch their kids.
3644219	3645300	It's just stupid.
3646100	3646660	It won't happen.
3647181	3648221	You know what's going to happen, though?
3648821	3654124	The only way we're going to be able to solve violent games in Germany is to make more David Hasselhoff games.
3654244	3656386	I knew you were going to make a David Hasselhoff joke.
3656446	3661168	I was trying to think of a good Shiza porn joke, but I want to keep this a family show tonight.
3663069	3663890	Jamie, your thoughts?
3666511	3667112	I don't know.
3667392	3667692	You know,
3669611	3672533	It's really hard because you know how I feel about this.
3672553	3674054	Parents should be doing their jobs, right?
3674634	3679797	The manufacturer should also be taking responsibility to label their games correctly, yes?
3681518	3685841	But I don't think that the government has any business poking their nose into it.
3686061	3691464	It should be left up to the consumer and up to the manufacturer to keep the consumer informed.
3691716	3694957	Especially with a statement as subjective as any violent game.
3694997	3696118	Well, that could be anything.
3696178	3698119	I mean, what's violent?
3698439	3701920	Is Tom and Jerry with a big cartoon hammer, is that violent?
3702281	3704882	You whack-a-mole the game, that's pretty violent.
3704942	3705502	I know.
3705702	3709984	So, I hate, I hate, hate, hate, and it's what I hated about the California law.
3710024	3713705	I hate these subjective things that leave too much open to interpretation.
3715825	3719466	All right, well, that is going to do it for tonight's program.
3720026	3722467	So let's go around and get everybody's final thoughts.
3722727	3725148	DarkSakura, your final thought, and then we're going to say goodbye to you.
3726328	3729209	Reject false icons and keep gaming.
3729950	3736812	All right, we're going to go ahead and click the Hang Up button now, DarkSakura, but thanks so much for sitting with us on Skype tonight, and we'll see you next time, okay?
3737312	3737672	Bye.
3737892	3738372	Bye-bye.
3739093	3740053	Loki, your final thought.
3742298	3746485	My final thought is I'm going to beat this stupid Mario Kart DS.
3746806	3748148	I'm going to get robbed, finally.
3749089	3749410	All right.
3750091	3753998	And my final thought is Tuesday, when you're all fighting those lines...
3754522	3761924	I'm going to be sitting back playing some World of Warcraft and Mario Kart DS and I'll just take my sweet ass time and buying that Xbox 360.
3761964	3762485	Thank you very much.
3763205	3768526	Alright, we promised one more Midi Head song tonight before we close out so we're going to leave you guys with this tonight.
3768887	3770647	This is also from DDR Ultramix 3.
