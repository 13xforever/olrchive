You're tuned in to the Orange Lounge Radio To Go Edition.

00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Your podcast calls for all the latest video game news and gamer chat.

Now, here are your hosts, DarkSakura, Sky, and Loki.

00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Hello, everybody. Once again, you're tuned in to Orange Lounge Radio To Go.

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
It's the podcast dedicated to video games that don't suck,

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:33,000
But sometimes we have to talk about a few games that do suck, only to tell you to stay far, far away from them.

8
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:40,000
My name is Rob Roberts, you might know me as Sky. Joining me, as always, actually back from a little vacation, is Dark Sakura.

9
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Not really a vacation thing, it's how I was working my ass off during all that time.

10
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Well, okay, but a vacation from the show. Did you miss us?

11
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
My aim's improving.

12
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:56,000
That's what I thought you'd say. Now, ironically enough, even though you're out past two weeks, you're not going to be here next week.

13
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,320

00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:53,960

we got a lot of interesting news a brand new movie is being made

30
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:14,760
out of a video game we're definitely going to talk about that we're going to talk about some

31
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:16,660
upcoming Nintendo DS releases

32
00:02:16,660 --> 00:02:20,140
not just Mario Kart DS and all that stuff but looking into first quarter next year

33
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:23,660
and on tonight's program we have an interview

34
00:02:23,660 --> 00:02:27,060
which should be very interesting we actually have a follow-up to a story we

35
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:28,580
talked about a couple weeks ago

36
00:02:28,580 --> 00:02:31,860
gonna be a good good show so we're gonna start off tonight though

37
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:34,860
as we always like to start off Orange Lounge Radio To Go by talking about

38
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:38,660
our gaming week and what we've been up to so DarkSakura why don't you start us off

39
00:02:38,660 --> 00:02:42,060
um seeing as how school and

40
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:45,940
everything has been kicking my butt I did however get Guitar Hero

41
00:02:45,940 --> 00:02:47,940
on Friday

42
00:02:47,980 --> 00:02:51,220
Been playing the crap out of it. I love that game

43
00:02:51,220 --> 00:02:56,540
I was actually it's more or less me playing more than I feel and on repeat because I love that song

44
00:02:56,900 --> 00:03:02,140
Yeah, it wasn't until I played it on your TV that I ever started missing more than one note in a row. Oh gee

45
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:07,620
Sorry, well, it's kind of standing up and looking down and have this killer of a headache, but

46
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:10,580
I'm sorry. It's all perspective

47
00:03:10,580 --> 00:03:15,300
I think I would have done better had I been sitting down but you have to sort of stand and rock out with that guitar

48
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:22,620
you know and then um uh really it's been you know it's hard for me to get to my

49
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:27,920
TV because Dan's been going on a Star Wars kick lately as playing the battle

50
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:32,560
front 2 game no he's freaking watching episode 3 and then went back and watch

51
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:39,540
the others oh that kind of powers kick I hear you know this is bad acting coming

52
00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:46,540
out of hating Christians, and I'm like, oh! No! So, George Lucas owes me $30.

53
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:50,140
Alright. Loki, how was your gaming week?

54
00:03:50,140 --> 00:03:57,140
My week was good. I actually was playing more PSP stuff than anything, which is pretty interesting.

55
00:03:57,180 --> 00:04:03,080
Complete opposite of before. What I've been playing lately has been Grand Theft Auto,

56
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:07,660
and what it is is we've got four copies in the office at work, and the four of us go

57
00:04:07,660 --> 00:04:13,680
down every break, twice a day, and do four player deathmatch. And lately it's been pretty

58
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:17,880
good. My boss has been getting a lot better, but I kicked the crap out of all of them the

59
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:24,880
other day with my Janet Reno character who's a kickass sharpshooter with a rocket launcher.

60
00:04:25,660 --> 00:04:30,260
So I'm pretty deadly with that thing. And it's funny seeing Janet Reno run around with

61
00:04:30,260 --> 00:04:37,260
a chainsaw and murder people, but you know, don't underestimate old women. Awesome. Now

62
00:04:37,260 --> 00:04:40,380
has the multiplayer kind of increased your perception of the game? Because I remember

63
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:43,820
last week you didn't really give it that great a review. You said it was kind of okay.

64
00:04:43,820 --> 00:04:48,300
It was okay. The multiplayer is really fun. The only thing though is I'm not really interested

65
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:52,540
in the other multiplayer modes like the capture the flag and stuff. I think with the amount of

66
00:04:52,540 --> 00:04:59,900
players that supports, which is only six, it's not very enticing. It's just something that I think

67
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:05,580
would be better with more players. But four player deathmatch is just really fun. The other game I

68
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:09,580
was actually trying out today was Star Wars Battlefront 2 for the PSP. Now I haven't played

69
00:05:09,580 --> 00:05:13,980
the console version of the Star Wars Battlefront 2 yet, so I can't really compare the two,

70
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:19,220
but it did seem pretty plain to me. The levels remind me of stuff that might have been on

71
00:05:19,220 --> 00:05:26,100
say the Playstation, like the original Playstation stuff. But other than that it was pretty fun.

72
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:30,780
I did have trouble seeing some of the characters because they kind of blended into the background

73
00:05:30,780 --> 00:05:34,780
so that kind of sucked, but the space battles and stuff were pretty fun and I was just kind

74
00:05:34,780 --> 00:05:40,900
of reminded me of some of the older games for the Playstation 1 though, I can't remember

75
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:46,140
the title off the top of my head, but really fun game and of course been playing War Warriors.

76
00:05:46,140 --> 00:05:51,140
That game's really cool, it just keeps getting better every level I play, so really awesome

77
00:05:51,140 --> 00:05:56,860
game and I didn't get a chance to play Shadow Colossus like I hoped, but hopefully gonna

78
00:05:56,860 --> 00:06:00,580
pick up Guitar Hero this week, and yeah.

79
00:06:00,580 --> 00:06:02,040
All right

80
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:07,360
Now I was promising last week on the podcast that I would actually be giving a review of the Taito

81
00:06:08,020 --> 00:06:10,020
Collection that was recently released for Xbox

82
00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:15,760
However, I'm tabling that yet another week because I bought a game this week that kind of took up most of my game time

83
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:20,640
And that was Guitar Hero. I know all three of us have mentioned now, but I really did I picked up Guitar Hero

84
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:23,640
It's awesome. It's a great music game

85
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:29,020
It's like fuse guitar freaks the Konami Guitar Freaks game if you've ever played it fuse that with

86
00:06:29,020 --> 00:06:34,420
amplitude frequency and it's really what you've got here except you know it's not

87
00:06:34,420 --> 00:06:39,300
really a guitar freaks clone it really does improve I think on that in fact it

88
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:43,180
doesn't really seem inspired by guitar freaks as much as it does it seem

89
00:06:43,180 --> 00:06:46,980
inspired by frequency and amplitude and to some extent karaoke revolution as

90
00:06:46,980 --> 00:06:50,220
well because harmonics developed that game as well so I think those you guys

91
00:06:50,220 --> 00:06:53,660
that are kind of missing frequency and amplitude in those games you're gonna

92
00:06:53,660 --> 00:06:59,780
really enjoy Guitar Hero. It's pretty much the same idea with the ISO notes

93
00:06:59,780 --> 00:07:05,420
kind of falling down and great song list, freeze pops back, a lot of unsigned bands,

94
00:07:05,420 --> 00:07:10,420
great cover songs in this game. They're not the actual songs

95
00:07:10,420 --> 00:07:14,480
but they sound so much like them it's very hard to tell the difference.

96
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:18,260
Harmonix did an outstanding job on this game. Red Octane put together a very good

97
00:07:18,260 --> 00:07:21,500
controller for the game. The controller is solid. It's even got a whammy bar

98
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:25,900
people. It's got a whammy bar. What more do I need to say? It's a great game, I hope

99
00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:30,140
there's a sequel. Even if you're not that into music games, I think Guitar Hero is

100
00:07:30,140 --> 00:07:34,420
something very accessible. What I like about Guitar Hero, what I really like is

101
00:07:34,420 --> 00:07:38,700
the art direction. The artwork is outstanding, the way the game is put

102
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:41,980
together is great, but where I think Guitar Hero really shines is it's not put

103
00:07:41,980 --> 00:07:46,420
together like most of Konami's Bamani games, where you walk up, play your game,

104
00:07:46,420 --> 00:07:50,300
leave. What I like about Guitar Hero is it's got that little story mode that

105
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:54,620
kind of you know it's got it makes all these little extras so much fun like

106
00:07:54,620 --> 00:07:59,120
getting to see your review of how you did in the paper and having the you know

107
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:02,220
blow up and the guitar you know spinning around when you're doing a really good

108
00:08:02,220 --> 00:08:07,380
job and just setting it on setting it on fire when you're done setting it on fire

109
00:08:07,380 --> 00:08:13,500
when you're done and all that stuff that it's just amazing the way they have it

110
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:16,580
all put together is great so I highly recommend Guitar Hero if you're a music

111
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:19,640
game fan if you're not a music game fan I do still recommend you check it out at

112
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:23,060
it's one of the more accessible games and I'm definitely looking forward to

113
00:08:23,060 --> 00:08:26,420
Guitar Hero 2, which I think would be a given at this point because I did not

114
00:08:26,420 --> 00:08:31,220
just spend $70 on game and controller for there to only be this one game, okay?

115
00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:36,060
All right, now since it's been a little while since Dark Sakura has been able to

116
00:08:36,060 --> 00:08:39,560
be on the program, we have to start off tonight because she's got a little

117
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:44,300
catch-up to do and you know that you missed it. It's the one and only

118
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:48,220
advice column because you guys, if we stayed home and played video games all

119
00:08:48,220 --> 00:08:52,220
all day long. We'd have no time to go out and set guitars on fire.

120
00:08:52,220 --> 00:08:56,220
Rock. So, um, DarkSakura, why don't you tell us

121
00:08:56,220 --> 00:09:00,220
what your advice column is all about tonight?

122
00:09:00,220 --> 00:09:04,220
Today's piece of advice

123
00:09:04,220 --> 00:09:08,220
is how to escape from the trunk of a car.

124
00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:12,220
If you are, first of all, if you're dumb enough to get stuck in the trunk of a car

125
00:09:12,220 --> 00:09:16,220
you shouldn't have my mercy, but let's go ahead and be nice anyway.

126
00:09:16,220 --> 00:09:22,220
Number one, if you are in a trunk that is up against the back seat of a car, try to get the seats down.

127
00:09:22,220 --> 00:09:27,220
Number two, if the trunk has a cable release, pull on it to release the latch.

128
00:09:27,220 --> 00:09:32,220
Should I think any car built after, what was it, 86 was it?

129
00:09:32,220 --> 00:09:33,220
No idea.

130
00:09:33,220 --> 00:09:38,220
It's required by law to have, basically if you buy any new car, it's going to have a latch in it.

131
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:40,220
It's required by law.

132
00:09:40,220 --> 00:09:49,220
Number 3. Look for tools to pry the latch open. Many cars have emergency kits under the spare tire. Use a screwdriver or crowbar to open the latch.

133
00:09:49,220 --> 00:09:52,220
Or, as in Beeps and Bowhead Do America, a jack.

134
00:09:52,220 --> 00:09:54,220
That was funny.

135
00:09:54,220 --> 00:10:03,220
4. Dismantle the car's brake lights by yanking wires and kicking the lights out. Then wave and yell and signal to passersby or other cars.

136
00:10:03,220 --> 00:10:05,220
But my final piece of advice?

137
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:06,220
Yes.

138
00:10:06,220 --> 00:10:12,740
Just don't get stuck in the trunk, God.

139
00:10:12,740 --> 00:10:15,300
Don't make friends who are in the mafia.

140
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:19,180
Yeah, don't make friends who are in the mafia.

141
00:10:19,180 --> 00:10:21,740
Don't try to sneak people into drive-throughs and all that stuff.

142
00:10:21,740 --> 00:10:22,740
Oh God.

143
00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:23,740
Or not drive-throughs, drive-ins.

144
00:10:23,740 --> 00:10:24,740
I remember though.

145
00:10:24,740 --> 00:10:25,740
Drive-throughs are a little different.

146
00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:26,740
What was it?

147
00:10:26,740 --> 00:10:27,740
Smiggle 2?

148
00:10:27,740 --> 00:10:28,740
Yes, Sunnyvale Golf Land DR.

149
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:34,600
Right, where we do lanky style in the backseat of Iguan, in the trunk of Iguanagirl's car.

150
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:38,400
So we could all make it over to Lion's, I remember that now, the restaurant.

151
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:39,400
Hilarious.

152
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:44,560
I've never seen paleness of that nature outside of the goth scene.

153
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:48,520
You've never seen paleness of that nature, hmm?

154
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:50,000
Outside of the goth scene.

155
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Okay.

156
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:56,720
All right, anyway, let's move on and get into some stories tonight, what's going on in the

157
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:58,520
gaming world.

158
00:10:58,520 --> 00:11:00,280
Starting off tonight, I thought we would bring this up.

159
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:03,160
It's very interesting because on last week's show we were talking about how the video games

160
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:05,840
live tour got canceled?

161
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:13,740
Not even a week later, here it is, an announcement going out that Play, a video game symphony

162
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:18,240
which is being put together by JMP Productions, who is the team behind Dear Friends Music

163
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:22,160
from Final Fantasy, they are going to go on a worldwide tour.

164
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:26,520
It's going to kick off in North America sometime in the year 2006 and it's going to have music

165
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:33,360
from Battlefield 1942, World of Warcraft, Final Fantasy, The Elder Scrolls 3, and much

166
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:35,360
much more.

167
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:41,440
The maestro will be Arnie Roth, who I believe was the man at More Friends, I might be getting

168
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:45,760
that wrong, I don't know, but it should be very interesting, the folks that put together

169
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:47,720
Dear Friends are going to be doing this too.

170
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:50,960
So what do you think, do you think this will be successful, where Video Games Live was

171
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:53,440
not so successful, where it got cancelled, or what?

172
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:56,720
they have the experience of at least putting on a show like this so we know that they're

173
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:59,240
capable of it and it shouldn't be that much.

174
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:04,480
To Video Games Live credit, they did do the Hollywood Bowl show, which was successful.

175
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:09,000
But they have pulled off a successful tour at least around the United States and Japan

176
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
and stuff.

177
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:15,520
So, I think, Shin being different than a More Friends concert with different music, that's

178
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:16,520
about it.

179
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:21,040
I mean, it's not really anything different that they have to pull off, so yeah, sure,

180
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:22,040
why not.

181
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:28,040
Dark Sakura, is this a concert that sounds like something you'd want to go to? Maybe get a little culture with your game?

182
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:39,040
Well, I listen to real classical music, but I don't know that it'd be worth the ticket unless they actually put stuff that people actually play.

183
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:42,040
Well, lots of people play World of Warcraft and Final Fantasy.

184
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:45,040
Well, that's not World of Warcraft and Final Fantasy, I'm talking about...

185
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:50,040
It's not anything I have any interest in, maybe if it was like console games.

186
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:53,720
well okay that's I guess that's true cuz most of those games we named off there

187
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:56,400
were PC games but you got to assume that there's gonna be some console in there

188
00:12:56,400 --> 00:13:02,280
too I mean Final Fantasy console but we've seen that before maybe maybe

189
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:09,240
everything you've named off are MMOs okay okay well not Battlefield 1942 oh yeah

190
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:13,160
Battlefield 1942 that's true but that's still very it's kind of more known as a

191
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:18,680
PC title I think all the scrolls is an MMO it's not an MMO but it's yeah yeah

192
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:22,840
They're all PC games or at least we we need a console series like that

193
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:25,640
So as long as it's an expansive eclectic

194
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:32,920
But not like where they're including pong and Donkey Kong or whatever that other whatever that are you doing the other tour is promising

195
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:38,920
Pong had no music in it. Well, I think that'd be no remix. Oh

196
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:42,120
With beeping it. Oh, I'm sorry

197
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:47,080
Alright. Yes. No. Alright, but how about how about some music from katamari?

198
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:51,080
Would that sell the ticket if they put Katamari Damacy music in there?

199
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:52,080
Maybe.

200
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:54,080
That'd be weird, but okay.

201
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:56,080
It'd be awesome.

202
00:13:56,080 --> 00:14:01,080
Alright, we're going to go into another story here, and this has to do, you know we love

203
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:05,080
to talk about video games being made into movies, just because this happened so much

204
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:07,080
this year, honestly, we've had a lot of gaming news.

205
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:12,080
Well, the next one out the gate looks like it's going to be Castlevania.

206
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:16,080
That's right, Crystal Sky Pictures has picked up the rights to adapt Castlevania

207
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:20,080
and attached to direct Paul W.S. Anderson.

208
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:24,080
Paul W.S. Anderson is the man behind Resident Evil and Mortal Kombat,

209
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:26,080
which were pretty decent video game adaptations.

210
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:29,080
Granted, better than Alone in the Dark, certainly.

211
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:32,080
But let's not forget he also did Alien vs. Predator.

212
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:35,080
So, what can you do?

213
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:38,080
Anyway, so we don't know much about the story just yet.

214
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:41,080
More information to come on this, but what do you guys think?

215
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:45,080
I remember we do this segment on the live show called Listless

216
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:49,960
where we make our top three list of things that should happen within the

217
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:54,520
video game community I know we did one time we did video game we would most

218
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:57,560
like to see a movie made out of and I seem to remember Castlevania being in

219
00:14:57,560 --> 00:15:03,760
the top three so is this a good idea or a bad idea I did have to do it right I

220
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:09,760
would be very skeptical what what what do you think they could do to help this

221
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:12,360
this along.

222
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:17,360
Well not screw up the content hopefully keep true to the game and make sure that the publishers

223
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:24,120
of the game had creative control over it.

224
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:30,700
That would be my guess is make sure that they are definitely keeping tabs on what's going

225
00:15:30,700 --> 00:15:36,320
on with the game so it stays true to the storyline and content and everything like that.

226
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:41,760
Okay, what we're going to do now is I promised a little earlier in the show is that we were

227
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:45,120
going to talk a little bit about a follow-up to something we talked about a couple weeks

228
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:46,120
ago.

229
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:47,120
I don't know if you guys heard about this.

230
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:50,400
Did you guys hear about the King's Quest IX fan project that was going on?

231
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:54,800
Now you know the King's Quest series was developed by Sierra years and years ago, right?

232
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:56,400
Of course you remember the old King's Quest games.

233
00:15:56,400 --> 00:16:00,880
I know my favorite is the King's Quest IV, the one that kind of seemed very inspired

234
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:03,280
by a lot of different fairy tales.

235
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:06,940
Well the series actually ended with King's Quest VIII and what happened is that Vivendi

236
00:16:06,940 --> 00:16:13,160
actually bought Sierra and decided to discontinue making King's Quest games because they felt

237
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:17,460
there wasn't enough demand for these adventure series anymore.

238
00:16:17,460 --> 00:16:19,500
So they stopped making the games.

239
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:22,300
Well the fan community, and there's quite a community out there for the King's Quest

240
00:16:22,300 --> 00:16:25,180
games, wasn't happy with that answer.

241
00:16:25,180 --> 00:16:30,400
So there's some folks that got together and decided they were going to make a fan game.

242
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:34,680
But as we reported on the show a couple of weeks ago, Vivendi actually issued a cease

243
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:39,920
and desist against the company that was coming together to make this King's Quest IX game.

244
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:44,360
So we have on the show tonight an interview with some of the people that are involved

245
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:50,320
with the King's Quest IX project, one of them being somebody who is trying to save the King's

246
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:55,120
Quest IX game and somebody close with the King's Quest IX production team.

247
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:59,400
So I've got here with me Matt from the Save King's Quest IX project.

248
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:01,840
Thank you very much for being on the show here today, Matt.

249
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:02,840
Thank you for having me.

250
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:03,840
No problem.

251
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:08,360
So how did you discover the King's Quest IX project?

252
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:11,960
You know, it's been so many years now, I don't really remember.

253
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:14,560
How long has the King's Quest IX project been going on?

254
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:17,600
I believe it's been going on for about four years.

255
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:19,240
For about four years, wow.

256
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:22,080
So it's been a long-time project in the making.

257
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:23,080
Absolutely.

258
00:17:23,080 --> 00:17:27,600
So what was your reaction to the news that Vivendi had issued the cease and desist against

259
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:28,600
the project?

260
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:35,200
I think like a lot of fans, disappointment, you know, sadness and disappointment.

261
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:40,560
So why then did you end up starting the SaveKQIX.org website?

262
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:43,480
Well because I was disappointed and because I knew there were a lot of fans that were

263
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:44,480
disappointed.

264
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:49,760
I just wanted to try to do something to help, wanted to do something to try to help convince

265
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:54,800
the Vendi to take a look at this and see if there was a way that the game could be released.

266
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:59,180
Now I noticed when I was looking at the website that you guys are kind of taking a unique

267
00:17:59,180 --> 00:18:04,440
approach to trying to kind of petition Vivendi, so to speak, to take a second look at what

268
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:09,520
theyíre doing here and most people would use like a petition online type website for

269
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:13,620
these sorts of drives, but you guys are advising a letter writing campaign.

270
00:18:13,620 --> 00:18:16,400
Why did you decide to do the letter writing as opposed to petition online?

271
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:18,520
Well, weíre actually doing a number of things.

272
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:24,240
One, weíre doing the email writing and then weíre also doing the letter writing.

273
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:28,880
The email thing, the reason we're going with email rather than a petition was because we

274
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:34,520
wanted to make sure that when people emailed, it was coming from a legitimate email address.

275
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:38,760
On an online petition, you can just type in whatever email address you want, so it isn't

276
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:41,400
necessarily legitimate.

277
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:45,720
And then the letter writing campaign, we want as many people as possible to take the time

278
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:51,200
to sit down and write a letter, drop it in the mail, because really those letters mean

279
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:56,200
the most to corporations like Vivendi.

280
00:18:56,200 --> 00:19:00,520
What would be the ideal outcome of this Save King's Quest 9 drive?

281
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:06,440
What do you envision as a realistic possibility for the masses to be able to play the game?

282
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:09,280
Our goal is for the game to be released.

283
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:16,080
Whether it's released as freeware or whether it's released as a legitimate commercial release

284
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:18,540
by Vivendi, we don't really care.

285
00:19:18,540 --> 00:19:22,660
We just want the game to be out there for gamers to play it.

286
00:19:22,660 --> 00:19:26,980
How big would you say is the community behind this, because I noticed that the King's Quest

287
00:19:26,980 --> 00:19:32,040
community out there is still very large and very active, and part of the reason Vivendi

288
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:35,080
has sort of said they're not going to continue the series in the past is because they don't

289
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:38,840
think they have the support, but it seems to me that there's a very large following

290
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:39,840
out there.

291
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:42,100
How big would you say is the King's Quest following out there?

292
00:19:42,100 --> 00:19:55,100
It's hard to give a specific number, but I do believe that there is enough support out there that a commercial release of a King's Quest IX would do well.

293
00:19:55,100 --> 00:19:58,100
I mean, adventure games in general are still being released.

294
00:19:58,100 --> 00:20:07,100
You know, Fahrenheit just came out, The Longest Journey is releasing a sequel, Siberia had two games that sold very well.

295
00:20:07,100 --> 00:20:13,100
So I think there still is a pretty good adventure game community out there, but it's hard to

296
00:20:13,100 --> 00:20:14,940
put an exact number on it.

297
00:20:14,940 --> 00:20:20,140
How would you feel if Vivendi took all this information to see that there was a drive

298
00:20:20,140 --> 00:20:26,140
to have the King's Quest series reignited, and then they decided to put out their own

299
00:20:26,140 --> 00:20:28,940
game, as opposed to what these fans have been working on?

300
00:20:28,940 --> 00:20:32,380
Is that something you would support, or would that be...

301
00:20:32,380 --> 00:20:39,340
So, we really would like to see this particular King's Quest game be released.

302
00:20:39,340 --> 00:20:43,900
But yeah, we would certainly support Vivendi if they decided they wanted to do their own

303
00:20:43,900 --> 00:20:45,380
King's Quest game.

304
00:20:45,380 --> 00:20:47,360
So you would prefer to see this game released?

305
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:50,000
I would like to see this game released.

306
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:54,740
I'd love to see them allow this game to come out as a fan game, and then they can release

307
00:20:54,740 --> 00:20:57,820
their own official version of King's Quest IX.

308
00:20:57,820 --> 00:21:04,340
All right, so I know we have a lot of PC gaming fans that listen to this program, so how can

309
00:21:04,340 --> 00:21:05,340
they help?

310
00:21:05,340 --> 00:21:09,900
I know we've talked about writing letters, visiting the website, savekqix.org.

311
00:21:09,900 --> 00:21:13,520
How can our listeners best help you guys out if they remember the King's Quest games and

312
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:16,120
would love to see a new entry in the series?

313
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:23,500
The best thing they can do to help is go visit the website, www.savekqix.org.

314
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:27,060
On the website, we talk about all the different things that they can do to help.

315
00:21:27,060 --> 00:21:31,540
The big thing we're focusing on is sending an email to Vivendi, and we make that very

316
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:34,120
easy to do on our website.

317
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:36,140
You can also blog about us.

318
00:21:36,140 --> 00:21:41,220
You can write a letter to Vivendi like we already talked about, send emails out to all

319
00:21:41,220 --> 00:21:44,020
your friends about us, just help us spread the word.

320
00:21:44,020 --> 00:21:46,780
That's the other really important thing that we need people to do.

321
00:21:46,780 --> 00:21:50,260
All right, so we hope our listeners can help you guys get the word out there.

322
00:21:50,260 --> 00:21:52,360
All right, thanks, Matt, so much for being on the show today.

323
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:53,360
We appreciate it.

324
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:54,360
Thank you.

325
00:21:54,360 --> 00:22:03,760
We also decided to contact Cesar, and Cesar is involved with the King's Quest IX project

326
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:04,760
itself.

327
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:06,720
Thank you so much for being on the show today, Cesar.

328
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:11,160
Thank you very much for having me in your show.

329
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:14,320
We know that's happening on King's Quest IX right now.

330
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:19,760
I'm pretty busy right now, but I can't stop the opportunity to be on the show.

331
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:23,080
We appreciate you taking the time out to help us out with the show.

332
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:26,720
What is your role with the King's Quest IX project, for those who may not know?

333
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:30,080
I'm basically the project director and I'm also the main designer.

334
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:37,120
I basically take the responsibility of having everything going smoothly and handing the

335
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:39,040
assignment to all the people.

336
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:44,880
I also wrote a script that came out to be more than 50 hundred pages.

337
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:47,080
It's a really long script.

338
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:49,320
Wow, that's a huge script.

339
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:52,600
Could you tell us a little bit about what the story is about?

340
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:57,000
Does it continue the King's Quest series or is it a new direction or could you tell

341
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,320
us a little bit about the story?

342
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:00,660
It's a little bit of both.

343
00:23:00,660 --> 00:23:07,220
We want to give some kind of closure to the King's Quest series, but it also takes a

344
00:23:07,220 --> 00:23:11,800
new direction in the sense that it's a much more darker story.

345
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:16,460
We want to create something more for this time.

346
00:23:16,460 --> 00:23:21,880
When you see stories like Harry Potter and Lord of the Rings and all that kind of stories

347
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:24,120
that take a much more darker plot.

348
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:27,280
We wanted to take the beginning to that direction,

349
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:30,400
but you can actually say that it's between King's Quest

350
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:32,520
and Lord of the Rings.

351
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:34,840
Of the story, it basically starts

352
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:37,880
when in the middle of the celebration

353
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:41,320
in the Green Isles, a lot of stuff happens,

354
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:45,000
and a direct disturbance falls into the land.

355
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:51,160
And King Graham sets out to find a way to reverse the spell.

356
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:56,800
As he does that, he finds out that thereís a lot more involved.

357
00:23:56,800 --> 00:24:03,880
Itís about a property that has been taking place for a thousand years and there are societies

358
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:04,880
involved in this.

359
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:09,360
Itís a really complicated and long story.

360
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:12,720
With 1,500 pages, I canít imagine.

361
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:18,360
With all that work, having gone into it with the script and your entire team of programmers

362
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:21,880
and art and just everything that goes into this.

363
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:27,820
Is it tough having spent all these hours and then having Vivendi come in and issue this

364
00:24:27,820 --> 00:24:28,820
cease and desist?

365
00:24:28,820 --> 00:24:31,480
I mean what was your guys' reaction to this news?

366
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:38,400
Well, all this time we knew that it could happen and we were kind of ready for that

367
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:45,660
to happen and as Phoenix Online Studios we weren't going to stop working as a company

368
00:24:45,660 --> 00:24:53,540
Even if we had to change all the stuff that we had into something new, what we wanted

369
00:24:53,540 --> 00:24:59,100
to do was try to get Kings vs. Knights to happen commercially.

370
00:24:59,100 --> 00:25:04,180
In the case that that didn't happen, we had a plan B where we basically could create

371
00:25:04,180 --> 00:25:08,500
our own game with everything that we had until that point.

372
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:13,500
Of course, we would have to change a lot of the stuff that we had, but it's doable.

373
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:17,540
I was kind of curious about that when we first talked about this story when it kind of hit

374
00:25:17,540 --> 00:25:19,620
the news a couple of weeks ago.

375
00:25:19,620 --> 00:25:24,500
Some of us had joked that they could take King's Quest and make it Queen's Journey

376
00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:27,460
or something by changing all the art and stuff.

377
00:25:27,460 --> 00:25:29,220
Is that a realistic plan B?

378
00:25:29,220 --> 00:25:36,860
Well, I wouldn't say that because Queen's Journey is definitely a good joke.

379
00:25:36,860 --> 00:25:37,860
Well, I know.

380
00:25:37,860 --> 00:25:43,060
It's a silly name, but the same idea behind just changing the names and things that may

381
00:25:43,060 --> 00:25:46,700
relate to the King's Quest story and just kind of changing it so that this game could

382
00:25:46,700 --> 00:25:48,340
come out as its own series?

383
00:25:48,340 --> 00:25:49,340
Right.

384
00:25:49,340 --> 00:25:53,820
But we will basically have to strip it off from a lot of stuff that it has, because we

385
00:25:53,820 --> 00:25:57,080
used a lot of the backstory of King's Quest.

386
00:25:57,080 --> 00:26:03,580
Like I say, we wanted to bring a closure to the series, so if we were to make it a regional

387
00:26:03,580 --> 00:26:06,380
game, we would have to work a lot on it.

388
00:26:06,380 --> 00:26:07,380
But it's doable.

389
00:26:07,380 --> 00:26:09,420
I mean, it's not impossible.

390
00:26:09,420 --> 00:26:15,900
Now, I'm sure you're aware of this savekqix.org website where they're trying to get people

391
00:26:15,900 --> 00:26:20,660
to send letters to Vivendi to save this project.

392
00:26:20,660 --> 00:26:25,460
Are you willing to talk to Vivendi one-on-one, sit down at the table and try to work this

393
00:26:25,460 --> 00:26:26,460
out?

394
00:26:26,460 --> 00:26:32,240
We're basically already talking to Vivendi, but that's about all I can say at the moment

395
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:38,380
because we are under a constitutional agreement, so there's not much I can say about that.

396
00:26:38,380 --> 00:26:43,540
the Safe King Quest 9 side and all the clients that are trying to help out, I really appreciate

397
00:26:43,540 --> 00:26:44,540
their support.

398
00:26:44,540 --> 00:26:50,580
I want to take the time to thank them because everything that they've been doing has been

399
00:26:50,580 --> 00:26:52,900
working out.

400
00:26:52,900 --> 00:26:58,980
I want to ask them if they're going to do it, be really nice to them because they're

401
00:26:58,980 --> 00:27:00,540
actually being nice to us.

402
00:27:00,540 --> 00:27:05,660
No letters sending over to them like saying, �You bastards are shutting down the project!�

403
00:27:05,660 --> 00:27:06,660
No, be professional.

404
00:27:06,660 --> 00:27:07,660
Be professional.

405
00:27:07,660 --> 00:27:14,620
That is what you are going to say, and that is because Bivendi has owned those rights

406
00:27:14,620 --> 00:27:21,620
and they are on their right to protect them, and they have seen the work that we have been

407
00:27:21,620 --> 00:27:28,260
doing in King's Quest and now they are talking to us, but what is going to happen, I don't

408
00:27:28,260 --> 00:27:29,260
know.

409
00:27:29,260 --> 00:27:34,020
We'll just have to wait and see.

410
00:27:34,020 --> 00:27:37,860
Thank you so much for being on the show today, Cesar, and best of luck to you and your company,

411
00:27:37,860 --> 00:27:42,620
whether it be a King's Quest IX release or releasing this game as something else in the

412
00:27:42,620 --> 00:27:43,620
future.

413
00:27:43,620 --> 00:27:46,860
I hope it's successful, and best of luck to you guys.

414
00:27:46,860 --> 00:27:51,380
Thank you very much, and thank you very much for having me in the show.

415
00:27:51,380 --> 00:27:52,380
Not a problem.

416
00:27:52,380 --> 00:27:57,740
It was very interesting to hear from Cesar and Matt, both involved in different capacities,

417
00:27:57,740 --> 00:28:01,460
the community around the King's Quest games and what I think is really interesting about

418
00:28:01,460 --> 00:28:05,340
this whole thing is that there is a really solid community behind these King's Quest

419
00:28:05,340 --> 00:28:10,280
games and I think, you know, at least me, my personal thoughts on King's Quest is like

420
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:14,180
it was one of those games I always appreciated and I thought was so much fun and I always

421
00:28:14,180 --> 00:28:17,540
kind of wonder, gee, I wonder what ever happened to King's Quest, why did they stop making

422
00:28:17,540 --> 00:28:18,540
King's Quest games?

423
00:28:18,540 --> 00:28:22,300
I don't know, is it just me that's feeling that way or, I don't know.

424
00:28:22,300 --> 00:28:26,920
Why haven't they made most of the Sierra games? I mean a lot of them have disappeared just

425
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:30,500
I don't know, like Space Quest, Police Quest

426
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:34,740
The only one I can think of that came out was Leisure Suit Larry but that was kind of

427
00:28:34,740 --> 00:28:38,540
not the same thing at all and a god I hope

428
00:28:38,540 --> 00:28:41,580
I hope that if Avendi continues King's Quest it doesn't

429
00:28:41,580 --> 00:28:45,820
I hope they stick to what made King's Quest work and the formula that was good for the game

430
00:28:45,820 --> 00:28:48,860
but best of luck to these guys definitely so

431
00:28:48,860 --> 00:28:57,860
It's really neat to see the community come together like that, you know, no matter what community in game, what sub-community of the gaming culture it is.

432
00:28:57,860 --> 00:29:00,860
I just agree that the email should be kept constructive.

433
00:29:00,860 --> 00:29:07,860
Absolutely. You could do damaging stuff to this if you don't keep your emails professional, keep it professional.

434
00:29:07,860 --> 00:29:10,860
And we hope some of our listeners will choose to help these folks out.

435
00:29:10,860 --> 00:29:13,860
I think I'm going to write a letter myself because I would like to see this happen.

436
00:29:13,860 --> 00:29:17,380
least I want to see the King's Quest franchise continue you know in some way

437
00:29:17,380 --> 00:29:22,460
and I hope I hope these guys get their way anyway moving on one to bring up

438
00:29:22,460 --> 00:29:26,660
another story and it has to do with the Simpsons you know the TV show the

439
00:29:26,660 --> 00:29:31,540
Simpsons you know they've had all these games come out you know in the few years

440
00:29:31,540 --> 00:29:36,780
and they've been kind of a none of them have been that great really except maybe

441
00:29:36,780 --> 00:29:40,860
Simpsons hit and run but even that was kind of a well things are going to

442
00:29:40,860 --> 00:29:45,420
change because Electronic Arts just recently signed a deal with 20th Century

443
00:29:45,420 --> 00:29:50,760
Fox and Gracie Films which is going to give now EA the rights to produce the

444
00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:54,960
future Simpsons games so now you know EA is behind a lot of powerhouse games

445
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:57,820
they are going to be creating the Simpsons games now so what do you think

446
00:29:57,820 --> 00:30:01,940
good news for the Simpsons bad news for the Simpsons I don't play Simpsons games

447
00:30:01,940 --> 00:30:10,420
what can only wait and see can't be that bad I suppose but I don't know it's

448
00:30:10,420 --> 00:30:16,140
It's really, I can't really make distinction based on that because, who knows.

449
00:30:16,140 --> 00:30:20,720
But I would like to see less parodies of existing games, because that's kind of what the EA

450
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:23,860
franchise, or I mean not EA, the Simpsons franchise seems to have been built on the

451
00:30:23,860 --> 00:30:27,540
past couple games as parodies of existing, I kind of want to see less of that in something

452
00:30:27,540 --> 00:30:29,980
original like a Simpsons game.

453
00:30:29,980 --> 00:30:30,980
I don't know.

454
00:30:30,980 --> 00:30:33,100
Do you remember Bart's Nightmare on the Super Nintendo?

455
00:30:33,100 --> 00:30:38,420
I actually own that game, anyway, forget it.

456
00:30:38,420 --> 00:30:42,460
Some more details coming out this week on the brand new Super Mario Brothers.

457
00:30:42,460 --> 00:30:45,160
This is a game coming out for the Nintendo DS.

458
00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:51,360
It's going to have wireless two-player action as well as mini-games for up to four players,

459
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:54,440
and this is all coming out in the latest issue of Famitsu Magazine.

460
00:30:54,440 --> 00:31:00,160
Will it also include a playable copy of Mario Brothers, like every other Mario Brothers

461
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:02,160
game that it released on advance?

462
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:03,160
Oh yeah.

463
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:07,960
I don't know, although I can't see how it couldn't have it, but maybe they could make

464
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:13,680
a touch element in here I don't know so this is going to be a versus mode that

465
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:16,920
will be two players and you can't do four players in the versus mode that's

466
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:20,700
only for the minigames so this new Super Mario Brothers is going to use 3d

467
00:31:20,700 --> 00:31:25,080
graphics but it's like a side-scrolling game which I think is a great direction

468
00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:28,000
for the series I think it's a little weird it's coming out on DS and not an

469
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:32,520
actual system because I remember the first time I played the Mario level

470
00:31:32,520 --> 00:31:36,560
inside Super Smash Brothers Melee I was like damn they

471
00:31:36,560 --> 00:31:40,500
should make a game out of this this looks great and it plays wonderful

472
00:31:40,500 --> 00:31:45,080
I don't know so but it sounds like maybe they're kind of heading in this

473
00:31:45,080 --> 00:31:48,040
direction a little bit with the new Super Mario Brothers so I am kind of

474
00:31:48,040 --> 00:31:53,920
excited Loki what do you got for us tonight well not too much did want to

475
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:59,520
mention though there was a press release put out by 2k games the people behind

476
00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:05,160
Elder Scrolls 4 unfortunately it looks like the Elder Scrolls 4 has been pushed

477
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:14,360
back to the next fiscal year 4, take 2, that would mean somewhere around, I don't know,

478
00:32:14,360 --> 00:32:15,360
next year.

479
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:21,280
Unfortunately, after February, I believe the date I saw was like April or something.

480
00:32:21,280 --> 00:32:25,000
Very sad, because that was one of the games I was looking forward to.

481
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:30,200
The other thing about the 360 is it's been rumored and actually kind of starting to look

482
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:37,200
like it might actually be true now is Microsoft is purposefully shortening the allocations

483
00:32:37,420 --> 00:32:42,520
that each one of these stores is going to get to basically increase demand by having

484
00:32:42,520 --> 00:32:48,900
them sell out. I'm very disappointed that that's happening, but on our live show actually

485
00:32:48,900 --> 00:32:53,380
we found out there are some places that you can find 360s if you haven't ordered one yet

486
00:32:53,380 --> 00:32:59,660
or really need to get one on launch day. One of the places being Toys R Us is actually

487
00:32:59,660 --> 00:33:03,540
doing pre-orders on them, you have to do a bundle, but it's with a couple games, but

488
00:33:03,540 --> 00:33:06,540
I mean everyone's going to be picking up a couple games anyways.

489
00:33:06,540 --> 00:33:12,340
And also stores like Target and Best Buy are going to be opening up at six in the morning.

490
00:33:12,340 --> 00:33:16,660
Best Buy rumored to have a larger allocation than most other stores because supposedly

491
00:33:16,660 --> 00:33:22,700
Bill Gates is going to be pimping the 360 in the Manhattan Best Buy.

492
00:33:22,700 --> 00:33:28,580
You know, I played one of those Xbox 360 kiosks at Best Buy over the week, and I don't know.

493
00:33:28,580 --> 00:33:32,000
I don't know if I feel the need to get one of these on launch day anymore, I think it

494
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,040
just might be too much hype for me.

495
00:33:34,040 --> 00:33:36,500
I don't think the games...

496
00:33:36,500 --> 00:33:37,500
I don't know.

497
00:33:37,500 --> 00:33:40,540
It's hard to say because it was only a couple games and I didn't get to play them very long,

498
00:33:40,540 --> 00:33:42,720
but I'm feeling a little iffy on this.

499
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:45,260
I don't know if this is one of those like have to have on launch day things.

500
00:33:45,260 --> 00:33:48,780
I don't really feel like putting up with all this shortage crap to get one right away.

501
00:33:48,780 --> 00:33:49,780
I don't know.

502
00:33:49,780 --> 00:33:51,020
I don't know how I feel about it now.

503
00:33:51,020 --> 00:33:54,340
Well, I've already got mine ordered, so...

504
00:33:54,340 --> 00:33:58,200
I'm hoping, I've got to check with them tomorrow because I'm going to go in and buy some more

505
00:33:58,200 --> 00:34:05,220
stuff to see if I'm actually getting it on launch day or not because it, I don't know,

506
00:34:05,220 --> 00:34:06,220
it's iffy.

507
00:34:06,220 --> 00:34:09,720
And I'm going to be very disappointed if I don't because I did pre-order mine way in

508
00:34:09,720 --> 00:34:14,020
advance and I've heard people that pre-ordered it back in June when they didn't even have

509
00:34:14,020 --> 00:34:19,280
two SKUs available and even they aren't getting one on launch.

510
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:23,560
But then again, that was an employee so things are going to get ugly.

511
00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:28,220
Things are going to get ugly, and you know, I'm kind of hoping, you know, that if this

512
00:34:28,220 --> 00:34:32,380
all pans out, you know, like it is where there's tons of shortages, all we need is another

513
00:34:32,380 --> 00:34:35,500
company like Sony or Nintendo to go, hey, guess what?

514
00:34:35,500 --> 00:34:39,820
Our system's coming out in a few months here, you know, pick one up if you're pissed off

515
00:34:39,820 --> 00:34:42,380
with this stuff, you know, we're going to have better games anyways or something.

516
00:34:42,380 --> 00:34:43,780
It'll be interesting, we'll see.

517
00:34:43,780 --> 00:34:50,520
All right, anyway, let's go over to Dark Sakura and see what news she has for us tonight.

518
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:56,760
First of all, the new images for Silent Hill, the movie, have been posted on IGN.

519
00:34:56,760 --> 00:34:58,760
Ooh, there's another movie.

520
00:34:58,760 --> 00:35:00,640
We've said this on many previous episodes.

521
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:02,840
Very excited about the Silent Hill movie.

522
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:05,800
It's uh, yeah, it looks like Silent Hill.

523
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:07,640
It's very, very Silent Hill.

524
00:35:07,640 --> 00:35:13,800
I mean, the outfits, just, it's really hard for me to really explain it unless you go

525
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:17,320
and look at the images and it looks like it's right from the game.

526
00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:22,160
you sure that they're not pictures of Silent Hill 5 on the PlayStation 3 no

527
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:26,440
because PlayStation 3 doesn't look at that realistic all right but these are

528
00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:33,840
good shots very good also for our European listeners I have some news

529
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:42,160
about the DS Wi-Fi connection hotspots mmm 7500 actually says over 7500 Wi-Fi

530
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:47,240
connection hotspots will be active in the UK from November 25th when Mario

531
00:35:47,240 --> 00:35:52,960
cart DS launches there. It's actually the surface is going to be rolling out of

532
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:57,960
the rest of Europe at that time. Places included McDonald's, Coffee Republic,

533
00:35:57,960 --> 00:36:04,480
Hilton, Ramada Jarvis Hotels, Road Chef, Welcome Break, First Great Western

535
00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:13,720
football stadiums, British Library, Canary Wharf. Where can't you go to get on?

536
00:36:13,720 --> 00:36:14,720
All over the place.

537
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:15,720
All over the place.

538
00:36:15,720 --> 00:36:16,720
All over the place.

539
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:17,720
What about McDonald's?

540
00:36:17,720 --> 00:36:18,720
Because, you know, that was big news here.

541
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:20,720
I said that was the first thing I listed.

542
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:21,720
Oh, I'm sorry.

543
00:36:21,720 --> 00:36:22,720
I missed that.

544
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:23,720
Sorry.

545
00:36:23,720 --> 00:36:30,720
But there's a, it was basically a, if our UK listeners want to see a little bit more

546
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:41,200
on that, if you go to www.thecloud.net or www.btopenzone.com, there's some Wi-Fi hotspot

547
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:47,140
maps there games also that another one mentioned that's available for the plan

548
00:36:47,140 --> 00:36:50,080
that of course is Tony Hawk's American skate land which will be released over

549
00:36:50,080 --> 00:36:56,400
there on November 18th speaking of release dates I have release dates cool

550
00:36:56,400 --> 00:37:02,080
I'm sorry I you know missed the other week that's all right of course a

551
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:07,600
twisted metal head-on came out xenosaga episode 2 came out coming out on the

00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:34,120
Path of Neo, WWE Smackdown vs Raw 2006.

556
00:37:34,120 --> 00:37:37,480
There's a lot, a lot of games coming out soon.

557
00:37:37,480 --> 00:37:38,480
Good stuff.

558
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:43,680
Kind of on the same vein, I actually was pulled up a calendar that shows what Nintendo's got

559
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:47,320
planned for the first quarter and next year, and there's some really exciting titles coming

560
00:37:47,320 --> 00:37:48,320
out.

561
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:54,960
Electroplankton is out on January 9th, True Swing Golf out January 23rd, and Super Princess

562
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:55,960
Peach, also.

563
00:37:55,960 --> 00:37:56,960
Looking forward to that.

564
00:37:56,960 --> 00:37:59,240
Yeah, it should be very interesting.

565
00:37:59,240 --> 00:38:03,760
It's kind of a girl power type game, but as long as it's not done cheesy, it should be,

566
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:07,220
has the potential to be really good. I mean, I know a lot of people that will pick Peach

567
00:38:07,220 --> 00:38:09,260
in Mario Party, just to dominate.

568
00:38:09,260 --> 00:38:13,140
Just to point out a few more of the notables coming out this month, uh, Dr. Mario and Tetris

569
00:38:13,140 --> 00:38:18,940
Attack on the Game Boy Advance on the 25th, Soul Calibur 3 on the 18th, Sonic Rush on

570
00:38:18,940 --> 00:38:25,620
the 18th, Pokemon XD Gale of Darkness on the 18th, and Namco Museum Battle Collection.

571
00:38:25,620 --> 00:38:27,620
Also coming out of Half-Life 2 on Xbox.

572
00:38:27,620 --> 00:38:32,580
I was going to say that the, oh damn I just lost it.

573
00:38:32,580 --> 00:38:36,140
Yeah well I know those are the UK dates.

574
00:38:36,140 --> 00:38:41,260
The thing is, I was going to say, I saw a ton of big games kind of this week, especially

575
00:38:41,260 --> 00:38:45,420
The Matrix and stuff. I was surprised to see that they're getting the

576
00:38:45,420 --> 00:38:49,220
SmackDown vs. Raw before us, which is kind of neat.

577
00:38:49,220 --> 00:38:53,340
I didn't think wrestling was as big of a deal anywhere else but here.

578
00:38:53,340 --> 00:38:57,580
I know. News to me. It's interesting. Actually I found another notable

579
00:38:57,580 --> 00:38:59,980
Shadow the Hedgehog on the 25th.

580
00:38:59,980 --> 00:39:07,980
The other thing I was going to mention though, is Electroplankton I heard is only going to be available online or in the Nintendo Manhattan store.

581
00:39:07,980 --> 00:39:11,780
So, you're not going to be able to find it in your local retailer.

582
00:39:11,780 --> 00:39:17,780
I have heard that same thing, that it's only going to be available online, which is a very strange way to sell the game.

583
00:39:17,780 --> 00:39:23,780
I don't know if they're trying to make a collector's item out of it or what, but we'll see.

584
00:39:23,780 --> 00:39:27,280
I know I'm gonna pick it up. I'm definitely interested in electroplankton.

585
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:31,680
Looks like a fun game. So, anyway, Dark Sakura, looks like

586
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:36,040
you've got to run and go save the

587
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:39,200
save the planet from invaders or something right now, so.

588
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:42,720
Or at least save myself from

589
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:46,240
an F in Dreamweaver class.

590
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:49,920
Well, your final thought for our listeners tonight, Dark Sakura?

591
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:53,040
Do your homework. Do it early in the week.

592
00:39:53,040 --> 00:40:00,600
Alright, moving on, I want to talk about the PSP, because I just talked a few minutes ago

593
00:40:00,600 --> 00:40:03,600
about the DS games coming out first quarter, well here's something that's going to be coming

594
00:40:03,600 --> 00:40:09,720
out for the PSP in not too long, it's going to be a Gradius collection, it's coming out

595
00:40:09,720 --> 00:40:16,800
on February 9th, and it's Gradius Portable, it's a compilation of Gradius 1-4 and Gradius

596
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:17,800
Gaiden.

597
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:21,960
It's going to be coming out, it's a straight port of the previous games, but they're going

598
00:40:21,960 --> 00:40:27,300
to be adding a few bonus features as well and also you can stretch to the

599
00:40:27,300 --> 00:40:31,020
widescreen otherwise you can just play in its original aspect ratio so the game

600
00:40:31,020 --> 00:40:34,140
doesn't look all stretched but you can you have the choice to do it either way

601
00:40:34,140 --> 00:40:36,940
I thought it wasn't actually stretched I thought there were new versions of the

602
00:40:36,940 --> 00:40:43,260
game available there were in the widescreen mode um I Oh grottius one and

603
00:40:43,260 --> 00:40:47,020
two will have the widescreen mode so well grottius one and two will the other

604
00:40:47,020 --> 00:40:56,020
ones not so much. Now here's the biggest thing that's going to come with this, a save feature.

605
00:40:56,020 --> 00:41:01,100
So no more getting all the way to level 6 and losing all your lives in the end. You

606
00:41:01,100 --> 00:41:06,420
know what's kind of interesting about that? No Salamander or Life Force as it is.

607
00:41:06,420 --> 00:41:08,620
No Wi-Fi 2 player either.

608
00:41:08,620 --> 00:41:13,180
Yeah, too bad. Maybe for the sequel, maybe that's what they're holding out on, who knows.

609
00:41:13,180 --> 00:41:14,620
Loki, what else you got for us?

610
00:41:14,620 --> 00:41:20,220
Well, speaking of the PSP, the PSP2TV, I believe,

611
00:41:20,220 --> 00:41:22,580
was launched this week, or I should

612
00:41:22,580 --> 00:41:24,860
say is launching this week.

613
00:41:24,860 --> 00:41:26,940
They have had a few videos coming out

614
00:41:26,940 --> 00:41:29,220
showing how to install this thing.

615
00:41:29,220 --> 00:41:33,020
And oh my god, this is not for your average user of a PSP.

616
00:41:33,020 --> 00:41:35,440
You have to literally disassemble the entire thing,

617
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:38,220
rip the guts out, put new guts back in, and you're done.

618
00:41:38,220 --> 00:41:41,220
And it's just not pretty.

619
00:41:41,220 --> 00:41:47,580
But if you are out there and you want to spend $120 to pick this thing up, it does look pretty

620
00:41:47,580 --> 00:41:48,580
cool.

621
00:41:48,580 --> 00:41:54,540
The graphics don't look that bad, but damn, it's definitely voiding the warranty on this

622
00:41:54,540 --> 00:41:55,540
thing.

623
00:41:55,540 --> 00:41:57,100
You have to have an electronics degree to be able to put this together.

624
00:41:57,100 --> 00:42:02,900
Well, you know, it's actually all screws and no actually soldering or anything like that,

625
00:42:02,900 --> 00:42:09,300
but you are unhooking some ribbon cables and stuff that are very, very delicate and it's

626
00:42:09,300 --> 00:42:14,000
not for your average consumer to be able to do this stuff. Now granted, if you do want

627
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:19,560
to have some TV support and you're not willing to break open your PSP, there are some other

628
00:42:19,560 --> 00:42:23,720
options coming out. One being, it's kind of like this thing that sticks over the entire

629
00:42:23,720 --> 00:42:28,500
screen and basically captures the video from the image. I'm not going to say that that's

630
00:42:28,500 --> 00:42:33,440
going to be probably that great of a picture, but you know, that's another option out there

631
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:38,600
for you. The other thing which is interesting is there's a company working on mod chips

632
00:42:38,600 --> 00:42:41,720
right now they're supposed to be released in a few weeks here for the PSP

633
00:42:41,720 --> 00:42:45,320
the first and they're going to be sold on eBay starting off in the price on

634
00:42:45,320 --> 00:42:49,320
those supposed to be about 25 bucks so that would be interesting to check out

635
00:42:49,320 --> 00:42:54,960
and supposedly it will allow homebrew that we run on any version of the PSP

636
00:42:54,960 --> 00:42:59,320
now on the same note as homebrew running on any version PSP there's this brand

637
00:42:59,320 --> 00:43:04,920
new software coming out called PSP advanced and it's basically a video

638
00:43:04,920 --> 00:43:10,800
software, kind of very similar to iTunes where you can play any, most video formats and most

639
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:11,800
audio formats.

640
00:43:11,800 --> 00:43:17,760
The thing that's interesting about this though is it's going to run on any version firmware

641
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:21,880
and they're saying that it might be on a UMD or something like that, but there's also a

642
00:43:21,880 --> 00:43:23,280
part that's on your memory stick.

643
00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:28,340
Yeah, that's going to be exploited to run any homebrew, that's what's going to happen.

644
00:43:28,340 --> 00:43:34,560
So pretty soon, firmware might not be an issue anymore of running home, Bruce.

645
00:43:34,560 --> 00:43:35,560
Very interesting.

646
00:43:35,560 --> 00:43:37,580
Very interesting.

647
00:43:37,580 --> 00:43:40,700
Usually throughout the Orange Launch Radio To Go show, we would open up the mailbag and

648
00:43:40,700 --> 00:43:42,060
go to what you guys have to say.

649
00:43:42,060 --> 00:43:46,100
Unfortunately, our internet in the studio is down right now, so we're unable to access

650
00:43:46,100 --> 00:43:47,100
our mailbag.

651
00:43:47,100 --> 00:43:48,100
Isn't that convenient?

652
00:43:48,100 --> 00:43:49,540
So we're going to have to table that to next week.

653
00:43:49,540 --> 00:43:55,040
However, if you have some emails you want to send us, togo, T-O-G-O, at orangelaunchradio.com

654
00:43:55,040 --> 00:43:58,880
is the address you want to use and we definitely always like to hear what you guys have to

655
00:43:58,880 --> 00:44:01,440
say and Dark Sakura is always in there looking at the email back.

656
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:05,280
I've actually started helping her out recently too so I go in there sometimes as well because

657
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:08,560
there's just so many of you guys with so many nice things to say so keep them coming.

658
00:44:08,560 --> 00:44:09,560
We like getting emails.

659
00:44:09,560 --> 00:44:10,560
Doesn't everybody?

660
00:44:10,560 --> 00:44:14,000
So we usually try to send one back because we know people like getting emails.

661
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:16,600
All right, what else you got, Loki?

662
00:44:16,600 --> 00:44:23,040
Well, the other things I was going to talk about, more of kind of the rumor control stuff.

663
00:44:23,040 --> 00:44:28,320
Someone was saying, or actually they were rumored to have a, that Microsoft was thinking

664
00:44:28,320 --> 00:44:34,420
about doing an Xbox portable, I don't think that's going to happen anytime soon.

665
00:44:34,420 --> 00:44:44,180
So anyways, beyond that, this kind of ties in with some portable stuff, it's really interesting.

666
00:44:44,180 --> 00:44:53,620
There's this UK site, Britishgaming.co.uk, they posted an article about a Resident Evil

667
00:44:53,620 --> 00:44:54,620
game.

668
00:44:54,620 --> 00:45:01,520
It's basically an online game that's made to look like one of those old Game & Watch

669
00:45:01,520 --> 00:45:03,640
games, which is kind of interesting.

670
00:45:03,640 --> 00:45:09,940
With the little LCD games, or whatever, the burn-in pictures, okay.

671
00:45:09,940 --> 00:45:15,580
And supposedly it's a mini-game promotion where you control Leon and you try to knife

672
00:45:15,580 --> 00:45:24,020
50 or more chainsaw-wielding maniacs, which look like little heads with a stick.

673
00:45:24,020 --> 00:45:25,380
So it's kind of interesting.

674
00:45:25,380 --> 00:45:28,540
You can find that at BritishGaming.co.uk.

675
00:45:28,540 --> 00:45:31,260
Will it have the same bad voice acting as the first game had?

676
00:45:31,260 --> 00:45:33,020
I don't know about that, but...

677
00:45:33,020 --> 00:45:36,060
It sounds like it's based off RE4, so I guess not.

678
00:45:36,060 --> 00:45:38,420
Yeah, probably not.

679
00:45:38,420 --> 00:45:44,940
The other things, there's been tons of pictures, especially with the Xbox lounge in Japan,

680
00:45:44,940 --> 00:45:48,220
of new face plates coming out for the 360.

681
00:45:48,220 --> 00:45:52,300
I'm going to be the first to say that face plates for the 360 is the most retarded idea

682
00:45:52,300 --> 00:45:54,660
I've ever seen.

683
00:45:54,660 --> 00:45:59,900
I don't get it myself, but at the same time, well the Game Boy Micro, I don't really get

684
00:45:59,900 --> 00:46:02,020
that either with the whole face plate customization.

685
00:46:02,020 --> 00:46:06,220
It seems to be this interesting trend, but okay, whatever, it may not be for me, but

686
00:46:06,220 --> 00:46:09,980
some people are into this whole customize, you know if people customize their car, they

687
00:46:09,980 --> 00:46:10,980
might want to customize their console.

688
00:46:10,980 --> 00:46:11,980
Exactly.

689
00:46:11,980 --> 00:46:12,980
I don't know.

690
00:46:12,980 --> 00:46:17,540
Well, if you're into faceplates, you can definitely pick some up for your most, you know, consumer

691
00:46:17,540 --> 00:46:18,540
hoarded products.

692
00:46:18,540 --> 00:46:22,180
For example, Star Wars Episode III, they've got three different faceplates that will be

693
00:46:22,180 --> 00:46:23,180
available.

694
00:46:23,180 --> 00:46:24,180
These are official.

695
00:46:24,180 --> 00:46:28,740
These are official, and they're, like most faceplates, they're going to be about fourteen

696
00:46:28,740 --> 00:46:29,740
nights.

697
00:46:29,740 --> 00:46:32,900
But all that, see, I don't know if I dig those, because the only one that's kind of cool is

698
00:46:32,900 --> 00:46:37,180
that first one in the picture where it's them dueling in the lava from episode 3, but the

699
00:46:37,180 --> 00:46:42,060
other ones, like the one that looks inspired by the classic Star Wars films, all the controller

700
00:46:42,060 --> 00:46:46,040
ports and stuff are running through the people's faces, so you can't even really see clearly

701
00:46:46,040 --> 00:46:46,960
what it is.

702
00:46:46,960 --> 00:46:51,260
You're like, I think, is black rain coming down on the Star Wars cast?

703
00:46:51,260 --> 00:46:52,580
Because it's hard to see.

704
00:46:52,580 --> 00:46:53,580
I don't know.

705
00:46:53,580 --> 00:46:54,580
Whatever.

706
00:46:54,580 --> 00:47:01,460
So they have World of Worlds themed stuff, Adidas, MTV's G-Spot, just a bunch of weird

707
00:47:01,460 --> 00:47:02,460
shit.

708
00:47:02,460 --> 00:47:06,580
That's all going to be available at some point. I'm sure you'll see these in your

709
00:47:06,580 --> 00:47:09,900
major retail stores. I think I'll stick with the standard white

710
00:47:09,900 --> 00:47:14,260
faceplate. No, I like the idea of faceplates, like they showed a Project Off from Racing 3 one.

711
00:47:14,260 --> 00:47:18,140
Maybe included with like a special edition of the game. That might be something cool to

712
00:47:18,140 --> 00:47:19,220
give away, but

713
00:47:19,220 --> 00:47:23,140
I'm not going to spend $15 to buy something when, especially

714
00:47:23,140 --> 00:47:26,660
if I'm going to buy a faceplate, it's going to be a blank one that I can design myself.

715
00:47:26,660 --> 00:47:30,060
And you know there's going to be a website. You know there's a Star Wars nut out there that can't wait to

716
00:47:30,060 --> 00:47:31,060
spend the $15 on this.

717
00:47:31,060 --> 00:47:35,700
Well, these are the same people who buy those Star Wars themed Alienware PCs because they

718
00:47:35,700 --> 00:47:39,300
have the Star Wars stuff on the side.

719
00:47:39,300 --> 00:47:42,820
Anyways, moving on from there.

720
00:47:42,820 --> 00:47:51,220
The other thing is this week actually, Newsweek interviewed Miyamoto talking about what we

721
00:47:51,220 --> 00:47:56,180
can look forward to seeing in the revolution and where he sees gaming kind of going from

722
00:47:56,180 --> 00:47:57,180
there.

723
00:47:57,180 --> 00:48:04,420
Both comments that he made though was saying that he always envisioned that the console

724
00:48:04,420 --> 00:48:11,180
games would break out of the on a screen type of thing and basically fill up an entire room.

725
00:48:11,180 --> 00:48:14,900
You made a very interesting blog post about this, so you kind of came to a conclusion

726
00:48:14,900 --> 00:48:15,900
from this, huh?

727
00:48:15,900 --> 00:48:18,880
Well, I'm not the only one that's come to this conclusion.

728
00:48:18,880 --> 00:48:26,020
It's basically that one of the things was that Show West this year, they were showing

729
00:48:26,020 --> 00:48:27,940
off the brand new 3D technology.

730
00:48:27,940 --> 00:48:30,500
Which is a movie convention, not a game convention, a movie house convention.

731
00:48:30,500 --> 00:48:31,500
Movie house convention.

732
00:48:31,500 --> 00:48:34,900
It's going to be, they're pushing, this is going to be the next format of theaters.

733
00:48:34,900 --> 00:48:37,020
This is what's going to drive people back into theaters.

734
00:48:37,020 --> 00:48:40,900
It's going to be these stereoscopic 3D movies.

735
00:48:40,900 --> 00:48:43,180
Everything you see is going to be 3D.

736
00:48:43,180 --> 00:48:48,700
Well, Robert Rodriguez and Peter Jackson, all of them, were saying, I believe it was

737
00:48:48,700 --> 00:48:53,120
Robert Rodriguez that commented saying that you're going to be seeing these in the theaters

738
00:48:53,120 --> 00:48:58,760
the next coming years, but one game company has beat us to it, to the market, but you

739
00:48:58,760 --> 00:49:02,360
know, you're going to see these things rolling out of the theaters soon.

740
00:49:02,360 --> 00:49:07,920
Well from what I can tell so far, Xbox obviously is not going to have anything for it, Sony

741
00:49:07,920 --> 00:49:11,900
doesn't have anything for it, they've also demoed something on the GameCube that was

742
00:49:11,900 --> 00:49:18,520
at E3 a couple years ago showing a stereoscopic 3D plug-in for it, what do you think is going

743
00:49:18,520 --> 00:49:19,520
to be?

744
00:49:19,520 --> 00:49:24,320
So that combined with Miyamoto's comment about, you know, off the screen.

745
00:49:24,320 --> 00:49:29,320
And he says that he wants it to basically take up the entire room.

746
00:49:29,320 --> 00:49:33,500
And you think about that controller, which is a very 3D controller, and he said, this

747
00:49:33,500 --> 00:49:38,280
is all I can say about this at this time.

748
00:49:38,280 --> 00:49:41,980
To me, I think one of these things that they're going to announce, and I honestly think that

749
00:49:41,980 --> 00:49:45,360
everything about the revolution hasn't been said yet, I know that they've got stuff up

750
00:49:45,360 --> 00:49:49,220
their sleeves that they haven't said yet because everyone's really excited about it.

751
00:49:49,220 --> 00:49:54,320
I think that stereoscopic 3D as you know a standard for the system I think is going to

752
00:49:54,320 --> 00:49:55,320
be possible.

753
00:49:55,320 --> 00:49:59,540
Now one of the things that they threw out someone was suggesting was a portable projection

754
00:49:59,540 --> 00:50:04,220
screen that would do stereoscopic 3D without glasses which I don't know if that can be

755
00:50:04,220 --> 00:50:05,860
pulled off.

756
00:50:05,860 --> 00:50:11,540
As long as it's not something that's hoarded in all the games because that can make you

757
00:50:11,540 --> 00:50:14,340
very sick from doing something like that for too long.

758
00:50:14,340 --> 00:50:17,740
It's got to be something that's only once in a while you know.

759
00:50:17,740 --> 00:50:20,820
I don't know, like minigames or something, because I don't know, I would think that that

760
00:50:20,820 --> 00:50:27,420
would make you sick, unless they found a way for the body to get adjusted to the 3D more.

761
00:50:27,420 --> 00:50:31,680
But again, I guess if I had the time to sit through Captain EO when I was a kid, which

762
00:50:31,680 --> 00:50:34,460
is similar in a way, I would have the time for a game.

763
00:50:34,460 --> 00:50:38,940
But I think though, I mean, Nintendo's known for gimmicky stuff, now granted this is not

764
00:50:38,940 --> 00:50:43,180
really gimmicky, this is like the next stage in what, you know, cinema and stuff is going

765
00:50:43,180 --> 00:50:45,100
to happen, and you know...

766
00:50:45,100 --> 00:50:47,100
One step closer to a holodeck, really.

767
00:50:47,100 --> 00:50:54,100
seriously and I would think a 3D mouse or a 3D controller like that, it makes sense.

768
00:50:54,660 --> 00:50:58,280
It's just, you know, I'd be really surprised if they didn't do this and this really is

769
00:50:58,280 --> 00:51:01,480
making sense that this is the direction it's going to go and I think we're going to find

770
00:51:01,480 --> 00:51:05,680
out more once they've come up with these press conferences talking about it because this

771
00:51:05,680 --> 00:51:10,680
right here, once the Playstation 3 comes out and all that stuff, this is really going to

772
00:51:10,680 --> 00:51:15,640
set them apart. Whether their specs may not be as powerful as the other systems, it's

773
00:51:15,640 --> 00:51:19,780
It's not going to matter anymore, they're going to be in their own category, they're

774
00:51:19,780 --> 00:51:21,960
just going to be set apart from everybody else.

775
00:51:21,960 --> 00:51:24,440
Which would be revolutionary.

776
00:51:24,440 --> 00:51:30,120
And I think it would put them back on, you know, in the lead basically.

777
00:51:30,120 --> 00:51:33,200
Interesting theories, we'll see if any of them come true.

778
00:51:33,200 --> 00:51:35,000
Anything else for us tonight, Loki?

779
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:39,540
Well that's pretty much, you know, what I've got is all the important stuff I hit up on.

780
00:51:39,540 --> 00:51:45,520
This month is going to be really crazy as far as games coming out, it's really a doozy.

781
00:51:45,520 --> 00:51:51,240
Especially with next week, the week of the 14th, there's way too much stuff coming out,

782
00:51:51,240 --> 00:51:55,760
way too much stuff, and then you've got the 360 launch, it's got to be a busy month.

783
00:51:55,760 --> 00:52:00,480
Well, it's that time of year when we're getting into Christmas and stuff, so not a surprise.

784
00:52:00,480 --> 00:52:06,400
Oh, and the other thing is Advent Children, it's supposed to be on the 10th, date's still

785
00:52:06,400 --> 00:52:10,760
to be announced now, again, that thing keeps getting pushed back further and further.

786
00:52:10,760 --> 00:52:14,360
Because they have to think of a way to get people to buy the UMD or DVD now because everybody's

787
00:52:14,360 --> 00:52:18,600
pirated it off the internet not everybody but you know they definitely

788
00:52:18,600 --> 00:52:22,160
took a hit by that getting leaked out and everything so they need of course

789
00:52:22,160 --> 00:52:24,960
they shouldn't have released it in one place way before they released it in

790
00:52:24,960 --> 00:52:29,200
another I don't know maybe that's just me anyway I'm just a couple more stories

791
00:52:29,200 --> 00:52:32,880
for you guys tonight I want to talk about Metal Gear acid 2 now you know in

792
00:52:32,880 --> 00:52:36,800
the previous Metal Gear games there's usually been some type of like fan based

793
00:52:36,800 --> 00:52:41,480
competition for instance you could be a dog tag in Metal Gear Solid 2 or there

794
00:52:41,480 --> 00:52:45,520
was like a camouflage design competition that they did for Metal Gear Solid 3, well now

795
00:52:45,520 --> 00:52:50,520
what they're doing is a card creation competition for Metal Gear Acid 2. So if you think you

796
00:52:50,520 --> 00:52:57,880
have a name for a card, an image file, a card type and card information, and something that

797
00:52:57,880 --> 00:53:02,460
goes around the Metal Gear and Kojima theme, now it can't be a crossover, like you can't

798
00:53:02,460 --> 00:53:07,580
have a DDR card or something from another Konami game, no Goemon or anything. And it

799
00:53:07,580 --> 00:53:12,100
has to be something realistic that would actually work in the game.

800
00:53:12,100 --> 00:53:15,460
Check out some of the various gaming websites, because they're running competitions.

801
00:53:15,460 --> 00:53:20,760
Also check out Konami's site to design cards for Metal Gear Acid 2, and some of them are

802
00:53:20,760 --> 00:53:25,300
going to turn up in the final game, so those of you creative folks might want to go check

803
00:53:25,300 --> 00:53:26,300
that out.

804
00:53:26,300 --> 00:53:27,300
That is pretty awesome.

805
00:53:27,300 --> 00:53:31,660
I'm also glad to see that they're actually going to be bringing a Metal Gear Solid type

806
00:53:31,660 --> 00:53:33,300
game to the PSP.

807
00:53:33,300 --> 00:53:37,340
It's not going to be just the smell of your acid anymore, which is nice.

808
00:53:37,340 --> 00:53:41,180
Alright, now last story for you guys tonight.

809
00:53:41,180 --> 00:53:42,180
This is kind of interesting.

810
00:53:42,180 --> 00:53:45,460
Usually we end with a funny story, but this is not a funny story.

811
00:53:45,460 --> 00:53:50,080
This is just kind of one of those gaming culture stories.

812
00:53:50,080 --> 00:53:55,040
There was actually in China, this is something that was being reported on Yahoo News China,

813
00:53:55,040 --> 00:53:58,980
there was a character in World of Warcraft, well not really a character because it was

814
00:53:58,980 --> 00:54:01,020
a human that was playing this of course.

815
00:54:01,020 --> 00:54:05,820
name of the character was Snowly. This person died after playing World of

816
00:54:05,820 --> 00:54:09,760
Warcraft for several days straight during a national holiday. Well, they had

817
00:54:09,760 --> 00:54:16,620
an online funeral service to basically commemorate the week anniversary of this

818
00:54:16,620 --> 00:54:21,840
person passing away and what's very interesting is if you look at the screen

819
00:54:21,840 --> 00:54:27,140
capture it's very solemn. It just shows all these characters kind of sitting and

820
00:54:27,140 --> 00:54:29,940
it kind of looks like they're all bowing their heads and they're all in these

821
00:54:29,940 --> 00:54:36,600
very neat lines so it's kind of I don't know it's very sad to see so but it was

822
00:54:36,600 --> 00:54:41,220
it's just very interesting to see the community coming together like that to

823
00:54:41,220 --> 00:54:45,820
honor somebody who is playing among them but it also just goes to show please

824
00:54:45,820 --> 00:54:51,100
please game in moderation especially with these MMOs you know play for an

825
00:54:51,100 --> 00:54:56,220
hour but then take a good 10-minute break go outside get some air lift some

826
00:54:56,220 --> 00:55:01,760
weights, do something. It doesn't always have to be 100% about the games. It can

827
00:55:01,760 --> 00:55:07,260
be 90% about the games, you know. And finally, where would we be in a

828
00:55:07,260 --> 00:55:12,660
podcast without mentioning Jack Thompson? Oh, just when I thought it was over.

829
00:55:12,660 --> 00:55:18,880
Okay, so what's going on is there's a homicide case that's actually, you know,

830
00:55:18,880 --> 00:55:22,060
of course with a kid and, you know, they're using the Grand Theft Auto as

831
00:55:22,060 --> 00:55:23,820
saying that's the thing.

832
00:55:23,820 --> 00:55:26,980
Well, one of the parts that the defense has actually

833
00:55:26,980 --> 00:55:30,300
kind of turned the tables on is they're

834
00:55:30,300 --> 00:55:32,940
questioning Jack Thompson's ability

835
00:55:32,940 --> 00:55:34,780
to practice law in this state.

836
00:55:34,780 --> 00:55:37,820
And they're actually questioning his character now.

837
00:55:37,820 --> 00:55:39,620
And so Jack Thompson's, in a sense,

838
00:55:39,620 --> 00:55:42,500
going to be put on trial, which should be interesting.

839
00:55:42,500 --> 00:55:44,500
They're actually going to try to get him barred.

840
00:55:44,500 --> 00:55:48,660
I think it's from, I want to say it's from Georgia,

841
00:55:48,660 --> 00:55:51,060
from practicing law in Georgia.

842
00:55:51,060 --> 00:55:58,180
I know this is really sophomoric, but only one word comes to mind right now.

843
00:55:58,180 --> 00:56:05,660
So it's interesting, but sooner or later they're going to find out this guy's a quack.

844
00:56:05,660 --> 00:56:08,740
All right, that's going to do it for another edition of Orange Lounge Radio To Go.

845
00:56:08,740 --> 00:56:12,200
Check out our website, by the way, www.orangeloungeradio.com.

846
00:56:12,200 --> 00:56:15,100
We look forward to seeing what you guys have to say on the forums.

847
00:56:15,100 --> 00:56:18,900
And also, our forums did this this week, which I think is very interesting.

848
00:56:18,900 --> 00:56:22,500
We're trying to put together this map to see where all the Orange Lounge radio listeners

849
00:56:22,500 --> 00:56:23,500
live.

850
00:56:23,500 --> 00:56:24,500
It's a frapper map.

851
00:56:24,500 --> 00:56:25,500
So check that out.

852
00:56:25,500 --> 00:56:26,500
That's on our forums.

853
00:56:26,500 --> 00:56:28,500
It's F-R-A-P-P-E-R, I think.

854
00:56:28,500 --> 00:56:30,260
I can't tell because our internet is down right now.

855
00:56:30,260 --> 00:56:31,260
It's recording.

856
00:56:31,260 --> 00:56:32,260
Yeah.

857
00:56:32,260 --> 00:56:33,820
So check that out or on our forums.

858
00:56:33,820 --> 00:56:35,140
Of course, the link is there.

859
00:56:35,140 --> 00:56:41,300
So check that out and plot yourself on the map and show us what regional areas we should

860
00:56:41,300 --> 00:56:42,300
be covering more.

861
00:56:42,300 --> 00:56:47,260
And also this week, I believe, Jamie's going to the podcast awards.

862
00:56:47,260 --> 00:56:48,260
Yes.

863
00:56:48,260 --> 00:56:51,020
that a little early in the show she won't be here next week because the

864
00:56:51,020 --> 00:56:57,860
podcast awards but she'll be having fun I'm very envious oh well but you know

872
00:57:28,860 --> 00:57:33,660
going on with all that Loki and Dark Sakura being on the local news my final

873
00:57:33,660 --> 00:57:38,700
thought is I need zinc and vitamin C because I think I'm coming down with a

874
00:57:38,700 --> 00:57:43,860
cold and it's time to end this show because it's just making me sicker I get

to be sick. Thank you guys very much for listening and supporting Orange Lounge Radio. We appreciate
