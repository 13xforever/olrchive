Monkey, monkey, monkey, monkey, a monkey, monkey, monkey, I'm gonna be a monkey, a monkey, monkey, monkey, would you like to be one too?

00:13.000 --> 00:17.000
Okay, if you wanna be a monkey, you gotta learn to act like a monkey.

00:18.000 --> 00:23.000
And I've got to know how, cause I've seen every garden movie ever made.

00:24.000 --> 00:26.000
So watch and learn!

00:26.000 --> 00:36.000

It's called I'm a Cucumber. Here we go. One, two, three, four.

00:41.000 --> 00:49.000
I'm a cucumber. I'm a cucumber. I'm a cucumber. I'm a cucumber.

00:49.000 --> 00:56.960
I'm a cucumber, I'm a cucumber, please don't take me to the pickle farm, bum!

00:56.960 --> 01:02.060
Ta-da! Da-da-da-da-da! Thank you very much everybody!

she's not Mike's Mike's off here I've had the play there you go and hopefully

01:52.020 --> 01:55.300
she's not contagious because we don't all want to catch bubonic plague highly

01:55.300 --> 02:10.300
But we might all catch Ferret, we shall see on tonight's episode. Also tonight, your calls and such, and more information on DER Strike, and, um, Miklotov's in the house for a little bit, um, to talk about his love for something that isn't a video game.

You might know me as Sky.

04:40.960 --> 04:43.760
Joining me, as always, are my awesome co-hosts in this corner.

04:43.760 --> 04:46.760
Welcome back, the happiest bunny on the farm, Dark Sakura.

04:46.760 --> 04:47.760
Hi.

04:47.760 --> 04:50.520
How are you?

04:50.520 --> 04:51.520
I don't know.

04:51.520 --> 04:58.160
You say you're still coughing right now, that's not picking up on the mic, but you don't sound

04:58.160 --> 04:59.160
sick.

04:59.160 --> 05:03.080
Like the last two weeks, you sounded sick, but now it's kind of one of those, you obviously

05:03.080 --> 05:05.880
have a virus or something, because you don't sound sick.

05:05.880 --> 05:06.880
I don't have a virus.

05:06.880 --> 05:07.880
It's bacterial.

05:07.880 --> 05:10.880
My voice does, on occasion, come and go.

05:10.880 --> 05:12.880
That's why I didn't really talk much today.

05:12.880 --> 05:14.880
Yeah, but you sound pretty solid tonight, so good job.

05:14.880 --> 05:17.880
I apparently have whooping cough now.

05:17.880 --> 05:21.880
Yeah, we're going to play the Wheel of Infection, I think Sloky called it.

05:21.880 --> 05:23.880
Wheel of Infection, turn, turn, turn.

05:23.880 --> 05:25.880
Show us which disease Jamie should have.

05:25.880 --> 05:29.880
The thing is that whooping cough is something you're inoculated against when you're younger.

05:29.880 --> 05:36.880
Only it apparently has something like some 10, 20% chance of hitting you when you're older.

05:36.880 --> 05:43.600
fun huh exciting yay diseases so we'll be talking diseases with jamie tonight also in that corner

05:43.600 --> 05:49.520
we'll be talking hamburgers with loki i'm almost done how how how is your biggest gainer adventure

05:49.520 --> 05:55.040
going it's it's going i haven't had mcdonald's though in a week at least well that's that's

05:55.040 --> 06:01.040
at least an accomplishment i mean i had um turkey this week so all right no time for mcdonald's but

06:01.040 --> 06:05.920
no i actually just i kind of wanted some quick didn't have anything so i got two cheeseburgers

06:05.920 --> 06:08.920
which is a lot better than having like a double quarter pounder, I mean, obviously.

06:08.920 --> 06:14.920
I guess, but you know what would be really good would be like one of those fruit and walnut salads would be a really good choice.

06:14.920 --> 06:15.920
Well there's a problem here, I don't eat-

06:15.920 --> 06:16.920
That's actually worse.

06:16.920 --> 06:17.920
Really?

06:17.920 --> 06:18.920
I don't eat salad.

06:18.920 --> 06:20.920
If you use half the walnuts, don't use walnuts.

06:20.920 --> 06:23.920
The heavy sugar, I mean it's candy walnuts.

06:23.920 --> 06:26.920
Only I only use half the walnuts, cause I know that they're candy walnuts and they're not that great.

06:26.920 --> 06:29.920
And dried fruit is even higher in sugar than, yes it is.

06:29.920 --> 06:30.920
And I don't like nuts.

06:30.920 --> 06:31.920
It concentrates the sugar.

06:31.920 --> 06:39.920
I hate the regulars. I don't like their regular salads. If I'm going to get a regular salad, I want like Fresh Choice, a real salad place. I can't do McDonald's salads. But anyway.

06:39.920 --> 06:43.920
I'm eating one of their salads right now and I find it highly tasty. I don't like it. I can't do it.

06:43.920 --> 06:50.920
I hate salads. I hate the taste of lettuce. I've tried it numerous times. I do not like lettuce. It's awful.

06:50.920 --> 06:52.920
Lettuce is something I used to hate as a child, but I like it now.

06:52.920 --> 06:55.920
I don't care for lettuce. I prefer spinach and it has spinach in it.

06:55.920 --> 06:58.920
Spinach is good. Anyway, we'll talk plenty of food later throughout the show.

06:58.920 --> 07:03.160
throughout the show but also say hello to the one and only mikatov

07:03.160 --> 07:07.240
are you playing mario kart online right now? no i'm trying to unlock rob

07:07.240 --> 07:10.800
well i'm right here

07:10.800 --> 07:11.600
got him funny

07:11.600 --> 07:16.360
he's working on the chassis he built

07:16.360 --> 07:19.620
i somehow highly doubt that

07:19.620 --> 07:22.640
how far are you in unlocking rob you almost there?

07:22.640 --> 07:25.280
uh... i have like two more races and then yeah

07:25.280 --> 07:28.080
i think that will stop interrupting him entities

07:28.080 --> 07:31.240
he's very thin like in playing his mario kart over there so will

07:31.240 --> 07:37.240
we'll take a break mario kart today if you actually doing the show

07:37.240 --> 07:37.980
again

07:37.980 --> 07:39.500
i refuse to play

07:39.500 --> 07:42.040
when we get it i want more information on this when we come back we're gonna

07:42.040 --> 07:43.200
take a quick break though

07:43.200 --> 07:47.120
uh... and i can't wait to tell this week so i'm in a very ten stylish mood

07:47.120 --> 07:49.480
uh... so we're placing music content style

07:49.480 --> 07:51.480
and we'll come back and to our show

07:51.480 --> 07:54.120
sojourner charam dedicated or something to come

07:54.120 --> 07:58.120
we'll be right back after this first started off with uh...

07:58.120 --> 08:01.160
start up with a strong a song called strong woman

08:01.160 --> 08:02.620
was the s songs

08:02.620 --> 08:05.560
hopefully it works out i just got this before the show started so i hope it

08:05.560 --> 08:06.180
works

08:06.180 --> 08:13.180
with that as a moral

09:36.180 --> 10:04.180
I didn't get a chance to cry But I just ain't got no way to go

10:34.180 --> 10:44.180
I'm gone.

10:44.180 --> 10:49.180
I'm gone.

10:49.180 --> 10:52.180
Well, I was just a friend for you.

10:52.180 --> 10:56.180
I won't let you down.

10:56.180 --> 10:59.180
I can't.

10:59.180 --> 11:02.180
Will it be all right?

11:02.180 --> 11:07.180
I'm going down to Redwood, I'm gonna have to yell

11:08.180 --> 11:11.180
I can't hear you, I can't hear you

11:11.180 --> 11:13.180
10-1-1

15:41.180 --> 16:07.820
Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio, we're in the middle of episode number 165,

16:07.820 --> 16:08.820
if you can believe it.

16:08.820 --> 16:10.620
I was just kind of thinking about today, you know,

16:10.620 --> 16:16.320
165 doesn't sound like a big number. Would you consider that that's one a week?

16:16.320 --> 16:18.620
That is an awfully long time. 165 weeks.

16:18.620 --> 16:22.500
And that doesn't even count weeks off and stuff, because we're entitled to a week off once in a while, dammit.

16:22.500 --> 16:23.460
Yes, Loki?

16:23.460 --> 16:26.260
Thought. You have your finger up in thought.

16:26.260 --> 16:27.900
Your mic's not on, but...

16:27.900 --> 16:29.220
Why'd you turn the mic off?

16:29.220 --> 16:31.460
Bad you.

16:31.460 --> 16:35.060
Is 169 going to be on New Year's Eve?

16:35.060 --> 16:38.820
I don't know, but we have to decide and we can worry about this next month if we're going

16:38.820 --> 16:39.820
to do shit.

16:39.820 --> 16:42.020
Because I think, isn't Christmas and New Year's Eve on a Sunday this year?

16:42.020 --> 16:43.020
Yep.

16:43.020 --> 16:44.020
Both are.

16:44.020 --> 16:45.020
See, I don't know if we want to do shows then.

16:45.020 --> 16:48.940
I don't know about you, but I'm not going to be here on Christmas.

16:48.940 --> 16:52.140
Yeah, New Year's Eve, definitely not, because there's other things I've got to do.

16:52.140 --> 16:54.380
So we might be taking some time off for the holidays.

16:54.380 --> 16:55.380
And you know what?

16:55.380 --> 16:56.380
We earned it.

16:56.380 --> 16:57.380
So shut up.

16:57.380 --> 16:58.380
No one's going to be listening.

16:58.380 --> 16:59.380
Anyways, they're going to be out.

16:59.380 --> 17:01.340
We'll do a marathon or something special.

17:01.340 --> 17:04.860
We'll pre-record a little special treat for, yeah, nobody's going to want to listen to

17:04.860 --> 17:09.660
on New Year's Eve. Come on. People are going to go out to parties and stuff. Maybe the

17:09.660 --> 17:13.660
dude that records us every week will record the station to see what was here. Actually,

17:13.660 --> 17:18.700
there's several people that are recording us, but I don't see a big demand for programming

17:18.700 --> 17:24.900
on New Year's Eve. Now, I've got to talk to Jess over at DDR Freak and see if we want

17:24.900 --> 17:29.400
to do something special on New Year's Day again, although I don't know. The last time

17:29.400 --> 17:34.300
I proposed the idea, it was kind of this general meh across the board, so we'll have to see.

17:34.300 --> 17:36.300
I was kind of met with this general, meh.

17:36.300 --> 17:38.300
We'll see.

17:38.300 --> 17:43.300
Are you sure that any of us are going to be in any shape to do any kind of broadcasting on New Year's Day?

17:43.300 --> 17:47.300
Now, last year it went okay. Everybody had a hangover, but it went okay.

17:47.300 --> 17:49.300
Who doesn't get hangovers in this room?

17:49.300 --> 17:51.300
That would be me!

17:51.300 --> 17:53.300
Okay, granted, but you know.

17:53.300 --> 17:54.300
And me?

17:54.300 --> 17:56.300
Oh, whatever. I don't care.

17:56.300 --> 18:00.300
I can't get near alcohol poisoning, but I don't get hangovers. Go, Gray.

18:00.300 --> 18:02.140
greg okay

18:02.140 --> 18:05.380
and that lots of good points in the chassis now the chair lighting up

18:05.380 --> 18:08.820

18:14.180 --> 18:18.340

18:33.360 --> 18:35.080
stories

18:35.080 --> 18:36.920
with the hallmark trimmer

18:36.920 --> 18:40.540
uh... let's see what else they say in general there um... nobody's doing us

18:40.540 --> 18:43.180
for not wanting to do a christmas episode

18:43.180 --> 18:45.220
bitches

18:45.220 --> 18:47.960
well excuse me maybe we'd like to spend time with our families

18:47.960 --> 18:51.200
we want to open up presents that's a very important part of christmas day

18:51.200 --> 18:53.800
i want christmas nookie dammit and i'm not going to be here

18:53.800 --> 18:57.800
Exactly! I want Christmas Nookie, too.

18:57.800 --> 19:00.800
Anyway, how was Thanksgiving? Did you get any Thanksgiving Nookie?

19:00.800 --> 19:03.800
No. I'm still too sick.

19:03.800 --> 19:08.800
I ate my food, and then I got in such a bad headache

19:08.800 --> 19:11.800
while trying to watch Dan play Perfect Dark Zero,

19:11.800 --> 19:15.800
which was a very pretty, very pretty game.

19:15.800 --> 19:17.800
Actually, it wasn't Dan who was giving me the headache,

19:17.800 --> 19:20.800
it was watching his friend who completely sucks at that game

19:20.800 --> 19:26.360
being, like, an absolute retard playing it. So, uh, I, uh, I mean, it was, it was really

19:26.360 --> 19:32.120
making some dumb mistakes. So, uh, I just sort of laid back and, uh, threw a pillow

19:32.120 --> 19:37.120
on Dan's lap and passed out. And I actually did fall asleep for something like two hours.

19:37.120 --> 19:42.120
But you're sick, so you can. I still feel crappy.

19:42.120 --> 19:46.320
I'm starting to get a sore throat. I wonder if you've infected me.

19:46.320 --> 19:50.320
If I have whipping cough, it's highly contagious.

19:50.320 --> 19:55.320
But if you've already been inoculated, you have an 80% chance of not getting it.

19:55.320 --> 19:57.320
Well, we'll see.

19:57.320 --> 20:00.320
I don't know. We're probably all going to be sick next week. It'll be horrible.

20:00.320 --> 20:02.320
I might.

20:02.320 --> 20:06.320
Anyway, as long as we're talking about Thanksgiving, we might as well talk about your week and your day.

20:06.320 --> 20:08.320
So, Dark Sakura, how was your week? How was your day?

20:08.320 --> 20:10.320
How was my month?

20:10.320 --> 20:14.320
How was your month? It's been a little while since I've been here.

20:14.320 --> 20:18.960
It involves lung cookies and homework, and that's about it.

20:18.960 --> 20:21.240
I slept 16 hours yesterday.

20:21.240 --> 20:23.960
I slept 17 hours last Saturday.

20:23.960 --> 20:27.240
I had lung spasms at work Friday and had

20:27.240 --> 20:29.480
to go home the week before.

20:29.480 --> 20:32.680
And yeah, I've been really, really crappy sick

20:32.680 --> 20:34.920
and haven't even felt much like playing anything,

20:34.920 --> 20:37.600
let alone sitting up and going to work.

20:37.600 --> 20:40.720
But I did play.

20:40.720 --> 20:43.520
I opened World of Warcraft and then shut it down.

20:43.520 --> 20:48.420
And then last night around 1 a.m. I played some We Love Katamari

20:48.420 --> 20:51.380
and then started getting really motion sick.

20:51.380 --> 20:55.300
It's like my stomach has gone between being ravenously hungry and being very

20:55.300 --> 20:57.500
nauseated.

20:57.500 --> 21:03.740
So, trying to play We Love Katamari while being highly nauseated anyway just spells disaster.

21:03.740 --> 21:08.300
Spells don't make any plans, because it's all coming up.

21:08.300 --> 21:11.600
That's one way of explaining it, I suppose.

21:11.600 --> 21:13.360
working out your weekend

21:13.360 --> 21:16.460
my week was good because there is turkey involved uh...

21:16.460 --> 21:17.400
and then

21:17.400 --> 21:21.980
it you know is very chaotic we got my car fixed finally

21:21.980 --> 21:23.640
and that was cool so

21:23.640 --> 21:25.040
then i had turkey

21:25.040 --> 21:26.480
that was also good

21:26.480 --> 21:27.780
under the rest of the week

21:27.780 --> 21:30.160
you know last four days is really trying to be productive

21:30.160 --> 21:33.640
but that didn't happen

21:33.640 --> 21:37.220
no instead i'd kind of watered around a black friday trying to see if there's

21:37.220 --> 21:39.520
any three sixties around

21:39.520 --> 21:45.520
Oh, give me a break! I mean, would you really think you were going to find a 360 on Black Friday?

21:45.520 --> 21:48.920
No, I just wanted to get out of the house.

21:48.920 --> 21:52.680
So I went and picked up another game for the 360 I don't have yet.

21:52.680 --> 21:57.520
So I have Cameo now. Luckily there's a used copy. Someone already put out a used copy.

21:57.520 --> 22:01.800
That's interesting. It's probably a review copy or something.

22:01.800 --> 22:03.160
Something like that.

22:03.160 --> 22:07.800
Yeah, not like any of the copies I bring back are. Anyways, then I went to Best Buy

22:07.800 --> 22:14.680
and wandered around there for about a few seconds. They have quite a few Xboxes and

22:14.680 --> 22:21.620
the PS2 Slims. They were blocking off aisles with them. I'm like, okay, I get the point

22:21.620 --> 22:27.280
that you have lots of these systems available. Not the one I'm looking for, but I don't know.

22:27.280 --> 22:31.420
I just kind of fed up with Best Buy. Dude, why were people lined up at 10 o'clock

22:31.420 --> 22:36.880
Thanksgiving evening outside Best Buy, like they were camped out for Black Friday? Can

22:36.880 --> 22:38.880
Can you give a microphone to make it sound?

22:38.880 --> 22:40.880
There were like computers for like $150.

22:40.880 --> 22:42.880
Diesel ones?

22:42.880 --> 22:44.880
I think so. Yeah, and laptops for like $200.

22:44.880 --> 22:47.880
Wow. I don't know. Hell, maybe I should have camped out too.

22:47.880 --> 22:51.880
They had some HP computers or something. I don't know.

22:51.880 --> 22:54.880
I just didn't really want it.

22:54.880 --> 22:58.880
Didn't Walmart do some type of like $400 laptop or something too?

22:58.880 --> 23:01.880
They were talking about it and I don't know if they did or not.

23:01.880 --> 23:03.880
It was a big mess.

23:03.880 --> 23:10.880
But, um, I actually went to GameStop, um, that day, thinking, oh, well, the GameStop by my house is normally not crowded at all.

23:10.880 --> 23:16.880
They have, like, a friggin' line of seven people in there, like, at about noon. It was crazy.

23:16.880 --> 23:29.880
Because I wanted to see, first off, where it was on the Xbox 360, you know, pre-orders, and, um, also, you know, whether or not they had any accessories and stuff, and possibly games.

23:29.880 --> 23:40.880
But now I'm to the point now I have the four games I kind of wanted, and there's really nothing else I want, um, except for maybe DOA 4, but, um, once that comes out, there's nothing I want for at least a few months.

23:40.880 --> 23:49.880
And, actually, looking at my list of games coming out, there's nothing coming out for the 360 until February.

23:49.880 --> 23:53.880
It's like PSP syndrome all over again, or Nintendo DS.

23:53.880 --> 24:05.880
That's crazy though, I mean, even, excluding the delay on Dead or Alive 4, you would actually have two months of nothing for the 360, and I mean, that's pretty bad.

24:05.880 --> 24:07.880
When's that Baldur's Gate coming out? Did that get pushed all the way back to February?

24:07.880 --> 24:09.880
Elder Scrolls is coming out in April or March.

24:09.880 --> 24:10.880
Why did I say Baldur's Gate?

24:10.880 --> 24:16.880
It's Elder Scrolls, I think March now, or March or April, I can't remember.

24:16.880 --> 24:20.880
The only big games coming out in December is nothing.

24:20.880 --> 24:26.880
The only real game worth mentioning is actually just Gauntlet Seven Sorrows.

24:26.880 --> 24:30.880
That's it. That and Dead or Alive, because Dead or Alive got pushed back.

24:30.880 --> 24:34.880
Gauntlet Seven Sorrows is also coming out on the other systems too, so it doesn't really matter.

24:34.880 --> 24:36.880
Well, that's not on the 360, I'm just talking games in general.

24:36.880 --> 24:37.880
Oh, shit.

24:37.880 --> 24:43.880
And then for the month of January, 25 to life, which would be pretty big.

24:43.880 --> 24:56.880
Well, January is a very slow period for games, just as it is for movies, because after the holidays, there's really nothing up again until the early spring period.

24:56.880 --> 25:02.880
Probably there's going to be a very big lull between the holidays and probably summer. There usually is.

25:02.880 --> 25:04.880
Yeah, it should be...

25:04.880 --> 25:08.880
There's a couple of big titles in February and March. I think we're getting Prime Hunters on the DS somewhere in there.

25:08.880 --> 25:12.880
March? Yeah. Well, you get a couple of big titles. That's about it.

25:12.880 --> 25:20.880
I don't know. I'm thinking now I gotta put down my money for a Revolution and a PS3 if I want them.

25:20.880 --> 25:30.880
PS3 I'm not so worried about because they haven't even really announced a date for that yet, and I'm thinking it's not going to be until the fall anyways of next year.

25:30.880 --> 25:32.880
Revolution, though, I'd be wanting to pick up.

25:32.880 --> 25:35.880
I think Revolution and PS3 will both be out by next Christmas, I really do.

25:35.880 --> 25:39.880
I think they're gonna rush them just like Xbox Rush to get out there, but I think they'll be out there by Christmas.

25:39.880 --> 25:41.880
Revolution, they've been taking their time on, so...

25:41.880 --> 25:45.880
Yeah, but I think, you know, the fact that they haven't said a lot about it, I think is a good sign.

25:45.880 --> 25:48.880
I think it's gonna be like a Nintendo 64 launch.

25:50.880 --> 25:52.880
Comet? Sorry.

25:52.880 --> 25:57.880
I'm just seeing the 360 going the way of the Dreamcast.

25:57.880 --> 25:58.880
Interesting.

25:58.880 --> 25:59.880
There's a lot in common.

25:59.880 --> 26:04.980
I saw that story on 1UP.com that shared what they had in common, but that's the same marketing

26:04.980 --> 26:07.540
guys behind them both, isn't it?

26:07.540 --> 26:08.840
I don't get the commercials.

26:08.840 --> 26:09.840
They're stupid.

26:09.840 --> 26:11.840
I haven't even seen an Xbox 360 commercial, but I...

26:11.840 --> 26:15.160
Well, you probably don't even realize it is an Xbox 360 commercial unless you watch it

26:15.160 --> 26:18.560
all the way through, because they don't say or show anything about the Xbox 360.

26:18.560 --> 26:25.080
They show kids playing in really cryptic, artistic crap, and then they go, Xbox 360!

26:25.080 --> 26:29.040
It reminds me of this commercial we made for our economics class.

26:29.040 --> 26:34.640
It was basically a bunch of kick-ass clips of action sequences during movies, like explosions

26:34.640 --> 26:39.360
and people getting beat up and stuff, and at the very end, buy bumper stickers.

26:39.360 --> 26:40.360
And that was it.

26:40.360 --> 26:41.360
That was the whole thing.

26:41.360 --> 26:47.480
And this is kind of like the whole 360 thing is, you know, you show a bunch of kids playing

26:47.480 --> 26:51.960
and having a water balloon fight or something, 360, it's like, you look at it, you're like,

26:51.960 --> 26:52.960
what the hell, I don't get it.

26:52.960 --> 26:57.640
That doesn't say anything about the system, what it does, what it is, it just shows kids

26:57.640 --> 26:58.640
playing.

26:58.640 --> 27:03.640
Okay, so the 360 is a watermelon launcher? I mean, what the hell is it?

27:03.640 --> 27:06.640
It's stupid.

27:06.640 --> 27:08.640
Makes me glad I don't watch TV.

27:08.640 --> 27:13.640
I barely watch TV at all, and even the few shows I do watch, thanks to the lovely DVR we have,

27:13.640 --> 27:17.640
I fast-forward through all the commercials, so I don't have to watch it.

27:17.640 --> 27:20.640
So that's why I'm like, oh, there's a funny commercial? I don't know.

27:20.640 --> 27:23.640
Anyway, anything else you want to share about your week and your day?

27:23.640 --> 27:25.640
No, that's pretty much it.

27:25.640 --> 27:30.720
I went to GameStop on Black Friday as well, but I went to the one near here, and the line

27:30.720 --> 27:34.760
was only about one, two people, like it usually is, nothing extraordinary, although the store

27:34.760 --> 27:38.120
was crowded, but a lot of people that were in the store were just stupid kids, as are

27:38.120 --> 27:42.640
usually in that GameStop, stupid kids, like a bunch of kids just randomly like ran out

27:42.640 --> 27:45.800
of the store and ran out around the corner, and I thought they stole something or something,

27:45.800 --> 27:50.640
but nobody ran after them, so I'm guessing that's a good sign, but yeah, GameStop around

27:50.640 --> 27:53.640
here, just this particular one near me is very strange.

27:53.640 --> 28:00.560
Anyway, I picked up Dragon Quest VIII, because I'd seen that game earlier in the week, and

28:00.560 --> 28:04.640
it looked pretty cool, so I wanted to pick it up and play it.

28:04.640 --> 28:07.120
And also the Final Fantasy XII demo, which is very, very sexy.

28:07.120 --> 28:09.440
I'm going to let you borrow it so you can see it, because it's very sexy.

28:09.440 --> 28:10.440
No need.

28:10.440 --> 28:13.440
Oh, you already got it?

28:13.440 --> 28:14.440
I found...

28:14.440 --> 28:15.440
I found...

28:15.440 --> 28:16.440
You acquired it.

28:16.440 --> 28:17.440
I acquired it.

28:17.440 --> 28:18.440
I see.

28:18.440 --> 28:19.440
You acquired it through your various contacts.

28:19.440 --> 28:21.540
Do you need it, or do you already have it?

28:21.540 --> 28:27.740
only about the final fantasy 12 demo which is pretty cool i have the trailer it's a playable

28:27.740 --> 28:33.340
demo this one oh no i don't you want to borrow it pretty cool okay very cool sounds like

28:33.340 --> 28:39.420
it was like 11 i just got the dragon warrior 9 or whatever one there's a whatever the new

28:39.420 --> 28:44.940
dragon dragon quest yeah about the actual game dragon quest 8 dragon warrior dragon

28:44.940 --> 28:50.220
Well, they re- they went back to their old quest, because Squeenix is doing this whole

28:50.220 --> 28:54.860
mea culpa. Yes, we did change the names of all your games. We released them in the U.S.

28:54.860 --> 29:01.340
for Nintendo through Nintendo. We fixed. I'll talk more about Drag Quest on the podcast,

29:01.340 --> 29:07.260
but yeah, I like that game. And been playing a little bit of Mario Kart here and there,

29:07.260 --> 29:13.740
and World of Warcraft a little bit, a little bit, not a whole lot though, and that's about

29:13.740 --> 29:14.740
it.

29:14.740 --> 29:21.020
I think what else I did in my personal life, as far as, oh, sorry, I'm using the crappy

29:21.020 --> 29:26.340
mic tonight, so if my voice fades in and out just because I'm on the crappy mic tonight.

29:26.340 --> 29:29.780
I didn't really do anything for Thanksgiving, because I have a small family, so it's just

29:29.780 --> 29:33.300
me, my mom, and my dad, so we just went out to eat, because my mom was like, forget it,

29:33.300 --> 29:36.780
I'm not going to spend 100 bucks on cookie turkey, just, you know, for three of us, so

29:36.780 --> 29:40.060
We went out to eat, which was cool, because we went to a fancy shmancy restaurant that

29:40.060 --> 29:44.380
was open on Thanksgiving, so it was nice to be, you know, snobby for a day.

29:44.380 --> 29:49.220
And that was about it for my Thanksgiving, I didn't do a whole lot else, I hung out with,

29:49.220 --> 29:51.860
you know, the guy I'm seeing the rest of the day, that was about it, because he didn't

29:51.860 --> 29:53.740
have a whole lot going on either.

29:53.740 --> 29:57.820
And that's about it.

29:57.820 --> 30:01.140
It's just been very nice to have these past few days off of work, because I'm not going

30:01.140 --> 30:04.780
to have a vacation like this again until like February, because I'm taking some massive

30:04.780 --> 30:10.580
time off in February, and it's just very nice to have a break. So I feel very charged, I'm

30:10.580 --> 30:17.260
very relaxed tonight. I hate this mic. I'm in a pretty decent mood, all things considered.

30:17.260 --> 30:23.700
But yeah. So Miklotov, you're here. I know you're in the middle of a race, but you gotta

30:23.700 --> 30:27.460
pause that for a minute. And of course we have to give the disclaimer that, you know,

30:27.460 --> 30:30.480
even though he works for Konami, don't read into too much of anything that he says, because

30:30.480 --> 30:34.620
he's not here to represent Konami tonight, he's here to represent himself. Yes? As usual.

30:34.620 --> 30:36.620
So, how was your week? How was your day?

30:36.620 --> 30:39.620
My week was pretty boring because all I do is work.

30:39.620 --> 30:44.620
Mario Kart has taken over our office every break, almost every lunch.

30:44.620 --> 30:47.620
We play eight player matches. It's really fun.

30:47.620 --> 30:51.620
I love hearing that at Konami you'll play games by other people all the time.

30:51.620 --> 30:52.620
Of course.

30:52.620 --> 30:55.620
I'm sure all the other companies do it too. It's just kind of neat, you know.

30:55.620 --> 31:02.620
Yeah. We even use our DS's that we're not supposed to use for actual gaming to play because not everybody has a DS there.

31:02.620 --> 31:11.680
there and then I saw rent which is an amazing movie don't say anything it's

31:11.680 --> 31:17.880
your moment I'll let you have your movie movie I saw it twice actually and I

31:17.880 --> 31:25.920
picked up Brokeback Mountain two books of it and the soundtrack and it's

31:25.920 --> 31:29.280
amazing how do you buy two books of Brokeback Mountain um well they

31:29.280 --> 31:31.480
They released a standalone.

31:31.480 --> 31:37.120
It's really just a short story from a collection of cowboy western stories.

31:37.120 --> 31:40.920
So I picked up the book that had all those short stories in it, and then they also released

31:40.920 --> 31:47.080
the one for the movie that's coming out, and I picked that one up also, and the soundtrack.

31:47.080 --> 31:48.720
And I'm in love.

31:48.720 --> 31:49.720
A lot.

31:49.720 --> 31:50.720
Okay.

31:50.720 --> 31:51.720
And the movie comes out when?

31:51.720 --> 31:52.720
December 9th.

31:52.720 --> 31:57.760
I thought it was next week, and then to my horrible, horrible dismay, it's actually two

31:57.760 --> 32:02.640
weeks from now. So now next week's going to be depressing because that's all I was looking

32:02.640 --> 32:08.160
forward to. I'm sorry. It's okay. There'll be other things to make you happy. Nope. Go

32:08.160 --> 32:11.840
see Rent again, it'll make you feel better. No, I'm just going to have to read the book

32:11.840 --> 32:17.280
every day like I planned on doing anyway. So speaking of work, any songs you've been

32:17.280 --> 32:23.840
hearing a lot at work lately? Any songs get stuck in your head? No. Anything that you've

32:23.840 --> 32:27.760
Have you, by chance, maybe been spinning a turntable or making some, uh,

32:27.760 --> 32:29.760
arrows, stomping noises too?

32:29.760 --> 32:31.760
I refuse to, uh, comment.

32:31.760 --> 32:32.760
Go ahead.

32:32.760 --> 32:33.760
Go ahead.

32:33.760 --> 32:34.760
I have to try.

32:34.760 --> 32:36.760
The listeners would get angry and say that, you know, we're far, so I didn't try.

32:36.760 --> 32:37.760
Oh, oh, wait.

32:37.760 --> 32:38.760
The Mario Kart music.

32:38.760 --> 32:43.280
Oh, and, and, and a lot of random 90s music I've been listening to at work lately, but

32:43.280 --> 32:46.400
nothing to do with DDR or anything like that, so don't read into that, just, that's what

32:46.400 --> 32:49.640
I play when I'm doing work.

32:49.640 --> 32:51.600
So I hear rhythm is a dancer a lot.

32:51.600 --> 32:56.000
I've never... I don't know if I can say that. There was something that happened once that

32:56.000 --> 33:00.140
involved work and somebody hearing a song a lot that was really, really funny that happened

33:00.140 --> 33:01.140
once.

33:01.140 --> 33:02.140
Dave & Busters?

33:02.140 --> 33:06.680
Yeah. Can I say that on the air? I don't know. It's in the past, so I can say that now, right?

33:06.680 --> 33:11.620
I won't say who it was. I'll just say somebody. It wasn't me. Somebody who also is very close

33:11.620 --> 33:12.880
with Konami said...

33:12.880 --> 33:13.880
Used to be.

33:13.880 --> 33:19.540
Yeah. Well, whatever. It was this song that was playing on the Dave & Busters radio station

33:19.540 --> 33:28.780
And she said, or he or she said, she said, he or she said, he or she said that, um, fuck,

33:28.780 --> 33:35.620
I don't know if I can continue the story now, I don't know if I can continue the story now

33:35.620 --> 33:37.380
because I don't want to get anybody in trouble.

33:37.380 --> 33:38.380
They don't work there anymore.

33:38.380 --> 33:39.380
Alright, it's fine.

33:39.380 --> 33:44.580
The person said that, oh man, I can't get this song out of my head because I've been

33:44.580 --> 33:48.260
hearing it at work so much lately, and I'm like, oh really?

33:48.260 --> 33:53.180
Turns out it was an Ultramix 2 license that nobody knew about yet at the time, so it was

33:53.180 --> 33:54.180
really funny.

33:54.180 --> 33:55.180
I don't know.

33:55.180 --> 33:56.180
Anyway, that's in the past.

33:56.180 --> 33:58.100
Oh, and the rest of my week was watching that Next clip constantly.

33:58.100 --> 34:00.100
Yo, what's that about?

34:00.100 --> 34:01.580
Tell them about the show that we watched.

34:01.580 --> 34:05.300
Hey, there's this show called The Soup on E!

34:05.300 --> 34:06.300
And they show...

34:06.300 --> 34:07.620
Yeah, it's great.

34:07.620 --> 34:12.540
They show clips of random TV shows, reality shows, other types of shows, and they have

34:12.540 --> 34:18.960
This clip of the MTV show called Next, and this stupid little Asian chick was getting

34:18.960 --> 34:23.860
off the Next bus, because the whole premise of Next is you have these five people you're

34:23.860 --> 34:27.700
going to date for 20 minutes, pretty much, and you tell them next to get the next one

34:27.700 --> 34:29.200
to come out.

34:29.200 --> 34:34.720
She's walking out of the van thing, and she's doing her little spiel for the camera.

34:34.720 --> 34:37.680
As she's saying that, she falls down the steps.

34:37.680 --> 34:43.600
It's really funny because they freeze frame on her falling down and she has the best expression

34:43.600 --> 34:45.440
on her face.

34:45.440 --> 34:48.440
It's somewhere between laughing and just shock.

34:48.440 --> 34:49.440
It's really great.

34:49.440 --> 34:53.760
And she was a stupid whore anyway.

34:53.760 --> 34:57.840
I love how he's like, I just wanted you to walk over here because I wasn't sure if you

34:57.840 --> 35:00.920
were okay or not, next!

35:00.920 --> 35:04.520
That was nice.

35:04.520 --> 35:05.520
Let's see.

35:05.520 --> 35:09.280
Oh, I know what I wanted to ask you about as well.

35:09.280 --> 35:14.600
One little work-related thing that I'm okay to say, I think, is that you met L.E.D.

35:14.600 --> 35:15.600
Yeah.

35:15.600 --> 35:16.600
You met L.E.D.

35:16.600 --> 35:17.600
How was that?

35:17.600 --> 35:18.600
I got to have dinner with L.E.D.

35:18.600 --> 35:19.600
Really?

35:19.600 --> 35:20.600
Ooh, yeah.

35:20.600 --> 35:21.600
Was it a nice dinner?

35:21.600 --> 35:22.600
Like, did you guys go to a fancy restaurant?

35:22.600 --> 35:23.600
We went to TGI Fridays, because he wanted American.

35:23.600 --> 35:24.600
Well, that's good stuff.

35:24.600 --> 35:25.600
Yeah, it was pretty good.

35:25.600 --> 35:28.760
Oh, and you probably can't say much about the details of what you guys talked about,

35:28.760 --> 35:33.960
but anything interesting that you might be able to share, like, in, you know, is he...

35:33.960 --> 35:41.640
Maybe, feel free to pass on this question if you have to, but does he seem to be aware

35:41.640 --> 35:44.640
that he has quite a following here in the US?

35:44.640 --> 35:53.240
I don't think that was brought up, but I think he would have to be stupid to know that.

35:53.240 --> 35:58.480
I don't know what I can really say from the dinner, but there was one funny thing.

35:58.480 --> 36:03.400
He asked us, it was me and a couple of other people from work, and he asked us what types

36:03.400 --> 36:08.400
of music we listened to, and I was saying, at the time it was like I was listening to

36:08.400 --> 36:15.740
drum and bass a lot, and I also said Eurobeat, and he kind of groaned, and said Eurobeat

36:15.740 --> 36:18.600
after me, like, he was rather disgusted with that answer.

36:18.600 --> 36:20.600
Aw, you make LED cry.

36:20.600 --> 36:21.600
I thought it was funny.

36:21.600 --> 36:22.600
You make LED cry.

36:22.600 --> 36:23.600
I do.

36:23.600 --> 36:24.600
That's great.

36:24.600 --> 36:25.600
Yeah, it was funny.

36:25.600 --> 36:26.600
That's cool.

36:26.600 --> 36:27.600
Mm-hmm.

36:27.600 --> 36:28.600
Good job.

36:28.600 --> 36:31.880
All right, moving on, if you have nothing else to say for now.

36:31.880 --> 36:32.880
Nope.

36:32.880 --> 36:34.880
Brokeback Mountain's awesome.

37:02.880 --> 37:08.120
something. You know what I think is interesting is that finally after this website's been

37:08.120 --> 37:11.400
running for about three and a half years now, people are considering us like a legitimate

37:11.400 --> 37:15.220
news source. So just for the record, where do you, remind our audience where you get

37:15.220 --> 37:20.920
your information and why it's pretty reliable. My information comes directly from our buyer

37:20.920 --> 37:26.240
because our buyer talks to Konami directly. I mean, these are, they give us the dates

37:26.240 --> 37:30.580
so we know when product's coming out, so we know when we can sell it, when orders are

37:30.580 --> 37:35.260
do, etc. So we have to know what the upcoming slate of titles is gonna be, and that's how

37:35.260 --> 37:41.460
I know what movie titles and game titles, because I work at a freaking distributor,

37:41.460 --> 37:47.700
so you have to know what's coming out when, so that's the tentative date. But, you know,

37:47.700 --> 37:54.420
like, most games, dates shift around, like, weekly. So, you know, what might be March

37:54.420 --> 38:03.260
today, could be January, could be March, or April, who knows? Like, for example, Tomb Raider,

38:03.260 --> 38:07.980
the new one, Tomb Raider Legends, or whatever it was. The Tomb Raider, I don't care anymore.

38:07.980 --> 38:12.860
Yeah, Tomb Raider, trying to reinvent herself, Tomb Raider. Anyway, that game was originally

38:12.860 --> 38:17.700
slated for January. Moved to April, moved back to January, moved back to April, moved

38:17.700 --> 38:21.700
back to January, and now it's in April. It's like they can't figure out when they want

38:21.700 --> 38:26.520
to release a stupid game. But as a perfect example, usually Konami though, they don't

38:26.520 --> 38:30.880
shift their dates around that much. It's usually a couple, and then once it gets closer to

38:30.880 --> 38:35.200
it, it's set in stone. EA, on the other hand, they like shifting their dates all over the

38:35.200 --> 38:36.200
damn place.

38:36.200 --> 38:37.200
Q. How about Square?

38:37.200 --> 38:43.440
A. Square? Not so much. But not many Square games come out. I mean, we've had two in the

38:43.440 --> 38:44.440
last four months.

38:44.440 --> 38:47.720
Q. Well, a question from the chat room. Advent Children, what's the status on that? You know

38:47.720 --> 38:49.040
when that's slated to come out now?

38:49.040 --> 38:50.300
A. That's 2B now still.

38:50.300 --> 38:51.300
Q. Really?

38:51.300 --> 39:00.420
It was going to be in February, then it was actually slated for the end of January, and

39:00.420 --> 39:06.460
then now we have it as moratorium in our system, meaning that we don't have a date yet when

39:06.460 --> 39:07.460
it's coming out.

39:07.460 --> 39:08.460
Why are they doing that?

39:08.460 --> 39:11.340
That's so crazy, because people are pirating this movie like, maybe that's why they're

39:11.340 --> 39:14.140
doing it, because of the piracy they're going to have to go back and add all these extras

39:14.140 --> 39:15.540
that people are going to want to buy the DVD for.

39:15.540 --> 39:19.180
I'm thinking they're probably trying to, because people have bitched and moaned about the fact

39:19.180 --> 39:25.180
Did they all have good box sets over here or anything like that? I didn't talk to the Sony guy. I always yell at him every time he comes in.

39:25.180 --> 39:36.180
He used to have our Sony reps sit about four cubes down from me. So whenever the Sony people would come from Sony Pictures or whatever, I'd yell at them for not releasing Advent Children.

39:36.180 --> 39:47.180
And, you know, I knew more about it than they did. And, you know, I was like, why aren't you releasing the box sets here? And they're like, oh, I don't know.

39:47.180 --> 39:51.180
I'm sure that one guy who comes to your company makes all the calls on what they're going to be releasing.

39:51.180 --> 39:58.180
Well, a lot of the people that come to our company are senior sales or whatever, so they do have somewhat of a say.

39:58.180 --> 40:03.180
But, you know, they... I don't know. I don't know when it's coming out.

40:03.180 --> 40:08.180
All I know is I've seen it. It's cool. Hopefully, it'll be coming out.

40:08.180 --> 40:14.180
But, I don't know. I always keep the website updated. I post when it changes.

40:14.180 --> 40:19.220
Another comment from our chatroom, from Ron Chan, chatroom by the way, orange-on-a-show-you.com,

40:19.220 --> 40:24.500
click on chat, rumors are leaking out about theatrical release. That's kind of true, this

40:24.500 --> 40:28.260
has been something that's kind of been circulating for a while now. We mentioned this on a podcast

40:28.260 --> 40:31.600
like months ago, because I don't even remember why I picked up this bug. Now, I want to say

40:31.600 --> 40:36.980
it was sometime around E3, I picked up a bug, no, it was later than E3. I remember, it was

40:36.980 --> 40:41.220
a friend of a friend kind of thing, so take it with a grain of salt, but it was going

40:41.220 --> 40:46.240
to be released in IMAX, that they really want to do an IMAX release for the movie, which

40:46.240 --> 40:50.800
would kick ass. Don't get me wrong, it would be great. And probably Final Fantasy Advent

40:50.800 --> 40:54.400
Children and IMAX would do better business than the last movie did here is all. Okay,

40:54.400 --> 40:55.400
maybe not.

40:55.400 --> 40:59.980
Yeah, they have Polar Express running right now in IMAX, but I think it needs to be in

40:59.980 --> 41:03.980
IMAX. I mean, that would be awesome if it was in IMAX. Who knows? And if that's the

41:03.980 --> 41:10.100
case, it's going to take a long time to print digital to the IMAX film store.

41:10.100 --> 41:15.100
Since the movie's all digital as it is, it won't take that long to enhance, so to speak, for the movie.

41:15.100 --> 41:16.100
Not really.

41:20.100 --> 41:21.100
Let's go to break.

41:21.100 --> 41:25.100
When we come back from this break, we're going to open up the Skypline, for sure we'll do that.

41:25.100 --> 41:27.100
And also I want to talk a little more about Xbox 360.

41:27.100 --> 41:30.100
This is kind of the launch week for 360.

41:30.100 --> 41:32.100
And I want to talk about 10 style at some point.

41:32.100 --> 41:35.100
And I want to talk about other news going on in the Bomani world, because we have a little bit.

41:35.100 --> 41:37.100
So we will be back after this.

41:37.100 --> 41:40.100
Just some Bimani potpourri this break, no real theme.

41:40.100 --> 41:47.100
And we'll be back with more Orange Lounge Radio after this.

42:10.100 --> 42:14.100
Showing me the way I've forgotten

42:14.100 --> 42:17.100
I've gone too far in confusion

42:17.100 --> 42:21.100
I've been lost

42:21.100 --> 42:24.100
It may take some time

42:24.100 --> 42:27.100
But somehow I only get

42:27.100 --> 42:31.100
To my destination

42:31.100 --> 42:34.100
Now I'm leaving it all behind

42:34.100 --> 42:38.100
I don't know what it is I expect to find

42:38.100 --> 42:42.100
But I'll always want you here by my side

42:44.100 --> 42:47.100
Now I'm leaving you so behind

42:47.100 --> 42:50.100
I don't know what it is I expect

42:50.100 --> 42:55.100
To find but I'll always want you here by my side

42:56.100 --> 42:58.100
Ciao with me

42:59.100 --> 43:01.100
Ciao with me

43:01.100 --> 43:11.100
You come with me now You come with me now

43:31.100 --> 43:35.100
Yeah, yeah, yeah

43:35.100 --> 43:39.100
Yeah, yeah, yeah

43:39.100 --> 43:43.100
Yeah, yeah, yeah

43:53.100 --> 43:55.100
We're headed for pre-med

43:55.100 --> 43:59.100
Until we stand tall

43:59.100 --> 44:04.100
Maybe they see them, and welcome us all

44:05.100 --> 44:10.100
So many like you to go, and things to be found

44:11.100 --> 44:14.100
I'm still not alone, it turns out

44:15.100 --> 44:17.100
Final Countdown

44:21.100 --> 44:23.100
Final Countdown

44:23.100 --> 44:30.100
I don't count down

44:30.100 --> 44:35.100
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

45:30.100 --> 45:30.600
So

45:54.600 --> 45:56.600
Postcards live forever

45:56.740 --> 45:58.360
The crane glass blows and

45:58.360 --> 45:58.800
the wind

45:58.800 --> 46:07.800
It would be a much better fight with you, with me

46:07.800 --> 46:13.800
If you hadn't met me, I'd be fine on my own baby

46:13.800 --> 46:19.800
Never felt so lonely then you came along

46:19.800 --> 46:22.800
So now what should I do?

46:22.800 --> 46:26.800
I'm strung out, addicted to you

46:26.800 --> 46:30.300
My body aches now that you've gone

46:30.300 --> 46:34.800
My supplies fell through

46:34.800 --> 46:39.800
You glad you gave me everything you had and more

46:39.800 --> 46:42.300
You craved my happiness

46:42.300 --> 46:45.800
When you made me feel torn in each smile

46:45.800 --> 46:48.800
But now I feel your stress

46:48.800 --> 46:53.800
Love was never meant to be such a crazy affair, no

46:53.800 --> 47:01.800
And who was I? But you never thought I'd sit around and crumble your love

47:31.800 --> 47:35.800
The

47:35.800 --> 47:39.800
the

47:39.800 --> 47:43.800
the

47:43.800 --> 47:47.800
the

47:47.800 --> 47:51.800
the

47:51.800 --> 47:55.800
the

47:55.800 --> 47:59.800
the

48:29.800 --> 48:39.800
Orange Lounge Radio, Bahmani Music, and more.

48:39.800 --> 48:40.800
Perfect!

48:40.800 --> 48:45.560
We're back here on Orange Lounge Radio and that break you heard, uh, Come With Me from

48:45.560 --> 48:49.960
UltraMix 3, Final Countdown from 2DX4 Style, You're Not Here from Silent Hill, and then

48:49.960 --> 48:54.600
it was in, uh, DDR Extreme as well, and from Keyboard Mania 2nd Mix, Akumajo Dracula Medley,

48:54.600 --> 48:57.400
which is also now in DDR UltraMix 3 as well.

48:57.400 --> 49:00.160
By the way, speaking of Castlevania songs and Bahmani, I don't know if you saw that

49:00.160 --> 49:04.440
early song list for Beatmania Distorted, is what they're calling it.

49:04.440 --> 49:06.420
I still want to call it 13th style.

49:06.420 --> 49:10.580
I know that's a taboo thing to do, is that no, it's not 13th style, it's Distorted.

49:10.580 --> 49:15.780
But it does have 13 in the title this time, so I'm going to call it 13th style, until

49:15.780 --> 49:16.780
I get yelled at.

49:16.780 --> 49:20.500
But no, it's supposed to have Bloody Tears in it, like a remix of Bloody Tears.

49:20.500 --> 49:27.020
That is going to be badass, because Bloody Tears was that song from Castlevania II, and

49:27.020 --> 49:31.900
I can't even, I think part of it is in there, in that song, so it's going to be very awesome.

49:31.900 --> 49:32.900
I can't wait for this.

49:32.900 --> 49:34.540
What is this that you just pulled up there?

49:34.540 --> 49:35.540
Ooh!

49:35.540 --> 49:36.660
Ragnarok Online 2?

49:36.660 --> 49:38.260
That's Ragnarok Online 2 preview?

49:38.260 --> 49:40.660
Will you post that in our chat room so our folks can go?

49:40.660 --> 49:41.660
That looks pretty fun.

49:41.660 --> 49:45.940
Yeah, one of our podcast listeners, Daskay, wrote it to me.

49:45.940 --> 49:46.940
Very cool.

49:46.940 --> 49:47.940
We're going to have a really fun podcast as well.

49:47.940 --> 49:48.940
We're going to post that in the chat room.

49:48.940 --> 49:49.940
Ooh, that looks pretty.

49:49.940 --> 49:50.940
Yeah.

49:50.940 --> 49:54.700
This means that James is going to be quitting World of Warcraft awfully soon.

49:54.700 --> 49:56.700
It's very fluid.

49:56.700 --> 50:02.700
It's got a 3D fluid sense to it, where you're not, you know, warping into fights or anything.

50:02.700 --> 50:05.700
Kind of reminds me of the Final Fantasy XII demo, I must say, actually.

50:05.700 --> 50:10.700
A little bit, a little bit, except you're by yourself, but of course that would be to be expected in an MMO.

50:10.700 --> 50:12.700
That's Ragnarok 2. Interesting.

50:12.700 --> 50:15.700
And there's your customizing for your character outfits.

50:15.700 --> 50:19.700
Our chat room is yelling now for a link, so you better link them up.

50:19.700 --> 50:21.700
Throw in the whole door, sis!

50:21.700 --> 50:26.700
Alright, uh, Loki, you had some interesting observations on eBay?

50:26.700 --> 50:34.700
Well, yeah, I was just looking at the, uh, cause there was, uh, checking on there was this BeatMania, uh, final machine that was on sale for $99, um, before.

50:34.700 --> 50:42.700
But, I looked at the guy that was selling, he's selling some other Bemani stuff, um, Keyboard Mania, uh, third, uh, $280.

50:42.700 --> 50:46.700
Holy fuck, I want that. Oh my god, I don't know where I would put that in this little apartment.

50:46.700 --> 50:49.700
City of Industry is where it's at if you want to pick it up.

50:49.700 --> 50:50.700
Does that mean it's AI selling it? Cause AI's in there.

50:50.700 --> 50:56.700
I don't think it's AI, but they're selling Dance Maniac's second mix.

50:56.700 --> 50:58.700
Hold on, what, Jamie? What?

50:58.700 --> 51:02.700
It had no buy it now on it, and it had many days left on the bed when I looked at it.

51:02.700 --> 51:04.700
Mm.

51:04.700 --> 51:06.700
Okay.

51:06.700 --> 51:08.700
I'm sorry, go ahead, Lucky.

51:08.700 --> 51:14.700
They have a 2DX Red machine for $5,100.

51:14.700 --> 51:19.700
BeatMania, the final right now is only $152.50, but they have a bunch of stuff.

51:19.700 --> 51:27.700
Initial D3, they have a Wang Dan Midnight Maximum Tune 2 racing machine for only $2,500.

51:27.700 --> 51:39.700
Just a bunch of kick-ass stuff. DrumMania 5th, GuitarFreaks 5th, Dance Maniac 2nd, Extreme, and Boxing Mania.

51:39.700 --> 51:44.700
Wow, that's pretty cool. I wonder if that's AI unloading all that stuff, because you know Arcade and Fitbit.

51:44.700 --> 51:47.700
And they're in City of Industry, or at least they're right next to it.

51:47.700 --> 51:49.700
Yeah, they all have a fifth mix, so...

51:49.700 --> 51:51.700
They did, though. They did at one point.

51:51.700 --> 51:53.700
Well, it's probably upgraded, though.

51:53.700 --> 51:59.700
I kinda want that keyboard mania machine. I don't know why I'm so into keyboard mania, but I am.

51:59.700 --> 52:01.700
I really want it.

52:01.700 --> 52:03.700
If I had a house, I'd be getting something.

52:03.700 --> 52:05.700
I don't even have a house and I want it.

52:05.700 --> 52:07.700
The neighbors would kill- you know we have new neighbors now.

52:07.700 --> 52:09.700
We just, uh, got some books moving in finally.

52:09.700 --> 52:12.700
Just think of one thing, Rob. How the fuck are you gonna get that upstairs?

52:12.700 --> 52:15.700
I don't care. I'll get- I'll get five guys over here to lift it.

52:15.700 --> 52:17.700
We'll find a way.

52:17.700 --> 52:19.700
We'll get a dolly.

52:19.700 --> 52:22.700
I'd say rip that shit apart, but yeah.

52:22.700 --> 52:25.700
No, I'm not really gonna buy it. I can't. I can't afford it.

52:25.700 --> 52:27.700
Maybe next year. We'll see.

52:27.700 --> 52:28.700
There's always stuff for sale.

52:28.700 --> 52:31.700
Speaking of next year, it looks highly, highly probable I'm going to be at, uh-

52:31.700 --> 52:36.260
Now, I haven't signed on the line and everything, but it was very, very probable, and I know

52:36.260 --> 52:41.140
we have a lot of listeners on the East Coast who have asked me to hang out with them, and

52:41.140 --> 52:42.140
I actually did.

52:42.140 --> 52:45.980
When I went to Pennsylvania last time I was out there, I actually hung out with a couple

52:45.980 --> 52:46.980
of listeners.

52:46.980 --> 52:47.980
It was cool.

52:47.980 --> 52:48.980
It was a good time.

52:48.980 --> 52:51.900
So I'm down for that again, and the time and place to be at is Katsucon, which is going

52:51.900 --> 52:52.900
to be in February.

52:52.900 --> 52:55.280
I believe it's the 17th through 19th.

52:55.280 --> 52:59.780
Don't quote me on that, but it's around there in D.C., and it's looking very, very likely

52:59.780 --> 53:03.300
I'm going to be there and possibly doing a panel, which will be a lot of fun.

53:03.300 --> 53:06.540
That would be fun. So I will let you know absolutely for sure

53:06.540 --> 53:10.820
the details as soon as I know, and I've bought my plane tickets and everything, but it does

53:10.820 --> 53:13.640
look very likely I'm going to be there. So I'm pretty excited.

53:13.640 --> 53:16.820
I haven't been to D.C. in a long time. The only thing I'm kind of freaked out about

53:16.820 --> 53:20.900
is that in February it might be snowing, right? Don't they get snow?

53:20.900 --> 53:24.900
Yeah. This is the California side of me. Even though

53:24.900 --> 53:27.740
it does snow in some parts of California, I don't live in one of those parts, so I'm

53:27.740 --> 53:30.740
I'm so ignorant when it comes to snow.

53:30.740 --> 53:32.740
I don't know. I've never been to DC.

53:32.740 --> 53:35.740
I have before. It's fun.

53:35.740 --> 53:38.740
Alright.

53:38.740 --> 53:40.740
Uh, anyway.

53:40.740 --> 53:45.740
Uh, moving on. We were going to do Extraverse movie review, but the room cleared out.

53:45.740 --> 53:48.740
Did somebody fart or something? Because the room just cleared out.

53:48.740 --> 53:49.740
His phone rang.

53:49.740 --> 53:51.740
Megalotov ran out. Extraverse phone rang.

53:51.740 --> 53:53.740
Megalotov's trying to pack his bags because they're leaving soon.

53:53.740 --> 54:05.660
I had to go to the restroom. So, gosh. Anyway. Let's see, what else, what else, what else?

54:05.660 --> 54:10.740
I guess let's talk about the 360 for a little bit. Some of the horror stories, did you hear

54:10.740 --> 54:16.140
about some of the horror stories when it came to the 360? About like the Walmart that had

54:16.140 --> 54:20.020
the riot somewhere in Pennsylvania, and there was an EB Games that got robbed.

54:20.020 --> 54:28.020
I heard there were some funny ones. There was one where there was a big line out in front of this Wal-Mart, I think it was, or Wal-Mart or Target, something like that.

54:29.020 --> 54:41.020
So a big line of people, and they had one cop sitting there making sure nothing was going wrong. Then this National Guardsman comes up, and it's like, holy shit, he's getting everything in order.

54:41.020 --> 54:46.520
You know, immediately stands in the front of the line, gets a ticket to buy an Xbox 360, and is like,

54:46.520 --> 54:49.020
FEND FOR YOURSELVES! And leaves.

54:50.020 --> 54:52.520
What? That's crazy.

54:53.020 --> 54:56.520
That's funny, is what that is. I'd be pissed.

54:56.520 --> 55:00.520
I want to let Extrovert do his thing. We'll go back to the 360 in a little bit, but Extrovert's back in the room.

55:00.520 --> 55:03.020
Do you have an important phone call you had to take?

55:03.020 --> 55:05.020
I did have an important very important call.

55:05.020 --> 55:06.020
Was it a hookup call?

55:06.020 --> 55:08.020
It was definitely not a hookup call.

55:08.020 --> 55:08.520
Booty call?

55:08.520 --> 55:09.020
No.

55:09.020 --> 55:10.020
No.

55:10.020 --> 55:11.020
Okay.

55:11.020 --> 55:12.020
Was the family call?

55:12.020 --> 55:13.020
Is everything okay?

55:13.020 --> 55:14.020
No.

55:14.020 --> 55:15.020
Everything's fine.

55:15.020 --> 55:16.020
You seem kind of bummed out tonight.

55:16.020 --> 55:17.020
I know.

55:17.020 --> 55:18.020
Is everything okay?

55:18.020 --> 55:19.020
I'm just like tired.

55:19.020 --> 55:20.020
Do you need a hug?

55:20.020 --> 55:21.020
No.

55:21.020 --> 55:22.020
Don't touch me.

55:22.020 --> 55:23.020
Alright.

55:23.020 --> 55:24.020
I won't.

55:24.020 --> 55:25.020
I'm kidding.

55:25.020 --> 55:26.020
How was your week?

55:26.020 --> 55:27.020
How was your week, Extrover?

55:27.020 --> 55:28.020
My week was fine.

55:28.020 --> 55:30.220
It was like Thanksgiving and stuff.

55:30.220 --> 55:37.460
Saw my family and went and saw Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire again.

55:37.460 --> 55:41.000
did a lot better than the first time that I saw it.

55:41.000 --> 55:42.520
I need to go see that again.

55:42.520 --> 55:43.520
Yay.

55:43.520 --> 55:45.560
Are you going to see that four times in the theater like better?

55:45.560 --> 55:46.560
I can.

55:46.560 --> 55:52.060
Oh, and it's the fourth movie, so you'll see it four times in the theater.

55:52.060 --> 55:53.060
Get it?

55:53.060 --> 55:54.060
Get it?

55:54.060 --> 55:55.060
That's really retarded.

55:55.060 --> 55:56.060
Don't say that again.

55:56.060 --> 55:57.060
All right.

55:57.060 --> 56:00.220
Well, I know you got to get going soon because you and Mickey have to get on the road, but

56:00.220 --> 56:02.400
I wanted to allow you a chance to do your movie review.

56:02.400 --> 56:05.560
Now, I know you hate your old theme music, so I changed your theme music.

56:05.560 --> 56:06.560
Okay?

56:06.560 --> 56:10.560
So, what movie are you going to be reviewing today?

56:10.560 --> 56:12.560
I am going to be...

56:12.560 --> 56:13.560
What is that?

56:13.560 --> 56:14.560
Just do your talking.

56:14.560 --> 56:16.560
Don't worry about what's going on behind you.

56:16.560 --> 56:22.560
I'm going to be reviewing Rent because I went and saw it yesterday with all you folks.

56:22.560 --> 56:34.560
And basically it's a movie about late 80s people trying to make it in New York

56:34.560 --> 56:38.560
And I'm having problems financially and dying of AIDS.

56:39.560 --> 56:44.560
Pretty much like you said yesterday, if you don't get a job, then you'll die of AIDS.

56:44.560 --> 56:48.560
That was my summary of the moral I learned from Rance, is that if you don't get a job, you'll die of AIDS.

56:48.560 --> 56:50.560
Right. Rob didn't really like it that much.

56:50.560 --> 56:52.560
I hated Rance. I hated it a lot.

56:52.560 --> 56:55.560
I liked it. I liked it quite a bit.

56:55.560 --> 57:00.560
And I think that it's maybe because I really just am into musicals. I love them.

57:00.560 --> 57:07.560
I liked the music in them. It was poignant. It had some really good moments in it.

57:07.560 --> 57:10.560
Is that because you're gay? No way. I'm gay and I didn't like it.

57:10.560 --> 57:15.560
No. I don't think that liking musicals is a gay or straight thing.

57:15.560 --> 57:20.560
You can be a musical lover.

57:20.560 --> 57:22.560
That's right. My mom's straight and she loves musicals.

57:22.560 --> 57:25.560
Right. Bad example, Rob.

57:25.560 --> 57:28.560
I like musicals.

57:28.560 --> 57:29.560
They're very fun.

57:29.560 --> 57:31.560
I like musicals, I just don't like rent.

57:31.560 --> 57:33.560
I know, as I heard.

57:33.560 --> 57:35.560
Many a time.

57:35.560 --> 57:39.560
No, it was good though. I liked it, I really enjoyed it.

57:39.560 --> 57:42.560
And there you go.

57:42.560 --> 57:44.560
So two thumbs up?

57:44.560 --> 57:47.560
Two cocks up and a limp cock.

57:47.560 --> 57:50.560
Use protection, or you might catch something.

57:50.560 --> 57:52.560
Oh, right.

57:52.560 --> 57:54.560
Or else your cocks will die of AIDS.

57:54.560 --> 57:55.560
Alright.

57:55.560 --> 57:57.560
And make sure your cocks get a job.

57:57.560 --> 58:01.560
Please get a job. A low job. Okay, I'm off.

58:01.560 --> 58:05.560
Be careful not to sell out to the man. Yeah, don't do that.

58:05.560 --> 58:09.560
Don't sell out to the man. Final thoughts?

58:09.560 --> 58:13.560
Go see Rent. No, don't. You may like it, or you may not.

58:13.560 --> 58:17.560
Alright. Get, get, uh,

58:17.560 --> 58:21.560
X-er, X-er, get, uh, Miklota back in here so that he can say his goodbyes, too,

58:21.560 --> 58:25.560
because I know you guys are leaving soon. Oh, Miklota!

58:25.560 --> 58:31.620
there? Somewhere? Live radio, kids. We're not in an actual studio, by the way. This

58:31.620 --> 58:37.720
is the spare bedroom in the apartment that Extrovert and I live in. It's quite a nifty

58:37.720 --> 58:44.340
apartment. Alright, give that mic back to Loki. Alright. Back to the 360. Yeah. What's

58:44.340 --> 58:48.880
the status on your 360 now? You pre-ordered your 360 back in, remind me when this was,

58:48.880 --> 58:54.640
like June? August. August. And still no dice. No dice. I'm on the first page halfway down,

58:54.640 --> 59:01.040
about. They said, though, that I will probably get mine before Christmas. And I'm guessing

59:01.040 --> 59:05.760
they're saying, someone said in the chatroom that 14 units are going to each store each

59:05.760 --> 59:09.080
week or whatever, so if that's the case, I'll probably get mine probably in two weeks.

59:09.080 --> 59:14.960
Or why would 14 go to the Ma and Pa shop and bump-fuck, you know, North Dakota, but then

59:14.960 --> 59:17.720
14 go to Best Buy? I think they're talking about like, TV games and stuff. Okay, well

59:17.720 --> 59:22.880
that's... I don't think, no one knows until they get the stupid shipments in, so... Do

59:22.880 --> 59:25.880
Do we know anything about future shipments of Xbox 360s? Because that's why I think it's interesting.

59:25.880 --> 59:30.880
It is official that they will be shipping every week to replenish retailers.

59:30.880 --> 59:40.880
So all those fucking people out there that are worried and bidding on stupid auctions that are going for 3,000 plus dollars for these stupid 360s

59:40.880 --> 59:43.880
do not need to be doing that because they're going to be in stores.

59:43.880 --> 59:47.880
There is no shortage, as I've been saying from the get-go, big deal.

59:47.880 --> 59:55.880
They sold out so that their drive-up hype, they did that. Why would you drive up hype if you're not going to replenish the market? So it only makes sense.

59:55.880 --> 01:00:04.880
You know, I have an interesting story to share real quick. I know you got to get going soon, so I want to give you a chance to say your final thought and any other things you want to say to the listeners.

01:00:04.880 --> 01:00:06.880
Brokeback Mountain is the best thing ever.

01:00:06.880 --> 01:00:07.880
Bearback Mountain?

01:00:07.880 --> 01:00:10.880
Yeah, Bearback Mountain. It totally is if you read the book.

01:00:10.880 --> 01:00:14.880
The book's only like 49 pages, so you can totally read it.

01:00:14.880 --> 01:00:19.780
It's only like $10, go buy the soundtrack, go see the movie if you can.

01:00:19.780 --> 01:00:29.580
If you like the notion of people butt-fucking and spitting on their cocks and having that

01:00:29.580 --> 01:00:34.760
as a lubricant, then go see Bareback Mountain.

01:00:34.760 --> 01:00:38.580
You know this is like an Oscar caliber film they're trying to put this out as, and you're

01:00:38.580 --> 01:00:42.860
turning it into a porno.

01:00:42.860 --> 01:00:46.860
Not to be confused with the one we watched last night, The Hornet Store.

01:00:46.860 --> 01:00:48.860
Anyway, look, let's just move on.

01:00:48.860 --> 01:00:49.860
Let's just move on.

01:00:49.860 --> 01:00:50.860
All right.

01:00:50.860 --> 01:00:51.860
Thank you guys for coming.

01:00:51.860 --> 01:00:52.860
Have a lovely...

01:00:52.860 --> 01:00:53.860
Have a safe drive back.

01:00:53.860 --> 01:00:54.860
Drive safe.

01:00:54.860 --> 01:00:55.860
Extra firm.

01:00:55.860 --> 01:00:56.860
Drive safe.

01:00:56.860 --> 01:00:57.860
And don't...

01:00:57.860 --> 01:00:58.860
No drinking.

01:00:58.860 --> 01:00:59.860
At the wheel this time.

01:00:59.860 --> 01:01:00.860
All right.

01:01:00.860 --> 01:01:01.860
Okay.

01:01:01.860 --> 01:01:03.380
I had a friend on LiveJournal.

01:01:03.380 --> 01:01:06.940
And I know this person doesn't listen to the show, so I'm okay to talk about this.

01:01:06.940 --> 01:01:10.060
And it's behind a friend's lock post anyway, so none of you would know who it is.

01:01:10.060 --> 01:01:12.020
And I told him I don't know how I feel about this.

01:01:12.020 --> 01:01:15.860
This is somebody, he's not a gamer in any capacity, I mean I think he's like a casual

01:01:15.860 --> 01:01:19.940
thing. You know how like most people our age have probably played Mario Brothers once in

01:01:19.940 --> 01:01:25.180
their life, you know that's about it, but not, by no means a hardcore gamer. He rounded

01:01:25.180 --> 01:01:29.220
up a team of individuals, they got I think eight people or something, and they managed

01:01:29.220 --> 01:01:34.260
to get nine platinum Xbox systems on launch day, because they all camped out at least

01:01:34.260 --> 01:01:40.560
24 hours in advance. So they all got nine platinum Xboxes. They sold all the systems

01:01:40.560 --> 01:01:47.920
on eBay, and they gave each person that stood out in line and helped them out $1,000 for

01:01:47.920 --> 01:01:51.080
their help, and they were very happy for $1,000 for their help.

01:01:51.080 --> 01:01:57.160
And they still had, after that, had left over, I think, something like $8,000 that they put

01:01:57.160 --> 01:02:01.520
$5,000 away for the baby's education because they have a new baby on the way, and the other

01:02:01.520 --> 01:02:04.000
$3,000 they just spent on themselves.

01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:06.640
And I told them, you know, I don't know what I think about this.

01:02:06.640 --> 01:02:09.760
I replied to this, I don't know what I think about this because I think you're taking advantage

01:02:09.760 --> 01:02:15.440
of people, but at the same time, you know, I blame the people that actually bid that

01:02:15.440 --> 01:02:22.400
much on eBay and allow you to think that this is a viable option for making money, you know,

01:02:22.400 --> 01:02:25.880
and I'm happy that as kids, because they're gonna invest the money, and I know they will,

01:02:25.880 --> 01:02:28.440
I know they will be smart with their money and invest the money, and they will be able

01:02:28.440 --> 01:02:34.160
to send this baby to a really great school, all based off of these Xbox 360 sales.

01:02:34.160 --> 01:02:37.280
But as a gamer, I can't help but thank you, bastard.

01:02:37.280 --> 01:02:38.480
I wanted one of those.

01:02:38.480 --> 01:02:42.980
They're taking advantage on the desperation and relative stupidity of other people.

01:02:42.980 --> 01:02:44.980
But who's to blame in that scenario?

01:02:44.980 --> 01:02:45.980
I don't know.

01:02:45.980 --> 01:02:47.980
They were well within their rights.

01:02:47.980 --> 01:02:50.980
I think, you know, it's hard for me to put the blame on them.

01:02:50.980 --> 01:02:51.980
I think they are within their rights.

01:02:51.980 --> 01:02:52.980
They are smart.

01:02:52.980 --> 01:02:53.980
They put the work into it.

01:02:53.980 --> 01:02:57.980
They put it online knowing that there were gonna be morons out there who'd bid on them.

01:02:57.980 --> 01:02:58.980
I know.

01:02:58.980 --> 01:02:59.980
It's just...

01:02:59.980 --> 01:03:00.980
I don't know.

01:03:00.980 --> 01:03:01.980
It gets my attention.

01:03:01.980 --> 01:03:03.980
I believe the idiot masses should be exploited.

01:03:03.980 --> 01:03:07.980
I just can't believe somebody would pay like $3,000 and they got it.

01:03:07.980 --> 01:03:12.980
They got it. They got like $3100 for each of these systems. It was crazy.

01:03:12.980 --> 01:03:14.980
Crazy, crazy.

01:03:14.980 --> 01:03:18.980
What can I say? People are dumb. But, you know, like I said, I'm just waiting.

01:03:18.980 --> 01:03:24.980
But if I do find one in a store, you know, if Best Buy is getting, you know, 90 in each shipment or whatever,

01:03:24.980 --> 01:03:29.980
and there's some sitting there, of course I'm going to buy one, because, you know, I can have it now,

01:03:29.980 --> 01:03:40.940
and I can get my money back from my deposit on it, and whatever. It's no big deal. Really,

01:03:40.940 --> 01:03:45.820
when I looked at the games and the four games that I got for it, I looked at, once I got

01:03:45.820 --> 01:03:50.020
those four games, I still have like $70 in store credit. I'm like, what do I buy now?

01:03:50.020 --> 01:03:53.460
And I looked at the list of everything that's coming out. I'm like, I don't want any of

01:03:53.460 --> 01:03:55.700
this. And that's kind of what it is.

01:03:55.700 --> 01:03:59.380
That's what's scaring me away from buying an Xbox 360 right now, is I really don't feel

01:03:59.380 --> 01:04:03.380
like I think it's going to be the same thing with regular Xbox I had no reason

01:04:03.380 --> 01:04:10.060
to buy a regular Xbox until halo really and even halo I wasn't a fan of halo

01:04:10.060 --> 01:04:14.060
when I first played it but I converted I it's a first-person shooter I enjoy yes

01:04:14.060 --> 01:04:19.140
you need to see perfect dark zero I do want to see Xbox 360 maybe it's all

01:04:19.140 --> 01:04:23.100
about perfect dark zero okay well I need to be talking to you as an Xbox 360

01:04:23.100 --> 01:04:27.820
owner which you you and the hubby got one of these systems all right okay we

01:04:27.820 --> 01:04:31.760
didn't. Oh, I thought, I thought. I told you we decided not to. I know, but then I thought you went back and you

01:04:31.760 --> 01:04:36.500
did. Yeah, we went and played somebody else's. Oh. And now we're gonna get one next week. Okay.

01:04:36.500 --> 01:04:41.180
Because we are gonna get one next week. Gotcha. Okay, now I make sense. Okay, so you didn't

01:04:41.180 --> 01:04:43.460
end up getting one, but you played somebody else's, so what'd you think? I

01:04:43.460 --> 01:04:46.620
haven't, I've only played the demo kiosk. I haven't played an actual system yet.

01:04:46.620 --> 01:04:51.640
There's a point where games can be too pretty, and Project Gotham 3 is too

01:04:51.640 --> 01:04:55.540
pretty. The cars look like they float over the ground. However, you do actually

01:04:55.540 --> 01:05:01.860
start off with performance vehicles as opposed to just eye candy, like one of your first

01:05:01.860 --> 01:05:10.860
cars you can pick from is the Saleen Mustang, or the new Shelby, which actually isn't even

01:05:10.860 --> 01:05:13.260
going to be out on the market to purchase until next year.

01:05:13.260 --> 01:05:17.140
Now did you play this on like a widescreen HD type setup?

01:05:17.140 --> 01:05:20.140
We played it on an HD TV, but nowhere near as huge as mine.

01:05:20.140 --> 01:05:21.620
But still, I bet it was very pretty.

01:05:21.620 --> 01:05:23.500
It was pretty, but it was too pretty.

01:05:23.500 --> 01:05:26.500
I mean, like I said, the chorus looked like they were floating over the ground.

01:05:26.500 --> 01:05:28.500
It does have good music in it, though.

01:05:28.500 --> 01:05:30.500
Some really good original music.

01:05:30.500 --> 01:05:32.500
Perfect Dark Zero was gorgeous.

01:05:32.500 --> 01:05:34.500
The levels are humongous.

01:05:34.500 --> 01:05:38.500
And there's lots of opportunity to shoot people.

01:05:38.500 --> 01:05:42.500
Wait, do you see Ghost Recon 3? Oh my God.

01:05:42.500 --> 01:05:44.500
Actually, I wasn't too interested in it.

01:05:44.500 --> 01:05:46.500
He had it. It was boring.

01:05:46.500 --> 01:05:48.500
What about Condemned? Because I remember you liked it.

01:05:48.500 --> 01:05:49.500
Did you get a chance for Condemned yet?

01:05:49.500 --> 01:05:50.500
It didn't have it.

01:05:50.500 --> 01:05:52.500
Because I remember you liked that one at E3.

01:05:52.500 --> 01:05:56.500
Maybe that was the Sega fangirl in you that liked it, I don't know.

01:05:56.500 --> 01:05:58.500
I'm looking forward to it.

01:05:58.500 --> 01:06:04.500
I'm still waiting for Perfect Dark, and I'm probably going to do, maybe, Condemned.

01:06:04.500 --> 01:06:06.500
Ridge Racer, if they send me a free copy.

01:06:06.500 --> 01:06:13.500
But, the other one we, also, because that was another game they had there too.

01:06:13.500 --> 01:06:17.500
No, it was the, whatever that war game was.

01:06:17.500 --> 01:06:19.500
Call of Duty?

01:06:19.500 --> 01:06:21.500
Call of Duty, that was it.

01:06:21.500 --> 01:06:25.620
Call of Duty was kind of boring. It was pretty but

01:06:25.620 --> 01:06:29.940
it's kind of boring. You know the weird thing is that the two games I want most on the

01:06:29.940 --> 01:06:32.140
Xbox 360 I can get on another platform.

01:06:32.140 --> 01:06:35.500
Quake 4 and Gun. Need for Speed Most Wanted having

01:06:35.500 --> 01:06:39.980
compared the Xbox version and the 3, actually this is coming from Dan.

01:06:39.980 --> 01:06:45.020
He compared the Xbox version which he's been playing non-stop and the 360 version

01:06:45.020 --> 01:06:48.140
and said that actually the Xbox version plays better.

01:06:48.140 --> 01:06:53.340
And the 360 version is apparently a slower game.

01:06:53.340 --> 01:06:54.780
Cleaned up, but slower.

01:06:54.780 --> 01:06:58.260
You know what I bet they're going to do on Xbox 360? It's going to piss me off.

01:06:58.260 --> 01:06:59.980
Put out Soulcalibur 3.

01:06:59.980 --> 01:07:03.740
That'll piss me off, because I've already bought Soulcalibur 3 for PlayStation.

01:07:03.740 --> 01:07:06.940
I have this bad feeling they're going to do it. Why are you so sure they're not going to do it?

01:07:06.940 --> 01:07:09.340
Why not? Milk more money out of us.

01:07:09.340 --> 01:07:11.540
No, they've said they're not going to.

01:07:11.540 --> 01:07:14.220
That was a rumor that was going around about it, and they said no.

01:07:14.220 --> 01:07:15.080
Why not?

01:07:15.080 --> 01:07:17.380
It's just stupid. Why wouldn't they do it?

01:07:17.380 --> 01:07:21.520
Because it's exclusive to Sony. So was Resident Evil 4.

01:07:21.520 --> 01:07:24.600
But Sony paid for the rights to have it exclusive before.

01:07:24.600 --> 01:07:28.000
And if that's the case, it might come out maybe next year or something like that.

01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:30.840
Yeah, I didn't say it's going to come out tomorrow.

01:07:30.840 --> 01:07:34.440
It would come out, you know, months after it's announced, but I bet you Soul Calibur 3 would end up

01:07:34.440 --> 01:07:36.440
getting released for the Xbox 360

01:07:36.440 --> 01:07:40.320
outside of Sony's exclusive window, and it's going to have like two new characters or

01:07:40.320 --> 01:07:45.760
something good that's going to make us all want to go buy it. And I'm going to be pissed because I already have it on PS2, but it's going to be prettier

01:07:45.760 --> 01:07:50.640
On Xbox 360 gun, I would recommend getting it on the current-gen systems

01:07:50.640 --> 01:07:54.560
because the 360 is not worth the 10 extra dollars you're paying for. It's the same damn game.

01:07:54.560 --> 01:07:56.820
No prettier graphics or anything?

01:07:56.820 --> 01:07:59.940
The texture resolution is a little bit higher. The character models

01:07:59.940 --> 01:08:01.920
have a few more polygons. That's it.

01:08:01.920 --> 01:08:06.480
Not like Night and Day. It's not like, you know, Call of Duty 2 and Big Red 1.

01:08:06.480 --> 01:08:07.360
There's

01:08:07.360 --> 01:08:08.520
uh...

01:08:08.520 --> 01:08:10.160
major differences between those.

01:08:10.160 --> 01:08:14.720
As far as Quake 4, I heard that there's problems with the frame rate in Quake 4 making it

01:08:14.720 --> 01:08:19.720
and playable in parts because it's so slow on the 360.

01:08:19.720 --> 01:08:21.720
Why didn't...

01:08:21.720 --> 01:08:27.720
These kind of mistakes kind of just ruffle my feathers. I mean, and you hear about the Xbox's crashing and everything, and it's like,

01:08:27.720 --> 01:08:30.720
if it isn't completely fucking obvious that you rushed to get this out on the market...

01:08:30.720 --> 01:08:35.720
360, they said... I've read so many things about why it's crashing and overheating and stuff.

01:08:35.720 --> 01:08:39.720
One of them, they said there's vent holes in them that some of them are getting punched out.

01:08:39.720 --> 01:08:43.720
I didn't get to see the BSOD.

01:08:43.720 --> 01:08:47.720
The black screen of death.

01:08:47.720 --> 01:08:51.720
The power supply overheats and you have to put it on something that gets

01:08:51.720 --> 01:08:55.720
proper ventilation. Yeah, that problem, they're reheating more commonly

01:08:55.720 --> 01:08:59.720
when they're kept inside of an

01:08:59.720 --> 01:09:03.720
entertainment cabinet. Oh, I see, I can see that.

01:09:03.720 --> 01:09:07.720
Because I bet you in a testing environment they don't mimic that. They're so big because they have

01:09:07.720 --> 01:09:11.720
a giant fan inside of them. It's retarded. I mean, put this stupid

01:09:11.720 --> 01:09:17.280
thing on the system and, you know, forget about it. The hard drive, they said, is overheating.

01:09:17.280 --> 01:09:22.880
Just a lot of heat problems. But then they're also, you know, saying, oh, it scratches disks

01:09:22.880 --> 01:09:28.480
and stuff. Yeah, when you knock it over, like anything, if you're playing a CD and you knock

01:09:28.480 --> 01:09:33.240
the damn thing over, obviously it's going to scratch your stupid CD. It's retarded.

01:09:33.240 --> 01:09:38.920
But that's one other thing that was going wrong with it. Problems with the hard drive

01:09:38.920 --> 01:09:44.120
being able to read stuff, just problems like that.

01:09:44.120 --> 01:09:44.920
It's widespread.

01:09:44.920 --> 01:09:47.720
And I haven't heard issues about live or anything.

01:09:47.720 --> 01:09:49.640
And when I saw live, it looked pretty cool.

01:09:49.640 --> 01:09:53.080
I think it's also a great idea that you can turn the system on

01:09:53.080 --> 01:09:55.600
and off from the controller.

01:09:55.600 --> 01:09:56.240
Oh, for real.

01:09:56.240 --> 01:09:57.000
Now, that's kind of neat.

01:09:57.000 --> 01:09:58.160
Yeah, that's pretty cool.

01:09:58.160 --> 01:10:01.680
And then I actually did get to see the iPod hookup,

01:10:01.680 --> 01:10:03.680
which was pretty cool.

01:10:03.680 --> 01:10:04.760
Interesting.

01:10:04.760 --> 01:10:07.760
And one of our podcast listeners also

01:10:07.760 --> 01:10:10.800
stated that you can actually play your iPod in-game.

01:10:10.800 --> 01:10:14.240
Oh no, that's kind of cool. Play the music in-game.

01:10:14.240 --> 01:10:17.440
And it comes out over your TV.

01:10:17.440 --> 01:10:21.320
It's kind of an interesting little perk. You just can't rip stuff from

01:10:21.320 --> 01:10:24.360
like a USB drive or anything. You can't rip

01:10:24.360 --> 01:10:27.840
from an MP3 player to your hard drive. It has to be from a CD.

01:10:27.840 --> 01:10:32.160
That's not too surprising. Yeah. That kind of feels like one of those last minute

01:10:32.160 --> 01:10:36.360
things that Microsoft just kind of put in there. It actually lets out the music in-game.

01:10:36.360 --> 01:10:38.360
Hmm. Interesting.

01:10:38.360 --> 01:10:47.360
Alright. Well, um, so, I don't know. Me personally, Xbox 360, I think I'm gonna end up waiting until next year to see some more games that are coming out.

01:10:47.360 --> 01:10:53.360
I was totally sold on getting one at launch, but, and had they been readily available everywhere, the impulse buyer in me probably would have done it.

01:10:53.360 --> 01:10:54.360
Yeah.

01:10:54.360 --> 01:10:56.360
So I'm kinda glad they weren't available everywhere.

01:10:56.360 --> 01:10:59.360
I'm buying dance for his birthday next week.

01:10:59.360 --> 01:11:01.360
That's a little different. Birthday, Christmas, you know.

01:11:01.360 --> 01:11:04.360
I was staring down some of those core systems and stuff.

01:11:04.360 --> 01:11:07.440
and stuff. And for example, there's another, there's websites out there where you can still

01:11:07.440 --> 01:11:13.960
get a 360. There's a guy that's getting in 90 next week and he's an online seller selling

01:11:13.960 --> 01:11:20.360
them for, I think slightly over what retail is or something. I don't know. But they're

01:11:20.360 --> 01:11:25.520
out there. They're, just wait until next week when the next shipment comes in and see how

01:11:25.520 --> 01:11:29.800
short they really are on these things. And I bet you anything that's gonna be, you're

01:11:29.800 --> 01:11:33.440
gonna see them in stores regularly. Because it's, what's the point, like I said before,

01:11:33.440 --> 01:11:37.680
driving the hype up if you're not going to replenish the supply. There's no point to

01:11:37.680 --> 01:11:41.880
it. And that was the whole point. They want to make it the must-have item for Christmas.

01:11:41.880 --> 01:11:46.520
If it's going to be the must-have item for Christmas, you've got to have some for Christmas,

01:11:46.520 --> 01:11:47.520
so...

01:11:47.520 --> 01:11:53.560
Yeah, I know. And of course, one of our chatters, Rene, reminding us of the golden rule of gaming,

01:11:53.560 --> 01:11:57.920
a system is only as good as the games that are on it. And that, fundamentally, I think

01:11:57.920 --> 01:12:02.100
is a problem. Well, there are some good games for Xbox 360, but for me, my kind of games,

01:12:02.100 --> 01:12:06.820
the role-playing games and the other type of games, there's just not enough.

01:12:06.820 --> 01:12:13.820
What I'm waiting to hear is I heard that the 360, some of the games may not be region-coded,

01:12:14.740 --> 01:12:19.140
in which case they are not sure if they're region-coding everything or not, because if

01:12:19.140 --> 01:12:22.820
they're not, then you can import like crazy.

01:12:22.820 --> 01:12:25.740
I've heard that rumor as well. That would be, you know, it's, you gotta just do away

01:12:25.740 --> 01:12:26.820
with that region-coding.

01:12:26.820 --> 01:12:28.540
PS3's doing it.

01:12:28.540 --> 01:12:32.540
If I pay 70 bucks to import a Japanese game, then shit, I should just play it.

01:12:32.540 --> 01:12:34.540
PSP doesn't have region-coded games.

01:12:34.540 --> 01:12:35.540
Neither does Dio.

01:12:35.540 --> 01:12:36.540
It's about time they got rid of the...

01:12:36.540 --> 01:12:37.540
I mean, I always thought...

01:12:37.540 --> 01:12:41.540
I understood the reason behind it was to keep games per market

01:12:41.540 --> 01:12:45.540
and track them and all kinds of other super-marketing crap.

01:12:45.540 --> 01:12:47.540
But thanks to the internet, we live in a worldwide market now,

01:12:47.540 --> 01:12:49.540
and I think people are coming to understand that.

01:12:49.540 --> 01:12:50.540
That's what I was going to say, actually.

01:12:50.540 --> 01:12:51.540
What I'm...

01:12:51.540 --> 01:12:53.540
I'm sorry.

01:12:53.540 --> 01:12:57.540
What I'm thinking is, the only regions they should have are PAL and,

01:12:57.540 --> 01:13:02.420
you know NTSC. Well yeah, that makes sense. They should get rid of PAL altogether.

01:13:02.420 --> 01:13:08.100
But isn't it, when we move into the HDTV age, isn't it all standardized?

01:13:08.100 --> 01:13:11.620
Or am I wrong? It's still, maybe some tech junkies in the chat know.

01:13:11.620 --> 01:13:16.700
Technically, I've played PAL discs using my DVD player on my laptop rather than through my TV.

01:13:16.700 --> 01:13:20.820
It worked just fine.

01:13:20.820 --> 01:13:24.220
Interesting. But I'm wondering in the HDTV, with the new HDTVs, because it's a new

01:13:24.220 --> 01:13:27.900
Like, basically the issue between NTSC and PAL is resolution, right?

01:13:27.900 --> 01:13:32.600
So aren't HDTV's resolutions standardized throughout the world, or am I wrong?

01:13:32.600 --> 01:13:33.600
I think they are.

01:13:33.600 --> 01:13:34.600
I do believe so.

01:13:34.600 --> 01:13:35.600
Then good.

01:13:35.600 --> 01:13:36.600
It's like using a computer monitor.

01:13:36.600 --> 01:13:37.600
Yeah.

01:13:37.600 --> 01:13:38.600
Then good.

01:13:38.600 --> 01:13:42.760
Then we're moving towards a standardized there, too, so, you know, and that would be good

01:13:42.760 --> 01:13:46.720
news for overseas people as well, at some point, because that's gonna, that's the reason

01:13:46.720 --> 01:13:51.320
why it takes them so damn long to get their games, usually, is because they have to redo

01:13:51.320 --> 01:13:54.080
all the resolution and stuff, so that's good news for them.

01:13:54.080 --> 01:13:57.100
through multiple languages from the start, boom, done.

01:13:57.100 --> 01:14:00.000
I know. We'll see what happens. Alright, we're going to do one more break. I know he said

01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:02.940
we'd do skype line. We will do that when we come back. We're also going to do the cage

01:14:02.940 --> 01:14:07.480
match and anything else we feel like. But I have to go potty, so that means...and Loki's

01:14:07.480 --> 01:14:11.760
going to beat me to it. I have to go potty, so that means we have to break. So we'll be

01:14:11.760 --> 01:14:16.200
back after this. In this break, we'll start it off with a little bit of Super Star. Remember

01:14:16.200 --> 01:14:19.160
this song? Dark Sakura? We used to love this song. I still do, but...

01:14:19.160 --> 01:14:22.040
It used to be my PA song. Dancing to this song was wonderful.

01:14:22.040 --> 01:14:24.040
It used to be my P.A. song, Good Times.

01:14:52.040 --> 01:14:53.040
You never beat me

01:14:53.040 --> 01:14:54.040
And I'm just your partner

01:14:54.040 --> 01:14:55.040
So let me just go

01:14:55.040 --> 01:14:56.040
I can't even write what you made

01:14:56.040 --> 01:14:57.040
Just write me down

01:14:57.040 --> 01:14:58.040
It's going through retirement

01:14:58.040 --> 01:14:59.040
And make a five point

01:14:59.040 --> 01:15:00.040
You have done it, you got me

01:15:00.040 --> 01:15:02.040
Cause you're mine and my whole life

01:15:09.040 --> 01:15:10.040
You need to break

01:15:10.040 --> 01:15:11.040
When your lines ain't changing

01:15:11.040 --> 01:15:12.040
When you're lyrical to me

01:15:12.040 --> 01:15:13.040
And when your style ain't great

01:15:13.040 --> 01:15:14.040
You got D.B.I. five

01:15:14.040 --> 01:15:15.040
Gotta pull it over, turn

01:15:15.040 --> 01:15:16.040
Your station is not worth winning

01:15:16.040 --> 01:15:17.040
When you learn that smile's not a word

01:15:17.040 --> 01:15:18.040
But when you make a move

01:15:18.040 --> 01:15:19.040
You get to dance like a ball

01:15:19.040 --> 01:15:20.040
You'll deserve like well

01:15:20.040 --> 01:15:21.040
I'm like too low

01:15:51.040 --> 01:15:53.440
Now here's a chance for everybody up and on the floor

01:15:53.440 --> 01:15:55.440
I wanna see you dance!

01:17:53.440 --> 01:18:08.440
In the evening, I'll let you know

01:18:08.440 --> 01:18:13.440
The words of your body are your symptoms

01:18:13.440 --> 01:18:18.440
And they're never gonna understand

01:18:18.440 --> 01:18:29.440
Love me, kiss me with every heaven said I'm sorry, love you

01:18:29.440 --> 01:18:37.440
Why, but every night I look at the sky

01:18:37.440 --> 01:18:44.440
All your name and my name

01:18:44.440 --> 01:18:51.440
Every night, every night

01:18:51.440 --> 01:18:58.440
Make me feel like I'm dreaming of coming back

01:20:51.440 --> 01:20:59.480
Hi-ho, Kermit the Frog here, informing you that today's broadcast of Orange Lounge Radio

01:20:59.480 --> 01:21:03.760
is brought to you by the letter B, the letter A, and the number 59.

01:21:03.760 --> 01:21:12.000
We're back here at Boys and Girls on Orange Lounge Radio, and I hope you enjoyed that

01:21:12.000 --> 01:21:13.000
break.

01:21:13.000 --> 01:21:14.680
A little, just some potpourri music there.

01:21:14.680 --> 01:21:18.360
I tried to put in some stuff that I know Jamie likes, so we haven't played in a while.

01:21:18.360 --> 01:21:22.340
I'm kind of doing stuff I think Jamie likes tonight because, you know, it's been a while

01:21:22.340 --> 01:21:27.220
since she's been here and getting to dictate the picks in my ear, but she hasn't really

01:21:27.220 --> 01:21:30.060
said a lot of songs she wants to hear tonight, so I'm playing stuff I think she'd want to

01:21:30.060 --> 01:21:31.060
hear.

01:21:31.060 --> 01:21:32.060
Am I doing good?

01:21:32.060 --> 01:21:33.060
So far, so good.

01:21:33.060 --> 01:21:34.060
So far, so good.

01:21:34.060 --> 01:21:38.340
In that break, we heard Superstar, The Safari, because I know you love The Safari, Look to

01:21:38.340 --> 01:21:41.060
the Sky, I don't know how big you are on that song, that was more for the listeners because

01:21:41.060 --> 01:21:46.300
I know that's a listener favorite, and era, Ta-Taku, which we had to do, we had to do

01:21:46.300 --> 01:21:50.200
at least one song by him. So maybe some more Jamie-inspired stuff next

01:21:50.200 --> 01:21:51.960
break. But for now, we're actually going to head

01:21:51.960 --> 01:21:58.340
on over to the Skype line, and if you would like to call us, please do so.

01:21:58.340 --> 01:22:05.340
Just head on over to www.orangelinesradio.com and click on Interact With Us.

01:22:05.600 --> 01:22:09.240
Sorry, the program was being unruly there for a minute, I had to figure out what's going

01:22:09.240 --> 01:22:12.400
on. There we go, yes, we're up and ready to go

01:22:12.400 --> 01:22:17.360
on Skype if you guys want to call in. Also we have a, oh it's, oh the Skype server might

01:22:17.360 --> 01:22:22.040
be down right now actually because it's still showing us it's connecting. So, we're going

01:22:22.040 --> 01:22:26.880
to have to proceed. Okay, we're not going to take calls to Skype just yet. Live Radio

01:22:26.880 --> 01:22:30.440
can't control and the servers go up and down boys and girls. So let's actually head on

01:22:30.440 --> 01:22:34.680
over and see what else is going on in the Bahmani world. I had mentioned earlier in

01:22:34.680 --> 01:22:39.360
the show I checked out 2DX10 style this week. I don't know if either of you guys have gotten

01:22:39.360 --> 01:22:43.880
a chance to play it. Jamie, have you really picked up 9th or 10th? I thought you got 9th,

01:22:43.880 --> 01:22:48.080
but no, you never got 9th or 10th. Is one of those things where it's kind of getting

01:22:48.080 --> 01:22:56.600
old? Kind of. I don't know. I can keep in mind, I work full-time and go to school part-time.

01:22:56.600 --> 01:23:02.880
I really don't have a lot of time left over for BB&E until the end of the semester. And

01:23:02.880 --> 01:23:08.040
I played a whole lot of 8th style over the summer, because I wasn't going to classes.

01:23:08.040 --> 01:23:13.040
But I figured that I was gonna wait and pick up 10th Style because I refused to play 9th Style.

01:23:13.040 --> 01:23:15.040
Why 9th Style?

01:23:15.040 --> 01:23:17.040
Just because of how crappy the arcade release was.

01:23:17.040 --> 01:23:19.040
Well, you know the timing's fine in the home version.

01:23:19.040 --> 01:23:20.040
It's not...

01:23:20.040 --> 01:23:22.040
But I also didn't really have much in it I liked.

01:23:22.040 --> 01:23:25.040
You know what's funny is I have just the reverse with 10th Style.

01:23:25.040 --> 01:23:29.040
Like, I played 10th Style and it's put together beautifully, and the song list is okay,

01:23:29.040 --> 01:23:35.040
and it's a really great looking game, especially because they've upped the resolution from the old 3rd, 4th styles,

01:23:35.040 --> 01:23:40.040
And it's just, it's a very sharp looking game, and it's nice, but I find that when I was playing it, I was kind of like,

01:23:40.040 --> 01:23:43.040
where's all these songs I like from 9th Style?

01:23:43.040 --> 01:23:45.040
See, I like 9th Style an awful lot.

01:23:45.040 --> 01:23:47.540
I still think 8th has the best of all of them.

01:23:47.540 --> 01:23:53.540
8th had a really solid song list, especially the arcade release, but, I don't know, I just, I do love 9th.

01:23:53.540 --> 01:23:59.040
So, as soon as I get a new controller, because we're pretty confident that the US is getting their own controller

01:23:59.040 --> 01:24:03.040
that's gonna be different, and hopefully better,

01:24:03.040 --> 01:24:05.040
That's when I'll truly get back into 2DX.

01:24:05.040 --> 01:24:09.040
But Miklasov was nice. He offered to let me borrow his 10th style and controller,

01:24:09.040 --> 01:24:11.040
because I'm supposed to be seeing him this weekend, too.

01:24:11.040 --> 01:24:14.040
And he offered to let me borrow it all week so I could really test drive it, but I said,

01:24:14.040 --> 01:24:17.040
I'm gonna be too busy with Dragon Quest VIII.

01:24:17.040 --> 01:24:22.040
Well, you know, my controller still works perfectly fine and it fell off the top of the van.

01:24:22.040 --> 01:24:24.040
I don't know how that is.

01:24:24.040 --> 01:24:26.040
I can't... You have the miracle controller.

01:24:26.040 --> 01:24:28.040
I've been doing it three times.

01:24:28.040 --> 01:24:30.040
That's still something else.

01:24:30.040 --> 01:24:40.620
I want to ask Loki about this real quick. These are some articles you posted on the

01:24:40.620 --> 01:24:45.640
site about the portable DDR and Beatmania sim games that are out there. What's going

01:24:45.640 --> 01:24:48.740
on with this? I know this isn't your sim scene up there, but what's going on with these PSP

01:24:48.740 --> 01:24:49.740
clones?

01:24:49.740 --> 01:24:57.200
Well, I mentioned last week about the old DDR1, and it's pretty cool. You get to actually

01:24:57.200 --> 01:25:07.340
it's basically StepMania for the PSP. Now, the BeatMania one, not quite so much like

01:25:07.340 --> 01:25:13.840
BeatMania for the PSP. It's more of a two-button BeatMania because the way the buttons are

01:25:13.840 --> 01:25:21.640
mapped. But you could actually, I guess, remap everything so that you could play, you know,

01:25:21.640 --> 01:25:28.360
songs using their corresponding keys, but with a PSP it's kind of hard to play 7-key

01:25:28.360 --> 01:25:36.560
BeatMania on it, obviously. I was actually installing that on my PSP right now, as you

01:25:36.560 --> 01:25:45.000
caught me. No, it looks really good, actually. They've got quite a setup for DDR and stuff.

01:25:45.000 --> 01:25:50.120
This one looks like it's more of like, I don't know, delight, delight reduplication or whatever,

01:25:50.120 --> 01:25:54.120
because you can do DDR in the BeatMania setup as well.

01:25:54.120 --> 01:25:59.120
Then they also have 2DX in normal BeatMania as well,

01:25:59.120 --> 01:26:03.120
so I'm not really sure how that works,

01:26:03.120 --> 01:26:05.120
but it looks pretty cool,

01:26:05.120 --> 01:26:09.120
and they've got really good skins for it.

01:26:09.120 --> 01:26:14.120
And both of them are available on PSP updates right now,

01:26:14.120 --> 01:26:18.120
but I think we'll be adding them maybe to the PSP site at some point.

01:26:18.120 --> 01:26:19.600
Alright, sounds good.

01:26:19.600 --> 01:26:20.600
Umm...

01:26:22.040 --> 01:26:23.960
There was one? I know there was something else I was dying to mention.

01:26:23.960 --> 01:26:24.840
Oh, STRIKE!

01:26:24.840 --> 01:26:28.840
There's lots of updates on DDR STRIKE that was going on over on DDRFreak.

01:26:28.840 --> 01:26:31.240
Some folks had found some pictures...

01:26:31.240 --> 01:26:32.600
Dammit, and I wish I'd gotten to this one.

01:26:32.600 --> 01:26:35.080
Mikolatov was here, because maybe he could have elaborated a little bit,

01:26:35.080 --> 01:26:37.400
even though I know he can't say a whole lot about work stuff.

01:26:37.400 --> 01:26:38.400
Umm...

01:26:38.400 --> 01:26:42.800
But there was some stuff going on on the threads over on DDRFreak

01:26:42.800 --> 01:26:45.920
that they found some scans in a magazine that gave away some stuff

01:26:45.920 --> 01:26:51.160
about the upcoming DDR Strike game and it looks like they were able to find in

01:26:51.160 --> 01:26:56.280
the scan of the magazine article they found that there's some new Toshiba EMI

01:26:56.280 --> 01:27:00.560
license tracks that are coming to DDR Strike which some folks speculated was

01:27:00.560 --> 01:27:03.640
going to be happening with DDR Strike but nobody was actually able to confirm.

01:27:03.640 --> 01:27:07.360
That's pretty cool. And what's interesting though, some of them are

01:27:07.360 --> 01:27:12.680
crossovers from DDR Extreme 2. For instance, as the rush comes and Block,

01:27:12.680 --> 01:27:15.360
Block, Rock, and Beats, which we had in DDR Extreme 2.

01:27:15.360 --> 01:27:20.960
But here's the weird thing, is that they have tied them to DanceMania releases, because

01:27:20.960 --> 01:27:27.740
As the Rush Comes was on DanceMania EX7, and Block, Rock, and Beats was on DanceMania Winters.

01:27:27.740 --> 01:27:30.720
So I'm not sure, it's very interesting how this worked.

01:27:30.720 --> 01:27:34.520
I don't know if, were these games chosen for the US first, or were they actually chosen

01:27:34.520 --> 01:27:37.560
for Japan, and we got them anyway because they were easy to license.

01:27:37.560 --> 01:27:38.560
We don't know.

01:27:38.560 --> 01:27:42.280
But also, apparently, the scan in the magazine, or whatever it is, also gives away a couple

01:27:42.280 --> 01:27:47.560
other songs. Heaven is a Place on Earth, the German election mix from Dance Media Covers

01:27:47.560 --> 01:27:52.840
01 and Let's Dance by David Bowie, which I think is a very sexy addition to DDR. I can't

01:27:52.840 --> 01:27:54.600
believe we're getting David Bowie. That is badass.

01:27:54.600 --> 01:27:58.020
David Bowie is so hot. He's going to be in a movie with Michael

01:27:58.020 --> 01:28:03.080
Kane. Oh, that'd be great. Can't wait. And then You Sexy Thing by Hot Chocolate, and

01:28:03.080 --> 01:28:08.780
I can't think of what song the You Sexy Thing is, though, but I think that's that old song

01:28:08.780 --> 01:28:09.780
from, uh...

01:28:09.780 --> 01:28:10.780
You Sexy Thing.

01:28:10.780 --> 01:28:11.780
You Sexy Thing.

01:28:11.780 --> 01:28:18.220
I don't think I remember hearing that song either, did it?

01:28:18.220 --> 01:28:22.100
I remember, like, the line on it, but I don't remember how the song goes.

01:28:22.100 --> 01:28:25.780
It just must be because I have completely different taste than that.

01:28:25.780 --> 01:28:26.780
I have no idea.

01:28:26.780 --> 01:28:31.940
Well, it's good to see that this game isn't just going to be a rehash of DDR Extreme 2

01:28:31.940 --> 01:28:35.700
like I was thinking it was going to be, but, I don't know, new stuff's always good.

01:28:35.700 --> 01:28:40.340
Well, I think what's also interesting is that there's some crossovers from Ultramix 2, at

01:28:40.340 --> 01:28:44.420
least one, which we can kind of infer, because there's going to be one, there will be more

01:28:44.420 --> 01:28:51.620
than one, Baille la Samba, which was the Konami original for Ultramix 2, is crossing over,

01:28:51.620 --> 01:28:56.200
and that was picked off from one of the mission mode screens, a very observant person on DDR

01:28:56.200 --> 01:28:58.420
Freak noticed that the banners match up.

01:28:58.420 --> 01:29:00.580
So Baille la Samba is going to be there as well.

01:29:00.580 --> 01:29:06.760
So that is starting speculation as to might we see some of the freebie songs, because

01:29:06.760 --> 01:29:11.940
as you know, a different drum sort of gave songs to Konami, not really had them licensed

01:29:11.940 --> 01:29:16.100
but gave them for the exposure, and that's where we got Skulk and Superstar.

01:29:16.100 --> 01:29:20.340
So it'd be very, very interesting if some of these songs showed up in the Japanese mix.

01:29:20.340 --> 01:29:21.660
I think that'd be kind of cool for them.

01:29:21.660 --> 01:29:22.660
That would be.

01:29:22.660 --> 01:29:28.500
Um, I think for sure they will get Jyris and, um, probably the Midihead mix and some of

01:29:28.500 --> 01:29:31.680
the other stuff. They'll probably get all that crap for sure. I don't see how they couldn't

01:29:31.680 --> 01:29:32.680
get that stuff.

01:29:32.680 --> 01:29:38.420
Well, also when you think about it, was it Festival had Ultramix One stuff in it, so

01:29:38.420 --> 01:29:40.880
it only makes sense that they would do that.

01:29:40.880 --> 01:29:45.200
Yeah, I think a lot of people, this really isn't surprising anyone, but it's kind of

01:29:45.200 --> 01:29:46.200
cool nonetheless.

01:29:46.200 --> 01:29:52.800
So, what else we got going on with Strike? Then this came up later in the thread, is

01:29:52.800 --> 01:29:56.600
that somebody actually got a screenshot and knew enough Japanese to kind of translate

01:29:56.600 --> 01:30:01.200
the little tiny, um, stuff that shows up there on the side, and notices that there is no

01:30:01.200 --> 01:30:05.000
online mode for the Japanese, uh, DDR Strike release.

01:30:05.000 --> 01:30:10.720
Uh, interesting. I don't know if that's because DDR they don't think is popular over there?

01:30:10.720 --> 01:30:13.480
I'm not sure. I'm not sure what to think of this, why they're not doing the online mode.

01:30:13.480 --> 01:30:15.400
Or maybe it's just an early screenshot. Who knows?

01:30:15.400 --> 01:30:22.160
Or maybe because the Extreme 2 Online sucked? That's true, too. Doesn't it have bugs, too?

01:30:22.160 --> 01:30:24.560
Aren't people still cheating on there and stuff?

01:30:24.560 --> 01:30:29.240
sucked apparently compared to the Xbox one it does it's too bad that extreme 2

01:30:29.240 --> 01:30:33.800
came out later but I realize there's a lot of anti Microsoft people for lack of

01:30:33.800 --> 01:30:37.720
a better term people that don't have Xbox's for financial just don't want to

01:30:37.720 --> 01:30:42.720
whatever reasons that haven't gone to experience the Xbox live and I'll tell

01:30:42.720 --> 01:30:46.960
you what guys I used to be anti Microsoft too and in some in some

01:30:46.960 --> 01:30:50.760
circumstances I still am to some extent I don't like some of the things they do

01:30:50.760 --> 01:30:55.680
do but I've come to accept embrace some of the things that are really great

01:30:55.680 --> 01:30:59.600
about Xbox one of them being they have advanced videos or the other one being

01:30:59.600 --> 01:31:06.200
that they have the best online system that kicks ps2's but I mean Xbox Live

01:31:06.200 --> 01:31:09.840
kicks anything else's but basically right now that's out there in the

01:31:09.840 --> 01:31:14.920
console world and so to go and play DDR on the Xbox Live and then go to play it

01:31:14.920 --> 01:31:18.600
on Xtreme 2 you're like yeah this sucks but I bet for people that have never

01:31:18.600 --> 01:31:22.840
played Xbox Live they probably don't know that it can be a lot better so it

01:31:22.840 --> 01:31:26.960
works out just fine for them so yeah I don't know still kind of interesting if

01:31:26.960 --> 01:31:33.280
they left it out who knows of course more to come still on this game we will

01:31:33.280 --> 01:31:37.480
see what happens a little later I'm sure the surprise is still left in store who

01:31:37.480 --> 01:31:42.320
knows let's see if we can get Skype working I'm having the worst problems

01:31:42.320 --> 01:31:48.300
getting this Skype program to work if I'm unable to get this to happen what

01:31:48.300 --> 01:31:51.420
we'll do is we'll probably go to the cage match yeah Skype is doing some

01:31:51.420 --> 01:31:57.480
weird stuff with me guys that's gonna be too bad if we have to do a show without

01:31:57.480 --> 01:32:00.600
Skype because I'd love to hear from our listeners we'd love to hear what they

01:32:00.600 --> 01:32:05.580
have to say let's try this one more time here we're gonna try connecting there

01:32:05.580 --> 01:32:11.600
and yeah I got booted again that's great okay so we're gonna go ahead and actually

01:32:11.600 --> 01:32:14.360
we're gonna go into the cage match for right now and try to get some time for

01:32:14.360 --> 01:32:17.280
Skype to come back up and we'll go to the Skype line a little later in the

01:32:17.280 --> 01:32:20.360
show and I'm sorry guys I don't know what's happening there I'm having timeout

01:32:20.360 --> 01:32:23.960
problems some of you might be on it we're just having some problems here in

01:32:23.960 --> 01:32:27.080
studio so I'm going to try some other things here while we go into the cage

01:32:27.080 --> 01:32:34.920
match but it is time to get into this week's cage match now the nice thing

01:32:34.920 --> 01:32:37.680
about cage matches that we don't need our skype line for cage match we only

01:32:37.680 --> 01:32:41.120
need the chat room so you gotta be in our chat room if you want to vote in

01:32:41.120 --> 01:32:44.840
cage match and that's www.orangelaundraider.com and click on chat and

01:32:44.840 --> 01:32:55.840
And the way the Cage Match works is that we're going to play three songs for you guys, and your favorite song will go into rotation all week long on Orange Lounge Radio's Bomani and Video Game Music program.

01:32:55.840 --> 01:32:59.840
And we had a winning song last week, it was a brand new winner, and it was something that Loki picked.

01:32:59.840 --> 01:33:03.840
And the song was by John Sykes, and it was called Cautionary Warning.

01:33:03.840 --> 01:33:06.840
And anything else you want to say about this song, Loki?

01:33:06.840 --> 01:33:07.840
Your mic's off.

01:33:07.840 --> 01:33:09.840
Uh, it's just a really cool song.

01:33:09.840 --> 01:33:15.840
Okay, here it is, a clip of last week's winner, John Sykes, with cautionary warning, and here's a clip.

01:33:39.840 --> 01:34:07.840
You are my excavator, you are my space invader

01:34:07.840 --> 01:34:10.600
Oh, I should never have warned that I would go

01:34:10.600 --> 01:34:12.600
You are my kind of ganger

01:34:12.600 --> 01:34:14.840
You are my indicator

01:34:14.840 --> 01:34:16.840
You are my egg of a maker

01:34:16.840 --> 01:34:19.840
Oh, I should never have warned that I would go

01:34:29.840 --> 01:34:32.340
Don't tear you down, have you locked yourself to the floor?

01:34:32.340 --> 01:34:34.340
You're the one who believed in saying your soul

01:34:34.340 --> 01:34:36.340
Now only time will tell

01:35:06.340 --> 01:35:13.340
All right, that was song number one in tonight's cage match, a clip of last week's winner John

01:35:15.700 --> 01:35:20.040
Sykes, cautionary warning. Well, now I'm remembering that song. That's the one where the Whitesnake

01:35:20.040 --> 01:35:25.780
guitarist or something has something to do with that, right, Logie?

01:35:25.780 --> 01:35:26.700
That's very correct.

01:35:26.700 --> 01:35:30.300
All right, interesting. All right, song number two in tonight's cage match will be my pick.

01:35:30.300 --> 01:35:35.140
I'm going to go ahead and go. My song is, too bad Miklos has not here because he talked

01:35:35.140 --> 01:35:39.540
the song up for me. My song is by an artist named Andy Bell, and Andy Bell was half of

01:35:39.540 --> 01:35:45.540
Racer, you know, the great 80s and 90s synth-pop band. I love synth-pop. Andy Bell has a solo

01:35:45.540 --> 01:35:55.540
album out now, and it's pretty cool. I like... I had to put in a... Fuckin' mic, I hit this

01:35:55.540 --> 01:35:59.580
mic. You know I love me some synth-pop! So I had to put this in because Andy Bell is

01:35:59.580 --> 01:36:03.260
one of the granddaddies of synth-pop, going back to Yaz and all these other great bands.

01:36:03.260 --> 01:36:06.760
I love this song, it's the latest CD, Electric Blue, it's song number two in tonight's cage,

01:36:06.760 --> 01:36:08.760
much crazy here on Orange Lodge Radio.

01:36:36.760 --> 01:36:39.760
You better make some noise

01:36:39.760 --> 01:36:43.760
Cause my desire

01:36:43.760 --> 01:36:46.760
Is running down a city street

01:36:46.760 --> 01:36:50.760
Hold me up to the wire

01:36:50.760 --> 01:36:53.760
I'm driven by a heavy beat

01:36:53.760 --> 01:36:57.760
When you put your hand in my hand

01:36:57.760 --> 01:37:01.760
I go down and I go crazy for you

01:37:01.760 --> 01:37:05.760
Crazy, crazy

01:37:05.760 --> 01:37:08.760
Crazy

01:37:08.760 --> 01:37:12.760
I feel so ashamed to tell you

01:37:12.760 --> 01:37:17.760
I go down there, I go crazy for you

01:37:17.760 --> 01:37:20.760
Crazy, crazy

01:37:20.760 --> 01:37:23.760
Crazy

01:37:23.760 --> 01:37:40.760
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

01:37:40.760 --> 01:37:48.760
And that she was good You never told a lie

01:37:48.760 --> 01:37:54.760
And if you're sweet tonight, I'll have an alibi

01:37:54.760 --> 01:38:01.760
Cause my desire is running down a city street

01:38:01.760 --> 01:38:05.760
Hold me up to the wire

01:38:05.760 --> 01:38:08.760
I'm driven by a heavy beat

01:38:08.760 --> 01:38:12.760
When you put your hand in my hand

01:38:12.760 --> 01:38:17.760
I go down and I go crazy for you

01:38:17.760 --> 01:38:19.760
Crazy, crazy

01:38:19.760 --> 01:38:23.760
Crazy, crazy

01:38:23.760 --> 01:38:27.760
I feel so ashamed to tell you

01:38:27.760 --> 01:38:32.760
I go down, man, I go crazy for you

01:38:32.760 --> 01:38:34.760
Crazy, crazy

01:38:34.760 --> 01:38:38.760
Every day

01:38:54.760 --> 01:38:58.760
Cause my desire

01:38:58.760 --> 01:39:01.760
Is running down a city street

01:39:01.760 --> 01:39:05.760
Hold me up, choose a wire

01:39:05.760 --> 01:39:08.760
I'll dribble by your heavy knees

01:39:08.760 --> 01:39:12.760
When you put your hand in my hand

01:39:12.760 --> 01:39:16.760
I go down, then I go crazy for you

01:39:16.760 --> 01:39:23.760
Crazy, crazy

01:39:23.760 --> 01:39:27.760
I feel so ashamed to tell you

01:39:27.760 --> 01:39:37.580
And I go, and I go raging for you crazy, crazy

01:39:57.760 --> 01:40:08.320
Okay, there's song number two in tonight's cage mesh, and it's Andy Bell with Crazy,

01:40:08.320 --> 01:40:11.800
and we'll go around and see what folks thought of that, if they were crazy for that song

01:40:11.800 --> 01:40:12.800
or it drove them crazy.

01:40:12.800 --> 01:40:13.800
Dork Sucko, you're up first.

01:40:13.800 --> 01:40:14.800
No offense, it was a little repetitive.

01:40:14.800 --> 01:40:15.800
I didn't write it.

01:40:15.800 --> 01:40:16.800
Oh, no.

01:40:16.800 --> 01:40:27.080
It was okay, it wasn't a bad song, but I just find it a little repetitive and kind

01:40:27.080 --> 01:40:32.920
boring so it gets 6.5. I've been blasting a song in my car all week. I really like it.

01:40:32.920 --> 01:40:41.880
Uh, 9. Loki, that song's craaazy. I'll hold 7.5. Okay, alright, moving on to song number

01:40:41.880 --> 01:40:47.240
3 in tonight's gauge match, Dark Sakura. Who'd you pick for us? Um, because this song's on

01:40:47.240 --> 01:40:51.960
a Saturday, which is usually the day I think about what I'm gonna play, um, I just picked

01:40:51.960 --> 01:40:58.960
the Blur song so it's a crazy beat. Alright, sound over 3 in tonight's cage match. Blur!

01:40:58.960 --> 01:41:01.600
Blur! With Crazy Beat. Enjoy.

01:41:58.960 --> 01:42:27.960
I'm on my own about to start a revolution Got a hand for a party I've been dying to get in

01:42:27.960 --> 01:42:32.960
Like me, I hear that my body makes me sick

01:42:32.960 --> 01:42:34.960
And I love to hear that say

01:42:34.960 --> 01:42:37.960
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

01:42:37.960 --> 01:42:40.960
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

01:42:40.960 --> 01:42:43.960
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

01:42:43.960 --> 01:42:46.960
I love my sister and I love her tonight

01:42:46.960 --> 01:43:01.960
Breakdown

01:44:01.960 --> 01:44:08.960
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

01:44:08.960 --> 01:44:11.960
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

01:44:16.960 --> 01:44:22.960
Okay, there was song number 3 in tonight's cage match. That was Blur with Crazy Beat.

01:44:22.960 --> 01:44:26.960
Once again, are you crazy about that song or did it drive you crazy? Dark Sakura.

01:44:26.960 --> 01:44:30.960
It's actually not my favorite Blur song, but I like it.

01:44:34.960 --> 01:44:36.960
Give it to me an 8.5.

01:44:36.960 --> 01:44:41.960
For me, it works better for Cagemash than I thought it would. I still think it was a little bit noisy.

01:44:41.960 --> 01:44:45.960
I don't really know how it would just go. A little bit noisy? But it's cool.

01:44:45.960 --> 01:44:50.960
I mean, it's a fun kick some butt anthem. I like that.

01:44:50.960 --> 01:44:58.960
You know, it's a good song to kind of rotate with song 2, because I know a lot of people are all about song 2, and that's the only Blur song they know of song 2.

01:44:58.960 --> 01:45:05.960
But that's a good one to kind of mix it up a little bit with, because it reminds me of song 2, but it's different! Which is a good thing.

01:45:05.960 --> 01:45:08.960
So, um, I give it an 8. I liked it.

01:45:08.960 --> 01:45:09.960
Loki.

01:45:09.960 --> 01:45:12.960
That song was crazy!

01:45:12.960 --> 01:45:13.960
7.5.

01:45:13.960 --> 01:45:20.960
I just thought it would be funny, since both songs are crazy.

01:45:24.960 --> 01:45:31.960
It's time for you guys to vote as soon as we recap. Here we go, the three songs you

01:45:31.960 --> 01:45:35.760
to vote as soon as we recap here we go the three songs you can vote for tonight

01:45:35.760 --> 01:45:42.080
starting off with song number one which is Cautionary Warning

01:45:47.480 --> 01:45:53.480
and song number two you can vote for tonight is Andy Bell with Crazy

01:45:53.480 --> 01:45:58.480
Crazy, crazy, crazy

01:45:58.480 --> 01:46:02.480
And song number three you can vote for tonight is Blur with Crazy Beat

01:46:02.480 --> 01:46:10.480
Blur with Crazy Beat

01:46:10.480 --> 01:46:16.480
Alright kids, you know what to do. Place vote now. Send a private message to Sky in the chatroom with your vote

01:46:16.480 --> 01:46:21.480
and we will reveal the winner of the vote as soon as we can

01:46:21.480 --> 01:46:24.800
Moving on over to Loki to talk about what else is going on in the Sims scene

01:46:24.800 --> 01:46:28.000
besides the PSP thing, which, by the way, you actually showed me because you

01:46:28.000 --> 01:46:29.800
downloaded it there during the last little bit.

01:46:29.800 --> 01:46:33.300
It's pretty cool. That actually looks kinda neat. The skin's a little fucked because your

01:46:33.300 --> 01:46:35.080
life bar's in the middle of the screen, but...

01:46:35.080 --> 01:46:38.920
Well, there's four skins. I haven't tried the other four skins.

01:46:38.920 --> 01:46:42.240
I walked right into that joke.

01:46:42.240 --> 01:46:45.960
No, there's supposedly four different skins for it.

01:46:45.960 --> 01:46:50.280
It's weird, though, because you can do, like, DDR and stuff, but I haven't actually tried some of the

01:46:50.280 --> 01:46:50.920
other skins.

01:46:50.920 --> 01:46:56.920
I've been basically using a default one. I don't really notice the life bar in the middle, so it's not a big problem for me.

01:46:56.920 --> 01:47:06.920
The keys, though, are a little fucked up, but I probably should have not been trying to play one key P1807. That just didn't work very well.

01:47:06.920 --> 01:47:09.920
No wonder you had one key assigned to all your buttons. What was that about?

01:47:09.920 --> 01:47:14.920
Well, that's the default settings they have. Try doing seven key on a PSP.

01:47:14.920 --> 01:47:17.920
But then why point the damn thing to a PSP?

01:47:17.920 --> 01:47:24.460
I don't know. But 5-key though works pretty well. So I am getting some nice 5-key SIM

01:47:24.460 --> 01:47:30.060
files to try on it, because I don't know, it could work for that.

01:47:30.060 --> 01:47:35.680
Other than that, there is some stuff going on. I know on BomaniStyle right now, they

01:47:35.680 --> 01:47:43.320
are actually doing OSC4, which is another SIM file contest, not to be confused with

01:47:43.320 --> 01:47:49.720
with Turning Mix, which is not going on anymore. But, anyways, OSC4, I believe, is available

01:47:49.720 --> 01:47:54.640
for download right now. You can check it out. They've got some links on their front page

01:47:54.640 --> 01:48:01.760
there, and they also kind of talk about who's judging and how it's going to go and that

01:48:01.760 --> 01:48:06.320
type of stuff. So, check it out now. It's the keyboard division, so these are all going

01:48:06.320 --> 01:48:10.400
to be the ones that are impossible to play, so check those out.

01:48:10.400 --> 01:48:12.200
Not you, we're laughing at the chatroom.

01:48:12.200 --> 01:48:13.000
No, that's alright.

01:48:13.000 --> 01:48:19.000
Somebody just said, somebody just joined and we said that they missed the cage match and their response was, and I quote,

01:48:19.000 --> 01:48:21.000
Shit shit shitty shit shit.

01:48:23.000 --> 01:48:25.200
It's the little things in life that amuse me. Anyway, sorry.

01:48:25.200 --> 01:48:27.000
I'm glad that everyone likes that.

01:48:27.600 --> 01:48:34.000
Which, by the way, is when I think about a large part of the Bimani files that are being put out lately as shit shit shitty shit shit.

01:48:34.000 --> 01:48:34.800
Those sim files.

01:48:34.800 --> 01:48:37.460
since you mentioned shit shit shitty shit shit

01:48:37.460 --> 01:48:40.160
uh... i have to mention

01:48:40.160 --> 01:48:44.120
sim files for the week and uh... starting off with

01:48:44.120 --> 01:48:47.600
max don't have sex with your ex not exactly a max remix but still you know

01:48:47.600 --> 01:48:48.960
falls under the max category

01:48:48.960 --> 01:48:51.760
uh... max three hundred the miss remix

01:48:51.760 --> 01:48:55.760
uh... max three hundred pack which means probably more than one max

01:48:55.760 --> 01:48:59.040
uh... three hundred in there max max max stinks

01:48:59.040 --> 01:49:02.120
and max three forty

01:49:02.120 --> 01:49:09.120
Max Stinks? Max Stink. No, not Max Stinks, as in Max Stink, like Maximum Stink.

01:49:09.120 --> 01:49:14.840
That sounds like an anti-deodorant. Like, instead of, you know, like Right Guard Max,

01:49:14.840 --> 01:49:22.640
it's Max Stink. But to be fair, what I'm going to do is I'm going to download Max Stink to

01:49:22.640 --> 01:49:28.240
my PSP and play it on the DDR simulator. Yeah. No, actually, no I'm not, because I'm not

01:49:28.240 --> 01:49:35.920
waste that space on my PSP. Now, the other thing I was kind of curious about with PSP,

01:49:35.920 --> 01:49:43.160
hypothetically, couldn't you use that little USB adapter to hypothetically use a Kinky

01:49:43.160 --> 01:49:50.080
Joy to hypothetically put in a PlayStation 2 2DX controller? No. No, because the way

01:49:50.080 --> 01:49:59.080
way the USB things works. However, you could, in theory, put a portable keyboard which uses

01:49:59.080 --> 01:50:01.840
the infrared port and use that for BeatMania.

01:50:01.840 --> 01:50:03.440
Now, there's an idea.

01:50:03.440 --> 01:50:04.440
Or...

01:50:04.440 --> 01:50:08.040
And it's like that one game. What was that BeatMania game, dah, dah, dah, or something

01:50:08.040 --> 01:50:10.000
that they put out? It was a keyboard BeatMania game?

01:50:10.000 --> 01:50:11.000
Yeah.

01:50:11.000 --> 01:50:12.000
Oh, my gosh.

01:50:12.000 --> 01:50:17.920
You know what's interesting, though, is the USB port, people are saying that you can't

01:50:17.920 --> 01:50:21.960
really put stuff in there, um, like, you know, peripherals and stuff, but they have that

01:50:21.960 --> 01:50:25.280
new talk band coming out for it, and it looks like, because the problem was they couldn't

01:50:25.280 --> 01:50:29.520
get power off of the port. There was no power going through it, so that's why it's not working.

01:50:29.520 --> 01:50:33.840
But I looked at the side of this port here, and there's these two little, like, um, copper,

01:50:33.840 --> 01:50:39.640
uh, contact points where the power comes through. So apparently you can get power from it, and

01:50:39.640 --> 01:50:45.520
therefore run devices and stuff. Um, so, I guess in theory you could hook up a dance

01:50:45.520 --> 01:50:46.600
patter

01:50:46.600 --> 01:50:49.320
but why would you want to but if you're going to be like home

01:50:49.320 --> 01:50:53.080
can you bet just imagine for a minute holding a psp while you're dancing do

01:50:53.080 --> 01:50:59.080
you do you think you know how stupid you'd look to somebody who's coming by

01:50:59.080 --> 01:51:00.040
seriously

01:51:00.040 --> 01:51:03.740
uh...

01:51:03.740 --> 01:51:06.760
yes i i i have an idea what that look like

01:51:06.760 --> 01:51:10.200
i've done with the controller before you know somebody posted

01:51:10.200 --> 01:51:13.600
excuse me somebody posted on our forums over at orange launcher radio dot com which by the way

01:51:13.600 --> 01:51:17.320
I'm very proud of our audience, what might I say, and I think the podcast is a large

01:51:17.320 --> 01:51:20.720
part of what to thank for this, but I'm very proud of our audience overall, Sunday night

01:51:20.720 --> 01:51:25.600
show audience and podcast audience, for making our forums relatively active recently in the

01:51:25.600 --> 01:51:28.860
past couple of months. They've gotten relatively active. And one of the things that somebody

01:51:28.860 --> 01:51:33.500
was posting about was using, now the weird thing is that the title of the post said using

01:51:33.500 --> 01:51:38.760
PSP to charge the iPod. And then in the post they were talking about the PlayStation 2

01:51:38.760 --> 01:51:44.400
charging an iPod. So, hypothetically, both would work, though, right? Because the PlayStation

01:51:44.400 --> 01:51:48.440
2 has USB on it, and like you said, the PSP has the little power thing on it, so you could

01:51:48.440 --> 01:51:52.100
use your PSP to charge your iPod, which is a really stupid idea if you think about it,

01:51:52.100 --> 01:51:53.100
but it would work, right?

01:51:53.100 --> 01:51:56.780
Well, the problem is that it's not a standard USB, it's the Mini-B, so you'd have to have

01:51:56.780 --> 01:52:01.240
like some sort of adapter, but yes, I guess it's possible. Maybe, well, I don't know if

01:52:01.240 --> 01:52:05.520
power's going directly to that all the time, I don't know, but I'd imagine it has to be

01:52:05.520 --> 01:52:06.520
if it's...

01:52:06.520 --> 01:52:07.520
Maybe it'd have to be in USB mode for it to work.

01:52:07.520 --> 01:52:12.880
There's, like, um, on everything, there's these copper contact points by all the, um,

01:52:12.880 --> 01:52:18.760
like, the AC adapter and also by the USB. It's, um, I think this is for cradle is why

01:52:18.760 --> 01:52:23.680
they have that there, so you can just sit it down in something. Um, and then, of course,

01:52:23.680 --> 01:52:28.320
the other one for the, um, peripherals that go into it, because they have screw points

01:52:28.320 --> 01:52:34.340
where you can screw something in. Um, but, yeah, I guess you could do that, but, um,

01:52:34.340 --> 01:52:36.340
Why would you want to, honestly?

01:52:36.340 --> 01:52:39.340
Because people will do something just because they can.

01:52:39.340 --> 01:52:45.340
Explain why people install Linux on a Billy Bass, on a Toaster, on Hello Kitty watches.

01:52:45.340 --> 01:52:48.340
There is Linux on a Toaster.

01:52:48.340 --> 01:52:52.340
Why do people do that, Loki? Because they can.

01:52:52.340 --> 01:52:58.340
Seriously, I mean, if you figure out that you can charge your iPod using your PSP or whatever,

01:52:58.340 --> 01:52:59.340
aren't you going to show that to somebody?

01:52:59.340 --> 01:53:04.580
somebody, like, dude, I could charge my iPod with my PSP. That's cool.

01:53:04.580 --> 01:53:07.900
First off, you never hear me say that because I'll never have an iPod.

01:53:07.900 --> 01:53:12.620
Yes, I do. That's another story, but I guess. I don't

01:53:12.620 --> 01:53:16.900
know. All right. Here's the status with Skype, you

01:53:16.900 --> 01:53:20.220
guys. We're trying to get into Skype, but the weird thing is whenever we try, and I

01:53:20.220 --> 01:53:24.620
realize I hear you guys in the chat room loud and clear saying you see us online, but I've

01:53:24.620 --> 01:53:28.420
tried calling the back number, the phone number that you can call to get into us, too, and

01:53:28.420 --> 01:53:32.200
not working. It's not ringing on our computer. So even if you guys tried to call us, we are

01:53:32.200 --> 01:53:36.160
not seeing it. So even though you guys are seeing us logged in, Skype, we are not actually

01:53:36.160 --> 01:53:40.120
there. We are trying to log in, but the problem is I'm getting caught in a loop on Skype,

01:53:40.120 --> 01:53:44.320
is that I log in and then it says logging in and then kicks me back out to the log in

01:53:44.320 --> 01:53:48.880
screen. So I don't know what's going on. Usually what I would do is I would just reset Skype

01:53:48.880 --> 01:53:52.600
or reinstall Skype to get this to work. Problem is, guys, we're in the middle of a show. In

01:53:52.600 --> 01:53:55.440
order for me to reinstall Skype, I'd have to dump all the listeners because Skype fucks

01:53:55.440 --> 01:53:59.720
with your audio settings when it reinstalls itself, so that's not an option, so we may

01:53:59.720 --> 01:54:04.320
be without Skype tonight. I will keep trying throughout the rest of the show, though. If

01:54:04.320 --> 01:54:07.660
it doesn't work, you know, we'll do Ask Orange Lounge or something where you guys will be

01:54:07.660 --> 01:54:11.380
able to interact with us, at least via the chat room, if nothing else, because we do

01:54:11.380 --> 01:54:14.540
want to hear what our listeners have to say, and I want to hear about your Thanksgivings

01:54:14.540 --> 01:54:17.940
and stuff. Very sorry about Skype, but this is one of those things where it's kind of

01:54:17.940 --> 01:54:21.540
out of our ballpark right now, so we'll keep trying. I'm going to keep trying to hammer

01:54:21.540 --> 01:54:25.700
in there and clear some stuff out and see what I can do.

01:54:25.700 --> 01:54:30.140
I can't wait for Animal Crossing. Yes, Animal Crossing is what? Not next week,

01:54:30.140 --> 01:54:32.740
but the week after, right? December 5th or something?

01:54:32.740 --> 01:54:35.740
7th, the week of the 7th. Oh, I'm so excited.

01:54:35.740 --> 01:54:39.540
It's coming out, it'll be awesome. That's gonna be the coolest thing.

01:54:39.540 --> 01:54:42.060
We don't know a lot about this game, though, right? We don't know a lot about the way it's

01:54:42.060 --> 01:54:44.220
really gonna work. The site launch, that's about it.

01:54:44.220 --> 01:54:47.660
I played it. You played it? How? At E3?

01:54:47.660 --> 01:54:54.100
So E3 answers some questions about it, but it doesn't tell us how online is going to

01:54:54.100 --> 01:54:55.100
work.

01:54:55.100 --> 01:54:56.100
That's really what I'm curious about.

01:54:56.100 --> 01:54:59.020
Can I go into Dark Sakura's village and cut down all her trees?

01:54:59.020 --> 01:55:04.180
If you want Dark Sakura to go into your village and set fire to it.

01:55:04.180 --> 01:55:09.660
Am I going to be able to go into Dark Sakura's village and teach all of her villagers to

01:55:09.660 --> 01:55:11.660
say, you smell like butt?

01:55:11.660 --> 01:55:18.660
Hey, you had Olivia in my village saying something rather foul.

01:55:18.660 --> 01:55:26.660
It was cunt, ladies and gentlemen. The word was cunt. I was sophomoric and juvenile, and I thought it was funny to get one of my Animal Crossing villagers to say cunt.

01:55:26.660 --> 01:55:27.660
But...

01:55:27.660 --> 01:55:34.660
She moved into your village, and then I got her back, because she was my favorite.

01:55:34.660 --> 01:55:35.660
And she was foul.

01:55:35.660 --> 01:55:39.660
She was going around foul-mouthed, and then her neighbor started saying it too.

01:55:39.660 --> 01:55:48.660
I don't remember who moved to my town, Big Cock, but it was funny to everybody talking about Big Cock all the time.

01:55:48.660 --> 01:55:52.660
We had Danville. Because of Dan.

01:55:52.660 --> 01:55:59.660
Oh yeah, I remember that. You had Danville. I had just, I don't even remember what I called my town. It was Sky Place? I don't remember what it was.

01:55:59.660 --> 01:56:00.660
That's sad.

01:56:00.660 --> 01:56:04.660
I don't remember the name of my town.

01:56:04.660 --> 01:56:07.660
I like Big Cock. I like that.

01:56:07.660 --> 01:56:09.660
We have Rob on air, save any life.

01:56:09.660 --> 01:56:11.660
Shut up. Shut up.

01:56:13.660 --> 01:56:15.660
I hate you.

01:56:21.660 --> 01:56:23.660
Wow, that was scary.

01:56:23.660 --> 01:56:27.660
That didn't get all picked up on microphone, but Jamie went from laughing to laughing.

01:56:30.660 --> 01:56:32.660
There she goes. Sorry.

01:56:32.660 --> 01:56:34.660
You try coughing up a lung cookie.

01:56:34.660 --> 01:56:36.660
It'll be all the equations it makes you.

01:56:36.660 --> 01:56:40.060
Here's what I remember about Animal Crossing is that I got that

01:56:40.620 --> 01:56:42.620
Olivia to say cunt she went back to your village

01:56:42.740 --> 01:56:48.500
Then she went over to a guana girls village and those you that know guana girl knows that she hates that word

01:56:48.940 --> 01:56:50.940
She hates that word

01:56:53.900 --> 01:56:56.140
Could not get her to stop saying it

01:56:57.740 --> 01:57:03.820
Was pissed at me well, she already hated me at that point, but we're past that now we can joke about it now

01:57:03.820 --> 01:57:08.520
See? Ha ha! We can joke about it. But at that point, you know, it was easy to blame it on me, because, you know, yeah...

01:57:08.520 --> 01:57:12.960
Although, actually, I want to say it was Rice Princess that originally got her to say that word in the first place.

01:57:12.960 --> 01:57:14.960
She didn't run your game!

01:57:14.960 --> 01:57:19.580
Hmm. Yeah, because Rice Princess lived in my village, because she didn't have a GameCube, she was poor.

01:57:19.580 --> 01:57:22.080
So...

01:57:22.080 --> 01:57:25.080
Sorry, I shouldn't...

01:57:25.080 --> 01:57:30.980
I don't even know why that was funny. Uh, anyway, I'm just... Good times. Animal Crossing was good times.

01:57:30.980 --> 01:57:33.780
I don't remember, I had the lesbian in my village, too.

01:57:34.780 --> 01:57:36.280
Yeah, there was lesbians.

01:57:36.280 --> 01:57:41.080
There was, I don't remember what she was, but she was a lesbian because she lived in the gym teacher house.

01:57:41.080 --> 01:57:41.580
Mm-hmm.

01:57:41.580 --> 01:57:42.780
And wore sweats all the time.

01:57:42.780 --> 01:57:43.280
Mm-hmm.

01:57:43.280 --> 01:57:45.680
So I put a big rainbow sign outside of her house.

01:57:47.380 --> 01:57:50.980
I remember, you put the big rainbow sign and then you got her to say something like, you know, Big Dyke.

01:57:50.980 --> 01:57:52.280
I don't know, no, I don't remember what it was.

01:57:52.280 --> 01:57:53.280
She said something very...

01:57:53.280 --> 01:57:56.880
We got her to, I've always got her to say Real Gay or something.

01:57:56.880 --> 01:58:00.160
hahaha

01:58:00.160 --> 01:58:02.400
that's great

01:58:02.400 --> 01:58:06.040
we are thinking now I am

01:58:06.040 --> 01:58:10.040
oh cool they're saying in the new animal crossing you can teach outright phrases

01:58:10.040 --> 01:58:16.200
to animals rather than just sentence fragments and so I can teach my village lesbian to say that

01:58:16.200 --> 01:58:17.600
nevermind

01:58:17.600 --> 01:58:19.320
i.e. nevermind

01:58:19.320 --> 01:58:23.940
if I say it somebody's going to YTM and do it so I can't do it

01:58:23.940 --> 01:58:27.940
I fear our listener base all of a sudden.

01:58:27.940 --> 01:58:31.340
Although I do love the idea of like an Orange Lounge Radio village, I don't know how we're

01:58:31.340 --> 01:58:32.340
going to do it.

01:58:32.340 --> 01:58:33.340
I guess it'll just have to be one of our towns.

01:58:33.340 --> 01:58:37.140
We will open up during the show and just let our listeners randomly come in and harass

01:58:37.140 --> 01:58:38.140
us during Orange Lounge.

01:58:38.140 --> 01:58:39.140
But we'll have to recreate ourselves.

01:58:39.140 --> 01:58:40.140
It'll be fun.

01:58:40.140 --> 01:58:42.940
In Animal Crossing form and have our houses.

01:58:42.940 --> 01:58:43.940
Totally.

01:58:43.940 --> 01:58:44.940
Or maybe we'll come to your village.

01:58:44.940 --> 01:58:47.940
That could be the thing is that Orange Lounge Radio, we could party crash your village.

01:58:47.940 --> 01:58:51.100
Get like maybe like once a week, somebody will give us a prank code and we'll go party

01:58:51.100 --> 01:58:53.180
crash in their village and destroy things.

01:59:23.180 --> 01:59:26.780
t-shirt one and I just wrote O-L-R on it was my first emblem but I'm like that's

01:59:26.780 --> 01:59:30.380
stupid and then like when I would get into matches randomly on the internet I

01:59:30.380 --> 01:59:34.420
know nobody's gonna know what that means so now mine is a big orange heart and it

01:59:34.420 --> 01:59:41.340
says in the heart I can't draw I wrote I can't draw mine I actually went and did

01:59:41.340 --> 01:59:46.180
an old logo that I had designed I was gonna do I wanted to get some skull and

01:59:46.180 --> 01:59:50.580
crossbones on there too but I just stuck with Loki yeah

01:59:50.580 --> 01:59:55.940
Mykletof actually took his avatar on DDRFreak and put it through that little site that'll

01:59:55.940 --> 01:59:59.340
show you how to turn your thing into a mari- and he said he spent like an hour and a half

01:59:59.340 --> 02:00:01.480
just drawing it out pixel by pixel.

02:00:01.480 --> 02:00:02.980
That is some dedication there.

02:00:02.980 --> 02:00:03.980
Crazy.

02:00:03.980 --> 02:00:08.660
Did you see the VG cats where they were talking about the logo on the card and it says it's

02:00:08.660 --> 02:00:09.660
a penis?

02:00:09.660 --> 02:00:12.660
No, it's a penis and she goes, I know.

02:00:12.660 --> 02:00:17.220
I'm going to link that to the chatroom.

02:00:17.220 --> 02:00:18.220
Please do.

02:00:18.220 --> 02:00:19.220
That's good.

02:00:19.220 --> 02:00:24.220
So we're going to go to a break, and when we come back from this break, we will reveal the winner of tonight's cage match.

02:00:24.220 --> 02:00:27.220
And if we can't do Skype, I'm going to try and hammer back into Skype.

02:00:27.220 --> 02:00:31.220
If we cannot do Skype, we will figure out something else to do.

02:00:31.220 --> 02:00:34.220
We'll do some Mass Corners lounge where we'll get into the FUs of the week.

02:00:34.220 --> 02:00:36.220
Something.

02:00:36.220 --> 02:00:42.220
Or, you know, maybe we'll just have to rely on our quick wit to fill some show.

02:00:42.220 --> 02:00:44.220
So we'll see what happens.

02:00:44.220 --> 02:00:49.180
In this break, I want to do a little bit of bakwa because I I need some Korean music

02:00:49.180 --> 02:00:53.180
So we're going to do Bequia. We'll be back after this with more Orange Andrea.

02:01:19.180 --> 02:01:21.180
Oh

02:02:49.180 --> 02:02:55.180
Thought I heard you talking so quickly

02:02:56.180 --> 02:03:03.180
I turn on the lights, the cv's and the radio

02:03:03.180 --> 02:03:09.180
Still I can't escape the doses of you

02:03:10.180 --> 02:03:17.180
What is happening to it all, crazy something

02:03:17.180 --> 02:03:23.180
Where is the light that I recognize?

02:03:23.180 --> 02:03:28.180
Gone away, but I won't cry till yesterday

02:03:28.180 --> 02:03:38.180
There's an ordinary world somehow I have to find

02:03:38.180 --> 02:03:46.180
And as I try to make my way to the ordinary world

02:03:46.180 --> 02:03:52.180
I will learn to survive

02:07:16.180 --> 02:07:18.180
Daddy, do you want it?

02:07:18.180 --> 02:07:20.180
Daddy, do you want it?

02:07:20.180 --> 02:07:22.180
Daddy, do you want it?

02:07:22.180 --> 02:07:24.180
Hello?

02:07:24.180 --> 02:07:26.180
Hello, is this thing on? Testing?

02:07:26.180 --> 02:07:28.180
Testing 1-2?

02:07:28.180 --> 02:07:30.180
I'm looking in the index

02:07:30.180 --> 02:07:32.180
but I don't see anything for how to run a radio show.

02:07:32.180 --> 02:07:34.180
Hello?

02:07:34.180 --> 02:07:36.180
I don't understand this.

02:07:36.180 --> 02:07:38.180
Does this thing work?

02:07:38.180 --> 02:07:40.180
This thing reads like stereo instructions.

02:07:40.180 --> 02:07:42.180
Is this on? What the hell?

02:07:42.180 --> 02:07:46.180
Orange Lounge Radio broke down Ghetto Bimani Radio.

02:07:46.180 --> 02:07:48.180
What the f**k?

02:07:50.180 --> 02:07:53.180
You're telling me broke down Ghetto Bimani Radio. We can't get our Skype tour tonight.

02:07:53.180 --> 02:07:57.180
I think it's going to be a wash for Skype tonight because I'm getting the same problem when I get back in there.

02:07:57.180 --> 02:08:02.180
I had one of our listeners try calling us during the break there trying to get in. No worky.

02:08:02.180 --> 02:08:06.180
So I think Skype might be down tonight. We will keep trying. I'm not going to lose hope.

02:08:06.180 --> 02:08:11.180
If we can fit in even one guy. It caught your whooping cough or something.

02:08:11.180 --> 02:08:14.820
If we could fit in even one call before the end of the show, we will do it, but you know,

02:08:14.820 --> 02:08:19.340
this show existed for like a year and a half before we ever had Skype, so we will, of course

02:08:19.340 --> 02:08:23.420
then again the show is only two hours then too, but we will find a way to get through

02:08:23.420 --> 02:08:25.980
this somehow.

02:08:25.980 --> 02:08:30.420
And I realize you guys are seeing us online, I assure you guys, even though we are somehow

02:08:30.420 --> 02:08:34.460
showing us online, we are not getting the pop-up box that shows us we have a call, therefore

02:08:34.460 --> 02:08:36.180
we cannot take your call.

02:08:36.180 --> 02:08:40.100
We thought about patching through Dark Sakura's laptop, but unfortunately that is not an option

02:08:40.100 --> 02:08:43.400
either because we don't have the right cable to plug into our mixing board.

02:08:43.400 --> 02:08:48.200
Sucks to be us, doesn't it? Oh well. Moving on then, let's talk about who won

02:08:48.200 --> 02:08:51.640
tonight's cage match. Don't you want to know who won tonight's cage match?

02:08:51.640 --> 02:08:57.380
Slightly. Oh boy, do you. I wish it could, I wish I could say it was a close call

02:08:57.380 --> 02:09:00.940
tonight, but unfortunately it really wasn't. One song really blew the other

02:09:00.940 --> 02:09:04.680
ones out of the water. Tonight's winner was...

02:09:04.680 --> 02:09:11.000
I told you I can't go wrong if I pick Damon.

02:09:11.000 --> 02:09:12.000
You know why you won?

02:09:12.000 --> 02:09:16.840
Because Roz was rallying the troops in the chat room for you, I think, so that was a

02:09:16.840 --> 02:09:21.000
big part of the reason why I think you got it.

02:09:21.000 --> 02:09:22.000
So good job.

02:09:22.000 --> 02:09:25.780
Blur wins, and we'll go into rotation on our Bomani video game music program, which by

02:09:25.780 --> 02:09:30.520
the way I updated in some capacity this week, and we're going to take a look at the video

02:09:30.520 --> 02:09:34.660
game music portion very soon, but Bomani got a little bit of facelift, and that is all

02:09:34.660 --> 02:09:38.660
all based on your scores that come up in the, for those of you that listen through Live

02:09:38.660 --> 02:09:43.220
365 and not through iTunes, you get little thumbs up and thumbs down icons where you

02:09:43.220 --> 02:09:46.740
can actually, whoa, my, stupid microphone. You get little thumbs up and thumbs down icons

02:09:46.740 --> 02:09:52.260
where you can actually rate the songs as they play. So we actually took out a couple of

02:09:52.260 --> 02:09:56.420
the Romani songs that were very low rated, some of the stuff from Ultramix 2 and some

02:09:56.420 --> 02:10:01.140
of the old, old songs we just kind of flushed out of there and put in some of the good Ultramix

02:10:01.140 --> 02:10:08.300
3 songs and Happy Sky and some other stuff too. I threw in a new Castlevania song for

02:10:08.300 --> 02:10:11.140
good measure just because I was like, this song should be in rotation. Let's not go on

02:10:11.140 --> 02:10:21.060
a new one in there. Enjoy. This microphone is pissing me off. Anyway, I hate this mic.

02:10:21.060 --> 02:10:26.300
That's what we need to use our $25 just to get it on as a replacement mic. We need to

02:10:26.300 --> 02:10:30.180
actually put down some money and get good mics. We should invest it and then in the

02:10:30.180 --> 02:10:36.560
year we could have a good mic. That microphone that you're using there would be about what

02:10:36.560 --> 02:10:41.780
we could afford if we invested the $25. That's one that Angel very kindly donated to us and

02:10:41.780 --> 02:10:44.300
that's... You know, this rear shaft thing's been lasting

02:10:44.300 --> 02:10:48.300
pretty long. Yeah, that one's not bad. I just had to pick

02:10:48.300 --> 02:10:52.860
it up. You know what? I'm about ready to go just

02:10:52.860 --> 02:10:58.380
buy my own top dollar mic. That would be nice. That's a great mic. It

02:10:58.380 --> 02:11:04.620
really is. The one you're using is fabulous, but it costs this much times eight.

02:11:04.620 --> 02:11:09.620
It costs that much times eight. That's how much that costs, according to Angel.

02:11:09.620 --> 02:11:19.620
So, yeah. And I see some people in the room bitching about my microphone's suggestion

02:11:19.620 --> 02:11:23.220
to turn up the mixing board's mic boost until the microphone works. Unfortunately, that

02:11:23.220 --> 02:11:27.540
doesn't work right, because the problem with this microphone is it's what we call, I think

02:11:27.540 --> 02:11:32.580
they call it unidirectional, which means it only works if the microphone is pointing in

02:11:32.580 --> 02:11:36.060
one particular direction. And it's really good for reporters who are trying to interview

02:11:36.060 --> 02:11:40.420
someone who don't want to get all that background noise. But the problem is, usually what you

02:11:40.420 --> 02:11:44.700
get is a cardio-shaped microphone, which is like a heart-shaped audio pattern, or you

02:11:44.700 --> 02:11:49.640
have a, I think, omni-directional microphone, which is, you can pick up sound in all directions.

02:11:49.640 --> 02:11:53.500
And Dark Soccer and Loki have omni-directional microphones, so no matter which way they're

02:11:53.500 --> 02:11:57.060
holding the microphone, it's picking up their sound. Unfortunately, with this microphone,

02:11:57.060 --> 02:12:02.880
If I turn it just a little bit too far one direction, you suddenly lose the voice and

02:12:02.880 --> 02:12:04.120
you don't hear me as well.

02:12:04.120 --> 02:12:08.280
So I have to talk specifically into one part of this microphone or it doesn't work.

02:12:08.280 --> 02:12:11.260
And the problem is that I'm not necessarily used to this microphone, so that's why you

02:12:11.260 --> 02:12:12.840
get a lot of weird sound out of this.

02:12:12.840 --> 02:12:13.840
So go figure.

02:12:13.840 --> 02:12:18.480
You still sound more normal than I do.

02:12:18.480 --> 02:12:19.480
To some extent.

02:12:19.480 --> 02:12:23.080
And then people are saying in the chat room, oh, my headset mic only cost me $8.

02:12:23.080 --> 02:12:27.080
The problem is that we used to use those headsets in the early, early days.

02:12:27.080 --> 02:12:31.080
Hey, and the headsets that I bought were expensive.

02:12:31.080 --> 02:12:34.080
And they were call center headsets.

02:12:34.080 --> 02:12:36.080
Yeah, and the problem is they kind of sounded like call center.

02:12:36.080 --> 02:12:38.080
They didn't, they were good. They worked at a time.

02:12:38.080 --> 02:12:39.080
They were free.

02:12:39.080 --> 02:12:42.080
But remember that very, very, very first mic we had?

02:12:42.080 --> 02:12:43.080
It was the guest microphone.

02:12:43.080 --> 02:12:45.080
It was this little tiny $10 microphone

02:12:45.080 --> 02:12:47.080
that sounded like you were talking out of two Dixie cups and a string.

02:12:47.080 --> 02:12:48.080
Yeah.

02:12:48.080 --> 02:12:49.080
I wish I had.

02:12:49.080 --> 02:12:51.080
What happened to the boom mic?

02:12:51.080 --> 02:12:52.080
The boom mic?

02:12:52.080 --> 02:12:53.080
We had the big...

02:12:53.080 --> 02:12:56.080
Oh, the boom mic! That's at Loki's house.

02:12:56.080 --> 02:12:57.080
Yeah, it's still my house.

02:12:57.080 --> 02:13:01.080
Yeah, the boom mic was our idea, because we used to have a lot of sidebar conversations.

02:13:01.080 --> 02:13:06.080
Because in the old place, in the old studio, we would have like ten people that could fit in the studio.

02:13:06.080 --> 02:13:08.080
It was an ambient mic.

02:13:08.080 --> 02:13:14.080
Yeah, and the boom mic was supposed to pick up sidebar conversations, and it was to kind of encourage people to shut the eff up while we're trying to do a show.

02:13:14.080 --> 02:13:18.080
Well, it was supposed to be so you could hear people yelling in the background.

02:13:18.080 --> 02:13:20.080
Oh, that too.

02:13:20.080 --> 02:13:22.400
And it worked pretty good for what we had.

02:13:22.400 --> 02:13:24.880
You know, it worked okay. It was kind of hit and miss.

02:13:24.880 --> 02:13:28.160
It was hidden, see, so no one knew what it was so they couldn't talk into it.

02:13:28.160 --> 02:13:30.720
Exactly. It was good.

02:13:30.720 --> 02:13:32.320
All right, um...

02:13:32.320 --> 02:13:36.000
I think what we'll do now, because I'm feeling a little angsty about the Skypline not working,

02:13:36.000 --> 02:13:40.960
is I think now would be a very good time for us to, uh, get into the FUs of the week.

02:13:40.960 --> 02:13:43.040
I don't know. Do you think that's a good idea, DarkSakura?

02:13:43.040 --> 02:13:45.840
Because I know I'm certainly feeling the angst. I don't know about you.

02:13:45.840 --> 02:13:46.960
Completely agree.

02:13:46.960 --> 02:13:47.920
Okay.

02:13:47.920 --> 02:13:49.640
and uh...

02:13:49.640 --> 02:13:52.660
where it's not the f he's the week and uh... dark soccer why is it we do the

02:13:52.660 --> 02:13:56.040
f he's the week by the way you guys can send them now dark soccer why is that we

02:13:56.040 --> 02:14:03.040
do the f he's the week every single week

02:14:09.960 --> 02:14:11.960
i haven't heard that a while

02:14:11.960 --> 02:14:16.400
the f he goes toward whatever the disease of the week is

02:14:16.400 --> 02:14:21.320
Apparently I went from a cold, to a sinus infection, to bronchitis, to pneumonia, to

02:14:21.320 --> 02:14:26.560
whipping cough, and I kind of miss knowing what my voice sounds like other than listening

02:14:26.560 --> 02:14:29.880
to our old bumpers on the station.

02:14:29.880 --> 02:14:35.480
And F.U. took me getting lotion sick from playing We Love Katamari.

02:14:35.480 --> 02:14:39.880
And F.U. goes from me not having any more time off for the rest of the year, and also

02:14:39.880 --> 02:14:43.560
having to put off my trip to London until 2007.

02:14:43.560 --> 02:14:48.560
And also to whoever that was that double parked in your parking lot, Rob, because they suck.

02:14:48.560 --> 02:14:50.560
They suck quite a bit!

02:14:50.560 --> 02:14:54.560
And also if you two are not having any hot tea right now.

02:14:54.560 --> 02:14:57.560
Good.

02:14:57.560 --> 02:15:01.560
Let's go over to Loki and see where his angst is.

02:15:01.560 --> 02:15:05.560
My angst is with games being boring.

02:15:05.560 --> 02:15:12.560
Like for example, Shadow Colossus. I'm getting quite bored with that game really quick.

02:15:12.560 --> 02:15:14.560
So, yeah, I have to sell that back now.

02:15:14.560 --> 02:15:18.560
Fuck you, there's Microsoft for not selling out quite enough Xbox 360s.

02:15:18.560 --> 02:15:20.560
Yeah, and they want to drive a pipe. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

02:15:20.560 --> 02:15:23.560
You're not going to do that by really cryptic commercials.

02:15:23.560 --> 02:15:26.560
You need a commercial that screams, wow, this is kickass.

02:15:26.560 --> 02:15:28.560
You know, you got to get it.

02:15:28.560 --> 02:15:32.560
Watching people throw water balloons does not scream, wow, this is kickass.

02:15:32.560 --> 02:15:34.560
Or watching people jump rope, no, that is not kickass.

02:15:34.560 --> 02:15:36.560
That tells me, go outside.

02:15:36.560 --> 02:15:38.560
That's what that says.

02:15:38.560 --> 02:15:41.560
So, you might be marketing that to the wrong people.

02:15:41.560 --> 02:15:59.560
I didn't have a problem today. I never have a problem with McDonald's and my orders.

02:15:59.560 --> 02:16:04.560
Well, they couldn't figure out how to run an ATM card, apparently, because they just did it in the machine, kind of like,

02:16:04.560 --> 02:16:06.560
and went,

02:16:06.560 --> 02:16:08.560
couldn't figure it out, so.

02:16:08.560 --> 02:16:10.560
I'd do it myself.

02:16:10.560 --> 02:16:13.560
I have tea bags if you want some hot tea.

02:16:13.560 --> 02:16:14.560
You sure?

02:16:14.560 --> 02:16:15.560
I want my herbs from home.

02:16:15.560 --> 02:16:16.560
Peppermint.

02:16:16.560 --> 02:16:18.560
I only have shitty Lipton, sorry.

02:16:18.560 --> 02:16:20.560
I have shitty Lipton green tea, too.

02:16:20.560 --> 02:16:24.560
I've been making Peppermint and White Willow tea.

02:16:24.560 --> 02:16:25.560
Oh, that sounds good.

02:16:25.560 --> 02:16:26.560
White Willow is nasty shit.

02:16:26.560 --> 02:16:28.560
Egyptian licorice is my favorite, absolutely.

02:16:28.560 --> 02:16:35.560
I'm going to be online playing Mario Kart DS after this show, briefly, between the show and the podcast.

02:16:35.560 --> 02:16:37.560
You should get some friend codes.

02:16:37.560 --> 02:16:41.560
I have friend codes, but I could never catch anyone online.

02:16:41.560 --> 02:16:44.560
So just let them know and give them fair warning.

02:16:45.560 --> 02:16:46.560
Alright, my turn.

02:16:50.560 --> 02:16:55.560
If you do the fact that I have to go back to work tomorrow after four days of not having to work,

02:16:55.560 --> 02:16:58.560
because you kind of get used to not working and then you have to go back to work.

02:16:58.560 --> 02:17:02.060
Tomorrow's going to kind of be a busy day, too, just because it's like one of those things,

02:17:02.060 --> 02:17:06.560
you know, especially when you're kind of in the role that I play at my organization,

02:17:06.560 --> 02:17:08.560
it's kind of like I've got to find my groove.

02:17:08.560 --> 02:17:11.060
Rob's got to get his groove back, like Stella.

02:17:11.060 --> 02:17:15.560
I've got to get my groove back, and it's not something that's going to click at 8 o'clock in the morning tomorrow,

02:17:15.560 --> 02:17:17.560
so I'm going to be very groggy and bitchy tomorrow.

02:17:17.560 --> 02:17:21.060
As for the fact that I way overslept this weekend, I mean, seriously,

02:17:21.060 --> 02:17:24.560
I've been sleeping, like, at least 10 hours a night every night this week,

02:17:24.560 --> 02:17:28.940
that is not good for me but it feels so good I'm so relaxed now so maybe I

02:17:28.940 --> 02:17:32.820
needed it because ten hours of sleep a night is much better than the like four

02:17:32.820 --> 02:17:36.660
and six hours a night I was getting previously so I certainly paid for it

02:17:36.660 --> 02:17:41.060
this break I think if I could have just hibernated for the past four days it

02:17:41.060 --> 02:17:48.420
would have been great an F you to the fact that I was an F you to the fact

02:17:48.420 --> 02:17:52.220
that I couldn't get an Xbox 360 even if I wanted one and an F you to the fact

02:17:52.220 --> 02:17:56.540
that a lot of video games are $50, like the new ones. Like, $50 is a lot of money. $60.

02:17:56.540 --> 02:18:00.540
Well, yeah, yeah, the Xbox 360 is like $60, but even like, you know, current-gen platforms

02:18:00.540 --> 02:18:05.460
are $50. Sometimes, if you're lucky, $30 or $40, but Dragon Quest VIII sent me back $50,

02:18:05.460 --> 02:18:09.780
so it's kinda like, boy oh boy, I better get $100 of playtime out of that game or something

02:18:09.780 --> 02:18:15.060
to make it worth it. Otherwise, I'm gonna be pissed. Yeah. So, F you do expensive things.

02:18:15.060 --> 02:18:21.780
That's not fun. Alright, let's go to the chatroom FUs, of which I'm sure there are plenty this

02:18:21.780 --> 02:18:29.500
week. Let's see what's going on there. Ah, let's see. Rini wants to give a big, huge F.U. to

02:18:29.500 --> 02:18:34.200
Best Buy at McDonald's for making me gather $21, Best Buy dollars, and when I

02:18:34.200 --> 02:18:39.220
finally get to use them on UltraMix 3, the website, lolatloki, the damn game

02:18:39.220 --> 02:18:43.500
gets on backorder, so I had to buy at full price at GameStop and get a refund.

02:18:43.500 --> 02:18:47.980
Another F.U. to the manager at a nearby EB Games, where I was considering buying

02:18:47.980 --> 02:18:53.300
UltraMix3 when he hangs up because he thinks I'm a rival manager, letting him know that the game is out already.

02:18:53.300 --> 02:18:54.800
What?

02:18:54.800 --> 02:18:59.600
And my last F.U. to a Wasp that took four hits with a large towel to take down.

02:19:02.600 --> 02:19:05.100
My next F.U. comes from Sephiroth1215.

02:19:05.100 --> 02:19:08.200
F.U. to my teacher giving work over Thanksgiving.

02:19:08.200 --> 02:19:11.740
Oh, remember? Remember back in the day when we were in high school,

02:19:11.740 --> 02:19:14.580
and those bitches would give us homework over like Christmas break?

02:19:14.580 --> 02:19:17.080
It's like, read this book!

02:19:17.080 --> 02:19:19.080
I really enjoyed reading books.

02:19:19.080 --> 02:19:23.080
I enjoyed reading books too, but not the crap that our teachers assigned us.

02:19:23.080 --> 02:19:25.080
I liked reading contemporary stuff.

02:19:25.080 --> 02:19:31.080
And I remember to this day the book I hated that I had to read in high school was Dandelion Wine.

02:19:31.080 --> 02:19:33.080
Hated that book.

02:19:33.080 --> 02:19:35.080
It was so stupid.

02:19:35.080 --> 02:19:36.080
That book?

02:19:36.080 --> 02:19:38.080
Dandelion Wine is what it was called.

02:19:38.080 --> 02:19:39.080
You know what I was reading?

02:19:39.080 --> 02:19:40.080
No.

02:19:40.080 --> 02:19:41.080
The Inferno.

02:19:41.080 --> 02:19:42.080
That's cool.

02:19:42.080 --> 02:19:44.080
And The Odyssey.

02:19:44.080 --> 02:19:46.080
They did give us some good choices.

02:19:46.080 --> 02:19:50.080
I did a book report on the Bible.

02:19:50.080 --> 02:19:52.080
For real?

02:19:52.080 --> 02:19:54.080
They let you do that in school?

02:19:54.080 --> 02:19:57.080
They had no choice. I wrote my book report.

02:19:57.080 --> 02:19:58.080
Look at the book!

02:19:58.080 --> 02:20:00.080
You do stink.

02:20:00.080 --> 02:20:02.080
What was the book?

02:20:02.080 --> 02:20:04.080
1984, but our class didn't do that one.

02:20:04.080 --> 02:20:06.080
We did Brave New World, which was just as weird.

02:20:06.080 --> 02:20:08.080
You know, we did Catcher in the Rye, which was cool.

02:20:08.080 --> 02:20:10.080
I enjoyed doing Catcher in the Rye.

02:20:10.080 --> 02:20:12.080
I hated the Grapes of Wrath.

02:20:12.080 --> 02:20:15.080
Fuck the Grapes of Wrath. Oh my god, we ought to do that one too.

02:20:15.080 --> 02:20:18.120
Anyway, Sephiroth1215 also says,

02:20:18.120 --> 02:20:20.880
and F.U. to Tecmo for pushing back DOA4

02:20:20.880 --> 02:20:23.720
because I won another 360 game that is actually good.

02:20:23.720 --> 02:20:25.320
Oh, and Sephiroth1215 would like to say,

02:20:25.320 --> 02:20:27.280
he's actually in college, not high school.

02:20:30.280 --> 02:20:32.720
Look at Mike, same thing with college, seriously.

02:20:36.040 --> 02:20:38.040
Darkknight says, F.U. to Black Friday,

02:20:38.040 --> 02:20:40.400
F.U. to losing my stylus, I had to buy a new one,

02:20:40.400 --> 02:20:42.720
F.U. to being single for 18 years.

02:20:42.720 --> 02:20:48.720
I would buy him a horn. Seriously, I mean, that's why I'm kidding. Hold on to it!

02:20:48.720 --> 02:20:51.720
My stylus got eaten by my couch.

02:20:51.720 --> 02:20:54.720
I have a spare.

02:20:54.720 --> 02:20:58.720
Dan bought me a silver one that matches my DS.

02:20:58.720 --> 02:21:02.720
Um...

02:21:02.720 --> 02:21:07.720
You know you can buy those styluses in, like, the little color packs so you can have, like, a purple stylus?

02:21:07.720 --> 02:21:13.720
We have the two packs. We have the black one, the blue one, and the silver one.

02:21:13.720 --> 02:21:14.720
Sorry, I have the silver one.

02:21:14.720 --> 02:21:15.720
I want a purple one.

02:21:17.720 --> 02:21:19.720
God, I hate you, microphone. Purple's cool.

02:21:20.720 --> 02:21:21.720
Moving on.

02:21:21.720 --> 02:21:23.720
I'm back used to the microphone.

02:21:23.720 --> 02:21:24.720
Seriously.

02:21:24.720 --> 02:21:28.720
Roz wants to say an F.U. to Graham Coxon, that sexy bitch,

02:21:28.720 --> 02:21:33.720
delayed his new album release from Fall 2005 to March 16th, 2006.

02:21:33.720 --> 02:21:35.720
Nice way to work in that plug, by the way.

02:21:35.720 --> 02:21:41.320
Ron Chan says F you to people that drop out of races on Mario Kart DS. Take your beatings like a man

02:21:42.600 --> 02:21:49.300
Neo dude zero says F you to crappy link says USB internet adapters. I've been in and out of both show and chat all night

02:21:51.480 --> 02:21:55.460
Vander C says F you to Jamie for slapping me with the trout. I don't like trout

02:21:57.680 --> 02:21:59.680
Tell him to stay tuned for my response

02:21:59.680 --> 02:22:06.680
You need to slap him with a grilled salmon, or slap him with a chili bath.

02:22:06.680 --> 02:22:08.680
Marco is for trout.

02:22:08.680 --> 02:22:09.680
I know.

02:22:09.680 --> 02:22:17.680
Tomo-kun says, fuck me neglecting this show and the podcast for weeks upon weeks upon weeks.

02:22:17.680 --> 02:22:23.680
I agree. F you. Oh, and fuck you whoever sends me the same piece of spam.

02:22:23.680 --> 02:22:30.160
PopeHanda21 says F you to my ex boyfriend for being emo and F you to the world's ugliest

02:22:30.160 --> 02:22:32.160
dog.

02:22:32.160 --> 02:22:34.640
Sakurina says F you to stupid babies on the bus.

02:22:34.640 --> 02:22:38.640
The fucking mom decides to bring her baby in a stroller on the busiest bus in town filled

02:22:38.640 --> 02:22:43.520
with tons of students yet she bitches about us nearly killing her baby with our taking

02:22:43.520 --> 02:22:44.520
space.

02:22:44.520 --> 02:22:47.200
Yeah well get a fucking babysitter bitch you're the one who's stupid enough to bring your

02:22:47.200 --> 02:22:50.240
baby on a bus which is occupied by students headed to school.

02:22:50.240 --> 02:22:51.240
Fuck you.

02:22:51.240 --> 02:22:57.280
ColorOfSakura says, F you to not getting enough hours at work, F you to Mario Kart DS's lack

02:22:57.280 --> 02:23:03.880
of good wifi interface, F you to the Xbox 360, F you to sickness, F you to getting my

02:23:03.880 --> 02:23:08.800
2DX controller in the mail and it being broken.

02:23:08.800 --> 02:23:12.360
Legend of Zaku says, F you to not investing $400 earlier this year, it's like getting

02:23:12.360 --> 02:23:17.120
Xbox 360 for me to sell on eBay now, F you to Sake not being as strong as I thought it

02:23:17.120 --> 02:23:21.320
would be. F you to fucking ants that invaded my box of Rice-A-Roni, thus

02:23:21.320 --> 02:23:26.360
forcing me to ditch that box and use up another... Oh, to be in college again. F you

02:23:26.360 --> 02:23:30.260
to all other game stores for trying to offer me pennies for Madden 06 and NBA

02:23:30.260 --> 02:23:34.880
Live 06. Lucky me, I knew this place around my way that gave me $50 for both

02:23:34.880 --> 02:23:40.760
of them. And Nintendo Maniac would like to say... Oh, Nintendo Maniac 64 says F you

02:23:40.760 --> 02:23:43.880
to the weather for there being lots of snow and a possible snow day on

02:23:43.880 --> 02:23:48.520
Thanksgiving week. FU to my computer for locking up a few minutes ago, preventing me from not

02:23:48.520 --> 02:23:54.760
knowing its FU time. FU to myself for putting a knot in my last FU when it was supposed

02:23:54.760 --> 02:23:59.120
to be there. What? It wasn't supposed to be there. FU to myself for building a DS Lego

02:23:59.120 --> 02:24:04.520
charging deck which took up my charger and I had to partially disassemble it to get my

02:24:04.520 --> 02:24:10.280
charger out so I could play, uh, I keep wanting to say Mortal Kombat, Mario Kart DS without

02:24:10.280 --> 02:24:17.280
my DS's battery dying.

02:24:40.280 --> 02:24:43.280
But it works good! Works good for charging.

02:24:45.280 --> 02:24:49.280
Can you use hot glue and you put it together and it'll never fall apart again?

02:24:49.280 --> 02:24:56.280
Yeah, and then you'll never be able to get that stupid charger thing out of there, because you basically, you hold the wire in place with Legos or something underneath it.

02:24:56.280 --> 02:24:57.280
Yeah.

02:24:57.280 --> 02:24:58.280
Not fun.

02:24:58.280 --> 02:25:00.280
It's stuck in there pretty good.

02:25:00.280 --> 02:25:03.280
That's cool though. I like that DS charging station. It was a good idea.

02:25:03.280 --> 02:25:08.780
I'll have to find... I have the specs on my computer still.

02:25:08.780 --> 02:25:12.780
Post those. It was fun. Good times.

02:25:12.780 --> 02:25:16.780
Alright, I think what we're going to do is we're going to go to a break,

02:25:16.780 --> 02:25:21.280
and when we come back we might do some Ask Orange Lounge if the Skype line's not working,

02:25:21.280 --> 02:25:25.780
and some other stories, whatever tickles our fancy when we come back after this break.

02:25:25.780 --> 02:25:29.780
And in this break, more Bhumani potpourri, because we can.

02:25:29.780 --> 02:25:32.780
And we'll start it off with an old school Beatmania song.

02:25:32.780 --> 02:25:35.500
We're going to do Total Recall.

02:25:35.500 --> 02:25:38.140
We'll be back with more Orange Lounge Radio right after this.

02:26:38.140 --> 02:27:06.140
I know you've worked across the street and you've made it to breakfast or a picnic

02:27:06.140 --> 02:27:08.780
Someday that will mean I'm thinking we'll do something more

02:27:08.780 --> 02:27:12.140
I hide behind my magazine, then I see a world come by

02:27:12.140 --> 02:27:15.900
I'm not ready to be seen, I'll just stick right here and then I'll be fine

02:27:28.460 --> 02:27:34.780
I'll take advantage of the feeling in me lately

02:27:34.780 --> 02:27:36.780
I need my time

02:27:37.780 --> 02:27:41.780
Yeah, I don't want you to leave me

02:27:41.780 --> 02:27:54.780
Can't take a, can't take a home Can't take a home, can't take a home

02:30:24.780 --> 02:30:31.780
Let's go right to later

02:30:31.780 --> 02:30:34.780
Yeah, you're Captain Jack

02:30:34.780 --> 02:30:37.780
Bring me back to Rainbow Track

02:30:37.780 --> 02:30:40.780
Give me blood in my hand

02:30:40.780 --> 02:30:43.780
I wanna be your shooting man

02:30:43.780 --> 02:30:44.780
I wanna be your shooting man

02:30:44.780 --> 02:30:47.780
I wanna be your shooting man

02:30:47.780 --> 02:30:49.780
I wanna be your shooting man

02:30:49.780 --> 02:30:52.780
Give me a gun in my hand

02:30:52.780 --> 02:30:55.780
I wanna be your shooting man

02:30:55.780 --> 02:30:57.780
Left by left

02:30:57.780 --> 02:31:00.780
The military staff

02:31:00.780 --> 02:31:03.780
The airborne craft

02:31:03.780 --> 02:31:06.780
The summoning is the best

02:31:06.780 --> 02:31:09.780
Go left or right, don't pick up the gun

02:31:09.780 --> 02:31:12.780
Go left or right, go left

02:31:12.780 --> 02:31:14.780
Go left or right, don't pick up the gun

02:31:14.780 --> 02:31:17.780
Go left or right, go left

02:31:47.780 --> 02:31:58.500
Go left, go right, go figure set, go left, go right, go left.

02:31:58.500 --> 02:32:04.700
Gaming radio, so uncensored that even Tom Brokaw could get a job with us.

02:32:04.700 --> 02:32:06.900
Uh, Mooch, uh, Moochawky.

02:32:06.900 --> 02:32:07.900
Orange Lounge Radio.

02:32:07.900 --> 02:32:08.900
Tag's gone.

02:32:08.900 --> 02:32:15.820
Back, boys and girls, with more Orange Lounge Radio, and a broke-ass Skype line, so we have

02:32:15.820 --> 02:32:17.900
No callers tonight.

02:32:17.900 --> 02:32:21.860
God, thank God we didn't have any interviews or anything scheduled tonight. Thank God.

02:32:21.860 --> 02:32:23.940
We'd be really screwed.

02:32:23.940 --> 02:32:28.380
Um, so, sorry guys, we can't, uh, get you guys in on the Skype line, so, um, we're not gonna be

02:32:28.380 --> 02:32:32.380
able to do, um, some calls tonight. We'll try one more time before the end of show, although

02:32:32.380 --> 02:32:34.980
I somehow highly doubt it's gonna work.

02:32:34.980 --> 02:32:38.640
And, apologize to those of you guys that were waiting to call in, but you know what?

02:32:38.640 --> 02:32:41.580
Shit happens.

02:32:41.580 --> 02:32:47.100
Of course, next week we'll be back with another episode of Orange Launch Radio Live, and all

02:32:47.100 --> 02:32:48.100
of us will be here.

02:32:48.100 --> 02:32:50.700
Maybe we'll have some special guests next week, I don't know.

02:32:50.700 --> 02:32:54.380
We've got to talk some of our buddies into coming on over to the show.

02:32:54.380 --> 02:32:58.660
Don't forget, we also have, excuse me, other live programming on Orange Launch Radio all

02:32:58.660 --> 02:32:59.660
week long.

02:32:59.660 --> 02:33:07.380
Monday nights, X-to-Verse Case of the Mondays, which airs at 7 o'clock.

02:33:07.380 --> 02:33:10.740
It's not really a show about gaming, although he'll talk about games once in a while.

02:33:10.740 --> 02:33:15.180
It's more of one of those things like, extra fresh your buddy, and he'll tell you the answer

02:33:15.180 --> 02:33:16.180
to something straight up.

02:33:16.180 --> 02:33:20.500
He will just, you know, he doesn't hold back, and it's definitely an R-rated show.

02:33:20.500 --> 02:33:23.020
And he'll say lots of dirty words in succession.

02:33:23.020 --> 02:33:24.020
He will.

02:33:24.020 --> 02:33:25.020
But it's funny.

02:33:25.020 --> 02:33:26.020
It's a good time, so tune in to that.

02:33:26.020 --> 02:33:28.260
Tuesday nights on the station, our very own Dark Sakura.

02:33:28.260 --> 02:33:31.140
Every other Tuesday night on the station, Dark Sakura is with us with...

02:33:31.140 --> 02:33:33.380
Oh, that's the volume.

02:33:33.380 --> 02:33:34.380
Sorry.

02:33:34.380 --> 02:33:39.060
That's the volume which I'm doing every other Tuesday until the end of the semester, and

02:33:39.060 --> 02:33:46.180
I'll be back on regularly. It's a musical request show. I play whatever. Just tune in.

02:33:46.180 --> 02:33:50.420
Wednesday nights on the station, the Rob Roberts show, which is also on at 7 o'clock Pacific

02:33:50.420 --> 02:33:55.980
time. And same sort of deal, I do take requests, but that's not really the concept of my show.

02:33:55.980 --> 02:33:59.820
I just play whatever the hell I feel like. And I also talk about geek stuff. I'll find

02:33:59.820 --> 02:34:03.460
some geek articles on the web and kind of give you my opinion on them. I'm kind of like

02:34:03.460 --> 02:34:14.100
that way, except not a fat drug addict, basically. Also, on Orange Launch Radio, we may have

02:34:14.100 --> 02:34:17.740
some new shows coming soon. We're looking at expanding the station in the future. It

02:34:17.740 --> 02:34:22.100
may happen, may not, we don't know. Very likely, though, that you're going to see some exciting

02:34:22.100 --> 02:34:26.340
stuff in the future at Orange Launch Radio. Stay tuned. Because you'll notice, you know,

02:34:26.340 --> 02:34:29.740
we've got Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, we don't, you know, we've got a couple of days we could

02:34:29.740 --> 02:34:34.880
to do some more other stuff with, so we will see what happens. Moving on. Shall we do some

02:34:34.880 --> 02:34:38.880
Ask Orange Lounge, boys and girls? Alright, I got the thumbs up from Dark Sakura, so here

02:34:38.880 --> 02:34:51.160
we go! It would help to have the volume up when I bring in the theme music, huh? Let's

02:34:51.160 --> 02:34:56.880
Ask Orange Lounge, some stupid question. What will we find out this week on Orange Lounge

02:34:56.880 --> 02:35:02.720
radio will we find out why this microphone is broken because I'm about to

02:35:02.720 --> 02:35:09.880
throw it through a window if it doesn't cooperate yeah apparently all they heard

02:35:09.880 --> 02:35:16.200
was geek articles and then fat drug addict no what I said is geek articles

02:35:16.200 --> 02:35:20.360
and I'm kind of like a one-man Rush Limbaugh because I give my opinions on

02:35:20.360 --> 02:35:26.200
them except I'm not a fat drug addict that was the correct thing that I said

02:35:27.520 --> 02:35:33.320
Sakurina wants to know does sky like Rizlim the remix I believe I believe

02:35:33.320 --> 02:35:38.920
that's a song in night style right that's over in the ninth style let me

02:35:38.920 --> 02:35:42.520
see if I can get a little clip here of the Rizlim remix Dark Sakura is over

02:35:42.520 --> 02:35:46.680
there in the corner gagging I take it you do not like the Rizlim remix it could

02:35:46.680 --> 02:35:50.680
It could just be a lung cookie, but it sort of made my stomach turn.

02:35:50.680 --> 02:35:54.680
Hold on, let me see if we can get a little clip here of the Rizlin remix.

02:35:54.680 --> 02:35:59.680
Yeah, that crap.

02:35:59.680 --> 02:36:03.680
I like the part that doesn't have the singing in it. Like, this is cool.

02:36:03.680 --> 02:36:07.680
The bend one again in the middle.

02:36:07.680 --> 02:36:10.680
I like the part where it ends.

02:36:10.680 --> 02:36:14.680
I don't know, I like that kind of stuff. It just doesn't work.

02:36:14.680 --> 02:36:17.880
It's okay. It's okay.

02:36:17.880 --> 02:36:24.180
I prefer the original. I definitely prefer the original. But it's okay. I don't hate it. I don't despise it like I suck at this.

02:36:24.180 --> 02:36:26.880
Still gotta work on the other remix.

02:36:26.880 --> 02:36:33.180
Are you gonna tell us about the samples thing? Hold on, hold on. After Asgore's launch, we're gonna do it.

02:36:33.180 --> 02:36:41.480
Does anyone know the approximate cost of a 2DX 9th style machine and if they are still in production?

02:36:41.480 --> 02:36:43.480
At least $7,000.

02:37:11.480 --> 02:37:17.480
Because he's heard me say it. And you know, Mikletov spends the weekend here sometimes, and we'll both be playing it, and he's like,

02:37:17.480 --> 02:37:24.480
What's that? And we say, It's 2DX. So he knows it. Because he's seen it, he just sucks at it. Just teasing.

02:37:24.480 --> 02:37:29.480
He is a pro at, uh, at Taeko no Tatsujin.

02:37:29.480 --> 02:37:33.480
He is actually very good at Taeko no Tatsujin.

02:37:33.480 --> 02:37:39.480
Uh, let's see, moving on. Tomo-kun wants to know, How about that show, The Boondocks?

02:37:39.480 --> 02:37:41.480
I've never seen this show.

02:37:41.480 --> 02:37:45.480
I remember reading the comics in my funny papers.

02:37:45.480 --> 02:37:47.480
Not interested in watching this show.

02:37:47.480 --> 02:37:52.480
There is a funny show I did hear about and I want to see it. It's supposed to be late tonight is when it's on.

02:37:52.480 --> 02:37:59.480
MTV2. It's called Wonder Shosen. It's like an adult version of Sesame Street.

02:37:59.480 --> 02:38:01.480
That sounds awesome.

02:38:01.480 --> 02:38:03.480
MTV2. It's late at night.

02:38:03.480 --> 02:38:05.480
Are Bert and Ernie really gay in this one?

02:38:05.480 --> 02:38:10.480
No, they have, like, different characters, but they have one. It's, uh, what is it, uh...

02:38:10.480 --> 02:38:13.480
D-O-G-Y-N is one of the, uh...

02:38:13.480 --> 02:38:16.480
You know, like, dog O-B-G-Y-N.

02:38:16.480 --> 02:38:19.480
And then, uh, they also have, um, like, some weird ones.

02:38:19.480 --> 02:38:24.480
There's one, like, they were talking about the letter N, and nobody liked the letter N, so N left.

02:38:24.480 --> 02:38:27.480
Then they had to find the letter S to track down the letter N.

02:38:27.480 --> 02:38:33.480
And instead of tracking, uh, N down, it ended up having sex with N and had babies and stuff.

02:38:33.480 --> 02:38:38.120
stuff. There's this weird shit. There's another one where they're playing Rock, Paper, Scissor

02:38:38.120 --> 02:38:43.200
with God, and just really strange shit. But it sounded funny.

02:38:43.200 --> 02:38:50.200
Interesting. I guess. I haven't been interested in a lot of television lately, except my crappy

02:38:55.120 --> 02:39:01.660
reality shows that I watch once in a while. Ron Chan wants to know, who is your favorite

02:39:01.660 --> 02:39:07.660
Who's your favorite character in the Super Mario Bros. series?

02:39:07.660 --> 02:39:11.660
Who's your favorite character in the Super Mario Bros. series?

02:39:11.660 --> 02:39:15.660
Ummm...

02:39:15.660 --> 02:39:17.660
I don't know.

02:39:17.660 --> 02:39:22.660
I'd say Princess Peach, because Peach is the winner! She's such an arrogant little fuck, I like her.

02:39:22.660 --> 02:39:27.660
Big Boo! Big Boo! Big Boo is pretty awesome. You, Loki?

02:39:27.660 --> 02:39:28.660
Geno.

02:39:28.660 --> 02:39:29.660
Who?

02:39:29.660 --> 02:39:30.660
Geno.

02:39:30.660 --> 02:39:32.060
He's from Super Mario RPG.

02:39:32.060 --> 02:39:33.580
Oh god.

02:39:33.580 --> 02:39:36.780
Wow, that's obscure.

02:39:36.780 --> 02:39:42.220
Uh, more questions.

02:39:42.220 --> 02:39:47.260
Reemie asks the following, consider the following.

02:39:47.260 --> 02:39:52.660
Medical science advances to the point where a device can seal wounds on the spot.

02:39:52.660 --> 02:39:53.740
Problem.

02:39:53.740 --> 02:39:59.940
Your friends use said technology to seal your ass shut as a practical joke.

02:39:59.940 --> 02:40:00.940
What do you do?

02:40:00.940 --> 02:40:05.300
Go on jackass.

02:40:05.300 --> 02:40:06.300
Reveal a ban.

02:40:06.300 --> 02:40:07.300
Fire it open.

02:40:07.300 --> 02:40:10.540
I think you would die because your colon would explode.

02:40:10.540 --> 02:40:12.180
Fire it open!

02:40:12.180 --> 02:40:15.460
Or you would go to the hospital and I don't know, have them cut it open.

02:40:15.460 --> 02:40:18.580
You know, yeah, I would think if the medical science is far enough along where they could

02:40:18.580 --> 02:40:21.820
seal your ass shut magically they could unseal it magically.

02:40:21.820 --> 02:40:27.020
If it ain't broke, I can't fix it.

02:40:27.020 --> 02:40:31.580
And what are some pretty underrated songs on DDR? Oh, a real question. That's good to know.

02:40:31.580 --> 02:40:35.820
What are some pretty underrated songs on DDR?

02:40:35.820 --> 02:40:39.820
Moving On. Someone's knocking on the door. No, that's me. I'm tapping on the table.

02:40:39.820 --> 02:40:42.820
Uh, Moving On from DDR 5th Mix.

02:40:42.820 --> 02:40:46.820
I like that song. That's a cool song. What else?

02:40:46.820 --> 02:40:53.820
you think of any Dark Sakura? Underrated songs in DDR. That's really easy, because I always

02:40:54.140 --> 02:40:57.700
said Love That Feelin' was underrated. Oh, because a lot of people hate on Love That

02:40:57.700 --> 02:41:03.940
Feelin'. Yeah. Face. Yeah, that's a good one. Yeah. God, most of the songs I like a lot

02:41:03.940 --> 02:41:09.260
of- Xanadu! Xanadu. I'd say, you know what, I'd say The Seven Jump, because a lot of people

02:41:09.260 --> 02:41:13.300
hate on The Seven Jump, but I love The Seven Jump. Love. Ooh, that's a good one, too. Night

02:41:13.300 --> 02:41:20.300
in motion. Those are all good songs. And Conga Feelin', fuck, I love Conga Feelin'. Well,

02:41:21.460 --> 02:41:25.860
it's kinda, eh, I don't know. It's fun to play. I think a lot of people know that. I

02:41:25.860 --> 02:41:28.860
wouldn't say that's an underrated song, though. I think a lot of people know that one now.

02:41:28.860 --> 02:41:35.860
I'm trying to think from some of the more recent mixes. Fantasy from Extreme 2. I think

02:41:35.860 --> 02:41:40.260
fantasy from um... extreme 2

02:41:40.260 --> 02:41:43.180
no fantasy was in max 1

02:41:43.180 --> 02:41:45.940
it was in max 1 and then didn't come back from max 2

02:41:45.940 --> 02:41:47.740
say that one?

02:41:47.740 --> 02:41:49.340
yeah

02:41:49.340 --> 02:41:54.860
is that it? That's max 2, fantasy was the one that was 0b from max 1

02:41:54.860 --> 02:41:57.180
yeah that one doesn't need to go away

02:41:57.180 --> 02:42:02.100
the other one that was pretty good

02:42:02.100 --> 02:42:03.340
i'm trying to think of u.s.

02:42:03.340 --> 02:42:06.620
Also, there's US licenses that I think are incredibly underrated.

02:42:06.620 --> 02:42:08.380
I don't think...

02:42:08.380 --> 02:42:12.500
The PlayStation 2 fanboys need to recognize that the Xbox has some really

02:42:12.500 --> 02:42:15.340
good songs on UltraMix 2, such as Skulk.

02:42:15.340 --> 02:42:18.220
But I don't know if I would call that underrated, because anyone that's played it

02:42:18.220 --> 02:42:19.180
knows it's awesome.

02:42:19.180 --> 02:42:22.460
But I'm trying to think of other US licenses that I think are a little bit underrated.

02:42:22.460 --> 02:42:26.580
I always liked Dark Black Forest, and I know a lot of people hated on that song, but I thought it was a great

02:42:26.580 --> 02:42:30.340
song. Like, just a very random choice for DDR. I thought it was great.

02:42:30.340 --> 02:42:31.840
and

02:42:31.840 --> 02:42:35.060
the other one there's another one that was really good those also m

02:42:35.060 --> 02:42:37.380
mack's uh...

02:42:37.380 --> 02:42:38.460
measures they

02:42:38.460 --> 02:42:39.940
yet

02:42:39.940 --> 02:42:41.660
take it to the morning

02:42:41.660 --> 02:42:47.140
yeah i don't know if you're going to

02:42:47.140 --> 02:42:51.020
uh... have a question for me because i see our chat room is suddenly seeing my

02:42:51.020 --> 02:42:51.820
house

02:42:51.820 --> 02:42:54.540
my house would you do if they put my house india are because i would be

02:42:54.540 --> 02:42:57.140
successful but i don't know

02:42:57.140 --> 02:43:06.640
Yeah, I would say that's pretty bad, but thank God it hasn't been put in, and I would have to show my fiancé and she'd have to laugh at me.

02:43:06.640 --> 02:43:13.140
I actually like Hey Mama a lot in Ultramix 3, though. I gotta say, that was a good choice. For Black Eyed Peas, that was a really good choice.

02:43:17.140 --> 02:43:20.140
Can you believe I've never heard anything by them?

02:43:20.140 --> 02:43:21.140
Who, Black Eyed Peas?

02:43:21.140 --> 02:43:22.140
Yep, never.

02:43:23.140 --> 02:43:25.140
You don't have to fix that either.

02:43:25.140 --> 02:43:26.140
Hold on, hold on.

02:43:26.140 --> 02:43:28.140
You really don't have to fix that.

02:43:28.140 --> 02:43:30.140
Give me one chance here.

02:43:30.140 --> 02:43:33.140
I realized I went for three years without hearing a single Britney Spears song.

02:43:33.140 --> 02:43:34.140
I know.

02:43:34.140 --> 02:43:37.140
But now that you've heard Britney Spears, you love them, don't you?

02:43:37.140 --> 02:43:38.140
No.

02:43:38.140 --> 02:43:39.140
Just kidding.

02:43:39.140 --> 02:43:41.140
Okay, here, try this a little bit.

02:43:41.140 --> 02:43:43.140
This is a song that's in UltraMix 3.

02:43:43.140 --> 02:43:46.140
And I'm not going to say you're going to like this, because you're probably not going to, but it's kind of groovy.

02:43:46.140 --> 02:43:47.140
It's Hey Mama.

02:43:51.140 --> 02:43:52.140
I have heard this song.

02:43:52.140 --> 02:44:02.180
I heard it in spin I heard it in spin and I heard it in black

02:44:02.180 --> 02:44:03.180
eyed peas?

02:44:03.180 --> 02:44:05.740
Yeah Oh, in the Best Buy commercial, the, you know

02:44:05.740 --> 02:44:06.740
REE-NIX!

02:44:06.740 --> 02:44:12.140
Yeah, I know I friggin' hate this microphone

02:44:12.140 --> 02:44:16.980
Black eyed peas are okay Zander C wants to know, do I suck at DDR if

02:44:16.980 --> 02:44:21.340
I can't beat Max Unlimited on Heavy, and is it weird that I can't beat that but manage

02:44:21.340 --> 02:44:25.740
to beat Charlene on In the Groove an Expert. I can't beat Max on Limited on Heavy.

02:44:25.740 --> 02:44:31.580
I can. I used to play doubles, and I would play some crazy shit in doubles, and I still

02:44:31.580 --> 02:44:35.580
couldn't beat it. It's just too fast. It's not really a song that should be played. They

02:44:35.580 --> 02:44:39.980
just made it like really super hard, and ooh, I did it. But it's not a song that can be

02:44:39.980 --> 02:44:45.220
played for fun. And I don't think it's odd that you can't beat that... Fuck, I'm gonna

02:44:45.220 --> 02:44:49.660
beat this microphone up. I don't think it's odd that you can beat that, or you can't beat

02:44:49.660 --> 02:44:55.300
that you can be Charlene because I remember I think it was Charlene I might

02:44:55.300 --> 02:45:01.140
be mixing it up with one of the erotic songs but I think maybe I'm I might be

02:45:01.140 --> 02:45:04.420
mixing up Charlene with lemmings on the run but I remember that one of them on

02:45:04.420 --> 02:45:07.940
heavy had an awful lot of freezes was like the big thing was there's a lot of

02:45:07.940 --> 02:45:13.340
freezes and hands and I if I could do hands unfortunately I'm very tall and my

02:45:13.340 --> 02:45:16.860
back will go out very easily if I do too much of the hands thing which is one of

02:45:16.860 --> 02:45:20.220
the reasons I don't like in the group because I hate the hands thing I could

02:45:20.220 --> 02:45:24.300
almost beat it though if it weren't for that I don't remember if it was that or

02:45:24.300 --> 02:45:27.820
Charlene that I was very close to beating but yet I haven't come close to

02:45:27.820 --> 02:45:30.820
meeting Max Unlimited and I have no problem sharing that I don't think you

02:45:30.820 --> 02:45:35.580
have to necessarily be the bestest DDR player in the world I mean who cares

02:45:35.580 --> 02:45:39.340
you play it because it's fun that's why I play it that's why I don't mind when

02:45:39.340 --> 02:45:42.680
they release a new mix of DDR and there's only one 10-footer in it and a

02:45:42.680 --> 02:45:46.380
bunch of sevens I like the game better that way because DDR for me is more of a

02:45:46.380 --> 02:45:53.380
a casual workout type thing and not a I want to wheeze and throw up, you know, lung chunks

02:45:53.380 --> 02:45:54.380
after one song.

02:45:54.380 --> 02:46:01.380
I want to get back to the wheezing part. That's fun.

02:46:01.380 --> 02:46:07.020
The sad thing is I probably wouldn't even be able to beat like Breakdown or stay on

02:46:07.020 --> 02:46:08.820
Heavy and I used to be able to do those no problem.

02:46:08.820 --> 02:46:09.820
I would break down.

02:46:09.820 --> 02:46:11.860
I probably couldn't do it.

02:46:11.860 --> 02:46:22.860
I think Queen of Fiance really cuts into the 8-hour sessions of DDR that I used to do in the arcade. It's just, I can't do it anymore.

02:46:22.860 --> 02:46:27.860
Oh, it's Queen of Light that's the freezes in hands, and Charlene is just a lot of runs.

02:46:27.860 --> 02:46:31.860
Runs are retarded, especially if it's for no reason whatsoever.

02:46:31.860 --> 02:46:33.360
What was the other one I came really close to beating?

02:46:33.360 --> 02:46:34.660
A Zodiac, I think, though?

02:46:34.660 --> 02:46:35.360
Doo-doo-doo-doo.

02:46:35.360 --> 02:46:35.860
I like that song.

02:46:35.860 --> 02:46:37.360
I actually really like that song a lot.

02:46:37.360 --> 02:46:40.760
Even, you know, considering that we've said some negative things about In a Groove,

02:46:40.760 --> 02:46:43.860
I do really like some of the music, and Zodiac's one of the songs I really, really like.

02:46:43.860 --> 02:46:45.560
Anubis is my favorite song, though.

02:46:45.560 --> 02:46:46.460
That song kicks ass.

02:46:46.460 --> 02:46:48.860
I really like that song.

02:46:48.860 --> 02:46:53.160
You can tell I have a thing for, uh, Banzai.

02:46:53.160 --> 02:46:56.260
Uh, Legend of Zaku wants to say,

02:46:56.260 --> 02:46:59.360
I'm in the market for some good-ass sake.

02:46:59.360 --> 02:47:00.360
Any suggestions?

02:47:00.360 --> 02:47:03.360
I've never had sake in my life, believe it or not, so I can't help you.

02:47:03.360 --> 02:47:08.360
There's a brand I like, but it's a blessing to me. I can't remember how to pronounce the name, so give me a sec, I'll look for it.

02:47:08.360 --> 02:47:10.360
Okay, uh, Loki?

02:47:10.360 --> 02:47:11.360
I don't drink sake.

02:47:11.360 --> 02:47:12.360
Yeah, I don't drink it either.

02:47:12.360 --> 02:47:17.360
What's a plum wine that you usually get? I know that's not sake, but speaking of, like, you know, Asian liquor, what was that? But that was good.

02:47:17.360 --> 02:47:20.360
Uh, shoot.

02:47:20.360 --> 02:47:23.360
The cheap stuff I buy is the Takora brand.

02:47:23.360 --> 02:47:24.360
Okay.

02:47:24.360 --> 02:47:27.360
All right, check out the, uh, sake thing.

02:47:27.360 --> 02:47:28.360
Sake thing.

02:47:28.360 --> 02:47:33.920
Team Sakeol actually has his own energy drink, just some random trivia thrown in there.

02:47:33.920 --> 02:47:37.520
Legend of Sake wants to know, I wonder if you TiVo'd last week's episodes of Direct

02:47:37.520 --> 02:47:43.600
Effect in which yours truly was seen as well as New York City's best DDR player being profiled.

02:47:43.600 --> 02:47:47.560
I forgot to set the TiVo, and I had it on there and everything, I forgot to do it.

02:47:47.560 --> 02:47:51.480
But I know they're going to rerun it to death, it'll be on again, so I'm not too worried.

02:47:51.480 --> 02:47:53.560
And I'm sure Sake will tell me when it's being rerun.

02:47:53.560 --> 02:47:58.960
And here's the good brand for the ume-shuu, the plum wine, because it's got the green

02:47:58.960 --> 02:47:59.960
plums at the bottom.

02:47:59.960 --> 02:48:01.960
Ah, yes, I remember that.

02:48:01.960 --> 02:48:06.160
Yes, you bought that once, and we got drunk off that shit.

02:48:06.160 --> 02:48:08.960
And you can't tell because it doesn't taste like booze.

02:48:08.960 --> 02:48:11.960
One of the first times me and you got drunk together was off that stuff.

02:48:11.960 --> 02:48:12.960
Off that stuff?

02:48:12.960 --> 02:48:16.960
All right, so now look up that sake and let us know.

02:48:16.960 --> 02:48:18.760
Meanwhile, more questions.

02:48:18.760 --> 02:48:20.560
We're doing Ask Orange Lounge here on Orange Lounge Radio.

02:48:20.560 --> 02:48:23.460
If you're just joining us, this is a portion of the show where the listeners can submit

02:48:23.460 --> 02:48:25.460
questions to us and we answer them because we love our listeners.

02:48:25.460 --> 02:48:28.460
You should join us, you're a bit late too.

02:48:28.460 --> 02:48:31.460
Seeing as, well, there's only like ten minutes of show left.

02:48:31.460 --> 02:48:36.460
Um, wow, lots of questions from NintendoManiac64 and wants to know this.

02:48:36.460 --> 02:48:41.460
Uh, I want to learn Japanese but I'm poor so I can't pay anything and there's nothing

02:48:41.460 --> 02:48:44.460
or anyone near me that could teach it to me for free.

02:48:44.460 --> 02:48:47.460
Anything good and free on the internet, I'm out of ideas.

02:48:47.460 --> 02:48:50.460
I have a suggestion, try out podcasts because there's actually a lot of podcasts out there

02:48:50.460 --> 02:48:54.700
try to teach you how to speak a second language, not just Spanish, but I'm sure there's a Japanese

02:48:54.700 --> 02:48:58.980
one out there, too. A lot of good, free stuff. I don't know if you can find anything at an

02:48:58.980 --> 02:49:04.460
elementary level, but you never know. Also, sometimes if you look on some of the sites

02:49:04.460 --> 02:49:10.300
such as BitTorrent stuff, you can sometimes find and learn how to speak Japanese CD, which,

02:49:10.300 --> 02:49:15.900
you know, isn't, it's better than nothing. Go to college. Or, yeah, or go to college.

02:49:15.900 --> 02:49:25.400
Or if you have a Usenet access and were signed up on MBZworld.com or something like that.

02:49:25.400 --> 02:49:32.100
Anyways, they're CDs. But you can find them just any BitTorrent site. You should be able to find anything.

02:49:32.100 --> 02:49:41.200
I mean, really. Except for whatever reason, the BooBoom Satellites, their CDs are not on the internet.

02:49:41.200 --> 02:49:43.300
Not the one I'm looking for, at least.

02:49:43.300 --> 02:49:47.940
NintendoManiac64 says, did anyone make a YTMND out of your I like big dick quote yet?

02:49:47.940 --> 02:49:50.300
Um, no they haven't, and I hope they don't.

02:49:50.300 --> 02:49:55.560
Uh, also wants to know, how was my Firefox Mario Kart DS decal?

02:49:55.560 --> 02:50:00.420
Um, it was cool, it was, I imagine you probably used that same thing that a lot of

02:50:00.420 --> 02:50:03.940
people use to, to turn a graphic into a, um, emblem.

02:50:03.940 --> 02:50:06.220
But what I want to know is, what was that thing

02:50:06.220 --> 02:50:08.900
where you were going back and forth, because I remember playing you,

02:50:08.900 --> 02:50:12.860
you were going back and forth on the track a lot. Like, I don't know if you were

02:50:12.860 --> 02:50:16.820
trying to do like a bunch of drifts, but you were going really fast, and I know you weren't

02:50:16.820 --> 02:50:21.260
getting that many mushrooms, so I don't know, were you trying to do a bunch of drifts or

02:50:21.260 --> 02:50:22.260
something?

02:50:22.260 --> 02:50:23.260
Snaking.

02:50:23.260 --> 02:50:24.260
Snaking.

02:50:24.260 --> 02:50:25.260
What the hell is this?

02:50:25.260 --> 02:50:26.260
Well, um...

02:50:26.260 --> 02:50:27.260
I didn't know this was taking place.

02:50:27.260 --> 02:50:29.660
You know, things I've seen, though, people doing wasn't snaking, because it was just

02:50:29.660 --> 02:50:32.180
like they're, it looks like they're spasming on the track.

02:50:32.180 --> 02:50:36.320
I understand what snaking is, where you do the mini, um, you drift back and forth really

02:50:36.320 --> 02:50:39.860
quick to do the little boost, so you go faster that way.

02:50:39.860 --> 02:50:43.740
It's hard to do, you have to have the right kart for it, but you can do it.

02:50:43.740 --> 02:50:50.100
But the thing is though, they used to do that actually in, remember back in F-Zero GX, except

02:50:50.100 --> 02:50:55.620
that was done differently, that was with the break boosting or whatever, and you can do

02:50:55.620 --> 02:51:00.020
that with Mario Kart Double Dash, you can do it with the drift, same way.

02:51:00.020 --> 02:51:04.860
But this is something different though, and I don't know why, because when I've seen these

02:51:04.860 --> 02:51:08.660
players, they've been bouncing around literally all over the track.

02:51:08.660 --> 02:51:13.340
So I don't know what that is.

02:51:13.340 --> 02:51:15.540
Is anyone there really gay?

02:51:15.540 --> 02:51:21.420
I'm ignorant and gullible, so I usually can't tell if you guys are joking or not.

02:51:21.420 --> 02:51:27.060
Dark Sakura has a husband, so obviously she is, you know, Dansexual I believe as she calls

02:51:27.060 --> 02:51:28.060
it.

02:51:28.060 --> 02:51:29.060
Dansexual!

02:51:29.060 --> 02:51:34.100
Loki has a fiancé and does not like any of the cock as far as I know.

02:51:34.100 --> 02:51:36.220
Not that he has a problem with that.

02:51:36.220 --> 02:51:38.220
He's completely straight, yes?

02:51:38.220 --> 02:51:45.980
Yes, I am gay. I am literally gay, and it's fine. It's not a joke. We joke about it because

02:51:45.980 --> 02:51:51.620
it's kind of like how gay people can call each other fag and that's okay. Just like

02:51:51.620 --> 02:51:59.420
how black people always call... Never mind. Forget it. But, yes, I'm gay and so is Exeter,

02:51:59.420 --> 02:52:02.340
but we are not together. That's a very common misconception I think people think because

02:52:02.340 --> 02:52:06.140
Exeter and I live together and we're both gay. We must be fucking, but that's not true.

02:52:06.140 --> 02:52:10.140
No, Xfer and I are just buds, we're like brothers, nothing like that.

02:52:10.140 --> 02:52:15.340
However, I date, I've been seeing someone, and I've kind of brought that up a couple

02:52:15.340 --> 02:52:19.840
times on the show, but I don't think he'd be used to the idea of me talking about him

02:52:19.840 --> 02:52:23.180
on the air yet, and he could be listening, so I don't say a whole lot about it.

02:52:23.180 --> 02:52:24.180
But he's cool.

02:52:24.180 --> 02:52:25.180
He's a gamer, too.

02:52:25.180 --> 02:52:27.740
He plays Mario Kart DS with me, so he rocks.

02:52:27.740 --> 02:52:31.420
And who else?

02:52:31.420 --> 02:52:33.340
I think he's cute, too.

02:52:33.340 --> 02:52:34.340
Oh, thank you.

02:52:34.340 --> 02:52:38.340
Thank you. He is cute. He is a cutie. A little quiet sometimes, but a cutie, I like.

02:52:38.340 --> 02:52:40.840
Even though the one time I met him I was highly intoxicated.

02:52:40.840 --> 02:52:42.840
You were very intoxicated, but he's a nice guy.

02:52:44.840 --> 02:52:47.840
And I don't think Miklotov would mind me sharing that he's gay too.

02:52:47.840 --> 02:52:49.840
And that's cool.

02:52:49.840 --> 02:52:52.340
So yes, there are really gay people that do this.

02:52:52.340 --> 02:52:55.840
But we don't talk a whole lot about, well we do talk about the sexuality thing,

02:52:55.840 --> 02:52:57.840
and I think it might be hard to tell that we're joking sometimes,

02:52:57.840 --> 02:53:02.840
but like on the podcast, I don't think I've ever really brought this up,

02:53:02.840 --> 02:53:06.120
up, although I need to at some point, and I'm sure we'll get into a discussion at some

02:53:06.120 --> 02:53:12.400
point about minority gamers. It doesn't come up because, you know, we're about games, and

02:53:12.400 --> 02:53:16.600
sexuality usually doesn't play into video games, unless we're going to talk about booth

02:53:16.600 --> 02:53:20.520
babes at E3. We're going to talk about, there is sexism on the internet, and I know that

02:53:20.520 --> 02:53:26.440
Dark Soccer has seen this shit firsthand, because not just her, but other girl presenters

02:53:26.440 --> 02:53:31.280
on podcasts, game podcasts, get targeted. They do. Because some guys don't know how

02:53:31.280 --> 02:53:33.720
how to deal with that. I don't know what it is. They assume that she's a giggling girl.

02:53:33.720 --> 02:53:39.720
To quote one site, put down the controller and get back in the kitchen. Excuse me, fuck

02:53:39.720 --> 02:53:49.720
you. That's just stupid. Okay, he's got too many questions, so I'm jumping right to his

02:53:49.720 --> 02:53:54.920
last question. Why did you say I used the decal generator? I made my Firefox decal myself.

02:53:54.920 --> 02:54:04.500
two hours good for you sorry I made an assumption shoot me rare I'm going to

02:54:04.500 --> 02:54:14.660
make a penis decal I have to play the game just to do that I like in our chat

02:54:14.660 --> 02:54:18.340
room there I'm just now reading all the chat room is that everybody is like

02:54:18.340 --> 02:54:22.420
gasping and and saying that they're so surprised at the fact that I'm gay and

02:54:22.420 --> 02:54:29.180
and Zaku says that Sky can't say nigga oh crap oh crap I just saw man I screwed

02:54:29.180 --> 02:54:36.140
up and then of course my favorite term ever gamer color of Sakura says I'm a

02:54:36.140 --> 02:54:46.900
gamer with a G a y-cat like get it gamer love it moving on color of Sakura wants

02:54:46.900 --> 02:54:51.780
to know any suggestions on what 2dx song track I should buy I have 2dx red and

02:54:51.780 --> 02:54:55.420
Happy Sky, so other than those two.

02:54:55.420 --> 02:54:58.580
I love, love, love Fifth Style.

02:54:58.580 --> 02:55:00.700
Go figure, I love Fifth Style's soundtrack.

02:55:00.700 --> 02:55:01.620
So I suggest that.

02:55:01.620 --> 02:55:03.540
If you're going to go old school, go for Fifth Style.

02:55:03.540 --> 02:55:05.740
I used to wake up to that every morning.

02:55:05.740 --> 02:55:07.060
Eight.

02:55:07.060 --> 02:55:09.580
There you have it.

02:55:09.580 --> 02:55:12.500
Neodude Zero says, what good dance pads are there,

02:55:12.500 --> 02:55:16.740
besides Red Octane, that don't cost $500?

02:55:16.740 --> 02:55:18.980
There's the kind you build yourself.

02:55:18.980 --> 02:55:20.980
There's the one that DDR Game puts out,

02:55:20.980 --> 02:55:24.740
but I'm going to be honest, we played it at E3, not impressed by their product.

02:55:24.740 --> 02:55:26.420
Emmett injured.

02:55:26.420 --> 02:55:28.660
That's right, that's right, I remember that.

02:55:28.660 --> 02:55:31.020
Yeah, so honestly, um...

02:55:31.020 --> 02:55:35.780
I suppose if you want something that is cheap and effective and you don't play a lot of cattas,

02:55:35.780 --> 02:55:37.660
just go for the $20 Mad Catz ones.

02:55:37.660 --> 02:55:42.220
I know a lot of people knock on the Mad Catz ones, but honestly, for the casual DDR player,

02:55:42.220 --> 02:55:43.220
it'll work. It'll get you through the day.

02:55:43.220 --> 02:55:46.380
Or if you take a soft pad and, you know, mount it on wood,

02:55:46.380 --> 02:55:49.100
and, you know, do the, uh...

02:55:49.100 --> 02:55:53.100
you know that's a good idea too yeah just basically mounting something on a

02:55:53.100 --> 02:55:53.820
board

02:55:53.820 --> 02:55:57.460
makes a soft pad even better a guana girl used to have that she came up again here

02:55:57.460 --> 02:56:00.620
but as she used to have that at all the apartment they worked very very well

02:56:00.620 --> 02:56:05.620
that was the first 9 footer i ever passed was on those me too i think no second 9 footer i ever did was on those

02:56:05.620 --> 02:56:09.460
because i passed um electro tuned that's right

02:56:09.460 --> 02:56:13.460
and then i but i no it wasn't electro tuned it was

02:56:13.460 --> 02:56:16.980
it was something it was looping it was not a crisis it was looping looping

02:56:46.980 --> 02:56:49.900
um... test location came out. I remember that.

02:56:49.900 --> 02:56:54.380
That was so stupid. But good. It was good. And it was so easy.

02:56:54.380 --> 02:56:56.660
I miss bimani parties. We need to have another one.

02:56:56.660 --> 02:57:01.020
We do. I have a house now. Let's just get drunk and call it a bimani party.

02:57:01.020 --> 02:57:04.900
I think once I get my house in order, I'm planning on having one. Badass. If Dan doesn't like it.

02:57:04.900 --> 02:57:06.860
We should broadcast live from it.

02:57:06.860 --> 02:57:10.940
That would rock. Legend of Zaku says, how come game chain stores and some small time

02:57:10.940 --> 02:57:14.380
mom and pop stores treat new sealed games like beater copies

02:57:14.380 --> 02:57:18.860
when trying to get money for them. Because they assume you stole them.

02:57:18.860 --> 02:57:22.220
Honestly, I think that's why a lot of people have policies against sealed

02:57:22.220 --> 02:57:23.020
games is because

02:57:23.020 --> 02:57:26.580
it's assumed that they're stolen, and I know what you're doing. I know you didn't steal them.

02:57:26.580 --> 02:57:28.540
I know you're trying to sell back promo copies,

02:57:28.540 --> 02:57:31.900
but you're not supposed to sell back promo copies either. It's actually...

02:57:31.900 --> 02:57:35.980
I don't know so much about giveaways. Giveaways is kind of a gray area,

02:57:35.980 --> 02:57:39.940
but at least promo copies, usually when they do giveaways, they give away promo copies,

02:57:39.940 --> 02:57:43.100
and as part of the deal with promo copies, you're not supposed to sell them.

02:57:43.100 --> 02:57:47.160
That's why the, like with motion pictures and stuff, big deal, like they put the tracking

02:57:47.160 --> 02:57:50.120
numbers on the screeners and all that shit, you know, eh.

02:57:50.120 --> 02:57:51.120
Crazy stuff.

02:57:51.120 --> 02:57:56.000
Almost done with the show, let's get to one last question here.

02:57:56.000 --> 02:58:02.860
Rayne wants to know, what can I use to convert WMV3 encoded media to anything that isn't

02:58:02.860 --> 02:58:07.340
WMV3, AVI, MPEG, DivX, etc. on a PC?

02:58:07.340 --> 02:58:08.340
I have no idea.

02:58:08.340 --> 02:58:10.340
I don't know enough about video encoding, I'm going to be honest.

02:58:10.340 --> 02:58:12.340
You have to Google and look it up!

02:58:40.340 --> 02:58:42.340
I'm hoping someone in our chat knows.

02:58:42.340 --> 02:58:46.340
We just had a link posted to JetAudio.com.

02:58:46.340 --> 02:58:48.340
There we go. There you have it.

02:58:48.340 --> 02:58:51.340
Well, kids, it's about 9.30. It's about time for us to wrap up the show.

02:58:51.340 --> 02:58:53.340
And I appreciate you guys participating tonight.

02:58:53.340 --> 02:58:55.340
Sorry we didn't get to all the questions.

02:58:55.340 --> 02:58:57.340
But it was a very popular segment.

02:58:57.340 --> 02:58:59.340
Sorry about Skype, you guys. We'll be back next week.

02:58:59.340 --> 02:59:02.340
I will reinstall Skype so we have it again.

02:59:02.340 --> 02:59:04.340

Facts of life, facts of love
