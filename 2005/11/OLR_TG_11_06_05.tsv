109	2730	Orange Lounge Radio To Go Edition, week of November 7th, 2005.
3010	13413	You're tuned in to the Orange Lounge Radio To Go Edition, your podcast home for all the latest video game news and gamer chat.
13694	17635	Now, here are your hosts, DarkSakura, Sky, and Loki.
18755	20056	Hello, everybody.
20276	23717	Once again, you're tuned in to Orange Lounge Radio To Go.
23877	27138	It's the podcast dedicated to video games that don't suck.
27830	33012	But sometimes we have to talk about a few games that do suck, only to tell you to stay far, far away from them.
33512	35313	My name is Rob Roberts, you might know me as Sky.
35353	39434	Joining me, as always, actually back from a little vacation, is DarkSakura.
40114	43816	Not really a vacation, seeing as how I was working my ass off during all that time.
44236	46897	Well, okay, but a vacation from the show.
47037	47697	Did you miss us?
48778	49558	My aim's improving.
49698	50718	That's what I thought you'd say.
50798	55440	Now, ironically enough, even though you're out past two weeks, you're not going to be here next week.
56087	58169	I hope I get to meet Adam Curry's hair.
58209	59690	I mean, Adam Curry.
81223	81623	Be awesome.
82163	83184	He's so fabulous!
83304	84564	I know, he's the man.
85144	88185	I hate to keep bringing up his hair, but I really am just enamored with it.
88245	89005	How could you not?
89285	92866	If you watched MTV in the 80s, how could you not?
93806	99048	When I was old enough to appreciate boys, I was enamored of him, I have to say.
99848	105290	Alright, also joining us, someone who's still not old enough to appreciate boys, it's Loki!
106590	106790	Huh?
108070	109011	Bad joke, forget it.
109311	109711	What's up?
110683	111284	Not much.
111524	116690	I'm in one of those moods tonight, as I mentioned on the live three-hour program that's on Orange Lounge Radio.
117210	117651	How you doing?
117691	118652	How was your week, Loki?
118872	119933	My week was good.
120494	124618	I killed lots of my boss and other people at the same time.
125029	125670	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
142651	145412	DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
159412	167454	Um, seeing as how school and everything has been kicking my butt, I did, however, get Guitar Hero on Friday.
168374	169875	Been playing the crap out of it.
170595	171275	I love that game.
171975	174776	Actually, it's more or less me playing more than I feel and on repeat.
175116	176636	Because I love that song.
177316	181457	You know, it wasn't until I played it on your TV that I ever started missing more than one note in a row.
181777	182938	Oh, jeez, sorry.
182958	187639	Well, it's because I'm standing up and looking down and have this killer of a headache, but...
188815	189336	I'm sorry.
189716	190638	It's all perspective.
190678	192601	I think I would have done better had I been sitting down.
192941	195685	But you have to sort of stand and rock out with that guitar, you know?
196627	196987	And then...
199859	205902	Really, it's been, you know, it's hard for me to get to my TV because Dan's been going on a Star Wars kick lately.
207043	208664	Is he playing the Battlefront 2 game?
208784	213286	No, he's freaking watching Episode 3 and then went back and watched the others.
213426	214667	Oh, that kind of Star Wars kick.
214687	224112	So, I hear, you know, just this bad acting coming out of Hayden Christensen and I'm like, oh, no.
224692	225992	So, George Lucas owes me $30.
227702	228042	All right.
228542	229603	Loki, how was your gaming week?
230083	230944	My week was good.
230964	238187	I actually was playing more PSP stuff than anything, which is pretty interesting, complete opposite of before.
239328	251654	What I've been playing lately has been Grand Theft Auto, and what it is is we've got four copies in the office at work, and the four of us go down every break twice a day and do four-player deathmatch games.
252626	254007	and lately it's been pretty good.
254087	264793	My boss has been getting a lot better, but I kicked the crap out of all of them the other day with my Janet Reno character who's a kick-ass sharpshooter with a rocket launcher.
265594	268155	So I'm pretty deadly with that thing.
268215	275259	And it's funny seeing Janet Reno run around with a chainsaw and murder people, but don't underestimate old women.
276171	276972	The multiplayer is really fun.
276992	280935	The only thing though is I'm not really interested in the other multiplayer modes like the capture the flag and stuff.
291864	294025	I haven't played the console version of Star Wars Battlefront 2 yet.
312352	342201	so I can't really compare the two but it did seem pretty plain to me like very the levels remind me of stuff that might have been on say the PlayStation like the original PlayStation stuff so but other than that it was pretty fun I mean I did have trouble with seeing some of the characters because they kind of blended into the background so that kind of sucked but the space battles and stuff were pretty fun and I was just kind of reminded me of some of the older games for the PlayStation 1 though I can't remember the title off the top of my head but
342759	343640	Thank you for watching!
360916	362096	All right.
362457	369879	Now, I was promising last week on the podcast that I would actually be giving a review of the Taito collection that was recently released for Xbox.
370179	377162	However, I'm tabling that yet another week because I bought a game this week that kind of took up most of my game time, and that was Guitar Hero.
378002	379803	I know all three of us have mentioned it now, but I really did.
379843	380703	I picked up Guitar Hero.
381344	382024	It's awesome.
382464	383764	It's a great music game.
383945	384885	It's like Fuse...
385385	387606	Guitar Freaks, the Konami Guitar Freaks game.
387646	392969	If you've ever played it, fuse that with amplitude frequency, and it's really what you've got here.
393049	396270	Except, you know, it's not really a Guitar Freaks clone.
396310	398411	It really does improve, I think, on that.
398991	405214	In fact, it doesn't even really seem inspired by Guitar Freaks as much as it does seem inspired by frequency and amplitude.
405234	409336	And to some extent, Karaoke Revolution as well, because Harmonix developed that game as well.
409616	411117	So I think those of you guys that are kind of missing...
412206	415248	Frequency and Amplitude in those games, you're going to really enjoy Guitar Hero.
415909	422633	It's pretty much the same idea with the ISO, notes kind of falling down, and great song list.
422694	427957	Freeze pops back, a lot of unsigned bands, great, great cover songs in this game.
428257	434502	They're not the actual songs, but they sound so much like them, it's very hard to tell the difference.
435122	436883	Harmonix did an outstanding job on this game.
436943	439365	Red Octane put together a very good controller for the game.
439625	440566	The controller is solid.
440626	442066	It's even got a whammy bar, people.
442487	443187	It's got a whammy bar.
443567	444467	What more do I need to say?
445028	445668	It's a great game.
445708	446669	I hope there's a sequel.
447369	451311	Even if you're not that into music games, I think Guitar Hero is something very accessible.
452471	455233	What I like about Guitar Hero, what I really like is the art direction.
455573	457614	The artwork is outstanding.
457874	459355	The way the game is put together is great.
459635	467179	But where I think Guitar Hero really shines is it's not put together like most of Konami's Bomani games where you walk up, play your game, leave.
467799	486491	What I like about Guitar Heroes is it's got that little story mode that kind of, you know, it makes all these little extras so much fun, like getting to see your review of how you did in the paper and having the, you know, blow up and the guitar, you know, spinning around when you're doing a really good job and just setting it on fire when you're done.
490081	491282	and all that stuff.
491622	494503	It's just amazing the way they have it all put together is great.
494543	496984	So I highly recommend Guitar Hero if you're a music game fan.
497004	500205	If you're not a music game fan, I do still recommend you check it out at least.
500245	510209	It's one of the more accessible games and I'm definitely looking forward to Guitar Hero 2, which I think would be a given at this point because I did not just spend $70 on game and controller for there to only be this one game, okay?
512253	522940	Alright, now since it's been a little while since DarkSakura's been able to be on the program, we have to start off tonight, because she's got a little catch-up to do, and you know that you missed it.
523520	531526	It's the one and only advice column, because you guys, if we stayed home and played video games all day long, we'd have no time to go out and set guitars on fire.
532646	532947	Rock.
533287	539291	So, DarkSakura, why don't you tell us what your advice column is all about tonight?
542779	546942	Today's piece of advice is how to escape from the trunk of a car.
549904	555668	First of all, if you're dumb enough to get stuck in the trunk of a car, you shouldn't have my mercy, but let's go ahead and be nice anyway.
556549	561973	Number one, if you're in a trunk that is up against the backseat of a car, try to get the seats down.
562733	567376	Number two, if the trunk has a cable release, pull on it to release the latch.
567396	569978	Did I think any car built after, what was it, 86 was it?
572771	575134	3.
572911	575134	Look for tools to pry the latch open.
575194	577156	Many cars have emergency kits under the spare tire.
577176	578297	Use a screwdriver or crowbar to open the latch. 4.
595982	599584	Dismantle the car's brake lights by yanking wires and kicking the lights out.
599944	602725	Then wave and yell and signal to passersby or other cars.
603746	605186	But my final piece of advice?
605427	605667	Yes.
609228	611810	Just don't get stuck in the trunk.
611870	612250	God.
612590	614791	Don't make friends who are in the mafia.
615956	617676	Yeah, don't make friends who are in the mafia.
618477	622037	And don't try to sneak people into drive-thrus and all that stuff.
622097	623257	Or not drive-thrus, drive-ins.
623397	626298	I remember, though, at, what was it, Spiggle 2?
627198	634160	Yes, Sunnyvale Golf Land, DR. Right, where we do lanky style in the backseat of Iguana, in the trunk of Iguana Girls' car.
634560	637480	So we could all make it over to Lion's, I remember that now, the restaurant.
638620	639201	Hilarious.
639301	641321	I have never seen paleness.
644485	645166	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
665506	681684	Well, not even a week later, here it is, an announcement going out that Play, a video game symphony, which is being put together by JMP Productions, who is the team behind Dear Friends, music from Final Fantasy, they are going to go on a worldwide tour.
682145	694037	It's going to kick off in North America sometime in the year 2006, and it's going to have music from Battlefield 1942, World of Warcraft, Final Fantasy, The Elder Scrolls III, and much, much more.
694137	700023	The maestro will be Arnie Roth, who I believe was the man at More Friends.
700344	701885	I might be getting that wrong.
701925	702266	I don't know.
703607	704128	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
723433	726876	DarkSakura, is this a concert that sounds like something you'd want to go to?
726896	728758	Maybe get a little culture with your game?
749093	758297	Well, I listen to real classical music, but I don't know that it would be worth the ticket unless they actually put stuff that people actually play.
760017	764379	Lots of people play World of Warcraft and Final Fantasy.
765760	767300	It's not anything I have any interest in.
767600	768921	Maybe if it was console games.
770593	774415	Well, okay, I guess that's true, because most of those games we named off there were PC games.
774435	776537	But you've got to assume that there's going to be some console in there, too.
776577	779298	I mean, Final Fantasy console, but we've seen that before.
779318	779739	Maybe, maybe.
779879	785022	Everything that you've named off are MMOs.
786302	787123	Okay, okay.
787435	788276	Well, not Battlefield 1942.
788736	789637	Oh, yeah, Battlefield 1942.
789757	790418	That's true.
790618	794161	But that's still very, it's kind of more known as a PC title, I think.
794181	796182	Null of Scrolls isn't an MMO either.
796202	798404	It's not an MMO, but it's... PC games.
798625	802928	Yeah, they're all PC games, or at least... We need a console series like that.
803028	811756	So as long as it's an expansive, eclectic, but not like where they're including Pong and Donkey Kong or whatever that other... Pong had no freaking music in it.
811776	812957	That other tour is promising.
814648	816269	Thank you for watching!
837301	847185	Alright, we're going to go into another story here, and this has to do, you know we love to talk about video games being made into movies, just because it's happened so much this year, honestly, we've had a lot of gaming news.
847605	853947	Well, the next one out the gate looks like it's going to be Castlevania, that's right, Crystal Sky Pictures.
854327	859010	has picked up the rights to adapt Castlevania and attached to direct Paul W.S.
859230	859670	Anderson.
860010	860570	Paul W.S.
860630	866534	Anderson is the man behind Resident Evil and Mortal Kombat, which were pretty decent video game adaptations.
866734	868995	Granted, better than Alone in the Dark, certainly.
869335	871756	But let's not forget he also did Alien vs. Predator.
872777	873597	So, what can you do?
876044	877985	Anyway, so we don't know much about the story just yet.
878305	879865	More information to come on this.
879965	881106	But what do you guys think?
882226	891329	I remember we do this segment on the live show called Listless where we make our top three list of things that should happen within the video game community.
891409	892650	I know we did one time.
892710	895891	We did video game we would most like to see a movie made out of.
895911	898352	And I seem to remember Castlevania being in the top three.
898712	900912	So is this a good idea or a bad idea?
902333	903673	I'd have to do it right.
903933	905474	I would be very skeptical.
906856	910158	What do you think they could do to help this along?
912180	914282	Well, not screw up the content, hopefully.
914322	915143	Keep true to the game.
915223	920627	Make sure that the publishers of the game had creative control over it.
923850	924811	That would be my guess.
924851	934479	Make sure that they're definitely keeping tabs on what's going on with the game so it stays true to the storyline, content, and everything like that.
936214	936754	All right.
936774	936914	Okay.
937595	945301	What we're going to do now is I promised a little earlier in the show is that we were going to talk a little bit about a follow-up to something we talked about a couple weeks ago.
945662	946723	I don't know if you guys heard about this.
946763	950346	Did you guys hear about the King's Quest IX fan project that was going on?
950386	952968	Now, you know the King's Quest series was developed by Sierra.
953712	954493	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
973209	976971	There wasn't enough demand for these adventure series anymore.
977412	978933	So they stopped making the games.
979353	984236	Well, the fan community, and there's quite a community out there for the King's Quest games, wasn't happy with that answer.
985136	989159	So there's some folks that got together and decided they were going to make a fan game.
990319	997804	But as we reported on the show a couple weeks ago, Vivendi actually issued a cease and desist against the company that was coming together to make this
998044	999465	Thanks for having me.
999485	1000105	No problem.
1000406	1002027	So, how did you discover the King's Quest IX project?
1002047	1002087	Um...
1028325	1031166	You know, it's been so many years now, I don't really remember.
1031906	1034187	How long has the King's Quest IX project been going on?
1034627	1036867	I believe it's been going on for about four years.
1037568	1039128	For about four years, wow.
1039188	1041549	So it's been a long time project in the making.
1042129	1042589	Absolutely.
1042829	1048110	So what was your reaction to the news that Vivendi had issued the cease and desist against the project?
1048731	1051371	I think like a lot of fans, disappointment.
1052872	1054052	You know, sadness and disappointment.
1055160	1059665	So why then did you end up starting the SaveKQIX.org website?
1060426	1064070	Well, because I was disappointed and because I knew there were a lot of fans that were disappointed.
1064551	1066153	I just wanted to try to do something to help.
1066854	1073982	I wanted to do something to try to help convince Vivendi to take a look at this and see if there was a way that the game could be released.
1074767	1085173	Now, I noticed when I was looking at the website that you guys are kind of taking a unique approach to trying to kind of petition Vivendi, so to speak, to take a second look at what they're doing here.
1085333	1090376	And most people would use like a petition online type website for these sorts of drives.
1090416	1093497	But you guys are advising a letter writing campaign.
1093557	1096459	Why did you decide to do letter writing as opposed to petition online?
1096839	1098840	Well, we're actually doing a number of things.
1099040	1100341	One, we're doing the email writing.
1100961	1102382	And then we're also doing the letter writing.
1104915	1113657	The reason we're going with email rather than a petition was because we wanted to make sure that when people emailed, it was coming from a legitimate email address.
1114497	1119758	On an online petition, you can just type in whatever email address you want, so it isn't necessarily legitimate.
1121338	1133000	And in the letter writing campaign, we want as many people as possible to take the time to sit down and write a letter, drop it in the mail, because really those letters mean the most to corporations like Vivinti.
1134795	1135675	Okay, sounds good.
1135755	1140397	So what would be the ideal outcome of this Save King's Quest 9 drive?
1140417	1144518	What do you envision as a realistic possibility for the masses to be able to play the game?
1146419	1148740	Our goal is for the game to be released.
1149100	1157963	Whether it's released as freeware or whether it's released as a legitimate commercial release by Vivendi, we don't really care.
1158503	1160844	We just want the game to be out there so gamers can play it.
1162623	1164785	How big would you say is the community behind this?
1164985	1176234	Because I noticed that the King's Quest community out there is still very large and very active, and part of the reason Vivendi has sort of said they're not going to continue the series in the past is because they don't think they have the support.
1176694	1179216	But it seems to me that there's a very large following out there.
1179596	1181738	How big would you say is the King's Quest following out there?
1182659	1191626	You know, it's hard to give a specific number, but I do believe that there is enough support out there that a commercial release
1192236	1194918	of King's Quest IX would do well.
1195399	1199102	I mean, adventure games in general are still being released.
1199763	1206649	You know, Fahrenheit just came out, The Longest Journey is releasing a sequel, Siberia had two games that sold very well.
1207209	1214115	So I think there still is a pretty good adventure game community out there, but it's hard to put an exact number on it.
1214895	1228904	How would you feel if Vivendi took all this information to see that there was a drive to have the King's Quest series reignited and then they decided to put out their own game as opposed to what these fans have been working on?
1228964	1230785	Is that something you would support?
1231065	1238290	Well, we really would like to see this particular King's Quest game be released.
1239147	1244829	But yeah, we would certainly support Vivendi if they decided they wanted to do their own King's Quest game.
1245329	1246830	So you would prefer to see this game released?
1247410	1249210	I would like to see this game released.
1250051	1256733	I'd love to see them allow this game to come out as a fan game, and then they can release their own official version of King's Quest 9.
1258081	1264866	Alright, so I know we have a lot of PC gaming fans that listen to this program, so how can they help?
1264946	1269549	I know we've talked about writing letters, visiting the website, SaveKQIX.org.
1269869	1275213	How can our listeners best help you guys out if they remember the King's Quest games and would love to see a new entry in the series?
1276113	1282638	The best thing they can do to help is go visit the website, www.SaveKQIX.org.
1283478	1286220	On the website we talk about all the different things that they can do to help.
1287117	1292879	The big thing we're focusing on is sending an email to Vivendi, and we make that very easy to do on our website.
1294079	1295460	You can also blog about us.
1296080	1299501	You can write a letter to Vivendi like we already talked about.
1300261	1302362	Send emails out to all your friends about us.
1302662	1303862	Just help us spread the word.
1303902	1306363	That's the other really important thing that we need people to do.
1307403	1310064	All right, so we hope our listeners can help you guys get the word out there.
1310524	1312305	All right, thanks, Matt, so much for being on the show today.
1312345	1313025	We appreciate it.
1313585	1313966	Thank you.
1314406	1315326	All right, thank you very much.
1317699	1324022	So we also decided to contact Caesar, and Caesar is actually involved with the King's Quest IX project itself.
1324262	1325923	Thank you so much for being on the show today, Caesar.
1326503	1329225	Thank you very much for having me in your show.
1331126	1337949	With all that's happening on King's Quest IX right now, I'm pretty busy right now, but I can't stop the opportunity on the show.
1339049	1342191	Well, we appreciate you taking the time out to help us out with the show.
1342311	1346053	Now, what is your role with the King's Quest IX project, for those that may not know?
1346843	1348925	I'm basically the project director.
1348945	1350106	I'm also the main designer.
1350146	1358552	I basically take the responsibility of having everything going smoothly and handing the assignment to all the people.
1358992	1364897	And I also wrote the script, which came up to be like 1,500 pages, more than 1,500 pages.
1365297	1365978	It's really long.
1366958	1369441	Wow, that's a huge script.
1369461	1372264	Could you tell us a little bit about maybe what the story's about?
1372524	1376388	Does it continue the King's Quest series or is it a new direction?
1376728	1378090	Could you tell us a little bit about the story?
1378991	1380552	It's a little bit of both.
1380632	1384356	We wanted to give some kind of a closure to the King's Quest series, but...
1385979	1391701	It also takes a new direction in the sense that it's a much more darker story.
1391761	1403804	We wanted to create something more for this time, you know, when you see stories like Harry Potter and Lord of the Rings and all that kind of stories that take a much more darker plot.
1404144	1407165	We wanted to take the game into that direction.
1407285	1411186	So you can actually say that it's a mix between King's Quest and Lord of the Rings.
1412607	1436463	All this story, it basically starts when, in the middle of a celebration in the Green Isles, a lot of stuff happens, and Dark Shaman falls into the land, and King Ram sets out to find a way to reverse the spell, and as he does that, he finds out that there's a lot more involved.
1436963	1437023	It
1438166	1441767	It's about a prophecy that has been taking place for a thousand years.
1442548	1444589	And there's societies involved in this.
1445269	1449130	So it's a really complicated and long story.
1450191	1452012	With 1,500 pages, I can't imagine.
1452072	1460395	So now with all that work, having gone into it with the script and your entire team of programmers and art and just everything that goes into this,
1461842	1468926	Is it tough having spent all these hours and then having Vivendi come in and issue this cease and desist?
1468946	1470687	What was your guys' reaction to this news?
1471287	1478991	Well, all this time we knew that it could happen and we were kind of ready for that to happen.
1480032	1492459	As Phoenix Online Studios, we weren't going to stop working as a company, even if we had to change all the stuff that we had into something new.
1492499	1498163	Basically, what we wanted to do was try to get Kings West Night to happen commercially.
1498783	1508049	But in the case that it happened, we had a plan B where we basically could create our own game with everything that we had until that point.
1508089	1513193	Of course, we would have to change a lot of the stuff that we have, but it is doable.
1514155	1515216	I was kind of curious about that.
1515236	1527239	When we first talked about this story, when it kind of hit the news a couple weeks ago, some of us had joked that, oh, well, they could take King's Quest and make it Queen's Journey or something by changing all the art and stuff.
1527279	1528700	So is that a realistic plan B?
1529574	1536741	Well, I wouldn't say that because, I mean, uh, Prince Journey, that's a really good joke.
1548493	1556620	Right, but we will basically have to strip it off from a lot of stuff that it has, because we use a lot of the backstory of Team Quest.
1557020	1565908	Like I say, we wanted to bring a cluster to the series, so if we were to make it a complete original game, we would have to work a lot on it.
1566328	1569171	But it's doable, I mean, it's not impossible.
1569699	1580181	Okay, so now I'm sure you're aware of this savekqix.org website where they're trying to get people to send letters to Vivendi to, you know, save this project.
1580661	1585762	Are you willing to talk to Vivendi one-on-one, sit down at the table, try to work this out?
1586343	1596665	We're basically already talking to Vivendi, but that's about all I can say at the moment because we are under a confidential agreement, so there's not much I can say about that.
1596705	1597525	But yeah, um...
1598365	1604270	The Save King Quest 9 side and all the fans that are trying to help out, I really appreciate their support.
1604510	1611435	I want to take the time to thank them because everything that they've been doing has been working out.
1612516	1620042	And I want to ask them too that if they're going to do it, be really nice to them because they're actually being nice to us.
1620612	1625134	Okay, yeah, so no letters sending over to them like saying, you bastards shutting down the project, blah, blah, blah.
1625174	1626615	No, be professional, right?
1626935	1627916	Be professional.
1628496	1630157	Think out what you're going to say.
1630977	1637181	And especially because, I mean, we've only had all those rights, and they're in their right to...
1638223	1639044	to protect them.
1639504	1645408	And they've seen the work that we've been doing in Kings Quest, and now they're talking to us.
1645968	1648530	But, I mean, what's going to happen, I don't know.
1649370	1650791	We'll just have to wait and see.
1652490	1655214	Thank you very much and thank you very much for having me in the show.
1672133	1679937	Alright, so it was very interesting to hear from Caesar and Matt, both involved in different capacities with the community around the King's Quest games.
1679977	1685760	And what I think is really interesting about this whole thing, I mean, there's a really solid community behind these King's Quest games.
1686100	1693824	And I think, you know, at least me, my personal thoughts on King's Quest is like, it was one of those games I always appreciated and I thought was so much fun.
1693864	1696625	And I always kind of wondered, gee, I wonder what ever happened to King's Quest.
1696645	1698286	Why did they stop making King's Quest games?
1698306	1700207	I don't know, is it just me that's feeling that way?
1700367	1701868	Or, I don't know.
1702755	1704495	Why haven't they made most of the Sierra games?
1704575	1706276	I mean, a lot of them have disappeared.
1706396	1710337	Just, I don't know, like Space Quest, Police Quest.
1710897	1717018	The only one I can think of that came out was Leisure Suit Larry, but that was kind of, it's not the same thing at all.
1717318	1725719	And God, I hope, I hope that if Avendi continues King's Quest, it doesn't, I hope they stick to what made King's Quest work and the formula that was good for the game.
1726059	1728100	But best of luck to these guys, definitely.
1728460	1728740	Sounds good.
1729249	1737312	It's really neat to see the community come together like that no matter what sub-community of the gaming culture it is.
1738112	1740513	I just agree that the emails should be kept constructive.
1740973	1741473	Absolutely.
1741853	1746395	You could do damaging stuff to this if you don't keep your emails professional.
1746855	1747715	Keep it professional.
1748413	1749174	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1770359	1771160	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1792501	1795043	So now, you know, EA's behind a lot of powerhouse games.
1795363	1797244	They are going to be creating the Simpsons games now.
1797304	1797845	So what do you think?
1797925	1799025	Good news for the Simpsons?
1799386	1800406	Bad news for the Simpsons?
1800947	1802107	I don't play Simpsons games?
1802207	1804109	We can only wait and see.
1806210	1809352	Can't be that bad, I suppose, but I don't know.
1810373	1814055	It's really, I can't really make a distinction based on that because...
1815551	1835573	who knows but I would like to see less parodies of existing games because that's kind of what the EA franchise or I mean not the EA the Simpsons franchise seems to have been built on the past couple games as parodies of existing I kind of want to see less of that and something original like a Simpsons game I don't know do you remember Bart's Nightmare on the Super Nintendo I actually own that game anyway forget it
1838373	1842375	Some more details coming out this week on the brand new Super Mario Bros.
1842415	1844736	This is a game coming out for the Nintendo DS.
1845096	1850898	It's going to have wireless two-player action as well as mini-games for up to four players.
1851298	1854199	And this is all coming out in the latest issue of Famitsu Magazine.
1854339	1858380	Will it also include a playable copy of Mario Bros.?
1858561	1860261	Like every other Mario Bros.
1860321	1861982	game that they've released in advance?
1862042	1862382	Oh yeah.
1863343	1865865	I don't know, although I can't see how it couldn't have it.
1866185	1869228	But maybe they could make a touch element in here?
1869509	1869789	I don't know.
1871587	1876791	So this is going to be a versus mode that will be two players, and you can't do four players in the versus mode.
1876811	1877951	That's only for the minigames.
1878832	1879833	This new Super Mario Bros.
1879873	1885957	is going to use 3D graphics, but it's like a side-scrolling game, which I think is a great direction for the series.
1885977	1894943	I think it's a little weird it's coming out on DS and not an actual system, because I remember the first time I played the Mario level inside Super Smash Bros.
1894983	1895363	Melee.
1895603	1897704	I was like, damn, they should make a game out of this.
1897764	1900346	This looks great, and it plays wonderful.
1900907	1901287	I don't know.
1902647	1908549	So, but it sounds like maybe they're kind of heading in this direction a little bit with the new Super Mario Brothers, so I am kind of excited.
1909530	1910690	Loki, what do you got for us tonight?
1911550	1912851	Well, not too much.
1913511	1921313	Did want to mention, though, there was a press release put out by 2K Games, the people behind Elder Scrolls 4.
1922434	1925955	Unfortunately, it looks like the Elder Scrolls 4 has been pushed back to the next
1926642	1934889	To the next fiscal year for Take-Two, that would mean somewhere around, I don't know, next year.
1935109	1939772	Unfortunately, after February, I believe the date I saw was like April or something.
1941154	1943475	Very sad, because that was one of the games I was looking forward to.
1944957	1949220	The other thing about the 360 is it's been rumored and actually kind of,
1949790	1950070	and so on.
1967891	1982976	on our live show actually we found out there are some places that you can find 360s if you haven't ordered one yet or really need to get one on launch day one of the places being Toys R Us is actually doing pre-orders on them you have to do a bundle but it's with a couple games
1983416	1984297	Best Buy, Target, and Best Buy
2002058	2004840	I don't know if this is one of those have-to-have on launch day things.
2004860	2007302	I don't really feel like putting up with all this shortage crap to get one right away.
2007923	2008383	I don't know.
2008724	2010145	I don't know how I feel about it now.
2031769	2038555	Well, I've already got mine ordered, so... I'm hoping, I've got to check with them tomorrow, because I'm going to go in and buy some more stuff.
2039876	2045621	To see if I'm actually getting it on launch day or not, because... I don't know, it's iffy.
2045821	2050305	And I'm going to be very disappointed if I don't, because I did pre-order mine way in advance.
2050965	2055449	And I've heard people that pre-ordered it back in June when they didn't even have two SKUs available.
2056869	2082025	and even they aren't getting one on launch but then again that was an employee so things are gonna get ugly things are gonna get ugly and you know kind of hoping you know that uh if this all pans out you know like it is where there's tons of shortages all we need is another company like Sony or Nintendo to go hey guess what our system's coming out in a few months here you know pick one up if you're pissed off with this stuff you know we're gonna have better games anyways or something
2082671	2082931	DarkSakura
2111189	2116974	It's really hard for me to really explain it unless you go and look at the images and it looks like it's right from the game.
2117314	2120637	Are you sure that they're not pictures of Silent Hill 5 on the PlayStation 3?
2122079	2125381	No, because PlayStation 3 doesn't look that realistic.
2126102	2126883	But these are good shots.
2127183	2127563	Very good.
2129264	2140827	Also, for our European listeners, I have some news about the DS Wi-Fi connection hotspots.
2140967	2148349	Over 7,500 Wi-Fi connection hotspots will be active in the UK from November 25th when Mario Kart DS launches there.
2150830	2153971	It's actually the surface is going to be rolling out over the rest of Europe at that time.
2155151	2172158	Places included Donald's, Coffee Republic, Hilton, Ramada Jarvis Hotels, Road Chef, Welcome Break, First Great Western Railway Station, over 25 student unions and city center, BT Payphones, airports, football stadiums, British Library, Canary Wharf,
2172538	2173779	Where can't you go to get on?
2174179	2175200	All over the place.
2175260	2175800	Even pubs.
2176000	2176780	What about McDonald's?
2177001	2178201	Because, you know, that was big news here.
2179182	2180623	I said that was the first thing I listed.
2181343	2181783	Oh, I'm sorry.
2181823	2182424	I missed that.
2182444	2182644	Sorry.
2183044	2187466	But there's a... It was basically a...
2188547	2201896	If our UK listeners want to see a little bit more on that, if you go to www.thecloud.net or www.btopenzone.com, there's some Wi-Fi hotspot maps there.
2204037	2211182	Games also, another one mentioned that's available for the play on that, of course, is Tony Hawk's American Skateland, which will be released over there on November 18th.
2212603	2214904	Speaking of release dates, I have release dates.
2215385	2215605	Cool.
2217391	2219912	I'm sorry, I missed the other week.
2220533	2221013	That's alright.
2221573	2225494	Of course, Twisted Metal Head-On came out, Xenosaga Episode 2 came out.
2226975	2244982	Coming out on the 11th, we are looking at Zook Tycoon 2, Battleground Europe, Bubble Bobble Revolution, Cold War, Crime Life, Gang Wars, Gun, Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, Legion Arena on PC, Lost in Blue on DS, Super Mario, Superstar Baseball, Nanostray.
2247406	2253178	Sly 3, The Incredibles, The Matrix, Path of Neo, WWE Smackdown vs. Raw 2006
2255689	2256390	Super Princess Peach
2276271	2278674	Also, it should be very interesting.
2279135	2285005	It's kind of a girl power type game, but as long as it's not done cheesy, it has the potential to be really good.
2285405	2288651	I mean, I know a lot of people that will pick Peach in Mario Party just to dominate.
2289105	2304451	Just to point out a few more of the notables coming out this month, Dr. Mario and Tetris Attack on the Game Boy Advance on the 25th, Soul Calibur 3 on the 18th, Sonic Rush on the 18th, Pokemon XD Gale of Darkness on the 18th, and Namco Museum Battle Collection.
2305472	2307313	Also coming out Half-Life 2 on Xbox.
2308333	2312495	I was going to say that the... Oh, damn, I just lost it.
2314015	2316056	Yeah, well, I know those are the UK dates.
2316396	2318117	The thing is, I was going to say...
2318700	2322843	I saw a ton of big games coming out this week, especially the Matrix and stuff.
2323204	2329949	I was surprised to see that they're getting the SmackDown vs. Raw before us, which is kind of neat.
2330349	2333151	I didn't think wrestling was as big of a deal anywhere else but here.
2333752	2334012	I know.
2334232	2334733	News to me.
2335353	2336094	It's interesting.
2336314	2337635	Actually, I found another notable.
2338415	2339536	Shadow the Hedgehog on the 25th.
2339576	2347883	The other thing I was going to mention, though, is Electroplankton, I heard, is only going to be available online or in the Nintendo Manhattan store.
2348979	2351681	So you're not going to be able to find it in your local retailer.
2352382	2357886	I have heard that same thing, that it's only going to be available online, which is a very strange way to sell the game.
2358026	2362630	I don't know if they're trying to make a collector's item out of it or what, but...
2364525	2365466	I know I'm going to pick it up.
2365706	2367187	I'm definitely interested in electroplankton.
2367307	2368148	Looks like a fun game.
2369208	2378776	Anyway, DarkSakura, looks like you've got to run and go save the planet from invaders or something right now.
2378996	2386181	Or at least save myself from an F in Dreamweaver class.
2386341	2388703	Well, your final thought for our listeners then tonight, DarkSakura?
2389003	2389804	Do your homework.
2390144	2391145	Do it early in the week.
2393177	2394218	All right, moving on.
2394598	2402403	I want to talk about the PSP, because I just talked a few minutes ago about the DS games coming out first quarter.
2402423	2406306	Well, here's something that's going to be coming out for the PSP in not too long.
2406366	2408948	It's going to be a Gradius collection.
2408988	2412750	It's coming out on February 9th, and it's Gradius Portable.
2412830	2417534	It's a compilation of Gradius 1 through 4 and Gradius Gaiden.
2418114	2418974	It's going to be coming out.
2419054	2424157	It's a straight port of the previous games, but they're going to be adding a few bonus features as well.
2425137	2431961	And also, you can stretch to the widescreen, otherwise you can just play in its original aspect ratio so the game doesn't look all stretched.
2431981	2434242	But you have the choice to do it either way.
2434342	2435442	I thought it wasn't actually stretched.
2435462	2439424	I thought there were new versions of the game available that were in the widescreen mode.
2440164	2440184	I...
2441932	2445055	Oh, Gradius 1 and 2 will have the widescreen modes.
2445075	2446516	Well, Gradius 1 and 2 will.
2446836	2448357	The other ones, not so much.
2449218	2449558	Got you.
2449898	2450159	All right.
2451019	2454802	Now, here's the biggest thing that's going to come with this, a save feature.
2455983	2459386	So no more getting all the way to level 6 and losing all your lives in the end.
2461027	2462248	You know what's kind of interesting about that?
2462268	2466291	No Salamander or Life Force as it is.
2466412	2468273	No Wi-Fi 2 player either.
2468293	2469414	Yeah, too bad.
2470595	2471437	Maybe for the sequel.
2471477	2472660	Maybe that's what they're holding out on.
2472700	2473061	Who knows?
2473482	2474505	Loki, what else you got for us?
2474866	2477713	Well, speaking of the PSP, the PSP2TV...
2479857	2483881	I believe was launched this week, or I should say is launching this week.
2485042	2492969	They have had a few videos coming out showing how to install this thing, and oh my god, this is not for your average user of a PSP.
2493070	2497814	You have to literally disassemble the entire thing, rip the guts out, put new guts back in, and you're done.
2499095	2500076	It's just, it's not pretty.
2501337	2507963	But if you are out there and you want to spend $120 to pick this thing up, it does look pretty cool.
2508323	2514869	The graphics don't look that bad, but damn, it's definitely voiding the warranty on this thing.
2514889	2517131	You have to have an electronics degree to be able to put this together.
2517211	2527901	Well, you know, it's actually all screws and no actually soldering anything or anything like that, but you are unhooking some ribbon cables and stuff that are very, very delicate and
2529189	2532650	It's not for your average consumer to be able to do this stuff.
2532690	2540492	Now granted, if you do want to have some TV support and you're not willing to break open your PSP, there are some other options coming out.
2541072	2546854	One being this thing that sticks over the entire screen and basically captures the video from the image.
2547694	2553836	I'm not going to say that's going to be that great of a picture, but that's another option out there for you.
2555224	2559050	The other thing which is interesting is there's a company working on mod chips right now.
2559090	2561835	They're supposed to be released in a few weeks here for the PSP.
2562396	2566042	And they're going to be sold on eBay starting off, and the price on those is supposed to be about $25.
2567739	2569401	So that'll be interesting to check out.
2569581	2575006	And supposedly it will allow Homebrew to be run on any version of the PSP.
2575367	2582013	Now on the same note as Homebrew running on any version of the PSP, there's this brand new software coming out called PSP Advanced.
2582654	2591663	And it's basically a video software kind of very similar to iTunes where you can play most video formats and most audio formats.
2592023	2597626	The thing that's interesting about this, though, is it's going to run on any version firmware.
2598006	2603088	And they're saying that it might be on a UMD or something like that, but there's also a part that's on your memory stick.
2604529	2606970	Yeah, that's going to be exploited to run any homebrew.
2606990	2608150	That's what's going to happen.
2608270	2613773	So pretty soon, firmware might not be an issue anymore of running homebrew, so...
2614440	2615040	Very interesting.
2638352	2639132	What you guys have to say.
2639233	2641313	And DarkSakura is always in there looking at the email bag.
2641574	2647356	I've actually started helping her out recently, too, so I go in there sometimes as well because there's just so many of you guys with so many nice things to say.
2647456	2648196	So keep them coming.
2648516	2649337	We like getting emails.
2649977	2650457	Doesn't everybody?
2650958	2653819	We usually try to send one back because we know people like getting emails.
2655039	2655900	All right, what else you got, Loki?
2656520	2662362	Well, the other things I was going to talk about, more of kind of the rumor control stuff.
2662843	2663463	Someone was saying...
2664389	2670251	or actually they were rumored to have a, that Microsoft was thinking about doing an Xbox portable.
2670991	2672972	I don't think that's gonna happen anytime soon.
2674332	2681335	So anyways, beyond that, this kind of ties in with some portable stuff.
2681595	2682335	It's really interesting.
2683919	2689606	There's this UK site, actually, BritishGaming.co.uk.
2690147	2693671	They posted an article about a Resident Evil game.
2694272	2696775	It's basically an online game that's...
2699293	2699473	And, um...
2723986	2725247	So it's kind of interesting.
2725267	2728330	You can find that at BritishGaming.co.uk.
2728450	2731152	Will it have the same bad voice acting as the first game had?
2731613	2732754	I don't know about that.
2733675	2735616	It sounds like it's based off RE4, so I guess not.
2735977	2737038	Yeah, probably not.
2738419	2746726	The other thing is there's been tons of pictures, especially with the Xbox Lounge in Japan, of new faceplates coming out for the 360.
2748291	2752973	I'm going to be the first to say that faceplates for the 360 is the most retarded idea I've ever seen.
2753353	2762217	It's... I don't get it myself, but at the same time, you know, well, the Game Boy Micro, I don't really get that either with the whole faceplate customization.
2762237	2765258	It seems to be this interesting trend, but okay, whatever.
2765298	2768180	It may not be for me, but some people are into this whole customize.
2768220	2771041	You know, if people customize their car, they might want to customize their consoles.
2771061	2771381	I don't know.
2771681	2775723	Well, if you're into faceplates, you can definitely pick some up for your most...
2776892	2777654	These are official.
2777674	2778395	These are official.
2778516	2778916	And they're,
2786970	2789251	Most faceplates are going to be about $14.90.
2789351	2806657	See, I don't know if I dig those, because the only one that's kind of cool is that first one in the picture where it's them dueling in the lava from Episode 3, but the other ones, like the one that looks inspired by the classic Star Wars films, all the controller ports and stuff are running through the people's faces, so you can't even really see clearly what it is.
2808678	2811078	Is Black Rain coming down on the Star Wars cast?
2811098	2812139	Because it's hard to see.
2812679	2813039	I don't know.
2813399	2821864	The other things that they have are World of Worlds themed stuff, Adidas, MTV's G-Spot, just a bunch of weird shit.
2822364	2824545	But that's all going to be available at some point.
2824985	2827887	I'm sure you'll see these in your major retail stores.
2827987	2830788	I think I'll stick with the standard white faceplate.
2830868	2832089	No, I like the idea of faceplates.
2832249	2836792	They showed a Project Gotham Racing 3 one, maybe included with a special edition of the game.
2837172	2839133	That might be something cool to give away, but...
2839980	2842101	I'm not going to spend $15 to buy something.
2842542	2846624	Especially if I'm going to buy a faceplate, it's going to be a blank one that I can design myself.
2846684	2847645	And you know there's going to be a website.
2847665	2850727	You know there's a Star Wars nut out there that can't wait to spend the $15 on this.
2850767	2857211	Well, these are the same people who buy those Star Wars themed Alienware PCs because they have the Star Wars stuff on the side.
2859272	2862254	Anyways, moving on from there.
2862774	2865376	The other thing is, this week actually...
2866607	2876251	Newsweek interviewed Miyamoto talking about what we can look forward to see in the revolution and where he sees gaming going from there.
2876931	2890916	One of the comments that he made, though, was saying that he always envisioned that the console games would break out of the on-screen type of thing and basically fill up an entire room.
2891096	2895318	You made a very interesting blog post about this, so you kind of came to a conclusion from this, huh?
2896175	2896355	Well...
2924372	2940900	Robert Rodriguez and Peter Jackson, all of them were saying, I believe it was Robert Rodriguez that commented saying that you're going to be seeing these in the theaters in the next coming years, but one game company has beat us to it, to the market, but you're going to see these things rolling out of the theaters soon.
2942134	2947643	Well, from what I can tell so far, Xbox obviously is not going to have anything for it.
2947683	2949025	Sony doesn't have anything for it.
2949125	2956797	They've also demoed something on the GameCube that was at E3 a couple years ago showing a stereoscopic 3D plugin for it.
2957981	2958842	What do you think is going to be?
2959702	2964666	So that combined with Miyamoto's comment about off the screen.
2964946	2968929	He says that he wants it to basically take up the entire room.
2969269	2972712	And you think about that controller, which is a 3D controller.
2972992	2975674	And he said, this is all I can say about this at this time.
2976826	2978047	That's big.
2978248	2983874	To me, I think one of these things that they're going to announce, and I honestly think that everything about the revolution hasn't been said yet.
2984234	2989180	I know that they've got stuff up their sleeves that they haven't said yet because everyone's really excited about it.
2989360	2990702	I think that stereoscopic 3D as...
2991963	2992623	I just, as long as it's not...
3008388	3008949	Thanks for watching!
3026124	3034348	But I'm thinking... But again, I guess if I had the time to sit through Captain EO when I was a kid, which is similar in a way, I'd have the time for a game.
3034408	3037910	But I think though, I mean, Nintendo's known for gimmicky stuff.
3037990	3039531	Now granted, this is not really gimmicky.
3039551	3043513	This is like the next stage in what, you know, cinema and stuff's going to happen.
3044293	3046774	And you know... One step closer to a holodeck, really.
3047115	3053698	Seriously, and I would think a 3D mouse or a 3D controller like that, it makes sense.
3053898	3054078	That's
3055695	3057495	I'd be really surprised if they didn't do this.
3057555	3060457	And this really is making sense that this is the direction it's going to go.
3060537	3065019	And I think we're going to find out more once they've come up with these press conferences talking about it.
3065039	3071462	Because this right here, once the PlayStation 3 comes out and all that stuff, this is really going to set them apart.
3072082	3076884	Whether their specs may not be as powerful as the other systems, it's not going to matter anymore.
3076924	3079665	They're going to be in their own category.
3079705	3081826	They're just going to be set apart from everybody else.
3081866	3083267	Which would be revolutionary.
3084307	3089049	And I think it would put them back in the lead, basically.
3089529	3090990	Interesting theories.
3091130	3092490	We'll see if any of them come true.
3093011	3094271	Anything else for us tonight, Loki?
3094811	3097252	Well, that's pretty much what I've got.
3097272	3099053	That's all the important stuff I hit up on.
3099473	3102514	This month is going to be really crazy as far as games come in.
3102875	3104255	It's really a doozy.
3105196	3107997	Especially with next week, the week of the 14th.
3109482	3111023	There's way too much stuff coming out.
3111183	3112104	Way too much stuff.
3112364	3114066	And then you've got the 360 launch.
3114306	3115567	It's going to be a busy month.
3115607	3120351	Well, it's that time of year when we're getting into Christmas and stuff, so not a surprise.
3120552	3124295	Oh, and the other thing is Advent Children.
3124575	3125556	It was supposed to be on the 10th.
3126036	3128038	Date's still to be announced now, again.
3129079	3130720	That thing keeps getting pushed back further and further.
3130740	3135504	Because they have to think of a way to get people to buy the UMD or DVD now because everybody's pirated it off the internet.
3135685	3136806	Well, not everybody, but you know.
3138282	3146538	They definitely took a hit by that getting leaked out and everything Of course they shouldn't have released it in one place way before they released it in another I don't know, maybe that's just me
3147719	3150001	Anyway, just a couple more stories for you guys tonight.
3150021	3151602	I want to talk about Metal Gear Acid 2.
3152303	3157627	Now, you know, in the previous Metal Gear games, there's usually been some type of fan-based competition.
3157667	3164573	For instance, you could be a dog tag in Metal Gear Solid 2, or there was a camouflage design competition that they did for Metal Gear Solid 3.
3165193	3169377	Well, now what they're doing is a card creation competition for Metal Gear Acid 2.
3169837	3173520	So if you think you have a name for a card, an image file...
3173960	3175281	Thank you for watching!
3195294	3199859	Also check out Konami's site to design cards for Metal Gear Acid 2.
3200100	3202542	And some of them are going to turn up in the final game.
3202642	3205645	So those of you creative folks might want to go check that out.
3205946	3206947	That is pretty awesome.
3206967	3213174	I'm also glad to see that they're actually going to be bringing a Metal Gear Solid type game to the PSP.
3213234	3216697	It's not going to be just this Metal Gear Acid anymore, which is nice.
3217475	3220022	Alright, now last story for you guys tonight.
3221085	3222689	This is kind of interesting.
3222769	3225376	Usually we end with a funny story, but this is not a funny story.
3225416	3226379	This is just kind of one of those
3227338	3228778	Gaming Culture Stories.
3229999	3242681	There was actually in China, this is something that was being reported on Yahoo News China, there was a character in World of Warcraft, well not really a character because it was a human that was playing this of course, the name of the character was Snow Lee.
3243581	3248842	This person died after playing World of Warcraft for several days straight during a national holiday.
3249242	3251603	Well they had an online funeral service
3252243	3257848	to basically commemorate the week anniversary of this person passing away.
3258448	3263813	And what's very interesting is if you look at the screen capture, it's very solemn.
3263853	3271198	It just shows all these characters kind of sitting and it kind of looks like they're all bowing their heads and they're all in these very neat lines.
3271759	3272880	So it's kind of
3273936	3275797	I don't know, it's very sad to see.
3276298	3283603	But it's just very interesting to see the community coming together like that to honor somebody who is playing among them.
3283643	3290048	But it also just goes to show, please, please, game in moderation, especially with these MMOs.
3290168	3294050	Play for an hour, but then take a good 10-minute break.
3294171	3298173	Go outside, get some air, lift some weights, do something.
3298994	3300575	It doesn't always have to be 100% about the games.
3300655	3301756	It can be 90% about the games, you know.
3303993	3309498	And finally, where would we be in a podcast without mentioning Jack Thompson?
3310779	3312661	Oh, just when I thought it was over.
3313061	3314242	No, okay.
3314343	3323451	So what's going on is there's a homicide case that's actually, of course, with a kid, and they're using the Grand Theft Auto as saying that's the thing.
3323851	3327394	Well, one of the parts that the defense is actually kind of...
3329154	3331335	I know this is really sophomoric, but only one word comes to mind right now.
3358123	3363647	So it's interesting, but sooner or later they're going to find out this guy's a quack.
3365628	3368530	Alright, that's going to do it for another edition of Orange Lounge Radio.
3368550	3371432	To go check out our website, by the way, www.orangeloungeradio.com
3372145	3373766	We look forward to seeing what you guys
3396077	3401959	Check that out and plot yourself on the map and show us what regional areas we should be covering more.
3402139	3407080	And also, this week I believe Jamie's going to the Podcast Awards.
3407100	3407941	Yes, she won't be here.
3407961	3409321	We touched on that a little earlier in the show.
3409361	3413602	She won't be here next week because of the Podcast Awards, but she'll be having fun.
3414163	3414963	I'm very envious.
3415763	3416003	Oh well.
3416583	3422225	But thanks to everybody out there who voted for us and loved us.
3422305	3422705	It was nice.
3423785	3424186	That's it.
3424526	3425266	Final thoughts, Loki?
3425882	3427904	We're going to be on the news on Tuesday.
3427964	3429465	Not we, you are.
3429525	3430806	I'm going to be on the news on Tuesday.
3430926	3433848	I hope they don't catch me saying something retarded.
3434269	3438652	I know that they've got me saying something stupid like it's so much fun.
3438772	3443476	I know you're going to give me a call that day to laugh at me.
3443536	3446018	I'm sure they'll be on a later show.
3446348	3446648	Check that.
3446688	3449709	There's more on the forums on that if you're curious about what's going on with all that.
3450169	3451970	Loki and DarkSakura being on the local news.
3453150	3459212	My final thought is I need zinc and vitamin C because I think I'm coming down with a cold.
3459832	3462433	And it's time to end this show because it's just making me sicker.
3463693	3464494	I get to be sick.
3465534	3468295	Thank you guys very much for listening and supporting Orange Lounge Radio.
3468335	3468955	We appreciate it.
3469235	3469815	Have a great week.
3469835	3471916	We'll see you next time on the Orange Lounge Radio To Go Edition.
3473112	3476678	That's the end of another Orange Lounge Radio To Go edition.
3476978	3482527	This podcast is a proud part of www.orangeloungeradio.com.
3482948	3483970	See you next update.
