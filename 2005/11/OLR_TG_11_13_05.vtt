Orange Lounge Radio To Go Edition, week of November 14th, 2005.

00:05.600 --> 00:09.400
You're tuned in to the Orange Lounge Radio To Go Edition,

00:09.400 --> 00:13.700
your podcast home for all the latest video game news and gamer chat.

00:13.700 --> 00:17.600
Now, here are your hosts, DarkSakura, Sky, and Logan.

00:18.800 --> 00:25.800
Hello, everybody! Once again, welcome to another episode of Orange Lounge Radio To Go,

00:25.800 --> 00:30.960
You're home from latest gaming news about video games that don't suck, all the news

00:30.960 --> 00:31.960
you really want to know about.

00:31.960 --> 00:35.820
You know, once in a while, though, we do have to talk about games that do suck, but just

00:35.820 --> 00:37.920
to remind you to avoid them.

00:37.920 --> 00:38.920
My name is Rob Roberts.

00:38.920 --> 00:39.920
You might know me as Skye.

00:39.920 --> 00:42.400
Joining me tonight, the one and only TecmasaLoki.

00:42.400 --> 00:43.880
Yep, it's me.

00:43.880 --> 00:45.400
How you doing?

00:45.400 --> 00:46.400
I'm doing good.

00:46.400 --> 00:50.440
All right, and DarkSakura, as we mentioned last week, she's been representing us at the

00:50.440 --> 00:54.840
podcast awards this weekend, so she is not able to be here with us tonight.

00:54.840 --> 00:57.380
She'll be back next week for sure.

00:57.380 --> 01:00.700
But she did pass along a special message for everyone, and we'll be reading that a little

01:00.700 --> 01:01.700
bit later.

01:01.700 --> 01:04.520
But we're going to start off tonight's show, and usually we start off with a little bit

01:04.520 --> 01:08.180
of How Was Your Gaming Week, but I want to change that a little bit tonight, because

01:08.180 --> 01:11.640
I just want to get this off my chest, because I've kind of been thinking about this quite

01:11.640 --> 01:17.740
a bit this week, and I think I've decided that I don't want to get an Xbox 360 on launch

01:17.740 --> 01:18.740
day anymore.

01:18.740 --> 01:22.880
Like, I was all hyped up about getting the Xbox 360 the day it was coming out on launch

01:22.880 --> 01:28.040
and I was ready to fight those lines at Best Buy and Target or wherever I decided to end

01:28.040 --> 01:30.680
up going, Toys R Us, which I think will probably be one of the best places, and now I'm just

01:30.680 --> 01:35.520
like, after reading about all these horrible, horrible delays, and reading about, now, Lokey,

01:35.520 --> 01:38.840
didn't your system get delayed, in fact? You were supposed to get one, you reserved it

01:38.840 --> 01:39.840
months ago?

01:39.840 --> 01:41.080
Yeah, but I have my theories on this too.

01:41.080 --> 01:44.960
Oh yeah, what do you think, before I continue to rant?

01:44.960 --> 01:48.520
My theory is that they're not going to be as short-handed as they think they are. I

01:48.520 --> 01:50.900
I think Microsoft purposefully told them

01:50.900 --> 01:52.780
they're getting less than they actually are.

01:52.780 --> 01:55.820
So, okay, you pre-ordered 200 for your store.

01:55.820 --> 01:57.980
They said, oh, well you're only gonna get 50,

01:57.980 --> 02:00.180
they actually ship you 100, or something like that.

02:00.180 --> 02:02.280
So, those people that thought that they weren't

02:02.280 --> 02:04.740
gonna get them, they got lucky and they got some,

02:04.740 --> 02:07.180
so Microsoft looks like the hero now,

02:07.180 --> 02:08.920
but still they're still cutting them short

02:08.920 --> 02:10.020
and they still sell out

02:10.020 --> 02:11.900
and there's still the media hype about it.

02:11.900 --> 02:15.500
Well, it's backfiring, because I was interested,

02:15.500 --> 02:16.700
but after hearing about all the shortness,

02:16.700 --> 02:18.540
Wait, do I really want to deal with this crap?

02:18.540 --> 02:21.500
Do I really want the system that badly at launch?

02:21.500 --> 02:24.140
And it kind of made me re-evaluate what games are

02:24.140 --> 02:26.620
coming out at launch after playing the kiosk and stuff.

02:26.620 --> 02:29.240
And sure, I'm not being anti-Microsoft with this

02:29.240 --> 02:29.620
statement.

02:29.620 --> 02:32.100
I will get an Xbox 360 eventually, but I'm just

02:32.100 --> 02:34.780
going, do I really want to buy into this launch hype?

02:34.780 --> 02:36.820
Is there any game that's coming out on launch day I

02:36.820 --> 02:37.740
really, really want?

02:37.740 --> 02:39.420
And I'm thinking to myself, you know what?

02:39.420 --> 02:41.020
No, there isn't.

02:41.020 --> 02:41.940
I mean, I can wait.

02:41.940 --> 02:43.900
I can wait until January or later.

02:43.900 --> 02:46.020
And come to think of it, there's very few systems that

02:46.020 --> 02:50.540
bought on launch. The last one was the Nintendo DS, but before that I can't really think of

02:50.540 --> 02:55.340
what system I probably bought on launch day. So, it can wait. But I know I've been kind

02:55.340 --> 02:58.060
of going back and forth on that for a while, so who knows. I reserve the right to change

02:58.060 --> 03:03.140
my mind before the official D-Day in what, like nine days or so? Where are we? Well,

03:03.140 --> 03:06.920
it depends on what day you're listening to this podcast, but you know, we're very little

03:06.920 --> 03:10.140
time left. But I'm just like, you know what, for all that money, especially if they're

03:10.140 --> 03:15.300
going to be pushing me to buy two games out the door and everything, and all this other

03:15.300 --> 03:16.640
accessory crap i'm just like you know

03:16.640 --> 03:18.480
what maybe push they're not going to

03:18.480 --> 03:21.560
require it and you know I have my own

03:21.560 --> 03:23.280
qualms with I've read about how they're

03:23.280 --> 03:24.720
going to be doing this whole thing at

03:24.720 --> 03:26.460
Best Buy and how they like want you to

03:26.460 --> 03:27.660
buy all this stuff and they're hoping

03:27.660 --> 03:29.460
they spend six hundred dollars at their

03:29.460 --> 03:30.240
store

03:30.240 --> 03:32.360
well the hell with them I had the

03:32.360 --> 03:34.680
remember those free Best Buy bucks they

03:34.680 --> 03:36.720
had the money for from McDonald's thing

03:36.720 --> 03:38.200
and all that wonderful stuff

03:38.200 --> 03:39.640
well I like about thirty one dollars of

03:39.640 --> 03:41.120
this stuff so I was going to go buy

03:41.120 --> 03:43.320
Shadow Colossus there and just say hey

03:43.320 --> 03:44.640
okay cool I get the game for like three

03:44.640 --> 03:51.480
bucks or whatever. No! You can only use three dollars on a game DVD or CD. I'm like where

03:51.480 --> 03:56.480
does it say that on this? Well it doesn't say on this. It's on the giant paper. I'm

03:56.480 --> 04:01.760
like what giant paper? Do they want to see the giant paper? It's like it almost made

04:01.760 --> 04:06.080
me think like I was going to go see the Wizard of Oz or something like that because you know

04:06.080 --> 04:09.920
oh he wants to see the giant paper? No not the giant paper. No one has to see the giant

04:09.920 --> 04:16.920
It's like, what the hell? So I basically went and got, you know, a spool of blank DVDs instead in the mall.

04:16.920 --> 04:21.920
Is this good enough for ya? No, that's fine. I'm like, shit, god.

04:21.920 --> 04:26.920
Then I went and spent my money elsewhere. But I did pick up shallow classes.

04:26.920 --> 04:29.920
Well don't derail my Xbox 360, dog. Sorry, sorry.

04:29.920 --> 04:33.920
That's probably what every gaming podcast is going to talk about this week is Xbox 360.

04:33.920 --> 04:36.920
But I'm going to say I'm probably not going to buy it.

04:36.920 --> 04:45.920
I've pretty much decided in my mind that my money is better spent on current Xbox, PlayStation 2, and GameCube games, and the 360 thing can wait until January.

04:45.920 --> 04:55.920
I'm just gonna... I have, like, what? Tons of games pre-ordered. I have four games pre-ordered right now, with a possible fifth being pre-ordered later this week because I have store credit.

04:55.920 --> 05:05.920
I'm going to be getting the games. In the system, I have a feeling I'm not going to be waiting that much longer, even if it is not launch day, which I still think it probably is going to be launch day.

05:05.920 --> 05:09.920
I'm still going to get one probably pretty soon, whenever they decide to ship more.

05:09.920 --> 05:16.920
So I'm not really that concerned about not being there. I don't want to wait in line in the morning.

05:16.920 --> 05:18.920
You know what if I I

05:19.840 --> 05:25.560
Let some kid who really wants the Xbox 360 for some game. They've got to freakin have on the day one

05:25.560 --> 05:27.480
You know what? I'm being nice

05:27.480 --> 05:32.760
I'm stepping aside because you don't want to see me with my claws out in the line waiting to get one of these systems

05:32.760 --> 05:38.160
So I'm being nice. I'm stepping aside. I will wait so one of you more eager kids can go get your Xbox

05:38.160 --> 05:39.560
Well, yeah a nice thing

05:39.560 --> 05:45.080
What game stuff told me as I have their pre-ordered mind back in May in order to get one that's before

05:45.080 --> 05:50.280
Or, you know, they even announced the price point or anything for the system.

05:50.280 --> 05:54.040
That'd be like me booking the revolution right now, which I should probably go do anyway

05:54.040 --> 05:55.360
since, you know...

05:55.360 --> 05:58.840
Seriously, if I want a revolution on launch day, maybe I ought to go pre-book that now.

05:58.840 --> 06:02.400
I'm worried I'm not going to get Mario Kart DS on Tuesday, because it seems like everybody

06:02.400 --> 06:04.360
and their sister wants that game.

06:04.360 --> 06:05.360
Mine's already working.

06:05.360 --> 06:06.360
Crazy.

06:06.360 --> 06:09.520
Um, I do want to mention this before, I mean this is a little bit of a news story, but

06:09.520 --> 06:12.920
it's kind of some late breaking news that's coming in as we are taping, because we tape

06:12.920 --> 06:15.920
on Sunday nights, and we're getting this story.

06:15.920 --> 06:20.640
It's actually coming off of Joystick with Q.com, and they're saying that Circuit City

06:20.640 --> 06:24.940
is advertising on their website, and you can actually see this on their website, CircuitCity.com,

06:24.940 --> 06:29.760
that they will be selling 360s on Friday at 2 p.m. Eastern Standard Time.

06:29.760 --> 06:34.380
Now, of course, the initial thought when you see this is, okay, they're going to sell it

06:34.380 --> 06:40.160
on their website, and you order it on the website, and they'll ship it to you by Tuesday

06:40.160 --> 06:41.160
or something, right?

06:41.160 --> 06:45.060
they're really breaking the launch day, but the weird thing is that this article

06:45.060 --> 06:48.780
says they actually called the customer service line and they spoke to a

06:48.780 --> 06:52.660
customer service rep and they're saying that every physical Circuit City

06:52.660 --> 06:56.420
location will be selling the console this Friday at 2 p.m. Eastern and just

06:56.420 --> 07:00.980
to be sure they called back and double-checked just to make sure that

07:00.980 --> 07:04.260
they indeed were selling this and they said yes it will be available this

07:04.260 --> 07:09.740
Friday at 2 p.m. Eastern Time online as well as at our stores. So our thought was

07:09.740 --> 07:13.280
we'll call our local Circuit City in check, but unfortunately since we taped Sunday night

07:13.280 --> 07:19.520
and it's about 8.40 now, we missed the boat, because they closed at 8, so we didn't get

07:19.520 --> 07:20.520
a chance to call.

07:20.520 --> 07:23.340
Did people still shop at Circuit City?

07:23.340 --> 07:28.340
I bought my video card there, they're still a fine store.

07:28.340 --> 07:29.340
Last thing I bought...

07:29.340 --> 07:30.880
Crappy location in this area.

07:30.880 --> 07:34.780
Just to give you some reference, the last thing I bought at Circuit City was your Game

07:34.780 --> 07:35.780
Cube.

07:35.780 --> 07:38.980
Wow, that was a long time ago, that was a Christmas present like three years ago?

07:38.980 --> 07:43.980
Long time ago. No, I had my car alarm installed in Circuit City. They're still around.

07:43.980 --> 07:47.980
Well, I shouldn't be giving them a free plug, but they do the free installation and everything, so...

07:47.980 --> 07:49.980
Well, I don't know.

07:49.980 --> 07:54.980
If I really didn't have one pre-ordered and already paid for, I might go look there, but I don't care.

07:54.980 --> 07:59.980
I don't know. I have a feeling this might change by Monday, Tuesday, when you guys are actually hearing this podcast,

07:59.980 --> 08:06.980
but this is something that's late-breaking, so keep an eye on CircuitCity.com if you want to try and beat the rush, so to speak.

08:06.980 --> 08:10.620
Although, you know, with every gaming site reporting this, who knows, everybody and their

08:10.620 --> 08:15.620
sister is probably going to be lining up to get an Xbox 360 on Friday from Circuit City.

08:15.620 --> 08:19.860
That's going to be a lot of interesting phone calls, if it isn't true.

08:19.860 --> 08:24.440
Anyway, let's do a little bit of how is your gaming week, what games you've been playing

08:24.440 --> 08:25.900
this week, and what you're up to.

08:25.900 --> 08:27.620
Loki, you mentioned Shadow of the Colossus?

08:27.620 --> 08:30.460
Yes, I was playing that today.

08:30.460 --> 08:36.220
I've gotten through already six of the Colossus's, and I think there's only 12, and it only took

08:36.220 --> 08:41.200
two hours and it wasn't that hard but I mean you think there might be like a

08:41.200 --> 08:45.460
hidden ending or a hidden level like like Symphony of the night upside down castle

08:45.460 --> 08:48.460
type thing well I know you can play through it more times and I think there

08:48.460 --> 08:52.220
are some stuff you unlock and I know there's a harder difficulty and stuff

08:52.220 --> 08:56.620
like that so there's more of that and the only thing that really kind of

08:56.620 --> 09:00.160
peeves me about this game is you're actually kind of fighting two enemies at

09:00.160 --> 09:05.140
the same time the Colossus and the camera because the camera does not want

09:05.140 --> 09:09.980
to freaking focus on anything correctly. I have to constantly control it with the right

09:09.980 --> 09:14.920
analog stick while trying to fight this thing. And there's a button to focus in on the colossus

09:14.920 --> 09:20.660
kind of like... it reminds me of Mega Man Legends where you can target stuff and that

09:20.660 --> 09:26.940
works really well. This does not work very well. Also, I get lost quite a bit trying

09:26.940 --> 09:30.540
to figure out where the hell I'm supposed to be going in this game. And there's really

09:30.540 --> 09:35.860
nothing else you know running around in the environment other than the environment looking

09:35.860 --> 09:41.480
really beautiful pretty much you know you kill colossus you come back to this temple

09:41.480 --> 09:46.260
thing to tell you what colossus you have to fight next you go find it kill it and you

09:46.260 --> 09:52.220
know wash rinse and repeat it's just i don't know but it's a good game i mean there's some

09:52.220 --> 09:56.140
pretty amazing stuff like i fought one that was like an eagle type thing so i had to grab

09:56.140 --> 10:02.580
onto this thing and fly around and that wasn't too fun, but I managed to do it and also fall

10:02.580 --> 10:07.220
off of it numerous times into water and get very pissed off yelling at the TV.

10:07.220 --> 10:08.220
But I don't know.

10:08.220 --> 10:09.220
It was a really fun game.

10:09.220 --> 10:12.020
Well it sounds like it's a game you can really get into then.

10:12.020 --> 10:13.740
Sometimes yelling at the TV makes a really good game.

10:13.740 --> 10:18.320
Well I was frustrated because I'm trying to grab ahold of this one part of it and it keeps

10:18.320 --> 10:21.540
grabbing some other part of it and I'm like, son of a bitch!

10:21.540 --> 10:23.540
Do what I want you to do!

10:23.540 --> 10:28.380
And so, that was kind of annoying, but then, I don't know, I'll probably play through it

10:28.380 --> 10:31.260
and be done with it, and that's it.

10:31.260 --> 10:34.060
The other game I've been playing is Grand Theft Auto Liberty City Stories.

10:34.060 --> 10:39.060
I've been playing this twice a day, a break, and kicking the crap out of my co-workers.

10:39.060 --> 10:43.580
I am fucking awesome with the rocket launcher.

10:43.580 --> 10:44.980
Just no competition.

10:44.980 --> 10:47.500
I'm tempted to check that out.

10:47.500 --> 10:51.180
I've not been that into Grand Theft Auto.

10:51.180 --> 10:55.120
I understand why it does so well critically and commercially, but

10:55.120 --> 10:58.580
for me personally it's not really my kind of game. But I am kinda tempted to

10:58.580 --> 11:01.940
check out this PSP one if for no other reason I need more games for my PSP.

11:01.940 --> 11:05.560
Um, the multiplayer is the best part. I love it. And this

11:05.560 --> 11:08.760
should have been something they really had in all of them. I think

11:08.760 --> 11:12.160
this is something that should have been in San Andreas,

11:12.160 --> 11:16.880
Vice City, because it's really fun and it's even another reason to buy the game.

11:16.880 --> 11:17.700
And

11:17.700 --> 11:21.560
I mean just do it with the amount of players that you can do it in the PSP like six or

11:21.560 --> 11:23.120
eight players you know or whatever

11:23.120 --> 11:27.140
and just have it online and be able to play that way I think it'd be really fun and you can

11:27.140 --> 11:29.340
get some really good tournaments and stuff going along

11:29.340 --> 11:34.520
I'm hopefully in the next reiteration of this which is coming out exclusively on

11:34.520 --> 11:35.440
the PS3

11:35.440 --> 11:39.560
will have something multiplayer on it because I think it really needs it or

11:39.560 --> 11:41.280
even two player co-op would be awesome

11:41.280 --> 11:45.360
Good ideas. So anything else you've been playing besides those two?

11:45.360 --> 11:52.360
That's it. I've got a lot of stuff lined up for this week, but that's about it. I've got Gun and Matrix.

11:52.360 --> 11:53.360
Sounds good. Path of Neo?

11:53.360 --> 11:53.860
Yeah.

11:53.860 --> 11:55.360
I've heard some good things about that game.

11:55.360 --> 12:02.860
Looks good. Then there's more stuff coming out this week, I know, or it'll be Need for Speed Most Wanted is coming out.

12:02.860 --> 12:07.860
I can already tell you, UltraMix 3 is out this week, and Mario Kart DS.

12:07.860 --> 12:08.860
Yeah, I'm getting DS'd.

12:08.860 --> 12:14.860
Honestly, I mean, have no time to dance with Mario Kart DS out. I mean, everybody's hyping this game.

12:14.860 --> 12:21.860
If it's the letdown Double Dash was, I'm gonna be pissed, but they're saying they did not screw with the formula this time, so...

12:21.860 --> 12:29.860
They redid the, um, the, um, what was it, multiplayer, um, stuff, but it's good. The stuff that they did with it is really good, so...

12:29.860 --> 12:30.860
We'll see.

12:30.860 --> 12:33.860
And the fact that we can play online, oh hell yes.

12:33.860 --> 12:39.860
We'll see, we'll see. I'm excited. This is, you know, this is a very interesting week if you think about it.

12:39.860 --> 12:44.940
this is a huge week in that this is almost epic in that this is where

12:44.940 --> 12:46.740
Nintendo is finally

12:46.740 --> 12:50.260
embracing online and granted I mean you could

12:50.260 --> 12:55.500
you know get me on a little loopholes like you know a fantasy star online for

12:55.500 --> 12:57.700
the GameCube but let's face it that was a Sega game

12:57.700 --> 13:01.260
was established before the GameCube you could say you know that stuff that was

13:01.260 --> 13:04.340
in Japan with the fancy Zelda and F-Zero tracks and stuff

13:04.340 --> 13:07.340
those little things aside this is really the first like true

13:07.340 --> 13:11.180
embracing of online that Nintendo's doing that we're gonna see this week with

13:11.180 --> 13:12.160
Mario Kart DS.

13:12.160 --> 13:15.180
That's a big ass deal to me, seeing as that

13:15.180 --> 13:18.860
I think one of the places where the GameCube could have done a lot better

13:18.860 --> 13:19.820
was with

13:19.820 --> 13:22.820
online support. I think the GameCube would have been a more successful and threatening

13:22.820 --> 13:24.580
system if they'd been online, but

13:24.580 --> 13:27.900
you know, some folks differ with me there, but I think...

13:27.900 --> 13:30.980
I'm still waiting for their announcement on December 9th.

13:30.980 --> 13:35.820
December 9th, folks, this is the day before the Japanese launch of the 360. They're

13:35.820 --> 13:37.720
they're gonna drop a bomb, so...

13:37.720 --> 13:38.720
We'll see.

13:38.720 --> 13:39.720
You know, we have a...

13:39.720 --> 13:40.720
Well, because last...

13:40.720 --> 13:44.360
For those of you guys that heard last week's show, Loki made his case for why he thinks

13:44.360 --> 13:48.200
the big revolution is stereoscopic 3D, and I think I have something tonight that's gonna

13:48.200 --> 13:49.760
even add to that case.

13:49.760 --> 13:50.760
We'll get there in a little bit.

13:50.760 --> 13:51.760
But first I want to talk about my gaming week.

13:51.760 --> 13:52.760
Go ahead.

13:52.760 --> 13:56.500
I've been promising to talk about Taito Legends for like three weeks now, and now I will finally

13:56.500 --> 13:59.720
say something about Taito Legends, which I checked out on the Xbox.

13:59.720 --> 14:01.160
Not a bad deal for 20 bucks.

14:01.160 --> 14:05.380
There's some really rock solid games that you love in this collection.

14:05.380 --> 14:10.140
Bubble Bobble, Rainbow Islands, two games I remember, Elevator Action, of course, that

14:10.140 --> 14:14.700
game was badass as well, Space Invaders, lots of cool retro games, but of course for all

14:14.700 --> 14:18.740
the cool retro games there's a lot of weird crap in there as well, like stuff I'd never

14:18.740 --> 14:23.580
really heard of, kind of filler, if you will, nothing else, but you know for 20 bucks it's

14:23.580 --> 14:27.120
not a bad deal, and sometimes that filler can be a good thing, like there was one particular

14:27.120 --> 14:32.720
game in there, I want to say it was New Zealand Story, and it was something I'd never really

14:32.720 --> 14:36.360
played before. I'd heard of it, but I'd never really played it before, and it was actually

14:36.360 --> 14:39.500
kind of a cool game, like it was one of those things where I was like, oh, I wish I knew

14:39.500 --> 14:42.640
about this when it was the arcades, but it was probably a small game. So some little

14:42.640 --> 14:47.000
gems in there as well, so if you're into the retro collection thing, a lot of good games

14:47.000 --> 14:50.800
for 20 bucks, I would recommend it for you. If you're not into the retro collections,

14:50.800 --> 14:54.680
nothing here is going to win you over, but you know, arcade perfect bubble bobble on

14:54.680 --> 14:58.880
your console, it's pretty cool, you know, unless you're already into the main thing,

14:58.880 --> 15:01.960
Come on, support these guys a little bit. It's 20 bucks! Not that bad.

15:01.960 --> 15:05.840
So, I know, that was a little short review of Title Legends, but what else can I

15:05.840 --> 15:08.940
really say about it? And another game I got to check out, I went to a little party

15:08.940 --> 15:10.680
yesterday for a web forum I'm on,

15:10.680 --> 15:14.720
and got to check out some new games at this party. Mario Party 7 being one of

15:14.720 --> 15:15.060
them.

15:15.060 --> 15:18.720
And I don't even know if I can really review Mario Party 7. I mean, what the hell

15:18.720 --> 15:19.600
can I say about it?

15:19.600 --> 15:25.920
You've seen 4, 5, 6 on the GameCube, and 3, 2, 1 before that on the Nintendo 64.

15:25.920 --> 15:29.540
yeah it is a player's that was the first is we actually played innate player game

15:29.540 --> 15:33.740
and use half the controller in the eight player game like you and a friend hold

15:33.740 --> 15:35.320
on see have to get you know close quarters

15:35.320 --> 15:38.640
but a una friend each hold half the controller and when you

15:38.640 --> 15:42.060
uses the sea stick there will be yellow sea stick in the right trigger

15:42.060 --> 15:45.620
and the other person uses the left analog controller in the left blocker

15:45.620 --> 15:48.940
so works out you do you know a player and you can do teams around-the-board

15:48.940 --> 15:51.240
we even did an eight-player gamer on the board and

15:51.240 --> 15:55.280
myself and explain half one of course I am very much

15:55.280 --> 15:56.800
Princess Peach?

15:56.800 --> 16:00.920
Hell yes, as always, Princess Peach and uh... Nick Latov was toad, so...

16:00.920 --> 16:02.160
it worked out.

16:02.160 --> 16:03.440
We kicked butt.

16:03.440 --> 16:05.440
Uh, anyway, but

16:05.440 --> 16:06.960
those guys are probably pissed off at me.

16:06.960 --> 16:08.960
Uh, anyway, no, we had a good time.

16:08.960 --> 16:12.360
I mean, honestly, I don't know what else I can say about it. You know if you like

16:12.360 --> 16:15.460
these kind of Mario Party games, I don't think they make very good single-player

16:15.460 --> 16:16.360
games at all.

16:16.360 --> 16:18.520
So if you're the type of person that games by yourself,

16:18.520 --> 16:21.480
I don't think there's a whole lot here for you, although there are single-player

16:21.480 --> 16:23.000
modes.

16:23.000 --> 16:29.000
You know what? There are some pretty cool mini-games. There was a couple cool puzzle mini-games in it.

16:29.000 --> 16:37.000
This one where there were these balls that were falling. It kind of reminded me of this old ass arcade game I used to play at Golf Land called Battle Balls.

16:37.000 --> 16:42.000
Did you ever remember this game? It was like a Japanese import game where it had these marbles that were falling and you had to stack them.

16:42.000 --> 16:46.000
It was kind of like, I don't know, I can't even explain it. It was like a Tetris type game.

16:46.000 --> 16:52.000
Well, they have something like that in this, except it's a rotating sphere that you let the balls fall into.

16:52.000 --> 16:55.940
fall into. So there's some kind of cool minigames. So you know what? I think there would be some

16:55.940 --> 17:00.740
cool stuff in here if you are a single player, you know, but to get the full potential of

17:00.740 --> 17:03.460
this game, you've got to be the type of person that has friends over a lot, or you've got

17:03.460 --> 17:06.740
a big family, so there's always somebody there to play the game with you. I think you'd get

17:06.740 --> 17:10.700
more value out of it that way. But it does seem to be a better Mario Party game than

17:10.700 --> 17:16.860
the last couple I played. I didn't particularly enjoy 5 or 6 as much as 4, although most other

17:16.860 --> 17:21.100
people I've talked to say that 4 is the weakest. That wasn't my personal opinion, but 7 is

17:21.100 --> 17:24.740
pretty solid entry so if you've kind of been lagging on the Mario Party series

17:24.740 --> 17:27.220
7 is a good one to come back to and it does have the microphone support again.

17:27.220 --> 17:31.980
Another game I checked out was Karaoke Revolution Party which I'd

17:31.980 --> 17:34.780
played a little bit at E3 but I got to see the full release of the game and

17:34.780 --> 17:38.200
again this is one of those games where I don't really see the value in it if

17:38.200 --> 17:41.940
you're going to be playing by yourself unless you want to practice singing

17:41.940 --> 17:45.260
because it's a darn good way to see like if you're tone deaf or not with

17:45.260 --> 17:48.780
Karaoke Revolution because if you're not familiar with this game basically it

17:48.780 --> 17:52.220
it shows you the lyrics on screen like regular karaoke, but it scrolls by

17:52.220 --> 17:56.140
and there's pitch bars and you actually sing into either your... now this is out

17:56.140 --> 17:58.500
on multiple systems, it's out on all the major systems

17:58.500 --> 18:02.380
but the version I played was on Xbox, and you can actually use your Xbox Live headset

18:02.380 --> 18:06.500
as a microphone, but the game also has a bundle that comes with a

18:06.500 --> 18:08.060
you know, holding microphone if you want

18:08.060 --> 18:11.400
but it actually gauges your pitch as a little arrow so you can see exactly, you

18:11.400 --> 18:13.860
know, if you're tone deaf the game will tell you, you know, honestly

18:13.860 --> 18:16.500
how you're doing.

18:16.500 --> 18:19.740
So that's kind of how it works. So I could see maybe a little bit of single player value

18:19.740 --> 18:21.900
and that you know you want to be a better singer but

18:21.900 --> 18:25.740
this is really more the kind of thing where you know again if you have people

18:25.740 --> 18:28.660
around a lot, you're an entertainer type with your video games,

18:28.660 --> 18:31.980
you'd probably get a lot of value out of Karaoke Revolution Party because I'll tell you

18:31.980 --> 18:33.620
at this party it was a hit.

18:33.620 --> 18:35.620
Everybody got on there and was doing the

18:35.620 --> 18:39.980
random medley, because you can do little medleys of five songs and just do random.

18:39.980 --> 18:41.800
So random songs would come up.

18:41.800 --> 18:45.060
And the interesting thing about Karaoke Revolution Party is that the song list

18:45.060 --> 18:49.800
is very eclectic. There really is something for everyone, which is a strong point and

18:49.800 --> 18:54.840
a weak point, because the fact that there's something for everyone means that you really

18:54.840 --> 18:58.880
only really, really like five or six songs on the list, and then the rest are kind of

18:58.880 --> 19:03.720
like, oh, I know that song, oh, I know that song. It didn't really focus on one genre.

19:03.720 --> 19:07.680
What I think is interesting about the Xbox version is that you can expand the song list

19:07.680 --> 19:13.320
via Xbox Live. There are 100 songs available on Xbox Live for download, and you can either

19:13.320 --> 19:18.260
download a block of five songs in a genre for five dollars each or you can

19:18.260 --> 19:22.100
download the whole shebang all one hundred songs for eighty bucks

19:22.100 --> 19:24.420
holy crap i don't know who'd want to spend eighty bucks that you have to be

19:24.420 --> 19:28.460
a hell that's really good yeah i mean there's a lot of expansiveness to this

19:28.460 --> 19:29.580
game so

19:29.580 --> 19:33.340
certainly the song list will not grow stale

19:33.340 --> 19:38.140
you're gonna have to spend eighty maybe a hundred dollars to really expand it

19:38.140 --> 19:41.460
but you know if you're willing to spend five dollars here five dollars there

19:41.460 --> 19:44.220
you can at least buy the genres, because at least it breaks it out into genres.

19:44.220 --> 19:46.140
You could buy like, okay, if I want to buy all the rock

19:46.140 --> 19:47.940
packs, that would be like ten dollars.

19:47.940 --> 19:50.100
You know, if you're more of a rock music fan. So that's...

19:50.100 --> 19:52.000
okay, that's cool.

19:52.000 --> 19:55.240
I would recommend Karaoke Revolution.

19:55.240 --> 19:58.340
Again, this is one of those games where you already know if this game is for you.

19:58.340 --> 20:01.540
It is definitely the strongest Karaoke Revolution title to date

20:01.540 --> 20:04.420
because, you know, there's been three other volumes released. This one has

20:04.420 --> 20:07.660
create a character, this one has the sing and dance mode,

20:07.660 --> 20:11.180
and both of those just really add to what was already a really, you know,

20:11.180 --> 20:15.500
unique game, so definitely the strongest entry in the series so far. Check it out

20:15.500 --> 20:20.140
if you're a fan of the music games. And so those are the games I checked out

20:20.140 --> 20:25.460
this week. Cool. Alright, let's move on to some gaming news. What's going on in the

20:25.460 --> 20:30.380
gaming world? Let's talk about the Xbox 360. You know, we're talking about that

20:30.380 --> 20:34.860
little bit at the start of the show, and I'm sure you guys are sick of Xbox 360

20:34.860 --> 20:38.840
dominating the news and everything, but let's face it, it's out in like 10 days, so we

20:38.840 --> 20:40.360
have to talk about it

20:40.360 --> 20:44.720
compatibility list finally released over xbox dot com exactly which games

20:44.720 --> 20:48.840
they will be backwards compatible supporting and yes it is apparently

20:48.840 --> 20:53.280
going to be using an emulator type thing because only about two hundred titles or

20:53.280 --> 20:58.400
so are emulatable so well so far so far they say they are going to expand to it

20:58.400 --> 21:01.760
but you do notice a couple things that are missing right off the bat such as

21:01.760 --> 21:04.000
dance dance revolution ultra mix

21:04.000 --> 21:07.800
uh... some of the other things such as uh... i notice midway arcade treasures

21:07.800 --> 21:09.220
wasn't on there

21:09.220 --> 21:13.760
and some of the other like older Xbox titles. There's some weird stuff on that list that's all I

21:13.760 --> 21:17.160
gotta say. But most, you know what, and I know a lot of people are saying this

21:17.160 --> 21:18.680
like why is

21:18.680 --> 21:24.040
Barbie on the list and uh... you know these aliens versus predator and some of

21:24.040 --> 21:26.560
these games that weren't standards you know you have

21:26.560 --> 21:30.260
this alongside Halo 2, Halo, Fable

21:30.260 --> 21:35.800
you know all the games, Ninja Gaiden and all the games you would expect Xbox

21:35.800 --> 21:40.060
360 to be emulating. My thought is, is like

21:40.060 --> 21:43.800
if you are familiar with emulating of games at all, like

21:43.800 --> 21:47.420
for instance take Nintendo emulation, there's like

21:47.420 --> 21:52.280
I think, and please don't quote me on this, but I think there's like 13 common

21:52.280 --> 21:53.160
mappers

21:53.160 --> 21:56.720
and like maybe a hundred not so common mappers and once you can get

21:56.720 --> 22:00.520
one of the maps to work in your emulator, usually you can get all the games that work

22:00.520 --> 22:01.240
on that map

22:01.240 --> 22:05.180
to work in the emulator, you know what I mean? Okay, yeah. So I think it's kind of like a

22:05.180 --> 22:08.420
a similar thing with this like once you get one type of game to work you

22:08.420 --> 22:10.660
probably get a whole bunch of them to work if that's what they're doing is the

22:10.660 --> 22:14.620
emulation so that's probably why you see games like Barbie in here because you

22:14.620 --> 22:18.260
know maybe by getting Ninja Gaiden to emulate it took five seconds to get

22:18.260 --> 22:21.900
support for Barbie whereas a game like Ultra Mix or something will probably

22:21.900 --> 22:25.780
take a little more effort that's my thought so that's why I'm not freaking

22:25.780 --> 22:29.220
out about this the stuff that they picked to be on this list because

22:29.220 --> 22:32.020
obviously they went for their standards and they just haven't gotten around to

22:32.020 --> 22:37.540
rest of it yet. But another question was answered and that was, if I bought

22:37.540 --> 22:41.660
something, if I bought premium content on the Xbox, will I be able to transfer it

22:41.660 --> 22:46.540
over to the Xbox 360? No, you will not be able to transfer it to the Xbox 360. So

22:46.540 --> 22:51.780
don't shelve your Xbox console or sell it back just yet if you use your premium

22:51.780 --> 22:55.580
content that's on there because you will have to re-buy it on Xbox 360, at least

22:55.580 --> 23:00.140
that's what we're hearing right now. So far, I mean, that might change later,

23:00.140 --> 23:03.340
if they figure out a way to do certain things.

23:03.340 --> 23:04.620
I somehow don't think it will.

23:04.620 --> 23:08.420
Although, if you are a Dance Game fan, I did see on the list Pump It Up

23:08.420 --> 23:12.900
Exceed was on there, so that is one game you'll at least be able to play

23:12.900 --> 23:16.860
on the fewest. And I don't think that was Microsoft saying we prefer Pump It Up to

23:16.860 --> 23:19.160
DR or any of that crap, I think it's just again,

23:19.160 --> 23:22.140
you get one game to work and Pump It Up worked as well. There's no problem though.

23:22.140 --> 23:23.500
How are you going to play it on the dance pad?

23:23.500 --> 23:28.020
Oh! Damn! Good thought, good thought. Is it not the same controller ports?

23:28.020 --> 23:32.500
I assumed it was the same controller parts. I don't really research some of these things.

23:32.500 --> 23:34.540
There are no controller ports.

23:34.540 --> 23:37.620
What about... no, there's a wired controller that you get in one pack?

23:37.620 --> 23:39.440
USB.

23:39.440 --> 23:42.500
Oh, duh. That makes too much sense for my feeble brain.

23:42.500 --> 23:49.180
No, what they could do is a USB adapter, since the actual Xbox controllers are...

23:49.180 --> 23:50.020
I'm sure there's already...

23:50.020 --> 23:54.980
...modified USB. There's probably already an Xbox to USB so people could use those things on their computer.

23:54.980 --> 23:58.020
I'm not sure that the game would recognize and that's a problem

23:58.020 --> 24:02.340
but I don't know. I'm sure this stuff will come out later but

24:02.340 --> 24:05.740
at least it's available. You can play it on the controller.

24:05.740 --> 24:10.940
Alright, speaking of music games, we have a couple other music game news things I

24:10.940 --> 24:12.340
want to get to you guys.

24:12.340 --> 24:16.380
Beatmania, which is, you know, one of the first

24:16.380 --> 24:20.020
games that really kicked off the whole Bomani trend over at Konami.

24:20.020 --> 24:24.500
Beatmania USA is coming out. We have a release date for that and it's

24:24.500 --> 24:28.580
February 8th. Yep. So we're hearing is the release date for that and Loki you were the one that picked up on this, right?

24:28.580 --> 24:32.500
Yep, just came in on your calendar. That's what Konami sent over to us so far

24:32.700 --> 24:35.500
Of course, you know with the dates shuffling like crazy

24:36.300 --> 24:41.940
That could move but that's what they've given us so far and we actually have a solid date for it. So

24:42.820 --> 24:46.140
Who knows but tentative should be pretty cool

24:46.140 --> 24:51.340
And speaking of beat mania if you are the type that imports your beat mania from Japan like I did for a long time

24:51.340 --> 24:57.340
TenStyle is on its way out very, very soon. I think it's next week as well.

24:57.340 --> 25:04.340
TenStyle has the song list up, and what's very interesting is that there's a very interesting crossover in it.

25:04.340 --> 25:10.340
Jelly Kiss, Midihead's SmackMix from UltraMix 3 is crossing over into 2DX TenStyle,

25:10.340 --> 25:16.340
which is interesting because if you follow the music gaming forums, people have been saying that Midihead needs to be in 2DX for a long, long time.

25:16.340 --> 25:21.340
And you know the other footnote I have to this, Midihead is going to be on the show next week.

25:21.340 --> 25:25.340
We're going to have an interview with him, so I'm going to ask him exactly what he thinks about this.

25:25.340 --> 25:28.340
We'll have Midihead on next week's show.

25:28.340 --> 25:31.340
Let's see, what else is going on here in the gaming world?

25:31.340 --> 25:35.340
Let's talk about this, because this made me squeeze like a little fanboy.

25:35.340 --> 25:38.340
It was beautiful. I think I shed a tear over this.

25:38.340 --> 25:40.340
I forgave Squeenix over this.

25:40.340 --> 25:42.340
I'm going to sound like such a nerd, but I don't care.

25:42.340 --> 25:46.860
Kingdom Hearts 2. Did you see those pictures coming out of Famitsu magazine?

25:46.860 --> 25:50.460
I'm sorry, not Famitsu, I'm just kidding. Jump Magazine was the

25:50.460 --> 25:54.640
magazine that released this. Kingdom Hearts 2 characters

25:54.640 --> 25:57.580
in Tron outfits. Awesome.

25:57.580 --> 26:00.820
Meaning that Tron is a level in Kingdom Hearts 2.

26:00.820 --> 26:04.820
I forgive them for the delay. They show stuff from Tron. Yeah, they show screenshots and stuff.

26:04.820 --> 26:08.420
Great. That is very exciting. I do like seeing them

26:08.420 --> 26:14.300
crossover into these other non-animated movie genres and stuff like that like

26:14.300 --> 26:17.700
the Pirates of the Caribbean and that I think is a really good way... Did you hear about Steamboat

26:17.700 --> 26:21.260
Willy? Somebody at the party yesterday was telling me about Steamboat Willy is one of the

26:21.260 --> 26:26.180
stages too, I didn't know that. Retro Mickey or something, like old style. Yeah, old, old style.

26:26.180 --> 26:31.620
I think that's awesome and this is also another plea out there. Square Enix needs to

26:31.620 --> 26:37.100
get back with Nintendo and give us a real sequel to Super Mario RPG. I'm

26:37.100 --> 26:42.340
telling it because imagine this if you take this this kind of same style but

26:42.340 --> 26:45.980
with actual Nintendo games and the Nintendo characters and stuff and just

26:45.980 --> 26:49.420
make it like Nintendo RPG or something like that I would that I would like to

26:49.420 --> 26:52.620
give another plea over to Squeenix because I'm sure Kingdom Hearts 3 is

26:52.620 --> 26:55.980
inevitable and I would just like to issue a friendly reminder to Squeenix

26:55.980 --> 27:03.740
that Disney now has the license to the Muppets think about it thank you could

27:03.740 --> 27:07.020
be disastrous, but it could be the greatest thing ever as well.

27:07.020 --> 27:08.020
Think about it.

27:08.020 --> 27:09.020
That's all I'm asking.

27:09.020 --> 27:10.020
Think about it.

27:10.020 --> 27:14.480
All right, now of course I said we'd have a special message from the one and only Dark

27:14.480 --> 27:22.380
Sakura who went to the Podcast Awards this weekend, and if you didn't hear, over at podcastawards.com

27:22.380 --> 27:26.560
earlier this year they did some nominating and voting, and we somehow actually won the

27:26.560 --> 27:31.740
award for Best Gaming Podcast thanks to our awesome, awesome legion of fans, and so Dark

27:31.740 --> 27:37.140
Dark Sakura went down to LA this Friday to pick up that award, and she files this report.

27:37.140 --> 27:40.640
We were going to Skype her in tonight to talk about this, but unfortunately due to connection

27:40.640 --> 27:44.340
issues and just the fact that Dark Sakura is also really, really tired, she just sent

27:44.340 --> 27:48.660
this over to me over text messenger, so I'm going to read this to you guys right now,

27:48.660 --> 27:51.740
her little report from LA.

27:51.740 --> 27:52.740
She says,

27:52.740 --> 27:54.780
The drive to LA was a pain in the arse.

27:54.780 --> 27:58.380
I've had a nasty cold and it's proceeded to get worse during the trip.

27:58.380 --> 28:03.200
The next day was spent on homework and a two-hour drive to Ontario from Anaheim.

28:03.200 --> 28:06.080
An hour of that was spent on the five alone.

28:06.080 --> 28:09.480
Her friend Julie, Kasumi19, went with me on the adventure.

28:09.480 --> 28:14.560
We arrived and met up with Frank of The Overnightscape, a podcast out of New Jersey.

28:14.560 --> 28:18.260
He's a big gamer too, apparently, so we sat with him during the ceremony.

28:18.260 --> 28:22.520
We also met someone from madpod.com sat with us too.

28:22.520 --> 28:25.240
The issue when we tried to get in was that we didn't have badges.

28:25.240 --> 28:28.120
I said, we're Orange Lounge Radio, we won an award.

28:28.120 --> 28:31.320
They said, ìWill you be here tomorrow?î She said, ìNo.î And they said, ìFine, just

28:31.320 --> 28:34.320
go in.î

28:34.320 --> 28:39.360
Julie and her Dark Sakura helped themselves to the free food and they sat there mesmerized

28:39.360 --> 28:43.240
by Adam Curry, who apparently was standing just a foot away from their table.

28:43.240 --> 28:46.600
And I remember when I talked to Jamie on the phone, she didnít shut up about Adam Curryís

28:46.600 --> 28:48.000
hair, so I thought it was funny.

28:48.000 --> 28:51.660
And she would also like to say, ìFor the record, he still looks fabulous.î Anyway,

28:51.660 --> 28:56.180
they let the first three awards winners talk, one being Mr. Curry himself, and then the

28:56.180 --> 29:01.380
People's Choice winners went up, had pics taken, and got shooed off.

29:01.380 --> 29:08.220
We have a $25 Visa gift card and plastic trophy, pictures of which will be on the site soon.

29:08.220 --> 29:09.220
Woohoo!

29:09.220 --> 29:10.220
$25!

29:10.220 --> 29:12.860
That's a higher budget than we've ever had for this show.

29:12.860 --> 29:16.060
I thought we won some web design package or blog design.

29:16.060 --> 29:18.620
I have no idea.

29:18.620 --> 29:19.620
Did they chip us?

29:19.620 --> 29:21.060
Did they jack our prize?

29:21.060 --> 29:22.060
I don't care.

29:22.060 --> 29:23.060
Whatever.

29:23.060 --> 29:25.060
It's not a big deal.

29:25.060 --> 29:27.060
Uh, anyway, DarkStalker continues.

29:27.060 --> 29:31.060
After that, I mostly hung around talking to Frank and was interviewed for his podcast,

29:31.060 --> 29:34.060
so I feel inclined to give his, uh, podcast a plug.

29:34.060 --> 29:35.060
TheOvernightScape.

29:35.060 --> 29:38.060
www.TheOvernightScape.com

29:38.060 --> 29:42.060
He's awesome and his podcast was one of the nominees in the political social talk, I believe.

29:42.060 --> 29:43.060
Very cool guy.

29:43.060 --> 29:45.060
At any rate, that's it for me.

29:45.060 --> 29:47.060
I do have one bit of advice for the column tonight.

29:47.060 --> 29:50.060
Don't try to park on a hill in Julian, California,

29:50.060 --> 29:52.060
because it is friggin' impossible,

29:52.060 --> 29:53.060
and never trust directions.

29:53.060 --> 29:54.060
Ever.

29:54.060 --> 30:02.420
get a map! That from our very own DarkSakura who will be back next week and

30:02.420 --> 30:06.660
you know one more time and then we'll shut up about this awards thing just a

30:06.660 --> 30:09.240
big thank you to all our fans out there we also want to say thank you to the

30:09.240 --> 30:13.840
other nominees in the category because we were up against some awesome indie

30:13.840 --> 30:17.760
talent in the video gaming category so we want to say congratulations as well

30:17.760 --> 30:20.800
to the guys over at DreamStation.cc,

30:20.800 --> 30:23.760
Yankadank over at Gamers RadioCast,

30:23.760 --> 30:27.120
Industry Insider Gaming Steve and his podcast over there,

30:27.120 --> 30:30.260
as well as RPG MP3,

30:30.260 --> 30:33.840
world's largest dungeon audio review because they do awesome jobs on their

30:33.840 --> 30:34.880
podcasts as well.

30:34.880 --> 30:38.880
We are all independent and this is probably the only year where the nominees

30:38.880 --> 30:41.000
are going to read like that because I bet you next year

30:41.000 --> 30:44.560
with all the built-in audience that some of those corporate podcasts have, not to knock

30:44.560 --> 30:46.520
on the corporate podcasts, you know, they're doing a good thing for the

30:46.520 --> 30:51.160
community, 1UP and GameSpot and all them, but, you know, probably us indies are gonna

30:51.160 --> 30:54.520
have a harder time standing out next year, so, guys, we're gonna have to enjoy this

30:54.520 --> 30:55.520
while it lasts.

30:55.520 --> 31:00.160
So, congratulations to you guys as well for being nominated.

31:00.160 --> 31:02.500
But you know, how much Mountain Dew do you think it takes to get through the world's

31:02.500 --> 31:03.500
largest dungeon?

31:03.500 --> 31:04.500
That's what I'm curious about.

31:04.500 --> 31:07.680
I don't know, but they have that new energy drink now, so...

31:07.680 --> 31:08.680
That's true.

31:08.680 --> 31:16.280
And who was it, someone that we knew, it was a 48 hours, oh, VX, oh yeah, was that by 48

31:16.280 --> 31:19.280
Yeah, 48 hours with that stuff.

31:19.280 --> 31:20.280
I'm sure they drink a lot of that.

31:20.280 --> 31:22.280
I tease, because I love.

31:22.280 --> 31:25.280
Alright, moving on.

31:25.280 --> 31:28.280
This is something about Nintendo that's pissed me off for a long time.

31:28.280 --> 31:31.280
But this plays into something you were talking about last week.

31:31.280 --> 31:36.280
You know how I've been pissed off that Nintendo's not going to support the revolution.

31:36.280 --> 31:39.280
Nintendo's not going to support HD with the revolution.

31:39.280 --> 31:42.280
And as somebody who recently bought an HD TV, that kind of pissed me off.

31:42.280 --> 31:45.280
Because I wanted to see Nintendo kind of embrace the HD technology like everyone's doing.

31:45.280 --> 31:48.940
doing and there was kind of this they said this a long time ago but there were

31:48.940 --> 31:53.260
rumors just very recently that they were going back on this well here's the thing

31:53.260 --> 31:58.380
there was an interview on CNN money and they chatted with a Nintendo of America

31:58.380 --> 32:04.700
executive VP of sales and marketing Reggie Philz I'm a and he said that what

32:04.700 --> 32:09.780
will offer in terms of game gameplay and approachability will more than make up

32:09.780 --> 32:15.860
for the lack of HD. And I'm thinking, shit, this just buys into what Loki said last week

32:15.860 --> 32:21.260
about the stereoscopic 3D. It all makes sense. They can't do it on an HD TV, that's why they're

32:21.260 --> 32:27.240
not going to support it. Because then it goes on to say that when you have the HD support,

32:27.240 --> 32:31.140
you have really long loading times as well. And I kind of noticed that Halo kind of seems

32:31.140 --> 32:34.720
to load a little longer than it used to. I don't know, maybe it's just I'm insane, but

32:34.720 --> 32:38.500
it seems to have a slightly longer load time. I don't mind waiting a little bit longer for

32:38.500 --> 32:43.020
pretty games, but maybe this all buys into what you're- we'll find out!

32:43.020 --> 32:44.300
We'll find out early December.

32:44.300 --> 32:45.300
I think it'll be cool.

32:45.300 --> 32:46.300
We'll see.

32:46.300 --> 32:48.180
Loki, what do you have for us tonight?

32:48.180 --> 32:50.540
Um, a couple things.

32:50.540 --> 32:56.020
First thing will be kind of... let's see here.

32:56.020 --> 33:03.340
My favorite topic of discussion is how hackers have broken the PSP.

33:03.340 --> 33:07.700
And Sony's really having trouble with their copy protection stuff this week, you know,

33:07.700 --> 33:15.660
the whole CDDRM rootkit thing that they put out there and how not only is Microsoft pissed

33:15.660 --> 33:21.900
off at them and also California as a state is suing them and now the government's coming

33:21.900 --> 33:22.900
after them.

33:22.900 --> 33:29.620
Well, on top of all that, people have found a way to exploit the version 2.5 firmware.

33:29.620 --> 33:31.700
Sony, it's just not your day.

33:31.700 --> 33:32.700
It's just not your day today.

33:32.700 --> 33:34.220
It's just never going to happen.

33:34.220 --> 33:35.780
Listen, Sony, you've got to understand...

33:35.780 --> 33:37.180
Don't launch the PS3 right away.

33:37.180 --> 33:39.140
You might want to wait a little bit on that because you're not having good luck right

33:39.140 --> 33:40.140
now.

33:40.140 --> 33:46.840
You got to understand there's never ever going to be a way to fully 100% get the PSP to be

33:46.840 --> 33:48.940
able to not run homebrew.

33:48.940 --> 33:49.940
It's never going to happen.

33:49.940 --> 33:51.380
They seriously should just give up.

33:51.380 --> 33:56.940
I guess they have a moral responsibility to be patching this stuff, but honestly.

33:56.940 --> 34:01.700
Okay, well no downgrade has been released yet, but there's been a new exploit that's

34:01.700 --> 34:08.060
that's been put out there, where they've actually found a way to create a TIFF file to cause

34:08.060 --> 34:13.820
a buffer overflow the same way that they did it with version 2.0 firmware to be able to

34:13.820 --> 34:16.260
break it and run their own code.

34:16.260 --> 34:24.340
The other thing that's actually happened, and it was reported on psp3d.com I believe,

34:24.340 --> 34:29.580
they actually had a version of that exploit that they converted into a save file.

34:29.580 --> 34:36.500
So basically you load the save file either in a game or just in their save file browser

34:36.500 --> 34:39.340
thing there to actually be able to launch this.

34:39.340 --> 34:42.460
And there's a boot bin file where you can launch your own code.

34:42.460 --> 34:49.260
So in theory this should work to be able to run a down grader later on or something to

34:49.260 --> 34:50.420
that effect.

34:50.420 --> 34:55.660
Of course a new firmware update is expected and I believe the new thing that they're adding

34:55.660 --> 35:01.260
with the new firmware is going to be e-book reader. I actually saw the story on this.

35:01.260 --> 35:03.180
Okay, that's cool.

35:03.180 --> 35:08.340
Be interesting. I think it's kind of pointless. Maybe a web browser with, I don't know, Java

35:08.340 --> 35:12.200
support would be nice.

35:12.200 --> 35:16.500
So that's that. The other thing that was kind of cool is they were showing some screenshots

35:16.500 --> 35:20.500
of the Gradius collection that's going to be coming out.

35:20.500 --> 35:23.920
That's exciting. That's definitely a PSP game I got to pick up.

35:23.920 --> 35:31.660
So it's going to be nice, they showed both the pan and scan version of the old games

35:31.660 --> 35:34.980
and then the widescreen version, which is kind of neat.

35:34.980 --> 35:35.980
Very exciting.

35:35.980 --> 35:36.980
Yeah.

35:36.980 --> 35:39.220
Alright, let's go over to our mailbag and read a couple of emails that have come in

35:39.220 --> 35:40.580
to us this week.

35:40.580 --> 35:46.060
If you want to email us, togo at orangeloungeradio.com is the place to send those emails, togo at

35:46.060 --> 35:47.460
orangeloungeradio.com.

35:47.460 --> 35:51.560
And we might read your letter on the air, just like we're going to read these folks.

35:51.560 --> 35:57.440
email comes to us from the goo the self-proclaimed DDR King of

35:57.440 --> 36:02.800
Charlottesville Virginia well bow down to the DDR King hey guys love the

36:02.800 --> 36:07.800
podcast helps to make my workday fly by like I am high on drugs now I know you

36:07.800 --> 36:11.080
are all addicted to the Bahmani games as much as me and here is where you can

36:11.080 --> 36:15.840
flaunt your geekness and help me out all at the same time dance dance documentary

36:15.840 --> 36:19.840
Where or where do I find it? Help-a-honkey-out.

36:19.840 --> 36:25.840
You know, I googled it. I couldn't find it. I have no idea where you can get this movie.

36:25.840 --> 36:32.840
I was interviewed for some movie that they were doing on DDR, and I don't know if this is the same one or not.

36:32.840 --> 36:35.840
I think it was, and it never came to be.

36:35.840 --> 36:42.840
No, if you go to Internet Movie Database, you can actually see dance dance documentary on Internet Movie Database.

36:42.840 --> 36:45.880
and this is what I really want to talk about sorry buddy I don't know where you

36:45.880 --> 36:48.600
can get this movie because I have I cannot find a website where they are

36:48.600 --> 36:52.320
selling this movie but I was drawn to this entry on internet movie database

36:52.320 --> 36:56.440
because it actually has like a full entry here in a review and it's like

36:56.440 --> 37:00.200
what's going on does it show your name is one of the actors no but it shows

37:00.200 --> 37:04.260
other people that we know very well like Mel B and some of the other people in

37:04.260 --> 37:07.600
the community they're all listed here and they have internet movie database

37:07.600 --> 37:11.160
entries how cool is that like you could click on Mel here and get to his whole

37:11.160 --> 37:17.400
page, almost like he's a card-carrying member of the Screen Actors Guild now or something.

37:17.400 --> 37:20.720
That's kind of, I don't know, that cracked me up, as a long-time member of the Bomani

37:20.720 --> 37:22.440
community, this cracked me up.

37:22.440 --> 37:25.680
You know, and this, a lot of this was filmed at the Cyberbeat Nation tourney, which was

37:25.680 --> 37:30.540
this huge tournament years ago, and you and I were both there, so we might be in the background

37:30.540 --> 37:35.040
of this movie somewhere, if nothing else, but no internet movie database page for us

37:35.040 --> 37:36.040
yet.

37:36.040 --> 37:37.040
We'll see.

37:37.040 --> 37:41.040
of, you know, Orange Lunch Radio either. Very, very disappointing.

37:41.040 --> 37:45.040
That's alright. What kind of a documentary do you think it is if you don't get

37:45.040 --> 37:49.040
all sides of the topic? We didn't have a podcast at the time, because this came

37:49.040 --> 37:53.040
out in 2004, so we didn't have a podcast that time, so nobody cared then.

37:53.040 --> 37:57.040
Oh, okay. Even though we've been doing this for, you know, what, three and a half years?

37:57.040 --> 38:01.040
Let's go on to another email. We had another email.

38:01.040 --> 38:05.040
It's our buddy, Dekeman, saying, hi, I'm back from Canada

38:05.040 --> 38:08.300
Have just finished catching up on the last month or so worth of shows

38:08.300 --> 38:13.640
I heard you guys read out some release lists for the US and the UK but nothing for Australia

38:14.160 --> 38:18.600
So he sent us a link and you know checking out the frapper. You know we were plugging the frapper last week

38:18.600 --> 38:23.120
I didn't realize like every freaking podcast out there has a frapper because like now this week

38:23.120 --> 38:27.120
I'm looking at other sites and like put yourself on the frapper put yourself on the frapper

38:27.120 --> 38:31.740
I'm like oh wow we apparently jumped on this bag bandwagon real way late, but it's still cool

38:31.740 --> 38:36.880
So put yourself on the front for orange lounge, but looking at the frapper. We have some pins in Australia

38:36.880 --> 38:40.420
So we got to recognize our Aussie fan base. I don't like about the frappers

38:40.420 --> 38:43.820
I can't actually put myself where I live and said it's just city

38:43.820 --> 38:45.660
You don't want them to come to your house

38:45.660 --> 38:50.660
You know, you might have some you might have some very angry Mac owners and in the groove players that would come

38:50.660 --> 38:53.460
You know bring in. Yeah, whatever. Anyway, here's some things that are coming out in

38:54.500 --> 38:57.220
Australia I'm just gonna kind of read through this list real quickly here

38:57.220 --> 39:02.220
18th of November, NBA 2006 and NHL 2006

39:02.220 --> 39:05.220
coming out 24th November, Matrix Path of Neo

39:05.220 --> 39:07.220
also same day Soul Calibur 3

39:07.220 --> 39:12.220
coming out on 25th November, Shadow the Hedgehog and the Capcom Classics collection

39:12.220 --> 39:16.220
and then we go into the December, we have 1st of December

39:16.220 --> 39:19.220
you guys are getting WWE SmackDown vs. Raw

39:19.220 --> 39:21.220
which honestly I never really got into the wrestling games

39:21.220 --> 39:23.220
but I know some folks are into them so whatever

39:23.220 --> 39:27.220
Prince of Persia 3 Two Thrones on 8th of December, now that'll be pretty cool.

39:27.220 --> 39:30.220
Sega Classics Collection, you guys are finally getting on 10th of December.

39:30.220 --> 39:35.220
And then on into 2006, you guys will be getting Oz, which I don't even think we're getting here.

39:35.220 --> 39:39.220
You guys are getting that on 28th of February, so feel lucky about that one.

39:39.220 --> 39:42.220
And then on March 13th, you guys are getting Godfather.

39:42.220 --> 39:44.220
Of course, that all being on the PlayStation 2.

39:44.220 --> 39:46.220
You want to go to some other systems.

39:46.220 --> 39:51.220
Over in Australia, you guys are getting King Kong for the Xbox on 17th of November.

39:51.220 --> 39:56.220
Half-Life 2 on 21st of November, and if you go to some other systems such as the GameCube,

39:56.220 --> 40:02.220
Pokemon XD this week on 15th of November, and Fire Emblem Path of Radiance on 1st of

40:02.220 --> 40:07.220
December, and over on the DS you guys are getting Burnout Legends on the 12th of December,

40:07.220 --> 40:10.220
and Phoenix Wright, Ace Attorney, 28th of February.

40:10.220 --> 40:15.220
I like how sometimes they get games before us, like King Kong isn't here until the week

40:15.220 --> 40:16.220
of the 21st.

40:16.220 --> 40:21.580
first. Mm-hmm. Just interesting the way it works out sometimes. Yeah. So there

40:21.580 --> 40:26.340
you go. Can't say we don't love you guys down in Australia, so there you go. One

40:26.340 --> 40:32.100
other mail I wanted to read for you guys here. This one is coming from Edmund, and

40:32.100 --> 40:35.180
Edmund wanted to send us something about the Video Games Live, and you know, we

40:35.180 --> 40:39.220
were kind of, we were kind of, you know, dogging on Video Games Live a little bit.

40:39.220 --> 40:42.780
He wanted to send a positive review about Video Games Live, because unlike us,

40:42.780 --> 40:46.980
he actually got to go to the show in Vancouver, so he wants to share what was

40:46.980 --> 40:50.580
going on. He said the show was great, great sound, great lighting. The

40:50.580 --> 40:54.140
production values were great. Each piece was accompanied by game footage. It was

40:54.140 --> 40:57.460
an incredible combination. The show started with what they called classic

40:57.460 --> 41:01.420
arcade medley. This segment started with the primitive beeps and boops from games

41:01.420 --> 41:04.980
like Pong, Space Invaders, and Defender, and then transitioned into the games

41:04.980 --> 41:08.100
with some sorts of music in it like Donkey Kong. Okay, good, that doesn't sound

41:08.100 --> 41:11.220
as hokey as I thought that was gonna be, so I'm really glad that that is kind of,

41:11.220 --> 41:15.220
you know, was the way they opened. That sounds cool. Lastly, they played music

41:15.220 --> 41:19.220
from the classics with true orchestration like Dragon's Lair and Outrun.

41:19.220 --> 41:23.220
They proceeded to play music from games like Metal Gear Solid, Zelda,

41:23.220 --> 41:27.220
God of War, Beyond Good and Evil, Castlevania, Myst, Warcraft, Advent Rising,

41:27.220 --> 41:31.220
Halo, etc. The show was an astounding orchestral experience.

41:31.220 --> 41:35.220
I believe that both gamers and non-gamers would enjoy it equally. It's too bad that they had

41:35.220 --> 41:39.220
to cancel most of their shows. So, a positive review

41:39.220 --> 41:41.760
of the show coming to us from Edmond.

41:41.760 --> 41:43.300
Again, if you want to send us an email,

41:43.300 --> 41:46.740
togoatorangeloungeradio.com is the place to send it,

41:46.740 --> 41:49.180
and we hope we'll be reading your email

41:49.180 --> 41:50.600
on a future podcast.

41:50.600 --> 41:51.580
For now, back to the news.

41:51.580 --> 41:52.820
Loki, what do you got for us?

41:52.820 --> 41:56.220
Okay, the other things I was gonna be mentioning.

41:56.220 --> 41:57.440
There's a ton of stuff, of course,

41:57.440 --> 41:59.580
of the 360 launch going on.

41:59.580 --> 42:02.140
Some things I have that I found really funny.

42:02.140 --> 42:03.940
The first one being, of course,

42:04.840 --> 42:06.380
the golden tickets that are beginning.

42:06.380 --> 42:08.540
The golden ticket, the green golden tickets.

42:08.540 --> 42:11.700
The golden tickets are being given out at Walmart.

42:11.700 --> 42:14.140
I think those are just hilarious.

42:14.140 --> 42:16.220
Apparently, this is one of those things.

42:16.220 --> 42:18.900
They're going to be handling their first come, first serve

42:18.900 --> 42:19.800
type line thing.

42:19.800 --> 42:21.000
But you get a ticket.

42:21.000 --> 42:22.540
What's great about the thing, though,

42:22.540 --> 42:24.700
is the tickets are a little bit confusing.

42:24.700 --> 42:27.220
They are for the opposite of the colored box

42:27.220 --> 42:28.340
that they're supposed to be.

42:28.340 --> 42:29.740
So the green tickets are for the white box,

42:29.740 --> 42:30.980
and the white tickets are for the green.

42:30.980 --> 42:32.740
Oh, that won't cause any confusion at all.

42:32.740 --> 42:34.140
Actually, no, I take that back.

42:34.140 --> 42:34.640
I'm sorry.

42:34.640 --> 42:36.060
They're for the same boxes.

42:36.060 --> 42:38.300
However, their little form tells them

42:38.300 --> 42:44.860
which ones which, the white box is going to be the $2.99 and the green box being $3.99

42:44.860 --> 42:50.140
of course for all those who are pre-ordering those, those are completely opposite.

42:50.140 --> 42:54.020
So some people hopefully will be getting their systems for $100 less than they would have

42:54.020 --> 42:58.420
to be paying, which I think is quite funny.

42:58.420 --> 43:03.900
The other thing which is interesting, and this is completely on a different subject

43:03.900 --> 43:10.900
here. Actually, same subject, Xbox 360 Zero Hours, an event that's been going on in the

43:11.680 --> 43:12.780
Mojave Desert.

43:12.780 --> 43:19.140
Oh yeah, I wanted to see if we could go to that, but real work calls. We'll be able to

43:19.140 --> 43:19.820
do it.

43:19.820 --> 43:24.640
In order to get a ticket, they were doing this Blitz thing on Thursday actually, where

43:24.640 --> 43:29.900
you would have, I believe there's like 12 sites participating, all the major gaming

43:29.900 --> 43:33.580
and for basically they're giving out

43:33.580 --> 43:37.420
what do you mean all the major gaming sites we weren't in on it yeah we don't

43:37.420 --> 43:39.620
have an actual huge budget like they do okay

43:39.620 --> 43:44.460
they only have $25 now remember oh I'm sorry you have a $25 budget now

43:44.460 --> 43:48.260
no anyways so they were giving out I believe each site was giving out about

43:48.260 --> 43:49.740
360 tickets

43:49.740 --> 43:53.100
and then the rest of them were going to be randomly

43:53.100 --> 43:56.500
drawn actually on Monday

43:56.500 --> 44:01.800
so we'll find out who gets to go. 3,000 people including VIPs

44:01.800 --> 44:05.280
which will be contest winners from the Origin website

44:05.280 --> 44:10.320
and of course the Hex 168 site will be going there and you'll be

44:10.320 --> 44:14.120
greeted with 48 hours of pure gaming fun

44:14.120 --> 44:17.000
and celebrities. So it's like Burning Man with more games and less nudity?

44:17.000 --> 44:22.000
Yeah. Okay. And celebrities who really have no point being there

44:22.000 --> 44:24.440
Also, it's like the E3 booth.

44:24.440 --> 44:28.240
Yeah, and you also get to buy your Xbox 360

44:28.240 --> 44:31.680
a whole couple hours earlier than everybody else.

44:31.680 --> 44:35.720
Big misconception. They're not going to be handing you one out the door. You get to buy it.

44:35.720 --> 44:38.640
Will they be forcing you to take two games with it?

44:38.640 --> 44:42.120
Well, it is the Best Buy booth, so possibly.

44:42.120 --> 44:44.760
But yeah, that's going to be...

44:44.760 --> 44:46.520
This just leads into what I was talking about at the beginning of the cast, why I'm not doing this.

44:46.520 --> 44:48.320
Why I'm just not going to do it anymore.

44:48.320 --> 44:51.800
Well, here's why. It makes sense when you find out why

44:51.800 --> 44:55.640
they're trying to force games on you. In order to

44:55.640 --> 45:00.560
be able to have Xboxes at launch, you have to promise Microsoft you're going to do

45:00.560 --> 45:02.840
ten million dollars in business by the end of the year.

45:02.840 --> 45:05.720
Or else what?

45:05.720 --> 45:08.920
Or else what? They're going to slap you on the wrist?

45:08.920 --> 45:12.040
What, you're going to give a severe penalty to a big

45:12.040 --> 45:16.160
company like Best Buy? Crap, if I were a company like that, I'd pull your crap off

45:16.160 --> 45:18.840
my shelves. Good luck selling your damn system under these rules.

45:18.840 --> 45:26.840
Okay, I'm just some gaming fan with a little podcast, maybe I don't understand the bigger scope of things, so I'm sure I'll get emails on that, but whatever.

45:26.840 --> 45:30.840
You have to understand, they don't care. They don't care. You're nobody to them.

45:30.840 --> 45:31.840
Yeah, I know.

45:32.840 --> 45:36.840
It's my money, dammit! I should be somebody. The customer is always right.

45:36.840 --> 45:43.840
Anywho, in other news, I will file an error. It was bound to happen sooner or later.

45:43.840 --> 45:50.840
Nintendo is talking about possibly redesigning the DS, a la the, you know...

45:50.840 --> 45:52.840
Oh, so I can buy it again?

45:52.840 --> 45:53.840
Yeah!

45:53.840 --> 45:55.840
Oh, just like how there's like 50 different Game Boys out there I could buy?

45:55.840 --> 45:56.840
Exactly.

45:56.840 --> 45:57.840
Oh, what a shock!

45:57.840 --> 46:04.840
So, yeah, Reggie feels, I may drop the hint that the DS may be due for a redesign.

46:04.840 --> 46:08.840
Basically, yeah, it's not a surprise.

46:08.840 --> 46:12.920
They're gonna make it sleeker, I guess, and smaller and yadda yadda yadda yadda.

46:12.920 --> 46:15.920
Not a big surprise.

46:15.920 --> 46:20.520
Yeah. Alright, I got a story over here. NCSoft, you know NCSoft, they make

46:20.520 --> 46:21.400
Guild Wars.

46:21.400 --> 46:24.840
NCSoft is saying that they are going to be

46:24.840 --> 46:28.240
working on a console game. Chief Executive

46:28.240 --> 46:32.280
Tack Jin Kim mentioned that they were developing for the next generation

46:32.280 --> 46:33.360
consoles, but

46:33.360 --> 46:36.920
they're not saying exactly what they're doing, but if you think about it, well,

46:36.920 --> 46:38.640
they do MMOs,

46:38.640 --> 46:42.420
so that would seem like the most logical thing they're gonna put out

46:42.420 --> 46:45.060
but who knows anything is possible and I would think if they're gonna put out an

46:45.060 --> 46:45.820
MMO

46:45.820 --> 46:49.380
Xbox 360 is probably gonna be where they gravitate to but who knows

46:49.380 --> 46:52.860
anything's possible at this juncture but we do know NCSoft will be developing something

46:52.860 --> 46:56.380
I thought I'd want you to support Guild Wars to the console I bet a lot of

46:56.380 --> 47:00.060
people might get a kick out of that but what do I know? Again

47:00.060 --> 47:04.860
I'm just I'm just some guy. For those people who like to play games on their

47:04.860 --> 47:05.620
computer

47:05.620 --> 47:09.000
that they shouldn't be playing shame shame shame the emulators

47:09.000 --> 47:12.980
yeah anyways I'm so there's gonna be a there was a long-awaited mod

47:12.980 --> 47:17.020
that takes a legends although the ocarina of time and updates the graphics

47:17.020 --> 47:20.020
with high-res textures well it's finally out folks

47:20.020 --> 47:23.300
I'm course you will need me on the raw man

47:23.300 --> 47:28.060
emulator to play it anyways I'm you can definitely find this link at a four

47:28.060 --> 47:28.860
color

47:28.860 --> 47:32.380
rebellion dot com and that's I won the

47:32.380 --> 47:34.380
posts that they put on there from

47:34.740 --> 47:36.220
today actually

47:36.220 --> 47:37.740
November 13th

47:37.740 --> 47:44.100
So that's kind of interesting. I personally didn't get to play Ocarina of Time, even though I had the disc for the Gamecube, you know the

47:44.780 --> 47:48.940
Here's the weird thing. I I understand the Ocarina of Time is a

47:49.780 --> 47:52.100
treasured game that you know when you ask people

47:52.100 --> 47:56.180
What is your favorite game of all time Ocarina of Time like almost always comes near the top of the list

47:56.180 --> 48:02.620
I did not get as into this Zelda as I and I I'm in some category by myself sometimes

48:02.620 --> 48:04.160
I feel like I did not get into it

48:04.160 --> 48:08.860
and I don't know if it's the 3d thing that really just threw me that I never was able to get over but I

48:09.460 --> 48:12.280
Just keep going back to the Super Nintendo Zelda

48:12.280 --> 48:18.600
You know and how freaking wonderful that game was linked to the past and just to me nothing compares to that

48:18.600 --> 48:22.520
I don't even know if this new Zelda will compare to link link to the past to me, but

48:23.040 --> 48:25.040
at the same time the new

48:25.040 --> 48:28.880
Zelda looks very, very sexy, so maybe all will be forgiven, but we'll see.

48:28.880 --> 48:32.160
It'll be interesting. Anything else, Loki?

48:32.160 --> 48:36.200
Yeah, a couple more things. First, of course, the game I've been

48:36.200 --> 48:40.080
watching closely, Project Gotham Raised in 3, I actually watched, they had this

48:40.080 --> 48:42.320
twenty-five minute video discussing, like, all the

48:42.320 --> 48:45.880
details that went into the graphics, the physics, and everything, and the game looks

48:45.880 --> 48:46.500
amazing.

48:46.500 --> 48:50.320
But, apparently, it might not truly be high def.

48:50.320 --> 48:54.040
Big freaking whoop. But, apparently,

48:54.040 --> 49:02.040
There was a test version of the game that was shipped out to a reviewer and they actually did a screen cap of it straight from the machine.

49:03.040 --> 49:05.040
Anyways, dumping the graphic buffer or something like that.

49:05.040 --> 49:11.040
And it's 1024x600 instead of 1024x720. Big friggin' whoop.

49:11.040 --> 49:14.040
So it's not the exact same detail.

49:14.040 --> 49:20.040
The game looks amazing though, but of course there's controversy with the whole system launching soon.

49:20.040 --> 49:24.040
Is it not really high def? Ooh, are they lying? Yeah, whatever.

49:24.040 --> 49:28.040
Do the first generation games ever push the limits of the system? No.

49:28.040 --> 49:31.040
Not a shock.

49:31.040 --> 49:35.040
In other news, Marvel has signed, or actually I should say,

49:35.040 --> 49:39.040
Activision has signed a deal with Marvel extending their partnership

49:39.040 --> 49:42.040
for another 12 years or so.

49:42.040 --> 49:46.040
Basically allowing them to make games until 2017

49:46.040 --> 49:50.840
using the licenses of Marvel and it's going to be exclusive with them so you'll see

49:50.840 --> 49:55.000
wonderful games such as more Spider-Man and more X-Men games coming out. Not to

49:55.000 --> 49:59.240
say that they don't do bad games because the Ultimate Spider-Man... I heard very

49:59.240 --> 50:05.240
good things about that Spider-Man game, I didn't tell you myself. And X-Men Legends 2 was supposed to be pretty good too.

50:05.240 --> 50:11.240
See, X-Men Legends 1 disappointed the hell out of me. I was not a big fan of it, but I have heard that 2 is much better, so we'll see.

50:11.240 --> 50:15.200
is much better because you don't have to unlock multiplayer. That was retarded.

50:15.200 --> 50:17.920
I remember when we got that game we were just like, oh yeah, let's play multi...

50:17.920 --> 50:21.160
Oh, wait, we can't.

50:21.160 --> 50:26.280
Uh, speaking of Activision, I just wanted to drop this out there. Quake 4 is going

50:26.280 --> 50:28.980
to be a 360 launch title. It is coming out in time.

50:28.980 --> 50:31.880
You know, and with all the news about all these games getting pushed back, I suppose it would be

50:31.880 --> 50:34.880
refreshing for a change if you're an Xbox 360 fan

50:34.880 --> 50:38.120
to hear that Quake 4 will be dropping at launch. It was going to be dropping at launch.

50:38.120 --> 50:41.800
that was originally the case it was supposed to be on the 21st I heard now

50:41.800 --> 50:45.860
it's gonna be the 18th it is the 18th I just wanted to say that it has been

50:45.860 --> 50:51.020
confirmed by the studio it is happening eight player support over Xbox Live just

50:51.020 --> 50:57.180
an FYI that's really cool and it also has been reported that doa4 is actually

50:57.180 --> 51:01.060
pushed back to December now see now that was that was the game I was looking

51:01.060 --> 51:06.800
forward to more than any other but for the now before we all jump the gun here

51:06.800 --> 51:08.320
It was only pushed back a week.

51:08.320 --> 51:09.320
It's December 1st.

51:09.320 --> 51:10.320
Oh, okay.

51:10.320 --> 51:11.320
That's not a big deal.

51:11.320 --> 51:12.320
Big whoop.

51:12.320 --> 51:13.880
I mean, it's like, oh no, I've got to wait seven days.

51:13.880 --> 51:14.880
That's not such a big deal.

51:14.880 --> 51:18.200
But again, another reason why I do not need to be waiting out at line at six o'clock in

51:18.200 --> 51:21.240
the morning on next Tuesday.

51:21.240 --> 51:25.720
So I mean, and I've heard actually, I've heard other things seeing that it was, they're dropping

51:25.720 --> 51:29.640
it on the 18th also, which was very strange.

51:29.640 --> 51:34.040
I've been hearing mixed rumors on that, but I guess we'll find out in a few weeks, like

51:34.040 --> 51:35.040
next week.

51:35.040 --> 51:36.340
I mean, one's going to be coming out.

51:36.340 --> 51:39.940
So, big deal. There's tons of stuff, and I can wait seven days for a game. I mean, you're

51:39.940 --> 51:43.340
gonna be picking up launch games anyways. You don't need to have six games at launch.

51:43.340 --> 51:47.980
Well, I do, but, you know, that's just me, so...

51:47.980 --> 51:51.140
I'll still be playing Mario Kart DS for the next three weeks, hopefully.

51:51.140 --> 51:56.860
Oh, hell yes. I have to dominate the rankings for that.

51:56.860 --> 52:01.740
Good luck. Good luck. There are some sick, sick, sick Nintendo fanboys that will beat

52:01.740 --> 52:06.020
you up really bad online, and some of them are probably listening and can't wait to kick

52:06.020 --> 52:11.660
your ass that's perfectly fine it's on anything else I've only got one last

52:11.660 --> 52:16.100
story so Loki it's up to you you know I really don't have too much else other

52:16.100 --> 52:22.540
than yeah it's been all week long has been just stupid drama with you know the

52:22.540 --> 52:27.700
360 launch and that's basically been it it's been you know the whole rumors oh

52:27.700 --> 52:34.460
you know why why are they short shipping us why is this and that so all will be

52:34.460 --> 52:38.660
answered very soon it's still gonna be all drama this entire week is you know

52:38.660 --> 52:44.180
basically it but um yeah that's that's pretty much what I've got you know just

52:44.180 --> 52:49.180
that stuff quake 3 for the pocket PC you know but who owns a pocket PC you know

52:49.180 --> 52:53.700
compliance so who really wants to play quake 3 on a pocket PC anyway so well

52:53.700 --> 52:58.700
who wants to run Linux on a DS but they do it anyway so okay it does make

52:58.700 --> 53:04.380
homebrew and in the story of you know it's really been a slow news week

53:04.380 --> 53:08.940
People have been reporting on numerous websites when you pop in cameo in your Xbox

53:08.940 --> 53:13.540
It says put in Xbox 360 dumbass, you know, not really but you know

53:13.620 --> 53:15.820
It basically says this has been to be played on it

53:15.820 --> 53:21.020
So that's what people do with their games that they buy before the console is out. I wondered why people did that

53:21.140 --> 53:27.700
Okay, always answered. Thank you all other things, you know from you know instruction manuals being online for the 360

53:27.700 --> 53:34.060
I mean people are just dying to get anything, you know, I'm sick of the hype. I'm sorry

53:34.060 --> 53:37.500
I'm not trying to be anti Xbox here, but I am sick of the hype

53:37.780 --> 53:41.240
You know if you want the damn system or not by now have fun if you do

53:41.660 --> 53:45.780
Have fun waiting if you don't or whatever. I'm just yeah, I'm done. I

53:46.660 --> 53:51.140
Got one more story good one last story for tonight. This is really last story

53:51.140 --> 53:53.300
You're gonna surprise me with something else here. Loki possibly

53:54.180 --> 53:56.180
alright

53:56.180 --> 54:03.260
Keita Takahashi, who created Katamari Damacy and the sequel, gave an interview with the

54:03.260 --> 54:09.020
BBC this week and said that he probably doesn't really want to be doing gaming for the rest

54:09.020 --> 54:10.020
of his life.

54:10.020 --> 54:17.080
He's actually imagining developing a playground for children, so he's not really into doing

54:17.080 --> 54:23.100
video games for the rest of his life, but I'm just reminded of how Kojima always says

54:23.100 --> 54:25.900
he's not going to do another Metal Gear Solid and then, you know, the next year.

54:25.900 --> 54:26.900
Oh!

54:26.900 --> 54:27.900
Just kidding!

54:27.900 --> 54:28.900
Here's another one!

54:28.900 --> 54:29.900
I don't know.

54:29.900 --> 54:34.340
I think we should be forcing him to stay on video games because I'm kind of afraid to

54:34.340 --> 54:38.140
see what kind of playground equipment he's going to come up with.

54:38.140 --> 54:43.700
God damn, I mean, we don't actually need a physical Katamari out there.

54:43.700 --> 54:44.700
That's scary.

54:44.700 --> 54:45.700
Alright.

54:45.700 --> 54:46.700
That's it.

54:46.700 --> 54:47.700
That's all from me.

54:47.700 --> 54:48.700
Anything else?

54:48.700 --> 54:49.700
Any last minute stories, Logie?

54:49.700 --> 54:50.700
I got nothing.

54:50.700 --> 54:53.180
It's going to be more of the same next week, I'm sure.

54:53.180 --> 54:55.780
More games, more fun, more drama.

54:55.780 --> 54:57.660
Can't wait.

54:57.660 --> 54:58.660
We got a fun month ahead.

54:58.660 --> 55:01.220
The next six weeks are going to be a blast because we got the holiday season.

55:01.220 --> 55:03.900
Oh, it's going to be insane.

55:03.900 --> 55:04.900
You know what?

55:04.900 --> 55:11.420
I actually signed on to Final Fantasy XI to update it, and that's about it.

55:11.420 --> 55:13.920
I looked at the date that I last played it.

55:13.920 --> 55:14.920
Five months ago.

55:14.920 --> 55:15.920
I've been paying...

55:15.920 --> 55:17.940
And you've been paying, let's see, five times.

55:17.940 --> 55:18.940
How much do you pay him on?

55:18.940 --> 55:19.940
$12.95 or do you have another character?

55:19.940 --> 55:20.940
I have another character.

55:20.940 --> 55:25.980
Alright, so you paid $13.99 on the $14, and you paid $70 for nothing.

55:25.980 --> 55:27.980
I'm sure the fiancé is very pleased.

55:27.980 --> 55:28.980
Whatever.

55:28.980 --> 55:30.980
You know, I really don't care.

55:30.980 --> 55:32.060
I will play.

55:32.060 --> 55:34.540
I will play by the end of this month.

55:34.540 --> 55:35.540
Mark my words.

55:35.540 --> 55:40.060
I'll play World of Warcraft yesterday.

55:40.060 --> 55:41.060
I just don't have time.

55:41.060 --> 55:44.780
I gotta play, I have like certain games I have to play during the week, I have to play

55:44.780 --> 55:45.780
like everything comes out.

55:45.780 --> 55:46.960
No, you poor thing.

55:46.960 --> 55:47.960
Having to play video games.

55:47.960 --> 55:51.360
I have Ninja Turtles, and I haven't played that yet.

55:51.360 --> 55:54.200
Well, maybe we'll hear a review on that next week.

55:54.200 --> 55:56.440
For now, that's the show, we're pushing an hour, we're done.

55:56.440 --> 56:00.680
That's it for tonight's show. Next week, we'll have Minnie head on the show, we're gonna ask him questions, it'll be a good time.

56:00.680 --> 56:03.460
Final thoughts, Loki?

56:03.460 --> 56:07.700
I hope Mario Kart DS is gonna friggin' rock.

56:07.700 --> 56:11.620
You know, that's my exact same final thought is, Mario Kart DS, please,

56:11.620 --> 56:12.880
dear Nintendo, please

56:12.880 --> 56:15.520
do not screw up your online

56:15.520 --> 56:19.240
capabilities. But I have faith it's going to work. I think it's going to be an exciting

56:19.240 --> 56:20.440
era for the DS.

56:20.440 --> 56:23.720
And Animal Crossing DS in a few weeks after that.

56:23.720 --> 56:27.720
