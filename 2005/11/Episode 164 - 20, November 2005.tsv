277235	279715	Whoa, she's really, really broken up.
279755	280716	I don't know what's going on there.

333473	334074	Hello.
334094	334334	Well, hello.
334354	334594	All right.
337154	337815	All right, anyway.
337835	339615	Oh, also Bugs, Bugs is here.
340216	341017	Thank you for watching!
358089	358329	Weird.
358849	359450	And I don't snore.
359630	360250	Alright.
360991	361351	Alright.
362472	373138	Anyway, kids, what we're going to do, since it is a very special day here in the Bomani world, we're going to start off tonight by taking a real quick break to bring you a song.
374219	377360	And we'll come back and we're going to get into some music from Ultimix 3 as well.
377380	381863	But of course, because it is 20 November, you know we have to start off tonight with this song.
381903	384885	So here it is, 20 November, and we'll be back right after this.
449525	451609	Thank you for watching!
464232	466113	All right, we're back here on Orange Lounge Radio.
466153	467493	We're going to get into some music, though.
467653	470254	Now, see, that was just a special thing because it is 20 November.
470294	470734	We have to.
470954	473875	And we will give a happy belated 19 November later in the show.
473935	476856	But since it is kind of the Bomani holiday, I have no idea why.
477236	477916	Well, I do know why.
478376	481597	It's this big stupid thing that everybody, you know, recognizes in this scene.
481637	482117	So whatever.
482557	482958	There you go.
483978	486759	Okay, so we're going to get into some music, though, from Ultramix 3.
486979	487639	And I'll tell you what.
487699	490720	First thing I'm going to say about Ultramix 3, before we even really get into the show,
491441	494230	it's got a very interesting song list a very
496408	498289	Special song list, if you will.
498689	500190	It's definitely diverse.
500310	501010	We'll give it that.
501470	506252	So we're going to be playing... Special, like, special school bus, wearing the helmet special.
506392	507192	It's all kinds of special.
507472	512094	So we will be playing music from Ultimix 3 throughout tonight's show for you guys, and you be the judge.
512114	515336	We're going to play the good stuff and the bad stuff and the downright ugly stuff.
515356	516396	We're going to play it all tonight.
517076	520358	And the stuff that you guys like, we'll keep in rotation on our Bomani Music More.
520378	523219	But the stuff that's just like, what the fuck, we will...
524105	525665	Get Rid Of, and Never Play Again.
526366	533328	Alright, so, in this break we're going to start off, we're going to play, in this break, a track by Orifiz with Basile.
533368	536509	They were in the last Ultramix game, so this should be interesting.
536929	538949	We're going to play a song called Come With Me.
538989	540990	It's not the same one from the V-Rare, though.
541050	545211	It's by Yahil and Tammy, so it's the other Come With Me we're going to play in this break.
545631	548052	And then we're going to play Black Eyed Peas.
548092	550573	Black Eyed Peas have a brand new song in this Ultramix.
551073	551693	Shall we dance?
551733	552754	I can make of nothing I'd like better

882308	882568	Alla!
883089	885771	All right, also, we're joined by more special guests.
885811	886532	I'm so excited.
886552	888293	I love having special guests in the studio.
888354	888914	It's so exciting.
889475	893498	We have Mel B over here with no microphone.
893638	895980	Loki, let's get on that sharing the mic thing.
896501	897381	Mel, how you doing?
897762	898322	Doing great.
898382	901205	It's 20 November, and hey, what's a party without Melvis in the house?
901625	902306	Oh, that's right.
902346	904208	Now, how have things been with you?
905248	906790	Things have been pretty super.
906830	909152	I mean, just personally, things are pretty hectic.
909591	911052	DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
933530	935151	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
961793	963594	I've heard intimations about it.
963854	965154	I can't say much about it.
965174	965855	I don't know how much.
965935	968716	I might have said too much, but it's out there publicly.
968776	971197	Anybody can find it, so it's there.
971217	972117	It's going to launch soon.
972697	973898	Yeah, I've heard.
974498	979640	I've talked to people within the company about it, but I think that anyone else couldn't speculate on it.
979660	980541	It's got to be on the download.
980581	980801	I know.
980921	981761	I feel you.
981821	985223	I got noses out there in every direction finding this stuff out.
985463	985843	It's all good.
986043	991225	Yeah, the cool thing, actually, just back on T-shirt real quick, this is actually the first prize I ever won in a DDR tournament.
992148	994169	This is the end of Freestyle back in SoCal.
994189	996390	I think it was 2000, Santa Monica Pier Tourney.
996770	998931	And there were only like three t-shirts given out.
998951	1002253	And I think overall, of people I know in the community, there are only like five.
1003193	1003674	Wow.
1004274	1006755	Yeah, I'm one of the special Fab Five.
1007195	1012098	Now, I have to ask you really quickly before we get into the other stuff in the show.
1012538	1014639	Did you listen to this week's podcast that we do?
1014959	1016700	Yes, as a matter of fact, I did.
1016820	1017881	What did you think about...
1018581	1019001	www.darksakura.com
1037113	1040295	Badum, you got your own internet movie database page.
1040555	1041676	I had no idea.
1041856	1049140	I mean, people talk about being, you know, some sort of internet celebrity or whatever, but being on IMDb, that's a whole different sort of freaky.
1050120	1052262	And they still can't even spell my last name right.
1052342	1053923	Is your last name spelled wrong on there?
1054183	1056144	Yes, I do not have an H in my last name.
1056224	1058985	I don't know why people assume there is, but eh.
1059746	1059866	Oh.
1060182	1060743	Shark's Girl Melody
1078447	1081628	Now, tell us about this fundraiser you're a part of.
1081968	1087571	I know this is a big part of your life lately, and I'm just curious.
1089371	1105898	Yeah, I decided in May, actually, that I was going to look into joining the team in training through the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society to walk a marathon, and at that point in time, I was literally waiting for E3, the day of the meeting, and things weren't working out time-wise, so I thought, okay, I'll join the fall season.
1106431	1113141	So I went back in July and started training on July 31st, and I've been training for a marathon.
1113161	1117948	I'm going to be walking 26.2 miles, hopefully, on December 11th in Honolulu.
1118830	1125376	and I'm up to, I've raised $3,675 so far for leukemia and lymphoma research.
1125636	1126857	Wow, that's amazing.
1126937	1131061	Now, if folks want to donate more, because you can go above and beyond, right?
1131081	1132602	Do we have a link we can give or something?
1132662	1137066	I'm actually over my total, but I'm taking everything anyone's willing to give me, even if it's just a dollar or two.
1137547	1143071	The best thing to do is go to livejournal.com slash user slash melathon, M-E-L-A-T-O-N.
1143812	1144352	How do you spell it?
1144372	1145493	It's like marathon only with Mel.
1145653	1146353	Melathon.
1146413	1147734	I can't even think of how to spell it myself.
1147754	1148674	That's kind of sad.
1148854	1149194	How about this?
1149314	1150635	M-E-L-A-T-H-O-N.
1150795	1151135	Thank you.
1151215	1151575	You're welcome.
1151935	1155056	So, yeah, that's pretty much been my life lately.
1155076	1158478	I was supposed to walk 22 miles yesterday.
1158598	1163059	I did 12 because on Tuesday I fell and ran my knee into a curb.
1163079	1166641	And it's very lovely and pretty multicolors.
1167141	1167441	Ouch.
1168320	1172764	Yeah, it's kind of put a damper in a thing since I'm three weeks out from the marathon.
1172924	1178189	Yeah, that's... I've got a backup plan in place and my coach is not that worried.
1178269	1180791	Now, did you use DDR for any of your stamina training?
1181672	1185215	Just the background that I already had because he actually yelled at me not to do anything else.
1185255	1186216	Really?
1186296	1190539	For fear of hurting myself, which instead I go and I walk and run into a curb.
1190719	1191480	You know I had to ask.
1192301	1193522	Yeah, you all had to ask.
1193682	1195724	Actually, I haven't turned on my DDR machine and...
1196502	1203184	Theoretically, this show is about DDR and music games and stuff, so I have to bring it up once in a while to interject the idea.
1203544	1206885	The illusion that we actually play DDR once in a while still.
1206905	1208545	There you go.
1209186	1210306	So that's been most of my life.
1210446	1217568	Every Saturday, the most I've walked at one time is 15 miles straight, and that took about five hours, I think.
1217768	1217988	Wow.
1218607	1221608	I need time to go shop and then say hey I want that and go back.
1243683	1256867	Alright, um, what we're gonna do now, um, we're gonna try, now we tried to get DarkSakura on the show in the beginning, but unfortunately our Skype was going a little bit crazy, so I'm going to try and, uh, get DarkSakura back on the line here.
1257788	1259468	So, let's see if we have any luck here.
1259488	1260488	I gotta bring up Skype.
1266290	1266750	That's weird.
1266970	1268831	It almost sounds like it's calling her actual phone phone.
1270192	1270532	Let's see.
1270612	1271392	Do-do-do-do-do-do.
1272799	1273840	One ringy dingy dingy.
1278262	1279263	Hello?
1279763	1280303	Hello?
1283165	1283645	Hello?
1284986	1285586	That was weird.
1285646	1287687	It sounded all phantom-y when she came on.
1287947	1288508	Hello?
1288588	1289508	Like all broken up.
1289548	1289988	That's weird.
1290469	1292230	Do we have any other stuff going?
1292250	1295892	Let me lower our bandwidth here.
1295932	1296912	Live radio, everybody.
1296932	1298253	This stuff happens once in a while.
1298273	1300094	I'm just trying to kill any excess bandwidth we have.
1301334	1302115	Can you hear us, Jamie?
1302135	1302235	Jamie?
1304693	1305694	Yeah, can you hear me?
1306354	1311237	There, okay, we've got her a little bit there, we just got a really bad delay there, but that's alright, we can deal with that.
1312378	1313858	DarkSakura, what's going on?
1313918	1314939	How are you doing?
1314979	1325285	You're kind of sick, I know, but... I thought it was... Hello?
1325906	1327727	Hi, what's going on, DarkSakura?
1327947	1328827	I just closed IRC.
1328867	1329308	Oh, okay.
1329768	1329988	Okay.
1331856	1338938	They thought I had pneumonia, and it turns out to be a really bad case of bronchitis.
1339478	1340919	So I'm really sick.
1340939	1344260	I spent most of the week sick, and it started getting better.
1344280	1346140	I went to the doctor on Monday.
1362211	1384009	and I started getting better around Wednesday, Thursday and then I had a bad relapse on Friday and my boss basically sent me to the doctor right away and he x-rayed and I have some fluid in my lungs but not enough to qualify as full-blown pneumonia so they're treating me for severe bronchitis.
1385330	1389453	Still, either way, bronchitis or pneumonia, no fun at all, I imagine, so...
1390632	1391192	It's the Muppet Show!
1418407	1421589	See, this is Jamie's week in a nutshell, unfortunately, is the Muppet Show here.
1422910	1425171	Yeah, and not doing my homework until the weekend.
1426152	1428533	Don't you get a bye from your homework, though, when you're sick?
1429174	1431235	No, unfortunately.
1432035	1438299	Some of my classes are online, so I don't necessarily... Your professors are evil for not letting you have a bye on your homework.
1439040	1443042	One of my teachers is giving us a week off for Thanksgiving in one of my online classes.
1443923	1445844	Now, what are your plans for Thanksgiving?
1445904	1447365	Is this going to get in the way of Thanksgiving?
1448135	1455482	I have no idea, but I'm tired of being stuck in the house, because I had to miss going to see Chemical Angel on Saturday.
1456864	1466534	I missed the show tonight, and I missed seeing my friend, one of my old co-workers who moved to Delaware was in town today, and I missed my chance to see her.
1467675	1469156	So we did talk on the phone for a little bit.
1469436	1470898	Well, that's something, okay.
1472538	1476020	But, it's just been bleh.
1476120	1477701	I slept 17 hours yesterday.
1477721	1478862	I had a cold.
1478882	1480523	This is what my cold turned into.
1480583	1481023	That's sucky.
1481043	1482324	When do the doctors think you'll be better?
1501339	1507483	I don't know, but he put me on, I was on Keflex, which is kind of a mild antibiotic.
1508163	1513406	That was for the sinus infection, and then once he found out just how bad it was, he put me on doxycycline.
1514787	1517608	Which is, from what I understand, supposed to be pretty hardcore stuff.
1518129	1518429	Wow.
1519530	1524192	Yeah, so he gave me a seven day supply, but I'm going to see how I feel.
1524352	1526313	It's helping some, I'm getting a little better.
1526594	1527134	That's good.
1527154	1528975	I have to go back to work tomorrow.
1529481	1529941	Oh, gosh.
1530001	1531922	I hope you get a lot better by Thursday.
1531942	1533142	At least this is short work week.
1533262	1535242	I mean, there's something to look forward to there, a little bit.
1536662	1537043	I guess.
1538123	1538863	What else was I going to ask?
1538943	1543764	Oh, before, you know, we're going to go around the room and see how everybody else's weekend day was, but I wanted to ask, what were your thoughts?
1543784	1547264	I know you haven't had a chance to play games, so you haven't had a chance to check out Ultramix 3 yet.
1547665	1549205	What do you think of the music so far, though?
1551245	1552445	I wouldn't be the one to ask.
1552466	1553506	I haven't been paying attention.
1553566	1554786	I've been either...
1555322	1556583	Passed out or doing homework.
1556783	1557304	That's all right.
1557404	1558044	It's understandable.
1558585	1561347	Okay, well, Jamie, what we're going to do, we're going to go back around the room.
1561367	1563889	We'll bring you back later in the show, though, for some of our other stuff, okay?
1563909	1564909	Okay.
1565069	1565750	All right, take care.
1565790	1566230	Rest up.
1567631	1567932	All right.
1567992	1571174	All right, any final words for the listeners for right now?
1572135	1572835	Send me money.
1573236	1574837	Okay, we will do.
1574857	1576158	Okay.
1576238	1577059	All right, bye.
1577239	1577759	Bye.
1577959	1578540	Bye now.
1579485	1581266	Alright, we'll bring her back on the show a little later.
1581346	1589292	She feels bad because she wasn't here last week and she's been out, but obviously she's got to rest up, so we hope she gets better very soon.
1589813	1593115	Well, let's go around the room and see how other folks are having their day and their week.
1593296	1597819	We'll start with Angel, because she's over there just lounging around there with the microphone, ready to go.
1599360	1599640	What's up?
1600281	1600741	How was your week?
1600761	1602703	How was your day?
1602763	1602943	Good.
1604104	1607606	I did something I said I wasn't going to do, and you're going to laugh now.
1607927	1608307	What's that?
1608743	1610104	I rolled Alliance.
1611885	1612186	Wait.
1612666	1614788	Oh, you joined an alliance on World of Warcraft.
1614888	1616029	I rolled Alliance.
1616069	1618631	Yeah, I rolled an Alliance character on a different server.
1618991	1619391	Oh, okay.
1619431	1619872	What server?
1620712	1621293	Malfurion.
1621753	1622033	Okay.
1623154	1627557	Um, it's... Okay.
1628918	1629599	Okay.
1629759	1630720	He's never gonna laugh.
1631781	1632161	Oh, yeah.
1632661	1633862	Well, anyway...
1637332	1638513	Careful, that microphone's the weird one.
1638533	1640294	You gotta make sure you're... Yeah, it's weird.
1640694	1641574	It doesn't like me.
1641594	1642075	There you go.
1642155	1642695	There you go.
1643115	1643455	Yay.
1643676	1644536	Yay for wiring.
1644776	1650079	Okay, so... Yeah, so I said I wasn't gonna do it, and then I did.
1650379	1657743	So, I don't know, everything's weird now, because I'm so used to, like, playing Horde and stuff, so... So now you're having to play as the bad guy.
1658924	1663166	Well, actually, yeah.
1663186	1663747	In a way.
1663767	1665067	Or what else have you been playing this week?
1665107	1666168	Not just World of Warcraft, but...
1667757	1672599	Oh, uh, um, yeah, Guitar Hero, because I just got that tool.
1672859	1673099	Yeah?
1673159	1674540	How's Guitar Hero working out for you?
1675260	1681943	Uh, sometimes the notes go too fast, but if I concentrate on what's going where, everything's cool.
1681983	1683884	So, what else did we get this week?
1684004	1685964	What do you think about Guitar Hero compared to Guitar Freaks?
1687985	1694968	Um, I haven't, I didn't get to play Guitar Freaks that much, because, you know, when I first started coming up here and stuff with you guys...
1695774	1697055	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1715875	1719899	All is good, but I still like my World of Warcraft Have you been on Mario Kart Frenzy this week?
1720980	1731849	Yes, I got to play with Slinky and BigRandPimp and DJ Ranma S and just, you know, all of my buddies, it's fun The online thing is crazy, isn't it?
1732009	1734892	Yes it is, and there's no lag, at least I don't think
1735720	1736360	Is there lag?
1736540	1737041	No, not really.
1737061	1737641	I don't notice it.
1738361	1738661	Yeah.
1738681	1739062	It's great.
1739202	1745044	So, I've been doing a lot of gaming this week when I should be concentrating on school, which I'm doing too.
1745885	1747886	But gaming's much more fun.
1748186	1748946	Especially this week.
1748966	1751067	This is such a big week with all the releases that came out last week.
1751087	1751848	All the games.
1752468	1754889	Going into next week and the 360 and all that crap.
1755509	1756890	I don't even have a PSP yet.
1757550	1757871	Oh well.
1757951	1758231	Soon.
1758551	1758971	Anything else?
1759411	1759671	No.
1759972	1760212	Alright.
1760272	1761012	I don't think so.
1762233	1763253	I feel like a bat.
1765709	1765969	Angel, wake up!
1766069	1766730	Angel, wake up!
1786713	1789035	I actually have to learn some basic braille.
1789055	1792078	Or you have to learn to write really big.
1792118	1795422	Actually, instead of that, what we do is I write audio scripts for stuff.
1795442	1797243	Say for a math problem, there's a
1810799	1814845	Drawing of a triangle, which is like, you know, four or five, you know, whatever the Pythagorean triple is.
1815346	1817790	But the thing is, of course, obviously a blind person can't see that.
1818311	1821656	And, you know, you can't necessarily make like a raised diagram for them to feel around.
1821716	1823379	So you actually have to write the description like,
1823800	1825681	There is a triangle, ABC.
1826161	1831564	You know, B is a right angle, and, you know, side AB equals 4, and BC equals 5, you know, by this logic.
1831584	1832264	That's hard!
1832785	1834386	It's so hard to do, and you can't see.
1834946	1842190	It's really like a, kind of a crash course in articulation, and, like, basically, you're kind of thinking, well, if someone was from another planet, how would you describe all this stuff to them?
1842210	1842630	So it's...
1843160	1845801	How would you describe DDR to somebody who is visually impaired?
1850704	1853966	There is loud Japanese Eurobeat music playing.
1854826	1858748	There are arrows slowly crawling up the screen.
1858988	1862070	But if you're visually impaired, how do you know what an arrow is?
1863852	1866434	Easy, all the time.
1867094	1873357	There is somebody dancing on a pad with arrows and the pad lights up when they step on it.
1873938	1877960	This person looks really gay playing this game.
1879961	1880842	Shut up, Rob.
1880862	1893189	This person is holding on to a bar that is pink in color with a black top that has since been ripped off by little six-year-old shits at Golf Land.
1897475	1898876	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1919665	1936595	Oh, actually, the Create a Wrestler mode has been around since, like, I think, a couple versions ago, but this time they've gotten even more detailed with things, like, you know, this time you can customize your entrance, like, you know, different types of, you can have, like, fireworks go off, you know, at certain points, or you can, like,
1936915	1941397	Have the camera pan around to someone else or, you know, all sorts of... That's great.
1941417	1944599	You can do the techno, you know, lighting, all sorts of things.
1944619	1950062	The game makes you spend, like, an hour coming up with a perfect introduction and, like, no time on the actual game.
1950122	1951082	I'll put it like this.
1951262	1954024	When I was making my first character, it took me about three and a half hours.
1954044	1954684	Oh, my God.
1955104	1963929	You know, that's... But that's because not only are you making the character, but because it's a new game, you want to see what new types of hairstyles or, like, clothes you could put on people, so...
1964389	1967490	It's just exploration, really, but it's still pretty damn fun.
1967850	1971552	That's kind of like Soul Calibur III has a make-a-fighter mode.
1971592	1973172	It's pretty intensive, too.
1973592	1978834	But you don't get to do your intro, which is too bad, because Soul Calibur III practically has wrestling intros.
1978854	1984116	It's like, the soul will burn as two entrants come for the next battle.
1984996	1988818	I shall destroy you with every inch of my being!
1989670	1991571	Do we have to fight now?
1992072	1994253	Let there be a great battle!
1995234	1999597	Swear to God, Soul Calibur goes on and on with the setups of these fights.
2000958	2007043	Rob, you would do a good intro for the next World of Warcraft thing?
2007283	2009264	I should be Soul Calibur 4, it's all about me.
2009865	2014028	I am the Pencils Pope, you killed my father, prefer to die!
2016129	2016630	Alright...
2017910	2019672	Anyway, sorry, I keep cutting you off, buddy
2041823	2043044	But it's still pretty cool.
2043064	2047546	I think the most fun though is just creating the characters and like, you know, making mockeries of all your friends.
2048026	2049807	You know, that's the fun of it.
2049847	2052489	Making characters that look like your friends and then kicking the shit out of them.
2052789	2054090	That's what we do essentially.
2054270	2056311	Everybody in like RTF and Step Squad.
2056791	2058612	Yeah, we just have like these big get-togethers.
2059252	2062494	I make my characters in Soul Calibur 3 look really, really faggy.
2062574	2063274	Like the best I can.
2063535	2067717	Like I gave one a pope hat and a clown necklace and no pants.
2069645	2073507	And he's wearing like a little jockstrap or something where I swear you can like see his ass.
2074888	2075588	And it's purple.
2076248	2077149	For no real reason.
2077169	2079250	I gotta see this character.
2079270	2079690	It's great.
2079790	2081931	I love creating a character in Soul Calibur 3.
2081971	2083092	Yeah, let's see.
2083112	2083752	What else?
2083812	2087434	Guitar Hero, obviously, has been also getting a lot of playtime.
2087634	2088594	That's pretty fun.
2088814	2090595	And, uh, let's see.
2090735	2093657	And, uh, yeah, those are pretty much the two main games I've been playing this week.
2094397	2096678	And, yeah, everything's been pretty good all together.
2096718	2098179	And today, hey, I'm here, you know.
2099003	2099503	20 November.
2100884	2101184	All right.
2102365	2103445	Shark's Girl, how was your week?
2103465	2103885	How was your day?
2104746	2110868	My week has been the same as every week for the last, I don't know how many, I walked a lot.
2111709	2114170	God, I've probably done over 250 miles at this point.
2114270	2115090	Keep you healthy, though.
2115110	2115470	Oh, yeah.
2115491	2116091	I've lost a lot of weight.
2116111	2117111	I should be training for a marathon.
2117131	2117591	Oh, it's great.
2117992	2119512	But, yeah, I worked.
2120073	2120633	I walked.
2120693	2123854	I actually went to a store called Sur La Table.
2123894	2127696	I don't know if anyone else, I don't know if it's a Bay Area thing or if it's nationwide or what.
2128103	2132367	But it's one of those places where it's like a cooking utensil store, but they also have like a kitchen and stuff.
2133288	2136751	And my work hired it out and brought a bunch of people we work with in.
2136771	2140135	There were like 40 people there, and we all drank wine and made food.
2140655	2141716	And it was really entertaining.
2142517	2146341	And I now have a really good recipe for petite beef wellingtons if anyone wants it.
2146941	2148143	But yes, I did that.
2148203	2148623	I walked.
2149371	2150411	and aforementioned walking.
2151672	2155773	I'm very, very lucky because the one game I have been playing a lot of is Guitar Hero.
2156133	2158393	And I was carrying my guitar when I fell.
2159234	2163775	And I'm just lucky the back of it hit the curb and took chunks out of it versus the front or the buttons.
2164055	2164595	Oh, yeah.
2164635	2168836	Yeah, so... Wait, how did you fall with a Guitar Hero controller?
2168936	2170377	I was... You know I have to ask.
2170497	2172557	I was holding a bunch of stuff.
2172597	2174318	I was going to my car from Mel's.
2174378	2175018	It was like 11.30 at night.
2176722	2206185	and I was wearing my heels from work which I don't wear like skinny ones but still they're heels so I had my Guitar Hero controller slung around my no I was holding the neck of it in my left hand I had my purse up there and I was holding something else in my right hand I stepped up on a curb and I think I stepped onto a rock and it turned out from underneath me and I went straight down next thing I know I'm like why am I on the ground and then Mel's looking at me like why are you on the ground and then it hits me that the best thing to do in this situation would be curse loudly so I did and
2206744	2213588	Probably scared the shit out of the neighbors, and yeah, so, yeah, the Guitar Hero controller hit the ground right next to me.
2214429	2217671	So, I have a few little gouges out of the back of it, but it still plays.
2217791	2219772	But as long as it works, that's the important part.
2219792	2220032	Oh, yeah.
2220312	2221513	Yeah, it still works, trust me.
2222654	2223995	Anything else you want to share about your week and your day?
2226356	2227657	Have you been doing the Mario Kart thing?
2227997	2229678	No.
2229738	2232340	Okay, this is when you kick me out of the house.
2232540	2233801	No, I'm not going to kick you out of the house.
2233861	2235582	I've never played Mario Kart ever.
2238078	2240640	The look of stunned silence is amazing.
2240820	2242522	I'm sorry, I have to point and laugh.
2244804	2246325	How did that happen?
2246365	2247486	You just not interested?
2248007	2254052	I just never really got into it, and none of my friends really had it, so I didn't have exposure to it that way.
2254752	2256514	And now you're handing me a DS with Mario Kart?
2256534	2258455	I was just telling Mel that I need to play it.
2258475	2258856	Play me!
2258956	2259937	Play me, Mel!
2259997	2261998	His DS is telling me to play it.
2262199	2262559	Play!
2263360	2263800	There you go.
2264281	2267782	Actually, mine is also sitting over there, so you can play.
2268523	2281429	So, yeah, pretty much my week has been walking, and everything is going to be walking up until December 11th, upon which at night it's party and collapse, and then it's hang out in Hawaii time, and then life returns to normal.
2282390	2282790	All right.
2282830	2282910	Yeah.
2283342	2283682	That was it.
2284062	2284902	Sounds good.
2284922	2291564	Now, what's this part about how I'm going to be joining you in Hawaii, how you actually got me a ticket and was going to surprise me on the show with it tonight?
2291884	2292565	What was this about?
2292785	2296126	Well, darn, you ruined the surprise, damn it.
2297286	2301787	Maybe next year, maybe next year I'll train, but it's a lot of time.
2301867	2308629	It is a lot of time, but honestly, it's one of the best experiences I've ever had in my life, and I'm so close with all these people that I've been training with.
2308749	2312110	It's a big commitment, but it's totally worth it.
2312622	2315485	And if anyone wants to talk to me about it, go ahead and email me, find me.
2315685	2317327	I'll put a post on Orange Lounge or something.
2317587	2318027	Sounds good.
2318207	2318408	Cool.
2318548	2318828	All right.
2319248	2320129	Loki, how was your week?
2320149	2320510	How was your day?
2322351	2323673	My week was good until today.
2324754	2328277	Or actually, I should say, yeah, yeah, until about today.
2331300	2337306	Last week, because I hadn't gotten an oil change in forever, I decided to go and get an oil change for my car.
2338499	2342505	And like luck as it would be, they fucked up my car again.
2342525	2345691	If this isn't the same place that wrecked your old car, thank god.
2345731	2348976	Different place, different car, still fucking stuff up.
2349363	2354525	So now my car leaks coolant and overheats thanks to them.
2354905	2356625	And so now I got to get that fixed.
2357065	2358126	I got to take work off.
2358566	2359646	It's just a pain in the ass.
2359986	2360526	It really is.
2362367	2368529	However, aside from that, because my whole week's been kind of doing the roller coaster ride of highs and lows.
2368989	2377631	Last night we went to the strip club, and that was kind of fun, because we had titties in our face all night, and lap dances, and so Nelly had a pretty good time.
2378931	2384072	And then, I don't know, that was pretty much it, yeah, that was the highlights of the week.
2384432	2398115	Oh, I have Xbox 360 games and no Xbox system, and GameStop was wonderful and decided to go ahead and sell my copy of Project Gotham Racing, even though I had a pre-order for it, and came there, showed them my receipt, and they're like, uh, oops.
2402921	2407967	And then I got a recorded message saying, You're not going to get your system until after Christmas!
2408328	2411712	Which, you know, that's based on their current allocations of what they're going to get.
2412874	2415877	But it's just going to be a big giant circus this week.
2416458	2416598	So...
2417392	2418993	I'm looking forward to completely ignoring
2437586	2446993	I'm freaking addicted already You said you've been playing all week and I have not run into you once I haven't touched World of Warcraft in five days I know
2467867	2473712	I actually got to play the Mario Kart arcade version yesterday.
2487535	2488675	at Milpitas Golf Land.
2488695	2489975	It's actually pretty fun.
2489996	2494216	They got not only Nintendo, but Namco also was in on it.
2494616	2496477	So now you can write as Pac-Man, Ms.
2496517	2497497	Pac-Man, or Blinky.
2497957	2498577	I heard about that.
2498597	2499417	That's so badass.
2499697	2501038	So they have that at Milpitas Golf Land?
2501118	2501458	Yes, they do.
2501478	2504098	The only thing that sucks is they don't have card readers.
2504898	2513000	And it's like, oh, actually, in a way, it's bad, but it's good, too, because if there was a card reader, I probably would have dropped like 20 bucks yesterday.
2513587	2520432	Okay, so I'm going to a birthday party in Hayward, like, in two weeks, so now I'm gonna have to swing by Milpitas, even though that's, like, an hour drive, I don't care.
2520512	2521713	About two weeks?
2521733	2523875	Like, the first of December or something, it's like a Friday.
2524075	2524875	Yeah, I'll definitely let you know.
2525115	2525456	Absolutely.
2526617	2526897	Alright.
2526917	2527097	Yeah.
2527297	2533422	The only, like, drawback to this is you can't totally, I mean, the power sliding isn't, like, totally there, but you can do, like, jump drifts.
2533642	2533842	Hmm.
2534181	2536682	So, you know, it's a little different, but they have, like, all the courses there.
2536702	2539343	You can do the jump drifts in this, too, kind of use that same thing, yeah.
2539363	2542744	Yeah, where you, like, dig into the gas and you hit the brake and then, yeah, you can do that.
2542764	2543265	Sort of, sort of.
2543285	2545826	And this one you wiggle back and forth after you do a jump, yeah.
2546066	2546366	Oh, wow.
2546406	2547066	It's kind of interesting.
2547586	2548127	So, anyway.
2548707	2550247	All right, we're going to go to another break.
2550608	2552468	I want to talk a lot about Ultramix 3 tonight.
2552548	2554829	I know you guys have your opinions you want to state, too.
2555049	2556310	We're going to get to all of that.
2556750	2559533	Right after this next break, but we need to take a break because I need something to drink.
2559993	2560614	Something stiff.
2561094	2563957	In this break, we're going to hear some more Ultramix 3 music.
2564057	2566559	In this break, we're going to hear I Am Gothic, because I love this song.
2567160	2567900	Where's Your Head At?
2567960	2568941	by Basement Jacks.
2569602	2571904	Nari Narin by J. Dobby.
2571964	2573826	It's a little bit of a Bollywood type.
2573866	2574406	It's kind of cool.
2574667	2577930	And then Stakeout, the Ultramix by Freeze Pop.
2577950	2579211	So we're going to hear all that this break.
2579231	2581413	We'll be back with more Orange Lawn Radio after this.
2619850	2620711	Thanks for watching!
2649311	2650654	Thanks for watching!
2695298	2696481	Thank you for watching!
2902302	2903063	Thank you for watching!
2934111	2934971	Thanks for watching!
2995066	2998933	Orange Lounge Radio, Mamani Music, and more.
3001254	3002334	We're back here on Orange Launch Radio.
3002354	3004535	In that break, you heard I Am Gothic by Spray.
3004575	3005736	Where's your head at, Basement Jacks?
3005756	3007396	Which, by the way, has a very freaky video.
3007456	3009097	It's in that mix.
3009697	3013859	Nari Nari by J. Dobby and Stakeout, the Ultra Mix by Freeze Pop.
3014559	3018401	I don't want to say too much, but please keep your fingers crossed for me.
3019201	3021982	I got a contact over at Freeze Pop, and I'm trying to get them on the show.
3022302	3026884	So, please pray to whatever deity that we can get them on the show, because I love Freeze Pop.
3026904	3028465	I would love to have them on the program.
3028505	3031166	And if anybody out there from the Freeze Pop camp is listening, please come
3033307	3036929	We made our freaks look so uber chic.
3038030	3038871	We shop at Target.
3040171	3041172	Trust me, no, seriously.
3041372	3043473	I shop so much at Target.
3043513	3044274	It's disgusting.
3044314	3045995	Probably this whole house is furnished with Target.
3046555	3050598	The thing with Target that reminds me is the sad news about Vanilla Coke's passing.
3050718	3057622	I can remember going to a Target with you and finding every damn bottle of Vanilla Coke they had and buying it when it first came out.
3058703	3061925	I have that picture in my cubicle at work.
3062605	3063646	It makes me sad.
3063666	3066807	I'll have to put that next to the picture of me as a toddler with Crystal Pepsi.
3067308	3067668	I'm kidding.
3068248	3068428	Alright.
3068448	3068508	Rob!
3073402	3073682	What?
3073702	3075343	I drank that stuff, too.
3075784	3076144	No, I know.
3076184	3076404	I did.
3076464	3077244	I wasn't a toddler.
3077645	3079926	That shit was out when we were in, what, junior high or so?
3079946	3080767	We're about the same age.
3080807	3081887	I used to drink it all the time.
3083008	3085409	Don't forget, I'm not that much younger than you are.
3086710	3087010	Sir.
3088351	3089672	I'm getting yelled at by the chat room.
3089812	3092134	Chat room, by the way, www.orangesoundtrader.com.
3092154	3092714	Click on chat.
3093234	3095376	MPQ says, Stop saying Tar-jay.
3095736	3099498	Hey, it's better than the new one I've started hearing recently because all my friends shop there.
3099518	3099798	Tar-gay.
3099818	3100339	Tar-gay.
3103148	3104669	So if you want, buddy.
3105309	3105809	No, all right.
3105869	3106830	We all know it's Target.
3107270	3107891	We all know it's Target.
3107991	3109071	But I like that Target.
3109872	3110572	It makes it sound chic.
3110692	3113294	It makes it sound like Saks Fifth Target.
3113694	3114134	It's great.
3114834	3116215	We have to feel upper class, okay?
3116315	3116956	Yeah, I know.
3117356	3118476	At least it's not Kmartay.
3120748	3126412	Kmart is like, you heard that Martha Stewart was thinking about buying Kmart and they were going to call it K-Martha.
3127833	3128894	That's not a fucking joke.
3128914	3129834	That's not a fucking joke.
3131656	3134778	But they're having like this huge sale and anyway, it's just ghetto.
3134898	3135758	Kmart's ghetto.
3135778	3137079	Why would Martha Stewart want to buy Kmart?
3137099	3137900	Kmart is ghetto.
3138399	3140040	and I'll see you next time.
3155851	3157592	DGR Ultramix 3
3176996	3177437	No, I'm kidding.
3177457	3180161	There's actually a lot to like about Ultima 3.
3180201	3181062	I like Xbox Live.
3181403	3182485	Xbox Live is a lot cleaner.
3182845	3183987	It's a lot better, I think.
3184468	3187272	I like the fact that you can send messages to people within Xbox Live.
3187592	3190657	I like how you don't have to quit out of the game and come back in to...
3192219	3195661	Download new stuff that the new content stuff is integrated into the game.
3195881	3203105	I think they did a very good job with that and sending the messages back to each other and seeing who all is online playing the game, not necessarily in your room.
3203425	3204306	I think that's all great.
3204386	3206667	So the Xbox Live portion looks great.
3206787	3207027	Love it.
3208008	3208628	Song list.
3209560	3210480	It's half and half for me.
3210881	3212862	There's some awesome stuff in the song list.
3212942	3216003	I love the spray song.
3216063	3217564	I love the real life song.
3217604	3219085	I love the gothy and trancy stuff.
3219125	3219845	I always do, though.
3220325	3224547	And then I love some of the stuff that they brought over from other Bomani stuff.
3224727	3226408	Like Right on Time from Guitar Freaks is great.
3226448	3228349	Himawari from Guitar Freaks is well.
3230190	3233832	Parade of the Wooden Soldiers, WTF, but that's kind of neat.
3234572	3236713	Akumajo Dracula Medley, of course, was an awesome pick.
3236993	3237834	They picked some good stuff.
3238274	3267849	but then the song list kind of goes weird for me because they tried with the song list in Ultramix 3 to be much more eclectic and that is very obvious like they have more rap type stuff with the Alphabet Aerobics and Run DMC and they have some rock type stuff with Good Charlotte and The Clash and NoFX and then they have some old stuff like they have Ray Charles with What'd You Say let me play a clip of some of these like songs
3268209	3283261	These are songs that literally made me go WTF when I brought them up in Ultramix 3 And I actually, I got a copy of some of this music so we can play it for you guys here on the show tonight I'm not gonna play the whole one, but I wanna see if you guys have the same reaction I did to this, okay?
3283561	3288305	Imagine you're going through the song list and then suddenly you come across this, okay?
3288725	3291868	Listen to a little clip of this song, and imagine arrows coming up at the screen and all that
3293826	3294727	Okay, here's my thing.
3318357	3319841	Is that song a good song?
3319901	3321043	Yes, it's an awesome song.
3321104	3321945	It's a wonderful song.
3322006	3322888	It's an incredible song.
3322928	3323589	I love that song.
3323629	3324050	It's great.
3324491	3325955	Is it a good choice for DDR?
3326610	3328692	Hell no, it's not a good pick for DDR.
3328872	3329913	Hell no.
3330073	3330273	What?
3330554	3331895	I'm like going, eh?
3331915	3332575	I know.
3332816	3333036	I know.
3333196	3339221	And I tried playing it, and the steps were okay, considering they did the best they could with the song.
3339241	3343645	But I like playing DDR because this is one big thing that draws me to DDR.
3344025	3345387	It's like a big jukebox.
3345547	3347028	It's like the jukebox of now.
3347408	3352773	And having to play that song that sounds like it is a copy of a copy of a copy from 19-whatever...
3354334	3355594	I don't know.
3355715	3356855	I can't get into it.
3356975	3358095	I can't get into that song.
3358875	3362656	Here's another classic example.
3364717	3368038	I don't know how to describe it.
3368058	3370178	Here's another pic that was in the game.
3370638	3372399	And you tell me how I'm supposed to dance to this.
3392221	3393301	Thank you for watching!
3411505	3412866	Thank you for watching!
3427015	3429476	Here's my problem with the song list, Konami.
3430116	3432697	If it ain't broke, don't fucking fix it!
3433038	3436039	And Ultramix 2 had the best song list.
3436099	3437099	It was incredible.
3437419	3438620	It was a great song list.
3438780	3444282	All these unknowns coming from a different drum, and great transplants and remixes like Gyruss.
3444682	3444982	Awesome.
3445422	3446863	Why did they break the four?
3447383	3448944	Why did they go and try to change it?
3448984	3459268	Why were they suddenly like, oh, let's be as eclectic as we possibly can be and let's throw in The Clash for no real good reason other than we want to pay homage to The Clash.
3459688	3460108	You know what?
3460168	3465190	Let's put in Ray Charles for no good reason other than we want to pay homage to Ray Charles.
3467591	3468091	I don't get it.
3468251	3469711	Something doesn't add up for me there.
3470212	3473313	Maybe I'm just a stuck up snobby asshole when it comes to my music, but
3474548	3477570	I played those songs once and I will probably not play them again.
3477871	3482714	Which is too bad because, you know, one thing, and going back into things I like about Ultramix 3,
3483757	3504701	The steps are great, and the steps were great in Ultramix 2, and as I understand that they made changes with who's doing the steps at Konami with the other mixes on into Ultramix 2, and it was a change for the better, because they got, you know, folks that were, from what we understand and what we're hearing, folks that were in the know on their DDR making the steps.
3505121	3512023	So, and they've kept that for Ultramix 3, so that's great too, because the steps are all really cool, and they do some new things with them too, which is kind of neat.
3513383	3519568	I was almost surprised, though, that they didn't try to get steps running backward yet, because that's the only thing we haven't seen in DDR yet.
3519628	3523311	And in that Hey Mama song, there's a part where it totally could have ran backwards.
3523351	3523812	It's awesome.
3523892	3524172	I don't know.
3524252	3525473	Anyway, just a weird thought.
3525653	3533880	Actually, the whole backwards thing was an idea we tried to pitch for Ultramix 2 with the Max 300 remix, where it kind of goes... Oh, yeah.
3533940	3536222	Yeah, because it sounds like it's being played backwards.
3536482	3539124	We were trying like hell to get the engineering to work, but...
3539989	3541134	It's Hawaii we expect.
3541656	3542559	We'll get on that later.
3542660	3543162	Yeah, you know what?
3543262	3544547	I noticed this attitude of...
3545769	3572205	WTF Hawaii and I'm all about showing Hawaii a little love after Ultramix 2 and I said on this show and I do not take it back that if Konami puts out another arcade mix Hawaii should be the one doing it however I would like to go back and amend my previous statement to say whoever did Ultramix 2 should be doing it because Ultramix 3 whoever was calling the shots with the song list I'm sorry I'm not feeling the love here I'm not feeling it and there's other big big problems with Ultramix 3 now
3573860	3578384	I'm not saying Ultramix 3 is a bad game, because it's a great game, and if you own an Xbox, you should be fucking buying this game.
3578424	3578764	You should.
3579224	3580165	There's no question about it.
3580505	3583588	But there are some problems that really make me go WTF.
3583668	3585690	Here is another huge-ass problem.
3586570	3591734	The song packs from Ultramix 2 are horribly off-sync.
3592795	3593636	Don't believe me?
3594957	3595618	Check this out.
3596718	3599581	I have proof that the songs are off-sync.
3601621	3605543	because there might be people out there that say, oh, Ram, you're just playing on your TV.
3605564	3606584	You just think they're off sync.
3606644	3608665	It feels like you're off sync because you're not hitting the buttons at the right time.
3608745	3609886	No, no, no.
3610346	3610867	I have proof.
3611187	3618171	What I did is I took the song into training mode and put it on with claps so you can hear exactly where the arrows fall in the song.
3618412	3618932	Listen to this.
3642793	3649155	Wait, hold on, I want you to listen to that part carefully again, because those notes are supposed to go with that when it comes at that do-do-do-do-do-do-do.
3649495	3654797	Listen, the claps start like almost a full second before it really happens.
3654897	3655377	Listen again.
3661759	3664099	Now, listen to this next part coming up with the freezes.
3664599	3666020	All the notes are on the upbeats.
3666060	3666440	Watch this.
3676058	3678099	Those steps are supposed to be on the sirens.
3678439	3679139	You get my picture?
3679419	3686141	Wow, I totally feel like I'm flashback to two years ago QAing Ultramix 1, where it was horribly long.
3686181	3690362	Well, apparently somebody forgot to QA the second song packs or something.
3690482	3690842	I don't know.
3691163	3695784	But now the community who paid five bucks for those songs, hoping that they get to play them on Ultramix 3, they're pissed!
3696581	3713816	They're pissed because they can't play those songs in Ultramix 3, they're ruined We were doing, we played, I was playing on live the other day with people, I don't know these people, they're just random people on live That song came up, we did like a random pick, I don't know, and that song came up and we played that on live And everybody was like, what the fuck, this song is fucked, what happened to this?
3714376	3723324	Babe, now you know why we have such a huge freaking timing window in Ultramix That was Disabled the Flaw, by the way, from Songpack 9, if you don't believe me
3726189	3753406	so there it is, audio proof that the damn thing is off sync and they should put out a patch, now the community is saying you gotta patch it, you gotta patch it, put out a patch I'm wondering if they can put out a patch, the game's probably not built to take a patch, I don't know because like Halo's different, when you go to Halo, Halo connects to the internet right away and if it sees the patch it gets it if DDR was not set up to do that, you're not going to be able to get a patch that easy so I don't know, I don't know what they're going to do, I doubt they're going to do anything
3754482	3755383	You can patch a game like that.
3755423	3759045	Just like they patched WWE WrestleMania 21.
3759105	3761807	They can do a patch on that.
3763688	3763948	Alright.
3765269	3765629	Here we go.
3765709	3766770	I want to play this as well.
3766790	3768251	This is the other thing that pisses me off.
3768291	3771173	And once again, I have audio proof that this pisses me off.
3771213	3772394	And you cannot dispute this.
3773795	3774275	You cannot.
3776156	3776877	Here's my beef.
3778271	3781112	Loading times in Ultramix series have been kind of iffy as it is.
3782412	3784713	Now I would like to show you what it's like to load the game.
3784773	3789314	Now I'm not even counting in the beginning, the game loads up, you get to the title screen.
3789954	3793555	What happens is that then there's a moment where it goes, loading songpacks.
3794015	3798576	And you have to wait, and you see these little bubble animations on the screen while it's loading your songpacks, which is okay.
3799614	3805618	makes sense, that's how, even though the songpacks are off sync and not worth loading anyway, this is how it, you know, brings them into the game.
3805879	3813884	However, I would like to play for you guys, this is a direct audio rip, I am not fudging anything here, this is a direct audio rip from earlier today, when I was booting up the game and playing.
3814205	3819568	So you're gonna hear the title music for just a minute, and then you're gonna hear a bloop bloop, that is the game starting to load, after I hit the A button.
3819789	3823231	And I'm not gonna shorten this or anything, this is seriously how long the load time is.
3825813	3828475	Okay, so here's a little tile screen, okay, and then here we go.
3841850	3844252	Goddammit, Rob, stop farting in the bathtub!
3844272	3858204	It's been about... let's see... 30 seconds.
3863949	3865310	I think I'll go get up and make a sandwich.
3865971	3868653	Little bit longer than William Hung's stardom.
3880952	3882013	That is a tasty burger.
3883194	3886716	I wonder if my game's gonna load any day now.
3888718	3891640	Wow, I'd really like to play some DDR today.
3892861	3893061	Oh!
3893121	3893681	There we go!
3893941	3894482	Finally!
3894782	3896003	The goddamn thing loaded!
3896083	3896583	Finally!
3897604	3899185	One minute, five seconds.
3900126	3904729	One whole minute for the goddamn songpacks to load and they don't even work!
3907845	3916811	Needless to say, if that's going to be the case, importing the songpacks probably should have been an option that you could choose to do before you go into the game.
3917332	3917692	I don't know.
3918012	3920054	Or maybe just optimize your thing a little better.
3920154	3920474	I don't know.
3920694	3922375	You know, they say that DDR is exercise.
3922395	3926498	This exercise would be screaming at the freaking console for it to load faster.
3928199	3929480	That is just crazy.
3929760	3931422	Exercise and patience.
3931642	3931842	Yeah.
3935100	3936381	Welcome to DDR!
3936461	3938261	Now we're gonna exercise your patience!
3939842	3940442	Jesus.
3945625	3945905	Anyway.
3946225	3947386	I don't know what else to say about that.
3947446	3947926	Come on!
3949006	3949287	Alright.
3949607	3951267	So I'm dogging on the game a little bit.
3951908	3954329	All in all, though, it's not bad.
3954489	3957270	I just liked Ultramix 2 a little bit better.
3957850	3958751	Mel, what are your thoughts?
3959909	3962970	Well, I guess I liked it better because I was on Ultramix 2.
3963390	3963810	Who knows?
3964130	3965431	It's a curse, perhaps.
3966051	3978195	No, but just from, I guess, talking to people who are on the project and such, I think either Hawaii or RMC, spending a little too much time on things that were...
3979119	3984683	Not all that crucial, like, I heard quest mode got way too much more attention than it really needed to be.
3985524	3987486	Oh, god, I didn't even mention quest mode.
3987506	3994912	I mean, quest mode is... I mean, I guess it's cute, but the thing, the setup in EX2 was way better.
3994952	3997774	Whatever that thing was, I don't even remember what it was, mission mode or whatever, it was way better.
3998414	3999996	That's what I expected quest mode was gonna be.
4000496	4003939	I didn't realize quest mode was just, play a lot of DDR and get shit.
4004199	4005460	That's basically what quest mode is.
4005720	4024318	Yeah, and, like, there's so many bugs you can do to, like, gain more, you know, points or, you know, money or whatever, like, you can actually load your own edits into it, and, like, what they did was, they would do, like, all 16ths in, like, a circle pattern, so you just sit there and you rub the controller, boom, you know, so you jack up the, you know, points hardcore, um...
4025521	4030709	Other than that, I mean, like, song list, I think it's sort of like, it's kind of like the iPod shuffle theory.
4030749	4035756	They think, wow, if we can get it as broad as possible, we're going to look that much cooler, you know, but...
4036697	4039740	At the risk of alienating your fanbase that supported you through Ultramix 2.
4040180	4058936	Basically, I mean, you know, I know they want to be different, it's a good thing, you know, I mean, Ultramix, you know, has its own identity for the most part, but... Let's face it, we had to forgive Hawaii an awful lot for Ultramix 1, and then, you know, for Ultramix 2, it was like, okay, guys, okay, you proved yourselves with Ultramix 2, we're cool, we can be a happy family, just don't disappoint us again.
4059236	4062119	And then, pfft, song list was woo!
4062299	4064581	Is it gonna be like Madden, where every other year it's good?
4065106	4066167	and every other year it sucks.
4066207	4067308	It's like the Star Treks.
4067389	4068730	The even number ones are good.
4071373	4071773	We'll see.
4072734	4073815	Con!
4074556	4074997	Shut up.
4075417	4075838	All of you.
4077640	4078941	Stop ruining this station.
4079061	4079361	Alright.
4079862	4080523	Anything else, Mel?
4081143	4082365	I don't know.
4082405	4082665	I think
4083206	4086249	You know, like, did they just put a little too much into the game?
4086269	4089151	You know, just like, there's that whole dance, you know, freestyle mode and all that?
4089492	4095577	I think they could have done without, you know, most of it's like, spend more time on, you know, the actual gameplay stuff on the timing windows and all that.
4095617	4099281	I mean, granted, it's not as big as, like, Alaska now, you know.
4099561	4101683	It's not as big as Nevada, you know.
4102123	4107068	But, um... Well, I think maybe it's the kind of thing where they're like, well, they're not gonna notice it.
4107985	4108705	Whoops!
4109086	4111727	You forgot how rabid these DDR freaks can be.
4111827	4112647	Yes, we're going to notice.
4112907	4114808	Engineers don't notice it.
4114968	4116509	The QA people do.
4116949	4120111	The stuff they have on there, they know there's stuff.
4120151	4123952	I have a feeling that they knew some of this stuff was going on.
4125353	4126193	I don't know.
4126253	4128234	I can't speculate too much.
4129155	4131816	I don't know if it's just reticence or laziness or what.
4131916	4135698	I ain't going to say one way or another because I haven't nearly been close to the situation.
4136358	4136618	But
4137383	4142107	You know, overall, hey, you know, they figure DDR, it's Xbox, it has to sell.
4143048	4143328	I know.
4143768	4154397	I just hope when they do Ultramix 4 or Xbox 360 DDR, whatever's next for them, assuming there's going to be another mix, which there has to be, I can't see DDR dying just because the song list pissed me off.
4155038	4156779	I want there to be another mix.
4157039	4158981	The mix overall isn't bad.
4159101	4159441	It's not.
4159481	4160442	It's a good game, again.
4160462	4160962	I'm just saying that.
4160982	4162844	It's just these little things make me mad.
4163865	4166427	But when they do the future mix, I just, you know,
4169360	4171642	I hope they stick with the things that worked for them in Ultimix 2.
4174084	4174684	What else can I say?
4174724	4175024	I don't know.
4175604	4177606	I would like to see them shake up the interface a little more, too.
4177646	4183229	Ultimix 3 felt like Ultimix 2 Plus in a lot of ways, because they didn't really change the interface except the bubbles.
4183850	4191275	And I'm okay with the bubbles thing, but where the bubbles thing got awful was the little reflections of the bubbles blocked the graphics.
4191515	4196138	It's like, okay, somebody in the art department wasn't thinking that whole thing out or something.
4196158	4196478	I don't know.
4197042	4197702	So, whatever.
4199243	4199744	Anyway.
4201885	4203326	Any other comments from anybody on Ultramix 3?
4204367	4205688	You guys asleep over here?
4205948	4207108	Mario Kart over here, Loki?
4207129	4210691	Hey, I haven't played Ultramix 3, so I can't comment.
4210891	4215274	Other than that some of the music is really weird.
4216324	4223890	I almost want to, you know, say, oh, what the hell, I'll, you know, go ahead and get it because I have 1 and 2 sitting at home also.
4223930	4227573	Is the online mode any better than Extreme 2's online mode?
4227593	4228774	Oh, the online mode is incredible.
4228814	4229834	The online mode is great.
4229874	4231015	It's the best online VR yet.
4231035	4234678	Does it still have tournament mode in there where you can run a tournament on it?
4234878	4236880	I think so, but I'm going to be honest, I didn't really look.
4239061	4239582	Okay.
4240923	4241143	All right.
4242214	4243636	We're going to go to another break, you guys.
4243676	4249461	When we come back from this break, you guys will have a chance to give your thoughts on Ultramix 3 and anything else that's on your mind.
4249501	4253104	I know we have some folks that want to talk about this MTV taping some of them went to on the East Coast.
4253404	4254585	They want to call in and talk about this.
4254986	4256647	Some other random stories you guys want to talk about.
4256767	4259830	It's your show when we come back from this break and we open up the sky blind.
4259870	4261432	Was it Orange Lounge goes to...
4262092	4263293	Orange Lounge Goes to the Movies
4293400	4294241	Thank you for watching!
4379393	4380395	Thanks for watching!
4409677	4411599	Lyrics, Lyrics, Lyrics
4498743	4499664	Thank you for watching!
4629398	4643803	All the life, all the life, all the life we're living I just wanna live Don't really care about the things that we say Don't really care about what others are saying I just wanna live
4655535	4656655	Thanks for watching!
4699309	4703192	Orange Lounge Radio, Bomani Music, and more.
4703313	4703633	Perfect!
4706786	4723416	Hi kids, we're back here on Orange Lounge Radio, and in that break you heard some more music from the DDR Ultramix 3, including Conflict by the Azoic, Why by Neveraka, Rock Lobster by the B-52s, and I Just Wanna Live by Good Charlotte's on that mix.
4723476	4727118	So, you know, I was a little iffy with Good Charlotte being an Ultramix, but...
4728934	4729515	DDR Ultramix 3
4757964	4762686	Oh, as you know, I've always been a huge supporter of the Ultramix series.
4762726	4764327	Your volume just went down by half.
4764367	4765788	I don't know if you moved your microphone.
4765828	4766248	There we go.
4767489	4767889	Try it again.
4769530	4770590	Now we can't hear you at all.
4771911	4773551	I think... Is that better?
4773571	4773972	There we go.
4773992	4774572	Yes, much better.
4774672	4774972	What's up?
4776213	4783016	Okay, I've always been a huge supporter, but this mix kind of dropped the bomb in a lot of areas.
4784031	4785311	Come on and drop the bomb!
4788392	4789132	Alright, I'm kidding.
4789992	4791012	You know I couldn't resist.
4791753	4792833	Why did it drop the bomb?
4793793	4797794	Well, for one, they added a bunch of rock songs that we didn't need to hear.
4799174	4799734	I'll give you that.
4800254	4806556	I understand, like, NoFX and The Clash wanting to pay homage to them, but I don't think they really worked for DDR.
4807076	4808616	I didn't get that, but...
4809571	4814195	Yeah, but mostly I think the song pack thing is completely unforgivable.
4814535	4815697	I don't get that at all.
4815917	4818099	Did you hear the little audio clip I played earlier?
4818652	4825194	Yeah, and I've been playing, I've been trying to play songs, and a lot of them are songs I've loved, like Diamond Jealousy and R5.
4825815	4827915	And yeah, it's not just limited to like three songs.
4827976	4837699	I know Rini compiled some stuff and put it on the DDR Freak forum, and probably half the other forums out there on the internet, and it's got like Jack and Mark Get Busy and all these other songs.
4837719	4840740	I mean, it's like a list of like ten songs that are broken in the song packs.
4840900	4841981	It's sucky.
4842561	4843321	It's ridiculous.
4843741	4845662	It's completely unprofessional in my opinion.
4845882	4846803	Yeah, it sucks.
4847183	4847543	It sucks.
4849300	4850180	How did they miss that?
4850240	4850901	That's what I want to know.
4850941	4853603	It's like somebody didn't even test to see if the songpacks worked.
4853943	4854303	I don't know.
4854363	4855104	How do you miss that?
4855765	4856285	I don't know.
4857466	4858967	Or they knew about it and just didn't give a shit.
4859067	4859387	I don't know.
4860568	4861369	Something like that.
4861429	4861869	Who knows?
4862269	4862650	What else?
4862730	4864211	Any other thoughts you have on Ultimix 3?
4865592	4871536	A lot of things I like is a bunch of songs like So Many Times, which I absolutely love.
4872437	4875219	I think we have that queued for the next break, so we'll play that, definitely.
4876024	4879246	Yeah, the steps are really good this time.
4879886	4886069	The steps are all pretty good, especially when you consider that there are some songs where it's like, you know, this shouldn't even be in DDR.
4886770	4889111	The steps, they do the best they can, you know what I mean?
4889711	4897956	Yeah, like even the songs that aren't made for DDR, like Meowma and all that, they're just fun to play, so...
4898813	4905194	I, I, I just, whereas the steps are good, I'm not going to knock the steps because they do the best they can.
4905294	4908755	It's not fun to play because the song makes my ears want to, you know, scream out in pain.
4909115	4910255	I can't, I can't play it.
4910675	4910895	So.
4910915	4920517	Um, besides that, um, I'm kind of iffy about the online because it's a lot better this time.
4921197	4925138	I think the online is like the best part too, is like they really improved online support.
4926075	4933440	But the scoring is still a little iffy, because if you get a full combo, you instantly win, which is really annoying.
4935462	4943307	Because, you know, I've been through, like, multiple players already where they've gotten 50 greats and I've gotten 7, and I lose, and I'm like, what the fuck?!
4944028	4945348	Why, because you didn't get a full combo?
4946069	4950132	Yeah, I, like, got a miss because the controller for Xbox is completely CBR.
4952239	4961627	Yeah, I don't know if it's keeping track of my win-loss record appropriately, but I do like the fact that it shows on the little preview what your highest score is.
4961787	4964670	Because in my case, I have a triple-A, so my highest score is a perfect score.
4964910	4967853	And it shows how many triple-As and how many double-As you have, which I think is kind of cool.
4967893	4968974	That's kind of neat.
4969014	4969614	Yeah, I like that.
4969654	4970095	That's funny.
4971556	4972016	Okay.
4972136	4972677	Besides that.
4973057	4975700	Well, anything else you want to share about the mix, Jess, before I get to another call?
4977081	4977381	Instead.
4977708	4981429	Perfectly good to me, besides all the crap that's messed up.
4981910	4983070	Yeah, alright.
4983130	4984290	On a scale of 1 to 10?
4987091	4984290	7.
4987512	4987872	Alright.
4988532	4989172	Take care, Jazz.
4989192	4989832	Thanks for calling in.
4989892	4990833	Have a good one, okay?
4991513	4992233	Have a nice day.
4992353	4992754	Later.
4993434	4993714	Bye.
4994134	4995915	Alright, let's go to another call.
4996055	4997855	We are getting hammered tonight, boys and girls.
4997895	4998956	We may not get to all the calls.
4999076	5000917	I'm really sorry, but we're going to try our best, okay?
5001477	5002837	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
5003958	5005278	Hi, Sephiroth 1215 here.
5005418	5006339	Hi, Sephiroth 1215.
5006699	5007379	What's on your mind, buddy?
5009364	5010065	Just two things.
5010105	5016407	First of all, about Ultra Mix 3 really quickly, it's pretty good.
5016467	5022130	I mean, first of all, I say I do like The Clash a lot, so I appreciate that song a lot more.
5022590	5024091	But is it a good DDR song?
5026292	5027232	It seems kind of fit.
5027252	5028032	It's really catchy.
5028192	5028613	Alright.
5028873	5031694	I guess that's just where people have difference of opinion, but okay.
5033504	5061637	But otherwise, alright, they do have a lot of problems But the whole loading time thing, it's the same thing in the other Ultramix games It's just they don't have the loading screen Maybe that's what it is, it doesn't feel like it's so long in the other games Or maybe it's because there's not as many songpacks they're trying to import or something, I don't know Like I knew in Ultramix 2 it was kind of a little bit slow But, I don't know, you just didn't feel it, it wasn't a minute long It seems like it's really bad in this one, I don't know, maybe it's just me
5063601	5068406	Yeah, and quote from PoPanda21 is, she loves the bubbles.
5070188	5074692	The bubbles, I'm okay with the bubbles theme, but I just think it could have been better.
5074893	5077095	Like, it could have been executed better, the bubbles.
5077355	5079638	But anyway, this isn't about me, this is about your thoughts.
5079898	5080398	I'll shut up.
5081880	5082280	Alright, um...
5083646	5088250	But otherwise, I went to the MTV taping on Tuesday.
5089432	5090152	Now what was this for?
5090172	5091233	The MTV taping for what?
5091293	5092795	Gamesores or whatever it is they're doing?
5093636	5096679	Yeah, it's Gameores Week, which is pretty lame.
5096899	5097580	Gameores.
5099181	5100562	God bless MTV.
5101163	5102284	God bless them.
5103145	5103826	Alright, how was it?
5103866	5104426	What'd they do?
5104486	5106708	What can you expect on Gameores Week?
5110385	5111966	Honestly, really not much.
5112786	5115308	I mean, I was kind of psyched up at first.
5115528	5124993	I was waiting on line to get in, and I was in front of the line, so she's like, oh, you know, you first six or seven people, you come into the gaming room.
5125033	5127554	So I'm like, all right, gaming room is going to be awesome.
5128174	5129955	But then we get there.
5130475	5131096	It looks cool.
5131136	5132456	They have nice TVs and everything.
5132496	5133037	They have a 360 set up.
5133097	5133657	Like one 360?
5134758	5134918	Yeah.
5137779	5139801	I bet she doesn't even know what a 360 is.
5139821	5141583	It just matches her purse, that cunt.
5141603	5142083	Anyway, sorry.
5142103	5144265	It was a 360 with only one controller.
5157950	5160392	Well, again, didn't you hear about the shortage problems?
5161252	5162993	Now we're going to play a 32-player deathmatch.
5163194	5164835	Go!
5165915	5168537	It's like Mario Party 7, where it splits up the controller.
5169438	5179104	Okay, now, Sephiroth 1215, you get a button, and this guy over here, you get a button, and you get a button, and suddenly it's like the Oprah show, and you get a button, and you get a button, and you get a button!
5180565	5181626	Sorry, that was really random.
5181646	5181946	I'm sorry.
5181966	5182266	Go ahead.
5183887	5187149	It doesn't even matter, because the batteries die in the controller anyway.
5191468	5192269	Good game.
5192389	5193330	GG, MTV.
5193730	5194190	GG.
5195351	5204216	And they didn't do much, so they just gave a fake controller and just said, pretend to play to the person who was there.
5206397	5206737	Wow.
5207938	5210280	I was the one sitting there playing a stupid Frogger game.
5211440	5212801	You got to play the new Frogger game?
5213582	5214262	Yeah.
5214322	5215102	There's a Frogger game?
5215142	5215423	Is this on 360?
5217364	5218865	No, the original Xbox.
5219085	5219165	Oh.
5220552	5223073	Wait, what the hell is this thing all about?
5223113	5223633	It's not about the 360.
5224233	5225374	What is this show all about?
5226394	5229935	It's just trying to do something for gamers.
5229995	5230455	I don't know.
5230615	5237658	The question everyone wants to know is why is anyone playing Frogger Ancient Shadows?
5237678	5238458	That's what I want to know.
5239178	5241379	Yet another reason to hate Konami of Hawaii.
5242139	5243120	Did they do that game too?
5243140	5246664	Man, Hawaii lives off Frogger, dude, like nobody's business.
5246764	5247625	Dude, people buy it.
5247865	5248325	You know why?
5248365	5250227	Because it ends up in the $10 bin at Walmart.
5250327	5252429	And people go, oh, I'm going to get Frogger for my grandson.
5252870	5253851	I remember Frogger.
5253871	5254872	I remember Frogger.
5255713	5256533	That's a hip game.
5256554	5258175	That's a bee's knees, that game.
5259795	5260335	Anyway, sorry.
5260575	5262796	Was Frogger the bee's knees?
5264396	5267677	It was a pretty bad game, but whatever, I was stuck playing it.
5269557	5274538	The other games were like, I think Pac-Man World 3, and then Ultimate Spider-Man.
5274858	5277319	Oh, I'm glad they threw the Ultimate Spider-Man in there.
5277339	5279299	I was like, did they get confused?
5279339	5283260	Did they go off a list of what's hot 1980 or something?
5285820	5288321	Somebody tell MTV that they got Pac-Man fever.
5289267	5290148	Um, forget it.
5290649	5296636	Um, you know Rob, I actually, um, crap, I forgot to bring you a copy of Pac-World 3.
5297938	5298819	It's okay, it can wait.
5299199	5301842	I had four of them, two of them have been returned already.
5302663	5307389	You know, I actually was at Applebee's the other day and heard Pac-Man Fever on the radio and I was like, I thought this song died with it.
5307529	5308731	Oh wait, I'm sorry, we have a caller online.
5310601	5311661	Are we going to see you on TV?
5312801	5314422	Uh, yeah.
5314442	5316262	Did you flash the OLR gang sign?
5318423	5326624	No, unfortunately, you know, we couldn't really do much, first of all, but if you had an OLR shirt, I would definitely wear it.
5326784	5328205	I know, I keep hearing that.
5328325	5332165	If you only had the OLR shirt, we're working on it.
5332245	5335386	We need what's called, what do you call it, like a seed money.
5335766	5338647	We need money to buy the shirts, and then we can sell them.
5338727	5339147	So that's what...
5340607	5342288	We do have $25, that's true.
5342308	5342728	We won $25.
5342988	5345930	Anyway, anything else you want to say about the MTV taping?
5347310	5354053	Yeah, there was a brief second half where it was like the actual filming for the countdown they had.
5355094	5356934	We got free sports games.
5358135	5358515	Yay.
5358895	5361276	Yay, which in turn I bet you turned around and sold.
5361356	5365738	Did they give you like FIFA and like Top Spin or virtual tennis?
5365798	5367559	All those games that are huge in the U.S.,
5369205	5372808	Actually, we got NBA 06 and Madden 06.
5373468	5374129	I mean, 05.
5375490	5376090	Madden 05?
5376651	5378632	You got 05 games.
5378652	5381975	You're unloading the surplus on you guys before they bury them in New Mexico.
5383254	5385115	Oh, wait, wait, sorry, it is 06.
5385175	5385916	Oh, it is 06, okay.
5385996	5387697	I'm a bit behind on that.
5388218	5389038	It still sucks!
5389158	5390539	Madden's done!
5390760	5392961	I mean, give me Genesis Madden!
5393522	5395183	I'd have rather had Madden 05 than 06.
5396644	5396904	Anyway.
5397765	5401367	It's alright, though, because I took them, I went down to Walmart and got full credit for them.
5401467	5402088	There you go!
5402448	5403909	There you go, good man, good man.
5404389	5408092	Alright, we've got to let you go because we've got to get to other calls, but thank you for telling us what's going on.
5408392	5410354	Now, what are you wearing on the show so we can spot you?
5411478	5412900	I'm wearing a DDR Freak shirt.
5413460	5413760	All right.
5414081	5416663	Even though you're promoting the competition.
5416703	5417124	No, I'm kidding.
5417144	5417904	We love DDR Freak.
5418144	5418645	That's great.
5419025	5419346	All right.
5420126	5423629	By the way, the show is Direct Effect.
5424290	5424891	Direct Effect.
5424911	5425952	Tomorrow and Tuesday.
5426212	5427013	Tomorrow and Tuesday.
5427073	5427493	What time?
5429195	5429555	Over here.
5429595	5431297	I know it's on a thing at 7 maybe.
5431497	5431797	All right.
5431957	5433979	But either way, just look for Direct Effect.
5434250	5437331	I'll be sure to set my TiVo.
5438912	5439512	Take care, buddy.
5439552	5439912	Have a good one.
5439932	5440372	Thanks for calling.
5440852	5441153	You too.
5441173	5441353	Bye.
5441413	5441573	Later.
5455231	5458053	I gotta mute the Windows Media Player.
5458233	5458453	Okay.
5458493	5458813	I can't.
5459714	5460014	We'll wait.
5460094	5460794	You can put us on hold.
5460894	5461335	We'll wait.
5462455	5463796	Yeah, don't use Windows Media Player.
5463836	5464256	Jesus.
5466818	5467078	Anyway.
5468119	5468959	What's on your mind, buddy?
5469339	5470380	Who is this, first off?
5470760	5471941	This is Xander from Florida.
5472121	5473362	Hello, Xander from Florida.
5474102	5474562	What's on your mind?
5477684	5478785	Dang, this is driving me crazy.
5479945	5482467	Actually, I wanted to bring up the Guitar Freaks.
5483769	5485670	Now, are we talking Guitar Freaks or Guitar Hero?
5486310	5487151	Oh, Guitar Hero, sorry.
5487171	5488151	Okay, what's up with Guitar Hero?
5489092	5506121	Well, actually, I was trying to figure out if I should save my money and go for Beatmania when it comes out, or... Well, here's the way we see it, is that Guitar Hero is out now and costs, what, 70 bucks, I think is how much Guitar Hero costs?
5506581	5506881	Right.
5506901	5511924	Beatmania is out, what, the last date we heard is February 8th, I think is what we heard for Beatmania?
5511944	5512164	February 8th.
5512921	5515942	February 10th to February 8th, sometime in early February is when that's coming out.
5516263	5519924	We don't know how much it's going to cost for sure, but let's say it's about the same, $70.
5520204	5521645	That would seem pretty reasonable, okay?
5522085	5525747	So the thing is, can you save $70 between now and February?
5528075	5528936	Thanks for watching!
5546337	5552904	It feels more like you're playing an actual guitar as opposed to holding something that looks like a guitar and pushing these buttons.
5553244	5555827	Really the five button thing really adds a lot to it.
5556027	5566919	And what they do is they do this thing with the fret buttons where you can actually push the fret buttons and it's hard for me to explain but you can push the buttons in order and get the different sounds.
5567359	5568740	which you couldn't do on Guitar Freaks.
5568760	5571942	You had to be holding the exact right button combinations or the damn thing didn't work.
5572562	5576185	And, you know, they did an awesome job in the art direction department.
5576225	5585411	Let's face it, Guitar Freaks was cool for about the first 75 mixes, but now that they're on, you know, whatever they're on, like Guitar Freaks, Super Duper, Second Mix, whatever they're on.
5585751	5586131	V2.
5586532	5587252	V2, thank you.
5587272	5588193	Okay, whatever the hell they're on.
5588573	5590374	It's the same damn game.
5590474	5591675	Nothing has been changed.
5591715	5593036	It's the same damn interface.
5593436	5596418	Even though they went up to PlayStation 2, it's the same game.
5596678	5598800	I don't watch the videos when I play the game!
5608661	5623056	If you like songs, if you like the J-pop, happy, go lucky, yeah, yeah, yeah songs, then Guitar Freaks is going to be the better game because Guitar Hero is filled with good old-fashioned American butt rock is what's in Guitar Hero.
5623536	5626860	And so if you like the butt rock, you're going to like this game.
5626880	5629282	When I say butt rock, I mean like, you know, Pantera.
5629302	5629643	If I don't...
5630243	5631884	If I don't like that kind of rock, then well...
5660804	5662925	So, I don't know.
5662965	5666367	It's just people saying wonderful things about the song list.
5666447	5669089	I'm like, well, you know, what if I don't like that style of music?
5669109	5670350	Then you're not going to like Guitar Hero.
5670810	5672892	And it's pretty easy to find the song list.
5673152	5675914	If you go to GuitarHeroGame.com, that's the website.
5675934	5678936	They've got a song list right on the website, so it's not hard to find it.
5679315	5698991	But if you are into the Japanese, like if you like trance and stuff, Beatmania, hell, Beatmania's, I don't, we don't know what songs for sure are going to be Beatmania, I mean, we know a few here and there, but rest assured, if it's like any of the other past, what, 1500 mixes they've had in Japan, you're going to have your happy trance and some J-pop, and if that's the kind of music you're into, Beatmania's worth that.
5700933	5701193	Okay.
5701433	5702514	Alright, have fun.
5703695	5704616	Yeah, you too.
5704696	5708099	Keep supporting them music games, because starving programmers need your money, okay?
5710410	5711471	Yeah, and Roxo's getting it.
5711971	5712311	All right.
5712832	5714012	Well, wait, no, no, no, no, no.
5714573	5715954	Oh, wait, Roxo, oh, for In the Groove?
5716574	5716794	Yeah.
5716894	5718155	Oh, that's a whole nother thing, man.
5718175	5718935	That's a whole nother topic.
5718956	5719196	I know.
5719216	5720657	I brought it up like a month ago.
5720677	5720857	I know.
5721037	5722898	You think I remember each of these shows?
5722938	5724759	Please, with all the drugs I do, come on.
5725520	5725920	Just kidding.
5725940	5726480	Just kidding, kids.
5726500	5726941	Don't do drugs.
5726961	5728842	All right, we're going to let you go so we can get to another call, all right?
5729742	5729963	Okay.
5729983	5730563	All right, have a good one.
5731423	5731684	You too.
5731764	5731944	Later.
5733979	5734559	Rockstar sucks.
5734839	5735220	No, I'm kidding.
5735520	5737360	I just had to drop that.
5737420	5738381	No, I'm kidding, I'm kidding.
5739561	5741222	I just wanted to make somebody angry.
5741582	5746464	No, you know, in the groove is okay.
5747825	5749845	I'd like to mention I said nothing.
5750766	5751566	You were a good boy.
5751706	5752607	You were a very good boy, Loki.
5752647	5753047	No, no, no.
5753087	5754027	Keep playing Mario Kart.
5754067	5756068	It's keeping you quiet over there.
5756488	5759669	I've got almost all the races beat in 150cc.
5761631	5768133	I have to say, I'm strangely looking forward to In the Group 2 on a home console.
5768373	5773094	I think if they fix a lot of things, I don't know, it might be neat.
5773474	5773854	We'll see.
5774434	5775914	It'd be neat when they get sued.
5776014	5776674	Oh, stop it.
5777555	5778275	Let's go to another call.
5779115	5780795	Let's go to this one.
5781135	5782076	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
5783476	5784576	Hey, Sky, speaking here.
5784856	5787037	Hello, oh, it's our resident 2DX whore.
5787077	5787737	How are you doing?
5788632	5789813	Don't you mean 2DX Bastard?
5789833	5790173	Oh, that's right.
5790193	5791553	You're a 2DX Bastard, not a whore.
5791574	5791974	I'm sorry.
5793374	5796256	Whores imply you're getting paid, which you're not.
5796536	5797897	You're actually spending a lot of money.
5798057	5800338	That makes you... I don't know what that makes you, but what's on your mind?
5801058	5805821	Well, as of last Tuesday, I finally got my copy of Beat Me 2DX 10th Style.
5806421	5807221	Yay!
5807862	5808362	How is it?
5809222	5810503	It's really great.
5811484	5817747	As a matter of fact, I would like to have my input on... I'd like to give my input on those 7 TS exclusives.
5818547	5820287	Go for it.
5820347	5825348	First up is Taito no Suika by Burme Inazawa featuring Shimotsuki Haruka.
5826028	5833990	The another I would give, you know, on a scale of level 1 to level 12, which level 12 is the most difficult, the another I would give it a level 10.
5835130	5835430	Okay.
5836930	5841071	Next up is, you know, Jelly Kiss Midian Smack Mix.
5842531	5844672	On 7Key, it stays as it is, it's level 7.
5845792	5847995	On the another, I would give it a level 10.
5849037	5849677	Pretty hard, huh?
5850258	5850719	Pretty hard.
5852461	5854063	I have to ask you, what do you think about that anyway?
5854083	5856887	Because you're pretty loyal to all the Japanese mixes that come out.
5856907	5860652	What do you think about that US song crossing over into Japan?
5860672	5861373	What do you think about that?
5861874	5863334	I was quite surprised, actually.
5863615	5864615	Yeah, I was surprised, too.
5864675	5871317	But we actually have an interview with MiniHead in this week's podcast, and it's pretty interesting because I kind of ask him right about this, too.
5871417	5873478	So you'll have to tune in to hear what he has to say.
5873578	5874118	So it's kind of neat.
5874338	5876619	Anyway, go ahead.
5876979	5877379	Let's see.
5877519	5878219	Hype the core?
5878239	5880180	On 7K, I would give it a level 9.
5883761	5886382	On the another, it should be a level 12.
5886602	5887863	It's really the hardest one.
5889163	5889923	Wow.
5891444	5895145	Exian, yeah, I did a Tatsujin video on that.
5895986	5899667	You know, what's really weird is it doesn't really look like a level 8.
5900888	5901888	I should really give it a level 7.
5902848	5903128	Really?
5904029	5904269	Yeah.
5904729	5909371	I like hearing that, though, because that means it'll be a hard song I can beat.
5909691	5912612	And on the another, I give it a level 8, as it is.
5915142	5920346	Um, let's see, what else, uh, Satellite020712 from Coded Arms.
5921748	5927052	Um, it's level 8, it stays as it is, on 7 key, on the another, I give it a level 11.
5927092	5927312	Okay.
5927372	5930615	Yeah, you didn't know they had Coded Arms in there?
5931115	5932236	No, I didn't.
5932416	5933277	I turned off the mic.
5933317	5939482	I didn't realize they had that, no, what they needed was, um, I want to say it was Radar Rider, something like that, or, um.
5941274	5942675	They're crossing over from their other franchises.
5942795	5943176	Good stuff.
5943216	5945598	They had Rumble Roses music in Ultramix 3.
5946018	5946378	That's good.
5946638	5946959	Interesting.
5947019	5947879	Anyway, go ahead.
5949661	5956986	Let me check my tent style here and give my personal opinion on the 7 CS exclusives.
5957146	5959468	How many CS exclusives have I already mentioned so far?
5959488	5962270	I don't know, Suica and Satellite 00712?
5966553	5969775	I think you're missing Strong Woman and... Strong Woman, oh yeah.
5970335	5973137	I give it, you know, on the another, I give it a level 8.
5974657	5974958	Okay.
5975898	5977079	Because of the chords.
5977639	5982141	Even though it's 95 BPM, which is really, really slow, I had a rough time.
5982422	5983542	Sounds a little bit like War Game.
5984823	5985063	Yeah.
5985083	5985463	A little bit.
5985623	5985823	Okay.
5985843	5986764	A little bit.
5987144	5991807	And I think the last one, hmm, what was it again?
5992827	5994068	Oh, Acid Vision, here we go.
5994088	5995809	Oh, very, very good song.
5996654	6001952	level 8 stays as it is on 7 key and on the another I give it a level 10
6002894	6003114	Alright.
6003915	6005595	What are your thoughts about TenStyle overall?
6006536	6007896	Oh, it's really, really good.
6009297	6016060	They just, you know, they just released, you know, they just put in a judge mode in which you can see how many perfect grades and greets that you have.
6017480	6017960	What else?
6018581	6024863	They have, you know, the DJ point, and yeah, Sakurina, one more lovely, Onage.
6026364	6026744	Alright.
6028245	6030165	Any other words for our listeners before we let you go?
6030185	6031386	We've got to get to another call, but...
6032281	6035903	Well, I just want to say, go get TenStyle.
6036783	6037103	Alright.
6038324	6041225	I actually plan on getting it as soon as I get a new controller.
6041645	6042405	Which will be very soon.
6042685	6048168	Because I've heard the rumors that Konami's putting out a new one for the US, as I'm sure we all have, but we'll see.
6048248	6049728	And if it's true, I'm definitely getting one.
6050269	6050589	So we'll see.
6051519	6060204	Go watch my Tatsujin videos, Desolation Another, Don't Forget Another, and the Exe in 70 that I did.
6060444	6068128	I'll post it online, the site that has the Tatsujin videos that I have.
6068349	6069549	Absolutely, put a link in our chatroom.
6070950	6072431	Alright, take care buddy.
6073251	6073872	Alright, later.
6073972	6074152	Later.
6075414	6081299	One more call, you guys, and we're getting hammered tonight, so if we don't get to your call, I'm really sorry, we're almost out of time.
6081799	6085822	We'll try to get more calls in a little later during the show, however, we're going to do one more.
6086383	6087724	Hello, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
6090306	6090626	Hi.
6090987	6091807	Hi, who's this?
6093028	6093769	This is Roz.
6093909	6095130	Hi, Roz, how are you?
6100294	6101575	That sounds a little iffy to me.
6102625	6105387	Yeah, I had an interesting weekend.
6105648	6106729	Okay, do tell.
6106769	6108210	What happened on your interesting weekend?
6109251	6115356	Okay, well, my dad has been in Mexico all week, and he just got back on Friday night.
6115676	6115997	Okay.
6116858	6123423	And as some of you may know, I was in a school play on Friday and Saturday evening.
6123804	6124064	Okay.
6125854	6129315	Well, he gets back Friday night after the play.
6129515	6130375	Missed the first night.
6130515	6132396	That's alright, after you beat the next night.
6134116	6137898	Uh, Saturday morning, I wake up.
6138358	6144860	I apparently had some kind of horrible allergic reaction to the makeup that they used on my face.
6145180	6146000	Oh no!
6147392	6151953	So I looked and felt sunburnt the whole day, and still do.
6152573	6159014	But that wasn't something that they found out before the play went, like you guys didn't do like a full-on dress rehearsal or anything, or?
6159934	6160114	No.
6162495	6166635	No, definitely, we didn't do a dress rehearsal, we just kind of went into it.
6166835	6168796	Oh no, okay.
6169096	6171976	So, yeah, I looked angry.
6174077	6176217	So did you end up doing the play on Saturday anyway?
6177768	6189714	Yeah, on Saturday, I left for the play, you know, went there, and the play actually went great, so that was good.
6189754	6195136	You know, my dad didn't go the second night because he was sick, and I didn't realize how sick he was.
6195156	6196157	Uh-oh.
6196957	6199379	Yeah, I'm going to say, I think he drank the water.
6201110	6202573	Oh no, in Mexico.
6203815	6212772	Yeah, so I was at the cast party, which was half-assed because there were only like four people at the party.
6213905	6219267	And we're talking, you know, we're talking about getting flowers from our parents, and I'm like, yeah, I didn't get any.
6220747	6227569	And my sister leads me off to the side, and she's like, here's why we didn't get you flowers.
6228469	6231410	Because we found Dad laying on the bathroom floor.
6233051	6238052	And... This is starting to sound more and more like an early FU of the week, in a way.
6238092	6241493	Like, this whole thing is just like, oh my gosh, I'd be so pissed.
6242799	6245020	Yeah, I was pretty pissed off about it.
6245920	6250341	I'm still pretty pissed off about it because he missed both nights because he was in Mexico.
6252361	6253122	Well, here you go.
6253542	6255062	You're in our chat room right now, right?
6256042	6256242	Yeah.
6256382	6257283	Okay, here's what I'm going to do.
6257303	6258663	I'm going to draw this on there.
6259123	6262704	I sent you a cyber flower there in the IRC room.
6263893	6264053	Aw.
6264433	6265114	So there you go.
6265174	6265754	We have you.
6267395	6267775	All right.
6267995	6269196	F you, PoePanda.
6270196	6270916	Shut the hell up.
6271197	6272957	I'm giving you the finger through my screen.
6273017	6274538	People are just mad because they didn't get through.
6274598	6275158	Don't listen to them.
6275519	6277559	We're going to take more calls later if we can.
6277620	6278420	People are just angsty.
6278740	6281501	Anyway, anything else you want to share, though, before we get on the next topic?
6288344	6289005	Good question.
6291877	6294499	I'm going to say probably not.
6294939	6295259	Alright.
6295399	6296780	Well, Roz, thanks so much for calling in.
6296820	6299262	I hope your week is better than your weekend was, okay?
6299722	6301624	Oh, and vote for my song on Cage Match.
6301884	6304586	Sakura said that she was using one of my songs.
6304886	6305306	Oh, really?
6305326	6306407	So vote for it, damn it.
6306627	6307087	Oh, really?
6307528	6307888	Alright.
6308068	6308928	Okay, well, we'll see.
6309049	6309689	We'll see how it goes.
6310249	6310570	Alright.
6311030	6311410	Take care.
6312031	6312311	Bye-bye.
6314268	6314649	All right.
6314709	6321555	Now, once again, we will open up the Skype line a little later, probably more towards the end of the show, because we want to bring DarkSakura back at some point as well.
6322375	6325618	But we're running behind on our other stuff and the stuff we've got to get to this week.
6326219	6332424	And, of course, you know it just wouldn't be a show if we didn't have ourselves a little bit of a cage match.
6335126	6335467	All right.
6336127	6336327	Now...
6337779	6341242	Since we weren't live last week, we didn't end up having a cage match last week.
6342303	6345685	So we have one that's actually a holdover from two weeks ago.
6345745	6348548	So technically it by default wins last week.
6348588	6350449	So it's going to be in its third week if it wins.
6351690	6353292	The song is by Depeche Mode.
6353792	6358476	And it's from their brand new album, which is called... I don't know what it's called.
6358496	6359397	I don't remember what it's called.
6359417	6360477	I think it's Playing the Angel.
6362479	6363360	The new Depeche Mode album.
6363380	6364361	I think it's called Playing the Angel.
6364401	6365301	Yes, it's called Playing the Angel.
6365842	6366963	The song is called Precious.
6367483	6368483	And it's our winner.
6369183	6373224	Remember the way the Cage Match works is that we play three songs for you guys.
6373244	6377426	We play a clip of the previous winner and two new songs in full for you guys.
6377706	6385688	You guys vote for your favorite in our chatroom at OrangeLoungeRadio.com and that winner goes into rotation all week long on Orange Lounge Radio's Video Game Music and More program.
6386088	6388348	Here it is, song number one tonight in the Cage Match.
6388408	6390269	A clip of Precious by Depeche Mode.
6392069	6395110	My God, what have we done to you?
6401218	6412221	We always tried to share The tenderest of care Now look what we have
6430826	6436128	There was a little left to give Angels with silver wings Should have no suffering
6460660	6462901	Thank you for watching!
6492518	6495705	I thought we'd vanish, but what left us
6509540	6513222	Okay, that was song number one in tonight's cage match, Depeche Mode with Precious.
6513242	6515243	Alright, we're going to get into song number two now.
6515283	6519725	This is actually DarkSakura's pick, and unfortunately she's unable to call us back right now and intro it herself.
6520105	6530571	But from what we understand, it sounds like Roz has something to do with this pick, so maybe she's doing that trick that I did last month when I had Miklatop pick one of my songs, and it went all the way to retirement.
6530931	6531571	So we'll see.
6531912	6533612	Will DarkSakura have the same luck?
6533652	6534113	We'll see.
6534453	6537615	Song number two is Tally Hall by Banana Man.
6538075	6538355	Enjoy.
6545504	6570861	Do you see Banana Man Hopping over on the white hot sand Here he come with some for me Freshly taken from Banana Tree Banana Man me want a ton Give me double and a bonus one Give me more for all me friends These banana flowin' never end
6578851	6580813	You want a banana?
6581834	6583817	This banana for you.
6584698	6587781	Tonight we dance around this flame.
6588622	6591505	Then we get to play the spirit game.
6591625	6594749	Spirit names we shout out loud.
6595249	6597952	Shake the thunder from the spirit cloud.
6598493	6599354	All this song burns.
6603736	6605778	Thank you for watching!
6629444	6653310	Look you, you're too uptight, you know You could laugh and kick it back and go But without a rhythm or a rhyme You do not banana all the time Fly away from city on the run Try to make a little fun Look you, come to the bungalow I've heard that you tell me don't you so Don't you love me bumping up the drum Make a shake until the bum go down Let the bum go play until you drop This banana never
6664838	6666319	Fungale, Fungalo, make up your mind
6699921	6715219	Well it's nine o'clock and it's getting dark and the sun is falling from the sky I've never left so early and you may wonder why
6729116	6730899	Thank you for watching!
6752198	6763983	No banana make you go insane Looking back to busy town No banana make you want to frown Do you want a banana?
6764003	6766504	Feel it now Do you want a banana?
6766524	6767425	This banana for...
6779068	6779229	You...
6805526	6810207	Song number two in tonight's cage match, Tally Howe with Banana Man.
6810247	6815168	Let's go around and see if that song is banana-rific or if it's just plain rotten.
6816129	6816249	Angel.
6816269	6818989	I don't know if it's the only one that started giggling when it started playing.
6819009	6819430	I was like, oh my god!
6819450	6820890	You're the only one that's seen the video, apparently.
6821130	6821630	Of course.
6821750	6822190	What'd you think?
6822670	6827812	Um... Yeah, it's kind of really great, you know, it's a music video.
6827872	6827992	Okay.
6828012	6828912	But, um...
6830149	6834752	I just don't think it's a 10 just because it's funny, but what the hell, I'll give it a 10.
6834892	6835493	Melody!
6859542	6862903	I, I, I just don't get it.
6863703	6867703	Okay, okay, I'll post the video in my live journal so everyone can get it.
6867923	6868844	Of course it doesn't!
6870104	6870684	For later!
6871784	6879365	I give it an F. Um, if Lince the Funny could say a thing, she would say, that banana was shit.
6880146	6881266	I give it a 1.
6883466	6888207	Loki, I'm sorry, but the cage match does not require video, so...
6888891	6892575	Based on the song alone, it sucked balls and it gets a 1.
6892615	6894237	Alright.
6895238	6898361	And DarkSakura is actually in chat right now.
6898401	6899122	She's yelling at me.
6899162	6900043	She gives it a score of 11T.
6900263	6902706	And it says, ba-na-na.
6903723	6906303	Unfortunately, 11T is not a number, therefore it's zero.
6907064	6907484	Stop.
6908944	6910424	Alright.
6911324	6911985	Moving on.
6912265	6914325	Song number three in tonight's cage match.
6914385	6916125	Loki, what the hell did you bring to the table today?
6916145	6921826	I don't even remember if I put this in the cage match or not, but this song sounds like a good song that would be for a guitar hero.
6922246	6923147	It's like a kick-ass song.
6923427	6929588	It features a guitarist by the name of John Sykes, who is also in Whitesnake and some other bands.
6930048	6930568	So, um...
6931277	6932779	This is actually a theme song to an anime.
6932959	6934962	White Snake sounds awesome to me.
6935062	6936043	So, it's badass.
6936284	6938126	John Sykes with Cautionary Warning.
6939107	6939307	Yes.
6939468	6939888	Here it is.
6939968	6940389	And short.
6940689	6941350	Enjoy, kids.
7078413	7079393	Thank you for watching!
7151178	7154679	Song number three is John Sykes with Cautionary Warning.
7154739	7157060	Let's go around and see what everybody thought of that one.
7157640	7157940	Angel.
7161861	7162342	It was good.
7162362	7165362	Eight and a half.
7166983	7168984	It was no Whitesnake, that's for damn sure.
7169104	7169444	Five.
7169984	7170364	Melody.
7171124	7173565	That was freaking cool and now I want to go play Guitar Hero.
7174325	7175386	Nine.
7176206	7176466	Mel.
7178855	7180736	DarkSakura says you get an automatic zero for being rude earlier.
7207315	7208416	Don't pick crappy songs then.
7209237	7210318	Oh snap.
7210578	7211158	Oh snap.
7212019	7214741	I gave her song a higher score than I gave your song.
7214761	7215983	That was not white.
7216023	7221327	You misrepresented that song by making me think it would be like White Snake.
7221667	7223009	I said he was in White Snake.
7223069	7224910	I didn't say he was like White Snake.
7224930	7225851	Misrepresent.
7225951	7227432	I demand a free trial.
7228153	7228433	Alright.
7229714	7232397	Let's recap the three songs you can vote for tonight, shall we?
7233592	7240994	Let's start off with song number one that you can vote for tonight is Depeche Mode with Precious.
7241074	7243314	If I can find it in my list here.
7244995	7248176	That worries me that I cannot suddenly find Depeche Mode with Precious.
7248196	7248696	Here we go.
7249376	7249836	Let's try this again.
7249856	7251536	Song number one was Precious by Depeche Mode.
7252377	7254537	Let's start with Depeche Mode.
7259163	7272279	Alright, song number two you can vote for tonight is Tally Hall with Banana Man And song number three you can vote for tonight is John Sykes with Cautionary Warning
7286209	7288750	Alright kids, place, vote now.
7288851	7294314	Send a private message to Sky with your vote for song number one, song number two, or, if you're so inclined, song number three.
7294694	7295274	It's your choice.
7295494	7296435	Send a vote in right now.
7296495	7297315	Private message, Sky.
7297375	7297655	Do it!
7299336	7299597	Alright.
7300377	7302658	Meanwhile, let's go over to Loki real quick.
7302878	7305360	What is going on in the sim scene, if I dare ask?
7305680	7306160	A few things.
7307181	7314245	The first being really cool, and that would be PSP Revolution, and it's basically kind of a port of Step Mania for the PSP.
7314972	7317093	and you can play your sim files on that.
7317454	7324198	The only thing it doesn't support right now is modifiers, so that's not in there, but at least it plays and it works, and it's pretty fun.
7324538	7327680	But, you know, best you can do with Controller Controller Revolution, so.
7329101	7332643	You can actually download that, we have a link on our website to where you can download that.
7333043	7337046	It's pretty awesome, it actually comes with a couple sim file packs in there, so you can check out some songs.
7338307	7341369	But yeah, so far, not bad for a first release, and...
7343360	7344501	That's pretty much about it.
7344781	7345742	All the important stuff, at least.
7366944	7371267	We like to sometimes watch a movie together and comment on it for you guys.
7371688	7382037	And the movie we're going to be commenting on this week is a news article that was recently, or actually not really an article, a news broadcast that was recently on our local television station.
7382077	7390445	It was WB58, and it was Loki and DarkSakura lending their expert opinions on Guitar Hero.
7390965	7392166	So let's check this out, shall we?
7392186	7393566	I'm going to bring up this video in studio.
7393806	7398969	But of course, for those of you guys out there in internet radio land, you guys will get to hear the audio of this.
7399369	7401330	And we will interject as need be with comments.
7403199	7403539	Thank you.
7403619	7404700	Well, a question I have for you.
7404740	7408822	Have you ever secretly dreamed of being a rock star, wailing on your electric guitar?
7409122	7410403	I dream of that every night.
7411803	7415465	Actually, there's nothing I love more than getting up on the bed and wailing like a rock star.
7415665	7416446	Sold out crowd.
7416926	7420968	Well, for most people, the closest they'll ever get to playing is an air guitar in their living room.
7421608	7424891	and a new video game called Guitar Hero just released today.
7424911	7426492	In other words, you can't afford this crap.
7427393	7430856	We're showing this to you because, you know, we're rich and famous.
7431016	7435019	It's designed to get wannabe rockers closer to the real stage experience.
7435619	7436600	Brian Hickey rocks on.
7436640	7438702	He asked the producers of the demo Guitar Hero.
7439505	7439685	Rock-On
7469805	7470986	The box office is sold out.
7495296	7500219	Your guitar is tuned, and you're about to play one of the greatest rock songs ever.
7517711	7521935	Just because I took time off in your work to come play this stupid game.
7523216	7523997	I thought you liked the game.
7524718	7525919	You give it a good score later.
7526319	7528361	Oh yeah, I give it a good score, but you know what?
7528381	7533886	I had to drive like a freaking half an hour during my lunch break to come play this game.
7535408	7535828	Whatever.
7539772	7542835	That's the idea behind Red Octane's new Guitar Hero.
7544184	7550766	What we say is rock music inspired this game, so having full-length songs is really important.
7550986	7556108	Game producer Jon Tam shows Jamie Devrend and Matt Whiteman, two avid gamers, how to play.
7556948	7559709	I didn't know how to play this before you showed me, dumbass.
7560169	7561549	I know, I know.
7561689	7563170	Strings, no chords to learn.
7563550	7570172	To create music, John presses colored fret buttons to match those on the screen while hitting the strum bar once for each note.
7570512	7571012	The goal?
7571452	7574253	Nail as many notes as you can to rack up the high score.
7574293	7575313	See, now that guy thought ahead.
7575353	7577293	He's wearing his Guitar Hero shirt on.
7577734	7578874	So, yeah, you're right.
7578894	7581775	We need to get Orange Lounge shirts for all these reasons, for all the media whoredom.
7582315	7584335	If I don't play anything, the guitar track doesn't play.
7584355	7590317	And if I hit this thing... Go figure that that would happen, that when you don't play anything, the guitar track won't play.
7590357	7591217	Go fig... I'm just...
7591604	7593165	I'm just giving this poor guy a hard time.
7593205	7597927	If you fuck up a lot, then you start doing the jig and then you walk off stage.
7598827	7600288	Look at these trashy noises.
7600748	7604309	Each guitar guru character has its own extroverted personality.
7604489	7609652	There's Pandora, Princess of Rock, and punk virtuoso Johnny Napalm, among others.
7609992	7612313	I love the remote, so I played I Wanna Be Sedated.
7614022	7615502	And I'm looking bored in the background.
7615562	7617523	Then she discovers the whammy bar.
7643416	7644577	The Whammy Bar, Whammy Bar!
7645978	7647879	And then she discovered my Whammy Bar.
7650320	7652001	I hate... The Whammy Bar is my favorite part.
7652282	7655624	I don't know why the hell I decided to be in these stupid news interviews.
7656224	7657105	They're really bad.
7657685	7662888	No, they're only bad when I bring them on the radio and start, you know, making fun of them.
7662948	7663529	It's embarrassing.
7663569	7665130	I tease because I love.
7665850	7667311	I tease because I love to make fun of you.
7667331	7668312	It does nothing for our station.
7670928	7674490	It's like gymnastics, you have to land that last note.
7674590	7678651	I love how Jamie's taking the guitar off as this guy's talking, like, get this fucking thing out of here.
7678711	7680032	No, I'm kidding.
7680072	7680372	Be gone.
7680752	7681352	This is funny.
7681912	7688955	To give you the experience of being on stage, this film takes you inside the different venues, from practice rooms and basements to sold-out stadiums.
7689215	7694217	And the fans react, jumping up and down when you rock the house or letting you know if you're playing stinks.
7694737	7697218	Extifer, wasn't this the same reporter you thought was cute?
7699258	7701239	Yeah, I still think he's cute.
7701339	7702960	Alright, slide that up.
7703180	7713064	You don't play well, they don't like you, they'll start leaving the venue and start booing you, and then eventually if you die, your whole band gives up and throws their hands up in frustration against you.
7715505	7723669	See, I don't understand that, because, you know, in the real world, Bailing keeps lasting on But Can They Sing, and yet... Never mind, nobody's gonna understand that joke.
7726084	7730026	Matt likes the fact that Guitar Hero offers different rock genres to explore.
7730126	7731767	By the way, that's my DDR pad in the background.
7732068	7733848	That's my cameo in the story.
7734629	7737710	That's my dance pad lying there unloved in the background.
7739151	7741553	I don't even know why my dance pad's there.
7741733	7743333	Red Octane?
7743494	7745174	Oh yeah, it's the old Red Octane pad though.
7745254	7748856	From classic rock and hard rock to modern, punk even blues.
7749477	7749957	Fun game.
7750515	7751195	Really fun game.
7751516	7758559	To kick his song into high gear, Matt tilts the guitar up, activating star power, which allows him to rack up even more points.
7759099	7760040	Really good party game.
7760120	7764822	I mean, especially, you know, get a bunch of friends together, just, you know, don't say it, smash up some music.
7764842	7766002	Don't say it, don't say it.
7766082	7766543	Really fun.
7766903	7769444	So how do these two gamers rate Guitar Hero?
7769744	7771565	I'd definitely say it's at least an 8 out of a 10.
7772185	7772666	And Jamie?
7772786	7776968	Now see, I could clip that and use that for some great... I'd definitely say it's at least an 8 out of 10.
7778868	7781731	So, Loki, how big is Skye's penis?
7782091	7784133	I'd definitely say it's at least an 8 out of 10.
7787075	7788517	There's so much I could do with this.
7789978	7790618	Oh, 11.
7792360	7795763	What's with Jamie and the 11s lately?
7795943	7797424	They said a scale of 1 to 10.
7797685	7801328	I was basically giving a ranking within the criteria that they asked.
7801608	7803510	And she had to go out of the criteria.
7803530	7804170	I don't know.
7804351	7805572	It was an 11 game for me.
7805652	7805952	Whatever.
7806829	7807449	I like the game.
7807469	7807849	I like the game.
7807909	7808349	It's cool.
7808369	7810050	It's just completely rocking out.
7810590	7812751	It feels like playing an actual guitar.
7813491	7816311	Yeah, they let her talk and they paraphrase me.
7818432	7820552	Brian Hickey, WB58 News at 10.
7822613	7826414	Well, maybe what she's saying is more intelligent as opposed to, it's so fun.
7827794	7831315	Oh, man, I just got the death stare.
7831535	7833316	This, by the way, will be the last episode on this video.
7836441	7839784	Anyway, let's see what the two goons on the TV have to say about this.
7840125	7841486	You've got to love playing that air guitar.
7841506	7843188	I would like to have that mohawk going on.
7843588	7845430	Well, Guitar Hero is designed to be played on PlayStation.
7845450	7846951	By the way, he was talking about his pubic hair right there.
7846971	7848192	I'd like to have that mohawk going on.
7848472	7849453	Two, and it cost about $70.
7849533	7850734	Stay with us.
7850775	7851856	More to come right after the break.
7855219	7862045	They did also, I want to add, they also did a story apparently about In The Groove and how people are losing weight on it.
7864249	7867066	To which I could basically go, so you're recycling news now?
7870722	7872262	I didn't see the In The Groove story.
7872282	7873803	Yeah, we weren't part of it, thank God.
7873963	7875663	So I didn't bother to tape it.
7875743	7877423	I would have laughed if they wanted me to play this game.
7877663	7878764	So what do you give In The Groove?
7878884	7888465	Well, in the original email, I thought that that was, because that's why I hyped it up like I did, is that you're never going to believe what Loki and DarkSakura are going to be doing on the news.
7888746	7893866	Because originally it was supposed to be for In The Groove and Guitar Hero, but I guess something got fixed.
7893907	7895827	Yeah, I would have been cut off TV for that.
7895967	7896127	Yeah.
7897034	7898556	Alright, anyway, we're going to go to another break.
7898896	7903460	One more break here of Ultramix 3 Music, and then we're going to come back and we're going to reveal the winner of tonight's cage match.
7904161	7908506	We will also get into the FUs of the week and do Extover's movie review.
7908566	7909226	We can't forget that.
7909647	7918796	So don't send your FUs just yet, though, because I haven't tallied cage match votes, but this is the last opportunity for you guys to get your stuff into the cage match and everything you want to vote for there.
7919216	7925963	Alright, we're going to go into this break, and in this break I think we're going to start it off with a brand new Naoki track from DDR Ultramix 3.
7926304	7928666	This is Naoki with Brilliant Red.
7931269	7931590	Naoki
7965752	7974461	Yes, that you were so much more It's just the way that you move your body with mine Seems like we had no concept
7995010	7996251	Thank you for watching!
8048777	8050778	Watch away what I know, it's an overrated
8083966	8085048	Thank you for watching!
8088740	8114221	When you speak, when you shout, when you shout out, when you knock myself out, brainwashed I need a brainwash, cream that'll pass, I need to clutter off, thrown in the trash I need a brainwash, cause I'm a moon, cause I'm a psycho, devil's race I'm really gonna miss a maniac, I'm gonna find a way to put me in a room But there's a nickel pin that gives me 14, cause all I wanna do is sing to a national song But I like to sing in minor technology
8116078	8116719	Thanks for watching!
8141269	8148232	And now I fell in love with you so many times, so many times
8171653	8173758	Thank you for watching!
8272143	8273294	Your direction
8308130	8309581	Your direction
8330166	8333329	After this song, we'll be having a Let Them Move Marathon.
8333649	8335711	No!
8335911	8336552	Just kidding.
8336992	8338033	Orange Lounge Radio.
8338093	8339695	Crap-free Bobani Radio.
8340015	8341937	Welcome back, boys and girls, to Orange Lounge Radio.
8342818	8346281	I bet you kids are just dying to know who won tonight's cage match, aren't ya?
8346681	8347762	You're just dying to know.
8347782	8349204	You just want to know so badly.
8349584	8350044	Here it is.
8350225	8352587	The wiener of tonight's cage match tonight is...
8354369	8357412	John Sykes with Cautionary Warning.
8358894	8363599	Shoot, all of you.
8363659	8364199	Rock on.
8364640	8366862	By the way, check the LiveJournal community.
8367523	8375751	Dude, it took Socarina like five minutes to turn that into, just like I imagined, into a little picture with the guy doing the rock on song.
8376229	8378770	We could send a picture of us doing the rock on symbol from that.
8379071	8382332	We could send it to him, and he'd be all, he'd be all, what the fuck is this?
8382352	8384273	Because he wouldn't remember doing that, I mean.
8385474	8388155	It's your fan club, Mr. News Person.
8390697	8391317	Oh, shit.
8391377	8391697	All right.
8394559	8404064	All right, we're going to get into the FUs of the week, and first, in order for us to get into the FUs of the week, I have to have the music queued up, because that's an important part of having the FUs of the week.
8405385	8405765	Oh, you have a new...
8406505	8407145	Oh, that's right.
8408166	8409326	Loki has a new song finally.
8409647	8411027	You're getting rid of Monomena?
8415729	8416810	That makes me kind of sad.
8417230	8421752	That's right, I'll let Mel and Melody have Monomena then, since you're not going to be using it.
8422233	8426154	You were showing me your video iPod, which I'm so jealous that you have all the latest toys, but would you do this?
8427335	8431037	So I go and get a video iPod, and I'm like, oh my god, I have the new toy, I love this thing.
8431077	8432838	So what's the first freaking video I put on it?
8432938	8433338	Monomena.
8440291	8443736	Let's get into the FUs of the week, and DarkSakura is usually the one that starts us off.
8443776	8446521	However, I will be entering FUs on DarkSakura's behalf tonight.
8446581	8448284	So here we go in the FUs of the week.
8459172	8461634	DarkSakura, I'll be entering some FUs on DarkSakura's behalf.
8463055	8470700	First FU is to being sick, because I know she's been sick for like two weeks straight now, and also to bronchitis, which she has, which sucks.
8471241	8475163	And FU to pneumonia for scaring her, you know, thinking that she might have had pneumonia.
8475744	8483089	And I think she's very angsty that she didn't get out to do a lot of stuff this weekend that she wanted to do, so I'm sure she's very pissed off about that.
8483129	8485570	So an FU to being homebound, I guess we could call it.
8486071	8487712	And an FU to having to go to work tomorrow.
8489813	8496095	And I think that would about wrap up everything that DarkSakura would be ATS, at least as far as I know, for now.
8496155	8498376	Let's go into Loki's FUs.
8499157	8499317	Okay.
8509366	8515487	First off, fuck you to Chevron Oil Stop for breaking my car.
8516347	8520688	Now my car is leaking coolant out, and I'm sure it's not supposed to be doing that.
8521148	8525049	Because I pour the coolant in, and it pours right out the bottom, so that's not very good.
8525389	8530911	However, it doesn't empty, so it just overheats, and I've got to take it to the dealership tomorrow, which requires me to take time off work.
8531731	8533171	It's just a pain in the ass.
8533786	8561745	so fuck that, and fuck you old Asian women drivers, because god damn it, you fucking suck, I'm sitting in the car watching you drive, and you suck so bad, you know, braking when there's like a car 50 feet in front of you, and like having your turn signal on, and switching lanes the wrong direction, and it's just a pain in the ass, and you just really, you know, are reinforcing the stereotypes, so fuck old Asian women drivers, and finally Rocko,
8563737	8564197	My turn.
8569178	8577120	I would like to give an F you to me being a workaholic recently and me being very lazy on the weekend and not having any time to correct the test because I'm too lazy.
8577820	8589902	An F you to the fact that it took me like an hour to get that set up earlier tonight to rip the Ultramix 3 songs directly from the Xbox and no one appreciates it because the song list is kind of whack.
8591629	8599278	and I just give, I don't know, an F you to the fact that I have to go back to work tomorrow but at least it's a short week and Thanksgiving's coming.
8599658	8601961	F you to Thanksgiving because it's a holiday I never really got.
8602141	8606266	I don't get Thanksgiving but maybe it's just my family because we're special in my family.
8606286	8607767	We don't really do that.
8607807	8609269	You should really call it for what it is.
8609389	8610591	Black Friday Eve.
8612683	8613905	Oh, for the shopping day, yeah.
8614385	8614746	Crazy.
8615347	8618911	Alright, let's go on to Melody.
8618991	8620353	We're going to do her FUs first.
8620573	8620753	Yay!
8620773	8623897	I like my freaking theme song.
8628993	8637920	Okay, seriously, at work, there's this chick who knows the song and loves my video iPod as much as I do, and we'll yell across the office to each other, and the other one will reply.
8637960	8638320	It's great.
8638700	8649369	Anyway, F you to curbs, because they really hurt when you fall on them, and F you to my knee for hurting when I hit the curb.
8650890	8654052	F you to my shoes, which went out sooner than they were supposed to.
8654072	8656574	Dude, my shoes are supposed to last like 300 to 500 miles.
8656614	8657174	They only lasted 200.
8658266	8679996	which all my FUs seem to be walk related at the moment because that would be my life but um yeah oh FU to Sunday Drivers they had to encounter a lot of them today coming up here and they suck so other than that I'm pretty mellow right now so yeah I'm pretty simple all right Mr. Mel B
8683030	8691575	Oh gosh, um, I guess my first FU is to all the video game stores and Best Buys in my area, because Guitar Hero is sold out everywhere.
8691855	8696757	What really sucks is that the one Best Buy by my crib, I was asking the sales associate, you know, do you have this in stock?
8697258	8698478	And he goes, oh, we don't have it right now.
8698498	8700079	I'm like, can you check anyone's nearby?
8700099	8700980	He's like, okay.
8701400	8705582	And then there's like one that pops up over in South San Jose, it says like two on his screen.
8705896	8707177	He goes, uh, we're sold out ever.
8707197	8708958	I'm like, what about that San Jose over there?
8709178	8710379	Uh, two means we're sold out.
8710979	8712280	Like, then why is there a two?
8713201	8716423	Um, you can go there, I guess, but no, trust me, it's sold out.
8716763	8719925	I'm like, dude, I guess you don't like helping people or making a sale.
8720626	8724348	Uh, whatever the hell, you know, I hope you're just happy with the minimum wage or something.
8724889	8732213	But, um, other than that, um, I guess just Defeat and I have enough time to do so much stuff over the weekend, and, uh...
8733594	8737159	Yeah, FU for not having enough FUs to be entertaining.
8737559	8737899	Alright.
8738660	8740282	Alright, Angel, your FUs of the week.
8741063	8745709	I actually don't have any, but... Nothing?
8746948	8748329	Aw, no more ball pits!
8749310	8751411	Pair drop!
8751772	8753193	It's okay.
8754513	8759797	Well, I guess I could say a general F you, but then... Out with it!
8759997	8760357	Out with it!
8760838	8762119	Mel B might look at me funny.
8763379	8768423	They need more games to help people with visual impairment, isn't it?
8769824	8771485	So, um, yeah.
8771665	8775327	Cause, um, if it wasn't for certain World of Warcraft mods, I'd be in big trouble.
8776028	8776928	So, yeah.
8777529	8781592	At least World of Warcraft is moddable enough to be able to do something like that.
8782292	8786595	But, I beat all the other people that don't think about that before they release a game.
8787936	8788616	Fair enough.
8788636	8792719	Well, at least the computer has it down pretty good with the accessibility options and everything.
8792759	8793039	Yes.
8794160	8795761	This is why I'm a computer geek.
8795861	8797002	I can see things.
8797402	8797802	Yay.
8799321	8807927	Alright, now it's my understanding that DarkSakura was actually at her computer just now, and she wanted to try and call in and get the real FUs, so I'm gonna try and get her on the line here.
8809348	8814912	Let's make this really quiet here, let's see if we can get DarkSakura's FUs, and then we'll go to the chatroom FUs, of which I know you guys have plenty of FUs.
8820877	8823899	It's got that demon voice again, ah!
8824759	8825380	What, you there, Jamie?
8828410	8828730	Hello?
8829531	8832152	There we go, yes, now we're good.
8832772	8834073	Alright, great, yes, I can hear you now.
8834333	8835413	Are you ready to do your FUs?
8839075	8844898	That's weird, I only heard her for like five seconds there, something like, what's wrong?
8845438	8847599	Uh, you're, oh, shoot, did it just hang up?
8849730	8850371	It hung up!
8850531	8851251	No, no!
8851371	8852532	Okay, wait, she's calling us back.
8852652	8854454	Let me make sure all my other crap is closed.
8854474	8855174	I have nothing else going on.
8855214	8855915	Okay, let's try this again.
8856535	8858757	Let me try closing iTunes, because iTunes is a real memory hog.
8858817	8859557	That might be part of the problem.
8859577	8860058	Alright, here we go.
8861038	8861419	Yes?
8862800	8863300	Excuse me.
8863480	8864661	There we go, now you're there.
8865462	8867143	It's because I disconnected IRC.
8867263	8869444	It's a delay that IRC is causing.
8870225	8870826	Interesting.
8870846	8872106	Okay, well, are you ready to do your FUs?
8872146	8873107	I have your music already.
8873808	8874808	Yeah, I'm pretty ready.
8874909	8875349	Alright, here we go.
8879631	8881652	I'm turning it down now.
8881672	8882032	There we go.
8882593	8883133	There we go.
8884033	8888015	My first SU goes toward having a pissed off and depressed husband.
8889916	8895919	My second SU goes to people who are pissed off at everyone who's able to get an Xbox 360 on launch date.
8896279	8899801	Just because you can't get one, bitch, don't mean you should be down with everybody else.
8900101	8900542	Hello?
8904744	8909026	The third one goes toward my pre-pneumonia.
8910675	8916400	and the fact that my antibiotics are just now starting to make me feel sicker.
8917721	8921584	And I can't really think of much of anything else.
8921644	8924146	Those are the major pressing items on my mind.
8925707	8926167	Alrighty.
8926327	8928389	Well, I'm glad we could get you back on for the FUs.
8928469	8932192	After all, it is your baby here on the program, the angst, so...
8933046	8934987	Of course, it's not FU's about me.
8935227	8938308	Alright, well, we're gonna let you go for now though, so we can get to chatroom FU's, okay?
8938829	8939169	Okay!
8939349	8939849	Alright, take care.
8940629	8940870	Bye.
8941050	8941290	Bye.
8942010	8945472	Okay, uh, let's get into chatroom FU's.
8945512	8947233	And god damn, there's a lot of you angst.
8947273	8949113	Look at all, look, every single one of these blinking.
8949534	8951555	Every single one of those things blinking right now is an FU, so.
8954016	8954756	Get a cup of cocoa.
8954776	8956757	This is gonna be like an Ultramix 3 loading screen.
8959810	8964694	Sakurina says F you to Konami for not having In My Dreams in any games other than Dance Maniac's first mix.
8964734	8968998	It's the best Dance Maniac song ever and you guys can't even bother putting it in anything but Dance Maniacs?
8969038	8969458	Fuck you!
8970119	8974242	Also F you to the stupid teacher who made me fail his class because he made an error and still won't correct it.
8974703	8978946	F you to the smoker bitch at the bus stop who never stops blowing her goddamn cigarette smoke my way.
8979286	8982629	And final F you, F you to the Xbox 360 for being an overrated piece of shit.
8982909	8985271	Thanks Microsoft for making a sucky demo kiosk.
8985872	8986733	That was from Sakurina.
8987816	8994819	Dark Knight would like to say, um, F you to having to get up at 5am to catch a bus to get to work now, and F you to being broke again.
8997900	9004583	Um, NintendoManiac64 says, F you to you guys not noticing that someone was playing Mario Kart DS about an hour ago.
9004963	9008724	No, I knew Loki's been playing Mario Kart DS all night, but I thought, I didn't think the mic was picking it up.
9009285	9012086	Uh, F you to you guys for not sharing your MKDS friend codes.
9012386	9014747	I'll give it out, just send me a private message on Orange Lounge.
9014807	9017508	I just don't want, like, the freaky other people on the internet to, to
9017819	9018439	DarkLionXVI says,
9042441	9046103	F you to Colin Cowherd of ESPN Radio for dissing the late Eddie Guerrero.
9046163	9046984	Oh, I heard about this.
9047444	9051006	You might have no interest in professional wrestling, but dissing the dead is unforgivable.
9051126	9053287	I hope you die and see what it's like to be dissed dead.
9053988	9054768	You know what?
9054988	9064253	I don't follow wrestling, so I didn't... But that's why I don't say anything about it, because I don't follow it, so I just, you know... Well, if it's any consolation, I'm 100% behind that F you.
9064293	9066835	Yeah, I understand it's a big deal, you know.
9067435	9069156	Don't fuck with wrestling fans, man.
9069176	9069736	There's some...
9070777	9072178	They will throw you to the mat.
9072218	9078482	Dude, one of the pro wrestling sites put up the ESPN comment line and email address and the wrestling fans crashed both.
9078622	9079763	Oh, I can imagine.
9079783	9084846	Ah, we don't do personal FUs.
9085366	9087888	FU to some people telling me to stop correcting at things.
9088669	9092231	Hey, they might be something little to you, but that's a big thing to me.
9094059	9099504	SSJ100 Matt says, F you to work screwing me over this week and making me miss my first Thanksgiving away from home.
9099984	9104288	F you to True Crimes New York City for being such a good game but glitchy and choppy as hell.
9107090	9112054	Popanda says, F you to my gimpy father for preventing me from getting Indian food.
9114616	9115277	Too spicy?
9116018	9116318	I don't know.
9117299	9122343	Illusion says, F you to being sick for two weeks straight and F you to having two, count them, two papers due this week.
9123630	9129934	MPQ says, F you to being completely unprepared for my Japanese test tomorrow, and F you to the Ultra K tarnishing the new arcade with 2DX.
9130374	9133256	I think there was something else, but I forget, so F you to my shit memory.
9134396	9139299	Neo14789 says, F you to the creative Xbox 360 distribution strategy.
9139439	9140020	It sucks!
9141541	9144623	Xander C would like to say, F you to being on the East Coast.
9144683	9146644	It's too damn late right now, like midnight.
9147824	9148905	Sorry, that's our bad.
9149425	9150406	Damn us being on the West Coast.
9151880	9154026	Misty says, F you to having to work Friday.
9154387	9156714	Nuff said and I don't care that I'm off for Thanksgiving itself.
9156794	9158038	And of course, fuck cage match.
9158218	9159061	Well, love you too, babe.
9159949	9165132	Dark Knight says, F you to my PC, telling me I have to reinstall Windows because one file went mysteriously missing.
9165772	9172176	Legend of Zaku says, F you to MTV for being unprepared assholes who have no gaming taste, but at least they gave me two $50 games.
9172436	9174457	Thanks MTV for pipping my checking account.
9174857	9182001	F you to GameStop for having the gall of offering me $14 for my sealed copy of NBA Live 06, and 20% less of that if I wanted cash for it.
9183140	9186002	Roz would like to say F you to whatever my dad's deal was last night.
9186142	9189204	F you to the basketball team for constantly bitching about the people in the school play.
9189524	9191625	It's not our fault that the directors were bitches to you.
9192145	9194306	F you to my sensitive skin for being sensitive.
9197068	9200150	And BXJasonXB says F you to fanboys.
9200290	9201270	Brilliant Red sucks.
9201350	9202211	It's not a good song.
9202251	9205253	Go listen to B-Rock U. I have to agree.
9205293	9206033	Brilliant Red sucks.
9206193	9208995	So you have at least my support in that, BXJasonXB.
9210316	9216059	StepperRoss1215 says, F you to the Ultramix 3 problems and to the 360 hype, even though I'm still getting one at launch.
9216139	9218160	Hey, I'm an equal opportunist gamer.
9218621	9221922	And F you to the random Garth Brooks concert during the MTV taping.
9223963	9230067	That's like that time Loki and I tried to go to Hooters and there was a very random Audioslave concert in the middle of the street.
9231648	9233249	How many times does that happen to you?
9233329	9237571	That you have this just a random, oh hey look, Audioslave's doing a concert in the middle of the street.
9238075	9241778	In New York, they had U2 show up and do a concert on a flatbed truck.
9241798	9243519	That's how they did their All Because of You video.
9244039	9247701	And you see a bunch of people taking pictures with their cell phones and stuff.
9247721	9248942	They're all like, what the hell is U2?
9249963	9250323	All right.
9251764	9254526	Let's go ahead and get to another quick break.
9254706	9256087	You guys are going to be leaving now, right?
9256227	9256487	Yeah.
9256507	9256627	I know.
9256647	9257588	You've got a long drive back.
9257608	9259249	Thank you for coming to the show, though, and hanging with us.
9259269	9259849	We appreciate it.
9260270	9261030	Yeah.
9261090	9261651	You guys are cool.
9261671	9262051	We like you.
9262911	9263792	We like you, too.
9263972	9264973	Final thoughts, kids?
9265013	9265053	Aw.
9266826	9268107	Melody?
9268347	9269648	I have to take time to think.
9271590	9272510	Well, gosh, man.
9272630	9273051	Ultramix 3.
9273431	9277834	Well, let's just hope Ultramix 4 about does this last bit.
9278435	9285500	Alright, that Guitar Hero rocks, and hopefully I'll come back next time with more goodies for the show.
9285768	9288509	I'd like to thank you very much for the Guitar Hero poster for the studio.
9288529	9289029	Appreciate it.
9289450	9289690	Awesome.
9290030	9294372	And then I can't say what the other thing is because it's a birthday present for somebody, but thanks for that too, for hooking up.
9294492	9300634	Okay, and I think, like I said, like I mentioned before, I'll have one for the, maybe for the masses if they're nice.
9301154	9301454	Awesome.
9302095	9302435	Awesome.
9302735	9303995	And Melody, of course, thanks to you too.
9304055	9310478	And once again, Melody's Drive fundraiser, she's going to be running a 26... Walking.
9310638	9311539	Walking a 26-mile...
9312881	9313581	Marathon for this.
9314382	9318443	www.livejournal.com slash users slash Melathon.
9319083	9322684	Yeah, I'll put it in the LiveJournal community tonight and yeah, rock on.
9323525	9324005	Rock on.
9324025	9324525	Rock on.
9324565	9325085	Rock on.
9325425	9325805	Peace.
9326246	9327526	Peace, you cool cats.
9329427	9334508	We had some requests, so I'm going to get to those requests because I'm a nice guy and I'm doing the requests.
9334548	9342451	So we're going to do just a couple of requests, then we're going to come back and yes, I will open up the Skype line one more time because some of you guys are bitching and moaning that you didn't get through
9342779	9344483	So we'll give you one more chance.
9344924	9346086	So we'll be back after this.
9346487	9350415	Started off with that Forsaid Dance Maniacs song in some of these FUs.
9350495	9350856	We'll be back.
9648409	9659704	For up to the minute Vamanian gaming news, discussion forums, and for access to the chat room, visit our website at orangeloungeradio.com.
9664156	9670505	Alright kids, so we're back here on Orange Lingerie, and as promised we will be opening the Skype line soon, but we have a couple things we need to get to first.
9671526	9681600	One of them being the one and only Extifer is here, and Extifer, you do your own show on this station, believe it or not, I don't know why we gave you a show, but you do have one, and when is it?
9682279	9683340	It's on Mondays.
9683800	9686522	It's on Mondays at 7 o'clock to 9.
9687763	9688883	Pretty random show.
9689243	9696268	We don't talk about video games all too much, but I pretty much open the show to talk about anything.
9697088	9699490	Mostly cock, ass, and fucking.
9699710	9701773	So it's like The View, but with a bunch of perverts.
9701953	9704557	Oh yeah, and I try to have guests on the show.
9705198	9710445	Last week, by the way, I gave everybody an assignment that nobody has emailed me over.
9710465	9711266	What is the assignment?
9711286	9715753	The assignment was to watch a sad movie and email me your thoughts on it.
9716865	9717526	Oh, and nobody's done it.
9717546	9720369	I told the whole chat room to do it, and they have not done it.
9720549	9721910	Well, then you better hurry up.
9722491	9725594	I'm going to beat all of your asses tomorrow on my show if you guys don't do that.
9726535	9727356	All right.
9727416	9729338	Public spanking from Esther.
9729398	9731400	Tuesday nights on this very station.
9731720	9733341	She's only every other week for right now.
9733442	9737545	I'm not sure if she's on or off this week because of her being sick.
9737606	9739968	I think it's an on week, but because she's sick, she might be off.
9740688	9744249	I don't know, but check out, pump up the volume with the one and only DarkSakura.
9744269	9746510	And of course, that's 7 o'clock Pacific Time.
9746990	9757234	And of course, if you want to always be in the know on when we're live and stuff, the best place to be is our LiveJournal community, www.livejournal.com slash users slash Orange Lounge.
9757714	9759055	I wonder if you know what it's about.
9759075	9759135	Hey!
9789414	9791216	Mr. Wonderful, what are you going to be reviewing today?
9791997	9793979	Oh, that's right, you're a big Harry Potter whore, aren't you?
9794199	9795640	I am a big Harry Potter whore.
9795660	9797522	So were you in line with all the 13-year-old girls?
9797602	9798063	I wasn't.
9799636	9806597	I just have to say that I had to work on Friday, so I didn't get to see it until Friday after work, after 5 o'clock.
9808178	9817139	We had tried to go to an earlier showing, but all the showings were sold out, so we had to go see the last showing, which was at 11.05.
9817239	9819480	Didn't the movie make like $11 billion this weekend?
9819760	9825901	You know, it's interesting because their expectations for this film were that it was going to make less,
9826696	9827036	and so on.
9853556	9862384	Of the four movies that are the best openings ever, Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire is the only one that is a winner movie.
9863225	9871793	All the other ones are summer films, like Spider-Man, and then there was a couple other ones, Return of the Sith or whatever.
9871934	9873735	Anyways, yeah, I'm not a Star Wars fan.
9873775	9875337	Anyways, so I...
9876801	9880924	I saw the movie and it is really good.
9881104	9881785	I enjoyed it.
9884126	9889250	It fucking annoyed me at the beginning because, and it was weird because
9890356	9894657	The third one didn't annoy me at all for what they left out in the book.
9894757	9895738	I loved the film.
9895798	9897938	It was great the whole way through.
9898278	9899499	I saw it seven times.
9899959	9900999	I saw it in London.
9901859	9907221	It was something that was kind of like a magical experience for Christopher.
9908141	9910742	But this one kind of bugged me.
9910802	9912462	I kept on comparing it to the book.
9912823	9917124	I think it's because they left out so much and I was wanting to...
9918044	9919746	Thank you for watching, and I'll see you next time!
9929338	9930439	It's like so good.
9930599	9932080	It gets really good near the end.
9932501	9933922	And they do a lot of good stuff.
9934362	9936885	And it is dark, and it did earn its PG-13 rating.
9937365	9950516	Whether it was for the gratuitous sexual innuendos or the, you know, dark themes throughout the film, I don't know what it was, you know, why it was rated PG-13.
9950857	9952899	But it was rated PG-13 for a reason.
9953658	9954959	And it was really good.
9955039	9955860	I recommend it.
9955960	9970053	It's just that they rushed through the first half of the film so much that you're kind of feeling like you're ADD, like you can't focus on one particular scene, you know, because they take so much... It's like they wanted to put as much as they could from the book, but they just couldn't because of time constraints.
9971794	9972235	It was good.
9972835	9973335	I enjoyed it.
9973656	9974857	I enjoyed it mucho.
9974997	9975717	Recommend it.
9976958	9977879	So, thumbs up?
9978440	9979941	Thumbs up.
9980041	9982063	I didn't love it, but I liked it a lot.
9983824	9987407	And I can't wait for the next one, because that was my favorite book.
9987988	9989068	Alright.
9989088	9991190	We'll see what happens.
9991230	9993912	Moving on now, what we're going to do is we are...
9996940	10001781	Gonna go ahead and give DarkSakura another call because she's not able to be here in person tonight.
10003001	10006262	But she does want to talk to us all through the Skype line and let us know how she's enjoying the show.
10008062	10009602	And then we'll open the Skype line to the rest of you.
10010042	10010862	Because I promise we would.
10011763	10014363	We might have time to squeeze one more call in before the show's over.
10015843	10016423	Hello?
10016623	10017043	Hello!
10027878	10028298	Jamie?
10031440	10033082	Well, it didn't have the... She didn't hang up on you?
10033242	10033902	No, she didn't hang up.
10034062	10034503	Oh, there we are.
10034663	10035043	Hello?
10037205	10037785	Can you hear me?
10038265	10039666	Yeah, we can kind of hear you.
10041367	10044970	I had to turn off the... That's weird.
10045210	10046971	Call us right back.
10047091	10047692	I hope she heard that.
10047732	10048612	Call us right back.
10049213	10050073	I hope she got that part.
10050614	10052435	Because it seems like it works better when she calls us.
10052715	10053616	I don't know if it's just me.
10053656	10056418	It's like she's not Dark Sakura, she's Dark Sock.
10058066	10058466	Hello!
10061047	10061727	Coffee cough.
10061747	10063127	Well, at least we know we can hear her this time.
10063167	10064267	I know, doesn't she sound so sick?
10064447	10065328	How are you, Jamie?
10066508	10067008	Nah!
10067908	10068929	Are you enjoying the show?
10070009	10070609	Sort of.
10070829	10072189	Yeah?
10072309	10076050	It's better when I'm there, because it's, you know... I know.
10076110	10079471	Mel and Melody say hello, of course, and, you know, hope you feel better and stuff.
10081030	10082830	Oh, I'm not running a fever anymore.
10083350	10084011	That's good.
10084911	10085891	They brought you a present.
10086871	10086991	Oh?
10087251	10091272	I can't say what it is because it's something I got someone else for their birthday who might be listening.
10091432	10093713	So, it's something.
10093893	10094993	I'll send you a private message.
10095893	10096393	Okay.
10096573	10096833	Okay.
10098374	10100474	We've got ten minutes left on the show.
10100774	10101074	I know.
10101534	10102454	Aw, sweetie, feel better.
10103695	10106395	Well, is there anything else you wanted to say to the listeners?
10106455	10108056	Give them a final thought of some sort?
10109876	10109976	Um...
10111520	10112540	I like burritos.
10112940	10113841	I ate one today.
10114501	10115681	Congratulations.
10116442	10117982	I don't like lung cookies.
10118462	10120403	I feel like my cat.
10120643	10122163	Don't burritos make you fart, though?
10123304	10124584	No, they make me throw up.
10124684	10126124	That's the problem I have with burritos.
10126205	10127705	They make me fart like a whole bunch.
10127865	10129125	That is new information.
10129145	10129546	Thank you for that.
10129566	10131086	I know what my cat feels like, though.
10132466	10133607	Oh, go ahead.
10133627	10136548	Because horking up lung cookies is like horking up air balls.
10138647	10139387	I saw Adam Curry's hair.
10139407	10140368	He was stood a foot away from me.
10140388	10140948	He's still hot.
10167887	10170869	And he's like put on muscle or something.
10170929	10172510	He looks like really good shape.
10172690	10173590	Maybe he's been working out.
10174270	10174711	Maybe.
10175311	10182955	But I think now that he's a little older, he actually looks more handsome than he did back in his, you know, glam-looking 80s days.
10185396	10186437	Did you get to get up on stage?
10188898	10192160	No, they didn't let us say anything, so Julie and I just leeched off the buffet.
10193080	10194001	Hey, awesome food!
10195006	10198607	It was actually really good food, but the thing is that they didn't want to let us in because we didn't have badges.
10198627	10200228	We were like, hey, we won a prize.
10200848	10201868	Like, okay, you can come in.
10202909	10204769	Was Adam Curry wearing leather?
10205790	10211652	No, he was wearing like, like a tux, except he didn't have the jacket or the tie in.
10211692	10212952	It was sort of unbuttoned at the top.
10213192	10216293	It was that very casual, dressy look.
10216413	10218134	What a lazy, lazy bat.
10218174	10218634	No, I'm kidding.
10219795	10223816	Hey, there were people who were dressed in, you know, like, like,
10224435	10230379	Nice clothes and then people who were sort of not so nice.
10231580	10237084	Like people who were wearing like what you wear to like go work out in or something.
10237384	10241007	Now, you know, if I had gone, I would have dressed fabulously if I had went.
10241207	10242308	I dressed fabulously.
10242328	10242768	What did you wear?
10242788	10243949	I forgot to put on my boots.
10244730	10246151	Did you wear your angel wings?
10246971	10247612	No, I didn't.
10247832	10249273	You forgot to put on your boots.
10249833	10252035	You know those really hot pants I have?
10252555	10253016	I'm sorry, what?
10253644	10253904	Yeah, I did.
10253924	10254044	I met...
10284271	10290435	Frank from The Overnightscape, a really cool independent talk show podcast.
10293297	10297880	I met a few other people from the general New Jersey area, pretty cool folks.
10299081	10300141	We hung out there for a while.
10300182	10304945	I actually got interviewed for his podcast as one of the winners.
10305325	10307506	I wonder if that's aired yet.
10307546	10308327	We'll have to check that out.
10308919	10310821	Probably, he does his nightly.
10311102	10312764	Oh my god, that's a lot.
10313444	10314806	Yeah, that's a bit much.
10315547	10315827	I know.
10316168	10318130	Could you imagine if we tried to do OLR nightly?
10318170	10318851	Oh my god, we'd die.
10319104	10319905	We don't have no life
10348567	10354189	Alright, we're going to open up the Skype line now, but it's the lightning round, kids.
10354609	10355689	This is the lightning round.
10356750	10358070	Put in some thunder here.
10358510	10362791	It's the lightning round of our Skype line being open because you only get two minutes.
10363612	10365632	Because we're almost out of time.
10365812	10366493	That's not thunder.
10366513	10370234	Alright, here we go.
10372726	10373247	That is Bethany.
10373607	10374808	Hi, you're on Orange Silence Radio.
10375008	10375349	Hello.
10375669	10377310	Obviously, I need no introduction.
10377350	10378191	You already know who this is.
10378211	10378532	Two minutes, Daku.
10378552	10379052	Two minutes.
10379572	10379973	Go.
10380693	10388380	Alright, basically, when I was in the MTV thing, they are going to be... The DDR player they're going to be doing it on is this cat named Sketch.
10388701	10389982	He's one of the best players in the industry.
10390002	10390763	Like, literally a cat?
10391894	10395256	No, I mean it in a noun way.
10395276	10397637	Look, there's this DDR player named Sketch.
10397997	10399878	Okay, I'll stop taking away your minutes.
10399898	10401299	Go ahead.
10401759	10402719	He's a freestyler.
10405000	10405821	No, go ahead.
10406001	10407101	S versus being a smartass.
10407121	10409543	Keep talking.
10411023	10412124	Great, he broke his train.
10414046	10418688	As I said, all they're really going to focus on is him.
10418728	10421910	He's the only DDR player that they shine their cameras on.
10422950	10438317	They just basically asked him a few questions about his playing skills, and apparently they even went as far as making him breakdance on a carpeted floor on the stage.
10440017	10440357	Okay.
10443496	10449250	So, pretty much, he will be in an MTV Overdrive special, I think, on Tuesday.
10449975	10454696	But the segment will probably air this Tuesday, you know, in that episode of Direct Effect.
10454816	10457317	So... I'm already setting up my TiVo.
10457337	10459097	You'll definitely get a glimpse of him.
10459497	10460358	Zach, who am I going to see?
10460398	10462578	Am I going to see you on the TiVo?
10462618	10466379	So, you're probably going to be saying... You're probably going to be, you know, TiVo it, I assume.
10467399	10469200	Yeah, I'm going to TiVo it.
10469740	10474361	And basically critique it like we always do with other things.
10474661	10475001	We'll see.
10475701	10476402	Are you going to be on it?
10476442	10477242	Another thing, um...
10480523	10488166	One of the hosts from Direct Effect actually had the gall to walk out of the stage when she refused to do a segment again.
10490267	10491707	She refused to retake a segment.
10492588	10498150	Fucking Lala Vasquez, the host of Direct Effect, who was pretty damn clueless about DDR to begin with.
10499329	10501192	So she was like, what the hell is DDR?
10501232	10503034	Is that that game with all the... Time's up.
10503275	10504837	Alright, next call.
10505718	10506860	Hi, you're on Orange Science Radio.
10507040	10507440	Who's this?
10507661	10508542	Hey, this is GS191.
10508722	10510264	Hi, two minutes.
10510605	10510905	Hurry up.
10510925	10511927	Alright, what's up?
10511967	10514130	Hey, you didn't save my FUs, man.
10514150	10514470	Jeez.
10514891	10515291	I didn't?
10515351	10516213	I'm sorry, I didn't mean to.
10517375	10518096	Oh, that's okay, man.
10518236	10519477	Well, you got two minutes.
10519537	10519977	Go for it.
10520558	10521158	Yeah, man.
10521718	10527723	My FU was Best Buy because I just started there like about a week ago.
10527743	10528083	Uh-huh.
10528103	10528344	Uh-huh.
10529925	10532026	And now they want me to come in at 4 a.m.
10532067	10533348	in the morning on Black Friday.
10534268	10534729	Oh, my God.
10534749	10535910	Are you having to work Tuesday?

10598842	10602924	OrangeLogsRadio.com He's not, I'm afraid of the stalkers more than he is.
10604425	10604725	Okay.
10604785	10606426	Alright, a minute twenty, what else is on your mind?
10607386	10610308	Uh, I score as a DDL club now, which is like pretty cool.
10611209	10611389	Yeah.
10612199	10612499	Cool.
10613000	10613540	Where's that at?

10621026	10622027	We're in Ohio.
10622568	10622848	Okay.
10623488	10626751	Yeah, and now you can see I've only done a few rounds of DDR.
10626971	10628573	It's called 3.
10629013	10629373	Yeah.
10629894	10632936	Are you guys going to be bringing Ultramix 3 into your club?
10634398	10636739	Uh, I really have no clue.
10636960	10638341	Alright, I thought I'd ask.
10639110	10641752	Nothing that I really know other than ADR.
10668157	10672679	What we used to do in high school is we used to order pizza and then do whatever our club thing was.
10672719	10674120	Do you guys do pizza in DDR?
10675301	10677322	Not that I know of.
10677402	10677902	Oh, okay.
10678483	10686648	One thing is I was at two TV saloons, so we didn't have two going on.
10686888	10687668	And that's two minutes.
10687929	10688289	All right.
10689209	10690370	Well, the lightning round's fun.
10690650	10691591	Jeez, you're a bitch.
10692788	10694390	Okay, you're going to get off my line right now.
10694450	10695511	Okay, bye, bye, bye.
10695911	10699254	I know, and then I talk and take up their whole two minutes, but that's part of the fun of it.
10700295	10701576	You know what?
10701696	10708603	The lightning round, I know, I cut Zaku off so bad, I'm so sorry, but I think we need to institute the lightning round every time we do Skype.
10708663	10709203	That's fun.
10709844	10710344	It is fun.
10710685	10711365	See what I love doing?
10711385	10714688	Do you see how I coaxed him to talk for 30 more seconds just so I could hang up on him?
10718092	10720795	Yeah, I feel bad, but it's still funny, so you should still do it.
10720815	10721656	All right, show's over.
