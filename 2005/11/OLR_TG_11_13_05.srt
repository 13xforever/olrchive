Orange Lounge Radio To Go Edition, week of November 14th, 2005.

2
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:09,400
You're tuned in to the Orange Lounge Radio To Go Edition,

3
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:13,700
your podcast home for all the latest video game news and gamer chat.

4
00:00:13,700 --> 00:00:17,600
Now, here are your hosts, DarkSakura, Sky, and Logan.

5
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:25,800
Hello, everybody! Once again, welcome to another episode of Orange Lounge Radio To Go,

6
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:30,960
You're home from latest gaming news about video games that don't suck, all the news

7
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:31,960
you really want to know about.

8
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:35,820
You know, once in a while, though, we do have to talk about games that do suck, but just

9
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:37,920
to remind you to avoid them.

10
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:38,920
My name is Rob Roberts.

11
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:39,920
You might know me as Skye.

12
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:42,400
Joining me tonight, the one and only TecmasaLoki.

13
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:43,880
Yep, it's me.

14
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:45,400
How you doing?

15
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:46,400
I'm doing good.

16
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:50,440
All right, and DarkSakura, as we mentioned last week, she's been representing us at the

17
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:54,840
podcast awards this weekend, so she is not able to be here with us tonight.

18
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:57,380
She'll be back next week for sure.

19
00:00:57,380 --> 00:01:00,700
But she did pass along a special message for everyone, and we'll be reading that a little

20
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:01,700
bit later.

21
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:04,520
But we're going to start off tonight's show, and usually we start off with a little bit

22
00:01:04,520 --> 00:01:08,180
of How Was Your Gaming Week, but I want to change that a little bit tonight, because

23
00:01:08,180 --> 00:01:11,640
I just want to get this off my chest, because I've kind of been thinking about this quite

24
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:17,740
a bit this week, and I think I've decided that I don't want to get an Xbox 360 on launch

25
00:01:17,740 --> 00:01:18,740
day anymore.

26
00:01:18,740 --> 00:01:22,880
Like, I was all hyped up about getting the Xbox 360 the day it was coming out on launch

27
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:28,040
and I was ready to fight those lines at Best Buy and Target or wherever I decided to end

28
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:30,680
up going, Toys R Us, which I think will probably be one of the best places, and now I'm just

29
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:35,520
like, after reading about all these horrible, horrible delays, and reading about, now, Lokey,

30
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:38,840
didn't your system get delayed, in fact? You were supposed to get one, you reserved it

31
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:39,840
months ago?

32
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:41,080
Yeah, but I have my theories on this too.

33
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:44,960
Oh yeah, what do you think, before I continue to rant?

34
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:48,520
My theory is that they're not going to be as short-handed as they think they are. I

35
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:50,900
I think Microsoft purposefully told them

36
00:01:50,900 --> 00:01:52,780
they're getting less than they actually are.

37
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:55,820
So, okay, you pre-ordered 200 for your store.

38
00:01:55,820 --> 00:01:57,980
They said, oh, well you're only gonna get 50,

39
00:01:57,980 --> 00:02:00,180
they actually ship you 100, or something like that.

40
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:02,280
So, those people that thought that they weren't

41
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:04,740
gonna get them, they got lucky and they got some,

42
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:07,180
so Microsoft looks like the hero now,

43
00:02:07,180 --> 00:02:08,920
but still they're still cutting them short

44
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:10,020
and they still sell out

45
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:11,900
and there's still the media hype about it.

46
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:15,500
Well, it's backfiring, because I was interested,

47
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:16,700
but after hearing about all the shortness,

48
00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:18,540
Wait, do I really want to deal with this crap?

49
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:21,500
Do I really want the system that badly at launch?

50
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:24,140
And it kind of made me re-evaluate what games are

51
00:02:24,140 --> 00:02:26,620
coming out at launch after playing the kiosk and stuff.

52
00:02:26,620 --> 00:02:29,240
And sure, I'm not being anti-Microsoft with this

53
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:29,620
statement.

54
00:02:29,620 --> 00:02:32,100
I will get an Xbox 360 eventually, but I'm just

55
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:34,780
going, do I really want to buy into this launch hype?

56
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:36,820
Is there any game that's coming out on launch day I

57
00:02:36,820 --> 00:02:37,740
really, really want?

58
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:39,420
And I'm thinking to myself, you know what?

59
00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:41,020
No, there isn't.

60
00:02:41,020 --> 00:02:41,940
I mean, I can wait.

61
00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:43,900
I can wait until January or later.

62
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:46,020
And come to think of it, there's very few systems that

63
00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:50,540
bought on launch. The last one was the Nintendo DS, but before that I can't really think of

64
00:02:50,540 --> 00:02:55,340
what system I probably bought on launch day. So, it can wait. But I know I've been kind

65
00:02:55,340 --> 00:02:58,060
of going back and forth on that for a while, so who knows. I reserve the right to change

66
00:02:58,060 --> 00:03:03,140
my mind before the official D-Day in what, like nine days or so? Where are we? Well,

67
00:03:03,140 --> 00:03:06,920
it depends on what day you're listening to this podcast, but you know, we're very little

68
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:10,140
time left. But I'm just like, you know what, for all that money, especially if they're

69
00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:15,300
going to be pushing me to buy two games out the door and everything, and all this other

70
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:16,640
accessory crap i'm just like you know

71
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:18,480
what maybe push they're not going to

72
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:21,560
require it and you know I have my own

73
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:23,280
qualms with I've read about how they're

74
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:24,720
going to be doing this whole thing at

75
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:26,460
Best Buy and how they like want you to

76
00:03:26,460 --> 00:03:27,660
buy all this stuff and they're hoping

77
00:03:27,660 --> 00:03:29,460
they spend six hundred dollars at their

78
00:03:29,460 --> 00:03:30,240
store

79
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:32,360
well the hell with them I had the

80
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:34,680
remember those free Best Buy bucks they

81
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:36,720
had the money for from McDonald's thing

82
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:38,200
and all that wonderful stuff

83
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:39,640
well I like about thirty one dollars of

84
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:41,120
this stuff so I was going to go buy

85
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:43,320
Shadow Colossus there and just say hey

86
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:44,640
okay cool I get the game for like three

87
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:51,480
bucks or whatever. No! You can only use three dollars on a game DVD or CD. I'm like where

88
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:56,480
does it say that on this? Well it doesn't say on this. It's on the giant paper. I'm

89
00:03:56,480 --> 00:04:01,760
like what giant paper? Do they want to see the giant paper? It's like it almost made

90
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:06,080
me think like I was going to go see the Wizard of Oz or something like that because you know

91
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:09,920
oh he wants to see the giant paper? No not the giant paper. No one has to see the giant

92
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:16,920
It's like, what the hell? So I basically went and got, you know, a spool of blank DVDs instead in the mall.

93
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:21,920
Is this good enough for ya? No, that's fine. I'm like, shit, god.

94
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:26,920
Then I went and spent my money elsewhere. But I did pick up shallow classes.

95
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:29,920
Well don't derail my Xbox 360, dog. Sorry, sorry.

96
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:33,920
That's probably what every gaming podcast is going to talk about this week is Xbox 360.

97
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:36,920
But I'm going to say I'm probably not going to buy it.

98
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:45,920
I've pretty much decided in my mind that my money is better spent on current Xbox, PlayStation 2, and GameCube games, and the 360 thing can wait until January.

99
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:55,920
I'm just gonna... I have, like, what? Tons of games pre-ordered. I have four games pre-ordered right now, with a possible fifth being pre-ordered later this week because I have store credit.

100
00:04:55,920 --> 00:05:05,920
I'm going to be getting the games. In the system, I have a feeling I'm not going to be waiting that much longer, even if it is not launch day, which I still think it probably is going to be launch day.

101
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:09,920
I'm still going to get one probably pretty soon, whenever they decide to ship more.

102
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:16,920
So I'm not really that concerned about not being there. I don't want to wait in line in the morning.

103
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:18,920
You know what if I I

104
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:25,560
Let some kid who really wants the Xbox 360 for some game. They've got to freakin have on the day one

105
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:27,480
You know what? I'm being nice

106
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:32,760
I'm stepping aside because you don't want to see me with my claws out in the line waiting to get one of these systems

107
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:38,160
So I'm being nice. I'm stepping aside. I will wait so one of you more eager kids can go get your Xbox

108
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:39,560
Well, yeah a nice thing

109
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:45,080
What game stuff told me as I have their pre-ordered mind back in May in order to get one that's before

110
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:50,280
Or, you know, they even announced the price point or anything for the system.

111
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:54,040
That'd be like me booking the revolution right now, which I should probably go do anyway

112
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:55,360
since, you know...

113
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:58,840
Seriously, if I want a revolution on launch day, maybe I ought to go pre-book that now.

114
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:02,400
I'm worried I'm not going to get Mario Kart DS on Tuesday, because it seems like everybody

115
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:04,360
and their sister wants that game.

116
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:05,360
Mine's already working.

117
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:06,360
Crazy.

118
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:09,520
Um, I do want to mention this before, I mean this is a little bit of a news story, but

119
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:12,920
it's kind of some late breaking news that's coming in as we are taping, because we tape

120
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:15,920
on Sunday nights, and we're getting this story.

121
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:20,640
It's actually coming off of Joystick with Q.com, and they're saying that Circuit City

122
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:24,940
is advertising on their website, and you can actually see this on their website, CircuitCity.com,

123
00:06:24,940 --> 00:06:29,760
that they will be selling 360s on Friday at 2 p.m. Eastern Standard Time.

124
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:34,380
Now, of course, the initial thought when you see this is, okay, they're going to sell it

125
00:06:34,380 --> 00:06:40,160
on their website, and you order it on the website, and they'll ship it to you by Tuesday

126
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:41,160
or something, right?

127
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:45,060
they're really breaking the launch day, but the weird thing is that this article

128
00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:48,780
says they actually called the customer service line and they spoke to a

129
00:06:48,780 --> 00:06:52,660
customer service rep and they're saying that every physical Circuit City

130
00:06:52,660 --> 00:06:56,420
location will be selling the console this Friday at 2 p.m. Eastern and just

131
00:06:56,420 --> 00:07:00,980
to be sure they called back and double-checked just to make sure that

132
00:07:00,980 --> 00:07:04,260
they indeed were selling this and they said yes it will be available this

133
00:07:04,260 --> 00:07:09,740
Friday at 2 p.m. Eastern Time online as well as at our stores. So our thought was

134
00:07:09,740 --> 00:07:13,280
we'll call our local Circuit City in check, but unfortunately since we taped Sunday night

135
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:19,520
and it's about 8.40 now, we missed the boat, because they closed at 8, so we didn't get

136
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:20,520
a chance to call.

137
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:23,340
Did people still shop at Circuit City?

138
00:07:23,340 --> 00:07:28,340
I bought my video card there, they're still a fine store.

139
00:07:28,340 --> 00:07:29,340
Last thing I bought...

140
00:07:29,340 --> 00:07:30,880
Crappy location in this area.

141
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:34,780
Just to give you some reference, the last thing I bought at Circuit City was your Game

142
00:07:34,780 --> 00:07:35,780
Cube.

143
00:07:35,780 --> 00:07:38,980
Wow, that was a long time ago, that was a Christmas present like three years ago?

144
00:07:38,980 --> 00:07:43,980
Long time ago. No, I had my car alarm installed in Circuit City. They're still around.

145
00:07:43,980 --> 00:07:47,980
Well, I shouldn't be giving them a free plug, but they do the free installation and everything, so...

146
00:07:47,980 --> 00:07:49,980
Well, I don't know.

147
00:07:49,980 --> 00:07:54,980
If I really didn't have one pre-ordered and already paid for, I might go look there, but I don't care.

148
00:07:54,980 --> 00:07:59,980
I don't know. I have a feeling this might change by Monday, Tuesday, when you guys are actually hearing this podcast,

149
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:06,980
but this is something that's late-breaking, so keep an eye on CircuitCity.com if you want to try and beat the rush, so to speak.

150
00:08:06,980 --> 00:08:10,620
Although, you know, with every gaming site reporting this, who knows, everybody and their

151
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:15,620
sister is probably going to be lining up to get an Xbox 360 on Friday from Circuit City.

152
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:19,860
That's going to be a lot of interesting phone calls, if it isn't true.

153
00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:24,440
Anyway, let's do a little bit of how is your gaming week, what games you've been playing

154
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:25,900
this week, and what you're up to.

155
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:27,620
Loki, you mentioned Shadow of the Colossus?

156
00:08:27,620 --> 00:08:30,460
Yes, I was playing that today.

157
00:08:30,460 --> 00:08:36,220
I've gotten through already six of the Colossus's, and I think there's only 12, and it only took

158
00:08:36,220 --> 00:08:41,200
two hours and it wasn't that hard but I mean you think there might be like a

159
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:45,460
hidden ending or a hidden level like like Symphony of the night upside down castle

160
00:08:45,460 --> 00:08:48,460
type thing well I know you can play through it more times and I think there

161
00:08:48,460 --> 00:08:52,220
are some stuff you unlock and I know there's a harder difficulty and stuff

162
00:08:52,220 --> 00:08:56,620
like that so there's more of that and the only thing that really kind of

163
00:08:56,620 --> 00:09:00,160
peeves me about this game is you're actually kind of fighting two enemies at

164
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:05,140
the same time the Colossus and the camera because the camera does not want

165
00:09:05,140 --> 00:09:09,980
to freaking focus on anything correctly. I have to constantly control it with the right

166
00:09:09,980 --> 00:09:14,920
analog stick while trying to fight this thing. And there's a button to focus in on the colossus

167
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:20,660
kind of like... it reminds me of Mega Man Legends where you can target stuff and that

168
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:26,940
works really well. This does not work very well. Also, I get lost quite a bit trying

169
00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:30,540
to figure out where the hell I'm supposed to be going in this game. And there's really

170
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:35,860
nothing else you know running around in the environment other than the environment looking

171
00:09:35,860 --> 00:09:41,480
really beautiful pretty much you know you kill colossus you come back to this temple

172
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:46,260
thing to tell you what colossus you have to fight next you go find it kill it and you

173
00:09:46,260 --> 00:09:52,220
know wash rinse and repeat it's just i don't know but it's a good game i mean there's some

174
00:09:52,220 --> 00:09:56,140
pretty amazing stuff like i fought one that was like an eagle type thing so i had to grab

175
00:09:56,140 --> 00:10:02,580
onto this thing and fly around and that wasn't too fun, but I managed to do it and also fall

176
00:10:02,580 --> 00:10:07,220
off of it numerous times into water and get very pissed off yelling at the TV.

177
00:10:07,220 --> 00:10:08,220
But I don't know.

178
00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:09,220
It was a really fun game.

179
00:10:09,220 --> 00:10:12,020
Well it sounds like it's a game you can really get into then.

180
00:10:12,020 --> 00:10:13,740
Sometimes yelling at the TV makes a really good game.

181
00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:18,320
Well I was frustrated because I'm trying to grab ahold of this one part of it and it keeps

182
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:21,540
grabbing some other part of it and I'm like, son of a bitch!

183
00:10:21,540 --> 00:10:23,540
Do what I want you to do!

184
00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:28,380
And so, that was kind of annoying, but then, I don't know, I'll probably play through it

185
00:10:28,380 --> 00:10:31,260
and be done with it, and that's it.

186
00:10:31,260 --> 00:10:34,060
The other game I've been playing is Grand Theft Auto Liberty City Stories.

187
00:10:34,060 --> 00:10:39,060
I've been playing this twice a day, a break, and kicking the crap out of my co-workers.

188
00:10:39,060 --> 00:10:43,580
I am fucking awesome with the rocket launcher.

189
00:10:43,580 --> 00:10:44,980
Just no competition.

190
00:10:44,980 --> 00:10:47,500
I'm tempted to check that out.

191
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:51,180
I've not been that into Grand Theft Auto.

192
00:10:51,180 --> 00:10:55,120
I understand why it does so well critically and commercially, but

193
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:58,580
for me personally it's not really my kind of game. But I am kinda tempted to

194
00:10:58,580 --> 00:11:01,940
check out this PSP one if for no other reason I need more games for my PSP.

195
00:11:01,940 --> 00:11:05,560
Um, the multiplayer is the best part. I love it. And this

196
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:08,760
should have been something they really had in all of them. I think

197
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:12,160
this is something that should have been in San Andreas,

198
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:16,880
Vice City, because it's really fun and it's even another reason to buy the game.

199
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:17,700
And

200
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:21,560
I mean just do it with the amount of players that you can do it in the PSP like six or

201
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:23,120
eight players you know or whatever

202
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:27,140
and just have it online and be able to play that way I think it'd be really fun and you can

203
00:11:27,140 --> 00:11:29,340
get some really good tournaments and stuff going along

204
00:11:29,340 --> 00:11:34,520
I'm hopefully in the next reiteration of this which is coming out exclusively on

205
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:35,440
the PS3

206
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:39,560
will have something multiplayer on it because I think it really needs it or

207
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:41,280
even two player co-op would be awesome

208
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:45,360
Good ideas. So anything else you've been playing besides those two?

209
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:52,360
That's it. I've got a lot of stuff lined up for this week, but that's about it. I've got Gun and Matrix.

210
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:53,360
Sounds good. Path of Neo?

211
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:53,860
Yeah.

212
00:11:53,860 --> 00:11:55,360
I've heard some good things about that game.

213
00:11:55,360 --> 00:12:02,860
Looks good. Then there's more stuff coming out this week, I know, or it'll be Need for Speed Most Wanted is coming out.

214
00:12:02,860 --> 00:12:07,860
I can already tell you, UltraMix 3 is out this week, and Mario Kart DS.

215
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:08,860
Yeah, I'm getting DS'd.

216
00:12:08,860 --> 00:12:14,860
Honestly, I mean, have no time to dance with Mario Kart DS out. I mean, everybody's hyping this game.

217
00:12:14,860 --> 00:12:21,860
If it's the letdown Double Dash was, I'm gonna be pissed, but they're saying they did not screw with the formula this time, so...

218
00:12:21,860 --> 00:12:29,860
They redid the, um, the, um, what was it, multiplayer, um, stuff, but it's good. The stuff that they did with it is really good, so...

219
00:12:29,860 --> 00:12:30,860
We'll see.

220
00:12:30,860 --> 00:12:33,860
And the fact that we can play online, oh hell yes.

221
00:12:33,860 --> 00:12:39,860
We'll see, we'll see. I'm excited. This is, you know, this is a very interesting week if you think about it.

222
00:12:39,860 --> 00:12:44,940
this is a huge week in that this is almost epic in that this is where

223
00:12:44,940 --> 00:12:46,740
Nintendo is finally

224
00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:50,260
embracing online and granted I mean you could

225
00:12:50,260 --> 00:12:55,500
you know get me on a little loopholes like you know a fantasy star online for

226
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:57,700
the GameCube but let's face it that was a Sega game

227
00:12:57,700 --> 00:13:01,260
was established before the GameCube you could say you know that stuff that was

228
00:13:01,260 --> 00:13:04,340
in Japan with the fancy Zelda and F-Zero tracks and stuff

229
00:13:04,340 --> 00:13:07,340
those little things aside this is really the first like true

230
00:13:07,340 --> 00:13:11,180
embracing of online that Nintendo's doing that we're gonna see this week with

231
00:13:11,180 --> 00:13:12,160
Mario Kart DS.

232
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:15,180
That's a big ass deal to me, seeing as that

233
00:13:15,180 --> 00:13:18,860
I think one of the places where the GameCube could have done a lot better

234
00:13:18,860 --> 00:13:19,820
was with

235
00:13:19,820 --> 00:13:22,820
online support. I think the GameCube would have been a more successful and threatening

236
00:13:22,820 --> 00:13:24,580
system if they'd been online, but

237
00:13:24,580 --> 00:13:27,900
you know, some folks differ with me there, but I think...

238
00:13:27,900 --> 00:13:30,980
I'm still waiting for their announcement on December 9th.

239
00:13:30,980 --> 00:13:35,820
December 9th, folks, this is the day before the Japanese launch of the 360. They're

240
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:37,720
they're gonna drop a bomb, so...

241
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:38,720
We'll see.

242
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:39,720
You know, we have a...

243
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:40,720
Well, because last...

244
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:44,360
For those of you guys that heard last week's show, Loki made his case for why he thinks

245
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:48,200
the big revolution is stereoscopic 3D, and I think I have something tonight that's gonna

246
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:49,760
even add to that case.

247
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:50,760
We'll get there in a little bit.

248
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:51,760
But first I want to talk about my gaming week.

249
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:52,760
Go ahead.

250
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:56,500
I've been promising to talk about Taito Legends for like three weeks now, and now I will finally

251
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:59,720
say something about Taito Legends, which I checked out on the Xbox.

252
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:01,160
Not a bad deal for 20 bucks.

253
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:05,380
There's some really rock solid games that you love in this collection.

254
00:14:05,380 --> 00:14:10,140
Bubble Bobble, Rainbow Islands, two games I remember, Elevator Action, of course, that

255
00:14:10,140 --> 00:14:14,700
game was badass as well, Space Invaders, lots of cool retro games, but of course for all

256
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:18,740
the cool retro games there's a lot of weird crap in there as well, like stuff I'd never

257
00:14:18,740 --> 00:14:23,580
really heard of, kind of filler, if you will, nothing else, but you know for 20 bucks it's

258
00:14:23,580 --> 00:14:27,120
not a bad deal, and sometimes that filler can be a good thing, like there was one particular

259
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:32,720
game in there, I want to say it was New Zealand Story, and it was something I'd never really

260
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:36,360
played before. I'd heard of it, but I'd never really played it before, and it was actually

261
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:39,500
kind of a cool game, like it was one of those things where I was like, oh, I wish I knew

262
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:42,640
about this when it was the arcades, but it was probably a small game. So some little

263
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:47,000
gems in there as well, so if you're into the retro collection thing, a lot of good games

264
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:50,800
for 20 bucks, I would recommend it for you. If you're not into the retro collections,

265
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:54,680
nothing here is going to win you over, but you know, arcade perfect bubble bobble on

266
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:58,880
your console, it's pretty cool, you know, unless you're already into the main thing,

267
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:01,960
Come on, support these guys a little bit. It's 20 bucks! Not that bad.

268
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:05,840
So, I know, that was a little short review of Title Legends, but what else can I

269
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:08,940
really say about it? And another game I got to check out, I went to a little party

270
00:15:08,940 --> 00:15:10,680
yesterday for a web forum I'm on,

271
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:14,720
and got to check out some new games at this party. Mario Party 7 being one of

272
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:15,060
them.

273
00:15:15,060 --> 00:15:18,720
And I don't even know if I can really review Mario Party 7. I mean, what the hell

274
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:19,600
can I say about it?

275
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:25,920
You've seen 4, 5, 6 on the GameCube, and 3, 2, 1 before that on the Nintendo 64.

276
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:29,540
yeah it is a player's that was the first is we actually played innate player game

277
00:15:29,540 --> 00:15:33,740
and use half the controller in the eight player game like you and a friend hold

278
00:15:33,740 --> 00:15:35,320
on see have to get you know close quarters

279
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:38,640
but a una friend each hold half the controller and when you

280
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:42,060
uses the sea stick there will be yellow sea stick in the right trigger

281
00:15:42,060 --> 00:15:45,620
and the other person uses the left analog controller in the left blocker

282
00:15:45,620 --> 00:15:48,940
so works out you do you know a player and you can do teams around-the-board

283
00:15:48,940 --> 00:15:51,240
we even did an eight-player gamer on the board and

284
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:55,280
myself and explain half one of course I am very much

285
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:56,800
Princess Peach?

286
00:15:56,800 --> 00:16:00,920
Hell yes, as always, Princess Peach and uh... Nick Latov was toad, so...

287
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:02,160
it worked out.

288
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:03,440
We kicked butt.

289
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:05,440
Uh, anyway, but

290
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:06,960
those guys are probably pissed off at me.

291
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:08,960
Uh, anyway, no, we had a good time.

292
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:12,360
I mean, honestly, I don't know what else I can say about it. You know if you like

293
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:15,460
these kind of Mario Party games, I don't think they make very good single-player

294
00:16:15,460 --> 00:16:16,360
games at all.

295
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:18,520
So if you're the type of person that games by yourself,

296
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:21,480
I don't think there's a whole lot here for you, although there are single-player

297
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:23,000
modes.

298
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:29,000
You know what? There are some pretty cool mini-games. There was a couple cool puzzle mini-games in it.

299
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:37,000
This one where there were these balls that were falling. It kind of reminded me of this old ass arcade game I used to play at Golf Land called Battle Balls.

300
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:42,000
Did you ever remember this game? It was like a Japanese import game where it had these marbles that were falling and you had to stack them.

301
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:46,000
It was kind of like, I don't know, I can't even explain it. It was like a Tetris type game.

302
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:52,000
Well, they have something like that in this, except it's a rotating sphere that you let the balls fall into.

303
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,940
fall into. So there's some kind of cool minigames. So you know what? I think there would be some

304
00:16:55,940 --> 00:17:00,740
cool stuff in here if you are a single player, you know, but to get the full potential of

305
00:17:00,740 --> 00:17:03,460
this game, you've got to be the type of person that has friends over a lot, or you've got

306
00:17:03,460 --> 00:17:06,740
a big family, so there's always somebody there to play the game with you. I think you'd get

307
00:17:06,740 --> 00:17:10,700
more value out of it that way. But it does seem to be a better Mario Party game than

308
00:17:10,700 --> 00:17:16,860
the last couple I played. I didn't particularly enjoy 5 or 6 as much as 4, although most other

309
00:17:16,860 --> 00:17:21,100
people I've talked to say that 4 is the weakest. That wasn't my personal opinion, but 7 is

310
00:17:21,100 --> 00:17:24,740
pretty solid entry so if you've kind of been lagging on the Mario Party series

311
00:17:24,740 --> 00:17:27,220
7 is a good one to come back to and it does have the microphone support again.

312
00:17:27,220 --> 00:17:31,980
Another game I checked out was Karaoke Revolution Party which I'd

313
00:17:31,980 --> 00:17:34,780
played a little bit at E3 but I got to see the full release of the game and

314
00:17:34,780 --> 00:17:38,200
again this is one of those games where I don't really see the value in it if

315
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:41,940
you're going to be playing by yourself unless you want to practice singing

316
00:17:41,940 --> 00:17:45,260
because it's a darn good way to see like if you're tone deaf or not with

317
00:17:45,260 --> 00:17:48,780
Karaoke Revolution because if you're not familiar with this game basically it

318
00:17:48,780 --> 00:17:52,220
it shows you the lyrics on screen like regular karaoke, but it scrolls by

319
00:17:52,220 --> 00:17:56,140
and there's pitch bars and you actually sing into either your... now this is out

320
00:17:56,140 --> 00:17:58,500
on multiple systems, it's out on all the major systems

321
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:02,380
but the version I played was on Xbox, and you can actually use your Xbox Live headset

322
00:18:02,380 --> 00:18:06,500
as a microphone, but the game also has a bundle that comes with a

323
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:08,060
you know, holding microphone if you want

324
00:18:08,060 --> 00:18:11,400
but it actually gauges your pitch as a little arrow so you can see exactly, you

325
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:13,860
know, if you're tone deaf the game will tell you, you know, honestly

326
00:18:13,860 --> 00:18:16,500
how you're doing.

327
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:19,740
So that's kind of how it works. So I could see maybe a little bit of single player value

328
00:18:19,740 --> 00:18:21,900
and that you know you want to be a better singer but

329
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:25,740
this is really more the kind of thing where you know again if you have people

330
00:18:25,740 --> 00:18:28,660
around a lot, you're an entertainer type with your video games,

331
00:18:28,660 --> 00:18:31,980
you'd probably get a lot of value out of Karaoke Revolution Party because I'll tell you

332
00:18:31,980 --> 00:18:33,620
at this party it was a hit.

333
00:18:33,620 --> 00:18:35,620
Everybody got on there and was doing the

334
00:18:35,620 --> 00:18:39,980
random medley, because you can do little medleys of five songs and just do random.

335
00:18:39,980 --> 00:18:41,800
So random songs would come up.

336
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:45,060
And the interesting thing about Karaoke Revolution Party is that the song list

337
00:18:45,060 --> 00:18:49,800
is very eclectic. There really is something for everyone, which is a strong point and

338
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:54,840
a weak point, because the fact that there's something for everyone means that you really

339
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:58,880
only really, really like five or six songs on the list, and then the rest are kind of

340
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:03,720
like, oh, I know that song, oh, I know that song. It didn't really focus on one genre.

341
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:07,680
What I think is interesting about the Xbox version is that you can expand the song list

342
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:13,320
via Xbox Live. There are 100 songs available on Xbox Live for download, and you can either

343
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:18,260
download a block of five songs in a genre for five dollars each or you can

344
00:19:18,260 --> 00:19:22,100
download the whole shebang all one hundred songs for eighty bucks

345
00:19:22,100 --> 00:19:24,420
holy crap i don't know who'd want to spend eighty bucks that you have to be

346
00:19:24,420 --> 00:19:28,460
a hell that's really good yeah i mean there's a lot of expansiveness to this

347
00:19:28,460 --> 00:19:29,580
game so

348
00:19:29,580 --> 00:19:33,340
certainly the song list will not grow stale

349
00:19:33,340 --> 00:19:38,140
you're gonna have to spend eighty maybe a hundred dollars to really expand it

350
00:19:38,140 --> 00:19:41,460
but you know if you're willing to spend five dollars here five dollars there

351
00:19:41,460 --> 00:19:44,220
you can at least buy the genres, because at least it breaks it out into genres.

352
00:19:44,220 --> 00:19:46,140
You could buy like, okay, if I want to buy all the rock

353
00:19:46,140 --> 00:19:47,940
packs, that would be like ten dollars.

354
00:19:47,940 --> 00:19:50,100
You know, if you're more of a rock music fan. So that's...

355
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:52,000
okay, that's cool.

356
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,240
I would recommend Karaoke Revolution.

357
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:58,340
Again, this is one of those games where you already know if this game is for you.

358
00:19:58,340 --> 00:20:01,540
It is definitely the strongest Karaoke Revolution title to date

359
00:20:01,540 --> 00:20:04,420
because, you know, there's been three other volumes released. This one has

360
00:20:04,420 --> 00:20:07,660
create a character, this one has the sing and dance mode,

361
00:20:07,660 --> 00:20:11,180
and both of those just really add to what was already a really, you know,

362
00:20:11,180 --> 00:20:15,500
unique game, so definitely the strongest entry in the series so far. Check it out

363
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:20,140
if you're a fan of the music games. And so those are the games I checked out

364
00:20:20,140 --> 00:20:25,460
this week. Cool. Alright, let's move on to some gaming news. What's going on in the

365
00:20:25,460 --> 00:20:30,380
gaming world? Let's talk about the Xbox 360. You know, we're talking about that

366
00:20:30,380 --> 00:20:34,860
little bit at the start of the show, and I'm sure you guys are sick of Xbox 360

367
00:20:34,860 --> 00:20:38,840
dominating the news and everything, but let's face it, it's out in like 10 days, so we

368
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:40,360
have to talk about it

369
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:44,720
compatibility list finally released over xbox dot com exactly which games

370
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:48,840
they will be backwards compatible supporting and yes it is apparently

371
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:53,280
going to be using an emulator type thing because only about two hundred titles or

372
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:58,400
so are emulatable so well so far so far they say they are going to expand to it

373
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:01,760
but you do notice a couple things that are missing right off the bat such as

374
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:04,000
dance dance revolution ultra mix

375
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:07,800
uh... some of the other things such as uh... i notice midway arcade treasures

376
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:09,220
wasn't on there

377
00:21:09,220 --> 00:21:13,760
and some of the other like older Xbox titles. There's some weird stuff on that list that's all I

378
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:17,160
gotta say. But most, you know what, and I know a lot of people are saying this

379
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:18,680
like why is

380
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:24,040
Barbie on the list and uh... you know these aliens versus predator and some of

381
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:26,560
these games that weren't standards you know you have

382
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:30,260
this alongside Halo 2, Halo, Fable

383
00:21:30,260 --> 00:21:35,800
you know all the games, Ninja Gaiden and all the games you would expect Xbox

384
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:40,060
360 to be emulating. My thought is, is like

385
00:21:40,060 --> 00:21:43,800
if you are familiar with emulating of games at all, like

386
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:47,420
for instance take Nintendo emulation, there's like

387
00:21:47,420 --> 00:21:52,280
I think, and please don't quote me on this, but I think there's like 13 common

388
00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:53,160
mappers

389
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:56,720
and like maybe a hundred not so common mappers and once you can get

390
00:21:56,720 --> 00:22:00,520
one of the maps to work in your emulator, usually you can get all the games that work

391
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:01,240
on that map

392
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:05,180
to work in the emulator, you know what I mean? Okay, yeah. So I think it's kind of like a

393
00:22:05,180 --> 00:22:08,420
a similar thing with this like once you get one type of game to work you

394
00:22:08,420 --> 00:22:10,660
probably get a whole bunch of them to work if that's what they're doing is the

395
00:22:10,660 --> 00:22:14,620
emulation so that's probably why you see games like Barbie in here because you

396
00:22:14,620 --> 00:22:18,260
know maybe by getting Ninja Gaiden to emulate it took five seconds to get

397
00:22:18,260 --> 00:22:21,900
support for Barbie whereas a game like Ultra Mix or something will probably

398
00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:25,780
take a little more effort that's my thought so that's why I'm not freaking

399
00:22:25,780 --> 00:22:29,220
out about this the stuff that they picked to be on this list because

400
00:22:29,220 --> 00:22:32,020
obviously they went for their standards and they just haven't gotten around to

401
00:22:32,020 --> 00:22:37,540
rest of it yet. But another question was answered and that was, if I bought

402
00:22:37,540 --> 00:22:41,660
something, if I bought premium content on the Xbox, will I be able to transfer it

403
00:22:41,660 --> 00:22:46,540
over to the Xbox 360? No, you will not be able to transfer it to the Xbox 360. So

404
00:22:46,540 --> 00:22:51,780
don't shelve your Xbox console or sell it back just yet if you use your premium

405
00:22:51,780 --> 00:22:55,580
content that's on there because you will have to re-buy it on Xbox 360, at least

406
00:22:55,580 --> 00:23:00,140
that's what we're hearing right now. So far, I mean, that might change later,

407
00:23:00,140 --> 00:23:03,340
if they figure out a way to do certain things.

408
00:23:03,340 --> 00:23:04,620
I somehow don't think it will.

409
00:23:04,620 --> 00:23:08,420
Although, if you are a Dance Game fan, I did see on the list Pump It Up

410
00:23:08,420 --> 00:23:12,900
Exceed was on there, so that is one game you'll at least be able to play

411
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:16,860
on the fewest. And I don't think that was Microsoft saying we prefer Pump It Up to

412
00:23:16,860 --> 00:23:19,160
DR or any of that crap, I think it's just again,

413
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:22,140
you get one game to work and Pump It Up worked as well. There's no problem though.

414
00:23:22,140 --> 00:23:23,500
How are you going to play it on the dance pad?

415
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:28,020
Oh! Damn! Good thought, good thought. Is it not the same controller ports?

416
00:23:28,020 --> 00:23:32,500
I assumed it was the same controller parts. I don't really research some of these things.

417
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:34,540
There are no controller ports.

418
00:23:34,540 --> 00:23:37,620
What about... no, there's a wired controller that you get in one pack?

419
00:23:37,620 --> 00:23:39,440
USB.

420
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:42,500
Oh, duh. That makes too much sense for my feeble brain.

421
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:49,180
No, what they could do is a USB adapter, since the actual Xbox controllers are...

422
00:23:49,180 --> 00:23:50,020
I'm sure there's already...

423
00:23:50,020 --> 00:23:54,980
...modified USB. There's probably already an Xbox to USB so people could use those things on their computer.

424
00:23:54,980 --> 00:23:58,020
I'm not sure that the game would recognize and that's a problem

425
00:23:58,020 --> 00:24:02,340
but I don't know. I'm sure this stuff will come out later but

426
00:24:02,340 --> 00:24:05,740
at least it's available. You can play it on the controller.

427
00:24:05,740 --> 00:24:10,940
Alright, speaking of music games, we have a couple other music game news things I

428
00:24:10,940 --> 00:24:12,340
want to get to you guys.

429
00:24:12,340 --> 00:24:16,380
Beatmania, which is, you know, one of the first

430
00:24:16,380 --> 00:24:20,020
games that really kicked off the whole Bomani trend over at Konami.

431
00:24:20,020 --> 00:24:24,500
Beatmania USA is coming out. We have a release date for that and it's

432
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:28,580
February 8th. Yep. So we're hearing is the release date for that and Loki you were the one that picked up on this, right?

433
00:24:28,580 --> 00:24:32,500
Yep, just came in on your calendar. That's what Konami sent over to us so far

434
00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:35,500
Of course, you know with the dates shuffling like crazy

435
00:24:36,300 --> 00:24:41,940
That could move but that's what they've given us so far and we actually have a solid date for it. So

436
00:24:42,820 --> 00:24:46,140
Who knows but tentative should be pretty cool

437
00:24:46,140 --> 00:24:51,340
And speaking of beat mania if you are the type that imports your beat mania from Japan like I did for a long time

438
00:24:51,340 --> 00:24:57,340
TenStyle is on its way out very, very soon. I think it's next week as well.

439
00:24:57,340 --> 00:25:04,340
TenStyle has the song list up, and what's very interesting is that there's a very interesting crossover in it.

440
00:25:04,340 --> 00:25:10,340
Jelly Kiss, Midihead's SmackMix from UltraMix 3 is crossing over into 2DX TenStyle,

441
00:25:10,340 --> 00:25:16,340
which is interesting because if you follow the music gaming forums, people have been saying that Midihead needs to be in 2DX for a long, long time.

442
00:25:16,340 --> 00:25:21,340
And you know the other footnote I have to this, Midihead is going to be on the show next week.

443
00:25:21,340 --> 00:25:25,340
We're going to have an interview with him, so I'm going to ask him exactly what he thinks about this.

444
00:25:25,340 --> 00:25:28,340
We'll have Midihead on next week's show.

445
00:25:28,340 --> 00:25:31,340
Let's see, what else is going on here in the gaming world?

446
00:25:31,340 --> 00:25:35,340
Let's talk about this, because this made me squeeze like a little fanboy.

447
00:25:35,340 --> 00:25:38,340
It was beautiful. I think I shed a tear over this.

448
00:25:38,340 --> 00:25:40,340
I forgave Squeenix over this.

449
00:25:40,340 --> 00:25:42,340
I'm going to sound like such a nerd, but I don't care.

450
00:25:42,340 --> 00:25:46,860
Kingdom Hearts 2. Did you see those pictures coming out of Famitsu magazine?

451
00:25:46,860 --> 00:25:50,460
I'm sorry, not Famitsu, I'm just kidding. Jump Magazine was the

452
00:25:50,460 --> 00:25:54,640
magazine that released this. Kingdom Hearts 2 characters

453
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:57,580
in Tron outfits. Awesome.

454
00:25:57,580 --> 00:26:00,820
Meaning that Tron is a level in Kingdom Hearts 2.

455
00:26:00,820 --> 00:26:04,820
I forgive them for the delay. They show stuff from Tron. Yeah, they show screenshots and stuff.

456
00:26:04,820 --> 00:26:08,420
Great. That is very exciting. I do like seeing them

457
00:26:08,420 --> 00:26:14,300
crossover into these other non-animated movie genres and stuff like that like

458
00:26:14,300 --> 00:26:17,700
the Pirates of the Caribbean and that I think is a really good way... Did you hear about Steamboat

459
00:26:17,700 --> 00:26:21,260
Willy? Somebody at the party yesterday was telling me about Steamboat Willy is one of the

460
00:26:21,260 --> 00:26:26,180
stages too, I didn't know that. Retro Mickey or something, like old style. Yeah, old, old style.

461
00:26:26,180 --> 00:26:31,620
I think that's awesome and this is also another plea out there. Square Enix needs to

462
00:26:31,620 --> 00:26:37,100
get back with Nintendo and give us a real sequel to Super Mario RPG. I'm

463
00:26:37,100 --> 00:26:42,340
telling it because imagine this if you take this this kind of same style but

464
00:26:42,340 --> 00:26:45,980
with actual Nintendo games and the Nintendo characters and stuff and just

465
00:26:45,980 --> 00:26:49,420
make it like Nintendo RPG or something like that I would that I would like to

466
00:26:49,420 --> 00:26:52,620
give another plea over to Squeenix because I'm sure Kingdom Hearts 3 is

467
00:26:52,620 --> 00:26:55,980
inevitable and I would just like to issue a friendly reminder to Squeenix

468
00:26:55,980 --> 00:27:03,740
that Disney now has the license to the Muppets think about it thank you could

469
00:27:03,740 --> 00:27:07,020
be disastrous, but it could be the greatest thing ever as well.

470
00:27:07,020 --> 00:27:08,020
Think about it.

471
00:27:08,020 --> 00:27:09,020
That's all I'm asking.

472
00:27:09,020 --> 00:27:10,020
Think about it.

473
00:27:10,020 --> 00:27:14,480
All right, now of course I said we'd have a special message from the one and only Dark

474
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:22,380
Sakura who went to the Podcast Awards this weekend, and if you didn't hear, over at podcastawards.com

475
00:27:22,380 --> 00:27:26,560
earlier this year they did some nominating and voting, and we somehow actually won the

476
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:31,740
award for Best Gaming Podcast thanks to our awesome, awesome legion of fans, and so Dark

477
00:27:31,740 --> 00:27:37,140
Dark Sakura went down to LA this Friday to pick up that award, and she files this report.

478
00:27:37,140 --> 00:27:40,640
We were going to Skype her in tonight to talk about this, but unfortunately due to connection

479
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:44,340
issues and just the fact that Dark Sakura is also really, really tired, she just sent

480
00:27:44,340 --> 00:27:48,660
this over to me over text messenger, so I'm going to read this to you guys right now,

481
00:27:48,660 --> 00:27:51,740
her little report from LA.

482
00:27:51,740 --> 00:27:52,740
She says,

483
00:27:52,740 --> 00:27:54,780
The drive to LA was a pain in the arse.

484
00:27:54,780 --> 00:27:58,380
I've had a nasty cold and it's proceeded to get worse during the trip.

485
00:27:58,380 --> 00:28:03,200
The next day was spent on homework and a two-hour drive to Ontario from Anaheim.

486
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:06,080
An hour of that was spent on the five alone.

487
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:09,480
Her friend Julie, Kasumi19, went with me on the adventure.

488
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:14,560
We arrived and met up with Frank of The Overnightscape, a podcast out of New Jersey.

489
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:18,260
He's a big gamer too, apparently, so we sat with him during the ceremony.

490
00:28:18,260 --> 00:28:22,520
We also met someone from madpod.com sat with us too.

491
00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:25,240
The issue when we tried to get in was that we didn't have badges.

492
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:28,120
I said, we're Orange Lounge Radio, we won an award.

493
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:31,320
They said, ìWill you be here tomorrow?î She said, ìNo.î And they said, ìFine, just

494
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:34,320
go in.î

495
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:39,360
Julie and her Dark Sakura helped themselves to the free food and they sat there mesmerized

496
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:43,240
by Adam Curry, who apparently was standing just a foot away from their table.

497
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:46,600
And I remember when I talked to Jamie on the phone, she didnít shut up about Adam Curryís

498
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:48,000
hair, so I thought it was funny.

499
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:51,660
And she would also like to say, ìFor the record, he still looks fabulous.î Anyway,

500
00:28:51,660 --> 00:28:56,180
they let the first three awards winners talk, one being Mr. Curry himself, and then the

501
00:28:56,180 --> 00:29:01,380
People's Choice winners went up, had pics taken, and got shooed off.

502
00:29:01,380 --> 00:29:08,220
We have a $25 Visa gift card and plastic trophy, pictures of which will be on the site soon.

503
00:29:08,220 --> 00:29:09,220
Woohoo!

504
00:29:09,220 --> 00:29:10,220
$25!

505
00:29:10,220 --> 00:29:12,860
That's a higher budget than we've ever had for this show.

506
00:29:12,860 --> 00:29:16,060
I thought we won some web design package or blog design.

507
00:29:16,060 --> 00:29:18,620
I have no idea.

508
00:29:18,620 --> 00:29:19,620
Did they chip us?

509
00:29:19,620 --> 00:29:21,060
Did they jack our prize?

510
00:29:21,060 --> 00:29:22,060
I don't care.

511
00:29:22,060 --> 00:29:23,060
Whatever.

512
00:29:23,060 --> 00:29:25,060
It's not a big deal.

513
00:29:25,060 --> 00:29:27,060
Uh, anyway, DarkStalker continues.

514
00:29:27,060 --> 00:29:31,060
After that, I mostly hung around talking to Frank and was interviewed for his podcast,

515
00:29:31,060 --> 00:29:34,060
so I feel inclined to give his, uh, podcast a plug.

516
00:29:34,060 --> 00:29:35,060
TheOvernightScape.

517
00:29:35,060 --> 00:29:38,060
www.TheOvernightScape.com

518
00:29:38,060 --> 00:29:42,060
He's awesome and his podcast was one of the nominees in the political social talk, I believe.

519
00:29:42,060 --> 00:29:43,060
Very cool guy.

520
00:29:43,060 --> 00:29:45,060
At any rate, that's it for me.

521
00:29:45,060 --> 00:29:47,060
I do have one bit of advice for the column tonight.

522
00:29:47,060 --> 00:29:50,060
Don't try to park on a hill in Julian, California,

523
00:29:50,060 --> 00:29:52,060
because it is friggin' impossible,

524
00:29:52,060 --> 00:29:53,060
and never trust directions.

525
00:29:53,060 --> 00:29:54,060
Ever.

526
00:29:54,060 --> 00:30:02,420
get a map! That from our very own DarkSakura who will be back next week and

527
00:30:02,420 --> 00:30:06,660
you know one more time and then we'll shut up about this awards thing just a

528
00:30:06,660 --> 00:30:09,240
big thank you to all our fans out there we also want to say thank you to the

529
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:13,840
other nominees in the category because we were up against some awesome indie

530
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:17,760
talent in the video gaming category so we want to say congratulations as well

531
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:20,800
to the guys over at DreamStation.cc,

532
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:23,760
Yankadank over at Gamers RadioCast,

533
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:27,120
Industry Insider Gaming Steve and his podcast over there,

534
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:30,260
as well as RPG MP3,

535
00:30:30,260 --> 00:30:33,840
world's largest dungeon audio review because they do awesome jobs on their

536
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:34,880
podcasts as well.

537
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:38,880
We are all independent and this is probably the only year where the nominees

538
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:41,000
are going to read like that because I bet you next year

539
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:44,560
with all the built-in audience that some of those corporate podcasts have, not to knock

540
00:30:44,560 --> 00:30:46,520
on the corporate podcasts, you know, they're doing a good thing for the

541
00:30:46,520 --> 00:30:51,160
community, 1UP and GameSpot and all them, but, you know, probably us indies are gonna

542
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:54,520
have a harder time standing out next year, so, guys, we're gonna have to enjoy this

543
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:55,520
while it lasts.

544
00:30:55,520 --> 00:31:00,160
So, congratulations to you guys as well for being nominated.

545
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:02,500
But you know, how much Mountain Dew do you think it takes to get through the world's

546
00:31:02,500 --> 00:31:03,500
largest dungeon?

547
00:31:03,500 --> 00:31:04,500
That's what I'm curious about.

548
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:07,680
I don't know, but they have that new energy drink now, so...

549
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:08,680
That's true.

550
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:16,280
And who was it, someone that we knew, it was a 48 hours, oh, VX, oh yeah, was that by 48

551
00:31:16,280 --> 00:31:19,280
Yeah, 48 hours with that stuff.

552
00:31:19,280 --> 00:31:20,280
I'm sure they drink a lot of that.

553
00:31:20,280 --> 00:31:22,280
I tease, because I love.

554
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:25,280
Alright, moving on.

555
00:31:25,280 --> 00:31:28,280
This is something about Nintendo that's pissed me off for a long time.

556
00:31:28,280 --> 00:31:31,280
But this plays into something you were talking about last week.

557
00:31:31,280 --> 00:31:36,280
You know how I've been pissed off that Nintendo's not going to support the revolution.

558
00:31:36,280 --> 00:31:39,280
Nintendo's not going to support HD with the revolution.

559
00:31:39,280 --> 00:31:42,280
And as somebody who recently bought an HD TV, that kind of pissed me off.

560
00:31:42,280 --> 00:31:45,280
Because I wanted to see Nintendo kind of embrace the HD technology like everyone's doing.

561
00:31:45,280 --> 00:31:48,940
doing and there was kind of this they said this a long time ago but there were

562
00:31:48,940 --> 00:31:53,260
rumors just very recently that they were going back on this well here's the thing

563
00:31:53,260 --> 00:31:58,380
there was an interview on CNN money and they chatted with a Nintendo of America

564
00:31:58,380 --> 00:32:04,700
executive VP of sales and marketing Reggie Philz I'm a and he said that what

565
00:32:04,700 --> 00:32:09,780
will offer in terms of game gameplay and approachability will more than make up

566
00:32:09,780 --> 00:32:15,860
for the lack of HD. And I'm thinking, shit, this just buys into what Loki said last week

567
00:32:15,860 --> 00:32:21,260
about the stereoscopic 3D. It all makes sense. They can't do it on an HD TV, that's why they're

568
00:32:21,260 --> 00:32:27,240
not going to support it. Because then it goes on to say that when you have the HD support,

569
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:31,140
you have really long loading times as well. And I kind of noticed that Halo kind of seems

570
00:32:31,140 --> 00:32:34,720
to load a little longer than it used to. I don't know, maybe it's just I'm insane, but

571
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:38,500
it seems to have a slightly longer load time. I don't mind waiting a little bit longer for

572
00:32:38,500 --> 00:32:43,020
pretty games, but maybe this all buys into what you're- we'll find out!

573
00:32:43,020 --> 00:32:44,300
We'll find out early December.

574
00:32:44,300 --> 00:32:45,300
I think it'll be cool.

575
00:32:45,300 --> 00:32:46,300
We'll see.

576
00:32:46,300 --> 00:32:48,180
Loki, what do you have for us tonight?

577
00:32:48,180 --> 00:32:50,540
Um, a couple things.

578
00:32:50,540 --> 00:32:56,020
First thing will be kind of... let's see here.

579
00:32:56,020 --> 00:33:03,340
My favorite topic of discussion is how hackers have broken the PSP.

580
00:33:03,340 --> 00:33:07,700
And Sony's really having trouble with their copy protection stuff this week, you know,

581
00:33:07,700 --> 00:33:15,660
the whole CDDRM rootkit thing that they put out there and how not only is Microsoft pissed

582
00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:21,900
off at them and also California as a state is suing them and now the government's coming

583
00:33:21,900 --> 00:33:22,900
after them.

584
00:33:22,900 --> 00:33:29,620
Well, on top of all that, people have found a way to exploit the version 2.5 firmware.

585
00:33:29,620 --> 00:33:31,700
Sony, it's just not your day.

586
00:33:31,700 --> 00:33:32,700
It's just not your day today.

587
00:33:32,700 --> 00:33:34,220
It's just never going to happen.

588
00:33:34,220 --> 00:33:35,780
Listen, Sony, you've got to understand...

589
00:33:35,780 --> 00:33:37,180
Don't launch the PS3 right away.

590
00:33:37,180 --> 00:33:39,140
You might want to wait a little bit on that because you're not having good luck right

591
00:33:39,140 --> 00:33:40,140
now.

592
00:33:40,140 --> 00:33:46,840
You got to understand there's never ever going to be a way to fully 100% get the PSP to be

593
00:33:46,840 --> 00:33:48,940
able to not run homebrew.

594
00:33:48,940 --> 00:33:49,940
It's never going to happen.

595
00:33:49,940 --> 00:33:51,380
They seriously should just give up.

596
00:33:51,380 --> 00:33:56,940
I guess they have a moral responsibility to be patching this stuff, but honestly.

597
00:33:56,940 --> 00:34:01,700
Okay, well no downgrade has been released yet, but there's been a new exploit that's

598
00:34:01,700 --> 00:34:08,060
that's been put out there, where they've actually found a way to create a TIFF file to cause

599
00:34:08,060 --> 00:34:13,820
a buffer overflow the same way that they did it with version 2.0 firmware to be able to

600
00:34:13,820 --> 00:34:16,260
break it and run their own code.

601
00:34:16,260 --> 00:34:24,340
The other thing that's actually happened, and it was reported on psp3d.com I believe,

602
00:34:24,340 --> 00:34:29,580
they actually had a version of that exploit that they converted into a save file.

603
00:34:29,580 --> 00:34:36,500
So basically you load the save file either in a game or just in their save file browser

604
00:34:36,500 --> 00:34:39,340
thing there to actually be able to launch this.

605
00:34:39,340 --> 00:34:42,460
And there's a boot bin file where you can launch your own code.

606
00:34:42,460 --> 00:34:49,260
So in theory this should work to be able to run a down grader later on or something to

607
00:34:49,260 --> 00:34:50,420
that effect.

608
00:34:50,420 --> 00:34:55,660
Of course a new firmware update is expected and I believe the new thing that they're adding

609
00:34:55,660 --> 00:35:01,260
with the new firmware is going to be e-book reader. I actually saw the story on this.

610
00:35:01,260 --> 00:35:03,180
Okay, that's cool.

611
00:35:03,180 --> 00:35:08,340
Be interesting. I think it's kind of pointless. Maybe a web browser with, I don't know, Java

612
00:35:08,340 --> 00:35:12,200
support would be nice.

613
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:16,500
So that's that. The other thing that was kind of cool is they were showing some screenshots

614
00:35:16,500 --> 00:35:20,500
of the Gradius collection that's going to be coming out.

615
00:35:20,500 --> 00:35:23,920
That's exciting. That's definitely a PSP game I got to pick up.

616
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:31,660
So it's going to be nice, they showed both the pan and scan version of the old games

617
00:35:31,660 --> 00:35:34,980
and then the widescreen version, which is kind of neat.

618
00:35:34,980 --> 00:35:35,980
Very exciting.

619
00:35:35,980 --> 00:35:36,980
Yeah.

620
00:35:36,980 --> 00:35:39,220
Alright, let's go over to our mailbag and read a couple of emails that have come in

621
00:35:39,220 --> 00:35:40,580
to us this week.

622
00:35:40,580 --> 00:35:46,060
If you want to email us, togo at orangeloungeradio.com is the place to send those emails, togo at

623
00:35:46,060 --> 00:35:47,460
orangeloungeradio.com.

624
00:35:47,460 --> 00:35:51,560
And we might read your letter on the air, just like we're going to read these folks.

625
00:35:51,560 --> 00:35:57,440
email comes to us from the goo the self-proclaimed DDR King of

626
00:35:57,440 --> 00:36:02,800
Charlottesville Virginia well bow down to the DDR King hey guys love the

627
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:07,800
podcast helps to make my workday fly by like I am high on drugs now I know you

628
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:11,080
are all addicted to the Bahmani games as much as me and here is where you can

629
00:36:11,080 --> 00:36:15,840
flaunt your geekness and help me out all at the same time dance dance documentary

630
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:19,840
Where or where do I find it? Help-a-honkey-out.

631
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:25,840
You know, I googled it. I couldn't find it. I have no idea where you can get this movie.

632
00:36:25,840 --> 00:36:32,840
I was interviewed for some movie that they were doing on DDR, and I don't know if this is the same one or not.

633
00:36:32,840 --> 00:36:35,840
I think it was, and it never came to be.

634
00:36:35,840 --> 00:36:42,840
No, if you go to Internet Movie Database, you can actually see dance dance documentary on Internet Movie Database.

635
00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:45,880
and this is what I really want to talk about sorry buddy I don't know where you

636
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:48,600
can get this movie because I have I cannot find a website where they are

637
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:52,320
selling this movie but I was drawn to this entry on internet movie database

638
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:56,440
because it actually has like a full entry here in a review and it's like

639
00:36:56,440 --> 00:37:00,200
what's going on does it show your name is one of the actors no but it shows

640
00:37:00,200 --> 00:37:04,260
other people that we know very well like Mel B and some of the other people in

641
00:37:04,260 --> 00:37:07,600
the community they're all listed here and they have internet movie database

642
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:11,160
entries how cool is that like you could click on Mel here and get to his whole

643
00:37:11,160 --> 00:37:17,400
page, almost like he's a card-carrying member of the Screen Actors Guild now or something.

644
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:20,720
That's kind of, I don't know, that cracked me up, as a long-time member of the Bomani

645
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:22,440
community, this cracked me up.

646
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:25,680
You know, and this, a lot of this was filmed at the Cyberbeat Nation tourney, which was

647
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:30,540
this huge tournament years ago, and you and I were both there, so we might be in the background

648
00:37:30,540 --> 00:37:35,040
of this movie somewhere, if nothing else, but no internet movie database page for us

649
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:36,040
yet.

650
00:37:36,040 --> 00:37:37,040
We'll see.

651
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:41,040
of, you know, Orange Lunch Radio either. Very, very disappointing.

652
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:45,040
That's alright. What kind of a documentary do you think it is if you don't get

653
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:49,040
all sides of the topic? We didn't have a podcast at the time, because this came

654
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:53,040
out in 2004, so we didn't have a podcast that time, so nobody cared then.

655
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:57,040
Oh, okay. Even though we've been doing this for, you know, what, three and a half years?

656
00:37:57,040 --> 00:38:01,040
Let's go on to another email. We had another email.

657
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:05,040
It's our buddy, Dekeman, saying, hi, I'm back from Canada

658
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:08,300
Have just finished catching up on the last month or so worth of shows

659
00:38:08,300 --> 00:38:13,640
I heard you guys read out some release lists for the US and the UK but nothing for Australia

660
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:18,600
So he sent us a link and you know checking out the frapper. You know we were plugging the frapper last week

661
00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:23,120
I didn't realize like every freaking podcast out there has a frapper because like now this week

662
00:38:23,120 --> 00:38:27,120
I'm looking at other sites and like put yourself on the frapper put yourself on the frapper

663
00:38:27,120 --> 00:38:31,740
I'm like oh wow we apparently jumped on this bag bandwagon real way late, but it's still cool

664
00:38:31,740 --> 00:38:36,880
So put yourself on the front for orange lounge, but looking at the frapper. We have some pins in Australia

665
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:40,420
So we got to recognize our Aussie fan base. I don't like about the frappers

666
00:38:40,420 --> 00:38:43,820
I can't actually put myself where I live and said it's just city

667
00:38:43,820 --> 00:38:45,660
You don't want them to come to your house

668
00:38:45,660 --> 00:38:50,660
You know, you might have some you might have some very angry Mac owners and in the groove players that would come

669
00:38:50,660 --> 00:38:53,460
You know bring in. Yeah, whatever. Anyway, here's some things that are coming out in

670
00:38:54,500 --> 00:38:57,220

00:39:16,220 --> 00:39:19,220
you guys are getting WWE SmackDown vs. Raw

677
00:39:19,220 --> 00:39:21,220
which honestly I never really got into the wrestling games

678
00:39:21,220 --> 00:39:23,220
but I know some folks are into them so whatever

679
00:39:23,220 --> 00:39:27,220

680
00:39:27,220 --> 00:39:30,220
Sega Classics Collection, you guys are finally getting on 10th of December.

681
00:39:30,220 --> 00:39:35,220
And then on into 2006, you guys will be getting Oz, which I don't even think we're getting here.

682
00:39:35,220 --> 00:39:39,220
You guys are getting that on 28th of February, so feel lucky about that one.

683
00:39:39,220 --> 00:39:42,220
And then on March 13th, you guys are getting Godfather.

684
00:39:42,220 --> 00:39:44,220
Of course, that all being on the PlayStation 2.

685
00:39:44,220 --> 00:39:46,220
You want to go to some other systems.

686
00:39:46,220 --> 00:39:51,220
Over in Australia, you guys are getting King Kong for the Xbox on 17th of November.

687
00:39:51,220 --> 00:39:56,220
Half-Life 2 on 21st of November, and if you go to some other systems such as the GameCube,

688
00:39:56,220 --> 00:40:02,220

December, and over on the DS you guys are getting Burnout Legends on the 12th of December,

690
00:40:07,220 --> 00:40:10,220
and Phoenix Wright, Ace Attorney, 28th of February.

691
00:40:10,220 --> 00:40:15,220
I like how sometimes they get games before us, like King Kong isn't here until the week

692
00:40:15,220 --> 00:40:16,220
of the 21st.

693
00:40:16,220 --> 00:40:21,580
first. Mm-hmm. Just interesting the way it works out sometimes. Yeah. So there

694
00:40:21,580 --> 00:40:26,340
you go. Can't say we don't love you guys down in Australia, so there you go. One

695
00:40:26,340 --> 00:40:32,100
other mail I wanted to read for you guys here. This one is coming from Edmund, and

696
00:40:32,100 --> 00:40:35,180
Edmund wanted to send us something about the Video Games Live, and you know, we

697
00:40:35,180 --> 00:40:39,220
were kind of, we were kind of, you know, dogging on Video Games Live a little bit.

698
00:40:39,220 --> 00:40:42,780
He wanted to send a positive review about Video Games Live, because unlike us,

699
00:40:42,780 --> 00:40:46,980
he actually got to go to the show in Vancouver, so he wants to share what was

700
00:40:46,980 --> 00:40:50,580
going on. He said the show was great, great sound, great lighting. The

701
00:40:50,580 --> 00:40:54,140
production values were great. Each piece was accompanied by game footage. It was

702
00:40:54,140 --> 00:40:57,460
an incredible combination. The show started with what they called classic

703
00:40:57,460 --> 00:41:01,420
arcade medley. This segment started with the primitive beeps and boops from games

704
00:41:01,420 --> 00:41:04,980
like Pong, Space Invaders, and Defender, and then transitioned into the games

705
00:41:04,980 --> 00:41:08,100
with some sorts of music in it like Donkey Kong. Okay, good, that doesn't sound

706
00:41:08,100 --> 00:41:11,220
as hokey as I thought that was gonna be, so I'm really glad that that is kind of,

707
00:41:11,220 --> 00:41:15,220
you know, was the way they opened. That sounds cool. Lastly, they played music

708
00:41:15,220 --> 00:41:19,220
from the classics with true orchestration like Dragon's Lair and Outrun.

709
00:41:19,220 --> 00:41:23,220
They proceeded to play music from games like Metal Gear Solid, Zelda,

710
00:41:23,220 --> 00:41:27,220
God of War, Beyond Good and Evil, Castlevania, Myst, Warcraft, Advent Rising,

711
00:41:27,220 --> 00:41:31,220
Halo, etc. The show was an astounding orchestral experience.

712
00:41:31,220 --> 00:41:35,220
I believe that both gamers and non-gamers would enjoy it equally. It's too bad that they had

713
00:41:35,220 --> 00:41:39,220
to cancel most of their shows. So, a positive review

714
00:41:39,220 --> 00:41:41,760
of the show coming to us from Edmond.

715
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:43,300
Again, if you want to send us an email,

716
00:41:43,300 --> 00:41:46,740
togoatorangeloungeradio.com is the place to send it,

717
00:41:46,740 --> 00:41:49,180
and we hope we'll be reading your email

718
00:41:49,180 --> 00:41:50,600
on a future podcast.

719
00:41:50,600 --> 00:41:51,580
For now, back to the news.

720
00:41:51,580 --> 00:41:52,820
Loki, what do you got for us?

721
00:41:52,820 --> 00:41:56,220
Okay, the other things I was gonna be mentioning.

722
00:41:56,220 --> 00:41:57,440
There's a ton of stuff, of course,

723
00:41:57,440 --> 00:41:59,580
of the 360 launch going on.

724
00:41:59,580 --> 00:42:02,140
Some things I have that I found really funny.

725
00:42:02,140 --> 00:42:03,940
The first one being, of course,

726
00:42:04,840 --> 00:42:06,380
the golden tickets that are beginning.

727
00:42:06,380 --> 00:42:08,540
The golden ticket, the green golden tickets.

728
00:42:08,540 --> 00:42:11,700
The golden tickets are being given out at Walmart.

729
00:42:11,700 --> 00:42:14,140
I think those are just hilarious.

730
00:42:14,140 --> 00:42:16,220
Apparently, this is one of those things.

731
00:42:16,220 --> 00:42:18,900
They're going to be handling their first come, first serve

732
00:42:18,900 --> 00:42:19,800
type line thing.

733
00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:21,000
But you get a ticket.

734
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:22,540
What's great about the thing, though,

735
00:42:22,540 --> 00:42:24,700
is the tickets are a little bit confusing.

736
00:42:24,700 --> 00:42:27,220
They are for the opposite of the colored box

737
00:42:27,220 --> 00:42:28,340
that they're supposed to be.

738
00:42:28,340 --> 00:42:29,740
So the green tickets are for the white box,

739
00:42:29,740 --> 00:42:30,980
and the white tickets are for the green.

740
00:42:30,980 --> 00:42:32,740
Oh, that won't cause any confusion at all.

741
00:42:32,740 --> 00:42:34,140
Actually, no, I take that back.

742
00:42:34,140 --> 00:42:34,640
I'm sorry.

743
00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:36,060
They're for the same boxes.

744
00:42:36,060 --> 00:42:38,300
However, their little form tells them

745
00:42:38,300 --> 00:42:44,860
which ones which, the white box is going to be the $2.99 and the green box being $3.99

746
00:42:44,860 --> 00:42:50,140
of course for all those who are pre-ordering those, those are completely opposite.

747
00:42:50,140 --> 00:42:54,020
So some people hopefully will be getting their systems for $100 less than they would have

748
00:42:54,020 --> 00:42:58,420
to be paying, which I think is quite funny.

749
00:42:58,420 --> 00:43:03,900
The other thing which is interesting, and this is completely on a different subject

750
00:43:03,900 --> 00:43:10,900
here. Actually, same subject, Xbox 360 Zero Hours, an event that's been going on in the

751
00:43:11,680 --> 00:43:12,780
Mojave Desert.

752
00:43:12,780 --> 00:43:19,140
Oh yeah, I wanted to see if we could go to that, but real work calls. We'll be able to

753
00:43:19,140 --> 00:43:19,820
do it.

754
00:43:19,820 --> 00:43:24,640
In order to get a ticket, they were doing this Blitz thing on Thursday actually, where

755
00:43:24,640 --> 00:43:29,900
you would have, I believe there's like 12 sites participating, all the major gaming

756
00:43:29,900 --> 00:43:33,580
and for basically they're giving out

757
00:43:33,580 --> 00:43:37,420
what do you mean all the major gaming sites we weren't in on it yeah we don't

758
00:43:37,420 --> 00:43:39,620
have an actual huge budget like they do okay

759
00:43:39,620 --> 00:43:44,460
they only have $25 now remember oh I'm sorry you have a $25 budget now

760
00:43:44,460 --> 00:43:48,260
no anyways so they were giving out I believe each site was giving out about

761
00:43:48,260 --> 00:43:49,740
360 tickets

762
00:43:49,740 --> 00:43:53,100
and then the rest of them were going to be randomly

763
00:43:53,100 --> 00:43:56,500
drawn actually on Monday

764
00:43:56,500 --> 00:44:01,800
so we'll find out who gets to go. 3,000 people including VIPs

765
00:44:01,800 --> 00:44:05,280
which will be contest winners from the Origin website

766
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:10,320
and of course the Hex 168 site will be going there and you'll be

767
00:44:10,320 --> 00:44:14,120
greeted with 48 hours of pure gaming fun

768
00:44:14,120 --> 00:44:17,000
and celebrities. So it's like Burning Man with more games and less nudity?

769
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:22,000
Yeah. Okay. And celebrities who really have no point being there

770
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:24,440
Also, it's like the E3 booth.

771
00:44:24,440 --> 00:44:28,240
Yeah, and you also get to buy your Xbox 360

772
00:44:28,240 --> 00:44:31,680
a whole couple hours earlier than everybody else.

773
00:44:31,680 --> 00:44:35,720
Big misconception. They're not going to be handing you one out the door. You get to buy it.

774
00:44:35,720 --> 00:44:38,640
Will they be forcing you to take two games with it?

775
00:44:38,640 --> 00:44:42,120
Well, it is the Best Buy booth, so possibly.

776
00:44:42,120 --> 00:44:44,760
But yeah, that's going to be...

777
00:44:44,760 --> 00:44:46,520
This just leads into what I was talking about at the beginning of the cast, why I'm not doing this.

778
00:44:46,520 --> 00:44:48,320
Why I'm just not going to do it anymore.

779
00:44:48,320 --> 00:44:51,800
Well, here's why. It makes sense when you find out why

780
00:44:51,800 --> 00:44:55,640
they're trying to force games on you. In order to

781
00:44:55,640 --> 00:45:00,560
be able to have Xboxes at launch, you have to promise Microsoft you're going to do

782
00:45:00,560 --> 00:45:02,840
ten million dollars in business by the end of the year.

783
00:45:02,840 --> 00:45:05,720
Or else what?

784
00:45:05,720 --> 00:45:08,920
Or else what? They're going to slap you on the wrist?

785
00:45:08,920 --> 00:45:12,040
What, you're going to give a severe penalty to a big

786
00:45:12,040 --> 00:45:16,160
company like Best Buy? Crap, if I were a company like that, I'd pull your crap off

787
00:45:16,160 --> 00:45:18,840
my shelves. Good luck selling your damn system under these rules.

788
00:45:18,840 --> 00:45:26,840
Okay, I'm just some gaming fan with a little podcast, maybe I don't understand the bigger scope of things, so I'm sure I'll get emails on that, but whatever.

789
00:45:26,840 --> 00:45:30,840
You have to understand, they don't care. They don't care. You're nobody to them.

790
00:45:30,840 --> 00:45:31,840
Yeah, I know.

791
00:45:32,840 --> 00:45:36,840
It's my money, dammit! I should be somebody. The customer is always right.

792
00:45:36,840 --> 00:45:43,840
Anywho, in other news, I will file an error. It was bound to happen sooner or later.

793
00:45:43,840 --> 00:45:50,840
Nintendo is talking about possibly redesigning the DS, a la the, you know...

794
00:45:50,840 --> 00:45:52,840
Oh, so I can buy it again?

795
00:45:52,840 --> 00:45:53,840
Yeah!

796
00:45:53,840 --> 00:45:55,840
Oh, just like how there's like 50 different Game Boys out there I could buy?

797
00:45:55,840 --> 00:45:56,840
Exactly.

798
00:45:56,840 --> 00:45:57,840
Oh, what a shock!

799
00:45:57,840 --> 00:46:04,840
So, yeah, Reggie feels, I may drop the hint that the DS may be due for a redesign.

800
00:46:04,840 --> 00:46:08,840
Basically, yeah, it's not a surprise.

801
00:46:08,840 --> 00:46:12,920
They're gonna make it sleeker, I guess, and smaller and yadda yadda yadda yadda.

802
00:46:12,920 --> 00:46:15,920
Not a big surprise.

803
00:46:15,920 --> 00:46:20,520
Yeah. Alright, I got a story over here. NCSoft, you know NCSoft, they make

804
00:46:20,520 --> 00:46:21,400
Guild Wars.

805
00:46:21,400 --> 00:46:24,840
NCSoft is saying that they are going to be

806
00:46:24,840 --> 00:46:28,240
working on a console game. Chief Executive

807
00:46:28,240 --> 00:46:32,280
Tack Jin Kim mentioned that they were developing for the next generation

808
00:46:32,280 --> 00:46:33,360
consoles, but

809
00:46:33,360 --> 00:46:36,920
they're not saying exactly what they're doing, but if you think about it, well,

810
00:46:36,920 --> 00:46:38,640
they do MMOs,

811
00:46:38,640 --> 00:46:42,420
so that would seem like the most logical thing they're gonna put out

812
00:46:42,420 --> 00:46:45,060
but who knows anything is possible and I would think if they're gonna put out an

813
00:46:45,060 --> 00:46:45,820
MMO

814
00:46:45,820 --> 00:46:49,380
Xbox 360 is probably gonna be where they gravitate to but who knows

815
00:46:49,380 --> 00:46:52,860
anything's possible at this juncture but we do know NCSoft will be developing something

816
00:46:52,860 --> 00:46:56,380
I thought I'd want you to support Guild Wars to the console I bet a lot of

817
00:46:56,380 --> 00:47:00,060
people might get a kick out of that but what do I know? Again

818
00:47:00,060 --> 00:47:04,860
I'm just I'm just some guy. For those people who like to play games on their

819
00:47:04,860 --> 00:47:05,620
computer

820
00:47:05,620 --> 00:47:09,000
that they shouldn't be playing shame shame shame the emulators

821
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:12,980
yeah anyways I'm so there's gonna be a there was a long-awaited mod

822
00:47:12,980 --> 00:47:17,020
that takes a legends although the ocarina of time and updates the graphics

823
00:47:17,020 --> 00:47:20,020
with high-res textures well it's finally out folks

824
00:47:20,020 --> 00:47:23,300
I'm course you will need me on the raw man

825
00:47:23,300 --> 00:47:28,060
emulator to play it anyways I'm you can definitely find this link at a four

826
00:47:28,060 --> 00:47:28,860
color

827
00:47:28,860 --> 00:47:32,380
rebellion dot com and that's I won the

828
00:47:32,380 --> 00:47:34,380
posts that they put on there from

829
00:47:34,740 --> 00:47:36,220
today actually

830
00:47:36,220 --> 00:47:37,740
November 13th

831
00:47:37,740 --> 00:47:44,100
So that's kind of interesting. I personally didn't get to play Ocarina of Time, even though I had the disc for the Gamecube, you know the

832
00:47:44,780 --> 00:47:48,940
Here's the weird thing. I I understand the Ocarina of Time is a

833
00:47:49,780 --> 00:47:52,100
treasured game that you know when you ask people

834
00:47:52,100 --> 00:47:56,180
What is your favorite game of all time Ocarina of Time like almost always comes near the top of the list

835
00:47:56,180 --> 00:48:02,620
I did not get as into this Zelda as I and I I'm in some category by myself sometimes

836
00:48:02,620 --> 00:48:04,160
I feel like I did not get into it

837
00:48:04,160 --> 00:48:08,860
and I don't know if it's the 3d thing that really just threw me that I never was able to get over but I

838
00:48:09,460 --> 00:48:12,280
Just keep going back to the Super Nintendo Zelda

839
00:48:12,280 --> 00:48:18,600
You know and how freaking wonderful that game was linked to the past and just to me nothing compares to that

840
00:48:18,600 --> 00:48:22,520
I don't even know if this new Zelda will compare to link link to the past to me, but

841
00:48:23,040 --> 00:48:25,040
at the same time the new

842
00:48:25,040 --> 00:48:28,880
Zelda looks very, very sexy, so maybe all will be forgiven, but we'll see.

843
00:48:28,880 --> 00:48:32,160
It'll be interesting. Anything else, Loki?

844
00:48:32,160 --> 00:48:36,200
Yeah, a couple more things. First, of course, the game I've been

845
00:48:36,200 --> 00:48:40,080
watching closely, Project Gotham Raised in 3, I actually watched, they had this

846
00:48:40,080 --> 00:48:42,320
twenty-five minute video discussing, like, all the

847
00:48:42,320 --> 00:48:45,880
details that went into the graphics, the physics, and everything, and the game looks

848
00:48:45,880 --> 00:48:46,500
amazing.

849
00:48:46,500 --> 00:48:50,320
But, apparently, it might not truly be high def.

850
00:48:50,320 --> 00:48:54,040
Big freaking whoop. But, apparently,

851
00:48:54,040 --> 00:49:02,040
There was a test version of the game that was shipped out to a reviewer and they actually did a screen cap of it straight from the machine.

852
00:49:03,040 --> 00:49:05,040
Anyways, dumping the graphic buffer or something like that.

853
00:49:05,040 --> 00:49:11,040
And it's 1024x600 instead of 1024x720. Big friggin' whoop.

854
00:49:11,040 --> 00:49:14,040
So it's not the exact same detail.

855
00:49:14,040 --> 00:49:20,040
The game looks amazing though, but of course there's controversy with the whole system launching soon.

856
00:49:20,040 --> 00:49:24,040
Is it not really high def? Ooh, are they lying? Yeah, whatever.

857
00:49:24,040 --> 00:49:28,040
Do the first generation games ever push the limits of the system? No.

858
00:49:28,040 --> 00:49:31,040
Not a shock.

859
00:49:31,040 --> 00:49:35,040
In other news, Marvel has signed, or actually I should say,

860
00:49:35,040 --> 00:49:39,040
Activision has signed a deal with Marvel extending their partnership

861
00:49:39,040 --> 00:49:42,040
for another 12 years or so.

862
00:49:42,040 --> 00:49:46,040
Basically allowing them to make games until 2017

863
00:49:46,040 --> 00:49:50,840
using the licenses of Marvel and it's going to be exclusive with them so you'll see

864
00:49:50,840 --> 00:49:55,000
wonderful games such as more Spider-Man and more X-Men games coming out. Not to

865
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:59,240
say that they don't do bad games because the Ultimate Spider-Man... I heard very

866
00:49:59,240 --> 00:50:05,240
good things about that Spider-Man game, I didn't tell you myself. And X-Men Legends 2 was supposed to be pretty good too.

867
00:50:05,240 --> 00:50:11,240
See, X-Men Legends 1 disappointed the hell out of me. I was not a big fan of it, but I have heard that 2 is much better, so we'll see.

868
00:50:11,240 --> 00:50:15,200
is much better because you don't have to unlock multiplayer. That was retarded.

869
00:50:15,200 --> 00:50:17,920
I remember when we got that game we were just like, oh yeah, let's play multi...

870
00:50:17,920 --> 00:50:21,160
Oh, wait, we can't.

871
00:50:21,160 --> 00:50:26,280
Uh, speaking of Activision, I just wanted to drop this out there. Quake 4 is going

872
00:50:26,280 --> 00:50:28,980
to be a 360 launch title. It is coming out in time.

873
00:50:28,980 --> 00:50:31,880
You know, and with all the news about all these games getting pushed back, I suppose it would be

874
00:50:31,880 --> 00:50:34,880
refreshing for a change if you're an Xbox 360 fan

875
00:50:34,880 --> 00:50:38,120
to hear that Quake 4 will be dropping at launch. It was going to be dropping at launch.

876
00:50:38,120 --> 00:50:41,800
that was originally the case it was supposed to be on the 21st I heard now

877
00:50:41,800 --> 00:50:45,860
it's gonna be the 18th it is the 18th I just wanted to say that it has been

878
00:50:45,860 --> 00:50:51,020
confirmed by the studio it is happening eight player support over Xbox Live just

879
00:50:51,020 --> 00:50:57,180
an FYI that's really cool and it also has been reported that doa4 is actually

880
00:50:57,180 --> 00:51:01,060
pushed back to December now see now that was that was the game I was looking

881
00:51:01,060 --> 00:51:06,800
forward to more than any other but for the now before we all jump the gun here

882
00:51:06,800 --> 00:51:08,320
It was only pushed back a week.

883
00:51:08,320 --> 00:51:09,320
It's December 1st.

884
00:51:09,320 --> 00:51:10,320
Oh, okay.

885
00:51:10,320 --> 00:51:11,320
That's not a big deal.

886
00:51:11,320 --> 00:51:12,320
Big whoop.

887
00:51:12,320 --> 00:51:13,880
I mean, it's like, oh no, I've got to wait seven days.

888
00:51:13,880 --> 00:51:14,880
That's not such a big deal.

889
00:51:14,880 --> 00:51:18,200
But again, another reason why I do not need to be waiting out at line at six o'clock in

890
00:51:18,200 --> 00:51:21,240
the morning on next Tuesday.

891
00:51:21,240 --> 00:51:25,720
So I mean, and I've heard actually, I've heard other things seeing that it was, they're dropping

892
00:51:25,720 --> 00:51:29,640
it on the 18th also, which was very strange.

893
00:51:29,640 --> 00:51:34,040
I've been hearing mixed rumors on that, but I guess we'll find out in a few weeks, like

894
00:51:34,040 --> 00:51:35,040
next week.

895
00:51:35,040 --> 00:51:36,340
I mean, one's going to be coming out.

896
00:51:36,340 --> 00:51:39,940
So, big deal. There's tons of stuff, and I can wait seven days for a game. I mean, you're

897
00:51:39,940 --> 00:51:43,340
gonna be picking up launch games anyways. You don't need to have six games at launch.

898
00:51:43,340 --> 00:51:47,980
Well, I do, but, you know, that's just me, so...

899
00:51:47,980 --> 00:51:51,140
I'll still be playing Mario Kart DS for the next three weeks, hopefully.

900
00:51:51,140 --> 00:51:56,860
Oh, hell yes. I have to dominate the rankings for that.

901
00:51:56,860 --> 00:52:01,740
Good luck. Good luck. There are some sick, sick, sick Nintendo fanboys that will beat

902
00:52:01,740 --> 00:52:06,020
you up really bad online, and some of them are probably listening and can't wait to kick

903
00:52:06,020 --> 00:52:11,660
your ass that's perfectly fine it's on anything else I've only got one last

904
00:52:11,660 --> 00:52:16,100
story so Loki it's up to you you know I really don't have too much else other

905
00:52:16,100 --> 00:52:22,540
than yeah it's been all week long has been just stupid drama with you know the

906
00:52:22,540 --> 00:52:27,700
360 launch and that's basically been it it's been you know the whole rumors oh

907
00:52:27,700 --> 00:52:34,460
you know why why are they short shipping us why is this and that so all will be

908
00:52:34,460 --> 00:52:38,660
answered very soon it's still gonna be all drama this entire week is you know

909
00:52:38,660 --> 00:52:44,180
basically it but um yeah that's that's pretty much what I've got you know just

910
00:52:44,180 --> 00:52:49,180
that stuff quake 3 for the pocket PC you know but who owns a pocket PC you know

911
00:52:49,180 --> 00:52:53,700
compliance so who really wants to play quake 3 on a pocket PC anyway so well

912
00:52:53,700 --> 00:52:58,700
who wants to run Linux on a DS but they do it anyway so okay it does make

913
00:52:58,700 --> 00:53:04,380
homebrew and in the story of you know it's really been a slow news week

914
00:53:04,380 --> 00:53:08,940
People have been reporting on numerous websites when you pop in cameo in your Xbox

915
00:53:08,940 --> 00:53:13,540
It says put in Xbox 360 dumbass, you know, not really but you know

916
00:53:13,620 --> 00:53:15,820
It basically says this has been to be played on it

917
00:53:15,820 --> 00:53:21,020
So that's what people do with their games that they buy before the console is out. I wondered why people did that

918
00:53:21,140 --> 00:53:27,700
Okay, always answered. Thank you all other things, you know from you know instruction manuals being online for the 360

919
00:53:27,700 --> 00:53:34,060
I mean people are just dying to get anything, you know, I'm sick of the hype. I'm sorry

920
00:53:34,060 --> 00:53:37,500
I'm not trying to be anti Xbox here, but I am sick of the hype

921
00:53:37,780 --> 00:53:41,240
You know if you want the damn system or not by now have fun if you do

922
00:53:41,660 --> 00:53:45,780
Have fun waiting if you don't or whatever. I'm just yeah, I'm done. I

923
00:53:46,660 --> 00:53:51,140
Got one more story good one last story for tonight. This is really last story

924
00:53:51,140 --> 00:53:53,300
You're gonna surprise me with something else here. Loki possibly

925
00:53:54,180 --> 00:53:56,180
alright

926
00:53:56,180 --> 00:54:03,260
Keita Takahashi, who created Katamari Damacy and the sequel, gave an interview with the

927
00:54:03,260 --> 00:54:09,020
BBC this week and said that he probably doesn't really want to be doing gaming for the rest

928
00:54:09,020 --> 00:54:10,020
of his life.

929
00:54:10,020 --> 00:54:17,080
He's actually imagining developing a playground for children, so he's not really into doing

930
00:54:17,080 --> 00:54:23,100
video games for the rest of his life, but I'm just reminded of how Kojima always says

931
00:54:23,100 --> 00:54:25,900
he's not going to do another Metal Gear Solid and then, you know, the next year.

932
00:54:25,900 --> 00:54:26,900
Oh!

933
00:54:26,900 --> 00:54:27,900
Just kidding!

934
00:54:27,900 --> 00:54:28,900
Here's another one!

935
00:54:28,900 --> 00:54:29,900
I don't know.

936
00:54:29,900 --> 00:54:34,340
I think we should be forcing him to stay on video games because I'm kind of afraid to

937
00:54:34,340 --> 00:54:38,140
see what kind of playground equipment he's going to come up with.

938
00:54:38,140 --> 00:54:43,700
God damn, I mean, we don't actually need a physical Katamari out there.

939
00:54:43,700 --> 00:54:44,700
That's scary.

940
00:54:44,700 --> 00:54:45,700
Alright.

941
00:54:45,700 --> 00:54:46,700
That's it.

942
00:54:46,700 --> 00:54:47,700
That's all from me.

943
00:54:47,700 --> 00:54:48,700
Anything else?

944
00:54:48,700 --> 00:54:49,700
Any last minute stories, Logie?

945
00:54:49,700 --> 00:54:50,700
I got nothing.

946
00:54:50,700 --> 00:54:53,180
It's going to be more of the same next week, I'm sure.

947
00:54:53,180 --> 00:54:55,780
More games, more fun, more drama.

948
00:54:55,780 --> 00:54:57,660
Can't wait.

949
00:54:57,660 --> 00:54:58,660
We got a fun month ahead.

950
00:54:58,660 --> 00:55:01,220
The next six weeks are going to be a blast because we got the holiday season.

951
00:55:01,220 --> 00:55:03,900
Oh, it's going to be insane.

952
00:55:03,900 --> 00:55:04,900
You know what?

953
00:55:04,900 --> 00:55:11,420
I actually signed on to Final Fantasy XI to update it, and that's about it.

954
00:55:11,420 --> 00:55:13,920
I looked at the date that I last played it.

955
00:55:13,920 --> 00:55:14,920
Five months ago.

956
00:55:14,920 --> 00:55:15,920
I've been paying...

957
00:55:15,920 --> 00:55:17,940
And you've been paying, let's see, five times.

958
00:55:17,940 --> 00:55:18,940
How much do you pay him on?

959
00:55:18,940 --> 00:55:19,940
$12.95 or do you have another character?

960
00:55:19,940 --> 00:55:20,940
I have another character.

961
00:55:20,940 --> 00:55:25,980
Alright, so you paid $13.99 on the $14, and you paid $70 for nothing.

962
00:55:25,980 --> 00:55:27,980
I'm sure the fiancé is very pleased.

963
00:55:27,980 --> 00:55:28,980
Whatever.

964
00:55:28,980 --> 00:55:30,980
You know, I really don't care.

965
00:55:30,980 --> 00:55:32,060
I will play.

966
00:55:32,060 --> 00:55:34,540
I will play by the end of this month.

967
00:55:34,540 --> 00:55:35,540
Mark my words.

968
00:55:35,540 --> 00:55:40,060
I'll play World of Warcraft yesterday.

969
00:55:40,060 --> 00:55:41,060
I just don't have time.

970
00:55:41,060 --> 00:55:44,780
I gotta play, I have like certain games I have to play during the week, I have to play

971
00:55:44,780 --> 00:55:45,780
like everything comes out.

972
00:55:45,780 --> 00:55:46,960
No, you poor thing.

973
00:55:46,960 --> 00:55:47,960
Having to play video games.

974
00:55:47,960 --> 00:55:51,360
I have Ninja Turtles, and I haven't played that yet.

975
00:55:51,360 --> 00:55:54,200
Well, maybe we'll hear a review on that next week.

976
00:55:54,200 --> 00:55:56,440
For now, that's the show, we're pushing an hour, we're done.

977
00:55:56,440 --> 00:56:00,680
That's it for tonight's show. Next week, we'll have Minnie head on the show, we're gonna ask him questions, it'll be a good time.

978
00:56:00,680 --> 00:56:03,460
Final thoughts, Loki?

979
00:56:03,460 --> 00:56:07,700
I hope Mario Kart DS is gonna friggin' rock.

980
00:56:07,700 --> 00:56:11,620
You know, that's my exact same final thought is, Mario Kart DS, please,

981
00:56:11,620 --> 00:56:12,880
dear Nintendo, please

982
00:56:12,880 --> 00:56:15,520
do not screw up your online

983
00:56:15,520 --> 00:56:19,240
capabilities. But I have faith it's going to work. I think it's going to be an exciting

984
00:56:19,240 --> 00:56:20,440
era for the DS.

985
00:56:20,440 --> 00:56:23,720
And Animal Crossing DS in a few weeks after that.

986
00:56:23,720 --> 00:56:27,720
