00:00:00,129 --> 00:00:02,911
[SPEAKER_02]: Orange Lounge Radio To Go Edition, week of November 14th, 2005.

2
00:00:03,231 --> 00:00:13,638
[SPEAKER_00]: You're tuned in to the Orange Lounge Radio To Go Edition, your podcast home for all the latest video game news and gamer chat.

3
00:00:13,918 --> 00:00:17,421
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, here are your hosts, DarkSakura, Sky, and Loki.

4
00:00:18,942 --> 00:00:21,403
[SPEAKER_02]: Hello everybody, once again.

5
00:00:21,864 --> 00:00:25,406
[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome to another episode of Orange Lounge Radio To Go Edition.

6
00:00:25,885 --> 00:00:30,107
[SPEAKER_02]: You're home from the latest gaming news about video games that don't suck.

7
00:00:30,667 --> 00:00:31,888
[SPEAKER_02]: All the news you really want to know about.

8
00:00:32,428 --> 00:00:34,970
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, once in a while, though, we do have to talk about games that do suck.

9
00:00:35,510 --> 00:00:37,371
[SPEAKER_02]: But just to remind you to avoid them.

10
00:00:37,911 --> 00:00:38,731
[SPEAKER_02]: My name is Rob Roberts.

11
00:00:38,751 --> 00:00:39,712
[SPEAKER_02]: You might know me as Sky.

12
00:00:39,892 --> 00:00:42,773
[SPEAKER_02]: Joining me tonight, the one and only Techmaster Loki.

13
00:00:43,314 --> 00:00:44,114
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep, it's me.

14
00:00:44,414 --> 00:00:44,894
[SPEAKER_02]: How you doing?

15
00:00:45,495 --> 00:00:45,955
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm doing good.

16
00:00:46,488 --> 00:00:54,451
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, and DarkSakura, as we mentioned last week, she's been representing us at the Podcast Awards this weekend, so she is not able to be here with us tonight.

17
00:00:54,751 --> 00:01:01,094
[SPEAKER_02]: She'll be back next week for sure, but she did pass along a special message for everyone, and we'll be reading that a little bit later.

18
00:01:01,674 --> 00:01:14,999
[SPEAKER_02]: But we're going to start off tonight's show, and usually we start off with a little bit of How Was Your Gaming Week, but I want to change that a little bit tonight because I want to get this off my chest because I've kind of been thinking about this quite a bit this week, and I think I've decided that

19
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:18,402
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want to get an Xbox 360 on launch day anymore.

20
00:01:18,662 --> 00:01:28,408
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, I was all hyped up about getting the Xbox 360 the day it was coming out on launch day, and I was ready to fight those lines at Best Buy and Target or wherever I decided to end up going.

21
00:01:28,448 --> 00:01:30,190
[SPEAKER_02]: Toys R Us, which I think will probably be one of the best places.

22
00:01:30,330 --> 00:01:30,810
[SPEAKER_02]: Now I'm just like...

23
00:01:31,510 --> 00:01:37,054
[SPEAKER_02]: After reading about all these horrible, horrible delays and reading about... Now, Loki, didn't your system get delayed, in fact?

24
00:01:37,474 --> 00:01:38,454
[SPEAKER_02]: You were supposed to get one.

25
00:01:38,494 --> 00:01:39,255
[SPEAKER_02]: You reserved it months ago.

26
00:01:39,375 --> 00:01:40,976
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, but I have my theories on this, too.

27
00:01:41,456 --> 00:01:41,756
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah.

28
00:01:41,776 --> 00:01:42,437
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you think?

29
00:01:42,877 --> 00:01:43,517
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's my theory.

30
00:01:43,537 --> 00:01:44,978
[SPEAKER_02]: Before I continue to rant.

31
00:01:45,018 --> 00:01:48,000
[SPEAKER_01]: My theory is that they're not going to be as shorthanded as they think they are.

32
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:52,402
[SPEAKER_01]: I think Microsoft purposefully told them they're getting less than they actually are.

33
00:01:52,803 --> 00:01:55,264
[SPEAKER_01]: So, okay, you pre-ordered 200 for your store.

34
00:01:55,796 --> 00:01:57,678
[SPEAKER_01]: They said, oh, well, you're only going to get 50.

35
00:01:57,939 --> 00:01:59,901
[SPEAKER_01]: They actually ship you 100 or something like that.

36
00:02:00,261 --> 00:02:04,406
[SPEAKER_01]: So those people that thought that they weren't going to get them, they got lucky and they got some.

37
00:02:04,787 --> 00:02:11,535
[SPEAKER_01]: So Microsoft looks like the hero now, but still they're still cutting them short and they still sell out and there's still the media hype about it.

38
00:02:11,892 --> 00:02:18,157
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it's backfiring because I was interested, but after hearing about all the shortages, I'm like, do I really want to deal with this crap?

39
00:02:18,557 --> 00:02:21,439
[SPEAKER_02]: Do I really want the system that badly at launch?

40
00:02:21,459 --> 00:02:26,583
[SPEAKER_02]: And it kind of made me reevaluate what games are coming out at launch and after playing the kiosk and stuff.

41
00:02:26,623 --> 00:02:29,585
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm not being anti-Microsoft with this statement.

42
00:02:29,665 --> 00:02:34,749
[SPEAKER_02]: I will get an Xbox 360 eventually, but I'm just going, do I really want to buy into this launch hype?

43
00:02:34,789 --> 00:02:37,531
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there any game that's coming out on launch day I really, really want?

44
00:02:37,551 --> 00:02:38,912
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm thinking to myself, you know what?

45
00:02:39,452 --> 00:02:40,753
[SPEAKER_02]: No, there isn't.

46
00:02:41,013 --> 00:02:41,853
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I can wait.

47
00:02:41,973 --> 00:02:43,634
[SPEAKER_02]: I can wait until January or later.

48
00:02:43,934 --> 00:02:46,996
[SPEAKER_02]: And come to think of it, there's very few systems that I bought on launch.

49
00:02:47,316 --> 00:02:52,418
[SPEAKER_02]: The last one was the Nintendo DS, but before that, I can't really think of what system I probably bought on launch day.

50
00:02:52,859 --> 00:02:54,119
[SPEAKER_02]: So, it can wait.

51
00:02:54,660 --> 00:02:57,121
[SPEAKER_02]: But I know I've been kind of going back and forth on that for a while, so who knows.

52
00:02:57,161 --> 00:02:59,182
[SPEAKER_02]: I reserve the right to change my mind before...

53
00:02:59,662 --> 00:03:02,184
[SPEAKER_02]: Before the official D-Day in what, like nine days or so?

54
00:03:02,204 --> 00:03:03,145
[SPEAKER_02]: Something like that, yeah.

55
00:03:03,165 --> 00:03:07,989
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it depends on what day you're listening to this podcast, but, you know, we're very little time left.

56
00:03:08,310 --> 00:03:16,937
[SPEAKER_02]: But I'm just like, you know what, for all that money, especially if they're going to be pushing me to buy, you know, two games out the door and everything, and all this, you know, all this other accessory crap, I'm just like, you know what, man?

57
00:03:16,957 --> 00:03:19,159
[SPEAKER_01]: They may be pushing you, but they're not going to require it.

58
00:03:19,319 --> 00:03:20,360
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know...

59
00:03:21,221 --> 00:03:45,414
[SPEAKER_01]: I have my own qualms with I've read about how they're going to be doing this whole thing at Best Buy and how they like want you to buy all this stuff and they're hoping they spend $600 at their store well the hell with them I had the remember those free Best Buy bucks they had the money for from McDonald's and all that wonderful stuff well I like about $31 of this stuff so I was going to go buy a shot of Colossus there and just say hey okay cool I get the game for like three bucks or whatever

60
00:03:46,599 --> 00:03:46,999
[SPEAKER_01]: No!

61
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:51,123
[SPEAKER_01]: You can only use $3 on a game, DVD, or CD.

62
00:03:51,183 --> 00:03:52,444
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, where does it say that on this?

63
00:03:52,804 --> 00:03:54,025
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it doesn't say on this.

64
00:03:55,026 --> 00:03:56,167
[SPEAKER_01]: It's on the giant paper.

65
00:03:56,447 --> 00:03:57,928
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, what giant paper?

66
00:03:58,929 --> 00:04:00,170
[SPEAKER_01]: Do they want to see the giant paper?

67
00:04:00,210 --> 00:04:04,914
[SPEAKER_01]: It almost made me think I was going to go see The Wizard of Oz or something like that.

68
00:04:06,175 --> 00:04:07,296
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, he wants to see the giant paper?

69
00:04:07,536 --> 00:04:08,517
[SPEAKER_01]: No, not the giant paper!

70
00:04:08,797 --> 00:04:10,258
[SPEAKER_01]: No one has to see the giant paper!

71
00:04:10,598 --> 00:04:10,899
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like...

72
00:04:11,687 --> 00:04:12,127
[SPEAKER_01]: What the hell?

73
00:04:12,187 --> 00:04:18,870
[SPEAKER_01]: So I basically went and got a spool of blank DVDs instead and I'm all, is this good enough for ya?

74
00:04:18,890 --> 00:04:20,031
[SPEAKER_01]: No, that's fine.

75
00:04:20,091 --> 00:04:21,451
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, shit, god.

76
00:04:22,212 --> 00:04:23,953
[SPEAKER_01]: Then I went and spent my money elsewhere.

77
00:04:25,033 --> 00:04:26,294
[SPEAKER_01]: But I did pick up shallow classes.

78
00:04:27,247 --> 00:04:28,428
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, don't derail my Xbox 360, dog.

79
00:04:28,448 --> 00:04:29,428
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry, sorry.

80
00:04:29,468 --> 00:04:36,952
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I know, that's probably what every gaming podcast is going to talk about this week is Xbox 360, but I'm going to say I'm probably not going to buy it.

81
00:04:37,232 --> 00:04:45,596
[SPEAKER_02]: I've pretty much decided in my mind that my money is better spent on current Xbox, PlayStation 2, and GameCube games, and the 360 thing can wait until January.

82
00:04:46,597 --> 00:04:49,944
[SPEAKER_01]: I have tons of games pre-ordered.

83
00:04:49,964 --> 00:04:55,755
[SPEAKER_01]: I have four games pre-ordered right now with a possible fifth being pre-ordered later this week because I have store credit.

84
00:04:57,529 --> 00:04:58,470
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm gonna be getting the games.

85
00:04:58,650 --> 00:05:05,838
[SPEAKER_01]: In the system, I have a feeling I'm not gonna be waiting that much longer, even if it is not launch day, which I still think it probably is gonna be launch day.

86
00:05:06,558 --> 00:05:09,942
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm still gonna get one probably pretty soon, you know, whenever they decide to ship more.

87
00:05:10,302 --> 00:05:14,527
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm not really that concerned about, you know, not being, you know, there.

88
00:05:14,927 --> 00:05:17,289
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't wanna wait in line, you know, in the morning and stuff.

89
00:05:17,329 --> 00:05:17,770
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what?

90
00:05:18,210 --> 00:05:18,471
[SPEAKER_02]: If I...

91
00:05:20,075 --> 00:05:27,677
[SPEAKER_02]: I let some kid who really wants the Xbox 360 for some game they've got to freaking have on the day when, you know what, I'm being nice.

92
00:05:27,877 --> 00:05:32,759
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm stepping aside because you don't want to see me with my claws out in the line waiting to get one of these systems.

93
00:05:32,779 --> 00:05:33,539
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm being nice.

94
00:05:33,899 --> 00:05:34,700
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm stepping aside.

95
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:38,301
[SPEAKER_02]: I will wait so one of you more eager kids can go get your Xbox.

96
00:05:38,341 --> 00:05:39,461
[SPEAKER_02]: See, I'm doing a nice thing here.

97
00:05:39,681 --> 00:05:44,163
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, what GameStop told me is I have their pre-ordered mine back in May in order to get one.

98
00:05:44,203 --> 00:05:45,283
[SPEAKER_01]: That's before...

99
00:05:45,703 --> 00:05:45,983
[SPEAKER_01]: and so on.

100
00:06:06,872 --> 00:06:08,073
[SPEAKER_02]: I do want to mention this before.

101
00:06:08,093 --> 00:06:13,614
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, this is a little bit of a news story, but it's kind of some late-breaking news that's coming in as we are taping, as we tape on Sunday nights.

102
00:06:14,154 --> 00:06:15,815
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're getting this story.

103
00:06:15,875 --> 00:06:18,615
[SPEAKER_02]: It's actually coming off of JoystickWithACue.com.

104
00:06:19,175 --> 00:06:21,836
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're saying that Circuit City is advertising on their website.

105
00:06:21,856 --> 00:06:28,378
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can actually see this on their website, CircuitCity.com, that they will be selling 360s on Friday at 2 p.m.

106
00:06:28,518 --> 00:06:29,478
[SPEAKER_02]: Eastern Standard Time.

107
00:06:29,918 --> 00:06:32,599
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, of course, the initial thought when you see this is, okay, whatever.

108
00:06:32,779 --> 00:06:55,484
[SPEAKER_02]: they're gonna sell it on their website and you know you order it on the website and they'll ship it to you by Tuesday or something right so it's not like they're really breaking the launch day but the weird thing is that this article says they actually called the customer service line and they spoke to a customer service rep and they're saying that every physical Circuit City location will be selling the console this Friday at 2 p.m.

109
00:06:55,544 --> 00:06:58,045
[SPEAKER_02]: Eastern and just to be sure they called back

110
00:06:58,942 --> 00:07:02,444
[SPEAKER_02]: and Double Checked just to make sure that they indeed were selling this.

111
00:07:02,484 --> 00:07:05,485
[SPEAKER_02]: And they said, yes, it will be available this Friday at 2 p.m.

112
00:07:06,025 --> 00:07:08,506
[SPEAKER_02]: Eastern Time online as well as at our stores.

113
00:07:08,886 --> 00:07:20,372
[SPEAKER_02]: So our thought was we'll call our local Circuit City and check, but unfortunately since we taped Sunday night and it's about 8.40 now, we missed the boat because they close at 8, so we didn't get a chance to call.

114
00:07:20,672 --> 00:07:22,333
[SPEAKER_02]: Did people still shop at Circuit City?

115
00:07:23,453 --> 00:07:24,513
[SPEAKER_02]: I bought my video card there.

116
00:07:24,554 --> 00:07:27,575
[SPEAKER_02]: There's still a fine store, you know.

117
00:07:28,206 --> 00:07:30,528
[SPEAKER_01]: Last thing I bought at Circuit City was your GameCube

118
00:07:55,748 --> 00:08:07,251
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know, I have a feeling this might change by Monday, Tuesday when you guys are actually hearing this podcast, but this is something that's late-breaking, so keep an eye on CircuitCity.com if you want to try and beat the rush, so to speak.

119
00:08:07,331 --> 00:08:15,354
[SPEAKER_02]: Although, you know, with every gaming site reporting this, who knows, everybody and their sister is probably going to be lining up to get an Xbox 360 on Friday from Circuit City.

120
00:08:15,514 --> 00:08:19,035
[SPEAKER_02]: That's going to be a lot of interesting phone calls, if it isn't true.

121
00:08:20,086 --> 00:08:25,648
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, let's do a little bit of how is your gaming week, what games you've been playing this week, and what you're up to.

122
00:08:25,949 --> 00:08:27,589
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki, you mentioned Shadow of the Colossus?

123
00:08:28,030 --> 00:08:29,410
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, I was playing that today.

124
00:08:30,631 --> 00:08:33,492
[SPEAKER_01]: I've gotten through already six of the Colossuses, and I think

125
00:08:34,423 --> 00:08:35,803
[SPEAKER_01]: The Colossus and The Camera

126
00:09:03,689 --> 00:09:07,412
[SPEAKER_01]: Because the camera does not want to freaking focus on anything correctly.

127
00:09:07,552 --> 00:09:12,655
[SPEAKER_01]: I have to constantly, you know, control it with the right analog stick while trying to fight this thing.

128
00:09:12,715 --> 00:09:14,957
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's a button to focus in on the Colossus.

129
00:09:14,997 --> 00:09:20,101
[SPEAKER_01]: Kind of like... It reminds me of Mega Man Legends where you can target stuff.

130
00:09:20,241 --> 00:09:21,642
[SPEAKER_01]: And that works really well.

131
00:09:22,102 --> 00:09:23,583
[SPEAKER_01]: This does not work very well.

132
00:09:24,204 --> 00:09:29,267
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, I get lost quite a bit trying to figure out where the hell I'm supposed to be going in this game.

133
00:09:29,808 --> 00:09:31,429
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's really nothing else, you know...

134
00:09:32,839 --> 00:09:33,700
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for watching!

135
00:09:49,568 --> 00:09:50,929
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

136
00:10:08,356 --> 00:10:09,276
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know, it was a really fun game.

137
00:10:09,296 --> 00:10:10,997
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it sounds like it's a game you can really get into then.

138
00:10:11,137 --> 00:10:11,437
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

139
00:10:11,997 --> 00:10:13,778
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes yelling at the TV makes it a really good game.

140
00:10:13,798 --> 00:10:14,238
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I was frustrated.

141
00:10:14,258 --> 00:10:19,760
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, you know, because I'm trying to grab a hold of this one part of it, and it keeps grabbing some other part of it.

142
00:10:19,780 --> 00:10:22,721
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm like, son of a bitch, do what I want you to do.

143
00:10:23,461 --> 00:10:25,101
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, it was kind of annoying.

144
00:10:25,141 --> 00:10:29,783
[SPEAKER_01]: But then, I don't know, I'll probably play through it and be done with it, and that's it.

145
00:10:31,218 --> 00:10:31,699
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

146
00:10:44,866 --> 00:10:46,507
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm tempted to check that out.

147
00:10:46,867 --> 00:10:50,069
[SPEAKER_02]: I've not been that into Grand Theft Auto.

148
00:10:50,109 --> 00:10:57,432
[SPEAKER_02]: I understand why it does so well critically and commercially, but for me personally, it's not really my kind of game.

149
00:10:57,692 --> 00:11:01,814
[SPEAKER_02]: But I am kind of tempted to check out this PSP one, if for no other reason than I need more games for my PSP.

150
00:11:02,534 --> 00:11:03,855
[SPEAKER_01]: The multiplayer is the best part.

151
00:11:03,875 --> 00:11:04,415
[SPEAKER_01]: I love it.

152
00:11:04,975 --> 00:11:08,597
[SPEAKER_01]: This should have been something that they really had in all of them, I think.

153
00:11:09,076 --> 00:11:10,058
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for watching!

154
00:11:23,579 --> 00:11:25,560
[SPEAKER_01]: and just have it online and be able to play that way.

155
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:29,262
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it'd be really fun, and you can get some really good tournaments and stuff going along.

156
00:11:30,263 --> 00:11:39,447
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm hopefully, in the next reiteration of this, which is coming out exclusively on the PS3, we'll have something multiplayer on it, because I think it really needs it.

157
00:11:39,568 --> 00:11:41,248
[SPEAKER_01]: Or even two-player co-op would be awesome.

158
00:11:42,109 --> 00:11:42,529
[SPEAKER_02]: Good ideas.

159
00:11:43,890 --> 00:11:45,271
[SPEAKER_02]: So anything else you've been playing besides those two?

160
00:11:45,591 --> 00:11:46,011
[SPEAKER_01]: That's it.

161
00:11:46,031 --> 00:11:49,673
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got a lot of stuff lined up for this week, but that's about it.

162
00:11:49,713 --> 00:11:51,534
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got Gun and Matrix.

163
00:11:52,605 --> 00:11:52,925
[SPEAKER_02]: Sounds good.

164
00:11:52,965 --> 00:11:53,445
[SPEAKER_02]: Path of Neo.

165
00:11:53,485 --> 00:11:53,685
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

166
00:11:53,865 --> 00:11:55,066
[SPEAKER_02]: I've heard some good things about that game.

167
00:11:55,546 --> 00:11:56,026
[SPEAKER_01]: Looks good.

168
00:11:56,826 --> 00:11:58,227
[SPEAKER_01]: Then there's more stuff coming out this week.

169
00:11:58,307 --> 00:12:02,628
[SPEAKER_01]: I know, or it'll be Need for Speed Most Wanted's coming out.

170
00:12:03,168 --> 00:12:03,929
[SPEAKER_02]: I can already tell you.

171
00:12:05,029 --> 00:12:07,670
[SPEAKER_02]: Ultra Mix 3 is out this week and Mario Kart DS.

172
00:12:08,223 --> 00:12:08,984
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I'm getting DS'd.

173
00:12:32,731 --> 00:12:34,952
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh hell yes, we'll see, we'll see, I'm excited.

174
00:12:35,052 --> 00:12:39,155
[SPEAKER_02]: This is, you know, this is a very interesting week if you think about it.

175
00:12:40,916 --> 00:12:48,200
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a huge week in that, this is almost epic in that this is where Nintendo is finally embracing online.

176
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:57,585
[SPEAKER_02]: And granted, I mean, you could, you know, get me on little loopholes like, you know, okay, Phantasy Star Online for the GameCube, but let's face it, that was a Sega game.

177
00:12:57,825 --> 00:12:59,066
[SPEAKER_02]: It was established before the GameCube

178
00:13:26,423 --> 00:13:30,504
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm still waiting for their announcement on December 9th.

179
00:13:49,688 --> 00:13:50,449
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll get there in a little bit.

180
00:14:19,708 --> 00:14:20,368
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for watching!

181
00:14:38,902 --> 00:14:41,724
[SPEAKER_02]: I wish I knew about this when it was the arcades, but it was probably a small game.

182
00:14:42,084 --> 00:14:43,706
[SPEAKER_02]: So some little gems in there as well.

183
00:14:43,746 --> 00:14:48,729
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you're into the retro collection thing, a lot of good games for $20, I would recommend it for you.

184
00:14:49,270 --> 00:14:51,952
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're not into the retro collections, nothing here is going to win you over.

185
00:14:52,032 --> 00:14:56,695
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, Arcade Perfect Bubble Bobble on your console, it's pretty cool.

186
00:14:56,995 --> 00:14:58,797
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, unless you're already into the MAME thing.

187
00:14:58,817 --> 00:15:00,178
[SPEAKER_02]: But come on, support these guys a little bit.

188
00:15:00,198 --> 00:15:00,458
[SPEAKER_02]: It's $20.

189
00:15:01,399 --> 00:15:01,839
[SPEAKER_02]: Not that bad.

190
00:15:03,106 --> 00:15:06,588
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I know, that was a little short review of Tidal Legends, but what else can I really say about it?

191
00:15:06,748 --> 00:15:12,872
[SPEAKER_02]: And another game I got to check out, I went to a little party yesterday for a web forum I'm on, and got to check out some new games at this party.

192
00:15:13,273 --> 00:15:14,954
[SPEAKER_02]: Mario Party 7 being one of them.

193
00:15:15,814 --> 00:15:19,537
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't even know if I can really review Mario Party 7, I mean, what the hell can I say about it?

194
00:15:20,037 --> 00:15:25,241
[SPEAKER_02]: You've seen 4, 5, 6 on the GameCube, and 3, 2, 1 before that on the Nintendo 64.

195
00:15:26,321 --> 00:15:27,242
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it is eight players.

196
00:15:27,282 --> 00:15:33,546
[SPEAKER_02]: That was the first, because we actually played an eight-player game, and you used half the controller in the eight-player game, like you and a friend.

197
00:15:33,586 --> 00:15:35,248
[SPEAKER_02]: Hold on, so you have to get, you know, in close quarters.

198
00:15:35,608 --> 00:15:45,475
[SPEAKER_02]: But you and a friend each hold half the controller, and one of you uses the C-stick, the little yellow C-stick, and the right trigger, and then the other person uses the left analog controller and the left trigger.

199
00:15:45,795 --> 00:15:46,416
[SPEAKER_02]: So it works out.

200
00:15:46,436 --> 00:15:49,157
[SPEAKER_02]: You can do an eight-player, and you can do teams around the board.

201
00:15:49,177 --> 00:15:53,701
[SPEAKER_02]: So we even did an eight-player game around the board, and myself and Miklatov won, of

202
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:55,000
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you very much.

203
00:16:03,884 --> 00:16:06,705
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, but those guys are probably pissed off at me.

204
00:16:07,465 --> 00:16:08,805
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, no, we had a good time.

205
00:16:09,165 --> 00:16:11,206
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, honestly, I don't know what else I can say about it.

206
00:16:11,686 --> 00:16:16,147
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, if you like these kind of Mario Party games, I don't think they make very good single player games at all.

207
00:16:16,427 --> 00:16:20,148
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you're the type of person that games by yourself, I don't think there's a whole lot here for you.

208
00:16:20,308 --> 00:16:23,409
[SPEAKER_02]: Although there are single player modes, but I don't know.

209
00:16:23,489 --> 00:16:24,649
[SPEAKER_02]: And there are, you know what?

210
00:16:24,949 --> 00:16:26,169
[SPEAKER_02]: There are some pretty cool mini games.

211
00:16:26,189 --> 00:16:28,150
[SPEAKER_02]: There was a couple of cool puzzle mini games.

212
00:16:29,791 --> 00:16:32,492
[SPEAKER_02]: This one where there were these balls.

213
00:16:32,812 --> 00:16:36,875
[SPEAKER_02]: It kind of reminded me of this old-ass arcade game I used to play at Golf Land called Battle Balls.

214
00:16:37,255 --> 00:16:38,376
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you ever remember this game?

215
00:16:38,396 --> 00:16:42,178
[SPEAKER_02]: It was like a Japanese import game where it had these marbles that were falling and you had to stack them.

216
00:16:42,198 --> 00:16:42,778
[SPEAKER_02]: It was kind of like...

217
00:16:43,479 --> 00:16:43,799
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

218
00:16:43,919 --> 00:16:44,580
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't even explain.

219
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:45,600
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like a Tetris-type game.

220
00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:52,524
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, they have something like that in this, except it's a rotating sphere that you let the balls fall into.

221
00:16:52,664 --> 00:16:53,825
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's some kind of cool minigames.

222
00:16:53,845 --> 00:16:54,325
[SPEAKER_02]: So you know what?

223
00:16:55,126 --> 00:16:58,968
[SPEAKER_02]: I think there would be some cool stuff in here if you are a single player, you know, but...

224
00:16:59,788 --> 00:17:05,930
[SPEAKER_02]: To get the full potential of this game, you've got to be the type of person that has friends over a lot, or you've got a big family, so there's always somebody there to play the game with you.

225
00:17:06,310 --> 00:17:07,851
[SPEAKER_02]: I think you'd get more value out of it that way.

226
00:17:08,311 --> 00:17:11,552
[SPEAKER_02]: But it does seem to be a better Mario Party game than the last couple I played.

227
00:17:11,592 --> 00:17:18,695
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't particularly enjoy 5 or 6 as much as 4, although most other people I've talked to say that 4 is the weakest.

228
00:17:18,935 --> 00:17:22,356
[SPEAKER_02]: That wasn't my personal opinion, but 7's a pretty solid entry.

229
00:17:22,376 --> 00:17:27,218
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you've kind of been lagging on the Mario Party series, 7's a good one to come back to, and it does have the microphone support again.

230
00:17:28,039 --> 00:17:34,658
[SPEAKER_02]: Other game I checked out was Karaoke Revolution Party Which I played a little bit at E3 But I got to see the full release of the game

231
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:35,881
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

232
00:17:59,079 --> 00:18:14,474
[SPEAKER_02]: The version I played was on Xbox, and you can actually use your Xbox Live headset as a microphone, but the game also has a bundle that comes with a holding microphone if you want, but it actually gauges your pitch as a little arrow, so you can see exactly if you're tone deaf, the game will tell you honestly how you're doing.

233
00:18:16,596 --> 00:18:17,457
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's kind of how it works.

234
00:18:17,477 --> 00:18:21,521
[SPEAKER_02]: So I could see maybe a little bit of single player value and that you want to be a better singer, but

235
00:18:21,977 --> 00:18:33,325
[SPEAKER_02]: This is really more the kind of thing where, you know, again, if you have people around a lot, you're an entertainer type with your video games, you'd probably get a lot of value out of Karaoke Revolution Party because I'll tell you, at this party, it was a hit.

236
00:18:33,825 --> 00:18:39,809
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody got on there and was doing the random medley because you can do little medleys of five songs and just do random.

237
00:18:40,089 --> 00:18:41,290
[SPEAKER_02]: So random songs would come up.

238
00:18:41,870 --> 00:18:46,313
[SPEAKER_02]: And the interesting thing about Karaoke Revolution Party is that the song list is very eclectic.

239
00:18:46,653 --> 00:18:50,416
[SPEAKER_02]: There really is something for everyone, which is a strong point and a weak point

240
00:18:51,997 --> 00:18:59,701
[SPEAKER_02]: The fact that there's something for everyone means that you really only really, really like like five or six songs on the list and then the rest you're kind of like, oh, I know that song.

241
00:18:59,781 --> 00:19:00,461
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I know that song.

242
00:19:00,901 --> 00:19:03,103
[SPEAKER_02]: It didn't really focus on one genre.

243
00:19:03,643 --> 00:19:08,745
[SPEAKER_02]: What I think is interesting about the Xbox version is that you can expand the song list via Xbox Live.

244
00:19:09,046 --> 00:19:20,051
[SPEAKER_02]: There are 100 songs available on Xbox Live for download and you can either download a block of five songs in a genre for $5 each or you can download the whole shebang, all 100 songs for $80.

245
00:19:22,148 --> 00:19:22,768
[SPEAKER_01]: Holy crap.

246
00:19:22,788 --> 00:19:23,589
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know who'd want to spend $80.

247
00:19:23,729 --> 00:19:25,770
[SPEAKER_01]: That's really good.

248
00:19:25,870 --> 00:19:37,938
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I mean, there's a lot of expansiveness to this game, so certainly the song list will not grow stale, but you're going to have to spend $80, maybe $100 to really expand it.

249
00:19:38,278 --> 00:19:44,262
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, if you're willing to spend $5 here, $5 there, you can at least buy the genres, because at least it breaks it out into genres.

250
00:19:44,282 --> 00:19:49,306
[SPEAKER_02]: You could buy, like, okay, if I want to buy all the rock packs, that would be like $10, you know, if you're more of a rock music fan.

251
00:19:49,326 --> 00:19:49,666
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's

252
00:19:50,206 --> 00:19:51,687
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, that's cool.

253
00:19:52,487 --> 00:19:54,048
[SPEAKER_02]: I would recommend Karaoke Revolution.

254
00:19:55,468 --> 00:19:58,189
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, this is one of those games where you already know if this game is for you.

255
00:19:58,489 --> 00:20:04,031
[SPEAKER_02]: It is definitely the strongest Karaoke Revolution title to date because there's been three other volumes released.

256
00:20:04,071 --> 00:20:12,435
[SPEAKER_02]: This one has Create a Character, this one has the Sing and Dance mode, and both of those just really add to what was already a really unique game.

257
00:20:12,495 --> 00:20:15,076
[SPEAKER_02]: So, definitely the strongest entry in the series so far.

258
00:20:15,156 --> 00:20:16,836
[SPEAKER_02]: Check it out if you're a fan of the music games.

259
00:20:17,837 --> 00:20:18,077
[SPEAKER_02]: And so,

260
00:20:18,561 --> 00:20:19,522
[SPEAKER_02]: XBOX 360 Dominating the News

261
00:20:40,442 --> 00:21:08,435
[SPEAKER_02]: Compatibility list finally released over at Xbox.com Exactly which games they will be backwards compatible supporting And yes, it is apparently going to be using an emulator type thing Because only about 200 titles or so are emulatable Well, so far So far, and they say they are going to expand to it But you do notice a couple things that are missing right off the bat Such as Dance Dance Revolution Ultra Mix Some of the other things such as I noticed Midway Arcade Treasures wasn't on there

262
00:21:09,266 --> 00:21:10,807
[SPEAKER_02]: and some of the other, like, older Xbox titles.

263
00:21:10,827 --> 00:21:14,350
[SPEAKER_01]: There's some weird stuff on that list, that's all I gotta say.

264
00:21:14,430 --> 00:21:31,543
[SPEAKER_02]: But most, you know what, and I know a lot of people are saying this, like, why is Barbie on the list and, you know, these Aliens vs. Predator and some of these games that weren't standards, you know, and you have this alongside Halo 2, Halo, Fable, you know, all the games...

265
00:21:32,464 --> 00:21:37,046
[SPEAKER_02]: Ninja Gaiden, and all the games you would expect Xbox 360 to be emulating.

266
00:21:38,686 --> 00:21:46,109
[SPEAKER_02]: My thought is, is like, if you are familiar with emulating of games at all, like, for instance, take Nintendo emulation.

267
00:21:46,529 --> 00:21:47,229
[SPEAKER_02]: There's like

268
00:21:48,659 --> 00:21:49,620
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for watching!

269
00:22:04,133 --> 00:22:04,954
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

270
00:22:20,030 --> 00:22:23,374
[SPEAKER_02]: A game like Ultramix or something will probably take a little more effort.

271
00:22:23,434 --> 00:22:24,135
[SPEAKER_02]: That's my thought.

272
00:22:24,475 --> 00:22:32,603
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's why I'm not freaking out about the stuff that they picked to be on this list because obviously they went for their standards and they just haven't gotten around to the rest of it yet.

273
00:22:32,984 --> 00:22:42,373
[SPEAKER_02]: But another question was answered and that was if I bought premium content on the Xbox will I be able to transfer it over to the Xbox 360?

274
00:22:43,706 --> 00:22:46,188
[SPEAKER_02]: No, you will not be able to transfer it to the Xbox 360.

275
00:22:46,488 --> 00:22:55,093
[SPEAKER_02]: So don't shelve your Xbox console or sell it back just yet if you use your premium content that's on there because you will have to rebuy it on Xbox 360.

276
00:22:55,394 --> 00:22:57,115
[SPEAKER_02]: At least that's what we're hearing right now.

277
00:22:57,595 --> 00:22:58,075
[SPEAKER_01]: So far.

278
00:22:58,356 --> 00:23:02,318
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, that might change later if they figure out a way to do certain things.

279
00:23:03,439 --> 00:23:04,319
[SPEAKER_01]: I somehow don't think it will.

280
00:23:04,700 --> 00:23:09,703
[SPEAKER_01]: Although, if you are a dance game fan, I did see on the list, Pump It Up, Exceed was on there, so...

281
00:23:10,302 --> 00:23:12,582
[SPEAKER_01]: That is one game you'll at least be able to play.

282
00:23:13,303 --> 00:23:18,164
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't think that was Microsoft saying we prefer Pump It Up to DDR or any of that crap.

283
00:23:18,184 --> 00:23:21,024
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's just, again, you get one game to work and Pump It Up worked as well.

284
00:23:21,064 --> 00:23:21,764
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's the problem, though.

285
00:23:21,784 --> 00:23:23,285
[SPEAKER_02]: How are you going to plug in the dance pad?

286
00:23:24,285 --> 00:23:24,545
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh!

287
00:23:24,565 --> 00:23:26,325
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, good thought, good thought.

288
00:23:26,385 --> 00:23:27,846
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it not the same controller ports?

289
00:23:28,066 --> 00:23:29,566
[SPEAKER_02]: I assumed it was the same controller ports.

290
00:23:29,626 --> 00:23:32,206
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't really research some of these things.

291
00:23:32,506 --> 00:23:33,687
[SPEAKER_02]: There are no controller ports.

292
00:23:34,567 --> 00:23:36,947
[SPEAKER_02]: What about... No, there's a wired controller that you get in one pack.

293
00:23:38,248 --> 00:23:39,108
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, duh.

294
00:23:39,488 --> 00:23:39,868
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, I'm...

295
00:23:40,413 --> 00:23:42,334
[SPEAKER_02]: That makes too much sense for my feeble brain.

296
00:23:42,614 --> 00:23:50,956
[SPEAKER_01]: No, what they could do is a USB adapter, since the actual Xbox controllers are modified USB.

297
00:23:50,996 --> 00:23:54,757
[SPEAKER_02]: There's probably already an Xbox to USB, so people could use those things on their computer.

298
00:23:55,538 --> 00:23:57,978
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure, though, the game would recognize, and that's a problem.

299
00:23:58,939 --> 00:24:00,359
[SPEAKER_01]: But, I don't know.

300
00:24:00,579 --> 00:24:03,800
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure this stuff will come out later, but at least it's available.

301
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:04,720
[SPEAKER_01]: You can play it on the controller.

302
00:24:05,141 --> 00:24:05,501
[SPEAKER_02]: Woohoo.

303
00:24:07,588 --> 00:24:09,390
[SPEAKER_02]: Beatmania USA February 8th That's what Konami sent over to us so far.

304
00:24:33,214 --> 00:24:37,276
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, you know, with the dates shuffling like crazy, that could move.

305
00:24:37,477 --> 00:24:41,379
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's what they've given us so far, and we actually have a solid date for it.

306
00:24:41,839 --> 00:24:43,580
[SPEAKER_01]: So, who knows?

307
00:24:44,401 --> 00:24:46,262
[SPEAKER_02]: But Tentative should be pretty cool.

308
00:24:46,422 --> 00:24:55,467
[SPEAKER_02]: And speaking of Beatmania, if you are the type that imports your Beatmania from Japan, like I did for a long time, Tentstyle is on its way out very, very soon.

309
00:24:55,527 --> 00:24:57,548
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's next week as well.

310
00:24:58,829 --> 00:25:01,871
[SPEAKER_02]: Tentstyle has the song list up, and

311
00:25:02,151 --> 00:25:04,653
[SPEAKER_02]: What's very interesting is that there's a very interesting crossover in it.

312
00:25:05,473 --> 00:25:16,479
[SPEAKER_02]: Jelly Kiss, MidiHead's smack mix from Ultramix 3 is crossing over into 2DX10 style, which is interesting because if you follow the music gaming forums, people have been saying that MidiHead needs to be in 2DX for a long, long time.

313
00:25:17,500 --> 00:25:18,941
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know the other footnote I have to this?

314
00:25:19,841 --> 00:25:20,001
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

315
00:25:20,141 --> 00:25:21,522
[SPEAKER_02]: MidiHead's going to be on the show next week.

316
00:25:21,542 --> 00:25:25,044
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to have an interview with him, so I'm going to ask him exactly what he thinks about this.

317
00:25:25,104 --> 00:25:26,185
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll have MidiHead on next week's show.

318
00:25:29,095 --> 00:25:31,156
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see, what else is going on here in the gaming world?

319
00:25:31,216 --> 00:25:35,437
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's talk about this, because this made me squee like a little fanboy.

320
00:25:35,537 --> 00:25:36,557
[SPEAKER_02]: It was beautiful.

321
00:25:36,797 --> 00:25:38,098
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I shed a tear over this.

322
00:25:38,538 --> 00:25:39,998
[SPEAKER_02]: I forgave Squeenix over this.

323
00:25:40,799 --> 00:25:42,299
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to sound like such a nerd, but I don't care.

324
00:25:42,699 --> 00:25:43,319
[SPEAKER_02]: Kingdom Hearts 2.

325
00:25:44,140 --> 00:25:46,720
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you see those pictures coming out of Famitsu Magazine?

326
00:25:47,020 --> 00:25:48,221
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry, not Famitsu.

327
00:25:48,341 --> 00:25:48,721
[SPEAKER_02]: Just kidding.

328
00:25:49,161 --> 00:25:52,142
[SPEAKER_02]: Jump Magazine was the magazine that released this.

329
00:25:53,322 --> 00:25:55,883
[SPEAKER_02]: Kingdom Hearts 2 characters in Tron outfits.

330
00:25:57,057 --> 00:25:57,457
[SPEAKER_02]: Awesome.

331
00:25:57,757 --> 00:26:00,459
[SPEAKER_02]: Meaning that Tron is a level in Kingdom Hearts 2?

332
00:26:01,179 --> 00:26:02,400
[SPEAKER_02]: I forgive them for the delay.

333
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:03,461
[SPEAKER_01]: They show stuff from Tron.

334
00:26:03,481 --> 00:26:04,521
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, they show screenshots and stuff.

335
00:26:04,601 --> 00:26:06,102
[SPEAKER_02]: It's great.

336
00:26:06,342 --> 00:26:06,883
[SPEAKER_01]: Very exciting.

337
00:26:06,943 --> 00:26:16,849
[SPEAKER_01]: I do like seeing them cross over into these other non-animated movie genres and stuff like that, like the Pirates of the Caribbean.

338
00:26:16,949 --> 00:26:18,129
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you hear about Steamboat Willie?

339
00:26:18,209 --> 00:26:21,011
[SPEAKER_02]: Somebody at the party yesterday was telling me about Steamboat Willie.

340
00:26:21,031 --> 00:26:21,871
[SPEAKER_02]: He's one of the stages, too.

341
00:26:21,931 --> 00:26:22,492
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't know that.

342
00:26:22,932 --> 00:26:24,113
[SPEAKER_01]: Retro Mickey or something.

343
00:26:24,133 --> 00:26:25,173
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, old, old style.

344
00:26:26,314 --> 00:26:28,637
[SPEAKER_01]: Square Enix needs to get back with Nintendo

345
00:26:44,246 --> 00:26:47,949
[SPEAKER_01]: and the Nintendo characters and stuff and just make it like Nintendo RPG or something like that.

346
00:26:48,990 --> 00:26:58,897
[SPEAKER_02]: I would like to give another plea over to Squeenix because I'm sure Kingdom Hearts 3 is inevitable and I would just like to issue a friendly reminder to Squeenix that Disney now has the license to the Muppets.

347
00:26:59,758 --> 00:27:00,298
[SPEAKER_02]: Think about it.

348
00:27:00,959 --> 00:27:01,279
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

349
00:27:03,661 --> 00:27:06,203
[SPEAKER_02]: Could be disastrous but it could be the greatest thing ever as well.

350
00:27:06,944 --> 00:27:07,424
[SPEAKER_02]: Think about it.

351
00:27:07,444 --> 00:27:08,225
[SPEAKER_02]: That's all I'm asking.

352
00:27:08,265 --> 00:27:08,725
[SPEAKER_02]: Think about it.

353
00:27:09,786 --> 00:27:09,886
[SPEAKER_01]: Ugh.

354
00:27:10,731 --> 00:27:11,373
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

355
00:27:17,867 --> 00:27:18,407
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

356
00:27:43,858 --> 00:27:48,664
[SPEAKER_02]: She just sent this over to me over text messenger, so I'm going to read this to you guys right now.

357
00:27:48,724 --> 00:27:50,386
[SPEAKER_02]: Her little report from LA.

358
00:27:51,708 --> 00:27:54,431
[SPEAKER_02]: She says, "...the drive to LA was a pain in the arse.

359
00:27:54,871 --> 00:27:57,795
[SPEAKER_02]: I've had a nasty cold and it's proceeded to get worse during the trip."

360
00:27:58,351 --> 00:28:02,713
[SPEAKER_02]: The next day was spent on homework in the two-hour drive to Ontario from Anaheim.

361
00:28:03,194 --> 00:28:05,335
[SPEAKER_02]: An hour of that was spent on the five alone.

362
00:28:06,035 --> 00:28:09,357
[SPEAKER_02]: Her friend Julie, Kasumi19, went with me on the adventure.

363
00:28:09,437 --> 00:28:14,080
[SPEAKER_02]: We arrived and met up with Frank of The Overnightscape, a podcast out of New Jersey.

364
00:28:14,540 --> 00:28:17,561
[SPEAKER_02]: He's a big gamer too, apparently, so we sat with him during the ceremony.

365
00:28:18,242 --> 00:28:21,303
[SPEAKER_02]: We also met someone from Madpod.com, sat with us too.

366
00:28:22,504 --> 00:28:25,146
[SPEAKER_02]: The issue when we tried to get in was that we didn't have badges.

367
00:28:25,346 --> 00:28:27,647
[SPEAKER_02]: I said, we're Orange Lounge Radio, we won an award.

368
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:29,420
[SPEAKER_02]: They said, will you be here tomorrow?

369
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:30,281
[SPEAKER_02]: She said, no.

370
00:28:30,381 --> 00:28:31,521
[SPEAKER_02]: And they said, fine, just go in.

371
00:28:34,282 --> 00:28:37,603
[SPEAKER_02]: Julie and her DarkSakura helped themselves to the free food.

372
00:28:38,063 --> 00:28:42,664
[SPEAKER_02]: And they sat there mesmerized by Adam Curry, who apparently was standing just a foot away from their table.

373
00:28:43,124 --> 00:28:46,505
[SPEAKER_02]: And I remember when I talked to Jamie on the phone, she didn't shut up about Adam Curry's hair.

374
00:28:46,665 --> 00:28:47,605
[SPEAKER_02]: So I thought that was funny.

375
00:28:47,885 --> 00:28:50,346
[SPEAKER_02]: And she would also like to say, for the record, he still looks fabulous.

376
00:28:51,181 --> 00:28:59,685
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, they let the first three awards winners talk, one being Mr. Curry himself, and then the People's Choice winners went up, had picks taken, and got shooed off.

377
00:29:01,345 --> 00:29:07,708
[SPEAKER_02]: We have a $25 Visa gift card and plastic trophy, pictures of which will be on the site soon.

378
00:29:07,788 --> 00:29:09,789
[SPEAKER_02]: Woohoo!

379
00:29:09,949 --> 00:29:09,789
$25!

380
00:29:10,789 --> 00:29:12,730
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a higher budget than we've ever had for this show.

381
00:29:12,750 --> 00:29:15,731
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought we wanted some web design package or blog design.

382
00:29:16,532 --> 00:29:17,152
[SPEAKER_02]: I have no idea.

383
00:29:18,539 --> 00:29:19,520
[SPEAKER_01]: Did they chip us?

384
00:29:19,540 --> 00:29:21,082
[SPEAKER_01]: Did they jack our pride?

385
00:29:21,142 --> 00:29:22,183
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't care.

386
00:29:22,503 --> 00:29:23,164
[SPEAKER_02]: Whatever.

387
00:29:23,505 --> 00:29:24,205
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not a big deal.

388
00:29:25,707 --> 00:29:26,949
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, DarkSakura continues.

389
00:29:27,329 --> 00:29:34,017
[SPEAKER_02]: After that, I mostly hung around talking to Frank and was interviewed for his podcast, so I feel inclined to give his podcast a plug.

390
00:29:34,177 --> 00:29:35,078
[SPEAKER_02]: The Overnightscape.

391
00:29:35,439 --> 00:29:37,761
[SPEAKER_02]: www.theovernightscape.com

392
00:29:38,542 --> 00:29:42,146
[SPEAKER_02]: He's awesome and his podcast was one of the nominees in the political social talk, I believe.

393
00:29:42,266 --> 00:29:42,926
[SPEAKER_02]: Very cool guy.

394
00:29:43,447 --> 00:29:44,648
[SPEAKER_02]: At any rate, that's it for me.

395
00:29:45,069 --> 00:29:47,171
[SPEAKER_02]: I do have one bit of advice for the column tonight.

396
00:29:47,651 --> 00:29:51,615
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't try to park on a hill in Julian, California, because it is friggin' impossible.

397
00:29:52,035 --> 00:29:53,377
[SPEAKER_02]: And never trust directions.

398
00:29:53,857 --> 00:29:54,097
[SPEAKER_02]: Ever.

399
00:29:54,638 --> 00:29:55,098
[SPEAKER_02]: Get a map.

400
00:29:55,719 --> 00:29:56,139
[SPEAKER_02]: The end.

401
00:29:58,241 --> 00:30:01,384
[SPEAKER_02]: That from our very own DarkSakura, who will be back next week.

402
00:30:03,325 --> 00:30:04,586
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for watching!

403
00:30:24,020 --> 00:30:34,746
[SPEAKER_02]: Industry Insider Gaming, Steve, and his podcast over there, as well as RPG MP3, World's Largest Dungeon Audio Review, because they do awesome jobs on their podcasts as well.

404
00:30:35,087 --> 00:30:49,195
[SPEAKER_02]: We are all independent, and this is probably the only year where the nominees are going to read like that, because I bet you next year, with all the built-in audience that some of those corporate podcasts have, not to knock on the corporate podcasts, you know, they're doing a good thing for the community, 1UP and GameSpot and all them, but, you know...

405
00:30:50,046 --> 00:30:52,770
[SPEAKER_02]: Probably us indies are going to have a harder time standing out next year.

406
00:30:52,871 --> 00:30:55,154
[SPEAKER_02]: So guys, we're going to have to enjoy this while it lasts.

407
00:30:55,435 --> 00:30:58,440
[SPEAKER_02]: So congratulations to you guys as well for being nominated.

408
00:31:00,082 --> 00:31:03,227
[SPEAKER_02]: But you know, how much Mountain Dew do you think it takes to get through the world's largest dungeon?

409
00:31:03,247 --> 00:31:03,989
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what I'm curious about.

410
00:31:05,178 --> 00:31:07,060
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know, but they have that new energy drink now.

411
00:31:07,140 --> 00:31:08,001
[SPEAKER_01]: That's true.

412
00:31:09,362 --> 00:31:10,203
[SPEAKER_01]: Who was it?

413
00:31:10,263 --> 00:31:12,105
[SPEAKER_01]: Someone that we knew was up 48 hours.

414
00:31:12,345 --> 00:31:15,368
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, VX... Oh, yeah.

415
00:31:15,689 --> 00:31:17,010
[SPEAKER_01]: Was up like 48 hours?

416
00:31:17,050 --> 00:31:19,032
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, 48 hours with that stuff.

417
00:31:19,052 --> 00:31:20,313
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure they drink a lot.

418
00:31:20,433 --> 00:31:22,395
[SPEAKER_02]: I tease because I love.

419
00:31:22,636 --> 00:31:22,916
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

420
00:31:24,197 --> 00:31:24,678
[SPEAKER_02]: Moving on.

421
00:31:25,916 --> 00:31:28,277
[SPEAKER_02]: This is something about Nintendo that's pissed me off for a long time.

422
00:31:28,977 --> 00:31:31,038
[SPEAKER_02]: But this plays into something you were talking about last week.

423
00:31:31,338 --> 00:31:36,001
[SPEAKER_02]: You know how I've been pissed off that Nintendo's not going to support the rev- er, not- Nintendo's not going to support the revolution.

424
00:31:36,361 --> 00:31:39,022
[SPEAKER_02]: Nintendo's not going to support HD with the revolution.

425
00:31:39,062 --> 00:31:41,823
[SPEAKER_02]: And as somebody who recently bought an HD TV, that kind of pissed me off.

426
00:31:42,103 --> 00:31:45,585
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I wanted to see Nintendo kind of embrace the HD technology like everyone's doing.

427
00:31:46,165 --> 00:31:51,768
[SPEAKER_02]: And there was kind of this, they said this a long time ago, but there were rumors just very recently that they were going back on this.

428
00:31:51,908 --> 00:31:53,328
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, here's the thing.

429
00:31:53,748 --> 00:32:02,312
[SPEAKER_02]: There was an interview on CNN Money, and they chatted with Nintendo of America Executive VP of Sales and Marketing, Reggie Fils-Aime.

430
00:32:03,012 --> 00:32:10,696
[SPEAKER_02]: And he said that what we'll offer in terms of gameplay and approachability will more than make up for the lack of HD.

431
00:32:13,126 --> 00:32:17,097
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm thinking, shit, this just buys into what Loki said last week about the stereoscope in 3D.

432
00:32:17,518 --> 00:32:18,320
[SPEAKER_02]: It all makes sense.

433
00:32:19,261 --> 00:32:22,022
[SPEAKER_02]: They can't do it on an HD TV, that's why they're not going to support it.

434
00:32:22,783 --> 00:32:29,586
[SPEAKER_02]: Because then it goes on to say that when you have the HD support, you have really long loading times as well.

435
00:32:29,846 --> 00:32:32,827
[SPEAKER_02]: And I kind of noticed that Halo kind of seems to load a little longer than it used to.

436
00:32:33,247 --> 00:32:36,849
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know, maybe it's just I'm insane, but it seems to have a slightly longer load time.

437
00:32:36,929 --> 00:32:42,192
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't mind waiting a little bit longer for pretty games, but maybe this all buys into what you were saying.

438
00:32:42,212 --> 00:32:42,752
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll find out.

439
00:32:43,112 --> 00:32:44,232
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll find out early December.

440
00:32:44,413 --> 00:32:45,033
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it'll be cool.

441
00:32:45,899 --> 00:32:46,219
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll see.

442
00:32:46,859 --> 00:32:47,960
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki, what do you have for us tonight?

443
00:32:48,460 --> 00:32:49,440
[SPEAKER_01]: A couple things.

444
00:32:50,280 --> 00:32:54,861
[SPEAKER_01]: First thing will be kind of... Let's see here.

445
00:32:55,502 --> 00:33:01,803
[SPEAKER_01]: My favorite topic of discussion is how hackers have broken the PSP.

446
00:33:03,224 --> 00:33:08,345
[SPEAKER_01]: And Sony's really having trouble with their copy protection stuff this week with the whole CD...

447
00:33:09,264 --> 00:33:10,104
[SPEAKER_01]: DRM Rootkit

448
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:30,262
[SPEAKER_01]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

449
00:33:57,848 --> 00:33:58,949
[SPEAKER_01]: PSP3D.com PSP3D.com PSP3D.com

450
00:34:24,328 --> 00:34:29,491
[SPEAKER_01]: They actually had a version of that exploit that they converted into a save file.

451
00:34:29,551 --> 00:34:39,156
[SPEAKER_01]: So basically, you load this save file either in a game or just in their save file browser thing there to actually be able to launch this.

452
00:34:39,276 --> 00:34:41,998
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's a bootbin file where you can launch your own code.

453
00:34:42,418 --> 00:34:48,101
[SPEAKER_01]: So in theory, this should work to be able to run a downgrader later on or...

454
00:34:48,999 --> 00:34:49,859
[SPEAKER_01]: Something to that effect.

455
00:34:50,419 --> 00:34:54,020
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, a new firmware update is expected.

456
00:34:54,280 --> 00:34:59,042
[SPEAKER_01]: And I believe the new thing that they're adding with the new firmware is going to be e-book reader.

457
00:34:59,262 --> 00:35:01,022
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually saw the story on this.

458
00:35:01,342 --> 00:35:02,023
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, that's cool.

459
00:35:03,163 --> 00:35:03,883
[SPEAKER_01]: Be interesting.

460
00:35:04,143 --> 00:35:05,264
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's kind of pointless.

461
00:35:05,744 --> 00:35:09,345
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe a web browser with, I don't know, Java support would be nice.

462
00:35:09,365 --> 00:35:10,085
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

463
00:35:10,685 --> 00:35:11,025
[SPEAKER_01]: But, yeah.

464
00:35:12,145 --> 00:35:13,366
[SPEAKER_01]: So, that's that.

465
00:35:13,586 --> 00:35:17,447
[SPEAKER_01]: The other thing that was kind of cool is they were showing some screenshots of the Gradius...

466
00:35:18,263 --> 00:35:20,245
[SPEAKER_01]: Grotius Collection that's going to be coming out.

467
00:35:20,345 --> 00:35:20,946
[SPEAKER_01]: That's exciting.

468
00:35:20,966 --> 00:35:21,947
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that looks really sweet.

469
00:35:21,987 --> 00:35:23,369
[SPEAKER_01]: That's definitely a PSP game I've got to check out.

470
00:35:23,889 --> 00:35:24,750
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's going to be nice.

471
00:35:25,151 --> 00:35:33,620
[SPEAKER_01]: They showed both the kind of pan and scan version of the old games and then the widescreen version, which is kind of neat.

472
00:35:34,841 --> 00:35:36,802
[SPEAKER_02]: DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

473
00:35:59,284 --> 00:36:00,986
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, bow down to the DDR King.

474
00:36:02,067 --> 00:36:03,388
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey guys, love the podcast.

475
00:36:03,428 --> 00:36:06,211
[SPEAKER_02]: Helps to make my workday fly by like I am high on drugs.

476
00:36:07,352 --> 00:36:13,958
[SPEAKER_02]: Now I know you are all addicted to the Bomani games as much as me, and here is where you can flaunt your geekness and help me out all at the same time.

477
00:36:14,419 --> 00:36:15,900
[SPEAKER_02]: Dance Dance Documentary.

478
00:36:16,401 --> 00:36:18,363
[SPEAKER_02]: Where or where do I find it?

479
00:36:18,743 --> 00:36:19,584
[SPEAKER_02]: Help a honky out.

480
00:36:20,936 --> 00:36:21,837
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I googled it.

481
00:36:22,437 --> 00:36:23,078
[SPEAKER_02]: I couldn't find it.

482
00:36:23,258 --> 00:36:25,879
[SPEAKER_02]: I have no idea where you can get this movie.

483
00:36:26,220 --> 00:36:32,284
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm telling you, I was interviewed for some movie that they were doing on DDR, and I don't know if this is the same one or not.

484
00:36:32,864 --> 00:36:36,267
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it was, and it never came to be.

485
00:36:36,367 --> 00:36:38,088
[SPEAKER_02]: No, if you go to Internet Movie Database...

486
00:36:38,889 --> 00:36:39,630
[SPEAKER_02]: This is one thing I like.

487
00:36:39,670 --> 00:36:42,893
[SPEAKER_02]: You can actually see Dance Dance Documentary on Internet Movie Database.

488
00:36:43,114 --> 00:36:44,535
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is what I really wanted to talk about.

489
00:36:44,856 --> 00:36:49,261
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry buddy, I don't know where you can get this movie because I cannot find a website where they are selling this movie.

490
00:36:49,821 --> 00:36:55,488
[SPEAKER_02]: But I was drawn to this entry on Internet Movie Database because it actually has like a full entry here and a review.

491
00:36:55,948 --> 00:36:57,349
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's like, what's going on?

492
00:36:57,369 --> 00:36:59,350
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't show your name as one of the actors.

493
00:36:59,490 --> 00:37:04,874
[SPEAKER_02]: No, but it shows other people that we know very well, like Mel B and some of the other people in the community.

494
00:37:04,914 --> 00:37:08,116
[SPEAKER_02]: They're all listed here, and they have internet movie database entries.

495
00:37:08,176 --> 00:37:08,877
[SPEAKER_02]: How cool is that?

496
00:37:08,917 --> 00:37:16,902
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, you could click on Mel here and get to his whole page, almost like he's a card-carrying member of the Screen Actors Guild now or something.

497
00:37:17,262 --> 00:37:17,763
[SPEAKER_02]: That's kind of fun.

498
00:37:17,783 --> 00:37:18,023
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

499
00:37:18,043 --> 00:37:18,703
[SPEAKER_02]: That cracked me up.

500
00:37:19,063 --> 00:37:21,805
[SPEAKER_02]: As a longtime member of the Bomani community, this cracked me up.

501
00:37:25,828 --> 00:37:26,128
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah.

502
00:37:54,501 --> 00:37:58,123
[SPEAKER_02]: Even though we've been doing this for, you know, what, three and a half years?

503
00:37:58,143 --> 00:37:59,204
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's go on to another email.

504
00:37:59,464 --> 00:38:00,284
[SPEAKER_02]: We have another email.

505
00:38:01,585 --> 00:38:08,509
[SPEAKER_02]: It's our buddy Deakman saying, Hi, I'm back from Canada and have just finished catching up on the last month or so worth of shows.

506
00:38:08,969 --> 00:38:13,672
[SPEAKER_02]: I heard you guys read out some release lists for the US and the UK, but nothing for Australia.

507
00:38:14,588 --> 00:38:15,449
[SPEAKER_02]: So he sent us a link.

508
00:38:15,469 --> 00:38:18,631
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, checking out the Frapper, you know, we were plugging the Frapper last week.

509
00:38:19,031 --> 00:38:21,974
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't realize, like, every freaking podcast out there has a Frapper.

510
00:38:22,154 --> 00:38:26,257
[SPEAKER_02]: Because, like, now this week I'm looking at other sites and, like, put yourself on the Frapper.

511
00:38:26,317 --> 00:38:27,138
[SPEAKER_02]: Put yourself on the Frapper.

512
00:38:27,178 --> 00:38:27,998
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, oh, wow.

513
00:38:28,198 --> 00:38:30,900
[SPEAKER_02]: We apparently jumped on this bandwagon way late.

514
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:31,821
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's still cool.

515
00:38:32,001 --> 00:38:33,983
[SPEAKER_02]: So put yourself on the Frapper for Orange Lounge.

516
00:38:34,363 --> 00:38:36,925
[SPEAKER_02]: But looking at the Frapper, we have some pins in Australia.

517
00:38:37,245 --> 00:38:39,187
[SPEAKER_02]: So we got to recognize our Aussie fan base.

518
00:38:39,207 --> 00:38:42,469
[SPEAKER_01]: The only thing I don't like about the Frapper is I can't actually put myself where I live.

519
00:38:42,509 --> 00:38:43,290
[SPEAKER_01]: Instead, it's just...

520
00:38:43,550 --> 00:38:44,171
[SPEAKER_02]: Matrix, Pathineo

521
00:39:05,749 --> 00:39:07,672
[SPEAKER_02]: Also same day, Soul Calibur 3.

522
00:39:08,453 --> 00:39:12,759
[SPEAKER_02]: Coming out on 25th November, Shadow the Hedgehog and the Capcom Classics Collection.

523
00:39:13,139 --> 00:39:14,962
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we go into the December.

524
00:39:15,022 --> 00:39:23,193
[SPEAKER_02]: We have 1st of December, you guys are getting WWE Smackdown vs. Raw, which honestly I never really got into the wrestling games, but I know some folks are into them, so whatever.

525
00:39:23,773 --> 00:39:26,295
[SPEAKER_02]: Prince of Persia 3, Two Thrones on 8th of December.

526
00:39:26,355 --> 00:39:27,115
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, that'll be pretty cool.

527
00:39:27,455 --> 00:39:30,397
[SPEAKER_02]: Sega Classics Collection, you guys are finally getting on 10th of December.

528
00:39:30,777 --> 00:39:35,060
[SPEAKER_02]: And then on into 2006, you guys will be getting Oz, which I don't even think we're getting here.

529
00:39:35,560 --> 00:39:38,882
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys are getting that on 28th of February, so feel lucky about that one.

530
00:39:39,222 --> 00:39:42,164
[SPEAKER_02]: And then on March 13th, you guys are getting Godfather.

531
00:39:42,305 --> 00:39:44,106
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, that all being on the PlayStation 2.

532
00:39:44,887 --> 00:39:46,168
[SPEAKER_02]: You want to go to some other systems.

533
00:39:47,008 --> 00:39:51,412
[SPEAKER_02]: Over in Australia, you guys are getting King Kong for the Xbox on 17th of November.

534
00:39:51,512 --> 00:39:53,373
[SPEAKER_02]: Half-Life 2 on 21st of November.

535
00:39:54,134 --> 00:39:59,198
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you go to some other systems such as the GameCube, Pokemon XD this week on 15th of November.

536
00:39:59,778 --> 00:40:02,761
[SPEAKER_02]: And Fire Emblem Path of Radiance on 1st of December.

537
00:40:03,441 --> 00:40:07,084
[SPEAKER_02]: And over on the DS, you guys are getting Burnout Legends on the 12th of December.

538
00:40:07,700 --> 00:40:10,701
[SPEAKER_02]: and Phoenix Wright, Ace Attorney, 28th of February.

539
00:40:10,761 --> 00:40:16,603
[SPEAKER_01]: I like how sometimes they get games before us like King Kong isn't here until the week of the 21st.

540
00:40:18,504 --> 00:40:20,205
[SPEAKER_02]: Just interesting the way it works out sometimes.

541
00:40:21,462 --> 00:40:22,543
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for watching.

542
00:40:22,583 --> 00:40:23,123
[SPEAKER_02]: See you next time.

543
00:40:43,337 --> 00:40:47,420
[SPEAKER_02]: He actually got to go to the show in Vancouver, so he wants to share what was going on.

544
00:40:47,460 --> 00:40:50,123
[SPEAKER_02]: He said the show was great, great sound, great lighting.

545
00:40:50,523 --> 00:40:51,844
[SPEAKER_02]: The production values were great.

546
00:40:51,984 --> 00:40:53,765
[SPEAKER_02]: Each piece was accompanied by game footage.

547
00:40:54,006 --> 00:40:55,247
[SPEAKER_02]: It was an incredible combination.

548
00:40:55,547 --> 00:40:58,309
[SPEAKER_02]: The show started with what they called classic arcade medley.

549
00:40:58,629 --> 00:41:06,856
[SPEAKER_02]: This segment started with the primitive beeps and boops from games like Pong, Space Invaders, and Defender, and then transitioned into the games with some sorts of music in it like Donkey Kong.

550
00:41:07,276 --> 00:41:07,696
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, good.

551
00:41:07,716 --> 00:41:09,417
[SPEAKER_02]: That doesn't sound as hokey as I thought that was going to be.

552
00:41:09,577 --> 00:41:12,477
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm really glad that that was the way they opened.

553
00:41:12,497 --> 00:41:13,778
[SPEAKER_02]: That sounds cool.

554
00:41:14,238 --> 00:41:18,659
[SPEAKER_02]: Lastly, they played music from the classics with true orchestration like Dragon's Lair and Outrun.

555
00:41:19,339 --> 00:41:28,081
[SPEAKER_02]: They proceeded to play music from games like Metal Gear Solid, Zelda, God of War, Beyond Good and Evil, Castlevania, Myst, Warcraft, Advent Rising, Halo, etc.

556
00:41:29,061 --> 00:41:31,082
[SPEAKER_02]: The show was an astounding orchestral experience.

557
00:41:31,182 --> 00:41:33,862
[SPEAKER_02]: I believe that both gamers and non-gamers would enjoy it equally.

558
00:41:34,222 --> 00:41:36,403
[SPEAKER_02]: It's too bad that they had to cancel most of their shows.

559
00:41:36,883 --> 00:41:41,405
[SPEAKER_02]: So, a positive review of this show coming to us from Edmund.

560
00:41:41,806 --> 00:41:46,348
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, if you want to send us an email, 2go at orangeloungeradio.com is the place to send it.

561
00:41:46,948 --> 00:41:50,130
[SPEAKER_02]: And we hope we'll be reading your email on a future podcast.

562
00:41:50,630 --> 00:41:51,531
[SPEAKER_02]: For now, back to the news.

563
00:41:51,591 --> 00:41:52,411
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki, what do you got for us?

564
00:41:52,932 --> 00:41:53,512
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

565
00:41:54,953 --> 00:41:56,193
[SPEAKER_01]: The other things I was going to be mentioning.

566
00:41:56,213 --> 00:41:59,055
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a ton of stuff, of course, with the 360 launch going on.

567
00:41:59,635 --> 00:42:01,596
[SPEAKER_01]: Some things I found really funny.

568
00:42:02,117 --> 00:42:03,577
[SPEAKER_01]: The first one being, of course...

569
00:42:04,858 --> 00:42:07,700
[SPEAKER_01]: The golden tickets that are being given out at Walmart, I think those are just hilarious.

570
00:42:14,218 --> 00:42:19,782
[SPEAKER_01]: Apparently, this is one of those things, you know, they're going to be handling theirs, you know, first-come, first-served type line thing.

571
00:42:19,822 --> 00:42:20,622
[SPEAKER_01]: But you get a ticket.

572
00:42:21,203 --> 00:42:24,665
[SPEAKER_01]: What's great about the thing, though, is the tickets are a little bit confusing.

573
00:42:24,705 --> 00:42:28,207
[SPEAKER_01]: They are for the opposite of the, you know, colored box that they're supposed to be.

574
00:42:28,247 --> 00:42:32,870
[SPEAKER_01]: So the green tickets are for the white box, and the white tickets are for the... Oh, that won't cause any confusion at all, I'm sure.

575
00:42:32,890 --> 00:42:34,111
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, actually, no, I take that back.

576
00:42:34,131 --> 00:42:34,431
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sorry.

577
00:42:34,451 --> 00:42:35,612
[SPEAKER_01]: They're for the same boxes.

578
00:42:36,112 --> 00:42:38,494
[SPEAKER_01]: However, their little form tells them what...

579
00:42:39,194 --> 00:42:40,134
[SPEAKER_01]: and ones which.

580
00:42:40,674 --> 00:42:44,175
[SPEAKER_01]: The white box is going to be the $2.99 and the green box being $3.99.

581
00:42:44,855 --> 00:42:49,936
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, for all those who are pre-ordering those, those are completely opposite.

582
00:42:50,076 --> 00:42:56,838
[SPEAKER_01]: So some people hopefully will be getting their systems for $100 less than they would have to be paying, which I think is quite funny.

583
00:42:58,398 --> 00:43:04,219
[SPEAKER_01]: The other thing which is interesting, and this is completely on a different subject here.

584
00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:07,480
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, same subject.

585
00:43:08,012 --> 00:43:09,714
[SPEAKER_01]: Xbox 360 Zero Hour.

586
00:43:09,754 --> 00:43:12,757
[SPEAKER_01]: It's an event that's going on in the Mojave Desert.

587
00:43:13,698 --> 00:43:15,720
[SPEAKER_02]: I wanted to see if we could go to that.

588
00:43:16,641 --> 00:43:19,364
[SPEAKER_02]: Real work calls.

589
00:43:19,824 --> 00:43:25,110
[SPEAKER_01]: In order to get a ticket, they were doing this Blitz thing on Thursday where you would have

590
00:43:25,956 --> 00:43:29,978
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe there's like 12 sites participating, all the major gaming sites.

591
00:43:32,399 --> 00:43:35,301
[SPEAKER_01]: Basically, they were giving out... What do you mean all the major gaming sites?

592
00:43:35,421 --> 00:43:36,242
[SPEAKER_02]: We weren't in on it.

593
00:43:36,702 --> 00:43:39,543
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, but we don't have an actual huge budget like they do, okay?

594
00:43:39,703 --> 00:43:41,424
[SPEAKER_02]: No, we have $25 now, remember?

595
00:43:42,005 --> 00:43:43,005
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I'm sorry.

596
00:43:43,225 --> 00:43:44,366
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a $25 budget now.

597
00:43:44,606 --> 00:43:53,671
[SPEAKER_01]: No, anyways, so they were giving out... I believe each site was giving out about 360 tickets, and then the rest of them were going to be randomly drawn...

598
00:43:54,251 --> 00:43:55,512
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, Monday.

599
00:43:56,753 --> 00:43:59,376
[SPEAKER_01]: So, we'll find out who gets to go.

600
00:43:59,396 --> 00:44:08,023
[SPEAKER_01]: 3,000 people, including VIPs, which will be contest winners from the Origin website and, of course, the Hex168 site.

601
00:44:08,583 --> 00:44:14,008
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll be going there, and you'll be greeted with 48 hours of pure gaming fun.

602
00:44:14,028 --> 00:44:16,870
[SPEAKER_02]: So, is this like Burning Man with more games and less nudity?

603
00:44:17,551 --> 00:44:17,811
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

604
00:44:17,951 --> 00:44:19,712
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

605
00:44:19,832 --> 00:44:21,914
[SPEAKER_01]: And celebrities who really have no point being there.

606
00:44:22,094 --> 00:44:22,254
[SPEAKER_01]: But...

607
00:44:23,836 --> 00:44:30,562
[SPEAKER_01]: And you'll also get to buy your Xbox 360 a whole couple hours earlier than everybody else.

608
00:44:43,080 --> 00:44:46,423
[SPEAKER_02]: This just feeds into what I was talking about at the beginning of the cast, why I'm not doing this.

609
00:44:46,583 --> 00:44:48,224
[SPEAKER_02]: Why I'm just not going to do it anymore.

610
00:44:48,825 --> 00:44:49,765
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, here's why.

611
00:44:49,825 --> 00:44:53,989
[SPEAKER_01]: It makes sense when you find out why they're trying to force games on you.

612
00:44:54,489 --> 00:45:02,817
[SPEAKER_01]: In order to be able to have Xboxes at launch, you have to promise Microsoft you're going to do $10 million in business by the end of the year.

613
00:45:03,337 --> 00:45:03,977
[SPEAKER_01]: Or else what?

614
00:45:04,978 --> 00:45:05,379
[SPEAKER_02]: Or else...

615
00:45:07,236 --> 00:45:08,877
[SPEAKER_02]: Or else what, they're going to slap you on the wrist?

616
00:45:09,657 --> 00:45:13,439
[SPEAKER_02]: What, you're going to give a severe penalty to a big company like Best Buy?

617
00:45:13,979 --> 00:45:16,741
[SPEAKER_02]: Crap, if I were a company like that, I'd pull your crap off my shelves.

618
00:45:16,781 --> 00:45:18,782
[SPEAKER_02]: Good luck selling your damn system under these rules.

619
00:45:20,182 --> 00:45:23,084
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just some gaming fan with a little podcast.

620
00:45:23,464 --> 00:45:26,906
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe I don't understand the bigger scope of things, so I'm sure I'll get emails on that.

621
00:45:26,926 --> 00:45:29,967
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to understand, they don't care.

622
00:45:30,067 --> 00:45:31,508
[SPEAKER_01]: You're nobody to them.

623
00:45:33,269 --> 00:45:34,129
[SPEAKER_02]: My money, damn it!

624
00:45:34,574 --> 00:45:35,315
[SPEAKER_02]: I should be somebody.

625
00:45:35,395 --> 00:45:36,516
[SPEAKER_02]: The customer is always right.

626
00:45:36,896 --> 00:45:43,861
[SPEAKER_01]: Anywho, in other news, I will file air the... It was bound to happen sooner or later.

627
00:45:44,802 --> 00:45:48,505
[SPEAKER_01]: Nintendo is talking about possibly redesigning the DS.

628
00:45:51,409 --> 00:45:52,530
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, so I can buy it again?

629
00:45:52,710 --> 00:45:53,271
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah!

630
00:45:53,291 --> 00:45:55,953
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, just like how there's like 50 different Game Boys out there I could buy?

631
00:45:56,233 --> 00:45:56,814
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.

632
00:45:56,834 --> 00:45:57,755
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, what a shock.

633
00:45:58,336 --> 00:46:04,602
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, Reggie fills, I mean, dropped a hint that the DS may be due for a redesign.

634
00:46:05,843 --> 00:46:08,906
[SPEAKER_01]: Basically, yeah, it's not a surprise.

635
00:46:08,946 --> 00:46:12,850
[SPEAKER_01]: They're going to make it sleeker, I guess, and smaller, and yadda yadda yadda yadda.

636
00:46:15,017 --> 00:46:15,738
[SPEAKER_02]: Not a big surprise.

637
00:46:16,818 --> 00:46:18,038
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, I got a story over here.

638
00:46:18,439 --> 00:46:21,280
[SPEAKER_02]: NCSoft, you know NCSoft, they make Guild Wars.

639
00:46:21,940 --> 00:46:26,662
[SPEAKER_02]: NCSoft is saying that they are going to be working on a console game.

640
00:46:27,262 --> 00:46:35,445
[SPEAKER_02]: Chief Executive Tak Jin Kim mentioned that they were developing for the next generation consoles, but they're not saying exactly what they're doing.

641
00:46:35,505 --> 00:46:41,468
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you think about it, well, they do MMOs, so that would seem like the most logical thing they're going to put out.

642
00:46:42,168 --> 00:46:42,248
[SPEAKER_02]: Um...

643
00:46:42,768 --> 00:46:43,228
[SPEAKER_02]: But who knows?

644
00:46:43,308 --> 00:46:43,949
[SPEAKER_02]: Anything is possible.

645
00:46:43,989 --> 00:46:48,391
[SPEAKER_02]: And I would think if they're going to put out an MMO, Xbox 360 is probably going to be where they gravitate to.

646
00:46:48,491 --> 00:46:49,192
[SPEAKER_02]: But who knows?

647
00:46:49,452 --> 00:46:50,613
[SPEAKER_02]: Anything is possible at this juncture.

648
00:46:50,993 --> 00:46:52,794
[SPEAKER_02]: But we do know NCSofts will be developing something.

649
00:46:53,354 --> 00:46:55,455
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought they'd launch this port Guild Wars to the console.

650
00:46:55,496 --> 00:46:57,957
[SPEAKER_02]: I bet a lot of people might get a kick out of that.

651
00:46:58,017 --> 00:46:59,158
[SPEAKER_02]: But what do I know?

652
00:46:59,718 --> 00:47:01,119
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, I'm just some guy.

653
00:47:02,317 --> 00:47:06,943
[SPEAKER_01]: for those people who like to play games on their computer that they shouldn't be playing.

654
00:47:07,023 --> 00:47:08,044
[SPEAKER_01]: Shame, shame, shame.

655
00:47:08,084 --> 00:47:08,925
[SPEAKER_01]: What, emulators?

656
00:47:09,085 --> 00:47:09,505
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, anyways.

657
00:47:10,246 --> 00:47:15,492
[SPEAKER_01]: So there was a long-awaited mod that takes Legends of the Ocarina of Time

658
00:47:15,993 --> 00:47:18,333
[SPEAKER_01]: and updates the graphics with high res textures.

659
00:47:18,413 --> 00:47:19,854
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it's finally out, folks.

660
00:47:20,294 --> 00:47:24,254
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, you will need the raw man emulator to play it.

661
00:47:24,835 --> 00:47:35,797
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyways, you can definitely find this link at 4colorrebellion.com and it's one of the posts that they put on there from today, actually.

662
00:47:36,417 --> 00:47:37,177
[SPEAKER_01]: November 13th.

663
00:47:38,157 --> 00:47:39,217
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's kind of interesting.

664
00:47:39,517 --> 00:47:43,998
[SPEAKER_01]: I personally didn't get to play Ocarina of Time, even though I had the disc for the GameCube, you know, the

665
00:47:45,134 --> 00:47:46,215
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's the weird thing.

666
00:47:46,575 --> 00:47:51,497
[SPEAKER_02]: I understand that Ocarina of Time is a treasured game.

667
00:47:51,557 --> 00:47:56,299
[SPEAKER_02]: When you ask people, what is your favorite game of all time, Ocarina of Time almost always comes near the top of the list.

668
00:47:57,080 --> 00:47:59,200
[SPEAKER_02]: I did not get as into this Zelda.

669
00:47:59,561 --> 00:48:03,142
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm in some category by myself sometimes, I feel like.

670
00:48:03,262 --> 00:48:04,163
[SPEAKER_02]: I did not get into it.

671
00:48:04,483 --> 00:48:08,665
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't know if it's the 3D thing that really just threw me that I never was able to get over, but...

672
00:48:09,662 --> 00:48:16,428
[SPEAKER_02]: I just keep going back to the Super Nintendo Zelda, you know, and how freaking wonderful that game was linked to the past.

673
00:48:16,909 --> 00:48:18,650
[SPEAKER_02]: And just to me, nothing compares to that.

674
00:48:18,750 --> 00:48:22,374
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't even know if this new Zelda will compare to linked to the past to me.

675
00:48:22,414 --> 00:48:26,818
[SPEAKER_02]: But at the same time, the new Zelda looks very, very sexy.

676
00:48:26,858 --> 00:48:28,780
[SPEAKER_02]: So maybe all will be forgiven, but we'll see.

677
00:48:29,620 --> 00:48:30,561
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll be interesting.

678
00:48:30,661 --> 00:48:31,282
[SPEAKER_02]: Anything else, Loki?

679
00:48:31,966 --> 00:48:33,307
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, yeah, a couple more things.

680
00:48:33,648 --> 00:48:46,418
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, first, of course, the game I've been, um, watching closely, Project Gotham Reason 3, I actually watched, they had this 25 minute video discussing, like, all the details that went into the graphics, the physics, and everything, and the game looks amazing.

681
00:48:46,958 --> 00:48:50,041
[SPEAKER_01]: But, apparently, it might not truly be high def.

682
00:48:50,821 --> 00:48:51,702
[SPEAKER_01]: Big freaking whoop.

683
00:48:52,263 --> 00:48:57,687
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but, apparently, um, there was a test version of the game that was shipped out to, um,

684
00:48:58,274 --> 00:49:02,057
[SPEAKER_01]: A reviewer, and they actually did a screen cap of it straight from the machine.

685
00:49:03,458 --> 00:49:05,359
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyways, dumping the graphic buffer or something like that.

686
00:49:05,980 --> 00:49:10,163
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's 1024x600 instead of 1024x720.

687
00:49:10,223 --> 00:49:11,184
[SPEAKER_01]: Big friggin' whoop.

688
00:49:11,404 --> 00:49:14,206
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's not that, you know, the exact same detail.

689
00:49:14,566 --> 00:49:15,707
[SPEAKER_01]: The game looks amazing, though.

690
00:49:15,967 --> 00:49:17,889
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, of course, it's controversy, you know.

691
00:49:18,755 --> 00:49:19,055
[SPEAKER_01]: and so on.

692
00:49:34,008 --> 00:49:49,917
[SPEAKER_01]: or actually I should say Activision signed a deal with Marvel extending their partnership for another 12 years or so basically allowing them to make games until 2017 using the licenses of Marvel and it's going to be exclusive with them so

693
00:49:50,540 --> 00:49:54,681
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll see wonderful games such as more Spider-Man and more X-Men games coming out.

694
00:49:54,741 --> 00:49:58,883
[SPEAKER_01]: Not to say that they don't do bad games, because the Ultimate Spider-Man was really good.

695
00:49:58,963 --> 00:50:00,723
[SPEAKER_02]: I heard very, very good things about that Spider-Man game.

696
00:50:00,763 --> 00:50:01,503
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't play it myself.

697
00:50:01,964 --> 00:50:05,225
[SPEAKER_01]: And X-Men Legends 2 was supposed to be pretty good, too.

698
00:50:05,505 --> 00:50:07,665
[SPEAKER_02]: See, X-Men Legends 1 disappointed the hell out of me.

699
00:50:07,825 --> 00:50:11,146
[SPEAKER_02]: I was not a big fan of it, but I have heard that 2 is much better, so we'll see.

700
00:50:11,166 --> 00:50:13,507
[SPEAKER_01]: 2 is much better because you don't have to unlock multiplayer.

701
00:50:13,547 --> 00:50:14,507
[SPEAKER_01]: That was retarded.

702
00:50:14,528 --> 00:50:17,809
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember when we got that game, we were just like, oh, yeah, let's play multiplayer.

703
00:50:18,029 --> 00:50:19,069
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, wait, we can't.

704
00:50:21,729 --> 00:50:24,971
[SPEAKER_02]: Speaking of Activision, I just wanted to drop this out there.

705
00:50:25,031 --> 00:50:27,713
[SPEAKER_02]: Quake 4 is going to be a 360 launch title.

706
00:50:27,753 --> 00:50:28,634
[SPEAKER_02]: It is coming out in time.

707
00:50:29,294 --> 00:50:36,658
[SPEAKER_02]: And with all the news about all these games getting pushed back, I suppose it would be refreshing for a change if you're an Xbox 360 fan to hear that Quake 4 will be dropping at launch.

708
00:50:36,798 --> 00:50:38,159
[SPEAKER_01]: It was going to be dropping at launch.

709
00:50:38,179 --> 00:50:39,620
[SPEAKER_01]: That was originally the case.

710
00:50:39,700 --> 00:50:41,121
[SPEAKER_01]: It was supposed to be on the 21st.

711
00:50:41,321 --> 00:50:42,442
[SPEAKER_01]: I heard now it's going to be the 18th.

712
00:50:42,802 --> 00:50:43,902
[SPEAKER_02]: It is the 18th.

713
00:50:43,922 --> 00:50:47,683
[SPEAKER_02]: I just wanted to say that it has been confirmed by the studio it is happening.

714
00:50:48,284 --> 00:50:50,524
[SPEAKER_02]: Eight player support over Xbox Live.

715
00:50:50,824 --> 00:50:51,424
[SPEAKER_02]: Just an FYI.

716
00:50:52,565 --> 00:50:53,305
[SPEAKER_01]: That's really cool.

717
00:50:53,845 --> 00:50:58,506
[SPEAKER_01]: And it also has been reported that DOA 4 is actually pushed back to December now.

718
00:50:58,646 --> 00:50:58,926
[SPEAKER_02]: See?

719
00:50:59,667 --> 00:51:02,067
[SPEAKER_02]: That was the game I was looking forward to more than any other.

720
00:51:02,327 --> 00:51:08,169
[SPEAKER_01]: But for now, before we all jump the gun here, it was only pushed back a week.

721
00:51:08,269 --> 00:51:09,329
[SPEAKER_01]: It's December 1st.

722
00:51:11,090 --> 00:51:11,410
[SPEAKER_01]: Big whoop.

723
00:51:11,450 --> 00:51:12,030
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's like

724
00:51:12,386 --> 00:51:13,167
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

725
00:51:37,332 --> 00:51:39,573
[SPEAKER_01]: There's tons of stuff, and I can wait seven days for a game.

726
00:51:39,613 --> 00:51:41,314
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you're going to be picking up launch games anyways.

727
00:51:41,354 --> 00:51:42,955
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't need to have six games at launch.

728
00:51:43,895 --> 00:51:46,596
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I do, but, you know, that's just me.

729
00:51:48,037 --> 00:51:50,838
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll still be playing Mario Kart DS for the next three weeks, hopefully.

730
00:51:51,238 --> 00:51:51,818
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, hell yes.

731
00:51:52,039 --> 00:51:56,601
[SPEAKER_01]: I have to dominate the rankings for that.

732
00:51:56,621 --> 00:51:57,621
[SPEAKER_02]: Good luck.

733
00:51:58,021 --> 00:51:58,561
[SPEAKER_02]: Good luck.

734
00:51:58,581 --> 00:52:06,325
[SPEAKER_02]: There are some sick, sick, sick Nintendo fanboys that will beat you up really bad online, and some of them are probably listening and can't wait to kick your ass.

735
00:52:07,071 --> 00:52:08,352
[SPEAKER_02]: All will be answered very soon.

736
00:52:36,184 --> 00:52:39,405
[SPEAKER_01]: It's still going to be all drama this entire week is basically it.

737
00:52:40,005 --> 00:52:43,505
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, that's pretty much what I've got.

738
00:52:44,005 --> 00:52:44,726
[SPEAKER_01]: Just that stuff.

739
00:52:45,166 --> 00:52:46,406
[SPEAKER_01]: Quake 3 for the Pocket PC.

740
00:52:47,666 --> 00:52:48,966
[SPEAKER_01]: But who owns a Pocket PC?

741
00:52:48,986 --> 00:52:53,247
[SPEAKER_01]: Who really wants to play Quake 3 on a Pocket PC anyway?

742
00:52:53,607 --> 00:52:55,568
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, who wants to run Linux on a DS?

743
00:52:55,628 --> 00:52:56,528
[SPEAKER_02]: But they do it anyway.

744
00:52:58,048 --> 00:52:59,388
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, okay, it does make homebrew possible.

745
00:52:59,448 --> 00:53:00,048
[SPEAKER_01]: I take that back.

746
00:53:00,088 --> 00:53:03,549
[SPEAKER_01]: And in the story of it's really been a slow news week...

747
00:53:04,590 --> 00:53:06,712
[SPEAKER_01]: People have been reporting on numerous websites.

748
00:53:06,772 --> 00:53:11,576
[SPEAKER_01]: When you pop in Cameo on your Xbox, it says put in Xbox 360, dumbass.

749
00:53:12,517 --> 00:53:15,800
[SPEAKER_01]: Not really, but it basically says this is meant to be played on.

750
00:53:16,240 --> 00:53:19,803
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's what people do with their games that they buy before the console is out.

751
00:53:19,883 --> 00:53:21,284
[SPEAKER_02]: I wondered why people did that.

752
00:53:21,424 --> 00:53:22,646
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, all is answered.

753
00:53:22,686 --> 00:53:23,046
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

754
00:53:23,286 --> 00:53:27,047
[SPEAKER_01]: All other things, you know, from, you know, instruction manuals being online for the 360.

755
00:53:27,148 --> 00:53:32,069
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, people are just dying to get anything, you know.

756
00:53:32,289 --> 00:53:33,570
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sick of the hype.

757
00:53:33,670 --> 00:53:34,210
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry.

758
00:53:34,350 --> 00:53:37,671
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not trying to be anti-Xbox here, but I am sick of the hype.

759
00:53:38,232 --> 00:53:40,212
[SPEAKER_02]: You know if you want the damn system or not by now.

760
00:53:40,533 --> 00:53:41,373
[SPEAKER_02]: Have fun if you do.

761
00:53:42,113 --> 00:53:43,834
[SPEAKER_02]: Have fun waiting if you don't or whatever.

762
00:53:43,894 --> 00:53:45,614
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just, I'm done.

763
00:53:46,995 --> 00:53:47,815
[SPEAKER_02]: I got one more story.

764
00:53:48,155 --> 00:53:48,416
[SPEAKER_02]: Go ahead.

765
00:53:48,556 --> 00:53:49,536
[SPEAKER_02]: One last story for tonight.

766
00:53:52,537 --> 00:54:09,565
[SPEAKER_02]: Kata Takahashi, who created Katamari Damacy, gave an interview with the BBC this week and said that he probably doesn't really want to be doing gaming for the rest of his life.

767
00:54:09,705 --> 00:54:13,267
[SPEAKER_02]: He's actually imagining developing a playground for children.

768
00:54:14,238 --> 00:54:18,539
[SPEAKER_02]: So he's not really into doing video games for the rest of his life.

769
00:54:18,579 --> 00:54:27,162
[SPEAKER_02]: But I'm just reminded of how Kojima always says he's not going to do another Metal Gear Solid and then the next year, oh, just kidding, here's another one.

770
00:54:28,462 --> 00:54:28,782
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

771
00:54:29,482 --> 00:54:37,464
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we should be forcing him to stay on video games because I'm kind of afraid this will kind of plague around equipment he's going to come up with.

772
00:54:38,585 --> 00:54:42,686
[SPEAKER_01]: God damn, I mean, we don't actually need a physical Katamari out there.

773
00:54:42,746 --> 00:54:42,886
[SPEAKER_01]: It's

774
00:54:43,578 --> 00:54:44,179
[SPEAKER_01]: That's scary.

775
00:54:44,760 --> 00:54:46,984
[SPEAKER_02]: That's it.

776
00:54:47,024 --> 00:54:47,645
[SPEAKER_02]: That's all from me.

777
00:54:47,665 --> 00:54:48,106
[SPEAKER_02]: Anything else?

778
00:54:48,206 --> 00:54:49,208
[SPEAKER_02]: Any last minute stories, Loki?

779
00:54:49,628 --> 00:54:50,330
[SPEAKER_01]: I got nothing.

780
00:54:50,810 --> 00:54:52,814
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to be more of the same next week, I'm sure.

781
00:54:53,074 --> 00:54:55,499
[SPEAKER_01]: More games, more fun, more drama.

782
00:54:55,599 --> 00:54:56,039
[SPEAKER_02]: Can't wait.

783
00:54:57,577 --> 00:54:58,418
[SPEAKER_02]: We got a fun month ahead.

784
00:54:58,438 --> 00:55:01,158
[SPEAKER_02]: The next six weeks are going to be a blast because we got the holiday season.

785
00:55:01,178 --> 00:55:02,819
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, it's going to be insane.

786
00:55:03,099 --> 00:55:04,280
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know what?

787
00:55:04,480 --> 00:55:11,402
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually signed on to Final Fantasy XI to update it, and that's about it.

788
00:55:11,422 --> 00:55:14,663
[SPEAKER_01]: And I looked at the date that I last played it five months ago.

789
00:55:15,423 --> 00:55:17,864
[SPEAKER_02]: And you've been paying, let's see, five times.

790
00:55:17,884 --> 00:55:18,925
[SPEAKER_02]: How much do you pay him on?

791
00:55:18,945 --> 00:55:20,245
[SPEAKER_02]: $12.95 or do you have another character?

792
00:55:20,265 --> 00:55:20,985
[SPEAKER_02]: I have another character.

793
00:55:21,005 --> 00:55:21,606
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, so you paid $13.95, $14.95.

794
00:55:21,666 --> 00:55:22,406
[SPEAKER_02]: You paid $70 for nothing.

795
00:55:26,027 --> 00:55:27,328
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure the fiancé is very pleased.

796
00:55:28,608 --> 00:55:29,048
[SPEAKER_02]: Whatever.

797
00:55:29,248 --> 00:55:30,589
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I really don't care.

798
00:55:31,149 --> 00:55:31,929
[SPEAKER_01]: I will play.

799
00:55:32,230 --> 00:55:33,730
[SPEAKER_01]: I will play by the end of this month.

800
00:55:34,611 --> 00:55:35,411
[SPEAKER_01]: Mark my words.

801
00:55:38,192 --> 00:55:39,352
[SPEAKER_02]: I played World of Warcraft yesterday.

802
00:55:40,113 --> 00:55:40,953
[SPEAKER_01]: I just don't have time.

803
00:55:41,013 --> 00:55:44,294
[SPEAKER_01]: I have certain games I have to play during the week.

804
00:55:44,314 --> 00:55:45,715
[SPEAKER_01]: I have to play like everything comes out.

805
00:55:45,955 --> 00:55:46,675
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, you poor thing.

806
00:55:46,735 --> 00:55:47,876
[SPEAKER_01]: Having to play video games.

807
00:55:48,036 --> 00:55:49,136
[SPEAKER_01]: I have Ninja Turtles.

808
00:55:49,637 --> 00:55:50,437
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't played that yet.

809
00:55:51,654 --> 00:55:53,115
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, maybe we'll hear a review on that next week.

810
00:55:53,435 --> 00:55:54,675
[SPEAKER_02]: For now, that's the show.

811
00:55:54,695 --> 00:55:55,516
[SPEAKER_02]: We're pushing an hour.

812
00:55:55,576 --> 00:55:56,016
[SPEAKER_02]: We're done.

813
00:55:56,436 --> 00:55:57,236
[SPEAKER_02]: That's it for tonight's show.

814
00:55:57,296 --> 00:55:58,757
[SPEAKER_02]: Next week, we'll have MiniHead on the show.

815
00:55:58,777 --> 00:55:59,697
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to ask him questions.

816
00:55:59,717 --> 00:56:00,357
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll be a good time.

817
00:56:01,438 --> 00:56:02,698
[SPEAKER_02]: Final thoughts, Loki?

818
00:56:03,559 --> 00:56:06,620
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope Mario Kart DS is going to friggin' rock.

819
00:56:07,740 --> 00:56:09,981
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, that's my exact same final thought.

820
00:56:10,021 --> 00:56:16,163
[SPEAKER_02]: Mario Kart DS, please, dear Nintendo, please do not screw up your online capabilities.

821
00:56:16,383 --> 00:56:17,784
[SPEAKER_02]: But I have faith it's going to work.

822
00:56:18,123 --> 00:56:20,428
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's going to be an exciting era for the DS.

823
00:56:20,448 --> 00:56:23,013
[SPEAKER_01]: Then Animal Crossing DS in a few weeks after that.

824
00:56:23,634 --> 00:56:24,015
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right.

825
00:56:25,438 --> 00:56:28,200
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you so much for listening to and supporting Orange Lounge Radio.

[SPEAKER_02]: We're loving that.

828
00:56:35,226 --> 00:56:38,108
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got some great people, some just intelligent, intelligent posters.

829
00:56:38,669 --> 00:56:38,989
[SPEAKER_02]: Love it.

830
00:56:39,670 --> 00:56:41,591
[SPEAKER_02]: Keep it up with the forums over there.

831
00:56:41,992 --> 00:56:49,958
[SPEAKER_02]: And, of course, tell a friend because that's really the way the word gets out about us because we're independent and that's how folks are going to find out about us is if you tell them.

832
00:56:49,998 --> 00:56:51,099
[SPEAKER_02]: So spread the word.

833
00:56:51,679 --> 00:56:53,461
[SPEAKER_02]: Until next week, have a good one.

834
00:56:55,197 --> 00:56:58,744
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the end of another Orange Lounge Radio To Go edition.

835
00:56:59,085 --> 00:57:04,595
[SPEAKER_00]: This podcast is a proud part of www.orangeloungeradio.com.

836
00:57:05,096 --> 00:57:06,058
