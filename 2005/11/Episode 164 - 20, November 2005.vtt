00:00.000 --> 00:05.500
Lost a dream or two, found a trail

00:05.500 --> 00:08.500
And at the end was you

00:08.500 --> 00:11.500
There's a path you take and it might not take

00:11.500 --> 00:14.500
The choice is up to you my friend

00:14.500 --> 00:17.500
A night so long but you might awake

00:17.500 --> 00:20.500
To a brand new life, a brand new life

00:20.500 --> 00:24.500
A brand new life goes round to me

00:50.500 --> 01:00.500
Hello everybody.

01:00.500 --> 01:08.080
You are listening to Orange Lounge Radio tonight on episode number 164.

01:08.080 --> 01:12.700
We got a lot of stuff planned including songs from Ultramix 3.

01:12.700 --> 01:16.740
We're going to be talking a whole lot about the Ultramix 3 tonight plus Orange Lounge

01:16.740 --> 01:19.140
Radio goes to the movies again to look at ourselves.

01:19.140 --> 01:23.940
Uh, well, at least Loki and Dark Sakura, because we haven't done that yet, because we weren't here last week!

01:23.940 --> 01:27.140
So we're back from our vacation, and we're ready to kick some butt!

01:27.140 --> 01:29.140
We'll be back after this.

01:57.140 --> 02:04.140
that.

02:27.140 --> 02:31.140
Orange, man, you're itty on the line.

02:31.140 --> 02:34.140
This mommy talks radio.

02:34.140 --> 02:37.140
Oh my god.

02:39.140 --> 02:40.140
Oh god.

02:40.140 --> 02:43.140
Heh heh heh heh. Call me daddy.

02:44.140 --> 02:48.140
Orange Lounge may contain adult content.

02:48.140 --> 02:53.140
Orange Lounge may contain many four-letter words.

02:53.140 --> 02:56.140
Orange Lounge may contain a scene of nudity.

02:56.140 --> 03:00.040
The Orange Lounge takes a plenty of...

03:00.040 --> 03:02.640
...muh...muh...cawkey.

03:02.640 --> 03:07.640
Just kidding, Orange Lounge Radio will not contain any of that in this episode.

03:07.640 --> 03:09.640
Why isn't that special?

03:13.640 --> 03:24.640
Orange Lounge Radio Live is a fully interactive program via our website at www.orangelaungeradio.com.

03:24.640 --> 03:32.640
And now, here are your hosts for Orange Lounge Radio Live, Dark Sakura, Skye and Loki.

03:36.640 --> 03:45.640
We are live! And this is episode number 164 for this November the 20th of 2005.

03:45.640 --> 03:51.640
Hey guys! It's 20 November! Get it? Get it? Get it?

03:51.640 --> 03:58.160
Your home for all the news and discussion on rhythm and music games as well as the gamer

03:58.160 --> 04:00.560
community and the pop culture world.

04:00.560 --> 04:06.920
We're plugged in and fully interactive through our website at www.orangeloungeradio.com.

04:06.920 --> 04:09.000
My name is Rob Roberts, you might know me as Sky.

04:09.000 --> 04:12.280
Joining me as always are my awesome co-hosts in this corner, the happiest bunny on the

04:12.280 --> 04:13.280
farm, DarkSakura.

04:13.280 --> 04:16.320
Wait a minute, actually, just kidding.

04:16.320 --> 04:21.320
She is actually, actually she might be, hold on.

04:21.320 --> 04:24.440
Let's try this again, in this corner, DarkSakura.

04:26.680 --> 04:27.520
Can she hear me?

04:27.520 --> 04:28.340
Hello?

04:29.580 --> 04:32.760
We're trying to bring DarkSakura in on Skype tonight.

04:32.760 --> 04:33.600
Are you there?

04:35.400 --> 04:37.280
I thought we had her for a minute.

04:37.280 --> 04:39.800
Whoa, she's really, really broken up.

04:39.800 --> 04:40.780
I don't know what's going on there.

04:40.780 --> 04:41.840
That's a little weird.

04:43.960 --> 04:46.680
This is gonna be one of those nights, kids.

04:46.680 --> 04:48.840
We'll try to get DarkSakura back on the line in a little bit

04:48.840 --> 04:49.800
but she is gonna be joining us.

04:49.800 --> 04:52.800
Unfortunately, she is very, very ill right now.

04:52.800 --> 04:53.640
I don't know what happened.

04:53.640 --> 04:55.300
She caught something at the podcast for it.

04:55.300 --> 04:57.800
Adam Curry gave her something, apparently.

04:57.800 --> 04:59.600
No, actually, I don't want to make light of it.

04:59.600 --> 05:00.440
She's very sick.

05:00.440 --> 05:03.900
And she'll try to be calling in over the Skype line tonight

05:03.900 --> 05:05.520
because she misses you guys and wants to say hello.

05:05.520 --> 05:07.860
But she is in our chat room at orange-rated.com.

05:07.860 --> 05:08.880
Click on chat.

05:08.880 --> 05:10.260
Meanwhile, here in studio,

05:10.260 --> 05:12.660
we have the one and only Tech Master, Loki.

05:12.660 --> 05:13.500
Hello.

05:13.500 --> 05:14.960
Howdy.

05:14.960 --> 05:16.420
Hi.

05:16.420 --> 05:19.860
And we also have with us, uh, say hello to DDR Angel.

05:19.860 --> 05:20.580
Hello.

05:20.580 --> 05:21.420
Hi.

05:21.420 --> 05:22.340
It's working, how you doing?

05:22.340 --> 05:22.840
Yay!

05:22.840 --> 05:23.340
Alright.

05:23.340 --> 05:24.020
Good.

05:24.020 --> 05:24.980
Good!

05:24.980 --> 05:28.540
And over there, we have Xtopher.

05:28.540 --> 05:29.780
Well, hello there!

05:29.780 --> 05:30.280
Hello!

05:30.280 --> 05:31.300
What's this doing there, Ron?

05:31.300 --> 05:33.100
Hello!

05:33.100 --> 05:34.220
Well, hello!

05:34.220 --> 05:37.060
Alright.

05:37.060 --> 05:38.300
Alright, anyway.

05:38.300 --> 05:40.180
Oh, also, Bugs! Bugs is here!

05:40.180 --> 05:41.380
Playing the sick person, is that right?

05:41.380 --> 05:43.900
How are you doing? Actually, uh, DarkStalker wins that.

05:43.900 --> 05:45.580
She has, like, pneumonia.

05:45.580 --> 05:49.100
yeah it's crazy so but i don't remember what it feels like i've been sick for

05:49.100 --> 05:51.580
two years so yeah i've been sick for two years yeah

05:51.580 --> 05:54.620
that's a lot of echinacea no i had a throat surgery two years ago that

05:54.620 --> 05:57.980
removed basically everything out of the throat

05:57.980 --> 06:02.300
weird and i don't snore all right all right

06:02.300 --> 06:05.500
anyway kids what we're going to do um since it is a

06:05.500 --> 06:10.140
very special day here uh in the balani world we're going to start off tonight

06:10.140 --> 06:12.460
by taking a real quick break to bring you

06:12.460 --> 06:14.380
song and

06:14.380 --> 06:17.300
We'll come back and we're gonna get into some music from Ultramix 3 as well

06:17.300 --> 06:22.340
But of course because it is 20 November, you know, we have to start off tonight with this song. So here it is

06:22.340 --> 06:29.340
is 20 November and we'll be back right after this.

06:52.340 --> 06:59.340
Come on, shake it love, you can, don't be angry all night long, let's get heavy, calm down, now how can you feel, I just wanna hear you speak, all night long.

07:22.340 --> 07:27.340
All I know is you never let me down

07:27.340 --> 07:32.340
Down, down

07:32.340 --> 07:37.340
That gave it to me good

07:37.340 --> 07:46.260
All right, we're back here on Orange Lounge Radio.

07:46.260 --> 07:47.700
We're going to get into some music, though.

07:47.700 --> 07:51.220
Now, see, that was just a special thing, because it is 20 November, we have to, and we will

07:51.220 --> 07:55.260
give a happy belated 19 November later in the show, but since it is kind of the Bemani

07:55.260 --> 07:56.940
holiday, I have no idea why.

07:56.940 --> 07:58.460
Well, I do know why.

07:58.460 --> 08:02.700
It's this big, stupid thing that everybody, you know, recognizes in the scene, so whatever.

08:02.700 --> 08:03.700
There you go.

08:03.700 --> 08:08.040
Okay, so we're gonna get into some music though from Ultramix 3 and I'll tell you what first thing

08:08.040 --> 08:14.160
I'm gonna say about Ultramix 3 before we even really get into the show. It's got a very interesting song list a very

08:16.280 --> 08:24.180
Special song list if you will it's it's definitely diverse. We'll give it that so we're gonna be playing like special school bus

08:24.820 --> 08:27.240
Yeah, the helmet special. It's all kinds of special

08:27.240 --> 08:32.080
So we will be playing music from Ultramix 3 throughout tonight's show for you guys and you be the judge

08:32.080 --> 08:35.400
We're going to play the good stuff and the bad stuff and the downright ugly stuff.

08:35.400 --> 08:39.400
We're going to play it all tonight, and the stuff that you guys like we'll keep in rotation

08:39.400 --> 08:42.840
on our Bomani Music Award, but the stuff that's just like, what the fuck?

08:42.840 --> 08:45.920
We will get rid of and never play again.

08:45.920 --> 08:51.180
All right, so in this break we're going to start off, we're going to play in this break

08:51.180 --> 08:53.440
a track by Orifiz with Basile.

08:53.440 --> 08:57.040
They were in the last UltraMix game, so this should be interesting.

08:57.040 --> 08:59.080
We're going to play a song called Come With Me.

08:59.080 --> 09:01.160
It's not the same one from the V-Rare, though.

09:01.160 --> 09:04.920
by Yehill and Tammy, so it's the other Come With Me we're gonna play in this

09:04.920 --> 09:08.760
break, and then we're gonna play Black Eyed Peas. Black Eyed Peas have a

09:08.760 --> 09:12.800
brand new song in this Ultra Mix, so check this out. Actually it's not really

09:12.800 --> 09:16.120
a brand new, it's actually an old-ass Black Eyed Peas song, but it's new for us

09:16.120 --> 09:19.680
in DDR, and for somebody who doesn't really listen to pop radio like me, it

09:19.680 --> 09:23.480
was a brand new song. Thank God it's not my humps.

09:23.480 --> 09:27.600
All right, we're gonna check out these songs. We'll be right back with more

09:27.600 --> 09:29.600
More Orange Lounge Radio after this.

09:57.600 --> 10:02.600
Let's go, get your mind on it!

10:05.600 --> 10:07.600
Shall we dance?

10:11.600 --> 10:14.600
Let's go, get your mind on it!

10:14.600 --> 10:29.600
I can make him nothing

10:29.600 --> 10:36.600
I can make him nothing

10:36.600 --> 10:43.600
Shall we dance?

10:43.600 --> 10:53.600
Shall we dance?

10:53.600 --> 10:54.600
Shall we dance?

10:54.600 --> 10:59.600
I'd spend on nothing I'd like to do

11:24.600 --> 11:50.320
I see you passing all the time, I like your face, I like your style, the way you move,

11:50.320 --> 11:56.320
I think it's cool, go take my hand And let's just move

11:57.320 --> 12:04.320
Come with me, come with me To the place we can run free

12:04.320 --> 12:11.320
Come with me, come with me To the place we can run free

12:11.320 --> 12:26.320
Come with me, come with me Come with me to the place we can be free

12:56.320 --> 13:23.280
I got a 1990 style and a 1990 crew For everything I do, I do just for you

13:23.280 --> 13:28.280
I'm a little bit to old and a bigger bit to new Never cease, we never die, no, we never

13:28.280 --> 13:31.080
decease We multiply like we mathematicians

13:31.080 --> 13:37.880
The kongbama, the bass drum drummers Who we are, we the stars

13:37.880 --> 13:44.080
Steady rockin' all of y'all's boulevards And lookin' hard without bodyguards

13:44.080 --> 13:49.880
What I can, still I am And still I stand with steel mic in hand

13:49.880 --> 13:51.880
So come on mamma, then see the drummer

13:51.880 --> 13:52.380
Hey mama

13:52.380 --> 13:54.880
Get a blast master, Dr. Jammer

13:54.880 --> 13:56.380
Hey so shake ya bum, mama

13:56.380 --> 13:57.380

13:57.380 --> 13:59.880

14:00.380 --> 14:02.880
But the race is not for the rich

14:03.380 --> 14:05.380
But for who can heat over it

14:05.380 --> 14:09.380
And give Hari and the block, I please will be there

14:09.380 --> 14:16.380
Chill infinity! Chill infinity! Chill infinity! Chill infinity! Chill infinity!

14:16.380 --> 14:30.380
Orange Lounge Radio, we put your thing down, flip it and reverse it.

14:30.380 --> 14:40.380
Hi kiddies, welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio, here on this lovely Sunday evening,

14:40.380 --> 14:41.380
20 November!

14:41.380 --> 14:42.380
Holla!

14:42.380 --> 14:47.380
All right, also, we're joined by more special guests, I'm so excited, I love having special

14:47.380 --> 14:49.500
guests in the studio, it's so exciting.

14:49.500 --> 14:55.900
We have Mel B over here, with no microphone, low-key, let's get on that, sharing the mic

14:55.900 --> 14:56.900
thing.

14:56.900 --> 14:57.900
Mel, how you doing?

14:57.900 --> 15:01.460
Doing great, it's 20 November, and hey, what's a party without Melvis in the house?

15:01.460 --> 15:02.460
Oh, that's right.

15:02.460 --> 15:04.580
Now, how have things been with you?

15:04.580 --> 15:10.100
Things have been pretty super, I mean, just personally things, pretty hectic, just with

15:10.100 --> 15:13.740
the whole work stuff going on, kind of promoted at work.

15:13.740 --> 15:16.180
Now just so people know, you don't work at Konami anymore?

15:16.180 --> 15:17.180
Nah, nah.

15:17.180 --> 15:20.860
So if I razz on some things about UltraMix 3 tonight, you're not to blame for any of

15:20.860 --> 15:21.860
that?

15:21.860 --> 15:25.140
I will laugh along with you, likely.

15:25.140 --> 15:29.340
Alright, what's this Konami shirt you're sporting tonight now?

15:29.340 --> 15:34.020
Oh, it's a black t-shirt for those of you out there listening, it's a black t-shirt

15:34.020 --> 15:39.060
that has the old Konami standard font logo on the back, it says Bimani, it actually has

15:39.060 --> 15:43.620
the URL, I think it's like konami-arcade.com.

15:43.620 --> 15:46.940
That's old school, because now they've got that music in every direction thing, that's

15:46.940 --> 15:48.800
an old, konami.com-arcade.

15:48.800 --> 15:53.680
You know what I hear, and I'm okay to say this I think, because the website's up and

15:53.680 --> 15:58.300
it's public, I don't know if you guys have seen this, konamistyle.net, they're launching

15:58.300 --> 16:02.180
some US version of Konami style.

16:02.180 --> 16:05.140
I've heard intimations about it, I can't say much about it.

16:05.140 --> 16:09.700
I don't know how much I might have said too much, but it's out there publicly anybody can find it

16:09.700 --> 16:16.800
So it's it's there. It's gonna launch soon. So yeah, I've heard you know, I've talked to people within the company about it

16:16.800 --> 16:20.460
But you know, I don't think that anyone else couldn't speculate on me on the down low

16:20.460 --> 16:25.800
I know I got what I got noses out there on there in every direction finding this stuff out. It's all good

16:25.800 --> 16:31.180
Yeah, the cool thing actually just back on t-shirt real quick. This is actually the first prize ever won in a DDR tournament

16:31.180 --> 16:36.820
It was the item to freestyle back in SoCal, I think it was 2000 Santa Monica Pier Tourney,

16:36.820 --> 16:40.880
and there were only like three t-shirts given out, and I think overall, of people I know

16:40.880 --> 16:42.500
in the community, there are only like five.

16:42.500 --> 16:43.500
Wow.

16:43.500 --> 16:44.500
Awesome.

16:44.500 --> 16:46.740
Yeah, I'm one of the special Fab Five.

16:46.740 --> 16:52.580
Now, I have to ask you really quickly before we get into the other stuff in the show, did

16:52.580 --> 16:54.580
you listen to this week's podcast that we do?

16:54.580 --> 16:56.900
Yes, as a matter of fact, I did.

16:56.900 --> 17:01.740
What did you think about, now we, somebody, one of our listeners wrote us an email about,

17:01.740 --> 17:06.340
wanting to know about Dan's, Dan's documentary, which we later found out, you can't get a

17:06.340 --> 17:09.940
copy of it, it's not out on DVD, it was just screened at a couple film festivals, that

17:09.940 --> 17:11.740
poor guy's out of luck.

17:11.740 --> 17:14.740
But one thing that we mentioned on there is that you can actually see the movie on internet

17:14.740 --> 17:20.300
movie database and, ba-doom, you got your own internet movie database page.

17:20.300 --> 17:25.340
I had no idea, I mean, people talk about being, you know, some sort of internet celebrity

17:25.340 --> 17:30.080
whatever but being on IMDB that's a whole different sort of freaky

17:30.080 --> 17:34.080
and they still can't even spell my last name wrong. Is your last name spelled wrong on there?

17:34.080 --> 17:38.240
Yes I do not have an H in my last name. I don't know why people assume there is

17:38.240 --> 17:39.320
but

17:39.320 --> 17:40.200
uh...

17:40.200 --> 17:43.360
Anyway I wrote to them and you know hopefully they'll fix it. Alright we'll see.

17:43.360 --> 17:48.640
Alright awesome. And of course Sharks Girl Melody is here tonight. How you doing?

17:48.640 --> 17:51.940
Uh... I'm alive. Are you happy that your sharks are playing again?

17:51.940 --> 17:55.300
Kind of. I'd like them to be winning a little more.

17:55.300 --> 17:58.340
But at least it's going on. They're here, that's the big point.

17:58.340 --> 18:01.860
Now tell us about this fundraiser you're a part of.

18:01.860 --> 18:05.780
I know this is a big part of your life lately and I'm just curious.

18:05.780 --> 18:09.260
Yeah, I decided in...

18:09.260 --> 18:12.380
Well, I decided in May actually that I was going to look into joining the

18:12.380 --> 18:16.700
team in training through the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society to walk a marathon.

18:16.700 --> 18:21.180
And at that point in time, I was literally waiting for E3, the day of the

18:21.180 --> 18:25.500
meeting and things weren't working out time wise, so I thought, okay, I'll join the fall

18:25.500 --> 18:26.500
season.

18:26.500 --> 18:32.740
So I went back in July and did, started training on July 31st and I've been training for a

18:32.740 --> 18:33.740
marathon.

18:33.740 --> 18:37.940
I'm going to be walking 26.2 miles, hopefully, on December 11th in Honolulu.

18:37.940 --> 18:38.940
Awesome.

18:38.940 --> 18:45.700
And I'm up to, I've raised $3,675 so far for leukemia and lymphoma in the research.

18:45.700 --> 18:46.700
Wow, that's amazing.

18:46.700 --> 18:47.700
Yeah.

18:47.700 --> 18:52.060
want to donate more because you can go above and beyond, right? Do we have a link we can

18:52.060 --> 18:53.060
give or something?

18:53.060 --> 18:55.460
Yes. I'm actually over my total, but I'm taking everything anyone's willing to give

18:55.460 --> 18:56.460
me.

18:56.460 --> 18:57.460
Absolutely, absolutely.

18:57.460 --> 19:00.060
Even if it's just a dollar or two, the best thing to do is go to livejournal.com slash

19:00.060 --> 19:05.220
user slash melathon, M-E-L-A-T-O-N. How do you spell it? It's like marathon only with

19:05.220 --> 19:06.220
mel.

19:06.220 --> 19:07.220
Melathon.

19:07.220 --> 19:09.220
I can't even think of how to spell it myself. That's kind of sad.

19:09.220 --> 19:10.220
M-E-L-A-T-H-O-N.

19:10.220 --> 19:11.220
Thank you.

19:11.220 --> 19:12.220
You're welcome.

19:12.220 --> 19:16.140
Yeah, that's pretty much been my life lately.

19:16.140 --> 19:18.520
I was supposed to walk 22 miles yesterday.

19:18.520 --> 19:25.380
I did 12 because on Tuesday I fell and ran my knee into a curb, and it's very lovely

19:25.380 --> 19:26.380
and pretty multicolors.

19:26.380 --> 19:27.380
Ouch.

19:27.380 --> 19:32.700
Yeah, it's kind of put a damper in a thing since I'm three weeks out from the marathon.

19:32.700 --> 19:34.500
Yeah, that's ouch.

19:34.500 --> 19:38.100
I've got a backup plan in place, and my coach is not that worried.

19:38.100 --> 19:41.800
Now, did you use DDR for any of your stamina training?

19:41.800 --> 19:44.700
the background that I already had because they actually yelled at me not to do anything

19:44.700 --> 19:45.700
else.

19:45.700 --> 19:46.700
Really?

19:46.700 --> 19:50.760
For fear of hurting myself, which instead I go and I walk and run into a curb.

19:50.760 --> 19:51.760
You know I had to ask.

19:51.760 --> 19:52.760
Yeah, you won't.

19:52.760 --> 19:57.080
Actually, I haven't turned on my DDR machine in two or three months.

19:57.080 --> 20:00.680
Theoretically this shows about, you know, DDR and music games and stuff, so I have to

20:00.680 --> 20:05.360
bring it up once in a while, just to interject the idea of the illusion that we actually

20:05.360 --> 20:07.080
play DDR once in a while still.

20:07.080 --> 20:08.080
There you go.

20:08.080 --> 20:11.800
But yeah, so that's been most of my life every Saturday.

20:11.800 --> 20:14.120
The most I've walked at one time is 15 miles straight,

20:14.120 --> 20:17.720
and that took about five hours, I think.

20:17.720 --> 20:19.080
Wow.

20:19.080 --> 20:21.200
I mean, heck, walking in Honolulu,

20:21.200 --> 20:22.920
that wouldn't be a problem for me.

20:22.920 --> 20:24.280
I could walk all day in Hawaii.

20:24.280 --> 20:26.520
And see, one of my things was, hey,

20:26.520 --> 20:29.360
there's a nice little store in Hawaii in Honolulu

20:29.360 --> 20:30.800
that sells lots of import games.

20:30.800 --> 20:31.920
I think I could go there.

20:31.920 --> 20:33.080
There you go.

20:33.080 --> 20:34.360
Is it on the marathon route?

20:34.360 --> 20:36.120
Wouldn't mind if you took a little detour.

20:36.120 --> 20:41.800
extra time so I need time to go shop and then say hey I want that and go back

20:41.800 --> 20:46.680
all right all right um what we're gonna do now um we're gonna try now we tried

20:46.680 --> 20:50.100
to get dark Sakura on the show in the beginning but unfortunately our Skype

20:50.100 --> 20:56.200
was going a little bit crazy so I'm going to try and get dark Sakura back on

20:56.200 --> 21:06.420
a line here so let's see if we have any luck here I gotta bring up Skype that's

21:06.420 --> 21:10.500
weird it's almost sounds like it's calling her actual phone phone let's see

21:10.500 --> 21:25.720
doo doo doo doo doo doo one ringy dingy dingy hello hello that was weird it

21:25.720 --> 21:28.040
It sounded all phantom-y when she came on.

21:28.040 --> 21:29.040
Hello?

21:29.040 --> 21:30.040
All broken up.

21:30.040 --> 21:31.040
That's weird.

21:31.040 --> 21:32.640
Do we have any other stuff going?

21:32.640 --> 21:36.120
Let me lower our bandwidth here.

21:36.120 --> 21:37.120
Live radio, everybody.

21:37.120 --> 21:38.360
This stuff happens once in a while.

21:38.360 --> 21:41.440
I'm just trying to kill any excess bandwidth we have.

21:41.440 --> 21:43.440
Can you hear us, Jamie?

21:43.440 --> 21:44.440
Yeah.

21:44.440 --> 21:46.160
Can you hear me?

21:46.160 --> 21:47.160
There.

21:47.160 --> 21:48.160
Okay.

21:48.160 --> 21:49.160
We've got her a little bit there.

21:49.160 --> 21:50.540
We just got a really bad delay there, but that's all right.

21:50.540 --> 21:52.600
We can deal with that.

21:52.600 --> 21:54.040
DarkSakura, what's going on?

21:54.040 --> 21:55.100
How are you doing?

21:55.100 --> 22:06.320
kind of sick I know but they thought it was yeah hello hi I'm what's what's

22:06.320 --> 22:13.820
going on Dark Sakura what's what just closed IRC okay they thought I had mm-hmm

22:13.820 --> 22:20.820
and it turns out to be really bad case of bronchitis oh no so I'm really sick

22:20.820 --> 22:26.580
oh gosh well I'm really sorry to see you not here tonight I was gonna I was gonna

22:26.580 --> 22:30.340
have you start us off with how was your week how was your day but I imagine I

22:30.340 --> 22:39.020
imagine it's not so great. I spent most of the week sick and I started getting better I went

22:39.020 --> 22:45.460
to the doctor on Monday and I started getting better around Wednesday

22:45.460 --> 22:51.820
Thursday and then I had a bad relapse on Friday and my boss basically sent me to

22:51.820 --> 22:58.080
the doctor right away and he x-rayed and I have some fluid in my lungs but not

22:58.080 --> 23:02.920
enough to qualify as full-blown pneumonia so they're treating me for

23:02.920 --> 23:08.160
severe bronchitis. Still either way bronchitis or pneumonia no fun at all I

23:08.160 --> 23:13.360
imagine so. I didn't play any games this week but I did watch a lot of the Muppet

23:13.360 --> 23:14.360
show

23:14.360 --> 23:17.480
well that's cool do you have a favorite episode of the Muppet Show?

23:17.480 --> 23:19.680
uh... i like the one with Twiggy

23:19.680 --> 23:23.200
and the one with Sandy Duncan

23:23.200 --> 23:30.200
that's awesome i think i think we might actually have a little mood music here

23:38.400 --> 23:42.920
see this is Jamie's week in a nutshell unfortunately is the Muppet Show here

23:42.920 --> 23:45.920
And not doing my homework until the weekend.

23:45.920 --> 23:48.920
Don't you get a buy from your homework though when you're sick?

23:48.920 --> 23:51.920
No, unfortunately.

23:51.920 --> 23:54.920
Some of my classes are online, so I don't necessarily...

23:54.920 --> 23:58.920
Your professors are evil for not letting you have a buy on your homework.

23:58.920 --> 24:03.920
One of my teachers is giving us a week off for Thanksgiving in one of my online classes.

24:03.920 --> 24:07.920
Now, what are your plans for Thanksgiving? Is this going to get in the way of Thanksgiving?

24:07.920 --> 24:15.500
I have no idea, but I'm tired of being stuck in the house, because I had to miss going to see Chemical Angel on Saturday.

24:15.500 --> 24:16.000
Uh-huh.

24:16.640 --> 24:24.120
And missing the show tonight, and I missed seeing my friend, um, one of my co-workers who moved to Delaware was in town today.

24:24.120 --> 24:24.620
Mm-hmm.

24:24.920 --> 24:26.640
And I missed my chance to see her.

24:26.640 --> 24:27.140
Mm-hmm.

24:27.600 --> 24:29.240
And we did talk on the phone for a little bit.

24:29.240 --> 24:31.040
Well, that's something, okay.

24:32.160 --> 24:35.680
But, it's just been, bleh.

24:35.680 --> 24:36.180
Well, what-

24:36.180 --> 24:38.580
I slept 13 hours yesterday.

24:38.580 --> 24:41.660
You know, I've slept a lot.

24:41.660 --> 24:43.820
I slept like 11 hours last night,

24:43.820 --> 24:45.460
and I don't have a good excuse for that.

24:45.460 --> 24:46.860
I really don't.

24:46.860 --> 24:49.940
I was sick like two weeks ago, but it was just a common cold.

24:49.940 --> 24:51.180
It was nothing major.

24:51.180 --> 24:52.860
But I don't really have a good excuse.

24:52.860 --> 24:54.620
I had a cold.

24:54.620 --> 24:56.980
This is what my cold turned into.

24:56.980 --> 24:58.540
That's sucky.

24:58.540 --> 25:01.660
When did the doctors think it would be better?

25:01.660 --> 25:04.180
Nobody put me on.

25:04.180 --> 25:08.140
I was on Keflux, which is kind of a mild antibiotic.

25:08.140 --> 25:09.860
That was for the sinus infection.

25:09.860 --> 25:11.980
And then once he found out just how bad it was,

25:11.980 --> 25:16.300
he put me on doxycycline, which is, from what I understand,

25:16.300 --> 25:18.140
supposed to be pretty hardcore stuff.

25:18.140 --> 25:19.540
Wow.

25:19.540 --> 25:22.540
Yeah, so he gave me a seven-day supply,

25:22.540 --> 25:24.340
but I'm going to see how I feel.

25:24.340 --> 25:25.540
It's helping some.

25:25.540 --> 25:26.740
I'm getting a little better.

25:26.740 --> 25:27.260
That's good.

25:27.260 --> 25:29.300
Well, I hope you get back to work tomorrow.

25:29.300 --> 25:30.020
Oh, gosh.

25:30.020 --> 25:31.980
I hope you get a lot better by Thursday.

25:31.980 --> 25:33.300
At least it's a short work week.

25:33.300 --> 25:35.740
I mean, there's something to look forward to there, a little bit.

25:35.740 --> 25:36.740
Yeah.

25:36.740 --> 25:37.740
I guess.

25:37.740 --> 25:39.220
What else was I going to ask?

25:39.220 --> 25:42.220
Oh, before, you know, we're going to go around the room and see how everybody else's weekend

25:42.220 --> 25:44.580
day was, but I wanted to ask, what were your thoughts, I know you haven't had a chance

25:44.580 --> 25:47.980
to play games, you haven't had a chance to check out Ultramix 3 yet, what do you think

25:47.980 --> 25:51.100
of the music so far, though?

25:51.100 --> 25:56.000
I wouldn't be the one to ask, I've been paying attention, I've been either passed out or

25:56.000 --> 25:57.000
doing homework.

25:57.000 --> 25:58.000
That's alright, it's understandable.

25:58.000 --> 26:01.460
Okay, well, Jamie, what we're going to do, we're going to go back around the room, we'll

26:01.460 --> 26:04.460
We'll bring you back later in the show, though, for some of our other stuff, okay?

26:04.460 --> 26:05.460
Okay.

26:05.460 --> 26:06.460
All right, take care.

26:06.460 --> 26:07.460
Rest up.

26:07.460 --> 26:08.460
All right.

26:08.460 --> 26:09.460
All right.

26:09.460 --> 26:10.460
Any final words for the listeners for right now?

26:10.460 --> 26:12.460
Send me money.

26:12.460 --> 26:13.460
Okay.

26:13.460 --> 26:14.460
We will do.

26:14.460 --> 26:15.460
Okay.

26:15.460 --> 26:16.460
All right.

26:16.460 --> 26:17.460
Bye.

26:17.460 --> 26:18.460
Bye.

26:18.460 --> 26:19.460
Bye.

26:19.460 --> 26:20.460
Bye.

26:20.460 --> 26:21.460
All right.

26:21.460 --> 26:22.460
We'll bring her back on the show a little later.

26:22.460 --> 26:25.900
She feels bad because she wasn't here last week and she's been out, but obviously she's

26:25.900 --> 26:29.460
got to rest up, so we hope she gets better very soon.

26:29.460 --> 26:33.460
Well, let's go around the room and see how other folks are having their day and their week.

26:33.460 --> 26:38.460
We'll start with Angel, because she's over there just lounging around there with the microphone ready to go.

26:38.460 --> 26:41.460
What's up? How was your day?

26:41.460 --> 26:47.460
Good. I did something I said I wasn't going to do, and you're going to laugh now.

26:47.460 --> 26:48.460
What's that?

26:48.460 --> 26:51.460
I rolled Alliance.

26:51.460 --> 26:54.460
Wait. Oh, you joined an alliance on World of Warcraft?

26:54.460 --> 26:58.460
I rolled Alliance. Yeah, I rolled Alliance character on a different server.

26:58.460 --> 27:10.460
server. Oh, okay. What server? Uh, Malfurion. Okay. Um, it's me. Okay. Okay. He's never

27:10.460 --> 27:17.460
gonna laugh. Oh, yeah. Well, anyway. I told everyone I wasn't gonna do it. Careful, that

27:17.460 --> 27:21.060
microphone's the weird one. You gotta make sure you're, yeah, it's weird. It doesn't

27:21.060 --> 27:27.780
like me there you go there you go yay yay for wiring okay so um yeah so I

27:27.780 --> 27:32.700
said I wasn't gonna do it and then I did so I don't know everything's weird now

27:32.700 --> 27:37.140
because I'm so used to like playing chord and stuff so you're having to play

27:37.140 --> 27:45.180
as the bad guy well actually yeah what else you've been playing this week not

27:45.180 --> 27:52.980
World of Warcraft but oh yeah guitar hero because I just got that tool yeah

27:52.980 --> 27:57.860
how's guitar hero working out for you uh sometimes the notes go too fast but if I

27:57.860 --> 28:03.420
concentrate on what what's going where everything's cool so what else do we get

28:03.420 --> 28:08.220
this week what do you think about guitar hero compared to guitar freaks um I

28:08.220 --> 28:12.900
haven't I didn't get to play guitar freaks that much because you know when I

28:12.900 --> 28:17.340
first started coming up here and stuff with you guys. The machines were always broken,

28:17.340 --> 28:23.980
so don't! So, like, whenever you, you know, you guys played it for me or whatever, it

28:23.980 --> 28:30.980
was really neat to watch. But this one's got its kicks and fun stuff too. We also have

28:30.980 --> 28:37.260
Path of Neo in the house. So I've been watching Andrew play that, and all is good. But I still

28:37.260 --> 28:41.260
like my World of Warcraft. Have you been on Mario Kart Frenzy this week? Yes. Yeah? Yes,

28:41.260 --> 28:49.880
I got to play with Slinky, and Big Run Pimp, and DJ Runway S, and you know, all of my buddies.

28:49.880 --> 28:50.880
It's fun.

28:50.880 --> 28:51.880
The online thing is crazy, isn't it?

28:51.880 --> 28:52.880
Yes, it is.

28:52.880 --> 28:53.880
And there's no lag.

28:53.880 --> 28:54.880
At least I don't think.

28:54.880 --> 28:55.880
Is there lag?

28:55.880 --> 28:56.880
No, not really.

28:56.880 --> 28:57.880
I don't notice it.

28:57.880 --> 28:58.880
Yeah.

28:58.880 --> 28:59.880
I think it's great.

28:59.880 --> 29:04.120
So, I've been doing a lot of gaming this week, when I should be concentrating on school,

29:04.120 --> 29:06.000
which I'm doing too.

29:06.000 --> 29:08.160
But gaming's much more fun.

29:08.160 --> 29:09.160
Especially this week.

29:09.160 --> 29:12.860
such a big week with all the releases that came out last week. All the games. Going into

29:12.860 --> 29:18.720
next week and the 360 and all that crap. I don't even have a PSP yet. Oh well. Soon.

29:18.720 --> 29:27.480
Anything else? No. Alright. I don't think so. I feel like a bat. It's so comfortable

29:27.480 --> 29:31.300
when you're lying there to just be able to go to sleep, so. Be careful. Stay awake and

29:31.300 --> 29:33.480
alert, because you'll never know when there might be a fire in the house or something.

29:33.480 --> 29:35.880
You won't want to sleep through that. I'll be like, Angel, wake up! Hitting me with a

29:35.880 --> 29:40.880
Alright, Mel, I see you got a microphone. How was your week? How was your day?

29:40.880 --> 29:47.880
Um, week's been pretty nuts with work. Like, I've been totally, been sent on totally different assignments.

29:47.880 --> 29:55.880
Now normally, like, I do editing and stuff for tests. Now I've actually been assigned to help create tests for visually impaired people.

29:55.880 --> 29:59.880
So, like, things I have to learn is I actually have to learn, like, some basic Braille.

29:59.880 --> 30:02.880
Huh. Or you have to learn to write really big.

30:02.880 --> 30:09.320
Yeah, actually instead of that what we do is like I write audio scripts for stuff like say for a math problem

30:09.320 --> 30:13.080
There's like a drawing of a triangle which is like, you know, four or five, you know

30:13.080 --> 30:18.560
Whatever the Pythagorean triple is but the thing is of course obviously a blind person can't see that and you know

30:18.560 --> 30:21.560
You can't really make like a raised diagram for them to feel around

30:21.560 --> 30:25.560
So you actually have to write the description like there is a triangle ABC

30:25.720 --> 30:31.960
You know B is a right angle and you know side AB equals four and BC equals five, you know by that large hard

30:31.960 --> 30:35.020
It's so hard to do and he can't see.

30:35.020 --> 30:38.440
It's really like a kind of a crash course in articulation and like basically you're

30:38.440 --> 30:41.480
kind of thinking, well if someone was from another planet, how would you describe all

30:41.480 --> 30:42.480
this stuff to them?

30:42.480 --> 30:43.480
So it's...

30:43.480 --> 30:46.280
How would you describe DDR to somebody who is visually impaired?

30:46.280 --> 30:47.280
Let's see.

30:47.280 --> 30:48.280
A lost cause.

30:48.280 --> 30:49.280
Let's see.

30:49.280 --> 30:50.280
Let's see.

30:50.280 --> 30:51.280
Okay.

30:51.280 --> 30:54.940
There is loud Japanese Eurobeat music playing.

30:54.940 --> 30:59.060
There are arrows slowly crawling up the screen.

30:59.060 --> 31:03.740
But if you're visually impaired, how do you know what an arrow is?

31:03.740 --> 31:04.740
Easy, Paul!

31:04.740 --> 31:05.740
The break!

31:05.740 --> 31:14.100
There is somebody dancing on a pad with arrows and the pad lights up when they step on it.

31:14.100 --> 31:20.180
This person looks really gay playing this game.

31:20.180 --> 31:21.180
Shut up, Rob!

31:21.180 --> 31:27.740
This person is holding on to a bar that is pink in color with a black top that has since

31:27.740 --> 31:39.020
been ripped off by little six-year-old shits at Golf Land. Anyway, sorry about that. What

31:39.020 --> 31:40.020
else is going on in your world?

31:40.020 --> 31:46.500
Oh, let's see. All that boring stuff aside. What else? I guess as far as gaming, I've

31:46.500 --> 31:51.860
been playing, got a couple of new games that I've been into this week. Let's see, Smackdown

31:51.860 --> 31:58.580
versus raw 2006 for PS2. Doesn't this have a Barbie mode in it where you can make your

31:58.580 --> 32:03.660
own wrestlers? Oh actually the create a wrestler mode has been around since like I think a

32:03.660 --> 32:09.020
couple versions ago but this time they've gotten even more detailed with things like

32:09.020 --> 32:13.380
you know this time you can customize your entrance like you know different types of

32:13.380 --> 32:17.060
you can have like fireworks go off you know at certain points or you can like have the

32:17.060 --> 32:20.900
camera pan around to someone else or, you know, all sorts of...

32:20.900 --> 32:21.900
That's great.

32:21.900 --> 32:24.500
You can do the techno, you know, lighting, all sorts of things.

32:24.500 --> 32:28.940
The game makes you spend like an hour coming up with a perfect introduction and like no

32:28.940 --> 32:29.940
time on the actual...

32:29.940 --> 32:33.220
I'll put it like this, when I was making my first character it took me about three and

32:33.220 --> 32:34.220
a half hours.

32:34.220 --> 32:35.220
Oh my god.

32:35.220 --> 32:39.180
You know, that's, but that's because not only are you making the character but because it's

32:39.180 --> 32:43.100
a new game you want to see what new types of hairstyles or like clothes you can put

32:43.100 --> 32:44.100
on people.

32:44.100 --> 32:47.700
It's just exploration really, but it's still pretty damn fun.

32:47.700 --> 32:52.240
That's kind of like Soul Calibur 3 has a make a fighter mode. It's pretty

32:52.240 --> 32:55.680
pretty intensive too. But you don't get to do your intro, which is too

32:55.680 --> 32:59.320
bad because Soul Calibur 3 practically has wrestling intros where it's like

32:59.320 --> 33:04.320
the soul will burn as two entrants come for the next battle.

33:04.320 --> 33:09.040
I shall destroy you with every inch of my being!

33:09.040 --> 33:15.040
Do we have to fight now? Let there be a great battle!

33:15.040 --> 33:20.040
I swear to god, like SoulCalibur goes on and on with like the setups of these fights.

33:20.040 --> 33:27.040
Uh, Rob, you would do a good intro for the next World of Warcraft game?

33:27.040 --> 33:29.040
I should be SoulCalibur 4, it's all about me.

33:29.040 --> 33:35.040
I am the Pencils Pope, you killed my father, prefer to die!

33:35.040 --> 33:40.040
Alright. Anyway, sorry, I keep cutting you off, buddy.

33:40.040 --> 33:41.040
It's cool.

33:41.040 --> 33:47.040
But yeah, let's see, Smackdown vs. WoW is a pretty fun game. I mean, the grappling engine has been...

33:47.040 --> 33:52.040
It's a little deeper now, so there's like, kind of, you know, not only are you grabbing them, it's like, do you grab them now?

33:52.040 --> 33:57.040
Do you want to, like, throw them, you know, outside the ring, or do you want to just, you know, give them a love tap?

33:57.040 --> 34:01.040
There's like six million different ways to go. It's like a choose your own adventure book with grappling now.

34:01.040 --> 34:07.040
But it's still pretty cool. I think the most fun though is just creating the characters and like, you know, making mockeries of all your friends.

34:07.040 --> 34:09.040
You know, that's the fun of it.

34:09.040 --> 34:12.040
Making characters that look like your friends and then kicking the shit out of them.

34:12.040 --> 34:16.040
That's what we do essentially, everybody in like RTF and Step Squad.

34:16.040 --> 34:18.040
Yeah, we just have like these big get-togethers.

34:18.040 --> 34:23.040
I make my characters in Soul Calibur 3 look really, really faggy, like the best I get.

34:23.040 --> 34:27.040
Like I gave one a po-pat and a clown necklace and no pants.

34:27.040 --> 34:34.040
No pants. And he's wearing like a little jock strap or something where I swear you could see his ass.

34:34.040 --> 34:38.040
And it's purple. For no real reason.

34:38.040 --> 34:40.040
I gotta see those characters.

34:40.040 --> 34:43.040
That's great. I love creating a character in Soul Calibur 3.

34:43.040 --> 34:49.040
Let's see, what else? Guitar Hero obviously has been also getting a lot of play time. That's pretty fun.

34:49.040 --> 34:54.040
Yeah, those are pretty much the two main games I've been playing this week.

34:54.040 --> 34:58.040
And, yeah, everything's been a pretty good all together and today, hey, I'm here, you

34:58.040 --> 34:59.040
know?

34:59.040 --> 35:00.040
It's 20 November, ahh.

35:00.040 --> 35:01.040
Alright.

35:01.040 --> 35:04.760
Sharks Girl, how was your week, how was your day?

35:04.760 --> 35:08.680
My week has been the same as every week for the last, I don't know how many, I walked

35:08.680 --> 35:09.680
a lot.

35:09.680 --> 35:14.040
God, I've probably done over 250 miles at this point.

35:14.040 --> 35:15.040
Can't you help me, though?

35:15.040 --> 35:16.040
Oh, yeah, I have an awful lot of weight.

35:16.040 --> 35:17.040
I should be training for a marathon.

35:17.040 --> 35:18.040
Oh, it's great.

35:18.040 --> 35:24.020
But, yeah, I worked, I walked, I actually went to a store called Sur La Table, I don't

35:24.020 --> 35:26.920
know if anyone else... I don't know if it's a Bay Area thing or if it's

35:26.920 --> 35:29.760
nationwide or what but it's one of those places where it's like a cooking

35:29.760 --> 35:34.720
utensil store but they also have like a kitchen and stuff and my work hired it

35:34.720 --> 35:37.520
out and brought a bunch of people we work with in there were like 40 people

35:37.520 --> 35:41.960
there and we all drank wine and made food and it was really entertaining so

35:41.960 --> 35:46.160
and I now have a really good recipe for petite beef wellingtons if anyone wants

35:46.160 --> 35:52.000
it but yes I did that I walked aforementioned walking you know I'm very

35:52.000 --> 35:56.200
I'm very, very lucky because the one game I have been playing a lot of is Guitar Hero,

35:56.200 --> 36:00.580
and I was carrying my guitar when I fell, and I'm just lucky the back of it hit the

36:00.580 --> 36:03.920
curb and took chunks out of it versus the front or the buttons.

36:03.920 --> 36:04.920
Ooh, yeah.

36:04.920 --> 36:05.920
Yeah, so...

36:05.920 --> 36:08.860
Wait, how did you fall with a Guitar Hero controller?

36:08.860 --> 36:09.860
I was...

36:09.860 --> 36:10.860
You know I have to ask.

36:10.860 --> 36:12.560
I was holding a bunch of stuff.

36:12.560 --> 36:17.660
I was going to my car from Mel's, it was like 1130 at night, and I was wearing my heels

36:17.660 --> 36:21.240
from work, which I don't wear skinny ones, but still, they're heels.

36:21.240 --> 36:25.400
So I had my Guitar Hero controller slung around, no I was holding the neck of it in my left

36:25.400 --> 36:29.080
hand, I had my purse up there, and I was holding something else in my right hand.

36:29.080 --> 36:33.320
I stepped up on a curb and I think I stepped onto a rock and it turned out from underneath

36:33.320 --> 36:34.320
me.

36:34.320 --> 36:35.320
And I went straight down.

36:35.320 --> 36:37.180
Next thing I know I'm like, why am I on the ground?

36:37.180 --> 36:40.040
And then Mel's looking at me like, why are you on the ground?

36:40.040 --> 36:44.160
And then it hits me that the best thing to do in this situation would be curse loudly.

36:44.160 --> 36:46.160
So I did.

36:46.160 --> 36:48.640
And probably scared the shit out of the neighbors.

36:48.640 --> 36:55.280
Yeah, so, um, yeah, the Guitar Hero controller hit the ground right next to me, so I have

36:55.280 --> 36:57.840
a few little gouges out of the back of it, but it still plays.

36:57.840 --> 36:59.840
But as long as it works, that's the important part.

36:59.840 --> 37:02.840
Oh yeah, yeah, it still works, trust me.

37:02.840 --> 37:06.400
Anything else you want to share about your week and your day?

37:06.400 --> 37:08.000
Have you been doing the Mario Kart thing?

37:08.000 --> 37:09.000
No.

37:09.000 --> 37:10.000
Oh.

37:10.000 --> 37:11.000
Okay, this is when you kick me.

37:11.000 --> 37:12.000
Mario Kart case!

37:12.000 --> 37:13.000
This is when you kick me out of the house.

37:13.000 --> 37:14.000
No, I'm not going to kick you out of the house.

37:14.000 --> 37:18.120
I've never played Mario Kart ever.

37:18.120 --> 37:20.720
The look of stunned silence is amazing.

37:20.720 --> 37:22.720
I'm sorry, I just, I have to point and laugh.

37:22.720 --> 37:24.020
Mm-hmm.

37:24.020 --> 37:26.320
No, I'm just, that's, how, how did that happen?

37:26.320 --> 37:27.920
You just not interested, or?

37:27.920 --> 37:30.820
I just never, I, I just never really got into it,

37:30.820 --> 37:32.620
and none of my friends really had it,

37:32.620 --> 37:34.720
so I didn't have exposure to it that way.

37:34.720 --> 37:36.520
And now you're handing me a DS with Mario Kart?

37:36.520 --> 37:37.920
I was just telling Mel that I needed to play.

37:37.920 --> 37:38.920
Play me.

37:38.920 --> 37:40.120
Play me, Mario.

37:40.120 --> 37:42.320
His DS is telling me to play it.

37:42.320 --> 37:43.320
Play me.

37:43.320 --> 37:44.120
There you go.

37:44.120 --> 37:46.920
Actually, Mario's also sitting over there,

37:46.920 --> 37:50.240
So you can play it too?

37:50.240 --> 37:51.760
Pretty much my week has been walking,

37:51.760 --> 37:55.140
and everything is going to be walking up until December 11th,

37:55.140 --> 37:57.400
upon which at night it's party and collapse,

37:57.400 --> 37:59.800
and then it's hang out in Hawaii time.

37:59.800 --> 38:02.320
And then life returns to normal.

38:02.320 --> 38:02.840
All right.

38:02.840 --> 38:04.880
Yep, that was it.

38:04.880 --> 38:06.700
Now, what's this part about how I'm

38:06.700 --> 38:08.080
going to be joining you in Hawaii,

38:08.080 --> 38:09.960
how you actually got me a ticket and was

38:09.960 --> 38:11.920
going to surprise me on the show with it tonight?

38:11.920 --> 38:12.760
What was this about?

38:12.760 --> 38:15.720
Darn, you ruined the surprise, dammit.

38:15.720 --> 38:19.720
Maybe next year, maybe next year I'll train, but

38:19.720 --> 38:24.540
it's a lot of time. It is a lot of time, but honestly it's one of the

38:24.540 --> 38:26.680
best experiences I've ever had in my life and I'm

38:26.680 --> 38:30.760
so close with all these people I've been training with. It's a big commitment, but

38:30.760 --> 38:31.080
it's

38:31.080 --> 38:34.560
totally worth it. And if anyone wants to talk to me about it, go ahead and

38:34.560 --> 38:38.080
email me, find me. I'll put a post on Orange Land or something. Sounds good.

38:38.080 --> 38:43.720
Cool. Alright. Loki, how was your week? How was your day? My week was good until today.

38:43.720 --> 38:48.440
or actually I should say yeah yeah until about today

38:48.440 --> 38:51.960
I last week

38:51.960 --> 38:55.960
I'm because I hadn't gotten an oil change in forever I decided to go and

38:55.960 --> 38:57.520
get an oil change for my car

38:57.520 --> 39:01.880
and like luck as it would be they fucked up my car

39:01.880 --> 39:06.040
again. This isn't the same place that wrecked your old car.

39:06.040 --> 39:10.880
Different place, different car, still fucking stuff up. So now my car leaks coolant

39:10.880 --> 39:17.760
and, um, overheats thanks to them, and so now I gotta get that fixed, I gotta take work

39:17.760 --> 39:25.520
off, it's just a pain in the ass, it really is, um, however, aside from that, see, cause

39:25.520 --> 39:29.680
my whole week's been kind of doing the rollercoaster ride of highs and lows, last night we went

39:29.680 --> 39:33.520
to the strip club and that was kind of fun, just because we had titties in our face all

39:33.520 --> 39:40.520
night and, um, and lap dances, and so Nellie had a pretty good time. Um, and then, um,

39:40.520 --> 39:44.700
I don't know, that was pretty much it, yeah, that was the highlights of the week. Oh, I

39:44.700 --> 39:50.480
have Xbox 360 games and no Xbox system, and, uh, Gamestop was wonderful and decided to

39:50.480 --> 39:54.420
go ahead and sell my copy of Project Gotham Racing, even though I had a pre-order for

39:54.420 --> 40:01.000
it, and came there, showed them my receipt, and they were like, uh, oops. So. It's fucking

40:01.000 --> 40:05.800
ridiculous not nice and then I got a recorded message saying you're not going

40:05.800 --> 40:09.880
to get your system till after Christmas which you know that's based on their

40:09.880 --> 40:14.680
current allocations of what they're gonna get but it's just gonna be a big

40:14.680 --> 40:19.640
giant circus this week so I'm looking forward to completely ignoring it that's

40:19.640 --> 40:24.840
sorry I got Mario Kart I've got other games you know I could play I really

40:24.840 --> 40:28.280
don't care and if I absolutely that's my only if I can't get an Xbox 360 I'll just

40:28.280 --> 40:31.400
support other systems that have games out that I can actually get, you know.

40:31.400 --> 40:32.920
Exactly, exactly.

40:32.920 --> 40:37.480
My week in my day, not a whole lot of interest because I've just been working

40:37.480 --> 40:40.840
like just crazy. It's horrible. I've been working

40:40.840 --> 40:44.960
all the time, and

40:44.960 --> 40:48.960
outside of that I picked up a couple new games. I picked up Ultramix 3, which we're going to talk about

40:48.960 --> 40:52.840
after the next break, of course. Then I also picked up a copy of Mario Kart DS, which

40:52.840 --> 40:54.760
has, you know, been a big part of the week as well.

40:54.760 --> 40:55.920
and uh...

40:55.920 --> 40:58.280
just you know

40:58.280 --> 41:01.720
aria it's a fight in the least this is the ticket already that you said you

41:01.720 --> 41:04.080
know we can i have not

41:04.080 --> 41:07.760
read into your one i've attached world war craft in five days

41:07.760 --> 41:09.960
i thought

41:09.960 --> 41:12.820
well so that i've also taken a break from uh...

41:12.820 --> 41:16.800
uh... i i i just i've been doing a lot of like sleeping in other stuff to just

41:16.800 --> 41:19.160
his work has been that exhausting

41:19.160 --> 41:21.600
interested

41:21.600 --> 41:27.440
I was just saying, while we're on Mario Kart, I actually got to play the Mario Kart arcade version yesterday

41:27.440 --> 41:30.840
at Milpitas Golf Land. It's actually pretty fun. They got

41:30.840 --> 41:34.560
not only Nintendo, but Namco also was in on it.

41:34.560 --> 41:38.880
So now you can write as Pac-Man, Ms. Pac-Man, or Blinky. I heard about that so

41:38.880 --> 41:39.640
bad ass.

41:39.640 --> 41:44.360
So they have that at Milpitas Golf Land? Yes they do. The only thing that sucks is they don't have card readers.

41:44.360 --> 41:50.160
Aww. No! And it's like, oh, actually in a way it's bad, but it's good too because if

41:50.160 --> 41:53.520
there was a car driver would drop by twenty bucks yesterday

41:53.520 --> 41:57.360
okay so i'm going to a birthday party in hayward like in two weeks and i'm gonna

41:57.360 --> 42:00.760
have to swing by milpitas even though it's like an hour drive i don't care

42:00.760 --> 42:04.040
about how are you like this first of december something it's like a friday

42:04.040 --> 42:06.400
now the financial

42:06.400 --> 42:07.280
uh... right now

42:07.280 --> 42:11.160
going like dr i have to play i can't totally are in the power sliding isn't

42:11.160 --> 42:14.120
like totally there but you can do like jump drift

42:14.120 --> 42:16.680
so you know it's a little different but they have like all the courses there

42:16.680 --> 42:19.280
You can do the jump drifts in this to kind of use that same thing. Yeah

42:19.280 --> 42:22.040
Yeah, where you like to get to the gas and you hit the brake and then yeah

42:22.040 --> 42:25.720
You can do that sorta sorta and this one you wiggle back and forth after you do a jump. Yeah

42:25.720 --> 42:32.400
Oh, wow, kind of interesting. So anyway, alright, we're gonna go to another break. I want to talk a lot about Ultramix 3 tonight

42:32.400 --> 42:34.660
I know you guys have your opinions you want to state too

42:34.660 --> 42:37.740
We're gonna get to all of that right after this next break

42:37.740 --> 42:40.520
But we need to take a break because I need something to drink something stiff

42:41.120 --> 42:44.420
In this break, we're gonna hear some more Ultramix 3 music in this break

42:44.420 --> 42:48.800
We're gonna hear I am gothic because I love this song. Where's your head at by Basement Jacks?

42:49.420 --> 42:53.740
Nari Nari by J. Dobby. It's a little bit of a like Bollywood type

42:53.740 --> 42:59.140
It's kind of cool and then a stakeout the ultra mix by freeze pop so we're gonna hear all that this break

42:59.140 --> 43:01.460
We'll be back with more Orange on a Tradio after this.

43:29.140 --> 43:32.260
Buried in glue, I'm just now breathing

43:32.260 --> 43:36.180
I consider it true, it's a fuzzy dark country

43:36.180 --> 43:39.060
Feel my pain, all alone and safe

43:39.060 --> 43:41.060
May I still make my way?

43:41.060 --> 43:48.340
Catch the ghost race, it's the center of my heart

43:48.340 --> 43:53.380
I am hopeless, I'm found

43:53.380 --> 44:09.380
I am nothing, I am frail, I am scary, I know the same, I am a loner, I am cold, I feel

44:09.380 --> 44:19.380
special when people come close, I am nothing, I am pale, I am scary, I am insane, I am a

44:19.380 --> 44:21.380
I am your

44:21.380 --> 44:23.380
I feel essential

44:23.380 --> 44:25.380
When people come for you

44:25.380 --> 44:43.620
Where's your head at?

44:43.620 --> 44:47.620
Where's your hand at?

44:58.620 --> 45:01.620
Where's your hand at?

45:01.620 --> 45:03.620
Where's your hand at?

45:03.620 --> 45:05.620
Where's your hand at now?

45:05.620 --> 45:07.620
Drop it!

45:09.620 --> 45:11.620
Okay, are you ready?

48:11.620 --> 48:23.620
I know you work across the street in the indie breakfast store

48:23.620 --> 48:26.620
I'm thinking sometimes that won't mean I'm thinking we'll do something more

48:26.620 --> 48:29.620
I hide behind my back seat, then I see a walk on by

48:29.620 --> 48:33.620
But I'm not ready to be seen, I'll just sit right here and have a goodbye

48:46.420 --> 48:52.620
I'll take advantage of your feelings in me lately

48:52.620 --> 48:54.620
I need my time

48:55.620 --> 49:00.620
Now I know that you're with me now

49:13.620 --> 49:17.620
I must get out of college and go to school

49:47.620 --> 49:59.620
Orange Lounge Radio, Bahmani Music, and more.

49:59.620 --> 50:01.260
Perfect!

50:01.260 --> 50:04.660
We're back here on Orange Lounge Radio and on that break you heard I Am Gothic by Spray,

50:04.660 --> 50:08.460
Where's Your Head At, Basement Jaxx, which by the way has a very freaky video, it's in

50:08.460 --> 50:14.500
that mix, Nari Nariin by J. Dabi, and Stake Out, the Ultra Mix by Freeze Pop.

50:14.500 --> 50:19.100
I don't want to say too much, but please keep your fingers crossed for me.

50:19.100 --> 50:22.340
I got a contact over at Freeze Pop, and I'm trying to get them on the show.

50:22.340 --> 50:26.600
So please pray to whatever deity that we can get them on the show, because I love Freeze

50:26.600 --> 50:27.600
Pop.

50:27.600 --> 50:28.600
I would love to have them on the program.

50:28.600 --> 50:32.260
And if anybody out there from the Freeze Pop camp is listening, please come on the show!

50:32.260 --> 50:33.260
Please!

50:33.260 --> 50:34.260
You're super...

50:34.260 --> 50:35.260
Okay, so we'll see what happens.

50:35.260 --> 50:38.060
We made our freaks look so uber-chic.

50:38.060 --> 50:39.060
We shop at Target.

50:39.060 --> 50:40.060
Trust me.

50:40.060 --> 50:41.060
No, seriously.

50:41.060 --> 50:43.740
I shop so much at Target.

50:43.740 --> 50:44.740
It's disgusting.

50:44.740 --> 50:46.600
Probably this whole house is furnished with Tarjay.

50:46.600 --> 50:50.620
The thing with Tarjay that reminds me is the sad news about Vanilla Coke's passing.

50:50.620 --> 50:55.560
I can remember going to a Tarjay with you and finding every damn bottle of Vanilla Coke

50:55.560 --> 50:58.440
they had and buying it when it first came out.

50:58.440 --> 51:00.200
I have that picture in my cubicle.

51:00.200 --> 51:02.200
The picture's at work.

51:02.200 --> 51:03.200
It makes me sad.

51:03.200 --> 51:06.960
I'll have to put that next to the picture of me as a toddler with Crystal Pepsi.

51:06.960 --> 51:08.960
No, I'm kidding.

51:08.960 --> 51:09.960
Alright.

51:09.960 --> 51:10.960
Rob!

51:10.960 --> 51:11.960
What?

51:11.960 --> 51:16.960
What? I traced that stuff too. No, I know I didn't. I wasn't a toddler.

51:16.960 --> 51:21.960
That shit was that one when we were in junior high or so. They're about the same age.

51:21.960 --> 51:26.960
Don't forget I'm not that much younger than you are.

51:26.960 --> 51:31.960
Sir. I'm getting yelled at by the chat room. Chat room by the way. www.orangelambsrader.com

51:31.960 --> 51:36.960
Click on chat. MPQ says stop saying Tarjay. Hey, it's better than the new one

51:36.960 --> 51:40.220
I've started hearing recently because all my friends shop there tar gay

51:42.760 --> 51:48.980
So if you want buddy, no, all right, we all know it's target no, that's right, but but I like that target

51:48.980 --> 51:55.600
They come on. It makes it sound chic makes it sound like sax fifth tar. J. That's great. We have to feel upper-class

51:55.640 --> 51:58.380
Okay. Yeah, no, at least it's not Kmart a

51:58.380 --> 52:04.860
Kmart is like, you heard that Martha Stewart was thinking about buying Kmart, and they

52:04.860 --> 52:11.860
were going to call it K-Martha, that's not a fucking joke, that's not a fucking joke!

52:11.860 --> 52:15.460
But they're having like this huge sale, and anyway, it's just ghetto, Kmart's ghetto,

52:15.460 --> 52:20.380
why would Martha Stewart want to buy Kmart? Kmart is ghetto, it is so ghetto, and ghetto

52:20.380 --> 52:23.980
people shop there too, and I'm not trying to say anything because ghetto people can

52:23.980 --> 52:28.940
be any color, any shape, any size. They are just some ghetto people that shop at Kmart,

52:28.940 --> 52:33.540
at least here. I don't know about your neck of the woods, but Kmart is ghetto. All right,

52:33.540 --> 52:40.100
anyway. I want to talk about Ultramix 3. Am I the only one in the room that's actually

52:40.100 --> 52:44.020
played Ultramix 3 today? No, Mel's played too? Okay, so I'm glad we can get a couple

52:44.020 --> 52:46.660
opinions here. Well, the rest of you guys have heard some of the songs. I know I played

52:46.660 --> 52:52.120
some of it for Loki there a little bit before the show. Let's start with the things I like

52:52.120 --> 52:56.880
about DDR UltraMix III.

52:56.880 --> 53:01.160
No, I'm kidding. There's actually a lot to like about UltraMix III. I like Xbox Live.

53:01.160 --> 53:05.160
Xbox Live is a lot cleaner. It's a lot better, I think. I like the fact that you

53:05.160 --> 53:07.360
can send messages to people within Xbox Live.

53:07.360 --> 53:11.280
I like how you don't have to quit out of the game and come back in to

53:11.280 --> 53:15.760
download new stuff that the new content stuff is integrated into the game.

53:15.760 --> 53:18.700
I think they did a very good job with that and sending the messages back to each

53:18.700 --> 53:19.040
other

53:19.040 --> 53:23.200
and seeing who all is online playing the game not necessarily in your room

53:23.200 --> 53:27.080
I think that's all great so the Xbox Live portion looks great love it

53:27.080 --> 53:30.600
song list is half and half for me

53:30.600 --> 53:33.760
there's some awesome stuff in the song list like just

53:33.760 --> 53:38.840
I love the spray song I love the real life song I love the gothian trancy

53:38.840 --> 53:39.920
stuff I always do though

53:39.920 --> 53:43.900
and then I love some of the stuff that they brought over from other

53:43.900 --> 53:47.080
bimani stuff is great like right on time from guitar for you says great himawari

53:47.080 --> 53:51.760
from Guitar Freaks as well. Parade of the Wooden Soldiers,

53:51.760 --> 53:56.920
WTF, but that's kinda neat. Akumajo Dracula Medley, of course, was an awesome pick.

53:56.920 --> 54:02.240
They picked some good stuff. But then the song list kinda goes weird for me because

54:02.240 --> 54:06.520
they tried with the song list in UltraMix 3 to be much more eclectic and that is

54:06.520 --> 54:06.960
very

54:06.960 --> 54:12.040
obvious. Like they have more rap type stuff with the alphabet aerobics and

54:12.040 --> 54:16.480
and Run DMC and they have some rock type stuff with Good Charlotte

54:16.480 --> 54:19.880
and The Clash and No FX

54:19.880 --> 54:23.320
and then they have some old stuff like they have

54:23.320 --> 54:27.960
Ray Charles with What You Say. Let me play a clip of some of these like songs

54:27.960 --> 54:32.360
these are songs that literally made me go WTF when I brought them up

54:32.360 --> 54:36.640
in UltraMix 3 and I actually I got a copy of some of this music so we can play it for you guys

54:36.640 --> 54:37.520
here on the show tonight

54:37.520 --> 54:40.620
I'm not gonna play the whole one but I want I wanna see if you guys have the

54:40.620 --> 54:41.200
same

54:41.200 --> 54:45.160
reaction I did to this okay imagine you're going through the song list and then

54:45.160 --> 54:45.840
suddenly

54:45.840 --> 54:50.160
you come across this, okay? Listen to a little clip of this song

54:50.160 --> 54:54.160
and imagine arrows coming up the screen and all that.

54:54.160 --> 55:01.480
She the girl with the record song, she can do the burnin' all night long, yeah.

55:01.480 --> 55:08.080
What I say, all right.

55:08.080 --> 55:15.280
Well, tell me what I say, tell me what I say, baby, tell me what I say.

55:15.280 --> 55:21.880
Okay. Here's my thing. Is that song a good song? Yes, it's an awesome song. It's a wonderful

55:21.880 --> 55:25.520
song. It's an incredible song. I love that song. It's great. Is it a good choice for

55:25.520 --> 55:30.480
DDR? Hell no it's not a good pick for DDR. Hell no. What?

55:30.480 --> 55:34.560
I'm like going, eh? I know. I know. That's what I want. And I tried

55:34.560 --> 55:38.120
playing it and the steps, you know, were okay considering, you know, the song, you know,

55:38.120 --> 55:42.240
they did the best they could with the song. But I like playing DDR because this is one

55:42.240 --> 55:47.480
big thing that draws me to DDR. It's like a big jukebox. It's like the jukebox of now.

55:47.480 --> 55:55.100
And having to play that song that sounds like it is a copy of a copy of a copy from 19 whatever,

55:55.100 --> 55:59.900
I don't know. I can't get into it. I can't get into that song. Okay? Here's another classic

55:59.900 --> 56:07.940
example of, and this is another, now this, I don't know. I don't know how to describe

56:07.940 --> 56:12.060
it. Here's another pick that was in the game and you tell me how I'm supposed to dance

56:12.060 --> 56:19.060
to this.

56:35.380 --> 56:39.320
I feel like I'm playing DDR at Chevy's all of a sudden. Is the background to that song

56:39.320 --> 56:46.320
a flea market? No. Stop it with a horribly... No, but they did use the little cactus guys

56:46.580 --> 56:53.580
from Tomlinson Couple and all that, whatever. Again, is that a bad song? No, it's not a

56:53.840 --> 56:58.120
bad song. I mean, I don't choose to listen to that kind of music usually, but I think,

56:58.120 --> 57:02.880
you know, if I'm in the mood, if I'm drinking some margaritas, you know, that's good music

57:02.880 --> 57:08.200
to be hearing. But is that stuff I want to play in DDR? No. Here's my problem with the

57:08.200 --> 57:15.520
the song list Konami. If it ain't broke, don't fucking fix it. And Ultramix 2 had the best

57:15.520 --> 57:20.060
song list. It was incredible. It was a great song list. All these unknowns coming from

57:20.060 --> 57:26.000
a different drum and great transplants and remixes like Jairus. Awesome. Why did they

57:26.000 --> 57:30.520
break the formula? Why did they go and try to change it? Why were they suddenly like,

57:30.520 --> 57:36.440
oh, let's be as eclectic as we possibly can be and let's throw in the clash for no real

57:36.440 --> 57:41.880
good reason other than we want to pay homage to The Clash. You know what? Let's put in

57:41.880 --> 57:47.780
Ray Charles for no good reason other than we want to pay homage to Ray Charles. I don't

57:47.780 --> 57:52.400
get it. Something doesn't add up for me there. Maybe I'm just a stuck up snobby asshole when

57:52.400 --> 57:57.960
it comes to my music, but I played those songs once and I will probably not play them again.

57:57.960 --> 58:02.520
Which is too bad because, you know, one thing, and going back into things I like about Ultra

58:02.520 --> 58:08.360
Mix 3. The steps are great, and the steps were great in UltraMix 2, and as I understand

58:08.360 --> 58:13.120
that they made changes with who's doing the steps at Konami, but with the other mixes

58:13.120 --> 58:18.680
on into UltraMix 2, and it was a change for the better, because they got, you know, folks

58:18.680 --> 58:22.680
that were, from what we understand and what we're hearing, folks that were in the know

58:22.680 --> 58:27.920
on their DDR making the steps. So, and they've kept that for UltraMix 3, so that's great

58:27.920 --> 58:31.000
too, because the steps are all really cool, and they do some new things with them too,

58:31.000 --> 58:35.700
which is kind of neat. I was almost surprised, though, that they didn't try to get steps

58:35.700 --> 58:40.000
running backward yet, because that's the only thing we haven't seen in DDR yet, and in that

58:40.000 --> 58:43.940
Hey Mama song, there's a part where it totally could have ran backwards. It's awesome. I

58:43.940 --> 58:45.620
don't know. Anyway, just a weird thought.

58:45.620 --> 58:50.180
Actually, the whole backwards thing was an idea we tried to pitch for UltraMix 2 with

58:50.180 --> 58:53.340
the Max 300 remix, where it kind of goes, rit, rit, rit, rit.

58:53.340 --> 58:54.340
Oh, yeah.

58:54.340 --> 58:58.460
Because it sounds like it's being played backwards. We were trying, like, hell to get the engineering

58:58.460 --> 59:02.940
to work, but it's Hawaii we expect. We'll get on that later.

59:02.940 --> 59:08.980
You know what, I noticed this attitude of WTF Hawaii, and I'm all about showing Hawaii

59:08.980 --> 59:13.780
a little love after Ultra Mix 2, and I said on this show, and I do not take it back, that

59:13.780 --> 59:18.660
if Konami puts out another arcade mix, Hawaii should be the one doing it. However, I would

59:18.660 --> 59:23.180
like to go back and amend my previous statement to say, whoever did Ultra Mix 2 should be

59:23.180 --> 59:26.900
doing it. Because Ultra Mix 3, whoever was calling the shots with the song list, I'm

59:26.900 --> 59:31.000
I'm sorry I'm not feeling the love here. I'm not feeling it. And there's other big, big

59:31.000 --> 59:36.260
problems with UltraMix 3. Now, I'm not saying UltraMix 3 is a bad game, because it's a great

59:36.260 --> 59:39.400
game. And if you own an Xbox, you should be fucking buying this game. You should. There's

59:39.400 --> 59:44.280
no question about it. But there are some problems that really make me go WTF. Here is another

59:44.280 --> 59:55.120
huge ass problem. The song packs from UltraMix 2 are horribly off sync. Don't believe me?

59:55.120 --> 01:00:02.120
this out. I have proof that the songs are off sync. Because there might be people out

01:00:02.640 --> 01:00:06.700
there that say, oh Rob, you're just playing on your TV. You just think they're off sync.

01:00:06.700 --> 01:00:09.120
It feels like you're off sync because you're not hitting the buttons at the right time.

01:00:09.120 --> 01:00:14.320
No, no, no. I have proof. What I did is I took the song into training mode and put it

01:00:14.320 --> 01:00:19.320
on with claps, so you can hear exactly where the arrows fall in the song. Listen to this.

01:00:19.320 --> 01:00:46.240
Wait, hold on, I want you to listen to that part carefully again, because those notes

01:00:46.240 --> 01:00:49.240
are supposed to go with that when it comes to that doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo

01:00:49.240 --> 01:00:52.520
listen that the claps start like almost a full

01:00:52.520 --> 01:00:55.520
second before it really happens listen again

01:01:01.720 --> 01:01:04.440
now listen to this next part coming up with the freezes

01:01:04.440 --> 01:01:07.440
all the notes are on the upbeats watch this

01:01:07.440 --> 01:01:18.480
Those steps are supposed to be on the sirens!

01:01:18.480 --> 01:01:19.480
You get my picture?

01:01:19.480 --> 01:01:25.080
Wow, I totally feel like I'm flashback to two years ago QA'ing UltraMix 1, where it

01:01:25.080 --> 01:01:26.280
was horribly off.

01:01:26.280 --> 01:01:31.280
Well apparently somebody forgot to QA the second song packs or something, I don't know.

01:01:31.280 --> 01:01:34.520
But now the community who paid five bucks for those songs hoping that they get to play

01:01:34.520 --> 01:01:36.680
them on UltraMix 3, they're pissed!

01:01:36.680 --> 01:01:39.640
they're pissed because they can't play those songs in Ultramix City, they're ruined!

01:01:39.640 --> 01:01:43.640
We were doing, we played, I was playing on live the other day with people, I don't know

01:01:43.640 --> 01:01:47.080
these people, they're just random people on live, I, I, we, that song came up, we did

01:01:47.080 --> 01:01:50.400
like a random pick, I don't know, and that song came up, and we played that on live,

01:01:50.400 --> 01:01:54.480
and everybody was like, what the fuck, this song is fucked, what happened to this?

01:01:54.480 --> 01:01:59.480
Hey, now you know why we have such a huge freaking timing window in, uh, Ultramix.

01:01:59.480 --> 01:02:06.240
That was disabled the flaw, by the way, from Song Pack 9, if you don't believe me.

01:02:06.240 --> 01:02:09.760
So there it is, audio proof that the damn thing is off sync.

01:02:09.760 --> 01:02:13.400
And they should put out a patch, now the community is saying, you gotta patch it, you gotta patch

01:02:13.400 --> 01:02:14.400
it, put out a patch.

01:02:14.400 --> 01:02:17.840
I'm wondering if they can put out a patch, the game's probably not built to take a patch,

01:02:17.840 --> 01:02:18.840
I don't know.

01:02:18.840 --> 01:02:20.400
Because like Halo's different.

01:02:20.400 --> 01:02:24.660
When you go to Halo, Halo connects to the internet right away and if it sees the patch

01:02:24.660 --> 01:02:25.660
it gets it.

01:02:25.660 --> 01:02:29.760
If DER was not set up to do that, you're not gonna be able to get a patch that easy.

01:02:29.760 --> 01:02:30.760
So I don't know.

01:02:30.760 --> 01:02:32.080
I don't know what they're gonna do.

01:02:32.080 --> 01:02:34.520
I doubt they're gonna do anything.

01:02:34.520 --> 01:02:40.520
You can patch a game like that, just like they patched WWE WrestleMania 21.

01:02:40.520 --> 01:02:42.520
They can do a patch on that.

01:02:42.520 --> 01:02:43.520
Alright.

01:02:43.520 --> 01:02:45.520
Here we go.

01:02:45.520 --> 01:02:46.520
I want to play this as well.

01:02:46.520 --> 01:02:50.320
This is the other thing that pisses me off, and once again I have audio proof that this

01:02:50.320 --> 01:02:53.860
pisses me off, and you cannot dispute this.

01:02:53.860 --> 01:02:56.320
You cannot.

01:02:56.320 --> 01:02:58.520
Here's my beef.

01:02:58.520 --> 01:03:02.480
Loading times in UltraMix series have been kind of iffy as it is, okay?

01:03:02.480 --> 01:03:04.820
Now I would like to show you what it's like to load the game.

01:03:04.820 --> 01:03:08.680
Now I'm not even counting in the beginning, the game loads up, da da da, you get to the

01:03:08.680 --> 01:03:10.080
title screen, okay?

01:03:10.080 --> 01:03:14.160
What happens is that then there's a moment where it goes, loading song packs, and you

01:03:14.160 --> 01:03:17.560
have to wait, and you see these little bubble animations on the screen while it's loading

01:03:17.560 --> 01:03:21.640
your song packs, which okay, makes sense, that's how, even though the song packs are

01:03:21.640 --> 01:03:25.600
off sync and not worth loading anyway, this is how it, you know, brings them into the

01:03:25.600 --> 01:03:26.600
game.

01:03:26.600 --> 01:03:29.280
However, I would like to play for you guys, this is a direct audio rip, I am not fudging

01:03:29.280 --> 01:03:33.040
anything here this is a direct audio rip from earlier today when I was booting up

01:03:33.040 --> 01:03:36.040
the game and playing. So you're gonna hear the title music for just a minute

01:03:36.040 --> 01:03:38.780
and then you're gonna hear bloop bloop that is the game starting to load after

01:03:38.780 --> 01:03:41.560
I hit the A button and I'm not going to shorten this or anything this is

01:03:41.560 --> 01:03:48.080
seriously how long the load time is. Okay so here's a little tile screen okay and

01:03:48.080 --> 01:04:02.000
And then here we go.

01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:03.000
God damn it, Rob.

01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:08.000
Stop farting in the bathtub.

01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:15.040
Spin it out.

01:04:15.040 --> 01:04:17.640
See?

01:04:17.640 --> 01:04:18.640
30 seconds.

01:04:23.640 --> 01:04:25.640
I think I'll go get up and make a sandwich.

01:04:25.640 --> 01:04:28.640
A little bit longer than William Hung's stardom.

01:04:40.640 --> 01:04:42.640
That is a tasty burger.

01:04:42.640 --> 01:04:47.640
Oh, I wonder if my game is going to load any day now.

01:04:47.640 --> 01:04:52.640
Wow, I really have to play some DDR today.

01:04:52.640 --> 01:04:57.640
Oh! There we go! Finally! The goddamn thing loaded! Finally!

01:04:57.640 --> 01:05:07.640
One minute, five seconds! One whole minute for the goddamn song packs to load and they don't even work!

01:05:07.640 --> 01:05:16.640
Needless to say, if that's going to be the case, importing the song packs probably should have been an option that you could choose to do before you go into the game.

01:05:16.640 --> 01:05:20.640
I don't know. Or maybe just optimize your thing a little better. I don't know.

01:05:20.640 --> 01:05:26.640
You know, they say that DDR is exercise. This exercise would be screaming at the freaking console for it to load faster.

01:05:26.640 --> 01:05:29.640
That is just crazy.

01:05:29.640 --> 01:05:31.640
She's exercising patience.

01:05:31.640 --> 01:05:39.640
Welcome to DDR! Now we're going to exercise your patience!

01:05:39.640 --> 01:05:41.640
Jesus.

01:05:45.640 --> 01:05:48.640
Anyway, I don't know what else to say about that. Come on!

01:05:48.640 --> 01:05:51.640
Alright, so I'm dogging on the game a little bit.

01:05:51.640 --> 01:05:57.640
All in all though, it's not bad. I just liked Ultra Mix 2 a little bit better.

01:05:57.640 --> 01:05:59.640
Mel, what are your thoughts?

01:05:59.640 --> 01:06:05.640
Well, I guess I liked it better because I was on Ultramix 2. Who knows? It's a curse, perhaps.

01:06:05.640 --> 01:06:19.640
No, but just from, I guess, talking to people who are on the project and such, I think either Hawaii or RMC, spending a little too much time on things that were not all that crucial.

01:06:19.640 --> 01:06:24.640
Like, I heard Quest Mode got way too much more attention than it really needed to be.

01:06:24.640 --> 01:06:28.640
Oh, god, I didn't even mention Quest Mode. I mean, Quest Mode is...

01:06:28.640 --> 01:06:32.640
I mean, I guess it's cute, but the thing...

01:06:32.640 --> 01:06:36.640
The setup in EX2 was way better. Whatever that thing was, I don't even remember.

01:06:36.640 --> 01:06:40.640
Mission Mode or whatever, it was way better. That's what I expected Quest Mode was going to be.

01:06:40.640 --> 01:06:44.640
I didn't realize Quest Mode was just, play a lot of DDR and get shit.

01:06:44.640 --> 01:06:46.640
That's basically what Quest Mode is.

01:06:46.640 --> 01:06:50.640
Yeah, and there's so many bugs you get to gain more points or money or whatever.

01:06:50.640 --> 01:07:03.640
You can actually load your own edits into it, and like, what they did was, they would do like all sixteenths in like a circle pattern, so you just sit there and you rub the controller, boom, you know, so you jack up the, you know, points hardcore.

01:07:03.640 --> 01:07:15.640
Um, other than that, I mean, like, Songlist, I think it's sort of like, it's kind of like the iPod shuffle theory, they think, wow, if we can get it as broad as possible, we're gonna look that much cooler, you know, but...

01:07:15.640 --> 01:07:19.640
At the risk of alienating your fanbase that supported you through Ultramix 2?

01:07:19.640 --> 01:07:27.640
Basically, I mean, you know, I know they want to be different, it's a good thing, you know, I mean UltraMix, you know, has its own identity for the most part, but...

01:07:27.640 --> 01:07:38.640
Let's face it, we had to forgive Hawaii an awful lot for UltraMix 1, and then, you know, for UltraMix 2 it was like, okay guys, okay, you proved yourselves with UltraMix 2, we're cool, we can be a happy family, just don't disappoint us again.

01:07:38.640 --> 01:07:41.640
And then, pfft, Songlist was woo!

01:07:41.640 --> 01:07:45.640
Is it gonna be like Madden, where every other year it's good, and every other year it sucks?

01:07:45.640 --> 01:07:48.640
It sucks. It's like the Star Treks. The even number ones are good.

01:07:48.640 --> 01:07:50.640
Exactly!

01:07:50.640 --> 01:07:52.640
We'll see.

01:07:52.640 --> 01:07:54.640
Con!

01:07:54.640 --> 01:07:56.640
Shut up, all of you.

01:07:57.640 --> 01:07:59.640
Stop ruining this station. Alright.

01:07:59.640 --> 01:08:01.640
Anything else, Mil?

01:08:01.640 --> 01:08:05.640
I think, you know, they just put a little too much into the game.

01:08:05.640 --> 01:08:08.640
You know, just like, there's that whole dance, you know, freestyle mode and all that.

01:08:08.640 --> 01:08:12.640
I think they could have done without, you know, most of it is like spend more time on

01:08:12.640 --> 01:08:17.600
You know the actual gameplay itself on the timing windows and all that I mean granted. It's not as big as like

01:08:18.120 --> 01:08:22.480
Alaska now you know now as big as, Nevada you know but um

01:08:23.320 --> 01:08:27.040
Well, I think maybe it's the kind of thing where they're like well. They're not gonna notice it

01:08:27.320 --> 01:08:31.920
Well, I think it looks you forgot how rabid these DDR freaks can be yes

01:08:31.920 --> 01:08:37.480
You're gonna notice engineers don't notice it. You know the QA people do you know I mean yeah

01:08:37.480 --> 01:08:39.480
They have on there. You know they know there's

01:08:39.480 --> 01:08:48.480
I have a feeling that they knew some of this stuff was going on, and I don't know, I don't know, I can't speculate too much.

01:08:48.480 --> 01:08:55.480
I don't know if it's just reticence or laziness or what, you know, I ain't gonna say one way or another because I haven't nearly been close to the situation.

01:08:55.480 --> 01:09:02.480
But, you know, overall, hey, you know, they figured DDR, it's Xbox, it has to sell, you know.

01:09:02.480 --> 01:09:14.480
I know. I just hope when they do Ultramix 4 or Xbox 360 DDR, whatever's next for them, assuming there's going to be another mix, which there has to be. I can't see DDR dying just because the song list pissed me off.

01:09:14.480 --> 01:09:23.480
I want there to be another mix. The mix, overall, isn't bad. It's not. It's a good game, again. I'm just saying that. These little things make me mad.

01:09:23.480 --> 01:09:29.960
but when they do the future mix I just you know I hope they I hope they stick

01:09:29.960 --> 01:09:34.640
with the things that worked for them in Ultramix 2 and yeah what else can I say

01:09:34.640 --> 01:09:37.520
I don't know I would like to see them shake up the interface a little more to

01:09:37.520 --> 01:09:41.680
Ultramix 3 felt like Ultramix 2 plus in a lot of ways because then they didn't

01:09:41.680 --> 01:09:44.640
really change the interface except the bubbles which and I'm okay with the

01:09:44.640 --> 01:09:47.760
bubbles thing but where the bubbles thing got god-awful was like the little

01:09:47.760 --> 01:09:54.400
reflections in the bubbles blocks the graphics. It's like, okay, somebody in the art department

01:09:54.400 --> 01:10:02.120
wasn't thinking that whole thing out or something. I don't know. So, whatever. Anyway, any other

01:10:02.120 --> 01:10:07.040
comments from anybody on Ultramix 3? You guys asleep over here? Mario Kart over here, Loki?

01:10:07.040 --> 01:10:14.680
Hey, I haven't played Ultramix 3, so I can't comment, other than that some of the music

01:10:14.680 --> 01:10:20.540
is really weird yeah I almost want it you know say oh what the hell you know

01:10:20.540 --> 01:10:24.640
go ahead and get it because I have one in two sitting at home also is the online

01:10:24.640 --> 01:10:28.880
mode any better than extreme twos online oh the online mode is incredible the

01:10:28.880 --> 01:10:32.520
online mode is great it's the best online does it still have tournament

01:10:32.520 --> 01:10:35.680
mode in there where you can run a tournament on it I think so but I'm

01:10:35.680 --> 01:10:42.920
gonna be honest I didn't really look okay all right we're gonna another

01:10:42.920 --> 01:10:46.120
break you guys when we come back from this break you guys will have a chance

01:10:46.120 --> 01:10:49.680
to give your thoughts on UltraMix3 and anything else is on your mind. I know we

01:10:49.680 --> 01:10:52.520
have some folks that want to talk about this MTV taping some of them went to on

01:10:52.520 --> 01:10:55.980
the east coast and want to call in talk about this, some other random stories you

01:10:55.980 --> 01:10:59.080
guys wanna talk about it's your show when we come back from this break and we open up the

01:10:59.080 --> 01:11:03.420
skype line. And Orange Lounge Goes to the Movies. Orange Lounge Goes to the Movies will

01:11:03.420 --> 01:11:06.320
definitely work in too probably just before Cajemash night. We're going to

01:11:06.320 --> 01:11:09.480
do the skype line when we come back from this break with more UltraMix3 music

01:11:09.480 --> 01:11:12.320
and I know you guys are sending me requests but we're not gonna be able to

01:11:12.320 --> 01:11:15.440
do request until kind of later. I do want to definitely get the Ultramix 3 music out

01:11:15.440 --> 01:11:19.380
there so you guys can hear it. That's kind of the number one priority right now. Alright,

01:11:19.380 --> 01:11:23.340
now first we're going to start off with what is probably my personal favorite song on Ultramix

01:11:23.340 --> 01:11:27.380
3, and again this was sticking to getting music from different drum and the indie record

01:11:27.380 --> 01:11:34.380
labels that worked. This is Conflict by the Azoic. Enjoy.

01:12:27.380 --> 01:12:30.380
You told me, told me, told me

01:12:30.380 --> 01:12:32.380
You told me, told me, told me

01:12:32.380 --> 01:12:34.380
Please don't play

01:12:34.380 --> 01:12:37.380
Show me fear, I know now

01:12:37.380 --> 01:12:39.380
But for some fear

01:12:39.380 --> 01:12:42.380
I saw one thing that I know

01:12:42.380 --> 01:12:45.380
I was too young to know

01:12:45.380 --> 01:12:49.380
And I never knew what to do

01:12:51.380 --> 01:12:53.380
It's a beauty

01:12:53.380 --> 01:12:55.380
Oh

01:13:53.380 --> 01:14:14.980
I want you, I want you, I want you, I want you

01:14:44.980 --> 01:15:08.380
We were at a party Everybody had matching towels

01:15:08.380 --> 01:15:10.860
Somebody waits under a rock

01:15:10.860 --> 01:15:12.920
And there they saw a rock

01:15:13.720 --> 01:15:15.220
It wasn't a rock

01:15:16.500 --> 01:15:18.980
But the rock, rock the rock

01:15:23.740 --> 01:15:25.340
Rock, rock, rock

01:15:29.100 --> 01:15:30.340
Rock, rock, rock

01:16:00.340 --> 01:16:02.340
Rock

01:16:02.340 --> 01:16:04.340
Action

01:16:04.340 --> 01:16:06.340
Rock

01:16:16.340 --> 01:16:18.340
Rock, rock

01:16:48.340 --> 01:16:53.340
When I'm goin' to court, a white suit When I'm gettin' divorced, a black suit

01:16:53.340 --> 01:16:57.340
At the funeral home and my birthday too When I'm home alone, talkin' on the phone

01:16:57.340 --> 01:17:00.340
Got an interview with the Rolling Stone, they're sayin'

01:17:00.340 --> 01:17:04.340
Now you're rich and now you're famous Fake-ass girls all know your name and

Look out, you better stay safe, You never know what odds are coming when we say

01:17:44.140 --> 01:17:48.040
Where you're coming from, we've already seen the words that this life can bring

01:17:48.040 --> 01:17:51.780
Now we've expected everywhere that we go

01:17:51.780 --> 01:17:55.640

Orange Lounge Radio

01:18:20.620 --> 01:18:21.320
breakers

01:18:21.460 --> 01:18:21.960
Bahmani Music

01:18:22.680 --> 01:18:23.340
And more

01:18:23.340 --> 01:18:26.780
Perfect!

01:18:26.780 --> 01:18:29.340
Hi kids, we're back here on Orange Lounge Radio

01:18:29.340 --> 01:18:33.820
and in that break you heard some more music from the DDR Ultramix 3 including

01:18:33.820 --> 01:18:36.060
Conflict by the Azoic,

01:18:36.060 --> 01:18:38.260
Why by Neveraka,

01:18:38.260 --> 01:18:43.080
Rock Lobster by the B-52s, and I Just Wanna Live by Good Charlotte's all in that

01:18:43.080 --> 01:18:43.940
mix, so

01:18:43.940 --> 01:18:48.500
you know I was a little iffy with Good Charlotte being in Ultramix but

01:18:48.500 --> 01:18:52.520
that sounds not so bad, it could have been a lot worse that's for sure, I don't know

01:18:52.520 --> 01:18:55.980
but I don't listen to pop radio either so

01:18:55.980 --> 01:19:00.160
we'll see. Anyway, God, I just clicked a little button on

01:19:00.160 --> 01:19:03.720
Skype that says we're taking calls now and that we just get hammered with people but

01:19:03.720 --> 01:19:06.160
let's go to the first call. Hi, you're on Orange Orange Radio.

01:19:06.160 --> 01:19:09.280
Hey, it's... Hey, it's who?

01:19:09.280 --> 01:19:13.360
Jazz. Hey, Jazz, how you doing? Uh, pretty good.

01:19:13.360 --> 01:19:16.440
Alright, what do you think about DDR UltraMix III?

01:19:16.440 --> 01:19:21.320
Oh, as you know, I've always been a huge supporter of

01:19:21.320 --> 01:19:24.960
the ultimate you get your volume just went down by half i don't know if you

01:19:24.960 --> 01:19:29.380
move michael there we go

01:19:29.380 --> 01:19:31.780
now we can't hear you at all

01:19:31.780 --> 01:19:32.820
i think

01:19:32.820 --> 01:19:36.060
i think that better area yes much better what that

01:19:36.060 --> 01:19:40.620
okay i've always been a huge order

01:19:40.620 --> 01:19:43.940
this makes kind of drop the bomb in a lot of areas

01:19:43.940 --> 01:19:48.060
come on and drop the bomb do you do you do you do you do you do you do you do

01:19:48.060 --> 01:19:53.060
Alright, I'm kidding. You know I couldn't resist. Why did it drop the bomb?

01:19:53.060 --> 01:19:58.060
Well, for one they added a bunch of rock songs that we didn't need to hear.

01:19:58.060 --> 01:20:09.060
I'll give you that. I understand no FX and The Clash wanting to pay homage to them, but I don't think they really worked for DDR. I didn't get that.

01:20:09.060 --> 01:20:16.060
Yeah, but mostly I think the song pack thing is completely unforgivable. I don't get that at all.

01:20:16.060 --> 01:20:18.600
Did you hear the little audio clip I played earlier?

01:20:18.600 --> 01:20:23.000
Yeah, and I've been playing, I've been trying to play the songs, and a lot of them are songs

01:20:23.000 --> 01:20:25.920
I've loved, like Diamond Jealousy and R5.

01:20:25.920 --> 01:20:27.960
And yeah, it's not just limited to like three songs.

01:20:27.960 --> 01:20:32.660
I know Rini compiled some stuff and put it on the DR Freak forum, and probably half the

01:20:32.660 --> 01:20:36.840
other forums out there on the internet, and it's got like Jack and Mark Get Busy, and

01:20:36.840 --> 01:20:37.840
all these other songs.

01:20:37.840 --> 01:20:41.040
I mean, it's like a list of like ten songs that are broken in the song packs.

01:20:41.040 --> 01:20:42.660
It's sucky.

01:20:42.660 --> 01:20:43.840
It's ridiculous.

01:20:43.840 --> 01:20:45.800
It's completely unprofessional, in my opinion.

01:20:45.800 --> 01:20:48.320
Yeah, it sucks. It sucks.

01:20:48.320 --> 01:20:51.480
I don't know how. How did they miss that? That's what I want to know. It's like somebody

01:20:51.480 --> 01:20:55.420
didn't even test to see if the song packs worked. I don't know. How do you miss that?

01:20:55.420 --> 01:20:56.720
I don't know.

01:20:56.720 --> 01:21:00.200
Or they knew about it and just didn't give a shit. I don't know.

01:21:00.200 --> 01:21:02.100
Yeah, something like that. Who knows.

01:21:02.100 --> 01:21:04.800
What else? Any other thoughts you have on Ultramix 3?

01:21:04.800 --> 01:21:07.260
Um, a lot of things I like

01:21:07.260 --> 01:21:12.260
is a bunch of songs like So Many Times, which I absolutely love.

01:21:12.260 --> 01:21:15.940
I think we have that queued for the next break, so we'll play that, definitely.

01:21:15.940 --> 01:21:19.380
Yeah, the steps are really good this time.

01:21:19.380 --> 01:21:23.420
The steps are all pretty good, especially when you consider that

01:21:23.420 --> 01:21:26.620
there are some songs where it's like, you know, this shouldn't even be in DDR.

01:21:26.620 --> 01:21:29.620
The steps, they do the best they can, you know what I mean?

01:21:29.620 --> 01:21:33.500
Yeah, like even the songs that aren't made for DDR, like

01:21:33.500 --> 01:21:36.620
Meowma and all that, they're just

01:21:36.620 --> 01:21:40.100
fun to play, so.

01:21:40.100 --> 01:21:44.620
I just, whereas the steps are good, I'm not going to knock the steps because they do the

01:21:44.620 --> 01:21:45.620
best they can.

01:21:45.620 --> 01:21:48.980
It's not fun to play because the song makes my ears want to, you know, scream out in pain.

01:21:48.980 --> 01:21:54.340
I can't play it, so.

01:21:54.340 --> 01:22:00.980
Besides that, I'm kind of iffy about the online because it's a lot better this time.

01:22:00.980 --> 01:22:06.160
I think the online is like the best part too, is like they really improved online support.

01:22:06.160 --> 01:22:12.320
But the scoring is still a little iffy, because if you get a full combo, you instantly win,

01:22:12.320 --> 01:22:19.000
which is really annoying. Because, you know, I've been through like multiple players already

01:22:19.000 --> 01:22:24.080
where they've gotten 50 greats and I've gotten 7, and I lose, and I'm like, what the fuck?

01:22:24.080 --> 01:22:28.120
Why, because you didn't get a full combo? Yeah, I got a miss because the controller

01:22:28.120 --> 01:22:34.800
for Xbox is completely CDR. Yeah, I don't know if it's keeping track of

01:22:34.800 --> 01:22:38.580
my win-loss record appropriately, but I do like the fact that it shows on the little

01:22:38.580 --> 01:22:43.740
preview like what your highest score is, because in my case I have a triple A, so my highest

01:22:43.740 --> 01:22:46.640
score is like a perfect score, and it shows like how many triple A's and how many double

01:22:46.640 --> 01:22:48.860
A's you have, which I think is kind of cool. That's kind of neat.

01:22:48.860 --> 01:22:51.620
I like that. That's funny. Besides that.

01:22:51.620 --> 01:22:57.140
Well, anything else you want to share about the mixed jazz before I get to another call?

01:22:57.140 --> 01:23:01.140
It's perfectly good to me, besides all the crap that's messed up.

01:23:01.140 --> 01:23:04.420
Yeah. Alright. On the scale of one to ten?

01:23:04.420 --> 01:23:07.980
Seven. Alright.

01:23:07.980 --> 01:23:12.300
Take care Jazz. Thanks for calling in. Have a good one, okay? Bye. Have a nice day.

01:23:12.300 --> 01:23:15.980
Later. Bye. Alright, let's go to another call.

01:23:15.980 --> 01:23:18.980
We are getting hammered tonight, boys and girls. We may not get to all the calls.

01:23:18.980 --> 01:23:22.980
I'm really sorry, but we're gonna try our best, okay? Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

01:23:22.980 --> 01:23:27.500
Hi, Sephiroth1215 here. Hi, Sephiroth1215. What's on your mind, buddy?

01:23:27.500 --> 01:23:30.780
Um, just two things. First of all,

01:23:30.780 --> 01:23:42.540
About UltraMix 3 really quickly, um, it's pretty good. I mean, first of all, I say I do like The Clash a lot, so I appreciate that song a lot more.

01:23:42.540 --> 01:23:45.940
But is it a good DDR song?

01:23:45.940 --> 01:23:48.740
Uh, it seems kinda fit. It's really catchy.

01:23:48.740 --> 01:23:52.740
I guess that's just where people have difference of opinion, but okay.

01:23:52.740 --> 01:23:56.740
Um, but otherwise, alright, they do have a lot of problems.

01:23:56.740 --> 01:24:01.540
But the whole loading time thing, it's the same thing in the other UltraMix games.

01:24:01.540 --> 01:24:03.240
It's just they don't have the loading screen.

01:24:03.240 --> 01:24:06.540
Maybe that's what it is, it doesn't feel like it's so long in the other games,

01:24:06.540 --> 01:24:10.240
or maybe it's because there's not as many song packs they're trying to import or something, I don't know.

01:24:10.240 --> 01:24:14.740
Like, I knew in UltraMix 2 it was kind of a little bit slow, but...

01:24:14.740 --> 01:24:18.740
I don't know, you just didn't feel it, it wasn't a minute long.

01:24:18.740 --> 01:24:23.560
is is it seems like it's really bad at this one i mean it's just me

01:24:23.560 --> 01:24:24.660
yeah and

01:24:24.660 --> 01:24:25.680
quote from

01:24:25.680 --> 01:24:30.180
open at twenty one is she left the bubbles

01:24:30.180 --> 01:24:31.620
the bubbles act

01:24:31.620 --> 01:24:33.780
i'm okay with the bubble theme but i just think

01:24:33.780 --> 01:24:36.660
it could have been better like you could have been executed better

01:24:36.660 --> 01:24:39.940
the bubbles but anyway this is about me this is about your thoughts all all

01:24:39.940 --> 01:24:41.800
shut up

01:24:41.800 --> 01:24:43.640
uh...

01:24:43.640 --> 01:24:47.600
but otherwise uh... i went to the m t b taping on

01:24:47.600 --> 01:24:49.040
tuesday

01:24:49.040 --> 01:24:52.080
what it now what was this for the empty taping for white games or so whatever

01:24:52.080 --> 01:24:53.520
it is they're doing

01:24:53.520 --> 01:24:59.120
at the game or as we could get which is really lame game orders

01:24:59.120 --> 01:25:01.100
god bless m t v

01:25:01.100 --> 01:25:03.060
god bless them

01:25:03.060 --> 01:25:06.160
i how was it what they do what's what what can you expect on

01:25:06.160 --> 01:25:10.260
on that game game orders up

01:25:10.260 --> 01:25:13.720
honestly really not much

01:25:13.720 --> 01:25:17.560
I was kind of psyched up at first. I was waiting on line to get in.

01:25:17.560 --> 01:25:23.520
And I was in front of the line, so she's like, oh, you know, you first six or seven people,

01:25:23.520 --> 01:25:26.760
you come into the gaming room. So I'm like, all right, the gaming room's

01:25:26.760 --> 01:25:30.360
going to be awesome. But then we get there.

01:25:30.360 --> 01:25:32.440
It looks cool. They have nice TVs and everything.

01:25:32.440 --> 01:25:36.840
They have a 360 set up. Like one 360?

01:25:36.840 --> 01:25:41.480
Yeah. Because that's all MTV got allocated in the

01:25:41.480 --> 01:25:48.480
Yeah, shortage. Hey, Paris got her 360. I bet she doesn't even know what a 360 is.

01:25:48.480 --> 01:25:53.480
It just matches her purse, that cunt. Anyway. Anyway, sorry.

01:25:53.480 --> 01:25:57.480
It was a 360 with only one controller.

01:25:57.480 --> 01:26:01.480
Well, again, didn't you hear about the shortage problems?

01:26:01.480 --> 01:26:05.480
Now we're going to play a 32-player deathmatch. Go.

01:26:05.480 --> 01:26:08.680
It's like Mario Party 7 where it splits up the controller.

01:26:08.680 --> 01:26:13.160
Okay, okay now Sephiroth1215, you get a button, and this guy over here, you get a button,

01:26:13.160 --> 01:26:16.360
and you get a button, and suddenly it's like The Oprah Show,

01:26:16.360 --> 01:26:20.480
and you get a button, and you get a button, and you get a button!

01:26:20.480 --> 01:26:23.680
Sorry, that was really random, I'm sorry, go ahead.

01:26:23.680 --> 01:26:27.280
It doesn't even matter because the batteries die in the controller anyway.

01:26:27.280 --> 01:26:33.480
Good game, GG MTV, GG.

01:26:33.480 --> 01:26:35.080
gg

01:26:35.080 --> 01:26:36.100
and

01:26:36.100 --> 01:26:37.520
they didn't

01:26:37.520 --> 01:26:41.720
do much so they just gave like a fake controller and just said

01:26:41.720 --> 01:26:43.080
pretend to play

01:26:43.080 --> 01:26:45.880
to the person who was there

01:26:45.880 --> 01:26:47.720
but wow

01:26:47.720 --> 01:26:50.960
i was the one sitting there playing a stupid Frogger game

01:26:50.960 --> 01:26:53.320
you have to play the new Frogger game?

01:26:53.320 --> 01:26:56.680
there's a Frogger game, is this on 360?

01:26:56.680 --> 01:26:59.880
uh... no, the original xbox

01:26:59.880 --> 01:27:00.880
Wait, what the what?

01:27:00.880 --> 01:27:01.880
Frog or Ancient Shadows.

01:27:01.880 --> 01:27:03.160
Then what the hell is this thing all about?

01:27:03.160 --> 01:27:04.160
It's not about the 360.

01:27:04.160 --> 01:27:06.500
What is this show all about?

01:27:06.500 --> 01:27:09.960
It's just trying to do something for gamers.

01:27:09.960 --> 01:27:10.960
I don't know.

01:27:10.960 --> 01:27:11.960
The question everyone...

01:27:11.960 --> 01:27:12.960
Do what?

01:27:12.960 --> 01:27:13.960
Set us back five years?

01:27:13.960 --> 01:27:17.820
The question everyone wants to know is why is anyone playing Frog or Ancient Shadows?

01:27:17.820 --> 01:27:18.820
That's what I want to know.

01:27:18.820 --> 01:27:22.220
Yet another reason to hate Konami of Hawaii.

01:27:22.220 --> 01:27:23.220
Did they do that game too?

01:27:23.220 --> 01:27:25.580
Man, Hawaii lives off Frogger, dude.

01:27:25.580 --> 01:27:26.580
Like nobody's business.

01:27:26.580 --> 01:27:27.940
Do people buy it?

01:27:27.940 --> 01:27:28.940
You know why?

01:27:28.940 --> 01:27:32.700
the ten dollar ban at Walmart and people go, oh I'm gonna get Frogger for my grandson.

01:27:32.700 --> 01:27:39.700
I remember Frogger. I remember Frogger. That's a hip gay, that's a bee's knees that game.

01:27:39.940 --> 01:27:46.940
Anyway sorry, was Frogger the bee's knees? It was a pretty bad game but whatever I was

01:27:46.940 --> 01:27:53.820
stuck playing it. But the other games were like I think Pac-Man World 3 and then Ultimate

01:27:53.820 --> 01:27:58.500
Spider-Man. Oh I'm glad they threw the Ultimate Spider-Man in there, I was like did they get

01:27:58.500 --> 01:28:03.500
Are they confused? Did they go off a list of what's hot, 1980 or something?

01:28:03.500 --> 01:28:08.500
Somebody tell MTV that they got Pac-Man Fever.

01:28:08.500 --> 01:28:10.500
Um, forget it.

01:28:10.500 --> 01:28:17.500
You know Rob, I actually, um, crap, I forgot to bring you a copy of Pac-World 3.

01:28:17.500 --> 01:28:19.500
It's okay, it can wait.

01:28:19.500 --> 01:28:22.500
I had four of them, two of them have been returned already.

01:28:22.500 --> 01:28:25.500
You know I actually was at Applebee's the other day and heard Pac-Man Fever on the radio

01:28:25.500 --> 01:28:27.500
radio and I was like, I thought that song died with it.

01:28:27.500 --> 01:28:29.500
Anyway, I'm sorry, we have a caller online.

01:28:29.500 --> 01:28:32.500
So, are we going to see you on TV?

01:28:32.500 --> 01:28:33.500
Uh, yeah.

01:28:33.500 --> 01:28:37.500
Did you flash the OLR gang sign?

01:28:37.500 --> 01:28:42.500
No, unfortunately, you know, we couldn't really do much, first of all.

01:28:42.500 --> 01:28:46.500
But if you had an OLR shirt, I would definitely wear it.

01:28:46.500 --> 01:28:48.500
I know, I keep hearing that.

01:28:48.500 --> 01:28:51.500
If you only had the OLR shirt, we're working on it.

01:28:51.500 --> 01:28:54.340
We just, we need, we need what's called, um, what do you call it?

01:28:54.340 --> 01:28:55.460
Like a seed money.

01:28:55.660 --> 01:28:58.620
We need money to buy the shirts and then we can sell them.

01:28:58.660 --> 01:29:00.860
So that's what we do.

01:29:00.860 --> 01:29:01.940
We do have $25.

01:29:01.940 --> 01:29:02.260
That's true.

01:29:02.260 --> 01:29:03.060
We want $25.

01:29:03.700 --> 01:29:05.940
Anyway, anything else you want to say about the MTV taping?

01:29:06.740 --> 01:29:11.980
Uh, yeah, there, there was a brief second half where it was like the actual filming

01:29:11.980 --> 01:29:20.180
for the countdown they had, and we got free sports games, which in turn, I bet

01:29:20.180 --> 01:29:21.300
you won't turn around and sold.

01:29:21.300 --> 01:29:23.580
did they give you a key plan like

01:29:23.580 --> 01:29:28.920
topspin a virtual as they have been all those games are huge in the u s

01:29:28.920 --> 01:29:30.480
i'm actually the

01:29:30.480 --> 01:29:35.480
dot india six and then i know that i mean oh five

01:29:35.480 --> 01:29:39.420
you know i didn't know if i don't fight the i feel it now last year leading the

01:29:39.420 --> 01:29:43.140
surplus on you guys before they bury them in new mexico

01:29:43.140 --> 01:29:44.100
uh... wait

01:29:44.100 --> 01:29:47.640
but it's all right is a family that's all right behind i don't know i have

01:29:47.640 --> 01:29:53.640
It still sucks! Madden's done! I mean, give me Genesis Madden!

01:29:53.640 --> 01:29:56.640
I'd have rather had Madden 05-06.

01:29:56.640 --> 01:30:01.640
It's alright though, because I took them, I went down to Walmart and got full credit for it.

01:30:01.640 --> 01:30:04.640
There you go! There you go, good man, good man.

01:30:04.640 --> 01:30:08.640
Alright, we gotta let you go because we gotta get to other calls, but thank you for telling us what's going on.

01:30:08.640 --> 01:30:11.640
Now, what are you wearing on the show so we can spot you?

01:30:11.640 --> 01:30:13.640
I'm wearing a DDR Freak shirt.

01:30:13.640 --> 01:30:18.640
Even though you're promoting the competition. No, I'm kidding. We love TDR Freak. That's great.

01:30:18.640 --> 01:30:23.640
By the way, the show is Direct Effect.

01:30:23.640 --> 01:30:25.640
Tomorrow and Tuesday.

01:30:25.640 --> 01:30:27.640
Tomorrow and Tuesday. What time?

01:30:27.640 --> 01:30:31.640
Over here. You know what's on a thing at seven maybe?

01:30:31.640 --> 01:30:33.640
Either way, just look for Direct Effect.

01:30:33.640 --> 01:30:35.640
I'll be sure to set my TiVo.

01:30:35.640 --> 01:30:36.640
Alright.

01:30:36.640 --> 01:30:37.640
Okay.

01:30:37.640 --> 01:30:40.640
Take care, buddy. Have a good one. Thanks for calling.

01:30:40.640 --> 01:30:41.640
You too. Bye.

01:30:41.640 --> 01:30:42.640
Later.

01:31:12.640 --> 01:31:13.660
from florida

01:31:13.660 --> 01:31:15.580
uh... what's on your mind

01:31:15.580 --> 01:31:17.660
uh...

01:31:17.660 --> 01:31:19.860
dang this is driving me crazy

01:31:19.860 --> 01:31:21.440
actually i wanted to bring up uh...

01:31:21.440 --> 01:31:23.740
the guitar freaks

01:31:23.740 --> 01:31:26.160
now are we talking guitar freaks or guitar hero

01:31:26.160 --> 01:31:29.000
oh guitar hero sorry, what's up with guitar hero

01:31:29.000 --> 01:31:32.180
well actually i was trying to figure out if i should

01:31:32.180 --> 01:31:35.580
save my money and go for beatmania

01:31:35.580 --> 01:31:39.060
when it comes out or

01:31:39.060 --> 01:31:45.000
Well, here's the way we see it, is that Guitar Hero is out now and costs, what, 70 bucks,

01:31:45.000 --> 01:31:46.680
I think is how much Guitar Hero costs?

01:31:46.680 --> 01:31:51.360
BeatMania is out, what, the last date we heard is February 8th, I think is what we heard

01:31:51.360 --> 01:31:52.360
for BeatMania?

01:31:52.360 --> 01:31:53.360
February 10th.

01:31:53.360 --> 01:31:56.320
February 10th or February 8th, sometime in early February is when that's coming out.

01:31:56.320 --> 01:31:59.720
We don't know how much it's going to cost for sure, but let's say it's about the same,

01:31:59.720 --> 01:32:00.720
$70.

01:32:00.720 --> 01:32:01.720
That would seem pretty reasonable, okay?

01:32:01.720 --> 01:32:02.720
Right.

01:32:02.720 --> 01:32:06.320
So, the thing is, can you save $70 between now and February?

01:32:06.320 --> 01:32:07.320
Probably.

01:32:07.320 --> 01:32:12.620
Probably. Well then buy them both! But the thing is they keep hearing such great things about

01:32:12.620 --> 01:32:16.320
Guitar Hero, I don't wanna, you know, not get it.

01:32:16.320 --> 01:32:19.620
Guitar Hero is a great game, honestly. If you like

01:32:19.620 --> 01:32:23.640
the guitar games at all, like, I'm gonna be honest, it's better than Guitar Freaks and the

01:32:23.640 --> 01:32:25.020
reason why is because

01:32:25.020 --> 01:32:29.860
it feels more like you're playing an actual guitar as opposed to holding

01:32:29.860 --> 01:32:31.420
something that looks like a guitar

01:32:31.420 --> 01:32:35.820
and pushing these buttons. Really, the five button thing really adds a lot to it

01:32:35.820 --> 01:32:36.940
and what they do

01:32:36.940 --> 01:32:40.320
is they do this thing with the fret buttons where you can actually push the

01:32:40.320 --> 01:32:41.280
fret buttons and

01:32:41.280 --> 01:32:44.740
it's hard for me to explain, but you can push the buttons in order

01:32:44.740 --> 01:32:49.120
and get the different sounds, which you couldn't do on Guitar Freaks. You had to

01:32:49.120 --> 01:32:52.040
be holding the exact right button combinations if the damn thing didn't work.

01:32:52.040 --> 01:32:56.340
And, you know, they did an awesome job in the art direction department. Let's

01:32:56.340 --> 01:32:57.960
face it, Guitar Freaks was cool

01:32:57.960 --> 01:33:01.700
for about the first 75 mixes, but now that they're on, you know, whatever they're on

01:33:01.700 --> 01:33:01.960
like

01:33:01.960 --> 01:33:05.480
Guitar Freaks super duper second mix, whatever they're on,

01:33:05.480 --> 01:33:10.360
V2. I don't even...V2, thank you. Okay, whatever the hell they're on. It's the same damn game.

01:33:10.360 --> 01:33:14.360
Nothing has been changed, and it's the same damn interface. Even though they went up to

01:33:14.360 --> 01:33:20.000
PlayStation 2, it's the same thing, except the videos are now full motion videos. Whoopie

01:33:20.000 --> 01:33:24.100
doo! I don't watch the videos when I play the game, okay? That's why I think Guitar

01:33:24.100 --> 01:33:28.860
Hero got it a little bit better. And plus, here's the other big thing though. If you

01:33:28.860 --> 01:33:35.320
like songs, if you like the J-Pop, Happy, Go Lucky, Ya Ya Ya songs, then Guitar Freaks

01:33:35.320 --> 01:33:40.820
is going to be the better game because Guitar Hero is filled with good old fashioned American

01:33:40.820 --> 01:33:46.060
butt rock is what's in Guitar Hero. And so if you like the butt rock, you're going to

01:33:46.060 --> 01:33:49.380
like this game. When I say butt rock, I mean like, you know, Pantera.

01:33:49.380 --> 01:33:53.520
If I don't like that kind of rock, then look. Then you're not going to like Guitar Hero.

01:33:53.520 --> 01:33:54.960
You're not going to like the song list. Okay.

01:33:54.960 --> 01:33:58.400
So maybe that answers your question right there. There are a couple... I'm not a huge

01:33:58.400 --> 01:34:02.640
fan of butt rock, but there are kind of a cool few songs here and there like I Like

01:34:02.640 --> 01:34:07.520
rock and roll, Ziggy Stardust, you know, those songs are cool. And then I think it was really

01:34:07.520 --> 01:34:12.240
neat that they put a bunch of unknown bands as the 17, I think it's what, 17 unlocked

01:34:12.240 --> 01:34:17.040
songs? That's kind of neat. But, yeah, Freezepop, awesome. But, you know, let's face it, the

01:34:17.040 --> 01:34:23.280
majority of the song list is good old-fashioned hardcore butt rock. So, I don't know, if that's

01:34:23.280 --> 01:34:25.240
not- Right, but it's just people saying wonderful

01:34:25.240 --> 01:34:28.560
things about the song list, and I'm like, well, you know, what if I don't like that

01:34:28.560 --> 01:34:30.880
style of music? Then you're not going to like Guitar Hero.

01:34:30.880 --> 01:34:33.200
And it's pretty easy to find the song list.

01:34:33.200 --> 01:34:36.000
If you go to GuitarHeroGame.com, that's the website.

01:34:36.000 --> 01:34:39.400
They got a song list right on the website, so it's not hard to find it.

01:34:39.400 --> 01:34:43.400
But if you are into the Japanese, like, if you like trance and stuff, BeatMania, hell,

01:34:43.400 --> 01:34:46.640
BeatMania is, I don't, we don't know what songs for sure are going to be BeatMania.

01:34:46.640 --> 01:34:50.400
I mean, we know a few here and there, but rest assured, if it's like any of the other

01:34:50.400 --> 01:34:55.780
past what, 1,500 mixes they've had in Japan, you're going to have your happy trance and

01:34:55.780 --> 01:35:00.120
some J-pop, and if that's the kind of music you're into, BeatMania is where it's at.

01:35:00.120 --> 01:35:01.120
Okay.

01:35:01.120 --> 01:35:02.120
All right.

01:35:02.120 --> 01:35:03.120
Have fun.

01:35:03.120 --> 01:35:04.120
Yeah.

01:35:04.120 --> 01:35:05.120
You too.

01:35:05.120 --> 01:35:08.120
Keep supporting them music games because starving programmers need your money.

01:35:08.120 --> 01:35:09.120
Okay?

01:35:09.120 --> 01:35:10.120
Yeah.

01:35:10.120 --> 01:35:11.120
Rockstar's getting it.

01:35:11.120 --> 01:35:12.120
All right.

01:35:12.120 --> 01:35:13.120
Well, wait.

01:35:13.120 --> 01:35:14.120
No, no, no, no.

01:35:14.120 --> 01:35:15.120
Oh, wait.

01:35:15.120 --> 01:35:16.120
Rockstar?

01:35:16.120 --> 01:35:17.120
Oh, for In the Groove?

01:35:17.120 --> 01:35:18.120
Yeah.

01:35:18.120 --> 01:35:19.120
Oh, that's a whole other thing, man.

01:35:19.120 --> 01:35:20.120
That's a whole other topic.

01:35:20.120 --> 01:35:21.120
I know.

01:35:21.120 --> 01:35:22.120
I brought it up like a month ago.

01:35:22.120 --> 01:35:23.120
I know.

01:35:23.120 --> 01:35:24.120
You think I remember each of these shows, please.

01:35:24.120 --> 01:35:25.120
With all the drugs I do.

01:35:25.120 --> 01:35:26.120
Come on.

01:35:26.120 --> 01:35:27.120
Just kidding.

01:35:27.120 --> 01:35:28.120
Just kidding, kids.

01:35:28.120 --> 01:35:29.120
Don't do drugs.

01:35:29.120 --> 01:35:31.120
Okay. Alright, have a good one.

01:35:31.120 --> 01:35:33.120
You too. Later!

01:35:33.120 --> 01:35:35.120
Rockstar sucks. No, I'm kidding.

01:35:35.120 --> 01:35:37.120
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

01:35:37.120 --> 01:35:39.120
I just had to drop that. No, I'm kidding, I'm kidding.

01:35:39.120 --> 01:35:41.120
I just wanted to make somebody angry.

01:35:41.120 --> 01:35:43.120
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

01:35:43.120 --> 01:35:47.120
You know, in the groove is okay.

01:35:47.120 --> 01:35:50.120
I'd like to mention I said nothing.

01:35:50.120 --> 01:35:52.120
You are a good boy. You are a very good boy, Loki.

01:35:52.120 --> 01:35:53.120
No, no, no.

01:35:53.120 --> 01:35:56.120
Keep playing Mario Kart. It's keeping you quiet over there.

01:35:56.120 --> 01:36:01.120
I've got almost all the races beat in 150cc.

01:36:01.120 --> 01:36:08.120
Actually, I have to say I'm strangely looking forward to In The Group 2 on a home console.

01:36:08.120 --> 01:36:14.120
I think if they fix a lot of things, I don't know. It might be neat. We'll see.

01:36:14.120 --> 01:36:16.120
It'd be neat when they get sued.

01:36:16.120 --> 01:36:21.120
Oh, stop it. Let's go to another call. Let's go to this one.

01:36:21.120 --> 01:36:23.120
Hi, you're on Orange Long Radio.

01:36:23.120 --> 01:36:27.720
Hey Sky speaker here. Hello. Oh, it's our resident 2dx whore. How are you doing?

01:36:28.240 --> 01:36:31.900
Don't you mean 2dx bastard? Oh, that's right. You're a 2dx bastard. Not a whore. I'm sorry

01:36:33.000 --> 01:36:38.500
Whores imply you're getting paid. Um, which you're not you're actually spending a lot of money that makes you

01:36:38.500 --> 01:36:42.580
I don't know what that makes you but what's on your mind? Well as of last Tuesday

01:36:42.580 --> 01:36:46.040
I finally got my copy of beat me 2dx tent style. Whoo

01:36:47.400 --> 01:36:48.760
How is it?

01:36:48.760 --> 01:36:57.760
It's really great. As a matter of fact, I would like to give my input on those 7TS exclusives.

01:36:57.760 --> 01:36:59.760
Go for it.

01:36:59.760 --> 01:37:05.760
First up is Taito no Suika by Burma Inazawa featuring Shimotsuki Haruka.

01:37:05.760 --> 01:37:14.760
On a scale of level 1 to level 12, which to level 12 is the most difficult, I would give it a level 10.

01:37:14.760 --> 01:37:18.680
okay I'm next up is a you know jellyhead

01:37:18.680 --> 01:37:21.600
a jelly kiss a mediate smack mix I'm

01:37:21.600 --> 01:37:25.280
I'm on seven key it stays as it is as level seven

01:37:25.280 --> 01:37:28.560
on the another I would give it a a level 10

01:37:28.560 --> 01:37:32.420
pretty hard I'm pretty hard what do you want to think about to clear it

01:37:32.420 --> 01:37:34.640
I have to ask you what do you think about that anyway because you're you're

01:37:34.640 --> 01:37:37.400
pretty loyal to all the Japanese mixes that come out what do you think about

01:37:37.400 --> 01:37:38.240
that US

01:37:38.240 --> 01:37:41.520
get like a US on crossing over in Japan what do you think about that

01:37:41.520 --> 01:37:43.520
I was quite surprised, actually.

01:37:43.520 --> 01:37:48.520
Yeah, I was surprised, too, but we actually have an interview with Minniehead in this week's podcast.

01:37:48.520 --> 01:37:51.520
It's pretty interesting because I kind of asked him right about this, too.

01:37:51.520 --> 01:37:54.520
So, you'll have to tune in to hear what he has to say, so it's kind of neat.

01:37:54.520 --> 01:37:55.520
Anyway, go ahead.

01:37:55.520 --> 01:37:58.520
Let's see, Hype the Core.

01:37:58.520 --> 01:38:03.520
I would, you know, on seven key, I would give it a level nine.

01:38:03.520 --> 01:38:06.520
On the another, it should be a level twelve.

01:38:06.520 --> 01:38:08.520
It's really the hardest one.

01:38:08.520 --> 01:38:09.520
Wow.

01:38:09.520 --> 01:38:22.520
Xian, yeah, I did a Tatsujin video on that. You know, what's really weird is it doesn't really look like a level 8. I should really give it a level 7.

01:38:22.520 --> 01:38:23.520
Really?

01:38:23.520 --> 01:38:24.520
Yeah.

01:38:24.520 --> 01:38:28.520
I like hearing that though because that means it'll be a hard song I can beat.

01:38:28.520 --> 01:38:33.520
And on the another, I give it a level 8 as it is.

01:38:33.520 --> 01:38:34.520
Okay.

01:38:34.520 --> 01:38:40.520
Um, let's see, what else? Uh, Satellite 020712 from Coded Arms.

01:38:40.520 --> 01:38:47.520
Um, it's level 8, it stays as it is on 7 key. On the another, I give it a level 11.

01:38:47.520 --> 01:38:48.520
That's awesome.

01:38:48.520 --> 01:38:50.520
Yeah, you didn't know they had Coded Arms in there?

01:38:50.520 --> 01:38:51.520
No, I didn't.

01:38:51.520 --> 01:38:52.520
No, you had to turn on the mic.

01:38:52.520 --> 01:38:53.520
I turned off the mic.

01:38:53.520 --> 01:38:59.520
I didn't realize they had that. No, what they needed was um, I wanna say it was Radar Rider, something like that, or um...

01:38:59.520 --> 01:39:02.520
Yeah, they're crossing over from their other franchises.

01:39:02.520 --> 01:39:03.520
Good stuff.

01:39:03.520 --> 01:39:09.760
Humble Roses music in Ultra Mix 3. That's good. Interesting. Anyway, go ahead.

01:39:09.760 --> 01:39:17.200
Let me check my 10th style here and give my personal opinion on the 76 exclusives. How

01:39:17.200 --> 01:39:19.520
many CS exclusives have I already mentioned so far?

01:39:19.520 --> 01:39:23.520
8, 10, or like 4 or 5.

01:39:23.520 --> 01:39:26.520
I don't know. Suica and Satalago20712.

01:39:26.520 --> 01:39:28.520
I think you're missing Strong Woman and...

01:39:28.520 --> 01:39:42.520
Oh yeah. On the another, I give it a level 8 because of the chords. Even though it's 95 bpm, which is really, really slow, I had a rough time.

01:39:42.520 --> 01:39:44.520
Sounds a little bit like War Game.

01:39:44.520 --> 01:39:45.520
Yeah.

01:39:45.520 --> 01:39:46.520
A little bit. Okay.

01:39:46.520 --> 01:39:56.520
A little bit. And I think the last one, hmm. What was it again? Oh, Acid Vision. Here we go. Oh, very, very good song.

01:39:56.520 --> 01:40:02.520
Level 8 stays as it is on 7 key and on the another, I give it a level 10.

01:40:02.520 --> 01:40:05.520
All right. What are your thoughts about 10 style overall?

01:40:05.520 --> 01:40:16.520
Oh, it's really, really good. They just put in a judge mode in which you can see how many perfect grades and grades that you have.

01:40:16.520 --> 01:40:25.520
What else? They have the end of the DG point. And yeah, Sakurina, one more lovely ownage.

01:40:25.520 --> 01:40:30.620
All right. Any other words for our listeners before we let you go? We've got to get to

01:40:30.620 --> 01:40:31.620
another call.

01:40:31.620 --> 01:40:36.720
Well, I just want to say, ah, go get 10 style.

01:40:36.720 --> 01:40:41.880
All right. I actually plan on getting it as soon as I get a new controller, which will

01:40:41.880 --> 01:40:46.320
be very soon, because I've heard the rumors that Konami is putting out a new one for the

01:40:46.320 --> 01:40:50.200
U.S., as I'm sure we all have, but we'll see. And if it's true, I'm definitely getting one.

01:40:50.200 --> 01:40:51.200
So we'll see.

01:40:51.200 --> 01:41:00.200
Go watch my Tatsujin videos, Desolation & Other, Don't Forget & Other, and the Exe & Seventy that I did.

01:41:00.200 --> 01:41:01.200
Put a link in the chatroom.

01:41:01.200 --> 01:41:08.200
I'll post it online, the site that has the Tatsujin videos that I have.

01:41:08.200 --> 01:41:10.200
Absolutely, put a link in our chatroom.

01:41:10.200 --> 01:41:13.200
Alright, take care buddy.

01:41:13.200 --> 01:41:14.200
Alright, later.

01:41:14.200 --> 01:41:15.200
Later.

01:41:15.200 --> 01:41:16.760
One more call, you guys.

01:41:16.760 --> 01:41:18.320
And we're getting hammered tonight.

01:41:18.320 --> 01:41:20.240
So if we don't get to your call, I'm really sorry.

01:41:20.240 --> 01:41:21.800
We're almost out of time.

01:41:21.800 --> 01:41:24.800
We'll try to get more calls in a little later during the show.

01:41:24.800 --> 01:41:26.400
However, we're going to do one more.

01:41:26.400 --> 01:41:30.280
Hello, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

01:41:30.280 --> 01:41:30.960
Hi.

01:41:30.960 --> 01:41:31.440
Hi.

01:41:31.440 --> 01:41:33.080
Who's this?

01:41:33.080 --> 01:41:33.880
This is Roz.

01:41:33.880 --> 01:41:34.640
Hi, Roz.

01:41:34.640 --> 01:41:35.320
How are you?

01:41:40.320 --> 01:41:42.640
That sounds a little iffy to me.

01:41:42.640 --> 01:41:45.640
Yeah, I had an interesting weekend.

01:41:45.640 --> 01:41:48.640
Okay, do tell. What happened on your interesting weekend?

01:41:48.640 --> 01:41:55.640
Okay, well, my dad has been in Mexico all week, and he just got back on Friday night.

01:41:55.640 --> 01:41:56.640
Okay.

01:41:56.640 --> 01:42:03.640
And, as some of you may know, I was in a school play on Friday and Saturday evening.

01:42:03.640 --> 01:42:05.640
Okay.

01:42:05.640 --> 01:42:12.640
Well, he gets back Friday night after the play. Missed the first night. That's alright. I figure you could be the next night.

01:42:15.640 --> 01:42:24.640
Saturday morning, I wake up. I apparently had some kind of horrible allergic reaction to the makeup that they used on my face.

01:42:24.640 --> 01:42:26.640
Oh, no!

01:42:26.640 --> 01:42:32.640
So, I looked and felt sunburnt the whole day, and still do.

01:42:32.640 --> 01:42:36.920
And that wasn't something that they found out before the play went, like you guys didn't

01:42:36.920 --> 01:42:39.800
do like a full-on dress rehearsal or anything or?

01:42:39.800 --> 01:42:40.800
No.

01:42:40.800 --> 01:42:41.800
No.

01:42:41.800 --> 01:42:42.800
Definitely.

01:42:42.800 --> 01:42:45.240
We didn't do a dress rehearsal.

01:42:45.240 --> 01:42:47.520
We just kind of went into it right off.

01:42:47.520 --> 01:42:48.520
Oh no.

01:42:48.520 --> 01:42:49.520
Okay.

01:42:49.520 --> 01:42:52.400
So I looked angry.

01:42:52.400 --> 01:42:56.960
So did you end up doing the play on Saturday anyway?

01:42:56.960 --> 01:42:58.120
Yeah.

01:42:58.120 --> 01:43:07.260
On Saturday, um, I left for the play, you know, went there, um, and the play actually

01:43:07.260 --> 01:43:08.260
went great.

01:43:08.260 --> 01:43:12.780
So, that was good, you know, my dad didn't go the second night because he was sick, and

01:43:12.780 --> 01:43:15.180
I didn't realize how sick he was.

01:43:15.180 --> 01:43:16.180
Uh oh.

01:43:16.180 --> 01:43:19.820
Yeah, I'm going to say, I think he drank the water.

01:43:19.820 --> 01:43:23.420
Oh no, in Mexico.

01:43:23.420 --> 01:43:25.420
Yeah, um

01:43:25.420 --> 01:43:32.740
So I was at the cast party, which was half-assed because there were only like four people at the party

01:43:33.420 --> 01:43:39.460
and we're talking, you know, we're talking about getting flowers from our parents and I'm like, yeah, I didn't get any and

01:43:40.640 --> 01:43:42.900
My sister leads me off to the side

01:43:43.880 --> 01:43:45.420
She's like

01:43:45.420 --> 01:43:47.420
Here's why we didn't get you flowers

01:43:47.420 --> 01:43:55.360
because we found dad laying on the bathroom floor and this is starting to

01:43:55.360 --> 01:43:58.760
sound more and more like an early fu of the week in a way like this whole thing

01:43:58.760 --> 01:44:04.340
is just like and oh my gosh I'd be so pissed yeah I was pretty pissed off

01:44:04.340 --> 01:44:08.400

want to bring Dark Sakura back at some point as well but we're running behind

on our other stuff and the stuff we've got to get to this week and of course

01:45:26.800 --> 01:45:30.760
you know it just wouldn't be a show if we didn't have ourselves a little bit of

01:45:30.760 --> 01:45:32.760
of a cage match.

01:46:00.760 --> 01:46:09.200
The song is called Precious and it's our winner.

01:46:09.200 --> 01:46:13.280
Remember the way the Cage Match works is that we play three songs for you guys.

01:46:13.280 --> 01:46:17.760
We play a clip of the previous winner and two new songs in full for you guys.

01:46:17.760 --> 01:46:21.240
You guys vote for your favorite in our chatroom at orangebonnetradio.com and that winner goes

01:46:21.240 --> 01:46:26.160
in a rotation all week long on Orange Bonnet Radio's video game music and more program.

01:46:26.160 --> 01:46:27.160
Here it is!

01:46:27.160 --> 01:46:28.360
Song number one tonight in the Cage Match.

01:46:28.360 --> 01:46:35.360
a clip of Precious by Depeche Mode.

01:46:58.360 --> 01:47:08.360
Things get damaged, things get broken I thought we'd manage, but what that does for me

01:47:08.360 --> 01:47:14.360
Left on the Britain, there was no Britain left to do

01:47:14.360 --> 01:47:40.200
Angels with silver wings Should have no suffering

01:47:40.200 --> 01:47:44.200
I wish I could take the pain for you

01:47:49.200 --> 01:47:52.200
If God has a master plan

01:47:53.200 --> 01:47:57.200
That only He understands

01:47:58.200 --> 01:48:01.200
I hope that your eyes are seeing

01:48:01.200 --> 01:48:19.200
Things get damaged, things get broken I thought we'd vanish, but words left unspoken Left us so pretty

01:48:19.200 --> 01:48:22.200
There was a little left to you

01:48:22.200 --> 01:48:33.160
Okay, that was song number one in tonight's cage match, Depeche Mode with Precious.

01:48:33.160 --> 01:48:35.200
Alright, we're going to get into song number two now.

01:48:35.200 --> 01:48:38.840
This is actually Darkstalker's pick and unfortunately she's unable to call us back right now and

01:48:38.840 --> 01:48:42.960
intro it herself, but from what we understand, it sounds like Roz has something to do with

01:48:42.960 --> 01:48:47.720
this pick, so maybe she's doing that trick that I did last month when I had Miklotov

01:48:47.720 --> 01:48:52.040
pick one of my songs and it went all the way to retirement, so we'll see.

01:48:52.040 --> 01:48:56.800
dark soccer have the same watch we'll see song number two is Cali Hall by

01:48:56.800 --> 01:49:00.320
banana man enjoy

01:49:04.600 --> 01:49:13.960
do you see banana man hopping over on the white arts and they come with some

01:49:13.960 --> 01:49:23.680
for me? Freshly taken from banana tree. Banana man me, want it done. Give me double and a

01:49:23.680 --> 01:49:32.920
bonus one. Give me more for all me friends. This banana flow will never end. Do you want

01:49:32.920 --> 01:49:43.920
a banana? Peel it down and go mmm mmm mmm. Do you want a banana? This banana for you.

01:49:43.920 --> 01:49:50.920
Tonight we dance around the flame Then we get to play the spirit game

01:49:50.920 --> 01:49:57.920
Spirit names we shout out loud Shake the thunder from the spirit cloud

01:49:57.920 --> 01:50:03.920
All the songbirds in the tree Chant a tune to let the spirits free

01:50:03.920 --> 01:50:10.920
Then we see them in the night Spirit's dropping by the firelight

01:50:10.920 --> 01:50:13.920
Do you want a banana?

01:50:13.920 --> 01:50:16.920
Feel it down low

01:50:17.920 --> 01:50:20.920
Do you want a banana?

01:50:20.920 --> 01:50:23.920
This banana for you

01:50:28.920 --> 01:50:30.920
Look you, you're too uptight you know

01:50:30.920 --> 01:50:32.920
You could laugh and kick it back and go

01:50:32.920 --> 01:50:34.920
But without a rhythm or a rhyme

01:50:34.920 --> 01:50:37.920
You do not banana all the time

01:50:37.920 --> 01:50:39.920
Fly away from city on the run

01:50:39.920 --> 01:50:41.920
Tried to make a little fun

01:50:46.920 --> 01:50:48.920
Look, you come to me from below

01:50:48.920 --> 01:50:50.920
Happy times, you tell me, don't you so

01:50:50.920 --> 01:50:52.920
Don't you love me, bumping up your tongue

01:50:52.920 --> 01:50:54.920
Make a shame until we bumble

01:50:54.920 --> 01:50:56.920
I mean, there's even no play until you drop

01:50:56.920 --> 01:50:58.920
At least when I run, never stop

01:51:03.920 --> 01:51:05.920
Forget all your troubles and goatee flow

01:51:05.920 --> 01:51:07.920
Forget about whatever you may never know

01:51:07.920 --> 01:51:10.120
Like whether whatever you're doing is whatever you should

01:51:10.120 --> 01:51:11.920
And whether anything you feel is ever anything

01:51:11.920 --> 01:51:13.520
But wouldn't that forget about banana

01:51:13.520 --> 01:51:14.520
When they stick in your throat

01:51:14.520 --> 01:51:15.720
And when they make you want a bell

01:51:15.720 --> 01:51:16.720
Or when you're stuck in a choke

01:51:16.720 --> 01:51:18.920
And you forget about the yellow from the colorful man

01:51:18.920 --> 01:51:19.920
And if you take another one

01:51:19.920 --> 01:51:21.920
Then make a mark on your old land

01:51:28.120 --> 01:51:30.120
Fungalay, Fungalow

01:51:30.120 --> 01:51:48.880
Well, it's nine o'clock and it's getting dark And the sun is falling from the sky

01:51:48.880 --> 01:51:55.880
I've never left so early and you may wonder why

01:52:18.880 --> 01:52:36.000
Tomorrow morning on this plane No banana make you go insane

01:52:36.000 --> 01:52:42.640
Lookin' back to Busytown, no banana make you want to frown

01:52:42.640 --> 01:52:49.280
Do you want a banana? Feel it now, oh

01:52:49.280 --> 01:52:58.880
Do you want a banana? Eat banana for...

01:52:58.880 --> 01:53:02.880
you

01:53:22.880 --> 01:53:27.880
Song number two in tonight's stage match

01:53:27.880 --> 01:53:34.880
Tallyhowl with the Banana Man. Let's go around and see if that song is banana-rific or if it's just plain rotten.

01:53:34.880 --> 01:53:35.880
Angel.

01:53:35.880 --> 01:53:39.880
I was the only one that started giggling when it started playing. I was like, oh my god!

01:53:39.880 --> 01:53:40.880
Did you know it was in the video, apparently?

01:53:40.880 --> 01:53:41.880
Of course.

01:53:41.880 --> 01:53:42.880
What did you think?

01:53:42.880 --> 01:53:46.880
Um, yeah, the cat room is right here. It's in the video.

01:53:46.880 --> 01:53:47.880
Okay.

01:53:47.880 --> 01:53:54.880
But, um, I just didn't think it said just because it's funny, but, oh, what the hell. I'll give it a 10.

01:53:54.880 --> 01:53:57.880
Alright, ten from Angel.

01:53:57.880 --> 01:54:03.880
I'm gonna kind of agree that there's something there where apparently I'm not getting something because I haven't seen the video.

01:54:03.880 --> 01:54:08.880
But I'll take a leap of faith there. I don't know so much about the cage match, though. It's not...

01:54:08.880 --> 01:54:13.880
It seems like more of the thing that would have been unfortunate. But I don't know. Whatever. It was okay.

01:54:13.880 --> 01:54:16.880
I give it an okay score of a seven.

01:54:16.880 --> 01:54:18.880
Melody!

01:54:18.880 --> 01:54:23.880
I, I, I, I just don't get it.

01:54:23.880 --> 01:54:27.880
Okay, okay, I'll post the video in my live journal so everyone can get it.

01:54:27.880 --> 01:54:29.880
Of course it doesn't!

01:54:29.880 --> 01:54:31.880
For later!

01:54:31.880 --> 01:54:33.880
I give it an F.

01:54:33.880 --> 01:54:35.880
No.

01:54:35.880 --> 01:54:37.880
Um, if when some money could stay a thing, she would say,

01:54:37.880 --> 01:54:39.880
that banana was shit.

01:54:39.880 --> 01:54:42.880
I give it a one.

01:54:42.880 --> 01:54:44.880
Loki.

01:54:44.880 --> 01:54:47.880
I'm sorry, but the cage match does not require video,

01:54:47.880 --> 01:54:52.880
So, based on the song alone, it sucked balls, and it gets a one.

01:54:52.880 --> 01:54:54.880
Alright.

01:54:54.880 --> 01:55:00.880
And, uh, DarkSakura is actually in chat right now, she's yelling at me, she gives it a score of 11-T.

01:55:00.880 --> 01:55:02.880
And it says, Ba-na-na.

01:55:02.880 --> 01:55:06.880
Unfortunately, 11-T is not a number, therefore it's zero.

01:55:06.880 --> 01:55:07.880
Stop.

01:55:07.880 --> 01:55:09.880
Alright.

01:55:09.880 --> 01:55:13.880
Um, moving on. Song number three in tonight's cage match.

01:55:13.880 --> 01:55:15.880
Uh, Loki, what the hell did you bring to the table today?

01:55:15.880 --> 01:55:21.880
I don't remember if I put this in the cage match or not, but this song sounds like a good song that would be for a guitar hero.

01:55:21.880 --> 01:55:29.880
It's like a kickass song. It features a guitarist by the name of John Sykes who is also in Whitesnake and some other bands.

01:55:29.880 --> 01:55:35.880
This is actually a theme song to an anime. Whitesnake sounds awesome to me. It's badass.

01:55:35.880 --> 01:55:38.880
John Sykes with cautionary warning.

01:55:38.880 --> 01:55:39.880
Yes, here it is.

01:55:39.880 --> 01:55:41.880
Ed Short. Enjoy, kids.

01:56:09.880 --> 01:56:12.880
I'm gonna shoot every wall that I put through

01:56:22.880 --> 01:56:24.880
Mr. Boy, you were put in good form with the line

01:56:24.880 --> 01:56:26.880
So he told me the dark of old is time

01:56:26.880 --> 01:56:28.880
Now only time will tell

01:56:28.880 --> 01:56:31.880
Will he take you down or will you pull through?

01:56:31.880 --> 01:56:34.880
The tiger boy has put the burden in fire but now he's dead

01:56:34.880 --> 01:56:36.880
Now you're falling for the test

01:56:36.880 --> 01:56:37.880
Now only time will tell

01:57:07.880 --> 01:57:35.880
You are my excavator, you are my excavator You are my place to break up, so I shall never

01:58:05.880 --> 01:58:08.380
Like a voice in the darkness of the night

01:58:08.380 --> 01:58:10.880
Telling tales that become what you describe

01:58:10.880 --> 01:58:12.380
Cause only the time will tell

01:58:12.380 --> 01:58:13.880
Will you take me down?

01:58:13.880 --> 01:58:15.380
How?

01:58:15.380 --> 01:58:17.380
You are my indicator

01:58:17.380 --> 01:58:19.380
You are my incubator

01:58:19.380 --> 01:58:21.380
You are my space invader

01:58:21.380 --> 01:58:23.380
You are your every warning

01:58:23.380 --> 01:58:24.380
I will prove

01:58:24.380 --> 01:58:13.280
You are my

01:58:26.380 --> 01:58:27.380
You are my

01:58:28.880 --> 01:58:29.880
You are my

01:58:30.880 --> 01:58:32.380
You are your every warning

01:58:32.380 --> 01:58:33.380
I will prove

01:58:33.380 --> 01:58:35.380
Talking about the eyes of danger

01:58:35.380 --> 01:58:37.380
Time to beat your back with action

01:58:37.380 --> 01:58:39.380
Voices out my head

01:58:39.380 --> 01:58:41.380
Don't you think you'll stay

01:58:41.380 --> 01:58:43.380
Well, I bet you'll be to the act

01:58:43.380 --> 01:58:45.380
But I just don't want to recognize

01:58:45.380 --> 01:58:47.380
You just don't want to tell

01:58:47.380 --> 01:58:48.380
No one's in question

01:58:48.380 --> 01:58:50.380
No one's in question once again

01:58:50.380 --> 01:58:52.380
But I don't know what's the mental fact

01:58:52.380 --> 01:58:55.380
And no one knows just where or what they're at

01:58:55.380 --> 01:58:57.380
And anytime of the day

01:58:57.380 --> 01:58:59.380
No one left to say

01:58:59.380 --> 01:59:16.380
Song number three is John Sykes with Cautionary Warning. Let's go around and see what everybody

01:59:16.380 --> 01:59:18.380
thought of that one. Uh, Angel?

01:59:18.380 --> 01:59:26.380
Uh, it was good. Um, eight and a half.

01:59:26.380 --> 01:59:30.380
There was no White Snake, that's for damn sure. Five. Melody.

01:59:30.380 --> 01:59:35.380
That was freakin' cool, and now I wanna go play Guitar Hero. Uh, nine.

01:59:35.380 --> 01:59:36.380
No.

01:59:38.380 --> 01:59:39.380
I got my voice cracked, I'm going with a few beats.

01:59:39.380 --> 01:59:42.380
Definitely, you know, got like the ass-kicking 80's, you know, vibe to it.

01:59:42.380 --> 01:59:47.380
You know, I was just waiting for Jean-Claude Van Damme to like beat someone's ass or something, but...

01:59:47.380 --> 01:59:51.380
Yeah, overall it was pretty cool, I give it a... I give it an 8.7.

01:59:51.380 --> 01:59:52.380
Uh, Loki.

01:59:52.380 --> 01:59:58.380
It's badass. It's ten. It's gonna be really friggin' hard in like any guitar game.

01:59:58.380 --> 01:59:59.380
Alright.

01:59:59.380 --> 02:00:04.380
DarkSakura says, uh, you get an automatic zero for being rude earlier.

02:00:04.380 --> 02:00:06.380
Oh!

02:00:06.380 --> 02:00:08.380
Got big crappy songs then.

02:00:08.380 --> 02:00:11.380
Oh snap. Oh snap.

02:00:11.380 --> 02:00:15.380
I gave her song a higher score than I gave your song. That was not why.

02:00:15.380 --> 02:00:21.380
You misrepresented that song by making me think it would be like Whitesnake.

02:00:21.380 --> 02:00:23.380
I said he was in YSING! I didn't say he was in YSING!

02:00:23.380 --> 02:00:25.380
It was misrepresenting!

02:00:25.380 --> 02:00:27.380
It was misrepresenting! I demand a free trial.

02:00:27.380 --> 02:00:29.380
Alright.

02:00:29.380 --> 02:00:33.380
Let's recap the three songs you can vote for tonight, shall we?

02:00:33.380 --> 02:00:37.380
We'll start off with song number one that you can vote for tonight is...

02:00:37.380 --> 02:00:43.380
Depeche Mode with Precious, if I can find it in my list here.

02:00:43.380 --> 02:00:45.380
That was a really good song on that CD too.

02:00:45.380 --> 02:00:49.380
That worries me that I cannot suddenly find Depeche Mode with Precious. Here we go!

02:00:49.380 --> 02:00:56.380
Let's try this again. Song number one was Precious by Depeche Mode.

02:00:58.800 --> 02:01:03.560
Alright, song number two you can vote for tonight is Tally Hall with

02:01:03.560 --> 02:01:10.560
Banana Man.

02:01:10.560 --> 02:01:19.120
And song number three you can vote for tonight is John Sykes with Cautionary Warning.

02:01:19.120 --> 02:01:31.160
All right kids, place, vote now, send a private message to Sky with your vote for song number

02:01:31.160 --> 02:01:34.760
one, song number two, or if you're so inclined, song number three.

02:01:34.760 --> 02:01:35.760
It's your choice.

02:01:35.760 --> 02:01:36.760
Send a vote in right now.

02:01:36.760 --> 02:01:37.760
Private message to Sky.

02:01:37.760 --> 02:01:38.760
Do it!

02:01:38.760 --> 02:01:39.760
All right.

02:01:39.760 --> 02:01:45.760
Meanwhile, let's go over to Loki real quick. What is going on in the sim scene, if I dare ask?

02:01:45.760 --> 02:01:50.760
A few things. The first being really cool, and that would be PSP Revolution.

02:01:50.760 --> 02:01:54.760
And it's basically kind of a port of StepMania for the PSP.

02:01:54.760 --> 02:01:59.760
And you can play your sim files on that. The only thing it doesn't support right now is modifiers,

02:01:59.760 --> 02:02:04.760
so that's not in there, but at least it plays and it works, and it's pretty fun.

02:02:04.760 --> 02:02:09.460
you know, best you can do with Controller Controller Revolution, so. You can actually

02:02:09.460 --> 02:02:13.320
download that. We have a link on our website to where you can download that. It's pretty

02:02:13.320 --> 02:02:16.560
awesome. It actually comes with a couple CIN file packs in there so you can check out some

02:02:16.560 --> 02:02:23.920
songs. But yeah, so far, not bad for our first release. And that's about it, that's pretty

02:02:23.920 --> 02:02:30.420
much about it. All the important stuff at least. All right. Oops, my help with my mic

02:02:30.420 --> 02:02:34.020
was on. All right, now what we're going to do is do a little segment of the program we

02:02:34.020 --> 02:02:40.900
we call Orange Lounge Radio goes to the movies! Yay! Movie! Movie! Please note that this is

02:02:40.900 --> 02:02:43.740
different from Extraverse Movie Review, which he will be doing later in the show, I just

02:02:43.740 --> 02:02:50.820
want to say though. However, we like to sometimes watch a movie together and comment on it for

02:02:50.820 --> 02:02:55.740
you guys. And the movie we're going to be commenting on this week is a news article

02:02:55.740 --> 02:02:59.920
that was recently, or actually not really an article, a news broadcast that was recently

02:02:59.920 --> 02:03:07.480
on our local television station. It was WB-58, and it was Loki and Dark Sakura lending their

02:03:07.480 --> 02:03:12.620
expert opinions on Guitar Hero. So let's check this out, shall we? I'm going to bring up

02:03:12.620 --> 02:03:17.380
this video in studio. But of course, for those of you guys out there in internet radio land,

02:03:17.380 --> 02:03:22.840
you guys will get to hear the audio of this, and we will interject as need be with comments.

02:03:22.840 --> 02:03:23.840
So here we go.

02:03:23.840 --> 02:03:26.560
Thank you. Well, a question I have for you is, have you ever secretly dreamed of being

02:03:26.560 --> 02:03:29.040
a rock star, wailing on your electric guitar to...

02:03:29.040 --> 02:03:35.040
I dream of that every night. Actually, there's nothing I love more than getting up on the bed and wailing like a rock star.

02:03:35.040 --> 02:03:41.040
...sold out crowd. Well, for most people, the closest they'll ever get to playing is an air guitar in their living room.

02:03:41.040 --> 02:03:42.040
Ooh!

02:03:42.040 --> 02:03:45.040
With a new video game called Guitar Hero, just released today.

02:03:45.040 --> 02:03:51.040
In other words, you can't afford this crap. We're showing this to you because, you know, we're rich and famous.

02:03:51.040 --> 02:03:55.040
It's designed to get wannabe rockers closer to the real stage experience.

02:03:55.040 --> 02:04:04.040
Brian Hickey rocks on. He asks the producers of the demo guitar hero for a couple of local gamers, so we can get their reactions. Rock on.

02:04:25.040 --> 02:04:29.720
something else and I forgot now, so we'll just let it keep going. Oh, I was going to say something about the gamers.

02:04:29.720 --> 02:04:33.440
Apparently Loki and DarkSakura are now the expert gamers in town.

02:04:33.440 --> 02:04:35.480
Local crazed gamer!

02:04:35.480 --> 02:04:39.360
Yeah, uh, which, which, uh, you know, Rio's stationery part of.

02:04:39.360 --> 02:04:42.680
Oh, that's why we can't mention that. Yeah, that's why. They don't ever say that it's Orange

02:04:42.680 --> 02:04:45.640
Lounge Radio, by the way. Never. It's just the two expert gamers.

02:04:45.640 --> 02:04:52.000
Two crazed gamers. I'm wearing a t-shirt next time. I tell you, if I had a shirt. Seriously, me too.

02:04:52.000 --> 02:04:59.000
The box office is sold out, your guitar is tuned, and you're about to play one of the

02:04:59.000 --> 02:05:01.240
greatest rock songs of all time.

02:05:01.240 --> 02:05:04.600
For the longest time during this interview, I thought that was going to be the only thing

02:05:04.600 --> 02:05:05.600
I had to say.

02:05:05.600 --> 02:05:06.600
Let's see here.

02:05:06.600 --> 02:05:09.600
By the way, are you chewing gum?

02:05:09.600 --> 02:05:10.600
I'm not chewing gum.

02:05:10.600 --> 02:05:11.600
Oh no, your cheeks are just puffy.

02:05:11.600 --> 02:05:12.600
I guess that's what it is.

02:05:12.600 --> 02:05:13.600
I'm just kidding.

02:05:13.600 --> 02:05:14.600
I'm just kidding.

02:05:14.600 --> 02:05:15.600
Listen, asshole.

02:05:15.600 --> 02:05:22.600
an asshole. Just because I took time off your work to come play this stupid game.

02:05:22.600 --> 02:05:26.600
I thought you liked the game. You give it a good score later.

02:05:26.600 --> 02:05:34.600
Oh yeah, I give it a good score, but you know what? I had to drive like a freaking half an hour during my lunch break to come play this game.

02:05:34.600 --> 02:05:36.600
Whatever.

02:05:39.600 --> 02:05:44.600
That's the idea behind Red Octane's new guitar hero.

02:05:44.600 --> 02:05:50.600
Rock music inspired this game, so having full length songs is really important.

02:05:50.600 --> 02:05:56.600
Game producer John Tam shows Jamie Devrend and Matt Whiteman, two avid gamers, how to play.

02:05:56.600 --> 02:05:59.600
I didn't know how to play this before you showed me, dumbass.

02:05:59.600 --> 02:06:01.600
Hey now, hey now.

02:06:01.600 --> 02:06:07.600
No chords to learn. To create music, John presses colored fret buttons to match those on the screen

02:06:07.600 --> 02:06:13.600
while hitting the strum bar once for each note. The goal? Nail as many notes as you can to rack up the high score.

02:06:13.600 --> 02:06:18.300
high score. See, now that guy thought ahead, he's wearing his Guitar Hero shirt on. So,

02:06:18.300 --> 02:06:21.120
you're right, we need to get orange lounge shirts for all these reasons, for all the

02:06:21.120 --> 02:06:25.840
media whoredom. If I don't play anything, the guitar track doesn't play. And if I hit

02:06:25.840 --> 02:06:29.640
this thing... Go figure that that would happen, that when you don't play anything, the guitar

02:06:29.640 --> 02:06:33.600
track won't play. Go figure. I'm just giving this poor guy a hard time. And if you fuck

02:06:33.600 --> 02:06:40.160
up a lot, then you start doing the jig and then you walk off stage. You get these trashy

02:06:40.160 --> 02:06:44.400
Each guitar guru character has its own extroverted personality.

02:06:44.400 --> 02:06:47.960
There's Pandora, princess of rock, and punk virtuoso

02:06:47.960 --> 02:06:52.480
Johnny Napalm, among others. I love the Ramones, so I played I Wanna Be Sedated.

02:06:52.480 --> 02:06:55.840
She's lying, she really loves the gorillas.

02:06:55.840 --> 02:06:59.840
She doesn't, she's, no I'm just... Who doesn't love the Ramones? The Ramones are awesome.

02:06:59.840 --> 02:07:03.240
That, by the way, that was the little clip that they used in the commercial, but I think what's

02:07:03.240 --> 02:07:04.680
great about this, watch

02:07:04.680 --> 02:07:07.600
how they do, and I know this is horrible for the radio, but watch how they do this

02:07:07.600 --> 02:07:10.900
next little clip like in beat with the music after she says she loves the Ramones and she's

02:07:10.900 --> 02:07:11.900
playing here.

02:07:11.900 --> 02:07:19.360
And I'm looking bored in the background.

02:07:19.360 --> 02:07:21.080
The solos usually kill people.

02:07:21.080 --> 02:07:23.040
Then she discovers the whammy bar.

02:07:23.040 --> 02:07:26.000
The whammy bar, whammy bar.

02:07:26.000 --> 02:07:29.920
And then she discovered my whammy bar.

02:07:29.920 --> 02:07:30.920
I hate...

02:07:30.920 --> 02:07:32.160
The whammy bar is my favorite part.

02:07:32.160 --> 02:07:36.480
I don't know why the hell I decided to be in these stupid news interviews because they're

02:07:36.480 --> 02:07:42.200
really bad. No, they're only bad when I bring them on the radio and start, you know, making

02:07:42.200 --> 02:07:46.240
fun of them. It's just, it's embarrassing. It's embarrassing. Because I love, I tease

02:07:46.240 --> 02:07:52.320
because I love to make fun of you. It does nothing for our station. It's like, it's like

02:07:52.320 --> 02:07:56.280
gymnastics, you have to land that last note. I love how like Jamie's taking the guitar

02:07:56.280 --> 02:08:00.880
off, this guy's talking like, get this fucking thing out of here. No, I'm kidding. Keep going.

02:08:00.880 --> 02:08:05.400
This is funny. To give you the experience of being on stage, this room takes you inside

02:08:05.400 --> 02:08:09.340
the different venues, from practice rooms and basements to sold out stadiums, and the

02:08:09.340 --> 02:08:13.560
fans react, jumping up and down when you rock the house or letting you know if you're playing

02:08:13.560 --> 02:08:14.560
stinks.

02:08:14.560 --> 02:08:18.360
Xtifer, wasn't this the same reporter you thought was cute?

02:08:18.360 --> 02:08:23.240
Yeah, I still think he's cute.

02:08:23.240 --> 02:08:27.120
You don't play well, they don't like you, they'll start leaving the venue and start

02:08:27.120 --> 02:08:31.120
booing you, and then eventually if you die, your whole band gives up and throws their

02:08:31.120 --> 02:08:35.520
hands up in frustration against you.

02:08:35.520 --> 02:08:38.840
See I don't understand that because you know in the real world violin keeps

02:08:38.840 --> 02:08:40.560
lasting on but can they sing

02:08:40.560 --> 02:08:46.040
and yet, never mind, nobody's going to understand that joke.

02:08:46.040 --> 02:08:50.120
Matt likes the fact that Guitar Hero offers different rock genres to explore.

02:08:50.120 --> 02:08:53.720
By the way that's my DDR pad in the background, that's my cameo in the story.

02:08:53.720 --> 02:08:57.880
That's my dance pad lying there unloved in the background.

02:08:57.880 --> 02:09:02.320
I don't even know why I had my dance pads there but I think

02:09:02.320 --> 02:09:06.960
is it oh yes it's the old red octane pad though. From classic rock and hard rock to

02:09:06.960 --> 02:09:07.500
modern

02:09:07.500 --> 02:09:11.200
punk even blues. Fun game. Really fun game.

02:09:11.200 --> 02:09:14.640
To kick his song into high gear Matt tilts the guitar up

02:09:14.640 --> 02:09:18.760
activating star power which allows him to rack up even more points.

02:09:18.760 --> 02:09:22.640
Really good party game I mean especially you know get a bunch of friends together

02:09:22.640 --> 02:09:23.200
just

02:09:23.200 --> 02:09:26.640
you know don't see it, smash up some music. Don't see it. Don't see it. Really fun.

02:09:26.640 --> 02:09:29.640
So how do you do these two gamers, right, guitar hero?

02:09:29.640 --> 02:09:31.640
I'd definitely say it's at least an 8 out of a 10.

02:09:31.640 --> 02:09:32.640
And Jamie?

02:09:32.640 --> 02:09:34.640
Now, see, I could clip that and use that for some great problems.

02:09:34.640 --> 02:09:38.640
I'd definitely say it's at least an 8 out of 10.

02:09:38.640 --> 02:09:41.640
So, Loki, how big is Skye's penis?

02:09:41.640 --> 02:09:46.640
I'd definitely say it's at least an 8 out of 10.

02:09:46.640 --> 02:09:49.640
There's so much I could do with this.

02:09:49.640 --> 02:09:51.640
Oh, 11.

02:09:51.640 --> 02:09:52.640
What's with that?

02:09:52.640 --> 02:09:53.640
Yeah, she had to go...

02:09:53.640 --> 02:09:54.640
Where's Jamie in the 11s lately?

02:09:54.640 --> 02:09:55.640
She had to go one...

02:09:55.640 --> 02:10:03.640
They set a scale of 1 to 10. I was basically giving a ranking within the criteria that they had, and she had to go out of the criteria.

02:10:03.640 --> 02:10:06.640
I don't know. It wasn't an 11 game for me or whatever.

02:10:06.640 --> 02:10:08.640
I like the game. I like the musical.

02:10:08.640 --> 02:10:12.640
It's just completely rocking out. It feels like playing an actual guitar.

02:10:12.640 --> 02:10:16.640
Yeah, they show it. They let her talk, and they paraphrase me.

02:10:16.640 --> 02:10:22.640
Brian Hickey, WB58 News at 10.

02:10:22.640 --> 02:10:25.640
Well, maybe what she's saying is more intelligent as opposed to,

02:10:25.640 --> 02:10:27.640
It's so fun!

02:10:27.640 --> 02:10:30.640
Oh man, I just got the death stare.

02:10:30.640 --> 02:10:35.640
This, by the way, will be the last episode on this video.

02:10:35.640 --> 02:10:39.640
Alright, anyway, let's see what the two goons on the TV have to say about this.

02:10:39.640 --> 02:10:41.640
You gotta love playing that air guitar.

02:10:41.640 --> 02:10:43.640
I'd like to have that mohawk going on.

02:10:43.640 --> 02:10:45.640
Well, Guitar Hero is designed to be played on PlayStation.

02:10:45.640 --> 02:10:48.640
By the way, he's talking about his pubic hair right there. I'd like to have that mohawk going on.

02:10:48.640 --> 02:10:50.640
Two, and it cost about $70.

02:10:50.640 --> 02:10:53.640
Stay with us. More to come right after the break.

02:10:53.640 --> 02:11:03.640
They did also, I want to add, they also did a story apparently about In the Groove and how people are losing weight on it.

02:11:03.640 --> 02:11:10.640
To which I could basically go, so you're recycling news now?

02:11:10.640 --> 02:11:13.200
didn't I didn't see the in the groove story and I didn't get we weren't part

02:11:13.200 --> 02:11:16.880
of it so I didn't bother to tape it but I would have laughed if they wanted me

02:11:16.880 --> 02:11:20.360
to play this game so what do you give in the groove well well originally in the

02:11:20.360 --> 02:11:24.680
original email I thought that that was because that's why I hyped it up like I

02:11:24.680 --> 02:11:27.720
did is that you're never gonna believe what Loki and dark soccer are gonna be

02:11:27.720 --> 02:11:30.840
doing on the news because originally it was supposed to be for in the groove and

02:11:30.840 --> 02:11:35.280
guitar hero but I guess something got fixed yeah I would have been cut off TV

02:11:35.280 --> 02:11:39.320
for that yeah all right anyway we're gonna go to another break one more break

02:11:39.320 --> 02:11:42.480
here of Ultramix 3 music and then we're going to come back and we're going to reveal the

02:11:42.480 --> 02:11:47.760
winner of tonight's cage match. We will also get into the FUs of the week and do extra

02:11:47.760 --> 02:11:51.320
first movie review. We can't forget that. So don't send your FUs just yet though because

02:11:51.320 --> 02:11:56.080
I haven't tallied cage match votes but this is the last opportunity for you guys to get

02:11:56.080 --> 02:11:59.600
your stuff into the cage match and everything you want to vote for there. Alright, we're

02:11:59.600 --> 02:12:02.640
going to go into this break and in this break I think we're going to start it off with the

02:12:02.640 --> 02:12:09.640
brand new Naoki track from DDR Ultramix 3. This is Naoki with Brilliant Red.

02:12:32.640 --> 02:12:45.640
I knew the first time I saw you out on the floor

02:12:45.640 --> 02:12:48.640
Said you were so much more

02:12:48.640 --> 02:12:52.640
It's just the way that you move your body with mine

02:12:52.640 --> 02:12:55.640
Feels like we had no concept of time

02:12:55.640 --> 02:12:59.640
It's just the way that you grew, that's what we do

02:12:59.640 --> 02:13:04.640
I wanna show you how much we can move

02:13:05.640 --> 02:13:08.640
This is the night made for just you and I

02:13:08.640 --> 02:13:11.640
This is the night, won't you take me inside?

02:13:11.640 --> 02:13:14.640
This is the night, now look into my eyes

02:13:14.640 --> 02:13:17.640
I want you, I need you to make it alright

02:13:17.640 --> 02:13:21.640
Let's dance tonight like the last of our lives

02:13:21.640 --> 02:13:24.640
Let's dance tonight, won't you know you were kind?

02:13:24.640 --> 02:13:27.640
Let's dance tonight, made for just you and I

02:13:27.640 --> 02:13:34.640
I want you, I need you, my whole life I want you

02:13:57.640 --> 02:14:12.040
Too many words on the tip of my tongue and I can never figure out

02:14:12.040 --> 02:14:15.560
When to speak, when to shout, when to shut up

02:14:15.560 --> 02:14:17.560
When to knock myself out

02:14:17.560 --> 02:14:22.440
I need a brainwash, cream and a bath I need the butter all thrown in the trash

02:14:22.440 --> 02:14:27.320
I need a brainwash, cause I'm a loon So could you please throw my head in a tub

02:14:27.320 --> 02:14:35.320
I can really use a cerebral scrub Wash away what I know It's an overrated frontal lobe

02:14:43.320 --> 02:14:52.320
Too many words on the tip of my tongue and I can never figure out When to speak, when to shout, when to shut up When to knock myself out

02:14:52.320 --> 02:14:53.320
Brainwash!

02:14:53.320 --> 02:14:55.320
I need a brainwash, green matter fast

02:14:55.320 --> 02:14:58.320
I need to clutter up, run in the trash

02:14:58.320 --> 02:15:00.320
I need a brainwash, cause I'm a woon

02:15:00.320 --> 02:15:02.320
Cause of the spike of pebble brain

02:15:02.320 --> 02:15:04.320
I'm really moving to the midst of many air

02:15:04.320 --> 02:15:07.320
I'm trying to find what's a pussy in a room

02:15:07.320 --> 02:15:09.320
Right here's your nickel pin and candy for a gene

02:15:09.320 --> 02:15:12.320
Cause I wanna do a sing to an angel

02:15:12.320 --> 02:15:14.320
Something I like to sing in minor technology

02:15:14.320 --> 02:15:17.320
Nothing needs a duck to just lean on my head in a tuck

02:15:17.320 --> 02:15:20.320
I could really use just a river or a truck

02:15:20.320 --> 02:15:25.320
Watch your way when I know It's been overrated pronto-mo

02:15:25.320 --> 02:15:44.720
So many times I'm watching you And now I fell in love with you

02:15:44.720 --> 02:15:52.320
So many times, so many times

02:15:52.320 --> 02:16:16.320
Do your heart, feel so lonely, think about your sweetest dreams

02:16:16.320 --> 02:16:24.320
Close your eyes and follow me And I take you to my destiny

02:16:24.320 --> 02:16:32.320
I'm thinking about you all the time When I keep my love to you, that's the time

02:16:32.320 --> 02:16:38.320
So many times I've been watching you And now I fell in love with you

02:16:38.320 --> 02:16:41.320
Oh, I want you

02:16:41.320 --> 02:16:45.320
And now I'm fell in love with you

02:16:45.320 --> 02:16:49.320
With you, yeah

02:16:49.320 --> 02:16:52.320
So many times

02:16:52.320 --> 02:16:56.320
Oh, I want you

02:16:56.320 --> 02:17:00.320
And now I'm fell in love with you

02:17:00.320 --> 02:17:03.320
So many times

02:17:03.320 --> 02:17:07.320
So many times

02:17:07.320 --> 02:17:10.320
Get up and let the best you can make come

02:17:20.320 --> 02:17:25.320
I'm in love and love is what I like

02:17:27.320 --> 02:17:32.320
Spin me, shape me, make me feel alright

02:17:32.320 --> 02:17:39.320
I'm in love and love is what I like

02:17:39.320 --> 02:17:46.320
Lifting my imperfection

02:17:46.320 --> 02:17:53.320
Waiting for your direction

02:17:53.320 --> 02:18:08.320
I'm in love, I'm in love, and it's what I like

02:18:08.320 --> 02:18:17.320
And you shake me, make me feel alright

02:18:17.320 --> 02:18:32.320
This is my imperfection, waiting for your direction

02:18:32.320 --> 02:18:39.320
This ain't no thing I feel alright, my imperfection

02:18:39.320 --> 02:18:43.320
If you want to save my day, I'm gonna give you a ride

02:18:43.320 --> 02:18:53.720
After this song, we'll be having a Let Them Move Marathon.

02:18:53.720 --> 02:18:54.720
Nooooooo!

02:18:54.720 --> 02:19:00.120
Just kidding, Orange Lounge Radio, crap-free bovani radio.

02:19:00.120 --> 02:19:02.600
Welcome back, boys and girls, to Orange Lounge Radio.

02:19:02.600 --> 02:19:06.440
I bet you kids are just dying to know who won tonight's cage match, aren't ya?

02:19:06.440 --> 02:19:09.680
You're just dying to know, you just wanna know so badly.

02:19:09.680 --> 02:19:13.440
Here it is, the wiener of tonight's cage match tonight is...

02:19:13.440 --> 02:19:23.840
John Sykes, with cautionary warning, shoot all of you.

02:19:23.840 --> 02:19:24.840
Rock on.

02:19:24.840 --> 02:19:29.200
By the way, check the live journal community, Sakurina did like the best, dude it took Sakurina

02:19:29.200 --> 02:19:34.640
like five minutes to turn that into, just like I imagined, into a little picture with

02:19:34.640 --> 02:19:35.640
the guy doing the rock on sign.

02:19:35.640 --> 02:19:38.760
We should all get a picture of us doing the rock on symbol from that.

02:19:38.760 --> 02:19:42.360
And we could send it to him! And he'd be all, he'd be all, what the fuck is this?

02:19:42.360 --> 02:19:44.260
Cause he wouldn't, he wouldn't remember doing that, I mean.

02:19:44.260 --> 02:19:45.260
It's your fan!

02:19:45.260 --> 02:19:48.260
It's your, yeah, it's your fan club, Mr. Newsperson.

02:19:50.260 --> 02:19:51.760
Oh, shit. Alright.

02:19:54.260 --> 02:19:57.260
Alright, we're gonna get into the FUs of the week,

02:19:57.260 --> 02:20:00.660
and, uh, first in order for us to get into the FUs of the week,

02:20:00.660 --> 02:20:02.260
I have to have the music queued up,

02:20:02.260 --> 02:20:04.260
because that's an important part of having the FUs of the week.

02:20:05.260 --> 02:20:05.760
Oh, you have a new-

02:20:06.260 --> 02:20:07.260
Oh, that's right!

02:20:07.260 --> 02:20:11.140
Loki has a new song finally tonight. You're getting rid of Menomina?

02:20:11.140 --> 02:20:14.140
Yeah, I have to.

02:20:14.140 --> 02:20:19.220
That makes me kind of sad. That's right, I'll let Mel and Melody have Menomina then.

02:20:19.220 --> 02:20:22.220
Since you're not going to be using it.

02:20:22.220 --> 02:20:26.220
You were showing me your video iPod, which I'm so jealous that you have all the latest toys, but what did you do with this?

02:20:26.220 --> 02:20:31.220
So I go and get a video iPod and I'm like, oh my god, I have the new toy, I love this thing.

02:20:31.220 --> 02:20:36.220
So what's the first freaking video I put on it? Menomina.

02:20:36.220 --> 02:20:43.060
Alright, um, let's get into the FUs of the week, and Dark Sakura is usually the one that

02:20:43.060 --> 02:20:44.060
starts us off.

02:20:44.060 --> 02:20:48.060
However, I will be entering FUs on Dark Sakura's behalf tonight, so here we go in the FUs of

02:20:48.060 --> 02:20:49.060
the week.

02:20:49.060 --> 02:21:04.060
Uh, Dark Sakura, I'll be entering some FUs on Dark Sakura's behalf, um, first FU is to

02:21:04.060 --> 02:21:07.780
being sick, because I know she's been sick for like two weeks straight now, and also

02:21:07.780 --> 02:21:13.500
to bronchitis, which she has, which sucks, and the F.U. to pneumonia for scaring her,

02:21:13.500 --> 02:21:18.020
you know, thinking that she might have had pneumonia, and I think she's very angsty that

02:21:18.020 --> 02:21:21.260
she didn't get out to do a lot of stuff this weekend that she wanted to do, so I'm sure

02:21:21.260 --> 02:21:25.540
she's very pissed off about that, so an F.U. to being homebound, I guess you could call

02:21:25.540 --> 02:21:31.300
it, but an F.U. to having to go to work tomorrow. And I think that would about wrap up everything

02:21:31.300 --> 02:21:35.780
the dark soccer would be anxious, at least as far as I know, for now.

02:21:35.780 --> 02:21:42.780
Uh, let's go into, uh, Loki's FUs.

02:21:43.460 --> 02:21:49.340
Okay, um...

02:21:49.340 --> 02:21:51.220
First off,

02:21:51.220 --> 02:21:54.060
fuck you to Chevron Oil Stop

02:21:54.060 --> 02:21:56.000
for breaking my car.

02:21:56.000 --> 02:22:01.140
Um, now my car is leaking coolant out, and I'm sure it's not supposed to be doing that,

02:22:01.140 --> 02:22:05.360
Because I pour the coolant in, and it pours right out the bottom, so that's not very good.

02:22:05.360 --> 02:22:06.940
However, it doesn't empty, so...

02:22:06.940 --> 02:22:11.820
Just overheats, and I gotta take you to the dealership tomorrow, which requires me to take time off work.

02:22:11.820 --> 02:22:13.780
It's just a pain in the ass.

02:22:13.780 --> 02:22:14.680
So fuck that.

02:22:14.680 --> 02:22:19.280
And fuck you old Asian women drivers, because god damn it, you fuckin' suck.

02:22:19.280 --> 02:22:22.980
I'm sittin' in the car, watching you drive, and you suck so bad.

02:22:22.980 --> 02:22:28.300
You know, braking when there's, like, a car fifty feet in front of you, and, like, having your turn signal on,

02:22:28.300 --> 02:22:32.860
switching lanes the wrong direction it's just a pain in the ass and you just

02:22:32.860 --> 02:22:37.780
really you know are reinforcing the stereotypes so fuck old Asian women

02:22:37.780 --> 02:22:51.420
drivers and finally Rocko my turn I would like to give an F you to me being a

02:22:51.420 --> 02:22:55.460
workaholic recently and me being very lazy on the weekend and not having any

02:22:55.460 --> 02:22:59.060
time to crack the test because I'm too lazy and if you did the fact that it

02:22:59.060 --> 02:23:03.860
took me like an hour to get that set up earlier tonight to rip the ultra mix

02:23:03.860 --> 02:23:08.580
three songs directly from the Xbox and no one appreciates it because the

02:23:08.580 --> 02:23:15.580
song list is kind of whack and I just give I don't know a nephew to the fact

02:23:15.580 --> 02:23:18.020
that I have to go back to work tomorrow but at least it's a short week and

02:23:18.020 --> 02:23:21.100
Thanksgiving summer if you do Thanksgiving because it's a holiday I

02:23:21.100 --> 02:23:24.100
never really got I don't I don't get Thanksgiving but maybe it's just my

02:23:24.100 --> 02:23:29.620
family because we're special, my family. You should really call it for what it is. Black

02:23:29.620 --> 02:23:39.100
Friday Eve. Oh, or the shopping day, yeah. Crazy. Alright, let's go on to a melody. We're

02:23:39.100 --> 02:23:40.500
going to do Her Refuse first.

02:23:40.500 --> 02:23:52.020
Yay! I like my freaking theme song. Okay, seriously, at work there's this chick who

02:23:52.020 --> 02:23:55.780
knows the song and loves my video ipod as much as i do and will yell across the

02:23:55.780 --> 02:23:58.580
office to each other monomenon and the other one will reply it's great

02:23:58.580 --> 02:23:59.500
anyway

02:23:59.500 --> 02:24:01.640
f u to uh...

02:24:01.640 --> 02:24:07.140
curbs because they really hurt when you fall on them and f u to my knee

02:24:07.140 --> 02:24:09.940
for hurting when i hit the curb

02:24:09.940 --> 02:24:12.840
uh... f u to my shoes which

02:24:12.840 --> 02:24:16.020
went out sooner than they were supposed to, dude my shoes are supposed to last like three to five

02:24:16.020 --> 02:24:18.900
hundred miles they only lasted two hundred

02:24:18.900 --> 02:24:22.580
all my if you seem to be walk related at the moment that would be my life

02:24:22.580 --> 02:24:24.600
but uh...

02:24:24.600 --> 02:24:28.320
you know i feel offended i read that encounter a lot of them today coming up

02:24:28.320 --> 02:24:30.940
here and they

02:24:30.940 --> 02:24:36.620
and that i'm pretty mellow right now

02:24:36.620 --> 02:24:39.420
and pretty simple

02:24:39.420 --> 02:24:42.840
mister melby

02:24:42.840 --> 02:24:44.720
uh... gosh uh...

02:24:44.720 --> 02:24:46.820
i have my first appears to

02:24:46.820 --> 02:24:49.700
all the video games stores and best buys in my area

02:24:49.700 --> 02:24:51.860
because Guitar Hero is sold out everywhere

02:24:51.860 --> 02:24:54.420
what really sucks is that the one best buy by my crib

02:24:54.420 --> 02:24:57.140
I was asking the sales associate, you know, do you have this in stock

02:24:57.140 --> 02:25:01.340
and he goes, uh, we don't have it right now, I'm like, can you check anyone nearby? He's like, okay

02:25:01.340 --> 02:25:05.900
and there's like one that pops up over in South San Jose, it says like two on his screen

02:25:05.900 --> 02:25:10.940
he goes, uh, we're sold out ever, I'm like, what about that San Jose over there? Uh, two means we're sold out

02:25:10.940 --> 02:25:12.920
like, then why is there a two?

02:25:12.920 --> 02:25:13.740
uh...

02:25:13.740 --> 02:25:16.740
you can go there I guess, but no, trust me, it's sold out

02:25:16.740 --> 02:25:20.460
like did i get you don't like helping people are making a fail

02:25:20.460 --> 02:25:23.700
uh... whatever the hell you know i hope you're just happy with the minimum wage

02:25:23.700 --> 02:25:24.740
or something

02:25:24.740 --> 02:25:26.380
but uh...

02:25:26.380 --> 02:25:30.220
other than that uh... i guess is that you cannot have enough time to do so

02:25:30.220 --> 02:25:33.500
much stuff over the weekend and uh...

02:25:33.500 --> 02:25:38.500
yeah happy for not having enough that used to be entertaining

02:25:38.500 --> 02:25:40.900
right angel you have used to the week

02:25:40.900 --> 02:25:42.700
and actually don't

02:25:42.700 --> 02:25:43.820
have any

02:25:43.820 --> 02:25:45.300
play

02:25:45.300 --> 02:25:47.300
Nothing?

02:25:47.300 --> 02:25:49.300
Aww, no more ball pits!

02:25:49.300 --> 02:25:51.300
Can I drop?

02:25:51.300 --> 02:25:53.300
I thought it was Beepman from LML. You did generic 2DX drops.

02:25:53.300 --> 02:25:59.300
Well, I guess I could say a general SU, but then...

02:25:59.300 --> 02:26:01.300
Out with it! Out with it!

02:26:01.300 --> 02:26:03.300
Well, Beepman might look at me funny.

02:26:03.300 --> 02:26:09.300
They need more games to help people with visual impairment, I think.

02:26:09.300 --> 02:26:15.300
If it wasn't for certain World of Warcraft mods, I'd be in big trouble.

02:26:15.300 --> 02:26:21.300
At least World of Warcraft is moddable enough to be able to do something like that.

02:26:21.300 --> 02:26:26.300
I beat all the other people who don't think about that before they release a game.

02:26:26.300 --> 02:26:31.300
Fair enough. At least the computer has it down pretty good with the accessibility options and everything.

02:26:31.300 --> 02:26:36.300
Yes. This is why I'm a computer geek. I can see things.

02:26:36.300 --> 02:26:37.300
What do you think?

02:26:37.300 --> 02:26:38.300
Good to know.

02:26:38.300 --> 02:26:39.300
Yay.

02:26:39.300 --> 02:26:40.300
All right.

02:26:40.300 --> 02:26:43.660
Now, it's my understanding that Dark Soccer was actually at her computer just now, and

02:26:43.660 --> 02:26:47.180
she wanted to try and call in and get the real F.U., so I'm going to try and get her

02:26:47.180 --> 02:26:48.580
on the line here.

02:26:48.580 --> 02:26:50.460
Let's make this really quiet here.

02:26:50.460 --> 02:26:51.460
Let's see if we can get Dark Soccer's F.U.

02:26:51.460 --> 02:26:57.140
And then we'll go to the chat room F.U.s, of which I know you guys have plenty of F.U.s.

02:26:57.140 --> 02:27:03.020
It's got that demon voice again.

02:27:03.020 --> 02:27:05.020
Oh, wait, you there, Jamie?

02:27:08.020 --> 02:27:09.020
Hello?

02:27:09.020 --> 02:27:10.020
What now?

02:27:10.020 --> 02:27:12.020
There we go, yes, now we're good.

02:27:12.020 --> 02:27:13.020
Can you hear now?

02:27:13.020 --> 02:27:14.020
Alright, great, yes, I can hear you now.

02:27:14.020 --> 02:27:16.020
Are you ready to do your FUs?

02:27:19.020 --> 02:27:20.020
This is what's wrong.

02:27:21.020 --> 02:27:25.020
That's weird, I only heard, like, her for, like, five seconds there, something like, what's wrong?

02:27:25.020 --> 02:27:28.020
Uh, you're, oh, shoot, did it just hang up?

02:27:29.020 --> 02:27:31.020
It hung up! No, no!

02:27:31.020 --> 02:27:35.020
Okay, wait. She's calling us back. Let me make sure all my other crap is closed. I have nothing else going on there.

02:27:35.020 --> 02:27:39.020
Okay, let's try this again. Let me try closing iTunes, because iTunes is a real memory hog. That might be part of the problem.

02:27:39.020 --> 02:27:41.020
All right, here we go. Yes?

02:27:41.020 --> 02:27:43.020
Excuse me.

02:27:43.020 --> 02:27:45.020
There we go. Now you're there.

02:27:45.020 --> 02:27:49.020
It's because I disconnected IRC. It's a delay that IRC is causing.

02:27:49.020 --> 02:27:53.020
Interesting. Okay, are you ready to do your FUs? I have your music already.

02:27:53.020 --> 02:27:55.020
Yeah, I'm pretty ready.

02:27:55.020 --> 02:27:57.020
All right, here we go.

02:27:57.020 --> 02:28:09.940
My first SU goes toward having a pissed off and depressed husband.

02:28:09.940 --> 02:28:14.740
My second SU goes to people who are pissed off at everyone who is able to get an Xbox

02:28:14.740 --> 02:28:16.420
360 on launch date.

02:28:16.420 --> 02:28:19.380
Just because you can't get one bitch don't mean you should get to be down with everybody

02:28:19.380 --> 02:28:20.380
else.

02:28:20.380 --> 02:28:21.380
Hello?

02:28:21.380 --> 02:28:34.000
Second, the third one goes toward my pre-pneumonia and the fact that my antibiotics are just

02:28:34.000 --> 02:28:41.560
now starting to make me feel sicker and I can't really think of much of anything else.

02:28:41.560 --> 02:28:45.600
Those are the major pressing items on my mind.

02:28:45.600 --> 02:28:48.640
Alrighty, well I'm glad we could get you back on for the FUs.

02:29:19.840 --> 02:29:23.760
Sakurina says FU to Konami for not having In My Dreams in any games other than Dance

02:29:23.760 --> 02:29:24.760
Maniac's first mix.

02:29:24.760 --> 02:29:28.040
It's the best Dance Mania song ever and you guys can't even bother putting it in anything

02:29:28.040 --> 02:29:29.040
but Dance Maniacs?

02:29:29.040 --> 02:29:30.040
Fuck you!

02:29:30.040 --> 02:29:33.400
Also, FU to the stupid teacher who made me fail his class because he made an error and

02:29:33.400 --> 02:29:34.400
still won't correct it.

02:29:34.400 --> 02:29:38.240
FU to the smoker bitch at the bus stop who never stops blowing her goddamn cigarette

02:29:38.240 --> 02:29:39.240
smoke my way.

02:29:39.240 --> 02:29:42.920
And final FU, FU to the Xbox 360 for being an overrated piece of shit.

02:29:42.920 --> 02:29:45.880
Thanks Microsoft for making me a sucky demo kiosk.

02:29:45.880 --> 02:29:47.760
That was from Sakarina.

02:29:47.760 --> 02:29:50.640
Darkknight would like to say,

02:29:50.640 --> 02:29:57.240
F you to having to get up at 5 a.m. to catch a bus to get to work now and F you to being broke again.

02:29:57.240 --> 02:30:04.880
NintendoManiac64 says F you to you guys not noticing that someone was playing Mario Kart DS about an hour ago.

02:30:04.880 --> 02:30:09.200
No, I knew Loki had been playing Mario Kart DS all night, but I didn't think the mic was picking it up.

02:30:09.200 --> 02:30:12.320
F you to you guys for not sharing your MKDS friend codes.

02:30:12.320 --> 02:30:18.640
I'll give it out. Just send me a private message on Orange Lounge. I just don't want the freaky other people on the internet to be adding me and shit.

02:30:18.640 --> 02:30:21.040
Although I guess I have to have them on my list, huh?

02:30:21.040 --> 02:30:23.360
I guess I'd be safe.

02:30:23.360 --> 02:30:24.560
I'm nervous.

02:30:24.560 --> 02:30:27.840
Because there's stalker people out there and I don't want to watch out for them.

02:30:27.840 --> 02:30:33.800
F you to my DSL for crapping out three times during the show. F you to prawn adware.

02:30:33.800 --> 02:30:40.040
And when he says prawn, he means pornography, hardcore pornography.

02:30:40.040 --> 02:30:45.960
DarklionXBI says, F you to Colin Cowherd of ESPN Radio for dissing the late Eddie Guerrero.

02:30:45.960 --> 02:30:47.520
Oh, I heard about this.

02:30:47.520 --> 02:30:51.080
You might have no interest in professional wrestling, but dissing the dead is unforgivable.

02:30:51.080 --> 02:30:54.080
I hope you die and see what it's like to be dissed dead.

02:30:54.080 --> 02:30:58.680
You know what, I don't follow wrestling, so I didn't, but that's why I don't say anything

02:30:58.680 --> 02:31:01.120
about it, because I don't follow it, so I just, you know, um.

02:31:01.120 --> 02:31:04.120
Well, if it's any consolation, I'm 100% behind that FU.

02:31:04.120 --> 02:31:12.120
Yeah, I understand it's a big deal, you know. Don't fuck with wrestling fans, man. They will throw you to the mat.

02:31:12.120 --> 02:31:18.120
Dude, one of the pro wrestling sites put up the ESPN comment line and email address, and the wrestling fans crashed both.

02:31:18.120 --> 02:31:20.120
Oh, I can imagine.

02:31:20.120 --> 02:31:28.120
F.U. to some people telling me to stop correcting at things.

02:31:28.120 --> 02:31:33.120
Hey, they might be something little to you, but that's a big thing to me.

02:31:33.120 --> 02:31:39.120
SSJ100Matt says F.U. to work screwing me over this week and making me miss my first Thanksgiving away from home.

02:31:39.120 --> 02:31:45.120
F.U. to True Crimes New York City for being such a good game but glitchy and choppy as hell.

02:31:45.120 --> 02:31:52.120
PopePanda says F you to my gimpy father for preventing me from getting Indian food.

02:31:52.120 --> 02:31:56.120
Too spicy? I don't know.

02:31:56.120 --> 02:32:02.120
Illusions says F you to being sick for two weeks straight and F you to having two. Count them two papers due this week.

02:32:02.120 --> 02:32:09.120
MPQ says F you to being completely unprepared for my Japanese test tomorrow and F you to the Ultra K tarnishing the new arcade with 2DX.

02:32:09.120 --> 02:32:13.120
I think there was something else that I forget so F you to my shit memory.

02:32:13.120 --> 02:32:20.120
3. Neo14789 says, F you to the creative Xbox 360 distribution strategy. It sucks!

02:32:20.120 --> 02:32:25.600
4. XanagerC would like to say, F you to being on the east coast. It's too damn late right

02:32:25.600 --> 02:32:30.440
now. Like midnight. Sorry, that's our bad. Damn us being on the west coast.

02:32:30.440 --> 02:32:35.800
5. Misty says, F you to having a work Friday. Nuff said and I don't care that I'm off for

02:32:35.800 --> 02:32:39.240
Thanksgiving itself. And of course, fuck cage match. Well, love you too, babe.

02:32:39.240 --> 02:32:44.040
Dark Knight says, F you to my PC telling me I have to reinstall windows because one file

02:32:44.040 --> 02:32:45.840
went mysteriously missing.

02:32:45.840 --> 02:32:50.560
Legend of Zaku says, F you to MTV for being unprepared assholes who have no gaming taste,

02:32:50.560 --> 02:32:52.440
but at least they gave me two $50 games.

02:32:52.440 --> 02:32:54.440
Thanks MTV for pimping my checking account.

02:32:54.440 --> 02:33:00.040
F you to GameStop for having the gall of offering me $14 for my sealed copy of NBA Live 06 and

02:33:00.040 --> 02:33:03.120
20% less of that if I wanted cash for it.

02:33:03.120 --> 02:33:06.880
Roz would like to say F you to whatever my dad's deal was last night, F you to the basketball

02:33:06.880 --> 02:33:10.360
team for constantly bitching about the people in the school play. It's not our fault that

02:33:10.360 --> 02:33:17.200
the directors were bitches to you. F you to my sensitive skin for being sensitive.

02:33:17.200 --> 02:33:22.680
And BX JasonXV says F you to fanboys. Brilliant red sucks. It's not a good song. Go listen

02:33:22.680 --> 02:33:28.240
to B rock you. I have to agree. Brilliant red sucks. So you have at least my support

02:33:28.240 --> 02:33:29.240
in that game.

02:33:29.240 --> 02:33:34.880
Sephiroth1215 says F you to the UltraMix3 problems and to the 360 hype. Even though

02:33:34.880 --> 02:33:41.880
I'm still getting one at launch. Hey, I'm an equal opportunist gamer and F you to the random Garth Brooks concert during the MTV savings

02:33:43.560 --> 02:33:46.600
That's like that time Loki and I tried to go to Hooters and there was like a random

02:33:46.600 --> 02:33:50.800
There was a very random random audio slave concert in the middle of the street like, you know

02:33:50.900 --> 02:33:55.320
How many how many times did that does that happen to you that you have this just a random?

02:33:55.320 --> 02:33:58.560
Oh, hey, look audio slaves doing a concert in the middle of the street in New York

02:33:58.560 --> 02:34:01.720
They had you two show up and do a concert on a flatbed truck

02:34:01.720 --> 02:34:06.720
That's how they did their all because of you video and you see a bunch of people like taking pictures with their cell phones

02:34:06.720 --> 02:34:08.840
And stuff so I'm like what the hell is you do?

02:34:09.480 --> 02:34:11.360
All right, um

I have to take time to think.

02:34:30.600 --> 02:34:35.280
Well gosh man, Ultramix 3, well let's just hope Ultramix 4

02:34:35.280 --> 02:34:39.160

As we demonstrate, straight

02:39:46.800 --> 02:39:48.600
Everybody wants a piece of the pie

This is the way we dance

02:39:55.400 --> 02:39:56.600
This is the way we rock

02:39:56.600 --> 02:39:58.000
This is the way we ride

02:39:58.000 --> 02:39:59.400
As we demonstrate

02:39:59.400 --> 02:40:01.400
As we demonstrate

02:40:18.200 --> 02:40:20.200
This just sounds

02:40:20.840 --> 02:40:22.840
This just sounds

02:40:22.840 --> 02:40:24.440
Everybody wants a piece of the pie

02:40:24.440 --> 02:40:26.040

02:40:44.780 --> 02:40:58.400
This is the way we ride, this is the way we dance.

02:40:58.400 --> 02:41:04.040
OrangeLoungeRadio.com

02:41:04.040 --> 02:41:07.360
Alright kids, we're back here on Orange Lounge Radio, and as promised we will be opening up the

02:41:07.360 --> 02:41:10.600
skype line soon, but we have a couple things we need to get to first.

02:41:10.600 --> 02:41:14.800
One of them being the one and only Xtaphur is here, and

02:41:14.800 --> 02:41:18.680
Xtaphur, you do your own show on the station, believe it or not, I don't know

02:41:18.680 --> 02:41:20.640
why we gave you a show, but you do have one.

02:41:20.640 --> 02:41:23.920
And when is it? It's on Mondays,

02:41:23.920 --> 02:41:30.400
on Mondays at 7 o'clock to 9. Pretty random show. We don't talk about video

02:41:30.400 --> 02:41:37.400
games all too much, but I pretty much open the show to talk about anything.

02:41:37.400 --> 02:41:41.320
Mostly cock-ass and fucking. So it's like The View, but with a bunch of

02:41:41.320 --> 02:41:42.880
perverts. Oh yeah.

02:41:42.880 --> 02:41:47.480
And I try to have guests on the show. Last week, by the way, I gave everybody an

02:41:47.480 --> 02:41:51.300
assignment that nobody has emailed me. What is the assignment?

02:41:51.300 --> 02:41:56.140
The assignment was to watch a sad movie and email me your thoughts on it.

02:41:56.140 --> 02:42:00.620
I told the whole chat room to do it and they have not done it.

02:42:00.620 --> 02:42:01.620
Hurry up!

02:42:01.620 --> 02:42:06.140
I'm going to beat all of your asses tomorrow on my show if you guys don't do that.

02:42:06.140 --> 02:42:09.440
Alright, public spanking for public.

02:42:09.440 --> 02:42:11.820
Tuesday nights on this very station.

02:42:11.820 --> 02:42:13.340
She's only every other week for right now.

02:42:13.340 --> 02:42:17.540
I'm not sure if she's on or off this week because of her being sick.

02:42:17.540 --> 02:42:20.220
I think it's an on week but because she's sick she might be off.

02:42:20.220 --> 02:42:25.020
I don't know, but check out, pump up the volume with the Wonderly Dark Soccer, and of course,

02:42:25.020 --> 02:42:28.780
that's seven o'clock Pacific time, and of course, if you want to always be in the know

02:42:28.780 --> 02:42:34.460
on when we're live and stuff, the best place to be is our LiveJournal community, www.livejournal.com

02:42:34.460 --> 02:42:38.580
slash users slash orange lounge, okay?

02:42:38.580 --> 02:42:42.460
And of course, Wednesday nights is my show, the Rob Roberts show, and yes, even though

02:42:42.460 --> 02:42:45.100
it's Thanksgiving, I'll be doing a show this week.

02:42:45.100 --> 02:42:47.740
It'll be up after Thanksgiving, it's not until Thursday, but I'll still be.

02:42:47.740 --> 02:42:49.580
I'm not going anywhere, so.

02:43:19.580 --> 02:43:25.020
I just have to say that I had to work on Friday, so I didn't get to see it until Friday after

02:43:25.020 --> 02:43:28.300
work after five o'clock.

02:43:28.300 --> 02:43:33.000
We had tried to go to an earlier showing, but all of the showings were sold out, so

02:43:33.000 --> 02:43:37.420
we had to go see the last showing, which was at 11.05.

02:43:37.420 --> 02:43:39.820
Didn't the movie make like $11 billion this weekend?

02:43:39.820 --> 02:43:45.580
You know, it's interesting because their expectations for this film were that it was going to make

02:43:45.580 --> 02:43:51.460
less than the opening of The Prisoner of Azkaban made last year because each Harry Potter film

02:43:51.460 --> 02:43:57.720
has made less than the one before it. However, this was the biggest opening ever for a Harry

02:43:57.720 --> 02:44:03.380
Potter film, also the fourth biggest opening ever in film history for national...

02:44:03.380 --> 02:44:04.380
Pottermania!

02:44:04.380 --> 02:44:06.780
Yeah, and you know, it's worth pointing out...

02:44:06.780 --> 02:44:09.420
Yes, they heard about the Harry Potter in the bathtub scene.

02:44:09.420 --> 02:44:17.420
It's worth pointing out also that of the four movies that are the best openings ever,

02:44:17.420 --> 02:44:22.420
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire is the only one that is a winner movie.

02:44:22.420 --> 02:44:29.420
All the other ones are summer films, like Spiderman, and then there was a couple other ones.

02:44:29.420 --> 02:44:31.420
It's the review.

02:44:31.420 --> 02:44:34.420
Anyways, I'm not a Star Wars fan.

02:44:34.420 --> 02:44:44.180
I saw the movie and it is really good, I enjoyed it.

02:44:44.180 --> 02:44:51.460
It fucking annoyed me at the beginning and it was weird because the third one didn't

02:44:51.460 --> 02:44:54.700
annoy me at all for what they left out in the book.

02:44:54.700 --> 02:44:58.220
I loved the film, it was great the whole way through.

02:44:58.220 --> 02:44:59.860
I saw it seven times.

02:44:59.860 --> 02:45:06.340
I saw it in London, you know, it was something that was kind of like a magical experience

02:45:06.340 --> 02:45:12.660
for Christopher, but this one kind of bugged me, I kept on comparing it to the book and

02:45:12.660 --> 02:45:18.680
I don't know, I think it's because they left out so much and I was wanting to see so much

02:45:18.680 --> 02:45:24.040
that I was just, I got so disappointed, but I will say that the second half of the film

02:45:24.040 --> 02:45:27.680
is better than the first and if you're going to watch a movie, it's all about the second

02:45:27.680 --> 02:45:32.900
half film baby it's like so good it gets really good near the end and they do a

02:45:32.900 --> 02:45:37.660
lot of good stuff and it is dark and it did earn its pg-13 rating and whether it

02:45:37.660 --> 02:45:46.020
was for the gratuitous sexual innuendos or the you know dark themes throughout

02:45:46.020 --> 02:45:51.260
the film I don't know if what it was you know why it was rated pg-13 but it was

02:45:51.260 --> 02:45:55.820
rated pg-13 for a reason and it was it was really good I would recommend it

02:45:55.820 --> 02:45:58.880
It's just that they rush through the first half of the film so much that you're like

02:45:59.180 --> 02:46:02.900
Kind of feeling like you're a DD like you can't focus on one particular scene

02:46:02.900 --> 02:46:07.640
You know because they take so much they it's like they wanted to put as much as they could from the book

02:46:07.640 --> 02:46:13.300
But they just couldn't because of time constraints. All right, you know, but it was good. I enjoyed it

02:46:13.300 --> 02:46:19.060
I'm doing it mucho recommend it. All right, so thumbs up thumbs up

02:46:19.060 --> 02:46:21.940
I didn't like I didn't love it, but I liked it a lot

02:46:21.940 --> 02:46:27.940
And I can't wait for the next one, because that was my favorite book.

02:46:27.940 --> 02:46:29.940
Alright, let's see what happens.

02:46:29.940 --> 02:46:39.940
Alright, moving on now, what we're going to do is we are going to go ahead and give DarkSakura another call,

02:46:39.940 --> 02:46:44.940
because she's not able to be here in person tonight, but she does want to talk to us all through the Skype line

02:46:44.940 --> 02:46:47.940
and let us know how she's enjoying the show.

02:46:47.940 --> 02:46:50.940
And then we'll open the Skyplane to the rest of you, because I promised we would.

02:46:50.940 --> 02:46:54.940
And we might have time to squeeze like one more call in before the show's over.

02:47:03.940 --> 02:47:04.940
Hello?

02:47:04.940 --> 02:47:05.940
Hello!

02:47:07.940 --> 02:47:08.940
Jamie?

02:47:10.940 --> 02:47:11.940
Well, it didn't have the...

02:47:11.940 --> 02:47:12.940
She didn't hang up on you?

02:47:12.940 --> 02:47:13.940
No, she didn't hang up.

02:47:13.940 --> 02:47:15.940
Oh, there we are. Hello?

02:47:15.940 --> 02:47:19.940
Can you hear me?

02:47:19.940 --> 02:47:23.940
It's been off since...

02:47:23.940 --> 02:47:27.940
Call us right back.

02:47:27.940 --> 02:47:31.940
I hope she got that part.

02:47:31.940 --> 02:47:35.940
It's like she's not Dark Sakura, she's Dark Sock.

02:47:35.940 --> 02:47:39.940
Hello?

02:47:39.940 --> 02:47:43.940
Coffee cough. Well at least we know we can hear her this time.

02:47:43.940 --> 02:47:49.140
Are you enjoying the show?

02:47:49.140 --> 02:47:54.540
Sort of. Yeah. Well, what's better when I'm there because it's, you know.

02:47:54.540 --> 02:47:59.580
I know. Mel and Melody say hello, of course, and, you know, hope you feel better and stuff.

02:47:59.580 --> 02:48:02.940
Well, I'm not running a fever anymore.

02:48:02.940 --> 02:48:07.100
That's good. They brought you a present. Oh.

02:48:07.100 --> 02:48:09.980
I can't say what it is because it's something I got someone else for their

02:48:09.980 --> 02:48:11.380
birthday who might be listening.

02:48:11.380 --> 02:48:13.820
So it's something.

02:48:13.820 --> 02:48:15.820
I'll send you a private message.

02:48:15.820 --> 02:48:16.580
OK.

02:48:16.580 --> 02:48:18.380
OK.

02:48:18.380 --> 02:48:20.700
You've got 10 minutes left on the show.

02:48:20.700 --> 02:48:21.380
I know.

02:48:21.380 --> 02:48:23.700
Aw, sweetie, feel better.

02:48:23.700 --> 02:48:26.460
Well, is there anything else you want to say to the listeners?

02:48:26.460 --> 02:48:29.620
Give them a final thought of some sorts?

02:48:29.620 --> 02:48:32.900
Um, I like burritos.

02:48:32.900 --> 02:48:34.540
I ate one today.

02:48:34.540 --> 02:48:36.340
Congratulations.

02:48:36.340 --> 02:48:38.060
I don't like lung cookies.

02:48:38.060 --> 02:48:39.420
Don't burritos make me?

02:48:39.420 --> 02:48:40.660
I feel like my cat.

02:48:40.660 --> 02:48:43.100
Don't burritos make you fart, though?

02:48:43.100 --> 02:48:47.860
No, they make me throw up, though. That's the problem I have with burritos. They make me fart like a whole bunch.

02:48:47.860 --> 02:48:52.380
That is new information. Thank you for that. I know what my cat feels like, though.

02:48:52.380 --> 02:48:53.220
I would...

02:48:53.220 --> 02:48:53.980
Oh, go ahead.

02:48:53.980 --> 02:48:58.540
Horkin' up lung cookies is like horkin' up a hairball.

02:48:58.540 --> 02:49:04.340
Oh, God. Oh, I can't even think. Oh, that's horrible. I'm sorry. And I've been getting sympathetic looks from the cat, like, all weekend.

02:49:04.340 --> 02:49:06.980
The cat knows what you're going through.

02:49:06.980 --> 02:49:10.100
Oh, yes. I feel her pain now.

02:49:10.100 --> 02:49:13.500
How was the podcast awards? We didn't get a chance to talk to you a whole lot on

02:49:13.500 --> 02:49:16.900
on the air about that. We can get into more detail next week. But that's why you were

02:49:16.900 --> 02:49:18.620
out last week. How was the podcast awards?

02:49:18.620 --> 02:49:22.640
I saw Adam Curry's hair. He stood a foot away from me.

02:49:22.640 --> 02:49:25.740
That's hot. They didn't let you get on stage the same week?

02:49:25.740 --> 02:49:29.940
He's still hot. And he's like put on muscle.

02:49:29.940 --> 02:49:33.740
Or something. He looks like really good shape. Maybe he's been working out.

02:49:33.740 --> 02:49:38.140
Maybe. But I think now that he's a little older he actually

02:49:38.140 --> 02:49:43.100
looks more handsome than he did back in his, you know, glam look in 80's days.

02:49:43.100 --> 02:49:46.500
Hmm. Did you get to get up on stage?

02:49:46.500 --> 02:49:52.300
No, they didn't let us say anything, so Julie and I just leeched off the buffet.

02:49:52.300 --> 02:49:56.540
Oh, hey, awesome food! It was actually really good food, but

02:49:56.540 --> 02:50:00.300
the thing is that they didn't want to let us in because we didn't have badges. We were like, hey, we won a prize!

02:50:00.300 --> 02:50:04.940
Like, okay, you can come in. Was Adam Curry wearing leather?

02:50:04.940 --> 02:50:11.980
No, he was wearing like a tux, except he didn't have the jacket or the tie and it was sort

02:50:11.980 --> 02:50:13.180
of unbuttoned at the top.

02:50:13.180 --> 02:50:16.500
It was that very casual dressy look.

02:50:16.500 --> 02:50:18.060
What a lazy, lazy bat.

02:50:18.060 --> 02:50:20.060
No, I'm kidding.

02:50:20.060 --> 02:50:29.500
There were people who were dressed in nice clothes, and then people who were sort of

02:50:29.500 --> 02:50:32.860
not so nice like people who were

02:50:32.860 --> 02:50:37.220
wearing like what you wear to like go work out in or something

02:50:37.220 --> 02:50:41.060
now you know if I had gone I would have dressed fabulously if I'd went

02:50:41.060 --> 02:50:44.140
I dressed fabulously so I forgot to put on my boots

02:50:44.140 --> 02:50:47.620
Did you wear your angel wings? No I didn't

02:50:47.620 --> 02:50:52.020
You forgot to put on your boots? You know those really hot black pants I have?

02:50:52.020 --> 02:50:55.820
I'm sorry what? You know those really hot black pants I have? Yes

02:50:55.820 --> 02:51:00.820
I wore those and I wore that shirt that I actually I wore what I wore to the club

02:51:00.820 --> 02:51:03.820
last Friday, the Friday before.

02:51:03.820 --> 02:51:04.820
Awesome.

02:51:04.820 --> 02:51:08.820
Except I didn't have my big red shiny shoes because I actually brought my black boots

02:51:08.820 --> 02:51:11.820
instead but I left them in the trunk so I wore my Doc Martens.

02:51:11.820 --> 02:51:12.820
Okay, okay.

02:51:12.820 --> 02:51:13.820
They were brown.

02:51:13.820 --> 02:51:14.820
I was like hell of a lot of this black.

02:51:14.820 --> 02:51:15.820
Oh look, brown shoes.

02:51:15.820 --> 02:51:17.820
So did you meet any other cool people?

02:51:17.820 --> 02:51:18.820
Are you there?

02:51:18.820 --> 02:51:20.820
Yeah, I did.

02:51:20.820 --> 02:51:30.820
I did. I met a guy named Frank from the Overnightscape, a really cool independent talk show podcast.

02:51:30.820 --> 02:51:32.820
Cool.

02:51:32.820 --> 02:51:44.820
I met a few other people from the general New Jersey area. Pretty cool folks. We hung out there for a while. I actually got interviewed for his podcast as one of the winners.

02:51:44.820 --> 02:51:48.820
I wonder if that's aired yet. We'll have to check that out.

02:51:48.820 --> 02:51:50.820
Probably, he does his nightly.

02:51:50.820 --> 02:51:52.820
Oh my god, that's a lot.

02:51:52.820 --> 02:51:54.820
Yeah, that's a bit much.

02:51:54.820 --> 02:51:58.820
I know. Could you imagine if we tried to do OLR nightly? Oh my god, we'd die.

02:51:58.820 --> 02:51:59.820
We'd have no life.

02:51:59.820 --> 02:52:01.820
Yeah, we don't as it is.

02:52:01.820 --> 02:52:03.820
Well, we're going to wrap up the show pretty soon.

02:52:03.820 --> 02:52:07.820
I promised a couple other people they could get in on Skype, so we're going to call it a show.

02:52:07.820 --> 02:52:08.820
Well, forget that. I'm special.

02:52:08.820 --> 02:52:10.820
I know, I know, but...

02:52:10.820 --> 02:52:15.820
Okay, I suppose I can deign to release some time to NASA.

02:52:15.820 --> 02:52:21.820
Alright, well feel better, okay? Chat room sends much love, but I know you've been lurking in chat, so you can kind of see that, so.

02:52:21.820 --> 02:52:23.820
Yeah, well, as soon as I reconnect.

02:52:23.820 --> 02:52:25.820
Alright. Kisses, and hearts, and stuff.

02:52:25.820 --> 02:52:26.820
Bye.

02:52:26.820 --> 02:52:27.820
Bye.

02:52:27.820 --> 02:52:28.820
Bye.

02:52:28.820 --> 02:52:36.820
Alright. We're going to open up the Sky- we're going to open up the Skype line now, but it's the lightning round, kids. This is the lightning round.

02:52:36.820 --> 02:52:43.820
Put in some thunder here. It's the lightning round of our Skype line being open, because you only get two minutes.

02:52:43.820 --> 02:52:45.820
We're almost out of time.

02:52:45.820 --> 02:52:47.820
That's not thunder, is it?

02:52:47.820 --> 02:52:49.820
Wooooo!

02:52:49.820 --> 02:52:51.820
Alright, here we go.

02:52:51.820 --> 02:52:53.820
That is the worst thunder ever.

02:52:53.820 --> 02:52:46.580
Hi, you're on Orange

02:52:53.820 --> 02:52:55.820
Orange Radio. Hello.

02:52:55.820 --> 02:52:57.820
Obviously I need no introduction.

02:52:57.820 --> 02:52:59.820
You already know who this is.

02:52:59.820 --> 02:53:01.820
Alright, basically

02:53:01.820 --> 02:53:03.820
when I was in the MTV thing

02:53:03.820 --> 02:53:05.820
they are going to be

02:53:05.820 --> 02:53:07.820
the DDR player they're going to be doing it on

02:53:07.820 --> 02:53:09.820
is this cat named Sketch.

02:53:09.820 --> 02:53:11.820
He's one of the best players in the universe.

02:53:11.820 --> 02:53:17.820
No! I mean it in a noun way. Look, there's got this DDR player named Sketch.

02:53:17.820 --> 02:53:20.320
Okay, I'll stop taking away from you in a minute. Go ahead.

02:53:20.320 --> 02:53:24.820
He is... he's a freestyler's... hmm?

02:53:24.820 --> 02:53:28.820
No, go ahead. S versus being a smartass. Keep talking.

02:53:28.820 --> 02:53:30.820
Uh...

02:53:30.820 --> 02:53:32.820
Great. You broke his train.

02:53:32.820 --> 02:53:38.820
As I said, besides that, all they're really gonna focus on is him.

02:53:38.820 --> 02:53:44.260
the only DER player that they shine their cameras on. They just basically asked him

02:53:44.260 --> 02:53:51.260
a few questions about, you know, about how, you know, you know, about how, of his playing

02:53:51.260 --> 02:53:57.580
skills, and apparently they even went as far as making a breakdance on a carpeted floor

02:53:57.580 --> 02:54:04.580
on the stage. Okay. So, pretty much, he will be in an NTV Overdrive special, I think, on

02:54:04.580 --> 02:54:09.580
He will be in an NTV Overdrive special I think on Tuesday.

02:54:09.580 --> 02:54:14.580
But the segment will probably air this Tuesday in that episode of Direct Effect.

02:54:14.580 --> 02:54:19.580
So you'll definitely get a glimpse of him.

02:54:19.580 --> 02:54:21.580
Zaku, am I going to see you on the TiVo?

02:54:21.580 --> 02:54:26.580
So you're probably going to be TiVo, I assume.

02:54:26.580 --> 02:54:29.580
Yeah, I'm gonna do it.

02:54:29.580 --> 02:54:34.580
And basically critique it like you always do with other things.

02:54:34.580 --> 02:54:36.580
We'll see. Are you gonna be on it?

02:54:36.580 --> 02:54:48.580
Another thing. One of the hosts from Direct Effect actually had the gall to walk out of the stage when she refused to do a segment again.

02:54:48.580 --> 02:54:52.580
Yeah, she refused to retake a segment.

02:54:52.580 --> 02:54:54.540
fucking lala basquiz

02:54:54.540 --> 02:54:59.280
the host of direct effect was pretty damn clueless about the arts begin with

02:54:59.280 --> 02:55:03.200
so she was a good what the hell do you know is that that game will be times up

02:55:03.200 --> 02:55:04.080

Oh my God, are you having to work Tuesday?

02:55:36.120 --> 02:55:37.120

Yes, yes.

02:55:42.960 --> 02:55:49.400
You'd have to come in at like 3 a.m. to beat people up on the line and stuff or something,

02:55:49.400 --> 02:55:50.520
I don't know.

02:55:50.520 --> 02:55:52.140
Yeah, pretty much.

02:55:52.140 --> 02:55:54.400
Anything else you want to share?

02:55:54.400 --> 02:55:55.580
No, no, no.

02:55:55.580 --> 02:55:58.920
You have a minute ten left before I hang up on you?

02:55:58.920 --> 02:56:02.540

What is?

02:56:21.860 --> 02:56:23.860
Mario Kart DS.

02:56:23.860 --> 02:56:26.860
Okay. Oh, yeah, Mario Kart DS is badass. I love it.

02:56:26.860 --> 02:56:27.860

Alright.

02:56:33.860 --> 02:56:35.860

02:56:39.860 --> 02:56:40.860
Okay, cool.

02:56:40.860 --> 02:56:43.860
I'm afraid of the stalkers more than he is.

02:56:43.860 --> 02:56:44.860
Okay.

02:56:44.860 --> 02:56:46.860
Alright, a minute twenty, what else is on your mind?

02:56:46.860 --> 02:56:51.860
Uh, I score as a DDR club now, which is like, pretty cool. Yeah.

02:56:51.860 --> 02:56:53.860
Cool? Where's that at?

02:56:53.860 --> 02:56:55.860
Uh, at my school.

02:56:55.860 --> 02:56:58.860
Alright. Well, is this like high school, college, or what?

02:56:58.860 --> 02:56:59.860
Yeah, high school.

02:56:59.860 --> 02:57:00.860
Alright, awesome.

02:57:00.860 --> 02:57:01.860
We put her in FIO.

02:57:01.860 --> 02:57:02.860
Okay.

02:57:02.860 --> 02:57:08.860
Yeah, and, not even so, I've only done two rounds of DDR, instead of three. Yeah.

02:57:08.860 --> 02:57:13.860
Are you guys, are you guys gonna be, uh, bringing Ultramix 3 into your club?

really have no clothes.

02:57:17.740 --> 02:57:19.920
I thought I'd ask.

02:57:19.920 --> 02:57:21.620
Alright.

02:57:21.620 --> 02:57:23.100
Forty-five seconds.

02:57:23.100 --> 02:57:29.420
So I'm still, I'm not the worst person, actually there's other person that's like, I don't think I've ever worked with a person before.

02:57:29.420 --> 02:57:33.140
Well maybe they're just joining the DDR club because they want to get fit.

02:57:33.140 --> 02:57:36.020
Maybe. Who knows.

02:57:36.020 --> 02:57:40.580
Well, what other events do you guys have planned in the DDR club?

02:57:40.580 --> 02:57:42.900
uh...

02:57:42.900 --> 02:57:45.980

02:57:45.980 --> 02:57:47.920

02:57:58.380 --> 02:58:00.580

two tv's so we didn't have two going on

02:58:03.860 --> 02:58:05.100

three, two, one

02:58:06.340 --> 02:58:07.820

02:58:07.820 --> 02:58:09.180

I think I forgot first guy.

02:58:21.500 --> 02:58:25.500
You know what? The lightning round, I know, I cut Zaku off so bad, I'm so sorry,

02:58:25.500 --> 02:58:29.500
but I think we need to institute the lightning round every time we do Skype. That's fun.

02:58:29.500 --> 02:58:30.500
It is fun.

02:58:30.500 --> 02:58:35.500
See what I love doing? Do you see how I coaxed him to talk for 30 more seconds just so I could hang up on him?

02:58:37.500 --> 02:58:40.500
Yeah, I feel bad, but it's still funny, so you should still do it.
