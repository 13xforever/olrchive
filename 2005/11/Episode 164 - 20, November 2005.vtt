[SPEAKER_36]: Thank you for watching!

05:58.089 --> 05:58.329
[SPEAKER_32]: Weird.

05:58.849 --> 05:59.450
[SPEAKER_32]: And I don't snore.

05:59.630 --> 06:00.250
[SPEAKER_32]: Alright.

06:00.991 --> 06:01.351
[SPEAKER_32]: Alright.

06:02.472 --> 06:13.138
[SPEAKER_32]: Anyway, kids, what we're going to do, since it is a very special day here in the Bomani world, we're going to start off tonight by taking a real quick break to bring you a song.

06:14.219 --> 06:17.360
[SPEAKER_32]: And we'll come back and we're going to get into some music from Ultimix 3 as well.

06:17.380 --> 06:21.863
[SPEAKER_32]: But of course, because it is 20 November, you know we have to start off tonight with this song.

06:21.903 --> 06:24.885
[SPEAKER_32]: So here it is, 20 November, and we'll be back right after this.

07:29.525 --> 07:31.609
Thank you for watching!

07:44.232 --> 07:46.113
[SPEAKER_32]: All right, we're back here on Orange Lounge Radio.

07:46.153 --> 07:47.493
[SPEAKER_32]: We're going to get into some music, though.

07:47.653 --> 07:50.254
[SPEAKER_32]: Now, see, that was just a special thing because it is 20 November.

07:50.294 --> 07:50.734
[SPEAKER_32]: We have to.

07:50.954 --> 07:53.875
[SPEAKER_32]: And we will give a happy belated 19 November later in the show.

07:53.935 --> 07:56.856
[SPEAKER_32]: But since it is kind of the Bomani holiday, I have no idea why.

07:57.236 --> 07:57.916
[SPEAKER_32]: Well, I do know why.

07:58.376 --> 08:01.597
[SPEAKER_32]: It's this big stupid thing that everybody, you know, recognizes in this scene.

08:01.637 --> 08:02.117
[SPEAKER_32]: So whatever.

08:02.557 --> 08:02.958
[SPEAKER_32]: There you go.

08:03.978 --> 08:06.759
[SPEAKER_32]: Okay, so we're going to get into some music, though, from Ultramix 3.

08:06.979 --> 08:07.639
[SPEAKER_32]: And I'll tell you what.

08:07.699 --> 08:10.720
[SPEAKER_32]: First thing I'm going to say about Ultramix 3, before we even really get into the show,

08:11.441 --> 08:14.230
[SPEAKER_32]: it's got a very interesting song list a very

08:16.408 --> 08:18.289
[SPEAKER_32]: Special song list, if you will.

08:18.689 --> 08:20.190
[SPEAKER_32]: It's definitely diverse.

08:20.310 --> 08:21.010
[SPEAKER_32]: We'll give it that.

08:21.470 --> 08:26.252
[SPEAKER_31]: So we're going to be playing... Special, like, special school bus, wearing the helmet special.

08:26.392 --> 08:27.192
[SPEAKER_32]: It's all kinds of special.

08:27.472 --> 08:32.094
[SPEAKER_32]: So we will be playing music from Ultimix 3 throughout tonight's show for you guys, and you be the judge.

08:32.114 --> 08:35.336
[SPEAKER_32]: We're going to play the good stuff and the bad stuff and the downright ugly stuff.

08:35.356 --> 08:36.396
[SPEAKER_32]: We're going to play it all tonight.

08:37.076 --> 08:40.358
[SPEAKER_32]: And the stuff that you guys like, we'll keep in rotation on our Bomani Music More.

08:40.378 --> 08:43.219
[SPEAKER_32]: But the stuff that's just like, what the fuck, we will...

08:44.105 --> 08:45.665
[SPEAKER_32]: Get Rid Of, and Never Play Again.

08:46.366 --> 08:53.328
[SPEAKER_32]: Alright, so, in this break we're going to start off, we're going to play, in this break, a track by Orifiz with Basile.

08:53.368 --> 08:56.509
[SPEAKER_32]: They were in the last Ultramix game, so this should be interesting.

08:56.929 --> 08:58.949
[SPEAKER_32]: We're going to play a song called Come With Me.

08:58.989 --> 09:00.990
[SPEAKER_32]: It's not the same one from the V-Rare, though.

09:01.050 --> 09:05.211
[SPEAKER_32]: It's by Yahil and Tammy, so it's the other Come With Me we're going to play in this break.

09:05.631 --> 09:08.052
[SPEAKER_32]: And then we're going to play Black Eyed Peas.

09:08.092 --> 09:10.573
[SPEAKER_32]: Black Eyed Peas have a brand new song in this Ultramix.

09:11.073 --> 09:11.693
[SPEAKER_32]: Shall we dance?

09:11.733 --> 09:12.754
[SPEAKER_32]: I can make of nothing I'd like better

[SPEAKER_32]: Mel, how you doing?

14:57.762 --> 14:58.322
[SPEAKER_38]: Doing great.

[SPEAKER_38]: It's 20 November, and hey, what's a party without Melvis in the house?

[SPEAKER_32]: Oh, that's right.

15:02.346 --> 15:04.208
[SPEAKER_32]: Now, how have things been with you?

15:05.248 --> 15:06.790
[SPEAKER_38]: Things have been pretty super.

15:06.830 --> 15:09.152

[SPEAKER_38]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

16:01.793 --> 16:03.594
[SPEAKER_32]: I've heard intimations about it.

16:03.854 --> 16:05.154
[SPEAKER_32]: I can't say much about it.

16:05.174 --> 16:05.855
[SPEAKER_32]: I don't know how much.

16:05.935 --> 16:08.716
[SPEAKER_32]: I might have said too much, but it's out there publicly.

16:08.776 --> 16:11.197
[SPEAKER_32]: Anybody can find it, so it's there.

16:11.217 --> 16:12.117
[SPEAKER_32]: It's going to launch soon.

16:12.697 --> 16:13.898
[SPEAKER_38]: Yeah, I've heard.

16:14.498 --> 16:19.640
[SPEAKER_38]: I've talked to people within the company about it, but I think that anyone else couldn't speculate on it.

16:19.660 --> 16:20.541
[SPEAKER_38]: It's got to be on the download.

16:20.581 --> 16:20.801
[SPEAKER_38]: I know.

16:20.921 --> 16:21.761
[SPEAKER_38]: I feel you.

16:21.821 --> 16:25.223
[SPEAKER_38]: I got noses out there in every direction finding this stuff out.

16:25.463 --> 16:25.843
[SPEAKER_38]: It's all good.

16:26.043 --> 16:31.225
[SPEAKER_38]: Yeah, the cool thing, actually, just back on T-shirt real quick, this is actually the first prize I ever won in a DDR tournament.

16:32.148 --> 16:34.169
[SPEAKER_38]: This is the end of Freestyle back in SoCal.

16:34.189 --> 16:36.390
[SPEAKER_38]: I think it was 2000, Santa Monica Pier Tourney.

16:36.770 --> 16:38.931
[SPEAKER_38]: And there were only like three t-shirts given out.

16:38.951 --> 16:42.253
[SPEAKER_38]: And I think overall, of people I know in the community, there are only like five.

16:43.193 --> 16:43.674
[SPEAKER_32]: Wow.

16:44.274 --> 16:46.755
[SPEAKER_38]: Yeah, I'm one of the special Fab Five.

16:47.195 --> 16:52.098
[SPEAKER_32]: Now, I have to ask you really quickly before we get into the other stuff in the show.

16:52.538 --> 16:54.639
[SPEAKER_32]: Did you listen to this week's podcast that we do?

16:54.959 --> 16:56.700
[SPEAKER_32]: Yes, as a matter of fact, I did.

16:56.820 --> 16:57.881
[SPEAKER_32]: What did you think about...

16:58.581 --> 16:59.001
[SPEAKER_32]: www.darksakura.com

17:17.113 --> 17:20.295
[SPEAKER_32]: Badum, you got your own internet movie database page.

17:20.555 --> 17:21.676
[SPEAKER_38]: I had no idea.

17:21.856 --> 17:29.140
[SPEAKER_38]: I mean, people talk about being, you know, some sort of internet celebrity or whatever, but being on IMDb, that's a whole different sort of freaky.

17:30.120 --> 17:32.262
[SPEAKER_38]: And they still can't even spell my last name right.

17:32.342 --> 17:33.923
[SPEAKER_32]: Is your last name spelled wrong on there?

17:34.183 --> 17:36.144
[SPEAKER_38]: Yes, I do not have an H in my last name.

17:36.224 --> 17:38.985
[SPEAKER_38]: I don't know why people assume there is, but eh.

17:39.746 --> 17:39.866
[SPEAKER_32]: Oh.

17:40.182 --> 17:40.743
[SPEAKER_38]: Shark's Girl Melody

17:58.447 --> 18:01.628
[SPEAKER_32]: Now, tell us about this fundraiser you're a part of.

18:01.968 --> 18:07.571
[SPEAKER_32]: I know this is a big part of your life lately, and I'm just curious.

18:09.371 --> 18:25.898
[SPEAKER_27]: Yeah, I decided in May, actually, that I was going to look into joining the team in training through the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society to walk a marathon, and at that point in time, I was literally waiting for E3, the day of the meeting, and things weren't working out time-wise, so I thought, okay, I'll join the fall season.

18:26.431 --> 18:33.141
[SPEAKER_27]: So I went back in July and started training on July 31st, and I've been training for a marathon.

18:33.161 --> 18:37.948
[SPEAKER_27]: I'm going to be walking 26.2 miles, hopefully, on December 11th in Honolulu.

18:38.830 --> 18:45.376
[SPEAKER_27]: and I'm up to, I've raised $3,675 so far for leukemia and lymphoma research.

18:45.636 --> 18:46.857
[SPEAKER_32]: Wow, that's amazing.

18:46.937 --> 18:51.061
[SPEAKER_32]: Now, if folks want to donate more, because you can go above and beyond, right?

18:51.081 --> 18:52.602
[SPEAKER_32]: Do we have a link we can give or something?

18:52.662 --> 18:57.066
[SPEAKER_27]: I'm actually over my total, but I'm taking everything anyone's willing to give me, even if it's just a dollar or two.

18:57.547 --> 19:03.071
[SPEAKER_27]: The best thing to do is go to livejournal.com slash user slash melathon, M-E-L-A-T-O-N.

19:03.812 --> 19:04.352
[SPEAKER_27]: How do you spell it?

19:04.372 --> 19:05.493
[SPEAKER_27]: It's like marathon only with Mel.

19:05.653 --> 19:06.353
[SPEAKER_32]: Melathon.

19:06.413 --> 19:07.734
[SPEAKER_27]: I can't even think of how to spell it myself.

19:07.754 --> 19:08.674
[SPEAKER_27]: That's kind of sad.

19:08.854 --> 19:09.194
[SPEAKER_32]: How about this?

19:09.314 --> 19:10.635
[SPEAKER_32]: M-E-L-A-T-H-O-N.

19:10.795 --> 19:11.135
[SPEAKER_32]: Thank you.

19:11.215 --> 19:11.575
[SPEAKER_32]: You're welcome.

19:11.935 --> 19:15.056
[SPEAKER_27]: So, yeah, that's pretty much been my life lately.

19:15.076 --> 19:18.478
[SPEAKER_27]: I was supposed to walk 22 miles yesterday.

19:18.598 --> 19:23.059
[SPEAKER_27]: I did 12 because on Tuesday I fell and ran my knee into a curb.

19:23.079 --> 19:26.641
[SPEAKER_27]: And it's very lovely and pretty multicolors.

19:27.141 --> 19:27.441
[SPEAKER_27]: Ouch.

19:28.320 --> 19:32.764
[SPEAKER_27]: Yeah, it's kind of put a damper in a thing since I'm three weeks out from the marathon.

19:32.924 --> 19:38.189
[SPEAKER_27]: Yeah, that's... I've got a backup plan in place and my coach is not that worried.

19:38.269 --> 19:40.791
[SPEAKER_32]: Now, did you use DDR for any of your stamina training?

19:41.672 --> 19:45.215
[SPEAKER_27]: Just the background that I already had because he actually yelled at me not to do anything else.

19:45.255 --> 19:46.216
[SPEAKER_27]: Really?

19:46.296 --> 19:50.539
[SPEAKER_27]: For fear of hurting myself, which instead I go and I walk and run into a curb.

19:50.719 --> 19:51.480
[SPEAKER_32]: You know I had to ask.

19:52.301 --> 19:53.522
[SPEAKER_32]: Yeah, you all had to ask.

19:53.682 --> 19:55.724
[SPEAKER_27]: Actually, I haven't turned on my DDR machine and...

19:56.502 --> 20:03.184
[SPEAKER_32]: Theoretically, this show is about DDR and music games and stuff, so I have to bring it up once in a while to interject the idea.

20:03.544 --> 20:06.885
[SPEAKER_32]: The illusion that we actually play DDR once in a while still.

20:06.905 --> 20:08.545
[SPEAKER_27]: There you go.

20:09.186 --> 20:10.306
[SPEAKER_27]: So that's been most of my life.

20:10.446 --> 20:17.568
[SPEAKER_27]: Every Saturday, the most I've walked at one time is 15 miles straight, and that took about five hours, I think.

20:17.768 --> 20:17.988
[SPEAKER_32]: Wow.

20:18.607 --> 20:21.608
[SPEAKER_32]: I need time to go shop and then say hey I want that and go back.

20:43.683 --> 20:56.867
[SPEAKER_32]: Alright, um, what we're gonna do now, um, we're gonna try, now we tried to get DarkSakura on the show in the beginning, but unfortunately our Skype was going a little bit crazy, so I'm going to try and, uh, get DarkSakura back on the line here.

20:57.788 --> 20:59.468
[SPEAKER_32]: So, let's see if we have any luck here.

20:59.488 --> 21:00.488
[SPEAKER_32]: I gotta bring up Skype.

21:06.290 --> 21:06.750
[SPEAKER_32]: That's weird.

21:06.970 --> 21:08.831
[SPEAKER_32]: It almost sounds like it's calling her actual phone phone.

21:10.192 --> 21:10.532
[SPEAKER_32]: Let's see.

21:10.612 --> 21:11.392
[SPEAKER_32]: Do-do-do-do-do-do.

21:12.799 --> 21:13.840
[SPEAKER_32]: One ringy dingy dingy.

21:18.262 --> 21:19.263
[SPEAKER_21]: Hello?

21:19.763 --> 21:20.303
[SPEAKER_32]: Hello?

21:23.165 --> 21:23.645
[SPEAKER_32]: Hello?

21:24.986 --> 21:25.586
[SPEAKER_32]: That was weird.

21:25.646 --> 21:27.687
[SPEAKER_32]: It sounded all phantom-y when she came on.

21:27.947 --> 21:28.508
[SPEAKER_32]: Hello?

21:28.588 --> 21:29.508
[SPEAKER_32]: Like all broken up.

21:29.548 --> 21:29.988
[SPEAKER_32]: That's weird.

21:30.469 --> 21:32.230
[SPEAKER_32]: Do we have any other stuff going?

21:32.250 --> 21:35.892
[SPEAKER_32]: Let me lower our bandwidth here.

21:35.932 --> 21:36.912
[SPEAKER_32]: Live radio, everybody.

21:36.932 --> 21:38.253
[SPEAKER_32]: This stuff happens once in a while.

21:38.273 --> 21:40.094
[SPEAKER_32]: I'm just trying to kill any excess bandwidth we have.

21:41.334 --> 21:42.115
[SPEAKER_32]: Can you hear us, Jamie?

21:42.135 --> 21:42.235
[SPEAKER_32]: Jamie?

21:44.693 --> 21:45.694
[SPEAKER_32]: Yeah, can you hear me?

21:46.354 --> 21:51.237
[SPEAKER_32]: There, okay, we've got her a little bit there, we just got a really bad delay there, but that's alright, we can deal with that.

21:52.378 --> 21:53.858
[SPEAKER_32]: DarkSakura, what's going on?

21:53.918 --> 21:54.939
[SPEAKER_32]: How are you doing?

21:54.979 --> 22:05.285
[SPEAKER_32]: You're kind of sick, I know, but... I thought it was... Hello?

22:05.906 --> 22:07.727
[SPEAKER_32]: Hi, what's going on, DarkSakura?

22:07.947 --> 22:08.827
[SPEAKER_11]: I just closed IRC.

22:08.867 --> 22:09.308
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, okay.

22:09.768 --> 22:09.988
[SPEAKER_32]: Okay.

22:11.856 --> 22:18.938
[SPEAKER_11]: They thought I had pneumonia, and it turns out to be a really bad case of bronchitis.

22:19.478 --> 22:20.919
[SPEAKER_11]: So I'm really sick.

22:20.939 --> 22:24.260
[SPEAKER_32]: I spent most of the week sick, and it started getting better.

22:24.280 --> 22:26.140
[SPEAKER_32]: I went to the doctor on Monday.

22:42.211 --> 23:04.009
[SPEAKER_11]: and I started getting better around Wednesday, Thursday and then I had a bad relapse on Friday and my boss basically sent me to the doctor right away and he x-rayed and I have some fluid in my lungs but not enough to qualify as full-blown pneumonia so they're treating me for severe bronchitis.

23:05.330 --> 23:09.453
[SPEAKER_32]: Still, either way, bronchitis or pneumonia, no fun at all, I imagine, so...

23:10.632 --> 23:11.192
[SPEAKER_11]: It's the Muppet Show!

23:38.407 --> 23:41.589
[SPEAKER_32]: See, this is Jamie's week in a nutshell, unfortunately, is the Muppet Show here.

23:42.910 --> 23:45.171
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, and not doing my homework until the weekend.

23:46.152 --> 23:48.533
[SPEAKER_32]: Don't you get a bye from your homework, though, when you're sick?

23:49.174 --> 23:51.235
[SPEAKER_11]: No, unfortunately.

23:52.035 --> 23:58.299
[SPEAKER_32]: Some of my classes are online, so I don't necessarily... Your professors are evil for not letting you have a bye on your homework.

23:59.040 --> 24:03.042
[SPEAKER_11]: One of my teachers is giving us a week off for Thanksgiving in one of my online classes.

24:03.923 --> 24:05.844
[SPEAKER_32]: Now, what are your plans for Thanksgiving?

24:05.904 --> 24:07.365
[SPEAKER_32]: Is this going to get in the way of Thanksgiving?

24:08.135 --> 24:15.482
[SPEAKER_11]: I have no idea, but I'm tired of being stuck in the house, because I had to miss going to see Chemical Angel on Saturday.

24:16.864 --> 24:26.534
[SPEAKER_11]: I missed the show tonight, and I missed seeing my friend, one of my old co-workers who moved to Delaware was in town today, and I missed my chance to see her.

24:27.675 --> 24:29.156
[SPEAKER_11]: So we did talk on the phone for a little bit.

24:29.436 --> 24:30.898
[SPEAKER_32]: Well, that's something, okay.

24:32.538 --> 24:36.020
[SPEAKER_11]: But, it's just been bleh.

24:36.120 --> 24:37.701
[SPEAKER_11]: I slept 17 hours yesterday.

24:37.721 --> 24:38.862
[SPEAKER_32]: I had a cold.

24:38.882 --> 24:40.523
[SPEAKER_32]: This is what my cold turned into.

24:40.583 --> 24:41.023
[SPEAKER_32]: That's sucky.

24:41.043 --> 24:42.324
[SPEAKER_32]: When do the doctors think you'll be better?

25:01.339 --> 25:07.483
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know, but he put me on, I was on Keflex, which is kind of a mild antibiotic.

25:08.163 --> 25:13.406
[SPEAKER_11]: That was for the sinus infection, and then once he found out just how bad it was, he put me on doxycycline.

25:14.787 --> 25:17.608
[SPEAKER_11]: Which is, from what I understand, supposed to be pretty hardcore stuff.

25:18.129 --> 25:18.429
[SPEAKER_10]: Wow.

25:19.530 --> 25:24.192
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, so he gave me a seven day supply, but I'm going to see how I feel.

25:24.352 --> 25:26.313
[SPEAKER_11]: It's helping some, I'm getting a little better.

25:26.594 --> 25:27.134
[SPEAKER_32]: That's good.

25:27.154 --> 25:28.975
[SPEAKER_11]: I have to go back to work tomorrow.

25:29.481 --> 25:29.941
[SPEAKER_32]: Oh, gosh.

25:30.001 --> 25:31.922
[SPEAKER_32]: I hope you get a lot better by Thursday.

25:31.942 --> 25:33.142
[SPEAKER_32]: At least this is short work week.

25:33.262 --> 25:35.242
[SPEAKER_32]: I mean, there's something to look forward to there, a little bit.

25:36.662 --> 25:37.043
[SPEAKER_32]: I guess.

25:38.123 --> 25:38.863
[SPEAKER_32]: What else was I going to ask?

25:38.943 --> 25:43.764
[SPEAKER_32]: Oh, before, you know, we're going to go around the room and see how everybody else's weekend day was, but I wanted to ask, what were your thoughts?

25:43.784 --> 25:47.264
[SPEAKER_32]: I know you haven't had a chance to play games, so you haven't had a chance to check out Ultramix 3 yet.

25:47.665 --> 25:49.205
[SPEAKER_32]: What do you think of the music so far, though?

25:51.245 --> 25:52.445
[SPEAKER_11]: I wouldn't be the one to ask.

25:52.466 --> 25:53.506
[SPEAKER_11]: I haven't been paying attention.

25:53.566 --> 25:54.786
[SPEAKER_11]: I've been either...

25:55.322 --> 25:56.583
[SPEAKER_11]: Passed out or doing homework.

25:56.783 --> 25:57.304
[SPEAKER_32]: That's all right.

25:57.404 --> 25:58.044
[SPEAKER_32]: It's understandable.

25:58.585 --> 26:01.347
[SPEAKER_32]: Okay, well, Jamie, what we're going to do, we're going to go back around the room.

26:01.367 --> 26:03.889
[SPEAKER_32]: We'll bring you back later in the show, though, for some of our other stuff, okay?

26:03.909 --> 26:04.909
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

26:05.069 --> 26:05.750
[SPEAKER_32]: All right, take care.

26:05.790 --> 26:06.230
[SPEAKER_32]: Rest up.

26:07.631 --> 26:07.932
[SPEAKER_32]: All right.

26:07.992 --> 26:11.174
[SPEAKER_32]: All right, any final words for the listeners for right now?

26:12.135 --> 26:12.835
[SPEAKER_11]: Send me money.

26:13.236 --> 26:14.837
[SPEAKER_32]: Okay, we will do.

26:14.857 --> 26:16.158
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

26:16.238 --> 26:17.059
[SPEAKER_32]: All right, bye.

26:17.239 --> 26:17.759
[SPEAKER_32]: Bye.

26:17.959 --> 26:18.540
[SPEAKER_32]: Bye now.

26:19.485 --> 26:21.266
[SPEAKER_32]: Alright, we'll bring her back on the show a little later.

26:21.346 --> 26:29.292
[SPEAKER_32]: She feels bad because she wasn't here last week and she's been out, but obviously she's got to rest up, so we hope she gets better very soon.

26:29.813 --> 26:33.115
[SPEAKER_32]: Well, let's go around the room and see how other folks are having their day and their week.

26:33.296 --> 26:37.819
[SPEAKER_32]: We'll start with Angel, because she's over there just lounging around there with the microphone, ready to go.

26:39.360 --> 26:39.640
[SPEAKER_25]: What's up?

26:40.281 --> 26:40.741
[SPEAKER_32]: How was your week?

26:40.761 --> 26:42.703
[SPEAKER_25]: How was your day?

26:42.763 --> 26:42.943
[SPEAKER_25]: Good.

26:44.104 --> 26:47.606
[SPEAKER_25]: I did something I said I wasn't going to do, and you're going to laugh now.

26:47.927 --> 26:48.307
[SPEAKER_10]: What's that?

26:48.743 --> 26:50.104
[SPEAKER_25]: I rolled Alliance.

26:51.885 --> 26:52.186
[SPEAKER_32]: Wait.

26:52.666 --> 26:54.788
[SPEAKER_32]: Oh, you joined an alliance on World of Warcraft.

26:54.888 --> 26:56.029
[SPEAKER_25]: I rolled Alliance.

26:56.069 --> 26:58.631
[SPEAKER_25]: Yeah, I rolled an Alliance character on a different server.

26:58.991 --> 26:59.391
[SPEAKER_32]: Oh, okay.

26:59.431 --> 26:59.872
[SPEAKER_32]: What server?

27:00.712 --> 27:01.293
[SPEAKER_25]: Malfurion.

27:01.753 --> 27:02.033
[SPEAKER_32]: Okay.

27:03.154 --> 27:07.557
[SPEAKER_25]: Um, it's... Okay.

27:08.918 --> 27:09.599
[SPEAKER_38]: Okay.

27:09.759 --> 27:10.720
[SPEAKER_38]: He's never gonna laugh.

27:11.781 --> 27:12.161
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, yeah.

27:12.661 --> 27:13.862
[SPEAKER_32]: Well, anyway...

27:17.332 --> 27:18.513
[SPEAKER_32]: Careful, that microphone's the weird one.

27:18.533 --> 27:20.294
[SPEAKER_32]: You gotta make sure you're... Yeah, it's weird.

27:20.694 --> 27:21.574
[SPEAKER_25]: It doesn't like me.

27:21.594 --> 27:22.075
[SPEAKER_32]: There you go.

27:22.155 --> 27:22.695
[SPEAKER_25]: There you go.

27:23.115 --> 27:23.455
[SPEAKER_25]: Yay.

27:23.676 --> 27:24.536
[SPEAKER_25]: Yay for wiring.

27:24.776 --> 27:30.079
[SPEAKER_25]: Okay, so... Yeah, so I said I wasn't gonna do it, and then I did.

27:30.379 --> 27:37.743
[SPEAKER_25]: So, I don't know, everything's weird now, because I'm so used to, like, playing Horde and stuff, so... So now you're having to play as the bad guy.

27:38.924 --> 27:43.166
[SPEAKER_25]: Well, actually, yeah.

27:43.186 --> 27:43.747
[SPEAKER_25]: In a way.

27:43.767 --> 27:45.067
[SPEAKER_32]: Or what else have you been playing this week?

27:45.107 --> 27:46.168
[SPEAKER_32]: Not just World of Warcraft, but...

27:47.757 --> 27:52.599
[SPEAKER_25]: Oh, uh, um, yeah, Guitar Hero, because I just got that tool.

27:52.859 --> 27:53.099
[SPEAKER_32]: Yeah?

27:53.159 --> 27:54.540
[SPEAKER_32]: How's Guitar Hero working out for you?

27:55.260 --> 28:01.943
[SPEAKER_25]: Uh, sometimes the notes go too fast, but if I concentrate on what's going where, everything's cool.

28:01.983 --> 28:03.884
[SPEAKER_25]: So, what else did we get this week?

28:04.004 --> 28:05.964
[SPEAKER_32]: What do you think about Guitar Hero compared to Guitar Freaks?

28:07.985 --> 28:14.968
[SPEAKER_25]: Um, I haven't, I didn't get to play Guitar Freaks that much, because, you know, when I first started coming up here and stuff with you guys...

28:15.774 --> 28:17.055
[SPEAKER_25]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

28:35.875 --> 28:39.899
[SPEAKER_25]: All is good, but I still like my World of Warcraft Have you been on Mario Kart Frenzy this week?

28:40.980 --> 28:51.849
[SPEAKER_25]: Yes, I got to play with Slinky and BigRandPimp and DJ Ranma S and just, you know, all of my buddies, it's fun The online thing is crazy, isn't it?

28:52.009 --> 28:54.892
[SPEAKER_25]: Yes it is, and there's no lag, at least I don't think

28:55.720 --> 28:56.360
[SPEAKER_25]: Is there lag?

28:56.540 --> 28:57.041
[SPEAKER_32]: No, not really.

28:57.061 --> 28:57.641
[SPEAKER_32]: I don't notice it.

28:58.361 --> 28:58.661
[SPEAKER_25]: Yeah.

28:58.681 --> 28:59.062
[SPEAKER_32]: It's great.

28:59.202 --> 29:05.044
[SPEAKER_25]: So, I've been doing a lot of gaming this week when I should be concentrating on school, which I'm doing too.

29:05.885 --> 29:07.886
[SPEAKER_25]: But gaming's much more fun.

29:08.186 --> 29:08.946
[SPEAKER_32]: Especially this week.

29:08.966 --> 29:11.067
[SPEAKER_32]: This is such a big week with all the releases that came out last week.

29:11.087 --> 29:11.848
[SPEAKER_25]: All the games.

29:12.468 --> 29:14.889
[SPEAKER_32]: Going into next week and the 360 and all that crap.

29:15.509 --> 29:16.890
[SPEAKER_25]: I don't even have a PSP yet.

29:17.550 --> 29:17.871
[SPEAKER_25]: Oh well.

29:17.951 --> 29:18.231
[SPEAKER_25]: Soon.

29:18.551 --> 29:18.971
[SPEAKER_32]: Anything else?

29:19.411 --> 29:19.671
[SPEAKER_25]: No.

29:19.972 --> 29:20.212
[SPEAKER_32]: Alright.

29:20.272 --> 29:21.012
[SPEAKER_25]: I don't think so.

29:22.233 --> 29:23.253
[SPEAKER_25]: I feel like a bat.

29:25.709 --> 29:25.969
[SPEAKER_32]: Angel, wake up!

29:26.069 --> 29:26.730
[SPEAKER_32]: Angel, wake up!

29:46.713 --> 29:49.035
[SPEAKER_38]: I actually have to learn some basic braille.

29:49.055 --> 29:52.078
[SPEAKER_38]: Or you have to learn to write really big.

29:52.118 --> 29:55.422
[SPEAKER_38]: Actually, instead of that, what we do is I write audio scripts for stuff.

29:55.442 --> 29:57.243
[SPEAKER_38]: Say for a math problem, there's a

30:10.799 --> 30:14.845
[SPEAKER_38]: Drawing of a triangle, which is like, you know, four or five, you know, whatever the Pythagorean triple is.

30:15.346 --> 30:17.790
[SPEAKER_38]: But the thing is, of course, obviously a blind person can't see that.

30:18.311 --> 30:21.656
[SPEAKER_38]: And, you know, you can't necessarily make like a raised diagram for them to feel around.

30:21.716 --> 30:23.379
[SPEAKER_38]: So you actually have to write the description like,

30:23.800 --> 30:25.681
[SPEAKER_38]: There is a triangle, ABC.

30:26.161 --> 30:31.564
[SPEAKER_38]: You know, B is a right angle, and, you know, side AB equals 4, and BC equals 5, you know, by this logic.

30:31.584 --> 30:32.264
[SPEAKER_38]: That's hard!

30:32.785 --> 30:34.386
[SPEAKER_38]: It's so hard to do, and you can't see.

30:34.946 --> 30:42.190
[SPEAKER_38]: It's really like a, kind of a crash course in articulation, and, like, basically, you're kind of thinking, well, if someone was from another planet, how would you describe all this stuff to them?

30:42.210 --> 30:42.630
[SPEAKER_38]: So it's...

30:43.160 --> 30:45.801
[SPEAKER_32]: How would you describe DDR to somebody who is visually impaired?

30:50.704 --> 30:53.966
[SPEAKER_32]: There is loud Japanese Eurobeat music playing.

30:54.826 --> 30:58.748
[SPEAKER_32]: There are arrows slowly crawling up the screen.

30:58.988 --> 31:02.070
[SPEAKER_27]: But if you're visually impaired, how do you know what an arrow is?

31:03.852 --> 31:06.434
[SPEAKER_32]: Easy, all the time.

31:07.094 --> 31:13.357
[SPEAKER_32]: There is somebody dancing on a pad with arrows and the pad lights up when they step on it.

31:13.938 --> 31:17.960
[SPEAKER_32]: This person looks really gay playing this game.

31:19.961 --> 31:20.842
[SPEAKER_32]: Shut up, Rob.

31:20.862 --> 31:33.189
[SPEAKER_32]: This person is holding on to a bar that is pink in color with a black top that has since been ripped off by little six-year-old shits at Golf Land.

31:37.475 --> 31:38.876
[SPEAKER_32]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

31:59.665 --> 32:16.595
[SPEAKER_38]: Oh, actually, the Create a Wrestler mode has been around since, like, I think, a couple versions ago, but this time they've gotten even more detailed with things, like, you know, this time you can customize your entrance, like, you know, different types of, you can have, like, fireworks go off, you know, at certain points, or you can, like,

32:16.915 --> 32:21.397
[SPEAKER_38]: Have the camera pan around to someone else or, you know, all sorts of... That's great.

32:21.417 --> 32:24.599
[SPEAKER_38]: You can do the techno, you know, lighting, all sorts of things.

32:24.619 --> 32:30.062
[SPEAKER_32]: The game makes you spend, like, an hour coming up with a perfect introduction and, like, no time on the actual game.

32:30.122 --> 32:31.082
[SPEAKER_32]: I'll put it like this.

32:31.262 --> 32:34.024
[SPEAKER_38]: When I was making my first character, it took me about three and a half hours.

32:34.044 --> 32:34.684
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, my God.

32:35.104 --> 32:43.929
[SPEAKER_38]: You know, that's... But that's because not only are you making the character, but because it's a new game, you want to see what new types of hairstyles or, like, clothes you could put on people, so...

32:44.389 --> 32:47.490
[SPEAKER_38]: It's just exploration, really, but it's still pretty damn fun.

32:47.850 --> 32:51.552
[SPEAKER_32]: That's kind of like Soul Calibur III has a make-a-fighter mode.

32:51.592 --> 32:53.172
[SPEAKER_32]: It's pretty intensive, too.

32:53.592 --> 32:58.834
[SPEAKER_32]: But you don't get to do your intro, which is too bad, because Soul Calibur III practically has wrestling intros.

32:58.854 --> 33:04.116
[SPEAKER_32]: It's like, the soul will burn as two entrants come for the next battle.

33:04.996 --> 33:08.818
[SPEAKER_21]: I shall destroy you with every inch of my being!

33:09.670 --> 33:11.571
[SPEAKER_21]: Do we have to fight now?

33:12.072 --> 33:14.253
[SPEAKER_32]: Let there be a great battle!

33:15.234 --> 33:19.597
[SPEAKER_32]: Swear to God, Soul Calibur goes on and on with the setups of these fights.

33:20.958 --> 33:27.043
[SPEAKER_25]: Rob, you would do a good intro for the next World of Warcraft thing?

33:27.283 --> 33:29.264
[SPEAKER_32]: I should be Soul Calibur 4, it's all about me.

33:29.865 --> 33:34.028
[SPEAKER_31]: I am the Pencils Pope, you killed my father, prefer to die!

33:36.129 --> 33:36.630
[SPEAKER_32]: Alright...

33:37.910 --> 33:39.672
[SPEAKER_38]: Anyway, sorry, I keep cutting you off, buddy

34:01.823 --> 34:03.044
[SPEAKER_38]: But it's still pretty cool.

34:03.064 --> 34:07.546
[SPEAKER_38]: I think the most fun though is just creating the characters and like, you know, making mockeries of all your friends.

34:08.026 --> 34:09.807
[SPEAKER_38]: You know, that's the fun of it.

34:09.847 --> 34:12.489
[SPEAKER_32]: Making characters that look like your friends and then kicking the shit out of them.

34:12.789 --> 34:14.090
[SPEAKER_38]: That's what we do essentially.

34:14.270 --> 34:16.311
[SPEAKER_38]: Everybody in like RTF and Step Squad.

34:16.791 --> 34:18.612
[SPEAKER_38]: Yeah, we just have like these big get-togethers.

34:19.252 --> 34:22.494
[SPEAKER_32]: I make my characters in Soul Calibur 3 look really, really faggy.

34:22.574 --> 34:23.274
[SPEAKER_32]: Like the best I can.

34:23.535 --> 34:27.717
[SPEAKER_32]: Like I gave one a pope hat and a clown necklace and no pants.

34:29.645 --> 34:33.507
[SPEAKER_32]: And he's wearing like a little jockstrap or something where I swear you can like see his ass.

34:34.888 --> 34:35.588
[SPEAKER_32]: And it's purple.

34:36.248 --> 34:37.149
[SPEAKER_16]: For no real reason.

34:37.169 --> 34:39.250
[SPEAKER_32]: I gotta see this character.

34:39.270 --> 34:39.690
[SPEAKER_38]: It's great.

34:39.790 --> 34:41.931
[SPEAKER_38]: I love creating a character in Soul Calibur 3.

34:41.971 --> 34:43.092
[SPEAKER_38]: Yeah, let's see.

34:43.112 --> 34:43.752
[SPEAKER_38]: What else?

34:43.812 --> 34:47.434
[SPEAKER_38]: Guitar Hero, obviously, has been also getting a lot of playtime.

34:47.634 --> 34:48.594
[SPEAKER_38]: That's pretty fun.

34:48.814 --> 34:50.595
[SPEAKER_38]: And, uh, let's see.

34:50.735 --> 34:53.657
[SPEAKER_38]: And, uh, yeah, those are pretty much the two main games I've been playing this week.

34:54.397 --> 34:56.678
[SPEAKER_38]: And, yeah, everything's been pretty good all together.

34:56.718 --> 34:58.179
[SPEAKER_38]: And today, hey, I'm here, you know.

34:59.003 --> 34:59.503
[SPEAKER_38]: 20 November.

35:00.884 --> 35:01.184
[SPEAKER_38]: All right.

35:02.365 --> 35:03.445
[SPEAKER_38]: Shark's Girl, how was your week?

35:03.465 --> 35:03.885
[SPEAKER_32]: How was your day?

35:04.746 --> 35:10.868
[SPEAKER_27]: My week has been the same as every week for the last, I don't know how many, I walked a lot.

35:11.709 --> 35:14.170
[SPEAKER_27]: God, I've probably done over 250 miles at this point.

35:14.270 --> 35:15.090
[SPEAKER_32]: Keep you healthy, though.

35:15.110 --> 35:15.470
[SPEAKER_32]: Oh, yeah.

35:15.491 --> 35:16.091
[SPEAKER_27]: I've lost a lot of weight.

35:16.111 --> 35:17.111
[SPEAKER_32]: I should be training for a marathon.

35:17.131 --> 35:17.591
[SPEAKER_27]: Oh, it's great.

35:17.992 --> 35:19.512
[SPEAKER_27]: But, yeah, I worked.

35:20.073 --> 35:20.633
[SPEAKER_27]: I walked.

35:20.693 --> 35:23.854
[SPEAKER_27]: I actually went to a store called Sur La Table.

35:23.894 --> 35:27.696
[SPEAKER_27]: I don't know if anyone else, I don't know if it's a Bay Area thing or if it's nationwide or what.

35:28.103 --> 35:32.367
[SPEAKER_27]: But it's one of those places where it's like a cooking utensil store, but they also have like a kitchen and stuff.

35:33.288 --> 35:36.751
[SPEAKER_27]: And my work hired it out and brought a bunch of people we work with in.

35:36.771 --> 35:40.135
[SPEAKER_27]: There were like 40 people there, and we all drank wine and made food.

35:40.655 --> 35:41.716
[SPEAKER_27]: And it was really entertaining.

35:42.517 --> 35:46.341
[SPEAKER_27]: And I now have a really good recipe for petite beef wellingtons if anyone wants it.

35:46.941 --> 35:48.143
[SPEAKER_27]: But yes, I did that.

35:48.203 --> 35:48.623
[SPEAKER_27]: I walked.

35:49.371 --> 35:50.411
[SPEAKER_27]: and aforementioned walking.

35:51.672 --> 35:55.773
[SPEAKER_27]: I'm very, very lucky because the one game I have been playing a lot of is Guitar Hero.

35:56.133 --> 35:58.393
[SPEAKER_27]: And I was carrying my guitar when I fell.

35:59.234 --> 36:03.775
[SPEAKER_27]: And I'm just lucky the back of it hit the curb and took chunks out of it versus the front or the buttons.

36:04.055 --> 36:04.595
[SPEAKER_32]: Oh, yeah.

36:04.635 --> 36:08.836
[SPEAKER_32]: Yeah, so... Wait, how did you fall with a Guitar Hero controller?

36:08.936 --> 36:10.377
[SPEAKER_32]: I was... You know I have to ask.

36:10.497 --> 36:12.557
[SPEAKER_27]: I was holding a bunch of stuff.

36:12.597 --> 36:14.318
[SPEAKER_27]: I was going to my car from Mel's.

36:14.378 --> 36:15.018
[SPEAKER_27]: It was like 11.30 at night.

36:16.722 --> 36:46.185
[SPEAKER_27]: and I was wearing my heels from work which I don't wear like skinny ones but still they're heels so I had my Guitar Hero controller slung around my no I was holding the neck of it in my left hand I had my purse up there and I was holding something else in my right hand I stepped up on a curb and I think I stepped onto a rock and it turned out from underneath me and I went straight down next thing I know I'm like why am I on the ground and then Mel's looking at me like why are you on the ground and then it hits me that the best thing to do in this situation would be curse loudly so I did and

36:46.744 --> 36:53.588
[SPEAKER_27]: Probably scared the shit out of the neighbors, and yeah, so, yeah, the Guitar Hero controller hit the ground right next to me.

36:54.429 --> 36:57.671
[SPEAKER_27]: So, I have a few little gouges out of the back of it, but it still plays.

36:57.791 --> 36:59.772
[SPEAKER_32]: But as long as it works, that's the important part.

36:59.792 --> 37:00.032
[SPEAKER_27]: Oh, yeah.

37:00.312 --> 37:01.513
[SPEAKER_27]: Yeah, it still works, trust me.

37:02.654 --> 37:03.995
[SPEAKER_32]: Anything else you want to share about your week and your day?

37:06.356 --> 37:07.657
[SPEAKER_32]: Have you been doing the Mario Kart thing?

37:07.997 --> 37:09.678
[SPEAKER_27]: No.

37:09.738 --> 37:12.340
[SPEAKER_27]: Okay, this is when you kick me out of the house.

37:12.540 --> 37:13.801
[SPEAKER_32]: No, I'm not going to kick you out of the house.

37:13.861 --> 37:15.582
[SPEAKER_27]: I've never played Mario Kart ever.

37:18.078 --> 37:20.640
[SPEAKER_27]: The look of stunned silence is amazing.

37:20.820 --> 37:22.522
[SPEAKER_32]: I'm sorry, I have to point and laugh.

37:24.804 --> 37:26.325
[SPEAKER_32]: How did that happen?

37:26.365 --> 37:27.486
[SPEAKER_32]: You just not interested?

37:28.007 --> 37:34.052
[SPEAKER_27]: I just never really got into it, and none of my friends really had it, so I didn't have exposure to it that way.

37:34.752 --> 37:36.514
[SPEAKER_27]: And now you're handing me a DS with Mario Kart?

37:36.534 --> 37:38.455
[SPEAKER_27]: I was just telling Mel that I need to play it.

37:38.475 --> 37:38.856
[SPEAKER_27]: Play me!

37:38.956 --> 37:39.937
[SPEAKER_27]: Play me, Mel!

37:39.997 --> 37:41.998
[SPEAKER_27]: His DS is telling me to play it.

37:42.199 --> 37:42.559
Play!

37:43.360 --> 37:43.800
[SPEAKER_32]: There you go.

37:44.281 --> 37:47.782
[SPEAKER_25]: Actually, mine is also sitting over there, so you can play.

37:48.523 --> 38:01.429
[SPEAKER_27]: So, yeah, pretty much my week has been walking, and everything is going to be walking up until December 11th, upon which at night it's party and collapse, and then it's hang out in Hawaii time, and then life returns to normal.

38:02.390 --> 38:02.790
[SPEAKER_32]: All right.

38:02.830 --> 38:02.910
[SPEAKER_27]: Yeah.

38:03.342 --> 38:03.682
[SPEAKER_27]: That was it.

38:04.062 --> 38:04.902
[SPEAKER_32]: Sounds good.

38:04.922 --> 38:11.564
[SPEAKER_32]: Now, what's this part about how I'm going to be joining you in Hawaii, how you actually got me a ticket and was going to surprise me on the show with it tonight?

38:11.884 --> 38:12.565
[SPEAKER_32]: What was this about?

38:12.785 --> 38:16.126
[SPEAKER_27]: Well, darn, you ruined the surprise, damn it.

38:17.286 --> 38:21.787
[SPEAKER_32]: Maybe next year, maybe next year I'll train, but it's a lot of time.

38:21.867 --> 38:28.629
[SPEAKER_27]: It is a lot of time, but honestly, it's one of the best experiences I've ever had in my life, and I'm so close with all these people that I've been training with.

38:28.749 --> 38:32.110
[SPEAKER_27]: It's a big commitment, but it's totally worth it.

38:32.622 --> 38:35.485
[SPEAKER_27]: And if anyone wants to talk to me about it, go ahead and email me, find me.

38:35.685 --> 38:37.327
[SPEAKER_27]: I'll put a post on Orange Lounge or something.

38:37.587 --> 38:38.027
[SPEAKER_32]: Sounds good.

38:38.207 --> 38:38.408
[SPEAKER_32]: Cool.

38:38.548 --> 38:38.828
[SPEAKER_31]: All right.

38:39.248 --> 38:40.129
[SPEAKER_31]: Loki, how was your week?

38:40.149 --> 38:40.510
[SPEAKER_31]: How was your day?

38:42.351 --> 38:43.673
[SPEAKER_31]: My week was good until today.

38:44.754 --> 38:48.277
[SPEAKER_31]: Or actually, I should say, yeah, yeah, until about today.

38:51.300 --> 38:57.306
[SPEAKER_31]: Last week, because I hadn't gotten an oil change in forever, I decided to go and get an oil change for my car.

38:58.499 --> 39:02.505
[SPEAKER_31]: And like luck as it would be, they fucked up my car again.

39:02.525 --> 39:05.691
[SPEAKER_32]: If this isn't the same place that wrecked your old car, thank god.

39:05.731 --> 39:08.976
[SPEAKER_31]: Different place, different car, still fucking stuff up.

39:09.363 --> 39:14.525
[SPEAKER_31]: So now my car leaks coolant and overheats thanks to them.

39:14.905 --> 39:16.625
[SPEAKER_31]: And so now I got to get that fixed.

39:17.065 --> 39:18.126
[SPEAKER_31]: I got to take work off.

39:18.566 --> 39:19.646
[SPEAKER_31]: It's just a pain in the ass.

39:19.986 --> 39:20.526
[SPEAKER_31]: It really is.

39:22.367 --> 39:28.529
[SPEAKER_31]: However, aside from that, because my whole week's been kind of doing the roller coaster ride of highs and lows.

39:28.989 --> 39:37.631
[SPEAKER_31]: Last night we went to the strip club, and that was kind of fun, because we had titties in our face all night, and lap dances, and so Nelly had a pretty good time.

39:38.931 --> 39:44.072
[SPEAKER_31]: And then, I don't know, that was pretty much it, yeah, that was the highlights of the week.

39:44.432 --> 39:58.115
[SPEAKER_31]: Oh, I have Xbox 360 games and no Xbox system, and GameStop was wonderful and decided to go ahead and sell my copy of Project Gotham Racing, even though I had a pre-order for it, and came there, showed them my receipt, and they're like, uh, oops.

40:02.921 --> 40:07.967
[SPEAKER_31]: And then I got a recorded message saying, You're not going to get your system until after Christmas!

40:08.328 --> 40:11.712
[SPEAKER_31]: Which, you know, that's based on their current allocations of what they're going to get.

40:12.874 --> 40:15.877
[SPEAKER_31]: But it's just going to be a big giant circus this week.

40:16.458 --> 40:16.598
[SPEAKER_31]: So...

40:17.392 --> 40:18.993
[SPEAKER_31]: I'm looking forward to completely ignoring

40:37.586 --> 40:46.993
[SPEAKER_32]: I'm freaking addicted already You said you've been playing all week and I have not run into you once I haven't touched World of Warcraft in five days I know

41:07.867 --> 41:13.712
[SPEAKER_32]: I actually got to play the Mario Kart arcade version yesterday.

41:27.535 --> 41:28.675
[SPEAKER_38]: at Milpitas Golf Land.

41:28.695 --> 41:29.975
[SPEAKER_38]: It's actually pretty fun.

41:29.996 --> 41:34.216
[SPEAKER_38]: They got not only Nintendo, but Namco also was in on it.

41:34.616 --> 41:36.477
[SPEAKER_38]: So now you can write as Pac-Man, Ms.

41:36.517 --> 41:37.497
[SPEAKER_38]: Pac-Man, or Blinky.

41:37.957 --> 41:38.577
[SPEAKER_32]: I heard about that.

41:38.597 --> 41:39.417
[SPEAKER_32]: That's so badass.

41:39.697 --> 41:41.038
[SPEAKER_32]: So they have that at Milpitas Golf Land?

41:41.118 --> 41:41.458
[SPEAKER_38]: Yes, they do.

41:41.478 --> 41:44.098
[SPEAKER_38]: The only thing that sucks is they don't have card readers.

41:44.898 --> 41:53.000
[SPEAKER_38]: And it's like, oh, actually, in a way, it's bad, but it's good, too, because if there was a card reader, I probably would have dropped like 20 bucks yesterday.

41:53.587 --> 42:00.432
[SPEAKER_32]: Okay, so I'm going to a birthday party in Hayward, like, in two weeks, so now I'm gonna have to swing by Milpitas, even though that's, like, an hour drive, I don't care.

42:00.512 --> 42:01.713
[SPEAKER_32]: About two weeks?

42:01.733 --> 42:03.875
[SPEAKER_32]: Like, the first of December or something, it's like a Friday.

42:04.075 --> 42:04.875
[SPEAKER_32]: Yeah, I'll definitely let you know.

42:05.115 --> 42:05.456
[SPEAKER_32]: Absolutely.

42:06.617 --> 42:06.897
[SPEAKER_32]: Alright.

42:06.917 --> 42:07.097
[SPEAKER_32]: Yeah.

42:07.297 --> 42:13.422
[SPEAKER_38]: The only, like, drawback to this is you can't totally, I mean, the power sliding isn't, like, totally there, but you can do, like, jump drifts.

42:13.642 --> 42:13.842
[SPEAKER_32]: Hmm.

42:14.181 --> 42:16.682
[SPEAKER_38]: So, you know, it's a little different, but they have, like, all the courses there.

42:16.702 --> 42:19.343
[SPEAKER_32]: You can do the jump drifts in this, too, kind of use that same thing, yeah.

42:19.363 --> 42:22.744
[SPEAKER_38]: Yeah, where you, like, dig into the gas and you hit the brake and then, yeah, you can do that.

42:22.764 --> 42:23.265
[SPEAKER_32]: Sort of, sort of.

42:23.285 --> 42:25.826
[SPEAKER_32]: And this one you wiggle back and forth after you do a jump, yeah.

42:26.066 --> 42:26.366
[SPEAKER_32]: Oh, wow.

42:26.406 --> 42:27.066
[SPEAKER_32]: It's kind of interesting.

42:27.586 --> 42:28.127
[SPEAKER_32]: So, anyway.

42:28.707 --> 42:30.247
[SPEAKER_32]: All right, we're going to go to another break.

42:30.608 --> 42:32.468
[SPEAKER_32]: I want to talk a lot about Ultramix 3 tonight.

42:32.548 --> 42:34.829
[SPEAKER_32]: I know you guys have your opinions you want to state, too.

42:35.049 --> 42:36.310
[SPEAKER_32]: We're going to get to all of that.

42:36.750 --> 42:39.533
[SPEAKER_32]: Right after this next break, but we need to take a break because I need something to drink.

42:39.993 --> 42:40.614
[SPEAKER_32]: Something stiff.

42:41.094 --> 42:43.957
[SPEAKER_32]: In this break, we're going to hear some more Ultramix 3 music.

42:44.057 --> 42:46.559
[SPEAKER_32]: In this break, we're going to hear I Am Gothic, because I love this song.

42:47.160 --> 42:47.900
[SPEAKER_32]: Where's Your Head At?

42:47.960 --> 42:48.941
[SPEAKER_32]: by Basement Jacks.

42:49.602 --> 42:51.904
[SPEAKER_32]: Nari Narin by J. Dobby.

42:51.964 --> 42:53.826
[SPEAKER_32]: It's a little bit of a Bollywood type.

42:53.866 --> 42:54.406
[SPEAKER_32]: It's kind of cool.

42:54.667 --> 42:57.930
[SPEAKER_32]: And then Stakeout, the Ultramix by Freeze Pop.

42:57.950 --> 42:59.211
[SPEAKER_32]: So we're going to hear all that this break.

42:59.231 --> 43:01.413
[SPEAKER_32]: We'll be back with more Orange Lawn Radio after this.

43:39.850 --> 43:40.711
Thanks for watching!

44:09.311 --> 44:10.654
Thanks for watching!

44:55.298 --> 44:56.481
Thank you for watching!

48:22.302 --> 48:23.063
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you for watching!

48:54.111 --> 48:54.971
[SPEAKER_12]: Thanks for watching!

49:55.066 --> 49:58.933
[SPEAKER_32]: Orange Lounge Radio, Mamani Music, and more.

50:01.254 --> 50:02.334
[SPEAKER_32]: We're back here on Orange Launch Radio.

50:02.354 --> 50:04.535
[SPEAKER_32]: In that break, you heard I Am Gothic by Spray.

50:04.575 --> 50:05.736
[SPEAKER_32]: Where's your head at, Basement Jacks?

50:05.756 --> 50:07.396
[SPEAKER_32]: Which, by the way, has a very freaky video.

50:07.456 --> 50:09.097
[SPEAKER_32]: It's in that mix.

50:09.697 --> 50:13.859
[SPEAKER_32]: Nari Nari by J. Dobby and Stakeout, the Ultra Mix by Freeze Pop.

50:14.559 --> 50:18.401
[SPEAKER_32]: I don't want to say too much, but please keep your fingers crossed for me.

50:19.201 --> 50:21.982
[SPEAKER_32]: I got a contact over at Freeze Pop, and I'm trying to get them on the show.

50:22.302 --> 50:26.884
[SPEAKER_32]: So, please pray to whatever deity that we can get them on the show, because I love Freeze Pop.

50:26.904 --> 50:28.465
[SPEAKER_32]: I would love to have them on the program.

50:28.505 --> 50:31.166
[SPEAKER_32]: And if anybody out there from the Freeze Pop camp is listening, please come

50:33.307 --> 50:36.929
[SPEAKER_27]: We made our freaks look so uber chic.

50:38.030 --> 50:38.871
[SPEAKER_32]: We shop at Target.

50:40.171 --> 50:41.172
[SPEAKER_32]: Trust me, no, seriously.

50:41.372 --> 50:43.473
[SPEAKER_32]: I shop so much at Target.

50:43.513 --> 50:44.274
[SPEAKER_32]: It's disgusting.

50:44.314 --> 50:45.995
[SPEAKER_32]: Probably this whole house is furnished with Target.

50:46.555 --> 50:50.598
[SPEAKER_27]: The thing with Target that reminds me is the sad news about Vanilla Coke's passing.

50:50.718 --> 50:57.622
[SPEAKER_27]: I can remember going to a Target with you and finding every damn bottle of Vanilla Coke they had and buying it when it first came out.

50:58.703 --> 51:01.925
[SPEAKER_32]: I have that picture in my cubicle at work.

51:02.605 --> 51:03.646
[SPEAKER_32]: It makes me sad.

51:03.666 --> 51:06.807
[SPEAKER_32]: I'll have to put that next to the picture of me as a toddler with Crystal Pepsi.

51:07.308 --> 51:07.668
[SPEAKER_32]: I'm kidding.

51:08.248 --> 51:08.428
[SPEAKER_32]: Alright.

51:08.448 --> 51:08.508
[SPEAKER_32]: Rob!

51:13.402 --> 51:13.682
[SPEAKER_21]: What?

51:13.702 --> 51:15.343
[SPEAKER_21]: I drank that stuff, too.

51:15.784 --> 51:16.144
[SPEAKER_32]: No, I know.

51:16.184 --> 51:16.404
[SPEAKER_32]: I did.

51:16.464 --> 51:17.244
[SPEAKER_32]: I wasn't a toddler.

51:17.645 --> 51:19.926
[SPEAKER_32]: That shit was out when we were in, what, junior high or so?

51:19.946 --> 51:20.767
[SPEAKER_27]: We're about the same age.

51:20.807 --> 51:21.887
[SPEAKER_27]: I used to drink it all the time.

51:23.008 --> 51:25.409
[SPEAKER_25]: Don't forget, I'm not that much younger than you are.

51:26.710 --> 51:27.010
[SPEAKER_25]: Sir.

51:28.351 --> 51:29.672
[SPEAKER_32]: I'm getting yelled at by the chat room.

51:29.812 --> 51:32.134
[SPEAKER_32]: Chat room, by the way, www.orangesoundtrader.com.

51:32.154 --> 51:32.714
[SPEAKER_32]: Click on chat.

51:33.234 --> 51:35.376
[SPEAKER_32]: MPQ says, Stop saying Tar-jay.

51:35.736 --> 51:39.498
[SPEAKER_32]: Hey, it's better than the new one I've started hearing recently because all my friends shop there.

51:39.518 --> 51:39.798
[SPEAKER_32]: Tar-gay.

51:39.818 --> 51:40.339
[SPEAKER_32]: Tar-gay.

51:43.148 --> 51:44.669
[SPEAKER_32]: So if you want, buddy.

51:45.309 --> 51:45.809
[SPEAKER_32]: No, all right.

51:45.869 --> 51:46.830
[SPEAKER_32]: We all know it's Target.

51:47.270 --> 51:47.891
[SPEAKER_32]: We all know it's Target.

51:47.991 --> 51:49.071
[SPEAKER_32]: But I like that Target.

51:49.872 --> 51:50.572
[SPEAKER_27]: It makes it sound chic.

51:50.692 --> 51:53.294
[SPEAKER_32]: It makes it sound like Saks Fifth Target.

51:53.694 --> 51:54.134
[SPEAKER_32]: It's great.

51:54.834 --> 51:56.215
[SPEAKER_27]: We have to feel upper class, okay?

51:56.315 --> 51:56.956
[SPEAKER_32]: Yeah, I know.

51:57.356 --> 51:58.476
[SPEAKER_27]: At least it's not Kmartay.

52:00.748 --> 52:06.412
[SPEAKER_32]: Kmart is like, you heard that Martha Stewart was thinking about buying Kmart and they were going to call it K-Martha.

52:07.833 --> 52:08.894
[SPEAKER_22]: That's not a fucking joke.

52:08.914 --> 52:09.834
[SPEAKER_22]: That's not a fucking joke.

52:11.656 --> 52:14.778
[SPEAKER_32]: But they're having like this huge sale and anyway, it's just ghetto.

52:14.898 --> 52:15.758
[SPEAKER_32]: Kmart's ghetto.

52:15.778 --> 52:17.079
[SPEAKER_32]: Why would Martha Stewart want to buy Kmart?

52:17.099 --> 52:17.900
[SPEAKER_32]: Kmart is ghetto.

52:18.399 --> 52:20.040
[SPEAKER_32]: and I'll see you next time.

52:35.851 --> 52:37.592
[SPEAKER_32]: DGR Ultramix 3

52:56.996 --> 52:57.437
[SPEAKER_32]: No, I'm kidding.

52:57.457 --> 53:00.161
[SPEAKER_32]: There's actually a lot to like about Ultima 3.

53:00.201 --> 53:01.062
[SPEAKER_32]: I like Xbox Live.

53:01.403 --> 53:02.485
[SPEAKER_32]: Xbox Live is a lot cleaner.

53:02.845 --> 53:03.987
[SPEAKER_32]: It's a lot better, I think.

53:04.468 --> 53:07.272
[SPEAKER_32]: I like the fact that you can send messages to people within Xbox Live.

53:07.592 --> 53:10.657
[SPEAKER_32]: I like how you don't have to quit out of the game and come back in to...

53:12.219 --> 53:15.661
[SPEAKER_32]: Download new stuff that the new content stuff is integrated into the game.

53:15.881 --> 53:23.105
[SPEAKER_32]: I think they did a very good job with that and sending the messages back to each other and seeing who all is online playing the game, not necessarily in your room.

53:23.425 --> 53:24.306
[SPEAKER_32]: I think that's all great.

53:24.386 --> 53:26.667
[SPEAKER_32]: So the Xbox Live portion looks great.

53:26.787 --> 53:27.027
[SPEAKER_32]: Love it.

53:28.008 --> 53:28.628
[SPEAKER_32]: Song list.

53:29.560 --> 53:30.480
[SPEAKER_32]: It's half and half for me.

53:30.881 --> 53:32.862
[SPEAKER_32]: There's some awesome stuff in the song list.

53:32.942 --> 53:36.003
[SPEAKER_32]: I love the spray song.

53:36.063 --> 53:37.564
[SPEAKER_32]: I love the real life song.

53:37.604 --> 53:39.085
[SPEAKER_32]: I love the gothy and trancy stuff.

53:39.125 --> 53:39.845
[SPEAKER_32]: I always do, though.

53:40.325 --> 53:44.547
[SPEAKER_32]: And then I love some of the stuff that they brought over from other Bomani stuff.

53:44.727 --> 53:46.408
[SPEAKER_32]: Like Right on Time from Guitar Freaks is great.

53:46.448 --> 53:48.349
[SPEAKER_32]: Himawari from Guitar Freaks is well.

53:50.190 --> 53:53.832
[SPEAKER_32]: Parade of the Wooden Soldiers, WTF, but that's kind of neat.

53:54.572 --> 53:56.713
[SPEAKER_32]: Akumajo Dracula Medley, of course, was an awesome pick.

53:56.993 --> 53:57.834
[SPEAKER_32]: They picked some good stuff.

53:58.274 --> 54:27.849
[SPEAKER_32]: but then the song list kind of goes weird for me because they tried with the song list in Ultramix 3 to be much more eclectic and that is very obvious like they have more rap type stuff with the Alphabet Aerobics and Run DMC and they have some rock type stuff with Good Charlotte and The Clash and NoFX and then they have some old stuff like they have Ray Charles with What'd You Say let me play a clip of some of these like songs

54:28.209 --> 54:43.261
[SPEAKER_32]: These are songs that literally made me go WTF when I brought them up in Ultramix 3 And I actually, I got a copy of some of this music so we can play it for you guys here on the show tonight I'm not gonna play the whole one, but I wanna see if you guys have the same reaction I did to this, okay?

54:43.561 --> 54:48.305
[SPEAKER_32]: Imagine you're going through the song list and then suddenly you come across this, okay?

54:48.725 --> 54:51.868
[SPEAKER_32]: Listen to a little clip of this song, and imagine arrows coming up at the screen and all that

54:53.826 --> 54:54.727
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay, here's my thing.

55:18.357 --> 55:19.841
[SPEAKER_32]: Is that song a good song?

55:19.901 --> 55:21.043
[SPEAKER_32]: Yes, it's an awesome song.

55:21.104 --> 55:21.945
[SPEAKER_32]: It's a wonderful song.

55:22.006 --> 55:22.888
[SPEAKER_32]: It's an incredible song.

55:22.928 --> 55:23.589
[SPEAKER_32]: I love that song.

55:23.629 --> 55:24.050
[SPEAKER_32]: It's great.

55:24.491 --> 55:25.955
[SPEAKER_32]: Is it a good choice for DDR?

55:26.610 --> 55:28.692
[SPEAKER_32]: Hell no, it's not a good pick for DDR.

55:28.872 --> 55:29.913
[SPEAKER_32]: Hell no.

55:30.073 --> 55:30.273
[SPEAKER_32]: What?

55:30.554 --> 55:31.895
[SPEAKER_25]: I'm like going, eh?

55:31.915 --> 55:32.575
[SPEAKER_32]: I know.

55:32.816 --> 55:33.036
[SPEAKER_32]: I know.

55:33.196 --> 55:39.221
[SPEAKER_32]: And I tried playing it, and the steps were okay, considering they did the best they could with the song.

55:39.241 --> 55:43.645
[SPEAKER_32]: But I like playing DDR because this is one big thing that draws me to DDR.

55:44.025 --> 55:45.387
[SPEAKER_32]: It's like a big jukebox.

55:45.547 --> 55:47.028
[SPEAKER_32]: It's like the jukebox of now.

55:47.408 --> 55:52.773
[SPEAKER_32]: And having to play that song that sounds like it is a copy of a copy of a copy from 19-whatever...

55:54.334 --> 55:55.594
[SPEAKER_32]: I don't know.

55:55.715 --> 55:56.855
[SPEAKER_32]: I can't get into it.

55:56.975 --> 55:58.095
[SPEAKER_32]: I can't get into that song.

55:58.875 --> 56:02.656
[SPEAKER_32]: Here's another classic example.

56:04.717 --> 56:08.038
[SPEAKER_32]: I don't know how to describe it.

56:08.058 --> 56:10.178
[SPEAKER_32]: Here's another pic that was in the game.

56:10.638 --> 56:12.399
[SPEAKER_32]: And you tell me how I'm supposed to dance to this.

56:32.221 --> 56:33.301
Thank you for watching!

56:51.505 --> 56:52.866
[SPEAKER_32]: Thank you for watching!

57:07.015 --> 57:09.476
[SPEAKER_32]: Here's my problem with the song list, Konami.

57:10.116 --> 57:12.697
[SPEAKER_32]: If it ain't broke, don't fucking fix it!

57:13.038 --> 57:16.039
[SPEAKER_32]: And Ultramix 2 had the best song list.

57:16.099 --> 57:17.099
[SPEAKER_32]: It was incredible.

57:17.419 --> 57:18.620
[SPEAKER_32]: It was a great song list.

57:18.780 --> 57:24.282
[SPEAKER_32]: All these unknowns coming from a different drum, and great transplants and remixes like Gyruss.

57:24.682 --> 57:24.982
[SPEAKER_32]: Awesome.

57:25.422 --> 57:26.863
[SPEAKER_32]: Why did they break the four?

57:27.383 --> 57:28.944
[SPEAKER_32]: Why did they go and try to change it?

57:28.984 --> 57:39.268
[SPEAKER_32]: Why were they suddenly like, oh, let's be as eclectic as we possibly can be and let's throw in The Clash for no real good reason other than we want to pay homage to The Clash.

57:39.688 --> 57:40.108
[SPEAKER_32]: You know what?

57:40.168 --> 57:45.190
[SPEAKER_32]: Let's put in Ray Charles for no good reason other than we want to pay homage to Ray Charles.

57:47.591 --> 57:48.091
[SPEAKER_32]: I don't get it.

57:48.251 --> 57:49.711
[SPEAKER_32]: Something doesn't add up for me there.

57:50.212 --> 57:53.313
[SPEAKER_32]: Maybe I'm just a stuck up snobby asshole when it comes to my music, but

57:54.548 --> 57:57.570
[SPEAKER_32]: I played those songs once and I will probably not play them again.

57:57.871 --> 58:02.714
[SPEAKER_32]: Which is too bad because, you know, one thing, and going back into things I like about Ultramix 3,

58:03.757 --> 58:24.701
[SPEAKER_32]: The steps are great, and the steps were great in Ultramix 2, and as I understand that they made changes with who's doing the steps at Konami with the other mixes on into Ultramix 2, and it was a change for the better, because they got, you know, folks that were, from what we understand and what we're hearing, folks that were in the know on their DDR making the steps.

58:25.121 --> 58:32.023
[SPEAKER_32]: So, and they've kept that for Ultramix 3, so that's great too, because the steps are all really cool, and they do some new things with them too, which is kind of neat.

58:33.383 --> 58:39.568
[SPEAKER_32]: I was almost surprised, though, that they didn't try to get steps running backward yet, because that's the only thing we haven't seen in DDR yet.

58:39.628 --> 58:43.311
[SPEAKER_32]: And in that Hey Mama song, there's a part where it totally could have ran backwards.

58:43.351 --> 58:43.812
[SPEAKER_32]: It's awesome.

58:43.892 --> 58:44.172
[SPEAKER_32]: I don't know.

58:44.252 --> 58:45.473
[SPEAKER_32]: Anyway, just a weird thought.

58:45.653 --> 58:53.880
[SPEAKER_38]: Actually, the whole backwards thing was an idea we tried to pitch for Ultramix 2 with the Max 300 remix, where it kind of goes... Oh, yeah.

58:53.940 --> 58:56.222
[SPEAKER_38]: Yeah, because it sounds like it's being played backwards.

58:56.482 --> 58:59.124
[SPEAKER_38]: We were trying like hell to get the engineering to work, but...

58:59.989 --> 59:01.134
[SPEAKER_38]: It's Hawaii we expect.

59:01.656 --> 59:02.559
[SPEAKER_32]: We'll get on that later.

59:02.660 --> 59:03.162
[SPEAKER_32]: Yeah, you know what?

59:03.262 --> 59:04.547
[SPEAKER_32]: I noticed this attitude of...

59:05.769 --> 59:32.205
[SPEAKER_32]: WTF Hawaii and I'm all about showing Hawaii a little love after Ultramix 2 and I said on this show and I do not take it back that if Konami puts out another arcade mix Hawaii should be the one doing it however I would like to go back and amend my previous statement to say whoever did Ultramix 2 should be doing it because Ultramix 3 whoever was calling the shots with the song list I'm sorry I'm not feeling the love here I'm not feeling it and there's other big big problems with Ultramix 3 now

59:33.860 --> 59:38.384
[SPEAKER_32]: I'm not saying Ultramix 3 is a bad game, because it's a great game, and if you own an Xbox, you should be fucking buying this game.

59:38.424 --> 59:38.764
[SPEAKER_32]: You should.

59:39.224 --> 59:40.165
[SPEAKER_32]: There's no question about it.

59:40.505 --> 59:43.588
[SPEAKER_32]: But there are some problems that really make me go WTF.

59:43.668 --> 59:45.690
[SPEAKER_32]: Here is another huge-ass problem.

59:46.570 --> 59:51.734
[SPEAKER_32]: The song packs from Ultramix 2 are horribly off-sync.

59:52.795 --> 59:53.636
[SPEAKER_32]: Don't believe me?

59:54.957 --> 59:55.618
[SPEAKER_32]: Check this out.

59:56.718 --> 59:59.581
[SPEAKER_32]: I have proof that the songs are off-sync.

01:00:01.621 --> 01:00:05.543
[SPEAKER_32]: because there might be people out there that say, oh, Ram, you're just playing on your TV.

01:00:05.564 --> 01:00:06.584
[SPEAKER_32]: You just think they're off sync.

01:00:06.644 --> 01:00:08.665
[SPEAKER_32]: It feels like you're off sync because you're not hitting the buttons at the right time.

01:00:08.745 --> 01:00:09.886
[SPEAKER_32]: No, no, no.

01:00:10.346 --> 01:00:10.867
[SPEAKER_32]: I have proof.

01:00:11.187 --> 01:00:18.171
[SPEAKER_32]: What I did is I took the song into training mode and put it on with claps so you can hear exactly where the arrows fall in the song.

01:00:18.412 --> 01:00:18.932
[SPEAKER_32]: Listen to this.

01:00:42.793 --> 01:00:49.155
[SPEAKER_32]: Wait, hold on, I want you to listen to that part carefully again, because those notes are supposed to go with that when it comes at that do-do-do-do-do-do-do.

01:00:49.495 --> 01:00:54.797
[SPEAKER_32]: Listen, the claps start like almost a full second before it really happens.

01:00:54.897 --> 01:00:55.377
[SPEAKER_32]: Listen again.

01:01:01.759 --> 01:01:04.099
[SPEAKER_32]: Now, listen to this next part coming up with the freezes.

01:01:04.599 --> 01:01:06.020
[SPEAKER_32]: All the notes are on the upbeats.

01:01:06.060 --> 01:01:06.440
[SPEAKER_32]: Watch this.

01:01:16.058 --> 01:01:18.099
[SPEAKER_32]: Those steps are supposed to be on the sirens.

01:01:18.439 --> 01:01:19.139
[SPEAKER_32]: You get my picture?

01:01:19.419 --> 01:01:26.141
[SPEAKER_38]: Wow, I totally feel like I'm flashback to two years ago QAing Ultramix 1, where it was horribly long.

01:01:26.181 --> 01:01:30.362
[SPEAKER_32]: Well, apparently somebody forgot to QA the second song packs or something.

01:01:30.482 --> 01:01:30.842
[SPEAKER_32]: I don't know.

01:01:31.163 --> 01:01:35.784
[SPEAKER_32]: But now the community who paid five bucks for those songs, hoping that they get to play them on Ultramix 3, they're pissed!

01:01:36.581 --> 01:01:53.816
[SPEAKER_32]: They're pissed because they can't play those songs in Ultramix 3, they're ruined We were doing, we played, I was playing on live the other day with people, I don't know these people, they're just random people on live That song came up, we did like a random pick, I don't know, and that song came up and we played that on live And everybody was like, what the fuck, this song is fucked, what happened to this?

01:01:54.376 --> 01:02:03.324
[SPEAKER_38]: Babe, now you know why we have such a huge freaking timing window in Ultramix That was Disabled the Flaw, by the way, from Songpack 9, if you don't believe me

01:02:06.189 --> 01:02:33.406
[SPEAKER_32]: so there it is, audio proof that the damn thing is off sync and they should put out a patch, now the community is saying you gotta patch it, you gotta patch it, put out a patch I'm wondering if they can put out a patch, the game's probably not built to take a patch, I don't know because like Halo's different, when you go to Halo, Halo connects to the internet right away and if it sees the patch it gets it if DDR was not set up to do that, you're not going to be able to get a patch that easy so I don't know, I don't know what they're going to do, I doubt they're going to do anything

01:02:34.482 --> 01:02:35.383
[SPEAKER_31]: You can patch a game like that.

01:02:35.423 --> 01:02:39.045
[SPEAKER_31]: Just like they patched WWE WrestleMania 21.

01:02:39.105 --> 01:02:41.807
[SPEAKER_31]: They can do a patch on that.

01:02:43.688 --> 01:02:43.948
[SPEAKER_32]: Alright.

01:02:45.269 --> 01:02:45.629
[SPEAKER_32]: Here we go.

01:02:45.709 --> 01:02:46.770
[SPEAKER_32]: I want to play this as well.

01:02:46.790 --> 01:02:48.251
[SPEAKER_32]: This is the other thing that pisses me off.

01:02:48.291 --> 01:02:51.173
[SPEAKER_32]: And once again, I have audio proof that this pisses me off.

01:02:51.213 --> 01:02:52.394
[SPEAKER_32]: And you cannot dispute this.

01:02:53.795 --> 01:02:54.275
[SPEAKER_32]: You cannot.

01:02:56.156 --> 01:02:56.877
[SPEAKER_32]: Here's my beef.

01:02:58.271 --> 01:03:01.112
[SPEAKER_32]: Loading times in Ultramix series have been kind of iffy as it is.

01:03:02.412 --> 01:03:04.713
[SPEAKER_32]: Now I would like to show you what it's like to load the game.

01:03:04.773 --> 01:03:09.314
[SPEAKER_32]: Now I'm not even counting in the beginning, the game loads up, you get to the title screen.

01:03:09.954 --> 01:03:13.555
[SPEAKER_32]: What happens is that then there's a moment where it goes, loading songpacks.

01:03:14.015 --> 01:03:18.576
[SPEAKER_32]: And you have to wait, and you see these little bubble animations on the screen while it's loading your songpacks, which is okay.

01:03:19.614 --> 01:03:25.618
[SPEAKER_32]: makes sense, that's how, even though the songpacks are off sync and not worth loading anyway, this is how it, you know, brings them into the game.

01:03:25.879 --> 01:03:33.884
[SPEAKER_32]: However, I would like to play for you guys, this is a direct audio rip, I am not fudging anything here, this is a direct audio rip from earlier today, when I was booting up the game and playing.

01:03:34.205 --> 01:03:39.568
[SPEAKER_32]: So you're gonna hear the title music for just a minute, and then you're gonna hear a bloop bloop, that is the game starting to load, after I hit the A button.

01:03:39.789 --> 01:03:43.231
[SPEAKER_32]: And I'm not gonna shorten this or anything, this is seriously how long the load time is.

01:03:45.813 --> 01:03:48.475
[SPEAKER_32]: Okay, so here's a little tile screen, okay, and then here we go.

01:04:01.850 --> 01:04:04.252
[SPEAKER_37]: Goddammit, Rob, stop farting in the bathtub!

01:04:04.272 --> 01:04:18.204
[SPEAKER_32]: It's been about... let's see... 30 seconds.

01:04:23.949 --> 01:04:25.310
[SPEAKER_38]: I think I'll go get up and make a sandwich.

01:04:25.971 --> 01:04:28.653
[SPEAKER_38]: Little bit longer than William Hung's stardom.

01:04:40.952 --> 01:04:42.013
[SPEAKER_21]: That is a tasty burger.

01:04:43.194 --> 01:04:46.716
[SPEAKER_21]: I wonder if my game's gonna load any day now.

01:04:48.718 --> 01:04:51.640
[SPEAKER_32]: Wow, I'd really like to play some DDR today.

01:04:52.861 --> 01:04:53.061
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh!

01:04:53.121 --> 01:04:53.681
[SPEAKER_21]: There we go!

01:04:53.941 --> 01:04:54.482
[SPEAKER_21]: Finally!

01:04:54.782 --> 01:04:56.003
[SPEAKER_32]: The goddamn thing loaded!

01:04:56.083 --> 01:04:56.583
[SPEAKER_32]: Finally!

01:04:57.604 --> 01:04:59.185
[SPEAKER_32]: One minute, five seconds.

01:05:00.126 --> 01:05:04.729
[SPEAKER_32]: One whole minute for the goddamn songpacks to load and they don't even work!

01:05:07.845 --> 01:05:16.811
[SPEAKER_32]: Needless to say, if that's going to be the case, importing the songpacks probably should have been an option that you could choose to do before you go into the game.

01:05:17.332 --> 01:05:17.692
[SPEAKER_32]: I don't know.

01:05:18.012 --> 01:05:20.054
[SPEAKER_32]: Or maybe just optimize your thing a little better.

01:05:20.154 --> 01:05:20.474
[SPEAKER_32]: I don't know.

01:05:20.694 --> 01:05:22.375
[SPEAKER_27]: You know, they say that DDR is exercise.

01:05:22.395 --> 01:05:26.498
[SPEAKER_27]: This exercise would be screaming at the freaking console for it to load faster.

01:05:28.199 --> 01:05:29.480
[SPEAKER_19]: That is just crazy.

01:05:29.760 --> 01:05:31.422
[SPEAKER_19]: Exercise and patience.

01:05:31.642 --> 01:05:31.842
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah.

01:05:35.100 --> 01:05:36.381
[SPEAKER_19]: Welcome to DDR!

01:05:36.461 --> 01:05:38.261
[SPEAKER_19]: Now we're gonna exercise your patience!

01:05:39.842 --> 01:05:40.442
[SPEAKER_21]: Jesus.

01:05:45.625 --> 01:05:45.905
[SPEAKER_32]: Anyway.

01:05:46.225 --> 01:05:47.386
[SPEAKER_32]: I don't know what else to say about that.

01:05:47.446 --> 01:05:47.926
[SPEAKER_32]: Come on!

01:05:49.006 --> 01:05:49.287
[SPEAKER_32]: Alright.

01:05:49.607 --> 01:05:51.267
[SPEAKER_32]: So I'm dogging on the game a little bit.

01:05:51.908 --> 01:05:54.329
[SPEAKER_32]: All in all, though, it's not bad.

01:05:54.489 --> 01:05:57.270
[SPEAKER_32]: I just liked Ultramix 2 a little bit better.

01:05:57.850 --> 01:05:58.751
[SPEAKER_32]: Mel, what are your thoughts?

01:05:59.909 --> 01:06:02.970
[SPEAKER_38]: Well, I guess I liked it better because I was on Ultramix 2.

01:06:03.390 --> 01:06:03.810
[SPEAKER_38]: Who knows?

01:06:04.130 --> 01:06:05.431
[SPEAKER_38]: It's a curse, perhaps.

01:06:06.051 --> 01:06:18.195
[SPEAKER_38]: No, but just from, I guess, talking to people who are on the project and such, I think either Hawaii or RMC, spending a little too much time on things that were...

01:06:19.119 --> 01:06:24.683
[SPEAKER_38]: Not all that crucial, like, I heard quest mode got way too much more attention than it really needed to be.

01:06:25.524 --> 01:06:27.486
[SPEAKER_32]: Oh, god, I didn't even mention quest mode.

01:06:27.506 --> 01:06:34.912
[SPEAKER_32]: I mean, quest mode is... I mean, I guess it's cute, but the thing, the setup in EX2 was way better.

01:06:34.952 --> 01:06:37.774
[SPEAKER_32]: Whatever that thing was, I don't even remember what it was, mission mode or whatever, it was way better.

01:06:38.414 --> 01:06:39.996
[SPEAKER_32]: That's what I expected quest mode was gonna be.

01:06:40.496 --> 01:06:43.939
[SPEAKER_32]: I didn't realize quest mode was just, play a lot of DDR and get shit.

01:06:44.199 --> 01:06:45.460
[SPEAKER_32]: That's basically what quest mode is.

01:06:45.720 --> 01:07:04.318
[SPEAKER_38]: Yeah, and, like, there's so many bugs you can do to, like, gain more, you know, points or, you know, money or whatever, like, you can actually load your own edits into it, and, like, what they did was, they would do, like, all 16ths in, like, a circle pattern, so you just sit there and you rub the controller, boom, you know, so you jack up the, you know, points hardcore, um...

01:07:05.521 --> 01:07:10.709
[SPEAKER_38]: Other than that, I mean, like, song list, I think it's sort of like, it's kind of like the iPod shuffle theory.

01:07:10.749 --> 01:07:15.756
[SPEAKER_38]: They think, wow, if we can get it as broad as possible, we're going to look that much cooler, you know, but...

01:07:16.697 --> 01:07:19.740
[SPEAKER_32]: At the risk of alienating your fanbase that supported you through Ultramix 2.

01:07:20.180 --> 01:07:38.936
[SPEAKER_32]: Basically, I mean, you know, I know they want to be different, it's a good thing, you know, I mean, Ultramix, you know, has its own identity for the most part, but... Let's face it, we had to forgive Hawaii an awful lot for Ultramix 1, and then, you know, for Ultramix 2, it was like, okay, guys, okay, you proved yourselves with Ultramix 2, we're cool, we can be a happy family, just don't disappoint us again.

01:07:39.236 --> 01:07:42.119
[SPEAKER_32]: And then, pfft, song list was woo!

01:07:42.299 --> 01:07:44.581
[SPEAKER_27]: Is it gonna be like Madden, where every other year it's good?

01:07:45.106 --> 01:07:46.167
[SPEAKER_27]: and every other year it sucks.

01:07:46.207 --> 01:07:47.308
[SPEAKER_32]: It's like the Star Treks.

01:07:47.389 --> 01:07:48.730
[SPEAKER_32]: The even number ones are good.

01:07:51.373 --> 01:07:51.773
[SPEAKER_32]: We'll see.

01:07:52.734 --> 01:07:53.815
[SPEAKER_21]: Con!

01:07:54.556 --> 01:07:54.997
[SPEAKER_21]: Shut up.

01:07:55.417 --> 01:07:55.838
[SPEAKER_21]: All of you.

01:07:57.640 --> 01:07:58.941
[SPEAKER_32]: Stop ruining this station.

01:07:59.061 --> 01:07:59.361
[SPEAKER_32]: Alright.

01:07:59.862 --> 01:08:00.523
[SPEAKER_32]: Anything else, Mel?

01:08:01.143 --> 01:08:02.365
[SPEAKER_38]: I don't know.

01:08:02.405 --> 01:08:02.665
[SPEAKER_38]: I think

01:08:03.206 --> 01:08:06.249
[SPEAKER_38]: You know, like, did they just put a little too much into the game?

01:08:06.269 --> 01:08:09.151
[SPEAKER_38]: You know, just like, there's that whole dance, you know, freestyle mode and all that?

01:08:09.492 --> 01:08:15.577
[SPEAKER_38]: I think they could have done without, you know, most of it's like, spend more time on, you know, the actual gameplay stuff on the timing windows and all that.

01:08:15.617 --> 01:08:19.281
[SPEAKER_38]: I mean, granted, it's not as big as, like, Alaska now, you know.

01:08:19.561 --> 01:08:21.683
[SPEAKER_38]: It's not as big as Nevada, you know.

01:08:22.123 --> 01:08:27.068
[SPEAKER_32]: But, um... Well, I think maybe it's the kind of thing where they're like, well, they're not gonna notice it.

01:08:27.985 --> 01:08:28.705
[SPEAKER_32]: Whoops!

01:08:29.086 --> 01:08:31.727
[SPEAKER_32]: You forgot how rabid these DDR freaks can be.

01:08:31.827 --> 01:08:32.647
[SPEAKER_32]: Yes, we're going to notice.

01:08:32.907 --> 01:08:34.808
[SPEAKER_38]: Engineers don't notice it.

01:08:34.968 --> 01:08:36.509
[SPEAKER_38]: The QA people do.

01:08:36.949 --> 01:08:40.111
[SPEAKER_38]: The stuff they have on there, they know there's stuff.

01:08:40.151 --> 01:08:43.952
[SPEAKER_32]: I have a feeling that they knew some of this stuff was going on.

01:08:45.353 --> 01:08:46.193
[SPEAKER_32]: I don't know.

01:08:46.253 --> 01:08:48.234
[SPEAKER_32]: I can't speculate too much.

01:08:49.155 --> 01:08:51.816
[SPEAKER_38]: I don't know if it's just reticence or laziness or what.

01:08:51.916 --> 01:08:55.698
[SPEAKER_38]: I ain't going to say one way or another because I haven't nearly been close to the situation.

01:08:56.358 --> 01:08:56.618
[SPEAKER_38]: But

01:08:57.383 --> 01:09:02.107
[SPEAKER_38]: You know, overall, hey, you know, they figure DDR, it's Xbox, it has to sell.

01:09:03.048 --> 01:09:03.328
[SPEAKER_32]: I know.

01:09:03.768 --> 01:09:14.397
[SPEAKER_32]: I just hope when they do Ultramix 4 or Xbox 360 DDR, whatever's next for them, assuming there's going to be another mix, which there has to be, I can't see DDR dying just because the song list pissed me off.

01:09:15.038 --> 01:09:16.779
[SPEAKER_32]: I want there to be another mix.

01:09:17.039 --> 01:09:18.981
[SPEAKER_32]: The mix overall isn't bad.

01:09:19.101 --> 01:09:19.441
[SPEAKER_32]: It's not.

01:09:19.481 --> 01:09:20.442
[SPEAKER_32]: It's a good game, again.

01:09:20.462 --> 01:09:20.962
[SPEAKER_32]: I'm just saying that.

01:09:20.982 --> 01:09:22.844
[SPEAKER_32]: It's just these little things make me mad.

01:09:23.865 --> 01:09:26.427
[SPEAKER_32]: But when they do the future mix, I just, you know,

01:09:29.360 --> 01:09:31.642
[SPEAKER_32]: I hope they stick with the things that worked for them in Ultimix 2.

01:09:34.084 --> 01:09:34.684
[SPEAKER_32]: What else can I say?

01:09:34.724 --> 01:09:35.024
[SPEAKER_32]: I don't know.

01:09:35.604 --> 01:09:37.606
[SPEAKER_32]: I would like to see them shake up the interface a little more, too.

01:09:37.646 --> 01:09:43.229
[SPEAKER_32]: Ultimix 3 felt like Ultimix 2 Plus in a lot of ways, because they didn't really change the interface except the bubbles.

01:09:43.850 --> 01:09:51.275
[SPEAKER_32]: And I'm okay with the bubbles thing, but where the bubbles thing got awful was the little reflections of the bubbles blocked the graphics.

01:09:51.515 --> 01:09:56.138
[SPEAKER_32]: It's like, okay, somebody in the art department wasn't thinking that whole thing out or something.

01:09:56.158 --> 01:09:56.478
[SPEAKER_32]: I don't know.

01:09:57.042 --> 01:09:57.702
[SPEAKER_32]: So, whatever.

01:09:59.243 --> 01:09:59.744
[SPEAKER_32]: Anyway.

01:10:01.885 --> 01:10:03.326
[SPEAKER_32]: Any other comments from anybody on Ultramix 3?

01:10:04.367 --> 01:10:05.688
[SPEAKER_32]: You guys asleep over here?

01:10:05.948 --> 01:10:07.108
[SPEAKER_32]: Mario Kart over here, Loki?

01:10:07.129 --> 01:10:10.691
[SPEAKER_31]: Hey, I haven't played Ultramix 3, so I can't comment.

01:10:10.891 --> 01:10:15.274
[SPEAKER_31]: Other than that some of the music is really weird.

01:10:16.324 --> 01:10:23.890
[SPEAKER_25]: I almost want to, you know, say, oh, what the hell, I'll, you know, go ahead and get it because I have 1 and 2 sitting at home also.

01:10:23.930 --> 01:10:27.573
[SPEAKER_31]: Is the online mode any better than Extreme 2's online mode?

01:10:27.593 --> 01:10:28.774
[SPEAKER_32]: Oh, the online mode is incredible.

01:10:28.814 --> 01:10:29.834
[SPEAKER_32]: The online mode is great.

01:10:29.874 --> 01:10:31.015
[SPEAKER_32]: It's the best online VR yet.

01:10:31.035 --> 01:10:34.678
[SPEAKER_31]: Does it still have tournament mode in there where you can run a tournament on it?

01:10:34.878 --> 01:10:36.880
[SPEAKER_31]: I think so, but I'm going to be honest, I didn't really look.

01:10:39.061 --> 01:10:39.582
[SPEAKER_32]: Okay.

01:10:40.923 --> 01:10:41.143
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

01:10:42.214 --> 01:10:43.636
[SPEAKER_32]: We're going to go to another break, you guys.

01:10:43.676 --> 01:10:49.461
[SPEAKER_32]: When we come back from this break, you guys will have a chance to give your thoughts on Ultramix 3 and anything else that's on your mind.

01:10:49.501 --> 01:10:53.104
[SPEAKER_32]: I know we have some folks that want to talk about this MTV taping some of them went to on the East Coast.

01:10:53.404 --> 01:10:54.585
[SPEAKER_32]: They want to call in and talk about this.

01:10:54.986 --> 01:10:56.647
[SPEAKER_32]: Some other random stories you guys want to talk about.

01:10:56.767 --> 01:10:59.830
[SPEAKER_32]: It's your show when we come back from this break and we open up the sky blind.

01:10:59.870 --> 01:11:01.432
[SPEAKER_31]: Was it Orange Lounge goes to...

01:11:02.092 --> 01:11:03.293
[SPEAKER_32]: Orange Lounge Goes to the Movies

01:11:33.400 --> 01:11:34.241
Thank you for watching!

01:12:59.393 --> 01:13:00.395
Thanks for watching!

01:13:29.677 --> 01:13:31.599
Lyrics, Lyrics, Lyrics

01:14:58.743 --> 01:14:59.664
Thank you for watching!

01:17:09.398 --> 01:17:23.803
[SPEAKER_21]: All the life, all the life, all the life we're living I just wanna live Don't really care about the things that we say Don't really care about what others are saying I just wanna live

01:17:35.535 --> 01:17:36.655
Thanks for watching!

01:18:19.309 --> 01:18:23.192
[SPEAKER_32]: Orange Lounge Radio, Bomani Music, and more.

01:18:23.313 --> 01:18:23.633
[SPEAKER_00]: Perfect!

01:18:26.786 --> 01:18:43.416
[SPEAKER_32]: Hi kids, we're back here on Orange Lounge Radio, and in that break you heard some more music from the DDR Ultramix 3, including Conflict by the Azoic, Why by Neveraka, Rock Lobster by the B-52s, and I Just Wanna Live by Good Charlotte's on that mix.

01:18:43.476 --> 01:18:47.118
[SPEAKER_32]: So, you know, I was a little iffy with Good Charlotte being an Ultramix, but...

01:18:48.934 --> 01:18:49.515
[SPEAKER_32]: DDR Ultramix 3

01:19:17.964 --> 01:19:22.686
[SPEAKER_29]: Oh, as you know, I've always been a huge supporter of the Ultramix series.

01:19:22.726 --> 01:19:24.327
[SPEAKER_32]: Your volume just went down by half.

01:19:24.367 --> 01:19:25.788
[SPEAKER_32]: I don't know if you moved your microphone.

01:19:25.828 --> 01:19:26.248
[SPEAKER_32]: There we go.

01:19:27.489 --> 01:19:27.889
[SPEAKER_32]: Try it again.

01:19:29.530 --> 01:19:30.590
[SPEAKER_32]: Now we can't hear you at all.

01:19:31.911 --> 01:19:33.551
[SPEAKER_32]: I think... Is that better?

01:19:33.571 --> 01:19:33.972
[SPEAKER_32]: There we go.

01:19:33.992 --> 01:19:34.572
[SPEAKER_32]: Yes, much better.

01:19:34.672 --> 01:19:34.972
[SPEAKER_32]: What's up?

01:19:36.213 --> 01:19:43.016
[SPEAKER_29]: Okay, I've always been a huge supporter, but this mix kind of dropped the bomb in a lot of areas.

01:19:44.031 --> 01:19:45.311
[SPEAKER_29]: Come on and drop the bomb!

01:19:48.392 --> 01:19:49.132
[SPEAKER_32]: Alright, I'm kidding.

01:19:49.992 --> 01:19:51.012
[SPEAKER_32]: You know I couldn't resist.

01:19:51.753 --> 01:19:52.833
[SPEAKER_32]: Why did it drop the bomb?

01:19:53.793 --> 01:19:57.794
[SPEAKER_29]: Well, for one, they added a bunch of rock songs that we didn't need to hear.

01:19:59.174 --> 01:19:59.734
[SPEAKER_32]: I'll give you that.

01:20:00.254 --> 01:20:06.556
[SPEAKER_32]: I understand, like, NoFX and The Clash wanting to pay homage to them, but I don't think they really worked for DDR.

01:20:07.076 --> 01:20:08.616
[SPEAKER_32]: I didn't get that, but...

01:20:09.571 --> 01:20:14.195
[SPEAKER_29]: Yeah, but mostly I think the song pack thing is completely unforgivable.

01:20:14.535 --> 01:20:15.697
[SPEAKER_29]: I don't get that at all.

01:20:15.917 --> 01:20:18.099
[SPEAKER_32]: Did you hear the little audio clip I played earlier?

01:20:18.652 --> 01:20:25.194
[SPEAKER_29]: Yeah, and I've been playing, I've been trying to play songs, and a lot of them are songs I've loved, like Diamond Jealousy and R5.

01:20:25.815 --> 01:20:27.915
[SPEAKER_32]: And yeah, it's not just limited to like three songs.

01:20:27.976 --> 01:20:37.699
[SPEAKER_32]: I know Rini compiled some stuff and put it on the DDR Freak forum, and probably half the other forums out there on the internet, and it's got like Jack and Mark Get Busy and all these other songs.

01:20:37.719 --> 01:20:40.740
[SPEAKER_32]: I mean, it's like a list of like ten songs that are broken in the song packs.

01:20:40.900 --> 01:20:41.981
[SPEAKER_32]: It's sucky.

01:20:42.561 --> 01:20:43.321
[SPEAKER_32]: It's ridiculous.

01:20:43.741 --> 01:20:45.662
[SPEAKER_29]: It's completely unprofessional in my opinion.

01:20:45.882 --> 01:20:46.803
[SPEAKER_32]: Yeah, it sucks.

01:20:47.183 --> 01:20:47.543
[SPEAKER_32]: It sucks.

01:20:49.300 --> 01:20:50.180
[SPEAKER_32]: How did they miss that?

01:20:50.240 --> 01:20:50.901
[SPEAKER_32]: That's what I want to know.

01:20:50.941 --> 01:20:53.603
[SPEAKER_32]: It's like somebody didn't even test to see if the songpacks worked.

01:20:53.943 --> 01:20:54.303
[SPEAKER_32]: I don't know.

01:20:54.363 --> 01:20:55.104
[SPEAKER_32]: How do you miss that?

01:20:55.765 --> 01:20:56.285
[SPEAKER_29]: I don't know.

01:20:57.466 --> 01:20:58.967
[SPEAKER_32]: Or they knew about it and just didn't give a shit.

01:20:59.067 --> 01:20:59.387
[SPEAKER_32]: I don't know.

01:21:00.568 --> 01:21:01.369
[SPEAKER_29]: Something like that.

01:21:01.429 --> 01:21:01.869
[SPEAKER_29]: Who knows?

01:21:02.269 --> 01:21:02.650
[SPEAKER_32]: What else?

01:21:02.730 --> 01:21:04.211
[SPEAKER_32]: Any other thoughts you have on Ultimix 3?

01:21:05.592 --> 01:21:11.536
[SPEAKER_29]: A lot of things I like is a bunch of songs like So Many Times, which I absolutely love.

01:21:12.437 --> 01:21:15.219
[SPEAKER_32]: I think we have that queued for the next break, so we'll play that, definitely.

01:21:16.024 --> 01:21:19.246
[SPEAKER_29]: Yeah, the steps are really good this time.

01:21:19.886 --> 01:21:26.069
[SPEAKER_32]: The steps are all pretty good, especially when you consider that there are some songs where it's like, you know, this shouldn't even be in DDR.

01:21:26.770 --> 01:21:29.111
[SPEAKER_32]: The steps, they do the best they can, you know what I mean?

01:21:29.711 --> 01:21:37.956
[SPEAKER_29]: Yeah, like even the songs that aren't made for DDR, like Meowma and all that, they're just fun to play, so...

01:21:38.813 --> 01:21:45.194
[SPEAKER_32]: I, I, I just, whereas the steps are good, I'm not going to knock the steps because they do the best they can.

01:21:45.294 --> 01:21:48.755
[SPEAKER_32]: It's not fun to play because the song makes my ears want to, you know, scream out in pain.

01:21:49.115 --> 01:21:50.255
[SPEAKER_32]: I can't, I can't play it.

01:21:50.675 --> 01:21:50.895
[SPEAKER_32]: So.

01:21:50.915 --> 01:22:00.517
[SPEAKER_29]: Um, besides that, um, I'm kind of iffy about the online because it's a lot better this time.

01:22:01.197 --> 01:22:05.138
[SPEAKER_32]: I think the online is like the best part too, is like they really improved online support.

01:22:06.075 --> 01:22:13.440
[SPEAKER_29]: But the scoring is still a little iffy, because if you get a full combo, you instantly win, which is really annoying.

01:22:15.462 --> 01:22:23.307
[SPEAKER_29]: Because, you know, I've been through, like, multiple players already where they've gotten 50 greats and I've gotten 7, and I lose, and I'm like, what the fuck?!

01:22:24.028 --> 01:22:25.348
[SPEAKER_29]: Why, because you didn't get a full combo?

01:22:26.069 --> 01:22:30.132
[SPEAKER_29]: Yeah, I, like, got a miss because the controller for Xbox is completely CBR.

01:22:32.239 --> 01:22:41.627
[SPEAKER_32]: Yeah, I don't know if it's keeping track of my win-loss record appropriately, but I do like the fact that it shows on the little preview what your highest score is.

01:22:41.787 --> 01:22:44.670
[SPEAKER_32]: Because in my case, I have a triple-A, so my highest score is a perfect score.

01:22:44.910 --> 01:22:47.853
[SPEAKER_32]: And it shows how many triple-As and how many double-As you have, which I think is kind of cool.

01:22:47.893 --> 01:22:48.974
[SPEAKER_32]: That's kind of neat.

01:22:49.014 --> 01:22:49.614
[SPEAKER_29]: Yeah, I like that.

01:22:49.654 --> 01:22:50.095
[SPEAKER_32]: That's funny.

01:22:51.556 --> 01:22:52.016
[SPEAKER_29]: Okay.

01:22:52.136 --> 01:22:52.677
[SPEAKER_29]: Besides that.

01:22:53.057 --> 01:22:55.700
[SPEAKER_32]: Well, anything else you want to share about the mix, Jess, before I get to another call?

01:22:57.081 --> 01:22:57.381
[SPEAKER_32]: Instead.

01:22:57.708 --> 01:23:01.429
[SPEAKER_29]: Perfectly good to me, besides all the crap that's messed up.

01:23:01.910 --> 01:23:03.070
[SPEAKER_32]: Yeah, alright.

01:23:03.130 --> 01:23:04.290
[SPEAKER_32]: On a scale of 1 to 10?

01:23:07.091 --> 01:23:04.290
7.

01:23:07.512 --> 01:23:07.872
[SPEAKER_32]: Alright.

01:23:08.532 --> 01:23:09.172
[SPEAKER_32]: Take care, Jazz.

01:23:09.192 --> 01:23:09.832
[SPEAKER_32]: Thanks for calling in.

01:23:09.892 --> 01:23:10.833
[SPEAKER_32]: Have a good one, okay?

01:23:11.513 --> 01:23:12.233
[SPEAKER_32]: Have a nice day.

01:23:12.353 --> 01:23:12.754
[SPEAKER_32]: Later.

01:23:13.434 --> 01:23:13.714
[SPEAKER_32]: Bye.

01:23:14.134 --> 01:23:15.915
[SPEAKER_32]: Alright, let's go to another call.

01:23:16.055 --> 01:23:17.855
[SPEAKER_32]: We are getting hammered tonight, boys and girls.

01:23:17.895 --> 01:23:18.956
[SPEAKER_32]: We may not get to all the calls.

01:23:19.076 --> 01:23:20.917
[SPEAKER_32]: I'm really sorry, but we're going to try our best, okay?

01:23:21.477 --> 01:23:22.837
[SPEAKER_32]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

01:23:23.958 --> 01:23:25.278
[SPEAKER_41]: Hi, Sephiroth 1215 here.

01:23:25.418 --> 01:23:26.339
[SPEAKER_32]: Hi, Sephiroth 1215.

01:23:26.699 --> 01:23:27.379
[SPEAKER_32]: What's on your mind, buddy?

01:23:29.364 --> 01:23:30.065
[SPEAKER_41]: Just two things.

01:23:30.105 --> 01:23:36.407
[SPEAKER_41]: First of all, about Ultra Mix 3 really quickly, it's pretty good.

01:23:36.467 --> 01:23:42.130
[SPEAKER_41]: I mean, first of all, I say I do like The Clash a lot, so I appreciate that song a lot more.

01:23:42.590 --> 01:23:44.091
[SPEAKER_32]: But is it a good DDR song?

01:23:46.292 --> 01:23:47.232
[SPEAKER_41]: It seems kind of fit.

01:23:47.252 --> 01:23:48.032
[SPEAKER_41]: It's really catchy.

01:23:48.192 --> 01:23:48.613
[SPEAKER_41]: Alright.

01:23:48.873 --> 01:23:51.694
[SPEAKER_41]: I guess that's just where people have difference of opinion, but okay.

01:23:53.504 --> 01:24:21.637
[SPEAKER_32]: But otherwise, alright, they do have a lot of problems But the whole loading time thing, it's the same thing in the other Ultramix games It's just they don't have the loading screen Maybe that's what it is, it doesn't feel like it's so long in the other games Or maybe it's because there's not as many songpacks they're trying to import or something, I don't know Like I knew in Ultramix 2 it was kind of a little bit slow But, I don't know, you just didn't feel it, it wasn't a minute long It seems like it's really bad in this one, I don't know, maybe it's just me

01:24:23.601 --> 01:24:28.406
[SPEAKER_41]: Yeah, and quote from PoPanda21 is, she loves the bubbles.

01:24:30.188 --> 01:24:34.692
[SPEAKER_32]: The bubbles, I'm okay with the bubbles theme, but I just think it could have been better.

01:24:34.893 --> 01:24:37.095
[SPEAKER_32]: Like, it could have been executed better, the bubbles.

01:24:37.355 --> 01:24:39.638
[SPEAKER_32]: But anyway, this isn't about me, this is about your thoughts.

01:24:39.898 --> 01:24:40.398
[SPEAKER_32]: I'll shut up.

01:24:41.880 --> 01:24:42.280
[SPEAKER_41]: Alright, um...

01:24:43.646 --> 01:24:48.250
[SPEAKER_41]: But otherwise, I went to the MTV taping on Tuesday.

01:24:49.432 --> 01:24:50.152
[SPEAKER_41]: Now what was this for?

01:24:50.172 --> 01:24:51.233
[SPEAKER_41]: The MTV taping for what?

01:24:51.293 --> 01:24:52.795
[SPEAKER_32]: Gamesores or whatever it is they're doing?

01:24:53.636 --> 01:24:56.679
[SPEAKER_32]: Yeah, it's Gameores Week, which is pretty lame.

01:24:56.899 --> 01:24:57.580
[SPEAKER_32]: Gameores.

01:24:59.181 --> 01:25:00.562
[SPEAKER_32]: God bless MTV.

01:25:01.163 --> 01:25:02.284
[SPEAKER_32]: God bless them.

01:25:03.145 --> 01:25:03.826
[SPEAKER_32]: Alright, how was it?

01:25:03.866 --> 01:25:04.426
[SPEAKER_32]: What'd they do?

01:25:04.486 --> 01:25:06.708
[SPEAKER_32]: What can you expect on Gameores Week?

01:25:10.385 --> 01:25:11.966
[SPEAKER_41]: Honestly, really not much.

01:25:12.786 --> 01:25:15.308
[SPEAKER_41]: I mean, I was kind of psyched up at first.

01:25:15.528 --> 01:25:24.993
[SPEAKER_41]: I was waiting on line to get in, and I was in front of the line, so she's like, oh, you know, you first six or seven people, you come into the gaming room.

01:25:25.033 --> 01:25:27.554
[SPEAKER_41]: So I'm like, all right, gaming room is going to be awesome.

01:25:28.174 --> 01:25:29.955
[SPEAKER_41]: But then we get there.

01:25:30.475 --> 01:25:31.096
[SPEAKER_41]: It looks cool.

01:25:31.136 --> 01:25:32.456
[SPEAKER_41]: They have nice TVs and everything.

01:25:32.496 --> 01:25:33.037
[SPEAKER_41]: They have a 360 set up.

01:25:33.097 --> 01:25:33.657
[SPEAKER_41]: Like one 360?

01:25:34.758 --> 01:25:34.918
[SPEAKER_41]: Yeah.

01:25:37.779 --> 01:25:39.801
[SPEAKER_32]: I bet she doesn't even know what a 360 is.

01:25:39.821 --> 01:25:41.583
[SPEAKER_32]: It just matches her purse, that cunt.

01:25:41.603 --> 01:25:42.083
[SPEAKER_32]: Anyway, sorry.

01:25:42.103 --> 01:25:44.265
[SPEAKER_31]: It was a 360 with only one controller.

01:25:57.950 --> 01:26:00.392
[SPEAKER_32]: Well, again, didn't you hear about the shortage problems?

01:26:01.252 --> 01:26:02.993
[SPEAKER_32]: Now we're going to play a 32-player deathmatch.

01:26:03.194 --> 01:26:04.835
[SPEAKER_32]: Go!

01:26:05.915 --> 01:26:08.537
[SPEAKER_32]: It's like Mario Party 7, where it splits up the controller.

01:26:09.438 --> 01:26:19.104
[SPEAKER_32]: Okay, now, Sephiroth 1215, you get a button, and this guy over here, you get a button, and you get a button, and suddenly it's like the Oprah show, and you get a button, and you get a button, and you get a button!

01:26:20.565 --> 01:26:21.626
[SPEAKER_41]: Sorry, that was really random.

01:26:21.646 --> 01:26:21.946
[SPEAKER_41]: I'm sorry.

01:26:21.966 --> 01:26:22.266
[SPEAKER_41]: Go ahead.

01:26:23.887 --> 01:26:27.149
[SPEAKER_41]: It doesn't even matter, because the batteries die in the controller anyway.

01:26:31.468 --> 01:26:32.269
[SPEAKER_41]: Good game.

01:26:32.389 --> 01:26:33.330
[SPEAKER_41]: GG, MTV.

01:26:33.730 --> 01:26:34.190
[SPEAKER_41]: GG.

01:26:35.351 --> 01:26:44.216
[SPEAKER_41]: And they didn't do much, so they just gave a fake controller and just said, pretend to play to the person who was there.

01:26:46.397 --> 01:26:46.737
[SPEAKER_41]: Wow.

01:26:47.938 --> 01:26:50.280
[SPEAKER_41]: I was the one sitting there playing a stupid Frogger game.

01:26:51.440 --> 01:26:52.801
[SPEAKER_41]: You got to play the new Frogger game?

01:26:53.582 --> 01:26:54.262
[SPEAKER_41]: Yeah.

01:26:54.322 --> 01:26:55.102
[SPEAKER_41]: There's a Frogger game?

01:26:55.142 --> 01:26:55.423
[SPEAKER_41]: Is this on 360?

01:26:57.364 --> 01:26:58.865
[SPEAKER_41]: No, the original Xbox.

01:26:59.085 --> 01:26:59.165
[SPEAKER_32]: Oh.

01:27:00.552 --> 01:27:03.073
[SPEAKER_32]: Wait, what the hell is this thing all about?

01:27:03.113 --> 01:27:03.633
[SPEAKER_32]: It's not about the 360.

01:27:04.233 --> 01:27:05.374
[SPEAKER_32]: What is this show all about?

01:27:06.394 --> 01:27:09.935
[SPEAKER_41]: It's just trying to do something for gamers.

01:27:09.995 --> 01:27:10.455
[SPEAKER_41]: I don't know.

01:27:10.615 --> 01:27:17.658
[SPEAKER_31]: The question everyone wants to know is why is anyone playing Frogger Ancient Shadows?

01:27:17.678 --> 01:27:18.458
[SPEAKER_31]: That's what I want to know.

01:27:19.178 --> 01:27:21.379
[SPEAKER_38]: Yet another reason to hate Konami of Hawaii.

01:27:22.139 --> 01:27:23.120
[SPEAKER_38]: Did they do that game too?

01:27:23.140 --> 01:27:26.664
[SPEAKER_38]: Man, Hawaii lives off Frogger, dude, like nobody's business.

01:27:26.764 --> 01:27:27.625
[SPEAKER_32]: Dude, people buy it.

01:27:27.865 --> 01:27:28.325
[SPEAKER_32]: You know why?

01:27:28.365 --> 01:27:30.227
[SPEAKER_32]: Because it ends up in the $10 bin at Walmart.

01:27:30.327 --> 01:27:32.429
[SPEAKER_32]: And people go, oh, I'm going to get Frogger for my grandson.

01:27:32.870 --> 01:27:33.851
[SPEAKER_32]: I remember Frogger.

01:27:33.871 --> 01:27:34.872
[SPEAKER_19]: I remember Frogger.

01:27:35.713 --> 01:27:36.533
[SPEAKER_19]: That's a hip game.

01:27:36.554 --> 01:27:38.175
[SPEAKER_19]: That's a bee's knees, that game.

01:27:39.795 --> 01:27:40.335
[SPEAKER_32]: Anyway, sorry.

01:27:40.575 --> 01:27:42.796
[SPEAKER_32]: Was Frogger the bee's knees?

01:27:44.396 --> 01:27:47.677
[SPEAKER_41]: It was a pretty bad game, but whatever, I was stuck playing it.

01:27:49.557 --> 01:27:54.538
[SPEAKER_41]: The other games were like, I think Pac-Man World 3, and then Ultimate Spider-Man.

01:27:54.858 --> 01:27:57.319
[SPEAKER_31]: Oh, I'm glad they threw the Ultimate Spider-Man in there.

01:27:57.339 --> 01:27:59.299
[SPEAKER_31]: I was like, did they get confused?

01:27:59.339 --> 01:28:03.260
[SPEAKER_31]: Did they go off a list of what's hot 1980 or something?

01:28:05.820 --> 01:28:08.321
[SPEAKER_32]: Somebody tell MTV that they got Pac-Man fever.

01:28:09.267 --> 01:28:10.148
[SPEAKER_32]: Um, forget it.

01:28:10.649 --> 01:28:16.636
[SPEAKER_31]: Um, you know Rob, I actually, um, crap, I forgot to bring you a copy of Pac-World 3.

01:28:17.938 --> 01:28:18.819
[SPEAKER_32]: It's okay, it can wait.

01:28:19.199 --> 01:28:21.842
[SPEAKER_31]: I had four of them, two of them have been returned already.

01:28:22.663 --> 01:28:27.389
[SPEAKER_32]: You know, I actually was at Applebee's the other day and heard Pac-Man Fever on the radio and I was like, I thought this song died with it.

01:28:27.529 --> 01:28:28.731
[SPEAKER_32]: Oh wait, I'm sorry, we have a caller online.

01:28:30.601 --> 01:28:31.661
[SPEAKER_32]: Are we going to see you on TV?

01:28:32.801 --> 01:28:34.422
[SPEAKER_32]: Uh, yeah.

01:28:34.442 --> 01:28:36.262
[SPEAKER_32]: Did you flash the OLR gang sign?

01:28:38.423 --> 01:28:46.624
[SPEAKER_41]: No, unfortunately, you know, we couldn't really do much, first of all, but if you had an OLR shirt, I would definitely wear it.

01:28:46.784 --> 01:28:48.205
[SPEAKER_32]: I know, I keep hearing that.

01:28:48.325 --> 01:28:52.165
[SPEAKER_32]: If you only had the OLR shirt, we're working on it.

01:28:52.245 --> 01:28:55.386
[SPEAKER_32]: We need what's called, what do you call it, like a seed money.

01:28:55.766 --> 01:28:58.647
[SPEAKER_32]: We need money to buy the shirts, and then we can sell them.

01:28:58.727 --> 01:28:59.147
[SPEAKER_32]: So that's what...

01:29:00.607 --> 01:29:02.288
[SPEAKER_32]: We do have $25, that's true.

01:29:02.308 --> 01:29:02.728
[SPEAKER_32]: We won $25.

01:29:02.988 --> 01:29:05.930
[SPEAKER_32]: Anyway, anything else you want to say about the MTV taping?

01:29:07.310 --> 01:29:14.053
[SPEAKER_41]: Yeah, there was a brief second half where it was like the actual filming for the countdown they had.

01:29:15.094 --> 01:29:16.934
[SPEAKER_41]: We got free sports games.

01:29:18.135 --> 01:29:18.515
[SPEAKER_32]: Yay.

01:29:18.895 --> 01:29:21.276
[SPEAKER_32]: Yay, which in turn I bet you turned around and sold.

01:29:21.356 --> 01:29:25.738
[SPEAKER_31]: Did they give you like FIFA and like Top Spin or virtual tennis?

01:29:25.798 --> 01:29:27.559
[SPEAKER_31]: All those games that are huge in the U.S.,

01:29:29.205 --> 01:29:32.808
[SPEAKER_41]: Actually, we got NBA 06 and Madden 06.

01:29:33.468 --> 01:29:34.129
[SPEAKER_41]: I mean, 05.

01:29:35.490 --> 01:29:36.090
[SPEAKER_32]: Madden 05?

01:29:36.651 --> 01:29:38.632
[SPEAKER_32]: You got 05 games.

01:29:38.652 --> 01:29:41.975
[SPEAKER_32]: You're unloading the surplus on you guys before they bury them in New Mexico.

01:29:43.254 --> 01:29:45.115
[SPEAKER_41]: Oh, wait, wait, sorry, it is 06.

01:29:45.175 --> 01:29:45.916
[SPEAKER_41]: Oh, it is 06, okay.

01:29:45.996 --> 01:29:47.697
[SPEAKER_32]: I'm a bit behind on that.

01:29:48.218 --> 01:29:49.038
[SPEAKER_32]: It still sucks!

01:29:49.158 --> 01:29:50.539
[SPEAKER_32]: Madden's done!

01:29:50.760 --> 01:29:52.961
[SPEAKER_32]: I mean, give me Genesis Madden!

01:29:53.522 --> 01:29:55.183
[SPEAKER_32]: I'd have rather had Madden 05 than 06.

01:29:56.644 --> 01:29:56.904
[SPEAKER_41]: Anyway.

01:29:57.765 --> 01:30:01.367
[SPEAKER_41]: It's alright, though, because I took them, I went down to Walmart and got full credit for them.

01:30:01.467 --> 01:30:02.088
[SPEAKER_41]: There you go!

01:30:02.448 --> 01:30:03.909
[SPEAKER_32]: There you go, good man, good man.

01:30:04.389 --> 01:30:08.092
[SPEAKER_32]: Alright, we've got to let you go because we've got to get to other calls, but thank you for telling us what's going on.

01:30:08.392 --> 01:30:10.354
[SPEAKER_32]: Now, what are you wearing on the show so we can spot you?

01:30:11.478 --> 01:30:12.900
[SPEAKER_32]: I'm wearing a DDR Freak shirt.

01:30:13.460 --> 01:30:13.760
[SPEAKER_32]: All right.

01:30:14.081 --> 01:30:16.663
[SPEAKER_32]: Even though you're promoting the competition.

01:30:16.703 --> 01:30:17.124
[SPEAKER_32]: No, I'm kidding.

01:30:17.144 --> 01:30:17.904
[SPEAKER_32]: We love DDR Freak.

01:30:18.144 --> 01:30:18.645
[SPEAKER_21]: That's great.

01:30:19.025 --> 01:30:19.346
[SPEAKER_32]: All right.

01:30:20.126 --> 01:30:23.629
[SPEAKER_32]: By the way, the show is Direct Effect.

01:30:24.290 --> 01:30:24.891
[SPEAKER_32]: Direct Effect.

01:30:24.911 --> 01:30:25.952
[SPEAKER_41]: Tomorrow and Tuesday.

01:30:26.212 --> 01:30:27.013
[SPEAKER_41]: Tomorrow and Tuesday.

01:30:27.073 --> 01:30:27.493
[SPEAKER_41]: What time?

01:30:29.195 --> 01:30:29.555
[SPEAKER_41]: Over here.

01:30:29.595 --> 01:30:31.297
[SPEAKER_41]: I know it's on a thing at 7 maybe.

01:30:31.497 --> 01:30:31.797
[SPEAKER_41]: All right.

01:30:31.957 --> 01:30:33.979
[SPEAKER_41]: But either way, just look for Direct Effect.

01:30:34.250 --> 01:30:37.331
[SPEAKER_32]: I'll be sure to set my TiVo.

01:30:38.912 --> 01:30:39.512
[SPEAKER_32]: Take care, buddy.

01:30:39.552 --> 01:30:39.912
[SPEAKER_32]: Have a good one.

01:30:39.932 --> 01:30:40.372
[SPEAKER_32]: Thanks for calling.

01:30:40.852 --> 01:30:41.153
[SPEAKER_41]: You too.

01:30:41.173 --> 01:30:41.353
[SPEAKER_41]: Bye.

01:30:41.413 --> 01:30:41.573
[SPEAKER_32]: Later.

01:30:55.231 --> 01:30:58.053
[SPEAKER_03]: I gotta mute the Windows Media Player.

01:30:58.233 --> 01:30:58.453
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

01:30:58.493 --> 01:30:58.813
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't.

01:30:59.714 --> 01:31:00.014
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll wait.

01:31:00.094 --> 01:31:00.794
[SPEAKER_03]: You can put us on hold.

01:31:00.894 --> 01:31:01.335
[SPEAKER_32]: We'll wait.

01:31:02.455 --> 01:31:03.796
[SPEAKER_32]: Yeah, don't use Windows Media Player.

01:31:03.836 --> 01:31:04.256
[SPEAKER_32]: Jesus.

01:31:06.818 --> 01:31:07.078
[SPEAKER_32]: Anyway.

01:31:08.119 --> 01:31:08.959
[SPEAKER_32]: What's on your mind, buddy?

01:31:09.339 --> 01:31:10.380
[SPEAKER_32]: Who is this, first off?

01:31:10.760 --> 01:31:11.941
[SPEAKER_32]: This is Xander from Florida.

01:31:12.121 --> 01:31:13.362
[SPEAKER_32]: Hello, Xander from Florida.

01:31:14.102 --> 01:31:14.562
[SPEAKER_03]: What's on your mind?

01:31:17.684 --> 01:31:18.785
[SPEAKER_03]: Dang, this is driving me crazy.

01:31:19.945 --> 01:31:22.467
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, I wanted to bring up the Guitar Freaks.

01:31:23.769 --> 01:31:25.670
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, are we talking Guitar Freaks or Guitar Hero?

01:31:26.310 --> 01:31:27.151
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, Guitar Hero, sorry.

01:31:27.171 --> 01:31:28.151
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, what's up with Guitar Hero?

01:31:29.092 --> 01:31:46.121
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, actually, I was trying to figure out if I should save my money and go for Beatmania when it comes out, or... Well, here's the way we see it, is that Guitar Hero is out now and costs, what, 70 bucks, I think is how much Guitar Hero costs?

01:31:46.581 --> 01:31:46.881
[SPEAKER_32]: Right.

01:31:46.901 --> 01:31:51.924
[SPEAKER_32]: Beatmania is out, what, the last date we heard is February 8th, I think is what we heard for Beatmania?

01:31:51.944 --> 01:31:52.164
[SPEAKER_32]: February 8th.

01:31:52.921 --> 01:31:55.942
[SPEAKER_32]: February 10th to February 8th, sometime in early February is when that's coming out.

01:31:56.263 --> 01:31:59.924
[SPEAKER_32]: We don't know how much it's going to cost for sure, but let's say it's about the same, $70.

01:32:00.204 --> 01:32:01.645
[SPEAKER_32]: That would seem pretty reasonable, okay?

01:32:02.085 --> 01:32:05.747
[SPEAKER_32]: So the thing is, can you save $70 between now and February?

01:32:08.075 --> 01:32:08.936
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for watching!

01:32:26.337 --> 01:32:32.904
[SPEAKER_32]: It feels more like you're playing an actual guitar as opposed to holding something that looks like a guitar and pushing these buttons.

01:32:33.244 --> 01:32:35.827
[SPEAKER_32]: Really the five button thing really adds a lot to it.

01:32:36.027 --> 01:32:46.919
[SPEAKER_32]: And what they do is they do this thing with the fret buttons where you can actually push the fret buttons and it's hard for me to explain but you can push the buttons in order and get the different sounds.

01:32:47.359 --> 01:32:48.740
[SPEAKER_32]: which you couldn't do on Guitar Freaks.

01:32:48.760 --> 01:32:51.942
[SPEAKER_32]: You had to be holding the exact right button combinations or the damn thing didn't work.

01:32:52.562 --> 01:32:56.185
[SPEAKER_32]: And, you know, they did an awesome job in the art direction department.

01:32:56.225 --> 01:33:05.411
[SPEAKER_32]: Let's face it, Guitar Freaks was cool for about the first 75 mixes, but now that they're on, you know, whatever they're on, like Guitar Freaks, Super Duper, Second Mix, whatever they're on.

01:33:05.751 --> 01:33:06.131
[SPEAKER_32]: V2.

01:33:06.532 --> 01:33:07.252
[SPEAKER_32]: V2, thank you.

01:33:07.272 --> 01:33:08.193
[SPEAKER_32]: Okay, whatever the hell they're on.

01:33:08.573 --> 01:33:10.374
[SPEAKER_32]: It's the same damn game.

01:33:10.474 --> 01:33:11.675
[SPEAKER_32]: Nothing has been changed.

01:33:11.715 --> 01:33:13.036
[SPEAKER_32]: It's the same damn interface.

01:33:13.436 --> 01:33:16.418
[SPEAKER_32]: Even though they went up to PlayStation 2, it's the same game.

01:33:16.678 --> 01:33:18.800
[SPEAKER_32]: I don't watch the videos when I play the game!

01:33:28.661 --> 01:33:43.056
[SPEAKER_32]: If you like songs, if you like the J-pop, happy, go lucky, yeah, yeah, yeah songs, then Guitar Freaks is going to be the better game because Guitar Hero is filled with good old-fashioned American butt rock is what's in Guitar Hero.

01:33:43.536 --> 01:33:46.860
[SPEAKER_32]: And so if you like the butt rock, you're going to like this game.

01:33:46.880 --> 01:33:49.282
[SPEAKER_32]: When I say butt rock, I mean like, you know, Pantera.

01:33:49.302 --> 01:33:49.643
[SPEAKER_03]: If I don't...

01:33:50.243 --> 01:33:51.884
[SPEAKER_03]: If I don't like that kind of rock, then well...

01:34:20.804 --> 01:34:22.925
[SPEAKER_32]: So, I don't know.

01:34:22.965 --> 01:34:26.367
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just people saying wonderful things about the song list.

01:34:26.447 --> 01:34:29.089
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm like, well, you know, what if I don't like that style of music?

01:34:29.109 --> 01:34:30.350
[SPEAKER_32]: Then you're not going to like Guitar Hero.

01:34:30.810 --> 01:34:32.892
[SPEAKER_27]: And it's pretty easy to find the song list.

01:34:33.152 --> 01:34:35.914
[SPEAKER_27]: If you go to GuitarHeroGame.com, that's the website.

01:34:35.934 --> 01:34:38.936
[SPEAKER_27]: They've got a song list right on the website, so it's not hard to find it.

01:34:39.315 --> 01:34:58.991
[SPEAKER_32]: But if you are into the Japanese, like if you like trance and stuff, Beatmania, hell, Beatmania's, I don't, we don't know what songs for sure are going to be Beatmania, I mean, we know a few here and there, but rest assured, if it's like any of the other past, what, 1500 mixes they've had in Japan, you're going to have your happy trance and some J-pop, and if that's the kind of music you're into, Beatmania's worth that.

01:35:00.933 --> 01:35:01.193
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

01:35:01.433 --> 01:35:02.514
[SPEAKER_32]: Alright, have fun.

01:35:03.695 --> 01:35:04.616
[SPEAKER_32]: Yeah, you too.

01:35:04.696 --> 01:35:08.099
[SPEAKER_32]: Keep supporting them music games, because starving programmers need your money, okay?

01:35:10.410 --> 01:35:11.471
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, and Roxo's getting it.

01:35:11.971 --> 01:35:12.311
[SPEAKER_32]: All right.

01:35:12.832 --> 01:35:14.012
[SPEAKER_32]: Well, wait, no, no, no, no, no.

01:35:14.573 --> 01:35:15.954
[SPEAKER_32]: Oh, wait, Roxo, oh, for In the Groove?

01:35:16.574 --> 01:35:16.794
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

01:35:16.894 --> 01:35:18.155
[SPEAKER_32]: Oh, that's a whole nother thing, man.

01:35:18.175 --> 01:35:18.935
[SPEAKER_32]: That's a whole nother topic.

01:35:18.956 --> 01:35:19.196
[SPEAKER_32]: I know.

01:35:19.216 --> 01:35:20.657
[SPEAKER_03]: I brought it up like a month ago.

01:35:20.677 --> 01:35:20.857
[SPEAKER_32]: I know.

01:35:21.037 --> 01:35:22.898
[SPEAKER_32]: You think I remember each of these shows?

01:35:22.938 --> 01:35:24.759
[SPEAKER_32]: Please, with all the drugs I do, come on.

01:35:25.520 --> 01:35:25.920
[SPEAKER_32]: Just kidding.

01:35:25.940 --> 01:35:26.480
[SPEAKER_32]: Just kidding, kids.

01:35:26.500 --> 01:35:26.941
[SPEAKER_32]: Don't do drugs.

01:35:26.961 --> 01:35:28.842
[SPEAKER_32]: All right, we're going to let you go so we can get to another call, all right?

01:35:29.742 --> 01:35:29.963
[SPEAKER_32]: Okay.

01:35:29.983 --> 01:35:30.563
[SPEAKER_32]: All right, have a good one.

01:35:31.423 --> 01:35:31.684
[SPEAKER_32]: You too.

01:35:31.764 --> 01:35:31.944
[SPEAKER_32]: Later.

01:35:33.979 --> 01:35:34.559
[SPEAKER_32]: Rockstar sucks.

01:35:34.839 --> 01:35:35.220
[SPEAKER_32]: No, I'm kidding.

01:35:35.520 --> 01:35:37.360
[SPEAKER_32]: I just had to drop that.

01:35:37.420 --> 01:35:38.381
[SPEAKER_32]: No, I'm kidding, I'm kidding.

01:35:39.561 --> 01:35:41.222
[SPEAKER_32]: I just wanted to make somebody angry.

01:35:41.582 --> 01:35:46.464
[SPEAKER_32]: No, you know, in the groove is okay.

01:35:47.825 --> 01:35:49.845
[SPEAKER_32]: I'd like to mention I said nothing.

01:35:50.766 --> 01:35:51.566
[SPEAKER_32]: You were a good boy.

01:35:51.706 --> 01:35:52.607
[SPEAKER_32]: You were a very good boy, Loki.

01:35:52.647 --> 01:35:53.047
[SPEAKER_31]: No, no, no.

01:35:53.087 --> 01:35:54.027
[SPEAKER_32]: Keep playing Mario Kart.

01:35:54.067 --> 01:35:56.068
[SPEAKER_32]: It's keeping you quiet over there.

01:35:56.488 --> 01:35:59.669
[SPEAKER_31]: I've got almost all the races beat in 150cc.

01:36:01.631 --> 01:36:08.133
[SPEAKER_32]: I have to say, I'm strangely looking forward to In the Group 2 on a home console.

01:36:08.373 --> 01:36:13.094
[SPEAKER_32]: I think if they fix a lot of things, I don't know, it might be neat.

01:36:13.474 --> 01:36:13.854
[SPEAKER_32]: We'll see.

01:36:14.434 --> 01:36:15.914
[SPEAKER_31]: It'd be neat when they get sued.

01:36:16.014 --> 01:36:16.674
[SPEAKER_31]: Oh, stop it.

01:36:17.555 --> 01:36:18.275
[SPEAKER_32]: Let's go to another call.

01:36:19.115 --> 01:36:20.795
[SPEAKER_32]: Let's go to this one.

01:36:21.135 --> 01:36:22.076
[SPEAKER_32]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

01:36:23.476 --> 01:36:24.576
[SPEAKER_32]: Hey, Sky, speaking here.

01:36:24.856 --> 01:36:27.037
[SPEAKER_32]: Hello, oh, it's our resident 2DX whore.

01:36:27.077 --> 01:36:27.737
[SPEAKER_32]: How are you doing?

01:36:28.632 --> 01:36:29.813
[SPEAKER_32]: Don't you mean 2DX Bastard?

01:36:29.833 --> 01:36:30.173
[SPEAKER_32]: Oh, that's right.

01:36:30.193 --> 01:36:31.553
[SPEAKER_32]: You're a 2DX Bastard, not a whore.

01:36:31.574 --> 01:36:31.974
[SPEAKER_32]: I'm sorry.

01:36:33.374 --> 01:36:36.256
[SPEAKER_32]: Whores imply you're getting paid, which you're not.

01:36:36.536 --> 01:36:37.897
[SPEAKER_32]: You're actually spending a lot of money.

01:36:38.057 --> 01:36:40.338
[SPEAKER_32]: That makes you... I don't know what that makes you, but what's on your mind?

01:36:41.058 --> 01:36:45.821
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, as of last Tuesday, I finally got my copy of Beat Me 2DX 10th Style.

01:36:46.421 --> 01:36:47.221
[SPEAKER_25]: Yay!

01:36:47.862 --> 01:36:48.362
[SPEAKER_09]: How is it?

01:36:49.222 --> 01:36:50.503
[SPEAKER_09]: It's really great.

01:36:51.484 --> 01:36:57.747
[SPEAKER_09]: As a matter of fact, I would like to have my input on... I'd like to give my input on those 7 TS exclusives.

01:36:58.547 --> 01:37:00.287
[SPEAKER_09]: Go for it.

01:37:00.347 --> 01:37:05.348
[SPEAKER_09]: First up is Taito no Suika by Burme Inazawa featuring Shimotsuki Haruka.

01:37:06.028 --> 01:37:13.990
[SPEAKER_09]: The another I would give, you know, on a scale of level 1 to level 12, which level 12 is the most difficult, the another I would give it a level 10.

01:37:15.130 --> 01:37:15.430
[SPEAKER_20]: Okay.

01:37:16.930 --> 01:37:21.071
[SPEAKER_09]: Next up is, you know, Jelly Kiss Midian Smack Mix.

01:37:22.531 --> 01:37:24.672
[SPEAKER_09]: On 7Key, it stays as it is, it's level 7.

01:37:25.792 --> 01:37:27.995
[SPEAKER_09]: On the another, I would give it a level 10.

01:37:29.037 --> 01:37:29.677
[SPEAKER_32]: Pretty hard, huh?

01:37:30.258 --> 01:37:30.719
[SPEAKER_09]: Pretty hard.

01:37:32.461 --> 01:37:34.063
[SPEAKER_32]: I have to ask you, what do you think about that anyway?

01:37:34.083 --> 01:37:36.887
[SPEAKER_32]: Because you're pretty loyal to all the Japanese mixes that come out.

01:37:36.907 --> 01:37:40.652
[SPEAKER_32]: What do you think about that US song crossing over into Japan?

01:37:40.672 --> 01:37:41.373
[SPEAKER_32]: What do you think about that?

01:37:41.874 --> 01:37:43.334
[SPEAKER_09]: I was quite surprised, actually.

01:37:43.615 --> 01:37:44.615
[SPEAKER_32]: Yeah, I was surprised, too.

01:37:44.675 --> 01:37:51.317
[SPEAKER_32]: But we actually have an interview with MiniHead in this week's podcast, and it's pretty interesting because I kind of ask him right about this, too.

01:37:51.417 --> 01:37:53.478
[SPEAKER_32]: So you'll have to tune in to hear what he has to say.

01:37:53.578 --> 01:37:54.118
[SPEAKER_32]: So it's kind of neat.

01:37:54.338 --> 01:37:56.619
[SPEAKER_32]: Anyway, go ahead.

01:37:56.979 --> 01:37:57.379
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's see.

01:37:57.519 --> 01:37:58.219
[SPEAKER_09]: Hype the core?

01:37:58.239 --> 01:38:00.180
[SPEAKER_09]: On 7K, I would give it a level 9.

01:38:03.761 --> 01:38:06.382
[SPEAKER_09]: On the another, it should be a level 12.

01:38:06.602 --> 01:38:07.863
[SPEAKER_09]: It's really the hardest one.

01:38:09.163 --> 01:38:09.923
[SPEAKER_09]: Wow.

01:38:11.444 --> 01:38:15.145
[SPEAKER_09]: Exian, yeah, I did a Tatsujin video on that.

01:38:15.986 --> 01:38:19.667
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, what's really weird is it doesn't really look like a level 8.

01:38:20.888 --> 01:38:21.888
[SPEAKER_09]: I should really give it a level 7.

01:38:22.848 --> 01:38:23.128
[SPEAKER_32]: Really?

01:38:24.029 --> 01:38:24.269
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

01:38:24.729 --> 01:38:29.371
[SPEAKER_32]: I like hearing that, though, because that means it'll be a hard song I can beat.

01:38:29.691 --> 01:38:32.612
[SPEAKER_09]: And on the another, I give it a level 8, as it is.

01:38:35.142 --> 01:38:40.346
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, let's see, what else, uh, Satellite020712 from Coded Arms.

01:38:41.748 --> 01:38:47.052
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, it's level 8, it stays as it is, on 7 key, on the another, I give it a level 11.

01:38:47.092 --> 01:38:47.312
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

01:38:47.372 --> 01:38:50.615
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, you didn't know they had Coded Arms in there?

01:38:51.115 --> 01:38:52.236
[SPEAKER_31]: No, I didn't.

01:38:52.416 --> 01:38:53.277
[SPEAKER_31]: I turned off the mic.

01:38:53.317 --> 01:38:59.482
[SPEAKER_31]: I didn't realize they had that, no, what they needed was, um, I want to say it was Radar Rider, something like that, or, um.

01:39:01.274 --> 01:39:02.675
[SPEAKER_32]: They're crossing over from their other franchises.

01:39:02.795 --> 01:39:03.176
[SPEAKER_32]: Good stuff.

01:39:03.216 --> 01:39:05.598
[SPEAKER_32]: They had Rumble Roses music in Ultramix 3.

01:39:06.018 --> 01:39:06.378
[SPEAKER_32]: That's good.

01:39:06.638 --> 01:39:06.959
[SPEAKER_32]: Interesting.

01:39:07.019 --> 01:39:07.879
[SPEAKER_32]: Anyway, go ahead.

01:39:09.661 --> 01:39:16.986
[SPEAKER_09]: Let me check my tent style here and give my personal opinion on the 7 CS exclusives.

01:39:17.146 --> 01:39:19.468
[SPEAKER_09]: How many CS exclusives have I already mentioned so far?

01:39:19.488 --> 01:39:22.270
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know, Suica and Satellite 00712?

01:39:26.553 --> 01:39:29.775
[SPEAKER_09]: I think you're missing Strong Woman and... Strong Woman, oh yeah.

01:39:30.335 --> 01:39:33.137
[SPEAKER_09]: I give it, you know, on the another, I give it a level 8.

01:39:34.657 --> 01:39:34.958
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

01:39:35.898 --> 01:39:37.079
[SPEAKER_09]: Because of the chords.

01:39:37.639 --> 01:39:42.141
[SPEAKER_09]: Even though it's 95 BPM, which is really, really slow, I had a rough time.

01:39:42.422 --> 01:39:43.542
[SPEAKER_32]: Sounds a little bit like War Game.

01:39:44.823 --> 01:39:45.063
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

01:39:45.083 --> 01:39:45.463
[SPEAKER_09]: A little bit.

01:39:45.623 --> 01:39:45.823
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

01:39:45.843 --> 01:39:46.764
[SPEAKER_09]: A little bit.

01:39:47.144 --> 01:39:51.807
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think the last one, hmm, what was it again?

01:39:52.827 --> 01:39:54.068
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, Acid Vision, here we go.

01:39:54.088 --> 01:39:55.809
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, very, very good song.

01:39:56.654 --> 01:40:01.952
[SPEAKER_09]: level 8 stays as it is on 7 key and on the another I give it a level 10

01:40:02.894 --> 01:40:03.114
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright.

01:40:03.915 --> 01:40:05.595
[SPEAKER_09]: What are your thoughts about TenStyle overall?

01:40:06.536 --> 01:40:07.896
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, it's really, really good.

01:40:09.297 --> 01:40:16.060
[SPEAKER_09]: They just, you know, they just released, you know, they just put in a judge mode in which you can see how many perfect grades and greets that you have.

01:40:17.480 --> 01:40:17.960
[SPEAKER_09]: What else?

01:40:18.581 --> 01:40:24.863
[SPEAKER_09]: They have, you know, the DJ point, and yeah, Sakurina, one more lovely, Onage.

01:40:26.364 --> 01:40:26.744
[SPEAKER_32]: Alright.

01:40:28.245 --> 01:40:30.165
[SPEAKER_32]: Any other words for our listeners before we let you go?

01:40:30.185 --> 01:40:31.386
[SPEAKER_32]: We've got to get to another call, but...

01:40:32.281 --> 01:40:35.903
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I just want to say, go get TenStyle.

01:40:36.783 --> 01:40:37.103
[SPEAKER_32]: Alright.

01:40:38.324 --> 01:40:41.225
[SPEAKER_32]: I actually plan on getting it as soon as I get a new controller.

01:40:41.645 --> 01:40:42.405
[SPEAKER_32]: Which will be very soon.

01:40:42.685 --> 01:40:48.168
[SPEAKER_32]: Because I've heard the rumors that Konami's putting out a new one for the US, as I'm sure we all have, but we'll see.

01:40:48.248 --> 01:40:49.728
[SPEAKER_32]: And if it's true, I'm definitely getting one.

01:40:50.269 --> 01:40:50.589
[SPEAKER_32]: So we'll see.

01:40:51.519 --> 01:41:00.204
[SPEAKER_09]: Go watch my Tatsujin videos, Desolation Another, Don't Forget Another, and the Exe in 70 that I did.

01:41:00.444 --> 01:41:08.128
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll post it online, the site that has the Tatsujin videos that I have.

01:41:08.349 --> 01:41:09.549
[SPEAKER_32]: Absolutely, put a link in our chatroom.

01:41:10.950 --> 01:41:12.431
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, take care buddy.

01:41:13.251 --> 01:41:13.872
[SPEAKER_32]: Alright, later.

01:41:13.972 --> 01:41:14.152
[SPEAKER_32]: Later.

01:41:15.414 --> 01:41:21.299
[SPEAKER_32]: One more call, you guys, and we're getting hammered tonight, so if we don't get to your call, I'm really sorry, we're almost out of time.

01:41:21.799 --> 01:41:25.822
[SPEAKER_32]: We'll try to get more calls in a little later during the show, however, we're going to do one more.

01:41:26.383 --> 01:41:27.724
[SPEAKER_32]: Hello, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

01:41:30.306 --> 01:41:30.626
[SPEAKER_26]: Hi.

01:41:30.987 --> 01:41:31.807
[SPEAKER_32]: Hi, who's this?

01:41:33.028 --> 01:41:33.769
[SPEAKER_26]: This is Roz.

01:41:33.909 --> 01:41:35.130
[SPEAKER_32]: Hi, Roz, how are you?

01:41:40.294 --> 01:41:41.575
[SPEAKER_32]: That sounds a little iffy to me.

01:41:42.625 --> 01:41:45.387
[SPEAKER_26]: Yeah, I had an interesting weekend.

01:41:45.648 --> 01:41:46.729
[SPEAKER_32]: Okay, do tell.

01:41:46.769 --> 01:41:48.210
[SPEAKER_32]: What happened on your interesting weekend?

01:41:49.251 --> 01:41:55.356
[SPEAKER_26]: Okay, well, my dad has been in Mexico all week, and he just got back on Friday night.

01:41:55.676 --> 01:41:55.997
[SPEAKER_22]: Okay.

01:41:56.858 --> 01:42:03.423
[SPEAKER_26]: And as some of you may know, I was in a school play on Friday and Saturday evening.

01:42:03.804 --> 01:42:04.064
[SPEAKER_22]: Okay.

01:42:05.854 --> 01:42:09.315
[SPEAKER_26]: Well, he gets back Friday night after the play.

01:42:09.515 --> 01:42:10.375
[SPEAKER_26]: Missed the first night.

01:42:10.515 --> 01:42:12.396
[SPEAKER_26]: That's alright, after you beat the next night.

01:42:14.116 --> 01:42:17.898
[SPEAKER_26]: Uh, Saturday morning, I wake up.

01:42:18.358 --> 01:42:24.860
[SPEAKER_26]: I apparently had some kind of horrible allergic reaction to the makeup that they used on my face.

01:42:25.180 --> 01:42:26.000
[SPEAKER_32]: Oh no!

01:42:27.392 --> 01:42:31.953
[SPEAKER_26]: So I looked and felt sunburnt the whole day, and still do.

01:42:32.573 --> 01:42:39.014
[SPEAKER_32]: But that wasn't something that they found out before the play went, like you guys didn't do like a full-on dress rehearsal or anything, or?

01:42:39.934 --> 01:42:40.114
[SPEAKER_26]: No.

01:42:42.495 --> 01:42:46.635
[SPEAKER_26]: No, definitely, we didn't do a dress rehearsal, we just kind of went into it.

01:42:46.835 --> 01:42:48.796
[SPEAKER_32]: Oh no, okay.

01:42:49.096 --> 01:42:51.976
[SPEAKER_26]: So, yeah, I looked angry.

01:42:54.077 --> 01:42:56.217
[SPEAKER_32]: So did you end up doing the play on Saturday anyway?

01:42:57.768 --> 01:43:09.714
[SPEAKER_26]: Yeah, on Saturday, I left for the play, you know, went there, and the play actually went great, so that was good.

01:43:09.754 --> 01:43:15.136
[SPEAKER_26]: You know, my dad didn't go the second night because he was sick, and I didn't realize how sick he was.

01:43:15.156 --> 01:43:16.157
[SPEAKER_22]: Uh-oh.

01:43:16.957 --> 01:43:19.379
[SPEAKER_26]: Yeah, I'm going to say, I think he drank the water.

01:43:21.110 --> 01:43:22.573
[SPEAKER_32]: Oh no, in Mexico.

01:43:23.815 --> 01:43:32.772
[SPEAKER_26]: Yeah, so I was at the cast party, which was half-assed because there were only like four people at the party.

01:43:33.905 --> 01:43:39.267
[SPEAKER_26]: And we're talking, you know, we're talking about getting flowers from our parents, and I'm like, yeah, I didn't get any.

01:43:40.747 --> 01:43:47.569
[SPEAKER_26]: And my sister leads me off to the side, and she's like, here's why we didn't get you flowers.

01:43:48.469 --> 01:43:51.410
[SPEAKER_26]: Because we found Dad laying on the bathroom floor.

01:43:53.051 --> 01:43:58.052
[SPEAKER_32]: And... This is starting to sound more and more like an early FU of the week, in a way.

01:43:58.092 --> 01:44:01.493
[SPEAKER_32]: Like, this whole thing is just like, oh my gosh, I'd be so pissed.

01:44:02.799 --> 01:44:05.020
[SPEAKER_26]: Yeah, I was pretty pissed off about it.

01:44:05.920 --> 01:44:10.341
[SPEAKER_26]: I'm still pretty pissed off about it because he missed both nights because he was in Mexico.

01:44:12.361 --> 01:44:13.122
[SPEAKER_32]: Well, here you go.

01:44:13.542 --> 01:44:15.062
[SPEAKER_32]: You're in our chat room right now, right?

01:44:16.042 --> 01:44:16.242
[SPEAKER_26]: Yeah.

01:44:16.382 --> 01:44:17.283
[SPEAKER_32]: Okay, here's what I'm going to do.

01:44:17.303 --> 01:44:18.663
[SPEAKER_32]: I'm going to draw this on there.

01:44:19.123 --> 01:44:22.704
[SPEAKER_32]: I sent you a cyber flower there in the IRC room.

01:44:23.893 --> 01:44:24.053
[SPEAKER_26]: Aw.

01:44:24.433 --> 01:44:25.114
[SPEAKER_26]: So there you go.

01:44:25.174 --> 01:44:25.754
[SPEAKER_26]: We have you.

01:44:27.395 --> 01:44:27.775
[SPEAKER_32]: All right.

01:44:27.995 --> 01:44:29.196
[SPEAKER_26]: F you, PoePanda.

01:44:30.196 --> 01:44:30.916
[SPEAKER_26]: Shut the hell up.

01:44:31.197 --> 01:44:32.957
[SPEAKER_26]: I'm giving you the finger through my screen.

01:44:33.017 --> 01:44:34.538
[SPEAKER_32]: People are just mad because they didn't get through.

01:44:34.598 --> 01:44:35.158
[SPEAKER_32]: Don't listen to them.

01:44:35.519 --> 01:44:37.559
[SPEAKER_32]: We're going to take more calls later if we can.

01:44:37.620 --> 01:44:38.420
[SPEAKER_32]: People are just angsty.

01:44:38.740 --> 01:44:41.501
[SPEAKER_32]: Anyway, anything else you want to share, though, before we get on the next topic?

01:44:48.344 --> 01:44:49.005
[SPEAKER_26]: Good question.

01:44:51.877 --> 01:44:54.499
[SPEAKER_26]: I'm going to say probably not.

01:44:54.939 --> 01:44:55.259
[SPEAKER_32]: Alright.

01:44:55.399 --> 01:44:56.780
[SPEAKER_32]: Well, Roz, thanks so much for calling in.

01:44:56.820 --> 01:44:59.262
[SPEAKER_32]: I hope your week is better than your weekend was, okay?

01:44:59.722 --> 01:45:01.624
[SPEAKER_26]: Oh, and vote for my song on Cage Match.

01:45:01.884 --> 01:45:04.586
[SPEAKER_26]: Sakura said that she was using one of my songs.

01:45:04.886 --> 01:45:05.306
[SPEAKER_32]: Oh, really?

01:45:05.326 --> 01:45:06.407
[SPEAKER_26]: So vote for it, damn it.

01:45:06.627 --> 01:45:07.087
[SPEAKER_32]: Oh, really?

01:45:07.528 --> 01:45:07.888
[SPEAKER_32]: Alright.

01:45:08.068 --> 01:45:08.928
[SPEAKER_32]: Okay, well, we'll see.

01:45:09.049 --> 01:45:09.689
[SPEAKER_32]: We'll see how it goes.

01:45:10.249 --> 01:45:10.570
[SPEAKER_32]: Alright.

01:45:11.030 --> 01:45:11.410
[SPEAKER_26]: Take care.

01:45:12.031 --> 01:45:12.311
[SPEAKER_32]: Bye-bye.

01:45:14.268 --> 01:45:14.649
[SPEAKER_32]: All right.

01:45:14.709 --> 01:45:21.555
[SPEAKER_32]: Now, once again, we will open up the Skype line a little later, probably more towards the end of the show, because we want to bring DarkSakura back at some point as well.

01:45:22.375 --> 01:45:25.618
[SPEAKER_32]: But we're running behind on our other stuff and the stuff we've got to get to this week.

01:45:26.219 --> 01:45:32.424
[SPEAKER_32]: And, of course, you know it just wouldn't be a show if we didn't have ourselves a little bit of a cage match.

01:45:35.126 --> 01:45:35.467
[SPEAKER_32]: All right.

01:45:36.127 --> 01:45:36.327
[SPEAKER_32]: Now...

01:45:37.779 --> 01:45:41.242
[SPEAKER_32]: Since we weren't live last week, we didn't end up having a cage match last week.

01:45:42.303 --> 01:45:45.685
[SPEAKER_32]: So we have one that's actually a holdover from two weeks ago.

01:45:45.745 --> 01:45:48.548
[SPEAKER_32]: So technically it by default wins last week.

01:45:48.588 --> 01:45:50.449
[SPEAKER_32]: So it's going to be in its third week if it wins.

01:45:51.690 --> 01:45:53.292
[SPEAKER_32]: The song is by Depeche Mode.

01:45:53.792 --> 01:45:58.476
[SPEAKER_32]: And it's from their brand new album, which is called... I don't know what it's called.

01:45:58.496 --> 01:45:59.397
[SPEAKER_32]: I don't remember what it's called.

01:45:59.417 --> 01:46:00.477
[SPEAKER_32]: I think it's Playing the Angel.

01:46:02.479 --> 01:46:03.360
[SPEAKER_32]: The new Depeche Mode album.

01:46:03.380 --> 01:46:04.361
[SPEAKER_32]: I think it's called Playing the Angel.

01:46:04.401 --> 01:46:05.301
[SPEAKER_32]: Yes, it's called Playing the Angel.

01:46:05.842 --> 01:46:06.963
[SPEAKER_32]: The song is called Precious.

01:46:07.483 --> 01:46:08.483
[SPEAKER_32]: And it's our winner.

01:46:09.183 --> 01:46:13.224
[SPEAKER_32]: Remember the way the Cage Match works is that we play three songs for you guys.

01:46:13.244 --> 01:46:17.426
[SPEAKER_32]: We play a clip of the previous winner and two new songs in full for you guys.

01:46:17.706 --> 01:46:25.688
[SPEAKER_32]: You guys vote for your favorite in our chatroom at OrangeLoungeRadio.com and that winner goes into rotation all week long on Orange Lounge Radio's Video Game Music and More program.

01:46:26.088 --> 01:46:28.348
[SPEAKER_32]: Here it is, song number one tonight in the Cage Match.

01:46:28.408 --> 01:46:30.269
[SPEAKER_32]: A clip of Precious by Depeche Mode.

01:46:32.069 --> 01:46:35.110
[SPEAKER_21]: My God, what have we done to you?

01:46:41.218 --> 01:46:52.221
[SPEAKER_16]: We always tried to share The tenderest of care Now look what we have

01:47:10.826 --> 01:47:16.128
There was a little left to give Angels with silver wings Should have no suffering

01:47:40.660 --> 01:47:42.901
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you for watching!

01:48:12.518 --> 01:48:15.705
[SPEAKER_21]: I thought we'd vanish, but what left us

01:48:29.540 --> 01:48:33.222
[SPEAKER_32]: Okay, that was song number one in tonight's cage match, Depeche Mode with Precious.

01:48:33.242 --> 01:48:35.243
[SPEAKER_32]: Alright, we're going to get into song number two now.

01:48:35.283 --> 01:48:39.725
[SPEAKER_32]: This is actually DarkSakura's pick, and unfortunately she's unable to call us back right now and intro it herself.

01:48:40.105 --> 01:48:50.571
[SPEAKER_32]: But from what we understand, it sounds like Roz has something to do with this pick, so maybe she's doing that trick that I did last month when I had Miklatop pick one of my songs, and it went all the way to retirement.

01:48:50.931 --> 01:48:51.571
[SPEAKER_32]: So we'll see.

01:48:51.912 --> 01:48:53.612
[SPEAKER_32]: Will DarkSakura have the same luck?

01:48:53.652 --> 01:48:54.113
[SPEAKER_32]: We'll see.

01:48:54.453 --> 01:48:57.615
[SPEAKER_32]: Song number two is Tally Hall by Banana Man.

01:48:58.075 --> 01:48:58.355
[SPEAKER_32]: Enjoy.

01:49:05.504 --> 01:49:30.861
[SPEAKER_16]: Do you see Banana Man Hopping over on the white hot sand Here he come with some for me Freshly taken from Banana Tree Banana Man me want a ton Give me double and a bonus one Give me more for all me friends These banana flowin' never end

01:49:38.851 --> 01:49:40.813
[SPEAKER_16]: You want a banana?

01:49:41.834 --> 01:49:43.817
[SPEAKER_16]: This banana for you.

01:49:44.698 --> 01:49:47.781
[SPEAKER_16]: Tonight we dance around this flame.

01:49:48.622 --> 01:49:51.505
Then we get to play the spirit game.

01:49:51.625 --> 01:49:54.749
Spirit names we shout out loud.

01:49:55.249 --> 01:49:57.952
Shake the thunder from the spirit cloud.

01:49:58.493 --> 01:49:59.354
All this song burns.

01:50:03.736 --> 01:50:05.778
Thank you for watching!

01:50:29.444 --> 01:50:53.310
[SPEAKER_16]: Look you, you're too uptight, you know You could laugh and kick it back and go But without a rhythm or a rhyme You do not banana all the time Fly away from city on the run Try to make a little fun Look you, come to the bungalow I've heard that you tell me don't you so Don't you love me bumping up the drum Make a shake until the bum go down Let the bum go play until you drop This banana never

01:51:04.838 --> 01:51:06.319
[SPEAKER_15]: Fungale, Fungalo, make up your mind

01:51:39.921 --> 01:51:55.219
[SPEAKER_16]: Well it's nine o'clock and it's getting dark and the sun is falling from the sky I've never left so early and you may wonder why

01:52:09.116 --> 01:52:10.899
Thank you for watching!

01:52:32.198 --> 01:52:43.983
No banana make you go insane Looking back to busy town No banana make you want to frown Do you want a banana?

01:52:44.003 --> 01:52:46.504
Feel it now Do you want a banana?

01:52:46.524 --> 01:52:47.425
This banana for...

01:52:59.068 --> 01:52:59.229
[SPEAKER_21]: You...

01:53:25.526 --> 01:53:30.207
[SPEAKER_32]: Song number two in tonight's cage match, Tally Howe with Banana Man.

01:53:30.247 --> 01:53:35.168
[SPEAKER_32]: Let's go around and see if that song is banana-rific or if it's just plain rotten.

01:53:36.129 --> 01:53:36.249
[SPEAKER_32]: Angel.

01:53:36.269 --> 01:53:38.989
[SPEAKER_25]: I don't know if it's the only one that started giggling when it started playing.

01:53:39.009 --> 01:53:39.430
[SPEAKER_25]: I was like, oh my god!

01:53:39.450 --> 01:53:40.890
[SPEAKER_32]: You're the only one that's seen the video, apparently.

01:53:41.130 --> 01:53:41.630
[SPEAKER_32]: Of course.

01:53:41.750 --> 01:53:42.190
[SPEAKER_32]: What'd you think?

01:53:42.670 --> 01:53:47.812
[SPEAKER_24]: Um... Yeah, it's kind of really great, you know, it's a music video.

01:53:47.872 --> 01:53:47.992
[SPEAKER_24]: Okay.

01:53:48.012 --> 01:53:48.912
[SPEAKER_24]: But, um...

01:53:50.149 --> 01:53:54.752
[SPEAKER_25]: I just don't think it's a 10 just because it's funny, but what the hell, I'll give it a 10.

01:53:54.892 --> 01:53:55.493
[SPEAKER_25]: Melody!

01:54:19.542 --> 01:54:22.903
[SPEAKER_21]: I, I, I just don't get it.

01:54:23.703 --> 01:54:27.703
[SPEAKER_25]: Okay, okay, I'll post the video in my live journal so everyone can get it.

01:54:27.923 --> 01:54:28.844
[SPEAKER_25]: Of course it doesn't!

01:54:30.104 --> 01:54:30.684
[SPEAKER_25]: For later!

01:54:31.784 --> 01:54:39.365
[SPEAKER_38]: I give it an F. Um, if Lince the Funny could say a thing, she would say, that banana was shit.

01:54:40.146 --> 01:54:41.266
[SPEAKER_38]: I give it a 1.

01:54:43.466 --> 01:54:48.207
[SPEAKER_31]: Loki, I'm sorry, but the cage match does not require video, so...

01:54:48.891 --> 01:54:52.575
[SPEAKER_31]: Based on the song alone, it sucked balls and it gets a 1.

01:54:52.615 --> 01:54:54.237
[SPEAKER_31]: Alright.

01:54:55.238 --> 01:54:58.361
[SPEAKER_32]: And DarkSakura is actually in chat right now.

01:54:58.401 --> 01:54:59.122
[SPEAKER_32]: She's yelling at me.

01:54:59.162 --> 01:55:00.043
[SPEAKER_32]: She gives it a score of 11T.

01:55:00.263 --> 01:55:02.706
[SPEAKER_32]: And it says, ba-na-na.

01:55:03.723 --> 01:55:06.303
[SPEAKER_32]: Unfortunately, 11T is not a number, therefore it's zero.

01:55:07.064 --> 01:55:07.484
[SPEAKER_32]: Stop.

01:55:08.944 --> 01:55:10.424
[SPEAKER_32]: Alright.

01:55:11.324 --> 01:55:11.985
[SPEAKER_32]: Moving on.

01:55:12.265 --> 01:55:14.325
[SPEAKER_32]: Song number three in tonight's cage match.

01:55:14.385 --> 01:55:16.125
[SPEAKER_32]: Loki, what the hell did you bring to the table today?

01:55:16.145 --> 01:55:21.826
[SPEAKER_31]: I don't even remember if I put this in the cage match or not, but this song sounds like a good song that would be for a guitar hero.

01:55:22.246 --> 01:55:23.147
[SPEAKER_31]: It's like a kick-ass song.

01:55:23.427 --> 01:55:29.588
[SPEAKER_31]: It features a guitarist by the name of John Sykes, who is also in Whitesnake and some other bands.

01:55:30.048 --> 01:55:30.568
[SPEAKER_31]: So, um...

01:55:31.277 --> 01:55:32.779
[SPEAKER_32]: This is actually a theme song to an anime.

01:55:32.959 --> 01:55:34.962
[SPEAKER_32]: White Snake sounds awesome to me.

01:55:35.062 --> 01:55:36.043
[SPEAKER_32]: So, it's badass.

01:55:36.284 --> 01:55:38.126
[SPEAKER_32]: John Sykes with Cautionary Warning.

01:55:39.107 --> 01:55:39.307
[SPEAKER_32]: Yes.

01:55:39.468 --> 01:55:39.888
[SPEAKER_32]: Here it is.

01:55:39.968 --> 01:55:40.389
[SPEAKER_32]: And short.

01:55:40.689 --> 01:55:41.350
[SPEAKER_32]: Enjoy, kids.

01:57:58.413 --> 01:57:59.393
Thank you for watching!

01:59:11.178 --> 01:59:14.679
[SPEAKER_32]: Song number three is John Sykes with Cautionary Warning.

01:59:14.739 --> 01:59:17.060
[SPEAKER_32]: Let's go around and see what everybody thought of that one.

01:59:17.640 --> 01:59:17.940
[SPEAKER_32]: Angel.

01:59:21.861 --> 01:59:22.342
[SPEAKER_25]: It was good.

01:59:22.362 --> 01:59:25.362
[SPEAKER_25]: Eight and a half.

01:59:26.983 --> 01:59:28.984
[SPEAKER_32]: It was no Whitesnake, that's for damn sure.

01:59:29.104 --> 01:59:29.444
[SPEAKER_32]: Five.

01:59:29.984 --> 01:59:30.364
[SPEAKER_32]: Melody.

01:59:31.124 --> 01:59:33.565
[SPEAKER_27]: That was freaking cool and now I want to go play Guitar Hero.

01:59:34.325 --> 01:59:35.386
[SPEAKER_27]: Nine.

01:59:36.206 --> 01:59:36.466
[SPEAKER_32]: Mel.

01:59:38.855 --> 01:59:40.736
[SPEAKER_38]: DarkSakura says you get an automatic zero for being rude earlier.

02:00:07.315 --> 02:00:08.416
[SPEAKER_32]: Don't pick crappy songs then.

02:00:09.237 --> 02:00:10.318
[SPEAKER_32]: Oh snap.

02:00:10.578 --> 02:00:11.158
[SPEAKER_32]: Oh snap.

02:00:12.019 --> 02:00:14.741
[SPEAKER_32]: I gave her song a higher score than I gave your song.

02:00:14.761 --> 02:00:15.983
[SPEAKER_32]: That was not white.

02:00:16.023 --> 02:00:21.327
[SPEAKER_32]: You misrepresented that song by making me think it would be like White Snake.

02:00:21.667 --> 02:00:23.009
[SPEAKER_32]: I said he was in White Snake.

02:00:23.069 --> 02:00:24.910
[SPEAKER_32]: I didn't say he was like White Snake.

02:00:24.930 --> 02:00:25.851
[SPEAKER_32]: Misrepresent.

02:00:25.951 --> 02:00:27.432
[SPEAKER_32]: I demand a free trial.

02:00:28.153 --> 02:00:28.433
[SPEAKER_32]: Alright.

02:00:29.714 --> 02:00:32.397
[SPEAKER_32]: Let's recap the three songs you can vote for tonight, shall we?

02:00:33.592 --> 02:00:40.994
[SPEAKER_32]: Let's start off with song number one that you can vote for tonight is Depeche Mode with Precious.

02:00:41.074 --> 02:00:43.314
[SPEAKER_32]: If I can find it in my list here.

02:00:44.995 --> 02:00:48.176
[SPEAKER_32]: That worries me that I cannot suddenly find Depeche Mode with Precious.

02:00:48.196 --> 02:00:48.696
[SPEAKER_32]: Here we go.

02:00:49.376 --> 02:00:49.836
[SPEAKER_32]: Let's try this again.

02:00:49.856 --> 02:00:51.536
[SPEAKER_32]: Song number one was Precious by Depeche Mode.

02:00:52.377 --> 02:00:54.537
[SPEAKER_21]: Let's start with Depeche Mode.

02:00:59.163 --> 02:01:12.279
[SPEAKER_32]: Alright, song number two you can vote for tonight is Tally Hall with Banana Man And song number three you can vote for tonight is John Sykes with Cautionary Warning

02:01:26.209 --> 02:01:28.750
[SPEAKER_32]: Alright kids, place, vote now.

02:01:28.851 --> 02:01:34.314
[SPEAKER_32]: Send a private message to Sky with your vote for song number one, song number two, or, if you're so inclined, song number three.

02:01:34.694 --> 02:01:35.274
[SPEAKER_32]: It's your choice.

02:01:35.494 --> 02:01:36.435
[SPEAKER_32]: Send a vote in right now.

02:01:36.495 --> 02:01:37.315
[SPEAKER_32]: Private message, Sky.

02:01:37.375 --> 02:01:37.655
[SPEAKER_32]: Do it!

02:01:39.336 --> 02:01:39.597
[SPEAKER_32]: Alright.

02:01:40.377 --> 02:01:42.658
[SPEAKER_32]: Meanwhile, let's go over to Loki real quick.

02:01:42.878 --> 02:01:45.360
[SPEAKER_31]: What is going on in the sim scene, if I dare ask?

02:01:45.680 --> 02:01:46.160
[SPEAKER_31]: A few things.

02:01:47.181 --> 02:01:54.245
[SPEAKER_31]: The first being really cool, and that would be PSP Revolution, and it's basically kind of a port of Step Mania for the PSP.

02:01:54.972 --> 02:01:57.093
[SPEAKER_31]: and you can play your sim files on that.

02:01:57.454 --> 02:02:04.198
[SPEAKER_31]: The only thing it doesn't support right now is modifiers, so that's not in there, but at least it plays and it works, and it's pretty fun.

02:02:04.538 --> 02:02:07.680
[SPEAKER_31]: But, you know, best you can do with Controller Controller Revolution, so.

02:02:09.101 --> 02:02:12.643
[SPEAKER_31]: You can actually download that, we have a link on our website to where you can download that.

02:02:13.043 --> 02:02:17.046
[SPEAKER_31]: It's pretty awesome, it actually comes with a couple sim file packs in there, so you can check out some songs.

02:02:18.307 --> 02:02:21.369
[SPEAKER_31]: But yeah, so far, not bad for a first release, and...

02:02:23.360 --> 02:02:24.501
[SPEAKER_31]: That's pretty much about it.

02:02:24.781 --> 02:02:25.742
[SPEAKER_31]: All the important stuff, at least.

02:02:46.944 --> 02:02:51.267
[SPEAKER_32]: We like to sometimes watch a movie together and comment on it for you guys.

02:02:51.688 --> 02:03:02.037
[SPEAKER_32]: And the movie we're going to be commenting on this week is a news article that was recently, or actually not really an article, a news broadcast that was recently on our local television station.

02:03:02.077 --> 02:03:10.445
[SPEAKER_32]: It was WB58, and it was Loki and DarkSakura lending their expert opinions on Guitar Hero.

02:03:10.965 --> 02:03:12.166
[SPEAKER_32]: So let's check this out, shall we?

02:03:12.186 --> 02:03:13.566
[SPEAKER_32]: I'm going to bring up this video in studio.

02:03:13.806 --> 02:03:18.969
[SPEAKER_32]: But of course, for those of you guys out there in internet radio land, you guys will get to hear the audio of this.

02:03:19.369 --> 02:03:21.330
[SPEAKER_32]: And we will interject as need be with comments.

02:03:23.199 --> 02:03:23.539
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

02:03:23.619 --> 02:03:24.700
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, a question I have for you.

02:03:24.740 --> 02:03:28.822
[SPEAKER_02]: Have you ever secretly dreamed of being a rock star, wailing on your electric guitar?

02:03:29.122 --> 02:03:30.403
[SPEAKER_02]: I dream of that every night.

02:03:31.803 --> 02:03:35.465
[SPEAKER_32]: Actually, there's nothing I love more than getting up on the bed and wailing like a rock star.

02:03:35.665 --> 02:03:36.446
[SPEAKER_32]: Sold out crowd.

02:03:36.926 --> 02:03:40.968
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, for most people, the closest they'll ever get to playing is an air guitar in their living room.

02:03:41.608 --> 02:03:44.891
[SPEAKER_02]: and a new video game called Guitar Hero just released today.

02:03:44.911 --> 02:03:46.492
[SPEAKER_02]: In other words, you can't afford this crap.

02:03:47.393 --> 02:03:50.856
[SPEAKER_02]: We're showing this to you because, you know, we're rich and famous.

02:03:51.016 --> 02:03:55.019
[SPEAKER_02]: It's designed to get wannabe rockers closer to the real stage experience.

02:03:55.619 --> 02:03:56.600
[SPEAKER_02]: Brian Hickey rocks on.

02:03:56.640 --> 02:03:58.702
[SPEAKER_02]: He asked the producers of the demo Guitar Hero.

02:03:59.505 --> 02:03:59.685
[SPEAKER_02]: Rock-On

02:04:29.805 --> 02:04:30.986
[SPEAKER_32]: The box office is sold out.

02:04:55.296 --> 02:05:00.219
[SPEAKER_28]: Your guitar is tuned, and you're about to play one of the greatest rock songs ever.

02:05:17.711 --> 02:05:21.935
[SPEAKER_31]: Just because I took time off in your work to come play this stupid game.

02:05:23.216 --> 02:05:23.997
[SPEAKER_31]: I thought you liked the game.

02:05:24.718 --> 02:05:25.919
[SPEAKER_32]: You give it a good score later.

02:05:26.319 --> 02:05:28.361
[SPEAKER_31]: Oh yeah, I give it a good score, but you know what?

02:05:28.381 --> 02:05:33.886
[SPEAKER_31]: I had to drive like a freaking half an hour during my lunch break to come play this game.

02:05:35.408 --> 02:05:35.828
[SPEAKER_31]: Whatever.

02:05:39.772 --> 02:05:42.835
[SPEAKER_28]: That's the idea behind Red Octane's new Guitar Hero.

02:05:44.184 --> 02:05:50.766
[SPEAKER_28]: What we say is rock music inspired this game, so having full-length songs is really important.

02:05:50.986 --> 02:05:56.108
[SPEAKER_28]: Game producer Jon Tam shows Jamie Devrend and Matt Whiteman, two avid gamers, how to play.

02:05:56.948 --> 02:05:59.709
[SPEAKER_28]: I didn't know how to play this before you showed me, dumbass.

02:06:00.169 --> 02:06:01.549
[SPEAKER_28]: I know, I know.

02:06:01.689 --> 02:06:03.170
[SPEAKER_28]: Strings, no chords to learn.

02:06:03.550 --> 02:06:10.172
[SPEAKER_28]: To create music, John presses colored fret buttons to match those on the screen while hitting the strum bar once for each note.

02:06:10.512 --> 02:06:11.012
[SPEAKER_28]: The goal?

02:06:11.452 --> 02:06:14.253
[SPEAKER_28]: Nail as many notes as you can to rack up the high score.

02:06:14.293 --> 02:06:15.313
[SPEAKER_32]: See, now that guy thought ahead.

02:06:15.353 --> 02:06:17.293
[SPEAKER_32]: He's wearing his Guitar Hero shirt on.

02:06:17.734 --> 02:06:18.874
[SPEAKER_32]: So, yeah, you're right.

02:06:18.894 --> 02:06:21.775
[SPEAKER_32]: We need to get Orange Lounge shirts for all these reasons, for all the media whoredom.

02:06:22.315 --> 02:06:24.335
[SPEAKER_32]: If I don't play anything, the guitar track doesn't play.

02:06:24.355 --> 02:06:30.317
[SPEAKER_32]: And if I hit this thing... Go figure that that would happen, that when you don't play anything, the guitar track won't play.

02:06:30.357 --> 02:06:31.217
[SPEAKER_32]: Go fig... I'm just...

02:06:31.604 --> 02:06:33.165
[SPEAKER_32]: I'm just giving this poor guy a hard time.

02:06:33.205 --> 02:06:37.927
[SPEAKER_31]: If you fuck up a lot, then you start doing the jig and then you walk off stage.

02:06:38.827 --> 02:06:40.288
[SPEAKER_31]: Look at these trashy noises.

02:06:40.748 --> 02:06:44.309
[SPEAKER_28]: Each guitar guru character has its own extroverted personality.

02:06:44.489 --> 02:06:49.652
[SPEAKER_28]: There's Pandora, Princess of Rock, and punk virtuoso Johnny Napalm, among others.

02:06:49.992 --> 02:06:52.313
[SPEAKER_35]: I love the remote, so I played I Wanna Be Sedated.

02:06:54.022 --> 02:06:55.502
[SPEAKER_32]: And I'm looking bored in the background.

02:06:55.562 --> 02:06:57.523
[SPEAKER_32]: Then she discovers the whammy bar.

02:07:23.416 --> 02:07:24.577
[SPEAKER_28]: The Whammy Bar, Whammy Bar!

02:07:25.978 --> 02:07:27.879
[SPEAKER_28]: And then she discovered my Whammy Bar.

02:07:30.320 --> 02:07:32.001
[SPEAKER_31]: I hate... The Whammy Bar is my favorite part.

02:07:32.282 --> 02:07:35.624
[SPEAKER_31]: I don't know why the hell I decided to be in these stupid news interviews.

02:07:36.224 --> 02:07:37.105
[SPEAKER_31]: They're really bad.

02:07:37.685 --> 02:07:42.888
[SPEAKER_32]: No, they're only bad when I bring them on the radio and start, you know, making fun of them.

02:07:42.948 --> 02:07:43.529
[SPEAKER_31]: It's embarrassing.

02:07:43.569 --> 02:07:45.130
[SPEAKER_32]: I tease because I love.

02:07:45.850 --> 02:07:47.311
[SPEAKER_32]: I tease because I love to make fun of you.

02:07:47.331 --> 02:07:48.312
[SPEAKER_32]: It does nothing for our station.

02:07:50.928 --> 02:07:54.490
[SPEAKER_34]: It's like gymnastics, you have to land that last note.

02:07:54.590 --> 02:07:58.651
[SPEAKER_32]: I love how Jamie's taking the guitar off as this guy's talking, like, get this fucking thing out of here.

02:07:58.711 --> 02:08:00.032
[SPEAKER_28]: No, I'm kidding.

02:08:00.072 --> 02:08:00.372
[SPEAKER_28]: Be gone.

02:08:00.752 --> 02:08:01.352
[SPEAKER_32]: This is funny.

02:08:01.912 --> 02:08:08.955
[SPEAKER_28]: To give you the experience of being on stage, this film takes you inside the different venues, from practice rooms and basements to sold-out stadiums.

02:08:09.215 --> 02:08:14.217
[SPEAKER_28]: And the fans react, jumping up and down when you rock the house or letting you know if you're playing stinks.

02:08:14.737 --> 02:08:17.218
[SPEAKER_32]: Extifer, wasn't this the same reporter you thought was cute?

02:08:19.258 --> 02:08:21.239
[SPEAKER_34]: Yeah, I still think he's cute.

02:08:21.339 --> 02:08:22.960
[SPEAKER_22]: Alright, slide that up.

02:08:23.180 --> 02:08:33.064
[SPEAKER_34]: You don't play well, they don't like you, they'll start leaving the venue and start booing you, and then eventually if you die, your whole band gives up and throws their hands up in frustration against you.

02:08:35.505 --> 02:08:43.669
[SPEAKER_32]: See, I don't understand that, because, you know, in the real world, Bailing keeps lasting on But Can They Sing, and yet... Never mind, nobody's gonna understand that joke.

02:08:46.084 --> 02:08:50.026
[SPEAKER_28]: Matt likes the fact that Guitar Hero offers different rock genres to explore.

02:08:50.126 --> 02:08:51.767
[SPEAKER_32]: By the way, that's my DDR pad in the background.

02:08:52.068 --> 02:08:53.848
[SPEAKER_32]: That's my cameo in the story.

02:08:54.629 --> 02:08:57.710
[SPEAKER_32]: That's my dance pad lying there unloved in the background.

02:08:59.151 --> 02:09:01.553
[SPEAKER_32]: I don't even know why my dance pad's there.

02:09:01.733 --> 02:09:03.333
[SPEAKER_32]: Red Octane?

02:09:03.494 --> 02:09:05.174
[SPEAKER_32]: Oh yeah, it's the old Red Octane pad though.

02:09:05.254 --> 02:09:08.856
[SPEAKER_28]: From classic rock and hard rock to modern, punk even blues.

02:09:09.477 --> 02:09:09.957
[SPEAKER_28]: Fun game.

02:09:10.515 --> 02:09:11.195
[SPEAKER_28]: Really fun game.

02:09:11.516 --> 02:09:18.559
[SPEAKER_28]: To kick his song into high gear, Matt tilts the guitar up, activating star power, which allows him to rack up even more points.

02:09:19.099 --> 02:09:20.040
[SPEAKER_31]: Really good party game.

02:09:20.120 --> 02:09:24.822
[SPEAKER_31]: I mean, especially, you know, get a bunch of friends together, just, you know, don't say it, smash up some music.

02:09:24.842 --> 02:09:26.002
[SPEAKER_31]: Don't say it, don't say it.

02:09:26.082 --> 02:09:26.543
[SPEAKER_31]: Really fun.

02:09:26.903 --> 02:09:29.444
[SPEAKER_31]: So how do these two gamers rate Guitar Hero?

02:09:29.744 --> 02:09:31.565
[SPEAKER_31]: I'd definitely say it's at least an 8 out of a 10.

02:09:32.185 --> 02:09:32.666
[SPEAKER_32]: And Jamie?

02:09:32.786 --> 02:09:36.968
[SPEAKER_32]: Now see, I could clip that and use that for some great... I'd definitely say it's at least an 8 out of 10.

02:09:38.868 --> 02:09:41.731
[SPEAKER_32]: So, Loki, how big is Skye's penis?

02:09:42.091 --> 02:09:44.133
[SPEAKER_32]: I'd definitely say it's at least an 8 out of 10.

02:09:47.075 --> 02:09:48.517
[SPEAKER_32]: There's so much I could do with this.

02:09:49.978 --> 02:09:50.618
[SPEAKER_35]: Oh, 11.

02:09:52.360 --> 02:09:55.763
[SPEAKER_32]: What's with Jamie and the 11s lately?

02:09:55.943 --> 02:09:57.424
[SPEAKER_31]: They said a scale of 1 to 10.

02:09:57.685 --> 02:10:01.328
[SPEAKER_31]: I was basically giving a ranking within the criteria that they asked.

02:10:01.608 --> 02:10:03.510
[SPEAKER_31]: And she had to go out of the criteria.

02:10:03.530 --> 02:10:04.170
[SPEAKER_31]: I don't know.

02:10:04.351 --> 02:10:05.572
[SPEAKER_31]: It was an 11 game for me.

02:10:05.652 --> 02:10:05.952
[SPEAKER_31]: Whatever.

02:10:06.829 --> 02:10:07.449
[SPEAKER_35]: I like the game.

02:10:07.469 --> 02:10:07.849
[SPEAKER_35]: I like the game.

02:10:07.909 --> 02:10:08.349
[SPEAKER_35]: It's cool.

02:10:08.369 --> 02:10:10.050
[SPEAKER_35]: It's just completely rocking out.

02:10:10.590 --> 02:10:12.751
[SPEAKER_35]: It feels like playing an actual guitar.

02:10:13.491 --> 02:10:16.311
[SPEAKER_28]: Yeah, they let her talk and they paraphrase me.

02:10:18.432 --> 02:10:20.552
[SPEAKER_28]: Brian Hickey, WB58 News at 10.

02:10:22.613 --> 02:10:26.414
[SPEAKER_32]: Well, maybe what she's saying is more intelligent as opposed to, it's so fun.

02:10:27.794 --> 02:10:31.315
[SPEAKER_32]: Oh, man, I just got the death stare.

02:10:31.535 --> 02:10:33.316
[SPEAKER_32]: This, by the way, will be the last episode on this video.

02:10:36.441 --> 02:10:39.784
[SPEAKER_32]: Anyway, let's see what the two goons on the TV have to say about this.

02:10:40.125 --> 02:10:41.486
[SPEAKER_26]: You've got to love playing that air guitar.

02:10:41.506 --> 02:10:43.188
[SPEAKER_02]: I would like to have that mohawk going on.

02:10:43.588 --> 02:10:45.430
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, Guitar Hero is designed to be played on PlayStation.

02:10:45.450 --> 02:10:46.951
[SPEAKER_32]: By the way, he was talking about his pubic hair right there.

02:10:46.971 --> 02:10:48.192
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd like to have that mohawk going on.

02:10:48.472 --> 02:10:49.453
[SPEAKER_02]: Two, and it cost about $70.

02:10:49.533 --> 02:10:50.734
[SPEAKER_02]: Stay with us.

02:10:50.775 --> 02:10:51.856
[SPEAKER_02]: More to come right after the break.

02:10:55.219 --> 02:11:02.045
[SPEAKER_31]: They did also, I want to add, they also did a story apparently about In The Groove and how people are losing weight on it.

02:11:04.249 --> 02:11:07.066
[SPEAKER_31]: To which I could basically go, so you're recycling news now?

02:11:10.722 --> 02:11:12.262
[SPEAKER_32]: I didn't see the In The Groove story.

02:11:12.282 --> 02:11:13.803
[SPEAKER_32]: Yeah, we weren't part of it, thank God.

02:11:13.963 --> 02:11:15.663
[SPEAKER_32]: So I didn't bother to tape it.

02:11:15.743 --> 02:11:17.423
[SPEAKER_31]: I would have laughed if they wanted me to play this game.

02:11:17.663 --> 02:11:18.764
[SPEAKER_31]: So what do you give In The Groove?

02:11:18.884 --> 02:11:28.465
[SPEAKER_32]: Well, in the original email, I thought that that was, because that's why I hyped it up like I did, is that you're never going to believe what Loki and DarkSakura are going to be doing on the news.

02:11:28.746 --> 02:11:33.866
[SPEAKER_32]: Because originally it was supposed to be for In The Groove and Guitar Hero, but I guess something got fixed.

02:11:33.907 --> 02:11:35.827
[SPEAKER_31]: Yeah, I would have been cut off TV for that.

02:11:35.967 --> 02:11:36.127
[SPEAKER_32]: Yeah.

02:11:37.034 --> 02:11:38.556
[SPEAKER_32]: Alright, anyway, we're going to go to another break.

02:11:38.896 --> 02:11:43.460
[SPEAKER_32]: One more break here of Ultramix 3 Music, and then we're going to come back and we're going to reveal the winner of tonight's cage match.

02:11:44.161 --> 02:11:48.506
[SPEAKER_32]: We will also get into the FUs of the week and do Extover's movie review.

02:11:48.566 --> 02:11:49.226
[SPEAKER_32]: We can't forget that.

02:11:49.647 --> 02:11:58.796
[SPEAKER_32]: So don't send your FUs just yet, though, because I haven't tallied cage match votes, but this is the last opportunity for you guys to get your stuff into the cage match and everything you want to vote for there.

02:11:59.216 --> 02:12:05.963
[SPEAKER_32]: Alright, we're going to go into this break, and in this break I think we're going to start it off with a brand new Naoki track from DDR Ultramix 3.

02:12:06.304 --> 02:12:08.666
[SPEAKER_32]: This is Naoki with Brilliant Red.

02:12:11.269 --> 02:12:11.590
Naoki

02:12:45.752 --> 02:12:54.461
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes, that you were so much more It's just the way that you move your body with mine Seems like we had no concept

02:13:15.010 --> 02:13:16.251
Thank you for watching!

02:14:08.777 --> 02:14:10.778
[SPEAKER_21]: Watch away what I know, it's an overrated

02:14:43.966 --> 02:14:45.048
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you for watching!

02:14:48.740 --> 02:15:14.221
[SPEAKER_21]: When you speak, when you shout, when you shout out, when you knock myself out, brainwashed I need a brainwash, cream that'll pass, I need to clutter off, thrown in the trash I need a brainwash, cause I'm a moon, cause I'm a psycho, devil's race I'm really gonna miss a maniac, I'm gonna find a way to put me in a room But there's a nickel pin that gives me 14, cause all I wanna do is sing to a national song But I like to sing in minor technology

02:15:16.078 --> 02:15:16.719
Thanks for watching!

02:15:41.269 --> 02:15:48.232
[SPEAKER_21]: And now I fell in love with you so many times, so many times

02:16:11.653 --> 02:16:13.758
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you for watching!

02:17:52.143 --> 02:17:53.294
[SPEAKER_17]: Your direction

02:18:28.130 --> 02:18:29.581
[SPEAKER_17]: Your direction

02:18:50.166 --> 02:18:53.329
[SPEAKER_32]: After this song, we'll be having a Let Them Move Marathon.

02:18:53.649 --> 02:18:55.711
[SPEAKER_21]: No!

02:18:55.911 --> 02:18:56.552
[SPEAKER_32]: Just kidding.

02:18:56.992 --> 02:18:58.033
[SPEAKER_32]: Orange Lounge Radio.

02:18:58.093 --> 02:18:59.695
[SPEAKER_32]: Crap-free Bobani Radio.

02:19:00.015 --> 02:19:01.937
[SPEAKER_32]: Welcome back, boys and girls, to Orange Lounge Radio.

02:19:02.818 --> 02:19:06.281
[SPEAKER_32]: I bet you kids are just dying to know who won tonight's cage match, aren't ya?

02:19:06.681 --> 02:19:07.762
[SPEAKER_32]: You're just dying to know.

02:19:07.782 --> 02:19:09.204
[SPEAKER_32]: You just want to know so badly.

02:19:09.584 --> 02:19:10.044
[SPEAKER_32]: Here it is.

02:19:10.225 --> 02:19:12.587
[SPEAKER_32]: The wiener of tonight's cage match tonight is...

02:19:14.369 --> 02:19:17.412
[SPEAKER_32]: John Sykes with Cautionary Warning.

02:19:18.894 --> 02:19:23.599
[SPEAKER_32]: Shoot, all of you.

02:19:23.659 --> 02:19:24.199
[SPEAKER_32]: Rock on.

02:19:24.640 --> 02:19:26.862
[SPEAKER_32]: By the way, check the LiveJournal community.

02:19:27.523 --> 02:19:35.751
[SPEAKER_32]: Dude, it took Socarina like five minutes to turn that into, just like I imagined, into a little picture with the guy doing the rock on song.

02:19:36.229 --> 02:19:38.770
[SPEAKER_27]: We could send a picture of us doing the rock on symbol from that.

02:19:39.071 --> 02:19:42.332
[SPEAKER_32]: We could send it to him, and he'd be all, he'd be all, what the fuck is this?

02:19:42.352 --> 02:19:44.273
[SPEAKER_32]: Because he wouldn't remember doing that, I mean.

02:19:45.474 --> 02:19:48.155
[SPEAKER_32]: It's your fan club, Mr. News Person.

02:19:50.697 --> 02:19:51.317
[SPEAKER_32]: Oh, shit.

02:19:51.377 --> 02:19:51.697
[SPEAKER_32]: All right.

02:19:54.559 --> 02:20:04.064
[SPEAKER_32]: All right, we're going to get into the FUs of the week, and first, in order for us to get into the FUs of the week, I have to have the music queued up, because that's an important part of having the FUs of the week.

02:20:05.385 --> 02:20:05.765
[SPEAKER_32]: Oh, you have a new...

02:20:06.505 --> 02:20:07.145
[SPEAKER_32]: Oh, that's right.

02:20:08.166 --> 02:20:09.326
[SPEAKER_32]: Loki has a new song finally.

02:20:09.647 --> 02:20:11.027
[SPEAKER_32]: You're getting rid of Monomena?

02:20:15.729 --> 02:20:16.810
[SPEAKER_32]: That makes me kind of sad.

02:20:17.230 --> 02:20:21.752
[SPEAKER_32]: That's right, I'll let Mel and Melody have Monomena then, since you're not going to be using it.

02:20:22.233 --> 02:20:26.154
[SPEAKER_32]: You were showing me your video iPod, which I'm so jealous that you have all the latest toys, but would you do this?

02:20:27.335 --> 02:20:31.037
[SPEAKER_27]: So I go and get a video iPod, and I'm like, oh my god, I have the new toy, I love this thing.

02:20:31.077 --> 02:20:32.838
[SPEAKER_27]: So what's the first freaking video I put on it?

02:20:32.938 --> 02:20:33.338
[SPEAKER_27]: Monomena.

02:20:40.291 --> 02:20:43.736
[SPEAKER_32]: Let's get into the FUs of the week, and DarkSakura is usually the one that starts us off.

02:20:43.776 --> 02:20:46.521
[SPEAKER_32]: However, I will be entering FUs on DarkSakura's behalf tonight.

02:20:46.581 --> 02:20:48.284
[SPEAKER_32]: So here we go in the FUs of the week.

02:20:59.172 --> 02:21:01.634
[SPEAKER_32]: DarkSakura, I'll be entering some FUs on DarkSakura's behalf.

02:21:03.055 --> 02:21:10.700
[SPEAKER_32]: First FU is to being sick, because I know she's been sick for like two weeks straight now, and also to bronchitis, which she has, which sucks.

02:21:11.241 --> 02:21:15.163
[SPEAKER_32]: And FU to pneumonia for scaring her, you know, thinking that she might have had pneumonia.

02:21:15.744 --> 02:21:23.089
[SPEAKER_32]: And I think she's very angsty that she didn't get out to do a lot of stuff this weekend that she wanted to do, so I'm sure she's very pissed off about that.

02:21:23.129 --> 02:21:25.570
[SPEAKER_32]: So an FU to being homebound, I guess we could call it.

02:21:26.071 --> 02:21:27.712
[SPEAKER_32]: And an FU to having to go to work tomorrow.

02:21:29.813 --> 02:21:36.095
[SPEAKER_32]: And I think that would about wrap up everything that DarkSakura would be ATS, at least as far as I know, for now.

02:21:36.155 --> 02:21:38.376
[SPEAKER_32]: Let's go into Loki's FUs.

02:21:39.157 --> 02:21:39.317
Okay.

02:21:49.366 --> 02:21:55.487
[SPEAKER_31]: First off, fuck you to Chevron Oil Stop for breaking my car.

02:21:56.347 --> 02:22:00.688
[SPEAKER_31]: Now my car is leaking coolant out, and I'm sure it's not supposed to be doing that.

02:22:01.148 --> 02:22:05.049
[SPEAKER_31]: Because I pour the coolant in, and it pours right out the bottom, so that's not very good.

02:22:05.389 --> 02:22:10.911
[SPEAKER_31]: However, it doesn't empty, so it just overheats, and I've got to take it to the dealership tomorrow, which requires me to take time off work.

02:22:11.731 --> 02:22:13.171
[SPEAKER_31]: It's just a pain in the ass.

02:22:13.786 --> 02:22:41.745
[SPEAKER_31]: so fuck that, and fuck you old Asian women drivers, because god damn it, you fucking suck, I'm sitting in the car watching you drive, and you suck so bad, you know, braking when there's like a car 50 feet in front of you, and like having your turn signal on, and switching lanes the wrong direction, and it's just a pain in the ass, and you just really, you know, are reinforcing the stereotypes, so fuck old Asian women drivers, and finally Rocko,

02:22:43.737 --> 02:22:44.197
[SPEAKER_32]: My turn.

02:22:49.178 --> 02:22:57.120
[SPEAKER_32]: I would like to give an F you to me being a workaholic recently and me being very lazy on the weekend and not having any time to correct the test because I'm too lazy.

02:22:57.820 --> 02:23:09.902
[SPEAKER_32]: An F you to the fact that it took me like an hour to get that set up earlier tonight to rip the Ultramix 3 songs directly from the Xbox and no one appreciates it because the song list is kind of whack.

02:23:11.629 --> 02:23:19.278
[SPEAKER_32]: and I just give, I don't know, an F you to the fact that I have to go back to work tomorrow but at least it's a short week and Thanksgiving's coming.

02:23:19.658 --> 02:23:21.961
[SPEAKER_32]: F you to Thanksgiving because it's a holiday I never really got.

02:23:22.141 --> 02:23:26.266
[SPEAKER_32]: I don't get Thanksgiving but maybe it's just my family because we're special in my family.

02:23:26.286 --> 02:23:27.767
[SPEAKER_32]: We don't really do that.

02:23:27.807 --> 02:23:29.269
[SPEAKER_31]: You should really call it for what it is.

02:23:29.389 --> 02:23:30.591
[SPEAKER_31]: Black Friday Eve.

02:23:32.683 --> 02:23:33.905
[SPEAKER_32]: Oh, for the shopping day, yeah.

02:23:34.385 --> 02:23:34.746
[SPEAKER_32]: Crazy.

02:23:35.347 --> 02:23:38.911
[SPEAKER_32]: Alright, let's go on to Melody.

02:23:38.991 --> 02:23:40.353
[SPEAKER_32]: We're going to do her FUs first.

02:23:40.573 --> 02:23:40.753
Yay!

02:23:40.773 --> 02:23:43.897
[SPEAKER_21]: I like my freaking theme song.

02:23:48.993 --> 02:23:57.920
[SPEAKER_27]: Okay, seriously, at work, there's this chick who knows the song and loves my video iPod as much as I do, and we'll yell across the office to each other, and the other one will reply.

02:23:57.960 --> 02:23:58.320
[SPEAKER_27]: It's great.

02:23:58.700 --> 02:24:09.369
[SPEAKER_27]: Anyway, F you to curbs, because they really hurt when you fall on them, and F you to my knee for hurting when I hit the curb.

02:24:10.890 --> 02:24:14.052
[SPEAKER_27]: F you to my shoes, which went out sooner than they were supposed to.

02:24:14.072 --> 02:24:16.574
[SPEAKER_27]: Dude, my shoes are supposed to last like 300 to 500 miles.

02:24:16.614 --> 02:24:17.174
[SPEAKER_27]: They only lasted 200.

02:24:18.266 --> 02:24:39.996
[SPEAKER_27]: which all my FUs seem to be walk related at the moment because that would be my life but um yeah oh FU to Sunday Drivers they had to encounter a lot of them today coming up here and they suck so other than that I'm pretty mellow right now so yeah I'm pretty simple all right Mr. Mel B

02:24:43.030 --> 02:24:51.575
[SPEAKER_38]: Oh gosh, um, I guess my first FU is to all the video game stores and Best Buys in my area, because Guitar Hero is sold out everywhere.

02:24:51.855 --> 02:24:56.757
[SPEAKER_38]: What really sucks is that the one Best Buy by my crib, I was asking the sales associate, you know, do you have this in stock?

02:24:57.258 --> 02:24:58.478
[SPEAKER_38]: And he goes, oh, we don't have it right now.

02:24:58.498 --> 02:25:00.079
[SPEAKER_38]: I'm like, can you check anyone's nearby?

02:25:00.099 --> 02:25:00.980
[SPEAKER_38]: He's like, okay.

02:25:01.400 --> 02:25:05.582
[SPEAKER_38]: And then there's like one that pops up over in South San Jose, it says like two on his screen.

02:25:05.896 --> 02:25:07.177
[SPEAKER_38]: He goes, uh, we're sold out ever.

02:25:07.197 --> 02:25:08.958
[SPEAKER_38]: I'm like, what about that San Jose over there?

02:25:09.178 --> 02:25:10.379
[SPEAKER_38]: Uh, two means we're sold out.

02:25:10.979 --> 02:25:12.280
[SPEAKER_38]: Like, then why is there a two?

02:25:13.201 --> 02:25:16.423
[SPEAKER_38]: Um, you can go there, I guess, but no, trust me, it's sold out.

02:25:16.763 --> 02:25:19.925
[SPEAKER_38]: I'm like, dude, I guess you don't like helping people or making a sale.

02:25:20.626 --> 02:25:24.348
[SPEAKER_38]: Uh, whatever the hell, you know, I hope you're just happy with the minimum wage or something.

02:25:24.889 --> 02:25:32.213
[SPEAKER_38]: But, um, other than that, um, I guess just Defeat and I have enough time to do so much stuff over the weekend, and, uh...

02:25:33.594 --> 02:25:37.159
[SPEAKER_38]: Yeah, FU for not having enough FUs to be entertaining.

02:25:37.559 --> 02:25:37.899
[SPEAKER_38]: Alright.

02:25:38.660 --> 02:25:40.282
[SPEAKER_32]: Alright, Angel, your FUs of the week.

02:25:41.063 --> 02:25:45.709
[SPEAKER_25]: I actually don't have any, but... Nothing?

02:25:46.948 --> 02:25:48.329
[SPEAKER_25]: Aw, no more ball pits!

02:25:49.310 --> 02:25:51.411
[SPEAKER_32]: Pair drop!

02:25:51.772 --> 02:25:53.193
[SPEAKER_25]: It's okay.

02:25:54.513 --> 02:25:59.797
[SPEAKER_25]: Well, I guess I could say a general F you, but then... Out with it!

02:25:59.997 --> 02:26:00.357
[SPEAKER_09]: Out with it!

02:26:00.838 --> 02:26:02.119
[SPEAKER_25]: Mel B might look at me funny.

02:26:03.379 --> 02:26:08.423
[SPEAKER_25]: They need more games to help people with visual impairment, isn't it?

02:26:09.824 --> 02:26:11.485
[SPEAKER_25]: So, um, yeah.

02:26:11.665 --> 02:26:15.327
[SPEAKER_25]: Cause, um, if it wasn't for certain World of Warcraft mods, I'd be in big trouble.

02:26:16.028 --> 02:26:16.928
[SPEAKER_25]: So, yeah.

02:26:17.529 --> 02:26:21.592
[SPEAKER_25]: At least World of Warcraft is moddable enough to be able to do something like that.

02:26:22.292 --> 02:26:26.595
[SPEAKER_25]: But, I beat all the other people that don't think about that before they release a game.

02:26:27.936 --> 02:26:28.616
[SPEAKER_32]: Fair enough.

02:26:28.636 --> 02:26:32.719
[SPEAKER_32]: Well, at least the computer has it down pretty good with the accessibility options and everything.

02:26:32.759 --> 02:26:33.039
[SPEAKER_25]: Yes.

02:26:34.160 --> 02:26:35.761
[SPEAKER_25]: This is why I'm a computer geek.

02:26:35.861 --> 02:26:37.002
[SPEAKER_25]: I can see things.

02:26:37.402 --> 02:26:37.802
[SPEAKER_25]: Yay.

02:26:39.321 --> 02:26:47.927
[SPEAKER_32]: Alright, now it's my understanding that DarkSakura was actually at her computer just now, and she wanted to try and call in and get the real FUs, so I'm gonna try and get her on the line here.

02:26:49.348 --> 02:26:54.912
[SPEAKER_32]: Let's make this really quiet here, let's see if we can get DarkSakura's FUs, and then we'll go to the chatroom FUs, of which I know you guys have plenty of FUs.

02:27:00.877 --> 02:27:03.899
[SPEAKER_21]: It's got that demon voice again, ah!

02:27:04.759 --> 02:27:05.380
[SPEAKER_32]: What, you there, Jamie?

02:27:08.410 --> 02:27:08.730
[SPEAKER_32]: Hello?

02:27:09.531 --> 02:27:12.152
[SPEAKER_32]: There we go, yes, now we're good.

02:27:12.772 --> 02:27:14.073
[SPEAKER_32]: Alright, great, yes, I can hear you now.

02:27:14.333 --> 02:27:15.413
[SPEAKER_32]: Are you ready to do your FUs?

02:27:19.075 --> 02:27:24.898
[SPEAKER_32]: That's weird, I only heard her for like five seconds there, something like, what's wrong?

02:27:25.438 --> 02:27:27.599
[SPEAKER_32]: Uh, you're, oh, shoot, did it just hang up?

02:27:29.730 --> 02:27:30.371
[SPEAKER_32]: It hung up!

02:27:30.531 --> 02:27:31.251
[SPEAKER_32]: No, no!

02:27:31.371 --> 02:27:32.532
[SPEAKER_32]: Okay, wait, she's calling us back.

02:27:32.652 --> 02:27:34.454
[SPEAKER_32]: Let me make sure all my other crap is closed.

02:27:34.474 --> 02:27:35.174
[SPEAKER_32]: I have nothing else going on.

02:27:35.214 --> 02:27:35.915
[SPEAKER_32]: Okay, let's try this again.

02:27:36.535 --> 02:27:38.757
[SPEAKER_32]: Let me try closing iTunes, because iTunes is a real memory hog.

02:27:38.817 --> 02:27:39.557
[SPEAKER_32]: That might be part of the problem.

02:27:39.577 --> 02:27:40.058
[SPEAKER_32]: Alright, here we go.

02:27:41.038 --> 02:27:41.419
[SPEAKER_32]: Yes?

02:27:42.800 --> 02:27:43.300
[SPEAKER_11]: Excuse me.

02:27:43.480 --> 02:27:44.661
[SPEAKER_32]: There we go, now you're there.

02:27:45.462 --> 02:27:47.143
[SPEAKER_11]: It's because I disconnected IRC.

02:27:47.263 --> 02:27:49.444
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a delay that IRC is causing.

02:27:50.225 --> 02:27:50.826
[SPEAKER_32]: Interesting.

02:27:50.846 --> 02:27:52.106
[SPEAKER_32]: Okay, well, are you ready to do your FUs?

02:27:52.146 --> 02:27:53.107
[SPEAKER_32]: I have your music already.

02:27:53.808 --> 02:27:54.808
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I'm pretty ready.

02:27:54.909 --> 02:27:55.349
[SPEAKER_32]: Alright, here we go.

02:27:59.631 --> 02:28:01.652
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm turning it down now.

02:28:01.672 --> 02:28:02.032
[SPEAKER_10]: There we go.

02:28:02.593 --> 02:28:03.133
[SPEAKER_11]: There we go.

02:28:04.033 --> 02:28:08.015
[SPEAKER_11]: My first SU goes toward having a pissed off and depressed husband.

02:28:09.916 --> 02:28:15.919
[SPEAKER_11]: My second SU goes to people who are pissed off at everyone who's able to get an Xbox 360 on launch date.

02:28:16.279 --> 02:28:19.801
[SPEAKER_11]: Just because you can't get one, bitch, don't mean you should be down with everybody else.

02:28:20.101 --> 02:28:20.542
[SPEAKER_11]: Hello?

02:28:24.744 --> 02:28:29.026
[SPEAKER_11]: The third one goes toward my pre-pneumonia.

02:28:30.675 --> 02:28:36.400
[SPEAKER_11]: and the fact that my antibiotics are just now starting to make me feel sicker.

02:28:37.721 --> 02:28:41.584
[SPEAKER_11]: And I can't really think of much of anything else.

02:28:41.644 --> 02:28:44.146
[SPEAKER_11]: Those are the major pressing items on my mind.

02:28:45.707 --> 02:28:46.167
[SPEAKER_32]: Alrighty.

02:28:46.327 --> 02:28:48.389
[SPEAKER_32]: Well, I'm glad we could get you back on for the FUs.

02:28:48.469 --> 02:28:52.192
[SPEAKER_32]: After all, it is your baby here on the program, the angst, so...

02:28:53.046 --> 02:28:54.987
[SPEAKER_11]: Of course, it's not FU's about me.

02:28:55.227 --> 02:28:58.308
[SPEAKER_32]: Alright, well, we're gonna let you go for now though, so we can get to chatroom FU's, okay?

02:28:58.829 --> 02:28:59.169
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay!

02:28:59.349 --> 02:28:59.849
[SPEAKER_32]: Alright, take care.

02:29:00.629 --> 02:29:00.870
[SPEAKER_11]: Bye.

02:29:01.050 --> 02:29:01.290
[SPEAKER_32]: Bye.

02:29:02.010 --> 02:29:05.472
[SPEAKER_32]: Okay, uh, let's get into chatroom FU's.

02:29:05.512 --> 02:29:07.233
[SPEAKER_32]: And god damn, there's a lot of you angst.

02:29:07.273 --> 02:29:09.113
[SPEAKER_32]: Look at all, look, every single one of these blinking.

02:29:09.534 --> 02:29:11.555
[SPEAKER_32]: Every single one of those things blinking right now is an FU, so.

02:29:14.016 --> 02:29:14.756
[SPEAKER_32]: Get a cup of cocoa.

02:29:14.776 --> 02:29:16.757
[SPEAKER_32]: This is gonna be like an Ultramix 3 loading screen.

02:29:19.810 --> 02:29:24.694
[SPEAKER_32]: Sakurina says F you to Konami for not having In My Dreams in any games other than Dance Maniac's first mix.

02:29:24.734 --> 02:29:28.998
[SPEAKER_32]: It's the best Dance Maniac song ever and you guys can't even bother putting it in anything but Dance Maniacs?

02:29:29.038 --> 02:29:29.458
[SPEAKER_32]: Fuck you!

02:29:30.119 --> 02:29:34.242
[SPEAKER_32]: Also F you to the stupid teacher who made me fail his class because he made an error and still won't correct it.

02:29:34.703 --> 02:29:38.946
[SPEAKER_32]: F you to the smoker bitch at the bus stop who never stops blowing her goddamn cigarette smoke my way.

02:29:39.286 --> 02:29:42.629
[SPEAKER_32]: And final F you, F you to the Xbox 360 for being an overrated piece of shit.

02:29:42.909 --> 02:29:45.271
[SPEAKER_32]: Thanks Microsoft for making a sucky demo kiosk.

02:29:45.872 --> 02:29:46.733
[SPEAKER_32]: That was from Sakurina.

02:29:47.816 --> 02:29:54.819
[SPEAKER_32]: Dark Knight would like to say, um, F you to having to get up at 5am to catch a bus to get to work now, and F you to being broke again.

02:29:57.900 --> 02:30:04.583
[SPEAKER_32]: Um, NintendoManiac64 says, F you to you guys not noticing that someone was playing Mario Kart DS about an hour ago.

02:30:04.963 --> 02:30:08.724
[SPEAKER_32]: No, I knew Loki's been playing Mario Kart DS all night, but I thought, I didn't think the mic was picking it up.

02:30:09.285 --> 02:30:12.086
[SPEAKER_32]: Uh, F you to you guys for not sharing your MKDS friend codes.

02:30:12.386 --> 02:30:14.747
[SPEAKER_32]: I'll give it out, just send me a private message on Orange Lounge.

02:30:14.807 --> 02:30:17.508
[SPEAKER_32]: I just don't want, like, the freaky other people on the internet to, to

02:30:17.819 --> 02:30:18.439
[SPEAKER_32]: DarkLionXVI says,

02:30:42.441 --> 02:30:46.103
[SPEAKER_32]: F you to Colin Cowherd of ESPN Radio for dissing the late Eddie Guerrero.

02:30:46.163 --> 02:30:46.984
[SPEAKER_32]: Oh, I heard about this.

02:30:47.444 --> 02:30:51.006
[SPEAKER_32]: You might have no interest in professional wrestling, but dissing the dead is unforgivable.

02:30:51.126 --> 02:30:53.287
[SPEAKER_32]: I hope you die and see what it's like to be dissed dead.

02:30:53.988 --> 02:30:54.768
[SPEAKER_32]: You know what?

02:30:54.988 --> 02:31:04.253
[SPEAKER_32]: I don't follow wrestling, so I didn't... But that's why I don't say anything about it, because I don't follow it, so I just, you know... Well, if it's any consolation, I'm 100% behind that F you.

02:31:04.293 --> 02:31:06.835
[SPEAKER_32]: Yeah, I understand it's a big deal, you know.

02:31:07.435 --> 02:31:09.156
[SPEAKER_32]: Don't fuck with wrestling fans, man.

02:31:09.176 --> 02:31:09.736
[SPEAKER_32]: There's some...

02:31:10.777 --> 02:31:12.178
[SPEAKER_32]: They will throw you to the mat.

02:31:12.218 --> 02:31:18.482
[SPEAKER_27]: Dude, one of the pro wrestling sites put up the ESPN comment line and email address and the wrestling fans crashed both.

02:31:18.622 --> 02:31:19.763
[SPEAKER_32]: Oh, I can imagine.

02:31:19.783 --> 02:31:24.846
[SPEAKER_32]: Ah, we don't do personal FUs.

02:31:25.366 --> 02:31:27.888
[SPEAKER_32]: FU to some people telling me to stop correcting at things.

02:31:28.669 --> 02:31:32.231
[SPEAKER_32]: Hey, they might be something little to you, but that's a big thing to me.

02:31:34.059 --> 02:31:39.504
[SPEAKER_32]: SSJ100 Matt says, F you to work screwing me over this week and making me miss my first Thanksgiving away from home.

[SPEAKER_32]: Popanda says, F you to my gimpy father for preventing me from getting Indian food.

02:31:54.616 --> 02:31:55.277
[SPEAKER_32]: Too spicy?

02:31:56.018 --> 02:31:56.318
[SPEAKER_32]: I don't know.

02:31:57.299 --> 02:32:02.343
[SPEAKER_32]: Illusion says, F you to being sick for two weeks straight and F you to having two, count them, two papers due this week.

02:32:03.630 --> 02:32:09.934
[SPEAKER_32]: MPQ says, F you to being completely unprepared for my Japanese test tomorrow, and F you to the Ultra K tarnishing the new arcade with 2DX.

02:32:10.374 --> 02:32:13.256

[SPEAKER_32]: Neo14789 says, F you to the creative Xbox 360 distribution strategy.

[SPEAKER_32]: Xander C would like to say, F you to being on the East Coast.

02:32:24.683 --> 02:32:26.644
[SPEAKER_32]: It's too damn late right now, like midnight.

02:32:27.824 --> 02:32:28.905
[SPEAKER_32]: Sorry, that's our bad.

02:32:29.425 --> 02:32:30.406
[SPEAKER_32]: Damn us being on the West Coast.

02:32:31.880 --> 02:32:34.026
[SPEAKER_32]: Misty says, F you to having to work Friday.

02:32:34.387 --> 02:32:36.714
[SPEAKER_32]: Nuff said and I don't care that I'm off for Thanksgiving itself.

02:32:36.794 --> 02:32:38.038
[SPEAKER_32]: And of course, fuck cage match.

02:32:38.218 --> 02:32:39.061

02:32:52.436 --> 02:32:54.457
[SPEAKER_32]: Thanks MTV for pipping my checking account.

02:32:54.857 --> 02:33:02.001
[SPEAKER_32]: F you to GameStop for having the gall of offering me $14 for my sealed copy of NBA Live 06, and 20% less of that if I wanted cash for it.

02:33:03.140 --> 02:33:06.002
[SPEAKER_32]: Roz would like to say F you to whatever my dad's deal was last night.

02:33:06.142 --> 02:33:09.204
[SPEAKER_32]: F you to the basketball team for constantly bitching about the people in the school play.

02:33:09.524 --> 02:33:11.625
[SPEAKER_32]: It's not our fault that the directors were bitches to you.

02:33:12.145 --> 02:33:14.306
[SPEAKER_32]: F you to my sensitive skin for being sensitive.

02:33:17.068 --> 02:33:20.150
[SPEAKER_32]: And BXJasonXB says F you to fanboys.

[SPEAKER_32]: Brilliant Red sucks.

02:33:21.350 --> 02:33:22.211
[SPEAKER_32]: It's not a good song.

02:33:22.251 --> 02:33:25.253
[SPEAKER_32]: Go listen to B-Rock U. I have to agree.

02:33:25.293 --> 02:33:26.033
[SPEAKER_32]: Brilliant Red sucks.

02:33:26.193 --> 02:33:28.995
[SPEAKER_32]: So you have at least my support in that, BXJasonXB.

[SPEAKER_32]: StepperRoss1215 says, F you to the Ultramix 3 problems and to the 360 hype, even though I'm still getting one at launch.

02:33:36.139 --> 02:33:38.160

02:33:38.621 --> 02:33:41.922
[SPEAKER_32]: And F you to the random Garth Brooks concert during the MTV taping.

02:33:43.963 --> 02:33:50.067
[SPEAKER_32]: That's like that time Loki and I tried to go to Hooters and there was a very random Audioslave concert in the middle of the street.

02:33:51.648 --> 02:33:53.249
[SPEAKER_32]: How many times does that happen to you?

02:33:53.329 --> 02:33:57.571
[SPEAKER_32]: That you have this just a random, oh hey look, Audioslave's doing a concert in the middle of the street.

02:33:58.075 --> 02:34:01.778
[SPEAKER_27]: In New York, they had U2 show up and do a concert on a flatbed truck.

02:34:01.798 --> 02:34:03.519
[SPEAKER_27]: That's how they did their All Because of You video.

02:34:04.039 --> 02:34:07.701
[SPEAKER_27]: And you see a bunch of people taking pictures with their cell phones and stuff.

02:34:07.721 --> 02:34:08.942
[SPEAKER_27]: They're all like, what the hell is U2?

02:34:09.963 --> 02:34:10.323
[SPEAKER_32]: All right.

02:34:11.764 --> 02:34:14.526
[SPEAKER_32]: Let's go ahead and get to another quick break.

02:34:14.706 --> 02:34:16.087
[SPEAKER_32]: You guys are going to be leaving now, right?

02:34:16.227 --> 02:34:16.487
[SPEAKER_27]: Yeah.

02:34:16.507 --> 02:34:16.627
[SPEAKER_27]: I know.

[SPEAKER_32]: You've got a long drive back.

02:34:17.608 --> 02:34:19.249
[SPEAKER_32]: Thank you for coming to the show, though, and hanging with us.

02:34:19.269 --> 02:34:19.849
[SPEAKER_32]: We appreciate it.

02:34:20.270 --> 02:34:21.030

[SPEAKER_27]: You guys are cool.

02:34:21.671 --> 02:34:22.051
[SPEAKER_27]: We like you.

02:34:22.911 --> 02:34:23.792
[SPEAKER_32]: We like you, too.

02:34:23.972 --> 02:34:24.973
[SPEAKER_32]: Final thoughts, kids?

02:34:25.013 --> 02:34:25.053
[SPEAKER_32]: Aw.

02:34:26.826 --> 02:34:28.107
[SPEAKER_32]: Melody?

02:34:28.347 --> 02:34:29.648
[SPEAKER_27]: I have to take time to think.

02:34:31.590 --> 02:34:32.510
[SPEAKER_38]: Well, gosh, man.

02:34:32.630 --> 02:34:33.051
[SPEAKER_38]: Ultramix 3.

02:34:33.431 --> 02:34:37.834
[SPEAKER_38]: Well, let's just hope Ultramix 4 about does this last bit.

02:34:38.435 --> 02:34:45.500
[SPEAKER_38]: Alright, that Guitar Hero rocks, and hopefully I'll come back next time with more goodies for the show.

02:34:45.768 --> 02:34:48.509
[SPEAKER_32]: I'd like to thank you very much for the Guitar Hero poster for the studio.

02:34:48.529 --> 02:34:49.029

[SPEAKER_32]: Awesome.

02:34:50.030 --> 02:34:54.372
[SPEAKER_32]: And then I can't say what the other thing is because it's a birthday present for somebody, but thanks for that too, for hooking up.

02:34:54.492 --> 02:35:00.634
[SPEAKER_38]: Okay, and I think, like I said, like I mentioned before, I'll have one for the, maybe for the masses if they're nice.

[SPEAKER_32]: Peace, you cool cats.

02:35:29.427 --> 02:35:34.508
[SPEAKER_32]: We had some requests, so I'm going to get to those requests because I'm a nice guy and I'm doing the requests.

02:35:34.548 --> 02:35:42.451
[SPEAKER_32]: So we're going to do just a couple of requests, then we're going to come back and yes, I will open up the Skype line one more time because some of you guys are bitching and moaning that you didn't get through

02:35:42.779 --> 02:35:44.483
[SPEAKER_32]: So we'll give you one more chance.

02:35:44.924 --> 02:35:46.086
[SPEAKER_32]: So we'll be back after this.

02:35:46.487 --> 02:35:50.415
[SPEAKER_32]: Started off with that Forsaid Dance Maniacs song in some of these FUs.

02:35:50.495 --> 02:35:50.856
[SPEAKER_32]: We'll be back.

02:41:04.156 --> 02:41:10.505
[SPEAKER_32]: Alright kids, so we're back here on Orange Lingerie, and as promised we will be opening the Skype line soon, but we have a couple things we need to get to first.

02:41:11.526 --> 02:41:21.600
[SPEAKER_32]: One of them being the one and only Extifer is here, and Extifer, you do your own show on this station, believe it or not, I don't know why we gave you a show, but you do have one, and when is it?

02:41:22.279 --> 02:41:23.340
[SPEAKER_37]: It's on Mondays.

02:41:23.800 --> 02:41:26.522
[SPEAKER_37]: It's on Mondays at 7 o'clock to 9.

02:41:27.763 --> 02:41:28.883
[SPEAKER_37]: Pretty random show.

02:41:29.243 --> 02:41:36.268
[SPEAKER_37]: We don't talk about video games all too much, but I pretty much open the show to talk about anything.

02:41:37.088 --> 02:41:39.490
[SPEAKER_37]: Mostly cock, ass, and fucking.

02:41:39.710 --> 02:41:41.773
[SPEAKER_32]: So it's like The View, but with a bunch of perverts.

02:41:41.953 --> 02:41:44.557
[SPEAKER_37]: Oh yeah, and I try to have guests on the show.

02:41:45.198 --> 02:41:50.445
[SPEAKER_37]: Last week, by the way, I gave everybody an assignment that nobody has emailed me over.

02:41:50.465 --> 02:41:51.266
[SPEAKER_32]: What is the assignment?

02:41:51.286 --> 02:41:55.753
[SPEAKER_37]: The assignment was to watch a sad movie and email me your thoughts on it.

02:41:56.865 --> 02:41:57.526
[SPEAKER_37]: Oh, and nobody's done it.

02:41:57.546 --> 02:42:00.369
[SPEAKER_37]: I told the whole chat room to do it, and they have not done it.

02:42:00.549 --> 02:42:01.910
[SPEAKER_37]: Well, then you better hurry up.

02:42:02.491 --> 02:42:05.594
[SPEAKER_37]: I'm going to beat all of your asses tomorrow on my show if you guys don't do that.

02:42:06.535 --> 02:42:07.356
[SPEAKER_32]: All right.

02:42:07.416 --> 02:42:09.338
[SPEAKER_32]: Public spanking from Esther.

02:42:09.398 --> 02:42:11.400
[SPEAKER_32]: Tuesday nights on this very station.

02:42:11.720 --> 02:42:13.341
[SPEAKER_32]: She's only every other week for right now.

02:42:13.442 --> 02:42:17.545
[SPEAKER_32]: I'm not sure if she's on or off this week because of her being sick.

02:42:17.606 --> 02:42:19.968
[SPEAKER_32]: I think it's an on week, but because she's sick, she might be off.

02:42:20.688 --> 02:42:24.249
[SPEAKER_32]: I don't know, but check out, pump up the volume with the one and only DarkSakura.

02:42:24.269 --> 02:42:26.510
[SPEAKER_32]: And of course, that's 7 o'clock Pacific Time.

02:42:26.990 --> 02:42:37.234
[SPEAKER_32]: And of course, if you want to always be in the know on when we're live and stuff, the best place to be is our LiveJournal community, www.livejournal.com slash users slash Orange Lounge.

02:42:37.714 --> 02:42:39.055
[SPEAKER_32]: I wonder if you know what it's about.

02:42:39.075 --> 02:42:39.135
[SPEAKER_32]: Hey!

02:43:09.414 --> 02:43:11.216
[SPEAKER_32]: Mr. Wonderful, what are you going to be reviewing today?

02:43:11.997 --> 02:43:13.979
[SPEAKER_32]: Oh, that's right, you're a big Harry Potter whore, aren't you?

02:43:14.199 --> 02:43:15.640
[SPEAKER_32]: I am a big Harry Potter whore.

02:43:15.660 --> 02:43:17.522
[SPEAKER_32]: So were you in line with all the 13-year-old girls?

02:43:17.602 --> 02:43:18.063
[SPEAKER_32]: I wasn't.

02:43:19.636 --> 02:43:26.597
[SPEAKER_37]: I just have to say that I had to work on Friday, so I didn't get to see it until Friday after work, after 5 o'clock.

02:43:28.178 --> 02:43:37.139
[SPEAKER_37]: We had tried to go to an earlier showing, but all the showings were sold out, so we had to go see the last showing, which was at 11.05.

02:43:37.239 --> 02:43:39.480
[SPEAKER_37]: Didn't the movie make like $11 billion this weekend?

02:43:39.760 --> 02:43:45.901
[SPEAKER_37]: You know, it's interesting because their expectations for this film were that it was going to make less,

02:43:46.696 --> 02:43:47.036
[SPEAKER_37]: and so on.

02:44:13.556 --> 02:44:22.384
[SPEAKER_37]: Of the four movies that are the best openings ever, Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire is the only one that is a winner movie.

02:44:23.225 --> 02:44:31.793
[SPEAKER_37]: All the other ones are summer films, like Spider-Man, and then there was a couple other ones, Return of the Sith or whatever.

02:44:31.934 --> 02:44:33.735
[SPEAKER_37]: Anyways, yeah, I'm not a Star Wars fan.

02:44:33.775 --> 02:44:35.337
[SPEAKER_37]: Anyways, so I...

02:44:36.801 --> 02:44:40.924
[SPEAKER_37]: I saw the movie and it is really good.

02:44:41.104 --> 02:44:41.785
[SPEAKER_37]: I enjoyed it.

02:44:44.126 --> 02:44:49.250
[SPEAKER_37]: It fucking annoyed me at the beginning because, and it was weird because

02:44:50.356 --> 02:44:54.657
[SPEAKER_37]: The third one didn't annoy me at all for what they left out in the book.

02:44:54.757 --> 02:44:55.738
[SPEAKER_37]: I loved the film.

02:44:55.798 --> 02:44:57.938
[SPEAKER_37]: It was great the whole way through.

02:44:58.278 --> 02:44:59.499
[SPEAKER_37]: I saw it seven times.

02:44:59.959 --> 02:45:00.999
[SPEAKER_37]: I saw it in London.

02:45:01.859 --> 02:45:07.221
[SPEAKER_37]: It was something that was kind of like a magical experience for Christopher.

02:45:08.141 --> 02:45:10.742
[SPEAKER_37]: But this one kind of bugged me.

02:45:10.802 --> 02:45:12.462
[SPEAKER_37]: I kept on comparing it to the book.

02:45:12.823 --> 02:45:17.124
[SPEAKER_37]: I think it's because they left out so much and I was wanting to...

02:45:18.044 --> 02:45:19.746
[SPEAKER_37]: Thank you for watching, and I'll see you next time!

02:45:29.338 --> 02:45:30.439
[SPEAKER_37]: It's like so good.

02:45:30.599 --> 02:45:32.080
[SPEAKER_37]: It gets really good near the end.

02:45:32.501 --> 02:45:33.922
[SPEAKER_37]: And they do a lot of good stuff.

02:45:34.362 --> 02:45:36.885
[SPEAKER_37]: And it is dark, and it did earn its PG-13 rating.

02:45:37.365 --> 02:45:50.516
[SPEAKER_37]: Whether it was for the gratuitous sexual innuendos or the, you know, dark themes throughout the film, I don't know what it was, you know, why it was rated PG-13.

02:45:50.857 --> 02:45:52.899
[SPEAKER_37]: But it was rated PG-13 for a reason.

02:45:53.658 --> 02:45:54.959
[SPEAKER_37]: And it was really good.

02:45:55.039 --> 02:45:55.860
[SPEAKER_37]: I recommend it.

02:45:55.960 --> 02:46:10.053
[SPEAKER_37]: It's just that they rushed through the first half of the film so much that you're kind of feeling like you're ADD, like you can't focus on one particular scene, you know, because they take so much... It's like they wanted to put as much as they could from the book, but they just couldn't because of time constraints.

02:46:11.794 --> 02:46:12.235
[SPEAKER_37]: It was good.

02:46:12.835 --> 02:46:13.335
[SPEAKER_37]: I enjoyed it.

02:46:13.656 --> 02:46:14.857
[SPEAKER_37]: I enjoyed it mucho.

02:46:14.997 --> 02:46:15.717
[SPEAKER_37]: Recommend it.

02:46:16.958 --> 02:46:17.879
[SPEAKER_37]: So, thumbs up?

02:46:18.440 --> 02:46:19.941
[SPEAKER_37]: Thumbs up.

02:46:20.041 --> 02:46:22.063
[SPEAKER_37]: I didn't love it, but I liked it a lot.

02:46:23.824 --> 02:46:27.407
[SPEAKER_37]: And I can't wait for the next one, because that was my favorite book.

02:46:27.988 --> 02:46:29.068
[SPEAKER_32]: Alright.

02:46:29.088 --> 02:46:31.190
[SPEAKER_32]: We'll see what happens.

02:46:31.230 --> 02:46:33.912
[SPEAKER_32]: Moving on now, what we're going to do is we are...

02:46:36.940 --> 02:46:41.781
[SPEAKER_32]: Gonna go ahead and give DarkSakura another call because she's not able to be here in person tonight.

02:46:43.001 --> 02:46:46.262
[SPEAKER_32]: But she does want to talk to us all through the Skype line and let us know how she's enjoying the show.

02:46:48.062 --> 02:46:49.602
[SPEAKER_32]: And then we'll open the Skype line to the rest of you.

02:46:50.042 --> 02:46:50.862
[SPEAKER_32]: Because I promise we would.

02:46:51.763 --> 02:46:54.363
[SPEAKER_32]: We might have time to squeeze one more call in before the show's over.

02:46:55.843 --> 02:46:56.423
Hello?

02:46:56.623 --> 02:46:57.043
[SPEAKER_32]: Hello!

02:47:07.878 --> 02:47:08.298
[SPEAKER_32]: Jamie?

02:47:11.440 --> 02:47:13.082
[SPEAKER_32]: Well, it didn't have the... She didn't hang up on you?

02:47:13.242 --> 02:47:13.902
[SPEAKER_32]: No, she didn't hang up.

02:47:14.062 --> 02:47:14.503
[SPEAKER_32]: Oh, there we are.

02:47:14.663 --> 02:47:15.043
[SPEAKER_32]: Hello?

02:47:17.205 --> 02:47:17.785
[SPEAKER_32]: Can you hear me?

02:47:18.265 --> 02:47:19.666
[SPEAKER_32]: Yeah, we can kind of hear you.

02:47:21.367 --> 02:47:24.970
[SPEAKER_32]: I had to turn off the... That's weird.

02:47:25.210 --> 02:47:26.971
[SPEAKER_32]: Call us right back.

02:47:27.091 --> 02:47:27.692
[SPEAKER_32]: I hope she heard that.

02:47:27.732 --> 02:47:28.612
[SPEAKER_32]: Call us right back.

02:47:29.213 --> 02:47:30.073
[SPEAKER_32]: I hope she got that part.

02:47:30.614 --> 02:47:32.435
[SPEAKER_32]: Because it seems like it works better when she calls us.

02:47:32.715 --> 02:47:33.616
[SPEAKER_32]: I don't know if it's just me.

02:47:33.656 --> 02:47:36.418
[SPEAKER_37]: It's like she's not Dark Sakura, she's Dark Sock.

02:47:38.066 --> 02:47:38.466
[SPEAKER_37]: Hello!

02:47:41.047 --> 02:47:41.727
[SPEAKER_32]: Coffee cough.

02:47:41.747 --> 02:47:43.127
[SPEAKER_32]: Well, at least we know we can hear her this time.

02:47:43.167 --> 02:47:44.267
[SPEAKER_32]: I know, doesn't she sound so sick?

02:47:44.447 --> 02:47:45.328
[SPEAKER_32]: How are you, Jamie?

02:47:46.508 --> 02:47:47.008
Nah!

02:47:47.908 --> 02:47:48.929
[SPEAKER_32]: Are you enjoying the show?

02:47:50.009 --> 02:47:50.609
[SPEAKER_11]: Sort of.

02:47:50.829 --> 02:47:52.189
[SPEAKER_32]: Yeah?

02:47:52.309 --> 02:47:56.050
[SPEAKER_11]: It's better when I'm there, because it's, you know... I know.

02:47:56.110 --> 02:47:59.471
[SPEAKER_32]: Mel and Melody say hello, of course, and, you know, hope you feel better and stuff.

02:48:01.030 --> 02:48:02.830
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, I'm not running a fever anymore.

02:48:03.350 --> 02:48:04.011
[SPEAKER_32]: That's good.

02:48:04.911 --> 02:48:05.891
[SPEAKER_32]: They brought you a present.

02:48:06.871 --> 02:48:06.991
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh?

02:48:07.251 --> 02:48:11.272
[SPEAKER_32]: I can't say what it is because it's something I got someone else for their birthday who might be listening.

02:48:11.432 --> 02:48:13.713
[SPEAKER_32]: So, it's something.

02:48:13.893 --> 02:48:14.993
[SPEAKER_32]: I'll send you a private message.

02:48:15.893 --> 02:48:16.393
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

02:48:16.573 --> 02:48:16.833
[SPEAKER_32]: Okay.

02:48:18.374 --> 02:48:20.474
[SPEAKER_11]: We've got ten minutes left on the show.

02:48:20.774 --> 02:48:21.074
[SPEAKER_32]: I know.

02:48:21.534 --> 02:48:22.454
[SPEAKER_32]: Aw, sweetie, feel better.

02:48:23.695 --> 02:48:26.395
[SPEAKER_32]: Well, is there anything else you wanted to say to the listeners?

02:48:26.455 --> 02:48:28.056
[SPEAKER_32]: Give them a final thought of some sort?

02:48:29.876 --> 02:48:29.976
[SPEAKER_11]: Um...

02:48:31.520 --> 02:48:32.540
[SPEAKER_11]: I like burritos.

02:48:32.940 --> 02:48:33.841
[SPEAKER_11]: I ate one today.

02:48:34.501 --> 02:48:35.681
[SPEAKER_32]: Congratulations.

02:48:36.442 --> 02:48:37.982
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't like lung cookies.

02:48:38.462 --> 02:48:40.403
[SPEAKER_11]: I feel like my cat.

02:48:40.643 --> 02:48:42.163
[SPEAKER_32]: Don't burritos make you fart, though?

02:48:43.304 --> 02:48:44.584
[SPEAKER_11]: No, they make me throw up.

02:48:44.684 --> 02:48:46.124
[SPEAKER_32]: That's the problem I have with burritos.

02:48:46.205 --> 02:48:47.705
[SPEAKER_32]: They make me fart like a whole bunch.

02:48:47.865 --> 02:48:49.125
[SPEAKER_32]: That is new information.

02:48:49.145 --> 02:48:49.546
[SPEAKER_32]: Thank you for that.

02:48:49.566 --> 02:48:51.086
[SPEAKER_11]: I know what my cat feels like, though.

02:48:52.466 --> 02:48:53.607
[SPEAKER_32]: Oh, go ahead.

02:48:53.627 --> 02:48:56.548
[SPEAKER_11]: Because horking up lung cookies is like horking up air balls.

02:48:58.647 --> 02:48:59.387
[SPEAKER_32]: I saw Adam Curry's hair.

02:48:59.407 --> 02:49:00.368
[SPEAKER_32]: He was stood a foot away from me.

02:49:00.388 --> 02:49:00.948
[SPEAKER_32]: He's still hot.

02:49:27.887 --> 02:49:30.869
[SPEAKER_11]: And he's like put on muscle or something.

02:49:30.929 --> 02:49:32.510
[SPEAKER_11]: He looks like really good shape.

02:49:32.690 --> 02:49:33.590
[SPEAKER_32]: Maybe he's been working out.

02:49:34.270 --> 02:49:34.711
[SPEAKER_11]: Maybe.

02:49:35.311 --> 02:49:42.955
[SPEAKER_11]: But I think now that he's a little older, he actually looks more handsome than he did back in his, you know, glam-looking 80s days.

02:49:45.396 --> 02:49:46.437
[SPEAKER_11]: Did you get to get up on stage?

02:49:48.898 --> 02:49:52.160
[SPEAKER_11]: No, they didn't let us say anything, so Julie and I just leeched off the buffet.

02:49:53.080 --> 02:49:54.001
[SPEAKER_32]: Hey, awesome food!

02:49:55.006 --> 02:49:58.607
[SPEAKER_11]: It was actually really good food, but the thing is that they didn't want to let us in because we didn't have badges.

02:49:58.627 --> 02:50:00.228
[SPEAKER_11]: We were like, hey, we won a prize.

02:50:00.848 --> 02:50:01.868
[SPEAKER_11]: Like, okay, you can come in.

02:50:02.909 --> 02:50:04.769
[SPEAKER_37]: Was Adam Curry wearing leather?

02:50:05.790 --> 02:50:11.652
[SPEAKER_11]: No, he was wearing like, like a tux, except he didn't have the jacket or the tie in.

02:50:11.692 --> 02:50:12.952
[SPEAKER_11]: It was sort of unbuttoned at the top.

02:50:13.192 --> 02:50:16.293
[SPEAKER_11]: It was that very casual, dressy look.

02:50:16.413 --> 02:50:18.134
[SPEAKER_32]: What a lazy, lazy bat.

02:50:18.174 --> 02:50:18.634
[SPEAKER_32]: No, I'm kidding.

02:50:19.795 --> 02:50:23.816
[SPEAKER_11]: Hey, there were people who were dressed in, you know, like, like,

02:50:24.435 --> 02:50:30.379
[SPEAKER_11]: Nice clothes and then people who were sort of not so nice.

02:50:31.580 --> 02:50:37.084
[SPEAKER_11]: Like people who were wearing like what you wear to like go work out in or something.

02:50:37.384 --> 02:50:41.007
[SPEAKER_32]: Now, you know, if I had gone, I would have dressed fabulously if I had went.

02:50:41.207 --> 02:50:42.308
[SPEAKER_11]: I dressed fabulously.

02:50:42.328 --> 02:50:42.768
[SPEAKER_11]: What did you wear?

02:50:42.788 --> 02:50:43.949
[SPEAKER_11]: I forgot to put on my boots.

02:50:44.730 --> 02:50:46.151
[SPEAKER_32]: Did you wear your angel wings?

02:50:46.971 --> 02:50:47.612
[SPEAKER_11]: No, I didn't.

02:50:47.832 --> 02:50:49.273
[SPEAKER_11]: You forgot to put on your boots.

02:50:49.833 --> 02:50:52.035
[SPEAKER_11]: You know those really hot pants I have?

02:50:52.555 --> 02:50:53.016
[SPEAKER_32]: I'm sorry, what?

02:50:53.644 --> 02:50:53.904
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I did.

02:50:53.924 --> 02:50:54.044
[SPEAKER_11]: I met...

02:51:24.271 --> 02:51:30.435
[SPEAKER_11]: Frank from The Overnightscape, a really cool independent talk show podcast.

02:51:33.297 --> 02:51:37.880
[SPEAKER_11]: I met a few other people from the general New Jersey area, pretty cool folks.

02:51:39.081 --> 02:51:40.141
[SPEAKER_11]: We hung out there for a while.

02:51:40.182 --> 02:51:44.945
[SPEAKER_11]: I actually got interviewed for his podcast as one of the winners.

02:51:45.325 --> 02:51:47.506
[SPEAKER_32]: I wonder if that's aired yet.

02:51:47.546 --> 02:51:48.327
[SPEAKER_32]: We'll have to check that out.

02:51:48.919 --> 02:51:50.821
[SPEAKER_11]: Probably, he does his nightly.

02:51:51.102 --> 02:51:52.764
[SPEAKER_32]: Oh my god, that's a lot.

02:51:53.444 --> 02:51:54.806
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, that's a bit much.

02:51:55.547 --> 02:51:55.827
[SPEAKER_32]: I know.

02:51:56.168 --> 02:51:58.130
[SPEAKER_32]: Could you imagine if we tried to do OLR nightly?

02:51:58.170 --> 02:51:58.851
[SPEAKER_32]: Oh my god, we'd die.

02:51:59.104 --> 02:51:59.905
[SPEAKER_11]: We don't have no life

02:52:28.567 --> 02:52:34.189
[SPEAKER_32]: Alright, we're going to open up the Skype line now, but it's the lightning round, kids.

02:52:34.609 --> 02:52:35.689
[SPEAKER_32]: This is the lightning round.

02:52:36.750 --> 02:52:38.070
[SPEAKER_32]: Put in some thunder here.

02:52:38.510 --> 02:52:42.791
[SPEAKER_32]: It's the lightning round of our Skype line being open because you only get two minutes.

02:52:43.612 --> 02:52:45.632
[SPEAKER_32]: Because we're almost out of time.

02:52:45.812 --> 02:52:46.493
[SPEAKER_32]: That's not thunder.

02:52:46.513 --> 02:52:50.234
[SPEAKER_21]: Alright, here we go.

02:52:52.726 --> 02:52:53.247
[SPEAKER_32]: That is Bethany.

02:52:53.607 --> 02:52:54.808
[SPEAKER_32]: Hi, you're on Orange Silence Radio.

02:52:55.008 --> 02:52:55.349
[SPEAKER_32]: Hello.

02:52:55.669 --> 02:52:57.310
[SPEAKER_40]: Obviously, I need no introduction.

02:52:57.350 --> 02:52:58.191
[SPEAKER_40]: You already know who this is.

02:52:58.211 --> 02:52:58.532
[SPEAKER_32]: Two minutes, Daku.

02:52:58.552 --> 02:52:59.052
[SPEAKER_40]: Two minutes.

02:52:59.572 --> 02:52:59.973
[SPEAKER_40]: Go.

02:53:00.693 --> 02:53:08.380
[SPEAKER_40]: Alright, basically, when I was in the MTV thing, they are going to be... The DDR player they're going to be doing it on is this cat named Sketch.

02:53:08.701 --> 02:53:09.982
[SPEAKER_40]: He's one of the best players in the industry.

02:53:10.002 --> 02:53:10.763
[SPEAKER_40]: Like, literally a cat?

02:53:11.894 --> 02:53:15.256
[SPEAKER_40]: No, I mean it in a noun way.

02:53:15.276 --> 02:53:17.637
[SPEAKER_40]: Look, there's this DDR player named Sketch.

02:53:17.997 --> 02:53:19.878
[SPEAKER_34]: Okay, I'll stop taking away your minutes.

02:53:19.898 --> 02:53:21.299
[SPEAKER_40]: Go ahead.

02:53:21.759 --> 02:53:22.719
[SPEAKER_32]: He's a freestyler.

02:53:25.000 --> 02:53:25.821
[SPEAKER_32]: No, go ahead.

02:53:26.001 --> 02:53:27.101
[SPEAKER_32]: S versus being a smartass.

02:53:27.121 --> 02:53:29.543
[SPEAKER_32]: Keep talking.

02:53:31.023 --> 02:53:32.124
[SPEAKER_31]: Great, he broke his train.

02:53:34.046 --> 02:53:38.688
[SPEAKER_40]: As I said, all they're really going to focus on is him.

02:53:38.728 --> 02:53:41.910
[SPEAKER_40]: He's the only DDR player that they shine their cameras on.

02:53:42.950 --> 02:53:58.317
[SPEAKER_40]: They just basically asked him a few questions about his playing skills, and apparently they even went as far as making him breakdance on a carpeted floor on the stage.

02:54:00.017 --> 02:54:00.357
[SPEAKER_40]: Okay.

02:54:03.496 --> 02:54:09.250
[SPEAKER_40]: So, pretty much, he will be in an MTV Overdrive special, I think, on Tuesday.

02:54:09.975 --> 02:54:14.696
[SPEAKER_40]: But the segment will probably air this Tuesday, you know, in that episode of Direct Effect.

02:54:14.816 --> 02:54:17.317
[SPEAKER_40]: So... I'm already setting up my TiVo.

02:54:17.337 --> 02:54:19.097
[SPEAKER_40]: You'll definitely get a glimpse of him.

02:54:19.497 --> 02:54:20.358
[SPEAKER_40]: Zach, who am I going to see?

02:54:20.398 --> 02:54:22.578
[SPEAKER_40]: Am I going to see you on the TiVo?

02:54:22.618 --> 02:54:26.379
[SPEAKER_40]: So, you're probably going to be saying... You're probably going to be, you know, TiVo it, I assume.

02:54:27.399 --> 02:54:29.200
[SPEAKER_40]: Yeah, I'm going to TiVo it.

02:54:29.740 --> 02:54:34.361
[SPEAKER_40]: And basically critique it like we always do with other things.

02:54:34.661 --> 02:54:35.001
[SPEAKER_22]: We'll see.

02:54:35.701 --> 02:54:36.402
[SPEAKER_40]: Are you going to be on it?

02:54:36.442 --> 02:54:37.242
[SPEAKER_40]: Another thing, um...

02:54:40.523 --> 02:54:48.166
[SPEAKER_40]: One of the hosts from Direct Effect actually had the gall to walk out of the stage when she refused to do a segment again.

02:54:50.267 --> 02:54:51.707
[SPEAKER_40]: She refused to retake a segment.

02:54:52.588 --> 02:54:58.150
[SPEAKER_40]: Fucking Lala Vasquez, the host of Direct Effect, who was pretty damn clueless about DDR to begin with.

02:54:59.329 --> 02:55:01.192
[SPEAKER_40]: So she was like, what the hell is DDR?

02:55:01.232 --> 02:55:03.034
[SPEAKER_40]: Is that that game with all the... Time's up.

02:55:03.275 --> 02:55:04.837
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, next call.

02:55:05.718 --> 02:55:06.860
[SPEAKER_10]: Hi, you're on Orange Science Radio.

02:55:07.040 --> 02:55:07.440
[SPEAKER_10]: Who's this?

02:55:07.661 --> 02:55:08.542
[SPEAKER_10]: Hey, this is GS191.

02:55:08.722 --> 02:55:10.264
[SPEAKER_10]: Hi, two minutes.

02:55:10.605 --> 02:55:10.905
[SPEAKER_10]: Hurry up.

02:55:10.925 --> 02:55:11.927
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, what's up?

02:55:11.967 --> 02:55:14.130
[SPEAKER_10]: Hey, you didn't save my FUs, man.

02:55:14.150 --> 02:55:14.470
[SPEAKER_10]: Jeez.

02:55:14.891 --> 02:55:15.291
[SPEAKER_10]: I didn't?

02:55:15.351 --> 02:55:16.213
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm sorry, I didn't mean to.

02:55:17.375 --> 02:55:18.096
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, that's okay, man.

02:55:18.236 --> 02:55:19.477
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, you got two minutes.

02:55:19.537 --> 02:55:19.977
[SPEAKER_10]: Go for it.

02:55:20.558 --> 02:55:21.158
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, man.

02:55:21.718 --> 02:55:27.723
[SPEAKER_10]: My FU was Best Buy because I just started there like about a week ago.

02:55:27.743 --> 02:55:28.083
[SPEAKER_10]: Uh-huh.

02:55:28.103 --> 02:55:28.344
[SPEAKER_10]: Uh-huh.

02:55:29.925 --> 02:55:32.026
[SPEAKER_10]: And now they want me to come in at 4 a.m.

02:55:32.067 --> 02:55:33.348
[SPEAKER_10]: in the morning on Black Friday.

02:55:34.268 --> 02:55:34.729
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, my God.

02:55:34.749 --> 02:55:35.910
[SPEAKER_10]: Are you having to work Tuesday?

02:55:36.892 --> 02:55:39.294
[SPEAKER_10]: Tuesday, the Xbox day.

02:55:39.974 --> 02:55:40.494
[SPEAKER_32]: No, I don't.

02:55:40.755 --> 02:55:41.315
[SPEAKER_32]: Thank God.

02:55:41.996 --> 02:55:42.676
[SPEAKER_32]: Yes, yes.

02:55:43.537 --> 02:55:45.318
[SPEAKER_32]: You'd have to come in at like 3 a.m.

02:55:45.698 --> 02:55:49.381
[SPEAKER_32]: to beat people up on the line and stuff or something.

02:55:49.401 --> 02:55:49.721
[SPEAKER_32]: I don't know.

02:55:50.521 --> 02:55:51.082
[SPEAKER_32]: Yeah, pretty much.

02:55:52.183 --> 02:55:53.043
[SPEAKER_32]: Anything else you want to share?

02:55:54.444 --> 02:55:55.365
[SPEAKER_32]: No, no, no.

02:55:55.605 --> 02:55:58.147
[SPEAKER_32]: You have a minute ten left before I hang up on you.

02:55:59.167 --> 02:55:59.928
[SPEAKER_32]: I got to go now.

02:56:00.088 --> 02:56:00.448
[SPEAKER_32]: All right.

02:56:00.508 --> 02:56:01.929
[SPEAKER_32]: Well, I want to hang up on you anyway, okay?

02:56:02.590 --> 02:56:02.830
[SPEAKER_32]: All right.

02:56:02.850 --> 02:56:03.490
[SPEAKER_32]: All right, there we go.

02:56:03.750 --> 02:56:04.071
[SPEAKER_32]: All right.

[SPEAKER_32]: Next up.

02:56:06.809 --> 02:56:08.830
[SPEAKER_32]: Lightning Round, two minutes, what's up, who's this?

02:56:13.312 --> 02:56:14.393
[SPEAKER_32]: Alright, two minutes, what's up?

02:56:15.713 --> 02:56:17.334
[SPEAKER_13]: What is?

02:56:17.594 --> 02:56:17.714
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

02:56:17.774 --> 02:56:19.655
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh yeah, Mario Kart DS is badass, I love it.

02:56:27.575 --> 02:56:27.775

[SPEAKER_32]: Alright.

02:56:33.599 --> 02:56:35.320
[SPEAKER_13]: And Loki, give me your friend code, can't it?

02:56:35.340 --> 02:56:36.840
[SPEAKER_32]: It's on the forums.

02:56:37.121 --> 02:56:38.541
[SPEAKER_32]: Oh yeah, Loki put it on the forums.

02:56:38.842 --> 02:56:42.924
[SPEAKER_32]: OrangeLogsRadio.com He's not, I'm afraid of the stalkers more than he is.

02:56:44.425 --> 02:56:44.725
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

02:56:44.785 --> 02:56:46.426
[SPEAKER_32]: Alright, a minute twenty, what else is on your mind?

02:56:47.386 --> 02:56:50.308
[SPEAKER_13]: Uh, I score as a DDL club now, which is like pretty cool.

02:56:51.209 --> 02:56:51.389
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.

02:56:52.199 --> 02:56:52.499
[SPEAKER_32]: Cool.

02:56:53.000 --> 02:56:53.540
[SPEAKER_32]: Where's that at?

02:56:54.561 --> 02:56:55.742
[SPEAKER_13]: Uh, at my school.

02:56:56.222 --> 02:56:56.563
[SPEAKER_32]: Alright.

02:56:57.083 --> 02:56:58.945
[SPEAKER_32]: Well, is this like high school, college, or what?

02:56:59.425 --> 02:56:59.765
[SPEAKER_32]: High school.

02:57:00.106 --> 02:57:00.786
[SPEAKER_32]: Alright, awesome.

02:57:01.026 --> 02:57:02.027
[SPEAKER_13]: We're in Ohio.

02:57:02.568 --> 02:57:02.848
[SPEAKER_32]: Okay.

02:57:03.488 --> 02:57:06.751
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, and now you can see I've only done a few rounds of DDR.

02:57:06.971 --> 02:57:08.573
[SPEAKER_13]: It's called 3.

02:57:09.013 --> 02:57:09.373
[SPEAKER_32]: Yeah.

02:57:09.894 --> 02:57:12.936
[SPEAKER_32]: Are you guys going to be bringing Ultramix 3 into your club?

02:57:14.398 --> 02:57:16.739
[SPEAKER_13]: Uh, I really have no clue.

02:57:16.960 --> 02:57:18.341
[SPEAKER_32]: Alright, I thought I'd ask.

02:57:19.110 --> 02:57:21.752
[SPEAKER_13]: Nothing that I really know other than ADR.

02:57:48.157 --> 02:57:52.679
[SPEAKER_32]: What we used to do in high school is we used to order pizza and then do whatever our club thing was.

02:57:52.719 --> 02:57:54.120
[SPEAKER_32]: Do you guys do pizza in DDR?

02:57:55.301 --> 02:57:57.322
[SPEAKER_13]: Not that I know of.

02:57:57.402 --> 02:57:57.902
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, okay.

02:57:58.483 --> 02:58:06.648
[SPEAKER_13]: One thing is I was at two TV saloons, so we didn't have two going on.

02:58:06.888 --> 02:58:07.668
[SPEAKER_32]: And that's two minutes.

02:58:07.929 --> 02:58:08.289
[SPEAKER_32]: All right.

02:58:09.209 --> 02:58:10.370
[SPEAKER_32]: Well, the lightning round's fun.

02:58:10.650 --> 02:58:11.591
[SPEAKER_32]: Jeez, you're a bitch.

02:58:12.788 --> 02:58:14.390
[SPEAKER_32]: Okay, you're going to get off my line right now.

02:58:14.450 --> 02:58:15.511
[SPEAKER_32]: Okay, bye, bye, bye.

02:58:15.911 --> 02:58:19.254
[SPEAKER_32]: I know, and then I talk and take up their whole two minutes, but that's part of the fun of it.

02:58:20.295 --> 02:58:21.576
[SPEAKER_21]: You know what?

02:58:21.696 --> 02:58:28.603
[SPEAKER_32]: The lightning round, I know, I cut Zaku off so bad, I'm so sorry, but I think we need to institute the lightning round every time we do Skype.

02:58:28.663 --> 02:58:29.203
[SPEAKER_32]: That's fun.

02:58:29.844 --> 02:58:30.344
[SPEAKER_32]: It is fun.

02:58:30.685 --> 02:58:31.365
[SPEAKER_32]: See what I love doing?

02:58:31.385 --> 02:58:34.688
[SPEAKER_32]: Do you see how I coaxed him to talk for 30 more seconds just so I could hang up on him?

02:58:38.092 --> 02:58:40.795
[SPEAKER_37]: Yeah, I feel bad, but it's still funny, so you should still do it.

02:58:40.815 --> 02:58:41.656
[SPEAKER_32]: All right, show's over.

02:58:41.836 --> 02:58:42.577
[SPEAKER_32]: Final thoughts.

02:58:42.757 --> 02:58:43.457
[SPEAKER_32]: Lightning round.

02:58:44.018 --> 02:58:45.479
[SPEAKER_32]: Five seconds for your... No, I'm kidding.

02:58:46.120 --> 02:58:46.641
[SPEAKER_32]: Final thoughts.

02:58:46.741 --> 02:58:47.481
[SPEAKER_32]: Angel, your final thought.

02:58:50.324 --> 02:58:50.945
[SPEAKER_25]: I don't know.

02:58:51.465 --> 02:58:51.866
[SPEAKER_25]: So there.

02:58:52.186 --> 02:58:53.227
[SPEAKER_37]: Okay.

02:58:53.347 --> 02:58:54.328

[SPEAKER_37]: Extifer's Case of the Mondays, Monday at 7 o'clock.

02:59:00.106 --> 02:59:05.475
[SPEAKER_37]: Email me, damn it, xperiaxperiaxperia.com Loki, your final thought.

02:59:06.597 --> 02:59:07.919
[SPEAKER_32]: I just lost my song.

02:59:09.722 --> 02:59:12.908
[SPEAKER_32]: And my final thought is, whatever.

02:59:15.864 --> 02:59:17.205
[SPEAKER_32]: Life needs a hang-up button.

02:59:17.405 --> 02:59:18.347
[SPEAKER_32]: That's my final thought.

02:59:18.427 --> 02:59:19.708
[SPEAKER_32]: Life needs a hang-up button.

02:59:19.989 --> 02:59:20.649
[SPEAKER_32]: Hear, hear.

[SPEAKER_32]: Final word.

[SPEAKER_32]: One word to sum up the whole damn show in one word or less.

02:59:27.137 --> 02:59:30.541
[SPEAKER_32]: I'm going to give it to Extifer, tonight's final word.

02:59:31.462 --> 02:59:31.703
