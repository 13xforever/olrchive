Yo.

How you doing?

07:18.780 --> 07:22.060
This microphone is heavy.

07:22.060 --> 07:24.220
I also drink the blood of young virgins.

07:24.220 --> 07:25.220
Hot.

07:25.220 --> 07:27.060
I'm having it for dinner right now.

07:27.060 --> 07:29.060
It is salad dressing.

07:29.060 --> 07:35.060
I think that's what I think that they use in their salad dressings at McDonald's. It has to be something that tastes fairly...

07:35.060 --> 07:39.060
We may have to switch mics, because for some reason that one's not picking you up so well.

07:39.060 --> 07:41.060
LA!

07:41.060 --> 07:45.060
Let's do this. Just make sure when you're talking, the little switch is out this way, otherwise it won't pick you up.

07:45.060 --> 07:50.060
This is my microphone.

07:50.060 --> 07:52.060
I know, but I switched it because we had trouble...

07:52.060 --> 07:56.060
Don't change things on me! It makes me anxious!

07:56.060 --> 07:58.660
And when I get anxious, people die!

07:58.660 --> 08:00.260
They're all gonna get you.

08:00.260 --> 08:02.660
Mmmmmm, salad.

08:02.660 --> 08:06.460
Something's weird with this microphone. Like, it is really quiet. I don't know.

08:06.460 --> 08:08.060
Everything's breaking!

08:08.060 --> 08:09.860
I blame the powers of darkness.

08:09.860 --> 08:12.660
Oh, here we go. Here we go. A little better.

08:12.660 --> 08:13.860
Yes, Blame Jack Thompson.

08:13.860 --> 08:15.460
Here on Orange Lounge Radio.

08:15.460 --> 08:16.260
Blame Jack Thompson.

08:16.260 --> 08:21.060
It is Jack Thompson. He's trying to sabotage us because we speak the truth.

08:21.060 --> 08:24.500
Alright also joining us on tonight's program say hello to the one and only Loki

08:27.260 --> 08:32.100

Check check check check there. We go there. We go now. I can hear myself

08:48.380 --> 08:49.380
So?

08:49.380 --> 08:50.380
Oh, darn!

08:50.380 --> 08:51.380
This internet sucks.

08:51.380 --> 08:52.380
It really does.

08:52.380 --> 08:53.380
All right.

08:53.380 --> 08:57.660
Anyway, now that we've got our sound issues worked out, we can actually have ourselves

08:57.660 --> 08:59.300
a little bit of a show tonight.

08:59.300 --> 09:04.180
I know I want to talk a lot about Guitar Hero, because it's really cool.

09:04.180 --> 09:07.020
And we're also going to talk about, of course, our weeks and our day.

09:07.020 --> 09:11.900
We're going to talk about a cool interview that we're going to have on tonight's podcast.

09:11.900 --> 09:14.780
And then we're going to talk about whatever tickles our fancy.

09:14.780 --> 09:16.820
And then we're going to set a guitar on fire.

09:16.820 --> 09:17.820
We just might.

09:17.820 --> 09:21.820
So first, say hello to our special guest, because it wouldn't be a show if we didn't have some special guests.

09:21.820 --> 09:23.820
Say hello to Bugd.

09:23.820 --> 09:25.820
Hello to Bugd.

09:25.820 --> 09:27.820
And also say hello to DDR Angel.

09:27.820 --> 09:30.820
Hello. My salad just exploded.

09:30.820 --> 09:32.820
That sounds hot.

09:32.820 --> 09:35.820
You don't want to know.

09:35.820 --> 09:39.820
All right, and Extifer is around as well.

09:39.820 --> 09:42.820
He might pop in a little later in the show, hopefully to give him some movie review.

09:42.820 --> 09:43.820
He's smuggling his new Mac.

09:43.820 --> 09:46.820
Yes, he's making sweet love to his new Macintosh.

09:49.820 --> 09:51.820

And what's going on in the video game world. We'll be back.

10:02.820 --> 10:05.820
I figured we could maybe continue the theme of the pre-show tonight,

10:05.820 --> 10:08.820
because the pre-show tonight was a lot of disco music.

10:08.820 --> 10:10.820
So we're gonna continue on and get down.

10:10.820 --> 10:16.060

11:06.560 --> 11:08.060

11:11.060 --> 11:15.060
J.P, J.P, J.P, J.P, J.P

Get up, move up out the door, it ain't much time, it ain't long

12:26.560 --> 12:29.560
And there's bright lights starring no coke flow

12:29.560 --> 12:30.060
So what?

12:30.060 --> 12:32.060
A kung fu fighter in a disco

12:32.060 --> 12:34.560
He's out to take his chance, he knows the honey's in the house

12:34.560 --> 12:36.560
Only coke for romance

12:36.560 --> 12:40.560
He's got a white suit on, five past one and the night has just begun

12:40.560 --> 12:42.560
It's when he lays it on with the style

12:42.560 --> 12:44.560
A lady's mad with a nice smile

12:44.560 --> 12:46.560
And right before his eyes

12:46.560 --> 12:48.560
He sees a pretty old thing looking real fly

12:48.560 --> 12:52.560
He wants to make the score, so he takes the hand and leads her to the dance floor.

12:52.560 --> 12:54.560
He's leaving her line after line.

12:54.560 --> 12:56.560
She tells him that he looks real fine.

12:56.560 --> 12:58.560
He gives the man perfect timing.

12:58.560 --> 13:00.560
He's right when he's combo fighting.

13:00.560 --> 13:05.560

15:24.940 --> 15:27.380
The sections on the top keep moving, moving

15:27.380 --> 15:29.080
The beat is just west is grooving

15:29.080 --> 15:31.020

15:33.840 --> 15:36.420
I hold the mic and go cause Rob is in full control

15:36.420 --> 15:37.780
Name same, a game of fame

15:37.780 --> 15:40.380
I'm what I see from Rob, the rhyme with rhyme being made

15:40.380 --> 15:47.300
So far that I'm falling in love, falling in love

15:47.300 --> 15:49.300
I love the music

15:51.300 --> 15:55.300
Don't stop the music, don't stop the music, don't stop the music, don't stop the music

15:55.300 --> 15:57.300
I just love the music

15:59.300 --> 16:02.300
Don't stop the music, don't stop the music The keys, they'll go away

16:02.300 --> 16:28.300
Hello? Hello is this thing on? Testing. Testing one, two.

16:28.300 --> 16:32.300
I'm looking in the index, but I don't see anything on how to run a radio show.

16:32.300 --> 16:36.300
Hello? I don't understand this. Does this thing work?

16:36.300 --> 16:38.300
This thing reads like stereo instructions.

16:38.300 --> 16:39.300
Is this on?

16:39.300 --> 16:40.300
What the hell?

16:41.300 --> 16:45.300
Orange Lounge Radio. Broke-down ghetto Pamani radio.

16:45.300 --> 16:47.300
What the f***?

16:47.300 --> 16:49.300
Hi, kids. We're back here on Orange Lounge Radio.

16:49.300 --> 16:52.300
And I know we've been having some mic problems tonight or something,

16:52.300 --> 16:54.300
so we tried fixing it a little bit during the break,

16:54.300 --> 16:57.300
so I hope that our mic quality is a little better now.

16:57.300 --> 17:00.960
now but if not you'll just have to deal with it I guess well I don't know we

17:00.960 --> 17:04.320
tried to patch some things up and we checked Mike out and replaced him yeah

17:04.320 --> 17:08.460
that's right we fired so hopefully things are a little bit a little better

17:08.460 --> 17:13.860
now anyway those responsible have just been sacked yes and those are the

17:13.860 --> 17:18.820
sacking is have also been signed at Infinium assembly a giant foot comes

17:18.820 --> 17:22.180
crashing down on our program will now continue the rest of this program in the

17:22.180 --> 17:29.660
That's why they haven't kicked us out, right?

17:29.660 --> 17:30.660
Yeah.

17:30.660 --> 17:34.020
Moving on, I want to get into this real quickly, because we were talking about this a little

17:34.020 --> 17:36.380
bit during the break, before we get into a little bit of How's Your Week, How's Your

17:36.380 --> 17:37.380
Day.

17:37.380 --> 17:39.820
But Loki's randomly surfing the internet, as he does when he's on this program, because

17:39.820 --> 17:42.060
he doesn't really like to participate in the program.

17:42.060 --> 17:45.340
He just surfs the internet randomly and giggles once in a while in the corner.

17:45.340 --> 17:49.180
So Loki, what was this article you found about the AOL guy?

17:49.180 --> 17:50.660
You found an article about the AOL guy?

17:50.660 --> 18:00.660
The AOL guy is basically selling himself to make custom WAV files for your email programs or what have you.

18:00.660 --> 18:08.660
And he's charging, I believe, $12 per WAV file or something like that.

18:08.660 --> 18:13.660
He's already sold himself to the devil. He may as well sell himself to everybody else.

18:13.660 --> 18:16.660
Can you get him to say anything?

18:16.660 --> 18:18.660
Well, I have no idea.

18:18.660 --> 18:25.140
make him record a WAV file and send it to my ex that goes, you've got herpes.

18:25.140 --> 18:32.380
It says, let's see here, yeah, one WAV file, it would be $12 for a non-AOL file, $30 for

18:32.380 --> 18:40.720
five files, so that's a little break there. It says basically, it doesn't really say what

18:40.720 --> 18:45.300
else he'll do, just pretty much whatever, I guess, you want.

18:45.300 --> 18:50.300
Is there a limit to the number of words he'll say?

18:50.300 --> 18:53.300
I don't know. It doesn't say.

18:53.300 --> 18:57.300
I wonder if I'm singing I'm a little teapot.

18:57.300 --> 19:02.300
I'm a little teapot. Short hand stout.

19:02.300 --> 19:07.300
You've got mail. You've got hot tea.

19:07.300 --> 19:12.300
I think he'll do you've got mail and stuff.

19:12.300 --> 19:18.820
you've got mail Bob or you've got mail you got served nobody graces to give him

19:18.820 --> 19:28.180
like a name that has no vowels and it just like all consonants you can

19:28.180 --> 19:33.380
technically get away with that if you used a lie that's true no but just like

19:33.380 --> 19:37.700
some made-up thing is like my name is you just hit a bunch of keys you know

19:37.700 --> 19:39.640
known

19:39.640 --> 19:43.100
exerts the access to con or something you just make it up and like when he

19:43.100 --> 19:48.340
doesn't say it right now no you bastard that's my name emphasis on the x

19:48.340 --> 19:50.580
some ancient egyptian name

19:50.580 --> 19:52.900
or like uh... my

19:52.900 --> 19:53.820
awesome

19:53.820 --> 19:58.520
so yeah they can pronounce something in a while she'll totally screw it up

19:58.520 --> 20:03.220
in a foreign language can you imagine what it must be like as him you

20:03.220 --> 20:04.620
know it's just

20:04.620 --> 20:10.100
It's just really bad stuff, I mean, you know, he's all makin' love to his wife, oh yeah,

20:10.100 --> 20:13.260
you know, just really weird, he's got a weird voice.

20:13.260 --> 20:16.380
Dang it, I only get hot when you say it!

20:16.380 --> 20:17.380
You've got male.

20:17.380 --> 20:18.380
Oh, baby!

20:18.380 --> 20:24.700
It's like, remember, um, it was Carlos, not Carlos Menzies, but, uh, Paulo Francisco and

20:24.700 --> 20:28.660
the movie guy, and the movie voice guy, and him, you know, making love to himself.

20:28.660 --> 20:30.660
Oh, yeah, I think that's an old, yeah.

20:30.660 --> 20:31.660
A passion.

20:31.660 --> 20:32.660
Anyways.

20:32.660 --> 20:36.540
Alright, anyway, we're gonna start off tonight's program as we always start off every week's

20:36.540 --> 20:39.140
show with playing a little bit of How Was Your Week, How Was Your Day, and this is the

20:39.140 --> 20:43.740
part where we find out, in the hosts' lives, how was that week, or day.

20:43.740 --> 20:45.740
Talk, Sakura?

20:45.740 --> 20:50.820
My week was crap in a basket.

20:50.820 --> 20:55.540
I'm not even a well-put-together basket, it was sort of like a mildewed basket like you

20:55.540 --> 20:57.540
find in the thrift store.

20:57.540 --> 20:58.540
Eww.

20:58.540 --> 20:59.540
Yeah.

20:59.540 --> 21:07.420
I went to the doctor Tuesday with a migraine, and so now I found out that my brain might

21:07.420 --> 21:08.420
be broken.

21:08.420 --> 21:11.980
So I get to go in for a CT scan on Monday.

21:11.980 --> 21:13.620
Fine, huh?

21:13.620 --> 21:20.420
I don't want to make a joke, but I have to say this.

21:20.420 --> 21:21.420
It's not the tumor.

21:21.420 --> 21:22.420
I eat fat in the car.

21:22.420 --> 21:29.420
The only time my headache wasn't present was when I was really drunk.

21:29.420 --> 21:33.420
I don't want to come across as insensitive to the listeners, so...

21:33.420 --> 21:39.420
I have the diagnosis. You're allergic to sobriety.

21:39.420 --> 21:42.420
That's probably it.

21:42.420 --> 21:46.420
I know, I'm so smart. That'll be $50, please.

21:46.420 --> 21:48.420
Guess what? Bite me.

21:48.420 --> 21:52.420
Better insurance.

21:52.420 --> 21:56.420
I'll tell you, Bill, that I can't sit on the air.

21:56.420 --> 22:03.340
All right, so I'd like to talk here and lots of it you're gonna have to drink the thing that tastes like chalk and I

22:03.860 --> 22:09.320
Don't know no because they're testing my brain. I'm sure it'll be fine. You'll be fine

22:09.320 --> 22:15.320
I have a headache right now, too. I have the same headache that I have had since Friday the week before

22:16.960 --> 22:20.940
So I'm not very happy and they put me on stuff for migraines

22:21.120 --> 22:25.940
They should put a couple pills underneath her head so Neil. This is your brain

22:25.940 --> 22:34.060
brain, this is your brain on drugs. This doesn't even make sense. Her brain is on drugs, therefore

22:34.060 --> 22:37.780
when she's getting whatever, you know, a CAT scan or whatever. Oh, okay, I got it, with

22:37.780 --> 22:44.980
the egg, okay. I have a magnet that says, this is your brain, and then this is your

22:44.980 --> 22:53.660
brain with a piece of toast and bacon. I haven't gotten, you know, a little known fact, I actually

22:53.660 --> 22:57.600
collect fridge magnets I like to put them all over my fridge because they're

22:57.600 --> 23:00.760
awesome but not the poetry magnets those don't count because you know getting

23:00.760 --> 23:04.600
like 200 magnets with random words on them that's cheating so I like the real

23:04.600 --> 23:08.960
magnets and I haven't gotten a new one in a long time you know one of my

23:08.960 --> 23:12.480
favorite stores in the world I know there's one of them on Pier 39 in San

23:12.480 --> 23:15.360
Francisco is the the magnet town I don't even know what the hell the name of it

23:15.360 --> 23:18.200
is something like I'm sure one of our San Francisco listeners is gonna correct

23:18.200 --> 23:24.600
me but like magnet place or something I love that store it's awesome magnets are

23:24.600 --> 23:31.120
cool bumper stickers of my back to my broken brain oh sorry I think that our

23:31.120 --> 23:34.940
listeners are probably very amused if I found out what I was actually on they

23:34.940 --> 23:39.280
keep saying Vicodin I'm not on Vicodin I'm on something else that I'm not gonna

23:39.280 --> 23:43.920
tell you what I'm on but they would laugh because it's the last thing anyone

23:43.920 --> 23:49.760
ever expected me to be taken like pros actually ish I don't know I don't know

23:49.760 --> 23:56.160
it's actually called a triple whiskey shot awesome at least I wish that they

23:56.160 --> 23:59.320
have triple whiskey shots in the pill so you don't get the burn you just take the

23:59.320 --> 24:05.120
whiskey pill okay well I hope I hope you go to the doctor and and everything is

24:05.120 --> 24:08.960
is okay and they just find that they need to let the hamster out or something

24:08.960 --> 24:09.960
I don't know.

24:09.960 --> 24:12.960
Dude, if they gave me morphine, I'd be freaking happy.

24:12.960 --> 24:15.960
Alright, anything else you want to share about your week and your day?

24:15.960 --> 24:17.960
Um, I need a new job.

24:17.960 --> 24:18.960
Okay.

24:18.960 --> 24:20.960
Now hiring.

24:20.960 --> 24:22.960
Uh, Loki, how was your week?

24:22.960 --> 24:23.960
How was your day?

24:23.960 --> 24:26.960
My week was pretty good.

24:26.960 --> 24:36.960
Um, the entire week was basically filled with, um, work and plain death matches in, uh, Grand Theft Auto Liberty City Stories

24:36.960 --> 24:42.960
because my boss loves Grand Theft Auto, and so now instead of taking a 15 minute break

24:42.960 --> 24:48.200
and playing something, we go down into the theater and play four player multiplayer deathmatch

24:48.200 --> 24:53.240
on Grand Theft Auto Liberty City Stories and take a half an hour break. And it's okay because

24:53.240 --> 25:02.800
the boss is there too, so hell yeah. Do that twice a day. So, that was pretty fun. As promised,

25:02.800 --> 25:09.080
I have made sure to, um, you know, participate in the Biggest Loser thing, and I'm happy

25:09.080 --> 25:19.080
to say that I have eaten fast food every single day this week to meet my quota, and, um, yeah,

25:19.080 --> 25:21.420
other than that, really, um, not too much else.

25:21.420 --> 25:23.360
You've got heart problems!

25:23.360 --> 25:30.680
I'm fine. Shit. Um, I went and saw Saw II last night. I have to say, though, I was quite

25:30.680 --> 25:33.680
It wasn't as gory as I thought it would be.

25:33.680 --> 25:35.680
It really was a letdown.

25:35.680 --> 25:41.680
I mean, I don't know what everyone was saying. I was expecting, like, you know, fountains of blood.

25:41.680 --> 25:47.680
There is not even nearly enough blood in that, or gore, or anything.

25:47.680 --> 25:51.680
So, they really are going to have to impress me with a Saw III.

25:51.680 --> 25:53.680
And you know there's going to be a Saw III.

25:53.680 --> 25:55.680
Oh, yeah. Stupid bitch.

25:55.680 --> 26:03.180
They shouldn't have given the main guy cancer, or it should have been cancer that doesn't progress that fast or something like that, you know, magic cancer or something.

26:03.180 --> 26:07.680
I don't know. Try not to give away all the plot points of the movie in case some folks want to see it.

26:07.680 --> 26:11.680
He has cancer! Cancer!

26:11.680 --> 26:14.680
Yeah, whatever.

26:14.680 --> 26:19.680
Alright, anything else we want to share?

26:19.680 --> 26:21.680
No, really, no.

26:21.680 --> 26:22.680
Okay.

26:22.680 --> 26:25.680
Alright, uh, Angel, how was your week? How was your day?

26:25.680 --> 26:29.680
Mmm, good. Hang on.

26:31.680 --> 26:33.680
She was a salad and swallowing you.

26:33.680 --> 26:35.680
I mean, I'm just kidding.

26:35.680 --> 26:37.680
I'm very proud of Angel today.

26:37.680 --> 26:38.680
What?

26:38.680 --> 26:39.680
For eating a salad.

26:39.680 --> 26:41.680
Well, yeah.

26:41.680 --> 26:42.680
I'm very proud.

26:42.680 --> 26:48.680
See, we may have just said that X4 had to do it, but, uh, he's on.

26:48.680 --> 26:56.840
because I'm actually following the rules so we'll see how far this goes I've been

26:56.840 --> 27:01.100
I've been pretty good now I didn't agree to the no fast-food thing but I've only

27:01.100 --> 27:06.200
had fast food twice this week because I realized I did have it I had once today

27:06.200 --> 27:09.680
and once after last week's show so I've been averaging only once a week so

27:09.680 --> 27:12.680
that's not bad and when I go I don't supersize anything or whatever and I got

27:12.680 --> 27:16.880
a decent sandwich so I think I'm doing okay you know it's better than my like

27:16.880 --> 27:21.560
usually like three or four times a week so I'm good well feeling good for me

27:21.560 --> 27:25.020
like I didn't really know where the guidelines went for me I just kind of

27:25.020 --> 27:29.700
grabbed the mic last week and I was like uh does that mean I gotta do it too and

27:29.700 --> 27:36.860
you guys just kind of gave me that look I'm like fine you know so yeah I'm doing

27:36.860 --> 27:41.980
really good I have been staying away from fast food and regular soda and blah

27:41.980 --> 27:46.300
blah blah and all that other stuff and I only ate one piece of candy on Halloween

27:46.300 --> 27:48.300
so damn it be proud!

27:48.300 --> 27:49.300
Good job!

27:49.300 --> 27:52.300
What was the candy? What was the candy that broke ya?

27:52.300 --> 27:54.300
Um, I think probably candy corn!

27:54.300 --> 27:55.300
It's just evil!

27:55.300 --> 27:59.300
Actually, no, it was like the little tiny square piece of um,

27:59.300 --> 28:01.300
Snickers or something.

28:01.300 --> 28:03.300
Oh, one's not gonna kill ya. I mean, one's okay.

28:03.300 --> 28:05.300
It's just that you can't have one five times a day.

28:05.300 --> 28:08.300
And like, uh, little tiny vanilla Tootsie Roll.

28:08.300 --> 28:09.300
Aww.

28:09.300 --> 28:11.300
They're so good!

28:11.300 --> 28:12.300
Oh wait, it was Halloween.

28:12.300 --> 28:14.300
Everybody was allowed to cheat on Halloween, right?

28:14.300 --> 28:20.300
Yeah, but I just kind of started anyway. I was just like, eh, whatever. I'm gonna get used to it. I'm gonna have to get used to it, so...

28:20.300 --> 28:22.300
All is good.

28:22.300 --> 28:25.300
When's our next weigh-in? When are we gonna do a weigh-in and check on the progress?

28:25.300 --> 28:26.300
After the show?

28:26.300 --> 28:28.300
Oh, crap. I didn't know we were doing that.

28:28.300 --> 28:30.300
Wait, did I just say yay? Oh dear.

28:30.300 --> 28:31.300
How about we do it in the last take?

28:31.300 --> 28:33.300
Okay, we can do that.

28:33.300 --> 28:35.300
Is it left, right over, and now we're progressing?

28:35.300 --> 28:37.300
I have everything written down.

28:37.300 --> 28:38.300
Okay.

28:38.300 --> 28:40.300
But only you can see.

28:40.300 --> 28:44.300
But I have to, but I've got to actually make up the chart for everybody.

28:44.300 --> 28:46.300
Okay. Sounds good.

28:46.300 --> 28:48.300
I'll look forward to later in the show.

28:48.300 --> 28:51.300
Oh! You remember that little thing I kind of announced last week?

28:51.300 --> 28:54.300
Like, oh boy, let's hope I get it or whatever.

28:54.300 --> 28:55.300
Uh-huh.

28:55.300 --> 29:02.300
I got word back, and I opened my email on Thursday at...

29:02.300 --> 29:05.300
What time was it? Probably about 6.30.

29:05.300 --> 29:10.900
Congratulations, you're a member of the member advisory board, which is that little council

29:10.900 --> 29:12.820
I was talking about last week.

29:12.820 --> 29:16.220
So what exactly will you be doing as a part of that?

29:16.220 --> 29:23.380
Six month term, working closely with staff to advise on the community and pretty much

29:23.380 --> 29:24.380
NDA stuff.

29:24.380 --> 29:25.380
Cool.

29:25.380 --> 29:26.380
Okay.

29:26.380 --> 29:27.380
Very cool.

29:27.380 --> 29:28.380
All right.

29:28.380 --> 29:29.380
Let's see.

29:29.380 --> 29:30.540
My week and my day.

29:30.540 --> 29:32.340
I just had a long week.

29:32.340 --> 29:34.100
I did a lot, a lot of work this week.

29:34.100 --> 29:37.400
it's been a very exhausting week but good I mean in a good way you know I

29:37.400 --> 29:41.840
like my job and stuff so it's cool went out Friday night with the one and only

29:41.840 --> 29:46.640
dark soccer that was pretty cool because we went out to one of the local bars so

29:46.640 --> 29:50.900
we just kind of you know sat around we just we chilled I drink a lot yeah we

29:50.900 --> 29:55.240
watch people dance and I watched because I drove so I didn't get to really do I

29:55.240 --> 29:59.000
have my one drink when we got there because it's okay to have one drink as

29:59.000 --> 30:01.560
long as you provide yourself enough time for the drinks get out of your system

30:01.560 --> 30:06.760
him, which we did, because we were there a good two or three hours.

30:06.760 --> 30:11.520
But meanwhile, I watched DarkSakura drink, I don't know, like five different things,

30:11.520 --> 30:17.760
four or five different things, and she was pretty happy by the time we ended up going

30:17.760 --> 30:18.760
out to dinner.

30:18.760 --> 30:19.760
So it was a good time.

30:19.760 --> 30:24.760
And I was introducing somebody new to Jamie, who got to meet Jamie for the first time.

30:24.760 --> 30:27.000
So I'm sure he kind of got a kick out of that.

30:27.000 --> 30:29.440
No, he thought you were cool.

30:29.440 --> 30:34.820
And then, you know, that night, actually, this would be Friday night, we were watching

30:34.820 --> 30:36.980
Elimidate at my friend's house.

30:36.980 --> 30:37.980
Not Jamie.

30:37.980 --> 30:42.260
Jamie was at home in bed by this point, but we were watching Elimidate, and on the TV

30:42.260 --> 30:48.660
came a commercial, and it's the commercial featuring our very own Dark Sakura and Loki

30:48.660 --> 30:54.220
for the Guitar Hero story that's going to be on TV on Tuesday, and it's awesome.

30:54.220 --> 30:57.880
And it was just cool to see that during Elimidate, because I know that's like one of Loki's favorite

30:57.880 --> 30:58.880
shows.

30:58.880 --> 31:02.440
I thought Eliminate and Blind Date, because they're on back to back.

31:02.440 --> 31:04.040
I know you guys watch Blind Date.

31:04.040 --> 31:06.040
It was on during both shows, actually.

31:06.040 --> 31:07.040
So...

31:07.040 --> 31:08.040
Whatever.

31:08.040 --> 31:13.540
Anyway, we actually have that story.

31:13.540 --> 31:14.540
So we're going to...

31:14.540 --> 31:16.040
Not the story, but we have a little promo.

31:16.040 --> 31:23.520
I just want to play it for our listeners here, so they can hear Dark Sakura's quote that

31:23.520 --> 31:26.420
will be in the news story, because it's pretty funny.

31:26.420 --> 31:28.640
So let's see here if we can get this to play.

31:28.640 --> 31:35.040
a little bit of movie time here on Orange Launch Radio. Loading, loading, loading, come

31:35.040 --> 31:37.640
on. Here we go.

31:37.640 --> 31:40.640
Tuesday on WB58 News at Ten.

31:40.640 --> 31:43.640
It feels like playing an actual guitar.

31:43.640 --> 31:46.640
Get the rush of rocking out for an audience right in your own living room.

31:46.640 --> 31:48.640
I love the remote, so I play that one and be sedated.

31:48.640 --> 31:51.640
There's a fun new way to make your musical dreams a reality.

31:51.640 --> 31:54.640
You're actually creating music and playing in front of a crowd.

31:54.640 --> 31:58.640
Find out why this rockin' new game could be a big hit this holiday season.

31:58.640 --> 32:00.640
People of all ages are really getting into this.

32:00.640 --> 32:04.640
Tuesday on WV58 News at 10.

32:04.640 --> 32:13.640
I love how in that promo there's like one shot of Loki for like two, not even a second.

32:13.640 --> 32:17.640
There's just like a shot of Loki going, no, no, no, the guitar and that's it.

32:17.640 --> 32:21.640
It was the equivalent of Loki's foot basically being in the new story.

32:21.640 --> 32:23.640
So it's great. And what else is new?

32:23.640 --> 32:27.160
This seems to have a neat thing where I nod my head.

32:27.160 --> 32:31.280
I think that's cool that Dark Sakura is talking about their emotes.

32:31.280 --> 32:34.400
That kind of amused me when I saw that on TV.

32:34.400 --> 32:39.600
Anyway, we posted a link to that on the website, and of course Tuesday night is when the story

32:39.600 --> 32:42.200
is going to air, and we will hopefully have something.

32:42.200 --> 32:46.080
I'm thinking the news stations, because it looks like they put a lot of their news stories

32:46.080 --> 32:48.980
on the website, so I'm thinking the news station might actually put it on their website, which

32:48.980 --> 32:52.280
would certainly make it easier for us to share it with all of you, because if they put the

32:52.280 --> 32:56.080
promo up there they'll put the story up there and then hopefully we'll have so

32:56.080 --> 33:02.200
much fun 2.0 so excited I hope you know I'm guessing they're not even gonna let

33:02.200 --> 33:07.080
me say anything that's probably the guy in the background so what do you think

33:07.080 --> 33:11.240
about this game it and then they'll just cut away you know what's great is my

33:11.240 --> 33:16.200
ignition pad is over there and it's in the background of one of the shots so my

33:16.200 --> 33:19.720
My ignition pad got more screen time than you did.

33:19.720 --> 33:25.120
My Konami guitars are out because we've been playing guitar freakin' before.

33:25.120 --> 33:26.120
Right on.

33:26.120 --> 33:29.080
And the Joe Mania set was out.

33:29.080 --> 33:30.080
Awesome.

33:30.080 --> 33:34.380
So, anyway, let's talk about Guitar Hero a little bit, because I finally managed to pick

33:34.380 --> 33:36.020
up the game this week.

33:36.020 --> 33:39.840
I picked up Guitar Hero, and I've been playing the shit out of it since yesterday when I

33:39.840 --> 33:40.960
got it.

33:40.960 --> 33:42.660
It's really great.

33:42.660 --> 33:47.780
I was really surprised, considering that, you know, the last game Red Octane put out

33:47.780 --> 33:49.480
I wasn't too impressed with.

33:49.480 --> 33:55.820
This one, being done by Harmonix, is so wonderful, and it really makes me hopeful for whatever

33:55.820 --> 34:00.060
Red Octane is going to do in the future, maybe going to some other types of music.

34:00.060 --> 34:04.340
I think the music game community is going to win big if this game does well, and a lot

34:04.340 --> 34:08.380
of early reviews for this game have great scores.

34:08.380 --> 34:12.300
Like I think GameSpot gave it a great review, I know 1UP.com gave it a perfect 10, was a

34:12.300 --> 34:17.160
9.2 out of 10 that's higher than a lot of DDR games get so that's I think what

34:17.160 --> 34:22.020
people are really liking about the game is it's very accessible so it's it's it

34:22.020 --> 34:26.960
is it's a fun game my friend came over yesterday for our stargate marathon and

34:26.960 --> 34:32.060
she was I was playing a game while she was making pancakes awesome and holy

34:32.060 --> 34:37.020
pancakes really yummy and I was playing just a couple of stuff she's like oh my

34:37.020 --> 34:41.120
god they got their original sounds like no no the cover songs are that good

34:41.120 --> 34:43.120
But the covers are really good.

34:43.120 --> 34:46.120
They went to a great length to duplicate the effects.

34:46.120 --> 34:47.120
Yeah, they did.

34:47.120 --> 34:52.620
I mean, some of them, like the Franz Ferdinand song that I kind of like, is in their sounds,

34:52.620 --> 34:53.620
just like the original.

34:53.620 --> 34:55.920
And like Iron Man sounds great.

34:55.920 --> 34:58.000
Some of them aren't exact, but they're close enough.

34:58.000 --> 35:00.000
They're closer than any Karaoke Revolution I think has been.

35:00.000 --> 35:01.720
I was freaking playing Thundercat 65.

35:01.720 --> 35:02.720
That was cool.

35:02.720 --> 35:03.720
Yeah, it's awesome.

35:03.720 --> 35:04.720
It's got a great song.

35:04.720 --> 35:09.120
My only kind of boo-hoo part is that there's not more songs playable at the very start

35:09.120 --> 35:13.120
because yesterday, you know, I had some people over, we were wanting to play Guitar Freaks,

35:13.120 --> 35:20.080
or Guitar Freaks Guitar Hero, whoops, we wanted to play Guitar Hero, and there was

35:20.080 --> 35:23.440
very little available at the very beginning of the game, so it's kind of like we actually

35:23.440 --> 35:28.920
had to play a little bit to get some songs, so that was kind of a eh, but, you know, it

35:28.920 --> 35:33.320
didn't take that long before we started opening more stuff, so.

35:33.320 --> 35:36.320
They should let us pick the songs for the next game.

35:36.320 --> 35:39.080
Seriously, where's Freebird?

35:39.080 --> 35:40.580
You think so? No Freebird!

35:40.580 --> 35:41.580
I want Freebird!

35:41.580 --> 35:43.080
They need to have Freebird in the sequel.

35:43.080 --> 35:45.080
No Freebird and no Stairway to Heaven!

35:45.080 --> 35:49.580
They need Freebird, and they need Stairway, and they need, um...

35:49.580 --> 35:50.080
Blur.

35:51.080 --> 35:53.580
I was gonna say Sweet Home Alabama, but I guess we already have...

35:53.580 --> 35:54.080
Blur.

35:54.080 --> 35:56.080
Um, sure, we can have Blur.

35:56.080 --> 35:59.580
Metallica? Like Old Metallica, not New Sellout Metallica?

36:01.080 --> 36:02.080
Metallica.

36:02.080 --> 36:19.080
I want to get some really hard rock stuff in here like you know I'm gonna get some metal like even get some filter in there you know some of that stuff even you know even though they've kind of dissolved as a band gravity kills would be fucking awesome because they just had really

36:19.080 --> 36:21.480
really good guitar sections in the whole stuff.

36:21.480 --> 36:26.080
See, that and Rammstein. Rammstein had tons of really good guitar sections in their songs.

36:26.080 --> 36:28.080
We need Guns N' Roses.

36:28.080 --> 36:30.780
Yeah, we need Welcome to the Jungle. I'm sorry.

36:30.780 --> 36:33.980
Welcome to the Jungle, man, welcome to the jungle.

36:33.980 --> 36:37.880
I hope they link up to a later game. I hope they decide to do a drum game.

36:37.880 --> 36:40.280
I mean, I guess that would be too similar. But maybe hook up...

36:40.280 --> 36:43.180
Well, I guess they can't even hook up to Karaoke Revolution because it's another company.

36:43.180 --> 36:44.980
But somehow hook up to another music...

36:44.980 --> 36:46.180
Me too!

36:46.180 --> 36:51.740
You know what Red Octane should revive is keyboard games.

36:51.740 --> 36:55.780
They should launch a keyboard game that would be badass.

36:55.780 --> 37:00.020
Expensive but fun.

37:00.020 --> 37:02.500
Van Halen would be awesome too.

37:02.500 --> 37:06.380
A lot of great suggestions there in our chat room. www.orangelaunchradio.com

37:06.380 --> 37:08.980
Click on chat.

37:08.980 --> 37:13.500
Like a song that needs to be in the next Guitar Hero? I'm down for that.

37:13.500 --> 37:14.380
We're going to do that.

37:14.380 --> 37:17.740
Alright, so we'll be prepared for that a little later in the show.

37:17.740 --> 37:20.840
What else I wanted to say about Guitar Hero though, you know what my favorite thing about

37:20.840 --> 37:22.100
Guitar Hero?

37:22.100 --> 37:24.020
Is the art direction.

37:24.020 --> 37:29.860
The art, and like the sets, and the little like, just like there's little jokes that

37:29.860 --> 37:33.500
make the cold game go, like when you're loading and going to a new stage it shows it turning

37:33.500 --> 37:34.500
up to 11.

37:34.500 --> 37:39.060
You know that's the female guitarist, with the short black and red hair, who is actually

37:39.060 --> 37:40.420
modeled off of a real person.

37:40.420 --> 37:41.420
Really?

37:41.420 --> 37:42.860
Aren't they all supposed to be modeled off real people?

37:42.860 --> 37:45.980
Well, I know there's like the Keith Richards clone that I just sort of freaked out over

37:45.980 --> 37:50.060
because the first time I saw him pop up was with a flying V. I was like, it's my dog!

37:50.060 --> 37:51.060
Yeah.

37:51.060 --> 37:52.060
Nerd moment!

37:52.060 --> 37:56.620
And, yeah, I just, the art direction of the game isn't, like the little pictures drawn

37:56.620 --> 38:00.060
on the notebook, like they even have a unicorn drawn on the notebook, which made me think

38:00.060 --> 38:04.700
of, anyway, I forget it, um, but the art direction of the game is great.

38:04.700 --> 38:11.620
And there's just all these, I like the way it's set up, like it's different than a Bomani

38:11.620 --> 38:12.620
game.

38:12.620 --> 38:15.620
Really? Why is that just the ISO perspective thing?

38:15.620 --> 38:18.620
Yeah. And the way it's moving? That's too bad.

38:18.620 --> 38:21.620
I like the way it's set up. It's not like a Bomani game.

38:21.620 --> 38:24.620
Because, you know, in most Bomani games, it's like, walk up, play, walk away.

38:24.620 --> 38:31.620
And even on the home versions, until Extreme 2's mission mode, or whatever the hell it was called,

38:31.620 --> 38:37.620
until Extreme 2's thing, most of the DDR home games and most 2DX and Beatmania guitar freaks,

38:37.620 --> 38:40.620
it's just walk up, play your songs, walk away.

38:40.620 --> 38:42.620
The music is not nitty.

38:42.620 --> 38:43.620
Well, that's true too.

38:43.620 --> 38:44.620
That is awesome.

38:44.620 --> 38:47.620
I'm talking about the setup, the way the game is presented.

38:47.620 --> 38:50.620
Like, you know how in DDR, it's walk up, play your songs, walk away.

38:50.620 --> 38:54.620
I like how Guitar Hero kind of has that setup, like the career mode.

38:54.620 --> 38:56.620
And it's like, you know, oh, we're going to play at the house.

38:56.620 --> 39:00.620
And then you get the review in the newspaper, and it shows the newspaper with the rating.

39:00.620 --> 39:02.620
That's why it breaks out.

39:02.620 --> 39:06.620
And then it shows the bill with your manager's cut, and the food cut, and the bribery cuts,

39:06.620 --> 39:08.620
and all that stuff, leaving you with so much money.

39:08.620 --> 39:13.420
so much money. All that little stuff goes a long way in amusing me greatly, and that's

39:13.420 --> 39:17.300
important to amuse me greatly. So the way the game is presented, it's not the same even

39:17.300 --> 39:21.340
as amplitude and frequency, because amplitude and frequency is almost walk up, player songs

39:21.340 --> 39:26.680
walk away. The way the Guitar Hero is set up is cool, and is part of what makes that

39:26.680 --> 39:32.700
game so great, and stand out so much differently than Guitar Freaks. Honestly, Guitar Heroes

39:32.700 --> 39:37.800
and Guitar Freaks are very different games. Yes, they both use guitar controllers, but

39:37.800 --> 39:40.920
You've got Guitar Hero has five buttons, which changes things completely.

39:40.920 --> 39:42.600
And the whammy bar!

39:42.600 --> 39:43.600
And the whammy bar!

39:43.600 --> 39:44.600
Absolutely.

39:44.600 --> 39:46.160
I was wailing hard, okay?

39:46.160 --> 39:51.480
The way you turn your guitar up, the wailing thing, like in Guitar Freaks it was called

39:51.480 --> 39:56.120
a wailing bonus, it's done like strategy-wise in Guitar Hero.

39:56.120 --> 40:00.280
Like you want to tilt your guitar up at a certain time to maximize your score.

40:00.280 --> 40:03.840
Like they put a little thought into, okay, what could the guitar tilts do?

40:03.840 --> 40:06.880
And then it also changes the animation on screen so your guy just starts going fucking

40:06.880 --> 40:11.320
nuts like spinning guitars around and stuff. One thing I do sort of miss is it was in Guitar

40:11.320 --> 40:18.320
Freaks with the hidden notes. Where if you, you know, managed to find the hidden notes,

40:18.320 --> 40:23.720
it would just pop up a whole new set of notes. Or the open picks. Yeah. But still, I mean,

40:23.720 --> 40:28.420
Guitar Hero has... You should get freestyle points. Oh, like a freestyle mode? Yeah. Well,

40:28.420 --> 40:32.480
Guitar Hero still has a long way to go, too. I mean, this is just the first release, and

40:32.480 --> 40:36.620
kind of hope that there'll be more releases of this in the future and I

40:36.620 --> 40:39.320
think I think this game has the potential to do very well I know I

40:39.320 --> 40:42.040
bought the last copy of Best Buy yesterday so that means they're already

40:42.040 --> 40:47.800
selling out and I got mine right when the shipment arrived at our game stop

40:47.800 --> 40:55.660
right low-key oops I was going to mention that the

40:55.660 --> 41:00.640
game's not even supposed to be out yet but technically but actually I'm going to go

41:00.640 --> 41:06.640
So I wouldn't say officially it had no street date on any of their ship packages, therefore it could be released as they do.

41:06.640 --> 41:15.640
Well yeah, I mean, games don't really have street dates, but the whole thing was they were not supposed to be shipping until Tuesday anyways, so a lot of the stuff's early.

41:15.640 --> 41:22.640
I think that's kind of one of those things, they did it in the groove the very same way, like it didn't really have an official release date, it was just, you know, we're going to ship it out whenever you get it.

41:22.640 --> 41:25.640
We got it pressed faster than we thought we would, so here you go.

41:25.640 --> 41:26.640
So that's cool.

41:26.640 --> 41:30.640
I mean, so it's out there now if you guys want to look around, but probably Tuesday,

41:30.640 --> 41:33.520
Wednesday is when you're really going to start seeing this game out there just about everywhere.

41:33.520 --> 41:35.320
And I think it has the potential to do very well.

41:35.320 --> 41:38.760
I thought it was interesting, and I remember bringing this up on the show before about

41:38.760 --> 41:43.480
the MTV partnership with the game, but I kind of forgot about it until I booted up the game

41:43.480 --> 41:45.080
and saw the MTV logo.

41:45.080 --> 41:48.840
And even though MTV kind of sucks, I think the partnership is going to be great exposure

41:48.840 --> 41:49.840
for the game.

41:49.840 --> 41:55.000
And what's really cool about the game is that all the unlocked songs are unsigned bands

41:55.000 --> 41:58.760
with a real song like the people that won the Be A Guitar Hero contest

41:58.760 --> 42:01.920
and you know, littler bands, I guess I shouldn't say unsigned, but more

42:01.920 --> 42:06.720
littler, not-so-hurt bands. The only band in there I'd really heard of before was

42:06.720 --> 42:08.160
Freeze Pop

42:08.160 --> 42:12.600
because they have a song in there that you unlock and it's badass. I love the Freeze Pop song.

42:12.600 --> 42:14.080
Get ready to rock.

42:14.080 --> 42:16.200
It's great.

42:16.200 --> 42:18.240
So anyway, I definitely give a

42:18.240 --> 42:21.760
glowing review to Guitar Hero. I think it's fabulous and you all should go buy it if you want to

42:21.760 --> 42:25.320
play guitar game. The price tag is a little bit high, so maybe they'll come down in price

42:25.320 --> 42:30.480
after Christmas, and maybe it would be a better time to get it, but it's great. It's so much

42:30.480 --> 42:37.480
fun. Any other thoughts on guitar hero? No, we'll talk a little...oh, Angel.

42:38.200 --> 42:44.640
I like how the notes at the bottom of the screen, like the colors for the notes, because

42:44.640 --> 42:49.480
it obviously goes with the buttons, but they're bright on the screen, so for me, it'll be

42:49.480 --> 42:56.480
easier to play since I am color and shape oriented. Well, you guys knew that, but yeah,

42:56.840 --> 43:03.840
so it'll be easier for me to play, and for those that have difficulty like I do, well,

43:04.600 --> 43:08.480
it'll be a good thing, so I can't wait to pick it up! Ah!

43:08.480 --> 43:14.480
Alright, sounds good. Yeah, it's very bright, and all the colors stand out. It's very nice.

43:14.480 --> 43:18.440
I can see it! Very nice. Basically, the way it's set up, just imagine

43:18.440 --> 43:22.080
its frequency or amplitude except you don't move around the tube it's just the

43:22.080 --> 43:25.920
ISO view of the notes coming at you which sometimes can be a little bit

43:25.920 --> 43:29.320
bothersome though because you can't see the notes as far in advance and for me

43:29.320 --> 43:33.120
I'm really big on noticing the measures like in guitar freaks you can see the

43:33.120 --> 43:36.520
little lines that show you the measures but in guitar hero it's harder to see

43:36.520 --> 43:40.720
those lines and judge because it's at an ISO perspective so it's kind of I don't

43:40.720 --> 43:43.960
know it's kind of tricky but those are really minor minor complaints I would

43:43.960 --> 43:47.400
hope that in a later version you could maybe change that like tilt the

43:47.400 --> 43:50.700
perspective to something that works better for me like that would be great

43:50.700 --> 43:54.000
if you could freely rotate the perspective I'm sure it's possible but

43:54.000 --> 43:56.980
that's a very minor complaint in the scope of things honestly it's a great

43:56.980 --> 44:03.740
first release a lot of promising things kick-ass song list I love it it's great

44:03.740 --> 44:07.500
all right so I think what we'll do is we go to a break and we come back from

44:07.500 --> 44:10.860
break we're going to talk a little bit about I want to talk about DDR Mario mix

44:10.860 --> 44:15.940
for a minute and then we're also going to do tonight's list lists about guitar

44:15.940 --> 44:20.280
guitar hero. We haven't done listless in a long time, so that'll be cool. Now, unfortunately,

44:20.280 --> 44:25.460
I don't have any music from Guitar Hero yet. I only have guitar freaks. But since we're

44:25.460 --> 44:30.480
in a guitar-shaking mood right now, we have to, I guess, take a moment to recognize some

44:30.480 --> 44:34.420
guitar freaks. So we'll be back after this. Maybe we'll have some Guitar Hero music later

44:34.420 --> 44:38.480
on. We're gonna try and rip some of the music from it. The songs are very long. Like, there's

44:38.480 --> 44:41.560
some songs in there. Yeah, they're like five-minute-long songs.

44:41.560 --> 44:45.560
I think I'm playing Smoke on the Water.

44:45.560 --> 44:49.560
My hand is about to fall off.

44:49.560 --> 44:53.560
This song's long. It's like seven minutes.

44:53.560 --> 44:56.560
We'll be back after this with more Orange Lounge Radio.

44:56.560 --> 44:59.560
I guess we'll start off this break with a little bit of...

44:59.560 --> 45:01.560
We'll start off with a classic Guitar Freaks tune.

45:01.560 --> 45:04.040
We'll be back after this with more Orange Lounge Radio.

46:31.560 --> 46:59.560
Now get an eight niner to scramble I got my car all set to scramble

46:59.560 --> 47:02.560
Don't really know where I'm from, so

47:02.560 --> 47:04.560
I've been put down on the pedal

47:04.560 --> 47:07.560
I've got pedals to the metal

47:07.560 --> 47:11.560
Rolled down the highway just like a fireball

47:11.560 --> 47:15.560
Turned my concealer so loud there's a fireball burnin' out of control

47:15.560 --> 47:20.560
Ain't no tornado, so smile over the sky like I can't move

47:22.560 --> 47:23.560
Yes, I can

47:23.560 --> 47:47.560
This is my transition, nuclear fission, minimal role

47:47.560 --> 47:51.560
I need a guy to beat a fireball, burning powder to go

47:51.560 --> 47:55.560
God has to live his every way, but that is in our own

47:55.560 --> 47:59.560
Speaking and his spirit's far off, we have to go

48:00.560 --> 48:01.560
I'm gonna getcha!

48:01.560 --> 48:08.560
It's great, man!

51:01.560 --> 51:31.240
Baby do you want the juice, baby do you want it, baby do you want the juice, baby do you

51:31.240 --> 51:52.920
We're back here kids on Orange Lounge Radio and we're just trekking on along here after

51:52.920 --> 51:54.480
that Guitar Freaks break.

51:54.480 --> 51:59.860
We were checking out during the break some folks in our chat room posted that some websites

51:59.860 --> 52:05.380
out there have leaked some new Beatmania screenshots, screens from the brand new Beatmania game,

52:05.380 --> 52:09.460
and I totally missed this. I guess these were actually released earlier in the week. But

52:09.460 --> 52:13.940
very interesting, some of these screenshots. Maybe I missed this before, if this was previously

52:13.940 --> 52:18.720
announced, but I noticed one of these screens shows the free scratching zone deal, which

52:18.720 --> 52:25.180
kind of looks like, it looks like the freeze notes in the seventh mix in the final that

52:25.180 --> 52:26.180
they had, but they're not quite...

52:26.180 --> 52:29.180
No, this is something way back from Five Key.

52:29.180 --> 52:31.180
I don't remember the free scratching zone.

52:31.180 --> 52:34.180
Yeah, this has been in there since even Beat Media 2.

52:34.180 --> 52:36.180
God, I totally don't remember them.

52:36.180 --> 52:40.180
Okay, well that's cool. I forgot about them.

52:40.180 --> 52:42.180
How often do they use them in songs?

52:42.180 --> 52:43.180
Not very.

52:43.180 --> 52:49.180
The Five Key game I probably played the most of was Beat Media 6 Mix and Core, that release,

52:49.180 --> 52:51.180
and I don't remember seeing this in there.

52:51.180 --> 52:54.180
There was like a couple songs, a handful.

52:54.180 --> 53:01.180
Very interesting purple-y interface there, and also, by the way, which shows that V is in the game,

53:01.180 --> 53:05.180
but that shouldn't be a big shock to anybody that V is going to turn up in Beat Media USA.

53:05.180 --> 53:06.180
Why not? It's been like every other...

53:06.180 --> 53:10.180
Every Japanese release since 5th, every single one.

53:10.180 --> 53:13.180
Did you know that 10th Style is only like a few days away?

53:13.180 --> 53:16.180
It's not that far. I think 10th Style is like 10 days away, somebody was telling me.

53:16.180 --> 53:18.180
Crazy.

53:18.180 --> 53:22.180
So Beat Media is very purple. It's a very different interface.

53:22.180 --> 53:26.180
I can appreciate that they're doing something new with it, not just, you know, cloning a

53:26.180 --> 53:30.100
Japanese release and taking out some songs and putting in different ones.

53:30.100 --> 53:35.100
It makes the game feel very much like ours, even if you don't care for purple or don't

53:35.100 --> 53:38.100
really care for the interface, at least it's something a little different.

53:38.100 --> 53:39.100
Analogy?

53:39.100 --> 53:40.100
Sure.

53:40.100 --> 53:42.100
That's what I thought.

53:42.100 --> 53:47.740
Anyway, so if you want to check those out, it looks like oneof.com has posted some of

53:47.740 --> 53:50.620
those screenshots, but I'm sure they've made their way around the internet.

53:50.620 --> 53:55.580
check your favorite Game News Wire site, and I'm sure you can check out some more of those

53:55.580 --> 53:57.580
pictures for yourself.

53:57.580 --> 53:59.820
All right.

53:59.820 --> 54:04.520
I think what we'll do now, before we get to List List, because I don't think everyone's

54:04.520 --> 54:09.220
quite ready to go yet, I think what maybe we'll do is we'll go to the Skype line and

54:09.220 --> 54:15.500
take some telephone calls on the Skype line, www.orangelaunchradio.com, and click on Interact

54:15.500 --> 54:22.380
with us if you would like to get more information about how you can call the program. You can

54:22.380 --> 54:27.940
either use your computer using a program called Skype, or you can actually use our brand new

54:27.940 --> 54:32.980
phone number, which I don't remember off the top of my head, but it's posted on the website.

54:32.980 --> 54:35.340
But the phone's already ringing. I don't need to give out that phone number. We're going

54:35.340 --> 54:38.060
to go right to a call. So, hello, you're on Orange Lawn's radio.

54:38.060 --> 54:41.300
Hey, Skye, I'm Ziggy here. Hey, Ziggy, how you doing?

54:41.300 --> 54:44.180
uh... but i thought that they did right now

54:44.180 --> 54:45.640
you were right

54:45.640 --> 54:47.140
a little bit and

54:47.140 --> 54:49.020
anticipated like that

54:49.020 --> 54:49.980
because uh...

54:49.980 --> 54:52.500
ten days left beat me to the extent

54:52.500 --> 54:53.660
i'll see it

54:53.660 --> 54:56.540
that's right you tell me about this before the show that we we don't have

54:56.540 --> 54:59.880
much longer to go before ten thousand we out that's awesome

54:59.880 --> 55:03.340
yeah well i got a little news about ten thousand yes for those who haven't

55:03.340 --> 55:04.900
caught up with it yet

55:04.900 --> 55:06.140
but yeah what's that

55:06.140 --> 55:10.740
two happy sky songs have been confirmed by ten thousand yes

55:10.740 --> 55:11.960
what's that

55:11.960 --> 55:15.040
that uh... lesson five and under the sky

55:15.040 --> 55:19.420
awesome so um... that we get a little so that we don't just get one we get to

55:19.420 --> 55:21.700
happy sky songs that's good news

55:21.700 --> 55:25.420
so far there have been a twenty four unconfirmed songs yet

55:25.420 --> 55:27.120
no really

55:27.120 --> 55:30.760
probably until this thursday we walk we won't be seeing the uh... you know

55:30.760 --> 55:34.100
economy's gonna reveal the uh... entire complete song list

55:34.100 --> 55:35.900
hopefully by this thursday

55:35.900 --> 55:38.660
well yeah i think if the game comes out very soon

55:38.660 --> 55:40.260
all those songs of course

55:40.260 --> 55:44.020
you know by l.e.d.

55:44.020 --> 55:46.860
it's all v it's all remixes of v

55:46.860 --> 55:51.540
yeah v has been confirmed for beat me in the u.s.

55:51.540 --> 55:55.940
not a big surprise though honestly not a big surprise to me either

55:55.940 --> 55:58.600
so in fact if v hadn't have been there

55:58.600 --> 56:01.200
you know people would have complained

56:01.200 --> 56:04.100
where's v? why did they put v in there?

56:04.100 --> 56:06.380
konami hates us konami hates america

56:06.380 --> 56:08.380
coming out of the u.s.a.

56:08.380 --> 56:10.580
why did they put my fucking video in there?

56:10.580 --> 56:12.100
so

56:12.100 --> 56:14.040
you know that's how it would have been

56:14.040 --> 56:15.220
yeah

56:15.220 --> 56:16.460
uh...

56:16.460 --> 56:20.520
talking about uh... other stuff uh... well you haven't premiered the uh...

56:20.520 --> 56:24.980
motsu moto go the goalie allies bonus track yet right no i i keep meaning to

56:24.980 --> 56:28.880
and i always forget to uh... play it but it's it's a great so i love the video

56:28.880 --> 56:32.340
the video is very cool i really love the video too and i'm hoping that this song is going to be

56:32.340 --> 56:35.420
on the tenth style cds you know as a bonus song

56:35.420 --> 56:38.020
it might that'd be cool

56:38.020 --> 56:41.460
if those who should i reveal it now or uh... sure do it

56:41.460 --> 56:42.900
okay

56:42.900 --> 56:46.040
here's from the uh... gory allies bonus track

56:46.040 --> 56:50.060
here's uh... taro with al-farsi r about i think it is going to name it all but i

56:50.060 --> 56:54.180
had actually played a lot of not about that

56:54.180 --> 56:58.080
after all we can play will play uh... how long is that i don't know what it is

56:58.080 --> 57:00.760
about two minutes uh... forty five second but i thought that while we go

57:00.760 --> 57:03.260
ahead and play that um... i gotta get it though here we go

57:03.260 --> 57:04.780
okay so here it is well okay

57:04.780 --> 57:10.180
from the top. Introduce it again. Here's the Golielek's bonus track and

57:10.180 --> 57:14.100
Tarah with Al-Farshir. And for those in the studio, you can see the video if you want.

57:14.100 --> 57:15.100
It's pretty cool.

59:15.100 --> 59:17.100
You

59:45.100 --> 59:52.540
Now, that song is pretty badass, I gotta say. It's a really good song, and I do hope that

59:52.540 --> 59:55.220
song does turn up in Ten Style's one of the hidden tracks, because it's great. And the

59:55.220 --> 59:58.580
video's great, too. Like, you know, we're kind of sitting here in the studio watching

59:58.580 --> 01:00:01.940
it, and I'm hearing, ooh, I need an LJ, how can I do that? Ooh, I need to cosplay that.

01:00:01.940 --> 01:00:06.220
I need to do this. So it's got a nice video. I like the setup. For those who weren't able

01:00:06.220 --> 01:00:12.020
to see the video, it basically is kind of like this epic battle with all the 2DX characters.

01:00:12.020 --> 01:00:14.020
That's kind of what it is, it looks like.

01:00:14.020 --> 01:00:15.020
Yeah.

01:00:15.020 --> 01:00:17.020
It's like a bit from Eden.

01:00:17.020 --> 01:00:18.020
Yeah.

01:00:18.020 --> 01:00:27.020
And some just, like, Lilith is, you know, I mean, Siren is dying on Lilith's arms.

01:00:27.020 --> 01:00:28.020
Mm-hmm.

01:00:28.020 --> 01:00:31.020
And then, you know, for those who haven't seen the, for those who haven't watched the

01:00:31.020 --> 01:00:39.020
video yet, and then in the end, like, it's Erica and Shiloh, like, in each other's arms.

01:00:39.020 --> 01:00:41.020
Yeah, it's a neat video.

01:00:41.020 --> 01:00:45.020
If you're into the 2DX characters and the artwork behind it, it's just a great video

01:00:45.020 --> 01:00:46.220
that compliments it very well.

01:00:46.220 --> 01:00:49.620
So thank you for reminding us to check that out, because it's a pretty cool one.

01:00:49.620 --> 01:00:50.620
So thank you.

01:00:50.620 --> 01:00:51.620
And no problem.

01:00:51.620 --> 01:00:52.620
All right.

01:00:52.620 --> 01:00:55.220
Well, anything else you want to share with our listeners?

01:00:55.220 --> 01:00:56.420
Well, nothing much else.

01:00:56.420 --> 01:01:00.340
Hopefully when I get my copy of Tensa, I will give you the details.

01:01:00.340 --> 01:01:01.340
All right.

01:01:01.340 --> 01:01:02.340
Sounds good.

01:01:02.340 --> 01:01:03.340
We'll be looking forward to hearing it.

01:01:03.340 --> 01:01:04.340
Yeah.

01:01:04.340 --> 01:01:05.340
All right.

01:01:05.340 --> 01:01:06.340
Take care, buddy.

01:01:06.340 --> 01:01:07.340
Have a good one.

01:01:07.340 --> 01:01:08.340
Later.

01:01:08.340 --> 01:01:09.340
Later.

01:01:09.340 --> 01:01:15.340
Okay, um, we're gonna go to another call now here on the Skyline, and we'll see what this person wants.

01:01:15.340 --> 01:01:17.340
Hello, you're on Orange Lawn's radio.

01:01:18.340 --> 01:01:19.340
Guys there?

01:01:19.340 --> 01:01:21.340
Yes, we're here. Can you hear me?

01:01:21.340 --> 01:01:23.340
We can kinda hear you. What's up?

01:01:23.340 --> 01:01:26.340
Uh, not much. I'm eating Doritos.

01:01:26.340 --> 01:01:29.340
You're eating Doritos again, huh? How you doin'?

01:01:29.340 --> 01:01:32.340
Uh, I got nachos this time.

01:01:32.340 --> 01:01:34.340
I'm sorry?

01:01:34.340 --> 01:01:36.340
We got nacho cheese this time.

01:01:36.340 --> 01:01:40.180
this time nacho cheese this time i what's on your mind

01:01:40.180 --> 01:01:41.980
uh...

01:01:41.980 --> 01:01:44.300
i really hope for mario kart ds

01:01:44.300 --> 01:01:47.140
you're hyped for mario kart ds i'm really hyped for this too i think it's

01:01:47.140 --> 01:01:48.520
going to be awesome to you

01:01:48.520 --> 01:01:53.460
be able to play people across the uh... internet and all that stuff

01:01:53.460 --> 01:01:56.380
news video i just saw it

01:01:56.380 --> 01:01:58.060
was it twenty five minutes

01:01:58.060 --> 01:01:59.140
just

01:01:59.140 --> 01:02:01.460
bunch of stuff

01:02:01.460 --> 01:02:02.420
crazy

01:02:02.420 --> 01:02:06.420
So, um, this game's out, what, like a week from Tuesday or something?

01:02:06.420 --> 01:02:10.420
It's out, um, yeah. It's the week of the 14th?

01:02:10.420 --> 01:02:11.420
Sometime during that week.

01:02:11.420 --> 01:02:12.420
That's the date.

01:02:12.420 --> 01:02:15.420
I'm excited for it. It's gonna be a good time.

01:02:15.420 --> 01:02:16.420
Yeah.

01:02:16.420 --> 01:02:21.420
So, um, and now I hear you can have, like, up to 50 people on your friends list or something through the game?

01:02:21.420 --> 01:02:23.420
Uh, I don't know. They didn't say that.

01:02:23.420 --> 01:02:25.420
It's only four players, though, over the Internet.

01:02:25.420 --> 01:02:27.420
Well, I'm not too surprised by that,

01:02:27.420 --> 01:02:30.420
because eight people would be an awful lot of bandwidth to have going everywhere.

01:02:30.420 --> 01:02:35.420
Yeah, you don't want all that lag and stuff.

01:02:35.420 --> 01:02:38.420
Any other games coming out soon that you're looking forward to?

01:02:38.420 --> 01:02:43.420
You still have to give Midway Arcade Treasures 3 and DDR Mario Mix.

01:02:43.420 --> 01:02:50.420
Midway Arcade Treasures 3 is pretty good. It's a pretty solid game, if you like racing games.

01:02:50.420 --> 01:02:55.420
If you're waiting for more Midway Arcade stuff for the PSP,

01:02:55.420 --> 01:03:00.040
Arcade Treasures extended play is coming out in December which is going to have a

01:03:00.040 --> 01:03:02.560
bunch of the old stuff plus Mortal Kombat 1 and 2.

01:03:02.560 --> 01:03:06.280
Very cool. I know about that. Very cool.

01:03:06.280 --> 01:03:09.840
Alright, anything else you want to share with our listeners?

01:03:09.840 --> 01:03:13.060
Oh yeah, I got a link to this one site. There's this guy

01:03:13.060 --> 01:03:16.260
who has like made tons of progress on

01:03:16.260 --> 01:03:20.600
hacking the DS's Wi-Fi chip and stuff. He's pretty much got it,

01:03:20.600 --> 01:03:27.600
running. Huh. So what does it do? Right now he's just trying to make the connection to

01:03:28.100 --> 01:03:34.800
a Wi-Fi hotspot. Yeah, this is a guy that's, he's already won the bounty basically for

01:03:34.800 --> 01:03:40.700
the Wi-Fi, and now he's just finishing up like the last bit of it, but he finished enough

01:03:40.700 --> 01:03:45.100
of it to where they gave him like, I think it was like $4,000. Oh, I remember you mentioning

01:03:45.100 --> 01:03:47.100
that on a previous podcast about that.

01:03:47.100 --> 01:03:48.100
Very cool.

01:03:48.100 --> 01:03:49.100
1400?

01:03:49.100 --> 01:03:50.100
Like that?

01:03:50.100 --> 01:03:51.100
Something?

01:03:51.100 --> 01:03:52.100
Yeah.

01:03:52.100 --> 01:03:58.260
Well, that link's in our chat room, www.orangelandradio.com, click on chat.

01:03:58.260 --> 01:04:06.740
Another thing, just more Mario Kart DS stuff, there's actually a, the decal maker, you know

01:04:06.740 --> 01:04:07.740
what I'm talking about?

01:04:07.740 --> 01:04:10.780
The decals you can have in it?

01:04:10.780 --> 01:04:11.780
On Mario Kart?

01:04:11.780 --> 01:04:14.780
Yeah, can't you make your own decal or something when you're on the internet?

01:04:14.780 --> 01:04:23.780
Yeah, it has a thing that'll appear next to your name and also actually go on your cart on the front of it and stuff.

01:04:23.780 --> 01:04:24.780
Yeah, that sounds kind of cool.

01:04:24.780 --> 01:04:29.780
I'm going to post another link. They actually have a decal base on this site.

01:04:29.780 --> 01:04:34.780
And you can make one before the game's even out, which is really cool.

01:04:34.780 --> 01:04:43.780
I've got one here. It's actually the Firefox logo, and it looks really good for just like 17 colors.

01:04:43.780 --> 01:04:48.780
It uses that technique of criss-crossing colors, you know what I'm talking about?

01:04:48.780 --> 01:04:49.780
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:04:49.780 --> 01:04:51.780
To make them look like a different color.

01:04:51.780 --> 01:04:57.780
Okay, I'm going to check that. So wait, you can make this before the game is out, so you'll be able to transfer it from your PC somehow?

01:04:57.780 --> 01:05:05.780
Well, you're not going to be able to transfer it, but you can, like, plan out and make one already, so then, like, you're going to have to recreate it, unfortunately, but...

01:05:07.780 --> 01:05:09.780
Mr. Game & Watch!

01:05:09.780 --> 01:05:12.780
Jamie's getting excited over there because she saw Mr. Game & Watch, so...

01:05:12.780 --> 01:05:14.780
Yeah, that's fun.

01:05:14.780 --> 01:05:15.780
Awesome, it's going to be a good time.

01:05:15.780 --> 01:05:21.780
Alright, well thanks for sharing all those links with us, and we'll be all ready to kick your ass when Mario Kart DS comes out.

01:05:21.780 --> 01:05:24.780
Oh, don't be so sure about that.

01:05:24.780 --> 01:05:29.780
It's on tournaments and we will have some type of orange lounge DS

01:05:29.780 --> 01:05:34.000
I thought I'm sure we want to I know my dream is to have the orange lounge village on a

01:05:34.260 --> 01:05:40.420
Animal crossing where you can come you can come to our town and have Jamie wacky with a bug net

01:05:42.260 --> 01:05:45.260
I'll be a good time. We'll have that set up Sunday nights during the show or something

01:05:45.260 --> 01:05:49.780
We'll have like the orange lounge village where you can come I have all these great ideas. I can't wait

01:05:49.780 --> 01:05:54.780
it is right here. Okay. Alright, well have a good one. Thanks for calling. Thanks. Alright.

01:05:54.780 --> 01:06:00.180
See you later. Lots and lots of people hammering the line tonight. Let's go to one more call

01:06:00.180 --> 01:06:07.400
for now. Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio. Hi, this is GS-191. Hey, GS-191, what's on

01:06:07.400 --> 01:06:13.580
your mind? I just want to come on and hold out the Orange Launch Radio Frapper. Yes,

01:06:13.580 --> 01:06:18.280
now the Frapper, this was something that you created that you were plugging on the forums.

01:06:18.280 --> 01:06:19.040
This is pretty cool.

01:06:19.040 --> 01:06:21.480
Tell our listeners about this.

01:06:21.480 --> 01:06:27.840
It basically just lets you, you can like, let listeners

01:06:27.840 --> 01:06:32.280
like, are you still there?

01:06:32.280 --> 01:06:33.680
You cut out for a minute there?

01:06:33.680 --> 01:06:35.520
Yeah, yeah, I'm thinking.

01:06:35.520 --> 01:06:35.920
Sorry.

01:06:35.920 --> 01:06:36.560
That's all right.

01:06:36.560 --> 01:06:37.200
Let me help you out.

01:06:37.200 --> 01:06:39.200
It looks like something that's based off of

01:06:39.200 --> 01:06:40.360
Google Maps or something?

01:06:40.360 --> 01:06:41.200
Yes, it is.

01:06:41.200 --> 01:06:44.000
So and it allows you to plot points?

01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:47.720
Yeah, kind of so, but you guys as the listeners can plot

01:06:47.720 --> 01:06:50.040
points on this map so we can see where you live.

01:06:50.040 --> 01:06:51.960
Yeah, pretty much.

01:06:51.960 --> 01:06:52.960
And I'm going to post a link.

01:06:52.960 --> 01:06:55.440
Oh, it looks like we both did at the same time there.

01:06:55.440 --> 01:06:59.680
Post a link to the official Orange Lounge Radio flapper so you guys should go visit

01:06:59.680 --> 01:07:01.840
it and plot yourself on the map.

01:07:01.840 --> 01:07:04.640
And that way we can see just where all our listeners are.

01:07:04.640 --> 01:07:08.440
And so when we see that we have a lot of listeners in one area, we might have to go, oh, we better

01:07:08.440 --> 01:07:11.560
send somebody to a tournament or something, get some coverage out there.

01:07:11.560 --> 01:07:12.560
Oh, yeah.

01:07:12.560 --> 01:07:13.560
Yeah.

01:07:13.560 --> 01:07:15.280
And plus, it's just kind of neat.

01:07:15.280 --> 01:07:17.040
It's kind of neat to know where all the listeners are.

01:07:17.040 --> 01:07:22.320
And of course, if you go to the Frapper, you can see on there that there's a high concentration

01:07:22.320 --> 01:07:25.080
of people in the Sacramento area, which of course makes sense because that's where our

01:07:25.080 --> 01:07:26.080
site's based.

01:07:26.080 --> 01:07:27.080
I know.

01:07:27.080 --> 01:07:30.160
But it's kind of neat to see the dots outside of that.

01:07:30.160 --> 01:07:33.200
It's fascinating to see the worldwide appeal this show has.

01:07:33.200 --> 01:07:35.320
It's great.

01:07:35.320 --> 01:07:38.240
So go add yourself to the Frapper, boys and girls.

01:07:38.240 --> 01:07:45.480
And if you're not in the chat room and couldn't get the link, it's www.frappr.com slash orange

01:07:45.480 --> 01:07:55.160
Thank you so much for making that and suggesting that, GS-191, and I hope we get tons of people

01:07:55.160 --> 01:07:58.760
on it so we can be giddy map people.

01:07:58.760 --> 01:07:59.760
I don't know.

01:07:59.760 --> 01:08:00.760
All right.

01:08:00.760 --> 01:08:01.760
Sure.

01:08:01.760 --> 01:08:02.760
Thanks.

01:08:02.760 --> 01:08:03.760
Yeah, sure.

01:08:03.760 --> 01:08:04.760
All right.

01:08:04.760 --> 01:08:05.760
Take care.

01:08:05.760 --> 01:08:06.760
Okay.

01:08:06.760 --> 01:08:07.760
You too.

01:08:07.760 --> 01:08:08.760
Bye.

01:08:08.760 --> 01:08:09.760
Bye.

01:08:09.760 --> 01:08:10.760
All right.

01:08:10.760 --> 01:08:11.760
We're going to go ahead and turn off the Skyblind for now.

01:08:11.760 --> 01:08:12.760
We will take more calls a little later on in the program.

01:08:12.760 --> 01:08:16.800
I think, at this point, we're going to go ahead and get into the Orange Lounge Radio

01:08:16.800 --> 01:08:17.800
Cage Match for tonight.

01:08:17.800 --> 01:08:19.800
Does that sound like fun, boys and girls?

01:08:19.800 --> 01:08:20.800
We.

01:08:20.800 --> 01:08:26.300
Alright, so I've got to get the Cage Match music queued up, but of course we had a retiree

01:08:26.300 --> 01:08:30.360
from last week, so we're going to have three brand new songs in tonight's Cage Match.

01:08:30.360 --> 01:08:32.760
So tonight's Cage Match is going to take a little more time than usual, because we're

01:08:32.760 --> 01:08:35.440
going to have three songs in their entirety.

01:08:35.440 --> 01:08:37.440
Let's get it started.

01:08:37.440 --> 01:08:41.360
Alright, the way the Orange Lounge Radio Cage Match works is that you have to be in our

01:08:41.360 --> 01:08:46.680
chat room at www.orangeloungeradio.com. We are going to play three songs for you and

01:08:46.680 --> 01:08:51.880
since there is no reigning champion because we retired last week's winner as it was its

01:08:51.880 --> 01:08:56.640
fourth win in a row, that was Pendulum with Hold Your Color, that song was retired, we're

01:08:56.640 --> 01:09:02.200
going to play three brand new songs for you in their entirety. So you're going to vote

01:09:02.200 --> 01:09:08.680
for your favorite in our chat room at www.orangeloungeradio.com and your favorite songs that you guys vote

01:09:08.680 --> 01:09:14.020
We'll go into rotation all week long on Orange Lounge Radio's 24-hour day, 7-day-a-week

01:09:14.020 --> 01:09:17.520
Romani and video game music program, which has had a lot of you guys listening to it

01:09:17.520 --> 01:09:18.920
lately, so we appreciate that.

01:09:18.920 --> 01:09:20.780
All right, so let's get it started.

01:09:20.780 --> 01:09:27.640
I guess I will go ahead, since I technically hold your color by pen norm, although it was

01:09:27.640 --> 01:09:30.920
technically my pick for the cage match, it wasn't really.

01:09:30.920 --> 01:09:34.760
I let somebody else pick that song for me, so I myself have not picked a song for the

01:09:34.760 --> 01:09:38.640
cage match for quite a while, so I want to start first, if you guys are okay with that.

01:09:38.640 --> 01:09:43.080
And my song tonight is by a group, it's a very famous group, it's a very well-known

01:09:43.080 --> 01:09:46.640
group, but not so much over the years, it's kind of cooled down a little bit.

01:09:46.640 --> 01:09:50.400
They have a brand new album out, and it's pretty good, I really like the lead single

01:09:50.400 --> 01:09:53.760
off the album, so I want to play it for you guys tonight, it's my Cage Match pick.

01:09:53.760 --> 01:09:57.680
It's Depeche Mode, and the song is called Precious, and it's my pick for song number

01:09:57.680 --> 01:10:04.680
one on tonight's Orange Lounge Cage Match.

01:10:27.680 --> 01:10:37.680
My God, what have we done to you?

01:10:37.680 --> 01:10:46.680
We always tried to share the tenderest of care

01:10:46.680 --> 01:10:55.680
Now look what we have put you through

01:10:55.680 --> 01:11:11.680
Things get damaged, things get broken I thought we'd managed, but what left unspoken Left us a prison, there was so little left to do

01:11:25.680 --> 01:11:35.680
Angels with silver wings, shouldn't know suffering

01:11:35.680 --> 01:11:44.680
I wish I could take the pain for you

01:11:44.680 --> 01:11:54.680
If God has a master plan, then only He understands

01:11:54.680 --> 01:11:58.680
I hope it's your eyes you see

01:12:03.680 --> 01:12:08.680
Things get damaged, things get broken

01:12:08.680 --> 01:12:12.680
I thought we panicked, but words left unspoken

01:12:12.680 --> 01:12:19.680
Left us to pretend, there was no reason left to give

01:12:42.680 --> 01:13:02.680
I pray you learn to trust Have faith in both of us

01:13:02.680 --> 01:13:05.680
In your thoughts for two

01:13:10.680 --> 01:13:14.680
Things get damaged, things get broken

01:13:14.680 --> 01:13:19.680
I thought we'd met, but words left unspoken

01:13:19.680 --> 01:13:26.680
Left us a prison, there was no answer left to give

01:13:49.680 --> 01:14:07.160
Alright, that was song number one in tonight's cage match, that was Depeche Mode with Precious.

01:14:07.160 --> 01:14:10.560
Was that song the precious, or was that song the crappy?

01:14:10.560 --> 01:14:12.480
Our judges in the studio will let you know.

01:14:12.480 --> 01:14:13.480
Dark Sakura.

01:14:13.480 --> 01:14:18.240
I haven't really cared for anything Depeche Mode's done since the 80's, because as I'm

01:14:18.240 --> 01:14:23.920
you know prone to calling them depressed about yeah there's a little emo

01:14:25.800 --> 01:14:31.960
it's very sedate it actually reminds me of actually some of the stuff from

01:14:31.960 --> 01:14:38.920
Silent Hill 3 along the same lines I like it a lot as listening it gets a 10

01:14:38.920 --> 01:14:43.240
for cage magic it's an 8 okay it is a little emo I'll go ahead and do my

01:14:43.240 --> 01:14:47.840
ranking it is a little emo and a little sad for cage match but um I just I'm

01:14:47.840 --> 01:14:52.840
I'm in a chill mood lately, where I'm in an emo mood, I guess. I'll admit it. I could be emo once in a while.

01:14:52.840 --> 01:14:56.840
So I give that song an 8 as well. It's fun. Loki.

01:14:56.840 --> 01:15:04.840
Now, I was going to say, Depression was kind of going the way of Crystal Method, where their last album sucked.

01:15:04.840 --> 01:15:08.840
Crystal Method's last album sucked, but the one before it was really good.

01:15:08.840 --> 01:15:16.840
And if this is one of the best songs on the album, then I'm kind of leery because I really did like Exciter.

01:15:16.840 --> 01:15:29.840
Cider. That was one of my favorite Depeche Mode albums. And this one, it's okay, but I have to listen to the rest of it before I can make my judgment on the whole thing, but I give it an 8. It's pretty good. It's just Depeche Mode can't really do wrong, so...

01:15:29.840 --> 01:15:34.840
Alright. 8, 8, 8, and now it's Angel's turn. Angel, what do you think?

01:15:34.840 --> 01:15:39.840
It's Depeche Mode. It's cool. Um... 8.

01:15:39.840 --> 01:15:42.840
I somehow knew she'd give it an 8 as well.

01:15:42.840 --> 01:15:44.840
How could you not at that point?

01:15:44.840 --> 01:15:46.840
Alright, 8's across the board for Depeche Mode Precious.

01:15:46.840 --> 01:15:49.840
But remember, it's not up to us to decide.

01:15:49.840 --> 01:15:52.840
Our scores don't mean shit. It's like that game Whose Line is Anyway.

01:15:52.840 --> 01:15:55.840
The scores don't mean shit. It's up to you guys and your votes in the chat room.

01:15:55.840 --> 01:15:58.840
We're just kind of coaxing you into which songs we think.

01:15:58.840 --> 01:16:01.840
I believe that was the first time we've done that across the board actually.

01:16:01.840 --> 01:16:03.840
In a while. I know it's been done before.

01:16:03.840 --> 01:16:05.840
Because I remember sooner or later there was a mix of girls.

01:16:05.840 --> 01:16:11.840
Those are the cage match horns that got like zeroes across the board from everybody, including Loki.

01:16:11.840 --> 01:16:14.840
Anyway, let's go on to the next song, the second song of tonight's cage match.

01:16:14.840 --> 01:16:18.840
We're going to go ahead and do Loki's pick. Loki, what did you pick tonight?

01:16:18.840 --> 01:16:22.840
I picked the song that's off of the CD.

01:16:22.840 --> 01:16:25.840
It's actually pretty cool.

01:16:25.840 --> 01:16:31.840
Kalinda, I've never heard of them before, but they're on one of those compilation trance CDs.

01:16:31.840 --> 01:16:32.840
And it sounded pretty good.

01:16:32.840 --> 01:16:37.880
good it's upbeat short that's all you need to know it's upbeat and short all

01:16:37.880 --> 01:16:40.940
right well we'll be the judges of that here it is song number two in tonight's

01:16:40.940 --> 01:16:47.940
cage match, Kalinda with I'll Surrender.

01:17:10.940 --> 01:17:17.940
All the times you did me wrong

01:17:17.940 --> 01:17:24.940
Reasons wouldn't last for long

01:17:24.940 --> 01:17:31.940
Now I'm feeling alone

01:17:31.940 --> 01:17:37.940
With a shelter aware

01:17:37.940 --> 01:17:46.940
Could I find a way to change your mind If I had a chance to make it right?

01:17:46.940 --> 01:17:53.940
Is there a moment to leave it all behind?

01:17:53.940 --> 01:18:00.940
Could I find a way to lose this pain If I had a chance to call your name?

01:18:00.940 --> 01:18:07.940
I'm surrounded, I'm given a disguise

01:18:07.940 --> 01:18:14.940
Oh, that you did me wrong

01:18:14.940 --> 01:18:21.940
Preaching for the love of love

01:18:21.940 --> 01:18:28.940
Now I'm feeling left alone

01:18:28.940 --> 01:18:48.400
I'll surrender, I'll surrender I'm giving up this fight, I'm giving up this

01:18:48.400 --> 01:18:56.400
Oh I surrender, I surrender

01:18:56.400 --> 01:19:02.400
I'm giving up this fight I'm giving up this fight

01:19:02.400 --> 01:19:10.400
Oh I surrender, I surrender

01:19:10.400 --> 01:19:16.560
I'm giving up this fight, I'm giving up this fight

01:19:16.900 --> 01:19:24.000
I'm surrounded, I'm surrendered

01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:28.000
I'm giving up this fight

01:19:28.000 --> 01:19:31.000
I'm giving up this fight

01:19:44.000 --> 01:19:48.000
I won't love you anymore

01:19:48.000 --> 01:19:51.000
I won't take it all for sure

01:19:51.000 --> 01:19:58.000
I won't love you anymore And I'll surrender

01:19:58.000 --> 01:20:05.000
I won't die you anymore I won't take it all for sure

01:20:05.000 --> 01:20:12.000
I won't love you anymore And I'll surrender

01:20:35.000 --> 01:20:41.920
generic I have to admit usually those are types of songs I'm a sucker for and

01:20:41.920 --> 01:20:44.960
there was some lovely instrumentation in that song and the woman did have a

01:20:44.960 --> 01:20:50.400
pretty voice but I'm just I'm too emo for that song tonight I really am in an

01:20:50.400 --> 01:20:54.240
emo mood today so I can't appreciate that song as much as I should so I have

01:20:54.240 --> 01:20:59.860
to give it like a six I'm very sorry Loki Loki it gets an eight and ironically

01:20:59.860 --> 01:21:06.860
enough that the amount of Mac sim files have been posted by myself since they've relaunched.

01:21:06.860 --> 01:21:12.860
Beautiful. All right, Angel, what did you think of I'll Surrender?

01:21:12.860 --> 01:21:18.860
It was okay. Seven and a half.

01:21:18.860 --> 01:21:23.860
Seven and a half from Angel. Okay, song number three tonight is Dark Sakura's Pick.

01:21:23.860 --> 01:21:25.860
Dark Sakura, what did you choose for us?

01:21:25.860 --> 01:21:28.860
Only by Nine Inch Nails, just because.

01:21:28.860 --> 01:21:29.860
Just because?

01:21:29.860 --> 01:21:31.860
Yeah, I've been in the mood.

01:21:31.860 --> 01:21:34.860
Is this like one of their hard-hitting industrial songs, or is this kind of a...

01:21:34.860 --> 01:21:35.860
You'll find out.

01:21:35.860 --> 01:21:38.860
Oh, snap. Okay, we will. Here we go.

01:21:38.860 --> 01:21:41.860
Well, song number three is Nine Inch Nails with Only.

01:22:08.860 --> 01:22:36.480
I'm becoming less defined as days go by Fading away, well you might say I'm losing

01:22:36.480 --> 01:22:40.480
Focus, kind of drifting in the abstract

01:22:40.480 --> 01:22:43.480
In terms of how I see myself

01:22:43.480 --> 01:22:47.480
Sometimes I think I can see right through myself

01:22:47.480 --> 01:22:52.480
Sometimes I think I can see right through myself

01:22:52.480 --> 01:22:57.480
Sometimes I can see right through myself

01:22:57.480 --> 01:23:01.480
Less concerned about fitting into the world

01:23:01.480 --> 01:23:03.480
Your world that is

01:23:03.480 --> 01:23:10.480
Cause it doesn't really matter, though it doesn't really matter, though it doesn't really matter anymore

01:23:10.480 --> 01:23:14.480
None of this really matters anymore

01:23:20.480 --> 01:23:24.480
This time alone, then again I always was

01:23:24.480 --> 01:23:28.480
As far back as I can tell, I think maybe it's because

01:23:28.480 --> 01:23:31.480
Because we were never really real

01:23:31.480 --> 01:23:54.480
And when I just wake you up, I just wake you up to hurt myself

01:23:54.480 --> 01:23:56.480
And who works?

01:23:57.480 --> 01:23:58.680
If you destruction

01:23:58.680 --> 01:24:00.580
There is no you

01:24:00.580 --> 01:24:02.480
There is only me

01:24:03.480 --> 01:24:05.060
There is no you

01:24:05.420 --> 01:24:06.980
There is only me

01:24:07.220 --> 01:24:08.480
There is no fucking you

01:24:09.480 --> 01:24:10.480
There is only me

01:24:10.880 --> 01:24:12.480
There is no fucking you

01:24:13.480 --> 01:24:14.980
There is only me

01:24:19.480 --> 01:24:19.980
Only

01:24:20.480 --> 01:24:21.980
Only

01:24:21.980 --> 01:24:36.980
Well the tiniest little dot caught my eye and it turned out to be a stab

01:24:36.980 --> 01:24:41.980
And I had this funny feeling like I just knew it's something bad

01:24:41.980 --> 01:24:46.980
I just couldn't leave you picking up the scale

01:24:46.980 --> 01:24:51.980
There's a doorway trying to see that you're so shy

01:24:51.980 --> 01:24:54.980
But I'm climbing up

01:24:54.980 --> 01:24:58.980
Now I'm somewhere I don't have to have to be

01:24:58.980 --> 01:25:02.980
And I can see things I know I really should have seen

01:25:02.980 --> 01:25:06.980
And now I know why, now I know why

01:26:06.980 --> 01:26:14.980
Alright fellas, sorry I'm laughing because they're having this soda versus pop debate

01:26:14.980 --> 01:26:15.980
in chat.

01:26:15.980 --> 01:26:16.980
We'll get to that in a minute.

01:26:16.980 --> 01:26:20.980
For now, let's review song number three, Nine Inch Nails with Only.

01:26:20.980 --> 01:26:26.980
Is that the only song for you, or is that a song you would like to, I don't know, equiv-

01:26:26.980 --> 01:26:28.980
uh, equiv-late to Nine Inch Nails on a chalkboard?

01:26:28.980 --> 01:26:29.980
That's awesome.

01:26:29.980 --> 01:26:30.980
Careful there.

01:26:30.980 --> 01:26:31.980
Yep, gotta turn it.

01:26:31.980 --> 01:26:32.980
He's a piece of shit.

01:26:32.980 --> 01:26:34.980
Careful there, yep, gotta turn it.

01:26:34.980 --> 01:26:35.980
He's a piece of shit.

01:26:35.980 --> 01:26:36.980
I know, weird mic tone.

01:26:36.980 --> 01:26:42.980
That song just, it's got the, that emphasis it didn't normally do, but it's a lot more laid back.

01:26:42.980 --> 01:26:45.980
Probably gets me a date from me.

01:26:45.980 --> 01:26:49.980
You know, it's not the usual Nine Inch Nails song, and if I was in a normal mood,

01:26:49.980 --> 01:26:52.980
I would probably penalize the song for not sounding like a normal Nine Inch Nails song.

01:26:52.980 --> 01:26:58.980
However, it fits my emo mood, therefore it gets a bonus point, and I give it a nine.

01:26:58.980 --> 01:27:04.980
Loki, I am in a normal mood and I'm going to penalize it for not being a normal Nine Inch Nails song.

01:27:04.980 --> 01:27:06.980
It gets a five.

01:27:06.980 --> 01:27:08.980
Alright.

01:27:08.980 --> 01:27:13.980
Angel has left the room momentarily, but we would assume that she would give it, like, a ten.

01:27:13.980 --> 01:27:16.980
Well, yeah, she gave everything else an eight tonight. Oh, there's Angel.

01:27:16.980 --> 01:27:20.980
What would you give that song, Nine Inch Nails only?

01:27:20.980 --> 01:27:22.980
Uh, eight!

01:27:22.980 --> 01:27:24.980
See, there you go, have an eight.

01:27:24.980 --> 01:27:27.780
But remember, it's not up to us, it's up to you.

01:27:27.780 --> 01:27:29.980
Here are the three songs you can vote for tonight.

01:27:29.980 --> 01:27:32.380
A quick recap in tonight's Cage Match.

01:27:32.380 --> 01:27:34.680
Three brand new songs, no returning champions.

01:27:34.680 --> 01:27:36.780
Song number one, Precious, Depeche Mode.

01:27:42.780 --> 01:27:45.880
And song number two you can vote for tonight is

01:27:45.880 --> 01:27:56.840
Kalinda with I'll Surrender and song number three you can vote for tonight

01:27:56.840 --> 01:28:10.240
is Nine Inch Nails with Only Alright kids, place vote now.

01:28:10.240 --> 01:28:14.520
Send a private message to Sky in the chat room with your vote for Depeche Mode.

01:28:14.520 --> 01:28:19.440
Song number one, Calienda, song number two, or Nine Inch Nails, song number three.

01:28:19.440 --> 01:28:20.440
Do it.

01:28:20.440 --> 01:28:21.440
Do it now.

01:28:21.440 --> 01:28:22.440
All the cool kids are doing it.

01:28:22.440 --> 01:28:27.320
And if you don't, you are going to get a massive wedgie from all of us.

01:28:27.320 --> 01:28:32.540
Loki, what's going on in the sim scene, dare I ask, in the Dance Dance Revolution and other

01:28:32.540 --> 01:28:34.760
music gaming simulation?

01:28:34.760 --> 01:28:40.280
As I mentioned before with the eight brand new Max remixes, not much as far as the sim

01:28:40.280 --> 01:28:47.280
goes on my cell, or at least all the submissions, but there is another tournament going on.

01:28:47.280 --> 01:28:56.280
Since TourneyMix is gone for good, hopefully, we have OSC 4, or the Original Step File Competition,

01:28:56.280 --> 01:29:07.280
4. And basically the rules are a little bit different than TourneyMix, and basically the

01:29:07.280 --> 01:29:18.280
The main stuff is, let's see here, basically the staff can't enter, which is probably good

01:29:18.280 --> 01:29:21.280
because why would they be voting on their own songs?

01:29:21.280 --> 01:29:29.280
But anyways, there's going to be one, I don't know, it looks exactly the same to me.

01:29:29.280 --> 01:29:33.280
To be honest, they have different divisions, DDR, in the groove, and keyboard.

01:29:33.280 --> 01:29:41.560
So I'm guessing playable, not quite playable, and not playable would be those three categories.

01:29:41.560 --> 01:29:48.480
And it doesn't really say when the submissions are due yet, but let's see.

01:29:48.480 --> 01:29:49.480
My mistake.

01:29:49.480 --> 01:29:51.800
November 13th is when it's up.

01:29:51.800 --> 01:29:54.600
So you said that Turnamix is gone forever?

01:29:54.600 --> 01:29:55.600
Supposedly.

01:29:55.600 --> 01:30:06.740
There is no public voting, so basically it's just by panel review. The public though can

01:30:06.740 --> 01:30:12.800
post the reviews for the songs in each division when they're released and rank it. The average

01:30:12.800 --> 01:30:18.700
score from the public review is then taken and will make up 50% of the song's final division

01:30:18.700 --> 01:30:26.740
score. So, and hopefully, hopefully, they will post, or they won't post, who the song

01:30:26.740 --> 01:30:34.440
is made by. You know, they make it fair, but I don't think that's gonna happen. So yeah,

01:30:34.440 --> 01:30:41.140
that's about it. Other than Dance Tracks, a new StepMania-based game making its way

01:30:41.140 --> 01:30:49.100
to the web, and of course, hopefully pretty soon, the arcades. No real details on it at

01:30:49.100 --> 01:30:54.420
all, other than the fact that you've got, you know, people like D.M. Ashura, Beat Drop,

01:30:54.420 --> 01:31:03.260
and just other people doing music for it. So, it'll be interesting. That's it.

01:31:03.260 --> 01:31:08.620
Alright. Moving on, DarkSakura, I know you were surfing the web a little bit there in

01:31:08.620 --> 01:31:13.020
the background, and you found some pictures from an upcoming movie that we're very excited

01:31:13.020 --> 01:31:14.020
about.

01:31:14.020 --> 01:31:16.020
I thought maybe you wanted to share this with our listeners.

01:31:16.020 --> 01:31:17.020
Oh, yeah.

01:31:17.020 --> 01:31:22.820
Silent Hill movie images up on IGN, one of our listeners linked it on our website, on

01:31:22.820 --> 01:31:23.820
our forums.

01:31:23.820 --> 01:31:32.900
Anyone who was basically naysaying, if these images are any type of indication, it is Silent

01:31:32.900 --> 01:31:33.900
Hill.

01:31:33.900 --> 01:31:34.900
It's official.

01:31:34.900 --> 01:31:36.900
Very, very perfect.

01:31:38.900 --> 01:31:43.900
Down to the environment, down to the...

01:31:43.900 --> 01:31:46.900
Even the colors the characters are dressed in.

01:31:47.900 --> 01:31:50.900
Even the colors that the characters are dressed in is very somber.

01:31:50.900 --> 01:31:52.900
It completely matches the style.

01:31:52.900 --> 01:31:54.900
I'm very excited after seeing the pictures.

01:31:54.900 --> 01:31:56.900
It looks like they're going to get it right.

01:31:56.900 --> 01:31:58.900
I'm so excited that they might get a video game movie right.

01:31:58.900 --> 01:32:01.900
I'm just elated, so I'm very, very happy about that.

01:32:01.900 --> 01:32:04.900
Of course, then again, the Mortal Kombat pictures were cool when I first saw them, too.

01:32:04.900 --> 01:32:05.900
But I have hope.

01:32:05.900 --> 01:32:09.900
These three can look like they're from the game, only, like, better quality, of course.

01:32:09.900 --> 01:32:14.900
And in other news, during the Saw II of the previews, they played Blood Range,

01:32:14.900 --> 01:32:16.900
which I yelled out in the middle of the audience,

01:32:16.900 --> 01:32:18.900
A MOVIE FUCKING SUCKS!

01:32:18.900 --> 01:32:20.900
Everyone laughed.

01:32:20.900 --> 01:32:23.900
I need to see Doom so I can laugh at it.

01:32:23.900 --> 01:32:26.900
I think Doom has already fallen out of the top ten movies.

01:32:26.900 --> 01:32:28.900
It's gone.

01:32:28.900 --> 01:32:34.380
and made, I think, like half of its budget back, if even that.

01:32:34.380 --> 01:32:38.600
Let's see, and what else? Oh, did you guys hear this week what movie

01:32:38.600 --> 01:32:45.220
has got a push to be made now? A video game movie was licensed out and now

01:32:45.220 --> 01:32:48.100
has a directory attached and the script's being written for?

01:32:48.100 --> 01:32:51.680
Castlevania. Castlevania's being turned into a movie.

01:32:51.680 --> 01:32:53.900
It's got to be done right, that's all I think.

01:32:53.900 --> 01:32:57.300
Well, here's who's attached to direct. I believe his name is Paul Anderson.

01:32:57.300 --> 01:32:59.780
he was the guy that did Mortal Kombat and Resident Evil.

01:32:59.780 --> 01:33:03.780
Well now, Mortal Kombat was a good movie, and Resident Evil was a good movie.

01:33:03.780 --> 01:33:07.260
Well, I liked Resident Evil, shut up.

01:33:07.260 --> 01:33:08.260
They were fun.

01:33:08.260 --> 01:33:09.260
I'll give it that.

01:33:09.260 --> 01:33:11.260
They weren't Oscar caliber movies, but they were fun.

01:33:11.260 --> 01:33:13.260
Mortal Kombat, I think, was done right.

01:33:13.260 --> 01:33:14.260
They were tolerable.

01:33:14.260 --> 01:33:18.980
You know, when you put them next to a Uwe Boll movie, I mean, honestly, it doesn't look

01:33:18.980 --> 01:33:19.980
that bad.

01:33:19.980 --> 01:33:20.980
They actually are pretty good.

01:33:20.980 --> 01:33:23.940
Mortal Kombat was, you put Mortal Kombat in the movie next to Street Fighter in the movie,

01:33:23.940 --> 01:33:26.700
and it's like, oh, I watched Mortal Kombat like 20 times, seriously.

01:33:26.700 --> 01:33:33.280
So honestly, probably Paul Anderson to date has set the bar for a decent video game movie

01:33:33.280 --> 01:33:34.560
that is yet to be exceeded.

01:33:34.560 --> 01:33:38.120
I don't think there has been a better video game movie than Mortal Kombat or Resident

01:33:38.120 --> 01:33:39.120
Evil.

01:33:39.120 --> 01:33:41.700
I'm quite excited about the Peter Jackson Halo.

01:33:41.700 --> 01:33:46.180
But see, with Silent Hill on deck and Halo, eventually, I think it's going to push the

01:33:46.180 --> 01:33:47.180
bar up.

01:33:47.180 --> 01:33:48.180
I'm hoping.

01:33:48.180 --> 01:33:49.180
I hope so, too.

01:33:49.180 --> 01:33:51.180
And people need to stop making movies.

01:33:51.180 --> 01:33:52.180
Period.

01:33:52.180 --> 01:33:57.500
Of course, we talked about in the last podcast, the Dungeon Siege is going to be two movies

01:33:57.500 --> 01:33:58.500
four hours long.

01:33:58.500 --> 01:33:59.500
Epic.

01:33:59.500 --> 01:34:00.500
Epic.

01:34:00.500 --> 01:34:01.500
It's an epic Yui Bowl event.

01:34:01.500 --> 01:34:05.380
I have not actually seen a Yui Bowl movie yet, just because they're so bad, but I really

01:34:05.380 --> 01:34:11.220
need to sit down so I can nitpick them on particular issues, because I know that just

01:34:11.220 --> 01:34:18.220
the movies overall are really bad and uninspiring and just awful, but I'm kind of curious to

01:34:18.220 --> 01:34:20.460
see BloodRayne, because at least she gets naked.

01:34:20.460 --> 01:34:26.740
So at least they've got that going for it. So yeah, that'd be good.

01:34:26.740 --> 01:34:30.140
No, no, no, I was just... I don't even need it. Bye, bye.

01:34:30.140 --> 01:34:34.020
I thought you were going to comment on something. Weren't you excited about Castlevania, the

01:34:34.020 --> 01:34:36.020
movie, or as I call it, Castlevania?

01:34:36.020 --> 01:34:39.140
Mmm, Simon. Simon?

01:34:39.140 --> 01:34:42.020
Okay. Let's hope to hell they get the right actor

01:34:42.020 --> 01:34:46.260
to play Simon. I know, why don't they just have Hugh Jackman do it again?

01:34:46.260 --> 01:34:48.740
i have an idea how we get

01:34:48.740 --> 01:34:51.340
indies all the place seven belmont

01:34:51.340 --> 01:34:52.620
albino

01:34:52.620 --> 01:34:54.300
well jim carrey is

01:34:54.300 --> 01:34:58.100
so i don't know what you know i'm not not to throw this topic in the gutter

01:34:58.100 --> 01:35:00.720
but vin diesel is a very very big joke

01:35:00.720 --> 01:35:03.760
around where you're going to have a little bit earlier

01:35:03.760 --> 01:35:04.780
whenever

01:35:04.780 --> 01:35:08.460
vin diesel plate or else we're seeing a bit all the characters in the movie

01:35:08.460 --> 01:35:12.780
british apparel as simon belmont

01:35:12.780 --> 01:35:19.780
but

01:35:20.560 --> 01:35:24.140
that never mind

01:35:24.140 --> 01:35:27.900
jigsaw the clown is simon belmont

01:35:27.900 --> 01:35:30.460
anyway

01:35:30.460 --> 01:35:33.460
moving on uh... that should be interesting i'll outlet

01:35:33.460 --> 01:35:35.980
don't know before we go break i want to talk

01:35:35.980 --> 01:35:37.620
about uh...

01:35:37.620 --> 01:35:39.300
xbox three sixty

01:35:39.300 --> 01:35:42.060
and of course i want to bring this up again on the podcast later but all

01:35:42.060 --> 01:35:44.820
Oh, speaking of tonight's podcast, damn, I said I would get this out at some point.

01:35:44.820 --> 01:35:48.460
Tonight's podcast is going to be the winner, because we have not one but two interviews

01:35:48.460 --> 01:35:49.460
on tonight's podcast.

01:35:49.460 --> 01:35:50.460
It's going to be cool.

01:35:50.460 --> 01:35:52.660
We're actually going to be doing a follow-up.

01:35:52.660 --> 01:35:56.700
I don't know if you guys heard about this, but Kings Quest IX, there was this fan project

01:35:56.700 --> 01:36:01.980
going on to create a fan version of Kings Quest, because Vivendi, when they basically

01:36:01.980 --> 01:36:04.880
bought Sierra, said, oh, we're not going to do any more Kings Quest games because nobody

01:36:04.880 --> 01:36:08.900
plays them, which, obviously, because the huge community out there turned out to not

01:36:08.900 --> 01:36:13.080
be true, because there's a great King's Quest community out there, well, they were starting

01:36:13.080 --> 01:36:17.800
to create their own version of King's Quest, King's Quest IX, and Vivendi sent a cease

01:36:17.800 --> 01:36:21.120
and desist to them a couple weeks ago. Well, now there's this huge campaign to save them.

01:36:21.120 --> 01:36:24.560
Tonight's podcast, we're going to be talking to the guy that started one of the biggest

01:36:24.560 --> 01:36:28.700
websites out there about the campaign, and we're going to be talking to the project director

01:36:28.700 --> 01:36:35.680
behind King's Quest IX, the fan version. So it should be very interesting, KQIX, as they

01:36:35.680 --> 01:36:40.200
call it for short, so tune into that. But also, this is something I probably will address

01:36:40.200 --> 01:36:43.920
on the podcast as well, but I have to bring this up on the live show because I get more

01:36:43.920 --> 01:36:49.240
time to rant here than I do on the podcast, and that's to do with Xbox 360. Now, Loki,

01:36:49.240 --> 01:36:51.560
you were saying that you're going to be getting yours on launch day.

01:36:51.560 --> 01:36:57.000
Well, every day I kind of question that more and more just because of what Microsoft's

01:36:57.000 --> 01:37:06.320
doing their trickling in the allocations, so it's like, okay, X-Store, you had 200 Xboxes,

01:37:06.320 --> 01:37:09.320
thank you for pre-selling all of this, we're going to send you 10. You know, or like, you

01:37:09.320 --> 01:37:14.340
know, stuff like that. It's just really ridiculous. The store I booked mine at is not as busy

01:37:14.340 --> 01:37:20.120
as the other store that I used to, the GameStop I used to pre-book stuff at was in the mall,

01:37:20.120 --> 01:37:24.400
you know, a high-traffic GameStop and stuff, and it was a bitch and a half to try to get

01:37:24.400 --> 01:37:30.000
anything from them. So now I've booked stuff now at the GameStop that's only a couple blocks

01:37:30.000 --> 01:37:34.400
from my house. It's really small. There's never really anyone in there and that type

01:37:34.400 --> 01:37:39.640
of stuff. So I'm hoping that there's not that many people that have booked them, and I got

01:37:39.640 --> 01:37:45.120
in on one of the few that they've got. But even like some of the stores that hardly have

01:37:45.120 --> 01:37:52.080
any orders for them, they're not getting hardly anything. So it's really iffy. Hopefully I

01:37:52.080 --> 01:37:57.000
I am because I've got two games on order there and two on order at my work, and so I'm really

01:37:57.000 --> 01:38:01.120
trying to get a lot of this stuff in, plus I'm trying to butter up the people we sell

01:38:01.120 --> 01:38:06.360
to, the publishers, to have them send me some free stuff, but that's a whole other story.

01:38:06.360 --> 01:38:07.360
But yeah.

01:38:07.360 --> 01:38:10.120
You know, I got to play an Xbox 360 kiosk finally.

01:38:10.120 --> 01:38:11.120
What is that?

01:38:11.120 --> 01:38:16.480
Best Buy has them, two of them in the area have the kiosk set up, the one over by Birdcage

01:38:16.480 --> 01:38:19.800
has one, that's where I played it yesterday.

01:38:19.800 --> 01:38:25.120
And they have demos of Cameo and Call of Duty 2.

01:38:25.120 --> 01:38:26.120
And King Kong?

01:38:26.120 --> 01:38:27.120
No, just those two.

01:38:27.120 --> 01:38:29.520
Or at least those two were the ones I noticed that were playable.

01:38:29.520 --> 01:38:31.320
I know they had videos of a bunch of other ones too.

01:38:31.320 --> 01:38:33.400
I don't remember King Kong's playable usually.

01:38:33.400 --> 01:38:36.040
But it might be a different disc, who knows?

01:38:36.040 --> 01:38:37.680
Yeah, I just missed it completely.

01:38:37.680 --> 01:38:40.680
But I did notice specifically those two games were playable.

01:38:40.680 --> 01:38:44.480
And I have to say I was incredibly underwhelmed with Cameo.

01:38:44.480 --> 01:38:46.360
Cameo was the one I really paid attention to.

01:38:46.360 --> 01:38:51.260
Call of Duty 2 had pretty graphics and stuff, but Cameo was a little bit underwhelming.

01:38:51.260 --> 01:38:56.100
I can see where people are making these Xbox 1.5 comparisons, where it just looks slightly

01:38:56.100 --> 01:38:57.100
better than the Xbox.

01:38:57.100 --> 01:38:58.660
It's not much better.

01:38:58.660 --> 01:39:01.900
I'm surprised because Cameo was actually one of the ones I was pretty impressed with.

01:39:01.900 --> 01:39:05.500
All the first party stuff seemed to be pretty good, and Cameo was one of them.

01:39:05.500 --> 01:39:10.140
I don't know if maybe the particular level or the sub that they have is not very forgiving

01:39:10.140 --> 01:39:14.540
to the game, but the one that we saw, they were showing kind of like the draw distance

01:39:14.540 --> 01:39:19.540
of the game and stuff and there was like hundreds and thousands of like these creatures just

01:39:19.540 --> 01:39:24.880
battling on this field and then she rides this horse up into this entire like volcano

01:39:24.880 --> 01:39:28.860
type thing and looks down and you can see everybody fighting down below and just like

01:39:28.860 --> 01:39:30.660
really detailed.

01:39:30.660 --> 01:39:36.100
It looked really good and it's kind of like a Zelda type game and now with Elder Scrolls

01:39:36.100 --> 01:39:40.780
being pushed to next year now, it's the only RPG that's going to be out there.

01:39:40.780 --> 01:39:46.980
It's more of an action adventure game, I think, like Zelda, more than an RPG.

01:39:46.980 --> 01:39:52.160
But more and more games keep moving, so it's tough.

01:39:52.160 --> 01:39:55.380
It's definitely going to be interesting come launch day.

01:39:55.380 --> 01:39:56.460
The jury's out now for me.

01:39:56.460 --> 01:40:01.020
I was completely sold on Xbox 360 and I wanted to pick one up on launch day, but now I'm

01:40:01.020 --> 01:40:03.140
not so sure I want to get one on launch day.

01:40:03.140 --> 01:40:08.340
I don't know if I want to fight those crowds and stuff, so we'll see how that goes.

01:40:08.340 --> 01:40:11.380
It's going to kind of depend on what mood I'm in that day, but after spending $70 on

01:40:11.380 --> 01:40:15.700
Guitar Hero, I don't know if I want to spend another $400 on an Xbox, so we'll see.

01:40:15.700 --> 01:40:20.020
Anyway, somebody in chat room asked me very nicely if they could call in because they

01:40:20.020 --> 01:40:24.220
had a story related to what we're talking about right now, so I said, okay, I'll make

01:40:24.220 --> 01:40:25.220
an exception.

01:40:25.220 --> 01:40:26.220
So who do we have on the line?

01:40:26.220 --> 01:40:27.220
Hi, it's Sephiroth1215 here.

01:40:27.220 --> 01:40:28.220
Hello, Sephiroth1215.

01:40:28.220 --> 01:40:33.620
Now, what did you want to say in regards to Xbox 360?

01:40:33.620 --> 01:40:37.780
I actually said briefly in the chat room before, but no related response, I don't even know

01:40:37.780 --> 01:40:41.220
people are paying attention but we're trying to stay on top of it but we also

01:40:41.220 --> 01:40:44.400
enjoy listening to ourselves talk so it's kind of hard to stay on top of it

01:40:44.400 --> 01:40:49.000
sometimes I think I saw it good but yeah I actually just went by a

01:40:49.000 --> 01:40:52.360
Toys R Us today and I was able to reserve one guaranteed to get in a 20

01:40:52.360 --> 01:40:56.560
second when did Toys R Us start doing reserves that's the point everybody

01:40:56.560 --> 01:41:00.640
forgot about Toys R Us that's why I keep saying go to Toys R Us go to Target and

01:41:00.640 --> 01:41:03.600
stuff like that because no one remembers about Toys R Us but Target doesn't do

01:41:03.600 --> 01:41:07.120
I know, but they're going to get their games in.

01:41:07.120 --> 01:41:10.960
See, the systems are going to be in at Target, you have to be there at six in the morning,

01:41:10.960 --> 01:41:15.240
and they're basically going to go out there, it's first come first serve, the first people

01:41:15.240 --> 01:41:20.080
in line or whatever get this card that, you know, entitles them to buy the system, and

01:41:20.080 --> 01:41:23.960
then, you know, they keep doing it until it's sold out, and that's it.

01:41:23.960 --> 01:41:28.920
See, okay, Loki, tell me, why should I buy an Xbox 360?

01:41:28.920 --> 01:41:29.920
Why?

01:41:29.920 --> 01:41:33.920
Why do I need one in two weeks or whenever the damn thing's coming out?

01:41:33.920 --> 01:41:37.800
Well, personally, like me, I'm a consumer whore and I have to get it right when it comes

01:41:37.800 --> 01:41:39.200
out.

01:41:39.200 --> 01:41:43.240
Just mainly the reason why I want to get it so I can review this stuff right, you know,

01:41:43.240 --> 01:41:48.880
kind of try to get an edge, you know, on everything because I know we're not IGN, we're not GameSpot

01:41:48.880 --> 01:41:53.660
or anything like that, and so having this console now as opposed to two months from

01:41:53.660 --> 01:41:57.780
now is important to me, so I need to get that stuff.

01:41:57.780 --> 01:42:03.840
The other thing is, also, with the date of the PlayStation 3 kind of up in the air, the

01:42:03.840 --> 01:42:08.260
next system that we know is going to launch is going to be in June, which is the revolution.

01:42:08.260 --> 01:42:14.380
That's almost seven months away. I don't want to wait seven months, so I got to do that.

01:42:14.380 --> 01:42:15.980
And also, Burnout is coming out in March, so...

01:42:15.980 --> 01:42:20.940
Oh, yeah. There's the real answer. Okay. All right. So, how much did they make you put

01:42:20.940 --> 01:42:23.980
down at Toys R Us for the Xbox 360?

01:42:23.980 --> 01:42:30.980
50, but the problem is you have to get a bundle. So you have to get the, not the core, but

01:42:31.700 --> 01:42:36.960
the, um, I keep forgetting the name, there's core and there's... Just Xbox 360. The plus,

01:42:36.960 --> 01:42:41.840
the plus pack or what? Just Xbox 360. Hold on, I mean, of course you have to get the

01:42:41.840 --> 01:42:45.360
premium version, which is alright anyway, because that's going to be the harder one

01:42:45.360 --> 01:42:51.760
to find, and cores are going to be probably pretty easy, but still... Wait, are they making

01:42:51.760 --> 01:42:53.880
you get games with it too?

01:42:53.880 --> 01:42:55.440
Yeah.

01:42:55.440 --> 01:42:59.320
I heard a rumor about this now. Wasn't there something on Slash Thought about how Microsoft

01:42:59.320 --> 01:43:03.320
was like forcing retailers to make sure people walk out the door with two games or something

01:43:03.320 --> 01:43:04.320
like that?

01:43:04.320 --> 01:43:06.760
Well, you're going to have to because in order for them to be guaranteed to get them in,

01:43:06.760 --> 01:43:11.120
they have to guarantee that they're going to do ten million dollars with Microsoft in

01:43:11.120 --> 01:43:17.760
like I want to say the next year or in the next few months. So, ten million dollars,

01:43:17.760 --> 01:43:21.000
you're going to have to push those games like big time.

01:43:21.000 --> 01:43:28.000
Honestly, the more and more I hear, the less and less I want to support this system on the launch day, because I don't like their tactics.

01:43:28.000 --> 01:43:36.000
I realize it's all business, and it's just trying to make money and stuff, and trying to sell as many as they can before Christmas, but honestly, there's got to be a better way of doing that.

01:43:36.000 --> 01:43:40.000
The whole thing is, though, is they're trickling them out so they can say, oh yeah, it sold out on the first day.

01:43:40.000 --> 01:43:44.000
Well, yeah, if you put out half the amount that you're supposed to put out, of course it's going to sell out, morons.

01:43:44.000 --> 01:43:48.000
But the gamer community is well aware of what Microsoft's trying to play with us.

01:43:48.000 --> 01:43:52.920
consumer does not and follow the game industry and they don't know better the

01:43:52.920 --> 01:43:55.800
average consumer is not to be waiting at six o'clock in the morning after the

01:43:55.800 --> 01:43:59.320
target when they're out there he wants to get his fucking xbox 360 for

01:43:59.320 --> 01:44:02.080
christmas you better damn well believe people are gonna be waiting in line for

01:44:02.080 --> 01:44:05.440
these things are fighting over they look at tickle meal no that thing is fucking

01:44:05.440 --> 01:44:10.120
retarded but people went out and bottom gotten riots it's retarded but that's

01:44:10.120 --> 01:44:16.000
that that's what it is it's the item for christmas that everybody must have and

01:44:16.000 --> 01:44:26.000
And Microsoft wants to be that item, but what's funny enough is that actually it's the number two item for a Christmas iPod Nano being the top Christmas item right now.

01:44:26.000 --> 01:44:30.000
Also, again, more reason why Apple should get into the gaming market in one way or another.

01:44:30.000 --> 01:44:34.000
Yeah, because you know, they're really known for gaming and they're PC's.

01:44:34.000 --> 01:44:38.000
If Apple and Nintendo teamed up, I swear to God, it would be a force to beat.

01:44:38.000 --> 01:44:43.000
Apple and Nintendo, if they teamed up, they're the masters of getting people to buy the same shit over.

01:44:43.000 --> 01:44:45.000
I mean, look at what Apple just fucking did.

01:44:45.000 --> 01:44:46.400
They released an iPod and then they said,

01:44:46.400 --> 01:44:48.200
no, no, no, no, you gotta have an iPod color.

01:44:48.200 --> 01:44:50.000
No, no, no, no, no, you gotta have an iPod Shuffle.

01:44:50.000 --> 01:44:51.120
No, no, no, wait, an iPod Nano.

01:44:51.120 --> 01:44:52.840
No, no, no, no, wait, we got one that plays videos.

01:44:52.840 --> 01:44:54.280
They're playing Nintendo.

01:44:54.280 --> 01:44:57.160
Exactly, Apple and Nintendo, a match made in heaven.

01:44:57.160 --> 01:44:59.160
Tell me it shouldn't happen.

01:44:59.160 --> 01:45:00.000
I agree.

01:45:00.000 --> 01:45:00.840
It should.

01:45:00.840 --> 01:45:03.720
Okay, sorry, Sephiroth, we're just making you listen

01:45:03.720 --> 01:45:05.600
to our rants there, but.

01:45:05.600 --> 01:45:06.440
That's all right.

01:45:06.440 --> 01:45:08.800
I think Loki's pretty much completely right

01:45:08.800 --> 01:45:10.400
on this one, though.

01:45:10.400 --> 01:45:17.400
Yeah, I hate to say it, but I know Loki's right on this one, but it just doesn't piss me off any less, though.

01:45:18.720 --> 01:45:22.880
Yeah, we'll see what you mean, but us gamers have to get it when we can anyway, so...

01:45:22.880 --> 01:45:26.040
I know. Anything else you want to share with our listeners?

01:45:26.040 --> 01:45:29.360
Uh, yeah. I mean,

01:45:29.360 --> 01:45:32.780
I realize getting a bundle isn't too bad, because

01:45:32.780 --> 01:45:35.080
even with the games that it's coming with,

01:45:35.080 --> 01:45:39.680
it's three games, and I could just go back to another towards Drus,

01:45:39.680 --> 01:45:42.880
or go to a Walmart and return for credit

01:45:42.880 --> 01:45:45.940
without a receipt, so it's not too bad. Now that's thinking.

01:45:45.940 --> 01:45:49.120
I like the way this guy thinks. Smart idea. If you don't want to have to buy these,

01:45:49.120 --> 01:45:52.280
forced to buy these games or whatever, then just buy them and take them back to another

01:45:52.280 --> 01:45:53.040
store.

01:45:53.040 --> 01:45:57.080
Beautiful idea. I like it.

01:45:57.080 --> 01:45:59.940
Well, thank you so much for calling in. We're going to try and get past this topic

01:45:59.940 --> 01:46:03.000
soon enough, but we appreciate your perspective in letting us know about

01:46:03.000 --> 01:46:05.160
Toys R Us. That's a good, that's a good

01:46:05.160 --> 01:46:08.840
FYI. And somebody in chat suggested Circuit City, which I think is another good idea.

01:46:08.840 --> 01:46:12.560
everybody forgets about Circuit City and also there's some other places that you'd

01:46:12.560 --> 01:46:16.040
never think to um... book a uh... 360

01:46:16.040 --> 01:46:18.040
that one being Kohl's

01:46:18.040 --> 01:46:22.480
I didn't even know Kohl's carried electronics, let alone having 360s

01:46:22.480 --> 01:46:25.200
Kohl's is one of them um... also

01:46:25.200 --> 01:46:28.520
like I mentioned before Target and Best Buy, Best Buy they're saying is going to have a lot more

01:46:28.520 --> 01:46:29.960
because apparently

01:46:29.960 --> 01:46:34.000
Bill Gates is going to be uh... whoring the Xbox 360 out at one of the best

01:46:34.000 --> 01:46:36.200
spies in Manhattan, that's the rumor

01:46:36.200 --> 01:46:38.920
at least and because of that there's a deal now where they're going to be

01:46:38.920 --> 01:46:42.040
getting a larger allocation over everybody else

01:46:42.040 --> 01:46:45.480
suckin microsoft's cock for more x boxes beautiful

01:46:45.480 --> 01:46:49.960
and uh... basically i just a lot of these no source that everybody forgets

01:46:49.960 --> 01:46:53.760
about just go check them and see if you get three sixty there

01:46:53.760 --> 01:46:57.160
i mean cole's cold i think i got out of there with

01:46:57.160 --> 01:47:04.160
on the next box three sixty and now and new underwear

01:47:04.160 --> 01:47:07.600
But yeah, when I soil my pants at Dead or Alive 4.

01:47:07.600 --> 01:47:09.120
Yes, anything else?

01:47:09.120 --> 01:47:14.080
Honestly, yeah, it will be possible to get one by this launch day, I'm sure, if you just

01:47:14.080 --> 01:47:15.160
try hard enough.

01:47:15.160 --> 01:47:16.480
It's not too hard.

01:47:16.480 --> 01:47:21.340
So I mean, if people rush out to Toys R Us like tomorrow, I'm sure you might be able

01:47:21.340 --> 01:47:26.400
to get one reserved, but there's still going to be quantities.

01:47:26.400 --> 01:47:32.800
And also, I say don't listen to the people at EVR Games because all they ever tell me

01:47:32.800 --> 01:47:37.760
is no you can't go anywhere else. And I took off my money from my reserve at EB today and

01:47:37.760 --> 01:47:41.700
they laughed at me saying you're not going to be able to get it. Because I guess they're

01:47:41.700 --> 01:47:46.060
told that only reserve for them and you're not going to be able to get it is through

01:47:46.060 --> 01:47:47.060
them.

01:47:47.060 --> 01:47:52.760
No, I, they just, you know, a lot of their market is based on pre-sales and stuff so

01:47:52.760 --> 01:47:55.840
I just, you know, I'm kind of surprised they're trying to, they're just doing anything they

01:47:55.840 --> 01:47:57.500
can to get you to keep your pre-sale there.

01:47:57.500 --> 01:48:01.320
I remember EB telling me that I couldn't find a PSP anywhere and then I took my money and

01:48:01.320 --> 01:48:04.520
the best buy and oh hey look there's a stack of 30 of them yeah same thing

01:48:04.520 --> 01:48:08.040
happened with me and the ds so anyway all right we're gonna let you go step

01:48:08.040 --> 01:48:11.320
off but thanks so much for your call okay

01:48:12.120 --> 01:48:15.000
bye okay bye

01:48:15.880 --> 01:48:20.280
all right anyway uh appreciate that call there got us on a little bit of a rant

01:48:20.280 --> 01:48:24.280
about xbox 360 um now this i think is really interesting and loki i saw you

01:48:24.280 --> 01:48:27.960
had this up earlier can you go back to oneup.com and their story about the oh

01:48:27.960 --> 01:48:33.120
oh, you already had it, great, the Xbox 360 versus the Dreamcast, I think this article

01:48:33.120 --> 01:48:41.800
is so hilarious where they compare the Dreamcast, which, you know, Dreamcast, it didn't succeed,

01:48:41.800 --> 01:48:45.360
but it wasn't because it was a bad system, because Dreamcast actually had a lot of good

01:48:45.360 --> 01:48:50.720
stuff on it, Phantasy Star Online was, like, revolutionary, and the little, what was the

01:48:50.720 --> 01:48:56.200
thingy called, the VMU, that could have, like, its own games on it, that stuff was revolutionary,

01:48:56.200 --> 01:48:58.300
But unfortunately the Dreamcast didn't succeed.

01:48:58.300 --> 01:49:02.580
So it's interesting to see them drawing comparisons to the Dreamcast and the Xbox 360.

01:49:02.580 --> 01:49:04.140
So this article is over on 1UP.com.

01:49:04.140 --> 01:49:08.380
Logan, read us like five or so comparisons here between Dreamcast and 360.

01:49:08.380 --> 01:49:12.260
Launched the year before the competition, and that's the same on both.

01:49:12.260 --> 01:49:13.260
Okay.

01:49:13.260 --> 01:49:15.060
Um, let's see here.

01:49:15.060 --> 01:49:19.540
Had a sleek white console following the footsteps of a bulky black console.

01:49:19.540 --> 01:49:22.380
Now, technicality though, my Xbox is green.

01:49:22.380 --> 01:49:26.020
Okay, yeah, but yours, the original one was black, okay.

01:49:26.020 --> 01:49:29.020
The little swirly thing.

01:49:29.020 --> 01:49:32.020
Now that I thought was eerie. The little swirlies.

01:49:32.020 --> 01:49:35.020
Like the Dreamcast had the swirly and the Xbox 360 has the swirly too.

01:49:35.020 --> 01:49:38.020
That is kind of eerie.

01:49:38.020 --> 01:49:40.020
Let's see here. Here's another one.

01:49:40.020 --> 01:49:44.020
Peter Moore spearheading the marketing for both systems.

01:49:44.020 --> 01:49:45.020
That's creepy.

01:49:45.020 --> 01:49:47.020
Let's see here.

01:49:47.020 --> 01:49:53.020
We've also got promise to be an evolutionary system to someday play DVDs.

01:49:53.020 --> 01:49:55.900
promise to be an evolutionary system someday to play

01:49:55.900 --> 01:49:57.700
hd dvds

01:49:57.700 --> 01:50:00.020
interested in our dreamcast

01:50:00.020 --> 01:50:01.220
end up supporting

01:50:01.220 --> 01:50:04.460
dvds eventually didn't know i didn't know they never did now i'm going to get

01:50:04.460 --> 01:50:07.300
you know i'm confusing because you could play vcd's you don't think the internet

01:50:07.300 --> 01:50:08.460
was yet to be

01:50:08.460 --> 01:50:09.460
uh... using it

01:50:09.460 --> 01:50:11.820
and then of course you know one of my favorites is

01:50:11.820 --> 01:50:15.660
for the dreamcast miller saw a two trailer so much of its next generation

01:50:15.660 --> 01:50:18.060
thunder and then for the access three sixty

01:50:18.060 --> 01:50:22.380
miller saw four trailer so much of its next generation thunder

01:50:22.380 --> 01:50:24.020
it'll be interesting to see what happens

01:50:24.020 --> 01:50:26.780
but then they go into another now there's a spin-off article now it's not

01:50:26.780 --> 01:50:29.940
all you know they're they're not trying to say xbox 360 is going to be

01:50:29.940 --> 01:50:30.980
definitely

01:50:30.980 --> 01:50:35.220
uh... you know fade away like the dreamcast did uh...

01:50:35.220 --> 01:50:40.460
they do say that there's things that the uh... exercise he has going for it

01:50:40.460 --> 01:50:42.500
that the dreamcast did not

01:50:42.500 --> 01:50:43.140
there's like a

01:50:43.140 --> 01:50:45.600
a sequel to the article on the on the site so

01:50:45.600 --> 01:50:48.700
this is all about a lot of stuff that

01:50:48.700 --> 01:50:53.400
You know, personally, it's just the people that are gonna be buying it aren't smart enough to, like, say,

01:50:53.400 --> 01:50:58.700
okay, Microsoft, you know, you're really holding back your allocations, you know, that's kind of pissing me off

01:50:58.700 --> 01:51:00.400
I'm gonna go buy something else.

01:51:00.400 --> 01:51:04.000
People aren't gonna do that. They're just gonna be like, well, I'm gonna wait, you know, or something,

01:51:04.000 --> 01:51:07.200
like, because it's the first system, next gen, that's coming out.

01:51:07.200 --> 01:51:12.400
And PlayStation 3, it's really, it's always on the fence with me.

01:51:12.400 --> 01:51:16.400
I'm not sure if it's gonna be a good system or not, because they keep saying,

01:51:16.400 --> 01:51:23.400
Oh, now there's a problem with it overheating. It's not coming out until 2007. Well, if this thing comes out in 2007, it's going to be too late.

01:51:23.400 --> 01:51:26.400
It's going to have lost the market share.

01:51:26.400 --> 01:51:30.400
Well, now, remember the golden rule of gaming, Dark Sakura?

01:51:30.400 --> 01:51:34.400
The system is only as good as the games on it.

01:51:34.400 --> 01:51:38.400
Xbox 360, though, it has some pretty good games on it. I'm most excited.

01:51:38.400 --> 01:51:43.200
They're launching better this time because they actually have something on it that is

01:51:43.200 --> 01:51:49.040
not a fighting, a driving, or sports title on it.

01:51:49.040 --> 01:51:53.760
They have, you know, like Cameo, and they have some other, you know, interesting titles

01:51:53.760 --> 01:51:54.760
around launch.

01:51:54.760 --> 01:51:58.720
The Elder Scrolls and stuff, so it's nice to see variety in their launch titles as well.

01:51:58.720 --> 01:51:59.720
No, no, no.

01:51:59.720 --> 01:52:01.720
They have Cameo.

01:52:01.720 --> 01:52:06.520
Well, on the actual launch day they have Cameo, but they have Elder Scrolls, you know, not

01:52:06.520 --> 01:52:07.520
that far out, right?

01:52:07.520 --> 01:52:08.880
right with the oval

01:52:08.880 --> 01:52:10.160
and the king kong

01:52:10.160 --> 01:52:13.800
is a little bit different to give it that and the first-person shooter still

01:52:13.800 --> 01:52:16.140
all sort of a moment

01:52:16.140 --> 01:52:18.920
but i was not much of a okay with

01:52:18.920 --> 01:52:23.080
yes so that they're coming out with some more stuff

01:52:23.080 --> 01:52:24.000
all right

01:52:24.000 --> 01:52:27.640
we're gonna break as we come after this break the long the promised we said we

01:52:27.640 --> 01:52:29.280

01:52:32.560 --> 01:52:33.440

so we're going to do some captain jack starting off this break and we'll be back with

01:53:04.060 --> 01:53:08.500
tonight's list-list regarding Guitar Hero 2, hypothetically. Of course it hasn't been

01:53:08.500 --> 01:53:12.780
announced yet, but come on. Come on. All they have to do is make their money back and they'll

01:53:12.780 --> 01:53:15.860
be a Guitar Hero 2. There's gotta be one. Alright, we'll be back after this. We'll start

01:53:15.860 --> 01:53:18.500
We're off with some Captain Jack 5th Mix style, yo.

01:53:45.860 --> 01:53:50.340
No matter what, I never forget that it didn't work

01:53:50.340 --> 01:53:52.580
I'm really smart guy

01:53:52.580 --> 01:53:57.300
I'm saying something we all know

01:53:57.300 --> 01:53:59.140
Da da da da la la

01:53:59.140 --> 01:54:00.980
Pi ya la pi ya la

01:54:00.980 --> 01:54:02.500
Da da da da da da

01:54:02.500 --> 01:54:04.340
Pi ya la pi ya la

01:54:04.340 --> 01:54:05.860
Da da da da da da

01:54:05.860 --> 01:54:07.540
Pi ya la pi

01:54:07.540 --> 01:54:10.980
Well if I could speak it now

01:54:10.980 --> 01:54:12.580
Da da da da la mi la

01:54:12.580 --> 01:54:14.420
Pi ya la pi ya la

01:54:44.420 --> 01:54:47.420
Tastic tambourine, pinot noir

01:54:47.420 --> 01:54:49.420
Oh, my tummy's drivin'

01:59:47.420 --> 01:59:54.420
This video is sponsored by the Orange Lab.

01:59:54.420 --> 02:00:01.420
This video is sponsored by the Orange Lab.

02:00:01.420 --> 02:00:23.660
Welcome back boys and girls to Orange Lounge Radio and I bet you kids are dying to know

02:00:23.660 --> 02:00:27.420
who won tonight's cage match because we had the votes tallied.

02:00:27.420 --> 02:00:33.120
So tonight's winner is a very, very, very close vote, by the way.

02:00:33.120 --> 02:00:35.360
Like all three songs, neck and neck and neck.

02:00:35.360 --> 02:00:39.640
In fact, tonight's vote was so close, we have a tie.

02:00:39.640 --> 02:00:42.020
A tie in tonight's cage match.

02:00:42.020 --> 02:00:43.540
So here are the songs that are tied.

02:00:43.540 --> 02:00:51.640
The first song that's tied tonight is Depeche Mode with Precious.

02:00:51.640 --> 02:01:02.240
And the second song that is tied tonight is 9 Inch Nails with Only.

02:01:02.240 --> 02:01:05.840
So apparently the chat room is feeling very emo, too, although there were quite a few

02:01:05.840 --> 02:01:09.340
votes for song number two, just not enough, unfortunately.

02:01:09.340 --> 02:01:13.240
So going to the Cage Match rulebook, the way we break a tie, the host who picked the song

02:01:13.240 --> 02:01:15.700
that did not tie gets to break the vote.

02:01:15.700 --> 02:01:17.520
So Loki, which song's gonna win?

02:01:17.520 --> 02:01:18.520
Depeche Mode.

02:01:18.520 --> 02:01:21.400
PESH MODE wins tonight's cage match.

02:01:21.400 --> 02:01:25.760
Any particular reason why you went for that one? I don't know, I just like the PESH MODE.

02:01:25.760 --> 02:01:27.220
Fair enough.

02:01:27.220 --> 02:01:30.660
PESH MODE wins tonight's cage match. It was the most emo of the two.

02:01:30.660 --> 02:01:32.560
You mean most emoist?

02:01:32.560 --> 02:01:33.940
Yeah.

02:01:33.940 --> 02:01:37.340
That's what, that's what, next week I'll be reppin'.

02:01:37.340 --> 02:01:38.480
Mamma Mia?

02:01:38.480 --> 02:01:43.380
No. Oh, can't wait. Actually, no, I won't be here next week, so yeah, Mamma Mia will be in the cage match.

02:01:43.380 --> 02:01:48.280
Okay. Well, in two weeks, we'll look forward to it. I won't even be here.

02:01:48.280 --> 02:01:53.280
You're gonna be at the, well, the Gay Frat House doesn't exist anymore, but you're gonna-

02:01:53.280 --> 02:01:54.280
The Gay Frat House is gone.

02:01:54.280 --> 02:01:55.280
That's too bad.

02:01:55.280 --> 02:02:02.280
I will be living it up in SoCo, where my, uh, harem of, uh, adoring-

02:02:02.280 --> 02:02:03.280
Wait, this is next week?

02:02:03.280 --> 02:02:04.280
Man players will be waiting for me.

02:02:04.280 --> 02:02:05.280
This is next week?

02:02:05.280 --> 02:02:08.280
Are you gonna go see Harry Potter down there?

02:02:08.280 --> 02:02:09.280
GASP!

02:02:09.280 --> 02:02:10.280
GASP!

02:02:10.280 --> 02:02:11.280
Harry Potter?

02:02:11.280 --> 02:02:16.280
Yeah, actually, because I'm gonna be staying with a, with a rather odd Harry Potter nerd.

02:02:16.280 --> 02:02:21.280
Now, the reason why you're going to be gone next week, you actually have a legitimate business purpose for being gone next week.

02:02:21.280 --> 02:02:22.280
We are doing this.

02:02:22.280 --> 02:02:25.280
Oh wait, next week. Oh, I'm sorry. This is the 16th.

02:02:25.280 --> 02:02:28.280
I thought it was the week after! How dare you!

02:02:28.280 --> 02:02:29.280
Well, I thought you made-

02:02:29.280 --> 02:02:30.280
Make my heart stop!

02:02:30.280 --> 02:02:31.280
Whatever.

02:02:33.280 --> 02:02:36.280
Speaking of which, I have nobody to go with because, um...

02:02:36.280 --> 02:02:38.280
You can come with us!

02:02:38.280 --> 02:02:40.280
Tim Agust doesn't like Harry Potter.

02:02:40.280 --> 02:02:42.280
You can come with us and screw him.

02:02:42.280 --> 02:02:45.280
Okay. Anybody want to come kidnap me?

02:02:45.280 --> 02:02:49.600
don't like literally screw him but you know

02:02:49.600 --> 02:02:52.960
i don't do it anyway you sicko

02:02:52.960 --> 02:02:54.080
anyway

02:02:54.080 --> 02:02:57.280
uh... no but uh... but that's not going to be gone next week for a legitimate

02:02:57.280 --> 02:03:02.600
business purpose right out of where you're going to meet my adoring fans

02:03:02.600 --> 02:03:05.920
at the podcast awards alright

02:03:05.920 --> 02:03:09.080
i'm going to be there

02:03:09.080 --> 02:03:11.360
in all of my uh... dark glory

02:03:11.360 --> 02:03:13.660
i didn't go because he wouldn't give me any like

02:03:13.660 --> 02:03:16.540
time in the mike you'd be like

02:03:16.540 --> 02:03:17.780
thank you for

02:03:17.780 --> 02:03:21.580
and there is another thing you know i let you get to go up there and go it's

02:03:21.580 --> 02:03:23.780
so much fun and you cut off

02:03:23.780 --> 02:03:26.180
but the meanwhile i would like

02:03:26.180 --> 02:03:27.660
i'd like to think

02:03:27.660 --> 02:03:29.940
if you get that you know if you get actually go up there and you know you

02:03:29.940 --> 02:03:31.740

02:03:31.740 --> 02:03:35.260
so i'm actually gonna say it's so much fun in your speech i hope so no

02:03:35.260 --> 02:03:36.580
called damn

02:03:36.580 --> 02:03:39.620
will record it or something as we were here

02:03:39.620 --> 02:03:42.340
and and i'm going to say

02:03:42.340 --> 02:03:43.460
GIVE ME A DOOR!

02:03:44.180 --> 02:03:45.180
If you'll sit down.

02:03:47.280 --> 02:03:49.280
Don't embarrass us, DarkSockra.

02:03:50.020 --> 02:03:51.020
I never do.

02:03:51.200 --> 02:03:53.200
It's just a representation of the show.

02:03:53.200 --> 02:03:55.200
Could you please thank my mother while you're down there?

02:03:56.000 --> 02:03:58.000
I THANK YOUR MOTHER!

02:03:59.500 --> 02:04:02.500
I'd like to thank your mom!

02:04:03.660 --> 02:04:04.660
Alright.

02:04:04.660 --> 02:04:08.340
Uh, we're gonna get into tonight's list list very shortly, but I do want to give a little bit of a reminder.

02:04:08.340 --> 02:04:10.340
Ultramix3, right around the corner.

02:04:10.340 --> 02:04:13.340
Ultramix 3's got a damn impressive lineup. Is that out this Tuesday, I think?

02:04:13.340 --> 02:04:14.340
Next week.

02:04:14.340 --> 02:04:15.340
Next week?

02:04:15.340 --> 02:04:16.340
It's the week of the 14th.

02:04:16.340 --> 02:04:18.340
Ah hell, I heard it was leaking early, I don't know.

02:04:18.340 --> 02:04:19.340
Wait a minute.

02:04:19.340 --> 02:04:23.340
I swear to God, again I'm going to go broke before my birthday, right Rob?

02:04:23.340 --> 02:04:31.340
You also have that same week, Flow, the urban dance uprising, in case you feel a little bit like a breakbeat mood and you have the extra money to waste on stuff.

02:04:31.340 --> 02:04:39.340
Yeah, like I said, Ultramix 3 is coming out and I know a lot of you guys are going to buy Ultramix 3 and you wouldn't want to buy any other dancing game except Ultramix 3 that day.

02:04:39.340 --> 02:04:45.220
Alright, um, oh I wanted to mention something about DDR Mario too, I keep putting off the

02:04:45.220 --> 02:04:50.060
list list, but um, DDR Mario, there's been tournaments going on like everywhere, there's

02:04:50.060 --> 02:04:53.740
actually one here in Sacramento, I don't know if you guys heard of this, I didn't go, however

02:04:53.740 --> 02:04:58.580
I heard that a whopping five people entered the tournament, so congratulations to whoever

02:04:58.580 --> 02:04:59.580
won out of those five people.

02:04:59.580 --> 02:05:00.580
Was it?

02:05:00.580 --> 02:05:01.580
A free copy of Mario DDR.

02:05:01.580 --> 02:05:02.580
Was it Andrew?

02:05:02.580 --> 02:05:07.180
I don't know, no I don't think it was him that won, I think it was somebody else.

02:05:07.180 --> 02:05:11.060
I don't know who won, but I know who posted about it.

02:05:11.060 --> 02:05:13.740
Uh, yeah, explicit. Anyway, yeah.

02:05:13.740 --> 02:05:16.920
I don't know who won. We'll have to find out from him.

02:05:16.920 --> 02:05:19.540
I'm sure they did a fabulous job and

02:05:19.540 --> 02:05:22.500
earned their Mario DDR, which is a game I don't think I'm going to buy.

02:05:22.500 --> 02:05:23.500
Honestly, I'm just...

02:05:23.500 --> 02:05:26.360
I'm not feeling the Mario DDR. I love Nintendo,

02:05:26.360 --> 02:05:27.700
I love DDR,

02:05:27.700 --> 02:05:32.220
but I'm not feeling the Mario DDR. It's just not... I know it would last five minutes.

02:05:32.220 --> 02:05:34.580
The honeymoon would be over before it begins.

02:05:34.580 --> 02:05:38.300
Hey, Walt, you know what you have to steal your money instead?

02:05:38.300 --> 02:05:40.000
Mario Party 7

02:05:40.000 --> 02:05:41.420
Okay, I'll go with that, because

02:05:41.420 --> 02:05:45.540
I love playing Mario Party 7 because I'm an evil bitch when I play as Peach in that game.

02:05:45.540 --> 02:05:47.460
I'm a vindictive motherfucker. They need

02:05:47.460 --> 02:05:48.520
DS

02:05:48.520 --> 02:05:50.160
Mario Party

02:05:50.160 --> 02:05:55.300
so we can get some Wi-Fi going. I hope that was a rumor, something that was in development was the DS Mario Party.

02:05:55.300 --> 02:06:00.600
We'll see though, because think about all the minigames, because the minigames are starting to get a little stale, but think about all the new stuff they could do with the pen.

02:06:00.600 --> 02:06:02.560
Yeah. Be fun.

02:06:02.560 --> 02:06:06.720
All right, let's get into tonight's Listless.

02:06:06.720 --> 02:06:08.840
All right.

02:06:08.840 --> 02:06:11.080
The way that Listless works, because it's been a hell of a

02:06:11.080 --> 02:06:14.120
long time since we've done one of these segments, what we're

02:06:14.120 --> 02:06:16.920
going to do is each of us here in studio, so it would be the

02:06:16.920 --> 02:06:19.480
three hosts, myself, Dark Sakura, and Loki, and then our

02:06:19.480 --> 02:06:21.360
special guest, Angel, because Buzz left.

02:06:21.360 --> 02:06:23.760
He decided to go watch Family Guy or something.

02:06:23.760 --> 02:06:28.600
We're each going to put in three entries, basically, or

02:06:28.600 --> 02:06:32.400
three answers, statements, to tonight's topic.

02:06:32.400 --> 02:06:36.800
Tonight's topic is song we most want to see in Guitar Hero 2.

02:06:36.800 --> 02:06:39.900
Okay, so we're each going to name three songs, but then there's a twist!

02:06:39.900 --> 02:06:41.500
What's a twist?

02:06:41.500 --> 02:06:45.900
The twist tonight, as it is every night when we do Listless, is that then we go around the room

02:06:45.900 --> 02:06:50.100
and each person gets to take one thing off of the list.

02:06:50.100 --> 02:06:51.400
Oh, snap!

02:06:51.400 --> 02:06:55.300
All right, and then you guys in chat, you get to vote on your favorite,

02:06:55.300 --> 02:06:59.700
and then we come up through this highly scientific process we call Listless

02:06:59.700 --> 02:07:04.460
of the top three songs we want to see in Guitar Hero 2.

02:07:04.460 --> 02:07:08.980
Alright, so that being said, let's start it off. Everybody ready to go? Got their three songs?

02:07:08.980 --> 02:07:12.620
Uh, there we go. Alright, Angel, you're lowest on the totem pole.

02:07:12.620 --> 02:07:17.900
You start us off. Just messing with you. What's your number three pick?

02:07:17.900 --> 02:07:21.980
Uh, I don't want you on a boat.

02:07:21.980 --> 02:07:26.300
Uh, anything from Dragon Force. You guys are like, huh?

02:07:26.300 --> 02:07:28.300
Okay, you gotta explain that one.

02:07:56.300 --> 02:07:58.580
I'm gonna Google that, go ahead.

02:07:58.580 --> 02:08:00.100
All right, anything by Dragon Force,

02:08:00.100 --> 02:08:01.900
first thing on tonight's list.

02:08:01.900 --> 02:08:03.820
We'll go over, I'll go next.

02:08:03.820 --> 02:08:06.980
My number three pick for tonight's list

02:08:06.980 --> 02:08:10.140
is the song Bitch by Meredith Brooks.

02:08:10.140 --> 02:08:10.980
And I don't know if you remember,

02:08:10.980 --> 02:08:12.940
this song from the 90s was kind of a one-hit wonder.

02:08:12.940 --> 02:08:14.460
I'm a bitch.

02:08:14.460 --> 02:08:16.900
I actually met this woman once, she was really nice,

02:08:16.900 --> 02:08:19.180
and she actually is a really good guitar player,

02:08:19.180 --> 02:08:21.380
and that's something people never really picked up about her

02:08:21.380 --> 02:08:23.380
but she's inspired by Hendrix and all those people.

02:08:23.380 --> 02:08:25.140
She's a really good guitar player,

02:08:25.140 --> 02:08:32.140
and i just want to play bitch on guitar hero that would rock so uh... that's my pick for number three song

02:08:32.140 --> 02:08:38.420
uh... my number three song is going to be kenny loggins with danger zone

02:08:38.420 --> 02:08:39.660
that song

02:08:39.660 --> 02:08:45.300
granted it's really cheesy and stuff but it's really a good guitar song

02:08:45.300 --> 02:08:49.620
is that the same one from top gun? yep that would be the same one from top gun

02:08:49.620 --> 02:08:53.320
uh... i thought that the queen of the show you to the last and number three

02:08:53.320 --> 02:09:00.320
uh... eighty-three harry to hell

02:09:00.400 --> 02:09:04.820
i'm going up the ones that we see now we're talking talking highway to hell

02:09:04.820 --> 02:09:06.500
although

02:09:06.500 --> 02:09:11.500
although i can't fucking stand that guy's voice

02:09:11.500 --> 02:09:16.420
well i almost put in big balls

02:09:16.420 --> 02:09:18.100
i love

02:09:18.100 --> 02:09:24.920
I love the guitar. So that would be a bad ass song to play in Guitar Hero. I definitely support you. I will not take that off the list, I guarantee you.

02:09:24.920 --> 02:09:28.140
Alright, let's go around to the number two picks.

02:09:28.140 --> 02:09:31.120
Uh, Angel, what's your number two pick?

02:09:31.120 --> 02:09:32.020
Pearl Jam.

02:09:32.020 --> 02:09:33.920
Uh...

02:09:33.920 --> 02:09:36.900
Either...

02:09:36.900 --> 02:09:40.960
Let's see, fine, Alive.

02:09:40.960 --> 02:09:44.940
That's a good band to have in Guitar Hero, Pearl Jam. We kind of missed some in the last one.

02:09:44.940 --> 02:09:48.580
that's ok alive by pearl jam angel's number two pick

02:09:48.580 --> 02:09:50.220
loki what's your number two pick

02:09:50.220 --> 02:09:52.540
uh... my number two pick

02:09:52.540 --> 02:09:54.380
what was the toss up

02:09:54.380 --> 02:10:01.380
filter with hayman nice shot

02:10:04.260 --> 02:10:07.260
is it true that that song is about some guy that killed himself or something

02:10:07.260 --> 02:10:08.860
i have no idea

02:10:08.860 --> 02:10:11.140
ehhh kirkamabes

02:10:11.140 --> 02:10:13.700
no that's tasteless

02:10:13.700 --> 02:10:15.940
I shit you not.

02:10:15.940 --> 02:10:17.140
Wow, alright.

02:10:17.140 --> 02:10:22.660
Uh, my number two pick, uh, my number two pick for a song that should be in Guitar Hero 2 would be

02:10:22.660 --> 02:10:25.480
Uh, Are You Gonna Go My Way by Lenny Kravitz.

02:10:25.480 --> 02:10:29.620
Cause that song's badass and it has a great guitar riff in it.

02:10:29.620 --> 02:10:35.080
So I'm gonna, uh, do that. Are You Gonna Go My Way by Lenny Kravitz.

02:10:35.080 --> 02:10:37.440
Dark Soccer, your number two pick.

02:10:37.440 --> 02:10:39.500
Um, I'm going...

02:10:39.500 --> 02:10:41.060
God damn this stupid thing.

02:10:41.060 --> 02:10:42.640
Um...

02:10:42.640 --> 02:10:48.080
I'm gonna have to go with, um, Metallica, and I've had a hard time narrowing it down,

02:10:48.080 --> 02:10:51.800
because I... there's just a whole bunch of fuckin' good Metallica songs.

02:10:51.800 --> 02:10:54.200
So I'd have to say, um...

02:10:57.960 --> 02:10:59.480
Mmm...

02:10:59.480 --> 02:11:03.240
Yeah, actually, I'm gonna have to go with, uh, Master of Puppets.

02:11:03.240 --> 02:11:06.920
Okay, th-thank you, I'm glad she changed her mind at the last minute and decided not to do a new song.

02:11:06.920 --> 02:11:13.920
a master of puppets by Metallica. Badass, I'm liking this list so far. We got some good

02:11:15.800 --> 02:11:21.400
shit on here. We're going to rock out on Guitar Hero 2. I hope Red Octane's listening. Angel,

02:11:21.400 --> 02:11:27.920
your number one pick for song you most want to see in fucking Guitar Hero 2. I'm going

02:11:27.920 --> 02:11:34.920
to scare you guys with this one. Rainbow with Stargazer. Just because the guitar in that

02:11:34.920 --> 02:11:35.920
and that's pretty cool.

02:11:35.920 --> 02:11:38.920
I have a massive question mark over my head.

02:11:38.920 --> 02:11:39.920
Really?

02:11:39.920 --> 02:11:40.920
Richie Blackmore.

02:11:40.920 --> 02:11:41.920
Anyway, yeah, 1976.

02:11:41.920 --> 02:11:43.920
You don't want to know.

02:11:43.920 --> 02:11:44.920
Okay, some classic stuff.

02:11:44.920 --> 02:11:46.920
Some old classic stuff.

02:11:46.920 --> 02:11:48.920
Stargazer by Rainbow.

02:11:48.920 --> 02:11:49.920
Alright.

02:11:49.920 --> 02:11:52.920
Loki, your number one pick for Song of the Audit.

02:11:52.920 --> 02:11:54.920
Damn well, better be in Guitar Hero 2.

02:11:54.920 --> 02:12:02.920
Uh, Soundgarden with Black Hole Sun.

02:12:02.920 --> 02:12:03.920
Nice pick.

02:12:03.920 --> 02:12:06.760
sign that by sound i didn't get it

02:12:06.760 --> 02:12:08.060
and if

02:12:08.060 --> 02:12:10.560
if we are still going to get to uh...

02:12:10.560 --> 02:12:13.900
if we had to be out of that's what i feel that it is all tied by the who

02:12:13.900 --> 02:12:17.000
doesn't love but i don't think you know that if they could do it where they

02:12:17.000 --> 02:12:20.500
played a video in the background of the stage while they're

02:12:20.500 --> 02:12:22.780
just don't mind that i have been

02:12:22.780 --> 02:12:24.780
monitor in amplitude they did that

02:12:24.780 --> 02:12:29.020
i remember you can see that the point twenty-two video and i want some

02:12:29.020 --> 02:12:32.580
all right my number one picture song i would most want to see you tired here

02:12:32.580 --> 02:12:33.620
too

02:12:33.620 --> 02:12:36.620
would be more human than human by white zombie?

02:12:36.620 --> 02:12:37.620
Shit yeah.

02:12:38.620 --> 02:12:41.120
I am the red moon down, look at that blue moon.

02:12:41.120 --> 02:12:44.120
I love that song, so we're gonna do more human than human by white zombie.

02:12:45.120 --> 02:12:47.120
Dark soccer, your number one pick.

02:12:48.120 --> 02:12:51.120
It was a really tough thing for me to think of,

02:12:51.120 --> 02:12:54.120
um, however I'm gonna go with blur song two.

02:12:54.120 --> 02:12:55.620
So, woohoo!

02:12:55.620 --> 02:12:58.120
One, three people who only know it as the woohoo song.

02:12:58.120 --> 02:13:01.620
I knew that blur gorillas would be on your list somewhere,

02:13:01.620 --> 02:13:07.860
that's a good choice not at all i think there's no other way okay but i think more people

02:13:07.860 --> 02:13:12.580
of course more people know you know everybody knows that one so yeah am i allowed to kill one

02:13:14.260 --> 02:13:21.860
no i mean yes okay what uh change dragon force i can't believe i said that but change dragon force

02:13:21.860 --> 02:13:22.860
to

02:13:22.860 --> 02:13:24.660
uh...

02:13:24.660 --> 02:13:26.660
Foo Fighters Everlong

02:13:26.660 --> 02:13:30.420
Everlong?

02:13:30.420 --> 02:13:33.500
Alright, so here's the list as it stands so far.

02:13:33.500 --> 02:13:35.340
Everlong by Foo Fighters

02:13:35.340 --> 02:13:37.060
Bitch by Meredith Brooks

02:13:37.060 --> 02:13:39.140
Danger Zone by Kenny Loggins

02:13:39.140 --> 02:13:41.420
Highway to Hell by ACDC

02:13:41.420 --> 02:13:43.220
Alive by Pearl Jam

02:13:43.220 --> 02:13:45.460
Hey Man Nice Shot by Filter

02:13:45.460 --> 02:13:47.660
Are You Gonna Go My Way by Lenny Kravitz

02:13:47.660 --> 02:13:49.780
Master of Puppets by Metallica

02:13:49.780 --> 02:13:51.700
Stargazer by Rainbow

02:13:51.700 --> 02:13:57.700
Black Hole Sun by Soundgarden, More Human Than Human by White Zombie, Song 2 by Blur.

02:13:57.700 --> 02:14:00.700
You know what, fuck, let's just send this to Red Octane and say this is what we want.

02:14:00.700 --> 02:14:03.700
I mean, this is a great list right here. This is an awesome list.

02:14:03.700 --> 02:14:05.700
As you know, I do think that our top three, we actually should say,

02:14:05.700 --> 02:14:10.700
hey, all of the listeners of Warriors Lounge Radio voted and want these songs in the next game.

02:14:10.700 --> 02:14:13.700
You know what's interesting about this list, though? No Nirvana.

02:14:13.700 --> 02:14:17.700
We have Foo Fighters, I was thinking it.

02:14:17.700 --> 02:14:21.700
I was mentioned that I almost put it in with the White Snake, Here I Go Again.

02:14:21.700 --> 02:14:27.700
Oh, so many good songs. This can only be the beginning of many great songs. There's many, many great songs.

02:14:27.700 --> 02:14:31.700
Obviously we missed some big ones, but these are the ones that are near and dear to our heart.

02:14:31.700 --> 02:14:37.700
If this is going to be tough, I know I say this every week that it's going to be tough to eliminate songs on the list, but tonight especially, this one is going to suck.

02:14:37.700 --> 02:14:43.700
Because this is a really good list, but we have to do it. It's part of the game. Let's start taking them off. Angel.

02:14:43.700 --> 02:14:48.700
Oh, no. I can't do this! No!

02:14:48.700 --> 02:14:53.700
Uh... Oh, geez.

02:14:53.700 --> 02:14:55.700
Danger Zone.

02:14:55.700 --> 02:15:00.700
Alright, say goodbye to Top Gun. Danger Zone by Kenny Loggins coming off the list.

02:15:00.700 --> 02:15:03.700
Loki, what are you taking off the list?

02:15:03.700 --> 02:15:08.700
Um...

02:15:08.700 --> 02:15:12.700
I'm just gonna have to take off Bitch, it's just not as rocking as the rest of them.

02:15:13.700 --> 02:15:17.700
I wasn't too attached to that song being there, I just kinda had to throw that in there, cause you know, I'm a bitch.

02:15:17.700 --> 02:15:18.700
I would have.

02:15:18.700 --> 02:15:22.700
Yeah, so, um, my turn to take something off, I...

02:15:22.700 --> 02:15:28.700
This is tough, and I apologize, but I kinda got the question mark with this song too, and maybe it's just because I'm uncultured.

02:15:28.700 --> 02:15:32.700
I have to take Stargazer by Rainbow off the list, I just, I'm sorry.

02:15:32.700 --> 02:15:34.700
People, pick up two of my picks!

02:15:34.700 --> 02:15:40.700
No, that's fine, um, I can send you the song later and you're probably gonna, like, kill

02:15:40.700 --> 02:15:44.700
yourself later, cause you'll be like, oh, why did I take that off?

02:15:44.700 --> 02:15:49.700
No, you know, you got ACDC and you got, oh, oh, you mean, oh, I thought you meant-

02:15:49.700 --> 02:15:51.700
You made me hit the hard choices!

02:15:51.700 --> 02:15:53.700
Yeah, we'll leave you with a very hard choice, Darksider.

02:15:53.700 --> 02:15:58.700
Here's the list, Everlong, Highway to Hell, Alive, Hey Man Nice Shot, Are You Gonna Go

02:15:58.700 --> 02:16:03.700
My Way, Master of Puppets, Black Hole Sun, More Human Than Human, Song 2, you got a very

02:16:03.700 --> 02:16:07.980
you get a very difficult choice. You're not gonna make any friends either way, so you

02:16:07.980 --> 02:16:16.980
might as well just get it over with. Thank you. Just rip the band-aid off. DMD, Si.

02:16:16.980 --> 02:16:21.700
Everlong. Everlong by Foo Fighters. Tough choice, though. Of all of them, that one's

02:16:21.700 --> 02:16:25.900
my least favorite. That was a tough choice. Alright, so here it is. This is the one you

02:16:25.900 --> 02:16:30.780
guys get to vote on, so send us your pick. Your number one pick and we will determine

02:16:30.780 --> 02:16:37.500

by White Zombie, and Song 2 by Blur. Alright, send a private message to Sky with your vote.

02:16:57.820 --> 02:17:04.820

02:17:06.640 --> 02:17:12.720
to blame for that, you know. I know. Bleached asshole. Alright, so we will reveal the definitive

02:17:12.720 --> 02:17:19.120
list a little later in the program. And I will personally throw up on the doorstep of

02:17:19.120 --> 02:17:25.680
Red Octane if they ever put corn or Slipknot in it. Okay, corn I could deal with. Corn's

02:17:25.680 --> 02:17:30.880
pretty cool until like until they hit MTV corn was very cool like adidas you

02:17:30.880 --> 02:17:34.520
know all day I dream about that that was a cool song but you know when they kind

02:17:34.520 --> 02:17:39.520
of you know started being on MTV all the time I didn't dig him so much but no

02:17:39.520 --> 02:17:45.840
slipknot no please no please God no however guar would be awesome

02:17:45.840 --> 02:17:50.140
See, all of Winona's big down beaver.

02:17:50.140 --> 02:17:51.540
Winona's big down beaver.

02:17:51.540 --> 02:17:52.540
Winona's...

02:17:52.540 --> 02:17:54.160
Oh my God I forgot about that song.

02:17:54.160 --> 02:17:56.080
That song was badass.

02:17:56.080 --> 02:17:59.820
My ex boyfriend in Alabama was like the worlds biggest Primus fan.

02:17:59.820 --> 02:18:07.520
So we would go down his civic MRX playing Primus at like downtown Mobile and then all

02:18:07.520 --> 02:18:09.560
the old people would wake up.

02:18:09.560 --> 02:18:12.440
Or just the theme song to South Park.

02:18:12.440 --> 02:18:19.120
So those votes are coming in there into the chat right now.

02:18:19.120 --> 02:18:20.120
Let's talk a little bit real quick.

02:18:20.120 --> 02:18:23.360
We are going to take a quick break so we can allow all the votes to come in.

02:18:23.360 --> 02:18:27.680
However, I want to definitely plug some of the spin-off programming here on Orange Launch

02:18:27.680 --> 02:18:28.680
Radio.

02:18:28.680 --> 02:18:32.400
And we'll start it off with Monday nights on the station.

02:18:32.400 --> 02:18:35.800
Extrofer, who's not here tonight, he's spending some quality family time, his sister's over

02:18:35.800 --> 02:18:37.200
and I think they're watching a movie.

02:18:37.200 --> 02:18:40.920
So Extrofer has his show on Monday nights, it's Extrofer's Case of the Mondays.

02:18:40.920 --> 02:18:46.920
And it'll definitely clear up any Monday blahs that you were having with his very frank and

02:18:46.920 --> 02:18:48.000
honest talk.

02:18:48.000 --> 02:18:53.600
And last week on the show, he had John on the show last week, and John doesn't even

02:18:53.600 --> 02:18:58.280
play games, really, although I did catch him playing Final Fantasy VI once, but it's the

02:18:58.280 --> 02:19:01.700
show where they kind of talk about games, but they talk about cool stuff, too.

02:19:01.700 --> 02:19:05.360
So if you just want to have a good time, Monday nights on the station is extra first case

02:19:05.360 --> 02:19:06.360
of the Mondays.

02:19:06.360 --> 02:19:08.320
Now, Tuesday nights is also a very good time.

02:19:08.320 --> 02:19:09.320
Why is that dark soccer?

02:19:09.320 --> 02:19:16.680
Because I rule the radio. It's pump up the volume and this week actually by popular

02:19:16.680 --> 02:19:23.320
requests we are having the Margaret show-a-thon. Very cool. Wednesday nights

02:19:23.320 --> 02:19:26.680
on the station is the Rob Roberts show. Last week on Rob Roberts show Rice

02:19:26.680 --> 02:19:30.720
Princess and Lanky Style stopped by. We had a pretty good time. However they're

02:19:30.720 --> 02:19:33.080
not going to be here next week but we're still going to have a really good show.

02:19:33.080 --> 02:19:36.980
I'm very excited about the show this week. I think this is the week I'm going

02:19:36.980 --> 02:19:41.580
do my 80s marathon because fucking a I love the 80s and actually you know what

02:19:41.580 --> 02:19:48.420

02:19:51.300 --> 02:19:55.380
Wednesday on the Rob Roberts show and also I like to somebody said I just sit

02:20:14.380 --> 02:20:20.620
orange launch radio Thursdays and Fridays to come soon maybe we'll see so

02:20:20.620 --> 02:20:30.140
all right angel comment maybe maybe we'll see what happens all right so

02:20:30.140 --> 02:20:34.820
So, while we're, uh, finishing getting your votes, um, we would start the FUs of the Week

02:20:34.820 --> 02:20:38.340
normally, but I can't, I don't want both those things to overlap each other with the private

02:20:38.340 --> 02:20:39.340
messages.

02:20:39.340 --> 02:20:40.340
I can only handle so much.

02:20:40.340 --> 02:20:43.180
So we're gonna do a quick break, and then we're gonna come back, reveal the winners

02:20:43.180 --> 02:20:47.020
of tonight's list list, and, so get those votes in now, and we're gonna move into the

02:20:47.020 --> 02:20:51.100
FUs of the Week, because I know y'all are angsty, and Dark Sakura has a new theme song

02:20:51.100 --> 02:20:56.300
for her FUs tonight, and I'll tell you what, it's probably the best damn FU theme song

02:20:56.300 --> 02:20:57.300
yet, I think.

02:20:57.300 --> 02:20:58.300
It is.

02:20:58.300 --> 02:20:59.300
I forgot what I picked.

02:20:59.300 --> 02:21:03.940
Well, you'll find out when we get back or if you're nice, I'll tell you during the break

02:21:06.380 --> 02:21:09.220
So we'll be back after this in this break

02:21:09.220 --> 02:21:14.420
I think what we're gonna do is you know, I had some people requesting this even though we played it on last week's show

02:21:14.860 --> 02:21:19.180
This song is just so cool. I don't know how you cannot like this song

02:21:19.300 --> 02:21:24.820
so we have to I give it its due and I apologize though because oh

02:21:24.820 --> 02:21:33.380
Oh shit, if I can find it, uh oh, we'll try to get to it during the break at some point.

02:21:33.380 --> 02:21:35.260
I can't find it all of a sudden.

02:21:35.260 --> 02:21:39.220
We'll be back, how embarrassing is that, oh well.

02:21:39.220 --> 02:21:43.700
We'll try and get to that song, but in the meantime you get some other songs.

02:21:43.700 --> 02:21:49.140
We'll start it off with something from UltraMix 2, because we haven't played a lot of newer

02:21:49.140 --> 02:21:50.620
stuff tonight.

02:21:50.620 --> 02:21:54.180
So we'll do an UltraMix 2 song, and we'll be back after this.

02:21:54.180 --> 02:21:56.180
So we're going to start it off with Toe Jam.

02:21:56.180 --> 02:22:03.180
You're listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

02:23:56.180 --> 02:24:03.180
This is not dead air, it's just that this song has a very quiet opening, so you'll just

02:24:03.180 --> 02:24:10.180
just that this song has a very quiet opening so you'll just have to deal with it a little bit.

02:24:33.180 --> 02:24:36.080
Istanbul, now Constantinople, been a long time gone

02:24:36.080 --> 02:24:39.180
Constantinople, now it's Thursday night, on a moon late night

02:24:39.180 --> 02:24:42.180
Every gal in Constantinople lives in Istanbul

02:24:42.180 --> 02:24:44.180
Now Constantinople, so view the day

02:24:44.180 --> 02:24:47.180
In Constantinople, she'll be waiting in Istanbul

02:24:47.180 --> 02:24:51.680
Even old New York, was once New Amsterdam

02:24:51.680 --> 02:24:53.680
Why they changed and I can't say

02:24:53.680 --> 02:24:55.680
People just liked it better that way

02:24:55.680 --> 02:24:57.680
So take me back to Constantinople

02:24:57.680 --> 02:25:01.180
No you can't go back to Constantinople, been a long time gone

02:25:01.180 --> 02:25:04.180
Constantinople, why did Constantinople get the works?

02:25:04.180 --> 02:25:07.180
That's so what it is about the Turks

02:25:14.180 --> 02:25:16.180
Istanbul

02:25:23.180 --> 02:25:26.180
Istanbul, even old New York

02:25:26.180 --> 02:25:28.180
Was once New Amsterdam

02:25:28.180 --> 02:25:30.180
Why they changed it, I can't say

02:25:30.180 --> 02:25:32.180
You just liked it better that way!

02:25:32.180 --> 02:25:34.180
Constantinople was Constantinople

02:25:34.180 --> 02:25:36.180
Now it's Istanbul, now Constantinople

02:25:36.180 --> 02:25:38.180
They're a long time gone

02:25:38.180 --> 02:25:40.180
And Constantinople, why did Constantinople get the works?

02:25:40.180 --> 02:25:44.180
That's nobody's, it's by the Turks

02:25:44.180 --> 02:26:13.540
So take me back to Constantinople No you can't go back to Constantinople

02:26:13.540 --> 02:26:16.660
It's been a long time gone, Constantinople had a Constantinople

02:26:16.660 --> 02:26:22.780
Get the works, that's nobody's business but the Turks

02:26:22.780 --> 02:26:27.980
HISTANBO!

02:27:52.780 --> 02:28:20.780
Let's listen in on an Orange Lounge Radio staff meeting.

02:28:20.780 --> 02:28:22.780
Do we want to be accepted by Hollywood?

02:28:22.780 --> 02:28:24.780
No!

02:28:24.780 --> 02:28:26.780
Do we care what people think of us?

02:28:26.780 --> 02:28:28.780
No!

02:28:28.780 --> 02:28:30.780
Do we want people to kiss our ass?

02:28:30.780 --> 02:28:32.780
Yes!

02:28:34.780 --> 02:28:40.780
Extreme Bamani Radio, that's us, Orange Lounge Radio.

02:28:42.780 --> 02:28:45.780
Alright, we're back in the list list.

02:28:45.780 --> 02:28:51.860
We're about to reveal the definitive list as voted by you the chat room of the three songs

02:28:52.100 --> 02:28:58.700
You most want to see in guitar hero 2 you guys ready for this. What do you think? What do you think one?

02:29:00.300 --> 02:29:02.300
Early guesses

02:29:06.580 --> 02:29:09.400
Apathetic people no bleached asshole fun

02:29:09.400 --> 02:29:22.160
The number three pick you guys want to see in Guitar Hero 2, Highway to Hell by ACDC.

02:29:22.160 --> 02:29:31.560
The number two song you most want to see in Listless, song two by Blur.

02:29:31.560 --> 02:29:36.280
And the number one song you bitches want to see in Guitar Hero 2, buy a landslide might

02:29:36.280 --> 02:29:41.220
I had by a freaking landslide vote master of puppets by Metallica

02:29:44.100 --> 02:29:50.760
Knew that would happen. Yeah, by the way all three on the list. Yeah, those were all three of Jamie's pics

02:30:00.980 --> 02:30:03.420
You know, it's funny is that though it was in a different order

02:30:03.420 --> 02:30:05.420
So don't get too cocky over there.

02:30:05.420 --> 02:30:07.420
Oh, just only two songs for me to turn around.

02:30:09.420 --> 02:30:12.420
This is because not everybody appreciates we're the way I do.

02:30:15.420 --> 02:30:18.420
Some other votes, though, too. You know, Are You Gonna Go My Way was a very...

02:30:18.420 --> 02:30:20.420
It was like a fourth, so, you know, it wasn't all...

02:30:20.420 --> 02:30:22.420
It wasn't all, Jamie.

02:30:23.420 --> 02:30:25.420
All right, anyway, we're about ready to get in.

02:30:25.420 --> 02:30:28.420
Yeah, now I'm in the mood where I want to get into the FUs of the week.

02:30:28.420 --> 02:30:31.420
I don't know if you guys are feeling angsty, but I certainly am.

02:30:31.420 --> 02:30:36.420
Now, DarkSakura, you changed your theme song yet again.

02:30:36.420 --> 02:30:44.420
Yeah, that's just because I wasn't too pleased with the last one I picked.

02:30:44.420 --> 02:30:46.420
Okay, well, you have a brand new FU of the Week song.

02:30:46.420 --> 02:30:49.420
I think I'm going to stick with this one because it's powerful.

02:30:49.420 --> 02:30:53.420
This is a badass FU song, and I can't believe it's taken us 163 episodes to get to this.

02:30:53.420 --> 02:30:54.420
This is an FU song.

02:30:54.420 --> 02:30:55.420
Ooh!

02:30:55.420 --> 02:30:56.420
Rock!

02:30:56.420 --> 02:30:57.420
Speaking of rock.

02:30:57.420 --> 02:30:58.420
I've been scared of the horns a lot.

02:30:58.420 --> 02:31:04.420
Alright, so, um, here we go, Dark Sakura, why is it that we do the FUs of the week every single week?

02:31:04.420 --> 02:31:07.420
Cuz we're freakin' pissed off!

02:31:13.420 --> 02:31:15.420
MURDER!

02:31:17.420 --> 02:31:21.420
Oh, yeah, this makes me feel mighty.

02:31:21.420 --> 02:31:25.420
Um, my first FU goes toward...

02:31:25.420 --> 02:31:28.420
Migraines! Yes, migraines!

02:31:28.420 --> 02:31:34.420
Because it means that my brain is broken and they want me to go in for a CT scan.

02:31:34.420 --> 02:31:40.420
The nephew goes to the stuff they gave me to help with the horrible migraines.

02:31:40.420 --> 02:31:45.420
Because, well, it makes me lightheaded and feel like I'm drunk without being drunk.

02:31:45.420 --> 02:31:50.420
If I'm going to feel drunk, I want the benefit of booze to feel drunk.

02:31:50.420 --> 02:32:00.420
kostjamrh and people who decide to pull into my lane, they think, toward me.

02:32:00.420 --> 02:32:15.420
An F.U. goes toward the McDonalds, over here by Rob's house, for being rather dumb.

02:32:15.420 --> 02:32:18.420
You know what's funny is all three of us went there tonight. I think that's hilarious.

02:32:18.420 --> 02:32:21.420
And ask you to get a family in front of me because I really would get them.

02:32:25.420 --> 02:32:28.420
A nephew toward me not having much time to do stuff.

02:32:28.420 --> 02:32:32.420
Also a nephew to me not having the whole week to procrastinate on my homework.

02:32:32.420 --> 02:32:37.420
So I have to do homework tonight, homework Monday, homework Wednesday,

02:32:37.420 --> 02:32:39.420
and get it all done before I leave Thursday.

02:32:41.420 --> 02:32:43.420
But that means I get to enjoy myself all weekend.

02:32:43.420 --> 02:32:52.420
An F.U. in advance to the grapevine before you get to L.A. because that load is, like, crap, and there'll probably be a forest fire or something stupid.

02:32:52.420 --> 02:32:56.420
As there always is every time I go to L.A.

02:32:56.420 --> 02:33:02.420
And then an F.U. to, uh, L.A. freeway system in general, because it sucks.

02:33:02.420 --> 02:33:08.420
And the, uh, floating, uh, pockets of yellow smog that seem to be sentient.

02:33:08.420 --> 02:33:14.100
Um, and an F.U. goes to my nose for draining into my throat and I'm probably going to have

02:33:14.100 --> 02:33:19.100
a arthritis tomorrow. Just thought I'd let everyone know. All right, I'm done.

02:33:19.100 --> 02:33:28.100
All right, Loki. Anyways, um, first fuck you to McDonald's for not being able to fill an

02:33:28.100 --> 02:33:33.180
order correctly. I asked them for a two cheeseburger meal. Granted, I know that's not on their

02:33:33.180 --> 02:33:38.220
menu still, but it's still something that they offer because I get it almost every day.

02:33:38.220 --> 02:33:40.720
police every day this week uh...

02:33:40.720 --> 02:33:42.680
at the mcdonald's it's by my house

02:33:42.680 --> 02:33:45.500
at patty mc patty and instead

02:33:45.500 --> 02:33:49.300
they gave me this to make chicken

02:33:49.300 --> 02:33:52.940
meal thing or to make chicken sandwiches and like

02:33:52.940 --> 02:33:55.220
a medium frying stuff i'm like

02:33:55.220 --> 02:33:58.200
uh... knows about order all we thought

02:33:58.200 --> 02:34:01.780
we don't have a teacher remind me what it is to put in the ticketing

02:34:01.780 --> 02:34:06.100
scenic chicken on the phone and you should take them here

02:34:06.100 --> 02:34:11.100
that the retarded no as i went back and i want my absolute

02:34:11.100 --> 02:34:14.140
yes

02:34:14.140 --> 02:34:17.900
but he's a stupid people they're driving out there to his

02:34:17.900 --> 02:34:20.180
i swear to god you know on the road today

02:34:20.180 --> 02:34:23.860
and i see this dumb bitch you know what she's kind of swerving in a lane

02:34:23.860 --> 02:34:29.340
because she's doing her fucking makeup and talking on the cell phone while driving on the freeway

02:34:29.340 --> 02:34:34.980
dumb bitch you know what that takes talent to do your makeup and talk on the cell phone AND drive

02:34:34.980 --> 02:34:36.620
that's amazing

02:34:36.620 --> 02:34:40.420
she's not going to come

02:34:40.420 --> 02:34:45.820
uh... alone in the hall of fame but you thought you could not being gory enough

02:34:45.820 --> 02:34:48.040
is a very you know he's disappointed

02:34:48.040 --> 02:34:51.940
fuck request for making movies and forget it

02:34:51.940 --> 02:34:54.800
ran blackboard i don't want to get away

02:34:54.800 --> 02:34:58.140
i didn't feel that i read all about it and it

02:34:58.140 --> 02:34:59.820
and it goes

02:34:59.820 --> 02:35:02.100
anyway i don't think that it grows

02:35:02.100 --> 02:35:05.340
it wasn't gross

02:35:05.340 --> 02:35:07.300
it didn't show anything

02:35:07.300 --> 02:35:09.540
whatever

02:35:09.540 --> 02:35:11.540
and uh...

02:35:11.540 --> 02:35:15.460
so fuck that and then uh...

02:35:15.460 --> 02:35:17.060
you know fucking microsoft

02:35:17.060 --> 02:35:18.860
for potentially

02:35:18.860 --> 02:35:21.580
not allowing me to have a three sixty m on today

02:35:21.580 --> 02:35:25.100
you know i pre-ordered mine way in advance and i have purchased games as

02:35:25.100 --> 02:35:26.140

uh... that will be coming soon so you know what i will damn well i'd better

02:35:29.980 --> 02:35:45.180
get my system or head to roll. So that's it. Heads will roll. All right, my FU time. Whoops,

02:35:45.180 --> 02:35:52.900
sorry I'm supposed to make it loud. Not that song, my song. There we go. I don't want no

02:35:52.900 --> 02:35:58.640
short dig man. All right, my FU's the week. FU did the fact that I feel like I'm getting

02:35:58.640 --> 02:36:02.360
Being sick progressively throughout tonight's show I felt my nose get more and more stuffy

02:36:02.360 --> 02:36:05.680
and a sore throat which is not good when you're supposed to be talking for eight hours a day

02:36:05.680 --> 02:36:06.680
in front of people.

02:36:06.680 --> 02:36:07.680
Uh oh.

02:36:07.680 --> 02:36:09.160
I'm going to be fucked come next week.

02:36:09.160 --> 02:36:13.200
It's a good thing I'm not in class tomorrow otherwise I would cry when I get tomorrow

02:36:13.200 --> 02:36:14.200
off.

02:36:14.200 --> 02:36:20.000
I'm making a stop by somewhere and getting coldies because coldies, the zinc brigade

02:36:20.000 --> 02:36:21.000
begins now.

02:36:21.000 --> 02:36:27.680
Do not do more than a hundred milligrams in a day or you can get zinc poisoning.

02:36:27.680 --> 02:36:33.480
I know, I just, I'll keep it, well that's gotta be like 10 of those drops though to get 100 grams, or 100 milligrams.

02:36:33.480 --> 02:36:41.480
Anyway, um, an F you to World of Warcraft for being all laggy, so I have to go buy more RAM, so either I'm getting an Xbox 360 or I'm getting more RAM.

02:36:41.480 --> 02:36:44.180
The World of Warcraft is very pretty, I have to give it that.

02:36:44.180 --> 02:36:45.480
I can be, or wasn't that pretty?

02:36:45.480 --> 02:36:46.880
More RAM.

02:36:46.880 --> 02:36:48.780
Get more RAM.

02:36:48.780 --> 02:36:50.480
For World, yeah, for my World of Warcraft.

02:36:50.480 --> 02:36:54.380
Instead of my, you're actually supporting my World of Warcraft addiction?

02:36:54.380 --> 02:36:58.780
I guess, but RAM's good for everything, so, you know, it might benefit the show, too,

02:36:58.780 --> 02:37:02.460
because I'm having problems on the Rob Roberts show with the program I'm using,

02:37:02.460 --> 02:37:04.060
and I think it's because of a lack of RAM.

02:37:04.060 --> 02:37:05.260
Yeah, RAM's good.

02:37:05.260 --> 02:37:06.300
RAM is very good.

02:37:06.300 --> 02:37:07.180
Oh, I like RAM.

02:37:07.180 --> 02:37:08.460
Yeah, RAM's good.

02:37:10.780 --> 02:37:13.660
Uh, yeah, I guess that's enough for me.

02:37:13.660 --> 02:37:14.700
Actually, the flu shots.

02:37:15.500 --> 02:37:18.540
Because I missed them at my work, but not that I would get one anyway.

02:37:18.540 --> 02:37:20.940
They swear up and down that flu shots do not make you sick.

02:37:20.940 --> 02:37:22.860
I get sick every time I have a flu shot.

02:37:22.860 --> 02:37:23.980
I know, it's total bullshit.

02:37:23.980 --> 02:37:25.980
I always get sick whenever I get a flu shot.

02:37:25.980 --> 02:37:27.980
I don't care what the doctor says.

02:37:27.980 --> 02:37:32.980
That's time out for me. You know, I get some time off work with a legitimate excuse.

02:37:32.980 --> 02:37:33.980
I just...

02:37:33.980 --> 02:37:36.980
If I'm not at work, it's an epidemic.

02:37:36.980 --> 02:37:40.980
I mean, I don't mean to talk myself up, but damn. I have to be there.

02:37:40.980 --> 02:37:44.980
Anyway, let's move on to Angel's F-You of the Week, and...

02:37:47.980 --> 02:37:50.980
Uh, have you ever the guy that griefed me yesterday in there?

02:37:50.980 --> 02:37:57.660
because you're an asshole a I don't think I'm a lesbian thank you very much

02:37:57.660 --> 02:38:02.100
and I don't think anyone in this room thinks I am obviously because well I'm

02:38:02.100 --> 02:38:09.580
taken by the best man ever in my opinion that's just me because he loves me and

02:38:09.580 --> 02:38:12.820
it's all good yeah well now hypothetically you could be

02:38:12.820 --> 02:38:17.780
I'm just kidding. I don't I don't care. I can't fire you damn it

02:38:19.420 --> 02:38:26.820
Yeah, so um screw you because um no, I'm not and neither are my friends and

02:38:27.500 --> 02:38:32.940
Neither are the two other people that were there with me that are also serving on this board

02:38:32.940 --> 02:38:37.100
so you need to go find somebody something else to do rather and

02:38:37.100 --> 02:38:42.420
and, or get kicked out of the game, because I can get you to do that now, so bye!

02:38:42.420 --> 02:38:46.660
And, um, FU'd at having my computer break again, because that sucks.

02:38:46.660 --> 02:38:50.660
Eh, I have to go fix that tonight.

02:38:50.660 --> 02:38:54.460
Other than that, I think I'm done.

02:38:54.460 --> 02:38:57.860
Alright, let's go to the chat room, FUs, and see what

02:38:57.860 --> 02:39:03.940
angst we have going on in chat tonight. Nintendo Maniac 64 says FU to Sky for not

02:39:03.940 --> 02:39:07.020
mentioning the pop versus soda argument like you said you would.

02:39:07.020 --> 02:39:09.420
It's Soda, there is no argument.

02:39:09.420 --> 02:39:13.320
F you chat members for not commenting on my links I posted in chat.

02:39:13.320 --> 02:39:18.620
F you guys for not mentioning the revolution in the Dreamcast Xbox 360 PS3 discussion.

02:39:18.620 --> 02:39:20.520
Didn't Loki say it would be out?

02:39:20.520 --> 02:39:25.120
You know, we would talk about the revolution if Nintendo would throw us a frickin' bone and give us more to talk about.

02:39:25.120 --> 02:39:28.920
December 9th is when they're debuting some more info.

02:39:28.920 --> 02:39:33.520
They said they're never gonna show the games until they're actually playable.

02:39:33.520 --> 02:39:36.520
Well then on December 9th is when we'll talk more about the revolution.

02:39:36.520 --> 02:39:43.520
NintendoManiac64 says F you to myself for doing certain legal activities that involve games, emulators, and downloading.

02:39:43.520 --> 02:39:46.520
Oh, did I just type that out to Sky, hee hee?

02:39:46.520 --> 02:39:49.520
Actually, emulators are not legal anymore.

02:39:49.520 --> 02:39:57.520
There's a loophole that's basically stated that the emulators themselves are not legal.

02:39:57.520 --> 02:39:58.520
But the problems are.

02:39:58.520 --> 02:40:00.520
Possibly, yes.

02:40:00.520 --> 02:40:05.360
Raz says, F you to my health teacher for telling the cast and crew of the play that we aren't

02:40:05.360 --> 02:40:10.520
allowed to turn on the stage lights anymore for practice because they use too much electricity.

02:40:10.520 --> 02:40:13.880
Excuse me, that's stupid.

02:40:13.880 --> 02:40:18.200
Goggle says, F you to me for not calling in when I actually had something to say.

02:40:18.200 --> 02:40:21.480
And F you to the AI in Soulcalibur 3 for being hard.

02:40:21.480 --> 02:40:22.480
Seconded.

02:40:22.480 --> 02:40:23.480
Seconded.

02:40:23.480 --> 02:40:26.520
Dark Setsuya says, I continued F you to Squeenix.

02:40:26.520 --> 02:40:31.400
I was supposed to get my slime keychains and I haven't seen any sign of them.

02:40:31.400 --> 02:40:35.340
SSJ100Matt says, F you to my boss pulling in office space and making me come in Saturday

02:40:35.340 --> 02:40:37.620
and Sunday for senseless crap.

02:40:37.620 --> 02:40:43.760
F you to my 4 year old Nvidia video card dying, thus making me spend a whole $75 on a replacement.

02:40:43.760 --> 02:40:47.020
But just remember, Friday is Hawaiian Shirt Day.

02:40:47.020 --> 02:40:49.140
GS191...

02:40:49.140 --> 02:40:50.800
That's a joke.

02:40:50.800 --> 02:40:53.600
Get it? No. Have you seen Office Space?

02:40:53.600 --> 02:40:59.600
Actually, I also saw that movie with, uh, Yahoo Serious.

02:40:59.600 --> 02:41:01.600
No, no, not him. Carrot Top!

02:41:01.600 --> 02:41:02.600
Yeah.

02:41:02.600 --> 02:41:03.600
There's a movie with Carrot Top.

02:41:03.600 --> 02:41:04.600
I don't know.

02:41:04.600 --> 02:41:07.600
I don't watch any movies with Carrot Top in them.

02:41:07.600 --> 02:41:11.600
I caught it because I was, um, I had to watch it because it was an E3.

02:41:11.600 --> 02:41:13.600
Can I do a tangent real quick?

02:41:13.600 --> 02:41:14.600
Okay.

02:41:14.600 --> 02:41:18.600
Um, my coworker called and left a voicemail for my other coworker and it was very hilarious.

02:41:18.600 --> 02:41:19.600
I got to hear this too.

02:41:19.600 --> 02:41:24.120
too. He used the soundboard from Ebon's World to leave this Office Space message saying,

02:41:24.120 --> 02:41:29.120
yeah, we're going to need you to come in on Saturday. Did you get the memo? Really funny.

02:41:29.120 --> 02:41:31.880
Really funny. And so I'm going to call and leave him and Miss Cleo.

02:41:31.880 --> 02:41:39.880
Lual Wednesday, that was it. Yeah? Lual Wednesday. Lual Wednesday. More. GS191 says, F you to

02:41:39.920 --> 02:41:44.380
the Xbox 360 kiosk for crashing and giving me the black screen of death and F you to

02:41:44.380 --> 02:41:49.000
my online math class. Well, it's nice to know some things in Microsoft never change. Dark

02:41:49.000 --> 02:41:52.600
Zacknight says F you to a customer today at my job that went nuts today just because we

02:41:52.600 --> 02:41:58.000
wouldn't exchange her year old leaf blower for a new one because it broke down.

02:41:58.000 --> 02:42:02.960
Jazz says F you to the Xbox 360, I saw a demo of you at Best Buy and you lagged more than

02:42:02.960 --> 02:42:05.760
my computer that was on the verge of its HD exploding.

02:42:05.760 --> 02:42:09.520
Why must you keep making yourself look worse and worse?

02:42:09.520 --> 02:42:13.160
Legend of Zaku says F you to the asshole customers that I have to put up with in my tech help

02:42:13.160 --> 02:42:17.360
desk job here on campus, thinking that they know how we do shit so they bitch and moan

02:42:17.360 --> 02:42:20.360
when we tell them that we don't go to people's dorms to fix their PCs.

02:42:20.360 --> 02:42:24.360
In other words, they are too lazy to bring down their PC to our office for fixin'.

02:42:24.360 --> 02:42:27.360
F you to Hollywood in general for drowning us with shitty remake movies.

02:42:27.360 --> 02:42:32.360
You're unoriginal, so get out from your asses and give us some original shit.

02:42:32.360 --> 02:42:36.360
LegoGuitar says F you to anyone who sucks.

02:42:36.360 --> 02:42:39.360
I'm in too much of a good mood to think of anything specific.

02:42:39.360 --> 02:42:45.360
And lastly, Sakurina says F you to me because I still haven't unlocked everything on EX2 because I suck.

02:42:45.360 --> 02:42:50.280
And F you to Krista Berg for invading Quebec.

02:42:50.280 --> 02:42:51.280
One more.

02:42:51.280 --> 02:42:55.460
Ron Chan says F you to my, I think it's boss, not boos, F you to my boss who decided to

02:42:55.460 --> 02:42:58.360
show up at my house 30 minutes ago with my paycheck.

02:42:58.360 --> 02:43:02.800
At least you got money out of it.

02:43:02.800 --> 02:43:04.520
All right.

02:43:04.520 --> 02:43:11.280
Thank you for your angst, chat room, you angsty, angsty individuals.

02:43:11.280 --> 02:43:16.760
I want to mention Vote For Us, a five in your player window, on your Live 365 player window.

02:43:16.760 --> 02:43:22.160
Your votes saying that we are a good station really helps us in getting the word out about

02:43:22.160 --> 02:43:23.160
Orange Lounge.

02:43:23.160 --> 02:43:27.560
Also, be sure to visit podcastalley.com and podcast.yahoo.com and vote for our podcast

02:43:27.560 --> 02:43:31.000
there because the more votes we get, the cooler we are.

02:43:31.000 --> 02:43:35.760
There's actually a thread in our forums on orangeloungeradio.com that says how you can

02:43:35.760 --> 02:43:37.280
help promote.

02:43:37.280 --> 02:43:41.920
And so we appreciate all the help that you guys give us.

02:43:41.920 --> 02:43:45.320
One other thing I want to mention for you guys, oh, I missed, I'm sorry, there's one

02:43:45.320 --> 02:43:54.240
more, shit, there's one more F.U. here, I better get to the music here, MPQ says F.U.

02:43:54.240 --> 02:43:59.580
to Sony, so you know about those retarded DRM CDs, yeah it's not enough that they fuck

02:43:59.580 --> 02:44:04.000
up people's computers and not care about it, who knows what a rootkit is, the dumbest thing

02:44:04.000 --> 02:44:06.600
is that this has nothing to do with piracy at all.

02:44:06.600 --> 02:44:08.240
It's a pissing contest against Apple.

02:44:08.240 --> 02:44:10.760
Yes, nothing to do with stopping piracy at all.

02:44:10.760 --> 02:44:13.160
Sony's just pissed because the iPod's beating them.

02:44:13.160 --> 02:44:20.240
Fuck you Sony, you're being fucking idiots, and you've lost my business.

02:44:20.240 --> 02:44:21.240
Better late than never, right?

02:44:21.240 --> 02:44:22.240
All right.

02:44:22.240 --> 02:44:27.680
I want to bring up something that was on the orangelaunchradio.com website earlier this

02:44:27.680 --> 02:44:28.680
week.

02:44:28.680 --> 02:44:29.680
I think this is kind of interesting.

02:44:29.680 --> 02:44:33.440
Konami is launching a new campaign, I thought this was interesting.

02:44:33.440 --> 02:44:38.720
They've launched a brand new website, and it's called Music in Every Direction.

02:44:38.720 --> 02:44:44.200
And we're not really sure what the fuck this is supposed to be, but it is a promo device,

02:44:44.200 --> 02:44:51.800
absolutely, at least, for DDR Extreme 2, Karaoke Revolution Party, and DDR Ultramix 3.

02:44:51.800 --> 02:44:54.760
And you can check this out, it's musicineverydirection.com.

02:44:54.760 --> 02:44:59.880
And all that's there right now are little bitty pictures of all those games, and enter

02:44:59.880 --> 02:45:03.760
your information below to stay up-to-date on the latest Konami music games and receive

02:45:03.760 --> 02:45:10.280
notification when the official website opens. So I'm not sure, so I guess, oh, some people

02:45:10.280 --> 02:45:13.760
are saying they saw a commercial on TV, so is this like their marketing campaign, how

02:45:13.760 --> 02:45:17.460
they're going to market all these games? Loki, you know anything about this? You, you posted

02:45:17.460 --> 02:45:19.280
this to our website, so I thought maybe you'd know.

02:45:19.280 --> 02:45:22.280
I didn't post this to our website. I thought you did. Who did?

02:45:22.280 --> 02:45:24.320
That's what it is. Oh, damn it.

02:45:24.320 --> 02:45:28.600
Copied it on something else. Oh, well. So I guess it's, so it's on TV, I guess I don't

02:45:28.600 --> 02:45:32.040
watch enough TV because I haven't seen these commercials. I haven't seen any either. During

02:45:32.040 --> 02:45:37.160
Elimidate, I saw the Guitar Hero with Loki in Dark Soccer commercial, but I did not see

02:45:37.160 --> 02:45:43.760
the commercial. Yeah, anyway. Oh goody. I'm just waiting for that. I know they're going

02:45:43.760 --> 02:45:48.960
to... You know what I'm buying Guitar Hero with? Hmm? My Best Buy bucks from McDonald's.

02:45:48.960 --> 02:45:51.280
Hell yes!

02:45:51.280 --> 02:45:54.840
I have thirty one dollars of that stuff now.

02:45:54.840 --> 02:45:57.540
Plus fifteen dollars from the uh...

02:45:57.540 --> 02:45:58.840
the puppies.

02:45:58.840 --> 02:46:01.600
Because I bought all three of them and they gave me the food.

02:46:01.600 --> 02:46:04.320
Yeah, I only have to pay like three bucks for the whole thing.

02:46:04.320 --> 02:46:05.600
Not bad, not bad.

02:46:05.600 --> 02:46:09.400
Alright, now I'm curious, what the fuck is this website you're on? Because it's moving by itself.

02:46:09.400 --> 02:46:12.280
It's like, it's a ghost thing. It looks like

02:46:12.280 --> 02:46:14.800
fridge magnet poetry. What the fuck is this site you're on?

02:46:14.800 --> 02:46:18.380
well this is nothing this is just some retarded and have viral campaign and no

02:46:18.380 --> 02:46:21.740
one cares about for the three sixty that

02:46:21.740 --> 02:46:25.300
located i can tell that some of the best way it's like you were talking about

02:46:25.300 --> 02:46:28.240
you know when i look at these came out and stuff

02:46:28.240 --> 02:46:31.540
that was cool because while campaigning was

02:46:31.540 --> 02:46:36.280
kind of unseen in alternate reality gaming was kind of like brand new

02:46:36.280 --> 02:46:40.120
now everybody does it it's not cool anymore so

02:46:40.120 --> 02:46:49.640
Remember hex 168 came out, that 360 site? Well, hexadecimal of 168 is 360.

02:46:49.640 --> 02:46:55.000
This right here in binary is 360, and then there's this stupid thing that you go and

02:46:55.000 --> 02:47:00.520
type and stuff, and basically you can type in this, and there's little binary things,

02:47:00.520 --> 02:47:08.240
and there's a countdown, which, by the way, ends on the 15th, I want to say, at, I believe,

02:47:08.240 --> 02:47:10.840
seven p m pacific time

02:47:10.840 --> 02:47:13.080
uh... where the hell that's going to be great

02:47:13.080 --> 02:47:17.080
uh... so there's a safety type in playing that it teaches of the screen

02:47:17.080 --> 02:47:20.240
where there is the only thing and basically i don't like all my god you

02:47:20.240 --> 02:47:21.000
know it

02:47:21.000 --> 02:47:24.520
it's some you know probably have to figure out now i see just type of stuff

02:47:24.520 --> 02:47:27.600
in and other people type stuff in respond back to you and

02:47:27.600 --> 02:47:30.280
all of them and these can all move around that room

02:47:30.280 --> 02:47:33.480
it's sort of a chairman i think we're actually moving those yet people are

02:47:33.480 --> 02:47:36.560
moving it's like right now i'm gonna move a bunch of these at random

02:47:36.560 --> 02:47:41.460
and there's people off because people are trying to like you know type stuff in here

02:47:41.460 --> 02:47:47.140
and so i am moving them around to break up their sentences to piss them off

02:47:47.140 --> 02:47:48.620
doo doo doo doo doo

02:47:48.620 --> 02:47:50.300
and i'm gonna type poop

02:47:50.300 --> 02:47:55.220
and we're gonna see if that appears no actually see there's firefly

02:47:55.220 --> 02:47:56.740
someone just typed that earlier

02:47:56.740 --> 02:48:00.180
i was doing this the other day i kept typing orange lounge radio over and over

02:48:00.180 --> 02:48:02.420
and over again just for the fuck of it

02:48:02.420 --> 02:48:05.220
because it'll actually appear at one point

02:48:05.220 --> 02:48:07.960
because you know you take it in so many times

02:48:07.960 --> 02:48:09.540
but um...

02:48:09.540 --> 02:48:13.580
so we'll just see if we can get this up here. Have fun with it. What's the website for that again?

02:48:13.580 --> 02:48:20.460
uh... the website for this is www.101101000.com

02:48:20.460 --> 02:48:23.140
slash zero

02:48:23.140 --> 02:48:26.060
Yeah, good luck remembering that. Can you post that in chat please?

02:48:26.060 --> 02:48:30.340
Meanwhile, we're going to go back to the skype line because I promised some folks we'd go to the skype line

02:48:30.340 --> 02:48:31.580
a little later in the show

02:48:31.580 --> 02:48:33.880
and wouldn't you know we already have a call

02:48:33.880 --> 02:48:36.060
Hello, you're on Orange Long's video.

02:48:36.060 --> 02:48:38.000
Hey, what's up? It's Ron Luck.

02:48:38.000 --> 02:48:40.440
Hey, Ron Town, how are you?

02:48:40.440 --> 02:48:43.440
Hello! Hey, how are you everybody? How are you doing?

02:48:43.440 --> 02:48:45.240
What's on your mind?

02:48:45.240 --> 02:48:48.340
Not much. I just want to touch upon a couple of things.

02:48:48.340 --> 02:48:51.240
Xbox 360, if you're going to get one,

02:48:51.240 --> 02:48:55.900
I would suggest if you're on the Best Buy, I would get there about, oh, say,

02:48:55.900 --> 02:48:59.160
five, six a.m.

02:48:59.160 --> 02:49:01.160
That's crazy talk.

02:49:01.160 --> 02:49:09.160
I was there for the PSPs. I got there at 7am to take pictures. There were people there at 6am.

02:49:09.160 --> 02:49:13.160
Now, you also live in New York City, though, so...

02:49:13.160 --> 02:49:14.160
Alright.

02:49:14.160 --> 02:49:21.160
No, no, no, no. This is where I was living in the suburbs. I was in the city there. This was in the suburbs where my best friend opened up.

02:49:21.160 --> 02:49:27.160
And there were people there at 7. We opened the store early just to sell the PSPs.

02:49:27.160 --> 02:49:33.920
Okay, we're having kind of a hard time understanding you, Ron Chan, so you're kind of coming through

02:49:33.920 --> 02:49:34.920
really blurry.

02:49:34.920 --> 02:49:37.400
Also, Rob has suddenly developed an accent.

02:49:37.400 --> 02:49:38.400
I did?

02:49:38.400 --> 02:49:39.400
Yeah.

02:49:39.400 --> 02:49:40.400
Okay.

02:49:40.400 --> 02:49:41.400
What did I say?

02:49:41.400 --> 02:49:42.400
Understand.

02:49:42.400 --> 02:49:43.400
Whatever.

02:49:43.400 --> 02:49:44.400
Whatever.

02:49:44.400 --> 02:49:51.820
Okay, so Ron Chan, do you want to tell us really quick about some Nintendo event you

02:49:51.820 --> 02:49:52.820
went to?

02:49:52.820 --> 02:49:57.820
Yeah, I went to the Nintendo World DDR Ballroom Mix Contest.

02:49:58.820 --> 02:50:00.820
And what happened?

02:50:01.820 --> 02:50:08.820
People got screwed. They had everything developed in different colors, and the top 8 was the least possible result.

02:50:09.820 --> 02:50:17.820
But what happened was, they only did it for 2 rounds. After that, every body in the top 6 had to advance.

02:50:17.820 --> 02:50:21.820
Basically about 30-40 people got screwed out of tournament.

02:50:21.820 --> 02:50:25.780
Oh, that's a bummer, but I guess that's going to happen in probably one of the bigger cities

02:50:25.780 --> 02:50:26.780
or something.

02:50:26.780 --> 02:50:29.900
Anyway, Ron Chen, you're kind of breaking up, I am going to have to let you go, but

02:50:29.900 --> 02:50:33.140
we hope we can talk to you again soon a little later, okay?

02:50:33.140 --> 02:50:34.140
Take care.

02:50:34.140 --> 02:50:35.140
Bye.

02:50:35.140 --> 02:50:36.140
Later.

02:50:36.140 --> 02:50:40.140
Okay, well I think what he said there was about the DDR with Mario event at the official

02:50:40.140 --> 02:50:41.140
Nintendo store.

02:50:41.140 --> 02:50:46.200
It sounds like people got screwed out of it somehow after only a couple rounds.

02:50:46.200 --> 02:50:47.200
That's too bad.

02:50:47.200 --> 02:50:51.340
Loki, you were saying you got Orange Lounge to appear on the site, and it looks like everybody's

02:50:51.340 --> 02:50:53.340
moving to the corners now.

02:50:53.340 --> 02:50:56.340
Yeah, see, there's like 50 people on this right now.

02:50:56.340 --> 02:50:59.340
There's Orange Laundry here. I'm holding it, and I'm shaking it around.

02:50:59.340 --> 02:51:01.340
Uh-huh.

02:51:01.340 --> 02:51:03.340
That's great.

02:51:03.340 --> 02:51:09.340
So our listeners are all on there just shuffling shit into all the corners.

02:51:09.340 --> 02:51:15.340
Beautiful. God, I love our listeners. I so, so love them.

02:51:15.340 --> 02:51:18.340
Another call on Skype line. Hi, you're on Orange Laundry Radio.

02:51:18.340 --> 02:51:21.340
Obviously, I don't need any introduction.

02:51:21.340 --> 02:51:25.340
Not at this point, Mr. Zaku. What's on your mind?

02:51:25.340 --> 02:51:28.340
Uh, just a comment on the little DDR Mario mix thing.

02:51:28.340 --> 02:51:33.340
The reason why people were getting screwed over is because, you know, it's Nintendo World's fault.

02:51:33.340 --> 02:51:38.340
You know, I squarely put the blame on Nintendo World for the fact that they didn't go to DDR Freak

02:51:38.340 --> 02:51:41.340
or any of those sites to advertise a tournament.

02:51:41.340 --> 02:51:46.340
Because if they did that, people, you know, most of us players would have, like,

02:51:46.340 --> 02:51:50.420
like you know straighten out the rules to the point where it would be fair for everyone

02:51:50.420 --> 02:51:53.700
and that's what happens you don't get the you don't get the people that have the experience

02:51:53.700 --> 02:51:59.060
and is involved and thus you know you're misinformed and shit like this happens

02:52:00.500 --> 02:52:07.460
so so they suck yeah but you know the yeah the whole yeah ddr mario mix pretty much you know

02:52:07.460 --> 02:52:12.020
that whole tournament thing you know is a joke okay well ddr mario mix is a joke anyway too

02:52:12.020 --> 02:52:17.020
So what I'm curious about is Saku. Saku, what's the latest on MTV?

02:52:17.020 --> 02:52:19.020
Because you're going to be rich and famous, right?

02:52:19.020 --> 02:52:24.020
Yeah, I got the email. They sent me an email last Thursday. I've already replied to them.

02:52:24.020 --> 02:52:28.020
They're going to be filming next Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday.

02:52:28.020 --> 02:52:33.020
Hopefully I should be able to make it next Wednesday if I get more information from them.

02:52:33.020 --> 02:52:40.020
And then a week after that, during MTV's Gaming Week, aka the Xbox 360 launch week, they will air it.

02:52:40.020 --> 02:52:44.900
Alright, now, if you can somehow get Orange Lounge in there, whether it be like a picture

02:52:44.900 --> 02:52:48.980
in the background, or, you know, you're name dropping it, or somehow Orange Lounge gets

02:52:48.980 --> 02:52:49.980
in there, I will...

02:52:49.980 --> 02:52:51.980
Dude, if you send me an OLR shirt, I will wear it.

02:52:51.980 --> 02:52:52.980
I will mail you...

02:52:52.980 --> 02:52:53.980
Seriously.

02:52:53.980 --> 02:52:54.980
You will get one of the...

02:52:54.980 --> 02:52:58.420
If you will make me an extra large shirt that says, in black, that says Orange Lounge radio

02:52:58.420 --> 02:53:01.660
on it, I would definitely wear, I would definitely wear that shirt out.

02:53:01.660 --> 02:53:02.660
Damn it.

02:53:02.660 --> 02:53:09.940
Maybe, I don't know if we can get it done in time, but I will, I'll send you a dollar.

02:53:09.940 --> 02:53:17.240
Also, 1UP.com is saying that BeatMania is being pushed up early to the 15th of February

02:53:17.240 --> 02:53:20.140
of next year.

02:53:20.140 --> 02:53:24.660
I do not know of any changes inside Konami as far as I know.

02:53:24.660 --> 02:53:28.100
Well, I know what 1UP.com is saying, but I don't mean I agree with it.

02:53:28.100 --> 02:53:29.100
We'll see.

02:53:29.100 --> 02:53:30.100
We'll see.

02:53:30.100 --> 02:53:31.100
Maybe.

02:53:31.100 --> 02:53:35.740
I could see it getting bumped up, but as far as I know, it's not done yet, so we'll see.

02:53:35.740 --> 02:53:36.740
Alright.

02:53:36.740 --> 02:53:39.300
Well, Zachary, we're gonna let you go.

02:53:39.300 --> 02:53:48.300
Just do whatever. Just see if you could try to send me a shirt or something. I seriously would allow you to use me as a billboard or some sort of advertising.

02:53:48.300 --> 02:53:51.300
We want to do the shirt thing so bad, but it's just a costume.

02:53:51.300 --> 02:53:54.300
Or something like that, but just...

02:53:54.300 --> 02:53:57.300
Alright. Alright, Zach, we're going to let you go, okay? Have a good one.

02:53:57.300 --> 02:53:59.300
You know, just think about it, man.

02:53:59.300 --> 02:54:02.300
I know. We'll get it. Alright, take care.

02:54:02.300 --> 02:54:03.300
Rob, later.

02:54:03.300 --> 02:54:05.300
Alright, just so you know...

02:54:05.300 --> 02:54:07.300
What's going on now on the site? We've got like tons of people on the site.

02:54:07.300 --> 02:54:20.540
Yeah, it's really funny. The name of the page, the title, it is 101101000 slash zero, and

02:54:20.540 --> 02:54:22.420
then colon, it's so much fun.

02:54:22.420 --> 02:54:27.740
What? Somebody actually put it so much fun on there?

02:54:27.740 --> 02:54:35.060
No, I think it just, I don't know how it appeared on there, but it just says it's so much fun.

02:54:35.060 --> 02:54:37.060
That's great.

02:54:37.060 --> 02:54:41.640
So I gotta watch this. What is going on here? So everybody's on the site just like shuffling around.

02:54:41.640 --> 02:54:51.960
Zombie butt, I love Ross, goat, goat say love, orange love Japan, so...

02:54:51.960 --> 02:54:53.320
No, you don't, you fucker, like, look.

02:54:53.320 --> 02:54:55.760
That's great. Jamie's fighting with somebody.

02:54:55.760 --> 02:54:58.960
The Burger King's touching orange round, stop!

02:54:58.960 --> 02:55:01.760
I'm trying to get me on there, but it's not working.

02:55:01.760 --> 02:55:03.960
You guys are crazy. You need bleached asshole on there.

02:55:03.960 --> 02:55:05.560
Oh, there I am. There's, there's...

02:55:05.560 --> 02:55:07.560
Somebody already clicked and dragged you away.

02:55:07.560 --> 02:55:09.560
I'm putting me in the corner.

02:55:09.560 --> 02:55:11.560
That's me in the corner.

02:55:11.560 --> 02:55:12.560
We'll get Sky in there now.

02:55:12.560 --> 02:55:13.560
Alright, great.

02:55:13.560 --> 02:55:15.560
You kids have fun with that, but not too much.

02:55:15.560 --> 02:55:17.560
Let's try to take one more call, at least one more.

02:55:17.560 --> 02:55:19.560
This is going to be another phone once, I don't know if this will work, we'll see.

02:55:19.560 --> 02:55:21.560
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

02:55:21.560 --> 02:55:23.560
Hey, it's Jazz.

02:55:23.560 --> 02:55:25.560
Hey, Jazz, what's on your mind, my friend?

02:55:25.560 --> 02:55:27.560
Uh, not much.

02:55:27.560 --> 02:55:31.560
I was just, uh, I have some thoughts about the Xbox 360 and everything.

02:55:31.560 --> 02:55:34.560
Please, tell us your thoughts on the Xbox 360.

02:55:34.560 --> 02:55:40.560
I saw it at Best Buy, and it looked like crap.

02:55:40.560 --> 02:55:42.560
And what?

02:55:42.560 --> 02:55:43.560
It looked like crap.

02:55:43.560 --> 02:55:45.560
What was wrong with it?

02:55:45.560 --> 02:55:53.560
It was really laggy. They were playing King Kong, and everything was running at 15 FPS at that.

02:55:53.560 --> 02:55:56.560
It looked like me playing Final Fantasy XI in lower Juno.

02:55:56.560 --> 02:56:03.560
Yeah, basically. It was really bad. I was like, damn, this is what everybody worked it up about.

02:56:03.560 --> 02:56:06.560
So needless to say, you're not going to be buying an Xbox 360?

02:56:06.560 --> 02:56:08.560
Not at the moment, no.

02:56:08.560 --> 02:56:12.560
Nuh-uh. I'm going to stick with my ghetto, broken-down Xbox for now.

02:56:12.560 --> 02:56:14.560
I know what he's going to do instead.

02:56:14.560 --> 02:56:15.560
What?

02:56:15.560 --> 02:56:16.560
What?

02:56:16.560 --> 02:56:22.560
Uh, what did you just buy last week? Hint. Nudge. Elbow.

02:56:22.560 --> 02:56:24.560
Uh, R-Hero?

02:56:24.560 --> 02:56:26.560
No! You bought one month of what?

02:56:26.560 --> 02:56:28.560
Oh no!

02:56:28.560 --> 02:56:31.560
Light goes on. He won the Warcraft.

02:56:31.560 --> 02:56:33.560
I know, I got sucked in for another month.

02:56:33.560 --> 02:56:35.560
Congratulations on that, by the way.

02:56:35.560 --> 02:56:36.560
I know.

02:56:36.560 --> 02:56:39.560
Man, I wasn't even there for five minutes last week.

02:56:39.560 --> 02:56:40.560
What show are you on?

02:56:40.560 --> 02:56:41.560
Uh...

02:56:41.560 --> 02:56:44.560
Yeah, I'm not telling it on air, but yeah.

02:56:44.560 --> 02:56:48.560
Alright.

02:56:48.560 --> 02:56:53.560
So, speaking of Guitar Hero, we gotta finish the show here pretty quick,

02:56:53.560 --> 02:56:55.560
but really quickly, your thoughts on Guitar Hero?

02:56:55.560 --> 02:56:56.560
I think it's great.

02:56:56.560 --> 02:57:00.560
I think it's leaps and bounds better than Guitar Freaks ever was.

02:57:00.560 --> 02:57:06.780
Just because of the fact that it's not all pictured J-Pop, and I think that feels a lot

02:57:06.780 --> 02:57:07.780
more to people.

02:57:07.780 --> 02:57:11.780
Besides that, yeah, it's a great game.

02:57:11.780 --> 02:57:13.900
Yeah, it's definitely different than Guitar Freak.

02:57:13.900 --> 02:57:16.340
Certainly a different song list that's going to appeal to a whole different audience.

02:57:16.340 --> 02:57:19.060
Alright, well, Jazz, we've got to go because we've got to wrap up the show, but thanks

02:57:19.060 --> 02:57:21.060
so much for calling in, okay?

02:57:21.060 --> 02:57:22.060
Alright, bye.

02:57:22.060 --> 02:57:23.060
Alright, later.

02:57:23.060 --> 02:57:24.060
Bye!

02:57:24.060 --> 02:57:26.060
Alright, that's going to do it for our Skype calls tonight.

02:57:26.060 --> 02:57:30.660
Okay, now's the part of the show where we're going to go around and get everybody's final

02:57:30.660 --> 02:57:34.300
thoughts, because it's that time of the show where we're almost done.

02:57:34.300 --> 02:57:36.660
So we're going to start it off by going over to Angel.

02:57:36.660 --> 02:57:44.100
Angel, what is your final thought of the evening?

02:57:44.100 --> 02:57:46.940
Must buy Guitar Hero.

02:57:46.940 --> 02:57:52.140
