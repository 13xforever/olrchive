369	2431	Orange Lounge Radio To Go Edition, week of November 28th, 2005.
2551	13418	You're tuned in to the Orange Lounge Radio To Go Edition, your podcast home for all the latest video game news and gamer chat.
13658	17081	Now, here are your hosts, DarkSakura, Sky, and Loki.
19269	20729	Hello, everybody.
20869	24710	Welcome to another edition of Orange Lounge Radio To Go.
25450	29771	It's that podcast dedicated to all things gaming, all the news you want to hear about.
30271	33332	And of course, as we always say, we like to talk about video games that don't suck.
33752	38212	Although sometimes we have to talk about video games that do suck just to warn you to stay the hell away.
38933	39773	My name is Rob Roberts.
39793	40793	You might know me as Sky.
40913	43694	Joining us, welcome back, DarkSakura.
43774	44454	We missed you.
44754	45054	Hi.
45294	45774	How are you doing?
46494	47074	Voiceless.
47614	48074	I know.
48674	51775	Now what, you have the, what we've been calling the wheel.
51795	52275	The plague.
52955	56136	Not the plague, the wheel of infection or whatever.
56296	58957	Because your doctor's telling you every week it's something different or something, right?
59017	62877	It was a cold that turned into a sinus infection while I was in L.A.
63237	64718	because I came back really sick.
64838	65058	Right.
65498	73100	And then he told me it was bronchitis but a chance that it was pneumonia and he put on my thing pneumonia and I had an x-ray and all that.
73540	75180	And this week he's telling me it's whooping cough.
75800	98056	or it might be he's taking the cultures he stuck a q-tip up my nose ew it was gross it tickled i wanted to sneeze well well you're back and i know you're not feeling it 100 but we appreciate you being here and our listeners have said they've missed you so as i'm sure you've seen in the mailbag so is their aim improving they're trying some people out there haven't missed you but they don't know they don't know crap yeah but they suck screw them
98928	100069	Loki's here, as always.
100089	100749	Say hello to Loki.
101070	101390	I'm here.
101570	102591	No whooping cough for Loki.
102851	103111	No.
103532	104092	No whooping cough.
104412	105733	I can arrange for you to get the plague.
106574	107214	How you doing, Loki?
107935	108856	I'm doing good.
109516	109756	Yes?
110137	110417	Yes.
111057	116221	I could be doing better, had I had a 360, but I'm still doing good.
116441	117642	Crazy stuff with the 360 launch, huh?
119878	120819	Nothing I didn't expect.
134850	136552	DarkSakura, have you been able to fit in any time for gaming?
136572	139335	I know you've been sick, but what have you been playing, if anything?
139355	140876	I played some Katamari last night
156045	156945	New one or the old one?
156985	161447	The new one, but I got motion sick because my stomach was already feeling irritated.
163367	176631	I turned on World of Warcraft and then shut it back down again because I couldn't stand... It's just like, because I've been so disoriented, it's been driving me crazy to play anything, so I've been taking it kind of easy with gaming.
177152	181333	However, I did play some PSO Blue Burst while I was in L.A.,
182734	185956	and did watch somebody play through a couple of quests on the Xbox.
187538	189879	And didn't you get a chance to check out Xbox 360?
190720	191380	Yes, actually.
191981	209113	I didn't play it because I just wasn't feeling well enough but I got to see Perfect Dark Zero which I thought was pretty cool and then Call of Duty and then Project Gotham Racing and Dan's been playing a whole lot of Need for Speed Underground so I've actually seen quite a bit of that.
210117	218039	and he compared it between Xbox and Xbox 360 and said that the 360 version really just seems like a port.
218359	221039	It's slower, not as much fun as the Xbox version.
221900	222600	Interesting.
223920	227841	And I got to see the BSOD on the Xbox 360.
227961	230381	Not the blue screen of death, but... The black screen of death!
230502	230762	All right.
233530	235091	What caused the black screen?
235111	235831	That's my ask.
235851	240754	I think it just got hot, but it was on the same game that I'm hearing most of the complaints about.
240774	245657	It was on... Call of Duty 2?
245817	245997	No.
246797	248098	On Project Gotham 3.
248138	250679	I was going to say, it's one of the racing games, if I remember right.
250839	257863	Yeah, in fact, one of our listeners had actually sent us an article about that, but I was going to say from experience, I've seen it happen.
258303	261465	And it was on that game, and most of the people I talked to said that it is on...
263379	268025	I want to say GTA, but it's Project Gotham.
268105	270788	And aren't they saying that it's all related to the power supply, basically?
272190	273672	I know that it's overheating.
273712	278337	I don't know exactly why, but most of the people who run into the problems are playing with their game in a cabinet.
278958	280160	I know that's a common factor.
280180	282022	Hmm.
284966	286367	Anything else you wanted to share with us, DarkSakura?
287548	288548	Not particularly.
289409	292551	Unless you want to hear the details of my illness, I doubt that.
292571	293432	Maybe on another show.
293672	294072	Loki.
295833	302478	Well, I took a little time off this week because of my car and being broken.
303559	309343	Meanwhile, while that was being worked out, I've been playing Mario Kart DS, and that's really fun.
310203	311444	I do not like snaking.
311892	313153	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
335726	336287	That I have to say.
336327	338208	But other than that, I'm playing people that don't snake.
338308	340130	It's still really fun, because the games get really close.
340150	345875	We played a match earlier today, and man, down one race, man, down the line, it was just crazy.
345895	348477	Yeah, me, you, and Miklatov were all playing a match in the house, right?
348638	349598	Yes, and that was fun.
349678	350039	Good times.
350459	358626	So I really wish there'd be more people on my friends list popping on during the day, but a lot of times, even doing worldwide, it's hard to get four players, which is really strange.
358867	361569	I don't know why I'm right in that problem, but I don't know.
362230	362310	Um...
363420	365221	Grand Theft Auto Multiplayer Shadow of Colossus
391437	395779	I don't think it's as big, huge, impressive game that everyone was saying.
396099	398921	It looks pretty, yeah, but that's about it.
398941	400382	There's really no content to the game.
415490	417874	It just looked a little boring.
417894	419758	I'm not sure I like the concept itself.
419818	421160	It looked a little... It is boring.
421180	422402	There's no story to it, really.
422422	426490	Maybe it's just my perspective and what I look for in a game, but it didn't look like my kind of thing.
427997	431378	I don't like the fact that there's no other enemies, no nothing.
431838	432959	There's no real puzzle.
433039	438400	I mean, the only puzzle solving in the game is figuring out how to get on these Colossus and figuring out how to kill them.
438641	440161	But once you're done with that, you're done.
440221	442022	And there's only 16 of them in the game.
442322	449004	Granted, there is a hard mode, but when you go through the hard mode and the time modes or whatever, you can actually unlock more weapons to make it easier.
449927	451528	Why do you want the game to be easier?
451628	452368	It's going to be shorter.
452408	458832	Doesn't it have some point where you can actually kill lizards and shoot fruit with a bow and arrow and stuff?
460362	461243	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
490951	492593	I just want to get done with it so I can sell it back
509235	513877	Some games that I've been playing this week, I checked out the Final Fantasy XII demo and I gotta say I'm pretty impressed.
514718	525183	They did change some stuff from what I saw at E3 two years ago in regards to the battle system because it looks like now with the battle system that there's not the boxes around the screen or anything.
525223	538589	It is very seamless where you are walking around and it's unlike other Final Fantasy games in the past, except for XI of course, where you, but I know a lot of people didn't play that, where you walk up to something and engage it like in real time and it's very different from Final Fantasy's of the past.
538889	553978	But I think what's very interesting about the battle system, which is pretty much all that this demo really allows you to see is the battle system, is that you basically, it kind of fuses XI with the old battle systems, which I think is very interesting because there's a lot about XI I really did like.
554558	560822	And the thing is that your party members, if you want them to, will do their own things.
561002	563884	And it's almost like you're playing online but with intelligent people.
568086	576792	I was a little disappointed with the summon sequences, even though they're grand and overdone like they are in every Final Fantasy game.
576812	579373	I don't know, I was expecting something a little bit different.
579413	581174	A little bit of load time problems there, but nothing...
582515	584696	I can see the pixelation really bad on my TV.
584716	584976	I'm sorry.
606464	608185	I'm having microphone problems tonight, sorry guys.
609665	615347	It would look very pixelated on my TV, and if that's the way that the game actually looks when it comes out, I'm going to be sorely disappointed.
616407	618068	I'm sure this is just because it's a demo.
618168	633032	I'm very sure it's just the demo, and the movies will look fantastic, but I couldn't help but kind of sense a little bit of disappointment because I wanted to see in the demo a little bit that, you know, nice looking game, you know, the rendering sequences and everything, so...
634152	638956	Also, obviously, if I got the Final Fantasy XII demo, I must be playing Dragon Quest VIII, which is true.
638997	640378	I picked up a copy of Dragon Quest VIII.
640678	643761	There's a lot of stuff I really like about Dragon Quest VIII.
644341	651267	I'm gonna be honest with you guys, I haven't really been into a Dragon Warrior or Dragon Quest game since the very, very first game on the NES.
651647	652027	I've kind of...
652768	654349	Just slept through the rest of the series.
654389	656090	I never played the one that was out on PlayStation.
656390	658852	I didn't bother to play... Well, of course, a lot of them didn't even come out here.
659152	660953	I didn't bother to play any of the other ones on the NES.
661213	662794	So I kind of napped through a lot of Dragon Quest.
662834	665416	But I'm, for some reason, finding myself really liking this one.
665996	677123	It's definitely an old-style RPG, which is good and, you know, maybe not good for some people, but good for me because it's definitely a throwback to, like, the older games where it's like, you know, the enemies are there, attack, magic.
677143	677864	It's very basic.
677884	679385	They don't try to overdo it with all these...
680529	684894	They don't try to overdo it with all these crazy concepts or anything during the battles.
684934	685795	So I like it.
685855	686456	It's a good game.
687077	689199	A lot of good graphics, too.
689239	696188	It's got a very different graphical style to it, obviously, because some of the graphics were done by a famous anime guy and
697590	701155	The only disappointment I would say that I have with the game is the cut sequences.
701495	707223	There's some cut sequences in there that have a lot of load time, and the voice acting is very slow.
707563	712330	And I find myself wanting to push the X button before the cut sequence finishes, usually.
713371	717653	Just to get through the cut sequences there, I usually want to push the X button just to get through them.
718794	720775	I apologize again, you guys, but I have a crazy mic tonight.
720815	722595	I might have to pass back and forth with somebody else here.
722615	727918	For the record, it's Toriyama, who did Dragon Ball Z. Thank you, I couldn't remember that name.
727938	730659	I knew he did Dragon Ball Z. Dr. Slump and Classic.
730679	732540	That's the only thing that turns me off about that game.
732580	734301	I don't like Dragon Ball Z at all.
734881	738983	But, you know, a lot of the character animations are very funny, like a lot of the animals.
739023	745305	The monsters are very similar to what you saw in the old Dragon Warrior games, you know, the slimes and everything.
745586	749747	But they do some funny things, like they'll make your characters dance, and the dancing motions are hilarious.
749827	750228	I love it.
750328	750728	It's great.
750808	753029	So, yeah, I definitely...
753749	762311	I recommend Dragon Quest VIII if you're a fan of roleplaying games, especially if you're looking for a throwback to a very old, less complicated RPG type game.
762751	763692	A lot of work, though.
763932	767132	It's not something you can just play through very quickly and watch the cutscenes.
767432	770313	You will die if you don't take some time to stop and gain experience.
770333	771914	And that bugs some people, so I don't know.
772154	781356	Granted, though, if you are still looking for a throwback to really old games and stuff, especially old RPGs, Wild Arms Alter Code F, which came out a couple weeks ago,
781812	791474	and Romancing Saga, which came out a couple months ago, which was the original Saga Frontier, so both remakes of their original counterparts should be pretty good, too.
792635	795715	And, oh, and, and, and, in a couple weeks, Final Fantasy IV.
797396	799016	What's the street date on that, do we know?
799696	806258	Second week in, or no, wait, yeah, second week, second real week in December, so around the week of the 12th, I think.
807738	808999	I'm definitely looking forward to that.
809219	810139	You spoony bard.
812866	814747	I think we'll start off getting into the news tonight.
814807	824111	However, I want to issue a couple of corrections to things we've talked about on previous podcasts because, you know, we're human, we're gaming fans, and we sometimes make mistakes.
824752	827853	This first one isn't so much a mistake as it is a clarification.
827873	832715	A couple podcasts ago we were talking about Guild Wars, and I said that NCSoft makes Guild Wars.
833115	840640	And somebody over on our forums, a main fan over on the forums, wanted to clarify that ArenaNet actually made Guild Wars, and they deserve the credit.
841060	843102	NCSoft simply publishes the game.
843982	852468	Which is interesting because it kind of brings up this whole thing about, you know, usually it is the publishers that get the credit because they're the ones that are, you know, paying for the advertising and all that stuff that are, you know...
853068	853608	and so on.
875500	877381	I'm definitely willing to issue that clarification there.
878322	884706	But just be careful with what you read out there because sometimes the people who are publishing the game may not necessarily be making it.
884726	888828	A classic example would be Nintendo publishes a lot of stuff that they don't necessarily do.
889148	890209	Like the old Rare games.
891049	891449	Yeah.
892630	892870	Anyway.
894031	894571	Something to think about.
894591	903195	The other clarification we would like to make was related to something that we talked about previously last week and it had to do with the Chinese gamer and the parents were suing Blizzard.
903676	909879	He was not a World of Warcraft player because World of Warcraft wasn't really out in China until May of this year.
910279	919524	It was actually Warcraft 3 was the game that the Chinese gamer committed suicide after playing and the parents are still suing Blizzard because of it.
920025	928945	But of course, this just goes to show, because we get our news from other sources, obviously, because there's very few companies that send us releases directly.
930270	930830	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
951025	952086	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
972415	973955	It's just stupidity.
974435	976036	Taking the bad genes out of the gene pool.
976376	978936	Well, let's start off with our first story tonight.
978996	983157	And I said for tonight's first story I wanted to do anything besides an Xbox 360 story.
983217	985578	Just because I'm too oversaturated.
985758	988058	And believe me, we have plenty of Xbox 360 things to talk about.
988078	990499	But I said anything but an Xbox 360 story.
991479	993359	So we have something better.
993719	995000	We have a story about 50 Cent.
996140	996580	He's retarded.
998239	1001700	50 Cent actually has this game, 50 Cent Bulletproof, which came out recently.
1002181	1006583	And sexual themes, intense violence, use of drugs, blood and gore.
1006943	1008664	No surprise this game has an M rating, right?
1009344	1014667	Well, guess what Curtis Jackson, also known as 50 Cent, said in a recent interview with Reuters.
1015388	1019470	Just because it is rated mature doesn't mean you shouldn't buy it for your kids.
1020711	1021791	No, actually, that's what it means.
1021932	1023392	Hold on, hold on, though, now, wait a minute.
1023412	1025693	Because I think this is where most people stopped reading.
1026093	1030195	And here's what the rest of what 50 Cent has to say.
1030835	1035357	He said, play the game and explain to them what they are playing.
1036658	1040239	So he's saying that parents should play the game and then explain to the kids what they are playing.
1040619	1040780	So...
1041980	1044101	I think the intentions might be good here.
1044582	1049865	I know I wouldn't let my kid play this type of game because that's just too much violence and sex and all that stuff.
1050626	1060552	But I do like the fact, I think many people pass this off as 50 Cent is crazy, but I do like the fact that he is saying, parents, play the game with your child.
1060672	1062153	Parents, get involved.
1062753	1070658	Even though maybe he didn't say it the right way, I at least kind of give him a little bit of credit for trying to say that the parents should be involved, although maybe he wasn't.
1070779	1071139	I don't know.
1071599	1072779	But, what do you think?
1073139	1078700	I think what he's saying is, oh my god, my game was released one week after True Crime New York City.
1079100	1080461	It's not going to sell very well.
1080681	1082461	Kids, please buy my game because I need the money.
1084321	1086262	He's just not thinking.
1086582	1087762	That's all it is.
1088942	1092123	I thought he was like, you can use this as a teaching tool.
1092183	1095723	And you know, maybe this is too loud.
1095763	1098484	Maybe it could be a teaching tool of sorts.
1099344	1099584	But,
1100774	1106497	In the real world, kids are just gonna go, oh, 50 Cent said I should play this violent game, blah blah blah blah blah.
1109378	1109838	Whatever.
1112219	1117021	I wouldn't be surprised if they'd taken him completely out of context in this interview, because you know that stuff happens all the time.
1117081	1119922	Loki, you wouldn't know anything about being taken out of context in an interview.
1120223	1121123	Isn't it so much fun?
1125681	1125981	Alright.
1128284	1131106	I guess now we can talk a little bit about Xbox 360.
1132288	1133229	Let's talk about this.
1133909	1136112	I don't know if you knew this, but Microsoft is taking $126...
1138732	1141753	They're writing it off for every Xbox 360 system they sell.
1142214	1148457	And while this may sound shocking, it actually isn't that uncommon because the gaming companies really make their money back on the games.
1148917	1154260	So just so you know, if you wanted to know how much of a loss Microsoft's taking on these consoles, $126.
1154600	1156781	And that doesn't count when you throw in all these peripherals.
1156801	1158142	This is just the console itself.
1158602	1159502	So kind of interesting.
1160102	1164845	Microsoft also saying that they are aware of the shortages and they are pushing...
1166346	1171408	This is a quote from Peter Moore, the Corporate Vice President of Worldwide Marketing and Publishing.
1171428	1176630	He said, Our goal is to replenish inventory in the channel every week.
1176991	1180052	So lots of Xbox 360s are flowing in every single week.
1180352	1183193	It's not like we're shipping and then going dry for two or three weeks.
1183794	1185094	Loki, do you have anything to add to this mess?
1185414	1191978	Yeah, basically, he's quoted saying, and I just saw this earlier, because they basically...
1193592	1196694	They're not going to be short at all with what's coming out here.
1196954	1197715	I wish I had the article.
1197755	1199476	Oh, here we go.
1199936	1208201	Basically, Major Nelson, the guy who's behind a lot of this launch stuff, he was visiting his family here on the East Coast.
1208282	1212304	He took the opportunity over the past couple of days to stop at various retailers.
1218757	1224181	I double checked with the retail team and while I can't speak to each retail outlet's specific distribution strategy, I can tell you that we...
1243789	1245210	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
1272510	1276093	And you know these Xbox 360s have been reporting crashing in DarkSakura.
1276113	1277734	You saw one of these things crash.
1277994	1280736	You know, to be perfectly honest, we got the BSOD once.
1281277	1287201	And then after that, I actually just saw it freeze without anything.
1287562	1289183	Just completely froze in the middle of a race.
1293046	1296648	Now, apparently you can actually fix these crashing Xbox 360s.
1296688	1301772	This was something that was posted over on GameSpot forums, that you can actually fix it with string.
1302132	1311478	All you have to do, hang it from above the ground, because the problem is that in these cabinets and stuff, they're overheating, because there's no way for it to effectively cool down.
1311498	1314360	The power supply is overheating, and I might clear that up.
1314741	1319104	But the problem is, the power supply does have a fan, and like any console, you want to keep it...
1320322	1320622	DarkSakura.com
1350373	1353315	I actually had a lot of the same issue.
1353555	1356336	I remember when the Dreamcast was released saying that it was overheating.
1358417	1367502	Well, what we used to do was we actually had a box set out until we started using our PS2 as a Dreamcast stand and letting it air out.
1368018	1372400	because all you have to do is keep those vents free of any obstruction and it does just fine.
1372600	1373001	You know what?
1373021	1376883	Some third-party company is going to come out just like they did with the original PlayStation.
1376903	1380845	Remember the fan that straps to the side of it and blows air through it so it doesn't overheat it.
1382025	1385747	Maybe the same thing could set the power supply in something and it cools it off.
1385767	1387988	Or maybe you could not release a console that overheats.
1388429	1388869	How about that?
1389169	1389889	Yeah, that might be good.
1391210	1392951	I tell you, they're falling into the Dreamcast trap.
1393737	1395479	DarkSakura, you have something about the N-Gage, right?
1395499	1396419	This made me smile.
1404071	1406873	Nokia shifts focus from gaming.
1407373	1408714	And how long did this take them?
1410596	1421283	Nokia's VP of Corporate Strategy, I guess I'm pronouncing this right, Antti Vasara, has confirmed that there are no plans for future versions of the N-Gage.
1421743	1427907	They are turning their focus toward mobile TV and music with the introduction of handsets like the N91.
1429228	1431690	A smartphone that can hold up to 3,000 music tracks.
1432991	1440776	They're planning on placing a greater emphasis on mobile gaming in 2007, which by that time, screen sizes and quality will offer better games.
1441456	1446799	And also the other thing is they're going to be introducing, they don't want just one platform dedicated to gaming.
1446820	1451863	They're actually going to be incorporating to all their M60 phones, which will be coming out.
1451943	1456786	So that's another reason why that they shouldn't be supporting the N-Gage.
1457025	1462728	Well, the quote I have from him is, N-Gage is still being sold, but it was not success in the sense of developing a new category.
1462748	1466310	So, N-Gage, we bid thee farewell.
1470793	1471133	Wow.
1472694	1473834	Oh, darn, what a loss.
1474275	1480738	Sorry, I think we've been doing this for like 45 weeks now, and I haven't yet to use the soundboard for anything, so I had to do that.
1483830	1485032	I'm sorry, the N-Gage was crappy.
1485893	1487594	I tried to like this system so bad.
1487654	1488876	I tried to play it at E3.
1490037	1490878	You have an N-Gage?
1490918	1491999	We gave it away.
1493100	1493420	It's bad.
1493520	1495603	It was the first model taco phone.
1496964	1497224	All right.
1498505	1506614	Speaking of something that should be sent far, far away, something about Jack Thompson, and I don't like bringing this guy up every week, but you got something funny.
1507392	1519215	Yeah, actually one of our regular listeners, Rob with two B's, he's actually sent me several articles and one of them I thought was about time.
1519795	1523336	Jack Thompson's Alabama license was revoked.
1524176	1529917	He had been basically shipped out before, you know, while they reviewed it, but his license is actually gone.
1530358	1532178	He cannot practice law in the state of Alabama.
1533049	1537852	Which just goes to show you, boys and girls, do not fuck with the gaming community.
1538573	1539833	Just kidding, don't sue me.
1540354	1540794	Of course.
1543135	1559966	He fired back at Judge Moore by claiming that the judge had violated the Alabama canons of judicial ethics by his unfortunate, improper, and prejudicial acts in this case at the expense of three bereaved Alabama families.
1560066	1562048	Oh, let me guess, he's an activist judge.
1562068	1562128	Yes.
1563058	1563659	You know what?
1564059	1569865	I think it's because there's somebody with some common sense in my home state, excuse me, who thought that you were a big loser.
1570045	1570586	How about that?
1571467	1574150	Too bad he practices law mainly out of Florida.
1575571	1575852	Who cares?
1576672	1578134	Sorry to any of our listeners in Florida.
1579676	1580977	Moving on, Loki, what else?
1581017	1582098	Sorry, you have to put up with him.
1582599	1583600	Loki, what else do you have for us?
1583991	1591495	Well, other than overheating Xboxes, we're hearing reports of scratching discs in the Xboxes as well.
1592156	1594617	Some people are saying, don't play your Xbox vertical.
1594717	1596398	Some are saying, don't play it horizontal.
1597058	1598499	Some people are just saying, don't play it at all.
1598559	1602321	But basically, no matter what you do, your disc will get scratched.
1603757	1607439	Basically, the moral of the story is don't tip your Xbox over while you're playing it.
1607960	1613103	It goes to show you that they're really rushes the market if they haven't found out, oh, you have these detrimental things.
1613143	1614383	Hey, this is scratching disk.
1614683	1616685	Maybe that's not a good feature they put in there.
1618546	1619887	So that was kind of interesting.
1620387	1626370	The other one that I thought was kind of funny is they were talking about the Xbox 360 DVD player.
1626791	1627331	They're saying it's...
1627859	1629460	Not very good, actually.
1630401	1633042	Funny, neither was the Xbox's DVD player.
1633122	1634723	No progressive scan, excuse me?
1635023	1637185	It's not nearly as awful as the PS2.
1637225	1647271	They were testing it on Episode 3 and said it looked decent, but this person who was reviewing it, their Samsung progressive player blew it out of the water.
1648132	1650173	So it sounds like no progressive on this one either.
1651253	1652534	You've got to be kidding me.
1652614	1655236	No, I swear I read an article that said they had it.
1656693	1658774	I'm sure some listener is going to email us one way or the other.
1660235	1660676	You know what?
1660716	1664398	You shouldn't be using your video game system as a DVD player anyway.
1665519	1666340	Some of us are cheap.
1666760	1667300	You know what?
1667340	1674966	You can go to Sam's Club and pay $50 and get a DVD player that will do everything you need it to do.
1675606	1678789	And finally, with every video game system launch...
1679249	1682811	There's always going to be a campaign to put Linux on it.
1682851	1683411	That's right.
1684912	1695158	Free60, the Free60 project, is aiming to put Linux, such as Darwin, on the Xbox 360.
1695739	1700161	And they've gathered lots of useful, detailed information surrounding inner workings of the 360.
1700741	1705024	For example, apparently the Xbox 360 is secured down by the following.
1705064	1706885	A flash that's encrypted.
1707352	1707913	DarkSakura,
1723115	1723975	Voila, homebrew.
1726796	1738660	You know, although I've kind of made fun of the people that install Linux on systems in the past, honestly, I do get the point of this when it comes to the Xbox 360 because it does open the door to all this neat homebrew stuff.
1739140	1743341	It's when you try to install Linux on like a toaster and a Billy Bass that I kind of go, what?
1743481	1744201	Hey, it's been done.
1744461	1746302	Or a speak and spell, I know it's been done.
1746322	1747562	It's like, you know, come on.
1749363	1752364	What is the practical, I mean, what are you going to run on a Billy Bass?
1753931	1754573	DarkSakura, Harry Potter
1762591	1765112	Yes, because I actually just saw the movie this week.
1765172	1765752	I'm so happy.
1766352	1769012	I decided to see Rent instead, actually.
1769373	1770873	And I do want to see Harry Potter.
1770893	1774014	I'm thinking of that song from Team America.
1774254	1777454	I want the kids to be gone.
1777514	1779715	And I couldn't help but think about that the whole time I was watching.
1780815	1782415	I'm going to get hate mail over this, but I hated Rent.
1782435	1783116	I thought it was awful.
1783656	1785376	The whole time I was sitting there going, get a job!
1786116	1786656	Get a job!
1787317	1788297	I still want to see it.
1788477	1789237	Or get AIDS.
1789981	1793964	But it was supposed to be a retelling of La Boheme.
1796345	1797706	Yeah, but then they, never mind.
1798266	1800307	Okay, Harry Potter.
1800968	1801768	Harry Potter.
1803769	1811374	Electronic Arts released a one-level demo for the movie tie-in for Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, and it's available for download.
1814778	1816220	I'm not sure if it's on EA's site.
1816320	1818824	I know they have a link to it from Eurogamer.
1820667	1825676	So I would suggest go there, click on the article about the Harry Potter demo and give it a download because it's supposed to be pretty cool.
1827387	1832710	I saw it for like half a minute at E3, and I was like, that looks kind of neat.
1833010	1841075	I did play like Harry Potter DS for like two seconds, and I just knew that you, I did the little spell thing with the stylus, and I thought that was kind of funny.
1841455	1842376	So, I don't know.
1843176	1846798	I don't buy a lot of the movie tie-ins unless it's really good.
1847038	1848739	Like Street Fighter 2, the movie, the game.
1849120	1849540	Just kidding.
1849760	1850160	That sucked.
1850420	1851221	I have that in my meme.
1851561	1856344	You know, I think I have that somewhere in a box for Saturn.
1857273	1857713	I'm sorry.
1857733	1858234	It's awful.
1858834	1860476	I think we bought it because it was a dollar.
1862498	1867582	Let's go over to ye olde mailbag, and I'm sure we've got plenty of emails.
1868142	1869664	DarkSakura's got to catch us up tonight.
1870544	1874588	If you want to send us an email, 2go at orangeloungeradio.com is the place to send an email.
1874888	1878111	The lovely DarkSakura will read your email and make fun of your grammar.
1879112	1880093	Well, I'd do that anyway.
1880113	1882114	I'd do that for free.
1882214	1882695	What do we got?
1883780	1888383	Well, just a couple more articles sent to us by our friend Rob, who is not you.
1890344	1892366	One about the PS3 pricing.
1892426	1894247	I actually read through this article.
1894447	1896468	It's a bit long to cover for the podcast.
1897109	1898930	I briefly read the article.
1899650	1902712	It was on CNN Money, actually.
1902752	1903833	And I think they retracted
1904663	1905643	I think I heard about that.
1905663	1907124	They retracted that a little later.
1907184	1910685	So, don't believe anything you hear and tell like E3.
1910785	1923510	This is fairly recent, but they were talking about with the DVD formats, the different high definition formats being supported by Sony and Microsoft, bringing back sort of like the old Betamax VHS war.
1924851	1925331	Goody, goody.
1925471	1926911	Betamax was better, by the way.
1927492	1928112	Stupid VHS.
1930642	1933265	We actually did sort of have a conversation via email.
1933305	1937689	I'm thinking the price of the Xbox is definitely going to drop after the release of the PS3.
1938269	1938930	Oh, it has to.
1938990	1939851	It has to.
1940371	1942293	Yeah, it's only with... Microsoft's going to make any money on it.
1944875	1951902	Also, he sent a... Oh, crap, I lost the email.
1952162	1952902	I apologize.
1954204	1954764	I actually...
1956181	1957621	Sega Launches New Operations Arm
1979588	1989411	Sega is back in the amusement game operations business and they plan to grow that part of their empire by building on the purchase of GameWorks, which has now reemerged from bankruptcy protection.
1990331	1993231	I'm very glad to hear someone still gives a shit about the arcades.
1993432	1994592	Honestly, this is great news.
1994612	1996472	Well, Sega's always kicked ass in the arcades.
1996632	2002934	And to touch on the skee-ball thing, the only reason why that game sucks is because your phone doesn't spit out tickets.
2005591	2015296	There's a quote in here saying, The asset purchase of GameWorks, a premier location-based entertainment destination, provides a platform for Sega to lead the amusement and facilities market domestically.
2015636	2016977	They're actually focusing on the U.S.
2017037	2017337	market.
2018638	2018858	Huh.
2019618	2019938	Interesting.
2020159	2027402	Another quote in here, Blending Japanese culture with American creativity has resulted in some of the most compelling, innovative, and popular products in the world.
2027902	2030704	SEUI also has the added advantage of tapping...
2031204	2036008	Sega's manufacturing expertise, all to deliver consumers an unparalleled entertainment experience.
2037649	2038189	What else we got?
2039570	2046235	Also got more email from actually one of our fellow podcasters, Bobby Blackwolf.
2046896	2047576	Oh, that guy.
2047776	2048377	He's got a good show.
2049077	2053200	Just talking about... I have to find the email again.
2053220	2053681	Okay.
2055125	2056346	We don't do it for a couple weeks.
2056366	2058528	You get disorganized.
2058568	2065333	I think I mentioned it on their three-hour show about him listening to our podcast while playing on the Xbox 360.
2065373	2067975	I thought that was pretty cool.
2068235	2072218	You can get your iPod to work through the Xbox 360 while you're playing any game.
2072238	2075340	I thought that was pretty cool.
2076621	2080404	If a game has a crap soundtrack, you can listen to whatever you want to.
2083446	2083666	Awesome.
2084286	2087167	I was going to plug his website, but I suddenly lost the URL.
2087207	2091228	But I know it's in our web link section on our website, OrangeLawnsRadio.com.
2091308	2092889	So check it out.
2093049	2093969	It's cool.
2096690	2097370	Wait, I got it.
2097830	2098250	Here it is.
2098310	2101291	It's allgames.com slash podcast.
2101311	2101531	Thank you.
2101551	2102772	Allgames.com slash podcast.
2102872	2103812	How did you beat me to that?
2103832	2104792	Because I had the email open.
2104832	2105432	You suck.
2105472	2106793	Allgames.com slash podcast.
2107113	2107413	Check it out.
2109056	2110537	He talks about a lot of the same stuff we do.
2110698	2113941	Not that it's the same thing, it's just we have similar interests, so that makes him cool.
2114161	2120888	The very last one, I mentioned this before, RagnarVille, sort of a portal for all free servers for Ragnarok Online.
2122629	2126313	The information is all up on the guy's site.
2126853	2127714	Mark emailed me.
2128235	2131518	So you'd want to go to www.ragnoville.com, check it out.
2132560	2135684	Ragnarok 2 Ragnarok 2
2148058	2148718	The little trailer.
2148898	2152560	That will get me totally off World of Warcraft when Ragnarok 2 comes out.
2152700	2154321	I gotta say, Ragnarok 2 looked pretty hot.
2155182	2158883	Gravity doesn't... Maybe they can't do anything because they're overseas.
2158923	2159184	I don't know.
2159204	2160324	That's kind of interesting.
2160604	2166007	Well, the thing is that IRO was actually played out of California, actually.
2166247	2166767	Weird.
2166787	2171270	Because I decided to look up their Better Business Bureau stats for a while.
2171590	2173771	Oh, yeah, when all that crap was going down.
2175052	2176433	Maybe that's why everybody went underground.
2176453	2186502	I don't think that there's any, you know, upon further review, I don't think there's any major problem with listing the free servers out there, because it's technically not hosting the servers.
2187242	2187983	Okay, yeah.
2188423	2197211	No, and again, though, that could get some of those servers in trouble if they use that, if, you know, whoever the legal one's in charge, use that as their portal to find these people.
2198772	2199272	I understand.
2199292	2203574	The Ragnarok community is a very tight one and a very rabid one, and it's cool.
2203794	2207856	I think it's kind of neat, especially when people are trying to mod the game and do different things with it.
2208276	2209737	But just be careful, guys.
2209857	2212558	Just make sure you're in all your checks and balances legally.
2212598	2213719	We don't want to see you get busted.
2213979	2214399	Have fun.
2214559	2214940	Have fun.
2215040	2217561	Make sure your copy doesn't have that pyrite virus.
2217601	2219022	Send Gravity a dollar.
2219042	2219602	They did write it.
2219862	2220802	Send them a dollar, at least.
2222003	2222263	All right.
2223084	2223724	So that's it for email.
2224304	2225025	Yeah, that's a free mail.
2225045	2227527	To go at OrangeLoungeRadio.com if you want to send us some more.
2227567	2228587	We love getting email.
2230289	2237814	I wanted to mention real quickly about Suikoden V. They're going to get a special edition Suikoden V in Japan.
2237834	2241137	Of course, they always get special editions in Japan, don't they?
2241177	2243379	This is Konami's kind of answer to the Final Fantasy series.
2243799	2245020	Some people say it's better.
2245600	2245961	Who knows?
2246761	2248162	It's really a matter of opinion.
2248823	2252906	It's going to come with a 200-page book with character illustrations because, of course...
2253446	2260889	The kind of niche of Suikoden is that you have like 100 different, like what is it, 101 in some games, 108 in others, playable characters.
2261749	2262970	108, it's 108 stars.
2263010	2264630	I forget, that's like the big catch of Suikoden.
2265110	2273574	They're also going to have an arranged soundtrack, written musical scores, art in the book and everything, fold-out cardboard, art board.
2274234	2276835	It's going to be great, so check that out, Suikoden.
2277776	2279297	Will they do the same thing in the US?
2280879	2281339	Probably not.
2281619	2282280	But write Konami.
2282320	2282921	Tell them you want it.
2283101	2283902	You never know what might happen.
2284963	2285984	Loki, you got anything else for us?
2286425	2287285	Yeah, I've got a few things.
2288727	2292211	First off, I was going to mention the...
2294497	2301699	Australia is actually getting the Australian Game Developers Conference 2005 Developing Dreams.
2302439	2319443	The 5th edition of the Developers and Publishers Matchmaking Business Convention will take place on December 5th, 6th, and 7th and will be back to some French and basically they're going to have tons of publishers.
2319503	2322624	Sounds like kind of their version of E3 so to speak.
2323224	2323284	Um
2324224	2329608	including all the big names, you know, Nintendo, Sega, Sony, etc.
2331989	2335171	I'm glad they're getting a little love down there in Australia with all that, so that's good.
2335391	2337172	I hope some of our listeners down there get to go to that.
2337613	2338773	Yeah, should be pretty cool.
2340334	2340835	Let's see.
2341475	2349440	Other things, coming out of the woodwork, of course, it looks like Joystick found a patent for their virtual...
2351198	2352819	Emulation for these old systems.
2352859	2358403	And one of the things that was kind of interesting for it is that you select your character before you select your game.
2359884	2362646	That could be very interesting, playing different characters in different games.
2362986	2365208	Running around as Mario in Zelda or something.
2365228	2365788	Who did this?
2366749	2367850	This is actually a patent.
2367890	2370992	Joystick found it on the US Patent Center.
2371012	2371752	Who owns the patent?
2372393	2372893	Nintendo.
2373274	2373774	Oh, Nintendo.
2373834	2374514	Okay, okay.
2374835	2377116	So this is supposedly what they're going to be using for...
2379198	2379719	The Revolution
2402452	2405713	DarkSakura, you have some release dates for some stuff coming up.
2405833	2406174	I sure do.
2406194	2408195	I have our December release dates for the UK.
2421994	2436766	Call of Duty 2, Gun Cameo, Madden NFL, Need for Speed, Miss One, Perfect Dark Zero, King Kong, Project Gotham Racing 3 Psychonauts
2439244	2451789	Ski Racing 2006, Rugby Challenge 2006, Tiger Woods PGA Tour 2006, Tony Hawk's American Wasteland, Frantics, and also Bubble Bobble Revolution for the DS.
2451909	2452329	Cool!
2454109	2454750	Yep, and Amps 3.
2455490	2457231	I haven't even heard of Bubble Bobble Revolution.
2457291	2458771	Is that something we're getting here in the U.S.?
2458991	2459391	I think so.
2459631	2460732	Dude, I want that.
2461292	2462172	I don't care if it sucks.
2462232	2463053	It's Bubble Bobble.
2464398	2464839	Final Fantasy 4
2479195	2483897	Animal Crossing Wild Worlds Animal Crossing Wild Worlds is going to be coming out for the DS.
2484117	2488119	You've got Super Mario Strikers for those people that like those Mario sports games.
2488139	2490240	Let's see what else.
2490900	2494201	You've also got a bunch of PSP games, actually.
2494221	2498603	You've got WWE vs. SmackDown 06 coming out for the PSP.
2499003	2503245	As well, of course, Dead or Alive 4 is coming out for the 360, which will be really good.
2503725	2504926	And then some more...
2506511	2510612	There's actually another game coming out on December 14th, Darwinia.
2510652	2513633	It will be available for download for $19.95.
2513673	2514353	Is this US or UK or both?
2529520	2533182	Actually, it says 1995 in dollars, so I'm assuming it's American.
2533222	2533582	Very cool.
2534563	2540025	They are actually saying, though, that soon after it's released, there will be a multiplayer version on the way.
2541266	2542347	Now, what is Darwinny all about?
2542367	2543627	Because I'm not very familiar with this one.
2543827	2547829	I didn't have too much time to look into it, but I think it's more of a virtual universe.
2548590	2552452	One of our listeners emailed me on this.
2552472	2552892	I remember this.
2552912	2553312	I remember this.
2553352	2553992	Okay, great.
2554373	2554633	Cool.
2555693	2556033	Sounds good.
2556053	2556874	What's the website for that?
2556994	2557294	Do we know?
2557594	2558575	I just closed it.
2558595	2558735	Sorry.
2559415	2562197	Actually, I think the company that makes it is called Steam.
2563537	2564898	Or just Google it.
2564998	2565598	I'm sure it'll come up.
2565638	2566159	Darwinia.
2567219	2569461	Loki, I noticed you have this up on the screen right now.
2569501	2570781	This is kind of PSP related.
2570961	2572022	I'm really curious about this.
2572082	2573923	Is this the Namco Volume 2 collection?
2573943	2577565	Yep, Namco Battle Collection Volume 2, which has been announced.
2577585	2581627	It has 11 original games and 2 arranged games.
2582668	2586830	And basically, the list of games, we've got King and Balloon.
2587911	2590913	Um, Boskania, or Boskanian or whatever.
2591273	2591853	Bosconian.
2591973	2592614	Bosconian.
2592754	2593134	There you go.
2593174	2593694	Not a mistake.
2594134	2598957	Um, Xevious, uh, Mappy, The Tower of Yraga.
2598977	2601578	How many fucking times do we need to see Mappy though?
2601638	2605240	Seriously, I mean Mappy's been in every Namco collection since the dawn of time.
2605300	2605921	They need to do Mappy Land.
2606601	2610323	I do, Mappy's cool and all, but seriously, I'm done with Mappy.
2611083	2612644	There's one game I'm disappointed that's not in there.
2612664	2612964	What's that?
2613165	2613865	Legend of Valkyrie.
2615180	2621906	Grubda, Dragon Buster, Dig Dug 2, Modos, Rolling Thunder, Dragon Spirit, Pac-Man Arrangement Plus Pac-Man and Modos Arrangement Why would they arrange Modos?
2621926	2622946	Is there a Modos fan club I'm unaware of?
2645010	2653154	But anyways, it's slated for the Japanese market in February 23rd, 2006.
2653774	2664199	It's actually going to be priced at only 3,990 yen, and a lot cheaper than the original game, which was 5,040 yen.
2664499	2670502	And the Japanese release is not yet scheduled, but probably will be soon after.
2670582	2671402	And I'm sure we'll get it.
2672309	2672909	I'm sure we will
2695526	2697067	Thank you for watching.
2697087	2698448	See you next time.
2717639	2726041	This is interesting because Guitar Hero is actually going to be featured on MTV, which shouldn't be too much of a surprise because you see the MTV logo when you boot up the game.
2726421	2735862	However, they're going to really be whoring out Guitar Hero on MTV on the cable, including MTV, MTV2, the MTV University channel, and MTV.com.
2736282	2739523	This is a partnership between MTV Games and Red Octane.
2740723	2745024	For the first time, rock music is not in the background, but instead it is the game.
2746325	2748287	Quote there from CEO Red Octane.
2748427	2750268	Well, you know who their other partnership is with, right?
2750508	2751069	Well, Harmonix.
2751089	2751790	Gibson Guitars.
2751950	2752450	Oh, that too.
2752890	2754552	Yeah.
2755313	2762179	Because if you actually look through your unlocks, every guitar in that game is a Gibson guitar down to their classics.
2763636	2766338	Speaking of MTV, I find this very interesting.
2766418	2769841	They are really pushing to get more game-oriented content recently.
2769921	2774765	Not only did they pick this up, but they bought GameTrailers.com.
2775066	2780590	They have assimilated it into its MTV cube or whatever you want to call it.
2780670	2782091	It's interesting.
2782212	2783733	Nice, it'll load even slower now.
2786289	2787989	It's uniqueness will join the collective.
2789030	2789350	All right.
2790870	2799332	Of course, you can't play video games all day long because if you played video games all day long, you'd have no time to go out and live a rock and roll lifestyle.
2799712	2811195	So to remind you that there is a world out there outside of video games, DarkSakura is here to present you her advice column, some life tips to just remind you that there's a whole world out there.
2811255	2811855	Go explore it.
2811915	2813616	DarkSakura, what are you giving us tips on tonight?
2813996	2816017	Today's tip is how to ram the barricade.
2816717	2818518	Oh, like if you're running away from the cops or something?
2818979	2819319	Sort of.
2819339	2819659	Okay, cool.
2819679	2821180	Or if you're trying to break into somebody's yard.
2821280	2821800	Oh, okay, cool.
2822420	2825382	Number one, identify the barricade's weakest point.
2825742	2832666	The side of the barricade or gate that opens or the place where a lock holds it closed is usually the most vulnerable spot.
2833506	2835347	Number two, aim for the weak spot.
2835827	2839009	If possible, use the rear of your car to ram the weak spot in the barricade.
2839449	2842331	Ramming the front end may damage the engine and cause the car to stall.
2850095	2852596	3.
2850255	2852596	Accelerate to a speed of 30-45 mph.
2853156	2856957	Jug just before impact if you are heading toward an extremely tall barricade or fence.
2857377	2860719	Pieces of the barricade may come through your window, or the window may shatter.
2861519	2869442	But my final piece of advice, don't try to go ram your way into the Neverland Ranch because Michael Jackson is so not worth it.
2874301	2875822	Womp, womp, womp, Loki!
2876323	2878724	Any closing stories for us tonight, because we're about ready to wrap it up?
2879205	2879865	A few things.
2880045	2882967	Unfortunately, Australia will not be seeing the 360 until March 2nd.
2883008	2884489	Hopefully then they won't overheat.
2885649	2893435	Yeah, honestly, Australia, I know you're pissed about this, but maybe the consoles will be a little more fine-tuned by the time you get them.
2894236	2898339	If you need a reason why they hate Best Buy even more, apparently it's been...
2899122	2909541	Shown that on numerous occasions, and this is not surprising one bit, they've been lying about how many Xboxes they're getting and employees have been pocketing them and selling them on eBay.
2910795	2911536	Oh, snap.
2911596	2912397	That is dirty.
2912577	2913978	That is dirty.
2913998	2922424	I thought it was pretty... I understand the need to get the game systems to your employees as well, but I always thought it was kind of shady when too many of them are going to the employees.
2922444	2931692	You really got to... If there's somebody working for you that just comes in on the weekends, do they really get that same priority that maybe the manager of the store has?
2931892	2932252	I don't know.
2932672	2933473	Kind of interesting.
2933813	2934214	I don't know.
2934774	2937516	I did happen to actually see some of the faceplates that they have for the 360.
2937556	2937636	Ugly.
2940319	2941600	That's all I gotta say.
2941960	2945381	Should not be spending the extra money on faceplates.
2945441	2947803	Well, there were some cool ones we talked about on a previous podcast.
2947823	2949323	Like if you're a Star Wars fan and all that.
2949543	2950964	I remember that from a previous show.
2950984	2951364	Yeah, okay.
2951404	2952605	Well, it comes down to this, folks.
2952685	2956107	If you really want a different faceplate, there are websites out there.
2956167	2959628	I believe Xbox 360 skins or something like that.
2960209	2962390	You can actually design your own.
2962990	2963970	Have it the way you want it.
2964231	2965911	They have some really cool ones on that site.
2966031	2967032	Make an Orange Lounge Radio one.
2967743	2970645	I thought about doing that and don't get ahead of me now.
2972126	2982614	One of the things I thought was pretty cool that they were showing is the development team for the Xbox 360 have gotten their own special edition version of the Xbox, which is pretty badass.
2982634	2988898	They've got concept art as well as just some different green highlights on the controller.
2989479	2990019	That's a neat one.
2990219	2991820	Which is pretty cool, I think.
2992161	2994462	So I wonder how long before we see that on eBay.
2994963	2995303	And then...
2996933	3000156	My favorite thing, which I was just checking this out.
3001297	3007802	Basically, they're going to say that Animal Crossing DS is going to be an extremely well-selling game.
3008123	3011125	They're saying it might actually outsell Nintendogs.
3012146	3019632	And so far, they've indicated that they've pre-sold 300,000 units, which beats out Nintendogs by almost double.
3019692	3019993	Yeah.
3020928	3028371	You know, Mario Kart DS also, and I don't think this came up in any other story, but Mario Kart had a great first week.
3028431	3037815	They say that like 41% of people that own Mario Kart DS went online with it in the first week as compared to 18% went online with Halo 2.
3038275	3041536	And speaking of Nintendogs, they've already sold 1 million in Europe.
3042546	3043086	Wow!
3043606	3044467	One million copies.
3044487	3046388	I haven't fed my puppies in a month.
3046768	3047228	Me neither.
3047288	3048408	My doggies are long dead.
3048569	3050029	I am so done with that game.
3050569	3055632	And then the game everybody should check out, which is coming out this week, Mario and Luigi Partners in Time.
3056272	3059173	Oh, that's kind of the... Mario and Luigi Super Saga 2.
3059613	3060454	Yeah, that's cool.
3061434	3062054	That game was fun.
3062154	3062634	That's a good time.
3063255	3066256	Maybe if I can take a break from playing Dragon Quest, I'll check that out.
3067617	3070598	Alright, one last story for you guys tonight, and then we'll wrap it up.
3072119	3086048	A study by the Entertainment Software Association says that 31% of Americans plan to engage in a game exchange this year, meaning that somebody's got a game on their Christmas list.
3086568	3089110	So it might not just be the hardcore gamers out there.
3089150	3092133	It sounds like a lot of people out there want to get their hands on a game.
3092854	3099139	They're saying 49% of homes with children aged 12 to 17 will give or get a game this year.
3100961	3109188	Only 43% when we're talking kids under 12, and 22% in a home without children, which I think is still a pretty big number there, so...
3110015	3115902	Gaming is definitely making a bigger and bigger step in our culture here.
3116282	3118284	And finally... No, I had the last say.
3118324	3118625	No!
3119145	3119546	Fine.
3120006	3120467	One last one.
3120487	3121027	God damn it.
3121828	3122949	Listen, I'm done.
3122969	3123350	This is it.
3123430	3124411	The last one.
3124491	3129837	Family Media Guide has released their list of the 10 most ultra-violent video games.
3130317	3132518	that you would want not to buy.
3132918	3136200	Oh, in other words, these are the ten games on my Christmas list.
