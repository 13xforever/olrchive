1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Monkey, monkey, monkey, monkey, a monkey, monkey, monkey, I'm gonna be a monkey, a monkey, monkey, monkey, would you like to be one too?

2
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Okay, if you wanna be a monkey, you gotta learn to act like a monkey.

3
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,000
And I've got to know how, cause I've seen every garden movie ever made.

4
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
So watch and learn!

5
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Hey everybody! I just made up a song and I hope you can sing along with me.

6
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:41,000
It's called I'm a Cucumber. Here we go. One, two, three, four.

7
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:49,000
I'm a cucumber. I'm a cucumber. I'm a cucumber. I'm a cucumber.

8
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:56,960
I'm a cucumber, I'm a cucumber, please don't take me to the pickle farm, bum!

9
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:02,060

I know that. And God knows what else tonight on the really big program. We'll be back after this.

43
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:39,960

00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:40,960
You might know me as Sky.

00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:43,760
Joining me, as always, are my awesome co-hosts in this corner.

46
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:46,760
Welcome back, the happiest bunny on the farm, Dark Sakura.

47
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:47,760
Hi.

48
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:50,520
How are you?

49
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:51,520
I don't know.

50
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:58,160
You say you're still coughing right now, that's not picking up on the mic, but you don't sound

51
00:04:58,160 --> 00:04:59,160
sick.

52
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:03,080
Like the last two weeks, you sounded sick, but now it's kind of one of those, you obviously

53
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:05,880
have a virus or something, because you don't sound sick.

54
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:06,880
I don't have a virus.

55
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:07,880
It's bacterial.

56
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:10,880
My voice does, on occasion, come and go.

57
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:12,880
That's why I didn't really talk much today.

58
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:14,880
Yeah, but you sound pretty solid tonight, so good job.

59
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:17,880
I apparently have whooping cough now.

60
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:21,880
Yeah, we're going to play the Wheel of Infection, I think Sloky called it.

61
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:23,880
Wheel of Infection, turn, turn, turn.

62
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:25,880
Show us which disease Jamie should have.

63
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:29,880
The thing is that whooping cough is something you're inoculated against when you're younger.

64
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:36,880
Only it apparently has something like some 10, 20% chance of hitting you when you're older.

65
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:43,600
fun huh exciting yay diseases so we'll be talking diseases with jamie tonight also in that corner

66
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:49,520
we'll be talking hamburgers with loki i'm almost done how how how is your biggest gainer adventure

67
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:55,040
going it's it's going i haven't had mcdonald's though in a week at least well that's that's

68
00:05:55,040 --> 00:06:01,040
at least an accomplishment i mean i had um turkey this week so all right no time for mcdonald's but

69
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:05,920
no i actually just i kind of wanted some quick didn't have anything so i got two cheeseburgers

70
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:08,920
which is a lot better than having like a double quarter pounder, I mean, obviously.

71
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:14,920
I guess, but you know what would be really good would be like one of those fruit and walnut salads would be a really good choice.

72
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:15,920
Well there's a problem here, I don't eat-

73
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:16,920
That's actually worse.

74
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:17,920
Really?

75
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:18,920
I don't eat salad.

76
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:20,920
If you use half the walnuts, don't use walnuts.

77
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:23,920
The heavy sugar, I mean it's candy walnuts.

78
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:26,920
Only I only use half the walnuts, cause I know that they're candy walnuts and they're not that great.

79
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:29,920
And dried fruit is even higher in sugar than, yes it is.

80
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:30,920
And I don't like nuts.

81
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:31,920
It concentrates the sugar.

82
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:39,920
I hate the regulars. I don't like their regular salads. If I'm going to get a regular salad, I want like Fresh Choice, a real salad place. I can't do McDonald's salads. But anyway.

83
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:43,920
I'm eating one of their salads right now and I find it highly tasty. I don't like it. I can't do it.

84
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:50,920
I hate salads. I hate the taste of lettuce. I've tried it numerous times. I do not like lettuce. It's awful.

85
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:52,920
Lettuce is something I used to hate as a child, but I like it now.

86
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:55,920
I don't care for lettuce. I prefer spinach and it has spinach in it.

87
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:58,920
Spinach is good. Anyway, we'll talk plenty of food later throughout the show.

88
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:03,160
throughout the show but also say hello to the one and only mikatov

89
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:07,240
are you playing mario kart online right now? no i'm trying to unlock rob

90
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:10,800
well i'm right here

91
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:11,600
got him funny

92
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:16,360
he's working on the chassis he built

93
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:19,620
i somehow highly doubt that

94
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:22,640
how far are you in unlocking rob you almost there?

95
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:25,280
uh... i have like two more races and then yeah

96
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:28,080
i think that will stop interrupting him entities

97
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:31,240
he's very thin like in playing his mario kart over there so will

98
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:37,240
we'll take a break mario kart today if you actually doing the show

99
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:37,980
again

100
00:07:37,980 --> 00:07:39,500
i refuse to play

101
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:42,040
when we get it i want more information on this when we come back we're gonna

102
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:43,200
take a quick break though

103
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:47,120
uh... and i can't wait to tell this week so i'm in a very ten stylish mood

104
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:49,480
uh... so we're placing music content style

105
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:51,480
and we'll come back and to our show

106
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:54,120
sojourner charam dedicated or something to come

107
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:58,120
we'll be right back after this first started off with uh...

108
00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:01,160
start up with a strong a song called strong woman

109
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:02,620
was the s songs

110
00:08:02,620 --> 00:08:05,560
hopefully it works out i just got this before the show started so i hope it

111
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:06,180
works

112
00:08:06,180 --> 00:08:13,180
with that as a moral

113
00:09:36,180 --> 00:10:04,180
I didn't get a chance to cry But I just ain't got no way to go

114
00:10:34,180 --> 00:10:44,180
I'm gone.

115
00:10:44,180 --> 00:10:49,180
I'm gone.

116
00:10:49,180 --> 00:10:52,180
Well, I was just a friend for you.

117
00:10:52,180 --> 00:10:56,180
I won't let you down.

118
00:10:56,180 --> 00:10:59,180
I can't.

119
00:10:59,180 --> 00:11:02,180
Will it be all right?

120
00:11:02,180 --> 00:11:07,180
I'm going down to Redwood, I'm gonna have to yell

121
00:11:08,180 --> 00:11:11,180
I can't hear you, I can't hear you

122
00:11:11,180 --> 00:11:13,180
10-1-1

123
00:15:41,180 --> 00:16:07,820
Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio, we're in the middle of episode number 165,

124
00:16:07,820 --> 00:16:08,820
if you can believe it.

125
00:16:08,820 --> 00:16:10,620
I was just kind of thinking about today, you know,

126
00:16:10,620 --> 00:16:16,320
165 doesn't sound like a big number. Would you consider that that's one a week?

127
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:18,620
That is an awfully long time. 165 weeks.

128
00:16:18,620 --> 00:16:22,500
And that doesn't even count weeks off and stuff, because we're entitled to a week off once in a while, dammit.

129
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:23,460
Yes, Loki?

130
00:16:23,460 --> 00:16:26,260
Thought. You have your finger up in thought.

131
00:16:26,260 --> 00:16:27,900
Your mic's not on, but...

132
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:29,220
Why'd you turn the mic off?

133
00:16:29,220 --> 00:16:31,460
Bad you.

134
00:16:31,460 --> 00:16:35,060
Is 169 going to be on New Year's Eve?

135
00:16:35,060 --> 00:16:38,820
I don't know, but we have to decide and we can worry about this next month if we're going

136
00:16:38,820 --> 00:16:39,820
to do shit.

137
00:16:39,820 --> 00:16:42,020
Because I think, isn't Christmas and New Year's Eve on a Sunday this year?

138
00:16:42,020 --> 00:16:43,020
Yep.

139
00:16:43,020 --> 00:16:44,020
Both are.

140
00:16:44,020 --> 00:16:45,020
See, I don't know if we want to do shows then.

141
00:16:45,020 --> 00:16:48,940
I don't know about you, but I'm not going to be here on Christmas.

142
00:16:48,940 --> 00:16:52,140
Yeah, New Year's Eve, definitely not, because there's other things I've got to do.

143
00:16:52,140 --> 00:16:54,380
So we might be taking some time off for the holidays.

144
00:16:54,380 --> 00:16:55,380
And you know what?

145
00:16:55,380 --> 00:16:56,380
We earned it.

146
00:16:56,380 --> 00:16:57,380
So shut up.

147
00:16:57,380 --> 00:16:58,380
No one's going to be listening.

148
00:16:58,380 --> 00:16:59,380
Anyways, they're going to be out.

149
00:16:59,380 --> 00:17:01,340
We'll do a marathon or something special.

150
00:17:01,340 --> 00:17:04,860
We'll pre-record a little special treat for, yeah, nobody's going to want to listen to

151
00:17:04,860 --> 00:17:09,660
on New Year's Eve. Come on. People are going to go out to parties and stuff. Maybe the

152
00:17:09,660 --> 00:17:13,660
dude that records us every week will record the station to see what was here. Actually,

153
00:17:13,660 --> 00:17:18,700
there's several people that are recording us, but I don't see a big demand for programming

154
00:17:18,700 --> 00:17:24,900
on New Year's Eve. Now, I've got to talk to Jess over at DDR Freak and see if we want

155
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:29,400
to do something special on New Year's Day again, although I don't know. The last time

156
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:34,300
I proposed the idea, it was kind of this general meh across the board, so we'll have to see.

157
00:17:34,300 --> 00:17:36,300
I was kind of met with this general, meh.

158
00:17:36,300 --> 00:17:38,300
We'll see.

159
00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:43,300
Are you sure that any of us are going to be in any shape to do any kind of broadcasting on New Year's Day?

160
00:17:43,300 --> 00:17:47,300
Now, last year it went okay. Everybody had a hangover, but it went okay.

161
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:49,300
Who doesn't get hangovers in this room?

162
00:17:49,300 --> 00:17:51,300
That would be me!

163
00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:53,300
Okay, granted, but you know.

164
00:17:53,300 --> 00:17:54,300
And me?

165
00:17:54,300 --> 00:17:56,300
Oh, whatever. I don't care.

166
00:17:56,300 --> 00:18:00,300
I can't get near alcohol poisoning, but I don't get hangovers. Go, Gray.

167
00:18:00,300 --> 00:18:02,140

stories

with the hallmark trimmer

179
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:40,540
uh... let's see what else they say in general there um... nobody's doing us

180
00:18:40,540 --> 00:18:43,180
for not wanting to do a christmas episode

181
00:18:43,180 --> 00:18:45,220
bitches

182
00:18:45,220 --> 00:18:47,960
well excuse me maybe we'd like to spend time with our families

183
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:51,200
we want to open up presents that's a very important part of christmas day

184
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:53,800
i want christmas nookie dammit and i'm not going to be here

185
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:57,800
Exactly! I want Christmas Nookie, too.

186
00:18:57,800 --> 00:19:00,800
Anyway, how was Thanksgiving? Did you get any Thanksgiving Nookie?

187
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:03,800
No. I'm still too sick.

188
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:08,800
I ate my food, and then I got in such a bad headache

189
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:11,800
while trying to watch Dan play Perfect Dark Zero,

190
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:15,800
which was a very pretty, very pretty game.

191
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:17,800
Actually, it wasn't Dan who was giving me the headache,

192
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:20,800
it was watching his friend who completely sucks at that game

193
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:26,360
being, like, an absolute retard playing it. So, uh, I, uh, I mean, it was, it was really

194
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:32,120
making some dumb mistakes. So, uh, I just sort of laid back and, uh, threw a pillow

195
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:37,120
on Dan's lap and passed out. And I actually did fall asleep for something like two hours.

196
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:42,120
But you're sick, so you can. I still feel crappy.

197
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:46,320
I'm starting to get a sore throat. I wonder if you've infected me.

198
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:50,320
If I have whipping cough, it's highly contagious.

199
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:55,320
But if you've already been inoculated, you have an 80% chance of not getting it.

200
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:57,320
Well, we'll see.

201
00:19:57,320 --> 00:20:00,320
I don't know. We're probably all going to be sick next week. It'll be horrible.

202
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:02,320
I might.

203
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:06,320
Anyway, as long as we're talking about Thanksgiving, we might as well talk about your week and your day.

204
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:08,320
So, Dark Sakura, how was your week? How was your day?

205
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:10,320
How was my month?

206
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:14,320
How was your month? It's been a little while since I've been here.

207
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:18,960
It involves lung cookies and homework, and that's about it.

208
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:21,240
I slept 16 hours yesterday.

209
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:23,960
I slept 17 hours last Saturday.

210
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:27,240
I had lung spasms at work Friday and had

211
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:29,480
to go home the week before.

212
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:32,680
And yeah, I've been really, really crappy sick

213
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:34,920
and haven't even felt much like playing anything,

214
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:37,600
let alone sitting up and going to work.

215
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:40,720
But I did play.

216
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:43,520
I opened World of Warcraft and then shut it down.

217
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:48,420
And then last night around 1 a.m. I played some We Love Katamari

218
00:20:48,420 --> 00:20:51,380
and then started getting really motion sick.

219
00:20:51,380 --> 00:20:55,300
It's like my stomach has gone between being ravenously hungry and being very

220
00:20:55,300 --> 00:20:57,500
nauseated.

221
00:20:57,500 --> 00:21:03,740
So, trying to play We Love Katamari while being highly nauseated anyway just spells disaster.

222
00:21:03,740 --> 00:21:08,300
Spells don't make any plans, because it's all coming up.

223
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:11,600
That's one way of explaining it, I suppose.

224
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:13,360
working out your weekend

225
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:16,460
my week was good because there is turkey involved uh...

226
00:21:16,460 --> 00:21:17,400
and then

227
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:21,980
it you know is very chaotic we got my car fixed finally

228
00:21:21,980 --> 00:21:23,640
and that was cool so

229
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:25,040
then i had turkey

230
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:26,480
that was also good

231
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:27,780
under the rest of the week

232
00:21:27,780 --> 00:21:30,160
you know last four days is really trying to be productive

233
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:33,640
but that didn't happen

234
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:37,220
no instead i'd kind of watered around a black friday trying to see if there's

235
00:21:37,220 --> 00:21:39,520
any three sixties around

236
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:45,520
Oh, give me a break! I mean, would you really think you were going to find a 360 on Black Friday?

237
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:48,920
No, I just wanted to get out of the house.

238
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:52,680
So I went and picked up another game for the 360 I don't have yet.

239
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:57,520
So I have Cameo now. Luckily there's a used copy. Someone already put out a used copy.

240
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:01,800
That's interesting. It's probably a review copy or something.

241
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:03,160
Something like that.

242
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:07,800
Yeah, not like any of the copies I bring back are. Anyways, then I went to Best Buy

243
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:14,680
and wandered around there for about a few seconds. They have quite a few Xboxes and

244
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:21,620
the PS2 Slims. They were blocking off aisles with them. I'm like, okay, I get the point

245
00:22:21,620 --> 00:22:27,280
that you have lots of these systems available. Not the one I'm looking for, but I don't know.

246
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:31,420
I just kind of fed up with Best Buy. Dude, why were people lined up at 10 o'clock

247
00:22:31,420 --> 00:22:36,880
Thanksgiving evening outside Best Buy, like they were camped out for Black Friday? Can

248
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:38,880
Can you give a microphone to make it sound?

249
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:40,880
There were like computers for like $150.

250
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:42,880
Diesel ones?

251
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:44,880
I think so. Yeah, and laptops for like $200.

252
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:47,880
Wow. I don't know. Hell, maybe I should have camped out too.

253
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:51,880
They had some HP computers or something. I don't know.

254
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:54,880
I just didn't really want it.

255
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:58,880
Didn't Walmart do some type of like $400 laptop or something too?

256
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:01,880
They were talking about it and I don't know if they did or not.

257
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:03,880
It was a big mess.

258
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:10,880
But, um, I actually went to GameStop, um, that day, thinking, oh, well, the GameStop by my house is normally not crowded at all.

259
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:16,880
They have, like, a friggin' line of seven people in there, like, at about noon. It was crazy.

260
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:29,880
Because I wanted to see, first off, where it was on the Xbox 360, you know, pre-orders, and, um, also, you know, whether or not they had any accessories and stuff, and possibly games.

261
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:40,880
But now I'm to the point now I have the four games I kind of wanted, and there's really nothing else I want, um, except for maybe DOA 4, but, um, once that comes out, there's nothing I want for at least a few months.

262
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:49,880
And, actually, looking at my list of games coming out, there's nothing coming out for the 360 until February.

263
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:53,880
It's like PSP syndrome all over again, or Nintendo DS.

264
00:23:53,880 --> 00:24:05,880
That's crazy though, I mean, even, excluding the delay on Dead or Alive 4, you would actually have two months of nothing for the 360, and I mean, that's pretty bad.

265
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:07,880
When's that Baldur's Gate coming out? Did that get pushed all the way back to February?

266
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:09,880
Elder Scrolls is coming out in April or March.

267
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:10,880
Why did I say Baldur's Gate?

268
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:16,880
It's Elder Scrolls, I think March now, or March or April, I can't remember.

269
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:20,880
The only big games coming out in December is nothing.

270
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:26,880
The only real game worth mentioning is actually just Gauntlet Seven Sorrows.

271
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:30,880
That's it. That and Dead or Alive, because Dead or Alive got pushed back.

272
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:34,880
Gauntlet Seven Sorrows is also coming out on the other systems too, so it doesn't really matter.

273
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:36,880
Well, that's not on the 360, I'm just talking games in general.

274
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:37,880
Oh, shit.

275
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:43,880
And then for the month of January, 25 to life, which would be pretty big.

276
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:56,880
Well, January is a very slow period for games, just as it is for movies, because after the holidays, there's really nothing up again until the early spring period.

277
00:24:56,880 --> 00:25:02,880
Probably there's going to be a very big lull between the holidays and probably summer. There usually is.

278
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:04,880
Yeah, it should be...

279
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:08,880
There's a couple of big titles in February and March. I think we're getting Prime Hunters on the DS somewhere in there.

280
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:12,880
March? Yeah. Well, you get a couple of big titles. That's about it.

281
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:20,880
I don't know. I'm thinking now I gotta put down my money for a Revolution and a PS3 if I want them.

282
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:30,880
PS3 I'm not so worried about because they haven't even really announced a date for that yet, and I'm thinking it's not going to be until the fall anyways of next year.

283
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:32,880
Revolution, though, I'd be wanting to pick up.

284
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:35,880
I think Revolution and PS3 will both be out by next Christmas, I really do.

285
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:39,880
I think they're gonna rush them just like Xbox Rush to get out there, but I think they'll be out there by Christmas.

286
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:41,880
Revolution, they've been taking their time on, so...

287
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:45,880
Yeah, but I think, you know, the fact that they haven't said a lot about it, I think is a good sign.

288
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:48,880
I think it's gonna be like a Nintendo 64 launch.

289
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:52,880
Comet? Sorry.

290
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:57,880
I'm just seeing the 360 going the way of the Dreamcast.

291
00:25:57,880 --> 00:25:58,880
Interesting.

292
00:25:58,880 --> 00:25:59,880
There's a lot in common.

293
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:04,980
I saw that story on 1UP.com that shared what they had in common, but that's the same marketing

294
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:07,540
guys behind them both, isn't it?

295
00:26:07,540 --> 00:26:08,840
I don't get the commercials.

296
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:09,840
They're stupid.

297
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:11,840
I haven't even seen an Xbox 360 commercial, but I...

298
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:15,160
Well, you probably don't even realize it is an Xbox 360 commercial unless you watch it

299
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:18,560
all the way through, because they don't say or show anything about the Xbox 360.

300
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:25,080
They show kids playing in really cryptic, artistic crap, and then they go, Xbox 360!

301
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:29,040
It reminds me of this commercial we made for our economics class.

302
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:34,640
It was basically a bunch of kick-ass clips of action sequences during movies, like explosions

303
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:39,360
and people getting beat up and stuff, and at the very end, buy bumper stickers.

304
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:40,360
And that was it.

305
00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:41,360
That was the whole thing.

306
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:47,480
And this is kind of like the whole 360 thing is, you know, you show a bunch of kids playing

307
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:51,960
and having a water balloon fight or something, 360, it's like, you look at it, you're like,

308
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:52,960
what the hell, I don't get it.

309
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:57,640
That doesn't say anything about the system, what it does, what it is, it just shows kids

310
00:26:57,640 --> 00:26:58,640
playing.

311
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:03,640
Okay, so the 360 is a watermelon launcher? I mean, what the hell is it?

312
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:06,640
It's stupid.

313
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:08,640
Makes me glad I don't watch TV.

314
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:13,640
I barely watch TV at all, and even the few shows I do watch, thanks to the lovely DVR we have,

315
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:17,640
I fast-forward through all the commercials, so I don't have to watch it.

316
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:20,640
So that's why I'm like, oh, there's a funny commercial? I don't know.

317
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:23,640
Anyway, anything else you want to share about your week and your day?

318
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:25,640
No, that's pretty much it.

319
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:30,720
I went to GameStop on Black Friday as well, but I went to the one near here, and the line

320
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:34,760
was only about one, two people, like it usually is, nothing extraordinary, although the store

321
00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:38,120
was crowded, but a lot of people that were in the store were just stupid kids, as are

322
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:42,640
usually in that GameStop, stupid kids, like a bunch of kids just randomly like ran out

323
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:45,800
of the store and ran out around the corner, and I thought they stole something or something,

324
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:50,640
but nobody ran after them, so I'm guessing that's a good sign, but yeah, GameStop around

325
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:53,640
here, just this particular one near me is very strange.

326
00:27:53,640 --> 00:28:00,560
Anyway, I picked up Dragon Quest VIII, because I'd seen that game earlier in the week, and

327
00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:04,640
it looked pretty cool, so I wanted to pick it up and play it.

328
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:07,120
And also the Final Fantasy XII demo, which is very, very sexy.

329
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:09,440
I'm going to let you borrow it so you can see it, because it's very sexy.

330
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:10,440
No need.

331
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:13,440
Oh, you already got it?

332
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:14,440
I found...

333
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:15,440
I found...

334
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:16,440
You acquired it.

335
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:17,440
I acquired it.

336
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:18,440
I see.

337
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:19,440
You acquired it through your various contacts.

338
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:21,540
Do you need it, or do you already have it?

339
00:28:21,540 --> 00:28:27,740
only about the final fantasy 12 demo which is pretty cool i have the trailer it's a playable

340
00:28:27,740 --> 00:28:33,340
demo this one oh no i don't you want to borrow it pretty cool okay very cool sounds like

341
00:28:33,340 --> 00:28:39,420
it was like 11 i just got the dragon warrior 9 or whatever one there's a whatever the new

342
00:28:39,420 --> 00:28:44,940
dragon dragon quest yeah about the actual game dragon quest 8 dragon warrior dragon

343
00:28:44,940 --> 00:28:50,220
Well, they re- they went back to their old quest, because Squeenix is doing this whole

344
00:28:50,220 --> 00:28:54,860
mea culpa. Yes, we did change the names of all your games. We released them in the U.S.

345
00:28:54,860 --> 00:29:01,340
for Nintendo through Nintendo. We fixed. I'll talk more about Drag Quest on the podcast,

346
00:29:01,340 --> 00:29:07,260
but yeah, I like that game. And been playing a little bit of Mario Kart here and there,

347
00:29:07,260 --> 00:29:13,740
and World of Warcraft a little bit, a little bit, not a whole lot though, and that's about

348
00:29:13,740 --> 00:29:14,740
it.

349
00:29:14,740 --> 00:29:21,020
I think what else I did in my personal life, as far as, oh, sorry, I'm using the crappy

350
00:29:21,020 --> 00:29:26,340
mic tonight, so if my voice fades in and out just because I'm on the crappy mic tonight.

351
00:29:26,340 --> 00:29:29,780
I didn't really do anything for Thanksgiving, because I have a small family, so it's just

352
00:29:29,780 --> 00:29:33,300
me, my mom, and my dad, so we just went out to eat, because my mom was like, forget it,

353
00:29:33,300 --> 00:29:36,780
I'm not going to spend 100 bucks on cookie turkey, just, you know, for three of us, so

354
00:29:36,780 --> 00:29:40,060
We went out to eat, which was cool, because we went to a fancy shmancy restaurant that

355
00:29:40,060 --> 00:29:44,380
was open on Thanksgiving, so it was nice to be, you know, snobby for a day.

356
00:29:44,380 --> 00:29:49,220
And that was about it for my Thanksgiving, I didn't do a whole lot else, I hung out with,

357
00:29:49,220 --> 00:29:51,860
you know, the guy I'm seeing the rest of the day, that was about it, because he didn't

358
00:29:51,860 --> 00:29:53,740
have a whole lot going on either.

359
00:29:53,740 --> 00:29:57,820
And that's about it.

360
00:29:57,820 --> 00:30:01,140
It's just been very nice to have these past few days off of work, because I'm not going

361
00:30:01,140 --> 00:30:04,780
to have a vacation like this again until like February, because I'm taking some massive

362
00:30:04,780 --> 00:30:10,580
time off in February, and it's just very nice to have a break. So I feel very charged, I'm

363
00:30:10,580 --> 00:30:17,260
very relaxed tonight. I hate this mic. I'm in a pretty decent mood, all things considered.

364
00:30:17,260 --> 00:30:23,700
But yeah. So Miklotov, you're here. I know you're in the middle of a race, but you gotta

365
00:30:23,700 --> 00:30:27,460
pause that for a minute. And of course we have to give the disclaimer that, you know,

366
00:30:27,460 --> 00:30:30,480
even though he works for Konami, don't read into too much of anything that he says, because

367
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:34,620
he's not here to represent Konami tonight, he's here to represent himself. Yes? As usual.

368
00:30:34,620 --> 00:30:36,620
So, how was your week? How was your day?

369
00:30:36,620 --> 00:30:39,620
My week was pretty boring because all I do is work.

370
00:30:39,620 --> 00:30:44,620
Mario Kart has taken over our office every break, almost every lunch.

371
00:30:44,620 --> 00:30:47,620
We play eight player matches. It's really fun.

372
00:30:47,620 --> 00:30:51,620
I love hearing that at Konami you'll play games by other people all the time.

373
00:30:51,620 --> 00:30:52,620
Of course.

374
00:30:52,620 --> 00:30:55,620
I'm sure all the other companies do it too. It's just kind of neat, you know.

375
00:30:55,620 --> 00:31:02,620
Yeah. We even use our DS's that we're not supposed to use for actual gaming to play because not everybody has a DS there.

376
00:31:02,620 --> 00:31:11,680
there and then I saw rent which is an amazing movie don't say anything it's

377
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:17,880
your moment I'll let you have your movie movie I saw it twice actually and I

378
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:25,920
picked up Brokeback Mountain two books of it and the soundtrack and it's

379
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:29,280
amazing how do you buy two books of Brokeback Mountain um well they

380
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:31,480
They released a standalone.

381
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:37,120
It's really just a short story from a collection of cowboy western stories.

382
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:40,920
So I picked up the book that had all those short stories in it, and then they also released

383
00:31:40,920 --> 00:31:47,080
the one for the movie that's coming out, and I picked that one up also, and the soundtrack.

384
00:31:47,080 --> 00:31:48,720
And I'm in love.

385
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:49,720
A lot.

386
00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:50,720
Okay.

387
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:51,720
And the movie comes out when?

388
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:52,720
December 9th.

389
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:57,760
I thought it was next week, and then to my horrible, horrible dismay, it's actually two

390
00:31:57,760 --> 00:32:02,640
weeks from now. So now next week's going to be depressing because that's all I was looking

391
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:08,160
forward to. I'm sorry. It's okay. There'll be other things to make you happy. Nope. Go

392
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:11,840
see Rent again, it'll make you feel better. No, I'm just going to have to read the book

393
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:17,280
every day like I planned on doing anyway. So speaking of work, any songs you've been

394
00:32:17,280 --> 00:32:23,840
hearing a lot at work lately? Any songs get stuck in your head? No. Anything that you've

395
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:27,760
Have you, by chance, maybe been spinning a turntable or making some, uh,

396
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:29,760
arrows, stomping noises too?

397
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:31,760
I refuse to, uh, comment.

398
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:32,760
Go ahead.

399
00:32:32,760 --> 00:32:33,760
Go ahead.

400
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:34,760
I have to try.

401
00:32:34,760 --> 00:32:36,760
The listeners would get angry and say that, you know, we're far, so I didn't try.

402
00:32:36,760 --> 00:32:37,760
Oh, oh, wait.

403
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:38,760
The Mario Kart music.

404
00:32:38,760 --> 00:32:43,280
Oh, and, and, and a lot of random 90s music I've been listening to at work lately, but

405
00:32:43,280 --> 00:32:46,400
nothing to do with DDR or anything like that, so don't read into that, just, that's what

406
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:49,640
I play when I'm doing work.

407
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:51,600
So I hear rhythm is a dancer a lot.

408
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:56,000
I've never... I don't know if I can say that. There was something that happened once that

409
00:32:56,000 --> 00:33:00,140
involved work and somebody hearing a song a lot that was really, really funny that happened

410
00:33:00,140 --> 00:33:01,140
once.

411
00:33:01,140 --> 00:33:02,140
Dave & Busters?

412
00:33:02,140 --> 00:33:06,680
Yeah. Can I say that on the air? I don't know. It's in the past, so I can say that now, right?

413
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:11,620
I won't say who it was. I'll just say somebody. It wasn't me. Somebody who also is very close

414
00:33:11,620 --> 00:33:12,880
with Konami said...

415
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:13,880
Used to be.

416
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:19,540
Yeah. Well, whatever. It was this song that was playing on the Dave & Busters radio station

417
00:33:19,540 --> 00:33:28,780
And she said, or he or she said, she said, he or she said, he or she said that, um, fuck,

418
00:33:28,780 --> 00:33:35,620
I don't know if I can continue the story now, I don't know if I can continue the story now

419
00:33:35,620 --> 00:33:37,380
because I don't want to get anybody in trouble.

420
00:33:37,380 --> 00:33:38,380
They don't work there anymore.

421
00:33:38,380 --> 00:33:39,380
Alright, it's fine.

422
00:33:39,380 --> 00:33:44,580
The person said that, oh man, I can't get this song out of my head because I've been

423
00:33:44,580 --> 00:33:48,260
hearing it at work so much lately, and I'm like, oh really?

424
00:33:48,260 --> 00:33:53,180
Turns out it was an Ultramix 2 license that nobody knew about yet at the time, so it was

425
00:33:53,180 --> 00:33:54,180
really funny.

426
00:33:54,180 --> 00:33:55,180
I don't know.

427
00:33:55,180 --> 00:33:56,180
Anyway, that's in the past.

428
00:33:56,180 --> 00:33:58,100
Oh, and the rest of my week was watching that Next clip constantly.

429
00:33:58,100 --> 00:34:00,100
Yo, what's that about?

430
00:34:00,100 --> 00:34:01,580
Tell them about the show that we watched.

431
00:34:01,580 --> 00:34:05,300
Hey, there's this show called The Soup on E!

432
00:34:05,300 --> 00:34:06,300
And they show...

433
00:34:06,300 --> 00:34:07,620
Yeah, it's great.

434
00:34:07,620 --> 00:34:12,540
They show clips of random TV shows, reality shows, other types of shows, and they have

435
00:34:12,540 --> 00:34:18,960
This clip of the MTV show called Next, and this stupid little Asian chick was getting

436
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:23,860
off the Next bus, because the whole premise of Next is you have these five people you're

437
00:34:23,860 --> 00:34:27,700
going to date for 20 minutes, pretty much, and you tell them next to get the next one

438
00:34:27,700 --> 00:34:29,200
to come out.

439
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:34,720
She's walking out of the van thing, and she's doing her little spiel for the camera.

440
00:34:34,720 --> 00:34:37,680
As she's saying that, she falls down the steps.

441
00:34:37,680 --> 00:34:43,600
It's really funny because they freeze frame on her falling down and she has the best expression

442
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:45,440
on her face.

443
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:48,440
It's somewhere between laughing and just shock.

444
00:34:48,440 --> 00:34:49,440
It's really great.

445
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:53,760
And she was a stupid whore anyway.

446
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:57,840
I love how he's like, I just wanted you to walk over here because I wasn't sure if you

447
00:34:57,840 --> 00:35:00,920
were okay or not, next!

448
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:04,520
That was nice.

449
00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:05,520
Let's see.

450
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:09,280
Oh, I know what I wanted to ask you about as well.

451
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:14,600
One little work-related thing that I'm okay to say, I think, is that you met L.E.D.

452
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:15,600
Yeah.

453
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:16,600
You met L.E.D.

454
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:17,600
How was that?

455
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:18,600
I got to have dinner with L.E.D.

456
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:19,600
Really?

457
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:20,600
Ooh, yeah.

458
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:21,600
Was it a nice dinner?

459
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:22,600
Like, did you guys go to a fancy restaurant?

460
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:23,600
We went to TGI Fridays, because he wanted American.

461
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:24,600
Well, that's good stuff.

462
00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:25,600
Yeah, it was pretty good.

463
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:28,760
Oh, and you probably can't say much about the details of what you guys talked about,

464
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:33,960
but anything interesting that you might be able to share, like, in, you know, is he...

465
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:41,640
Maybe, feel free to pass on this question if you have to, but does he seem to be aware

466
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:44,640
that he has quite a following here in the US?

467
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:53,240
I don't think that was brought up, but I think he would have to be stupid to know that.

468
00:35:53,240 --> 00:35:58,480
I don't know what I can really say from the dinner, but there was one funny thing.

469
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:03,400
He asked us, it was me and a couple of other people from work, and he asked us what types

470
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:08,400
of music we listened to, and I was saying, at the time it was like I was listening to

471
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:15,740
drum and bass a lot, and I also said Eurobeat, and he kind of groaned, and said Eurobeat

472
00:36:15,740 --> 00:36:18,600
after me, like, he was rather disgusted with that answer.

473
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:20,600
Aw, you make LED cry.

474
00:36:20,600 --> 00:36:21,600
I thought it was funny.

475
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:22,600
You make LED cry.

476
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:23,600
I do.

477
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:24,600
That's great.

478
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:25,600
Yeah, it was funny.

479
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:26,600
That's cool.

480
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:27,600
Mm-hmm.

481
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:28,600
Good job.

482
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:31,880
All right, moving on, if you have nothing else to say for now.

483
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:32,880
Nope.

484
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:34,880
Brokeback Mountain's awesome.

485
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:08,120
something. You know what I think is interesting is that finally after this website's been

486
00:37:08,120 --> 00:37:11,400
running for about three and a half years now, people are considering us like a legitimate

487
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:15,220
news source. So just for the record, where do you, remind our audience where you get

488
00:37:15,220 --> 00:37:20,920
your information and why it's pretty reliable. My information comes directly from our buyer

489
00:37:20,920 --> 00:37:26,240
because our buyer talks to Konami directly. I mean, these are, they give us the dates

490
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:30,580
so we know when product's coming out, so we know when we can sell it, when orders are

491
00:37:30,580 --> 00:37:35,260
do, etc. So we have to know what the upcoming slate of titles is gonna be, and that's how

492
00:37:35,260 --> 00:37:41,460
I know what movie titles and game titles, because I work at a freaking distributor,

493
00:37:41,460 --> 00:37:47,700
so you have to know what's coming out when, so that's the tentative date. But, you know,

494
00:37:47,700 --> 00:37:54,420
like, most games, dates shift around, like, weekly. So, you know, what might be March

495
00:37:54,420 --> 00:38:03,260
today, could be January, could be March, or April, who knows? Like, for example, Tomb Raider,

496
00:38:03,260 --> 00:38:07,980
the new one, Tomb Raider Legends, or whatever it was. The Tomb Raider, I don't care anymore.

497
00:38:07,980 --> 00:38:12,860
Yeah, Tomb Raider, trying to reinvent herself, Tomb Raider. Anyway, that game was originally

498
00:38:12,860 --> 00:38:17,700
slated for January. Moved to April, moved back to January, moved back to April, moved

499
00:38:17,700 --> 00:38:21,700
back to January, and now it's in April. It's like they can't figure out when they want

500
00:38:21,700 --> 00:38:26,520
to release a stupid game. But as a perfect example, usually Konami though, they don't

501
00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:30,880
shift their dates around that much. It's usually a couple, and then once it gets closer to

502
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:35,200
it, it's set in stone. EA, on the other hand, they like shifting their dates all over the

503
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:36,200
damn place.

504
00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:37,200
Q. How about Square?

505
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:43,440
A. Square? Not so much. But not many Square games come out. I mean, we've had two in the

506
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:44,440
last four months.

507
00:38:44,440 --> 00:38:47,720
Q. Well, a question from the chat room. Advent Children, what's the status on that? You know

508
00:38:47,720 --> 00:38:49,040
when that's slated to come out now?

509
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:50,300
A. That's 2B now still.

510
00:38:50,300 --> 00:38:51,300
Q. Really?

511
00:38:51,300 --> 00:39:00,420
It was going to be in February, then it was actually slated for the end of January, and

512
00:39:00,420 --> 00:39:06,460
then now we have it as moratorium in our system, meaning that we don't have a date yet when

513
00:39:06,460 --> 00:39:07,460
it's coming out.

514
00:39:07,460 --> 00:39:08,460
Why are they doing that?

515
00:39:08,460 --> 00:39:11,340
That's so crazy, because people are pirating this movie like, maybe that's why they're

516
00:39:11,340 --> 00:39:14,140
doing it, because of the piracy they're going to have to go back and add all these extras

517
00:39:14,140 --> 00:39:15,540
that people are going to want to buy the DVD for.

518
00:39:15,540 --> 00:39:19,180
I'm thinking they're probably trying to, because people have bitched and moaned about the fact

519
00:39:19,180 --> 00:39:25,180
Did they all have good box sets over here or anything like that? I didn't talk to the Sony guy. I always yell at him every time he comes in.

520
00:39:25,180 --> 00:39:36,180
He used to have our Sony reps sit about four cubes down from me. So whenever the Sony people would come from Sony Pictures or whatever, I'd yell at them for not releasing Advent Children.

521
00:39:36,180 --> 00:39:47,180
And, you know, I knew more about it than they did. And, you know, I was like, why aren't you releasing the box sets here? And they're like, oh, I don't know.

522
00:39:47,180 --> 00:39:51,180
I'm sure that one guy who comes to your company makes all the calls on what they're going to be releasing.

523
00:39:51,180 --> 00:39:58,180
Well, a lot of the people that come to our company are senior sales or whatever, so they do have somewhat of a say.

524
00:39:58,180 --> 00:40:03,180
But, you know, they... I don't know. I don't know when it's coming out.

525
00:40:03,180 --> 00:40:08,180
All I know is I've seen it. It's cool. Hopefully, it'll be coming out.

526
00:40:08,180 --> 00:40:14,180
But, I don't know. I always keep the website updated. I post when it changes.

527
00:40:14,180 --> 00:40:19,220
Another comment from our chatroom, from Ron Chan, chatroom by the way, orange-on-a-show-you.com,

528
00:40:19,220 --> 00:40:24,500
click on chat, rumors are leaking out about theatrical release. That's kind of true, this

529
00:40:24,500 --> 00:40:28,260
has been something that's kind of been circulating for a while now. We mentioned this on a podcast

530
00:40:28,260 --> 00:40:31,600
like months ago, because I don't even remember why I picked up this bug. Now, I want to say

531
00:40:31,600 --> 00:40:36,980
it was sometime around E3, I picked up a bug, no, it was later than E3. I remember, it was

532
00:40:36,980 --> 00:40:41,220
a friend of a friend kind of thing, so take it with a grain of salt, but it was going

533
00:40:41,220 --> 00:40:46,240
to be released in IMAX, that they really want to do an IMAX release for the movie, which

534
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:50,800
would kick ass. Don't get me wrong, it would be great. And probably Final Fantasy Advent

535
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:54,400
Children and IMAX would do better business than the last movie did here is all. Okay,

536
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:55,400
maybe not.

537
00:40:55,400 --> 00:40:59,980
Yeah, they have Polar Express running right now in IMAX, but I think it needs to be in

538
00:40:59,980 --> 00:41:03,980
IMAX. I mean, that would be awesome if it was in IMAX. Who knows? And if that's the

539
00:41:03,980 --> 00:41:10,100
case, it's going to take a long time to print digital to the IMAX film store.

540
00:41:10,100 --> 00:41:15,100
Since the movie's all digital as it is, it won't take that long to enhance, so to speak, for the movie.

541
00:41:15,100 --> 00:41:16,100
Not really.

542
00:41:20,100 --> 00:41:21,100
Let's go to break.

543
00:41:21,100 --> 00:41:25,100
When we come back from this break, we're going to open up the Skypline, for sure we'll do that.

544
00:41:25,100 --> 00:41:27,100
And also I want to talk a little more about Xbox 360.

545
00:41:27,100 --> 00:41:30,100
This is kind of the launch week for 360.

546
00:41:30,100 --> 00:41:32,100
And I want to talk about 10 style at some point.

547
00:41:32,100 --> 00:41:35,100
And I want to talk about other news going on in the Bomani world, because we have a little bit.

548
00:41:35,100 --> 00:41:37,100
So we will be back after this.

549
00:41:37,100 --> 00:41:40,100
Just some Bimani potpourri this break, no real theme.

550
00:41:40,100 --> 00:41:47,100
And we'll be back with more Orange Lounge Radio after this.

551
00:42:10,100 --> 00:42:14,100
Showing me the way I've forgotten

552
00:42:14,100 --> 00:42:17,100
I've gone too far in confusion

553
00:42:17,100 --> 00:42:21,100
I've been lost

554
00:42:21,100 --> 00:42:24,100
It may take some time

555
00:42:24,100 --> 00:42:27,100
But somehow I only get

556
00:42:27,100 --> 00:42:31,100
To my destination

557
00:42:31,100 --> 00:42:34,100
Now I'm leaving it all behind

558
00:42:34,100 --> 00:42:38,100
I don't know what it is I expect to find

559
00:42:38,100 --> 00:42:42,100
But I'll always want you here by my side

560
00:42:44,100 --> 00:42:47,100
Now I'm leaving you so behind

561
00:42:47,100 --> 00:42:50,100
I don't know what it is I expect

562
00:42:50,100 --> 00:42:55,100
To find but I'll always want you here by my side

563
00:42:56,100 --> 00:42:58,100
Ciao with me

564
00:42:59,100 --> 00:43:01,100
Ciao with me

565
00:43:01,100 --> 00:43:11,100
You come with me now You come with me now

566
00:43:31,100 --> 00:43:35,100
Yeah, yeah, yeah

567
00:43:35,100 --> 00:43:39,100
Yeah, yeah, yeah

568
00:43:39,100 --> 00:43:43,100
Yeah, yeah, yeah

569
00:43:53,100 --> 00:43:55,100
We're headed for pre-med

570
00:43:55,100 --> 00:43:59,100
Until we stand tall

571
00:43:59,100 --> 00:44:04,100
Maybe they see them, and welcome us all

572
00:44:05,100 --> 00:44:10,100
So many like you to go, and things to be found

573
00:44:11,100 --> 00:44:14,100
I'm still not alone, it turns out

574
00:44:15,100 --> 00:44:17,100
Final Countdown

575
00:44:21,100 --> 00:44:23,100
Final Countdown

576
00:44:23,100 --> 00:44:30,100
I don't count down

577
00:44:30,100 --> 00:44:35,100
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

578
00:45:30,100 --> 00:45:30,600
So

579
00:45:54,600 --> 00:45:56,600
Postcards live forever

580
00:45:56,740 --> 00:45:58,360
The crane glass blows and

581
00:45:58,360 --> 00:45:58,800
the wind

582
00:45:58,800 --> 00:46:07,800
It would be a much better fight with you, with me

583
00:46:07,800 --> 00:46:13,800
If you hadn't met me, I'd be fine on my own baby

584
00:46:13,800 --> 00:46:19,800
Never felt so lonely then you came along

585
00:46:19,800 --> 00:46:22,800
So now what should I do?

586
00:46:22,800 --> 00:46:26,800
I'm strung out, addicted to you

587
00:46:26,800 --> 00:46:30,300
My body aches now that you've gone

588
00:46:30,300 --> 00:46:34,800
My supplies fell through

589
00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:39,800
You glad you gave me everything you had and more

590
00:46:39,800 --> 00:46:42,300
You craved my happiness

591
00:46:42,300 --> 00:46:45,800
When you made me feel torn in each smile

592
00:46:45,800 --> 00:46:48,800
But now I feel your stress

593
00:46:48,800 --> 00:46:53,800
Love was never meant to be such a crazy affair, no

594
00:46:53,800 --> 00:47:01,800
And who was I? But you never thought I'd sit around and crumble your love

595
00:47:31,800 --> 00:47:35,800
The

596
00:47:35,800 --> 00:47:39,800
the

597
00:47:39,800 --> 00:47:43,800
the

598
00:47:43,800 --> 00:47:47,800
the

599
00:47:47,800 --> 00:47:51,800
the

600
00:47:51,800 --> 00:47:55,800
the

601
00:47:55,800 --> 00:47:59,800
the

602
00:48:29,800 --> 00:48:39,800
Orange Lounge Radio, Bahmani Music, and more.

603
00:48:39,800 --> 00:48:40,800
Perfect!

604
00:48:40,800 --> 00:48:45,560
We're back here on Orange Lounge Radio and that break you heard, uh, Come With Me from

605
00:48:45,560 --> 00:48:49,960
UltraMix 3, Final Countdown from 2DX4 Style, You're Not Here from Silent Hill, and then

606
00:48:49,960 --> 00:48:54,600
it was in, uh, DDR Extreme as well, and from Keyboard Mania 2nd Mix, Akumajo Dracula Medley,

607
00:48:54,600 --> 00:48:57,400
which is also now in DDR UltraMix 3 as well.

608
00:48:57,400 --> 00:49:00,160
By the way, speaking of Castlevania songs and Bahmani, I don't know if you saw that

609
00:49:00,160 --> 00:49:04,440
early song list for Beatmania Distorted, is what they're calling it.

610
00:49:04,440 --> 00:49:06,420
I still want to call it 13th style.

611
00:49:06,420 --> 00:49:10,580
I know that's a taboo thing to do, is that no, it's not 13th style, it's Distorted.

612
00:49:10,580 --> 00:49:15,780
But it does have 13 in the title this time, so I'm going to call it 13th style, until

613
00:49:15,780 --> 00:49:16,780
I get yelled at.

614
00:49:16,780 --> 00:49:20,500
But no, it's supposed to have Bloody Tears in it, like a remix of Bloody Tears.

615
00:49:20,500 --> 00:49:27,020
That is going to be badass, because Bloody Tears was that song from Castlevania II, and

616
00:49:27,020 --> 00:49:31,900
I can't even, I think part of it is in there, in that song, so it's going to be very awesome.

617
00:49:31,900 --> 00:49:32,900
I can't wait for this.

618
00:49:32,900 --> 00:49:34,540
What is this that you just pulled up there?

619
00:49:34,540 --> 00:49:35,540
Ooh!

620
00:49:35,540 --> 00:49:36,660
Ragnarok Online 2?

621
00:49:36,660 --> 00:49:38,260
That's Ragnarok Online 2 preview?

622
00:49:38,260 --> 00:49:40,660
Will you post that in our chat room so our folks can go?

623
00:49:40,660 --> 00:49:41,660
That looks pretty fun.

624
00:49:41,660 --> 00:49:45,940
Yeah, one of our podcast listeners, Daskay, wrote it to me.

625
00:49:45,940 --> 00:49:46,940
Very cool.

626
00:49:46,940 --> 00:49:47,940
We're going to have a really fun podcast as well.

627
00:49:47,940 --> 00:49:48,940
We're going to post that in the chat room.

628
00:49:48,940 --> 00:49:49,940
Ooh, that looks pretty.

629
00:49:49,940 --> 00:49:50,940
Yeah.

630
00:49:50,940 --> 00:49:54,700
This means that James is going to be quitting World of Warcraft awfully soon.

631
00:49:54,700 --> 00:49:56,700
It's very fluid.

632
00:49:56,700 --> 00:50:02,700
It's got a 3D fluid sense to it, where you're not, you know, warping into fights or anything.

633
00:50:02,700 --> 00:50:05,700
Kind of reminds me of the Final Fantasy XII demo, I must say, actually.

634
00:50:05,700 --> 00:50:10,700
A little bit, a little bit, except you're by yourself, but of course that would be to be expected in an MMO.

635
00:50:10,700 --> 00:50:12,700
That's Ragnarok 2. Interesting.

636
00:50:12,700 --> 00:50:15,700
And there's your customizing for your character outfits.

637
00:50:15,700 --> 00:50:19,700
Our chat room is yelling now for a link, so you better link them up.

638
00:50:19,700 --> 00:50:21,700
Throw in the whole door, sis!

639
00:50:21,700 --> 00:50:26,700
Alright, uh, Loki, you had some interesting observations on eBay?

640
00:50:26,700 --> 00:50:34,700
Well, yeah, I was just looking at the, uh, cause there was, uh, checking on there was this BeatMania, uh, final machine that was on sale for $99, um, before.

641
00:50:34,700 --> 00:50:42,700
But, I looked at the guy that was selling, he's selling some other Bemani stuff, um, Keyboard Mania, uh, third, uh, $280.

642
00:50:42,700 --> 00:50:46,700
Holy fuck, I want that. Oh my god, I don't know where I would put that in this little apartment.

643
00:50:46,700 --> 00:50:49,700
City of Industry is where it's at if you want to pick it up.

644
00:50:49,700 --> 00:50:50,700
Does that mean it's AI selling it? Cause AI's in there.

645
00:50:50,700 --> 00:50:56,700
I don't think it's AI, but they're selling Dance Maniac's second mix.

646
00:50:56,700 --> 00:50:58,700
Hold on, what, Jamie? What?

647
00:50:58,700 --> 00:51:02,700
It had no buy it now on it, and it had many days left on the bed when I looked at it.

648
00:51:02,700 --> 00:51:04,700
Mm.

649
00:51:04,700 --> 00:51:06,700
Okay.

650
00:51:06,700 --> 00:51:08,700
I'm sorry, go ahead, Lucky.

651
00:51:08,700 --> 00:51:14,700
They have a 2DX Red machine for $5,100.

652
00:51:14,700 --> 00:51:19,700
BeatMania, the final right now is only $152.50, but they have a bunch of stuff.

653
00:51:19,700 --> 00:51:27,700
Initial D3, they have a Wang Dan Midnight Maximum Tune 2 racing machine for only $2,500.

654
00:51:27,700 --> 00:51:39,700
Just a bunch of kick-ass stuff. DrumMania 5th, GuitarFreaks 5th, Dance Maniac 2nd, Extreme, and Boxing Mania.

655
00:51:39,700 --> 00:51:44,700
Wow, that's pretty cool. I wonder if that's AI unloading all that stuff, because you know Arcade and Fitbit.

656
00:51:44,700 --> 00:51:47,700
And they're in City of Industry, or at least they're right next to it.

657
00:51:47,700 --> 00:51:49,700
Yeah, they all have a fifth mix, so...

658
00:51:49,700 --> 00:51:51,700
They did, though. They did at one point.

659
00:51:51,700 --> 00:51:53,700
Well, it's probably upgraded, though.

660
00:51:53,700 --> 00:51:59,700
I kinda want that keyboard mania machine. I don't know why I'm so into keyboard mania, but I am.

661
00:51:59,700 --> 00:52:01,700
I really want it.

662
00:52:01,700 --> 00:52:03,700
If I had a house, I'd be getting something.

663
00:52:03,700 --> 00:52:05,700
I don't even have a house and I want it.

664
00:52:05,700 --> 00:52:07,700
The neighbors would kill- you know we have new neighbors now.

665
00:52:07,700 --> 00:52:09,700
We just, uh, got some books moving in finally.

666
00:52:09,700 --> 00:52:12,700
Just think of one thing, Rob. How the fuck are you gonna get that upstairs?

667
00:52:12,700 --> 00:52:15,700
I don't care. I'll get- I'll get five guys over here to lift it.

668
00:52:15,700 --> 00:52:17,700
We'll find a way.

669
00:52:17,700 --> 00:52:19,700
We'll get a dolly.

670
00:52:19,700 --> 00:52:22,700
I'd say rip that shit apart, but yeah.

671
00:52:22,700 --> 00:52:25,700
No, I'm not really gonna buy it. I can't. I can't afford it.

672
00:52:25,700 --> 00:52:27,700
Maybe next year. We'll see.

673
00:52:27,700 --> 00:52:28,700
There's always stuff for sale.

674
00:52:28,700 --> 00:52:31,700
Speaking of next year, it looks highly, highly probable I'm going to be at, uh-

675
00:52:31,700 --> 00:52:36,260
Now, I haven't signed on the line and everything, but it was very, very probable, and I know

676
00:52:36,260 --> 00:52:41,140
we have a lot of listeners on the East Coast who have asked me to hang out with them, and

677
00:52:41,140 --> 00:52:42,140
I actually did.

678
00:52:42,140 --> 00:52:45,980
When I went to Pennsylvania last time I was out there, I actually hung out with a couple

679
00:52:45,980 --> 00:52:46,980
of listeners.

680
00:52:46,980 --> 00:52:47,980
It was cool.

681
00:52:47,980 --> 00:52:48,980
It was a good time.

682
00:52:48,980 --> 00:52:51,900
So I'm down for that again, and the time and place to be at is Katsucon, which is going

683
00:52:51,900 --> 00:52:52,900
to be in February.

684
00:52:52,900 --> 00:52:55,280
I believe it's the 17th through 19th.

685
00:52:55,280 --> 00:52:59,780
Don't quote me on that, but it's around there in D.C., and it's looking very, very likely

686
00:52:59,780 --> 00:53:03,300
I'm going to be there and possibly doing a panel, which will be a lot of fun.

687
00:53:03,300 --> 00:53:06,540
That would be fun. So I will let you know absolutely for sure

688
00:53:06,540 --> 00:53:10,820
the details as soon as I know, and I've bought my plane tickets and everything, but it does

689
00:53:10,820 --> 00:53:13,640
look very likely I'm going to be there. So I'm pretty excited.

690
00:53:13,640 --> 00:53:16,820
I haven't been to D.C. in a long time. The only thing I'm kind of freaked out about

691
00:53:16,820 --> 00:53:20,900
is that in February it might be snowing, right? Don't they get snow?

692
00:53:20,900 --> 00:53:24,900
Yeah. This is the California side of me. Even though

693
00:53:24,900 --> 00:53:27,740
it does snow in some parts of California, I don't live in one of those parts, so I'm

694
00:53:27,740 --> 00:53:30,740
I'm so ignorant when it comes to snow.

695
00:53:30,740 --> 00:53:32,740
I don't know. I've never been to DC.

696
00:53:32,740 --> 00:53:35,740
I have before. It's fun.

697
00:53:35,740 --> 00:53:38,740
Alright.

698
00:53:38,740 --> 00:53:40,740
Uh, anyway.

699
00:53:40,740 --> 00:53:45,740
Uh, moving on. We were going to do Extraverse movie review, but the room cleared out.

700
00:53:45,740 --> 00:53:48,740
Did somebody fart or something? Because the room just cleared out.

701
00:53:48,740 --> 00:53:49,740
His phone rang.

702
00:53:49,740 --> 00:53:51,740
Megalotov ran out. Extraverse phone rang.

703
00:53:51,740 --> 00:53:53,740
Megalotov's trying to pack his bags because they're leaving soon.

704
00:53:53,740 --> 00:54:05,660
I had to go to the restroom. So, gosh. Anyway. Let's see, what else, what else, what else?

705
00:54:05,660 --> 00:54:10,740
I guess let's talk about the 360 for a little bit. Some of the horror stories, did you hear

706
00:54:10,740 --> 00:54:16,140
about some of the horror stories when it came to the 360? About like the Walmart that had

707
00:54:16,140 --> 00:54:20,020
the riot somewhere in Pennsylvania, and there was an EB Games that got robbed.

708
00:54:20,020 --> 00:54:28,020
I heard there were some funny ones. There was one where there was a big line out in front of this Wal-Mart, I think it was, or Wal-Mart or Target, something like that.

709
00:54:29,020 --> 00:54:41,020
So a big line of people, and they had one cop sitting there making sure nothing was going wrong. Then this National Guardsman comes up, and it's like, holy shit, he's getting everything in order.

710
00:54:41,020 --> 00:54:46,520
You know, immediately stands in the front of the line, gets a ticket to buy an Xbox 360, and is like,

711
00:54:46,520 --> 00:54:49,020
FEND FOR YOURSELVES! And leaves.

712
00:54:50,020 --> 00:54:52,520
What? That's crazy.

713
00:54:53,020 --> 00:54:56,520
That's funny, is what that is. I'd be pissed.

714
00:54:56,520 --> 00:55:00,520
I want to let Extrovert do his thing. We'll go back to the 360 in a little bit, but Extrovert's back in the room.

715
00:55:00,520 --> 00:55:03,020
Do you have an important phone call you had to take?

716
00:55:03,020 --> 00:55:05,020
I did have an important very important call.

717
00:55:05,020 --> 00:55:06,020
Was it a hookup call?

718
00:55:06,020 --> 00:55:08,020
It was definitely not a hookup call.

719
00:55:08,020 --> 00:55:08,520
Booty call?

720
00:55:08,520 --> 00:55:09,020
No.

721
00:55:09,020 --> 00:55:10,020
No.

722
00:55:10,020 --> 00:55:11,020
Okay.

723
00:55:11,020 --> 00:55:12,020
Was the family call?

724
00:55:12,020 --> 00:55:13,020
Is everything okay?

725
00:55:13,020 --> 00:55:14,020
No.

726
00:55:14,020 --> 00:55:15,020
Everything's fine.

727
00:55:15,020 --> 00:55:16,020
You seem kind of bummed out tonight.

728
00:55:16,020 --> 00:55:17,020
I know.

729
00:55:17,020 --> 00:55:18,020
Is everything okay?

730
00:55:18,020 --> 00:55:19,020
I'm just like tired.

731
00:55:19,020 --> 00:55:20,020
Do you need a hug?

732
00:55:20,020 --> 00:55:21,020
No.

733
00:55:21,020 --> 00:55:22,020
Don't touch me.

734
00:55:22,020 --> 00:55:23,020
Alright.

735
00:55:23,020 --> 00:55:24,020
I won't.

736
00:55:24,020 --> 00:55:25,020
I'm kidding.

737
00:55:25,020 --> 00:55:26,020
How was your week?

738
00:55:26,020 --> 00:55:27,020
How was your week, Extrover?

739
00:55:27,020 --> 00:55:28,020
My week was fine.

740
00:55:28,020 --> 00:55:30,220
It was like Thanksgiving and stuff.

741
00:55:30,220 --> 00:55:37,460
Saw my family and went and saw Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire again.

742
00:55:37,460 --> 00:55:41,000
did a lot better than the first time that I saw it.

743
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:42,520
I need to go see that again.

744
00:55:42,520 --> 00:55:43,520
Yay.

745
00:55:43,520 --> 00:55:45,560
Are you going to see that four times in the theater like better?

746
00:55:45,560 --> 00:55:46,560
I can.

747
00:55:46,560 --> 00:55:52,060
Oh, and it's the fourth movie, so you'll see it four times in the theater.

748
00:55:52,060 --> 00:55:53,060
Get it?

749
00:55:53,060 --> 00:55:54,060
Get it?

750
00:55:54,060 --> 00:55:55,060
That's really retarded.

751
00:55:55,060 --> 00:55:56,060
Don't say that again.

752
00:55:56,060 --> 00:55:57,060
All right.

753
00:55:57,060 --> 00:56:00,220
Well, I know you got to get going soon because you and Mickey have to get on the road, but

754
00:56:00,220 --> 00:56:02,400
I wanted to allow you a chance to do your movie review.

755
00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:05,560
Now, I know you hate your old theme music, so I changed your theme music.

756
00:56:05,560 --> 00:56:06,560
Okay?

757
00:56:06,560 --> 00:56:10,560
So, what movie are you going to be reviewing today?

758
00:56:10,560 --> 00:56:12,560
I am going to be...

759
00:56:12,560 --> 00:56:13,560
What is that?

760
00:56:13,560 --> 00:56:14,560
Just do your talking.

761
00:56:14,560 --> 00:56:16,560
Don't worry about what's going on behind you.

762
00:56:16,560 --> 00:56:22,560
I'm going to be reviewing Rent because I went and saw it yesterday with all you folks.

763
00:56:22,560 --> 00:56:34,560
And basically it's a movie about late 80s people trying to make it in New York

764
00:56:34,560 --> 00:56:38,560
And I'm having problems financially and dying of AIDS.

765
00:56:39,560 --> 00:56:44,560
Pretty much like you said yesterday, if you don't get a job, then you'll die of AIDS.

766
00:56:44,560 --> 00:56:48,560
That was my summary of the moral I learned from Rance, is that if you don't get a job, you'll die of AIDS.

767
00:56:48,560 --> 00:56:50,560
Right. Rob didn't really like it that much.

768
00:56:50,560 --> 00:56:52,560
I hated Rance. I hated it a lot.

769
00:56:52,560 --> 00:56:55,560
I liked it. I liked it quite a bit.

770
00:56:55,560 --> 00:57:00,560
And I think that it's maybe because I really just am into musicals. I love them.

771
00:57:00,560 --> 00:57:07,560
I liked the music in them. It was poignant. It had some really good moments in it.

772
00:57:07,560 --> 00:57:10,560
Is that because you're gay? No way. I'm gay and I didn't like it.

773
00:57:10,560 --> 00:57:15,560
No. I don't think that liking musicals is a gay or straight thing.

774
00:57:15,560 --> 00:57:20,560
You can be a musical lover.

775
00:57:20,560 --> 00:57:22,560
That's right. My mom's straight and she loves musicals.

776
00:57:22,560 --> 00:57:25,560
Right. Bad example, Rob.

777
00:57:25,560 --> 00:57:28,560
I like musicals.

778
00:57:28,560 --> 00:57:29,560
They're very fun.

779
00:57:29,560 --> 00:57:31,560
I like musicals, I just don't like rent.

780
00:57:31,560 --> 00:57:33,560
I know, as I heard.

781
00:57:33,560 --> 00:57:35,560
Many a time.

782
00:57:35,560 --> 00:57:39,560
No, it was good though. I liked it, I really enjoyed it.

783
00:57:39,560 --> 00:57:42,560
And there you go.

784
00:57:42,560 --> 00:57:44,560
So two thumbs up?

785
00:57:44,560 --> 00:57:47,560
Two cocks up and a limp cock.

786
00:57:47,560 --> 00:57:50,560
Use protection, or you might catch something.

787
00:57:50,560 --> 00:57:52,560
Oh, right.

788
00:57:52,560 --> 00:57:54,560
Or else your cocks will die of AIDS.

789
00:57:54,560 --> 00:57:55,560
Alright.

790
00:57:55,560 --> 00:57:57,560
And make sure your cocks get a job.

791
00:57:57,560 --> 00:58:01,560
Please get a job. A low job. Okay, I'm off.

792
00:58:01,560 --> 00:58:05,560
Be careful not to sell out to the man. Yeah, don't do that.

793
00:58:05,560 --> 00:58:09,560
Don't sell out to the man. Final thoughts?

794
00:58:09,560 --> 00:58:13,560
Go see Rent. No, don't. You may like it, or you may not.

795
00:58:13,560 --> 00:58:17,560
Alright. Get, get, uh,

796
00:58:17,560 --> 00:58:21,560
X-er, X-er, get, uh, Miklota back in here so that he can say his goodbyes, too,

797
00:58:21,560 --> 00:58:25,560
because I know you guys are leaving soon. Oh, Miklota!

798
00:58:25,560 --> 00:58:31,620
there? Somewhere? Live radio, kids. We're not in an actual studio, by the way. This

799
00:58:31,620 --> 00:58:37,720
is the spare bedroom in the apartment that Extrovert and I live in. It's quite a nifty

800
00:58:37,720 --> 00:58:44,340
apartment. Alright, give that mic back to Loki. Alright. Back to the 360. Yeah. What's

801
00:58:44,340 --> 00:58:48,880
the status on your 360 now? You pre-ordered your 360 back in, remind me when this was,

802
00:58:48,880 --> 00:58:54,640
like June? August. August. And still no dice. No dice. I'm on the first page halfway down,

803
00:58:54,640 --> 00:59:01,040
about. They said, though, that I will probably get mine before Christmas. And I'm guessing

804
00:59:01,040 --> 00:59:05,760
they're saying, someone said in the chatroom that 14 units are going to each store each

805
00:59:05,760 --> 00:59:09,080
week or whatever, so if that's the case, I'll probably get mine probably in two weeks.

806
00:59:09,080 --> 00:59:14,960
Or why would 14 go to the Ma and Pa shop and bump-fuck, you know, North Dakota, but then

807
00:59:14,960 --> 00:59:17,720
14 go to Best Buy? I think they're talking about like, TV games and stuff. Okay, well

808
00:59:17,720 --> 00:59:22,880
that's... I don't think, no one knows until they get the stupid shipments in, so... Do

809
00:59:22,880 --> 00:59:25,880
Do we know anything about future shipments of Xbox 360s? Because that's why I think it's interesting.

810
00:59:25,880 --> 00:59:30,880
It is official that they will be shipping every week to replenish retailers.

811
00:59:30,880 --> 00:59:40,880
So all those fucking people out there that are worried and bidding on stupid auctions that are going for 3,000 plus dollars for these stupid 360s

812
00:59:40,880 --> 00:59:43,880
do not need to be doing that because they're going to be in stores.

813
00:59:43,880 --> 00:59:47,880
There is no shortage, as I've been saying from the get-go, big deal.

814
00:59:47,880 --> 00:59:55,880
They sold out so that their drive-up hype, they did that. Why would you drive up hype if you're not going to replenish the market? So it only makes sense.

815
00:59:55,880 --> 01:00:04,880
You know, I have an interesting story to share real quick. I know you got to get going soon, so I want to give you a chance to say your final thought and any other things you want to say to the listeners.

816
01:00:04,880 --> 01:00:06,880
Brokeback Mountain is the best thing ever.

817
01:00:06,880 --> 01:00:07,880
Bearback Mountain?

818
01:00:07,880 --> 01:00:10,880
Yeah, Bearback Mountain. It totally is if you read the book.

819
01:00:10,880 --> 01:00:14,880
The book's only like 49 pages, so you can totally read it.

820
01:00:14,880 --> 01:00:19,780
It's only like $10, go buy the soundtrack, go see the movie if you can.

821
01:00:19,780 --> 01:00:29,580
If you like the notion of people butt-fucking and spitting on their cocks and having that

822
01:00:29,580 --> 01:00:34,760
as a lubricant, then go see Bareback Mountain.

823
01:00:34,760 --> 01:00:38,580
You know this is like an Oscar caliber film they're trying to put this out as, and you're

824
01:00:38,580 --> 01:00:42,860
turning it into a porno.

825
01:00:42,860 --> 01:00:46,860
Not to be confused with the one we watched last night, The Hornet Store.

826
01:00:46,860 --> 01:00:48,860
Anyway, look, let's just move on.

827
01:00:48,860 --> 01:00:49,860
Let's just move on.

828
01:00:49,860 --> 01:00:50,860
All right.

829
01:00:50,860 --> 01:00:51,860
Thank you guys for coming.

830
01:00:51,860 --> 01:00:52,860
Have a lovely...

831
01:00:52,860 --> 01:00:53,860
Have a safe drive back.

832
01:00:53,860 --> 01:00:54,860
Drive safe.

833
01:00:54,860 --> 01:00:55,860
Extra firm.

834
01:00:55,860 --> 01:00:56,860
Drive safe.

835
01:00:56,860 --> 01:00:57,860
And don't...

836
01:00:57,860 --> 01:00:58,860
No drinking.

837
01:00:58,860 --> 01:00:59,860
At the wheel this time.

838
01:00:59,860 --> 01:01:00,860
All right.

839
01:01:00,860 --> 01:01:01,860
Okay.

840
01:01:01,860 --> 01:01:03,380
I had a friend on LiveJournal.

841
01:01:03,380 --> 01:01:06,940
And I know this person doesn't listen to the show, so I'm okay to talk about this.

842
01:01:06,940 --> 01:01:10,060
And it's behind a friend's lock post anyway, so none of you would know who it is.

843
01:01:10,060 --> 01:01:12,020
And I told him I don't know how I feel about this.

844
01:01:12,020 --> 01:01:15,860
This is somebody, he's not a gamer in any capacity, I mean I think he's like a casual

845
01:01:15,860 --> 01:01:19,940
thing. You know how like most people our age have probably played Mario Brothers once in

846
01:01:19,940 --> 01:01:25,180
their life, you know that's about it, but not, by no means a hardcore gamer. He rounded

847
01:01:25,180 --> 01:01:29,220
up a team of individuals, they got I think eight people or something, and they managed

848
01:01:29,220 --> 01:01:34,260
to get nine platinum Xbox systems on launch day, because they all camped out at least

849
01:01:34,260 --> 01:01:40,560
24 hours in advance. So they all got nine platinum Xboxes. They sold all the systems

850
01:01:40,560 --> 01:01:47,920
on eBay, and they gave each person that stood out in line and helped them out $1,000 for

851
01:01:47,920 --> 01:01:51,080
their help, and they were very happy for $1,000 for their help.

852
01:01:51,080 --> 01:01:57,160
And they still had, after that, had left over, I think, something like $8,000 that they put

853
01:01:57,160 --> 01:02:01,520
$5,000 away for the baby's education because they have a new baby on the way, and the other

854
01:02:01,520 --> 01:02:04,000
$3,000 they just spent on themselves.

855
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:06,640
And I told them, you know, I don't know what I think about this.

856
01:02:06,640 --> 01:02:09,760
I replied to this, I don't know what I think about this because I think you're taking advantage

857
01:02:09,760 --> 01:02:15,440
of people, but at the same time, you know, I blame the people that actually bid that

858
01:02:15,440 --> 01:02:22,400
much on eBay and allow you to think that this is a viable option for making money, you know,

859
01:02:22,400 --> 01:02:25,880
and I'm happy that as kids, because they're gonna invest the money, and I know they will,

860
01:02:25,880 --> 01:02:28,440
I know they will be smart with their money and invest the money, and they will be able

861
01:02:28,440 --> 01:02:34,160
to send this baby to a really great school, all based off of these Xbox 360 sales.

862
01:02:34,160 --> 01:02:37,280
But as a gamer, I can't help but thank you, bastard.

863
01:02:37,280 --> 01:02:38,480
I wanted one of those.

864
01:02:38,480 --> 01:02:42,980
They're taking advantage on the desperation and relative stupidity of other people.

865
01:02:42,980 --> 01:02:44,980
But who's to blame in that scenario?

866
01:02:44,980 --> 01:02:45,980
I don't know.

867
01:02:45,980 --> 01:02:47,980
They were well within their rights.

868
01:02:47,980 --> 01:02:50,980
I think, you know, it's hard for me to put the blame on them.

869
01:02:50,980 --> 01:02:51,980
I think they are within their rights.

870
01:02:51,980 --> 01:02:52,980
They are smart.

871
01:02:52,980 --> 01:02:53,980
They put the work into it.

872
01:02:53,980 --> 01:02:57,980
They put it online knowing that there were gonna be morons out there who'd bid on them.

873
01:02:57,980 --> 01:02:58,980
I know.

874
01:02:58,980 --> 01:02:59,980
It's just...

875
01:02:59,980 --> 01:03:00,980
I don't know.

876
01:03:00,980 --> 01:03:01,980
It gets my attention.

877
01:03:01,980 --> 01:03:03,980
I believe the idiot masses should be exploited.

878
01:03:03,980 --> 01:03:07,980
I just can't believe somebody would pay like $3,000 and they got it.

879
01:03:07,980 --> 01:03:12,980
They got it. They got like $3100 for each of these systems. It was crazy.

880
01:03:12,980 --> 01:03:14,980
Crazy, crazy.

881
01:03:14,980 --> 01:03:18,980
What can I say? People are dumb. But, you know, like I said, I'm just waiting.

882
01:03:18,980 --> 01:03:24,980
But if I do find one in a store, you know, if Best Buy is getting, you know, 90 in each shipment or whatever,

883
01:03:24,980 --> 01:03:29,980
and there's some sitting there, of course I'm going to buy one, because, you know, I can have it now,

884
01:03:29,980 --> 01:03:40,940
and I can get my money back from my deposit on it, and whatever. It's no big deal. Really,

885
01:03:40,940 --> 01:03:45,820
when I looked at the games and the four games that I got for it, I looked at, once I got

886
01:03:45,820 --> 01:03:50,020
those four games, I still have like $70 in store credit. I'm like, what do I buy now?

887
01:03:50,020 --> 01:03:53,460
And I looked at the list of everything that's coming out. I'm like, I don't want any of

888
01:03:53,460 --> 01:03:55,700
this. And that's kind of what it is.

889
01:03:55,700 --> 01:03:59,380
That's what's scaring me away from buying an Xbox 360 right now, is I really don't feel

890
01:03:59,380 --> 01:04:03,380
like I think it's going to be the same thing with regular Xbox I had no reason

891
01:04:03,380 --> 01:04:10,060
to buy a regular Xbox until halo really and even halo I wasn't a fan of halo

892
01:04:10,060 --> 01:04:14,060
when I first played it but I converted I it's a first-person shooter I enjoy yes

893
01:04:14,060 --> 01:04:19,140
you need to see perfect dark zero I do want to see Xbox 360 maybe it's all

894
01:04:19,140 --> 01:04:23,100
about perfect dark zero okay well I need to be talking to you as an Xbox 360

895
01:04:23,100 --> 01:04:27,820
owner which you you and the hubby got one of these systems all right okay we

896
01:04:27,820 --> 01:04:31,760
didn't. Oh, I thought, I thought. I told you we decided not to. I know, but then I thought you went back and you

897
01:04:31,760 --> 01:04:36,500
did. Yeah, we went and played somebody else's. Oh. And now we're gonna get one next week. Okay.

898
01:04:36,500 --> 01:04:41,180
Because we are gonna get one next week. Gotcha. Okay, now I make sense. Okay, so you didn't

899
01:04:41,180 --> 01:04:43,460
end up getting one, but you played somebody else's, so what'd you think? I

900
01:04:43,460 --> 01:04:46,620
haven't, I've only played the demo kiosk. I haven't played an actual system yet.

901
01:04:46,620 --> 01:04:51,640
There's a point where games can be too pretty, and Project Gotham 3 is too

902
01:04:51,640 --> 01:04:55,540
pretty. The cars look like they float over the ground. However, you do actually

903
01:04:55,540 --> 01:05:01,860
start off with performance vehicles as opposed to just eye candy, like one of your first

904
01:05:01,860 --> 01:05:10,860
cars you can pick from is the Saleen Mustang, or the new Shelby, which actually isn't even

905
01:05:10,860 --> 01:05:13,260
going to be out on the market to purchase until next year.

906
01:05:13,260 --> 01:05:17,140
Now did you play this on like a widescreen HD type setup?

907
01:05:17,140 --> 01:05:20,140
We played it on an HD TV, but nowhere near as huge as mine.

908
01:05:20,140 --> 01:05:21,620
But still, I bet it was very pretty.

909
01:05:21,620 --> 01:05:23,500
It was pretty, but it was too pretty.

910
01:05:23,500 --> 01:05:26,500
I mean, like I said, the chorus looked like they were floating over the ground.

911
01:05:26,500 --> 01:05:28,500
It does have good music in it, though.

912
01:05:28,500 --> 01:05:30,500
Some really good original music.

913
01:05:30,500 --> 01:05:32,500
Perfect Dark Zero was gorgeous.

914
01:05:32,500 --> 01:05:34,500
The levels are humongous.

915
01:05:34,500 --> 01:05:38,500
And there's lots of opportunity to shoot people.

916
01:05:38,500 --> 01:05:42,500
Wait, do you see Ghost Recon 3? Oh my God.

917
01:05:42,500 --> 01:05:44,500
Actually, I wasn't too interested in it.

918
01:05:44,500 --> 01:05:46,500
He had it. It was boring.

919
01:05:46,500 --> 01:05:48,500
What about Condemned? Because I remember you liked it.

920
01:05:48,500 --> 01:05:49,500
Did you get a chance for Condemned yet?

921
01:05:49,500 --> 01:05:50,500
It didn't have it.

922
01:05:50,500 --> 01:05:52,500
Because I remember you liked that one at E3.

923
01:05:52,500 --> 01:05:56,500
Maybe that was the Sega fangirl in you that liked it, I don't know.

924
01:05:56,500 --> 01:05:58,500
I'm looking forward to it.

925
01:05:58,500 --> 01:06:04,500
I'm still waiting for Perfect Dark, and I'm probably going to do, maybe, Condemned.

926
01:06:04,500 --> 01:06:06,500
Ridge Racer, if they send me a free copy.

927
01:06:06,500 --> 01:06:13,500
But, the other one we, also, because that was another game they had there too.

928
01:06:13,500 --> 01:06:17,500
No, it was the, whatever that war game was.

929
01:06:17,500 --> 01:06:19,500
Call of Duty?

930
01:06:19,500 --> 01:06:21,500
Call of Duty, that was it.

931
01:06:21,500 --> 01:06:25,620
Call of Duty was kind of boring. It was pretty but

932
01:06:25,620 --> 01:06:29,940
it's kind of boring. You know the weird thing is that the two games I want most on the

933
01:06:29,940 --> 01:06:32,140
Xbox 360 I can get on another platform.

934
01:06:32,140 --> 01:06:35,500
Quake 4 and Gun. Need for Speed Most Wanted having

935
01:06:35,500 --> 01:06:39,980
compared the Xbox version and the 3, actually this is coming from Dan.

936
01:06:39,980 --> 01:06:45,020
He compared the Xbox version which he's been playing non-stop and the 360 version

937
01:06:45,020 --> 01:06:48,140
and said that actually the Xbox version plays better.

938
01:06:48,140 --> 01:06:53,340
And the 360 version is apparently a slower game.

939
01:06:53,340 --> 01:06:54,780
Cleaned up, but slower.

940
01:06:54,780 --> 01:06:58,260
You know what I bet they're going to do on Xbox 360? It's going to piss me off.

941
01:06:58,260 --> 01:06:59,980
Put out Soulcalibur 3.

942
01:06:59,980 --> 01:07:03,740
That'll piss me off, because I've already bought Soulcalibur 3 for PlayStation.

943
01:07:03,740 --> 01:07:06,940
I have this bad feeling they're going to do it. Why are you so sure they're not going to do it?

944
01:07:06,940 --> 01:07:09,340
Why not? Milk more money out of us.

945
01:07:09,340 --> 01:07:11,540
No, they've said they're not going to.

946
01:07:11,540 --> 01:07:14,220
That was a rumor that was going around about it, and they said no.

947
01:07:14,220 --> 01:07:15,080
Why not?

948
01:07:15,080 --> 01:07:17,380
It's just stupid. Why wouldn't they do it?

949
01:07:17,380 --> 01:07:21,520
Because it's exclusive to Sony. So was Resident Evil 4.

950
01:07:21,520 --> 01:07:24,600
But Sony paid for the rights to have it exclusive before.

951
01:07:24,600 --> 01:07:28,000
And if that's the case, it might come out maybe next year or something like that.

952
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:30,840
Yeah, I didn't say it's going to come out tomorrow.

953
01:07:30,840 --> 01:07:34,440
It would come out, you know, months after it's announced, but I bet you Soul Calibur 3 would end up

954
01:07:34,440 --> 01:07:36,440
getting released for the Xbox 360

955
01:07:36,440 --> 01:07:40,320
outside of Sony's exclusive window, and it's going to have like two new characters or

956
01:07:40,320 --> 01:07:45,760
something good that's going to make us all want to go buy it. And I'm going to be pissed because I already have it on PS2, but it's going to be prettier

957
01:07:45,760 --> 01:07:50,640
On Xbox 360 gun, I would recommend getting it on the current-gen systems

958
01:07:50,640 --> 01:07:54,560
because the 360 is not worth the 10 extra dollars you're paying for. It's the same damn game.

959
01:07:54,560 --> 01:07:56,820
No prettier graphics or anything?

960
01:07:56,820 --> 01:07:59,940
The texture resolution is a little bit higher. The character models

961
01:07:59,940 --> 01:08:01,920
have a few more polygons. That's it.

962
01:08:01,920 --> 01:08:06,480
Not like Night and Day. It's not like, you know, Call of Duty 2 and Big Red 1.

963
01:08:06,480 --> 01:08:07,360
There's

964
01:08:07,360 --> 01:08:08,520
uh...

965
01:08:08,520 --> 01:08:10,160
major differences between those.

966
01:08:10,160 --> 01:08:14,720
As far as Quake 4, I heard that there's problems with the frame rate in Quake 4 making it

967
01:08:14,720 --> 01:08:19,720
and playable in parts because it's so slow on the 360.

968
01:08:19,720 --> 01:08:21,720
Why didn't...

969
01:08:21,720 --> 01:08:27,720
These kind of mistakes kind of just ruffle my feathers. I mean, and you hear about the Xbox's crashing and everything, and it's like,

970
01:08:27,720 --> 01:08:30,720
if it isn't completely fucking obvious that you rushed to get this out on the market...

971
01:08:30,720 --> 01:08:35,720
360, they said... I've read so many things about why it's crashing and overheating and stuff.

972
01:08:35,720 --> 01:08:39,720
One of them, they said there's vent holes in them that some of them are getting punched out.

973
01:08:39,720 --> 01:08:43,720
I didn't get to see the BSOD.

974
01:08:43,720 --> 01:08:47,720
The black screen of death.

975
01:08:47,720 --> 01:08:51,720
The power supply overheats and you have to put it on something that gets

976
01:08:51,720 --> 01:08:55,720
proper ventilation. Yeah, that problem, they're reheating more commonly

977
01:08:55,720 --> 01:08:59,720
when they're kept inside of an

978
01:08:59,720 --> 01:09:03,720
entertainment cabinet. Oh, I see, I can see that.

979
01:09:03,720 --> 01:09:07,720
Because I bet you in a testing environment they don't mimic that. They're so big because they have

980
01:09:07,720 --> 01:09:11,720
a giant fan inside of them. It's retarded. I mean, put this stupid

981
01:09:11,720 --> 01:09:17,280
thing on the system and, you know, forget about it. The hard drive, they said, is overheating.

982
01:09:17,280 --> 01:09:22,880
Just a lot of heat problems. But then they're also, you know, saying, oh, it scratches disks

983
01:09:22,880 --> 01:09:28,480
and stuff. Yeah, when you knock it over, like anything, if you're playing a CD and you knock

984
01:09:28,480 --> 01:09:33,240
the damn thing over, obviously it's going to scratch your stupid CD. It's retarded.

985
01:09:33,240 --> 01:09:38,920
But that's one other thing that was going wrong with it. Problems with the hard drive

986
01:09:38,920 --> 01:09:44,120
being able to read stuff, just problems like that.

987
01:09:44,120 --> 01:09:44,920
It's widespread.

988
01:09:44,920 --> 01:09:47,720
And I haven't heard issues about live or anything.

989
01:09:47,720 --> 01:09:49,640
And when I saw live, it looked pretty cool.

990
01:09:49,640 --> 01:09:53,080
I think it's also a great idea that you can turn the system on

991
01:09:53,080 --> 01:09:55,600
and off from the controller.

992
01:09:55,600 --> 01:09:56,240
Oh, for real.

993
01:09:56,240 --> 01:09:57,000
Now, that's kind of neat.

994
01:09:57,000 --> 01:09:58,160
Yeah, that's pretty cool.

995
01:09:58,160 --> 01:10:01,680
And then I actually did get to see the iPod hookup,

996
01:10:01,680 --> 01:10:03,680
which was pretty cool.

997
01:10:03,680 --> 01:10:04,760
Interesting.

998
01:10:04,760 --> 01:10:07,760
And one of our podcast listeners also

999
01:10:07,760 --> 01:10:10,800
stated that you can actually play your iPod in-game.

1000
01:10:10,800 --> 01:10:14,240
Oh no, that's kind of cool. Play the music in-game.

1001
01:10:14,240 --> 01:10:17,440
And it comes out over your TV.

1002
01:10:17,440 --> 01:10:21,320
It's kind of an interesting little perk. You just can't rip stuff from

1003
01:10:21,320 --> 01:10:24,360
like a USB drive or anything. You can't rip

1004
01:10:24,360 --> 01:10:27,840
from an MP3 player to your hard drive. It has to be from a CD.

1005
01:10:27,840 --> 01:10:32,160
That's not too surprising. Yeah. That kind of feels like one of those last minute

1006
01:10:32,160 --> 01:10:36,360
things that Microsoft just kind of put in there. It actually lets out the music in-game.

1007
01:10:36,360 --> 01:10:38,360
Hmm. Interesting.

1008
01:10:38,360 --> 01:10:47,360
Alright. Well, um, so, I don't know. Me personally, Xbox 360, I think I'm gonna end up waiting until next year to see some more games that are coming out.

1009
01:10:47,360 --> 01:10:53,360
I was totally sold on getting one at launch, but, and had they been readily available everywhere, the impulse buyer in me probably would have done it.

1010
01:10:53,360 --> 01:10:54,360
Yeah.

1011
01:10:54,360 --> 01:10:56,360
So I'm kinda glad they weren't available everywhere.

1012
01:10:56,360 --> 01:10:59,360
I'm buying dance for his birthday next week.

1013
01:10:59,360 --> 01:11:01,360
That's a little different. Birthday, Christmas, you know.

1014
01:11:01,360 --> 01:11:04,360
I was staring down some of those core systems and stuff.

1015
01:11:04,360 --> 01:11:07,440
and stuff. And for example, there's another, there's websites out there where you can still

1016
01:11:07,440 --> 01:11:13,960
get a 360. There's a guy that's getting in 90 next week and he's an online seller selling

1017
01:11:13,960 --> 01:11:20,360
them for, I think slightly over what retail is or something. I don't know. But they're

1018
01:11:20,360 --> 01:11:25,520
out there. They're, just wait until next week when the next shipment comes in and see how

1019
01:11:25,520 --> 01:11:29,800
short they really are on these things. And I bet you anything that's gonna be, you're

1020
01:11:29,800 --> 01:11:33,440
gonna see them in stores regularly. Because it's, what's the point, like I said before,

1021
01:11:33,440 --> 01:11:37,680
driving the hype up if you're not going to replenish the supply. There's no point to

1022
01:11:37,680 --> 01:11:41,880
it. And that was the whole point. They want to make it the must-have item for Christmas.

1023
01:11:41,880 --> 01:11:46,520
If it's going to be the must-have item for Christmas, you've got to have some for Christmas,

1024
01:11:46,520 --> 01:11:47,520
so...

1025
01:11:47,520 --> 01:11:53,560
Yeah, I know. And of course, one of our chatters, Rene, reminding us of the golden rule of gaming,

1026
01:11:53,560 --> 01:11:57,920
a system is only as good as the games that are on it. And that, fundamentally, I think

1027
01:11:57,920 --> 01:12:02,100
is a problem. Well, there are some good games for Xbox 360, but for me, my kind of games,

1028
01:12:02,100 --> 01:12:06,820
the role-playing games and the other type of games, there's just not enough.

1029
01:12:06,820 --> 01:12:13,820
What I'm waiting to hear is I heard that the 360, some of the games may not be region-coded,

1030
01:12:14,740 --> 01:12:19,140
in which case they are not sure if they're region-coding everything or not, because if

1031
01:12:19,140 --> 01:12:22,820
they're not, then you can import like crazy.

1032
01:12:22,820 --> 01:12:25,740
I've heard that rumor as well. That would be, you know, it's, you gotta just do away

1033
01:12:25,740 --> 01:12:26,820
with that region-coding.

1034
01:12:26,820 --> 01:12:28,540
PS3's doing it.

1035
01:12:28,540 --> 01:12:32,540
If I pay 70 bucks to import a Japanese game, then shit, I should just play it.

1036
01:12:32,540 --> 01:12:34,540
PSP doesn't have region-coded games.

1037
01:12:34,540 --> 01:12:35,540
Neither does Dio.

1038
01:12:35,540 --> 01:12:36,540
It's about time they got rid of the...

1039
01:12:36,540 --> 01:12:37,540
I mean, I always thought...

1040
01:12:37,540 --> 01:12:41,540
I understood the reason behind it was to keep games per market

1041
01:12:41,540 --> 01:12:45,540
and track them and all kinds of other super-marketing crap.

1042
01:12:45,540 --> 01:12:47,540
But thanks to the internet, we live in a worldwide market now,

1043
01:12:47,540 --> 01:12:49,540
and I think people are coming to understand that.

1044
01:12:49,540 --> 01:12:50,540
That's what I was going to say, actually.

1045
01:12:50,540 --> 01:12:51,540
What I'm...

1046
01:12:51,540 --> 01:12:53,540
I'm sorry.

1047
01:12:53,540 --> 01:12:57,540
What I'm thinking is, the only regions they should have are PAL and,

1048
01:12:57,540 --> 01:13:02,420
you know NTSC. Well yeah, that makes sense. They should get rid of PAL altogether.

1049
01:13:02,420 --> 01:13:08,100
But isn't it, when we move into the HDTV age, isn't it all standardized?

1050
01:13:08,100 --> 01:13:11,620
Or am I wrong? It's still, maybe some tech junkies in the chat know.

1051
01:13:11,620 --> 01:13:16,700
Technically, I've played PAL discs using my DVD player on my laptop rather than through my TV.

1052
01:13:16,700 --> 01:13:20,820
It worked just fine.

1053
01:13:20,820 --> 01:13:24,220
Interesting. But I'm wondering in the HDTV, with the new HDTVs, because it's a new

1054
01:13:24,220 --> 01:13:27,900
Like, basically the issue between NTSC and PAL is resolution, right?

1055
01:13:27,900 --> 01:13:32,600
So aren't HDTV's resolutions standardized throughout the world, or am I wrong?

1056
01:13:32,600 --> 01:13:33,600
I think they are.

1057
01:13:33,600 --> 01:13:34,600
I do believe so.

1058
01:13:34,600 --> 01:13:35,600
Then good.

1059
01:13:35,600 --> 01:13:36,600
It's like using a computer monitor.

1060
01:13:36,600 --> 01:13:37,600
Yeah.

1061
01:13:37,600 --> 01:13:38,600
Then good.

1062
01:13:38,600 --> 01:13:42,760
Then we're moving towards a standardized there, too, so, you know, and that would be good

1063
01:13:42,760 --> 01:13:46,720
news for overseas people as well, at some point, because that's gonna, that's the reason

1064
01:13:46,720 --> 01:13:51,320
why it takes them so damn long to get their games, usually, is because they have to redo

1065
01:13:51,320 --> 01:13:54,080
all the resolution and stuff, so that's good news for them.

1066
01:13:54,080 --> 01:13:57,100
through multiple languages from the start, boom, done.

1067
01:13:57,100 --> 01:14:00,000
I know. We'll see what happens. Alright, we're going to do one more break. I know he said

1068
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:02,940
we'd do skype line. We will do that when we come back. We're also going to do the cage

1069
01:14:02,940 --> 01:14:07,480
match and anything else we feel like. But I have to go potty, so that means...and Loki's

1070
01:14:07,480 --> 01:14:11,760
going to beat me to it. I have to go potty, so that means we have to break. So we'll be

1071
01:14:11,760 --> 01:14:16,200
back after this. In this break, we'll start it off with a little bit of Super Star. Remember

1072
01:14:16,200 --> 01:14:19,160
this song? Dark Sakura? We used to love this song. I still do, but...

1073
01:14:19,160 --> 01:14:22,040
It used to be my PA song. Dancing to this song was wonderful.

1074
01:14:22,040 --> 01:14:24,040
It used to be my P.A. song, Good Times.

1075
01:14:52,040 --> 01:14:53,040
You never beat me

1076
01:14:53,040 --> 01:14:54,040
And I'm just your partner

1077
01:14:54,040 --> 01:14:55,040
So let me just go

1078
01:14:55,040 --> 01:14:56,040
I can't even write what you made

1079
01:14:56,040 --> 01:14:57,040
Just write me down

1080
01:14:57,040 --> 01:14:58,040
It's going through retirement

1081
01:14:58,040 --> 01:14:59,040
And make a five point

1082
01:14:59,040 --> 01:15:00,040
You have done it, you got me

1083
01:15:00,040 --> 01:15:02,040
Cause you're mine and my whole life

1084
01:15:09,040 --> 01:15:10,040
You need to break

1085
01:15:10,040 --> 01:15:11,040
When your lines ain't changing

1086
01:15:11,040 --> 01:15:12,040
When you're lyrical to me

1087
01:15:12,040 --> 01:15:13,040
And when your style ain't great

1088
01:15:13,040 --> 01:15:14,040
You got D.B.I. five

1089
01:15:14,040 --> 01:15:15,040
Gotta pull it over, turn

1090
01:15:15,040 --> 01:15:16,040
Your station is not worth winning

1091
01:15:16,040 --> 01:15:17,040
When you learn that smile's not a word

1092
01:15:17,040 --> 01:15:18,040
But when you make a move

1093
01:15:18,040 --> 01:15:19,040
You get to dance like a ball

1094
01:15:19,040 --> 01:15:20,040
You'll deserve like well

1095
01:15:20,040 --> 01:15:21,040
I'm like too low

1096
01:15:51,040 --> 01:15:53,440
Now here's a chance for everybody up and on the floor

1097
01:15:53,440 --> 01:15:55,440
I wanna see you dance!

1098
01:17:53,440 --> 01:18:08,440
In the evening, I'll let you know

1099
01:18:08,440 --> 01:18:13,440
The words of your body are your symptoms

1100
01:18:13,440 --> 01:18:18,440
And they're never gonna understand

1101
01:18:18,440 --> 01:18:29,440
Love me, kiss me with every heaven said I'm sorry, love you

1102
01:18:29,440 --> 01:18:37,440
Why, but every night I look at the sky

1103
01:18:37,440 --> 01:18:44,440
All your name and my name

1104
01:18:44,440 --> 01:18:51,440
Every night, every night

1105
01:18:51,440 --> 01:18:58,440
Make me feel like I'm dreaming of coming back

1106
01:20:51,440 --> 01:20:59,480
Hi-ho, Kermit the Frog here, informing you that today's broadcast of Orange Lounge Radio

1107
01:20:59,480 --> 01:21:03,760
is brought to you by the letter B, the letter A, and the number 59.

1108
01:21:03,760 --> 01:21:12,000
We're back here at Boys and Girls on Orange Lounge Radio, and I hope you enjoyed that

1109
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:13,000
break.

1110
01:21:13,000 --> 01:21:14,680
A little, just some potpourri music there.

1111
01:21:14,680 --> 01:21:18,360
I tried to put in some stuff that I know Jamie likes, so we haven't played in a while.

1112
01:21:18,360 --> 01:21:22,340
I'm kind of doing stuff I think Jamie likes tonight because, you know, it's been a while

1113
01:21:22,340 --> 01:21:27,220
since she's been here and getting to dictate the picks in my ear, but she hasn't really

1114
01:21:27,220 --> 01:21:30,060
said a lot of songs she wants to hear tonight, so I'm playing stuff I think she'd want to

1115
01:21:30,060 --> 01:21:31,060
hear.

1116
01:21:31,060 --> 01:21:32,060
Am I doing good?

1117
01:21:32,060 --> 01:21:33,060
So far, so good.

1118
01:21:33,060 --> 01:21:34,060
So far, so good.

1119
01:21:34,060 --> 01:21:38,340
In that break, we heard Superstar, The Safari, because I know you love The Safari, Look to

1120
01:21:38,340 --> 01:21:41,060
the Sky, I don't know how big you are on that song, that was more for the listeners because

1121
01:21:41,060 --> 01:21:46,300
I know that's a listener favorite, and era, Ta-Taku, which we had to do, we had to do

1122
01:21:46,300 --> 01:21:50,200
at least one song by him. So maybe some more Jamie-inspired stuff next

1123
01:21:50,200 --> 01:21:51,960
break. But for now, we're actually going to head

1124
01:21:51,960 --> 01:21:58,340
on over to the Skype line, and if you would like to call us, please do so.

1125
01:21:58,340 --> 01:22:05,340
Just head on over to www.orangelinesradio.com and click on Interact With Us.

1126
01:22:05,600 --> 01:22:09,240
Sorry, the program was being unruly there for a minute, I had to figure out what's going

1127
01:22:09,240 --> 01:22:12,400
on. There we go, yes, we're up and ready to go

1128
01:22:12,400 --> 01:22:17,360
on Skype if you guys want to call in. Also we have a, oh it's, oh the Skype server might

1129
01:22:17,360 --> 01:22:22,040
be down right now actually because it's still showing us it's connecting. So, we're going

1130
01:22:22,040 --> 01:22:26,880
to have to proceed. Okay, we're not going to take calls to Skype just yet. Live Radio

1131
01:22:26,880 --> 01:22:30,440
can't control and the servers go up and down boys and girls. So let's actually head on

1132
01:22:30,440 --> 01:22:34,680
over and see what else is going on in the Bahmani world. I had mentioned earlier in

1133
01:22:34,680 --> 01:22:39,360
the show I checked out 2DX10 style this week. I don't know if either of you guys have gotten

1134
01:22:39,360 --> 01:22:43,880
a chance to play it. Jamie, have you really picked up 9th or 10th? I thought you got 9th,

1135
01:22:43,880 --> 01:22:48,080
but no, you never got 9th or 10th. Is one of those things where it's kind of getting

1136
01:22:48,080 --> 01:22:56,600
old? Kind of. I don't know. I can keep in mind, I work full-time and go to school part-time.

1137
01:22:56,600 --> 01:23:02,880
I really don't have a lot of time left over for BB&E until the end of the semester. And

1138
01:23:02,880 --> 01:23:08,040
I played a whole lot of 8th style over the summer, because I wasn't going to classes.

1139
01:23:08,040 --> 01:23:13,040
But I figured that I was gonna wait and pick up 10th Style because I refused to play 9th Style.

1140
01:23:13,040 --> 01:23:15,040
Why 9th Style?

1141
01:23:15,040 --> 01:23:17,040
Just because of how crappy the arcade release was.

1142
01:23:17,040 --> 01:23:19,040
Well, you know the timing's fine in the home version.

1143
01:23:19,040 --> 01:23:20,040
It's not...

1144
01:23:20,040 --> 01:23:22,040
But I also didn't really have much in it I liked.

1145
01:23:22,040 --> 01:23:25,040
You know what's funny is I have just the reverse with 10th Style.

1146
01:23:25,040 --> 01:23:29,040
Like, I played 10th Style and it's put together beautifully, and the song list is okay,

1147
01:23:29,040 --> 01:23:35,040
and it's a really great looking game, especially because they've upped the resolution from the old 3rd, 4th styles,

1148
01:23:35,040 --> 01:23:40,040
And it's just, it's a very sharp looking game, and it's nice, but I find that when I was playing it, I was kind of like,

1149
01:23:40,040 --> 01:23:43,040
where's all these songs I like from 9th Style?

1150
01:23:43,040 --> 01:23:45,040
See, I like 9th Style an awful lot.

1151
01:23:45,040 --> 01:23:47,540
I still think 8th has the best of all of them.

1152
01:23:47,540 --> 01:23:53,540
8th had a really solid song list, especially the arcade release, but, I don't know, I just, I do love 9th.

1153
01:23:53,540 --> 01:23:59,040
So, as soon as I get a new controller, because we're pretty confident that the US is getting their own controller

1154
01:23:59,040 --> 01:24:03,040
that's gonna be different, and hopefully better,

1155
01:24:03,040 --> 01:24:05,040
That's when I'll truly get back into 2DX.

1156
01:24:05,040 --> 01:24:09,040
But Miklasov was nice. He offered to let me borrow his 10th style and controller,

1157
01:24:09,040 --> 01:24:11,040
because I'm supposed to be seeing him this weekend, too.

1158
01:24:11,040 --> 01:24:14,040
And he offered to let me borrow it all week so I could really test drive it, but I said,

1159
01:24:14,040 --> 01:24:17,040
I'm gonna be too busy with Dragon Quest VIII.

1160
01:24:17,040 --> 01:24:22,040
Well, you know, my controller still works perfectly fine and it fell off the top of the van.

1161
01:24:22,040 --> 01:24:24,040
I don't know how that is.

1162
01:24:24,040 --> 01:24:26,040
I can't... You have the miracle controller.

1163
01:24:26,040 --> 01:24:28,040
I've been doing it three times.

1164
01:24:28,040 --> 01:24:30,040
That's still something else.

1165
01:24:30,040 --> 01:24:40,620
I want to ask Loki about this real quick. These are some articles you posted on the

1166
01:24:40,620 --> 01:24:45,640
site about the portable DDR and Beatmania sim games that are out there. What's going

1167
01:24:45,640 --> 01:24:48,740
on with this? I know this isn't your sim scene up there, but what's going on with these PSP

1168
01:24:48,740 --> 01:24:49,740
clones?

1169
01:24:49,740 --> 01:24:57,200
Well, I mentioned last week about the old DDR1, and it's pretty cool. You get to actually

1170
01:24:57,200 --> 01:25:07,340
it's basically StepMania for the PSP. Now, the BeatMania one, not quite so much like

1171
01:25:07,340 --> 01:25:13,840
BeatMania for the PSP. It's more of a two-button BeatMania because the way the buttons are

1172
01:25:13,840 --> 01:25:21,640
mapped. But you could actually, I guess, remap everything so that you could play, you know,

1173
01:25:21,640 --> 01:25:28,360
songs using their corresponding keys, but with a PSP it's kind of hard to play 7-key

1174
01:25:28,360 --> 01:25:36,560
BeatMania on it, obviously. I was actually installing that on my PSP right now, as you

1175
01:25:36,560 --> 01:25:45,000
caught me. No, it looks really good, actually. They've got quite a setup for DDR and stuff.

1176
01:25:45,000 --> 01:25:50,120
This one looks like it's more of like, I don't know, delight, delight reduplication or whatever,

1177
01:25:50,120 --> 01:25:54,120
because you can do DDR in the BeatMania setup as well.

1178
01:25:54,120 --> 01:25:59,120
Then they also have 2DX in normal BeatMania as well,

1179
01:25:59,120 --> 01:26:03,120
so I'm not really sure how that works,

1180
01:26:03,120 --> 01:26:05,120
but it looks pretty cool,

1181
01:26:05,120 --> 01:26:09,120
and they've got really good skins for it.

1182
01:26:09,120 --> 01:26:14,120
And both of them are available on PSP updates right now,

1183
01:26:14,120 --> 01:26:18,120
but I think we'll be adding them maybe to the PSP site at some point.

1184
01:26:18,120 --> 01:26:19,600
Alright, sounds good.

1185
01:26:19,600 --> 01:26:20,600
Umm...

1186
01:26:22,040 --> 01:26:23,960
There was one? I know there was something else I was dying to mention.

1187
01:26:23,960 --> 01:26:24,840
Oh, STRIKE!

1188
01:26:24,840 --> 01:26:28,840
There's lots of updates on DDR STRIKE that was going on over on DDRFreak.

1189
01:26:28,840 --> 01:26:31,240
Some folks had found some pictures...

1190
01:26:31,240 --> 01:26:32,600
Dammit, and I wish I'd gotten to this one.

1191
01:26:32,600 --> 01:26:35,080
Mikolatov was here, because maybe he could have elaborated a little bit,

1192
01:26:35,080 --> 01:26:37,400
even though I know he can't say a whole lot about work stuff.

1193
01:26:37,400 --> 01:26:38,400
Umm...

1194
01:26:38,400 --> 01:26:42,800
But there was some stuff going on on the threads over on DDRFreak

1195
01:26:42,800 --> 01:26:45,920
that they found some scans in a magazine that gave away some stuff

1196
01:26:45,920 --> 01:26:51,160
about the upcoming DDR Strike game and it looks like they were able to find in

1197
01:26:51,160 --> 01:26:56,280
the scan of the magazine article they found that there's some new Toshiba EMI

1198
01:26:56,280 --> 01:27:00,560
license tracks that are coming to DDR Strike which some folks speculated was

1199
01:27:00,560 --> 01:27:03,640
going to be happening with DDR Strike but nobody was actually able to confirm.

1200
01:27:03,640 --> 01:27:07,360
That's pretty cool. And what's interesting though, some of them are

1201
01:27:07,360 --> 01:27:12,680
crossovers from DDR Extreme 2. For instance, as the rush comes and Block,

1202
01:27:12,680 --> 01:27:15,360
Block, Rock, and Beats, which we had in DDR Extreme 2.

1203
01:27:15,360 --> 01:27:20,960
But here's the weird thing, is that they have tied them to DanceMania releases, because

1204
01:27:20,960 --> 01:27:27,740
As the Rush Comes was on DanceMania EX7, and Block, Rock, and Beats was on DanceMania Winters.

1205
01:27:27,740 --> 01:27:30,720
So I'm not sure, it's very interesting how this worked.

1206
01:27:30,720 --> 01:27:34,520
I don't know if, were these games chosen for the US first, or were they actually chosen

1207
01:27:34,520 --> 01:27:37,560
for Japan, and we got them anyway because they were easy to license.

1208
01:27:37,560 --> 01:27:38,560
We don't know.

1209
01:27:38,560 --> 01:27:42,280
But also, apparently, the scan in the magazine, or whatever it is, also gives away a couple

1210
01:27:42,280 --> 01:27:47,560
other songs. Heaven is a Place on Earth, the German election mix from Dance Media Covers

1211
01:27:47,560 --> 01:27:52,840
01 and Let's Dance by David Bowie, which I think is a very sexy addition to DDR. I can't

1212
01:27:52,840 --> 01:27:54,600
believe we're getting David Bowie. That is badass.

1213
01:27:54,600 --> 01:27:58,020
David Bowie is so hot. He's going to be in a movie with Michael

1214
01:27:58,020 --> 01:28:03,080
Kane. Oh, that'd be great. Can't wait. And then You Sexy Thing by Hot Chocolate, and

1215
01:28:03,080 --> 01:28:08,780
I can't think of what song the You Sexy Thing is, though, but I think that's that old song

1216
01:28:08,780 --> 01:28:09,780
from, uh...

1217
01:28:09,780 --> 01:28:10,780
You Sexy Thing.

1218
01:28:10,780 --> 01:28:11,780
You Sexy Thing.

1219
01:28:11,780 --> 01:28:18,220
I don't think I remember hearing that song either, did it?

1220
01:28:18,220 --> 01:28:22,100
I remember, like, the line on it, but I don't remember how the song goes.

1221
01:28:22,100 --> 01:28:25,780
It just must be because I have completely different taste than that.

1222
01:28:25,780 --> 01:28:26,780
I have no idea.

1223
01:28:26,780 --> 01:28:31,940
Well, it's good to see that this game isn't just going to be a rehash of DDR Extreme 2

1224
01:28:31,940 --> 01:28:35,700
like I was thinking it was going to be, but, I don't know, new stuff's always good.

1225
01:28:35,700 --> 01:28:40,340
Well, I think what's also interesting is that there's some crossovers from Ultramix 2, at

1226
01:28:40,340 --> 01:28:44,420
least one, which we can kind of infer, because there's going to be one, there will be more

1227
01:28:44,420 --> 01:28:51,620
than one, Baille la Samba, which was the Konami original for Ultramix 2, is crossing over,

1228
01:28:51,620 --> 01:28:56,200
and that was picked off from one of the mission mode screens, a very observant person on DDR

1229
01:28:56,200 --> 01:28:58,420
Freak noticed that the banners match up.

1230
01:28:58,420 --> 01:29:00,580
So Baille la Samba is going to be there as well.

1231
01:29:00,580 --> 01:29:06,760
So that is starting speculation as to might we see some of the freebie songs, because

1232
01:29:06,760 --> 01:29:11,940
as you know, a different drum sort of gave songs to Konami, not really had them licensed

1233
01:29:11,940 --> 01:29:16,100
but gave them for the exposure, and that's where we got Skulk and Superstar.

1234
01:29:16,100 --> 01:29:20,340
So it'd be very, very interesting if some of these songs showed up in the Japanese mix.

1235
01:29:20,340 --> 01:29:21,660
I think that'd be kind of cool for them.

1236
01:29:21,660 --> 01:29:22,660
That would be.

1237
01:29:22,660 --> 01:29:28,500
Um, I think for sure they will get Jyris and, um, probably the Midihead mix and some of

1238
01:29:28,500 --> 01:29:31,680
the other stuff. They'll probably get all that crap for sure. I don't see how they couldn't

1239
01:29:31,680 --> 01:29:32,680
get that stuff.

1240
01:29:32,680 --> 01:29:38,420
Well, also when you think about it, was it Festival had Ultramix One stuff in it, so

1241
01:29:38,420 --> 01:29:40,880
it only makes sense that they would do that.

1242
01:29:40,880 --> 01:29:45,200
Yeah, I think a lot of people, this really isn't surprising anyone, but it's kind of

1243
01:29:45,200 --> 01:29:46,200
cool nonetheless.

1244
01:29:46,200 --> 01:29:52,800
So, what else we got going on with Strike? Then this came up later in the thread, is

1245
01:29:52,800 --> 01:29:56,600
that somebody actually got a screenshot and knew enough Japanese to kind of translate

1246
01:29:56,600 --> 01:30:01,200
the little tiny, um, stuff that shows up there on the side, and notices that there is no

1247
01:30:01,200 --> 01:30:05,000
online mode for the Japanese, uh, DDR Strike release.

1248
01:30:05,000 --> 01:30:10,720
Uh, interesting. I don't know if that's because DDR they don't think is popular over there?

1249
01:30:10,720 --> 01:30:13,480
I'm not sure. I'm not sure what to think of this, why they're not doing the online mode.

1250
01:30:13,480 --> 01:30:15,400
Or maybe it's just an early screenshot. Who knows?

1251
01:30:15,400 --> 01:30:22,160
Or maybe because the Extreme 2 Online sucked? That's true, too. Doesn't it have bugs, too?

1252
01:30:22,160 --> 01:30:24,560
Aren't people still cheating on there and stuff?

1253
01:30:24,560 --> 01:30:29,240
sucked apparently compared to the Xbox one it does it's too bad that extreme 2

1254
01:30:29,240 --> 01:30:33,800
came out later but I realize there's a lot of anti Microsoft people for lack of

1255
01:30:33,800 --> 01:30:37,720
a better term people that don't have Xbox's for financial just don't want to

1256
01:30:37,720 --> 01:30:42,720
whatever reasons that haven't gone to experience the Xbox live and I'll tell

1257
01:30:42,720 --> 01:30:46,960
you what guys I used to be anti Microsoft too and in some in some

1258
01:30:46,960 --> 01:30:50,760
circumstances I still am to some extent I don't like some of the things they do

1259
01:30:50,760 --> 01:30:55,680
do but I've come to accept embrace some of the things that are really great

1260
01:30:55,680 --> 01:30:59,600
about Xbox one of them being they have advanced videos or the other one being

1261
01:30:59,600 --> 01:31:06,200
that they have the best online system that kicks ps2's but I mean Xbox Live

1262
01:31:06,200 --> 01:31:09,840
kicks anything else's but basically right now that's out there in the

1263
01:31:09,840 --> 01:31:14,920
console world and so to go and play DDR on the Xbox Live and then go to play it

1264
01:31:14,920 --> 01:31:18,600
on Xtreme 2 you're like yeah this sucks but I bet for people that have never

1265
01:31:18,600 --> 01:31:22,840
played Xbox Live they probably don't know that it can be a lot better so it

1266
01:31:22,840 --> 01:31:26,960
works out just fine for them so yeah I don't know still kind of interesting if

1267
01:31:26,960 --> 01:31:33,280
they left it out who knows of course more to come still on this game we will

1268
01:31:33,280 --> 01:31:37,480
see what happens a little later I'm sure the surprise is still left in store who

1269
01:31:37,480 --> 01:31:42,320
knows let's see if we can get Skype working I'm having the worst problems

1270
01:31:42,320 --> 01:31:48,300
getting this Skype program to work if I'm unable to get this to happen what

1271
01:31:48,300 --> 01:31:51,420
we'll do is we'll probably go to the cage match yeah Skype is doing some

1272
01:31:51,420 --> 01:31:57,480
weird stuff with me guys that's gonna be too bad if we have to do a show without

1273
01:31:57,480 --> 01:32:00,600
Skype because I'd love to hear from our listeners we'd love to hear what they

1274
01:32:00,600 --> 01:32:05,580
have to say let's try this one more time here we're gonna try connecting there

1275
01:32:05,580 --> 01:32:11,600
and yeah I got booted again that's great okay so we're gonna go ahead and actually

1276
01:32:11,600 --> 01:32:14,360
we're gonna go into the cage match for right now and try to get some time for

1277
01:32:14,360 --> 01:32:17,280
Skype to come back up and we'll go to the Skype line a little later in the

1278
01:32:17,280 --> 01:32:20,360
show and I'm sorry guys I don't know what's happening there I'm having timeout

1279
01:32:20,360 --> 01:32:23,960
problems some of you might be on it we're just having some problems here in

1280
01:32:23,960 --> 01:32:27,080
studio so I'm going to try some other things here while we go into the cage

1281
01:32:27,080 --> 01:32:34,920
match but it is time to get into this week's cage match now the nice thing

1282
01:32:34,920 --> 01:32:37,680
about cage matches that we don't need our skype line for cage match we only

1283
01:32:37,680 --> 01:32:41,120
need the chat room so you gotta be in our chat room if you want to vote in

1284
01:32:41,120 --> 01:32:44,840
cage match and that's www.orangelaundraider.com and click on chat and

1285
01:32:44,840 --> 01:32:55,840
And the way the Cage Match works is that we're going to play three songs for you guys, and your favorite song will go into rotation all week long on Orange Lounge Radio's Bomani and Video Game Music program.

1286
01:32:55,840 --> 01:32:59,840
And we had a winning song last week, it was a brand new winner, and it was something that Loki picked.

1287
01:32:59,840 --> 01:33:03,840
And the song was by John Sykes, and it was called Cautionary Warning.

1288
01:33:03,840 --> 01:33:06,840
And anything else you want to say about this song, Loki?

1289
01:33:06,840 --> 01:33:07,840
Your mic's off.

1290
01:33:07,840 --> 01:33:09,840
Uh, it's just a really cool song.

1291
01:33:09,840 --> 01:33:15,840
Okay, here it is, a clip of last week's winner, John Sykes, with cautionary warning, and here's a clip.

1292
01:33:39,840 --> 01:34:07,840
You are my excavator, you are my space invader

1293
01:34:07,840 --> 01:34:10,600
Oh, I should never have warned that I would go

1294
01:34:10,600 --> 01:34:12,600
You are my kind of ganger

1295
01:34:12,600 --> 01:34:14,840
You are my indicator

1296
01:34:14,840 --> 01:34:16,840
You are my egg of a maker

1297
01:34:16,840 --> 01:34:19,840
Oh, I should never have warned that I would go

1298
01:34:29,840 --> 01:34:32,340
Don't tear you down, have you locked yourself to the floor?

1299
01:34:32,340 --> 01:34:34,340
You're the one who believed in saying your soul

1300
01:34:34,340 --> 01:34:36,340
Now only time will tell

1301
01:35:06,340 --> 01:35:13,340
All right, that was song number one in tonight's cage match, a clip of last week's winner John

1302
01:35:15,700 --> 01:35:20,040
Sykes, cautionary warning. Well, now I'm remembering that song. That's the one where the Whitesnake

1303
01:35:20,040 --> 01:35:25,780
guitarist or something has something to do with that, right, Logie?

1304
01:35:25,780 --> 01:35:26,700
That's very correct.

1305
01:35:26,700 --> 01:35:30,300
All right, interesting. All right, song number two in tonight's cage match will be my pick.

1306
01:35:30,300 --> 01:35:35,140
I'm going to go ahead and go. My song is, too bad Miklos has not here because he talked

1307
01:35:35,140 --> 01:35:39,540
the song up for me. My song is by an artist named Andy Bell, and Andy Bell was half of

1308
01:35:39,540 --> 01:35:45,540
Racer, you know, the great 80s and 90s synth-pop band. I love synth-pop. Andy Bell has a solo

1309
01:35:45,540 --> 01:35:55,540
album out now, and it's pretty cool. I like... I had to put in a... Fuckin' mic, I hit this

1310
01:35:55,540 --> 01:35:59,580
mic. You know I love me some synth-pop! So I had to put this in because Andy Bell is

1311
01:35:59,580 --> 01:36:03,260
one of the granddaddies of synth-pop, going back to Yaz and all these other great bands.

1312
01:36:03,260 --> 01:36:06,760
I love this song, it's the latest CD, Electric Blue, it's song number two in tonight's cage,

1313
01:36:06,760 --> 01:36:08,760
much crazy here on Orange Lodge Radio.

1314
01:36:36,760 --> 01:36:39,760
You better make some noise

1315
01:36:39,760 --> 01:36:43,760
Cause my desire

1316
01:36:43,760 --> 01:36:46,760
Is running down a city street

1317
01:36:46,760 --> 01:36:50,760
Hold me up to the wire

1318
01:36:50,760 --> 01:36:53,760
I'm driven by a heavy beat

1319
01:36:53,760 --> 01:36:57,760
When you put your hand in my hand

1320
01:36:57,760 --> 01:37:01,760
I go down and I go crazy for you

1321
01:37:01,760 --> 01:37:05,760
Crazy, crazy

1322
01:37:05,760 --> 01:37:08,760
Crazy

1323
01:37:08,760 --> 01:37:12,760
I feel so ashamed to tell you

1324
01:37:12,760 --> 01:37:17,760
I go down there, I go crazy for you

1325
01:37:17,760 --> 01:37:20,760
Crazy, crazy

1326
01:37:20,760 --> 01:37:23,760
Crazy

1327
01:37:23,760 --> 01:37:40,760
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

1328
01:37:40,760 --> 01:37:48,760
And that she was good You never told a lie

1329
01:37:48,760 --> 01:37:54,760
And if you're sweet tonight, I'll have an alibi

1330
01:37:54,760 --> 01:38:01,760
Cause my desire is running down a city street

1331
01:38:01,760 --> 01:38:05,760
Hold me up to the wire

1332
01:38:05,760 --> 01:38:08,760
I'm driven by a heavy beat

1333
01:38:08,760 --> 01:38:12,760
When you put your hand in my hand

1334
01:38:12,760 --> 01:38:17,760
I go down and I go crazy for you

1335
01:38:17,760 --> 01:38:19,760
Crazy, crazy

1336
01:38:19,760 --> 01:38:23,760
Crazy, crazy

1337
01:38:23,760 --> 01:38:27,760
I feel so ashamed to tell you

1338
01:38:27,760 --> 01:38:32,760
I go down, man, I go crazy for you

1339
01:38:32,760 --> 01:38:34,760
Crazy, crazy

1340
01:38:34,760 --> 01:38:38,760
Every day

1341
01:38:54,760 --> 01:38:58,760
Cause my desire

1342
01:38:58,760 --> 01:39:01,760
Is running down a city street

1343
01:39:01,760 --> 01:39:05,760
Hold me up, choose a wire

1344
01:39:05,760 --> 01:39:08,760
I'll dribble by your heavy knees

1345
01:39:08,760 --> 01:39:12,760
When you put your hand in my hand

1346
01:39:12,760 --> 01:39:16,760
I go down, then I go crazy for you

1347
01:39:16,760 --> 01:39:23,760
Crazy, crazy

1348
01:39:23,760 --> 01:39:27,760
I feel so ashamed to tell you

1349
01:39:27,760 --> 01:39:37,580
And I go, and I go raging for you crazy, crazy

1350
01:39:57,760 --> 01:40:08,320
Okay, there's song number two in tonight's cage mesh, and it's Andy Bell with Crazy,

1351
01:40:08,320 --> 01:40:11,800
and we'll go around and see what folks thought of that, if they were crazy for that song

1352
01:40:11,800 --> 01:40:12,800
or it drove them crazy.

1353
01:40:12,800 --> 01:40:13,800
Dork Sucko, you're up first.

1354
01:40:13,800 --> 01:40:14,800
No offense, it was a little repetitive.

1355
01:40:14,800 --> 01:40:15,800
I didn't write it.

1356
01:40:15,800 --> 01:40:16,800
Oh, no.

1357
01:40:16,800 --> 01:40:27,080
It was okay, it wasn't a bad song, but I just find it a little repetitive and kind

1358
01:40:27,080 --> 01:40:32,920
boring so it gets 6.5. I've been blasting a song in my car all week. I really like it.

1359
01:40:32,920 --> 01:40:41,880
Uh, 9. Loki, that song's craaazy. I'll hold 7.5. Okay, alright, moving on to song number

1360
01:40:41,880 --> 01:40:47,240
3 in tonight's gauge match, Dark Sakura. Who'd you pick for us? Um, because this song's on

1361
01:40:47,240 --> 01:40:51,960
a Saturday, which is usually the day I think about what I'm gonna play, um, I just picked

1362
01:40:51,960 --> 01:40:58,960
the Blur song so it's a crazy beat. Alright, sound over 3 in tonight's cage match. Blur!

1363
01:40:58,960 --> 01:41:01,600
Blur! With Crazy Beat. Enjoy.

1364
01:41:58,960 --> 01:42:27,960
I'm on my own about to start a revolution Got a hand for a party I've been dying to get in

1365
01:42:27,960 --> 01:42:32,960
Like me, I hear that my body makes me sick

1366
01:42:32,960 --> 01:42:34,960
And I love to hear that say

1367
01:42:34,960 --> 01:42:37,960
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

1368
01:42:37,960 --> 01:42:40,960
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

1369
01:42:40,960 --> 01:42:43,960
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

1370
01:42:43,960 --> 01:42:46,960
I love my sister and I love her tonight

1371
01:42:46,960 --> 01:43:01,960
Breakdown

1372
01:44:01,960 --> 01:44:08,960
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

1373
01:44:08,960 --> 01:44:11,960
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

1374
01:44:16,960 --> 01:44:22,960
Okay, there was song number 3 in tonight's cage match. That was Blur with Crazy Beat.

1375
01:44:22,960 --> 01:44:26,960
Once again, are you crazy about that song or did it drive you crazy? Dark Sakura.

1376
01:44:26,960 --> 01:44:30,960
It's actually not my favorite Blur song, but I like it.

1377
01:44:34,960 --> 01:44:36,960
Give it to me an 8.5.

1378
01:44:36,960 --> 01:44:41,960
For me, it works better for Cagemash than I thought it would. I still think it was a little bit noisy.

1379
01:44:41,960 --> 01:44:45,960
I don't really know how it would just go. A little bit noisy? But it's cool.

1380
01:44:45,960 --> 01:44:50,960
I mean, it's a fun kick some butt anthem. I like that.

1381
01:44:50,960 --> 01:44:58,960
You know, it's a good song to kind of rotate with song 2, because I know a lot of people are all about song 2, and that's the only Blur song they know of song 2.

1382
01:44:58,960 --> 01:45:05,960
But that's a good one to kind of mix it up a little bit with, because it reminds me of song 2, but it's different! Which is a good thing.

1383
01:45:05,960 --> 01:45:08,960
So, um, I give it an 8. I liked it.

1384
01:45:08,960 --> 01:45:09,960
Loki.

1385
01:45:09,960 --> 01:45:12,960
That song was crazy!

1386
01:45:12,960 --> 01:45:13,960
7.5.

1387
01:45:13,960 --> 01:45:20,960
I just thought it would be funny, since both songs are crazy.

1388
01:45:24,960 --> 01:45:31,960
It's time for you guys to vote as soon as we recap. Here we go, the three songs you

1389
01:45:31,960 --> 01:45:35,760
to vote as soon as we recap here we go the three songs you can vote for tonight

1390
01:45:35,760 --> 01:45:42,080
starting off with song number one which is Cautionary Warning

1391
01:45:47,480 --> 01:45:53,480
and song number two you can vote for tonight is Andy Bell with Crazy

1392
01:45:53,480 --> 01:45:58,480
Crazy, crazy, crazy

1393
01:45:58,480 --> 01:46:02,480
And song number three you can vote for tonight is Blur with Crazy Beat

1394
01:46:02,480 --> 01:46:10,480
Blur with Crazy Beat

1395
01:46:10,480 --> 01:46:16,480
Alright kids, you know what to do. Place vote now. Send a private message to Sky in the chatroom with your vote

1396
01:46:16,480 --> 01:46:21,480
and we will reveal the winner of the vote as soon as we can

1397
01:46:21,480 --> 01:46:24,800
Moving on over to Loki to talk about what else is going on in the Sims scene

1398
01:46:24,800 --> 01:46:28,000
besides the PSP thing, which, by the way, you actually showed me because you

1399
01:46:28,000 --> 01:46:29,800
downloaded it there during the last little bit.

1400
01:46:29,800 --> 01:46:33,300
It's pretty cool. That actually looks kinda neat. The skin's a little fucked because your

1401
01:46:33,300 --> 01:46:35,080
life bar's in the middle of the screen, but...

1402
01:46:35,080 --> 01:46:38,920
Well, there's four skins. I haven't tried the other four skins.

1403
01:46:38,920 --> 01:46:42,240
I walked right into that joke.

1404
01:46:42,240 --> 01:46:45,960
No, there's supposedly four different skins for it.

1405
01:46:45,960 --> 01:46:50,280
It's weird, though, because you can do, like, DDR and stuff, but I haven't actually tried some of the

1406
01:46:50,280 --> 01:46:50,920
other skins.

1407
01:46:50,920 --> 01:46:56,920
I've been basically using a default one. I don't really notice the life bar in the middle, so it's not a big problem for me.

1408
01:46:56,920 --> 01:47:06,920
The keys, though, are a little fucked up, but I probably should have not been trying to play one key P1807. That just didn't work very well.

1409
01:47:06,920 --> 01:47:09,920
No wonder you had one key assigned to all your buttons. What was that about?

1410
01:47:09,920 --> 01:47:14,920
Well, that's the default settings they have. Try doing seven key on a PSP.

1411
01:47:14,920 --> 01:47:17,920
But then why point the damn thing to a PSP?

1412
01:47:17,920 --> 01:47:24,460
I don't know. But 5-key though works pretty well. So I am getting some nice 5-key SIM

1413
01:47:24,460 --> 01:47:30,060
files to try on it, because I don't know, it could work for that.

1414
01:47:30,060 --> 01:47:35,680
Other than that, there is some stuff going on. I know on BomaniStyle right now, they

1415
01:47:35,680 --> 01:47:43,320
are actually doing OSC4, which is another SIM file contest, not to be confused with

1416
01:47:43,320 --> 01:47:49,720
with Turning Mix, which is not going on anymore. But, anyways, OSC4, I believe, is available

1417
01:47:49,720 --> 01:47:54,640
for download right now. You can check it out. They've got some links on their front page

1418
01:47:54,640 --> 01:48:01,760
there, and they also kind of talk about who's judging and how it's going to go and that

1419
01:48:01,760 --> 01:48:06,320
type of stuff. So, check it out now. It's the keyboard division, so these are all going

1420
01:48:06,320 --> 01:48:10,400
to be the ones that are impossible to play, so check those out.

1421
01:48:10,400 --> 01:48:12,200
Not you, we're laughing at the chatroom.

1422
01:48:12,200 --> 01:48:13,000
No, that's alright.

1423
01:48:13,000 --> 01:48:19,000
Somebody just said, somebody just joined and we said that they missed the cage match and their response was, and I quote,

1424
01:48:19,000 --> 01:48:21,000
Shit shit shitty shit shit.

1425
01:48:23,000 --> 01:48:25,200
It's the little things in life that amuse me. Anyway, sorry.

1426
01:48:25,200 --> 01:48:27,000
I'm glad that everyone likes that.

1427
01:48:27,600 --> 01:48:34,000
Which, by the way, is when I think about a large part of the Bimani files that are being put out lately as shit shit shitty shit shit.

1428
01:48:34,000 --> 01:48:34,800
Those sim files.

1429
01:48:34,800 --> 01:48:37,460
since you mentioned shit shit shitty shit shit

1430
01:48:37,460 --> 01:48:40,160
uh... i have to mention

1431
01:48:40,160 --> 01:48:44,120
sim files for the week and uh... starting off with

1432
01:48:44,120 --> 01:48:47,600
max don't have sex with your ex not exactly a max remix but still you know

1433
01:48:47,600 --> 01:48:48,960
falls under the max category

1434
01:48:48,960 --> 01:48:51,760
uh... max three hundred the miss remix

1435
01:48:51,760 --> 01:48:55,760
uh... max three hundred pack which means probably more than one max

1436
01:48:55,760 --> 01:48:59,040
uh... three hundred in there max max max stinks

1437
01:48:59,040 --> 01:49:02,120
and max three forty

1438
01:49:02,120 --> 01:49:09,120
Max Stinks? Max Stink. No, not Max Stinks, as in Max Stink, like Maximum Stink.

1439
01:49:09,120 --> 01:49:14,840
That sounds like an anti-deodorant. Like, instead of, you know, like Right Guard Max,

1440
01:49:14,840 --> 01:49:22,640
it's Max Stink. But to be fair, what I'm going to do is I'm going to download Max Stink to

1441
01:49:22,640 --> 01:49:28,240
my PSP and play it on the DDR simulator. Yeah. No, actually, no I'm not, because I'm not

1442
01:49:28,240 --> 01:49:35,920
waste that space on my PSP. Now, the other thing I was kind of curious about with PSP,

1443
01:49:35,920 --> 01:49:43,160
hypothetically, couldn't you use that little USB adapter to hypothetically use a Kinky

1444
01:49:43,160 --> 01:49:50,080
Joy to hypothetically put in a PlayStation 2 2DX controller? No. No, because the way

1445
01:49:50,080 --> 01:49:59,080
way the USB things works. However, you could, in theory, put a portable keyboard which uses

1446
01:49:59,080 --> 01:50:01,840
the infrared port and use that for BeatMania.

1447
01:50:01,840 --> 01:50:03,440
Now, there's an idea.

1448
01:50:03,440 --> 01:50:04,440
Or...

1449
01:50:04,440 --> 01:50:08,040
And it's like that one game. What was that BeatMania game, dah, dah, dah, or something

1450
01:50:08,040 --> 01:50:10,000
that they put out? It was a keyboard BeatMania game?

1451
01:50:10,000 --> 01:50:11,000
Yeah.

1452
01:50:11,000 --> 01:50:12,000
Oh, my gosh.

1453
01:50:12,000 --> 01:50:17,920
You know what's interesting, though, is the USB port, people are saying that you can't

1454
01:50:17,920 --> 01:50:21,960
really put stuff in there, um, like, you know, peripherals and stuff, but they have that

1455
01:50:21,960 --> 01:50:25,280
new talk band coming out for it, and it looks like, because the problem was they couldn't

1456
01:50:25,280 --> 01:50:29,520
get power off of the port. There was no power going through it, so that's why it's not working.

1457
01:50:29,520 --> 01:50:33,840
But I looked at the side of this port here, and there's these two little, like, um, copper,

1458
01:50:33,840 --> 01:50:39,640
uh, contact points where the power comes through. So apparently you can get power from it, and

1459
01:50:39,640 --> 01:50:45,520
therefore run devices and stuff. Um, so, I guess in theory you could hook up a dance

1460
01:50:45,520 --> 01:50:46,600
patter

1461
01:50:46,600 --> 01:50:49,320
but why would you want to but if you're going to be like home

1462
01:50:49,320 --> 01:50:53,080
can you bet just imagine for a minute holding a psp while you're dancing do

1463
01:50:53,080 --> 01:50:59,080
you do you think you know how stupid you'd look to somebody who's coming by

1464
01:50:59,080 --> 01:51:00,040
seriously

1465
01:51:00,040 --> 01:51:03,740
uh...

1466
01:51:03,740 --> 01:51:06,760
yes i i i have an idea what that look like

1467
01:51:06,760 --> 01:51:10,200
i've done with the controller before you know somebody posted

1468
01:51:10,200 --> 01:51:13,600
excuse me somebody posted on our forums over at orange launcher radio dot com which by the way

1469
01:51:13,600 --> 01:51:17,320
I'm very proud of our audience, what might I say, and I think the podcast is a large

1470
01:51:17,320 --> 01:51:20,720
part of what to thank for this, but I'm very proud of our audience overall, Sunday night

1471
01:51:20,720 --> 01:51:25,600
show audience and podcast audience, for making our forums relatively active recently in the

1472
01:51:25,600 --> 01:51:28,860
past couple of months. They've gotten relatively active. And one of the things that somebody

1473
01:51:28,860 --> 01:51:33,500
was posting about was using, now the weird thing is that the title of the post said using

1474
01:51:33,500 --> 01:51:38,760
PSP to charge the iPod. And then in the post they were talking about the PlayStation 2

1475
01:51:38,760 --> 01:51:44,400
charging an iPod. So, hypothetically, both would work, though, right? Because the PlayStation

1476
01:51:44,400 --> 01:51:48,440
2 has USB on it, and like you said, the PSP has the little power thing on it, so you could

1477
01:51:48,440 --> 01:51:52,100
use your PSP to charge your iPod, which is a really stupid idea if you think about it,

1478
01:51:52,100 --> 01:51:53,100
but it would work, right?

1479
01:51:53,100 --> 01:51:56,780
Well, the problem is that it's not a standard USB, it's the Mini-B, so you'd have to have

1480
01:51:56,780 --> 01:52:01,240
like some sort of adapter, but yes, I guess it's possible. Maybe, well, I don't know if

1481
01:52:01,240 --> 01:52:05,520
power's going directly to that all the time, I don't know, but I'd imagine it has to be

1482
01:52:05,520 --> 01:52:06,520
if it's...

1483
01:52:06,520 --> 01:52:07,520
Maybe it'd have to be in USB mode for it to work.

1484
01:52:07,520 --> 01:52:12,880
There's, like, um, on everything, there's these copper contact points by all the, um,

1485
01:52:12,880 --> 01:52:18,760
like, the AC adapter and also by the USB. It's, um, I think this is for cradle is why

1486
01:52:18,760 --> 01:52:23,680
they have that there, so you can just sit it down in something. Um, and then, of course,

1487
01:52:23,680 --> 01:52:28,320
the other one for the, um, peripherals that go into it, because they have screw points

1488
01:52:28,320 --> 01:52:34,340
where you can screw something in. Um, but, yeah, I guess you could do that, but, um,

1489
01:52:34,340 --> 01:52:36,340
Why would you want to, honestly?

1490
01:52:36,340 --> 01:52:39,340
Because people will do something just because they can.

1491
01:52:39,340 --> 01:52:45,340
Explain why people install Linux on a Billy Bass, on a Toaster, on Hello Kitty watches.

1492
01:52:45,340 --> 01:52:48,340
There is Linux on a Toaster.

1493
01:52:48,340 --> 01:52:52,340
Why do people do that, Loki? Because they can.

1494
01:52:52,340 --> 01:52:58,340
Seriously, I mean, if you figure out that you can charge your iPod using your PSP or whatever,

1495
01:52:58,340 --> 01:52:59,340
aren't you going to show that to somebody?

1496
01:52:59,340 --> 01:53:04,580
somebody, like, dude, I could charge my iPod with my PSP. That's cool.

1497
01:53:04,580 --> 01:53:07,900
First off, you never hear me say that because I'll never have an iPod.

1498
01:53:07,900 --> 01:53:12,620
Yes, I do. That's another story, but I guess. I don't

1499
01:53:12,620 --> 01:53:16,900
know. All right. Here's the status with Skype, you

1500
01:53:16,900 --> 01:53:20,220
guys. We're trying to get into Skype, but the weird thing is whenever we try, and I

1501
01:53:20,220 --> 01:53:24,620
realize I hear you guys in the chat room loud and clear saying you see us online, but I've

1502
01:53:24,620 --> 01:53:28,420
tried calling the back number, the phone number that you can call to get into us, too, and

1503
01:53:28,420 --> 01:53:32,200
not working. It's not ringing on our computer. So even if you guys tried to call us, we are

1504
01:53:32,200 --> 01:53:36,160
not seeing it. So even though you guys are seeing us logged in, Skype, we are not actually

1505
01:53:36,160 --> 01:53:40,120
there. We are trying to log in, but the problem is I'm getting caught in a loop on Skype,

1506
01:53:40,120 --> 01:53:44,320
is that I log in and then it says logging in and then kicks me back out to the log in

1507
01:53:44,320 --> 01:53:48,880
screen. So I don't know what's going on. Usually what I would do is I would just reset Skype

1508
01:53:48,880 --> 01:53:52,600
or reinstall Skype to get this to work. Problem is, guys, we're in the middle of a show. In

1509
01:53:52,600 --> 01:53:55,440
order for me to reinstall Skype, I'd have to dump all the listeners because Skype fucks

1510
01:53:55,440 --> 01:53:59,720
with your audio settings when it reinstalls itself, so that's not an option, so we may

1511
01:53:59,720 --> 01:54:04,320
be without Skype tonight. I will keep trying throughout the rest of the show, though. If

1512
01:54:04,320 --> 01:54:07,660
it doesn't work, you know, we'll do Ask Orange Lounge or something where you guys will be

1513
01:54:07,660 --> 01:54:11,380
able to interact with us, at least via the chat room, if nothing else, because we do

1514
01:54:11,380 --> 01:54:14,540
want to hear what our listeners have to say, and I want to hear about your Thanksgivings

1515
01:54:14,540 --> 01:54:17,940
and stuff. Very sorry about Skype, but this is one of those things where it's kind of

1516
01:54:17,940 --> 01:54:21,540
out of our ballpark right now, so we'll keep trying. I'm going to keep trying to hammer

1517
01:54:21,540 --> 01:54:25,700
in there and clear some stuff out and see what I can do.

1518
01:54:25,700 --> 01:54:30,140
I can't wait for Animal Crossing. Yes, Animal Crossing is what? Not next week,

1519
01:54:30,140 --> 01:54:32,740
but the week after, right? December 5th or something?

1520
01:54:32,740 --> 01:54:35,740
7th, the week of the 7th. Oh, I'm so excited.

1521
01:54:35,740 --> 01:54:39,540
It's coming out, it'll be awesome. That's gonna be the coolest thing.

1522
01:54:39,540 --> 01:54:42,060
We don't know a lot about this game, though, right? We don't know a lot about the way it's

1523
01:54:42,060 --> 01:54:44,220
really gonna work. The site launch, that's about it.

1524
01:54:44,220 --> 01:54:47,660
I played it. You played it? How? At E3?

1525
01:54:47,660 --> 01:54:54,100
So E3 answers some questions about it, but it doesn't tell us how online is going to

1526
01:54:54,100 --> 01:54:55,100
work.

1527
01:54:55,100 --> 01:54:56,100
That's really what I'm curious about.

1528
01:54:56,100 --> 01:54:59,020
Can I go into Dark Sakura's village and cut down all her trees?

1529
01:54:59,020 --> 01:55:04,180
If you want Dark Sakura to go into your village and set fire to it.

1530
01:55:04,180 --> 01:55:09,660
Am I going to be able to go into Dark Sakura's village and teach all of her villagers to

1531
01:55:09,660 --> 01:55:11,660
say, you smell like butt?

1532
01:55:11,660 --> 01:55:18,660
Hey, you had Olivia in my village saying something rather foul.

1533
01:55:18,660 --> 01:55:26,660
It was cunt, ladies and gentlemen. The word was cunt. I was sophomoric and juvenile, and I thought it was funny to get one of my Animal Crossing villagers to say cunt.

1534
01:55:26,660 --> 01:55:27,660
But...

1535
01:55:27,660 --> 01:55:34,660
She moved into your village, and then I got her back, because she was my favorite.

1536
01:55:34,660 --> 01:55:35,660
And she was foul.

1537
01:55:35,660 --> 01:55:39,660
She was going around foul-mouthed, and then her neighbor started saying it too.

1538
01:55:39,660 --> 01:55:48,660
I don't remember who moved to my town, Big Cock, but it was funny to everybody talking about Big Cock all the time.

1539
01:55:48,660 --> 01:55:52,660
We had Danville. Because of Dan.

1540
01:55:52,660 --> 01:55:59,660
Oh yeah, I remember that. You had Danville. I had just, I don't even remember what I called my town. It was Sky Place? I don't remember what it was.

1541
01:55:59,660 --> 01:56:00,660
That's sad.

1542
01:56:00,660 --> 01:56:04,660
I don't remember the name of my town.

1543
01:56:04,660 --> 01:56:07,660
I like Big Cock. I like that.

1544
01:56:07,660 --> 01:56:09,660
We have Rob on air, save any life.

1545
01:56:09,660 --> 01:56:11,660
Shut up. Shut up.

1546
01:56:13,660 --> 01:56:15,660
I hate you.

1547
01:56:21,660 --> 01:56:23,660
Wow, that was scary.

1548
01:56:23,660 --> 01:56:27,660
That didn't get all picked up on microphone, but Jamie went from laughing to laughing.

1549
01:56:30,660 --> 01:56:32,660
There she goes. Sorry.

1550
01:56:32,660 --> 01:56:34,660
You try coughing up a lung cookie.

1551
01:56:34,660 --> 01:56:36,660
It'll be all the equations it makes you.

1552
01:56:36,660 --> 01:56:40,060
Here's what I remember about Animal Crossing is that I got that

1553
01:56:40,620 --> 01:56:42,620
Olivia to say cunt she went back to your village

1554
01:56:42,740 --> 01:56:48,500
Then she went over to a guana girls village and those you that know guana girl knows that she hates that word

1555
01:56:48,940 --> 01:56:50,940
She hates that word

1556
01:56:53,900 --> 01:56:56,140
Could not get her to stop saying it

1557
01:56:57,740 --> 01:57:03,820
Was pissed at me well, she already hated me at that point, but we're past that now we can joke about it now

1558
01:57:03,820 --> 01:57:08,520
See? Ha ha! We can joke about it. But at that point, you know, it was easy to blame it on me, because, you know, yeah...

1559
01:57:08,520 --> 01:57:12,960
Although, actually, I want to say it was Rice Princess that originally got her to say that word in the first place.

1560
01:57:12,960 --> 01:57:14,960
She didn't run your game!

1561
01:57:14,960 --> 01:57:19,580
Hmm. Yeah, because Rice Princess lived in my village, because she didn't have a GameCube, she was poor.

1562
01:57:19,580 --> 01:57:22,080
So...

1563
01:57:22,080 --> 01:57:25,080
Sorry, I shouldn't...

1564
01:57:25,080 --> 01:57:30,980
I don't even know why that was funny. Uh, anyway, I'm just... Good times. Animal Crossing was good times.

1565
01:57:30,980 --> 01:57:33,780
I don't remember, I had the lesbian in my village, too.

1566
01:57:34,780 --> 01:57:36,280
Yeah, there was lesbians.

1567
01:57:36,280 --> 01:57:41,080
There was, I don't remember what she was, but she was a lesbian because she lived in the gym teacher house.

1568
01:57:41,080 --> 01:57:41,580
Mm-hmm.

1569
01:57:41,580 --> 01:57:42,780
And wore sweats all the time.

1570
01:57:42,780 --> 01:57:43,280
Mm-hmm.

1571
01:57:43,280 --> 01:57:45,680
So I put a big rainbow sign outside of her house.

1572
01:57:47,380 --> 01:57:50,980
I remember, you put the big rainbow sign and then you got her to say something like, you know, Big Dyke.

1573
01:57:50,980 --> 01:57:52,280
I don't know, no, I don't remember what it was.

1574
01:57:52,280 --> 01:57:53,280
She said something very...

1575
01:57:53,280 --> 01:57:56,880
We got her to, I've always got her to say Real Gay or something.

1576
01:57:56,880 --> 01:58:00,160
hahaha

1577
01:58:00,160 --> 01:58:02,400
that's great

1578
01:58:02,400 --> 01:58:06,040
we are thinking now I am

1579
01:58:06,040 --> 01:58:10,040
oh cool they're saying in the new animal crossing you can teach outright phrases

1580
01:58:10,040 --> 01:58:16,200
to animals rather than just sentence fragments and so I can teach my village lesbian to say that

1581
01:58:16,200 --> 01:58:17,600
nevermind

1582
01:58:17,600 --> 01:58:19,320
i.e. nevermind

1583
01:58:19,320 --> 01:58:23,940
if I say it somebody's going to YTM and do it so I can't do it

1584
01:58:23,940 --> 01:58:27,940
I fear our listener base all of a sudden.

1585
01:58:27,940 --> 01:58:31,340
Although I do love the idea of like an Orange Lounge Radio village, I don't know how we're

1586
01:58:31,340 --> 01:58:32,340
going to do it.

1587
01:58:32,340 --> 01:58:33,340
I guess it'll just have to be one of our towns.

1588
01:58:33,340 --> 01:58:37,140
We will open up during the show and just let our listeners randomly come in and harass

1589
01:58:37,140 --> 01:58:38,140
us during Orange Lounge.

1590
01:58:38,140 --> 01:58:39,140
But we'll have to recreate ourselves.

1591
01:58:39,140 --> 01:58:40,140
It'll be fun.

1592
01:58:40,140 --> 01:58:42,940
In Animal Crossing form and have our houses.

1593
01:58:42,940 --> 01:58:43,940
Totally.

1594
01:58:43,940 --> 01:58:44,940
Or maybe we'll come to your village.

1595
01:58:44,940 --> 01:58:47,940
That could be the thing is that Orange Lounge Radio, we could party crash your village.

1596
01:58:47,940 --> 01:58:51,100
Get like maybe like once a week, somebody will give us a prank code and we'll go party

1597
01:58:51,100 --> 01:58:53,180
crash in their village and destroy things.

1598
01:59:23,180 --> 01:59:26,780
t-shirt one and I just wrote O-L-R on it was my first emblem but I'm like that's

1599
01:59:26,780 --> 01:59:30,380
stupid and then like when I would get into matches randomly on the internet I

1600
01:59:30,380 --> 01:59:34,420
know nobody's gonna know what that means so now mine is a big orange heart and it

1601
01:59:34,420 --> 01:59:41,340
says in the heart I can't draw I wrote I can't draw mine I actually went and did

1602
01:59:41,340 --> 01:59:46,180
an old logo that I had designed I was gonna do I wanted to get some skull and

1603
01:59:46,180 --> 01:59:50,580
crossbones on there too but I just stuck with Loki yeah

1604
01:59:50,580 --> 01:59:55,940
Mykletof actually took his avatar on DDRFreak and put it through that little site that'll

1605
01:59:55,940 --> 01:59:59,340
show you how to turn your thing into a mari- and he said he spent like an hour and a half

1606
01:59:59,340 --> 02:00:01,480
just drawing it out pixel by pixel.

1607
02:00:01,480 --> 02:00:02,980
That is some dedication there.

1608
02:00:02,980 --> 02:00:03,980
Crazy.

1609
02:00:03,980 --> 02:00:08,660
Did you see the VG cats where they were talking about the logo on the card and it says it's

1610
02:00:08,660 --> 02:00:09,660
a penis?

1611
02:00:09,660 --> 02:00:12,660
No, it's a penis and she goes, I know.

1612
02:00:12,660 --> 02:00:17,220
I'm going to link that to the chatroom.

1613
02:00:17,220 --> 02:00:18,220
Please do.

1614
02:00:18,220 --> 02:00:19,220
That's good.

1615
02:00:19,220 --> 02:00:24,220
So we're going to go to a break, and when we come back from this break, we will reveal the winner of tonight's cage match.

1616
02:00:24,220 --> 02:00:27,220
And if we can't do Skype, I'm going to try and hammer back into Skype.

1617
02:00:27,220 --> 02:00:31,220
If we cannot do Skype, we will figure out something else to do.

1618
02:00:31,220 --> 02:00:34,220
We'll do some Mass Corners lounge where we'll get into the FUs of the week.

1619
02:00:34,220 --> 02:00:36,220
Something.

1620
02:00:36,220 --> 02:00:42,220
Or, you know, maybe we'll just have to rely on our quick wit to fill some show.

1621
02:00:42,220 --> 02:00:44,220
So we'll see what happens.

1622
02:00:44,220 --> 02:00:49,180
In this break, I want to do a little bit of bakwa because I I need some Korean music

1623
02:00:49,180 --> 02:00:53,180
So we're going to do Bequia. We'll be back after this with more Orange Andrea.

1624
02:01:19,180 --> 02:01:21,180
Oh

1625
02:02:49,180 --> 02:02:55,180
Thought I heard you talking so quickly

1626
02:02:56,180 --> 02:03:03,180
I turn on the lights, the cv's and the radio

1627
02:03:03,180 --> 02:03:09,180
Still I can't escape the doses of you

1628
02:03:10,180 --> 02:03:17,180
What is happening to it all, crazy something

1629
02:03:17,180 --> 02:03:23,180
Where is the light that I recognize?

1630
02:03:23,180 --> 02:03:28,180
Gone away, but I won't cry till yesterday

1631
02:03:28,180 --> 02:03:38,180
There's an ordinary world somehow I have to find

1632
02:03:38,180 --> 02:03:46,180
And as I try to make my way to the ordinary world

1633
02:03:46,180 --> 02:03:52,180
I will learn to survive

1634
02:07:16,180 --> 02:07:18,180
Daddy, do you want it?

1635
02:07:18,180 --> 02:07:20,180
Daddy, do you want it?

1636
02:07:20,180 --> 02:07:22,180
Daddy, do you want it?

1637
02:07:22,180 --> 02:07:24,180
Hello?

1638
02:07:24,180 --> 02:07:26,180
Hello, is this thing on? Testing?

1639
02:07:26,180 --> 02:07:28,180
Testing 1-2?

1640
02:07:28,180 --> 02:07:30,180
I'm looking in the index

1641
02:07:30,180 --> 02:07:32,180
but I don't see anything for how to run a radio show.

1642
02:07:32,180 --> 02:07:34,180
Hello?

1643
02:07:34,180 --> 02:07:36,180
I don't understand this.

1644
02:07:36,180 --> 02:07:38,180
Does this thing work?

1645
02:07:38,180 --> 02:07:40,180
This thing reads like stereo instructions.

1646
02:07:40,180 --> 02:07:42,180
Is this on? What the hell?

1647
02:07:42,180 --> 02:07:46,180
Orange Lounge Radio broke down Ghetto Bimani Radio.

1648
02:07:46,180 --> 02:07:48,180
What the f**k?

1649
02:07:50,180 --> 02:07:53,180
You're telling me broke down Ghetto Bimani Radio. We can't get our Skype tour tonight.

1650
02:07:53,180 --> 02:07:57,180
I think it's going to be a wash for Skype tonight because I'm getting the same problem when I get back in there.

1651
02:07:57,180 --> 02:08:02,180
I had one of our listeners try calling us during the break there trying to get in. No worky.

1652
02:08:02,180 --> 02:08:06,180
So I think Skype might be down tonight. We will keep trying. I'm not going to lose hope.

1653
02:08:06,180 --> 02:08:11,180
If we can fit in even one guy. It caught your whooping cough or something.

1654
02:08:11,180 --> 02:08:14,820
If we could fit in even one call before the end of the show, we will do it, but you know,

1655
02:08:14,820 --> 02:08:19,340
this show existed for like a year and a half before we ever had Skype, so we will, of course

1656
02:08:19,340 --> 02:08:23,420
then again the show is only two hours then too, but we will find a way to get through

1657
02:08:23,420 --> 02:08:25,980
this somehow.

1658
02:08:25,980 --> 02:08:30,420
And I realize you guys are seeing us online, I assure you guys, even though we are somehow

1659
02:08:30,420 --> 02:08:34,460
showing us online, we are not getting the pop-up box that shows us we have a call, therefore

1660
02:08:34,460 --> 02:08:36,180
we cannot take your call.

1661
02:08:36,180 --> 02:08:40,100
We thought about patching through Dark Sakura's laptop, but unfortunately that is not an option

1662
02:08:40,100 --> 02:08:43,400
either because we don't have the right cable to plug into our mixing board.

1663
02:08:43,400 --> 02:08:48,200
Sucks to be us, doesn't it? Oh well. Moving on then, let's talk about who won

1664
02:08:48,200 --> 02:08:51,640
tonight's cage match. Don't you want to know who won tonight's cage match?

1665
02:08:51,640 --> 02:08:57,380
Slightly. Oh boy, do you. I wish it could, I wish I could say it was a close call

1666
02:08:57,380 --> 02:09:00,940
tonight, but unfortunately it really wasn't. One song really blew the other

1667
02:09:00,940 --> 02:09:04,680
ones out of the water. Tonight's winner was...

1668
02:09:04,680 --> 02:09:11,000
I told you I can't go wrong if I pick Damon.

1669
02:09:11,000 --> 02:09:12,000
You know why you won?

1670
02:09:12,000 --> 02:09:16,840
Because Roz was rallying the troops in the chat room for you, I think, so that was a

1671
02:09:16,840 --> 02:09:21,000
big part of the reason why I think you got it.

1672
02:09:21,000 --> 02:09:22,000
So good job.

1673
02:09:22,000 --> 02:09:25,780
Blur wins, and we'll go into rotation on our Bomani video game music program, which by

1674
02:09:25,780 --> 02:09:30,520
the way I updated in some capacity this week, and we're going to take a look at the video

1675
02:09:30,520 --> 02:09:34,660
game music portion very soon, but Bomani got a little bit of facelift, and that is all

1676
02:09:34,660 --> 02:09:38,660
all based on your scores that come up in the, for those of you that listen through Live

1677
02:09:38,660 --> 02:09:43,220
365 and not through iTunes, you get little thumbs up and thumbs down icons where you

1678
02:09:43,220 --> 02:09:46,740
can actually, whoa, my, stupid microphone. You get little thumbs up and thumbs down icons

1679
02:09:46,740 --> 02:09:52,260
where you can actually rate the songs as they play. So we actually took out a couple of

1680
02:09:52,260 --> 02:09:56,420
the Romani songs that were very low rated, some of the stuff from Ultramix 2 and some

1681
02:09:56,420 --> 02:10:01,140
of the old, old songs we just kind of flushed out of there and put in some of the good Ultramix

1682
02:10:01,140 --> 02:10:08,300
3 songs and Happy Sky and some other stuff too. I threw in a new Castlevania song for

1683
02:10:08,300 --> 02:10:11,140
good measure just because I was like, this song should be in rotation. Let's not go on

1684
02:10:11,140 --> 02:10:21,060
a new one in there. Enjoy. This microphone is pissing me off. Anyway, I hate this mic.

1685
02:10:21,060 --> 02:10:26,300
That's what we need to use our $25 just to get it on as a replacement mic. We need to

1686
02:10:26,300 --> 02:10:30,180
actually put down some money and get good mics. We should invest it and then in the

1687
02:10:30,180 --> 02:10:36,560
year we could have a good mic. That microphone that you're using there would be about what

1688
02:10:36,560 --> 02:10:41,780
we could afford if we invested the $25. That's one that Angel very kindly donated to us and

1689
02:10:41,780 --> 02:10:44,300
that's... You know, this rear shaft thing's been lasting

1690
02:10:44,300 --> 02:10:48,300
pretty long. Yeah, that one's not bad. I just had to pick

1691
02:10:48,300 --> 02:10:52,860
it up. You know what? I'm about ready to go just

1692
02:10:52,860 --> 02:10:58,380
buy my own top dollar mic. That would be nice. That's a great mic. It

1693
02:10:58,380 --> 02:11:04,620
really is. The one you're using is fabulous, but it costs this much times eight.

1694
02:11:04,620 --> 02:11:09,620
It costs that much times eight. That's how much that costs, according to Angel.

1695
02:11:09,620 --> 02:11:19,620
So, yeah. And I see some people in the room bitching about my microphone's suggestion

1696
02:11:19,620 --> 02:11:23,220
to turn up the mixing board's mic boost until the microphone works. Unfortunately, that

1697
02:11:23,220 --> 02:11:27,540
doesn't work right, because the problem with this microphone is it's what we call, I think

1698
02:11:27,540 --> 02:11:32,580
they call it unidirectional, which means it only works if the microphone is pointing in

1699
02:11:32,580 --> 02:11:36,060
one particular direction. And it's really good for reporters who are trying to interview

1700
02:11:36,060 --> 02:11:40,420
someone who don't want to get all that background noise. But the problem is, usually what you

1701
02:11:40,420 --> 02:11:44,700
get is a cardio-shaped microphone, which is like a heart-shaped audio pattern, or you

1702
02:11:44,700 --> 02:11:49,640
have a, I think, omni-directional microphone, which is, you can pick up sound in all directions.

1703
02:11:49,640 --> 02:11:53,500
And Dark Soccer and Loki have omni-directional microphones, so no matter which way they're

1704
02:11:53,500 --> 02:11:57,060
holding the microphone, it's picking up their sound. Unfortunately, with this microphone,

1705
02:11:57,060 --> 02:12:02,880
If I turn it just a little bit too far one direction, you suddenly lose the voice and

1706
02:12:02,880 --> 02:12:04,120
you don't hear me as well.

1707
02:12:04,120 --> 02:12:08,280
So I have to talk specifically into one part of this microphone or it doesn't work.

1708
02:12:08,280 --> 02:12:11,260
And the problem is that I'm not necessarily used to this microphone, so that's why you

1709
02:12:11,260 --> 02:12:12,840
get a lot of weird sound out of this.

1710
02:12:12,840 --> 02:12:13,840
So go figure.

1711
02:12:13,840 --> 02:12:18,480
You still sound more normal than I do.

1712
02:12:18,480 --> 02:12:19,480
To some extent.

1713
02:12:19,480 --> 02:12:23,080
And then people are saying in the chat room, oh, my headset mic only cost me $8.

1714
02:12:23,080 --> 02:12:27,080
The problem is that we used to use those headsets in the early, early days.

1715
02:12:27,080 --> 02:12:31,080
Hey, and the headsets that I bought were expensive.

1716
02:12:31,080 --> 02:12:34,080
And they were call center headsets.

1717
02:12:34,080 --> 02:12:36,080
Yeah, and the problem is they kind of sounded like call center.

1718
02:12:36,080 --> 02:12:38,080
They didn't, they were good. They worked at a time.

1719
02:12:38,080 --> 02:12:39,080
They were free.

1720
02:12:39,080 --> 02:12:42,080
But remember that very, very, very first mic we had?

1721
02:12:42,080 --> 02:12:43,080
It was the guest microphone.

1722
02:12:43,080 --> 02:12:45,080
It was this little tiny $10 microphone

1723
02:12:45,080 --> 02:12:47,080
that sounded like you were talking out of two Dixie cups and a string.

1724
02:12:47,080 --> 02:12:48,080
Yeah.

1725
02:12:48,080 --> 02:12:49,080
I wish I had.

1726
02:12:49,080 --> 02:12:51,080
What happened to the boom mic?

1727
02:12:51,080 --> 02:12:52,080
The boom mic?

1728
02:12:52,080 --> 02:12:53,080
We had the big...

1729
02:12:53,080 --> 02:12:56,080
Oh, the boom mic! That's at Loki's house.

1730
02:12:56,080 --> 02:12:57,080
Yeah, it's still my house.

1731
02:12:57,080 --> 02:13:01,080
Yeah, the boom mic was our idea, because we used to have a lot of sidebar conversations.

1732
02:13:01,080 --> 02:13:06,080
Because in the old place, in the old studio, we would have like ten people that could fit in the studio.

1733
02:13:06,080 --> 02:13:08,080
It was an ambient mic.

1734
02:13:08,080 --> 02:13:14,080
Yeah, and the boom mic was supposed to pick up sidebar conversations, and it was to kind of encourage people to shut the eff up while we're trying to do a show.

1735
02:13:14,080 --> 02:13:18,080
Well, it was supposed to be so you could hear people yelling in the background.

1736
02:13:18,080 --> 02:13:20,080
Oh, that too.

1737
02:13:20,080 --> 02:13:22,400
And it worked pretty good for what we had.

1738
02:13:22,400 --> 02:13:24,880
You know, it worked okay. It was kind of hit and miss.

1739
02:13:24,880 --> 02:13:28,160
It was hidden, see, so no one knew what it was so they couldn't talk into it.

1740
02:13:28,160 --> 02:13:30,720
Exactly. It was good.

1741
02:13:30,720 --> 02:13:32,320
All right, um...

1742
02:13:32,320 --> 02:13:36,000
I think what we'll do now, because I'm feeling a little angsty about the Skypline not working,

1743
02:13:36,000 --> 02:13:40,960
is I think now would be a very good time for us to, uh, get into the FUs of the week.

1744
02:13:40,960 --> 02:13:43,040
I don't know. Do you think that's a good idea, DarkSakura?

1745
02:13:43,040 --> 02:13:45,840
Because I know I'm certainly feeling the angst. I don't know about you.

1746
02:13:45,840 --> 02:13:46,960
Completely agree.

1747
02:13:46,960 --> 02:13:47,920
Okay.

1748
02:13:47,920 --> 02:13:49,640
and uh...

1749
02:13:49,640 --> 02:13:52,660
where it's not the f he's the week and uh... dark soccer why is it we do the

1750
02:13:52,660 --> 02:13:56,040
f he's the week by the way you guys can send them now dark soccer why is that we

1751
02:13:56,040 --> 02:14:03,040
do the f he's the week every single week

1752
02:14:09,960 --> 02:14:11,960
i haven't heard that a while

1753
02:14:11,960 --> 02:14:16,400
the f he goes toward whatever the disease of the week is

1754
02:14:16,400 --> 02:14:21,320
Apparently I went from a cold, to a sinus infection, to bronchitis, to pneumonia, to

1755
02:14:21,320 --> 02:14:26,560
whipping cough, and I kind of miss knowing what my voice sounds like other than listening

1756
02:14:26,560 --> 02:14:29,880
to our old bumpers on the station.

1757
02:14:29,880 --> 02:14:35,480
And F.U. took me getting lotion sick from playing We Love Katamari.

1758
02:14:35,480 --> 02:14:39,880
And F.U. goes from me not having any more time off for the rest of the year, and also

1759
02:14:39,880 --> 02:14:43,560
having to put off my trip to London until 2007.

1760
02:14:43,560 --> 02:14:48,560
And also to whoever that was that double parked in your parking lot, Rob, because they suck.

1761
02:14:48,560 --> 02:14:50,560
They suck quite a bit!

1762
02:14:50,560 --> 02:14:54,560
And also if you two are not having any hot tea right now.

1763
02:14:54,560 --> 02:14:57,560
Good.

1764
02:14:57,560 --> 02:15:01,560
Let's go over to Loki and see where his angst is.

1765
02:15:01,560 --> 02:15:05,560
My angst is with games being boring.

1766
02:15:05,560 --> 02:15:12,560
Like for example, Shadow Colossus. I'm getting quite bored with that game really quick.

1767
02:15:12,560 --> 02:15:14,560
So, yeah, I have to sell that back now.

1768
02:15:14,560 --> 02:15:18,560
Fuck you, there's Microsoft for not selling out quite enough Xbox 360s.

1769
02:15:18,560 --> 02:15:20,560
Yeah, and they want to drive a pipe. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1770
02:15:20,560 --> 02:15:23,560
You're not going to do that by really cryptic commercials.

1771
02:15:23,560 --> 02:15:26,560
You need a commercial that screams, wow, this is kickass.

1772
02:15:26,560 --> 02:15:28,560
You know, you got to get it.

1773
02:15:28,560 --> 02:15:32,560
Watching people throw water balloons does not scream, wow, this is kickass.

1774
02:15:32,560 --> 02:15:34,560
Or watching people jump rope, no, that is not kickass.

1775
02:15:34,560 --> 02:15:36,560
That tells me, go outside.

1776
02:15:36,560 --> 02:15:38,560
That's what that says.

1777
02:15:38,560 --> 02:15:41,560
So, you might be marketing that to the wrong people.

1778
02:15:41,560 --> 02:15:59,560
I didn't have a problem today. I never have a problem with McDonald's and my orders.

1779
02:15:59,560 --> 02:16:04,560
Well, they couldn't figure out how to run an ATM card, apparently, because they just did it in the machine, kind of like,

1780
02:16:04,560 --> 02:16:06,560
and went,

1781
02:16:06,560 --> 02:16:08,560
couldn't figure it out, so.

1782
02:16:08,560 --> 02:16:10,560
I'd do it myself.

1783
02:16:10,560 --> 02:16:13,560
I have tea bags if you want some hot tea.

1784
02:16:13,560 --> 02:16:14,560
You sure?

1785
02:16:14,560 --> 02:16:15,560
I want my herbs from home.

1786
02:16:15,560 --> 02:16:16,560
Peppermint.

1787
02:16:16,560 --> 02:16:18,560
I only have shitty Lipton, sorry.

1788
02:16:18,560 --> 02:16:20,560
I have shitty Lipton green tea, too.

1789
02:16:20,560 --> 02:16:24,560
I've been making Peppermint and White Willow tea.

1790
02:16:24,560 --> 02:16:25,560
Oh, that sounds good.

1791
02:16:25,560 --> 02:16:26,560
White Willow is nasty shit.

1792
02:16:26,560 --> 02:16:28,560
Egyptian licorice is my favorite, absolutely.

1793
02:16:28,560 --> 02:16:35,560
I'm going to be online playing Mario Kart DS after this show, briefly, between the show and the podcast.

1794
02:16:35,560 --> 02:16:37,560
You should get some friend codes.

1795
02:16:37,560 --> 02:16:41,560
I have friend codes, but I could never catch anyone online.

1796
02:16:41,560 --> 02:16:44,560
So just let them know and give them fair warning.

1797
02:16:45,560 --> 02:16:46,560
Alright, my turn.

1798
02:16:50,560 --> 02:16:55,560
If you do the fact that I have to go back to work tomorrow after four days of not having to work,

1799
02:16:55,560 --> 02:16:58,560
because you kind of get used to not working and then you have to go back to work.

1800
02:16:58,560 --> 02:17:02,060
Tomorrow's going to kind of be a busy day, too, just because it's like one of those things,

1801
02:17:02,060 --> 02:17:06,560
you know, especially when you're kind of in the role that I play at my organization,

1802
02:17:06,560 --> 02:17:08,560
it's kind of like I've got to find my groove.

1803
02:17:08,560 --> 02:17:11,060
Rob's got to get his groove back, like Stella.

1804
02:17:11,060 --> 02:17:15,560
I've got to get my groove back, and it's not something that's going to click at 8 o'clock in the morning tomorrow,

1805
02:17:15,560 --> 02:17:17,560
so I'm going to be very groggy and bitchy tomorrow.

1806
02:17:17,560 --> 02:17:21,060
As for the fact that I way overslept this weekend, I mean, seriously,

1807
02:17:21,060 --> 02:17:24,560
I've been sleeping, like, at least 10 hours a night every night this week,

1808
02:17:24,560 --> 02:17:28,940
that is not good for me but it feels so good I'm so relaxed now so maybe I

1809
02:17:28,940 --> 02:17:32,820
needed it because ten hours of sleep a night is much better than the like four

1810
02:17:32,820 --> 02:17:36,660
and six hours a night I was getting previously so I certainly paid for it

1811
02:17:36,660 --> 02:17:41,060
this break I think if I could have just hibernated for the past four days it

1812
02:17:41,060 --> 02:17:48,420
would have been great an F you to the fact that I was an F you to the fact

1813
02:17:48,420 --> 02:17:52,220
that I couldn't get an Xbox 360 even if I wanted one and an F you to the fact

1814
02:17:52,220 --> 02:17:56,540
that a lot of video games are $50, like the new ones. Like, $50 is a lot of money. $60.

1815
02:17:56,540 --> 02:18:00,540
Well, yeah, yeah, the Xbox 360 is like $60, but even like, you know, current-gen platforms

1816
02:18:00,540 --> 02:18:05,460
are $50. Sometimes, if you're lucky, $30 or $40, but Dragon Quest VIII sent me back $50,

1817
02:18:05,460 --> 02:18:09,780
so it's kinda like, boy oh boy, I better get $100 of playtime out of that game or something

1818
02:18:09,780 --> 02:18:15,060
to make it worth it. Otherwise, I'm gonna be pissed. Yeah. So, F you do expensive things.

1819
02:18:15,060 --> 02:18:21,780
That's not fun. Alright, let's go to the chatroom FUs, of which I'm sure there are plenty this

1820
02:18:21,780 --> 02:18:29,500
week. Let's see what's going on there. Ah, let's see. Rini wants to give a big, huge F.U. to

1821
02:18:29,500 --> 02:18:34,200
Best Buy at McDonald's for making me gather $21, Best Buy dollars, and when I

1822
02:18:34,200 --> 02:18:39,220
finally get to use them on UltraMix 3, the website, lolatloki, the damn game

1823
02:18:39,220 --> 02:18:43,500
gets on backorder, so I had to buy at full price at GameStop and get a refund.

1824
02:18:43,500 --> 02:18:47,980
Another F.U. to the manager at a nearby EB Games, where I was considering buying

1825
02:18:47,980 --> 02:18:53,300
UltraMix3 when he hangs up because he thinks I'm a rival manager, letting him know that the game is out already.

1826
02:18:53,300 --> 02:18:54,800
What?

1827
02:18:54,800 --> 02:18:59,600
And my last F.U. to a Wasp that took four hits with a large towel to take down.

1828
02:19:02,600 --> 02:19:05,100
My next F.U. comes from Sephiroth1215.

1829
02:19:05,100 --> 02:19:08,200
F.U. to my teacher giving work over Thanksgiving.

1830
02:19:08,200 --> 02:19:11,740
Oh, remember? Remember back in the day when we were in high school,

1831
02:19:11,740 --> 02:19:14,580
and those bitches would give us homework over like Christmas break?

1832
02:19:14,580 --> 02:19:17,080
It's like, read this book!

1833
02:19:17,080 --> 02:19:19,080
I really enjoyed reading books.

1834
02:19:19,080 --> 02:19:23,080
I enjoyed reading books too, but not the crap that our teachers assigned us.

1835
02:19:23,080 --> 02:19:25,080
I liked reading contemporary stuff.

1836
02:19:25,080 --> 02:19:31,080
And I remember to this day the book I hated that I had to read in high school was Dandelion Wine.

1837
02:19:31,080 --> 02:19:33,080
Hated that book.

1838
02:19:33,080 --> 02:19:35,080
It was so stupid.

1839
02:19:35,080 --> 02:19:36,080
That book?

1840
02:19:36,080 --> 02:19:38,080
Dandelion Wine is what it was called.

1841
02:19:38,080 --> 02:19:39,080
You know what I was reading?

1842
02:19:39,080 --> 02:19:40,080
No.

1843
02:19:40,080 --> 02:19:41,080
The Inferno.

1844
02:19:41,080 --> 02:19:42,080
That's cool.

1845
02:19:42,080 --> 02:19:44,080
And The Odyssey.

1846
02:19:44,080 --> 02:19:46,080
They did give us some good choices.

1847
02:19:46,080 --> 02:19:50,080
I did a book report on the Bible.

1848
02:19:50,080 --> 02:19:52,080
For real?

1849
02:19:52,080 --> 02:19:54,080
They let you do that in school?

1850
02:19:54,080 --> 02:19:57,080
They had no choice. I wrote my book report.

1851
02:19:57,080 --> 02:19:58,080
Look at the book!

1852
02:19:58,080 --> 02:20:00,080
You do stink.

1853
02:20:00,080 --> 02:20:02,080
What was the book?

1854
02:20:02,080 --> 02:20:04,080
1984, but our class didn't do that one.

1855
02:20:04,080 --> 02:20:06,080
We did Brave New World, which was just as weird.

1856
02:20:06,080 --> 02:20:08,080
You know, we did Catcher in the Rye, which was cool.

1857
02:20:08,080 --> 02:20:10,080
I enjoyed doing Catcher in the Rye.

1858
02:20:10,080 --> 02:20:12,080
I hated the Grapes of Wrath.

1859
02:20:12,080 --> 02:20:15,080
Fuck the Grapes of Wrath. Oh my god, we ought to do that one too.

1860
02:20:15,080 --> 02:20:18,120
Anyway, Sephiroth1215 also says,

1861
02:20:18,120 --> 02:20:20,880
and F.U. to Tecmo for pushing back DOA4

1862
02:20:20,880 --> 02:20:23,720
because I won another 360 game that is actually good.

1863
02:20:23,720 --> 02:20:25,320
Oh, and Sephiroth1215 would like to say,

1864
02:20:25,320 --> 02:20:27,280
he's actually in college, not high school.

1865
02:20:30,280 --> 02:20:32,720
Look at Mike, same thing with college, seriously.

1866
02:20:36,040 --> 02:20:38,040
Darkknight says, F.U. to Black Friday,

1867
02:20:38,040 --> 02:20:40,400
F.U. to losing my stylus, I had to buy a new one,

1868
02:20:40,400 --> 02:20:42,720
F.U. to being single for 18 years.

1869
02:20:42,720 --> 02:20:48,720
I would buy him a horn. Seriously, I mean, that's why I'm kidding. Hold on to it!

1870
02:20:48,720 --> 02:20:51,720
My stylus got eaten by my couch.

1871
02:20:51,720 --> 02:20:54,720
I have a spare.

1872
02:20:54,720 --> 02:20:58,720
Dan bought me a silver one that matches my DS.

1873
02:20:58,720 --> 02:21:02,720
Um...

1874
02:21:02,720 --> 02:21:07,720
You know you can buy those styluses in, like, the little color packs so you can have, like, a purple stylus?

1875
02:21:07,720 --> 02:21:13,720
We have the two packs. We have the black one, the blue one, and the silver one.

1876
02:21:13,720 --> 02:21:14,720
Sorry, I have the silver one.

1877
02:21:14,720 --> 02:21:15,720
I want a purple one.

1878
02:21:17,720 --> 02:21:19,720
God, I hate you, microphone. Purple's cool.

1879
02:21:20,720 --> 02:21:21,720
Moving on.

1880
02:21:21,720 --> 02:21:23,720
I'm back used to the microphone.

1881
02:21:23,720 --> 02:21:24,720
Seriously.

1882
02:21:24,720 --> 02:21:28,720
Roz wants to say an F.U. to Graham Coxon, that sexy bitch,

1883
02:21:28,720 --> 02:21:33,720
delayed his new album release from Fall 2005 to March 16th, 2006.

1884
02:21:33,720 --> 02:21:35,720
Nice way to work in that plug, by the way.

1885
02:21:35,720 --> 02:21:41,320
Ron Chan says F you to people that drop out of races on Mario Kart DS. Take your beatings like a man

1886
02:21:42,600 --> 02:21:49,300
Neo dude zero says F you to crappy link says USB internet adapters. I've been in and out of both show and chat all night

1887
02:21:51,480 --> 02:21:55,460
Vander C says F you to Jamie for slapping me with the trout. I don't like trout

1888
02:21:57,680 --> 02:21:59,680
Tell him to stay tuned for my response

1889
02:21:59,680 --> 02:22:06,680
You need to slap him with a grilled salmon, or slap him with a chili bath.

1890
02:22:06,680 --> 02:22:08,680
Marco is for trout.

1891
02:22:08,680 --> 02:22:09,680
I know.

1892
02:22:09,680 --> 02:22:17,680
Tomo-kun says, fuck me neglecting this show and the podcast for weeks upon weeks upon weeks.

1893
02:22:17,680 --> 02:22:23,680
I agree. F you. Oh, and fuck you whoever sends me the same piece of spam.

1894
02:22:23,680 --> 02:22:30,160
PopeHanda21 says F you to my ex boyfriend for being emo and F you to the world's ugliest

1895
02:22:30,160 --> 02:22:32,160
dog.

1896
02:22:32,160 --> 02:22:34,640
Sakurina says F you to stupid babies on the bus.

1897
02:22:34,640 --> 02:22:38,640
The fucking mom decides to bring her baby in a stroller on the busiest bus in town filled

1898
02:22:38,640 --> 02:22:43,520
with tons of students yet she bitches about us nearly killing her baby with our taking

1899
02:22:43,520 --> 02:22:44,520
space.

1900
02:22:44,520 --> 02:22:47,200
Yeah well get a fucking babysitter bitch you're the one who's stupid enough to bring your

1901
02:22:47,200 --> 02:22:50,240
baby on a bus which is occupied by students headed to school.

1902
02:22:50,240 --> 02:22:51,240
Fuck you.

1903
02:22:51,240 --> 02:22:57,280
ColorOfSakura says, F you to not getting enough hours at work, F you to Mario Kart DS's lack

1904
02:22:57,280 --> 02:23:03,880
of good wifi interface, F you to the Xbox 360, F you to sickness, F you to getting my

1905
02:23:03,880 --> 02:23:08,800
2DX controller in the mail and it being broken.

1906
02:23:08,800 --> 02:23:12,360
Legend of Zaku says, F you to not investing $400 earlier this year, it's like getting

1907
02:23:12,360 --> 02:23:17,120
Xbox 360 for me to sell on eBay now, F you to Sake not being as strong as I thought it

1908
02:23:17,120 --> 02:23:21,320
would be. F you to fucking ants that invaded my box of Rice-A-Roni, thus

1909
02:23:21,320 --> 02:23:26,360
forcing me to ditch that box and use up another... Oh, to be in college again. F you

1910
02:23:26,360 --> 02:23:30,260
to all other game stores for trying to offer me pennies for Madden 06 and NBA

1911
02:23:30,260 --> 02:23:34,880
Live 06. Lucky me, I knew this place around my way that gave me $50 for both

1912
02:23:34,880 --> 02:23:40,760
of them. And Nintendo Maniac would like to say... Oh, Nintendo Maniac 64 says F you

1913
02:23:40,760 --> 02:23:43,880
to the weather for there being lots of snow and a possible snow day on

1914
02:23:43,880 --> 02:23:48,520
Thanksgiving week. FU to my computer for locking up a few minutes ago, preventing me from not

1915
02:23:48,520 --> 02:23:54,760
knowing its FU time. FU to myself for putting a knot in my last FU when it was supposed

1916
02:23:54,760 --> 02:23:59,120
to be there. What? It wasn't supposed to be there. FU to myself for building a DS Lego

1917
02:23:59,120 --> 02:24:04,520
charging deck which took up my charger and I had to partially disassemble it to get my

1918
02:24:04,520 --> 02:24:10,280
charger out so I could play, uh, I keep wanting to say Mortal Kombat, Mario Kart DS without

1919
02:24:10,280 --> 02:24:17,280
my DS's battery dying.

1920
02:24:40,280 --> 02:24:43,280
But it works good! Works good for charging.

1921
02:24:45,280 --> 02:24:49,280
Can you use hot glue and you put it together and it'll never fall apart again?

1922
02:24:49,280 --> 02:24:56,280
Yeah, and then you'll never be able to get that stupid charger thing out of there, because you basically, you hold the wire in place with Legos or something underneath it.

1923
02:24:56,280 --> 02:24:57,280
Yeah.

1924
02:24:57,280 --> 02:24:58,280
Not fun.

1925
02:24:58,280 --> 02:25:00,280
It's stuck in there pretty good.

1926
02:25:00,280 --> 02:25:03,280
That's cool though. I like that DS charging station. It was a good idea.

1927
02:25:03,280 --> 02:25:08,780
I'll have to find... I have the specs on my computer still.

1928
02:25:08,780 --> 02:25:12,780
Post those. It was fun. Good times.

1929
02:25:12,780 --> 02:25:16,780
Alright, I think what we're going to do is we're going to go to a break,

1930
02:25:16,780 --> 02:25:21,280
and when we come back we might do some Ask Orange Lounge if the Skype line's not working,

1931
02:25:21,280 --> 02:25:25,780
and some other stories, whatever tickles our fancy when we come back after this break.

1932
02:25:25,780 --> 02:25:29,780
And in this break, more Bhumani potpourri, because we can.

1933
02:25:29,780 --> 02:25:32,780
And we'll start it off with an old school Beatmania song.

1934
02:25:32,780 --> 02:25:35,500
We're going to do Total Recall.

1935
02:25:35,500 --> 02:25:38,140
We'll be back with more Orange Lounge Radio right after this.

1936
02:26:38,140 --> 02:27:06,140
I know you've worked across the street and you've made it to breakfast or a picnic

1937
02:27:06,140 --> 02:27:08,780
Someday that will mean I'm thinking we'll do something more

1938
02:27:08,780 --> 02:27:12,140
I hide behind my magazine, then I see a world come by

1939
02:27:12,140 --> 02:27:15,900
I'm not ready to be seen, I'll just stick right here and then I'll be fine

1940
02:27:28,460 --> 02:27:34,780
I'll take advantage of the feeling in me lately

1941
02:27:34,780 --> 02:27:36,780
I need my time

1942
02:27:37,780 --> 02:27:41,780
Yeah, I don't want you to leave me

1943
02:27:41,780 --> 02:27:54,780
Can't take a, can't take a home Can't take a home, can't take a home

1944
02:30:24,780 --> 02:30:31,780
Let's go right to later

1945
02:30:31,780 --> 02:30:34,780
Yeah, you're Captain Jack

1946
02:30:34,780 --> 02:30:37,780
Bring me back to Rainbow Track

1947
02:30:37,780 --> 02:30:40,780
Give me blood in my hand

1948
02:30:40,780 --> 02:30:43,780
I wanna be your shooting man

1949
02:30:43,780 --> 02:30:44,780
I wanna be your shooting man

1950
02:30:44,780 --> 02:30:47,780
I wanna be your shooting man

1951
02:30:47,780 --> 02:30:49,780
I wanna be your shooting man

1952
02:30:49,780 --> 02:30:52,780
Give me a gun in my hand

1953
02:30:52,780 --> 02:30:55,780
I wanna be your shooting man

1954
02:30:55,780 --> 02:30:57,780
Left by left

1955
02:30:57,780 --> 02:31:00,780
The military staff

1956
02:31:00,780 --> 02:31:03,780
The airborne craft

1957
02:31:03,780 --> 02:31:06,780
The summoning is the best

1958
02:31:06,780 --> 02:31:09,780
Go left or right, don't pick up the gun

1959
02:31:09,780 --> 02:31:12,780
Go left or right, go left

1960
02:31:12,780 --> 02:31:14,780
Go left or right, don't pick up the gun

1961
02:31:14,780 --> 02:31:17,780
Go left or right, go left

1962
02:31:47,780 --> 02:31:58,500
Go left, go right, go figure set, go left, go right, go left.

1963
02:31:58,500 --> 02:32:04,700
Gaming radio, so uncensored that even Tom Brokaw could get a job with us.

1964
02:32:04,700 --> 02:32:06,900
Uh, Mooch, uh, Moochawky.

1965
02:32:06,900 --> 02:32:07,900
Orange Lounge Radio.

1966
02:32:07,900 --> 02:32:08,900
Tag's gone.

1967
02:32:08,900 --> 02:32:15,820
Back, boys and girls, with more Orange Lounge Radio, and a broke-ass Skype line, so we have

1968
02:32:15,820 --> 02:32:17,900
No callers tonight.

1969
02:32:17,900 --> 02:32:21,860
God, thank God we didn't have any interviews or anything scheduled tonight. Thank God.

1970
02:32:21,860 --> 02:32:23,940
We'd be really screwed.

1971
02:32:23,940 --> 02:32:28,380
Um, so, sorry guys, we can't, uh, get you guys in on the Skype line, so, um, we're not gonna be

1972
02:32:28,380 --> 02:32:32,380
able to do, um, some calls tonight. We'll try one more time before the end of show, although

1973
02:32:32,380 --> 02:32:34,980
I somehow highly doubt it's gonna work.

1974
02:32:34,980 --> 02:32:38,640
And, apologize to those of you guys that were waiting to call in, but you know what?

1975
02:32:38,640 --> 02:32:41,580
Shit happens.

1976
02:32:41,580 --> 02:32:47,100
Of course, next week we'll be back with another episode of Orange Launch Radio Live, and all

1977
02:32:47,100 --> 02:32:48,100
of us will be here.

1978
02:32:48,100 --> 02:32:50,700
Maybe we'll have some special guests next week, I don't know.

1979
02:32:50,700 --> 02:32:54,380
We've got to talk some of our buddies into coming on over to the show.

1980
02:32:54,380 --> 02:32:58,660
Don't forget, we also have, excuse me, other live programming on Orange Launch Radio all

1981
02:32:58,660 --> 02:32:59,660
week long.

1982
02:32:59,660 --> 02:33:07,380
Monday nights, X-to-Verse Case of the Mondays, which airs at 7 o'clock.

1983
02:33:07,380 --> 02:33:10,740
It's not really a show about gaming, although he'll talk about games once in a while.

1984
02:33:10,740 --> 02:33:15,180
It's more of one of those things like, extra fresh your buddy, and he'll tell you the answer

1985
02:33:15,180 --> 02:33:16,180
to something straight up.

1986
02:33:16,180 --> 02:33:20,500
He will just, you know, he doesn't hold back, and it's definitely an R-rated show.

1987
02:33:20,500 --> 02:33:23,020
And he'll say lots of dirty words in succession.

1988
02:33:23,020 --> 02:33:24,020
He will.

1989
02:33:24,020 --> 02:33:25,020
But it's funny.

1990
02:33:25,020 --> 02:33:26,020
It's a good time, so tune in to that.

1991
02:33:26,020 --> 02:33:28,260
Tuesday nights on the station, our very own Dark Sakura.

1992
02:33:28,260 --> 02:33:31,140
Every other Tuesday night on the station, Dark Sakura is with us with...

1993
02:33:31,140 --> 02:33:33,380
Oh, that's the volume.

1994
02:33:33,380 --> 02:33:34,380
Sorry.

1995
02:33:34,380 --> 02:33:39,060
That's the volume which I'm doing every other Tuesday until the end of the semester, and

1996
02:33:39,060 --> 02:33:46,180
I'll be back on regularly. It's a musical request show. I play whatever. Just tune in.

1997
02:33:46,180 --> 02:33:50,420
Wednesday nights on the station, the Rob Roberts show, which is also on at 7 o'clock Pacific

1998
02:33:50,420 --> 02:33:55,980
time. And same sort of deal, I do take requests, but that's not really the concept of my show.

1999
02:33:55,980 --> 02:33:59,820
I just play whatever the hell I feel like. And I also talk about geek stuff. I'll find

2000
02:33:59,820 --> 02:34:03,460
some geek articles on the web and kind of give you my opinion on them. I'm kind of like

2001
02:34:03,460 --> 02:34:14,100
that way, except not a fat drug addict, basically. Also, on Orange Launch Radio, we may have

2002
02:34:14,100 --> 02:34:17,740
some new shows coming soon. We're looking at expanding the station in the future. It

2003
02:34:17,740 --> 02:34:22,100
may happen, may not, we don't know. Very likely, though, that you're going to see some exciting

2004
02:34:22,100 --> 02:34:26,340
stuff in the future at Orange Launch Radio. Stay tuned. Because you'll notice, you know,

2005
02:34:26,340 --> 02:34:29,740
we've got Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, we don't, you know, we've got a couple of days we could

2006
02:34:29,740 --> 02:34:34,880
to do some more other stuff with, so we will see what happens. Moving on. Shall we do some

2007
02:34:34,880 --> 02:34:38,880
Ask Orange Lounge, boys and girls? Alright, I got the thumbs up from Dark Sakura, so here

2008
02:34:38,880 --> 02:34:51,160
we go! It would help to have the volume up when I bring in the theme music, huh? Let's

2009
02:34:51,160 --> 02:34:56,880
Ask Orange Lounge, some stupid question. What will we find out this week on Orange Lounge

2010
02:34:56,880 --> 02:35:02,720
radio will we find out why this microphone is broken because I'm about to

2011
02:35:02,720 --> 02:35:09,880
throw it through a window if it doesn't cooperate yeah apparently all they heard

2012
02:35:09,880 --> 02:35:16,200
was geek articles and then fat drug addict no what I said is geek articles

2013
02:35:16,200 --> 02:35:20,360
and I'm kind of like a one-man Rush Limbaugh because I give my opinions on

2014
02:35:20,360 --> 02:35:26,200
them except I'm not a fat drug addict that was the correct thing that I said

2015
02:35:27,520 --> 02:35:33,320
Sakurina wants to know does sky like Rizlim the remix I believe I believe

2016
02:35:33,320 --> 02:35:38,920
that's a song in night style right that's over in the ninth style let me

2017
02:35:38,920 --> 02:35:42,520
see if I can get a little clip here of the Rizlim remix Dark Sakura is over

2018
02:35:42,520 --> 02:35:46,680
there in the corner gagging I take it you do not like the Rizlim remix it could

2019
02:35:46,680 --> 02:35:50,680
It could just be a lung cookie, but it sort of made my stomach turn.

2020
02:35:50,680 --> 02:35:54,680
Hold on, let me see if we can get a little clip here of the Rizlin remix.

2021
02:35:54,680 --> 02:35:59,680
Yeah, that crap.

2022
02:35:59,680 --> 02:36:03,680
I like the part that doesn't have the singing in it. Like, this is cool.

2023
02:36:03,680 --> 02:36:07,680
The bend one again in the middle.

2024
02:36:07,680 --> 02:36:10,680
I like the part where it ends.

2025
02:36:10,680 --> 02:36:14,680
I don't know, I like that kind of stuff. It just doesn't work.

2026
02:36:14,680 --> 02:36:17,880
It's okay. It's okay.

2027
02:36:17,880 --> 02:36:24,180
I prefer the original. I definitely prefer the original. But it's okay. I don't hate it. I don't despise it like I suck at this.

2028
02:36:24,180 --> 02:36:26,880
Still gotta work on the other remix.

2029
02:36:26,880 --> 02:36:33,180
Are you gonna tell us about the samples thing? Hold on, hold on. After Asgore's launch, we're gonna do it.

2030
02:36:33,180 --> 02:36:41,480
Does anyone know the approximate cost of a 2DX 9th style machine and if they are still in production?

2031
02:36:41,480 --> 02:36:43,480
At least $7,000.

2032
02:37:11,480 --> 02:37:17,480
Because he's heard me say it. And you know, Mikletov spends the weekend here sometimes, and we'll both be playing it, and he's like,

2033
02:37:17,480 --> 02:37:24,480
What's that? And we say, It's 2DX. So he knows it. Because he's seen it, he just sucks at it. Just teasing.

2034
02:37:24,480 --> 02:37:29,480
He is a pro at, uh, at Taeko no Tatsujin.

2035
02:37:29,480 --> 02:37:33,480
He is actually very good at Taeko no Tatsujin.

2036
02:37:33,480 --> 02:37:39,480
Uh, let's see, moving on. Tomo-kun wants to know, How about that show, The Boondocks?

2037
02:37:39,480 --> 02:37:41,480
I've never seen this show.

2038
02:37:41,480 --> 02:37:45,480
I remember reading the comics in my funny papers.

2039
02:37:45,480 --> 02:37:47,480
Not interested in watching this show.

2040
02:37:47,480 --> 02:37:52,480
There is a funny show I did hear about and I want to see it. It's supposed to be late tonight is when it's on.

2041
02:37:52,480 --> 02:37:59,480
MTV2. It's called Wonder Shosen. It's like an adult version of Sesame Street.

2042
02:37:59,480 --> 02:38:01,480
That sounds awesome.

2043
02:38:01,480 --> 02:38:03,480
MTV2. It's late at night.

2044
02:38:03,480 --> 02:38:05,480
Are Bert and Ernie really gay in this one?

2045
02:38:05,480 --> 02:38:10,480
No, they have, like, different characters, but they have one. It's, uh, what is it, uh...

2046
02:38:10,480 --> 02:38:13,480
D-O-G-Y-N is one of the, uh...

2047
02:38:13,480 --> 02:38:16,480
You know, like, dog O-B-G-Y-N.

2048
02:38:16,480 --> 02:38:19,480
And then, uh, they also have, um, like, some weird ones.

2049
02:38:19,480 --> 02:38:24,480
There's one, like, they were talking about the letter N, and nobody liked the letter N, so N left.

2050
02:38:24,480 --> 02:38:27,480
Then they had to find the letter S to track down the letter N.

2051
02:38:27,480 --> 02:38:33,480
And instead of tracking, uh, N down, it ended up having sex with N and had babies and stuff.

2052
02:38:33,480 --> 02:38:38,120
stuff. There's this weird shit. There's another one where they're playing Rock, Paper, Scissor

2053
02:38:38,120 --> 02:38:43,200
with God, and just really strange shit. But it sounded funny.

2054
02:38:43,200 --> 02:38:50,200
Interesting. I guess. I haven't been interested in a lot of television lately, except my crappy

2055
02:38:55,120 --> 02:39:01,660
reality shows that I watch once in a while. Ron Chan wants to know, who is your favorite

2056
02:39:01,660 --> 02:39:07,660
Who's your favorite character in the Super Mario Bros. series?

2057
02:39:07,660 --> 02:39:11,660
Who's your favorite character in the Super Mario Bros. series?

2058
02:39:11,660 --> 02:39:15,660
Ummm...

2059
02:39:15,660 --> 02:39:17,660
I don't know.

2060
02:39:17,660 --> 02:39:22,660
I'd say Princess Peach, because Peach is the winner! She's such an arrogant little fuck, I like her.

2061
02:39:22,660 --> 02:39:27,660
Big Boo! Big Boo! Big Boo is pretty awesome. You, Loki?

2062
02:39:27,660 --> 02:39:28,660
Geno.

2063
02:39:28,660 --> 02:39:29,660
Who?

2064
02:39:29,660 --> 02:39:30,660
Geno.

2065
02:39:30,660 --> 02:39:32,060
He's from Super Mario RPG.

2066
02:39:32,060 --> 02:39:33,580
Oh god.

2067
02:39:33,580 --> 02:39:36,780
Wow, that's obscure.

2068
02:39:36,780 --> 02:39:42,220
Uh, more questions.

2069
02:39:42,220 --> 02:39:47,260
Reemie asks the following, consider the following.

2070
02:39:47,260 --> 02:39:52,660
Medical science advances to the point where a device can seal wounds on the spot.

2071
02:39:52,660 --> 02:39:53,740
Problem.

2072
02:39:53,740 --> 02:39:59,940
Your friends use said technology to seal your ass shut as a practical joke.

2073
02:39:59,940 --> 02:40:00,940
What do you do?

2074
02:40:00,940 --> 02:40:05,300
Go on jackass.

2075
02:40:05,300 --> 02:40:06,300
Reveal a ban.

2076
02:40:06,300 --> 02:40:07,300
Fire it open.

2077
02:40:07,300 --> 02:40:10,540
I think you would die because your colon would explode.

2078
02:40:10,540 --> 02:40:12,180
Fire it open!

2079
02:40:12,180 --> 02:40:15,460
Or you would go to the hospital and I don't know, have them cut it open.

2080
02:40:15,460 --> 02:40:18,580
You know, yeah, I would think if the medical science is far enough along where they could

2081
02:40:18,580 --> 02:40:21,820
seal your ass shut magically they could unseal it magically.

2082
02:40:21,820 --> 02:40:27,020
If it ain't broke, I can't fix it.

2083
02:40:27,020 --> 02:40:31,580
And what are some pretty underrated songs on DDR? Oh, a real question. That's good to know.

2084
02:40:31,580 --> 02:40:35,820
What are some pretty underrated songs on DDR?

2085
02:40:35,820 --> 02:40:39,820
Moving On. Someone's knocking on the door. No, that's me. I'm tapping on the table.

2086
02:40:39,820 --> 02:40:42,820
Uh, Moving On from DDR 5th Mix.

2087
02:40:42,820 --> 02:40:46,820
I like that song. That's a cool song. What else?

2088
02:40:46,820 --> 02:40:53,820
you think of any Dark Sakura? Underrated songs in DDR. That's really easy, because I always

2089
02:40:54,140 --> 02:40:57,700
said Love That Feelin' was underrated. Oh, because a lot of people hate on Love That

2090
02:40:57,700 --> 02:41:03,940
Feelin'. Yeah. Face. Yeah, that's a good one. Yeah. God, most of the songs I like a lot

2091
02:41:03,940 --> 02:41:09,260
of- Xanadu! Xanadu. I'd say, you know what, I'd say The Seven Jump, because a lot of people

2092
02:41:09,260 --> 02:41:13,300
hate on The Seven Jump, but I love The Seven Jump. Love. Ooh, that's a good one, too. Night

2093
02:41:13,300 --> 02:41:20,300
in motion. Those are all good songs. And Conga Feelin', fuck, I love Conga Feelin'. Well,

2094
02:41:21,460 --> 02:41:25,860
it's kinda, eh, I don't know. It's fun to play. I think a lot of people know that. I

2095
02:41:25,860 --> 02:41:28,860
wouldn't say that's an underrated song, though. I think a lot of people know that one now.

2096
02:41:28,860 --> 02:41:35,860
I'm trying to think from some of the more recent mixes. Fantasy from Extreme 2. I think

2097
02:41:35,860 --> 02:41:40,260
fantasy from um... extreme 2

2098
02:41:40,260 --> 02:41:43,180
no fantasy was in max 1

2099
02:41:43,180 --> 02:41:45,940
it was in max 1 and then didn't come back from max 2

2100
02:41:45,940 --> 02:41:47,740
say that one?

2101
02:41:47,740 --> 02:41:49,340
yeah

2102
02:41:49,340 --> 02:41:54,860
is that it? That's max 2, fantasy was the one that was 0b from max 1

2103
02:41:54,860 --> 02:41:57,180
yeah that one doesn't need to go away

2104
02:41:57,180 --> 02:42:02,100
the other one that was pretty good

2105
02:42:02,100 --> 02:42:03,340
i'm trying to think of u.s.

2106
02:42:03,340 --> 02:42:06,620
Also, there's US licenses that I think are incredibly underrated.

2107
02:42:06,620 --> 02:42:08,380
I don't think...

2108
02:42:08,380 --> 02:42:12,500
The PlayStation 2 fanboys need to recognize that the Xbox has some really

2109
02:42:12,500 --> 02:42:15,340
good songs on UltraMix 2, such as Skulk.

2110
02:42:15,340 --> 02:42:18,220
But I don't know if I would call that underrated, because anyone that's played it

2111
02:42:18,220 --> 02:42:19,180
knows it's awesome.

2112
02:42:19,180 --> 02:42:22,460
But I'm trying to think of other US licenses that I think are a little bit underrated.

2113
02:42:22,460 --> 02:42:26,580
I always liked Dark Black Forest, and I know a lot of people hated on that song, but I thought it was a great

2114
02:42:26,580 --> 02:42:30,340
song. Like, just a very random choice for DDR. I thought it was great.

2115
02:42:30,340 --> 02:42:31,840
and

2116
02:42:31,840 --> 02:42:35,060
the other one there's another one that was really good those also m

2117
02:42:35,060 --> 02:42:37,380
mack's uh...

2118
02:42:37,380 --> 02:42:38,460
measures they

2119
02:42:38,460 --> 02:42:39,940
yet

2120
02:42:39,940 --> 02:42:41,660
take it to the morning

2121
02:42:41,660 --> 02:42:47,140
yeah i don't know if you're going to

2122
02:42:47,140 --> 02:42:51,020
uh... have a question for me because i see our chat room is suddenly seeing my

2123
02:42:51,020 --> 02:42:51,820
house

2124
02:42:51,820 --> 02:42:54,540
my house would you do if they put my house india are because i would be

2125
02:42:54,540 --> 02:42:57,140
successful but i don't know

2126
02:42:57,140 --> 02:43:06,640
Yeah, I would say that's pretty bad, but thank God it hasn't been put in, and I would have to show my fiancé and she'd have to laugh at me.

2127
02:43:06,640 --> 02:43:13,140
I actually like Hey Mama a lot in Ultramix 3, though. I gotta say, that was a good choice. For Black Eyed Peas, that was a really good choice.

2128
02:43:17,140 --> 02:43:20,140
Can you believe I've never heard anything by them?

2129
02:43:20,140 --> 02:43:21,140
Who, Black Eyed Peas?

2130
02:43:21,140 --> 02:43:22,140
Yep, never.

2131
02:43:23,140 --> 02:43:25,140
You don't have to fix that either.

2132
02:43:25,140 --> 02:43:26,140
Hold on, hold on.

2133
02:43:26,140 --> 02:43:28,140
You really don't have to fix that.

2134
02:43:28,140 --> 02:43:30,140
Give me one chance here.

2135
02:43:30,140 --> 02:43:33,140
I realized I went for three years without hearing a single Britney Spears song.

2136
02:43:33,140 --> 02:43:34,140
I know.

2137
02:43:34,140 --> 02:43:37,140
But now that you've heard Britney Spears, you love them, don't you?

2138
02:43:37,140 --> 02:43:38,140
No.

2139
02:43:38,140 --> 02:43:39,140
Just kidding.

2140
02:43:39,140 --> 02:43:41,140
Okay, here, try this a little bit.

2141
02:43:41,140 --> 02:43:43,140
This is a song that's in UltraMix 3.

2142
02:43:43,140 --> 02:43:46,140
And I'm not going to say you're going to like this, because you're probably not going to, but it's kind of groovy.

2143
02:43:46,140 --> 02:43:47,140
It's Hey Mama.

2144
02:43:51,140 --> 02:43:52,140
I have heard this song.

2145
02:43:52,140 --> 02:44:02,180
I heard it in spin I heard it in spin and I heard it in black

2146
02:44:02,180 --> 02:44:03,180
eyed peas?

2147
02:44:03,180 --> 02:44:05,740
Yeah Oh, in the Best Buy commercial, the, you know

2148
02:44:05,740 --> 02:44:06,740
REE-NIX!

2149
02:44:06,740 --> 02:44:12,140
Yeah, I know I friggin' hate this microphone

2150
02:44:12,140 --> 02:44:16,980
Black eyed peas are okay Zander C wants to know, do I suck at DDR if

2151
02:44:16,980 --> 02:44:21,340
I can't beat Max Unlimited on Heavy, and is it weird that I can't beat that but manage

2152
02:44:21,340 --> 02:44:25,740
to beat Charlene on In the Groove an Expert. I can't beat Max on Limited on Heavy.

2153
02:44:25,740 --> 02:44:31,580
I can. I used to play doubles, and I would play some crazy shit in doubles, and I still

2154
02:44:31,580 --> 02:44:35,580
couldn't beat it. It's just too fast. It's not really a song that should be played. They

2155
02:44:35,580 --> 02:44:39,980
just made it like really super hard, and ooh, I did it. But it's not a song that can be

2156
02:44:39,980 --> 02:44:45,220
played for fun. And I don't think it's odd that you can't beat that... Fuck, I'm gonna

2157
02:44:45,220 --> 02:44:49,660
beat this microphone up. I don't think it's odd that you can beat that, or you can't beat

2158
02:44:49,660 --> 02:44:55,300
that you can be Charlene because I remember I think it was Charlene I might

2159
02:44:55,300 --> 02:45:01,140
be mixing it up with one of the erotic songs but I think maybe I'm I might be

2160
02:45:01,140 --> 02:45:04,420
mixing up Charlene with lemmings on the run but I remember that one of them on

2161
02:45:04,420 --> 02:45:07,940
heavy had an awful lot of freezes was like the big thing was there's a lot of

2162
02:45:07,940 --> 02:45:13,340
freezes and hands and I if I could do hands unfortunately I'm very tall and my

2163
02:45:13,340 --> 02:45:16,860
back will go out very easily if I do too much of the hands thing which is one of

2164
02:45:16,860 --> 02:45:20,220
the reasons I don't like in the group because I hate the hands thing I could

2165
02:45:20,220 --> 02:45:24,300
almost beat it though if it weren't for that I don't remember if it was that or

2166
02:45:24,300 --> 02:45:27,820
Charlene that I was very close to beating but yet I haven't come close to

2167
02:45:27,820 --> 02:45:30,820
meeting Max Unlimited and I have no problem sharing that I don't think you

2168
02:45:30,820 --> 02:45:35,580
have to necessarily be the bestest DDR player in the world I mean who cares

2169
02:45:35,580 --> 02:45:39,340
you play it because it's fun that's why I play it that's why I don't mind when

2170
02:45:39,340 --> 02:45:42,680
they release a new mix of DDR and there's only one 10-footer in it and a

2171
02:45:42,680 --> 02:45:46,380
bunch of sevens I like the game better that way because DDR for me is more of a

2172
02:45:46,380 --> 02:45:53,380
a casual workout type thing and not a I want to wheeze and throw up, you know, lung chunks

2173
02:45:53,380 --> 02:45:54,380
after one song.

2174
02:45:54,380 --> 02:46:01,380
I want to get back to the wheezing part. That's fun.

2175
02:46:01,380 --> 02:46:07,020
The sad thing is I probably wouldn't even be able to beat like Breakdown or stay on

2176
02:46:07,020 --> 02:46:08,820
Heavy and I used to be able to do those no problem.

2177
02:46:08,820 --> 02:46:09,820
I would break down.

2178
02:46:09,820 --> 02:46:11,860
I probably couldn't do it.

2179
02:46:11,860 --> 02:46:22,860
I think Queen of Fiance really cuts into the 8-hour sessions of DDR that I used to do in the arcade. It's just, I can't do it anymore.

2180
02:46:22,860 --> 02:46:27,860
Oh, it's Queen of Light that's the freezes in hands, and Charlene is just a lot of runs.

2181
02:46:27,860 --> 02:46:31,860
Runs are retarded, especially if it's for no reason whatsoever.

2182
02:46:31,860 --> 02:46:33,360
What was the other one I came really close to beating?

2183
02:46:33,360 --> 02:46:34,660
A Zodiac, I think, though?

2184
02:46:34,660 --> 02:46:35,360
Doo-doo-doo-doo.

2185
02:46:35,360 --> 02:46:35,860
I like that song.

2186
02:46:35,860 --> 02:46:37,360
I actually really like that song a lot.

2187
02:46:37,360 --> 02:46:40,760
Even, you know, considering that we've said some negative things about In a Groove,

2188
02:46:40,760 --> 02:46:43,860
I do really like some of the music, and Zodiac's one of the songs I really, really like.

2189
02:46:43,860 --> 02:46:45,560
Anubis is my favorite song, though.

2190
02:46:45,560 --> 02:46:46,460
That song kicks ass.

2191
02:46:46,460 --> 02:46:48,860
I really like that song.

2192
02:46:48,860 --> 02:46:53,160
You can tell I have a thing for, uh, Banzai.

2193
02:46:53,160 --> 02:46:56,260
Uh, Legend of Zaku wants to say,

2194
02:46:56,260 --> 02:46:59,360
I'm in the market for some good-ass sake.

2195
02:46:59,360 --> 02:47:00,360
Any suggestions?

2196
02:47:00,360 --> 02:47:03,360
I've never had sake in my life, believe it or not, so I can't help you.

2197
02:47:03,360 --> 02:47:08,360
There's a brand I like, but it's a blessing to me. I can't remember how to pronounce the name, so give me a sec, I'll look for it.

2198
02:47:08,360 --> 02:47:10,360
Okay, uh, Loki?

2199
02:47:10,360 --> 02:47:11,360
I don't drink sake.

2200
02:47:11,360 --> 02:47:12,360
Yeah, I don't drink it either.

2201
02:47:12,360 --> 02:47:17,360
What's a plum wine that you usually get? I know that's not sake, but speaking of, like, you know, Asian liquor, what was that? But that was good.

2202
02:47:17,360 --> 02:47:20,360
Uh, shoot.

2203
02:47:20,360 --> 02:47:23,360
The cheap stuff I buy is the Takora brand.

2204
02:47:23,360 --> 02:47:24,360
Okay.

2205
02:47:24,360 --> 02:47:27,360
All right, check out the, uh, sake thing.

2206
02:47:27,360 --> 02:47:28,360
Sake thing.

2207
02:47:28,360 --> 02:47:33,920
Team Sakeol actually has his own energy drink, just some random trivia thrown in there.

2208
02:47:33,920 --> 02:47:37,520
Legend of Sake wants to know, I wonder if you TiVo'd last week's episodes of Direct

2209
02:47:37,520 --> 02:47:43,600
Effect in which yours truly was seen as well as New York City's best DDR player being profiled.

2210
02:47:43,600 --> 02:47:47,560
I forgot to set the TiVo, and I had it on there and everything, I forgot to do it.

2211
02:47:47,560 --> 02:47:51,480
But I know they're going to rerun it to death, it'll be on again, so I'm not too worried.

2212
02:47:51,480 --> 02:47:53,560
And I'm sure Sake will tell me when it's being rerun.

2213
02:47:53,560 --> 02:47:58,960
And here's the good brand for the ume-shuu, the plum wine, because it's got the green

2214
02:47:58,960 --> 02:47:59,960
plums at the bottom.

2215
02:47:59,960 --> 02:48:01,960
Ah, yes, I remember that.

2216
02:48:01,960 --> 02:48:06,160
Yes, you bought that once, and we got drunk off that shit.

2217
02:48:06,160 --> 02:48:08,960
And you can't tell because it doesn't taste like booze.

2218
02:48:08,960 --> 02:48:11,960
One of the first times me and you got drunk together was off that stuff.

2219
02:48:11,960 --> 02:48:12,960
Off that stuff?

2220
02:48:12,960 --> 02:48:16,960
All right, so now look up that sake and let us know.

2221
02:48:16,960 --> 02:48:18,760
Meanwhile, more questions.

2222
02:48:18,760 --> 02:48:20,560
We're doing Ask Orange Lounge here on Orange Lounge Radio.

2223
02:48:20,560 --> 02:48:23,460
If you're just joining us, this is a portion of the show where the listeners can submit

2224
02:48:23,460 --> 02:48:25,460
questions to us and we answer them because we love our listeners.

2225
02:48:25,460 --> 02:48:28,460
You should join us, you're a bit late too.

2226
02:48:28,460 --> 02:48:31,460
Seeing as, well, there's only like ten minutes of show left.

2227
02:48:31,460 --> 02:48:36,460
Um, wow, lots of questions from NintendoManiac64 and wants to know this.

2228
02:48:36,460 --> 02:48:41,460
Uh, I want to learn Japanese but I'm poor so I can't pay anything and there's nothing

2229
02:48:41,460 --> 02:48:44,460
or anyone near me that could teach it to me for free.

2230
02:48:44,460 --> 02:48:47,460
Anything good and free on the internet, I'm out of ideas.

2231
02:48:47,460 --> 02:48:50,460
I have a suggestion, try out podcasts because there's actually a lot of podcasts out there

2232
02:48:50,460 --> 02:48:54,700
try to teach you how to speak a second language, not just Spanish, but I'm sure there's a Japanese

2233
02:48:54,700 --> 02:48:58,980
one out there, too. A lot of good, free stuff. I don't know if you can find anything at an

2234
02:48:58,980 --> 02:49:04,460
elementary level, but you never know. Also, sometimes if you look on some of the sites

2235
02:49:04,460 --> 02:49:10,300
such as BitTorrent stuff, you can sometimes find and learn how to speak Japanese CD, which,

2236
02:49:10,300 --> 02:49:15,900
you know, isn't, it's better than nothing. Go to college. Or, yeah, or go to college.

2237
02:49:15,900 --> 02:49:25,400
Or if you have a Usenet access and were signed up on MBZworld.com or something like that.

2238
02:49:25,400 --> 02:49:32,100
Anyways, they're CDs. But you can find them just any BitTorrent site. You should be able to find anything.

2239
02:49:32,100 --> 02:49:41,200
I mean, really. Except for whatever reason, the BooBoom Satellites, their CDs are not on the internet.

2240
02:49:41,200 --> 02:49:43,300
Not the one I'm looking for, at least.

2241
02:49:43,300 --> 02:49:47,940
NintendoManiac64 says, did anyone make a YTMND out of your I like big dick quote yet?

2242
02:49:47,940 --> 02:49:50,300
Um, no they haven't, and I hope they don't.

2243
02:49:50,300 --> 02:49:55,560
Uh, also wants to know, how was my Firefox Mario Kart DS decal?

2244
02:49:55,560 --> 02:50:00,420
Um, it was cool, it was, I imagine you probably used that same thing that a lot of

2245
02:50:00,420 --> 02:50:03,940
people use to, to turn a graphic into a, um, emblem.

2246
02:50:03,940 --> 02:50:06,220
But what I want to know is, what was that thing

2247
02:50:06,220 --> 02:50:08,900
where you were going back and forth, because I remember playing you,

2248
02:50:08,900 --> 02:50:12,860
you were going back and forth on the track a lot. Like, I don't know if you were

2249
02:50:12,860 --> 02:50:16,820
trying to do like a bunch of drifts, but you were going really fast, and I know you weren't

2250
02:50:16,820 --> 02:50:21,260
getting that many mushrooms, so I don't know, were you trying to do a bunch of drifts or

2251
02:50:21,260 --> 02:50:22,260
something?

2252
02:50:22,260 --> 02:50:23,260
Snaking.

2253
02:50:23,260 --> 02:50:24,260
Snaking.

2254
02:50:24,260 --> 02:50:25,260
What the hell is this?

2255
02:50:25,260 --> 02:50:26,260
Well, um...

2256
02:50:26,260 --> 02:50:27,260
I didn't know this was taking place.

2257
02:50:27,260 --> 02:50:29,660
You know, things I've seen, though, people doing wasn't snaking, because it was just

2258
02:50:29,660 --> 02:50:32,180
like they're, it looks like they're spasming on the track.

2259
02:50:32,180 --> 02:50:36,320
I understand what snaking is, where you do the mini, um, you drift back and forth really

2260
02:50:36,320 --> 02:50:39,860
quick to do the little boost, so you go faster that way.

2261
02:50:39,860 --> 02:50:43,740
It's hard to do, you have to have the right kart for it, but you can do it.

2262
02:50:43,740 --> 02:50:50,100
But the thing is though, they used to do that actually in, remember back in F-Zero GX, except

2263
02:50:50,100 --> 02:50:55,620
that was done differently, that was with the break boosting or whatever, and you can do

2264
02:50:55,620 --> 02:51:00,020
that with Mario Kart Double Dash, you can do it with the drift, same way.

2265
02:51:00,020 --> 02:51:04,860
But this is something different though, and I don't know why, because when I've seen these

2266
02:51:04,860 --> 02:51:08,660
players, they've been bouncing around literally all over the track.

2267
02:51:08,660 --> 02:51:13,340
So I don't know what that is.

2268
02:51:13,340 --> 02:51:15,540
Is anyone there really gay?

2269
02:51:15,540 --> 02:51:21,420
I'm ignorant and gullible, so I usually can't tell if you guys are joking or not.

2270
02:51:21,420 --> 02:51:27,060
Dark Sakura has a husband, so obviously she is, you know, Dansexual I believe as she calls

2271
02:51:27,060 --> 02:51:28,060
it.

2272
02:51:28,060 --> 02:51:29,060
Dansexual!

2273
02:51:29,060 --> 02:51:34,100
Loki has a fiancé and does not like any of the cock as far as I know.

2274
02:51:34,100 --> 02:51:36,220
Not that he has a problem with that.

2275
02:51:36,220 --> 02:51:38,220
He's completely straight, yes?

2276
02:51:38,220 --> 02:51:45,980
Yes, I am gay. I am literally gay, and it's fine. It's not a joke. We joke about it because

2277
02:51:45,980 --> 02:51:51,620
it's kind of like how gay people can call each other fag and that's okay. Just like

2278
02:51:51,620 --> 02:51:59,420
how black people always call... Never mind. Forget it. But, yes, I'm gay and so is Exeter,

2279
02:51:59,420 --> 02:52:02,340
but we are not together. That's a very common misconception I think people think because

2280
02:52:02,340 --> 02:52:06,140
Exeter and I live together and we're both gay. We must be fucking, but that's not true.

2281
02:52:06,140 --> 02:52:10,140
No, Xfer and I are just buds, we're like brothers, nothing like that.

2282
02:52:10,140 --> 02:52:15,340
However, I date, I've been seeing someone, and I've kind of brought that up a couple

2283
02:52:15,340 --> 02:52:19,840
times on the show, but I don't think he'd be used to the idea of me talking about him

2284
02:52:19,840 --> 02:52:23,180
on the air yet, and he could be listening, so I don't say a whole lot about it.

2285
02:52:23,180 --> 02:52:24,180
But he's cool.

2286
02:52:24,180 --> 02:52:25,180
He's a gamer, too.

2287
02:52:25,180 --> 02:52:27,740
He plays Mario Kart DS with me, so he rocks.

2288
02:52:27,740 --> 02:52:31,420
And who else?

2289
02:52:31,420 --> 02:52:33,340
I think he's cute, too.

2290
02:52:33,340 --> 02:52:34,340
Oh, thank you.

2291
02:52:34,340 --> 02:52:38,340
Thank you. He is cute. He is a cutie. A little quiet sometimes, but a cutie, I like.

2292
02:52:38,340 --> 02:52:40,840
Even though the one time I met him I was highly intoxicated.

2293
02:52:40,840 --> 02:52:42,840
You were very intoxicated, but he's a nice guy.

2294
02:52:44,840 --> 02:52:47,840
And I don't think Miklotov would mind me sharing that he's gay too.

2295
02:52:47,840 --> 02:52:49,840
And that's cool.

2296
02:52:49,840 --> 02:52:52,340
So yes, there are really gay people that do this.

2297
02:52:52,340 --> 02:52:55,840
But we don't talk a whole lot about, well we do talk about the sexuality thing,

2298
02:52:55,840 --> 02:52:57,840
and I think it might be hard to tell that we're joking sometimes,

2299
02:52:57,840 --> 02:53:02,840
but like on the podcast, I don't think I've ever really brought this up,

2300
02:53:02,840 --> 02:53:06,120
up, although I need to at some point, and I'm sure we'll get into a discussion at some

2301
02:53:06,120 --> 02:53:12,400
point about minority gamers. It doesn't come up because, you know, we're about games, and

2302
02:53:12,400 --> 02:53:16,600
sexuality usually doesn't play into video games, unless we're going to talk about booth

2303
02:53:16,600 --> 02:53:20,520
babes at E3. We're going to talk about, there is sexism on the internet, and I know that

2304
02:53:20,520 --> 02:53:26,440
Dark Soccer has seen this shit firsthand, because not just her, but other girl presenters

2305
02:53:26,440 --> 02:53:31,280
on podcasts, game podcasts, get targeted. They do. Because some guys don't know how

2306
02:53:31,280 --> 02:53:33,720
how to deal with that. I don't know what it is. They assume that she's a giggling girl.

2307
02:53:33,720 --> 02:53:39,720
To quote one site, put down the controller and get back in the kitchen. Excuse me, fuck

2308
02:53:39,720 --> 02:53:49,720
you. That's just stupid. Okay, he's got too many questions, so I'm jumping right to his

2309
02:53:49,720 --> 02:53:54,920
last question. Why did you say I used the decal generator? I made my Firefox decal myself.

2310
02:53:54,920 --> 02:54:04,500
two hours good for you sorry I made an assumption shoot me rare I'm going to

2311
02:54:04,500 --> 02:54:14,660
make a penis decal I have to play the game just to do that I like in our chat

2312
02:54:14,660 --> 02:54:18,340
room there I'm just now reading all the chat room is that everybody is like

2313
02:54:18,340 --> 02:54:22,420
gasping and and saying that they're so surprised at the fact that I'm gay and

2314
02:54:22,420 --> 02:54:29,180
and Zaku says that Sky can't say nigga oh crap oh crap I just saw man I screwed

2315
02:54:29,180 --> 02:54:36,140
up and then of course my favorite term ever gamer color of Sakura says I'm a

2316
02:54:36,140 --> 02:54:46,900
gamer with a G a y-cat like get it gamer love it moving on color of Sakura wants

2317
02:54:46,900 --> 02:54:51,780
to know any suggestions on what 2dx song track I should buy I have 2dx red and

2318
02:54:51,780 --> 02:54:55,420
Happy Sky, so other than those two.

2319
02:54:55,420 --> 02:54:58,580
I love, love, love Fifth Style.

2320
02:54:58,580 --> 02:55:00,700
Go figure, I love Fifth Style's soundtrack.

2321
02:55:00,700 --> 02:55:01,620
So I suggest that.

2322
02:55:01,620 --> 02:55:03,540
If you're going to go old school, go for Fifth Style.

2323
02:55:03,540 --> 02:55:05,740
I used to wake up to that every morning.

2324
02:55:05,740 --> 02:55:07,060
Eight.

2325
02:55:07,060 --> 02:55:09,580
There you have it.

2326
02:55:09,580 --> 02:55:12,500
Neodude Zero says, what good dance pads are there,

2327
02:55:12,500 --> 02:55:16,740
besides Red Octane, that don't cost $500?

2328
02:55:16,740 --> 02:55:18,980
There's the kind you build yourself.

2329
02:55:18,980 --> 02:55:20,980
There's the one that DDR Game puts out,

2330
02:55:20,980 --> 02:55:24,740
but I'm going to be honest, we played it at E3, not impressed by their product.

2331
02:55:24,740 --> 02:55:26,420
Emmett injured.

2332
02:55:26,420 --> 02:55:28,660
That's right, that's right, I remember that.

2333
02:55:28,660 --> 02:55:31,020
Yeah, so honestly, um...

2334
02:55:31,020 --> 02:55:35,780
I suppose if you want something that is cheap and effective and you don't play a lot of cattas,

2335
02:55:35,780 --> 02:55:37,660
just go for the $20 Mad Catz ones.

2336
02:55:37,660 --> 02:55:42,220
I know a lot of people knock on the Mad Catz ones, but honestly, for the casual DDR player,

2337
02:55:42,220 --> 02:55:43,220
it'll work. It'll get you through the day.

2338
02:55:43,220 --> 02:55:46,380
Or if you take a soft pad and, you know, mount it on wood,

2339
02:55:46,380 --> 02:55:49,100
and, you know, do the, uh...

2340
02:55:49,100 --> 02:55:53,100
you know that's a good idea too yeah just basically mounting something on a

2341
02:55:53,100 --> 02:55:53,820
board

2342
02:55:53,820 --> 02:55:57,460
makes a soft pad even better a guana girl used to have that she came up again here

2343
02:55:57,460 --> 02:56:00,620
but as she used to have that at all the apartment they worked very very well

2344
02:56:00,620 --> 02:56:05,620
that was the first 9 footer i ever passed was on those me too i think no second 9 footer i ever did was on those

2345
02:56:05,620 --> 02:56:09,460
because i passed um electro tuned that's right

2346
02:56:09,460 --> 02:56:13,460
and then i but i no it wasn't electro tuned it was

2347
02:56:13,460 --> 02:56:16,980
it was something it was looping it was not a crisis it was looping looping

2348
02:56:46,980 --> 02:56:49,900
um... test location came out. I remember that.

2349
02:56:49,900 --> 02:56:54,380
That was so stupid. But good. It was good. And it was so easy.

2350
02:56:54,380 --> 02:56:56,660
I miss bimani parties. We need to have another one.

2351
02:56:56,660 --> 02:57:01,020
We do. I have a house now. Let's just get drunk and call it a bimani party.

2352
02:57:01,020 --> 02:57:04,900
I think once I get my house in order, I'm planning on having one. Badass. If Dan doesn't like it.

2353
02:57:04,900 --> 02:57:06,860
We should broadcast live from it.

2354
02:57:06,860 --> 02:57:10,940
That would rock. Legend of Zaku says, how come game chain stores and some small time

2355
02:57:10,940 --> 02:57:14,380
mom and pop stores treat new sealed games like beater copies

2356
02:57:14,380 --> 02:57:18,860
when trying to get money for them. Because they assume you stole them.

2357
02:57:18,860 --> 02:57:22,220
Honestly, I think that's why a lot of people have policies against sealed

2358
02:57:22,220 --> 02:57:23,020
games is because

2359
02:57:23,020 --> 02:57:26,580
it's assumed that they're stolen, and I know what you're doing. I know you didn't steal them.

2360
02:57:26,580 --> 02:57:28,540
I know you're trying to sell back promo copies,

2361
02:57:28,540 --> 02:57:31,900
but you're not supposed to sell back promo copies either. It's actually...

2362
02:57:31,900 --> 02:57:35,980
I don't know so much about giveaways. Giveaways is kind of a gray area,

2363
02:57:35,980 --> 02:57:39,940
but at least promo copies, usually when they do giveaways, they give away promo copies,

2364
02:57:39,940 --> 02:57:43,100
and as part of the deal with promo copies, you're not supposed to sell them.

2365
02:57:43,100 --> 02:57:47,160
That's why the, like with motion pictures and stuff, big deal, like they put the tracking

2366
02:57:47,160 --> 02:57:50,120
numbers on the screeners and all that shit, you know, eh.

2367
02:57:50,120 --> 02:57:51,120
Crazy stuff.

2368
02:57:51,120 --> 02:57:56,000
Almost done with the show, let's get to one last question here.

2369
02:57:56,000 --> 02:58:02,860
Rayne wants to know, what can I use to convert WMV3 encoded media to anything that isn't

2370
02:58:02,860 --> 02:58:07,340
WMV3, AVI, MPEG, DivX, etc. on a PC?

2371
02:58:07,340 --> 02:58:08,340
I have no idea.

2372
02:58:08,340 --> 02:58:10,340
I don't know enough about video encoding, I'm going to be honest.

2373
02:58:10,340 --> 02:58:12,340
You have to Google and look it up!

2374
02:58:40,340 --> 02:58:42,340
I'm hoping someone in our chat knows.

2375
02:58:42,340 --> 02:58:46,340
We just had a link posted to JetAudio.com.

2376
02:58:46,340 --> 02:58:48,340
There we go. There you have it.

2377
02:58:48,340 --> 02:58:51,340
Well, kids, it's about 9.30. It's about time for us to wrap up the show.

2380
02:58:55,340 --> 02:58:57,340
But it was a very popular segment.

2381
02:58:57,340 --> 02:58:59,340
