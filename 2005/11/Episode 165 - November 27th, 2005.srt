1
00:00:00,109 --> 00:00:07,210
[SPEAKER_11]: Monkey, Monkey, Monkey, Monkey, Monkey, Monkey, Monkey, Monkey, I'm gonna be a monkey.

2
00:00:07,270 --> 00:00:11,831
[SPEAKER_11]: Monkey, Monkey, Monkey, would you like to be one too?

3
00:00:12,451 --> 00:00:18,092
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, if you wanna be a monkey, you gotta learn to act like a monkey.

4
00:00:18,212 --> 00:00:22,873
[SPEAKER_11]: And I've got the know-how, cause I've seen every car and movie ever made.

5
00:00:22,933 --> 00:00:24,293
[SPEAKER_11]: So watch and learn.

6
00:00:28,314 --> 00:00:30,079
[SPEAKER_15]: Hey, everybody.

7
00:00:30,580 --> 00:00:35,171
[SPEAKER_15]: I just made up a song, and I hope you can sing along with me.

8
00:00:36,198 --> 00:00:37,799
[SPEAKER_15]: It's called I'm a Cucumber.

9
00:00:38,019 --> 00:00:38,440
[SPEAKER_15]: Here we go.

10
00:00:39,020 --> 00:00:40,581
[SPEAKER_15]: One, two, three, four.

11
00:00:41,502 --> 00:00:42,482
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm a cucumber.

12
00:00:43,543 --> 00:00:44,524
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm a cucumber.

13
00:00:45,605 --> 00:00:46,605
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm a cucumber.

14
00:00:47,626 --> 00:00:48,587
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm a cucumber.

15
00:00:49,647 --> 00:00:50,628
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm a cucumber.

16
00:00:51,629 --> 00:00:52,609
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm a cucumber.

17
00:00:52,950 --> 00:00:56,772
[SPEAKER_15]: Please don't take me to Pickle Farm.

18
00:00:57,273 --> 00:01:00,195
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you very much, everybody.

19
00:01:00,235 --> 00:01:00,575
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

23
00:01:38,271 --> 00:01:46,313
[SPEAKER_22]: We're going to talk a lot tonight about catching up with Jamie, because it's been a little while, because she's been bogged down by viruses.

24
00:01:47,737 --> 00:01:55,343
[SPEAKER_22]: and hopefully she's not contagious because we don't all want to catch bubonic plague.

25
00:01:55,563 --> 00:01:56,964
[SPEAKER_22]: But we might all catch ferret.

26
00:01:57,444 --> 00:01:58,725
[SPEAKER_22]: We shall see on tonight's episode.

27
00:01:58,825 --> 00:02:10,414
[SPEAKER_22]: Also tonight, your calls and such and more information on DER Strike and Miklatov's in the house for a little bit to talk about his love for something that isn't a video game.

28
00:02:11,855 --> 00:02:12,375
[SPEAKER_22]: I know that.

29
00:02:13,256 --> 00:02:14,977
[SPEAKER_22]: And God knows what else.

[SPEAKER_19]: Orange Lounge may contain a scene of nudity.

00:03:34,442 --> 00:03:44,689
[SPEAKER_19]: Orange Lounge may contain plenty of... Just kidding, Orange Lounge Radio will not contain any of that in this episode.

37
00:03:44,769 --> 00:03:46,631
[SPEAKER_20]: Well, isn't that special?

[SPEAKER_22]: Joining me, as always, are my awesome co-hosts in this corner.

44
00:04:43,635 --> 00:04:46,776
[SPEAKER_22]: Welcome back, the happiest bunny on the farm, Dark Sakura.

45
00:04:47,036 --> 00:04:47,256
[SPEAKER_21]: Hi.

46
00:04:47,536 --> 00:04:47,876
[SPEAKER_22]: How are you?

47
00:04:49,085 --> 00:04:50,965
[SPEAKER_21]: Um, I don't know.

48
00:04:51,746 --> 00:04:58,567
[SPEAKER_22]: You don't, you say you're still kind of, you're obviously, you're coughing right now, that's not picking up on the mic, but you don't sound sick.

49
00:04:58,687 --> 00:05:05,508
[SPEAKER_22]: Like the last two weeks you sounded sick, but now it's kind of one of those, you obviously have a virus or something because you don't sound sick.

50
00:05:05,908 --> 00:05:10,029
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't have a virus, it's bacterial and my voice does on occasion come and go.

51
00:05:10,209 --> 00:05:10,449
[SPEAKER_22]: Okay.

52
00:05:10,469 --> 00:05:12,750
[SPEAKER_08]: That's why I didn't really talk much today.

53
00:05:12,770 --> 00:05:14,590
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, but you sound pretty solid tonight, so.

54
00:05:14,930 --> 00:05:15,130
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah.

55
00:05:15,598 --> 00:05:17,139
[SPEAKER_08]: I apparently have whooping cough now.

56
00:05:18,339 --> 00:05:21,960
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, we're going to play the Wheel of Infection, I think it's what Loki called it.

57
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:24,141
[SPEAKER_22]: Wheel of Infection, turn, turn, turn.

58
00:05:24,181 --> 00:05:26,181
[SPEAKER_22]: Show us which disease Jamie should have.

59
00:05:26,361 --> 00:05:36,085
[SPEAKER_08]: Thing is, is that whooping cough is something you're inoculated against when you're younger, only it apparently has something like some 10, 20% chance of hitting you when you're older.

60
00:05:37,045 --> 00:05:37,525
[SPEAKER_08]: Fun, huh?

61
00:05:38,065 --> 00:05:38,445
[SPEAKER_22]: Exciting.

62
00:05:38,965 --> 00:05:39,586
[SPEAKER_08]: Yay, diseases.

63
00:05:40,807 --> 00:05:42,654
[SPEAKER_22]: So we'll be talking diseases with Jamie tonight.

64
00:05:42,775 --> 00:05:45,345
[SPEAKER_22]: Also, in that corner, we'll be talking hamburgers with Loki!

65
00:05:46,311 --> 00:05:47,032
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm almost done.

66
00:05:47,932 --> 00:05:49,934
[SPEAKER_22]: How is your biggest gainer adventure going?

67
00:05:51,075 --> 00:05:51,475
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going.

68
00:05:51,956 --> 00:05:54,018
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't had McDonald's, though, in a week, at least.

69
00:05:54,138 --> 00:05:56,640
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that's an accomplishment, I suppose.

70
00:05:56,680 --> 00:06:00,943
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I had turkey this week, so no time for McDonald's.

71
00:06:01,043 --> 00:06:08,650
[SPEAKER_02]: But no, I actually just kind of wanted something quick, didn't have anything, so I got two cheeseburgers, which is a lot better than having a double quarter pounder, I mean, obviously.

72
00:06:09,010 --> 00:06:09,531
[SPEAKER_22]: I guess.

73
00:06:09,871 --> 00:06:14,695
[SPEAKER_22]: But you know what would be really good would be like one of those fruit and walnut salads would be a really good choice.

74
00:06:14,915 --> 00:06:15,876
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, there's a problem here.

75
00:06:16,156 --> 00:06:16,976
[SPEAKER_02]: That's actually worse.

76
00:06:17,536 --> 00:06:17,917
[SPEAKER_22]: Really?

77
00:06:18,157 --> 00:06:19,077
[SPEAKER_22]: I don't eat salad.

78
00:06:19,698 --> 00:06:20,978
[SPEAKER_22]: If you use half the walnuts.

79
00:06:21,038 --> 00:06:21,839
[SPEAKER_22]: They're heavy sugar.

80
00:06:21,859 --> 00:06:23,720
[SPEAKER_22]: I mean, it's candied walnuts.

81
00:06:23,740 --> 00:06:26,501
[SPEAKER_22]: I only use half the walnuts because I know that they're candied walnuts.

82
00:06:26,661 --> 00:06:30,123
[SPEAKER_08]: And dried fruit is even higher in sugar than... Yes, it is.

83
00:06:30,984 --> 00:06:32,164
[SPEAKER_22]: It concentrates the sugar.

84
00:06:32,184 --> 00:06:34,325
[SPEAKER_22]: I hate the regular... I don't like their regular salads.

85
00:06:34,346 --> 00:06:37,347
[SPEAKER_22]: If I'm going to get a regular salad, I want like Fresh Choice, Laboo, a real salad place.

86
00:06:37,387 --> 00:06:38,468
[SPEAKER_22]: I can't do McDonald's salads.

87
00:06:39,048 --> 00:06:39,429
[SPEAKER_22]: But anyway.

88
00:06:39,930 --> 00:06:42,634
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm eating one of their salads right now and I find it highly tasty.

89
00:06:42,835 --> 00:06:44,177
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't, bleh, I can't do it.

90
00:06:44,317 --> 00:06:44,938
[SPEAKER_02]: I hate salads.

91
00:06:45,139 --> 00:06:46,140
[SPEAKER_02]: I hate the taste of lettuce.

92
00:06:46,461 --> 00:06:47,623
[SPEAKER_02]: I've tried it numerous times.

93
00:06:47,904 --> 00:06:48,865
[SPEAKER_02]: I do not like lettuce.

94
00:06:50,368 --> 00:06:50,889
[SPEAKER_02]: It's awful.

95
00:06:51,195 --> 00:06:53,356
[SPEAKER_22]: Lettuce is something I used to hate as a child, but I like it now.

96
00:06:53,496 --> 00:06:56,097
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't care for lettuce, I prefer spinach, and this has spinach in it.

97
00:06:56,297 --> 00:06:56,778
[SPEAKER_08]: Spinach is good.

98
00:06:56,858 --> 00:07:02,100
[SPEAKER_22]: Anyway, we'll talk plenty of food later throughout the show, but also say hello to the one and only Mikotov.

99
00:07:02,540 --> 00:07:02,941
[SPEAKER_10]: Hello.

100
00:07:03,221 --> 00:07:04,941
[SPEAKER_22]: Are you playing Mario Kart Online right now?

101
00:07:05,102 --> 00:07:06,422
[SPEAKER_10]: No, I'm trying to unlock Rob.

102
00:07:07,343 --> 00:07:08,003
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, I'm right here.

103
00:07:10,844 --> 00:07:11,384
[SPEAKER_22]: God, I'm funny.

104
00:07:11,565 --> 00:07:12,725
[SPEAKER_02]: He's working on the chassis he built.

105
00:07:13,105 --> 00:07:13,385
[SPEAKER_22]: I see.

106
00:07:14,926 --> 00:07:15,246
What?

107
00:07:16,427 --> 00:07:17,667
[SPEAKER_22]: I somehow highly doubt that.

108
00:07:18,588 --> 00:07:18,808
[SPEAKER_22]: Anyway.

109
00:07:19,653 --> 00:07:20,834
[SPEAKER_22]: How far are you in Unlocking Rob?

110
00:07:20,874 --> 00:07:21,375
[SPEAKER_22]: You almost there?

111
00:07:22,976 --> 00:07:26,039
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, I have like two more races, and then, yeah, I finished.

112
00:07:26,299 --> 00:07:31,644
[SPEAKER_22]: Alright, well stop interrupting him then, because he's very zen-like in playing his Mario Kart over there, so we'll leave him alone.

113
00:07:31,664 --> 00:07:36,949
[SPEAKER_02]: I've taken a break from Mario Kart today to actually be doing the show, and there's a puzzle with this mic.

114
00:07:37,289 --> 00:07:37,709
[SPEAKER_22]: I can't speak.

115
00:07:38,230 --> 00:07:39,011
[SPEAKER_22]: I refuse to play.

116
00:07:40,172 --> 00:07:41,813
[SPEAKER_22]: I want more information on this when we come back.

117
00:07:41,833 --> 00:07:42,933
[SPEAKER_22]: We're going to take a quick break, though.

118
00:07:43,874 --> 00:07:46,796
[SPEAKER_22]: And I got to play Tent Style this week, so I'm in a very Tent Style-ish mood.

119
00:07:47,597 --> 00:07:49,158
[SPEAKER_22]: So we're going to play some music from Tent Style.

120
00:07:49,498 --> 00:07:51,159
[SPEAKER_22]: And then we'll come back and do our show.

121
00:07:51,540 --> 00:07:53,841
[SPEAKER_22]: So join our chatroom, www.orangelandreo.com.

122
00:07:54,141 --> 00:07:54,802
[SPEAKER_22]: We'll be right back.

123
00:07:54,922 --> 00:08:00,446
[SPEAKER_22]: After this, we're going to start it off with a song called Strong Woman.

124
00:08:01,246 --> 00:08:02,267
[SPEAKER_22]: One of the CS songs.

125
00:08:02,667 --> 00:08:03,448
[SPEAKER_22]: Hopefully it works.

126
00:08:03,468 --> 00:08:03,708
[SPEAKER_22]: I don't know.

127
00:08:03,748 --> 00:08:05,830
[SPEAKER_22]: I just got this before the show started, so I hope it works.

128
00:08:06,170 --> 00:08:07,531
[SPEAKER_22]: We'll be back after this with more Orange Lingerie.

129
00:09:57,997 --> 00:10:01,008
[SPEAKER_03]: I just ain't got no way to go

130
00:13:54,549 --> 00:13:55,436
Thanks for watching!

131
00:15:49,505 --> 00:15:54,288
[SPEAKER_07]: From StepSquad to OrangeLoud, this PDR sucks!

132
00:15:54,628 --> 00:15:57,550
[SPEAKER_07]: Holla, holla, holla, holla, holla, holla, holla!

133
00:16:03,206 --> 00:16:05,128
[SPEAKER_22]: Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio.

134
00:16:05,148 --> 00:16:08,490
[SPEAKER_22]: We're in the middle of episode number 165, if you can believe it.

135
00:16:08,851 --> 00:16:12,934
[SPEAKER_22]: I was just kind of thinking about today, you know, 165 doesn't sound like a big number.

136
00:16:13,515 --> 00:16:15,416
[SPEAKER_22]: Would you consider that that's one a week?

137
00:16:16,317 --> 00:16:17,358
[SPEAKER_22]: That is an awfully long time.

138
00:16:17,638 --> 00:16:18,399
[SPEAKER_22]: 165 weeks.

139
00:16:18,719 --> 00:16:22,002
[SPEAKER_22]: That doesn't even count weeks off and stuff, because we're entitled to a week off once in a while, damn it.

140
00:16:22,542 --> 00:16:22,942
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes, Loki?

141
00:16:23,503 --> 00:16:23,743
[SPEAKER_22]: Thought.

142
00:16:23,823 --> 00:16:25,004
[SPEAKER_22]: You have your finger up in thought.

143
00:16:26,325 --> 00:16:28,867
[SPEAKER_22]: Your mic's not on, but... Why'd you turn the mic off?

144
00:16:29,268 --> 00:16:29,748
[SPEAKER_22]: Bad you.

145
00:16:30,288 --> 00:16:31,009
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, um...

146
00:16:31,539 --> 00:16:33,707
[SPEAKER_02]: Is 169 going to be on New Year's Eve?

147
00:16:35,225 --> 00:16:35,965
[SPEAKER_22]: I don't know.

148
00:16:36,125 --> 00:16:39,166
[SPEAKER_22]: We have to decide, and we can worry about this next month if we're going to do shows.

149
00:16:39,186 --> 00:16:41,867
[SPEAKER_22]: Because I think, isn't Christmas and New Year's Eve on a Sunday this year?

150
00:16:42,107 --> 00:16:42,647
[SPEAKER_08]: Both are.

151
00:16:43,107 --> 00:16:44,548
[SPEAKER_22]: See, I don't know if we want to do shows then.

152
00:16:46,348 --> 00:16:48,849
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know about you, but I'm not going to be here on Christmas.

153
00:16:48,889 --> 00:16:51,990
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, New Year's Eve, definitely not, because there's other things I've got to do.

154
00:16:52,090 --> 00:16:54,051
[SPEAKER_22]: So we might be taking some time off for the holidays.

155
00:16:54,271 --> 00:16:54,851
[SPEAKER_22]: And you know what?

156
00:16:55,691 --> 00:16:56,131
[SPEAKER_22]: We earned it.

157
00:16:56,291 --> 00:16:57,091
[SPEAKER_22]: So shut up.

158
00:16:57,111 --> 00:16:58,932
[SPEAKER_02]: Someone's going to be listening anyway.

159
00:16:58,972 --> 00:17:01,213
[SPEAKER_22]: We'll do a marathon or something special.

160
00:17:01,253 --> 00:17:02,133
[SPEAKER_22]: We're pre-recorded.

161
00:17:02,433 --> 00:17:05,495
[SPEAKER_22]: A little special treat for... Yeah, nobody's going to want to listen to us on New Year's Eve.

162
00:17:05,555 --> 00:17:05,815
[SPEAKER_22]: Come on.

163
00:17:06,676 --> 00:17:09,037
[SPEAKER_22]: People are going to go out to parties and stuff.

164
00:17:09,317 --> 00:17:13,079
[SPEAKER_22]: Maybe the dude that records us every week will record the station to see what was here.

165
00:17:13,340 --> 00:17:14,920
[SPEAKER_22]: Actually, there's several people that are recording us.

166
00:17:15,281 --> 00:17:19,423
[SPEAKER_22]: But I don't see a big demand for programming on New Year's Eve.

167
00:17:19,523 --> 00:17:21,724
[SPEAKER_22]: Now I've got to talk to...

168
00:17:22,987 --> 00:17:24,548
[SPEAKER_22]: DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

169
00:17:52,136 --> 00:17:53,817
[SPEAKER_22]: Okay, granted, but you know.

170
00:17:53,837 --> 00:17:54,037
[SPEAKER_22]: And me.

171
00:17:55,118 --> 00:17:55,538
[SPEAKER_22]: Oh, whatever.

172
00:17:55,678 --> 00:17:56,018
[SPEAKER_22]: I don't care.

173
00:17:56,038 --> 00:18:00,501
[SPEAKER_02]: I can get near alcohol poisoning, but I don't get hangovers.

174
00:18:00,541 --> 00:18:00,921
[SPEAKER_22]: Go, Greg.

175
00:18:01,261 --> 00:18:02,862
[SPEAKER_22]: Okay.

176
00:18:02,922 --> 00:18:04,063
[SPEAKER_22]: Lots of good points in the chat.

177
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:05,063
[SPEAKER_22]: I've seen how the chat was lighting up.

178
00:18:05,543 --> 00:18:06,604
[SPEAKER_22]: What about Jewish people?

179
00:18:06,904 --> 00:18:07,965
[SPEAKER_22]: They want a show on Christmas.

180
00:18:10,239 --> 00:18:12,480
[SPEAKER_08]: We can do the Hanukkah special.

181
00:18:12,540 --> 00:18:14,201
[SPEAKER_22]: Hanukkah starts today after Christmas.

182
00:18:14,241 --> 00:18:18,302
[SPEAKER_22]: I want to do like a Kwanzaa special, Orange Lounge Radio Kwanzaa special.

183
00:18:18,442 --> 00:18:20,763
[SPEAKER_08]: Why don't we do the generic holiday special?

184
00:18:21,043 --> 00:18:21,624
[SPEAKER_22]: Maybe, we'll see.

185
00:18:21,804 --> 00:18:23,104
[SPEAKER_08]: The pick your holiday special.

186
00:18:23,184 --> 00:18:27,346
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll do Orange Lounge celebrates Hallmark's Christmas.

187
00:18:27,788 --> 00:18:30,569
[SPEAKER_22]: That'll be a Hallmark Presents, the Orange Lawn Trio.

188
00:18:30,589 --> 00:18:36,192
[SPEAKER_22]: We'll get Extifer in here to share some stories with the Hallmark Trademark.

189
00:18:37,653 --> 00:18:39,474
[SPEAKER_22]: Let's see what else they're saying in the chatroom there.

190
00:18:39,774 --> 00:18:42,055
[SPEAKER_22]: Oh, everybody's booing us for not wanting to do a Christmas episode.

191
00:18:43,176 --> 00:18:43,536
[SPEAKER_22]: Bitches.

192
00:18:45,277 --> 00:18:47,818
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, excuse me, maybe we'd like to spend time with our family.

193
00:18:47,838 --> 00:18:49,039
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, we want to open up presents.

194
00:18:49,239 --> 00:18:50,840
[SPEAKER_22]: That's a very important part of Christmas.

195
00:18:50,860 --> 00:18:51,380
[SPEAKER_22]: Not Christmas Day.

196
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:53,681
[SPEAKER_08]: I want Christmas nookie, dammit, and I'm not going to be here.

197
00:18:53,761 --> 00:18:54,401
[SPEAKER_22]: Exactly.

198
00:18:54,501 --> 00:18:55,542
[SPEAKER_22]: I want Christmas nookie, too.

199
00:18:57,921 --> 00:18:58,822
[SPEAKER_22]: Anyway, how was Thanksgiving?

200
00:18:58,842 --> 00:18:59,942
[SPEAKER_22]: Did you get any Thanksgiving, Nookie?

201
00:19:01,263 --> 00:19:02,804
[SPEAKER_08]: No, I'm still too sick.

202
00:19:04,406 --> 00:19:14,552
[SPEAKER_08]: I ate my food, and then I got such a bad headache trying to watch Dan play Perfect Dark Zero, which was a very pretty, very pretty game.

203
00:19:15,828 --> 00:19:22,532
[SPEAKER_08]: Actually, it wasn't Dan who was giving me the headache, it was watching his friend who completely sucks at that game being like an absolute retard playing it.

204
00:19:23,033 --> 00:19:27,436
[SPEAKER_08]: So, uh, I, uh, I mean, he was really making some dumb mistakes.

205
00:19:27,896 --> 00:19:34,480
[SPEAKER_08]: So, uh, I just sort of laid back and threw a pillow in Dan's lap and passed out.

206
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:37,222
[SPEAKER_08]: And I actually did fall asleep for something like two hours.

207
00:19:38,843 --> 00:19:39,904
[SPEAKER_22]: But you're sick, so you can't.

208
00:19:40,164 --> 00:19:41,825
[SPEAKER_08]: I still feel crappy.

209
00:19:43,956 --> 00:19:44,856
[SPEAKER_22]: DarkSakura, how was your week?

210
00:19:44,936 --> 00:19:45,557
[SPEAKER_22]: How was your day?

211
00:19:45,577 --> 00:19:46,237
[SPEAKER_22]: How was my month?

212
00:19:46,277 --> 00:19:47,358
[SPEAKER_22]: How was your month?

213
00:19:47,418 --> 00:19:48,798
[SPEAKER_08]: It's been a little while since I've been here.

214
00:20:14,597 --> 00:20:18,001
[SPEAKER_08]: It involves lung cookies and homework and that's about it.

215
00:20:18,963 --> 00:20:20,525
[SPEAKER_08]: I slept 16 hours yesterday.

216
00:20:21,225 --> 00:20:22,847
[SPEAKER_08]: I slept 17 hours last Saturday.

217
00:20:24,159 --> 00:20:28,503
[SPEAKER_08]: I had lung spasms at work Friday and had to go home the week before.

218
00:20:30,685 --> 00:20:37,511
[SPEAKER_08]: I've been really, really crappy sick and haven't even felt much like playing anything, let alone sitting up and going to work.

219
00:20:38,552 --> 00:20:42,635
[SPEAKER_08]: I opened World of Warcraft and then shut it down.

220
00:20:43,556 --> 00:20:46,879
[SPEAKER_08]: And then last night around 1am I played some We Love Katamari.

221
00:20:48,433 --> 00:20:49,933
[SPEAKER_08]: and then started getting really motion sick.

222
00:20:51,474 --> 00:20:55,955
[SPEAKER_08]: It's like my stomach has gone between being ravenously hungry and being very nauseated.

223
00:20:56,595 --> 00:21:03,057
[SPEAKER_08]: So, trying to play Wheel of Katamari while being highly nauseated anyway just spells disaster.

224
00:21:03,737 --> 00:21:06,418
[SPEAKER_08]: Spells don't make any plans because it's all coming up.

225
00:21:08,339 --> 00:21:10,119
[SPEAKER_22]: That's one way of explaining it, I suppose.

226
00:21:10,659 --> 00:21:10,999
[SPEAKER_22]: All right.

227
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:12,420
[SPEAKER_22]: Loki, how was your week?

228
00:21:12,460 --> 00:21:12,800
[SPEAKER_22]: How was your day?

229
00:21:13,359 --> 00:21:15,281
[SPEAKER_02]: My week was good because there was turkey involved.

230
00:21:16,542 --> 00:21:19,244
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, you know, it was a very chaotic week.

231
00:21:19,264 --> 00:21:20,665
[SPEAKER_02]: I got my car fixed, finally.

232
00:21:22,046 --> 00:21:23,167
[SPEAKER_02]: And that was cool.

233
00:21:23,647 --> 00:21:24,628
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I had turkey.

234
00:21:25,069 --> 00:21:25,869
[SPEAKER_02]: That was also good.

235
00:21:26,750 --> 00:21:31,254
[SPEAKER_02]: Then the rest of the week, you know, the last four days was really trying to be productive, but that didn't happen.

236
00:21:31,654 --> 00:21:31,774
[SPEAKER_02]: So...

237
00:21:33,686 --> 00:21:38,567
[SPEAKER_02]: No, instead I kind of wandered around on Black Friday trying to see if there was any 360s around.

238
00:21:39,607 --> 00:21:40,827
[SPEAKER_22]: Oh, give me a break.

239
00:21:40,968 --> 00:21:44,248
[SPEAKER_22]: I mean, did you really think you were going to find a 360 on Black Friday?

240
00:21:45,588 --> 00:21:47,529
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I just wanted to get out of the house.

241
00:21:47,549 --> 00:21:48,589
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, okay.

242
00:21:49,029 --> 00:21:52,130
[SPEAKER_02]: So I went and picked up another game for the 360 I don't have yet.

243
00:21:52,710 --> 00:21:53,770
[SPEAKER_02]: So I have Cameo now.

244
00:21:53,950 --> 00:21:55,230
[SPEAKER_02]: Luckily, there's a used copy.

245
00:21:55,290 --> 00:21:56,811
[SPEAKER_02]: Someone already put out a used copy.

246
00:21:57,691 --> 00:21:58,711
[SPEAKER_22]: That's interesting.

247
00:21:59,491 --> 00:22:01,152
[SPEAKER_22]: It's probably a review copy or something.

248
00:22:01,972 --> 00:22:02,752
[SPEAKER_22]: Something like that.

249
00:22:03,188 --> 00:22:05,189
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, not like any of the copies I bring back are.

250
00:22:05,990 --> 00:22:10,412
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyways, then I went to Best Buy and wandered around there for about a few seconds.

251
00:22:11,072 --> 00:22:17,936
[SPEAKER_02]: They have quite a few Xboxes and the PS2 Slims.

252
00:22:17,976 --> 00:22:19,697
[SPEAKER_02]: They were blocking off aisles with them.

253
00:22:20,177 --> 00:22:23,619
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, okay, I get the point that you have lots of these systems available.

254
00:22:24,219 --> 00:22:27,161
[SPEAKER_02]: Not the one I'm looking for, but I don't know.

255
00:22:27,341 --> 00:22:28,782
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just kind of fed up with Best Buy.

256
00:22:28,942 --> 00:22:33,186
[SPEAKER_22]: Dude, why were people lined up at 10 o'clock Thanksgiving evening outside Best Buy?

257
00:22:33,286 --> 00:22:35,107
[SPEAKER_22]: Like, they were camped out for Black Friday?

258
00:22:36,788 --> 00:22:41,512
[SPEAKER_10]: Can you give a microphone to make it sound... There were, like, computers for, like, $150.

259
00:22:41,632 --> 00:22:42,173
[SPEAKER_22]: Decent ones?

260
00:22:42,553 --> 00:22:43,054
[SPEAKER_10]: I think so.

261
00:22:43,214 --> 00:22:44,034
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, and laptops for, like, $200.

262
00:22:44,134 --> 00:22:44,235
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

263
00:22:44,375 --> 00:22:44,495
[SPEAKER_10]: Wow.

264
00:22:44,775 --> 00:22:46,356
[SPEAKER_22]: I don't know.

265
00:22:46,396 --> 00:22:47,597
[SPEAKER_22]: Hell, maybe I should have camped out, too.

266
00:22:48,438 --> 00:22:51,040
[SPEAKER_02]: They had some HP computers or something.

267
00:22:51,060 --> 00:22:51,521
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

268
00:22:53,182 --> 00:22:54,323
[SPEAKER_02]: I just didn't really want it.

269
00:22:55,344 --> 00:22:56,765
[SPEAKER_22]: Didn't Walmart do some type of, like...

270
00:22:58,658 --> 00:23:01,680
[SPEAKER_02]: They were talking about it, and I don't know if they did or not.

271
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:03,461
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a big mess.

272
00:23:04,121 --> 00:23:11,285
[SPEAKER_02]: But I actually went to GameStop that day, thinking, oh, well, the GameStop by my house is normally not crowded at all.

273
00:23:11,345 --> 00:23:15,308
[SPEAKER_02]: They had like a freaking line of seven people in there at about noon.

274
00:23:15,788 --> 00:23:16,428
[SPEAKER_02]: It was crazy.

275
00:23:17,249 --> 00:23:21,691
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I wanted to see, first off, where it was on the Xbox 360 pre-orders, and also...

276
00:23:25,333 --> 00:23:29,494
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, whether or not they had any accessories and stuff and possibly games.

277
00:23:29,954 --> 00:23:36,635
[SPEAKER_02]: But now I'm to the point now I have the four games I kind of wanted and there's really nothing else I want except for maybe DOA 4.

278
00:23:37,216 --> 00:23:40,576
[SPEAKER_02]: But once that comes out, there's nothing I want for at least a few months.

279
00:23:41,116 --> 00:23:49,218
[SPEAKER_02]: And actually, looking at my list of games coming out, there's nothing coming out for the 360 until February.

280
00:23:50,678 --> 00:23:53,359
[SPEAKER_22]: It's like PSP Syndrome all over again or Nintendo DS.

281
00:23:53,379 --> 00:23:53,559
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah.

282
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:55,341
[SPEAKER_02]: That's crazy, though.

283
00:23:55,361 --> 00:24:05,529
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, even... I mean, excluding the delay on Dead or Alive 4, you would actually have two months of nothing for the 360, and I mean, that's pretty bad.

284
00:24:05,729 --> 00:24:06,970
[SPEAKER_22]: When's that Baldur's Gate coming out?

285
00:24:07,030 --> 00:24:08,191
[SPEAKER_22]: Did that get pushed all the way back to February?

286
00:24:08,211 --> 00:24:09,672
[SPEAKER_02]: Elder Scrolls is coming out in April or March.

287
00:24:09,692 --> 00:24:10,853
[SPEAKER_22]: Why did I say Baldur's Gate?

288
00:24:11,633 --> 00:24:14,175
[SPEAKER_02]: It's Elder Scrolls... I think March now.

289
00:24:14,976 --> 00:24:16,197
[SPEAKER_02]: March or April, I can't remember.

290
00:24:17,678 --> 00:24:21,101
[SPEAKER_02]: The only big games coming out... December is nothing.

291
00:24:21,501 --> 00:24:23,803
[SPEAKER_02]: The only real game worth mentioning is actually...

292
00:24:24,943 --> 00:24:27,145
[SPEAKER_02]: and just Gauntlet Seven Sorrows.

293
00:24:27,265 --> 00:24:27,685
[SPEAKER_02]: That's it.

294
00:24:28,225 --> 00:24:30,707
[SPEAKER_02]: That and Dead or Alive because Dead or Alive got pushed back.

295
00:24:30,767 --> 00:24:34,289
[SPEAKER_22]: Gauntlet Seven Sorrows is also coming out on the other systems too, so it doesn't really matter.

296
00:24:34,729 --> 00:24:35,349
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that's not on the 360.

297
00:24:35,689 --> 00:24:37,130
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just talking games in general.

298
00:24:37,410 --> 00:24:37,811
[SPEAKER_22]: Oh, shit.

299
00:24:37,971 --> 00:24:43,694
[SPEAKER_02]: And then for the month of January, 25 to Life, which would be pretty big.

300
00:24:44,451 --> 00:24:56,498
[SPEAKER_22]: Well, there's really... January is a very slow period for games, just as it is for movies, because after the holidays, there's really nothing up again until, you know, I don't know, early spring period.

301
00:24:56,538 --> 00:25:01,321
[SPEAKER_22]: Probably, there's going to be a very big lull between the holidays and probably summer.

302
00:25:01,742 --> 00:25:02,382
[SPEAKER_22]: There usually is.

303
00:25:02,922 --> 00:25:06,204
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it should be... You get a couple big titles in February.

304
00:25:06,385 --> 00:25:08,666
[SPEAKER_22]: I think we're getting Prime Hunters on the DS somewhere in there.

305
00:25:08,926 --> 00:25:09,326
[SPEAKER_22]: March?

306
00:25:09,486 --> 00:25:09,767
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah.

307
00:25:10,347 --> 00:25:11,888
[SPEAKER_22]: Well, you get a couple big titles, but that's about it.

308
00:25:13,575 --> 00:25:20,640
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm thinking now I've got to put down my money for a Revolution and a PS3 if I want them.

309
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:25,203
[SPEAKER_02]: PS3 I'm not so worried about because they haven't even really announced a date for that yet.

310
00:25:25,383 --> 00:25:29,866
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm thinking it's not going to be until the fall anyways of next year.

311
00:25:30,996 --> 00:25:32,738
[SPEAKER_02]: Revolution, though, I'd be wanting to pick up.

312
00:25:32,938 --> 00:25:35,760
[SPEAKER_22]: I think Revolution and PS3 will both be out by next Christmas, I really do.

313
00:25:36,081 --> 00:25:39,864
[SPEAKER_22]: I think they're going to rush them just like Xbox rushed to get out there, but I think they'll be out there by Christmas.

314
00:25:39,884 --> 00:25:41,546
[SPEAKER_02]: Revolution, they've been taking their time on, so.

315
00:25:41,686 --> 00:25:45,489
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, but I think, you know, the fact that they haven't said a lot about it, I think is a good sign.

316
00:25:45,970 --> 00:25:48,392
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's going to be like a Nintendo 64 launch.

317
00:25:50,874 --> 00:25:51,175
[SPEAKER_22]: Comment?

318
00:25:51,795 --> 00:25:52,236
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry.

319
00:25:52,876 --> 00:25:56,740
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm just seeing the 360 going the way of the Dreamcast.

320
00:25:57,924 --> 00:25:58,384
[SPEAKER_22]: Interesting.

321
00:25:58,425 --> 00:25:59,425
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a lot in common.

322
00:25:59,986 --> 00:26:06,792
[SPEAKER_22]: I saw that story on 1up.com that shared what they had in common, but that's the same marketing guys behind them both, isn't it?

323
00:26:07,632 --> 00:26:08,693
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't get the commercials.

324
00:26:08,753 --> 00:26:09,354
[SPEAKER_02]: They're stupid.

325
00:26:10,074 --> 00:26:11,676
[SPEAKER_22]: I haven't even seen an Xbox 360 commercial.

326
00:26:11,776 --> 00:26:18,241
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you probably don't even realize it is an Xbox 360 commercial unless you watch it all the way through because they don't say or show anything about the Xbox 360.

327
00:26:18,281 --> 00:26:23,986
[SPEAKER_02]: They show kids playing and really cryptic, artistic crap, and then they go, Xbox 360!

328
00:26:25,007 --> 00:26:28,471
[SPEAKER_02]: It reminds me of this commercial we made for our economics class.

329
00:26:29,051 --> 00:26:33,175
[SPEAKER_02]: It was basically a bunch of kick-ass clips of action sequences during movies.

330
00:26:33,575 --> 00:26:36,778
[SPEAKER_02]: Like explosions and people getting beat up and stuff.

331
00:26:36,838 --> 00:26:38,880
[SPEAKER_02]: And at the very end, buy bumper stickers.

332
00:26:39,301 --> 00:26:39,981
[SPEAKER_02]: And that was it.

333
00:26:40,222 --> 00:26:40,982
[SPEAKER_02]: That was the whole thing.

334
00:26:41,022 --> 00:26:45,267
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is kind of like the whole 360 thing.

335
00:26:45,587 --> 00:26:49,751
[SPEAKER_02]: You show a bunch of kids playing and having a water balloon fight or something.

336
00:26:50,291 --> 00:26:52,334
[SPEAKER_02]: 360, it's like, you look at it and you're like, what the hell?

337
00:26:52,374 --> 00:26:52,835
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't get it.

338
00:26:52,875 --> 00:26:56,400
[SPEAKER_02]: That doesn't say anything about the system, what it does, what it is.

339
00:26:56,901 --> 00:26:58,143
[SPEAKER_02]: It just shows kids playing.

340
00:26:58,423 --> 00:27:01,868
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so the 360 is a watermelon launcher?

341
00:27:01,928 --> 00:27:02,930
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, what the hell is it?

342
00:27:05,233 --> 00:27:05,714
[SPEAKER_22]: It's stupid.

343
00:27:08,341 --> 00:27:14,564
[SPEAKER_22]: I barely watch TV at all, and even the few shows I do watch, thanks to the lovely DVR we have, I fast forward through all the commercials.

344
00:27:14,805 --> 00:27:16,886
[SPEAKER_22]: So I don't have to watch it.

345
00:27:16,906 --> 00:27:18,887
[SPEAKER_22]: So that's why I'm like, oh, there's a funny commercial?

346
00:27:18,947 --> 00:27:19,267
[SPEAKER_22]: I don't know.

347
00:27:20,328 --> 00:27:20,548
[SPEAKER_22]: Anyway.

348
00:27:21,449 --> 00:27:22,809
[SPEAKER_22]: Anything else you want to share about your week and your day?

349
00:27:23,810 --> 00:27:25,251
[SPEAKER_02]: No, that's pretty much it.

350
00:27:25,291 --> 00:27:32,936
[SPEAKER_22]: My week and my day, I went to GameStop on Black Friday as well, but I went to the one near here, and the line was only about one, two people, like it usually is.

351
00:27:33,016 --> 00:27:33,236
[SPEAKER_22]: Nothing...

352
00:27:33,629 --> 00:27:34,029
[SPEAKER_22]: Dragon Quest VIII

353
00:28:00,431 --> 00:28:02,752
[SPEAKER_22]: And it looked pretty cool, so I wanted to pick it up and play it.

354
00:28:04,593 --> 00:28:06,914
[SPEAKER_22]: And also the Final Fantasy XII demo, which is very, very sexy.

355
00:28:07,134 --> 00:28:09,295
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm going to let you borrow it so you can see it, because it's very sexy.

356
00:28:10,216 --> 00:28:10,616
[SPEAKER_02]: No need.

357
00:28:10,636 --> 00:28:11,536
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, you already got it?

358
00:28:13,817 --> 00:28:14,237
[SPEAKER_02]: I found it.

359
00:28:14,678 --> 00:28:16,238
[SPEAKER_02]: You acquired it.

360
00:28:16,258 --> 00:28:17,119
[SPEAKER_02]: I acquired it.

361
00:28:17,319 --> 00:28:19,540
[SPEAKER_22]: You acquired it through your various contacts.

362
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:21,181
[SPEAKER_22]: Do you need it, or do you already have it?

363
00:28:21,401 --> 00:28:24,462
[SPEAKER_22]: Because I'll let you borrow the Final Fantasy XII demo, which is pretty cool.

364
00:28:25,450 --> 00:28:26,412
[SPEAKER_08]: I have the trailer.

365
00:28:27,194 --> 00:28:28,476
[SPEAKER_22]: It's a playable demo.

366
00:28:28,656 --> 00:28:29,337
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, no I don't.

367
00:28:29,438 --> 00:28:30,980
[SPEAKER_22]: You want to borrow it?

368
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:31,181
[SPEAKER_08]: Sure.

369
00:28:31,581 --> 00:28:31,962
[SPEAKER_22]: Very cool.

370
00:28:32,964 --> 00:28:33,885
[SPEAKER_02]: Sounds like it was like 11.

371
00:28:33,926 --> 00:28:36,811
[SPEAKER_08]: I just got the Dragon Warrior 9 or whatever one.

372
00:28:38,927 --> 00:28:40,508
[SPEAKER_08]: Whatever the new Dragon Quest is.

373
00:28:40,528 --> 00:28:41,048
[SPEAKER_08]: Dragon Quest.

374
00:28:41,068 --> 00:28:42,588
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, about the actual game, Dragon Quest VIII.

375
00:28:42,608 --> 00:28:43,948
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm the one saying Dragon Warrior.

376
00:28:44,729 --> 00:28:45,389
[SPEAKER_22]: Dragon Quest.

377
00:28:45,409 --> 00:28:47,909
[SPEAKER_22]: Well, they went back to Dragon Quest.

378
00:28:47,929 --> 00:28:50,950
[SPEAKER_22]: Because Squeenix is doing this whole mea culpa.

379
00:28:50,990 --> 00:28:53,550
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes, we did change the names of all your games.

380
00:28:53,591 --> 00:28:54,931
[SPEAKER_22]: We released them in the U.S.

381
00:28:54,971 --> 00:28:56,151
[SPEAKER_22]: for Nintendo.

382
00:28:56,331 --> 00:28:57,111
[SPEAKER_22]: Here, we fix.

383
00:28:57,331 --> 00:28:57,811
[SPEAKER_22]: We fix.

384
00:28:59,732 --> 00:29:01,412
[SPEAKER_22]: I'll talk more about Dragon Quest on the podcast.

385
00:29:01,452 --> 00:29:03,373
[SPEAKER_22]: But, yeah, I like that game.

386
00:29:03,893 --> 00:29:04,033
[SPEAKER_22]: And...

387
00:29:05,350 --> 00:29:17,415
[SPEAKER_22]: I've been playing a little bit of Mario Kart here and there, and World of Warcraft, a little bit, a little bit, not a whole lot though, and that's about it.

388
00:29:20,376 --> 00:29:24,097
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm using the crappy mic tonight, so if my voice fades in and out just because I'm on the crappy mic tonight.

389
00:29:26,458 --> 00:29:31,840
[SPEAKER_22]: I didn't really do anything for Thanksgiving, because I have a small family, so it's just me, my mom, and my dad, so we just went out to eat.

390
00:29:32,298 --> 00:29:33,079
[SPEAKER_22]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura.com

391
00:29:55,970 --> 00:29:56,430
[SPEAKER_22]: That's about it.

392
00:29:57,711 --> 00:30:05,653
[SPEAKER_22]: It's just been very nice to have these past few days off of work, because I'm not going to have a vacation like this again until like February, because I'm taking some massive time off in February.

393
00:30:06,213 --> 00:30:09,114
[SPEAKER_22]: And it's just very nice to have a break.

394
00:30:09,435 --> 00:30:10,435
[SPEAKER_22]: So I feel very charged.

395
00:30:10,455 --> 00:30:11,675
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm very relaxed tonight.

396
00:30:14,056 --> 00:30:14,596
[SPEAKER_22]: I hate this mic.

397
00:30:14,616 --> 00:30:16,457
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm in a pretty decent mood, all things considered.

398
00:30:16,477 --> 00:30:18,718
[SPEAKER_22]: But yeah.

399
00:30:19,955 --> 00:30:21,216
[SPEAKER_22]: So, Miklatov, you're here.

400
00:30:21,236 --> 00:30:24,517
[SPEAKER_22]: I know you're in the middle of a race, but you gotta pause that for a minute.

401
00:30:25,177 --> 00:30:32,800
[SPEAKER_22]: And of course, we have to give the disclaimer that, you know, even though he works for Konami, don't read into too much anything that he says, because he's not here to represent Konami tonight, he's here to represent himself.

402
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:33,580
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes?

403
00:30:33,780 --> 00:30:34,421
[SPEAKER_10]: As usual.

404
00:30:34,601 --> 00:30:35,001
[SPEAKER_22]: As usual.

405
00:30:35,301 --> 00:30:36,421
[SPEAKER_22]: So, how was your week?

406
00:30:36,441 --> 00:30:36,902
[SPEAKER_22]: How was your day?

407
00:30:37,382 --> 00:30:39,563
[SPEAKER_10]: My week was pretty boring, because all I do is work.

408
00:30:40,983 --> 00:30:45,185
[SPEAKER_10]: Mario Kart has taken over our office every break, almost every lunch.

409
00:30:45,685 --> 00:30:47,366
[SPEAKER_10]: We play eight-player matches.

410
00:30:47,426 --> 00:30:48,006
[SPEAKER_10]: It's really fun.

411
00:30:48,624 --> 00:30:52,674
[SPEAKER_22]: I love hearing that at Konami you'll play games by other people all the time.

412
00:30:52,895 --> 00:30:54,359
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm sure all the other companies do it too.

413
00:30:54,399 --> 00:30:55,020
[SPEAKER_22]: It's just kind of neat.

414
00:30:55,902 --> 00:30:56,242
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

415
00:30:56,682 --> 00:31:04,385
[SPEAKER_10]: We even use our DSs that we're not supposed to use for actual gaming to play, because not everybody has a DS there.

416
00:31:05,205 --> 00:31:08,726
[SPEAKER_10]: And then I saw Rent, which is an amazing movie.

417
00:31:09,206 --> 00:31:11,547
[SPEAKER_10]: Don't say anything, Rob.

418
00:31:11,627 --> 00:31:12,247
[SPEAKER_22]: It's your moment.

419
00:31:12,307 --> 00:31:13,167
[SPEAKER_22]: I'll let you have your moment.

420
00:31:13,187 --> 00:31:13,688
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a great movie.

421
00:31:13,728 --> 00:31:14,808
[SPEAKER_10]: I saw it twice, actually.

422
00:31:16,689 --> 00:31:21,610
[SPEAKER_10]: And I picked up Brokeback Mountain.

423
00:31:22,110 --> 00:31:24,071
[SPEAKER_10]: Two books of it and the soundtrack.

424
00:31:25,983 --> 00:31:28,406
[SPEAKER_22]: How do you buy two books of Brokeback Mountain?

425
00:31:28,927 --> 00:31:31,370
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, they released a standalone.

426
00:31:31,410 --> 00:31:36,296
[SPEAKER_10]: It's really just a short story from a collection of cowboy western stories.

427
00:31:37,048 --> 00:31:46,033
[SPEAKER_10]: So I picked up the book that had all those short stories in it, and then they also released the one for the movie that's coming out, and I picked that one up also, and the soundtrack.

428
00:31:46,933 --> 00:31:47,754
[SPEAKER_10]: And I'm in love.

429
00:31:48,794 --> 00:31:49,175
[SPEAKER_10]: A lot.

430
00:31:49,535 --> 00:31:49,855
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

431
00:31:50,315 --> 00:31:51,316
[SPEAKER_10]: And the movie comes out when?

432
00:31:51,576 --> 00:31:52,516
[SPEAKER_10]: December 9th.

433
00:31:52,676 --> 00:31:58,399
[SPEAKER_10]: I thought it was next week, and then to my horrible, horrible dismay, it's actually two weeks from now.

434
00:31:59,540 --> 00:32:03,202
[SPEAKER_10]: So now next week's going to be depressing, because that's all I was looking forward to.

435
00:32:03,342 --> 00:32:03,742
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm sorry.

436
00:32:04,383 --> 00:32:04,583
[SPEAKER_10]: It's okay.

437
00:32:04,603 --> 00:32:04,763
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

438
00:32:05,256 --> 00:32:05,656
[SPEAKER_22]: and many more.

439
00:32:23,268 --> 00:32:29,694
[SPEAKER_22]: Anything that you've by chance maybe been spinning a turntable or making some arrow-stomping noises to?

440
00:32:29,914 --> 00:32:31,576
[SPEAKER_22]: I refuse to comment.

441
00:32:33,037 --> 00:32:33,618
[SPEAKER_22]: I have to try.

442
00:32:33,658 --> 00:32:36,680
[SPEAKER_22]: The listeners would get angry and say that, you know, we're a farce if I didn't try.

443
00:32:36,780 --> 00:32:38,021
[SPEAKER_22]: The Mario Kart music.

444
00:32:39,202 --> 00:32:45,908
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, and a lot of random 90s music I've been listening to at work lately, but nothing to do with DDR or anything like that, so don't read into that.

445
00:32:45,928 --> 00:32:47,330
[SPEAKER_10]: Just, that's what I play when I'm doing...

446
00:32:49,619 --> 00:32:51,481
[SPEAKER_10]: So I hear Rhythm Is A Dancer a lot.

447
00:32:52,822 --> 00:32:53,763
[SPEAKER_22]: I don't know if I can say it.

448
00:32:54,304 --> 00:33:00,390
[SPEAKER_22]: There was something that happened once that involved work and somebody hearing a song a lot that was really, really funny that happened once.

449
00:33:00,410 --> 00:33:01,291
[SPEAKER_10]: Damien Busters?

450
00:33:01,571 --> 00:33:02,972
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, can I say that on the air?

451
00:33:03,032 --> 00:33:03,413
[SPEAKER_22]: I don't know.

452
00:33:04,154 --> 00:33:06,156
[SPEAKER_22]: It's in the past, so I can say that now, right?

453
00:33:06,896 --> 00:33:07,677
[SPEAKER_22]: I won't say who it was.

454
00:33:07,777 --> 00:33:08,678
[SPEAKER_22]: I'll just say somebody.

455
00:33:08,738 --> 00:33:09,459
[SPEAKER_22]: It wasn't in the past.

456
00:33:09,479 --> 00:33:13,423
[SPEAKER_22]: Somebody who also is very close with Konami said... Used to be.

457
00:33:13,743 --> 00:33:14,643
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, well, whatever.

458
00:33:15,484 --> 00:33:30,151
[SPEAKER_22]: It was this song that was playing on the Dave & Buster's radio station, and she said, or he or she said, shit, he or she said, he or she said that, fuck, I don't know if I can do this story now.

459
00:33:30,251 --> 00:33:32,872
[SPEAKER_22]: Now our picture is falling down the stairs.

460
00:33:34,053 --> 00:33:36,915
[SPEAKER_22]: I don't know if I can continue this story now because I don't want to get anybody in trouble.

461
00:33:37,355 --> 00:33:38,155
[SPEAKER_22]: They don't work there anymore.

462
00:33:38,235 --> 00:33:39,516
[SPEAKER_22]: Alright, it's fine.

463
00:33:39,916 --> 00:33:47,600
[SPEAKER_22]: The person said that, oh man, I can't get this song out of my head because I've been hearing it at work so much lately and I'm like, oh really?

464
00:33:48,340 --> 00:33:50,862
[SPEAKER_22]: Turns out it was an Ultramix 2 license that nobody knew about yet.

465
00:33:52,062 --> 00:33:55,083
[SPEAKER_22]: And the rest of my week was watching that next clip constantly

466
00:34:12,228 --> 00:34:12,588
[SPEAKER_10]: Next Next Next

467
00:34:28,815 --> 00:34:36,825
[SPEAKER_10]: So she's walking out of the van thing, and she's doing her little spiel for the camera, and as she's saying that, she falls down the steps.

468
00:34:37,565 --> 00:34:44,273
[SPEAKER_10]: It's really funny because they freeze frame on her falling down, and she has the best expression on her face.

469
00:34:45,347 --> 00:34:48,068
[SPEAKER_22]: It's somewhere between laughing and just shock.

470
00:34:48,328 --> 00:34:49,049
[SPEAKER_22]: It's really great.

471
00:34:49,929 --> 00:34:52,310
[SPEAKER_22]: And she was a stupid whore anyway.

472
00:34:53,810 --> 00:34:58,712
[SPEAKER_02]: I love how he's like, so I just wanted you to walk over here because I wasn't sure if you were okay or not.

473
00:34:59,013 --> 00:34:59,433
[SPEAKER_02]: Next.

474
00:35:00,733 --> 00:35:02,574
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that was nice.

475
00:35:04,432 --> 00:35:04,832
[SPEAKER_22]: Let's see.

476
00:35:06,173 --> 00:35:08,233
[SPEAKER_22]: Oh, I know what I wanted to ask you about as well.

477
00:35:09,253 --> 00:35:14,495
[SPEAKER_22]: One little work-related thing that I'm okay to say, I think, is that you met LED.

478
00:35:14,675 --> 00:35:15,435
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I met LED.

479
00:35:15,455 --> 00:35:15,895
[SPEAKER_10]: How was that?

480
00:35:16,075 --> 00:35:17,415
[SPEAKER_10]: I got to have dinner with LED.

481
00:35:17,615 --> 00:35:18,215
[SPEAKER_10]: Really?

482
00:35:18,255 --> 00:35:19,036
[SPEAKER_22]: Was it a nice dinner?

483
00:35:19,056 --> 00:35:20,496
[SPEAKER_22]: Did you guys go to a fancy restaurant?

484
00:35:20,536 --> 00:35:23,357
[SPEAKER_10]: We went to TGI Fridays, because he wanted American.

485
00:35:23,657 --> 00:35:24,417
[SPEAKER_22]: Well, that's good stuff.

486
00:35:24,557 --> 00:35:25,197
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, it was pretty good.

487
00:35:25,797 --> 00:35:28,778
[SPEAKER_22]: You probably can't say much about the details of what you guys talked about, but...

488
00:35:29,598 --> 00:35:31,861
[SPEAKER_22]: Anything interesting that you might be able to share?

489
00:35:31,881 --> 00:35:35,126
[SPEAKER_22]: Does he seem to be aware that he has quite a following here in the U.S.? ?

490
00:35:44,733 --> 00:35:51,015
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't think that was brought up, but I think he would have to be stupid to know that.

491
00:35:53,335 --> 00:35:57,756
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know what I can really say from the dinner, but there was one funny thing.

492
00:35:57,796 --> 00:36:04,478
[SPEAKER_10]: It was me and a couple other people from work, and he asked us what types of music we listened to.

493
00:36:05,919 --> 00:36:11,060
[SPEAKER_10]: At the time, it was like I was listening to drum and bass a lot, and I also said Eurobeat.

494
00:36:11,574 --> 00:36:16,437
[SPEAKER_10]: and he kind of groaned and said Eurobeat after me.

495
00:36:16,818 --> 00:36:18,639
[SPEAKER_10]: He was rather disgusted with that answer.

496
00:36:19,539 --> 00:36:20,520
[SPEAKER_22]: I thought it was funny.

497
00:36:20,580 --> 00:36:21,601
[SPEAKER_22]: You make LED cry.

498
00:36:21,621 --> 00:36:22,721
[SPEAKER_10]: I do.

499
00:36:24,002 --> 00:36:24,583
[SPEAKER_22]: That's great.

500
00:36:24,683 --> 00:36:25,423
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, it was funny.

501
00:36:25,563 --> 00:36:26,064
[SPEAKER_22]: That's cool.

502
00:36:26,844 --> 00:36:27,164
[SPEAKER_22]: Good job.

503
00:36:28,065 --> 00:36:29,886
[SPEAKER_22]: Alright, moving on.

504
00:36:30,146 --> 00:36:31,307
[SPEAKER_22]: If you have nothing else to say for now.

505
00:36:32,087 --> 00:36:33,308
[SPEAKER_22]: Nope.

506
00:36:33,989 --> 00:36:35,029
[SPEAKER_22]: Brokeback Mountain's awesome.

507
00:36:36,607 --> 00:36:42,192
[SPEAKER_22]: Let's go, okay, since we can't ask these things of Miklatov, we can mention them ourselves if we pick stuff up along the wire.

508
00:36:42,232 --> 00:36:44,053
[SPEAKER_22]: Something about Beatmania getting pushed back again?

509
00:36:44,073 --> 00:36:44,354
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah.

510
00:36:44,374 --> 00:36:44,974
[SPEAKER_22]: You found this out?

511
00:36:45,054 --> 00:36:45,475
[SPEAKER_22]: What happened?

512
00:36:45,835 --> 00:36:47,336
[SPEAKER_02]: It's, dates changed.

513
00:36:48,617 --> 00:36:53,702
[SPEAKER_02]: We get updates like at least once a week from like all the different companies when stuff's coming out.

514
00:36:54,322 --> 00:37:03,270
[SPEAKER_02]: And the tentative date of, what was it, like February 9th is no longer, it's now being pushed back to March something.

515
00:37:03,669 --> 00:37:12,515
[SPEAKER_22]: You know what I think is interesting is that finally after this website's been running for about three and a half years now, people are considering us like a legitimate news source.

516
00:37:12,575 --> 00:37:17,818
[SPEAKER_22]: Just for the record, remind our audience where you get your information and why it's pretty reliable.

517
00:37:18,277 --> 00:37:25,244
[SPEAKER_02]: My information comes directly from our buyer because our buyer talks to Konami directly.

518
00:37:25,344 --> 00:37:31,389
[SPEAKER_02]: They give us the dates so we know when product's coming out, so we know when we can sell it, when orders are due, etc.

519
00:37:31,489 --> 00:37:39,216
[SPEAKER_02]: So we have to know what the upcoming slate of titles is going to be and that's how I know what movie titles and game titles because...

520
00:37:40,117 --> 00:37:44,702
[SPEAKER_02]: I work at a friggin' distributor, so you have to know what's coming out when.

521
00:37:44,822 --> 00:37:46,504
[SPEAKER_02]: So, that's the tentative date.

522
00:37:47,005 --> 00:37:51,630
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, like most games, dates shift around, like, weekly.

523
00:37:51,890 --> 00:37:58,818
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, what might be March today, could be January, could be April, who knows.

524
00:37:59,599 --> 00:38:00,340
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, for example...

525
00:38:01,460 --> 00:38:06,183
[SPEAKER_02]: Tomb Raider, the new one, Tomb Raider Legends or whatever it was.

526
00:38:06,243 --> 00:38:07,904
[SPEAKER_22]: The Tomb Raider, I don't care anymore.

527
00:38:07,964 --> 00:38:10,425
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, Tomb Raider, trying to reinvent ourselves, Tomb Raider.

528
00:38:10,845 --> 00:38:19,430
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, that game was originally slated for January, moved to April, moved back to January, moved back to April, moved back to January, and now it's in April.

529
00:38:19,970 --> 00:38:22,832
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like they can't figure out when they want to release a stupid game.

530
00:38:24,233 --> 00:38:25,333
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's a perfect example.

531
00:38:25,553 --> 00:38:27,634
[SPEAKER_02]: Usually Konami, though, they don't shift their dates around that much.

532
00:38:27,795 --> 00:38:28,335
[SPEAKER_02]: It's usually...

533
00:38:29,554 --> 00:38:32,175
[SPEAKER_02]: A couple, and once it gets closer to it, it's set in stone.

534
00:38:32,555 --> 00:38:35,796
[SPEAKER_02]: EA, on the other hand, they like shifting their dates all over the damn place.

535
00:38:36,196 --> 00:38:36,796
[SPEAKER_22]: How about Square?

536
00:38:38,177 --> 00:38:38,557
[SPEAKER_02]: Square?

537
00:38:38,897 --> 00:38:41,538
[SPEAKER_02]: Not so much, but not many Square games come out.

538
00:38:41,578 --> 00:38:44,539
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, that's what we've had two in the last four months.

539
00:38:44,619 --> 00:38:47,500
[SPEAKER_22]: Well, a question from the chat room, Advent Children, what's the status on that?

540
00:38:47,580 --> 00:38:49,140
[SPEAKER_22]: You know when that's slated to come out now?

541
00:38:49,240 --> 00:38:50,421
[SPEAKER_02]: That's to be announced still.

542
00:38:50,761 --> 00:38:51,001
[SPEAKER_02]: Really?

543
00:38:51,021 --> 00:38:53,281
[SPEAKER_02]: It was going to be in February.

544
00:38:54,402 --> 00:38:57,503
[SPEAKER_02]: Then it was actually slated for...

545
00:38:58,763 --> 00:39:05,348
[SPEAKER_02]: The end of January, and then now we have it as moratorium in our system, meaning that we don't have a date yet.

546
00:39:05,508 --> 00:39:05,949
[SPEAKER_22]: Weird.

547
00:39:06,329 --> 00:39:07,030
[SPEAKER_02]: When it's coming out.

548
00:39:07,070 --> 00:39:08,010
[SPEAKER_22]: Why are they doing that?

549
00:39:08,050 --> 00:39:10,472
[SPEAKER_22]: That's so crazy, because people are pirating this movie.

550
00:39:10,692 --> 00:39:15,356
[SPEAKER_22]: Maybe that's why they're doing it, because of the piracy, they're going to have to go back and add all these extras that people are going to want to buy the DVD for.

551
00:39:15,396 --> 00:39:21,781
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm thinking they're probably trying to, because people bitch and moan about the fact that they don't have good box sets over here or anything like that.

552
00:39:22,181 --> 00:39:24,763
[SPEAKER_02]: I talk to the Sony guy, I always yell at him every time he comes in.

553
00:39:25,043 --> 00:39:25,725
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for watching!

554
00:39:37,310 --> 00:39:39,391
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, because I knew more about it than they did.

555
00:39:39,831 --> 00:39:44,514
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, I was like, why aren't you releasing the box sets here?

556
00:39:44,534 --> 00:39:46,375
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're like, oh, I don't know.

557
00:39:46,395 --> 00:39:51,417
[SPEAKER_22]: Oh, yeah, because I'm sure that one guy who comes to your company makes all the calls on what they're going to be releasing.

558
00:39:51,437 --> 00:39:55,899
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, a lot of the people that come to our company, though, are senior sales or whatever.

559
00:39:55,939 --> 00:39:58,180
[SPEAKER_02]: So they do have somewhat of a say.

560
00:39:58,701 --> 00:40:00,822
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, they...

561
00:40:01,741 --> 00:40:02,041
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

562
00:40:02,301 --> 00:40:03,262
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know when it's coming out.

563
00:40:03,722 --> 00:40:04,742
[SPEAKER_02]: All I know is I've seen it.

564
00:40:04,882 --> 00:40:05,362
[SPEAKER_02]: It's cool.

565
00:40:06,443 --> 00:40:07,663
[SPEAKER_02]: Hopefully it'll be coming out.

566
00:40:08,464 --> 00:40:10,084
[SPEAKER_02]: But, I don't know.

567
00:40:10,144 --> 00:40:12,225
[SPEAKER_02]: I always keep the website updated.

568
00:40:12,325 --> 00:40:14,046
[SPEAKER_02]: I post when it changes.

569
00:40:14,609 --> 00:40:19,870
[SPEAKER_22]: Another comment from our chatroom, from Ranchan, chatroom, by the way, OrangeLaunchRadio.com, click on chat.

570
00:40:20,710 --> 00:40:22,751
[SPEAKER_22]: Rumors are leaking out about theatrical release.

571
00:40:23,211 --> 00:40:24,351
[SPEAKER_22]: That's kind of true.

572
00:40:24,411 --> 00:40:26,471
[SPEAKER_22]: This has been something that's kind of been circulating for a while now.

573
00:40:27,251 --> 00:40:30,712
[SPEAKER_22]: We mentioned this on a podcast like months ago because I don't even remember where I picked up this bug.

574
00:40:31,092 --> 00:40:33,493
[SPEAKER_22]: Now, I want to say it was sometime around E3.

575
00:40:33,953 --> 00:40:35,813
[SPEAKER_22]: I picked up a bug, no, it was later than E3.

576
00:40:36,113 --> 00:40:36,433
[SPEAKER_22]: I remember.

577
00:40:36,453 --> 00:40:40,014
[SPEAKER_22]: It was a friend of a friend kind of thing, so take it with a grain of salt, but...

578
00:40:40,814 --> 00:40:42,116
[SPEAKER_22]: Final Fantasy Advent Children and IMAX

579
00:40:55,273 --> 00:40:55,793
[SPEAKER_22]: Okay, maybe not.

580
00:40:55,913 --> 00:41:00,435
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, they have Polar Express running right now on IMAX, but I think it needs to be an IMAX.

581
00:41:00,795 --> 00:41:02,456
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, that'd be awesome if it was an IMAX.

582
00:41:03,016 --> 00:41:03,296
[SPEAKER_02]: Who knows?

583
00:41:03,436 --> 00:41:10,159
[SPEAKER_02]: And if that's the case, it's going to take a long time to, you know, to print digital to, you know, the IMAX film store.

584
00:41:10,179 --> 00:41:14,961
[SPEAKER_22]: Well, since the movie's all digital as it is, it won't take that long to enhance, so to speak, for the movie.

585
00:41:15,381 --> 00:41:15,721
[SPEAKER_02]: Not really.

586
00:41:15,741 --> 00:41:18,442
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah.

587
00:41:18,462 --> 00:41:20,763
[SPEAKER_22]: Let's go to break.

588
00:41:22,611 --> 00:41:25,232
[SPEAKER_22]: We'll be back with more Orange Lounge Radio after this.

589
00:43:13,912 --> 00:43:14,975
Thanks for watching!

590
00:44:12,909 --> 00:44:14,634
Thanks for watching!

591
00:44:48,231 --> 00:44:48,893
Thanks for watching!

592
00:45:51,673 --> 00:46:06,823
[SPEAKER_07]: You've got to forever The green grass blows and the wind is dancing It would be a much better sight With you, with me If you hadn't met me I'd be fine on my own, baby Never felt so lonely when you came along

593
00:46:20,531 --> 00:46:21,551
[SPEAKER_07]: and many more.

594
00:46:41,489 --> 00:46:42,410
Thank you for watching!

595
00:48:35,817 --> 00:48:39,679
[SPEAKER_22]: Orange Lounge Radio, Bomani Music, and more.

596
00:48:40,279 --> 00:48:41,180
[SPEAKER_15]: Perfect!

597
00:48:41,680 --> 00:48:57,027
[SPEAKER_22]: We're back here on Orange Lounge Radio, and that break you heard Come With Me from Ultramix 3, Final Countdown from 2DX4Style, You're Not Here from Silent Hill, and then it was in DDR Extreme as well, and from Keyboard Mania 2nd Mix, Akumajo Dracula Medley, which is also now in DDR Ultramix 3 as well.

598
00:48:57,367 --> 00:49:01,810
[SPEAKER_22]: By the way, speaking of Castlevania songs and Bomani, I don't know if you saw that early song list for Beatmania...

599
00:49:03,070 --> 00:49:06,414
[SPEAKER_22]: I still want to call it 13th style.

600
00:49:06,474 --> 00:49:07,776
[SPEAKER_22]: I know that's a taboo thing to do.

601
00:49:08,116 --> 00:49:09,257
[SPEAKER_22]: No, it's not 13th style.

602
00:49:09,297 --> 00:49:10,038
[SPEAKER_22]: It's distorted.

603
00:49:10,519 --> 00:49:16,385
[SPEAKER_22]: But it does have 13 in the title this time, so I'm going to call it 13th style until I get yelled at.

604
00:49:17,066 --> 00:49:18,748
[SPEAKER_22]: But no, it's supposed to have bloody tears in it.

605
00:49:19,028 --> 00:49:20,290
[SPEAKER_22]: What is this you just pulled up there?

606
00:49:35,992 --> 00:49:37,533
[SPEAKER_22]: That's Ragnarok Online 2?

607
00:49:51,262 --> 00:49:54,124
[SPEAKER_08]: This means that Jamie's going to be quitting World of Warcraft awfully soon.

608
00:49:54,604 --> 00:49:56,025
[SPEAKER_22]: It's very fluid.

609
00:49:56,825 --> 00:49:57,125
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

610
00:49:57,845 --> 00:50:02,928
[SPEAKER_22]: It's got a 3D fluid sense to it, where you're not warping into fights or anything.

611
00:50:03,488 --> 00:50:06,269
[SPEAKER_22]: Kind of reminds me of the Final Fantasy XII demo, I must say, actually.

612
00:50:06,750 --> 00:50:07,150
[SPEAKER_22]: A little bit.

613
00:50:07,390 --> 00:50:07,730
[SPEAKER_22]: A little bit.

614
00:50:07,750 --> 00:50:10,992
[SPEAKER_22]: Except you're by yourself, but of course that would be to be expected in an MMO.

615
00:50:11,372 --> 00:50:12,172
[SPEAKER_22]: That's Ragnarok 2.

616
00:50:13,153 --> 00:50:13,493
[SPEAKER_22]: Interesting.

617
00:50:13,513 --> 00:50:15,314
[SPEAKER_08]: And this is your customizing for your character.

618
00:50:16,905 --> 00:50:22,069
[SPEAKER_22]: Our chat room is yelling now for a link, so you better link them up.

619
00:50:24,130 --> 00:50:26,192
[SPEAKER_22]: Loki, you had some interesting observations on eBay?

620
00:50:26,652 --> 00:50:34,518
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, yeah, I was just looking at the... I was checking on there, there was this Beatmania final machine that was on sale for $99 before.

621
00:50:34,799 --> 00:50:38,301
[SPEAKER_02]: But I looked at the guy's other selling... He's selling some other Bomani stuff.

622
00:50:39,202 --> 00:50:40,463
[SPEAKER_02]: Keyboard Mania, third...

623
00:50:42,504 --> 00:50:42,884
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, $280.

624
00:50:43,245 --> 00:50:44,525
[SPEAKER_22]: Holy fuck, I want that.

625
00:50:44,645 --> 00:50:45,185
[SPEAKER_22]: Oh my god.

626
00:50:45,385 --> 00:50:47,326
[SPEAKER_22]: I don't know where I would put that in this little apartment.

627
00:50:47,346 --> 00:50:49,507
[SPEAKER_02]: City of Industry is where it's at if you want to pick it up.

628
00:50:49,527 --> 00:50:50,627
[SPEAKER_22]: Does that mean it's AI selling it?

629
00:50:50,647 --> 00:50:51,967
[SPEAKER_22]: But it's not.

630
00:50:51,987 --> 00:50:52,948
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think it's AI.

631
00:50:53,388 --> 00:50:56,609
[SPEAKER_02]: They're selling Dance Maniacs, Second Mix.

632
00:50:56,649 --> 00:50:57,309
[SPEAKER_08]: Hold on, what, Jamie?

633
00:50:57,429 --> 00:50:57,609
[SPEAKER_08]: What?

634
00:50:58,350 --> 00:51:02,151
[SPEAKER_08]: It had No Buy It Now on it and it had Many Days Left on the Bed when I looked at it.

635
00:51:04,832 --> 00:51:05,192
[SPEAKER_22]: Okay.

636
00:51:07,373 --> 00:51:08,133
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm sorry, go ahead, Loki.

637
00:51:09,014 --> 00:51:12,555
[SPEAKER_02]: They have a 2DX Red Machine for $5,100.

638
00:51:12,595 --> 00:51:16,816
[SPEAKER_02]: Beat Me at the final right now is only $152.50.

639
00:51:16,897 --> 00:51:19,937
[SPEAKER_02]: But they have a bunch of stuff.

640
00:51:19,997 --> 00:51:20,878
[SPEAKER_02]: Initial D3.

641
00:51:22,898 --> 00:51:27,200
[SPEAKER_02]: They have a Wang Dan Midnight Maximum Tune 2 Racing Machine for only $2,500.

642
00:51:28,702 --> 00:51:30,084
[SPEAKER_02]: Just a bunch of kick-ass stuff.

643
00:51:30,404 --> 00:51:39,075
[SPEAKER_02]: Drum Mania 5th, Guitar Freaks 5th, Dance Maniac 2nd, Extreme, and Boxing Mania.

644
00:51:41,027 --> 00:51:41,888
[SPEAKER_22]: Wow, that's pretty cool.

645
00:51:41,908 --> 00:51:47,132
[SPEAKER_22]: I wonder if that's AI unloading all that stuff, because you know Arcade Infinity had a lot of, and they're in City of Industry, or at least they're right next to it.

646
00:51:47,152 --> 00:51:48,373
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, we don't have a fifth mix, so.

647
00:51:49,834 --> 00:51:50,495
[SPEAKER_22]: They did, though.

648
00:51:50,675 --> 00:51:51,396
[SPEAKER_22]: They did at one point.

649
00:51:51,656 --> 00:51:52,817
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it's probably upgraded, though.

650
00:51:52,837 --> 00:51:55,039
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

651
00:51:55,179 --> 00:51:56,860
[SPEAKER_22]: I kind of want that Keyboard Mania machine.

652
00:51:57,080 --> 00:52:00,083
[SPEAKER_22]: I don't know why I'm so, like, into Keyboard Mania, but I am.

653
00:52:00,163 --> 00:52:01,064
[SPEAKER_22]: Like, I really want it.

654
00:52:01,164 --> 00:52:03,646
[SPEAKER_02]: If I had a house, I'd be getting something.

655
00:52:04,198 --> 00:52:04,658
[SPEAKER_22]: Thanks for watching!

656
00:52:28,897 --> 00:52:36,020
[SPEAKER_22]: Speaking of next year, it looks highly, highly probable I'm going to be at, now I haven't signed on the line and everything, but it's very, very probable.

657
00:52:36,060 --> 00:52:39,882
[SPEAKER_22]: And I know we have a lot of listeners on the East Coast who have asked me to hang out with them.

658
00:52:41,062 --> 00:52:41,923
[SPEAKER_22]: And I actually did.

659
00:52:42,003 --> 00:52:46,545
[SPEAKER_22]: When I went to Pennsylvania last time I was out there, I actually hung out with a couple of the listeners.

660
00:52:46,565 --> 00:52:46,885
[SPEAKER_22]: It was cool.

661
00:52:46,905 --> 00:52:47,385
[SPEAKER_22]: It was a good time.

662
00:52:48,025 --> 00:53:03,090
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm down for that again and the time and place to be at is Katsukan which is going to be in February I believe it's the 17th through 19th don't quote me on that but it's around there and in DC and it's looking very very likely I'm going to be there and possibly doing a panel which will be a lot of fun

663
00:53:03,410 --> 00:53:04,070
[SPEAKER_22]: That would be fun.

664
00:53:04,290 --> 00:53:07,752
[SPEAKER_22]: So I will let you know absolutely for sure the details as soon as I know.

665
00:53:08,653 --> 00:53:12,034
[SPEAKER_22]: And I've bought my plane tickets and everything, but it does look very likely I'm going to be there.

666
00:53:12,635 --> 00:53:13,675
[SPEAKER_22]: So I'm pretty excited.

667
00:53:13,915 --> 00:53:15,076
[SPEAKER_22]: I haven't been to D.C.

668
00:53:15,096 --> 00:53:15,596
[SPEAKER_22]: in a long time.

669
00:53:15,636 --> 00:53:18,198
[SPEAKER_22]: The only thing I'm kind of freaked out about is that in February it might be snowing.

670
00:53:19,198 --> 00:53:19,418
[SPEAKER_22]: Right?

671
00:53:19,898 --> 00:53:20,579
[SPEAKER_22]: Don't they get snow?

672
00:53:21,679 --> 00:53:23,941
[SPEAKER_22]: This is the California side of me.

673
00:53:24,721 --> 00:53:29,363
[SPEAKER_22]: Even though it does snow in some parts of California, I don't live in one of those parts, so I'm so ignorant when it comes to snow.

674
00:53:30,744 --> 00:53:31,064
[SPEAKER_22]: I don't know.

675
00:53:31,244 --> 00:53:32,025
[SPEAKER_02]: I've never been to D.C.,

676
00:53:32,958 --> 00:53:33,898
[SPEAKER_22]: I have before, it's fun.

677
00:53:36,279 --> 00:53:36,559
[SPEAKER_22]: Alright.

678
00:53:39,179 --> 00:53:39,799
[SPEAKER_22]: Uh, anyway.

679
00:53:39,819 --> 00:53:42,080
[SPEAKER_22]: Uh, moving on.

680
00:53:42,100 --> 00:53:44,480
[SPEAKER_22]: We were going to do Extroverse movie review, but the room cleared out.

681
00:53:45,700 --> 00:53:46,861
[SPEAKER_22]: Did somebody fart or something?

682
00:53:46,881 --> 00:53:48,241
[SPEAKER_22]: Because the room just cleared out.

683
00:53:48,481 --> 00:53:49,181
[SPEAKER_02]: His phone rang.

684
00:53:49,201 --> 00:53:50,981
[SPEAKER_22]: Miklatov ran out, Extroverse phone rang.

685
00:53:51,141 --> 00:53:54,822
[SPEAKER_22]: Miklatov's trying to pack his bags, because they're leaving soon, and DarkSakura had to go to the restroom, so.

686
00:53:56,142 --> 00:53:56,662
[SPEAKER_22]: Oh, gosh.

687
00:53:58,103 --> 00:53:58,343
[SPEAKER_22]: Anyway.

688
00:53:59,543 --> 00:53:59,643
[SPEAKER_22]: Um...

689
00:54:01,397 --> 00:54:03,699
[SPEAKER_22]: Let's see, what else, what else, what else?

690
00:54:05,701 --> 00:54:08,203
[SPEAKER_22]: I guess let's talk about the 360 for a little bit.

691
00:54:09,504 --> 00:54:13,027
[SPEAKER_22]: Some of the horror stories, did you hear about some of the horror stories when it came to the 360?

692
00:54:13,927 --> 00:54:20,093
[SPEAKER_22]: About like the Walmart that had the riot somewhere in Pennsylvania and there was EB games that got robbed?

693
00:54:20,113 --> 00:54:21,234
[SPEAKER_02]: I heard of some funny ones.

694
00:54:21,274 --> 00:54:21,494
[SPEAKER_22]: Uh-huh.

695
00:54:21,954 --> 00:54:28,241
[SPEAKER_02]: There was one where there was a big line out in front of this Walmart, I think it was, or Walmart Target, something like that.

696
00:54:29,443 --> 00:54:34,549
[SPEAKER_02]: So a big line of people and they had one cop sitting there making sure nothing's gone wrong.

697
00:54:34,569 --> 00:54:40,916
[SPEAKER_02]: Then this National Guardsman comes up and it's like, holy shit, he's getting everything in order.

698
00:54:42,253 --> 00:54:48,678
[SPEAKER_02]: immediately stands in the front of the line, gets a ticket to buy an Xbox 360, and is like, FIN FOR YOURSELVES, and leaves.

699
00:54:50,239 --> 00:54:50,820
[SPEAKER_02]: What?

700
00:54:51,240 --> 00:54:52,081
[SPEAKER_02]: That's crazy.

701
00:54:52,962 --> 00:54:54,543
[SPEAKER_02]: That's funny, is what that is.

702
00:54:55,484 --> 00:54:56,705
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd be pissed.

703
00:54:56,765 --> 00:54:58,326
[SPEAKER_22]: I want to let Extover do his thing.

704
00:54:58,346 --> 00:55:00,788
[SPEAKER_22]: We'll go back to the 360 in a little bit, but Extover's back in the room.

705
00:55:01,148 --> 00:55:02,890
[SPEAKER_22]: Do you have an important phone call you had to take?

706
00:55:03,510 --> 00:55:06,253
[SPEAKER_09]: I did have an important... Was it a hookup call?

707
00:55:06,273 --> 00:55:08,135
[SPEAKER_09]: It was definitely not a hookup call.

708
00:55:08,155 --> 00:55:08,595
[SPEAKER_09]: Booty call?

709
00:55:08,915 --> 00:55:09,116
[SPEAKER_09]: No.

710
00:55:09,336 --> 00:55:09,716
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, okay.

711
00:55:09,836 --> 00:55:10,497
[SPEAKER_09]: Was it a family call?

712
00:55:10,517 --> 00:55:11,037
[SPEAKER_09]: Is everything okay?

713
00:55:11,158 --> 00:55:12,199
[SPEAKER_09]: No, everything's fine.

714
00:55:12,479 --> 00:55:13,640
[SPEAKER_09]: You seem kind of bunned out tonight.

715
00:55:13,780 --> 00:55:14,541
[SPEAKER_09]: Is everything okay?

716
00:55:14,581 --> 00:55:15,642
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm just, like, tired.

717
00:55:15,722 --> 00:55:16,323
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you need a hug?

718
00:55:17,243 --> 00:55:17,944
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, no.

719
00:55:17,964 --> 00:55:18,885
[SPEAKER_09]: Don't touch me.

720
00:55:19,105 --> 00:55:19,606
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, I won't.

721
00:55:19,666 --> 00:55:20,026
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm kidding.

722
00:55:22,588 --> 00:55:24,189
[SPEAKER_09]: How was your week, Extover?

723
00:55:25,170 --> 00:55:27,092
[SPEAKER_09]: My week was fine.

724
00:55:27,212 --> 00:55:29,453
[SPEAKER_09]: It was like Thanksgiving and stuff.

725
00:55:30,194 --> 00:55:37,279
[SPEAKER_09]: Saw my family and went and saw Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire again.

726
00:55:37,359 --> 00:55:40,822
[SPEAKER_09]: Liked it a lot better than the first time that I saw it.

727
00:55:41,142 --> 00:55:42,323
[SPEAKER_08]: I need to go see that again.

728
00:55:43,149 --> 00:55:44,910
[SPEAKER_09]: Are you going to see that four times in the theater?

729
00:55:45,010 --> 00:55:45,931
[SPEAKER_22]: I can.

730
00:55:47,772 --> 00:55:51,795
[SPEAKER_22]: Oh, and it's the fourth movie, so you'll see it four times in the theater.

731
00:55:51,936 --> 00:55:52,256
[SPEAKER_22]: Get it?

732
00:55:53,337 --> 00:55:54,758
[SPEAKER_09]: That's really retarded.

733
00:55:54,798 --> 00:55:55,838
[SPEAKER_22]: Don't say that again.

734
00:55:56,419 --> 00:55:56,659
[SPEAKER_22]: All right.

735
00:55:56,959 --> 00:56:02,263
[SPEAKER_22]: Well, I know you've got to get going soon because you and Mickey have to get on the road, but I wanted to allow you a chance to do your movie review.

736
00:56:02,583 --> 00:56:05,365
[SPEAKER_22]: Now, I know you hate your old theme music, so I changed your theme music.

737
00:56:05,606 --> 00:56:05,846
[SPEAKER_22]: Okay?

738
00:56:05,906 --> 00:56:06,306
[SPEAKER_22]: Okay.

739
00:56:06,366 --> 00:56:06,606
[SPEAKER_22]: All right.

740
00:56:06,866 --> 00:56:08,488
[SPEAKER_22]: So what movie are you going to be reviewing today?

741
00:56:10,676 --> 00:56:13,038
[SPEAKER_09]: I am going to be... What is that?

742
00:56:13,898 --> 00:56:14,999
[SPEAKER_09]: Just do your talking.

743
00:56:15,039 --> 00:56:16,340
[SPEAKER_09]: Don't worry about what's going on behind you.

744
00:56:16,921 --> 00:56:22,125
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm going to be reviewing Rent because I went and saw it yesterday with all you folks.

745
00:56:23,466 --> 00:56:38,319
[SPEAKER_09]: And basically it's a movie about late 80s people trying to make it in New York and having problems financially and dying of AIDS.

746
00:56:39,639 --> 00:56:44,843
[SPEAKER_09]: Pretty much like you said yesterday, if you don't get a job, then you'll die of AIDS.

747
00:56:44,903 --> 00:56:48,785
[SPEAKER_22]: That was my summary of the moral I learned from Rant, is that if you don't get a job, you'll die of AIDS.

748
00:56:48,985 --> 00:56:49,225
[SPEAKER_22]: Right.

749
00:56:49,306 --> 00:56:50,987
[SPEAKER_22]: Rob didn't really like it that much.

750
00:56:51,067 --> 00:56:52,027
[SPEAKER_09]: I hated Rant.

751
00:56:52,107 --> 00:56:53,128
[SPEAKER_09]: I hated it a lot.

752
00:56:53,388 --> 00:56:54,009
[SPEAKER_09]: I liked it.

753
00:56:54,229 --> 00:56:55,189
[SPEAKER_09]: I liked it quite a bit.

754
00:56:55,569 --> 00:56:59,972
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think this may be because I really just am into musicals.

755
00:57:00,052 --> 00:57:00,613
[SPEAKER_09]: I love them.

756
00:57:01,873 --> 00:57:03,094
[SPEAKER_09]: I like the music in them.

757
00:57:03,555 --> 00:57:05,296
[SPEAKER_09]: It was poignant.

758
00:57:05,396 --> 00:57:07,397
[SPEAKER_09]: It had some really good moments in it.

759
00:57:07,517 --> 00:57:08,318
[SPEAKER_09]: Is that because you're gay?

760
00:57:08,758 --> 00:57:10,540
[SPEAKER_09]: No way, I'm gay and I didn't like it.

761
00:57:11,321 --> 00:57:15,104
[SPEAKER_09]: No, I don't think that liking musicals is a gay or straight thing.

762
00:57:15,865 --> 00:57:19,969
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, you can be a musical lover.

763
00:57:20,349 --> 00:57:22,011
[SPEAKER_09]: My mom's straight and she loves musicals.

764
00:57:22,251 --> 00:57:22,572
[SPEAKER_09]: Right.

765
00:57:23,913 --> 00:57:24,934
[SPEAKER_09]: Bad example, Rob.

766
00:57:25,254 --> 00:57:26,495
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

767
00:57:26,996 --> 00:57:27,937
[SPEAKER_08]: I like musicals.

768
00:57:28,410 --> 00:57:29,471
[SPEAKER_09]: They're very fun.

769
00:57:29,731 --> 00:57:31,232
[SPEAKER_09]: I like musicals, I just don't like red.

770
00:57:32,033 --> 00:57:34,775
[SPEAKER_09]: I know, as I heard many a time.

771
00:57:36,056 --> 00:57:37,196
[SPEAKER_09]: No, it was good though.

772
00:57:37,296 --> 00:57:37,857
[SPEAKER_09]: I liked it.

773
00:57:37,997 --> 00:57:38,918
[SPEAKER_09]: I really enjoyed it.

774
00:57:40,399 --> 00:57:41,880
[SPEAKER_09]: And there you go.

775
00:57:42,961 --> 00:57:43,801
[SPEAKER_09]: So two thumbs up?

776
00:57:44,221 --> 00:57:47,344
[SPEAKER_09]: Two cocks up and a limp cock.

777
00:57:48,244 --> 00:57:50,286
[SPEAKER_09]: Use protection, or you might catch something.

778
00:57:51,467 --> 00:57:52,547
[SPEAKER_09]: Right.

779
00:57:52,627 --> 00:57:54,309
[SPEAKER_09]: Or else your cocks will die of AIDS.

780
00:57:55,389 --> 00:57:57,251
[SPEAKER_09]: And make sure your cocks get a job.

781
00:57:58,422 --> 00:57:59,082
[SPEAKER_09]: Please get a job.

782
00:57:59,102 --> 00:58:00,083
[SPEAKER_09]: A blowjob.

783
00:58:00,603 --> 00:58:01,284
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, I'm off.

784
00:58:01,324 --> 00:58:02,845
[SPEAKER_09]: And careful not to sell out to the man.

785
00:58:03,705 --> 00:58:04,766
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, don't do that.

786
00:58:05,306 --> 00:58:07,107
[SPEAKER_09]: Don't sell out to the man.

787
00:58:07,347 --> 00:58:07,908
[SPEAKER_09]: Final thoughts?

788
00:58:09,329 --> 00:58:11,090
[SPEAKER_09]: Go see Rent.

789
00:58:11,770 --> 00:58:12,150
[SPEAKER_09]: No, don't.

790
00:58:12,210 --> 00:58:13,811
[SPEAKER_09]: You may like it or you may not.

791
00:58:15,212 --> 00:58:15,492
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

792
00:58:16,613 --> 00:58:22,396
[SPEAKER_22]: Get Miklatov back in here so he can say his goodbyes too because I know you guys are leaving soon.

793
00:58:22,917 --> 00:58:24,457
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, Miklatov.

794
00:58:25,198 --> 00:58:26,739
[SPEAKER_22]: Is he out there somewhere?

795
00:58:27,941 --> 00:58:28,802
[SPEAKER_22]: Live Radio Kids.

796
00:58:29,703 --> 00:58:31,504
[SPEAKER_22]: We're not in an actual studio, by the way.

797
00:58:31,544 --> 00:58:35,448
[SPEAKER_22]: This is the spare bedroom in the apartment that Extrovert and I live in.

798
00:58:36,749 --> 00:58:38,570
[SPEAKER_22]: It's quite a nifty apartment.

799
00:58:39,111 --> 00:58:41,153
[SPEAKER_22]: Alright, give that mic back to Loki.

800
00:58:41,233 --> 00:58:42,534
[SPEAKER_22]: Alright, back to the 360.

801
00:58:42,634 --> 00:58:43,254
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah.

802
00:58:44,215 --> 00:58:45,837
[SPEAKER_22]: What's the status on your 360 now?

803
00:58:45,897 --> 00:58:49,280
[SPEAKER_22]: You pre-ordered your 360 back in, remind me when this was, like June?

804
00:58:49,420 --> 00:58:49,660
[SPEAKER_02]: August.

805
00:58:49,940 --> 00:58:50,260
[SPEAKER_22]: August.

806
00:58:50,901 --> 00:58:51,702
[SPEAKER_22]: And still no dice.

807
00:58:53,142 --> 00:58:54,623
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm on the first page, halfway down.

808
00:58:55,604 --> 00:58:59,746
[SPEAKER_02]: They said, though, that I will probably get mine before Christmas.

809
00:59:00,186 --> 00:59:09,091
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm guessing, they're saying, someone said in the chatroom that 14 units are going to each store each week or whatever, so if that's the case, I'll probably get mine probably in two weeks.

810
00:59:09,151 --> 00:59:16,495
[SPEAKER_22]: Well, why would 14 go to the Ma and Pa shop and bumfuck, you know, North Dakota, but then 14 go to Best Buy?

811
00:59:16,515 --> 00:59:21,758
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, well that's... I don't think, no one knows until they get the stupid shipments in, so...

812
00:59:22,718 --> 00:59:25,260
[SPEAKER_22]: Do we know anything about future shipments of Xbox 360s?

813
00:59:25,280 --> 00:59:26,701
[SPEAKER_02]: Because that's what I think is interesting.

814
00:59:47,825 --> 00:59:48,305
[SPEAKER_02]: Big deal.

815
00:59:48,406 --> 00:59:51,448
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, they sold out so that their drive-up hype, they did that.

816
00:59:51,688 --> 00:59:54,871
[SPEAKER_02]: Why would you drive up hype if you're not going to replenish the market?

817
00:59:54,951 --> 00:59:55,852
[SPEAKER_02]: So it only makes sense.

818
00:59:56,232 --> 00:59:58,254
[SPEAKER_22]: You know, I have an interesting story to share real quick.

819
00:59:58,274 --> 01:00:04,519
[SPEAKER_22]: I know you've got to get going soon, so I want to give you a chance to say your final thought and any other things you want to say to the listeners.

820
01:00:04,892 --> 01:00:06,795
[SPEAKER_10]: Brokeback Mountain is the best thing ever.

821
01:00:06,815 --> 01:00:07,275
[SPEAKER_10]: Go buy it.

822
01:00:07,355 --> 01:00:08,136
[SPEAKER_10]: It's only like $10.

823
01:00:08,196 --> 01:00:09,138
[SPEAKER_10]: Go buy the soundtrack.

824
01:00:09,378 --> 01:00:10,399
[SPEAKER_10]: Go see the movie if you can.

825
01:00:19,764 --> 01:00:32,552
[SPEAKER_09]: If you like the notion of people buttfucking and spitting on their cocks and having that as a lubricant, then go see Bareback Mountain.

826
01:00:34,714 --> 01:00:39,637
[SPEAKER_22]: You know, this is like an Oscar caliber film they're trying to put this out as, and you're turning it into a porno.

827
01:00:41,596 --> 01:00:44,037
[SPEAKER_02]: I had a friend on Live Channel.

828
01:01:03,264 --> 01:01:06,847
[SPEAKER_22]: And I know this person doesn't listen to the show, so I'm okay to talk about this.

829
01:01:06,907 --> 01:01:09,408
[SPEAKER_22]: And it's behind a friend's lockpost anyway, so none of you would know who it is.

830
01:01:10,009 --> 01:01:11,890
[SPEAKER_22]: And I told him I don't know how I feel about this.

831
01:01:11,950 --> 01:01:14,392
[SPEAKER_22]: This is somebody, he's not a gamer in any capacity.

832
01:01:14,412 --> 01:01:16,073
[SPEAKER_22]: I mean, I think he's like a casual thing.

833
01:01:16,333 --> 01:01:20,336
[SPEAKER_22]: You know how most people our age have probably played Mario Brothers once in their life?

834
01:01:20,356 --> 01:01:21,056
[SPEAKER_22]: You know, that's about it.

835
01:01:21,417 --> 01:01:23,298
[SPEAKER_22]: But by no means a hardcore gamer.

836
01:01:23,898 --> 01:01:26,360
[SPEAKER_22]: He rounded up a team of individuals.

837
01:01:26,660 --> 01:01:28,502
[SPEAKER_22]: They got, I think, eight people or something.

838
01:01:28,602 --> 01:01:30,503
[SPEAKER_22]: And they managed to get nine people.

839
01:01:30,723 --> 01:01:35,324
[SPEAKER_22]: Platinum Xbox systems on launch day because they all camped out at least 24 hours in advance.

840
01:01:35,645 --> 01:01:37,985
[SPEAKER_22]: So they all got nine Platinum Xboxes.

841
01:01:39,446 --> 01:01:41,006
[SPEAKER_22]: They sold all the systems on eBay.

842
01:01:42,146 --> 01:01:48,308
[SPEAKER_22]: And they gave each person that stood out in line and helped them out $1,000 for their help.

843
01:01:48,468 --> 01:01:49,789
[SPEAKER_22]: And they were very happy for $1,000 for their help.

844
01:01:50,970 --> 01:02:02,923
[SPEAKER_22]: and they still had after that left over I think something like $8,000 that they put $5,000 away for the baby's education because they have a new baby on the way and the other $3,000 they just spent on themselves.

845
01:02:04,079 --> 01:02:29,783
[SPEAKER_22]: I don't know what I think about this because I think you're taking advantage of people but at the same time I blame the people that actually bid that much on eBay and allow you to think that this is a viable option for making money and I'm happy that as kids because they're going to invest the money and I know they will I know they will be smart with their money and invest the money and they will be able to send this baby to a

846
01:02:30,678 --> 01:02:33,860
[SPEAKER_22]: Really great school, all based on these Xbox 360 sales.

847
01:02:34,080 --> 01:02:36,421
[SPEAKER_22]: But as a gamer, I can't help but think, you bastard.

848
01:02:37,382 --> 01:02:38,202
[SPEAKER_22]: I wanted one of those.

849
01:02:38,882 --> 01:02:42,884
[SPEAKER_08]: They're taking advantage on the desperation and relative stupidity of other people.

850
01:02:43,245 --> 01:02:44,905
[SPEAKER_22]: But who's to blame in that scenario?

851
01:02:45,366 --> 01:02:45,766
[SPEAKER_22]: I don't know.

852
01:02:45,986 --> 01:02:47,187
[SPEAKER_22]: They were well within their rights.

853
01:02:48,327 --> 01:02:50,648
[SPEAKER_22]: I think, you know, it's hard for me to put the blame on them.

854
01:02:50,768 --> 01:02:51,889
[SPEAKER_22]: I think they are within their rights.

855
01:02:51,929 --> 01:02:52,969
[SPEAKER_08]: They are smart.

856
01:02:53,050 --> 01:02:54,210
[SPEAKER_08]: They put the work into it.

857
01:02:54,250 --> 01:02:57,772
[SPEAKER_08]: They put it online knowing that there were going to be morons out there who'd bid on them.

858
01:02:58,160 --> 01:02:59,020
[SPEAKER_22]: I know.

859
01:02:59,721 --> 01:03:00,081
[SPEAKER_22]: I don't know.

860
01:03:00,121 --> 01:03:03,402
[SPEAKER_22]: I believe the idiot masses should be exploited.

861
01:03:03,422 --> 01:03:07,104
[SPEAKER_22]: I just can't believe somebody would pay like $3,000.

862
01:03:07,604 --> 01:03:08,985
[SPEAKER_22]: And they got it.

863
01:03:09,025 --> 01:03:10,766
[SPEAKER_22]: They got like $3,100 for each of these systems.

864
01:03:10,826 --> 01:03:11,466
[SPEAKER_22]: It was crazy.

865
01:03:12,887 --> 01:03:13,407
[SPEAKER_22]: Crazy, crazy.

866
01:03:15,350 --> 01:03:15,950
[SPEAKER_02]: What can I say there?

867
01:03:16,070 --> 01:03:16,571
[SPEAKER_02]: People are dumb.

868
01:03:16,631 --> 01:03:18,732
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, like I said, I'm just waiting.

869
01:03:19,252 --> 01:03:37,761
[SPEAKER_02]: But if I do find one in a store, you know, if Best Buy is getting, you know, 90 in each shipment or whatever, and there's some sitting there, of course I'm going to buy one because, you know, I can have it now and I still have my, I can get my, you know, money back from my, you know, deposit on it and whatever.

870
01:03:37,821 --> 01:03:38,921
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's no big deal.

871
01:03:39,322 --> 01:03:43,844
[SPEAKER_02]: But, I mean, no, I'm really, when I look at the games and the four games that I got for it,

872
01:03:44,870 --> 01:03:47,812
[SPEAKER_02]: I looked at, once I got those four games, I still had like $70 in store credit.

873
01:03:47,852 --> 01:03:49,333
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, what do I buy now?

874
01:03:49,974 --> 01:03:52,156
[SPEAKER_02]: And I looked at the list of everything that's coming out.

875
01:03:52,176 --> 01:03:53,697
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, I don't want any of this.

876
01:03:54,317 --> 01:03:55,578
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's kind of what it is.

877
01:03:55,598 --> 01:04:02,263
[SPEAKER_22]: See, that's what's scaring me away from buying an Xbox 360 right now, is I really don't feel like... I think it's going to be the same thing with regular Xbox.

878
01:04:02,343 --> 01:04:05,586
[SPEAKER_22]: I had no reason to buy a regular Xbox until...

879
01:04:06,499 --> 01:04:12,061
[SPEAKER_22]: Halo, Willy, and even Halo, I wasn't a fan of Halo when I first played it, but I converted.

880
01:04:12,402 --> 01:04:13,702
[SPEAKER_22]: It's a first-person shooter I enjoy.

881
01:04:14,002 --> 01:04:15,523
[SPEAKER_08]: You need to see Perfect Dark Zero.

882
01:04:16,283 --> 01:04:17,424
[SPEAKER_22]: I do want to see Xbox 360.

883
01:04:17,704 --> 01:04:20,685
[SPEAKER_22]: It's all about Perfect Dark Zero.

884
01:04:20,745 --> 01:04:22,046
[SPEAKER_22]: Okay, well, I need to be talking to you.

885
01:04:22,146 --> 01:04:26,928
[SPEAKER_22]: As an Xbox 360 owner, which you and the hubby got one of these systems, right?

886
01:04:27,148 --> 01:04:27,228
[SPEAKER_22]: No.

887
01:04:27,268 --> 01:04:28,108
[SPEAKER_08]: I told you we didn't.

888
01:04:28,389 --> 01:04:30,450
[SPEAKER_22]: Oh, I thought... I told you we decided not to.

889
01:04:30,610 --> 01:04:32,030
[SPEAKER_22]: I know, but then I thought you went back and you did.

890
01:04:32,410 --> 01:04:33,591
[SPEAKER_08]: No, we went and played somebody else's.

891
01:04:34,271 --> 01:04:35,612
[SPEAKER_08]: And now we're going to get one next week.

892
01:04:36,273 --> 01:04:36,533
[SPEAKER_22]: Okay.

893
01:04:36,593 --> 01:04:38,514
[SPEAKER_08]: Because we are going to get one next week.

894
01:04:38,734 --> 01:04:39,195
[SPEAKER_22]: Gotcha.

895
01:04:39,295 --> 01:04:40,215
[SPEAKER_22]: Okay, now it makes sense.

896
01:04:40,315 --> 01:04:42,737
[SPEAKER_22]: Okay, so you didn't end up getting one, but you played somebody else's.

897
01:04:42,777 --> 01:04:43,357
[SPEAKER_22]: So what did you think?

898
01:04:43,517 --> 01:04:45,559
[SPEAKER_22]: I've only played the demo kiosk.

899
01:04:45,579 --> 01:04:46,619
[SPEAKER_22]: I haven't played an actual system yet.

900
01:04:46,639 --> 01:04:48,781
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a point where games can be too pretty.

901
01:04:49,682 --> 01:04:52,004
[SPEAKER_08]: and Project Gotham 3 is too pretty.

902
01:04:52,104 --> 01:04:53,926
[SPEAKER_08]: The cars look like they float over the ground.

903
01:04:54,607 --> 01:04:58,772
[SPEAKER_08]: However, you do actually start off with performance vehicles as opposed to just eye candy.

904
01:05:00,974 --> 01:05:05,259
[SPEAKER_08]: Like one of your first cars you can pick from is the Saleen Mustang or the...

905
01:05:08,658 --> 01:05:12,920
[SPEAKER_08]: New Shelby, which actually isn't even going to be out on the market to purchase until next year.

906
01:05:13,841 --> 01:05:17,203
[SPEAKER_22]: Now, did you play this on like a widescreen HD type setup?

907
01:05:17,223 --> 01:05:19,864
[SPEAKER_08]: I played it on an HD TV, but nowhere near as huge as mine.

908
01:05:20,144 --> 01:05:21,605
[SPEAKER_22]: But still, I bet it was very pretty.

909
01:05:22,085 --> 01:05:23,506
[SPEAKER_08]: It was pretty, but it was too pretty.

910
01:05:23,666 --> 01:05:26,048
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, like I said, the cursor, they were floating over the ground.

911
01:05:26,408 --> 01:05:27,929
[SPEAKER_08]: It does have good music in it, though.

912
01:05:28,709 --> 01:05:29,950
[SPEAKER_08]: Some really good original music.

913
01:05:31,151 --> 01:05:32,512
[SPEAKER_08]: Perfect Dark Zero was gorgeous.

914
01:05:32,933 --> 01:05:34,374
[SPEAKER_08]: The levels are humongous.

915
01:05:35,495 --> 01:05:38,337
[SPEAKER_08]: And there's lots of opportunity to shoot people.

916
01:05:38,537 --> 01:05:41,339
[SPEAKER_02]: Wait till you see Ghost Recon 3.

917
01:05:42,080 --> 01:05:42,680
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my god.

918
01:05:42,781 --> 01:05:44,162
[SPEAKER_08]: Actually, I wasn't too interested in it.

919
01:05:44,382 --> 01:05:44,862
[SPEAKER_08]: He had it.

920
01:05:45,082 --> 01:05:46,624
[SPEAKER_08]: It was boring.

921
01:05:46,764 --> 01:05:47,584
[SPEAKER_22]: What about Condemned?

922
01:05:47,604 --> 01:05:48,425
[SPEAKER_22]: Because I remember you liked it.

923
01:05:48,445 --> 01:05:49,426
[SPEAKER_22]: Did you get a chance to play Condemned yet?

924
01:05:49,446 --> 01:05:50,006
[SPEAKER_04]: It didn't have it.

925
01:05:50,347 --> 01:05:51,808
[SPEAKER_22]: Because I remember you liked that one at E3.

926
01:05:52,488 --> 01:05:53,349
[SPEAKER_22]: It didn't have it.

927
01:05:54,090 --> 01:05:55,971
[SPEAKER_22]: Maybe that was the Sega fangirl in you that liked it.

928
01:05:55,991 --> 01:05:56,292
[SPEAKER_22]: I don't know.

929
01:05:57,112 --> 01:06:23,708
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm looking forward to it I'm still going to get it I've got Waiting for Perfect Dark and I'm probably going to do maybe Condemned Ridge Racer if they send me a free copy But the other one we also there was another game they had there too No, it was the whatever that war game was Call of Duty Call of Duty, that was it Call of Duty was kind of boring

930
01:06:24,668 --> 01:06:26,329
[SPEAKER_22]: It was pretty, but it's kind of boring.

931
01:06:27,249 --> 01:06:32,052
[SPEAKER_22]: You know, the weird thing is that the two games I want most on the Xbox 360, I can get on another platform.

932
01:06:32,372 --> 01:06:33,172
[SPEAKER_22]: Quake 4 and Gun.

933
01:06:33,553 --> 01:06:39,896
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, Need for Speed Most Wanted, having compared the Xbox version and the 360... Actually, this is coming from Dan.

934
01:06:40,336 --> 01:06:47,499
[SPEAKER_08]: He compared the Xbox version, which he's been playing non-stop, and the 360 version, and said that actually the Xbox version plays better.

935
01:06:48,660 --> 01:06:52,342
[SPEAKER_08]: The 360 version is apparently a slower game.

936
01:06:53,896 --> 01:07:03,341
[SPEAKER_22]: I've already bought Soul Calibur 3 for PlayStation.

937
01:07:04,022 --> 01:07:05,643
[SPEAKER_22]: I have this bad feeling they're going to do it.

938
01:07:05,663 --> 01:07:06,843
[SPEAKER_22]: Why are you so sure they're not going to do it?

939
01:07:07,664 --> 01:07:08,084
[SPEAKER_22]: Why not?

940
01:07:08,164 --> 01:07:09,044
[SPEAKER_22]: Milk more money out of us.

941
01:07:09,505 --> 01:07:11,206
[SPEAKER_02]: No, they've said they're not going to.

942
01:07:11,566 --> 01:07:13,707
[SPEAKER_02]: That was a rumor that was going around about it, and they said no.

943
01:07:14,247 --> 01:07:14,667
[SPEAKER_02]: Why not?

944
01:07:15,308 --> 01:07:16,128
[SPEAKER_22]: That's stupid.

945
01:07:16,188 --> 01:07:16,849
[SPEAKER_22]: Why wouldn't they do it?

946
01:07:17,409 --> 01:07:19,590
[SPEAKER_02]: Because it's exclusive to Sony.

947
01:07:19,910 --> 01:07:20,751
[SPEAKER_22]: So was Resident Evil 4.

948
01:07:21,878 --> 01:07:24,313
[SPEAKER_02]: Sony paid for the rights to have it exclusive for...

949
01:07:24,790 --> 01:07:27,911
[SPEAKER_02]: And if that's the case, it might come out maybe next year or something like that.

950
01:07:27,971 --> 01:07:30,472
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, I didn't say it's going to come out tomorrow.

951
01:07:30,913 --> 01:07:42,397
[SPEAKER_22]: It would come out months after it's announced, but I bet you Soul Calibur 3 would end up getting released for the Xbox 360 outside of Sony's exclusive window, and it's going to have two new characters or something good that's going to make us all want to go buy it.

952
01:07:42,437 --> 01:07:46,139
[SPEAKER_22]: And I'm going to be pissed, because I already have it on PS2, but it's going to be prettier on Xbox 360.

953
01:07:46,179 --> 01:07:46,879
[SPEAKER_22]: Well, here's the thing.

954
01:07:46,999 --> 01:07:53,282
[SPEAKER_02]: Gun, I would recommend getting it on the current-gen systems, because the 360 is not worth the $10 extra you're paying for.

955
01:07:53,302 --> 01:07:54,322
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the same damn game.

956
01:07:54,962 --> 01:07:56,243
[SPEAKER_22]: No prettier graphics or anything?

957
01:07:56,804 --> 01:07:59,085
[SPEAKER_02]: The texture resolution is a little bit higher.

958
01:07:59,125 --> 01:08:01,267
[SPEAKER_02]: The character models have a few more polygons.

959
01:08:01,407 --> 01:08:01,747
[SPEAKER_02]: That's it.

960
01:08:02,108 --> 01:08:03,348
[SPEAKER_02]: Not like night and day.

961
01:08:03,529 --> 01:08:06,571
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not like, you know, Call of Duty 2 and Big Red 1.

962
01:08:06,651 --> 01:08:10,514
[SPEAKER_02]: There's major differences between those.

963
01:08:10,574 --> 01:08:17,118
[SPEAKER_02]: As far as Quake 4, I heard that there's problems with the frame rate in Quake 4 making it unplayable in parts because it's so slow on the 360.

964
01:08:17,158 --> 01:08:17,359
[SPEAKER_02]: Really?

965
01:08:19,720 --> 01:08:24,064
[SPEAKER_22]: Why didn't... These kind of mistakes kind of just ruffle my feathers.

966
01:08:24,244 --> 01:08:30,469
[SPEAKER_22]: I mean, and you hear about the Xboxes crashing and everything, and it's like, if it isn't completely fucking obvious that you rushed to get this out on the market.

967
01:08:30,489 --> 01:08:35,073
[SPEAKER_02]: 360, they said, I've read so many things about why it's crashing and overheating and stuff.

968
01:08:35,533 --> 01:08:39,036
[SPEAKER_02]: One of them, they said there's vent holes in them that some of them are getting punched out.

969
01:08:40,017 --> 01:08:41,418
[SPEAKER_08]: I didn't get to see the BSOD.

970
01:08:43,440 --> 01:08:44,101
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, the blue screen.

971
01:08:44,161 --> 01:08:44,921
[SPEAKER_08]: The black screen of death.

972
01:08:48,534 --> 01:08:52,918
[SPEAKER_02]: The power supply overheats and you have to put it on something that gets proper ventilation?

973
01:08:53,138 --> 01:08:53,939
[SPEAKER_08]: You have that problem.

974
01:08:54,559 --> 01:09:01,886
[SPEAKER_08]: They're overheating more commonly when they're kept inside of an entertainment cabinet.

975
01:09:02,026 --> 01:09:02,466
[SPEAKER_22]: Oh, I see.

976
01:09:02,486 --> 01:09:03,027
[SPEAKER_22]: I can see that.

977
01:09:03,928 --> 01:09:06,510
[SPEAKER_22]: Because I bet you in a testing environment they don't mimic that.

978
01:09:06,704 --> 01:09:09,086
[SPEAKER_02]: They're so big because they have a giant fan inside of them.

979
01:09:09,387 --> 01:09:10,047
[SPEAKER_02]: It's retarded.

980
01:09:10,548 --> 01:09:14,672
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, put this stupid thing on the system and forget about it.

981
01:09:15,092 --> 01:09:17,215
[SPEAKER_02]: The hard drive they said is overheating.

982
01:09:17,335 --> 01:09:19,137
[SPEAKER_02]: Just a lot of heat problems.

983
01:09:20,178 --> 01:09:23,481
[SPEAKER_02]: But then they're also saying, oh, it scratches disks and stuff.

984
01:09:24,062 --> 01:09:31,428
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, when you knock it over, like anything, if you're playing a CD and you knock the damn thing over, obviously it's going to scratch your stupid CD.

985
01:09:32,729 --> 01:09:36,552
[SPEAKER_02]: It's retarded, but that's one other thing that was going wrong with it.

986
01:09:36,572 --> 01:09:43,978
[SPEAKER_02]: Problems with the hard drive being able to read stuff, just problems like that.

987
01:09:44,259 --> 01:09:47,161
[SPEAKER_02]: It's widespread, and I haven't heard issues about live or anything.

988
01:09:47,777 --> 01:09:48,778
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

989
01:10:04,938 --> 01:10:10,640
[SPEAKER_08]: And one of our podcast listeners also stated that you can actually play your iPod in-game.

990
01:10:11,860 --> 01:10:12,801
[SPEAKER_22]: Oh, that's kind of cool.

991
01:10:13,241 --> 01:10:14,121
[SPEAKER_08]: Play music in-game.

992
01:10:14,821 --> 01:10:15,841
[SPEAKER_22]: And it comes out over your TV.

993
01:10:17,142 --> 01:10:17,342
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah.

994
01:10:17,622 --> 01:10:19,322
[SPEAKER_22]: That's kind of an interesting little perk.

995
01:10:19,342 --> 01:10:20,843
[SPEAKER_02]: You just can't rip stuff from...

996
01:10:21,696 --> 01:10:22,977
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for watching!

997
01:10:39,468 --> 01:10:39,708
[SPEAKER_22]: All right.

998
01:10:40,228 --> 01:10:42,049
[SPEAKER_22]: Well, so I don't know.

999
01:10:42,429 --> 01:10:47,371
[SPEAKER_22]: Me personally, Xbox 360, I think I'm going to end up waiting until next year to see some more games that are coming out.

1000
01:10:47,471 --> 01:10:49,372
[SPEAKER_22]: I was totally sold on getting one at launch.

1001
01:10:49,972 --> 01:10:53,654
[SPEAKER_22]: And had they been readily available everywhere, the impulse firing me probably would have done it.

1002
01:10:53,914 --> 01:10:54,114
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

1003
01:10:54,234 --> 01:10:56,034
[SPEAKER_22]: So I'm kind of glad they weren't available everywhere.

1004
01:10:56,475 --> 01:10:59,196
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm buying Gans for his birthday next week.

1005
01:10:59,416 --> 01:11:00,576
[SPEAKER_22]: That's a little different.

1006
01:11:00,596 --> 01:11:01,597
[SPEAKER_22]: Birthday, Christmas, you know.

1007
01:11:01,677 --> 01:11:02,557
[SPEAKER_22]: And my husband.

1008
01:11:02,797 --> 01:11:04,758
[SPEAKER_02]: I was staring down some of those core systems and stuff.

1009
01:11:04,818 --> 01:11:07,678
[SPEAKER_02]: And for example, there's another, there's websites out there where you can still get a 360.

1010
01:11:09,159 --> 01:11:18,141
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a guy that's getting in 90 next week and he's an online seller selling them for I think slightly over what retail is or something.

1011
01:11:18,621 --> 01:11:18,981
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

1012
01:11:19,202 --> 01:11:20,882
[SPEAKER_02]: But they're out there.

1013
01:11:21,622 --> 01:11:27,464
[SPEAKER_02]: Just wait until next week when the next shipment comes in and see how short they really are on these things.

1014
01:11:27,784 --> 01:11:31,145
[SPEAKER_02]: And I bet you anything that's going to be, you're going to see them in stores regularly.

1015
01:11:31,365 --> 01:11:31,665
[SPEAKER_02]: Because it's

1016
01:11:32,145 --> 01:11:32,666
[SPEAKER_02]: What's the point?

1017
01:11:32,786 --> 01:11:36,729
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I said before, driving the hype up if you're not going to replenish the supply.

1018
01:11:36,869 --> 01:11:37,910
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no point to it.

1019
01:11:39,011 --> 01:11:39,952
[SPEAKER_02]: And that was the whole point.

1020
01:11:39,992 --> 01:11:41,853
[SPEAKER_02]: They want to make it the must-have item for Christmas.

1021
01:11:43,024 --> 01:11:46,566
[SPEAKER_02]: If it's going to be the must-have item for Christmas, you've got to have some for Christmas.

1022
01:11:46,646 --> 01:11:49,047
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, I know.

1023
01:11:49,107 --> 01:11:56,170
[SPEAKER_22]: And of course, one of our chatters, Rainy, reminding us of the golden rule of gaming, a system is only as good as the games that are on it.

1024
01:11:56,670 --> 01:11:58,431
[SPEAKER_22]: And that fundamentally, I think, is a problem.

1025
01:11:58,571 --> 01:12:06,214
[SPEAKER_22]: Well, there are some good games for Xbox 360, but for me, my kind of games, the role-playing games and other type of games, there's just not enough.

1026
01:12:06,758 --> 01:12:14,083
[SPEAKER_02]: What I'm waiting to hear is I heard that the 360, some of the games may not be region coded.

1027
01:12:14,723 --> 01:12:18,486
[SPEAKER_02]: In which case, they're not sure if they're region coding everything or not.

1028
01:12:18,766 --> 01:12:22,709
[SPEAKER_02]: Because if they're not, then you can import like crazy.

1029
01:12:22,869 --> 01:12:23,950
[SPEAKER_22]: I heard that rumor as well.

1030
01:12:24,090 --> 01:12:26,772
[SPEAKER_22]: That would be, I gotta just do away with that region coding.

1031
01:12:26,932 --> 01:12:27,712
[SPEAKER_02]: PS3's doing it.

1032
01:12:28,233 --> 01:12:28,453
[SPEAKER_22]: Good.

1033
01:12:29,682 --> 01:12:33,083
[SPEAKER_22]: If I pay 70 bucks to import a Japanese game, then shit, I should just play it.

1034
01:12:33,103 --> 01:12:34,583
[SPEAKER_02]: ESP doesn't have region-coded games.

1035
01:12:35,523 --> 01:12:45,245
[SPEAKER_08]: It's about time they got rid of the... I mean, I always thought... I understood the reason behind it was to keep games per market and track them and all kinds of other stupid marketing crap.

1036
01:12:45,565 --> 01:12:49,186
[SPEAKER_22]: But thanks to the internet, we live in a worldwide market now, and I think people are coming to understand that.

1037
01:12:49,606 --> 01:12:51,227
[SPEAKER_22]: That's what I was going to say, actually.

1038
01:12:51,587 --> 01:12:51,827
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm sorry.

1039
01:12:53,727 --> 01:12:59,571
[SPEAKER_02]: What I'm thinking is, the only regions they should have are PAL and, you know, NTSC.

1040
01:12:59,671 --> 01:13:00,552
[SPEAKER_22]: Well, yeah, that makes sense.

1041
01:13:00,592 --> 01:13:02,233
[SPEAKER_08]: They should get rid of PAL altogether.

1042
01:13:02,533 --> 01:13:07,977
[SPEAKER_22]: But doesn't, isn't it, when we move into the HDTV age, isn't it all standardized?

1043
01:13:08,237 --> 01:13:08,837
[SPEAKER_22]: Or am I wrong?

1044
01:13:08,957 --> 01:13:11,499
[SPEAKER_22]: It's still, maybe some tech junkies in chat know.

1045
01:13:11,519 --> 01:13:16,582
[SPEAKER_08]: Technically, I've played PAL discs using my DVD player on my laptop, routed through my TV.

1046
01:13:17,223 --> 01:13:17,443
[SPEAKER_22]: Hmm.

1047
01:13:17,903 --> 01:13:18,644
[SPEAKER_08]: And it worked just fine.

1048
01:13:18,844 --> 01:13:19,004
[SPEAKER_22]: Hmm.

1049
01:13:20,342 --> 01:13:20,742
[SPEAKER_22]: Interesting.

1050
01:13:21,002 --> 01:13:27,426
[SPEAKER_22]: But I'm wondering in the HDTVs, with the new HDTVs, because it's a new resolution, like basically the issue between NTSC and PAL is resolution, right?

1051
01:13:27,826 --> 01:13:31,768
[SPEAKER_22]: So aren't HDTVs resolutions standardized throughout the world?

1052
01:13:32,028 --> 01:13:32,469
[SPEAKER_22]: Or am I wrong?

1053
01:13:32,709 --> 01:13:33,409
[SPEAKER_02]: I think they are.

1054
01:13:33,709 --> 01:13:34,330
[SPEAKER_22]: I do believe so.

1055
01:13:34,710 --> 01:13:35,170
[SPEAKER_22]: Then good.

1056
01:13:35,190 --> 01:13:36,571
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like using a computer monitor.

1057
01:13:37,071 --> 01:13:38,332
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, then good.

1058
01:13:38,352 --> 01:13:40,915
[SPEAKER_22]: Then we're moving towards a standardized there too.

1059
01:13:40,975 --> 01:13:52,628
[SPEAKER_22]: So, you know, and that would be good news for overseas people as well at some point because that's the reason why it takes them so damn long to get their games usually is because they have to redo all the resolution and stuff.

1060
01:13:52,688 --> 01:13:53,849
[SPEAKER_22]: So that's good news for them.

1061
01:13:53,909 --> 01:13:55,771
[SPEAKER_02]: Just do multiple languages from the start.

1062
01:13:55,951 --> 01:13:56,552
[SPEAKER_02]: Boom, done.

1063
01:13:56,832 --> 01:13:57,132
[SPEAKER_22]: I don't know.

1064
01:13:57,552 --> 01:13:58,053
[SPEAKER_22]: We'll see what happens.

1065
01:13:58,433 --> 01:13:59,554
[SPEAKER_22]: All right, we're going to do one more break.

1066
01:13:59,594 --> 01:14:00,754
[SPEAKER_22]: I know we said we'd do Skype Line.

1067
01:14:00,794 --> 01:14:02,055
[SPEAKER_22]: We will do that when we come back.

1068
01:14:02,075 --> 01:14:04,657
[SPEAKER_22]: We're also going to do the Cage Match and anything else we feel like.

1069
01:14:04,977 --> 01:14:10,980
[SPEAKER_22]: But I have to go potty, so that means, and Loki's going to beat me to it, I have to go potty, so that means we have to break.

1070
01:14:11,360 --> 01:14:12,381
[SPEAKER_22]: So we'll be back after this.

1071
01:14:12,701 --> 01:14:15,503
[SPEAKER_22]: In this break, we'll start it off with a little bit of Superstar.

1072
01:14:15,963 --> 01:14:17,444
[SPEAKER_22]: Remember this song, Dark Sakura?

1073
01:14:17,504 --> 01:14:18,344
[SPEAKER_22]: We used to love this song.

1074
01:14:18,545 --> 01:14:20,666
[SPEAKER_22]: I still do, but... It used to be my PA song.

1075
01:14:20,806 --> 01:14:22,007
[SPEAKER_22]: Dancing to this song was wonderful.

1076
01:14:22,167 --> 01:14:23,287
[SPEAKER_22]: It used to be my PA song.

1077
01:14:23,447 --> 01:14:23,888
[SPEAKER_22]: Good times.

1078
01:14:25,269 --> 01:14:28,313
[SPEAKER_22]: If we actually play DDR, it might still be your PNPA song.

1079
01:14:28,613 --> 01:14:28,954
[SPEAKER_22]: Maybe.

1080
01:14:29,655 --> 01:14:31,157
[SPEAKER_22]: We'll be back after this with more Orange Launch Radio.

1081
01:18:51,636 --> 01:18:53,717
Baby, if you want to come back

1082
01:19:49,068 --> 01:19:50,208
Thanks for watching!

1083
01:20:52,763 --> 01:21:02,851
[SPEAKER_16]: Hi-ho, Kermit the Frog here, informing you that today's broadcast of Orange Lounge Radio is brought to you by the letter V, the letter A, and the number 59.

1084
01:21:02,891 --> 01:21:08,256
[SPEAKER_07]: Can you tell me how to get, how to get to Saturday night?

1085
01:21:08,871 --> 01:21:12,254
[SPEAKER_22]: We're back here, boys and girls, on Orange Lounge Radio, and I hope you enjoyed that break.

1086
01:21:12,415 --> 01:21:14,677
[SPEAKER_22]: A little, just some potpourri music there.

1087
01:21:14,717 --> 01:21:18,240
[SPEAKER_22]: I tried to put in some stuff that I know Jamie likes that we haven't played in a while.

1088
01:21:18,481 --> 01:21:25,608
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm kind of doing stuff I think Jamie likes tonight because, you know, it's been a while since she's been here and getting to dictate the picks in my ear.

1089
01:21:26,489 --> 01:21:30,332
[SPEAKER_22]: But she hasn't really said a lot of songs she wants to hear tonight, so I'm playing stuff I think she'd want to hear.

1090
01:21:30,773 --> 01:21:31,333
[SPEAKER_22]: Am I doing good?

1091
01:21:32,114 --> 01:21:32,955
[SPEAKER_22]: So far so good.

1092
01:21:33,035 --> 01:21:33,655
[SPEAKER_22]: So far so good.

1093
01:21:33,715 --> 01:21:40,100
[SPEAKER_22]: In that break we heard Superstar, The Safari, because I know you love The Safari, Look to the Sky, I don't know how big you are on that song.

1094
01:21:40,120 --> 01:21:41,961
[SPEAKER_22]: That was more for the listeners, because I know that's a listener favorite.

1095
01:21:41,981 --> 01:21:42,561
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, screw them.

1096
01:21:42,701 --> 01:21:45,503
[SPEAKER_22]: And Era, Taku, which we had to do.

1097
01:21:45,783 --> 01:21:47,324
[SPEAKER_22]: We had to do at least one song by him.

1098
01:21:48,425 --> 01:21:50,447
[SPEAKER_22]: So maybe some more Jamie-inspired stuff next break.

1099
01:21:50,487 --> 01:21:57,293
[SPEAKER_22]: But for now, we're actually going to head on over to the Skype line, and if you would like to call us, please do so.

1100
01:21:58,154 --> 01:22:05,300
[SPEAKER_22]: Just head on over to www.orangeloungeradio.com and click on Interact With Us.

1101
01:22:06,121 --> 01:22:07,922
[SPEAKER_22]: Sorry, the program was being unruly there for a minute.

1102
01:22:07,962 --> 01:22:09,464
[SPEAKER_22]: I had to figure out what's going on.

1103
01:22:11,185 --> 01:22:11,526
[SPEAKER_22]: There we go.

1104
01:22:11,546 --> 01:22:14,228
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes, we're up and ready to go on Skype if you guys want to call in.

1105
01:22:14,668 --> 01:22:20,333
[SPEAKER_22]: Also, we have a... Oh, the Skype server might be down right now, actually, because it's still showing us it's connecting.

1106
01:22:20,413 --> 01:22:22,896
[SPEAKER_22]: So we're going to have to proceed.

1107
01:22:22,916 --> 01:22:25,158
[SPEAKER_22]: Okay, we're not going to take calls on Skype just yet.

1108
01:22:26,434 --> 01:22:28,876
[SPEAKER_22]: Live radio can't control when the servers go up and down, boys and girls.

1109
01:22:28,916 --> 01:22:33,138
[SPEAKER_22]: So let's actually head on over and see what else is going on in the Mimani world.

1110
01:22:33,778 --> 01:22:37,961
[SPEAKER_22]: I mentioned earlier in the show I checked out 2DX 10th Style this week.

1111
01:22:38,461 --> 01:22:40,062
[SPEAKER_22]: I don't know if either of you guys have gotten a chance to play it.

1112
01:22:40,342 --> 01:22:42,584
[SPEAKER_22]: Jamie, have you really picked up 9th or 10th?

1113
01:22:42,624 --> 01:22:43,224
[SPEAKER_22]: I thought you got 9th.

1114
01:22:43,304 --> 01:22:43,644
[SPEAKER_22]: No.

1115
01:22:44,625 --> 01:22:46,246
[SPEAKER_22]: No, you never got 9th or 10th?

1116
01:22:46,766 --> 01:22:48,327
[SPEAKER_22]: It's one of those things where it's kind of getting old.

1117
01:22:48,928 --> 01:22:49,408
[SPEAKER_08]: Kind of.

1118
01:22:50,888 --> 01:22:51,208
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

1119
01:22:51,468 --> 01:22:55,709
[SPEAKER_08]: I can keep in mind, I work full time and go to school part time.

1120
01:22:56,829 --> 01:23:01,950
[SPEAKER_08]: I really don't have a lot of time left over for BVMD until the end of the semester.

1121
01:23:02,150 --> 01:23:02,370
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.

1122
01:23:02,811 --> 01:23:05,231
[SPEAKER_08]: And I played a whole lot of 8th style over the summer.

1123
01:23:05,451 --> 01:23:05,691
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.

1124
01:23:06,311 --> 01:23:07,932
[SPEAKER_08]: Because I wasn't going to classes.

1125
01:23:08,552 --> 01:23:12,853
[SPEAKER_08]: But I figured that I was going to wait and pick up 10th style because I refused to play 9th style.

1126
01:23:13,573 --> 01:23:14,093
[SPEAKER_22]: Why 9th style?

1127
01:23:14,946 --> 01:23:16,810
[SPEAKER_08]: Just because of how crappy the arcade release was.

1128
01:23:16,850 --> 01:23:18,754
[SPEAKER_22]: Well, you know the timing's fine in the home version.

1129
01:23:18,914 --> 01:23:21,560
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not... Yeah, but it also didn't really have much in it I liked.

1130
01:23:22,455 --> 01:23:25,416
[SPEAKER_22]: You know what's funny is I have just the reverse with TenStyle.

1131
01:23:25,476 --> 01:23:42,478
[SPEAKER_22]: TenStyle is put together beautifully, and the song list is okay, and it's a really great looking game, especially because they've upped the resolution from the old third, fourth styles, and it's a very sharp looking game, and it's nice, but I find that when I was playing it, I was kind of like, where's all these songs I like from NinthStyle?

1132
01:23:43,039 --> 01:23:44,739
[SPEAKER_22]: See, I like NinthStyle an awful lot.

1133
01:23:45,599 --> 01:23:47,459
[SPEAKER_22]: I still think Eighth has the best of all of them.

1134
01:23:47,619 --> 01:23:51,000
[SPEAKER_22]: Eighth had a really solid song list, especially the arcade release, but...

1135
01:23:51,500 --> 01:24:04,845
[SPEAKER_22]: I don't know, I just, I do love 9th, so as soon as I get a new controller, because we're pretty confident that the US is getting their own controller that's going to be different, and hopefully better, that's when I'll truly get back into 2DX.

1136
01:24:04,905 --> 01:24:16,530
[SPEAKER_22]: But Miklosov was nice, he offered to let me borrow his 10th style and controller, because I'm supposed to be seeing him this weekend too, and he offered to let me borrow it all week so I could really test drive it, but I said, I'm going to be too busy with Dragon Quest VIII.

1137
01:24:17,350 --> 01:24:21,314
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, you know, my controller still works perfectly fine and it fell off the top of the van.

1138
01:24:22,415 --> 01:24:23,857
[SPEAKER_22]: I don't know how that is.

1139
01:24:24,137 --> 01:24:26,820
[SPEAKER_22]: I can't, I, I, you, you have the miracle controller.

1140
01:24:26,840 --> 01:24:28,482
[SPEAKER_08]: I've been through it three times.

1141
01:24:28,542 --> 01:24:29,783
[SPEAKER_22]: That's, that's still something else.

1142
01:24:30,964 --> 01:24:33,467
[SPEAKER_08]: I do have, my controller is indestructible.

1143
01:24:34,188 --> 01:24:34,508
[SPEAKER_22]: Well, what,

1144
01:24:37,529 --> 01:24:39,270
[SPEAKER_22]: I want to ask Loki about this real quick.

1145
01:24:39,290 --> 01:24:45,313
[SPEAKER_22]: These are some articles you posted on the site about the portable DDR and Beatmania sim games that are out there.

1146
01:24:45,353 --> 01:24:46,013
[SPEAKER_22]: What's going on with this?

1147
01:24:46,053 --> 01:24:49,435
[SPEAKER_22]: I know this isn't your sim scene update, but what's going on with these PSP clones?

1148
01:24:50,816 --> 01:24:56,058
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I mentioned last week about the old DDR one, and it's pretty cool.

1149
01:24:56,418 --> 01:25:01,060
[SPEAKER_02]: You get to actually... It's basically Steadmania for the PSP.

1150
01:25:01,621 --> 01:25:05,343
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, the Beatmania one, not quite so much.

1151
01:25:05,483 --> 01:25:05,703
[SPEAKER_02]: Like...

1152
01:25:07,179 --> 01:25:08,560
[SPEAKER_02]: Beatmania for the PSP.

1153
01:25:08,660 --> 01:25:14,303
[SPEAKER_02]: It's more of a two-button Beatmania because the way the buttons are mapped.

1154
01:25:14,723 --> 01:25:29,791
[SPEAKER_02]: But you could actually, I guess, remap everything so that you could play songs using their corresponding keys, but I mean, with a PSP, it's kind of hard to play seven-key Beatmania on it, obviously.

1155
01:25:30,951 --> 01:25:34,733
[SPEAKER_02]: I was actually installing that on my PSP right now as...

1156
01:25:35,994 --> 01:25:36,995
[SPEAKER_02]: as you caught me.

1157
01:25:37,355 --> 01:25:39,777
[SPEAKER_02]: But, no, it looks really good, actually.

1158
01:25:40,017 --> 01:25:45,041
[SPEAKER_02]: They've got quite a setup for DDR and stuff.

1159
01:25:45,061 --> 01:25:50,165
[SPEAKER_02]: This one looks like it's more of like, I don't know, Delight Delight reduplication or whatever.

1160
01:25:50,485 --> 01:25:53,908
[SPEAKER_02]: Because you can do DDR in the Beatmania setup as well.

1161
01:25:54,649 --> 01:25:59,212
[SPEAKER_02]: And they also have 2DX in normal Beatmania as well.

1162
01:25:59,352 --> 01:25:59,492
[SPEAKER_02]: So...

1163
01:26:00,356 --> 01:26:04,801
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not really sure how that works, but it looks pretty cool.

1164
01:26:05,782 --> 01:26:07,424
[SPEAKER_02]: And they've got really good skins for it.

1165
01:26:09,626 --> 01:26:16,974
[SPEAKER_02]: And both of them are available on PSP Updates right now, but I think we'll be adding them maybe to the PSP site at some point.

1166
01:26:18,216 --> 01:26:19,237
[SPEAKER_22]: Alright, sounds good.

1167
01:26:22,345 --> 01:26:24,027
[SPEAKER_22]: I know there was something else I was dying to mention.

1168
01:26:24,067 --> 01:26:24,588
[SPEAKER_22]: Oh, Strike!

1169
01:26:24,908 --> 01:26:29,073
[SPEAKER_22]: There's lots of updates on DDR Strike that was going on over on DDR Freak.

1170
01:26:29,133 --> 01:26:30,675
[SPEAKER_22]: Some folks had found some pictures.

1171
01:26:31,376 --> 01:26:37,163
[SPEAKER_22]: Damn it, and I wish I'd gotten to this when Mikulatov was here because maybe he could have elaborated a little bit even though I know he can't say a whole lot about work stuff.

1172
01:26:37,623 --> 01:26:39,344
[SPEAKER_22]: Thanks for watching!

1173
01:27:07,623 --> 01:27:09,705
[SPEAKER_22]: are crossovers from DDR Extreme 2.

1174
01:27:10,485 --> 01:27:14,989
[SPEAKER_22]: For instance, As the Rush Comes and Block Rockin' Beats, which we had in DDR Extreme 2.

1175
01:27:15,449 --> 01:27:26,358
[SPEAKER_22]: But here's the weird thing is that they have tied them to Dance Mania releases because As the Rush Comes was on Dance Mania EX7 and Block Rockin' Beats was on Dance Mania Winters.

1176
01:27:27,702 --> 01:27:30,748
[SPEAKER_22]: So I'm not sure, it's very interesting how this worked.

1177
01:27:30,808 --> 01:27:37,340
[SPEAKER_22]: I don't know if, were these games chosen for the US first, or were they actually chosen for Japan, and we got them anyway because they were easy to license.

1178
01:27:37,521 --> 01:27:37,901
[SPEAKER_22]: We don't know.

1179
01:27:39,144 --> 01:27:42,827
[SPEAKER_22]: But also apparently the scan in the magazine or whatever it is also gives away a couple other songs.

1180
01:27:43,107 --> 01:27:52,594
[SPEAKER_22]: Heaven is a Place on Earth, the German election mix from Dance Media Covers 01, and Let's Dance by David Bowie, which I think is a very sexy addition to DDR.

1181
01:27:52,634 --> 01:27:53,794
[SPEAKER_22]: I can't believe we're getting David Bowie.

1182
01:27:53,814 --> 01:27:54,455
[SPEAKER_22]: That is badass.

1183
01:27:54,815 --> 01:27:56,056
[SPEAKER_08]: David Bowie is so hot.

1184
01:27:56,176 --> 01:27:57,117
[SPEAKER_22]: And Let's Dance is a great song, too.

1185
01:27:57,137 --> 01:27:58,358
[SPEAKER_08]: He's going to be in a movie with Michael Caine.

1186
01:27:58,518 --> 01:27:59,619
[SPEAKER_22]: That's going to be great.

1187
01:28:00,119 --> 01:28:00,419
[SPEAKER_22]: Can't wait.

1188
01:28:01,180 --> 01:28:03,021
[SPEAKER_22]: And then You Sexy Thing by Hot Chocolate.

1189
01:28:03,041 --> 01:28:04,022
[SPEAKER_22]: And I can't think of what song...

1190
01:28:05,171 --> 01:28:11,694
[SPEAKER_22]: I can't think of what song the, uh, You Sexy Thing is, though, but I think that's that old song from, uh, um, You Sexy Thing.

1191
01:28:14,316 --> 01:28:15,877
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't think I remember hearing that song.

1192
01:28:15,897 --> 01:28:16,717
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you know who did it?

1193
01:28:17,658 --> 01:28:22,140
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, I remember, like, the line on it, but I don't remember how the song goes.

1194
01:28:22,580 --> 01:28:25,762
[SPEAKER_08]: It just must be because I have completely different tastes than that.

1195
01:28:25,822 --> 01:28:26,602
[SPEAKER_08]: I have no idea.

1196
01:28:27,063 --> 01:28:33,626
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it's good to see that this game isn't just going to be a rehash of DDR Extreme 2 like I was thinking it was going to be, but, uh,

1197
01:28:34,212 --> 01:28:34,772
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

1198
01:28:34,792 --> 01:28:35,673
[SPEAKER_02]: New stuff's always good.

1199
01:28:36,253 --> 01:28:40,076
[SPEAKER_22]: Well, I think what's also interesting is that there's some crossovers from Ultramix 2.

1200
01:28:40,336 --> 01:28:43,738
[SPEAKER_22]: At least one, which we can kind of infer because there's going to be one.

1201
01:28:43,778 --> 01:28:44,879
[SPEAKER_22]: There will be more than one.

1202
01:28:45,479 --> 01:28:51,563
[SPEAKER_22]: Baile La Samba, which was a Konami original for Ultramix 2, is crossing over.

1203
01:28:51,583 --> 01:28:54,084
[SPEAKER_22]: And that was picked off from one of the Mission Mode screens.

1204
01:28:54,104 --> 01:28:58,027
[SPEAKER_22]: A very observant person on DDR Freak noticed that the banners match up.

1205
01:28:58,367 --> 01:29:00,508
[SPEAKER_22]: So Baile La Samba is going to be there as well.

1206
01:29:00,548 --> 01:29:02,469
[SPEAKER_22]: So that is starting speculation as to...

1207
01:29:03,670 --> 01:29:06,492
[SPEAKER_22]: Might we see some of the freebie songs?

1208
01:29:06,572 --> 01:29:10,394
[SPEAKER_22]: Because as you know, a different drum sort of gave songs to Konami.

1209
01:29:10,754 --> 01:29:13,115
[SPEAKER_22]: Not really had them licensed, but gave them for the exposure.

1210
01:29:13,135 --> 01:29:15,797
[SPEAKER_22]: And that's where we got Skulk and Superstar.

1211
01:29:16,037 --> 01:29:20,239
[SPEAKER_22]: So it would be very, very interesting if some of these songs showed up in the Japanese mix.

1212
01:29:20,339 --> 01:29:21,560
[SPEAKER_22]: I think that would be kind of cool for them.

1213
01:29:21,620 --> 01:29:22,881
[SPEAKER_16]: That would be.

1214
01:29:23,021 --> 01:29:29,044
[SPEAKER_22]: I think for sure they will get Gyruss and probably the Midi Head mix and some of the other stuff.

1215
01:29:29,064 --> 01:29:30,565
[SPEAKER_22]: They'll probably get all that crap for sure.

1216
01:29:30,585 --> 01:29:32,246
[SPEAKER_22]: I don't see how they couldn't get that stuff.

1217
01:29:32,591 --> 01:29:40,794
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, also, when you think about it, was it Festival had Ultramix One stuff in it, so it only makes sense that they would do that.

1218
01:29:40,934 --> 01:29:46,137
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, I think a lot of people, this really isn't surprising anyone, but it's kind of cool, nonetheless.

1219
01:29:49,958 --> 01:29:51,339
[SPEAKER_22]: And what else we got going on with Strike?

1220
01:29:51,439 --> 01:30:04,703
[SPEAKER_22]: Then this came up later in the thread is that somebody actually got a screenshot and knew enough Japanese to kind of translate the little tiny stuff that shows up there on the side and notices that there is no online mode for the Japanese DDR Strike release.

1221
01:30:06,884 --> 01:30:07,644
[SPEAKER_22]: Interesting.

1222
01:30:07,704 --> 01:30:10,745
[SPEAKER_22]: I don't know if that's because DDR they don't think is popular over there.

1223
01:30:10,805 --> 01:30:11,206
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm not sure.

1224
01:30:11,246 --> 01:30:13,726
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm not sure what to think of this, why they're not doing the online mode.

1225
01:30:13,746 --> 01:30:15,127
[SPEAKER_22]: Or maybe it's just an early screenshot.

1226
01:30:15,147 --> 01:30:15,487
[SPEAKER_22]: Who knows?

1227
01:30:15,587 --> 01:30:17,808
[SPEAKER_02]: Or maybe because the Extreme 2 online sucked?

1228
01:30:20,177 --> 01:30:20,758
[SPEAKER_22]: That's true, too.

1229
01:30:20,778 --> 01:30:22,279
[SPEAKER_22]: Doesn't it have bugs, too?

1230
01:30:22,319 --> 01:30:23,820
[SPEAKER_22]: Aren't people still cheating on there and stuff?

1231
01:30:24,541 --> 01:30:25,702
[SPEAKER_02]: It sucked, apparently.

1232
01:30:26,462 --> 01:30:28,124
[SPEAKER_22]: Compared to the Xbox One, it does suck.

1233
01:30:28,164 --> 01:30:42,396
[SPEAKER_22]: It's too bad that Extreme 2 came out later, but I realize there's a lot of anti-Microsoft people, for lack of a better term, people that don't have Xboxes for financial, just don't want to, whatever reasons, that haven't gotten to experience the Xbox Live.

1234
01:30:42,416 --> 01:30:43,277
[SPEAKER_22]: And I'll tell you what, guys.

1235
01:30:44,159 --> 01:30:49,343
[SPEAKER_22]: I used to be anti-Microsoft too, and in some circumstances I still am to some extent.

1236
01:30:49,583 --> 01:31:00,891
[SPEAKER_22]: I don't like some of the things they do, but I've come to accept, embrace some of the things that are really great about Xbox, one of them being they have advanced videos, or the other one being that they

1237
01:31:01,391 --> 01:31:05,053
[SPEAKER_22]: have the best online system that kicks PS2's butt.

1238
01:31:05,393 --> 01:31:10,355
[SPEAKER_22]: I mean, Xbox Live kicks anything else's butt, basically, right now that's out there in the console world.

1239
01:31:10,735 --> 01:31:16,818
[SPEAKER_22]: And so, to go and play DDR on the Xbox Live, and then go to play it on Extreme 2, you're like, yeah, this sucks.

1240
01:31:17,339 --> 01:31:24,342
[SPEAKER_22]: But I bet for people that have never played Xbox Live, they probably don't know that it can be a lot better, so it works out just fine for them.

1241
01:31:24,802 --> 01:31:26,143
[SPEAKER_22]: So, I don't know.

1242
01:31:26,183 --> 01:31:27,543
[SPEAKER_22]: Still kind of interesting that they left it out.

1243
01:31:28,604 --> 01:31:28,944
[SPEAKER_22]: Who knows?

1244
01:31:31,164 --> 01:31:33,008
[SPEAKER_22]: Of course, more to come still on this game.

1245
01:31:33,048 --> 01:31:34,551
[SPEAKER_22]: We will see what happens a little later.

1246
01:31:34,591 --> 01:31:36,575
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm sure there are surprises still left in store.

1247
01:31:37,417 --> 01:31:37,738
[SPEAKER_22]: Who knows?

1248
01:31:39,764 --> 01:31:41,085
[SPEAKER_22]: Skype is doing some weird stuff with me, guys.

1249
01:31:41,105 --> 01:31:46,470
[SPEAKER_22]: That's going to be too bad if we have to do a show without Skype, because I'd love to hear from our listeners.

1250
01:31:46,510 --> 01:31:48,151
[SPEAKER_22]: We'd love to hear what they have to say.

1251
01:32:03,496 --> 01:32:04,577
[SPEAKER_22]: Let's try this one more time here.

1252
01:32:04,597 --> 01:32:05,657
[SPEAKER_22]: We're going to try connecting there.

1253
01:32:06,418 --> 01:32:08,539
[SPEAKER_22]: And yeah, I got booted again.

1254
01:32:09,099 --> 01:32:09,559
[SPEAKER_22]: That's great.

1255
01:32:10,020 --> 01:32:15,363
[SPEAKER_22]: Okay, so we're going to go ahead and actually we're going to go into the cage match for right now and try to get some time for Skype to come back up.

1256
01:32:15,723 --> 01:32:17,604
[SPEAKER_22]: And we'll go to the Skype line a little later in the show.

1257
01:32:18,004 --> 01:32:19,465
[SPEAKER_22]: And I'm sorry guys, I don't know what's happening there.

1258
01:32:19,485 --> 01:32:20,826
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm having timeout problems.

1259
01:32:20,886 --> 01:32:22,127
[SPEAKER_22]: Some of you might be on it.

1260
01:32:22,747 --> 01:32:24,308
[SPEAKER_22]: We're just having some problems here in studio.

1261
01:32:24,348 --> 01:32:27,430
[SPEAKER_22]: So I'm going to try some other things here while we go into the cage match.

1262
01:32:27,510 --> 01:32:31,632
[SPEAKER_22]: But it is time to get into this week's cage match.

1263
01:32:34,403 --> 01:32:38,445
[SPEAKER_22]: Now the nice thing about CageMatch is that we don't need our Skype line for CageMatch, we only need the chatroom.

1264
01:32:38,786 --> 01:32:44,629
[SPEAKER_22]: So you gotta be in our chatroom if you want to vote in CageMatch, and that's www.orangeloundtrader.com and click on chat.

1265
01:32:45,509 --> 01:32:51,893
[SPEAKER_22]: And the way CageMatch works is that we're going to play three songs for you guys, and your favorite song will go into rotation all week long.

1266
01:32:52,373 --> 01:32:55,634
[SPEAKER_22]: on Orange Lounge Radio's Bomani and Video Game Music program.

1267
01:32:56,075 --> 01:32:57,395
[SPEAKER_22]: And we had a winning song last week.

1268
01:32:57,435 --> 01:32:59,796
[SPEAKER_22]: It was a brand new winner, and it was something that Loki picked.

1269
01:33:00,436 --> 01:33:03,837
[SPEAKER_22]: And the song was by John Sykes, and it was called Cautionary Warning.

1270
01:33:04,698 --> 01:33:06,598
[SPEAKER_22]: And anything else you want to say about this song, Loki?

1271
01:33:07,739 --> 01:33:08,239
[SPEAKER_22]: Your mic's off.

1272
01:33:08,779 --> 01:33:09,700
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just a really cool song.

1273
01:33:09,960 --> 01:33:10,180
[SPEAKER_22]: Okay.

1274
01:33:10,680 --> 01:33:11,060
[SPEAKER_22]: Here it is.

1275
01:33:11,180 --> 01:33:14,201
[SPEAKER_22]: A clip of last week's winner, John Sykes, with Cautionary Warning.

1276
01:33:14,942 --> 01:33:15,582
[SPEAKER_22]: And here's a clip.

1277
01:33:24,257 --> 01:33:24,948
Thanks for watching!

1278
01:34:16,181 --> 01:34:18,063
Thank you for watching, and I'll see you next time.

1279
01:35:11,457 --> 01:35:16,944
[SPEAKER_22]: Alright, that was song number one in tonight's cage match, a clip of last week's winner, John Sykes, Cautionary Warning.

1280
01:35:17,284 --> 01:35:22,150
[SPEAKER_22]: Wasn't that, now I'm remembering that song, that's the one where the White Snake guitarist or something has something to do with that, right?

1281
01:35:22,590 --> 01:35:22,811
[SPEAKER_22]: Loki?

1282
01:35:25,622 --> 01:35:26,342
[SPEAKER_22]: That's very correct.

1283
01:35:26,362 --> 01:35:26,722
[SPEAKER_22]: Alright.

1284
01:35:27,223 --> 01:35:27,583
[SPEAKER_22]: Interesting.

1285
01:35:27,603 --> 01:35:27,963
[SPEAKER_22]: Alright.

1286
01:35:28,484 --> 01:35:30,285
[SPEAKER_22]: Song number two in tonight's K-Twitch will be my pick.

1287
01:35:30,305 --> 01:35:31,346
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm going to go ahead and go.

1288
01:35:32,186 --> 01:35:35,929
[SPEAKER_22]: My song is... Too bad Miklatel's not here because he talked this song up for me.

1289
01:35:36,309 --> 01:35:38,090
[SPEAKER_22]: But my song is by an artist named Andy Bell.

1290
01:35:38,451 --> 01:35:39,992
[SPEAKER_22]: And Andy Bell was half of Razor.

1291
01:35:40,492 --> 01:35:43,134
[SPEAKER_22]: You know, the great 80s and 90s synth-pop band.

1292
01:35:43,194 --> 01:35:43,894
[SPEAKER_22]: I love synth-pop.

1293
01:35:44,335 --> 01:35:46,396
[SPEAKER_22]: And Andy Bell has a solo album out now.

1294
01:35:47,037 --> 01:35:48,017
[SPEAKER_22]: And it's pretty cool.

1295
01:35:48,117 --> 01:35:51,380
[SPEAKER_22]: I like... I had to put in...

1296
01:35:54,699 --> 01:35:55,601
[SPEAKER_22]: Fuckin' mic, I hit this mic.

1297
01:35:55,841 --> 01:35:57,243
[SPEAKER_22]: You know I love me some synth pop.

1298
01:35:57,944 --> 01:36:03,033
[SPEAKER_22]: So I had to put this in because Andy Bell is one of the granddaddies of synth pop going back to Yaz and all these other great bands.

1299
01:36:03,373 --> 01:36:04,154
[SPEAKER_22]: I love this song.

1300
01:36:04,194 --> 01:36:05,577
[SPEAKER_22]: It's the latest CD, Electric Blue.

1301
01:36:05,617 --> 01:36:06,999
[SPEAKER_22]: It's song number two in tonight's cage match.

1302
01:36:07,319 --> 01:36:08,702
[SPEAKER_22]: Crazy, here on Orange Lounge Radio.

1303
01:40:04,451 --> 01:40:06,193
[SPEAKER_22]: Okay, that was song number two in tonight's Cage Mesh.

1304
01:40:06,233 --> 01:40:07,834
[SPEAKER_22]: It was Andy Bell with Crazy.

1305
01:40:08,174 --> 01:40:10,296
[SPEAKER_22]: And we'll go around and see what folks thought of that.

1306
01:40:10,396 --> 01:40:12,738
[SPEAKER_22]: If they were crazy for that song or it drove them crazy.

1307
01:40:13,199 --> 01:40:14,260
[SPEAKER_22]: DarkSakura, you're up first.

1308
01:40:16,061 --> 01:40:20,485
[SPEAKER_08]: It was... no offense, it was a little repetitive.

1309
01:40:20,585 --> 01:40:21,126
[SPEAKER_08]: I didn't write it.

1310
01:40:21,646 --> 01:40:22,066
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, no.

1311
01:40:22,427 --> 01:40:23,448
[SPEAKER_08]: It was okay.

1312
01:40:23,508 --> 01:40:24,509
[SPEAKER_08]: It wasn't a bad song.

1313
01:40:25,069 --> 01:40:28,532
[SPEAKER_08]: But I just find it a little repetitive and kind of boring, so it gets a 6.5.

1314
01:40:30,874 --> 01:40:32,255
[SPEAKER_22]: I've been blasting this song in my car all week.

1315
01:40:32,315 --> 01:40:32,955
[SPEAKER_22]: I really like it.

1316
01:40:33,355 --> 01:40:33,475
[SPEAKER_22]: Uh, 9.

1317
01:40:34,176 --> 01:40:34,496
[SPEAKER_22]: Loki.

1318
01:40:34,656 --> 01:40:36,417
[SPEAKER_22]: That's so crazy.

1319
01:40:37,037 --> 01:40:37,637
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll hold 7.5.

1320
01:40:37,737 --> 01:40:39,879
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay.

1321
01:40:40,379 --> 01:40:43,400
[SPEAKER_16]: Alright, moving on to song number 3 in tonight's Gage Match.

1322
01:40:43,480 --> 01:40:45,281
[SPEAKER_16]: DarkSakura, what'd you pick for us?

1323
01:40:46,022 --> 01:40:54,206
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, because it's that Saturday, which is usually the day I think about what I'm gonna play, um, I just picked the Blur song, so it's a crazy beat.

1324
01:40:55,468 --> 01:40:57,274
[SPEAKER_21]: Alright, sound of the pre-tonight's cage match.

1325
01:40:57,475 --> 01:40:57,796
[SPEAKER_21]: Blur!

1326
01:40:59,060 --> 01:40:59,722
[SPEAKER_21]: Blur!

1327
01:40:59,903 --> 01:41:00,706
[SPEAKER_21]: With Crazy Beat.

1328
01:41:00,886 --> 01:41:01,107
[SPEAKER_21]: Enjoy.

1329
01:41:54,122 --> 01:41:57,545
I love my brothers on Saturday night

1330
01:42:35,109 --> 01:42:48,279
[SPEAKER_07]: I love my sister and I love her tonight Break out!

1331
01:43:13,937 --> 01:43:17,080
I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know

1332
01:43:59,553 --> 01:44:01,456
Thank you for watching!

1333
01:44:17,938 --> 01:44:20,500
[SPEAKER_22]: Okay, that was song number three in tonight's cage match.

1334
01:44:20,560 --> 01:44:22,802
[SPEAKER_22]: That was Blur with Crazy Beat.

1335
01:44:23,303 --> 01:44:26,465
[SPEAKER_22]: Once again, are you crazy about that song or did it drive you crazy?

1336
01:44:26,505 --> 01:44:27,366
[SPEAKER_22]: DarkSakura.

1337
01:44:27,526 --> 01:44:30,149
[SPEAKER_08]: It's actually not my favorite Blur song, but I like it.

1338
01:44:30,949 --> 01:44:35,453
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, so, uh, give it an 8.5.

1339
01:44:37,335 --> 01:44:38,536
[SPEAKER_22]: Kicks and Butts Kicks and Butts

1340
01:45:16,991 --> 01:45:17,371
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

1341
01:45:17,391 --> 01:45:18,271
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

1342
01:45:18,331 --> 01:45:20,532
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you listening to tonight's K-Town songs, Loki?

1343
01:45:20,552 --> 01:45:22,352
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, I am listening to K-Town.

1344
01:45:22,712 --> 01:45:25,053
[SPEAKER_02]: I just thought it would be funny since both songs have crazy.

1345
01:45:25,073 --> 01:45:26,333
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, I know.

1346
01:45:26,413 --> 01:45:28,894
[SPEAKER_22]: It was interesting that both songs have crazy in the title.

1347
01:45:28,914 --> 01:45:30,394
[SPEAKER_22]: Just one of those funky coincidences.

1348
01:45:30,874 --> 01:45:33,955
[SPEAKER_22]: Well, alright, it's time for you guys to vote as soon as we recap.

1349
01:45:33,995 --> 01:45:40,116
[SPEAKER_22]: Here we go, the three songs you can vote for tonight, starting off with song number one, which is Cautionary Warning.

1350
01:45:48,647 --> 01:46:02,567
[SPEAKER_22]: And song number two you can vote for tonight is Andy Bell with Crazy And song number three you can vote for tonight is Blur with Crazy Beat

1351
01:46:10,918 --> 01:46:12,359
[SPEAKER_22]: All right, kids, you know what to do.

1352
01:46:12,399 --> 01:46:14,020
[SPEAKER_22]: Place vote now.

1353
01:46:14,100 --> 01:46:21,204
[SPEAKER_22]: Send a private message to Sky in the chat room with your vote, and we will reveal the wiener of the vote as soon as we can.

1354
01:46:21,985 --> 01:46:29,750
[SPEAKER_22]: Moving on over to Loki to talk about what else is going on in the sim scene besides the PSP thing, which, by the way, you actually showed me because you downloaded it there during the last little bit.

1355
01:46:29,850 --> 01:46:30,350
[SPEAKER_22]: It's pretty cool.

1356
01:46:30,390 --> 01:46:31,551
[SPEAKER_22]: That actually looks kind of neat.

1357
01:46:31,951 --> 01:46:36,474
[SPEAKER_22]: The skin's a little fucked because your life bar's in the middle of the screen, but, well, there's four skins.

1358
01:46:36,534 --> 01:46:38,615
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't tried the other four skins.

1359
01:46:40,067 --> 01:46:41,923
[SPEAKER_02]: I walked right into that joke, okay.

1360
01:46:43,104 --> 01:46:45,485
[SPEAKER_02]: No, there's supposedly four different skins for it.

1361
01:46:46,426 --> 01:46:50,867
[SPEAKER_02]: It's weird, though, because you can do DDR and stuff, but I haven't actually tried some of the other skins.

1362
01:46:51,848 --> 01:46:53,709
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been basically using a default one.

1363
01:46:53,969 --> 01:46:56,830
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't really know it's the life bar in the middle, so it's not a big problem for me.

1364
01:46:57,731 --> 01:47:03,833
[SPEAKER_02]: The keys, though, are a little fucked up, but I probably should have not been trying to play one key P1807.

1365
01:47:05,534 --> 01:47:07,075
[SPEAKER_02]: That just didn't work very well.

1366
01:47:07,595 --> 01:47:09,436
[SPEAKER_22]: You had one key assigned to all your buttons?

1367
01:47:09,476 --> 01:47:10,056
[SPEAKER_22]: What was that about?

1368
01:47:10,556 --> 01:47:12,478
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that's the default settings they have.

1369
01:47:12,498 --> 01:47:14,939
[SPEAKER_02]: Because try doing 7-key on a PSP.

1370
01:47:15,700 --> 01:47:17,901
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, then why point the damn thing to a PSP?

1371
01:47:18,662 --> 01:47:19,202
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

1372
01:47:19,643 --> 01:47:21,444
[SPEAKER_02]: But 5-key, though, works pretty well.

1373
01:47:21,804 --> 01:47:25,127
[SPEAKER_02]: So I am getting some nice 5-key sim files to try on it.

1374
01:47:26,107 --> 01:47:28,089
[SPEAKER_02]: Because, I don't know, it could work for that.

1375
01:47:29,960 --> 01:47:33,065
[SPEAKER_02]: Other than that, there is some stuff going on.

1376
01:47:33,165 --> 01:47:43,340
[SPEAKER_02]: I know on BomaniStyle right now they are actually doing OSC4, which is another SimFile contest, not to be confused with...

1377
01:47:44,421 --> 01:47:46,001
[SPEAKER_02]: Turny Mix, which is not going on anymore.

1378
01:47:46,662 --> 01:47:50,682
[SPEAKER_02]: But, anyways, OSC 4, I believe, is available for download right now.

1379
01:47:51,403 --> 01:47:52,223
[SPEAKER_02]: You can check it out.

1380
01:47:52,763 --> 01:48:02,225
[SPEAKER_02]: They've got some links on their front page there, and they also kind of talk about who's judging and how it's going to go and that type of stuff.

1381
01:48:02,725 --> 01:48:04,105
[SPEAKER_02]: So, check it out now.

1382
01:48:04,245 --> 01:48:07,906
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the keyboard division, so these are all going to be the ones that are impossible to play, so...

1383
01:48:09,878 --> 01:48:10,438
[SPEAKER_02]: Check those out.

1384
01:48:10,538 --> 01:48:11,899
[SPEAKER_22]: Not you, we're laughing in the chat room.

1385
01:48:12,419 --> 01:48:14,540
[SPEAKER_22]: No, that's alright.

1386
01:48:14,660 --> 01:48:20,782
[SPEAKER_22]: Somebody just joined and we said that they missed the cage match and their response was, and I quote, shit, shit, shitty, shit, shit.

1387
01:48:23,143 --> 01:48:24,524
[SPEAKER_22]: It's the little things in life that amuse me.

1388
01:48:24,724 --> 01:48:25,144
[SPEAKER_22]: Anyway, sorry.

1389
01:48:25,204 --> 01:48:26,905
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm going to immortalize that.

1390
01:48:27,825 --> 01:48:33,928
[SPEAKER_22]: Which, by the way, is what I think about a large part of the Bomani files that are being put out lately as shit, shit, shitty, shit, shit.

1391
01:48:34,348 --> 01:48:39,750
[SPEAKER_02]: And since you mentioned shit, shit, shitty, shit, shit, I have to mention the Mac

1392
01:48:40,165 --> 01:49:00,240
[SPEAKER_02]: SimFiles for the week, and starting off with Max Don't Have Sex With Your Ex, not exactly a Max Remix, but still, you know, falls under the Max category, Max 300, the Miss Remix, Max 300 Pack, which means probably more than one Max 300 in there, Max Max, Max Stinks, and Max 340.

1393
01:49:02,239 --> 01:49:03,120
[SPEAKER_02]: Max Stinks?

1394
01:49:03,760 --> 01:49:04,500
[SPEAKER_02]: Max Stink.

1395
01:49:05,141 --> 01:49:09,103
[SPEAKER_02]: No, not Max Stinks, as in Max Stink, like Maximum Stink.

1396
01:49:09,324 --> 01:49:11,625
[SPEAKER_22]: That sounds like an anti-deodorant.

1397
01:49:12,886 --> 01:49:16,228
[SPEAKER_22]: Like instead of, you know, like Right Guard Max, it's Max Stink.

1398
01:49:17,689 --> 01:49:19,870
[SPEAKER_22]: When you're going out on a date with an ugly.

1399
01:49:20,050 --> 01:49:25,174
[SPEAKER_02]: But to be fair, what I'm going to do is I'm going to download Max Stink to my PSP and play it on the DDR simulator.

1400
01:49:26,134 --> 01:49:26,314
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1401
01:49:27,095 --> 01:49:28,736
[SPEAKER_02]: No, actually, no I'm not, because I'm not going to waste that.

1402
01:49:29,497 --> 01:49:31,339
[SPEAKER_02]: Space on my PSP.

1403
01:49:32,900 --> 01:49:47,133
[SPEAKER_22]: Now, the other thing I was kind of curious about with PSP, hypothetically, couldn't you use that little USB adapter to hypothetically use a Kiki Joy to hypothetically put in a PlayStation 2, 2DX controller?

1404
01:49:47,513 --> 01:49:48,213
[SPEAKER_22]: No.

1405
01:49:49,034 --> 01:49:52,437
[SPEAKER_02]: No, because the way the USB things works.

1406
01:49:52,777 --> 01:49:55,400
[SPEAKER_02]: However, you could, in theory...

1407
01:49:56,637 --> 01:50:01,799
[SPEAKER_02]: Put a portable keyboard which uses the infrared port and use that for Beatmania.

1408
01:50:02,540 --> 01:50:03,340
[SPEAKER_20]: Now there's an idea.

1409
01:50:04,000 --> 01:50:05,221
[SPEAKER_22]: Or... And then it's like that one game.

1410
01:50:05,241 --> 01:50:06,762
[SPEAKER_22]: What was that Beatmania game?

1411
01:50:06,902 --> 01:50:09,983
[SPEAKER_22]: Da da da or something that they put out that was a keyboard Beatmania game?

1412
01:50:10,003 --> 01:50:11,524
[SPEAKER_22]: Oh my gosh.

1413
01:50:11,769 --> 01:50:38,458
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what's interesting, though, is the USB port, people are saying that you can't really put stuff in there, like, you know, peripherals and stuff, but they have that new Talkpad coming out for it, and it looks like, because the problem was they couldn't get power off of the port, there was no power going through it, so that's why it's not working, but I looked at the side of this port here, and there's these two little, like, copper contact points where the power comes through, so apparently you can get power

1414
01:50:40,517 --> 01:50:49,642
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess in theory you could hook up a dance pad, but why would you want to?

1415
01:50:50,082 --> 01:50:52,924
[SPEAKER_22]: Just imagine for a minute, holding a PSP while you're dancing.

1416
01:50:54,204 --> 01:50:57,166
[SPEAKER_22]: You know how stupid you'd look to someone who's coming by?

1417
01:50:59,407 --> 01:51:00,008
[SPEAKER_16]: Seriously.

1418
01:51:03,790 --> 01:51:05,851
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, I kind of have an idea what that would look like.

1419
01:51:06,772 --> 01:51:07,854
[SPEAKER_02]: I've done that with the controller before.

1420
01:51:23,715 --> 01:51:24,136
[SPEAKER_22]: and many more.

1421
01:51:42,489 --> 01:51:43,630
[SPEAKER_22]: Both would work, though, right?

1422
01:51:43,650 --> 01:51:53,059
[SPEAKER_22]: Because the PlayStation 2 has USB on it, and like you said, the PSP has the little power thing on it, so you could use your PSP to charge your iPod, which is a really stupid idea, if you think about it, but it would work, right?

1423
01:51:53,079 --> 01:51:59,685
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, the problem is that it's not a standard USB, it's the Mini-B, so you'd have to have some sort of adapter, but yes, I guess it's possible.

1424
01:52:00,305 --> 01:52:05,590
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if power's going directly to that all the time, I don't know, but I'd imagine it has to be.

1425
01:52:05,770 --> 01:52:07,411
[SPEAKER_22]: Maybe it'd have to be in USB mode for it to work.

1426
01:52:07,431 --> 01:52:07,792
[SPEAKER_02]: But there's...

1427
01:52:08,472 --> 01:52:15,838
[SPEAKER_02]: Like on everything, there's these copper contact points by all the AC adapter and also by the USB.

1428
01:52:16,339 --> 01:52:21,383
[SPEAKER_02]: I think this is for a cradle, is why they have that there, so you can just sit it down in something.

1429
01:52:21,643 --> 01:52:29,569
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, of course, the other one for the peripherals that go into it, because they have screw points where you can screw something in.

1430
01:52:30,550 --> 01:52:30,770
[SPEAKER_02]: But...

1431
01:52:32,119 --> 01:52:36,483
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I guess you could do that, but why would you want to, honestly?

1432
01:52:36,983 --> 01:52:39,646
[SPEAKER_22]: Because people will do something just because they can.

1433
01:52:39,706 --> 01:52:47,553
[SPEAKER_22]: Explain why people install Linux on a Billy Bass, on a toaster, on Hello Kitty watches.

1434
01:52:48,834 --> 01:52:50,115
[SPEAKER_22]: Why do people do that, Loki?

1435
01:52:50,195 --> 01:52:51,176
[SPEAKER_22]: Because they can.

1436
01:52:53,548 --> 01:52:59,696
[SPEAKER_22]: Seriously, I mean, if you figure out that you can charge your iPod using your PSP or whatever, aren't you going to show that to somebody?

1437
01:52:59,756 --> 01:53:03,400
[SPEAKER_22]: Like, dude, I can charge my iPod with my PSP.

1438
01:53:03,861 --> 01:53:05,383
[SPEAKER_22]: That's cool.

1439
01:53:05,403 --> 01:53:07,906
[SPEAKER_02]: You never hear me say that because I'll never have an iPod.

1440
01:53:07,926 --> 01:53:10,028
[SPEAKER_22]: I guess, I don't know.

1441
01:53:14,039 --> 01:53:15,120
[SPEAKER_22]: All right.

1442
01:53:15,520 --> 01:53:17,101
[SPEAKER_22]: Here's the status with Skype, you guys.

1443
01:53:17,121 --> 01:53:29,009
[SPEAKER_22]: We're trying to get into Skype, but the weird thing is whenever we try, and I realize I hear you guys in the chat room loud and clear saying you see us online, but I've tried calling the back number, the phone number that you can call to get into us too, and it's not working.

1444
01:53:29,129 --> 01:53:30,590
[SPEAKER_22]: It's not ringing on our computer.

1445
01:53:30,650 --> 01:53:32,932
[SPEAKER_22]: So even if you guys tried to call us, we are not seeing it.

1446
01:53:33,292 --> 01:53:36,216
[SPEAKER_22]: So even though you guys are seeing us logged in Skype, we are not actually there.

1447
01:53:36,537 --> 01:53:44,688
[SPEAKER_22]: We are trying to log in, but the problem is I'm getting caught in a loop on Skype is that I log in and then it says logging in and then kicks me back out to the login screen.

1448
01:53:44,708 --> 01:53:45,769
[SPEAKER_22]: So I don't know what's going on.

1449
01:53:46,450 --> 01:53:50,696
[SPEAKER_22]: Usually what I would do is I would just reset Skype or reinstall Skype to get this to work.

1450
01:53:50,956 --> 01:53:51,376
[SPEAKER_22]: DarkSakura.com

1451
01:54:09,224 --> 01:54:24,059
[SPEAKER_22]: at least we have the chat room if nothing else because we do want to hear what our listeners have to say and I want to hear about your thanksgivings and stuff very sorry about Skype but this is one of those things where it's kind of out of our ballpark right now so we'll keep trying I'm going to keep trying to hammer in there and clear some stuff out and see what I can do

1452
01:54:25,800 --> 01:54:27,101
[SPEAKER_22]: I can't wait for Animal Crossing

1453
01:54:45,566 --> 01:54:46,687
[SPEAKER_22]: You played it, how?

1454
01:54:47,227 --> 01:54:47,387
[SPEAKER_22]: At E3?

1455
01:54:47,627 --> 01:54:48,428
[SPEAKER_22]: At E3?

1456
01:54:48,728 --> 01:54:54,090
[SPEAKER_22]: Well, okay, so E3 answers some questions about it, but it doesn't tell us how online is going to work.

1457
01:54:54,130 --> 01:54:55,111
[SPEAKER_22]: That's really what I'm curious about.

1458
01:54:55,431 --> 01:54:58,713
[SPEAKER_22]: Can I go into DarkSakura's village and cut down all her trees?

1459
01:55:00,120 --> 01:55:03,004
[SPEAKER_22]: If you want DarkSakura to go into your village and set fire to it.

1460
01:55:04,065 --> 01:55:10,994
[SPEAKER_22]: Am I going to be able to go into DarkSakura's village and teach all of her villagers to say, you smell like butt?

1461
01:55:11,635 --> 01:55:15,660
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey, you had Olivia in my village.

1462
01:55:16,321 --> 01:55:18,603
[SPEAKER_08]: I was saying something rather foul.

1463
01:55:18,683 --> 01:55:20,065
[SPEAKER_22]: It was cunt, ladies and gentlemen.

1464
01:55:20,085 --> 01:55:20,865
[SPEAKER_22]: The word was cunt.

1465
01:55:21,085 --> 01:55:34,858
[SPEAKER_22]: I was sophomoric and juvenile, and I thought it was funny to get one of my Animal Crossing villagers to say cunt, but... It's hot at two... One of them moved into my... No, she moved into your village, and then I got her back, because she was my favorite.

1466
01:55:34,938 --> 01:55:35,779
[SPEAKER_08]: And she was foul.

1467
01:55:35,799 --> 01:55:38,821
[SPEAKER_08]: She was going around foul-mouthed, and then her neighbors started saying it, too.

1468
01:55:39,830 --> 01:55:48,175
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't remember who moved to my town, Big Cock, but it was funny everybody talking about Big Cock all the time.

1469
01:55:48,635 --> 01:55:49,575
[SPEAKER_08]: We had Danville.

1470
01:55:51,777 --> 01:55:52,457
[SPEAKER_08]: Because of Dan.

1471
01:55:53,237 --> 01:55:53,838
[SPEAKER_22]: Oh yeah, I remember that.

1472
01:55:53,858 --> 01:55:54,538
[SPEAKER_22]: You had Danville.

1473
01:55:54,678 --> 01:55:56,679
[SPEAKER_22]: I don't even remember what I called my town.

1474
01:55:57,019 --> 01:55:58,680
[SPEAKER_22]: It was Sky Place?

1475
01:55:58,700 --> 01:55:59,461
[SPEAKER_22]: I don't remember what it was.

1476
01:56:00,221 --> 01:56:00,701
[SPEAKER_08]: That's sad.

1477
01:56:00,741 --> 01:56:01,142
[SPEAKER_08]: I like Big Cock.

1478
01:56:01,162 --> 01:56:01,422
[SPEAKER_08]: I like that.

1479
01:56:07,711 --> 01:56:09,974
[SPEAKER_22]: We have Rob on air saying that he likes it.

1480
01:56:10,054 --> 01:56:10,495
[SPEAKER_22]: Shut up.

1481
01:56:10,815 --> 01:56:11,136
[SPEAKER_22]: Shut up.

1482
01:56:11,756 --> 01:56:14,320
[SPEAKER_22]: I hate you.

1483
01:56:21,448 --> 01:56:22,469
[SPEAKER_22]: Wow, that was scary.

1484
01:56:22,489 --> 01:56:27,910
[SPEAKER_22]: That didn't get all picked up on microphone, but Jamie went from laughing to like, ah!

1485
01:56:30,811 --> 01:56:31,711
[SPEAKER_22]: There she goes, sorry.

1486
01:56:32,051 --> 01:56:32,911
[SPEAKER_22]: Anyway.

1487
01:56:33,211 --> 01:56:35,132
[SPEAKER_08]: You try coughing up balloon cookies.

1488
01:56:35,152 --> 01:56:36,752
[SPEAKER_08]: See how loquacious it makes you.

1489
01:56:36,992 --> 01:56:42,674
[SPEAKER_22]: Here's what I remember about Animal Crossing is that I got that Olivia to say cunt, and she went back to your village.

1490
01:56:43,094 --> 01:56:47,955
[SPEAKER_22]: Then she went over to Iguana Girl's village, and those of you that know Iguana Girl knows that she hates cunts.

1491
01:56:48,135 --> 01:56:49,256
[SPEAKER_22]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1492
01:57:15,500 --> 01:57:17,601
[SPEAKER_22]: I don't remember I had the lesbian in my village too

1493
01:57:34,895 --> 01:57:36,796
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, there was lesbians.

1494
01:57:37,036 --> 01:57:42,780
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't remember what she was, but she was a lesbian because she lived in the gym teacher house and wore sweats all the time.

1495
01:57:43,340 --> 01:57:45,561
[SPEAKER_08]: So I put a big rainbow sign outside of her house.

1496
01:57:47,482 --> 01:57:51,064
[SPEAKER_22]: I remember you put the big rainbow sign and then you got her to say something like, you know, Big Dyke.

1497
01:57:51,245 --> 01:57:52,625
[SPEAKER_22]: No, I don't remember what it was.

1498
01:57:52,765 --> 01:57:56,848
[SPEAKER_08]: I thought we got her to say Real Gay or something.

1499
01:58:00,170 --> 01:58:00,730
[SPEAKER_22]: That's great.

1500
01:58:02,611 --> 01:58:03,872
[SPEAKER_22]: We are thinking now, I am...

1501
01:58:06,309 --> 01:58:13,513
[SPEAKER_22]: Oh, cool, they're saying in the new Animal Crossing you can teach outright phrases to animals rather than just sentence fragments and words.

1502
01:58:13,533 --> 01:58:16,755
[SPEAKER_08]: So I can teach my village lesbian to say that, never mind.

1503
01:58:17,736 --> 01:58:18,836
[SPEAKER_22]: I eat, never mind.

1504
01:58:19,577 --> 01:58:22,379
[SPEAKER_22]: If I say it, somebody's going to YTM and do it, so I can't do it.

1505
01:58:24,260 --> 01:58:26,301
[SPEAKER_22]: I fear our listener base all of a sudden.

1506
01:58:27,856 --> 01:58:30,817
[SPEAKER_22]: Although I do love the idea of like an Orange Lounge Radio Village.

1507
01:58:30,877 --> 01:58:31,877
[SPEAKER_22]: I don't know how we're going to do it.

1508
01:58:31,957 --> 01:58:33,458
[SPEAKER_22]: I guess it'll just have to be one of our towns.

1509
01:58:33,498 --> 01:58:38,199
[SPEAKER_22]: We will open up during the show and just let our listeners randomly come in and harass us during Orange Lounge.

1510
01:58:38,339 --> 01:58:42,761
[SPEAKER_22]: We'll have to recreate ourselves in Animal Crossing form and have our houses.

1511
01:58:42,801 --> 01:58:43,141
[SPEAKER_08]: Totally.

1512
01:58:43,221 --> 01:58:44,521
[SPEAKER_22]: Or maybe we'll come to your village.

1513
01:58:44,761 --> 01:58:48,163
[SPEAKER_22]: That could be the thing is that Orange Lounge Radio, we could party crash your village.

1514
01:58:48,243 --> 01:58:52,964
[SPEAKER_22]: Maybe like once a week somebody will give us a friend code and we'll go party crash in their village and destroy things.

1515
01:58:53,104 --> 01:58:55,285
[SPEAKER_22]: It'll be Orange Lounge Radio, burn and eat your village.

1516
01:58:56,505 --> 01:58:56,925
[SPEAKER_22]: I like this.

1517
01:58:56,945 --> 01:58:57,665
[SPEAKER_22]: This could be like a contest.

1518
01:58:57,685 --> 01:58:57,986
[SPEAKER_02]: That'd be great.

1519
01:58:58,026 --> 01:59:05,868
[SPEAKER_02]: We could have contests, you know, who could hit, you know, Loki with a bug net first, or... We also have them put out welcome signs.

1520
01:59:06,829 --> 01:59:08,729
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, we'll have... Make us shirts.

1521
01:59:10,310 --> 01:59:13,771
[SPEAKER_22]: Purchase our... Too bad you can't, like, sell stuff to other players.

1522
01:59:14,131 --> 01:59:17,253
[SPEAKER_22]: You know, on my Mario Kart 64...

1523
01:59:19,401 --> 01:59:27,242
[SPEAKER_22]: I used, because I suck at creating emblems, I used the little pre-made t-shirt one and I just wrote OLR on it, it was my first emblem, but I'm like, that's stupid.

1524
01:59:27,582 --> 01:59:31,723
[SPEAKER_22]: And then like when I would get into matches randomly on the internet, I know nobody's going to know what that means.

1525
01:59:32,103 --> 01:59:35,784
[SPEAKER_22]: So now mine is a big orange heart and it says in the heart, I can't draw.

1526
01:59:37,924 --> 01:59:39,104
[SPEAKER_22]: I wrote, I can't draw.

1527
01:59:40,085 --> 01:59:43,785
[SPEAKER_02]: Mine I actually went and did an old logo that I had designed.

1528
01:59:44,125 --> 01:59:48,546
[SPEAKER_02]: I was going to do, I wanted to get some skull and crossbones on there too, but I just stuck with Loki.

1529
01:59:49,884 --> 01:59:54,145
[SPEAKER_22]: Did you see the VG cat earlier talking about the logo on the car and it says, it's a penis?

1530
01:59:54,165 --> 01:59:55,565
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm going to link that to the chat room.

1531
02:00:17,079 --> 02:00:17,419
[SPEAKER_08]: Please do.

1532
02:00:17,639 --> 02:00:17,900
[SPEAKER_08]: It's good.

1533
02:00:36,294 --> 02:00:41,641
[SPEAKER_22]: Or, you know, maybe we'll just have to rely on our quick wit to fill some show.

1534
02:00:42,602 --> 02:00:43,544
[SPEAKER_22]: So we'll see what happens.

1535
02:00:44,725 --> 02:00:49,412
[SPEAKER_22]: In this break, I want to do a little bit of bequia, because I need some Korean music.

1536
02:00:50,173 --> 02:00:51,074
[SPEAKER_22]: So we're going to do bequia.

1537
02:00:51,094 --> 02:00:52,616
[SPEAKER_22]: We'll be back after this with more Orange Laundry.

1538
02:02:43,291 --> 02:02:55,860
I came in from a rainy Thursday on the avenue Thought I heard you talking softly I turned on the lights, the TV, and the radio Still I can't escape the ghost of you What is happening?

1539
02:03:54,054 --> 02:03:54,583
and more.

1540
02:04:23,483 --> 02:04:24,228
Thanks for watching!

1541
02:05:28,764 --> 02:05:29,605
Thanks for watching!

1542
02:06:02,293 --> 02:06:03,654
Thank you for watching!

1543
02:06:39,967 --> 02:06:41,550
Don't lie on paradise!

1544
02:06:41,590 --> 02:06:43,493
Do you like it or hate it?

1545
02:06:43,734 --> 02:06:45,196
It's all up to you!

1546
02:06:45,216 --> 02:06:48,802
[SPEAKER_07]: The blue one will take you for a clarion!

1547
02:07:23,800 --> 02:07:24,220
[SPEAKER_22]: Hello?

1548
02:07:25,000 --> 02:07:25,281
[SPEAKER_22]: Hello?

1549
02:07:25,321 --> 02:07:26,021
[SPEAKER_22]: Is this thing on?

1550
02:07:26,081 --> 02:07:26,581
[SPEAKER_22]: Testing.

1551
02:07:27,761 --> 02:07:28,642
[SPEAKER_22]: Testing 1-2.

1552
02:07:29,202 --> 02:07:33,143
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm looking in the index, but I don't see anything for how to run a radio show.

1553
02:07:33,243 --> 02:07:33,723
[SPEAKER_22]: Hello?

1554
02:07:34,384 --> 02:07:35,844
[SPEAKER_22]: I don't understand this.

1555
02:07:35,864 --> 02:07:37,225
[SPEAKER_08]: Does this thing work?

1556
02:07:37,245 --> 02:07:38,845
[SPEAKER_08]: This thing reads like stereo instructions.

1557
02:07:38,865 --> 02:07:39,525
[SPEAKER_08]: Is this on?

1558
02:07:39,545 --> 02:07:40,126
[SPEAKER_08]: What the hell?

1559
02:07:42,687 --> 02:07:44,087
[SPEAKER_18]: Orange Lounge Radio.

1560
02:07:44,267 --> 02:07:46,448
[SPEAKER_18]: Broke down Ghetto Bomani Radio.

1561
02:07:46,468 --> 02:07:46,868
[SPEAKER_07]: What the?

1562
02:07:50,307 --> 02:07:53,690
[SPEAKER_22]: You're telling me, Broke Down, Get Over My Radio, we can't get our Skype tour tonight.

1563
02:07:53,970 --> 02:07:57,333
[SPEAKER_22]: I think it's going to be a wash for Skype tonight, because I'm getting the same problem when I get back in there.

1564
02:07:57,353 --> 02:08:00,936
[SPEAKER_22]: I had one of our listeners try calling us during the break there, trying to get in.

1565
02:08:01,456 --> 02:08:01,957
[SPEAKER_22]: No workie.

1566
02:08:02,717 --> 02:08:04,659
[SPEAKER_22]: So I think Skype might be down tonight.

1567
02:08:04,699 --> 02:08:05,680
[SPEAKER_22]: We will keep trying.

1568
02:08:05,700 --> 02:08:06,441
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm not going to lose hope.

1569
02:08:06,541 --> 02:08:08,963
[SPEAKER_22]: If we can fit in even one call.

1570
02:08:09,043 --> 02:08:11,024
[SPEAKER_22]: It caught your whooping cough or something.

1571
02:08:11,825 --> 02:08:14,307
[SPEAKER_22]: If we can fit in even one call before the end of the show, we will do it.

1572
02:08:14,347 --> 02:08:18,771
[SPEAKER_22]: But, you know, this show existed for like a year and a half before we ever had Skype, so we will...

1573
02:08:19,131 --> 02:08:20,992
[SPEAKER_22]: Of course, then again, the show was only two hours then, too.

1574
02:08:21,372 --> 02:08:24,033
[SPEAKER_22]: But we'll find a way to get through this somehow.

1575
02:08:24,553 --> 02:08:27,815
[SPEAKER_22]: And I realize you guys are seeing us online.

1576
02:08:27,935 --> 02:08:33,897
[SPEAKER_22]: I assure you guys, even though we are somehow showing us online, we are not getting the pop-up box that shows us we have a call.

1577
02:08:34,197 --> 02:08:35,398
[SPEAKER_22]: Therefore, we cannot take your call.

1578
02:08:36,138 --> 02:08:40,400
[SPEAKER_22]: We thought about patching through DarkSakura's laptop, but unfortunately, that is not an option either.

1579
02:08:40,760 --> 02:08:41,881
[SPEAKER_22]: I told you I can't go wrong if I pick Damon.

1580
02:09:10,933 --> 02:09:11,954
[SPEAKER_22]: You know why you won?

1581
02:09:12,034 --> 02:09:14,975
[SPEAKER_22]: Because Roz was rallying the troops in the chat room for you, I think.

1582
02:09:16,556 --> 02:09:20,698
[SPEAKER_22]: That was a big part of the reason why I think you got it.

1583
02:09:20,938 --> 02:09:21,658
[SPEAKER_22]: So, good job.

1584
02:09:22,279 --> 02:09:40,788
[SPEAKER_22]: Blur wins, and we'll go into rotation on our Bomani Video Game Music program, which, by the way, I updated in some capacity this week, and we're going to take a look at the Video Game Music portion very soon, but Bomani got a little bit of a facelift, and that is all based on your scores that come up in the... For those of you that listen through Live 365 and not through iTunes, you get little

1585
02:09:40,828 --> 02:09:42,278
[SPEAKER_22]: Little thumbs up and thumbs down icon

1586
02:09:43,035 --> 02:09:44,836
[SPEAKER_22]: You can actually, whoa, my stupid microphone.

1587
02:09:45,056 --> 02:09:49,019
[SPEAKER_22]: You get a little thumbs up and thumbs down icon where you can actually rate the songs as they play.

1588
02:09:50,159 --> 02:09:53,961
[SPEAKER_22]: So we actually took out a couple of the Bomani songs that were very low rated.

1589
02:09:54,482 --> 02:09:57,604
[SPEAKER_22]: Some of the stuff from Ultramix 2, some of the old, old songs.

1590
02:09:57,644 --> 02:10:04,388
[SPEAKER_22]: We just kind of flushed out of there and put in some of the good Ultramix 3 songs and Happy Sky and some other stuff too.

1591
02:10:04,428 --> 02:10:06,309
[SPEAKER_22]: We just kind of filled it out.

1592
02:10:06,549 --> 02:10:10,591
[SPEAKER_22]: I threw in a new Castlevania song for good measure just because I was like, oh, this song should be in rotation.

1593
02:10:10,611 --> 02:10:11,712
[SPEAKER_22]: So I snuck one new one in there.

1594
02:10:16,707 --> 02:10:18,688
[SPEAKER_22]: This microphone is pissing me off.

1595
02:10:18,788 --> 02:10:21,109
[SPEAKER_22]: Anyway, I hate this mic.

1596
02:10:22,270 --> 02:10:25,412
[SPEAKER_22]: That's what we need to use our $25 just to get on as a replacement mic.

1597
02:10:25,632 --> 02:10:28,494
[SPEAKER_08]: We need to actually put down some money and get good mics.

1598
02:10:28,554 --> 02:10:31,455
[SPEAKER_22]: We should invest it, and then in a year we could have a good mic.

1599
02:10:32,096 --> 02:10:32,716
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, a good mic.

1600
02:10:33,756 --> 02:10:44,883
[SPEAKER_22]: Because that microphone that you're using there would be about what we could afford if we invested the $25, because that's one that Angel very kindly donated to us, and that's... You know this, for years that mic's been lasting pretty long.

1601
02:10:45,303 --> 02:10:45,423
It's...

1602
02:10:45,851 --> 02:10:46,712
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, that one's not bad.

1603
02:10:47,492 --> 02:10:49,514
[SPEAKER_22]: You know what?

1604
02:10:51,755 --> 02:10:55,238
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm about ready to go just buy my own top dollar mic.

1605
02:10:56,159 --> 02:10:56,659
[SPEAKER_22]: That would be nice.

1606
02:10:56,679 --> 02:10:58,260
[SPEAKER_22]: Well, that's a great mic.

1607
02:10:58,320 --> 02:10:58,761
[SPEAKER_22]: It really is.

1608
02:10:58,781 --> 02:11:00,142
[SPEAKER_22]: The one you're using is a fabulous mic.

1609
02:11:00,442 --> 02:11:04,005
[SPEAKER_22]: But it costs this much times eight.

1610
02:11:04,585 --> 02:11:07,728
[SPEAKER_22]: It costs that much times eight is how much that costs, according to Angel.

1611
02:11:08,188 --> 02:11:08,528
[SPEAKER_22]: Oh, yeah.

1612
02:11:08,828 --> 02:11:09,229
[SPEAKER_22]: Wow.

1613
02:11:09,249 --> 02:11:10,450
[SPEAKER_22]: Anyway.

1614
02:11:15,283 --> 02:11:22,348
[SPEAKER_22]: Um, and I see some people in the room bitching about my microphone suggestion to turn up the mixing board's mic boost until the microphone works.

1615
02:11:22,688 --> 02:11:32,175
[SPEAKER_22]: Unfortunately, that doesn't work right because the problem with this microphone is it's what we call, um, I think they call it unidirectional, which means it only works if the microphone is pointing

1616
02:11:32,555 --> 02:11:33,796
[SPEAKER_22]: in one particular direction.

1617
02:11:33,816 --> 02:11:38,318
[SPEAKER_22]: And it's really good for reporters who are trying to interview someone who don't want to get all that background noise.

1618
02:11:38,858 --> 02:11:44,260
[SPEAKER_22]: But the problem is, usually what you get is a cardio-shaped microphone, which is like a heart-shaped audio pattern.

1619
02:11:44,440 --> 02:11:49,102
[SPEAKER_22]: Or you have a, I think, omni-directional microphone, which is you can pick up sound in all directions.

1620
02:11:49,482 --> 02:11:52,164
[SPEAKER_22]: And DarkSakura and Loki have omni-directional microphones.

1621
02:11:52,484 --> 02:11:55,365
[SPEAKER_22]: So no matter which way they're holding the microphone, it's picking up their sound.

1622
02:11:55,725 --> 02:11:59,467
[SPEAKER_22]: Unfortunately, with this microphone, if I turn it just a little bit too far one direction,

1623
02:11:59,847 --> 02:12:03,809
[SPEAKER_22]: You suddenly lose the voice and you don't hear me as well.

1624
02:12:04,069 --> 02:12:07,350
[SPEAKER_22]: So I have to talk specifically into one part of this microphone or it doesn't work.

1625
02:12:08,230 --> 02:12:12,512
[SPEAKER_22]: And the problem is that I'm not necessarily used to this microphone, so that's why you get a lot of weird sound out of this.

1626
02:12:12,792 --> 02:12:14,093
[SPEAKER_22]: So, go figure.

1627
02:12:15,333 --> 02:12:17,014
[SPEAKER_08]: You still sound more normal than I do.

1628
02:12:18,014 --> 02:12:19,095
[SPEAKER_22]: Eh, to some extent.

1629
02:12:19,735 --> 02:12:23,077
[SPEAKER_22]: And then people are saying in the chat room, oh, my headset mic only cost me $8.

1630
02:12:23,117 --> 02:12:26,278
[SPEAKER_22]: The problem is that we used to use those headsets...

1631
02:12:27,776 --> 02:12:30,997
[SPEAKER_22]: Hey, and the headsets that I brought were expensive.

1632
02:12:31,538 --> 02:12:34,059
[SPEAKER_22]: And they were... They were call center headsets.

1633
02:12:34,139 --> 02:12:36,440
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, and the problem is they kind of sounded like call center.

1634
02:12:36,480 --> 02:12:37,720
[SPEAKER_22]: They didn't... They were good.

1635
02:12:37,760 --> 02:12:38,421
[SPEAKER_22]: They worked at the time.

1636
02:12:38,441 --> 02:12:38,781
[SPEAKER_22]: They were free.

1637
02:12:39,321 --> 02:12:42,062
[SPEAKER_22]: But remember that very, very, very first mic we had?

1638
02:12:42,102 --> 02:12:43,203
[SPEAKER_22]: It was the guest microphone.

1639
02:12:43,263 --> 02:12:47,605
[SPEAKER_22]: It was this little, tiny $10 microphone that sounded like you were talking out of two Dixie Cups and a string.

1640
02:12:47,685 --> 02:12:48,065
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

1641
02:12:48,205 --> 02:12:50,206
[SPEAKER_08]: I wish I had... What happened to the boom mic?

1642
02:12:51,106 --> 02:12:51,827
[SPEAKER_22]: The boom mic?

1643
02:12:52,287 --> 02:12:54,288
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, the big... Oh, the boom mic.

1644
02:12:54,308 --> 02:12:54,668
[SPEAKER_22]: Whatever.

1645
02:12:54,688 --> 02:12:55,869
[SPEAKER_22]: That's at Loki's house.

1646
02:12:55,929 --> 02:12:56,549
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, it's still my house.

1647
02:12:57,149 --> 02:13:01,092
[SPEAKER_22]: The boom mic was our idea because we used to have a lot of sidebar conversations.

1648
02:13:01,933 --> 02:13:05,936
[SPEAKER_22]: Because in the old place, in the old studio, we would have like 10 people that could fit in the studio.

1649
02:13:06,256 --> 02:13:07,697
[SPEAKER_22]: It was an ambient mic.

1650
02:13:07,757 --> 02:13:10,359
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, and the boom mic was supposed to pick up sidebar conversations.

1651
02:13:10,379 --> 02:13:13,542
[SPEAKER_22]: It was to kind of encourage people to shut the F up while we're trying to do a show.

1652
02:13:14,302 --> 02:13:17,705
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it was supposed to be so you could hear people yelling in the background.

1653
02:13:19,106 --> 02:13:19,566
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh, that too.

1654
02:13:20,607 --> 02:13:21,848
[SPEAKER_02]: It worked pretty good for what we had.

1655
02:13:21,908 --> 02:13:23,129
[SPEAKER_22]: It worked okay.

1656
02:13:23,569 --> 02:13:24,470
[SPEAKER_22]: It was kind of hit and miss.

1657
02:13:24,972 --> 02:13:28,135
[SPEAKER_02]: It was hidden, so no one knew where it was, so they couldn't talk into it.

1658
02:13:28,255 --> 02:13:28,716
[SPEAKER_22]: Exactly.

1659
02:13:29,076 --> 02:13:29,476
[SPEAKER_22]: That's good.

1660
02:13:30,778 --> 02:13:31,058
[SPEAKER_22]: All right.

1661
02:13:32,459 --> 02:13:40,266
[SPEAKER_22]: I think what we'll do now, because I'm feeling a little angsty about the Skype line not working, is I think now would be a very good time for us to get into the FUs of the week.

1662
02:13:41,127 --> 02:13:43,190
[SPEAKER_22]: DarkSakura, why do we do the FUs of the week every single week?

1663
02:14:09,960 --> 02:14:11,241
[SPEAKER_08]: God, I haven't heard that in a while.

1664
02:14:12,081 --> 02:14:15,844
[SPEAKER_08]: Big F you goes toward whatever the disease of the week is.

1665
02:14:16,724 --> 02:14:22,168
[SPEAKER_08]: Apparently I went from a cold to a sinus infection to bronchitis to pneumonia to whipping cough.

1666
02:14:22,888 --> 02:14:28,131
[SPEAKER_08]: And I kind of miss knowing what my voice sounds like other than listening to our old bumpers on the station.

1667
02:14:29,832 --> 02:14:33,435
[SPEAKER_08]: And F you to me getting motion sick from playing We Love Katamari.

1668
02:14:35,416 --> 02:14:59,877
[SPEAKER_08]: and FU goes to me not having any more time off for the rest of the year and also having to put off my trip to London until 2007 and also to whoever that was that double parked in your parking lot because they suck they suck quite a bit and also FU to me not having any hot tea right now good let's go over to Loki and see where his angst is

1669
02:15:01,594 --> 02:15:05,336
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, my angst is with, um, games being boring.

1670
02:15:05,617 --> 02:15:08,018
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, for example, um, Shadow Colossus.

1671
02:15:08,398 --> 02:15:10,880
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm getting quite bored with that game really quick.

1672
02:15:11,780 --> 02:15:14,642
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so, yeah, I have to sell that back now.

1673
02:15:14,882 --> 02:15:18,765
[SPEAKER_02]: Fuck you, this Microsoft for not saying out quite enough Xbox 360s.

1674
02:15:18,945 --> 02:15:20,446
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I know you want to drive a pipe.

1675
02:15:20,486 --> 02:15:20,986
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1676
02:15:21,206 --> 02:15:24,248
[SPEAKER_02]: You're not going to do that by really cryptic, um, commercials.

1677
02:15:24,268 --> 02:15:27,150
[SPEAKER_02]: You need a commercial that screams, wow, this is kick-ass.

1678
02:15:27,190 --> 02:15:28,111
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, you got to get it.

1679
02:15:28,831 --> 02:15:30,352
[SPEAKER_02]: Watching people throw water balloons.

1680
02:15:30,919 --> 02:15:50,927
[SPEAKER_02]: does not scream, wow, this is kickass, or watching people jump rope, no, that is not kickass, that tells me, go outside, that's what that says, so, you might be marketing that to the wrong people, um, then finally, um, fuck you McDonald's, because no matter how simple I make my orders, they just can't seem to get them right.

1681
02:15:54,266 --> 02:15:55,447
[SPEAKER_08]: I didn't have a problem today.

1682
02:15:56,188 --> 02:15:59,491
[SPEAKER_08]: I never have a problem with McDonald's in my order.

1683
02:15:59,611 --> 02:15:59,971
[SPEAKER_02]: I do it myself.

1684
02:15:59,991 --> 02:16:00,331
[SPEAKER_02]: I do it myself.

1685
02:16:11,528 --> 02:16:12,949
[SPEAKER_22]: I have tea bags if you want some hot tea.

1686
02:16:13,650 --> 02:16:13,950
[SPEAKER_22]: You sure?

1687
02:16:14,190 --> 02:16:15,351
[SPEAKER_08]: I want my herbs from home.

1688
02:16:15,471 --> 02:16:16,412
[SPEAKER_08]: I have peppermint.

1689
02:16:16,452 --> 02:16:18,013
[SPEAKER_22]: I only have shitty Lipton, sorry.

1690
02:16:18,573 --> 02:16:20,254
[SPEAKER_22]: I have shitty Lipton green tea, too.

1691
02:16:21,615 --> 02:16:24,257
[SPEAKER_08]: I've been making peppermint and white willow tea.

1692
02:16:24,417 --> 02:16:25,077
[SPEAKER_22]: Oh, that sounds good.

1693
02:16:25,278 --> 02:16:26,799
[SPEAKER_08]: White willow is nasty shit.

1694
02:16:27,079 --> 02:16:28,360
[SPEAKER_22]: Egyptian licorice is my favorite.

1695
02:16:28,740 --> 02:16:29,420
[SPEAKER_22]: Ew.

1696
02:16:29,460 --> 02:16:30,481
[SPEAKER_02]: I hate licorice.

1697
02:16:30,861 --> 02:16:35,585
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to be online playing Mario Kart DS after this show, briefly between show and podcast.

1698
02:16:36,185 --> 02:16:37,306
[SPEAKER_21]: You should get some friend codes.

1699
02:16:38,302 --> 02:16:41,767
[SPEAKER_02]: I have friend codes, but I can never catch anyone online.

1700
02:16:41,847 --> 02:16:44,371
[SPEAKER_02]: So just let them know and give them fair warning.

1701
02:16:46,013 --> 02:16:46,314
[SPEAKER_22]: My turn.

1702
02:16:48,176 --> 02:16:53,064
[SPEAKER_22]: If you did the fact that I have to go back to work tomorrow after...

1703
02:16:54,212 --> 02:16:58,335
[SPEAKER_22]: Four days of not having to work because you kind of get used to not working and then you have to go back to work.

1704
02:16:58,615 --> 02:17:06,421
[SPEAKER_22]: Tomorrow's going to kind of be a busy day, too, just because it's like one of those things, you know, especially when you're kind of in the role that I play at my organization.

1705
02:17:06,481 --> 02:17:07,922
[SPEAKER_22]: It's kind of like I've got to find my groove.

1706
02:17:08,522 --> 02:17:10,804
[SPEAKER_22]: Rob's got to get his groove back, like Stella.

1707
02:17:11,144 --> 02:17:15,567
[SPEAKER_22]: I've got to get my groove back, and it's not something that's going to click at 8 o'clock in the morning tomorrow.

1708
02:17:15,587 --> 02:17:17,449
[SPEAKER_22]: So I'm going to be very groggy and bitchy tomorrow.

1709
02:17:17,789 --> 02:17:21,732
[SPEAKER_22]: And if you do the fact that I way overslept this weekend, I mean, seriously, I've been sleeping like...

1710
02:17:22,492 --> 02:17:23,654
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you for watching!

1711
02:17:38,385 --> 02:17:44,809
[SPEAKER_22]: I think if I could have just hibernated for the past four days, it would have been great.

1712
02:17:45,729 --> 02:17:51,093
[SPEAKER_22]: An F you to the fact that I couldn't get an Xbox 360 even if I wanted one.

1713
02:17:51,413 --> 02:17:53,874
[SPEAKER_22]: And an F you to the fact that a lot of video games are $50, like the new ones.

1714
02:17:53,894 --> 02:17:54,455
[SPEAKER_22]: $50 is a lot of money. $60.

1715
02:17:56,896 --> 02:18:01,262
[SPEAKER_22]: Well, yeah, Xbox 360 is like $60, but even like, you know, current-gen platforms are $50.

1716
02:18:01,702 --> 02:18:05,186
[SPEAKER_22]: Sometimes, if you're lucky, $30 or $40, but Dragon Quest VIII set me back $50.

1717
02:18:05,287 --> 02:18:10,573
[SPEAKER_22]: It's kind of like, boy, oh boy, I better get 100 hours of playtime out of that game or something to make it worth it.

1718
02:18:10,953 --> 02:18:11,754
[SPEAKER_22]: Otherwise, I'm going to be pissed.

1719
02:18:12,535 --> 02:18:14,617
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, so F you to expensive things.

1720
02:18:15,078 --> 02:18:15,618
[SPEAKER_22]: That's not fun.

1721
02:18:17,540 --> 02:18:22,164
[SPEAKER_22]: All right, let's go to the chatroom FUs, of which I'm sure there are plenty this week.

1722
02:18:22,605 --> 02:18:23,666
[SPEAKER_22]: Let's see what's going on there.

1723
02:18:26,328 --> 02:18:26,648
[SPEAKER_22]: Let's see.

1724
02:18:27,469 --> 02:18:43,556
[SPEAKER_22]: Rene wants to give a big huge FU to Best Buy and McDonald's for making me gather $21, Best Buy dollars, and when I finally get to use them on Ultramix 3, the website, LOL at Loki, the damn game gets on backorder, so I had to buy at full price at GameStop and get a refund.

1725
02:18:43,996 --> 02:18:53,180
[SPEAKER_22]: Another FU to the manager at a nearby EB Games, where I was considering buying Ultramix 3 when he hangs up because he thinks I'm a rival manager letting him know that the game is out already.

1726
02:18:54,949 --> 02:18:55,850
[SPEAKER_22]: and my last F.U.

1727
02:18:55,870 --> 02:18:59,294
[SPEAKER_22]: to a wasp that took four hits with a large towel to take down.

1728
02:19:02,657 --> 02:19:03,298
[SPEAKER_22]: My next F.U.

1729
02:19:03,338 --> 02:19:04,959
[SPEAKER_22]: comes from Sephiroth1215.

1730
02:19:05,420 --> 02:19:05,560
[SPEAKER_22]: F.U.

1731
02:19:05,580 --> 02:19:07,782
[SPEAKER_22]: to my teacher giving work over Thanksgiving.

1732
02:19:08,643 --> 02:19:14,629
[SPEAKER_22]: Remember back in the day when we were in high school and those bitches would give us homework over Christmas break?

1733
02:19:14,669 --> 02:19:15,891
[SPEAKER_22]: It's like, read this book!

1734
02:19:17,499 --> 02:19:19,021
[SPEAKER_08]: I really enjoyed reading books.

1735
02:19:20,002 --> 02:19:22,986
[SPEAKER_22]: I enjoyed reading books too, but not the crap that our teachers assigned us.

1736
02:19:23,446 --> 02:19:25,088
[SPEAKER_22]: I liked reading contemporary stuff.

1737
02:19:25,809 --> 02:19:31,615
[SPEAKER_22]: And I remember to this day the book I hated that I had to read in high school was Dandelion Wine.

1738
02:19:31,635 --> 02:19:32,977
[SPEAKER_22]: I hated that book.

1739
02:19:33,852 --> 02:19:35,934
[SPEAKER_22]: Dandelion Wine, The Inferno, The Odyssey,

1740
02:19:54,997 --> 02:19:55,937
[SPEAKER_07]: They had no choice.

1741
02:19:56,017 --> 02:19:57,038
[SPEAKER_07]: I wrote my book report.

1742
02:19:57,118 --> 02:19:57,878
[SPEAKER_07]: And look at the book!

1743
02:19:58,378 --> 02:19:59,398
[SPEAKER_22]: Interesting.

1744
02:20:01,199 --> 02:20:02,840
[SPEAKER_22]: What was the book?

1745
02:20:03,340 --> 02:20:04,480
[SPEAKER_22]: 1984, but our class didn't do that one.

1746
02:20:04,500 --> 02:20:06,481
[SPEAKER_22]: We did Brave New World, which was just as weird.

1747
02:20:07,061 --> 02:20:08,621
[SPEAKER_22]: You know, we did Catcher in the Rye, which was cool.

1748
02:20:08,661 --> 02:20:09,762
[SPEAKER_22]: I enjoyed doing Catcher in the Rye.

1749
02:20:10,422 --> 02:20:11,742
[SPEAKER_08]: I hated the Grapes of Wrath.

1750
02:20:12,303 --> 02:20:13,503
[SPEAKER_22]: Fuck the Grapes of Wrath.

1751
02:20:13,523 --> 02:20:14,763
[SPEAKER_22]: Oh my god, we had to do that one too.

1752
02:20:15,103 --> 02:20:23,306
[SPEAKER_22]: Anyway, Sephiroth1215 also says, and F you to Tecmo for pushing back DOA4 because I want another 360 game that is actually good.

1753
02:20:23,806 --> 02:20:30,647
[SPEAKER_22]: Oh, and Sephiroth1215 would like to say he's actually in college, not... Fuck it, Mike.

1754
02:20:30,667 --> 02:20:31,568
[SPEAKER_22]: Same thing with college.

1755
02:20:31,928 --> 02:20:32,288
[SPEAKER_22]: Seriously.

1756
02:20:36,055 --> 02:20:42,359
[SPEAKER_22]: Dark Knight says, F you to Black Friday, F you to losing my stylist, I had to buy a new one, F you to being single for 18 years.

1757
02:20:44,039 --> 02:20:44,960
[SPEAKER_22]: I would buy him a horn.

1758
02:20:45,200 --> 02:20:46,701
[SPEAKER_22]: Seriously, I mean, that's why I'm kidding.

1759
02:20:47,181 --> 02:20:47,862
[SPEAKER_22]: Hold on to it.

1760
02:20:48,722 --> 02:20:50,523
[SPEAKER_02]: My stylist got eaten by my couch.

1761
02:20:51,924 --> 02:20:52,764
[SPEAKER_08]: I have a spare.

1762
02:20:54,885 --> 02:20:57,387
[SPEAKER_08]: Dan bought me a silver one that matches my DS.

1763
02:21:03,343 --> 02:21:07,545
[SPEAKER_22]: You know you can buy those styluses in like the little color packs so you have like a purple stylus?

1764
02:21:07,585 --> 02:21:08,785
[SPEAKER_22]: We have the three packs.

1765
02:21:08,825 --> 02:21:13,627
[SPEAKER_07]: We have the black one, the blue one, and the silver one.

1766
02:21:13,647 --> 02:21:14,507
[SPEAKER_07]: So I have a silver one.

1767
02:21:14,587 --> 02:21:15,587
[SPEAKER_20]: I want a purple one.

1768
02:21:18,028 --> 02:21:19,489
[SPEAKER_20]: God, I hate you like I'm a purple school.

1769
02:21:20,990 --> 02:21:21,550
[SPEAKER_20]: Alright, moving on.

1770
02:21:21,650 --> 02:21:24,212
[SPEAKER_20]: Roz... Seriously.

1771
02:21:24,672 --> 02:21:27,694
[SPEAKER_22]: Roz wants to say an F you to Graham Coxon.

1772
02:21:27,734 --> 02:21:33,136
[SPEAKER_22]: That sexy bitch delayed his new album release from Fall 2005 to March 16th, 2006.

1773
02:21:34,297 --> 02:21:36,338
[SPEAKER_22]: Nice way to work in that plug, by the way.

1774
02:21:36,378 --> 02:21:40,120
[SPEAKER_22]: Ron Chan says, F you to people that drop out of races on Mario Kart DS.

1775
02:21:40,160 --> 02:21:41,501
[SPEAKER_22]: Take your beatings like a man.

1776
02:21:43,002 --> 02:21:47,184
[SPEAKER_22]: Neo Dude Zero says, F you to crappy Linksys USB Internet adapters.

1777
02:21:47,264 --> 02:21:49,405
[SPEAKER_22]: I've been in and out of both show and chat all night.

1778
02:21:51,667 --> 02:21:54,768
[SPEAKER_22]: Vander C says, F you to Jamie for slapping me with a trout.

1779
02:21:54,848 --> 02:21:55,609
[SPEAKER_22]: I don't like trout.

1780
02:21:57,690 --> 02:22:00,031
[SPEAKER_22]: Tell him to stay tuned for my response.

1781
02:22:01,391 --> 02:22:03,572
[SPEAKER_22]: You need to slap him with a grilled salmon.

1782
02:22:03,812 --> 02:22:06,953
[SPEAKER_22]: Or slap him with a chili bass.

1783
02:22:06,973 --> 02:22:09,034
[SPEAKER_22]: The macro is for trout.

1784
02:22:09,214 --> 02:22:09,555
[SPEAKER_22]: I know.

1785
02:22:09,575 --> 02:22:11,795
[SPEAKER_22]: Alright.

1786
02:22:13,096 --> 02:22:17,838
[SPEAKER_22]: Tomo Kun says, Fuck me neglecting this show and the podcast for weeks upon weeks upon weeks.

1787
02:22:18,158 --> 02:22:18,738
[SPEAKER_22]: I agree.

1788
02:22:19,679 --> 02:22:19,919
[SPEAKER_22]: F you.

1789
02:22:21,147 --> 02:22:23,409
[SPEAKER_22]: Oh, and fuck you whoever sends me the same piece of spam.

1790
02:22:52,608 --> 02:23:06,273
[SPEAKER_22]: ColorOfSakura says, F you to not getting enough hours at work, F you to Mario Kart's DS's lack of good Wi-Fi interface, F you to the Xbox 360, F you to sickness, F you to getting my 2DX controller in the mail and it being broken.

1791
02:23:08,775 --> 02:23:14,658
[SPEAKER_22]: Legend of Zaku says, F you to not investing $400 earlier this year, it's like getting Xbox 360 for me to sell on eBay now.

1792
02:23:15,238 --> 02:23:17,439
[SPEAKER_22]: F you to sake not being as strong as I thought it would be.

1793
02:23:18,019 --> 02:23:23,542
[SPEAKER_22]: F you to fucking ants that invaded my box of rice-a-roni, thus forging me to ditch that box and use up another.

1794
02:23:23,562 --> 02:23:25,703
[SPEAKER_22]: I ought to be in college again.

1795
02:23:26,223 --> 02:23:31,106
[SPEAKER_22]: F you to all other game stores for trying to offer me pennies for Madden 06 and NBA Live 06.

1796
02:23:31,546 --> 02:23:35,208
[SPEAKER_22]: Lucky me, I knew this place around my way that gave me $50 for both of them.

1797
02:23:36,554 --> 02:23:44,741
[SPEAKER_22]: and Nintendo Maniac would like to say, or Nintendo Maniac 64, says, F you to the weather for there being lots of snow and a possible snow day on Thanksgiving week.

1798
02:23:45,602 --> 02:23:49,605
[SPEAKER_22]: F you to my computer for locking up a few minutes ago, preventing me from not knowing it's F you time.

1799
02:23:50,085 --> 02:23:55,230
[SPEAKER_22]: F you to myself for putting a knot in my last F you when it was supposed to be there.

1800
02:23:55,350 --> 02:23:55,510
[SPEAKER_22]: What?

1801
02:23:55,770 --> 02:23:56,511
[SPEAKER_22]: It wasn't supposed to be there.

1802
02:23:57,211 --> 02:24:11,905
[SPEAKER_22]: F you to myself for building a DS LEGO charging deck which took up my charger and I had to partially disassemble it to get my charger out so I could play Mario Kart DS without my DS's battery dying.

1803
02:24:14,048 --> 02:24:15,349
[SPEAKER_22]: Mine still won't fit together.

1804
02:24:19,863 --> 02:24:21,904
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, I liked your little Lego charger that you had there.

1805
02:24:21,924 --> 02:24:23,324
[SPEAKER_22]: That was kind of cool stuff.

1806
02:24:24,504 --> 02:24:25,144
[SPEAKER_22]: I missed that thing.

1807
02:24:25,184 --> 02:24:25,565
[SPEAKER_22]: It was cool.

1808
02:24:25,605 --> 02:24:28,345
[SPEAKER_22]: I should get some Legos and build me a Lego base.

1809
02:24:28,385 --> 02:24:30,966
[SPEAKER_22]: What I also liked about it is that you can put your games and your styluses in it.

1810
02:24:30,986 --> 02:24:31,746
[SPEAKER_22]: I thought that was kind of cool.

1811
02:24:31,846 --> 02:24:37,627
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, except every now and then it's sitting on my cabinet and every now and then I knock into it and it falls over and it breaks.

1812
02:24:38,108 --> 02:24:39,608
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, I don't have that many games.

1813
02:24:40,468 --> 02:24:41,068
[SPEAKER_02]: But it works good.

1814
02:24:41,568 --> 02:24:42,529
[SPEAKER_02]: It works good for charging.

1815
02:24:45,009 --> 02:24:48,330
[SPEAKER_08]: Can you use hot glue and you put it together and it'll never fall apart?

1816
02:24:49,366 --> 02:24:56,478
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, and then you'll never be able to get that stupid charger thing out of there because you basically hold the wire in place with Legos or something underneath it.

1817
02:24:56,538 --> 02:24:56,779
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1818
02:24:57,540 --> 02:24:57,900
[SPEAKER_22]: Not fun.

1819
02:24:57,981 --> 02:24:59,062
[SPEAKER_02]: It's stuck in there pretty good.

1820
02:25:00,525 --> 02:25:00,966
[SPEAKER_22]: That's cool.

1821
02:25:00,986 --> 02:25:02,348
[SPEAKER_22]: I like that DS charging station.

1822
02:25:02,368 --> 02:25:02,869
[SPEAKER_22]: It was a good idea.

1823
02:25:03,422 --> 02:25:08,148
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll have to find, I have the specs on my computer still.

1824
02:25:08,849 --> 02:25:09,550
[SPEAKER_02]: Post those.

1825
02:25:10,271 --> 02:25:10,771
[SPEAKER_02]: It was fun.

1826
02:25:11,272 --> 02:25:11,652
[SPEAKER_21]: Good times.

1827
02:25:12,914 --> 02:25:20,664
[SPEAKER_22]: Alright, I think what we're going to do is we're going to go to a break and when we come back we might do some Ask Orange Lounge if the Skype line's not working.

1828
02:25:21,484 --> 02:25:25,726
[SPEAKER_22]: and some other stories, whatever tickles our fancy when we come back after this break.

1829
02:25:25,766 --> 02:25:29,668
[SPEAKER_22]: And in this break, more Bomani Potpourri, because we can.

1830
02:25:30,148 --> 02:25:32,710
[SPEAKER_22]: And we'll start it off with an old school Beatmania song.

1831
02:25:32,750 --> 02:25:34,611
[SPEAKER_22]: We're going to do Total Recall.

1832
02:25:35,471 --> 02:25:37,932
[SPEAKER_22]: We'll be back with more Orange Lounge Radio right after this.

1833
02:25:50,808 --> 02:25:52,110
Thank you for watching!

1834
02:26:22,967 --> 02:26:23,608
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, oh, oh

1835
02:27:03,804 --> 02:27:08,222
[SPEAKER_12]: Straight, Indie Record Store, I'm picking something up, I'm picking something more

1836
02:27:37,111 --> 02:27:38,653
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, I know that you'll be mine

1837
02:28:37,788 --> 02:28:39,129
Thank you for watching!

1838
02:29:33,238 --> 02:29:33,962
Thanks for watching!

1839
02:30:30,668 --> 02:30:32,178
[SPEAKER_14]: Let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go

1840
02:31:58,192 --> 02:32:04,375
[SPEAKER_22]: Gaming Radio, so uncensored that even Tom Brokaw could get a job with us.

1841
02:32:06,836 --> 02:32:08,197
[SPEAKER_13]: Orange Lounge Radio.

1842
02:32:10,938 --> 02:32:12,899
[SPEAKER_22]: Back, boys and girls, with more Orange Lounge Radio.

1843
02:32:14,140 --> 02:32:16,821
[SPEAKER_22]: And a broke-ass Skype line, so we have no callers tonight.

1844
02:32:17,967 --> 02:32:20,408
[SPEAKER_22]: God, thank God we didn't have any interviews or anything scheduled tonight.

1845
02:32:20,448 --> 02:32:20,928
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank God.

1846
02:32:21,908 --> 02:32:22,789
[SPEAKER_22]: We'd be really screwed.

1847
02:32:24,369 --> 02:32:30,131
[SPEAKER_22]: So, sorry guys, we can't get you guys in on the Skype line, so we're not going to be able to do some calls tonight.

1848
02:32:30,171 --> 02:32:33,952
[SPEAKER_22]: We'll try one more time before the end of the show, although I somehow highly doubt it's going to work.

1849
02:32:35,232 --> 02:32:37,833
[SPEAKER_22]: And apologize to those of you guys that were waiting to call in, but you know what?

1850
02:32:38,834 --> 02:32:39,434
[SPEAKER_22]: Shit happens.

1851
02:32:42,133 --> 02:32:47,775
[SPEAKER_22]: Of course, next week we'll be back with another episode of Orange Lounge Radio Live, and all of us will be here.

1852
02:32:48,075 --> 02:32:50,036
[SPEAKER_22]: Maybe we'll have some special guests next week, I don't know.

1853
02:32:50,616 --> 02:32:53,737
[SPEAKER_22]: We've got to talk some of our buddies into coming on over to the show.

1854
02:32:54,898 --> 02:32:59,259
[SPEAKER_22]: Don't forget, we also have other live programming on Orange Lounge Radio all week long.

1855
02:32:59,299 --> 02:33:05,481
[SPEAKER_22]: Monday nights, Extroverse Case of the Mondays, which airs at 7 o'clock.

1856
02:33:05,641 --> 02:33:05,882
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, 7.

1857
02:33:07,242 --> 02:33:08,303
[SPEAKER_22]: DarkSakura is with us with...

1858
02:33:33,926 --> 02:33:44,613
[SPEAKER_08]: I pump up the volume which I'm doing every other Tuesday until the end of the semester and then I'll be back on regularly it's a music request show, I play whatever just tune in

1859
02:33:46,109 --> 02:33:50,672
[SPEAKER_22]: Wednesday nights on the station, The Rob Roberts Show, which is also on at 7 o'clock Pacific Time.

1860
02:33:51,112 --> 02:33:55,695
[SPEAKER_22]: And same sort of deal, I do take requests, but that's not really the concept of my show.

1861
02:33:56,395 --> 02:33:57,596
[SPEAKER_22]: I just play whatever the hell I feel like.

1862
02:33:57,636 --> 02:33:59,017
[SPEAKER_22]: And I also talk about geek stuff.

1863
02:33:59,397 --> 02:34:02,879
[SPEAKER_22]: I find some geek articles on the web and kind of give you my opinion on them.

1864
02:34:02,919 --> 02:34:08,083
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm kind of like Rush Limbaugh in that way, except not a fat drug addict, basically.

1865
02:34:11,125 --> 02:34:15,310
[SPEAKER_22]: Also, on Orange Lounge Radio, we may have some new shows coming soon.

1866
02:34:15,330 --> 02:34:17,512
[SPEAKER_22]: We're looking at expanding the station in the future.

1867
02:34:17,712 --> 02:34:19,093
[SPEAKER_22]: May happen, may not, we don't know.

1868
02:34:19,534 --> 02:34:24,018
[SPEAKER_22]: Very likely, though, that you're going to see some exciting stuff in the future at Orange Lounge Radio.

1869
02:34:24,479 --> 02:34:25,079
[SPEAKER_22]: Stay tuned.

1870
02:34:25,480 --> 02:34:27,382
[SPEAKER_22]: But as you'll notice, we've got Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday.

1871
02:34:27,402 --> 02:34:31,806
[SPEAKER_22]: We've got a couple days we can do some other stuff with, so we will see what happens.

1872
02:34:32,567 --> 02:34:32,847
[SPEAKER_22]: Moving on.

1873
02:34:34,403 --> 02:34:36,086
[SPEAKER_22]: Shall we do some Ask Orange Lounge, boys and girls?

1874
02:34:36,586 --> 02:34:39,070
[SPEAKER_22]: Alright, I got the thumbs up from DarkSakura, so here we go!

1875
02:34:42,676 --> 02:34:44,919
[SPEAKER_22]: It helped to have the volume up when I bring in the theme music, huh?

1876
02:34:50,993 --> 02:34:53,876
[SPEAKER_22]: Let's ask Orange Lounge some stupid question.

1877
02:34:54,376 --> 02:34:57,699
[SPEAKER_22]: What will we find out this week on Orange Lounge Radio?

1878
02:34:58,380 --> 02:35:01,543
[SPEAKER_22]: Will we find out why this microphone is broken?

1879
02:35:01,743 --> 02:35:04,706
[SPEAKER_22]: Because I'm about to throw it through a window if it doesn't cooperate.

1880
02:35:04,726 --> 02:35:12,333
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, apparently all they heard was geek articles and then fat drug addict.

1881
02:35:13,999 --> 02:35:22,345
[SPEAKER_22]: No, what I said is geek articles, and I'm kind of like a one-man Rush Limbaugh, because I give my opinions on them, except I'm not a fat drug addict.

1882
02:35:22,765 --> 02:35:24,246
[SPEAKER_22]: That was the correct thing that I said.

1883
02:35:28,089 --> 02:35:31,571
[SPEAKER_22]: Sakurina wants to know, does Sky like Rizlem the remix?

1884
02:35:32,572 --> 02:35:35,454
[SPEAKER_22]: I believe that's a song in Night Style, right?

1885
02:35:36,850 --> 02:35:38,610
[SPEAKER_22]: That's over in the 9th style.

1886
02:35:38,751 --> 02:35:40,971
[SPEAKER_22]: Let me see if I can get a little clip here of the Rizlem remix.

1887
02:35:41,731 --> 02:35:43,712
[SPEAKER_22]: DarkSakura is over there in the corner gagging.

1888
02:35:44,072 --> 02:35:46,272
[SPEAKER_22]: I take it you do not like the Rizlem remix.

1889
02:35:46,432 --> 02:35:49,613
[SPEAKER_08]: It could just be a lung cookie, but it sort of made my stomach turn.

1890
02:35:50,833 --> 02:35:53,914
[SPEAKER_22]: Hold on, let me see if we can get a little clip here of the Rizlem remix.

1891
02:35:57,555 --> 02:35:59,055
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that crap.

1892
02:35:59,996 --> 02:36:02,236
[SPEAKER_02]: I like the part that doesn't have the singing in it.

1893
02:36:02,716 --> 02:36:03,556
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, this is cool.

1894
02:36:03,756 --> 02:36:05,177
[SPEAKER_02]: The thing where we get in the middle?

1895
02:36:07,737 --> 02:36:08,960
[SPEAKER_08]: I like the plot where it ends.

1896
02:36:10,382 --> 02:36:10,703
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

1897
02:36:10,783 --> 02:36:11,825
[SPEAKER_02]: I like that kind of stuff.

1898
02:36:12,627 --> 02:36:13,489
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just it doesn't work.

1899
02:36:14,611 --> 02:36:15,172
[SPEAKER_02]: It's okay.

1900
02:36:15,793 --> 02:36:16,214
[SPEAKER_22]: It's okay.

1901
02:36:18,462 --> 02:36:19,363
[SPEAKER_22]: I prefer the original.

1902
02:36:19,383 --> 02:36:20,484
[SPEAKER_22]: I definitely prefer the original.

1903
02:36:20,624 --> 02:36:21,164
[SPEAKER_22]: But it's okay.

1904
02:36:21,305 --> 02:36:21,805
[SPEAKER_22]: I don't hate it.

1905
02:36:21,845 --> 02:36:23,267
[SPEAKER_22]: I don't despise it like DarkSakura does.

1906
02:36:24,248 --> 02:36:25,589
[SPEAKER_02]: Still gotta work on the other remix.

1907
02:36:25,729 --> 02:36:26,750
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1908
02:36:27,011 --> 02:36:29,313
[SPEAKER_22]: Are you gonna tell us about the samples thing?

1909
02:36:29,413 --> 02:36:30,334
[SPEAKER_22]: You gotta tell us.

1910
02:36:30,354 --> 02:36:30,795
[SPEAKER_22]: Hold on.

1911
02:36:30,895 --> 02:36:32,877
[SPEAKER_22]: After Asporn's launch, we'll get into that.

1912
02:36:33,357 --> 02:36:40,585
[SPEAKER_22]: Does anyone know the approximate cost of a 2DX 9th style machine and if they are still in production?

1913
02:36:41,604 --> 02:36:44,126
[SPEAKER_08]: 2DX Red on eBay right now, it's in City of Industry, $5,100.

1914
02:37:02,438 --> 02:37:05,300
[SPEAKER_22]: So that's probably what you're looking at for a 9-star machine as well.

1915
02:37:05,360 --> 02:37:06,241
[SPEAKER_22]: It is not cheap.

1916
02:37:07,282 --> 02:37:10,944
[SPEAKER_22]: And Sakurina also wants to know how Xtifer knows how to pronounce 2DX when he doesn't even play it.

1917
02:37:11,405 --> 02:37:12,626
[SPEAKER_22]: Um, cause he's heard me say it.

1918
02:37:12,806 --> 02:37:18,050
[SPEAKER_22]: And he, you know, Miklatov spends the weekend here sometimes and we'll both be playing it and he's like, what's that?

1919
02:37:18,110 --> 02:37:19,131
[SPEAKER_22]: And we say, it's 2DX.

1920
02:37:19,511 --> 02:37:20,131
[SPEAKER_22]: So he knows it.

1921
02:37:20,512 --> 02:37:22,393
[SPEAKER_22]: Cause he's Tina, he just sucks at it.

1922
02:37:23,274 --> 02:37:23,874
[SPEAKER_08]: Just teasing.

1923
02:37:24,374 --> 02:37:28,417
[SPEAKER_08]: He is a pro at, uh, at Taiko No Tatooine.

1924
02:37:29,879 --> 02:37:31,660
[SPEAKER_22]: He's actually very good at Taiko No Tatooine.

1925
02:37:34,556 --> 02:37:35,317
[SPEAKER_22]: Uh, let's see, moving on.

1926
02:37:36,098 --> 02:37:38,900
[SPEAKER_22]: Tomo Kun wants to know, how about that show, The Boondocks?

1927
02:37:40,020 --> 02:37:40,961
[SPEAKER_22]: I've never seen this show.

1928
02:37:41,522 --> 02:37:44,224
[SPEAKER_08]: I remember reading the comics in my funny papers.

1929
02:37:45,805 --> 02:37:47,006
[SPEAKER_22]: Not interested in watching this show.

1930
02:37:47,026 --> 02:37:49,708
[SPEAKER_02]: There was a funny show I did hear about, and I want to see it.

1931
02:37:49,728 --> 02:37:51,869
[SPEAKER_02]: It's supposed to be late tonight is when it's on.

1932
02:37:52,230 --> 02:37:54,811
[SPEAKER_02]: MTV2, it's called Wondershosen.

1933
02:37:55,612 --> 02:37:58,174
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like an adult version of Sesame Street.

1934
02:37:59,301 --> 02:38:00,443
[SPEAKER_22]: That sounds awesome.

1935
02:38:00,743 --> 02:38:01,284
[SPEAKER_02]: MTV2.

1936
02:38:01,945 --> 02:38:03,127
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm gonna have to... It's late at night.

1937
02:38:03,748 --> 02:38:05,491
[SPEAKER_22]: Are Bert and Ernie really gay in this one?

1938
02:38:05,852 --> 02:38:09,618
[SPEAKER_02]: No, they have, like, different characters, but they have one, it's, uh, what is it, um...

1939
02:38:11,284 --> 02:38:16,767
[SPEAKER_02]: D-O-G-Y-N is one of the, you know, like, dog OBGYNs.

1940
02:38:16,967 --> 02:38:19,908
[SPEAKER_02]: And then they also have, like, some weird ones.

1941
02:38:20,088 --> 02:38:24,270
[SPEAKER_02]: There's one, like, they were talking about the letter N, and nobody liked the letter N, so N left.

1942
02:38:24,550 --> 02:38:33,795
[SPEAKER_02]: Then they had to find the letter S with the track down the letter N, and instead of tracking N down, ended up having sex with N and had babies and stuff.

1943
02:38:34,275 --> 02:38:36,577
[SPEAKER_02]: Who is your favorite character in the Super Mario Bros.

1944
02:38:36,597 --> 02:38:36,837
[SPEAKER_02]: series?

1945
02:39:07,588 --> 02:39:09,370
[SPEAKER_22]: Who's your favorite character in the Super Mario Bros.

1946
02:39:09,410 --> 02:39:09,710
[SPEAKER_22]: series?

1947
02:39:12,132 --> 02:39:15,795
[SPEAKER_22]: Um... I really don't know.

1948
02:39:17,517 --> 02:39:19,839
[SPEAKER_22]: I'd say Princess Peach, because Peach is the winner!

1949
02:39:20,039 --> 02:39:21,861
[SPEAKER_22]: She's such an arrogant little fuck, I like her.

1950
02:39:22,801 --> 02:39:23,302
[SPEAKER_22]: Big Boo!

1951
02:39:24,062 --> 02:39:24,543
[SPEAKER_22]: Big Boo!

1952
02:39:24,803 --> 02:39:25,264
[SPEAKER_22]: Big Boo!

1953
02:39:25,524 --> 02:39:26,545
[SPEAKER_22]: Big Boo's pretty awesome.

1954
02:39:26,905 --> 02:39:27,345
[SPEAKER_22]: You, Loki?

1955
02:39:27,886 --> 02:39:28,286
[SPEAKER_02]: Geno.

1956
02:39:29,307 --> 02:39:29,527
[SPEAKER_22]: Who?

1957
02:39:29,888 --> 02:39:30,268
[SPEAKER_02]: Geno.

1958
02:39:30,388 --> 02:39:31,909
[SPEAKER_02]: He's from Super Mario RPG.

1959
02:39:32,550 --> 02:39:33,150
[SPEAKER_20]: Oh, God.

1960
02:39:33,651 --> 02:39:34,672
[SPEAKER_20]: Wow, that's obscure.

1961
02:39:37,883 --> 02:39:38,623
[SPEAKER_20]: More questions.

1962
02:39:42,126 --> 02:39:44,828
[SPEAKER_20]: Rimi asks the following.

1963
02:39:44,868 --> 02:39:45,989
[SPEAKER_20]: Consider the following.

1964
02:39:46,929 --> 02:39:52,053
[SPEAKER_22]: Medical science advances to the point where a device can seal wounds on the spot.

1965
02:39:52,594 --> 02:39:53,134
[SPEAKER_22]: Problem.

1966
02:39:53,615 --> 02:39:59,179
[SPEAKER_22]: Your friends use said technology to seal your ass shut as a practical joke.

1967
02:39:59,819 --> 02:40:00,380
[SPEAKER_22]: What do you do?

1968
02:40:00,920 --> 02:40:01,881
[SPEAKER_02]: Go on, jackass.

1969
02:40:05,383 --> 02:40:06,004
[SPEAKER_02]: Viva la banja.

1970
02:40:06,277 --> 02:40:06,937
[SPEAKER_22]: Fart it open.

1971
02:40:07,338 --> 02:40:10,619
[SPEAKER_22]: I think you would die because your colon would explode.

1972
02:40:11,040 --> 02:40:11,780
[SPEAKER_22]: Fart it open!

1973
02:40:12,140 --> 02:40:15,342
[SPEAKER_02]: Or you would go to the hospital and, I don't know, have them cut it open.

1974
02:40:15,402 --> 02:40:21,505
[SPEAKER_22]: You know, yeah, I would think if the medical science is far enough along where they could seal your ass shut magically, they could unseal it magically.

1975
02:40:22,266 --> 02:40:23,826
[SPEAKER_02]: If it ain't broken, they can't fix it.

1976
02:40:26,908 --> 02:40:29,449
[SPEAKER_22]: And what are some pretty underrated songs on DDR?

1977
02:40:29,529 --> 02:40:30,410
[SPEAKER_22]: Oh, a real question.

1978
02:40:30,450 --> 02:40:31,010
[SPEAKER_22]: That's good to know.

1979
02:40:31,410 --> 02:40:33,852
[SPEAKER_22]: What are some pretty underrated songs on DDR?

1980
02:40:35,580 --> 02:40:36,080
[SPEAKER_22]: Moving on.

1981
02:40:36,501 --> 02:40:37,582
[SPEAKER_08]: Someone's knocking on the door.

1982
02:40:37,842 --> 02:40:38,262
[SPEAKER_22]: No, that's me.

1983
02:40:38,362 --> 02:40:39,383
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm tapping on the table.

1984
02:40:40,344 --> 02:40:41,705
[SPEAKER_22]: Moving on from DDR5thMix.

1985
02:40:43,086 --> 02:40:44,106
[SPEAKER_22]: I like that song.

1986
02:40:44,126 --> 02:40:44,987
[SPEAKER_22]: That's a cool song.

1987
02:40:45,087 --> 02:40:45,447
[SPEAKER_22]: What else?

1988
02:40:45,628 --> 02:40:47,869
[SPEAKER_22]: Can you think of anything, DarkSakura?

1989
02:40:49,630 --> 02:40:51,092
[SPEAKER_22]: Underrated songs in DDR.

1990
02:40:52,132 --> 02:40:55,935
[SPEAKER_08]: That's really easy because I always said Love That Feeling was underrated.

1991
02:40:56,516 --> 02:40:58,037
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, because a lot of people hate on Love That Feeling.

1992
02:40:58,777 --> 02:40:59,057
[SPEAKER_22]: Bass.

1993
02:41:00,218 --> 02:41:01,119
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, that's a good one.

1994
02:41:01,940 --> 02:41:04,321
[SPEAKER_22]: God, most of the songs I like, a lot of people...

1995
02:41:05,919 --> 02:41:07,640
[SPEAKER_22]: Xanadu Night in Motion Kongafelin

1996
02:41:33,755 --> 02:41:35,635
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm trying to think of some of the more recent mixes.

1997
02:41:35,675 --> 02:41:40,757
[SPEAKER_02]: Fantasy from Extreme 2.

1998
02:41:40,797 --> 02:41:43,397
[SPEAKER_22]: No, Fantasy was in Max 1.

1999
02:41:43,457 --> 02:41:45,698
[SPEAKER_22]: It was in Max 1 and then didn't come back for Max 2.

2000
02:41:47,158 --> 02:41:47,478
[SPEAKER_22]: That one?

2001
02:41:47,898 --> 02:41:49,299
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

2002
02:41:49,419 --> 02:41:49,719
[SPEAKER_22]: Is that it?

2003
02:41:49,739 --> 02:41:50,479
[SPEAKER_02]: That's Max 2.

2004
02:41:50,679 --> 02:41:52,719
[SPEAKER_02]: Fantasy was the one that was Eurobeat from Max 1.

2005
02:41:53,160 --> 02:41:54,060
[SPEAKER_22]: Oh, Fantasy.

2006
02:41:55,020 --> 02:41:58,441
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that one needs to go away, but the other one, that one's pretty good.

2007
02:41:58,541 --> 02:41:59,101
[SPEAKER_22]: That is a good one.

2008
02:42:02,148 --> 02:42:02,948
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm trying to think of U.S.

2009
02:42:03,468 --> 02:42:04,409
[SPEAKER_22]: Also, there's U.S.

2010
02:42:04,489 --> 02:42:06,589
[SPEAKER_22]: licenses that I think are incredibly underrated.

2011
02:42:07,070 --> 02:42:14,332
[SPEAKER_22]: I don't think the PlayStation 2 fanboys need to recognize that Xbox has some really good songs on Ultramix 2, such as Skulk.

2012
02:42:15,472 --> 02:42:18,993
[SPEAKER_22]: But I don't know if I would call that underrated, because anyone that's played it knows it's awesome.

2013
02:42:19,614 --> 02:42:20,574
[SPEAKER_22]: But I'm trying to think of other U.S.

2014
02:42:20,634 --> 02:42:22,214
[SPEAKER_22]: licenses that I think are a little bit underrated.

2015
02:42:22,755 --> 02:42:27,276
[SPEAKER_22]: I always liked Dark Black Forest, and I know a lot of people hated it on that song, but I thought it was a great song.

2016
02:42:27,316 --> 02:42:29,097
[SPEAKER_22]: Just a very random choice for DDR.

2017
02:42:29,117 --> 02:42:29,737
[SPEAKER_22]: I thought it was great.

2018
02:42:30,727 --> 02:42:32,368
[SPEAKER_02]: and what was the other one?

2019
02:42:32,388 --> 02:42:33,649
[SPEAKER_02]: There's another one that was really good.

2020
02:42:33,709 --> 02:42:34,750
[SPEAKER_02]: That was also O.M.

2021
02:42:35,410 --> 02:42:36,491
[SPEAKER_02]: Max.

2022
02:42:37,451 --> 02:42:37,812
[SPEAKER_21]: Max USA?

2023
02:42:37,832 --> 02:42:38,052
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah.

2024
02:42:38,072 --> 02:42:42,855
[SPEAKER_21]: The Take It To The Morning... Yeah.

2025
02:42:42,955 --> 02:42:43,395
[SPEAKER_04]: I like that one.

2026
02:42:43,415 --> 02:42:43,835
[SPEAKER_21]: That one, yeah.

2027
02:42:43,995 --> 02:42:44,636
[SPEAKER_21]: I like that song, too.

2028
02:42:47,858 --> 02:42:49,119
[SPEAKER_22]: How about a question from me?

2029
02:42:49,179 --> 02:42:53,942
[SPEAKER_22]: Because I see our chat room is suddenly singing, My humps, my humps, what would you do if they put my humps in DDR?

2030
02:42:53,962 --> 02:42:55,703
[SPEAKER_22]: Because Loki hates that song, by the way.

2031
02:42:55,723 --> 02:42:55,783
[SPEAKER_22]: Bye.

2032
02:42:57,308 --> 02:43:06,517
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I would say that's pretty bad, but thank God it hasn't been put in, and I would have to show my fiancé and she'd have to laugh at me.

2033
02:43:06,857 --> 02:43:10,040
[SPEAKER_22]: I actually like Hey Mama a lot in Ultramix 3, though.

2034
02:43:10,080 --> 02:43:11,201
[SPEAKER_22]: I gotta say, that was a good choice.

2035
02:43:11,301 --> 02:43:12,822
[SPEAKER_22]: For a Black Eyed Peas song, that was a really good choice.

2036
02:43:12,842 --> 02:43:15,205
[SPEAKER_22]: This is it.

2037
02:43:17,950 --> 02:43:18,350
[SPEAKER_08]: Black Eyed Peas

2038
02:43:48,070 --> 02:43:48,711
I have heard this song.

2039
02:43:48,791 --> 02:43:49,691
I heard it in spin.

2040
02:43:49,731 --> 02:43:49,971
See?

2041
02:43:49,991 --> 02:43:52,493
[SPEAKER_08]: I heard it in spin and I remember hating it.

2042
02:43:52,513 --> 02:43:53,133
[SPEAKER_08]: Black Eyed Peas?

2043
02:43:53,153 --> 02:43:53,314
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

2044
02:43:53,354 --> 02:43:56,055
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, in the Best Buy commercial, the, you know, remix!

2045
02:43:56,095 --> 02:43:56,516
Yeah, I know.

2046
02:43:56,576 --> 02:43:58,537
[SPEAKER_16]: I friggin' hate this microphone.

2047
02:43:58,617 --> 02:43:59,418
[SPEAKER_22]: I hate this microphone.

2048
02:43:59,438 --> 02:44:00,098
[SPEAKER_02]: Black Eyed Peas are okay.

2049
02:44:14,504 --> 02:44:19,026
[SPEAKER_22]: Xander C wants to know, do I suck at DDR if I can't beat Max Unlimited on Heavy?

2050
02:44:19,407 --> 02:44:23,369
[SPEAKER_22]: And is it weird that I can't beat that but manage to beat Charlene in the group of an expert?

2051
02:44:24,149 --> 02:44:25,470
[SPEAKER_22]: I can't beat Max Unlimited on Heavy.

2052
02:44:25,890 --> 02:44:32,073
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, I used to play doubles and I would play some crazy shit in doubles and I still couldn't beat it.

2053
02:44:32,113 --> 02:44:32,993
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just too fast.

2054
02:44:33,593 --> 02:44:35,534
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not really a song that should be played.

2055
02:44:35,574 --> 02:44:38,956
[SPEAKER_02]: They just made it really super hard and ooh, I did it.

2056
02:44:39,096 --> 02:44:40,577
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's not a song to be played for fun.

2057
02:44:41,657 --> 02:44:42,798
[SPEAKER_22]: And I don't think it's odd that you

2058
02:44:47,040 --> 02:44:58,427
[SPEAKER_22]: I don't think it's odd that you can't beat that, but you can beat Charlene, because I remember, I think it was Charlene, I might be mixing it up with one of the erotic songs, but I think maybe I'm wrong.

2059
02:45:00,652 --> 02:45:08,674
[SPEAKER_22]: I might be mixing up Charlene with Lemmings on the run, but I remember that one of them on heavy had an awful lot of freezes, was like the big thing, was there was a lot of freezes in the hands.

2060
02:45:09,194 --> 02:45:19,316
[SPEAKER_22]: And if I could do hands, unfortunately I'm very tall and my back will go out very easily if I do too much of the hands thing, which is one of the reasons I don't like in the groove because I hate the hands thing.

2061
02:45:19,996 --> 02:45:22,657
[SPEAKER_22]: I could almost beat it, though, if it weren't for that.

2062
02:45:23,197 --> 02:45:28,720
[SPEAKER_22]: I don't remember if it was that or Charlene that I was very close to beating, but yet I haven't come close to beating Max Unlimited.

2063
02:45:29,000 --> 02:45:30,240
[SPEAKER_22]: And I have no problem sharing that.

2064
02:45:30,341 --> 02:45:34,823
[SPEAKER_22]: I don't think you have to necessarily be the bestest DDR player in the world.

2065
02:45:34,883 --> 02:45:35,703
[SPEAKER_22]: I mean, who cares?

2066
02:45:36,203 --> 02:45:37,264
[SPEAKER_22]: You play it because it's fun.

2067
02:45:37,284 --> 02:45:38,024
[SPEAKER_22]: That's why I play it.

2068
02:45:38,264 --> 02:45:43,507
[SPEAKER_22]: That's why I don't mind when they release a new mix of DDR and there's only one 10-footer in it and a bunch of 7s.

2069
02:45:43,667 --> 02:45:49,010
[SPEAKER_22]: I like the game better that way because DDR for me is more of a casual workout type thing and not a...

2070
02:45:50,250 --> 02:45:55,591
[SPEAKER_22]: I want to wheeze and throw up, you know, lung chunks after, no offense, lung chunks after one song.

2071
02:45:55,651 --> 02:45:58,092
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey, I know all about throwing up lung chunks.

2072
02:45:58,472 --> 02:45:58,732
[SPEAKER_22]: Sorry?

2073
02:45:59,012 --> 02:46:00,392
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to get back to the wheezing part.

2074
02:46:00,433 --> 02:46:01,433
[SPEAKER_02]: That's fun.

2075
02:46:02,593 --> 02:46:08,814
[SPEAKER_22]: Well, the sad thing is I probably wouldn't even be able to beat, like, Breakdown or Stay on Heavy, and I used to be able to do those, no problem.

2076
02:46:08,895 --> 02:46:09,515
[SPEAKER_22]: I beat Breakdown.

2077
02:46:10,035 --> 02:46:10,855
[SPEAKER_22]: I probably couldn't do it.

2078
02:46:11,638 --> 02:46:17,907
[SPEAKER_02]: Having a fiance really cuts into the 8 hour sessions of DDR that I used to do in arcade.

2079
02:46:17,967 --> 02:46:19,729
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just... I can't do it anymore.

2080
02:46:23,034 --> 02:46:27,160
[SPEAKER_22]: Oh, it's Queen of Light that's the freezes in hands and Charlene is just a lot of runs.

2081
02:46:28,121 --> 02:46:29,362
[SPEAKER_02]: Legend of Zaku wants to say...

2082
02:46:56,440 --> 02:46:59,201
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm in the market for some good-ass sake.

2083
02:46:59,521 --> 02:47:00,361
[SPEAKER_22]: Any suggestions?

2084
02:47:00,522 --> 02:47:03,202
[SPEAKER_22]: I've never had sake in my life, believe it or not, so I can't help you.

2085
02:47:03,603 --> 02:47:08,524
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a brand I like, but for the life of me, I can't remember how to pronounce the name, so give me a sec, I'll look for it.

2086
02:47:08,845 --> 02:47:09,725
[SPEAKER_22]: Okay, uh, Loki?

2087
02:47:09,745 --> 02:47:11,105
[SPEAKER_22]: I don't drink sake.

2088
02:47:11,165 --> 02:47:11,345
[SPEAKER_08]: Any sake?

2089
02:47:11,385 --> 02:47:12,146
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, I don't drink it either.

2090
02:47:12,306 --> 02:47:13,746
[SPEAKER_22]: What's a plum wine that you usually get?

2091
02:47:13,786 --> 02:47:16,747
[SPEAKER_22]: I know that's not sake, but speaking of, like, you know, Asian liquor, what was that?

2092
02:47:17,127 --> 02:47:17,548
[SPEAKER_22]: That was good.

2093
02:47:19,068 --> 02:47:20,009
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh, shoot.

2094
02:47:21,529 --> 02:47:23,490
[SPEAKER_08]: The cheap stuff I buy is the Takara brand.

2095
02:47:23,770 --> 02:47:23,950
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

2096
02:47:25,026 --> 02:47:27,869
[SPEAKER_22]: Alright, let's check out the, uh, uh, sake thing.

2097
02:47:28,169 --> 02:47:30,692
[SPEAKER_02]: He basically all actually has his own energy drink.

2098
02:47:30,932 --> 02:47:32,493
[SPEAKER_02]: Just some random trivia thrown in there.

2099
02:47:33,877 --> 02:47:42,859
[SPEAKER_22]: Legend of Zaku wants to know, I wonder if you t-voted last week's episodes of Direct Effect in which yours truly was seen as well as New York City's best DDR player being profiled.

2100
02:47:43,939 --> 02:47:45,319
[SPEAKER_22]: I forgot to set the t-vote.

2101
02:47:45,379 --> 02:47:47,439
[SPEAKER_22]: And I had it on there and everything, I forgot to do it.

2102
02:47:47,879 --> 02:47:49,260
[SPEAKER_22]: But I know they're going to rerun it to death.

2103
02:47:49,300 --> 02:47:50,860
[SPEAKER_22]: It'll be on again, so I'm not too worried.

2104
02:47:51,420 --> 02:47:53,701
[SPEAKER_22]: And I'm sure Zaku will tell me when it's being rerun.

2105
02:47:53,721 --> 02:47:56,681
[SPEAKER_08]: Here's a good brand for the plum wine.

2106
02:47:58,181 --> 02:47:59,822
[SPEAKER_08]: It's got the green plums at the bottom.

2107
02:48:00,222 --> 02:48:01,222
[SPEAKER_22]: Ah, yes, I remember that.

2108
02:48:03,202 --> 02:48:06,163
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes, you bought that once and we got drunk off that shit.

2109
02:48:06,223 --> 02:48:08,943
[SPEAKER_08]: And you can't tell because it doesn't taste like booze.

2110
02:48:09,223 --> 02:48:11,844
[SPEAKER_22]: One of the first times me and you got drunk together was off that stuff.

2111
02:48:11,864 --> 02:48:12,404
[SPEAKER_22]: Off that stuff.

2112
02:48:12,964 --> 02:48:16,085
[SPEAKER_22]: So now look up that sake and let us know.

2113
02:48:17,805 --> 02:48:18,685
[SPEAKER_22]: Meanwhile, more questions.

2114
02:48:18,705 --> 02:48:20,486
[SPEAKER_22]: We're doing Ask Orange Lounge here on Orange Lounge Radio.

2115
02:48:20,506 --> 02:48:25,487
[SPEAKER_22]: If you're just joining us, this is a portion of the show where the listeners can submit questions to us and we answer them because we love our listeners.

2116
02:48:25,507 --> 02:48:26,107
[SPEAKER_02]: You're just joining us.

2117
02:48:26,127 --> 02:48:27,127
[SPEAKER_02]: You're a bit late, too.

2118
02:48:35,062 --> 02:48:43,910
[SPEAKER_22]: I want to learn Japanese, but I'm poor, so I can't pay anything, and there's nothing or anyone near me that could teach it to me for free.

2119
02:48:44,410 --> 02:48:47,233
[SPEAKER_22]: Anything good and free on the internet, I'm out of ideas.

2120
02:48:47,693 --> 02:48:55,300
[SPEAKER_22]: I have a suggestion, try out podcasts, because there's actually a lot of podcasts out there that try to teach you how to speak a second language, not just Spanish, but I'm sure there's a Japanese one out there too.

2121
02:48:56,060 --> 02:48:57,301
[SPEAKER_22]: A lot of good free stuff.

2122
02:48:57,581 --> 02:49:00,682
[SPEAKER_22]: I don't know if you can find anything at an elementary level, but you never know.

2123
02:49:01,362 --> 02:49:12,926
[SPEAKER_22]: Also, sometimes if you look on some of the sites such as BitTorrent stuff, you can sometimes find and learn how to speak Japanese CD, which, you know, it's better than nothing.

2124
02:49:13,186 --> 02:49:13,846
[SPEAKER_22]: Go to college.

2125
02:49:14,906 --> 02:49:15,727
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, or go to college.

2126
02:49:16,007 --> 02:49:16,327
[SPEAKER_02]: Or if you...

2127
02:49:16,727 --> 02:49:18,368
[SPEAKER_02]: BOOM BOOM Satellites BOOM BOOM Satellites

2128
02:49:43,410 --> 02:49:47,951
[SPEAKER_22]: NintendoManiac64 says, did anyone make a YTMND out of your I Like Big Dick quote yet?

2129
02:49:48,551 --> 02:49:49,671
[SPEAKER_22]: No, they haven't, and I hope they don't.

2130
02:49:51,172 --> 02:49:54,773
[SPEAKER_22]: Also wants to know, how was my Firefox Mario Kart DS decal?

2131
02:49:56,273 --> 02:49:56,813
[SPEAKER_22]: It was cool.

2132
02:49:56,873 --> 02:50:03,774
[SPEAKER_22]: I imagine you probably used that same thing that a lot of people use to turn a graphic into an emblem.

2133
02:50:04,075 --> 02:50:05,635
[SPEAKER_22]: But what I want to know is, what was that thing...

2134
02:50:06,315 --> 02:50:21,465
[SPEAKER_22]: Where you were going back and forth, because I remember playing you, you were going back and forth on the track a lot, like, I don't know if you were trying to do like a bunch of drifts, but you were going really fast, and I know you weren't getting that many mushrooms, so, I don't know, were you trying to do a bunch of drifts or something?

2135
02:50:21,585 --> 02:50:22,045
[SPEAKER_22]: Snaking?

2136
02:50:22,345 --> 02:50:23,506
[SPEAKER_22]: Snaking, what the hell is this?

2137
02:50:23,666 --> 02:50:31,908
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, the things I've seen people doing wasn't snaking, because it looks like they're spasming on the track.

2138
02:50:32,248 --> 02:50:39,550
[SPEAKER_02]: I understand what snaking is, where you drift back and forth really quick to do the little boost so you go faster that way.

2139
02:50:39,810 --> 02:50:41,951
[SPEAKER_02]: It's hard to do, you have to have the right cart for it, but...

2140
02:50:42,831 --> 02:51:05,270
[SPEAKER_02]: You can do it, but the thing is, they used to do that actually in, remember back in F-Zero GX, except that was done differently, that was with the break boosting or whatever, and you can do that with Mario Kart Double Dash, you can do it with the drifts the same way, but this is something different though, and I don't know why, because when I've seen these players...

2141
02:51:05,490 --> 02:51:06,171
[SPEAKER_02]: Is anyone there really gay?

2142
02:51:06,211 --> 02:51:08,913
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm ignorant and gullible so I usually can't tell if you guys are joking or not

2143
02:51:21,445 --> 02:51:27,087
[SPEAKER_22]: DarkSakura has a husband, so obviously she is, you know, dansexual, I believe, as she calls it.

2144
02:51:27,287 --> 02:51:27,947
[SPEAKER_22]: Dansexual.

2145
02:51:28,887 --> 02:51:33,429
[SPEAKER_22]: Loki has a fiancé and does not like any of the cock, as far as I know.

2146
02:51:34,009 --> 02:51:35,109
[SPEAKER_22]: Not that he has a problem with that.

2147
02:51:36,130 --> 02:51:37,350
[SPEAKER_22]: He's completely straight, yes?

2148
02:51:38,130 --> 02:51:38,310
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes.

2149
02:51:38,730 --> 02:51:39,571
[SPEAKER_22]: I am gay.

2150
02:51:39,751 --> 02:51:42,131
[SPEAKER_22]: I am literally gay, and it's fine.

2151
02:51:43,252 --> 02:51:43,932
[SPEAKER_22]: It's not a joke.

2152
02:51:44,052 --> 02:51:49,634
[SPEAKER_22]: We joke about it because, you know, it's kind of like how, you know, gay people can call each other fag and that's okay.

2153
02:51:51,374 --> 02:51:53,155
[SPEAKER_22]: Just like how black people always call... Never mind.

2154
02:51:54,216 --> 02:51:54,516
[SPEAKER_22]: Forget it.

2155
02:51:55,457 --> 02:51:56,778
[SPEAKER_22]: But, you know.

2156
02:51:57,878 --> 02:52:00,260
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes, I'm gay and so is Xtifer, but we are not together.

2157
02:52:00,280 --> 02:52:06,003
[SPEAKER_22]: That's a very common misconception I think people think because Xtifer and I live together and we're both gay, we must be fucking, but that's not true.

2158
02:52:06,924 --> 02:52:09,365
[SPEAKER_22]: No, Xtifer and I are just buds, we're like brothers, nothing like that.

2159
02:52:10,486 --> 02:52:16,329
[SPEAKER_22]: However, I date, I've been seeing someone, and I've kind of brought that up a couple times on the show, but...

2160
02:52:17,730 --> 02:52:22,955
[SPEAKER_22]: I don't think he'd be used to the idea of me talking about him on the air yet, and he could be listening, so I don't say a whole lot about it.

2161
02:52:23,295 --> 02:52:23,795
[SPEAKER_22]: But he's cool.

2162
02:52:23,855 --> 02:52:24,816
[SPEAKER_22]: He's a gamer, too.

2163
02:52:25,217 --> 02:52:27,739
[SPEAKER_22]: He plays Mario Kart DS with me, so he rocks.

2164
02:52:30,641 --> 02:52:30,961
[SPEAKER_22]: Who else?

2165
02:52:31,542 --> 02:52:32,923
[SPEAKER_08]: I think he's cute, too.

2166
02:52:34,284 --> 02:52:34,624
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you.

2167
02:52:35,245 --> 02:52:35,705
[SPEAKER_22]: He is cute.

2168
02:52:35,725 --> 02:52:36,166
[SPEAKER_22]: He is a cutie.

2169
02:52:36,866 --> 02:52:38,367
[SPEAKER_22]: A little quiet sometimes, but a cutie, I like him.

2170
02:52:38,467 --> 02:52:40,909
[SPEAKER_08]: Even though the one time I met him, I was highly intoxicated.

2171
02:52:40,929 --> 02:52:42,810
[SPEAKER_22]: You were very intoxicated, but he's a nice guy.

2172
02:52:44,992 --> 02:52:47,854
[SPEAKER_22]: And I don't think Miklatov would mind me sharing that he's gay, too.

2173
02:52:48,254 --> 02:52:49,815
[SPEAKER_22]: And that's cool.

2174
02:52:50,476 --> 02:52:52,097
[SPEAKER_22]: So, yes, there are really gay people that do this.

2175
02:52:52,277 --> 02:52:57,701
[SPEAKER_22]: But we don't talk a whole lot about... Well, we do talk about the sexuality thing, and I think it might be hard to tell that we're joking sometimes.

2176
02:52:58,081 --> 02:52:59,542
[SPEAKER_22]: DarkSakura.com

2177
02:53:24,598 --> 02:53:28,121
[SPEAKER_22]: Not just her, but other girl presenters on podcasts, game podcasts, get targeted.

2178
02:53:28,402 --> 02:53:28,682
[SPEAKER_22]: They do.

2179
02:53:29,102 --> 02:53:31,804
[SPEAKER_22]: Because some guys don't know how to deal with that.

2180
02:53:31,824 --> 02:53:32,305
[SPEAKER_22]: I don't know what it is.

2181
02:53:32,325 --> 02:53:33,566
[SPEAKER_22]: They assume that she's a giggling girl.

2182
02:53:33,986 --> 02:53:38,250
[SPEAKER_22]: To quote one site, put down the controller and get back in the kitchen.

2183
02:53:38,450 --> 02:53:39,511
[SPEAKER_08]: Excuse me, fuck you.

2184
02:53:39,531 --> 02:53:41,813
[SPEAKER_08]: See, that's just stupid.

2185
02:53:43,895 --> 02:53:45,096
[SPEAKER_22]: Um, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

2186
02:53:47,090 --> 02:53:50,651
[SPEAKER_22]: Um, okay, he's got too many questions, so I'm jumping right to his last question.

2187
02:53:50,711 --> 02:53:52,652
[SPEAKER_22]: Why did you say I used the decal generator?

2188
02:53:52,812 --> 02:53:54,733
[SPEAKER_22]: I made my Firefox decal myself.

2189
02:53:54,773 --> 02:53:55,313
[SPEAKER_22]: Took two hours.

2190
02:53:55,993 --> 02:53:56,674
[SPEAKER_22]: Good for you.

2191
02:53:56,954 --> 02:53:58,674
[SPEAKER_22]: Sorry, I made an assumption.

2192
02:53:59,054 --> 02:53:59,495
[SPEAKER_22]: Shoot me.

2193
02:54:04,096 --> 02:54:05,517
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to make a penis decal.

2194
02:54:05,537 --> 02:54:10,899
[SPEAKER_08]: I have to play the game just to do that.

2195
02:54:13,903 --> 02:54:15,124
[SPEAKER_22]: I like in our chat room there.

2196
02:54:15,444 --> 02:54:22,466
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm just now reading all the chat room is that everybody is like gasping and saying that they're so surprised at the fact that I'm gay.

2197
02:54:22,926 --> 02:54:25,667
[SPEAKER_22]: And Zaku says that Sky can't say nigga.

2198
02:54:25,967 --> 02:54:26,647
[SPEAKER_22]: Oh, crap.

2199
02:54:26,907 --> 02:54:27,387
[SPEAKER_22]: Oh, crap.

2200
02:54:27,587 --> 02:54:28,207
[SPEAKER_22]: I just saw him.

2201
02:54:28,448 --> 02:54:29,368
[SPEAKER_22]: Man, I screwed up.

2202
02:54:31,969 --> 02:54:34,869
[SPEAKER_22]: And then, of course, my favorite term ever, gamer.

2203
02:54:35,130 --> 02:54:38,230
[SPEAKER_22]: Color of Sakura says I'm a gamer with a G-A-Y capital.

2204
02:54:38,250 --> 02:54:38,871
[SPEAKER_22]: Get it, gamer?

2205
02:54:39,751 --> 02:54:40,051
[SPEAKER_22]: Love it.

2206
02:54:44,786 --> 02:54:45,207
[SPEAKER_22]: Moving on.

2207
02:54:45,867 --> 02:54:50,388
[SPEAKER_22]: Color of Sakura wants to know, any suggestions on what 2DX song track I should buy?

2208
02:54:50,768 --> 02:54:53,668
[SPEAKER_22]: I have 2DX Red and Happy Sky, so other than those two.

2209
02:54:55,649 --> 02:54:57,769
[SPEAKER_22]: I love, love, love Fifth Style.

2210
02:54:58,969 --> 02:55:00,270
[SPEAKER_22]: I love Fifth Style's soundtrack.

2211
02:55:00,750 --> 02:55:01,550
[SPEAKER_22]: So I suggest that.

2212
02:55:01,570 --> 02:55:03,210
[SPEAKER_22]: If you're going to go old school, go for Fifth Style.

2213
02:55:03,550 --> 02:55:04,990
[SPEAKER_22]: I used to wake up to that every morning.

2214
02:55:05,771 --> 02:55:05,991
[SPEAKER_22]: Eight.

2215
02:55:07,011 --> 02:55:07,471
[SPEAKER_21]: There you have it.

2216
02:55:09,634 --> 02:55:14,578
[SPEAKER_22]: NeoDude0 says, what good dance pads are there besides Red Octane that don't cost $500?

2217
02:55:14,898 --> 02:55:18,080
[SPEAKER_22]: There's the kind you build yourself.

2218
02:55:18,941 --> 02:55:24,625
[SPEAKER_22]: There's the one that DDR Game puts out, but I'm going to be honest, we played it at E3, not impressed by their product.

2219
02:55:24,885 --> 02:55:25,706
[SPEAKER_22]: And it injured.

2220
02:55:27,227 --> 02:55:28,287
[SPEAKER_22]: That's right, I remember that.

2221
02:55:28,788 --> 02:55:36,693
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, so honestly, I suppose if you want something that is cheap and effective and you don't play a lot of katas, just go for the $20 Madcatz ones.

2222
02:55:37,874 --> 02:55:42,716
[SPEAKER_22]: I know a lot of people knock on the Mad Catz ones, but honestly, for the casual DDR player, it'll work.

2223
02:55:42,936 --> 02:55:43,556
[SPEAKER_22]: It'll get you through the day.

2224
02:55:43,576 --> 02:55:50,959
[SPEAKER_02]: Or if you take a softpad and you mount it on a wood, and you do the... That's a good idea, too.

2225
02:55:51,019 --> 02:55:55,221
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, just basically mounting something on a board makes a softpad even better.

2226
02:55:55,781 --> 02:55:59,142
[SPEAKER_22]: I don't know if she came up again here, but she used to have that at her old apartment.

2227
02:55:59,162 --> 02:56:00,443
[SPEAKER_22]: They worked very, very well.

2228
02:56:00,783 --> 02:56:03,106
[SPEAKER_08]: I was the first 9-footer I ever passed was on those.

2229
02:56:03,627 --> 02:56:04,308
[SPEAKER_22]: Me too, I think.

2230
02:56:04,428 --> 02:56:05,609
[SPEAKER_22]: No, second 9-footer I ever did was on those.

2231
02:56:05,629 --> 02:56:08,192
[SPEAKER_08]: Because I passed Electro-Tuned.

2232
02:56:08,473 --> 02:56:10,795
[SPEAKER_08]: That's right.

2233
02:56:11,656 --> 02:56:12,938
[SPEAKER_08]: No, it wasn't Electro-Tuned.

2234
02:56:13,018 --> 02:56:14,660
[SPEAKER_08]: It was Lupin.

2235
02:56:14,700 --> 02:56:15,621
[SPEAKER_20]: Hypnotic Crisis?

2236
02:56:16,102 --> 02:56:16,663
[SPEAKER_08]: It was Lupin.

2237
02:56:16,683 --> 02:56:16,963
[SPEAKER_08]: Lupin.

2238
02:56:16,983 --> 02:56:19,987
[SPEAKER_08]: Because that was right before I passed Lupin because I had actually passed Hypnotic Crisis before.

2239
02:56:21,181 --> 02:56:22,364
[SPEAKER_08]: I let you change with my second one.

2240
02:56:23,165 --> 02:56:24,589
[SPEAKER_22]: That was Orion 7-8.

2241
02:56:24,649 --> 02:56:26,212
[SPEAKER_22]: I remember I did this at her place.

2242
02:56:26,352 --> 02:56:27,775
[SPEAKER_22]: I slowed it down and I listened.

2243
02:56:27,815 --> 02:56:30,461
[SPEAKER_22]: Because you remember how Orion 7-8 has this very distinct pattern.

2244
02:56:32,898 --> 02:56:49,008
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you remember back when you had a Bomani party and stuff and we debuted Kakumei on the sim because the game hadn't even come out yet but the sim file for the test location came out?

2245
02:56:49,028 --> 02:56:49,108
[SPEAKER_02]: I do.

2246
02:56:49,128 --> 02:56:49,588
[SPEAKER_22]: I remember that.

2247
02:56:49,608 --> 02:56:51,109
[SPEAKER_22]: That was so stupid.

2248
02:56:51,269 --> 02:56:51,689
[SPEAKER_22]: But good.

2249
02:56:51,729 --> 02:56:52,570
[SPEAKER_22]: No, it was good.

2250
02:56:53,110 --> 02:56:54,051
[SPEAKER_22]: And it was so easy.

2251
02:56:54,471 --> 02:56:55,572
[SPEAKER_22]: I miss Bomani parties.

2252
02:56:55,592 --> 02:56:56,312
[SPEAKER_22]: We need to have another one.

2253
02:56:56,732 --> 02:56:58,053
[SPEAKER_22]: We do.

2254
02:56:58,313 --> 02:57:00,215
[SPEAKER_22]: Let's just get drunk and call it a Bomani party.

2255
02:57:01,175 --> 02:57:03,299
[SPEAKER_08]: I think once I get my house in order, I'm planning on having one.

2256
02:57:03,539 --> 02:57:04,020
[SPEAKER_22]: Badass.

2257
02:57:04,100 --> 02:57:04,901
[SPEAKER_22]: If Dan doesn't like it.

2258
02:57:04,921 --> 02:57:05,983
[SPEAKER_22]: We should broadcast live from it.

2259
02:57:06,884 --> 02:57:07,606
[SPEAKER_08]: That would rock.

2260
02:57:07,866 --> 02:57:15,659
[SPEAKER_22]: Legend of Zaku says, how come game chain stores and some small time mom and pop stores treat new sealed games like beater copies when trying to get money for them?

2261
02:57:17,641 --> 02:57:18,723
[SPEAKER_22]: because they assume you stole them.

2262
02:57:19,063 --> 02:57:24,891
[SPEAKER_22]: Honestly, I think that's why a lot of people have policies against sealed games is because it's assumed that they're stolen.

2263
02:57:24,931 --> 02:57:25,813
[SPEAKER_22]: And I know what you're doing.

2264
02:57:25,853 --> 02:57:26,654
[SPEAKER_22]: I know you didn't steal them.

2265
02:57:26,694 --> 02:57:30,800
[SPEAKER_22]: I know you're trying to sell back promo copies, but you're not supposed to sell back promo copies either.

2266
02:57:31,060 --> 02:57:31,761
[SPEAKER_22]: It's actually...

2267
02:57:33,002 --> 02:57:34,323
[SPEAKER_22]: I don't know so much about giveaways.

2268
02:57:34,383 --> 02:57:37,505
[SPEAKER_22]: Giveaways is kind of a gray area, but at least promo copies.

2269
02:57:37,605 --> 02:57:42,067
[SPEAKER_22]: Usually when they do giveaways, they give away promo copies and it's part of the deal with promo copies.

2270
02:57:42,087 --> 02:57:43,008
[SPEAKER_22]: You're not supposed to sell them.

2271
02:57:43,268 --> 02:57:46,510
[SPEAKER_22]: That's why with motion pictures and stuff, big deal.

2272
02:57:46,530 --> 02:57:48,631
[SPEAKER_22]: They put the tracking numbers on the screeners and all that shit.

2273
02:57:49,932 --> 02:57:50,332
[SPEAKER_22]: Crazy stuff.

2274
02:57:56,871 --> 02:58:03,917
[SPEAKER_22]: What can I use to convert WMV3 encoded media to anything that isn't WMV3?

2275
02:58:04,338 --> 02:58:06,119
[SPEAKER_22]: AVI, MPEG, DivX, etc.

2276
02:58:06,219 --> 02:58:06,780
[SPEAKER_22]: on a PC.

2277
02:58:07,480 --> 02:58:08,181
[SPEAKER_22]: I have no idea.

2278
02:58:08,241 --> 02:58:10,163
[SPEAKER_22]: I don't know enough about video encoding, I'm going to be honest.

2279
02:58:10,623 --> 02:58:11,824
[SPEAKER_22]: Google and look it up.

2280
02:58:12,925 --> 02:58:13,385
[SPEAKER_22]: Or VCD Helper.

2281
02:58:16,053 --> 02:58:18,835
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I haven't heard of this.

2282
02:58:19,316 --> 02:58:19,876
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a website.

2283
02:58:20,837 --> 02:58:22,438
[SPEAKER_02]: They have tutorials for converting everything.

2284
02:58:22,718 --> 02:58:24,920
[SPEAKER_02]: But this is Windows Media file.

2285
02:58:26,621 --> 02:58:30,945
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm guessing probably Windows Media.

2286
02:58:31,105 --> 02:58:31,565
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

2287
02:58:31,725 --> 02:58:40,352
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe a program like TMG Encoder or whatever.

2288
02:58:41,033 --> 02:58:42,354
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm hoping someone in our chat knows.

2289
02:58:43,502 --> 02:58:45,944
[SPEAKER_08]: We just had a link posted to JetAudio.com.

2290
02:58:46,604 --> 02:58:47,044
[SPEAKER_22]: There we go.

2291
02:58:47,605 --> 02:58:48,085
[SPEAKER_22]: There you have it.

2292
02:58:48,746 --> 02:58:49,606
[SPEAKER_22]: Well, kids, it's about 9.30.

2293
02:58:49,726 --> 02:58:51,888
[SPEAKER_22]: It's about time for us to wrap up the show.

2294
02:58:52,148 --> 02:58:54,129
[SPEAKER_22]: And I appreciate you guys participating tonight.

2295
02:58:54,169 --> 02:58:55,530
