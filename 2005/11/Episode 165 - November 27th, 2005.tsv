109	7210	Monkey, Monkey, Monkey, Monkey, Monkey, Monkey, Monkey, Monkey, I'm gonna be a monkey.
7270	11831	Monkey, Monkey, Monkey, would you like to be one too?
12451	18092	Okay, if you wanna be a monkey, you gotta learn to act like a monkey.
18212	22873	And I've got the know-how, cause I've seen every car and movie ever made.
22933	24293	So watch and learn.
28314	30079	Hey, everybody.
30580	35171	I just made up a song, and I hope you can sing along with me.
36198	37799	It's called I'm a Cucumber.
38019	38440	Here we go.
39020	40581	One, two, three, four.
41502	42482	I'm a cucumber.
43543	44524	I'm a cucumber.
45605	46605	I'm a cucumber.
47626	48587	I'm a cucumber.
49647	50628	I'm a cucumber.
51629	52609	I'm a cucumber.
52950	56772	Please don't take me to Pickle Farm.
57273	60195	Thank you very much, everybody.
60235	60575	Thank you.

88788	93769	Tonight on Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 165, more dick and fart jokes with Bomani.
98271	106313	We're going to talk a lot tonight about catching up with Jamie, because it's been a little while, because she's been bogged down by viruses.
107737	115343	and hopefully she's not contagious because we don't all want to catch bubonic plague.
115563	116964	But we might all catch ferret.
117444	118725	We shall see on tonight's episode.
118825	130414	Also tonight, your calls and such and more information on DER Strike and Miklatov's in the house for a little bit to talk about his love for something that isn't a video game.
131855	132375	I know that.
133256	134977	And God knows what else.

278894	280594	My name is Rob Roberts, you might know me as Sky.

283635	286776	Welcome back, the happiest bunny on the farm, Dark Sakura.
287036	287256	Hi.
287536	287876	How are you?
289085	290965	Um, I don't know.
291746	298567	You don't, you say you're still kind of, you're obviously, you're coughing right now, that's not picking up on the mic, but you don't sound sick.
298687	305508	Like the last two weeks you sounded sick, but now it's kind of one of those, you obviously have a virus or something because you don't sound sick.
305908	310029	I don't have a virus, it's bacterial and my voice does on occasion come and go.
310209	310449	Okay.
310469	312750	That's why I didn't really talk much today.
312770	314590	Yeah, but you sound pretty solid tonight, so.
314930	315130	Yeah.
315598	317139	I apparently have whooping cough now.
318339	321960	Yeah, we're going to play the Wheel of Infection, I think it's what Loki called it.
322280	324141	Wheel of Infection, turn, turn, turn.
324181	326181	Show us which disease Jamie should have.
326361	336085	Thing is, is that whooping cough is something you're inoculated against when you're younger, only it apparently has something like some 10, 20% chance of hitting you when you're older.
337045	337525	Fun, huh?
338065	338445	Exciting.
338965	339586	Yay, diseases.
340807	342654	So we'll be talking diseases with Jamie tonight.
342775	345345	Also, in that corner, we'll be talking hamburgers with Loki!
346311	347032	I'm almost done.
347932	349934	How is your biggest gainer adventure going?
351075	351475	It's going.
351956	354018	I haven't had McDonald's, though, in a week, at least.
354138	356640	Well, that's an accomplishment, I suppose.
356680	360943	I mean, I had turkey this week, so no time for McDonald's.
361043	368650	But no, I actually just kind of wanted something quick, didn't have anything, so I got two cheeseburgers, which is a lot better than having a double quarter pounder, I mean, obviously.
369010	369531	I guess.
369871	374695	But you know what would be really good would be like one of those fruit and walnut salads would be a really good choice.
374915	375876	Well, there's a problem here.
376156	376976	That's actually worse.
377536	377917	Really?
378157	379077	I don't eat salad.
379698	380978	If you use half the walnuts.
381038	381839	They're heavy sugar.
381859	383720	I mean, it's candied walnuts.
383740	386501	I only use half the walnuts because I know that they're candied walnuts.
386661	390123	And dried fruit is even higher in sugar than... Yes, it is.
390984	392164	It concentrates the sugar.
392184	394325	I hate the regular... I don't like their regular salads.
394346	397347	If I'm going to get a regular salad, I want like Fresh Choice, Laboo, a real salad place.
397387	398468	I can't do McDonald's salads.
399048	399429	But anyway.
399930	402634	I'm eating one of their salads right now and I find it highly tasty.
402835	404177	I don't, bleh, I can't do it.
404317	404938	I hate salads.
405139	406140	I hate the taste of lettuce.
406461	407623	I've tried it numerous times.
407904	408865	I do not like lettuce.
410368	410889	It's awful.
411195	413356	Lettuce is something I used to hate as a child, but I like it now.
413496	416097	I don't care for lettuce, I prefer spinach, and this has spinach in it.
416297	416778	Spinach is good.
416858	422100	Anyway, we'll talk plenty of food later throughout the show, but also say hello to the one and only Mikotov.
422540	422941	Hello.
423221	424941	Are you playing Mario Kart Online right now?
425102	426422	No, I'm trying to unlock Rob.
427343	428003	Oh, I'm right here.
430844	431384	God, I'm funny.
431565	432725	He's working on the chassis he built.
433105	433385	I see.
434926	435246	What?
436427	437667	I somehow highly doubt that.
438588	438808	Anyway.
439653	440834	How far are you in Unlocking Rob?
440874	441375	You almost there?
442976	446039	Um, I have like two more races, and then, yeah, I finished.
446299	451644	Alright, well stop interrupting him then, because he's very zen-like in playing his Mario Kart over there, so we'll leave him alone.
451664	456949	I've taken a break from Mario Kart today to actually be doing the show, and there's a puzzle with this mic.
457289	457709	I can't speak.
458230	459011	I refuse to play.
460172	461813	I want more information on this when we come back.
461833	462933	We're going to take a quick break, though.
463874	466796	And I got to play Tent Style this week, so I'm in a very Tent Style-ish mood.
467597	469158	So we're going to play some music from Tent Style.
469498	471159	And then we'll come back and do our show.
471540	473841	So join our chatroom, www.orangelandreo.com.
474141	474802	We'll be right back.
474922	480446	After this, we're going to start it off with a song called Strong Woman.
481246	482267	One of the CS songs.
482667	483448	Hopefully it works.
483468	483708	I don't know.
483748	485830	I just got this before the show started, so I hope it works.
486170	487531	We'll be back after this with more Orange Lingerie.
597997	601008	I just ain't got no way to go
834549	835436	Thanks for watching!
949505	954288	From StepSquad to OrangeLoud, this PDR sucks!
954628	957550	Holla, holla, holla, holla, holla, holla, holla!
963206	965128	Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio.
965148	968490	We're in the middle of episode number 165, if you can believe it.
968851	972934	I was just kind of thinking about today, you know, 165 doesn't sound like a big number.
973515	975416	Would you consider that that's one a week?
976317	977358	That is an awfully long time.
977638	978399	165 weeks.
978719	982002	That doesn't even count weeks off and stuff, because we're entitled to a week off once in a while, damn it.
982542	982942	Yes, Loki?
983503	983743	Thought.
983823	985004	You have your finger up in thought.
986325	988867	Your mic's not on, but... Why'd you turn the mic off?
989268	989748	Bad you.
990288	991009	Okay, um...
991539	993707	Is 169 going to be on New Year's Eve?
995225	995965	I don't know.
996125	999166	We have to decide, and we can worry about this next month if we're going to do shows.
999186	1001867	Because I think, isn't Christmas and New Year's Eve on a Sunday this year?
1002107	1002647	Both are.
1003107	1004548	See, I don't know if we want to do shows then.
1006348	1008849	I don't know about you, but I'm not going to be here on Christmas.
1008889	1011990	Yeah, New Year's Eve, definitely not, because there's other things I've got to do.
1012090	1014051	So we might be taking some time off for the holidays.
1014271	1014851	And you know what?
1015691	1016131	We earned it.
1016291	1017091	So shut up.
1017111	1018932	Someone's going to be listening anyway.
1018972	1021213	We'll do a marathon or something special.
1021253	1022133	We're pre-recorded.
1022433	1025495	A little special treat for... Yeah, nobody's going to want to listen to us on New Year's Eve.
1025555	1025815	Come on.
1026676	1029037	People are going to go out to parties and stuff.
1029317	1033079	Maybe the dude that records us every week will record the station to see what was here.
1033340	1034920	Actually, there's several people that are recording us.
1035281	1039423	But I don't see a big demand for programming on New Year's Eve.
1039523	1041724	Now I've got to talk to...
1042987	1044548	DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
1072136	1073817	Okay, granted, but you know.
1073837	1074037	And me.
1075118	1075538	Oh, whatever.
1075678	1076018	I don't care.
1076038	1080501	I can get near alcohol poisoning, but I don't get hangovers.
1080541	1080921	Go, Greg.
1081261	1082862	Okay.
1082922	1084063	Lots of good points in the chat.
1084083	1085063	I've seen how the chat was lighting up.
1085543	1086604	What about Jewish people?
1086904	1087965	They want a show on Christmas.
1090239	1092480	We can do the Hanukkah special.
1092540	1094201	Hanukkah starts today after Christmas.
1094241	1098302	I want to do like a Kwanzaa special, Orange Lounge Radio Kwanzaa special.
1098442	1100763	Why don't we do the generic holiday special?
1101043	1101624	Maybe, we'll see.
1101804	1103104	The pick your holiday special.
1103184	1107346	We'll do Orange Lounge celebrates Hallmark's Christmas.
1107788	1110569	That'll be a Hallmark Presents, the Orange Lawn Trio.
1110589	1116192	We'll get Extifer in here to share some stories with the Hallmark Trademark.
1117653	1119474	Let's see what else they're saying in the chatroom there.
1119774	1122055	Oh, everybody's booing us for not wanting to do a Christmas episode.
1123176	1123536	Bitches.
1125277	1127818	Well, excuse me, maybe we'd like to spend time with our family.
1127838	1129039	Yeah, we want to open up presents.
1129239	1130840	That's a very important part of Christmas.
1130860	1131380	Not Christmas Day.
1131400	1133681	I want Christmas nookie, dammit, and I'm not going to be here.
1133761	1134401	Exactly.
1134501	1135542	I want Christmas nookie, too.
1137921	1138822	Anyway, how was Thanksgiving?
1138842	1139942	Did you get any Thanksgiving, Nookie?
1141263	1142804	No, I'm still too sick.
1144406	1154552	I ate my food, and then I got such a bad headache trying to watch Dan play Perfect Dark Zero, which was a very pretty, very pretty game.
1155828	1162532	Actually, it wasn't Dan who was giving me the headache, it was watching his friend who completely sucks at that game being like an absolute retard playing it.
1163033	1167436	So, uh, I, uh, I mean, he was really making some dumb mistakes.
1167896	1174480	So, uh, I just sort of laid back and threw a pillow in Dan's lap and passed out.
1175120	1177222	And I actually did fall asleep for something like two hours.
1178843	1179904	But you're sick, so you can't.
1180164	1181825	I still feel crappy.
1183956	1184856	DarkSakura, how was your week?
1184936	1185557	How was your day?
1185577	1186237	How was my month?
1186277	1187358	How was your month?
1187418	1188798	It's been a little while since I've been here.
1214597	1218001	It involves lung cookies and homework and that's about it.
1218963	1220525	I slept 16 hours yesterday.
1221225	1222847	I slept 17 hours last Saturday.
1224159	1228503	I had lung spasms at work Friday and had to go home the week before.
1230685	1237511	I've been really, really crappy sick and haven't even felt much like playing anything, let alone sitting up and going to work.
1238552	1242635	I opened World of Warcraft and then shut it down.
1243556	1246879	And then last night around 1am I played some We Love Katamari.
1248433	1249933	and then started getting really motion sick.
1251474	1255955	It's like my stomach has gone between being ravenously hungry and being very nauseated.
1256595	1263057	So, trying to play Wheel of Katamari while being highly nauseated anyway just spells disaster.
1263737	1266418	Spells don't make any plans because it's all coming up.
1268339	1270119	That's one way of explaining it, I suppose.
1270659	1270999	All right.
1271680	1272420	Loki, how was your week?
1272460	1272800	How was your day?
1273359	1275281	My week was good because there was turkey involved.
1276542	1279244	And then, you know, it was a very chaotic week.
1279264	1280665	I got my car fixed, finally.
1282046	1283167	And that was cool.
1283647	1284628	And then I had turkey.
1285069	1285869	That was also good.
1286750	1291254	Then the rest of the week, you know, the last four days was really trying to be productive, but that didn't happen.
1291654	1291774	So...
1293686	1298567	No, instead I kind of wandered around on Black Friday trying to see if there was any 360s around.
1299607	1300827	Oh, give me a break.
1300968	1304248	I mean, did you really think you were going to find a 360 on Black Friday?
1305588	1307529	No, I just wanted to get out of the house.
1307549	1308589	Oh, okay.
1309029	1312130	So I went and picked up another game for the 360 I don't have yet.
1312710	1313770	So I have Cameo now.
1313950	1315230	Luckily, there's a used copy.
1315290	1316811	Someone already put out a used copy.
1317691	1318711	That's interesting.
1319491	1321152	It's probably a review copy or something.
1321972	1322752	Something like that.
1323188	1325189	Yeah, not like any of the copies I bring back are.
1325990	1330412	Anyways, then I went to Best Buy and wandered around there for about a few seconds.
1331072	1337936	They have quite a few Xboxes and the PS2 Slims.
1337976	1339697	They were blocking off aisles with them.
1340177	1343619	I'm like, okay, I get the point that you have lots of these systems available.
1344219	1347161	Not the one I'm looking for, but I don't know.
1347341	1348782	I'm just kind of fed up with Best Buy.
1348942	1353186	Dude, why were people lined up at 10 o'clock Thanksgiving evening outside Best Buy?
1353286	1355107	Like, they were camped out for Black Friday?
1356788	1361512	Can you give a microphone to make it sound... There were, like, computers for, like, $150.
1361632	1362173	Decent ones?
1362553	1363054	I think so.
1363214	1364034	Yeah, and laptops for, like, $200.
1364134	1364235	Okay.
1364375	1364495	Wow.
1364775	1366356	I don't know.
1366396	1367597	Hell, maybe I should have camped out, too.
1368438	1371040	They had some HP computers or something.
1371060	1371521	I don't know.
1373182	1374323	I just didn't really want it.
1375344	1376765	Didn't Walmart do some type of, like...
1378658	1381680	They were talking about it, and I don't know if they did or not.
1381920	1383461	It was a big mess.
1384121	1391285	But I actually went to GameStop that day, thinking, oh, well, the GameStop by my house is normally not crowded at all.
1391345	1395308	They had like a freaking line of seven people in there at about noon.
1395788	1396428	It was crazy.
1397249	1401691	Because I wanted to see, first off, where it was on the Xbox 360 pre-orders, and also...
1405333	1409494	You know, whether or not they had any accessories and stuff and possibly games.
1409954	1416635	But now I'm to the point now I have the four games I kind of wanted and there's really nothing else I want except for maybe DOA 4.
1417216	1420576	But once that comes out, there's nothing I want for at least a few months.
1421116	1429218	And actually, looking at my list of games coming out, there's nothing coming out for the 360 until February.
1430678	1433359	It's like PSP Syndrome all over again or Nintendo DS.
1433379	1433559	Yeah.
1434400	1435341	That's crazy, though.
1435361	1445529	I mean, even... I mean, excluding the delay on Dead or Alive 4, you would actually have two months of nothing for the 360, and I mean, that's pretty bad.
1445729	1446970	When's that Baldur's Gate coming out?
1447030	1448191	Did that get pushed all the way back to February?
1448211	1449672	Elder Scrolls is coming out in April or March.
1449692	1450853	Why did I say Baldur's Gate?
1451633	1454175	It's Elder Scrolls... I think March now.
1454976	1456197	March or April, I can't remember.
1457678	1461101	The only big games coming out... December is nothing.
1461501	1463803	The only real game worth mentioning is actually...
1464943	1467145	and just Gauntlet Seven Sorrows.
1467265	1467685	That's it.
1468225	1470707	That and Dead or Alive because Dead or Alive got pushed back.
1470767	1474289	Gauntlet Seven Sorrows is also coming out on the other systems too, so it doesn't really matter.
1474729	1475349	Well, that's not on the 360.
1475689	1477130	I'm just talking games in general.
1477410	1477811	Oh, shit.
1477971	1483694	And then for the month of January, 25 to Life, which would be pretty big.
1484451	1496498	Well, there's really... January is a very slow period for games, just as it is for movies, because after the holidays, there's really nothing up again until, you know, I don't know, early spring period.
1496538	1501321	Probably, there's going to be a very big lull between the holidays and probably summer.
1501742	1502382	There usually is.
1502922	1506204	Yeah, it should be... You get a couple big titles in February.
1506385	1508666	I think we're getting Prime Hunters on the DS somewhere in there.
1508926	1509326	March?
1509486	1509767	Yeah.
1510347	1511888	Well, you get a couple big titles, but that's about it.
1513575	1520640	I'm thinking now I've got to put down my money for a Revolution and a PS3 if I want them.
1521080	1525203	PS3 I'm not so worried about because they haven't even really announced a date for that yet.
1525383	1529866	I'm thinking it's not going to be until the fall anyways of next year.
1530996	1532738	Revolution, though, I'd be wanting to pick up.
1532938	1535760	I think Revolution and PS3 will both be out by next Christmas, I really do.
1536081	1539864	I think they're going to rush them just like Xbox rushed to get out there, but I think they'll be out there by Christmas.
1539884	1541546	Revolution, they've been taking their time on, so.
1541686	1545489	Yeah, but I think, you know, the fact that they haven't said a lot about it, I think is a good sign.
1545970	1548392	I think it's going to be like a Nintendo 64 launch.
1550874	1551175	Comment?
1551795	1552236	Sorry.
1552876	1556740	I'm just seeing the 360 going the way of the Dreamcast.
1557924	1558384	Interesting.
1558425	1559425	There's a lot in common.
1559986	1566792	I saw that story on 1up.com that shared what they had in common, but that's the same marketing guys behind them both, isn't it?
1567632	1568693	I don't get the commercials.
1568753	1569354	They're stupid.
1570074	1571676	I haven't even seen an Xbox 360 commercial.
1571776	1578241	Well, you probably don't even realize it is an Xbox 360 commercial unless you watch it all the way through because they don't say or show anything about the Xbox 360.
1578281	1583986	They show kids playing and really cryptic, artistic crap, and then they go, Xbox 360!
1585007	1588471	It reminds me of this commercial we made for our economics class.
1589051	1593175	It was basically a bunch of kick-ass clips of action sequences during movies.
1593575	1596778	Like explosions and people getting beat up and stuff.
1596838	1598880	And at the very end, buy bumper stickers.
1599301	1599981	And that was it.
1600222	1600982	That was the whole thing.
1601022	1605267	And this is kind of like the whole 360 thing.
1605587	1609751	You show a bunch of kids playing and having a water balloon fight or something.
1610291	1612334	360, it's like, you look at it and you're like, what the hell?
1612374	1612835	I don't get it.
1612875	1616400	That doesn't say anything about the system, what it does, what it is.
1616901	1618143	It just shows kids playing.
1618423	1621868	Okay, so the 360 is a watermelon launcher?
1621928	1622930	I mean, what the hell is it?
1625233	1625714	It's stupid.
1628341	1634564	I barely watch TV at all, and even the few shows I do watch, thanks to the lovely DVR we have, I fast forward through all the commercials.
1634805	1636886	So I don't have to watch it.
1636906	1638887	So that's why I'm like, oh, there's a funny commercial?
1638947	1639267	I don't know.
1640328	1640548	Anyway.
1641449	1642809	Anything else you want to share about your week and your day?
1643810	1645251	No, that's pretty much it.
1645291	1652936	My week and my day, I went to GameStop on Black Friday as well, but I went to the one near here, and the line was only about one, two people, like it usually is.
1653016	1653236	Nothing...
1653629	1654029	Dragon Quest VIII
1680431	1682752	And it looked pretty cool, so I wanted to pick it up and play it.
1684593	1686914	And also the Final Fantasy XII demo, which is very, very sexy.
1687134	1689295	I'm going to let you borrow it so you can see it, because it's very sexy.
1690216	1690616	No need.
1690636	1691536	Oh, you already got it?
1693817	1694237	I found it.
1694678	1696238	You acquired it.
1696258	1697119	I acquired it.
1697319	1699540	You acquired it through your various contacts.
1699920	1701181	Do you need it, or do you already have it?
1701401	1704462	Because I'll let you borrow the Final Fantasy XII demo, which is pretty cool.
1705450	1706412	I have the trailer.
1707194	1708476	It's a playable demo.
1708656	1709337	Oh, no I don't.
1709438	1710980	You want to borrow it?
1711000	1711181	Sure.
1711581	1711962	Very cool.
1712964	1713885	Sounds like it was like 11.
1713926	1716811	I just got the Dragon Warrior 9 or whatever one.
1718927	1720508	Whatever the new Dragon Quest is.
1720528	1721048	Dragon Quest.
1721068	1722588	Yeah, about the actual game, Dragon Quest VIII.
1722608	1723948	I'm the one saying Dragon Warrior.
1724729	1725389	Dragon Quest.
1725409	1727909	Well, they went back to Dragon Quest.
1727929	1730950	Because Squeenix is doing this whole mea culpa.
1730990	1733550	Yes, we did change the names of all your games.
1733591	1734931	We released them in the U.S.
1734971	1736151	for Nintendo.
1736331	1737111	Here, we fix.
1737331	1737811	We fix.
1739732	1741412	I'll talk more about Dragon Quest on the podcast.
1741452	1743373	But, yeah, I like that game.
1743893	1744033	And...
1745350	1757415	I've been playing a little bit of Mario Kart here and there, and World of Warcraft, a little bit, a little bit, not a whole lot though, and that's about it.
1760376	1764097	I'm using the crappy mic tonight, so if my voice fades in and out just because I'm on the crappy mic tonight.
1766458	1771840	I didn't really do anything for Thanksgiving, because I have a small family, so it's just me, my mom, and my dad, so we just went out to eat.
1772298	1773079	DarkSakura, DarkSakura.com
1795970	1796430	That's about it.
1797711	1805653	It's just been very nice to have these past few days off of work, because I'm not going to have a vacation like this again until like February, because I'm taking some massive time off in February.
1806213	1809114	And it's just very nice to have a break.
1809435	1810435	So I feel very charged.
1810455	1811675	I'm very relaxed tonight.
1814056	1814596	I hate this mic.
1814616	1816457	I'm in a pretty decent mood, all things considered.
1816477	1818718	But yeah.
1819955	1821216	So, Miklatov, you're here.
1821236	1824517	I know you're in the middle of a race, but you gotta pause that for a minute.
1825177	1832800	And of course, we have to give the disclaimer that, you know, even though he works for Konami, don't read into too much anything that he says, because he's not here to represent Konami tonight, he's here to represent himself.
1833440	1833580	Yes?
1833780	1834421	As usual.
1834601	1835001	As usual.
1835301	1836421	So, how was your week?
1836441	1836902	How was your day?
1837382	1839563	My week was pretty boring, because all I do is work.
1840983	1845185	Mario Kart has taken over our office every break, almost every lunch.
1845685	1847366	We play eight-player matches.
1847426	1848006	It's really fun.
1848624	1852674	I love hearing that at Konami you'll play games by other people all the time.
1852895	1854359	I'm sure all the other companies do it too.
1854399	1855020	It's just kind of neat.
1855902	1856242	Yeah.
1856682	1864385	We even use our DSs that we're not supposed to use for actual gaming to play, because not everybody has a DS there.
1865205	1868726	And then I saw Rent, which is an amazing movie.
1869206	1871547	Don't say anything, Rob.
1871627	1872247	It's your moment.
1872307	1873167	I'll let you have your moment.
1873187	1873688	It's a great movie.
1873728	1874808	I saw it twice, actually.
1876689	1881610	And I picked up Brokeback Mountain.
1882110	1884071	Two books of it and the soundtrack.
1885983	1888406	How do you buy two books of Brokeback Mountain?
1888927	1891370	Well, they released a standalone.
1891410	1896296	It's really just a short story from a collection of cowboy western stories.
1897048	1906033	So I picked up the book that had all those short stories in it, and then they also released the one for the movie that's coming out, and I picked that one up also, and the soundtrack.
1906933	1907754	And I'm in love.
1908794	1909175	A lot.
1909535	1909855	Okay.
1910315	1911316	And the movie comes out when?
1911576	1912516	December 9th.
1912676	1918399	I thought it was next week, and then to my horrible, horrible dismay, it's actually two weeks from now.
1919540	1923202	So now next week's going to be depressing, because that's all I was looking forward to.
1923342	1923742	I'm sorry.
1924383	1924583	It's okay.
1924603	1924763	Okay.
1925256	1925656	and many more.
1943268	1949694	Anything that you've by chance maybe been spinning a turntable or making some arrow-stomping noises to?
1949914	1951576	I refuse to comment.
1953037	1953618	I have to try.
1953658	1956680	The listeners would get angry and say that, you know, we're a farce if I didn't try.
1956780	1958021	The Mario Kart music.
1959202	1965908	Oh, and a lot of random 90s music I've been listening to at work lately, but nothing to do with DDR or anything like that, so don't read into that.
1965928	1967330	Just, that's what I play when I'm doing...
1969619	1971481	So I hear Rhythm Is A Dancer a lot.
1972822	1973763	I don't know if I can say it.
1974304	1980390	There was something that happened once that involved work and somebody hearing a song a lot that was really, really funny that happened once.
1980410	1981291	Damien Busters?
1981571	1982972	Yeah, can I say that on the air?
1983032	1983413	I don't know.
1984154	1986156	It's in the past, so I can say that now, right?
1986896	1987677	I won't say who it was.
1987777	1988678	I'll just say somebody.
1988738	1989459	It wasn't in the past.
1989479	1993423	Somebody who also is very close with Konami said... Used to be.
1993743	1994643	Yeah, well, whatever.
1995484	2010151	It was this song that was playing on the Dave & Buster's radio station, and she said, or he or she said, shit, he or she said, he or she said that, fuck, I don't know if I can do this story now.
2010251	2012872	Now our picture is falling down the stairs.
2014053	2016915	I don't know if I can continue this story now because I don't want to get anybody in trouble.
2017355	2018155	They don't work there anymore.
2018235	2019516	Alright, it's fine.
2019916	2027600	The person said that, oh man, I can't get this song out of my head because I've been hearing it at work so much lately and I'm like, oh really?
2028340	2030862	Turns out it was an Ultramix 2 license that nobody knew about yet.
2032062	2035083	And the rest of my week was watching that next clip constantly
2052228	2052588	Next Next Next
2068815	2076825	So she's walking out of the van thing, and she's doing her little spiel for the camera, and as she's saying that, she falls down the steps.
2077565	2084273	It's really funny because they freeze frame on her falling down, and she has the best expression on her face.
2085347	2088068	It's somewhere between laughing and just shock.
2088328	2089049	It's really great.
2089929	2092310	And she was a stupid whore anyway.
2093810	2098712	I love how he's like, so I just wanted you to walk over here because I wasn't sure if you were okay or not.
2099013	2099433	Next.
2100733	2102574	Yeah, that was nice.
2104432	2104832	Let's see.
2106173	2108233	Oh, I know what I wanted to ask you about as well.
2109253	2114495	One little work-related thing that I'm okay to say, I think, is that you met LED.
2114675	2115435	Yeah, I met LED.
2115455	2115895	How was that?
2116075	2117415	I got to have dinner with LED.
2117615	2118215	Really?
2118255	2119036	Was it a nice dinner?
2119056	2120496	Did you guys go to a fancy restaurant?
2120536	2123357	We went to TGI Fridays, because he wanted American.
2123657	2124417	Well, that's good stuff.
2124557	2125197	Yeah, it was pretty good.
2125797	2128778	You probably can't say much about the details of what you guys talked about, but...
2129598	2131861	Anything interesting that you might be able to share?
2131881	2135126	Does he seem to be aware that he has quite a following here in the U.S. ?
2144733	2151015	I don't think that was brought up, but I think he would have to be stupid to know that.
2153335	2157756	I don't know what I can really say from the dinner, but there was one funny thing.
2157796	2164478	It was me and a couple other people from work, and he asked us what types of music we listened to.
2165919	2171060	At the time, it was like I was listening to drum and bass a lot, and I also said Eurobeat.
2171574	2176437	and he kind of groaned and said Eurobeat after me.
2176818	2178639	He was rather disgusted with that answer.
2179539	2180520	I thought it was funny.
2180580	2181601	You make LED cry.
2181621	2182721	I do.
2184002	2184583	That's great.
2184683	2185423	Yeah, it was funny.
2185563	2186064	That's cool.
2186844	2187164	Good job.
2188065	2189886	Alright, moving on.
2190146	2191307	If you have nothing else to say for now.
2192087	2193308	Nope.
2193989	2195029	Brokeback Mountain's awesome.
2196607	2202192	Let's go, okay, since we can't ask these things of Miklatov, we can mention them ourselves if we pick stuff up along the wire.
2202232	2204053	Something about Beatmania getting pushed back again?
2204073	2204354	Yeah.
2204374	2204974	You found this out?
2205054	2205475	What happened?
2205835	2207336	It's, dates changed.
2208617	2213702	We get updates like at least once a week from like all the different companies when stuff's coming out.
2214322	2223270	And the tentative date of, what was it, like February 9th is no longer, it's now being pushed back to March something.
2223669	2232515	You know what I think is interesting is that finally after this website's been running for about three and a half years now, people are considering us like a legitimate news source.
2232575	2237818	Just for the record, remind our audience where you get your information and why it's pretty reliable.
2238277	2245244	My information comes directly from our buyer because our buyer talks to Konami directly.
2245344	2251389	They give us the dates so we know when product's coming out, so we know when we can sell it, when orders are due, etc.
2251489	2259216	So we have to know what the upcoming slate of titles is going to be and that's how I know what movie titles and game titles because...
2260117	2264702	I work at a friggin' distributor, so you have to know what's coming out when.
2264822	2266504	So, that's the tentative date.
2267005	2271630	But, you know, like most games, dates shift around, like, weekly.
2271890	2278818	So, you know, what might be March today, could be January, could be April, who knows.
2279599	2280340	Like, for example...
2281460	2286183	Tomb Raider, the new one, Tomb Raider Legends or whatever it was.
2286243	2287904	The Tomb Raider, I don't care anymore.
2287964	2290425	Yeah, Tomb Raider, trying to reinvent ourselves, Tomb Raider.
2290845	2299430	Anyway, that game was originally slated for January, moved to April, moved back to January, moved back to April, moved back to January, and now it's in April.
2299970	2302832	It's like they can't figure out when they want to release a stupid game.
2304233	2305333	But that's a perfect example.
2305553	2307634	Usually Konami, though, they don't shift their dates around that much.
2307795	2308335	It's usually...
2309554	2312175	A couple, and once it gets closer to it, it's set in stone.
2312555	2315796	EA, on the other hand, they like shifting their dates all over the damn place.
2316196	2316796	How about Square?
2318177	2318557	Square?
2318897	2321538	Not so much, but not many Square games come out.
2321578	2324539	I mean, that's what we've had two in the last four months.
2324619	2327500	Well, a question from the chat room, Advent Children, what's the status on that?
2327580	2329140	You know when that's slated to come out now?
2329240	2330421	That's to be announced still.
2330761	2331001	Really?
2331021	2333281	It was going to be in February.
2334402	2337503	Then it was actually slated for...
2338763	2345348	The end of January, and then now we have it as moratorium in our system, meaning that we don't have a date yet.
2345508	2345949	Weird.
2346329	2347030	When it's coming out.
2347070	2348010	Why are they doing that?
2348050	2350472	That's so crazy, because people are pirating this movie.
2350692	2355356	Maybe that's why they're doing it, because of the piracy, they're going to have to go back and add all these extras that people are going to want to buy the DVD for.
2355396	2361781	I'm thinking they're probably trying to, because people bitch and moan about the fact that they don't have good box sets over here or anything like that.
2362181	2364763	I talk to the Sony guy, I always yell at him every time he comes in.
2365043	2365725	Thanks for watching!
2377310	2379391	You know, because I knew more about it than they did.
2379831	2384514	And, you know, I was like, why aren't you releasing the box sets here?
2384534	2386375	And they're like, oh, I don't know.
2386395	2391417	Oh, yeah, because I'm sure that one guy who comes to your company makes all the calls on what they're going to be releasing.
2391437	2395899	Well, a lot of the people that come to our company, though, are senior sales or whatever.
2395939	2398180	So they do have somewhat of a say.
2398701	2400822	But, you know, they...
2401741	2402041	I don't know.
2402301	2403262	I don't know when it's coming out.
2403722	2404742	All I know is I've seen it.
2404882	2405362	It's cool.
2406443	2407663	Hopefully it'll be coming out.
2408464	2410084	But, I don't know.
2410144	2412225	I always keep the website updated.
2412325	2414046	I post when it changes.
2414609	2419870	Another comment from our chatroom, from Ranchan, chatroom, by the way, OrangeLaunchRadio.com, click on chat.
2420710	2422751	Rumors are leaking out about theatrical release.
2423211	2424351	That's kind of true.
2424411	2426471	This has been something that's kind of been circulating for a while now.
2427251	2430712	We mentioned this on a podcast like months ago because I don't even remember where I picked up this bug.
2431092	2433493	Now, I want to say it was sometime around E3.
2433953	2435813	I picked up a bug, no, it was later than E3.
2436113	2436433	I remember.
2436453	2440014	It was a friend of a friend kind of thing, so take it with a grain of salt, but...
2440814	2442116	Final Fantasy Advent Children and IMAX
2455273	2455793	Okay, maybe not.
2455913	2460435	Yeah, they have Polar Express running right now on IMAX, but I think it needs to be an IMAX.
2460795	2462456	I mean, that'd be awesome if it was an IMAX.
2463016	2463296	Who knows?
2463436	2470159	And if that's the case, it's going to take a long time to, you know, to print digital to, you know, the IMAX film store.
2470179	2474961	Well, since the movie's all digital as it is, it won't take that long to enhance, so to speak, for the movie.
2475381	2475721	Not really.
2475741	2478442	Yeah.
2478462	2480763	Let's go to break.
2482611	2485232	We'll be back with more Orange Lounge Radio after this.
2593912	2594975	Thanks for watching!
2652909	2654634	Thanks for watching!
2688231	2688893	Thanks for watching!
2751673	2766823	You've got to forever The green grass blows and the wind is dancing It would be a much better sight With you, with me If you hadn't met me I'd be fine on my own, baby Never felt so lonely when you came along
2780531	2781551	and many more.
2801489	2802410	Thank you for watching!
2915817	2919679	Orange Lounge Radio, Bomani Music, and more.
2920279	2921180	Perfect!
2921680	2937027	We're back here on Orange Lounge Radio, and that break you heard Come With Me from Ultramix 3, Final Countdown from 2DX4Style, You're Not Here from Silent Hill, and then it was in DDR Extreme as well, and from Keyboard Mania 2nd Mix, Akumajo Dracula Medley, which is also now in DDR Ultramix 3 as well.
2937367	2941810	By the way, speaking of Castlevania songs and Bomani, I don't know if you saw that early song list for Beatmania...
2943070	2946414	I still want to call it 13th style.
2946474	2947776	I know that's a taboo thing to do.
2948116	2949257	No, it's not 13th style.
2949297	2950038	It's distorted.
2950519	2956385	But it does have 13 in the title this time, so I'm going to call it 13th style until I get yelled at.
2957066	2958748	But no, it's supposed to have bloody tears in it.
2959028	2960290	What is this you just pulled up there?
2975992	2977533	That's Ragnarok Online 2?
2991262	2994124	This means that Jamie's going to be quitting World of Warcraft awfully soon.
2994604	2996025	It's very fluid.
2996825	2997125	Yeah.
2997845	3002928	It's got a 3D fluid sense to it, where you're not warping into fights or anything.
3003488	3006269	Kind of reminds me of the Final Fantasy XII demo, I must say, actually.
3006750	3007150	A little bit.
3007390	3007730	A little bit.
3007750	3010992	Except you're by yourself, but of course that would be to be expected in an MMO.
3011372	3012172	That's Ragnarok 2.
3013153	3013493	Interesting.
3013513	3015314	And this is your customizing for your character.
3016905	3022069	Our chat room is yelling now for a link, so you better link them up.
3024130	3026192	Loki, you had some interesting observations on eBay?
3026652	3034518	Well, yeah, I was just looking at the... I was checking on there, there was this Beatmania final machine that was on sale for $99 before.
3034799	3038301	But I looked at the guy's other selling... He's selling some other Bomani stuff.
3039202	3040463	Keyboard Mania, third...
3042504	3042884	Uh, $280.
3043245	3044525	Holy fuck, I want that.
3044645	3045185	Oh my god.
3045385	3047326	I don't know where I would put that in this little apartment.
3047346	3049507	City of Industry is where it's at if you want to pick it up.
3049527	3050627	Does that mean it's AI selling it?
3050647	3051967	But it's not.
3051987	3052948	I don't think it's AI.
3053388	3056609	They're selling Dance Maniacs, Second Mix.
3056649	3057309	Hold on, what, Jamie?
3057429	3057609	What?
3058350	3062151	It had No Buy It Now on it and it had Many Days Left on the Bed when I looked at it.
3064832	3065192	Okay.
3067373	3068133	I'm sorry, go ahead, Loki.
3069014	3072555	They have a 2DX Red Machine for $5,100.
3072595	3076816	Beat Me at the final right now is only $152.50.
3076897	3079937	But they have a bunch of stuff.
3079997	3080878	Initial D3.
3082898	3087200	They have a Wang Dan Midnight Maximum Tune 2 Racing Machine for only $2,500.
3088702	3090084	Just a bunch of kick-ass stuff.
3090404	3099075	Drum Mania 5th, Guitar Freaks 5th, Dance Maniac 2nd, Extreme, and Boxing Mania.
3101027	3101888	Wow, that's pretty cool.
3101908	3107132	I wonder if that's AI unloading all that stuff, because you know Arcade Infinity had a lot of, and they're in City of Industry, or at least they're right next to it.
3107152	3108373	Yeah, we don't have a fifth mix, so.
3109834	3110495	They did, though.
3110675	3111396	They did at one point.
3111656	3112817	Well, it's probably upgraded, though.
3112837	3115039	I don't know.
3115179	3116860	I kind of want that Keyboard Mania machine.
3117080	3120083	I don't know why I'm so, like, into Keyboard Mania, but I am.
3120163	3121064	Like, I really want it.
3121164	3123646	If I had a house, I'd be getting something.
3124198	3124658	Thanks for watching!
3148897	3156020	Speaking of next year, it looks highly, highly probable I'm going to be at, now I haven't signed on the line and everything, but it's very, very probable.
3156060	3159882	And I know we have a lot of listeners on the East Coast who have asked me to hang out with them.
3161062	3161923	And I actually did.
3162003	3166545	When I went to Pennsylvania last time I was out there, I actually hung out with a couple of the listeners.
3166565	3166885	It was cool.
3166905	3167385	It was a good time.
3168025	3183090	I'm down for that again and the time and place to be at is Katsukan which is going to be in February I believe it's the 17th through 19th don't quote me on that but it's around there and in DC and it's looking very very likely I'm going to be there and possibly doing a panel which will be a lot of fun
3183410	3184070	That would be fun.
3184290	3187752	So I will let you know absolutely for sure the details as soon as I know.
3188653	3192034	And I've bought my plane tickets and everything, but it does look very likely I'm going to be there.
3192635	3193675	So I'm pretty excited.
3193915	3195076	I haven't been to D.C.
3195096	3195596	in a long time.
3195636	3198198	The only thing I'm kind of freaked out about is that in February it might be snowing.
3199198	3199418	Right?
3199898	3200579	Don't they get snow?
3201679	3203941	This is the California side of me.
3204721	3209363	Even though it does snow in some parts of California, I don't live in one of those parts, so I'm so ignorant when it comes to snow.
3210744	3211064	I don't know.
3211244	3212025	I've never been to D.C.,
3212958	3213898	I have before, it's fun.
3216279	3216559	Alright.
3219179	3219799	Uh, anyway.
3219819	3222080	Uh, moving on.
3222100	3224480	We were going to do Extroverse movie review, but the room cleared out.
3225700	3226861	Did somebody fart or something?
3226881	3228241	Because the room just cleared out.
3228481	3229181	His phone rang.
3229201	3230981	Miklatov ran out, Extroverse phone rang.
3231141	3234822	Miklatov's trying to pack his bags, because they're leaving soon, and DarkSakura had to go to the restroom, so.
3236142	3236662	Oh, gosh.
3238103	3238343	Anyway.
3239543	3239643	Um...
3241397	3243699	Let's see, what else, what else, what else?
3245701	3248203	I guess let's talk about the 360 for a little bit.
3249504	3253027	Some of the horror stories, did you hear about some of the horror stories when it came to the 360?
3253927	3260093	About like the Walmart that had the riot somewhere in Pennsylvania and there was EB games that got robbed?
3260113	3261234	I heard of some funny ones.
3261274	3261494	Uh-huh.
3261954	3268241	There was one where there was a big line out in front of this Walmart, I think it was, or Walmart Target, something like that.
3269443	3274549	So a big line of people and they had one cop sitting there making sure nothing's gone wrong.
3274569	3280916	Then this National Guardsman comes up and it's like, holy shit, he's getting everything in order.
3282253	3288678	immediately stands in the front of the line, gets a ticket to buy an Xbox 360, and is like, FIN FOR YOURSELVES, and leaves.
3290239	3290820	What?
3291240	3292081	That's crazy.
3292962	3294543	That's funny, is what that is.
3295484	3296705	I'd be pissed.
3296765	3298326	I want to let Extover do his thing.
3298346	3300788	We'll go back to the 360 in a little bit, but Extover's back in the room.
3301148	3302890	Do you have an important phone call you had to take?
3303510	3306253	I did have an important... Was it a hookup call?
3306273	3308135	It was definitely not a hookup call.
3308155	3308595	Booty call?
3308915	3309116	No.
3309336	3309716	Oh, okay.
3309836	3310497	Was it a family call?
3310517	3311037	Is everything okay?
3311158	3312199	No, everything's fine.
3312479	3313640	You seem kind of bunned out tonight.
3313780	3314541	Is everything okay?
3314581	3315642	I'm just, like, tired.
3315722	3316323	Do you need a hug?
3317243	3317944	Um, no.
3317964	3318885	Don't touch me.
3319105	3319606	Alright, I won't.
3319666	3320026	I'm kidding.
3322588	3324189	How was your week, Extover?
3325170	3327092	My week was fine.
3327212	3329453	It was like Thanksgiving and stuff.
3330194	3337279	Saw my family and went and saw Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire again.
3337359	3340822	Liked it a lot better than the first time that I saw it.
3341142	3342323	I need to go see that again.
3343149	3344910	Are you going to see that four times in the theater?
3345010	3345931	I can.
3347772	3351795	Oh, and it's the fourth movie, so you'll see it four times in the theater.
3351936	3352256	Get it?
3353337	3354758	That's really retarded.
3354798	3355838	Don't say that again.
3356419	3356659	All right.
3356959	3362263	Well, I know you've got to get going soon because you and Mickey have to get on the road, but I wanted to allow you a chance to do your movie review.
3362583	3365365	Now, I know you hate your old theme music, so I changed your theme music.
3365606	3365846	Okay?
3365906	3366306	Okay.
3366366	3366606	All right.
3366866	3368488	So what movie are you going to be reviewing today?
3370676	3373038	I am going to be... What is that?
3373898	3374999	Just do your talking.
3375039	3376340	Don't worry about what's going on behind you.
3376921	3382125	I'm going to be reviewing Rent because I went and saw it yesterday with all you folks.
3383466	3398319	And basically it's a movie about late 80s people trying to make it in New York and having problems financially and dying of AIDS.
3399639	3404843	Pretty much like you said yesterday, if you don't get a job, then you'll die of AIDS.
3404903	3408785	That was my summary of the moral I learned from Rant, is that if you don't get a job, you'll die of AIDS.
3408985	3409225	Right.
3409306	3410987	Rob didn't really like it that much.
3411067	3412027	I hated Rant.
3412107	3413128	I hated it a lot.
3413388	3414009	I liked it.
3414229	3415189	I liked it quite a bit.
3415569	3419972	And I think this may be because I really just am into musicals.
3420052	3420613	I love them.
3421873	3423094	I like the music in them.
3423555	3425296	It was poignant.
3425396	3427397	It had some really good moments in it.
3427517	3428318	Is that because you're gay?
3428758	3430540	No way, I'm gay and I didn't like it.
3431321	3435104	No, I don't think that liking musicals is a gay or straight thing.
3435865	3439969	I mean, you can be a musical lover.
3440349	3442011	My mom's straight and she loves musicals.
3442251	3442572	Right.
3443913	3444934	Bad example, Rob.
3445254	3446495	Okay.
3446996	3447937	I like musicals.
3448410	3449471	They're very fun.
3449731	3451232	I like musicals, I just don't like red.
3452033	3454775	I know, as I heard many a time.
3456056	3457196	No, it was good though.
3457296	3457857	I liked it.
3457997	3458918	I really enjoyed it.
3460399	3461880	And there you go.
3462961	3463801	So two thumbs up?
3464221	3467344	Two cocks up and a limp cock.
3468244	3470286	Use protection, or you might catch something.
3471467	3472547	Right.
3472627	3474309	Or else your cocks will die of AIDS.
3475389	3477251	And make sure your cocks get a job.
3478422	3479082	Please get a job.
3479102	3480083	A blowjob.
3480603	3481284	Okay, I'm off.
3481324	3482845	And careful not to sell out to the man.
3483705	3484766	Yeah, don't do that.
3485306	3487107	Don't sell out to the man.
3487347	3487908	Final thoughts?
3489329	3491090	Go see Rent.
3491770	3492150	No, don't.
3492210	3493811	You may like it or you may not.
3495212	3495492	All right.
3496613	3502396	Get Miklatov back in here so he can say his goodbyes too because I know you guys are leaving soon.
3502917	3504457	Oh, Miklatov.
3505198	3506739	Is he out there somewhere?
3507941	3508802	Live Radio Kids.
3509703	3511504	We're not in an actual studio, by the way.
3511544	3515448	This is the spare bedroom in the apartment that Extrovert and I live in.
3516749	3518570	It's quite a nifty apartment.
3519111	3521153	Alright, give that mic back to Loki.
3521233	3522534	Alright, back to the 360.
3522634	3523254	Yeah.
3524215	3525837	What's the status on your 360 now?
3525897	3529280	You pre-ordered your 360 back in, remind me when this was, like June?
3529420	3529660	August.
3529940	3530260	August.
3530901	3531702	And still no dice.
3533142	3534623	I'm on the first page, halfway down.
3535604	3539746	They said, though, that I will probably get mine before Christmas.
3540186	3549091	And I'm guessing, they're saying, someone said in the chatroom that 14 units are going to each store each week or whatever, so if that's the case, I'll probably get mine probably in two weeks.
3549151	3556495	Well, why would 14 go to the Ma and Pa shop and bumfuck, you know, North Dakota, but then 14 go to Best Buy?
3556515	3561758	Okay, well that's... I don't think, no one knows until they get the stupid shipments in, so...
3562718	3565260	Do we know anything about future shipments of Xbox 360s?
3565280	3566701	Because that's what I think is interesting.
3587825	3588305	Big deal.
3588406	3591448	Yeah, they sold out so that their drive-up hype, they did that.
3591688	3594871	Why would you drive up hype if you're not going to replenish the market?
3594951	3595852	So it only makes sense.
3596232	3598254	You know, I have an interesting story to share real quick.
3598274	3604519	I know you've got to get going soon, so I want to give you a chance to say your final thought and any other things you want to say to the listeners.
3604892	3606795	Brokeback Mountain is the best thing ever.
3606815	3607275	Go buy it.
3607355	3608136	It's only like $10.
3608196	3609138	Go buy the soundtrack.
3609378	3610399	Go see the movie if you can.
3619764	3632552	If you like the notion of people buttfucking and spitting on their cocks and having that as a lubricant, then go see Bareback Mountain.
3634714	3639637	You know, this is like an Oscar caliber film they're trying to put this out as, and you're turning it into a porno.
3641596	3644037	I had a friend on Live Channel.
3663264	3666847	And I know this person doesn't listen to the show, so I'm okay to talk about this.
3666907	3669408	And it's behind a friend's lockpost anyway, so none of you would know who it is.
3670009	3671890	And I told him I don't know how I feel about this.
3671950	3674392	This is somebody, he's not a gamer in any capacity.
3674412	3676073	I mean, I think he's like a casual thing.
3676333	3680336	You know how most people our age have probably played Mario Brothers once in their life?
3680356	3681056	You know, that's about it.
3681417	3683298	But by no means a hardcore gamer.
3683898	3686360	He rounded up a team of individuals.
3686660	3688502	They got, I think, eight people or something.
3688602	3690503	And they managed to get nine people.
3690723	3695324	Platinum Xbox systems on launch day because they all camped out at least 24 hours in advance.
3695645	3697985	So they all got nine Platinum Xboxes.
3699446	3701006	They sold all the systems on eBay.
3702146	3708308	And they gave each person that stood out in line and helped them out $1,000 for their help.
3708468	3709789	And they were very happy for $1,000 for their help.
3710970	3722923	and they still had after that left over I think something like $8,000 that they put $5,000 away for the baby's education because they have a new baby on the way and the other $3,000 they just spent on themselves.
3724079	3749783	I don't know what I think about this because I think you're taking advantage of people but at the same time I blame the people that actually bid that much on eBay and allow you to think that this is a viable option for making money and I'm happy that as kids because they're going to invest the money and I know they will I know they will be smart with their money and invest the money and they will be able to send this baby to a
3750678	3753860	Really great school, all based on these Xbox 360 sales.
3754080	3756421	But as a gamer, I can't help but think, you bastard.
3757382	3758202	I wanted one of those.
3758882	3762884	They're taking advantage on the desperation and relative stupidity of other people.
3763245	3764905	But who's to blame in that scenario?
3765366	3765766	I don't know.
3765986	3767187	They were well within their rights.
3768327	3770648	I think, you know, it's hard for me to put the blame on them.
3770768	3771889	I think they are within their rights.
3771929	3772969	They are smart.
3773050	3774210	They put the work into it.
3774250	3777772	They put it online knowing that there were going to be morons out there who'd bid on them.
3778160	3779020	I know.
3779721	3780081	I don't know.
3780121	3783402	I believe the idiot masses should be exploited.
3783422	3787104	I just can't believe somebody would pay like $3,000.
3787604	3788985	And they got it.
3789025	3790766	They got like $3,100 for each of these systems.
3790826	3791466	It was crazy.
3792887	3793407	Crazy, crazy.
3795350	3795950	What can I say there?
3796070	3796571	People are dumb.
3796631	3798732	But, you know, like I said, I'm just waiting.
3799252	3817761	But if I do find one in a store, you know, if Best Buy is getting, you know, 90 in each shipment or whatever, and there's some sitting there, of course I'm going to buy one because, you know, I can have it now and I still have my, I can get my, you know, money back from my, you know, deposit on it and whatever.
3817821	3818921	I mean, it's no big deal.
3819322	3823844	But, I mean, no, I'm really, when I look at the games and the four games that I got for it,
3824870	3827812	I looked at, once I got those four games, I still had like $70 in store credit.
3827852	3829333	I'm like, what do I buy now?
3829974	3832156	And I looked at the list of everything that's coming out.
3832176	3833697	I'm like, I don't want any of this.
3834317	3835578	And that's kind of what it is.
3835598	3842263	See, that's what's scaring me away from buying an Xbox 360 right now, is I really don't feel like... I think it's going to be the same thing with regular Xbox.
3842343	3845586	I had no reason to buy a regular Xbox until...
3846499	3852061	Halo, Willy, and even Halo, I wasn't a fan of Halo when I first played it, but I converted.
3852402	3853702	It's a first-person shooter I enjoy.
3854002	3855523	You need to see Perfect Dark Zero.
3856283	3857424	I do want to see Xbox 360.
3857704	3860685	It's all about Perfect Dark Zero.
3860745	3862046	Okay, well, I need to be talking to you.
3862146	3866928	As an Xbox 360 owner, which you and the hubby got one of these systems, right?
3867148	3867228	No.
3867268	3868108	I told you we didn't.
3868389	3870450	Oh, I thought... I told you we decided not to.
3870610	3872030	I know, but then I thought you went back and you did.
3872410	3873591	No, we went and played somebody else's.
3874271	3875612	And now we're going to get one next week.
3876273	3876533	Okay.
3876593	3878514	Because we are going to get one next week.
3878734	3879195	Gotcha.
3879295	3880215	Okay, now it makes sense.
3880315	3882737	Okay, so you didn't end up getting one, but you played somebody else's.
3882777	3883357	So what did you think?
3883517	3885559	I've only played the demo kiosk.
3885579	3886619	I haven't played an actual system yet.
3886639	3888781	There's a point where games can be too pretty.
3889682	3892004	and Project Gotham 3 is too pretty.
3892104	3893926	The cars look like they float over the ground.
3894607	3898772	However, you do actually start off with performance vehicles as opposed to just eye candy.
3900974	3905259	Like one of your first cars you can pick from is the Saleen Mustang or the...
3908658	3912920	New Shelby, which actually isn't even going to be out on the market to purchase until next year.
3913841	3917203	Now, did you play this on like a widescreen HD type setup?
3917223	3919864	I played it on an HD TV, but nowhere near as huge as mine.
3920144	3921605	But still, I bet it was very pretty.
3922085	3923506	It was pretty, but it was too pretty.
3923666	3926048	I mean, like I said, the cursor, they were floating over the ground.
3926408	3927929	It does have good music in it, though.
3928709	3929950	Some really good original music.
3931151	3932512	Perfect Dark Zero was gorgeous.
3932933	3934374	The levels are humongous.
3935495	3938337	And there's lots of opportunity to shoot people.
3938537	3941339	Wait till you see Ghost Recon 3.
3942080	3942680	Oh my god.
3942781	3944162	Actually, I wasn't too interested in it.
3944382	3944862	He had it.
3945082	3946624	It was boring.
3946764	3947584	What about Condemned?
3947604	3948425	Because I remember you liked it.
3948445	3949426	Did you get a chance to play Condemned yet?
3949446	3950006	It didn't have it.
3950347	3951808	Because I remember you liked that one at E3.
3952488	3953349	It didn't have it.
3954090	3955971	Maybe that was the Sega fangirl in you that liked it.
3955991	3956292	I don't know.
3957112	3983708	I'm looking forward to it I'm still going to get it I've got Waiting for Perfect Dark and I'm probably going to do maybe Condemned Ridge Racer if they send me a free copy But the other one we also there was another game they had there too No, it was the whatever that war game was Call of Duty Call of Duty, that was it Call of Duty was kind of boring
3984668	3986329	It was pretty, but it's kind of boring.
3987249	3992052	You know, the weird thing is that the two games I want most on the Xbox 360, I can get on another platform.
3992372	3993172	Quake 4 and Gun.
3993553	3999896	Oh, Need for Speed Most Wanted, having compared the Xbox version and the 360... Actually, this is coming from Dan.
4000336	4007499	He compared the Xbox version, which he's been playing non-stop, and the 360 version, and said that actually the Xbox version plays better.
4008660	4012342	The 360 version is apparently a slower game.
4013896	4023341	I've already bought Soul Calibur 3 for PlayStation.
4024022	4025643	I have this bad feeling they're going to do it.
4025663	4026843	Why are you so sure they're not going to do it?
4027664	4028084	Why not?
4028164	4029044	Milk more money out of us.
4029505	4031206	No, they've said they're not going to.
4031566	4033707	That was a rumor that was going around about it, and they said no.
4034247	4034667	Why not?
4035308	4036128	That's stupid.
4036188	4036849	Why wouldn't they do it?
4037409	4039590	Because it's exclusive to Sony.
4039910	4040751	So was Resident Evil 4.
4041878	4044313	Sony paid for the rights to have it exclusive for...
4044790	4047911	And if that's the case, it might come out maybe next year or something like that.
4047971	4050472	Yeah, I didn't say it's going to come out tomorrow.
4050913	4062397	It would come out months after it's announced, but I bet you Soul Calibur 3 would end up getting released for the Xbox 360 outside of Sony's exclusive window, and it's going to have two new characters or something good that's going to make us all want to go buy it.
4062437	4066139	And I'm going to be pissed, because I already have it on PS2, but it's going to be prettier on Xbox 360.
4066179	4066879	Well, here's the thing.
4066999	4073282	Gun, I would recommend getting it on the current-gen systems, because the 360 is not worth the $10 extra you're paying for.
4073302	4074322	It's the same damn game.
4074962	4076243	No prettier graphics or anything?
4076804	4079085	The texture resolution is a little bit higher.
4079125	4081267	The character models have a few more polygons.
4081407	4081747	That's it.
4082108	4083348	Not like night and day.
4083529	4086571	It's not like, you know, Call of Duty 2 and Big Red 1.
4086651	4090514	There's major differences between those.
4090574	4097118	As far as Quake 4, I heard that there's problems with the frame rate in Quake 4 making it unplayable in parts because it's so slow on the 360.
4097158	4097359	Really?
4099720	4104064	Why didn't... These kind of mistakes kind of just ruffle my feathers.
4104244	4110469	I mean, and you hear about the Xboxes crashing and everything, and it's like, if it isn't completely fucking obvious that you rushed to get this out on the market.
4110489	4115073	360, they said, I've read so many things about why it's crashing and overheating and stuff.
4115533	4119036	One of them, they said there's vent holes in them that some of them are getting punched out.
4120017	4121418	I didn't get to see the BSOD.
4123440	4124101	Oh, the blue screen.
4124161	4124921	The black screen of death.
4128534	4132918	The power supply overheats and you have to put it on something that gets proper ventilation?
4133138	4133939	You have that problem.
4134559	4141886	They're overheating more commonly when they're kept inside of an entertainment cabinet.
4142026	4142466	Oh, I see.
4142486	4143027	I can see that.
4143928	4146510	Because I bet you in a testing environment they don't mimic that.
4146704	4149086	They're so big because they have a giant fan inside of them.
4149387	4150047	It's retarded.
4150548	4154672	I mean, put this stupid thing on the system and forget about it.
4155092	4157215	The hard drive they said is overheating.
4157335	4159137	Just a lot of heat problems.
4160178	4163481	But then they're also saying, oh, it scratches disks and stuff.
4164062	4171428	Yeah, when you knock it over, like anything, if you're playing a CD and you knock the damn thing over, obviously it's going to scratch your stupid CD.
4172729	4176552	It's retarded, but that's one other thing that was going wrong with it.
4176572	4183978	Problems with the hard drive being able to read stuff, just problems like that.
4184259	4187161	It's widespread, and I haven't heard issues about live or anything.
4187777	4188778	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4204938	4210640	And one of our podcast listeners also stated that you can actually play your iPod in-game.
4211860	4212801	Oh, that's kind of cool.
4213241	4214121	Play music in-game.
4214821	4215841	And it comes out over your TV.
4217142	4217342	Yeah.
4217622	4219322	That's kind of an interesting little perk.
4219342	4220843	You just can't rip stuff from...
4221696	4222977	Thank you for watching!
4239468	4239708	All right.
4240228	4242049	Well, so I don't know.
4242429	4247371	Me personally, Xbox 360, I think I'm going to end up waiting until next year to see some more games that are coming out.
4247471	4249372	I was totally sold on getting one at launch.
4249972	4253654	And had they been readily available everywhere, the impulse firing me probably would have done it.
4253914	4254114	Yeah.
4254234	4256034	So I'm kind of glad they weren't available everywhere.
4256475	4259196	I'm buying Gans for his birthday next week.
4259416	4260576	That's a little different.
4260596	4261597	Birthday, Christmas, you know.
4261677	4262557	And my husband.
4262797	4264758	I was staring down some of those core systems and stuff.
4264818	4267678	And for example, there's another, there's websites out there where you can still get a 360.
4269159	4278141	There's a guy that's getting in 90 next week and he's an online seller selling them for I think slightly over what retail is or something.
4278621	4278981	I don't know.
4279202	4280882	But they're out there.
4281622	4287464	Just wait until next week when the next shipment comes in and see how short they really are on these things.
4287784	4291145	And I bet you anything that's going to be, you're going to see them in stores regularly.
4291365	4291665	Because it's
4292145	4292666	What's the point?
4292786	4296729	Like I said before, driving the hype up if you're not going to replenish the supply.
4296869	4297910	There's no point to it.
4299011	4299952	And that was the whole point.
4299992	4301853	They want to make it the must-have item for Christmas.
4303024	4306566	If it's going to be the must-have item for Christmas, you've got to have some for Christmas.
4306646	4309047	Yeah, I know.
4309107	4316170	And of course, one of our chatters, Rainy, reminding us of the golden rule of gaming, a system is only as good as the games that are on it.
4316670	4318431	And that fundamentally, I think, is a problem.
4318571	4326214	Well, there are some good games for Xbox 360, but for me, my kind of games, the role-playing games and other type of games, there's just not enough.
4326758	4334083	What I'm waiting to hear is I heard that the 360, some of the games may not be region coded.
4334723	4338486	In which case, they're not sure if they're region coding everything or not.
4338766	4342709	Because if they're not, then you can import like crazy.
4342869	4343950	I heard that rumor as well.
4344090	4346772	That would be, I gotta just do away with that region coding.
4346932	4347712	PS3's doing it.
4348233	4348453	Good.
4349682	4353083	If I pay 70 bucks to import a Japanese game, then shit, I should just play it.
4353103	4354583	ESP doesn't have region-coded games.
4355523	4365245	It's about time they got rid of the... I mean, I always thought... I understood the reason behind it was to keep games per market and track them and all kinds of other stupid marketing crap.
4365565	4369186	But thanks to the internet, we live in a worldwide market now, and I think people are coming to understand that.
4369606	4371227	That's what I was going to say, actually.
4371587	4371827	I'm sorry.
4373727	4379571	What I'm thinking is, the only regions they should have are PAL and, you know, NTSC.
4379671	4380552	Well, yeah, that makes sense.
4380592	4382233	They should get rid of PAL altogether.
4382533	4387977	But doesn't, isn't it, when we move into the HDTV age, isn't it all standardized?
4388237	4388837	Or am I wrong?
4388957	4391499	It's still, maybe some tech junkies in chat know.
4391519	4396582	Technically, I've played PAL discs using my DVD player on my laptop, routed through my TV.
4397223	4397443	Hmm.
4397903	4398644	And it worked just fine.
4398844	4399004	Hmm.
4400342	4400742	Interesting.
4401002	4407426	But I'm wondering in the HDTVs, with the new HDTVs, because it's a new resolution, like basically the issue between NTSC and PAL is resolution, right?
4407826	4411768	So aren't HDTVs resolutions standardized throughout the world?
4412028	4412469	Or am I wrong?
4412709	4413409	I think they are.
4413709	4414330	I do believe so.
4414710	4415170	Then good.
4415190	4416571	It's like using a computer monitor.
4417071	4418332	Yeah, then good.
4418352	4420915	Then we're moving towards a standardized there too.
4420975	4432628	So, you know, and that would be good news for overseas people as well at some point because that's the reason why it takes them so damn long to get their games usually is because they have to redo all the resolution and stuff.
4432688	4433849	So that's good news for them.
4433909	4435771	Just do multiple languages from the start.
4435951	4436552	Boom, done.
4436832	4437132	I don't know.
4437552	4438053	We'll see what happens.
4438433	4439554	All right, we're going to do one more break.
4439594	4440754	I know we said we'd do Skype Line.
4440794	4442055	We will do that when we come back.
4442075	4444657	We're also going to do the Cage Match and anything else we feel like.
4444977	4450980	But I have to go potty, so that means, and Loki's going to beat me to it, I have to go potty, so that means we have to break.
4451360	4452381	So we'll be back after this.
4452701	4455503	In this break, we'll start it off with a little bit of Superstar.
4455963	4457444	Remember this song, Dark Sakura?
4457504	4458344	We used to love this song.
4458545	4460666	I still do, but... It used to be my PA song.
4460806	4462007	Dancing to this song was wonderful.
4462167	4463287	It used to be my PA song.
4463447	4463888	Good times.
4465269	4468313	If we actually play DDR, it might still be your PNPA song.
4468613	4468954	Maybe.
4469655	4471157	We'll be back after this with more Orange Launch Radio.
4731636	4733717	Baby, if you want to come back
4789068	4790208	Thanks for watching!
4852763	4862851	Hi-ho, Kermit the Frog here, informing you that today's broadcast of Orange Lounge Radio is brought to you by the letter V, the letter A, and the number 59.
4862891	4868256	Can you tell me how to get, how to get to Saturday night?
4868871	4872254	We're back here, boys and girls, on Orange Lounge Radio, and I hope you enjoyed that break.
4872415	4874677	A little, just some potpourri music there.
4874717	4878240	I tried to put in some stuff that I know Jamie likes that we haven't played in a while.
4878481	4885608	I'm kind of doing stuff I think Jamie likes tonight because, you know, it's been a while since she's been here and getting to dictate the picks in my ear.
4886489	4890332	But she hasn't really said a lot of songs she wants to hear tonight, so I'm playing stuff I think she'd want to hear.
4890773	4891333	Am I doing good?
4892114	4892955	So far so good.
4893035	4893655	So far so good.
4893715	4900100	In that break we heard Superstar, The Safari, because I know you love The Safari, Look to the Sky, I don't know how big you are on that song.
4900120	4901961	That was more for the listeners, because I know that's a listener favorite.
4901981	4902561	Yeah, screw them.
4902701	4905503	And Era, Taku, which we had to do.
4905783	4907324	We had to do at least one song by him.
4908425	4910447	So maybe some more Jamie-inspired stuff next break.
4910487	4917293	But for now, we're actually going to head on over to the Skype line, and if you would like to call us, please do so.
4918154	4925300	Just head on over to www.orangeloungeradio.com and click on Interact With Us.
4926121	4927922	Sorry, the program was being unruly there for a minute.
4927962	4929464	I had to figure out what's going on.
4931185	4931526	There we go.
4931546	4934228	Yes, we're up and ready to go on Skype if you guys want to call in.
4934668	4940333	Also, we have a... Oh, the Skype server might be down right now, actually, because it's still showing us it's connecting.
4940413	4942896	So we're going to have to proceed.
4942916	4945158	Okay, we're not going to take calls on Skype just yet.
4946434	4948876	Live radio can't control when the servers go up and down, boys and girls.
4948916	4953138	So let's actually head on over and see what else is going on in the Mimani world.
4953778	4957961	I mentioned earlier in the show I checked out 2DX 10th Style this week.
4958461	4960062	I don't know if either of you guys have gotten a chance to play it.
4960342	4962584	Jamie, have you really picked up 9th or 10th?
4962624	4963224	I thought you got 9th.
4963304	4963644	No.
4964625	4966246	No, you never got 9th or 10th?
4966766	4968327	It's one of those things where it's kind of getting old.
4968928	4969408	Kind of.
4970888	4971208	I don't know.
4971468	4975709	I can keep in mind, I work full time and go to school part time.
4976829	4981950	I really don't have a lot of time left over for BVMD until the end of the semester.
4982150	4982370	Right.
4982811	4985231	And I played a whole lot of 8th style over the summer.
4985451	4985691	Right.
4986311	4987932	Because I wasn't going to classes.
4988552	4992853	But I figured that I was going to wait and pick up 10th style because I refused to play 9th style.
4993573	4994093	Why 9th style?
4994946	4996810	Just because of how crappy the arcade release was.
4996850	4998754	Well, you know the timing's fine in the home version.
4998914	5001560	It's not... Yeah, but it also didn't really have much in it I liked.
5002455	5005416	You know what's funny is I have just the reverse with TenStyle.
5005476	5022478	TenStyle is put together beautifully, and the song list is okay, and it's a really great looking game, especially because they've upped the resolution from the old third, fourth styles, and it's a very sharp looking game, and it's nice, but I find that when I was playing it, I was kind of like, where's all these songs I like from NinthStyle?
5023039	5024739	See, I like NinthStyle an awful lot.
5025599	5027459	I still think Eighth has the best of all of them.
5027619	5031000	Eighth had a really solid song list, especially the arcade release, but...
5031500	5044845	I don't know, I just, I do love 9th, so as soon as I get a new controller, because we're pretty confident that the US is getting their own controller that's going to be different, and hopefully better, that's when I'll truly get back into 2DX.
5044905	5056530	But Miklosov was nice, he offered to let me borrow his 10th style and controller, because I'm supposed to be seeing him this weekend too, and he offered to let me borrow it all week so I could really test drive it, but I said, I'm going to be too busy with Dragon Quest VIII.
5057350	5061314	Well, you know, my controller still works perfectly fine and it fell off the top of the van.
5062415	5063857	I don't know how that is.
5064137	5066820	I can't, I, I, you, you have the miracle controller.
5066840	5068482	I've been through it three times.
5068542	5069783	That's, that's still something else.
5070964	5073467	I do have, my controller is indestructible.
5074188	5074508	Well, what,
5077529	5079270	I want to ask Loki about this real quick.
5079290	5085313	These are some articles you posted on the site about the portable DDR and Beatmania sim games that are out there.
5085353	5086013	What's going on with this?
5086053	5089435	I know this isn't your sim scene update, but what's going on with these PSP clones?
5090816	5096058	Well, I mentioned last week about the old DDR one, and it's pretty cool.
5096418	5101060	You get to actually... It's basically Steadmania for the PSP.
5101621	5105343	Now, the Beatmania one, not quite so much.
5105483	5105703	Like...
5107179	5108560	Beatmania for the PSP.
5108660	5114303	It's more of a two-button Beatmania because the way the buttons are mapped.
5114723	5129791	But you could actually, I guess, remap everything so that you could play songs using their corresponding keys, but I mean, with a PSP, it's kind of hard to play seven-key Beatmania on it, obviously.
5130951	5134733	I was actually installing that on my PSP right now as...
5135994	5136995	as you caught me.
5137355	5139777	But, no, it looks really good, actually.
5140017	5145041	They've got quite a setup for DDR and stuff.
5145061	5150165	This one looks like it's more of like, I don't know, Delight Delight reduplication or whatever.
5150485	5153908	Because you can do DDR in the Beatmania setup as well.
5154649	5159212	And they also have 2DX in normal Beatmania as well.
5159352	5159492	So...
5160356	5164801	I'm not really sure how that works, but it looks pretty cool.
5165782	5167424	And they've got really good skins for it.
5169626	5176974	And both of them are available on PSP Updates right now, but I think we'll be adding them maybe to the PSP site at some point.
5178216	5179237	Alright, sounds good.
5182345	5184027	I know there was something else I was dying to mention.
5184067	5184588	Oh, Strike!
5184908	5189073	There's lots of updates on DDR Strike that was going on over on DDR Freak.
5189133	5190675	Some folks had found some pictures.
5191376	5197163	Damn it, and I wish I'd gotten to this when Mikulatov was here because maybe he could have elaborated a little bit even though I know he can't say a whole lot about work stuff.
5197623	5199344	Thanks for watching!
5227623	5229705	are crossovers from DDR Extreme 2.
5230485	5234989	For instance, As the Rush Comes and Block Rockin' Beats, which we had in DDR Extreme 2.
5235449	5246358	But here's the weird thing is that they have tied them to Dance Mania releases because As the Rush Comes was on Dance Mania EX7 and Block Rockin' Beats was on Dance Mania Winters.
5247702	5250748	So I'm not sure, it's very interesting how this worked.
5250808	5257340	I don't know if, were these games chosen for the US first, or were they actually chosen for Japan, and we got them anyway because they were easy to license.
5257521	5257901	We don't know.
5259144	5262827	But also apparently the scan in the magazine or whatever it is also gives away a couple other songs.
5263107	5272594	Heaven is a Place on Earth, the German election mix from Dance Media Covers 01, and Let's Dance by David Bowie, which I think is a very sexy addition to DDR.
5272634	5273794	I can't believe we're getting David Bowie.
5273814	5274455	That is badass.
5274815	5276056	David Bowie is so hot.
5276176	5277117	And Let's Dance is a great song, too.
5277137	5278358	He's going to be in a movie with Michael Caine.
5278518	5279619	That's going to be great.
5280119	5280419	Can't wait.
5281180	5283021	And then You Sexy Thing by Hot Chocolate.
5283041	5284022	And I can't think of what song...
5285171	5291694	I can't think of what song the, uh, You Sexy Thing is, though, but I think that's that old song from, uh, um, You Sexy Thing.
5294316	5295877	I don't think I remember hearing that song.
5295897	5296717	Do you know who did it?
5297658	5302140	Uh, I remember, like, the line on it, but I don't remember how the song goes.
5302580	5305762	It just must be because I have completely different tastes than that.
5305822	5306602	I have no idea.
5307063	5313626	Well, it's good to see that this game isn't just going to be a rehash of DDR Extreme 2 like I was thinking it was going to be, but, uh,
5314212	5314772	I don't know.
5314792	5315673	New stuff's always good.
5316253	5320076	Well, I think what's also interesting is that there's some crossovers from Ultramix 2.
5320336	5323738	At least one, which we can kind of infer because there's going to be one.
5323778	5324879	There will be more than one.
5325479	5331563	Baile La Samba, which was a Konami original for Ultramix 2, is crossing over.
5331583	5334084	And that was picked off from one of the Mission Mode screens.
5334104	5338027	A very observant person on DDR Freak noticed that the banners match up.
5338367	5340508	So Baile La Samba is going to be there as well.
5340548	5342469	So that is starting speculation as to...
5343670	5346492	Might we see some of the freebie songs?
5346572	5350394	Because as you know, a different drum sort of gave songs to Konami.
5350754	5353115	Not really had them licensed, but gave them for the exposure.
5353135	5355797	And that's where we got Skulk and Superstar.
5356037	5360239	So it would be very, very interesting if some of these songs showed up in the Japanese mix.
5360339	5361560	I think that would be kind of cool for them.
5361620	5362881	That would be.
5363021	5369044	I think for sure they will get Gyruss and probably the Midi Head mix and some of the other stuff.
5369064	5370565	They'll probably get all that crap for sure.
5370585	5372246	I don't see how they couldn't get that stuff.
5372591	5380794	Well, also, when you think about it, was it Festival had Ultramix One stuff in it, so it only makes sense that they would do that.
5380934	5386137	Yeah, I think a lot of people, this really isn't surprising anyone, but it's kind of cool, nonetheless.
5389958	5391339	And what else we got going on with Strike?
5391439	5404703	Then this came up later in the thread is that somebody actually got a screenshot and knew enough Japanese to kind of translate the little tiny stuff that shows up there on the side and notices that there is no online mode for the Japanese DDR Strike release.
5406884	5407644	Interesting.
5407704	5410745	I don't know if that's because DDR they don't think is popular over there.
5410805	5411206	I'm not sure.
5411246	5413726	I'm not sure what to think of this, why they're not doing the online mode.
5413746	5415127	Or maybe it's just an early screenshot.
5415147	5415487	Who knows?
5415587	5417808	Or maybe because the Extreme 2 online sucked?
5420177	5420758	That's true, too.
5420778	5422279	Doesn't it have bugs, too?
5422319	5423820	Aren't people still cheating on there and stuff?
5424541	5425702	It sucked, apparently.
5426462	5428124	Compared to the Xbox One, it does suck.
5428164	5442396	It's too bad that Extreme 2 came out later, but I realize there's a lot of anti-Microsoft people, for lack of a better term, people that don't have Xboxes for financial, just don't want to, whatever reasons, that haven't gotten to experience the Xbox Live.
5442416	5443277	And I'll tell you what, guys.
5444159	5449343	I used to be anti-Microsoft too, and in some circumstances I still am to some extent.
5449583	5460891	I don't like some of the things they do, but I've come to accept, embrace some of the things that are really great about Xbox, one of them being they have advanced videos, or the other one being that they
5461391	5465053	have the best online system that kicks PS2's butt.
5465393	5470355	I mean, Xbox Live kicks anything else's butt, basically, right now that's out there in the console world.
5470735	5476818	And so, to go and play DDR on the Xbox Live, and then go to play it on Extreme 2, you're like, yeah, this sucks.
5477339	5484342	But I bet for people that have never played Xbox Live, they probably don't know that it can be a lot better, so it works out just fine for them.
5484802	5486143	So, I don't know.
5486183	5487543	Still kind of interesting that they left it out.
5488604	5488944	Who knows?
5491164	5493008	Of course, more to come still on this game.
5493048	5494551	We will see what happens a little later.
5494591	5496575	I'm sure there are surprises still left in store.
5497417	5497738	Who knows?
5499764	5501085	Skype is doing some weird stuff with me, guys.
5501105	5506470	That's going to be too bad if we have to do a show without Skype, because I'd love to hear from our listeners.
5506510	5508151	We'd love to hear what they have to say.
5523496	5524577	Let's try this one more time here.
5524597	5525657	We're going to try connecting there.
5526418	5528539	And yeah, I got booted again.
5529099	5529559	That's great.
5530020	5535363	Okay, so we're going to go ahead and actually we're going to go into the cage match for right now and try to get some time for Skype to come back up.
5535723	5537604	And we'll go to the Skype line a little later in the show.
5538004	5539465	And I'm sorry guys, I don't know what's happening there.
5539485	5540826	I'm having timeout problems.
5540886	5542127	Some of you might be on it.
5542747	5544308	We're just having some problems here in studio.
5544348	5547430	So I'm going to try some other things here while we go into the cage match.
5547510	5551632	But it is time to get into this week's cage match.
5554403	5558445	Now the nice thing about CageMatch is that we don't need our Skype line for CageMatch, we only need the chatroom.
5558786	5564629	So you gotta be in our chatroom if you want to vote in CageMatch, and that's www.orangeloundtrader.com and click on chat.
5565509	5571893	And the way CageMatch works is that we're going to play three songs for you guys, and your favorite song will go into rotation all week long.
5572373	5575634	on Orange Lounge Radio's Bomani and Video Game Music program.
5576075	5577395	And we had a winning song last week.
5577435	5579796	It was a brand new winner, and it was something that Loki picked.
5580436	5583837	And the song was by John Sykes, and it was called Cautionary Warning.
5584698	5586598	And anything else you want to say about this song, Loki?
5587739	5588239	Your mic's off.
5588779	5589700	It's just a really cool song.
5589960	5590180	Okay.
5590680	5591060	Here it is.
5591180	5594201	A clip of last week's winner, John Sykes, with Cautionary Warning.
5594942	5595582	And here's a clip.
5604257	5604948	Thanks for watching!
5656181	5658063	Thank you for watching, and I'll see you next time.
5711457	5716944	Alright, that was song number one in tonight's cage match, a clip of last week's winner, John Sykes, Cautionary Warning.
5717284	5722150	Wasn't that, now I'm remembering that song, that's the one where the White Snake guitarist or something has something to do with that, right?
5722590	5722811	Loki?
5725622	5726342	That's very correct.
5726362	5726722	Alright.
5727223	5727583	Interesting.
5727603	5727963	Alright.
5728484	5730285	Song number two in tonight's K-Twitch will be my pick.
5730305	5731346	I'm going to go ahead and go.
5732186	5735929	My song is... Too bad Miklatel's not here because he talked this song up for me.
5736309	5738090	But my song is by an artist named Andy Bell.
5738451	5739992	And Andy Bell was half of Razor.
5740492	5743134	You know, the great 80s and 90s synth-pop band.
5743194	5743894	I love synth-pop.
5744335	5746396	And Andy Bell has a solo album out now.
5747037	5748017	And it's pretty cool.
5748117	5751380	I like... I had to put in...
5754699	5755601	Fuckin' mic, I hit this mic.
5755841	5757243	You know I love me some synth pop.
5757944	5763033	So I had to put this in because Andy Bell is one of the granddaddies of synth pop going back to Yaz and all these other great bands.
5763373	5764154	I love this song.
5764194	5765577	It's the latest CD, Electric Blue.
5765617	5766999	It's song number two in tonight's cage match.
5767319	5768702	Crazy, here on Orange Lounge Radio.
6004451	6006193	Okay, that was song number two in tonight's Cage Mesh.
6006233	6007834	It was Andy Bell with Crazy.
6008174	6010296	And we'll go around and see what folks thought of that.
6010396	6012738	If they were crazy for that song or it drove them crazy.
6013199	6014260	DarkSakura, you're up first.
6016061	6020485	It was... no offense, it was a little repetitive.
6020585	6021126	I didn't write it.
6021646	6022066	Oh, no.
6022427	6023448	It was okay.
6023508	6024509	It wasn't a bad song.
6025069	6028532	But I just find it a little repetitive and kind of boring, so it gets a 6.5.
6030874	6032255	I've been blasting this song in my car all week.
6032315	6032955	I really like it.
6033355	6033475	Uh, 9.
6034176	6034496	Loki.
6034656	6036417	That's so crazy.
6037037	6037637	I'll hold 7.5.
6037737	6039879	Okay.
6040379	6043400	Alright, moving on to song number 3 in tonight's Gage Match.
6043480	6045281	DarkSakura, what'd you pick for us?
6046022	6054206	Um, because it's that Saturday, which is usually the day I think about what I'm gonna play, um, I just picked the Blur song, so it's a crazy beat.
6055468	6057274	Alright, sound of the pre-tonight's cage match.
6057475	6057796	Blur!
6059060	6059722	Blur!
6059903	6060706	With Crazy Beat.
6060886	6061107	Enjoy.
6114122	6117545	I love my brothers on Saturday night
6155109	6168279	I love my sister and I love her tonight Break out!
6193937	6197080	I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know
6239553	6241456	Thank you for watching!
6257938	6260500	Okay, that was song number three in tonight's cage match.
6260560	6262802	That was Blur with Crazy Beat.
6263303	6266465	Once again, are you crazy about that song or did it drive you crazy?
6266505	6267366	DarkSakura.
6267526	6270149	It's actually not my favorite Blur song, but I like it.
6270949	6275453	Um, so, uh, give it an 8.5.
6277335	6278536	Kicks and Butts Kicks and Butts
6292910	6314428	7.5
6316991	6317371	I don't know.
6317391	6318271	I don't know.
6318331	6320532	Are you listening to tonight's K-Town songs, Loki?
6320552	6322352	Yes, I am listening to K-Town.
6322712	6325053	I just thought it would be funny since both songs have crazy.
6325073	6326333	Yeah, I know.
6326413	6328894	It was interesting that both songs have crazy in the title.
6328914	6330394	Just one of those funky coincidences.
6330874	6333955	Well, alright, it's time for you guys to vote as soon as we recap.
6333995	6340116	Here we go, the three songs you can vote for tonight, starting off with song number one, which is Cautionary Warning.
6348647	6362567	And song number two you can vote for tonight is Andy Bell with Crazy And song number three you can vote for tonight is Blur with Crazy Beat
6370918	6372359	All right, kids, you know what to do.
6372399	6374020	Place vote now.
6374100	6381204	Send a private message to Sky in the chat room with your vote, and we will reveal the wiener of the vote as soon as we can.
6381985	6389750	Moving on over to Loki to talk about what else is going on in the sim scene besides the PSP thing, which, by the way, you actually showed me because you downloaded it there during the last little bit.
6389850	6390350	It's pretty cool.
6390390	6391551	That actually looks kind of neat.
6391951	6396474	The skin's a little fucked because your life bar's in the middle of the screen, but, well, there's four skins.
6396534	6398615	I haven't tried the other four skins.
6400067	6401923	I walked right into that joke, okay.
6403104	6405485	No, there's supposedly four different skins for it.
6406426	6410867	It's weird, though, because you can do DDR and stuff, but I haven't actually tried some of the other skins.
6411848	6413709	I've been basically using a default one.
6413969	6416830	I don't really know it's the life bar in the middle, so it's not a big problem for me.
6417731	6423833	The keys, though, are a little fucked up, but I probably should have not been trying to play one key P1807.
6425534	6427075	That just didn't work very well.
6427595	6429436	You had one key assigned to all your buttons?
6429476	6430056	What was that about?
6430556	6432478	Well, that's the default settings they have.
6432498	6434939	Because try doing 7-key on a PSP.
6435700	6437901	Well, then why point the damn thing to a PSP?
6438662	6439202	I don't know.
6439643	6441444	But 5-key, though, works pretty well.
6441804	6445127	So I am getting some nice 5-key sim files to try on it.
6446107	6448089	Because, I don't know, it could work for that.
6449960	6453065	Other than that, there is some stuff going on.
6453165	6463340	I know on BomaniStyle right now they are actually doing OSC4, which is another SimFile contest, not to be confused with...
6464421	6466001	Turny Mix, which is not going on anymore.
6466662	6470682	But, anyways, OSC 4, I believe, is available for download right now.
6471403	6472223	You can check it out.
6472763	6482225	They've got some links on their front page there, and they also kind of talk about who's judging and how it's going to go and that type of stuff.
6482725	6484105	So, check it out now.
6484245	6487906	It's the keyboard division, so these are all going to be the ones that are impossible to play, so...
6489878	6490438	Check those out.
6490538	6491899	Not you, we're laughing in the chat room.
6492419	6494540	No, that's alright.
6494660	6500782	Somebody just joined and we said that they missed the cage match and their response was, and I quote, shit, shit, shitty, shit, shit.
6503143	6504524	It's the little things in life that amuse me.
6504724	6505144	Anyway, sorry.
6505204	6506905	I'm going to immortalize that.
6507825	6513928	Which, by the way, is what I think about a large part of the Bomani files that are being put out lately as shit, shit, shitty, shit, shit.
6514348	6519750	And since you mentioned shit, shit, shitty, shit, shit, I have to mention the Mac
6520165	6540240	SimFiles for the week, and starting off with Max Don't Have Sex With Your Ex, not exactly a Max Remix, but still, you know, falls under the Max category, Max 300, the Miss Remix, Max 300 Pack, which means probably more than one Max 300 in there, Max Max, Max Stinks, and Max 340.
6542239	6543120	Max Stinks?
6543760	6544500	Max Stink.
6545141	6549103	No, not Max Stinks, as in Max Stink, like Maximum Stink.
6549324	6551625	That sounds like an anti-deodorant.
6552886	6556228	Like instead of, you know, like Right Guard Max, it's Max Stink.
6557689	6559870	When you're going out on a date with an ugly.
6560050	6565174	But to be fair, what I'm going to do is I'm going to download Max Stink to my PSP and play it on the DDR simulator.
6566134	6566314	Yeah.
6567095	6568736	No, actually, no I'm not, because I'm not going to waste that.
6569497	6571339	Space on my PSP.
6572900	6587133	Now, the other thing I was kind of curious about with PSP, hypothetically, couldn't you use that little USB adapter to hypothetically use a Kiki Joy to hypothetically put in a PlayStation 2, 2DX controller?
6587513	6588213	No.
6589034	6592437	No, because the way the USB things works.
6592777	6595400	However, you could, in theory...
6596637	6601799	Put a portable keyboard which uses the infrared port and use that for Beatmania.
6602540	6603340	Now there's an idea.
6604000	6605221	Or... And then it's like that one game.
6605241	6606762	What was that Beatmania game?
6606902	6609983	Da da da or something that they put out that was a keyboard Beatmania game?
6610003	6611524	Oh my gosh.
6611769	6638458	You know what's interesting, though, is the USB port, people are saying that you can't really put stuff in there, like, you know, peripherals and stuff, but they have that new Talkpad coming out for it, and it looks like, because the problem was they couldn't get power off of the port, there was no power going through it, so that's why it's not working, but I looked at the side of this port here, and there's these two little, like, copper contact points where the power comes through, so apparently you can get power
6640517	6649642	I guess in theory you could hook up a dance pad, but why would you want to?
6650082	6652924	Just imagine for a minute, holding a PSP while you're dancing.
6654204	6657166	You know how stupid you'd look to someone who's coming by?
6659407	6660008	Seriously.
6663790	6665851	Yes, I kind of have an idea what that would look like.
6666772	6667854	I've done that with the controller before.
6683715	6684136	and many more.
6702489	6703630	Both would work, though, right?
6703650	6713059	Because the PlayStation 2 has USB on it, and like you said, the PSP has the little power thing on it, so you could use your PSP to charge your iPod, which is a really stupid idea, if you think about it, but it would work, right?
6713079	6719685	Well, the problem is that it's not a standard USB, it's the Mini-B, so you'd have to have some sort of adapter, but yes, I guess it's possible.
6720305	6725590	I don't know if power's going directly to that all the time, I don't know, but I'd imagine it has to be.
6725770	6727411	Maybe it'd have to be in USB mode for it to work.
6727431	6727792	But there's...
6728472	6735838	Like on everything, there's these copper contact points by all the AC adapter and also by the USB.
6736339	6741383	I think this is for a cradle, is why they have that there, so you can just sit it down in something.
6741643	6749569	And then, of course, the other one for the peripherals that go into it, because they have screw points where you can screw something in.
6750550	6750770	But...
6752119	6756483	Yeah, I guess you could do that, but why would you want to, honestly?
6756983	6759646	Because people will do something just because they can.
6759706	6767553	Explain why people install Linux on a Billy Bass, on a toaster, on Hello Kitty watches.
6768834	6770115	Why do people do that, Loki?
6770195	6771176	Because they can.
6773548	6779696	Seriously, I mean, if you figure out that you can charge your iPod using your PSP or whatever, aren't you going to show that to somebody?
6779756	6783400	Like, dude, I can charge my iPod with my PSP.
6783861	6785383	That's cool.
6785403	6787906	You never hear me say that because I'll never have an iPod.
6787926	6790028	I guess, I don't know.
6794039	6795120	All right.
6795520	6797101	Here's the status with Skype, you guys.
6797121	6809009	We're trying to get into Skype, but the weird thing is whenever we try, and I realize I hear you guys in the chat room loud and clear saying you see us online, but I've tried calling the back number, the phone number that you can call to get into us too, and it's not working.
6809129	6810590	It's not ringing on our computer.
6810650	6812932	So even if you guys tried to call us, we are not seeing it.
6813292	6816216	So even though you guys are seeing us logged in Skype, we are not actually there.
6816537	6824688	We are trying to log in, but the problem is I'm getting caught in a loop on Skype is that I log in and then it says logging in and then kicks me back out to the login screen.
6824708	6825769	So I don't know what's going on.
6826450	6830696	Usually what I would do is I would just reset Skype or reinstall Skype to get this to work.
6830956	6831376	DarkSakura.com
6849224	6864059	at least we have the chat room if nothing else because we do want to hear what our listeners have to say and I want to hear about your thanksgivings and stuff very sorry about Skype but this is one of those things where it's kind of out of our ballpark right now so we'll keep trying I'm going to keep trying to hammer in there and clear some stuff out and see what I can do
6865800	6867101	I can't wait for Animal Crossing
6885566	6886687	You played it, how?
6887227	6887387	At E3?
6887627	6888428	At E3?
6888728	6894090	Well, okay, so E3 answers some questions about it, but it doesn't tell us how online is going to work.
6894130	6895111	That's really what I'm curious about.
6895431	6898713	Can I go into DarkSakura's village and cut down all her trees?
6900120	6903004	If you want DarkSakura to go into your village and set fire to it.
6904065	6910994	Am I going to be able to go into DarkSakura's village and teach all of her villagers to say, you smell like butt?
6911635	6915660	Hey, you had Olivia in my village.
6916321	6918603	I was saying something rather foul.
6918683	6920065	It was cunt, ladies and gentlemen.
6920085	6920865	The word was cunt.
6921085	6934858	I was sophomoric and juvenile, and I thought it was funny to get one of my Animal Crossing villagers to say cunt, but... It's hot at two... One of them moved into my... No, she moved into your village, and then I got her back, because she was my favorite.
6934938	6935779	And she was foul.
6935799	6938821	She was going around foul-mouthed, and then her neighbors started saying it, too.
6939830	6948175	I don't remember who moved to my town, Big Cock, but it was funny everybody talking about Big Cock all the time.
6948635	6949575	We had Danville.
6951777	6952457	Because of Dan.
6953237	6953838	Oh yeah, I remember that.
6953858	6954538	You had Danville.
6954678	6956679	I don't even remember what I called my town.
6957019	6958680	It was Sky Place?
6958700	6959461	I don't remember what it was.
6960221	6960701	That's sad.
6960741	6961142	I like Big Cock.
6961162	6961422	I like that.
6967711	6969974	We have Rob on air saying that he likes it.
6970054	6970495	Shut up.
6970815	6971136	Shut up.
6971756	6974320	I hate you.
6981448	6982469	Wow, that was scary.
6982489	6987910	That didn't get all picked up on microphone, but Jamie went from laughing to like, ah!
6990811	6991711	There she goes, sorry.
6992051	6992911	Anyway.
6993211	6995132	You try coughing up balloon cookies.
6995152	6996752	See how loquacious it makes you.
6996992	7002674	Here's what I remember about Animal Crossing is that I got that Olivia to say cunt, and she went back to your village.
7003094	7007955	Then she went over to Iguana Girl's village, and those of you that know Iguana Girl knows that she hates cunts.
7008135	7009256	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
7035500	7037601	I don't remember I had the lesbian in my village too
7054895	7056796	Yeah, there was lesbians.
7057036	7062780	I don't remember what she was, but she was a lesbian because she lived in the gym teacher house and wore sweats all the time.
7063340	7065561	So I put a big rainbow sign outside of her house.
7067482	7071064	I remember you put the big rainbow sign and then you got her to say something like, you know, Big Dyke.
7071245	7072625	No, I don't remember what it was.
7072765	7076848	I thought we got her to say Real Gay or something.
7080170	7080730	That's great.
7082611	7083872	We are thinking now, I am...
7086309	7093513	Oh, cool, they're saying in the new Animal Crossing you can teach outright phrases to animals rather than just sentence fragments and words.
7093533	7096755	So I can teach my village lesbian to say that, never mind.
7097736	7098836	I eat, never mind.
7099577	7102379	If I say it, somebody's going to YTM and do it, so I can't do it.
7104260	7106301	I fear our listener base all of a sudden.
7107856	7110817	Although I do love the idea of like an Orange Lounge Radio Village.
7110877	7111877	I don't know how we're going to do it.
7111957	7113458	I guess it'll just have to be one of our towns.
7113498	7118199	We will open up during the show and just let our listeners randomly come in and harass us during Orange Lounge.
7118339	7122761	We'll have to recreate ourselves in Animal Crossing form and have our houses.
7122801	7123141	Totally.
7123221	7124521	Or maybe we'll come to your village.
7124761	7128163	That could be the thing is that Orange Lounge Radio, we could party crash your village.
7128243	7132964	Maybe like once a week somebody will give us a friend code and we'll go party crash in their village and destroy things.
7133104	7135285	It'll be Orange Lounge Radio, burn and eat your village.
7136505	7136925	I like this.
7136945	7137665	This could be like a contest.
7137685	7137986	That'd be great.
7138026	7145868	We could have contests, you know, who could hit, you know, Loki with a bug net first, or... We also have them put out welcome signs.
7146829	7148729	Yeah, we'll have... Make us shirts.
7150310	7153771	Purchase our... Too bad you can't, like, sell stuff to other players.
7154131	7157253	You know, on my Mario Kart 64...
7159401	7167242	I used, because I suck at creating emblems, I used the little pre-made t-shirt one and I just wrote OLR on it, it was my first emblem, but I'm like, that's stupid.
7167582	7171723	And then like when I would get into matches randomly on the internet, I know nobody's going to know what that means.
7172103	7175784	So now mine is a big orange heart and it says in the heart, I can't draw.
7177924	7179104	I wrote, I can't draw.
7180085	7183785	Mine I actually went and did an old logo that I had designed.
7184125	7188546	I was going to do, I wanted to get some skull and crossbones on there too, but I just stuck with Loki.
7189884	7194145	Did you see the VG cat earlier talking about the logo on the car and it says, it's a penis?
7194165	7195565	I'm going to link that to the chat room.
7217079	7217419	Please do.
7217639	7217900	It's good.
7236294	7241641	Or, you know, maybe we'll just have to rely on our quick wit to fill some show.
7242602	7243544	So we'll see what happens.
7244725	7249412	In this break, I want to do a little bit of bequia, because I need some Korean music.
7250173	7251074	So we're going to do bequia.
7251094	7252616	We'll be back after this with more Orange Laundry.
7363291	7375860	I came in from a rainy Thursday on the avenue Thought I heard you talking softly I turned on the lights, the TV, and the radio Still I can't escape the ghost of you What is happening?
7434054	7434583	and more.
7463483	7464228	Thanks for watching!
7528764	7529605	Thanks for watching!
7562293	7563654	Thank you for watching!
7599967	7601550	Don't lie on paradise!
7601590	7603493	Do you like it or hate it?
7603734	7605196	It's all up to you!
7605216	7608802	The blue one will take you for a clarion!
7643800	7644220	Hello?
7645000	7645281	Hello?
7645321	7646021	Is this thing on?
7646081	7646581	Testing.
7647761	7648642	Testing 1-2.
7649202	7653143	I'm looking in the index, but I don't see anything for how to run a radio show.
7653243	7653723	Hello?
7654384	7655844	I don't understand this.
7655864	7657225	Does this thing work?
7657245	7658845	This thing reads like stereo instructions.
7658865	7659525	Is this on?
7659545	7660126	What the hell?
7662687	7664087	Orange Lounge Radio.
7664267	7666448	Broke down Ghetto Bomani Radio.
7666468	7666868	What the?
7670307	7673690	You're telling me, Broke Down, Get Over My Radio, we can't get our Skype tour tonight.
7673970	7677333	I think it's going to be a wash for Skype tonight, because I'm getting the same problem when I get back in there.
7677353	7680936	I had one of our listeners try calling us during the break there, trying to get in.
7681456	7681957	No workie.
7682717	7684659	So I think Skype might be down tonight.
7684699	7685680	We will keep trying.
7685700	7686441	I'm not going to lose hope.
7686541	7688963	If we can fit in even one call.
7689043	7691024	It caught your whooping cough or something.
7691825	7694307	If we can fit in even one call before the end of the show, we will do it.
7694347	7698771	But, you know, this show existed for like a year and a half before we ever had Skype, so we will...
7699131	7700992	Of course, then again, the show was only two hours then, too.
7701372	7704033	But we'll find a way to get through this somehow.
7704553	7707815	And I realize you guys are seeing us online.
7707935	7713897	I assure you guys, even though we are somehow showing us online, we are not getting the pop-up box that shows us we have a call.
7714197	7715398	Therefore, we cannot take your call.
7716138	7720400	We thought about patching through DarkSakura's laptop, but unfortunately, that is not an option either.
7720760	7721881	I told you I can't go wrong if I pick Damon.
7750933	7751954	You know why you won?
7752034	7754975	Because Roz was rallying the troops in the chat room for you, I think.
7756556	7760698	That was a big part of the reason why I think you got it.
7760938	7761658	So, good job.
7762279	7780788	Blur wins, and we'll go into rotation on our Bomani Video Game Music program, which, by the way, I updated in some capacity this week, and we're going to take a look at the Video Game Music portion very soon, but Bomani got a little bit of a facelift, and that is all based on your scores that come up in the... For those of you that listen through Live 365 and not through iTunes, you get little
7780828	7782278	Little thumbs up and thumbs down icon
7783035	7784836	You can actually, whoa, my stupid microphone.
7785056	7789019	You get a little thumbs up and thumbs down icon where you can actually rate the songs as they play.
7790159	7793961	So we actually took out a couple of the Bomani songs that were very low rated.
7794482	7797604	Some of the stuff from Ultramix 2, some of the old, old songs.
7797644	7804388	We just kind of flushed out of there and put in some of the good Ultramix 3 songs and Happy Sky and some other stuff too.
7804428	7806309	We just kind of filled it out.
7806549	7810591	I threw in a new Castlevania song for good measure just because I was like, oh, this song should be in rotation.
7810611	7811712	So I snuck one new one in there.
7816707	7818688	This microphone is pissing me off.
7818788	7821109	Anyway, I hate this mic.
7822270	7825412	That's what we need to use our $25 just to get on as a replacement mic.
7825632	7828494	We need to actually put down some money and get good mics.
7828554	7831455	We should invest it, and then in a year we could have a good mic.
7832096	7832716	Oh, a good mic.
7833756	7844883	Because that microphone that you're using there would be about what we could afford if we invested the $25, because that's one that Angel very kindly donated to us, and that's... You know this, for years that mic's been lasting pretty long.
7845303	7845423	It's...
7845851	7846712	Yeah, that one's not bad.
7847492	7849514	You know what?
7851755	7855238	I'm about ready to go just buy my own top dollar mic.
7856159	7856659	That would be nice.
7856679	7858260	Well, that's a great mic.
7858320	7858761	It really is.
7858781	7860142	The one you're using is a fabulous mic.
7860442	7864005	But it costs this much times eight.
7864585	7867728	It costs that much times eight is how much that costs, according to Angel.
7868188	7868528	Oh, yeah.
7868828	7869229	Wow.
7869249	7870450	Anyway.
7875283	7882348	Um, and I see some people in the room bitching about my microphone suggestion to turn up the mixing board's mic boost until the microphone works.
7882688	7892175	Unfortunately, that doesn't work right because the problem with this microphone is it's what we call, um, I think they call it unidirectional, which means it only works if the microphone is pointing
7892555	7893796	in one particular direction.
7893816	7898318	And it's really good for reporters who are trying to interview someone who don't want to get all that background noise.
7898858	7904260	But the problem is, usually what you get is a cardio-shaped microphone, which is like a heart-shaped audio pattern.
7904440	7909102	Or you have a, I think, omni-directional microphone, which is you can pick up sound in all directions.
7909482	7912164	And DarkSakura and Loki have omni-directional microphones.
7912484	7915365	So no matter which way they're holding the microphone, it's picking up their sound.
7915725	7919467	Unfortunately, with this microphone, if I turn it just a little bit too far one direction,
7919847	7923809	You suddenly lose the voice and you don't hear me as well.
7924069	7927350	So I have to talk specifically into one part of this microphone or it doesn't work.
7928230	7932512	And the problem is that I'm not necessarily used to this microphone, so that's why you get a lot of weird sound out of this.
7932792	7934093	So, go figure.
7935333	7937014	You still sound more normal than I do.
7938014	7939095	Eh, to some extent.
7939735	7943077	And then people are saying in the chat room, oh, my headset mic only cost me $8.
7943117	7946278	The problem is that we used to use those headsets...
7947776	7950997	Hey, and the headsets that I brought were expensive.
7951538	7954059	And they were... They were call center headsets.
7954139	7956440	Yeah, and the problem is they kind of sounded like call center.
7956480	7957720	They didn't... They were good.
7957760	7958421	They worked at the time.
7958441	7958781	They were free.
7959321	7962062	But remember that very, very, very first mic we had?
7962102	7963203	It was the guest microphone.
7963263	7967605	It was this little, tiny $10 microphone that sounded like you were talking out of two Dixie Cups and a string.
7967685	7968065	Yeah.
7968205	7970206	I wish I had... What happened to the boom mic?
7971106	7971827	The boom mic?
7972287	7974288	Yeah, the big... Oh, the boom mic.
7974308	7974668	Whatever.
7974688	7975869	That's at Loki's house.
7975929	7976549	Yeah, it's still my house.
7977149	7981092	The boom mic was our idea because we used to have a lot of sidebar conversations.
7981933	7985936	Because in the old place, in the old studio, we would have like 10 people that could fit in the studio.
7986256	7987697	It was an ambient mic.
7987757	7990359	Yeah, and the boom mic was supposed to pick up sidebar conversations.
7990379	7993542	It was to kind of encourage people to shut the F up while we're trying to do a show.
7994302	7997705	Well, it was supposed to be so you could hear people yelling in the background.
7999106	7999566	Oh, that too.
8000607	8001848	It worked pretty good for what we had.
8001908	8003129	It worked okay.
8003569	8004470	It was kind of hit and miss.
8004972	8008135	It was hidden, so no one knew where it was, so they couldn't talk into it.
8008255	8008716	Exactly.
8009076	8009476	That's good.
8010778	8011058	All right.
8012459	8020266	I think what we'll do now, because I'm feeling a little angsty about the Skype line not working, is I think now would be a very good time for us to get into the FUs of the week.
8021127	8023190	DarkSakura, why do we do the FUs of the week every single week?
8049960	8051241	God, I haven't heard that in a while.
8052081	8055844	Big F you goes toward whatever the disease of the week is.
8056724	8062168	Apparently I went from a cold to a sinus infection to bronchitis to pneumonia to whipping cough.
8062888	8068131	And I kind of miss knowing what my voice sounds like other than listening to our old bumpers on the station.
8069832	8073435	And F you to me getting motion sick from playing We Love Katamari.
8075416	8099877	and FU goes to me not having any more time off for the rest of the year and also having to put off my trip to London until 2007 and also to whoever that was that double parked in your parking lot because they suck they suck quite a bit and also FU to me not having any hot tea right now good let's go over to Loki and see where his angst is
8101594	8105336	Um, my angst is with, um, games being boring.
8105617	8108018	Like, for example, um, Shadow Colossus.
8108398	8110880	I'm getting quite bored with that game really quick.
8111780	8114642	Um, so, yeah, I have to sell that back now.
8114882	8118765	Fuck you, this Microsoft for not saying out quite enough Xbox 360s.
8118945	8120446	Yeah, I know you want to drive a pipe.
8120486	8120986	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
8121206	8124248	You're not going to do that by really cryptic, um, commercials.
8124268	8127150	You need a commercial that screams, wow, this is kick-ass.
8127190	8128111	You know, you got to get it.
8128831	8130352	Watching people throw water balloons.
8130919	8150927	does not scream, wow, this is kickass, or watching people jump rope, no, that is not kickass, that tells me, go outside, that's what that says, so, you might be marketing that to the wrong people, um, then finally, um, fuck you McDonald's, because no matter how simple I make my orders, they just can't seem to get them right.
8154266	8155447	I didn't have a problem today.
8156188	8159491	I never have a problem with McDonald's in my order.
8159611	8159971	I do it myself.
8159991	8160331	I do it myself.
8171528	8172949	I have tea bags if you want some hot tea.
8173650	8173950	You sure?
8174190	8175351	I want my herbs from home.
8175471	8176412	I have peppermint.
8176452	8178013	I only have shitty Lipton, sorry.
8178573	8180254	I have shitty Lipton green tea, too.
8181615	8184257	I've been making peppermint and white willow tea.
8184417	8185077	Oh, that sounds good.
8185278	8186799	White willow is nasty shit.
8187079	8188360	Egyptian licorice is my favorite.
8188740	8189420	Ew.
8189460	8190481	I hate licorice.
8190861	8195585	I'm going to be online playing Mario Kart DS after this show, briefly between show and podcast.
8196185	8197306	You should get some friend codes.
8198302	8201767	I have friend codes, but I can never catch anyone online.
8201847	8204371	So just let them know and give them fair warning.
8206013	8206314	My turn.
8208176	8213064	If you did the fact that I have to go back to work tomorrow after...
8214212	8218335	Four days of not having to work because you kind of get used to not working and then you have to go back to work.
8218615	8226421	Tomorrow's going to kind of be a busy day, too, just because it's like one of those things, you know, especially when you're kind of in the role that I play at my organization.
8226481	8227922	It's kind of like I've got to find my groove.
8228522	8230804	Rob's got to get his groove back, like Stella.
8231144	8235567	I've got to get my groove back, and it's not something that's going to click at 8 o'clock in the morning tomorrow.
8235587	8237449	So I'm going to be very groggy and bitchy tomorrow.
8237789	8241732	And if you do the fact that I way overslept this weekend, I mean, seriously, I've been sleeping like...
8242492	8243654	Thank you for watching!
8258385	8264809	I think if I could have just hibernated for the past four days, it would have been great.
8265729	8271093	An F you to the fact that I couldn't get an Xbox 360 even if I wanted one.
8271413	8273874	And an F you to the fact that a lot of video games are $50, like the new ones.
8273894	8274455	$50 is a lot of money. $60.
8276896	8281262	Well, yeah, Xbox 360 is like $60, but even like, you know, current-gen platforms are $50.
8281702	8285186	Sometimes, if you're lucky, $30 or $40, but Dragon Quest VIII set me back $50.
8285287	8290573	It's kind of like, boy, oh boy, I better get 100 hours of playtime out of that game or something to make it worth it.
8290953	8291754	Otherwise, I'm going to be pissed.
8292535	8294617	Yeah, so F you to expensive things.
8295078	8295618	That's not fun.
8297540	8302164	All right, let's go to the chatroom FUs, of which I'm sure there are plenty this week.
8302605	8303666	Let's see what's going on there.
8306328	8306648	Let's see.
8307469	8323556	Rene wants to give a big huge FU to Best Buy and McDonald's for making me gather $21, Best Buy dollars, and when I finally get to use them on Ultramix 3, the website, LOL at Loki, the damn game gets on backorder, so I had to buy at full price at GameStop and get a refund.
8323996	8333180	Another FU to the manager at a nearby EB Games, where I was considering buying Ultramix 3 when he hangs up because he thinks I'm a rival manager letting him know that the game is out already.
8334949	8335850	and my last F.U.
8335870	8339294	to a wasp that took four hits with a large towel to take down.
8342657	8343298	My next F.U.
8343338	8344959	comes from Sephiroth1215.
8345420	8345560	F.U.
8345580	8347782	to my teacher giving work over Thanksgiving.
8348643	8354629	Remember back in the day when we were in high school and those bitches would give us homework over Christmas break?
8354669	8355891	It's like, read this book!
8357499	8359021	I really enjoyed reading books.
8360002	8362986	I enjoyed reading books too, but not the crap that our teachers assigned us.
8363446	8365088	I liked reading contemporary stuff.
8365809	8371615	And I remember to this day the book I hated that I had to read in high school was Dandelion Wine.
8371635	8372977	I hated that book.
8373852	8375934	Dandelion Wine, The Inferno, The Odyssey,
8394997	8395937	They had no choice.
8396017	8397038	I wrote my book report.
8397118	8397878	And look at the book!
8398378	8399398	Interesting.
8401199	8402840	What was the book?
8403340	8404480	1984, but our class didn't do that one.
8404500	8406481	We did Brave New World, which was just as weird.
8407061	8408621	You know, we did Catcher in the Rye, which was cool.
8408661	8409762	I enjoyed doing Catcher in the Rye.
8410422	8411742	I hated the Grapes of Wrath.
8412303	8413503	Fuck the Grapes of Wrath.
8413523	8414763	Oh my god, we had to do that one too.
8415103	8423306	Anyway, Sephiroth1215 also says, and F you to Tecmo for pushing back DOA4 because I want another 360 game that is actually good.
8423806	8430647	Oh, and Sephiroth1215 would like to say he's actually in college, not... Fuck it, Mike.
8430667	8431568	Same thing with college.
8431928	8432288	Seriously.
8436055	8442359	Dark Knight says, F you to Black Friday, F you to losing my stylist, I had to buy a new one, F you to being single for 18 years.
8444039	8444960	I would buy him a horn.
8445200	8446701	Seriously, I mean, that's why I'm kidding.
8447181	8447862	Hold on to it.
8448722	8450523	My stylist got eaten by my couch.
8451924	8452764	I have a spare.
8454885	8457387	Dan bought me a silver one that matches my DS.
8463343	8467545	You know you can buy those styluses in like the little color packs so you have like a purple stylus?
8467585	8468785	We have the three packs.
8468825	8473627	We have the black one, the blue one, and the silver one.
8473647	8474507	So I have a silver one.
8474587	8475587	I want a purple one.
8478028	8479489	God, I hate you like I'm a purple school.
8480990	8481550	Alright, moving on.
8481650	8484212	Roz... Seriously.
8484672	8487694	Roz wants to say an F you to Graham Coxon.
8487734	8493136	That sexy bitch delayed his new album release from Fall 2005 to March 16th, 2006.
8494297	8496338	Nice way to work in that plug, by the way.
8496378	8500120	Ron Chan says, F you to people that drop out of races on Mario Kart DS.
8500160	8501501	Take your beatings like a man.
8503002	8507184	Neo Dude Zero says, F you to crappy Linksys USB Internet adapters.
8507264	8509405	I've been in and out of both show and chat all night.
8511667	8514768	Vander C says, F you to Jamie for slapping me with a trout.
8514848	8515609	I don't like trout.
8517690	8520031	Tell him to stay tuned for my response.
8521391	8523572	You need to slap him with a grilled salmon.
8523812	8526953	Or slap him with a chili bass.
8526973	8529034	The macro is for trout.
8529214	8529555	I know.
8529575	8531795	Alright.
8533096	8537838	Tomo Kun says, Fuck me neglecting this show and the podcast for weeks upon weeks upon weeks.
8538158	8538738	I agree.
8539679	8539919	F you.
8541147	8543409	Oh, and fuck you whoever sends me the same piece of spam.
8572608	8586273	ColorOfSakura says, F you to not getting enough hours at work, F you to Mario Kart's DS's lack of good Wi-Fi interface, F you to the Xbox 360, F you to sickness, F you to getting my 2DX controller in the mail and it being broken.
8588775	8594658	Legend of Zaku says, F you to not investing $400 earlier this year, it's like getting Xbox 360 for me to sell on eBay now.
8595238	8597439	F you to sake not being as strong as I thought it would be.
8598019	8603542	F you to fucking ants that invaded my box of rice-a-roni, thus forging me to ditch that box and use up another.
8603562	8605703	I ought to be in college again.
8606223	8611106	F you to all other game stores for trying to offer me pennies for Madden 06 and NBA Live 06.
8611546	8615208	Lucky me, I knew this place around my way that gave me $50 for both of them.
8616554	8624741	and Nintendo Maniac would like to say, or Nintendo Maniac 64, says, F you to the weather for there being lots of snow and a possible snow day on Thanksgiving week.
8625602	8629605	F you to my computer for locking up a few minutes ago, preventing me from not knowing it's F you time.
8630085	8635230	F you to myself for putting a knot in my last F you when it was supposed to be there.
8635350	8635510	What?
8635770	8636511	It wasn't supposed to be there.
8637211	8651905	F you to myself for building a DS LEGO charging deck which took up my charger and I had to partially disassemble it to get my charger out so I could play Mario Kart DS without my DS's battery dying.
8654048	8655349	Mine still won't fit together.
8659863	8661904	Yeah, I liked your little Lego charger that you had there.
8661924	8663324	That was kind of cool stuff.
8664504	8665144	I missed that thing.
8665184	8665565	It was cool.
8665605	8668345	I should get some Legos and build me a Lego base.
8668385	8670966	What I also liked about it is that you can put your games and your styluses in it.
8670986	8671746	I thought that was kind of cool.
8671846	8677627	Yeah, except every now and then it's sitting on my cabinet and every now and then I knock into it and it falls over and it breaks.
8678108	8679608	But yeah, I don't have that many games.
8680468	8681068	But it works good.
8681568	8682529	It works good for charging.
8685009	8688330	Can you use hot glue and you put it together and it'll never fall apart?
8689366	8696478	Yeah, and then you'll never be able to get that stupid charger thing out of there because you basically hold the wire in place with Legos or something underneath it.
8696538	8696779	Yeah.
8697540	8697900	Not fun.
8697981	8699062	It's stuck in there pretty good.
8700525	8700966	That's cool.
8700986	8702348	I like that DS charging station.
8702368	8702869	It was a good idea.
8703422	8708148	I'll have to find, I have the specs on my computer still.
8708849	8709550	Post those.
8710271	8710771	It was fun.
8711272	8711652	Good times.
8712914	8720664	Alright, I think what we're going to do is we're going to go to a break and when we come back we might do some Ask Orange Lounge if the Skype line's not working.
8721484	8725726	and some other stories, whatever tickles our fancy when we come back after this break.
8725766	8729668	And in this break, more Bomani Potpourri, because we can.
8730148	8732710	And we'll start it off with an old school Beatmania song.
8732750	8734611	We're going to do Total Recall.
8735471	8737932	We'll be back with more Orange Lounge Radio right after this.
8750808	8752110	Thank you for watching!
8782967	8783608	Oh, oh, oh
8823804	8828222	Straight, Indie Record Store, I'm picking something up, I'm picking something more
8857111	8858653	Yeah, I know that you'll be mine
8917788	8919129	Thank you for watching!
8973238	8973962	Thanks for watching!
9030668	9032178	Let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go
9118192	9124375	Gaming Radio, so uncensored that even Tom Brokaw could get a job with us.
9126836	9128197	Orange Lounge Radio.
9130938	9132899	Back, boys and girls, with more Orange Lounge Radio.
9134140	9136821	And a broke-ass Skype line, so we have no callers tonight.
9137967	9140408	God, thank God we didn't have any interviews or anything scheduled tonight.
9140448	9140928	Thank God.
9141908	9142789	We'd be really screwed.
9144369	9150131	So, sorry guys, we can't get you guys in on the Skype line, so we're not going to be able to do some calls tonight.
9150171	9153952	We'll try one more time before the end of the show, although I somehow highly doubt it's going to work.
9155232	9157833	And apologize to those of you guys that were waiting to call in, but you know what?
9158834	9159434	Shit happens.
9162133	9167775	Of course, next week we'll be back with another episode of Orange Lounge Radio Live, and all of us will be here.
9168075	9170036	Maybe we'll have some special guests next week, I don't know.
9170616	9173737	We've got to talk some of our buddies into coming on over to the show.
9174898	9179259	Don't forget, we also have other live programming on Orange Lounge Radio all week long.
9179299	9185481	Monday nights, Extroverse Case of the Mondays, which airs at 7 o'clock.
9185641	9185882	Yeah, 7.
9187242	9188303	DarkSakura is with us with...
9213926	9224613	I pump up the volume which I'm doing every other Tuesday until the end of the semester and then I'll be back on regularly it's a music request show, I play whatever just tune in
9226109	9230672	Wednesday nights on the station, The Rob Roberts Show, which is also on at 7 o'clock Pacific Time.
9231112	9235695	And same sort of deal, I do take requests, but that's not really the concept of my show.
9236395	9237596	I just play whatever the hell I feel like.
9237636	9239017	And I also talk about geek stuff.
9239397	9242879	I find some geek articles on the web and kind of give you my opinion on them.
9242919	9248083	I'm kind of like Rush Limbaugh in that way, except not a fat drug addict, basically.
9251125	9255310	Also, on Orange Lounge Radio, we may have some new shows coming soon.
9255330	9257512	We're looking at expanding the station in the future.
9257712	9259093	May happen, may not, we don't know.
9259534	9264018	Very likely, though, that you're going to see some exciting stuff in the future at Orange Lounge Radio.
9264479	9265079	Stay tuned.
9265480	9267382	But as you'll notice, we've got Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday.
9267402	9271806	We've got a couple days we can do some other stuff with, so we will see what happens.
9272567	9272847	Moving on.
9274403	9276086	Shall we do some Ask Orange Lounge, boys and girls?
9276586	9279070	Alright, I got the thumbs up from DarkSakura, so here we go!
9282676	9284919	It helped to have the volume up when I bring in the theme music, huh?
9290993	9293876	Let's ask Orange Lounge some stupid question.
9294376	9297699	What will we find out this week on Orange Lounge Radio?
9298380	9301543	Will we find out why this microphone is broken?
9301743	9304706	Because I'm about to throw it through a window if it doesn't cooperate.
9304726	9312333	Yeah, apparently all they heard was geek articles and then fat drug addict.
9313999	9322345	No, what I said is geek articles, and I'm kind of like a one-man Rush Limbaugh, because I give my opinions on them, except I'm not a fat drug addict.
9322765	9324246	That was the correct thing that I said.
9328089	9331571	Sakurina wants to know, does Sky like Rizlem the remix?
9332572	9335454	I believe that's a song in Night Style, right?
9336850	9338610	That's over in the 9th style.
9338751	9340971	Let me see if I can get a little clip here of the Rizlem remix.
9341731	9343712	DarkSakura is over there in the corner gagging.
9344072	9346272	I take it you do not like the Rizlem remix.
9346432	9349613	It could just be a lung cookie, but it sort of made my stomach turn.
9350833	9353914	Hold on, let me see if we can get a little clip here of the Rizlem remix.
9357555	9359055	Yeah, that crap.
9359996	9362236	I like the part that doesn't have the singing in it.
9362716	9363556	Like, this is cool.
9363756	9365177	The thing where we get in the middle?
9367737	9368960	I like the plot where it ends.
9370382	9370703	I don't know.
9370783	9371825	I like that kind of stuff.
9372627	9373489	It's just it doesn't work.
9374611	9375172	It's okay.
9375793	9376214	It's okay.
9378462	9379363	I prefer the original.
9379383	9380484	I definitely prefer the original.
9380624	9381164	But it's okay.
9381305	9381805	I don't hate it.
9381845	9383267	I don't despise it like DarkSakura does.
9384248	9385589	Still gotta work on the other remix.
9385729	9386750	Yeah.
9387011	9389313	Are you gonna tell us about the samples thing?
9389413	9390334	You gotta tell us.
9390354	9390795	Hold on.
9390895	9392877	After Asporn's launch, we'll get into that.
9393357	9400585	Does anyone know the approximate cost of a 2DX 9th style machine and if they are still in production?
9401604	9404126	2DX Red on eBay right now, it's in City of Industry, $5,100.
9422438	9425300	So that's probably what you're looking at for a 9-star machine as well.
9425360	9426241	It is not cheap.
9427282	9430944	And Sakurina also wants to know how Xtifer knows how to pronounce 2DX when he doesn't even play it.
9431405	9432626	Um, cause he's heard me say it.
9432806	9438050	And he, you know, Miklatov spends the weekend here sometimes and we'll both be playing it and he's like, what's that?
9438110	9439131	And we say, it's 2DX.
9439511	9440131	So he knows it.
9440512	9442393	Cause he's Tina, he just sucks at it.
9443274	9443874	Just teasing.
9444374	9448417	He is a pro at, uh, at Taiko No Tatooine.
9449879	9451660	He's actually very good at Taiko No Tatooine.
9454556	9455317	Uh, let's see, moving on.
9456098	9458900	Tomo Kun wants to know, how about that show, The Boondocks?
9460020	9460961	I've never seen this show.
9461522	9464224	I remember reading the comics in my funny papers.
9465805	9467006	Not interested in watching this show.
9467026	9469708	There was a funny show I did hear about, and I want to see it.
9469728	9471869	It's supposed to be late tonight is when it's on.
9472230	9474811	MTV2, it's called Wondershosen.
9475612	9478174	It's like an adult version of Sesame Street.
9479301	9480443	That sounds awesome.
9480743	9481284	MTV2.
9481945	9483127	I'm gonna have to... It's late at night.
9483748	9485491	Are Bert and Ernie really gay in this one?
9485852	9489618	No, they have, like, different characters, but they have one, it's, uh, what is it, um...
9491284	9496767	D-O-G-Y-N is one of the, you know, like, dog OBGYNs.
9496967	9499908	And then they also have, like, some weird ones.
9500088	9504270	There's one, like, they were talking about the letter N, and nobody liked the letter N, so N left.
9504550	9513795	Then they had to find the letter S with the track down the letter N, and instead of tracking N down, ended up having sex with N and had babies and stuff.
9514275	9516577	Who is your favorite character in the Super Mario Bros.
9516597	9516837	series?
9547588	9549370	Who's your favorite character in the Super Mario Bros.
9549410	9549710	series?
9552132	9555795	Um... I really don't know.
9557517	9559839	I'd say Princess Peach, because Peach is the winner!
9560039	9561861	She's such an arrogant little fuck, I like her.
9562801	9563302	Big Boo!
9564062	9564543	Big Boo!
9564803	9565264	Big Boo!
9565524	9566545	Big Boo's pretty awesome.
9566905	9567345	You, Loki?
9567886	9568286	Geno.
9569307	9569527	Who?
9569888	9570268	Geno.
9570388	9571909	He's from Super Mario RPG.
9572550	9573150	Oh, God.
9573651	9574672	Wow, that's obscure.
9577883	9578623	More questions.
9582126	9584828	Rimi asks the following.
9584868	9585989	Consider the following.
9586929	9592053	Medical science advances to the point where a device can seal wounds on the spot.
9592594	9593134	Problem.
9593615	9599179	Your friends use said technology to seal your ass shut as a practical joke.
9599819	9600380	What do you do?
9600920	9601881	Go on, jackass.
9605383	9606004	Viva la banja.
9606277	9606937	Fart it open.
9607338	9610619	I think you would die because your colon would explode.
9611040	9611780	Fart it open!
9612140	9615342	Or you would go to the hospital and, I don't know, have them cut it open.
9615402	9621505	You know, yeah, I would think if the medical science is far enough along where they could seal your ass shut magically, they could unseal it magically.
9622266	9623826	If it ain't broken, they can't fix it.
9626908	9629449	And what are some pretty underrated songs on DDR?
9629529	9630410	Oh, a real question.
9630450	9631010	That's good to know.
9631410	9633852	What are some pretty underrated songs on DDR?
9635580	9636080	Moving on.
9636501	9637582	Someone's knocking on the door.
9637842	9638262	No, that's me.
9638362	9639383	I'm tapping on the table.
9640344	9641705	Moving on from DDR5thMix.
9643086	9644106	I like that song.
9644126	9644987	That's a cool song.
9645087	9645447	What else?
9645628	9647869	Can you think of anything, DarkSakura?
9649630	9651092	Underrated songs in DDR.
9652132	9655935	That's really easy because I always said Love That Feeling was underrated.
9656516	9658037	Oh, because a lot of people hate on Love That Feeling.
9658777	9659057	Bass.
9660218	9661119	Yeah, that's a good one.
9661940	9664321	God, most of the songs I like, a lot of people...
9665919	9667640	Xanadu Night in Motion Kongafelin
9693755	9695635	I'm trying to think of some of the more recent mixes.
9695675	9700757	Fantasy from Extreme 2.
9700797	9703397	No, Fantasy was in Max 1.
9703457	9705698	It was in Max 1 and then didn't come back for Max 2.
9707158	9707478	That one?
9707898	9709299	Yeah.
9709419	9709719	Is that it?
9709739	9710479	That's Max 2.
9710679	9712719	Fantasy was the one that was Eurobeat from Max 1.
9713160	9714060	Oh, Fantasy.
9715020	9718441	Yeah, that one needs to go away, but the other one, that one's pretty good.
9718541	9719101	That is a good one.
9722148	9722948	I'm trying to think of U.S.
9723468	9724409	Also, there's U.S.
9724489	9726589	licenses that I think are incredibly underrated.
9727070	9734332	I don't think the PlayStation 2 fanboys need to recognize that Xbox has some really good songs on Ultramix 2, such as Skulk.
9735472	9738993	But I don't know if I would call that underrated, because anyone that's played it knows it's awesome.
9739614	9740574	But I'm trying to think of other U.S.
9740634	9742214	licenses that I think are a little bit underrated.
9742755	9747276	I always liked Dark Black Forest, and I know a lot of people hated it on that song, but I thought it was a great song.
9747316	9749097	Just a very random choice for DDR.
9749117	9749737	I thought it was great.
9750727	9752368	and what was the other one?
9752388	9753649	There's another one that was really good.
9753709	9754750	That was also O.M.
9755410	9756491	Max.
9757451	9757812	Max USA?
9757832	9758052	Yeah.
9758072	9762855	The Take It To The Morning... Yeah.
9762955	9763395	I like that one.
9763415	9763835	That one, yeah.
9763995	9764636	I like that song, too.
9767858	9769119	How about a question from me?
9769179	9773942	Because I see our chat room is suddenly singing, My humps, my humps, what would you do if they put my humps in DDR?
9773962	9775703	Because Loki hates that song, by the way.
9775723	9775783	Bye.
9777308	9786517	Yeah, I would say that's pretty bad, but thank God it hasn't been put in, and I would have to show my fiancé and she'd have to laugh at me.
9786857	9790040	I actually like Hey Mama a lot in Ultramix 3, though.
9790080	9791201	I gotta say, that was a good choice.
9791301	9792822	For a Black Eyed Peas song, that was a really good choice.
9792842	9795205	This is it.
9797950	9798350	Black Eyed Peas
9828070	9828711	I have heard this song.
9828791	9829691	I heard it in spin.
9829731	9829971	See?
9829991	9832493	I heard it in spin and I remember hating it.
9832513	9833133	Black Eyed Peas?
9833153	9833314	Yeah.
9833354	9836055	Oh, in the Best Buy commercial, the, you know, remix!
9836095	9836516	Yeah, I know.
9836576	9838537	I friggin' hate this microphone.
9838617	9839418	I hate this microphone.
9839438	9840098	Black Eyed Peas are okay.
9854504	9859026	Xander C wants to know, do I suck at DDR if I can't beat Max Unlimited on Heavy?
9859407	9863369	And is it weird that I can't beat that but manage to beat Charlene in the group of an expert?
9864149	9865470	I can't beat Max Unlimited on Heavy.
9865890	9872073	Again, I used to play doubles and I would play some crazy shit in doubles and I still couldn't beat it.
9872113	9872993	It's just too fast.
9873593	9875534	It's not really a song that should be played.
9875574	9878956	They just made it really super hard and ooh, I did it.
9879096	9880577	But it's not a song to be played for fun.
9881657	9882798	And I don't think it's odd that you
9887040	9898427	I don't think it's odd that you can't beat that, but you can beat Charlene, because I remember, I think it was Charlene, I might be mixing it up with one of the erotic songs, but I think maybe I'm wrong.
9900652	9908674	I might be mixing up Charlene with Lemmings on the run, but I remember that one of them on heavy had an awful lot of freezes, was like the big thing, was there was a lot of freezes in the hands.
9909194	9919316	And if I could do hands, unfortunately I'm very tall and my back will go out very easily if I do too much of the hands thing, which is one of the reasons I don't like in the groove because I hate the hands thing.
9919996	9922657	I could almost beat it, though, if it weren't for that.
9923197	9928720	I don't remember if it was that or Charlene that I was very close to beating, but yet I haven't come close to beating Max Unlimited.
9929000	9930240	And I have no problem sharing that.
9930341	9934823	I don't think you have to necessarily be the bestest DDR player in the world.
9934883	9935703	I mean, who cares?
9936203	9937264	You play it because it's fun.
9937284	9938024	That's why I play it.
9938264	9943507	That's why I don't mind when they release a new mix of DDR and there's only one 10-footer in it and a bunch of 7s.
9943667	9949010	I like the game better that way because DDR for me is more of a casual workout type thing and not a...
9950250	9955591	I want to wheeze and throw up, you know, lung chunks after, no offense, lung chunks after one song.
9955651	9958092	Hey, I know all about throwing up lung chunks.
9958472	9958732	Sorry?
9959012	9960392	I want to get back to the wheezing part.
9960433	9961433	That's fun.
9962593	9968814	Well, the sad thing is I probably wouldn't even be able to beat, like, Breakdown or Stay on Heavy, and I used to be able to do those, no problem.
9968895	9969515	I beat Breakdown.
9970035	9970855	I probably couldn't do it.
9971638	9977907	Having a fiance really cuts into the 8 hour sessions of DDR that I used to do in arcade.
9977967	9979729	It's just... I can't do it anymore.
9983034	9987160	Oh, it's Queen of Light that's the freezes in hands and Charlene is just a lot of runs.
9988121	9989362	Legend of Zaku wants to say...
10016440	10019201	I'm in the market for some good-ass sake.
10019521	10020361	Any suggestions?
10020522	10023202	I've never had sake in my life, believe it or not, so I can't help you.
10023603	10028524	There's a brand I like, but for the life of me, I can't remember how to pronounce the name, so give me a sec, I'll look for it.
10028845	10029725	Okay, uh, Loki?
10029745	10031105	I don't drink sake.
10031165	10031345	Any sake?
10031385	10032146	Yeah, I don't drink it either.
10032306	10033746	What's a plum wine that you usually get?
10033786	10036747	I know that's not sake, but speaking of, like, you know, Asian liquor, what was that?
10037127	10037548	That was good.
10039068	10040009	Uh, shoot.
10041529	10043490	The cheap stuff I buy is the Takara brand.
10043770	10043950	Okay.
10045026	10047869	Alright, let's check out the, uh, uh, sake thing.
10048169	10050692	He basically all actually has his own energy drink.
10050932	10052493	Just some random trivia thrown in there.
10053877	10062859	Legend of Zaku wants to know, I wonder if you t-voted last week's episodes of Direct Effect in which yours truly was seen as well as New York City's best DDR player being profiled.
10063939	10065319	I forgot to set the t-vote.
10065379	10067439	And I had it on there and everything, I forgot to do it.
10067879	10069260	But I know they're going to rerun it to death.
10069300	10070860	It'll be on again, so I'm not too worried.
10071420	10073701	And I'm sure Zaku will tell me when it's being rerun.
10073721	10076681	Here's a good brand for the plum wine.
10078181	10079822	It's got the green plums at the bottom.
10080222	10081222	Ah, yes, I remember that.
10083202	10086163	Yes, you bought that once and we got drunk off that shit.
10086223	10088943	And you can't tell because it doesn't taste like booze.
10089223	10091844	One of the first times me and you got drunk together was off that stuff.
10091864	10092404	Off that stuff.
10092964	10096085	So now look up that sake and let us know.
10097805	10098685	Meanwhile, more questions.
10098705	10100486	We're doing Ask Orange Lounge here on Orange Lounge Radio.
10100506	10105487	If you're just joining us, this is a portion of the show where the listeners can submit questions to us and we answer them because we love our listeners.
10105507	10106107	You're just joining us.
10106127	10107127	You're a bit late, too.
10115062	10123910	I want to learn Japanese, but I'm poor, so I can't pay anything, and there's nothing or anyone near me that could teach it to me for free.
10124410	10127233	Anything good and free on the internet, I'm out of ideas.
10127693	10135300	I have a suggestion, try out podcasts, because there's actually a lot of podcasts out there that try to teach you how to speak a second language, not just Spanish, but I'm sure there's a Japanese one out there too.
10136060	10137301	A lot of good free stuff.
10137581	10140682	I don't know if you can find anything at an elementary level, but you never know.
10141362	10152926	Also, sometimes if you look on some of the sites such as BitTorrent stuff, you can sometimes find and learn how to speak Japanese CD, which, you know, it's better than nothing.
10153186	10153846	Go to college.
10154906	10155727	Yeah, or go to college.
10156007	10156327	Or if you...
10156727	10158368	BOOM BOOM Satellites BOOM BOOM Satellites
10183410	10187951	NintendoManiac64 says, did anyone make a YTMND out of your I Like Big Dick quote yet?
10188551	10189671	No, they haven't, and I hope they don't.
10191172	10194773	Also wants to know, how was my Firefox Mario Kart DS decal?
10196273	10196813	It was cool.
10196873	10203774	I imagine you probably used that same thing that a lot of people use to turn a graphic into an emblem.
10204075	10205635	But what I want to know is, what was that thing...
10206315	10221465	Where you were going back and forth, because I remember playing you, you were going back and forth on the track a lot, like, I don't know if you were trying to do like a bunch of drifts, but you were going really fast, and I know you weren't getting that many mushrooms, so, I don't know, were you trying to do a bunch of drifts or something?
10221585	10222045	Snaking?
10222345	10223506	Snaking, what the hell is this?
10223666	10231908	Well, the things I've seen people doing wasn't snaking, because it looks like they're spasming on the track.
10232248	10239550	I understand what snaking is, where you drift back and forth really quick to do the little boost so you go faster that way.
10239810	10241951	It's hard to do, you have to have the right cart for it, but...
10242831	10265270	You can do it, but the thing is, they used to do that actually in, remember back in F-Zero GX, except that was done differently, that was with the break boosting or whatever, and you can do that with Mario Kart Double Dash, you can do it with the drifts the same way, but this is something different though, and I don't know why, because when I've seen these players...
10265490	10266171	Is anyone there really gay?
10266211	10268913	I'm ignorant and gullible so I usually can't tell if you guys are joking or not
10281445	10287087	DarkSakura has a husband, so obviously she is, you know, dansexual, I believe, as she calls it.
10287287	10287947	Dansexual.
10288887	10293429	Loki has a fiancé and does not like any of the cock, as far as I know.
10294009	10295109	Not that he has a problem with that.
10296130	10297350	He's completely straight, yes?
10298130	10298310	Yes.
10298730	10299571	I am gay.
10299751	10302131	I am literally gay, and it's fine.
10303252	10303932	It's not a joke.
10304052	10309634	We joke about it because, you know, it's kind of like how, you know, gay people can call each other fag and that's okay.
10311374	10313155	Just like how black people always call... Never mind.
10314216	10314516	Forget it.
10315457	10316778	But, you know.
10317878	10320260	Yes, I'm gay and so is Xtifer, but we are not together.
10320280	10326003	That's a very common misconception I think people think because Xtifer and I live together and we're both gay, we must be fucking, but that's not true.
10326924	10329365	No, Xtifer and I are just buds, we're like brothers, nothing like that.
10330486	10336329	However, I date, I've been seeing someone, and I've kind of brought that up a couple times on the show, but...
10337730	10342955	I don't think he'd be used to the idea of me talking about him on the air yet, and he could be listening, so I don't say a whole lot about it.
10343295	10343795	But he's cool.
10343855	10344816	He's a gamer, too.
10345217	10347739	He plays Mario Kart DS with me, so he rocks.
10350641	10350961	Who else?
10351542	10352923	I think he's cute, too.
10354284	10354624	Thank you.
10355245	10355705	He is cute.
10355725	10356166	He is a cutie.
10356866	10358367	A little quiet sometimes, but a cutie, I like him.
10358467	10360909	Even though the one time I met him, I was highly intoxicated.
10360929	10362810	You were very intoxicated, but he's a nice guy.
10364992	10367854	And I don't think Miklatov would mind me sharing that he's gay, too.
10368254	10369815	And that's cool.
10370476	10372097	So, yes, there are really gay people that do this.
10372277	10377701	But we don't talk a whole lot about... Well, we do talk about the sexuality thing, and I think it might be hard to tell that we're joking sometimes.
10378081	10379542	DarkSakura.com
10404598	10408121	Not just her, but other girl presenters on podcasts, game podcasts, get targeted.
10408402	10408682	They do.
10409102	10411804	Because some guys don't know how to deal with that.
10411824	10412305	I don't know what it is.
10412325	10413566	They assume that she's a giggling girl.
10413986	10418250	To quote one site, put down the controller and get back in the kitchen.
10418450	10419511	Excuse me, fuck you.
10419531	10421813	See, that's just stupid.
10423895	10425096	Um, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
10427090	10430651	Um, okay, he's got too many questions, so I'm jumping right to his last question.
10430711	10432652	Why did you say I used the decal generator?
10432812	10434733	I made my Firefox decal myself.
10434773	10435313	Took two hours.
10435993	10436674	Good for you.
10436954	10438674	Sorry, I made an assumption.
10439054	10439495	Shoot me.
10444096	10445517	I'm going to make a penis decal.
10445537	10450899	I have to play the game just to do that.
10453903	10455124	I like in our chat room there.
10455444	10462466	I'm just now reading all the chat room is that everybody is like gasping and saying that they're so surprised at the fact that I'm gay.
10462926	10465667	And Zaku says that Sky can't say nigga.
10465967	10466647	Oh, crap.
10466907	10467387	Oh, crap.
10467587	10468207	I just saw him.
10468448	10469368	Man, I screwed up.
10471969	10474869	And then, of course, my favorite term ever, gamer.
10475130	10478230	Color of Sakura says I'm a gamer with a G-A-Y capital.
10478250	10478871	Get it, gamer?
10479751	10480051	Love it.
10484786	10485207	Moving on.
10485867	10490388	Color of Sakura wants to know, any suggestions on what 2DX song track I should buy?
10490768	10493668	I have 2DX Red and Happy Sky, so other than those two.
10495649	10497769	I love, love, love Fifth Style.
10498969	10500270	I love Fifth Style's soundtrack.
10500750	10501550	So I suggest that.
10501570	10503210	If you're going to go old school, go for Fifth Style.
10503550	10504990	I used to wake up to that every morning.
10505771	10505991	Eight.
10507011	10507471	There you have it.
10509634	10514578	NeoDude0 says, what good dance pads are there besides Red Octane that don't cost $500?
10514898	10518080	There's the kind you build yourself.
10518941	10524625	There's the one that DDR Game puts out, but I'm going to be honest, we played it at E3, not impressed by their product.
10524885	10525706	And it injured.
10527227	10528287	That's right, I remember that.
10528788	10536693	Yeah, so honestly, I suppose if you want something that is cheap and effective and you don't play a lot of katas, just go for the $20 Madcatz ones.
10537874	10542716	I know a lot of people knock on the Mad Catz ones, but honestly, for the casual DDR player, it'll work.
10542936	10543556	It'll get you through the day.
10543576	10550959	Or if you take a softpad and you mount it on a wood, and you do the... That's a good idea, too.
10551019	10555221	Yeah, just basically mounting something on a board makes a softpad even better.
10555781	10559142	I don't know if she came up again here, but she used to have that at her old apartment.
10559162	10560443	They worked very, very well.
10560783	10563106	I was the first 9-footer I ever passed was on those.
10563627	10564308	Me too, I think.
10564428	10565609	No, second 9-footer I ever did was on those.
10565629	10568192	Because I passed Electro-Tuned.
10568473	10570795	That's right.
10571656	10572938	No, it wasn't Electro-Tuned.
10573018	10574660	It was Lupin.
10574700	10575621	Hypnotic Crisis?
10576102	10576663	It was Lupin.
10576683	10576963	Lupin.
10576983	10579987	Because that was right before I passed Lupin because I had actually passed Hypnotic Crisis before.
10581181	10582364	I let you change with my second one.
10583165	10584589	That was Orion 7-8.
10584649	10586212	I remember I did this at her place.
10586352	10587775	I slowed it down and I listened.
10587815	10590461	Because you remember how Orion 7-8 has this very distinct pattern.
10592898	10609008	Do you remember back when you had a Bomani party and stuff and we debuted Kakumei on the sim because the game hadn't even come out yet but the sim file for the test location came out?
10609028	10609108	I do.
10609128	10609588	I remember that.
10609608	10611109	That was so stupid.
10611269	10611689	But good.
10611729	10612570	No, it was good.
10613110	10614051	And it was so easy.
10614471	10615572	I miss Bomani parties.
10615592	10616312	We need to have another one.
10616732	10618053	We do.
10618313	10620215	Let's just get drunk and call it a Bomani party.
10621175	10623299	I think once I get my house in order, I'm planning on having one.
10623539	10624020	Badass.
10624100	10624901	If Dan doesn't like it.
10624921	10625983	We should broadcast live from it.
10626884	10627606	That would rock.
10627866	10635659	Legend of Zaku says, how come game chain stores and some small time mom and pop stores treat new sealed games like beater copies when trying to get money for them?
10637641	10638723	because they assume you stole them.
10639063	10644891	Honestly, I think that's why a lot of people have policies against sealed games is because it's assumed that they're stolen.
10644931	10645813	And I know what you're doing.
10645853	10646654	I know you didn't steal them.
10646694	10650800	I know you're trying to sell back promo copies, but you're not supposed to sell back promo copies either.
10651060	10651761	It's actually...
10653002	10654323	I don't know so much about giveaways.
10654383	10657505	Giveaways is kind of a gray area, but at least promo copies.
10657605	10662067	Usually when they do giveaways, they give away promo copies and it's part of the deal with promo copies.
10662087	10663008	You're not supposed to sell them.
10663268	10666510	That's why with motion pictures and stuff, big deal.
10666530	10668631	They put the tracking numbers on the screeners and all that shit.
10669932	10670332	Crazy stuff.
10676871	10683917	What can I use to convert WMV3 encoded media to anything that isn't WMV3?
10684338	10686119	AVI, MPEG, DivX, etc.
10686219	10686780	on a PC.
10687480	10688181	I have no idea.
10688241	10690163	I don't know enough about video encoding, I'm going to be honest.
10690623	10691824	Google and look it up.
10692925	10693385	Or VCD Helper.
10696053	10698835	Oh, I haven't heard of this.
10699316	10699876	It's a website.
10700837	10702438	They have tutorials for converting everything.
10702718	10704920	But this is Windows Media file.
10706621	10710945	I'm guessing probably Windows Media.
10711105	10711565	I don't know.
10711725	10720352	Maybe a program like TMG Encoder or whatever.
10721033	10722354	I'm hoping someone in our chat knows.
10723502	10725944	We just had a link posted to JetAudio.com.
10726604	10727044	There we go.
10727605	10728085	There you have it.
10728746	10729606	Well, kids, it's about 9.30.
10729726	10731888	It's about time for us to wrap up the show.
10732148	10734129	And I appreciate you guys participating tonight.
10734169	10735530	Sorry we didn't get to all the questions.
10736731	10738192	But it was a very popular segment.
10738212	10739253	Sorry about Skype, you guys.
10739293	10740133	We'll be back next week.
10740173	10742095	I will reinstall Skype so we have it again.
10743696	10744096	That's it.
10744136	10744697	That's the show.
10745137	10748099	And thanks to Miklatov and Ekstafor for being here in the beginning.
10748139	10751461	But otherwise, for just the three of us and no Skype, not too bad.
10751821	10752302	So good job.
10753522	10754923	Hey.
10755143	10756383	And final thought time.
10756423	10757263	Loki, your final thought.
10759164	10762465	I'm going into Mario Kart Online right now.
10762585	10765466	So if you want to play me, that's where I'll be.
10767106	10770207	My final thought is Loki should be preparing for the podcast.
10770407	10771568	I've already done that.
10771648	10772028	All right.
10772668	10773268	DarkSakura.
10774269	10778850	Reject false icons and thanks to everyone who sent me those emails with the Wellicious.
10779390	10780270	Oh, that's sweet.
10780351	10781671	Our listeners rock, don't they?
10781871	10781971	Yeah.
10782311	10783112	Love you guys!
