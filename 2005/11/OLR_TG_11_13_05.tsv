129	2911	Orange Lounge Radio To Go Edition, week of November 14th, 2005.
3231	13638	You're tuned in to the Orange Lounge Radio To Go Edition, your podcast home for all the latest video game news and gamer chat.
13918	17421	Now, here are your hosts, DarkSakura, Sky, and Loki.
18942	21403	Hello everybody, once again.
21864	25406	Welcome to another episode of Orange Lounge Radio To Go Edition.
25885	30107	You're home from the latest gaming news about video games that don't suck.
30667	31888	All the news you really want to know about.
32428	34970	You know, once in a while, though, we do have to talk about games that do suck.
35510	37371	But just to remind you to avoid them.
37911	38731	My name is Rob Roberts.
38751	39712	You might know me as Sky.
39892	42773	Joining me tonight, the one and only Techmaster Loki.
43314	44114	Yep, it's me.
44414	44894	How you doing?
45495	45955	I'm doing good.
46488	54451	Alright, and DarkSakura, as we mentioned last week, she's been representing us at the Podcast Awards this weekend, so she is not able to be here with us tonight.
54751	61094	She'll be back next week for sure, but she did pass along a special message for everyone, and we'll be reading that a little bit later.
61674	74999	But we're going to start off tonight's show, and usually we start off with a little bit of How Was Your Gaming Week, but I want to change that a little bit tonight because I want to get this off my chest because I've kind of been thinking about this quite a bit this week, and I think I've decided that
75700	78402	I don't want to get an Xbox 360 on launch day anymore.
78662	88408	Like, I was all hyped up about getting the Xbox 360 the day it was coming out on launch day, and I was ready to fight those lines at Best Buy and Target or wherever I decided to end up going.
88448	90190	Toys R Us, which I think will probably be one of the best places.
90330	90810	Now I'm just like...
91510	97054	After reading about all these horrible, horrible delays and reading about... Now, Loki, didn't your system get delayed, in fact?
97474	98454	You were supposed to get one.
98494	99255	You reserved it months ago.
99375	100976	Yeah, but I have my theories on this, too.
101456	101756	Oh, yeah.
101776	102437	What do you think?
102877	103517	Here's my theory.
103537	104978	Before I continue to rant.
105018	108000	My theory is that they're not going to be as shorthanded as they think they are.
108500	112402	I think Microsoft purposefully told them they're getting less than they actually are.
112803	115264	So, okay, you pre-ordered 200 for your store.
115796	117678	They said, oh, well, you're only going to get 50.
117939	119901	They actually ship you 100 or something like that.
120261	124406	So those people that thought that they weren't going to get them, they got lucky and they got some.
124787	131535	So Microsoft looks like the hero now, but still they're still cutting them short and they still sell out and there's still the media hype about it.
131892	138157	Well, it's backfiring because I was interested, but after hearing about all the shortages, I'm like, do I really want to deal with this crap?
138557	141439	Do I really want the system that badly at launch?
141459	146583	And it kind of made me reevaluate what games are coming out at launch and after playing the kiosk and stuff.
146623	149585	And I'm not being anti-Microsoft with this statement.
149665	154749	I will get an Xbox 360 eventually, but I'm just going, do I really want to buy into this launch hype?
154789	157531	Is there any game that's coming out on launch day I really, really want?
157551	158912	And I'm thinking to myself, you know what?
159452	160753	No, there isn't.
161013	161853	I mean, I can wait.
161973	163634	I can wait until January or later.
163934	166996	And come to think of it, there's very few systems that I bought on launch.
167316	172418	The last one was the Nintendo DS, but before that, I can't really think of what system I probably bought on launch day.
172859	174119	So, it can wait.
174660	177121	But I know I've been kind of going back and forth on that for a while, so who knows.
177161	179182	I reserve the right to change my mind before...
179662	182184	Before the official D-Day in what, like nine days or so?
182204	183145	Something like that, yeah.
183165	187989	Well, it depends on what day you're listening to this podcast, but, you know, we're very little time left.
188310	196937	But I'm just like, you know what, for all that money, especially if they're going to be pushing me to buy, you know, two games out the door and everything, and all this, you know, all this other accessory crap, I'm just like, you know what, man?
196957	199159	They may be pushing you, but they're not going to require it.
199319	200360	And, you know...
201221	225414	I have my own qualms with I've read about how they're going to be doing this whole thing at Best Buy and how they like want you to buy all this stuff and they're hoping they spend $600 at their store well the hell with them I had the remember those free Best Buy bucks they had the money for from McDonald's and all that wonderful stuff well I like about $31 of this stuff so I was going to go buy a shot of Colossus there and just say hey okay cool I get the game for like three bucks or whatever
226599	226999	No!
227100	231123	You can only use $3 on a game, DVD, or CD.
231183	232444	I'm like, where does it say that on this?
232804	234025	Well, it doesn't say on this.
235026	236167	It's on the giant paper.
236447	237928	I'm like, what giant paper?
238929	240170	Do they want to see the giant paper?
240210	244914	It almost made me think I was going to go see The Wizard of Oz or something like that.
246175	247296	Oh, he wants to see the giant paper?
247536	248517	No, not the giant paper!
248797	250258	No one has to see the giant paper!
250598	250899	It's like...
251687	252127	What the hell?
252187	258870	So I basically went and got a spool of blank DVDs instead and I'm all, is this good enough for ya?
258890	260031	No, that's fine.
260091	261451	I'm like, shit, god.
262212	263953	Then I went and spent my money elsewhere.
265033	266294	But I did pick up shallow classes.
267247	268428	Well, don't derail my Xbox 360, dog.
268448	269428	Sorry, sorry.
269468	276952	No, I know, that's probably what every gaming podcast is going to talk about this week is Xbox 360, but I'm going to say I'm probably not going to buy it.
277232	285596	I've pretty much decided in my mind that my money is better spent on current Xbox, PlayStation 2, and GameCube games, and the 360 thing can wait until January.
286597	289944	I have tons of games pre-ordered.
289964	295755	I have four games pre-ordered right now with a possible fifth being pre-ordered later this week because I have store credit.
297529	298470	I'm gonna be getting the games.
298650	305838	In the system, I have a feeling I'm not gonna be waiting that much longer, even if it is not launch day, which I still think it probably is gonna be launch day.
306558	309942	I'm still gonna get one probably pretty soon, you know, whenever they decide to ship more.
310302	314527	So I'm not really that concerned about, you know, not being, you know, there.
314927	317289	I don't wanna wait in line, you know, in the morning and stuff.
317329	317770	You know what?
318210	318471	If I...
320075	327677	I let some kid who really wants the Xbox 360 for some game they've got to freaking have on the day when, you know what, I'm being nice.
327877	332759	I'm stepping aside because you don't want to see me with my claws out in the line waiting to get one of these systems.
332779	333539	So I'm being nice.
333899	334700	I'm stepping aside.
334720	338301	I will wait so one of you more eager kids can go get your Xbox.
338341	339461	See, I'm doing a nice thing here.
339681	344163	I mean, what GameStop told me is I have their pre-ordered mine back in May in order to get one.
344203	345283	That's before...
345703	345983	and so on.
366872	368073	I do want to mention this before.
368093	373614	I mean, this is a little bit of a news story, but it's kind of some late-breaking news that's coming in as we are taping, as we tape on Sunday nights.
374154	375815	And we're getting this story.
375875	378615	It's actually coming off of JoystickWithACue.com.
379175	381836	And they're saying that Circuit City is advertising on their website.
381856	388378	And you can actually see this on their website, CircuitCity.com, that they will be selling 360s on Friday at 2 p.m.
388518	389478	Eastern Standard Time.
389918	392599	Now, of course, the initial thought when you see this is, okay, whatever.
392779	415484	they're gonna sell it on their website and you know you order it on the website and they'll ship it to you by Tuesday or something right so it's not like they're really breaking the launch day but the weird thing is that this article says they actually called the customer service line and they spoke to a customer service rep and they're saying that every physical Circuit City location will be selling the console this Friday at 2 p.m.
415544	418045	Eastern and just to be sure they called back
418942	422444	and Double Checked just to make sure that they indeed were selling this.
422484	425485	And they said, yes, it will be available this Friday at 2 p.m.
426025	428506	Eastern Time online as well as at our stores.
428886	440372	So our thought was we'll call our local Circuit City and check, but unfortunately since we taped Sunday night and it's about 8.40 now, we missed the boat because they close at 8, so we didn't get a chance to call.
440672	442333	Did people still shop at Circuit City?
443453	444513	I bought my video card there.
444554	447575	There's still a fine store, you know.
448206	450528	Last thing I bought at Circuit City was your GameCube
475748	487251	I don't know, I have a feeling this might change by Monday, Tuesday when you guys are actually hearing this podcast, but this is something that's late-breaking, so keep an eye on CircuitCity.com if you want to try and beat the rush, so to speak.
487331	495354	Although, you know, with every gaming site reporting this, who knows, everybody and their sister is probably going to be lining up to get an Xbox 360 on Friday from Circuit City.
495514	499035	That's going to be a lot of interesting phone calls, if it isn't true.
500086	505648	Anyway, let's do a little bit of how is your gaming week, what games you've been playing this week, and what you're up to.
505949	507589	Loki, you mentioned Shadow of the Colossus?
508030	509410	Yes, I was playing that today.
510631	513492	I've gotten through already six of the Colossuses, and I think
514423	515803	The Colossus and The Camera
543689	547412	Because the camera does not want to freaking focus on anything correctly.
547552	552655	I have to constantly, you know, control it with the right analog stick while trying to fight this thing.
552715	554957	And there's a button to focus in on the Colossus.
554997	560101	Kind of like... It reminds me of Mega Man Legends where you can target stuff.
560241	561642	And that works really well.
562102	563583	This does not work very well.
564204	569267	Also, I get lost quite a bit trying to figure out where the hell I'm supposed to be going in this game.
569808	571429	And there's really nothing else, you know...
572839	573700	Thanks for watching!
589568	590929	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
608356	609276	I don't know, it was a really fun game.
609296	610997	Well, it sounds like it's a game you can really get into then.
611137	611437	Yeah.
611997	613778	Sometimes yelling at the TV makes it a really good game.
613798	614238	Well, I was frustrated.
614258	619760	I'm like, you know, because I'm trying to grab a hold of this one part of it, and it keeps grabbing some other part of it.
619780	622721	And I'm like, son of a bitch, do what I want you to do.
623461	625101	And so, it was kind of annoying.
625141	629783	But then, I don't know, I'll probably play through it and be done with it, and that's it.
631218	631699	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
644866	646507	I'm tempted to check that out.
646867	650069	I've not been that into Grand Theft Auto.
650109	657432	I understand why it does so well critically and commercially, but for me personally, it's not really my kind of game.
657692	661814	But I am kind of tempted to check out this PSP one, if for no other reason than I need more games for my PSP.
662534	663855	The multiplayer is the best part.
663875	664415	I love it.
664975	668597	This should have been something that they really had in all of them, I think.
669076	670058	Thank you for watching!
683579	685560	and just have it online and be able to play that way.
685600	689262	I think it'd be really fun, and you can get some really good tournaments and stuff going along.
690263	699447	I'm hopefully, in the next reiteration of this, which is coming out exclusively on the PS3, we'll have something multiplayer on it, because I think it really needs it.
699568	701248	Or even two-player co-op would be awesome.
702109	702529	Good ideas.
703890	705271	So anything else you've been playing besides those two?
705591	706011	That's it.
706031	709673	I've got a lot of stuff lined up for this week, but that's about it.
709713	711534	I've got Gun and Matrix.
712605	712925	Sounds good.
712965	713445	Path of Neo.
713485	713685	Yeah.
713865	715066	I've heard some good things about that game.
715546	716026	Looks good.
716826	718227	Then there's more stuff coming out this week.
718307	722628	I know, or it'll be Need for Speed Most Wanted's coming out.
723168	723929	I can already tell you.
725029	727670	Ultra Mix 3 is out this week and Mario Kart DS.
728223	728984	Yeah, I'm getting DS'd.
752731	754952	Oh hell yes, we'll see, we'll see, I'm excited.
755052	759155	This is, you know, this is a very interesting week if you think about it.
760916	768200	This is a huge week in that, this is almost epic in that this is where Nintendo is finally embracing online.
768700	777585	And granted, I mean, you could, you know, get me on little loopholes like, you know, okay, Phantasy Star Online for the GameCube, but let's face it, that was a Sega game.
777825	779066	It was established before the GameCube
806423	810504	I'm still waiting for their announcement on December 9th.
829688	830449	We'll get there in a little bit.
859708	860368	Thanks for watching!
878902	881724	I wish I knew about this when it was the arcades, but it was probably a small game.
882084	883706	So some little gems in there as well.
883746	888729	So if you're into the retro collection thing, a lot of good games for $20, I would recommend it for you.
889270	891952	If you're not into the retro collections, nothing here is going to win you over.
892032	896695	But, you know, Arcade Perfect Bubble Bobble on your console, it's pretty cool.
896995	898797	You know, unless you're already into the MAME thing.
898817	900178	But come on, support these guys a little bit.
900198	900458	It's $20.
901399	901839	Not that bad.
903106	906588	So, I know, that was a little short review of Tidal Legends, but what else can I really say about it?
906748	912872	And another game I got to check out, I went to a little party yesterday for a web forum I'm on, and got to check out some new games at this party.
913273	914954	Mario Party 7 being one of them.
915814	919537	And I don't even know if I can really review Mario Party 7, I mean, what the hell can I say about it?
920037	925241	You've seen 4, 5, 6 on the GameCube, and 3, 2, 1 before that on the Nintendo 64.
926321	927242	Yeah, it is eight players.
927282	933546	That was the first, because we actually played an eight-player game, and you used half the controller in the eight-player game, like you and a friend.
933586	935248	Hold on, so you have to get, you know, in close quarters.
935608	945475	But you and a friend each hold half the controller, and one of you uses the C-stick, the little yellow C-stick, and the right trigger, and then the other person uses the left analog controller and the left trigger.
945795	946416	So it works out.
946436	949157	You can do an eight-player, and you can do teams around the board.
949177	953701	So we even did an eight-player game around the board, and myself and Miklatov won, of
954500	955000	Thank you very much.
963884	966705	Anyway, but those guys are probably pissed off at me.
967465	968805	Anyway, no, we had a good time.
969165	971206	I mean, honestly, I don't know what else I can say about it.
971686	976147	You know, if you like these kind of Mario Party games, I don't think they make very good single player games at all.
976427	980148	So if you're the type of person that games by yourself, I don't think there's a whole lot here for you.
980308	983409	Although there are single player modes, but I don't know.
983489	984649	And there are, you know what?
984949	986169	There are some pretty cool mini games.
986189	988150	There was a couple of cool puzzle mini games.
989791	992492	This one where there were these balls.
992812	996875	It kind of reminded me of this old-ass arcade game I used to play at Golf Land called Battle Balls.
997255	998376	Did you ever remember this game?
998396	1002178	It was like a Japanese import game where it had these marbles that were falling and you had to stack them.
1002198	1002778	It was kind of like...
1003479	1003799	I don't know.
1003919	1004580	I can't even explain.
1004600	1005600	It's like a Tetris-type game.
1005900	1012524	Well, they have something like that in this, except it's a rotating sphere that you let the balls fall into.
1012664	1013825	So there's some kind of cool minigames.
1013845	1014325	So you know what?
1015126	1018968	I think there would be some cool stuff in here if you are a single player, you know, but...
1019788	1025930	To get the full potential of this game, you've got to be the type of person that has friends over a lot, or you've got a big family, so there's always somebody there to play the game with you.
1026310	1027851	I think you'd get more value out of it that way.
1028311	1031552	But it does seem to be a better Mario Party game than the last couple I played.
1031592	1038695	I didn't particularly enjoy 5 or 6 as much as 4, although most other people I've talked to say that 4 is the weakest.
1038935	1042356	That wasn't my personal opinion, but 7's a pretty solid entry.
1042376	1047218	So if you've kind of been lagging on the Mario Party series, 7's a good one to come back to, and it does have the microphone support again.
1048039	1054658	Other game I checked out was Karaoke Revolution Party Which I played a little bit at E3 But I got to see the full release of the game
1055160	1055881	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1079079	1094474	The version I played was on Xbox, and you can actually use your Xbox Live headset as a microphone, but the game also has a bundle that comes with a holding microphone if you want, but it actually gauges your pitch as a little arrow, so you can see exactly if you're tone deaf, the game will tell you honestly how you're doing.
1096596	1097457	So that's kind of how it works.
1097477	1101521	So I could see maybe a little bit of single player value and that you want to be a better singer, but
1101977	1113325	This is really more the kind of thing where, you know, again, if you have people around a lot, you're an entertainer type with your video games, you'd probably get a lot of value out of Karaoke Revolution Party because I'll tell you, at this party, it was a hit.
1113825	1119809	Everybody got on there and was doing the random medley because you can do little medleys of five songs and just do random.
1120089	1121290	So random songs would come up.
1121870	1126313	And the interesting thing about Karaoke Revolution Party is that the song list is very eclectic.
1126653	1130416	There really is something for everyone, which is a strong point and a weak point
1131997	1139701	The fact that there's something for everyone means that you really only really, really like like five or six songs on the list and then the rest you're kind of like, oh, I know that song.
1139781	1140461	Oh, I know that song.
1140901	1143103	It didn't really focus on one genre.
1143643	1148745	What I think is interesting about the Xbox version is that you can expand the song list via Xbox Live.
1149046	1160051	There are 100 songs available on Xbox Live for download and you can either download a block of five songs in a genre for $5 each or you can download the whole shebang, all 100 songs for $80.
1162148	1162768	Holy crap.
1162788	1163589	I don't know who'd want to spend $80.
1163729	1165770	That's really good.
1165870	1177938	Yeah, I mean, there's a lot of expansiveness to this game, so certainly the song list will not grow stale, but you're going to have to spend $80, maybe $100 to really expand it.
1178278	1184262	But, you know, if you're willing to spend $5 here, $5 there, you can at least buy the genres, because at least it breaks it out into genres.
1184282	1189306	You could buy, like, okay, if I want to buy all the rock packs, that would be like $10, you know, if you're more of a rock music fan.
1189326	1189666	So that's
1190206	1191687	Okay, that's cool.
1192487	1194048	I would recommend Karaoke Revolution.
1195468	1198189	Again, this is one of those games where you already know if this game is for you.
1198489	1204031	It is definitely the strongest Karaoke Revolution title to date because there's been three other volumes released.
1204071	1212435	This one has Create a Character, this one has the Sing and Dance mode, and both of those just really add to what was already a really unique game.
1212495	1215076	So, definitely the strongest entry in the series so far.
1215156	1216836	Check it out if you're a fan of the music games.
1217837	1218077	And so,
1218561	1219522	XBOX 360 Dominating the News
1240442	1268435	Compatibility list finally released over at Xbox.com Exactly which games they will be backwards compatible supporting And yes, it is apparently going to be using an emulator type thing Because only about 200 titles or so are emulatable Well, so far So far, and they say they are going to expand to it But you do notice a couple things that are missing right off the bat Such as Dance Dance Revolution Ultra Mix Some of the other things such as I noticed Midway Arcade Treasures wasn't on there
1269266	1270807	and some of the other, like, older Xbox titles.
1270827	1274350	There's some weird stuff on that list, that's all I gotta say.
1274430	1291543	But most, you know what, and I know a lot of people are saying this, like, why is Barbie on the list and, you know, these Aliens vs. Predator and some of these games that weren't standards, you know, and you have this alongside Halo 2, Halo, Fable, you know, all the games...
1292464	1297046	Ninja Gaiden, and all the games you would expect Xbox 360 to be emulating.
1298686	1306109	My thought is, is like, if you are familiar with emulating of games at all, like, for instance, take Nintendo emulation.
1306529	1307229	There's like
1308659	1309620	Thanks for watching!
1324133	1324954	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1340030	1343374	A game like Ultramix or something will probably take a little more effort.
1343434	1344135	That's my thought.
1344475	1352603	So that's why I'm not freaking out about the stuff that they picked to be on this list because obviously they went for their standards and they just haven't gotten around to the rest of it yet.
1352984	1362373	But another question was answered and that was if I bought premium content on the Xbox will I be able to transfer it over to the Xbox 360?
1363706	1366188	No, you will not be able to transfer it to the Xbox 360.
1366488	1375093	So don't shelve your Xbox console or sell it back just yet if you use your premium content that's on there because you will have to rebuy it on Xbox 360.
1375394	1377115	At least that's what we're hearing right now.
1377595	1378075	So far.
1378356	1382318	I mean, that might change later if they figure out a way to do certain things.
1383439	1384319	I somehow don't think it will.
1384700	1389703	Although, if you are a dance game fan, I did see on the list, Pump It Up, Exceed was on there, so...
1390302	1392582	That is one game you'll at least be able to play.
1393303	1398164	And I don't think that was Microsoft saying we prefer Pump It Up to DDR or any of that crap.
1398184	1401024	I think it's just, again, you get one game to work and Pump It Up worked as well.
1401064	1401764	Here's the problem, though.
1401784	1403285	How are you going to plug in the dance pad?
1404285	1404545	Oh!
1404565	1406325	Oh, good thought, good thought.
1406385	1407846	Is it not the same controller ports?
1408066	1409566	I assumed it was the same controller ports.
1409626	1412206	I don't really research some of these things.
1412506	1413687	There are no controller ports.
1414567	1416947	What about... No, there's a wired controller that you get in one pack.
1418248	1419108	Oh, duh.
1419488	1419868	Okay, I'm...
1420413	1422334	That makes too much sense for my feeble brain.
1422614	1430956	No, what they could do is a USB adapter, since the actual Xbox controllers are modified USB.
1430996	1434757	There's probably already an Xbox to USB, so people could use those things on their computer.
1435538	1437978	I'm not sure, though, the game would recognize, and that's a problem.
1438939	1440359	But, I don't know.
1440579	1443800	I'm sure this stuff will come out later, but at least it's available.
1443880	1444720	You can play it on the controller.
1445141	1445501	Woohoo.
1447588	1449390	Beatmania USA February 8th That's what Konami sent over to us so far.
1473214	1477276	Of course, you know, with the dates shuffling like crazy, that could move.
1477477	1481379	But that's what they've given us so far, and we actually have a solid date for it.
1481839	1483580	So, who knows?
1484401	1486262	But Tentative should be pretty cool.
1486422	1495467	And speaking of Beatmania, if you are the type that imports your Beatmania from Japan, like I did for a long time, Tentstyle is on its way out very, very soon.
1495527	1497548	I think it's next week as well.
1498829	1501871	Tentstyle has the song list up, and
1502151	1504653	What's very interesting is that there's a very interesting crossover in it.
1505473	1516479	Jelly Kiss, MidiHead's smack mix from Ultramix 3 is crossing over into 2DX10 style, which is interesting because if you follow the music gaming forums, people have been saying that MidiHead needs to be in 2DX for a long, long time.
1517500	1518941	And you know the other footnote I have to this?
1519841	1520001	Yeah.
1520141	1521522	MidiHead's going to be on the show next week.
1521542	1525044	We're going to have an interview with him, so I'm going to ask him exactly what he thinks about this.
1525104	1526185	We'll have MidiHead on next week's show.
1529095	1531156	Let's see, what else is going on here in the gaming world?
1531216	1535437	Let's talk about this, because this made me squee like a little fanboy.
1535537	1536557	It was beautiful.
1536797	1538098	I think I shed a tear over this.
1538538	1539998	I forgave Squeenix over this.
1540799	1542299	I'm going to sound like such a nerd, but I don't care.
1542699	1543319	Kingdom Hearts 2.
1544140	1546720	Did you see those pictures coming out of Famitsu Magazine?
1547020	1548221	I'm sorry, not Famitsu.
1548341	1548721	Just kidding.
1549161	1552142	Jump Magazine was the magazine that released this.
1553322	1555883	Kingdom Hearts 2 characters in Tron outfits.
1557057	1557457	Awesome.
1557757	1560459	Meaning that Tron is a level in Kingdom Hearts 2?
1561179	1562400	I forgive them for the delay.
1562440	1563461	They show stuff from Tron.
1563481	1564521	Yeah, they show screenshots and stuff.
1564601	1566102	It's great.
1566342	1566883	Very exciting.
1566943	1576849	I do like seeing them cross over into these other non-animated movie genres and stuff like that, like the Pirates of the Caribbean.
1576949	1578129	Did you hear about Steamboat Willie?
1578209	1581011	Somebody at the party yesterday was telling me about Steamboat Willie.
1581031	1581871	He's one of the stages, too.
1581931	1582492	I didn't know that.
1582932	1584113	Retro Mickey or something.
1584133	1585173	Yeah, old, old style.
1586314	1588637	Square Enix needs to get back with Nintendo
1604246	1607949	and the Nintendo characters and stuff and just make it like Nintendo RPG or something like that.
1608990	1618897	I would like to give another plea over to Squeenix because I'm sure Kingdom Hearts 3 is inevitable and I would just like to issue a friendly reminder to Squeenix that Disney now has the license to the Muppets.
1619758	1620298	Think about it.
1620959	1621279	Thank you.
1623661	1626203	Could be disastrous but it could be the greatest thing ever as well.
1626944	1627424	Think about it.
1627444	1628225	That's all I'm asking.
1628265	1628725	Think about it.
1629786	1629886	Ugh.
1630731	1631373	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1637867	1638407	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1663858	1668664	She just sent this over to me over text messenger, so I'm going to read this to you guys right now.
1668724	1670386	Her little report from LA.
1671708	1674431	She says, "...the drive to LA was a pain in the arse.
1674871	1677795	I've had a nasty cold and it's proceeded to get worse during the trip."
1678351	1682713	The next day was spent on homework in the two-hour drive to Ontario from Anaheim.
1683194	1685335	An hour of that was spent on the five alone.
1686035	1689357	Her friend Julie, Kasumi19, went with me on the adventure.
1689437	1694080	We arrived and met up with Frank of The Overnightscape, a podcast out of New Jersey.
1694540	1697561	He's a big gamer too, apparently, so we sat with him during the ceremony.
1698242	1701303	We also met someone from Madpod.com, sat with us too.
1702504	1705146	The issue when we tried to get in was that we didn't have badges.
1705346	1707647	I said, we're Orange Lounge Radio, we won an award.
1708120	1709420	They said, will you be here tomorrow?
1709720	1710281	She said, no.
1710381	1711521	And they said, fine, just go in.
1714282	1717603	Julie and her DarkSakura helped themselves to the free food.
1718063	1722664	And they sat there mesmerized by Adam Curry, who apparently was standing just a foot away from their table.
1723124	1726505	And I remember when I talked to Jamie on the phone, she didn't shut up about Adam Curry's hair.
1726665	1727605	So I thought that was funny.
1727885	1730346	And she would also like to say, for the record, he still looks fabulous.
1731181	1739685	Anyway, they let the first three awards winners talk, one being Mr. Curry himself, and then the People's Choice winners went up, had picks taken, and got shooed off.
1741345	1747708	We have a $25 Visa gift card and plastic trophy, pictures of which will be on the site soon.
1747788	1749789	Woohoo!
1749949	1749789	$25!
1750789	1752730	That's a higher budget than we've ever had for this show.
1752750	1755731	I thought we wanted some web design package or blog design.
1756532	1757152	I have no idea.
1758539	1759520	Did they chip us?
1759540	1761082	Did they jack our pride?
1761142	1762183	I don't care.
1762503	1763164	Whatever.
1763505	1764205	It's not a big deal.
1765707	1766949	Anyway, DarkSakura continues.
1767329	1774017	After that, I mostly hung around talking to Frank and was interviewed for his podcast, so I feel inclined to give his podcast a plug.
1774177	1775078	The Overnightscape.
1775439	1777761	www.theovernightscape.com
1778542	1782146	He's awesome and his podcast was one of the nominees in the political social talk, I believe.
1782266	1782926	Very cool guy.
1783447	1784648	At any rate, that's it for me.
1785069	1787171	I do have one bit of advice for the column tonight.
1787651	1791615	Don't try to park on a hill in Julian, California, because it is friggin' impossible.
1792035	1793377	And never trust directions.
1793857	1794097	Ever.
1794638	1795098	Get a map.
1795719	1796139	The end.
1798241	1801384	That from our very own DarkSakura, who will be back next week.
1803325	1804586	Thank you for watching!
1824020	1834746	Industry Insider Gaming, Steve, and his podcast over there, as well as RPG MP3, World's Largest Dungeon Audio Review, because they do awesome jobs on their podcasts as well.
1835087	1849195	We are all independent, and this is probably the only year where the nominees are going to read like that, because I bet you next year, with all the built-in audience that some of those corporate podcasts have, not to knock on the corporate podcasts, you know, they're doing a good thing for the community, 1UP and GameSpot and all them, but, you know...
1850046	1852770	Probably us indies are going to have a harder time standing out next year.
1852871	1855154	So guys, we're going to have to enjoy this while it lasts.
1855435	1858440	So congratulations to you guys as well for being nominated.
1860082	1863227	But you know, how much Mountain Dew do you think it takes to get through the world's largest dungeon?
1863247	1863989	That's what I'm curious about.
1865178	1867060	I don't know, but they have that new energy drink now.
1867140	1868001	That's true.
1869362	1870203	Who was it?
1870263	1872105	Someone that we knew was up 48 hours.
1872345	1875368	Oh, VX... Oh, yeah.
1875689	1877010	Was up like 48 hours?
1877050	1879032	Yeah, 48 hours with that stuff.
1879052	1880313	I'm sure they drink a lot.
1880433	1882395	I tease because I love.
1882636	1882916	All right.
1884197	1884678	Moving on.
1885916	1888277	This is something about Nintendo that's pissed me off for a long time.
1888977	1891038	But this plays into something you were talking about last week.
1891338	1896001	You know how I've been pissed off that Nintendo's not going to support the rev- er, not- Nintendo's not going to support the revolution.
1896361	1899022	Nintendo's not going to support HD with the revolution.
1899062	1901823	And as somebody who recently bought an HD TV, that kind of pissed me off.
1902103	1905585	Because I wanted to see Nintendo kind of embrace the HD technology like everyone's doing.
1906165	1911768	And there was kind of this, they said this a long time ago, but there were rumors just very recently that they were going back on this.
1911908	1913328	Well, here's the thing.
1913748	1922312	There was an interview on CNN Money, and they chatted with Nintendo of America Executive VP of Sales and Marketing, Reggie Fils-Aime.
1923012	1930696	And he said that what we'll offer in terms of gameplay and approachability will more than make up for the lack of HD.
1933126	1937097	And I'm thinking, shit, this just buys into what Loki said last week about the stereoscope in 3D.
1937518	1938320	It all makes sense.
1939261	1942022	They can't do it on an HD TV, that's why they're not going to support it.
1942783	1949586	Because then it goes on to say that when you have the HD support, you have really long loading times as well.
1949846	1952827	And I kind of noticed that Halo kind of seems to load a little longer than it used to.
1953247	1956849	I don't know, maybe it's just I'm insane, but it seems to have a slightly longer load time.
1956929	1962192	I don't mind waiting a little bit longer for pretty games, but maybe this all buys into what you were saying.
1962212	1962752	We'll find out.
1963112	1964232	We'll find out early December.
1964413	1965033	I think it'll be cool.
1965899	1966219	We'll see.
1966859	1967960	Loki, what do you have for us tonight?
1968460	1969440	A couple things.
1970280	1974861	First thing will be kind of... Let's see here.
1975502	1981803	My favorite topic of discussion is how hackers have broken the PSP.
1983224	1988345	And Sony's really having trouble with their copy protection stuff this week with the whole CD...
1989264	1990104	DRM Rootkit
2008440	2010262	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
2037848	2038949	PSP3D.com PSP3D.com PSP3D.com
2064328	2069491	They actually had a version of that exploit that they converted into a save file.
2069551	2079156	So basically, you load this save file either in a game or just in their save file browser thing there to actually be able to launch this.
2079276	2081998	And there's a bootbin file where you can launch your own code.
2082418	2088101	So in theory, this should work to be able to run a downgrader later on or...
2088999	2089859	Something to that effect.
2090419	2094020	Of course, a new firmware update is expected.
2094280	2099042	And I believe the new thing that they're adding with the new firmware is going to be e-book reader.
2099262	2101022	I actually saw the story on this.
2101342	2102023	Okay, that's cool.
2103163	2103883	Be interesting.
2104143	2105264	I think it's kind of pointless.
2105744	2109345	Maybe a web browser with, I don't know, Java support would be nice.
2109365	2110085	Okay.
2110685	2111025	But, yeah.
2112145	2113366	So, that's that.
2113586	2117447	The other thing that was kind of cool is they were showing some screenshots of the Gradius...
2118263	2120245	Grotius Collection that's going to be coming out.
2120345	2120946	That's exciting.
2120966	2121947	I think that looks really sweet.
2121987	2123369	That's definitely a PSP game I've got to check out.
2123889	2124750	So it's going to be nice.
2125151	2133620	They showed both the kind of pan and scan version of the old games and then the widescreen version, which is kind of neat.
2134841	2136802	DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
2159284	2160986	Well, bow down to the DDR King.
2162067	2163388	Hey guys, love the podcast.
2163428	2166211	Helps to make my workday fly by like I am high on drugs.
2167352	2173958	Now I know you are all addicted to the Bomani games as much as me, and here is where you can flaunt your geekness and help me out all at the same time.
2174419	2175900	Dance Dance Documentary.
2176401	2178363	Where or where do I find it?
2178743	2179584	Help a honky out.
2180936	2181837	You know, I googled it.
2182437	2183078	I couldn't find it.
2183258	2185879	I have no idea where you can get this movie.
2186220	2192284	And I'm telling you, I was interviewed for some movie that they were doing on DDR, and I don't know if this is the same one or not.
2192864	2196267	I think it was, and it never came to be.
2196367	2198088	No, if you go to Internet Movie Database...
2198889	2199630	This is one thing I like.
2199670	2202893	You can actually see Dance Dance Documentary on Internet Movie Database.
2203114	2204535	And this is what I really wanted to talk about.
2204856	2209261	Sorry buddy, I don't know where you can get this movie because I cannot find a website where they are selling this movie.
2209821	2215488	But I was drawn to this entry on Internet Movie Database because it actually has like a full entry here and a review.
2215948	2217349	And it's like, what's going on?
2217369	2219350	It doesn't show your name as one of the actors.
2219490	2224874	No, but it shows other people that we know very well, like Mel B and some of the other people in the community.
2224914	2228116	They're all listed here, and they have internet movie database entries.
2228176	2228877	How cool is that?
2228917	2236902	Like, you could click on Mel here and get to his whole page, almost like he's a card-carrying member of the Screen Actors Guild now or something.
2237262	2237763	That's kind of fun.
2237783	2238023	I don't know.
2238043	2238703	That cracked me up.
2239063	2241805	As a longtime member of the Bomani community, this cracked me up.
2245828	2246128	Oh, yeah.
2274501	2278123	Even though we've been doing this for, you know, what, three and a half years?
2278143	2279204	Let's go on to another email.
2279464	2280284	We have another email.
2281585	2288509	It's our buddy Deakman saying, Hi, I'm back from Canada and have just finished catching up on the last month or so worth of shows.
2288969	2293672	I heard you guys read out some release lists for the US and the UK, but nothing for Australia.
2294588	2295449	So he sent us a link.
2295469	2298631	And, you know, checking out the Frapper, you know, we were plugging the Frapper last week.
2299031	2301974	I didn't realize, like, every freaking podcast out there has a Frapper.
2302154	2306257	Because, like, now this week I'm looking at other sites and, like, put yourself on the Frapper.
2306317	2307138	Put yourself on the Frapper.
2307178	2307998	I'm like, oh, wow.
2308198	2310900	We apparently jumped on this bandwagon way late.
2310960	2311821	But it's still cool.
2312001	2313983	So put yourself on the Frapper for Orange Lounge.
2314363	2316925	But looking at the Frapper, we have some pins in Australia.
2317245	2319187	So we got to recognize our Aussie fan base.
2319207	2322469	The only thing I don't like about the Frapper is I can't actually put myself where I live.
2322509	2323290	Instead, it's just...
2323550	2324171	Matrix, Pathineo
2345749	2347672	Also same day, Soul Calibur 3.
2348453	2352759	Coming out on 25th November, Shadow the Hedgehog and the Capcom Classics Collection.
2353139	2354962	And then we go into the December.
2355022	2363193	We have 1st of December, you guys are getting WWE Smackdown vs. Raw, which honestly I never really got into the wrestling games, but I know some folks are into them, so whatever.
2363773	2366295	Prince of Persia 3, Two Thrones on 8th of December.
2366355	2367115	Now, that'll be pretty cool.
2367455	2370397	Sega Classics Collection, you guys are finally getting on 10th of December.
2370777	2375060	And then on into 2006, you guys will be getting Oz, which I don't even think we're getting here.
2375560	2378882	You guys are getting that on 28th of February, so feel lucky about that one.
2379222	2382164	And then on March 13th, you guys are getting Godfather.
2382305	2384106	Of course, that all being on the PlayStation 2.
2384887	2386168	You want to go to some other systems.
2387008	2391412	Over in Australia, you guys are getting King Kong for the Xbox on 17th of November.
2391512	2393373	Half-Life 2 on 21st of November.
2394134	2399198	And if you go to some other systems such as the GameCube, Pokemon XD this week on 15th of November.
2399778	2402761	And Fire Emblem Path of Radiance on 1st of December.
2403441	2407084	And over on the DS, you guys are getting Burnout Legends on the 12th of December.
2407700	2410701	and Phoenix Wright, Ace Attorney, 28th of February.
2410761	2416603	I like how sometimes they get games before us like King Kong isn't here until the week of the 21st.
2418504	2420205	Just interesting the way it works out sometimes.
2421462	2422543	Thank you for watching.
2422583	2423123	See you next time.
2443337	2447420	He actually got to go to the show in Vancouver, so he wants to share what was going on.
2447460	2450123	He said the show was great, great sound, great lighting.
2450523	2451844	The production values were great.
2451984	2453765	Each piece was accompanied by game footage.
2454006	2455247	It was an incredible combination.
2455547	2458309	The show started with what they called classic arcade medley.
2458629	2466856	This segment started with the primitive beeps and boops from games like Pong, Space Invaders, and Defender, and then transitioned into the games with some sorts of music in it like Donkey Kong.
2467276	2467696	Okay, good.
2467716	2469417	That doesn't sound as hokey as I thought that was going to be.
2469577	2472477	So I'm really glad that that was the way they opened.
2472497	2473778	That sounds cool.
2474238	2478659	Lastly, they played music from the classics with true orchestration like Dragon's Lair and Outrun.
2479339	2488081	They proceeded to play music from games like Metal Gear Solid, Zelda, God of War, Beyond Good and Evil, Castlevania, Myst, Warcraft, Advent Rising, Halo, etc.
2489061	2491082	The show was an astounding orchestral experience.
2491182	2493862	I believe that both gamers and non-gamers would enjoy it equally.
2494222	2496403	It's too bad that they had to cancel most of their shows.
2496883	2501405	So, a positive review of this show coming to us from Edmund.
2501806	2506348	Again, if you want to send us an email, 2go at orangeloungeradio.com is the place to send it.
2506948	2510130	And we hope we'll be reading your email on a future podcast.
2510630	2511531	For now, back to the news.
2511591	2512411	Loki, what do you got for us?
2512932	2513512	Okay.
2514953	2516193	The other things I was going to be mentioning.
2516213	2519055	There's a ton of stuff, of course, with the 360 launch going on.
2519635	2521596	Some things I found really funny.
2522117	2523577	The first one being, of course...
2524858	2527700	The golden tickets that are being given out at Walmart, I think those are just hilarious.
2534218	2539782	Apparently, this is one of those things, you know, they're going to be handling theirs, you know, first-come, first-served type line thing.
2539822	2540622	But you get a ticket.
2541203	2544665	What's great about the thing, though, is the tickets are a little bit confusing.
2544705	2548207	They are for the opposite of the, you know, colored box that they're supposed to be.
2548247	2552870	So the green tickets are for the white box, and the white tickets are for the... Oh, that won't cause any confusion at all, I'm sure.
2552890	2554111	Oh, actually, no, I take that back.
2554131	2554431	I'm sorry.
2554451	2555612	They're for the same boxes.
2556112	2558494	However, their little form tells them what...
2559194	2560134	and ones which.
2560674	2564175	The white box is going to be the $2.99 and the green box being $3.99.
2564855	2569936	Of course, for all those who are pre-ordering those, those are completely opposite.
2570076	2576838	So some people hopefully will be getting their systems for $100 less than they would have to be paying, which I think is quite funny.
2578398	2584219	The other thing which is interesting, and this is completely on a different subject here.
2585920	2587480	Actually, same subject.
2588012	2589714	Xbox 360 Zero Hour.
2589754	2592757	It's an event that's going on in the Mojave Desert.
2593698	2595720	I wanted to see if we could go to that.
2596641	2599364	Real work calls.
2599824	2605110	In order to get a ticket, they were doing this Blitz thing on Thursday where you would have
2605956	2609978	I believe there's like 12 sites participating, all the major gaming sites.
2612399	2615301	Basically, they were giving out... What do you mean all the major gaming sites?
2615421	2616242	We weren't in on it.
2616702	2619543	Yeah, but we don't have an actual huge budget like they do, okay?
2619703	2621424	No, we have $25 now, remember?
2622005	2623005	Oh, I'm sorry.
2623225	2624366	We have a $25 budget now.
2624606	2633671	No, anyways, so they were giving out... I believe each site was giving out about 360 tickets, and then the rest of them were going to be randomly drawn...
2634251	2635512	Actually, Monday.
2636753	2639376	So, we'll find out who gets to go.
2639396	2648023	3,000 people, including VIPs, which will be contest winners from the Origin website and, of course, the Hex168 site.
2648583	2654008	We'll be going there, and you'll be greeted with 48 hours of pure gaming fun.
2654028	2656870	So, is this like Burning Man with more games and less nudity?
2657551	2657811	Yeah.
2657951	2659712	Okay.
2659832	2661914	And celebrities who really have no point being there.
2662094	2662254	But...
2663836	2670562	And you'll also get to buy your Xbox 360 a whole couple hours earlier than everybody else.
2683080	2686423	This just feeds into what I was talking about at the beginning of the cast, why I'm not doing this.
2686583	2688224	Why I'm just not going to do it anymore.
2688825	2689765	Well, here's why.
2689825	2693989	It makes sense when you find out why they're trying to force games on you.
2694489	2702817	In order to be able to have Xboxes at launch, you have to promise Microsoft you're going to do $10 million in business by the end of the year.
2703337	2703977	Or else what?
2704978	2705379	Or else...
2707236	2708877	Or else what, they're going to slap you on the wrist?
2709657	2713439	What, you're going to give a severe penalty to a big company like Best Buy?
2713979	2716741	Crap, if I were a company like that, I'd pull your crap off my shelves.
2716781	2718782	Good luck selling your damn system under these rules.
2720182	2723084	I'm just some gaming fan with a little podcast.
2723464	2726906	Maybe I don't understand the bigger scope of things, so I'm sure I'll get emails on that.
2726926	2729967	You have to understand, they don't care.
2730067	2731508	You're nobody to them.
2733269	2734129	My money, damn it!
2734574	2735315	I should be somebody.
2735395	2736516	The customer is always right.
2736896	2743861	Anywho, in other news, I will file air the... It was bound to happen sooner or later.
2744802	2748505	Nintendo is talking about possibly redesigning the DS.
2751409	2752530	Oh, so I can buy it again?
2752710	2753271	Yeah!
2753291	2755953	Oh, just like how there's like 50 different Game Boys out there I could buy?
2756233	2756814	Exactly.
2756834	2757755	Oh, what a shock.
2758336	2764602	So yeah, Reggie fills, I mean, dropped a hint that the DS may be due for a redesign.
2765843	2768906	Basically, yeah, it's not a surprise.
2768946	2772850	They're going to make it sleeker, I guess, and smaller, and yadda yadda yadda yadda.
2775017	2775738	Not a big surprise.
2776818	2778038	Alright, I got a story over here.
2778439	2781280	NCSoft, you know NCSoft, they make Guild Wars.
2781940	2786662	NCSoft is saying that they are going to be working on a console game.
2787262	2795445	Chief Executive Tak Jin Kim mentioned that they were developing for the next generation consoles, but they're not saying exactly what they're doing.
2795505	2801468	But if you think about it, well, they do MMOs, so that would seem like the most logical thing they're going to put out.
2802168	2802248	Um...
2802768	2803228	But who knows?
2803308	2803949	Anything is possible.
2803989	2808391	And I would think if they're going to put out an MMO, Xbox 360 is probably going to be where they gravitate to.
2808491	2809192	But who knows?
2809452	2810613	Anything is possible at this juncture.
2810993	2812794	But we do know NCSofts will be developing something.
2813354	2815455	I thought they'd launch this port Guild Wars to the console.
2815496	2817957	I bet a lot of people might get a kick out of that.
2818017	2819158	But what do I know?
2819718	2821119	Again, I'm just some guy.
2822317	2826943	for those people who like to play games on their computer that they shouldn't be playing.
2827023	2828044	Shame, shame, shame.
2828084	2828925	What, emulators?
2829085	2829505	Yeah, anyways.
2830246	2835492	So there was a long-awaited mod that takes Legends of the Ocarina of Time
2835993	2838333	and updates the graphics with high res textures.
2838413	2839854	Well, it's finally out, folks.
2840294	2844254	Of course, you will need the raw man emulator to play it.
2844835	2855797	Anyways, you can definitely find this link at 4colorrebellion.com and it's one of the posts that they put on there from today, actually.
2856417	2857177	November 13th.
2858157	2859217	So that's kind of interesting.
2859517	2863998	I personally didn't get to play Ocarina of Time, even though I had the disc for the GameCube, you know, the
2865134	2866215	Here's the weird thing.
2866575	2871497	I understand that Ocarina of Time is a treasured game.
2871557	2876299	When you ask people, what is your favorite game of all time, Ocarina of Time almost always comes near the top of the list.
2877080	2879200	I did not get as into this Zelda.
2879561	2883142	I'm in some category by myself sometimes, I feel like.
2883262	2884163	I did not get into it.
2884483	2888665	And I don't know if it's the 3D thing that really just threw me that I never was able to get over, but...
2889662	2896428	I just keep going back to the Super Nintendo Zelda, you know, and how freaking wonderful that game was linked to the past.
2896909	2898650	And just to me, nothing compares to that.
2898750	2902374	I don't even know if this new Zelda will compare to linked to the past to me.
2902414	2906818	But at the same time, the new Zelda looks very, very sexy.
2906858	2908780	So maybe all will be forgiven, but we'll see.
2909620	2910561	It'll be interesting.
2910661	2911282	Anything else, Loki?
2911966	2913307	Um, yeah, a couple more things.
2913648	2926418	Um, first, of course, the game I've been, um, watching closely, Project Gotham Reason 3, I actually watched, they had this 25 minute video discussing, like, all the details that went into the graphics, the physics, and everything, and the game looks amazing.
2926958	2930041	But, apparently, it might not truly be high def.
2930821	2931702	Big freaking whoop.
2932263	2937687	Um, but, apparently, um, there was a test version of the game that was shipped out to, um,
2938274	2942057	A reviewer, and they actually did a screen cap of it straight from the machine.
2943458	2945359	Anyways, dumping the graphic buffer or something like that.
2945980	2950163	And it's 1024x600 instead of 1024x720.
2950223	2951184	Big friggin' whoop.
2951404	2954206	So it's not that, you know, the exact same detail.
2954566	2955707	The game looks amazing, though.
2955967	2957889	But, you know, of course, it's controversy, you know.
2958755	2959055	and so on.
2974008	2989917	or actually I should say Activision signed a deal with Marvel extending their partnership for another 12 years or so basically allowing them to make games until 2017 using the licenses of Marvel and it's going to be exclusive with them so
2990540	2994681	You'll see wonderful games such as more Spider-Man and more X-Men games coming out.
2994741	2998883	Not to say that they don't do bad games, because the Ultimate Spider-Man was really good.
2998963	3000723	I heard very, very good things about that Spider-Man game.
3000763	3001503	I didn't play it myself.
3001964	3005225	And X-Men Legends 2 was supposed to be pretty good, too.
3005505	3007665	See, X-Men Legends 1 disappointed the hell out of me.
3007825	3011146	I was not a big fan of it, but I have heard that 2 is much better, so we'll see.
3011166	3013507	2 is much better because you don't have to unlock multiplayer.
3013547	3014507	That was retarded.
3014528	3017809	I remember when we got that game, we were just like, oh, yeah, let's play multiplayer.
3018029	3019069	Oh, wait, we can't.
3021729	3024971	Speaking of Activision, I just wanted to drop this out there.
3025031	3027713	Quake 4 is going to be a 360 launch title.
3027753	3028634	It is coming out in time.
3029294	3036658	And with all the news about all these games getting pushed back, I suppose it would be refreshing for a change if you're an Xbox 360 fan to hear that Quake 4 will be dropping at launch.
3036798	3038159	It was going to be dropping at launch.
3038179	3039620	That was originally the case.
3039700	3041121	It was supposed to be on the 21st.
3041321	3042442	I heard now it's going to be the 18th.
3042802	3043902	It is the 18th.
3043922	3047683	I just wanted to say that it has been confirmed by the studio it is happening.
3048284	3050524	Eight player support over Xbox Live.
3050824	3051424	Just an FYI.
3052565	3053305	That's really cool.
3053845	3058506	And it also has been reported that DOA 4 is actually pushed back to December now.
3058646	3058926	See?
3059667	3062067	That was the game I was looking forward to more than any other.
3062327	3068169	But for now, before we all jump the gun here, it was only pushed back a week.
3068269	3069329	It's December 1st.
3071090	3071410	Big whoop.
3071450	3072030	I mean, it's like
3072386	3073167	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3097332	3099573	There's tons of stuff, and I can wait seven days for a game.
3099613	3101314	I mean, you're going to be picking up launch games anyways.
3101354	3102955	You don't need to have six games at launch.
3103895	3106596	Well, I do, but, you know, that's just me.
3108037	3110838	I'll still be playing Mario Kart DS for the next three weeks, hopefully.
3111238	3111818	Oh, hell yes.
3112039	3116601	I have to dominate the rankings for that.
3116621	3117621	Good luck.
3118021	3118561	Good luck.
3118581	3126325	There are some sick, sick, sick Nintendo fanboys that will beat you up really bad online, and some of them are probably listening and can't wait to kick your ass.
3127071	3128352	All will be answered very soon.
3156184	3159405	It's still going to be all drama this entire week is basically it.
3160005	3163505	But yeah, that's pretty much what I've got.
3164005	3164726	Just that stuff.
3165166	3166406	Quake 3 for the Pocket PC.
3167666	3168966	But who owns a Pocket PC?
3168986	3173247	Who really wants to play Quake 3 on a Pocket PC anyway?
3173607	3175568	Well, who wants to run Linux on a DS?
3175628	3176528	But they do it anyway.
3178048	3179388	Well, okay, it does make homebrew possible.
3179448	3180048	I take that back.
3180088	3183549	And in the story of it's really been a slow news week...
3184590	3186712	People have been reporting on numerous websites.
3186772	3191576	When you pop in Cameo on your Xbox, it says put in Xbox 360, dumbass.
3192517	3195800	Not really, but it basically says this is meant to be played on.
3196240	3199803	So that's what people do with their games that they buy before the console is out.
3199883	3201284	I wondered why people did that.
3201424	3202646	Okay, all is answered.
3202686	3203046	Thank you.
3203286	3207047	All other things, you know, from, you know, instruction manuals being online for the 360.
3207148	3212069	I mean, people are just dying to get anything, you know.
3212289	3213570	I'm sick of the hype.
3213670	3214210	I'm sorry.
3214350	3217671	I'm not trying to be anti-Xbox here, but I am sick of the hype.
3218232	3220212	You know if you want the damn system or not by now.
3220533	3221373	Have fun if you do.
3222113	3223834	Have fun waiting if you don't or whatever.
3223894	3225614	I'm just, I'm done.
3226995	3227815	I got one more story.
3228155	3228416	Go ahead.
3228556	3229536	One last story for tonight.
3232537	3249565	Kata Takahashi, who created Katamari Damacy, gave an interview with the BBC this week and said that he probably doesn't really want to be doing gaming for the rest of his life.
3249705	3253267	He's actually imagining developing a playground for children.
3254238	3258539	So he's not really into doing video games for the rest of his life.
3258579	3267162	But I'm just reminded of how Kojima always says he's not going to do another Metal Gear Solid and then the next year, oh, just kidding, here's another one.
3268462	3268782	I don't know.
3269482	3277464	I think we should be forcing him to stay on video games because I'm kind of afraid this will kind of plague around equipment he's going to come up with.
3278585	3282686	God damn, I mean, we don't actually need a physical Katamari out there.
3282746	3282886	It's
3283578	3284179	That's scary.
3284760	3286984	That's it.
3287024	3287645	That's all from me.
3287665	3288106	Anything else?
3288206	3289208	Any last minute stories, Loki?
3289628	3290330	I got nothing.
3290810	3292814	It's going to be more of the same next week, I'm sure.
3293074	3295499	More games, more fun, more drama.
3295599	3296039	Can't wait.
3297577	3298418	We got a fun month ahead.
3298438	3301158	The next six weeks are going to be a blast because we got the holiday season.
3301178	3302819	Oh, it's going to be insane.
3303099	3304280	And you know what?
3304480	3311402	I actually signed on to Final Fantasy XI to update it, and that's about it.
3311422	3314663	And I looked at the date that I last played it five months ago.
3315423	3317864	And you've been paying, let's see, five times.
3317884	3318925	How much do you pay him on?
3318945	3320245	$12.95 or do you have another character?
3320265	3320985	I have another character.
3321005	3321606	All right, so you paid $13.95, $14.95.
3321666	3322406	You paid $70 for nothing.
3326027	3327328	I'm sure the fiancé is very pleased.
3328608	3329048	Whatever.
3329248	3330589	You know, I really don't care.
3331149	3331929	I will play.
3332230	3333730	I will play by the end of this month.
3334611	3335411	Mark my words.
3338192	3339352	I played World of Warcraft yesterday.
3340113	3340953	I just don't have time.
3341013	3344294	I have certain games I have to play during the week.
3344314	3345715	I have to play like everything comes out.
3345955	3346675	Oh, you poor thing.
3346735	3347876	Having to play video games.
3348036	3349136	I have Ninja Turtles.
3349637	3350437	I haven't played that yet.
3351654	3353115	Well, maybe we'll hear a review on that next week.
3353435	3354675	For now, that's the show.
3354695	3355516	We're pushing an hour.
3355576	3356016	We're done.
3356436	3357236	That's it for tonight's show.
3357296	3358757	Next week, we'll have MiniHead on the show.
3358777	3359697	We're going to ask him questions.
3359717	3360357	It'll be a good time.
3361438	3362698	Final thoughts, Loki?
3363559	3366620	I hope Mario Kart DS is going to friggin' rock.
3367740	3369981	You know, that's my exact same final thought.
3370021	3376163	Mario Kart DS, please, dear Nintendo, please do not screw up your online capabilities.
3376383	3377784	But I have faith it's going to work.
3378123	3380428	I think it's going to be an exciting era for the DS.
3380448	3383013	Then Animal Crossing DS in a few weeks after that.
3383634	3384015	That's right.
