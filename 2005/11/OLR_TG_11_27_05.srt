doctor's telling you every week it's something different or something right

13
00:00:58,900 --> 00:01:03,560
it was a cold that turned into a sinus infection while I was in LA because I

14
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:08,560
came back really sick right and then he told he told me it was bronchitis but a

15
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:12,480
chance that it was pneumonia and he put on my thing pneumonia and I had an x-ray

16
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:16,200
and all that and this week he's telling me it's whooping cough or it might be

17
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:19,800
he's taken the cultures he stuck a q-tip up my nose you

18
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:23,640
I was gross it tickled I wanted to sneeze well well you're back and I know

20
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:29,720
listeners have said they've missed you so as I'm sure you've seen in the mail

21
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:34,320
bag so is there a man proving they're trying some people out there haven't

22
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:37,880

23
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:42,560
them Loki's here as always say hello to Loki I'm here no whooping cough for Loki

24
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:49,640
No, no, I can't arrange for you to get the plague. How you doing Loki? I'm doing good. Yes

25
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:54,200
Yes, I'm doing I could be doing better how to have 360 but

26
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:58,340
I'm still doing good crazy stuff with the 360 launch, huh?

27
00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:02,960
You know nothing I didn't expect. All right, well, we'll talk about 360 stuff

28
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:06,760
But of course, it's very important to us because you know, we're casual show here

29
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:07,680
We don't really you know

30
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:10,000
We're not and we do whatever the heck we want here

31
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,280
And one thing we like to do is tell you about what we've been playing because we are gamers as well

32
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:17,160
We don't have companies that send us a lot of free stuff

33
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:22,600
So we have to go out and buy games ourselves and you know, we have real life that you know

34
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:27,200
We have jobs and stuff, but we do fit in time for gaming when we can dark soccer

35
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:31,480
Have you been able to fit in any time for gaming? I know you've been sick, but what even playing if anything I played

36
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:34,740
I played some Katamari last night

37
00:02:34,740 --> 00:02:40,100
a new one or the old one but I got motion sick because my stomach was

38
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:45,620
already feeling irritated I turned on World of Warcraft and then shut it back

39
00:02:45,620 --> 00:02:51,420
down again because I couldn't stand it's just like because I've been so

40
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:55,500
disoriented it's been driving me crazy to play anything so I've been taking it

41
00:02:55,500 --> 00:03:01,020
kind of easy with gaming however I did play some PSO blue burst while I was in

42
00:03:01,020 --> 00:03:07,660
L.A., and did watch somebody play through a couple of quests on the Xbox.

43
00:03:07,660 --> 00:03:10,140
And did you get a chance to check out Xbox 360?

44
00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:11,860
Uh, yes, actually.

45
00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:15,920
I didn't play it because I just wasn't feeling well enough, but I got to see Perfect Dark

46
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:23,140
Zero, which I thought was pretty cool, and then Call of Duty, and then Project Gotham

47
00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:28,140
Racing, and Dan's been playing a whole lot of Need for Speed Underground, so I've actually

48
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:30,220
seen quite a bit of that.

49
00:03:30,220 --> 00:03:37,140
And he compared it between Xbox and Xbox 360 and said that the 360 version really just

50
00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:38,460
seems like a port.

51
00:03:38,460 --> 00:03:39,580
It's lower.

52
00:03:39,580 --> 00:03:41,780
Not as much fun as the Xbox version.

53
00:03:41,780 --> 00:03:42,780
Interesting.

54
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:48,020
And I got to see the BSOD on the Xbox 360.

55
00:03:48,020 --> 00:03:49,140
Not the blue screen of death, but...

56
00:03:49,140 --> 00:03:50,820
The black screen of death!

57
00:03:50,820 --> 00:03:51,820
Hahaha.

58
00:03:51,820 --> 00:03:52,820
Alright.

59
00:03:52,820 --> 00:03:55,740
What caused the black screen of death, my ass?

60
00:03:55,740 --> 00:04:01,180
I think it just got hot, but it was it was on the same game that I'm hearing most of the complaints about is on

61
00:04:04,580 --> 00:04:06,580
Call of Duty 2 no on

62
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:10,940
Project Gotham 3 as I say it's one of the racing games if I remember right yeah

63
00:04:10,940 --> 00:04:17,060
In fact one of our listeners had actually sent us an article about that, but I was gonna say from experience

64
00:04:17,060 --> 00:04:21,320
I've seen it happen, and it was on that game and most of the people I talked to said that it is on

65
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:28,580
and I want to say GTA but it's it's a project Gotham but aren't they saying

66
00:04:28,580 --> 00:04:32,860
that it's all related to the power supply basically and I know that it's

67
00:04:32,860 --> 00:04:36,740
overheating I don't know exactly why but most of people who run into the problems

68
00:04:36,740 --> 00:04:44,180
are playing with their game in a cabinet I know that's a common factor hmm

69
00:04:44,180 --> 00:04:49,220
anything else you want to share with us dark soccer not particularly all right

70
00:04:49,220 --> 00:04:52,220
Does she want to hear the details of my illness? I doubt think so.

71
00:04:52,220 --> 00:04:54,220
Uh, maybe on another show. Uh, Loki.

72
00:04:54,220 --> 00:05:03,220
Uh, well, I've been, um, I take a little time off this week because of my car and being broken, so...

73
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:09,220
Meanwhile, while that was being worked out, I've been playing Mario Kart DS, and that's really fun.

74
00:05:09,220 --> 00:05:11,220
Um, I do not like snaking.

75
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:16,220
Snaking is retarded, and it's a really stupid aspect of the game where people just basically...

76
00:05:16,220 --> 00:05:19,220
you saw the same thing in F-Zero GX where people

77
00:05:19,220 --> 00:05:23,580
they wiggle their cart back and forth or whatever using the drifting or whatever

78
00:05:23,580 --> 00:05:27,560
and it makes it go super fast, a little faster than it should be going in the game

79
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:31,820
and it's kinda pointless. It's a way of cheating basically. It's basically an exploit

80
00:05:31,820 --> 00:05:32,820
more than anything else

81
00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:36,940
yeah it's retarded so that I have to say but other than that

82
00:05:36,940 --> 00:05:39,660
I'm playing people that don't snake it's still really fun because the games get

83
00:05:39,660 --> 00:05:41,500
really close we played a match earlier today

84
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:45,940
and man down one race and down the line is just crazy

85
00:05:45,940 --> 00:05:48,580
Yeah, me, you, and Miklotov were all playing a match in the house, right?

86
00:05:48,580 --> 00:05:49,700
Yes, and that was fun.

87
00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:50,380
Good times.

88
00:05:50,380 --> 00:05:53,060
So I really wish there'd be more people on my friends list

89
00:05:53,060 --> 00:05:56,040
popping on during the day, but a lot of times, even doing worldwide,

90
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:58,780
it's hard to get four players, which is really strange.

91
00:05:58,780 --> 00:06:03,060
I don't know why I'm right into that problem, but I don't know.

92
00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:04,140
So I've been playing that.

93
00:06:04,140 --> 00:06:06,940
I've been playing Grand Theft Auto multiplayer.

94
00:06:06,940 --> 00:06:09,860
I am still owning everybody.

95
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:12,980
I'm on a five win winning streak right now,

96
00:06:12,980 --> 00:06:16,900
and basically kicking the crap out of all my co-workers it's great

97
00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:20,380
they uh... know that i'm coming to give them the beat down with uh... chainsaw

98
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:24,900
usually and uh... i'm uh... rocket sniper as well so it's really fun

99
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:27,700
i wish that game were online cuz that'd be really cool

100
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:31,340
and then i've been playing shadow of colossus still and i'm bored with that game

101
00:06:31,340 --> 00:06:34,940
i'm ready to be done with it i don't think it's a big huge impressive game

102
00:06:34,940 --> 00:06:36,020
that everyone was saying is

103
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:38,220
it looks pretty yeah

104
00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:41,220
that's about it there's really no content of the game i gotta be honest i

105
00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:44,040
So I was kind of excited about this game because I heard a lot of good stuff on our forums

106
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:46,960
and stuff and then you brought the game over for me to check out and you kind of showed

107
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:50,460
me the game and you were playing it a little bit and I was kind of, it was very pretty

108
00:06:50,460 --> 00:06:53,320
don't get me wrong, the game was very pretty looking and it looked like something I might

109
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:57,880
want to check out sometime but it just looked a little boring.

110
00:06:57,880 --> 00:06:59,840
I'm not sure I like the concept itself.

111
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:00,840
It looked a little...

112
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:01,840
It is boring.

113
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:02,840
There's no story to it really.

114
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:05,880
Maybe it's just my perspective and what I look for in a game but it didn't look like

115
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:08,320
my kind of thing.

116
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:11,500
I don't like the fact that there's no other enemies, no nothing,

117
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:14,980
there's no real puzzle. I mean, the only puzzle solving in the game is

118
00:07:14,980 --> 00:07:18,480
figuring out how to get on these colossus and figuring out how to kill them.

119
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:22,100
But once you're done with that, you're done. And there's only 16 of them in the game.

120
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:25,900
Granted, there is a hard mode, but when you go through the hard mode and the time modes or

121
00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:26,320
whatever,

122
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:30,900
you can actually unlock more weapons to make it easier. Why do you want the game to be

123
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:34,460
easier? It's gonna be shorter. Then they have some point where you can actually kill

124
00:07:34,460 --> 00:07:35,340
lizards and

125
00:07:35,340 --> 00:07:39,160
shoot fruit with like a bow and arrow and stuff but

126
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:43,460
that doesn't really do anything it's just whoopity-doo here it is

127
00:07:43,460 --> 00:07:46,680
so I don't really know I've kinda lost

128
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:51,000
purpose in the game. It's fun exploring stuff but there's no benefit to

129
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:51,560
doing it

130
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:54,840
like one of the things that people are talking about you can do is climbing

131
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:59,140
to the top of the temple thing. I haven't tried doing that but that looks

132
00:07:59,140 --> 00:08:01,000
like it could be fun because there's a lot of

133
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,600
area to roam around in but there's no enemy so what's it matter

134
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:08,760
you know it's it's really bad but I don't know

135
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:12,760
yet you play it anyway well I just want to get done with it so I can sell it back

136
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:16,320
oh I see well you're letting me borrow it for a little while right so I can check it out

137
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:17,100
for a little bit yeah

138
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:20,760
alright sounds good um but anything else that you've been playing

139
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:25,280
um I want to play some of the Warriors I haven't got a chance to play any more that

140
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:27,760
lately but that game I think is going to keep my interest more than anything

141
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:31,240
some games I've been playing this week I checked out

142
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:34,320
the Final Fantasy 12 demo and I gotta say I'm pretty impressed

143
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:38,460
It's, they did change some stuff from what I saw at E3 two years ago in regards to the

144
00:08:38,460 --> 00:08:43,580
battle system because it looks like now with the battle system that you, there's not the

145
00:08:43,580 --> 00:08:47,780
boxes around the screen or anything, it is very seamless where you are walking around

146
00:08:47,780 --> 00:08:52,100
and you, it's unlike other Final Fantasy games in the past, except for XI of course, where

147
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:55,500
you, I know a lot of people didn't play that, where you walk up to something and engage

148
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:58,960
it like in real time and it's very different from Final Fantasies of the past.

149
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:01,440
But I think what's very interesting about the battle system, which is pretty much all

150
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:05,680
that this demo really allows you to see is the battle system is that you

151
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:11,840
basically it kind of fuses 11 with the old battle systems which I think is very

152
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:15,800
interesting because there's a lot about 11 I really did like and the thing is is

153
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:20,960
that your your party members if you want them to will do their own things and

154
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:24,760
it's almost like you're playing online with but with intelligent people that

155
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:27,340
are you know doing the cures as they need to and all this other stuff so it's

156
00:09:27,340 --> 00:09:31,540
very different feel to the Final Fantasy game I noticed. I was a little

157
00:09:31,540 --> 00:09:34,820
disappointed with the summon sequences even though you know they're grand and

158
00:09:34,820 --> 00:09:38,180
overdone like they are in every Final Fantasy game. I was expecting something a

159
00:09:38,180 --> 00:09:41,180
little bit different, a little bit of load time problems there, but nothing

160
00:09:41,180 --> 00:09:48,020
nothing game crippling, just a slight kind of, oh that's too bad. But

161
00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:50,460
otherwise the demo kicked ass. I'm definitely looking forward to the game, I

162
00:09:50,460 --> 00:09:53,980
really want to check it out. My only other minor bitch is that the movie

163
00:09:53,980 --> 00:09:59,620
scenes in the demo were not rendered in the game and look like they are a copy of a movie

164
00:09:59,620 --> 00:10:06,420
because they are pixelated and I can see the pixelation really bad on my TV. I'm sorry.

165
00:10:06,420 --> 00:10:11,340
I'm having microphone problems tonight, sorry guys. It would look very pixelated on my TV

166
00:10:11,340 --> 00:10:14,800
and if that's the way that the game actually looks when it comes out I'm going to be sorely

167
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:19,460
disappointed. I'm sure this is just because it's the demo. I'm very sure it's just the

168
00:10:19,460 --> 00:10:23,560
demo and the movies will look fantastic but I couldn't help but kind of sense a little

169
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:30,840
of disappointment because I wanted to see in the demo a little bit that you know nice looking game

170
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:36,360
you know the rendering sequences and everything so uh also obviously if I got the final fantasy

171
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:40,520
12 demo I must be playing dragon quest 8 which is true I picked up a copy of dragon quest 8

172
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:45,400
there's a lot of stuff I really like about dragon quest 8 um it's I'm gonna be honest with you guys

173
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:50,520
I haven't really been into a dragon warrior or dragon quest game since the very very first game

174
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:54,600
on the NES I've kind of just slept through the rest of the series I never

175
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:57,320
played the one that was out on PlayStation I didn't bother to play well

176
00:10:57,320 --> 00:11:00,040
of course a lot of them didn't even come out here I didn't bother to play any of

177
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:03,840
the other ones on the NES so I kind of dragon quest but I'm for some reason

178
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:08,800
finding myself really liking this one it's definitely an old style RPG which

179
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:12,360
is good and you know maybe not good for some people but good for me because it's

180
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:15,380
definitely a throwback to like the older games where it's like you know the

181
00:11:15,380 --> 00:11:21,520
enemies are there, attack, magic, it's very basic. They don't try to overdo it with all

182
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:27,740
these crazy concepts or anything during the battle. So I like it. It's a good game. A

183
00:11:27,740 --> 00:11:32,600
lot of good graphics to it. It's got a very different graphical style to it, obviously

184
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:38,500
because some of the graphics were done by, you know, famous anime guy. The only disappointment

185
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:42,460
I would say that I have with the game is the cut sequences. There's some cut sequences

186
00:11:42,460 --> 00:11:47,620
in there that are kind of have a lot of low time and the voice acting is very slow and

187
00:11:47,620 --> 00:11:53,540
I find myself wanting to push the X button before the cut sequence finishes usually just

188
00:11:53,540 --> 00:11:57,460
to get through the cut sequences there I usually want to push the X button just to get through

189
00:11:57,460 --> 00:12:01,500
them so I apologize again you guys but I have a crazy mic tonight I might have to pass it

190
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:06,100
back and forth with somebody else here so the record it's a todiana who did Dragon Ball

191
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:11,780
Z thank you I yeah I knew he did Dragon Ball Z Dr. Slump and that's the only thing turns

192
00:12:11,780 --> 00:12:15,740
me off by that game I don't like Dragon Ball Z at all but you know a lot of the

193
00:12:15,740 --> 00:12:18,980
character animations are very funny like a lot of the animal a lot of the animals

194
00:12:18,980 --> 00:12:24,080
the monsters are very similar to what you saw in the old Dragon Warrior games

195
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:26,900
you know the slimes and everything but they do some funny things like they'll

196
00:12:26,900 --> 00:12:30,220
make your characters dance and the dancing motions are hilarious I love it

197
00:12:30,220 --> 00:12:35,860
it's great so yeah I definitely I recommend Dragon Quest 8 if you're a fan

198
00:12:35,860 --> 00:12:39,300
of role-playing games especially if you're looking for like a throwback to a

199
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:44,680
very old, less complicated RPG type game. A lot of work though. It's not something you

200
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:48,760
can just play through very quickly and watch the cutscenes. You will die if you don't take

201
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:52,160
some time to stop and gain experience. And that bugs some people, so I don't know.

202
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:55,680
Granted though, if you are still looking for a throwback to, you know, really old games

203
00:12:55,680 --> 00:13:01,280
and stuff, especially old RPGs, Wild Arms, Alter Code F, which came out a couple weeks

204
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:05,220
ago, and Romancing Saga, which came out a couple months ago, which was the original

205
00:13:05,220 --> 00:13:11,340
Soccer Frontier, so both remakes of their original counterparts should be pretty good

206
00:13:11,340 --> 00:13:12,340
too.

207
00:13:12,340 --> 00:13:17,500
And, oh, and, and, and in a couple weeks, Final Fantasy IV.

208
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:19,900
What's the street date on that, do we know?

209
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:25,180
Second week, or no, first, wait yeah, second week, second real week in December, so around

210
00:13:25,180 --> 00:13:27,620
the week of the 12th I think.

211
00:13:27,620 --> 00:13:29,260
I'm definitely looking forward to that.

212
00:13:29,260 --> 00:13:32,780
You spoonie bard.

213
00:13:32,780 --> 00:13:36,580
I think we'll start off getting into the news tonight, however, I want to issue a couple

214
00:13:36,580 --> 00:13:41,420
of corrections to things we've talked about on previous podcasts, because, you know, we're

215
00:13:41,420 --> 00:13:44,820
human, we're gaming fans, and we sometimes make mistakes.

216
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:47,740
This first one isn't so much a mistake as it is a clarification.

217
00:13:47,740 --> 00:13:52,380
A couple of podcasts ago we were talking about Guild Wars, and I said that NCSoft makes Guild

218
00:13:52,380 --> 00:13:56,440
Wars, and somebody over on our forums, a main fan over on the forums, wanted to clarify

219
00:13:56,440 --> 00:14:01,020
that ArenaNet actually made Guild Wars, and they deserve the credit.

220
00:14:01,020 --> 00:14:03,940
NCSoft simply publishes the game.

221
00:14:03,940 --> 00:14:05,700
Which is interesting because it kind of brings up

222
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:07,400
this whole thing about, you know,

223
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:09,440
usually it is the publishers that get the credit

224
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:10,540
because they're the ones that are, you know,

225
00:14:10,540 --> 00:14:11,980
paying for the advertising and all that stuff

226
00:14:11,980 --> 00:14:14,860
that are, you know, really getting the game out there.

227
00:14:14,860 --> 00:14:15,800
True.

228
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:19,380
So, you know, but I see definitely the point here

229
00:14:19,380 --> 00:14:21,100
that's trying to be made is that, you know what,

230
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:23,180
we need to give credit to the programmers as well.

231
00:14:23,180 --> 00:14:25,060
So, you know, a lot of times,

232
00:14:25,060 --> 00:14:28,120
and this is probably true of any gaming source

233
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:29,780
you're looking out there at,

234
00:14:29,780 --> 00:14:33,220
a lot of times the credit is going to the publisher and not necessarily the

235
00:14:33,220 --> 00:14:35,180
company who actually made the game so

236
00:14:35,180 --> 00:14:38,220
I'm definitely willing to issue that clarification there

237
00:14:38,220 --> 00:14:39,980
but just be careful with

238
00:14:39,980 --> 00:14:42,580
what you read out there because sometimes the people who are publishing

239
00:14:42,580 --> 00:14:44,420
the game may not necessarily be making it

240
00:14:44,420 --> 00:14:46,680
a classic example would be Nintendo

241
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:51,040
publishes a lot of stuff that they don't necessarily do like the old Rare games

242
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:53,940
you know

243
00:14:53,940 --> 00:14:57,020
something to think about. The other clarification we would like to make was related to

244
00:14:57,020 --> 00:14:59,580
something that we talked about previously last week

245
00:14:59,580 --> 00:15:03,580
and it had to do with the Chinese gamer and the parents were suing Blizzard.

246
00:15:03,580 --> 00:15:08,020
He was not a World of Warcraft player because World of Warcraft wasn't really

247
00:15:08,020 --> 00:15:12,500
out in China until May of this year. It was actually Warcraft 3

248
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:17,140
was the game that the Chinese gamer committed suicide after playing

249
00:15:17,140 --> 00:15:21,500
and the parents are still suing Blizzard because of it. But of course

250
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:24,820
this just goes to show, because we get our news from other

251
00:15:24,820 --> 00:15:25,980
sources obviously,

252
00:15:25,980 --> 00:15:28,920
Because there's very few companies that send us releases directly

253
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:33,160
But it just goes to show that the media will pick it up and run with it

254
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:37,920
You know about these horrible MMO RPGs that are you know, ruining people's lives and everything

255
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:42,000
So besides it wouldn't be the first time that Chinese person has killed themself over an MMO. So

256
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:44,680
Or kill their baby. It's still sad

257
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:50,100
It's sad depending on the age of whoever the gamer was it's their parent's responsibility to keep an eye on them

258
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:54,660
And you know, it's really stupid though because like in World of Warcraft you still

259
00:15:54,660 --> 00:16:01,100
Well, I guess it's the same in Warcraft 3. You jump off something you do end up dying if it's high enough

260
00:16:01,940 --> 00:16:04,740
Although the first thing I did was jump off the top of the tree

261
00:16:05,220 --> 00:16:10,740
You know, I have killed myself that way I jumped off a waterfall and I killed myself in World of Warcraft. So it is possible

262
00:16:11,940 --> 00:16:13,940
It's just stupidity

263
00:16:14,220 --> 00:16:15,980
Taking the bad genes out of the gene pool

264
00:16:15,980 --> 00:16:20,520
Well, let's start off with a our first story tonight and I said for tonight's first story

265
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:26,200
I want to do anything besides an Xbox 360 story just because I'm too oversaturated and believe me

266
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:30,380
We have plenty of Xbox 360 things to talk about I said anything but an Xbox 360 story

267
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:34,920
So we have something better. We have a story about 50 cent

268
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:37,720
He's retarded

269
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:41,840
50 cent actually has this game 50 cent bulletproof which came out recently and

270
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:43,560
sexual

271
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:48,560
Themes intense violence use of drugs blood and gore no surprise. This game has an M rating, right?

272
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:53,120
Well, guess what Curtis Jackson, also known as 50 Cent, said in a recent

273
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:57,920
interview with Reuters? Just because it is rated mature doesn't mean you

274
00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:02,200
shouldn't buy it for your kids. No, actually that's what it means. Hold on,

275
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:05,240
hold on though now, wait a minute, because I think this is where most people stopped

276
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:10,120
reading and here's what the rest of what 50 Cent has to say.

277
00:17:10,120 --> 00:17:17,120
He said, play the game and explain to them what they are playing. So he's saying

278
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:19,820
that parents should play the game and then explain to the kids what they are

279
00:17:19,820 --> 00:17:25,640
playing so I think the intentions might be good here I I know I wouldn't let my

280
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:29,300
kid play this type of game because that's just too much violence and sex

281
00:17:29,300 --> 00:17:33,740
and all that stuff but I do like the fact I think many people pass this off

282
00:17:33,740 --> 00:17:39,020
as 50 cent is crazy but I do like the fact that he is saying parents play the

283
00:17:39,020 --> 00:17:43,940
game with your child parents get involved even though maybe he didn't say

284
00:17:43,940 --> 00:17:47,780
at the right way I at least kind of give him a little bit of credit for trying to

285
00:17:47,780 --> 00:17:51,100
say that the parents should be involved although maybe he wasn't I don't know

286
00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:55,600
but what do you think I think what he's saying is oh my god my game was

287
00:17:55,600 --> 00:18:00,220
released one week after true crime New York City it's not gonna sell very well

288
00:18:00,220 --> 00:18:06,780
kids please buy my game because I need the money he's just not thinking that's

289
00:18:06,780 --> 00:18:12,340
all it is he's I thought he was like you can use this as a teaching tool and you

290
00:18:12,340 --> 00:18:22,500
You know, maybe it could be a teaching tool of sorts, but in the real world, kids are

291
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:28,460
just going to go, oh, 50 Cent said I should play this violent game, blah, blah, blah,

292
00:18:28,460 --> 00:18:29,460
blah, blah.

293
00:18:29,460 --> 00:18:30,460
Whatever.

294
00:18:30,460 --> 00:18:35,540
I, I wouldn't be surprised if they'd taken him completely out of context in this interview,

295
00:18:35,540 --> 00:18:37,060
because you know that stuff happens all the time.

296
00:18:37,060 --> 00:18:40,060
Loki, you wouldn't know anything about being taken out of context in an interview.

297
00:18:40,060 --> 00:18:42,540
Isn't it so much fun?

298
00:18:42,540 --> 00:18:45,540
Shhh...

299
00:18:45,540 --> 00:18:48,180
Alright, uh...

300
00:18:48,180 --> 00:18:51,180
I guess now we can talk a little bit about Xbox 360.

301
00:18:51,180 --> 00:18:55,700
Let's talk about this. I don't know if you knew this, but Microsoft is

302
00:18:55,700 --> 00:18:58,680
taking a hundred twenty six dollars.

303
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:02,020
They're writing it off for every Xbox 360 system they sell.

304
00:19:02,020 --> 00:19:05,780
And while this may sound shocking, it actually isn't that uncommon because the

305
00:19:05,780 --> 00:19:08,780
gaming companies really make their money back on the games.

306
00:19:08,780 --> 00:19:11,060
So just so you know, if you wanted to know

307
00:19:11,060 --> 00:19:13,460
how much of a loss Microsoft's taken on these consoles,

308
00:19:13,460 --> 00:19:15,620
$126, and that doesn't count, you know,

309
00:19:15,620 --> 00:19:16,820
when you throw in all these peripherals.

310
00:19:16,820 --> 00:19:20,100
This is just the console itself, so kinda interesting.

311
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:23,740
Microsoft also saying that they are aware of the shortages

312
00:19:23,740 --> 00:19:26,900
and they are pushing to, and this is a quote

313
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:29,260
from Peter Moore, the corporate vice president

314
00:19:29,260 --> 00:19:32,800
of worldwide marketing and publishing, said,

315
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:35,300
our goal is to replenish inventory

316
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:36,920
in the channel every week.

317
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:40,280
So lots of Xbox 360s are flowing in every single week.

318
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:42,160
It's not like we're shipping and then going dry

319
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:43,760
for two or three weeks.

320
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:45,320
Loki, you have anything to add to this mess?

321
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:49,840
Yeah, basically, he's quoted saying,

322
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:51,160
and I just saw this earlier,

323
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:52,280
because they basically,

324
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:55,680
they're not gonna be short at all

325
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:56,720
with what's coming out here.

326
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:57,720
Man, I wish I had the article.

327
00:19:57,720 --> 00:19:58,560
Oh, here we go.

328
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:02,120
Basically, Major Nelson,

329
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:05,920
the guy who's behind a lot of this launch stuff,

330
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:15,480
He was visiting his family here on the East Coast and he says he took the opportunity

331
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:20,020
over the past couple of days to stop at various retailers in southern New England to check

332
00:20:20,020 --> 00:20:22,660
out what people are saying about the Xbox 360.

333
00:20:22,660 --> 00:20:26,820
One thing I noticed was that there was a large amount of incorrect information floating around

334
00:20:26,820 --> 00:20:28,620
regarding shipments of units.

335
00:20:28,620 --> 00:20:33,500
One store incorrectly told me that Microsoft won't send us anymore until March.

336
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:39,740
I double checked with the retail team and while I can't speak to each retail outlet's

337
00:20:39,740 --> 00:20:46,420
specific distribution strategy, I can tell you that we have a weekly replenishment strategy.

338
00:20:46,420 --> 00:20:51,360
That means that we have new shipments of Xbox 360s being sent out each week.

339
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:55,500
If you hear that a store won't be getting an Xbox 360 from Microsoft until next year,

340
00:20:55,500 --> 00:21:02,260
you may want to gently remind them that your source, in fact, that we are shipping consoles

341
00:21:02,260 --> 00:21:03,260
each week.

342
00:21:03,260 --> 00:21:07,100
story is be patient once again don't believe all the rumors you hear so

343
00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:13,940
that's that's a good point from the horse's mouth I let you know these Xbox

344
00:21:13,940 --> 00:21:17,180
360s have been reporting crashing in dark soccer you saw one of these things

345
00:21:17,180 --> 00:21:24,820
crash you know to be perfectly honest we got the BS OD once and then after that I

346
00:21:24,820 --> 00:21:28,580
actually just saw it freeze without anything just completely froze in the

347
00:21:28,580 --> 00:21:32,980
the middle of a race.

348
00:21:32,980 --> 00:21:35,460
Now, apparently you can actually fix these crashing

349
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:36,700
Xbox 360s.

350
00:21:36,700 --> 00:21:39,620
This was something that was posted over on GameSpot forums

351
00:21:39,620 --> 00:21:42,020
that you can actually fix it with string.

352
00:21:42,020 --> 00:21:45,900
All you have to do, hang it from above the ground.

353
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:48,000
Because the problem is that in these cabinets and stuff,

354
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,140
they're overheating.

355
00:21:49,140 --> 00:21:51,540
Because there's no way for it to effectively cool down.

356
00:21:51,540 --> 00:21:53,220
The power supply is overheating.

357
00:21:53,220 --> 00:21:54,700
I cleared that up.

358
00:21:54,700 --> 00:21:57,260
But the problem is the power supply is it does have a fan.

359
00:21:57,260 --> 00:22:01,260
And like any console, you want to keep it perfectly ventilated.

360
00:22:01,260 --> 00:22:03,260
This is also with a computer or anything.

361
00:22:03,260 --> 00:22:05,260
You just need proper ventilation around it.

362
00:22:05,260 --> 00:22:10,260
But they say place in either that or like suspending on a box lid or something like that,

363
00:22:10,260 --> 00:22:14,260
like a small box, just to basically give some airflow around it.

364
00:22:14,260 --> 00:22:16,260
So the power supplies are overheating.

365
00:22:16,260 --> 00:22:18,260
They have fans inside of them, but they're not that strong.

366
00:22:18,260 --> 00:22:23,260
Also, the fact the console unit itself, they said that there's ventilation holes

367
00:22:23,260 --> 00:22:25,260
that aren't getting punched out during manufacturing

368
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:29,420
and that could also lend to overheating as well.

369
00:22:29,420 --> 00:22:32,860
Um, actually they had a lot of the same

370
00:22:32,860 --> 00:22:36,460
issue. I remember when the Dreamcast was released saying that it was overheating.

371
00:22:36,460 --> 00:22:41,340
Um, well uh, what we used to do was we actually had a

372
00:22:41,340 --> 00:22:44,940
a box set out until we started using our PS2 as a Dreamcast stand

373
00:22:44,940 --> 00:22:49,700
and uh, letting it air out. Because all you have to do is keep those vents

374
00:22:49,700 --> 00:22:53,340
uh, free of any obstruction and it does just fine. You know what, some

375
00:22:53,340 --> 00:22:56,860
third-party company and it's gonna come out just like they did with the original PlayStation

376
00:22:56,860 --> 00:22:59,620
remember the fan that straps to the side of it and blows air through it

377
00:22:59,620 --> 00:23:03,020
so it doesn't overheat it. Maybe the same thing could

378
00:23:03,020 --> 00:23:07,000
you know set the power supply in something and it cools it off. Or maybe you could not release a

379
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,180
console that overheats

380
00:23:08,180 --> 00:23:13,060
how about that? Yeah that might be good. I tell you they're falling into the Dreamcast trap.

381
00:23:13,060 --> 00:23:18,260
Be very interesting to see. We wouldn't want a system to fail like the N-Gage

382
00:23:18,260 --> 00:23:22,620
and DarkSakura you have something about the N-Gage right? This made me smile

383
00:23:22,620 --> 00:23:27,100
Nokia shifts focus from gaming.

384
00:23:27,100 --> 00:23:30,300
And how long did this take them?

385
00:23:30,300 --> 00:23:33,540
Nokia's VP of Corporate Strategy,

386
00:23:33,540 --> 00:23:37,180
I guess I'm pronouncing this right, Antti Vasara, has

387
00:23:37,180 --> 00:23:41,380
confirmed that there are no plans for future versions of the N-Gage.

388
00:23:41,380 --> 00:23:44,660
They are turning their focus toward mobile TV

389
00:23:44,660 --> 00:23:48,780
and music with the introduction of handsets like the N91

390
00:23:48,780 --> 00:23:51,860
smartphone that can hold up to 3,000 music tracks.

391
00:23:51,860 --> 00:23:57,060
they're planning on placing a greater emphasis on mobile gaming in 2007

392
00:23:57,060 --> 00:24:00,940
which by that time screen sizes and quality were all for better games.

393
00:24:00,940 --> 00:24:04,780
And also the other thing is they're going to be introducing, they don't want

394
00:24:04,780 --> 00:24:08,140
just one platform dedicated to gaming, they're actually going to be incorporated

395
00:24:08,140 --> 00:24:09,940
into all their M60 phones

396
00:24:09,940 --> 00:24:14,340
which will be coming out so that's another reason why that they

397
00:24:14,340 --> 00:24:18,340
shouldn't be supporting the N-Gage. Well the quote I have from him is,

398
00:24:18,340 --> 00:24:22,660
Engage is still being sold, but it was not success in the sense of developing a new category

399
00:24:24,060 --> 00:24:26,060
Engage we bid thee farewell

400
00:24:30,380 --> 00:24:32,380
Wow, oh

401
00:24:32,540 --> 00:24:37,180
Darn, what a loss. Sorry. I I think we've been doing this for like 45 weeks now

402
00:24:37,180 --> 00:24:40,680
And I haven't yet to use the soundboard for anything. So I had to do that

403
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:48,680
I'm sorry, the N-Gage was crappy. I tried to like this system so bad. I tried to play it at E3.

404
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:50,680
You have an N-Gage?

405
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:52,680
And we gave it away.

406
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:53,680
It's bad.

407
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:55,680
It was the first model TacoPhone.

408
00:24:55,680 --> 00:25:02,680
Alright. Speaking of something that should be sent far, far away, something about Jack Thompson

409
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:06,680
and I don't like bringing this guy up every week, but you got something funny.

410
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:15,320
yeah actually one of our regular listeners Rob with two B's he's actually

411
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:20,600
sent me several articles and one of them I thought was about time Jack Thompson's

412
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:26,480
Alabama license was revoked he had been basically shipped out before you know

413
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:31,200
while they reviewed it but his license is actually gone he cannot practice law

414
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:36,120
in the state of Alabama that just goes to show you boys and girls do not fuck

415
00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:44,140
with the gaming community yeah but he don't sue me of course he fired back at

416
00:25:44,140 --> 00:25:49,120
a judge more by claiming that the judge had violated the Alabama canons of

417
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:54,280
judicial ethics by his unfortunate improper and prejudicial prejudiced I'm

418
00:25:54,280 --> 00:25:59,480
sorry prejudicial acts in this case at the expense of three bereaved Alabama

419
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:04,500
families oh let me guess he's an activist judge you know what I think is

420
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:08,920
because there's somebody with some common sense in my home state, excuse me, who thought

421
00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:11,520
that you were a big loser. How about that?

422
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:17,700
Too many practices, mainly out of Florida. Oh, who cares. Sorry to any of our listeners

423
00:26:17,700 --> 00:26:18,700
in Florida.

424
00:26:18,700 --> 00:26:23,860
Moving on, Loki, what else do you have for us?

425
00:26:23,860 --> 00:26:29,860
Well, other than overheating Xboxes, we're hearing reports of scratching disks in the

426
00:26:29,860 --> 00:26:35,420
Xbox as well. Some people are saying, don't play your Xbox vertical. Some are saying don't

427
00:26:35,420 --> 00:26:40,700
play it horizontal. Some people are just saying don't play it at all. But basically, no matter

428
00:26:40,700 --> 00:26:45,540
what you do, your disc will get scratched. Basically the moral of the story is don't

429
00:26:45,540 --> 00:26:50,080
tip your Xbox over while you're playing it. It goes to show you that it really rushes

430
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:54,340
the market if they haven't found out, oh, these detrimental things. Hey, this is scratching

431
00:26:54,340 --> 00:26:59,820
discs. Maybe that's not a good feature they put in there. So that was kind of interesting

432
00:26:59,820 --> 00:27:05,980
The other one that I thought was kind of funny is they were talking about the Xbox 360 DVD

433
00:27:05,980 --> 00:27:06,980
player.

434
00:27:06,980 --> 00:27:13,160
They're saying it's not very good, actually, and funny, neither was the Xbox's DVD player.

435
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:15,060
No progressive scan, excuse me?

436
00:27:15,060 --> 00:27:16,060
It says on...

437
00:27:16,060 --> 00:27:17,820
Not nearly as awful as the PS2.

438
00:27:17,820 --> 00:27:24,360
They're testing it on episode 3 and said it looked this decent, but this person who was

439
00:27:24,360 --> 00:27:28,180
reviewing it, their Samsung progressive player blew it out of the water.

440
00:27:28,180 --> 00:27:30,180
No, it sounds like no progressive on this one either.

441
00:27:31,180 --> 00:27:35,180
You've got to be kidding me. No, I swear I read an article that said they had it.

442
00:27:36,180 --> 00:27:39,180
I'm sure some listener is going to email us one way or the other.

443
00:27:40,180 --> 00:27:44,180
You know what, you shouldn't be using your video game system as a DVD player anyway.

444
00:27:45,180 --> 00:27:46,180
Well, some of us are cheap.

445
00:27:47,180 --> 00:27:54,180
You know what, you can go to Sam's Club and pay $50 and get a DVD player that will do everything you need it to do.

446
00:27:54,180 --> 00:28:00,300
you need it to do. And finally, with every video game system launch, there's always going

447
00:28:00,300 --> 00:28:07,300
to be a campaign to put Linux on it. That's right! Free60, the Free60 project, is aiming

448
00:28:09,380 --> 00:28:16,380
to put Linux, such as Darwin, on the Xbox 360 and they've gathered lots of useful, detailed

449
00:28:17,700 --> 00:28:22,660
information surrounding inner workings of the 360. For example, apparently the Xbox

450
00:28:22,660 --> 00:28:29,300
360 is secured down by the following a flash that's encrypted with a per box key and then

451
00:28:29,300 --> 00:28:33,660
they have this key stored inside the CPU and yada yada yada basically they're figuring

452
00:28:33,660 --> 00:28:38,760
out how this thing works i've said from the start putting a game on the hard drive with

453
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:43,020
the 360 is a dumb idea because you're just gonna be able to reverse engineer that and

454
00:28:43,020 --> 00:28:49,940
voila homebrew so um you know although i've kind of made fun of the people that install

455
00:28:49,940 --> 00:28:54,900
Linux on systems in the past. Honestly, I do get the point of this when it comes to

456
00:28:54,900 --> 00:28:59,380
the Xbox 360, because it does open the door to all this neat homebrew stuff. It's when

457
00:28:59,380 --> 00:29:03,300
you try to install Linux on like a toaster and a Billy Bass that I kind of go, what?

458
00:29:03,300 --> 00:29:06,460
Hey, it's been done! Or a Speak and Spell, I know it's been done.

459
00:29:06,460 --> 00:29:11,540
It's like, you know, come on. What is the practical, I mean, what are you going to run

460
00:29:11,540 --> 00:29:19,500
on a Billy Bass? No, somebody just did that because they could. Anyway. Anyways. Dark

461
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:21,500
Sucker you have a story for us about Harry Potter

462
00:29:22,220 --> 00:29:28,980
Yes, cuz I actually just saw the movie this week. I so happy I decided to see rent instead actually

463
00:29:28,980 --> 00:29:34,100
And I do want to see Harry Potter, but I I want it. I'm thinking of that song. I want America

464
00:29:34,100 --> 00:29:36,100
I want the kids to be good

465
00:29:36,740 --> 00:29:39,780
You know and I couldn't help but think about that the whole time. I was watching though

466
00:29:39,780 --> 00:29:43,100
I I'm gonna get hate mail over this I hated red. I thought it was awful

467
00:29:43,100 --> 00:29:46,500
I just I was the whole time I was sitting there going get a job get a job

468
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:48,980
I still want to see it or get AIDS

469
00:29:50,580 --> 00:29:54,800
Moving on this supposed to be a retailing. What was the blah blah him? Yeah

470
00:29:55,940 --> 00:29:59,260
Yeah, but then they never mind. I don't okay back to game

471
00:30:00,580 --> 00:30:02,580
How do you put that?

472
00:30:03,740 --> 00:30:11,060
Electronic arts released a one-level demo for the movie tie-in for Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire and it's available for download

473
00:30:12,140 --> 00:30:13,860
I

474
00:30:13,860 --> 00:30:18,700
Actually, I'm not sure if it's on EA site. I know that they have a link to it from a Eurogamer

475
00:30:20,260 --> 00:30:25,300
So I would suggest go there click on the article about the Harry Potter demo and give it a download because it's supposed to be

476
00:30:25,300 --> 00:30:27,180
pretty cool I

477
00:30:27,180 --> 00:30:29,180
saw it for like

478
00:30:29,220 --> 00:30:32,300
Half a minute at e3 and I was like that looks kind of neat

479
00:30:32,300 --> 00:30:35,940
I did I did play like Harry Potter DS for like two seconds

480
00:30:35,940 --> 00:30:40,980
And I just knew that you I did the little spell thing with the stylus and I thought that was kind of funny

481
00:30:41,060 --> 00:30:43,060
So, I don't know. I

482
00:30:43,060 --> 00:30:48,020
I don't buy a lot of the movie tie-ins unless it's really good, like Street Fighter II,

483
00:30:48,020 --> 00:30:49,240
the movie, the game.

484
00:30:49,240 --> 00:30:50,240
Just kidding.

485
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:51,240
That sucked.

486
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:52,240
I have that on my maim.

487
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:53,240
It's bad.

488
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:57,120
You know, I think I have that somewhere in a box for Saturn.

489
00:30:57,120 --> 00:30:58,120
I'm sorry.

490
00:30:58,120 --> 00:30:59,120
It's awful.

491
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:02,640
I think we bought it because it was a dollar.

492
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:08,280
Let's go over to ye olde mailbag, and I'm sure we've got plenty of emails.

493
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:09,680
Dark Soccer's gotta catch us up tonight.

494
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:14,680
If you want to send us an email to go at OrangeLoungeRadio.com is a place to send an email.

495
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:18,680
The Lovely Dark Soccer will read your email and make fun of your grammar.

496
00:31:18,680 --> 00:31:20,680
Well, I do that anyway.

497
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:21,680
I do that for free.

498
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:23,680
What do we got?

499
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:29,680
Well, just a couple more articles sent to us by our friend Rob, who is not you.

500
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:31,680
One about the PS3 pricing.

501
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:33,680
I actually read through this article.

502
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:36,680
It's a bit long to cover for the podcast.

503
00:31:36,680 --> 00:31:43,200
I briefly read the article and it was on a CNN money actually and I think they

504
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:47,320
retracted the statement too. I think I heard about that they retracted that a little later so

505
00:31:47,320 --> 00:31:52,360
don't believe anything you hear until like E3. This is fairly recent but they were

506
00:31:52,360 --> 00:31:57,280
talking about with the DVD formats the different high-definition formats being

507
00:31:57,280 --> 00:32:03,160
supported by Sony and Microsoft bringing back sort of like the old Betamax VHS

508
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:11,720
war goody-goody beta max was better by the way stupid VHS we actually did sort

509
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:15,440
of have a conversation via email I'm thinking that the price of the Xbox is

510
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:19,800
definitely gonna drop after the release of the ps3 oh it has to 60 it has to

511
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:30,880
yeah it's only the next office gonna make any money on it also he sent a wrap

512
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:37,860
I lost the email I apologize um I actually did also get a notice from him

513
00:32:37,860 --> 00:32:43,720
about skeeball licensed for the mobile phone like skeeball like throwing the

514
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:46,720
ball and landing it in the Rings yeah why would you play this on your mobile

515
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:49,400
phone why would you play bejeweled on your mobile why why would you play

516
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:55,280
bowling on your mobile phone or golf I guess whatever okay now this one had me

517
00:32:55,280 --> 00:32:58,920
all excited Sega launches new operations arm

518
00:32:58,920 --> 00:33:03,900
Sega is back in the amusement game operations business and they plan to grow that part of

519
00:33:03,900 --> 00:33:08,900
their empire by building on the purchase of Gameworks, which has now re-emerged from bankruptcy

520
00:33:08,900 --> 00:33:09,900
protection.

521
00:33:09,900 --> 00:33:14,000
I'm very glad to hear someone still gives a shit about the arcades, honestly, this is

522
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,000
great news.

523
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:19,960
Well Sega has always kicked ass in the arcades, and to touch on the skee-ball thing, the only

524
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:25,760
reason why that game sucks is because your phone doesn't spit out tickets.

525
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:30,380
There's a quote in here saying the asset purchase of Gameworks, a premier location-based entertainment

526
00:33:30,380 --> 00:33:34,620
destination, provides a platform for Sega to lead the amusement and facilities market

527
00:33:34,620 --> 00:33:35,620
domestically.

528
00:33:35,620 --> 00:33:40,380
They're actually focusing on the U.S. market.

529
00:33:40,380 --> 00:33:44,040
Another quote in here, blending Japanese culture with American creativity has resulted in some

530
00:33:44,040 --> 00:33:47,940
of the most compelling, innovative, and popular products in the world.

531
00:33:47,940 --> 00:33:53,580
SEUI also has the added advantage of tapping Sega's manufacturing expertise, all to deliver

532
00:33:53,580 --> 00:33:59,980
consumers an unparalleled entertainment experience what else we got also got

533
00:33:59,980 --> 00:34:05,900
more email from actually one of our fellow podcasters all right be black

534
00:34:05,900 --> 00:34:12,460
wolf oh that guy he's got a good show I just talking about uh I have to find

535
00:34:12,460 --> 00:34:17,820
email and we don't do it for a couple ways to get disorganized it's actually

536
00:34:17,820 --> 00:34:20,860
is mentioning I think I mentioned it on their three-hour show about him

537
00:34:20,860 --> 00:34:25,860
listening to our podcast while playing on the Xbox 360 I thought that's pretty

538
00:34:25,860 --> 00:34:31,320
cool. Oh right on. But yeah you can get your iPod to work through the Xbox 360

539
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:36,040
while you're playing any game. That was pretty cool. Very cool thank you. Yes you

540
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:39,760
can actually if a game has you know a crap soundtrack you can listen to

541
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:46,620
whatever you want to. Awesome. I was gonna plug his website but I suddenly lost the

542
00:34:46,620 --> 00:34:50,260
URL but I know it's it's in our web links section on our website orange

543
00:34:50,260 --> 00:34:57,940
on his radio.com so check it out it's it's cool wait I got it I got the here

544
00:34:57,940 --> 00:35:03,300
it is it's a games.com thank you all games.com slash podcast how did you beat

545
00:35:03,300 --> 00:35:07,220
me to that is that email you suck all right I'll get so close my guess check

546
00:35:07,220 --> 00:35:11,300
it out he talks about a lot of the same stuff we do and not that it's the same

547
00:35:11,300 --> 00:35:14,220
thing it's just you know we have similar interests so that makes them cool the

548
00:35:14,220 --> 00:35:18,860
very last one I mentioned this before ragnaville sort of a portal for all free

549
00:35:18,860 --> 00:35:25,860
servers for Ragnarok online. The information is all up on the guy's site. Mark emailed

550
00:35:27,580 --> 00:35:32,580
me. So you'd want to go to www.ragnaville.com. Check it out.

551
00:35:32,580 --> 00:35:37,420
Huh. And gravity hasn't done anything about this?

552
00:35:37,420 --> 00:35:40,220
I haven't heard of gravity doing anything about it.

553
00:35:40,220 --> 00:35:43,540
Do they just not care anymore because they got Ragnarok 2 on the horizon? Which, by the

554
00:35:43,540 --> 00:35:47,060
way, you showed me that demo, or that, not the demo, the movie of Ragnarok 2. That looks

555
00:35:47,060 --> 00:35:48,140
pretty hot.

556
00:35:48,140 --> 00:35:52,140
That will get me totally off World of Warcraft when Ragnarok 2 comes out.

557
00:35:52,140 --> 00:35:56,140
I gotta say, Ragnarok 2 looked pretty hot. Gravity doesn't...

558
00:35:56,140 --> 00:36:00,140
Maybe they can't do anything because they're overseas. I don't know, that's kind of interesting.

559
00:36:00,140 --> 00:36:04,140
Well, the thing is that IRO was actually played out of

560
00:36:04,140 --> 00:36:08,140
California, actually. Weird. Because I

561
00:36:08,140 --> 00:36:12,140
decided to look up their Better Business Bureau stats for a while. Oh yeah, when

562
00:36:12,140 --> 00:36:16,140
all that crap was going down. Maybe that's why everybody went underground.

563
00:36:16,140 --> 00:36:19,780
I don't think that there's any you know upon further review

564
00:36:19,780 --> 00:36:24,220
I don't think there's any major problem with listing the free servers out there because it's technically not

565
00:36:25,260 --> 00:36:27,880
Hosting the servers. Okay. Yeah

566
00:36:27,980 --> 00:36:28,460
No

567
00:36:28,460 --> 00:36:32,980
Again, though that could get some of those servers in trouble if they use that if you know

568
00:36:32,980 --> 00:36:37,380
Whoever the legal ones in charge use that as their portal to find these people. I

569
00:36:38,740 --> 00:36:42,620
Understand the right draw community is a very tight one and a very rabid one and it's cool

570
00:36:42,620 --> 00:36:47,480
And you know, I I think it's kind of neat when especially when people are like trying to mod the game and do different things

571
00:36:47,480 --> 00:36:52,540
With it, but you know, just just be careful guys. Just make sure just make sure you're in all your checks and balances legally

572
00:36:52,540 --> 00:36:54,700
We don't want to see you get busted. Have fun. Have fun

573
00:36:54,700 --> 00:37:00,700
Make sure your copy doesn't have that pyrite virus and gravity a dollar, you know, they did write it send them a dollar at least

574
00:37:01,740 --> 00:37:03,740
Alright, so that's it for email

575
00:37:04,700 --> 00:37:08,780
to go at orange on radio commie if you want to send us some more we love getting email I

576
00:37:08,780 --> 00:37:15,740
I wanted to mention real quickly about Suikoden 5, they're gonna get a special

577
00:37:15,740 --> 00:37:20,460
edition Suikoden 5 in Japan. Of course they always get special editions in

578
00:37:20,460 --> 00:37:23,340
Japan don't they? This is Konami's kind of answer to the Final Fantasy series.

579
00:37:23,340 --> 00:37:27,820
Some people will say it's better, who knows? It's really a matter of opinion.

580
00:37:27,820 --> 00:37:32,700
It's gonna come with a 200 page book with character illustrations because of

581
00:37:32,700 --> 00:37:36,340
course the kind of niche of Suikoden is that you have like a hundred different

582
00:37:36,340 --> 00:37:42,900
Like what is 101 and some games 108 and others playable characters, but 108 it's 108 stars

583
00:37:42,900 --> 00:37:46,700
I forget that's like the big catch this week. Oh, they're also gonna have an arranged soundtrack

584
00:37:47,300 --> 00:37:54,860
Written musical scores art in the book and everything fold out cardboard art board. It's gonna be great

585
00:37:54,860 --> 00:37:56,860
So check that out so he couldn't

586
00:37:57,400 --> 00:37:59,400
Will they do the same thing in the u.s.

587
00:37:59,660 --> 00:38:03,760
Probably likely probably not but right Konami tell them you want it. You never know what might happen

588
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:05,760
Loki, you got anything else for us?

589
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:07,760
Yeah, I got a few thanks.

590
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:21,760
First off, I was going to mention that Australia is actually getting the Australian Game Developers Conference 2005, Developing Dreams.

591
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:28,760
The fifth edition of the Developers and Publishers Matchmaking Business Convention will take place on December 5th, 6th, and 7th.

592
00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:38,880
7th and we'll be back to some French and basically they're gonna have tons of

593
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:44,720
publisher sounds like kind of their version of e3 so to speak including all

594
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:52,360
the big names you know Nintendo's Sega and Sony etc oh good I'm glad they're

595
00:38:52,360 --> 00:38:55,320
getting a little love down there in Australia with all that so that's good I

596
00:38:55,320 --> 00:38:58,200
hope I hope some of our listeners down there get to go to that yeah should be

597
00:38:58,200 --> 00:39:04,400
pretty cool um let's see other things coming out of the woodwork of course um

598
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:11,880
looks like that a patent joystick found a patent for their virtual emulation for

599
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:14,800
these old systems and one of the thing that was kind of interesting for it as

600
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:20,120
that you select your character before you select your game which is that could

601
00:39:20,120 --> 00:39:23,120
be very interesting playing different characters in different games running

602
00:39:23,120 --> 00:39:27,800
around as Mario and Zelda or something who did this this is actually a patent

603
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:34,800
joystick found it on the US patent. Who owns the patent? Nintendo. Oh, Nintendo, ok. So

604
00:39:34,860 --> 00:39:41,020
this is supposedly what they're going to be using for the revolution, which is quite interesting.

605
00:39:41,020 --> 00:39:44,180
So you could play other characters in the game, well that would be nothing but a simple

606
00:39:44,180 --> 00:39:47,580
sprite mod for a lot of those old games, so that would be kind of interesting. Yeah, so

607
00:39:47,580 --> 00:39:54,580
it should be interesting. Let's see how that comes about. Also, it was announced that Sony

608
00:39:54,580 --> 00:40:01,580
going to be debuting the PS3 at Consumer Electronics Show 2006, which should be interesting.

609
00:40:02,580 --> 00:40:05,580
Maybe they'll debut when they're releasing the price as well.

610
00:40:05,580 --> 00:40:08,580
That would be nice. Some more specs on it would be nice to hear.

611
00:40:08,580 --> 00:40:09,580
Yeah, seriously.

612
00:40:09,580 --> 00:40:10,580
We'll see.

613
00:40:10,580 --> 00:40:14,580

00:41:14,340 --> 00:41:16,820

626
00:41:16,820 --> 00:41:22,640
coming out in about two weeks or so. Animal Crossing Wild World is going to be coming

627
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:28,000
out for the DS. You've got Super Mario Strikers for those people that like those Mario sports

628
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:34,600
games. Let's see what else. You've also got a bunch of PSP games actually. You've got

629
00:41:34,600 --> 00:41:40,860
WWE vs. Smackdown 06 coming out for the PSP. As well, of course, Dead or Alive 4 is coming

630
00:41:40,860 --> 00:41:47,040
out for the 360 which will be really good and then some more niche stuff

631
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:54,360
Tokobots coming out for the PSP as well as there's some other stuff oh of course

632
00:41:54,360 --> 00:41:58,560
the biggest game of the month would be gauntlet seven sorrows and that's pretty

633
00:41:58,560 --> 00:42:03,680
much it there's actually another game coming out on December 14th um darwinia

634
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:08,760
for down it will be available for download for 1995 is this u.s. or UK or

635
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:14,840
both actually it says $19.95 in dollars so it's American very cool they are

636
00:42:14,840 --> 00:42:18,320
actually saying though that soon after it's released there will be a

637
00:42:18,320 --> 00:42:22,600
multiplayer version on the way now what is that winning all about because I'm

638
00:42:22,600 --> 00:42:25,600
not very familiar with this one I didn't have too much time to look into it but I

639
00:42:25,600 --> 00:42:30,800
think it's more of a virtual universe one of our somebody brought this up one

640
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:34,880
of our listeners okay I remember this I remember this okay great cool

641
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:38,760
sounds good what's the website for that do we know I just closed that's right

642
00:42:38,760 --> 00:42:42,040
actually if you go to I think the company that makes it is called steam

643
00:42:42,040 --> 00:42:48,400
okay so if you I guess we're just google it I'm sure Darwinia uh Loki I noticed

644
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:51,320
you have this up on the screen right now this is kind of PSP related I'm really

645
00:42:51,320 --> 00:42:54,800
curious about this is this the Namco volume 2 collection Namco battle

646
00:42:54,800 --> 00:43:00,080
collection volume 2 on which has been announced as 11 original games and 12 or

647
00:43:00,080 --> 00:43:07,080
are two arranged games and basically the list of games we've got a king and balloon, boscania,

648
00:43:09,560 --> 00:43:16,560
bosconian, azevious, mappy, the tower of uraga. How many fucking times do we need to see mappy

649
00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:27,600
though seriously? Mappy's been in every Namco collection since the dawn of time. Mappy's

650
00:43:27,600 --> 00:43:32,180
cool and all, but seriously, I'm done with Mappy. There's one game I'm disappointed that's

651
00:43:32,180 --> 00:43:37,300
not in there. What's that? Legend of Valkyrie. Hmm, let's see, Grubda, looks like that's

652
00:43:37,300 --> 00:43:43,840
in there, Dragon Buster, we've got Dig Dug 2, Motos. Dig Dug 2, by the way, highly underrated.

653
00:43:43,840 --> 00:43:49,240
I actually like Dig Dug 2. I don't know why more people don't. Motos, Rolling Thunder,

654
00:43:49,240 --> 00:43:54,440
Dragon Spirit, and then for the ranged games, we have Pac-Man Arrangement Plus, with a giant

655
00:43:54,440 --> 00:43:59,000
plus sign there so looks like another version of Pac-man and modus arrangement which I've

656
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:00,000
never played before.

657
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:01,000
Why did they arrange modus?

658
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:02,000
I don't know.

659
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:05,120
Is there a modus fan club I'm unaware of?

660
00:44:05,120 --> 00:44:06,120
But anyways.

661
00:44:06,120 --> 00:44:07,120
Why did they arrange?

662
00:44:07,120 --> 00:44:08,520
Oh I guess they did arrange Digdy.

663
00:44:08,520 --> 00:44:14,300
It's slated for the Japanese market in February 23, 2006.

664
00:44:14,300 --> 00:44:22,520
It's actually going to be priced at only 3,990 yen and a lot cheaper than most of the original

665
00:44:22,520 --> 00:44:29,880
game, which was 5,040 yen, and the Japanese release is not yet scheduled, but probably

666
00:44:29,880 --> 00:44:30,880
will be soon after.

667
00:44:30,880 --> 00:44:31,880
And I'm sure we'll get it.

668
00:44:31,880 --> 00:44:33,540
Oh, I'm sure we will.

669
00:44:33,540 --> 00:44:37,640
But there might be different games in ours, because there was in the Japanese one, too.

670
00:44:37,640 --> 00:44:42,640
But they also got the little restricted symbol over in Japan, too, with bonus games on the

671
00:44:42,640 --> 00:44:47,740
old, they didn't have a five-disc set, they had a six-disc Namco set for the PlayStation

672
00:44:47,740 --> 00:44:54,580
But I didn't get to play Legend of the Valkyrie until I got the HuCard for the PC Engine.

673
00:44:54,580 --> 00:44:55,580
Wow.

674
00:44:55,580 --> 00:45:01,300
I want to do one quick story here on Guitar Hero.

675
00:45:01,300 --> 00:45:04,560
You know this game, Guitar Hero, it's a music game that's really turning some heads just

676
00:45:04,560 --> 00:45:08,580
because of its real powerhouse song list and just kind of really great control.

677
00:45:08,580 --> 00:45:13,740
And of course, I think most of us gave a favorable review on this game on the earlier podcast.

678
00:45:13,740 --> 00:45:17,740
It's pretty cool even if you're not really into music games.

679
00:45:17,740 --> 00:45:21,860
This is interesting because Guitar Hero is actually going to be featured on MTV, which

680
00:45:21,860 --> 00:45:26,000
shouldn't be too much of a surprise because you see the MTV logo when you boot up the

681
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:27,000
game.

682
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:31,800
However, they're going to really be whoring out Guitar Hero on MTV on the cable, including

683
00:45:31,800 --> 00:45:36,340
MTV, MTV2, the MTV University channel, and MTV.com.

684
00:45:36,340 --> 00:45:40,780
This is a partnership between MTV Games and Red Octane.

685
00:45:40,780 --> 00:45:45,500
the first time rock music is not in the background but instead it is the game

686
00:45:45,500 --> 00:45:49,800
quote there from a CEO red octane well you know who their other partnership is

687
00:45:49,800 --> 00:45:55,840
with right well harmonics Gibson guitars over that too yeah every I because if

688
00:45:55,840 --> 00:46:00,160
you actually look through your unlocks every guitar in that game is a Gibson

689
00:46:00,160 --> 00:46:06,520
guitar down to their classics speaking of MTV I find this very interesting they

690
00:46:06,520 --> 00:46:10,320
are really pushing to get more game-oriented content recently not only

691
00:46:10,320 --> 00:46:15,320
did they pick this up but they they bought game trailers calm they have

692
00:46:15,320 --> 00:46:21,320
yeah assimilated it into its MTV cube or whatever you want to call it it's

693
00:46:21,320 --> 00:46:29,280
nice a load even slower now it's unique this will join the collective all right

694
00:46:29,280 --> 00:46:34,920
um of course you can't play video games all day long because if you played video

695
00:46:34,920 --> 00:46:39,200
games all day long you'd have no time to go out and live a rock-and-roll lifestyle

696
00:46:39,200 --> 00:46:43,560
So to remind you that there is a world out there outside of video games, Dark

697
00:46:43,560 --> 00:46:49,080
Sakura is here to present you her advice column. Some life tips to just remind you

698
00:46:49,080 --> 00:46:52,680
that there's a whole world out there. Go explore it. Dark Sakura, what are you

699
00:46:52,680 --> 00:46:57,280
giving us tips on tonight? Today's tip is how to ram the barricade. Oh, like if you're

700
00:46:57,280 --> 00:47:01,040
running away from the cops or something? Sort of. Okay, cool. If you're trying to break into somebody's yard.

701
00:47:01,040 --> 00:47:06,200
Oh, okay, cool. Number one, identify the barricade's weakest point. Either the

702
00:47:06,200 --> 00:47:11,600
barricade or gate that opens, or the place where a lock holds it closed, is usually the

703
00:47:11,600 --> 00:47:13,000
most vulnerable spot.

704
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:14,000
2.

705
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:15,840
Aim for the weak spot.

706
00:47:15,840 --> 00:47:19,560
If possible, use the rear of your car to ram the weak spot in the barricades.

707
00:47:19,560 --> 00:47:23,080
Ramming the front end may damage the engine and cause the car to stall.

708
00:47:23,080 --> 00:47:28,760
Unless you hit the rear wheel drive, I have an engine in the back, like a VW, but anyway

709
00:47:28,760 --> 00:47:29,760
I digress.

710
00:47:29,760 --> 00:47:30,760
3.

711
00:47:30,760 --> 00:47:33,200
Accelerate to a speed of 30-45 miles an hour.

712
00:47:33,200 --> 00:47:37,160
Duck just before impact if you are heading toward an extremely tall barricade or fence.

713
00:47:37,160 --> 00:47:41,720
Pieces of the barricade may come through your window, or the window may shatter.

714
00:47:41,720 --> 00:47:47,320
But my final piece of advice, don't go ramming, you know, don't try to go ram your way into

715
00:47:47,320 --> 00:47:51,440
the Neverland Ranch, because Michael Jackson is so not worth it.

716
00:47:51,440 --> 00:47:56,400
Wha wha wha, Loki!

717
00:47:56,400 --> 00:47:59,000
Any closing stories for us tonight, because we're about ready to wrap it up?

718
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:03,080
A few things, unfortunately Australia will not be seeing the 360 until March 2nd.

719
00:48:03,080 --> 00:48:05,080
Hopefully then they won't overheat.

720
00:48:05,080 --> 00:48:11,020
Yeah, honestly, Australia, I know you're pissed about this, but maybe the consoles will be

721
00:48:11,020 --> 00:48:14,240
a little more fine-tuned by the time you get them.

722
00:48:14,240 --> 00:48:19,680
If you need a reason why they hate Best Buy even more, apparently it's been shown that

723
00:48:19,680 --> 00:48:25,280
on numerous occasions, and this is not surprising one bit, they've been lying about how many

724
00:48:25,280 --> 00:48:29,920
Xboxes they're getting and employees have been pocketing them and selling them on eBay.

725
00:48:29,920 --> 00:48:31,720
Oh, snap.

726
00:48:31,720 --> 00:48:32,720
That is dirty.

727
00:48:32,720 --> 00:48:36,800
is dirty I thought I thought it was pretty you know I understand the need to

728
00:48:36,800 --> 00:48:39,840
get you know the game system to your employees as well but I always thought

729
00:48:39,840 --> 00:48:42,480
it was kind of shady when too many of them are going to the employees you

730
00:48:42,480 --> 00:48:46,520
really gotta you know don't if there's somebody working for you that just comes

731
00:48:46,520 --> 00:48:50,280
in on the weekends you know do they really get that same priority that the

732
00:48:50,280 --> 00:48:54,000
maybe the manager of the store has I don't know kind of interesting I don't

733
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:57,280
know I didn't happen to actually see some of the face plates that they have

734
00:48:57,280 --> 00:49:05,000
for the 360, ugly. That's all I gotta say. Should not be spending extra money on face

735
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:06,660
plates. Well, there were some cool ones that we talked

736
00:49:06,660 --> 00:49:10,240
about on a previous podcast, like if you're a Star Wars fan and all that. I remember that

737
00:49:10,240 --> 00:49:12,560
from a previous show. Yeah, okay. Well, it comes down to this,

738
00:49:12,560 --> 00:49:16,480
folks. If you really want a different face plate, there are websites out there, I believe

739
00:49:16,480 --> 00:49:23,300
Xbox 360 skins or something like that, you can actually design your own. Have it the

740
00:49:23,300 --> 00:49:26,080
way you want it. They have some really cool ones on that site.

741
00:49:26,080 --> 00:49:32,180
I thought about doing that and don't get ahead of me now.

742
00:49:32,180 --> 00:49:36,300
One of the things I thought was pretty cool that they were showing is the development

743
00:49:36,300 --> 00:49:41,540
team for the Xbox 360 have gotten their own special edition version of the Xbox, which

744
00:49:41,540 --> 00:49:42,700
is pretty bad ass.

745
00:49:42,700 --> 00:49:50,260
They've got concept art as well as just some different green highlights on the controller,

746
00:49:50,260 --> 00:49:52,260
which is pretty cool.

747
00:49:52,260 --> 00:49:55,060
So I wonder how long before we see that on eBay.

748
00:49:55,060 --> 00:50:01,940
And then my favorite thing, which I was just checking this out, basically they're going

749
00:50:01,940 --> 00:50:08,200
to say that Animal Crossing DS is going to be an extremely well selling game.

750
00:50:08,200 --> 00:50:12,260
They're saying they might actually outsell Nintendogs.

751
00:50:12,260 --> 00:50:18,700
And so far they've indicated that they've pre-sold 300,000 units, which beats out Nintendogs

752
00:50:18,700 --> 00:50:20,980
by almost double.

753
00:50:20,980 --> 00:50:26,320
You know, um, Mario Kart DS also, and I don't think this came up in any other story, but

754
00:50:26,320 --> 00:50:28,480
Mario Kart had a great first week.

755
00:50:28,480 --> 00:50:34,720
They say that, like, 41% of people that own Mario Kart DS went online with it in the first

756
00:50:34,720 --> 00:50:38,380
week as compared to 18% went online with Halo 2.

757
00:50:38,380 --> 00:50:42,080
And speaking of Nintendogs, they've already sold one million in Europe.

758
00:50:42,080 --> 00:50:43,640
Wow.

759
00:50:43,640 --> 00:50:44,640
One million copies.

760
00:50:44,640 --> 00:50:45,640
That's big.

761
00:50:45,640 --> 00:50:46,640
And I haven't fed my puppies in a month.

762
00:50:46,640 --> 00:50:47,640
Me neither.

763
00:50:47,640 --> 00:50:48,640
My doggies are long dead.

764
00:50:48,640 --> 00:50:49,880
I am so done with that game.

765
00:50:49,880 --> 00:50:50,880
Yeah.

766
00:50:50,880 --> 00:50:54,920
game everybody should check out which is coming out this week Mario and Luigi

767
00:50:54,920 --> 00:50:59,320
partners in time oh that's good now that's kind of the Mario Super Saga 2

768
00:50:59,320 --> 00:51:04,160
yeah that's cool that game was fun that's a good time so maybe if I can take

769
00:51:04,160 --> 00:51:09,080
a break from playing Dragon Quest I'll check that out all right one last story

770
00:51:09,080 --> 00:51:13,520
for you guys tonight and then we'll wrap it up a study by the Entertainment

771
00:51:13,520 --> 00:51:20,120
Software Association says that 31% of Americans plan to engage in a game

772
00:51:20,120 --> 00:51:25,640
exchange this year meaning that somebody's got a game on their Christmas

773
00:51:25,640 --> 00:51:29,480
list so it might not just be the hardcore gamers out there it sounds like

774
00:51:29,480 --> 00:51:33,820
a lot of people out there want to get their hands on a game they're saying 49

775
00:51:33,820 --> 00:51:40,080
percent of homes with children aged 12 to 17 will give or get a game this year

776
00:51:40,080 --> 00:51:46,520
only 43 percent when we're talking kids under 12 and 22 percent in a home without

777
00:51:46,520 --> 00:51:51,000
children which I think is still a pretty big number there so gaming is definitely

778
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:56,880
