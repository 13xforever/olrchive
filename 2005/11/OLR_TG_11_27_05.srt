[SPEAKER_03]: Orange Lounge Radio To Go Edition, week of November 28th, 2005.

2
00:00:02,551 --> 00:00:13,418
[SPEAKER_01]: You're tuned in to the Orange Lounge Radio To Go Edition, your podcast home for all the latest video game news and gamer chat.

3
00:00:13,658 --> 00:00:17,081
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, here are your hosts, DarkSakura, Sky, and Loki.

4
00:00:19,269 --> 00:00:20,729
[SPEAKER_01]: Hello, everybody.

5
00:00:20,869 --> 00:00:24,710
[SPEAKER_03]: Welcome to another edition of Orange Lounge Radio To Go.

6
00:00:25,450 --> 00:00:29,771
[SPEAKER_03]: It's that podcast dedicated to all things gaming, all the news you want to hear about.

7
00:00:30,271 --> 00:00:33,332
[SPEAKER_03]: And of course, as we always say, we like to talk about video games that don't suck.

8
00:00:33,752 --> 00:00:38,212
[SPEAKER_03]: Although sometimes we have to talk about video games that do suck just to warn you to stay the hell away.

9
00:00:38,933 --> 00:00:39,773
[SPEAKER_03]: My name is Rob Roberts.

10
00:00:39,793 --> 00:00:40,793
[SPEAKER_03]: You might know me as Sky.

11
00:00:40,913 --> 00:00:43,694
[SPEAKER_03]: Joining us, welcome back, DarkSakura.

12
00:00:43,774 --> 00:00:44,454
[SPEAKER_03]: We missed you.

13
00:00:44,754 --> 00:00:45,054
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi.

14
00:00:45,294 --> 00:00:45,774
[SPEAKER_03]: How are you doing?

15
00:00:46,494 --> 00:00:47,074
[SPEAKER_03]: Voiceless.

16
00:00:47,614 --> 00:00:48,074
[SPEAKER_03]: I know.

17
00:00:48,674 --> 00:00:51,775
[SPEAKER_03]: Now what, you have the, what we've been calling the wheel.

18
00:00:51,795 --> 00:00:52,275
[SPEAKER_03]: The plague.

19
00:00:52,955 --> 00:00:56,136
[SPEAKER_03]: Not the plague, the wheel of infection or whatever.

20
00:00:56,296 --> 00:00:58,957
[SPEAKER_03]: Because your doctor's telling you every week it's something different or something, right?

21
00:00:59,017 --> 00:01:02,877
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a cold that turned into a sinus infection while I was in L.A.

22
00:01:03,237 --> 00:01:04,718
[SPEAKER_00]: because I came back really sick.

23
00:01:04,838 --> 00:01:05,058
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.

24
00:01:05,498 --> 00:01:13,100
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he told me it was bronchitis but a chance that it was pneumonia and he put on my thing pneumonia and I had an x-ray and all that.

25
00:01:13,540 --> 00:01:15,180
[SPEAKER_00]: And this week he's telling me it's whooping cough.

26
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:38,056
[SPEAKER_03]: or it might be he's taking the cultures he stuck a q-tip up my nose ew it was gross it tickled i wanted to sneeze well well you're back and i know you're not feeling it 100 but we appreciate you being here and our listeners have said they've missed you so as i'm sure you've seen in the mailbag so is their aim improving they're trying some people out there haven't missed you but they don't know they don't know crap yeah but they suck screw them

27
00:01:38,928 --> 00:01:40,069
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki's here, as always.

28
00:01:40,089 --> 00:01:40,749
[SPEAKER_03]: Say hello to Loki.

29
00:01:41,070 --> 00:01:41,390
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm here.

30
00:01:41,570 --> 00:01:42,591
[SPEAKER_03]: No whooping cough for Loki.

31
00:01:42,851 --> 00:01:43,111
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

32
00:01:43,532 --> 00:01:44,092
[SPEAKER_03]: No whooping cough.

33
00:01:44,412 --> 00:01:45,733
[SPEAKER_00]: I can arrange for you to get the plague.

34
00:01:46,574 --> 00:01:47,214
[SPEAKER_02]: How you doing, Loki?

35
00:01:47,935 --> 00:01:48,856
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm doing good.

36
00:01:49,516 --> 00:01:49,756
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes?

37
00:01:50,137 --> 00:01:50,417
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

38
00:01:51,057 --> 00:01:56,221
[SPEAKER_02]: I could be doing better, had I had a 360, but I'm still doing good.

39
00:01:56,441 --> 00:01:57,642
[SPEAKER_03]: Crazy stuff with the 360 launch, huh?

40
00:01:59,878 --> 00:02:00,819
[SPEAKER_03]: Nothing I didn't expect.

41
00:02:14,850 --> 00:02:16,552
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, have you been able to fit in any time for gaming?

42
00:02:16,572 --> 00:02:19,335
[SPEAKER_03]: I know you've been sick, but what have you been playing, if anything?

43
00:02:19,355 --> 00:02:20,876
[SPEAKER_03]: I played some Katamari last night

44
00:02:36,045 --> 00:02:36,945
[SPEAKER_03]: New one or the old one?

45
00:02:36,985 --> 00:02:41,447
[SPEAKER_00]: The new one, but I got motion sick because my stomach was already feeling irritated.

46
00:02:43,367 --> 00:02:56,631
[SPEAKER_00]: I turned on World of Warcraft and then shut it back down again because I couldn't stand... It's just like, because I've been so disoriented, it's been driving me crazy to play anything, so I've been taking it kind of easy with gaming.

47
00:02:57,152 --> 00:03:01,333
[SPEAKER_00]: However, I did play some PSO Blue Burst while I was in L.A.,

48
00:03:02,734 --> 00:03:05,956
[SPEAKER_00]: and did watch somebody play through a couple of quests on the Xbox.

49
00:03:07,538 --> 00:03:09,879
[SPEAKER_03]: And didn't you get a chance to check out Xbox 360?

50
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:11,380
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, actually.

51
00:03:11,981 --> 00:03:29,113
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't play it because I just wasn't feeling well enough but I got to see Perfect Dark Zero which I thought was pretty cool and then Call of Duty and then Project Gotham Racing and Dan's been playing a whole lot of Need for Speed Underground so I've actually seen quite a bit of that.

52
00:03:30,117 --> 00:03:38,039
[SPEAKER_00]: and he compared it between Xbox and Xbox 360 and said that the 360 version really just seems like a port.

53
00:03:38,359 --> 00:03:41,039
[SPEAKER_00]: It's slower, not as much fun as the Xbox version.

54
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:42,600
[SPEAKER_03]: Interesting.

55
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:47,841
[SPEAKER_00]: And I got to see the BSOD on the Xbox 360.

56
00:03:47,961 --> 00:03:50,381
[SPEAKER_03]: Not the blue screen of death, but... The black screen of death!

57
00:03:50,502 --> 00:03:50,762
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.

58
00:03:53,530 --> 00:03:55,091
[SPEAKER_02]: What caused the black screen?

59
00:03:55,111 --> 00:03:55,831
[SPEAKER_02]: That's my ask.

60
00:03:55,851 --> 00:04:00,754
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it just got hot, but it was on the same game that I'm hearing most of the complaints about.

61
00:04:00,774 --> 00:04:05,657
[SPEAKER_00]: It was on... Call of Duty 2?

62
00:04:05,817 --> 00:04:05,997
[SPEAKER_00]: No.

63
00:04:06,797 --> 00:04:08,098
[SPEAKER_00]: On Project Gotham 3.

64
00:04:08,138 --> 00:04:10,679
[SPEAKER_03]: I was going to say, it's one of the racing games, if I remember right.

65
00:04:10,839 --> 00:04:17,863
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, in fact, one of our listeners had actually sent us an article about that, but I was going to say from experience, I've seen it happen.

66
00:04:18,303 --> 00:04:21,465
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was on that game, and most of the people I talked to said that it is on...

67
00:04:23,379 --> 00:04:28,025
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to say GTA, but it's Project Gotham.

68
00:04:28,105 --> 00:04:30,788
[SPEAKER_03]: And aren't they saying that it's all related to the power supply, basically?

69
00:04:32,190 --> 00:04:33,672
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that it's overheating.

70
00:04:33,712 --> 00:04:38,337
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know exactly why, but most of the people who run into the problems are playing with their game in a cabinet.

71
00:04:38,958 --> 00:04:40,160
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that's a common factor.

72
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:42,022
[SPEAKER_03]: Hmm.

73
00:04:44,966 --> 00:04:46,367
[SPEAKER_03]: Anything else you wanted to share with us, DarkSakura?

74
00:04:47,548 --> 00:04:48,548
[SPEAKER_00]: Not particularly.

75
00:04:49,409 --> 00:04:52,551
[SPEAKER_00]: Unless you want to hear the details of my illness, I doubt that.

76
00:04:52,571 --> 00:04:53,432
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe on another show.

77
00:04:53,672 --> 00:04:54,072
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki.

78
00:04:55,833 --> 00:05:02,478
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I took a little time off this week because of my car and being broken.

79
00:05:03,559 --> 00:05:09,343
[SPEAKER_02]: Meanwhile, while that was being worked out, I've been playing Mario Kart DS, and that's really fun.

80
00:05:10,203 --> 00:05:11,444
[SPEAKER_02]: I do not like snaking.

81
00:05:11,892 --> 00:05:13,153
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

82
00:05:35,726 --> 00:05:36,287
[SPEAKER_02]: That I have to say.

83
00:05:36,327 --> 00:05:38,208
[SPEAKER_02]: But other than that, I'm playing people that don't snake.

84
00:05:38,308 --> 00:05:40,130
[SPEAKER_02]: It's still really fun, because the games get really close.

85
00:05:40,150 --> 00:05:45,875
[SPEAKER_02]: We played a match earlier today, and man, down one race, man, down the line, it was just crazy.

86
00:05:45,895 --> 00:05:48,477
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, me, you, and Miklatov were all playing a match in the house, right?

87
00:05:48,638 --> 00:05:49,598
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, and that was fun.

88
00:05:49,678 --> 00:05:50,039
[SPEAKER_03]: Good times.

89
00:05:50,459 --> 00:05:58,626
[SPEAKER_02]: So I really wish there'd be more people on my friends list popping on during the day, but a lot of times, even doing worldwide, it's hard to get four players, which is really strange.

90
00:05:58,867 --> 00:06:01,569
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know why I'm right in that problem, but I don't know.

91
00:06:02,230 --> 00:06:02,310
[SPEAKER_02]: Um...

92
00:06:03,420 --> 00:06:05,221
[SPEAKER_02]: Grand Theft Auto Multiplayer Shadow of Colossus

93
00:06:31,437 --> 00:06:35,779
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think it's as big, huge, impressive game that everyone was saying.

94
00:06:36,099 --> 00:06:38,921
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks pretty, yeah, but that's about it.

95
00:06:38,941 --> 00:06:40,382
[SPEAKER_02]: There's really no content to the game.

96
00:06:55,490 --> 00:06:57,874
[SPEAKER_03]: It just looked a little boring.

97
00:06:57,894 --> 00:06:59,758
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not sure I like the concept itself.

98
00:06:59,818 --> 00:07:01,160
[SPEAKER_03]: It looked a little... It is boring.

99
00:07:01,180 --> 00:07:02,402
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no story to it, really.

100
00:07:02,422 --> 00:07:06,490
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe it's just my perspective and what I look for in a game, but it didn't look like my kind of thing.

101
00:07:07,997 --> 00:07:11,378
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't like the fact that there's no other enemies, no nothing.

102
00:07:11,838 --> 00:07:12,959
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no real puzzle.

103
00:07:13,039 --> 00:07:18,400
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, the only puzzle solving in the game is figuring out how to get on these Colossus and figuring out how to kill them.

104
00:07:18,641 --> 00:07:20,161
[SPEAKER_02]: But once you're done with that, you're done.

105
00:07:20,221 --> 00:07:22,022
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's only 16 of them in the game.

106
00:07:22,322 --> 00:07:29,004
[SPEAKER_02]: Granted, there is a hard mode, but when you go through the hard mode and the time modes or whatever, you can actually unlock more weapons to make it easier.

107
00:07:29,927 --> 00:07:31,528
[SPEAKER_02]: Why do you want the game to be easier?

108
00:07:31,628 --> 00:07:32,368
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to be shorter.

109
00:07:32,408 --> 00:07:38,832
[SPEAKER_02]: Doesn't it have some point where you can actually kill lizards and shoot fruit with a bow and arrow and stuff?

110
00:07:40,362 --> 00:07:41,243
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

111
00:08:10,951 --> 00:08:12,593
[SPEAKER_02]: I just want to get done with it so I can sell it back

112
00:08:29,235 --> 00:08:33,877
[SPEAKER_03]: Some games that I've been playing this week, I checked out the Final Fantasy XII demo and I gotta say I'm pretty impressed.

113
00:08:34,718 --> 00:08:45,183
[SPEAKER_03]: They did change some stuff from what I saw at E3 two years ago in regards to the battle system because it looks like now with the battle system that there's not the boxes around the screen or anything.

114
00:08:45,223 --> 00:08:58,589
[SPEAKER_03]: It is very seamless where you are walking around and it's unlike other Final Fantasy games in the past, except for XI of course, where you, but I know a lot of people didn't play that, where you walk up to something and engage it like in real time and it's very different from Final Fantasy's of the past.

115
00:08:58,889 --> 00:09:13,978
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think what's very interesting about the battle system, which is pretty much all that this demo really allows you to see is the battle system, is that you basically, it kind of fuses XI with the old battle systems, which I think is very interesting because there's a lot about XI I really did like.

116
00:09:14,558 --> 00:09:20,822
[SPEAKER_03]: And the thing is that your party members, if you want them to, will do their own things.

117
00:09:21,002 --> 00:09:23,884
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's almost like you're playing online but with intelligent people.

118
00:09:28,086 --> 00:09:36,792
[SPEAKER_03]: I was a little disappointed with the summon sequences, even though they're grand and overdone like they are in every Final Fantasy game.

119
00:09:36,812 --> 00:09:39,373
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know, I was expecting something a little bit different.

120
00:09:39,413 --> 00:09:41,174
[SPEAKER_03]: A little bit of load time problems there, but nothing...

121
00:09:42,515 --> 00:09:44,696
[SPEAKER_03]: I can see the pixelation really bad on my TV.

122
00:09:44,716 --> 00:09:44,976
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry.

123
00:10:06,464 --> 00:10:08,185
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm having microphone problems tonight, sorry guys.

124
00:10:09,665 --> 00:10:15,347
[SPEAKER_03]: It would look very pixelated on my TV, and if that's the way that the game actually looks when it comes out, I'm going to be sorely disappointed.

125
00:10:16,407 --> 00:10:18,068
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sure this is just because it's a demo.

126
00:10:18,168 --> 00:10:33,032
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm very sure it's just the demo, and the movies will look fantastic, but I couldn't help but kind of sense a little bit of disappointment because I wanted to see in the demo a little bit that, you know, nice looking game, you know, the rendering sequences and everything, so...

127
00:10:34,152 --> 00:10:38,956
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, obviously, if I got the Final Fantasy XII demo, I must be playing Dragon Quest VIII, which is true.

128
00:10:38,997 --> 00:10:40,378
[SPEAKER_03]: I picked up a copy of Dragon Quest VIII.

129
00:10:40,678 --> 00:10:43,761
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a lot of stuff I really like about Dragon Quest VIII.

130
00:10:44,341 --> 00:10:51,267
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm gonna be honest with you guys, I haven't really been into a Dragon Warrior or Dragon Quest game since the very, very first game on the NES.

131
00:10:51,647 --> 00:10:52,027
[SPEAKER_03]: I've kind of...

132
00:10:52,768 --> 00:10:54,349
[SPEAKER_03]: Just slept through the rest of the series.

133
00:10:54,389 --> 00:10:56,090
[SPEAKER_03]: I never played the one that was out on PlayStation.

134
00:10:56,390 --> 00:10:58,852
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't bother to play... Well, of course, a lot of them didn't even come out here.

135
00:10:59,152 --> 00:11:00,953
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't bother to play any of the other ones on the NES.

136
00:11:01,213 --> 00:11:02,794
[SPEAKER_03]: So I kind of napped through a lot of Dragon Quest.

137
00:11:02,834 --> 00:11:05,416
[SPEAKER_03]: But I'm, for some reason, finding myself really liking this one.

138
00:11:05,996 --> 00:11:17,123
[SPEAKER_03]: It's definitely an old-style RPG, which is good and, you know, maybe not good for some people, but good for me because it's definitely a throwback to, like, the older games where it's like, you know, the enemies are there, attack, magic.

139
00:11:17,143 --> 00:11:17,864
[SPEAKER_03]: It's very basic.

140
00:11:17,884 --> 00:11:19,385
[SPEAKER_03]: They don't try to overdo it with all these...

141
00:11:20,529 --> 00:11:24,894
[SPEAKER_03]: They don't try to overdo it with all these crazy concepts or anything during the battles.

142
00:11:24,934 --> 00:11:25,795
[SPEAKER_03]: So I like it.

143
00:11:25,855 --> 00:11:26,456
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a good game.

144
00:11:27,077 --> 00:11:29,199
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of good graphics, too.

145
00:11:29,239 --> 00:11:36,188
[SPEAKER_03]: It's got a very different graphical style to it, obviously, because some of the graphics were done by a famous anime guy and

146
00:11:37,590 --> 00:11:41,155
[SPEAKER_03]: The only disappointment I would say that I have with the game is the cut sequences.

147
00:11:41,495 --> 00:11:47,223
[SPEAKER_03]: There's some cut sequences in there that have a lot of load time, and the voice acting is very slow.

148
00:11:47,563 --> 00:11:52,330
[SPEAKER_03]: And I find myself wanting to push the X button before the cut sequence finishes, usually.

149
00:11:53,371 --> 00:11:57,653
[SPEAKER_03]: Just to get through the cut sequences there, I usually want to push the X button just to get through them.

150
00:11:58,794 --> 00:12:00,775
[SPEAKER_03]: I apologize again, you guys, but I have a crazy mic tonight.

151
00:12:00,815 --> 00:12:02,595
[SPEAKER_03]: I might have to pass back and forth with somebody else here.

152
00:12:02,615 --> 00:12:07,918
[SPEAKER_00]: For the record, it's Toriyama, who did Dragon Ball Z. Thank you, I couldn't remember that name.

153
00:12:07,938 --> 00:12:10,659
[SPEAKER_03]: I knew he did Dragon Ball Z. Dr. Slump and Classic.

154
00:12:10,679 --> 00:12:12,540
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the only thing that turns me off about that game.

155
00:12:12,580 --> 00:12:14,301
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't like Dragon Ball Z at all.

156
00:12:14,881 --> 00:12:18,983
[SPEAKER_03]: But, you know, a lot of the character animations are very funny, like a lot of the animals.

157
00:12:19,023 --> 00:12:25,305
[SPEAKER_03]: The monsters are very similar to what you saw in the old Dragon Warrior games, you know, the slimes and everything.

158
00:12:25,586 --> 00:12:29,747
[SPEAKER_03]: But they do some funny things, like they'll make your characters dance, and the dancing motions are hilarious.

159
00:12:29,827 --> 00:12:30,228
[SPEAKER_03]: I love it.

160
00:12:30,328 --> 00:12:30,728
[SPEAKER_03]: It's great.

161
00:12:30,808 --> 00:12:33,029
[SPEAKER_03]: So, yeah, I definitely...

162
00:12:33,749 --> 00:12:42,311
[SPEAKER_03]: I recommend Dragon Quest VIII if you're a fan of roleplaying games, especially if you're looking for a throwback to a very old, less complicated RPG type game.

163
00:12:42,751 --> 00:12:43,692
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of work, though.

164
00:12:43,932 --> 00:12:47,132
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not something you can just play through very quickly and watch the cutscenes.

165
00:12:47,432 --> 00:12:50,313
[SPEAKER_03]: You will die if you don't take some time to stop and gain experience.

166
00:12:50,333 --> 00:12:51,914
[SPEAKER_03]: And that bugs some people, so I don't know.

167
00:12:52,154 --> 00:13:01,356
[SPEAKER_02]: Granted, though, if you are still looking for a throwback to really old games and stuff, especially old RPGs, Wild Arms Alter Code F, which came out a couple weeks ago,

168
00:13:01,812 --> 00:13:11,474
[SPEAKER_02]: and Romancing Saga, which came out a couple months ago, which was the original Saga Frontier, so both remakes of their original counterparts should be pretty good, too.

169
00:13:12,635 --> 00:13:15,715
[SPEAKER_02]: And, oh, and, and, and, in a couple weeks, Final Fantasy IV.

170
00:13:17,396 --> 00:13:19,016
[SPEAKER_03]: What's the street date on that, do we know?

171
00:13:19,696 --> 00:13:26,258
[SPEAKER_02]: Second week in, or no, wait, yeah, second week, second real week in December, so around the week of the 12th, I think.

172
00:13:27,738 --> 00:13:28,999
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm definitely looking forward to that.

173
00:13:29,219 --> 00:13:30,139
[SPEAKER_00]: You spoony bard.

174
00:13:32,866 --> 00:13:34,747
[SPEAKER_03]: I think we'll start off getting into the news tonight.

175
00:13:34,807 --> 00:13:44,111
[SPEAKER_03]: However, I want to issue a couple of corrections to things we've talked about on previous podcasts because, you know, we're human, we're gaming fans, and we sometimes make mistakes.

176
00:13:44,752 --> 00:13:47,853
[SPEAKER_03]: This first one isn't so much a mistake as it is a clarification.

177
00:13:47,873 --> 00:13:52,715
[SPEAKER_03]: A couple podcasts ago we were talking about Guild Wars, and I said that NCSoft makes Guild Wars.

178
00:13:53,115 --> 00:14:00,640
[SPEAKER_03]: And somebody over on our forums, a main fan over on the forums, wanted to clarify that ArenaNet actually made Guild Wars, and they deserve the credit.

179
00:14:01,060 --> 00:14:03,102
[SPEAKER_03]: NCSoft simply publishes the game.

180
00:14:03,982 --> 00:14:12,468
[SPEAKER_03]: Which is interesting because it kind of brings up this whole thing about, you know, usually it is the publishers that get the credit because they're the ones that are, you know, paying for the advertising and all that stuff that are, you know...

181
00:14:13,068 --> 00:14:13,608
[SPEAKER_03]: and so on.

182
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:37,381
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm definitely willing to issue that clarification there.

183
00:14:38,322 --> 00:14:44,706
[SPEAKER_03]: But just be careful with what you read out there because sometimes the people who are publishing the game may not necessarily be making it.

184
00:14:44,726 --> 00:14:48,828
[SPEAKER_03]: A classic example would be Nintendo publishes a lot of stuff that they don't necessarily do.

185
00:14:49,148 --> 00:14:50,209
[SPEAKER_03]: Like the old Rare games.

186
00:14:51,049 --> 00:14:51,449
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

187
00:14:52,630 --> 00:14:52,870
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway.

188
00:14:54,031 --> 00:14:54,571
[SPEAKER_03]: Something to think about.

189
00:14:54,591 --> 00:15:03,195
[SPEAKER_03]: The other clarification we would like to make was related to something that we talked about previously last week and it had to do with the Chinese gamer and the parents were suing Blizzard.

190
00:15:03,676 --> 00:15:09,879
[SPEAKER_03]: He was not a World of Warcraft player because World of Warcraft wasn't really out in China until May of this year.

191
00:15:10,279 --> 00:15:19,524
[SPEAKER_03]: It was actually Warcraft 3 was the game that the Chinese gamer committed suicide after playing and the parents are still suing Blizzard because of it.

192
00:15:20,025 --> 00:15:28,945
[SPEAKER_03]: But of course, this just goes to show, because we get our news from other sources, obviously, because there's very few companies that send us releases directly.

193
00:15:30,270 --> 00:15:30,830
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

194
00:15:51,025 --> 00:15:52,086
[SPEAKER_00]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

195
00:16:12,415 --> 00:16:13,955
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just stupidity.

196
00:16:14,435 --> 00:16:16,036
[SPEAKER_00]: Taking the bad genes out of the gene pool.

197
00:16:16,376 --> 00:16:18,936
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, let's start off with our first story tonight.

198
00:16:18,996 --> 00:16:23,157
[SPEAKER_03]: And I said for tonight's first story I wanted to do anything besides an Xbox 360 story.

199
00:16:23,217 --> 00:16:25,578
[SPEAKER_03]: Just because I'm too oversaturated.

200
00:16:25,758 --> 00:16:28,058
[SPEAKER_03]: And believe me, we have plenty of Xbox 360 things to talk about.

201
00:16:28,078 --> 00:16:30,499
[SPEAKER_03]: But I said anything but an Xbox 360 story.

202
00:16:31,479 --> 00:16:33,359
[SPEAKER_03]: So we have something better.

203
00:16:33,719 --> 00:16:35,000
[SPEAKER_03]: We have a story about 50 Cent.

204
00:16:36,140 --> 00:16:36,580
[SPEAKER_02]: He's retarded.

205
00:16:38,239 --> 00:16:41,700
[SPEAKER_03]: 50 Cent actually has this game, 50 Cent Bulletproof, which came out recently.

206
00:16:42,181 --> 00:16:46,583
[SPEAKER_03]: And sexual themes, intense violence, use of drugs, blood and gore.

207
00:16:46,943 --> 00:16:48,664
[SPEAKER_03]: No surprise this game has an M rating, right?

208
00:16:49,344 --> 00:16:54,667
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, guess what Curtis Jackson, also known as 50 Cent, said in a recent interview with Reuters.

209
00:16:55,388 --> 00:16:59,470
[SPEAKER_03]: Just because it is rated mature doesn't mean you shouldn't buy it for your kids.

210
00:17:00,711 --> 00:17:01,791
[SPEAKER_03]: No, actually, that's what it means.

211
00:17:01,932 --> 00:17:03,392
[SPEAKER_03]: Hold on, hold on, though, now, wait a minute.

212
00:17:03,412 --> 00:17:05,693
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I think this is where most people stopped reading.

213
00:17:06,093 --> 00:17:10,195
[SPEAKER_03]: And here's what the rest of what 50 Cent has to say.

214
00:17:10,835 --> 00:17:15,357
[SPEAKER_03]: He said, play the game and explain to them what they are playing.

215
00:17:16,658 --> 00:17:20,239
[SPEAKER_03]: So he's saying that parents should play the game and then explain to the kids what they are playing.

216
00:17:20,619 --> 00:17:20,780
[SPEAKER_03]: So...

217
00:17:21,980 --> 00:17:24,101
[SPEAKER_03]: I think the intentions might be good here.

218
00:17:24,582 --> 00:17:29,865
[SPEAKER_03]: I know I wouldn't let my kid play this type of game because that's just too much violence and sex and all that stuff.

219
00:17:30,626 --> 00:17:40,552
[SPEAKER_03]: But I do like the fact, I think many people pass this off as 50 Cent is crazy, but I do like the fact that he is saying, parents, play the game with your child.

220
00:17:40,672 --> 00:17:42,153
[SPEAKER_03]: Parents, get involved.

221
00:17:42,753 --> 00:17:50,658
[SPEAKER_03]: Even though maybe he didn't say it the right way, I at least kind of give him a little bit of credit for trying to say that the parents should be involved, although maybe he wasn't.

222
00:17:50,779 --> 00:17:51,139
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

223
00:17:51,599 --> 00:17:52,779
[SPEAKER_03]: But, what do you think?

224
00:17:53,139 --> 00:17:58,700
[SPEAKER_02]: I think what he's saying is, oh my god, my game was released one week after True Crime New York City.

225
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:00,461
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not going to sell very well.

226
00:18:00,681 --> 00:18:02,461
[SPEAKER_02]: Kids, please buy my game because I need the money.

227
00:18:04,321 --> 00:18:06,262
[SPEAKER_00]: He's just not thinking.

228
00:18:06,582 --> 00:18:07,762
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all it is.

229
00:18:08,942 --> 00:18:12,123
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought he was like, you can use this as a teaching tool.

230
00:18:12,183 --> 00:18:15,723
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, maybe this is too loud.

231
00:18:15,763 --> 00:18:18,484
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe it could be a teaching tool of sorts.

232
00:18:19,344 --> 00:18:19,584
[SPEAKER_00]: But,

233
00:18:20,774 --> 00:18:26,497
[SPEAKER_00]: In the real world, kids are just gonna go, oh, 50 Cent said I should play this violent game, blah blah blah blah blah.

234
00:18:29,378 --> 00:18:29,838
[SPEAKER_00]: Whatever.

235
00:18:32,219 --> 00:18:37,021
[SPEAKER_03]: I wouldn't be surprised if they'd taken him completely out of context in this interview, because you know that stuff happens all the time.

236
00:18:37,081 --> 00:18:39,922
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki, you wouldn't know anything about being taken out of context in an interview.

237
00:18:40,223 --> 00:18:41,123
[SPEAKER_00]: Isn't it so much fun?

238
00:18:45,681 --> 00:18:45,981
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright.

239
00:18:48,284 --> 00:18:51,106
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess now we can talk a little bit about Xbox 360.

240
00:18:52,288 --> 00:18:53,229
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's talk about this.

241
00:18:53,909 --> 00:18:56,112
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if you knew this, but Microsoft is taking $126...

242
00:18:58,732 --> 00:19:01,753
[SPEAKER_03]: They're writing it off for every Xbox 360 system they sell.

243
00:19:02,214 --> 00:19:08,457
[SPEAKER_03]: And while this may sound shocking, it actually isn't that uncommon because the gaming companies really make their money back on the games.

244
00:19:08,917 --> 00:19:14,260
[SPEAKER_03]: So just so you know, if you wanted to know how much of a loss Microsoft's taking on these consoles, $126.

245
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:16,781
[SPEAKER_03]: And that doesn't count when you throw in all these peripherals.

246
00:19:16,801 --> 00:19:18,142
[SPEAKER_03]: This is just the console itself.

247
00:19:18,602 --> 00:19:19,502
[SPEAKER_03]: So kind of interesting.

248
00:19:20,102 --> 00:19:24,845
[SPEAKER_03]: Microsoft also saying that they are aware of the shortages and they are pushing...

249
00:19:26,346 --> 00:19:31,408
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a quote from Peter Moore, the Corporate Vice President of Worldwide Marketing and Publishing.

250
00:19:31,428 --> 00:19:36,630
[SPEAKER_03]: He said, Our goal is to replenish inventory in the channel every week.

251
00:19:36,991 --> 00:19:40,052
[SPEAKER_03]: So lots of Xbox 360s are flowing in every single week.

252
00:19:40,352 --> 00:19:43,193
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not like we're shipping and then going dry for two or three weeks.

253
00:19:43,794 --> 00:19:45,094
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki, do you have anything to add to this mess?

254
00:19:45,414 --> 00:19:51,978
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, basically, he's quoted saying, and I just saw this earlier, because they basically...

255
00:19:53,592 --> 00:19:56,694
[SPEAKER_02]: They're not going to be short at all with what's coming out here.

256
00:19:56,954 --> 00:19:57,715
[SPEAKER_02]: I wish I had the article.

257
00:19:57,755 --> 00:19:59,476
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, here we go.

258
00:19:59,936 --> 00:20:08,201
[SPEAKER_02]: Basically, Major Nelson, the guy who's behind a lot of this launch stuff, he was visiting his family here on the East Coast.

259
00:20:08,282 --> 00:20:12,304
[SPEAKER_02]: He took the opportunity over the past couple of days to stop at various retailers.

260
00:20:18,757 --> 00:20:24,181
[SPEAKER_02]: I double checked with the retail team and while I can't speak to each retail outlet's specific distribution strategy, I can tell you that we...

261
00:20:43,789 --> 00:20:45,210
[SPEAKER_02]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

262
00:21:12,510 --> 00:21:16,093
[SPEAKER_03]: And you know these Xbox 360s have been reporting crashing in DarkSakura.

263
00:21:16,113 --> 00:21:17,734
[SPEAKER_03]: You saw one of these things crash.

264
00:21:17,994 --> 00:21:20,736
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, to be perfectly honest, we got the BSOD once.

265
00:21:21,277 --> 00:21:27,201
[SPEAKER_00]: And then after that, I actually just saw it freeze without anything.

266
00:21:27,562 --> 00:21:29,183
[SPEAKER_00]: Just completely froze in the middle of a race.

267
00:21:33,046 --> 00:21:36,648
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, apparently you can actually fix these crashing Xbox 360s.

268
00:21:36,688 --> 00:21:41,772
[SPEAKER_03]: This was something that was posted over on GameSpot forums, that you can actually fix it with string.

269
00:21:42,132 --> 00:21:51,478
[SPEAKER_03]: All you have to do, hang it from above the ground, because the problem is that in these cabinets and stuff, they're overheating, because there's no way for it to effectively cool down.

270
00:21:51,498 --> 00:21:54,360
[SPEAKER_02]: The power supply is overheating, and I might clear that up.

271
00:21:54,741 --> 00:21:59,104
[SPEAKER_02]: But the problem is, the power supply does have a fan, and like any console, you want to keep it...

272
00:22:00,322 --> 00:22:00,622
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura.com

273
00:22:30,373 --> 00:22:33,315
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually had a lot of the same issue.

274
00:22:33,555 --> 00:22:36,336
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember when the Dreamcast was released saying that it was overheating.

275
00:22:38,417 --> 00:22:47,502
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, what we used to do was we actually had a box set out until we started using our PS2 as a Dreamcast stand and letting it air out.

276
00:22:48,018 --> 00:22:52,400
[SPEAKER_00]: because all you have to do is keep those vents free of any obstruction and it does just fine.

277
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:53,001
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what?

278
00:22:53,021 --> 00:22:56,883
[SPEAKER_02]: Some third-party company is going to come out just like they did with the original PlayStation.

279
00:22:56,903 --> 00:23:00,845
[SPEAKER_02]: Remember the fan that straps to the side of it and blows air through it so it doesn't overheat it.

280
00:23:02,025 --> 00:23:05,747
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe the same thing could set the power supply in something and it cools it off.

281
00:23:05,767 --> 00:23:07,988
[SPEAKER_03]: Or maybe you could not release a console that overheats.

282
00:23:08,429 --> 00:23:08,869
[SPEAKER_03]: How about that?

283
00:23:09,169 --> 00:23:09,889
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that might be good.

284
00:23:11,210 --> 00:23:12,951
[SPEAKER_00]: I tell you, they're falling into the Dreamcast trap.

285
00:23:13,737 --> 00:23:15,479
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, you have something about the N-Gage, right?

286
00:23:15,499 --> 00:23:16,419
[SPEAKER_03]: This made me smile.

287
00:23:24,071 --> 00:23:26,873
[SPEAKER_00]: Nokia shifts focus from gaming.

288
00:23:27,373 --> 00:23:28,714
[SPEAKER_00]: And how long did this take them?

289
00:23:30,596 --> 00:23:41,283
[SPEAKER_00]: Nokia's VP of Corporate Strategy, I guess I'm pronouncing this right, Antti Vasara, has confirmed that there are no plans for future versions of the N-Gage.

290
00:23:41,743 --> 00:23:47,907
[SPEAKER_00]: They are turning their focus toward mobile TV and music with the introduction of handsets like the N91.

291
00:23:49,228 --> 00:23:51,690
[SPEAKER_00]: A smartphone that can hold up to 3,000 music tracks.

292
00:23:52,991 --> 00:24:00,776
[SPEAKER_00]: They're planning on placing a greater emphasis on mobile gaming in 2007, which by that time, screen sizes and quality will offer better games.

293
00:24:01,456 --> 00:24:06,799
[SPEAKER_02]: And also the other thing is they're going to be introducing, they don't want just one platform dedicated to gaming.

294
00:24:06,820 --> 00:24:11,863
[SPEAKER_02]: They're actually going to be incorporating to all their M60 phones, which will be coming out.

295
00:24:11,943 --> 00:24:16,786
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's another reason why that they shouldn't be supporting the N-Gage.

296
00:24:17,025 --> 00:24:22,728
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the quote I have from him is, N-Gage is still being sold, but it was not success in the sense of developing a new category.

297
00:24:22,748 --> 00:24:26,310
[SPEAKER_03]: So, N-Gage, we bid thee farewell.

298
00:24:30,793 --> 00:24:31,133
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.

299
00:24:32,694 --> 00:24:33,834
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, darn, what a loss.

300
00:24:34,275 --> 00:24:40,738
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry, I think we've been doing this for like 45 weeks now, and I haven't yet to use the soundboard for anything, so I had to do that.

301
00:24:43,830 --> 00:24:45,032
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry, the N-Gage was crappy.

302
00:24:45,893 --> 00:24:47,594
[SPEAKER_03]: I tried to like this system so bad.

303
00:24:47,654 --> 00:24:48,876
[SPEAKER_03]: I tried to play it at E3.

304
00:24:50,037 --> 00:24:50,878
[SPEAKER_00]: You have an N-Gage?

305
00:24:50,918 --> 00:24:51,999
[SPEAKER_00]: We gave it away.

306
00:24:53,100 --> 00:24:53,420
[SPEAKER_03]: It's bad.

307
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:55,603
[SPEAKER_00]: It was the first model taco phone.

308
00:24:56,964 --> 00:24:57,224
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

309
00:24:58,505 --> 00:25:06,614
[SPEAKER_03]: Speaking of something that should be sent far, far away, something about Jack Thompson, and I don't like bringing this guy up every week, but you got something funny.

310
00:25:07,392 --> 00:25:19,215
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, actually one of our regular listeners, Rob with two B's, he's actually sent me several articles and one of them I thought was about time.

311
00:25:19,795 --> 00:25:23,336
[SPEAKER_00]: Jack Thompson's Alabama license was revoked.

312
00:25:24,176 --> 00:25:29,917
[SPEAKER_00]: He had been basically shipped out before, you know, while they reviewed it, but his license is actually gone.

313
00:25:30,358 --> 00:25:32,178
[SPEAKER_00]: He cannot practice law in the state of Alabama.

314
00:25:33,049 --> 00:25:37,852
[SPEAKER_03]: Which just goes to show you, boys and girls, do not fuck with the gaming community.

315
00:25:38,573 --> 00:25:39,833
[SPEAKER_03]: Just kidding, don't sue me.

316
00:25:40,354 --> 00:25:40,794
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course.

317
00:25:43,135 --> 00:25:59,966
[SPEAKER_00]: He fired back at Judge Moore by claiming that the judge had violated the Alabama canons of judicial ethics by his unfortunate, improper, and prejudicial acts in this case at the expense of three bereaved Alabama families.

318
00:26:00,066 --> 00:26:02,048
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, let me guess, he's an activist judge.

319
00:26:02,068 --> 00:26:02,128
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

320
00:26:03,058 --> 00:26:03,659
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what?

321
00:26:04,059 --> 00:26:09,865
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's because there's somebody with some common sense in my home state, excuse me, who thought that you were a big loser.

322
00:26:10,045 --> 00:26:10,586
[SPEAKER_00]: How about that?

323
00:26:11,467 --> 00:26:14,150
[SPEAKER_02]: Too bad he practices law mainly out of Florida.

324
00:26:15,571 --> 00:26:15,852
[SPEAKER_02]: Who cares?

325
00:26:16,672 --> 00:26:18,134
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry to any of our listeners in Florida.

326
00:26:19,676 --> 00:26:20,977
[SPEAKER_03]: Moving on, Loki, what else?

327
00:26:21,017 --> 00:26:22,098
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry, you have to put up with him.

328
00:26:22,599 --> 00:26:23,600
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki, what else do you have for us?

329
00:26:23,991 --> 00:26:31,495
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, other than overheating Xboxes, we're hearing reports of scratching discs in the Xboxes as well.

330
00:26:32,156 --> 00:26:34,617
[SPEAKER_02]: Some people are saying, don't play your Xbox vertical.

331
00:26:34,717 --> 00:26:36,398
[SPEAKER_02]: Some are saying, don't play it horizontal.

332
00:26:37,058 --> 00:26:38,499
[SPEAKER_02]: Some people are just saying, don't play it at all.

333
00:26:38,559 --> 00:26:42,321
[SPEAKER_02]: But basically, no matter what you do, your disc will get scratched.

334
00:26:43,757 --> 00:26:47,439
[SPEAKER_02]: Basically, the moral of the story is don't tip your Xbox over while you're playing it.

335
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:53,103
[SPEAKER_02]: It goes to show you that they're really rushes the market if they haven't found out, oh, you have these detrimental things.

336
00:26:53,143 --> 00:26:54,383
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, this is scratching disk.

337
00:26:54,683 --> 00:26:56,685
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe that's not a good feature they put in there.

338
00:26:58,546 --> 00:26:59,887
[SPEAKER_02]: So that was kind of interesting.

339
00:27:00,387 --> 00:27:06,370
[SPEAKER_02]: The other one that I thought was kind of funny is they were talking about the Xbox 360 DVD player.

340
00:27:06,791 --> 00:27:07,331
[SPEAKER_02]: They're saying it's...

341
00:27:07,859 --> 00:27:09,460
[SPEAKER_03]: Not very good, actually.

342
00:27:10,401 --> 00:27:13,042
[SPEAKER_03]: Funny, neither was the Xbox's DVD player.

343
00:27:13,122 --> 00:27:14,723
[SPEAKER_03]: No progressive scan, excuse me?

344
00:27:15,023 --> 00:27:17,185
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not nearly as awful as the PS2.

345
00:27:17,225 --> 00:27:27,271
[SPEAKER_02]: They were testing it on Episode 3 and said it looked decent, but this person who was reviewing it, their Samsung progressive player blew it out of the water.

346
00:27:28,132 --> 00:27:30,173
[SPEAKER_02]: So it sounds like no progressive on this one either.

347
00:27:31,253 --> 00:27:32,534
[SPEAKER_03]: You've got to be kidding me.

348
00:27:32,614 --> 00:27:35,236
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I swear I read an article that said they had it.

349
00:27:36,693 --> 00:27:38,774
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sure some listener is going to email us one way or the other.

350
00:27:40,235 --> 00:27:40,676
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what?

351
00:27:40,716 --> 00:27:44,398
[SPEAKER_00]: You shouldn't be using your video game system as a DVD player anyway.

352
00:27:45,519 --> 00:27:46,340
[SPEAKER_03]: Some of us are cheap.

353
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:47,300
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what?

354
00:27:47,340 --> 00:27:54,966
[SPEAKER_00]: You can go to Sam's Club and pay $50 and get a DVD player that will do everything you need it to do.

355
00:27:55,606 --> 00:27:58,789
[SPEAKER_02]: And finally, with every video game system launch...

356
00:27:59,249 --> 00:28:02,811
[SPEAKER_02]: There's always going to be a campaign to put Linux on it.

357
00:28:02,851 --> 00:28:03,411
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right.

358
00:28:04,912 --> 00:28:15,158
[SPEAKER_02]: Free60, the Free60 project, is aiming to put Linux, such as Darwin, on the Xbox 360.

359
00:28:15,739 --> 00:28:20,161
[SPEAKER_02]: And they've gathered lots of useful, detailed information surrounding inner workings of the 360.

360
00:28:20,741 --> 00:28:25,024
[SPEAKER_02]: For example, apparently the Xbox 360 is secured down by the following.

361
00:28:25,064 --> 00:28:26,885
[SPEAKER_02]: A flash that's encrypted.

362
00:28:27,352 --> 00:28:27,913
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura,

363
00:28:43,115 --> 00:28:43,975
[SPEAKER_02]: Voila, homebrew.

364
00:28:46,796 --> 00:28:58,660
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, although I've kind of made fun of the people that install Linux on systems in the past, honestly, I do get the point of this when it comes to the Xbox 360 because it does open the door to all this neat homebrew stuff.

365
00:28:59,140 --> 00:29:03,341
[SPEAKER_03]: It's when you try to install Linux on like a toaster and a Billy Bass that I kind of go, what?

366
00:29:03,481 --> 00:29:04,201
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, it's been done.

367
00:29:04,461 --> 00:29:06,302
[SPEAKER_03]: Or a speak and spell, I know it's been done.

368
00:29:06,322 --> 00:29:07,562
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like, you know, come on.

369
00:29:09,363 --> 00:29:12,364
[SPEAKER_03]: What is the practical, I mean, what are you going to run on a Billy Bass?

370
00:29:13,931 --> 00:29:14,573
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, Harry Potter

371
00:29:22,591 --> 00:29:25,112
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, because I actually just saw the movie this week.

372
00:29:25,172 --> 00:29:25,752
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm so happy.

373
00:29:26,352 --> 00:29:29,012
[SPEAKER_03]: I decided to see Rent instead, actually.

374
00:29:29,373 --> 00:29:30,873
[SPEAKER_03]: And I do want to see Harry Potter.

375
00:29:30,893 --> 00:29:34,014
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm thinking of that song from Team America.

376
00:29:34,254 --> 00:29:37,454
[SPEAKER_03]: I want the kids to be gone.

377
00:29:37,514 --> 00:29:39,715
[SPEAKER_03]: And I couldn't help but think about that the whole time I was watching.

378
00:29:40,815 --> 00:29:42,415
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to get hate mail over this, but I hated Rent.

379
00:29:42,435 --> 00:29:43,116
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought it was awful.

380
00:29:43,656 --> 00:29:45,376
[SPEAKER_03]: The whole time I was sitting there going, get a job!

381
00:29:46,116 --> 00:29:46,656
[SPEAKER_03]: Get a job!

382
00:29:47,317 --> 00:29:48,297
[SPEAKER_00]: I still want to see it.

383
00:29:48,477 --> 00:29:49,237
[SPEAKER_03]: Or get AIDS.

384
00:29:49,981 --> 00:29:53,964
[SPEAKER_00]: But it was supposed to be a retelling of La Boheme.

385
00:29:56,345 --> 00:29:57,706
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, but then they, never mind.

386
00:29:58,266 --> 00:30:00,307
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, Harry Potter.

387
00:30:00,968 --> 00:30:01,768
[SPEAKER_00]: Harry Potter.

388
00:30:03,769 --> 00:30:11,374
[SPEAKER_00]: Electronic Arts released a one-level demo for the movie tie-in for Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, and it's available for download.

389
00:30:14,778 --> 00:30:16,220
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure if it's on EA's site.

390
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:18,824
[SPEAKER_00]: I know they have a link to it from Eurogamer.

391
00:30:20,667 --> 00:30:25,676
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would suggest go there, click on the article about the Harry Potter demo and give it a download because it's supposed to be pretty cool.

392
00:30:27,387 --> 00:30:32,710
[SPEAKER_03]: I saw it for like half a minute at E3, and I was like, that looks kind of neat.

393
00:30:33,010 --> 00:30:41,075
[SPEAKER_03]: I did play like Harry Potter DS for like two seconds, and I just knew that you, I did the little spell thing with the stylus, and I thought that was kind of funny.

394
00:30:41,455 --> 00:30:42,376
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I don't know.

395
00:30:43,176 --> 00:30:46,798
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't buy a lot of the movie tie-ins unless it's really good.

396
00:30:47,038 --> 00:30:48,739
[SPEAKER_03]: Like Street Fighter 2, the movie, the game.

397
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:49,540
[SPEAKER_03]: Just kidding.

398
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:50,160
[SPEAKER_03]: That sucked.

399
00:30:50,420 --> 00:30:51,221
[SPEAKER_02]: I have that in my meme.

400
00:30:51,561 --> 00:30:56,344
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I think I have that somewhere in a box for Saturn.

401
00:30:57,273 --> 00:30:57,713
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry.

402
00:30:57,733 --> 00:30:58,234
[SPEAKER_00]: It's awful.

403
00:30:58,834 --> 00:31:00,476
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we bought it because it was a dollar.

404
00:31:02,498 --> 00:31:07,582
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's go over to ye olde mailbag, and I'm sure we've got plenty of emails.

405
00:31:08,142 --> 00:31:09,664
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura's got to catch us up tonight.

406
00:31:10,544 --> 00:31:14,588
[SPEAKER_03]: If you want to send us an email, 2go at orangeloungeradio.com is the place to send an email.

407
00:31:14,888 --> 00:31:18,111
[SPEAKER_03]: The lovely DarkSakura will read your email and make fun of your grammar.

408
00:31:19,112 --> 00:31:20,093
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I'd do that anyway.

409
00:31:20,113 --> 00:31:22,114
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd do that for free.

410
00:31:22,214 --> 00:31:22,695
[SPEAKER_03]: What do we got?

411
00:31:23,780 --> 00:31:28,383
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, just a couple more articles sent to us by our friend Rob, who is not you.

412
00:31:30,344 --> 00:31:32,366
[SPEAKER_00]: One about the PS3 pricing.

413
00:31:32,426 --> 00:31:34,247
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually read through this article.

414
00:31:34,447 --> 00:31:36,468
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a bit long to cover for the podcast.

415
00:31:37,109 --> 00:31:38,930
[SPEAKER_03]: I briefly read the article.

416
00:31:39,650 --> 00:31:42,712
[SPEAKER_00]: It was on CNN Money, actually.

417
00:31:42,752 --> 00:31:43,833
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think they retracted

418
00:31:44,663 --> 00:31:45,643
[SPEAKER_03]: I think I heard about that.

419
00:31:45,663 --> 00:31:47,124
[SPEAKER_03]: They retracted that a little later.

420
00:31:47,184 --> 00:31:50,685
[SPEAKER_03]: So, don't believe anything you hear and tell like E3.

421
00:31:50,785 --> 00:32:03,510
[SPEAKER_00]: This is fairly recent, but they were talking about with the DVD formats, the different high definition formats being supported by Sony and Microsoft, bringing back sort of like the old Betamax VHS war.

422
00:32:04,851 --> 00:32:05,331
[SPEAKER_00]: Goody, goody.

423
00:32:05,471 --> 00:32:06,911
[SPEAKER_00]: Betamax was better, by the way.

424
00:32:07,492 --> 00:32:08,112
[SPEAKER_00]: Stupid VHS.

425
00:32:10,642 --> 00:32:13,265
[SPEAKER_00]: We actually did sort of have a conversation via email.

426
00:32:13,305 --> 00:32:17,689
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm thinking the price of the Xbox is definitely going to drop after the release of the PS3.

427
00:32:18,269 --> 00:32:18,930
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, it has to.

428
00:32:18,990 --> 00:32:19,851
[SPEAKER_03]: It has to.

429
00:32:20,371 --> 00:32:22,293
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's only with... Microsoft's going to make any money on it.

430
00:32:24,875 --> 00:32:31,902
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, he sent a... Oh, crap, I lost the email.

431
00:32:32,162 --> 00:32:32,902
[SPEAKER_00]: I apologize.

432
00:32:34,204 --> 00:32:34,764
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually...

433
00:32:36,181 --> 00:32:37,621
[SPEAKER_00]: Sega Launches New Operations Arm

434
00:32:59,588 --> 00:33:09,411
[SPEAKER_00]: Sega is back in the amusement game operations business and they plan to grow that part of their empire by building on the purchase of GameWorks, which has now reemerged from bankruptcy protection.

435
00:33:10,331 --> 00:33:13,231
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm very glad to hear someone still gives a shit about the arcades.

436
00:33:13,432 --> 00:33:14,592
[SPEAKER_03]: Honestly, this is great news.

437
00:33:14,612 --> 00:33:16,472
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, Sega's always kicked ass in the arcades.

438
00:33:16,632 --> 00:33:22,934
[SPEAKER_02]: And to touch on the skee-ball thing, the only reason why that game sucks is because your phone doesn't spit out tickets.

439
00:33:25,591 --> 00:33:35,296
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a quote in here saying, The asset purchase of GameWorks, a premier location-based entertainment destination, provides a platform for Sega to lead the amusement and facilities market domestically.

440
00:33:35,636 --> 00:33:36,977
[SPEAKER_00]: They're actually focusing on the U.S.

441
00:33:37,037 --> 00:33:37,337
[SPEAKER_00]: market.

442
00:33:38,638 --> 00:33:38,858
[SPEAKER_03]: Huh.

443
00:33:39,618 --> 00:33:39,938
[SPEAKER_03]: Interesting.

444
00:33:40,159 --> 00:33:47,402
[SPEAKER_00]: Another quote in here, Blending Japanese culture with American creativity has resulted in some of the most compelling, innovative, and popular products in the world.

445
00:33:47,902 --> 00:33:50,704
[SPEAKER_00]: SEUI also has the added advantage of tapping...

446
00:33:51,204 --> 00:33:56,008
[SPEAKER_00]: Sega's manufacturing expertise, all to deliver consumers an unparalleled entertainment experience.

447
00:33:57,649 --> 00:33:58,189
[SPEAKER_00]: What else we got?

448
00:33:59,570 --> 00:34:06,235
[SPEAKER_00]: Also got more email from actually one of our fellow podcasters, Bobby Blackwolf.

449
00:34:06,896 --> 00:34:07,576
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, that guy.

450
00:34:07,776 --> 00:34:08,377
[SPEAKER_03]: He's got a good show.

451
00:34:09,077 --> 00:34:13,200
[SPEAKER_00]: Just talking about... I have to find the email again.

452
00:34:13,220 --> 00:34:13,681
Okay.

453
00:34:15,125 --> 00:34:16,346
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't do it for a couple weeks.

454
00:34:16,366 --> 00:34:18,528
[SPEAKER_03]: You get disorganized.

455
00:34:18,568 --> 00:34:25,333
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I mentioned it on their three-hour show about him listening to our podcast while playing on the Xbox 360.

456
00:34:25,373 --> 00:34:27,975
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought that was pretty cool.

457
00:34:28,235 --> 00:34:32,218
[SPEAKER_00]: You can get your iPod to work through the Xbox 360 while you're playing any game.

458
00:34:32,238 --> 00:34:35,340
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought that was pretty cool.

459
00:34:36,621 --> 00:34:40,404
[SPEAKER_00]: If a game has a crap soundtrack, you can listen to whatever you want to.

460
00:34:43,446 --> 00:34:43,666
[SPEAKER_03]: Awesome.

461
00:34:44,286 --> 00:34:47,167
[SPEAKER_03]: I was going to plug his website, but I suddenly lost the URL.

462
00:34:47,207 --> 00:34:51,228
[SPEAKER_03]: But I know it's in our web link section on our website, OrangeLawnsRadio.com.

463
00:34:51,308 --> 00:34:52,889
[SPEAKER_03]: So check it out.

464
00:34:53,049 --> 00:34:53,969
[SPEAKER_03]: It's cool.

465
00:34:56,690 --> 00:34:57,370
[SPEAKER_03]: Wait, I got it.

466
00:34:57,830 --> 00:34:58,250
[SPEAKER_03]: Here it is.

467
00:34:58,310 --> 00:35:01,291
[SPEAKER_03]: It's allgames.com slash podcast.

468
00:35:01,311 --> 00:35:01,531
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

469
00:35:01,551 --> 00:35:02,772
[SPEAKER_03]: Allgames.com slash podcast.

470
00:35:02,872 --> 00:35:03,812
[SPEAKER_03]: How did you beat me to that?

471
00:35:03,832 --> 00:35:04,792
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I had the email open.

472
00:35:04,832 --> 00:35:05,432
[SPEAKER_03]: You suck.

473
00:35:05,472 --> 00:35:06,793
[SPEAKER_03]: Allgames.com slash podcast.

474
00:35:07,113 --> 00:35:07,413
[SPEAKER_03]: Check it out.

475
00:35:09,056 --> 00:35:10,537
[SPEAKER_03]: He talks about a lot of the same stuff we do.

476
00:35:10,698 --> 00:35:13,941
[SPEAKER_03]: Not that it's the same thing, it's just we have similar interests, so that makes him cool.

477
00:35:14,161 --> 00:35:20,888
[SPEAKER_00]: The very last one, I mentioned this before, RagnarVille, sort of a portal for all free servers for Ragnarok Online.

478
00:35:22,629 --> 00:35:26,313
[SPEAKER_00]: The information is all up on the guy's site.

479
00:35:26,853 --> 00:35:27,714
[SPEAKER_00]: Mark emailed me.

480
00:35:28,235 --> 00:35:31,518
[SPEAKER_00]: So you'd want to go to www.ragnoville.com, check it out.

481
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:35,684
[SPEAKER_03]: Ragnarok 2 Ragnarok 2

482
00:35:48,058 --> 00:35:48,718
[SPEAKER_00]: The little trailer.

483
00:35:48,898 --> 00:35:52,560
[SPEAKER_00]: That will get me totally off World of Warcraft when Ragnarok 2 comes out.

484
00:35:52,700 --> 00:35:54,321
[SPEAKER_03]: I gotta say, Ragnarok 2 looked pretty hot.

485
00:35:55,182 --> 00:35:58,883
[SPEAKER_03]: Gravity doesn't... Maybe they can't do anything because they're overseas.

486
00:35:58,923 --> 00:35:59,184
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

487
00:35:59,204 --> 00:36:00,324
[SPEAKER_03]: That's kind of interesting.

488
00:36:00,604 --> 00:36:06,007
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the thing is that IRO was actually played out of California, actually.

489
00:36:06,247 --> 00:36:06,767
[SPEAKER_03]: Weird.

490
00:36:06,787 --> 00:36:11,270
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I decided to look up their Better Business Bureau stats for a while.

491
00:36:11,590 --> 00:36:13,771
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah, when all that crap was going down.

492
00:36:15,052 --> 00:36:16,433
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe that's why everybody went underground.

493
00:36:16,453 --> 00:36:26,502
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think that there's any, you know, upon further review, I don't think there's any major problem with listing the free servers out there, because it's technically not hosting the servers.

494
00:36:27,242 --> 00:36:27,983
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, yeah.

495
00:36:28,423 --> 00:36:37,211
[SPEAKER_00]: No, and again, though, that could get some of those servers in trouble if they use that, if, you know, whoever the legal one's in charge, use that as their portal to find these people.

496
00:36:38,772 --> 00:36:39,272
[SPEAKER_03]: I understand.

497
00:36:39,292 --> 00:36:43,574
[SPEAKER_03]: The Ragnarok community is a very tight one and a very rabid one, and it's cool.

498
00:36:43,794 --> 00:36:47,856
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's kind of neat, especially when people are trying to mod the game and do different things with it.

499
00:36:48,276 --> 00:36:49,737
[SPEAKER_03]: But just be careful, guys.

500
00:36:49,857 --> 00:36:52,558
[SPEAKER_03]: Just make sure you're in all your checks and balances legally.

501
00:36:52,598 --> 00:36:53,719
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't want to see you get busted.

502
00:36:53,979 --> 00:36:54,399
[SPEAKER_00]: Have fun.

503
00:36:54,559 --> 00:36:54,940
[SPEAKER_00]: Have fun.

504
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:57,561
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure your copy doesn't have that pyrite virus.

505
00:36:57,601 --> 00:36:59,022
[SPEAKER_03]: Send Gravity a dollar.

506
00:36:59,042 --> 00:36:59,602
[SPEAKER_03]: They did write it.

507
00:36:59,862 --> 00:37:00,802
[SPEAKER_03]: Send them a dollar, at least.

508
00:37:02,003 --> 00:37:02,263
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

509
00:37:03,084 --> 00:37:03,724
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's it for email.

510
00:37:04,304 --> 00:37:05,025
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's a free mail.

511
00:37:05,045 --> 00:37:07,527
[SPEAKER_03]: To go at OrangeLoungeRadio.com if you want to send us some more.

512
00:37:07,567 --> 00:37:08,587
[SPEAKER_03]: We love getting email.

513
00:37:10,289 --> 00:37:17,814
[SPEAKER_03]: I wanted to mention real quickly about Suikoden V. They're going to get a special edition Suikoden V in Japan.

514
00:37:17,834 --> 00:37:21,137
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course, they always get special editions in Japan, don't they?

515
00:37:21,177 --> 00:37:23,379
[SPEAKER_03]: This is Konami's kind of answer to the Final Fantasy series.

516
00:37:23,799 --> 00:37:25,020
[SPEAKER_03]: Some people say it's better.

517
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:25,961
[SPEAKER_03]: Who knows?

518
00:37:26,761 --> 00:37:28,162
[SPEAKER_03]: It's really a matter of opinion.

519
00:37:28,823 --> 00:37:32,906
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to come with a 200-page book with character illustrations because, of course...

520
00:37:33,446 --> 00:37:40,889
[SPEAKER_03]: The kind of niche of Suikoden is that you have like 100 different, like what is it, 101 in some games, 108 in others, playable characters.

521
00:37:41,749 --> 00:37:42,970
[SPEAKER_03]: 108, it's 108 stars.

522
00:37:43,010 --> 00:37:44,630
[SPEAKER_03]: I forget, that's like the big catch of Suikoden.

523
00:37:45,110 --> 00:37:53,574
[SPEAKER_03]: They're also going to have an arranged soundtrack, written musical scores, art in the book and everything, fold-out cardboard, art board.

524
00:37:54,234 --> 00:37:56,835
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to be great, so check that out, Suikoden.

525
00:37:57,776 --> 00:37:59,297
[SPEAKER_03]: Will they do the same thing in the US?

526
00:38:00,879 --> 00:38:01,339
[SPEAKER_03]: Probably not.

527
00:38:01,619 --> 00:38:02,280
[SPEAKER_03]: But write Konami.

528
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:02,921
[SPEAKER_03]: Tell them you want it.

529
00:38:03,101 --> 00:38:03,902
[SPEAKER_03]: You never know what might happen.

530
00:38:04,963 --> 00:38:05,984
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki, you got anything else for us?

531
00:38:06,425 --> 00:38:07,285
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I've got a few things.

532
00:38:08,727 --> 00:38:12,211
[SPEAKER_02]: First off, I was going to mention the...

533
00:38:14,497 --> 00:38:21,699
[SPEAKER_02]: Australia is actually getting the Australian Game Developers Conference 2005 Developing Dreams.

534
00:38:22,439 --> 00:38:39,443
[SPEAKER_02]: The 5th edition of the Developers and Publishers Matchmaking Business Convention will take place on December 5th, 6th, and 7th and will be back to some French and basically they're going to have tons of publishers.

535
00:38:39,503 --> 00:38:42,624
[SPEAKER_02]: Sounds like kind of their version of E3 so to speak.

536
00:38:43,224 --> 00:38:43,284
[SPEAKER_02]: Um

537
00:38:44,224 --> 00:38:49,608
[SPEAKER_02]: including all the big names, you know, Nintendo, Sega, Sony, etc.

538
00:38:51,989 --> 00:38:55,171
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm glad they're getting a little love down there in Australia with all that, so that's good.

539
00:38:55,391 --> 00:38:57,172
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope some of our listeners down there get to go to that.

540
00:38:57,613 --> 00:38:58,773
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, should be pretty cool.

541
00:39:00,334 --> 00:39:00,835
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see.

542
00:39:01,475 --> 00:39:09,440
[SPEAKER_02]: Other things, coming out of the woodwork, of course, it looks like Joystick found a patent for their virtual...

543
00:39:11,198 --> 00:39:12,819
[SPEAKER_02]: Emulation for these old systems.

544
00:39:12,859 --> 00:39:18,403
[SPEAKER_02]: And one of the things that was kind of interesting for it is that you select your character before you select your game.

545
00:39:19,884 --> 00:39:22,646
[SPEAKER_02]: That could be very interesting, playing different characters in different games.

546
00:39:22,986 --> 00:39:25,208
[SPEAKER_02]: Running around as Mario in Zelda or something.

547
00:39:25,228 --> 00:39:25,788
[SPEAKER_03]: Who did this?

548
00:39:26,749 --> 00:39:27,850
[SPEAKER_02]: This is actually a patent.

549
00:39:27,890 --> 00:39:30,992
[SPEAKER_02]: Joystick found it on the US Patent Center.

550
00:39:31,012 --> 00:39:31,752
[SPEAKER_03]: Who owns the patent?

551
00:39:32,393 --> 00:39:32,893
[SPEAKER_03]: Nintendo.

552
00:39:33,274 --> 00:39:33,774
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, Nintendo.

553
00:39:33,834 --> 00:39:34,514
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, okay.

554
00:39:34,835 --> 00:39:37,116
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is supposedly what they're going to be using for...

555
00:39:39,198 --> 00:39:39,719
[SPEAKER_02]: The Revolution

556
00:40:02,452 --> 00:40:05,713
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, you have some release dates for some stuff coming up.

557
00:40:05,833 --> 00:40:06,174
[SPEAKER_03]: I sure do.

558
00:40:06,194 --> 00:40:08,195
[SPEAKER_03]: I have our December release dates for the UK.

559
00:40:21,994 --> 00:40:36,766
[SPEAKER_00]: Call of Duty 2, Gun Cameo, Madden NFL, Need for Speed, Miss One, Perfect Dark Zero, King Kong, Project Gotham Racing 3 Psychonauts

560
00:40:39,244 --> 00:40:51,789
[SPEAKER_00]: Ski Racing 2006, Rugby Challenge 2006, Tiger Woods PGA Tour 2006, Tony Hawk's American Wasteland, Frantics, and also Bubble Bobble Revolution for the DS.

561
00:40:51,909 --> 00:40:52,329
[SPEAKER_03]: Cool!

562
00:40:54,109 --> 00:40:54,750
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep, and Amps 3.

563
00:40:55,490 --> 00:40:57,231
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't even heard of Bubble Bobble Revolution.

564
00:40:57,291 --> 00:40:58,771
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that something we're getting here in the U.S.?

565
00:40:58,991 --> 00:40:59,391
[SPEAKER_03]: I think so.

566
00:40:59,631 --> 00:41:00,732
[SPEAKER_03]: Dude, I want that.

567
00:41:01,292 --> 00:41:02,172
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't care if it sucks.

568
00:41:02,232 --> 00:41:03,053
[SPEAKER_03]: It's Bubble Bobble.

569
00:41:04,398 --> 00:41:04,839
[SPEAKER_03]: Final Fantasy 4

570
00:41:19,195 --> 00:41:23,897
[SPEAKER_02]: Animal Crossing Wild Worlds Animal Crossing Wild Worlds is going to be coming out for the DS.

571
00:41:24,117 --> 00:41:28,119
[SPEAKER_02]: You've got Super Mario Strikers for those people that like those Mario sports games.

572
00:41:28,139 --> 00:41:30,240
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see what else.

573
00:41:30,900 --> 00:41:34,201
[SPEAKER_02]: You've also got a bunch of PSP games, actually.

574
00:41:34,221 --> 00:41:38,603
[SPEAKER_02]: You've got WWE vs. SmackDown 06 coming out for the PSP.

575
00:41:39,003 --> 00:41:43,245
[SPEAKER_02]: As well, of course, Dead or Alive 4 is coming out for the 360, which will be really good.

576
00:41:43,725 --> 00:41:44,926
[SPEAKER_02]: And then some more...

577
00:41:46,511 --> 00:41:50,612
[SPEAKER_02]: There's actually another game coming out on December 14th, Darwinia.

578
00:41:50,652 --> 00:41:53,633
[SPEAKER_02]: It will be available for download for $19.95.

579
00:41:53,673 --> 00:41:54,353
[SPEAKER_02]: Is this US or UK or both?

580
00:42:09,520 --> 00:42:13,182
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, it says 1995 in dollars, so I'm assuming it's American.

581
00:42:13,222 --> 00:42:13,582
[SPEAKER_00]: Very cool.

582
00:42:14,563 --> 00:42:20,025
[SPEAKER_00]: They are actually saying, though, that soon after it's released, there will be a multiplayer version on the way.

583
00:42:21,266 --> 00:42:22,347
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, what is Darwinny all about?

584
00:42:22,367 --> 00:42:23,627
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I'm not very familiar with this one.

585
00:42:23,827 --> 00:42:27,829
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't have too much time to look into it, but I think it's more of a virtual universe.

586
00:42:28,590 --> 00:42:32,452
[SPEAKER_03]: One of our listeners emailed me on this.

587
00:42:32,472 --> 00:42:32,892
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember this.

588
00:42:32,912 --> 00:42:33,312
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember this.

589
00:42:33,352 --> 00:42:33,992
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, great.

590
00:42:34,373 --> 00:42:34,633
[SPEAKER_03]: Cool.

591
00:42:35,693 --> 00:42:36,033
[SPEAKER_03]: Sounds good.

592
00:42:36,053 --> 00:42:36,874
[SPEAKER_03]: What's the website for that?

593
00:42:36,994 --> 00:42:37,294
[SPEAKER_03]: Do we know?

594
00:42:37,594 --> 00:42:38,575
[SPEAKER_03]: I just closed it.

595
00:42:38,595 --> 00:42:38,735
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry.

596
00:42:39,415 --> 00:42:42,197
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, I think the company that makes it is called Steam.

597
00:42:43,537 --> 00:42:44,898
[SPEAKER_00]: Or just Google it.

598
00:42:44,998 --> 00:42:45,598
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure it'll come up.

599
00:42:45,638 --> 00:42:46,159
[SPEAKER_00]: Darwinia.

600
00:42:47,219 --> 00:42:49,461
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki, I noticed you have this up on the screen right now.

601
00:42:49,501 --> 00:42:50,781
[SPEAKER_03]: This is kind of PSP related.

602
00:42:50,961 --> 00:42:52,022
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm really curious about this.

603
00:42:52,082 --> 00:42:53,923
[SPEAKER_03]: Is this the Namco Volume 2 collection?

604
00:42:53,943 --> 00:42:57,565
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep, Namco Battle Collection Volume 2, which has been announced.

605
00:42:57,585 --> 00:43:01,627
[SPEAKER_02]: It has 11 original games and 2 arranged games.

606
00:43:02,668 --> 00:43:06,830
[SPEAKER_02]: And basically, the list of games, we've got King and Balloon.

607
00:43:07,911 --> 00:43:10,913
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, Boskania, or Boskanian or whatever.

608
00:43:11,273 --> 00:43:11,853
[SPEAKER_02]: Bosconian.

609
00:43:11,973 --> 00:43:12,614
[SPEAKER_02]: Bosconian.

610
00:43:12,754 --> 00:43:13,134
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go.

611
00:43:13,174 --> 00:43:13,694
[SPEAKER_02]: Not a mistake.

612
00:43:14,134 --> 00:43:18,957
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, Xevious, uh, Mappy, The Tower of Yraga.

613
00:43:18,977 --> 00:43:21,578
[SPEAKER_03]: How many fucking times do we need to see Mappy though?

614
00:43:21,638 --> 00:43:25,240
[SPEAKER_03]: Seriously, I mean Mappy's been in every Namco collection since the dawn of time.

615
00:43:25,300 --> 00:43:25,921
[SPEAKER_03]: They need to do Mappy Land.

616
00:43:26,601 --> 00:43:30,323
[SPEAKER_03]: I do, Mappy's cool and all, but seriously, I'm done with Mappy.

617
00:43:31,083 --> 00:43:32,644
[SPEAKER_00]: There's one game I'm disappointed that's not in there.

618
00:43:32,664 --> 00:43:32,964
[SPEAKER_00]: What's that?

619
00:43:33,165 --> 00:43:33,865
[SPEAKER_00]: Legend of Valkyrie.

620
00:43:35,180 --> 00:43:41,906
[SPEAKER_02]: Grubda, Dragon Buster, Dig Dug 2, Modos, Rolling Thunder, Dragon Spirit, Pac-Man Arrangement Plus Pac-Man and Modos Arrangement Why would they arrange Modos?

621
00:43:41,926 --> 00:43:42,946
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there a Modos fan club I'm unaware of?

622
00:44:05,010 --> 00:44:13,154
[SPEAKER_02]: But anyways, it's slated for the Japanese market in February 23rd, 2006.

623
00:44:13,774 --> 00:44:24,199
[SPEAKER_02]: It's actually going to be priced at only 3,990 yen, and a lot cheaper than the original game, which was 5,040 yen.

624
00:44:24,499 --> 00:44:30,502
[SPEAKER_02]: And the Japanese release is not yet scheduled, but probably will be soon after.

625
00:44:30,582 --> 00:44:31,402
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm sure we'll get it.

626
00:44:32,309 --> 00:44:32,909
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure we will

627
00:44:55,526 --> 00:44:57,067
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for watching.

628
00:44:57,087 --> 00:44:58,448
[SPEAKER_03]: See you next time.

629
00:45:17,639 --> 00:45:26,041
[SPEAKER_03]: This is interesting because Guitar Hero is actually going to be featured on MTV, which shouldn't be too much of a surprise because you see the MTV logo when you boot up the game.

630
00:45:26,421 --> 00:45:35,862
[SPEAKER_03]: However, they're going to really be whoring out Guitar Hero on MTV on the cable, including MTV, MTV2, the MTV University channel, and MTV.com.

631
00:45:36,282 --> 00:45:39,523
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a partnership between MTV Games and Red Octane.

632
00:45:40,723 --> 00:45:45,024
[SPEAKER_03]: For the first time, rock music is not in the background, but instead it is the game.

633
00:45:46,325 --> 00:45:48,287
[SPEAKER_03]: Quote there from CEO Red Octane.

634
00:45:48,427 --> 00:45:50,268
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you know who their other partnership is with, right?

635
00:45:50,508 --> 00:45:51,069
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, Harmonix.

636
00:45:51,089 --> 00:45:51,790
[SPEAKER_00]: Gibson Guitars.

637
00:45:51,950 --> 00:45:52,450
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, that too.

638
00:45:52,890 --> 00:45:54,552
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

639
00:45:55,313 --> 00:46:02,179
[SPEAKER_00]: Because if you actually look through your unlocks, every guitar in that game is a Gibson guitar down to their classics.

640
00:46:03,636 --> 00:46:06,338
[SPEAKER_03]: Speaking of MTV, I find this very interesting.

641
00:46:06,418 --> 00:46:09,841
[SPEAKER_03]: They are really pushing to get more game-oriented content recently.

642
00:46:09,921 --> 00:46:14,765
[SPEAKER_03]: Not only did they pick this up, but they bought GameTrailers.com.

643
00:46:15,066 --> 00:46:20,590
[SPEAKER_03]: They have assimilated it into its MTV cube or whatever you want to call it.

644
00:46:20,670 --> 00:46:22,091
[SPEAKER_03]: It's interesting.

645
00:46:22,212 --> 00:46:23,733
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice, it'll load even slower now.

646
00:46:26,289 --> 00:46:27,989
[SPEAKER_00]: It's uniqueness will join the collective.

647
00:46:29,030 --> 00:46:29,350
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

648
00:46:30,870 --> 00:46:39,332
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course, you can't play video games all day long because if you played video games all day long, you'd have no time to go out and live a rock and roll lifestyle.

649
00:46:39,712 --> 00:46:51,195
[SPEAKER_03]: So to remind you that there is a world out there outside of video games, DarkSakura is here to present you her advice column, some life tips to just remind you that there's a whole world out there.

650
00:46:51,255 --> 00:46:51,855
[SPEAKER_03]: Go explore it.

651
00:46:51,915 --> 00:46:53,616
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, what are you giving us tips on tonight?

652
00:46:53,996 --> 00:46:56,017
[SPEAKER_00]: Today's tip is how to ram the barricade.

653
00:46:56,717 --> 00:46:58,518
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, like if you're running away from the cops or something?

654
00:46:58,979 --> 00:46:59,319
[SPEAKER_03]: Sort of.

655
00:46:59,339 --> 00:46:59,659
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, cool.

656
00:46:59,679 --> 00:47:01,180
[SPEAKER_00]: Or if you're trying to break into somebody's yard.

657
00:47:01,280 --> 00:47:01,800
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, okay, cool.

658
00:47:02,420 --> 00:47:05,382
[SPEAKER_00]: Number one, identify the barricade's weakest point.

659
00:47:05,742 --> 00:47:12,666
[SPEAKER_00]: The side of the barricade or gate that opens or the place where a lock holds it closed is usually the most vulnerable spot.

660
00:47:13,506 --> 00:47:15,347
[SPEAKER_00]: Number two, aim for the weak spot.

661
00:47:15,827 --> 00:47:19,009
[SPEAKER_00]: If possible, use the rear of your car to ram the weak spot in the barricade.

662
00:47:19,449 --> 00:47:22,331
[SPEAKER_00]: Ramming the front end may damage the engine and cause the car to stall.

663
00:47:30,095 --> 00:47:32,596
[SPEAKER_00]: 3.

664
00:47:30,255 --> 00:47:32,596
[SPEAKER_00]: Accelerate to a speed of 30-45 mph.

665
00:47:33,156 --> 00:47:36,957
[SPEAKER_00]: Jug just before impact if you are heading toward an extremely tall barricade or fence.

666
00:47:37,377 --> 00:47:40,719
[SPEAKER_00]: Pieces of the barricade may come through your window, or the window may shatter.

667
00:47:41,519 --> 00:47:49,442
[SPEAKER_00]: But my final piece of advice, don't try to go ram your way into the Neverland Ranch because Michael Jackson is so not worth it.

668
00:47:54,301 --> 00:47:55,822
[SPEAKER_03]: Womp, womp, womp, Loki!

669
00:47:56,323 --> 00:47:58,724
[SPEAKER_03]: Any closing stories for us tonight, because we're about ready to wrap it up?

670
00:47:59,205 --> 00:47:59,865
[SPEAKER_02]: A few things.

671
00:48:00,045 --> 00:48:02,967
[SPEAKER_02]: Unfortunately, Australia will not be seeing the 360 until March 2nd.

672
00:48:03,008 --> 00:48:04,489
[SPEAKER_02]: Hopefully then they won't overheat.

673
00:48:05,649 --> 00:48:13,435
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, honestly, Australia, I know you're pissed about this, but maybe the consoles will be a little more fine-tuned by the time you get them.

674
00:48:14,236 --> 00:48:18,339
[SPEAKER_02]: If you need a reason why they hate Best Buy even more, apparently it's been...

675
00:48:19,122 --> 00:48:29,541
[SPEAKER_02]: Shown that on numerous occasions, and this is not surprising one bit, they've been lying about how many Xboxes they're getting and employees have been pocketing them and selling them on eBay.

676
00:48:30,795 --> 00:48:31,536
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, snap.

677
00:48:31,596 --> 00:48:32,397
[SPEAKER_03]: That is dirty.

678
00:48:32,577 --> 00:48:33,978
[SPEAKER_03]: That is dirty.

679
00:48:33,998 --> 00:48:42,424
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought it was pretty... I understand the need to get the game systems to your employees as well, but I always thought it was kind of shady when too many of them are going to the employees.

680
00:48:42,444 --> 00:48:51,692
[SPEAKER_03]: You really got to... If there's somebody working for you that just comes in on the weekends, do they really get that same priority that maybe the manager of the store has?

681
00:48:51,892 --> 00:48:52,252
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

682
00:48:52,672 --> 00:48:53,473
[SPEAKER_03]: Kind of interesting.

683
00:48:53,813 --> 00:48:54,214
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

684
00:48:54,774 --> 00:48:57,516
[SPEAKER_02]: I did happen to actually see some of the faceplates that they have for the 360.

685
00:48:57,556 --> 00:48:57,636
[SPEAKER_02]: Ugly.

686
00:49:00,319 --> 00:49:01,600
[SPEAKER_02]: That's all I gotta say.

687
00:49:01,960 --> 00:49:05,381
[SPEAKER_02]: Should not be spending the extra money on faceplates.

688
00:49:05,441 --> 00:49:07,803
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, there were some cool ones we talked about on a previous podcast.

689
00:49:07,823 --> 00:49:09,323
[SPEAKER_03]: Like if you're a Star Wars fan and all that.

690
00:49:09,543 --> 00:49:10,964
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember that from a previous show.

691
00:49:10,984 --> 00:49:11,364
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, okay.

692
00:49:11,404 --> 00:49:12,605
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it comes down to this, folks.

693
00:49:12,685 --> 00:49:16,107
[SPEAKER_02]: If you really want a different faceplate, there are websites out there.

694
00:49:16,167 --> 00:49:19,628
[SPEAKER_02]: I believe Xbox 360 skins or something like that.

695
00:49:20,209 --> 00:49:22,390
[SPEAKER_02]: You can actually design your own.

696
00:49:22,990 --> 00:49:23,970
[SPEAKER_02]: Have it the way you want it.

697
00:49:24,231 --> 00:49:25,911
[SPEAKER_02]: They have some really cool ones on that site.

698
00:49:26,031 --> 00:49:27,032
[SPEAKER_03]: Make an Orange Lounge Radio one.

699
00:49:27,743 --> 00:49:30,645
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought about doing that and don't get ahead of me now.

700
00:49:32,126 --> 00:49:42,614
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the things I thought was pretty cool that they were showing is the development team for the Xbox 360 have gotten their own special edition version of the Xbox, which is pretty badass.

701
00:49:42,634 --> 00:49:48,898
[SPEAKER_02]: They've got concept art as well as just some different green highlights on the controller.

702
00:49:49,479 --> 00:49:50,019
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a neat one.

703
00:49:50,219 --> 00:49:51,820
[SPEAKER_02]: Which is pretty cool, I think.

704
00:49:52,161 --> 00:49:54,462
[SPEAKER_02]: So I wonder how long before we see that on eBay.

705
00:49:54,963 --> 00:49:55,303
[SPEAKER_02]: And then...

706
00:49:56,933 --> 00:50:00,156
[SPEAKER_02]: My favorite thing, which I was just checking this out.

707
00:50:01,297 --> 00:50:07,802
[SPEAKER_02]: Basically, they're going to say that Animal Crossing DS is going to be an extremely well-selling game.

708
00:50:08,123 --> 00:50:11,125
[SPEAKER_02]: They're saying it might actually outsell Nintendogs.

709
00:50:12,146 --> 00:50:19,632
[SPEAKER_02]: And so far, they've indicated that they've pre-sold 300,000 units, which beats out Nintendogs by almost double.

710
00:50:19,692 --> 00:50:19,993
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

711
00:50:20,928 --> 00:50:28,371
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, Mario Kart DS also, and I don't think this came up in any other story, but Mario Kart had a great first week.

712
00:50:28,431 --> 00:50:37,815
[SPEAKER_03]: They say that like 41% of people that own Mario Kart DS went online with it in the first week as compared to 18% went online with Halo 2.

713
00:50:38,275 --> 00:50:41,536
[SPEAKER_02]: And speaking of Nintendogs, they've already sold 1 million in Europe.

714
00:50:42,546 --> 00:50:43,086
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow!

715
00:50:43,606 --> 00:50:44,467
[SPEAKER_02]: One million copies.

716
00:50:44,487 --> 00:50:46,388
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't fed my puppies in a month.

717
00:50:46,768 --> 00:50:47,228
[SPEAKER_03]: Me neither.

718
00:50:47,288 --> 00:50:48,408
[SPEAKER_03]: My doggies are long dead.

719
00:50:48,569 --> 00:50:50,029
[SPEAKER_02]: I am so done with that game.

720
00:50:50,569 --> 00:50:55,632
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the game everybody should check out, which is coming out this week, Mario and Luigi Partners in Time.

721
00:50:56,272 --> 00:50:59,173
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, that's kind of the... Mario and Luigi Super Saga 2.

722
00:50:59,613 --> 00:51:00,454
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's cool.

723
00:51:01,434 --> 00:51:02,054
[SPEAKER_03]: That game was fun.

724
00:51:02,154 --> 00:51:02,634
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a good time.

725
00:51:03,255 --> 00:51:06,256
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe if I can take a break from playing Dragon Quest, I'll check that out.

726
00:51:07,617 --> 00:51:10,598
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, one last story for you guys tonight, and then we'll wrap it up.

727
00:51:12,119 --> 00:51:26,048
[SPEAKER_03]: A study by the Entertainment Software Association says that 31% of Americans plan to engage in a game exchange this year, meaning that somebody's got a game on their Christmas list.

728
00:51:26,568 --> 00:51:29,110
[SPEAKER_03]: So it might not just be the hardcore gamers out there.

729
00:51:29,150 --> 00:51:32,133
[SPEAKER_03]: It sounds like a lot of people out there want to get their hands on a game.

730
00:51:32,854 --> 00:51:39,139
[SPEAKER_03]: They're saying 49% of homes with children aged 12 to 17 will give or get a game this year.

731
00:51:40,961 --> 00:51:49,188
[SPEAKER_03]: Only 43% when we're talking kids under 12, and 22% in a home without children, which I think is still a pretty big number there, so...

732
00:51:50,015 --> 00:51:55,902
[SPEAKER_03]: Gaming is definitely making a bigger and bigger step in our culture here.

733
00:51:56,282 --> 00:51:58,284
[SPEAKER_03]: And finally... No, I had the last say.

734
00:51:58,324 --> 00:51:58,625
[SPEAKER_02]: No!

735
00:51:59,145 --> 00:51:59,546
[SPEAKER_02]: Fine.

736
00:52:00,006 --> 00:52:00,467
[SPEAKER_02]: One last one.

737
00:52:00,487 --> 00:52:01,027
[SPEAKER_02]: God damn it.

738
00:52:01,828 --> 00:52:02,949
[SPEAKER_02]: Listen, I'm done.

739
00:52:02,969 --> 00:52:03,350
[SPEAKER_02]: This is it.

740
00:52:03,430 --> 00:52:04,411
[SPEAKER_02]: The last one.

741
00:52:04,491 --> 00:52:09,837
[SPEAKER_02]: Family Media Guide has released their list of the 10 most ultra-violent video games.

742
00:52:10,317 --> 00:52:12,518
[SPEAKER_02]: that you would want not to buy.

743
00:52:12,918 --> 00:52:16,200
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, in other words, these are the ten games on my Christmas list.

744
00:52:16,440 --> 00:52:17,060
[SPEAKER_02]: Go for it.

745
00:52:17,401 --> 00:52:30,047
[SPEAKER_02]: Resident Evil 4, Grand Theft Auto San Andreas, God of War, NARC, Killer7, The Warriors, 50 Cent and Bulletproof, Crime Life Gang Wars, Condemned Criminal Origins, and True Crime New York City, most of which I own.

746
00:52:32,008 --> 00:52:34,769
[SPEAKER_00]: So why is there a picture of a clockwork orange on there?

747
00:52:35,103 --> 00:52:36,143
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, your final thought

748
00:53:02,364 --> 00:53:05,245
[SPEAKER_00]: Hack, hack, cough, cough, reject false icons.

749
00:53:05,865 --> 00:53:09,225
[SPEAKER_03]: That's going to do it for another week of Orange Lounge Radio To Go.

750
00:53:09,425 --> 00:53:10,426
