249930	255053	On tonight's program of Orange Lounge Radio... Rob, the fuck's up?
255093	255454	Shut up.
255654	258215	I just... This microphone is so weird, I can't stand it.
258275	263178	Anyway... Anyway... This microphone is heavy and I can club baby seals with it.
264735	266137	Can I do the introduction, please?
266157	266658	Oh, okay.
267098	269161	This should be a clue of what to expect on tonight's program.
269501	273927	On tonight's program, we are going to make sweet, sweet love to Red Octane and Harmonix.
276931	278113	And we're not even going to charge them.
279835	280776	We'll be back after this.
292943	298362	Orange Lounge Radio is presented in the TMI sound format.
326554	332617	You're listening to Orange Lounge Radio Live.
332637	337780	This morning's talk radio is so much more.
340581	341482	Oh, God.
343083	343883	Call me Daddy.

363825	364705	Just kidding.
364805	368527	Orange Lounge Radio will not contain any of that in this episode.
368607	370488	Well, isn't that special?
375024	393555	Orange Lounge Radio Live is a fully interactive program via our website at www.orangeloungeradio.com And now, here are your hosts for Orange Lounge Radio Live, DarkSakura, Sky, and Loki.
395296	399559	We are live!
400774	407615	This is episode number 163 for this November the 6th of 2005.
408075	419878	You're tuned in to Orange Lounge Radio, radio that gamers really want, and this is Orange Lounge Radio Live, your home for all the news and discussion on rhythm and music games, as well as the gamer community and the pop culture world.
420278	425299	We're plugged in and fully interactive through our website at www.orangeloungeradio.com.
427159	429120	My name is Rob Roberts, you might know me as Sky.
429401	431522	Joining me, as always, are my awesome co-hosts.
431722	435685	In this corner, the happiest bunny on the farm, Miss DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.
436705	437025	Yo.
437526	438006	How you doing?
439107	440167	This microphone is heavy.
442209	443730	I also drink the blood of young virgins.
444650	444991	Hot.
445751	446992	I'm having it for dinner right now.
447012	447892	It's salad dressing.
448933	449233	Awesome.
449854	453056	At least that's what I think that they use in their salad dressings at McDonald's.
453076	454577	It has to be something that tastes fairly...
455546	459550	We may have to switch mics, because for some reason that one's not picking you up so well.
460471	461512	Let's do this.
461752	464895	Just make sure when you're talking, the little switch is out this way, otherwise it won't pick you up.
467678	469860	This is my microphone.
470200	472162	I know, but I switched it because we had trouble.
472182	473644	Don't change things on me!
474244	475385	It makes me anxious.
476386	478488	And when I get anxious, people die.
479029	479850	They're all going to get you.
480905	481245	Huh?
508627	508727	Oh.
509087	509548	Hi, Loki.
509568	511189	Thank you for joining our program tonight.
511229	512149	We appreciate it.
513270	513650	Thank you.
514251	514831	Glad to be here.
515592	517213	Fucking RARC work!
519754	521415	Something is wrong with my microphone.
521435	523096	Like, I'm not as loud as I usually am.
523897	524377	Thank God.
525538	526679	Check, check, check, check.
526719	527219	There we go.
527379	527759	There we go.
527899	528540	Now I can hear myself.
531055	532196	This internet sucks.
532696	533176	It really does.
533276	533577	All right.
533917	538660	Anyway, now that we've got our sound issues worked out, we can actually have ourselves a little bit of a show tonight.
539360	542863	I know I want to talk a lot about Guitar Hero because it's really cool.
544054	546536	and we're also going to talk about, of course, our weeks and our day.
546936	554460	We're going to talk about a cool interview that we're going to have on tonight's podcast and then we're going to talk about whatever tickles our fancy.
554700	556241	And then we're going to set a guitar on fire.
556781	557362	We just might.
557762	561584	But first, say hello to our special guests because it wouldn't be a show if we didn't have some special guests.
562064	563185	Say hello to Bugged.
564746	565306	Hello to Bugged.
565966	567707	And also say hello to DDR Angel.
568228	568608	Hello.
569148	570329	My salad just exploded.
571516	572296	That sounds hot.
573997	574637	You don't want to know.
577018	579878	Alright, and Xtifer's around as well.
579938	582739	He might pop in a little later in the show, hopefully to give us a movie review.
582859	584000	He's fondling his new Mac.
584100	586520	Yes, he's making sweet love to his new Macintosh.
586540	591462	And I'm going to get one soon, too.
592222	593202	Another.
593402	593682	Another.
594463	594743	Alright.
595543	599324	We'll be back after this quick introduction to talk about us.
600319	601919	and what's going on in the video game world.
601939	602499	We'll be back.
603260	608321	I figured we could maybe continue the theme of the pre-show tonight because the pre-show tonight was a lot of disco music.
608741	610881	So we're going to continue on and get down.
611561	615242	I just needed to culture everybody because the Saturday Night Fever soundtrack is fabulous.
615502	616242	It is great.
616342	618122	So let's get down right now.
618142	618702	More Bee Gees.
618763	619423	More Cowbell.
620083	620983	More Orange Lounge Radio.
621003	621823	We'll be back after this.

988730	991512	I'm looking in the index, but I don't see anything.
991752	992653	How to run a radio show.
992753	993234	Hello?
993894	995355	I don't understand this.
995936	996737	Does this thing work?
996757	998358	This thing reads like stereo instructions.
998418	999019	Is this on?
999039	999639	What the hell?
1002181	1003603	Orange Lounge Radio.
1003783	1005845	Broke Down Ghetto Bomani Radio.
1007369	1017532	Hi kids, we're back here on Orange Lounge Radio, and I know we've been having some mic problems tonight or something, so we tried fixing it a little bit during the break, so I hope that our mic quality is a little better now.
1018072	1019932	But if not, you'll just have to deal with it, I guess.
1020292	1020612	I don't know.
1020892	1022213	We tried to patch some things up.
1022353	1023813	We kicked Mike out and replaced him.
1024233	1024653	Yeah, that's right.
1024673	1025013	We fired.
1025033	1025433	FIRED!
1026714	1028714	So hopefully things are a little better now.
1029654	1032615	We would like you to know that those responsible have just been sacked.
1033175	1035396	And those who did the sacking have also been sacked.
1036661	1037222	At Infinium.
1037583	1040148	As suddenly a giant foot comes crashing down on our program.
1040228	1043535	We will now continue the rest of this program in a flashy manner and at great expense.
1045018	1045780	I hate you guys.
1046461	1046721	Anyway.
1048271	1049331	That's why they haven't kicked us out, right?
1049472	1050312	Yeah.
1050432	1056475	Moving on, I want to get into this real quickly because we were talking about this a little bit during the break before we get into a little bit of How's Your Week, How's Your Day.
1056775	1061657	But Loki's randomly surfing the internet as he does when he's on this program because he doesn't really like to participate in the program.
1062037	1064758	He just surfs the internet randomly and giggles once in a while in the corner.
1065278	1068079	So, Loki, what was this article you found about the AOL guy?
1069140	1070400	You found an article about the AOL guy?
1070841	1076303	Yeah, the AOL guy is now, he's basically selling himself to make,
1076966	1080148	You know, custom WAV files for your email programs or what have you.
1080789	1087733	Um, and he's charging, I believe, was it like $12 for, um, per WAV file or something like that.
1088394	1088934	Let me see here.
1088954	1089575	I can't remember.
1089595	1090996	He's already sold himself to the devil.
1091036	1092637	He may as well sell himself to everybody else.
1093417	1096179	Um, he was... Can you get him to say anything?
1096659	1098120	Well, I have no idea.
1098220	1103044	Like, could I make him record a WAV file and send it to my ex that goes, You've got herpes!
1105070	1114195	It says, let's see here, yeah, one WAV file, it would be $12 for a non-AOL file, $30 for five files, so that's a little break there.
1114816	1125263	It says, basically, it doesn't really say what else he'll do, just pretty much whatever, I guess, you want.
1126724	1128144	Is there a limit to the number of words he'll say?
1130814	1136456	I don't know, it doesn't say, um, so, I guess if you're gonna order... I don't mind if I'm singing, I'm a little teapot.
1139777	1141918	I'm a little teapot, shorthand stout.
1142878	1144839	You've got mail, you've got hot tea.
1146720	1147000	Anyway.
1148080	1155323	I think he'll do, like, you've got mail and stuff, like, he'll do, like, um, you know, you've got mail, Bob, or you've got mail...
1156912	1157753	You've got served.
1179736	1181738	EXERCIEXECON or something.
1181878	1186062	You just make it up and when he doesn't say it right, you go, no you bastard, that's not my name.
1186382	1189485	Emphasis on the X. Some ancient Egyptian name.
1190586	1193269	Or like my... Awesome.
1193789	1195111	So, yeah.
1195131	1197573	Make him pronounce something in Welsh, he'll totally screw it up.
1198574	1199475	In a foreign language.
1199495	1203759	Can you imagine what it must be like as him, you know, it's just...
1204650	1206250	It's just really bad stuff.
1206310	1209071	I mean, you know, he's all making love to his wife.
1209431	1209991	Oh, yeah.
1210872	1211772	Just really weird.
1212192	1213232	He's got a weird voice.
1213412	1214312	I'm saying that.
1214432	1216113	I only get hot when you say it.
1216213	1217613	You've got mail.
1219054	1227796	It's like, remember, it was Carlos, not Carlos Mencia, but Paulo Francisco and the movie guy, the movie voice guy, and him, you know.
1227816	1230136	Oh, yeah, that's an old, yeah.
1230156	1230816	The passion.
1232057	1232277	Anyways.
1233254	1233574	DarkSakura
1250905	1252786	I'm not even a well-put-together basket.
1252906	1256528	It was sort of like a mildewed basket like you find in the thrift store.
1258028	1258209	Ew.
1258669	1260089	Yeah.
1261210	1264151	I went to the doctor Tuesday with a migraine.
1265572	1267953	And so now I found out that my brain might be broken.
1268934	1270895	So I get to go in for a CT scan on Monday.
1273036	1273536	Fun, huh?
1276517	1277518	I don't want to make a joke.
1278482	1281344	But I have to say this, it's not the tumor.
1281844	1285047	I've been doing, I eat, you, I eat fat in the car.
1286067	1289009	The only time my headache wasn't present was when I was really drunk.
1290471	1292732	I don't want to come across as insensitive to the listeners, so.
1293313	1295374	I have the diagnosis.
1296195	1298736	You're allergic to sobriety.
1300718	1302319	That's probably it.
1303059	1303960	I know, I'm so smart.
1304340	1305401	That'll be $50, please.
1306942	1307422	Guess what?
1307703	1308023	Bite me.
1309025	1317208	Biller Insurance I'll tell you, Bill, that I can't say it on the air.
1318388	1319789	I played Guitar Hero and lots of it.
1320509	1322390	You're going to have to drink the thing that tastes like chalk?
1324131	1324711	I don't know.
1325351	1327332	Because they're testing my brain.
1328292	1328852	It'll be fine.
1328872	1329433	You'll be fine.
1329553	1330653	I have a headache right now, too.
1330813	1335655	I have the same headache that I have had since Friday the week before.
1337358	1341040	So, I'm not very happy, and they put me on stuff for migraines.
1341560	1347482	They should put a couple pills underneath her head, so, you know, this is your brain, this is your brain on drugs.
1348543	1348883	Hehe.
1350044	1351524	This doesn't even make sense.
1352084	1357007	Her brain is on drugs, therefore when she's getting whatever, you know, cat scan or whatever.
1357027	1359548	Oh, okay, I got it, the egg, okay.
1359888	1362269	I have a magnet that says, this is your brain.
1364292	1367174	and then this is your brain with a piece of toast and bacon.
1370697	1374780	I haven't gotten, you know, a little known fact, I actually collect fridge magnets.
1375791	1376031	Magnet House
1401508	1402969	I love that store.
1403109	1403870	It's awesome.
1404110	1404931	Magnets are cool.
1405371	1406732	The bumper stickers of my fridge.
1406752	1407933	Back to my broken brain.
1409955	1410175	Oh, sorry.
1410195	1410435	Oh, sorry.
1410575	1414618	I think that our listeners are probably very amused that they found out what I was actually on.
1414839	1415899	They keep saying Vicodin.
1416360	1417220	I'm not on Vicodin.
1417280	1420223	I'm on something else that I'm not going to tell you what I'm on.
1420523	1421244	But they would laugh.
1422504	1425187	Because it's the last thing anyone ever expected me to be taken.
1425847	1426608	Like Prozac?
1426648	1426908	Actually.
1428882	1429242	I don't know.
1429422	1429803	I don't know.
1430083	1432464	It's actually called triple whiskey shots.
1432984	1433344	Awesome.
1435425	1438386	At least I wish that they had triple whiskey shots in the pill so you don't get the burn.
1438446	1439767	You just take the whiskey pill.
1441327	1441647	Okay.
1442288	1448930	Well, I hope you go to the doctor and everything is okay and they just find that they need to let the hamster out or something.
1449050	1449370	I don't know.
1450351	1452992	Dude, if they gave me morphine, I'd be freaking happy.
1454212	1454492	All right.
1454653	1456533	Anything else you want to share about your week and your day?
1456753	1457554	I need a new job.
1458726	1460509	Okay, now hiring.
1461711	1463113	Loki, how was your week?
1463133	1463594	How was your day?
1465597	1466920	My week was pretty good.
1469163	1471447	The entire week was basically filled with...
1472765	1496413	Work and playing deathmatches in Grand Theft Auto Liberty City Stories, because my boss loves Grand Theft Auto, and so now, instead of taking a 15 minute break and playing something, we go down into the theater and play a four player multiplayer deathmatch on Grand Theft Auto Liberty City Stories and take a half an hour break, and it's okay because the boss is there too, so, hell yeah.
1497093	1497954	Do that twice a day.
1498414	1498554	So,
1499688	1500348	That's pretty fun.
1502109	1516152	As promised, I have made sure to participate in the Biggest Loser thing, and I'm happy to say that I have eaten fast food every single day this week to meet my Quora.
1517352	1521373	And yeah, other than that, really not too much else.
1521513	1522813	You've got heart problems!
1523633	1524614	I'm fine.
1525514	1525814	Shit.
1527642	1529083	I went and saw Saw 2 last night.
1529663	1531224	I have to say, though, I was quite disappointed.
1531264	1532805	It wasn't as gory as I thought it would be.
1534226	1535226	It really was a letdown.
1536407	1538048	I mean, I don't know what everyone is saying.
1538128	1541630	I was expecting, like, you know, fountains of blood.
1541670	1547033	There is not even nearly enough blood in that, or gore, or anything.
1548094	1550875	So, they really are going to have to impress me with Saw 3.
1551456	1552977	And you know there's going to be a Saw 3.
1553297	1553757	Oh, yeah.
1553957	1555358	Stupid bitch.
1555728	1562490	They shouldn't have given the main guy cancer or it should have been cancer who doesn't progress that fast or something like that, you know, magic cancer or something.
1563290	1563650	I don't know.
1564050	1567131	Try not to give away all the plot points of the movie in case some folks want to see it.
1567851	1569111	He has cancer!
1569671	1571052	Cancer!
1571072	1572652	Yeah, whatever.
1574973	1576113	Alright, anything else you want to share?
1579774	1581134	No, really, no.
1581754	1582054	Okay.
1583134	1585275	Alright, Angel, how was your week, how was your day?
1587007	1587267	Good.
1588868	1589208	Hang on.
1592029	1593749	Chew the salad and swallow it.
1594189	1595069	I mean, I'm just kidding.
1595569	1596730	I'm very proud of Angel today.
1597870	1598110	What?
1598690	1599491	For eating a salad.
1599751	1601231	Well, yeah.
1601611	1602271	I'm very proud.
1603152	1615335	See, we may have just said that X-Fur had to do it, but he's on because I'm actually following the rules, so we'll see how far this goes.
1617041	1617882	I've been pretty good.
1617922	1627890	Now, I didn't agree to the no fast food thing, but I've only had fast food twice this week, because I realized I did have it once today and once after last week's show.
1628190	1630512	So I've been averaging only once a week, so that's not bad.
1630572	1633475	And when I go, I don't supersize anything or whatever, and I got a decent sandwich.
1633915	1635316	So I think I'm doing okay.
1635917	1639419	It's better than my usual three or four times a week, so I'm good.
1640220	1644524	Well, for me, I didn't really know where the guidelines went for me.
1644564	1649548	I just kind of grabbed the mic last week and I was like, uh, is that me not going to do it too?
1649608	1651950	And you guys just kind of gave me that look and I'm like, uh.
1652677	1654599	What was the candy that broke you?
1672410	1674572	Um, I think... Probably Candy Corn!
1674592	1675332	That stuff's evil!
1675652	1680856	Actually, no, it was like the little tiny square piece of, um, Snickers or something.
1681116	1682537	Oh, one's not gonna kill ya.
1682677	1683438	I mean, one's okay.
1683458	1685799	It's just that you can't have one five times a day.
1685819	1688361	And, like, a little tiny vanilla Tootsie Roll.
1689880	1690921	They're so good.
1692482	1694144	Everybody was allowed to cheat on Halloween, right?
1694544	1696506	Yeah, but I just kind of started anyway.
1696546	1697867	I was like, eh, whatever.
1697887	1699929	I'm going to have to get used to it.
1701090	1701670	All is good.
1701911	1702991	When's our next weigh-in?
1703032	1704913	When are we going to do a weigh-in and check on the progress?
1705153	1705654	After the show.
1706014	1706835	Oh, crap.
1706875	1708637	Wait, did I just say yay?
1708857	1710778	How about we do it in the last take?
1711379	1712160	Okay, we can do that.
1714553	1720976	I have everything written down, but only you can see.
1721036	1723758	But I've got to actually make up the chart for everybody.
1724978	1725359	Sounds good.
1726799	1727840	I look forward to you later in the show.
1728323	1744290	Oh, you remember that little thing I kind of announced last week, like, oh boy, let's hope I get it or whatever, and I got word back, and I opened my email on Thursday at, what time was it, probably about 6.30.
1746010	1752213	Congratulations, you're a member of the member advisory board, which is that little council I was talking about last week.
1752753	1754854	So what exactly will you be doing as part of that?
1755819	1765337	Uh, six month term working closely with staff to advise on the community and blah, you know, pretty much NDA stuff, so, cool.
1765637	1766319	Okay, very cool.
1767831	1768971	All right, let's see.
1768991	1770012	My week and my day.
1770632	1772252	I just had a long week.
1772372	1774112	I did a lot, a lot of work this week.
1774152	1776053	It's been a very exhausting week, but good.
1776213	1777033	I mean, in a good way.
1777053	1778973	I like my job and stuff, so it's cool.
1780214	1782654	Went out Friday night with the one and only DarkSakura.
1782714	1787995	That was pretty cool because we went out to one of the local bars and we just kind of sat around.
1788056	1789096	We chilled.
1789436	1790096	I drank a lot.
1790396	1790876	DarkSakura.com
1809707	1810587	Thank you for watching!
1827990	1829092	No, he thought you were cool.
1829372	1836222	And then, you know, that night, actually, this would be Friday night, we were watching Elimidate at my friend's house.
1836903	1837263	Not Jamie.
1837283	1839547	Jamie was at home in bed by this point.
1839567	1843572	But we were watching Elimidate and on the TV came a commercial.
1844645	1853649	and it's the commercial featuring our very own Dark Sakura and Loki for the Guitar Hero story that's going to be on TV on Tuesday and it's awesome.
1854169	1858131	And it was just cool to see that during Elimidate because I know that's like one of Loki's favorite shows.
1860372	1862413	I thought Elimidate and Blind Date because they're on back to back.
1862493	1863833	I know you guys watch Blind Date.
1864033	1865434	It was on during both shows actually.
1865974	1868295	So, whatever.
1869156	1872117	Anyway, we actually have that story.
1873482	1876083	So we're going to, or not the story, but we have a little promo.
1876123	1879405	I just want to play it for our listeners here.
1881086	1885829	So they can hear DarkSakura's quote that will be in the news story, because it's pretty funny.
1886369	1888550	So let's see here if we can get this to play.
1888590	1891051	It's a little bit of movie time here on Orange Lounge Radio.
1893953	1894853	Loading, loading, loading.
1894933	1895254	Come on.
1897195	1897535	Here we go.
1898612	1900433	Tuesday on WB58 News at 10.
1901054	1903256	It feels like playing an actual guitar.
1903476	1906558	Get the rush of rocking out for an audience right in your own living room.
1906578	1908920	I love the remote, so I play that when it beats the dated.
1909180	1912023	There's a fun new way to make your musical dreams a reality.
1912223	1914965	You're actually creating music and playing in front of a crowd.
1915125	1918628	Find out why this rocking new game could be a big hit this holiday season.
1918948	1921190	People of all ages are really getting into this.
1921410	1922411	Tuesday on WB58 News at 10.
1925566	1934428	I love how in that promo there's like one shot of Loki for like two, not even a second.
1934468	1937969	There's just like a shot of Loki going on the guitar and that's it.
1938329	1941550	It was the equivalent of Loki's foot basically being in the new story.
1942330	1942850	So it's great.
1942910	1943630	And what else is new?
1943650	1945711	I guess the distance had the neat thing where I nodded my head.
1946911	1950512	And I think that's cool that DarkSakura is talking about the Ramones.
1950772	1953493	That kind of amused me when I saw that on TV.
1954473	1954613	So...
1956007	1957748	Anyway, we posted a link to that on the website.
1957768	1962011	Of course, Tuesday night is when the story is going to air, and we will hopefully have something.
1962491	1971576	I'm thinking the news stations, because it looks like they put a lot of their news stories on the website, so I'm thinking the news station might actually put it on their website, which would certainly make it easier for us to share it with all of you.
1971716	1976659	Because if they put the promo up there, they'll put the story up there, and then hopefully we'll have so much fun.
1977479	1976659	2.0.
1978160	1978720	So excited.
1979341	1979681	I hope.
1979701	1983283	You know, I'm guessing they're not even going to let me say anything.
1983463	1985284	I'll just be the guy in the background.
1986633	1988134	So what do you think about this game?
1988554	1989594	And then it'll just cut away.
1990054	1999518	You know what's great is my ignition pad is over there, and it's in the background of one of the shots, so my ignition pad got more screen time than yours did.
1999638	2003940	My Konami guitars are out, because we've been playing guitar for years before.
2004980	2005321	Right on.
2005421	2006501	And the Gemania set was out.
2007982	2008262	Awesome.
2009901	2015889	So, anyway, let's talk about Guitar Hero a little bit, because I finally managed to pick up the game this week.
2016149	2020254	I picked up Guitar Hero, and I've been playing the shit out of it since yesterday when I got it.
2020835	2020955	It's...
2021781	2022582	Really great.
2022762	2028947	I was really surprised considering that the last game Red Octane put out I wasn't too impressed with.
2029327	2037254	This one, being done by Harmonix, is so wonderful and it really makes me hopeful for whatever Red Octane is going to do in the future.
2037314	2040096	Maybe going to some other types of music.
2040156	2043919	I think the music game community is going to win big if this game does well.
2043959	2045840	And a lot of early reviews for this game...
2046721	2048203	have great scores.
2048324	2050026	I think GameSpot gave it a great review.
2050066	2053391	I know 1up.com gave it a perfect 10.
2054052	2055874	That's higher than a lot of DDR games get.
2056155	2060661	I think what people are really liking about the game is that it's very accessible.
2060841	2062364	It is.
2062604	2063185	It's a fun game.
2063365	2069728	My friend came over yesterday for Stargate Marathon, and I was playing a game while she was making pancakes.
2070788	2071488	Awesome.
2071948	2072989	Holy pancakes, they were yummy.
2073869	2078371	And I was playing just a couple of stuff, and she was like, oh my god, they got their original songs.
2078391	2079091	I was like, no.
2079771	2082633	No, the cover songs were that good, but the covers were really good.
2083313	2086154	They went to a great length to duplicate the effects.
2086434	2086974	Yeah, they did.
2087054	2093416	I mean, some of them, like the Franz Ferdinand song that I kind of like, it's in their sounds, just like the original.
2093516	2095316	And, like, Iron Man sounds great.
2095837	2097917	Some of them aren't exact, but they're close enough.
2097937	2100098	They're closer than any karaoke revolution, I think it's been.
2100118	2101378	I was freaking playing Thundercats 65.
2101638	2102158	That was cool.
2102278	2103019	Yeah, it's awesome.
2103459	2104259	It's got a great song.
2104319	2111601	My only kind of boo-hoo part is that there's not more songs playable at the very start, because yesterday, you know, I had some people over.
2111641	2114542	We were wanting to play Guitar Freaks, or Guitar Freaks, Guitar Hero.
2114622	2114862	Whoops.
2115922	2117443	Where's Freebird?
2138966	2140446	The thing said no Freebird!
2140546	2141487	I want Freebird!
2141587	2143267	They need to have Freebird in the sequel.
2143307	2145048	No Freebird and no Stairway to Heaven!
2145068	2149949	They need Freebird, and they need Stairway, and they need... Blur.
2151089	2153830	I was gonna say Sweet Home Alabama, but I guess we already have... Blur.
2154810	2155650	Sure, we can have Blur.
2155970	2156531	Metallica?
2157551	2159511	Like old Metallica, not new sellout Metallica?
2159531	2161792	Metallica...
2163208	2170931	I want to get some really hard rock stuff in here, like, you know, I'm going to get some metal, like, even get some filter in there, you know, some of that stuff.
2171931	2181315	Even, you know, even though they've kind of dissolved as a band, Gravity Kills would be fucking awesome, because they just had really good guitar sections in the whole stuff.
2181435	2182615	Same, that and Rammstein.
2182655	2185896	Rammstein had tons of really good guitar sections in their songs.
2186076	2187717	We need Guns N' Roses.
2188137	2188417	Yeah.
2188457	2188657	Yes.
2188737	2190738	We need, no, we need Welcome to the Jungle, I'm sorry.
2190758	2190958	Welcome!
2194034	2221525	I hope they link up to a later game I hope they decide to do a drum game I mean I guess that would be too similar but maybe hook up well I guess they can't even hook up to Karaoke Revolution because it's another company but somehow hook up to another you know what Red Octane should revive is keyboard games they should launch a keyboard game that would be badass expensive but fun Van Halen would be awesome too
2222703	2227829	DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
2237958	2243242	What else I wanted to say about Guitar Hero though, you know my favorite thing about Guitar Hero is the art direction.
2243982	2253809	The art and like the sets and the little like, just there's little jokes that make the cold game, like when you're loading and going to a new stage it shows it turning up to 11.
2254809	2260073	The female guitarist with the short black and red hair was actually modeled off of a real person.
2260521	2260821	Really?
2260941	2262882	Aren't they all supposed to be modeled off real people?
2262902	2269185	Well, I know there's like the Keith Richards clone that I just sort of freaked out over because the first time I saw him pop up was with a flying V. I was like, it's Murdoch!
2269465	2269706	Yeah.
2270146	2270706	Nerd moment!
2272547	2281051	And, yeah, I just, the art direction in the game isn't, like the little pictures drawn on the notebook, like they even have a unicorn drawn on the notebook, which made me think of, anyway, I forget it.
2283332	2284613	But the art direction in the game is great.
2284653	2288435	And there's just all these, I like the way it's set up.
2290034	2292056	Like, it's different than a Bomani game.
2292097	2293118	It does make me motion sick.
2293859	2294179	Really?
2294279	2294599	Why is that?
2294620	2295961	Just the ISO perspective thing?
2296081	2296442	Yeah.
2296542	2297483	And the way it's moving?
2297603	2298144	That's too bad.
2299790	2300390	Music is not MIDI!
2323545	2324746	Mass Riot Breaks Out
2342478	2365136	and then it shows the bill with your managers cut and the food cut and the bribery cuts and all that stuff leaving you with so much money like all that little stuff goes a long way in amusing me greatly and that's important to amuse me greatly so the way the game is presented it's not the same even as like amplitude and frequency because amplitude and frequency is almost walk up, play your songs, walk away the way the Guitar Hero is set up is cool and is what
2365396	2370219	Part of what makes that game so great and stand out so much differently than Guitar Freaks.
2370600	2374762	Honestly, Guitar Heroes and Guitar Freaks are very different games.
2375223	2381087	Yes, they both use guitar controllers, but you've got Guitar Hero has five buttons, which changes things completely.
2381287	2382247	And the whammy bar!
2382528	2383388	And the whammy bar!
2383768	2384429	Absolutely.
2384469	2385810	I was wailing hard, okay?
2386110	2393215	The way you turn your guitar up, the wailing thing, like in Guitar Freaks it was called a wailing bonus, it's done...
2394258	2396639	One thing I do sort of miss though that was in Guitar Freaks were the hidden notes.
2414427	2420118	Where if you, you know, manage to find the hidden notes, it would just pop up a whole new set of notes.
2420479	2421241	Or the open picks.
2421601	2421822	Yeah.
2422403	2425449	But still, I mean, Guitar Hero has... She gets freestyle points.
2426567	2428708	I got mine right when the shipment arrived at our GameStop.
2428728	2428848	Right.
2428868	2428948	Loki?
2454204	2466017	I was going to mention that the game's not even supposed to be out yet, but... Technically, but... Actually, I'm going to go ahead and say officially it had no street date on any of their shipped packages, therefore it could be released ASAP.
2466037	2474706	Well, yeah, I mean, games don't really have street dates, but the whole thing was they were not supposed to be shipping until Tuesday anyway, so a lot of this stuff's early.
2475325	2478189	I think it was kind of one of those things, like, they did it in the groove the very same way.
2478230	2479792	Like, it didn't really have an official release date.
2479832	2482256	It was just, you know, we're going to ship it out whenever you get it.
2482376	2484820	We got it pressed faster than we thought we would, so here you go.
2485498	2486439	Yeah, so that's cool.
2486619	2488821	I mean, so it's out there now if you guys want to look around.
2488861	2493625	But probably Tuesday, Wednesday is when you're really going to start seeing this game out there just about everywhere.
2493925	2495306	And I think it has the potential to do very well.
2495346	2496407	I thought it was interesting.
2496767	2500390	And I remember bringing this up on the show before about the MTV partnership with the game.
2500751	2504574	But I kind of forgot about it until I booted up the game and saw the MTV logo.
2504974	2509358	And even though MTV kind of sucks, I think the partnership is going to be great exposure for the game.
2509898	2523704	and what's really cool about the game is that all the unlocked songs are unsigned bands with a real song, like the people that won the Be a Guitar Hero contest and you know, littler bands, I guess I shouldn't say unsigned, but more littler, not so heard of bands.
2523724	2530707	The only band in there I'd really heard of before was Freeze Pop, because they have a song there that you unlock and it's badass.
2530867	2532268	I love the Freeze Pop song.
2532628	2533368	Get ready to rock.
2534109	2534629	It's great.
2536280	2539563	So anyway, I definitely give a glowing review to Guitar Hero.
2539583	2542385	I think it's fabulous, and you all should go buy it if you want to play a guitar game.
2542646	2547770	The price tag's a little bit high, so maybe they'll come down in price after Christmas, and maybe it would be a better time to get it.
2548130	2549231	But it's great.
2549372	2550833	It's so much fun.
2553535	2554576	Any other thoughts on Guitar Hero?
2556037	2557158	We'll talk a little... Oh, Angel.
2558560	2562103	I like how the notes at the bottom of the screen, like the colors...
2563385	2573509	For the notes, because it obviously goes with the buttons, but, you know, they're bright on the screen, so for me, it'll be easier to play, since I am color and shape oriented.
2574430	2586895	Well, you guys knew that, but, um, yeah, so, it'll be easier for me to play, and for those that have difficulty like I do, well, it'll be a good thing, so I can't wait to pick it up!
2587255	2587355	Ah!
2589537	2590378	Alright, sounds good.
2590638	2593480	Yeah, it's very bright and all the colors stand out.
2593540	2594180	It's very nice.
2595081	2595461	Very nice.
2596562	2601645	Basically, the way it's set up, just imagine it's frequency or amplitude, except you don't move around the tube.
2601685	2603927	It's just the ISO view of the notes coming at you.
2604607	2608770	Which sometimes can be a little bit bothersome, though, because you can't see the notes as far in advance.
2608850	2611832	And for me, I'm really big on noticing the measures.
2611912	2614394	Like in Guitar Freaks, you can see the little lines that show you the measures.
2614714	2619237	But in Guitar Hero, it's harder to see those lines and judge because it's at an ISO perspective.
2619637	2621438	So it's kind of, I don't know, it's kind of tricky.
2621678	2623479	But those are really minor, minor complaints.
2623779	2629963	I would hope that in a later version you could maybe change that, like tilt the perspective to something that works better for me.
2630003	2632385	Like that would be great if you could freely rotate the perspective.
2632405	2633185	I'm sure it's possible.
2633945	2636507	But that's a very minor complaint in the scope of things, honestly.
2636607	2637828	It's a great first release.
2638188	2639389	A lot of promising things.
2639569	2640589	Kick-ass song list.
2642010	2642370	I love it.
2642711	2643031	It's great.
2644724	2644784	D.R.
2644804	2645845	Mario Mix Guitar Hero
2664562	2668804	I think I'm playing Smoke on the Water My hand was about to fall off This song's long, it's like 7 minutes
2692523	2696810	Alright, we'll be back after this with more Orange Lounge Radio.
2696890	2701717	I guess we'll start off this break with a little bit of, we'll start off with a classic Guitar Freaks tune.
2701998	2703981	We'll be back after this with more Orange Lounge Radio.
2867740	2868701	It's great, man!
3014213	3015094	Thank you for watching!
3097458	3098699	Orange Lounge Radio.
3099019	3101180	We put your thing down, flip it, and reverse it.
3111735	3114337	I'm trekking on along here after that Guitar Freaks break.
3114417	3122524	We were checking out during the break some folks in our chat room posted that some websites out there have leaked some new Beatmania screenshots.
3123785	3126607	Screens from the brand new Beatmania game and I totally missed this.
3126647	3128609	I guess these were actually released earlier in the week.
3129370	3131271	But very interesting, some of these screenshots.
3131932	3137697	Maybe I missed this before if this was previously announced, but I noticed one of these screens shows the free scratching zone.
3138297	3141098	DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
3160226	3161727	How often do they use them in songs?
3161747	3162227	Not very.
3162507	3170211	I swear, the five key game I probably played the most of was Beatmania 6 mix and core, that release, and I don't remember seeing this in there.
3170731	3173292	There was like a couple songs, a handful.
3173552	3174693	Maybe that was just on crack, I don't know.
3176333	3184897	Very interesting purpley interface there, and also, by the way, which shows that V is in the game, but that shouldn't be a big shock to anybody, that V is going to turn up in Beatmania USA.
3184917	3185157	Why not?
3185217	3188399	It's been like every other... Every Japanese release since 5th.
3189594	3190134	Every single one.
3190154	3192615	Did you know that TenStyle is only like a few days away?
3193515	3194015	It's not that far.
3194055	3196195	I think TenStyle is like 10 days away, somebody was telling me.
3196855	3197255	Crazy.
3199156	3200536	So BeatMini is very purple.
3200596	3201776	It's a very different interface.
3202216	3209938	I can appreciate that they're doing something new with it, not just, you know, cloning a Japanese release and taking out some songs and putting in different ones.
3210038	3217459	It makes the game feel very much like ours, even if you don't care for purple or don't really care for the interface, at least it's something a little different.
3217799	3218139	Hey, L.O.G. ?
3220208	3223670	Thanks for watching!
3237881	3245604	All right, I think what we'll do now before we get to list list because I don't think everyone's quite ready to go yet.
3246144	3261209	I think what maybe we'll do is we'll go to the Skype line and take some telephone calls on the Skype line, www.orangeloungeradio.com and click on interact with us if you would like to get more information about how you can call the program.
3262189	3272304	You can either use your computer using a program called Skype, or you can actually use our brand new phone number, which I don't remember off the top of my head, but it's posted on the website.
3272905	3274007	But the phone's already ringing.
3274047	3275128	I don't need to give out that phone number.
3275148	3276190	We're going to go right to a call.
3276250	3277932	So, hello, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
3279776	3280677	Hey Siggy, how you doing?
3281698	3283840	I'm a little bit anticipated right now.
3284180	3284480	You're what?
3284540	3286823	A little bit anticipated.
3287343	3288084	Anticipated?
3288124	3288544	Why's that?
3289065	3290967	Because 10 days left.
3291167	3293189	Beatmania 2DX, TenStyle, CS.
3293669	3294130	That's right.
3294170	3298494	You were telling me about this before the show, that we don't have much longer to go before TenStyle's going to be out.
3298514	3299015	That's awesome.
3299895	3304319	Yeah, well, I got a little news about Ten Style CS for those who haven't caught up with it yet.
3304940	3305260	Oh yeah?
3305300	3305680	What's that?
3306161	3309784	Two Happy Sky songs have been confirmed for Ten Style CS.
3310885	3311325	What's that?
3311986	3314228	That's Lesson 5 and Under the Sky.
3315209	3315649	Awesome.
3315789	3320311	So we don't just get one, we get two Happy Sky songs.
3320411	3321011	That's good news.
3321772	3325013	So far, there have been 24 unconfirmed songs yet.
3325974	3326354	Really?
3327154	3333917	Probably until this Thursday, we won't be seeing, you know, Konami's going to reveal the entire complete song list.
3334097	3335217	Hopefully by this Thursday.
3336058	3338058	Oh yeah, seeing as the games come out very soon.
3338739	3340960	All those songs, of course, being done by LED.
3344063	3351366	It's all V. It's all remixes of V. Speaking of V, yeah, V has been confirmed for Beatmania US.
3351727	3353367	Not a big surprise, though, honestly.
3353507	3355288	Nah, not a big surprise to me either.
3355989	3359990	So, in fact, if V hadn't have been there, you know people would have complained.
3360030	3360911	Where's V?
3361331	3362772	Why didn't they put V in there?
3363212	3364492	Konami hates us.
3364552	3366033	Konami hates America.
3366373	3367854	Konami USA sucks.
3367894	3369615	Why didn't they put my fucking V in there?
3372233	3373494	You know that's how it would have been.
3374114	3375635	Yeah.
3376495	3383639	Talking about other stuff, well, you haven't premiered the Matsumoto Goliath's bonus track yet, right?
3383699	3387921	No, I keep meaning to, and I always forget to play it, but it's a great song.
3387961	3388682	I love the video.
3388842	3389582	The video's very cool.
3389602	3392704	I really love the video, too, and I'm hoping that this song is going to be on the 10,000.
3393144	3394885	Yes, it's a bonus song.
3395525	3395945	It might.
3396185	3396746	That would be cool.
3398026	3399727	Yeah, so should I reveal it now?
3400307	3400648	Sure, do it.
3401590	3405252	Okay, here's from the Goliath's bonus track.
3406032	3407993	Here's Terra with Alphyshear.
3408153	3409674	Oh, I thought you were just going to name it.
3409734	3410014	Hold on.
3410034	3411174	I've got to actually play it?
3411234	3411514	Hold on.
3412675	3413375	Sorry about that.
3414216	3414616	That's all right.
3414636	3414856	Hold on.
3415096	3415516	We can play it.
3415536	3417117	We'll play... How long is it?
3417157	3418037	I don't remember how long it is.
3418057	3419798	It's about 2 minutes 45 seconds.
3419838	3420498	Oh, that's not that long.
3420538	3421319	We can go ahead and play that.
3421539	3422359	I've got to get it, though.
3422399	3422719	Here we go.
3423300	3423940	Okay, so here it is.
3424160	3425420	Okay, from the top.
3425461	3426081	Introduce it again.
3427519	3431603	Here's the Goliath bonus track and tarot with Alpharshir.
3431963	3434085	And for those in studio, you can see the video if you want.
3434105	3434585	It's pretty cool.
3456366	3458368	Thank you for watching!
3482715	3483777	Thank you for watching!
3519256	3523418	I've been collecting the fragments of you that have changed into eternity
3560159	3561660	Thank you for watching!
3588208	3590450	Now that song is pretty badass, I gotta say.
3590710	3595093	It's a really good song, and I do hope that song does turn up in Ten Styles, one of the hidden tracks, because it's great.
3595113	3596074	And the video's great, too.
3596394	3600117	Like, you know, we're kind of sitting here in the studio watching it, and I'm hearing, ooh, I need an LJ Akana that.
3600518	3601919	Ooh, I need to cosplay that.
3601999	3602599	I need to do this.
3602679	3602939	I need to...
3604040	3605442	It's got a nice video, I like the setup.
3605682	3612070	For those who weren't able to see the video, it basically is, um, it's kind of like this epic battle with all the 2DX characters.
3612230	3612931	That's kind of what it is.
3613311	3613892	It looks like.
3613932	3614092	Yeah.
3614693	3616595	It's like, you know, it's like a bit from Eden.
3617316	3617757	Yeah.
3618778	3620780	Um, some expressions like...
3621941	3625824	Thank you for reminding us to check that out, because it's a pretty cool one, so thank you.
3625844	3626164	No problem.
3652509	3654431	Alright, well, anything else you want to share with our listeners?
3655011	3656273	Well, nothing much else.
3656313	3660276	Hopefully, when I get my copy of Tenstar, I will give you the details.
3660797	3661518	Alright, sounds good.
3661538	3662498	We'll be looking forward to hearing it.
3663199	3663419	Yeah.
3663700	3664841	Alright, take care, buddy.
3664861	3665241	Have a good one.
3665882	3666142	Later.
3666282	3666482	Later.
3669845	3675451	Okay, we're going to go to another call now here on the Skype line, and we'll see what this person wants.
3675511	3676572	Hello, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
3679874	3680354	Yes, we're here.
3680474	3681415	Can you hear me?
3681515	3682335	We can kind of hear you.
3682355	3682676	What's up?
3684137	3685097	Uh, not much.
3685417	3686158	I'm eating Doritos.
3686758	3688499	You're eating Doritos again, huh?
3688539	3689120	How you doing?
3690321	3692122	Uh, we got nacho this time.
3693043	3693483	I'm sorry?
3694443	3696805	We got nacho this time.
3697065	3698466	Nacho cheese this time.
3698486	3699407	Alright, what's on your mind?
3700468	3703249	Uh, I'm really hyped for Mario Kart DS.
3704315	3705736	You're hyped for Mario Kart DS.
3705796	3706816	I'm really hyped for this, too.
3706856	3711339	I think it's going to be awesome to be able to play people across the internet and all that stuff.
3711999	3712219	Yeah.
3713440	3717643	The news video I just saw, what was it, 25 minutes?
3718043	3719944	Just revealed a bunch of stuff.
3721425	3721885	It's crazy.
3722505	3725867	So, this game's out, what, like a week from Tuesday or something?
3725887	3731710	Yeah, it's out, yeah, it's the week of the 14th, sometime during that week.
3731730	3732531	That's the date.
3733157	3734017	I'm excited for it.
3734117	3734878	It's going to be a good time.
3736759	3740861	So now I hear you can have up to 50 people on your friends list or something through the game?
3741981	3742361	I don't know.
3742381	3743162	They didn't say that.
3743322	3745163	It's only four player though for the internet.
3746023	3750125	Well, I'm not too surprised by that because eight people would be an awful lot of bandwidth to have going everywhere.
3751326	3753087	Yeah, you don't want all that lag and stuff.
3753407	3753607	Yeah.
3754167	3755248	That sucks.
3755788	3757829	Any other games coming out soon that you're looking forward to?
3758359	3762102	You still have to give Midway Arcade Treasures 3 and DDR Mario Mix.
3764204	3767166	Midway Arcade Treasures 3 is pretty good.
3767366	3770809	It's a pretty solid game if you like racing games.
3770929	3782318	If you're waiting for more Midway Arcade stuff for the PSP, Arcade Treasures Extended Play is coming out in December, which is going to have a bunch of the old stuff plus Mortal Kombat 1 and 2.
3783459	3783879	Very cool.
3784454	3784975	I know about that.
3785715	3786176	Very cool.
3787297	3788638	Alright, anything else you want to share with our listeners?
3789259	3789679	Oh, yeah.
3790280	3791661	I got a link to this one site.
3792082	3799149	There's this guy who has made tons of progress on hacking the DS's Wi-Fi chip and stuff.
3799589	3801431	He's pretty much got it technically running.
3802252	3802752	Huh.
3803093	3804154	So what does it do?
3805935	3810117	Um, right now he's just trying to make the connection to a Wi-Fi hotspot.
3810857	3823262	Yeah, this is the guy that's, he's already won the bounty, basically, for the Wi-Fi, and now he's just finishing up, like, the last bit of it, but he finished enough of it to where they gave him, like, I think it was like $4,000.
3823362	3826724	Oh, I remember you mentioning that on a previous podcast about that.
3827104	3827484	Very cool.
3827504	3827584	Yeah.
3833050	3836273	That link's in our chatroom, www.orangeandradio.com, click on chat.
3838074	3847382	Another thing, just more Mario Kart DS stuff, there's actually the decal maker, you know what I'm talking about?
3847462	3848743	The decals, you can have in it.
3850784	3851685	On Mario Kart?
3851725	3854728	Yeah, can't you make your own decal or something when you're on the internet?
3855293	3863422	Yeah, uh, just, it, like, has a thing that'll connect to your name and also actually go on your cart on, like, the front of it and stuff.
3863602	3864483	Yeah, that sounds kinda cool.
3865164	3866165	I'm gonna post another link.
3866185	3869409	They actually have a, like, decal base on this site.
3870690	3874891	And you can make one before the game's even out, which is really cool.
3875671	3877212	I've got one here.
3878612	3883554	It's actually the Firefox logo, and it looks really good for just 17 colors.
3884874	3889395	It uses that technique of crisscrossing colors, you know what I'm talking about?
3889535	3890536	Yeah, yeah.
3890556	3891816	To make them look like a different color.
3892356	3892996	Okay, I'm going to check that.
3893196	3895657	So wait, you can make this before the game is out?
3895717	3897717	So you'll be able to transfer it from your PC somehow?
3897737	3902318	Well, you're not going to be able to transfer it, but you can plan it out and make one already.
3902358	3904979	You're going to have to recreate it, unfortunately.
3905159	3907979	Mr. Game & Watch!
3910100	3912460	Jamie's getting excited over there because she saw Mr. Game & Watch.
3913860	3914781	Yeah, that's funny.
3914961	3915901	Awesome, it's going to be a good time.
3916161	3921202	Alright, well thanks for sharing all those links with us, and we'll be all ready to kick your ass when Mario Kart DS comes out.
3921992	3924893	Oh, don't be so sure about that.
3925253	3926893	It's on.
3927794	3930594	We will have some type of Orange Lounge DS-a-thon, I'm sure.
3931195	3940517	I know my dream is to have the Orange Lounge Village on Animal Crossing, where you can come to our town and have Jamie whack you with a bug net.
3941538	3943358	That would be a good time.
3943378	3945419	We'll have that set up Sunday nights during the show or something.
3945639	3947479	We'll have the Orange Lounge Village where you can come.
3948179	3949340	I have all these great ideas.
3949400	3949820	I can't wait.
3951331	3951571	Okay.
3951772	3952092	All right.
3952152	3952752	Well, have a good one.
3952773	3953333	Thanks for calling.
3953954	3954214	Thanks.
3954414	3954674	All right.
3954714	3954975	Later.
3956977	3958859	Lots and lots of people hammering the line tonight.
3958899	3960821	Let's go to one more call for now.
3961581	3962662	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
3963547	3964728	Hi, this is GS191.
3964848	3967710	Hey, GS191, what's on your mind?
3968630	3972913	I just want to come on and whore out the Orange Launch Radio frapper.
3973334	3978297	Yes, now, the frapper, this was something that you created that you were plugging on the forums.
3978337	3979077	This is pretty cool.
3979097	3979978	Tell our listeners about this.
3981519	3992326	It basically just lets you, like, you can, like, let listeners, like... Are you still there?
3992366	3993207	You cut out for a minute there.
3993755	3995497	Yeah, yeah, I'm thinking.
3995638	3995898	Sorry.
3996038	3996419	It's alright.
3996639	3997941	Let me help you out.
3997981	4000344	It looks like something that's based off of Google Maps or something?
4000404	4001546	Yes, it is.
4001666	4003248	And it allows you to plot points?
4004089	4004309	Yeah.
4004369	4009697	Kind of so, but you guys as the listeners can plot points on this map so we can see where you live.
4010796	4011397	Yeah, pretty much.
4011877	4012778	And I'm going to post a link.
4012858	4014940	Oh, it looks like we both did at the same time there.
4015220	4024549	Post a link to the official Orange Lounge Radio Frapper, so you guys should go visit it and plot yourself on the map, and that way we can see just where all our listeners are.
4024609	4031355	And so when we see that we have a lot of listeners in one area, we might have to go, oh, we better send somebody to a tournament or something, get some coverage out there.
4031375	4031455	Yeah.
4032429	4033790	Oh yeah, yeah.
4055274	4057717	So go add yourself to the frapper, boys and girls.
4058178	4065929	And if you're not in the chat room and couldn't get the link, it's www.frappr.com slash Orange Lounge Radio.
4069460	4079088	Alright, well thank you so much for making that and suggesting that, GS191, and I hope we get tons of people on it, so we can be giddy map people, I don't know.
4080250	4080490	Alright.
4081531	4082031	Sure, thanks.
4082111	4082452	Yeah, sure.
4082632	4083252	Alright, take care.
4083272	4084654	Okay, you too, bye.
4084674	4084854	Bye.
4086229	4088970	All right, we're going to go ahead and turn off the Skype line for now.
4088990	4091312	We will take more calls a little later on in the program.
4092152	4097835	However, I think at this point, we're going to go ahead and get into the Orange Lounge Radio cage match for tonight.
4097915	4099095	Does that sound like fun, boys and girls?
4099896	4100076	Oui.
4100956	4110263	Alright, so I gotta get the Cage Match music queued up, but of course we had a retiree from last week, so we're gonna have three brand new songs in tonight's Cage Match.
4110283	4114106	So tonight's Cage Match is gonna take a little more time than usual, because we're gonna have three songs in their entirety.
4115307	4116008	Let's get it started.
4117486	4124490	Alright, the way the Orange Lounge Radio Cage Match works is that you have to be in our chat room at www.orangeloungeradio.com.
4124850	4140360	We are going to play three songs for you, and since there is no reigning champion, because we retired last week's winner, as it was its fourth win in a row, that was Pendulum with Hold Your Color, that song was retired, we're going to play three brand new songs for you in their entirety, okay?
4140880	4158665	So, you're going to vote for your favorite in our chatroom at www.orangeloungeradio.com and your favorite song that you guys vote for will go into rotation all week long on Orange Lounge Radio's 24-hour day, 7-day-a-week, Bimani and Video Game Music program, which has had a lot of you guys listening to it lately, so we appreciate that.
4159305	4160766	Alright, so let's get it started.
4160806	4164447	I guess I will go ahead since I technically...
4165433	4166835	Hold Your Color by Pendulum
4184537	4185378	Depeche Mode Precious
4219660	4229564	Precious and fragile things Need special handling My God, what have we done to you?
4229604	4235167	We always tried to share The tenderest of care Now look what we have
4288164	4296651	Angels with silver wings Shoulder no suffering I wish I could take the pain for you If God has a master plan That only he understands I hope it's
4329240	4330485	I thought we'd manage
4378641	4380382	Thanks for watching!
4442645	4444926	Alright, that was song number one in tonight's cage match.
4444946	4446666	That was Depeche Mode with Precious.
4447086	4449747	Was that song the Precious or was that song the crappy?
4450527	4452147	Our judges in studio will let you know.
4452327	4452968	DarkSakura.
4453388	4460410	I haven't really cared for anything Depeche Mode's done since the 80s because as I'm, you know, prone to calling them depressed mode.
4460850	4461950	Yeah, there's a little emo.
4466781	4467783	It's very sedate.
4468083	4475054	It actually reminds me of some of the stuff from Silent Hill 3 along the same lines.
4476376	4477157	I like it a lot.
4477637	4478719	As listening, it gets a 10.
4479200	4480241	For cage magic, it gets an 8.
4481263	4482484	Okay, it is a little emo.
4482584	4483585	I'll go ahead and do my ranking.
4483865	4490749	It is a little emo and a little sad for Cage Match, but I'm in a chill mood lately, where I'm in an emo mood, I guess.
4490789	4491269	I'll admit it.
4491490	4492570	I can be emo once in a while.
4493011	4494972	So I give that song an 8 as well.
4495512	4495872	It's fun.
4496233	4496533	Loki.
4497453	4504678	Now, I think, I was going to say, Depeche Mode is kind of going the way of Crystal Method, where their last album sucked.
4505302	4508042	Crystal Method's last album sucks, but the one before it was really good.
4508923	4517364	And this one, if this is one of the best songs on the album, then I'm kind of leery because I really did like Exciter.
4517684	4519905	That was one of my favorite Depeche Mode albums.
4520705	4524965	And this one, it's okay, but I have to listen to the rest of it before I can make my judgment on the whole thing.
4524985	4526306	But I give it an 8.
4526406	4527086	It's pretty good.
4527146	4528866	It's just Depeche Mode can't really do wrong.
4528986	4531507	Alright.
4531527	4532907	8, 8, 8, and now it's Angel's turn.
4532927	4533867	Angel, what do you think?
4535259	4536160	It's Depeche Mode.
4536260	4536960	It's cool.
4539042	4539222	Eight.
4540083	4542785	Right, I somehow knew she'd give it an eight as well.
4543626	4544706	How could you not at that point?
4544726	4546788	Alright, eights across the board for Depeche Mode Precious.
4547048	4549971	But remember, it's not up to us to decide.
4550311	4551492	Our scores don't mean shit.
4551592	4552953	It's like that game Whose Line Is Anyway.
4552973	4553954	The scores don't mean shit.
4554294	4555895	It's up to you guys and your votes in the chatroom.
4555915	4557877	We're just kind of coaxing you.
4558337	4561939	I believe that was the first time we've done that across the board, actually.
4562019	4562459	In a while.
4562519	4563440	I know it's been done before.
4563680	4570103	Because I remember, as soon as I remember, there was a mix of girls who was in the cage match once that got like zeros across the board from everybody, including Loki.
4572104	4575166	Anyway, let's go on to the next song, the second song of tonight's cage match.
4575186	4576446	We're going to go ahead and do Loki's pick.
4576606	4577547	Loki, what'd you pick tonight?
4579891	4582452	I picked a song that's off of the CD.
4582812	4586353	It's actually pretty cool.
4586413	4591555	Kalinda, I've never heard of them before, but they're on one of those compilation trance CDs.
4592055	4593035	And it sounded pretty good.
4593275	4594276	It's upbeat, short.
4595296	4596216	That's all you need to know.
4596477	4597257	It's upbeat and short.
4597877	4599377	Alright, well we'll be the judges of that.
4599438	4601538	Here it is, song number two in tonight's cage match.
4601818	4603559	Kalinda with I'll Surrender.
4737191	4742278	I'm giving up this fight I'm giving up this fight
4822506	4824587	Okay, that was song number two in tonight's cage match.
4824607	4828509	That was Kalinda, or maybe Kalienda, with I'll Surrender.
4828829	4831330	Will you surrender to that song, or will you hold it hostage?
4831990	4832491	DarkSakura.
4832571	4833491	I don't want to do either.
4834792	4835692	It was generic.
4835712	4836792	I think it's a five.
4838733	4846717	I have to admit, usually those are the types of songs I'm a sucker for, and there was some lovely instrumentation in that song, and the woman did have a pretty voice, but I just...
4847728	4849349	I'm too emo for that song tonight.
4849729	4854972	I really am in an emo mood today, so I can't appreciate that song as much as I should, so I have to give it like a 6.
4855932	4856752	I'm very sorry, Loki.
4856872	4857153	Loki.
4857993	4866077	It gets an 8, and ironically enough, that's the amount of max sim files that have been posted to my cell since they've relaunched.
4866897	4867358	Beautiful.
4867858	4872640	Alright, Angel, what did you think of I'll Surrender?
4872660	4873781	It was okay.
4876315	4877556	Um, 7 1⁄2.
4877797	4879899	Nice.
4879979	4880579	7 1⁄2 from Angel.
4880659	4883742	Okay, song number three tonight is DarkSakura's pick.
4883802	4885163	DarkSakura, what did you choose for us?
4886004	4888406	Only by Nine Inch Nails, just because.
4888867	4889407	Just because?
4890228	4891890	Yeah, I've been in the mood.
4891930	4896194	Is this like one of their hard-hitting industrial songs, or is this kind of a... You'll find out.
4896594	4897675	Oh, well, oh snap.
4897755	4898316	Okay, we will.
4898376	4898856	Here we go.
4899337	4901659	Song number three is Nine Inch Nails with Only.
4916738	4917805	Thanks for watching!
4962057	4963579	Thanks for watching!
5018069	5023164	I just want you all to remember me myself again And I just want you all to know
5074471	5075697	Thanks for watching!
5170536	5175520	All right, that was... Sorry, I'm laughing because they're having the soda versus pop debate in chat.
5175540	5176782	We'll get to that in a minute.
5176802	5181185	For now, let's review song number three, Nine Inch Nails with Only.
5181225	5188952	Is that the only song for you, or is that a song you would like to, I don't know, equivalent to Nine Inch Nails on a chalkboard?
5190513	5190994	DarkSakura.
5196697	5213405	You know, it's not the usual Nine Inch Nails song, and if I was in a normal mood, I would probably penalize the song for not sounding like a normal Nine Inch Nails song.
5213745	5215626	However, it fits my emo mood.
5215646	5217347	Therefore, it gets a bonus point, and I give it a 9.
5219760	5224282	I am in a normal mood, and I'm going to penalize it for not being a normal Nine Inch Nails song.
5224862	5227484	It gets a 5.
5229164	5232766	Angel has left the room momentarily, but we would assume that she would give it a 10.
5234026	5235307	Well, yeah, she gave everything else an 8 tonight.
5235367	5235987	Oh, there's Angel.
5236728	5238388	What would you give that song, Nine Inch Nails only?
5241350	5241470	An 8.
5242725	5244185	See, there you go.
5244505	5247366	But remember, it's not up to us, it's up to you.
5247846	5249946	Here are the three songs you can vote for tonight.
5249986	5252367	A quick recap in tonight's cage match.
5252407	5254667	Three brand new songs, no returning champions.
5254707	5256588	Song number one, Precious, Depeche Mode.
5263069	5267450	And song number two you can vote for tonight is Kalenda with I'll Surrender.
5275235	5278431	And song number three you can vote for tonight is Nine Inch Nails with Only
5286458	5289702	All right kids, place vote now.
5290162	5299051	Send a private message to Sky in the chat room with your vote for Depeche Mode, song number one, Calienda, song number two, or Nine Inch Nails, song number three.
5299451	5299731	Do it.
5299851	5300352	Do it now.
5300452	5301613	All the cool kids are doing it.
5301653	5306258	And if you don't, you are going to get a massive wedgie from all of us.
5307728	5314274	Loki, what's going on in the sim scene, dare I ask, in the Dance Dance Revolution and other music gaming simulation?
5314734	5322661	As I mentioned before, with the eight brand new Max remixes, not much as far as the sim file section goes on my cell, or at least all the...
5324063	5327526	Submissions, but there is another tournament going on.
5327926	5352403	Since TourneyMix is gone for good, hopefully, we have OSC 4, or the original step file competition 4, and basically the rules are a little bit different than TourneyMix, and basically the main stuff is... Let's see here...
5354008	5360374	Basically, the staff can't enter, which is probably good, because why would they be voting on their own songs?
5361374	5369882	But anyways, there's going to be one... I don't know, it looks exactly the same to me, to be honest.
5369902	5372784	They have different divisions, DDR, Indigroove, and Keyboard.
5373364	5380551	So I'm guessing Playable, Not Quite Playable, and Not Playable would be those three categories.
5381291	5381471	And...
5383114	5387458	It doesn't really say when the submissions are due yet, but let's see.
5387638	5389020	Oh, my mistake.
5389440	5390581	November 13th is one.
5391743	5394045	So you said that Tournamix is gone forever?
5394866	5395346	Supposedly.
5398930	5402954	There's no public voting, so basically it's just by panel review.
5405470	5411371	The public, though, can post the reviews for the songs in each division when they're released and rank it.
5411971	5419273	And the average score from the public review is then taken and will make up 50% of the song's final division score.
5420993	5427355	And hopefully, hopefully, they will post, or they won't post, who the song was made by.
5427975	5428995	You know, then make it fair.
5429355	5432036	But I don't think that's going to happen.
5433922	5441809	So yeah, that's about it other than Dance Tracks, a new Stepmania-based game making its way to the web.
5443610	5446453	And of course, hopefully pretty soon, the arcades.
5447954	5457522	No real details on it at all other than the fact that you've got people like DM Ashura, B-Drop, and just other people doing music for it.
5458183	5459604	So, it'll be interesting.
5461446	5461706	That's it.
5463357	5463717	All right.
5465578	5473301	Moving on, DarkSakura, I know you were surfing the web a little bit there in the background, and you found some pictures from an upcoming movie that we're very excited about.
5473321	5475342	I thought maybe you wanted to share this with our listeners.
5475722	5476643	Oh, yeah.
5476783	5480304	Silent Hill movie image is up on IGN.
5480364	5483406	One of our listeners linked it on our website, on our forums.
5485626	5493209	Anyone who was basically naysaying, if these images are any type of indication, it is Silent Hill.
5493329	5493929	It's official.
5495349	5496830	Very, very perfect.
5498991	5503332	Down to the environment, down to the...
5508047	5510788	Even the colors that the characters are dressed in is very somber.
5511629	5513009	It completely matches the style.
5513349	5514970	I'm very excited after seeing the pictures.
5515030	5516671	It looks like they're going to get it right.
5516711	5519192	I'm so excited that they might get a video game movie right.
5519232	5520113	I'm just elated.
5520613	5522153	So I'm very, very happy about that.
5522193	5525075	Of course, then again, the Mortal Kombat pictures were cool when I first saw them, too.
5525455	5526335	But I have hope.
5526715	5529897	These three can look like they're from the game, only better quality, of course.
5530197	5538541	In other news, during the Saw II of the previews, they played Blood Rains, which I yelled out in the middle of the audience, A MOVIE FUCKING SUCKS!
5539041	5539701	Everyone laughed.
5541662	5543203	I need to see Doom so I can laugh at it.
5544783	5546884	I think Doom has already fallen out of the top ten movies.
5547385	5548005	It's gone.
5548205	5548565	It's gone.
5549125	5551807	And made, I think, like half of its budget back, if even that.
5554515	5555316	Let's see, what else?
5556016	5561298	Oh, did you guys hear this week what movie has got a push to be made now?
5562679	5567781	A video game movie was licensed out and now has a director attached and the script's being written for?
5568261	5569141	Castlevania.
5569802	5571482	Castlevania's being turned into a movie.
5571823	5573723	It better be done right, that's all I can say.
5573803	5575424	Here's who's attached to direct.
5575764	5577365	I believe his name is Paul Anderson.
5577405	5579586	He was the guy that did Mortal Kombat and Resident Evil.
5579986	5583499	Well now, Mortal Kombat was a good movie and Resident Evil was a good movie.
5584645	5586607	Well, I like Resident Evil, shut up.
5587207	5588008	They were fun.
5588288	5588728	I'll give it that.
5588768	5589469	They were fun movies.
5589489	5591511	They weren't Oscar caliber movies, but they were fun.
5591531	5592812	Mortal Kombat, I think, was done right.
5592832	5594433	They were tolerable.
5595574	5599457	You know, when you put them next to a UE Bowl movie, I mean, honestly, it doesn't look that bad.
5599737	5600618	They actually are pretty good.
5600658	5605762	Mortal Kombat was, you put Mortal Kombat, the movie, next to Street Fighter, the movie, and it's like, oh, I'll watch Mortal Kombat like 20 times.
5605982	5606363	Seriously.
5606663	5611487	So, honestly, probably Paul Anderson, to date, has set the bar for
5612087	5614549	A decent video game movie that is yet to be exceeded.
5614709	5618391	I don't think there has been a better video game movie than Mortal Kombat or Resident Evil.
5618511	5621293	I'm quite excited about the Peter Jackson Halo.
5621613	5626656	But see, with Silent Hill on deck and Halo eventually, I think it's going to push the bar up.
5627036	5627256	I'm hoping.
5627276	5627676	I hope so too.
5627756	5630938	And Uwe Boll needs to stop making movies.
5631499	5632059	Period.
5633690	5637551	Of course we talked about on the last podcast the Dungeon Siege is going to be two movies.
5637912	5638992	Four hours long.
5639152	5640813	It's an epic Uwe Boll event.
5640833	5660139	I have not actually seen an Uwe Boll movie yet just because they're so bad but I really need to sit down so I can nitpick them on particular issues because I know that just the movies overall are really bad and uninspiring and just awful but I'm kind of curious to see Blood Rain because at least she gets naked.
5660399	5662820	So at least they've got that going for it.
5663615	5665116	So, yeah, that'd be good.
5666716	5669317	No, no, no, I don't even need it.
5669337	5670097	Bye, bye.
5670277	5671738	I thought you were going to comment on something.
5672118	5675639	Weren't you excited about Castlevania, the movie, or as I call it, Castlevania?
5677120	5677880	Mmm, Simon.
5678100	5678481	Simon?
5679281	5679541	Okay.
5680714	5682795	Let's hope to hell to get the right actor to play Simon.
5683095	5685456	I know, why don't they just have Hugh Jackman do it again?
5686356	5686957	I have an idea.
5687077	5690558	How about we get Vin Diesel to play Simon Belmont?
5691358	5692199	How about no?
5692879	5695320	Jim Carrey is Simon Belmont.
5695380	5702043	You know, not to throw this topic in the gutter, but Vin Diesel is a very, very big joke around World of Warcraft right now.
5702083	5702563	Anyway, whatever.
5704824	5708367	Vin Diesel will play, Arnold Schwarzenegger will play all the characters in the movie.
5708547	5710729	Dave Chappelle as Simon Belmont.
5712791	5715693	Like Carlos Bensia as Dracula.
5718495	5720397	And Pablo Francisco as the background effects?
5720717	5721258	Uh, never mind.
5724220	5726622	Jigsaw the Clown is Simon Belmont.
5726642	5728303	Let me wait.
5730512	5732232	Moving on, that should be interesting.
5733613	5738854	Oh no, before we go to a break, I want to talk about Xbox 360.
5739354	5741594	And of course, I want to bring this up again on the podcast a little later.
5742014	5744635	Oh, speaking of tonight's podcast, damn, I said I would get this out at some point.
5744655	5749376	Tonight's podcast is going to be the winner, because we have not one, but two interviews on tonight's podcast.
5749436	5750056	It's going to be cool.
5750696	5752637	We're actually going to be doing a follow-up.
5752677	5759718	I don't know if you guys heard about this, but King's Quest 9, there was this fan project going on to create a fan version of King's Quest.
5760018	5760799	Thanks for watching!
5775253	5775673	Thanks for watching!
5794645	5796227	KQIX as they call it for short.
5796267	5796907	So tune into that.
5797428	5805876	But also, this is something I probably will address on the podcast as well, but I have to bring this up on the live show because I get more time to rant here than I do on the podcast.
5806216	5807818	And that has to do with Xbox 360.
5807918	5811201	Now, Loki, you were saying that you're going to be getting yours on launch day.
5811601	5815645	Well, every day I kind of question that more and more just because
5816167	5839775	of what Microsoft's doing, they're trickling in the allocation, so it's like, okay, X store, you had 200 Xboxes, thank you for pre-selling all those, we're gonna send you 10, you know, or like, you know, stuff like that, it's just really ridiculous, the store I booked mine at is not as busy as the other store that I used to, the GameStop I used to pre-book stuff at was in the mall,
5840259	5842541	You know, high traffic GameStop and stuff.
5842601	5845162	And it was a bitch and a half to try to get anything from them.
5845542	5850466	So now I've booked stuff now at the GameStop that's only a couple blocks from my house.
5850526	5851286	It's really small.
5852647	5854849	There's never really anyone in there and that type of stuff.
5855149	5857891	So I'm hoping that there's not that many people that have booked them.
5858691	5862113	And I got in on one of the few that they've got.
5862313	5862614	But...
5863434	5869175	Even like some of the stores that hardly have any pre-orders for them, they're not getting hardly anything.
5869235	5871576	So it's really iffy.
5871616	5875417	Hopefully I am because I've got two games on order there and two on order at my work.
5875657	5878097	And so I'm really trying to get a lot of this stuff in.
5878117	5883478	Plus I'm trying to butter up the people we sell to, the publishers, to have them send me some free stuff.
5883519	5885239	But that's a whole other story.
5887253	5890357	I got to play an Xbox 360 kiosk finally.
5890517	5891498	Where's that at?
5891639	5892780	Best Buy has them.
5892980	5894782	Two of them in the area have the kiosk set up.
5895003	5896845	The one over by Birdcage has one.
5896865	5899068	That's where I played it yesterday.
5900409	5904534	They have demos of Cameo and Call of Duty 2.
5905055	5905576	And King Kong?
5906036	5906917	No, just those two.
5907137	5909159	Or at least those two were the only ones I noticed that were playable.
5909539	5911341	I know they had videos of a bunch of other ones, too.
5911381	5913443	I don't remember... King Kong's playable, usually.
5913643	5915425	But it might be a different disc, who knows.
5916066	5917607	Yeah, or I just missed it completely.
5917627	5920029	But I did notice specifically those two games were playable.
5920570	5924333	And I have to say, I was incredibly underwhelmed with Camp.
5924353	5926015	Cameo was the one I really paid attention to.
5926295	5930700	Call of Duty 2 had pretty graphics and stuff, but Cameo was a little bit underwhelming.
5931460	5937082	I can see where people are making these Xbox 1.5 comparisons where it just looks slightly better than the Xbox.
5937122	5938643	It's not that much better.
5938663	5941764	I'm surprised because Cameo was actually one of the ones I was pretty impressed with.
5941824	5945485	All the first party stuff seemed to be pretty good and Cameo was one of them.
5945505	5960270	I don't know if maybe the particular level or the sub that they have is not very forgiving to the game but the one that we saw they were showing kind of like the draw distance of the game and stuff and there was like hundreds and thousands of like these creatures just battling on the
5960710	5961611	and so on.
5991460	5993802	It's definitely going to be interesting.
5994122	5996463	The jury's out now for me.
5996583	6002866	I was completely sold on Xbox 360 and I wanted to pick one up on launch day, but now I'm not so sure I want to get one on launch day.
6003366	6007388	I don't know if I want to fight those crowds and stuff, so we'll see how that goes.
6008289	6013351	It's going to kind of depend on what mood I'm in that day, but after spending $70 on Guitar Hero, I don't know if I want to spend another $400 on Xbox, so we'll see.
6015532	6023194	Anyway, somebody in chat room asked me very nicely if they could call in because they had a story related to what we're talking about right now.
6023234	6024894	So I said, okay, I'll make an exception.
6024934	6025874	So who do we have on the line?
6026874	6028615	Hi, it's Sephiroth1215 here.
6028815	6030135	Hello, Sephiroth1215.
6030175	6032155	Now, what did you want to say in regards to Xbox 360?
6033776	6039017	I actually said briefly in the chat room before, but no one really responded, so I don't even know if people were paying attention.
6039137	6044698	We're trying to stay on top of it, but we also enjoy listening to ourselves talk, so it's kind of hard to stay on top of it sometimes.
6044718	6045358	I think I saw it.
6045865	6046145	Go ahead.
6047086	6051108	But yeah, I actually just went by a Toys R Us today, and I was able to reserve one.
6051208	6052769	Guaranteed to get it in the 22nd.
6053850	6055390	When did Toys R Us start doing reserves?
6055731	6056211	That's the point.
6056271	6057472	Everybody forgot about Toys R Us.
6057492	6062915	That's why I keep saying, go to Toys R Us, go to Target, and stuff like that, because no one remembers about Toys R Us.
6062935	6063995	But Target doesn't do reserves.
6064976	6067197	I know, but they're going to get their games in.
6067237	6068838	See, the systems are going to be in it at Target.
6069118	6072380	You have to be there at 6 in the morning, and they're basically going to go out there
6073398	6083325	it's first come first serve, the first people in line or whatever get this card that entitles them to buy the system and then they keep doing it until it's sold out and that's it
6085703	6088725	Loki, tell me, why should I buy an Xbox 360?
6089186	6089426	Why?
6090207	6093629	Why do I need one in two weeks or whenever the damn thing's coming out?
6093869	6098873	Well, personally, like me, I'm a consumer whore and I have to get it right when it comes out.
6098973	6102756	Just mainly the reason why I want to get it so I can review this stuff right.
6103317	6109622	Kind of try to get an edge on everything because I know we're not IGN, we're not GameSpot or anything like that.
6110102	6113905	And so having this console now as opposed to two months from now
6114577	6116859	It's important to me, so I need to get that stuff.
6117740	6128249	The other thing is, also, with the date of the PlayStation 3 kind of up in the air, the next system that we know is going to launch is going to be in June, which is the revolution.
6128329	6130511	That's, you know, almost seven months away.
6131051	6138037	I don't want to wait seven months, so, you know, I got to do that, and also Burnout's coming out in March, so... Oh, yeah, there's the real answer.
6138297	6139138	Okay, all right.
6139658	6142160	So, how much did they make you put down at Toys R Us for the Xbox 360?
6143844	6147547	Only 50, but the problem is you have to get a bundle.
6149108	6153552	So you have to get the, not the core, but the... I keep forgetting the name.
6153572	6155894	There's core and there's... Just Xbox 360.
6156314	6158055	The plus, the plus pack or whatever.
6158075	6158375	Just 360.
6158456	6165961	Hold on, I mean, of course you have to get the premium version, which is alright anyway, because that's going to be the harder one to find.
6166562	6172907	And cores are going to be probably pretty easy, but still... Wait, are they making you get games with it too?
6173939	6174459	Yeah.
6175519	6177200	I heard a rumor about this now.
6177260	6183582	Wasn't there something on Slash Thought about how Microsoft was like forcing retailers to make sure people walk out the door with two games or something like that?
6183602	6195485	Well, you're going to have to because in order for them to be guaranteed to get them in, they have to guarantee that they're going to do $10 million with Microsoft in like, I want to say the next year or in the next few months.
6196286	6200787	So $10 million, you're going to have to push those games like big time.
6201109	6207551	I just, I, honestly, the more and more I hear, the less and less I want to support this system on the launch day, because I don't like their tactics.
6208671	6215753	I realize it's all business, and it's just, you know, trying to make money and stuff, and trying to, you know, sell as many as they can before Christmas, but honestly, there's got to be a better way of doing it.
6215773	6219414	The whole thing is, though, is they're trickling them out so they can say, oh yeah, it sold out on the first day.
6219714	6224095	Well, yeah, if you put out half the amount that you're supposed to put out, of course it's going to sell out, morons.
6224175	6251434	but the gamer community is well aware of what Microsoft's trying to play with us and the average consumer does not follow the game industry and they don't know better the average consumer is not going to be waiting at 6 o'clock in the morning out front of Target when Lil Billy wants to get his fucking Xbox 360 for Christmas you better damn well believe people are going to be waiting in line for these things they're fighting over I mean look at Tickle Me Elmo that thing is fucking retarded but people went out and bought them got in riots it's retarded but that's what it is
6252615	6252855	and so on.
6270509	6273171	Yeah, because, you know, they're really known for gaming in their PCs.
6273251	6277394	If Apple and Nintendo teamed up, I swear to God, it would be a force to beat.
6277654	6282938	Apple and Nintendo, if they teamed up, they're the masters of getting people to buy the same shit over.
6282998	6284720	I mean, look at what Apple just fucking did.
6285020	6288142	They released an iPod, and then they said, no, no, no, no, you've got to have an iPod Color.
6288222	6289964	No, no, no, no, no, you've got to have an iPod Shuffle.
6290004	6291024	No, no, no, no, wait, an iPod Nano.
6291044	6292706	No, no, no, no, wait, we've got one that plays videos.
6292906	6293847	They played a Nintendo.
6294327	6294787	Exactly.
6295308	6296829	Apple and Nintendo, a match made in heaven.
6297249	6298010	Tell me it shouldn't happen.
6299384	6299785	I agree.
6299985	6300285	I should.
6300605	6306190	Okay, sorry Sephiroth, we're just making you listen to our rants there, but... That's alright.
6306691	6309473	I think Loki's pretty much completely right on this one, though.
6310454	6318922	Yeah, I hate to say it, but I know Loki's right on this one, but it doesn't piss me off any less, though.
6319002	6323446	I see what you mean, but us gamers have to get it when we can anyway, so... I know.
6323567	6324848	Anything else you want to share with our listeners?
6326572	6344635	Uh, yeah, I mean, I realize getting a bundle isn't too bad, because even with the games that it's coming with, it's three games, and I could just go back to another Toys R Us, or go to a Walmart and return for credit without a receipt, so it's not too bad.
6344735	6345655	Now that's thinking.
6345996	6347076	I like the way this guy thinks.
6347136	6347756	Smart idea.
6347796	6352757	If you don't want to have to buy these, forced to buy these games or whatever, then just buy them and take them back to another store.
6353057	6353777	Beautiful idea.
6353837	6354257	I like it.
6356072	6356372	All right.
6357112	6358493	Well, thank you so much for calling in.
6358533	6363615	We're going to try and get past this topic soon enough, but we appreciate your perspective and letting us know about Toys R Us.
6363655	6365696	That's a good FYI.
6365736	6368757	And somebody in chat suggested Circuit City, which I think is another good idea.
6368957	6370318	Everybody forgets about Circuit City.
6370778	6374660	And also, there's some other places that you would never think to book a 360, that one being Kohl's.
6378061	6382064	I didn't even know Kohl's carried electronics, let alone having 360s.
6382504	6383625	Kohl's is one of them.
6384366	6386968	Also, like I mentioned before, Target and Best Buy.
6387028	6395054	Best Buy they're saying is going to have a lot more because apparently Bill Gates is going to be whoring the Xbox 360 out at one of the Best Buys in Manhattan.
6395074	6396655	That's the rumor, at least.
6396795	6401599	And because of that, there's a deal now where they're going to be getting a larger allocation over everybody else.
6402239	6404340	Suckin' Microsoft's Cock for more Xboxes.
6404440	6404861	Beautiful.
6405721	6413406	And, um, basically, yeah, just a lot of these, you know, sores that everybody forgets about, just go check them and see if you can get a 360 there.
6413766	6414727	Fucking Kohl's?
6415007	6415347	Kohl's.
6415427	6419810	I can walk out of there with, um, an Xbox 360 and new... And a hoe!
6419970	6420931	And new underwear.
6424553	6424893	And a hoe.
6424913	6427475	But yeah, for when I soil my pants at Dead or Alive 4.
6427975	6428536	Yes, anything else?
6429465	6434967	But honestly, yeah, it will be possible to get one by this launch day, I'm sure, if you just try hard enough.
6435067	6436288	It's not too hard.
6437028	6445152	So, I mean, if people rush out the Toys R Us, like, tomorrow, I'm sure you might be able to get one, a reserve, but there's still going to be limited quantities.
6446232	6454781	and also I say don't listen to the people at EB or GameStop because all they ever tell me is, no, you can't go anywhere else.
6455282	6466273	And I took off my money from my reserve at EB today and they laughed at me saying you're not going to be able to get it because I guess they're told that the only reserve for them and the only way you're going to be able to get it is through them.
6467154	6468715	Thanks for watching!
6496030	6498753	All right, anyway, appreciate that call there.
6498973	6501435	Got us on a little bit of a rant about Xbox 360.
6502036	6505379	Now, this I think is really interesting, and Loki, I saw you had this up earlier.
6505419	6512086	Can you go back to 1up.com and their story about the, oh, you already had it, great, the Xbox 360 versus the Dreamcast?
6512266	6512366	Yeah.
6512406	6519212	I think this article is so hilarious where they compare the Dreamcast, which, you know, Dreamcast...
6520240	6525869	It didn't succeed, but it wasn't because it was a bad system, because Dreamcast actually had a lot of good stuff on it.
6526249	6531257	Phantasy Star Online was revolutionary, and the little... What was the thingy called?
6531277	6531858	The VMU?
6532258	6534081	That could have its own games on it?
6534622	6535644	That stuff was revolutionary.
6536024	6537945	But unfortunately, the Dreamcast didn't succeed.
6538205	6542087	So it's interesting to see them drawing comparisons to the Dreamcast and the Xbox 360.
6542487	6543987	So this article is over on 1up.com.
6544247	6547309	Loki, read us like five or so comparisons here between Dreamcast and 360.
6548309	6551631	Launched the year before the competition, and that's the same on both.
6551831	6552831	Okay.
6553391	6554112	Let's see here.
6554832	6558974	Had a sleek white console following the footsteps of a bulky black console.
6559614	6562095	Now, technicality though, my Xbox is green.
6563172	6563853	The Little Swirly
6584176	6584776	That's creepy.
6585397	6586077	Let's see here.
6586997	6592680	We've also got Promise to be an evolutionary system to someday play DVDs.
6592760	6597002	It says, Promise to be an evolutionary system someday to play HD DVDs.
6597883	6598223	Interesting.
6598383	6602845	Now, Dreamcast did end up supporting DVDs eventually, didn't they?
6603045	6603605	No, they never did.
6603905	6604486	No, they never did?
6604526	6605306	You know why I'm confusing it?
6605326	6606347	Because you could play VCDs.
6606367	6608187	You could download things from the internet to play VCDs.
6608608	6609208	I'm confusing it.
6609508	6616077	And then, of course, one of my favorites is, for the Dreamcast, Metal Gear Solid 2 trailer stole much of its next generation thunder.
6616477	6621384	And then for the Xbox 360, Metal Gear Solid 4 trailer stole much of its next generation thunder.
6622438	6623678	It'll be interesting to see what happens.
6624099	6641784	But then they go into another, now there's a spin-off article, now it's not all, you know, they're not trying to say Xbox 360 is going to definitely, you know, fade away like the Dreamcast did, but they do say that there's things that the Xbox 360 has going for it that the Dreamcast did not.
6642484	6646105	There's like a sequel to the article also on the site, so check those out.
6646125	6647466	There's a whole, a lot of stuff that...
6648755	6659883	You know, personally, it's just the people that are going to be buying it aren't smart enough to, like, say, okay, Microsoft, you know, you're really holding back your allocations, you know, that's kind of pissing me off, I'm going to go buy something else.
6660444	6661224	People aren't going to do that.
6661244	6664046	They're just going to be like, well, I'm going to wait, you know, or something.
6664086	6666288	Because it's the first system next gen that's coming out.
6667373	6670415	The system is only as good as the games on it.
6694042	6696544	Xbox 360, though, has some pretty good games on it.
6697185	6708755	I'm most excited... I will give them a lot... They're launching better this time because they actually have something on it that is not a fighting, a driving, or sports title on it.
6709015	6718643	They have, you know, like Cameo, and they have some other, you know, interesting titles around launch, the Elder Scrolls and stuff, so it's nice to see variety in their launch titles this time.
6718843	6719664	No, no, no.
6719884	6720525	They have Cameo.
6722369	6727973	Well, on the actual launch day they have cameo, but they have Elder Scrolls, you know, not that far out, right?
6728073	6728353	April.
6728893	6731235	And then King Kong is a little bit different, too.
6731635	6732095	Give it that.
6732195	6736978	It's a first-person shooter still, sort of.
6736998	6742562	It's not much of a... Okay, well, anyways, yeah, so they're coming out with some more stuff later.
6743396	6743696	All right.
6744096	6745036	We're going to go to a break, guys.
6745056	6748317	When we come back from this break, the long promised, we said we were going to do it all night.
6748337	6749917	We're going to get to it listless.
6749937	6751097	We haven't done this segment in a long time.
6751257	6752878	You said we were going to do it all night.
6753458	6754558	Do it all night.
6755038	6757558	No, we're not going to hear that song in this break because I don't want to hear Erotic tonight.
6759019	6760319	But I do want to hear this request.
6761039	6761279	Angel?
6763059	6764640	You don't want to listen to Erotic tonight?
6764840	6765080	What?
6766180	6766640	I told you.
6766720	6767300	I'm in a mood.
6767340	6768620	I'm in this emo mood tonight.
6768660	6769340	I don't know what it is.
6770161	6772001	Well, then go scare them with emo or something.
6772878	6779542	Well, no, I'm actually going to be a good co-host, and I'm going to play a request that somebody requested in our chat room.
6779562	6780743	And that was for some Captain Jack.
6781224	6783005	So we're going to do some Captain Jack starting off this break.
6783305	6787648	And we'll be back with tonight's list list regarding Guitar Hero 2, hypothetically.
6787808	6789809	Of course, it hasn't been announced yet, but come on.
6790590	6791030	Come on.
6791430	6793452	All they have to do is make their money back, and there'll be a Guitar Hero 2.
6793492	6794232	There's got to be one.
6794252	6795513	All right, we'll be back after this.
6795533	6798375	We'll start it off with some Captain Jack fifth mix style, yo.
6882296	6883396	Thank you for watching!
6938161	6939192	Thanks for watching!
7206820	7226405	Welcome back boys and girls to Orange Lounge Radio and I bet you kids are dying to know who won tonight's cage match because we had the votes tallied.
7227366	7228826	So, tonight's winner...
7229773	7232974	It was a very, very, very close vote, by the way.
7233054	7234835	Like all three songs, neck and neck and neck.
7235335	7239417	In fact, tonight's vote was so close, we have a tie.
7239777	7241418	A tie in tonight's cage match.
7241958	7243479	So here are the songs that are tied.
7243519	7249282	The first song that's tied tonight is... Depeche Mode with Precious.
7251583	7254344	And the second song that is tied tonight is...
7258533	7261715	Nine Inch Nails with Old Wings.
7262195	7264676	So apparently the chatroom is feeling very emo too.
7264956	7268918	Although there were quite a few votes for song number two, just not enough unfortunately.
7269298	7275582	So going to the cage match rulebook, the way we break a tie, the host who picked the song that did not tie gets to break the vote.
7275662	7277382	So Loki, which song's gonna win?
7277482	7277983	Depeche Mode.
7278383	7280624	Depeche Mode wins tonight's cage match.
7281424	7283105	Any particular reason why you went for that one?
7283586	7284766	I don't know, I just like Depeche Mode.
7285767	7286167	Fair enough.
7287313	7289355	It was the most emo of the two.
7290676	7291816	You mean most emo-ist?
7292677	7293017	Yeah.
7293358	7297381	That's what next week I'm wrapping up.
7297401	7297961	Mamma Mia?
7298561	7298722	No.
7299082	7299822	Oh, can't wait.
7300103	7302865	Actually, no, I won't be here next week, so yeah, Mamma Mia will be in the cage match.
7303430	7306353	Okay, in two weeks we'll look forward to it.
7306473	7307294	I won't even be here.
7308515	7309236	Living it up!
7309616	7313060	You're going to be at the, well, the Gay Frat House doesn't exist anymore.
7313140	7314301	The Gay Frat House is gone.
7314441	7315001	That's too bad.
7315902	7317364	I will be living it up in SoCal.
7318825	7324030	Where my harem of adoring math players will be waiting for me.
7324050	7324771	This is next week?
7325972	7327474	Are you going to go see Harry Potter down there?
7331236	7333737	I thought it was the week after, how dare you?
7333757	7334337	Make my heart stop
7353200	7357662	Speaking of which, I have nobody to go with because, um... You can come with us.
7357962	7359863	Temagus doesn't like Harry Potter.
7359883	7361224	You can come with us and screw him.
7362064	7362444	Okay.
7362864	7364385	Anybody want to come kidnap me?
7365365	7367847	Don't, like, literally screw him, but, you know.
7368987	7371748	Uh, I don't do that anyway, you sicko.
7371768	7373549	Alright, anyway.
7374350	7378852	Um, no, but DarkSakura's going to be gone next week for a legitimate business purpose, right?
7378872	7379692	Tell them where you're going to be.
7379712	7380952	To meet my adoring fans!
7381193	7381673	Where at?
7382702	7384643	at the Podcast Awards, alright?
7384764	7387125	DarkSakura's gonna be representing us at the Podcast Awards.
7387165	7390748	I'm going to be there in all of my, in all of my, uh, dark glory.
7391428	7394270	I didn't go because he wouldn't give me any, like, time on the mic.
7394290	7403257	He'd be like, thank you for, and then I would just, and then Loki would get to go up there and go, it's so much fun, and then get cut off.
7404278	7405518	I'm going to say, give me a dollar!
7405558	7406779	And he goes sit down.
7427355	7428956	Don't embarrass us, DarkSakura.
7430117	7430817	I never do.
7431317	7433038	It's a fair representation of the show.
7433118	7435180	Could you please thank my mother while you're down there?
7436180	7437501	I thank your mother.
7440022	7441983	I'd like to thank your mom.
7443804	7444145	All right.
7444705	7448307	We're going to get into tonight's list very shortly, but I do want to give a little bit of a reminder.
7448407	7450248	Ultramix 3, right around the corner.
7450628	7452349	Ultramix 3's got a damn impressive lineup.
7452369	7453810	Is that out this Tuesday, I think?
7453910	7454331	Next week.
7454411	7454791	Next week?
7455855	7458618	I heard it was leaking early, I don't know.
7460359	7463882	I swear to God, again I'm going to go broke before my birthday, right Rob?
7464443	7471689	You also have that same week, Flow, the Urban Dance Uprising, in case you feel a little bit like a breakbeat mood and you have the extra money to waste on stuff.
7471749	7479155	Yeah, like I said, Ultramix 3 is coming out, and I know a lot of you guys are going to buy Ultramix 3, and you wouldn't want to buy any other dancing game except Ultramix 3 that day.
7481317	7481677	All right.
7482518	7484460	Oh, I wanted to mention something about DDR and Mario, too.
7484500	7485661	I keep putting off the list list.
7485681	7489865	But DDR and Mario, there's been tournaments going on, like, everywhere.
7489925	7491306	There was actually one here in Sacramento.
7491326	7492207	I don't know if you guys heard of this.
7492727	7493368	I didn't go.
7493468	7496350	However, I heard that a whopping five people entered the tournament.
7496891	7499834	So congratulations to whoever won out of those five people.
7499854	7500354	Was it?
7500374	7501955	A free copy of Mario DDR.
7501996	7502716	Was it Andrew?
7503277	7503697	I don't know.
7503837	7504958	No, I don't think it was him that won.
7504978	7505639	I think it was somebody else.
7507256	7509181	I don't know who won, but I know who posted about it.
7511305	7512147	Uh, yeah, explicit.
7512248	7512909	Anyway, yeah.
7513851	7514453	I don't know who won.
7514834	7515675	We'll have to find out from him.
7517014	7522158	I'm sure they did a fabulous job and earned their Mario DDR, which is a game I don't think I'm going to buy.
7522699	7525161	Honestly, I'm not feeling the Mario DDR.
7525181	7529484	I love Nintendo, I love DDR, but I'm not feeling the Mario DDR.
7530625	7531886	I know it would last five minutes.
7532286	7534088	The honeymoon would be over before it begins.
7534868	7537631	Hey, well, you know what you have to steal your money instead?
7538331	7538812	Mario Party 7.
7540083	7545266	Okay, I'll go with that, because I love playing Mario Party 7, because I'm an evil bitch when I play as Peach in that game.
7545606	7546707	I'm a vindictive motherfucker.
7546727	7551490	They need DS Mario Party, so we can get some Wi-Fi going.
7551510	7554492	I heard that was a rumor, something that was in development, was the DS Mario Party.
7555352	7556033	We'll see, though, we'll see.
7556053	7560356	Because think about all the mini-games, because the mini-games are starting to get a little stale, but think about all the new stuff they could do with the pen.
7560776	7560936	Yeah.
7560956	7561416	It'd be fun.
7562857	7565179	All right, let's get into tonight's listless.
7566820	7567280	All right.
7568928	7581358	The way that Listless works, because it's been a hell of a long time since we've done one of these segments, what we're going to do is each of us here in studio, so it would be the three hosts, myself, DarkSakura, and Loki, and then our special guest, Angel, because Bug left.
7581398	7582819	He decided to go watch Family Guy or something.
7583880	7586181	We're each going to put in three...
7587122	7588603	Subtitles by Subtitle Workshop
7602790	7606632	And then we come up through this highly scientific process we call listless of the top three songs we want to see in Guitar Hero 2.
7624577	7624837	All right.
7625558	7627158	So that being said, let's start it off.
7627218	7627999	Everybody ready to go?
7628039	7628859	Got their three songs?
7629059	7630040	There we go.
7630240	7630500	All right.
7630640	7632561	Angel, you're lowest on the totem pole.
7632681	7633482	You start us off.
7635082	7635703	Just messing with you.
7635723	7638544	What's your number three pick?
7642746	7643847	Anything from Dragon Force.
7644667	7645468	You guys are like, huh?
7647837	7650119	Okay, Dragon Force is like a metal band.
7650900	7652001	I don't know what it is.
7652041	7653663	I think they're from like Norway or something.
7653823	7654644	Go ahead.
7655725	7657747	As Rob opens, oh, never mind.
7658247	7659708	As Rob types in stuff.
7660829	7662771	I thought it was like going on to Google or something.
7663232	7663932	Give me a song.
7663972	7665474	Give me any song that Dragon Force did.
7668021	7668643	I forgot.
7668984	7669986	Praise something.
7670026	7670387	Whatever.
7670487	7670808	Anyway.
7671109	7673674	It's like some of their new ones that nobody knows about yet.
7674055	7674777	It's the first song.
7675298	7677042	Um, somebody wanna google that?
7677062	7677623	Go ahead.
7678553	7681355	All right, anything by Dragon Force, first thing on tonight's list.
7681856	7683417	We'll go over, I'll go next.
7683837	7689742	My number three pick for tonight's list list is the song Bitch by Meredith Brooks.
7690143	7692565	And I don't know if you remember this song from the 90s, it was kind of a one-hit wonder.
7693085	7693866	I'm a bitch.
7694506	7703133	I actually met this woman once, she was really nice, and she actually is a really good guitar player, and that's something people never really picked up about her, but she's inspired by Hendrix and all those people.
7703373	7706376	She's a really good guitar player, and I just want to play Bitch.
7706736	7707957	on Guitar Hero, that would rock.
7708017	7710359	So that's my pick for number three song.
7710699	7711079	Loki.
7712440	7716863	My number three song is going to be Kenny Loggins with Danger Zone.
7718424	7723327	That song, granted, it's really cheesy and stuff, but it's really a good guitar song.
7725289	7726990	Is that the same one from Top Gun?
7727010	7729251	Yep, that would be the same one from Top Gun.
7729652	7732093	Alright, DarkSakura, that's the queen of the show, you get to go last.
7732814	7735616	Number three, ACDC, Highway to Hell.
7740487	7741908	I am throwing up the horns as we speak.
7742108	7743289	Now we're fucking talking.
7743369	7744270	Highway to Hell.
7746571	7757238	Although I can't fucking stand that guy's voice.
7758199	7759240	I love the guitar.
7759780	7761921	So that would be a badass song to play in Guitar Hero.
7761961	7762862	I definitely support you.
7762882	7764623	I will not take that off the list, I guarantee you.
7765044	7767065	Alright, let's go around to the number two picks.
7768806	7769947	Angel, what's your number two pick?
7771087	7777668	Pearl Jam, uh, either, oh hell, okay fine, Alive.
7780969	7788330	That's a good band to have in Guitar Hero, Pearl Jam, we kind of missed them in the last one, so okay, Alive by Pearl Jam, Angel's number two pick, good pick.
7788610	7789631	Loki, what's your number two pick?
7790551	7796052	Um, my number two pick, what was it, toss up, um, Filter with Hey Man Nice Shot.
7796632	7797132	Alright.
7804304	7807126	Is it true that that song's about some guy that killed himself or something?
7807146	7807806	I have no idea.
7808567	7809827	Eh, Curcumin?
7811328	7812709	No, that's tasteless.
7813770	7814550	I shit you not.
7816011	7817452	Wow, alright.
7817532	7824896	My number two pick, my number two pick for a song that should be in Guitar Hero 2 would be Are You Gonna Go My Way by Lenny Kravitz.
7825537	7828158	Because that song's badass and it has a great guitar riff in it.
7828178	7829339	Are you gonna go my way?
7829679	7830760	So I'm gonna do that.
7830800	7832121	Are You Gonna Go My Way by Lenny Kravitz.
7835151	7836592	DarkSakura, your number two pick.
7837953	7840514	I'm going... God damn this stupid thing.
7842716	7851241	I'm going to have to go with Metallica, and I've had a hard time narrowing it down, because there's just a whole bunch of fucking good Metallica songs.
7851942	7862909	So I'd have to say... Yeah, actually, I'm going to have to go with Master of Puppets.
7863314	7864154	Okay, thank you.
7864194	7866935	I'm glad you changed your mind at the last minute and decided not to do a newer song.
7866955	7869415	So Master of Puppets by Metallica.
7873556	7874096	Badass.
7874136	7875316	I'm liking this list so far.
7875336	7876436	We got some good shit on here.
7876456	7877777	We're going to rock out on Guitar Hero 2.
7878077	7879257	I hope Red Octane's listening.
7880797	7886198	Angel, your number one pick for song you most want to see in fucking Guitar Hero 2.
7887738	7889339	I'm going to scare you guys with this one.
7890979	7891979	Rainbow with Stargazer.
7893985	7895866	Just cause like the guitar in that's pretty cool.
7896026	7897787	I have a massive question mark over my head.
7898887	7899188	Really?
7899728	7900468	Richie Blackmore.
7900608	7902569	Anyway, yeah, 1976, you don't want to know.
7903610	7906431	Okay, some classic stuff, some old classic stuff.
7907111	7908672	Stargazer by Rainbow.
7908912	7914575	Alright, Loki, your number one pick for song that oughta damn well better be in Guitar Hero 2.
7915195	7916976	Soundgarden with Black Hole Sun.
7922546	7923289	Nice pick.
7923330	7925619	Black Hole Sun by Soundgarden.
7925680	7926242	Good pick.
7928549	7929930	Spoonman would be good too.
7930630	7933551	If we could have had the video too, because that's one of my favorite videos of all time.
7933671	7934972	I mean, who doesn't love the Black Hole Sun video?
7934992	7941374	That'd be great, you know, if they could do it where they play the video in the background of the stage while they're doing the song.
7941394	7943255	Like on a big monitor.
7943415	7944556	In Amplitude they did that.
7944816	7945276	I remember.
7945476	7947697	You could see the Blink-182 video in that one song.
7947737	7948017	Cool.
7948517	7956520	Alright, my number one pick for song I would most want to see in Guitar Hero 2 would be More Human Than Human by White Zombie.
7956841	7957421	Shit, yeah.
7961112	7964095	I love that song, so we're gonna do More Human Than Human by White Zombie.
7965376	7966857	DarkSakura, your number one pick.
7968219	7970961	It was a really tough thing for me to think of.
7971261	7973784	However, I'm gonna go with Blur's song too.
7973804	7975886	The Woohoo one.
7976246	7978188	For the people who only know it as the Woohoo song.
7978648	7981791	I knew that Blur or Gorillaz would be on your list somewhere.
7981811	7983533	That's a good choice.
7983573	7985475	It doesn't matter, there's no other way.
7986215	7991078	Okay, but I think more people, of course, more people know, you know, woohoo, everybody knows that one, so.
7991759	7992659	Am I allowed to kill one?
7994380	7996042	No, I mean, yes.
7996342	7997563	Okay, what?
7997723	8005708	Change Dragonforce, I can't believe I said that, but change Dragonforce to Foo Fighters Everlong.
8005768	8007269	Oh, that's a good one.
8010563	8013206	Alright, so here's the list as it stands so far.
8013666	8031486	Everlong by Foo Fighters, Bitch by Meredith Brooks, Danger Zone by Kenny Loggins, Highway to Hell by ACDC, Alive by Pearl Jam, Hey Man Nice Shot by Filter, Are You Gonna Go My Way by Lenny Kravitz, Master of Puppets by Metallica, Stargazer by Rainbow,
8031826	8037832	Black Hole Sun by Soundgarden, More Human Than Human by White Zombie, Song 2 by Blur.
8038012	8038392	You know what?
8038432	8038653	Fuck.
8038693	8040434	Let's just send this to Red Octane and say this is what we want.
8040514	8041615	I mean, this is a great list right here.
8042356	8043197	This is an awesome list.
8043557	8050304	I do think that our top three, we actually should say, hey, all of the listeners of Orange Lounge Radio voted and want these songs in the next game.
8050484	8051905	You know what's interesting about this list, though?
8052265	8053206	No Nirvana.
8053627	8054768	We have Foo Fighters.
8054908	8055829	I was thinking it.
8057675	8058655	Oh, Roz mentioned it.
8058756	8061837	I almost put it in with, uh, Whitesnake, Here I Go Again.
8062197	8063317	Oh, so many good songs.
8063457	8063737	Yeah.
8063977	8066258	This can only be the beginning of many great songs.
8066278	8067459	There's many, many great songs.
8067619	8070980	Obviously, we missed some big ones, but these are the ones that are near and dear to our heart.
8071460	8080303	If this is gonna be tough, I know I say this every week, that it's gonna be tough to eliminate songs from the list, but tonight especially, this one is gonna suck, because this is a really good list, but we have to do it.
8080723	8081664	It's part of the game.
8082284	8083224	Let's start taking them off.
8083344	8083604	Angel.
8084725	8085105	Oh, no.
8087827	8093311	I'm just gonna have to take off Bitch.
8093331	8095332	It's just not as rocking as the rest of them.
8113829	8115750	I wasn't too attached to that song being there.
8115790	8117051	I just kind of had to throw that in there.
8117071	8117992	Because, you know, I'm a bitch.
8118172	8118652	I would have.
8118692	8121695	Yeah, so, my turn to take something off.
8123203	8129228	This is tough, and I apologize, but I kinda got the question mark with this song, too, and maybe it's just because I'm uncultured.
8129288	8132250	I have to take Stargazer by Rainbow off the list.
8132330	8133851	I just, I'm sorry, Angel.
8133871	8136093	No, that's fine.
8136373	8143719	Um, I can send you the song later, and you're probably gonna, like, kill yourself later, because you'll be like, ah, why did I take that off?
8144179	8145620	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
8174773	8177396	D&D Psy, Everlong
8195863	8214160	We have Highway to Hell by ACDC, Alive by Pearl Jam, Hey Man Nice Shot by Filter, Are You Gonna Go My Way by Lenny Kravitz, Master of Puppets by Metallica, Black Hole Sun by Soundgarden, More Human Than Human by White Zombie, and Song 2 by Blur.
8214521	8218324	Alright, send a private message to Sky with your vote.
8218665	8220006	And no bleached assholes!
8222247	8223328	You guys are fucked up.
8223788	8224368	Seriously.
8225149	8225929	Seriously fucked.
8225949	8227630	We have your roommate to blame for that, you know.
8227850	8228150	I know.
8228711	8229791	Bleached asshole.
8229952	8230172	Alright.
8230552	8234754	So we will reveal the definitive list a little later in the program.
8235015	8241939	And I will personally throw up on the doorstep of Red Octane if they ever put Korn or Slipknot in it.
8242759	8245340	Okay, Korn, I could deal with.
8245420	8249601	Korn's pretty cool until, like, until they hit MTV, Korn was very cool.
8249661	8252742	Like, Adidas, you know, All Day I Dream About... That was a cool song.
8253122	8258144	But, you know, when they kind of, you know, started being on MTV all the time, I didn't dig them so much.
8258544	8260165	But, no, Slipknot.
8260245	8260805	No, please, no.
8261165	8261665	Please, God, no.
8262145	8263886	However, Gwar would be awesome.
8265066	8266426	No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
8266547	8267027	Primus.
8268107	8269788	See, all these... Winona's a big down beaver.
8270388	8270968	Winona's...
8272179	8274040	Oh my god, I forgot about that song.
8274440	8275441	That song was badass.
8275521	8276021	No, no, no.
8276061	8279483	My ex-boyfriend in Alabama was like the world's biggest Primus fan.
8280403	8289728	So we would go down his Civic MRX, play in Primus at like downtown Mobile and all the old people would wake up.
8289928	8291589	Or just the theme song to South Park.
8294429	8295129	All right, anyway.
8295470	8298391	So those votes are coming in there into the chat right now.
8298991	8300272	Let's talk a little bit real quick.
8300292	8303433	We are going to take a quick break so we can allow all the votes to come in.
8303453	8308075	However, I want to definitely plug some of the spin-off programming here on Orange Lounge Radio.
8308555	8311477	And we'll start it off with Monday nights on the station.
8312137	8313618	Extifer, who's not here tonight.
8313638	8315138	He's spending some quality family time.
8315198	8316819	His sister's over, and I think they're watching a movie.
8317179	8318880	So Extifer has his show on Monday nights.
8318920	8320300	It's Extifer's Case of the Mondays.
8320821	8320921	And...
8321641	8327646	It'll definitely clear up any Monday blahs that you were having with his very frank and honest talk.
8327946	8331809	And last week on the show, he had John on the show last week.
8331849	8336393	And John has nothing... John doesn't even play games, really, although I did catch him playing Final Fantasy VI once.
8336713	8341597	But, you know, it's the show where they kind of talk about games, but they talk about cool stuff, too.
8341657	8345701	So if you just want to have a good time, Monday nights on the station is extra first case of the Mondays.
8345981	8348263	Now, Tuesday nights is also a very good time.
8348303	8349204	Why is that, DarkSakura?
8350246	8353687	DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
8379807	8381088	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
8403862	8406103	I read Fark's stories and Dig's stories too, okay?
8406323	8407244	Give me some credit.
8409265	8410025	But no, we have a good time.
8410705	8411265	I like my show.
8411445	8411745	It's fun.
8412166	8414987	So tune in Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday nights here on Orange Lounge Radio.
8415347	8417468	Thursdays and Fridays to come soon?
8418168	8418988	Maybe.
8419408	8419949	We'll see.
8420509	8421389	So, alright.
8421969	8422450	Any little comments?
8424650	8426131	Uh, maybe.
8427111	8427672	Maybe.
8427712	8428332	We'll see what happens.
8429514	8438658	Alright, so while we're finishing getting your votes, we would start the FUs of the week normally, but I don't want both those things to overlap each other with the private messages.
8438698	8439598	I can only handle so much.
8439878	8448902	So we're going to do a quick break, and then we're going to come back, reveal the winners of tonight's list list, and, so get those votes in now, and we're going to move into the FUs of the week, because I know y'all are angsty.
8449382	8456845	And DarkSakura has a new theme song for her FUs tonight, and I'll tell you what, it's probably the best damn FU theme song yet, I think.
8457185	8458446	It is, I forgot what I picked.
8459639	8461440	Well, you'll find out when we get back.
8462380	8464000	Or if you're nice, I'll tell you during the break.
8466741	8467842	So we'll be back after this.
8468702	8474524	In this break, I think what we're going to do is... You know, I had some people requesting this, even though we played it on last week's show.
8475224	8476764	This song is just so cool.
8476964	8479285	I don't know how you can not like this song.
8479705	8481606	So we have to give it its due.
8482386	8486527	And I apologize, though, because... Oh, shit.
8486588	8487868	If I can find it... Uh-oh.
8489738	8493119	We'll try to get to it during the break at some point.
8493500	8494420	I can't find it all of a sudden.
8494440	8495720	We'll be back.
8497161	8498101	How embarrassing is that?
8498201	8498462	Oh, well.
8499142	8502283	We'll try and get to that song, but in the meantime, you get some other songs.
8503644	8510006	We'll start it off with something from Ultramix 2, because we haven't played a lot of newer stuff tonight.
8510567	8514128	So we'll do an Ultramix 2 song, and we'll be back after this.
8514148	8516129	We're going to start it off with Toe Jam.
8517609	8518830	You're listening to Orange Lounge Radio.
8522708	8523649	Thanks for watching!
8554526	8555367	Thanks for watching!
8597778	8598623	Thanks for watching!
8642008	8646593	This is not dead air, it's just that this song has a very quiet opening, so you'll just have to deal with it a little bit.
8675669	8676610	Thanks for watching!
8688059	8703809	Old New York was once New Amsterdam Why they changed it I can't say People just liked it better that way So take me back to Constantinople No you can't go back to Constantinople Been a long time gone Constantinople, why did Constantinople get the works?
8704309	8706451	That's what it is about the church
8724833	8732940	Old New York was once New Amsterdam Why they changed it, I can't say You just liked it better that way!
8733040	8740566	Istanbul was Constantinople, now it's Istanbul My Constantinople got a long time gone But Constantinople, why did Constantinople get the works?
8741046	8743849	That's nobody's business but the Turks
8769367	8777293	So take me back to Constantinople No you can't go back to Constantinople Been a long time gone to Constantinople Why did Constantinople get the works?
8777773	8779555	That's nobody's business but the church
8791539	8792620	Thanks for watching!
8846397	8847558	Thanks for watching!
8896753	8900917	Let's listen in on an Orange Lounge Radio staff meeting.
8901137	8902839	Do we want to be staffed by Hollywood?
8902899	8903259	No!
8903360	8907043	Do we care what people think of us?
8907664	8909506	No!
8909526	8910967	Do we want people to kiss our ass?
8911427	8914350	Yes!
8915511	8917393	Extreme Bomani Radio.
8917593	8918234	That's us.
8918775	8920316	Orange Lounge Radio.
8923970	8925812	Alright, we're back in the list list.
8925992	8934599	We're about to reveal the definitive list as voted by you, the chatroom of the three songs you most want to see in Guitar Hero 2.
8934659	8936500	You guys ready for this?
8937181	8937981	What do you think won?
8938001	8938381	Any early guesses?
8946588	8947448	Apathetic people.
8948289	8949469	No Bleached Asshole Son?
8949549	8950529	Bleached Asshole Son.
8950549	8950970	We'll see.
8951690	8952210	Here we go.
8952350	8953231	Number three.
8953271	8956832	The number three pick you guys want to see in Guitar Hero 2.
8957432	8959913	Highway to Hell by ACDC.
8960053	8960654	Rock!
8962134	8965196	The number two song you most want to see in Listless.
8965976	8967897	Song 2 by Blurred.
8967917	8968237	Woohoo!
8970396	8981204	and then, yeah, literally, and the number one song you bitches wanna see in Guitar Hero 2 by a landslide, might I add, by a freaking landslide vote, Master of Puppets by Metallica.
8981305	8984207	I have the best taste in the whole freaking room.
8984227	8985348	I knew that would happen.
8986348	8990852	Yeah, by the way, all three on the list, yeah, those were all three of Jamie's picks.
8991112	8991733	Woo!
8992253	8994675	I bet the rest of us are wishing we knocked some of them out, huh?
8996156	8996516	Bitch.
8996737	8998338	Mine is an evil laugh.
9001394	9003536	You know what's funny is that it was in a different order.
9004377	9005739	So don't get too cocky over there.
9005799	9007421	Just only two songs were turned around.
9007441	9012146	This is because not everybody appreciates Blur the way I do.
9015290	9021577	Some other votes though too, you know, Are You Gonna Go My Way was a very, it was like a fourth, so you know, it wasn't all, it wasn't all Jamie.
9024045	9026086	DarkSakura, you changed your theme song yet again.
9037813	9039153	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
9073277	9074658	Murder!
9078280	9080781	Ah, this makes me feel mighty.
9082081	9086204	Um, my first FU goes toward migraines.
9086924	9087944	Yes, migraines.
9088345	9092607	Because it means that my brain is broken and they want me to go in for a CT scan.
9094423	9104707	An FU goes to the stuff they gave me to help with the slow, horrible migraines because, well, it makes me lightheaded and feel like I'm drunk without being drunk.
9105227	9108208	If I'm gonna feel drunk, I'll let the benefit of booze to feel drunk.
9111670	9112170	God.
9115171	9122854	An FU goes toward idiot drivers and people who decide to pull into my lane facing toward me.
9124370	9135603	Um, and Effie goes toward, uh, the McDonald's over here by Rob's house for being rather dumb.
9135623	9137626	You know what's funny is all three of us went there tonight.
9137706	9138507	I think that's hilarious.
9138787	9141450	And Effie to the ghetto family in front of me, because they really like ghetto.
9141510	9141570	Um...
9146164	9148807	A nephew toward me not having much time to do stuff.
9148907	9152351	Also a nephew to me not having the whole week to procrastinate on my homework.
9152892	9159720	So I have to do homework tonight, homework Monday, homework Wednesday, and get it all done before I leave Thursday.
9161542	9163224	But that means I get to enjoy myself all weekend.
9164246	9167007	An FU in Advance Tour to Grapevine before you get to L.A.
9167027	9169648	because that road is like crap.
9170228	9172509	And there'll probably be a forest fire or something stupid.
9173249	9175810	As there always is every time I go to L.A.
9176751	9178932	And then an FU to L.A.
9180132	9182033	freeway system in general because it sucks.
9183553	9187835	And the floating pockets of yellow smog that seem to be sentient.
9189993	9195037	Um, and an F you goes to my nose for draining into my throat, and I probably will have their guidance tomorrow.
9195257	9196518	Just thought I'd let everyone know.
9196538	9198059	Alright, I'm done.
9199340	9200501	Alright, Loki.
9203244	9208868	Anyways, um, first fuck you, McDonald's, for not being able to fill an order correctly.
9209713	9211635	I asked them for a two-cheeseburger meal.
9211755	9222363	Granted, I know that's not on their menu still, but it's still something that they offer, because I get it almost every day, at least every day this week, at the McDonald's that's by my house.
9222763	9223964	Fat Fatty McFatty.
9224625	9232251	Instead, they gave me this two McChicken meal thing, or two McChicken sandwiches and, like,
9233092	9257090	a medium fry and stuff, I'm like, um, no, this is not what I ordered, oh, well, we thought, we don't have a two cheeseburger meal, I'm like, well, where'd you get this two fucking McChicken thing, I don't even see McChicken on their fucking, maybe you should take the hint, that they're retarded, no, that's why I went back there and got my, my, uh, food, yeah, anyways, um, fuck you, the stupid people that are driving out there, it has,
9258001	9263482	I swear to God, you know, we're on the road today, and I see this dumb bitch, you know, she's kind of swerving in her lane.
9263782	9268483	It's because she's doing her fucking makeup and talking on a cell phone while driving on the freeway!
9269343	9270283	Dumb bitch!
9270303	9271384	You know what, that takes talent.
9271424	9274244	To do your makeup and talk on the cell phone and drive?
9274964	9275665	That's amazing.
9276685	9277825	She should have her hands cut off.
9277845	9282666	Back to the Babylonian days, all of a sudden.
9282806	9285106	Also, fuck you to Saw 2 for not being gory enough.
9285847	9287787	It was a very, you know, huge disappointment.
9288459	9289980	We passed for making movies.
9290000	9290361	Forget it.
9291481	9291681	What?
9292682	9292902	What?
9292942	9293223	Gory.
9293263	9295064	I don't want to give it away.
9295104	9296485	I didn't even see it, but I read all about it.
9296665	9298747	It sounded gross.
9300008	9300348	Anyways.
9300368	9301429	The opening sounded gross.
9302209	9303190	It wasn't gross.
9305432	9306673	It didn't show anything.
9307453	9307793	Whatever.
9309655	9310055	Anywho.
9311776	9312657	So, fuck that.
9312997	9313357	And then...
9315523	9331917	You know, fuck you Microsoft for potentially not allowing me to have a 360 on launch day, even though I pre-ordered mine way in advance and I have purchased games as well, um, that will be coming soon, so you know what, I will damn well, I better get my system, or heads will roll.
9332437	9332657	So.
9334218	9334519	That's it.
9335019	9338382	Heads will roll.
9338402	9340444	Alright, um, my FU time.
9344127	9344387	Whoops.
9345103	9346404	Sorry, I'm supposed to make it loud.
9348085	9349186	Ah, not that song, my song.
9350387	9352268	There we go.
9352528	9353629	I don't want no short dick man.
9353649	9353969	Alright.
9354750	9356251	Um, my FU's of the week.
9357312	9359033	FU to the fact that I feel like I'm getting sick.
9359053	9361915	Progressively throughout tonight's show, I felt my nose get more and more stuffy.
9362535	9366278	And a sore throat, which is not good when you're supposed to be talking for eight hours a day in front of people.
9366298	9367038	Uh-oh.
9367199	9368980	I'm gonna be fucked come next week.
9369080	9371462	It's a good thing I'm not in class tomorrow, otherwise I would cry.
9372363	9373224	but I get tomorrow off.
9373704	9380732	I'm making a stop by somewhere and getting coldies because coldies, the zinc brigade begins now.
9381866	9387588	Boomer, do not do more than 100 milligrams in a day or you can get zinc poisoning.
9387768	9392889	I know, I just, I'll keep it, that's gotta be like 10 of those drops though to get 100 milligrams.
9393509	9400931	Anyway, an F you to World of Warcraft for being all laggy, so I have to go buy more RAM, so either I'm getting an Xbox 360 or I'm getting more RAM.
9401571	9403952	But World of Warcraft is very pretty, I have to give it that.
9404352	9405352	My cameo wasn't that pretty.
9405572	9406352	More RAM.
9406993	9407753	Get more RAM.
9409478	9410298	For my World of Warcraft.
9411459	9413341	You're actually supporting my World of Warcraft addiction?
9414522	9416483	I guess, but RAM's good for everything.
9417544	9419025	It might be a benefit to show, too.
9419386	9424370	I'm having problems on the Rob Roberts show with the program I'm using, and I think it's because of a lack of RAM.
9424670	9425191	RAM's good.
9425431	9426211	RAM is very good.
9426692	9427172	I like RAM.
9427192	9428253	I guess that's enough.
9428313	9431576	F you to flu shots.
9435677	9438679	Because I miss them at my work, but not that I would get one anyway.
9438719	9440861	They swear up and down that flu shots do not make you sick.
9441121	9442742	I get sick every time I have a flu shot.
9443082	9444023	I know, it's total bullshit.
9444103	9445684	I always get sick whenever I get a flu shot.
9446785	9448125	I don't care what the doctor says.
9448145	9449226	That's time out for me.
9449406	9452869	You know, I get some time off work with a legitimate excuse.
9454390	9456571	If I'm not at work, it's an epidemic.
9457112	9459093	I mean, I don't mean to talk myself up, but damn.
9459733	9460334	I have to be there.
9461595	9464116	Anyway, let's move on to Angels FU of the Week.
9464457	9464597	And...
9468001	9469241	Well now hypothetically you could be bi.
9493926	9495547	I'm just kidding, I don't care.
9496428	9497829	I can't fire you, damn it!
9499450	9522226	Um, yeah, so, um, screw you because, um, no, I'm not, and neither are my friends, and neither are the two other people that were there with me that are also serving on this board, so you need to go find somebody, something else to do, rather, and, or get kicked out of the game, because I can get you to do that now, so bye!
9523147	9526612	And, um, FQ'd on having my computer break again, because that sucks.
9527453	9528996	Eh, I have to go fix that tonight.
9529616	9532881	Ah, other than that, I think I'm done.
9534563	9539671	Alright, let's go to the chatroom FUs and see what angst we have going on in chat tonight.
9541445	9546910	Nintendomaniac64 says, F you to Sky for not mentioning the pop vs soda argument like you said you would.
9547950	9549352	It's soda, there is no argument.
9550072	9553215	F you chat members for not commenting on my links I posted in chat.
9554036	9558559	F you guys for not mentioning the revolution in the Dreamcast Xbox 360 PS3 discussion.
9559060	9560261	Didn't Loki say it would be out?
9560701	9565125	You know, we would talk about the revolution if Nintendo would throw us a frickin' bone and give us more to talk about.
9565165	9568788	December 9th is when they're debuting some more info.
9569208	9573431	They said they're never going to show the games until they're actually playable.
9573671	9576473	Well then on December 9th is when we'll talk more about the revolution.
9576493	9583778	NintendoManiac64 says, F you to myself for doing certain illegal activities that involve games, emulators, and downloading.
9584158	9585739	Oh, did I just type that out to Skye?
9585759	9586259	Hee hee.
9587000	9589301	Actually, emulators are not illegal anymore.
9591503	9597606	There's a loophole that's basically stated that the emulators themselves are not illegal.
9597627	9598227	But the ROMs are.
9599471	9600131	Possibly, yes.
9601192	9609978	Roz says F you to my health teacher for telling the cast and crew of the play that we aren't allowed to turn on the stage lights anymore for practice because they use too much electricity.
9612519	9613620	Excuse me, that's stupid.
9613980	9617762	Goggle says F you to me for not calling in when I actually had something to say.
9618143	9620984	And F you to the AI in Soul Calibur 3 for being hard.
9621465	9621925	Seconded.
9622725	9623086	Seconded.
9623939	9626221	DarkSetsuya says a continued FU to Squeenix.
9626561	9629343	I was supposed to get my slime keychains and I haven't seen any sign of them.
9631545	9636769	SSJ100Matt says FU to my boss pulling in office space and making me come in Saturday and Sunday for senseless crap.
9637789	9643233	FU to my 4 year old Nvidia video card dying thus making me spend a whole $75 on a replacement.
9643794	9646136	But just remember, Friday is Hawaiian Shirt Day.
9647076	9647336	GS191...
9649178	9649638	That's a joke.
9650199	9650459	Get it?
9651119	9652000	Have you seen Office Space?
9652020	9653441	Yeah, that's right.
9653621	9653941	Forget it.
9654622	9658104	Actually, I also saw that movie with Yahoo Serious.
9660045	9661046	No, no, not him.
9661366	9661966	Carrot Top!
9662667	9663808	What does it mean with Carrot Top?
9664228	9664568	I don't know.
9665008	9668030	I don't watch any movies with Carrot Top in them.
9668110	9671353	I caught it because I had to watch it because it was an E3.
9672500	9673601	Can I do a tangent real quick?
9673821	9674401	Okay.
9674962	9679065	My coworker called and left a voicemail for my other coworker, and it was very hilarious.
9679085	9679745	I got to hear this too.
9680025	9686690	He used the soundboard from E-bombs World to leave this office space message saying, Yeah, we're going to need you to come in on Saturday.
9686910	9687811	Did you get the memo?
9688231	9688771	Really funny.
9689211	9689732	Really funny.
9690232	9691613	And so I'm going to call and leave him a Ms.
9691633	9692154	Cleo message.
9692174	9693174	Cleo Wednesday, that was it.
9693534	9693655	Yeah.
9694035	9694735	Luau Wednesday.
9695076	9695676	Luau Wednesday.
9698004	9705629	More, GS191 says F you to the Xbox 360 kiosk for crashing and giving me the black screen of death and F you to my online math class.
9706049	9707850	Well, it's nice to know some things in Microsoft never change.
9708791	9716336	Dark Knight says F you to a customer today at my job that went nuts today just because we wouldn't exchange her year old leaf blower for a new one because it broke down.
9718049	9720232	Jazz says, F you to the Xbox 360.
9720573	9725339	I saw a demo of you at Best Buy and you lagged more than my computer that was on the verge of its HD exploding.
9725700	9727743	Why must you keep making yourself look worse and worse?
9729471	9740178	LegendOfZaku says, F you to the asshole customers I have to put up with in my tech help desk job here on campus, thinking that they know how we do shit so they bitch and moan when we tell them that we don't go to people's dorms to fix their PCs.
9740758	9744400	In other words, they are too lazy to bring down their PC to our office for fixin'.
9744901	9747642	F you to Hollywood in general for drowning us with shitty remake movies.
9747902	9750684	You're unoriginal, so get off of your asses and give us some original shit.
9752485	9755747	LegoGuitar says, F you to anyone who sucks.
9756247	9758409	I'm in too much of a good mood to think of anything specific.
9759793	9764717	And lastly, Sakurina says, F you to me because I still haven't unlocked everything on EX2 because I suck.
9765217	9767999	And F you to Krista Berg for invading Quebec.
9770201	9770521	One more.
9770962	9774124	Ron Chan says, F you to my... I think it's boss, not booze.
9774244	9777767	F you to my boss who decided to show up at my house 30 minutes ago with my paycheck.
9780589	9781490	At least you got money out of it.
9782751	9783231	Alright.
9784332	9788415	Thank you for your angst, chatroom, you angsty, angsty individuals.
9791585	9796627	I want to mention, vote for us, a 5 in your player window, on your live 365 player window.
9796647	9802770	Your votes saying that we are a good station really helps us in getting the word out about Orange Lounge.
9802850	9810413	Also, be sure to visit PodcastAlley.com and Podcast.Yahoo.com and vote for our podcast there, because the more votes we get, the cooler we are.
9812014	9819097	There's actually a thread in our forums on OrangeLoungeRadio.com that says how you can help promote, and so we appreciate all the help that you guys give us.
9821875	9823456	One other thing I want to mention for you guys.
9823796	9823896	Oh!
9824256	9825677	I missed, I'm sorry, there's one more.
9826478	9826818	Shit!
9826998	9827999	There's one more FU here.
9829579	9830480	I better get to the music here.
9832791	9834791	MPQ says F you to Sony.
9835432	9837892	So you know about those retarded DRM CDs.
9838292	9841493	Yeah, it's not enough that they fuck up people's computers and not care about it.
9841813	9843033	Who knows what a rootkit is?
9843373	9846194	The dumbest thing is that this has nothing to do with piracy at all.
9846514	9848174	It's a pissing contest against Apple.
9848434	9850275	Yes, nothing to do with stopping piracy at all.
9850555	9852695	Sony's just pissed because the iPod's beating them.
9852995	9853795	Fuck you, Sony.
9853995	9855096	You're being fucking idiots.
9855376	9856716	And you lost my business.
9860097	9861037	Better late than never, right?
9861297	9861517	Alright.
9863154	9867740	I want to bring up something that was on the OrangeLoungeRadio.com website earlier this week.
9867780	9868961	I think this is kind of interesting.
9869282	9871484	Konami is launching a new campaign
9872383	9873384	I thought this was interesting.
9873404	9879028	They've launched a brand new website, and it's called Music in Every Direction.
9879908	9890956	And we're not really sure what the fuck this is supposed to be, but it is a promo device, absolutely, at least, for DDR Extreme 2, Karaoke Revolution Party, and DDR Ultramix 3.
9891737	9892518	And you can check this out.
9892578	9894419	It's musicineverydirection.com.
9894719	9896961	And all that's there right now are little bitty pictures.
9897461	9905926	of all those games, and enter your information below to stay up to date on the latest Konami music games and receive notification when the official website opens.
9908047	9914971	So I'm not sure, so I guess, oh, some people are saying they saw a commercial on TV, so is this like their marketing campaign, how they're going to market all these games?
9915351	9916492	Loki, you know anything about this?
9916552	9919234	You posted this to our website, so I thought maybe you'd know.
9919554	9920735	I didn't post this to our website.
9920775	9921315	I thought you did.
9921415	9922496	Who did?
9922556	9923036	Oh, damn it.
9924158	9924718	Copy that.
9924758	9925178	Something else.
9925399	9925679	Oh, well.
9926639	9927980	So I guess it's on TV.
9928280	9930381	I guess I don't watch enough TV because I haven't seen these commercials.
9930401	9930981	I haven't seen it either.
9931081	9939525	I didn't... During Elimidate, I saw the Guitar Hero with Loki and Dark Sakura commercial, but I did not see the commercial.
9939565	9940045	Yeah, anyway.
9940405	9940885	Oh, goody.
9941526	9942666	I'm just waiting for that.
9943226	9945387	I know they're going to... You know who I'm buying Guitar Hero with?
9946388	9946628	Hmm.
9946928	9948749	My best buy bucks from McDonald's.
9949109	9949849	Hell yes.
9951290	9952951	I have $31 of that stuff now.
9953171	9953651	Interesting.
9955415	9960878	Plus $15 from the puppies, because I bought all three of them and they gave me the file.
9961578	9963699	Yeah, I only have to pay like three bucks for the whole thing.
9964379	9965160	Not bad, not bad.
9965640	9967701	Alright, now I'm curious, what the fuck is this website you're on?
9967721	9969262	Because it's moving by itself.
9969482	9971423	It's like, it's a ghost thing.
9971643	9973484	It looks like fridge magnet poetry.
9973564	9974644	What the fuck is this site you're on?
9975024	9975785	Oh, this is nothing.
9975805	9980387	This is just some retarded viral campaign that no one cares about for the 360 that it has.
9981954	9983955	Okay, I can sum this up the best way.
9984056	9995343	It's like people were talking about, you know when Isle of Bees came out and stuff, that was cool because viral campaigning was kind of unseen and alternate reality gaming was kind of like brand new.
9996384	9998866	Now when everybody does it, it's not cool anymore.
9999386	10002228	So, remember Hex 168 came out, that 360 site?
10002248	10003329	Well, hexadecimal of 168 is 360.
10009730	10029018	This right here in binary is 360, and then there's this stupid thing that you go and type and stuff, and basically you can type in this, and there's little binary things, and there's a countdown, which, by the way, ends on the 15th, I want to say, at, I believe, 7 p.m.
10029118	10032239	Pacific time, wherever the hell that's supposed to be.
10032339	10032719	But anyways,
10033351	10043159	Um, so there's this thing, if you type in play in that, it takes you to this other screen, where I think there's these, all these things, and basically everyone's like, oh my god, you know, it's, it's some, you know, puzzle, we have to figure it out.
10043179	10047062	No, actually, you just type this stuff in, and other people type stuff, and they respond back to you, and
10047622	10049264	All that stuff, and these can all move around.
10049284	10049764	What, the chat room?
10050425	10051326	It's sort of a chat room.
10051346	10052787	Are people actually moving those?
10052847	10054028	Yeah, people are moving these.
10054088	10056410	Like, right now, I'm going to move a bunch of these at random.
10056971	10060935	And piss people off, because people are trying to, like, you know, type stuff in here.
10061575	10064799	And so I am moving them around to piss them off.
10068908	10072591	I'm going to type poop and we're going to see if that appears.
10072731	10074693	No, actually, see there's Firefly.
10075333	10076534	Someone just typed that earlier.
10076934	10078115	I was doing this the other day.
10078235	10087362	I kept typing Orange Lounge Radio over and over and over again just for the fuck of it because it'll actually appear at one point because you've typed it in so many times.
10088103	10088483	But, um...
10089625	10091647	So we'll just see if we can get this up here.
10091967	10092567	Alright, have fun with it.
10092587	10093448	What's the website for that again?
10093868	10101555	The website for this is www.101101000.com slash zero.
10103276	10104437	Yeah, good luck remembering that.
10104457	10106419	Can you post that in chat, please?
10106479	10111303	Meanwhile, we're going to go back to the Skype line because I promised some folks we'd go to the Skype line a little later in the show.
10111803	10113604	And wouldn't you know it, we already have a call.
10113925	10115046	Hello, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
10116229	10116950	Hey, what's up?
10117010	10117650	It's Ranma.
10118031	10119572	Hey, Ronchan, how are you?
10119652	10120052	Hello!
10120853	10122594	Hey, hi everybody, I'm Jamie.
10123495	10124015	What's on your mind?
10125316	10127678	Not much, I just want to touch upon a couple of things.
10128519	10137206	Xbox 360, if you're going to get one, I would suggest if you're on the Best Buy, I would get there about, oh, say, 5, 6 p.m.
10139187	10140048	That's crazy talk.
10141619	10143120	I was there for the PSP.
10143861	10144982	I got there at 7 a.m.
10145002	10145903	to take pictures.
10146143	10148125	There were people there at 6 a.m.
10149666	10152669	Now, you also live in New York City, though, so... Yeah.
10153610	10153930	All right.
10154250	10155592	No, no, no, no.
10155692	10157613	This is where I was living in the suburbs.
10157794	10158714	I was in the city there.
10158734	10160836	This was the suburbs where my desk might open up at 10.
10161357	10163859	There were people there at 7.
10164039	10166662	We opened so early just to sell the PSP's.
10167856	10174579	Okay, we're having kind of a hard time understanding you, Ran Chan, so you're kind of coming through really blurry.
10174899	10176900	Also, Rob has suddenly developed an accent.
10177480	10177720	I did?
10180562	10180962	Okay.
10181462	10182162	What did I say?
10183203	10183983	Understand.
10184643	10185044	Whatever.
10186084	10186484	Whatever.
10187245	10192147	Okay, so Ran Chan, you want to tell us really quick about some Nintendo event you went to?
10193107	10197189	Yeah, I went to the Nintendo World DDR Mario Mix Contest.
10198928	10199649	And what happened?
10199949	10203011	People got screwed.
10203332	10205914	They had everything developed in different colors.
10206434	10208536	And the topic that we covered was that.
10210237	10214220	But what happened was, they only did it for two rounds.
10214460	10217523	After that, every time, the top six get to advance.
10217843	10221606	Basically about 30, 20 people got screwed out of tournament.
10222549	10226351	Aw, it's a bummer, but I guess that's going to happen in probably one of the bigger cities or something.
10226791	10232153	Anyway, Ranchen, since you're kind of breaking up, I am going to have to let you go, but we hope we can talk to you again soon, a little later, okay?
10233053	10233493	Take care.
10234234	10234594	Later!
10235717	10240661	Okay, well, I think what he said there was about the DDR with Mario event at the official Nintendo Store.
10240682	10245866	It sounds like people got screwed out of it somehow after only a couple rounds.
10246066	10246627	That's too bad.
10246767	10252812	Loki, you were saying you got Orange Lounge to appear on the site, and it looks like everybody's moving things to the corners now.
10253733	10257136	Yeah, see, there's Orange Lounge right here.
10257176	10259318	I'm holding it, and I'm shaking it around.
10261160	10261841	That's great.
10264957	10274071	so our listeners are all on there just shuffling shit into all the corners beautiful God I love our listeners I so so love them
10275993	10277214	Another call on Skype line.
10277234	10278375	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
10278995	10280777	Obviously, I don't need any introduction.
10281657	10283539	Not at this point, Mr. Zaku.
10283819	10284540	What's on your mind?
10285881	10288623	Just a comment on the little DDR Mario mix thing.
10288643	10293727	The reason why people were getting screwed over is because, you know, it's Nintendo World's fault.
10293827	10301173	You know, I squarely put the blame on Nintendo World for the fact that they didn't go to DDR Freak or any of those sites to advertise the tournament.
10301813	10302353	So they suck.
10323154	10329316	Yeah, but you know, the whole DDR Mario Mix pretty much, you know, that whole tournament thing, you know, is a joke.
10329576	10331837	Okay, well DDR Mario Mix is a joke anyway, too.
10332177	10337059	So what I'm curious about, Saku, what's the latest on MTV?
10337079	10338500	Because you're going to be rich and famous, right?
10339092	10340493	Yeah, I got the email.
10340673	10343175	They sent me an email last Thursday.
10343215	10344375	I've already replied to them.
10344836	10348137	They're going to be filming next Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday.
10348418	10352960	Hopefully, I should be able to make it next Wednesday if I get more information from them.
10353741	10357403	And then a week after that, during MTV's Gaming Week, a.k.a.
10357483	10360344	the Xbox 360 Launch Week, they will air it.
10361585	10372070	If you can somehow get Orange Lounge in there, whether it be like a picture in the background, or you know, your name dropping it, or somehow Orange Lounge gets in there, I will... Dude, if you send me an OLR shirt, I will marry.
10372951	10373431	Seriously.
10373551	10381435	If you would make me an extra large shirt that says, in black, that says Orange Lounge Radio on it, I would definitely wear that shirt out.
10381555	10381935	Damn it.
10382596	10384437	Maybe, I don't know if we can get it done in time.
10385257	10387018	But, I'll send you a dollar.
10391003	10397825	Also, 1UP.com is saying that Beatmania is being pushed up early to the 15th of February of next year.
10400286	10404608	I do not know of any changes inside Konami as far as I know.
10404648	10407449	Well, I know what 1UP.com is saying, but I don't agree with it.
10408009	10408409	We'll see.
10408589	10408949	We'll see.
10409989	10410349	Maybe.
10410409	10414911	I could see it getting bumped up, but as far as I know, it's not done yet, so we'll see.
10416553	10416833	All right.
10417474	10418995	Well, Zachary, we're going to let you go.
10419135	10420016	Just do whatever.
10420236	10422638	Just see if you could try to send me a shirt or something.
10423259	10428604	I seriously would allow you to use me as a billboard or some sort of advertising.
10428684	10431947	We want to do the shirt thing so bad, but it's just a cost issue.
10432407	10433148	Or something like that.
10434849	10435190	All right.
10435750	10437071	All right, Zachary, we're going to let you go, okay?
10437151	10437632	Have a good one.
10437792	10439774	You know, just think about it, man.
10440194	10440574	I know.
10440634	10441415	We'll get it.
10441555	10441795	All right.
10441835	10442256	Take care.
10443036	10443277	Later.
10444056	10445276	All right, just so you know.
10445296	10446337	What's going on now on the site?
10446357	10447917	We've got like tons of people on the desk.
10447957	10448637	It's really funny.
10449757	10462501	The name of the page, the title, it is 101101000 and then colon, it's so much fun.
10464581	10464921	What?
10465882	10467862	Somebody actually put it so much fun on there?
10467882	10470723	No, I think it just, I don't know how it appeared on there, but...
10473786	10475106	It just says it's so much fun.
10475886	10477007	That's great.
10477167	10478167	So I gotta watch this.
10478187	10479067	What is going on here?
10479087	10482148	So everybody's on the site just like shuffling around.
10482168	10482908	Zombie butts.
10483628	10484468	I love Ross.
10486148	10487008	Goat say love.
10488309	10489689	Orange love Japan.
10491049	10494070	No you don't, you fucker.
10494090	10494450	That was great.
10494830	10495910	Jamie's fighting with somebody.
10495930	10497930	Whoever keeps touching orange rounds, stop.
10498971	10500351	I'm trying to get me on there, but...
10501267	10504009	DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
10529075	10532076	I have some thoughts about the Xbox 360 and everything.
10532296	10534536	Please, tell us your thoughts on the Xbox 360.
10536097	10540018	I saw it at Best Buy, and it looked like crap.
10541338	10541778	And what?
10542598	10543559	It looked like crap.
10543739	10544679	What was wrong with it?
10545699	10546939	It was really laggy.
10546999	10552921	They were playing King Kong, and everything was running at 15 FPS at that.
10553661	10555962	It looked like me playing Final Fantasy XI in lower Juno.
10556862	10557562	Yeah, basically.
10558237	10559198	It was really bad.
10559218	10562880	I was like, damn, this is what everybody's worked it up about.
10563421	10565882	So needless to say, you're not going to be buying an Xbox 360?
10567063	10568464	Not at the moment, no.
10568905	10569145	Nuh-uh.
10569325	10572207	I'm going to stick with my ghetto, broken-down Xbox for now.
10572287	10573928	I know what he's going to do instead.
10574368	10574649	What?
10575069	10575269	What?
10577130	10578711	What did you just buy last week?
10579132	10580773	Hint, nudge, elbow.
10582737	10583778	Uh, Star Hero?
10584278	10584939	No!
10585259	10586519	You bought one month of what?
10588080	10588361	Oh!
10588701	10589201	Light goes on.
10589501	10591142	Here, World of Warcraft.
10592143	10593864	I know, I got sucked in for another month.
10593964	10595745	Congratulations on that, by the way.
10596506	10596846	I know.
10597666	10599548	Man, I wasn't even home for five minutes last week.
10599828	10600628	What server are you on?
10602269	10604811	Uh... Yeah, I'm not telling it on air, but yeah.
10611069	10615191	I think it's great.
10616091	10620372	I think it's leaps and bounds better than Guitar Freaks ever was.
10621793	10627335	Just because of the fact that it's not all Richard J-pop, and I think that appeals a lot more to people.
10630096	10631556	Besides that, yeah, it's a great game.
10632076	10636218	Yeah, it's definitely different than Guitar Freaks, certainly a different song list, and it's going to appeal to a whole different audience.
10636792	10640114	All right, well, Jazz, we've got to go because we've got to wrap up the show, but thanks so much for calling in, okay?
10640134	10641515	All right, bye.
10641755	10642256	All right, later.
10642276	10643656	Bye.
10643676	10645598	All right, that's going to do it for our Skype calls tonight.
10646378	10653823	Okay, now's the part of the show where we're going to go around and get everybody's final thoughts because it's that time of the show where we're almost done.
10654263	10656244	So we're going to start it off by going over to Angel.
10657005	10658906	Angel, what is your final thought of the evening?
10663829	10665731	Must buy Guitar Hero.
10668445	10670947	Anyway, Loki.
10672248	10675931	I lost where my name went on this page.
10676472	10677072	Oh, there we are.
10677272	10680395	Whoa, I have like three names on there now.
10680895	10682336	It says Loki as goats say.
10684018	10684378	Awesome.
10685539	10689422	My final thought is ciabatta bread is yummy.
10689642	10690663	It's my favorite thing ever.
10691724	10693185	And DarkSakura, your final thought.
10694186	10695327	Rejectable cyclones.
10695607	10696688	Somebody send me to London.
10699011	10701352	All right, that's going to do it for tonight's show.
10701392	10702232	Tune in next week.
10702732	10704233	Tune into the podcast as well.
10704893	10710295	Next week, the one and only DarkSakura will not be here, sadly, because she'll be glamming it up at the podcast awards.
10711395	10713396	I'll represent if Jamie lets me grin.
10716377	10725600	If I get my way, we'll have a whole orgy of people here, because DarkSakura's chair is not an easy one to fill, so we'll have to get like five people to all sit in it at the same time, naked.
10726573	10726873	Zombie Butts
