[SPEAKER_03]: Orange Lounge Radio To Go Edition, week of November 28th, 2005.

00:02.551 --> 00:13.418
[SPEAKER_01]: You're tuned in to the Orange Lounge Radio To Go Edition, your podcast home for all the latest video game news and gamer chat.

00:13.658 --> 00:17.081
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, here are your hosts, DarkSakura, Sky, and Loki.

00:19.269 --> 00:20.729
[SPEAKER_01]: Hello, everybody.

00:20.869 --> 00:24.710
[SPEAKER_03]: Welcome to another edition of Orange Lounge Radio To Go.

00:25.450 --> 00:29.771
[SPEAKER_03]: It's that podcast dedicated to all things gaming, all the news you want to hear about.

00:30.271 --> 00:33.332
[SPEAKER_03]: And of course, as we always say, we like to talk about video games that don't suck.

00:33.752 --> 00:38.212
[SPEAKER_03]: Although sometimes we have to talk about video games that do suck just to warn you to stay the hell away.

00:38.933 --> 00:39.773
[SPEAKER_03]: My name is Rob Roberts.

00:39.793 --> 00:40.793
[SPEAKER_03]: You might know me as Sky.

00:40.913 --> 00:43.694
[SPEAKER_03]: Joining us, welcome back, DarkSakura.

00:43.774 --> 00:44.454
[SPEAKER_03]: We missed you.

00:44.754 --> 00:45.054
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi.

00:45.294 --> 00:45.774
[SPEAKER_03]: How are you doing?

00:46.494 --> 00:47.074
[SPEAKER_03]: Voiceless.

00:47.614 --> 00:48.074
[SPEAKER_03]: I know.

00:48.674 --> 00:51.775
[SPEAKER_03]: Now what, you have the, what we've been calling the wheel.

00:51.795 --> 00:52.275
[SPEAKER_03]: The plague.

00:52.955 --> 00:56.136
[SPEAKER_03]: Not the plague, the wheel of infection or whatever.

00:56.296 --> 00:58.957
[SPEAKER_03]: Because your doctor's telling you every week it's something different or something, right?

00:59.017 --> 01:02.877
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a cold that turned into a sinus infection while I was in L.A.

01:03.237 --> 01:04.718
[SPEAKER_00]: because I came back really sick.

01:04.838 --> 01:05.058
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.

01:05.498 --> 01:13.100
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he told me it was bronchitis but a chance that it was pneumonia and he put on my thing pneumonia and I had an x-ray and all that.

01:13.540 --> 01:15.180
[SPEAKER_00]: And this week he's telling me it's whooping cough.

01:15.800 --> 01:38.056
[SPEAKER_03]: or it might be he's taking the cultures he stuck a q-tip up my nose ew it was gross it tickled i wanted to sneeze well well you're back and i know you're not feeling it 100 but we appreciate you being here and our listeners have said they've missed you so as i'm sure you've seen in the mailbag so is their aim improving they're trying some people out there haven't missed you but they don't know they don't know crap yeah but they suck screw them

01:38.928 --> 01:40.069
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki's here, as always.

01:40.089 --> 01:40.749
[SPEAKER_03]: Say hello to Loki.

01:41.070 --> 01:41.390
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm here.

01:41.570 --> 01:42.591
[SPEAKER_03]: No whooping cough for Loki.

01:42.851 --> 01:43.111
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

01:43.532 --> 01:44.092
[SPEAKER_03]: No whooping cough.

01:44.412 --> 01:45.733
[SPEAKER_00]: I can arrange for you to get the plague.

01:46.574 --> 01:47.214
[SPEAKER_02]: How you doing, Loki?

01:47.935 --> 01:48.856
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm doing good.

01:49.516 --> 01:49.756
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes?

01:50.137 --> 01:50.417
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

01:51.057 --> 01:56.221
[SPEAKER_02]: I could be doing better, had I had a 360, but I'm still doing good.

01:56.441 --> 01:57.642
[SPEAKER_03]: Crazy stuff with the 360 launch, huh?

01:59.878 --> 02:00.819
[SPEAKER_03]: Nothing I didn't expect.

02:14.850 --> 02:16.552
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, have you been able to fit in any time for gaming?

02:16.572 --> 02:19.335
[SPEAKER_03]: I know you've been sick, but what have you been playing, if anything?

02:19.355 --> 02:20.876
[SPEAKER_03]: I played some Katamari last night

02:36.045 --> 02:36.945
[SPEAKER_03]: New one or the old one?

02:36.985 --> 02:41.447
[SPEAKER_00]: The new one, but I got motion sick because my stomach was already feeling irritated.

02:43.367 --> 02:56.631
[SPEAKER_00]: I turned on World of Warcraft and then shut it back down again because I couldn't stand... It's just like, because I've been so disoriented, it's been driving me crazy to play anything, so I've been taking it kind of easy with gaming.

02:57.152 --> 03:01.333
[SPEAKER_00]: However, I did play some PSO Blue Burst while I was in L.A.,

03:02.734 --> 03:05.956
[SPEAKER_00]: and did watch somebody play through a couple of quests on the Xbox.

03:07.538 --> 03:09.879
[SPEAKER_03]: And didn't you get a chance to check out Xbox 360?

03:10.720 --> 03:11.380
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, actually.

03:11.981 --> 03:29.113
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't play it because I just wasn't feeling well enough but I got to see Perfect Dark Zero which I thought was pretty cool and then Call of Duty and then Project Gotham Racing and Dan's been playing a whole lot of Need for Speed Underground so I've actually seen quite a bit of that.

03:30.117 --> 03:38.039
[SPEAKER_00]: and he compared it between Xbox and Xbox 360 and said that the 360 version really just seems like a port.

03:38.359 --> 03:41.039
[SPEAKER_00]: It's slower, not as much fun as the Xbox version.

03:41.900 --> 03:42.600
[SPEAKER_03]: Interesting.

03:43.920 --> 03:47.841
[SPEAKER_00]: And I got to see the BSOD on the Xbox 360.

03:47.961 --> 03:50.381
[SPEAKER_03]: Not the blue screen of death, but... The black screen of death!

03:50.502 --> 03:50.762
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.

03:53.530 --> 03:55.091
[SPEAKER_02]: What caused the black screen?

03:55.111 --> 03:55.831
[SPEAKER_02]: That's my ask.

03:55.851 --> 04:00.754
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it just got hot, but it was on the same game that I'm hearing most of the complaints about.

04:00.774 --> 04:05.657
[SPEAKER_00]: It was on... Call of Duty 2?

04:05.817 --> 04:05.997
[SPEAKER_00]: No.

04:06.797 --> 04:08.098
[SPEAKER_00]: On Project Gotham 3.

04:08.138 --> 04:10.679
[SPEAKER_03]: I was going to say, it's one of the racing games, if I remember right.

04:10.839 --> 04:17.863
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, in fact, one of our listeners had actually sent us an article about that, but I was going to say from experience, I've seen it happen.

04:18.303 --> 04:21.465
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was on that game, and most of the people I talked to said that it is on...

04:23.379 --> 04:28.025
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to say GTA, but it's Project Gotham.

04:28.105 --> 04:30.788
[SPEAKER_03]: And aren't they saying that it's all related to the power supply, basically?

04:32.190 --> 04:33.672
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that it's overheating.

04:33.712 --> 04:38.337
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know exactly why, but most of the people who run into the problems are playing with their game in a cabinet.

04:38.958 --> 04:40.160
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that's a common factor.

04:40.180 --> 04:42.022
[SPEAKER_03]: Hmm.

04:44.966 --> 04:46.367
[SPEAKER_03]: Anything else you wanted to share with us, DarkSakura?

04:47.548 --> 04:48.548
[SPEAKER_00]: Not particularly.

04:49.409 --> 04:52.551
[SPEAKER_00]: Unless you want to hear the details of my illness, I doubt that.

04:52.571 --> 04:53.432
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe on another show.

04:53.672 --> 04:54.072
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki.

04:55.833 --> 05:02.478
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I took a little time off this week because of my car and being broken.

05:03.559 --> 05:09.343
[SPEAKER_02]: Meanwhile, while that was being worked out, I've been playing Mario Kart DS, and that's really fun.

05:10.203 --> 05:11.444
[SPEAKER_02]: I do not like snaking.

05:11.892 --> 05:13.153
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

05:35.726 --> 05:36.287
[SPEAKER_02]: That I have to say.

05:36.327 --> 05:38.208
[SPEAKER_02]: But other than that, I'm playing people that don't snake.

05:38.308 --> 05:40.130
[SPEAKER_02]: It's still really fun, because the games get really close.

05:40.150 --> 05:45.875
[SPEAKER_02]: We played a match earlier today, and man, down one race, man, down the line, it was just crazy.

05:45.895 --> 05:48.477
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, me, you, and Miklatov were all playing a match in the house, right?

05:48.638 --> 05:49.598
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, and that was fun.

05:49.678 --> 05:50.039
[SPEAKER_03]: Good times.

05:50.459 --> 05:58.626
[SPEAKER_02]: So I really wish there'd be more people on my friends list popping on during the day, but a lot of times, even doing worldwide, it's hard to get four players, which is really strange.

05:58.867 --> 06:01.569
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know why I'm right in that problem, but I don't know.

06:02.230 --> 06:02.310
[SPEAKER_02]: Um...

06:03.420 --> 06:05.221
[SPEAKER_02]: Grand Theft Auto Multiplayer Shadow of Colossus

06:31.437 --> 06:35.779
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think it's as big, huge, impressive game that everyone was saying.

06:36.099 --> 06:38.921
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks pretty, yeah, but that's about it.

06:38.941 --> 06:40.382
[SPEAKER_02]: There's really no content to the game.

06:55.490 --> 06:57.874
[SPEAKER_03]: It just looked a little boring.

06:57.894 --> 06:59.758
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not sure I like the concept itself.

06:59.818 --> 07:01.160
[SPEAKER_03]: It looked a little... It is boring.

07:01.180 --> 07:02.402
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no story to it, really.

07:02.422 --> 07:06.490
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe it's just my perspective and what I look for in a game, but it didn't look like my kind of thing.

07:07.997 --> 07:11.378
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't like the fact that there's no other enemies, no nothing.

07:11.838 --> 07:12.959
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no real puzzle.

07:13.039 --> 07:18.400
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, the only puzzle solving in the game is figuring out how to get on these Colossus and figuring out how to kill them.

07:18.641 --> 07:20.161
[SPEAKER_02]: But once you're done with that, you're done.

07:20.221 --> 07:22.022
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's only 16 of them in the game.

07:22.322 --> 07:29.004
[SPEAKER_02]: Granted, there is a hard mode, but when you go through the hard mode and the time modes or whatever, you can actually unlock more weapons to make it easier.

07:29.927 --> 07:31.528
[SPEAKER_02]: Why do you want the game to be easier?

07:31.628 --> 07:32.368
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to be shorter.

07:32.408 --> 07:38.832
[SPEAKER_02]: Doesn't it have some point where you can actually kill lizards and shoot fruit with a bow and arrow and stuff?

07:40.362 --> 07:41.243
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

08:10.951 --> 08:12.593
[SPEAKER_02]: I just want to get done with it so I can sell it back

08:29.235 --> 08:33.877
[SPEAKER_03]: Some games that I've been playing this week, I checked out the Final Fantasy XII demo and I gotta say I'm pretty impressed.

08:34.718 --> 08:45.183
[SPEAKER_03]: They did change some stuff from what I saw at E3 two years ago in regards to the battle system because it looks like now with the battle system that there's not the boxes around the screen or anything.

08:45.223 --> 08:58.589
[SPEAKER_03]: It is very seamless where you are walking around and it's unlike other Final Fantasy games in the past, except for XI of course, where you, but I know a lot of people didn't play that, where you walk up to something and engage it like in real time and it's very different from Final Fantasy's of the past.

08:58.889 --> 09:13.978
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think what's very interesting about the battle system, which is pretty much all that this demo really allows you to see is the battle system, is that you basically, it kind of fuses XI with the old battle systems, which I think is very interesting because there's a lot about XI I really did like.

09:14.558 --> 09:20.822
[SPEAKER_03]: And the thing is that your party members, if you want them to, will do their own things.

09:21.002 --> 09:23.884
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's almost like you're playing online but with intelligent people.

09:28.086 --> 09:36.792
[SPEAKER_03]: I was a little disappointed with the summon sequences, even though they're grand and overdone like they are in every Final Fantasy game.

09:36.812 --> 09:39.373
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know, I was expecting something a little bit different.

09:39.413 --> 09:41.174
[SPEAKER_03]: A little bit of load time problems there, but nothing...

09:42.515 --> 09:44.696
[SPEAKER_03]: I can see the pixelation really bad on my TV.

09:44.716 --> 09:44.976
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry.

10:06.464 --> 10:08.185
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm having microphone problems tonight, sorry guys.

10:09.665 --> 10:15.347
[SPEAKER_03]: It would look very pixelated on my TV, and if that's the way that the game actually looks when it comes out, I'm going to be sorely disappointed.

10:16.407 --> 10:18.068
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sure this is just because it's a demo.

10:18.168 --> 10:33.032
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm very sure it's just the demo, and the movies will look fantastic, but I couldn't help but kind of sense a little bit of disappointment because I wanted to see in the demo a little bit that, you know, nice looking game, you know, the rendering sequences and everything, so...

10:34.152 --> 10:38.956
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, obviously, if I got the Final Fantasy XII demo, I must be playing Dragon Quest VIII, which is true.

10:38.997 --> 10:40.378
[SPEAKER_03]: I picked up a copy of Dragon Quest VIII.

10:40.678 --> 10:43.761
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a lot of stuff I really like about Dragon Quest VIII.

10:44.341 --> 10:51.267
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm gonna be honest with you guys, I haven't really been into a Dragon Warrior or Dragon Quest game since the very, very first game on the NES.

10:51.647 --> 10:52.027
[SPEAKER_03]: I've kind of...

10:52.768 --> 10:54.349
[SPEAKER_03]: Just slept through the rest of the series.

10:54.389 --> 10:56.090
[SPEAKER_03]: I never played the one that was out on PlayStation.

10:56.390 --> 10:58.852
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't bother to play... Well, of course, a lot of them didn't even come out here.

10:59.152 --> 11:00.953
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't bother to play any of the other ones on the NES.

11:01.213 --> 11:02.794
[SPEAKER_03]: So I kind of napped through a lot of Dragon Quest.

11:02.834 --> 11:05.416
[SPEAKER_03]: But I'm, for some reason, finding myself really liking this one.

11:05.996 --> 11:17.123
[SPEAKER_03]: It's definitely an old-style RPG, which is good and, you know, maybe not good for some people, but good for me because it's definitely a throwback to, like, the older games where it's like, you know, the enemies are there, attack, magic.

11:17.143 --> 11:17.864
[SPEAKER_03]: It's very basic.

11:17.884 --> 11:19.385
[SPEAKER_03]: They don't try to overdo it with all these...

11:20.529 --> 11:24.894
[SPEAKER_03]: They don't try to overdo it with all these crazy concepts or anything during the battles.

11:24.934 --> 11:25.795
[SPEAKER_03]: So I like it.

11:25.855 --> 11:26.456
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a good game.

11:27.077 --> 11:29.199
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of good graphics, too.

11:29.239 --> 11:36.188
[SPEAKER_03]: It's got a very different graphical style to it, obviously, because some of the graphics were done by a famous anime guy and

11:37.590 --> 11:41.155
[SPEAKER_03]: The only disappointment I would say that I have with the game is the cut sequences.

11:41.495 --> 11:47.223
[SPEAKER_03]: There's some cut sequences in there that have a lot of load time, and the voice acting is very slow.

11:47.563 --> 11:52.330
[SPEAKER_03]: And I find myself wanting to push the X button before the cut sequence finishes, usually.

11:53.371 --> 11:57.653
[SPEAKER_03]: Just to get through the cut sequences there, I usually want to push the X button just to get through them.

11:58.794 --> 12:00.775
[SPEAKER_03]: I apologize again, you guys, but I have a crazy mic tonight.

12:00.815 --> 12:02.595
[SPEAKER_03]: I might have to pass back and forth with somebody else here.

12:02.615 --> 12:07.918
[SPEAKER_00]: For the record, it's Toriyama, who did Dragon Ball Z. Thank you, I couldn't remember that name.

12:07.938 --> 12:10.659
[SPEAKER_03]: I knew he did Dragon Ball Z. Dr. Slump and Classic.

12:10.679 --> 12:12.540
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the only thing that turns me off about that game.

12:12.580 --> 12:14.301
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't like Dragon Ball Z at all.

12:14.881 --> 12:18.983
[SPEAKER_03]: But, you know, a lot of the character animations are very funny, like a lot of the animals.

12:19.023 --> 12:25.305
[SPEAKER_03]: The monsters are very similar to what you saw in the old Dragon Warrior games, you know, the slimes and everything.

12:25.586 --> 12:29.747
[SPEAKER_03]: But they do some funny things, like they'll make your characters dance, and the dancing motions are hilarious.

12:29.827 --> 12:30.228
[SPEAKER_03]: I love it.

12:30.328 --> 12:30.728
[SPEAKER_03]: It's great.

12:30.808 --> 12:33.029
[SPEAKER_03]: So, yeah, I definitely...

12:33.749 --> 12:42.311
[SPEAKER_03]: I recommend Dragon Quest VIII if you're a fan of roleplaying games, especially if you're looking for a throwback to a very old, less complicated RPG type game.

12:42.751 --> 12:43.692
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of work, though.

12:43.932 --> 12:47.132
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not something you can just play through very quickly and watch the cutscenes.

12:47.432 --> 12:50.313
[SPEAKER_03]: You will die if you don't take some time to stop and gain experience.

12:50.333 --> 12:51.914
[SPEAKER_03]: And that bugs some people, so I don't know.

12:52.154 --> 13:01.356
[SPEAKER_02]: Granted, though, if you are still looking for a throwback to really old games and stuff, especially old RPGs, Wild Arms Alter Code F, which came out a couple weeks ago,

13:01.812 --> 13:11.474
[SPEAKER_02]: and Romancing Saga, which came out a couple months ago, which was the original Saga Frontier, so both remakes of their original counterparts should be pretty good, too.

13:12.635 --> 13:15.715
[SPEAKER_02]: And, oh, and, and, and, in a couple weeks, Final Fantasy IV.

13:17.396 --> 13:19.016
[SPEAKER_03]: What's the street date on that, do we know?

13:19.696 --> 13:26.258
[SPEAKER_02]: Second week in, or no, wait, yeah, second week, second real week in December, so around the week of the 12th, I think.

13:27.738 --> 13:28.999
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm definitely looking forward to that.

13:29.219 --> 13:30.139
[SPEAKER_00]: You spoony bard.

13:32.866 --> 13:34.747
[SPEAKER_03]: I think we'll start off getting into the news tonight.

13:34.807 --> 13:44.111
[SPEAKER_03]: However, I want to issue a couple of corrections to things we've talked about on previous podcasts because, you know, we're human, we're gaming fans, and we sometimes make mistakes.

13:44.752 --> 13:47.853
[SPEAKER_03]: This first one isn't so much a mistake as it is a clarification.

13:47.873 --> 13:52.715
[SPEAKER_03]: A couple podcasts ago we were talking about Guild Wars, and I said that NCSoft makes Guild Wars.

13:53.115 --> 14:00.640
[SPEAKER_03]: And somebody over on our forums, a main fan over on the forums, wanted to clarify that ArenaNet actually made Guild Wars, and they deserve the credit.

14:01.060 --> 14:03.102
[SPEAKER_03]: NCSoft simply publishes the game.

14:03.982 --> 14:12.468
[SPEAKER_03]: Which is interesting because it kind of brings up this whole thing about, you know, usually it is the publishers that get the credit because they're the ones that are, you know, paying for the advertising and all that stuff that are, you know...

14:13.068 --> 14:13.608
[SPEAKER_03]: and so on.

14:35.500 --> 14:37.381
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm definitely willing to issue that clarification there.

14:38.322 --> 14:44.706
[SPEAKER_03]: But just be careful with what you read out there because sometimes the people who are publishing the game may not necessarily be making it.

14:44.726 --> 14:48.828
[SPEAKER_03]: A classic example would be Nintendo publishes a lot of stuff that they don't necessarily do.

14:49.148 --> 14:50.209
[SPEAKER_03]: Like the old Rare games.

14:51.049 --> 14:51.449
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

14:52.630 --> 14:52.870
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway.

14:54.031 --> 14:54.571
[SPEAKER_03]: Something to think about.

14:54.591 --> 15:03.195
[SPEAKER_03]: The other clarification we would like to make was related to something that we talked about previously last week and it had to do with the Chinese gamer and the parents were suing Blizzard.

15:03.676 --> 15:09.879
[SPEAKER_03]: He was not a World of Warcraft player because World of Warcraft wasn't really out in China until May of this year.

15:10.279 --> 15:19.524
[SPEAKER_03]: It was actually Warcraft 3 was the game that the Chinese gamer committed suicide after playing and the parents are still suing Blizzard because of it.

15:20.025 --> 15:28.945
[SPEAKER_03]: But of course, this just goes to show, because we get our news from other sources, obviously, because there's very few companies that send us releases directly.

15:30.270 --> 15:30.830
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

15:51.025 --> 15:52.086
[SPEAKER_00]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

16:12.415 --> 16:13.955
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just stupidity.

16:14.435 --> 16:16.036
[SPEAKER_00]: Taking the bad genes out of the gene pool.

16:16.376 --> 16:18.936
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, let's start off with our first story tonight.

16:18.996 --> 16:23.157
[SPEAKER_03]: And I said for tonight's first story I wanted to do anything besides an Xbox 360 story.

16:23.217 --> 16:25.578
[SPEAKER_03]: Just because I'm too oversaturated.

16:25.758 --> 16:28.058
[SPEAKER_03]: And believe me, we have plenty of Xbox 360 things to talk about.

16:28.078 --> 16:30.499
[SPEAKER_03]: But I said anything but an Xbox 360 story.

16:31.479 --> 16:33.359
[SPEAKER_03]: So we have something better.

16:33.719 --> 16:35.000
[SPEAKER_03]: We have a story about 50 Cent.

16:36.140 --> 16:36.580
[SPEAKER_02]: He's retarded.

16:38.239 --> 16:41.700
[SPEAKER_03]: 50 Cent actually has this game, 50 Cent Bulletproof, which came out recently.

16:42.181 --> 16:46.583
[SPEAKER_03]: And sexual themes, intense violence, use of drugs, blood and gore.

16:46.943 --> 16:48.664
[SPEAKER_03]: No surprise this game has an M rating, right?

16:49.344 --> 16:54.667
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, guess what Curtis Jackson, also known as 50 Cent, said in a recent interview with Reuters.

16:55.388 --> 16:59.470
[SPEAKER_03]: Just because it is rated mature doesn't mean you shouldn't buy it for your kids.

17:00.711 --> 17:01.791
[SPEAKER_03]: No, actually, that's what it means.

17:01.932 --> 17:03.392
[SPEAKER_03]: Hold on, hold on, though, now, wait a minute.

17:03.412 --> 17:05.693
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I think this is where most people stopped reading.

17:06.093 --> 17:10.195
[SPEAKER_03]: And here's what the rest of what 50 Cent has to say.

17:10.835 --> 17:15.357
[SPEAKER_03]: He said, play the game and explain to them what they are playing.

17:16.658 --> 17:20.239
[SPEAKER_03]: So he's saying that parents should play the game and then explain to the kids what they are playing.

17:20.619 --> 17:20.780
[SPEAKER_03]: So...

17:21.980 --> 17:24.101
[SPEAKER_03]: I think the intentions might be good here.

17:24.582 --> 17:29.865
[SPEAKER_03]: I know I wouldn't let my kid play this type of game because that's just too much violence and sex and all that stuff.

17:30.626 --> 17:40.552
[SPEAKER_03]: But I do like the fact, I think many people pass this off as 50 Cent is crazy, but I do like the fact that he is saying, parents, play the game with your child.

17:40.672 --> 17:42.153
[SPEAKER_03]: Parents, get involved.

17:42.753 --> 17:50.658
[SPEAKER_03]: Even though maybe he didn't say it the right way, I at least kind of give him a little bit of credit for trying to say that the parents should be involved, although maybe he wasn't.

17:50.779 --> 17:51.139
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

17:51.599 --> 17:52.779
[SPEAKER_03]: But, what do you think?

17:53.139 --> 17:58.700
[SPEAKER_02]: I think what he's saying is, oh my god, my game was released one week after True Crime New York City.

17:59.100 --> 18:00.461
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not going to sell very well.

18:00.681 --> 18:02.461
[SPEAKER_02]: Kids, please buy my game because I need the money.

18:04.321 --> 18:06.262
[SPEAKER_00]: He's just not thinking.

18:06.582 --> 18:07.762
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all it is.

18:08.942 --> 18:12.123
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought he was like, you can use this as a teaching tool.

18:12.183 --> 18:15.723
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, maybe this is too loud.

18:15.763 --> 18:18.484
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe it could be a teaching tool of sorts.

18:19.344 --> 18:19.584
[SPEAKER_00]: But,

18:20.774 --> 18:26.497
[SPEAKER_00]: In the real world, kids are just gonna go, oh, 50 Cent said I should play this violent game, blah blah blah blah blah.

18:29.378 --> 18:29.838
[SPEAKER_00]: Whatever.

18:32.219 --> 18:37.021
[SPEAKER_03]: I wouldn't be surprised if they'd taken him completely out of context in this interview, because you know that stuff happens all the time.

18:37.081 --> 18:39.922
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki, you wouldn't know anything about being taken out of context in an interview.

18:40.223 --> 18:41.123
[SPEAKER_00]: Isn't it so much fun?

18:45.681 --> 18:45.981
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright.

18:48.284 --> 18:51.106
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess now we can talk a little bit about Xbox 360.

18:52.288 --> 18:53.229
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's talk about this.

18:53.909 --> 18:56.112
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if you knew this, but Microsoft is taking $126...

18:58.732 --> 19:01.753
[SPEAKER_03]: They're writing it off for every Xbox 360 system they sell.

19:02.214 --> 19:08.457
[SPEAKER_03]: And while this may sound shocking, it actually isn't that uncommon because the gaming companies really make their money back on the games.

19:08.917 --> 19:14.260
[SPEAKER_03]: So just so you know, if you wanted to know how much of a loss Microsoft's taking on these consoles, $126.

19:14.600 --> 19:16.781
[SPEAKER_03]: And that doesn't count when you throw in all these peripherals.

19:16.801 --> 19:18.142
[SPEAKER_03]: This is just the console itself.

19:18.602 --> 19:19.502
[SPEAKER_03]: So kind of interesting.

19:20.102 --> 19:24.845
[SPEAKER_03]: Microsoft also saying that they are aware of the shortages and they are pushing...

19:26.346 --> 19:31.408
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a quote from Peter Moore, the Corporate Vice President of Worldwide Marketing and Publishing.

19:31.428 --> 19:36.630
[SPEAKER_03]: He said, Our goal is to replenish inventory in the channel every week.

19:36.991 --> 19:40.052
[SPEAKER_03]: So lots of Xbox 360s are flowing in every single week.

19:40.352 --> 19:43.193
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not like we're shipping and then going dry for two or three weeks.

19:43.794 --> 19:45.094
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki, do you have anything to add to this mess?

19:45.414 --> 19:51.978
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, basically, he's quoted saying, and I just saw this earlier, because they basically...

19:53.592 --> 19:56.694
[SPEAKER_02]: They're not going to be short at all with what's coming out here.

19:56.954 --> 19:57.715
[SPEAKER_02]: I wish I had the article.

19:57.755 --> 19:59.476
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, here we go.

19:59.936 --> 20:08.201
[SPEAKER_02]: Basically, Major Nelson, the guy who's behind a lot of this launch stuff, he was visiting his family here on the East Coast.

20:08.282 --> 20:12.304
[SPEAKER_02]: He took the opportunity over the past couple of days to stop at various retailers.

20:18.757 --> 20:24.181
[SPEAKER_02]: I double checked with the retail team and while I can't speak to each retail outlet's specific distribution strategy, I can tell you that we...

20:43.789 --> 20:45.210
[SPEAKER_02]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

21:12.510 --> 21:16.093
[SPEAKER_03]: And you know these Xbox 360s have been reporting crashing in DarkSakura.

21:16.113 --> 21:17.734
[SPEAKER_03]: You saw one of these things crash.

21:17.994 --> 21:20.736
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, to be perfectly honest, we got the BSOD once.

21:21.277 --> 21:27.201
[SPEAKER_00]: And then after that, I actually just saw it freeze without anything.

21:27.562 --> 21:29.183
[SPEAKER_00]: Just completely froze in the middle of a race.

21:33.046 --> 21:36.648
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, apparently you can actually fix these crashing Xbox 360s.

21:36.688 --> 21:41.772
[SPEAKER_03]: This was something that was posted over on GameSpot forums, that you can actually fix it with string.

21:42.132 --> 21:51.478
[SPEAKER_03]: All you have to do, hang it from above the ground, because the problem is that in these cabinets and stuff, they're overheating, because there's no way for it to effectively cool down.

21:51.498 --> 21:54.360
[SPEAKER_02]: The power supply is overheating, and I might clear that up.

21:54.741 --> 21:59.104
[SPEAKER_02]: But the problem is, the power supply does have a fan, and like any console, you want to keep it...

22:00.322 --> 22:00.622
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura.com

22:30.373 --> 22:33.315
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually had a lot of the same issue.

22:33.555 --> 22:36.336
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember when the Dreamcast was released saying that it was overheating.

22:38.417 --> 22:47.502
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, what we used to do was we actually had a box set out until we started using our PS2 as a Dreamcast stand and letting it air out.

22:48.018 --> 22:52.400
[SPEAKER_00]: because all you have to do is keep those vents free of any obstruction and it does just fine.

22:52.600 --> 22:53.001
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what?

22:53.021 --> 22:56.883
[SPEAKER_02]: Some third-party company is going to come out just like they did with the original PlayStation.

22:56.903 --> 23:00.845
[SPEAKER_02]: Remember the fan that straps to the side of it and blows air through it so it doesn't overheat it.

23:02.025 --> 23:05.747
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe the same thing could set the power supply in something and it cools it off.

23:05.767 --> 23:07.988
[SPEAKER_03]: Or maybe you could not release a console that overheats.

23:08.429 --> 23:08.869
[SPEAKER_03]: How about that?

23:09.169 --> 23:09.889
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that might be good.

23:11.210 --> 23:12.951
[SPEAKER_00]: I tell you, they're falling into the Dreamcast trap.

23:13.737 --> 23:15.479
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, you have something about the N-Gage, right?

23:15.499 --> 23:16.419
[SPEAKER_03]: This made me smile.

23:24.071 --> 23:26.873
[SPEAKER_00]: Nokia shifts focus from gaming.

23:27.373 --> 23:28.714
[SPEAKER_00]: And how long did this take them?

23:30.596 --> 23:41.283
[SPEAKER_00]: Nokia's VP of Corporate Strategy, I guess I'm pronouncing this right, Antti Vasara, has confirmed that there are no plans for future versions of the N-Gage.

23:41.743 --> 23:47.907
[SPEAKER_00]: They are turning their focus toward mobile TV and music with the introduction of handsets like the N91.

23:49.228 --> 23:51.690
[SPEAKER_00]: A smartphone that can hold up to 3,000 music tracks.

23:52.991 --> 24:00.776
[SPEAKER_00]: They're planning on placing a greater emphasis on mobile gaming in 2007, which by that time, screen sizes and quality will offer better games.

24:01.456 --> 24:06.799
[SPEAKER_02]: And also the other thing is they're going to be introducing, they don't want just one platform dedicated to gaming.

24:06.820 --> 24:11.863
[SPEAKER_02]: They're actually going to be incorporating to all their M60 phones, which will be coming out.

24:11.943 --> 24:16.786
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's another reason why that they shouldn't be supporting the N-Gage.

24:17.025 --> 24:22.728
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the quote I have from him is, N-Gage is still being sold, but it was not success in the sense of developing a new category.

24:22.748 --> 24:26.310
[SPEAKER_03]: So, N-Gage, we bid thee farewell.

24:30.793 --> 24:31.133
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.

24:32.694 --> 24:33.834
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, darn, what a loss.

24:34.275 --> 24:40.738
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry, I think we've been doing this for like 45 weeks now, and I haven't yet to use the soundboard for anything, so I had to do that.

24:43.830 --> 24:45.032
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry, the N-Gage was crappy.

24:45.893 --> 24:47.594
[SPEAKER_03]: I tried to like this system so bad.

24:47.654 --> 24:48.876
[SPEAKER_03]: I tried to play it at E3.

24:50.037 --> 24:50.878
[SPEAKER_00]: You have an N-Gage?

24:50.918 --> 24:51.999
[SPEAKER_00]: We gave it away.

24:53.100 --> 24:53.420
[SPEAKER_03]: It's bad.

24:53.520 --> 24:55.603
[SPEAKER_00]: It was the first model taco phone.

24:56.964 --> 24:57.224
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

24:58.505 --> 25:06.614
[SPEAKER_03]: Speaking of something that should be sent far, far away, something about Jack Thompson, and I don't like bringing this guy up every week, but you got something funny.

25:07.392 --> 25:19.215
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, actually one of our regular listeners, Rob with two B's, he's actually sent me several articles and one of them I thought was about time.

25:19.795 --> 25:23.336
[SPEAKER_00]: Jack Thompson's Alabama license was revoked.

25:24.176 --> 25:29.917
[SPEAKER_00]: He had been basically shipped out before, you know, while they reviewed it, but his license is actually gone.

25:30.358 --> 25:32.178
[SPEAKER_00]: He cannot practice law in the state of Alabama.

25:33.049 --> 25:37.852
[SPEAKER_03]: Which just goes to show you, boys and girls, do not fuck with the gaming community.

25:38.573 --> 25:39.833
[SPEAKER_03]: Just kidding, don't sue me.

25:40.354 --> 25:40.794
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course.

25:43.135 --> 25:59.966
[SPEAKER_00]: He fired back at Judge Moore by claiming that the judge had violated the Alabama canons of judicial ethics by his unfortunate, improper, and prejudicial acts in this case at the expense of three bereaved Alabama families.

26:00.066 --> 26:02.048
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, let me guess, he's an activist judge.

26:02.068 --> 26:02.128
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

26:03.058 --> 26:03.659
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what?

26:04.059 --> 26:09.865
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's because there's somebody with some common sense in my home state, excuse me, who thought that you were a big loser.

26:10.045 --> 26:10.586
[SPEAKER_00]: How about that?

26:11.467 --> 26:14.150
[SPEAKER_02]: Too bad he practices law mainly out of Florida.

26:15.571 --> 26:15.852
[SPEAKER_02]: Who cares?

26:16.672 --> 26:18.134
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry to any of our listeners in Florida.

26:19.676 --> 26:20.977
[SPEAKER_03]: Moving on, Loki, what else?

26:21.017 --> 26:22.098
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry, you have to put up with him.

26:22.599 --> 26:23.600
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki, what else do you have for us?

26:23.991 --> 26:31.495
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, other than overheating Xboxes, we're hearing reports of scratching discs in the Xboxes as well.

26:32.156 --> 26:34.617
[SPEAKER_02]: Some people are saying, don't play your Xbox vertical.

26:34.717 --> 26:36.398
[SPEAKER_02]: Some are saying, don't play it horizontal.

26:37.058 --> 26:38.499
[SPEAKER_02]: Some people are just saying, don't play it at all.

26:38.559 --> 26:42.321
[SPEAKER_02]: But basically, no matter what you do, your disc will get scratched.

26:43.757 --> 26:47.439
[SPEAKER_02]: Basically, the moral of the story is don't tip your Xbox over while you're playing it.

26:47.960 --> 26:53.103
[SPEAKER_02]: It goes to show you that they're really rushes the market if they haven't found out, oh, you have these detrimental things.

26:53.143 --> 26:54.383
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, this is scratching disk.

26:54.683 --> 26:56.685
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe that's not a good feature they put in there.

26:58.546 --> 26:59.887
[SPEAKER_02]: So that was kind of interesting.

27:00.387 --> 27:06.370
[SPEAKER_02]: The other one that I thought was kind of funny is they were talking about the Xbox 360 DVD player.

27:06.791 --> 27:07.331
[SPEAKER_02]: They're saying it's...

27:07.859 --> 27:09.460
[SPEAKER_03]: Not very good, actually.

27:10.401 --> 27:13.042
[SPEAKER_03]: Funny, neither was the Xbox's DVD player.

27:13.122 --> 27:14.723
[SPEAKER_03]: No progressive scan, excuse me?

27:15.023 --> 27:17.185
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not nearly as awful as the PS2.

27:17.225 --> 27:27.271
[SPEAKER_02]: They were testing it on Episode 3 and said it looked decent, but this person who was reviewing it, their Samsung progressive player blew it out of the water.

27:28.132 --> 27:30.173
[SPEAKER_02]: So it sounds like no progressive on this one either.

27:31.253 --> 27:32.534
[SPEAKER_03]: You've got to be kidding me.

27:32.614 --> 27:35.236
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I swear I read an article that said they had it.

27:36.693 --> 27:38.774
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sure some listener is going to email us one way or the other.

27:40.235 --> 27:40.676
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what?

27:40.716 --> 27:44.398
[SPEAKER_00]: You shouldn't be using your video game system as a DVD player anyway.

27:45.519 --> 27:46.340
[SPEAKER_03]: Some of us are cheap.

27:46.760 --> 27:47.300
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what?

27:47.340 --> 27:54.966
[SPEAKER_00]: You can go to Sam's Club and pay $50 and get a DVD player that will do everything you need it to do.

27:55.606 --> 27:58.789
[SPEAKER_02]: And finally, with every video game system launch...

27:59.249 --> 28:02.811
[SPEAKER_02]: There's always going to be a campaign to put Linux on it.

28:02.851 --> 28:03.411
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right.

28:04.912 --> 28:15.158
[SPEAKER_02]: Free60, the Free60 project, is aiming to put Linux, such as Darwin, on the Xbox 360.

28:15.739 --> 28:20.161
[SPEAKER_02]: And they've gathered lots of useful, detailed information surrounding inner workings of the 360.

28:20.741 --> 28:25.024
[SPEAKER_02]: For example, apparently the Xbox 360 is secured down by the following.

28:25.064 --> 28:26.885
[SPEAKER_02]: A flash that's encrypted.

28:27.352 --> 28:27.913
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura,

28:43.115 --> 28:43.975
[SPEAKER_02]: Voila, homebrew.

28:46.796 --> 28:58.660
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, although I've kind of made fun of the people that install Linux on systems in the past, honestly, I do get the point of this when it comes to the Xbox 360 because it does open the door to all this neat homebrew stuff.

28:59.140 --> 29:03.341
[SPEAKER_03]: It's when you try to install Linux on like a toaster and a Billy Bass that I kind of go, what?

29:03.481 --> 29:04.201
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, it's been done.

29:04.461 --> 29:06.302
[SPEAKER_03]: Or a speak and spell, I know it's been done.

29:06.322 --> 29:07.562
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like, you know, come on.

29:09.363 --> 29:12.364
[SPEAKER_03]: What is the practical, I mean, what are you going to run on a Billy Bass?

29:13.931 --> 29:14.573
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, Harry Potter

29:22.591 --> 29:25.112
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, because I actually just saw the movie this week.

29:25.172 --> 29:25.752
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm so happy.

29:26.352 --> 29:29.012
[SPEAKER_03]: I decided to see Rent instead, actually.

29:29.373 --> 29:30.873
[SPEAKER_03]: And I do want to see Harry Potter.

29:30.893 --> 29:34.014
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm thinking of that song from Team America.

29:34.254 --> 29:37.454
[SPEAKER_03]: I want the kids to be gone.

29:37.514 --> 29:39.715
[SPEAKER_03]: And I couldn't help but think about that the whole time I was watching.

29:40.815 --> 29:42.415
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to get hate mail over this, but I hated Rent.

29:42.435 --> 29:43.116
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought it was awful.

29:43.656 --> 29:45.376
[SPEAKER_03]: The whole time I was sitting there going, get a job!

29:46.116 --> 29:46.656
[SPEAKER_03]: Get a job!

29:47.317 --> 29:48.297
[SPEAKER_00]: I still want to see it.

29:48.477 --> 29:49.237
[SPEAKER_03]: Or get AIDS.

29:49.981 --> 29:53.964
[SPEAKER_00]: But it was supposed to be a retelling of La Boheme.

29:56.345 --> 29:57.706
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, but then they, never mind.

29:58.266 --> 30:00.307
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, Harry Potter.

30:00.968 --> 30:01.768
[SPEAKER_00]: Harry Potter.

30:03.769 --> 30:11.374
[SPEAKER_00]: Electronic Arts released a one-level demo for the movie tie-in for Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, and it's available for download.

30:14.778 --> 30:16.220
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure if it's on EA's site.

30:16.320 --> 30:18.824
[SPEAKER_00]: I know they have a link to it from Eurogamer.

30:20.667 --> 30:25.676
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would suggest go there, click on the article about the Harry Potter demo and give it a download because it's supposed to be pretty cool.

30:27.387 --> 30:32.710
[SPEAKER_03]: I saw it for like half a minute at E3, and I was like, that looks kind of neat.

30:33.010 --> 30:41.075
[SPEAKER_03]: I did play like Harry Potter DS for like two seconds, and I just knew that you, I did the little spell thing with the stylus, and I thought that was kind of funny.

30:41.455 --> 30:42.376
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I don't know.

30:43.176 --> 30:46.798
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't buy a lot of the movie tie-ins unless it's really good.

30:47.038 --> 30:48.739
[SPEAKER_03]: Like Street Fighter 2, the movie, the game.

30:49.120 --> 30:49.540
[SPEAKER_03]: Just kidding.

30:49.760 --> 30:50.160
[SPEAKER_03]: That sucked.

30:50.420 --> 30:51.221
[SPEAKER_02]: I have that in my meme.

30:51.561 --> 30:56.344
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I think I have that somewhere in a box for Saturn.

30:57.273 --> 30:57.713
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry.

30:57.733 --> 30:58.234
[SPEAKER_00]: It's awful.

30:58.834 --> 31:00.476
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we bought it because it was a dollar.

31:02.498 --> 31:07.582
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's go over to ye olde mailbag, and I'm sure we've got plenty of emails.

31:08.142 --> 31:09.664
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura's got to catch us up tonight.

31:10.544 --> 31:14.588
[SPEAKER_03]: If you want to send us an email, 2go at orangeloungeradio.com is the place to send an email.

31:14.888 --> 31:18.111
[SPEAKER_03]: The lovely DarkSakura will read your email and make fun of your grammar.

31:19.112 --> 31:20.093
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I'd do that anyway.

31:20.113 --> 31:22.114
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd do that for free.

31:22.214 --> 31:22.695
[SPEAKER_03]: What do we got?

31:23.780 --> 31:28.383
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, just a couple more articles sent to us by our friend Rob, who is not you.

31:30.344 --> 31:32.366
[SPEAKER_00]: One about the PS3 pricing.

31:32.426 --> 31:34.247
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually read through this article.

31:34.447 --> 31:36.468
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a bit long to cover for the podcast.

31:37.109 --> 31:38.930
[SPEAKER_03]: I briefly read the article.

31:39.650 --> 31:42.712
[SPEAKER_00]: It was on CNN Money, actually.

31:42.752 --> 31:43.833
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think they retracted

31:44.663 --> 31:45.643
[SPEAKER_03]: I think I heard about that.

31:45.663 --> 31:47.124
[SPEAKER_03]: They retracted that a little later.

31:47.184 --> 31:50.685
[SPEAKER_03]: So, don't believe anything you hear and tell like E3.

31:50.785 --> 32:03.510
[SPEAKER_00]: This is fairly recent, but they were talking about with the DVD formats, the different high definition formats being supported by Sony and Microsoft, bringing back sort of like the old Betamax VHS war.

32:04.851 --> 32:05.331
[SPEAKER_00]: Goody, goody.

32:05.471 --> 32:06.911
[SPEAKER_00]: Betamax was better, by the way.

32:07.492 --> 32:08.112
[SPEAKER_00]: Stupid VHS.

32:10.642 --> 32:13.265
[SPEAKER_00]: We actually did sort of have a conversation via email.

32:13.305 --> 32:17.689
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm thinking the price of the Xbox is definitely going to drop after the release of the PS3.

32:18.269 --> 32:18.930
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, it has to.

32:18.990 --> 32:19.851
[SPEAKER_03]: It has to.

32:20.371 --> 32:22.293
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's only with... Microsoft's going to make any money on it.

32:24.875 --> 32:31.902
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, he sent a... Oh, crap, I lost the email.

32:32.162 --> 32:32.902
[SPEAKER_00]: I apologize.

32:34.204 --> 32:34.764
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually...

32:36.181 --> 32:37.621
[SPEAKER_00]: Sega Launches New Operations Arm

32:59.588 --> 33:09.411
[SPEAKER_00]: Sega is back in the amusement game operations business and they plan to grow that part of their empire by building on the purchase of GameWorks, which has now reemerged from bankruptcy protection.

33:10.331 --> 33:13.231
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm very glad to hear someone still gives a shit about the arcades.

33:13.432 --> 33:14.592
[SPEAKER_03]: Honestly, this is great news.

33:14.612 --> 33:16.472
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, Sega's always kicked ass in the arcades.

33:16.632 --> 33:22.934
[SPEAKER_02]: And to touch on the skee-ball thing, the only reason why that game sucks is because your phone doesn't spit out tickets.

33:25.591 --> 33:35.296
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a quote in here saying, The asset purchase of GameWorks, a premier location-based entertainment destination, provides a platform for Sega to lead the amusement and facilities market domestically.

33:35.636 --> 33:36.977
[SPEAKER_00]: They're actually focusing on the U.S.

33:37.037 --> 33:37.337
[SPEAKER_00]: market.

33:38.638 --> 33:38.858
[SPEAKER_03]: Huh.

33:39.618 --> 33:39.938
[SPEAKER_03]: Interesting.

33:40.159 --> 33:47.402
[SPEAKER_00]: Another quote in here, Blending Japanese culture with American creativity has resulted in some of the most compelling, innovative, and popular products in the world.

33:47.902 --> 33:50.704
[SPEAKER_00]: SEUI also has the added advantage of tapping...

33:51.204 --> 33:56.008
[SPEAKER_00]: Sega's manufacturing expertise, all to deliver consumers an unparalleled entertainment experience.

33:57.649 --> 33:58.189
[SPEAKER_00]: What else we got?

33:59.570 --> 34:06.235
[SPEAKER_00]: Also got more email from actually one of our fellow podcasters, Bobby Blackwolf.

34:06.896 --> 34:07.576
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, that guy.

34:07.776 --> 34:08.377
[SPEAKER_03]: He's got a good show.

34:09.077 --> 34:13.200
[SPEAKER_00]: Just talking about... I have to find the email again.

34:13.220 --> 34:13.681
Okay.

34:15.125 --> 34:16.346
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't do it for a couple weeks.

34:16.366 --> 34:18.528
[SPEAKER_03]: You get disorganized.

34:18.568 --> 34:25.333
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I mentioned it on their three-hour show about him listening to our podcast while playing on the Xbox 360.

34:25.373 --> 34:27.975
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought that was pretty cool.

34:28.235 --> 34:32.218
[SPEAKER_00]: You can get your iPod to work through the Xbox 360 while you're playing any game.

34:32.238 --> 34:35.340
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought that was pretty cool.

34:36.621 --> 34:40.404
[SPEAKER_00]: If a game has a crap soundtrack, you can listen to whatever you want to.

34:43.446 --> 34:43.666
[SPEAKER_03]: Awesome.

34:44.286 --> 34:47.167
[SPEAKER_03]: I was going to plug his website, but I suddenly lost the URL.

34:47.207 --> 34:51.228
[SPEAKER_03]: But I know it's in our web link section on our website, OrangeLawnsRadio.com.

34:51.308 --> 34:52.889
[SPEAKER_03]: So check it out.

34:53.049 --> 34:53.969
[SPEAKER_03]: It's cool.

34:56.690 --> 34:57.370
[SPEAKER_03]: Wait, I got it.

34:57.830 --> 34:58.250
[SPEAKER_03]: Here it is.

34:58.310 --> 35:01.291
[SPEAKER_03]: It's allgames.com slash podcast.

35:01.311 --> 35:01.531
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

35:01.551 --> 35:02.772
[SPEAKER_03]: Allgames.com slash podcast.

35:02.872 --> 35:03.812
[SPEAKER_03]: How did you beat me to that?

35:03.832 --> 35:04.792
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I had the email open.

35:04.832 --> 35:05.432
[SPEAKER_03]: You suck.

35:05.472 --> 35:06.793
[SPEAKER_03]: Allgames.com slash podcast.

35:07.113 --> 35:07.413
[SPEAKER_03]: Check it out.

35:09.056 --> 35:10.537
[SPEAKER_03]: He talks about a lot of the same stuff we do.

35:10.698 --> 35:13.941
[SPEAKER_03]: Not that it's the same thing, it's just we have similar interests, so that makes him cool.

35:14.161 --> 35:20.888
[SPEAKER_00]: The very last one, I mentioned this before, RagnarVille, sort of a portal for all free servers for Ragnarok Online.

35:22.629 --> 35:26.313
[SPEAKER_00]: The information is all up on the guy's site.

35:26.853 --> 35:27.714
[SPEAKER_00]: Mark emailed me.

35:28.235 --> 35:31.518
[SPEAKER_00]: So you'd want to go to www.ragnoville.com, check it out.

35:32.560 --> 35:35.684
[SPEAKER_03]: Ragnarok 2 Ragnarok 2

35:48.058 --> 35:48.718
[SPEAKER_00]: The little trailer.

35:48.898 --> 35:52.560
[SPEAKER_00]: That will get me totally off World of Warcraft when Ragnarok 2 comes out.

35:52.700 --> 35:54.321
[SPEAKER_03]: I gotta say, Ragnarok 2 looked pretty hot.

35:55.182 --> 35:58.883
[SPEAKER_03]: Gravity doesn't... Maybe they can't do anything because they're overseas.

35:58.923 --> 35:59.184
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

35:59.204 --> 36:00.324
[SPEAKER_03]: That's kind of interesting.

36:00.604 --> 36:06.007
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the thing is that IRO was actually played out of California, actually.

36:06.247 --> 36:06.767
[SPEAKER_03]: Weird.

36:06.787 --> 36:11.270
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I decided to look up their Better Business Bureau stats for a while.

36:11.590 --> 36:13.771
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah, when all that crap was going down.

36:15.052 --> 36:16.433
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe that's why everybody went underground.

36:16.453 --> 36:26.502
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think that there's any, you know, upon further review, I don't think there's any major problem with listing the free servers out there, because it's technically not hosting the servers.

36:27.242 --> 36:27.983
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, yeah.

36:28.423 --> 36:37.211
[SPEAKER_00]: No, and again, though, that could get some of those servers in trouble if they use that, if, you know, whoever the legal one's in charge, use that as their portal to find these people.

36:38.772 --> 36:39.272
[SPEAKER_03]: I understand.

36:39.292 --> 36:43.574
[SPEAKER_03]: The Ragnarok community is a very tight one and a very rabid one, and it's cool.

36:43.794 --> 36:47.856
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's kind of neat, especially when people are trying to mod the game and do different things with it.

36:48.276 --> 36:49.737
[SPEAKER_03]: But just be careful, guys.

36:49.857 --> 36:52.558
[SPEAKER_03]: Just make sure you're in all your checks and balances legally.

36:52.598 --> 36:53.719
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't want to see you get busted.

36:53.979 --> 36:54.399
[SPEAKER_00]: Have fun.

36:54.559 --> 36:54.940
[SPEAKER_00]: Have fun.

36:55.040 --> 36:57.561
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure your copy doesn't have that pyrite virus.

36:57.601 --> 36:59.022
[SPEAKER_03]: Send Gravity a dollar.

36:59.042 --> 36:59.602
[SPEAKER_03]: They did write it.

36:59.862 --> 37:00.802
[SPEAKER_03]: Send them a dollar, at least.

37:02.003 --> 37:02.263
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

37:03.084 --> 37:03.724
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's it for email.

37:04.304 --> 37:05.025
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's a free mail.

37:05.045 --> 37:07.527
[SPEAKER_03]: To go at OrangeLoungeRadio.com if you want to send us some more.

37:07.567 --> 37:08.587
[SPEAKER_03]: We love getting email.

37:10.289 --> 37:17.814
[SPEAKER_03]: I wanted to mention real quickly about Suikoden V. They're going to get a special edition Suikoden V in Japan.

37:17.834 --> 37:21.137
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course, they always get special editions in Japan, don't they?

37:21.177 --> 37:23.379
[SPEAKER_03]: This is Konami's kind of answer to the Final Fantasy series.

37:23.799 --> 37:25.020
[SPEAKER_03]: Some people say it's better.

37:25.600 --> 37:25.961
[SPEAKER_03]: Who knows?

37:26.761 --> 37:28.162
[SPEAKER_03]: It's really a matter of opinion.

37:28.823 --> 37:32.906
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to come with a 200-page book with character illustrations because, of course...

37:33.446 --> 37:40.889
[SPEAKER_03]: The kind of niche of Suikoden is that you have like 100 different, like what is it, 101 in some games, 108 in others, playable characters.

37:41.749 --> 37:42.970
[SPEAKER_03]: 108, it's 108 stars.

37:43.010 --> 37:44.630
[SPEAKER_03]: I forget, that's like the big catch of Suikoden.

37:45.110 --> 37:53.574
[SPEAKER_03]: They're also going to have an arranged soundtrack, written musical scores, art in the book and everything, fold-out cardboard, art board.

37:54.234 --> 37:56.835
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to be great, so check that out, Suikoden.

37:57.776 --> 37:59.297
[SPEAKER_03]: Will they do the same thing in the US?

38:00.879 --> 38:01.339
[SPEAKER_03]: Probably not.

38:01.619 --> 38:02.280
[SPEAKER_03]: But write Konami.

38:02.320 --> 38:02.921
[SPEAKER_03]: Tell them you want it.

38:03.101 --> 38:03.902
[SPEAKER_03]: You never know what might happen.

38:04.963 --> 38:05.984
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki, you got anything else for us?

38:06.425 --> 38:07.285
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I've got a few things.

38:08.727 --> 38:12.211
[SPEAKER_02]: First off, I was going to mention the...

38:14.497 --> 38:21.699
[SPEAKER_02]: Australia is actually getting the Australian Game Developers Conference 2005 Developing Dreams.

38:22.439 --> 38:39.443
[SPEAKER_02]: The 5th edition of the Developers and Publishers Matchmaking Business Convention will take place on December 5th, 6th, and 7th and will be back to some French and basically they're going to have tons of publishers.

38:39.503 --> 38:42.624
[SPEAKER_02]: Sounds like kind of their version of E3 so to speak.

38:43.224 --> 38:43.284
[SPEAKER_02]: Um

38:44.224 --> 38:49.608
[SPEAKER_02]: including all the big names, you know, Nintendo, Sega, Sony, etc.

38:51.989 --> 38:55.171
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm glad they're getting a little love down there in Australia with all that, so that's good.

38:55.391 --> 38:57.172
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope some of our listeners down there get to go to that.

38:57.613 --> 38:58.773
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, should be pretty cool.

39:00.334 --> 39:00.835
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see.

39:01.475 --> 39:09.440
[SPEAKER_02]: Other things, coming out of the woodwork, of course, it looks like Joystick found a patent for their virtual...

39:11.198 --> 39:12.819
[SPEAKER_02]: Emulation for these old systems.

39:12.859 --> 39:18.403
[SPEAKER_02]: And one of the things that was kind of interesting for it is that you select your character before you select your game.

39:19.884 --> 39:22.646
[SPEAKER_02]: That could be very interesting, playing different characters in different games.

39:22.986 --> 39:25.208
[SPEAKER_02]: Running around as Mario in Zelda or something.

39:25.228 --> 39:25.788
[SPEAKER_03]: Who did this?

39:26.749 --> 39:27.850
[SPEAKER_02]: This is actually a patent.

39:27.890 --> 39:30.992
[SPEAKER_02]: Joystick found it on the US Patent Center.

39:31.012 --> 39:31.752
[SPEAKER_03]: Who owns the patent?

39:32.393 --> 39:32.893
[SPEAKER_03]: Nintendo.

39:33.274 --> 39:33.774
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, Nintendo.

39:33.834 --> 39:34.514
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, okay.

39:34.835 --> 39:37.116
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is supposedly what they're going to be using for...

39:39.198 --> 39:39.719
[SPEAKER_02]: The Revolution

40:02.452 --> 40:05.713
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, you have some release dates for some stuff coming up.

40:05.833 --> 40:06.174
[SPEAKER_03]: I sure do.

40:06.194 --> 40:08.195
[SPEAKER_03]: I have our December release dates for the UK.

40:21.994 --> 40:36.766
[SPEAKER_00]: Call of Duty 2, Gun Cameo, Madden NFL, Need for Speed, Miss One, Perfect Dark Zero, King Kong, Project Gotham Racing 3 Psychonauts

40:39.244 --> 40:51.789
[SPEAKER_00]: Ski Racing 2006, Rugby Challenge 2006, Tiger Woods PGA Tour 2006, Tony Hawk's American Wasteland, Frantics, and also Bubble Bobble Revolution for the DS.

40:51.909 --> 40:52.329
[SPEAKER_03]: Cool!

40:54.109 --> 40:54.750
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep, and Amps 3.

40:55.490 --> 40:57.231
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't even heard of Bubble Bobble Revolution.

40:57.291 --> 40:58.771
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that something we're getting here in the U.S.?

40:58.991 --> 40:59.391
[SPEAKER_03]: I think so.

40:59.631 --> 41:00.732
[SPEAKER_03]: Dude, I want that.

41:01.292 --> 41:02.172
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't care if it sucks.

41:02.232 --> 41:03.053
[SPEAKER_03]: It's Bubble Bobble.

41:04.398 --> 41:04.839
[SPEAKER_03]: Final Fantasy 4

41:19.195 --> 41:23.897
[SPEAKER_02]: Animal Crossing Wild Worlds Animal Crossing Wild Worlds is going to be coming out for the DS.

41:24.117 --> 41:28.119
[SPEAKER_02]: You've got Super Mario Strikers for those people that like those Mario sports games.

41:28.139 --> 41:30.240
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see what else.

41:30.900 --> 41:34.201
[SPEAKER_02]: You've also got a bunch of PSP games, actually.

41:34.221 --> 41:38.603
[SPEAKER_02]: You've got WWE vs. SmackDown 06 coming out for the PSP.

41:39.003 --> 41:43.245
[SPEAKER_02]: As well, of course, Dead or Alive 4 is coming out for the 360, which will be really good.

41:43.725 --> 41:44.926
[SPEAKER_02]: And then some more...

41:46.511 --> 41:50.612
[SPEAKER_02]: There's actually another game coming out on December 14th, Darwinia.

41:50.652 --> 41:53.633
[SPEAKER_02]: It will be available for download for $19.95.

41:53.673 --> 41:54.353
[SPEAKER_02]: Is this US or UK or both?

42:09.520 --> 42:13.182
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, it says 1995 in dollars, so I'm assuming it's American.

42:13.222 --> 42:13.582
[SPEAKER_00]: Very cool.

42:14.563 --> 42:20.025
[SPEAKER_00]: They are actually saying, though, that soon after it's released, there will be a multiplayer version on the way.

42:21.266 --> 42:22.347
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, what is Darwinny all about?

42:22.367 --> 42:23.627
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I'm not very familiar with this one.

42:23.827 --> 42:27.829
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't have too much time to look into it, but I think it's more of a virtual universe.

42:28.590 --> 42:32.452
[SPEAKER_03]: One of our listeners emailed me on this.

42:32.472 --> 42:32.892
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember this.

42:32.912 --> 42:33.312
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember this.

42:33.352 --> 42:33.992
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, great.

42:34.373 --> 42:34.633
[SPEAKER_03]: Cool.

42:35.693 --> 42:36.033
[SPEAKER_03]: Sounds good.

42:36.053 --> 42:36.874
[SPEAKER_03]: What's the website for that?

42:36.994 --> 42:37.294
[SPEAKER_03]: Do we know?

42:37.594 --> 42:38.575
[SPEAKER_03]: I just closed it.

42:38.595 --> 42:38.735
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry.

42:39.415 --> 42:42.197
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, I think the company that makes it is called Steam.

42:43.537 --> 42:44.898
[SPEAKER_00]: Or just Google it.

42:44.998 --> 42:45.598
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure it'll come up.

42:45.638 --> 42:46.159
[SPEAKER_00]: Darwinia.

42:47.219 --> 42:49.461
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki, I noticed you have this up on the screen right now.

42:49.501 --> 42:50.781
[SPEAKER_03]: This is kind of PSP related.

42:50.961 --> 42:52.022
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm really curious about this.

42:52.082 --> 42:53.923
[SPEAKER_03]: Is this the Namco Volume 2 collection?

42:53.943 --> 42:57.565
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep, Namco Battle Collection Volume 2, which has been announced.

42:57.585 --> 43:01.627
[SPEAKER_02]: It has 11 original games and 2 arranged games.

43:02.668 --> 43:06.830
[SPEAKER_02]: And basically, the list of games, we've got King and Balloon.

43:07.911 --> 43:10.913
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, Boskania, or Boskanian or whatever.

43:11.273 --> 43:11.853
[SPEAKER_02]: Bosconian.

43:11.973 --> 43:12.614
[SPEAKER_02]: Bosconian.

43:12.754 --> 43:13.134
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go.

43:13.174 --> 43:13.694
[SPEAKER_02]: Not a mistake.

43:14.134 --> 43:18.957
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, Xevious, uh, Mappy, The Tower of Yraga.

43:18.977 --> 43:21.578
[SPEAKER_03]: How many fucking times do we need to see Mappy though?

43:21.638 --> 43:25.240
[SPEAKER_03]: Seriously, I mean Mappy's been in every Namco collection since the dawn of time.

43:25.300 --> 43:25.921
[SPEAKER_03]: They need to do Mappy Land.

43:26.601 --> 43:30.323
[SPEAKER_03]: I do, Mappy's cool and all, but seriously, I'm done with Mappy.

43:31.083 --> 43:32.644
[SPEAKER_00]: There's one game I'm disappointed that's not in there.

43:32.664 --> 43:32.964
[SPEAKER_00]: What's that?

43:33.165 --> 43:33.865
[SPEAKER_00]: Legend of Valkyrie.

43:35.180 --> 43:41.906
[SPEAKER_02]: Grubda, Dragon Buster, Dig Dug 2, Modos, Rolling Thunder, Dragon Spirit, Pac-Man Arrangement Plus Pac-Man and Modos Arrangement Why would they arrange Modos?

43:41.926 --> 43:42.946
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there a Modos fan club I'm unaware of?

44:05.010 --> 44:13.154
[SPEAKER_02]: But anyways, it's slated for the Japanese market in February 23rd, 2006.

44:13.774 --> 44:24.199
[SPEAKER_02]: It's actually going to be priced at only 3,990 yen, and a lot cheaper than the original game, which was 5,040 yen.

44:24.499 --> 44:30.502
[SPEAKER_02]: And the Japanese release is not yet scheduled, but probably will be soon after.

44:30.582 --> 44:31.402
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm sure we'll get it.

44:32.309 --> 44:32.909
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure we will

44:55.526 --> 44:57.067
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for watching.

44:57.087 --> 44:58.448
[SPEAKER_03]: See you next time.

45:17.639 --> 45:26.041
[SPEAKER_03]: This is interesting because Guitar Hero is actually going to be featured on MTV, which shouldn't be too much of a surprise because you see the MTV logo when you boot up the game.

45:26.421 --> 45:35.862
[SPEAKER_03]: However, they're going to really be whoring out Guitar Hero on MTV on the cable, including MTV, MTV2, the MTV University channel, and MTV.com.

45:36.282 --> 45:39.523
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a partnership between MTV Games and Red Octane.

45:40.723 --> 45:45.024
[SPEAKER_03]: For the first time, rock music is not in the background, but instead it is the game.

45:46.325 --> 45:48.287
[SPEAKER_03]: Quote there from CEO Red Octane.

45:48.427 --> 45:50.268
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you know who their other partnership is with, right?

45:50.508 --> 45:51.069
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, Harmonix.

45:51.089 --> 45:51.790
[SPEAKER_00]: Gibson Guitars.

45:51.950 --> 45:52.450
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, that too.

45:52.890 --> 45:54.552
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

45:55.313 --> 46:02.179
[SPEAKER_00]: Because if you actually look through your unlocks, every guitar in that game is a Gibson guitar down to their classics.

46:03.636 --> 46:06.338
[SPEAKER_03]: Speaking of MTV, I find this very interesting.

46:06.418 --> 46:09.841
[SPEAKER_03]: They are really pushing to get more game-oriented content recently.

46:09.921 --> 46:14.765
[SPEAKER_03]: Not only did they pick this up, but they bought GameTrailers.com.

46:15.066 --> 46:20.590
[SPEAKER_03]: They have assimilated it into its MTV cube or whatever you want to call it.

46:20.670 --> 46:22.091
[SPEAKER_03]: It's interesting.

46:22.212 --> 46:23.733
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice, it'll load even slower now.

46:26.289 --> 46:27.989
[SPEAKER_00]: It's uniqueness will join the collective.

46:29.030 --> 46:29.350
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

46:30.870 --> 46:39.332
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course, you can't play video games all day long because if you played video games all day long, you'd have no time to go out and live a rock and roll lifestyle.

46:39.712 --> 46:51.195
[SPEAKER_03]: So to remind you that there is a world out there outside of video games, DarkSakura is here to present you her advice column, some life tips to just remind you that there's a whole world out there.

46:51.255 --> 46:51.855
[SPEAKER_03]: Go explore it.

46:51.915 --> 46:53.616
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, what are you giving us tips on tonight?

46:53.996 --> 46:56.017
[SPEAKER_00]: Today's tip is how to ram the barricade.

46:56.717 --> 46:58.518
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, like if you're running away from the cops or something?

46:58.979 --> 46:59.319
[SPEAKER_03]: Sort of.

46:59.339 --> 46:59.659
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, cool.

46:59.679 --> 47:01.180
[SPEAKER_00]: Or if you're trying to break into somebody's yard.

47:01.280 --> 47:01.800
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, okay, cool.

47:02.420 --> 47:05.382
[SPEAKER_00]: Number one, identify the barricade's weakest point.

47:05.742 --> 47:12.666
[SPEAKER_00]: The side of the barricade or gate that opens or the place where a lock holds it closed is usually the most vulnerable spot.

47:13.506 --> 47:15.347
[SPEAKER_00]: Number two, aim for the weak spot.

47:15.827 --> 47:19.009
[SPEAKER_00]: If possible, use the rear of your car to ram the weak spot in the barricade.

47:19.449 --> 47:22.331
[SPEAKER_00]: Ramming the front end may damage the engine and cause the car to stall.

47:30.095 --> 47:32.596
[SPEAKER_00]: 3.

47:30.255 --> 47:32.596
[SPEAKER_00]: Accelerate to a speed of 30-45 mph.

47:33.156 --> 47:36.957
[SPEAKER_00]: Jug just before impact if you are heading toward an extremely tall barricade or fence.

47:37.377 --> 47:40.719
[SPEAKER_00]: Pieces of the barricade may come through your window, or the window may shatter.

47:41.519 --> 47:49.442
[SPEAKER_00]: But my final piece of advice, don't try to go ram your way into the Neverland Ranch because Michael Jackson is so not worth it.

47:54.301 --> 47:55.822
[SPEAKER_03]: Womp, womp, womp, Loki!

47:56.323 --> 47:58.724
[SPEAKER_03]: Any closing stories for us tonight, because we're about ready to wrap it up?

47:59.205 --> 47:59.865
[SPEAKER_02]: A few things.

48:00.045 --> 48:02.967
[SPEAKER_02]: Unfortunately, Australia will not be seeing the 360 until March 2nd.

48:03.008 --> 48:04.489
[SPEAKER_02]: Hopefully then they won't overheat.

48:05.649 --> 48:13.435
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, honestly, Australia, I know you're pissed about this, but maybe the consoles will be a little more fine-tuned by the time you get them.

48:14.236 --> 48:18.339
[SPEAKER_02]: If you need a reason why they hate Best Buy even more, apparently it's been...

48:19.122 --> 48:29.541
[SPEAKER_02]: Shown that on numerous occasions, and this is not surprising one bit, they've been lying about how many Xboxes they're getting and employees have been pocketing them and selling them on eBay.

48:30.795 --> 48:31.536
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, snap.

48:31.596 --> 48:32.397
[SPEAKER_03]: That is dirty.

48:32.577 --> 48:33.978
[SPEAKER_03]: That is dirty.

48:33.998 --> 48:42.424
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought it was pretty... I understand the need to get the game systems to your employees as well, but I always thought it was kind of shady when too many of them are going to the employees.

48:42.444 --> 48:51.692
[SPEAKER_03]: You really got to... If there's somebody working for you that just comes in on the weekends, do they really get that same priority that maybe the manager of the store has?

48:51.892 --> 48:52.252
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

48:52.672 --> 48:53.473
[SPEAKER_03]: Kind of interesting.

48:53.813 --> 48:54.214
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

48:54.774 --> 48:57.516
[SPEAKER_02]: I did happen to actually see some of the faceplates that they have for the 360.

48:57.556 --> 48:57.636
[SPEAKER_02]: Ugly.

49:00.319 --> 49:01.600
[SPEAKER_02]: That's all I gotta say.

49:01.960 --> 49:05.381
[SPEAKER_02]: Should not be spending the extra money on faceplates.

49:05.441 --> 49:07.803
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, there were some cool ones we talked about on a previous podcast.

49:07.823 --> 49:09.323
[SPEAKER_03]: Like if you're a Star Wars fan and all that.

49:09.543 --> 49:10.964
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember that from a previous show.

49:10.984 --> 49:11.364
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, okay.

49:11.404 --> 49:12.605
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it comes down to this, folks.

49:12.685 --> 49:16.107
[SPEAKER_02]: If you really want a different faceplate, there are websites out there.

49:16.167 --> 49:19.628
[SPEAKER_02]: I believe Xbox 360 skins or something like that.

49:20.209 --> 49:22.390
[SPEAKER_02]: You can actually design your own.

49:22.990 --> 49:23.970
[SPEAKER_02]: Have it the way you want it.

49:24.231 --> 49:25.911
[SPEAKER_02]: They have some really cool ones on that site.

49:26.031 --> 49:27.032
[SPEAKER_03]: Make an Orange Lounge Radio one.

49:27.743 --> 49:30.645
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought about doing that and don't get ahead of me now.

49:32.126 --> 49:42.614
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the things I thought was pretty cool that they were showing is the development team for the Xbox 360 have gotten their own special edition version of the Xbox, which is pretty badass.

49:42.634 --> 49:48.898
[SPEAKER_02]: They've got concept art as well as just some different green highlights on the controller.

49:49.479 --> 49:50.019
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a neat one.

49:50.219 --> 49:51.820
[SPEAKER_02]: Which is pretty cool, I think.

49:52.161 --> 49:54.462
[SPEAKER_02]: So I wonder how long before we see that on eBay.

49:54.963 --> 49:55.303
[SPEAKER_02]: And then...

49:56.933 --> 50:00.156
[SPEAKER_02]: My favorite thing, which I was just checking this out.

50:01.297 --> 50:07.802
[SPEAKER_02]: Basically, they're going to say that Animal Crossing DS is going to be an extremely well-selling game.

50:08.123 --> 50:11.125
[SPEAKER_02]: They're saying it might actually outsell Nintendogs.

50:12.146 --> 50:19.632
[SPEAKER_02]: And so far, they've indicated that they've pre-sold 300,000 units, which beats out Nintendogs by almost double.

50:19.692 --> 50:19.993
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

50:20.928 --> 50:28.371
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, Mario Kart DS also, and I don't think this came up in any other story, but Mario Kart had a great first week.

50:28.431 --> 50:37.815
[SPEAKER_03]: They say that like 41% of people that own Mario Kart DS went online with it in the first week as compared to 18% went online with Halo 2.

50:38.275 --> 50:41.536
[SPEAKER_02]: And speaking of Nintendogs, they've already sold 1 million in Europe.

50:42.546 --> 50:43.086
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow!

50:43.606 --> 50:44.467
[SPEAKER_02]: One million copies.

50:44.487 --> 50:46.388
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't fed my puppies in a month.

50:46.768 --> 50:47.228
[SPEAKER_03]: Me neither.

50:47.288 --> 50:48.408
[SPEAKER_03]: My doggies are long dead.

50:48.569 --> 50:50.029
[SPEAKER_02]: I am so done with that game.

50:50.569 --> 50:55.632
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the game everybody should check out, which is coming out this week, Mario and Luigi Partners in Time.

50:56.272 --> 50:59.173
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, that's kind of the... Mario and Luigi Super Saga 2.

50:59.613 --> 51:00.454
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's cool.

51:01.434 --> 51:02.054
[SPEAKER_03]: That game was fun.

51:02.154 --> 51:02.634
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a good time.

51:03.255 --> 51:06.256
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe if I can take a break from playing Dragon Quest, I'll check that out.

51:07.617 --> 51:10.598
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, one last story for you guys tonight, and then we'll wrap it up.

51:12.119 --> 51:26.048
[SPEAKER_03]: A study by the Entertainment Software Association says that 31% of Americans plan to engage in a game exchange this year, meaning that somebody's got a game on their Christmas list.

51:26.568 --> 51:29.110
[SPEAKER_03]: So it might not just be the hardcore gamers out there.

51:29.150 --> 51:32.133
[SPEAKER_03]: It sounds like a lot of people out there want to get their hands on a game.

51:32.854 --> 51:39.139
[SPEAKER_03]: They're saying 49% of homes with children aged 12 to 17 will give or get a game this year.

51:40.961 --> 51:49.188
[SPEAKER_03]: Only 43% when we're talking kids under 12, and 22% in a home without children, which I think is still a pretty big number there, so...

51:50.015 --> 51:55.902
[SPEAKER_03]: Gaming is definitely making a bigger and bigger step in our culture here.

51:56.282 --> 51:58.284
[SPEAKER_03]: And finally... No, I had the last say.

51:58.324 --> 51:58.625
[SPEAKER_02]: No!

51:59.145 --> 51:59.546
[SPEAKER_02]: Fine.

52:00.006 --> 52:00.467
[SPEAKER_02]: One last one.

52:00.487 --> 52:01.027
[SPEAKER_02]: God damn it.

52:01.828 --> 52:02.949
[SPEAKER_02]: Listen, I'm done.

52:02.969 --> 52:03.350
[SPEAKER_02]: This is it.

52:03.430 --> 52:04.411
[SPEAKER_02]: The last one.

52:04.491 --> 52:09.837
[SPEAKER_02]: Family Media Guide has released their list of the 10 most ultra-violent video games.

52:10.317 --> 52:12.518
[SPEAKER_02]: that you would want not to buy.

52:12.918 --> 52:16.200
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, in other words, these are the ten games on my Christmas list.

52:16.440 --> 52:17.060
[SPEAKER_02]: Go for it.

52:17.401 --> 52:30.047
[SPEAKER_02]: Resident Evil 4, Grand Theft Auto San Andreas, God of War, NARC, Killer7, The Warriors, 50 Cent and Bulletproof, Crime Life Gang Wars, Condemned Criminal Origins, and True Crime New York City, most of which I own.

52:32.008 --> 52:34.769
[SPEAKER_00]: So why is there a picture of a clockwork orange on there?

52:35.103 --> 52:36.143
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, your final thought

53:02.364 --> 53:05.245
[SPEAKER_00]: Hack, hack, cough, cough, reject false icons.

53:05.865 --> 53:09.225
[SPEAKER_03]: That's going to do it for another week of Orange Lounge Radio To Go.

53:09.425 --> 53:10.426
[SPEAKER_03]: Join us next week.

53:11.446 --> 53:13.926

53:17.687 --> 53:21.308
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the end of another Orange Lounge Radio To Go edition.
