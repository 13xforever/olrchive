00:50.560 --> 00:56.740
calling the wheel of infection or whatever because your

00:56.740 --> 00:58.900
doctor's telling you every week it's something different or something right

00:58.900 --> 01:03.560
it was a cold that turned into a sinus infection while I was in LA because I

01:03.560 --> 01:08.560
came back really sick right and then he told he told me it was bronchitis but a

01:08.560 --> 01:12.480
chance that it was pneumonia and he put on my thing pneumonia and I had an x-ray

01:12.480 --> 01:16.200

you're not feeling it a hundred percent but we appreciate you being here and our

01:26.880 --> 01:29.720
listeners have said they've missed you so as I'm sure you've seen in the mail

01:29.720 --> 01:34.320
bag so is there a man proving they're trying some people out there haven't

01:34.320 --> 01:37.880

01:37.880 --> 01:42.560
them Loki's here as always say hello to Loki I'm here no whooping cough for Loki

01:42.560 --> 01:49.640
No, no, I can't arrange for you to get the plague. How you doing Loki? I'm doing good. Yes

01:49.800 --> 01:54.200
Yes, I'm doing I could be doing better how to have 360 but

01:54.920 --> 01:58.340
I'm still doing good crazy stuff with the 360 launch, huh?

01:58.860 --> 02:02.960
You know nothing I didn't expect. All right, well, we'll talk about 360 stuff

02:02.960 --> 02:06.760
But of course, it's very important to us because you know, we're casual show here

02:06.760 --> 02:07.680
We don't really you know

02:07.680 --> 02:10.000
We're not and we do whatever the heck we want here

02:10.000 --> 02:14.280
And one thing we like to do is tell you about what we've been playing because we are gamers as well

02:14.400 --> 02:17.160
We don't have companies that send us a lot of free stuff

02:17.440 --> 02:22.600
So we have to go out and buy games ourselves and you know, we have real life that you know

02:22.600 --> 02:27.200
We have jobs and stuff, but we do fit in time for gaming when we can dark soccer

02:27.200 --> 02:31.480
Have you been able to fit in any time for gaming? I know you've been sick, but what even playing if anything I played

02:32.200 --> 02:34.740
I played some Katamari last night

02:34.740 --> 02:40.100
a new one or the old one but I got motion sick because my stomach was

02:40.100 --> 02:45.620
already feeling irritated I turned on World of Warcraft and then shut it back

02:45.620 --> 02:51.420
down again because I couldn't stand it's just like because I've been so

02:51.420 --> 02:55.500
disoriented it's been driving me crazy to play anything so I've been taking it

02:55.500 --> 03:01.020
kind of easy with gaming however I did play some PSO blue burst while I was in

03:01.020 --> 03:07.660
L.A., and did watch somebody play through a couple of quests on the Xbox.

03:07.660 --> 03:10.140
And did you get a chance to check out Xbox 360?

03:10.140 --> 03:11.860
Uh, yes, actually.

03:11.860 --> 03:15.920
I didn't play it because I just wasn't feeling well enough, but I got to see Perfect Dark

03:15.920 --> 03:23.140
Zero, which I thought was pretty cool, and then Call of Duty, and then Project Gotham

03:23.140 --> 03:28.140
Racing, and Dan's been playing a whole lot of Need for Speed Underground, so I've actually

03:28.140 --> 03:30.220
seen quite a bit of that.

03:30.220 --> 03:37.140
And he compared it between Xbox and Xbox 360 and said that the 360 version really just

03:37.140 --> 03:38.460
seems like a port.

03:38.460 --> 03:39.580
It's lower.

03:39.580 --> 03:41.780
Not as much fun as the Xbox version.

03:41.780 --> 03:42.780
Interesting.

03:42.780 --> 03:48.020
And I got to see the BSOD on the Xbox 360.

03:48.020 --> 03:49.140
Not the blue screen of death, but...

03:49.140 --> 03:50.820
The black screen of death!

03:50.820 --> 03:51.820
Hahaha.

03:51.820 --> 03:52.820
Alright.

03:52.820 --> 03:55.740
What caused the black screen of death, my ass?

03:55.740 --> 04:01.180
I think it just got hot, but it was it was on the same game that I'm hearing most of the complaints about is on

04:04.580 --> 04:06.580
Call of Duty 2 no on

04:07.260 --> 04:10.940
Project Gotham 3 as I say it's one of the racing games if I remember right yeah

04:10.940 --> 04:17.060
In fact one of our listeners had actually sent us an article about that, but I was gonna say from experience

04:17.060 --> 04:21.320
I've seen it happen, and it was on that game and most of the people I talked to said that it is on

04:21.320 --> 04:28.580
and I want to say GTA but it's it's a project Gotham but aren't they saying

04:28.580 --> 04:32.860
that it's all related to the power supply basically and I know that it's

04:32.860 --> 04:36.740
overheating I don't know exactly why but most of people who run into the problems

04:36.740 --> 04:44.180
are playing with their game in a cabinet I know that's a common factor hmm

04:44.180 --> 04:49.220
anything else you want to share with us dark soccer not particularly all right

04:49.220 --> 04:52.220
Does she want to hear the details of my illness? I doubt think so.

04:52.220 --> 04:54.220
Uh, maybe on another show. Uh, Loki.

04:54.220 --> 05:03.220
Uh, well, I've been, um, I take a little time off this week because of my car and being broken, so...

05:03.220 --> 05:09.220
Meanwhile, while that was being worked out, I've been playing Mario Kart DS, and that's really fun.

05:09.220 --> 05:11.220
Um, I do not like snaking.

05:11.220 --> 05:16.220
Snaking is retarded, and it's a really stupid aspect of the game where people just basically...

05:16.220 --> 05:19.220
you saw the same thing in F-Zero GX where people

05:19.220 --> 05:23.580
they wiggle their cart back and forth or whatever using the drifting or whatever

05:23.580 --> 05:27.560
and it makes it go super fast, a little faster than it should be going in the game

05:27.560 --> 05:31.820
and it's kinda pointless. It's a way of cheating basically. It's basically an exploit

05:31.820 --> 05:32.820
more than anything else

05:32.820 --> 05:36.940
yeah it's retarded so that I have to say but other than that

05:36.940 --> 05:39.660
I'm playing people that don't snake it's still really fun because the games get

05:39.660 --> 05:41.500
really close we played a match earlier today

05:41.500 --> 05:45.940
and man down one race and down the line is just crazy

05:45.940 --> 05:48.580
Yeah, me, you, and Miklotov were all playing a match in the house, right?

05:48.580 --> 05:49.700
Yes, and that was fun.

05:49.700 --> 05:50.380
Good times.

05:50.380 --> 05:53.060
So I really wish there'd be more people on my friends list

05:53.060 --> 05:56.040
popping on during the day, but a lot of times, even doing worldwide,

05:56.040 --> 05:58.780
it's hard to get four players, which is really strange.

05:58.780 --> 06:03.060
I don't know why I'm right into that problem, but I don't know.

06:03.060 --> 06:04.140
So I've been playing that.

06:04.140 --> 06:06.940
I've been playing Grand Theft Auto multiplayer.

06:06.940 --> 06:09.860
I am still owning everybody.

06:09.860 --> 06:12.980
I'm on a five win winning streak right now,

06:12.980 --> 06:16.900
and basically kicking the crap out of all my co-workers it's great

06:16.900 --> 06:20.380
they uh... know that i'm coming to give them the beat down with uh... chainsaw

06:20.380 --> 06:24.900
usually and uh... i'm uh... rocket sniper as well so it's really fun

06:24.900 --> 06:27.700
i wish that game were online cuz that'd be really cool

06:27.700 --> 06:31.340
and then i've been playing shadow of colossus still and i'm bored with that game

06:31.340 --> 06:34.940
i'm ready to be done with it i don't think it's a big huge impressive game

06:34.940 --> 06:36.020
that everyone was saying is

06:36.020 --> 06:38.220
it looks pretty yeah

06:38.220 --> 06:41.220
that's about it there's really no content of the game i gotta be honest i

06:41.220 --> 06:44.040
So I was kind of excited about this game because I heard a lot of good stuff on our forums

06:44.040 --> 06:46.960
and stuff and then you brought the game over for me to check out and you kind of showed

06:46.960 --> 06:50.460
me the game and you were playing it a little bit and I was kind of, it was very pretty

06:50.460 --> 06:53.320
don't get me wrong, the game was very pretty looking and it looked like something I might

06:53.320 --> 06:57.880
want to check out sometime but it just looked a little boring.

06:57.880 --> 06:59.840
I'm not sure I like the concept itself.

06:59.840 --> 07:00.840
It looked a little...

07:00.840 --> 07:01.840
It is boring.

07:01.840 --> 07:02.840
There's no story to it really.

07:02.840 --> 07:05.880
Maybe it's just my perspective and what I look for in a game but it didn't look like

07:05.880 --> 07:08.320
my kind of thing.

07:08.320 --> 07:11.500
I don't like the fact that there's no other enemies, no nothing,

07:11.500 --> 07:14.980
there's no real puzzle. I mean, the only puzzle solving in the game is

07:14.980 --> 07:18.480
figuring out how to get on these colossus and figuring out how to kill them.

07:18.480 --> 07:22.100
But once you're done with that, you're done. And there's only 16 of them in the game.

07:22.100 --> 07:25.900
Granted, there is a hard mode, but when you go through the hard mode and the time modes or

07:25.900 --> 07:26.320
whatever,

07:26.320 --> 07:30.900
you can actually unlock more weapons to make it easier. Why do you want the game to be

07:30.900 --> 07:34.460
easier? It's gonna be shorter. Then they have some point where you can actually kill

07:34.460 --> 07:35.340
lizards and

07:35.340 --> 07:39.160
shoot fruit with like a bow and arrow and stuff but

07:39.160 --> 07:43.460
that doesn't really do anything it's just whoopity-doo here it is

07:43.460 --> 07:46.680
so I don't really know I've kinda lost

07:46.680 --> 07:51.000
purpose in the game. It's fun exploring stuff but there's no benefit to

07:51.000 --> 07:51.560
doing it

07:51.560 --> 07:54.840
like one of the things that people are talking about you can do is climbing

07:54.840 --> 07:59.140
to the top of the temple thing. I haven't tried doing that but that looks

07:59.140 --> 08:01.000
like it could be fun because there's a lot of

08:01.000 --> 08:04.600
area to roam around in but there's no enemy so what's it matter

08:04.600 --> 08:08.760
you know it's it's really bad but I don't know

08:08.760 --> 08:12.760
yet you play it anyway well I just want to get done with it so I can sell it back

08:12.760 --> 08:16.320
oh I see well you're letting me borrow it for a little while right so I can check it out

08:16.320 --> 08:17.100
for a little bit yeah

08:17.100 --> 08:20.760
alright sounds good um but anything else that you've been playing

08:20.760 --> 08:25.280
um I want to play some of the Warriors I haven't got a chance to play any more that

08:25.280 --> 08:27.760
lately but that game I think is going to keep my interest more than anything

08:27.760 --> 08:31.240
some games I've been playing this week I checked out

08:31.240 --> 08:34.320
the Final Fantasy 12 demo and I gotta say I'm pretty impressed

08:34.320 --> 08:38.460
It's, they did change some stuff from what I saw at E3 two years ago in regards to the

08:38.460 --> 08:43.580
battle system because it looks like now with the battle system that you, there's not the

08:43.580 --> 08:47.780
boxes around the screen or anything, it is very seamless where you are walking around

08:47.780 --> 08:52.100
and you, it's unlike other Final Fantasy games in the past, except for XI of course, where

08:52.100 --> 08:55.500
you, I know a lot of people didn't play that, where you walk up to something and engage

08:55.500 --> 08:58.960
it like in real time and it's very different from Final Fantasies of the past.

08:58.960 --> 09:01.440
But I think what's very interesting about the battle system, which is pretty much all

09:01.440 --> 09:05.680
that this demo really allows you to see is the battle system is that you

09:05.680 --> 09:11.840
basically it kind of fuses 11 with the old battle systems which I think is very

09:11.840 --> 09:15.800
interesting because there's a lot about 11 I really did like and the thing is is

09:15.800 --> 09:20.960
that your your party members if you want them to will do their own things and

09:20.960 --> 09:24.760
it's almost like you're playing online with but with intelligent people that

09:24.760 --> 09:27.340
are you know doing the cures as they need to and all this other stuff so it's

09:27.340 --> 09:31.540
very different feel to the Final Fantasy game I noticed. I was a little

09:31.540 --> 09:34.820
disappointed with the summon sequences even though you know they're grand and

09:34.820 --> 09:38.180
overdone like they are in every Final Fantasy game. I was expecting something a

09:38.180 --> 09:41.180
little bit different, a little bit of load time problems there, but nothing

09:41.180 --> 09:48.020
nothing game crippling, just a slight kind of, oh that's too bad. But

09:48.020 --> 09:50.460
otherwise the demo kicked ass. I'm definitely looking forward to the game, I

09:50.460 --> 09:53.980
really want to check it out. My only other minor bitch is that the movie

09:53.980 --> 09:59.620
scenes in the demo were not rendered in the game and look like they are a copy of a movie

09:59.620 --> 10:06.420
because they are pixelated and I can see the pixelation really bad on my TV. I'm sorry.

10:06.420 --> 10:11.340
I'm having microphone problems tonight, sorry guys. It would look very pixelated on my TV

10:11.340 --> 10:14.800
and if that's the way that the game actually looks when it comes out I'm going to be sorely

10:14.800 --> 10:19.460
disappointed. I'm sure this is just because it's the demo. I'm very sure it's just the

10:19.460 --> 10:23.560
demo and the movies will look fantastic but I couldn't help but kind of sense a little

10:23.560 --> 10:30.840
of disappointment because I wanted to see in the demo a little bit that you know nice looking game

10:30.840 --> 10:36.360
you know the rendering sequences and everything so uh also obviously if I got the final fantasy

10:36.360 --> 10:40.520
12 demo I must be playing dragon quest 8 which is true I picked up a copy of dragon quest 8

10:40.520 --> 10:45.400
there's a lot of stuff I really like about dragon quest 8 um it's I'm gonna be honest with you guys

10:45.400 --> 10:50.520
I haven't really been into a dragon warrior or dragon quest game since the very very first game

10:50.520 --> 10:54.600
on the NES I've kind of just slept through the rest of the series I never

10:54.600 --> 10:57.320
played the one that was out on PlayStation I didn't bother to play well

10:57.320 --> 11:00.040
of course a lot of them didn't even come out here I didn't bother to play any of

11:00.040 --> 11:03.840
the other ones on the NES so I kind of dragon quest but I'm for some reason

11:03.840 --> 11:08.800
finding myself really liking this one it's definitely an old style RPG which

11:08.800 --> 11:12.360
is good and you know maybe not good for some people but good for me because it's

11:12.360 --> 11:15.380
definitely a throwback to like the older games where it's like you know the

11:15.380 --> 11:21.520
enemies are there, attack, magic, it's very basic. They don't try to overdo it with all

11:21.520 --> 11:27.740
these crazy concepts or anything during the battle. So I like it. It's a good game. A

11:27.740 --> 11:32.600
lot of good graphics to it. It's got a very different graphical style to it, obviously

11:32.600 --> 11:38.500
because some of the graphics were done by, you know, famous anime guy. The only disappointment

11:38.500 --> 11:42.460
I would say that I have with the game is the cut sequences. There's some cut sequences

11:42.460 --> 11:47.620
in there that are kind of have a lot of low time and the voice acting is very slow and

11:47.620 --> 11:53.540
I find myself wanting to push the X button before the cut sequence finishes usually just

11:53.540 --> 11:57.460
to get through the cut sequences there I usually want to push the X button just to get through

11:57.460 --> 12:01.500
them so I apologize again you guys but I have a crazy mic tonight I might have to pass it

12:01.500 --> 12:06.100
back and forth with somebody else here so the record it's a todiana who did Dragon Ball

12:06.100 --> 12:11.780
Z thank you I yeah I knew he did Dragon Ball Z Dr. Slump and that's the only thing turns

12:11.780 --> 12:15.740
me off by that game I don't like Dragon Ball Z at all but you know a lot of the

12:15.740 --> 12:18.980
character animations are very funny like a lot of the animal a lot of the animals

12:18.980 --> 12:24.080
the monsters are very similar to what you saw in the old Dragon Warrior games

12:24.080 --> 12:26.900
you know the slimes and everything but they do some funny things like they'll

12:26.900 --> 12:30.220
make your characters dance and the dancing motions are hilarious I love it

12:30.220 --> 12:35.860
it's great so yeah I definitely I recommend Dragon Quest 8 if you're a fan

12:35.860 --> 12:39.300
of role-playing games especially if you're looking for like a throwback to a

12:39.300 --> 12:44.680
very old, less complicated RPG type game. A lot of work though. It's not something you

12:44.680 --> 12:48.760
can just play through very quickly and watch the cutscenes. You will die if you don't take

12:48.760 --> 12:52.160
some time to stop and gain experience. And that bugs some people, so I don't know.

12:52.160 --> 12:55.680
Granted though, if you are still looking for a throwback to, you know, really old games

12:55.680 --> 13:01.280
and stuff, especially old RPGs, Wild Arms, Alter Code F, which came out a couple weeks

13:01.280 --> 13:05.220
ago, and Romancing Saga, which came out a couple months ago, which was the original

13:05.220 --> 13:11.340
Soccer Frontier, so both remakes of their original counterparts should be pretty good

13:11.340 --> 13:12.340
too.

13:12.340 --> 13:17.500
And, oh, and, and, and in a couple weeks, Final Fantasy IV.

13:17.500 --> 13:19.900
What's the street date on that, do we know?

13:19.900 --> 13:25.180
Second week, or no, first, wait yeah, second week, second real week in December, so around

13:25.180 --> 13:27.620
the week of the 12th I think.

13:27.620 --> 13:29.260
I'm definitely looking forward to that.

13:29.260 --> 13:32.780
You spoonie bard.

13:32.780 --> 13:36.580
I think we'll start off getting into the news tonight, however, I want to issue a couple

13:36.580 --> 13:41.420
of corrections to things we've talked about on previous podcasts, because, you know, we're

13:41.420 --> 13:44.820
human, we're gaming fans, and we sometimes make mistakes.

13:44.820 --> 13:47.740
This first one isn't so much a mistake as it is a clarification.

13:47.740 --> 13:52.380
A couple of podcasts ago we were talking about Guild Wars, and I said that NCSoft makes Guild

13:52.380 --> 13:56.440
Wars, and somebody over on our forums, a main fan over on the forums, wanted to clarify

13:56.440 --> 14:01.020
that ArenaNet actually made Guild Wars, and they deserve the credit.

14:01.020 --> 14:03.940
NCSoft simply publishes the game.

14:03.940 --> 14:05.700
Which is interesting because it kind of brings up

14:05.700 --> 14:07.400
this whole thing about, you know,

14:07.400 --> 14:09.440
usually it is the publishers that get the credit

14:09.440 --> 14:10.540
because they're the ones that are, you know,

14:10.540 --> 14:11.980
paying for the advertising and all that stuff

14:11.980 --> 14:14.860
that are, you know, really getting the game out there.

14:14.860 --> 14:15.800
True.

14:15.800 --> 14:19.380
So, you know, but I see definitely the point here

14:19.380 --> 14:21.100
that's trying to be made is that, you know what,

14:21.100 --> 14:23.180
we need to give credit to the programmers as well.

14:23.180 --> 14:25.060
So, you know, a lot of times,

14:25.060 --> 14:28.120
and this is probably true of any gaming source

14:28.120 --> 14:29.780
you're looking out there at,

14:29.780 --> 14:33.220
a lot of times the credit is going to the publisher and not necessarily the

14:33.220 --> 14:35.180
company who actually made the game so

14:35.180 --> 14:38.220
I'm definitely willing to issue that clarification there

14:38.220 --> 14:39.980
but just be careful with

14:39.980 --> 14:42.580
what you read out there because sometimes the people who are publishing

14:42.580 --> 14:44.420
the game may not necessarily be making it

14:44.420 --> 14:46.680
a classic example would be Nintendo

14:46.680 --> 14:51.040
publishes a lot of stuff that they don't necessarily do like the old Rare games

14:51.040 --> 14:53.940
you know

14:53.940 --> 14:57.020
something to think about. The other clarification we would like to make was related to

14:57.020 --> 14:59.580
something that we talked about previously last week

14:59.580 --> 15:03.580
and it had to do with the Chinese gamer and the parents were suing Blizzard.

15:03.580 --> 15:08.020
He was not a World of Warcraft player because World of Warcraft wasn't really

15:08.020 --> 15:12.500
out in China until May of this year. It was actually Warcraft 3

15:12.500 --> 15:17.140
was the game that the Chinese gamer committed suicide after playing

15:17.140 --> 15:21.500
and the parents are still suing Blizzard because of it. But of course

15:21.500 --> 15:24.820
this just goes to show, because we get our news from other

15:24.820 --> 15:25.980
sources obviously,

15:25.980 --> 15:28.920
Because there's very few companies that send us releases directly

15:29.920 --> 15:33.160
But it just goes to show that the media will pick it up and run with it

15:33.160 --> 15:37.920
You know about these horrible MMO RPGs that are you know, ruining people's lives and everything

15:37.920 --> 15:42.000
So besides it wouldn't be the first time that Chinese person has killed themself over an MMO. So

15:42.720 --> 15:44.680
Or kill their baby. It's still sad

15:44.680 --> 15:50.100
It's sad depending on the age of whoever the gamer was it's their parent's responsibility to keep an eye on them

15:50.400 --> 15:54.660
And you know, it's really stupid though because like in World of Warcraft you still

15:54.660 --> 16:01.100
Well, I guess it's the same in Warcraft 3. You jump off something you do end up dying if it's high enough

16:01.940 --> 16:04.740
Although the first thing I did was jump off the top of the tree

16:05.220 --> 16:10.740
You know, I have killed myself that way I jumped off a waterfall and I killed myself in World of Warcraft. So it is possible

16:11.940 --> 16:13.940
It's just stupidity

16:14.220 --> 16:15.980
Taking the bad genes out of the gene pool

16:15.980 --> 16:20.520
Well, let's start off with a our first story tonight and I said for tonight's first story

16:20.520 --> 16:26.200
I want to do anything besides an Xbox 360 story just because I'm too oversaturated and believe me

16:26.200 --> 16:30.380
We have plenty of Xbox 360 things to talk about I said anything but an Xbox 360 story

16:31.040 --> 16:34.920
So we have something better. We have a story about 50 cent

16:35.720 --> 16:37.720
He's retarded

16:37.720 --> 16:41.840
50 cent actually has this game 50 cent bulletproof which came out recently and

16:42.560 --> 16:43.560
sexual

16:43.560 --> 16:48.560
Themes intense violence use of drugs blood and gore no surprise. This game has an M rating, right?

16:48.560 --> 16:53.120
Well, guess what Curtis Jackson, also known as 50 Cent, said in a recent

16:53.120 --> 16:57.920
interview with Reuters? Just because it is rated mature doesn't mean you

16:57.920 --> 17:02.200
shouldn't buy it for your kids. No, actually that's what it means. Hold on,

17:02.200 --> 17:05.240
hold on though now, wait a minute, because I think this is where most people stopped

17:05.240 --> 17:10.120
reading and here's what the rest of what 50 Cent has to say.

17:10.120 --> 17:17.120
He said, play the game and explain to them what they are playing. So he's saying

17:17.120 --> 17:19.820
that parents should play the game and then explain to the kids what they are

17:19.820 --> 17:25.640
playing so I think the intentions might be good here I I know I wouldn't let my

17:25.640 --> 17:29.300
kid play this type of game because that's just too much violence and sex

17:29.300 --> 17:33.740
and all that stuff but I do like the fact I think many people pass this off

17:33.740 --> 17:39.020
as 50 cent is crazy but I do like the fact that he is saying parents play the

17:39.020 --> 17:43.940
game with your child parents get involved even though maybe he didn't say

17:43.940 --> 17:47.780
at the right way I at least kind of give him a little bit of credit for trying to

17:47.780 --> 17:51.100
say that the parents should be involved although maybe he wasn't I don't know

17:51.100 --> 17:55.600
but what do you think I think what he's saying is oh my god my game was

17:55.600 --> 18:00.220
released one week after true crime New York City it's not gonna sell very well

18:00.220 --> 18:06.780
kids please buy my game because I need the money he's just not thinking that's

18:06.780 --> 18:12.340
all it is he's I thought he was like you can use this as a teaching tool and you

18:12.340 --> 18:22.500
You know, maybe it could be a teaching tool of sorts, but in the real world, kids are

18:22.500 --> 18:28.460
just going to go, oh, 50 Cent said I should play this violent game, blah, blah, blah,

18:28.460 --> 18:29.460
blah, blah.

18:29.460 --> 18:30.460
Whatever.

18:30.460 --> 18:35.540
I, I wouldn't be surprised if they'd taken him completely out of context in this interview,

18:35.540 --> 18:37.060
because you know that stuff happens all the time.

18:37.060 --> 18:40.060
Loki, you wouldn't know anything about being taken out of context in an interview.

18:40.060 --> 18:42.540
Isn't it so much fun?

18:42.540 --> 18:45.540
Shhh...

18:45.540 --> 18:48.180
Alright, uh...

18:48.180 --> 18:51.180
I guess now we can talk a little bit about Xbox 360.

18:51.180 --> 18:55.700
Let's talk about this. I don't know if you knew this, but Microsoft is

18:55.700 --> 18:58.680
taking a hundred twenty six dollars.

18:58.680 --> 19:02.020
They're writing it off for every Xbox 360 system they sell.

19:02.020 --> 19:05.780
And while this may sound shocking, it actually isn't that uncommon because the

19:05.780 --> 19:08.780
gaming companies really make their money back on the games.

19:08.780 --> 19:11.060
So just so you know, if you wanted to know

19:11.060 --> 19:13.460
how much of a loss Microsoft's taken on these consoles,

19:13.460 --> 19:15.620
$126, and that doesn't count, you know,

19:15.620 --> 19:16.820
when you throw in all these peripherals.

19:16.820 --> 19:20.100
This is just the console itself, so kinda interesting.

19:20.100 --> 19:23.740
Microsoft also saying that they are aware of the shortages

19:23.740 --> 19:26.900
and they are pushing to, and this is a quote

19:26.900 --> 19:29.260
from Peter Moore, the corporate vice president

19:29.260 --> 19:32.800
of worldwide marketing and publishing, said,

19:32.800 --> 19:35.300
our goal is to replenish inventory

19:35.300 --> 19:36.920
in the channel every week.

19:36.920 --> 19:40.280
So lots of Xbox 360s are flowing in every single week.

19:40.280 --> 19:42.160
It's not like we're shipping and then going dry

19:42.160 --> 19:43.760
for two or three weeks.

19:43.760 --> 19:45.320
Loki, you have anything to add to this mess?

19:45.320 --> 19:49.840
Yeah, basically, he's quoted saying,

19:49.840 --> 19:51.160
and I just saw this earlier,

19:51.160 --> 19:52.280
because they basically,

19:53.560 --> 19:55.680
they're not gonna be short at all

19:55.680 --> 19:56.720
with what's coming out here.

19:56.720 --> 19:57.720
Man, I wish I had the article.

19:57.720 --> 19:58.560
Oh, here we go.

19:59.880 --> 20:02.120
Basically, Major Nelson,

20:02.120 --> 20:05.920
the guy who's behind a lot of this launch stuff,

20:05.920 --> 20:15.480
He was visiting his family here on the East Coast and he says he took the opportunity

20:15.480 --> 20:20.020
over the past couple of days to stop at various retailers in southern New England to check

20:20.020 --> 20:22.660
out what people are saying about the Xbox 360.

20:22.660 --> 20:26.820
One thing I noticed was that there was a large amount of incorrect information floating around

20:26.820 --> 20:28.620
regarding shipments of units.

20:28.620 --> 20:33.500
One store incorrectly told me that Microsoft won't send us anymore until March.

20:33.500 --> 20:39.740
I double checked with the retail team and while I can't speak to each retail outlet's

20:39.740 --> 20:46.420
specific distribution strategy, I can tell you that we have a weekly replenishment strategy.

20:46.420 --> 20:51.360
That means that we have new shipments of Xbox 360s being sent out each week.

20:51.360 --> 20:55.500
If you hear that a store won't be getting an Xbox 360 from Microsoft until next year,

20:55.500 --> 21:02.260
you may want to gently remind them that your source, in fact, that we are shipping consoles

21:02.260 --> 21:03.260
each week.

21:03.260 --> 21:07.100
story is be patient once again don't believe all the rumors you hear so

21:07.100 --> 21:13.940
that's that's a good point from the horse's mouth I let you know these Xbox

21:13.940 --> 21:17.180
360s have been reporting crashing in dark soccer you saw one of these things

21:17.180 --> 21:24.820
crash you know to be perfectly honest we got the BS OD once and then after that I

21:24.820 --> 21:28.580
actually just saw it freeze without anything just completely froze in the

21:28.580 --> 21:32.980
the middle of a race.

21:32.980 --> 21:35.460
Now, apparently you can actually fix these crashing

21:35.460 --> 21:36.700
Xbox 360s.

21:36.700 --> 21:39.620
This was something that was posted over on GameSpot forums

21:39.620 --> 21:42.020
that you can actually fix it with string.

21:42.020 --> 21:45.900
All you have to do, hang it from above the ground.

21:45.900 --> 21:48.000
Because the problem is that in these cabinets and stuff,

21:48.000 --> 21:49.140
they're overheating.

21:49.140 --> 21:51.540
Because there's no way for it to effectively cool down.

21:51.540 --> 21:53.220
The power supply is overheating.

21:53.220 --> 21:54.700
I cleared that up.

21:54.700 --> 21:57.260
But the problem is the power supply is it does have a fan.

21:57.260 --> 22:01.260
And like any console, you want to keep it perfectly ventilated.

22:01.260 --> 22:03.260
This is also with a computer or anything.

22:03.260 --> 22:05.260
You just need proper ventilation around it.

22:05.260 --> 22:10.260
But they say place in either that or like suspending on a box lid or something like that,

22:10.260 --> 22:14.260
like a small box, just to basically give some airflow around it.

22:14.260 --> 22:16.260
So the power supplies are overheating.

22:16.260 --> 22:18.260
They have fans inside of them, but they're not that strong.

22:18.260 --> 22:23.260
Also, the fact the console unit itself, they said that there's ventilation holes

22:23.260 --> 22:25.260
that aren't getting punched out during manufacturing

22:25.260 --> 22:29.420
and that could also lend to overheating as well.

22:29.420 --> 22:32.860
Um, actually they had a lot of the same

22:32.860 --> 22:36.460
issue. I remember when the Dreamcast was released saying that it was overheating.

22:36.460 --> 22:41.340
Um, well uh, what we used to do was we actually had a

22:41.340 --> 22:44.940
a box set out until we started using our PS2 as a Dreamcast stand

22:44.940 --> 22:49.700
and uh, letting it air out. Because all you have to do is keep those vents

22:49.700 --> 22:53.340
uh, free of any obstruction and it does just fine. You know what, some

22:53.340 --> 22:56.860
third-party company and it's gonna come out just like they did with the original PlayStation

22:56.860 --> 22:59.620
remember the fan that straps to the side of it and blows air through it

22:59.620 --> 23:03.020
so it doesn't overheat it. Maybe the same thing could

23:03.020 --> 23:07.000
you know set the power supply in something and it cools it off. Or maybe you could not release a

23:07.000 --> 23:08.180
console that overheats

23:08.180 --> 23:13.060
how about that? Yeah that might be good. I tell you they're falling into the Dreamcast trap.

23:13.060 --> 23:18.260
Be very interesting to see. We wouldn't want a system to fail like the N-Gage

23:18.260 --> 23:22.620
and DarkSakura you have something about the N-Gage right? This made me smile

23:22.620 --> 23:27.100
Nokia shifts focus from gaming.

23:27.100 --> 23:30.300
And how long did this take them?

23:30.300 --> 23:33.540
Nokia's VP of Corporate Strategy,

23:33.540 --> 23:37.180
I guess I'm pronouncing this right, Antti Vasara, has

23:37.180 --> 23:41.380
confirmed that there are no plans for future versions of the N-Gage.

23:41.380 --> 23:44.660
They are turning their focus toward mobile TV

23:44.660 --> 23:48.780
and music with the introduction of handsets like the N91

23:48.780 --> 23:51.860
smartphone that can hold up to 3,000 music tracks.

23:51.860 --> 23:57.060
they're planning on placing a greater emphasis on mobile gaming in 2007

23:57.060 --> 24:00.940
which by that time screen sizes and quality were all for better games.

24:00.940 --> 24:04.780
And also the other thing is they're going to be introducing, they don't want

24:04.780 --> 24:08.140
just one platform dedicated to gaming, they're actually going to be incorporated

24:08.140 --> 24:09.940
into all their M60 phones

24:09.940 --> 24:14.340
which will be coming out so that's another reason why that they

24:14.340 --> 24:18.340
shouldn't be supporting the N-Gage. Well the quote I have from him is,

24:18.340 --> 24:22.660
Engage is still being sold, but it was not success in the sense of developing a new category

24:24.060 --> 24:26.060
Engage we bid thee farewell

24:30.380 --> 24:32.380
Wow, oh

24:32.540 --> 24:37.180
Darn, what a loss. Sorry. I I think we've been doing this for like 45 weeks now

24:37.180 --> 24:40.680
And I haven't yet to use the soundboard for anything. So I had to do that

24:40.680 --> 24:48.680
I'm sorry, the N-Gage was crappy. I tried to like this system so bad. I tried to play it at E3.

24:48.680 --> 24:50.680
You have an N-Gage?

24:50.680 --> 24:52.680
And we gave it away.

24:52.680 --> 24:53.680
It's bad.

24:53.680 --> 24:55.680
It was the first model TacoPhone.

24:55.680 --> 25:02.680
Alright. Speaking of something that should be sent far, far away, something about Jack Thompson

25:02.680 --> 25:06.680
and I don't like bringing this guy up every week, but you got something funny.

25:06.680 --> 25:15.320
yeah actually one of our regular listeners Rob with two B's he's actually

25:15.320 --> 25:20.600
sent me several articles and one of them I thought was about time Jack Thompson's

25:20.600 --> 25:26.480
Alabama license was revoked he had been basically shipped out before you know

25:26.480 --> 25:31.200
while they reviewed it but his license is actually gone he cannot practice law

25:31.200 --> 25:36.120
in the state of Alabama that just goes to show you boys and girls do not fuck

25:36.120 --> 25:44.140
with the gaming community yeah but he don't sue me of course he fired back at

25:44.140 --> 25:49.120
a judge more by claiming that the judge had violated the Alabama canons of

25:49.120 --> 25:54.280
judicial ethics by his unfortunate improper and prejudicial prejudiced I'm

25:54.280 --> 25:59.480
sorry prejudicial acts in this case at the expense of three bereaved Alabama

25:59.480 --> 26:04.500
families oh let me guess he's an activist judge you know what I think is

26:04.500 --> 26:08.920
because there's somebody with some common sense in my home state, excuse me, who thought

26:08.920 --> 26:11.520
that you were a big loser. How about that?

26:11.520 --> 26:17.700
Too many practices, mainly out of Florida. Oh, who cares. Sorry to any of our listeners

26:17.700 --> 26:18.700
in Florida.

26:18.700 --> 26:23.860
Moving on, Loki, what else do you have for us?

26:23.860 --> 26:29.860
Well, other than overheating Xboxes, we're hearing reports of scratching disks in the

26:29.860 --> 26:35.420
Xbox as well. Some people are saying, don't play your Xbox vertical. Some are saying don't

26:35.420 --> 26:40.700
play it horizontal. Some people are just saying don't play it at all. But basically, no matter

26:40.700 --> 26:45.540
what you do, your disc will get scratched. Basically the moral of the story is don't

26:45.540 --> 26:50.080
tip your Xbox over while you're playing it. It goes to show you that it really rushes

26:50.080 --> 26:54.340
the market if they haven't found out, oh, these detrimental things. Hey, this is scratching

26:54.340 --> 26:59.820
discs. Maybe that's not a good feature they put in there. So that was kind of interesting

26:59.820 --> 27:05.980
The other one that I thought was kind of funny is they were talking about the Xbox 360 DVD

27:05.980 --> 27:06.980
player.

27:06.980 --> 27:13.160
They're saying it's not very good, actually, and funny, neither was the Xbox's DVD player.

27:13.160 --> 27:15.060
No progressive scan, excuse me?

27:15.060 --> 27:16.060
It says on...

27:16.060 --> 27:17.820
Not nearly as awful as the PS2.

27:17.820 --> 27:24.360
They're testing it on episode 3 and said it looked this decent, but this person who was

27:24.360 --> 27:28.180
reviewing it, their Samsung progressive player blew it out of the water.

27:28.180 --> 27:30.180
No, it sounds like no progressive on this one either.

27:31.180 --> 27:35.180
You've got to be kidding me. No, I swear I read an article that said they had it.

27:36.180 --> 27:39.180
I'm sure some listener is going to email us one way or the other.

27:40.180 --> 27:44.180
You know what, you shouldn't be using your video game system as a DVD player anyway.

27:45.180 --> 27:46.180
Well, some of us are cheap.

27:47.180 --> 27:54.180
You know what, you can go to Sam's Club and pay $50 and get a DVD player that will do everything you need it to do.

27:54.180 --> 28:00.300
you need it to do. And finally, with every video game system launch, there's always going

28:00.300 --> 28:07.300
to be a campaign to put Linux on it. That's right! Free60, the Free60 project, is aiming

28:09.380 --> 28:16.380
to put Linux, such as Darwin, on the Xbox 360 and they've gathered lots of useful, detailed

28:17.700 --> 28:22.660
information surrounding inner workings of the 360. For example, apparently the Xbox

28:22.660 --> 28:29.300
360 is secured down by the following a flash that's encrypted with a per box key and then

28:29.300 --> 28:33.660
they have this key stored inside the CPU and yada yada yada basically they're figuring

28:33.660 --> 28:38.760
out how this thing works i've said from the start putting a game on the hard drive with

28:38.760 --> 28:43.020
the 360 is a dumb idea because you're just gonna be able to reverse engineer that and

28:43.020 --> 28:49.940
voila homebrew so um you know although i've kind of made fun of the people that install

28:49.940 --> 28:54.900
Linux on systems in the past. Honestly, I do get the point of this when it comes to

28:54.900 --> 28:59.380
the Xbox 360, because it does open the door to all this neat homebrew stuff. It's when

28:59.380 --> 29:03.300
you try to install Linux on like a toaster and a Billy Bass that I kind of go, what?

29:03.300 --> 29:06.460
Hey, it's been done! Or a Speak and Spell, I know it's been done.

29:06.460 --> 29:11.540
It's like, you know, come on. What is the practical, I mean, what are you going to run

29:11.540 --> 29:19.500
on a Billy Bass? No, somebody just did that because they could. Anyway. Anyways. Dark

29:19.500 --> 29:21.500
Sucker you have a story for us about Harry Potter

29:22.220 --> 29:28.980
Yes, cuz I actually just saw the movie this week. I so happy I decided to see rent instead actually

29:28.980 --> 29:34.100
And I do want to see Harry Potter, but I I want it. I'm thinking of that song. I want America

29:34.100 --> 29:36.100
I want the kids to be good

29:36.740 --> 29:39.780
You know and I couldn't help but think about that the whole time. I was watching though

29:39.780 --> 29:43.100
I I'm gonna get hate mail over this I hated red. I thought it was awful

29:43.100 --> 29:46.500
I just I was the whole time I was sitting there going get a job get a job

29:46.500 --> 29:48.980
I still want to see it or get AIDS

29:50.580 --> 29:54.800
Moving on this supposed to be a retailing. What was the blah blah him? Yeah

29:55.940 --> 29:59.260
Yeah, but then they never mind. I don't okay back to game

30:00.580 --> 30:02.580
How do you put that?

30:03.740 --> 30:11.060
Electronic arts released a one-level demo for the movie tie-in for Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire and it's available for download

30:12.140 --> 30:13.860
I

30:13.860 --> 30:18.700
Actually, I'm not sure if it's on EA site. I know that they have a link to it from a Eurogamer

30:20.260 --> 30:25.300
So I would suggest go there click on the article about the Harry Potter demo and give it a download because it's supposed to be

30:25.300 --> 30:27.180
pretty cool I

30:27.180 --> 30:29.180
saw it for like

30:29.220 --> 30:32.300
Half a minute at e3 and I was like that looks kind of neat

30:32.300 --> 30:35.940
I did I did play like Harry Potter DS for like two seconds

30:35.940 --> 30:40.980
And I just knew that you I did the little spell thing with the stylus and I thought that was kind of funny

30:41.060 --> 30:43.060
So, I don't know. I

30:43.060 --> 30:48.020
I don't buy a lot of the movie tie-ins unless it's really good, like Street Fighter II,

30:48.020 --> 30:49.240
the movie, the game.

30:49.240 --> 30:50.240
Just kidding.

30:50.240 --> 30:51.240
That sucked.

30:51.240 --> 30:52.240
I have that on my maim.

30:52.240 --> 30:53.240
It's bad.

30:53.240 --> 30:57.120
You know, I think I have that somewhere in a box for Saturn.

30:57.120 --> 30:58.120
I'm sorry.

30:58.120 --> 30:59.120
It's awful.

30:59.120 --> 31:02.640
I think we bought it because it was a dollar.

31:02.640 --> 31:08.280
Let's go over to ye olde mailbag, and I'm sure we've got plenty of emails.

31:08.280 --> 31:09.680
Dark Soccer's gotta catch us up tonight.

31:09.680 --> 31:14.680
If you want to send us an email to go at OrangeLoungeRadio.com is a place to send an email.

31:14.680 --> 31:18.680
The Lovely Dark Soccer will read your email and make fun of your grammar.

31:18.680 --> 31:20.680
Well, I do that anyway.

31:20.680 --> 31:21.680
I do that for free.

31:21.680 --> 31:23.680
What do we got?

31:23.680 --> 31:29.680
Well, just a couple more articles sent to us by our friend Rob, who is not you.

31:29.680 --> 31:31.680
One about the PS3 pricing.

31:31.680 --> 31:33.680
I actually read through this article.

31:33.680 --> 31:36.680
It's a bit long to cover for the podcast.

31:36.680 --> 31:43.200
I briefly read the article and it was on a CNN money actually and I think they

31:43.200 --> 31:47.320
retracted the statement too. I think I heard about that they retracted that a little later so

31:47.320 --> 31:52.360
don't believe anything you hear until like E3. This is fairly recent but they were

31:52.360 --> 31:57.280
talking about with the DVD formats the different high-definition formats being

31:57.280 --> 32:03.160
supported by Sony and Microsoft bringing back sort of like the old Betamax VHS

32:03.160 --> 32:11.720
war goody-goody beta max was better by the way stupid VHS we actually did sort

32:11.720 --> 32:15.440
of have a conversation via email I'm thinking that the price of the Xbox is

32:15.440 --> 32:19.800
definitely gonna drop after the release of the ps3 oh it has to 60 it has to

32:19.800 --> 32:30.880
yeah it's only the next office gonna make any money on it also he sent a wrap

32:30.880 --> 32:37.860
I lost the email I apologize um I actually did also get a notice from him

32:37.860 --> 32:43.720
about skeeball licensed for the mobile phone like skeeball like throwing the

32:43.720 --> 32:46.720
ball and landing it in the Rings yeah why would you play this on your mobile

32:46.720 --> 32:49.400
phone why would you play bejeweled on your mobile why why would you play

32:49.400 --> 32:55.280
bowling on your mobile phone or golf I guess whatever okay now this one had me

32:55.280 --> 32:58.920
all excited Sega launches new operations arm

32:58.920 --> 33:03.900
Sega is back in the amusement game operations business and they plan to grow that part of

33:03.900 --> 33:08.900
their empire by building on the purchase of Gameworks, which has now re-emerged from bankruptcy

33:08.900 --> 33:09.900
protection.

33:09.900 --> 33:14.000
I'm very glad to hear someone still gives a shit about the arcades, honestly, this is

33:14.000 --> 33:15.000
great news.

33:15.000 --> 33:19.960
Well Sega has always kicked ass in the arcades, and to touch on the skee-ball thing, the only

33:19.960 --> 33:25.760
reason why that game sucks is because your phone doesn't spit out tickets.

33:25.760 --> 33:30.380
There's a quote in here saying the asset purchase of Gameworks, a premier location-based entertainment

33:30.380 --> 33:34.620
destination, provides a platform for Sega to lead the amusement and facilities market

33:34.620 --> 33:35.620
domestically.

33:35.620 --> 33:40.380
They're actually focusing on the U.S. market.

33:40.380 --> 33:44.040
Another quote in here, blending Japanese culture with American creativity has resulted in some

33:44.040 --> 33:47.940
of the most compelling, innovative, and popular products in the world.

33:47.940 --> 33:53.580
SEUI also has the added advantage of tapping Sega's manufacturing expertise, all to deliver

33:53.580 --> 33:59.980
consumers an unparalleled entertainment experience what else we got also got

33:59.980 --> 34:05.900
more email from actually one of our fellow podcasters all right be black

34:05.900 --> 34:12.460
wolf oh that guy he's got a good show I just talking about uh I have to find

34:12.460 --> 34:17.820
email and we don't do it for a couple ways to get disorganized it's actually

34:17.820 --> 34:20.860
is mentioning I think I mentioned it on their three-hour show about him

34:20.860 --> 34:25.860
listening to our podcast while playing on the Xbox 360 I thought that's pretty

34:25.860 --> 34:31.320
cool. Oh right on. But yeah you can get your iPod to work through the Xbox 360

34:31.320 --> 34:36.040
while you're playing any game. That was pretty cool. Very cool thank you. Yes you

34:36.040 --> 34:39.760
can actually if a game has you know a crap soundtrack you can listen to

34:39.760 --> 34:46.620
whatever you want to. Awesome. I was gonna plug his website but I suddenly lost the

34:46.620 --> 34:50.260
URL but I know it's it's in our web links section on our website orange

34:50.260 --> 34:57.940
on his radio.com so check it out it's it's cool wait I got it I got the here

34:57.940 --> 35:03.300
it is it's a games.com thank you all games.com slash podcast how did you beat

35:03.300 --> 35:07.220
me to that is that email you suck all right I'll get so close my guess check

35:07.220 --> 35:11.300
it out he talks about a lot of the same stuff we do and not that it's the same

35:11.300 --> 35:14.220
thing it's just you know we have similar interests so that makes them cool the

35:14.220 --> 35:18.860
very last one I mentioned this before ragnaville sort of a portal for all free

35:18.860 --> 35:25.860
servers for Ragnarok online. The information is all up on the guy's site. Mark emailed

35:27.580 --> 35:32.580
me. So you'd want to go to www.ragnaville.com. Check it out.

35:32.580 --> 35:37.420
Huh. And gravity hasn't done anything about this?

35:37.420 --> 35:40.220
I haven't heard of gravity doing anything about it.

35:40.220 --> 35:43.540
Do they just not care anymore because they got Ragnarok 2 on the horizon? Which, by the

35:43.540 --> 35:47.060
way, you showed me that demo, or that, not the demo, the movie of Ragnarok 2. That looks

35:47.060 --> 35:48.140
pretty hot.

35:48.140 --> 35:52.140
That will get me totally off World of Warcraft when Ragnarok 2 comes out.

35:52.140 --> 35:56.140
I gotta say, Ragnarok 2 looked pretty hot. Gravity doesn't...

35:56.140 --> 36:00.140
Maybe they can't do anything because they're overseas. I don't know, that's kind of interesting.

36:00.140 --> 36:04.140
Well, the thing is that IRO was actually played out of

36:04.140 --> 36:08.140
California, actually. Weird. Because I

36:08.140 --> 36:12.140
decided to look up their Better Business Bureau stats for a while. Oh yeah, when

36:12.140 --> 36:16.140
all that crap was going down. Maybe that's why everybody went underground.

36:16.140 --> 36:19.780
I don't think that there's any you know upon further review

36:19.780 --> 36:24.220
I don't think there's any major problem with listing the free servers out there because it's technically not

36:25.260 --> 36:27.880
Hosting the servers. Okay. Yeah

36:27.980 --> 36:28.460
No

36:28.460 --> 36:32.980
Again, though that could get some of those servers in trouble if they use that if you know

36:32.980 --> 36:37.380
Whoever the legal ones in charge use that as their portal to find these people. I

36:38.740 --> 36:42.620
Understand the right draw community is a very tight one and a very rabid one and it's cool

36:42.620 --> 36:47.480
And you know, I I think it's kind of neat when especially when people are like trying to mod the game and do different things

36:47.480 --> 36:52.540
With it, but you know, just just be careful guys. Just make sure just make sure you're in all your checks and balances legally

36:52.540 --> 36:54.700
We don't want to see you get busted. Have fun. Have fun

36:54.700 --> 37:00.700
Make sure your copy doesn't have that pyrite virus and gravity a dollar, you know, they did write it send them a dollar at least

37:01.740 --> 37:03.740
Alright, so that's it for email

37:04.700 --> 37:08.780
to go at orange on radio commie if you want to send us some more we love getting email I

37:08.780 --> 37:15.740
I wanted to mention real quickly about Suikoden 5, they're gonna get a special

37:15.740 --> 37:20.460
edition Suikoden 5 in Japan. Of course they always get special editions in

37:20.460 --> 37:23.340
Japan don't they? This is Konami's kind of answer to the Final Fantasy series.

37:23.340 --> 37:27.820
Some people will say it's better, who knows? It's really a matter of opinion.

37:27.820 --> 37:32.700
It's gonna come with a 200 page book with character illustrations because of

37:32.700 --> 37:36.340
course the kind of niche of Suikoden is that you have like a hundred different

37:36.340 --> 37:42.900
Like what is 101 and some games 108 and others playable characters, but 108 it's 108 stars

37:42.900 --> 37:46.700
I forget that's like the big catch this week. Oh, they're also gonna have an arranged soundtrack

37:47.300 --> 37:54.860
Written musical scores art in the book and everything fold out cardboard art board. It's gonna be great

37:54.860 --> 37:56.860
So check that out so he couldn't

37:57.400 --> 37:59.400
Will they do the same thing in the u.s.

37:59.660 --> 38:03.760
Probably likely probably not but right Konami tell them you want it. You never know what might happen

38:03.760 --> 38:05.760
Loki, you got anything else for us?

38:05.760 --> 38:07.760
Yeah, I got a few thanks.

38:07.760 --> 38:21.760
First off, I was going to mention that Australia is actually getting the Australian Game Developers Conference 2005, Developing Dreams.

38:21.760 --> 38:28.760
The fifth edition of the Developers and Publishers Matchmaking Business Convention will take place on December 5th, 6th, and 7th.

38:28.760 --> 38:38.880
7th and we'll be back to some French and basically they're gonna have tons of

38:38.880 --> 38:44.720
publisher sounds like kind of their version of e3 so to speak including all

38:44.720 --> 38:52.360
the big names you know Nintendo's Sega and Sony etc oh good I'm glad they're

38:52.360 --> 38:55.320
getting a little love down there in Australia with all that so that's good I

38:55.320 --> 38:58.200
hope I hope some of our listeners down there get to go to that yeah should be

38:58.200 --> 39:04.400
pretty cool um let's see other things coming out of the woodwork of course um

39:04.400 --> 39:11.880
looks like that a patent joystick found a patent for their virtual emulation for

39:11.880 --> 39:14.800
these old systems and one of the thing that was kind of interesting for it as

39:14.800 --> 39:20.120
that you select your character before you select your game which is that could

39:20.120 --> 39:23.120
be very interesting playing different characters in different games running

39:23.120 --> 39:27.800
around as Mario and Zelda or something who did this this is actually a patent

39:27.800 --> 39:34.800
joystick found it on the US patent. Who owns the patent? Nintendo. Oh, Nintendo, ok. So

39:34.860 --> 39:41.020
this is supposedly what they're going to be using for the revolution, which is quite interesting.

39:41.020 --> 39:44.180
So you could play other characters in the game, well that would be nothing but a simple

39:44.180 --> 39:47.580
sprite mod for a lot of those old games, so that would be kind of interesting. Yeah, so

39:47.580 --> 39:54.580
it should be interesting. Let's see how that comes about. Also, it was announced that Sony

39:54.580 --> 40:01.580
going to be debuting the PS3 at Consumer Electronics Show 2006, which should be interesting.

40:02.580 --> 40:05.580
Maybe they'll debut when they're releasing the price as well.

40:05.580 --> 40:08.580
That would be nice. Some more specs on it would be nice to hear.

40:08.580 --> 40:09.580
Yeah, seriously.

40:09.580 --> 40:10.580
We'll see.

40:10.580 --> 40:14.580

41:28.000 --> 41:34.600

41:34.600 --> 41:40.860
WWE vs. Smackdown 06 coming out for the PSP. As well, of course, Dead or Alive 4 is coming

41:40.860 --> 41:47.040
out for the 360 which will be really good and then some more niche stuff

41:47.040 --> 41:54.360
Tokobots coming out for the PSP as well as there's some other stuff oh of course

41:54.360 --> 41:58.560
the biggest game of the month would be gauntlet seven sorrows and that's pretty

41:58.560 --> 42:03.680
much it there's actually another game coming out on December 14th um darwinia

42:03.680 --> 42:08.760
for down it will be available for download for 1995 is this u.s. or UK or

42:08.760 --> 42:14.840
both actually it says $19.95 in dollars so it's American very cool they are

42:14.840 --> 42:18.320
actually saying though that soon after it's released there will be a

42:18.320 --> 42:22.600
multiplayer version on the way now what is that winning all about because I'm

42:22.600 --> 42:25.600
not very familiar with this one I didn't have too much time to look into it but I

42:25.600 --> 42:30.800
think it's more of a virtual universe one of our somebody brought this up one

42:30.800 --> 42:34.880
of our listeners okay I remember this I remember this okay great cool

42:34.880 --> 42:38.760
sounds good what's the website for that do we know I just closed that's right

42:38.760 --> 42:42.040
actually if you go to I think the company that makes it is called steam

42:42.040 --> 42:48.400
okay so if you I guess we're just google it I'm sure Darwinia uh Loki I noticed

42:48.400 --> 42:51.320
you have this up on the screen right now this is kind of PSP related I'm really

42:51.320 --> 42:54.800
curious about this is this the Namco volume 2 collection Namco battle

42:54.800 --> 43:00.080
collection volume 2 on which has been announced as 11 original games and 12 or

43:00.080 --> 43:07.080
are two arranged games and basically the list of games we've got a king and balloon, boscania,

43:09.560 --> 43:16.560
bosconian, azevious, mappy, the tower of uraga. How many fucking times do we need to see mappy

43:21.200 --> 43:27.600
though seriously? Mappy's been in every Namco collection since the dawn of time. Mappy's

43:27.600 --> 43:32.180
cool and all, but seriously, I'm done with Mappy. There's one game I'm disappointed that's

43:32.180 --> 43:37.300
not in there. What's that? Legend of Valkyrie. Hmm, let's see, Grubda, looks like that's

43:37.300 --> 43:43.840
in there, Dragon Buster, we've got Dig Dug 2, Motos. Dig Dug 2, by the way, highly underrated.

43:43.840 --> 43:49.240
I actually like Dig Dug 2. I don't know why more people don't. Motos, Rolling Thunder,

43:49.240 --> 43:54.440
Dragon Spirit, and then for the ranged games, we have Pac-Man Arrangement Plus, with a giant

43:54.440 --> 43:59.000
plus sign there so looks like another version of Pac-man and modus arrangement which I've

43:59.000 --> 44:00.000
never played before.

44:00.000 --> 44:01.000
Why did they arrange modus?

44:01.000 --> 44:02.000
I don't know.

44:02.000 --> 44:05.120
Is there a modus fan club I'm unaware of?

44:05.120 --> 44:06.120
But anyways.

44:06.120 --> 44:07.120
Why did they arrange?

44:07.120 --> 44:08.520
Oh I guess they did arrange Digdy.

44:08.520 --> 44:14.300
It's slated for the Japanese market in February 23, 2006.

44:14.300 --> 44:22.520
It's actually going to be priced at only 3,990 yen and a lot cheaper than most of the original

44:22.520 --> 44:29.880
game, which was 5,040 yen, and the Japanese release is not yet scheduled, but probably

44:29.880 --> 44:30.880
will be soon after.

44:30.880 --> 44:31.880
And I'm sure we'll get it.

44:31.880 --> 44:33.540
Oh, I'm sure we will.

44:33.540 --> 44:37.640
But there might be different games in ours, because there was in the Japanese one, too.

44:37.640 --> 44:42.640
But they also got the little restricted symbol over in Japan, too, with bonus games on the

44:42.640 --> 44:47.740
old, they didn't have a five-disc set, they had a six-disc Namco set for the PlayStation

44:47.740 --> 44:54.580
But I didn't get to play Legend of the Valkyrie until I got the HuCard for the PC Engine.

44:54.580 --> 44:55.580
Wow.

44:55.580 --> 45:01.300
I want to do one quick story here on Guitar Hero.

45:01.300 --> 45:04.560
You know this game, Guitar Hero, it's a music game that's really turning some heads just

45:04.560 --> 45:08.580
because of its real powerhouse song list and just kind of really great control.

45:08.580 --> 45:13.740
And of course, I think most of us gave a favorable review on this game on the earlier podcast.

45:13.740 --> 45:17.740
It's pretty cool even if you're not really into music games.

45:17.740 --> 45:21.860
This is interesting because Guitar Hero is actually going to be featured on MTV, which

45:21.860 --> 45:26.000
shouldn't be too much of a surprise because you see the MTV logo when you boot up the

45:26.000 --> 45:27.000
game.

45:27.000 --> 45:31.800
However, they're going to really be whoring out Guitar Hero on MTV on the cable, including

45:31.800 --> 45:36.340
MTV, MTV2, the MTV University channel, and MTV.com.

45:36.340 --> 45:40.780
This is a partnership between MTV Games and Red Octane.

45:40.780 --> 45:45.500
the first time rock music is not in the background but instead it is the game

45:45.500 --> 45:49.800
quote there from a CEO red octane well you know who their other partnership is

45:49.800 --> 45:55.840
with right well harmonics Gibson guitars over that too yeah every I because if

45:55.840 --> 46:00.160
you actually look through your unlocks every guitar in that game is a Gibson

46:00.160 --> 46:06.520
guitar down to their classics speaking of MTV I find this very interesting they

46:06.520 --> 46:10.320
are really pushing to get more game-oriented content recently not only

46:10.320 --> 46:15.320
did they pick this up but they they bought game trailers calm they have

46:15.320 --> 46:21.320
yeah assimilated it into its MTV cube or whatever you want to call it it's

46:21.320 --> 46:29.280
nice a load even slower now it's unique this will join the collective all right

46:29.280 --> 46:34.920
um of course you can't play video games all day long because if you played video

46:34.920 --> 46:39.200
games all day long you'd have no time to go out and live a rock-and-roll lifestyle

46:39.200 --> 46:43.560
So to remind you that there is a world out there outside of video games, Dark

46:43.560 --> 46:49.080
Sakura is here to present you her advice column. Some life tips to just remind you

46:49.080 --> 46:52.680
that there's a whole world out there. Go explore it. Dark Sakura, what are you

46:52.680 --> 46:57.280
giving us tips on tonight? Today's tip is how to ram the barricade. Oh, like if you're

46:57.280 --> 47:01.040
running away from the cops or something? Sort of. Okay, cool. If you're trying to break into somebody's yard.

47:01.040 --> 47:06.200
Oh, okay, cool. Number one, identify the barricade's weakest point. Either the

47:06.200 --> 47:11.600
barricade or gate that opens, or the place where a lock holds it closed, is usually the

47:11.600 --> 47:13.000
most vulnerable spot.

47:13.000 --> 47:14.000
2.

47:14.000 --> 47:15.840
Aim for the weak spot.

47:15.840 --> 47:19.560
If possible, use the rear of your car to ram the weak spot in the barricades.

47:19.560 --> 47:23.080
Ramming the front end may damage the engine and cause the car to stall.

47:23.080 --> 47:28.760
Unless you hit the rear wheel drive, I have an engine in the back, like a VW, but anyway

47:28.760 --> 47:29.760
I digress.

47:29.760 --> 47:30.760
3.

47:30.760 --> 47:33.200
Accelerate to a speed of 30-45 miles an hour.

47:33.200 --> 47:37.160
Duck just before impact if you are heading toward an extremely tall barricade or fence.

47:37.160 --> 47:41.720
Pieces of the barricade may come through your window, or the window may shatter.

47:41.720 --> 47:47.320
But my final piece of advice, don't go ramming, you know, don't try to go ram your way into

47:47.320 --> 47:51.440
the Neverland Ranch, because Michael Jackson is so not worth it.

47:51.440 --> 47:56.400
Wha wha wha, Loki!

47:56.400 --> 47:59.000
Any closing stories for us tonight, because we're about ready to wrap it up?

47:59.000 --> 48:03.080
A few things, unfortunately Australia will not be seeing the 360 until March 2nd.

48:03.080 --> 48:05.080
Hopefully then they won't overheat.

48:05.080 --> 48:11.020
Yeah, honestly, Australia, I know you're pissed about this, but maybe the consoles will be

48:11.020 --> 48:14.240
a little more fine-tuned by the time you get them.

48:14.240 --> 48:19.680
If you need a reason why they hate Best Buy even more, apparently it's been shown that

48:19.680 --> 48:25.280
on numerous occasions, and this is not surprising one bit, they've been lying about how many

48:25.280 --> 48:29.920
Xboxes they're getting and employees have been pocketing them and selling them on eBay.

48:29.920 --> 48:31.720
Oh, snap.

48:31.720 --> 48:32.720
That is dirty.

48:32.720 --> 48:36.800
is dirty I thought I thought it was pretty you know I understand the need to

48:36.800 --> 48:39.840
get you know the game system to your employees as well but I always thought

48:39.840 --> 48:42.480
it was kind of shady when too many of them are going to the employees you

48:42.480 --> 48:46.520
really gotta you know don't if there's somebody working for you that just comes

48:46.520 --> 48:50.280
in on the weekends you know do they really get that same priority that the

48:50.280 --> 48:54.000
maybe the manager of the store has I don't know kind of interesting I don't

48:54.000 --> 48:57.280
know I didn't happen to actually see some of the face plates that they have

48:57.280 --> 49:05.000
for the 360, ugly. That's all I gotta say. Should not be spending extra money on face

49:05.000 --> 49:06.660
plates. Well, there were some cool ones that we talked

49:06.660 --> 49:10.240
about on a previous podcast, like if you're a Star Wars fan and all that. I remember that

49:10.240 --> 49:12.560
from a previous show. Yeah, okay. Well, it comes down to this,

49:12.560 --> 49:16.480
folks. If you really want a different face plate, there are websites out there, I believe

49:16.480 --> 49:23.300
Xbox 360 skins or something like that, you can actually design your own. Have it the

49:23.300 --> 49:26.080
way you want it. They have some really cool ones on that site.

49:26.080 --> 49:32.180
I thought about doing that and don't get ahead of me now.

49:32.180 --> 49:36.300
One of the things I thought was pretty cool that they were showing is the development

49:36.300 --> 49:41.540
team for the Xbox 360 have gotten their own special edition version of the Xbox, which

49:41.540 --> 49:42.700
is pretty bad ass.

49:42.700 --> 49:50.260
They've got concept art as well as just some different green highlights on the controller,

49:50.260 --> 49:52.260
which is pretty cool.

49:52.260 --> 49:55.060
So I wonder how long before we see that on eBay.

49:55.060 --> 50:01.940
And then my favorite thing, which I was just checking this out, basically they're going

50:01.940 --> 50:08.200
to say that Animal Crossing DS is going to be an extremely well selling game.

50:08.200 --> 50:12.260
They're saying they might actually outsell Nintendogs.

50:12.260 --> 50:18.700
And so far they've indicated that they've pre-sold 300,000 units, which beats out Nintendogs

50:18.700 --> 50:20.980
by almost double.

50:20.980 --> 50:26.320
You know, um, Mario Kart DS also, and I don't think this came up in any other story, but

50:26.320 --> 50:28.480
Mario Kart had a great first week.

50:28.480 --> 50:34.720
They say that, like, 41% of people that own Mario Kart DS went online with it in the first

50:34.720 --> 50:38.380
week as compared to 18% went online with Halo 2.

50:38.380 --> 50:42.080
And speaking of Nintendogs, they've already sold one million in Europe.

50:42.080 --> 50:43.640
Wow.

50:43.640 --> 50:44.640
One million copies.

50:44.640 --> 50:45.640
That's big.

50:45.640 --> 50:46.640
And I haven't fed my puppies in a month.

50:46.640 --> 50:47.640
Me neither.

50:47.640 --> 50:48.640
My doggies are long dead.

50:48.640 --> 50:49.880
I am so done with that game.

50:49.880 --> 50:50.880
Yeah.

50:50.880 --> 50:54.920
game everybody should check out which is coming out this week Mario and Luigi

50:54.920 --> 50:59.320
partners in time oh that's good now that's kind of the Mario Super Saga 2

50:59.320 --> 51:04.160
yeah that's cool that game was fun that's a good time so maybe if I can take

51:04.160 --> 51:09.080
a break from playing Dragon Quest I'll check that out all right one last story

51:09.080 --> 51:13.520
for you guys tonight and then we'll wrap it up a study by the Entertainment

51:13.520 --> 51:20.120
Software Association says that 31% of Americans plan to engage in a game

51:20.120 --> 51:25.640
exchange this year meaning that somebody's got a game on their Christmas

51:25.640 --> 51:29.480
list so it might not just be the hardcore gamers out there it sounds like

51:29.480 --> 51:33.820
a lot of people out there want to get their hands on a game they're saying 49

51:33.820 --> 51:40.080
percent of homes with children aged 12 to 17 will give or get a game this year

51:40.080 --> 51:46.520
only 43 percent when we're talking kids under 12 and 22 percent in a home without

51:46.520 --> 51:51.000
children which I think is still a pretty big number there so gaming is definitely

51:51.000 --> 51:56.880
making a bigger and bigger step in our culture here so all right and finally

51:56.880 --> 52:03.320
oh I had the last day oh I mine one last one damn it listen I'm done this is it

52:03.320 --> 52:08.320
the last one better be family media guide has released their list of the 10

52:08.320 --> 52:13.640
most ultraviolet video games that you would want not to buy and this is oh in

52:13.640 --> 52:17.440
In other words, these 10 games on my Christmas list, go for it.

52:17.440 --> 52:23.680
Resident Evil 4, Grand Theft Auto San Andreas, God of War, NARC, Killer7, The Warriors, 50

52:23.680 --> 52:28.560
Cent and Bulletproof, Crime Life Gang Wars, Condemned Criminal Origins, and True Crime

52:28.560 --> 52:30.720
New York City, most of which I own.

52:30.720 --> 52:35.500
So why is there a picture of a Clockwork Orange on there?

52:35.500 --> 52:37.400
Because I guess they're telling you not to do so.

52:37.400 --> 52:38.400
I don't know.

52:38.400 --> 52:39.400
I don't know why they...

52:39.400 --> 52:42.040
Not to drop acid and make a movie.

52:42.040 --> 52:46.180
Satan would be behind something like that. Okay, I'm done. Yeah, you better be. Final

52:46.180 --> 52:52.420
thought. Loki, you're first. I hope I get my 360 this week. My final thought is I'm

52:52.420 --> 52:56.820
really sorry for the sound problems tonight. This microphone sucks. That's all I can say.

52:56.820 --> 53:00.940
We're going to use our $25 gift card to get a new one. I'm very excited. DarkSakura, your

53:00.940 --> 53:06.780
