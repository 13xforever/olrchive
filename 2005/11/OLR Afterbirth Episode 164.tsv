273	1694	All right, you guys listening live.
1814	2535	It's not over yet.
2575	9640	We still got a little more show for you guys, just for you guys, because we love the folks who take some time out on their Sunday to spend it with us.
9760	10800	We really appreciate that.
11181	13742	So this is the Orange Lounge Radio after birth.
14443	15243	It's just for you guys.
17847	18087	DarkSakura
36178	55707	and then went out to buy lots of Pocky for people in Alabama and then went on to eat dinner at the Hard Rock Cafe and I did school work all the rest of the time and I got my new driver's license and my face is no longer humongous on it because it's 80 pounds less of me.
57168	58108	That was pretty exciting.
58128	59109	Congratulations, yeah.
59729	62970	And so just otherwise getting things ready to go to Alabama.
63551	64371	Looking forward to the trip.
69183	70024	Loki, how was your week?
70044	70424	How was your day?
83032	85113	To finalize how the ceremony is going to go.
86634	89575	And yeah, that's pretty much it.
89775	90996	It's been really busy.
92277	94858	Sorry, I was just making sure the podcast saved okay.
95018	97099	A little bit of Jamie's voice got thrown in there.
97119	97319	Sorry.
98440	100441	So, okay.
101641	104163	My week and my day, it was pretty good.
104383	105643	I just, you know, I...
108652	109593	DarkSakura, DarkDeft, Drew, Carameldansen
131662	132462	Donnie Darko
152185	155946	Yes, ex-girlfriend, is with a cast still over there in San Jose.
156426	157566	And we still talk to each other.
158846	164067	And she wanted to know if I was interested in helping them out because they needed somebody for a role.
164087	166488	And I was like, well, shit, I haven't done Rocky in over a year.
166548	167288	So I went and did that.
167308	168048	And that was a lot of fun.
168328	171448	But the only bummer about that is that I drove back after Rocky was over.
171488	172429	Rocky starts at midnight.
172849	175949	And then so I got on the road at 2.30 and didn't get home until about 5 o'clock.
176989	177389	But oh well.
178830	180290	As long as my body doesn't reject it.
181260	182521	All right, yeah, I knew that would happen.
182561	185063	Somebody in the chat room is going, ha, ha, ha, girlfriend.
185584	191349	Yeah, well, you know, I have a long, sordid past that I'm not going into right now on this radio show.
193370	196953	All right, let's get into the Orange Lounge Radio Cage Match.
196994	201437	This is the part of the show where we play songs for your enjoyment, hopefully.
202939	205701	And you want to be in our chat room if you want to participate.
205741	207563	I know some of you guys like to lurk out there.
207603	208964	You're listening, but you're not in chat room.
209312	209872	And that's fine.
210312	212953	Wait, you have a right to your anonymity.
213874	217595	But if you want to be able to participate and choose the winner, you do have to be in our chat room.
217635	219856	It's over at www.orangelandre.com.
219876	220456	Click on chat.
220756	221516	Let's get it started.
222176	225357	The way a cage match works, we pick three songs for you guys.
225397	229419	You guys pick your favorite, and the winning song goes into rotation all week long.
229799	233140	You're on Orange Lounge Radio's Labani and Video Game Music program.
233740	238782	Last week, DarkSakura won, and she decided to get a little creative and use a song that
239096	239716	Thanks for watching!
268707	279438	Was MC something or something, but I didn't hit save Which MC was that, I couldn't say Wait a minute, was it MC Chicken in the hat?
279538	282100	I remember him, he was a fat dude Wait, was he thin?
282120	292891	Now I know I've seen his video Up on the box with the dirty ass beaks Calling Rooster's car, got a feather like a pimp Swingin' up on the side MC Chicken in the hat got pride But I can't recall if it was in my night
295084	296145	Was it MC Razzle Dazzle?
296165	297226	Was it MC Plain?
297246	299948	Was it MC in the mirror, aka MC Vain?
299988	302289	Was it MC pain in my ears just to listen?
302670	305652	Nah, if it was him, I wouldn't listen Was it MC Elephant?
305672	312377	That would be relevant Because of how my memory got crooked, now it's Halibut Let me think, I'ma figure out What MC are they talking about?
312577	313838	Which MC was that?
313898	320362	I can't recollect I heard him on the internet Was MC Fuss or something, but I didn't hit save Which MC was that?
320402	321043	I couldn't say
325603	329564	Maybe it was MC, matter of fact, he got the authentic, easy riding his act.
329705	331805	Always speaking the truth, never fronts one bit.
331825	333946	He and DJ so sincere, don't quit.
334006	336207	But I think for some reason that it wasn't him.
336427	339568	Wait, was it MC out on a limb with a very risky rapping?
339588	341229	Don't know what happened to the time.
341289	341849	Verbal control.
341949	342610	Thank you for watching!
357836	379386	to be certain, was it MC Hot behind the curtain, calling, pay no attention to the man on the mic, must be a wizard when he runs so tight, you're having difficulty judging out your brain, the fact, which MC was that, which MC was that, I can't recollect, I heard him on the internet, was MC Hot or something, but I didn't hit save, which MC was that, I couldn't say, I couldn't say.
381564	399162	Step up Poindex to act smarter than you are About to pull the MC name out the jar And whoever gets closest wins a nine-sided die And a gift certificate to prize, yo The moniker is MC Front a lot I got a fuss one bag, a nerdcore hip-hop And my mail list busted, a hundred so I'm famous It's unbelievable nobody know what my name is
410363	412527	Alright, that was a clip from song number one.
412567	415250	That was MC Frontalot with which MC was that?
415270	416452	It was last week's winner.
416993	422541	And it just might win again this week, but first, it's got to go up against a couple of other songs.
422581	424083	The first song is going to be my pick.
424724	426066	That's right, I get to pick the next song.
426713	431175	and I decided to pick a song from a free CD I got this week.
431495	437677	I actually ordered some Echo Image CDs from a different drum and I was very happy because there's B-sides and I love new Echo Image songs.
437737	438357	I'm very, very happy.
438617	441338	But they also sent me a free synth pop sampler.
441758	444439	That made me happy, so I got to hear some new stuff, try some different bands out.
444759	445840	And I liked this song.
446220	449541	I love the melody in this song and that's why I'm picking this song.
449581	452042	The singing's a little odd to me, but maybe you guys will like it.
452482	455383	I love the melody and I think it's a great song, so I want to share it with you guys.
455899	459280	My pick for tonight's cage match is a song called Liquid Divine.
459380	463401	I'm sorry, the group is called Liquid Divine, and the song is called Lotus.
463861	465881	So enjoy song number two tonight.
465901	468502	Liquid Divine
485427	486708	Thanks for watching!
516130	525820	We are the souls of decay, and all these years that have passed by, and you bewildered in my eye, and in these seconds satisfied, I really will tell you.
554742	555542	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
586403	593665	We made our icons on the wall To do today's decisions for what we're for Life and death are not to say We are
611773	613095	Thanks for watching!
640289	641312	Thanks for watching!
699472	700272	Thanks for watching!
746892	751634	Song number two in tonight's Cat Age match, that was Liquid Divine with Lotus.
751694	756935	Let's go around and see if the hosts thought it was Divine or just kind of Liquid Poop.
757916	758636	DarkSakura.
759156	760216	Made me sleepy.
760336	761377	It was pretty, though.
761617	763397	All right, Loki.
763557	764258	It was like a seven.
764298	768019	I didn't care for the synthy voices, but the music was good.
768759	773361	That's my problem with this song, too, is I hate the share effect on the voice, like way overdone, like five times.
773661	774621	Like, I think, like, if a...
775519	779200	But see, I think at the same time, like a trance girl singing that would be too cliche.
779700	783380	So I think if the guy had just sang with his normal voice, I bet it would have been like a real kick-ass song.
783680	790642	But for me, the way the synths are done, put it in that very dreamy music to F2 category.
792102	798543	So, you know, since it is the season and everything with Valentine's Day being on Tuesday, I'm going to go ahead and give that song a 9.
798943	800503	Whereas usually I would have given that an 8.
800963	803624	You know, since it fits the holiday, I give myself a bonus point.
804044	804284	Alright.
805893	807674	Alright, Loki, what did you pick for your song tonight?
808555	812958	I picked a song by a group called Evergreen, called The End.
813378	815359	It's completely picked out of random.
815499	818861	I just picked it up completely at random.
819142	820382	I have no idea if it's good or bad.
820602	821763	So, hope it's good.
822203	823644	Will minimal effort pay off?
823684	826926	We'll find out with song number three, Evergreen, with The End.
827187	827867	You're on the Cavematch.
1009299	1010040	Thanks for watching!
1060894	1064175	Song number three tonight, Evergreen with The End.
1064255	1065676	A last minute pick by Loki.
1065996	1067737	Did the last minute-ness pay off?
1067777	1069117	We'll find out, DarkSakura.
1069917	1072798	It sounds like the background music to some sort of airplane game.
1073699	1076860	Um, which I love airplane games, but it was kind of boring.
1077580	1078381	They get the core.
1079221	1079601	Loki.
1080441	1081742	That was a horrible song.
1081942	1083402	I don't know what the hell I was thinking.
1083783	1085743	Sounds like something that would be in the groove, so.
1088164	1088564	I don't know.
1088584	1090145	I have to be sure it'll probably win.
1092937	1101001	I'm gonna be a little bit nicer to the song because I could, I really could see that song like in a video game.
1101041	1105523	My problem with it is that it sounds like it was done on somebody's keyboard in their basement.
1105922	1107182	Thank you for watching.
1107202	1107662	See you next time.
1134019	1135761	in chat to vote for your favorite.
1135801	1138623	Here's a recap in case you're not sure what to vote for tonight.
1138683	1140845	Song number one you can vote for is MC Frontalot.
1141265	1142166	Which MC was that?
1142466	1146990	And song number two you can vote for tonight is Liquid Divine with Lotus.
1164885	1169009	And song number three you can vote for tonight is Evergreen with The End.
1177396	1180539	Late vote now.
1180939	1183461	Send a private message to Sky in the chat room with your vote.
1183521	1186424	And if you don't, you will be flogged repeatedly.
1188105	1189046	Anybody watching the Olympics?
1190134	1190735	I don't watch TV.
1191436	1192217	Not even the Olympics?
1192278	1194522	I know some people that don't give a crap about sports.
1194542	1196465	I wish Mikhail Tav was still here because I know he's one of those people.
1196826	1199892	Doesn't give a crap about sports, but will watch the Olympics when they come on.
1199912	1201034	Because, I don't know, there's something...
1202739	1202999	DarkSakura.com
1232471	1256012	I've loved figure skating all the time because my mom used to do amateur roller skating and I studied it a little bit but really I've just not I do not put TV this is just my opinion of it I'm not saying anyone else says this I don't think of my television as my number one source of entertainment so therefore even though there may be a show I might be interested in or the Olympics or something big going on
1256644	1258205	I don't think of it as TV.
1258285	1260005	I look online for the news.
1261566	1262146	The results.
1263087	1265508	It's never been a big thing to just sit and watch it.
1266528	1268029	Figure skating might be kind of boring this year anyway.
1268049	1269129	I heard Michelle Kwan pulled out.
1269169	1270370	She's always usually the best one to watch.
1271210	1273871	They had a Date My Mom marathon on today.
1274051	1275312	God, please don't tell me you watched that.
1275532	1280734	I watched about two episodes of that because I couldn't reach the remote from where I was sitting.
1280754	1281335	So...
1284014	1287298	It was, um... That show is horribly scripted.
1287658	1291622	I mean, I hate anything that they call reality TV on MTV.
1292043	1296047	Because just, like, the crap that they were making them say was so ridiculous.
1296388	1300372	Like, where they ask them, like, you know... So, what would...
1300868	1302389	Thanks for watching!
1318840	1322243	So, yeah, do you think your son would mind if I gave him a pearl necklace?
1322703	1323724	Oh, that's disgusting.
1323744	1325245	Why would you say that to somebody's mother?
1325405	1330770	And she's like, well, I don't know if he looks good in pearls, but, uh, it was just, like, completely retarded.
1330830	1331731	I mean, come on.
1332571	1339077	There was this other guy who wanted to sniff, like, the mother's, like, armpits because he had this, like, smell fetish thing.
1339177	1339357	Ew.
1340098	1341759	So this is the crap that's on TV.
1342019	1342920	I did like this.
1342960	1343660	You know what, though?
1343781	1346543	There is a very, very famous clip that comes from Date My Mom.
1347631	1349612	Like Harry Potter with a vagina!
1350113	1350813	I love her!
1350853	1351934	That was from Date My Mom.
1352614	1354355	Yeah, it's retarded stuff.
1355816	1358318	I did like the soup in their Curious George.
1359338	1360539	That was great.
1362220	1365282	Oh, they put George W. Bush in instead.
1365322	1365963	That was pretty funny.
1366703	1367564	Yeah, the soup's pretty good.
1367604	1369925	That soup's probably my favorite show on TV.
1369985	1371106	What I like about it is that
1371670	1372490	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1396138	1396618	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1418513	1419754	Ultraviolate.
1422375	1425277	Jamie can appreciate this one because she's a grammar Nazi there.
1425637	1426758	Ultraviolate.
1426818	1428899	The movie is supposed to be ultraviolet, right?
1429499	1430900	They put ultraviolate.
1430920	1434242	There should be a movie called Ultraviolate.
1434262	1435142	It's a porno.
1435522	1438944	I'm sorry that I poked you in your live journal, by the way, speaking of grammar.
1438964	1439525	That's all right.
1439565	1440585	I don't even know what I did.
1440625	1443026	Because you used I as a subject.
1443867	1445548	I gave you a collective eye roll.
1446275	1449196	Because you used I as a subject.
1449436	1449716	Oh, whatever.
1449736	1451836	When you said me and I. Did I really?
1451856	1452817	No, him and I. Oh.
1452857	1453717	You used it as a subject.
1453737	1454517	It should have been him and me.
1454537	1455057	Oh.
1455597	1456057	My bad.
1456838	1458758	Jamie's grammar lesson of the night.
1458798	1459738	Grammar tip of the week.
1460118	1463819	That's what you need on the podcast because you got rid of it.
1463839	1464599	Grammar tip of the week.
1464639	1464860	Yeah.
1464920	1469001	We've got to get rid of the website and get your grammar tip of the week instead.
1469041	1469861	We'll have to think about that.
1470221	1470561	Rock.
1470621	1472461	If we do go on a little break here, maybe that can be something.
1472481	1474982	Remember, an apostrophe does not make it plural.
1476431	1480013	That is very useful for kids that write on web forums and stuff.
1480593	1481894	You need to look into this.
1482234	1484775	I think we have something developing here.
1484795	1486116	We'll see.
1486576	1487457	Or I could do it.
1487557	1490498	It would be ironic if I did it because I have the worst grammar in the world.
1491339	1492219	I've read your email.
1493360	1495181	Yeah, but I write fast.
1495221	1496161	You write good.
1497482	1504125	I write good at work because I'll take time to spell check and grammar check and all that good stuff, but when I'm writing informally as I do in my live journal, I don't bother.
1504926	1505426	It's like, whatever.
1506681	1514788	Alrighty, um, by the way, big thank you to, uh, Bugged, who, uh, I think was the one that pointed that out, um, and made, um, my buddy Jason take a picture of that, so.
1516329	1520613	Um, let's see, oh, yeah, somebody in chatroom says, Skyrite good.
1523295	1525056	I gotta tally up cage match votes here.
1525116	1527098	Somebody's gotta talk about a completely different subject.
1527298	1530301	Loki, do you have any, uh, podcast articles that didn't make the cut tonight?
1531122	1532643	Um, maybe?
1533023	1533443	I don't know.
1533463	1533924	Um,
1535532	1535692	DJ Maxx
1565768	1567409	and Exit for the PSP.
1569070	1570431	Well, Ground Day 3 is for the PS2.
1572193	1572913	What else was there?
1573594	1574634	There was some Yu-Gi-Oh!
1574654	1577637	2 for 1 that was also coming out, but I don't play Yu-Gi-Oh!
1577657	1578617	so who cares?
1579238	1582180	And then, I don't know.
1583421	1593648	Lots of good games coming out in March, including that really crappy game, Dance Factory, the one by Codemasters where you put any CD in and it'll make DDR steps for it.
1593788	1594789	I'm worried about this game.
1595703	1597004	Yeah, it looks like crap.
1598184	1598745	I'm sure it is.
1601006	1604288	And... There's a new Monster Rancher game coming out.
1604568	1605188	Oh, yay!
1605649	1607430	Because, you know, we love those games.
1607550	1610872	And then, um... I don't know.
1611292	1611792	I'm trying to think.
1612432	1613753	Really good games coming out.
1613833	1614754	You don't have to fill time anymore.
1614774	1615254	Bust the move.
1615594	1616155	Bust the move.
1616375	1616795	What?
1616855	1617115	What?
1617295	1617836	What?
1618056	1618856	Oh, never mind.
1618956	1621698	You got me excited for a minute here because I thought we were talking Kitty Yen.
1622378	1622978	No.
1623259	1623499	Bummer.
1626508	1626828	All right.
1627309	1635897	I did also last night, you know, we had those brochures that were pretty cool of that Tango game.
1636217	1637138	Mm-hmm.
1637927	1638347	Xtango?
1638527	1639448	Xtango, yeah.
1639808	1641849	Oh, did that game ever freaking come out?
1641909	1642089	No.
1642509	1649612	But the brochures, they're made out of this, like, weird stuff that I tossed them in my fireplace, and they, like, burst into flames.
1649652	1654673	Like, they blew up, like, Jiffy Pop or something like that, and all of a sudden, boom!
1654693	1657435	There's, like, a huge fire coming out, like, woohoo!
1660556	1660976	Rad!
1661016	1663537	We were burning things last night and playing Scrabble, so that was...
1664447	1665507	Fire and Scrabble.
1665547	1667468	That's like the best way to spend an evening.
1667868	1668408	Then Clue.
1668568	1670169	You know how to fucking party, Loki.
1670409	1671689	By the way, I still have Rob's copy of Clue.
1672250	1675731	God damn it, give it back because Jason hasn't seen it and needs to.
1676571	1677671	So at least I think he told me.
1677691	1679072	You need to watch Advent Children.
1679392	1679612	I know.
1679632	1680672	I'm going to watch Advent Children.
1681933	1688815	As a follow-up to something we talked about, Loki got me a DVD of Advent Children so I could... Speaking of Advent Children, remember I posted the new date on their website.
1688895	1691136	It's coming out April 25th in the U.S.,
1693120	1694221	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1717423	1723765	Loki, for your next fire and scrabble night, Roz says, I heard that strawberry Pop-Tarts burst into flames.
1724545	1725445	Well, I don't have Pop-Tarts.
1725485	1732268	We haven't really burned, like, we just burn our junk mail and whatever paper we have in the house, usually.
1732668	1740430	I've been trying to push for burning the phone book, but for some reason, she doesn't want to burn the phone book.
1741890	1742951	Look at all that fire.
1744022	1745363	Pre-flammable stuff.
1745383	1746924	I mean, it's like the size of a log as it is.
1747004	1748324	That stuff would go up in flames too.
1748384	1751146	Alright, let's reveal tonight's podcast winner.
1751166	1752567	You know it was a... or podcast winner.
1752887	1753868	Cage match winner.
1753888	1755128	I have something else on my brain.
1755789	1756549	Tonight's cage match winner.
1757069	1767415	Very interesting cage match winner situation tonight because we had two songs tied, but one song got one more vote than those two songs.
1767735	1770237	So it was an incredibly close match tonight.
1770597	1772178	So all songs did very well.
1772571	1773732	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1795123	1800326	Just goes to show that it doesn't matter what we think, ultimately the chatroom can do whatever the fuck they want.
1800366	1801426	I think they're just fucking with us.
1801666	1803787	That was our punishment for you doing that, Loki.
1803887	1804588	Good job.
1804888	1806008	Way to ruin it, Loki.
1806849	1807589	Dick.
1807609	1812172	And since Jamie and I won't be here next week, that song by default wins two weeks in a row.
1812532	1813292	Good job.
1814072	1816814	Loki, way you lose at the internet.
1816834	1817214	Kill him.
1818054	1818975	This show is over.
1819035	1820436	This show is over.
1821436	1821896	I'm kidding.
1822257	1822917	Final thoughts.
1825045	1826766	The extra final thoughts, Loki.
1828006	1836609	I need to freaking get out of this goddamn writer's block for my music stuff, because I need to make a song by the March deadline.
1837729	1838650	DarkSakura, your final thoughts.
1839150	1839770	I like mummies.
1841590	1843271	I plugged in mummified cats, remember?
1844491	1850813	Mummified cats are cool, because when they have their wrappings, they actually stitch little ears onto their wrappings.
1851194	1851694	It was cute.
1852134	1852454	Dorky.
1853307	1857631	My final thought is bye, and I'll see you on March 5th.
1857731	1857911	Bye.
1857951	1859312	I'm going to miss you guys.
1859332	1860993	I'm going to miss you.
1861053	1862934	I miss you already, Rob, but my aim's improving.
1862974	1863275	Shut up.
1863615	1865256	I'll see some of our listeners at Katsukon, though.
1865336	1866077	That's going to be exciting.
1866397	1869960	And I have to make flyers for Katsukon because I said I would at some point, so we'll do that.
1870280	1871120	All right, that's it.
1871220	1873042	Here's your fortune cookie message for the day.
1876193	1877854	You're tuned into Orange Lounge Radio.
