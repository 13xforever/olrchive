52
00:08:10,017 --> 00:08:12,179
[SPEAKER_15]: Except for chips and salsa, but that's kind of borderline.

53
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:17,443
[SPEAKER_15]: Have you ever had the chips and salsa at Chipotle?

54
00:08:17,703 --> 00:08:19,084
[SPEAKER_15]: Because they have lime chips.

55
00:08:19,585 --> 00:08:21,766
[SPEAKER_15]: Like, their chips have just a hint of lime.

56
00:08:22,147 --> 00:08:22,487
[SPEAKER_14]: No.

57
00:08:23,147 --> 00:08:24,449

00:08:31,995 --> 00:08:34,296
[SPEAKER_05]: They have good carnitas at Felipe's by my house.

61
00:08:35,337 --> 00:08:37,459
[SPEAKER_15]: Is that a mom-pa type place, Felipe's?

63
00:08:56,934 --> 00:08:57,674

64
00:08:58,014 --> 00:08:58,615
[SPEAKER_15]: I know we should.

65
00:08:58,795 --> 00:08:59,575
[SPEAKER_15]: Because I love Grandma.

[SPEAKER_15]: She's so sweet.

67
00:09:01,036 --> 00:09:02,616

00:09:06,598 --> 00:09:07,118
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't remember.

70
00:09:07,138 --> 00:09:07,858
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't know.

71
00:09:07,878 --> 00:09:08,939
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm sure someone in chat will tell me.

72
00:09:08,959 --> 00:09:09,239
[SPEAKER_15]: Anyway.

73
00:09:09,759 --> 00:09:11,420

[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, so you are 34.

83
00:09:30,228 --> 00:09:31,548
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure, yeah, whatever.

84
00:09:32,389 --> 00:09:32,869
Just kidding.

85
00:09:33,009 --> 00:09:33,950
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, hey, they don't know.

86
00:09:34,110 --> 00:09:35,130
[SPEAKER_15]: That's always the joke about me.

87
00:09:35,150 --> 00:09:35,851
[SPEAKER_15]: Everybody says, you're 30.

88
00:09:36,011 --> 00:09:36,811
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm like, I'm not 30.

89
00:09:36,971 --> 00:09:38,352
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm good at being 30.

00:09:39,733 --> 00:09:40,933
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

91
00:09:42,054 --> 00:09:42,254

[SPEAKER_15]: By the way, guys, I'm using the microphone tonight that sucks.

94
00:09:50,168 --> 00:09:51,129
[SPEAKER_15]: I just want everybody to know.

95
00:09:51,230 --> 00:09:53,773
[SPEAKER_15]: So, if I cut in and out, deal with it.

96
00:09:54,692 --> 00:09:54,873
[SPEAKER_05]: Aw.

[SPEAKER_15]: As usual.

106
00:10:15,730 --> 00:10:16,231
[SPEAKER_15]: As usual.

107
00:10:16,331 --> 00:10:18,713
[SPEAKER_15]: Because it wouldn't be a show if we couldn't have some dick and fart jokes.

108
00:10:18,933 --> 00:10:19,694
[SPEAKER_05]: And musical burping.

[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway!

159
00:18:58,085 --> 00:18:59,166
[SPEAKER_04]: LED guys, get it?

160
00:19:01,467 --> 00:19:02,288
[SPEAKER_04]: You're gonna do that?

161
00:19:04,569 --> 00:19:04,890
[SPEAKER_15]: Forget it.

162
00:19:07,151 --> 00:19:10,113
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, so, um, nothing much other than that.

163
00:19:11,376 --> 00:19:13,017
[SPEAKER_04]: I had a party in there last night.

164
00:19:13,557 --> 00:19:14,797
[SPEAKER_04]: I got lots of digital toys.

165
00:19:15,317 --> 00:19:15,577
[SPEAKER_04]: Yay.

166
00:19:15,617 --> 00:19:16,918
[SPEAKER_04]: That's cool.

167
00:19:17,778 --> 00:19:21,019
[SPEAKER_15]: Now, I was a bad friend because I didn't have a chance to go out today.

168
00:19:21,199 --> 00:19:33,803
[SPEAKER_15]: I actually went to, but the sad thing is I was at the mall for like five minutes, but most of that time was spent trying to find a parking space because my friend really wanted to go and run in and get something, and it totally escaped my mind.

169
00:19:33,843 --> 00:19:35,223
[SPEAKER_15]: I was like, I was going to get Angel something.

170
00:19:36,244 --> 00:19:37,524
[SPEAKER_15]: So I'll have a present for you later.

171
00:19:37,904 --> 00:19:38,064
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure.

172
00:19:38,124 --> 00:19:39,505
[SPEAKER_15]: It'll just make your birthday last longer.

173
00:19:39,525 --> 00:19:39,925
[SPEAKER_15]: Sure.

174
00:19:39,965 --> 00:19:40,585
[SPEAKER_15]: You can put it that way.

175
00:19:40,885 --> 00:19:42,366
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm gonna whack you with a bug net.

176
00:19:55,586 --> 00:19:56,667
[SPEAKER_04]: But I could do that in real life.

177
00:19:57,588 --> 00:19:59,169
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, yeah, you don't live that far from me, do you?

178
00:20:00,990 --> 00:20:01,511
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, here's a rock.

179
00:20:01,551 --> 00:20:02,631
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to chop down your tree.

180
00:20:04,973 --> 00:20:06,514
[SPEAKER_04]: Throwing rock across this highway.

181
00:20:06,615 --> 00:20:06,895
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, wait.

182
00:20:07,715 --> 00:20:08,496
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, yeah.

183
00:20:09,577 --> 00:20:13,520
[SPEAKER_15]: Anywho, well, happy birthday from us at OLR to you.

184
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:15,800
[SPEAKER_15]: I think we need to sing to Angel, everybody.

185
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:19,781
[SPEAKER_15]: We need to sing happy birthday to Angel, Orange Lounge Radio style, okay?

186
00:20:19,961 --> 00:20:20,782
[SPEAKER_15]: Ready, everybody?

187
00:20:21,382 --> 00:20:23,282
[SPEAKER_15]: Alright, give the mic to Loki so he can help out.

188
00:20:23,342 --> 00:20:23,922
[SPEAKER_15]: Alright, here we go.

189
00:20:25,163 --> 00:20:26,743
[SPEAKER_15]: One, two, three.

190
00:20:27,263 --> 00:20:30,924
[SPEAKER_09]: Happy birthday to you.

191
00:20:31,704 --> 00:20:35,065
[SPEAKER_09]: Happy birthday, fuck you.

192
00:20:35,865 --> 00:20:39,926
[SPEAKER_09]: Happy birthday, fuck Angel.

193
00:20:39,966 --> 00:20:40,366
[SPEAKER_15]: In a good way.

194
00:20:40,993 --> 00:20:46,175
[SPEAKER_09]: Happy birthday, fuck you.

195
00:20:47,595 --> 00:20:48,976
[SPEAKER_15]: I got a platinum record for that.

196
00:20:49,136 --> 00:20:50,977
[SPEAKER_05]: Somebody shoot the singer.

197
00:20:53,057 --> 00:20:54,398
[SPEAKER_05]: I should totally be a loud singer.

198
00:20:55,939 --> 00:20:58,780
[SPEAKER_09]: Happy birthday, fuck you.

199
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:00,460
[SPEAKER_09]: How was your week?

200
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:03,101
[SPEAKER_15]: How was your day, DarkSakura?

201
00:21:03,161 --> 00:21:08,023
[SPEAKER_05]: I spent most of the week having the plague, but I decided that it might be the T-virus.

202
00:21:09,460 --> 00:21:10,681
[SPEAKER_15]: Like, isn't that what AIDS is?

203
00:21:11,141 --> 00:21:12,142
[SPEAKER_15]: No!

204
00:21:12,182 --> 00:21:15,744
[SPEAKER_15]: Those are T-cells.

205
00:21:16,124 --> 00:21:18,465
[SPEAKER_09]: I pity the foo who don't understand the difference.

206
00:21:19,166 --> 00:21:22,948
[SPEAKER_05]: No, the T-virus was the zombie virus in Resident Evil in the first game.

207
00:21:24,209 --> 00:21:38,261
[SPEAKER_05]: So I figured that if you ever start seeing Itchy Tasty show up on my live journal, like the entry before that would be Ugly Face So Shot Him, and then the next one Itchy Tasty, then you'd know that I turned into a zombie.

208
00:21:38,621 --> 00:21:40,943
[SPEAKER_05]: And then of course I'd be in here eating everybody's brains.

209
00:21:41,503 --> 00:21:43,004
[SPEAKER_15]: Are you sniffing my spicy brains?

210
00:21:44,145 --> 00:21:45,887
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I wasn't sniffing your spicy brains.

211
00:21:48,257 --> 00:21:53,378
[SPEAKER_05]: So, um, but I did have fun yesterday because I felt kind of better and I had already made plans.

212
00:21:54,039 --> 00:22:06,842
[SPEAKER_05]: So, um, I went over to, uh, our friend Tia's house to, uh, make dinner, which I made chicken and green beans, which I will post pictures of in the chat room because she took pictures of the food I cooked.

213
00:22:06,862 --> 00:22:07,562
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought it was sweet.

214
00:22:08,382 --> 00:22:11,383
[SPEAKER_05]: And then me and her and her roommate went to the thrift store.

215
00:22:12,123 --> 00:22:15,264
[SPEAKER_05]: But on the way there, we were sort of like in the ghetto part of town that we, uh,

216
00:22:15,817 --> 00:22:19,598
[SPEAKER_05]: Saw Popeye's fried chicken and ate fried chicken in my car while listening to The Cure.

217
00:22:22,659 --> 00:22:25,020
[SPEAKER_05]: Fried chicken and biscuits with The Cure.

218
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:28,741
[SPEAKER_15]: Friday, I'm in love with a chicken wing.

219
00:22:29,541 --> 00:22:31,762
[SPEAKER_05]: No, it's like listening to pictures of you.

220
00:22:33,755 --> 00:22:36,618
[SPEAKER_05]: with eating, chowing down on fried chicken.

221
00:22:36,878 --> 00:22:39,260
[SPEAKER_15]: What's that commercial that uses pictures of you?

222
00:22:40,681 --> 00:22:41,382
[SPEAKER_05]: Do I watch TV?

223
00:22:42,563 --> 00:22:44,164
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm asking hypothetically.

224
00:22:44,224 --> 00:22:45,125
[SPEAKER_15]: It's the Kodak, right?

225
00:22:45,345 --> 00:22:46,206
[SPEAKER_15]: No, that's two colors.

226
00:22:46,246 --> 00:22:47,807
[SPEAKER_15]: They show that before the movies, too.

227
00:22:47,988 --> 00:22:49,008
[SPEAKER_15]: No, that was like in the 80s.

228
00:22:49,088 --> 00:22:50,550
[SPEAKER_15]: That's the last time you probably watched TV.

229
00:22:52,712 --> 00:22:55,914
[SPEAKER_15]: The Kodak thing, they show this in the movies, too, you know, and they have the pictures of you.

230
00:22:56,075 --> 00:22:56,555
[SPEAKER_15]: I think it is.

231
00:22:56,575 --> 00:22:57,376
[SPEAKER_15]: It might be a digital camera.

232
00:22:57,416 --> 00:22:57,696
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't know.

233
00:22:57,876 --> 00:22:59,858
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't ever see the cursor laying out like that.

234
00:23:20,805 --> 00:23:24,587
[SPEAKER_05]: And there's another picture of me and her with cowboy hats, which I will post in the chat room in a moment.

235
00:23:24,767 --> 00:23:28,590
[SPEAKER_15]: I think that's going to be your new picture on whatever Orange Lounge Radio album art we switch to.

236
00:23:28,650 --> 00:23:29,330
[SPEAKER_05]: No, no, no, no.

237
00:23:29,590 --> 00:23:31,891
[SPEAKER_05]: I have to have the one in the plaid beanie, which I have to go back and buy.

238
00:23:33,246 --> 00:23:33,466
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

239
00:23:33,486 --> 00:23:35,187
[SPEAKER_05]: But, um, the Plaidbury thing.

240
00:23:35,247 --> 00:23:42,309
[SPEAKER_15]: Because we're all going to have new pictures, and there's a... Did I even tell you guys about the new intro for the podcast that's coming?

241
00:23:42,349 --> 00:23:45,611
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Rob, for keeping us in the loop and making executive decisions.

242
00:23:45,631 --> 00:23:53,173
[SPEAKER_15]: I totally forgot about... You said that we could have potentially one, but that person is doing it, for sure.

243
00:23:53,333 --> 00:23:56,775
[SPEAKER_15]: But we have to screen it when it's done to make sure we like it, of course.

244
00:23:57,515 --> 00:23:57,755
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

245
00:23:59,856 --> 00:24:00,376
[SPEAKER_09]: See, you knew.

246
00:24:02,975 --> 00:24:03,435
[SPEAKER_15]: Liar!

247
00:24:03,455 --> 00:24:06,318
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh my god, Jamie's trying to fuck with me.

248
00:24:06,358 --> 00:24:07,059
[SPEAKER_15]: She is a zombie.

249
00:24:07,119 --> 00:24:07,619
[SPEAKER_09]: Off with her head!

250
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:08,240
[SPEAKER_09]: Off with her head!

251
00:24:08,380 --> 00:24:08,681
[SPEAKER_15]: Kill her!

252
00:24:12,124 --> 00:24:12,945
[SPEAKER_05]: Butt!

253
00:24:14,386 --> 00:24:15,207
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes, I do have a butt.

254
00:24:15,267 --> 00:24:15,908
[SPEAKER_15]: It's very nice.

255
00:24:16,808 --> 00:24:17,469
[SPEAKER_05]: It's very big.

256
00:24:18,010 --> 00:24:18,170
[SPEAKER_15]: Hey!

257
00:24:20,026 --> 00:24:25,792
[SPEAKER_15]: It's time like these, you guys are glad we don't have the OLR webcam, because I just showed my butt to Jamie.

258
00:24:26,033 --> 00:24:30,397
[SPEAKER_15]: I didn't show the skin, but I showed my jeans.

259
00:24:30,778 --> 00:24:35,583
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm wearing tight jeans today, because my butt did get bigger, therefore my jeans are tighter.

260
00:24:35,603 --> 00:24:36,544
[SPEAKER_15]: Those are

261
00:24:37,204 --> 00:25:04,822
[SPEAKER_05]: I had the coolest jeans though in the 80s because you remember during the Samantha Fox days how it was really cool to have all ripped up jeans Naughty girls need love too Well I, my mom would not let me cut my jeans, I was so pissed off so I went roller skating and I ran into the wall And back then at the roller rink the wall was made out of carpet And that carpet burned the knees out of my jeans

262
00:25:05,422 --> 00:25:06,462
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

263
00:25:35,738 --> 00:26:00,809
[SPEAKER_05]: um but back to uh my life yes i remember being young in the 80s maybe just maybe naughty girls need love too it's one of my favorite songs ever i do not like big butts i'm trying to get rid of mine

264
00:26:01,949 --> 00:26:08,014
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh my god, well I'll talk about it during my, I made a I Like Big Butts reference this weekend, but anyway, I'm sorry, I'll get to it later.

265
00:26:08,154 --> 00:26:17,321
[SPEAKER_05]: I also found out during the whole time that I've had my degenerative disease that I dropped something like 16 pounds during the month of November.

266
00:26:17,341 --> 00:26:18,462
[SPEAKER_05]: Oops.

267
00:26:19,383 --> 00:26:20,304
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I couldn't eat.

268
00:26:20,324 --> 00:26:24,447
[SPEAKER_15]: Which is funny because I bet that makes you the biggest loser and you weren't even playing the game.

269
00:26:25,067 --> 00:26:25,648
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I wasn't.

270
00:26:28,117 --> 00:26:32,901
[SPEAKER_05]: I also found out that I really like eggnog flavored things, like eggnog ice cream, because I had some last night.

271
00:26:33,181 --> 00:26:37,905
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, the eggnog stuff that they do at like Starbucks and stuff, the eggnog lattes and stuff.

272
00:26:37,925 --> 00:26:38,785
[SPEAKER_05]: They do this at my work.

273
00:26:39,786 --> 00:26:40,827
[SPEAKER_15]: Good shit.

274
00:26:41,467 --> 00:26:45,430
[SPEAKER_05]: And, and, and, and, and, the eggnog ice cream at Baskin Robbins.

275
00:26:45,930 --> 00:26:49,453
[SPEAKER_05]: This stuff is the best thing ever, because I love ice cream.

276
00:26:53,236 --> 00:26:54,837
[SPEAKER_05]: Excuse me, that was my latte saying hi.

277
00:26:56,488 --> 00:26:59,269
[SPEAKER_15]: Anything else you want to share about your week and your day in the 80s?

278
00:26:59,409 --> 00:27:01,029
[SPEAKER_05]: I did really shitty homework all day.

279
00:27:01,330 --> 00:27:03,590
[SPEAKER_05]: And then after the show, I'm going to go home and do more.

280
00:27:05,071 --> 00:27:05,751
[SPEAKER_05]: I just thought I'd let you know.

281
00:27:05,971 --> 00:27:06,231
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

282
00:27:06,711 --> 00:27:07,352
[SPEAKER_15]: What kind of homework?

283
00:27:07,732 --> 00:27:10,172
[SPEAKER_05]: Illustrator this morning, Dreamweaver when I get home.

284
00:27:11,093 --> 00:27:13,293
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm going to be doing my geography homework during lunch tomorrow.

285
00:27:14,834 --> 00:27:15,354
[SPEAKER_15]: Geography.

286
00:27:16,294 --> 00:27:17,995
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm so glad that class is good.

287
00:27:19,878 --> 00:27:21,419
[SPEAKER_05]: And I have jury duty on the 19th.

288
00:27:21,539 --> 00:27:24,281
[SPEAKER_15]: Billy, if you're taking geography, maybe you can answer a question for me.

289
00:27:24,822 --> 00:27:26,983
[SPEAKER_15]: Is Canada a state or not?

290
00:27:29,325 --> 00:27:30,266
[SPEAKER_05]: Canada is a country.

291
00:27:30,846 --> 00:27:30,966
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh.

292
00:27:31,267 --> 00:27:32,848
[SPEAKER_15]: Because a lot of people just say it's another state.

293
00:27:32,868 --> 00:27:33,789
[SPEAKER_05]: And it has territories.

294
00:27:34,449 --> 00:27:36,050
[SPEAKER_15]: I know, I'm just teasing.

295
00:27:36,351 --> 00:27:39,593
[SPEAKER_05]: Whoever thinks Canada is a state is a dipshit.

296
00:27:39,693 --> 00:27:44,457
[SPEAKER_15]: I just wanted to piss off Socorina and whatever Canadian listeners we have, so... No.

297
00:27:45,458 --> 00:27:46,618
[SPEAKER_05]: Didn't you just hear what I just said?

298
00:27:46,658 --> 00:27:48,420
[SPEAKER_05]: Whoever says that Canada is a state...

299
00:27:49,755 --> 00:27:51,376
[SPEAKER_05]: Whoever legitimately thinks that.

300
00:27:51,716 --> 00:27:53,437
[SPEAKER_15]: You know there's people out there that think that.

301
00:27:53,717 --> 00:27:54,557
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, they're dipshits.

302
00:27:55,798 --> 00:27:57,699
[SPEAKER_15]: And Canada's just one big state.

303
00:27:57,779 --> 00:28:04,122
[SPEAKER_05]: They need to be drug out into the street, and then someone needs to... And then the Queen of England is the governor of Canada.

304
00:28:05,963 --> 00:28:07,784
[SPEAKER_14]: It makes perfect sense that Canada's a state.

305
00:28:07,804 --> 00:28:10,665
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, that's how Alaska's attached to the rest of the United States.

306
00:28:11,586 --> 00:28:18,890
[SPEAKER_05]: But they need to be taken out into the middle of the street, and then someone needs to get, like, a big stinky sweat, you know, sweat sock, and then put a tennis ball in it and beat them in the head with it.

307
00:28:20,498 --> 00:28:21,018
[SPEAKER_05]: A wet one.

308
00:28:21,759 --> 00:28:23,661
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, fresh from the football player's foot.

309
00:28:26,303 --> 00:28:28,685
[SPEAKER_15]: It's just another state where they have, you know, healthcare.

310
00:28:29,806 --> 00:28:30,707
[SPEAKER_15]: Anyway, I'm teasing.

311
00:28:30,747 --> 00:28:31,707
[SPEAKER_15]: Of course I'm not that stupid.

312
00:28:31,767 --> 00:28:33,149
[SPEAKER_15]: And dirty French people.

313
00:28:35,330 --> 00:28:41,936
[SPEAKER_05]: I do have to say, having known quite a number of French Canadians during my time of living in Mobile...

314
00:28:44,215 --> 00:28:46,397
[SPEAKER_05]: And I try not to make generalizations about people.

315
00:28:47,678 --> 00:28:49,300
[SPEAKER_05]: I prefer the French to the French Canadians.

316
00:28:52,122 --> 00:28:53,984
[SPEAKER_09]: I think Sakurina's from Quebec.

317
00:28:55,025 --> 00:28:56,306
[SPEAKER_05]: I know several people from Quebec.

318
00:28:56,346 --> 00:28:57,367
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm saying in general.

319
00:28:59,289 --> 00:29:00,049
[SPEAKER_15]: You make them cry.

320
00:29:00,069 --> 00:29:02,291
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't make our listeners cry again.

321
00:29:02,331 --> 00:29:03,893
[SPEAKER_05]: I wasn't talking about you specifically.

322
00:29:03,913 --> 00:29:05,294
[SPEAKER_15]: Don't make the listeners cry again.

323
00:29:06,195 --> 00:29:07,576
[SPEAKER_15]: That's like the third time this month.

324
00:29:07,796 --> 00:29:08,737
[SPEAKER_15]: And we're only on the fourth.

325
00:29:09,618 --> 00:29:10,178
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what?

326
00:29:10,298 --> 00:29:10,499
[SPEAKER_15]: What?

327
00:29:13,542 --> 00:29:15,644
[SPEAKER_05]: Dude, okay, right cola is yummy.

328
00:29:17,206 --> 00:29:18,087
[SPEAKER_05]: We're talking about cola.

329
00:29:18,187 --> 00:29:19,048
[SPEAKER_15]: I know, I see they're talking.

330
00:29:19,269 --> 00:29:22,272
[SPEAKER_15]: Dude, did Canada invent Tab?

331
00:29:22,452 --> 00:29:26,176
[SPEAKER_15]: Because if they did, seriously, nuke them.

332
00:29:26,196 --> 00:29:27,217
[SPEAKER_05]: Tab is awful.

333
00:29:27,518 --> 00:29:33,164
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm actually, I was actually suggesting to my, well, I wanted to suggest to my husband that we move to Canada.

334
00:29:34,065 --> 00:29:34,706
[SPEAKER_15]: It's cold.

335
00:29:36,387 --> 00:29:37,948
[SPEAKER_15]: I like cold.

336
00:29:38,948 --> 00:29:41,028
[SPEAKER_05]: Bitch!

337
00:29:41,989 --> 00:29:47,930
[SPEAKER_05]: But there is, and I'm going to go ahead and say this now, there is the possibility of us moving in a year.

338
00:29:50,871 --> 00:29:53,812
[SPEAKER_05]: That does not mean I will no longer be doing the show.

339
00:29:54,852 --> 00:29:55,712
[SPEAKER_14]: I'll just convert all my money.

340
00:30:00,714 --> 00:30:01,575
[SPEAKER_05]: That's it, that's it.

341
00:30:01,675 --> 00:30:06,277
[SPEAKER_05]: Next Christmas, I'm going to convert all my money to Canadian dollars and then go shopping and then come back.

342
00:30:07,778 --> 00:30:12,461
[SPEAKER_15]: We probably have other Canadian listeners who are listening and going, these people are jerks.

343
00:30:13,201 --> 00:30:17,544
[SPEAKER_14]: It's alright, we had to make fun of this continent for once, you know, because it's always, you know.

344
00:30:18,264 --> 00:30:23,247
[SPEAKER_15]: You know what, you know what, I love Canada because I could get gay married there if I wanted to.

345
00:30:23,427 --> 00:30:28,850
[SPEAKER_05]: But honestly, if I move to any country, it's going to be to the UK.

346
00:30:28,870 --> 00:30:29,030
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

347
00:30:30,211 --> 00:30:34,275
[SPEAKER_05]: Because seriously, I'm so pissed off at our government.

348
00:30:36,137 --> 00:30:37,698
[SPEAKER_05]: I hate this situation here.

349
00:30:39,300 --> 00:30:42,323
[SPEAKER_05]: So hopefully, I'm going to say this publicly on the air.

350
00:30:42,463 --> 00:30:45,165
[SPEAKER_05]: If any, I want to be hired by zombie flesh eaters, please.

351
00:30:45,205 --> 00:30:45,526
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

352
00:30:47,708 --> 00:30:48,028
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.

353
00:30:48,528 --> 00:30:49,389
[SPEAKER_14]: Loki, how was your week?

354
00:30:49,409 --> 00:30:49,890
[SPEAKER_14]: How was your day?

355
00:30:50,936 --> 00:30:51,917
[SPEAKER_14]: My week was okay.

356
00:30:52,357 --> 00:30:56,559
[SPEAKER_14]: I kicked the crap out of the rest of my colleagues in Grand Theft Auto, per usual.

357
00:30:57,639 --> 00:31:02,982
[SPEAKER_14]: Now we're actually going to start keeping stats now, just because I want to know how badly I'm winning.

358
00:31:05,864 --> 00:31:09,286
[SPEAKER_14]: Other than that, I've been just waiting for my 360 to come in.

359
00:31:09,686 --> 00:31:13,188
[SPEAKER_14]: Talked to people at GameStop, and they haven't even gotten another shipment in.

360
00:31:13,368 --> 00:31:15,749
[SPEAKER_14]: So, yay Microsoft!

361
00:31:16,149 --> 00:31:26,617
[SPEAKER_14]: Meanwhile, Microsoft launched in Europe with less than expected 360s because, you know, those should have come over here instead of sending them to the UK.

362
00:31:27,278 --> 00:31:27,918
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, we got ours.

363
00:31:28,559 --> 00:31:29,359
[SPEAKER_05]: It freezes all the time.

364
00:31:31,621 --> 00:31:40,488
[SPEAKER_14]: Anyways, then I was also waiting for my accessories to show up at my work, and those still haven't come in either because Microsoft, once again, is slow on sending something out.

365
00:31:40,928 --> 00:31:42,929
[SPEAKER_14]: I swear to God, they just, like, screw everything up.

366
00:31:43,190 --> 00:31:44,791
[SPEAKER_14]: They really don't know what they're doing.

367
00:31:46,621 --> 00:31:58,964
[SPEAKER_14]: because you know it makes perfect sense let's go ahead we're really short on units in the United States let's go ahead and launch in another country so that they're also disappointed in our launch as well that'd make perfect sense

368
00:32:01,468 --> 00:32:06,789
[SPEAKER_14]: and then what next week they're going to do Japan and then Japanese just won't give a shit because none of them are buying it.

369
00:32:08,049 --> 00:32:11,730
[SPEAKER_15]: Actually, I hear more people give a shit about Xbox 360 than like the Revolution.

370
00:32:11,810 --> 00:32:12,810
[SPEAKER_15]: I was reading some article.

371
00:32:12,830 --> 00:32:14,751
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, because there's no info about the Revolution.

372
00:32:14,871 --> 00:32:16,291
[SPEAKER_14]: The 360 is coming out.

373
00:32:16,611 --> 00:32:18,211
[SPEAKER_14]: So, I don't know.

374
00:32:19,412 --> 00:32:31,214
[SPEAKER_15]: And then... FYI, boys and girls, we did just have a big ass net split in our chat room so folks are dropping like flies but, you know, life goes on so just keep trying.

375
00:32:32,381 --> 00:32:35,685
[SPEAKER_14]: Other than that, that's pretty much the main part of the week.

376
00:32:35,725 --> 00:32:40,990
[SPEAKER_14]: I didn't really do anything of importance other than kick crap out of my colleagues in Grand Theft Auto.

377
00:32:42,491 --> 00:32:43,292
[SPEAKER_14]: Because I rock.

378
00:32:45,595 --> 00:32:46,355
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, that's about it.

379
00:32:48,598 --> 00:32:49,799
[SPEAKER_15]: Alright, super.

380
00:32:50,460 --> 00:32:50,840
[SPEAKER_15]: Angel!

381
00:32:51,701 --> 00:32:52,602
[SPEAKER_15]: Angel, Angel, Angel.

382
00:32:52,682 --> 00:32:53,122
[SPEAKER_15]: How was your week?

383
00:32:53,142 --> 00:32:53,603
[SPEAKER_15]: How was your day?

384
00:32:54,912 --> 00:32:55,372
[SPEAKER_04]: Good.

385
00:32:56,173 --> 00:32:56,734
[SPEAKER_04]: School.

386
00:32:57,194 --> 00:32:57,675
[SPEAKER_04]: Grr.

387
00:32:58,395 --> 00:32:59,236
[SPEAKER_04]: Finals next week.

388
00:32:59,476 --> 00:32:59,837
[SPEAKER_04]: Good.

389
00:33:00,117 --> 00:33:00,357
[SPEAKER_04]: Why?

390
00:33:00,437 --> 00:33:01,058
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I get to go.

391
00:33:01,698 --> 00:33:01,919
[SPEAKER_04]: Wait.

392
00:33:02,239 --> 00:33:02,519
[SPEAKER_04]: No more.

393
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:03,640
[SPEAKER_04]: Well.

394
00:33:05,782 --> 00:33:06,363
[SPEAKER_04]: Two weeks.

395
00:33:07,143 --> 00:33:08,365
[SPEAKER_04]: And then school's over.

396
00:33:08,545 --> 00:33:11,568
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I get to go back to my parents' house for like ten days.

397
00:33:12,228 --> 00:33:12,668
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

398
00:33:38,567 --> 00:33:40,388
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, yeah.

399
00:33:40,648 --> 00:33:41,849
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah, World of Warcraft.

400
00:33:42,249 --> 00:33:43,490
[SPEAKER_04]: And we're all on the same server now.

401
00:33:43,510 --> 00:33:44,531
[SPEAKER_04]: That's pretty funny, isn't it?

402
00:33:45,231 --> 00:33:46,412
[SPEAKER_05]: I refuse to play on that server.

403
00:33:47,052 --> 00:33:47,413
[SPEAKER_05]: Why?

404
00:33:48,954 --> 00:33:50,995
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I'm already playing on two other servers.

405
00:33:52,626 --> 00:33:53,627
[SPEAKER_05]: People are welcome to play with me.

406
00:33:53,647 --> 00:33:54,327
[SPEAKER_15]: It doesn't matter.

407
00:33:54,907 --> 00:33:56,788
[SPEAKER_15]: I barely play World of Warcraft anymore.

408
00:33:56,848 --> 00:33:57,468
[SPEAKER_15]: It's kind of sad.

409
00:33:57,849 --> 00:33:59,589
[SPEAKER_15]: I do, however, play Dragon Quest.

410
00:33:59,869 --> 00:34:01,590
[SPEAKER_15]: I haven't played a lot of games at all this week, though.

411
00:34:01,750 --> 00:34:02,651
[SPEAKER_15]: Really, it's kind of sad.

412
00:34:02,691 --> 00:34:05,972
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I've just kind of done World of Warcraft when I can.

413
00:34:06,192 --> 00:34:16,897
[SPEAKER_04]: Most of the week's been dedicated to school, so... Yeah, and then my birthday, so... Nothing really happened this week, per se.

414
00:34:17,098 --> 00:34:19,979
[SPEAKER_04]: Just World of Warcraft when I could, and then homework...

415
00:34:20,720 --> 00:34:31,527
[SPEAKER_04]: and then sleep and then school and you know the regular usual grind so I've had a very boring week aside from today so it's all good

416
00:34:35,766 --> 00:34:36,547
[SPEAKER_15]: My week and my day.

417
00:34:37,847 --> 00:34:38,288
[SPEAKER_15]: Pretty good.

418
00:34:38,508 --> 00:34:39,288
[SPEAKER_15]: I had a pretty good week.

419
00:34:39,689 --> 00:34:42,951
[SPEAKER_15]: Just really busy, work stuff and all that good things.

420
00:34:43,191 --> 00:34:44,772
[SPEAKER_15]: I really wasn't getting a lot of sleep this week.

421
00:34:44,832 --> 00:34:48,155
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh yeah, this was my week where it was like energy drinks kept me through this week.

422
00:34:48,515 --> 00:34:51,177
[SPEAKER_15]: And I never drink those energy drinks because they're horrible for you.

423
00:34:51,197 --> 00:34:54,799
[SPEAKER_15]: Like, Extifer, who's not here tonight because he's on the road right now.

424
00:34:55,159 --> 00:35:01,524
[SPEAKER_15]: Extifer was telling me about how those energy drinks sent his brother to the hospital for

425
00:35:01,764 --> 00:35:05,428
[SPEAKER_15]: because his brother drank too many of those things, like the Buku and the Rockstar and all that shit.

426
00:35:06,469 --> 00:35:08,030
[SPEAKER_15]: You've got to be careful with that stuff.

427
00:35:08,130 --> 00:35:12,074
[SPEAKER_15]: Use them once in a while if you absolutely need to, but otherwise, that stuff will kill you.

428
00:35:12,134 --> 00:35:14,776
[SPEAKER_15]: Why are your eyes lighting up like it's a new Christmas toy, Loki?

429
00:35:15,117 --> 00:35:18,019
[SPEAKER_15]: Your eyes are lighting up like, oh my gosh, I'm so excited, I'm going to go drink a bunch.

430
00:35:19,020 --> 00:35:19,361
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.

431
00:35:20,181 --> 00:35:21,523
[SPEAKER_14]: Because you want to go to the hospital?

432
00:35:21,643 --> 00:35:24,886
[SPEAKER_14]: No, I don't like the hospital, but I think I can handle it.

433
00:35:25,829 --> 00:35:26,991
[SPEAKER_15]: I'll drink that with alcohol.

434
00:35:27,011 --> 00:35:27,672
[SPEAKER_15]: That would be perfect.

435
00:35:27,752 --> 00:35:28,453
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, that's okay.

436
00:35:28,553 --> 00:35:31,096
[SPEAKER_15]: Like Red Bull and vodka, because you don't really drink that much of it.

437
00:35:31,136 --> 00:35:32,879
[SPEAKER_15]: But like, okay, this is seriously bad, okay?

438
00:35:33,359 --> 00:35:34,981
[SPEAKER_15]: Wednesday, I had a Rockstar.

439
00:35:35,382 --> 00:35:36,744
[SPEAKER_15]: Thursday, I had a Rockstar.

440
00:35:37,184 --> 00:35:38,346
[SPEAKER_15]: Friday, I had a Rockstar.

441
00:35:38,766 --> 00:35:39,727
[SPEAKER_15]: Not good.

442
00:35:39,928 --> 00:35:41,750
[SPEAKER_15]: I should not be drinking that much energy drinks.

443
00:35:41,910 --> 00:35:43,753
[SPEAKER_14]: You're sounding like Pam Anderson.

444
00:35:48,541 --> 00:36:02,911
[SPEAKER_15]: Good job, you're funny, you're a funny man And even though I'm drinking diet, I don't get what Can somebody explain to me how diet Rockstar is different from Rockstar?

445
00:36:03,071 --> 00:36:10,176
[SPEAKER_05]: Like carbs and sugar, but otherwise it's still bad for you Oh, it's just probably made with Splendor or whatever the fuck, I don't know

446
00:36:10,664 --> 00:36:16,206
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't taste the difference, but... I think that they're all nasty, especially Red Bull, which looks and tastes like piss.

447
00:36:16,407 --> 00:36:22,709
[SPEAKER_15]: So, actually, Red Bull, to me... Now, not that I really know what this tastes like, but actually a lesbian told me this, is that Red Bull tastes like pussy.

448
00:36:24,070 --> 00:36:24,930
[SPEAKER_15]: But it looks like pee.

449
00:36:25,510 --> 00:36:30,633
[SPEAKER_15]: Obviously, I don't know this to be true, because I've never really eaten pussy, because, you know, I am a homosexual.

450
00:36:32,213 --> 00:36:38,256
[SPEAKER_15]: However... Well, I did date girls in college and stuff, but, you know, I never, you know, did that.

451
00:36:39,176 --> 00:36:39,436
[SPEAKER_15]: Uh-huh

452
00:37:06,969 --> 00:37:09,551
[SPEAKER_15]: Anyway, I don't remember where I was going with that, I know.

453
00:37:11,032 --> 00:37:12,314
[SPEAKER_15]: Train derailed, show derailed.

454
00:37:13,354 --> 00:37:15,316
[SPEAKER_15]: Let's see, back on topic, back on topic.

455
00:37:15,736 --> 00:37:27,927
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, let's see, I saw a friend of mine this weekend, a couple of friends of mine this weekend who I hadn't seen in a while, so that was cool, and I saw some Karaoke Revolution Partey.

456
00:37:28,567 --> 00:37:55,881
[SPEAKER_15]: which was fun and um but karaoke revolution party is kind of overdone for me now I think I think I've seen too much of it like if I hear another fucking person saying I will always love you I'm going to force them to drink a gallon of Red Bull or something because I can't stand to hear people sing those songs anymore um however all in all good times and um

457
00:37:58,419 --> 00:38:00,180
[SPEAKER_15]: I ate a lot of food this weekend.

458
00:38:01,841 --> 00:38:02,602
[SPEAKER_15]: That's about it.

459
00:38:05,023 --> 00:38:05,964
[SPEAKER_15]: I've been in a mood.

460
00:38:06,584 --> 00:38:09,366
[SPEAKER_15]: Actually, I have to say, I'm going to be absolutely honest.

461
00:38:09,446 --> 00:38:11,628
[SPEAKER_15]: I've had male PMS all week long.

462
00:38:12,108 --> 00:38:12,808
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't know what it is.

463
00:38:13,669 --> 00:38:24,416
[SPEAKER_15]: I suspect, and I probably shouldn't be laughing about this or bringing this up on the show, but I suspect that I'm one of those people that probably gets really affected by the weather, the seasonal disorder, whatever, because seriously...

464
00:38:25,251 --> 00:38:28,954
[SPEAKER_15]: I always get male PMS in December when the seasons start changing around here.

465
00:38:29,114 --> 00:38:29,935
[SPEAKER_15]: Like, always.

466
00:38:31,436 --> 00:38:34,619
[SPEAKER_15]: And so this week I've been kind of PMS-y and I haven't wanted to do a whole lot except nap.

467
00:38:35,199 --> 00:38:37,041
[SPEAKER_15]: So, that's the reality.

468
00:38:38,362 --> 00:38:40,443
[SPEAKER_15]: That's not me making shit up for radio.

469
00:38:40,484 --> 00:38:44,387
[SPEAKER_15]: That's the reality is that I really haven't done a lot this week because I've been sad.

470
00:38:48,667 --> 00:38:52,590
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, I forgot to mention, I bought another game for the Xbox 360.

471
00:38:52,990 --> 00:38:55,452
[SPEAKER_14]: It makes a total of five now.

472
00:38:56,273 --> 00:38:57,934
[SPEAKER_14]: Five games for a system I don't own.

473
00:38:58,014 --> 00:38:58,234
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

474
00:39:00,516 --> 00:39:01,597
[SPEAKER_14]: I just find that to be ridiculous.

475
00:39:01,617 --> 00:39:03,058
[SPEAKER_15]: When are you getting your Xbox 360?

476
00:39:03,098 --> 00:39:03,919
[SPEAKER_15]: Have you figured it out yet?

477
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:10,724
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm thinking sometime before the apocalypse, perhaps.

478
00:39:11,725 --> 00:39:14,567
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, they were telling me, they said by Christmas.

479
00:39:15,151 --> 00:39:16,752
[SPEAKER_14]: and they said I was halfway down the list.

480
00:39:16,913 --> 00:39:20,816
[SPEAKER_14]: However, I actually got to see the list and I'm not quite halfway down the list.

481
00:39:20,896 --> 00:39:24,258
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm more of, oh, I don't know, five names from the bottom of the list.

482
00:39:24,899 --> 00:39:26,921
[SPEAKER_14]: It's like, oh, thank you very much.

483
00:39:28,382 --> 00:39:30,964
[SPEAKER_15]: Have there been more shipments of Xbox 360 since the first?

484
00:39:31,985 --> 00:39:33,506
[SPEAKER_14]: Not to GameStop, at least.

485
00:39:34,066 --> 00:39:35,227
[SPEAKER_15]: We got ours.

486
00:39:36,468 --> 00:39:37,709
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, I mean, like, in general.

487
00:39:37,729 --> 00:39:40,372
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, yeah, but you have someone that works for GameStop.

488
00:39:40,432 --> 00:39:42,013
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm talking about average Joes here.

489
00:39:43,373 --> 00:39:54,581
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, hell, let's talk about my boss, who, you know, one of our co-workers, you know, their boyfriend works for GameStop, and he ordered his after mine, and he got it on lunch day.

490
00:39:54,661 --> 00:39:55,842
[SPEAKER_14]: Gee, I wonder how that works.

491
00:39:56,042 --> 00:39:56,763
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, you didn't do that.

492
00:39:58,464 --> 00:39:59,825
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, I know you didn't do that.

493
00:40:00,826 --> 00:40:01,866
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm not talking about you.

494
00:40:02,327 --> 00:40:03,668
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm just saying that, you know...

495
00:40:05,737 --> 00:40:06,757
[SPEAKER_14]: It's impossible to get one.

496
00:40:06,997 --> 00:40:12,178
[SPEAKER_14]: But anyways, no, they haven't really gotten one, at least not at the GameStop that's by my house.

497
00:40:12,658 --> 00:40:17,899
[SPEAKER_14]: And I asked them if they had any more shipments since launch, and they said they hadn't gotten anything.

498
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:21,300
[SPEAKER_14]: Maybe next week, maybe whatever.

499
00:40:21,360 --> 00:40:22,800
[SPEAKER_14]: But I don't know, it's taking so long.

500
00:40:23,301 --> 00:40:27,101
[SPEAKER_14]: And they're only making it worse for themselves now that they're launched in two different countries.

501
00:40:27,201 --> 00:40:29,622
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, if they didn't have enough units before...

502
00:40:30,842 --> 00:40:30,982
[SPEAKER_14]: Dork

503
00:40:45,836 --> 00:40:46,696
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, I'm just tired.

504
00:40:46,996 --> 00:40:56,578
[SPEAKER_14]: The whole thing is I'm just... I have these games, and I've been waiting, you know, it'll be, you know, a couple weeks now for this thing, and I'm just kind of tired of waiting.

505
00:40:56,678 --> 00:40:59,379
[SPEAKER_15]: At $60 a game, that's about $300 in games you have right now.

506
00:40:59,399 --> 00:40:59,939
[SPEAKER_14]: It's all credit.

507
00:41:00,539 --> 00:41:01,300
[SPEAKER_14]: All store credit.

508
00:41:01,420 --> 00:41:04,340
[SPEAKER_14]: I paid not one cent for any of those games.

509
00:41:06,641 --> 00:41:07,081
[SPEAKER_02]: Amazing.

510
00:41:07,501 --> 00:41:08,441
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.

511
00:41:08,561 --> 00:41:10,262
[SPEAKER_14]: So, I'm not worried about that.

512
00:41:10,742 --> 00:41:11,822
[SPEAKER_14]: But the thing is, it's just...

513
00:41:13,024 --> 00:41:40,576
[SPEAKER_14]: I really kind of want the system now since I paid for it and you know waiting at you know GameStop it's going to take me forever even if they do get their shipment in I'm not going to be on that shipment so I've got to wait and I'll be waiting till next year by that time hell my work will have them then it's just retarded so I might as well just go ahead and you know pick one up at GameStop or Best Buy or whatever and then just you know cancel my pre-order there and get my money back

514
00:41:41,713 --> 00:41:45,274
[SPEAKER_15]: I think we should go and kick Microsoft in the balls for what they're doing with this.

515
00:41:45,754 --> 00:41:47,394
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, seriously, this is stupid.

516
00:41:47,734 --> 00:41:50,055
[SPEAKER_14]: And then they keep advertising their system and stuff.

517
00:41:50,155 --> 00:41:52,315
[SPEAKER_14]: They're not in fucking stores, you morons.

518
00:41:52,775 --> 00:41:56,616
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, I haven't seen any Xbox 360 in stores now.

519
00:41:56,696 --> 00:41:57,136
[SPEAKER_15]: No, they're not.

520
00:41:58,717 --> 00:42:02,497
[SPEAKER_14]: It's not around, and their whole marketing is retarded.

521
00:42:03,498 --> 00:42:04,598
[SPEAKER_14]: They really need to just...

522
00:42:05,469 --> 00:42:05,769
[SPEAKER_14]: Stop.

523
00:42:05,889 --> 00:42:08,610
[SPEAKER_14]: They should have, this whole worldwide launch is the most retarded thing.

524
00:42:09,070 --> 00:42:13,670
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, first off, they can't really say, oh yeah, we did a worldwide launch.

525
00:42:13,770 --> 00:42:14,311
[SPEAKER_14]: No, you didn't.

526
00:42:14,691 --> 00:42:15,571
[SPEAKER_14]: You failed at that.

527
00:42:15,711 --> 00:42:20,512
[SPEAKER_14]: So, you can't even, you know, hold that above everyone else's heads.

528
00:42:21,272 --> 00:42:26,973
[SPEAKER_14]: They should have just launched in one country at first, a couple months later launch in another country, and later another country.

529
00:42:27,393 --> 00:42:28,333
[SPEAKER_14]: Poor Australia.

530
00:42:28,353 --> 00:42:33,134
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, that's kind of giving you an idea of when units are actually going to be in stores.

531
00:42:33,234 --> 00:42:33,534
[SPEAKER_14]: March?

532
00:42:35,447 --> 00:42:40,453
[SPEAKER_14]: They better hope that Sony isn't like, oh yeah, we're going to be able to launch in a couple months with our PS3.

533
00:42:40,473 --> 00:42:44,198
[SPEAKER_14]: It's just ridiculous.

534
00:42:47,402 --> 00:42:47,983
[SPEAKER_14]: That's all I got.

535
00:42:52,935 --> 00:42:53,535
[SPEAKER_15]: Earth to Rob.

536
00:42:53,936 --> 00:42:54,176
[SPEAKER_15]: Sorry.

537
00:42:54,456 --> 00:43:08,123
[SPEAKER_15]: We're going to have a break, and when we come back from a break, we're going to open up the Skype line, and your comments, because it's not broken this week, and we'll have that.

538
00:43:09,423 --> 00:43:16,187
[SPEAKER_15]: So we'll be back after this mix of music from various Bomani games.

539
00:43:17,506 --> 00:43:24,556
[SPEAKER_15]: We'll be back with more Orange Lounge Radio and other news and some movie time, hopefully.

540
00:44:57,154 --> 00:45:11,817
[SPEAKER_08]: See together, see together See together, see together See together, see together See together, see together Yacht in the moonlight, you dance in the shadow Rain drops the dream of a dream The night is the moment of salvation, shall things ever run?

541
00:45:32,632 --> 00:45:34,133
Thank you for watching!

542
00:46:14,105 --> 00:46:14,766
Thanks for watching!

543
00:48:01,339 --> 00:48:03,382
[SPEAKER_08]: From the front, FZ-24, a rescue team is approaching!

544
00:49:45,836 --> 00:49:54,382
[SPEAKER_16]: Hiho, Kermit the Frog here, informing you that today's broadcast of Orange Lounge Radio is brought to you by the letter V, the letter A, and the number 59.

545
00:49:54,422 --> 00:49:59,906
[SPEAKER_08]: Can you tell me how to get, how to get to Sesame Street?

546
00:50:00,207 --> 00:50:13,356
[SPEAKER_15]: We're back here on Orange Lounge Radio, and before the break we were talking a little bit about our weeks and our days, and now of course we need to get into talking a little bit about what's going on with those music games we know, and love, and adore.

547
00:50:13,917 --> 00:50:14,257
[SPEAKER_15]: And, um,

548
00:50:14,497 --> 00:50:18,361
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm hearing that there's some pretty big news going on with Beatmania US.

549
00:50:18,802 --> 00:50:20,884
[SPEAKER_15]: A buddy of mine in chat told me about this.

550
00:50:20,904 --> 00:50:23,467
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm going to see if I can get him to call in in a little bit.

551
00:50:24,929 --> 00:50:26,651
[SPEAKER_15]: But I guess some big stuff going on.

552
00:50:26,691 --> 00:50:28,813
[SPEAKER_15]: I heard that the game festival was this weekend, right?

553
00:50:28,833 --> 00:50:32,697
[SPEAKER_15]: That was the big festival that went on in San Francisco where they had a bunch of games that were being shown.

554
00:50:33,458 --> 00:50:34,099
[SPEAKER_15]: It was kind of like...

555
00:50:35,700 --> 00:51:02,872
[SPEAKER_15]: E3 but the X Games or something so I don't know how to explain it what they were doing but apparently Beatmania didn't show up the first day because of a really stupid mistake not on Konami's end but on some festival planning end so they didn't have Beatmania USA the first day but I think it did finally make an appearance this weekend so we probably know a little bit more about it so I'm going to see if we can get somebody who might have been there to tell us a little more about it first hand however

556
00:51:04,192 --> 00:51:07,575
[SPEAKER_15]: We do have news about what's going on with Beatmania over in Japan.

557
00:51:07,715 --> 00:51:13,079
[SPEAKER_15]: Beatmania 2DX 13th style, also known as Beatmania 2DX Distorted.

558
00:51:14,880 --> 00:51:21,985
[SPEAKER_15]: Because I think they are going back to saying 2DX 13, but they're still not saying 13th style or anything.

559
00:51:22,045 --> 00:51:24,567
[SPEAKER_15]: So whatever you want to call it, Distorted I guess would be the official name.

560
00:51:26,028 --> 00:51:28,430
[SPEAKER_15]: They're actually location testing right now.

561
00:51:29,231 --> 00:51:31,433
[SPEAKER_15]: Some folks snuck in a camera.

562
00:51:31,453 --> 00:51:34,155
[SPEAKER_15]: This is like a high security place.

563
00:51:34,435 --> 00:51:36,577
[SPEAKER_15]: These kids could probably get arrested for what they're doing.

564
00:51:36,717 --> 00:51:43,883
[SPEAKER_15]: To bring joy to us all, they snuck a camera in there and recorded some of what was going on on the location test and some of the songs.

565
00:51:44,103 --> 00:51:49,948
[SPEAKER_15]: I haven't seen this, but I hear that there's a pretty awesome video for a new song called Starfield.

566
00:51:51,609 --> 00:51:55,231
[SPEAKER_15]: Sunfield, which, you know, obviously the name sounds an awful lot like Starfield.

567
00:51:56,051 --> 00:52:00,694
[SPEAKER_15]: But there's a pretty awesome video, and one of our chatters, Siggy, suggested that we watch it.

568
00:52:01,254 --> 00:52:02,815
[SPEAKER_15]: So I said, sure, why not?

569
00:52:02,975 --> 00:52:03,455
[SPEAKER_15]: Let's watch it.

570
00:52:03,995 --> 00:52:04,896
[SPEAKER_15]: So here it is.

571
00:52:04,936 --> 00:52:06,756
[SPEAKER_15]: We're going to do a little bit of Orange Lounge Movie Time.

572
00:52:06,816 --> 00:52:09,018
[SPEAKER_15]: This is the location test for Sunfield.

573
00:52:09,318 --> 00:52:11,879
[SPEAKER_15]: And you guys might be able to hear a little bit of the song in the background here.

574
00:52:11,899 --> 00:52:16,001
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, go with it.

575
00:52:16,021 --> 00:52:18,162
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, the interface is kind of easy, though.

576
00:52:20,256 --> 00:52:23,257
[SPEAKER_15]: The only one I saw was the Akira Yamaoka IP2 list video.

577
00:52:23,277 --> 00:52:24,818
[SPEAKER_15]: This looks a lot better quality.

578
00:52:24,918 --> 00:52:25,558
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, look at that!

579
00:52:25,578 --> 00:52:27,899
[SPEAKER_15]: Little nice feed reader there on the side.

580
00:52:27,919 --> 00:52:28,479
[SPEAKER_13]: That's nice.

581
00:52:29,020 --> 00:52:31,261
[SPEAKER_13]: I think that was carried over from another style though.

582
00:52:31,281 --> 00:52:34,682
[SPEAKER_13]: This definitely sounds nothing like Starfield.

583
00:52:50,729 --> 00:52:57,131
[SPEAKER_13]: It's the BABY TRANNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNN

584
00:53:20,117 --> 00:53:21,157
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, hey, Tran's all grown up now.

585
00:53:21,177 --> 00:53:22,158
[SPEAKER_13]: There's Tran, she's got the ball.

586
00:53:22,198 --> 00:53:23,998
[SPEAKER_13]: And now Tran is flying on a colored something.

587
00:53:24,118 --> 00:53:25,058
It's a walker!

588
00:53:25,339 --> 00:53:26,099
[SPEAKER_13]: It's a walker!

589
00:53:26,179 --> 00:53:26,359
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, cute.

590
00:53:39,088 --> 00:53:40,908
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, is that like Mommy Tran and Baby Tran?

591
00:53:40,968 --> 00:53:41,369
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, I get it.

592
00:53:41,409 --> 00:53:42,489
[SPEAKER_13]: Here, play with your head.

593
00:53:42,569 --> 00:53:44,429
[SPEAKER_13]: Time to change the diaper, Baby Tran.

594
00:53:44,469 --> 00:53:47,770
[SPEAKER_08]: Now back to the words I can't read because they're a bit of an angle.

595
00:53:47,790 --> 00:53:48,690
[SPEAKER_13]: Driving into a smile.

596
00:53:48,730 --> 00:53:48,990
[SPEAKER_13]: Ingrid!

597
00:54:06,064 --> 00:54:07,365
[SPEAKER_13]: And that's what the lyrics are telling us.

598
00:54:07,445 --> 00:54:09,447
[SPEAKER_13]: Happiness time, I think, driving us through the smile.

599
00:54:09,487 --> 00:54:11,429
[SPEAKER_13]: I think that's all the buzzers say.

600
00:54:11,449 --> 00:54:14,212
[SPEAKER_13]: Look at that, you can almost see the reflection of the guy.

601
00:54:14,252 --> 00:54:15,573
We're gonna go have him arrested.

602
00:54:29,590 --> 00:54:40,479
[SPEAKER_15]: The video to iFutureList, which is over on that computer somewhere, it's pretty cool because you can actually see Akira Yamaoka really well in the video.

603
00:54:41,540 --> 00:54:43,001
[SPEAKER_15]: Let me describe the video like this.

604
00:54:43,842 --> 00:54:44,482
[SPEAKER_15]: One word.

605
00:54:45,223 --> 00:54:45,864
[SPEAKER_15]: Shades.

606
00:54:47,725 --> 00:54:51,388
[SPEAKER_15]: I swear to God, that was a part of the video that stuck out in my mind.

607
00:54:51,428 --> 00:54:51,889
[SPEAKER_15]: It was great.

608
00:54:53,170 --> 00:54:53,390
[SPEAKER_15]: Anyway.

609
00:54:55,359 --> 00:54:56,320
[SPEAKER_15]: Check that out, boys and girls.

610
00:54:57,361 --> 00:55:04,068
[SPEAKER_15]: Those location test videos are posted over on Bomani Style.

611
00:55:04,308 --> 00:55:05,469
[SPEAKER_15]: So you can go check that out if you want.

612
00:55:05,990 --> 00:55:08,413
[SPEAKER_15]: We post them on our website, but that's not really our thing.

613
00:55:08,633 --> 00:55:10,955
[SPEAKER_15]: We don't want to tread on somebody else's territory.

614
00:55:11,095 --> 00:55:16,561
[SPEAKER_15]: And the pirating of 2DX videos has always been Bomani Style's forte.

615
00:55:16,641 --> 00:55:17,502
[SPEAKER_15]: So have at it.

616
00:55:20,808 --> 00:55:22,810
[SPEAKER_15]: Alright, we're going to open up the Skype line, boys and girls.

617
00:55:22,870 --> 00:55:26,673
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm sure you kids want to call us and let us know what's going on.

618
00:55:27,353 --> 00:55:28,354
[SPEAKER_15]: So the Skype line's open.

619
00:55:28,855 --> 00:55:29,375
[SPEAKER_15]: Give us a call.

620
00:55:30,856 --> 00:55:31,997
[SPEAKER_15]: Hello, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

621
00:55:34,759 --> 00:55:35,140
[SPEAKER_15]: Hello?

622
00:55:35,380 --> 00:55:36,701
[SPEAKER_15]: Hello, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

623
00:55:38,022 --> 00:55:39,203
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, hello there.

624
00:55:41,024 --> 00:55:42,165
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, I think I can get you now.

625
00:55:42,626 --> 00:55:43,146
[SPEAKER_15]: Can you hear us?

626
00:55:44,307 --> 00:55:45,168
[SPEAKER_15]: Yep, I can hear you.

627
00:55:45,428 --> 00:55:46,509
[SPEAKER_15]: And who might this be?

628
00:55:48,109 --> 00:55:50,391
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, you're speaking two to one and only Mel to the Bizzle.

629
00:55:50,951 --> 00:55:52,572
[SPEAKER_15]: Hello, Mel to the Bizzle.

630
00:55:52,672 --> 00:55:54,454
[SPEAKER_15]: How are you, Mel Bizzle, Mr. Bizzle?

631
00:55:56,215 --> 00:56:04,681
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, yes, okay, you're just a little, you're a little bit intermittent in it out there, but... That's, that's, uh, that's because Loki is downloading porn on the other computer.

632
00:56:04,701 --> 00:56:06,122
[SPEAKER_15]: I am not doing any of that.

633
00:56:06,142 --> 00:56:10,125
[SPEAKER_15]: He's downloading lots and lots of pornography and it's messing up our bandwidth.

634
00:56:10,145 --> 00:56:11,146
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, I like Christopher's computer.

635
00:56:11,366 --> 00:56:16,610
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, it was... Yeah, I'm not surprised that Splooge is, uh, getting through the tubes of, uh, connection right now.

636
00:56:17,711 --> 00:56:18,731
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, what's going on?

637
00:56:19,071 --> 00:56:20,252
[SPEAKER_15]: How was the game festival?

638
00:56:20,312 --> 00:56:21,772
[SPEAKER_15]: You went to the game festival, right?

639
00:56:21,812 --> 00:56:22,252
[SPEAKER_15]: How was it?

640
00:56:23,452 --> 00:56:30,934
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it was pretty cool, you know, gaming music experience, but I think, and I know you can definitely feel where I'm coming from when I say this.

641
00:56:31,374 --> 00:56:35,315
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've been to E3, it's kind of like going to Vegas, you know, like of video gaming.

642
00:56:35,755 --> 00:56:39,136
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything's out there, it's so grandiose, you know, it's the whole nine.

643
00:56:39,716 --> 00:56:42,997
[SPEAKER_00]: When you go to a game, it's kind of like taking a side trip to Reno.

644
00:56:43,297 --> 00:56:43,597
Yeah!

645
00:56:44,451 --> 00:56:45,572
[SPEAKER_15]: It's like going to Reno.

646
00:56:45,912 --> 00:56:48,235
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, I definitely hear that.

647
00:56:49,175 --> 00:56:54,540
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, did you see any cool new things there at the Game and Music Experience or whatever the hell it was called?

648
00:56:54,560 --> 00:56:57,283
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a couple, yeah, the Game and Music Experience.

649
00:56:57,303 --> 00:56:58,324
[SPEAKER_00]: There were a couple new things.

650
00:56:58,364 --> 00:57:05,671
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I know most of the Orange Zones radio people want to hear about 2DX and I think you kind of got the scoop that 2DX wasn't there until like today.

651
00:57:05,871 --> 00:57:06,732
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, I heard about that.

652
00:57:07,438 --> 00:57:15,165
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, what happened with the scoop was, I don't know if you heard the full story, but essentially, first off, Friday, they didn't even put the freaking ROM in the display case.

653
00:57:15,265 --> 00:57:17,447
[SPEAKER_00]: Granted, remember, this is games doing this.

654
00:57:17,487 --> 00:57:20,049
[SPEAKER_00]: Konami and, like, all the other companies, they're not running their own boots.

655
00:57:20,109 --> 00:57:23,973
[SPEAKER_00]: This is, like, all done by union members and, you know, like they really know about video games.

656
00:57:24,093 --> 00:57:27,976
[SPEAKER_15]: So putting a lot of trust in people and then them fucking it up, basically.

657
00:57:29,297 --> 00:57:33,441
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so, okay, so, anyway, Jason, you know, he wasn't even going to be there this weekend, Jason, you know?

658
00:57:33,888 --> 00:57:36,510
[SPEAKER_00]: So he comes down and he finds out, you know, what the F is going on.

659
00:57:36,850 --> 00:57:41,314
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we talk to the, you know, coordinator, and then they say, yeah, we can't find a ROM.

660
00:57:41,334 --> 00:57:42,775
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's like, okay, great.

661
00:57:42,895 --> 00:57:47,739
[SPEAKER_00]: Not only is our game not being displayed, but now, you know, there's a loose ROM, and this could be some serious trouble.

662
00:57:48,039 --> 00:57:56,625
[SPEAKER_00]: So he has to run back down to Konami, get the ROM, and get, like, a debug PS2, and, you know, bring that back up, like, Friday, like, at midnight or so.

663
00:57:56,745 --> 00:57:59,808
[SPEAKER_00]: So, like, Saturday, you know, we figure we're going to have everything up and running.

664
00:58:00,088 --> 00:58:02,650
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the geniuses that ran the, you know, the whole place

665
00:58:03,230 --> 00:58:08,353
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, put into ROM this time, but they used their own PS2 and not the one that Jason brought.

666
00:58:08,673 --> 00:58:11,274
[SPEAKER_00]: So what happened was you could play the game all the way up to select a song.

667
00:58:11,294 --> 00:58:13,315
[SPEAKER_00]: When you select a song, the thing froze.

668
00:58:13,715 --> 00:58:16,797
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when the thing froze, people thought, oh great, this is, you know, a bugged ROM.

669
00:58:16,857 --> 00:58:18,478
[SPEAKER_00]: This is going to be the best game ever.

670
00:58:18,958 --> 00:58:22,400
[SPEAKER_15]: This is going to be the best game ever is what they were thinking.

671
00:58:24,096 --> 00:58:25,717
[SPEAKER_00]: Tell us, tell us, tell us!

672
00:58:25,737 --> 00:58:26,018
[SPEAKER_00]: Tell us what?

673
00:58:26,038 --> 00:58:26,618
[SPEAKER_00]: Tell us, tell us!

674
00:58:26,638 --> 00:58:28,320
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't hold back anymore, tell us, what's going on?

675
00:58:54,480 --> 00:58:58,363
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so, alright, so 2DX, you know, I got to check that out.

676
00:58:58,903 --> 00:59:02,445
[SPEAKER_00]: The build looked a lot like, you know, 9th South, pretty much like what you see.

677
00:59:02,465 --> 00:59:03,826
[SPEAKER_00]: It looked a little cleaner this time.

678
00:59:04,167 --> 00:59:11,311
[SPEAKER_00]: As far as song lists, they didn't reveal a whole heck of a lot because, you know, of course they still want to keep a lot of their stuff under wraps.

679
00:59:11,431 --> 00:59:13,513
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of new songs that he said.

680
00:59:13,873 --> 00:59:20,978
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's kind of cool the way they set it up because, like, you know how Beat Me is supposed to have 5-key and 7-key functionality?

681
00:59:21,687 --> 00:59:25,268
[SPEAKER_00]: The way you like it in a select screen, you can either choose Beatmania or Beatmania 2DX.

682
00:59:25,288 --> 00:59:28,590
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's kind of like a neat little spin on that.

683
00:59:29,030 --> 00:59:41,894
[SPEAKER_00]: And one little spin that, I don't know if anyone's mentioned this or not, but one thing that America does have, actually let's keep, another thing, well, actually before we get to that, another thing they keep is they actually use unhappy guy naming conventions now.

684
00:59:42,195 --> 00:59:46,976
[SPEAKER_00]: So now things are like beginner or easy or hyper and then, you know, hard.

685
00:59:47,437 --> 00:59:48,577
[SPEAKER_00]: So I thought that was a neat twist.

686
00:59:49,502 --> 01:00:02,146
[SPEAKER_00]: But like, yeah, the main thing that I heard that was confirmed was, you know, it's the how, like, when you watch top-digit videos, or like, you know, you play a song, you triple-aid it, and you think, oh man, how can I prove to people I did this besides the score?

687
01:00:03,186 --> 01:00:06,807
[SPEAKER_00]: 2DXUSA will be offering, you can save your replays.

688
01:00:08,268 --> 01:00:11,149
[SPEAKER_15]: Wow, so you can save replays of songs.

689
01:00:11,349 --> 01:00:12,789
[SPEAKER_15]: Are you going to be able to do anything with the internet?

690
01:00:13,049 --> 01:00:13,229
[SPEAKER_15]: Yep.

691
01:00:13,990 --> 01:00:14,310
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes?

692
01:00:14,730 --> 01:00:15,010
[SPEAKER_15]: What's that?

693
01:00:16,967 --> 01:00:19,329
[SPEAKER_15]: Are you going to be able to do anything with the internet?

694
01:00:20,890 --> 01:00:22,552
[SPEAKER_00]: That wasn't mentioned.

695
01:00:23,733 --> 01:00:33,080
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know about internet online play, but I do know that instant replays of your in-game are available.

696
01:00:34,241 --> 01:00:36,022
[SPEAKER_15]: Very interesting!

697
01:00:37,363 --> 01:00:38,865
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you know, there were a couple.

698
01:00:39,025 --> 01:00:43,168
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we were talking about the Konami style, like the new US controllers.

699
01:00:44,468 --> 01:00:57,122
[SPEAKER_00]: because the thing was they didn't have it on display at games that weekend because essentially, A, it felt like a little bit, you know, getting tested out and stuff, and B, they basically didn't want to get it jacked or broken.

700
01:00:57,682 --> 01:01:04,129
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know how, like, when you go to a place that's open to the public, you know, 2DX will get, I mean, come on, Roseville Golf Land, enough said.

701
01:01:04,810 --> 01:01:06,552
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, gotcha, okay.

702
01:01:07,694 --> 01:01:10,535
[SPEAKER_00]: So they don't so much click, but they don't stick like the old controller does so much.

703
01:01:34,960 --> 01:01:41,726
[SPEAKER_00]: They have a little bit more click than the normal home style controllers, but not as much like total perfect click like say an arcade style.

704
01:01:43,647 --> 01:01:44,488
[SPEAKER_15]: That's the cover shot.

705
01:01:57,367 --> 01:01:58,627
[SPEAKER_15]: That's the cover shot of the game.

706
01:01:58,987 --> 01:01:59,707
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.

707
01:01:59,767 --> 01:02:00,848
[SPEAKER_15]: Are you going to be able to flip?

708
01:02:01,068 --> 01:02:04,928
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, I guess you could still do the flip around the controller thing for either side.

709
01:02:05,228 --> 01:02:05,468
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.

710
01:02:05,989 --> 01:02:07,289
[SPEAKER_00]: As far as I know, yeah, you can flip it.

711
01:02:07,449 --> 01:02:10,169
[SPEAKER_15]: But it's weird because it's rounded on one side now.

712
01:02:10,229 --> 01:02:12,070
[SPEAKER_15]: It's not a completely rectangular controller.

713
01:02:12,090 --> 01:02:14,730
[SPEAKER_15]: It looks like a finger.

714
01:02:16,030 --> 01:02:18,831
[SPEAKER_15]: It's kind of rounded on one side, so that's interesting.

715
01:02:18,991 --> 01:02:21,351
[SPEAKER_15]: All right.

716
01:02:21,851 --> 01:02:25,172
[SPEAKER_15]: Anything else you want to share about what was going on with Beatmania?

717
01:02:26,583 --> 01:02:42,456
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me think, as far as like five key songs and seven key songs, I mean, I don't know, I can't remember what the E3 list was like, but as far as like five key songs, I remember seeing like Hunting for You, Bossa Nova de Fabian, they had Battle Breaks, which I didn't see at E3.

718
01:02:43,216 --> 01:02:43,676
[SPEAKER_22]: Okay, cool.

719
01:02:45,100 --> 01:02:46,781
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, Brattle Bricks, what else was there?

720
01:02:46,822 --> 01:02:49,063
[SPEAKER_00]: Metal Gear, Salting, Paranoia Max.

721
01:02:49,524 --> 01:02:53,787
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, that was like kind of default list almost for E3, except maybe like one or two songs.

722
01:02:54,328 --> 01:02:58,411
[SPEAKER_00]: R7 Key, I mean, the hardest song I saw was Shining Colors, so we thought I'd E3 also.

723
01:02:58,712 --> 01:03:00,733
[SPEAKER_00]: But they also have like the M-Step.

724
01:03:00,994 --> 01:03:02,675
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that song from Six Style?

725
01:03:02,715 --> 01:03:03,696
[SPEAKER_00]: Was it Six Style?

726
01:03:03,716 --> 01:03:04,877
[SPEAKER_00]: No, Six Style.

727
01:03:04,897 --> 01:03:07,459
[SPEAKER_00]: The Shotaro Hirata song, that's like the two-step song.

728
01:03:07,539 --> 01:03:08,600
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, the M-Step 2-1?

729
01:03:08,620 --> 01:03:11,262
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, I know what you're talking about.

730
01:03:11,282 --> 01:03:11,503
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay.

731
01:03:12,657 --> 01:03:13,677
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, they had that song.

732
01:03:13,737 --> 01:03:16,898
[SPEAKER_00]: They had GMD on there, which is surprising.

733
01:03:19,499 --> 01:03:20,480
[SPEAKER_15]: GMD, okay.

734
01:03:20,620 --> 01:03:21,260
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, wow, okay.

735
01:03:21,520 --> 01:03:23,981
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, complicated, like trigonometry.

736
01:03:24,181 --> 01:03:26,042
[SPEAKER_15]: That was like third style, wasn't it?

737
01:03:26,082 --> 01:03:27,242
[SPEAKER_00]: That's an old song.

738
01:03:27,682 --> 01:03:33,484
[SPEAKER_00]: I know, yeah, and the cool thing was they kept a lot of the 2DX videos crossed over to this version.

739
01:03:33,824 --> 01:03:37,366
[SPEAKER_00]: So, like, you know, GMD with the pop locker and the breaker, yeah, you get to see that on there.

740
01:03:38,006 --> 01:03:39,966
[SPEAKER_15]: Now, were the anothers there or not?

741
01:03:40,046 --> 01:03:41,327
[SPEAKER_15]: That's what they're asking in chat.

742
01:03:42,762 --> 01:03:52,325
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, another, I can't remember, I tried playing, like, Shining Polaris, another, but I can't remember if it was or not, you know, because I haven't played that song in a long time.

743
01:03:53,785 --> 01:04:03,047
[SPEAKER_00]: But as far as I know, um, well, from what Jason had told me, as far as another, I heard it's something you have to, uh, possibly might be something you have to unlock.

744
01:04:03,867 --> 01:04:05,448
[SPEAKER_15]: It might be an unlock feature then, okay.

745
01:04:08,462 --> 01:04:13,843
[SPEAKER_15]: Did you see any of the DJ art, the goalie art, the art that shows up when you beat songs?

746
01:04:14,703 --> 01:04:19,565
[SPEAKER_15]: Did you see any of the art, the artwork, the, like, the DJs on the completion screens?

747
01:04:19,625 --> 01:04:24,206
[SPEAKER_00]: They didn't have any artwork, like, you know, when you get, like, you know, the certain gallery unlocks.

748
01:04:24,266 --> 01:04:25,526
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I did not see that at the time.

749
01:04:25,546 --> 01:04:26,847
[SPEAKER_00]: They just only had the staff screen.

750
01:04:27,267 --> 01:04:27,847
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, that's too bad.

751
01:04:28,947 --> 01:04:30,648
[SPEAKER_00]: But that may still be a work in progress.

752
01:04:31,929 --> 01:04:33,470
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's still a work in progress, you never know.

753
01:04:33,831 --> 01:04:44,860
[SPEAKER_00]: But I mean, I hear, like, well, the one thing that somewhat disappointed me was 5C Beat Mania doesn't have their old, like, you know, 16-bit or whatever, like the, you know, those little block type videos.

754
01:04:45,121 --> 01:04:46,562
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, the old style videos.

755
01:04:46,982 --> 01:04:54,909
[SPEAKER_00]: But they, you know, kind of managed to make it a little more sleeker and, like, more or less, you know, recreate some of that stuff.

756
01:04:55,189 --> 01:04:55,810
[SPEAKER_00]: I hear some...

757
01:04:56,512 --> 01:05:02,556
[SPEAKER_00]: Some songs get absolute total new video makeovers, but there really isn't any word which ones or just yet.

758
01:05:03,656 --> 01:05:08,959
[SPEAKER_00]: That pretty much sums up 2DX.

759
01:05:09,720 --> 01:05:15,904
[SPEAKER_00]: What I'll probably do is I'll post on Orange Lounge there a full song list that I did see there because I have it on my video camcorder.

760
01:05:17,933 --> 01:05:19,836
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah, and what else?

761
01:05:20,017 --> 01:05:24,704
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I think that pretty much sums up 2DX's game for today.

762
01:05:24,804 --> 01:05:32,596
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, like I said, a lot of stuff I was able to prioritize just, you know, kind of, you know, because he wasn't really there to, like, answer questions or anything.

763
01:05:32,756 --> 01:05:33,037
[SPEAKER_15]: Right.

764
01:05:35,191 --> 01:05:38,253
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, well, I mean, that's pretty cool, though.

765
01:05:38,653 --> 01:05:42,335
[SPEAKER_15]: I guess maybe it might have been out there about the recording thing.

766
01:05:42,736 --> 01:05:43,476
[SPEAKER_15]: It was hidden.

767
01:05:43,516 --> 01:05:47,378
[SPEAKER_15]: Somebody in their chat room was saying it was kind of hidden on the Music of a New Redirection site.

768
01:05:47,398 --> 01:05:48,239
[SPEAKER_15]: No, it's not exactly hidden.

769
01:05:48,279 --> 01:05:49,300
[SPEAKER_15]: It's listed right on there.

770
01:05:49,340 --> 01:05:49,520
[SPEAKER_14]: Is it?

771
01:05:49,840 --> 01:05:51,061
[SPEAKER_14]: But I didn't know about that before.

772
01:05:51,101 --> 01:05:52,081
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, it says right on there.

773
01:05:52,101 --> 01:05:53,682
[SPEAKER_14]: It's under Game Overview.

774
01:05:54,403 --> 01:05:54,783
[SPEAKER_14]: What happened?

775
01:05:55,363 --> 01:05:57,544
[SPEAKER_15]: I guess that recording thing has been known.

776
01:05:57,644 --> 01:05:58,664
[SPEAKER_15]: I didn't know that, though.

777
01:05:58,744 --> 01:06:01,886
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, so save your performances and play them back for your friends.

778
01:06:01,986 --> 01:06:05,627
[SPEAKER_15]: Somebody in chat said something about it, that it's actually on the Music in Every Direction site.

779
01:06:05,667 --> 01:06:07,148
[SPEAKER_15]: But, okay, interesting.

780
01:06:07,228 --> 01:06:09,488
[SPEAKER_15]: I totally missed that when I looked at the site there.

781
01:06:10,469 --> 01:06:11,949
[SPEAKER_15]: But that's cool about the song list.

782
01:06:11,989 --> 01:06:14,010
[SPEAKER_15]: I did not know about M2 Step Version 1.

783
01:06:14,110 --> 01:06:15,971
[SPEAKER_14]: It does say there's also internet rankings.

784
01:06:16,551 --> 01:06:17,111
[SPEAKER_15]: Really?

785
01:06:17,131 --> 01:06:17,531
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.

786
01:06:17,791 --> 01:06:18,232
[SPEAKER_15]: Interesting.

787
01:06:18,312 --> 01:06:18,872
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, we'll see.

788
01:06:19,611 --> 01:06:26,574
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, thank you for the inside scoop, Mel, and we'll be looking forward to seeing the song list and videos and other reactions over on OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

789
01:06:26,594 --> 01:06:27,015
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, sure.

790
01:06:27,035 --> 01:06:31,317
[SPEAKER_00]: I might probably do a more extensive game write-up on Orange Lounge as well.

791
01:06:31,617 --> 01:06:31,877
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome.

792
01:06:31,917 --> 01:06:33,718
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you see any... There are a lot of other cool things there.

793
01:06:33,898 --> 01:06:36,699
[SPEAKER_15]: Did you see any of the live shows, like Freeze Pop or Zonk?

794
01:06:37,940 --> 01:06:38,540
[SPEAKER_00]: See live shows?

795
01:06:38,580 --> 01:06:41,982
[SPEAKER_00]: You mean as far as the bands or the demos?

796
01:06:42,822 --> 01:06:43,223
[SPEAKER_15]: The bands.

797
01:06:43,303 --> 01:06:43,683
[SPEAKER_00]: The bands?

798
01:06:45,144 --> 01:06:45,824
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, how are the bands?

799
01:06:47,116 --> 01:06:49,938
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh man, yeah, yeah, I actually got to see Zonka Friday night.

800
01:06:51,059 --> 01:06:52,561
[SPEAKER_15]: Awesome, how was it?

801
01:06:53,381 --> 01:06:58,866
[SPEAKER_00]: It was pretty cool, I mean, it's like the first time I've seen the dance since the lead singer actually had her kid a couple months ago.

802
01:06:59,406 --> 01:06:59,686
[SPEAKER_22]: Oh wow.

803
01:07:00,867 --> 01:07:12,517
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I mean, they always put on a great show live, they're one of those acts that, I mean, they may, I mean, they sound pretty decent, like when you listen to it, like, you know, your headphones are both, to see them live, they actually have, they have great showmanship.

804
01:07:13,786 --> 01:07:14,667
[SPEAKER_15]: Great, great.

805
01:07:15,427 --> 01:07:25,695
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm hoping that maybe we can talk to him at some point, because I want to ask him about Love This Feelin' and Tittle Tattle and all that stuff, so we'll see in the future, some point, hopefully.

806
01:07:25,995 --> 01:07:26,336
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

807
01:07:26,816 --> 01:07:32,020
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I'll work on scoring you an interview, because, you know, me and Dave, you know, we gotta like that.

808
01:07:32,240 --> 01:07:32,941
[SPEAKER_15]: Sounds good.

809
01:07:33,081 --> 01:07:35,483
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, Mel, thank you for calling in and giving us the scoop.

810
01:07:35,583 --> 01:07:36,163
[SPEAKER_15]: Appreciate it.

811
01:07:36,243 --> 01:07:38,025
[SPEAKER_15]: Stay tuned to orangelaunchradio.com for more info.

812
01:07:38,652 --> 01:07:39,514
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, no prob.

813
01:07:39,534 --> 01:07:40,356
[SPEAKER_00]: Peace out, people.

814
01:07:40,937 --> 01:07:43,623
[SPEAKER_00]: Time to go listen and make some dinner on the meanwhile.

815
01:07:43,983 --> 01:07:44,364
[SPEAKER_15]: Alright.

816
01:07:44,785 --> 01:07:45,306
[SPEAKER_00]: Take care, buddy.

817
01:07:45,346 --> 01:07:45,687
[SPEAKER_00]: Bye-bye.

818
01:07:47,921 --> 01:07:48,241
[SPEAKER_15]: All right.

819
01:07:48,381 --> 01:07:51,183
[SPEAKER_15]: A little difficulty there with the connection, it sounds like there.

820
01:07:51,223 --> 01:07:53,965
[SPEAKER_15]: But Mel, we can clearly hear him.

821
01:07:54,185 --> 01:07:55,626
[SPEAKER_15]: He's having a hard time understanding us, I think.

822
01:07:55,646 --> 01:07:58,188
[SPEAKER_15]: But we can clearly hear him talking about Beatmania.

823
01:07:58,548 --> 01:08:08,115
[SPEAKER_15]: Didn't end up actually getting shown at game until today, but it does look like that they are going to call 2DX is the other mode in Beatmania.

824
01:08:09,115 --> 01:08:12,177
[SPEAKER_15]: And then we have M2 Step 1 and all that.

825
01:08:13,898 --> 01:08:16,300
[SPEAKER_15]: Actually, I don't know if he said 2DX was the other mode.

826
01:08:16,440 --> 01:08:17,161
[SPEAKER_15]: He actually said it was 2DX.

827
01:08:18,141 --> 01:08:22,003
[SPEAKER_14]: No, it's Beatmania 2DX, and it's also Beatmania.

828
01:08:22,403 --> 01:08:25,464
[SPEAKER_14]: It's on all their screens.

829
01:08:25,824 --> 01:08:27,625
[SPEAKER_14]: No, it's in the screenshot.

830
01:08:27,745 --> 01:08:28,906
[SPEAKER_15]: I wish, I wish, I've been great.

831
01:08:29,806 --> 01:08:35,748
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, but that's nice, though, that they call it at least 2DX, and like a little bit of a throwback to what's going on on the Japanese side.

832
01:08:37,449 --> 01:08:39,450
[SPEAKER_15]: The M two-step song is in it.

833
01:08:40,230 --> 01:08:41,591
[SPEAKER_15]: In My Eyes, Hitchhiker...

834
01:08:42,031 --> 01:08:44,173
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, that's from these screen caps we see, right?

835
01:08:44,333 --> 01:08:45,814
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, these are probably the latest build, though.

836
01:08:45,834 --> 01:08:48,136
[SPEAKER_14]: These are ones that are on Music in Every Direction.

837
01:08:48,697 --> 01:08:55,903
[SPEAKER_14]: I was the one, GMD, M02 step, version 1.01.

838
01:08:56,804 --> 01:08:58,105
[SPEAKER_14]: What a dumb name for a song.

839
01:09:00,046 --> 01:09:01,808
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.

840
01:09:02,048 --> 01:09:05,531
[SPEAKER_15]: We are getting hammered on the Skype line tonight, so we better hurry up and get to another call.

841
01:09:05,591 --> 01:09:06,832
[SPEAKER_15]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

842
01:09:07,713 --> 01:09:08,694
[SPEAKER_15]: Hey, Sky, Siggy here.

843
01:09:08,934 --> 01:09:10,055
[SPEAKER_15]: Hi, Siggy, what's on your mind?

844
01:09:11,209 --> 01:09:17,190
[SPEAKER_15]: You forgot to mention V. Fuck V. I mean, seriously.

845
01:09:17,631 --> 01:09:18,951
[SPEAKER_15]: Fuck V. It's done.

846
01:09:19,011 --> 01:09:19,611
[SPEAKER_15]: Who cares?

847
01:09:19,831 --> 01:09:21,051
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't care about V anymore.

848
01:09:21,431 --> 01:09:23,832
[SPEAKER_15]: V was cool like three years ago, okay?

849
01:09:25,172 --> 01:09:30,674
[SPEAKER_15]: I want some W. Don't call back until you guys tell me that W's in it.

850
01:09:30,714 --> 01:09:34,014
[SPEAKER_05]: No, next we're going to have H for Handel.

851
01:09:36,235 --> 01:09:37,537
[SPEAKER_15]: Wow, that was nerdy.

852
01:09:38,838 --> 01:09:40,761
[SPEAKER_05]: Excuse me, I was a music major at one time.

853
01:09:40,841 --> 01:09:41,382
[SPEAKER_15]: I know, I know.

854
01:09:42,483 --> 01:09:53,096
[SPEAKER_15]: But no, I understand that the fanboys would be very pissed if V didn't show up, so we do have to mention some V. Well, other than that, I have to make some correction.

855
01:09:54,658 --> 01:09:54,979
[SPEAKER_23]: Okay.

856
01:09:58,883 --> 01:10:03,386
[SPEAKER_23]: You said that the 2DX13 distorted location test is going on right now?

857
01:10:03,966 --> 01:10:05,587
[SPEAKER_15]: It just finished, right?

858
01:10:06,828 --> 01:10:08,069
[SPEAKER_23]: But it just finished.

859
01:10:08,509 --> 01:10:13,492
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh yeah, I remember reading, I think you and Chad or somebody had said something that it had just finished.

860
01:10:13,533 --> 01:10:16,975
[SPEAKER_15]: But yeah, it was going on, so it just finished though.

861
01:10:17,075 --> 01:10:17,535
[SPEAKER_15]: That's too bad.

862
01:10:19,582 --> 01:10:23,603
[SPEAKER_23]: Anyway, are you going to play the Guitadora V2 songs?

863
01:10:24,103 --> 01:10:25,504
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes, I'm going to do it.

864
01:10:25,684 --> 01:10:26,824
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm going to play them next break.

865
01:10:27,064 --> 01:10:27,445
[SPEAKER_15]: Some of them.

866
01:10:29,025 --> 01:10:31,966
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm going to pick four that you sent me with cool titles and do them next break.

867
01:10:33,206 --> 01:10:36,788
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, go with the Vanilla Ninja song first since it's your favorite.

868
01:10:37,408 --> 01:10:38,168
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, fuck yes.

869
01:10:38,228 --> 01:10:39,108
[SPEAKER_15]: I love Vanilla Ninja.

870
01:10:39,128 --> 01:10:40,889
[SPEAKER_15]: What song did they put in in V2 by them?

871
01:10:42,829 --> 01:10:44,470
[SPEAKER_15]: Metal Queen.

872
01:10:45,150 --> 01:10:45,570
[SPEAKER_15]: Sounds good.

873
01:10:45,630 --> 01:10:46,291
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay.

874
01:10:46,311 --> 01:10:47,351
[SPEAKER_15]: I'll definitely play that one.

875
01:10:48,732 --> 01:10:54,374
[SPEAKER_15]: What do you think about all this Beatmania US news?

876
01:10:54,454 --> 01:11:04,556
[SPEAKER_23]: I was a little disappointed when I found out that it wasn't shown yesterday, thanks to Rich, who was there yesterday.

877
01:11:07,017 --> 01:11:10,778
[SPEAKER_15]: A little technical foul up there, but now we understand what's going on.

878
01:11:10,838 --> 01:11:12,339
[SPEAKER_15]: What do you think about the recording mode?

879
01:11:12,399 --> 01:11:13,699
[SPEAKER_15]: I think that's kind of interesting.

880
01:11:15,089 --> 01:11:19,671
[SPEAKER_23]: Hmm, yeah, I'll think about that, but I wasn't surprised.

881
01:11:20,232 --> 01:11:40,082
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, seems like, I guess, I think, I think it shows that Konami might be kind of looking on what's going out there on the internet right now, like, what do the fans of 2DX seem to really get into, and what do they want in the game, and maybe they kind of picked up on the whole, like, you know, VJ Army tracking thing, and maybe they thought it was something they could build into the game, don't know, just a thought, I don't know.

882
01:11:41,710 --> 01:11:42,471
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

883
01:11:43,352 --> 01:11:45,254
[SPEAKER_23]: Well, Siggy, anything else you want to share with us?

884
01:11:46,495 --> 01:11:51,020
[SPEAKER_23]: Well, nothing much else at the moment, but yeah.

885
01:11:51,201 --> 01:11:51,401
[SPEAKER_23]: Okay.

886
01:11:51,621 --> 01:11:53,503
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, I appreciate the call as always.

887
01:11:53,523 --> 01:11:55,585
[SPEAKER_15]: We're going to get to some other calls because we're getting hammered tonight.

888
01:11:55,906 --> 01:11:56,887
[SPEAKER_15]: But have a good one, okay, buddy?

889
01:11:57,267 --> 01:11:57,488
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.

890
01:11:57,708 --> 01:11:57,968
[SPEAKER_15]: All right.

891
01:11:58,409 --> 01:11:58,509
[SPEAKER_15]: Later.

892
01:11:58,529 --> 01:11:58,669
[SPEAKER_15]: Later.

893
01:11:59,370 --> 01:11:59,570
[SPEAKER_15]: Later.

894
01:12:00,413 --> 01:12:04,276
[SPEAKER_15]: Alright, Siggy reminding us that Gita Dora V2 stuff is ready to go.

895
01:12:04,336 --> 01:12:05,937
[SPEAKER_15]: He sent us some songs from there.

896
01:12:06,197 --> 01:12:07,778
[SPEAKER_15]: So we're going to check that out during the next break.

897
01:12:08,078 --> 01:12:10,800
[SPEAKER_15]: Because I'm excited to hear some of this stuff, so we're going to do that.

898
01:12:10,840 --> 01:12:11,781
[SPEAKER_15]: Let's go to another call.

899
01:12:11,821 --> 01:12:12,761
[SPEAKER_15]: Lots and lots to pick from.

900
01:12:13,582 --> 01:12:16,624
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh my gosh, I'm just going to pick the one that was on the line first.

901
01:12:17,404 --> 01:12:18,365
[SPEAKER_15]: Hi, you're on Orange Lawn Radio.

902
01:12:20,506 --> 01:12:20,767
[SPEAKER_15]: Hello.

903
01:12:22,127 --> 01:12:22,448
[SPEAKER_15]: Hello.

904
01:12:22,808 --> 01:12:23,889
[SPEAKER_15]: Hi, who is this?

905
01:12:26,150 --> 01:12:26,710
[SPEAKER_22]: It's Antenna Man 64.

906
01:12:27,762 --> 01:12:30,625
[SPEAKER_15]: Hello Nintendomaniac64, what's on your mind, buddy?

907
01:12:32,807 --> 01:12:35,049
[SPEAKER_22]: Uh, playing Mario Kart as we speak.

908
01:12:35,649 --> 01:12:36,190
[SPEAKER_22]: It's awesome.

909
01:12:37,471 --> 01:12:38,132
[SPEAKER_15]: Still playing?

910
01:12:38,192 --> 01:12:41,355
[SPEAKER_15]: Are you able to find friends on there?

911
01:12:41,415 --> 01:12:46,239
[SPEAKER_15]: Because every time I go in to do a friends matchup, my friends are never online.

912
01:12:46,360 --> 01:12:47,461
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't even bother anymore.

913
01:12:51,084 --> 01:12:53,046
[SPEAKER_15]: I pretty much do rivals mode a lot.

914
01:12:54,878 --> 01:13:03,247
[SPEAKER_15]: I haven't done Rivals, but I hear that Rivals is a good way to find people at your own skill level, so I need to do that one more often because otherwise I get my ass kicked almost every time.

915
01:13:03,327 --> 01:13:08,994
[SPEAKER_15]: So I need to get matched up against some seven-year-olds so I can have a sense of accomplishment when I actually beat it.

916
01:13:09,354 --> 01:13:09,495
[SPEAKER_15]: But...

917
01:13:10,035 --> 01:13:13,557
[SPEAKER_15]: You know, I actually played Mario Kart DS this last week.

918
01:13:13,617 --> 01:13:22,320
[SPEAKER_15]: I played with several other people that have DSs, and we actually played the mode where you can broadcast the game, you can download the game.

919
01:13:22,560 --> 01:13:29,663
[SPEAKER_15]: What I thought was kind of cool, and I haven't really seen this in a lot of DS games, is that you can mix and match people that have the game and people that don't have the game.

920
01:13:30,063 --> 01:13:33,144
[SPEAKER_15]: You can play multiplayer mode with people that do and don't have the game.

921
01:13:33,485 --> 01:13:36,506
[SPEAKER_15]: And basically, anybody that doesn't have the game will be a shy guy,

922
01:13:36,986 --> 01:14:01,162
[SPEAKER_15]: which isn't even a character that you can unlock in the normal game so I thought that was kind of weird because I hear the Shy Guy actually has like just a perfectly balanced average car so my friends are actually doing very well with the Shy Guy cars but everybody else who has the game will get to pick from any character and unfortunately when you're playing with anybody that doesn't have the game you can only pick from one battle track and I think eight of the typical race courses.

923
01:14:01,182 --> 01:14:06,105
[SPEAKER_15]: You can do anything in the first Retro Cup and in the first Mario DS Cup.

924
01:14:07,086 --> 01:14:07,847
[SPEAKER_15]: It was interesting, though.

925
01:14:07,867 --> 01:14:08,367
[SPEAKER_15]: It was a good time.

926
01:14:09,328 --> 01:14:15,154
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, maybe the Shire is supposed to give a bit of a handicap for those people who don't have it, so they don't have as much practice.

927
01:14:15,514 --> 01:14:15,894
[SPEAKER_22]: I don't know.

928
01:14:17,255 --> 01:14:23,301
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, that might be a good point, is that they do the balanced car because those people don't have practice, like the rest of us addicts do.

929
01:14:23,681 --> 01:14:24,302
[SPEAKER_15]: That's a good thought.

930
01:14:24,782 --> 01:14:27,305
[SPEAKER_15]: Are you going to be online with Animal Crossing this week?

931
01:14:31,321 --> 01:14:33,543
[SPEAKER_22]: I might pick up the game, but maybe not this week.

932
01:14:34,884 --> 01:14:42,470
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm still kind of thinking about it, because I didn't really... I'm not too much of an Animal Crossing fan, but the online sounds really cool.

933
01:14:43,571 --> 01:14:44,492
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm excited about this.

934
01:14:44,772 --> 01:14:45,072
[SPEAKER_15]: We'll see.

935
01:14:45,392 --> 01:14:46,153
[SPEAKER_15]: I can understand, though.

936
01:14:46,193 --> 01:14:50,336
[SPEAKER_15]: Animal Crossing is a very quirky sort of game, so I can see where...

937
01:14:51,397 --> 01:14:55,899
[SPEAKER_15]: It might not be, like, you're jumping at the chance, trying to get it, so, okay.

938
01:14:56,119 --> 01:15:00,240
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, I'm very curious to see how the online stuff is going to work, too, because we don't really know.

939
01:15:00,640 --> 01:15:10,504
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, we hear how things are supposed to work, but we haven't really seen it in motion a whole lot except E3, which wasn't exactly a tell-all type situation.

940
01:15:10,604 --> 01:15:11,644
[SPEAKER_15]: So, we'll see.

941
01:15:11,824 --> 01:15:12,165
[SPEAKER_15]: We'll see.

942
01:15:13,965 --> 01:15:15,246
[SPEAKER_15]: Anything else you want to share with our listeners?

943
01:15:16,546 --> 01:15:18,967
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, my L button on my DS is crapped out.

944
01:15:19,915 --> 01:15:20,695
[SPEAKER_22]: That sucks.

945
01:15:20,796 --> 01:15:22,196
[SPEAKER_22]: Can you do a warranty thing?

946
01:15:22,236 --> 01:15:23,217
[SPEAKER_22]: Did you email Nintendo?

947
01:15:24,498 --> 01:15:26,679
[SPEAKER_22]: Unfortunately, my DS just came out of warranty.

948
01:15:27,359 --> 01:15:28,080
[SPEAKER_22]: Ouch.

949
01:15:28,660 --> 01:15:30,721
[SPEAKER_22]: That is so typical.

950
01:15:31,762 --> 01:15:33,063
[SPEAKER_22]: But what?

951
01:15:35,044 --> 01:15:44,069
[SPEAKER_22]: We got it on a credit card that will actually allow us to extend the warranty for just, I don't know how long, but apparently they can cover it, which is really cool.

952
01:15:45,054 --> 01:15:54,761
[SPEAKER_15]: that's pretty awesome I never would have thought of that and that's actually probably a good tip especially this time of year for people that are listening if your shit breaks especially like

953
01:15:55,458 --> 01:15:56,338
[SPEAKER_15]: Goddamn my microphone.

954
01:15:56,939 --> 01:16:14,627
[SPEAKER_15]: If your stuff breaks, don't just check with the manufacturer, check with your credit card company because there may be some type of extension warranty or something else that might be available to you.

955
01:16:14,707 --> 01:16:15,928
[SPEAKER_15]: Sorry to break your ears there.

956
01:16:18,644 --> 01:16:20,665
[SPEAKER_15]: I swear to God, this mic is so fiery.

957
01:16:21,226 --> 01:16:28,291
[SPEAKER_15]: There might be something else available to you on your credit card warranty that goes beyond the manufacturer.

958
01:16:28,871 --> 01:16:29,431
[SPEAKER_15]: There, finally.

959
01:16:30,592 --> 01:16:31,233
[SPEAKER_15]: So check out.

960
01:16:32,954 --> 01:16:33,494
[SPEAKER_15]: Good tip.

961
01:16:33,554 --> 01:16:34,615
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you for reminding us.

962
01:16:36,297 --> 01:16:39,159
[SPEAKER_22]: Okay, yeah, I pretty much just use the X button for items now.

963
01:16:40,820 --> 01:16:44,023
[SPEAKER_15]: But see, that's tough with the finger and everything.

964
01:16:44,343 --> 01:16:44,883
[SPEAKER_15]: I can't do that.

965
01:16:44,943 --> 01:16:45,744
[SPEAKER_15]: I need my L button.

966
01:16:46,625 --> 01:16:47,445
[SPEAKER_15]: I love my L button.

967
01:16:49,527 --> 01:17:00,915
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, I mean, at first I didn't think I'd be able to do it, but all I do is I just move my... My thumb is still holding down A. My nail actually hits the X button, not my actual finger.

968
01:17:01,375 --> 01:17:07,062
[SPEAKER_22]: So if I had cut my nails, I probably wouldn't be able to hit X. Well, a good incentive not to be biting those nails.

969
01:17:07,383 --> 01:17:08,184
[SPEAKER_15]: Don't bite them nails.

970
01:17:08,744 --> 01:17:09,005
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.

971
01:17:09,545 --> 01:17:10,987
[SPEAKER_15]: Except I just bit one of them.

972
01:17:12,349 --> 01:17:12,709
[SPEAKER_22]: Alright.

973
01:17:13,951 --> 01:17:14,351
[SPEAKER_22]: Alright.

974
01:17:14,692 --> 01:17:14,832
[SPEAKER_22]: Oh!

975
01:17:16,173 --> 01:17:16,794
[SPEAKER_22]: I got other stuff.

976
01:17:17,055 --> 01:17:17,255
[SPEAKER_22]: Okay.

977
01:17:19,720 --> 01:17:23,742
[SPEAKER_22]: Last night I went on a huge StepMania song downloading spree.

978
01:17:24,242 --> 01:17:24,802
[SPEAKER_22]: And what'd you find?

979
01:17:24,842 --> 01:17:25,322
[SPEAKER_22]: Anything good?

980
01:17:28,063 --> 01:17:38,487
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, I did find some official DDR songs and stuff, like Butterfly, Mr. Wonderful, things like those.

981
01:17:39,087 --> 01:17:39,947
[SPEAKER_22]: That shit's old.

982
01:17:40,327 --> 01:17:41,468
[SPEAKER_22]: That shit is so old.

983
01:17:41,668 --> 01:17:41,908
[SPEAKER_22]: I know.

984
01:17:43,208 --> 01:17:47,870
[SPEAKER_22]: I don't have any kind of PlayStation and stuff, so I've never even played the games.

985
01:17:47,910 --> 01:17:53,711
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, that's where the simulator stuff can be kind of fun, is that you can download the old shit you might have missed out on.

986
01:17:55,272 --> 01:17:59,433
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, and I actually completely recreated Sandstorm on every difficulty.

987
01:18:00,974 --> 01:18:01,334
[SPEAKER_22]: Wow.

988
01:18:02,294 --> 01:18:02,434
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.

989
01:18:05,629 --> 01:18:06,689
[SPEAKER_15]: That's a lot of Raven.

990
01:18:09,650 --> 01:18:18,133
[SPEAKER_15]: Alright, well, Nintendo Maniac, we've got to let you go because we're going to try and get at least one more call before we go to break, but thank you for calling in, and good luck with that L button.

991
01:18:19,153 --> 01:18:19,453
[SPEAKER_15]: Thanks.

992
01:18:19,593 --> 01:18:20,514
[SPEAKER_15]: Alright, take care.

993
01:18:20,754 --> 01:18:21,494
[SPEAKER_15]: By the way, I'm winning.

994
01:18:22,094 --> 01:18:22,694
[SPEAKER_15]: By the way, what?

995
01:18:23,795 --> 01:18:24,215
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm winning.

996
01:18:24,495 --> 01:18:26,135
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, kick some ass.

997
01:18:27,736 --> 01:18:28,396
[SPEAKER_15]: Kick some ass.

998
01:18:28,576 --> 01:18:29,457
[SPEAKER_15]: Have fun, buddy.

999
01:18:29,657 --> 01:18:29,877
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.

1000
01:18:30,237 --> 01:18:30,497
[SPEAKER_15]: Later.

1001
01:18:34,271 --> 01:18:36,712
[SPEAKER_15]: One more call, call, call, call.

1002
01:18:36,752 --> 01:18:37,853
[SPEAKER_15]: Let's see, how about this one?

1003
01:18:38,993 --> 01:18:39,874
[SPEAKER_15]: Hi, on Orange Sounds Radio.

1004
01:18:41,994 --> 01:18:43,755
[SPEAKER_24]: Hey, this is SSJ100 Matt here.

1005
01:18:43,935 --> 01:18:45,516
[SPEAKER_15]: Hello, SSJ100 Matt here.

1006
01:18:45,536 --> 01:18:46,096
[SPEAKER_15]: What's on your mind?

1007
01:18:49,237 --> 01:18:52,359
[SPEAKER_24]: Actually, I got some minor news for myself.

1008
01:18:54,720 --> 01:18:59,802
[SPEAKER_24]: I got special advanced press screenings to the movie Grandma's Boy.

1009
01:19:00,765 --> 01:19:06,050
[SPEAKER_15]: Grandma's Blood, oh, this is the Adam Sandler movie where he plays like a game tester or something, huh?

1010
01:19:06,150 --> 01:19:06,890
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, yeah.

1011
01:19:07,030 --> 01:19:08,572
[SPEAKER_15]: Did you actually see the movie?

1012
01:19:10,513 --> 01:19:13,856
[SPEAKER_24]: Well, no, the advanced screening is for this Thursday.

1013
01:19:13,976 --> 01:19:14,377
[SPEAKER_24]: Oh, okay.

1014
01:19:14,857 --> 01:19:18,600
[SPEAKER_14]: It's not Adam Sandler, it's, what's his name, I don't remember the guy's name.

1015
01:19:18,700 --> 01:19:19,301
[SPEAKER_14]: Rob Schneider?

1016
01:19:19,681 --> 01:19:20,622
[SPEAKER_14]: That's not Rob Schneider.

1017
01:19:20,962 --> 01:19:21,963
[SPEAKER_14]: I thought it was Adam Sandler.

1018
01:19:22,003 --> 01:19:22,363
[SPEAKER_14]: I know him.

1019
01:19:23,264 --> 01:19:24,685
[SPEAKER_14]: No, he, it's Happy Madness.

1020
01:19:24,745 --> 01:19:25,406
[SPEAKER_24]: Alan something.

1021
01:19:26,584 --> 01:19:30,306
[SPEAKER_14]: Happy Madison is the one doing the production.

1022
01:19:30,606 --> 01:19:33,747
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't remember who.

1023
01:19:33,767 --> 01:19:34,927
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, some person.

1024
01:19:36,908 --> 01:19:38,429
[SPEAKER_15]: So how did you manage to get this ticket?

1025
01:19:40,236 --> 01:19:48,319
[SPEAKER_24]: Well, the television studio that I worked at was giving out, like, it's like, okay, we have 12 tickets, who wants them?

1026
01:19:48,660 --> 01:19:50,840
[SPEAKER_24]: And I just jumped on top of two, so.

1027
01:19:50,961 --> 01:19:51,641
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, that was easy.

1028
01:19:51,681 --> 01:19:52,961
[SPEAKER_15]: Those fell in your lap, didn't they?

1029
01:19:53,141 --> 01:19:54,382
[SPEAKER_15]: That must be nice.

1030
01:19:54,802 --> 01:19:55,062
[SPEAKER_24]: Yeah.

1031
01:19:56,163 --> 01:20:08,788
[SPEAKER_24]: So, the premiere is Thursday, and they're going to make a big deal out of it, and they're going to have EA Sports going to be showing off games before the screening.

1032
01:20:10,546 --> 01:20:11,006
[SPEAKER_15]: Very cool.

1033
01:20:11,067 --> 01:20:12,988
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm looking at some of these people who are in the movie.

1034
01:20:13,068 --> 01:20:15,110
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't recognize any of these people at all.

1035
01:20:15,491 --> 01:20:18,673
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, there's Rob Schneider is in it, and David Spade, and Kevin Nealon.

1036
01:20:18,693 --> 01:20:21,396
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, this is like an early 90s Saturday Night Live thing going on here.

1037
01:20:22,341 --> 01:20:27,342
[SPEAKER_24]: Yeah, and the old woman from... Doris Roberts' grandma.

1038
01:20:27,482 --> 01:20:27,802
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.

1039
01:20:28,802 --> 01:20:29,182
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay.

1040
01:20:29,582 --> 01:20:32,483
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm trying to look at the poster here.

1041
01:20:32,763 --> 01:20:34,023
[SPEAKER_15]: I love Internet Movie Database.

1042
01:20:34,043 --> 01:20:35,743
[SPEAKER_15]: It answers all my movie questions.

1043
01:20:35,883 --> 01:20:37,124
[SPEAKER_15]: They didn't pay me to say that, even.

1044
01:20:37,184 --> 01:20:38,504
[SPEAKER_15]: I really do love this one.

1045
01:20:40,484 --> 01:20:43,405
[SPEAKER_15]: Linda Cardellini... Oh, they've got a lot of people in this movie.

1046
01:20:44,425 --> 01:20:47,045
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, well, that should be interesting.

1047
01:20:49,246 --> 01:20:51,306
[SPEAKER_24]: Supposedly, Kevin Nealon's supposed to show up, so...

1048
01:20:54,094 --> 01:20:59,215
[SPEAKER_24]: Hopefully I can give him my business card or something so he can hire me for a movie or something.

1049
01:20:59,755 --> 01:21:00,716
[SPEAKER_15]: It's the Hollywood way.

1050
01:21:00,736 --> 01:21:01,416
[SPEAKER_15]: That would be awesome.

1051
01:21:03,636 --> 01:21:04,997
[SPEAKER_15]: What was I going to say about this movie?

1052
01:21:05,237 --> 01:21:07,277
[SPEAKER_15]: You'll call back and let us know if it's good or not, right?

1053
01:21:07,437 --> 01:21:07,838
[SPEAKER_15]: Next week?

1054
01:21:09,198 --> 01:21:09,758
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, next week.

1055
01:21:11,138 --> 01:21:11,679
[SPEAKER_15]: Sounds good.

1056
01:21:13,299 --> 01:21:14,539
[SPEAKER_15]: Anything else you want to share with our listeners?

1057
01:21:14,759 --> 01:21:17,780
[SPEAKER_15]: Besides rubbing it in that you get to go to a movie premiere and we don't?

1058
01:21:21,752 --> 01:21:30,282
[SPEAKER_24]: Well, the movie comes out January 6th, so... That's not a good sign because January is when the studios unload their crap.

1059
01:21:31,504 --> 01:21:33,286
[SPEAKER_15]: Didn't Resident Evil 2 come out in January?

1060
01:21:33,586 --> 01:21:37,271
[SPEAKER_15]: No, but a wonderful movie called BloodRayne is coming out in January.

1061
01:21:37,331 --> 01:21:40,134
[SPEAKER_15]: Like I said, that's when the studios unload all our crap.

1062
01:21:40,735 --> 01:21:41,536
[SPEAKER_15]: No, I don't know.

1063
01:21:41,696 --> 01:21:42,297
[SPEAKER_15]: It might be fun.

1064
01:21:42,617 --> 01:21:51,605
[SPEAKER_15]: Just let us know if it makes gamers look like dumbasses or not, because I'm very interested to see what happens with another gaming movie and all that stuff.

1065
01:21:51,625 --> 01:21:53,486
[SPEAKER_24]: Yeah.

1066
01:21:54,007 --> 01:21:54,287
[SPEAKER_24]: All right.

1067
01:21:56,709 --> 01:21:57,810
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, that's it.

1068
01:21:58,251 --> 01:21:58,811
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay.

1069
01:21:58,931 --> 01:21:59,952
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, thanks for calling in.

1070
01:22:00,072 --> 01:22:00,773
[SPEAKER_15]: Have fun at the movie.

1071
01:22:00,813 --> 01:22:01,494
[SPEAKER_15]: Let us know how it goes.

1072
01:22:01,514 --> 01:22:01,774
[SPEAKER_15]: All righty?

1073
01:22:03,436 --> 01:22:04,177
[SPEAKER_15]: All right, later.

1074
01:22:05,157 --> 01:22:05,398
[SPEAKER_15]: Bye.

1075
01:22:06,238 --> 01:22:06,678
[SPEAKER_15]: Yep, bye.

1076
01:22:07,399 --> 01:22:08,220
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay.

1077
01:22:09,360 --> 01:22:13,524
[SPEAKER_15]: Call there from SSJ100 Matt, who, by the way, is looking for a job in the industry.

1078
01:22:13,584 --> 01:22:19,388
[SPEAKER_15]: So if you know a rich producer, he wants a job, so give him a job.

1079
01:22:20,369 --> 01:22:21,870
[SPEAKER_15]: We want a job, too, actually.

1080
01:22:22,710 --> 01:22:23,351
[SPEAKER_15]: We could use a job.

1081
01:22:23,431 --> 01:22:28,054
[SPEAKER_15]: I would sell My Immortal Soul to do Orange Lounge on TV or something.

1082
01:22:28,074 --> 01:22:28,535
[SPEAKER_15]: That would be fun.

1083
01:22:29,616 --> 01:22:30,756
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know how to do it on TV.

1084
01:22:30,776 --> 01:22:31,397
[SPEAKER_05]: I like the radio.

1085
01:22:31,957 --> 01:22:32,638
[SPEAKER_15]: Radio is fun, but...

1086
01:22:33,530 --> 01:22:33,830
[SPEAKER_15]: Gita Dora V

1087
01:23:01,109 --> 01:23:02,830
[SPEAKER_15]: Because it's called Twinkleberry.

1088
01:23:02,890 --> 01:23:03,751
[SPEAKER_15]: How can it be bad?

1089
01:23:04,171 --> 01:23:05,572
[SPEAKER_05]: It sounds too much like Dingleberry.

1090
01:23:05,632 --> 01:23:06,192
[SPEAKER_15]: And then I'm curious.

1091
01:23:06,212 --> 01:23:07,273
[SPEAKER_15]: We're going to hear a Tara song.

1092
01:23:07,293 --> 01:23:11,876
[SPEAKER_15]: And I'm really curious if Model DD7 has anything to do with the other model song that's been in.

1093
01:23:11,896 --> 01:23:12,796
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, it does.

1094
01:23:12,936 --> 01:23:13,157
[SPEAKER_14]: Good.

1095
01:23:13,177 --> 01:23:13,737
[SPEAKER_15]: Then we'll hear it.

1096
01:23:14,037 --> 01:23:15,258
[SPEAKER_14]: There's been like tons of them.

1097
01:23:15,598 --> 01:23:15,878
[SPEAKER_15]: All right.

1098
01:23:15,918 --> 01:23:16,519
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, we'll see.

1099
01:23:17,459 --> 01:23:21,702
[SPEAKER_15]: So we'll be back after this with more Orange Launch Radio and maybe some more Skype if you kids are good.

1100
01:23:38,095 --> 01:23:41,756
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

[SPEAKER_08]: Tart, tart,毎日タルト、タルト、とてもおいしいタルト、タルト、毎晩タルト、タルト、やめられないよタルト

1104
01:25:56,085 --> 01:26:01,749
[SPEAKER_08]: My favorite thing on that day was him, but if you compare it to a tart, it's too much for me, I'm sorry.

1105
01:26:02,070 --> 01:26:06,593
[SPEAKER_08]: A tart, a tart, a magical tart, a tart, I'm scared of the aftertaste.

1106
01:26:06,673 --> 01:26:09,835
[SPEAKER_08]: A tart, a tart, another tart, a tart, a sweet and painful tart.

1107
01:26:25,077 --> 01:26:26,578
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you for watching.

[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you for watching!

1113
01:28:17,941 --> 01:28:21,502
[SPEAKER_08]: There was a time when magic suddenly melted.

1114
01:28:21,642 --> 01:28:24,203
[SPEAKER_08]: It became more and more dangerous than before.

1115
01:28:24,243 --> 01:28:25,904
[SPEAKER_08]: The tart was a tart.

1116
01:28:33,733 --> 01:28:34,854

[SPEAKER_08]: I don't want to be bothered by the noise.

1119
01:29:10,159 --> 01:29:11,881
I don't want to be bothered by the noise.

1120
01:29:30,982 --> 01:29:34,484
I don't want to lose hope in an age when the sun is about to rise.

1121
01:29:34,544 --> 01:29:36,004
I'm going to fly over the sky.

1122
01:29:36,084 --> 01:29:37,605
I'm going to fly over the sky.

1123
01:29:37,685 --> 01:29:39,126
I'm going to fly over the sky.

1124
01:29:39,186 --> 01:29:40,286
I'm going to fly over the sky.

1125
01:29:40,366 --> 01:29:41,507
I'm going to fly over the sky.

1126
01:29:41,587 --> 01:29:42,827
I'm going to fly over the sky.

1127
01:30:06,503 --> 01:30:07,244

and many more.

1132
01:32:50,126 --> 01:32:54,910
[SPEAKER_08]: From the Step Squad to Orange Lab, this GDR sucks!

1133
01:32:55,010 --> 01:32:58,633
[SPEAKER_08]: Holler, holler, holler, holler, holler, holler, holler, holler!

1134
01:33:03,988 --> 01:33:05,769
[SPEAKER_15]: Welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio.

1135
01:33:06,209 --> 01:33:10,411
[SPEAKER_15]: And in that break we heard a whole clusterfuck of music from Gita Dora V2.

1136
01:33:11,312 --> 01:33:19,376
[SPEAKER_15]: And I understand that people are leaving listening to our show to go watch other things on television, like the Boondocks or Family Guy.

1137
01:33:19,616 --> 01:33:22,477
[SPEAKER_15]: TV addicts, you need to get off of your butts.

1138
01:33:22,737 --> 01:33:25,659
[SPEAKER_15]: You bitches need to get a TiVo or a BitTorrent.

1139
01:33:25,679 --> 01:33:26,199
[SPEAKER_14]: Screw TiVo.

1140
01:33:26,259 --> 01:33:28,060
[SPEAKER_14]: BitTorrent, yeah, BitTorrent is the way to go.

1141
01:33:28,180 --> 01:33:31,241
[SPEAKER_14]: It's on before the show is even on.

1142
01:33:31,461 --> 01:33:31,902
[SPEAKER_13]: It's on demand.

1143
01:33:31,922 --> 01:33:32,142
[SPEAKER_13]: You can...

1144
01:33:32,922 --> 01:33:37,423
[SPEAKER_14]: You can literally, if you have news groups, I do this almost every week.

1145
01:33:37,723 --> 01:33:40,824
[SPEAKER_14]: When I get done with the show, I go watch my episode of Family Guy.

1146
01:33:41,425 --> 01:33:42,265
[SPEAKER_14]: There you go.

1147
01:33:42,465 --> 01:33:43,545
[SPEAKER_15]: After the show!

1148
01:33:43,745 --> 01:33:44,766
[SPEAKER_15]: That's how you do it.

1149
01:33:46,226 --> 01:33:48,907
[SPEAKER_15]: So I'm just poking fun at people that dare ditch us.

1150
01:33:49,807 --> 01:33:51,387
[SPEAKER_05]: Because the government has access to it.

1151
01:33:52,588 --> 01:33:54,768
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh no, the government knows I watch Will and Grace.

1152
01:33:55,189 --> 01:33:55,789
[SPEAKER_15]: What am I going to do?

1153
01:33:59,188 --> 01:34:00,810
[SPEAKER_15]: The government might think I'm gay.

1154
01:34:17,412 --> 01:34:21,854
[SPEAKER_15]: Anyway, um... Where were we going?

1155
01:34:21,874 --> 01:34:24,095
[SPEAKER_15]: Hail in a handbasket!

1156
01:34:24,255 --> 01:34:26,677
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm driving this car, turning it around.

1157
01:34:27,177 --> 01:34:32,499
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh yeah, I was going to get to the cage match pretty soon here because I know we want to do a cage match.

1158
01:34:32,779 --> 01:34:33,660
[SPEAKER_15]: You have a song, right?

1159
01:34:33,720 --> 01:34:36,861
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, of course I have a song because I didn't win last week.

1160
01:34:36,941 --> 01:34:38,742
[SPEAKER_15]: I know, just making sure because I hadn't seen it yet.

1161
01:34:39,143 --> 01:34:40,383
[SPEAKER_15]: Just making sure you had a song somewhere.

1162
01:34:41,163 --> 01:34:42,064
[SPEAKER_15]: Alright, um...

1163
01:34:44,733 --> 01:34:48,074
[SPEAKER_15]: I want to mention this really quick though, which I think, oh, two things I want to mention real quick.

1164
01:34:48,154 --> 01:34:55,116
[SPEAKER_15]: Somebody brought it up in the chat room during break and I was talking about energies at the top of the show, or energies, energy drinks at the top of the show.

1165
01:34:57,056 --> 01:35:01,478
[SPEAKER_15]: And somebody in chat reminded us about the Final Fantasy energy drink that's coming out called Potion.

1166
01:35:01,558 --> 01:35:02,158
[SPEAKER_15]: Have you heard of this?

1167
01:35:03,259 --> 01:35:04,982
[SPEAKER_15]: I swear to God I'm not making this shit up.

1168
01:35:05,283 --> 01:35:08,809
[SPEAKER_15]: There's this new energy drink coming out called... Wait, somebody give me a web link.

1169
01:35:08,870 --> 01:35:10,513
[SPEAKER_15]: I read about this on the... It should be Hypotion.

1170
01:35:10,713 --> 01:35:11,354
[SPEAKER_15]: Internet.

1171
01:35:12,597 --> 01:35:14,220
[SPEAKER_15]: Hypotion will be the one that's like...

1172
01:35:16,075 --> 01:35:16,435
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't know.

1173
01:35:17,035 --> 01:35:17,716
[SPEAKER_15]: Diet or something.

1174
01:35:17,736 --> 01:35:18,036
[SPEAKER_15]: We'll see.

1175
01:35:19,316 --> 01:35:20,076
[SPEAKER_15]: I want an ether.

1176
01:35:20,096 --> 01:35:21,517
[SPEAKER_05]: I want Phoenix down.

1177
01:35:23,458 --> 01:35:23,858
[SPEAKER_15]: Let's see.

1178
01:35:25,218 --> 01:35:25,538
[SPEAKER_15]: There it is.

1179
01:35:25,638 --> 01:35:28,399
[SPEAKER_15]: Final Fantasy XII Potion.

1180
01:35:28,960 --> 01:35:29,820
[SPEAKER_15]: And this is what it is.

1181
01:35:30,220 --> 01:35:31,420
[SPEAKER_15]: It's a food tie-in there.

1182
01:35:32,021 --> 01:35:33,501
[SPEAKER_15]: And we're looking at it there.

1183
01:35:33,581 --> 01:35:36,522
[SPEAKER_15]: Is this on... Oh, it's on Gamebrink.com is what it is here.

1184
01:35:38,063 --> 01:35:39,963
[SPEAKER_15]: It's some type of tie-in to Final Fantasy XII here.

1185
01:35:40,023 --> 01:35:41,404
[SPEAKER_15]: I wish I could zoom in on the product.

1186
01:35:41,724 --> 01:35:44,185
[SPEAKER_15]: It looks an awful lot like balls or Powerade.

1187
01:35:44,585 --> 01:35:48,187
[SPEAKER_15]: But actually I like the play on it because it looks like it's actually in a potion or something.

1188
01:35:49,748 --> 01:35:52,070
[SPEAKER_15]: March 2006 is when this stuff goes on sale.

1189
01:35:52,410 --> 01:35:57,393
[SPEAKER_15]: The drink supposedly makes you relax like herb tea and tastes mystical.

1190
01:35:57,934 --> 01:36:04,338
[SPEAKER_15]: It contains nutritional supplements so that the company can claim the drinker might recover real life hit points.

1191
01:36:07,720 --> 01:36:09,721
[SPEAKER_15]: And if you drink this, you're a nerd.

1192
01:36:10,041 --> 01:36:11,262
[SPEAKER_15]: A really big nerd.

1193
01:36:13,103 --> 01:36:13,484
[SPEAKER_15]: Just kidding.

1194
01:36:19,329 --> 01:36:19,789
[SPEAKER_15]: What can you do?

1195
01:36:20,510 --> 01:36:21,651
[SPEAKER_15]: Will I go up a level?

1196
01:36:21,811 --> 01:36:23,672
[SPEAKER_15]: What was the other thing I wanted to do?

1197
01:36:23,692 --> 01:36:24,753
[SPEAKER_15]: Will I do the little dance?

1198
01:36:24,853 --> 01:36:25,934
[SPEAKER_15]: The little throw my arms up?

1199
01:36:27,715 --> 01:36:29,217
[SPEAKER_15]: Have you played the Final Fantasy XII demo?

1200
01:36:29,437 --> 01:36:30,217
[SPEAKER_05]: I like the bottles.

1201
01:36:30,798 --> 01:36:32,199
[SPEAKER_15]: Wait, have you played the Final Fantasy XII demo?

1202
01:36:32,939 --> 01:36:34,521
[SPEAKER_05]: No, and I'm not going to because I played it.

1203
01:36:34,601 --> 01:36:35,381
[SPEAKER_15]: It's sexy.

1204
01:36:36,322 --> 01:36:37,443
[SPEAKER_15]: It's different than the E3 one.

1205
01:36:37,563 --> 01:36:38,143
[SPEAKER_15]: It's way different.

1206
01:36:38,424 --> 01:36:40,625
[SPEAKER_05]: Not from what everybody in the universe else has told me.

1207
01:36:40,665 --> 01:36:41,606
[SPEAKER_15]: No, they're lying.

1208
01:36:41,886 --> 01:36:42,226
[SPEAKER_15]: All of them.

1209
01:36:43,434 --> 01:36:45,816
[SPEAKER_05]: I love these bottles, they're cool.

1210
01:36:45,876 --> 01:36:46,857
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll get it just for the bottles.

1211
01:36:48,038 --> 01:36:48,838
[SPEAKER_15]: What else did I want to mention?

1212
01:36:48,878 --> 01:36:50,640
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh yes, Final Fantasy.

1213
01:36:52,441 --> 01:36:55,764
[SPEAKER_15]: On the cell phones, you guys pretty soon are going to be able to play DDR.

1214
01:36:56,024 --> 01:37:09,354
[SPEAKER_15]: Why you would want to play DDR on your cell phone is beyond me, but they were showing this supposedly at the Game Festival, and I completely forgot to ask Mel about this because he was there, but he probably wasn't even looking for it because my god, who gives a shit about mobile gaming?

1215
01:37:09,394 --> 01:37:09,975
[SPEAKER_15]: I know I don't.

1216
01:37:11,496 --> 01:37:11,716
[SPEAKER_15]: But...

1217
01:37:12,917 --> 01:37:15,318
[SPEAKER_15]: We actually ran a story about this on OrangeLaunchRadio.com.

1218
01:37:15,699 --> 01:37:29,946
[SPEAKER_15]: This part of it is kind of old news that you can buy the mobile ringtones that feature DDR songs, but what may be kind of news to you is that they did show in the Games on the Go area at the Game Festival that they will be doing DDR on mobile phones.

1219
01:37:30,446 --> 01:37:35,229
[SPEAKER_15]: This is probably just a port of what we've seen happen in Japan, because I believe they already have this in Japan.

1220
01:37:36,409 --> 01:37:39,371
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, a couple, and they have like Max 300 I've seen.

1221
01:37:40,251 --> 01:37:41,592
[SPEAKER_15]: Ooh, you got a bigger picture.

1222
01:37:43,291 --> 01:37:44,312
[SPEAKER_15]: That looks interesting.

1223
01:37:45,073 --> 01:37:46,656
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, sorry, Jamie was showing me the potions.

1224
01:37:48,098 --> 01:37:48,959
[SPEAKER_15]: So yeah, what can I say?

1225
01:37:48,999 --> 01:37:52,864
[SPEAKER_15]: It's DDR on the cell phone, but funny enough, the screenshot I saw was Max 300.

1226
01:37:53,685 --> 01:37:56,068
[SPEAKER_15]: And why you would want to play that on a cell phone, I have no idea.

1227
01:37:56,890 --> 01:37:58,452
[SPEAKER_15]: Especially if there's no dance pad hookup.

1228
01:37:58,792 --> 01:38:00,373
[SPEAKER_05]: That's like an exercise in futility.

1229
01:38:00,673 --> 01:38:02,995
[SPEAKER_15]: Even if there was a dance pad hookup, that would be stupid.

1230
01:38:03,715 --> 01:38:11,081
[SPEAKER_15]: The only use I would see for this is if you are a freestyler who needs your steps on the go.

1231
01:38:12,682 --> 01:38:20,527
[SPEAKER_15]: Like if you're going to be in an upcoming tournament or something, you need to take a quick look at those steps before you go up on stage, like one more time, run through the routine in your mind.

1232
01:38:20,947 --> 01:38:22,969
[SPEAKER_15]: That's where DDR on the cell phone would be a good idea.

1233
01:38:23,289 --> 01:38:23,949
[SPEAKER_15]: The rest of this?

1234
01:38:24,270 --> 01:38:24,590
[SPEAKER_15]: Crap.

1235
01:38:27,304 --> 01:38:27,785
[SPEAKER_15]: But whatever.

1236
01:38:28,806 --> 01:38:30,747
[SPEAKER_15]: I'll probably buy it anyway because I'm a consumer whore.

1237
01:38:31,248 --> 01:38:31,628
[SPEAKER_15]: Honestly.

1238
01:38:34,351 --> 01:38:36,693
[SPEAKER_15]: Jamie's showing me the bigger pictures of potion.

1239
01:38:37,074 --> 01:38:37,854
[SPEAKER_15]: That looks very nice.

1240
01:38:39,096 --> 01:38:39,576
[SPEAKER_15]: Looks pretty.

1241
01:38:39,716 --> 01:38:40,257
[SPEAKER_15]: Pretty bottles.

1242
01:38:40,897 --> 01:38:44,361
[SPEAKER_15]: I would rather buy a lot of Final Fantasy potion than DDR on the cell phone.

1243
01:38:44,381 --> 01:38:44,861
[SPEAKER_15]: That's for sure.

1244
01:38:49,526 --> 01:38:49,746
[SPEAKER_15]: Anywho.

1245
01:38:51,601 --> 01:38:53,221
[SPEAKER_15]: Let's do tonight's cage match, shall we?

1246
01:38:53,682 --> 01:38:56,882
[SPEAKER_15]: It's where we put three songs and battle against each other to the death.

1247
01:38:57,723 --> 01:38:59,483
[SPEAKER_15]: And there are fatalities involved.

1248
01:39:00,183 --> 01:39:01,984
[SPEAKER_15]: And one song emerges as the victor.

1249
01:39:02,324 --> 01:39:06,005
[SPEAKER_15]: And you guys in chat have the final say on which one of these songs is the winner.

1250
01:39:06,025 --> 01:39:08,926
[SPEAKER_15]: The winning song, by the way, goes in a rotation all week long.

1251
01:39:09,326 --> 01:39:13,027
[SPEAKER_15]: All freaking week long on Orange Lounge Radio's Bomani and Video Game Music program.

1252
01:39:13,387 --> 01:39:14,007
[SPEAKER_15]: Which is awesome.

1253
01:39:14,947 --> 01:39:16,468
[SPEAKER_15]: So let's get it started, shall we?

1254
01:39:17,088 --> 01:39:17,408
[SPEAKER_05]: Sure.

1255
01:39:20,126 --> 01:39:25,988
[SPEAKER_15]: Last week in the Orange Lounge Radio Cage Match, an old friend band of Jamie's made it.

1256
01:39:26,669 --> 01:39:28,349
[SPEAKER_15]: A friendly old band, a jolly old time.

1257
01:39:28,650 --> 01:39:32,151
[SPEAKER_15]: Blur was the band, and the song was called Crazy Beat.

1258
01:39:32,871 --> 01:39:35,893
[SPEAKER_15]: Is it crazy enough to win for a second week in a row?

1259
01:39:36,553 --> 01:39:37,373
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't know, we'll see.

1260
01:39:39,194 --> 01:39:44,616
[SPEAKER_15]: So we're going to play a clip for you guys, so you can judge if you liked us or not, and wanted to win for the second week in a row.

1261
01:39:45,116 --> 01:39:48,498
[SPEAKER_15]: So here it is, song one in tonight's Cage Match, Blur with Crazy Beat.

1262
01:39:48,618 --> 01:39:48,878
[SPEAKER_15]: Enjoy.

1263
01:40:01,378 --> 01:40:04,379
I love my brothers on Saturday night

1264
01:40:45,459 --> 01:40:55,068
[SPEAKER_09]: I love my sister and I love her tonight Break out!

1265
01:41:25,104 --> 01:41:28,427
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

1266
01:41:57,113 --> 01:42:01,576
[SPEAKER_15]: Song numero uno in tonight's cage match, Blur with Crazy Beats.

1267
01:42:01,596 --> 01:42:05,439
[SPEAKER_15]: You only get a clip of that, though, because if you wanted to hear the whole thing, you should have been listening last week.

1268
01:42:05,759 --> 01:42:06,580
[SPEAKER_15]: Honestly, kids.

1269
01:42:07,080 --> 01:42:10,943
[SPEAKER_15]: Alright, song number two in tonight's cage match comes to us via the Loki.

1270
01:42:11,023 --> 01:42:13,505
[SPEAKER_15]: Loki, what did you pick for us tonight, sir?

1271
01:42:14,926 --> 01:42:19,149
[SPEAKER_14]: Um, picked something from Alien 316, which is interesting.

1272
01:42:19,749 --> 01:42:24,413
[SPEAKER_14]: Um, see, they should have been Alien 314, because then they could have been Alien Pie.

1273
01:42:25,694 --> 01:42:26,094
[SPEAKER_14]: Ha ha ha.

1274
01:42:26,798 --> 01:42:27,198
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm lame.

1275
01:42:27,618 --> 01:42:27,918
[SPEAKER_15]: Shut up.

1276
01:42:28,338 --> 01:42:37,741
[SPEAKER_14]: Anyways, um, yeah, so this is a song from Alien 316, which you might remember from Ultramix 1 with C-Square, or was it, wait, Ultramix 2.

1277
01:42:38,581 --> 01:42:39,141
[SPEAKER_14]: I take that back.

1278
01:42:39,321 --> 01:42:40,222
[SPEAKER_14]: By the way, it's Alien 613.

1279
01:42:40,482 --> 01:42:41,662
[SPEAKER_14]: 613, whatever.

1280
01:42:41,682 --> 01:42:42,162
[SPEAKER_14]: 313, whatever.

1281
01:42:42,182 --> 01:42:44,423
[SPEAKER_14]: Who gives a crap?

1282
01:42:44,823 --> 01:42:45,743
[SPEAKER_14]: Alien and some number.

1283
01:42:46,303 --> 01:42:48,624
[SPEAKER_14]: Anyways, uh, this is the song All For Nothing.

1284
01:42:49,924 --> 01:42:50,204
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright.

1285
01:42:51,085 --> 01:42:54,566
[SPEAKER_15]: Alien number 613 with All For Nothing.

1286
01:42:54,626 --> 01:42:55,546
[SPEAKER_15]: Enjoy song number 2.

1287
01:46:42,773 --> 01:46:44,634
[SPEAKER_15]: DarkSakura, was that a number 10 or a number 2?

1288
01:46:44,774 --> 01:46:47,416
[SPEAKER_15]: Um, it was more like a number 5.

1289
01:46:47,616 --> 01:46:47,756
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay.

1290
01:46:47,856 --> 01:46:48,597
[SPEAKER_15]: Just cause...

1291
01:47:06,448 --> 01:47:36,203
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, it was cool, but it didn't really do anything, just repeated the same little lick over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over

1292
01:47:36,955 --> 01:47:37,696
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know, whatever.

1293
01:47:38,097 --> 01:47:42,062
[SPEAKER_14]: I really had nothing this week that I hadn't already picked.

1294
01:47:42,443 --> 01:47:44,987
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, I thought that song was pretty good for me to poop on.

1295
01:47:45,728 --> 01:47:46,449
[SPEAKER_13]: I'll give it a 4.

1296
01:47:48,154 --> 01:47:50,695
[SPEAKER_13]: Alright, let's move on to song number three.

1297
01:47:50,775 --> 01:47:52,636
[SPEAKER_15]: Song number three tonight is my pick.

1298
01:47:54,537 --> 01:47:57,739
[SPEAKER_15]: And I also picked a former Bomani artist because I like this song.

1299
01:47:57,799 --> 01:47:58,619
[SPEAKER_15]: It's pretty.

1300
01:47:59,400 --> 01:48:02,081
[SPEAKER_15]: It's actually a song that she actually released in the U.S.

1301
01:48:02,861 --> 01:48:03,562
[SPEAKER_15]: It's Tess.

1302
01:48:04,382 --> 01:48:08,064
[SPEAKER_15]: And the song is called The Second You Sleep, I Stay to Watch You Fade Away.

1303
01:48:08,524 --> 01:48:12,326
[SPEAKER_15]: And Tess, of course, did Justify My Love and all that stuff for DDR.

1304
01:48:12,906 --> 01:48:16,148
[SPEAKER_15]: So here it is, Tess, here on Orange Lounge Radio, song number three.

1305
01:48:25,267 --> 01:48:31,683
[SPEAKER_08]: by your side you close the door so

1306
01:50:50,733 --> 01:51:04,464
Hey, I say to watch you fade away, I dream of you tonight, tomorrow you're gone

1307
01:51:38,680 --> 01:51:42,052
[SPEAKER_08]: I wish by God you'd say

1308
01:51:53,669 --> 01:51:58,953
[SPEAKER_15]: Song number three in tonight's cage match, Tess, with The Second You Sleep by Stay to Watch You Fade Away.

1309
01:52:00,574 --> 01:52:03,936
[SPEAKER_15]: Would you like to stay to watch that song, or would you like it to fade away?

1310
01:52:04,697 --> 01:52:05,017
[SPEAKER_15]: Jamie?

1311
01:52:05,818 --> 01:52:06,438
[SPEAKER_05]: Fade, please.

1312
01:52:06,478 --> 01:52:07,179
[SPEAKER_05]: Generic Trance.

1313
01:52:07,739 --> 01:52:11,522
[SPEAKER_05]: Although that one was not as annoying as the usual one, so it gives a seven.

1314
01:52:12,142 --> 01:52:12,503
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.

1315
01:52:13,623 --> 01:52:13,884
[SPEAKER_14]: Loki?

1316
01:52:14,724 --> 01:52:16,525
[SPEAKER_14]: I'd like to know how you can watch music.

1317
01:52:18,887 --> 01:52:19,588
[SPEAKER_14]: Shut up and rate it.

1318
01:52:21,889 --> 01:52:22,610
[SPEAKER_14]: It gives a seven.

1319
01:52:24,491 --> 01:52:26,892
[SPEAKER_15]: and I'll rate that too because everybody else is kind of in and out.

1320
01:52:27,892 --> 01:52:29,032
[SPEAKER_15]: I will rate that song.

1321
01:52:29,392 --> 01:52:31,113
[SPEAKER_15]: I like the melody in that song.

1322
01:52:31,153 --> 01:52:38,675
[SPEAKER_15]: I think that's what sets it apart from other blah trance songs is I like the melody an awful lot in that song and the harmony and everything is great.

1323
01:52:38,735 --> 01:52:40,515
[SPEAKER_15]: So I give that song a nine because I like it.

1324
01:52:41,115 --> 01:52:41,396
[SPEAKER_15]: All right.

1325
01:52:42,316 --> 01:52:46,297
[SPEAKER_15]: Let us recap, shall we, the three songs you can vote for tonight in tonight's cage match.

1326
01:52:46,317 --> 01:52:50,658
[SPEAKER_15]: You can either vote for last week's winner, song number one, Blur with Crazy Beat.

1327
01:52:53,771 --> 01:53:02,557
[SPEAKER_15]: Or you can vote for song number two, Alien number 613 with All For Nothing.

1328
01:53:12,683 --> 01:53:18,087
[SPEAKER_15]: And song number three you can vote for tonight is The Second You Sleep by Stay To Watch You Fade Away by Tess.

1329
01:53:28,459 --> 01:53:30,739
[SPEAKER_15]: Place vote now.

1330
01:53:30,839 --> 01:53:36,821
[SPEAKER_15]: Send a private message to Sky in the chat room with your vote for song numero uno, dos, or tres.

1331
01:53:38,041 --> 01:53:41,302
[SPEAKER_15]: And we will see which song emerges victorious.

1332
01:53:43,762 --> 01:53:52,284
[SPEAKER_15]: This is the part of the show where I go over to Loki and I say, Hey, Loki, you know that Sim scene that's out there where people are playing Beatmania on their PSPs and shit?

1333
01:53:52,644 --> 01:53:54,104
[SPEAKER_15]: What is going on in the Sim scene?

1334
01:53:54,124 --> 01:53:56,365
[SPEAKER_15]: Because I could care less, but I know our listeners want to know.

1335
01:53:56,465 --> 01:53:57,305
[SPEAKER_15]: So, Loki, what's up?

1336
01:53:58,039 --> 01:54:10,083
[SPEAKER_14]: Um, just more stuff with DDR, um, OSC4, they are now in their In The Groove division, and they have the results for the keyboard, um, division of sim files out there.

1337
01:54:10,303 --> 01:54:15,945
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know what the difference would be with In The Groove sim files, I guess that's not quite impossible, but pretty impossible?

1338
01:54:16,525 --> 01:54:16,905
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know.

1339
01:54:18,717 --> 01:54:30,583
[SPEAKER_14]: But anyways, if anyone cares, I will go into the results here of who won the keyboard section, which I don't even really, I haven't checked out any of the entries, so God knows.

1340
01:54:31,524 --> 01:54:32,384
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, and it doesn't exist.

1341
01:54:32,444 --> 01:54:37,747
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, anyways, in other... That's one of those Bomani-style bug things, like you can't log in on the forums or...

1342
01:54:38,487 --> 01:54:39,828
[SPEAKER_15]: PoopTow, it's weird.

1343
01:54:39,948 --> 01:54:41,229
[SPEAKER_15]: Anyways, who cares?

1344
01:54:41,249 --> 01:54:43,050
[SPEAKER_15]: I have a secret account on Bobani Style.

1345
01:54:43,090 --> 01:54:49,134
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm not actually Sky, because somehow I got locked out of that account, like I can't get in it or access it at all, so I have a secret name.

1346
01:54:49,454 --> 01:54:49,754
Secret.

1347
01:54:50,194 --> 01:54:50,655
[SPEAKER_03]: Secret.

1348
01:54:51,415 --> 01:54:58,760
[SPEAKER_14]: Anyways, on top of that, the other thing was all the sim files for Ultramix 3 have been released.

1349
01:55:00,781 --> 01:55:01,161
[SPEAKER_14]: All of them.

1350
01:55:01,381 --> 01:55:04,303
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh good, that means all the MP3s are out there, so people can stop whining for them.

1351
01:55:04,628 --> 01:55:05,549
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, they are.

1352
01:55:05,949 --> 01:55:06,309
[SPEAKER_14]: I have them.

1353
01:55:07,370 --> 01:55:08,791
[SPEAKER_14]: But no, they're up there.

1354
01:55:08,811 --> 01:55:11,112
[SPEAKER_14]: You can find them at BomaniISO.com.

1355
01:55:11,132 --> 01:55:12,073
[SPEAKER_14]: I think that's what it was.

1356
01:55:12,213 --> 01:55:16,736
[SPEAKER_14]: Whatever that BitTorrent tracker was that has all the stuff that people steal and stuff.

1357
01:55:18,778 --> 01:55:19,078
[SPEAKER_14]: Yay.

1358
01:55:22,620 --> 01:55:22,901
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know.

1359
01:55:24,061 --> 01:55:25,062
[SPEAKER_14]: That's all that's going on, really.

1360
01:55:25,702 --> 01:55:25,963
[SPEAKER_15]: Dead.

1361
01:55:26,443 --> 01:55:26,723
[SPEAKER_15]: All right.

1362
01:55:26,743 --> 01:55:27,544
[SPEAKER_15]: Nothing going on.

1363
01:55:27,564 --> 01:55:28,124
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, it's Christmas.

1364
01:55:28,184 --> 01:55:32,207
[SPEAKER_15]: Everybody's taking a break from the sim scene because they're bored.

1365
01:55:32,567 --> 01:55:32,747
[SPEAKER_15]: What?

1366
01:55:32,987 --> 01:55:33,368
[SPEAKER_14]: However...

1367
01:55:34,676 --> 01:55:44,521
[SPEAKER_14]: We do have to, in a typical fashion, it is time to see how many really bad Max remixes have been released this week.

1368
01:55:46,122 --> 01:55:49,383
[SPEAKER_14]: Anyways, so starting off.

1369
01:55:49,603 --> 01:55:56,727
[SPEAKER_14]: And of course, if you guys were looking for those 2DX distorted clips, you can actually find them in their media shop.

1370
01:55:56,747 --> 01:56:00,128
[SPEAKER_14]: They have four different videos on there, so you can check those out.

1371
01:56:01,429 --> 01:56:01,669
[SPEAKER_14]: But,

1372
01:56:02,366 --> 01:56:09,888
[SPEAKER_14]: If you really want to check out what everybody is looking for, and that's really horrible Max remixes, you can also check those out in their sim file form there.

1373
01:56:10,788 --> 01:56:15,269
[SPEAKER_14]: And let's see, for this week, looks like it's been a pretty light week actually.

1374
01:56:15,629 --> 01:56:24,151
[SPEAKER_14]: We've got Max Max, Max Stink, Max 340, Max Wizard, Max Attack.

1375
01:56:24,991 --> 01:56:25,291
[SPEAKER_14]: Twice.

1376
01:56:25,391 --> 01:56:26,371
[SPEAKER_14]: Max My Butt.

1377
01:56:28,912 --> 01:56:29,072
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.

1378
01:56:30,470 --> 01:56:31,030
[SPEAKER_14]: That would be it.

1379
01:56:32,411 --> 01:56:33,951
[SPEAKER_05]: And Paranoia Fart Mix.

1380
01:56:36,152 --> 01:56:36,512
[SPEAKER_14]: Not yet.

1381
01:56:36,792 --> 01:56:38,412
[SPEAKER_14]: I didn't check and see how many Paranoia remixes there are.

1382
01:56:38,432 --> 01:56:40,193
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm still waiting for the Safari Trans Mix.

1383
01:56:42,133 --> 01:56:42,894
[SPEAKER_14]: Keep waiting.

1384
01:56:43,454 --> 01:56:46,215
[SPEAKER_14]: You'll get your Safari Trans Mix before I'll get my Xbox 360.

1385
01:56:46,255 --> 01:56:46,475
[SPEAKER_14]: Anyways.

1386
01:56:54,612 --> 01:56:58,153
[SPEAKER_15]: I'd fill time, but I'm tallying cage match votes, so it's up to you guys.

1387
01:56:59,573 --> 01:57:21,262
[SPEAKER_14]: And of course, you know, to cover the wonderful Paranoia remixes, we have Paranoia Survivor Another, Paranoia Trickmaster Edit, Paranoia Survivor Max 580, Paranoia Sky, Paranoia Agent Theme, that one I'm kind of interested to see what that is, Paranoia Eternal Freeze, Paranoia Zombie, Rotelda Paranoia,

1388
01:57:23,410 --> 01:57:23,650
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.

1389
01:57:24,952 --> 01:57:25,153
[SPEAKER_14]: Nice.

1390
01:57:25,173 --> 01:57:27,556
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know.

1391
01:57:27,616 --> 01:57:27,957
[SPEAKER_14]: It's lame.

1392
01:57:29,887 --> 01:57:37,732
[SPEAKER_15]: I want Max the final, and then I want Konami to threaten to sue anyone who puts out another Max remix, and so people can't do it anymore.

1393
01:57:39,133 --> 01:57:40,914
[SPEAKER_15]: Because I just, I'm sick of Max remixes, I really am.

1394
01:57:40,934 --> 01:57:42,455
[SPEAKER_14]: It's Maximizer now, don't you know?

1395
01:57:42,755 --> 01:57:43,176
[SPEAKER_15]: Whatever.

1396
01:57:44,236 --> 01:57:45,077
[SPEAKER_15]: Fuck Maximizer.

1397
01:57:45,197 --> 01:57:47,578
[SPEAKER_14]: Maximizer wasn't even a freaking Max remix at all.

1398
01:57:47,799 --> 01:57:53,742
[SPEAKER_15]: Fuck Maximizer, fuck Joni and Spesh Max, Super Max, Max My Ass, whatever that is.

1399
01:57:54,423 --> 01:57:57,525
[SPEAKER_15]: Fuck Max, fuck Legend of Max, seriously.

1400
01:57:58,247 --> 01:58:00,608
[SPEAKER_14]: They should make one called Extremer.

1401
01:58:01,369 --> 01:58:02,490
[SPEAKER_15]: What was the middle one?

1402
01:58:02,530 --> 01:58:04,411
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't even remember what the real ones are called anymore.

1403
01:58:04,691 --> 01:58:07,472
[SPEAKER_15]: Max Unlimited.

1404
01:58:07,532 --> 01:58:09,133
[SPEAKER_15]: Max Unlimited should have been where it stopped.

1405
01:58:09,253 --> 01:58:10,314
[SPEAKER_15]: That should have been the last one.

1406
01:58:11,134 --> 01:58:13,796
[SPEAKER_14]: Now, The Legend of Max was a good place to stop it.

1407
01:58:14,076 --> 01:58:14,796
[SPEAKER_14]: Because that was cool.

1408
01:58:14,836 --> 01:58:16,798
[SPEAKER_14]: It was kind of a song to wrap it up.

1409
01:58:16,838 --> 01:58:20,219
[SPEAKER_14]: Paranoia, like Paranoia Respect, that was a good one to end it on.

1410
01:58:20,420 --> 01:58:21,260
[SPEAKER_09]: That should be it.

1411
01:58:21,440 --> 01:58:21,820
[SPEAKER_09]: They're done.

1412
01:58:23,881 --> 01:58:24,762
[SPEAKER_14]: And same with B4U.

1413
01:58:24,822 --> 01:58:28,843
[SPEAKER_14]: B4U was a good point to stop those remixes as well.

1414
01:58:28,883 --> 01:58:37,065
[SPEAKER_15]: And what the fuck was that Max song that was in the Max Heart Attack one in Extreme Japan?

1415
01:58:37,085 --> 01:58:37,545
[SPEAKER_14]: Max Period.

1416
01:58:38,005 --> 01:58:39,085
[SPEAKER_15]: That was bullshit.

1417
01:58:39,186 --> 01:58:40,506
[SPEAKER_15]: That was absolute bullshit.

1418
01:58:43,267 --> 01:58:47,048
[SPEAKER_15]: Max Period makes me on my period.

1419
01:58:50,669 --> 01:58:51,009
[SPEAKER_15]: Alright.

1420
01:58:53,030 --> 01:59:03,433
[SPEAKER_15]: Anyway, we are going to go to a small break, and when we come back from this small break, we might do some more Skype calls, if you're good.

1421
01:59:04,153 --> 01:59:08,554
[SPEAKER_15]: Otherwise, we're going to do the FUs of the week, so we'll see what kind of mood we're in when we come back from this.

1422
01:59:09,214 --> 01:59:12,955
[SPEAKER_15]: But we will do both at some point, so don't get your panties in a bunch.

1423
01:59:14,795 --> 01:59:21,337
[SPEAKER_15]: In this break, in celebration of Angel's new necklace, we're going to do a couple LED songs.

1424
01:59:23,140 --> 01:59:27,321
[SPEAKER_15]: So we'll start it off with a little Love is Dreaminess, and we'll be back after this with more Orange Lounge!

1425
01:59:40,065 --> 01:59:41,225
DarkSakura

1426
01:59:53,368 --> 01:59:54,488
Thanks for watching!

1427
02:04:07,276 --> 02:04:07,897
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks for watching!

1428
02:04:39,461 --> 02:04:40,182
Thanks for watching!

1429
02:05:10,620 --> 02:05:11,237
Thank you for watching!

1430
02:05:34,309 --> 02:05:35,090
Thanks for watching!

1431
02:06:03,861 --> 02:06:06,373
[SPEAKER_08]: So much for making the world a dream come true

1432
02:06:38,032 --> 02:06:39,073
Thanks for watching!

1433
02:07:35,956 --> 02:07:42,120
[SPEAKER_15]: Gaming Radio, so uncensored that even Tom Brokaw could get a job with us.

1434
02:07:42,140 --> 02:07:43,320
[SPEAKER_15]: Orange Lounge Radio.

1435
02:07:49,767 --> 02:07:50,807
[SPEAKER_15]: Cracks me up every time.

1436
02:07:50,867 --> 02:07:52,568
[SPEAKER_15]: See, it sounds like he says tax cunts.

1437
02:07:52,848 --> 02:07:53,188
[SPEAKER_15]: Get it?

1438
02:07:55,589 --> 02:07:56,469
[SPEAKER_15]: It totally does.

1439
02:07:57,509 --> 02:07:58,950
[SPEAKER_15]: Welcome back to Orange Lawn Radio, boys and girls.

1440
02:07:59,230 --> 02:08:00,970
[SPEAKER_15]: LED in that break.

1441
02:08:01,030 --> 02:08:02,350
[SPEAKER_15]: Just nothing but LED.

1442
02:08:03,251 --> 02:08:07,052
[SPEAKER_15]: Love is dreaminess, nebula grasper, something wonderful, photogenic.

1443
02:08:07,832 --> 02:08:08,432
[SPEAKER_15]: All in that break.

1444
02:08:10,808 --> 02:08:12,371
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm being a comedic genius in the chatroom.

1445
02:08:21,050 --> 02:08:23,671
[SPEAKER_15]: And in fact, I don't know, I joined in a game here.

1446
02:08:23,751 --> 02:08:27,571
[SPEAKER_15]: Somebody just asked, oh, I'm not even going to try to pronounce his name.

1447
02:08:27,631 --> 02:08:28,992
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm totally going to butcher this.

1448
02:08:30,332 --> 02:08:33,252
[SPEAKER_15]: Milfululi, Milfululi?

1449
02:08:33,272 --> 02:08:34,973
[SPEAKER_15]: I probably fucked that up.

1450
02:08:35,373 --> 02:08:37,413
[SPEAKER_15]: Says, what's black and white and red all over?

1451
02:08:37,513 --> 02:08:39,614
[SPEAKER_15]: And everybody, you know, is putting their own answers.

1452
02:08:39,654 --> 02:08:41,234
[SPEAKER_15]: I put a zebra that I just shot.

1453
02:08:42,574 --> 02:08:44,174
[SPEAKER_15]: Rini said a nun in a blender.

1454
02:08:46,055 --> 02:08:47,135
[SPEAKER_15]: Or a sunburnt penguin.

1455
02:08:48,533 --> 02:08:51,934
[SPEAKER_15]: So everybody's a comedian these days, actually.

1456
02:08:52,395 --> 02:08:52,875
[SPEAKER_15]: What's going on?

1457
02:08:53,035 --> 02:08:54,195
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, I left the nun in a blender.

1458
02:08:54,235 --> 02:08:55,136
[SPEAKER_15]: That's pretty good.

1459
02:08:57,637 --> 02:08:57,957
[SPEAKER_15]: All right.

1460
02:08:58,337 --> 02:08:59,838
[SPEAKER_14]: Michael Jackson.

1461
02:09:00,778 --> 02:09:01,018
[SPEAKER_15]: What?

1462
02:09:01,338 --> 02:09:04,580
[SPEAKER_14]: Because he has that red costume that he wears, and it's black and white around him.

1463
02:09:07,181 --> 02:09:07,921
[SPEAKER_15]: You're hella dumb.

1464
02:09:09,902 --> 02:09:10,682
[SPEAKER_15]: You said hella.

1465
02:09:11,483 --> 02:09:11,783
[SPEAKER_09]: I did.

1466
02:09:11,883 --> 02:09:13,183
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm from Northern California.

1467
02:09:13,664 --> 02:09:14,464
[SPEAKER_15]: I have to say hella.

1468
02:09:16,161 --> 02:09:20,563
[SPEAKER_15]: I guess I might as well acknowledge the fact that the one and only LankyStyle is sitting in the room with us right now.

1469
02:09:20,603 --> 02:09:21,704
[SPEAKER_15]: How you doing, Mr. LankyStyle?

1470
02:09:22,024 --> 02:09:22,744
[SPEAKER_15]: Why'd you do that?

1471
02:09:23,045 --> 02:09:23,265
[SPEAKER_11]: Why?

1472
02:09:23,305 --> 02:09:26,386
[SPEAKER_11]: Now this show's just taken a big turn for the worse.

1473
02:09:26,406 --> 02:09:28,908
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, this show took a turn for the worse two and a half years ago.

1474
02:09:29,848 --> 02:09:34,771
[SPEAKER_15]: What, um, what's up?

1475
02:09:35,231 --> 02:09:36,071
[SPEAKER_15]: That's when Loki joined.

1476
02:09:36,532 --> 02:09:40,253
[SPEAKER_15]: I are funny.

1477
02:09:40,293 --> 02:09:42,054
[SPEAKER_15]: What kind of games have you been playing this week, my friend?

1478
02:09:42,895 --> 02:09:44,836
[SPEAKER_15]: Bring us back to talking about video games for a little bit.

1479
02:09:45,256 --> 02:09:46,838
[SPEAKER_11]: Dragon Quest VIII

1480
02:10:00,871 --> 02:10:13,518
[SPEAKER_15]: Because I love the, everybody knows I love the Dragon Quest series, but... That's funny, those are the exact same two games I've been playing, except a lot more Dragon Quest VIII, and when I have time, I'm actually like five hours into Dragon Quest VIII, and for me, that's a long time to be sitting with a game.

1481
02:10:13,658 --> 02:10:13,938
[SPEAKER_15]: Exactly.

1482
02:10:13,958 --> 02:10:14,418
[SPEAKER_15]: Seriously.

1483
02:10:14,899 --> 02:10:20,341
[SPEAKER_15]: Even though it's only like probably... I'm probably like not even... About 4 or 5% of the game.

1484
02:10:20,402 --> 02:10:22,923
[SPEAKER_15]: I haven't even scratched the surface of that game, I know I haven't.

1485
02:10:23,343 --> 02:10:23,923
[SPEAKER_15]: And that's fine.

1486
02:10:24,524 --> 02:10:25,504
[SPEAKER_15]: At least I'm getting my money's worth.

1487
02:10:25,824 --> 02:10:30,267
[SPEAKER_15]: But I know that I will probably completely ignore Dragon Quest this week when Animal Crossing comes out.

1488
02:10:30,367 --> 02:10:30,927
[SPEAKER_11]: That's true.

1489
02:10:31,428 --> 02:10:32,108
[SPEAKER_11]: Animal Crossing.

1490
02:10:32,668 --> 02:10:34,229
[SPEAKER_11]: That is looking pretty good.

1491
02:10:34,369 --> 02:10:38,792
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, I haven't been doing a lot of reading on the features, but I mean... Who gives a shit?

1492
02:10:38,832 --> 02:10:40,613
[SPEAKER_15]: I know it has the online... Who gives a shit?

1493
02:10:40,653 --> 02:10:42,614
[SPEAKER_15]: It's online, it's Animal Crossing, and I get a bug net.

1494
02:10:43,894 --> 02:10:48,677
[SPEAKER_11]: But I'm wondering if it's going to be fresh enough to keep me into it longer than I was the original.

1495
02:10:49,818 --> 02:10:51,919
[SPEAKER_15]: Everybody else stayed on it for... Internet, me, me...

1496
02:10:52,833 --> 02:10:53,913
[SPEAKER_11]: Man, that's true.

1497
02:10:55,494 --> 02:10:56,434
[SPEAKER_15]: You know, that would be great.

1498
02:10:56,514 --> 02:11:06,698
[SPEAKER_15]: I think in Animal Crossing, there should be a day called I Kill Every One Day, and I go and I shoot the people I don't like in the village and then cook them for dinner.

1499
02:11:08,559 --> 02:11:11,400
[SPEAKER_15]: That would be the greatest Animal Crossing day ever.

1500
02:11:11,700 --> 02:11:16,122
[SPEAKER_11]: You get the, like, come here, Olivia, razor-wired bug net.

1501
02:11:17,182 --> 02:11:18,443
[SPEAKER_11]: You get to hit them over the head with.

1502
02:11:19,975 --> 02:11:25,280
[SPEAKER_11]: It's Battle Royale Day on Animal Crossing.

1503
02:11:25,380 --> 02:11:26,661
[SPEAKER_05]: I told my foo-poo joke.

1504
02:11:27,101 --> 02:11:28,763
[SPEAKER_15]: What's this, dare I ask?

1505
02:11:28,983 --> 02:11:29,704
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, I'll repeat it.

1506
02:11:30,344 --> 02:11:33,727
[SPEAKER_15]: How dare you interrupt my Animal Crossing rant, by the way.

1507
02:11:33,807 --> 02:11:36,069
[SPEAKER_15]: You will be in the Animal Battle Royale.

1508
02:11:37,310 --> 02:11:39,772
[SPEAKER_05]: My Animal Crossing has been pre-ordered already.

1509
02:11:40,573 --> 02:11:41,374
[SPEAKER_15]: Alright, what's the joke?

1510
02:11:41,654 --> 02:11:43,916
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, I'm going to have to retell it.

1511
02:11:45,376 --> 02:11:48,618
[SPEAKER_05]: These explorers, there's a legend of a bird called the Foo Poo Bird.

1512
02:11:48,938 --> 02:11:49,998
[SPEAKER_05]: I've told you this one before.

1513
02:11:50,839 --> 02:11:51,259
[SPEAKER_04]: I think so.

1514
02:11:51,879 --> 02:11:55,761
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, the legend is that anyone who goes after the Foo Poo Bird disappears.

1515
02:11:56,441 --> 02:11:58,162
[SPEAKER_05]: So three explorers decide they're going to find it.

1516
02:11:58,342 --> 02:12:00,003
[SPEAKER_05]: One goes one way and two go off the other way.

1517
02:12:00,803 --> 02:12:08,827
[SPEAKER_05]: And so the one who's by himself, he hears this, and then he finds he's got poo on his head, so he wipes it off.

1518
02:12:09,367 --> 02:12:10,128
[SPEAKER_05]: And he vanishes.

1519
02:12:11,228 --> 02:12:14,310
[SPEAKER_05]: So the other two are together, and all of a sudden they hear, Roar!

1520
02:12:15,856 --> 02:12:18,158
[SPEAKER_05]: and one of them looks up in time to get shot on in the face.

1521
02:12:18,798 --> 02:12:19,559
[SPEAKER_05]: So he wipes it off.

1522
02:12:19,579 --> 02:12:20,139
[SPEAKER_06]: That's no fun.

1523
02:12:20,339 --> 02:12:21,160
[SPEAKER_05]: And he disappears.

1524
02:12:21,940 --> 02:12:23,101
[SPEAKER_05]: And the other one's like, oh no!

1525
02:12:23,341 --> 02:12:25,483
[SPEAKER_05]: And he starts running off because he saw how it happened.

1526
02:12:26,164 --> 02:12:30,306
[SPEAKER_05]: And so right before he gets to the end of the jungle, and he's got poo on his head.

1527
02:12:30,327 --> 02:12:31,607
[SPEAKER_05]: He's like, well, crap.

1528
02:12:31,708 --> 02:12:33,549
[SPEAKER_05]: I know if I wipe this off, I'm going to disappear.

1529
02:12:34,029 --> 02:12:35,230
[SPEAKER_05]: So he goes home with shit on his head.

1530
02:12:36,171 --> 02:12:39,433
[SPEAKER_05]: And he goes home to his wife and she goes, why do you have crap on your head?

1531
02:12:39,773 --> 02:12:43,136
[SPEAKER_05]: He's like, because if you wipe off the poop of the foo-poo bird, then you'll disappear.

1532
02:12:43,716 --> 02:12:44,957
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, well, we'll live with it.

1533
02:12:45,017 --> 02:12:45,637
[SPEAKER_05]: So they go to bed.

1534
02:12:45,997 --> 02:12:48,698
[SPEAKER_05]: But the stink is so bad that she has to wipe it off of his head.

1535
02:12:49,118 --> 02:12:50,899
[SPEAKER_05]: So when she does, it disappears.

1536
02:12:50,919 --> 02:12:52,520
[SPEAKER_05]: So you know what the moral of the story is?

1537
02:12:53,740 --> 02:12:54,020
[SPEAKER_06]: What?

1538
02:12:54,341 --> 02:12:55,281
[SPEAKER_05]: If the fooshits wear it.

1539
02:13:03,865 --> 02:13:04,805
[SPEAKER_15]: Please don't quit your day job.

1540
02:13:06,646 --> 02:13:07,226
[SPEAKER_05]: I wish I could.

1541
02:13:10,149 --> 02:13:11,670
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh my god, that was so bad!

1542
02:13:11,710 --> 02:13:12,831
[SPEAKER_13]: It was so bad!

1543
02:13:13,412 --> 02:13:14,413
[SPEAKER_13]: So very bad!

1544
02:13:14,713 --> 02:13:16,214
[SPEAKER_15]: It was bad, bad, bad!

1545
02:13:16,274 --> 02:13:19,197
[SPEAKER_15]: Wow, this brings me back to World's Worst Forward.

1546
02:13:19,977 --> 02:13:25,702
[SPEAKER_15]: That makes me want to go watch Deuce Bigelow, European Gigolo, just so I can hear something funny.

1547
02:13:26,082 --> 02:13:26,403
[SPEAKER_15]: Maybe.

1548
02:13:32,207 --> 02:13:33,488
[SPEAKER_15]: Now that the show has been ruined.

1549
02:13:33,709 --> 02:13:34,009
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

1550
02:13:35,556 --> 02:13:36,257
[SPEAKER_02]: You laughed.

1551
02:13:36,277 --> 02:13:38,498
[SPEAKER_15]: Get the fooshits, Jesus Christ.

1552
02:13:39,159 --> 02:13:40,179
[SPEAKER_15]: All right.

1553
02:13:40,820 --> 02:13:43,942
[SPEAKER_15]: That is definitely an opportunity for us to go into the FUs of the week.

1554
02:13:44,342 --> 02:13:46,064
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, I told the one-eyed whore joke, too.

1555
02:13:47,525 --> 02:13:48,425
[SPEAKER_15]: The one-eyed whore joke?

1556
02:13:48,866 --> 02:13:49,246
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

1557
02:13:49,266 --> 02:13:49,586
[SPEAKER_15]: You know what?

1558
02:13:49,626 --> 02:13:52,308
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm not even going to ask.

1559
02:13:53,229 --> 02:13:55,571
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm simply going to go to the FUs of the week.

1560
02:13:55,611 --> 02:13:58,332
[SPEAKER_15]: And, Jamie, why is it that we do these FUs of the week every single week?

1561
02:14:13,236 --> 02:14:16,901
[SPEAKER_05]: The first Seth U of the week goes to Rob for not finding my joke hilarious.

1562
02:14:17,482 --> 02:14:18,864
[SPEAKER_05]: Which it was, and you know it.

1563
02:14:20,273 --> 02:14:26,699
[SPEAKER_05]: The second SU of the week goes toward certain aspects of my employment, which I am not at liberty to discuss.

1564
02:14:29,621 --> 02:14:36,167
[SPEAKER_05]: Another aspect goes toward me for not having the money that I want to have right now.

1565
02:14:37,008 --> 02:14:38,149
[SPEAKER_05]: And traffic.

1566
02:14:38,449 --> 02:14:39,831
[SPEAKER_05]: I hate traffic in this area.

1567
02:14:40,872 --> 02:14:45,456
[SPEAKER_05]: And also a humongous SU goes to superficiality.

1568
02:14:46,477 --> 02:14:46,857
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's it.

1569
02:14:48,846 --> 02:14:51,448
[SPEAKER_13]: Alright, that was, yeah I was going to say that was short.

1570
02:14:51,508 --> 02:14:54,710
[SPEAKER_05]: And having the plague, because I feel it coming upon me again.

1571
02:14:55,270 --> 02:14:55,770
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh god.

1572
02:14:57,511 --> 02:15:01,534
[SPEAKER_13]: Alright, let's go over to Loki.

1573
02:15:02,755 --> 02:15:03,075
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

1574
02:15:06,317 --> 02:15:13,581
[SPEAKER_14]: Anyways, to start off my FUs of the week, I'm actually kind of, this is not anything that has to do with me.

1575
02:15:14,042 --> 02:15:17,904
[SPEAKER_14]: My sister's house was actually broken into by some guy in broad daylight.

1576
02:15:18,243 --> 02:15:21,105
[SPEAKER_14]: Now this is how retarded this guy is, and this is kind of funny.

1577
02:15:21,865 --> 02:15:24,166
[SPEAKER_14]: The guy was breaking into the house in broad daylight.

1578
02:15:24,366 --> 02:15:26,648
[SPEAKER_14]: People observed him breaking into the house.

1579
02:15:26,768 --> 02:15:30,010
[SPEAKER_14]: First he tried the garage door and couldn't pry it open with his crowbar.

1580
02:15:30,430 --> 02:15:33,371
[SPEAKER_14]: Tried the front door, couldn't pry it open with his crowbar.

1581
02:15:33,712 --> 02:15:36,333
[SPEAKER_14]: Tried kicking in the front door, still couldn't get it.

1582
02:15:36,713 --> 02:15:38,654
[SPEAKER_14]: Tried the side door, couldn't get that.

1583
02:15:39,015 --> 02:15:41,236
[SPEAKER_14]: And if the fool shits, wear it.

1584
02:15:42,847 --> 02:15:49,651
[SPEAKER_14]: Finally, he tried breaking the bedroom window, got in through there and stole some costume jewelry and then left.

1585
02:15:51,652 --> 02:15:53,774
[SPEAKER_14]: Thereby netting absolutely nothing.

1586
02:15:56,135 --> 02:15:58,136
[SPEAKER_14]: So, fuck you, the stupid, retarded people.

1587
02:15:58,236 --> 02:16:05,861
[SPEAKER_14]: Not only that, he stopped traffic as he was running across the street to escape being caught, even though he was already seen.

1588
02:16:06,417 --> 02:16:09,518
[SPEAKER_14]: But he did get away because the cops took an hour to respond.

1589
02:16:09,658 --> 02:16:11,839
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Carmichael PD.

1590
02:16:13,360 --> 02:16:26,065
[SPEAKER_14]: Anyways, um, then, um, fuck you to Microsoft for fucking up both, not only the US launch of the 360, but now the UK launch, and I know you're gonna go for 3.

1591
02:16:27,405 --> 02:16:36,628
[SPEAKER_14]: with the Japanese launch, but too bad the Japanese don't give a shit about your system because all the wonderful games are coming out for it, like the wonderful RPGs and DOA4 and stuff.

1592
02:16:36,708 --> 02:16:38,908
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh yeah, those aren't coming out at launch because they're delayed now.

1593
02:16:38,988 --> 02:16:39,889
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you very much.

1594
02:16:40,369 --> 02:16:43,970
[SPEAKER_14]: But hey, they can play Madden because Madden rocks, I guess.

1595
02:16:45,930 --> 02:16:52,652
[SPEAKER_14]: Also, fuck you to GameStop for not getting any more shipments in of the 360.

1596
02:16:53,052 --> 02:16:55,133
[SPEAKER_14]: I know it's not their fault, but still though,

1597
02:16:55,598 --> 02:16:57,059
[SPEAKER_14]: They said I was halfway down the list.

1598
02:16:57,119 --> 02:16:57,860
[SPEAKER_14]: They lied to me.

1599
02:16:57,880 --> 02:16:59,482
[SPEAKER_14]: I was actually towards the bottom of the list.

1600
02:16:59,522 --> 02:17:02,745
[SPEAKER_14]: So fuck them for not knowing what halfway means.

1601
02:17:03,485 --> 02:17:07,409
[SPEAKER_14]: And also, fuck you to stupid people driving your cars because you can't.

1602
02:17:07,949 --> 02:17:12,433
[SPEAKER_14]: And women do not need to be driving SUVs because they're obviously too big for them to handle.

1603
02:17:16,097 --> 02:17:16,417
[SPEAKER_11]: Wow.

1604
02:17:17,017 --> 02:17:17,758
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, fuck them.

1605
02:17:19,139 --> 02:17:20,180
[SPEAKER_05]: Stupid useless vehicle.

1606
02:17:21,782 --> 02:17:22,042
[SPEAKER_11]: They could...

1607
02:17:22,421 --> 02:17:28,766
[SPEAKER_11]: They could save that Japanese Xbox 360 launch if they would just make an Arnold Schwarzenegger game.

1608
02:17:29,487 --> 02:17:31,749
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, they love Arnold Schwarzenegger in Japan.

1609
02:17:35,372 --> 02:17:36,133
[SPEAKER_08]: Go play my game!

1610
02:17:38,395 --> 02:17:39,055
[SPEAKER_08]: Do it now!

1611
02:17:41,578 --> 02:17:42,578
[SPEAKER_09]: Govenator!

1612
02:17:45,181 --> 02:17:45,921
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, I'm done.

1613
02:17:47,603 --> 02:17:50,105
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, I guess that means it's now my turn.

1614
02:17:54,726 --> 02:18:02,149
[SPEAKER_15]: Um, I would say an F you just to the fact that I've just been feeling like shit all week and I've just been doing some crazy things.

1615
02:18:02,809 --> 02:18:10,491
[SPEAKER_15]: And the fact that I've just had lack of sleep and just been overall just feeling rather blah and I don't know.

1616
02:18:11,092 --> 02:18:14,813
[SPEAKER_15]: F you to the fact that I'm just an angsty person and...

1617
02:18:16,843 --> 02:18:20,627
[SPEAKER_15]: This F you to the fact that it's Christmas time and this time of year always sucks.

1618
02:18:21,128 --> 02:18:21,789
[SPEAKER_15]: It just does.

1619
02:18:22,029 --> 02:18:28,956
[SPEAKER_15]: I hope Santa... I better not say that because the FBI will come after us and say, I hope Santa brings me a bomb for Christmas so I can blow some people up.

1620
02:18:30,158 --> 02:18:31,760
[SPEAKER_15]: But I'm not really meaning that.

1621
02:18:31,860 --> 02:18:32,340
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't mean that.

1622
02:18:32,661 --> 02:18:34,202
[SPEAKER_14]: Now, now, you don't have the turban for that.

1623
02:18:35,163 --> 02:18:36,024
[SPEAKER_15]: That is horrible.

1624
02:18:36,265 --> 02:18:36,925
[SPEAKER_15]: That is horrible.

1625
02:18:38,107 --> 02:18:38,427
[SPEAKER_15]: All right.

1626
02:18:39,867 --> 02:18:44,249
[SPEAKER_15]: Not really, I hope it's a bomb full of confetti, so I can show you my love.

1627
02:18:44,429 --> 02:18:48,391
[SPEAKER_16]: Full of wonderful radioactive confetti.

1628
02:18:50,331 --> 02:18:51,592
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm on some list now.

1629
02:18:51,612 --> 02:18:57,474
[SPEAKER_14]: You can always do what the major retailers are doing, that's just crash a float into somebody.

1630
02:18:58,635 --> 02:18:59,655
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, that sounds like fun.

1631
02:19:00,596 --> 02:19:04,117
[SPEAKER_15]: I want somebody to build me a Spongebob bomb of air.

1632
02:19:04,557 --> 02:19:04,938
[SPEAKER_15]: Hot air.

1633
02:19:04,958 --> 02:19:05,878
[SPEAKER_15]: That'd be fun.

1634
02:19:07,287 --> 02:19:09,428
[SPEAKER_05]: I think there's already enough hot air in the government.

1635
02:19:09,748 --> 02:19:10,108
[SPEAKER_15]: Alright.

1636
02:19:10,869 --> 02:19:13,290
[SPEAKER_15]: Alright, let's go to Brad.

1637
02:19:13,330 --> 02:19:16,131
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm sure Brad has some FUs that he wants to get out of his system.

1638
02:19:16,231 --> 02:19:17,051
[SPEAKER_11]: Sure, why not.

1639
02:19:17,111 --> 02:19:18,552
[SPEAKER_11]: What do you call a deer with no eyes?

1640
02:19:19,432 --> 02:19:20,053
[SPEAKER_11]: No eye-deer.

1641
02:19:20,733 --> 02:19:22,534
[SPEAKER_11]: What do you call a deer with no eyes and no legs?

1642
02:19:22,974 --> 02:19:23,794
[SPEAKER_11]: Still no eye-deer.

1643
02:19:25,135 --> 02:19:27,456
[SPEAKER_08]: There's my FUs of the week.

1644
02:19:27,936 --> 02:19:30,998
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, if we were going with corny jokes for the night, then I figured, you know.

1645
02:19:31,218 --> 02:19:32,999
[SPEAKER_11]: You are fucking lame.

1646
02:19:33,979 --> 02:19:35,219

02:19:50,578 --> 02:19:52,179
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah, it's been hella cold, what the hell?

1652
02:19:52,760 --> 02:19:59,865
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't really say that though, because people in other areas of the United States are colder, so whatever.

1653
02:20:01,006 --> 02:20:03,348
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I've been cold, so you know what, yeah, whatever.

1654
02:20:05,070 --> 02:20:05,891
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, who didn't go?

02:21:31,744 --> 02:21:33,866
[SPEAKER_15]: Not as much as a woman hitting you with her SUV.

1677
02:21:35,441 --> 02:21:43,403
[SPEAKER_15]: If you read the article that I posted on the site, you would see that I said the exact same thing.

[SPEAKER_15]: F you to Rent because it has some of the most addicting songs I've ever heard on their soundtrack.

1749
02:25:50,665 --> 02:25:55,546
[SPEAKER_15]: F you to Final Fantasy Potions because they probably will never make it over here except at anime conventions.

1750
02:25:57,107 --> 02:25:57,987
[SPEAKER_15]: Also an F you to...

1751
02:26:00,985 --> 02:26:04,826
[SPEAKER_15]: at $30 and not $20, even though they're not decent ports.

1752
02:26:07,607 --> 02:26:09,327
[SPEAKER_15]: Damn, you bitches are angsty tonight.

1753
02:26:09,368 --> 02:26:10,268
[SPEAKER_15]: That's all I have to say.

1754
02:26:10,368 --> 02:26:10,708
[SPEAKER_15]: Wow.

1755
02:26:11,328 --> 02:26:12,048
[SPEAKER_15]: Wow, wow, wow.

1756
02:26:12,148 --> 02:26:13,869
[SPEAKER_05]: The chat room has turned into bra chat.

1757
02:26:14,289 --> 02:26:14,669
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, really?

1758
02:26:15,029 --> 02:26:17,530
[SPEAKER_15]: And what kind of things have we learned about bras?

1759
02:26:18,570 --> 02:26:21,591
[SPEAKER_05]: Apparently underwear keeps you from being droopy like grandma when you're old.

1760
02:26:22,411 --> 02:26:27,052
[SPEAKER_15]: You know, I'm glad that my underwear does not have metal wires in it because that might be painful.

1761
02:26:27,432 --> 02:26:28,433
[SPEAKER_05]: Worst invention ever.

1762
02:26:29,833 --> 02:26:35,297
[SPEAKER_15]: You know, but I do recall from, you know, I used to date girls and sometimes we'd get, you know, we'd get... Shut up!

1763
02:26:35,677 --> 02:26:36,998
[SPEAKER_15]: Why is everybody laughing at that?

1764
02:26:37,838 --> 02:26:45,263
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, we used to sometimes get a little freaky and I used to... Going shopping with a girl and your girlfriend doesn't mean you're dating them.

1765
02:26:45,283 --> 02:26:45,703
[SPEAKER_15]: No, no, no.

1766
02:26:45,863 --> 02:26:50,907
[SPEAKER_15]: I actually, I used to take girls' bras off and I remember it was a pain in the ass to do.

1767
02:26:50,987 --> 02:26:54,389
[SPEAKER_15]: Like, it's... You need... That was the sign right there.

1768
02:26:54,749 --> 02:26:55,410
[SPEAKER_15]: Seriously!

1769
02:26:55,510 --> 02:26:56,670
[SPEAKER_15]: That's how I knew I was gay.

1770
02:26:56,710 --> 02:26:57,911
[SPEAKER_15]: I was like, fuck this bra shit.

1771
02:26:57,931 --> 02:26:58,952
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm just gonna suck dick.

1772
02:27:01,095 --> 02:27:04,236
[SPEAKER_15]: It's not that hard.

1773
02:27:04,476 --> 02:27:06,777
[SPEAKER_14]: It's not that hard when you figure it out.

1774
02:27:07,258 --> 02:27:08,858
[SPEAKER_14]: It's not that hard when you figure it out.

1775
02:27:10,419 --> 02:27:10,899
[SPEAKER_15]: Seriously.

1776
02:27:11,279 --> 02:27:11,719
[SPEAKER_15]: I know.

1777
02:27:12,120 --> 02:27:12,780
[SPEAKER_15]: I just, you know.

1778
02:27:12,800 --> 02:27:16,561
[SPEAKER_15]: You can get to the point where you can just look at a broad and it pops up.

1779
02:27:16,581 --> 02:27:17,402
[SPEAKER_15]: Look, I give up easy.

1780
02:27:17,602 --> 02:27:18,422
[SPEAKER_15]: I give up easy, okay?

1781
02:27:18,462 --> 02:27:18,942
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm a quitter.

1782
02:27:19,783 --> 02:27:20,863
[SPEAKER_15]: I take the lazy way out.

1783
02:27:24,045 --> 02:27:24,385
[SPEAKER_15]: Alright.

1784
02:27:25,945 --> 02:27:26,266
[SPEAKER_11]: What?

1785
02:27:26,346 --> 02:27:27,106
[SPEAKER_11]: What's so damn funny?

1786
02:27:28,408 --> 02:27:30,810
[SPEAKER_11]: Rob is more interested in putting them on than taking them off.

1787
02:27:32,371 --> 02:27:33,132
[SPEAKER_15]: No way.

1788
02:27:33,252 --> 02:27:34,834
[SPEAKER_15]: Take that both ways if you want.

1789
02:27:34,974 --> 02:27:37,376
[SPEAKER_15]: No, that is the gay stereotype I do not do, okay?

1790
02:27:40,453 --> 02:27:44,496
[SPEAKER_15]: Every gay person I know fits into some gay stereotype.

1791
02:27:44,536 --> 02:27:46,637
[SPEAKER_15]: There's some gay stereotype.

1792
02:27:46,737 --> 02:27:47,378
[SPEAKER_15]: Even Shane.

1793
02:27:47,698 --> 02:27:47,918
[SPEAKER_15]: What?

1794
02:27:48,358 --> 02:27:58,085
[SPEAKER_14]: What was that one time at the other apartment when I came back from the pool and there was people wearing bras with water balloon or condom breasts?

1795
02:27:58,125 --> 02:27:58,445
[SPEAKER_15]: Not me.

1796
02:27:58,725 --> 02:28:00,266
[SPEAKER_15]: That was my surprise birthday party.

1797
02:28:00,366 --> 02:28:02,008
[SPEAKER_15]: There was a dress involved.

1798
02:28:03,028 --> 02:28:04,549
[SPEAKER_15]: I didn't wear a bra.

1799
02:28:04,589 --> 02:28:08,192
[SPEAKER_11]: It was a bitch and hoe party and that was the whole theme.

1800
02:28:11,037 --> 02:28:13,659
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm just hoping you wasn't getting, like, hot and bothered off of it, that's all.

1801
02:28:14,039 --> 02:28:15,621
[SPEAKER_11]: No, you weren't wearing a bra.

1802
02:28:15,701 --> 02:28:16,681
[SPEAKER_11]: No, I wasn't.

1803
02:28:16,862 --> 02:28:18,503
[SPEAKER_11]: Hell no, I was the pimp of the party.

1804
02:28:18,523 --> 02:28:19,844
[SPEAKER_11]: Everybody else was the bitch and hoe.

1805
02:28:20,004 --> 02:28:20,304
[SPEAKER_11]: I see.

1806
02:28:22,966 --> 02:28:28,650
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't understand how you can, like, teach, you know, PPOs and HMOs and all that complicated crap.

1807
02:28:28,670 --> 02:28:30,191
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't talk about it!

1808
02:28:30,211 --> 02:28:33,474
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't unhook three little hooks from a bra.

1809
02:28:33,494 --> 02:28:34,274
[SPEAKER_15]: No, like, seriously?

1810
02:28:34,314 --> 02:28:36,276
[SPEAKER_15]: If the girls I used to date would have, like, the 20-hook bra?

1811
02:28:37,679 --> 02:28:40,020
[SPEAKER_15]: The 20 hook bras.

1812
02:28:40,100 --> 02:28:41,881
[SPEAKER_15]: Were they grandmas or something?

1813
02:28:42,001 --> 02:28:43,021
[SPEAKER_02]: Like you liked older women?

1814
02:28:43,041 --> 02:28:43,422
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

1815
02:28:43,462 --> 02:28:44,442
[SPEAKER_02]: Dating gorillas?

1816
02:28:44,802 --> 02:28:45,282
[SPEAKER_15]: No!

1817
02:28:46,003 --> 02:28:48,664
[SPEAKER_15]: I was dating very nice women that had bras with 20 hooks on them.

1818
02:28:48,684 --> 02:28:52,445
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know, in some respects that might not be a bad thing since that involves Damon Auburn.

1819
02:28:53,085 --> 02:28:53,726
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, stop it.

1820
02:28:54,406 --> 02:28:57,667
[SPEAKER_14]: So 20 hooks, were they monkey people or something?

1821
02:28:57,727 --> 02:28:59,988
[SPEAKER_15]: No, it was a complicated bra.

1822
02:29:02,546 --> 02:29:11,630
[SPEAKER_14]: I would like you to meet my wonderful friend... They need to make bra... You know what?

1823
02:29:12,010 --> 02:29:14,331
[SPEAKER_15]: Why don't they make... Here's a novel concept.

1824
02:29:14,571 --> 02:29:15,632
[SPEAKER_15]: Why don't they make what?

1825
02:29:16,232 --> 02:29:17,152
[SPEAKER_15]: No, no, let me finish.

1826
02:29:17,552 --> 02:29:19,713
[SPEAKER_15]: Why don't they make a bra out of Velcro?

1827
02:29:20,434 --> 02:29:21,354
[SPEAKER_15]: Wouldn't that be easy?

1828
02:29:21,754 --> 02:29:23,595
[SPEAKER_15]: Just rip, and there we go.

1829
02:29:24,015 --> 02:29:25,596
[SPEAKER_15]: Because Velcro doesn't hold for shit.

1830
02:29:26,678 --> 02:29:28,619
[SPEAKER_15]: No, then, you know what?

1831
02:29:28,900 --> 02:29:32,442
[SPEAKER_15]: I know some girls on the Itty Bitty Titty Committee who they would work just fine for.

1832
02:29:32,462 --> 02:29:35,304
[SPEAKER_15]: But that's the whole point.

1833
02:29:36,305 --> 02:29:48,314
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm sorry, the fact that you wouldn't mind pulling the bra off of an Itty Bitty Titty Committee applicant shows that you're gay, but whatever.

1834
02:29:48,354 --> 02:29:49,855
[SPEAKER_15]: DarkSakura, you had a comment?

1835
02:29:49,955 --> 02:29:51,696
[SPEAKER_05]: I completely forgot what I was going to say.

1836
02:29:51,716 --> 02:29:54,939
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, I know, well, you shouldn't have dated girls who were girdles.

1837
02:29:56,470 --> 02:30:03,138
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

1838
02:30:03,759 --> 02:30:09,246
[SPEAKER_15]: Maybe in my mind, maybe they weren't really 20 hooks, but in my mind, I've gone back.

1839
02:30:09,286 --> 02:30:12,249
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, I'm having nightmares of the bras.

1840
02:30:12,770 --> 02:30:15,213
[SPEAKER_15]: I remember looking at the back and it's like these big teeth.

1841
02:30:17,602 --> 02:30:19,303
[SPEAKER_15]: Don't you dare touch me!

1842
02:30:19,523 --> 02:30:21,965
[SPEAKER_05]: Rob has braphobia.

1843
02:30:22,245 --> 02:30:22,445
[SPEAKER_11]: What?

1844
02:30:22,625 --> 02:30:23,546
[SPEAKER_05]: Rob has braphobia.

1845
02:30:26,527 --> 02:30:28,728
[SPEAKER_11]: He has those dreams where it's really abstract.

1846
02:30:28,768 --> 02:30:32,630
[SPEAKER_11]: He looks at it and the hooks go down towards the horizon.

1847
02:30:33,511 --> 02:30:35,772
[SPEAKER_11]: Never ending bra strap.

1848
02:30:36,833 --> 02:30:37,813
[SPEAKER_11]: That's like my hell.

1849
02:30:38,694 --> 02:30:40,995
[SPEAKER_15]: It's like, here, do you want to get into the gates of heaven?

1850
02:30:41,335 --> 02:30:44,297
[SPEAKER_15]: Just unhook the door that's very similar to a bra.

1851
02:30:44,837 --> 02:30:44,937
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh!

1852
02:30:45,197 --> 02:30:48,078
[SPEAKER_15]: And then you have sex with women and oh man, that's crazy hell.

1853
02:31:10,154 --> 02:31:11,035
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, anyway, yeah, yeah.

1854
02:31:11,095 --> 02:31:14,198
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't like all this talk about me and my bra thing.

1855
02:31:14,258 --> 02:31:15,279
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm just writing my movie.

1856
02:31:15,479 --> 02:31:15,819
[SPEAKER_15]: That's all.

1857
02:31:16,060 --> 02:31:16,880
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, your movie?

1858
02:31:16,900 --> 02:31:17,501
[SPEAKER_15]: What's your movie?

1859
02:31:17,681 --> 02:31:18,942
[SPEAKER_15]: Do you want to plug your movie?

1860
02:31:18,962 --> 02:31:19,903
[SPEAKER_15]: The Life of Rob.

1861
02:31:19,983 --> 02:31:22,526
[SPEAKER_15]: That's what people do on shows is they plug things.

1862
02:31:22,546 --> 02:31:24,147
[SPEAKER_15]: So you have a movie coming out you want to promote?

1863
02:31:24,167 --> 02:31:24,488
[SPEAKER_15]: No, I don't.

1864
02:31:24,588 --> 02:31:24,988
[SPEAKER_13]: No, you don't?

1865
02:31:25,088 --> 02:31:25,509
[SPEAKER_15]: Not yet.

1866
02:31:26,229 --> 02:31:26,970
[SPEAKER_15]: Are you writing one?

1867
02:31:26,990 --> 02:31:27,330
[SPEAKER_11]: Maybe someday.

1868
02:31:27,350 --> 02:31:28,131
[SPEAKER_11]: Do you want to pitch one?

1869
02:31:28,271 --> 02:31:28,491
[SPEAKER_11]: No.

1870
02:31:28,652 --> 02:31:30,413
[SPEAKER_15]: We have important people listening to this program.

1871
02:31:30,433 --> 02:31:30,714
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.

1872
02:31:31,915 --> 02:31:32,435
[SPEAKER_15]: Like my mother.

1873
02:31:36,519 --> 02:31:39,882
[SPEAKER_11]: Sorry, that was something that listeners couldn't see, but whatever.

1874
02:31:40,262 --> 02:31:40,723
[SPEAKER_11]: Bad radio.

1875
02:31:40,983 --> 02:31:41,363
[SPEAKER_13]: That was funny.

1876
02:31:42,605 --> 02:31:43,045
[SPEAKER_13]: Good times.

1877
02:31:45,927 --> 02:31:49,190
[SPEAKER_15]: And of course now our chat room just suddenly fills up with all this chat.

1878
02:31:49,210 --> 02:31:50,792
[SPEAKER_15]: Bra, bra, bra, bra, bra, bra, bra, bra, bra.

1879
02:31:50,932 --> 02:31:53,434
[SPEAKER_15]: Not Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, but bra, bra, bra, bra, bra.

1880
02:31:53,594 --> 02:31:56,837
[SPEAKER_05]: But we were talking about bras before we got on the verbal topic.

1881
02:31:56,997 --> 02:31:57,258
[SPEAKER_15]: I know.

1882
02:31:58,259 --> 02:31:58,479
I know.

1883
02:31:58,639 --> 02:31:59,079
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, anyways.

1884
02:31:59,360 --> 02:31:59,540
[SPEAKER_15]: What?

1885
02:31:59,760 --> 02:32:00,360
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh yes, Loki.

1886
02:32:00,721 --> 02:32:01,922
[SPEAKER_15]: Something related to video gaming.

1887
02:32:02,739 --> 02:32:03,700
[SPEAKER_14]: No, I didn't have anything.

1888
02:32:03,740 --> 02:32:07,122
[SPEAKER_14]: I was just going to say, very rare bear.

1889
02:32:08,663 --> 02:32:09,343
[SPEAKER_14]: Love the inside joke.

1890
02:32:09,463 --> 02:32:10,003
[SPEAKER_14]: I need a break.

1891
02:32:12,125 --> 02:32:13,325
[SPEAKER_05]: At least it's not cake pie.

1892
02:32:13,445 --> 02:32:15,166
[SPEAKER_15]: We're going to do a break, and then we're going to come back.

1893
02:32:16,047 --> 02:32:17,848
[SPEAKER_15]: We're going to come back, and we're going to do some Skype.

1894
02:32:19,389 --> 02:32:21,290
[SPEAKER_15]: Skype at you, coming at you.

1895
02:32:22,190 --> 02:32:26,173
[SPEAKER_15]: And then Ask Orange Lounge, because we know you want to ask us some questions.

1896
02:32:26,493 --> 02:32:28,794
[SPEAKER_15]: And therefore, we want to give you some answers.

1897
02:32:29,895 --> 02:32:30,735
[SPEAKER_15]: Does that sound like a plan?

1898
02:32:30,756 --> 02:32:30,836
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.

1899
02:32:31,756 --> 02:32:33,958
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm like, Jesus, I hope you're with my heart

1900
02:33:24,915 --> 02:33:26,078
Thank you for watching!

1901
02:33:56,092 --> 02:33:57,013
Thank you for watching!

1902
02:36:05,153 --> 02:36:06,234
Thanks for watching!

1903
02:38:48,914 --> 02:38:50,215
Thank you for watching!

1904
02:39:22,899 --> 02:39:26,760
[SPEAKER_15]: Orange Lounge Radio, Mamani Music, and more

1905
02:39:52,487 --> 02:39:53,148
[SPEAKER_15]: R2-D2 Princess Leia

1906
02:40:16,784 --> 02:40:17,605
[SPEAKER_15]: That is so cool.

1907
02:40:17,625 --> 02:40:18,385
[SPEAKER_15]: Like when I push it.

1908
02:40:18,686 --> 02:40:19,506
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, bun-headed.

1909
02:40:19,606 --> 02:40:20,387
[SPEAKER_15]: Show it on the wall.

1910
02:40:20,987 --> 02:40:22,829
[SPEAKER_15]: It's Princess Leia with a bun.

1911
02:40:22,889 --> 02:40:23,849
[SPEAKER_15]: That is so badass.

1912
02:40:24,370 --> 02:40:25,411
[SPEAKER_15]: And then I have lots of drugs.

1913
02:40:25,431 --> 02:40:25,971
[SPEAKER_15]: I want one.

1914
02:40:26,211 --> 02:40:27,792
[SPEAKER_05]: And I have like the most awesome keychain.

1915
02:40:28,633 --> 02:40:29,714
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, cell phone strap.

1916
02:40:30,214 --> 02:40:30,915
[SPEAKER_15]: What is that now?

1917
02:40:31,075 --> 02:40:31,935
[SPEAKER_05]: I have Prince.

1918
02:40:33,196 --> 02:40:34,257
[SPEAKER_15]: From Katamari Damashii.

1919
02:40:34,657 --> 02:40:35,878
[SPEAKER_15]: No, no, no, no, no.

1920
02:40:35,938 --> 02:40:38,100
[SPEAKER_15]: Now you just need the ringtones and then you'd be a total addict there.

1921
02:40:38,120 --> 02:40:39,181
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, I can get those or midis.

1922
02:40:39,401 --> 02:40:39,621
[SPEAKER_15]: Alright.

1923
02:40:40,642 --> 02:40:41,603
[SPEAKER_15]: Let's go to a call.

1924
02:40:41,643 --> 02:40:42,803
[SPEAKER_15]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

1925
02:40:42,823 --> 02:40:43,164
[SPEAKER_15]: Who dis?

1926
02:40:44,611 --> 02:40:45,752
[SPEAKER_15]: It's the one and only Ron Chan.

1927
02:40:45,772 --> 02:40:46,432
[SPEAKER_15]: What's up, fellas?

1928
02:40:46,512 --> 02:40:47,212
[SPEAKER_15]: Hello, Ron Chan.

1929
02:40:47,232 --> 02:40:47,633
[SPEAKER_15]: How are you?

1930
02:40:48,833 --> 02:40:49,534
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm doing good.

1931
02:40:49,554 --> 02:40:49,954
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm doing good.

1932
02:40:49,994 --> 02:40:52,395
[SPEAKER_15]: I just want to point out, though, DarkSakura is not a fella.

1933
02:40:54,757 --> 02:40:55,577
[SPEAKER_10]: I know, I know.

1934
02:40:55,657 --> 02:40:57,198
[SPEAKER_10]: I have that effect on women.

1935
02:40:57,318 --> 02:40:58,399
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm sorry.

1936
02:40:58,559 --> 02:40:59,359
[SPEAKER_15]: That's alright.

1937
02:41:00,200 --> 02:41:01,981
[SPEAKER_15]: I've seen you hanging with the ladies, Ron.

1938
02:41:02,081 --> 02:41:02,481
[SPEAKER_15]: Not really.

1939
02:41:02,541 --> 02:41:03,742
[SPEAKER_15]: Just a couple.

1940
02:41:04,222 --> 02:41:05,943
[SPEAKER_15]: But, no, I don't know where I'm going with that.

1941
02:41:05,983 --> 02:41:10,325
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway... I don't think it would be possible to mistake me for a dude since I have humongous boobs.

1942
02:41:11,046 --> 02:41:12,807
[SPEAKER_15]: Does your bra have 20 hooks on it?

1943
02:41:12,947 --> 02:41:13,147
[SPEAKER_15]: That's...

1944
02:41:14,341 --> 02:41:15,323
[SPEAKER_05]: No, Rob, just three.

1945
02:41:15,764 --> 02:41:16,044
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay.

1946
02:41:17,387 --> 02:41:18,188
[SPEAKER_15]: What about Velcro?

1947
02:41:18,208 --> 02:41:19,330
[SPEAKER_15]: What do you think of... Never mind, forget it.

1948
02:41:20,332 --> 02:41:21,274
[SPEAKER_15]: Rob, what's on your mind?

1949
02:41:21,294 --> 02:41:23,418
[SPEAKER_10]: Nothing much.

1950
02:41:23,458 --> 02:41:25,502
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm still addicted to Mario Kart DS.

1951
02:41:27,239 --> 02:41:27,999
[SPEAKER_15]: It is a fun game.

1952
02:41:28,020 --> 02:41:30,541
[SPEAKER_15]: Do you actually find friends online to play against?

1953
02:41:30,561 --> 02:41:33,022
[SPEAKER_15]: Because I never do, unless I set it up on Instant Messenger.

1954
02:41:34,103 --> 02:41:34,984
[SPEAKER_10]: That's the only way.

1955
02:41:35,124 --> 02:41:37,845
[SPEAKER_10]: If I'm in a chat room with a bunch of us, that's how we do it.

1956
02:41:37,865 --> 02:41:40,047
[SPEAKER_10]: And even half the time, we can't even race each other.

1957
02:41:41,007 --> 02:41:41,347
[SPEAKER_15]: Wow.

1958
02:41:41,507 --> 02:41:44,109
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, because you don't find each other on the game or something?

1959
02:41:44,149 --> 02:41:44,449
[SPEAKER_15]: Or what?

1960
02:41:45,390 --> 02:41:46,350
[SPEAKER_10]: We don't find each other.

1961
02:41:46,530 --> 02:41:48,552
[SPEAKER_10]: One time it was like five of us.

1962
02:41:48,572 --> 02:41:50,653
[SPEAKER_10]: We were going to try to get at least four of us in a race.

1963
02:41:51,073 --> 02:41:52,554
[SPEAKER_10]: It turned out to be me and two people.

1964
02:41:53,134 --> 02:41:53,975
[SPEAKER_10]: Or me and one person.

1965
02:41:54,575 --> 02:41:55,175
[SPEAKER_15]: That's weird.

1966
02:41:55,215 --> 02:41:58,257
[SPEAKER_15]: So it can't find your friends or something?

1967
02:41:58,977 --> 02:42:00,797
[SPEAKER_15]: Maybe the lag was too great or something.

1968
02:42:02,138 --> 02:42:02,698
[SPEAKER_10]: What lag?

1969
02:42:02,738 --> 02:42:05,819
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, I do this at work and the router's like six feet behind me.

1970
02:42:06,940 --> 02:42:07,820
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know what to tell you, buddy.

1971
02:42:07,940 --> 02:42:08,380
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm sorry.

1972
02:42:09,821 --> 02:42:11,822
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm not too worried about it, but I can say this.

1973
02:42:12,242 --> 02:42:17,584
[SPEAKER_10]: With my DS, I found plenty of wireless networks around my neighborhood.

1974
02:42:19,958 --> 02:42:28,163
[SPEAKER_15]: I was at Rice Princess and Lanky Styles' apartment not that long ago, and I tapped into a wireless network near them, and that made me feel like an elite hacker.

1975
02:42:28,203 --> 02:42:28,663
[SPEAKER_15]: It was cool.

1976
02:42:29,624 --> 02:42:30,764
[SPEAKER_15]: I was stealing bandwidth.

1977
02:42:30,804 --> 02:42:31,485
[SPEAKER_15]: I could go to jail.

1978
02:42:33,526 --> 02:42:34,847
[SPEAKER_10]: Hey, I call it sharing the wealth.

1979
02:42:35,347 --> 02:42:36,868
[SPEAKER_10]: Are you going to be getting Animal Crossing?

1980
02:42:38,584 --> 02:42:39,485
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe in a couple of weeks.

1981
02:42:39,625 --> 02:42:39,945
[SPEAKER_15]: All right.

1982
02:42:40,185 --> 02:42:43,687
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, when you get it, you, me, bike racks, 3 o'clock, bring your bug net.

1983
02:42:44,248 --> 02:42:44,648
[SPEAKER_15]: It's on.

1984
02:42:46,149 --> 02:42:46,609
[SPEAKER_15]: Bring it.

1985
02:42:47,009 --> 02:42:47,370
[SPEAKER_15]: Bring it.

1986
02:42:47,410 --> 02:42:48,851
[SPEAKER_15]: It's already been brought in, my friend.

1987
02:42:50,652 --> 02:42:50,912
[SPEAKER_15]: All right.

1988
02:42:51,192 --> 02:42:51,612
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, yeah.

1989
02:42:51,793 --> 02:42:54,314
[SPEAKER_10]: One thing from last week, you were talking about Captain Con.

1990
02:42:54,754 --> 02:42:54,995
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

1991
02:42:55,055 --> 02:42:58,277
[SPEAKER_10]: I went to Captain Con and we got snowed in for two days.

1992
02:42:59,354 --> 02:43:04,117
[SPEAKER_15]: If I get snowed in at this crazy convention in D.C., which I will be going to, it sounds like.

1993
02:43:04,497 --> 02:43:05,798
[SPEAKER_15]: I have the time approved off work.

1994
02:43:05,858 --> 02:43:08,339
[SPEAKER_15]: All I have to do is get a plane ticket, which are very affordable right now.

1995
02:43:08,859 --> 02:43:10,160
[SPEAKER_15]: So I'm going to be booking that sometime this week.

1996
02:43:11,360 --> 02:43:13,962
[SPEAKER_15]: I just need to discuss travel arrangements with you, my friend.

1997
02:43:15,362 --> 02:43:15,943
[SPEAKER_10]: Sure, no problem.

1998
02:43:15,983 --> 02:43:17,544
[SPEAKER_15]: If I get snowed in, I'm going to cry.

1999
02:43:17,964 --> 02:43:18,924
[SPEAKER_15]: I am from California.

2000
02:43:18,984 --> 02:43:20,465
[SPEAKER_15]: I've lived in California my entire life.

2001
02:43:20,685 --> 02:43:21,686
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't do snow.

2002
02:43:22,666 --> 02:43:23,307
[SPEAKER_15]: Do you know this?

2003
02:43:23,708 --> 02:43:26,671
[SPEAKER_15]: I have never, this is going to be a crazy concept to some of you people.

2004
02:43:27,432 --> 02:43:31,517
[SPEAKER_15]: I have never seen snow falling from the sky in person.

2005
02:43:31,777 --> 02:43:31,997
[SPEAKER_15]: Never.

2006
02:43:32,077 --> 02:43:33,439
[SPEAKER_05]: I have and that was in Alabama.

2007
02:43:34,981 --> 02:43:35,301
[SPEAKER_15]: Never.

2008
02:43:35,461 --> 02:43:37,123
[SPEAKER_15]: I've never seen snow falling from the sky.

2009
02:43:37,143 --> 02:43:39,186
[SPEAKER_05]: That was like way down south in Alabama.

2010
02:43:39,246 --> 02:43:40,027
[SPEAKER_05]: That was in Mobile.

2011
02:43:41,303 --> 02:43:42,143
[SPEAKER_15]: I've seen snow once.

2012
02:43:42,203 --> 02:43:43,063
[SPEAKER_15]: It's already on the ground.

2013
02:43:43,123 --> 02:43:45,964
[SPEAKER_15]: It's not that hard to drive up to Reno and see some snow here where we live.

2014
02:43:46,164 --> 02:43:49,365
[SPEAKER_15]: But I've never seen snow fall from the sky.

2015
02:43:49,465 --> 02:44:00,668
[SPEAKER_15]: Every time it's happened in Sacramento, like the two times this ever happens since I've been alive, I was either asleep or the one other time it ever happened, I was doing an internet radio show, believe it or not, at the old college station.

2016
02:44:01,548 --> 02:44:01,988
[SPEAKER_15]: Crazy, huh?

2017
02:44:03,128 --> 02:44:04,229
[SPEAKER_10]: We're going to have to get a wee now.

2018
02:44:04,369 --> 02:44:05,769
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

2019
02:44:05,809 --> 02:44:07,770
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, it better not snow because I don't know what to do.

2020
02:44:07,790 --> 02:44:09,510
[SPEAKER_15]: I will cry like a little girl.

2021
02:44:10,990 --> 02:44:14,911
[SPEAKER_10]: No, what'll happen is they'll shut down the airport and get out a day later.

2022
02:44:15,071 --> 02:44:18,232
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh my god, I will poop myself if that happens.

2023
02:44:18,272 --> 02:44:19,232
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't know how to deal with that.

2024
02:44:19,372 --> 02:44:20,752
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't do flight delays.

2025
02:44:22,212 --> 02:44:22,473
[SPEAKER_15]: Alright.

2026
02:44:22,513 --> 02:44:26,093
[SPEAKER_10]: That happened to a bunch of West Coast guys that came to CapsuleCon 9 two years ago.

2027
02:44:26,113 --> 02:44:27,254
[SPEAKER_10]: Stop scaring me!

2028
02:44:27,274 --> 02:44:29,514
[SPEAKER_15]: Alright, we gotta go.

2029
02:44:29,534 --> 02:44:30,114
[SPEAKER_15]: We gotta take more calls.

2030
02:44:30,134 --> 02:44:30,914
[SPEAKER_10]: You'll be there, friend.

2031
02:44:30,954 --> 02:44:31,935
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not that bad.

2032
02:44:32,075 --> 02:44:33,155
[SPEAKER_15]: We gotta take more calls.

2033
02:44:33,615 --> 02:44:34,535
[SPEAKER_15]: And you're freaking me out.

2034
02:44:34,555 --> 02:44:35,875
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm gonna have nightmares tonight about snow.

2035
02:44:35,975 --> 02:44:36,256
[SPEAKER_15]: Alright.

2036
02:44:37,436 --> 02:44:38,016
[SPEAKER_15]: Take care, my friend.

2037
02:44:39,349 --> 02:44:40,290
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you for watching!

2038
02:45:09,887 --> 02:45:10,407
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, there he is.

2039
02:45:10,448 --> 02:45:10,968
[SPEAKER_15]: He's back now.

2040
02:45:11,408 --> 02:45:12,729
[SPEAKER_15]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

2041
02:45:14,971 --> 02:45:16,572
[SPEAKER_15]: Hello, you are on Orange Lounge Radio.

2042
02:45:17,873 --> 02:45:18,194
[SPEAKER_15]: Hello.

2043
02:45:18,734 --> 02:45:19,054
[SPEAKER_15]: Hello.

2044
02:45:19,835 --> 02:45:21,536
[SPEAKER_15]: Bienvenidos a Orange Lounge Radio.

2045
02:45:22,577 --> 02:45:23,098
[SPEAKER_15]: What's on your mind?

2046
02:45:25,373 --> 02:45:26,253
[SPEAKER_15]: What is on your mind, my friend?

2047
02:45:27,593 --> 02:45:29,574
[SPEAKER_15]: Um, dang.

2048
02:45:30,794 --> 02:45:32,355
[SPEAKER_19]: First off, who the hell is this?

2049
02:45:32,575 --> 02:45:33,015
[SPEAKER_19]: Who is this?

2050
02:45:33,235 --> 02:45:34,675
[SPEAKER_19]: Finally, we have the end of the show.

2051
02:45:35,175 --> 02:45:35,815
[SPEAKER_19]: Xander from Florida.

2052
02:45:36,555 --> 02:45:37,456
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, hi, Xander from Florida.

2053
02:45:37,476 --> 02:45:37,936
[SPEAKER_19]: What's on your mind?

2054
02:45:39,456 --> 02:45:46,318
[SPEAKER_19]: Um, I don't know if this is the right show to do, but I wanted to bring up the Nintendo Revolution not supporting HDTV thingy real quick.

2055
02:45:47,018 --> 02:45:47,418
[SPEAKER_19]: Uh, sure.

2056
02:45:47,658 --> 02:45:47,958
[SPEAKER_19]: What's up?

2057
02:45:49,815 --> 02:46:02,288
[SPEAKER_19]: Well, um, basically I think the reason they're doing it is, um, well for one reason, because they're using standard DVDs, I think it's not really smart to be, uh, doing HD.

2058
02:46:02,909 --> 02:46:11,598
[SPEAKER_19]: Because, I mean, you're seeing with the, uh, Xbox 360 with, um, Oblivion, or, yeah, Oblivion, it's like gonna take up four discs or something like that.

2059
02:46:13,226 --> 02:46:15,147
[SPEAKER_19]: That's one thing, another thing is the cost.

2060
02:46:15,308 --> 02:46:19,831
[SPEAKER_19]: I mean, it's just going to be a ridiculous cost to small developers to try to put HD in their games.

2061
02:46:20,764 --> 02:46:22,125
[SPEAKER_15]: I somewhat agree with you.

2062
02:46:22,286 --> 02:46:29,672
[SPEAKER_15]: I also think the reason why they're not doing it is because Loki has me convinced that the revolution is the fact that there is going to be stereoscopic 3D.

2063
02:46:30,032 --> 02:46:31,773
[SPEAKER_15]: And they just don't want to do that for HDTV.

2064
02:46:31,813 --> 02:46:32,594
[SPEAKER_15]: That would cost too much.

2065
02:46:32,934 --> 02:46:35,496
[SPEAKER_19]: I heard you say that too.

2066
02:46:35,577 --> 02:46:37,058
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't know if they're going to do that.

2067
02:46:37,398 --> 02:46:38,179
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't know.

2068
02:46:38,339 --> 02:46:39,400
[SPEAKER_19]: I think that would cost too much.

2069
02:46:40,160 --> 02:46:40,521
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't know.

2070
02:46:40,641 --> 02:46:43,623
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't think it would fit in their $200 price range thingy.

2071
02:46:43,843 --> 02:46:48,527
[SPEAKER_15]: If they have a good development kit, all you need is 3D World Runner all over again.

2072
02:46:48,647 --> 02:46:49,268
[SPEAKER_15]: Rad Racer.

2073
02:46:52,370 --> 02:46:55,513
[SPEAKER_15]: Can somebody explain to me what the fuck the point was of 3D and Rad Racer?

2074
02:46:55,593 --> 02:46:57,114
[SPEAKER_15]: It did like nothing for that game.

2075
02:46:57,394 --> 02:46:58,895
[SPEAKER_15]: 3D and Rad Racer did nothing.

2076
02:46:59,596 --> 02:47:00,737
[SPEAKER_14]: It was so rad.

2077
02:47:01,237 --> 02:47:01,557
[SPEAKER_15]: Shut up.

2078
02:47:03,459 --> 02:47:04,059
[SPEAKER_15]: You know what?

2079
02:47:04,139 --> 02:47:05,200
[SPEAKER_15]: You bring up some good points.

2080
02:47:05,260 --> 02:47:09,063
[SPEAKER_15]: And I, owning an HDTV, it makes me sad that Nintendo is not supporting it.

2081
02:47:09,143 --> 02:47:12,246
[SPEAKER_15]: However, if they're doing it for cost reasons...

2082
02:47:12,646 --> 02:47:23,097
[SPEAKER_15]: and if they're doing it for these other reasons that they plan to do more crazy shit with their system, I'm okay with it, but remember the golden rule, a system is only a good game.

2083
02:47:23,778 --> 02:47:25,059
[SPEAKER_15]: Wow, we've got the whole internet saying that.

2084
02:47:25,099 --> 02:47:30,405
[SPEAKER_14]: Here's the other thing also, just because they say they're not supporting HD does not mean that the

2085
02:47:30,885 --> 02:47:37,848
[SPEAKER_14]: It just means they're not supporting the formats of HD, you know, the aspect ratios and stuff, so it could be something completely different also.

2086
02:47:37,968 --> 02:47:40,849
[SPEAKER_15]: Maybe they'll still support progressive scan and widescreen.

2087
02:47:41,069 --> 02:47:41,950
[SPEAKER_15]: That would be okay.

2088
02:47:42,030 --> 02:47:45,131
[SPEAKER_15]: Maybe they'll support 480, what would that be, 480p.

2089
02:47:45,151 --> 02:47:45,671
[SPEAKER_15]: 480, yeah.

2090
02:47:45,691 --> 02:47:46,312
[SPEAKER_15]: That's okay.

2091
02:47:46,532 --> 02:47:48,293
[SPEAKER_15]: There's some pretty good looking games at 480p.

2092
02:47:49,413 --> 02:47:50,073
[SPEAKER_15]: Maybe you're right.

2093
02:47:50,133 --> 02:47:54,395
[SPEAKER_15]: Maybe the fact that they're not doing HDTV means they're not going to support 1080p or something.

2094
02:47:54,795 --> 02:47:55,336
[SPEAKER_15]: That's okay.

2095
02:47:55,476 --> 02:47:58,457
[SPEAKER_15]: As long as my games can have some widescreen in it and some progressive...

2096
02:47:58,917 --> 02:47:59,177
[SPEAKER_15]: Damn it.

2097
02:47:59,458 --> 02:48:00,919
[SPEAKER_15]: Some progressive scan, some widescreen.

2098
02:48:01,099 --> 02:48:03,882
[SPEAKER_15]: That would be kind of cool, but I'm not going to hold my breath with Nintendo here.

2099
02:48:04,643 --> 02:48:04,863
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.

2100
02:48:05,764 --> 02:48:11,629
[SPEAKER_19]: Well, they're supposed to announce more... Did you hear that they have another big secret, apparently?

2101
02:48:12,690 --> 02:48:13,391
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, yeah.

2102
02:48:13,431 --> 02:48:14,893
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, that it's stereoscopic 3D.

2103
02:48:14,953 --> 02:48:20,017
[SPEAKER_19]: No, they're saying... They're saying... There's... Mario Mato did another speech...

2104
02:48:21,182 --> 02:48:24,164
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, yeah, yeah, I heard, I read somewhere that Miyamoto did another speech.

2105
02:48:24,564 --> 02:48:27,906
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, just to add to your argument, somebody posted this on LJ and I saw this.

2106
02:48:28,306 --> 02:48:34,770
[SPEAKER_15]: Miyamoto did another speech and said there's a, there's another secret coming that you kids don't know about, so just you wait for it.

2107
02:48:35,011 --> 02:48:39,173
[SPEAKER_14]: Everyone thinks it's about the controller because he was talking about the controller at the time, but I don't think it is.

2108
02:48:39,253 --> 02:48:41,474
[SPEAKER_14]: I think it's, it's still the SiriusXP3 thing.

2109
02:48:43,923 --> 02:48:44,904
[SPEAKER_15]: What did he say about the controller?

2110
02:48:45,505 --> 02:48:46,827
[SPEAKER_15]: What else could they say about the controller?

2111
02:48:47,047 --> 02:48:50,571
[SPEAKER_15]: That you're going to use it in the stereoscopic 3D games.

2112
02:48:52,413 --> 02:48:54,695
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, I don't know.

2113
02:48:54,735 --> 02:48:55,456
[SPEAKER_15]: Maybe you're on to something.

2114
02:48:55,516 --> 02:48:55,937
[SPEAKER_15]: We'll see.

2115
02:48:56,157 --> 02:48:56,477
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't know.

2116
02:48:56,758 --> 02:48:57,899
[SPEAKER_15]: And maybe we're fucking idiots.

2117
02:48:57,959 --> 02:48:58,239
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't know.

2118
02:48:58,279 --> 02:48:59,180
[SPEAKER_15]: We'll see soon enough.

2119
02:49:01,155 --> 02:49:03,676
[SPEAKER_15]: But it's fun to imagine, isn't it?

2120
02:49:04,416 --> 02:49:04,896
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, we will.

2121
02:49:05,256 --> 02:49:06,277
[SPEAKER_15]: We'll be first in line.

2122
02:49:06,937 --> 02:49:07,917
[SPEAKER_15]: Hopefully they won't kick us out.

2123
02:49:07,937 --> 02:49:09,738
[SPEAKER_15]: We're going to let you go, buddy.

2124
02:49:09,758 --> 02:49:11,058
[SPEAKER_15]: We've got to get to the next segment, alright?

2125
02:49:11,999 --> 02:49:13,339
[SPEAKER_15]: But thank you for your input.

2126
02:49:13,619 --> 02:49:14,119
[SPEAKER_15]: Have a good one.

2127
02:49:15,100 --> 02:49:15,400
[SPEAKER_15]: You too.

2128
02:49:15,560 --> 02:49:15,840
[SPEAKER_15]: Later.

2129
02:49:15,860 --> 02:49:20,221
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, I apologize to those folks we didn't get to on Skype.

2130
02:49:21,422 --> 02:49:22,982
[SPEAKER_15]: We'll get to you guys next week.

2131
02:49:24,143 --> 02:49:24,643
[SPEAKER_15]: Promise.

2132
02:49:25,983 --> 02:49:29,425
[SPEAKER_15]: But we promised the chatters we'd get to some Ask Orange Lounge.

2133
02:49:29,985 --> 02:49:31,706
[SPEAKER_15]: So therefore, that's what we're going to do right now.

2134
02:49:31,806 --> 02:49:32,647
[SPEAKER_15]: Some Ask Orange Lounge.

2135
02:49:40,051 --> 02:49:41,312
[SPEAKER_15]: Let's Ask Orange Lounge.

2136
02:49:41,892 --> 02:49:43,032
[SPEAKER_15]: Some stupid question.

2137
02:49:43,493 --> 02:49:46,814
[SPEAKER_15]: What will we find out this week on Orange Lounge Radio?

2138
02:49:47,435 --> 02:49:51,957
[SPEAKER_15]: Maybe we'll find out how to unhook a bra or maybe not.

2139
02:49:52,958 --> 02:49:53,298
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't know.

2140
02:49:53,318 --> 02:49:54,279
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't want to finish that thought.

2141
02:49:54,519 --> 02:49:54,619
[SPEAKER_15]: Um...

2142
02:49:57,236 --> 02:49:58,017
[SPEAKER_05]: You rhymed anyway.

2143
02:49:58,637 --> 02:50:07,582
[SPEAKER_15]: Sakurina says, I want to plug DSMeet.com, which is a DS Friends code sharing site that Loki joined, apparently.

2144
02:50:07,722 --> 02:50:08,543
[SPEAKER_15]: Loki, is this true?

2145
02:50:08,563 --> 02:50:09,664
[SPEAKER_15]: Are these allegations true?

2146
02:50:09,864 --> 02:50:12,385
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, but I haven't visited the site since, and I was bored.

2147
02:50:12,525 --> 02:50:15,167
[SPEAKER_15]: I thought our buddy BigRedPimp started his own thing.

2148
02:50:15,287 --> 02:50:20,169
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, and you know what's funny is because I couldn't log into that thing at all because it was broken.

2149
02:50:20,349 --> 02:50:21,630
[SPEAKER_15]: Email him and tell him he'll fix it.

2150
02:50:21,690 --> 02:50:22,330
[SPEAKER_15]: I just don't care.

2151
02:50:22,350 --> 02:50:22,870
[SPEAKER_15]: He loves you.

2152
02:50:23,410 --> 02:50:30,894
[SPEAKER_15]: Alright, Sakurina wants to know, am I the only one to think Snow by Ram when you guys talk about Snow?

2153
02:50:32,854 --> 02:50:35,776
[SPEAKER_15]: And I say no, you're probably not the only one to think about that song.

2154
02:50:35,836 --> 02:50:38,097
[SPEAKER_15]: However, that does make you a loser.

2155
02:50:38,757 --> 02:50:39,217
[SPEAKER_15]: Just kidding.

2156
02:50:40,078 --> 02:50:40,998
[SPEAKER_15]: Hearts, love ya.

2157
02:50:42,816 --> 02:50:43,476
[SPEAKER_15]: Just kidding.

2158
02:50:45,417 --> 02:50:50,138
[SPEAKER_15]: Sephiroth1215 says, What do you think is the most overrated DDR song?

2159
02:50:50,278 --> 02:50:53,179
[SPEAKER_15]: I say Butterfly, says Sephiroth1215.

2160
02:50:53,519 --> 02:50:55,480
[SPEAKER_15]: Most overrated DDR song.

2161
02:50:56,240 --> 02:50:57,800
[SPEAKER_15]: Maxx300, hands down.

2162
02:50:58,101 --> 02:50:58,881
[SPEAKER_15]: Hands down, Maxx300.

2163
02:50:58,961 --> 02:51:00,841
[SPEAKER_15]: DarkSakura.

2164
02:51:00,861 --> 02:51:02,422
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I'd have to agree.

2165
02:51:02,582 --> 02:51:03,082
[SPEAKER_15]: Maxx300.

2166
02:51:03,362 --> 02:51:03,682
[SPEAKER_15]: Loki.

2167
02:51:04,122 --> 02:51:04,322
Huh?

2168
02:51:04,743 --> 02:51:06,003
[SPEAKER_15]: Most overrated DDR song.

2169
02:51:06,815 --> 02:51:08,917
[SPEAKER_15]: Overrated DDR song, Max period.

2170
02:51:10,278 --> 02:51:11,059
[SPEAKER_15]: We all said Max's.

2171
02:51:11,499 --> 02:51:13,801
[SPEAKER_15]: And will you be my Animal Crossing friend?

2172
02:51:16,283 --> 02:51:18,184
[SPEAKER_15]: Only if you let me abuse your town folk.

2173
02:51:19,025 --> 02:51:21,867
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm going to leave signs in your town.

2174
02:51:22,108 --> 02:51:24,129
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, and let us paint your town.

2175
02:51:25,670 --> 02:51:26,751
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll paint your town gay.

2176
02:51:28,733 --> 02:51:30,134
[SPEAKER_15]: We're going to come gay up your town.

2177
02:51:31,335 --> 02:51:33,397
[SPEAKER_15]: We're going to give you a makeover, girlfriend!

2178
02:51:38,527 --> 02:51:40,388
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm going to put up signs that just have bras on them.

2179
02:51:42,510 --> 02:51:43,851
[SPEAKER_15]: That should be the new Orange Lounge logo.

2180
02:51:44,331 --> 02:51:46,353
[SPEAKER_05]: I really hope that the town lesbian comes back.

2181
02:51:46,513 --> 02:51:53,558
[SPEAKER_15]: By the way, I want to say just in time for Christmas, because I don't know why bras make me think of this, but the Orange Lounge t-shirt is going to happen.

2182
02:51:54,798 --> 02:51:56,260
[SPEAKER_15]: We got a company to say they'd do it.

2183
02:51:56,420 --> 02:51:57,140
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm very excited.

2184
02:51:57,480 --> 02:51:59,382
[SPEAKER_15]: So we're going to talk about that later.

2185
02:51:59,402 --> 02:52:00,122
[SPEAKER_15]: We're going to do it.

2186
02:52:00,382 --> 02:52:01,123
[SPEAKER_15]: We're going to do it.

2187
02:52:03,047 --> 02:52:07,268
[SPEAKER_15]: Illusion wants to know, what do you think is truly, truly, truly outrageous?

2188
02:52:07,388 --> 02:52:09,449
[SPEAKER_15]: Jem and the Holograms or the Misfits?

2189
02:52:09,589 --> 02:52:12,069
[SPEAKER_15]: Not the punk band, the original Misfits.

2190
02:52:13,650 --> 02:52:17,070
[SPEAKER_15]: I would say, you know, Jem was the shit.

2191
02:52:17,410 --> 02:52:19,291
[SPEAKER_15]: The Misfits were just a bunch of fucking wannabes.

2192
02:52:19,471 --> 02:52:19,851
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm sorry.

2193
02:52:20,571 --> 02:52:23,092
[SPEAKER_05]: Except the Misfits had Jetta later on.

2194
02:52:23,572 --> 02:52:24,832
[SPEAKER_05]: And she played a black saxophone.

2195
02:52:24,972 --> 02:52:25,372
[SPEAKER_15]: True.

2196
02:52:26,693 --> 02:52:27,813
[SPEAKER_05]: It doesn't get cooler than that.

2197
02:52:27,833 --> 02:52:28,273
[SPEAKER_14]: Your thoughts?

2198
02:52:28,673 --> 02:52:29,713
[SPEAKER_14]: Jem or the Misfits?

2199
02:52:30,034 --> 02:52:31,814
[SPEAKER_14]: I think her show sucked.

2200
02:52:34,628 --> 02:52:36,389
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, well, I think you smell like butt.

2201
02:52:37,609 --> 02:52:45,312
[SPEAKER_15]: Spirit Snare would like to know, what is the meaning of life, the universe, and everything to the X?

2202
02:52:45,492 --> 02:52:45,972
[SPEAKER_02]: Forty-two.

2203
02:52:49,754 --> 02:52:50,074
[SPEAKER_15]: Purple.

2204
02:52:51,674 --> 02:52:52,615
[SPEAKER_05]: It's forty-two, really.

2205
02:52:52,815 --> 02:52:53,115
[SPEAKER_15]: Purple.

2206
02:52:53,375 --> 02:52:56,456
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the whole purpose of the Earth, was to calculate the meaning of life, and it's forty-two.

2207
02:52:56,596 --> 02:52:56,916
[SPEAKER_15]: Purple.

2208
02:52:58,217 --> 02:52:58,517
[SPEAKER_15]: Loki?

2209
02:52:59,718 --> 02:53:00,438
[SPEAKER_15]: The meaning of life.

2210
02:53:01,627 --> 02:53:05,049
[SPEAKER_15]: is to listen to Orange Launch Radio every Sunday night at 6.30 Pacific Standard Time.

2211
02:53:07,390 --> 02:53:07,550
[SPEAKER_15]: No.

2212
02:53:07,930 --> 02:53:10,191
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, Jesus Christ, Rene just reminded me of something.

2213
02:53:11,411 --> 02:53:18,034
[SPEAKER_15]: Have any of the hosts had a memorable moment, oh, this is from Rene, playing any DDR or music game in front of a crowd of sorts?

2214
02:53:19,615 --> 02:53:29,299
[SPEAKER_15]: I have an alter ego known as Dr. Dick that does improv freestyle at some tournaments and got quite a big crowd at Pier 39 doing, what song did I do?

2215
02:53:29,379 --> 02:53:30,700
[SPEAKER_15]: Was it Cowgirl I did at that one?

2216
02:53:31,960 --> 02:53:33,241
[SPEAKER_15]: No, the first time was this Raining Men.

2217
02:53:33,501 --> 02:53:33,701
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

2218
02:53:33,802 --> 02:53:35,422
[SPEAKER_15]: Was it Shaft 2 or something?

2219
02:53:35,623 --> 02:53:36,463
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, Shaft.

2220
02:53:36,823 --> 02:53:42,166
[SPEAKER_15]: And the second time Dr. Dick came out was doing Cowgirl at B3 is what it was called.

2221
02:53:42,667 --> 02:53:43,087
[SPEAKER_15]: Good times.

2222
02:53:43,867 --> 02:53:44,188
[SPEAKER_15]: Loki.

2223
02:53:45,328 --> 02:53:46,569
[SPEAKER_15]: I think I'm the one involving you.

2224
02:53:46,589 --> 02:53:48,150
[SPEAKER_15]: It was one of the first times I met you.

2225
02:53:48,170 --> 02:53:54,494
[SPEAKER_15]: It was at the Sacramento's Cosplay and Tournament, and you did your routine dynamite rave, like, and you were dressed up all night.

2226
02:53:54,534 --> 02:53:55,354
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, yeah, I completely forgot.

2227
02:53:55,374 --> 02:53:56,315
[SPEAKER_15]: And you fucking failed.

2228
02:53:57,537 --> 02:53:58,717
[SPEAKER_15]: That's because I forgot my steps.

2229
02:53:59,678 --> 02:54:04,599
[SPEAKER_15]: You started dancing and you were like getting down and doing the whole thing and then you were like, like you froze from it and you were like, aw shit.

2230
02:54:04,659 --> 02:54:05,379
[SPEAKER_15]: And then you failed.

2231
02:54:06,220 --> 02:54:08,840
[SPEAKER_15]: That wasn't like one of the first times you... I was like, that guy rocks.

2232
02:54:08,900 --> 02:54:09,301
[SPEAKER_15]: No, it was.

2233
02:54:09,341 --> 02:54:10,261
[SPEAKER_15]: It was later on.

2234
02:54:10,301 --> 02:54:12,081
[SPEAKER_15]: But this was pre-OLR.

2235
02:54:12,381 --> 02:54:13,422
[SPEAKER_15]: This was pre-OLR.

2236
02:54:16,243 --> 02:54:16,543
[SPEAKER_15]: Alright.

2237
02:54:17,623 --> 02:54:18,523
[SPEAKER_15]: DarkSakura, do you have any?

2238
02:54:18,863 --> 02:54:19,544
[SPEAKER_15]: I can think of one.

2239
02:54:19,904 --> 02:54:20,844
[SPEAKER_15]: It was you and me, but...

2240
02:54:21,942 --> 02:54:27,029
[SPEAKER_05]: Let Doing Stomp to My Beat and Beating Each Other with the Orange Bats and Little Plastic Trumpets

2241
02:54:37,205 --> 02:54:37,665
[SPEAKER_15]: DarkSakura.com

2242
02:55:01,024 --> 02:55:01,244
[SPEAKER_15]: Catamaris

2243
02:55:25,225 --> 02:55:25,565
[SPEAKER_15]: Enjoy.

2244
02:55:26,366 --> 02:55:27,726
[SPEAKER_15]: And who won the cage match?

2245
02:55:28,146 --> 02:55:29,547
[SPEAKER_15]: Is the thing he reminded me of.

2246
02:55:30,047 --> 02:55:32,308
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh yeah, you guys want to know who won a cage match tonight, huh?

2247
02:55:32,328 --> 02:55:34,530
[SPEAKER_15]: Because I completely forgot to mention it a little bit ago.

2248
02:55:35,210 --> 02:55:38,491
[SPEAKER_15]: Tonight's cage match wiener is by, I think this is by one vote.

2249
02:55:38,792 --> 02:55:39,792
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes, by only one vote.

2250
02:55:41,633 --> 02:55:42,073
[SPEAKER_13]: Kat.

2251
02:55:45,675 --> 02:55:48,076
[SPEAKER_15]: Let's face it, you've missed her from DDR, that's why you let her win.

2252
02:55:48,897 --> 02:55:49,277
[SPEAKER_15]: Alright.

2253
02:55:50,477 --> 02:55:51,638
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you for reminding me, Renee.

2254
02:55:51,698 --> 02:55:53,419
[SPEAKER_15]: God, if it wasn't for you, the show would be ruined.

2255
02:55:54,905 --> 02:55:58,128
[SPEAKER_15]: Ron Chan wants to know, will you be doing some freestyling at KatsuCon?

2256
02:55:58,509 --> 02:56:04,675
[SPEAKER_15]: Ron Chan, since you asked, I will bring the hat and the garb, and Dr. Dick will make an appearance.

2257
02:56:08,591 --> 02:56:11,653
[SPEAKER_15]: NintendoManiac64 says, why are you guys so awesome?

2258
02:56:12,093 --> 02:56:16,196
[SPEAKER_15]: I found a torrent for Japanese that took 46 hours to download and I already know some sentences.

2259
02:56:17,397 --> 02:56:17,878
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, God.

2260
02:56:18,658 --> 02:56:20,220
[SPEAKER_15]: This person is making me read Japanese.

2261
02:56:20,280 --> 02:56:20,740
[SPEAKER_15]: It's not fair.

2262
02:56:21,481 --> 02:56:27,065
[SPEAKER_15]: Remember, Spanish.

2263
02:56:27,886 --> 02:56:31,609
[SPEAKER_15]: I think I was close.

2264
02:56:31,869 --> 02:56:32,629
[SPEAKER_15]: I think I was close.

2265
02:56:34,371 --> 02:56:34,591
[SPEAKER_03]: Where?

2266
02:56:34,951 --> 02:56:35,271
[SPEAKER_15]: Right there.

2267
02:56:35,331 --> 02:56:35,852
[SPEAKER_15]: Starting right there.

2268
02:56:36,423 --> 02:56:41,947
[SPEAKER_03]: I am Japanese... Japanese... What's Nihondo?

2269
02:56:42,207 --> 02:56:45,050
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, I think he meant, why did I type that with a D when it should have been a G?

2270
02:56:45,210 --> 02:56:45,470
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

2271
02:56:46,190 --> 02:56:51,574
[SPEAKER_03]: I am Japanese... Okay, it's supposed to be S-U-K-O...

2272
02:56:54,269 --> 02:56:55,569
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, who cares?

2273
02:56:55,609 --> 02:56:56,570
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm trying to say Skoshee.

2274
02:56:56,850 --> 02:56:57,310
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, who cares?

2275
02:56:59,050 --> 02:57:00,330
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I need to correct you.

2276
02:57:00,370 --> 02:57:00,570
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

2277
02:57:00,611 --> 02:57:01,091
[SPEAKER_15]: All right.

2278
02:57:01,991 --> 02:57:09,813
[SPEAKER_15]: Nintendo Maniac, what he really wants to know, is a Mario Kart DS online record of 199 wins and 34 losses good?

2279
02:57:11,213 --> 02:57:12,993
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, but it means you do need to go outside more often.

2280
02:57:13,313 --> 02:57:14,234
[SPEAKER_15]: Maybe race a real car.

2281
02:57:14,474 --> 02:57:14,894
[SPEAKER_15]: Just kidding.

2282
02:57:14,934 --> 02:57:15,974
[SPEAKER_15]: Just kidding.

2283
02:57:16,014 --> 02:57:16,734
[SPEAKER_15]: Question for Loki.

2284
02:57:16,774 --> 02:57:18,775
[SPEAKER_15]: Can I race you in Mario Kart DS again?

2285
02:57:18,895 --> 02:57:20,515
[SPEAKER_15]: I remember that you're anti-snaking.

2286
02:57:21,795 --> 02:57:22,096
[SPEAKER_15]: Loki.

2287
02:57:22,236 --> 02:57:23,096
[SPEAKER_15]: I guess if I'm on.

2288
02:57:23,136 --> 02:57:23,356
[SPEAKER_15]: All right.

2289
02:57:27,923 --> 02:57:30,845
[SPEAKER_15]: Jada2005, what is the best metal DDR pad?

2290
02:57:30,865 --> 02:57:32,126
[SPEAKER_15]: Because I want to get one for Christmas.

2291
02:57:33,607 --> 02:57:35,008
[SPEAKER_15]: Red Octane's Afterburner, honestly.

2292
02:57:38,111 --> 02:57:42,093
[SPEAKER_15]: Roz, why wouldn't the Java IRC client work?

2293
02:57:42,174 --> 02:57:44,915
[SPEAKER_15]: I couldn't get into it and it made me late for the show chat.

2294
02:57:44,956 --> 02:57:45,316
[SPEAKER_15]: Sadness.

2295
02:57:46,176 --> 02:57:51,600
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't know because that's done by another company, but I'll look into it and see if it's just you or if it breaks for us too.

2296
02:57:51,620 --> 02:57:53,922
[SPEAKER_15]: And if it breaks for us too, then we'll have to spank it.

2297
02:57:57,009 --> 02:57:58,850
[SPEAKER_15]: Sephiroth 1215, by the way, had a follow-up.

2298
02:58:00,271 --> 02:58:03,192
[SPEAKER_15]: That's okay if we want to visit his village, but please don't gay it up.

2299
02:58:09,375 --> 02:58:16,558
[SPEAKER_15]: Legend of Zaku says, how come mainstream youth media outlets such as MTV only care about rap and sports games?

2300
02:58:17,218 --> 02:58:24,661
[SPEAKER_15]: Because that, unfortunately, is what the people are buying, and if the people stop buying that shit, they will not promote it anymore, is my thought.

2301
02:58:24,681 --> 02:58:25,422
[SPEAKER_05]: Because of cock.

2302
02:58:26,826 --> 02:58:30,710
[SPEAKER_15]: Very, very Margaret Cho gay.

2303
02:58:51,098 --> 02:58:54,180
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't have anything like that that I can find on demand.

2304
02:58:54,300 --> 02:58:55,160
[SPEAKER_05]: Next week, honey, next week.

2305
02:58:55,180 --> 02:58:55,941
[SPEAKER_05]: Then play the first one.

2306
02:58:56,001 --> 02:58:56,261
[SPEAKER_15]: All right.

2307
02:58:56,641 --> 02:58:57,081
[SPEAKER_15]: You got it.

2308
02:58:58,822 --> 02:59:00,623
[SPEAKER_15]: You know what would be perfect for that?

2309
02:59:00,943 --> 02:59:01,123
[SPEAKER_14]: What?

2310
02:59:01,143 --> 02:59:02,364
[SPEAKER_14]: It would be Hooray for Boobies.

2311
02:59:03,644 --> 02:59:05,685
[SPEAKER_15]: Hooray for Boobies would be a good one, but I don't have that.

2312
02:59:07,106 --> 02:59:08,107
[SPEAKER_15]: We got more questions, kids.

2313
02:59:08,427 --> 02:59:13,770
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you know we don't have that song from Beaches where Bette Midler was singing the origination of the bird?

2314
02:59:13,790 --> 02:59:16,671
[SPEAKER_10]: Did you ever know that you're mine here?

2315
02:59:17,011 --> 02:59:17,271
[SPEAKER_05]: The...

2316
02:59:19,625 --> 02:59:21,585
[SPEAKER_05]: The Over-the-Shoulder Boulder Holder.

2317
02:59:23,066 --> 02:59:23,626
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, Jesus Christ.

2318
02:59:23,646 --> 02:59:26,166
[SPEAKER_05]: You remember when she was singing about... Oh, my God.

2319
02:59:26,186 --> 02:59:29,407
[SPEAKER_15]: About... Somehow you have outgayed me.

2320
02:59:29,527 --> 02:59:30,187
[SPEAKER_15]: Good job.

2321
02:59:30,627 --> 02:59:31,688
[SPEAKER_15]: Good job.

2322
02:59:31,708 --> 02:59:32,648
[SPEAKER_05]: Otto Titzlinger.

2323
02:59:32,708 --> 02:59:33,308
[SPEAKER_05]: That was it.

2324
02:59:33,628 --> 02:59:35,648
[SPEAKER_15]: I have no idea what Titzlinger was.

2325
02:59:35,708 --> 02:59:37,929
[SPEAKER_15]: Well played, DarkSakura.

2326
02:59:37,949 --> 02:59:38,929
[SPEAKER_15]: Well played.

2327
02:59:39,489 --> 02:59:40,770
[SPEAKER_15]: You have outgayed me.

2328
02:59:40,990 --> 02:59:42,770
[SPEAKER_05]: That's just my favorite song in that movie.

2329
02:59:46,303 --> 02:59:48,286
[SPEAKER_15]: Alright, question from DarkTetsuya.

2330
02:59:48,626 --> 02:59:49,767
[SPEAKER_15]: Have you seen the Carl's Jr.

2331
02:59:49,808 --> 02:59:55,395
[SPEAKER_15]: Milkshake commercial and do you find it ironic that they used Get Busy since they had the DDR promotion last month?

2332
02:59:58,078 --> 03:00:00,321
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, that and Let's See.

2333
03:00:06,112 --> 03:00:19,280
[SPEAKER_15]: You know, I can't... Look, why would you use... Why would you use that song when there is the completely more obvious song that you use in your milkshake commercial?

2334
03:00:21,742 --> 03:00:25,444
[SPEAKER_08]: Because most people listen to... Wait, hold on, hold on.

2335
03:00:25,544 --> 03:00:26,284
[SPEAKER_08]: E. Carl's Jr.

2336
03:00:36,229 --> 03:00:36,469
[SPEAKER_15]: See?

2337
03:00:36,950 --> 03:00:37,910
[SPEAKER_15]: I should produce commercials.

2338
03:00:41,313 --> 03:00:43,075
[SPEAKER_15]: I forgot about the DDR promotion last month.

2339
03:00:43,535 --> 03:00:43,875
[SPEAKER_09]: My bad.

2340
03:00:45,977 --> 03:00:48,119
[SPEAKER_15]: Goggles says, what is your favorite Christmas song?

2341
03:00:48,159 --> 03:00:52,383
[SPEAKER_15]: My favorite Christmas song is Little Drummer Boy because I get to say pa rum pa pum pum.

2342
03:00:52,783 --> 03:00:54,584
[SPEAKER_15]: I also, Grandma Got Run Over by a Reindeer.

2343
03:00:54,624 --> 03:00:55,085
[SPEAKER_15]: Close second.

2344
03:00:55,585 --> 03:01:00,389
[SPEAKER_05]: My favorite one is Dancing Around in Women's Underwear.

2345
03:01:00,409 --> 03:01:01,150
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

2346
03:01:01,570 --> 03:01:01,871
[SPEAKER_14]: Loki?

2347
03:01:02,211 --> 03:01:03,392
[SPEAKER_14]: Christmas at Ground Zero.

2348
03:01:07,095 --> 03:01:07,535
[SPEAKER_15]: All right.

2349
03:01:07,835 --> 03:01:09,917
[SPEAKER_05]: Actually, I also like The Night Santa Went Crazy.

2350
03:01:11,618 --> 03:01:12,399
[SPEAKER_15]: Last one, last one.

2351
03:01:13,199 --> 03:01:17,263
[SPEAKER_15]: NeoDude0 wants to know, do any of you play Magic the Gathering?

2352
03:01:18,404 --> 03:01:18,904
I used to.

2353
03:01:19,124 --> 03:01:19,564
[SPEAKER_15]: I used to.

2354
03:01:19,805 --> 03:01:21,966
[SPEAKER_05]: I had, like, all blackboarded cards.

2355
03:01:22,367 --> 03:01:23,408
[SPEAKER_04]: They were betas and alphas.

2356
03:01:24,669 --> 03:01:26,470
[SPEAKER_04]: I still have my 4th edition stuff.

2357
03:01:26,770 --> 03:01:27,491
[SPEAKER_04]: Nerd!

2358
03:01:27,511 --> 03:01:30,713
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, but I don't play it anymore.

2359
03:01:30,974 --> 03:01:32,995
[SPEAKER_04]: I can play sometimes.

2360
03:01:33,015 --> 03:01:33,135
[SPEAKER_04]: Nerd!

2361
03:01:34,376 --> 03:01:42,423
[SPEAKER_15]: Sometimes late at night you take them out and you tickle yourself with them.

2362
03:01:43,304 --> 03:01:45,706
[SPEAKER_15]: I need to tap my mana.

2363
03:01:45,726 --> 03:01:47,687
[SPEAKER_04]: I need another thrall token.

2364
03:01:48,488 --> 03:01:49,249
[SPEAKER_04]: Swarm me.

2365
03:01:49,349 --> 03:01:51,170
[SPEAKER_04]: At least I didn't say Felden's cane.

2366
03:01:52,992 --> 03:01:55,934
[SPEAKER_04]: I need me an acid manipulator.

2367
03:02:01,098 --> 03:02:01,699
[SPEAKER_15]: I hate this show.

2368
03:02:02,179 --> 03:02:04,241
[SPEAKER_15]: All right.

2369
03:02:04,581 --> 03:02:06,302
[SPEAKER_15]: That's going to do it because I hate this show.

2370
03:02:06,603 --> 03:02:10,426
[SPEAKER_15]: We're going to finish up and put the nail in the proverbial coffin of this program.

2371
03:02:11,587 --> 03:02:12,788
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you folks for listening.

2372
03:02:12,808 --> 03:02:16,090
[SPEAKER_15]: We'll be back next week with more of the same shit that you know and love.

2373
03:02:18,632 --> 03:02:19,433
[SPEAKER_15]: Final thought time.

2374
03:02:19,593 --> 03:02:22,095
[SPEAKER_15]: Angel, I hope you had a good show.

2375
03:02:22,455 --> 03:02:23,076
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, I did.

2376
03:02:23,156 --> 03:02:23,416
[SPEAKER_15]: Good.

2377
03:02:23,656 --> 03:02:26,259
[SPEAKER_04]: And good people came over and it was all good.

2378
03:02:26,479 --> 03:02:26,699
[SPEAKER_15]: Good.

2379
03:02:26,999 --> 03:02:27,860
[SPEAKER_15]: What's your final thought, my dear?

2380
03:02:30,133 --> 03:02:31,153
[SPEAKER_04]: Must get that job.

2381
03:02:32,253 --> 03:02:32,474
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

2382
03:02:33,094 --> 03:02:33,874
[SPEAKER_15]: Good luck, my friend.

2383
03:02:34,014 --> 03:02:35,295
[SPEAKER_15]: Loki, final thought.

2384
03:02:35,995 --> 03:02:37,175
[SPEAKER_15]: Must eat more brownies.

2385
03:02:37,215 --> 03:02:38,556
[SPEAKER_15]: Stop stuffing your face with brownies.

2386
03:02:39,096 --> 03:02:41,117
[SPEAKER_15]: How much weight have you gained since The Biggest Gainer started?

2387
03:02:41,137 --> 03:02:41,377
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't know.

2388
03:02:41,397 --> 03:02:41,917
[SPEAKER_14]: I haven't checked.

2389
03:02:42,497 --> 03:02:44,158
[SPEAKER_05]: We haven't done weigh-ins in weeks.

2390
03:02:44,238 --> 03:02:44,498
[SPEAKER_15]: I know.

2391
03:02:44,598 --> 03:02:45,519
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, Extover's not here.

2392
03:02:46,059 --> 03:02:48,200
[SPEAKER_05]: But I've been uber-sick.

2393
03:02:48,460 --> 03:02:48,660
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.

2394
03:02:48,880 --> 03:02:51,021
[SPEAKER_15]: So we'll do another weigh-in next week.

2395
03:02:51,041 --> 03:02:51,901
[SPEAKER_05]: But I win anyway.

2396
03:02:53,001 --> 03:02:53,242
[SPEAKER_15]: I know.

2397
03:02:53,302 --> 03:02:54,262
[SPEAKER_15]: DarkSakura, your final thought.

2398
03:02:55,801 --> 03:02:57,562
[SPEAKER_05]: I hope that I'm over the plague soon.

2399
03:02:57,682 --> 03:03:01,364
[SPEAKER_05]: But the final, the really, really major thing is reject false icons.

2400
03:03:03,004 --> 03:03:06,806
[SPEAKER_15]: My final thought is Velcro bras, the wave of the future.

2401
03:03:08,546 --> 03:03:08,907
That's it.

2402
03:03:09,947 --> 03:03:11,968
[SPEAKER_15]: One word, one word to sum it all up.

2403
03:03:12,008 --> 03:03:14,369
[SPEAKER_15]: The final word of the show, the nail in the coffin.

2404
03:03:14,769 --> 03:03:15,849
[SPEAKER_15]: It is Angel's birthday.

2405
03:03:15,969 --> 03:03:17,370
[SPEAKER_15]: I will let her have the final word.

2406
03:03:17,810 --> 03:03:18,670
[SPEAKER_15]: What is it, my friend?

2407
03:03:18,690 --> 03:03:19,151
[SPEAKER_15]: See you next week.

2408
03:03:19,431 --> 03:03:19,731
[SPEAKER_08]: Brownie!

2409
03:03:21,098 --> 03:03:25,940
[SPEAKER_20]: That does it for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio Live.
