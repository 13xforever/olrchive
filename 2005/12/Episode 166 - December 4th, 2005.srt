00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Oh

3
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:08,000
What's up, what's up, what's up, what's up?

4
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:59,680
attention

5
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:23,680
1, 2, 3, 4!

00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:06,680
The following live program is a special presentation of Orange Lounge Radio.

8
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:43,400
December 4th, 2005.

9
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:47,560
We're going to talk a little bit about what's going on at that game festival that none of

10
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:51,120
us were cool enough to actually go to, but I hear there's a lot of cell phone action

11
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:53,120
going on, so we're going to talk a little bit about that.

12
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:56,880
Of course, how was your week, how was your day, cage match and all that fun stuff you

13
00:04:56,880 --> 00:05:03,880
chatters know and love, so come on board, we'll start right after this.

14
00:05:56,880 --> 00:06:03,880
Orange Lounge may contain adult content, Orange Lounge may contain many four-letter words,

15
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:23,880
Orange Lounge may contain a scene of nudity, Orange Lounge may contain plenty of...

16
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:30,320
Just kidding, Orange Lounge Radio will not contain any of that.

17
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:31,320
In this episode...

18
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:37,760
Why isn't that special?

19
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:48,760

22

You're tuned into Orange Lounge Radio, radio that gamers really want, and this is Orange

through our website, www.orangeloungeradio.com.

27
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:29,240
My name is Rob Roberts, you might know me as Sky.

28
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:31,280
Joining me, as always, are my awesome co-hosts

29
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:33,060
in that corner of the Happiest Bunny on the Farm,

30
00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:35,400
Ms. Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers.

31
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:36,320
I like burritos.

32
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:39,280
That's good.

33
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:41,080
Was it a steak burrito, or was it a veggie burrito?

34
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:43,320
It was a vegetarian burrito.

35
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:44,480
Like beans.

36
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:45,320
And guess what?

37
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:46,160
Beans make me poo.

38
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:48,160
I have a voice lalalalala

39
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:50,160
Congratulations!

40
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:52,160
No hacking tonight.

41
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:54,160
Just because I have codeine in my body.

42
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:56,160
Hooray! Drugs!

43
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:58,160
Yay! I love my opiates!

44
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:01,160
Also joining us, say hello to the other drug fiend, Loki!

45
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:03,160
I hate burritos.

46
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:06,160
You hate burritos? Do they make you poop too?

47
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:08,160
No, I just hate all Mexican food.

48
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:12,160
Except for chips and salsa, but that's kind of borderline.

49
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:22,160
Have you ever had the chips and salsa at Chipotle? Because they have lime chips. Like their chips have just a hint of lime.

50
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:30,160
No. I've been to Sharky's. They have really good chips and salsa. And then just homemade chips and salsa.

51
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:35,160
They have good carnitas at Felipe's by the house.

52
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:38,160
Is that a mom-paw type place, Felipe?

53
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:40,160
Sorta, yeah. But carnitas are yummy.

54
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:42,960
There's a place over here by Target that's owned by Grandma.

55
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:44,920
We call her Grandma because this really old lady owns it.

56
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:45,920
No, she's so sweet.

57
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:46,920
She's always nice to us.

58
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:51,400
She always gives us lots of chips and salsa for free when we go there to do like takeout.

59
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:55,200
And I feel bad because ever since Chipotle opened up, fucking no one goes to Grandma's

60
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,200
anymore.

61
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:57,200
Sad.

62
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:58,200
We should go eat there.

63
00:08:58,200 --> 00:08:59,200
I know we should.

64
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:00,200
Because I love Grandma.

65
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:01,200
She's so sweet.

66
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:02,200
Let's go.

67
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:03,200
Let's go have a staff meeting there.

68
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:06,560
Wait, how do you say Grandma in Spanish?

69
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:07,560
I don't remember.

70
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:08,560
I don't know.

71
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:09,560
I'm sure someone in chat will tell me.

72
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:11,560
Abuelita, is that it?

73
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:40,560
Yeah.

74
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:41,560
Yes.

75
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:46,880
So, everyone's going to scream happy birthday and...

76
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:49,720
By the way guys, I'm using the microphone tonight that sucks.

77
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:51,280
I just want everybody to know.

78
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:54,240
So if I cut in and out, deal with it.

79
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:55,240
Aww.

80
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:56,240
When you cut out, we'll cheer.

81
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:57,240
Shut up.

82
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:58,240
Alright, we're going to take a break.

83
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:00,960
Then we're going to come back and have ourselves a show.

84
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:08,200
Because we want to talk about TDR stuff and there's new videos for 2DX to talk about.

85
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:12,440
There's also new Guitar Freaks V2 and Drummania music.

86
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:14,560
And then there's Dick and Fart Jokes.

87
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:18,280
So we gotta get, as usual, because it wouldn't be a show if we couldn't have some Dick and

88
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:19,280
Fart Jokes.

89
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:20,280
And musical burping.

90
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:23,520
Uh, we'll be back after this, in this break, some Bahmani potpourri.

91
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:28,680
We're gonna start it off with something I do every time I eat a lot of beans.

92
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:30,680
Drop the bomb here on Orange Lounge Radio.

93
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:32,680
D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D

94
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:02,440
The rhythm is the part that you choose, we gotta get with it

95
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:03,920
We're made in the center, you all might try

96
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:05,680
We can do it now, you better snag those colors

97
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:07,180
Yes, already take that ball

98
00:11:07,180 --> 00:11:09,680
You can make me cold, just drop that ball

99
00:11:11,180 --> 00:11:12,680
Yeah, yeah, drop that ball

100
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:15,680
Just drop that ball

101
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:18,680
Let's just keep that ball

102
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:24,680
Yo, you got this build on rhythm

103
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:26,180
If you need the lights, do it some sense

104
00:11:26,180 --> 00:11:27,680
We'll ride the wave to some coffee

105
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:29,680
The rhythm is the part that you choose, we gotta get with it

106
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:32,880
And you're staring all right for me to do it now, you're such a tango scholar

107
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:36,280
You had to erase your face at four, and it's up to you to pick back four

108
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:39,880
You dropped that ball

109
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:43,080
You dropped that ball

110
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:46,280
You dropped that ball

111
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:48,280
Hey, did you drop that bomb?

112
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:50,280
And when I'm on my own

113
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:54,280
You will shine like a star in the eye

114
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:59,280
Play me by your brilliant light

115
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:04,280
Shine your light

116
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:39,780
You've never seen the light shine in your eyes

117
00:13:39,780 --> 00:13:43,280
I'm never on my own

118
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:47,280
You're shining like a star in the sky

119
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:53,280
Made me by your way, I lie

120
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:24,280
1, 2, 3, 4!

121
00:15:47,280 --> 00:16:09,620
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.

122
00:16:09,620 --> 00:16:11,620
You

123
00:16:39,620 --> 00:16:44,620
Orange Lounge Radio. We put your thing down, flip it, and reverse it.

124
00:16:44,620 --> 00:16:52,620
We're back here on Orange Lounge Radio.

125
00:16:52,620 --> 00:16:56,620
Happy December to you all. This is our first show for December.

126
00:16:56,620 --> 00:16:58,620
It's Decemberween!

127
00:16:58,620 --> 00:17:02,620
Have you been naughty or nice this year?

128
00:17:02,620 --> 00:17:06,620
Will Santa be bringing you lots of joy and wonderful gifts this year?

129
00:17:06,620 --> 00:17:12,540
this year or will he be bringing you charcoal? Actually, I found charcoal, little plastic

130
00:17:12,540 --> 00:17:16,060
charcoals filled with candy at Target. Oh, that's cute. That's a cute idea. I'm going

131
00:17:16,060 --> 00:17:20,220
to put some in Dan's stocking. And I thought he brought just real coal, which coal is actually

132
00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:32,180
worth quite a bit from what I hear. My skill in mining has gone up by one point. Angel,

133
00:17:32,180 --> 00:17:36,100
what did you get for your birthday? I was having sex with your cake during the break.

134
00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:45,100
Or, okay, she has this cake thing and it has a big hole in it, so I didn't really, guys, I didn't really have sex with the cake, but I pretended like I was going to have sex with the cake.

135
00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:48,100
And that was my way of frosting it. No, I'm kidding.

136
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:50,100
Naughty, naughty, naughty!

137
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:58,100
I'm so gonna get coal in my stocking. You know what I'm gonna get in my stocking this year? A pig's head. That's what I'm gonna get in my stocking this year.

138
00:17:58,100 --> 00:18:01,100
We're gonna give you a do-it-yourself taxidermy kit.

139
00:18:01,100 --> 00:18:03,100
You should deep fry that thing.

140
00:18:03,100 --> 00:18:07,100
If I get a pig's head, I would so deep-fry it, it'd be badass.

141
00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:12,100
Anyway, I'm sorry, Angel, the birthday girl. How was your birthday? Did you get any presents?

142
00:18:12,100 --> 00:18:14,100
Uh, just this, uh...

143
00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:17,100
That's cute. That's cute, though. I like that.

144
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:20,100
It's a fuse necklace from, well, you can buy it, but thank you.

145
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:30,100
It's like this piece of glass that they've, like, kind of, uh, polished, and they've stuck an LED light in there, and, heh heh, LED.

146
00:18:30,100 --> 00:18:36,940
he bad joke and and and and it like goes through color cycles and stuff so it

147
00:18:36,940 --> 00:18:42,540
goes from blue and then green and then red and then purple or something that's

148
00:18:42,540 --> 00:18:47,660

00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:27,080
mall for like five minutes but most that time was spent trying to find a parking

155
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:32,040
space because my friend really wanted to go and run in and get something and I

156

I'm gonna whack you with a bug net.

00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:57,880
But I could do that in real life.

164
00:19:57,880 --> 00:20:00,880
Well, yeah, you don't live that far from me, do you?

165

Throwing a rock across this highway. Oh, wait. Anyway, yeah.

00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:55,080

181
00:20:57,080 --> 00:20:59,080
fuck you

182
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:01,080
how was your week, how was your day

183
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:03,080
Dark Sakura

184
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:05,080
I spent most of the week having the plague

185
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:08,080
But I decided that it might be the T-Virus.

186
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:11,080
Like, isn't that what AIDS is?

187
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:14,080
No, those are T-Cells.

188
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:18,080
I pity the fool who don't understand the difference.

189
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:23,080
No, the T-Virus was the zombie virus in Resident Evil in the first game.

190
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:29,080
So I figured that if you ever start seeing Itchy Tasty show up on my live journal,

191
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:33,080
like the entry before that would be Ugly Face So Shot Him,

192
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:38,360
then the next one itchy tasty then you'd know that I turned into a zombie and

193
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:42,180
then of course I'd be in here eating everybody's brains are you sniffing my

194
00:21:42,180 --> 00:21:50,340
spicy brains no I wasn't sniffing your spicy brains so um but I did have fun

195
00:21:50,340 --> 00:21:55,100
yesterday because I felt kind of better and I had already made plans so I went

196
00:21:55,100 --> 00:22:03,020
over to our friend Tia's house to make dinner which I made chicken and green

197
00:22:03,020 --> 00:22:05,880
means which I will post pictures of in the chat room because she took pictures

198
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:09,720
of the food I cooked I thought it was sweet and then me and her and her

199
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:13,820
roommate went to the thrift store but on the way there we were sort of like in

200
00:22:13,820 --> 00:22:17,660
the ghetto part of town that we saw Popeyes fried chicken and ate fried

201
00:22:17,660 --> 00:22:24,640
chicken in my car while listening to The Cure fried chicken biscuits with the

202
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:28,960
But I, I'm in love with a chicken wing.

203
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:31,960
No, it's like listening to pictures of you

204
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:36,680
with eating, chowing down on fried chicken.

205
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:39,960
What's that commercial that uses pictures of you?

206
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:45,240
Do I watch TV? I'm asking hypothetically. It's the Kodak, right?

207
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:49,000
No, that's true colors. They show that before the movies, too. No, that was like in the 80s.

208
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,600
That's the last time you probably watched TV.

209
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:55,240
The Kodak thing. They show us the movies too, you know, and they have the

210
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:57,760
pictures of you. I think it is. It might be a digital camera. I don't know.

211
00:22:57,760 --> 00:23:02,120
I don't ever see the camera like that. But I can just imagine like a parody commercial of that, but you and Tia

212
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:03,840
like just chowing down like a

213
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:08,600
rabid pairing of chicken flesh and everything. It'd be great. Dude, we were all three eating that chicken.

214
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:15,000
It was pretty cool. And then we went to the thrift store, which is the picture I just posted in the chat room.

215
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,080
We were all trying on hats.

216
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:19,680
And Tia tried on this nasty wig, so she was all mama's family.

217
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:24,380
And there's another picture of me and her with cowboy hats, which I will post in the chatroom in a moment.

218
00:23:24,380 --> 00:23:28,680
I think that's going to be your new picture on whatever Orange Lawns Radio album art we switch to.

219
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:32,080
No, no, no, no. I have to have the one in the plaid beanie, which I have to go back and buy.

220
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:35,280
The plaid beret thing.

221
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:42,280
Because we're all going to have new pictures. And there's a... Did I even tell you guys about the new intro for the podcast that's coming?

222
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:45,680
Thank you, Rob, for keeping us in the loop and making executive decisions.

223
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:47,680
I totally forgot about it.

224
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:50,680
You said that we could have potentially won, but...

225
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:52,680
That person is doing it, for sure.

226
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:56,680
But we have to screen it when it's done to make sure we like it, of course.

227
00:23:56,680 --> 00:23:57,680
Okay.

228
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:00,680
So you knew!

229
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:03,680
Liar!

230
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:06,680
Oh my god, Jamie's trying to fuck with me! She uses off me!

231
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:08,680
Off of her head! Off of her head! Kill her!

232
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:12,680
But...

233
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:21,360
Yes, I do have a butt. It's very nice. It's very big. Hey! It's times like these you guys

234
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:26,200
are glad we don't have the, uh, OLR webcam. Cause I just showed my butt to Jamie. I didn't

235
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:31,600
show the skin, but I showed... Oh baby, I'm so turned on by your big, gay butt. I'm wearing

236
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:36,640
tight jeans today. Cause my butt did get bigger, therefore my jeans are tighter. Those are

237
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:40,000
actually really nice jeans. I like your very emo-looking holes in your face. Do you like

238
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:45,240
this like the pre razor-bladed emo emo jeans here? I had the coolest jeans though in the

239
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:49,240
80s because you remember during the Samantha Fox days how it was really cool to have all

240
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:55,160
ripped up jeans. Naughty girls need love too. Well I, my mom would not let me cut my jeans

241
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:59,120
I was so pissed off so I went roller skating and I ran into the wall and back then at the

242
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:05,220
roller rink the wall was made out of carpet and I carpet burned the knees out of my jeans

243
00:25:05,220 --> 00:25:08,660
running into the wall and sliding against it.

244
00:25:08,660 --> 00:25:12,320
And I had the biggest rug burn on my knee.

245
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:13,660
It was crazy.

246
00:25:13,660 --> 00:25:17,900
Didn't Samantha Fox also do Let the Music Play? No. What am I getting?

247
00:25:17,900 --> 00:25:20,280
That was, her name was

248
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:21,300
Shannon.

249
00:25:21,300 --> 00:25:22,740
Oh, that's right.

250
00:25:22,740 --> 00:25:26,680
Samantha Fox did, um,

251
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:29,820
crap, now I forgot that other song she did.

252
00:25:29,820 --> 00:25:33,980
She did Naughty Girls Need Love Too and, um,

253
00:25:33,980 --> 00:25:37,980
I forget. Anyway, um, but back to, uh, my life.

254
00:25:37,980 --> 00:25:41,980
Yes, I remember being young in the 80s.

255
00:25:41,980 --> 00:25:45,980
Maybe. Just maybe.

256
00:25:45,980 --> 00:25:49,980
Naughty girls need love too.

257
00:25:53,980 --> 00:25:57,980
It's one of my favorite songs ever.

258
00:25:57,980 --> 00:26:01,980
I do not like big butts. I'm trying to get rid of mine.

259
00:26:01,980 --> 00:26:06,980
Oh my god, well I'll talk about it during my, I made a I like big butts reference this weekend, but anyway, I'm sorry.

260
00:26:06,980 --> 00:26:07,980
I'll get to it later.

261
00:26:07,980 --> 00:26:17,980
I also found out during the whole point in time that I've had my degenerative disease that I dropped something like 16 pounds during the month of November.

262
00:26:17,980 --> 00:26:18,980
Oops.

263
00:26:18,980 --> 00:26:20,980
Because I couldn't eat.

264
00:26:20,980 --> 00:26:24,980
Which is funny because I bet that makes you the biggest loser and you weren't even playing the game.

265
00:26:24,980 --> 00:26:27,980
No, I wasn't.

266
00:26:27,980 --> 00:26:32,860
I also found out that I really like eggnog flavored things like eggnog ice cream because I had some last night

267
00:26:32,860 --> 00:26:38,940
The uh, yeah, the eggnog stuff that they do it like Starbucks and stuff the eggnog lattes. They do this at my work. Oh

268
00:26:39,460 --> 00:26:42,380
Good shit, and and and and and

269
00:26:43,340 --> 00:26:49,420
Eggnog ice cream at Baskin-Robbins. This stuff is the best thing ever because I love ice cream

270
00:26:53,020 --> 00:26:55,020
Excuse me, that was my latte saying hi

271
00:26:55,020 --> 00:26:59,020
Anything else you want to show about your week and your day in the 80s?

272
00:26:59,020 --> 00:27:04,020
Um, I did really shitty homework all day. And then I'm going to, after the show, I'm going to go home and do more.

273
00:27:04,020 --> 00:27:06,020
I just thought I'd let you know.

274
00:27:06,020 --> 00:27:07,020
Okay. What kind of homework?

275
00:27:07,020 --> 00:27:10,020
I have Illustrator this morning, Dreamweaver when I get home.

276
00:27:10,020 --> 00:27:13,020
And I'm going to be doing my geography homework during lunch tomorrow.

277
00:27:13,020 --> 00:27:15,020
Geography.

278
00:27:15,020 --> 00:27:19,020
Ugh, I'm so glad that class is going to be over in two weeks!

279
00:27:19,020 --> 00:27:21,020
And I have jury duty on the 19th.

280
00:27:21,020 --> 00:27:24,440
really if you're taking geography maybe you can answer a question for me is

281
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:32,040
Canada a state or not Canada is a country oh there's a lot of people just

282
00:27:32,040 --> 00:27:36,840
say it's another state has territories I know I'm just I'm just teasing these

283
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:41,240
Canada is a state in the dipshit I just wanted to piss off soccer you know

284
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:46,840
whatever Canadian listeners we have so no did you hear what I just said whoever

285
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:51,780
Whoever says that Canada is a state, whoever legitimately thinks that.

286
00:27:51,780 --> 00:27:53,780
You know there's people out there that think that.

287
00:27:53,780 --> 00:27:55,880
Well they're dipshits.

288
00:27:55,880 --> 00:27:57,820
And Canada's just one big state.

289
00:27:57,820 --> 00:28:01,780
They need to be drug out into the street, and then someone needs to...

290
00:28:01,780 --> 00:28:06,000
The Queen of England is the Governor of Canada.

291
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:09,520
It makes perfect sense that Canada is a state, I mean that's how Alaska's attached to the

292
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:11,760
rest of the United States.

293
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:14,360
They need to be taken out into the middle of the street and then someone needs to get

294
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:18,040
like a big stinky sweat you know sweat sock and then put a tennis ball in it

295
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:23,160
and beat him in the head with it a wet one like fresh from the football players

296
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:29,960
foot I it's just another state where they have you know health care you know

297
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:35,800
I'm teasing of course I'm not that stupid and dirty French people I do have

298
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:41,180
to say having known quite a number of French Canadians during my time of

299
00:28:41,180 --> 00:28:48,060
living immobile and I try not to make generalizations about people I prefer

300
00:28:48,060 --> 00:28:54,140
the French to the French Canadians I think soccer inas from Quebec you're

301
00:28:54,140 --> 00:29:02,000
gonna have I think in general all right you make him cry don't make our listeners

302
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:07,060
cry again don't make the listeners cry again okay that's like the third time

303
00:29:07,060 --> 00:29:14,980
this month and we're only on the fourth you know what what dude okay right Cola

304
00:29:14,980 --> 00:29:22,820
is yummy I know I see their time dude did Canada invent tab because if they

305
00:29:22,820 --> 00:29:30,700
did seriously nuke them I'm actually I was actually suggesting to my well I

306
00:29:30,700 --> 00:29:35,700
wanted to suggest to my husband that we moved to Canada it's cold you'd be cold

307
00:29:35,700 --> 00:29:38,700
I like cold. Your nips will be hard all day.

308
00:29:38,700 --> 00:29:40,700
Bitch!

309
00:29:40,700 --> 00:29:42,700
Don't say it! I like cold!

310
00:29:42,700 --> 00:29:48,700
I'm going to go ahead and say this now. There is the possibility of us moving in a year.

311
00:29:48,700 --> 00:29:50,700
Wow.

312
00:29:50,700 --> 00:29:54,700
That does not mean I will no longer be doing the show.

313
00:29:54,700 --> 00:29:58,700
You'll be freaking rich because the dollar is worth more over there.

314
00:29:58,700 --> 00:30:00,700
I'll just convert all my money.

315
00:30:00,700 --> 00:30:06,700
That's it. That's it. Next Christmas, I'm gonna convert all my money to Canadian dollars and then go shopping and then come back.

316
00:30:07,700 --> 00:30:10,700
We probably have other Canadian listeners who are listening and going,

317
00:30:10,700 --> 00:30:12,700
these people are jerks.

318
00:30:12,700 --> 00:30:17,700
It's all right. We had to make fun of this continent for once, you know, because it's always, you know.

319
00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:19,700
And like, you know what? You know what?

320
00:30:19,700 --> 00:30:23,700
I love Canada because I could get gay married there if I wanted to.

321
00:30:23,700 --> 00:30:29,700
But honestly, if I moved to any country, it's gonna be to the UK.

322
00:30:29,700 --> 00:30:35,700
Because seriously, I am so pissed off at our government.

323
00:30:35,700 --> 00:30:38,700
I hate the situation here.

324
00:30:38,700 --> 00:30:41,700
So hopefully, I'm going to say this publicly on the air.

325
00:30:41,700 --> 00:30:47,700
If any, I want to be hired by zombie flesh eaters, please. Thank you.

326
00:30:47,700 --> 00:30:50,700
Alright. Loki, how was your week? How was your day?

327
00:30:50,700 --> 00:30:56,700
My week was okay. I kicked the crap out of the rest of my colleagues in Granitahto per usual.

328
00:30:56,700 --> 00:31:02,140
And now we're actually going to start keeping stats now, just because I want to know how

329
00:31:02,140 --> 00:31:04,140
badly I'm winning.

330
00:31:04,140 --> 00:31:10,780
And other than that, I've been just waiting for my 360 to come in, talking to people at

331
00:31:10,780 --> 00:31:15,980
GameStop and they haven't even gotten another shipment in, so yay Microsoft!

332
00:31:15,980 --> 00:31:23,860
Meanwhile, Microsoft launched in Europe with less than expected 360s because, you know,

333
00:31:23,860 --> 00:31:27,140
those should have come over here instead of sending them to the UK.

334
00:31:27,140 --> 00:31:28,500
Yeah, we got ours.

335
00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:31,540
It freezes all the time.

336
00:31:31,540 --> 00:31:36,460
Anyways, then I was also waiting for my accessories to show up at my work, and those

337
00:31:36,460 --> 00:31:40,900
still haven't come in either, because Microsoft once again is slow on sending something out.

338
00:31:40,900 --> 00:31:46,540
I swear to God, they just, like, screw everything up. They really don't know what they're doing.

339
00:31:46,540 --> 00:31:49,780
Because, you know, it makes perfect sense. Let's go ahead...

340
00:31:49,780 --> 00:31:53,940
We're really short on units in the United States, let's go ahead and launch it in other

341
00:31:53,940 --> 00:31:57,460
countries so that they're also disappointed in our launch as well.

342
00:31:57,460 --> 00:32:01,540
That'd make perfect sense.

343
00:32:01,540 --> 00:32:04,880
And then what, next week they're going to do Japan and then Japanese just won't give

344
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:08,300
a shit because none of them are buying it?

345
00:32:08,300 --> 00:32:11,940
Actually I hear more people give a shit about Xbox 360 than like the revolution, as I was

346
00:32:11,940 --> 00:32:12,940
reading some...

347
00:32:12,940 --> 00:32:16,660
Yeah, because there's no info about the revolution, the 360's coming out.

348
00:32:16,660 --> 00:32:19,500
So I don't know.

349
00:32:19,500 --> 00:32:31,500
That's why I, boys and girls, we did just have a big-ass net split in our chat room, so folks are dropping like flies, but, you know, life goes on, so just keep trying.

350
00:32:31,500 --> 00:32:41,500
Other than that, that's pretty much the main part of the week. I didn't really do anything of importance other than kick the crap out of my colleagues in Grand Theft Auto.

351
00:32:41,500 --> 00:32:42,500
Can you check that out?

352
00:32:42,500 --> 00:32:44,500
Because I rock.

353
00:32:44,500 --> 00:32:48,500
Yeah, that's about it.

354
00:32:48,500 --> 00:32:54,500
Alright, super. Angel! Angel, Angel, Angel, how was your week? How was your day?

355
00:32:54,500 --> 00:33:03,500
Good. School, grrr. Finals next week, good. Why? Because I get to go... wait, no more.

356
00:33:03,500 --> 00:33:14,500
Well, two weeks, and then school's over, and then I get to go back to my parents' house for like ten days and hang out in the bay.

357
00:33:14,500 --> 00:33:18,500
Uh, so that'll be fun. Um... other than that...

358
00:33:18,500 --> 00:33:23,000
Everybody's leaving for Christmas. I hate Christmas. You know why? Because everybody fucking leaves.

359
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:27,000
You're going to the Bay Area, Shane's going back to Kansas. Who else is leaving?

360
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,000
Who else is leaving for Christmas? Are you leaving for Christmas?

361
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:29,500
No.

362
00:33:29,500 --> 00:33:31,000
Good. Are you leaving for Christmas?

363
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:31,500
No.

364
00:33:31,500 --> 00:33:32,500
Good.

365
00:33:32,500 --> 00:33:34,000
Anyway, yeah, so, I get to do that.

366
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:37,000
You know, I'm gonna go to Canada for Christmas, just to be trendy.

367
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:42,000
Heh. Um... yeah. Oh yeah, World of Warcraft.

368
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:45,000
And we're all on the same server now. That's pretty funny, isn't it?

369
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,000
I refuse to play on that server.

370
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,000
Why?

371
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:52,000
Because I'm already playing on two other servers.

372
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,000
But people are welcome to play with me.

373
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:58,000
It doesn't matter. I barely play World of Warcraft anymore. It's kind of sad.

374
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,000
I do, however, play Dragon Quest.

375
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:03,000
I haven't played a lot of games at all this week, though. Really, it's kind of sad.

376
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:06,000
Yeah, I've just kind of done World of Warcraft when I can.

377
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:10,000
Most of the week's been dedicated to school, so...

378
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:32,000
And then my birthday, so nothing really happened this week, per se, just World of Warcraft when I could, and then homework, and then sleep, and then school, and you know, the regular usual grind. So I've had a very boring week, aside from today, so it's all good.

379
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:38,000
Alright, my week and my day.

380
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:39,000
Pretty good.

381
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:40,000
I had a pretty good week.

382
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:43,960
You know, just really busy, work stuffs and all that good things and I really wasn't getting

383
00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:44,960
a lot of sleep this week.

384
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:48,560
Oh yeah, this was my week where it was like energy drinks kept me through this week and

385
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:51,260
I never drink those energy drinks because they're horrible for you.

386
00:34:51,260 --> 00:34:56,000
Like Ecstafur, who's not here tonight because he's on the road right now, Ecstafur was telling

387
00:34:56,000 --> 00:35:02,280
me about how those energy drinks sent his brother to the hospital, because his brother

388
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:06,760
drank too many of those things, like the buku and the rockstar and all that shit. You gotta

389
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:10,320
be careful with that stuff. Like, use them once in a while if you absolutely need to,

390
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:14,120
but otherwise, that stuff will kill you. Why are your eyes lighting up like his new Christmas

391
00:35:14,120 --> 00:35:17,680
toy, Loki? Your eyes are lighting up like, oh my gosh, I'm so excited, I'm gonna go drink

392
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:24,080
a bunch. Yeah! Cause you wanna go to the hospital? No, I don't like the hospital, but I think

393
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:27,760
I can handle it. I'll drink that with alcohol. That'd be perfect.

394
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:31,080
Well, that's okay. Like Red Bull and vodka, because you don't really drink that much of

395
00:35:31,080 --> 00:35:35,920
it. But like, okay, this is seriously bad, okay? Wednesday, I had a rock star. Thursday,

396
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:41,080
I had a rock star. Friday, I had a rock star. Not good. I should not be drinking that much

397
00:35:41,080 --> 00:35:43,720
energy drinks. You're sounding like Pam Anderson.

398
00:36:13,720 --> 00:36:16,400
especially Red Bull, which looks and tastes like piss.

399
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:20,280
Oh, actually Red Bull to me, now not that I really know what this tastes like, but actually

400
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:22,760
a lesbian told me this, is that Red Bull tastes like pussy.

401
00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:27,440
But it looks like pee. Obviously I don't know this to be true because

402
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:30,680
I've never really eaten pussy because, you know, I am a homosexual.

403
00:36:30,680 --> 00:36:37,480
However, well I did date girls in college and stuff, but you know, I never, you know,

404
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:47,080
that thing uh-huh which involves yeah that part however I've been told by by

405
00:36:47,080 --> 00:36:53,660
a couple lesbians that it indeed tastes like pussy so I I therefore I shouldn't

406
00:36:53,660 --> 00:36:57,480
like Red Bull but I do drink it once a while it's really good with vodka and I

407
00:36:57,480 --> 00:36:59,480
I don't remember where I was going with this.

408
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:01,480
It still looks like piss.

409
00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:05,480
Uh, yeah.

410
00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:07,480
Anyway.

411
00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:09,480
I don't remember where I was going with that. I know.

412
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:11,480
Train derailed. Show derailed.

413
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:13,480
Uh, let's see.

414
00:37:13,480 --> 00:37:15,480
Back on topic. Back on topic.

415
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:17,480
Oh, uh, let's see.

416
00:37:17,480 --> 00:37:19,480
Um, I saw a friend of mine this weekend.

417
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:21,480
A couple of friends of mine

418
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:23,480
this weekend who I hadn't seen in a while.

419
00:37:23,480 --> 00:37:25,480
So that was cool.

420
00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:34,040
and I saw some karaoke revolution partay which was fun and um but karaoke revolution

421
00:37:34,040 --> 00:37:38,840
party is kind of overdone for me now I think I think I've seen too much of it like if I

422
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:44,600
hear another fucking person saying I will always love you I'm going to force them to

423
00:37:44,600 --> 00:37:50,600
drink a gallon of red bull or something because I can't stand to hear people sing those songs

424
00:37:50,600 --> 00:38:02,040
anymore. However, all in all, good times. And I ate a lot of food this weekend. That's

425
00:38:02,040 --> 00:38:08,200
about it. I've been in a mood, I've actually, I have to say, I'm going to be absolutely,

426
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:12,240
absolutely freaking lutely honest. I've had male PMS like all week long. Like I don't

427
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:17,040
know what it is. I suspect, and I probably shouldn't be laughing about this or bringing

428
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:20,480
this up on the show, but I suspect that I'm one of those people that probably gets really

429
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:25,960
affected by the weather, the seasonal disorder, whatever, because seriously, I always get

430
00:38:25,960 --> 00:38:31,680
male PMS in December when the seasons start changing around here. Like always. And so

431
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:36,400
this week I've been kind of PMS-y and I haven't wanted to do a whole lot except nap. So that's

432
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:41,720
the reality. That's not me making shit up for radio. That's the reality is that I really

433
00:38:41,720 --> 00:38:50,440
haven't done a lot this week cuz cuz I've been sad oh I forgot I forgot to

434
00:38:50,440 --> 00:38:55,440
mention I bought another game for the Xbox 360 and make the total of five now

435
00:38:55,440 --> 00:39:01,800
five games for a system I don't own yes I just find that to be redo what are you

436
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:06,080
getting your Xbox 360 have you figured it out yet um I'm thinking sometime

437
00:39:06,080 --> 00:39:14,920
before the apocalypse, um, perhaps... Well, they were telling me, they said, by Christmas,

438
00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:18,920
and they said I was halfway down the list. However, I actually got to see the list, and

439
00:39:18,920 --> 00:39:23,360
I'm not quite halfway down the list. I'm more of, oh, I don't know, five names from the

440
00:39:23,360 --> 00:39:28,160
bottom of the list. You know, it's like, oh, thank you very much. You know, so...

441
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:31,840
Have there been more shipments of Xbox 360 since the first?

442
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:36,420
not uh... game stop elise uh... we can

443
00:39:36,420 --> 00:39:40,060
well i mean like in general yeah but you have some of the works for games uh...

444
00:39:40,060 --> 00:39:43,340
but i'm talking about average joe's here

445
00:39:43,340 --> 00:39:47,200
i mean hell let's let's talk about my boss who you know

446
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:51,820
one of our co-workers you know their boyfriend works for game stop and he

447
00:39:51,820 --> 00:39:55,980
ordered his after mind and he got a large state gee i wonder how that works

448
00:39:55,980 --> 00:39:58,420
we didn't do that

449
00:39:58,420 --> 00:40:00,820
well i know you didn't do that

450
00:40:00,820 --> 00:40:06,820
I'm not talking about you. I'm just saying that, you know, it's impossible to get one.

451
00:40:06,820 --> 00:40:11,640
But anyways, no, they haven't really gotten one, at least not at the GameStop that's by

452
00:40:11,640 --> 00:40:16,700
my house. And I asked them if they had any more shipments since, you know, launch, and

453
00:40:16,700 --> 00:40:21,820
they said they hadn't gotten anything. Maybe next week, maybe whatever. But I don't know

454
00:40:21,820 --> 00:40:26,080
what's taking so long. And they're only making it worse for themselves now that they're launched

455
00:40:26,080 --> 00:40:31,280
in two different countries. I mean, if they didn't have enough units before, they're really

456
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:35,640
not going to have them now. Supposedly there's going to be more Best Buy on the 18th for

457
00:40:35,640 --> 00:40:40,000
their Sunday sale or something like that. They're going to be advertising them again,

458
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:44,000
so I might camp out a couple hours before they open.

459
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:45,000
Dork.

460
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:49,680
Well, I'm just tired. The whole thing is, I'm just, I have these games and I've been

461
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:55,520
waiting you know it'll be you know a couple weeks now for this thing and I'm

462
00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:59,360
just kind of tired of waiting. At $60 a game that's about $300 in games you have right now.

463
00:40:59,360 --> 00:41:07,080
It's all credit. All store credit. I paid not one cent for any of those games. Amazing.

464
00:41:07,080 --> 00:41:13,680
Yeah so I'm not worried about that but the thing is it's just I really kind of

465
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:17,940
want the system now since I've paid for it and you know waiting at you know

466
00:41:17,940 --> 00:41:22,300
GameStop, it's going to take me forever, even if they do get another shipment in, I'm not

467
00:41:22,300 --> 00:41:26,440
going to be on that shipment, so I've got to wait. And I'll be waiting until next year.

468
00:41:26,440 --> 00:41:32,200
By that time, hell, my work will have them then. It's just retarded. So, I might as well

469
00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:38,940
just go ahead and pick one up at GameStop, or Best Buy or whatever, and then just cancel

470
00:41:38,940 --> 00:41:41,620
my pre-order there and get my money back.

471
00:41:41,620 --> 00:41:45,700
I think we should go and kick Microsoft in the balls for what they're doing with this.

472
00:41:45,700 --> 00:41:47,700
I mean, seriously, this is stupid.

473
00:41:47,700 --> 00:41:52,740
And then they keep advertising their system and stuff. They're not in fucking stores, you morons.

474
00:41:52,740 --> 00:41:54,480
I mean, I haven't seen

475
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:58,660
any Xbox 360 in stores now. No, they're not.

476
00:41:58,660 --> 00:42:01,160
It's not around, and

477
00:42:01,160 --> 00:42:03,440
their whole marketing is retarded.

478
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:05,300
They really need to just

479
00:42:05,300 --> 00:42:08,980
stop. They should have. This whole worldwide launch is the most retarded thing.

480
00:42:08,980 --> 00:42:10,540
Okay, first off,

481
00:42:10,540 --> 00:42:14,820
they can't really say, oh yeah, we did a worldwide launch. No, you didn't.

482
00:42:14,820 --> 00:42:20,380
fail at that so you can't even you know hold that above everyone else's heads

483
00:42:20,380 --> 00:42:24,780
they should just launched in one country at first a couple months later launch

484
00:42:24,780 --> 00:42:28,900
another country and later another country poor Australia I mean that's

485
00:42:28,900 --> 00:42:33,460
kind of giving you an idea when units are actually going to be in stores March

486
00:42:33,460 --> 00:42:38,340
I mean they better hope that Sony isn't like oh yeah we're gonna be able to

487
00:42:38,340 --> 00:42:47,580
launch in a couple months, you know, with our PS3. So, it's just, it's ridiculous. That's

488
00:42:47,580 --> 00:43:00,580
all I got. Earth to rub. Sorry. We're going to go break. When we come back from break,

489
00:43:00,580 --> 00:43:05,880
we're going to open up the Skypline and your comments because it's not broken this week

490
00:43:05,880 --> 00:43:10,760
and we'll have that. So we'll be back

491
00:43:10,760 --> 00:43:13,960
after this mix of

492
00:43:13,960 --> 00:43:18,360
music from various bimani games. Won't that be fun?

493
00:43:18,360 --> 00:43:21,560
We'll be back with more Orange Lounge Radio and other

494
00:43:21,560 --> 00:43:28,560
news and some movie time, hopefully.

495
00:43:51,560 --> 00:43:55,560
He knew he had to try to let love in

496
00:43:55,560 --> 00:43:57,560
My mother let her know

497
00:43:57,560 --> 00:43:59,560
She was in the mood for talking

498
00:43:59,560 --> 00:44:02,560
But when he began to play the game

499
00:44:02,560 --> 00:44:06,560
Before he knew it he had told her how much he'd been hurting

500
00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:09,560
How he was hoping she was not the same

501
00:44:09,560 --> 00:44:13,560
Could you see the kind of way the family can

502
00:44:13,560 --> 00:44:16,560
After all of this time, could this be true love?

503
00:44:16,560 --> 00:44:20,560
And he said, boy, you don't have to love no more

504
00:44:20,560 --> 00:44:24,560
I'll give the love you need, do you holler in the guarantee?

505
00:44:24,560 --> 00:44:27,560
I'd like to rest, for I'm a fine lady

506
00:44:27,560 --> 00:44:30,560
You've been hard, but peaceful, but I am the cure

507
00:44:30,560 --> 00:44:34,560
And when you wake up late, thinking it's a dream

508
00:44:34,560 --> 00:44:37,560
The best day boy you know, you can count on me

509
00:44:37,560 --> 00:44:38,560
Believe me

510
00:44:38,560 --> 00:44:41,560
This lady, you know what she found in me

511
00:44:41,560 --> 00:44:43,560
Is a lady, kind of lady

512
00:44:43,560 --> 00:44:45,560
That can give you what you need

513
00:44:45,560 --> 00:44:46,560
Baby, a kind of lady

514
00:44:46,560 --> 00:44:48,560
That will never leave you lonely

515
00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:50,160
The lonely end of the neighborhood

516
00:44:50,160 --> 00:44:51,160
This little lady

517
00:44:51,160 --> 00:44:52,660
Finally found me your kind

518
00:44:52,660 --> 00:44:53,660
Look at me

519
00:44:56,960 --> 00:44:58,960
Keep the camera, keep the camera

520
00:45:00,360 --> 00:45:02,360
Keep the camera, keep the camera

521
00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:05,760
Keep the camera, keep the camera

522
00:45:07,060 --> 00:45:10,060
Keep the camera

523
00:45:14,060 --> 00:45:15,560
Bouncing in the moonlight

524
00:45:15,560 --> 00:45:17,460
You're dancing in the shadow

525
00:45:17,460 --> 00:45:19,460
We sing of the dream of the dream

526
00:45:20,460 --> 00:45:23,460
Night is the moment of self-infusion

527
00:45:24,460 --> 00:45:26,460
Things ever are what they seem

528
00:45:27,460 --> 00:45:30,460
The moon and the stars are a double creation

529
00:45:31,460 --> 00:45:33,460
The only reality's you and me

530
00:45:34,460 --> 00:45:37,460
The stars of your lips would be such a sensation

531
00:45:38,460 --> 00:45:40,460
So sweet my angel

532
00:45:41,460 --> 00:45:44,460
Give it to me all through the night

533
00:45:44,460 --> 00:45:48,000
You can't be scared to say it. And you say it.

534
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:51,480
You've got to say it till the morning.

535
00:45:51,480 --> 00:45:55,680
You can't be scared. Can you hear it?

536
00:45:55,680 --> 00:45:59,640
Shake my tongue.

537
00:45:59,640 --> 00:46:03,240
Shake my tongue.

538
00:46:03,240 --> 00:46:06,500
Shake my tongue.

539
00:46:06,500 --> 00:46:10,020
Shake my tongue.

540
00:46:10,020 --> 00:46:12,160
Shake my tongue.

541
00:46:12,160 --> 00:46:14,160
You've got to be a girl

542
00:48:12,160 --> 00:48:14,160
Okay, let's go!

543
00:48:14,160 --> 00:48:16,160
Good job!

544
00:48:44,160 --> 00:48:45,160
Let's do it!

545
00:48:47,660 --> 00:48:49,160
Let's do it!

546
00:49:19,160 --> 00:49:26,160
Hi Ho, Kermit the Frog here, informing you that today's broadcast is going to be about

547
00:49:49,160 --> 00:49:54,320
of Orange Lounge Radio is brought to you by the letter B, the letter A, and the number

548
00:49:54,320 --> 00:49:55,320
59.

549
00:49:55,320 --> 00:49:59,960
Can you tell me how to get, how to get to Sesame Street?

550
00:49:59,960 --> 00:50:05,080
We're back here on Orange Lounge Radio and before the break we were talking a little

551
00:50:05,080 --> 00:50:08,920
bit about our weeks and our days and now of course we need to get into talking a little

552
00:50:08,920 --> 00:50:14,000
bit about what's going on with those music games we know and love and adore.

553
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:19,380
And I'm hearing that there's some pretty big news going on with Beatmania US, the buddy

554
00:50:19,380 --> 00:50:22,600
of mine in chat telling me about this, I'm going to see if I can get him to call in in

555
00:50:22,600 --> 00:50:25,120
a little bit.

556
00:50:25,120 --> 00:50:26,640
But I guess some big stuff going on.

557
00:50:26,640 --> 00:50:28,720
I heard that the game festival was this weekend, right?

558
00:50:28,720 --> 00:50:31,920
That was the big festival that went on in San Francisco where they had a bunch of games

559
00:50:31,920 --> 00:50:32,920
that were being shown.

560
00:50:32,920 --> 00:50:38,520
It was like, it was kind of like E3 but the X Games or something.

561
00:50:38,520 --> 00:50:42,440
So I don't know how to explain it, what they were doing.

562
00:50:42,440 --> 00:50:46,920
But apparently Beatmania didn't show up the first day because of a really stupid mistake,

563
00:50:46,920 --> 00:50:51,400
not on Konami's end but on some festival planning end, so they didn't have Beatmania USA the

564
00:50:51,400 --> 00:50:52,400
first day.

565
00:50:52,400 --> 00:50:55,720
But I think it did finally make an appearance this weekend, so we probably know a little

566
00:50:55,720 --> 00:51:00,520
bit more about it, so I'm going to see if we can get somebody who might have been there

567
00:51:00,520 --> 00:51:03,080
to tell us a little more about it first hand.

568
00:51:03,080 --> 00:51:08,200
However, we do have news about what's going on with Beatmania over in Japan.

569
00:51:08,200 --> 00:51:16,140
at 2DX 13th style, also known as beginning 2DX distorted, because I think they are going

570
00:51:16,140 --> 00:51:22,120
back to saying 2DX 13, but they're still not saying, you know, 13th style or anything,

571
00:51:22,120 --> 00:51:26,160
so whatever you want to call it, distorted I guess would be the official name. They're

572
00:51:26,160 --> 00:51:31,560
actually location testing right now, and some folks snuck in a camera, and you know, this

573
00:51:31,560 --> 00:51:36,020
is like a high security place, and you know, these kids could probably get arrested for

574
00:51:36,020 --> 00:51:39,540
what they're doing but to bring joy to us all they snuck a camera in there and

575
00:51:39,540 --> 00:51:42,980
recorded some of what was going on on the location test and some of the songs

576
00:51:42,980 --> 00:51:46,780
and I hear now I haven't seen this but I hear that there's a pretty awesome video

577
00:51:46,780 --> 00:51:52,860
for a new song called star or some sorry not star field a sun field which you

578
00:51:52,860 --> 00:51:56,580
know obviously the name sounds an awful lot like star field but there's a pretty

579
00:51:56,580 --> 00:52:01,380
awesome video and one of our chatters Siggy suggested that we watch it so I

580
00:52:01,380 --> 00:52:05,780
said sure why not let's watch it so here it is we're gonna do a little bit of

581
00:52:05,780 --> 00:52:09,980
Orange Lawn's Movie Time. This is the location test for Sunfield. And you guys might be able

582
00:52:09,980 --> 00:52:16,980
to hear a little bit of the song in the background here.

583
00:52:39,980 --> 00:52:49,980
This definitely sounds nothing like Starfield.

584
00:52:49,980 --> 00:52:52,980
It's a BABYTRAN!

585
00:52:52,980 --> 00:53:01,980
This little baby verse of Tran sitting there with all these colored spheres flying around.

586
00:53:01,980 --> 00:53:03,980
Oh, and look at that little beach ball!

587
00:53:04,980 --> 00:53:06,980
And now baby Tran has passed out.

588
00:53:07,980 --> 00:53:08,980
It's falling.

589
00:53:09,980 --> 00:53:13,980
The camera was about to go up her ass, so that was not necessary.

590
00:53:13,980 --> 00:53:15,980
And so Tran had a beach ball.

591
00:53:15,980 --> 00:53:18,980
Oh, there's little Tran right on the beach ball. That's cute. I like that.

592
00:53:19,980 --> 00:53:21,980
Thought I looked like it. That was pretty excellent.

593
00:53:21,980 --> 00:53:23,980
Oh, hey! Tran's all grown up now.

594
00:53:24,980 --> 00:53:27,980
There's Tran. He's got a ball.

595
00:53:27,980 --> 00:53:33,980
And now Tran is flying on a colored something.

596
00:53:33,980 --> 00:53:35,980
There's a Walker! There's a Walker!

597
00:53:35,980 --> 00:53:37,980
Oh, gee.

598
00:53:37,980 --> 00:53:39,980
Is that a baby?

599
00:53:39,980 --> 00:53:41,980
Oh, is that a mommy Tran? A baby Tran?

600
00:53:41,980 --> 00:53:43,980
Oh, I get it.

601
00:53:43,980 --> 00:53:45,980
Here, play with your head.

602
00:53:47,980 --> 00:53:49,980
Time to change the diaper, baby Tran.

603
00:53:49,980 --> 00:53:51,980
Yay!

604
00:53:53,980 --> 00:53:55,980
Now back to the words I can't read.

605
00:53:55,980 --> 00:53:58,980
Driving into a smile.

606
00:53:58,980 --> 00:54:00,980
EGRID!

607
00:54:05,980 --> 00:54:07,980
I thought there was a lyric in the song.

608
00:54:07,980 --> 00:54:08,980
Happening this time.

609
00:54:08,980 --> 00:54:10,980
Something driving into a smile.

610
00:54:10,980 --> 00:54:12,980
That's a terrible thing to say.

611
00:54:18,980 --> 00:54:20,980
We're learning a cute video.

612
00:54:20,980 --> 00:54:27,980
Oh, look at that. You can almost see the reflection of the guy. We're gonna go have him arrested.

613
00:54:27,980 --> 00:54:34,980
That was cute. I like that. The video to iFutureList, which is over on that computer somewhere,

614
00:54:34,980 --> 00:54:38,080
the other extraterrestrial computer, it's pretty cool because you can actually see a

615
00:54:38,080 --> 00:54:42,180
Kiryamoka like really well in the video, and I just remember like, let me describe the

616
00:54:42,180 --> 00:54:50,280
video like this. One word. Shades. I swear to God, that was like a part of the video

617
00:54:50,280 --> 00:54:56,440
that stuck out in my mind. It was great. Anyway, check that out boys and girls.

618
00:54:56,440 --> 00:55:04,600
Those location test videos are posted over on BomaniStyle. So you can go

619
00:55:04,600 --> 00:55:08,000
check that out if you want. We post them on our website, but that's not really our

620
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:12,040
thing. We don't want to tread on somebody else's territory, and the

621
00:55:12,040 --> 00:55:19,040
The pirating of 2DX videos has always been Bomani-style's forte, so have at it.

622
00:55:19,040 --> 00:55:22,880
Alright, we're going to open up the Skype line, boys and girls.

623
00:55:22,880 --> 00:55:27,440
I'm sure you kids want to call us and let us know what's going on.

624
00:55:27,440 --> 00:55:28,440
So the Skype line's open.

625
00:55:28,440 --> 00:55:29,440
Give us a call.

626
00:55:29,440 --> 00:55:30,440
Hello, you're on Orange Lawn's radio.

627
00:55:30,440 --> 00:55:31,440
Hello?

628
00:55:31,440 --> 00:55:32,440
Hello?

629
00:55:32,440 --> 00:55:33,440
You're on Orange Lawn's radio.

630
00:55:33,440 --> 00:55:34,440
Well, hello there.

631
00:55:34,440 --> 00:55:35,440
Okay, I think I can get to you.

632
00:55:35,440 --> 00:55:37,440
Hello? Y'all don't know what it sounds like on the radio.

633
00:55:37,440 --> 00:55:39,440
Well hello there.

634
00:55:39,440 --> 00:55:42,440
Okay, I think I can catch you now.

635
00:55:42,440 --> 00:55:43,440
Can you hear us?

636
00:55:43,440 --> 00:55:45,440
Yes, I can hear you.

637
00:55:45,440 --> 00:55:47,440
And who might this be?

638
00:55:47,440 --> 00:55:50,440
Oh, you're speaking to the one and only Mel-to-the-bizzle.

639
00:55:50,440 --> 00:55:55,440
Hello Mel-to-the-bizzle. How are you Mel-bizzle, Mr. Bizzle?

640
00:55:55,440 --> 00:56:00,440
Yes, yes, okay, you're just a little, you're a little bit intermittent in and out there, but.

641
00:56:00,440 --> 00:56:04,440
That's because Loki is downloading porn on the other computer.

642
00:56:04,440 --> 00:56:09,580
I am not doing any of that. He's downloading lots and lots of pornography and it's messing

643
00:56:09,580 --> 00:56:14,460
up our bandwidth. Yeah, I'm not surprised that Splooge is getting

644
00:56:14,460 --> 00:56:20,360
through the tubes of connection right now. Well, what's going on? How was the game festival?

645
00:56:20,360 --> 00:56:23,640
You went to the game festival, right? How was it?

646
00:56:23,640 --> 00:56:28,020
Well, it was pretty cool, you know, game and music experience, but I think, and I know

647
00:56:28,020 --> 00:56:32,560
you can definitely feel where I'm coming from when I say this, if you've been to E3, it's

648
00:56:32,560 --> 00:56:36,060
It's kind of like going to Vegas, you know, like, of video gaming.

649
00:56:36,060 --> 00:56:39,820
Everything's out there, it's so grandiose, you know, it's the whole nine.

650
00:56:39,820 --> 00:56:43,460
When you go to a game, it's kind of like taking a site trip to Reno.

651
00:56:43,460 --> 00:56:50,380
It's like going to Reno, yeah, I definitely hear that.

652
00:56:50,380 --> 00:56:54,100
Did you see any cool new things there at the Game and Music Experience, or whatever the

653
00:56:54,100 --> 00:56:55,100
hell it was called?

654
00:56:55,100 --> 00:56:58,340
There's a couple, yeah, the Game and Music Experience, there were a couple new things.

655
00:56:58,340 --> 00:57:02,860
I mean, I know most of the Orange Realms radio people want to hear about 2DX, and I think

656
00:57:02,860 --> 00:57:05,540
you kind of got the scoop that 2DX wasn't there until like today.

657
00:57:05,540 --> 00:57:06,860
Yeah, I heard about that.

658
00:57:06,860 --> 00:57:11,340
Yeah, well, I have to blow the scoop without knowing if you heard the full story, but essentially,

659
00:57:11,340 --> 00:57:15,260
first off, Friday, they didn't even put the freaking ROM in the display case.

660
00:57:15,260 --> 00:57:17,500
Granted, for a matter, this is games doing this.

661
00:57:17,500 --> 00:57:19,980
Konami and like all the other companies, they're not running their own boots.

662
00:57:19,980 --> 00:57:23,620
This is like all done by union members, and you know, like they really know about video

663
00:57:23,620 --> 00:57:24,620
games.

664
00:57:24,620 --> 00:57:28,100
So putting a lot of trust in people, and then them fucking it up, basically.

665
00:57:28,100 --> 00:57:32,940
Yeah, so, okay, so anyway, Jason, you know, he wasn't even going to be there this weekend,

666
00:57:32,940 --> 00:57:33,940
Jason, you know?

667
00:57:33,940 --> 00:57:36,580
But he comes down and he's like, you know, what the F is going on?

668
00:57:36,580 --> 00:57:41,420
And so we talked to the, you know, coordinator, and then they say, yeah, we can't find a ROM.

669
00:57:41,420 --> 00:57:43,020
Well, it's like, okay, great.

670
00:57:43,020 --> 00:57:46,580
Not only is our game not being displayed, but now, you know, there's a loose ROM and

671
00:57:46,580 --> 00:57:47,580
this could be some serious trouble.

672
00:57:47,580 --> 00:57:53,580
So Jason has to run back down to Konami, get the ROM, and get, like, a debug PS2, and,

673
00:57:53,580 --> 00:57:58,020
you know, bring that back up, like, Friday, like, at midnight or so, so, like, Saturday,

674
00:57:58,020 --> 00:58:00,020
We figured we were going to have everything up and running.

675
00:58:00,020 --> 00:58:04,520
Well, the geniuses that ran the whole place, you know, put in the ROM this time,

676
00:58:04,520 --> 00:58:08,520
but they used their own PS2, and not the one that Jason brought.

677
00:58:08,520 --> 00:58:11,520
So what happened was, you could play the game all the way up to select a song.

678
00:58:11,520 --> 00:58:13,520
When you select a song, the thing flows.

679
00:58:13,520 --> 00:58:17,020
And when the thing flows, people thought, oh great, this is, you know, a bugged ROM.

680
00:58:17,020 --> 00:58:19,020
This is going to be the best game ever.

681
00:58:19,020 --> 00:58:23,020
This is going to be the best game ever is what they were thinking.

682
00:58:23,020 --> 00:58:25,520
Yeah, so anyway, yeah.

683
00:58:25,520 --> 00:58:28,520
So that's a bug. And then Jason comes up and says, what the hell is going on?

684
00:58:28,520 --> 00:58:31,520
Finds out that they didn't use the PST that he gave them.

685
00:58:31,520 --> 00:58:36,520
And so he didn't get it up and running until like about 10 o'clock last night, which is essentially the time game closed.

686
00:58:36,520 --> 00:58:41,520
So it was finally up and running this morning, and I finally got to get a sneak peek in.

687
00:58:41,520 --> 00:58:46,520
I got a few like of the inside things that most people don't know about just by looking at BeatMania.

688
00:58:46,520 --> 00:58:48,520
Tell us, tell us, tell us.

689
00:58:48,520 --> 00:58:50,520
Tell us what?

690
00:58:50,520 --> 00:58:51,520
Tell us, tell us.

691
00:58:51,520 --> 00:58:53,520
Don't hold back anymore. Tell us what's going on.

692
00:58:53,520 --> 00:58:59,600
OK, so, alright, so, um, 2DX, you know, I got to check that out, um, the build looked

693
00:58:59,600 --> 00:59:02,960
a lot like, um, you know, 9th style, pretty much like what you see, it looked a little

694
00:59:02,960 --> 00:59:03,960
cleaner this time.

695
00:59:03,960 --> 00:59:09,120
As far as song lists, they didn't reveal a whole heck of a lot, because, you know, of

696
00:59:09,120 --> 00:59:12,920
course they still want to keep a lot of their stuff under wraps, there's a lot of new songs

697
00:59:12,920 --> 00:59:17,400
that he said, but, um, it's kind of cool the way they set it up, because, like, you know

698
00:59:17,400 --> 00:59:21,760
how BeatMe is supposed to have 5-key and 7-key, um, functionality?

699
00:59:21,760 --> 00:59:25,760
The way you like it is select screen, you can either choose BeatMania or BeatMania 2DX.

700
00:59:25,760 --> 00:59:29,120
So that's kind of like a neat little spin on that.

701
00:59:29,120 --> 00:59:32,240
And one little spin that, I don't know if anyone's mentioned this or not, but one thing

702
00:59:32,240 --> 00:59:37,920
that America does have, actually let's keep, well actually before we get to that, another

703
00:59:37,920 --> 00:59:42,760
thing they keep is they actually use Happy Sky naming conventions now, so now things

704
00:59:42,760 --> 00:59:49,160
are like beginner or easy or hyper and then, you know, hard, so I thought that was a neat

705
00:59:49,160 --> 00:59:50,160
split.

706
00:59:50,160 --> 00:59:56,480
The main thing that I heard that was confirmed was you notice how like when you watch hot

707
00:59:56,480 --> 00:59:59,920
bitches videos or like you know you play a song and you AAA it and you think oh man how

708
00:59:59,920 --> 01:00:03,040
can I prove to people I did this besides the score?

709
01:00:03,040 --> 01:00:07,560
TDX USA will be offering a you can save your replays.

710
01:00:07,560 --> 01:00:11,400
Wow, so you can save replays of songs.

711
01:00:11,400 --> 01:00:13,400
Are you going to be able to do anything with the internet?

712
01:00:13,400 --> 01:00:14,400
Yes.

713
01:00:14,400 --> 01:00:15,400
Yes?

714
01:00:15,400 --> 01:00:16,400
What's that?

715
01:00:16,400 --> 01:00:19,400
Are you going to be able to do anything with the internet?

716
01:00:20,400 --> 01:00:22,400
That wasn't mentioned.

717
01:00:22,400 --> 01:00:24,400
Oh, okay.

718
01:00:25,400 --> 01:00:33,400
I don't know about internet online play, but I do know that instant replays of your in-game are available.

719
01:00:34,400 --> 01:00:36,400
Very interesting.

720
01:00:37,400 --> 01:00:39,400
Yeah, you know, there were a couple of them.

721
01:00:39,400 --> 01:00:43,400
We were talking about the Konami style, like the new US controller.

722
01:00:43,400 --> 01:00:48,120
Because, the thing was, they didn't have it on display at games that weekend, because

723
01:00:48,120 --> 01:00:53,720
essentially, A, it felt like a little bit, you know, getting tested out and stuff, and

724
01:00:53,720 --> 01:00:59,120
B, they didn't want to get it jacked or broken, and you know how, like, when you go to a place

725
01:00:59,120 --> 01:01:03,720
that's open to the public, you know, TVX will get, I mean, come on, Roseville Golf Land,

726
01:01:03,720 --> 01:01:04,720
that's sad.

727
01:01:04,720 --> 01:01:05,720
Yeah.

728
01:01:05,720 --> 01:01:06,720
Gotcha.

729
01:01:06,720 --> 01:01:07,720
Okay.

730
01:01:07,720 --> 01:01:08,720
All right, so let's see.

731
01:01:08,720 --> 01:01:11,760
Yeah, so, I mean, we've got to talk to you about it, and it's like, apparently, you know,

732
01:01:11,760 --> 01:01:13,960
according to like some of the people who have played it,

733
01:01:13,960 --> 01:01:15,240
you know, from what he said,

734
01:01:15,240 --> 01:01:17,600
the controller feels a little bit, you know,

735
01:01:17,600 --> 01:01:20,160
it looks a lot sleeker, it's lighter.

736
01:01:20,160 --> 01:01:22,320
The keys aren't exactly like the Konami style

737
01:01:22,320 --> 01:01:24,080
where they're absolute like clicky-clicky,

738
01:01:24,080 --> 01:01:26,480
but from what I heard, they feel a lot better

739
01:01:26,480 --> 01:01:27,960
and they don't like stick.

740
01:01:29,080 --> 01:01:32,440
So they don't so much click, but they don't stick

741
01:01:32,440 --> 01:01:35,000
like the old controller does so much?

742
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:36,320
They have a little bit more click

743
01:01:36,320 --> 01:01:38,520
than the like normal home-style controllers,

744
01:01:38,520 --> 01:01:40,680
but not as much like total, you know, perfect click,

745
01:01:40,680 --> 01:01:43,680
actually an arcade style.

746
01:01:43,680 --> 01:01:48,320
Okay, okay. Now, Loki brought up a picture in here in the studio

747
01:01:48,320 --> 01:01:52,760
of some, I think this is an ad, an ad for Beatmania, and you can clearly see this

748
01:01:52,760 --> 01:01:53,880
controller

749
01:01:53,880 --> 01:01:57,280
is rounded on the side. That's the cover shot.

750
01:01:57,280 --> 01:01:59,520
That's the cover shot of the game.

751
01:01:59,520 --> 01:02:01,120
And are you going to be able to flip,

752
01:02:01,120 --> 01:02:04,360
well, I guess you could still do the flip around the controller thing for

753
01:02:04,360 --> 01:02:06,020
either side.

754
01:02:06,020 --> 01:02:07,480
As far as I know, yeah, you can flip it.

755
01:02:07,480 --> 01:02:10,960
but it's weird because it's it's rounded on one side now it's not a completely

756
01:02:10,960 --> 01:02:14,240
rectangular controller it looks like uh...

757
01:02:14,240 --> 01:02:15,440
finger

758
01:02:15,440 --> 01:02:20,920
it's kinda rounded on one side so that's interesting

759
01:02:20,920 --> 01:02:21,760
alright

760
01:02:21,760 --> 01:02:26,340
anything else you want to share about what was going on with BeatMania?

761
01:02:26,340 --> 01:02:30,360
uh... let me think uh... as far as like five key songs and seven key songs

762
01:02:30,360 --> 01:02:34,440
i don't know i can't remember what the E3 list was like but as far as like five key songs

763
01:02:34,440 --> 01:02:41,440
I remember seeing, like, Hunting For You, Bossa Nova de Fabian, they had Battle Breaks,

764
01:02:41,440 --> 01:02:43,440
which I didn't see at E3.

765
01:02:43,440 --> 01:02:44,440
Okay, cool.

766
01:02:44,440 --> 01:02:50,000
Yeah, Battle Breaks, what else was there, Metal Gear, Salting, Paranoia Max, so yeah,

767
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:54,160
that was kind of the default list, almost, for E3, except maybe like one or two songs.

768
01:02:54,160 --> 01:02:58,920
R7 Key, the hardest song I saw was Shining Polaris, so I thought I had E3 also, but they

769
01:02:58,920 --> 01:03:00,680
also have like the M Steps.

770
01:03:00,680 --> 01:03:05,160
It's that song from, it's style like, is it your fifth or no sixth style, it's the Shochiro

771
01:03:05,160 --> 01:03:11,080
Hirata song, that's like the two step song, oh the M Step 2 one, yeah I know what you're

772
01:03:11,080 --> 01:03:12,080
talking about, okay.

773
01:03:12,080 --> 01:03:17,560
Yeah they had that song, they had um, they had GMD on there which is surprising, the

774
01:03:17,560 --> 01:03:25,880
GMD okay, oh wow okay, yeah complicated like trigonometry, that was like third style wasn't

775
01:03:25,880 --> 01:03:30,560
it, that's an old song, I know yeah and the cool thing was they kept a lot of the 2DX

776
01:03:30,560 --> 01:03:35,760
those crossed over to this version, so like, you know, GMB with the pop locker and the

777
01:03:35,760 --> 01:03:38,080
breaker, yeah, you get to see that on there.

778
01:03:38,080 --> 01:03:40,240
Now were the Anothers there or not?

779
01:03:40,240 --> 01:03:42,440
That's what they're asking in chat.

780
01:03:42,440 --> 01:03:48,360
Um, Anothers, I can't remember, I tried to play like sharing Polaris with Another, but

781
01:03:48,360 --> 01:03:51,960
I can't remember if it was or not, you know, because I haven't played that song in a long

782
01:03:51,960 --> 01:03:52,960
time.

783
01:03:52,960 --> 01:03:57,920
But as far as I know, well, from what Jason had told me, as far as Anothers, I heard it's

784
01:03:57,920 --> 01:04:03,920
It might be something you have to unlock.

785
01:04:03,920 --> 01:04:06,920
It might be an unlock feature then, okay.

786
01:04:06,920 --> 01:04:07,920
Yeah.

787
01:04:07,920 --> 01:04:13,920
Did you see any of the DJ art, the goalie art, the art that shows up when you beat songs?

788
01:04:13,920 --> 01:04:14,920
What was it?

789
01:04:14,920 --> 01:04:19,920
Did you see any of the art, the artwork, the DJs on the completion screen?

790
01:04:19,920 --> 01:04:23,920
They didn't have any artwork, like when you get the certain gallery unlocks.

791
01:04:23,920 --> 01:04:26,920
No, I did not see that at the time, they just only had the stat screen.

792
01:04:26,920 --> 01:04:30,920
But that may still be a work in progress.

793
01:04:30,920 --> 01:04:33,920
Yeah, it's still a work in progress, you never know.

794
01:04:33,920 --> 01:04:37,920
I mean, I hear, like, well, the one thing that somewhat disappointed me was, um, 5-speed

795
01:04:37,920 --> 01:04:42,920
beat mania doesn't have their old, like, you know, 16-bit or whatever, like the, you know,

796
01:04:42,920 --> 01:04:44,920
those little block type videos.

797
01:04:44,920 --> 01:04:46,920
Yeah, the old style videos.

798
01:04:46,920 --> 01:04:52,920
But they, you know, kind of managed to make it a little more sleeker and, like, more or

799
01:04:52,920 --> 01:04:54,920
less, you know, recreate some of that stuff.

800
01:04:54,920 --> 01:05:01,160
I hear some songs get absolute total new video makeovers, but there really isn't any on which

801
01:05:01,160 --> 01:05:07,200
ones or just yet.

802
01:05:07,200 --> 01:05:09,800
That pretty much sums up 2DX.

803
01:05:09,800 --> 01:05:13,760
What I'll probably do is I'll post on Orange Mountains a full song list that I did see

804
01:05:13,760 --> 01:05:20,280
there because I have it on my video camcorder.

805
01:05:20,280 --> 01:05:25,960
I think that pretty much sums up 2DX at the game for today, you know, like I said, a lot

806
01:05:25,960 --> 01:05:29,760
of stuff I was able to try out with Jason just, you know, kind of, you know, because

807
01:05:29,760 --> 01:05:33,200
he wasn't really there to, like, answer questions or anything.

808
01:05:33,200 --> 01:05:34,200
Right.

809
01:05:34,200 --> 01:05:35,200
Okay.

810
01:05:35,200 --> 01:05:38,540
Well, I mean, that's pretty cool, though.

811
01:05:38,540 --> 01:05:42,760
I guess maybe it might have been out there about the recording thing.

812
01:05:42,760 --> 01:05:43,760
It was hidden.

813
01:05:43,760 --> 01:05:46,920
Somebody in their chat room was saying it was kind of hidden on the Music of a New Year

814
01:05:46,920 --> 01:05:48,920
It's actually hidden and it's listed right on there.

815
01:05:48,920 --> 01:05:50,920
Is it? But I didn't know about that before.

816
01:05:50,920 --> 01:05:53,920
Yeah, it says right on there, it's under game overview, it says...

817
01:05:53,920 --> 01:05:54,920
What happened?

818
01:05:54,920 --> 01:05:57,920
I guess that recording thing has been known. I didn't know that, though.

819
01:05:57,920 --> 01:06:00,920
Yeah, so save your performances and play them back for your friends.

820
01:06:00,920 --> 01:06:04,920
Somebody in chat said something about it, that it's actually on the Music in Every Direction site,

821
01:06:04,920 --> 01:06:08,920
but okay, interesting, I totally missed that when I looked at the site there.

822
01:06:08,920 --> 01:06:13,920
But that's cool about the song list, I did not know about M2-Step version 1.1.

823
01:06:13,920 --> 01:06:15,920
It does say there's also internet rankings.

824
01:06:15,920 --> 01:06:21,320
really interesting well we'll see well thank you for the inside scoop mail and

825
01:06:21,320 --> 01:06:24,800
and we'll be looking forward to seeing the song list and videos and other

826
01:06:24,800 --> 01:06:28,320
reactions over on orange large radio.com yeah sure it might even do I might

827
01:06:28,320 --> 01:06:32,000
probably do a more extensive game right up on orange lounge as well awesome did

828
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:35,400
you see a lot of other cool things there did you see any of the live shows like

829
01:06:35,400 --> 01:06:40,800
freeze pop or zonk um see live shows you mean like the as far as the bands or

830
01:06:40,800 --> 01:06:41,800
or any demos.

831
01:06:41,800 --> 01:06:42,800
The bands?

832
01:06:42,800 --> 01:06:43,800
The bands?

833
01:06:43,800 --> 01:06:44,800
Yeah, how were the bands?

834
01:06:44,800 --> 01:06:46,800
Oh, bands, yeah, yeah, I actually got to see Zonta Friday night.

835
01:06:46,800 --> 01:06:47,800
Awesome, how was it?

836
01:06:47,800 --> 01:06:55,800
And, you know, it was pretty cool, I mean, it's like the first time I've seen the bands

837
01:06:55,800 --> 01:06:58,960
since the lead singer actually had her kid a couple months ago.

838
01:06:58,960 --> 01:06:59,960
Oh, wow.

839
01:06:59,960 --> 01:07:03,600
Yeah, and they, I mean, they always put on a great show live, they're one of those acts

840
01:07:03,600 --> 01:07:07,520
that, I mean, they may, I mean, they sound pretty decent, like when you listen to it

841
01:07:07,520 --> 01:07:10,460
like on you know your headphones or both to see them live they actually have

842
01:07:10,460 --> 01:07:16,280
they're great they have great showmanship great great I'm hoping that

843
01:07:16,280 --> 01:07:20,860
maybe we can talk to him at some point because I want to ask him about love

844
01:07:20,860 --> 01:07:24,380
this feeling and tittle-tattle and all that stuff so we'll see in the future

845
01:07:24,380 --> 01:07:29,100
some point hopefully okay yeah I'll work on scoring I'll work on scoring an

846
01:07:29,100 --> 01:07:32,820
interview because you know me and Dave you know we got it like that sounds good

847
01:07:32,820 --> 01:07:36,340
well Mel thank you for calling in and giving us the scoop appreciate it stay

848
01:07:36,340 --> 01:07:38,340
Stay tuned to orangehonestrader.com for more info.

849
01:07:38,340 --> 01:07:39,340
Alright, no prob.

850
01:07:39,340 --> 01:07:43,780
Peace out people and time to go listen and make some dinner on the meanwhile.

851
01:07:43,780 --> 01:07:44,780
Alright.

852
01:07:44,780 --> 01:07:45,780
Take care, buddy.

853
01:07:45,780 --> 01:07:46,780
Alright.

854
01:07:46,780 --> 01:07:47,780
Take it easy.

855
01:07:47,780 --> 01:07:48,780
Bye-bye.

856
01:07:48,780 --> 01:07:49,780
Alright.

857
01:07:49,780 --> 01:07:53,660
A little difficulty there with the connection it sounds like there, but Mel, we can clearly

858
01:07:53,660 --> 01:07:54,660
hear him.

859
01:07:54,660 --> 01:07:57,340
He's having a hard time understanding us, I think, but we can clearly hear him talking

860
01:07:57,340 --> 01:07:58,780
about BeatMania.

861
01:07:58,780 --> 01:08:03,980
Didn't end up actually getting shown at game until today, but it does look like that they

862
01:08:03,980 --> 01:08:09,220
They are going to call 2DX is the other mode in Beatmania.

863
01:08:09,220 --> 01:08:13,540
And then we have M2 Step 1 and all that.

864
01:08:13,540 --> 01:08:16,920
And actually, I don't know if he said 2DX was the other mode, or if he actually said

865
01:08:16,920 --> 01:08:17,920
it was 2DX.

866
01:08:17,920 --> 01:08:22,540
No, it's Beatmania 2DX, and it's also Beatmania.

867
01:08:22,540 --> 01:08:23,540
It's on all their screens.

868
01:08:23,540 --> 01:08:24,540
Damn, I was hoping for the other one.

869
01:08:24,540 --> 01:08:25,540
Is it in the screenshot there?

870
01:08:25,540 --> 01:08:26,540
No, it's in the screenshot.

871
01:08:26,540 --> 01:08:27,540
OK, all right.

872
01:08:27,540 --> 01:08:28,540
I wish, I wish.

873
01:08:28,540 --> 01:08:29,540
That would have been great.

874
01:08:29,540 --> 01:08:32,980
OK, but that's nice, though, that they call it at least 2DX and like a little bit of a

875
01:08:32,980 --> 01:08:39,980
throwback to what's going on the Japanese side. The M-2 Step song is in it, and...

876
01:08:39,980 --> 01:08:43,980
In My Eyes, Hitchhiker... Well, that's from these screencaps we see,

877
01:08:43,980 --> 01:08:47,460
right? Yeah, these are probably the latest build though. These are ones that are on Music

878
01:08:47,460 --> 01:08:57,600
in Every Direction. I Was The One, GMD, M-02 Step, Version 1.01... What a dumb name for

879
01:08:57,600 --> 01:09:01,320
a song

880
01:09:01,320 --> 01:09:04,520
shame what we are getting hammered on the skype line tonight we better have

881
01:09:04,520 --> 01:09:07,640

891
01:09:35,860 --> 01:09:37,860
Wow, I was very

892
01:09:38,620 --> 01:09:41,580
Excuse me. I wasn't major at one time. I know I know um

893
01:09:42,100 --> 01:09:47,340
But no, I I understand that the fanboys would be very pissed if he didn't show up. So we do have to mention some V

894
01:09:49,620 --> 01:09:53,000
Well other than that I had to make some correction

895
01:09:53,000 --> 01:10:03,040
okay um you said that the 2d x13 distorted location test is going on right

896
01:10:03,040 --> 01:10:08,680
now well actually it just finished right but it just finished yesterday oh yeah

897
01:10:08,680 --> 01:10:12,160
I just I remember reading I think you and Chad or somebody had said something

898
01:10:12,160 --> 01:10:16,880
that it had just finished but yeah it was going on so it just finished though

899
01:10:16,880 --> 01:10:24,240

905
01:10:49,200 --> 01:10:54,840
all this BeatMania US news hmm you know I was you know I was a little

906
01:10:54,840 --> 01:11:01,260
disappointed when I found out that it wasn't showed yesterday thanks to Rich

907
01:11:01,260 --> 01:11:08,960
who was there yesterday yeah a little a little technical foul up

908
01:11:08,960 --> 01:11:12,040
there but now we understand what's going on what do you think about the recording

909
01:11:12,040 --> 01:11:19,100
mode I think that's kind of interesting yeah I'll think about that but I wasn't

910
01:11:19,100 --> 01:11:23,620
surprised yeah seems like I guess I think I think it shows the Konami might

911
01:11:23,620 --> 01:11:26,620
be kind of looking on what's going out there on the internet right now like

912
01:11:26,620 --> 01:11:30,100
what are the fans of 2dx seem to really get into what do they want in the game

913
01:11:30,100 --> 01:11:34,220
and maybe they kind of picked up on the whole like you know vj-army tracking

914
01:11:34,220 --> 01:11:37,900
thing and maybe they thought it was something they could build into the game

915
01:11:37,900 --> 01:11:44,620
don't know just a thought I don't know yeah so well Ziggy anything else you

916
01:11:44,620 --> 01:11:51,740
want to share with us well nothing much else at the moment but uh yeah okay well

01:11:51,740 --> 01:11:54,460
thank I appreciate the call as always we're gonna get to some other calls

01:11:54,460 --> 01:11:57,740
because we're getting hammered tonight but have a good one okay buddy yeah all

919
01:11:57,740 --> 01:12:01,860
right later later all right Ziggy reminding us that

920
01:12:01,860 --> 01:12:06,340
Gita Dora v2 stuff is ready to go he sent us some songs from there so we're

921
01:12:06,340 --> 01:12:09,720
to check that out during the next break because I'm excited to hear some of the stuff so we're

922
01:12:09,720 --> 01:12:14,400
going to do that. Let's go to another call, lots and lots to pick from. Oh my gosh, I'm

923
01:12:14,400 --> 01:12:18,080
just going to pick the one that was on the line first. Hi, you're on Orange Laundry

924
01:12:18,080 --> 01:12:28,920
Radio. Hello. Hello. Hi, who is this? It's Nintendo Maniac 64. Hello Nintendo Maniac

925
01:12:28,920 --> 01:12:37,680
64 what's on your mind buddy playing Mario Kart as we speak awesome still

926
01:12:37,680 --> 01:12:43,120
playing are you are you able to find friends on there because every time I go

927
01:12:43,120 --> 01:12:46,880
in to do a friends matchup my friends are never online I don't even bother

928
01:12:46,880 --> 01:12:56,080
anymore I pretty much do rivals mode what right I haven't done rivals but I

929
01:12:56,080 --> 01:12:59,600
I hear that Rivals is a good way to find people at your own skill level, so I need to do that

930
01:12:59,600 --> 01:13:03,400
one more often, because otherwise I get my ass kicked almost every time.

931
01:13:03,400 --> 01:13:08,000
So I need to get matched up against some seven-year-olds, so I can have a sense of accomplishment when

932
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:09,560
I actually, like, beat it.

933
01:13:09,560 --> 01:13:15,080
But you know, I actually played Mario Kart DS this last week, I played with several other

934
01:13:15,080 --> 01:13:21,520
people that have DS's, and we actually played the mode where you can broadcast the game,

935
01:13:21,520 --> 01:13:22,520
you can download the game.

936
01:13:22,520 --> 01:13:25,280
What I thought was kind of cool, and I haven't really seen this in a lot of DS games, is

937
01:13:25,280 --> 01:13:30,120
that you can mix and match, people that have the game and people that don't have the game,

938
01:13:30,120 --> 01:13:33,960
you can play multiplayer mode with people that do and don't have the game. And basically

939
01:13:33,960 --> 01:13:38,120
anybody that doesn't have the game will be a Shy Guy, which isn't even a character that

940
01:13:38,120 --> 01:13:40,740
you can unlock in the normal game. So I thought that was kind of weird because I hear the

941
01:13:40,740 --> 01:13:46,400
Shy Guy actually has like just a perfectly balanced average car. So my friends are actually

942
01:13:46,400 --> 01:13:49,540
doing very well with the Shy Guy cars, but everybody else who has the game will get to

943
01:13:49,540 --> 01:13:56,160
pick from any character, and unfortunately when you're playing with anybody that doesn't

944
01:13:56,160 --> 01:14:00,560
have the game, you can only pick from one battle track, and I think eight of the typical

945
01:14:00,560 --> 01:14:06,520
race courses. You can do anything in the first Retro Cup and in the first Mario DS Cup. So,

946
01:14:06,520 --> 01:14:10,760
it was interesting though, it's a good time. Yeah, Baby the Tiger is supposed to get like

947
01:14:10,760 --> 01:14:15,480
a bit of a handicap for those people who don't have it, so they don't have as much practice.

948
01:14:15,480 --> 01:14:17,160
I don't know.

949
01:14:17,160 --> 01:14:20,440
Oh, that might be a good point is that they do the balance car

950
01:14:20,440 --> 01:14:23,640
because those people don't have practice like the rest of us addicts do.

951
01:14:23,640 --> 01:14:29,040
That's a good thought. Are you going to be online with Animal Crossing this week?

952
01:14:29,040 --> 01:14:30,880
Uh...

953
01:14:30,880 --> 01:14:34,680
I might pick up the game but maybe not this week.

954
01:14:34,680 --> 01:14:36,280
I'm still kind of thinking about it

955
01:14:36,280 --> 01:14:39,160
because I didn't really...

956
01:14:39,160 --> 01:14:42,640
I'm not too much of an Animal Crossing fan but the online sounds really cool.

957
01:14:42,640 --> 01:14:50,640
I'm excited about this. We'll see. I can understand, though. Animal Crossing is a very quirky sort of game, so I can see where

958
01:14:50,640 --> 01:14:54,640
it might not be like you're jumping at the chance trying to get it, so okay.

959
01:14:54,640 --> 01:15:00,640
Yeah. But the online... Yeah, I'm very curious to see how the online stuff is going to work, too, because we don't really know.

960
01:15:00,640 --> 01:15:08,640
I mean, we hear how things are supposed to work, but we haven't really seen it in motion a whole lot except E3, which wasn't exactly

961
01:15:08,640 --> 01:15:11,800
a tell-all type situation so we'll see

962
01:15:11,800 --> 01:15:15,360
we'll see anything else you want to share with our listeners

963
01:15:15,360 --> 01:15:19,060
yeah my L button on my DS is crapped out

964
01:15:19,060 --> 01:15:23,320
that sucks can you do a warranty thing did you email Nintendo

965
01:15:23,320 --> 01:15:26,760
unfortunately my DS just came out of warranty

966
01:15:26,760 --> 01:15:30,060
ouch that is so typical

967
01:15:30,060 --> 01:15:33,520
but what?

968
01:15:33,520 --> 01:15:39,360
we got it on a credit card that will actually allow us to extend the warranty

969
01:15:39,360 --> 01:15:43,120
for just like I don't know how long but apparently they can cover it

970
01:15:43,120 --> 01:15:47,320
which is like really cool that's pretty awesome I'd never would have thought of

971
01:15:47,320 --> 01:15:49,200
that and that's actually probably a good tip

972
01:15:49,200 --> 01:15:52,800
especially this time of year for people that are listening

973
01:15:52,800 --> 01:15:56,400
if your shit breaks especially like god damn my microphone

974
01:15:56,400 --> 01:16:00,920
on if your stuff breaks ups a few if your stuff breaks

975
01:16:00,920 --> 01:16:04,360
Don't just check with the manufacturer, check with your credit card company because there

976
01:16:04,360 --> 01:16:13,360
may be some type of extension warranty or something else that might be available to

977
01:16:13,360 --> 01:16:14,360
you.

978
01:16:14,360 --> 01:16:18,520
Sorry to break your ears there.

979
01:16:18,520 --> 01:16:21,400
I swear to God, this mic is so fire.

980
01:16:21,400 --> 01:16:27,080
There might be something else available to you on your credit card warranty that goes

981
01:16:27,080 --> 01:16:29,000
beyond the manufacturer.

982
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:30,640
There, finally.

983
01:16:30,640 --> 01:16:37,080
check out good tip thank you for reminding us okay all right yeah I

984
01:16:37,080 --> 01:16:41,760
pretty much just use the X button for items now that but see that's that's

985
01:16:41,760 --> 01:16:46,800
tough with the finger and everything I can't do that I need my L button I love

986
01:16:46,800 --> 01:16:51,720
my L button I yeah I mean at first I didn't think I'd be able to do it but

987
01:16:51,720 --> 01:16:57,460
all I do is I just move my my thumb is still holding it down a I'm just like my

988
01:16:57,460 --> 01:17:01,460
My nail actually hits the X button, not my actual finger.

989
01:17:01,460 --> 01:17:04,460
So if I cut my nails, I probably wouldn't be able to hit X.

990
01:17:04,460 --> 01:17:07,460
Well, a good incentive not to be biting those nails.

991
01:17:07,460 --> 01:17:08,460
Don't bite them nails.

992
01:17:08,460 --> 01:17:12,460
Yeah, except I just bit one of them.

993
01:17:12,460 --> 01:17:13,460
All right.

994
01:17:13,460 --> 01:17:14,460
All right.

995
01:17:14,460 --> 01:17:17,460
Oh, I got other stuff.

996
01:17:17,460 --> 01:17:18,460
Okay.

997
01:17:18,460 --> 01:17:24,460
Last night, I went on a huge StepMania song downloading spree.

998
01:17:24,460 --> 01:17:25,460
And what'd you find?

999
01:17:25,460 --> 01:17:26,460
Anything good?

1000
01:17:26,460 --> 01:17:38,820
Um, yeah, um, I did find some, like, official DDR songs and stuff, like Butterfly, uh, Mr. Wonderful, things like those.

1001
01:17:38,820 --> 01:17:41,580
That shit's old! That shit is so old!

1002
01:17:41,580 --> 01:17:47,780
You know, I don't have any kind of Playstation and stuff, so I've never even played the songs, okay?

1003
01:17:47,780 --> 01:17:53,860
Well, that's, that's where the simulator stuff can be kind of fun, is that you can download the old shit you might have missed out on, alright.

1004
01:17:53,860 --> 01:17:59,860
Yeah, and I actually completely recreated Sandstorm on every difficulty.

1005
01:17:59,860 --> 01:18:00,860
Wow.

1006
01:18:00,860 --> 01:18:01,860
Yeah.

1007
01:18:01,860 --> 01:18:06,860
That's a lot of Raven.

1008
01:18:06,860 --> 01:18:13,860
Alright, well, Nintendo Maniac, we gotta let you go because we're gonna try and get at

1009
01:18:13,860 --> 01:18:17,340
least one more call before we go to break, but thank you for calling in, and good luck

1010
01:18:17,340 --> 01:18:18,340
with that L button.

1011
01:18:18,340 --> 01:18:19,340
Thanks.

1012
01:18:19,340 --> 01:18:20,340
Alright.

1013
01:18:20,340 --> 01:18:21,340
Take care.

1014
01:18:21,340 --> 01:18:22,340
By the way, I'm winning.

1015
01:18:22,340 --> 01:18:23,340
By the way, what?

1016
01:18:23,340 --> 01:18:24,340
I'm winning.

1017
01:18:24,340 --> 01:18:25,340
Good.

1018
01:18:25,340 --> 01:18:26,340
Well, kick some ass.

1019
01:18:26,340 --> 01:18:27,340
Kick some ass.

1020
01:18:27,340 --> 01:18:28,340
Kick some ass.

1021
01:18:28,340 --> 01:18:29,340
Kick some ass.

1022
01:18:29,340 --> 01:18:30,340
Have fun, buddy.

1023
01:18:30,340 --> 01:18:31,340
Yeah.

1024
01:18:31,340 --> 01:18:32,340
Later.

1025
01:18:32,340 --> 01:18:36,340
One more call, call, call, call.

1026
01:18:36,340 --> 01:18:37,340
Let's see.

1027
01:18:37,340 --> 01:18:38,340
How about this one?

1028
01:18:38,340 --> 01:18:39,340
Hi, everyone.

1029
01:18:39,340 --> 01:18:41,340
It's on the radio.

1030
01:18:41,340 --> 01:18:44,340
Hey, this is SSJ100 Matt here.

1031
01:18:44,340 --> 01:18:46,340
Hello, SSJ100 Matt here.

1032
01:18:46,340 --> 01:18:48,340
What's on your mind?

1033
01:18:48,340 --> 01:18:52,340
Actually, I got some minor news for myself.

1034
01:18:52,340 --> 01:19:00,340
I got special advanced press screenings to the movie Grandma's Boy.

1035
01:19:00,340 --> 01:19:06,340
Grandma's Boy? Oh, this is the Adam Sandler movie where he plays like a game tester or something, huh?

1036
01:19:06,340 --> 01:19:09,340
Did you actually see the movie?

1037
01:19:09,340 --> 01:19:14,340
Well, no, the advanced screening is for this Thursday.

1038
01:19:14,340 --> 01:19:18,340
Is that Adam Sandler? What's his name? I don't remember the guy's name.

1039
01:19:18,340 --> 01:19:19,340
Rob Schneider?

1040
01:19:19,340 --> 01:19:20,340
That's not Rob Schneider.

1041
01:19:20,340 --> 01:19:21,340
I thought it was Adam Sandler.

1042
01:19:21,340 --> 01:19:22,340
I know him.

1043
01:19:22,340 --> 01:19:24,340
No, it's Happy Madison.

1044
01:19:24,340 --> 01:19:25,340
Alan something.

1045
01:19:25,340 --> 01:19:30,340
Happy Madison is the one doing the production on it.

1046
01:19:30,340 --> 01:19:33,340
I don't remember who's the maker.

1047
01:19:33,340 --> 01:19:34,340
Well, some person.

1048
01:19:34,340 --> 01:19:38,340
So how did you manage to get this ticket?

1049
01:19:38,340 --> 01:19:48,340
Well, the television studio that I worked at was giving out, like, okay, we have 12 tickets, who wants them?

1050
01:19:48,340 --> 01:19:50,340
And I just jumped on top of two, so...

1051
01:19:50,340 --> 01:19:54,340
Well, that was easy. Those fell in your lap, didn't they? That must be nice.

1052
01:19:54,340 --> 01:20:01,340
Yeah. So, the premiere is Thursday, and they're going to make a big deal out of it,

1053
01:20:01,340 --> 01:20:03,220
deal out of and they're going to have uh...

1054
01:20:03,220 --> 01:20:05,380
e sports uh...

1055
01:20:05,380 --> 01:20:06,500
going to be uh...

1056
01:20:06,500 --> 01:20:10,580
uh... showing off games uh... before the screening

1057
01:20:10,580 --> 01:20:13,300
very cool i'm looking at some of these people who are in the movie i don't

1058
01:20:13,300 --> 01:20:15,420
recognize any of these people at all

1059
01:20:15,420 --> 01:20:18,940
hope there's robschneider isn't it and david spade and have a new and all this

1060
01:20:18,940 --> 01:20:22,340
is like an early nineties saturday night live thing going on here

1061
01:20:22,340 --> 01:20:25,540
yet on the old woman from uh...

1062
01:20:25,540 --> 01:20:28,780
doris roberts one of the most roman yam

1063
01:20:28,780 --> 01:20:32,660
OK, I'm trying to look at the poster here.

1064
01:20:32,660 --> 01:20:34,060
I love Internet Movie Database.

1065
01:20:34,060 --> 01:20:35,820
Answers all my movie questions.

1066
01:20:35,820 --> 01:20:37,180
And they didn't pay me to say that even.

1067
01:20:37,180 --> 01:20:40,460
I really do love this one.

1068
01:20:40,460 --> 01:20:41,660
Linda Cardellini.

1069
01:20:41,660 --> 01:20:44,380
Oh, they've got a lot of people in this movie.

1070
01:20:44,380 --> 01:20:48,780
OK, well, that should be interesting.

1071
01:20:48,780 --> 01:20:54,100
And supposedly Kevin Nealon's supposed to show up, so

1072
01:20:54,100 --> 01:20:57,580
hopefully I can give him my business card or something so

1073
01:20:57,580 --> 01:21:02,520
they can hire me for a movie or something. It's the Hollywood way, it'll be awesome.

1074
01:21:02,520 --> 01:21:06,720
What was I going to say about this movie? You'll call back and let us know if it's good

1075
01:21:06,720 --> 01:21:14,040
or not, right? Next week? Yeah, next week. Sounds good. Anything else you want to share

1076
01:21:14,040 --> 01:21:17,500
with our listeners, besides rubbing it in that you get to go to a movie premiere and

1077
01:21:17,500 --> 01:21:25,880
we don't? Well, the movie comes out January 6th, so...

1078
01:21:25,880 --> 01:21:31,600
That's not a good sign, because January is when the studios unload their crap.

1079
01:21:31,600 --> 01:21:33,600
Didn't Resident Evil 2 come out in January?

1080
01:21:33,600 --> 01:21:37,440
No, but a wonderful movie called BloodRayne is coming out in January.

1081
01:21:37,440 --> 01:21:40,440
Like I said, that's when the studios unload all their crap.

1082
01:21:40,440 --> 01:21:42,760
No, I don't know, it might be fun.

1083
01:21:42,760 --> 01:21:47,600
Just let us know if it makes gamers look like dumbasses or not, because I'm very interested

1084
01:21:47,600 --> 01:21:53,600
to see what happens with another gaming movie and all that stuff, so.

1085
01:21:53,600 --> 01:21:55,600
All right, but uh

1086
01:21:56,320 --> 01:22:01,760
Yeah, but yeah, that's it. Okay. Well, thanks for calling in have fun at the movie. Let us know how it goes. All righty

1087
01:22:02,960 --> 01:22:05,280
All right. All right. Later. All right. Bye

1088
01:22:05,840 --> 01:22:07,360
Yep, bye

1089
01:22:07,360 --> 01:22:09,000
Okay

1090
01:22:09,000 --> 01:22:13,460
Call there from SSJ 100 Matt who by the way is looking for a job in the industry

1091
01:22:13,460 --> 01:22:15,460
So if you know a rich producer

1092
01:22:17,560 --> 01:22:19,560
He wants a job so give him a job

1093
01:22:19,560 --> 01:22:28,560
We want a job too, actually. We could use a job. I would sell My Immortal Soul to do Orange Lounge on TV or something. That would be fun.

1094
01:22:28,560 --> 01:22:31,560
I don't know how to do it on TV. I like the radio.

1095
01:22:31,560 --> 01:22:36,560
The radio is fun, but the whole world needs to see my sexy butt is what it really boils down to.

1096
01:22:39,560 --> 01:22:45,560
Alright, anyway, just teasing kids. We're going to go to a break because we need a break. I need to get up and stretch and air out a little bit.

1097
01:22:45,560 --> 01:22:50,400
air out a little bit. So we're going to play some songs, as promised, from Gita Doda V

1098
01:22:50,400 --> 01:22:57,000
2. So we're going to hear Vanilla Ninja with Metal Queen, because that song sounds awesome.

1099
01:22:57,000 --> 01:23:02,440
We're going to hear a song by a group called Twinkle Berry, because it's called Twinkle

1100
01:23:02,440 --> 01:23:06,320
Berry. How can it be bad? It sounds too much like Dingle Berry. And then I'm curious, we're

1101
01:23:06,320 --> 01:23:10,440
going to hear a Tara song, and I'm really curious if model DD7 has anything to do with

1102
01:23:10,440 --> 01:23:14,200
the other model song that's been in it. Yes, it does. Good, then we'll hear it. There's

1103
01:23:14,200 --> 01:23:18,560
been like tons of them. Alright, well we'll see. So we'll be back after this with more

1104
01:23:18,560 --> 01:23:25,560
Orange launch radio and maybe some more skype if you kids are good.

1105
01:23:48,560 --> 01:23:50,560
I'm finding my friend a poison

1106
01:23:50,560 --> 01:23:53,560
To lose all the blood that I...

1107
01:23:53,560 --> 01:23:55,560
Oh...

1108
01:23:55,560 --> 01:23:57,560
Thank you in the light

1109
01:23:59,560 --> 01:24:01,560
Master Queen

1110
01:24:01,560 --> 01:24:04,560
She's gonna break us

1111
01:24:04,560 --> 01:24:06,560
Oh...

1112
01:24:06,560 --> 01:24:09,560
You're a mystic alive

1113
01:24:10,560 --> 01:24:12,560
Master Queen

1114
01:24:12,560 --> 01:24:15,560
I'll be the star

1115
01:24:15,560 --> 01:24:20,560
When I'm all up for the love of mine

1116
01:24:20,560 --> 01:24:22,560
Yeah

1117
01:24:22,560 --> 01:24:45,560
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

1118
01:24:45,560 --> 01:24:50,560
You're a queen, you're a queen of love

1119
01:24:50,560 --> 01:24:56,560
Oh, you're a victory for life

1120
01:24:56,560 --> 01:25:01,560
That's my queen, I'm in the sky

1121
01:25:01,560 --> 01:25:05,560
We're all alone for the love of night

1122
01:25:35,560 --> 01:25:42,560
Naka te mo taruto nante Masani hato ito meduyo ne

1123
01:25:42,560 --> 01:25:49,560
Tato, tato, mai nuki tato, tato, tote mo ouiji tato

1124
01:25:49,560 --> 01:25:55,560
Tato, mai ban tato, tato, yame la rena ino tato

1125
01:25:55,560 --> 01:26:01,560
Matashi no tsukilamo no Shono iwa kare dake so

1126
01:26:01,560 --> 01:26:04,560
Taru to ni kuramte leba

1127
01:26:04,560 --> 01:26:07,560
Miro sugina no yoko de me

1128

01:26:10,560 --> 01:26:12,560
Macho hono daruto, daruto

1130
01:26:12,560 --> 01:26:15,560

Taru to abaguite sudai daruto

Hanamo hachi nalu hoko

Beni mukate

1135
01:26:27,560 --> 01:26:34,080
Sae kim kun tota, dan te kare ga yu hu

1136
01:26:34,080 --> 01:26:40,080
Deli kashi no naiko no shi toko sode

1137
01:26:40,080 --> 01:26:46,080
Kiru sui ita no mota be nai no mota be ho

1138
01:26:46,080 --> 01:26:49,080
Watashi wa amato o yo

1139
01:26:49,080 --> 01:26:53,880
Yuto yo hi amato o ne te mo odome wa

1140
01:26:53,880 --> 01:26:59,560
We are all the same, all except for our own

1141
01:29:53,880 --> 01:29:55,880
Oh

1142
01:30:23,880 --> 01:30:51,080
The

1143
01:30:51,080 --> 01:30:53,820
Even if we stay hard

1144
01:30:53,820 --> 01:30:57,820
But do they ever tell me?

1145
01:31:23,820 --> 01:31:25,820
It's

1146
01:32:25,820 --> 01:32:55,260
For the next slide to Orange Lab, this GDR sucks!

1147
01:32:55,260 --> 01:33:02,260
all

1148
01:33:03,960 --> 01:33:07,340
We're back to Orange Lounge Radio and in that break we heard a

1149
01:33:07,340 --> 01:33:10,560
Whole Cluster Fucka music from Gitadora V2

1150
01:33:10,560 --> 01:33:14,280
and I understand that people are leaving

1151
01:33:14,280 --> 01:33:18,220
listening to our show to go watch other things on television like the Boondocks

1152
01:33:18,220 --> 01:33:22,460
or a Family Guy. TV addicts you need to get all of your butts.

1153
01:33:22,460 --> 01:33:25,460
You bitches need to get a TiVo or a BitTorrent.

1154
01:33:25,460 --> 01:33:26,460
Screw TiVo!

1155
01:33:26,460 --> 01:33:28,460
BitTorrent, yeah, BitTorrent is the way to go.

1156
01:33:28,460 --> 01:33:30,460
It's on before the show is even on.

1157
01:33:30,460 --> 01:33:32,460
It's on demand, is what it is.

1158
01:33:32,460 --> 01:33:37,460
You can literally, if you have news groups, I do this almost every week.

1159
01:33:37,460 --> 01:33:41,460
When I get done with the show, I go watch my episode of Family Guy.

1160
01:33:41,460 --> 01:33:42,460
There you go.

1161
01:33:42,460 --> 01:33:43,460
After the show!

1162
01:33:43,460 --> 01:33:45,460
That's how you do it.

1163
01:33:45,460 --> 01:33:47,460
So I'm just poking fun at people that dare ditch us.

1164
01:33:47,460 --> 01:33:49,460
TiVo is evil.

1165
01:33:49,460 --> 01:33:51,460
Because the government has access to it.

1166
01:33:51,460 --> 01:33:54,460
Oh no, the government knows I watch Will and Grace.

1167
01:33:54,460 --> 01:33:57,460
What am I going to do?

1168
01:33:57,460 --> 01:33:58,460
Tevo knows you're gay now.

1169
01:33:58,460 --> 01:34:00,460
The government might think I'm gay.

1170
01:34:00,460 --> 01:34:03,460
Although Will and Grace is, you know, it's so...

1171
01:34:03,460 --> 01:34:04,460
I don't know how to call it.

1172
01:34:04,460 --> 01:34:05,460
It's not really whitewashed.

1173
01:34:05,460 --> 01:34:08,460
It's black and whitewashed instead of rainbow.

1174
01:34:08,460 --> 01:34:11,460
It's black and whitewashed is what Will and Grace is.

1175
01:34:11,460 --> 01:34:16,460
It's grayscaled, basically.

1176
01:34:16,460 --> 01:34:21,980
Anyway, um, do-do-do-do-do-do-do, where were we going?

1177
01:34:21,980 --> 01:34:26,780
Uh, I'm driving this car, turning it around.

1178
01:34:26,780 --> 01:34:30,300
Oh yeah, uh, I was going to get to the cage match

1179
01:34:30,300 --> 01:34:33,660
pretty soon here, because I know we want to do a cage match. You have a song, right?

1180
01:34:33,660 --> 01:34:34,180
Because...

1181
01:34:34,180 --> 01:34:38,860
Well, of course I have a song, because I didn't win last week. I know, just making sure, because I hadn't seen it yet.

1182
01:34:38,860 --> 01:34:42,220
Just making sure you had a song somewhere. Alright, um,

1183
01:34:42,220 --> 01:34:47,780
I want to mention this really quick though, which I think, oh, two things I want to mention

1184
01:34:47,780 --> 01:34:50,940
real quick. Somebody brought it up in the chat room during break and I was talking about

1185
01:34:50,940 --> 01:34:57,300
Energies at the top of the show, or Energies, Energies drinks at the top of the show and

1186
01:34:57,300 --> 01:35:00,980
somebody in chat reminded us about the Final Fantasy Energies drink that's coming out called

1187
01:35:00,980 --> 01:35:05,580
Potion. Have you heard of this? I swear to God I'm not making this shit up. There's this

1188
01:35:05,580 --> 01:35:09,060
new Energies drink out, coming out called, wait, somebody give me a web link. I read

1189
01:35:09,060 --> 01:35:13,700
about this on the entire potion in tarnet high potion will be the one

1190
01:35:13,700 --> 01:35:20,380
that's like I don't know diet or something we'll see I want an ether I

1191
01:35:20,380 --> 01:35:29,540
want Phoenix down let's see there it is Final Fantasy 12 potion and this is what

1192
01:35:29,540 --> 01:35:33,940
it is it's a it's a food tie in there and we're looking at it there is this on

1193
01:35:33,940 --> 01:35:40,020
on Gamebrink.com is what it is here. It's some type of tie-in to Final Fantasy 12 here.

1194
01:35:40,020 --> 01:35:44,700
I wish I could zoom in on the product. It looks an awful lot like balls or Powerade,

1195
01:35:44,700 --> 01:35:47,720
but actually I like the play on it because it looks like it's actually like in a potion

1196
01:35:47,720 --> 01:35:52,460
or something. March 2006 is when this stuff goes on sale.

1197
01:35:52,460 --> 01:35:58,500
The drink supposedly makes you relax like herb tea and tastes mystical. It contains

1198
01:35:58,500 --> 01:36:03,680
nutritional supplements so that the company can claim the drinker might recover real-life

1199
01:36:03,680 --> 01:36:19,440
hit points. And if you drink this, you're a nerd. A really big nerd. Just kidding. What

1200
01:36:19,440 --> 01:36:27,800
can you do? Will I go up a level? Will I do the little dance? Will I throw my arms up?

1201
01:36:27,800 --> 01:36:31,260
Have you played the Final Fantasy 12 demo? I like the bottles. Wait, have you played

1202
01:36:31,260 --> 01:36:36,420
the Final Fantasy XII demo? No, and I'm not going to, because I played it... It's sexy.

1203
01:36:36,420 --> 01:36:40,160
It's different than the E3 one. It's way different. Not from what everybody in the universe else

1204
01:36:40,160 --> 01:36:45,680
has told me? Nope. They're lying. All of them. Okay. Alright. I like these bottles. They're

1205
01:36:45,680 --> 01:36:50,240
cool. I'll get it just for the bottles. What else did I want to mention? Oh, yes. Final

1206
01:36:50,240 --> 01:36:56,120
Fantasy. On the cell phones, you guys pretty soon are going to be able to play DDR. Why

1207
01:36:56,120 --> 01:37:00,440
you would want to play DDR on your cell phone is beyond me, but they are, they were showing

1208
01:37:00,440 --> 01:37:04,440
this supposedly at the Game Festival, and I completely forgot to ask Mel about this

1209
01:37:04,440 --> 01:37:08,080
because he was there, but he probably wasn't even looking for it because, my God, who gives

1210
01:37:08,080 --> 01:37:14,320
a shit about mobile gaming? I know I don't. But we actually ran a story about this on

1211
01:37:14,320 --> 01:37:19,120
orangelunchmedia.com. This part of it is kind of old news that you can buy the mobile ringtones

1212
01:37:19,120 --> 01:37:25,520
that feature DDR songs, but what may be kind of news to you is that they did show in the

1213
01:37:25,520 --> 01:37:27,840
games on the go area of the game festival

1214
01:37:27,840 --> 01:37:30,440
that there will be doing DDR on mobile phones

1215
01:37:30,440 --> 01:37:33,760
this is probably just a port of what we've seen happen in japan because i

1216
01:37:33,760 --> 01:37:35,520
believe they already have this in japan

1217
01:37:35,520 --> 01:37:38,880
uh... yeah a couple and they have like max three hundred

1218
01:37:38,880 --> 01:37:40,200
i've seen

1219
01:37:40,200 --> 01:37:43,320
oh you got a bigger picture

1220
01:37:43,320 --> 01:37:45,040
that looks interesting

1221
01:37:45,040 --> 01:37:47,960
okay sorry jamie was showing me the potions

1222
01:37:47,960 --> 01:37:51,360
so yeah what can i say it's DDR on the cell phone but funny enough the screenshot

1223
01:37:51,360 --> 01:37:53,640
i saw was max three hundred

1224
01:37:53,640 --> 01:37:57,380
And why you would want to play that on a cell phone, I have no idea, especially if there's

1225
01:37:57,380 --> 01:37:58,380
no dance pad hookup.

1226
01:37:58,380 --> 01:38:00,740
That's like an exercise in futility.

1227
01:38:00,740 --> 01:38:03,700
Even if there was a dance pad hookup, that would be stupid.

1228
01:38:03,700 --> 01:38:10,700
The only use I would see for this is if you are a freestyler who needs your steps on the

1229
01:38:10,700 --> 01:38:12,700
go.

1230
01:38:12,700 --> 01:38:16,180
Like if you're going to be in an upcoming tournament or something, you need to take

1231
01:38:16,180 --> 01:38:19,660
a quick look at those steps before you go up on stage, like one more time, run through

1232
01:38:19,660 --> 01:38:23,260
the routine in your mind, that's where DDR on the cell phone would be a good idea.

1233
01:38:23,260 --> 01:38:27,260
the rest of this crap

1234
01:38:27,260 --> 01:38:28,740
but whatever

1235
01:38:28,740 --> 01:38:31,100
I'll probably buy it anyway because I'm a consumer horror

1236
01:38:31,100 --> 01:38:34,280
honestly

1237
01:38:34,280 --> 01:38:37,040
Jamie's showing me the bigger pictures of potion

1238
01:38:37,040 --> 01:38:39,020
that looks very nice

1239
01:38:39,020 --> 01:38:40,780
looks pretty, pretty bottles

1240
01:38:40,780 --> 01:38:44,260
I would rather buy a lot of Final Fantasy potion than DDR on the cell phone

1241
01:38:44,260 --> 01:38:49,380
that's for sure

1242
01:38:49,380 --> 01:38:51,540
anywho

1243
01:38:51,540 --> 01:38:53,660
Let's do tonight's cage match, shall we?

1244
01:38:53,660 --> 01:38:57,540
It's where we put three songs in battle against each other to the death

1245
01:38:57,540 --> 01:39:00,020
and there are fatalities involved

1246
01:39:00,020 --> 01:39:02,660
and one song emerges as the victor.

1247
01:39:02,660 --> 01:39:06,020
And you guys in chat have the final say on which one of these songs is the winner.

1248
01:39:06,020 --> 01:39:09,220
The winning song, by the way, goes into rotation all week long.

1249
01:39:09,220 --> 01:39:11,420
All freaking week long on Orange Lawn Radio's

1250
01:39:11,420 --> 01:39:14,600
Bomani and Video Game Music program, which is awesome.

1251
01:39:14,600 --> 01:39:16,940
So let's get it started, shall we?

1252
01:39:16,940 --> 01:39:20,020
Sure.

1253
01:39:20,020 --> 01:39:26,980
Last week in the Orange Songs Radio Cage Match, an old friend band of Jamie's made it, a friendly

1254
01:39:26,980 --> 01:39:28,580
old band, a jolly old time.

1255
01:39:28,580 --> 01:39:32,900
Blur was the band, and the song was called Crazy Beat.

1256
01:39:32,900 --> 01:39:36,460
Is it crazy enough to win for a second week in a row?

1257
01:39:36,460 --> 01:39:39,220
I don't know, we'll see.

1258
01:39:39,220 --> 01:39:43,180
So we're going to play a clip for you guys so you can judge if you like this or not and

1259
01:39:43,180 --> 01:39:44,780
want it to win for the second week in a row.

1260
01:39:44,780 --> 01:39:48,620
So here it is, song one, it's a nice Cage Match Blur with Crazy Beat.

1261
01:39:48,620 --> 01:39:49,620
Enjoy.

1262
01:39:49,620 --> 01:40:04,620
I like my brothers on Saturday night, yeah

1263
01:40:04,620 --> 01:40:05,620
Yeah!

1264
01:40:18,920 --> 01:40:19,920
Breakdown!

1265
01:40:25,420 --> 01:40:29,420
I'm on my own about to turn a little crazy again

1266
01:40:29,920 --> 01:40:32,920
I'm dying here for a money I spent

1267
01:40:32,920 --> 01:40:54,240
I love my sister and I love her tonight

1268
01:40:54,240 --> 01:41:07,980
That's withstandation and it can't be President

1269
01:41:08,020 --> 01:41:15,400
Break-up in me

1270
01:41:45,400 --> 01:42:01,680
Song numero uno in tonight's cage match, blur with crazy beats.

1271
01:42:01,680 --> 01:42:04,340
You only get a clip of that though because if you wanted to hear the whole thing you

1272
01:42:04,340 --> 01:42:06,920
should have been listening last week, honestly, kids.

1273
01:42:06,920 --> 01:42:10,720
Alright, song number two in tonight's cage match comes to us via the Loki.

1274
01:42:10,720 --> 01:42:13,720
Loki, what did you pick for us tonight, sir?

1275
01:42:15,720 --> 01:42:19,720
I picked something from Alien 3.16, which is interesting.

1276
01:42:19,720 --> 01:42:24,720
See, they should have been Alien 3.14, because then they should have been Alien Pie.

1277
01:42:26,720 --> 01:42:27,720
I'm lame. Shut up.

1278
01:42:27,720 --> 01:42:38,720
Anyways, yeah, so this is a song from Alien 3.16, which you might remember from UltraMix 1 with C Square, or wait, UltraMix 2. I take that back.

1279
01:42:38,720 --> 01:42:40,720
By the way, it's Alien 613.

1280
01:42:40,720 --> 01:42:44,720
613, whatever, 313, whatever, who gives a crap?

1281
01:42:44,720 --> 01:42:45,720
Alien and some number...

1282
01:42:45,720 --> 01:42:48,720
Anyways, this is the song All For Nothing.

1283
01:42:48,720 --> 01:42:50,720
Alright.

1284
01:42:50,720 --> 01:42:57,720
Alien number 613 was all for nothing. Enjoy song number two.

1285
01:43:20,720 --> 01:43:27,720
Money

1286
01:43:27,720 --> 01:43:32,720
Cars

1287
01:43:32,720 --> 01:43:36,720
Breathing

1288
01:43:36,720 --> 01:43:39,720
Cellular phones

1289
01:44:09,720 --> 01:44:11,720
My

1290
01:44:11,720 --> 01:44:13,720
You

1291
01:44:13,720 --> 01:44:15,720
My

1292
01:44:15,720 --> 01:44:17,720
You

1293
01:44:17,720 --> 01:44:19,720
My

1294
01:44:19,720 --> 01:44:21,720
You

1295
01:44:21,720 --> 01:44:23,720
My

1296
01:44:23,720 --> 01:44:25,720
Love

1297
01:44:25,720 --> 01:44:27,720
My

1298
01:44:27,720 --> 01:44:29,720
Breathe

1299
01:44:29,720 --> 01:44:31,720
My

1300
01:44:31,720 --> 01:44:33,720
My

1301
01:44:33,720 --> 01:44:35,720
You

1302
01:44:35,720 --> 01:44:37,720
My

1303
01:45:07,720 --> 01:45:09,720
Fucking hell with you

1304
01:45:39,720 --> 01:46:08,720
Yeah, I do what it be Yeah, I do what it be

1305
01:46:08,720 --> 01:46:36,500
You and I, you and I, you and I, you and I.

1306
01:46:38,720 --> 01:46:50,920
The song numero dos in tonight's cage match, Alien number 613 with All For Nothing, not

1307
01:46:50,920 --> 01:46:55,040
to be confused with the Cher song All or Nothing, two very, very different songs I would just

1308
01:46:55,040 --> 01:46:56,040
like to point out.

1309
01:46:56,040 --> 01:47:02,960
Dark Sakura, was that a number 10 or a number 2?

1310
01:47:02,960 --> 01:47:04,640
It was more like a number 5.

1311
01:47:04,640 --> 01:47:05,640
Okay.

1312
01:47:05,640 --> 01:47:24,640
loki What did you think of all or nothing?

1313
01:47:35,640 --> 01:47:41,640
Six? I don't know, whatever. I really had nothing this week that I hadn't already picked.

1314
01:47:41,640 --> 01:47:45,640
You know, I thought that song was pretty good for me to poop on.

1315
01:47:45,640 --> 01:47:47,640
No, I give it a four.

1316
01:47:47,640 --> 01:47:53,640
Alright, let's move on to song number three. Song number three tonight is my pick.

1317
01:47:53,640 --> 01:47:58,640
And I also picked a former Romani artist because I like this song. It's pretty.

1318
01:47:58,640 --> 01:48:02,640
It's actually a song that she actually released in the U.S.

1319
01:48:02,640 --> 01:48:08,320
It's Tess, and the song is called The Second You Sleep, I Stay To Watch You Fade Away.

1320
01:48:08,320 --> 01:48:12,720
And, um, Tess of course did Justify My Love and all that stuff for DDR.

1321
01:48:12,720 --> 01:48:16,160
So here it is, Tess, here on Orange Lounge Radio, song number three.

1322
01:48:17,440 --> 01:48:26,480
You close your eyes, and leave me naked by your side.

1323
01:48:26,480 --> 01:48:37,480
You close the door so I can see The love you keep inside

1324
01:48:37,480 --> 01:48:44,480
The love you keep for me

1325
01:48:44,480 --> 01:48:54,480
It fills me up It feels like living in a dream

1326
01:48:57,480 --> 01:49:05,480
It fills me up so I can see The love you keep inside

1327
01:49:05,480 --> 01:49:12,480
Love you keep on me

1328
01:49:12,480 --> 01:49:22,480
I say to watch you fade away I dream of you tonight

1329
01:49:22,480 --> 01:49:29,480
Tomorrow you'll be gone It gives me time to say

1330
01:49:29,480 --> 01:49:36,480
To watch you fade away I dream of you tonight

1331
01:49:36,480 --> 01:49:39,980
Tomorrow you'll be gone

1332
01:49:39,980 --> 01:49:46,980
I wish my God would stay

1333
01:49:47,980 --> 01:49:50,980
I'll stay awake

1334
01:49:52,980 --> 01:49:56,980
I'll stay awake and watch you breathe

1335
01:49:59,980 --> 01:50:03,980
I'll stay awake and watch you come

1336
01:50:03,980 --> 01:50:14,980
Away into the night, I'll get through your dreams

1337
01:50:15,980 --> 01:50:24,980
I'll say to watch you fade away, I dream of you tonight

1338
01:50:24,980 --> 01:50:28,740
Tomorrow you'll be gone

1339
01:50:28,740 --> 01:50:31,940
It gives me time to say

1340
01:50:31,940 --> 01:50:35,460
To watch you fade away

1341
01:50:35,460 --> 01:50:38,900
I dream of you tonight

1342
01:50:38,900 --> 01:50:42,500
Tomorrow you'll be gone

1343
01:50:42,500 --> 01:50:49,940
I wish my God would stay

1344
01:50:49,940 --> 01:50:55,940
Hey

1345
01:50:57,940 --> 01:51:02,940
I stay to watch you fade away

1346
01:51:02,940 --> 01:51:05,940
I dream of you tonight

1347
01:51:05,940 --> 01:51:09,940
Tomorrow you'll be gone

1348
01:51:09,940 --> 01:51:12,940
It gives me time to stay

1349
01:51:12,940 --> 01:51:16,940
To watch you fade away

1350
01:51:16,940 --> 01:51:20,440
I dream of you tonight

1351
01:51:20,440 --> 01:51:23,940
Tomorrow you'll be gone

1352
01:51:23,940 --> 01:51:27,440
I wish by God you'd stay

1353
01:51:27,440 --> 01:51:30,940
To watch you fade away

1354
01:51:30,940 --> 01:51:34,440
I dream of you tonight

1355
01:51:34,440 --> 01:51:38,440
Tomorrow you'll be gone

1356
01:51:38,440 --> 01:51:43,440
I wish by god you'd say

1357
01:52:08,440 --> 01:52:15,440
was not as annoying as the usual one, so it gives a 7.

1358
01:52:38,440 --> 01:52:45,680
Alright, let us recap shall we, the three songs you can vote for tonight in tonight's

1359
01:52:45,680 --> 01:52:46,680

You can either vote for last week's winner, song number one, Blur with Crazy Beat, or

1361
01:52:58,280 --> 01:53:12,800
Or you can vote for song number 2, Alien number 613 with All For Nothing.

1362
01:53:12,800 --> 01:53:16,960
And song number 3 you can vote for tonight is The Second You Sleep by Stay To Watch You

1363
01:53:16,960 --> 01:53:23,960
fade away by Tess.

Please vote now. Send a private message to Skye in the chat room with your vote

1365
01:53:34,000 --> 01:53:37,920
for song numero uno dos or tres.

1366
01:53:37,920 --> 01:53:42,520
And we will see which song emerges victorious.

1367
01:53:42,520 --> 01:53:46,080
New Orleans Radio Cage. This is the part of the show where I go over to Loki and I say hey

1368
01:53:46,080 --> 01:53:50,580
Hey, Loki. You know that sim scene that's out there where people are like playing Beat

1369
01:53:50,580 --> 01:53:54,900
Mania on their PSPs and shit? What is going on in the sim scene? Because I could care

1370
01:53:54,900 --> 01:53:58,880
less, but I know our listeners want to know. So, Loki, what's up?

1371
01:53:58,880 --> 01:54:04,540
Just more stuff with DDR OSC4. They're now in their In the Groove division, and they

1372
01:54:04,540 --> 01:54:10,900
have the results for the keyboard division of sim files out there. I don't know what

1373
01:54:10,900 --> 01:54:14,840
the difference would be with In the Groove sim files. I guess that's not quite impossible,

1374
01:54:14,840 --> 01:54:22,520
but pretty impossible. I don't know. But anyways, if anyone cares, I will go into the results

1375
01:54:22,520 --> 01:54:28,080
here of who won the keyboard section, which I don't even really, I haven't checked out

1376
01:54:28,080 --> 01:54:34,360
any of the entries, so God knows. Oh, and it doesn't exist. Okay, anyways, in other...

1377
01:54:34,360 --> 01:54:37,840
That's one of those Bemani style bug things, like you can't log in on the forums or it

1378
01:54:37,840 --> 01:54:42,760
poops out. It's weird. Anyways, who cares? Someone won. I have a secret account on Bemani

1379
01:54:42,760 --> 01:54:49,760
I'm not actually Sky because somehow I got locked out of that account, like I can't get in it or access it all, so I have a secret name.

1380
01:54:49,760 --> 01:54:50,760
Secret!

1381
01:54:50,760 --> 01:54:58,760
Anyways, on top of that, the other thing was all these sim files for Ultramix 3 have been released.

1382
01:54:58,760 --> 01:55:00,760
All of them.

1383
01:55:00,760 --> 01:55:04,760
Oh good! That means all the MP3s are out there so people can stop whining for them.

1384
01:55:04,760 --> 01:55:06,760
Yes, they are. I have them.

1385
01:55:06,760 --> 01:55:16,760
But no, they're up there. You can find them at BomaniISO.com. I think that's what it was. Whatever that Bittorrent tracker was, it has all the stuff that people steal and stuff.

1386
01:55:18,760 --> 01:55:25,760
Yay. I don't know. That's all that's going on, really. Dead.

1387
01:55:26,760 --> 01:55:31,760
Alright. Well, it's Christmas. You know, everybody's taking a break from the sim scene because, you know, they're bored.

1388
01:55:31,760 --> 01:55:40,680
their board. What? However, we do have to, in a typical fashion, it is time to see how

1389
01:55:40,680 --> 01:55:49,060
many really bad Max remixes have been released this week, by myself. Anyways, this is starting

1390
01:55:49,060 --> 01:55:55,220
off. And of course, if you guys were looking for those 2DX distorted clips, you can actually

1391
01:55:55,220 --> 01:55:59,660
find them in their media shop. They have four different videos on there, so you can check

1392
01:55:59,660 --> 01:56:04,900
those out. But, if you really want to check out what everybody is looking for, and that's

1393
01:56:04,900 --> 01:56:10,920
really horrible Max remixes, you can also check those out in their Simphile form there.

1394
01:56:10,920 --> 01:56:16,160
And let's see, for this week, looks like it's been a pretty light week actually. We've got

1395
01:56:16,160 --> 01:56:24,160
MaxMax, MaxStink, Max340, MaxWizard, MaxAttack.

1396
01:56:24,160 --> 01:56:25,160
Twice.

1397
01:56:25,160 --> 01:56:26,160
MaxMyButt.

1398
01:56:26,160 --> 01:56:27,160
Yeah.

1399
01:56:27,160 --> 01:56:32,480
That would be it.

1400
01:56:32,480 --> 01:56:36,240
And Paranoia FartMix.

1401
01:56:36,240 --> 01:56:37,240
Not yet.

1402
01:56:37,240 --> 01:56:38,240
I didn't check and see who my Paranoia remixes are.

1403
01:56:38,240 --> 01:56:40,680
I'm still waiting for the Safari Transmix.

1404
01:56:40,680 --> 01:56:43,560
Keep waiting.

1405
01:56:43,560 --> 01:56:50,560
So get your safari transmix before I'll get my xbox 360.

1406
01:56:51,120 --> 01:56:54,680
And there it is.

1407
01:56:54,680 --> 01:56:59,640
I'd fill time but I'm tallying cage match votes so it's up to you guys for right now.

1408
01:56:59,640 --> 01:57:04,600
And of course, you know, to cover the wonderful Paranoia remixes we have Paranoia Survivor

1409
01:57:04,600 --> 01:57:11,600
Another, Paranoia Trick Master Edit, Paranoia Survivor Max 580, Paranoia Sky, Paranoia Agent

1410
01:57:11,600 --> 01:57:16,120
agent theme. That one I'm kind of interested in, let's see what that is.

1411
01:57:16,120 --> 01:57:27,120
Paranoia Eternal Frees. Paranoia Zombie, or, Ortelda Paranoia. Yeah. Nice. I don't know,

1412
01:57:27,120 --> 01:57:34,960
it's lame. I want Max the Final, and then I want Konami to threaten to sue anyone who

1413
01:57:34,960 --> 01:57:39,920
puts out another Max remix, and so people can't do it anymore. Because I just, I'm sick

1414
01:57:39,920 --> 01:57:45,680
max remixes. I really am. It's Maximizer now. Don't you know? Whatever. Fuck Maximizer.

1415
01:57:45,680 --> 01:57:50,840
Maximizer wasn't even a freaking Max remix at all. Fuck Maximizer. Fuck Joni and Spesh.

1416
01:57:50,840 --> 01:57:57,840
Max Super Max. Insaner. Max my ass. Whatever that is. Fuck Max. Fuck Legend of Max. Seriously.

1417
01:57:58,320 --> 01:58:02,680
They should call, they should make one called Extremer. What was the middle one? I don't

1418
01:58:02,680 --> 01:58:07,760
even remember what the real ones are called anymore. There was Max 300. Max Unlimited.

1419
01:58:07,760 --> 01:58:10,400
unlimited should've been where it stopped. That should've been the last one.

1420
01:58:10,400 --> 01:58:15,160
Now, The Legend of Max was a good place to stop it, because that was cool. It was kind

1421
01:58:15,160 --> 01:58:16,360
of a song to wrap it up.

1422
01:58:16,360 --> 01:58:17,360
Fine.

1423
01:58:17,360 --> 01:58:19,960
And Paranoia, like, Paranoia, Respect, that was a good one to end it on also.

1424
01:58:19,960 --> 01:58:20,960
Oh, fine. Then that should be it.

1425
01:58:20,960 --> 01:58:21,960
Then it should be done.

1426
01:58:21,960 --> 01:58:22,960
Done.

1427
01:58:22,960 --> 01:58:28,840
And same with B4U. B4U was a good point to stop, you know, those remakes as well.

1428
01:58:28,840 --> 01:58:36,200
And what the fuck was that Max song that was in the Max Heart Attack one in the extreme

1429
01:58:36,200 --> 01:58:37,200
Japan?

1430
01:58:37,200 --> 01:58:50,440
period. That was bullshit. That was absolute bullshit. Max period makes me on my period.

1431
01:58:50,440 --> 01:59:00,560
Alright. Anyway. We are going to go to a small break, and when we come back from this small

1432
01:59:00,560 --> 01:59:05,360
break, we might do some more Skype calls if you're good. Otherwise, we're going to do

1433
01:59:05,360 --> 01:59:08,320
FUs of the week so we'll see what kind of mood we're in when we come back from

1434
01:59:08,320 --> 01:59:14,760
this but we will do both at some point so don't get your panties in a bunch in

1435
01:59:14,760 --> 01:59:20,920
this break in celebration of angels new necklace we're going to do a couple LED

1436
01:59:20,920 --> 01:59:25,560
songs so we'll start it off with a little love is dreaminess and we'll be

1437
01:59:25,560 --> 01:59:32,560
back after this with more Orange Lounge.

1438
02:00:55,560 --> 02:01:00,560
Let's break it up with a little bit of my love and hate to fight

1439
02:01:00,560 --> 02:01:03,560
Come on and fight baby, it's my life

1440
02:03:03,560 --> 02:03:26,560
This is the end of the video, thank you for watching and I'll see you in the next one.

1441

Thanks for watching!

1442
02:05:33,560 --> 02:05:39,040
Song's in the description for rainforest music.

1443
02:06:03,560 --> 02:06:09,060
So I come into the world with dreams of old

1444
02:06:09,060 --> 02:06:14,560
Digging into the place with new old dreams

1445
02:06:14,560 --> 02:06:21,060
Open the door to true love

1446
02:06:21,060 --> 02:06:32,060
Go ahead and believe in the truth

1447
02:06:32,060 --> 02:06:38,720
Even more

1448
02:07:32,060 --> 02:07:42,060
Gaming Radio, so uncensored, that even Tom Brokaw could get a job with us.

1449
02:07:42,060 --> 02:07:44,060
Uh, Mooch, uh, Moochawky?

1450
02:07:44,060 --> 02:07:46,060
Orange Lounge Radio.

1451
02:07:46,060 --> 02:07:47,060
Tax Cunts.

1452
02:07:47,060 --> 02:07:53,060
He cracks me up every time. See, it sounds like he says Tax Cunts, get it?

1453
02:07:53,060 --> 02:07:56,060
It does, it totally does.

1454
02:07:56,060 --> 02:08:01,180
he does welcome back to orange on radio boys and girls LED in that break just

1455
02:08:01,180 --> 02:08:05,980
nothing but LED love his dreaminess nebula grasp or something wonderful

1456
02:08:05,980 --> 02:08:12,940
photogenic all in that break and being a comedic genius in the chat room I I saw

1457
02:08:12,940 --> 02:08:16,580
the the there's a to drink minimum suddenly in our chat room the comic

1458
02:08:16,580 --> 02:08:21,980
stylings of dark Sakura going on in our chat room right now but in fact I don't

1459
02:08:21,980 --> 02:08:26,100
don't know I I joined in a game here somebody just asked oh I'm not even

1460
02:08:26,100 --> 02:08:32,020
gonna try to pronounce this name I'm totally gonna butcher this. Milfululie

1461
02:08:32,020 --> 02:08:37,040
Milfululie I probably fucked that up says what's black and white and red all

1462
02:08:37,040 --> 02:08:40,640
over and everybody you know is putting their own answers I put a zebra that I

1463
02:08:40,640 --> 02:08:50,460
just shot Rini said a nun in a blender or a sunburnt penguin so everybody's a

1464
02:08:50,460 --> 02:09:15,220
p0k3smot42o

1465
02:09:15,220 --> 02:09:21,220
I guess I might as well acknowledge the fact that the one and only Lankystyle is sitting in the room with us right now. How you doing, Mr. Lankystyle?

1466
02:09:21,220 --> 02:09:22,220
Why'd you do that?

1467
02:09:22,220 --> 02:09:23,220
Why?

1468
02:09:23,220 --> 02:09:25,220
Now this show's just taking a big turn for the worse.

1469
02:09:25,220 --> 02:09:28,220
Oh, this show took a turn for the worse two and a half years ago.

1470
02:09:28,220 --> 02:09:35,220
Um, what, what, um, what's I, that's when Loki joined.

1471
02:09:35,220 --> 02:09:41,220
Um, what, what kind of games you been playing this week, my friend?

1472
02:09:41,220 --> 02:09:42,220
Oh.

1473
02:09:42,220 --> 02:09:45,220
Bring us back to talking about video games for a little bit.

1474
02:10:12,220 --> 02:10:16,700
long time to be sitting with a game, seriously. Even though it's only like probably... I'm

1475
02:10:16,700 --> 02:10:23,420
probably like not even... I'm having to scratch the surface of that game. I know I haven't.

1476
02:10:23,420 --> 02:10:27,380
And that's fine. At least I'm getting my money's worth. But I know that I will probably completely

1477
02:10:27,380 --> 02:10:32,820
ignore Dragon Quest this week when Animal Crossing comes out. That's true. Animal Crossing.

1478
02:10:32,820 --> 02:10:36,820
That is looking pretty good. I mean, I haven't been doing a lot of reading on the features,

1479
02:10:36,820 --> 02:10:41,100
but I mean... Who gives a shit? I know it has the online... Who gives a shit? It's online,

1480
02:10:41,100 --> 02:10:45,240
it's Animal Crossing and I get a bug net. But I'm wondering if it's going to be fresh

1481
02:10:45,240 --> 02:10:50,120
enough to keep me into it longer than I was the original.

1482
02:10:50,120 --> 02:10:53,600
Everybody else stays on the phone. Internet, meep, meep.

1483
02:10:53,600 --> 02:10:56,960
That's true. You know, that would be great. I think in

1484
02:10:56,960 --> 02:11:04,520
Animal Crossing there should be a day called I kill everyone day and I go and I shoot the

1485
02:11:04,520 --> 02:11:07,040
people I don't like in the village and then cook them for dinner.

1486
02:11:07,040 --> 02:11:11,760
That was like the greatest Animal Crossing day ever.

1487
02:11:11,760 --> 02:11:17,240
You get the like, come here Olivia, razor-wired bug net.

1488
02:11:17,240 --> 02:11:20,040
You get to hit them over the head with.

1489
02:11:20,040 --> 02:11:24,960
It's battle royale day on Animal Crossing.

1490
02:11:24,960 --> 02:11:27,240
I told my foo-poo joke.

1491
02:11:27,240 --> 02:11:28,880
What's this, dare I ask?

1492
02:11:28,880 --> 02:11:30,400
Okay, I'll repeat it.

1493
02:11:30,400 --> 02:11:33,200
How dare you interrupt my Animal Crossing rant, by the way.

1494
02:11:33,200 --> 02:11:37,320
You will be in the Animal Battle Royale final decision.

1495
02:11:37,320 --> 02:11:39,840
My Animal Crossing has been pre-ordered already.

1496
02:11:39,840 --> 02:11:40,840
Alright.

1497
02:11:40,840 --> 02:11:41,840
Alright.

1498
02:11:41,840 --> 02:11:42,840
What's the joke?

1499
02:11:42,840 --> 02:11:43,840
Okay.

1500
02:11:43,840 --> 02:11:44,840
I'm going to have to retell it.

1501
02:11:44,840 --> 02:11:48,880
These explorers, there's a legend of a bird called the Fupu Bird.

1502
02:11:48,880 --> 02:11:50,320
I've told you this one before.

1503
02:11:50,320 --> 02:11:51,880
I think so.

1504
02:11:51,880 --> 02:11:55,880
Anyway, the legend is that anyone who goes after the Fupu Bird disappears.

1505
02:11:55,880 --> 02:11:58,380
So three explorers decide they're going to find it.

1506
02:11:58,380 --> 02:12:00,960
One goes one way and two go off the other way.

1507
02:12:00,960 --> 02:12:07,780
And so the one who is by himself, he hears this, and then he finds he's got poo on his

1508
02:12:07,780 --> 02:12:08,780
head.

1509
02:12:08,780 --> 02:12:09,780
So he wipes it off.

1510
02:12:09,780 --> 02:12:10,780
And he vanishes.

1511
02:12:10,780 --> 02:12:16,520
So the other two are together, and all of a sudden they hear, and one of them looks

1512
02:12:16,520 --> 02:12:18,320
up in time to get shot on in the face.

1513
02:12:18,320 --> 02:12:19,320
So he wipes it off.

1514
02:12:19,320 --> 02:12:20,320
That's no fun.

1515
02:12:20,320 --> 02:12:21,320
And he disappears.

1516
02:12:21,320 --> 02:12:26,240
And the other one is like, oh no, and he starts running off because he saw how it happened.

1517
02:12:26,240 --> 02:12:30,520
And so right before he gets to the end of the jungle, and he's got poo on his head.

1518
02:12:30,520 --> 02:12:33,680
He's like, well crap, I know if I wipe this off I'm going to disappear.

1519
02:12:33,680 --> 02:12:38,080
So he goes home with shit on his head. And he goes home to his wife and she goes,

1520
02:12:38,080 --> 02:12:41,720
why do you have crap on your head? He's like, because if you wipe off the poo-poo of the

1521
02:12:41,720 --> 02:12:43,320
foo-poo bird, then you'll disappear.

1522
02:12:43,320 --> 02:12:48,160
Okay, well, we'll live with it. So they go to bed. But the stink is so bad that she has to wipe it off

1523
02:12:48,160 --> 02:12:48,800
of his head.

1524
02:12:48,800 --> 02:12:52,560
So when she does, it disappears. So you know what the moral of the story is?

1525
02:12:52,560 --> 02:12:59,560
What? If the two shits wear it.

1526
02:13:03,760 --> 02:13:07,360
Please don't quit your day job. I wish I could.

1527
02:13:07,360 --> 02:13:11,880
Oh my god, that was so bad!

1528
02:13:11,880 --> 02:13:15,760
It was so bad! So very bad! It was bad, bad, bad!

1529
02:13:15,760 --> 02:13:19,320
Wow, that brings me back to World 4S Forward.

1530
02:13:19,320 --> 02:13:24,080
And that makes me want to go watch, that makes me want to go watch Deuce Bigelow European

1531
02:13:24,080 --> 02:13:32,280
Gigolo just so I can hear something funny, maybe.

1532
02:13:32,280 --> 02:13:35,680
Now that the show has been ruined, thank you.

1533
02:13:35,680 --> 02:13:36,680
You laughed.

1534
02:13:36,680 --> 02:13:39,320
Get the fooshits, Jesus Christ.

1535
02:13:39,320 --> 02:13:44,080
Alright, um, that is definitely an opportunity for us to go into the F.U.

1536
02:13:44,080 --> 02:13:45,080
Zooey.

1537
02:13:45,080 --> 02:13:47,600
Hey, I told the one-eyed-whore joke too.

1538
02:13:47,600 --> 02:13:48,600
The one-eyed-whore joke?

1539
02:13:48,600 --> 02:13:51,600
You know what, I'm not even going to ask.

1540
02:13:51,600 --> 02:13:58,600
I'm simply going to go to the FUs of the week, and Jamie, why is it that we do these FUs of the week every single week?

1541
02:14:03,600 --> 02:14:06,600
YEAH DAH!

1542
02:14:06,600 --> 02:14:18,280
The first FU of the week goes to Rob for not finding my joke hilarious, which it was and

1543
02:14:18,280 --> 02:14:20,280
you know it.

1544
02:14:20,280 --> 02:14:25,680
The second FU of the week goes toward certain aspects of my employment, which I am not at

1545
02:14:25,680 --> 02:14:29,840
liberty to discuss.

1546
02:14:29,840 --> 02:14:36,840
The other aspect goes toward me for not having the money that I want to have right now.

1547
02:14:36,840 --> 02:14:39,840
And traffic. I hate traffic in this area.

1548
02:14:39,840 --> 02:14:45,840
And also a humongous SU goes to superficiality.

1549
02:14:45,840 --> 02:14:47,840
And that's it.

1550
02:14:49,840 --> 02:14:50,840
One more.

1551
02:14:50,840 --> 02:14:51,840
Yeah, I was going to say that was short.

1552
02:14:51,840 --> 02:14:54,840
And having the plague. Because I feel it coming up on me again.

1553
02:14:54,840 --> 02:14:56,840
Oh god.

1554
02:14:56,840 --> 02:15:01,840
Alright, uh, let's go over to Loki!

1555
02:15:01,840 --> 02:15:03,840
Okay.

1556
02:15:03,840 --> 02:15:08,840
Anyways, um, let's start off my FUs of the week.

1557
02:15:08,840 --> 02:15:13,840
Um, I'm actually kind of, this is not anything that has to do with me.

1558
02:15:13,840 --> 02:15:17,840
My sister's house was actually broken into by some guy in broad daylight.

1559
02:15:17,840 --> 02:15:21,840
Now this is how retarded this guy is, and this is kind of funny.

1560
02:15:21,840 --> 02:15:23,840
The guy was breaking into the house in broad daylight.

1561
02:15:23,840 --> 02:15:28,400
like. People observed him breaking into the house. First he tried the garage door and

1562
02:15:28,400 --> 02:15:32,600
couldn't pry it open with his crowbar. Tried the front door, couldn't pry it open with

1563
02:15:32,600 --> 02:15:37,960
his crowbar. Tried kicking in the front door, still couldn't get it. Tried the side door,

1564
02:15:37,960 --> 02:15:46,960
couldn't get that. Finally he tried breaking the bedroom window, got in through there and

1565
02:15:46,960 --> 02:15:56,700
stole some costume jewelry, and then left. Thereby netting absolutely nothing. So, fuck

1566
02:15:56,700 --> 02:16:00,700
you stupid, retarded people. Not only that, he stopped traffic as he was running across

1567
02:16:00,700 --> 02:16:06,800
the street to escape, you know, being caught even though he was already seen, but he did

1568
02:16:06,800 --> 02:16:15,540
get away because the cops took an hour to respond. Thank you, Carmichael PD. Anyways,

1569
02:16:15,540 --> 02:16:36,540
fucking to Microsoft for fucking up both, not only the US launch of the 360, but now the UK launch, and I know you're going to go for three with the Japanese launch, but too bad the Japanese don't give a shit about your system because all the wonderful games are coming out for it, like the wonderful RPGs and DOA4 and stuff.

1570
02:16:36,540 --> 02:16:39,540
Oh yeah, those aren't coming out launched because they're delayed now, thank you very much.

1571
02:16:39,540 --> 02:16:50,040
much. But hey, they can play Madden because Madden rocks, I guess. Also, fuck you to GameStop

1572
02:16:50,040 --> 02:16:54,800
for not getting anymore shipments in of the 360. I know it's not their fault, but still

1573
02:16:54,800 --> 02:16:58,760
though, they said I was halfway down the list. They lied to me. I was actually towards the

1574
02:16:58,760 --> 02:17:04,680
bottom of the list, so fuck them for not knowing what halfway means. And also, fuck you to

1575
02:17:04,680 --> 02:17:08,040
stupid people driving your cars because you can't

1576
02:17:08,040 --> 02:17:16,040
and women do not need to be driving SUVs because they're obviously too big for them to handle

1577
02:17:16,040 --> 02:17:17,080
wow

1578
02:17:17,080 --> 02:17:19,400
yeah fuck them

1579
02:17:19,400 --> 02:17:22,480
stupid useless vehicles

1580
02:17:22,480 --> 02:17:23,800
they could uh...

1581
02:17:23,800 --> 02:17:25,560
save that japanese uh...

1582
02:17:25,560 --> 02:17:30,180
xbox 360 launch if they would just make a arnold swartzenegger game

1583
02:17:30,180 --> 02:17:45,540
love Arnold Schwarzenegger in Japan. Go play my game! Do it now! Goveneta! Okay. All right,

1584
02:17:45,540 --> 02:17:57,180
I'm done. Okay, I guess that means it's now my turn. Um, I would say an F you just to

1585
02:17:57,180 --> 02:18:01,460
the fact that I've just been feeling like shit all week and I've just been doing some

1586
02:18:01,460 --> 02:18:07,260
crazy things and the fact that I've just had lack of sleep and just been overall just feeling

1587
02:18:07,260 --> 02:18:14,260
rather blah and I don't know. Eff you to the fact that I'm just an angsty person and just

1588
02:18:17,000 --> 02:18:21,380
eff you to the fact that it's Christmas time and this time of year always sucks. It just

1589
02:18:21,380 --> 02:18:26,140
does. I hope Santa, I better not say that because the FBI will come after me. I hope

1590
02:18:26,140 --> 02:18:30,140
I hope Santa brings me a bomb for Christmas so I can blow some people up.

1591
02:18:30,140 --> 02:18:32,140
But I'm not really meaning that. I don't mean that.

1592
02:18:32,140 --> 02:18:35,140
Now you do have the turban for that.

1593
02:18:35,140 --> 02:18:38,140
That is horrible. That is horrible.

1594
02:18:38,140 --> 02:18:39,140
Alright.

1595
02:18:39,140 --> 02:18:42,140
Not really. I hope it's a bomb full of confetti.

1596
02:18:42,140 --> 02:18:44,140
So I can show you my love.

1597
02:18:44,140 --> 02:18:49,140
Full of wonderful radioactive confetti.

1598
02:18:49,140 --> 02:18:53,140
I'm on some list now.

1599
02:18:53,140 --> 02:18:58,140
I can always do what the major retailers are doing, that's just crash a float into somebody.

1600
02:18:58,140 --> 02:19:00,140
Yeah, that sounds like fun.

1601
02:19:00,140 --> 02:19:07,140
I want somebody to build me a spongebob bomb of air. Hot air. That'd be fun.

1602
02:19:07,140 --> 02:19:10,140
I think there's already enough hot air in the government.

1603
02:19:10,140 --> 02:19:16,140
Alright, let's go to Brad. I'm sure Brad has some FUs that he wants to get out of his system.

1604
02:19:16,140 --> 02:19:20,140
Sure, why not? What do you call a deer with no eyes? No-eye deer.

1605
02:19:20,140 --> 02:19:24,140
What do you call a deer with no eyes and no legs? Still no idea.

1606
02:19:24,140 --> 02:19:27,140
There's my refuse of the week.

1607
02:19:27,140 --> 02:19:31,140
Well, if we were going with corny jokes for the night, then I figured it out.

1608
02:19:31,140 --> 02:19:33,140
You are fucking lame.

1609
02:19:33,140 --> 02:19:37,140
Uh, Angel, don't run away. What's your refuse of the week?

1610
02:19:37,140 --> 02:19:40,140
Um, yeah.

1611
02:19:40,140 --> 02:19:46,140
A few people that didn't say happy birthday, but you guys did, so you guys love me. Yay!

1612
02:19:46,140 --> 02:19:48,140
Yay!

1613
02:19:48,140 --> 02:19:50,140
namagem1 I don't know, what else?

1614
02:19:50,140 --> 02:19:52,140
namagem1 Oh yeah, it's been hella cold, what the hell?

1615
02:19:52,140 --> 02:19:54,140
namagem1 I can't really say that though

1616
02:19:54,140 --> 02:20:00,140
namagem1 because people in other areas of the United States are colder, so whatever

1617
02:20:00,140 --> 02:20:04,140
namagem1 But I've been cold, so you know what, yeah, whatever

1618
02:20:04,140 --> 02:20:07,140
namagem1 Uh, who didn't go? Anyone?

1619
02:20:07,140 --> 02:20:11,140
namagem1 Okay, I'm just talking to myself. Bye

1620
02:20:11,140 --> 02:20:15,140
namagem1 Okay, um, Rise Princess, do you have anything you want to get out of your system?

1621
02:20:45,140 --> 02:20:59,820
F.U. to early morning shifts during the holidays and an F.U. to people I work with for they

1622
02:20:59,820 --> 02:21:07,400
are SO STUPID and they supposed to be salesmen for the love of mike

1623
02:21:07,400 --> 02:21:12,180
sakurina says F.U. to konami of hawaii you whores for removing the fuck from guideca

1624
02:21:12,180 --> 02:21:16,140
How dare you? It sounds like shit now that you shitheads get the fuck out of my life.

1625
02:21:16,140 --> 02:21:18,820
F you to lame puns since that's all I do.

1626
02:21:18,820 --> 02:21:23,180
And yeah, F you to my mom for switching from OSX to Windows. What the fuck is wrong with you?

1627
02:21:23,180 --> 02:21:28,500
And F you to Loki for saying women can't drive SUVs.

1628
02:21:28,500 --> 02:21:30,380
Truth hurts, right?

1629
02:21:30,380 --> 02:21:31,700
Blow walk.

1630
02:21:31,700 --> 02:21:36,620
Not as much as a woman hitting you with her SUV.

1631
02:21:36,620 --> 02:21:43,180
sent me something over private messages that was not a nephew.

1632
02:21:43,180 --> 02:21:47,180
Tomokun says your website says that Mario Mix is discontinued, but according to this

1633
02:21:47,180 --> 02:21:51,280
article from Joystiq, the game was not discontinued, it is just selling out.

1634
02:21:51,280 --> 02:21:55,240
If you read the article that I posted on the site, you would see that I said the exact

1635
02:21:55,240 --> 02:21:56,240
same thing.

1636
02:21:56,240 --> 02:21:59,480
But they are saying that it's coming back in March.

1637
02:21:59,480 --> 02:22:02,760
Yes, well that means it's discontinued until March.

1638
02:22:02,760 --> 02:22:03,760
Duh.

1639
02:22:03,760 --> 02:22:10,260
crochet. Tomoku would also like to say, fuck Xbox 360. Well said. NintendoManiac64 says,

1640
02:22:10,260 --> 02:22:14,880
F you to my DS's L button. I can't play some of my GBA games on my DS efficiently now.

1641
02:22:14,880 --> 02:22:19,880
F you to Mario Kart DS disconnectors that disconnect at the end of races. F you to my

1642
02:22:19,880 --> 02:22:24,480
parents that don't really trust ordering things online at all. Now how else am I supposed

1643
02:22:24,480 --> 02:22:28,760
to use this Playstation DDR pad when I don't even have a PS2? Besides, StepMania isn't

1644
02:22:58,760 --> 02:23:05,560
game to play 2DX. Dark Tetsuya says, one last F.U. to AOL. Can't say I'll miss any of the

1645
02:23:05,560 --> 02:23:09,520
following. The random disconnects, the out of memory errors, and the constant lockups.

1646
02:23:09,520 --> 02:23:18,520
Uh, yes? I have actually one more. Okay. An F.U. to Xbox 360 for freezing. You know they

1647
02:23:18,560 --> 02:23:23,000
say only 3% of Xbox 360s are supposed to be doing that. You're lucky. You're a liar. You're

1648
02:23:23,000 --> 02:23:28,080
a winner motion is that who says f you to getting up this morning to go to the

1656
02:24:00,260 --> 02:24:02,100
at the mall entrance.

1657
02:24:02,100 --> 02:24:06,180
People are like lalala pulling in, oh shit there's only one lane now.

1658
02:24:06,180 --> 02:24:11,740
Also F you to the Java IRC chat because it made me late getting to the chat.

02:24:11,740 --> 02:24:17,420
Neodude says F you to Nintendo Wi-Fi connection because I can't connect to a WPA protected

1660
02:24:17,420 --> 02:24:18,900
network with a DS.

1661
02:24:18,900 --> 02:24:22,380
I have to buy the USB connector for $35.

1662
02:24:22,380 --> 02:24:25,060
Big Power says, F you to the yearly December break

1663
02:24:25,060 --> 02:24:26,500
that many TV shows go on with.

1664
02:24:26,500 --> 02:24:28,660
They have a long break with no new episodes.

1665
02:24:28,660 --> 02:24:30,460
I want my Lost and Prison break.

1666
02:24:30,460 --> 02:24:33,740
Oh, and Watch 24 when it comes back on.

1667
02:24:33,740 --> 02:24:38,620
Goggle says, F the whole college application process.

1668
02:24:38,620 --> 02:24:39,500
And F back payment.

1669
02:24:42,540 --> 02:24:46,420
GS191 says, F you to my workplace for playing that

1670
02:24:46,420 --> 02:24:50,820
damn rent song over and over and over again last week. At least they were playing Daft

1671
02:24:50,820 --> 02:24:55,980
Punk's Technologic. Now we're playing sucky Christmas music now with crappy pop remixes.

1672
02:24:55,980 --> 02:25:01,180
A late F you to Black Friday and stupid customers ask me where are the iPods, GPS, random shit

1673
02:25:01,180 --> 02:25:04,980

1674
02:25:04,980 --> 02:25:11,980
map we gave you. Zander C says F you to Jamie's lame jokes. You need to try to slap him. You

1675
02:25:41,980 --> 02:25:46,380
And lastly, Spiritsnare would like to say an F you to Xbox 360.

1676
02:25:46,380 --> 02:25:50,380
F you to RENT because it has some of the most addicting songs I've ever heard on their soundtrack.

1677
02:25:50,380 --> 02:25:55,780
F you to the Final Fantasy Potions because they probably will never make it over here, except at anime conventions.

1678
02:25:56,780 --> 02:25:58,180
Also an F you to N-

1679
02:26:00,580 --> 02:26:04,980
At $30 and not $20, even though they're not decent ports.

1680
02:26:07,380 --> 02:26:10,180
Damn, you bitches are angsty tonight, that's all I have to say.

1681
02:26:10,180 --> 02:26:16,060
wow wow wow wow the chat room is turned into bra chat oh really and what kind of

1682
02:26:16,060 --> 02:26:19,980
things have we learned about bras apparently underwear keeps you from

1683
02:26:19,980 --> 02:26:24,100
being droopy like grandma when you're old I you know I I'm glad that my

1684
02:26:24,100 --> 02:26:27,580
underwear does not have metal wires in it because that might be painful worst

1685
02:26:27,580 --> 02:26:32,540
invention ever you know and I bet I do recall from you know I used I used to

1686
02:26:32,540 --> 02:26:36,060
hate girls and sometimes we'd get you know we get shut up why is everybody

1687
02:26:36,060 --> 02:26:43,180
You know, we used to get a little freaky, and I used to go shopping with a girl and

1688
02:26:43,180 --> 02:26:45,380
your girlfriends doesn't mean you're dating them.

1689
02:26:45,380 --> 02:26:46,380
No, no, no.

1690
02:26:46,380 --> 02:26:50,500
I actually, I used to take girls' bras off, and I remember it was a pain in the ass to

1691
02:26:50,500 --> 02:26:51,500
do.

1692
02:26:51,500 --> 02:26:52,500
Like, it's...

1693
02:26:52,500 --> 02:26:53,500
You need to...

1694
02:26:53,500 --> 02:26:54,500
That was the sign right there.

1695
02:26:54,500 --> 02:26:55,500
Seriously!

1696
02:26:55,500 --> 02:26:56,500
That's how I knew I was gay.

1697
02:26:56,500 --> 02:26:59,580
I was like, fuck this bra shit, I'm just gonna suck dick.

1698
02:26:59,580 --> 02:27:01,660
That's easy.

1699
02:27:01,660 --> 02:27:03,660
It's not that hard.

1700
02:27:03,660 --> 02:27:04,660
That's easy.

1701
02:27:04,660 --> 02:27:05,660
It's not that hard.

1702
02:27:05,660 --> 02:27:12,560
way she figured out. It's not that hard when she figured out. Seriously. I know. I just,

1703
02:27:12,560 --> 02:27:16,560
you know. You get to the point where you can just look at a broad and it pops off. Look,

1704
02:27:16,560 --> 02:27:21,560
I give up easy. I give up easy, okay? I'm a quitter. I just, I take the lazy way out.

1705
02:27:21,560 --> 02:27:30,160
Alright. What? What's so damn funny? Rob is more interested in putting him on than taking

1706
02:27:30,160 --> 02:27:36,560
him off. No way. Take that both ways if you want. No, that is the gay stereotype I do

1707
02:27:36,560 --> 02:27:44,680
not do, okay? Every gay...no, no, no. Every gay person I know fits into some gay stereotype.

1708
02:27:44,680 --> 02:27:48,900
There's some gay stereotype. Wait, wait, wait, wait. Even Shane. What? What was that one

1709
02:27:48,900 --> 02:27:54,080
time at the other apartment when I came back from the pool and there was people wearing

1710
02:27:54,080 --> 02:27:59,120
bras with, like, water balloon or condom, like, breasts? Not me. Not me. That was my

1711
02:27:59,120 --> 02:28:03,860
surprise birthday party there was a dress involved that I didn't I didn't

1712
02:28:03,860 --> 02:28:08,300
wear a bra it was a bitch and ho party and it was that was the whole theme it

1713
02:28:08,300 --> 02:28:13,420
was I I'm just hoping you wasn't getting like hot and bothered off of it that's

1714
02:28:13,420 --> 02:28:18,500
all no you weren't wearing a bra no I wasn't no no I was the pimp of the party

1715
02:28:18,500 --> 02:28:24,460
everybody else was a bitch and ho I see what I can't understand how you can like

1716
02:28:24,460 --> 02:28:31,460
teach, you know, PPOs and HMOs and all that complicated crap, but you can't unhook three

1717
02:28:31,520 --> 02:28:36,520
little hooks from a bra. No, like seriously? The girls I used to date would have like the

1718
02:28:36,520 --> 02:28:41,240
20-hook bras. It was horrible. It was like... The 20-hook bras. Yes. But were they grandmas

1719
02:28:41,240 --> 02:28:46,560
or something? I guess. You liked older women? I don't know. Mating gorillas? No! I was dating

1720
02:28:46,560 --> 02:28:49,420
very nice women that had bras with 20-hooks on them. I don't know, in some respects, that

1721
02:28:49,420 --> 02:28:54,440
might not be a bad thing since that involves, you know, Damon Alberd. Oh, stop it. So,

1722
02:28:54,440 --> 02:28:57,640
20 hooks, so what are they, monkey people or something?

1723
02:28:57,640 --> 02:29:00,240
No, they just, it was a complicated bra.

1724
02:29:00,240 --> 02:29:05,240
I would like you to make my, my wonderful friend...

1725
02:29:05,240 --> 02:29:14,240
They need to make bra, you know what, why don't they make, here's a novel concept.

1726
02:29:14,240 --> 02:29:17,440
Why don't they make what? No, no, let me finish.

1727
02:29:17,440 --> 02:29:21,640
Why don't they make a bra out of Velcro? Wouldn't that be easy?

1728
02:29:21,640 --> 02:29:23,640
Just rip, and there we go!

1729
02:29:23,640 --> 02:29:25,640
Because Velcro doesn't hold for shit?

1730
02:29:25,640 --> 02:29:27,640
No, didn't...

1731
02:29:27,640 --> 02:29:32,640
You know what? I know some girls on the itty bitty titty committee who they would work just fine for.

1732
02:29:32,640 --> 02:29:35,640
But that's the whole point, like...

1733
02:29:35,640 --> 02:29:45,640
Sorry, the fact that you wouldn't mind pulling a bra off of an itty bitty titty committee applicant shows that you're gay, but whatever.

1734
02:29:45,640 --> 02:29:54,040
I completely forgot what I was going to say. Oh, I know. Well, you shouldn't have dated

1735
02:29:54,040 --> 02:29:59,720
girls who were girdles. They weren't girdles. They were just, they were bras. If there's

1736
02:29:59,720 --> 02:30:05,760
20 hooks, it'd have to be a girdle. I don't know. Maybe, maybe in my mind, maybe they

1737
02:30:05,760 --> 02:30:10,360
weren't really 20 hooks, but in my mind, like, I've gone back, yeah, I'm like having nightmares

1738
02:30:10,360 --> 02:30:14,360
of the bras and like they're like like I remember looking at the back and it's

1739
02:30:14,360 --> 02:30:27,160
like don't you dare touch me what Rob has bra phobia I do he has those dreams

1740
02:30:27,160 --> 02:30:31,560
where it's really abstract he looks at it and it just like it the hooks go down

1741
02:30:31,560 --> 02:30:37,160
towards the horizon they're just never-ending just bra strap that's like

1742
02:30:37,160 --> 02:30:42,160
my hell. It's like, here, do you want to get into the gates of heaven? Just unhook the

1743
02:30:42,160 --> 02:30:48,120
door that's very similar to a bra. Oh, it's going to be my hell, where I have to spend

1744
02:30:48,120 --> 02:30:51,280
my eternity trying to figure out how to open up the goddamn door to heaven because they

1745
02:30:51,280 --> 02:30:56,840
have it like a bra. First they make you straight, so that you want to get through the bra anyway,

1746
02:30:56,840 --> 02:31:02,520
and then, yeah, and you can't. There you go. And then you have sex with women, and oh man,

1747
02:31:02,520 --> 02:31:05,760
that's crazy hell. Yeah, he's going to have sex, then he's about to have sex with a woman

1748
02:31:05,760 --> 02:31:13,280
becomes gay. And, again. Yeah, anyway, I don't like all this talk about me and my

1749
02:31:13,280 --> 02:31:17,440
bra thing. I'm just writing my movie, that's all. Your movie? What's your movie?

1750
02:31:17,440 --> 02:31:21,400
Do you want to plug your movie? The Life of Rob. That's what people do on

1751
02:31:21,400 --> 02:31:24,920
shows, is they plug things. So you have a movie coming out you want to put on? No, you don't?

1752
02:31:24,920 --> 02:31:29,280
Not yet. Okay. Are you writing one? Maybe someday. Do you want to pitch one? No. We have important

1753
02:31:29,280 --> 02:31:31,900
people listen to this program

1754
02:31:31,900 --> 02:31:33,740
mother

1755
02:31:33,740 --> 02:31:35,080
uh...

1756
02:31:35,080 --> 02:31:36,360
uh...

1757
02:31:36,360 --> 02:31:37,420
sorry

1758
02:31:37,420 --> 02:31:40,980
there was something that listeners couldn't be but whatever that radio

1759
02:31:40,980 --> 02:31:42,600
was funny

1760
02:31:42,600 --> 02:31:45,080
the times

1761
02:31:45,080 --> 02:31:47,920
and of course now our chat room just suddenly

1762
02:31:47,920 --> 02:31:52,080
fills up with all this chap rob rob rob rob rob rob rob rob rob rob rob rob

1763
02:31:52,080 --> 02:31:53,560
but rob rob rob rob rob rob rob

1764
02:31:53,560 --> 02:31:58,660
but we were talking about bras before we got on the verbal topic i don't

1765
02:31:58,660 --> 02:32:02,620
Okay, anyways. What? Oh, yes. Low-key. Something related to video gaming.

1766
02:32:02,620 --> 02:32:05,300
No, I didn't have anything. I was just gonna... I was just gonna say...

1767
02:32:05,300 --> 02:32:08,620
Very rare bear.

1768
02:32:08,620 --> 02:32:12,140
Love the inside joke. I need a break.

1769
02:32:12,140 --> 02:32:16,060
At least it's not cake pie. We're gonna do a break, and then we're gonna come back...

1770
02:32:16,060 --> 02:32:18,980
We're gonna come back, and we're gonna do some Skype.

1771
02:32:18,980 --> 02:32:22,060
Skype atcha, comin' atcha.

1772
02:32:22,060 --> 02:32:23,060
And then, um,

1773
02:32:23,060 --> 02:32:26,620
Ask Orange Lounge, because we know you want to ask us some questions, and

1774
02:32:26,620 --> 02:32:27,540
therefore,

1775
02:32:27,540 --> 02:32:29,540
We want to give you some answers.

1776
02:32:29,540 --> 02:32:31,540
Does that sound like a plan?

1777
02:32:31,540 --> 02:32:33,540
Sounds like a plan. I hope so.

1778
02:32:33,540 --> 02:32:35,540
We'll be back after this. We're going to start off

1779
02:32:35,540 --> 02:32:37,540
this break with the

1780
02:32:37,540 --> 02:32:39,540
the new Naoki song.

1781
02:32:39,540 --> 02:32:41,540
Brilliant R.E.D.

1782
02:32:41,540 --> 02:32:43,540
as opposed to Brilliant

1783
02:32:43,540 --> 02:32:45,540
Purple or something else.

1784
02:32:45,540 --> 02:32:52,540
or brilliant, brilliant B.R.A.

1785
02:33:15,540 --> 02:33:24,540
I knew the first time I saw you out on the floor

1786
02:33:24,540 --> 02:33:27,540
Yes, that you were so much more

1787
02:33:27,540 --> 02:33:31,540
It's just the way that you move your body with mine

1788
02:33:31,540 --> 02:33:34,540
Feels like we had no concept of time

1789
02:33:34,540 --> 02:33:38,540
It's just the way that you do, that's what we do

1790
02:33:38,540 --> 02:33:44,540
I wanna show you how much we can lose

1791
02:33:44,540 --> 02:33:47,740
This is the night made for just you and I

1792
02:33:47,840 --> 02:33:50,820
This is the night, won't you take me inside

1793
02:33:50,820 --> 02:33:53,900
This is the night, now look into my eye

1794
02:33:53,900 --> 02:33:57,340
I want you, I need you, to make it alright

1795
02:33:57,340 --> 02:34:00,280
This is the night like the last of our lives

1796
02:34:00,300 --> 02:34:03,580
This is the night when you Jersey

1797
02:34:03,580 --> 02:34:06,620
This is the night made for just you and I

1798
02:34:06,620 --> 02:34:09,900
I want you, I need you to hold on tight

1799
02:34:39,900 --> 02:34:42,900
Why?

1800
02:34:42,900 --> 02:34:45,900
Leave me alone, so tell me why

1801
02:34:45,900 --> 02:34:49,900
Everyone needs to carry on

1802
02:34:49,900 --> 02:34:54,900
Leave me alone if I'm not right

1803
02:34:54,900 --> 02:34:56,900
And why?

1804
02:34:56,900 --> 02:34:59,900
Leave me alone so many days

1805
02:34:59,900 --> 02:35:03,900
You're thinking of you so many times

1806
02:35:03,900 --> 02:35:08,900
Leave me alone if I'm not right

1807
02:35:08,900 --> 02:35:10,900
Don't tell me why

1808
02:35:15,900 --> 02:35:17,900
Don't tell me why

1809
02:36:47,900 --> 02:36:49,900
Hooray!

1810
02:36:49,900 --> 02:36:51,900
Hooray!

1811
02:36:59,900 --> 02:37:01,900
Hooray!

1812
02:38:01,900 --> 02:38:12,900
Death inside, candlelight, my despair in gloom I'm just no pretty scene, I'm considered a truth

1813
02:38:12,900 --> 02:38:19,900
So far, it's dark, can't you feel my pain? People are all the same, they actually make my way

1814
02:38:19,900 --> 02:38:26,900
Cast a ghost right to the center of my heart

1815
02:38:26,900 --> 02:38:32,900
I am frozen from the sky

1816
02:38:35,900 --> 02:38:38,900
I am garbage, I am jail

1817
02:38:38,900 --> 02:38:42,900
I am scary, I am sane

1818
02:38:42,900 --> 02:38:45,900
I'm a loner, I am cold

1819
02:38:45,900 --> 02:38:49,900
I feel safe to when people don't know

1820
02:38:49,900 --> 02:38:52,900
I am nothing, I am dead

1821
02:38:52,900 --> 02:38:56,900
I am scary, I am insane

1822
02:38:56,900 --> 02:38:59,900
I am loner, I am cold

1823
02:38:59,900 --> 02:39:05,900
No, I didn't think that we were gonna fall

1824
02:39:29,900 --> 02:39:38,020
Oh, there I am. Next time, remember to unmute the mics.

1825
02:39:38,020 --> 02:39:40,540
Skype line is open, boys and girls. If you want to give us a call, we're going to give

1826
02:39:40,540 --> 02:39:44,420
you a few minutes to get in on Skype. Also, we're going to be doing some Ask Orange Lounge.

1827
02:39:44,420 --> 02:39:47,260
So if you're not so much feeling the Skype thing, you want to ask us some questions,

1828
02:39:47,260 --> 02:39:51,340
we are taking submissions in chat right now for Ask Orange Lounge. We don't have a lot

1829
02:39:51,340 --> 02:39:57,020
of time for Ask Orange Lounge, but we want to at least get a couple questions answered

1830
02:39:57,020 --> 02:40:00,800
because, you know, with it being the holiday season, perhaps there's some things you want

1831
02:40:00,800 --> 02:40:05,420
to know about Christmas. Now, Jamie is showing off all these cool toys she has, which makes

1832
02:40:05,420 --> 02:40:09,420
me insanely jealous. Can I play with this one? What is this? Tell the listeners what

1833
02:40:09,420 --> 02:40:14,340
I'm playing with. Um, someone left it in Dan's store, so he gave it to me. It's an R2D2 that

1834
02:40:14,340 --> 02:40:19,660
shows the picture of Princess Leia. That is so cool. Like, when I push it, like, I show

1835
02:40:19,660 --> 02:40:24,940
it on the wall. It's Princess Leia, with a bun. That is so badass. And then I have lots

1836
02:40:24,940 --> 02:40:29,340
of drugs. I don't want one. And I have, like, the most awesome keychain, uh, uh, cell phone

1837
02:40:29,340 --> 02:40:34,220
strap. What is that now, on the cell phone strap? I have prints. From Katamari Damashi.

1838
02:40:34,220 --> 02:40:38,060
No, no, no, no, no, no. Now you just need the ringtones, and then you'd be a total addict

1839
02:40:38,060 --> 02:40:42,220
there. Oh, I can get those, or midis. Alright. Let's go to a call, huh? You're on Orange

1840
02:40:42,220 --> 02:40:47,260
Lounge Radio, who dis? It's the one and only Ron Chan, what's up fellas? Hello Ron Chan,

1841
02:40:47,260 --> 02:40:51,140
how are you? I'm doing good, I'm doing good. I ju- I just wanna point out, though, Dark

1842
02:40:51,140 --> 02:40:54,580
Dark Sakura is not a fella.

1843
02:40:54,580 --> 02:40:55,580
I know, I know.

1844
02:40:55,580 --> 02:40:57,180
I have that effect on women.

1845
02:40:57,180 --> 02:40:58,180
I'm sorry.

1846
02:40:58,180 --> 02:41:00,060
That's alright.

1847
02:41:00,060 --> 02:41:02,180
I've seen you hanging with the ladies, Ronja.

1848
02:41:02,180 --> 02:41:03,180
Not really.

1849
02:41:03,180 --> 02:41:04,180
Just a couple.

1850
02:41:04,180 --> 02:41:05,180
But, no.

1851
02:41:05,180 --> 02:41:06,180
I don't know where I'm going with that.

1852
02:41:06,180 --> 02:41:07,180
Anyway.

1853
02:41:07,180 --> 02:41:11,340
I don't think it would be possible to mistake me for a dude since I have humongous boobs.

1854
02:41:11,340 --> 02:41:13,380
Does your bra have twenty hooks on it?

1855
02:41:13,380 --> 02:41:14,380
No, Rob.

1856
02:41:14,380 --> 02:41:15,380
Just three.

1857
02:41:15,380 --> 02:41:16,380
Okay.

1858
02:41:16,380 --> 02:41:17,380
What about Velcro?

1859
02:41:17,380 --> 02:41:18,380
What do you think?

1860
02:41:18,380 --> 02:41:19,380
Never mind.

1861
02:41:19,380 --> 02:41:20,380
Forget it.

1862
02:41:20,380 --> 02:41:22,380
What's on your mind?

1863
02:41:22,380 --> 02:41:26,380
Uh, not much. I'm still addicted to Mario Kart DS.

1864
02:41:26,380 --> 02:41:33,380
It is a fun game. Do you actually find friends online to play against? Because I never do, unless I set it up on Instant Messenger.

1865
02:41:33,380 --> 02:41:40,380
That's the only way. If I'm in a chat room with a bunch of us, that's how we do it. And even half the time, we can't even race each other.

1866
02:41:40,380 --> 02:41:45,380
Wow. Oh, because you don't find each other on the game or something, or what?

1867
02:41:45,380 --> 02:41:54,380
We don't find each other. There's like, one time there was like five of us, we were going to try to get at least four of us in a race, it turned out to be me and two people. Or me and one person.

1868
02:41:54,380 --> 02:42:01,380
That's weird. So it didn't, it can't find your friends or something? Maybe the lag was too great or something.

1869
02:42:01,380 --> 02:42:06,380
What lag? I mean, I do this at work and the router's like six feet behind me.

1870
02:42:06,380 --> 02:42:09,380
I don't know what to tell you, buddy. I'm sorry.

1871
02:42:09,380 --> 02:42:15,260
I'm not too worried about it, but I can say this with my DS. I found I found plenty of

1872
02:42:15,820 --> 02:42:17,820
Wireless networks around my neighborhood

1873
02:42:18,540 --> 02:42:24,460
Yeah, I found one up. I was at um the rice princess and lanky styles apartment not that long ago, and I tapped into a

1874
02:42:25,260 --> 02:42:31,380
Wireless network near them and that made me feel like elite hacker. It was cool. I was stealing bandwidth. I could go to jail

1875
02:42:33,100 --> 02:42:36,900
Hey, I call it sharing the wealth are you gonna be getting animal crossing?

1876
02:42:36,900 --> 02:42:39,660
Maybe in a couple of weeks.

1877
02:42:39,660 --> 02:42:40,660
Alright.

1878
02:42:40,660 --> 02:42:46,420
Well, when you get it, you, me, bike racks, three o'clock, bring your bug net, it's on.

1879
02:42:46,420 --> 02:42:47,420
Bring it.

1880
02:42:47,420 --> 02:42:48,420
Bring it.

1881
02:42:48,420 --> 02:42:49,420
It's already been brought in, my friend.

1882
02:42:49,420 --> 02:42:50,420
Alright.

1883
02:42:50,420 --> 02:42:51,420
Oh, yeah.

1884
02:42:51,420 --> 02:42:54,500
One thing from last week, you were talking about Casticon.

1885
02:42:54,500 --> 02:42:55,500
Yes.

1886
02:42:55,500 --> 02:42:59,420
I went to Casticon and we got snowed in for two days.

1887
02:42:59,420 --> 02:43:04,100
If I get snowed in at this crazy convention in D.C., which I will be going to, it sounds

1888
02:43:04,100 --> 02:43:08,260
I have the time approved off work. All I have to do is get a plane ticket, which are very affordable right now

1889
02:43:08,420 --> 02:43:13,940
So I'm gonna be booking that sometime this week. I just need to discuss travel arrangements with you my friend

1890
02:43:14,940 --> 02:43:21,580
Sure, no problem. If I get snowed in I'm gonna cry. I am from California. I've lived in California my entire life. I don't do snow

1891
02:43:22,240 --> 02:43:29,460
Do you know this? I have never this might this is gonna be a crazy concept some of you people I have never seen snow

1892
02:43:29,460 --> 02:43:36,300
falling from the sky in person. Never. I haven't. That was in Alabama. Never. I've never seen

1893
02:43:36,300 --> 02:43:41,220
snow falling from the sky. That was like way down south in Alabama. That was in Mobile.

1894
02:43:41,220 --> 02:43:44,460
I've seen snow once it's already on the ground. It's not that hard to drive up to Reno and

1895
02:43:44,460 --> 02:43:49,780
see some snow here where we live. But I've never seen snow fall from the sky. Every time

1896
02:43:49,780 --> 02:43:53,180
it's happened in Sacramento, like the two times it's ever happened since I've been alive,

1897
02:43:53,180 --> 02:43:58,820
I was either asleep or the one other time it ever happened I was doing an internet radio

1898
02:43:58,820 --> 02:44:01,940
show, believe it or not, at the old college station. Crazy, huh?

1899
02:44:01,940 --> 02:44:07,220
We're gonna have to get a wee hair last night. Alright, well, it better not snow, cause I

1900
02:44:07,220 --> 02:44:09,460
don't know what to do. I will cry like a little girl.

1901
02:44:09,460 --> 02:44:14,940
No, what'll happen is they'll shut down the airport and get out a day later.

1902
02:44:14,940 --> 02:44:19,940
Oh my god, I will poop myself if that happens. I don't know how to deal with that. I don't

1903
02:44:19,940 --> 02:44:22,500
do flight delays. Alright.

1904
02:44:22,500 --> 02:44:26,060
That happened to a bunch of West Coast that came at Castle Con 9 two years ago.

1905
02:44:26,060 --> 02:44:28,060
Stop scaring me!

1906
02:44:29,060 --> 02:44:30,060
Alright, we gotta go. We gotta take more calls.

1907
02:44:30,060 --> 02:44:32,060
You beat it, bro! Not that bad.

1908
02:44:32,060 --> 02:44:36,060
We gotta take more calls. And you're, you're freaking me out. I'm gonna have nightmares tonight about snow.

1909
02:44:36,060 --> 02:44:38,060
Alright. Take care, my friend.

1910
02:44:39,060 --> 02:44:40,060
There, bye.

1911
02:44:40,060 --> 02:44:41,060
Bye.

1912
02:44:42,060 --> 02:44:44,060
Alright, and everybody in the chatroom going,

1913
02:44:44,060 --> 02:44:49,060
Sky, you big baby! Sky, you're a baby! You need to stop being such a baby about snow!

1914
02:44:49,060 --> 02:44:54,060
Come to Colorado! Come to New York! Come here! Watch the snow!

1915
02:44:54,060 --> 02:44:55,060
No thank you, I live in California for real.

1916
02:44:55,060 --> 02:44:57,060
I have to just go to Reno.

1917
02:44:57,060 --> 02:44:58,060
I know.

1918
02:44:58,060 --> 02:44:59,060
All right.

1919
02:44:59,060 --> 02:45:01,900
Yeah, we're about ready to go to lightning round pretty soon here, but no, we'll get

1920
02:45:01,900 --> 02:45:02,900
one at least.

1921
02:45:02,900 --> 02:45:06,340
Oh, I was just about to pick up that call and dude hung up.

1922
02:45:06,340 --> 02:45:08,540
I was just about to click the little thing.

1923
02:45:08,540 --> 02:45:10,500
Oh, there he is.

1924
02:45:10,500 --> 02:45:11,500
He's back now.

1925
02:45:11,500 --> 02:45:14,060
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

1926
02:45:14,060 --> 02:45:17,060
Hello, you are on Orange Lounge Radio.

1927
02:45:17,060 --> 02:45:18,060
Hello.

1928
02:45:18,060 --> 02:45:19,060
Hello.

1929
02:45:19,060 --> 02:45:22,660
Bienvenidos, Orange Lounge Radio.

1930
02:45:22,660 --> 02:45:24,660
What's on your mind?

1931
02:45:24,660 --> 02:45:26,660
What is on your mind, my friend?

1932
02:45:26,660 --> 02:45:28,660
Um...

1933
02:45:28,660 --> 02:45:30,660
Dang.

1934
02:45:30,660 --> 02:45:32,660
First off, who the hell is this?

1935
02:45:32,660 --> 02:45:34,660
Who is this?

1936
02:45:34,660 --> 02:45:36,660
Santa from Florida.

1937
02:45:36,660 --> 02:45:38,660
Oh, hi Santa from Florida. What's on your mind?

1938
02:45:38,660 --> 02:45:40,660
Um...

1939
02:45:40,660 --> 02:45:42,660
I don't know if this is what I should do, but I wanted to bring up the

1940
02:45:42,660 --> 02:45:44,660
Nintendo Revolution not supporting

1941
02:45:44,660 --> 02:45:46,660
HDTV thingy real quick.

1942
02:45:46,660 --> 02:45:48,660
Uh, sure. What's up?

1943
02:45:48,660 --> 02:45:50,660
Well...

1944
02:45:50,660 --> 02:45:52,660
Um...

1945
02:45:52,660 --> 02:45:58,380
reason they're doing it is well for one reason because they're using standard

1946
02:45:58,380 --> 02:46:04,420
DVDs I think it's not really smart to be doing HD because I mean you're seeing

1947
02:46:04,420 --> 02:46:10,380
with the Xbox 360 with them oblivion or yeah oblivion it's like gonna take up

1948
02:46:10,380 --> 02:46:15,300
four discs or something like that that's one thing another thing is the cost I

1949
02:46:15,300 --> 02:46:19,340
mean it's just gonna be ridiculous cost to small developers to try to put HD in

1950
02:46:19,340 --> 02:46:29,340
I somewhat agree with you. I also think the reason why they're not doing it is because Loki has me convinced that the revolution is the fact that there is going to be stereoscopic 3D.

1951
02:46:29,340 --> 02:46:32,340
And they just don't want to do that for HDTV. That would cost too much.

1952
02:46:32,340 --> 02:46:39,340
I heard you say that too. I don't know if they're going to do that. I think they cost too much.

1953
02:46:39,340 --> 02:46:40,340
I don't know.

1954
02:46:40,340 --> 02:46:43,340
I don't think it would fit in their $200 price range thingy.

1955
02:46:43,340 --> 02:46:48,700
If they have a good development kit, all you need is some 3D World Runner all over again,

1956
02:46:48,700 --> 02:46:49,700
Rad Racer.

1957
02:46:49,700 --> 02:46:55,660
Can somebody explain to me what the fuck the point was of 3D and Rad Racer?

1958
02:46:55,660 --> 02:46:57,260
It did like nothing for that game.

1959
02:46:57,260 --> 02:46:59,620
3D and Rad Racer did nothing.

1960
02:46:59,620 --> 02:47:00,620
It was so rad.

1961
02:47:00,620 --> 02:47:03,540
It was... shut up.

1962
02:47:03,540 --> 02:47:04,540
You know what?

1963
02:47:04,540 --> 02:47:05,540
You bring up some good points.

1964
02:47:05,540 --> 02:47:09,660
And I, owning an HDTV, it makes me sad that Nintendo is not supporting it.

1965
02:47:09,660 --> 02:47:14,960
Remember, if they're doing it for cost reasons, and if they're doing it for these other reasons

1966
02:47:14,960 --> 02:47:19,400
that they plan to do more crazy shit with their system, I'm okay with it.

1967
02:47:19,400 --> 02:47:23,720
But remember the golden rule, a system is only as good as games.

1968
02:47:23,720 --> 02:47:25,040
Wow, we've got the whole event saying that now.

1969
02:47:25,040 --> 02:47:28,960
Well, here's the other thing also, is, you know, just because they say they're not supporting

1970
02:47:28,960 --> 02:47:34,080
HD does not mean that the, it just means they're not supporting the formats of HD, you know,

1971
02:47:34,080 --> 02:47:35,860
the aspect ratios and stuff.

1972
02:47:35,860 --> 02:47:38,240
So it could be something completely different also.

1973
02:47:38,240 --> 02:47:42,220
Maybe they'll still support progressive scan and widescreen. That would be okay. Maybe

1974
02:47:42,220 --> 02:47:47,360
they'll support 480, what would that be, 480p. That's okay. There's some pretty good looking

1975
02:47:47,360 --> 02:47:51,720
games at 480p. If it, maybe you're right. Maybe the fact that they're not doing HDTV

1976
02:47:51,720 --> 02:47:56,460
means they're not going to support 1080p or something. That's okay. As long as my games

1977
02:47:56,460 --> 02:48:00,920
can have some widescreen in it and some progressive, dammit, some progressive scan, some widescreen,

1978
02:48:00,920 --> 02:48:03,800
that would be kind of cool. But I'm not going to hold my breath with Nintendo here.

1979
02:48:03,800 --> 02:48:04,800
there.

1980
02:48:04,800 --> 02:48:05,800
Yeah.

1981
02:48:05,800 --> 02:48:10,280
Well, they're supposed to announce more, um, did you hear the, uh, that they have another

1982
02:48:10,280 --> 02:48:11,680
big secret, apparently?

1983
02:48:11,680 --> 02:48:12,680
Well, yeah.

1984
02:48:12,680 --> 02:48:15,120
Yeah, that it's stereoscopic 3D.

1985
02:48:15,120 --> 02:48:20,280
No, they're saying, they're saying, uh, there's, Miyamoto did another speech.

1986
02:48:20,280 --> 02:48:24,520
Oh, yeah, yeah, I heard, I read some more than Miyamoto did another speech.

1987
02:48:24,520 --> 02:48:28,680
Yeah, just to add to your argument, somebody posted this on LJ and I saw this, Miyamoto

1988
02:48:28,680 --> 02:48:32,940
did another speech and said there's a, there's another secret coming that you kids don't

1989
02:48:32,940 --> 02:48:36,880
know about, so just you wait for it. Everyone thinks it's about the controller because he

1990
02:48:36,880 --> 02:48:40,660
was talking about the controller at the time, but I don't think it is. I think it's still

1991
02:48:40,660 --> 02:48:46,040
the stereoscopic 3D thing. What did he say about the controller? What else could they

1992
02:48:46,040 --> 02:48:51,040
say about the controller? That you're going to use it in the stereoscopic 3D games. Well,

1993
02:48:51,040 --> 02:48:57,880
no. Maybe you're onto something. We'll see. I don't know. And maybe we're fucking idiots.

1994
02:48:57,880 --> 02:49:02,880
I don't know. We'll see soon enough. But it's fun to imagine, isn't it?

1995
02:49:02,880 --> 02:49:03,880
Go away for a drink.

1996
02:49:03,880 --> 02:49:07,880
Yeah, we will. We'll be first in line. Hopefully they won't kick us out.

1997
02:49:07,880 --> 02:49:11,880
All right. We're going to let you go, buddy. We got to get to the next segment, all right?

1998
02:49:11,880 --> 02:49:14,880
But thank you for your input. Have a good one.

1999
02:49:14,880 --> 02:49:16,880
You too. Later.

2000
02:49:16,880 --> 02:49:23,880
Okay, I apologize to those folks we didn't get to on Skype. We'll get to you guys next week.

2001
02:49:23,880 --> 02:49:25,580
promise

2002
02:49:25,580 --> 02:49:32,540
But we promise the chatters we did get to some ask orange lounge. So therefore that's what we're gonna do right now some ask orange lounge

2003
02:49:39,700 --> 02:49:46,460
Let's ask orange lounge some stupid question. What will we find out this week on orange lounge radio?

2004
02:49:47,140 --> 02:49:52,140
Maybe we'll find out how to unhook a bra or maybe not. I

2005
02:49:52,140 --> 02:49:57,140
I don't know. I don't want to finish that thought. Um...

2006
02:49:57,140 --> 02:49:58,140
You rhymed anyway.

2007
02:49:58,140 --> 02:50:01,140
Sakurina says,

2008
02:50:01,140 --> 02:50:07,140
I want to plug dsmeat.com, which is a DS Friends code sharing site that Loki joined, apparently.

2009
02:50:07,140 --> 02:50:09,140
Loki, is this true? Are these allegations true?

2010
02:50:09,140 --> 02:50:12,140
Yeah, but I haven't visited the site since then. I was bored.

2011
02:50:12,140 --> 02:50:15,140
I thought our buddy Big Red Pimp started his own thing.

2012
02:50:15,140 --> 02:50:20,140
Yeah, and you know what's funny is because I couldn't log into that thing at all because it was broken.

2013
02:50:20,140 --> 02:50:24,140
email him and tell him he'll fix it. I just don't care. He loves you. Alright, uh,

2014
02:50:24,140 --> 02:50:30,780
Sakarina wants to know, am I the only one to think Snow by Ram when you guys talk about snow?

2015
02:50:32,620 --> 02:50:37,340
And I say no, you're probably not the only one to think about that song. However, that does make you

2016
02:50:37,340 --> 02:50:47,820
a loser. Just kidding. Hearts, love you. Just kidding. Sephiroth1215 says, what do you think

2017
02:50:47,820 --> 02:50:50,820
What do you think is the most overrated DDR song?

2018
02:50:50,820 --> 02:50:53,820
I say Butterfly, says Sephiroth1215.

2019
02:50:53,820 --> 02:50:55,820
Most overrated DDR song?

2020
02:50:55,820 --> 02:50:57,820
Max 300, hands down.

2021
02:50:57,820 --> 02:50:59,820
Hands down, Max 300.

2022
02:50:59,820 --> 02:51:00,820
Darkstalker?

2023
02:51:00,820 --> 02:51:02,820
Yeah, I'd have to agree.

2024
02:51:02,820 --> 02:51:03,820
Max 300? Loki.

2025
02:51:03,820 --> 02:51:04,820
Huh?

2026
02:51:04,820 --> 02:51:06,820
Most overrated DDR song?

2027
02:51:06,820 --> 02:51:09,820
Overrated DDR song, max period.

2028
02:51:09,820 --> 02:51:10,820
Oh.

2029
02:51:10,820 --> 02:51:11,820
We all said maxes.

2030
02:51:11,820 --> 02:51:14,820
And will you be my Animal Crossing friend?

2031
02:51:14,820 --> 02:51:15,820
Aww.

2032
02:51:15,820 --> 02:51:17,820
Only if you let me abuse your town folk.

2033
02:51:19,820 --> 02:51:21,820
I'm going to leave signs in your town.

2034
02:51:21,820 --> 02:51:23,820
Yeah, and let us paint your town.

2035
02:51:24,820 --> 02:51:26,820
We'll paint your town gay.

2036
02:51:27,820 --> 02:51:29,820
We're going to come gay up your town.

2037
02:51:30,820 --> 02:51:32,820
With the makeover, girlfriend!

2038
02:51:37,820 --> 02:51:39,820
I'm going to put up signs and just have bras on them.

2039
02:51:40,820 --> 02:51:42,820
That should be the new Orange Lounge logo.

2040
02:51:42,820 --> 02:51:46,660
the new orange lounge logo I really hope that the town lesbian comes back by the

2041
02:51:46,660 --> 02:51:49,100
way I want to say just in time for Christmas because I don't know why bras

2042
02:51:49,100 --> 02:51:55,060
make me think of this but the orange lounge t-shirt it's gonna happen we got

2043
02:51:55,060 --> 02:51:59,100
a company to say they do it I'm very excited so we're gonna talk about that

2044
02:51:59,100 --> 02:52:04,860
later gonna do it we're gonna do it illusion wants to know what do you think

2045
02:52:04,860 --> 02:52:09,940
is truly truly truly outrageous gem in the holograms or the misfits not the

2046
02:52:09,940 --> 02:52:18,020
punk band, the original Misfits. I would say, you know, Jem was the shit. The Misfits were

2047
02:52:18,020 --> 02:52:23,660
just a bunch of fucking wannabes. I'm sorry. Except the Misfits had Jetta later on, and

2048
02:52:23,660 --> 02:52:29,100
she played a black saxophone. True. It doesn't get cooler than that. Your thoughts, Jem or

2049
02:52:29,100 --> 02:52:38,020
the Misfits? I think the entire show sucked. Yeah, well, I think you smell like butt. Spirit

2050
02:52:38,020 --> 02:52:44,100
Snare would like to know what is the meaning of life the universe and

2051
02:52:44,100 --> 02:52:53,900
everything to the X 42 purple it's 42 really purple that's the whole purpose

2052
02:52:53,900 --> 02:52:58,820
of the earth was to calculate the meaning of life and it's 42 purple Loki

2053
02:52:58,820 --> 02:53:03,660
the meaning of life is to listen to orange launch radio every Sunday night

2054
02:53:03,660 --> 02:53:06,380
at 6.30 Pacific Standard Time?

2055
02:53:06,380 --> 02:53:07,820
Um, no.

2056
02:53:07,820 --> 02:53:11,340
Oh, Jesus Christ, Renee just reminded me of something.

2057
02:53:11,340 --> 02:53:13,620
Have any of the hosts had a memorable moment?

2058
02:53:13,620 --> 02:53:14,360
Oh, this is from Renee.

2059
02:53:14,360 --> 02:53:19,500
Playing any DDR or music game in front of a crowd of sorts.

2060
02:53:19,500 --> 02:53:22,140
I have an alter ego known as Dr. Dick that

2061
02:53:22,140 --> 02:53:24,100
does improv freestyle at some tournaments

2062
02:53:24,100 --> 02:53:28,380
and got quite a big crowd at Pier 39 doing.

2063
02:53:28,380 --> 02:53:29,300
What song did I do?

2064
02:53:29,300 --> 02:53:31,660
Was it Cowgirl I did at that one?

2065
02:53:31,660 --> 02:53:33,420
No, the first time was It's Raining Men.

2066
02:53:33,420 --> 02:53:36,620
Yeah. Was it Shaft 2 or something? Yeah, Shaft.

2067
02:53:36,620 --> 02:53:40,380
And the second time Dr. Dick came out was doing Cowgirl

2068
02:53:40,380 --> 02:53:43,820
at B3 is what it was called. Good times.

2069
02:53:43,820 --> 02:53:46,860
Loki, I think of one involving you.

2070
02:53:46,860 --> 02:53:50,820
One of the first times I met you was at the sacramentals cosplay and tournament

2071
02:53:50,820 --> 02:53:54,820
and you did your routine Dynamite Rave, like when you were dressed up all over your style.

2072
02:53:54,820 --> 02:53:57,540
Oh yeah, I completely forgot. And you fucking failed.

2073
02:53:57,540 --> 02:54:02,740
That's because I forgot my steps. You started dancing and you were like getting down and doing the whole thing and then you were like

2074
02:54:02,740 --> 02:54:05,740
Like you froze for a minute and you were like, aw shit, and then you failed.

2075
02:54:05,740 --> 02:54:07,740
I wasn't like, what, the first time you...

2076
02:54:07,740 --> 02:54:13,740
I was like, that guy rocked. No, it was, it was later on. But this is pre-OLR. This is pre-OLR.

2077
02:54:15,740 --> 02:54:21,740
Alright. DarkSakura, do you have any? I can think of one. It was you and me, but...

2078
02:54:21,740 --> 02:54:23,740
What, doing stomp to my beat?

2079
02:54:23,740 --> 02:54:24,740
Yeah.

2080
02:54:24,740 --> 02:54:26,740
And beating each other with the orange bats?

2081
02:54:26,740 --> 02:54:30,020
because we were pissed off that we got disqualified from perfect attack so we

2082
02:54:30,020 --> 02:54:33,580
entered freestyle couples freestyle at the last minute and we went to Rite Aid

2083
02:54:33,580 --> 02:54:38,260
and bought big orange bats and a little plastic trumpet and we worked we worked

2084
02:54:38,260 --> 02:54:41,580
so hard on this we were so like we finished this whole freestyle routine a

2085
02:54:41,580 --> 02:54:44,940
couple of hours I believe this video is still still on DDR freak somewhere

2086
02:54:44,940 --> 02:54:49,740
somewhere somewhere nobody needs to download yeah yeah I was really fat and

2087
02:54:49,740 --> 02:54:52,500
this is what I looked like like four years ago you wanna see how gay I really

2088
02:54:52,500 --> 02:54:57,500
I'm watching me dance. We worked really hard on the finishing technique where Dark Sakura

2089
02:54:57,500 --> 02:55:01,840
would whack me in the crotch with her bat, and that was the finishing move. It was great.

2090
02:55:01,840 --> 02:55:06,440
And then Iguana Girl and some other guy. Her ex. Yeah, that guy. Yeah. Stood behind us

2091
02:55:06,440 --> 02:55:10,240
and played instruments. The little plastic trumpet. Yeah, the trumpets and stuff. It

2092
02:55:10,240 --> 02:55:20,520
was great. Because, you know, in some of my videos, and please help us spread the new

2093
02:55:20,520 --> 02:55:29,240
slang term for boobs, katamaris. Enjoy. And who won the cage match is the thing he reminded

2094
02:55:29,240 --> 02:55:33,020
me of. Oh yeah, you guys want to know who won a cage match tonight, huh? Because I completely

2095
02:55:33,020 --> 02:55:37,940
forgot to mention it a little bit ago. Tonight's cage match wiener is by, I think this is by

2096
02:55:37,940 --> 02:55:47,380
one vote. Yes, by only one vote. Kat. Let's face it, you've missed her from DDR, that's

2097
02:55:47,380 --> 02:55:52,340
why you let her win all right thank you for reminding me Renee God if it wasn't

2098
02:55:52,340 --> 02:55:56,820

2101
02:56:10,160 --> 02:56:14,340

where right there starting right there

2106
02:56:35,860 --> 02:56:44,860
I think he meant why did I type that with a D when it should have been a G.

2107
02:56:44,860 --> 02:56:51,860
Okay, it's supposed to be S-U-K-O.

2108
02:56:51,860 --> 02:56:54,860
Oh, who cares.

2109
02:56:54,860 --> 02:56:56,860
I'm trying to say it's Koshi.

2110
02:56:56,860 --> 02:56:57,860
Oh, who cares.

2111
02:56:57,860 --> 02:57:00,860
No, I need to correct you, thank you.

2112
02:57:00,860 --> 02:57:08,180
Nintendo Maniac, what he really wants to know, is a Mario Kart DS online record of 199 wins

2113
02:57:08,180 --> 02:57:09,860
and 34 losses good?

2114
02:57:09,860 --> 02:57:13,460
Yeah, but it means you do need to go outside more often.

2115
02:57:13,460 --> 02:57:14,460
Maybe race a real car.

2116
02:57:14,460 --> 02:57:15,460
Just kidding.

2117
02:57:15,460 --> 02:57:16,460
Just kidding.

2118
02:57:16,460 --> 02:57:17,460
Question for Loki.

2119
02:57:17,460 --> 02:57:18,780
Can I race you in Mario Kart DS again?

2120
02:57:18,780 --> 02:57:22,140
I remember that you're anti-snaking, Loki.

2121
02:57:22,140 --> 02:57:27,900
I guess if I'm on, I mean.

2122
02:57:27,900 --> 02:57:31,740
jaded 2005 what is the best metal DER pad because I want to get one for

2123
02:57:31,740 --> 02:57:41,420
Christmas red octane's afterburner honestly Roz why wouldn't the Java IRC

2124
02:57:41,420 --> 02:57:44,780
client work I couldn't get into it and it made me late for the show chat

2125
02:57:44,780 --> 02:57:48,460
sadness I don't know because that's done by another company but I'll look into it

2126
02:57:48,460 --> 02:57:52,580
and see if it's just you or if it breaks for us too and if it breaks for us too

2127
02:57:52,580 --> 02:58:00,420
then we'll have to, uh, spank it. Sephiroth1215, by the way, had a follow-up.

2128
02:58:00,420 --> 02:58:09,420
That's okay if we want to visit his village, but please don't gay it up.

2129
02:58:09,420 --> 02:58:15,260
Legend of Zaku says, how come mainstream youth media outlets such as MTV only care about

2130
02:58:15,260 --> 02:58:19,860
rap and sports games? Because that, unfortunately, is what the people are buying, and if the

2131
02:58:19,860 --> 02:58:24,580
people stop buying that shit they will not promote it anymore is my thought

2132
02:58:24,580 --> 02:58:34,180
because of cock yeah cock what what she got you to say cock oh by the way I have a

2133
02:58:34,180 --> 02:58:37,340

minutes left in the show and I don't have a fortune cookie and I forgot to

2137
02:58:48,700 --> 02:58:50,700
Very, very Margaret Cho gave.

2138
02:59:18,700 --> 02:59:29,680

Sakura all right you have outgave me that's just my favorite song movie all

2141
02:59:46,340 --> 02:59:48,660
All right, question from Dark Tetsuya.

2142
02:59:48,660 --> 02:59:50,780
Have you seen the Carl's Jr. Milkshake commercial,

2143
02:59:50,780 --> 02:59:53,580
and do you find it ironic that they used Get Busy

2144
02:59:53,580 --> 02:59:55,740
since they had the DDR promotion last month?

2145
02:59:58,060 --> 03:00:00,700
Well, that would not be busy.

2146
03:00:00,700 --> 03:00:03,100
That thing, miss, cannot, cannot shake.

2147
03:00:03,100 --> 03:00:05,460
That thing, miss, cannot, cannot shake.

2148
03:00:05,460 --> 03:00:06,300
That thing, miss, cannot, cannot shake.

2149
03:00:06,300 --> 03:00:10,460
You know, I can't, look, why would you use,

2150
03:00:10,460 --> 03:00:14,060
why would you use that song when there's the completely

2151
03:00:14,060 --> 03:00:21,060
The more obvious song that you use in your milkshake commercial.

2152
03:00:21,060 --> 03:00:26,060
My milkshake brings all the boys to the yard, and their life is better than yours.

2153
03:00:26,060 --> 03:00:28,060
Damn right, it's better than yours.

2154
03:00:28,060 --> 03:00:30,060
Cause most people listen to, you know...

2155
03:00:30,060 --> 03:00:34,060
Wait, hold on, hold on.

2156
03:00:34,060 --> 03:00:36,060
E. Carl's Jr.

2157
03:00:36,060 --> 03:00:41,060
See? I should produce commercials.

2158
03:00:41,060 --> 03:00:46,980

2159
03:00:46,980 --> 03:00:50,620

2161
03:00:54,500 --> 03:01:01,060
a close second my favorite one is dancing around a women's underwear okay

2162
03:01:01,060 --> 03:01:04,060
Okay. Loki? Christmas at Ground Zero.

2163
03:01:04,060 --> 03:01:07,060
It's Christmas at Ground Zero.

2164
03:01:07,060 --> 03:01:08,060
Alright. One more.

2165
03:01:08,060 --> 03:01:11,060
Actually, I also like the night Santa went crazy.

2166
03:01:11,060 --> 03:01:13,060
Last one, last one.

2167
03:01:13,060 --> 03:01:18,060
Neodude0 wants to know, do any of you play Magic the Gathering?

2168
03:01:18,060 --> 03:01:19,060
I used to.

2169
03:01:19,060 --> 03:01:20,060
I used to.

2170
03:01:20,060 --> 03:01:22,060
I had, I had like all blackboarded cards.

2171
03:01:22,060 --> 03:01:24,060
They were betas and alphas.

2172
03:01:24,060 --> 03:01:26,060
I still have my fourth edition stuff.

2173
03:01:26,060 --> 03:01:28,060
NERD!

2174
03:01:28,060 --> 03:01:33,060
Yeah, but I don't play it anymore. I can play sometimes.

2175
03:01:33,060 --> 03:01:38,060
Sometimes late at night, you take them out, and you tickle yourself with them.

2176
03:01:38,060 --> 03:01:43,060
Actually... Oh dear.

2177
03:01:43,060 --> 03:01:46,060
I need to tap my mana. Tap my mana.

2178
03:01:46,060 --> 03:01:49,060
I need another Thrall token!

2179
03:01:49,060 --> 03:01:51,060
At least I didn't say Felden's Cane.

2180
03:01:51,060 --> 03:01:54,060
Oh gee, god damn lady.

2181
03:01:54,060 --> 03:01:57,060
I need me an acid manipulator.

2182
03:01:57,060 --> 03:02:05,620
Alright. That, uh, I hate this show. Alright. That, that's, that's gonna do it because I

2183
03:02:05,620 --> 03:02:09,740
hate this show. Uh, we're gonna finish up and, uh, put the nail in the proverbial coffin

2184
03:02:09,740 --> 03:02:14,180
of this program. Uh, thank you, folks, for listening. We'll be back next week with more

2185
03:02:14,180 --> 03:02:21,460
of the same shit that you know and love. Um, final thought time. Angel! I hope you had

2186
03:02:21,460 --> 03:02:27,020
a good show. Yes, I did. Good. And good people came over and it was all good. Good. Well,

2187
03:02:27,020 --> 03:02:30,020
What's your final thought, my dear?

2188
03:02:30,020 --> 03:02:32,020
Must get that job.

2189
03:02:32,020 --> 03:02:33,020
Yes.

2190
03:02:33,020 --> 03:02:36,020
Good luck, my friend. Loki, final thought.

2191
03:02:36,020 --> 03:02:37,020
Must eat more brownies.

2192
03:02:37,020 --> 03:02:39,020
Stop stuffing your face with brownies.

2193
03:02:39,020 --> 03:02:41,020
How much weight have you gained since the biggest gainer started?

2194
03:02:41,020 --> 03:02:42,020
I don't know. I haven't checked.

2195
03:02:42,020 --> 03:02:44,020
We haven't done weigh-ins in my weeks.

2196
03:02:44,020 --> 03:02:46,020
I know. Well, Extover's not here, so...

2197
03:02:46,020 --> 03:02:49,020
But I've been uber-sick, so...

2198
03:02:49,020 --> 03:02:51,020
So we'll do another weigh-in next week.

2199
03:02:51,020 --> 03:02:53,020
But I win anyway.

2200
03:02:53,020 --> 03:02:55,020
I know. Darkstalker, your final thought?

2201
03:02:55,020 --> 03:03:00,700
I hope them over the plague soon, but the final, the really, really major thing is reject

2202
03:03:00,700 --> 03:03:03,060
false icons.

2203
03:03:03,060 --> 03:03:08,180
My final thought is velcro bras, the wave of the future.

2204
03:03:08,180 --> 03:03:10,020
That's it.

2205
03:03:10,020 --> 03:03:14,820
One word, one word to sum it all up, the final word of the show, the nail in the coffin,

2206
03:03:14,820 --> 03:03:17,940
it is Angel's birthday, I will let her have the final word.

2207
03:03:17,940 --> 03:03:18,940
What is it my friend?

2208
03:03:18,940 --> 03:03:19,940
See you next week.

2209
03:03:19,940 --> 03:03:20,940
