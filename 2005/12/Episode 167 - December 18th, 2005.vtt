00:00.000 --> 00:14.440
It was December 24th when Holla Zappin's the dog

00:14.440 --> 00:17.040
When I see the man chillin' with his dog at the park

00:17.040 --> 00:19.440
I had frozen very slowly with my heart full of fear

00:19.440 --> 00:22.240
Looked at his dog on my card, it all rained here

00:22.240 --> 00:24.640
I bet I was illy cool, the man had a beard

00:24.640 --> 00:27.120
Had a bag full of pretty 12 o'clock at night

00:27.120 --> 00:29.680
So I turned my head a second and the man was gone

00:29.680 --> 00:32.180
But he must've dropped his wallet back dead on the lawn

00:32.180 --> 00:34.680
I picked the wallet up and then I took the pause

00:34.680 --> 00:37.180
Took out the lights and then it closed that Santa Claus

00:37.180 --> 00:39.680
A million dollars in it cold, run it to G

00:39.680 --> 00:42.180
Enough to buy a boat, magic claw with E

00:42.180 --> 00:44.680
But I'd never steal the Santa, so that ain't right

00:44.680 --> 00:47.180
So I was goin' home to matter back to him that night

00:47.180 --> 00:49.680
But when I got home I buzzed, cause under the trees

00:49.680 --> 01:07.640
It's Christmas time in Hollis, Queens Mom's cooking chicken in collard greens

01:07.640 --> 01:12.400
Rice and stuff and macaroni and cheese And Santa put gifts under Christmas trees

01:12.400 --> 01:17.400
Decorate the house with lights at night Snow's on the ground, snow white so bright

01:17.400 --> 01:22.400
In the fireplace is the Yule log Beneath the mistletoe, S-E-J eggnog

01:22.400 --> 01:28.400
The rhymes that you hear are the rhymes of Gerald But each and every year we bust Christmas Carols

01:28.400 --> 01:47.800
I'm so loud and proud to hear it's Christmas time and we got this berry

01:47.800 --> 01:52.800
Jack was chillin', the hawk is out And that's what Christmas is all about

01:52.800 --> 01:57.800
The time is now, the place is here And the whole wide world is filled with cheer

01:57.800 --> 02:00.200
My name is MC with the mic in my hand

02:00.200 --> 02:02.900
And I'm chillin' and coolin' just like a snowman

02:02.900 --> 02:05.200
So open your eyes, lend us an ear

02:05.200 --> 02:09.200
We want to say Merry Christmas and Happy New Year!

02:35.200 --> 03:00.200
Down in the workshop, all the elves were making toys

03:00.200 --> 03:04.200
For the good Gentile girls, and the good Gentile boys

03:04.200 --> 03:08.200
When the boss busted in, nearly scared him half to death

03:08.200 --> 03:12.200
Had a rifle in his hands, and cheap whiskey on his breath

03:12.200 --> 03:16.200
From his beard to his boots, he was covered with ammo

03:16.200 --> 03:20.200
Like a big, fat, drunk, disgruntled, yule-tied Rambo

03:20.200 --> 03:24.200
And he smiled as he stared, with a twinkle in his eye

03:24.200 --> 03:28.200
Merry Christmas to all, now you're all gonna die!

03:28.200 --> 03:32.200
The night Santa went crazy

03:32.200 --> 03:36.200
The night St. Nick went insane

03:36.200 --> 03:40.200
Realized he'd been getting the raw meals

03:40.200 --> 03:44.200
So finally Russell laughed in his brain

03:44.200 --> 03:46.200
Well the workshop is gone now

03:46.200 --> 03:48.200
He decided to vomit

03:48.200 --> 03:50.200
Everywhere you'll find pieces

03:50.200 --> 03:52.200
Of cupid and comet

03:52.200 --> 03:54.200
And he tied up his helpers

03:54.200 --> 03:56.200
And he held the elves hostage

03:56.200 --> 04:00.200
And he ground up for Rudolph into reindeer sausage

04:00.200 --> 04:04.200
He got a Dancer and Brandler with an old German Luger

04:04.200 --> 04:08.200
And he slapped a Stasher just like Freddy Krueger

04:08.200 --> 04:12.200
And he picked up a flame thrower and he bought a few kisses

04:12.200 --> 04:16.200
And he took a big bite and played a tape just like chicken

04:16.200 --> 04:20.200
The night Santa went crazy

04:20.200 --> 04:24.200
The night Chris creamed the windows

04:24.200 --> 04:28.700
Now you can't hardly walk around the North Pole

04:28.700 --> 04:32.700
Without stepping in reindeer's blood

04:32.700 --> 04:39.200
There's a National Guard and the FBI

04:39.200 --> 04:42.700
There's a van from the eye with the zoo

04:42.700 --> 04:47.200
And hug out the third man round in the sky

04:47.200 --> 04:51.700
And the bullets fly and the body comes rising

04:51.700 --> 04:57.700
And everyone's dyin' to know, oh Santa, why?

04:57.700 --> 05:00.700
My, my, my, my, my, my

05:00.700 --> 05:04.700
You used to be such a Charlie Guy

05:11.700 --> 05:15.700
Yes, Virginia, now Santa's doin' time

05:15.700 --> 05:19.700
In a federal prison for his infamous crime

05:19.700 --> 05:23.700
Hey little friend, now, don't you cry no more tears

05:23.700 --> 05:27.700
He'll be out with good behavior in seven hundred more years

05:27.700 --> 05:31.700
But now, Mason's in therapy, and Donner's still nervous

05:31.700 --> 05:35.700
And the elves all got jobs, working for the postal service

05:35.700 --> 05:39.700
And the famous surprise, he's on the phone every night

05:39.700 --> 05:42.700
With a lawyer to negotiate the movie rights

05:42.700 --> 05:47.700
They talk about the night fan away craving

05:47.700 --> 05:51.700
The night pain Nicholas slipped

05:51.700 --> 05:55.700
Broke his back for some milk and coffee

05:55.700 --> 05:59.700
Felt to me like he was tired of getting sick

05:59.700 --> 06:03.700
The night Santa went crazy

06:03.700 --> 06:07.700
The night pain Nick went insane

06:07.700 --> 06:11.700
Realized he's just getting the raw deal

06:11.700 --> 06:15.700
Some finally must have snapped in his brain

06:15.700 --> 06:18.700
Some fine man wants to snap in his brain

06:18.700 --> 06:23.700
Tell ya, some fine man wants to snap

06:23.700 --> 06:25.700
In his brain

06:25.700 --> 06:54.700
The following live program is a special presentation of Orange Lounge Radio.

06:54.700 --> 07:11.100

07:21.660 --> 07:25.820
that we might actually get canceled mid-show tonight.

07:25.820 --> 07:26.940
It may happen, they might,

07:26.940 --> 07:31.300
Lion365 might finally pull the plug on us mid-show tonight.

07:31.300 --> 07:33.780
And we'll talk about why that would happen

07:33.780 --> 07:36.340
all after this lovely introduction

07:36.340 --> 07:38.740
featuring that same introduction you've heard all year long,

07:38.740 --> 07:40.460
which we desperately need to change.

07:40.460 --> 07:42.060
But you know you love it.

07:42.060 --> 07:44.580
We'll be back with more Orange Lounge right after this.

07:44.580 --> 07:51.580
Orange Lounge Radio is presented in the TMI sound format.

08:14.580 --> 08:36.300
How come we'reÃ©snt that big?

08:36.300 --> 08:42.300
This mommy talks radio like so much porn.

08:44.300 --> 08:45.300
Oh, God!

08:46.300 --> 08:48.300
Heh heh heh heh! Call me daddy!

08:49.300 --> 08:53.300
Orange Lounge may contain adult content.

08:54.300 --> 08:57.300

08:58.300 --> 09:01.300
Orange Lounge may contain a scene of nudity.

09:02.300 --> 09:04.300
Orange Lounge may contain plenty of...

09:04.300 --> 09:07.980
Plenty of m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-cocky.

09:07.980 --> 09:12.860
Just kidding, Orange Lounge Radio will not contain any of that in this episode.

09:12.860 --> 09:14.860
Well, isn't that special?

09:19.100 --> 09:30.220

And now, here are your hosts for Orange Lounge Radio Live, Dark Sakura, Skye, and Loki.

09:39.220 --> 09:41.720
You know, the chat room's saying that we forgot Festivus.

09:41.720 --> 09:44.720
Fuck Festivus! Fuck it, right? And it's stupidly late.

09:44.720 --> 09:51.720
Oh, hi! We are live! And this is episode number 167 for this December the 18th of 2005.

09:51.720 --> 09:55.220
You know, I'm sorry, but it's not a holiday unless they have a greeting card for it.

09:55.220 --> 09:59.220
And I don't remember seeing any happy Festivus cards at the end.

09:59.220 --> 10:02.520
If Hallmark can make a dollar off of it, there's probably a card out there.

10:02.520 --> 10:05.520
Can I do my intro? Uninterrupted, please, thank you.

10:05.520 --> 10:09.720

10:50.400 --> 10:51.400

Everybody that has Animal Crossing can come join.

12:56.060 --> 12:59.180
Every time I play, I open the gates, but no one ever comes in, so.

12:59.180 --> 13:01.400
I have to talk about Animal Crossing when we come back.

13:01.400 --> 13:02.900
We'll talk about all that stuff when we come back.

13:02.900 --> 13:03.900

Are you strong and cruel as you seem?

15:33.500 --> 15:58.180
Can you hear me from above Do you feel the pain of my heart

15:58.180 --> 16:06.180
Do you feel the pain inside of me?

16:06.180 --> 16:10.180
Was it true?

16:10.180 --> 16:17.180
Will you leave me in the air just in time?

16:17.180 --> 16:23.180
No one cares to stop

16:23.180 --> 16:28.180
Can you see me from above?

16:31.180 --> 16:36.180
Do you see my frozen memory?

16:36.180 --> 16:40.180
Set it down

16:40.180 --> 16:44.180
Let it be alone

16:44.180 --> 16:47.180
Silent child

16:47.180 --> 16:52.180
Staring all of us

17:21.680 --> 17:31.680
Let's not face me

18:21.680 --> 18:23.680
Oh

19:21.680 --> 19:31.680
This is the end of the video, thank you for watching and see you in the next one.

20:21.680 --> 20:23.680
This is the end of the video.

20:23.680 --> 20:25.680
Thank you for watching.

20:25.680 --> 20:27.680
Don't forget to like and subscribe.

20:27.680 --> 20:38.680
Plus, she's having fun while at school and is

20:38.680 --> 20:34.680
ripped away from this Brand mole,

20:34.680 --> 20:40.680
On my coldest dream

20:40.680 --> 20:44.680
Full of happiness

20:44.680 --> 20:46.680
Hello

20:46.680 --> 20:50.680
Hello, is this Schmidt?

20:50.680 --> 20:52.680
No it's him

20:52.680 --> 20:55.680
There, and he vascularizes

20:55.680 --> 20:56.540
Hello

20:56.540 --> 20:57.340
Hello

20:57.340 --> 21:01.340
Hello, is this thing on? Testing? Testing one, two?

21:01.340 --> 21:05.340
I'm looking in the index, but I don't see anything for how to run a radio show.

21:05.340 --> 21:09.340
Hello? I don't understand this. Does this thing work?

21:09.340 --> 21:11.340
This thing reads like stereo instructions.

21:11.340 --> 21:14.340
Is this on? What the hell?

21:14.340 --> 21:18.340
Orange Lounge Radio. Broke-down ghetto bimani radio.

21:18.340 --> 21:20.340
What the f***?

21:20.340 --> 21:25.340
And in that commercial, you heard the lovely voice of Dark Soccer there, who's not here yet, but she's on her way.

21:25.340 --> 21:27.260
Now I'm getting a little concerned.

21:27.260 --> 21:28.880
She probably usually would be here by now.

21:28.880 --> 21:30.580
I hope everything's going okay.

21:30.580 --> 21:34.580
I'm sure we'll get the full story as soon as she arrives, but as promised, I'm wrapped

21:34.580 --> 21:35.580
up in a blanket.

21:35.580 --> 21:38.180
I'm celebrating the holidays the best, the only way I know how.

21:38.180 --> 21:41.700
I'm wrapped up in a blanket, and I have a nice bottle of Guinness, actually.

21:41.700 --> 21:45.420
I decided against vodka, I went for the Guinness, so I have a nice bottle of Guinness in one

21:45.420 --> 21:47.620
hand here.

21:47.620 --> 21:52.980
And I'm just thinking about some Yuletide greetings, which I'm sure I'll be rambling

21:52.980 --> 21:53.980
off a little later.

21:53.980 --> 21:54.700
uh...

21:54.700 --> 21:57.420
let me know so i don't know what other

21:57.420 --> 22:00.340
well i want to know we get uh... has just left

22:00.340 --> 22:01.540
uh...

22:01.540 --> 22:05.260
well i think i think i think i think i think i think things are swinging in a

22:05.260 --> 22:06.060
lot of town

22:06.060 --> 22:09.400
you know you may have to add you add more friends code is a friend to codes

22:09.400 --> 22:13.000
and don't forget as if you want to uh... given to a lot of time

22:13.000 --> 22:16.980
head on over to our chat room at w w dot org entry dot com click on chat

22:16.980 --> 22:20.340
and then look you have a message with your friend cody i have a lot of them

22:20.340 --> 22:25.180
already. I mean, I have to look and see who's in here, but I have a lot of people already

22:25.180 --> 22:28.700
added that were posting in, like, forums and stuff.

22:28.700 --> 22:29.700
Oh, good.

22:29.700 --> 22:31.060
So, let's see who we got here.

22:31.060 --> 22:33.300
Nah, I'll just take your word for it. You don't have to name them all out.

22:33.300 --> 22:34.300
Yeah.

22:34.300 --> 22:37.140
If they message you and, you know, want to know if they're on the list, you can tell

22:37.140 --> 22:41.060
them if they're in there or not. Now, are you close to maxing out your list just yet?

22:41.060 --> 22:43.140
Have you maxed out the list there on Animal Crossing?

22:43.140 --> 22:45.940
No. I've only got about seven people.

22:45.940 --> 22:53.940
I have Dan, I have Milti, Black Lab, Jason, Harold, you, and Jamie.

22:53.940 --> 22:59.460
You know, I haven't touched Animal Crossing in probably about five days now, which is

22:59.460 --> 23:02.260
kind of sad because I was all into Animal Crossing.

23:02.260 --> 23:07.220
I was so up and ready to play Animal Crossing, and I was digging all around town trying to

23:07.220 --> 23:14.100
find a copy of Animal Crossing, and I went everywhere I could trying to get a copy of

23:14.100 --> 23:19.180
animal crossing and um trying to get it early and then I finally picked it up I

23:19.180 --> 23:22.900
played it for three days and then never played it again do you know why I didn't

23:22.900 --> 23:26.060
play it again why because I bought a copy of Final Fantasy 4 advanced and

23:26.060 --> 23:30.180
that's all I've been playing everything I've been playing dark soccer is here I

23:30.180 --> 23:33.460
was starting to get a little worried how Mike's over there how you doing my

23:33.460 --> 23:40.420
friend you need to be on mother nature can bite my abundant ass what your

23:40.420 --> 23:43.140
abundant ass. What happened here? You want to sit, honey?

23:43.140 --> 23:50.420
Okay, alright. Alright, anyway. We'll talk about our weekend day is usually how we start

23:50.420 --> 23:54.680
off the show. Since Dark Soccer is getting situated, we'll go over to Loki and see. Loki,

23:54.680 --> 23:56.820
how was your week? How was your day?

23:56.820 --> 24:04.140
My weekend day, pretty uneventful. Just still been fighting the cold. This week we actually

24:04.140 --> 24:09.660
found out though that we're going to get a lot of time off. They're giving us the Friday

24:09.660 --> 24:15.300
and Monday, um, you know, around Christmas and New Year's. So actually, this next week

24:15.300 --> 24:21.260
I work four days and the week after I work three days. So that rocks. Must be nice. Must

24:21.260 --> 24:28.980
be nice. And a $250 gift card for cash. Um, other than that, I've just been playing a

24:28.980 --> 24:34.580
lot of Animal Crossing, actually. Not too much in the 360 stuff, just because I hate

24:34.580 --> 24:38.780
having to set it up and take it back down because I take it to work. But at work we've

24:38.780 --> 24:42.740
We've been playing four-player deathmatches in Call of Duty 2, as well as Grand Theft

24:42.740 --> 24:45.180
Auto, or Liberty City Stories.

24:45.180 --> 24:46.820
So it's been a nice mix of stuff.

24:46.820 --> 24:50.380
We got another person in on Liberty City Stories now for five.

24:50.380 --> 24:51.780
So it's really cool.

24:51.780 --> 24:56.300
And Animal Crossing, Nellie's been taking it to work and playing it.

24:56.300 --> 24:58.600
So I've been playing it as well.

24:58.600 --> 24:59.600
So it's kind of cool.

24:59.600 --> 25:03.140
Can you do Friendly Fire on Call of Duty 2?

25:03.140 --> 25:05.560
Well, we play Deathmatch.

25:05.560 --> 25:08.300
So I suppose you could.

25:08.300 --> 25:11.880
In the single player mode though, because I was watching Xtopher play a demo on one

25:11.880 --> 25:16.480
of those Xbox 360 kiosks at like Circuit City or whatever, and I kept telling him, shoot

25:16.480 --> 25:19.240
that guy in the back of the head, shoot your friend in the back of the head, I want to

25:19.240 --> 25:20.240
see blood, I want to see blood.

25:20.240 --> 25:23.520
And like he said he was trying to do it, but it wouldn't work, but he might have just not

25:23.520 --> 25:24.520
been doing it right.

25:24.520 --> 25:27.600
Sure, but I know that it's really fun, and I like the way that they do the maps where

25:27.600 --> 25:32.760
they don't show where each player is, but when you fire your gun, a little blip goes

25:32.760 --> 25:37.800
on your screen showing you which direction the sound came in, and that's really cool.

25:37.800 --> 25:46.800
Um, but other than that, um, no, I've been trying to, I'm actually going to try to play some more games, you know, while, you know,

25:46.800 --> 25:49.800
Let's see here.

25:49.800 --> 25:54.800
Um, some more games while I'm, um, you know, on my breaks here.

25:54.800 --> 25:57.800
But, um, yeah, it's been pretty cool. Just a lot of gaming.

25:57.800 --> 26:03.800
And, um, starting to get some of my gift stuff, you know, and, you know, I'm dead shopping finally.

26:03.800 --> 26:08.800
How many days away till Christmas are we at now? Seven? Seven days till Christmas?

26:08.800 --> 26:13.800
And I haven't started my shopping yet. I'd just like to point that out. I've not started my Christmas shopping yet.

26:13.800 --> 26:18.800
I've got stuff related to topics we'll be talking about later.

26:18.800 --> 26:23.800
I have to laugh about certain things. We'll get to it later. It's just good.

26:23.800 --> 26:28.800
If we get to it later. Now here's the thing. I was talking about in the beginning of the show

26:28.800 --> 26:36.360
365 may well cancel us mid-show tonight. What's actually going on is that live 365

26:36.360 --> 26:41.040
is doing rotating outages and they've been doing them all weekend and we think

26:41.040 --> 26:46.800
we've missed it for tonight but we're not sure. So if kids at 8 o'clock the

26:46.800 --> 26:50.940
station goes down, we ain't coming back tonight because live 365 is doing

26:50.940 --> 26:53.220
rotating outages. I don't know what the hell they're doing. They're moving their

26:53.220 --> 26:57.760
servers to a new thing, a bigger, better, stronger, faster, harder server. I don't

26:57.760 --> 26:58.760
what it is.

26:58.760 --> 26:59.760
We need to move them to Sweden.

26:59.760 --> 27:03.500
So whatever they're doing, they're moving their servers, and if we happen to be on one

27:03.500 --> 27:07.240
of the lucky servers that's getting moved tonight, we will be off the air at eight o'clock.

27:07.240 --> 27:10.540
So if the show goes down at eight o'clock, we ain't coming back.

27:10.540 --> 27:11.540
So sorry.

27:11.540 --> 27:16.480
But hey, life sucks sometimes, and Christmas sucks when you've been bad.

27:16.480 --> 27:21.480
So anyway.

27:21.480 --> 27:22.480
Where are we at show-wise?

27:22.480 --> 27:23.480
I'm sorry.

27:23.480 --> 27:24.480
I've lost my train of thought.

27:24.480 --> 27:25.480
We're doing my week with a mouthful of burrito.

27:25.480 --> 27:26.480
Oh, okay.

27:26.480 --> 27:27.480
How was your week?

27:27.480 --> 27:31.480
her weekend day is going to get a lot better

27:31.480 --> 27:35.480
I've been trying to get this forever, this was going to be a wedding gift

27:35.480 --> 27:39.480
now it's actually a Christmas present

27:39.480 --> 27:43.480
I got the last one, the actual display model

27:43.480 --> 27:47.480
I have purple lacrosse, that means Dan doesn't get to play the PSP anymore

27:47.480 --> 27:51.480
did that actually come out?

27:51.480 --> 27:55.480
yes

27:55.480 --> 27:59.480
By the way, good Christmas etiquette, leaving the price tag on there. That's smooth move.

27:59.480 --> 28:02.480
It's a display model, what can I say? That's why it's open, too.

28:02.480 --> 28:05.480
Oh, it looks cute! I thought this was going to be a darker game.

28:05.480 --> 28:07.480
No! It's a cutie game.

28:07.480 --> 28:09.480
Oh, it's cute. Oh, shit!

28:09.480 --> 28:10.480
Shouldn't they try this?

28:10.480 --> 28:12.480
I already broke the fucking thing!

28:12.480 --> 28:14.480
I am happy I have a ball of gold.

28:14.480 --> 28:15.480
Good job!

28:15.480 --> 28:16.480
Thank you.

28:16.480 --> 28:17.480
Happy happy.

28:17.480 --> 28:21.480
That's awesome. I'm going to have your present at the end of the week because I didn't go shopping last week as I had finals.

28:21.480 --> 28:22.480
Ah, that's alright.

28:22.480 --> 28:23.480
Oh, and this would be your week and your day.

28:23.480 --> 28:29.040
Yes, finals kicked my ass, however, I got feedback on my second to last Illustrator

28:29.040 --> 28:33.280
project and I made a 95 on it, because I'm awesome.

28:33.280 --> 28:37.280
You said that my Silent Hill cover looked really nice.

28:37.280 --> 28:38.800
I haven't got my grade on it yet.

28:38.800 --> 28:43.600
I got full points from my Dreamweaver project and I haven't got the results back of my World

28:43.600 --> 28:44.600
Geography final.

28:44.600 --> 28:47.920
Did you link the Silent Hill thingy bobber in chat?

28:47.920 --> 28:48.920
Because it was actually really good.

28:48.920 --> 28:52.720
Like, it's something that I could see actually being used, like, on a Playstation type cover.

28:52.720 --> 28:57.980
I linked it in my live journal, but I'll link it in the chat room when I'm done with my

28:57.980 --> 28:58.980
thing.

28:58.980 --> 29:01.900
There's not everybody in chat that stalks you, LJ-wise, so you should probably link

29:01.900 --> 29:02.900
that.

29:02.900 --> 29:08.540
Well, I also am friends only, because I care who reads my journal.

29:08.540 --> 29:14.320
Well, yeah, I'm friends only for the fact that I don't want, just because of my nature

29:14.320 --> 29:19.820
of my day job, I don't want folks finding me unless I'm okay with it.

29:19.820 --> 29:26.100
I had to fight the rain tonight because it was just really nasty.

29:26.100 --> 29:29.780
I was sick before I left home, really icky.

29:29.780 --> 29:34.300
And then I had to pass an accident, and then I had to go to Starbucks and get a latte.

29:34.300 --> 29:35.980
I picked up brownie bites for everybody.

29:35.980 --> 29:39.420
Oh yeah, I wanted a brownie bite, but I had to pass because I was in mid-sentence earlier.

29:39.420 --> 29:40.420
Oh, right on.

29:40.420 --> 29:41.420
And, um, no?

29:41.420 --> 29:44.420
I don't think they have nuts.

29:44.420 --> 29:45.420
I didn't know what they were.

29:45.420 --> 29:50.700
Well, I will have to eat one and see if they have nuts in them.

29:50.700 --> 29:52.700
These are nut-free, my friend.

29:52.700 --> 29:54.780
They are the nutless wonder.

29:54.780 --> 29:58.500
Just like, never mind.

29:58.500 --> 30:00.500
A fitting meal.

30:00.500 --> 30:11.540
But I also got DJ KK last night, which is the KK Eurobeat song, while I was watching

30:11.540 --> 30:12.540
Stargate.

30:12.540 --> 30:16.940
Now, actually, Loki has OLR town open tonight for our listeners to join in.

30:16.940 --> 30:20.540
Okay, you have the little brat lost in your town, and I have the mama in my town.

30:20.540 --> 30:23.340
Yes, I've been trying to get...yeah.

30:23.340 --> 30:27.140
Okay, so we'll have to fix that at some point tonight. Reunite baby and mama.

30:27.140 --> 30:30.240
I have to find the baby, because baby appears every now and then.

30:30.240 --> 30:34.340
Okay, well I know where mama is, so I'll go to your town and rescue the baby.

30:34.340 --> 30:38.740
Mmm, I think Dark Sakura put something trippy in these brownies,

30:38.740 --> 30:40.340
because I'm feeling all warm and fuzzy.

30:40.340 --> 30:42.340
That would be the stuff at Starbucks.

30:42.340 --> 30:44.340
No, no, wait. That's the Guinness.

30:44.340 --> 30:47.340
Yeah, I can't have that as I'm going to be driving tonight.

30:47.340 --> 30:51.340
And I may have jury duty tomorrow, which I hope I do so that I don't have to go to work.

30:51.340 --> 30:54.340
Merry Christmas, you get jury duty. How did that happen?

30:54.340 --> 30:57.340
Well, because I missed it the last time, and I called back to reschedule, and I said,

30:57.340 --> 31:01.340
Yeah, but I'm in school. They're like, Okay, well, we'll just schedule you for the week after your finals.

31:01.340 --> 31:04.340
And I hope I have it, because I don't want to go to work.

31:04.340 --> 31:06.340
Does your work pay you when you get jury duty?

31:06.340 --> 31:06.340
Yes.

31:06.340 --> 31:07.340
Isn't that the best?

31:07.340 --> 31:09.340
I work for a bank!

31:09.340 --> 31:11.340
Hallelujah!

31:11.340 --> 31:16.340
My work pays for it, too, and I've been praying to get jury duty, just to see what would happen.

31:16.340 --> 31:20.340
I just want to go hang out in there and wait for them to pick me up, so I'll play Animal Crossing.

31:20.340 --> 31:26.340
And then, um, when I get picked, I want to sit on, like, a really nasty case.

31:26.340 --> 31:27.340
Because I'd love...

31:27.340 --> 31:29.340
Like murder? Like double murder?

31:29.340 --> 31:33.340
Not a double murder, but I'd like to get on, like, a suicide case.

31:33.340 --> 31:36.340
Wait, how do suicide cases go to trial?

31:36.340 --> 31:39.340
Because they have to prove it's a suicide for some.

31:39.340 --> 31:40.340
Oh. But with a jury trial?

31:40.340 --> 31:41.340
jury trial?

31:41.340 --> 31:42.340
Yeah.

31:42.340 --> 31:44.340
Did you mean to kill yourself, corpse?

31:44.340 --> 31:45.340
Well, no.

31:45.340 --> 31:46.340
Poke it with a stick.

31:46.340 --> 31:48.800
There's those ones where they need to prove if it's suicide or murder.

31:48.800 --> 31:56.900
I like those kind, but I don't like just the straight-up, uh, hack you, arr, arr, die.

31:56.900 --> 32:00.620
I want to get in on a case because I, you know, I should have been a lawyer except I'm

32:00.620 --> 32:06.540
too, you know, lazy, but I wanted, I love studying the whole process.

32:06.540 --> 32:07.540
I like seeing it in action.

32:07.540 --> 32:08.540
I love watching court TV.

32:08.540 --> 32:10.780
are you going to get out there and if they ask you

32:10.780 --> 32:14.460
uh... now dark soccer of course that's not what they'd say they'd say jamie

32:14.460 --> 32:20.500
are you a supporter of the death penalty and you're going to get up there and say I AM THE DEATH PENALTY

32:20.500 --> 32:26.100
GUNS DON'T KILL PEOPLE! I DO!

32:26.100 --> 32:30.180
I support the NRA. Well you know the death penalty in the state we live in in California

32:30.180 --> 32:32.260
huge issue right now because the Tukey

32:32.260 --> 32:37.420
they did the thing to Tukey and now everybody's all

32:37.420 --> 32:41.980
all death penalty death penalty rah rah rah so inevitably if it is a murder case

32:41.980 --> 32:49.820
I have the solution. That's funny. Inmate battle royale. Took all the fuckers on an island. That was a movie.

32:49.820 --> 32:54.220
We played Leona. What was it no escape? And he gets off the island at the end if I

32:54.220 --> 32:57.100
remember sorry if this is a spoiler if I remember right he gets off to the island

32:57.100 --> 33:01.460
at the end. I think. I don't know if I want I don't know if I want Tukey living

33:01.460 --> 33:08.580
next door. I think that it would solve a problem. And then the inmate where they don't get their

33:08.580 --> 33:13.220
freedom that they get a much nicer jail cell. And then they have to defend their title the

33:13.220 --> 33:18.580
next year. You're evil. Someone snuck into my town and dropped fruit at my feet. Oh,

33:18.580 --> 33:27.740
that's nice. Yes. No, I'm not. I'm thinking about overpopulation in the jail cells and

33:27.740 --> 33:34.460
cutting down cost. I'm a penny saver. I'm frugal. You know, they should vote for me

33:34.460 --> 33:39.340
because, you know, I would kill more people and save you more money.

33:39.340 --> 33:43.640
You know, I just saw a meme on LiveJournal, which is the order of the presidency or something

33:43.640 --> 33:48.540
like that, where you can add your name to the list to be in line to be president. I'll

33:48.540 --> 33:51.500
have to give you a link so you can add your name. I think they're on something like 5100.

33:51.500 --> 33:56.340
So if you could kill the other 5100 people, which isn't very many when you consider the

33:56.340 --> 34:00.300
population of the U.S., you, Ms. Dark Soccer, could be president of the U.S.

34:00.300 --> 34:03.100
That's because I'm not 40.

34:03.100 --> 34:05.740
Apparently they've thrown that out the door in this thing.

34:05.740 --> 34:07.740
It's 35, but yes.

34:07.740 --> 34:08.740
35, yes.

34:08.740 --> 34:10.420
That's a few years off.

34:10.420 --> 34:14.020
Oh, oh, oh, oh, I did learn another thing.

34:14.020 --> 34:19.020
Because my friend was DJing at Rapture on Friday, I ended up going out to the club,

34:19.020 --> 34:22.540
which I probably shouldn't have done in hindsight because I was shaking by the time we got back

34:22.540 --> 34:23.540
in my car.

34:23.540 --> 34:25.340
I was so sick.

34:25.340 --> 34:34.780
But I ended up, he played some excellent stuff, like all the old classics, he was playing

34:34.780 --> 34:39.260
The Cure, he was playing Depeche, but he played Kiss at like a golf club.

34:39.260 --> 34:42.180
Not Kiss, why am I saying that?

34:42.180 --> 34:45.180
I meant The Purple One.

34:45.180 --> 34:46.180
Prince?

34:46.180 --> 34:49.180
Because I was singing Kiss, but he played another song.

34:49.180 --> 34:50.180
Purple Way?

34:50.180 --> 34:53.700
Or did he play When Doves Cry, because I think that's my favorite Prince song.

34:53.700 --> 34:56.860
no he played something else. Or Kiss. I like Kiss too.

34:56.860 --> 35:00.460
But don't have to be beautiful.

35:00.460 --> 35:07.020
Anyway, and the rest of my week has been

35:07.020 --> 35:10.660
recovering from the plague.

35:10.660 --> 35:14.620
And you are on the other side of the plague now? Hopefully, but

35:14.620 --> 35:18.620
I don't know. I actually took my double dose of Vicodin last night

35:18.620 --> 35:22.220
so that I would sleep through the night and I couldn't get to sleep

35:22.220 --> 35:26.540
with like two shots of my Vicodin syrup in me so I stayed up and finally I'm just like

35:26.540 --> 35:30.540
shit it's been three hours that I took it so I took another dose and then went and laid down

35:30.540 --> 35:39.500
at 4 30 and woke up at three so yeah I slept most of the day. Let's see my week and my day my week

35:39.500 --> 35:44.540
has been very very busy I've just been kind of going out and doing a lot of things I went to

35:44.540 --> 35:51.180
the movies I went with Xtifer and and some friends to go see Sarah Silverman Jesus is Magic which is

35:51.180 --> 35:54.780
playing at our local art house movie and of course Sarah Silverman's the, you know,

35:54.780 --> 35:59.840
comic that likes to say fuck a lot. It was pretty funny. I'll let X differ talk

35:59.840 --> 36:05.580
about it more a little later in the show. And went out to eat a lot because I

36:05.580 --> 36:08.860
don't like cooking so I like to go out and eat things. Of course, as I was saying

36:08.860 --> 36:12.160
a little bit earlier in the program, I have not been playing a lot of Animal

36:12.160 --> 36:15.580
Crossing because it got kicked aside for Final Fantasy IV Advance, which I

36:15.580 --> 36:20.700
picked up earlier in the week, and have not put down everything that I remember

36:20.700 --> 36:25.260
about that game from 14 years ago when I first played it is coming back to me and

36:25.260 --> 36:28.620
it's just that's all I care about right now so my village is gonna be filled

36:28.620 --> 36:31.580
with weeds because it's gonna have to wait until I beat Final Fantasy 4

36:31.580 --> 36:37.320
Advance and I'm making pretty good progress I'd say I'm about I don't know

36:37.320 --> 36:40.220
how far I'm into the game about five hours and how long was I game about 30

36:40.220 --> 36:44.180
hours I'm about five hours into the game so as soon as I beat Final Fantasy 4

36:44.180 --> 36:47.420
Advance I'll be back into Animal Crossing again and then I'll join you

36:47.420 --> 36:52.420
guys know how our town. Your town's gonna be full of weed. I know it's gonna be hella

36:52.420 --> 36:56.620
full of weeds. Make sure you buy insurance. I have insurance, thankfully. I bought

36:56.620 --> 37:00.380
insurance from the dude when he came. But I have yet to have a single KK song.

37:00.380 --> 37:08.340
I've only paid off one loan on my house, so nothing there. Um, as far as the rest of my

37:08.340 --> 37:12.180
week goes, really not a whole lot noteworthy. Just um, I was gonna go to San

37:12.180 --> 37:15.500
Francisco yesterday, but the weather here has been kind of crappy here in

37:15.500 --> 37:19.320
California when starts when it starts raining in California people like

37:19.320 --> 37:23.180
forget how to drive and they're not sure what to do especially when it starts

37:23.180 --> 37:26.840
raining hard and they start doing the flood watches like people go crazy like

37:26.840 --> 37:30.720
that's what's happening today and so crazy in fact that we you know we might

37:30.720 --> 37:36.080
get we might we might go down mid show tonight because the hysteria you if the

37:36.080 --> 37:40.160
show disappears at eight o'clock you know that there was rioting going on in

37:40.160 --> 37:45.560
the state capitol. So that's pretty much it for my week and my day. Not a whole

37:45.560 --> 37:52.080
lot else special. Anyway, so now, Loki, I want to talk about this before you go to

37:52.080 --> 37:55.160
a break and come back and start doing a little bit of, you know, bimani news. I

37:55.160 --> 37:59.400
want to talk about what happened with Xbox 360. What exactly happened that

37:59.400 --> 38:02.280
you were kind of laughing about before the show started tonight? Basically, it was like

38:02.280 --> 38:07.520
launch number two. The numbers for Best Buy leaked out to what they were gonna

38:07.520 --> 38:12.160
yet, and they were doing a Sunday sale that was advertised, and basically they were going

38:12.160 --> 38:16.960
to have like the same allocations as they had when the thing launched.

38:16.960 --> 38:21.240
So people were camping out, and basically the source were said, do not pre-sell any

38:21.240 --> 38:27.680
of these, these are to be sold, do not open early, you know, these are for the advertisement.

38:27.680 --> 38:33.000
Well, no, the Best Buy of course, they didn't listen to that, they pre-sold them some of

38:33.000 --> 38:37.160
the nights before, and people camped out in the rain again for them, and a lot of people

38:37.160 --> 38:41.000
were disappointed because, oh, guess what, they sold them the night before and you waited

38:41.000 --> 38:46.440
for nothing. But here, here's a nice compact laptop computer for cheap. You want this instead?

38:46.440 --> 38:50.680
You know, it's like, so basically a nice bait and switch for a lot of the stores.

38:50.680 --> 38:55.600
So, so I, now I heard that they just plain didn't get them because we were at a Best

38:55.600 --> 38:58.760
Buy here locally and I overheard a conversation about, yeah, all these people were camping

38:58.760 --> 39:03.280
out last night and, and I was like, oh, ha ha, they didn't get there. That's the moment

39:03.280 --> 39:07.080
and I knew, oh haha, those Xbox 360s didn't show up. Some kid on the internet played a

39:07.080 --> 39:11.980
practical joke on everybody, you know. But, so they really did get more 360s, but they

39:11.980 --> 39:12.980
just did pre-sold them?

39:12.980 --> 39:16.120
They did, they did, they got a shipment in on Friday and they were supposed to hold them

39:16.120 --> 39:21.880
until the 18th. Now the thing that was also funny though, and because this sold out so

39:21.880 --> 39:27.020
quick, and they did get them. There was rumors that they did get them and people waiting

39:27.020 --> 39:31.560
in line and stuff, but this whole thing that they had pre-sold them, either the night before

39:31.560 --> 39:35.700
or just, you know, bad situation all over again.

39:35.700 --> 39:39.260
However, if you didn't get them on this day,

39:39.260 --> 39:42.960
never fear, they're getting another shipment on the 22nd.

39:42.960 --> 39:45.400
Oh, enough talk. Just before Christmas.

39:45.400 --> 39:48.800
Yes. You hope. Now, is this coming from the same source?

39:48.800 --> 39:53.280
This is from the same source. And the source for this Best Buy stuff was an inside source.

39:53.280 --> 39:54.160
And he's been

39:54.160 --> 39:57.220
the one that's like providing, I think he's the guy that provides Kotaku with all their

39:57.220 --> 40:03.560
information of Best Buy stuff. It's all inside stuff. So pretty much, yeah, the next shipment's

40:03.560 --> 40:07.980
20 seconds, supposedly. I said some stores are getting them, but I noticed a lot of other

40:07.980 --> 40:11.420
stores, GameStop, are not getting their shipments in on time.

40:11.420 --> 40:15.140
Just in time for Christmas, the third shipment to Best Buy.

40:15.140 --> 40:17.420
I know it's not their fault, but it's just because, you know.

40:17.420 --> 40:20.100
And Microsoft's playing favorites. Yeah, they're playing favorites with Best

40:20.100 --> 40:23.620
Buy, so. Must be nice.

40:23.620 --> 40:27.140
Must be nice to be sucking the cock of Microsoft.

40:27.140 --> 40:28.140
All I got to say...

40:28.140 --> 40:32.940
Did you know Bill Gates and Melinda Gates, and Bono from YouTube, Persons of the Year

40:32.940 --> 40:33.940
for Time Magazine.

40:33.940 --> 40:34.940
Nice.

40:34.940 --> 40:35.940
Bill Gates.

40:35.940 --> 40:40.100
Big fat mug right there on the cover of Time Magazine, and nothing against Bill Gates.

40:40.100 --> 40:44.780
I know he didn't single handedly put out this Xbox 360 and cause a disaster, but he sure

40:44.780 --> 40:46.340
makes a good target.

40:46.340 --> 40:47.340
Yeah.

40:47.340 --> 40:51.140
Yeah, but he is living proof that geeks can succeed.

40:51.140 --> 40:56.140
And let me put it this way though, they really fucked up the whole launch of this system.

40:56.140 --> 40:59.140
I mean, it's all messed up.

40:59.140 --> 41:03.140
Well, what would you say to people, though, that say every launch is fucked up?

41:03.140 --> 41:07.140
There are some pretty fucked up launches out there, but I say the way they've been treating

41:07.140 --> 41:11.140
this one, it's been kind of, it's been really bad.

41:11.140 --> 41:12.140
Really bad.

41:12.140 --> 41:13.140
I mean...

41:13.140 --> 41:15.140
At least the 360s work, right?

41:15.140 --> 41:16.140
They do.

41:16.140 --> 41:17.140
They do work.

41:17.140 --> 41:21.140
So, I mean, the whole thing of, you know, they're all defective and stuff.

41:21.140 --> 41:24.140
Mine's, I've had mine crash once, and it wasn't heat-related.

41:24.140 --> 41:28.140
It's just a glitch in the game because of the crash.

41:28.140 --> 41:30.140
Because games were rushed?

41:30.140 --> 41:35.140
No, not necessarily. Games will crash every now and then when you try to do weird things with them.

41:35.140 --> 41:39.140
It just crashed for whatever reason.

41:39.140 --> 41:43.140
I haven't had it crash since then, and I've been satisfied with mine.

41:43.140 --> 41:48.140
It looks good on normal TVs and stuff, and don't really need a high-def TV.

41:48.140 --> 41:51.140
I mean, you can. I mean, definitely you'll get the best picture out of it,

41:51.140 --> 41:55.900
it's not going to suffer from having a, you know, a normal TV, playing even four-player

41:55.900 --> 41:58.340
death matches and stuff.

41:58.340 --> 42:01.460
Because it is higher-res, it's really nice.

42:01.460 --> 42:04.900
When the screen split four ways, you can still see very well.

42:04.900 --> 42:07.880
It's not like, you know, feeling all squashed and stuff.

42:07.880 --> 42:13.380
So I definitely, you know, think it's good that they're doing it, but I don't know.

42:13.380 --> 42:15.740
The way they did this whole launch is really fucked up.

42:15.740 --> 42:20.540
And hopefully, you know, Sony will learn what the PlayStation 3, you know, they won't mess

42:20.540 --> 42:25.260
that one up, but the way it looks right now, who knows when that thing's even going to

42:25.260 --> 42:29.500
launch, so. And that's going to be probably even more rushed to the market, if anything,

42:29.500 --> 42:30.820
so. It'll be interesting.

42:30.820 --> 42:37.540
Well, kids, we are going to take a quick break. Since we already did our winter-themed break

42:37.540 --> 42:41.660
there at the start of the show, we're going to just do some random stuff here. And when

42:41.660 --> 42:46.060
we come back from this break, we'll get a check on what's going on in OLR town. I believe

42:46.060 --> 42:51.700
that uh... dark soccer is on her way to reunite reunite mom and baby

42:51.700 --> 42:57.660
you're selling the baby? what are you doing?

42:57.660 --> 43:02.820
tom nook has offered six hundred bells for the baby so we will see what happens

43:02.820 --> 43:06.340
because tom nook would buy anything no no no it's crazy red

43:06.340 --> 43:10.380
because remember we sell children on the black market no that's right

43:10.380 --> 43:11.460
crazy man

43:11.460 --> 43:14.580
alright so we'll be back we're going to get a check on what's going on in noel art town

43:14.580 --> 43:18.940
We'll talk about some stuff going on in the music game world and plenty more when we come

44:44.580 --> 45:06.580
If you can't say goodbye, baby tell me why

45:06.580 --> 45:28.860
You say that love is not a possession You say that love leads back to sea

45:28.860 --> 45:36.500
You say we must give this devotion But you don't say that you love me

45:36.500 --> 45:39.500
Sometimes I wonder what I'm doing

45:39.500 --> 45:43.500
Sometimes I'm cold and serious

45:43.500 --> 45:47.500
But when you touch my body and close your eyes

45:47.500 --> 45:50.500
My little baby, I don't realize

45:50.500 --> 45:54.500
If you can say goodbye, baby, tell me why

45:54.500 --> 45:57.500
You don't wanna love me just like I do

45:57.500 --> 46:04.500
If you can say goodbye, tell me what I've got to do

46:04.500 --> 46:09.500
If you can say goodbye, baby tell me why

46:09.500 --> 46:12.500
You don't wanna love me, just like I do

46:12.500 --> 46:14.500
You can't say goodbye

46:14.500 --> 46:17.500
Tell me what I've got to do

46:44.500 --> 47:02.500
In the far real you gotta learn how to survive

47:02.500 --> 47:07.500
Cause you never know when it's your turn to take a dive

47:07.500 --> 47:13.500
So you go through each day with your eyes in the back of your head

47:13.500 --> 47:19.200
You'll never know, maybe you will be alive or beaten

47:20.700 --> 47:23.200
That is why, always have it

47:23.200 --> 47:25.800
You'll tell your midnight special

47:25.800 --> 47:28.500
Never leave, but without it

47:28.500 --> 47:31.000
Always better when the midnight special

47:31.000 --> 47:33.500
In the dark, always free

47:33.500 --> 47:36.200
Never know, who you're gonna be

47:36.200 --> 47:41.800
You're my friend, you got me next to you

48:36.200 --> 48:43.200
Hey! Hey! Hey!

48:43.200 --> 48:50.200
It is a call I call, and you're my all-out. I'll take you to the, call I call.

48:50.200 --> 48:56.200
It is a call I call, you better shake your bones, and come on down the, call I call.

49:26.200 --> 49:28.920
so uncensored

49:28.920 --> 49:31.420
that even Tom Brokaw could get a job with us.

49:31.420 --> 49:32.720
Uh, Mooch, uh,

49:32.720 --> 49:35.600
Moo-Kaw-Kee. Orange Lounge Radio.

49:35.600 --> 49:37.020
Tag, son.

49:37.020 --> 49:41.120
Welcome back, boys and girls, to Orange Lounge.

49:41.120 --> 49:43.880
In that break, you heard the Twilight Zone

49:43.880 --> 49:45.600
Midnight Special.

49:45.600 --> 49:47.520
If you can say goodbye.

49:47.520 --> 49:51.000
And the Rizlim remix, which people, for no good reason, were chatting about in our

49:51.000 --> 49:51.800
chat room.

49:51.800 --> 49:55.560
So I thought I'd throw that in there. Yeah, the Rizlim remix kind of sucks. I don't know why people are

49:55.560 --> 49:58.960
talking about it but they were the original rhythm is so so much better I

49:58.960 --> 50:07.840
mean it's not that the rhythm remixes is awful but it is anyway of course you can

50:07.840 --> 50:11.320
join our chat room and get in on the fun www.orangeonstrader.com click on chat

50:11.320 --> 50:17.840
anything new going on in our town no nobody you know what everybody fucking

50:17.840 --> 50:23.040
wanted to say or was saying to us oh you got to do the Animal Crossing thing and

50:23.040 --> 50:27.200
open up your town a while visit. Here we are, Ghost Town. I think Tumbleweed is rolling

50:27.200 --> 50:32.240
by in OLR Town as we speak. However, Wonder Dog Harold did leave me quite a bit of fruit

50:32.240 --> 50:37.460
at my feet. Well that's good. Food is good. Lots of peaches and pears, so I'm very thankful

50:37.460 --> 50:45.720
for that. Good deal. But yeah, I've got like, a few people added, but no one's visiting.

50:45.720 --> 50:53.020
Well, we'll just see if this segment continues after this week. Bastard people. Have we read

51:23.020 --> 51:27.020
I guess Skype 2.0 adds webcam to it, or something?

51:27.020 --> 51:30.020
Of course, we threw away our webcam because it sucked.

51:30.020 --> 51:36.020
Hopefully we'll have a new one eventually, but for now we're not going to have that on Skype.

51:36.020 --> 51:40.020
But the new one still works with this old one that we have, right?

51:40.020 --> 51:43.020
We'll see. Hopefully it does, or else we're screwed.

51:43.020 --> 51:44.020
We're not going to be able to do Skypline.

51:44.020 --> 51:46.020
I remember last time we couldn't do Skypline, oh boy.

51:46.020 --> 51:48.020
That was bad.

51:48.020 --> 51:50.020
All right, so we are going to open up Skypline a little bit,

51:50.020 --> 51:54.540
But I do want to talk a little bit about some of the money news, some things going on out

51:54.540 --> 51:57.340
there in the world of the DDR.

51:57.340 --> 52:01.820
First things first, there is going to be a soundtrack coming out for DDR Festival and

52:01.820 --> 52:02.820
DDR Strike.

52:02.820 --> 52:06.580
It's kind of like a combined soundtrack, V-ware, I don't really know what the hell they're

52:06.580 --> 52:07.580
calling it.

52:07.580 --> 52:11.380
But it's going to have a lot of the tracks from Festival and Strike that weren't really

52:11.380 --> 52:14.140
in any other DDR game that came out in Japan.

52:14.140 --> 52:19.220
So you get some things that we got here in the US, such as Kids in America, Believe in

52:19.220 --> 52:26.020
bizarre love triangle. Then you get some things that only came out in other countries. Superstar.

52:26.020 --> 52:30.260
I guess just Superstar until you get into, of course, the DDR Strike music and a lot

52:30.260 --> 52:35.420
of the new stuff that's going to be there. Heaven is a Place on Earth, Let's Dance, You

52:35.420 --> 52:39.300
Sexy Thing, and some of the other stuff there. So I think it's kind of interesting. I don't

52:39.300 --> 52:42.700
think this song list is complete, though. I have a feeling there's going to be more

52:42.700 --> 52:49.060
to it. I don't think this is it. Something tells me, unless these are full versions,

52:49.060 --> 52:53.980
Which I doubt, because 21 full versions is an awful lot.

52:53.980 --> 52:56.900
So, I don't know.

52:56.900 --> 53:01.180
Very strange.

53:01.180 --> 53:04.700
Oh, you know what? And I would have to put your MAC address on here for you to

53:04.700 --> 53:05.780
access the Wi-Fi.

53:05.780 --> 53:09.540
So, and I can't do that because that'll boot all our listeners.

53:09.540 --> 53:13.260
Don't cry. That's alright, we can close the thing since no one's visiting.

53:13.260 --> 53:17.020
Close the damn gates, do your Wi-Fi thing, reunite mom and baby.

53:17.020 --> 53:18.280
happy happy

53:18.280 --> 53:19.800
all right

53:19.800 --> 53:21.740
so there's that i don't know it

53:21.740 --> 53:24.320
that sound actually not going to be worth the money to import

53:24.320 --> 53:30.520
unless you are a hardcore ddr collector type person

53:30.520 --> 53:31.920
if you

53:31.920 --> 53:34.100
if you're a hardcore

53:34.100 --> 53:38.120
ddr collector type person then uh...

53:38.120 --> 53:41.820
you want the soundtrack otherwise it really doesn't do you a lot of good

53:41.820 --> 53:44.540
because you can get the mp3s all over the internet

53:44.540 --> 53:46.720
illegally

53:46.720 --> 53:51.040
I think this is kind of funny because have you visited the music in every direction dot

53:51.040 --> 53:52.040
com website?

53:52.040 --> 53:57.080
They have a brand new flash game that you can play on the music in every direction website.

53:57.080 --> 54:01.000
And basically you go around and you collect these little icons but you try to avoid the

54:01.000 --> 54:05.400
bad guy who's throwing like, I don't know, little like purple waves at you.

54:05.400 --> 54:12.000
And if you, I guess you store up these icons that you collect and then you unleash the

54:12.000 --> 54:16.100
moves or if you're in the Beatmania stage you unleash your DJ power.

54:16.100 --> 54:21.320
And it slowly converts the background from something boring into like a nightclub or

54:21.320 --> 54:25.800
a dance club or a karaoke bar or something kind of cool like that.

54:25.800 --> 54:29.420
It's a little bit of a silly game, but what they're doing is that they're actually giving

54:29.420 --> 54:30.420
away prizes.

54:30.420 --> 54:33.500
If you get a high score, you can submit your score to the scoreboard, and they're giving

54:33.500 --> 54:34.500
away prizes.

54:34.500 --> 54:38.540
Not to the top scorer, but just people who submit their scores to the scoreboard.

54:38.540 --> 54:42.220
So it's a, you know, it's a random contest, which I think is kind of cool.

54:42.220 --> 54:45.420
But some of the people on there, oh my God, some of the scores are really high.

54:45.420 --> 54:48.540
Some of the people were playing this game into like level 35 and stuff.

54:48.540 --> 54:50.860
I got bored of this game after...

54:50.860 --> 54:55.220
I'm visiting the website right now, so here's some stuff in the background.

54:55.220 --> 54:58.980
I got kind of bored of it after like level 3, but I wanted to be able to show the folks

54:58.980 --> 55:00.580
in the studio what this is like.

55:00.580 --> 55:04.820
If you want to check out this game for yourself, it's called The Ultimate Club Promoter Online

55:04.820 --> 55:06.160
Game is what it's called.

55:06.160 --> 55:10.060
It's located at www.musicineverydirection.com.

55:10.060 --> 55:15.980
If you want to go directly to the game, go to musicineverydirection.com slash morphed.

55:15.980 --> 55:21.500
M O R P H E D. Why they're calling it morphed, I have no idea, maybe that's the company that

55:21.500 --> 55:26.380
wrote this, who knows. But the game is available for you to play.

55:26.380 --> 55:30.020
And here's our copy, downloaded here, because I've got to show this to you guys in studio

55:30.020 --> 55:31.900
because you'll think this is kind of funny here.

55:31.900 --> 55:35.460
So here you go, you're going to go get icons, and then you're going to unleash your dance

55:35.460 --> 55:41.780
move, and then you're gonna morph the club. So here I go, woo! I'm going around, and oop!

55:41.780 --> 55:48.900
I gotta dodge the bad guy there, and, what the hell is that? There's some arrows. There's

55:48.900 --> 55:52.060
a little bit of funky boogie playing in the background there. And watch, I'm gonna unleash

55:52.060 --> 55:59.060
and

55:59.680 --> 56:01.680
and

56:01.680 --> 56:06.680
i want to know what the suckers they got to be the captures for this

56:06.680 --> 56:10.680
anyway, you get the idea there

56:10.680 --> 56:13.560
it's a little silly

56:13.560 --> 56:16.160
enough funk boogie, shut up

56:16.160 --> 56:20.320
let's see what they're giving away here on this side, you have until january 30th 2006

56:20.320 --> 56:26.180
If you get first place, you get a copy of either Ultramix 3 or Xtreme 2, a copy of Karaoke

56:26.180 --> 56:35.400
Revolution Party, a t-shirt and CDs, which most of us already own, except for the t-shirt.

56:35.400 --> 56:38.800
And yeah, some of us even have the t-shirt, my t-shirt is BeatMania though, which I don't

56:38.800 --> 56:43.960
think is one of the prizes here, so that's kind of special.

56:43.960 --> 56:48.360
Second place, you get a copy of the game, you just don't get, what don't you get in

56:48.360 --> 56:49.360
the second place?

56:49.360 --> 56:53.440
you only get karaoke revolution party and in third place you just get the

56:53.440 --> 56:58.240
t-shirt and a CD nobody wins a date with now key no nobody wins a date with now

56:58.240 --> 57:03.080
okay I'm sorry to say check that out music in every direction calm and I'm

57:03.080 --> 57:08.400
being really nice you know I could have not told you about that I could have not

57:08.400 --> 57:12.120
told you about that and had more of a chance to win myself but we're nice here

57:12.120 --> 57:17.280
at orange lunch radio and we want to share with you guys what's going on

57:17.280 --> 57:28.880
also in the news hmm one other little thing here I wanted to say oh yes song

57:28.880 --> 57:39.800
pack 14 and song pack 26 are out on xbox live ultramix 3 ddr ultramix 3 song pack

57:39.800 --> 57:43.800
26 rumored to only be out there for a limited time it's going to disappear by

57:43.800 --> 57:48.960
the new year so song pack 26 is kind of like a Christmas present it's free it's

57:48.960 --> 57:56.480
one song it's a remix of love me do and it sucks it really sucks the steps are

57:56.480 --> 57:59.140
kind of fun though so it's definitely worth a download and hey it's free so

57:59.140 --> 58:09.480
you can't complain too much free song so anyway if you hit an animal crossing if

58:09.480 --> 58:12.200
you hit start you can do end the party or whatever and that'll that'll boot

58:12.200 --> 58:18.840
everybody from the village anyway song pack 14 song pack 14 is out as well and

58:18.840 --> 58:22.160
I'm doing this off the top of my head but it has a new never aka song in it it

58:22.160 --> 58:26.640
has I think it's called evolution it has goblin the couple but I thought it's

58:26.640 --> 58:30.380
funny because they don't credit goblin the couple to Tomosuke they credit it to

58:30.380 --> 58:34.080
DJ mojo or something like that I don't know they give it a different credit

58:34.080 --> 58:40.400
which I thought was weird also in there was a remix of ghost

58:40.400 --> 58:46.700
revival I want to say and some other crappy remix I think was in there too

58:46.700 --> 58:51.440
really nothing to scream about I haven't been too excited over these song packs

58:51.440 --> 58:56.240
but judging from the general reaction on DDR freak it seems to be getting an okay

58:56.240 --> 58:59.320
reception especially when it comes to the steps because I will give it that

58:59.320 --> 59:04.040
the steps are something kind of new and especially in one song that I played I

59:04.040 --> 59:08.860
want to say it was the ghost revival remix there's something about Brazilian

59:08.860 --> 59:11.900
the anthem. I don't know if that was a previous Pamani song or if that's just coming from

59:11.900 --> 59:17.580
nowhere. They all have some kind of interesting steps, like patterns you don't usually see

59:17.580 --> 59:21.660
in DDR, which is kind of phenomenal when you consider they've done hundreds and hundreds

59:21.660 --> 59:25.300
of DDR songs at this point, and, you know, there's only the four arrows. There's only

59:25.300 --> 59:29.620
so many different types of patterns you can do. You kind of see some different stuff happening

59:29.620 --> 59:36.020
in these songs, so you have that to look forward to to download. So check that out over on

59:36.020 --> 59:43.420
Xbox Live all right now I know you guys haven't had a chance to check out these

59:43.420 --> 59:47.060
song packs so I wouldn't expect that you already have this up or whatever so

59:47.060 --> 59:51.300
anyway we are going to open up our skype line that's over at www.orangehonestradio.com

59:51.300 --> 59:57.420

59:57.420 --> 01:00:00.420

01:00:31.340 --> 01:00:35.340
Hello, you're on Orange Lounge Radio. Hey, Sky, Ziggy here.

01:00:35.340 --> 01:00:37.340
Hey, how you doing? What's on your mind?

01:00:37.340 --> 01:00:42.340
Well, I just want to say, you know, Christmas is already coming in a week,

01:00:42.340 --> 01:00:47.340
and, you know, for Christians over there, Merry Christmas to everyone.

01:00:49.340 --> 01:00:54.340
And happy holidays to you too, my friend. Christmas, Hanukkah, Kwanzaa, Festivus,

01:00:54.340 --> 01:00:57.340
whatever the case may be for you folks out there.

01:00:57.340 --> 01:01:00.340
A politically correct winner to you.

01:01:00.340 --> 01:01:08.340
Have you ever watched the video of Love is Dreaminess from BeatMania US where L.E.D. is playing?

01:01:08.340 --> 01:01:11.340
What song again? Love is Feelin'?

01:01:11.340 --> 01:01:12.340
Love is Dreaminess.

01:01:12.340 --> 01:01:15.340
Oh, Love is Dreaminess. No, what is this about?

01:01:15.340 --> 01:01:22.340
Love is Dreaminess is confirmed for BeatMania US.

01:01:22.340 --> 01:01:27.700
okay right on um and um so what's this there's a video of him out there

01:01:27.700 --> 01:01:32.220
actually playing it on the internet or what's going on um yeah he did play a

01:01:32.220 --> 01:01:38.500
love is dream in this it's uh the player choose he plays on a player two side and

01:01:38.500 --> 01:01:45.060
he got an a for playing it even though it's 134k on his a score where did this

01:01:45.060 --> 01:01:48.220
video come from was a him playing on an arcade machine or is it him playing on

01:01:48.220 --> 01:01:52.620
BeatMania USA? Where was it taken? What is this going on here?

01:01:52.620 --> 01:01:59.180
I think somebody linked it on the Bemani style or VG Army where LED is playing BeatMania

01:01:59.180 --> 01:02:05.900
US with a 2DX controller. With one of the official ones?

01:02:05.900 --> 01:02:10.580
Yeah, the KOC one. Oh, that's pretty cool.

01:02:10.580 --> 01:02:16.000
And they haven't altered it or anything? I mean it's exactly as the Japanese one?

01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:17.300
like video and everything?

01:02:17.300 --> 01:02:20.840
The video itself is exactly from the chapter

01:02:20.840 --> 01:02:24.540
I think you just cut out a little bit

01:02:24.540 --> 01:02:27.720
We were losing you a little bit there. I think you're back here. You're here for a

01:02:27.720 --> 01:02:30.980
minute there. Yeah, I can hear you. Okay, that's weird.

01:02:30.980 --> 01:02:36.500
Okay, so it has the same video and everything, so not a lot has changed there.

01:02:36.500 --> 01:02:38.700
Nothing's changed.

01:02:38.700 --> 01:02:39.520
Okay.

01:02:39.520 --> 01:02:40.480
So,

01:02:40.480 --> 01:02:43.780
the only thing that made me disappointed was, you know, the scoring, so I think they better

01:02:43.780 --> 01:02:44.960
tune that up

01:02:44.960 --> 01:02:45.860
to the standard

01:02:45.860 --> 01:02:48.520
Did it have the art at the end?

01:02:48.520 --> 01:02:52.580
Oh, the score result? No.

01:02:52.580 --> 01:02:57.100
Is it an early build of the game, or are they thinking it's the final build, or what?

01:02:57.100 --> 01:02:59.800
Some are semi-final build.

01:02:59.800 --> 01:03:01.140
Okay, interesting.

01:03:01.140 --> 01:03:03.220
It's a lot of purple interface.

01:03:03.220 --> 01:03:08.740
How are you feeling about BeatMania USA at this point?

01:03:08.740 --> 01:03:13.460
If they don't put any goalie background result videos, I mean the background

01:03:13.460 --> 01:03:22.460
of GoldieArts, I don't think I'll, you know, I'll think about it buying it or not.

01:03:22.460 --> 01:03:25.460
But what about those new controllers? You know, the rumor of the new controllers?

01:03:25.460 --> 01:03:28.460
Well, you probably have an arcade style, so what do you care, right?

01:03:28.460 --> 01:03:32.460
Well, KOC, not arcade style controller.

01:03:32.460 --> 01:03:38.460
But the rumor is that the Konami controller they're going to release here stateside is better than the one in Japan.

01:03:38.460 --> 01:03:42.460
I heard from Floatwalk that it's going to be spring-loaded.

01:03:42.460 --> 01:03:46.480
interesting you know it and of course all this kind of stuff is a matter of

01:03:46.480 --> 01:03:49.840
preference as well there's nothing to say that you know one is better than the

01:03:49.840 --> 01:03:55.660
other because that all kind of stuff is relative but I you know I I don't know I

01:03:55.660 --> 01:03:59.560
mean if it doesn't stick as much and they do a different kind of thing with

01:03:59.560 --> 01:04:03.480
the keys so the buttons don't stick you know they'll do that whole thing then or

01:04:03.480 --> 01:04:07.480
has a different slightly different look maybe to it or whatever it could be a

01:04:07.480 --> 01:04:15.040
more widely popular controller we'll see speaking of sticking uh-huh I just

01:04:15.040 --> 01:04:19.720
noticed on my controller like I don't exactly press the center of the key but

01:04:19.720 --> 01:04:23.400
I mostly on the white keys I press the top and then the black keys I press in

01:04:23.400 --> 01:04:27.520
the bottom and then there are like scratches that causes the you know

01:04:27.520 --> 01:04:33.680
discusses the stickiness you should do what I did with mine drop it off the top

01:04:33.680 --> 01:04:41.680
of the van, it's never broken. I can't imagine how that worked. That would kill me. It happened

01:04:41.680 --> 01:04:48.840
at Anime Expo 2001, I think, which is when I first got my controller, and I was unloading

01:04:48.840 --> 01:04:54.660
it from the van, it was stuck up at the very top, and it fell face down. But my controller

01:04:54.660 --> 01:05:00.400
has never stuck, except like one key, and I cleaned it and it worked. It's like my controller

01:05:00.400 --> 01:05:03.480
controller is the super controller of all 2DX controllers.

01:05:03.480 --> 01:05:07.320
I'm thinking the Virgin Mary lives in your controller or something because that's a miracle.

01:05:07.320 --> 01:05:10.420
I know, I should probably, you know, take a picture of the circuit board and say, look

01:05:10.420 --> 01:05:11.420
it's Jesus.

01:05:11.420 --> 01:05:13.420
Yeah, you really should.

01:05:13.420 --> 01:05:16.100
Have you ever tried the Vaseline mod, Darkspockada?

01:05:16.100 --> 01:05:17.160
To do what?

01:05:17.160 --> 01:05:18.160
The Vaseline mod?

01:05:18.160 --> 01:05:19.160
No, I haven't.

01:05:19.160 --> 01:05:22.340
All I've done is just clean the contacts.

01:05:22.340 --> 01:05:27.760
I've been doing it every, you know, every two weeks whenever I play 2DX.

01:05:27.760 --> 01:05:29.220
It works fine.

01:05:29.220 --> 01:05:33.660
I actually never had any problem with my, it was only one of them that stuck and that

01:05:33.660 --> 01:05:37.100
was the one that I would always slam on with my thumb.

01:05:37.100 --> 01:05:42.460
And I just, you know, rotated the keys, cleaned them out, worked just fine.

01:05:42.460 --> 01:05:45.500
Now what bothers me is playing on the shaved ones.

01:05:45.500 --> 01:05:47.100
I don't like shaved keys.

01:05:47.100 --> 01:05:48.100
That's irritating.

01:05:48.100 --> 01:05:52.460
And I don't actually like the ones where they put the little bit of rubber or foam under

01:05:52.460 --> 01:05:56.380
the key to press the contact up.

01:05:56.380 --> 01:05:57.860
It just doesn't, that's not comfortable.

01:05:57.860 --> 01:06:03.860
Sorry, it's just really funny because you guys are talking about putting Vaseline on your keys and shaving it, and all this other stuff.

01:06:03.860 --> 01:06:05.860
You are a pervert, Mr. Rob!

01:06:05.860 --> 01:06:10.860
My mind is going right to third grade. Can you actually use KY for the mod as well?

01:06:10.860 --> 01:06:13.860
I'm sure KY would work just as well as Vaseline.

01:06:16.860 --> 01:06:17.860
Sicko.

01:06:17.860 --> 01:06:21.860
I'm going to shave my controller and put KY all over it.

01:06:23.860 --> 01:06:26.860
Where's the ferret? I need to hit Rob with something.

01:06:26.860 --> 01:06:28.860
I was having a sit-in for you earlier.

01:06:28.860 --> 01:06:30.860
I had it.

01:06:30.860 --> 01:06:31.860
Anyway.

01:06:31.860 --> 01:06:33.860
Alright, so you know what?

01:06:33.860 --> 01:06:35.860
Apparently several people in our chat room went ass.

01:06:35.860 --> 01:06:39.860
Lube up those controllers, kids, and go to town.

01:06:39.860 --> 01:06:41.860
Yeah, you do have a lot of apples.

01:06:41.860 --> 01:06:42.860
Alright.

01:06:42.860 --> 01:06:44.860
Ziggy, I'm going to go ahead and let you go.

01:06:44.860 --> 01:06:45.860
Any final thoughts, my friend?

01:06:45.860 --> 01:06:50.860
Well, nothing much else to say, but hopefully next year you get a Skype 2.0

01:06:50.860 --> 01:06:53.860
so you can see what I really look like.

01:06:53.860 --> 01:07:06.860
I fear some of our listeners, I mean not you so much my friend, but some of our listeners might be listening to us in the nude, or God knows what. I don't know if I want that webcam on everybody. So we'll see.

01:07:06.860 --> 01:07:11.860
Alright my friend, I'm going to let you go so we can get to another call, okay?

01:07:11.860 --> 01:07:18.860
Yeah, and happy new year to Orange Lounge Radio in case we don't see each other.

01:07:18.860 --> 01:07:24.860
We're going to do something next week, but it's not going to be a live show, but we should be here in two weeks.

01:07:24.860 --> 01:07:28.860
I don't know. I have to talk to the crew about that when we're on a break or something.

01:07:28.860 --> 01:07:33.860
But happy new year to you as well. Have a good holiday season.

01:07:33.860 --> 01:07:36.860
Alright? Later. Take care. Bye.

01:07:36.860 --> 01:07:41.860
Alright, we're going to do one more call here, and then we're going to take a break and try to get some freaking air in here.

01:07:41.860 --> 01:07:45.860
I actually turned on the air conditioner, so the people out front are going to kill me because it's cold out front.

01:07:45.860 --> 01:07:47.620
But, oh well, they can deal.

01:07:47.620 --> 01:07:48.620
Let's go to another break here.

01:07:48.620 --> 01:07:50.980
What's those blankets and jackets for?

01:07:50.980 --> 01:07:51.980
Not a break.

01:07:51.980 --> 01:07:52.980
A call.

01:07:52.980 --> 01:07:53.980
Hi.

01:07:53.980 --> 01:07:54.980
You're on Horns Lawn's radio.

01:07:54.980 --> 01:07:55.980
Hello.

01:07:55.980 --> 01:07:56.980
Hi.

01:07:56.980 --> 01:07:57.980
Who's this?

01:07:57.980 --> 01:07:58.980
Xander from Florida.

01:07:58.980 --> 01:07:59.980
Hello, Xander from Florida.

01:07:59.980 --> 01:08:02.440
What's on your mind?

01:08:02.440 --> 01:08:03.440
Not a whole lot.

01:08:03.440 --> 01:08:08.420
I have an interesting anecdote, if you're willing to hear it.

01:08:08.420 --> 01:08:09.420
An anecdote.

01:08:09.420 --> 01:08:10.420
We haven't heard.

01:08:10.420 --> 01:08:11.420
Okay, sure.

01:08:11.420 --> 01:08:12.420
Why not?

01:08:12.420 --> 01:08:13.420
It's a short one, so don't worry.

01:08:13.420 --> 01:08:14.420
All right.

01:08:14.420 --> 01:08:15.420
What's on your mind?

01:08:15.420 --> 01:08:21.420
Okay. I'll admit, I'm a bit of a fanboy. Up to...

01:08:21.420 --> 01:08:25.420
A fanboy of Warner Bros. Radio? That's really sweet. Oh, I'm sorry. Fanboy for what?

01:08:25.420 --> 01:08:38.420
Sort of, but... I'm a bit of a Sony and Nintendo fanboy, and for a while I was kind of down on the PSP, but I had never played it. Right?

01:08:38.420 --> 01:08:39.420
Okay.

01:08:39.420 --> 01:08:45.420
Just reading stuff on the internet, it's like, oh yeah, I don't, you know, I don't like any games on it, PSP, scrap, blah, blah, blah.

01:08:45.420 --> 01:08:50.420
But, since I don't really have any kiosks, I never really got a chance to play it or anything.

01:08:50.420 --> 01:08:51.420
Okay.

01:08:51.420 --> 01:08:53.420
I mean, I'd seen it, but I never really got a chance to play it.

01:08:53.420 --> 01:09:04.420
So, let's see, two days ago, I was at this Christmas party with my friend, and he, he's a Nintendo fanboy, and he had a DS for a long time.

01:09:04.420 --> 01:09:11.420
And it broke for a second time somehow. He must be abusing that thing if it's breaking. I don't know how he's breaking it.

01:09:11.420 --> 01:09:17.420
He's shaving it and using KY apparently on it. Which you shouldn't do with a DS. You can do that with a 2DX controller.

01:09:17.420 --> 01:09:21.420
But please kids, do not shave and lube your DS. It does not like it.

01:09:21.420 --> 01:09:24.420
Anyways.

01:09:24.420 --> 01:09:30.420
If the animals in Animal Crossing are asking you to shave your DS, just seriously, it's time to go outdoors.

01:09:30.420 --> 01:09:33.420
It is time to go out in the real outdoors. I'm sorry, go ahead.

01:09:33.420 --> 01:09:43.340
that. It broke for the second time. Anyways, so he gets it and he brings it. He buys Tokobots

01:09:43.340 --> 01:09:49.300
and a few UMDs and stuff. So he brings it and I start playing it and I'm like, hey this

01:09:49.300 --> 01:09:59.220
is actually pretty fun. I mean, it doesn't necessarily have, it doesn't have all the

01:09:59.220 --> 01:10:04.240
games that are my taste but you know I don't expect that but I actually had some fun with

01:10:04.240 --> 01:10:14.480
it you know so I mean I guess really you shouldn't diss a system even if you look at the games

01:10:14.480 --> 01:10:21.800
and you look at the reviews and they all suck don't diss it until you play it seriously

01:10:21.800 --> 01:10:27.680
yeah unless it's an end gauge we need to add that however you draw some interesting parallels

01:10:27.680 --> 01:10:32.280
here because you could say the same thing about an Xbox 360, no?

01:10:32.280 --> 01:10:36.400
Well, I'm anti-Xbox. I know, I know, because you've said you've

01:10:36.400 --> 01:10:39.760
played Xbox, though, and I think that's the difference.

01:10:39.760 --> 01:10:43.360
What's interesting, what's interesting about this is, and I'm kind of just thinking out

01:10:43.360 --> 01:10:48.400
loud here, this is all kind of coming together as I'm sitting here talking, which is not

01:10:48.400 --> 01:10:53.360
a normal for me to just talk out my ass, but you got the PSP thing going on, right, and

01:10:53.360 --> 01:10:58.600
And the PSP, if you put the PSP and the DS side by side, and you want a system that is

01:10:58.600 --> 01:11:03.480
strictly the better gaming system, I honestly think it's the DS, is the better gaming system.

01:11:03.480 --> 01:11:06.200
But of course, it also depends on the kind of games you like.

01:11:06.200 --> 01:11:09.220
I mean, the DS has a different type of game, so you got that.

01:11:09.220 --> 01:11:17.080
But the PSP, where the PSP excels, is that, well yeah, the PSP is a sexy-ass system for

01:11:17.080 --> 01:11:21.160
one, but the PSP allows you to do so much else on it, especially when you consider this

01:11:21.160 --> 01:11:22.880
2.6 firmware upgrade.

01:11:22.880 --> 01:11:26.880
Okay, you either can upgrade your firmware or you don't upgrade your firmware.

01:11:26.880 --> 01:11:33.360
You can upgrade your firmware and get podcasts, and get pictures, and get the internet wirelessly,

01:11:33.360 --> 01:11:38.120
and get movies downloaded from the internet, and get MP3s so it's practically like having

01:11:38.120 --> 01:11:39.120
an iPod.

01:11:39.120 --> 01:11:49.340
Or you can not upgrade your firmware and get all the homebrew applications including homemade

01:11:49.340 --> 01:11:54.980
shooters and emulators, although if all you want to buy a portable system for is to play

01:11:54.980 --> 01:11:59.660
NES games, that's a whole other issue. So that's where the PSP really excels, is it

01:11:59.660 --> 01:12:04.180
being a multimedia system. Okay, so now flash forward to the current competition we've got

01:12:04.180 --> 01:12:11.020
going on here. Xbox 360, not a lot of great games for the Xbox 360 right now. Hopefully

01:12:11.020 --> 01:12:15.820
some good ones on the way. Hopefully some good ones on the way. But the Xbox 360 trying

01:12:15.820 --> 01:12:22.820
to sell itself as more as the multimedia thing, the little white box that Microsoft wants

01:12:22.820 --> 01:12:27.920
in every living room, which is very interesting because that is how I see Sony positioning

01:12:27.920 --> 01:12:32.740
itself as well. Sony wants to be that little box in everybody's living room as well. Nintendo

01:12:32.740 --> 01:12:40.340
says, no, we're still about the games. Nintendo says, fuck all that other shit. Fuck turning

01:12:40.340 --> 01:12:45.720
your console into an iPod. Fuck all that other crap. We want to do something new with games

01:12:45.720 --> 01:12:50.640
and we're going to take the games thing and go in a whole new direction and do these 3D

01:12:50.640 --> 01:12:55.480
crazy controllers and all this other stuff. So it's very interesting to see that Nintendo

01:12:55.480 --> 01:13:02.160
kind of continues to be about the game strictly, but about changing the game, as they're doing

01:13:02.160 --> 01:13:06.280
with DS and the touch innovation and as they're supposedly doing with Revolution. I don't

01:13:06.280 --> 01:13:10.680
know, it's kind of interesting. I think Iwata is a fucking genius. I think

01:13:10.680 --> 01:13:14.680
I think he's taken the company in a brilliant direction, in my opinion.

01:13:14.680 --> 01:13:16.680
Yes, but it is a big gamble as well.

01:13:16.680 --> 01:13:17.680
It is.

01:13:17.680 --> 01:13:22.680
But I think they don't really have anywhere else to go if they just keep trying to battle

01:13:22.680 --> 01:13:25.680
Sony and Microsoft on their grounds, they're going to lose.

01:13:25.680 --> 01:13:28.680
The revolution could crash and burn.

01:13:28.680 --> 01:13:34.680
It could be another end gauge and it wouldn't matter because they've still sold 50 gabillion Game Boys.

01:13:34.680 --> 01:13:39.680
I think gabillion is an actual number now because Nintendo has sold that many Game Boys in different forms.

01:13:39.680 --> 01:13:43.680
If you sell more Game Boys than PS2s, I think, something like that.

01:13:43.680 --> 01:13:48.000
Oh, I'm sure. I'm sure of it. Because just the fact that, you know, think about it, how

01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:51.760
many Game Boys have you bought? I bought the first Game Boy, then I bought

01:13:51.760 --> 01:13:55.320
a Game Boy Color, and then I bought a Game Boy Advance, and then I bought a Game Boy

01:13:55.320 --> 01:14:03.240
DS. So, I don't know. It's just interesting. I mean, Nintendo has dominated the handheld

01:14:03.240 --> 01:14:07.360
market, and I really don't see anybody posing a real threat to that anytime soon, not even

01:14:07.360 --> 01:14:12.700
the PSP the PSP is bringing in a new market in my opinion I don't think the

01:14:12.700 --> 01:14:17.020
PSP is getting the same people that the Game Boy and DS is getting because it's

01:14:17.020 --> 01:14:22.140
not a gaming system at heart right it's it's a system it's an entertainment on

01:14:22.140 --> 01:14:26.500
the go system right and I'm getting yelled at in the chat room for calling

01:14:26.500 --> 01:14:31.180
the DS a Game Boy okay it's not really a Game Boy technically the DS is not a

01:14:31.180 --> 01:14:35.820
Game Boy but give me this it does have a Game Boy advanced slot right so that's

01:14:35.820 --> 01:14:38.980
what a lot of people are considering when they buy a DS is, oh, this will play all my

01:14:38.980 --> 01:14:43.740
Game Boy Advance games. So while it might not be a Game Boy, per se, and it doesn't

01:14:43.740 --> 01:14:47.500
carry the Game Boy brand, it is the evolved form of the Game Boy.

01:14:47.500 --> 01:14:51.260
But it still can't play Tetris. But it still can't play Tetris. Well, now,

01:14:51.260 --> 01:14:55.320
but it could play if they re-release Tetris or whatever, and since they re-released Dr.

01:14:55.320 --> 01:15:01.020
Mario and Puzzle League recently on one cartridge, did you notice they're not calling it Pokemon

01:15:01.020 --> 01:15:03.340
Puzzle League? They're just calling it Puzzle League. I thought that was very interesting.

01:15:03.340 --> 01:15:06.340
Let's just say we release that on one cartridge.

01:15:06.340 --> 01:15:08.340
Has that come out over here?

01:15:08.340 --> 01:15:11.340
I'm seeing ad banners for it on the internet, so I think it's out.

01:15:11.340 --> 01:15:15.340
It's not a game I'm interested in because I actually have both games on other consoles.

01:15:15.340 --> 01:15:17.340
It came out back in November.

01:15:17.340 --> 01:15:20.340
Did it? But it's nothing that I really care about.

01:15:20.340 --> 01:15:23.340
Yeah, I didn't notice either because I already have both those games.

01:15:23.340 --> 01:15:25.340
But I'm sure it's a great Christmas title.

01:15:25.340 --> 01:15:31.340
So, alright, anyway, Zander, appreciate the call.

01:15:31.340 --> 01:15:35.980
I'm glad to hear that the PSP was, you know, you had a good experience with it because

01:15:35.980 --> 01:15:40.620
that sucks to be a fanboy of something and then get really let down.

01:15:40.620 --> 01:15:41.620
You know, you know what I mean?

01:15:41.620 --> 01:15:46.820
And it's a bad thing to be a fanboy because, you know, if you just stick to one thing,

01:15:46.820 --> 01:15:48.060
you'll never broaden your horizons.

01:15:48.060 --> 01:15:51.620
Exactly, don't, don't, be careful when you get narrow-minded and especially in the case

01:15:51.620 --> 01:15:52.680
of Microsoft.

01:15:52.680 --> 01:15:55.160
When the Xbox first came out, I hated it.

01:15:55.160 --> 01:15:59.760
I thought it was a crap system because, remember the golden rule of gaming, the system is only

01:15:59.760 --> 01:16:01.400
as good as the games that are on it, right?

01:16:01.400 --> 01:16:05.840
And the Xbox had nothing going for it until they started getting DDR, they started getting

01:16:05.840 --> 01:16:10.320
Fable, they started getting Halo, and I like Halo, I know a lot of people don't, but they

01:16:10.320 --> 01:16:16.080
started getting some more games that, I know, but they started reaching out into other areas

01:16:16.080 --> 01:16:19.240
that weren't just sports and shooters, you know?

01:16:19.240 --> 01:16:20.240
But that's just me.

01:16:20.240 --> 01:16:21.240
They had a Buffy game?

01:16:21.240 --> 01:16:22.920
And they did have a Buffy game.

01:16:22.920 --> 01:16:23.920
Which is worth something.

01:16:23.920 --> 01:16:26.660
All right, Xander, we gotta let you go so we can go to break, but thanks for calling

01:16:26.660 --> 01:16:27.660
as always, okay?

01:16:27.660 --> 01:16:28.660
Any other thoughts for listeners?

01:16:28.660 --> 01:16:31.020
Uh, your taste in music still sucks.

01:16:31.020 --> 01:16:32.020
I know.

01:16:32.020 --> 01:16:36.120
But, uh, it's, I have a microphone and you don't, so that's, that's what it boils down

01:16:36.120 --> 01:16:37.120
to.

01:16:37.120 --> 01:16:38.120
All right, take care, buddy.

01:16:38.120 --> 01:16:39.120
Okay.

01:16:39.120 --> 01:16:40.120
Later.

01:16:40.120 --> 01:16:41.640
Just for that, Xander's gonna start his own radio station.

01:16:41.640 --> 01:16:44.380
It's gonna be Skye, Skye sucks.

01:16:44.380 --> 01:16:45.380
A lot.

01:16:45.380 --> 01:16:46.380
Hi, Extifer.

01:16:46.380 --> 01:16:47.380
How are you?

01:16:47.380 --> 01:16:48.380
Hi.

01:16:48.380 --> 01:16:49.380
Hit him with the trout.

01:16:49.380 --> 01:16:50.380
Do we have a microphone?

01:16:50.380 --> 01:16:54.380
Hello?

01:16:54.380 --> 01:16:58.380
I am fine, my friend.

01:16:58.380 --> 01:17:02.380
We're going to Chipotle.

01:17:02.380 --> 01:17:06.380
That's what I had for dinner.

01:17:06.380 --> 01:17:10.380
It's fine, I like the coldness.

01:17:10.380 --> 01:17:14.380
Yeah.

01:17:14.380 --> 01:17:17.020
can leave the door open that's good did you want to do a movie review real quick

um because we're letting you on the show because we eat through a feeding tube

01:17:52.460 --> 01:17:59.980
okay that took me a minute but it was actually really funny it isn't anyway

01:17:59.980 --> 01:18:06.140
there's a special place in how reserve just for Loki all right extra fur what

01:18:06.140 --> 01:18:08.140
What did you see this week?

01:18:08.140 --> 01:18:14.140
I saw Sarah Silverman's, um, something or other.

01:18:14.140 --> 01:18:16.140
The Pussy? What did you see?

01:18:16.140 --> 01:18:18.140
Yeah, what's it called? Jesus is Magic.

01:18:18.140 --> 01:18:22.140
And she is officially now my favorite comedian.

01:18:22.140 --> 01:18:26.140
Um, because she made jokes about waxed assholes.

01:18:26.140 --> 01:18:31.140
And that was just like, so on my, you know, my level of humor.

01:18:31.140 --> 01:18:35.380
Like I was just like, that is like me or whatever.

01:18:35.380 --> 01:18:38.660
I'm like, she's just like so politically incorrect.

01:18:38.660 --> 01:18:39.720
It's so great.

01:18:39.720 --> 01:18:40.560
I love it.

01:18:40.560 --> 01:18:42.620
Like how she makes fun of her, her heritage, you know,

01:18:42.620 --> 01:18:45.660
and everything she talks about how like her,

01:18:45.660 --> 01:18:47.540
her niece calls her up and she says,

01:18:47.540 --> 01:18:49.700
I had to do a report on the Holocaust.

01:18:49.700 --> 01:18:52.620
And she's like, she's like, you know,

01:18:52.620 --> 01:18:55.860
60 million people died in that.

01:18:55.860 --> 01:18:58.140
And Sarah Silverman's like, no,

01:18:58.140 --> 01:19:00.340
there was 6 million people that died in that.

01:19:00.340 --> 01:19:04.140
she's like and her niece is like no well what's the difference like that and she

01:19:04.140 --> 01:19:13.780
goes well 60 million is forget is unforgivable if you're easily offended

01:19:13.780 --> 01:19:17.620
do not see this movie yeah she's so funny is there ever everything is

01:19:17.620 --> 01:19:22.780
nothing is off-limits she got she talks about black people Asians Jews women

01:19:22.780 --> 01:19:29.780
9-11, Holocaust, AIDS, AIDS, American Airlines have a slogan.

01:19:29.780 --> 01:19:31.780
Don't ruin all the jokes.

01:19:31.780 --> 01:19:34.780
That one's the best because it'll make you like...

01:19:34.780 --> 01:19:38.780
That offended people in the audience. I don't need you alienating our listeners.

01:19:38.780 --> 01:19:40.780
You want to hear the parts of that joke?

01:19:40.780 --> 01:19:46.780
I really don't care. Your listeners like me enough to know that I really don't care.

01:19:46.780 --> 01:19:50.780
So it was a good movie. I really liked it.

01:19:50.780 --> 01:19:58.780
The musical numbers were kind of weird, and then there was a weird masturbating scene in it, which was kind of weird, too.

01:19:58.780 --> 01:20:00.780
It was really hot.

01:20:00.780 --> 01:20:03.780
Otherwise, it was a good movie. Go see it.

01:20:03.780 --> 01:20:06.780
You may want to wait for it to come out on video.

01:20:06.780 --> 01:20:08.780
Two thumbs up.

01:20:08.780 --> 01:20:14.780
Two cocks up and a flaccid... two cocks and a flaccid cock.

01:20:14.780 --> 01:20:16.780
Wait, that's two cocks and a half.

01:20:16.780 --> 01:20:18.780
Get out. Get out.

01:20:18.780 --> 01:20:19.780

01:20:21.780 --> 01:20:22.780
Alright.

01:20:22.780 --> 01:20:27.780
What kind of ranking scale is that?

01:20:27.780 --> 01:20:31.780
I give it two cocks and a pussy. It's a three-way.

01:20:31.780 --> 01:20:32.780
It's a...

01:20:32.780 --> 01:20:33.780
It's a three...

01:20:33.780 --> 01:20:35.780
You're so weird.

01:20:35.780 --> 01:20:36.780
Alright.

01:20:36.780 --> 01:20:42.780
We're gonna go to a break, kids, and try to get some air, because we're dying in the hotbox.

01:20:42.780 --> 01:20:45.780
And hopefully we'll be back and either the plug will get pulled on us...

01:20:45.780 --> 01:20:46.780
Hotbox.

01:20:46.780 --> 01:20:47.780
Shut up.

01:20:51.780 --> 01:20:54.780
Hopefully we'll be back after this with more Orange Lounge Radio.

01:20:54.780 --> 01:21:12.880

01:24:06.880 --> 01:24:13.880
The sun's gonna shine, shine through the rain

01:24:13.880 --> 01:24:17.880
On a day like today

You never want to see the sun go down

01:24:37.880 --> 01:24:44.880
Dreams always gotta be dreams, dreams, no one else could be

01:24:44.880 --> 01:24:51.880
But you never know what might be coming for you and me

01:24:51.880 --> 01:24:54.880
Yeah, it's gonna be

01:24:54.880 --> 01:24:58.880
On a day like today

01:24:58.880 --> 01:25:02.880
A whole world could change

01:25:02.880 --> 01:25:06.880
You're gonna shine

01:25:06.880 --> 01:25:09.880
Through the red

01:25:09.880 --> 01:25:12.880

01:26:11.880 --> 01:26:14.880
Into the dark of night

Akira Yamaka, before that a day like today from In the Groove, DJ Simon with

01:27:42.280 --> 01:27:46.040
Air, you get it, joke, because we said we're breaking for Air, and my baby mama

01:27:46.040 --> 01:27:51.800
from DDR Solo, starting that set off. Hope you enjoyed that, make some music. Here we

01:27:51.800 --> 01:27:55.320
are back on the show and we may or may not get the plug pulled, we'll see pretty

01:27:55.320 --> 01:27:58.440
soon here if we're gonna get the plug pulled on us for maintenance, so again if

01:27:58.440 --> 01:28:02.600
we go down, we are going to be down all night, so we apologize, but we thank you

01:28:02.600 --> 01:28:05.560
of course for sticking with us and listening, especially after last week

01:28:05.560 --> 01:28:09.080
because last week was kind of sucky because we had the plague, all of us.

01:28:09.080 --> 01:28:13.400
We had the... and it's so weird now because I don't feel, you know, sick at all, you know,

01:28:13.400 --> 01:28:19.400
no remnants or anything, and I thank Airborne for helping me get over my cold or mini plague

01:28:19.400 --> 01:28:20.880
or whatever it was I had very quickly.

01:28:20.880 --> 01:28:22.680
I was very happy about that.

01:28:22.680 --> 01:28:28.840
So I wasn't very happy about... very happy about getting over that cold quick, but, you

01:28:28.840 --> 01:28:31.760
know, it sucks that we didn't have a show, but at least you got the podcast, right?

01:28:31.760 --> 01:28:35.080
Which was interesting because it was our 50th podcast and we were all sick as hell.

01:28:35.080 --> 01:28:37.080
I still have the plague.

01:28:37.080 --> 01:28:41.080
I know you still have the plague, but the mini-plague is gone.

01:28:41.080 --> 01:28:43.080
But I'm going to take that Airborne stuff more often now.

01:28:43.080 --> 01:28:46.080
That's some good stuff. I'm going to take one of those every day, see what happens.

01:28:46.080 --> 01:28:48.080
See if it makes me a strong boy.

01:28:48.080 --> 01:28:49.080
Can't you just take a multivitamin?

01:28:49.080 --> 01:28:54.080
I've thought about that too, but the thing I like about Airborne is that it actually makes a drink.

01:28:54.080 --> 01:28:56.080
Kind of. And the drink's not bad.

01:28:56.080 --> 01:28:58.080
I've had worse things in my life, so we'll see.

01:28:58.080 --> 01:29:03.080
It's one of those acquired tastes kind of things. We'll see.

01:29:03.080 --> 01:29:06.840
Anyway, I'm curious here, because we're getting into the Christmas season, first I want to

01:29:06.840 --> 01:29:09.640
know what's on your Christmas list.

01:29:09.640 --> 01:29:13.000
I want to know what's on our host Christmas list, what's on your Christmas list, maybe

01:29:13.000 --> 01:29:18.760
gaming-wise or maybe just anything-wise, and what your plans are for this lovely Christmas

01:29:18.760 --> 01:29:19.760
break coming up.

01:29:19.760 --> 01:29:24.360
Or Hanukkah, so you know what I mean, when I say Christmas I mean all that, okay?

01:29:24.360 --> 01:29:29.620
We are not going to be politically correct on this program, we're putting it all under

01:29:29.620 --> 01:29:34.380
the label of Christmas, which is probably not extremely politically correct, but you

01:29:34.380 --> 01:29:35.380
know how it goes.

01:29:35.380 --> 01:29:37.060
So, Loki, I'll start with you, my friend.

01:29:37.060 --> 01:29:40.220
What's on your Christmas list, and what are you going to do for the holidays?

01:29:40.220 --> 01:29:44.780
I don't really have anything on my Christmas list since I've already bought my 360.

01:29:44.780 --> 01:29:47.820
I just... probably an HDTV, I guess.

01:29:47.820 --> 01:29:53.620
If I were to ever get one, that would be almost impossible because they're expensive.

01:29:53.620 --> 01:29:55.340
But other than that, I don't know.

01:29:55.340 --> 01:29:58.420
There's not really any games I want.

01:29:58.420 --> 01:30:03.540
I have to wait, I guess. Dead or Alive, I guess I could try to go get that since, um...

01:30:03.540 --> 01:30:05.640
that's supposed to come out this week.

01:30:05.640 --> 01:30:07.540
Assuming it doesn't get pushed back again.

01:30:07.540 --> 01:30:12.700
Just in time for the holiday. They're airing the commercials on TV and everything, you just think that could be out?

01:30:12.700 --> 01:30:15.820
Actually, no, I take that back. It's not coming out this week. It's coming out next week.

01:30:15.820 --> 01:30:17.100
The 29th.

01:30:17.100 --> 01:30:20.820
Just in time for the gift certificates and the holiday returns. Yes, exactly.

01:30:20.820 --> 01:30:26.900
Um, so maybe I'll get that. I'm not a huge fighting game fan, but it looked good, so...

01:30:26.900 --> 01:30:27.940
I'll check it out.

01:30:27.940 --> 01:30:30.420
Ummm...

01:30:30.420 --> 01:30:35.540
I don't know, there's really not too much I want.

01:30:35.540 --> 01:30:39.300
Just, I don't know, HDTV I guess I could need one of those. I need to finish my cabinet.

01:30:39.300 --> 01:30:44.060
I need time to finish my cabinet.

01:30:44.060 --> 01:30:47.620
It's been a while. I need to finish it.

01:30:47.620 --> 01:30:49.500
Get the other controllers done.

01:30:49.500 --> 01:30:55.420
But, I'm kind of holding back because I don't have any place to store them if I were to finish them.

01:30:55.420 --> 01:30:57.820
Storage is a big issue.

01:30:57.820 --> 01:31:01.420
Um, but as far as Christmas plans go, uh...

01:31:01.420 --> 01:31:06.320
Playing a lot of Xbox Live, hopefully, because I did pay for a year of it, and I want to

01:31:06.320 --> 01:31:08.020
kind of get some use out of it.

01:31:08.020 --> 01:31:09.060
Um...

01:31:09.060 --> 01:31:14.140
And also, I'm supposed to go to my sister's house for Christmas,

01:31:14.140 --> 01:31:15.940
but she's local, so...

01:31:15.940 --> 01:31:17.120
Um...

01:31:17.120 --> 01:31:21.060
That's pretty much it, though. It's just going to be pretty low-key.

01:31:21.060 --> 01:31:24.060
Low-key. Low-key.

01:31:27.060 --> 01:31:31.060
For Christmas, I want world peace.

01:31:31.060 --> 01:31:36.060
I want a lot of booty, too. I want some booty calls. No, just kidding.

01:31:36.060 --> 01:31:44.060
Or am I? I like my Netflix a lot, so I want free Netflix, so I don't have to pay for it anymore,

01:31:44.060 --> 01:31:49.060
because I'm loving that thing ever since I got that. Now I don't have to buy DVDs anymore.

01:31:49.060 --> 01:31:54.220
more. But if people do want to buy me DVDs, I'm always a sucker for, you know, gift certificates

01:31:54.220 --> 01:31:59.580
and stuff. Let's see, what else do I want? I kind of want an Xbox 360 and I kind of don't.

01:31:59.580 --> 01:32:02.060
Like, you can wait. But if somebody wanted to give me one for Christmas, hey, I wouldn't

01:32:02.060 --> 01:32:06.780
mind. I'd get that other Xbox out of there and get the other Xbox in there, the 360.

01:32:06.780 --> 01:32:10.580
Because it definitely is pretty, and I do happen to have an HDTV, so it looks very,

01:32:10.580 --> 01:32:14.380
very pretty. I already kind of bought myself an early Christmas present. I bought myself

01:32:14.380 --> 01:32:18.140
a new phone, because my old phone, this is what I did last weekend since we kind of ended

01:32:18.140 --> 01:32:23.200
up not doing a show. I have a new phone here and it actually takes a video which

01:32:23.200 --> 01:32:29.560
is an incredibly useless feature until we like go to E3 or something where you

01:32:29.560 --> 01:32:32.720
know video is going to be something we're very glad we have so I'm happy to

01:32:32.720 --> 01:32:37.100
have a phone that does video. I'll have my camcorder. It's kind of need to be

01:32:37.100 --> 01:32:40.520
able to upload video and it does it does make a pixel pictures so I'm kind of

01:32:40.520 --> 01:32:43.320
impressed so that was the Christmas present I bought myself. I don't actually

01:32:43.320 --> 01:32:47.080
have a lot planned for Christmas because I have a very small family it's just me

01:32:47.080 --> 01:32:51.080
my mom my dad that are gonna get together this year that's it so um my

01:32:51.080 --> 01:32:55.360
mom wants to see memoirs of a go show so I suppose I'll endows that let it go see

01:32:55.360 --> 01:33:00.000
she actually she wants to see Brokeback Mountain too which I really want to see

01:33:00.000 --> 01:33:03.140
of course too but I don't think that's going to be out here on Christmas it's

01:33:03.140 --> 01:33:08.460
in that limited release thing you know I think they're afraid of releasing it in

01:33:08.460 --> 01:33:13.820
the red states so to speak because you know I guess people in red states quote

01:33:13.820 --> 01:33:18.500
quote unquote, can't appreciate a good gay cowboy movie, but I've read the book and there's

01:33:18.500 --> 01:33:21.980
more to it than the gay cowboy thing. The media is really putting the spin on it.

01:33:21.980 --> 01:33:27.700
It's just like, oh my God, it's Gay Cowboys Fucking. No, it's not Gay Cowboys Fucking

01:33:27.700 --> 01:33:32.180
is not what the movie's about. It's a tale of forbidden love. Romeo and Juliet was a

01:33:32.180 --> 01:33:38.100
tale about forbidden love, okay? That is what the movie is really about. It's not about

01:33:38.100 --> 01:33:43.780
Jake Gyllenhaal doing Heath Ledger in the Booty Hole, although that might be a plus.

01:33:43.780 --> 01:33:49.660
DarkSakura, what are your Christmas wishes, and what do you have planned for this Christmas?

01:33:49.660 --> 01:33:56.780
I want a memory foam contour pillow, or a Soba Kawa pillow, very, very much.

01:33:56.780 --> 01:34:03.300
And I don't really want any video game systems because I already own them all.

01:34:03.300 --> 01:34:07.500
I do want a copy of Emerald Dragon for PC Engine.

01:34:07.500 --> 01:34:09.180
I've wanted that game for a while.

01:34:09.180 --> 01:34:11.240
Um, and of course, uh,

01:34:11.240 --> 01:34:15.220
panorama cotton for the master system. Good luck.

01:34:15.220 --> 01:34:20.280
Someone must have tossed down six hundred dollars on me. I am not opposed to that.

01:34:20.280 --> 01:34:23.900
Um, I also want a tapeworm.

01:34:23.900 --> 01:34:27.580
Like one that won't kill me, but that will eat all my extra food.

01:34:27.580 --> 01:34:29.560
I'd actually like my appetite back.

01:34:29.560 --> 01:34:31.940
And I'd like to be over the plague.

01:34:31.940 --> 01:34:33.780
And I want a hippopotamus for Christmas.

01:34:33.780 --> 01:34:35.780
I want to get the pot of this.

01:34:35.780 --> 01:34:37.780
Wasn't that in your little pre-show tonight?

01:34:37.780 --> 01:34:38.780
Yep.

01:34:38.780 --> 01:34:40.780
I want a penguin for Christmas.

01:34:40.780 --> 01:34:42.780
I want a compound.

01:34:42.780 --> 01:34:46.780
So that we can hole up in it and drink red Kool-Aid.

01:34:46.780 --> 01:34:48.780
Sounds like fun.

01:34:48.780 --> 01:34:49.780
Lots of fun.

01:34:49.780 --> 01:34:52.780
And I need season 8 of Stargate.

01:34:52.780 --> 01:34:53.780
Fox set.

01:34:53.780 --> 01:34:54.780
Very much so.

01:34:54.780 --> 01:34:58.780
And the Sony Ericsson Vodafone new one.

01:34:58.780 --> 01:35:00.780
I need that too.

01:35:00.780 --> 01:35:04.820
You know what movie, because you brought up a good point about like hippopotamuses and

01:35:04.820 --> 01:35:08.580
the animals we went for Christmas, do you know what movie I finally saw because nobody

01:35:08.580 --> 01:35:10.180
would go see it with me in the theater?

01:35:10.180 --> 01:35:11.180
Madagascar?

01:35:11.180 --> 01:35:12.180
No.

01:35:12.180 --> 01:35:13.180
March of the Penguins.

01:35:13.180 --> 01:35:14.180
Oh.

01:35:14.180 --> 01:35:15.180
I finally saw on DVD.

01:35:15.180 --> 01:35:16.180
I would see that.

01:35:16.180 --> 01:35:19.580
You know what the big surprise was about March of the Penguins?

01:35:19.580 --> 01:35:20.580
Boring.

01:35:20.580 --> 01:35:21.580
Fucking boring.

01:35:21.580 --> 01:35:28.760
I love penguins, love penguins, but the movie was very boring and dry and there were dead

01:35:28.760 --> 01:35:32.960
baby penguins, which for a penguin fan, no, no, no, you do not show me dead baby penguins

01:35:32.960 --> 01:35:39.440
because that was sad. I couldn't take that. No club seals? No club, dead frozen baby penguins.

01:35:39.440 --> 01:35:44.800
Who wants to see that? Honestly. And this is a G-rated movie, boys and girls. I was

01:35:44.800 --> 01:35:52.960
very sad about that. So, anything else on your Christmas wish list and Christmas plans,

01:35:52.960 --> 01:35:58.960
Um, I want a coffee pot. Like a nice one. That does lattes.

01:35:58.960 --> 01:36:02.960
Ooh, like a Frappuccino maker or whatever they call it.

01:36:02.960 --> 01:36:04.960
Sort of like the big machines they have at Starbucks.

01:36:04.960 --> 01:36:06.960
Espresso machine.

01:36:06.960 --> 01:36:12.960
And I want the Foamy the Squirrel DVDs, even though Foamy's voice gives me a headache.

01:36:12.960 --> 01:36:16.960
Because it's all about the guy that works at Starbucks.

01:36:16.960 --> 01:36:18.960
I didn't know they actually released that on DVD now.

01:36:18.960 --> 01:36:23.640
Yeah, they're probably the squirrels DVDs and actually I want the the squirrely raft t-shirt, too

01:36:23.640 --> 01:36:26.260
You know, we need to release the DVD. We should do

01:36:26.840 --> 01:36:33.740
Hey, maybe that'll be an upcoming event for 2006. We'll see we have our own best of DVD release

01:36:33.740 --> 01:36:38.720
We'll see. We'll see we can do we've got a lot of stuff in store for 2006 here at orange launch radio

01:36:38.720 --> 01:36:42.880
Yeah, I think we do including me moving to Antarctica. You know, the t-shirt thing is gonna happen

01:36:42.880 --> 01:36:44.660
I got to talk to you guys about that after the show

01:36:44.660 --> 01:36:50.180
But with the t-shirts are happening kids there will be shirts like very very soon like January soon

01:36:50.220 --> 01:36:53.480
We're hoping if we get our logo done and everything we're gonna have shirts

01:36:53.480 --> 01:37:00.400
It's very exciting because you guys been begging us for shirts for a long time, so we're gonna make that happen very soon

01:37:00.860 --> 01:37:02.860
That's kind of our Christmas present to you

01:37:03.860 --> 01:37:08.140
Because we live our fans in it in addition to doing this show all the time

01:37:10.580 --> 01:37:12.580
All right anyway

01:37:12.580 --> 01:37:16.920
Well, it looks like we got past eight o'clock and we're still going, so I'm thinking that

01:37:16.920 --> 01:37:21.940
means unless Live 365 is being slow, we are safe from getting dropped tonight, so that's

01:37:21.940 --> 01:37:22.940
good.

01:37:22.940 --> 01:37:25.580
Let's move on into the cage match, boys and girls.

01:37:25.580 --> 01:37:30.100
Let's do an orange lounge, good old-fashioned beat-down cage match type thing.

01:37:30.100 --> 01:37:39.460
All right, the way the cage match works is we're going to play three songs for you guys,

01:37:39.460 --> 01:37:43.300
And you guys are going to pick your favorite, and the winning song goes into rotation all

01:37:43.300 --> 01:37:48.380
week long on Orange Lounge Radio's Babani music and video game music program.

01:37:48.380 --> 01:37:50.380
Okay, so you guys are just going to vote for your favorite.

01:37:50.380 --> 01:37:54.900
Let's see, two weeks ago, since we didn't do a show last week, we had this song win,

01:37:54.900 --> 01:38:00.060
and it's actually a DDR artist who actually won the cage match.

01:38:00.060 --> 01:38:02.060
The artist's name is Tess.

01:38:02.060 --> 01:38:07.060
It's Tess, and the song is called The Second You Sleep, I Stay To Watch You Fade Away,

01:38:07.060 --> 01:38:09.060
and we're going to go ahead and play this song for you guys.

01:38:09.060 --> 01:38:14.560
But you only get a clip because it actually already won a couple weeks ago, so you only get a clip of it.

01:38:14.560 --> 01:38:19.060
And it's going for a third week, second win, tonight in the Cage Match.

01:38:19.060 --> 01:38:21.560
So enjoy or don't, it's your decision.

01:38:21.560 --> 01:38:25.560
But it is last week's winner here. It is song number one test the second you sleep enjoy

01:38:51.560 --> 01:38:54.560
I dream of you tonight

01:38:54.560 --> 01:38:58.560
Tomorrow you'll be gone

01:38:58.560 --> 01:39:05.560
I wish my God would stay

01:39:05.560 --> 01:39:11.560
I'll stay awake

01:39:11.560 --> 01:39:18.560
I'll stay awake and watch you breathe

01:39:18.560 --> 01:39:22.060
I'll stay awake and watch it flow

01:39:23.060 --> 01:39:26.060
Away into the night

01:39:26.560 --> 01:39:33.060
Escape into a dream

01:39:35.060 --> 01:39:40.060
I'll stay awake and watch it fade away

01:39:40.060 --> 01:39:43.560
I dream of you tonight

01:39:43.560 --> 01:39:47.060
Tomorrow you'll be gone

01:39:47.060 --> 01:39:53.620
It gives me time to say, to watch you fade away

01:39:53.620 --> 01:40:00.820
I dream of you for life, tomorrow you'll be gone

01:40:00.820 --> 01:40:08.420
I wish by God you'd stay

01:40:08.420 --> 01:40:14.820
Hey

01:40:14.820 --> 01:40:24.820
I say to watch you fade away I dream of you tonight

01:40:24.820 --> 01:40:31.820
Tomorrow you'll be gone Excuse me, it's time to say

01:40:31.820 --> 01:40:38.820
To watch you fade away I dream of you tonight

01:40:38.820 --> 01:40:42.480
tomorrow you're all regone

01:40:42.480 --> 01:40:45.880
I wish my god could stay

01:40:45.880 --> 01:40:49.260
to watch you fade away

test of the battle of two other songs. Two other songs here tonight. Song number 2 is

01:41:17.800 --> 01:41:21.120
Dark Soccer's pick. Dark Soccer, what did you pick for our listeners tonight?

01:41:21.120 --> 01:41:26.060
It's a song I've been meaning to put in the cage for a while because we really, really

01:41:26.060 --> 01:41:32.140
need Drum and Bass represented. It's one of my favorite DJs and one of my favorite singers

01:41:32.140 --> 01:41:37.940
and it's actually one of my all-time favorite songs ever. It's DJ Crush and Espero with

01:41:37.940 --> 01:41:42.220
final home right I played it on my show a couple times so our listeners might

01:41:42.220 --> 01:41:47.740
find it familiar all right sounds good DJ crush with a thorough final home is

01:41:47.740 --> 01:41:49.740
This is song number two. Enjoy!

01:42:17.740 --> 01:42:40.820
I traveled far to find you Who knew being so far away, I would stay

01:42:40.820 --> 01:42:50.820
This weary heart, the only gift I bring

01:42:50.820 --> 01:43:00.820
This love I give to you, this lonely strain

01:43:00.820 --> 01:43:15.820
I will give you the most delicious

01:43:15.820 --> 01:43:28.820
I will give you the most delicious

01:43:28.820 --> 01:43:43.660
You see I need you to be, addicted to me I am calm, in the corners of your mouth

01:43:43.660 --> 01:43:48.900
I am still numb Will I live without?

01:43:48.900 --> 01:43:51.900
I am pure love

01:43:51.900 --> 01:43:54.900
The space inside my final

01:44:21.900 --> 01:44:23.900
Oh

01:44:51.900 --> 01:45:06.900
I will give you the most delicious kisses on your face

01:45:06.900 --> 01:45:11.900
You see I need you to be addicted to me

01:45:11.900 --> 01:45:16.900
I am calling in the corners of your mouth

01:45:16.900 --> 01:45:22.100
I am still alive I will not live without

01:45:22.100 --> 01:45:32.900
I am pure now Safe inside my final home

01:45:32.900 --> 01:45:37.900
My only time

01:45:37.900 --> 01:45:42.900
My only time

01:45:42.900 --> 01:45:47.900
My only time

01:45:47.900 --> 01:45:51.900
My only time

01:45:51.900 --> 01:45:56.900
Baby, that my final day

01:45:56.900 --> 01:46:01.900
My only hope is that

01:46:03.900 --> 01:46:08.900
We will be together

01:46:09.900 --> 01:46:14.900
We will be together

01:46:14.900 --> 01:46:37.320
The song on the tune of tonight's cage match was DJ Crush featuring Estero with Final

01:46:37.320 --> 01:46:38.320
Home.

01:46:38.320 --> 01:46:43.460
Let's go around and see if that was judged as being a good song or a poopy song by our

01:46:43.460 --> 01:46:48.460
kostjamrh That song is sexy, it gets a 10.

01:46:48.460 --> 01:46:53.460
kostjamrh It's not that sexy, it gets an 8.

01:46:53.460 --> 01:46:58.460
kostjamrh A not as sexy 8 from Loki?

01:46:58.460 --> 01:47:03.460
kostjamrh I don't know if I would call that drum and bass, that's trip-hop before I would call it drum and bass.

01:47:03.460 --> 01:47:08.460
kostjamrh But DJ Crush has almost called drum and bass.

01:47:08.460 --> 01:47:18.460
kostjamrh It's a song I could imagine myself having sex to, which is always a good thing, so I give it a 9. Very nice.

01:47:18.460 --> 01:47:24.460
kostjamrh Alright, let's get into song number 3 tonight. Loki, you picked song number 3. Loki, what did you pick for us?

01:47:24.460 --> 01:47:29.660
I picked something completely last minute. I have not even listened to this yet.

01:47:29.660 --> 01:47:33.100
So this is a suicide pick from Loki, basically.

01:47:33.100 --> 01:47:39.580
Well, originally this week I had wanted to pick, like, a remix of the Contra theme, for some reason.

01:47:39.580 --> 01:47:42.940
And I don't know why. I did download something, but it was too long.

01:47:42.940 --> 01:47:46.140
It was, like, seven minutes long because it was kind of a medley.

01:47:46.140 --> 01:47:51.260
But this is another remix. This is actually from Contra Shattered Soldier,

01:47:51.260 --> 01:47:54.980
and the remix is called Spread Your Fire Against Me.

01:47:54.980 --> 01:47:58.780
At first I thought this song was called Spread Your Legs, because I just saw the Spread Your.

01:47:58.780 --> 01:48:02.420
Oh yeah, Spread Your Fire Against Me. It's by Brain Cells and Dennis.

01:48:02.420 --> 01:48:06.500
It's song number three, and Loki better hope it's good or else it can't look like an ass.

01:48:06.500 --> 01:48:08.500
Alright, here it is. Enjoy.

01:48:36.500 --> 01:48:47.500
There's no sign of prophecy, I can't grab your hand

01:48:47.500 --> 01:48:52.500
No way, by the time you call your mind, you can't put it in your hand

01:48:52.500 --> 01:48:58.500
The day is hit, you nail your death, the night is by the door

01:48:58.500 --> 01:49:03.500
And what are you, a moving star, having had it in you before?

01:49:03.500 --> 01:49:09.500
I won't let you live and have no use to me

01:49:09.500 --> 01:49:16.500
And I know you're driving me so high up against me

01:49:25.500 --> 01:49:29.500
I will find you out of bed

01:49:29.500 --> 01:49:36.500
And after all the road is raked on fire, all can see

01:49:43.500 --> 01:49:49.500
Echos in the darkness, burning in the night

01:49:50.500 --> 01:49:56.500
Fire in the darkness, all reaching destruction to survive

01:49:56.500 --> 01:50:09.500
I am proud to be a star, to be fine, dying for the eyes

01:50:09.500 --> 01:50:16.500
Careful, you are gone now, we see the fresh eyes

01:50:16.500 --> 01:50:23.500
They won't learn from their different souls to defend tonight

01:50:23.500 --> 01:50:30.500
The world is a hell of a new town

01:50:30.500 --> 01:50:35.500
The world is a city

01:50:35.500 --> 01:50:39.500
The world is a city

01:50:39.500 --> 01:50:42.500
The spirit of time

01:50:42.500 --> 01:50:45.500
I was left in prison

01:50:45.500 --> 01:50:49.500
Asking every prayer to their kind

01:50:49.500 --> 01:50:55.500
DIE!

01:50:55.500 --> 01:51:23.500
I'm a bad ass total fighter

01:51:23.500 --> 01:51:26.140
Where the fuck is you and stop it?

01:51:26.140 --> 01:51:29.980
I look in the mirror and I'm still moving

01:51:29.980 --> 01:51:32.540
Don't leave or I'll blow

01:51:32.540 --> 01:51:35.180
Before you know it, you're dead

01:51:35.180 --> 01:51:39.180
Speak to me, you're one

01:51:41.180 --> 01:51:45.180
I'm fucking one

01:51:47.180 --> 01:51:50.140
I will lose someone, get back to me

01:51:50.140 --> 01:51:52.780
There is great time to be lost yet

01:51:52.780 --> 01:51:55.280
I will just be a stranger

01:51:55.280 --> 01:51:57.880
Still, I'm not your inspiration

01:51:57.880 --> 01:52:02.680
I'm not

01:52:08.180 --> 01:52:10.180
Song number three, God I love our challenge

01:52:10.180 --> 01:52:15.580
Song number three, Brain Cells and Dennis with, uh, Spread Your Fire Against Me

01:52:15.580 --> 01:52:18.880
Which apparently is a remix from Conquer Shattered Soldier, who knew?

01:52:18.880 --> 01:52:25.080
Uh, let's see, does that make you want to spread your fire or spread your hate? I don't know, uh, DarkSucker, what'd you think?

01:52:25.080 --> 01:52:31.680
It makes me feel like I should worship Satan or something. So it gets a minus 666.

01:52:31.680 --> 01:52:33.180
Loki.

01:52:34.180 --> 01:52:37.780
It gets a positive 666 to counteract the minus 666.

01:52:37.780 --> 01:52:39.480
So it effectively has a zero?

01:52:39.480 --> 01:52:41.880
Yes! Good thinking, Loki. Good thinking.

01:52:42.480 --> 01:52:46.080
Um, that song does make me want to smoke crack and worship Satan.

01:52:46.080 --> 01:52:51.380
Um, but, um, you know, actually it kind of reminded me of GWAR a little bit, and I started thinking about

01:52:51.380 --> 01:52:52.580
GWAR is a lot cooler!

01:52:52.580 --> 01:52:56.780
I know GWAR is a lot cooler, but didn't I just, like, imagine, like, these giant outfits?

01:52:56.780 --> 01:53:04.080
Because the thing I love about GWAR, I like, I- fuck the music with GWAR, but, uh, just them getting up in those giant costumes and thrashing about

01:53:04.080 --> 01:53:10.380
where they all look like Shao Kahn from Mortal Kombat, and they're on stage thrashing about, is really badass.

01:53:10.380 --> 01:53:13.380
And so I kind of thought about that, and that made me giggle a lot.

01:53:13.380 --> 01:53:18.380
So that song gets like a five to the number of times I laugh.

01:53:18.380 --> 01:53:23.380
Alright, but it's not up to us. We are not the final judges.

01:53:23.380 --> 01:53:27.380
You are. You kids that listen to this program out there and are in our chat room right now, you are the final say.

01:53:27.380 --> 01:53:30.380
So let's see the three songs you get to vote for tonight.

01:53:30.380 --> 01:53:36.380
Song number one as a reminder is Tess with The Second You Sleep, I Stay to Watch You Fade Away.

01:53:36.380 --> 01:53:43.580
Anyway.

01:53:43.580 --> 01:53:50.540
And song number two you can vote for tonight is DJ Crush and Astero with a song called

01:53:50.540 --> 01:53:58.420
Final Home.

01:53:58.420 --> 01:54:02.820
And song number three you can vote for tonight is Brain Cells and Dennis with Spread Your

01:54:02.820 --> 01:54:09.820
fire against me.

01:54:32.820 --> 01:54:35.940
I've got a couple of DJ Crash CDs with different mixes of it on there.

01:54:35.940 --> 01:54:39.940
It's a good time. I like it. I hope it does well, but we'll see. It's up to the chat room.

01:54:39.940 --> 01:54:45.940
So send in your votes now. Well, it looks like we didn't get the plug pulled on us, so we get to continue to do a show here.

01:54:45.940 --> 01:54:50.940
How's OLR Town going? Did you finally just close the gate and say fuck you all and now you and Jamie are playing?

01:54:50.940 --> 01:54:55.940
No, but Harold's been the only one that's joined. So I am taking this time to write OLR

01:54:55.940 --> 01:54:59.540
um, message in a bottle spam. Oh, propaganda.

01:54:59.540 --> 01:55:00.540
Good, good thinking.

01:55:00.540 --> 01:55:01.540
That was my idea.

01:55:01.540 --> 01:55:02.540
What is this?

01:55:02.540 --> 01:55:09.380
You guys are going to spam Orange Lounge Radio across Animal Crossing World by what, using

01:55:09.380 --> 01:55:10.380
the bottle?

01:55:10.380 --> 01:55:11.380
How does this work?

01:55:11.380 --> 01:55:13.900
The message in the bottle, you basically write whatever you want, put it in the bottle and

01:55:13.900 --> 01:55:14.900
drop it in the ocean.

01:55:14.900 --> 01:55:17.900
Message in a bottle, message.

01:55:17.900 --> 01:55:18.900
Pencilled.

01:55:18.900 --> 01:55:19.900
Shush.

01:55:19.900 --> 01:55:20.900
No.

01:55:20.900 --> 01:55:21.900
Penfold.

01:55:21.900 --> 01:55:22.900
Shush.

01:55:22.900 --> 01:55:29.500
No, um, it's like supposed to go to somebody else's random village, so they'll get, you

01:55:29.500 --> 01:55:31.660
should listen to Orange on radio because we said so.

01:55:31.660 --> 01:55:32.660
Very cool.

01:55:32.660 --> 01:55:35.660
We'll see if it works.

01:55:35.660 --> 01:55:42.340
Alright, um, Loki, after the cage match is usually where I go over to you and I say,

01:55:42.340 --> 01:55:44.340
hey, Loki, what's going on in the Sim scene?

01:55:44.340 --> 01:55:48.960
And you usually will say nothing, but I thought I would humor this tonight and see what's

01:55:48.960 --> 01:55:49.960
going on.

01:55:49.960 --> 01:56:02.960
Are they encouraging people to use commercial MP3s for this?

01:56:02.960 --> 01:56:11.960
No, they're encouraging people to use royalty-free MP3s or MP3s that have the permission of the artist to use.

01:56:11.960 --> 01:56:14.960
So in other words, they'll be forced to come up with something original?

01:56:14.960 --> 01:56:15.960
Something original.

01:56:15.960 --> 01:56:16.960
I like this.

01:56:16.960 --> 01:56:23.960
And then, um, so there's a contest going on there, and then I think, um, OSC4 was just finishing up.

01:56:23.960 --> 01:56:25.960
And that's about it.

01:56:25.960 --> 01:56:28.960
Oh, and, um,

01:56:28.960 --> 01:56:33.960
Siberia Style 3 has been released, um, the StepMania theme.

01:56:33.960 --> 01:56:36.960
Sexy. That's all I gotta say about that.

01:56:36.960 --> 01:56:38.960
It's awesome looking.

01:56:38.960 --> 01:56:45.960
Japanese, of course, because, you know, they kick ass when it comes to anything that has to do with DDR, SIMS, or whatever.

01:56:45.960 --> 01:56:48.960
A lot more effort being put in there.

01:56:48.960 --> 01:56:52.960
That's it. That's all that's going on in the world.

01:56:52.960 --> 01:56:54.960
Well, tell me about something going on in the hack-and-crack world,

01:56:54.960 --> 01:56:56.960
because we gotta fill time here while we get cage match votes, Tali.

01:56:56.960 --> 01:56:59.960
Well, um, apparently...

01:56:59.960 --> 01:57:00.960
Last call for cage match votes, Tali.

01:57:00.960 --> 01:57:05.960
Homebrew, um, stuff, they've gotten it to run now through version 2.5 and 2.6,

01:57:05.960 --> 01:57:11.960
using the same workaround that they've used to create that trainer for, um, Grand Theft Auto.

01:57:11.960 --> 01:57:18.840
And so they're actually using that to port homebrew to the PSP on firmwares, you know,

01:57:18.840 --> 01:57:20.840
2.5 and 2.6.

01:57:20.840 --> 01:57:25.800
So what that means is probably there'll be another firmware coming out for the PSP to

01:57:25.800 --> 01:57:28.360
break all that stuff.

01:57:28.360 --> 01:57:32.920
And then what'll happen is they'll come out with something else to break that, and the

01:57:32.920 --> 01:57:37.800
cycle keeps going on and on.

01:57:37.800 --> 01:57:44.080
And other things, there's actually been some pretty cool stuff for like the 360 being put

01:57:44.080 --> 01:57:46.240
on Xbox Live.

01:57:46.240 --> 01:57:50.880
One of them being more downloadable cars for Ridge Racer 6, which makes me happy.

01:57:50.880 --> 01:57:52.600
And those are free.

01:57:52.600 --> 01:57:55.280
They've also added some music from the other games.

01:57:55.280 --> 01:58:00.560
I saw some stuff, Warp Rider and stuff from, I think Ridge Racer for the PSP.

01:58:00.560 --> 01:58:02.960
I'm sure that was in other ones as well.

01:58:02.960 --> 01:58:05.120
But there's a lot of music in Ridge Racer.

01:58:05.120 --> 01:58:12.520
There's like four virtual CDs worth of music on there, just really good stuff.

01:58:12.520 --> 01:58:16.880
You know why I want an Xbox 360 is for that amazing seizure-inducing game that you showed

01:58:16.880 --> 01:58:17.880
to me?

01:58:17.880 --> 01:58:18.880
Geometry Wars?

01:58:18.880 --> 01:58:22.160
Yeah, I want that, which is sad because you could do Geometry Wars on like a Nintendo

01:58:22.160 --> 01:58:23.160
64.

01:58:23.160 --> 01:58:24.160
That makes me motion sick.

01:58:24.160 --> 01:58:26.960
Yeah, but I love those seizure-inducing games.

01:58:26.960 --> 01:58:29.880
I mean, it's the amazing seizure geometry game.

01:58:29.880 --> 01:58:30.880
I love it.

01:58:30.880 --> 01:58:32.000
It's great.

01:58:32.000 --> 01:58:33.000
It is pretty cool.

01:58:33.000 --> 01:58:38.240
I don't know. Cameo's pretty fun. I've been playing that a little bit. Yeah? Yeah, it's

01:58:38.240 --> 01:58:46.200
pretty cool. I am kind of digging it a bit. It's a little easy though, that's what I found.

01:58:46.200 --> 01:58:52.100
But I'm sure it gets a lot harder throughout the game. It's still pretty. And then Ridge

01:58:52.100 --> 01:58:57.560
Racer's really fun. I like that game a lot. And Call of Duty 2, the multiplayer, is really

01:58:57.560 --> 01:59:06.700
fun in that. Just, I like the multiplayer a lot in that game. And, well, I don't know.

01:59:06.700 --> 01:59:12.020
Just, overall pretty fun. I'm thinking about maybe picking up another game here. Not sure

01:59:12.020 --> 01:59:19.440
what I want to pick up though. Maybe Need for Speed. Definitely going to get Dead or

01:59:19.440 --> 01:59:25.400
live for when that comes out. Been actually pretty excited, um, they've been showing some

01:59:25.400 --> 01:59:32.120
pictures for, um, full auto, and the demo's supposed to be up pretty soon for that, and

01:59:32.120 --> 01:59:37.680
that one, oh, I can't wait for that one. Gettin' the blow up everything in the entire game.

01:59:37.680 --> 01:59:44.480
Blow up everything, uh. But they have, seriously, they should just release a game for the PSP

01:59:44.480 --> 01:59:50.040
called BLOW UP EVERYTHING or any system really, Xbox 360, I don't care. BLOW UP EVERYTHING.

01:59:50.040 --> 01:59:52.080
I would totally buy it. And that's what the commercial should be for.

01:59:52.080 --> 01:59:59.320
They sort of had a commercial like that for mercenaries. Mercenaries, when it came out

01:59:59.320 --> 02:00:03.340
on the PlayStation 2 and Xbox, you know, that was the commercial. Blow up buildings. Blow

02:00:03.340 --> 02:00:09.900
them up again. You know, blow up tanks. Fire rockets. You know, it was just the whole commercial

02:00:09.900 --> 02:00:11.440
dedicated to that, and it was great.

02:00:11.440 --> 02:00:13.440
It's a great idea.

02:00:25.440 --> 02:00:27.440
It's like carpet you can munch outside.

02:00:27.440 --> 02:00:31.440
Well, they have, like, they're talking about the PSP and being able to play it outside.

02:00:31.440 --> 02:00:36.440
Have you ever tried to play PSP outside? You can't see shit on the screen outside.

02:00:36.440 --> 02:00:39.440
Well, to be fair, it goes for most systems. You can't really see the DS outside.

02:00:39.440 --> 02:00:42.440
Exactly, but why are they trying to push it that you can play it outside?

02:00:42.440 --> 02:00:44.440
Which is why I never fucking understood.

02:00:44.440 --> 02:00:45.440
Holy at night.

02:00:45.440 --> 02:00:50.440
What was that fucking game on Game Boy Advance that was the sun? It was Konami and you had to do the sun.

02:00:50.440 --> 02:00:52.440
Yeah, I know what you're talking about.

02:00:52.440 --> 02:00:56.440
Fuck that game. I mean, seriously, fuck it in its ear.

02:00:56.440 --> 02:00:59.440
That was so stupid, that sun thing encouraging me to go outside.

02:00:59.440 --> 02:01:02.440
I can't see my game when I go outside.

02:01:02.440 --> 02:01:08.440
Well, actually that's the way he had to play it for those old systems that didn't have backlights, though.

02:01:08.440 --> 02:01:12.440
The ones that do, though, you can't see them now.

02:01:12.440 --> 02:01:18.440
Well, we're going to go to the break, kids, and when we come back I'm going to talk to you about who won the cage match.

02:01:18.440 --> 02:01:21.280
And also, when we come back, we'll probably get into the FUs of the week.

02:01:21.280 --> 02:01:24.000
Don't send them in just yet, but I know we have a little bit of angst.

02:01:24.000 --> 02:01:26.040
We need to get out of our system, so we're going to do that.

02:01:26.040 --> 02:01:29.600
And more random crap here on Orange Honors Radio when we come back.

02:01:29.600 --> 02:01:33.280
In this break, the chat room requested some more happy.

02:01:33.280 --> 02:01:37.040
So we have nothing but nauseously happy songs this break.

02:01:37.040 --> 02:01:39.320
And for some reason, I don't have Jenny Ramen here, though.

02:01:39.320 --> 02:01:40.080
I may have to fix that.

02:01:40.080 --> 02:01:41.080
We'll see.

02:01:41.080 --> 02:01:43.240
But I thought of something better than Jenny Ramen.

02:01:43.240 --> 02:01:46.600
And we're going to start it off with that really annoyingly happy song

02:01:46.600 --> 02:01:47.400
from In the Groove.

02:01:47.400 --> 02:01:51.400
So we're going to start with that, and we'll be back with more Orange on Trio after this.

02:02:17.400 --> 02:02:41.160
I am dripping with it, I love it I am dripping with it, oh I love it

02:02:41.160 --> 02:02:44.160
I just need hot water and soap

02:02:44.160 --> 02:02:47.160
Blushing on my body

02:02:48.160 --> 02:02:51.160
Blow me a bubble and I'll give you a smack

02:02:51.160 --> 02:02:54.160
Somewhere on your body

02:02:55.160 --> 02:02:58.160
Oh cookie okey, oh yeah yeah

02:02:58.160 --> 02:03:01.160
I'm a bubble dancer

02:03:02.160 --> 02:03:05.160
Oh cookie okey, oh yeah yeah

02:03:05.160 --> 02:03:08.160
Bubble Waffle Dancer

02:03:16.160 --> 02:03:19.160
Oh, yeah, yeah

02:03:19.160 --> 02:03:22.160
Bubble Waffle Dancer

02:03:52.160 --> 02:03:54.160
I

02:05:22.160 --> 02:05:37.160
Music

02:06:52.160 --> 02:06:54.160
Now it's time to go!

02:06:54.160 --> 02:06:56.160
Now it's time to go!

02:06:56.160 --> 02:06:58.160
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

02:08:28.160 --> 02:08:30.160
Oh

02:08:58.160 --> 02:09:14.280
Mr. Random Person on the Street, who, by the way, is not an actor, what do you think of

02:09:14.280 --> 02:09:16.540
the orange lounge big money music in Moore's show?

02:09:16.540 --> 02:09:23.840
The music is like being transported to just this dancing spaceship place.

02:09:23.840 --> 02:09:24.840
It's unearthly.

02:09:24.840 --> 02:09:29.840
Unearthly. It's like being in a club, except you don't have to ask someone to dance.

02:09:29.840 --> 02:09:33.840
Hi, we're back here on Orange Launch Radio, and on that break you heard happy, happy, happy music.

02:09:33.840 --> 02:09:39.840
Shusha, Cheer Train, and Bubble Dancer are on the break.

02:09:39.840 --> 02:09:43.840
My name is Shusha. Remember Shusha? Anyway.

02:09:43.840 --> 02:09:45.840
She gives everybody her kiss.

02:09:45.840 --> 02:09:49.840
Yes, that's right. You know what I actually watched on TV?

02:09:49.840 --> 02:09:53.840
I watched a little bit of Sabado Higante the other night.

02:09:53.840 --> 02:10:00.040
If you watch this, it's on Univision, the local Univision station, which is the Spanish

02:10:00.040 --> 02:10:01.040
language network.

02:10:01.040 --> 02:10:02.040
Oh, I don't watch TV.

02:10:02.040 --> 02:10:05.520
You have to make an exception for Spanish TV though, because there's some great shit

02:10:05.520 --> 02:10:06.520
on Spanish TV.

02:10:06.520 --> 02:10:07.520
Uche libre on Telemundo!

02:10:07.520 --> 02:10:08.520
Telemundo, Telemundo, Telemundo!

02:10:08.520 --> 02:10:13.120
I love that stuff, and they have the best talk shows.

02:10:13.120 --> 02:10:16.560
Sure, I can't understand half the shit they're saying, but I can pick up enough words, I

02:10:16.560 --> 02:10:20.040
kind of know what's going on, so it's just...

02:10:20.040 --> 02:10:22.280
I do love Mexican wrestling.

02:10:22.280 --> 02:10:40.360
Anyway, we decided that since we did do a happy, happy bouncy break, that we will actually

02:10:40.360 --> 02:10:43.760
do a very dark, depressing break next, so that would be fun.

02:10:43.760 --> 02:10:47.120
We're going to do our emo break next, so that would be fun.

02:10:47.120 --> 02:10:50.760
We can kind of offset that a little bit there.

02:10:50.760 --> 02:10:58.560
Anyway, and now they're having a discussion here in the chat room, talking about Sirius

02:10:58.560 --> 02:11:05.720
versus XM, which are the dueling satellite radios here.

02:11:05.720 --> 02:11:08.960
Now have you guys ever looked into getting satellite radio?

02:11:08.960 --> 02:11:13.400
My new stereo is XM compatible, but I haven't.

02:11:13.400 --> 02:11:16.200
You know, that's funny because mine is Sirius compatible, and I'm in the same boat where

02:11:16.200 --> 02:11:17.720
I haven't really decided to get that.

02:11:17.720 --> 02:11:20.100
I'm tempted though with the Stern thing.

02:11:20.100 --> 02:11:25.840
Not that I'm a huge Howard Stern fan, but I think he's interesting, and I'd be interested

02:11:25.840 --> 02:11:29.220
to hear what he has to say on the new show, but I'm sure they'll be all over the Internet

02:11:29.220 --> 02:11:30.220
and stuff.

02:11:30.220 --> 02:11:35.240
So, I've been tempted to get serious, but Dark Sakura says that we should get on satellite

02:11:35.240 --> 02:11:39.140
radio, and I tend to agree, we should be on satellite radio, but you know, Adam Curry

02:11:39.140 --> 02:11:45.340
has a show on, I think it's Sirius, and he does a show about podcasting, and I think

02:11:45.340 --> 02:11:50.660
he plays clips from different podcasts and I've actually submitted our show months ago

02:11:50.660 --> 02:11:54.960
I submitted that little promo we did to the show and never heard back so you know the

02:11:54.960 --> 02:11:58.600
best way that you could hear us on one of these stations would be to email the fuck

02:11:58.600 --> 02:12:02.000
out of these people and say hey have you heard of Orange Lawn's Radio you should include

02:12:02.000 --> 02:12:08.380
them syndicate syndicate and it's tough too because when we first started our podcast

02:12:08.380 --> 02:12:13.580
there was very few other gaming podcasts out there only a few people jumped on the bandwagon

02:12:13.580 --> 02:12:15.900
And very, very few of them are still around.

02:12:15.900 --> 02:12:20.700
I can only think of like, I think maybe two other podcasts I can think of that have been

02:12:20.700 --> 02:12:24.780
around just as long, if not longer, than we are that are still going regularly.

02:12:24.780 --> 02:12:26.680
A lot of them kind of tapered off.

02:12:26.680 --> 02:12:31.500
But now there are literally like at least a hundred video game podcasts out there on

02:12:31.500 --> 02:12:32.500
the internet right now.

02:12:32.500 --> 02:12:34.660
So it's tough for us to stand out from the rest.

02:12:34.660 --> 02:12:37.140
You know, it's getting pretty competitive out there.

02:12:37.140 --> 02:12:38.140
But we shine.

02:12:38.140 --> 02:12:39.140
Yeah, we try.

02:12:39.140 --> 02:12:40.140
We try our best.

02:12:40.140 --> 02:12:44.540
Our three shining personalities, hopefully, put us a little bit ahead of the others, but

02:12:44.540 --> 02:12:45.540
it's tough.

02:12:45.540 --> 02:12:48.980
So we really do rely on the word of mouth, and you know the voting on Podcast Alley and

02:12:48.980 --> 02:12:50.660
Yahoo and all that other crap.

02:12:50.660 --> 02:12:53.040
You know iTunes does voting now, too.

02:12:53.040 --> 02:12:57.140
So those of you kids that use iTunes, go say some nice things about us on our iTunes listing.

02:12:57.140 --> 02:13:00.180
And the link is right there on OrangeLunchRadio.com.

02:13:00.180 --> 02:13:01.180
And that shit helps.

02:13:01.180 --> 02:13:07.260
It really does, because it gets our little things bumped up a little bit, and then people

02:13:07.260 --> 02:13:09.720
notice us, and it will help.

02:13:09.720 --> 02:13:15.740
Not that we're all about being number one, because we're not.

02:13:15.740 --> 02:13:18.580
We're not going to be number one, because we don't have the corporate backing and those

02:13:18.580 --> 02:13:21.320
folks that have the corporate backing are always going to be number one.

02:13:21.320 --> 02:13:22.660
We got the people's choice.

02:13:22.660 --> 02:13:27.100
We did, we won that little thing, and that was nice, and that was strictly because of

02:13:27.100 --> 02:13:28.100
our fans.

02:13:28.100 --> 02:13:31.980
But we just want to have fun with this.

02:13:31.980 --> 02:13:35.580
And we want to bring more people, because we're a very interactive show.

02:13:35.580 --> 02:13:38.940
We like to think that's one thing that maybe sets ourselves also apart from the others,

02:13:38.940 --> 02:13:43.100
is that we're a very interactive show. So, anyway, something to think about.

02:13:44.220 --> 02:13:46.940
Shall we hear who won tonight's cage match, boys and girls?

02:13:46.940 --> 02:13:47.900
Yes, let's!

02:13:47.900 --> 02:13:51.820
All right, the winner of tonight's cage match was...

02:13:55.100 --> 02:13:56.380
Tess, once again!

02:13:59.180 --> 02:14:02.540
Because everybody loves some generic trance in their life.

02:14:03.180 --> 02:14:06.620
Enjoy that, Tess. Actually, I like that song an awful lot. Can't say a lot negative.

02:14:06.620 --> 02:14:09.820
although i was very disappointed at the voting turnout very few votes is the

02:14:09.820 --> 02:14:13.080
lowest voting turnout i've seen

02:14:13.080 --> 02:14:14.060
election day

02:14:14.060 --> 02:14:15.020
okay so

02:14:15.020 --> 02:14:19.020
more voting people's in change and get to get the word out there

02:14:19.020 --> 02:14:20.320
uh...

02:14:20.320 --> 02:14:21.620
uh...

02:14:21.620 --> 02:14:22.380
c

02:14:22.380 --> 02:14:25.080
but that that that uh... i'm trying to go to our chat room there that would be

02:14:25.080 --> 02:14:29.000
that was on the dot com the fact about uh...

02:14:29.000 --> 02:14:30.500
in the chair of the

02:14:30.500 --> 02:14:32.720
they're talking

02:14:32.720 --> 02:14:34.760
they're talking about uh...

02:14:34.760 --> 02:14:37.400
Why are they talking about Don and Drew?

02:14:37.400 --> 02:14:38.400
That podcast.

02:14:38.400 --> 02:14:39.400
That's a very...

02:14:39.400 --> 02:14:42.040
Or maybe they're trying to talk about podcasts that have been around.

02:14:42.040 --> 02:14:44.360
I'm talking about strictly video game podcasts.

02:14:44.360 --> 02:14:47.600
I know Don and Drew have been around since podcasting started.

02:14:47.600 --> 02:14:52.200
That they were the first big name couple that got on the iPod thing and started talking

02:14:52.200 --> 02:14:53.720
about their sex life or whatever it is they do.

02:14:53.720 --> 02:14:55.160
I've only listened to a little bit of the show.

02:14:55.160 --> 02:14:56.160
I'm going to be honest, kids.

02:14:56.160 --> 02:14:58.620
I don't listen to a lot of podcasts.

02:14:58.620 --> 02:15:00.480
I totally support podcasting.

02:15:00.480 --> 02:15:05.260
I think podcasting is truly the wave of the future, and I support it, but as somebody

02:15:05.260 --> 02:15:10.140
who's trying to put together an original podcast, I don't really listen to a lot of others.

02:15:10.140 --> 02:15:13.020
Which is a little bit of a controversial standpoint, because you think I could stand to learn things

02:15:13.020 --> 02:15:17.540
by listening to the podcast, but at the same time, I want to make sure our show is purely

02:15:17.540 --> 02:15:18.540
original.

02:15:18.540 --> 02:15:21.460
Well, Yanni doesn't listen to anybody else, so that all of his music is original.

02:15:21.460 --> 02:15:22.460
But Yanni sucks.

02:15:22.460 --> 02:15:23.460
Not really.

02:15:23.460 --> 02:15:26.460
I like some of Yanni's music.

02:15:26.460 --> 02:15:33.140
You know, I know. If you're into, you know, um, screaming, um, opera pigs, then, no, I'm

02:15:33.140 --> 02:15:38.780
kidding. Yanni's good if you like that kind of music, but, um, I don't, so what are you

02:15:38.780 --> 02:15:43.780
saying? We're the Yanni of podcasting? Only cooler.

02:15:43.780 --> 02:15:50.420
Alright, uh, anyway, I'm feeling a little angsty, so I think it's time to get into the

02:15:50.420 --> 02:15:56.980
FUs of the Week. What do you kids think? You want to do some angst? Anxed up, yo.

02:15:56.980 --> 02:16:01.100
Alright, let's do some angst here. Dark Soccer, of course, you know I'm always

02:16:01.100 --> 02:16:04.180
going to go over and start with you. Oh, by the way guys, you can submit your FUs of

02:16:04.180 --> 02:16:08.740
the Week right now. Go to www.orangelandtrader.com and click on

02:16:08.740 --> 02:16:12.860
chat and send a private message to Sky with your FU of the Week, if you have an

02:16:12.860 --> 02:16:15.820
FU of the Week. But you know we got to get ours out first, because we are some

02:16:15.820 --> 02:16:20.020
angsty motherfuckers. So, Dark Soccer, why is it we do the FUs of the Week every

02:16:20.020 --> 02:16:27.020
every single week. Grr. Argh.

02:16:27.020 --> 02:16:34.020
F you to the abundant amounts of rain, um, because, uh, you know, it just makes it really

02:16:44.340 --> 02:16:49.180
hard to drive when everybody else on the road is being a big dipshit. Which is the case,

02:16:49.180 --> 02:16:52.020
I've passed something like three accidents on the way here today.

02:16:52.020 --> 02:17:01.180
Another F.U. goes, of course, to the plague for not releasing me from its evil grip lately.

02:17:01.180 --> 02:17:05.540
Another one goes toward my utter lack of appetite for being sick because I've dropped fifteen

02:17:05.540 --> 02:17:09.340
pounds in the month and a half, so like none of my clothes fit me anymore, and I can't

02:17:09.340 --> 02:17:11.340
really afford to go buy new ones right now.

02:17:11.340 --> 02:17:16.540
Um, F.U. to the rock that flew off of the road and landed in my windshield and then

02:17:16.540 --> 02:17:20.780
cracked two days later so that now I have a big split across the lower half

02:17:20.780 --> 02:17:25.260
of my windshield from one end to the other and have to pay to have my

02:17:25.260 --> 02:17:35.020
windshield replaced. So uh that really uh sort of hacks me off and uh a nephew goes to the

02:17:35.020 --> 02:17:41.020
general stupidity on the internet but that's what he expected. Okay I'm done. Oh yeah one

02:17:41.020 --> 02:17:57.940
I'd like to second the stupid driver FU. I keep seeing torrential rain coming down and

02:17:57.940 --> 02:18:03.020
people driving with their headlights off still or in the fog and they're driving extremely

02:18:03.020 --> 02:18:07.380
fast in the fog without their headlights on and then they wonder why they get in the car

02:18:07.380 --> 02:18:17.740
accents, the stupid people out there. Also, I want to say if fuck you to the whole launch

02:18:17.740 --> 02:18:22.460
lineup for the 360, because there's not that much that's out there that I want to get,

02:18:22.460 --> 02:18:31.020
and I'm kind of dying to get another game. And then, finally, fuck Best Buy for just

02:18:31.020 --> 02:18:33.380
overall sucking and

02:18:33.380 --> 02:18:36.320
you know unfortunately i do have a hundred dollars

02:18:36.320 --> 02:18:41.760
gift card to best buys and i actually go there but

02:18:41.760 --> 02:18:43.800
i just don't like them

02:18:43.800 --> 02:18:46.900
they're starting to get very corporate i really don't like that where they're

02:18:46.900 --> 02:18:50.160
starting to push you know their stupid premium uh...

02:18:50.160 --> 02:18:54.460
like their replacement plans and all that crap and the whole you know geek squad

02:18:54.460 --> 02:18:56.180
it's just a very bad vibe

02:18:56.180 --> 02:18:59.240
best buy used to be cool i don't know what happened

02:18:59.240 --> 02:19:00.580
that's it

02:19:00.580 --> 02:19:07.580
the man happened seriously

02:19:09.580 --> 02:19:13.380
uh... i would say in my F.U. I'm going to third the F.U. because it seems like to

02:19:13.380 --> 02:19:17.180
driving because when it seems like it starts raining in the state

02:19:17.180 --> 02:19:19.180
uh... people forget how to drive

02:19:19.180 --> 02:19:23.540
uh... so F.U. to that. F.U. to the fact that i've got like a million and one

02:19:23.540 --> 02:19:27.940
things i need to do this next week and not enough time to do it

02:19:27.940 --> 02:19:32.860
F you to just angst in general and not feeling happy with certain things and where you're at and just

02:19:32.860 --> 02:19:35.580
God, haven't all this bullshit happened to me around Christmas?

02:19:35.580 --> 02:19:40.940
What is it about the fucking holidays? What is it about winter time that just makes the shit hit the fan? I hate it.

02:19:40.940 --> 02:19:44.180
So 2005 can go on and get the fuck out of here because we need a new year.

02:19:44.180 --> 02:19:51.900
I need a clean slate and I need time to get all my errands done so I don't have to work all freaking day. It's getting old.

02:19:51.900 --> 02:19:55.260
Alright. Anyway. That's that.

02:19:55.260 --> 02:19:59.260
Let's go to the chat room, shall we? Let's see what our chat room angst is tonight.

02:20:01.260 --> 02:20:06.260
Ron Chen would like to say F you to my job for keeping me late tonight for work and an F you to me

02:20:06.260 --> 02:20:13.260
for not taking my TV to the shop sooner since now I have no TV here.

02:20:13.260 --> 02:20:19.260
NintendoManiac64 says F you to more Mario Kart DS disconnectors.

02:20:19.260 --> 02:20:23.260
F you to a deer hitting our van and taking out half of its grilling, killing the left light.

02:20:23.260 --> 02:20:26.360
If you to Sony die already like your products do

02:20:27.220 --> 02:20:34.900
Dark Tatsuya says f you to ultra mix 3 again first rainbow flyer now gamland a couple when will PlayStation 2 fans finally get the love

02:20:36.260 --> 02:20:39.100
Soccerina says f you to requesting Sabrina from pop

02:20:39.540 --> 02:20:42.780
We could never get to play. I don't know if I have it good

02:20:43.100 --> 02:20:49.620
Maybe somewhere and f you to being nervous and not approaching girls final f you or fuck you almighty snow god

what and F you to my rainbow queen of the cosmos strap-on for being broken

Xander C says F you to well nothing I'm happy tonight very happy oh I know F you

02:21:48.180 --> 02:21:55.780
an F.U. to my dependence on sleep. And some F.U. is coming from Sharks Girl. F.U. to miles

02:21:55.780 --> 02:22:00.820
12 to 22 of the marathon because hot damn, not only was it hard, but they friggin' ran

02:22:00.820 --> 02:22:08.820
out of ice in Hawaii. 80 degrees and 10 miles is bad with no ice, but dammit, I did it.

02:22:08.820 --> 02:22:15.140
And that was our last F.U. tonight. And congratulations to Sharks Girl, by the way, for running that

02:22:15.140 --> 02:22:21.200
a marathon there. That's some good stuff. That's a long way to, I mean, God, I've done

02:22:21.200 --> 02:22:26.000
the six mile marathon and I thought that was bad, but 22, that's, oh, shit, that's a lot.

02:22:26.000 --> 02:22:31.400
All right, NintendoMateX64 also wants to add FU to Rainbow, I'm thinking Rainbow Road,

02:22:31.400 --> 02:22:36.520
in Mario Kart DS. Seriously, the first ten seconds to side the entire race. That's it,

02:22:36.520 --> 02:22:42.440
no more FUs. None. You're done. You're cut off. All of you. I want nothing but happiness

02:22:42.440 --> 02:22:47.040
from here on out. Except for the break. Yeah, except for the break, which will be emo. Which

02:22:47.040 --> 02:22:54.440
I'm very excited about. So we're getting down to the wire here. It's almost the end of the

02:22:54.440 --> 02:22:58.040
year. You know, the next time we do a live show is going to be 2006, I think, because

02:22:58.040 --> 02:23:01.320
we're not going to be here next week live. I think we're going to have a tape thingamabobber

02:23:01.320 --> 02:23:06.320
going on. What is, Dark Soccer's F'd Up Christmas, or what are we going to do next week? I don't

02:23:06.320 --> 02:23:08.800
remember. We're going to pre-tape some fucking stuff.

02:23:08.800 --> 02:23:12.440
Yeah, we need to do, uh...

02:23:12.440 --> 02:23:15.960
I think we should do the most fucked up Christmas songs we can find

02:23:15.960 --> 02:23:18.480
and, like, Christmas Speed.

02:23:18.480 --> 02:23:23.280
Oh, fuck Christmas Speed, seriously, I fucking hate that CD. Good, we should play it.

02:23:23.280 --> 02:23:26.360
Alright, so we'll do the Orange Laundry O Merry Fucking Christmas

02:23:26.360 --> 02:23:30.240
special. Yeah. Ugh, I don't have that to look forward to.

02:23:30.240 --> 02:23:34.320
Uh, and then now what? New Year's? We're gonna be here on New Year's Day, right? We'll be back on New Year's Day.

02:23:34.320 --> 02:23:38.200
Because nobody does anything on, like, New Year's Day. Unless, um,

02:23:38.200 --> 02:23:41.680
like still drunk. Let's see, here's the thing is that

02:23:41.680 --> 02:23:46.400
New Year's Day, guess what? Loki has that Monday off work.

02:23:46.400 --> 02:23:51.680
I have that Monday off work. You know what this means. We're going to kick off 2006

02:23:51.680 --> 02:23:55.800
and what could, would that be 169 or that would be 168?

02:23:55.800 --> 02:23:59.440
Well you know what we could do? Well I don't know that I should be making this

02:23:59.440 --> 02:24:03.120
suggestion on the air. Try me. Who cares? Who cares?

02:24:03.120 --> 02:24:06.720
Well I'm sure you both are invited to Julie's thing at her condo.

02:24:06.720 --> 02:24:12.720
But I was thinking I could bring my laptop, I might be able to record a little something something when the new year comes up.

02:24:12.720 --> 02:24:14.720
Because I'm making apple pie.

02:24:14.720 --> 02:24:18.720
Now I want to try some of that apple pie, that sounds good.

02:24:18.720 --> 02:24:22.720
You know I heard if you drink a whole thing of cough syrup that you'll hallucinate.

02:24:22.720 --> 02:24:24.720
We should try that live on here.

02:24:24.720 --> 02:24:26.720
Except I don't like cough syrup.

02:24:26.720 --> 02:24:27.720
You go first.

02:24:27.720 --> 02:24:30.720
My cough syrup will make you hallucinate, it's got Vicodin in it.

02:24:30.720 --> 02:24:32.720
Kids, don't follow our example please.

02:24:32.720 --> 02:24:37.560
We'll do something fun for the New Year's Day show.

02:24:37.560 --> 02:24:38.560
That'll be fun.

02:24:38.560 --> 02:24:39.560
More drinking.

02:24:39.560 --> 02:24:44.800
You know, DDR Freak is not doing their top DDR songs of the year or whatever, so maybe

02:24:44.800 --> 02:24:45.840
we'll have to pick up the slack.

02:24:45.840 --> 02:24:50.680
I need to talk to Iggy and see if we can steal that from DDR Freak, since they're apparently

02:24:50.680 --> 02:24:53.480
not doing one this year, because they would have done it by now, right?

02:24:53.480 --> 02:24:56.920
Because that poll ran, like, what, all of December?

02:24:56.920 --> 02:24:58.480
I'm going to have to talk.

02:24:58.480 --> 02:25:00.360
She's still doing the radio station.

02:25:00.360 --> 02:25:01.360
That's public news now.

02:25:01.360 --> 02:25:02.360
They posted that.

02:25:02.360 --> 02:25:09.140
forms, but she's still doing her radio, right? We'll talk to Iggy. We'll invite Iggy to get

02:25:09.140 --> 02:25:14.180
drunk with us, why not? That would be fun, I'll get drunk. Be good times.

02:25:14.180 --> 02:25:21.180
Uhm... let's see... episode 200 of orange launch radio shows up next year... op, that's

02:25:22.100 --> 02:25:26.700
gonna be crazy. Man, we've been doing this for a while.

02:25:26.700 --> 02:25:30.480
What's interesting is, you know what else this kind of marks 3 years, actually it'll

02:25:30.480 --> 02:25:33.600
be one more week but in this next week what Christmas Eve is this next week

02:25:33.600 --> 02:25:39.960
right this marks three years three years since DDR extreme came out in arcades

02:25:39.960 --> 02:25:44.720
that mix is officially three years old now and they say three years since DDR

02:25:44.720 --> 02:25:50.120
essentially died in the arcades so sad I mean they've had a good life at home but

02:25:50.120 --> 02:25:53.220
in the groove is out and whether you love it or hate it it's trying to pick

02:25:53.220 --> 02:25:56.880
up the slack that you know DDR kind of left behind in the arcades and then the

02:25:56.880 --> 02:26:02.920
home mix is a whole nother story we'll see I mean that maybe this will be the

02:26:02.920 --> 02:26:07.400
year but of course we said that last year yeah and what happened no nah nada

02:26:07.400 --> 02:26:10.720
although they did awesome did they have some good home mixes this year I mean

02:26:10.720 --> 02:26:14.040
they've been giving us the love with the home mix extreme 2 was good

02:26:14.040 --> 02:26:17.320
ultramix 3 was a little could have been better some of us were more arcade

02:26:17.320 --> 02:26:24.140
players than we were the problem with what's going on is that you know and

02:26:24.140 --> 02:26:28.940
To end the group's credit, whether you love it or hate it, what it's trying to do is it's

02:26:28.940 --> 02:26:33.320
trying to keep that arcade scene going, and that is how, let's face it, that is how we

02:26:33.320 --> 02:26:35.620
all met, the three of us here that do the show.

02:26:35.620 --> 02:26:39.900
We met around a DDR machine, because it used to be the kind of thing that would attract

02:26:39.900 --> 02:26:43.820
people to come together and play and have a good time together, and we'd all meet at

02:26:43.820 --> 02:26:47.820
the arcade at a certain night, we'd have a, what do we call it, Bomani Night or DDR Night,

02:26:47.820 --> 02:26:48.820
I don't remember what we called it.

02:26:48.820 --> 02:26:54.120
to do Wednesday's over Roseville Golf Land, and you know doing the arcade thing

02:26:54.120 --> 02:26:59.340
and that's kind of how we all met but now that's kind of gone. Although some

02:26:59.340 --> 02:27:03.020
arcades have enough of an in the groove community where that is kind of picked

02:27:03.020 --> 02:27:07.500
up to slack and I don't know I never really got into in the groove but maybe

02:27:07.500 --> 02:27:10.080
that's because maybe that's not necessarily in the grooves fault. This is

02:27:10.080 --> 02:27:12.340
something I was thinking about maybe it's not necessarily in the grooves

02:27:12.340 --> 02:27:16.500
fault, that I'm not into it, maybe it's the arcades in this town's fault because

02:27:16.500 --> 02:27:20.080
honestly the only arcade that has in the groove in this town kind of sucks for

02:27:20.080 --> 02:27:24.740
gatherings because I'm afraid I'm gonna get shot every time I go there so you

02:27:24.740 --> 02:27:28.080
know I think that's part of the bigger problem why we don't have that community

02:27:28.080 --> 02:27:31.880
at least in this town but I hear it's good doing well in other towns so who

02:27:31.880 --> 02:27:36.920
knows this is a good point for us to do the emo break now that I'm getting all

02:27:36.920 --> 02:27:40.760
emotional only go with the emo break remember kids down the road not across

02:27:40.760 --> 02:27:46.280
the street that's right all right so we're gonna do some emo and we'll be

02:27:46.280 --> 02:27:50.440
back with more Orange Lounge radio and what will you do you want to do some

02:27:50.440 --> 02:27:59.520
Ask Orange Lounge when we come back? Why not? I want to do some best ofs, although we have to save some of that for the podcast too, we'll do some best ofs as

02:27:59.520 --> 02:28:06.800
well in this break let's start it off with I think this song is pretty fucking

02:28:06.800 --> 02:28:09.320
depressing so we're gonna start off with a little bit of silhouette of my mind

02:28:09.320 --> 02:28:13.160
this is definitely an emo song so we'll be back with more as this is we did a

02:28:13.160 --> 02:28:15.380
happy break we're gonna do the depressing as fuck break and then we'll

02:28:15.380 --> 02:28:18.380
So enjoy this, and we'll be back with more Orange Launch Radio.

02:28:45.380 --> 02:28:50.380
I need you, I need you

02:29:15.380 --> 02:29:39.260
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight...

02:30:09.260 --> 02:30:11.260
Thanks for watching!

02:30:39.260 --> 02:30:51.260
I'm just so crazy, I'm considered a tree The thoughts they start to come to me

02:30:51.260 --> 02:30:55.260
All my pain, all my shame They actually make my way

02:30:55.260 --> 02:31:02.260
Just to go straight to the center of my heart

02:31:02.260 --> 02:31:08.260
I am frozen from the sound

02:31:11.260 --> 02:31:15.260
I am the best, I am real

02:31:15.260 --> 02:31:18.260
I am scary, I'm insane

02:31:18.260 --> 02:31:22.260
I'm a loner, I am cold

02:31:22.260 --> 02:31:25.760
I feel fresh when people come home

02:31:25.760 --> 02:31:29.260
I am nothing, I am dead

02:31:29.260 --> 02:31:32.760
I am scary, I'm in pain

02:31:32.760 --> 02:31:36.260
I'm in order, I am home

02:31:36.260 --> 02:31:41.260
I feel infected when people don't know

02:31:41.260 --> 02:32:08.260
And when I say I'm already gone Will I forget everything I've got so far?

02:35:08.260 --> 02:35:22.380
After this song, we'll be having a Let Them Move marathon.

02:35:22.380 --> 02:35:23.380
No!

02:35:23.380 --> 02:35:25.860
Just kidding.

02:35:25.860 --> 02:35:28.980
Orange Lounge Radio, crap-free Bhavani radio.

02:35:28.980 --> 02:35:31.780
Welcome back, boys and girls.

02:35:31.780 --> 02:35:36.100
I hope you enjoyed that break of sadness and tragicness.

02:35:36.100 --> 02:35:37.740
Deutz de Fatima.

02:35:37.740 --> 02:35:40.420
Ghosts, I am gothic and silhouette of my mind.

02:35:40.420 --> 02:35:45.100
That was a pretty emotional break, I think I had a movement in my bowels during that

02:35:45.100 --> 02:35:46.100
break.

02:35:46.100 --> 02:35:52.660
We're going to do a little bit of Ask Orange Lounge, but first actually we're going to

02:35:52.660 --> 02:35:55.700
go to our Skype line and open it up one more time there.

02:35:55.700 --> 02:36:01.460
It's www.orangeloungeradio.com and click on interact with us if you wish to call the show.

02:36:01.460 --> 02:36:03.020
And oh look, we're already getting a call.

02:36:03.020 --> 02:36:04.980
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

02:36:04.980 --> 02:36:06.980
Hey, hey, hey, it's Ron Shawn.

02:36:06.980 --> 02:36:09.860
Hello Ron-Chan, how are you my friend?

02:36:09.860 --> 02:36:11.660
I'm good, how are you guys?

02:36:11.660 --> 02:36:13.340
Good, what's on your mind?

02:36:13.340 --> 02:36:15.860
I have a couple of things I want to talk about real quick.

02:36:15.860 --> 02:36:19.860
First, I played Flow, the urban dance groove.

02:36:19.860 --> 02:36:24.180
Can you get yourself a little closer to your mic by the way, we're having a hard time hearing you.

02:36:24.180 --> 02:36:26.780
But you got to play Flow?

02:36:26.780 --> 02:36:30.980
Yeah, the urban dance groove. Much better, okay, how was that?

02:36:30.980 --> 02:36:33.980
It's Def Jam meets Dance Dance Revolution.

02:36:33.980 --> 02:36:35.980
Is this a good thing or a bad thing?

02:36:35.980 --> 02:36:41.980
I don't know. At first I felt kind of offended it was so bad, but yet it was just so funny.

02:36:41.980 --> 02:36:43.980
What kind of songs are in this game?

02:36:43.980 --> 02:36:51.980
There's a lot of old-school stuff like this, and there's a lot of new-school stuff I've never heard of.

02:36:51.980 --> 02:36:59.980
That's cool. How is the interface? How is the design of the game? Does it flow?

02:36:59.980 --> 02:37:03.980
Pretty much it does. The dance steps are a little bit too easy, though.

02:37:03.980 --> 02:37:07.980
Really? No really hard mode or anything?

02:37:07.980 --> 02:37:11.980
I think the levels are like DDR Mario Mix.

02:37:11.980 --> 02:37:15.980
Ooh, that's no good. Well, okay, but I guess if you're new to

02:37:15.980 --> 02:37:19.980
dance games, which maybe they're thinking the target audience for Flow is

02:37:19.980 --> 02:37:23.980
or is not the same group that plays DDR or whatever, I don't know,

02:37:23.980 --> 02:37:27.980
maybe that's just a warm-up. I don't know.

02:37:27.980 --> 02:37:31.980
I don't even know what UbiSoft is thinking

02:37:31.980 --> 02:37:37.500
because I remember one day I'm coming home and I see fliers for 187 ride or

02:37:37.500 --> 02:37:43.580
die and that game was really horrible. I think they're trying to get

02:37:43.580 --> 02:37:48.300
black people to play video games more or something like that. Do black people

02:37:48.300 --> 02:37:52.460
already play video games? I don't know. Yeah. But this is the French, what do they

02:37:52.460 --> 02:38:02.500
know but but what this is the French what do they know Wow okay a lot of

02:38:02.500 --> 02:38:06.900
people a lot of black people play video games I don't at least when I watch the

02:38:06.900 --> 02:38:11.460
video game video game Awards on Spike TV I would have thought only black people

02:38:11.460 --> 02:38:16.420
play games for the parts I watched I don't know if it was just me I tell you

02:38:16.420 --> 02:38:21.420
When I play DDR, I know I don't feel alone when I play.

02:38:21.420 --> 02:38:28.700
Anyway, okay, raised stuff aside, how does Flow stack up?

02:38:28.700 --> 02:38:33.020
Is it a worthy purchase for the music game fan, or is it a piece of crap?

02:38:33.020 --> 02:38:35.020
Wait till it drops to 19.

02:38:35.020 --> 02:38:36.980
Wait till it drops to 19, is that with...

02:38:36.980 --> 02:38:38.940
Oh no, because it's for PlayStation, right?

02:38:38.940 --> 02:38:39.940
Yeah.

02:38:39.940 --> 02:38:42.060
Okay, so that you can get the pads set away, okay.

02:38:42.060 --> 02:38:43.660
Wait for it to drop to 19.

02:38:43.660 --> 02:38:49.100
has a question can you crunk in the game only when you buy a 40 ounce to go with

02:38:49.100 --> 02:38:56.940
it nice all right anything else going on in the world around him a couple of

02:38:56.940 --> 02:39:01.420
things to answer Loki's question I've actually seen people drink a full bottle

02:39:01.420 --> 02:39:07.700
of pork syrup and get crazy at the raves did you hear that Loki you've seen

02:39:07.700 --> 02:39:11.220
people drink the bottle of cough syrup and get crazy at the raves just you know

02:39:11.220 --> 02:39:16.980
So listen to Rebel Testament, MC Chris.

02:39:16.980 --> 02:39:22.140
And this one is for you, Jamie.

02:39:22.140 --> 02:39:26.660
I was coming home off of work tonight and this kid was asking his mom about getting

02:39:26.660 --> 02:39:27.660
GTA.

02:39:27.660 --> 02:39:33.780
And she's like, no, you can't get it because you're too young for it, end of story.

02:39:33.780 --> 02:39:37.220
So he starts getting all mad and she's like, I'm going to ask my father to get it.

02:39:37.220 --> 02:39:40.700
She's like, well, you do that, you're still not going to get it, don't tell him not to.

02:39:40.700 --> 02:39:45.660
And then he goes, you know what, fuck you, I'm gonna get it anyway.

02:39:45.660 --> 02:39:48.440
The next part was priceless.

02:39:48.440 --> 02:39:51.980
She grabbed him by his baggy pants, like, you wanna say fuck you, you wanna say fuck

02:39:51.980 --> 02:39:52.980
you?

02:39:52.980 --> 02:39:56.180
She proceeded to beat his ass.

02:39:56.180 --> 02:39:57.180
That is beautiful.

02:39:57.180 --> 02:39:58.180
Good.

02:39:58.180 --> 02:40:00.140
That is a mama doing her job.

02:40:00.140 --> 02:40:05.420
Nothing good like a good old public humiliation to put a kid in his place.

02:40:05.420 --> 02:40:09.740
That is our mom of the week, we don't know a name for the mom?

02:40:09.740 --> 02:40:14.060
No, because I was just walking up and down the platform waiting for my train and I just

02:40:14.060 --> 02:40:15.460
started listening into the conversation.

02:40:15.460 --> 02:40:18.580
What does mom look like?

02:40:18.580 --> 02:40:20.340
Big mama, that's all you need to know.

02:40:20.340 --> 02:40:23.620
Big mama is our mom of the week, congratulations.

02:40:23.620 --> 02:40:24.900
Orange Andrey does mom of the week.

02:40:24.900 --> 02:40:29.540
You know, we should solicit these parent stories for like parents of the week.

02:40:29.540 --> 02:40:32.780
I think that would be a good feature maybe a little later on, like our parents of the

02:40:32.780 --> 02:40:33.780
week.

02:40:33.780 --> 02:40:34.780
We should do the yo mama of the week.

02:40:34.780 --> 02:40:37.980
Yo mama of the week, I like that.

02:40:37.980 --> 02:40:38.980
Awesome.

02:40:38.980 --> 02:40:47.100

that i will have a good one my friend, thank you for calling in

02:42:33.720 --> 02:42:37.300
bye

02:42:37.300 --> 02:42:38.300
alright

02:42:38.300 --> 02:42:39.580
that was fun

02:42:39.580 --> 02:42:42.520
we're going to get into Ask Orange Lounge in a little bit

02:42:42.520 --> 02:42:45.860
but first i'm going to log in the live channel so I can get that link here that

02:42:45.860 --> 02:42:48.440
DarkSakura posted there in her blog

02:42:48.440 --> 02:42:49.800
now what

02:42:49.800 --> 02:42:52.720
i gotta bring it up here though so that i can

02:42:52.720 --> 02:42:57.220
get the audio out now tell us again what this thing is all about here that we're going to watch

02:42:57.220 --> 02:43:02.740
the proper way to uh... eat sushi um... even directions as to how you enter the

02:43:02.740 --> 02:43:03.860
place

02:43:03.860 --> 02:43:06.940
to how you pour your beer for people

02:43:06.940 --> 02:43:08.820
and really a lot of that is just

02:43:08.820 --> 02:43:11.980
polite custom but it's really over blowing it

02:43:11.980 --> 02:43:15.360
it's really funny it totally makes fun of a lot of things that people do at sushi

02:43:15.360 --> 02:43:16.160
restaurants

02:43:16.160 --> 02:43:17.620
now it's not

02:43:17.620 --> 02:43:19.180
super long is it

02:43:19.180 --> 02:43:22.500
uh...

02:43:22.500 --> 02:43:25.000
We'll let it kind of start here, and if it's too long, then we'll just kind of...

02:43:25.000 --> 02:43:26.500
Might have to translate.

02:43:35.500 --> 02:43:37.500
The snack most commonly associated with Japan.

02:43:39.000 --> 02:43:41.500
A shop that sells sushi is called a sushi-a.

02:43:42.500 --> 02:43:45.000
Most Japanese eat at one every day.

02:43:48.500 --> 02:43:50.000
This is the entrance to a sushi-a.

02:43:50.000 --> 02:43:57.280
To pass through the short curtain called Noren, from the lower left corner of the third partition,

02:43:57.280 --> 02:44:02.120
find the spot 3.2 inches up at an angle of 48 degrees, place your hand like this and

02:44:02.120 --> 02:44:04.320
peel open.

02:44:04.320 --> 02:44:15.000
If you arrive less than 30 minutes before closing, ask, are you still open?

02:44:15.000 --> 02:44:22.800
On entering the premises, inside, two people, this is the number in your group, in a group

02:44:22.800 --> 02:44:28.840
of three, say, three people, in a group of four, say, okay, this is getting boring, when

02:44:28.840 --> 02:44:29.840
does this get good?

02:44:29.840 --> 02:44:35.160
It's just the whole thing is silly, you should always show a little guilt in your eyes if

02:44:35.160 --> 02:44:36.160
you're alone.

02:44:36.160 --> 02:44:40.880
Why would you be guilty if you're alone, what if you're on business or something?

02:44:40.880 --> 02:44:45.620
You know, we actually, we used to have a place here locally called Sushiya, so I think that's

02:44:45.620 --> 02:44:46.620
kind of funny though.

02:44:46.620 --> 02:44:49.620
I know, I'm sad that Sushiya is closed.

02:44:49.620 --> 02:44:52.180
You have to ask people to save my day.

02:44:52.180 --> 02:44:54.020
These two men look like they're going to get it on.

02:44:54.020 --> 02:44:55.020
No.

02:44:55.020 --> 02:44:56.020
They were hella flirting.

02:44:56.020 --> 02:44:57.020
Did you see that?

02:44:57.020 --> 02:44:58.020
Is this seat taken?

02:44:58.020 --> 02:45:03.020
I was supposed to do this in the chat room.

02:45:03.020 --> 02:45:05.020
Yeah, post the link in the chat room.

02:45:05.020 --> 02:45:06.020
It's hilarious.

02:45:06.020 --> 02:45:07.020
All right.

02:45:07.020 --> 02:45:08.020
That would be fun.

02:45:08.020 --> 02:45:10.020
I had Blanca that came in my town.

02:45:10.020 --> 02:45:13.020
I think someone sent them to Crevin and Rebelton.

02:45:40.020 --> 02:45:51.420
Let's ask Orange Lounge some stupid question, where will we find out this week on Orange

02:45:51.420 --> 02:45:53.420
Lounge Radio?

02:45:53.420 --> 02:46:09.900
Will we find out the best of 2005 or is the best yet to come in the next two weeks?

02:46:09.900 --> 02:46:16.900

02:46:22.060 --> 02:46:25.100
lounge radio jokes of 2005

02:46:47.940 --> 02:46:50.540
its size is relative

02:46:50.540 --> 02:46:54.140
it's not the size it's how you use it

02:46:54.140 --> 02:46:56.940

02:46:56.940 --> 02:47:01.540
well username nintendo maniac sixty four what about me do you think of

02:47:01.540 --> 02:47:04.180
the fact that you like nintendo i mean i don't know

02:47:04.180 --> 02:47:13.860
I think about all that fucking snaking that you do in Mario Kart DS.

02:47:13.860 --> 02:47:15.740
What language is the best other than English?

02:47:15.740 --> 02:47:16.740
I like this question.

02:47:16.740 --> 02:47:18.740
What language is the best other than English?

02:47:18.740 --> 02:47:19.740
Swahili.

02:47:19.740 --> 02:47:20.740
Loki?

02:47:20.740 --> 02:47:23.740
What's the best language?

02:47:23.740 --> 02:47:24.740
Other than English.

02:47:24.740 --> 02:47:25.740
Finnish.

02:47:25.740 --> 02:47:26.740
Other than English?

02:47:26.740 --> 02:47:27.740
Swedish.

02:47:27.740 --> 02:47:32.740
I would say Pig Latin.

02:47:32.740 --> 02:47:56.500
I am going to say something on record.

02:47:56.500 --> 02:47:59.100
I am taking flash next semester.

02:47:59.100 --> 02:48:06.620
She's going to make her own YTMNDs, I'm very excited about that.

02:48:06.620 --> 02:48:10.260
No I'm not, I'm going to make something special.

02:48:10.260 --> 02:48:13.340
Rini would like to know, is Akira Yamaoka gay?

02:48:13.340 --> 02:48:17.300
I hope not, because he's going to be my next husband.

02:48:17.300 --> 02:48:21.140
I saw this on some web forum, they were seriously debating if he was gay or not.

02:48:21.140 --> 02:48:25.820
I could swear that there's some interview out there, and Rice Princess pointed this

02:48:25.820 --> 02:48:30.420
out to me where he said that the first song he wrote or one of the songs he wrote on piano

02:48:30.420 --> 02:48:35.560
was about some girl. So I don't think he's gay and when I, you know, I am gay so I have

02:48:35.560 --> 02:48:39.000
gaydar. When I met him, cause I actually met him at E3 a couple years ago, he didn't strike

02:48:39.000 --> 02:48:44.000
me as gay. So, does it really matter though? He struck me as hot. Does it really matter

02:48:44.000 --> 02:48:48.400
if he's gay? Although the shirt he wore was kinda gay. I mean that was gay. But, but that's

02:48:48.400 --> 02:48:52.260
okay. I don't really care if he's gay or not. He just, he can make good music. But I know

02:48:52.260 --> 02:48:59.260
I know that's a big controversial thing on the internet right now. Who cares?

02:48:59.840 --> 02:49:02.860
What is the...oh, maybe that's why we got rid of this microphone. This is the buzzing

02:49:02.860 --> 02:49:07.620
microphone. We'll see. And what is the ultimate Bahmani song when listened to in moderation?

02:49:07.620 --> 02:49:14.620
Ooh, the ultimate Bahmani song. What do you think? The ultimate Bahmani song. Dark Sakura.

02:49:15.980 --> 02:49:19.260
My butt, the ass mix. Stop.

02:49:19.260 --> 02:49:26.260
i don't know

02:49:26.500 --> 02:49:29.300
still like uh...

02:49:29.300 --> 02:49:34.160
was that uh... moving on

02:49:34.160 --> 02:49:37.340
i have a real fun place for drifting away

02:49:37.340 --> 02:49:41.880
but also love love love and i'd just as you have to be in moderation i could

02:49:41.880 --> 02:49:44.100
just listen to some repeat all day long skulk

02:49:44.100 --> 02:49:51.100
from Ultimix 2. I just, I absolutely love that song. Love it!

02:49:51.860 --> 02:49:56.460
Sockarena wants to know, how does one know if he or she has an STD? More

02:49:56.460 --> 02:49:58.780
precisely, how do you get it checked?

02:49:59.780 --> 02:50:01.980
How does one know if he or she has an STD?

02:50:01.980 --> 02:50:03.940
Well, there are signs.

02:50:03.940 --> 02:50:07.740
There's lots and lots of different types of STDs, so the best way to find out

02:50:07.740 --> 02:50:09.260
really is to get tested.

02:50:09.260 --> 02:50:12.380
Get tested for STDs, and that's how you're going to know, because the doctor can shove

02:50:12.380 --> 02:50:13.620
something in your peehole

02:50:13.620 --> 02:50:18.900
and find out that way. Or, you know, there's tests. You can do blood tests and things.

02:50:18.900 --> 02:50:22.620
It just depends what STD you're looking for. I mean, crabs. Well, if your pubes itch a

02:50:22.620 --> 02:50:26.900
lot and there's little things bouncing. No, not really. You can't always see it. You probably

02:50:26.900 --> 02:50:33.900
have crabs. If something's wrong, go to the doctor. If you're itchy, use a cream. You

02:50:33.900 --> 02:50:38.140
can look up symptoms on a site like WebMD, or I can tell you from my background, I work

02:50:38.140 --> 02:50:42.340
for an insurance company. A lot of insurance companies have, well, oh wait, you're Canadian

02:50:42.340 --> 02:50:45.340
So I don't know what to tell you. Never mind. I forgot he's Canadian.

02:50:45.340 --> 02:50:48.340
So it's an entirely different ball game.

02:50:48.340 --> 02:50:51.340
I don't know if they have advice, nurses, some things like that in Canada,

02:50:51.340 --> 02:50:54.340
but if they have something like that, check it out.

02:50:54.340 --> 02:50:57.340
They can call on the phone, because they have that here.

02:50:57.340 --> 02:50:58.340
Insurance companies have that.

02:50:58.340 --> 02:51:00.340
Anything else you want to add, Loki?

02:51:00.340 --> 02:51:04.340
I just want to add that I drew a penis on Blanca's face,

02:51:04.340 --> 02:51:11.340
and this will be going to some random user's DS out there,

02:51:11.340 --> 02:51:18.220
I'm glad that a little kid's gonna see a penis on Blanca's face, and it's gonna have my credit

02:51:18.220 --> 02:51:19.220
to it.

02:51:19.220 --> 02:51:20.220
Good job.

02:51:20.220 --> 02:51:23.060
Xander C. wants to know, why aren't more people happy?

02:51:23.060 --> 02:51:26.500
I'm happy, so should everyone else be to happy.

02:51:26.500 --> 02:51:30.180
But if they think about geometry, they should want to kill people, like me, because I am

02:51:30.180 --> 02:51:31.180
the cool, right?

02:51:31.180 --> 02:51:34.660
Dude, what drugs are you on, seriously?

02:51:34.660 --> 02:51:38.220
No, I don't know.

02:51:38.220 --> 02:51:39.660
What kind of things make you happy?

02:51:39.660 --> 02:51:41.140
That's what I want to know.

02:51:41.140 --> 02:51:43.140
I'm changing this question a little bit. What makes you happy?

02:51:43.140 --> 02:51:45.140
Loki, what makes you happy?

02:51:45.140 --> 02:51:49.140
Um...

02:51:49.140 --> 02:51:51.140
Pleasure makes me happy.

02:51:51.140 --> 02:51:53.140
Like world pleasure makes you happy?

02:51:53.140 --> 02:51:55.140
Any pleasure makes me happy.

02:51:55.140 --> 02:51:57.140
Okay. Dark Sakura, what makes you happy?

02:51:57.140 --> 02:52:00.140
Um...

02:52:00.140 --> 02:52:02.140
A day off of work.

02:52:02.140 --> 02:52:04.140
I'm surprised you didn't say fire.

02:52:04.140 --> 02:52:07.140
Well, I like fire, but I can get that anytime I want it.

02:52:07.140 --> 02:52:09.140
You know, it's like sex.

02:52:09.140 --> 02:52:12.140
So, but I can't always get a day off of work when I want it.

02:52:12.140 --> 02:52:15.140
So, a day off of work just to do whatever I want to.

02:52:15.140 --> 02:52:17.140
You know what makes me happy?

02:52:17.140 --> 02:52:18.140
ABBA.

02:52:18.140 --> 02:52:21.140
ABBA makes me happy.

02:52:21.140 --> 02:52:22.140
ABBA makes everybody happy.

02:52:22.140 --> 02:52:28.140
You cannot help but be happy listening to ABBA.

02:52:28.140 --> 02:52:30.140
You didn't send this song to me, by the way. You didn't.

02:52:30.140 --> 02:52:34.140
Oh, I'm sorry.

02:52:34.140 --> 02:52:35.140
Moving on.

02:52:35.140 --> 02:52:36.140
Actually-

02:52:36.140 --> 02:52:36.140
What?

02:52:36.140 --> 02:52:37.140
I know it makes me happy.

02:52:37.140 --> 02:52:37.140
Oh.

02:52:37.140 --> 02:52:38.140
Dare.

02:52:38.140 --> 02:52:40.140
By the Gorillaz?

02:52:40.140 --> 02:52:41.140
Yeah.

02:52:41.140 --> 02:52:42.140
Or like Truth or Dare.

02:52:42.140 --> 02:52:45.140
Truth or Dare can make me happy when, you know, things go my way.

02:52:45.140 --> 02:52:46.140
I play Truth or Dare.

02:52:46.140 --> 02:52:47.140
Never mind.

02:52:47.140 --> 02:52:52.140
Because now with my new stereo, that song sounds completely fabulous in my car, and

02:52:52.140 --> 02:52:54.140
I get really hyper and drive fast.

02:52:54.140 --> 02:52:57.140
My car makes me happy, too.

02:52:57.140 --> 02:52:58.140
All right.

02:52:58.140 --> 02:52:59.140
Neodude Zero.

02:52:59.140 --> 02:53:02.140
Hey, did you hear about all the new games in development for the DS?

02:53:02.140 --> 02:53:07.140
One will raise your IQ as you play it, and the other teaches little girls how to orgasm.

02:53:07.140 --> 02:53:10.140
That one's not coming out, it's a conceptual game.

02:53:37.140 --> 02:53:41.140
I'm sorry not not vagina. It's not a statement. It's vagina

02:53:49.740 --> 02:53:51.740
Tasty

02:53:57.300 --> 02:53:59.300
What I don't know what you want me to say

02:54:01.300 --> 02:54:06.100
Thank you for bringing us to crashing the hall good job you broke our show good job

02:54:06.100 --> 02:54:11.100
So, since you broke our show, here's some more ABBA to make us happy again.

02:54:11.100 --> 02:54:16.100
This show is just getting weird.

02:54:16.100 --> 02:54:17.100
More ABBA.

02:54:17.100 --> 02:54:18.100
No, we need more cowbell.

02:54:18.100 --> 02:54:19.100
Please don't hear the reverb.

02:54:19.100 --> 02:54:21.100
So, please don't fear the reaper.

02:54:29.100 --> 02:54:38.100
You can dance, you can jive, having the time of your life.

02:54:38.100 --> 02:54:43.100
Okay, this show's gotten too gay. Sorry. Too gay.

02:54:43.100 --> 02:54:49.380
NintendoManiac64 says, can I erase someone in Mario Kart DS?

02:54:49.380 --> 02:54:54.060
I won't even snake, but I will powerslide insanely on turns, so fear.

02:54:54.060 --> 02:54:57.860
Unfortunately, they bring my Mario Kart DS.

02:54:57.860 --> 02:55:02.820
Yeah, I have a copy of Mario Kart DS in the other room, but I'm too busy playing Final

02:55:02.820 --> 02:55:03.820
Fantasy Advance 4.

02:55:03.820 --> 02:55:07.180
If I'm going to turn that fucking thing on, I'm beating Final Fantasy Advance 4, because

02:55:07.180 --> 02:55:09.220
I haven't beaten a video game in forever.

02:55:09.220 --> 02:55:11.220
I love Final Fantasy 4, too.

02:55:11.220 --> 02:55:12.220
It's so great.

02:55:12.220 --> 02:55:14.220
So great.

02:55:14.220 --> 02:55:16.220
Alright, but ask our chat room.

02:55:16.220 --> 02:55:19.220
Because maybe you'll find some people in there that would want to play you.

02:55:19.220 --> 02:55:22.220
Trade your friend code. We have a post in the forum now, right?

02:55:22.220 --> 02:55:27.220
We have a forum post over there on orange-trader.com where you can trade your friend codes, right?

02:55:27.220 --> 02:55:33.220
I actually did one specifically just for friend codes in all of the available games.

02:55:33.220 --> 02:55:39.220
Because we had one for Mario Kart DS, but since more and more games are going to come out that have friend code adding ability,

02:55:39.220 --> 02:55:41.220
I thought I'd just put it up there.

02:55:41.220 --> 02:55:42.220
Good deal.

02:55:42.220 --> 02:55:46.980
But be sure in that thread you say who you're adding, because in a lot of these games you

02:55:46.980 --> 02:55:51.580
have to have both people on the list, so make sure you say who you're adding.

02:55:51.580 --> 02:55:52.580
Alright.

02:55:52.580 --> 02:55:58.500
Oh yeah, there's those other websites too, DSmeet, and I want to say, one of our listeners,

02:55:58.500 --> 02:56:02.780
Big Red Pimp, had another one that's a popular DS meeting site, but you know, stick to the

02:56:02.780 --> 02:56:04.020
Orange Lounge Cult.

02:56:04.020 --> 02:56:08.100
Let's stick to our forums.

02:56:08.100 --> 02:56:12.860
Lucien had another question and the question was, Waterloo?

02:56:12.860 --> 02:56:21.980
I could do this all night you guys, I could do it all night long.

02:56:21.980 --> 02:56:27.180
ACM Buddy Paul wants to know, Sky are you the dancing queen?

02:56:27.180 --> 02:56:29.620
Actually I'm a terrible dancer actually.

02:56:29.620 --> 02:56:34.820
No, no, no, this is great because Rob Haddad does the choo-choo dance, that's the only

02:56:34.820 --> 02:56:37.340
way I can describe it.

02:56:37.340 --> 02:56:41.220
Actually, I think it was Eddie or somebody used to label me as, I would roll down the

02:56:41.220 --> 02:56:42.220
window when I dance.

02:56:42.220 --> 02:56:47.020
When I play DDR, I'm always rolling down the window, the choo-choo dance.

02:56:47.020 --> 02:56:52.660
I had never really seen you do the choo-choo dance until we went to asylum.

02:56:52.660 --> 02:56:59.820
And now keep in mind, this is the goth night at one of our local clubs, and they played

02:56:59.820 --> 02:57:00.820
Girls and Boys.

02:57:00.820 --> 02:57:03.580
I had to go back in there because it was a blur.

02:57:03.580 --> 02:57:06.380
And Rob gets out there and does a choo-choo dance, and I'm sitting there just watching

02:57:06.380 --> 02:57:12.000
and I'm drunk off my ass. Singing along while Rob's doing the choo-choo dance is funny.

02:57:12.000 --> 02:57:20.000
It's not so much the choo-choo dance as it is the white people dance. You know, somebody

02:57:20.000 --> 02:57:25.100
needs to teach me how to dance. See, I needed to be, I need to befriend, is this a movie

02:57:25.100 --> 02:57:31.720
somewhere maybe? I needed to befriend a black person with rhythm to teach me how to dance

02:57:31.720 --> 02:57:36.340
and like I enter a competition and win a lot of money. Is that White Men Can't Jump?

02:57:36.340 --> 02:57:43.040
I don't know no the only thing I remember about that movie is what's her

02:57:43.040 --> 02:57:49.800
name who decided that she was gonna be on Jeopardy that's the only thing about

02:57:49.800 --> 02:57:57.840
that movie I remember I don't know I don't remember any of that I actually

02:57:57.840 --> 02:58:01.760
ever saw that movie something I should probably share there I never even saw

02:58:01.760 --> 02:58:06.160
that movie some folks in the chat room are getting a little angsty because

02:58:06.160 --> 02:58:10.440
are playing so much ABBA, and they want to hear some disco prints from WeHawk Heart Katamari,

02:58:10.440 --> 02:58:12.560
I don't know, maybe like as alternate disco, so.

02:58:12.560 --> 02:58:17.560
That's all you get.

02:58:17.560 --> 02:58:26.560
That reminds me, me and Mike Katamari comes out to BSP this week for the Japanese.

02:58:26.560 --> 02:58:27.560
Which means I'll have it.

02:58:27.560 --> 02:58:28.560
Really?

02:58:28.560 --> 02:58:29.560
This week?

02:58:29.560 --> 02:58:30.560
Yeah, the 22nd.

02:58:30.560 --> 02:58:31.560
Sweet!

02:58:31.560 --> 02:58:32.560
That's awesome.

02:58:32.560 --> 02:58:37.560
No more ABBA requests. Stop ABBA- God damn, now I have all these requests for ABBA.

02:58:37.560 --> 02:58:40.560
The secret of me and my Katamari is that all the music is going to be done by me and my...

02:58:44.560 --> 02:58:46.560
They didn't do... Yeah, they did, didn't they?

02:58:46.560 --> 02:58:47.560
Yes, they did.

02:58:47.560 --> 02:58:51.560
I have a really cool song that they did, though, that wasn't in DDR. Maybe I'll put it in the cage match one day.

02:58:51.560 --> 02:58:53.560
If I haven't already.

02:58:53.560 --> 02:58:57.560
Was that, uh... Were they the ones that did LionEddie? No, no, that's SmileDK.

02:58:57.560 --> 02:58:59.560
No, they did, um, uh, Takeiro.

02:58:59.560 --> 02:59:01.560
Oh, yeah, I like that song.

02:59:01.560 --> 02:59:02.560
Sounds pretty.

02:59:02.560 --> 02:59:03.560
Good times.

02:59:03.560 --> 02:59:04.560
Good times.

02:59:04.560 --> 02:59:07.560
All right, well, we're going to close up the old Ask Orange Lounge, and you know what?

02:59:07.560 --> 02:59:09.600
We're getting towards the end of show.

02:59:09.600 --> 02:59:13.400
I know we still got about a few more minutes, but honestly, I feel that we're running out

02:59:13.400 --> 02:59:18.160
of steam here, and we have a phone call we have to make before we get into the podcast

02:59:18.160 --> 02:59:19.160
too.

02:59:19.160 --> 02:59:20.160
So we got to call it a show, guys.

02:59:20.160 --> 02:59:23.840
Thank you so much for tuning in and listening tonight, and I'm glad we didn't get the plug

02:59:23.840 --> 02:59:24.840
pulled on us.

02:59:24.840 --> 02:59:25.840
That's good.

02:59:25.840 --> 02:59:28.200
That's always good news to not get the plug pulled on us.

02:59:28.200 --> 02:59:30.200
Let's go around and get everybody's final thought.

02:59:30.200 --> 02:59:32.200
Loki, your final thought tonight?

02:59:32.200 --> 02:59:35.200
My final thought is, I just found the money rock.

02:59:35.200 --> 02:59:37.200
Good job.

02:59:37.200 --> 02:59:42.200
My final thought is, um, time.

02:59:42.200 --> 02:59:43.200
Need more.

02:59:43.200 --> 02:59:45.200
Darkstalker, your final thought?

02:59:45.200 --> 02:59:50.200
Um, reject false icons and someone give me a cure for the plague.

02:59:50.200 --> 02:59:51.200
Alright.

02:59:51.200 --> 02:59:56.200
That's gonna do it for tonight's episode of Orange Lounge Radio, the final word of the show, one word to sum it all up.

02:59:56.200 --> 03:00:00.400
Next week we will not be live but we will be doing something taped so if you're around

03:00:00.400 --> 03:00:01.400
tune in anyway.

03:00:01.400 --> 03:00:04.680
And of course stay tuned to the podcast we will have a new podcast one way or the other

03:00:04.680 --> 03:00:08.080
we have to figure out how we're going to tape that but we'll do that one way or the other

03:00:08.080 --> 03:00:09.080
and that's that.

03:00:09.080 --> 03:00:12.960
Then we'll see you back here on New Year's Day for the first orange laundry deal of 2006

03:00:12.960 --> 03:00:16.760
live and maybe some drinking going on we'll see what happens if you're good.

03:00:16.760 --> 03:00:20.200
And then episode 166 now we have a fun month ahead of us.

03:00:20.200 --> 03:00:21.200
We sure do.

03:00:21.200 --> 03:00:24.760
Alright the final word of the show one word to sum it all up.

03:00:24.760 --> 03:00:31.760

Holy night, holy night.

Holy sky, holy sprite.

03:01:31.760 --> 03:01:40.760
Once your frozen mother was shot

03:01:40.760 --> 03:01:49.760
Holy infant so tender and white

03:01:49.760 --> 03:01:59.760
Sleep in heavenly peace

03:01:59.760 --> 03:02:07.760
Sleep in heavenly peace

03:02:37.760 --> 03:02:47.760
Heav'nly, all singing, Hallelujah

03:02:47.760 --> 03:02:56.760
Christ the Son, send away all

03:02:56.760 --> 03:03:05.760
Christ the Savior with all

03:03:05.760 --> 03:03:24.760
Silent night, holy night, holy sky, holy sky.

03:03:24.760 --> 03:03:33.760
Roaring, rushing, mother and child.

03:03:33.760 --> 03:03:42.760
Holding in her soul, in the well of mine.

03:03:42.760 --> 03:04:09.760
Sleep in heavenly peace.

03:04:09.760 --> 03:04:11.760
