We are that podcast dedicated to video games and video gaming and all the news about games that don't suck

00:33.680 --> 00:38.280
But you know sometimes we have to talk about games that do suck just to tell you to avoid them

00:38.440 --> 00:41.720
My name is Rob Roberts. You might know me as Sky and I hope you got all the games

00:41.720 --> 00:43.720
You were hoping for this holiday season

00:44.320 --> 00:49.720
I know I got a couple so that makes me kind of happy and joining me as always is dark Sakura

00:50.240 --> 00:55.280
How you doing choke choke gasp? What did you did you get coal in your stocking this year again?

00:55.280 --> 00:57.280
Actually, I did get coal in my stocking.

00:57.280 --> 00:59.280
Awesome. That was from me.

00:59.280 --> 01:01.280
No, actually it was from Dan.

01:01.280 --> 01:04.280
It was in a little tin box that said lump of coal and it did have a lump of coal in it.

01:04.280 --> 01:06.280
Is that all he got you?

01:06.280 --> 01:10.280
No, I got the most romantic gift of Dawn of the Dead.

01:10.280 --> 01:12.280
Cool.

01:12.280 --> 01:16.280
And Serenity, of course, and a $500 car stereo and speakers.

01:16.280 --> 01:18.280
Nice.

01:18.280 --> 01:20.280
Nice. What did Dan get me for Christmas?

01:20.280 --> 01:22.280
A kick in the butt.

01:22.280 --> 01:25.360
Over there in the corner is the one and only Loki.

01:25.360 --> 01:29.000
Hello. How you doing? I'm okay. Alright.

01:29.000 --> 01:32.720
What did you do for the Christmas day or holiday or whatever you did?

01:32.720 --> 01:36.800
I hung out with family. That's pretty much it, yeah. Did you get anything? Get some loot?

01:36.800 --> 01:39.960
I got salami.

01:39.960 --> 01:44.760
What an awesome present! I don't think that's a game. I haven't heard of salami.

01:44.760 --> 01:49.320
I got three different types of salami. Peppered salami, which

01:49.320 --> 01:54.000
That stuff is really peppery. I mean, there's a ton of pepper on the outside of that thing.

01:54.000 --> 01:57.640
It gives you some serious heartburn if you eat too much of it.

01:57.640 --> 02:00.560
There was some Italian dry salami in there, and then some other stuff.

02:00.560 --> 02:03.160
It's the Swiss colony, the game!

02:03.160 --> 02:06.640
Help the Swiss miss! Save our supply of bee sticks! No one gets me games for Christmas

02:06.640 --> 02:07.960
because they know

02:07.960 --> 02:11.160
that I, you know, for one, I do

02:11.160 --> 02:14.600
work at a company that sells games, and I get tons of games anyways, and then I buy

02:14.600 --> 02:16.160
whatever I want.

02:16.160 --> 02:17.240
Good point.

02:17.240 --> 02:18.600
You know, makes it tough.

02:18.600 --> 02:19.920
Good point, good point.

02:19.920 --> 02:23.580
Alright, well of course happy holidays from us here at Orange Launch Radio to you

02:23.580 --> 02:27.080
guys and we are a day late this week because of the holidays. You know, give us

02:27.080 --> 02:27.920
a break.

02:27.920 --> 02:30.120
We're entitled to a vacation every once in a while,

02:30.120 --> 02:34.380
but we're here doing the show for you guys tonight. I was actually playing a game.

02:34.380 --> 02:38.520
Well, what a good segue into how was your gaming week? Dark Sakura, what did you

02:38.520 --> 02:41.800
play? Trivial Pursuits. I don't think...

02:41.800 --> 02:46.120
Was that on a console? No, we did Couples Trivial Pursuits.

02:46.120 --> 02:50.920
Me and Dan and his cousins and significant others and wives and things.

02:50.920 --> 02:54.040
This is not a board game podcast. There are some board game podcasts.

02:54.040 --> 02:58.960
Oh my god. Of which we are not one. So what kind of console or computer games are you playing?

02:58.960 --> 03:02.920
I started Papa Lacrosse, then Dan took the PSP away from me,

03:02.920 --> 03:09.600
which I was very upset with. Yeah, I found my game sitting on my computer

03:09.600 --> 03:11.600
desk and the PSP was gone.

03:11.600 --> 03:15.240
I was like, well great. So I've been playing a lot of Animal Crossing

03:15.920 --> 03:17.920
very cool

03:17.920 --> 03:21.320
And I finally got to see Need for Speed Underground on

03:22.380 --> 03:29.520
The 360 and actually I don't know why the hell Dan was talking about it looking slower because it really didn't it was gorgeous

03:29.520 --> 03:34.320
It makes the the Xbox 360 look like a PlayStation game

03:34.320 --> 03:40.000
grainy and pixely and the 360 version is pretty

03:40.000 --> 03:43.160
wait a minute you said it made the Xbox 360 version look like a PlayStation game

03:43.160 --> 03:44.160
you mean the Xbox version?

03:44.160 --> 03:45.160
the Xbox version looked like it

03:45.160 --> 03:46.440
I was confused for a minute

03:46.440 --> 03:47.440
most wanted yeah

03:47.440 --> 03:48.440
got it

03:48.440 --> 03:49.440
yeah most wanted sorry

03:49.440 --> 03:52.720
but it was a minute yeah it was really really sweet

03:52.720 --> 03:53.720
nice

03:53.720 --> 03:56.880
just the cop chases were awesome on it

03:56.880 --> 03:57.880
that's it?

03:57.880 --> 03:58.880
for now

03:58.880 --> 03:59.880
For now.

03:59.880 --> 04:00.880
Alright.

04:00.880 --> 04:01.880
Oh.

04:01.880 --> 04:02.880
Well, meow, miss thing.

04:02.880 --> 04:03.880
Alright.

04:03.880 --> 04:06.560
Somebody woke up on the wrong side of the sleigh.

04:06.560 --> 04:07.880
What's going on?

04:07.880 --> 04:08.880
Maybe under the sleigh.

04:08.880 --> 04:09.880
Alright.

04:09.880 --> 04:11.800
Loki, how was your gaming week?

04:11.800 --> 04:15.960
I just played a lot of multiplayer games, you know, typical work stuff.

04:15.960 --> 04:22.700
Grand Theft Auto Liberty City Stories, we actually have our six-man teams now, so it's

04:22.700 --> 04:24.800
really dense.

04:24.800 --> 04:31.000
There's tons of people running around in that game which is fun and it makes it really challenging.

04:31.000 --> 04:36.560
But I don't know, other people are getting better now so it's given me more of a challenge

04:36.560 --> 04:37.560
which is good.

04:37.560 --> 04:41.640
And then Call of Duty 2 we've been playing multiplayer during lunch which is really cool

04:41.640 --> 04:44.960
and I actually need to play the single player version of the game because it would be really

04:44.960 --> 04:45.960
nice.

04:45.960 --> 04:52.880
And then of course Animal Crossing Wild World we've been playing almost every day now.

04:52.880 --> 04:56.980
I don't know, it's a real easy game to pick up, play for like 10 minutes and put down.

04:56.980 --> 04:58.900
So that's why I kind of like it.

04:58.900 --> 05:04.100
And I don't have to play it every day like friggin' Nintendogs, which I might add I haven't

05:04.100 --> 05:07.500
played in a long time thinking about selling my last copy too.

05:07.500 --> 05:09.240
Oh wow.

05:09.240 --> 05:13.500
My puppies are probably flea-ridden and rabid by now.

05:13.500 --> 05:17.540
You know, I was worried that Animal Crossing was going to turn out the same way as Nintendogs.

05:17.540 --> 05:20.300
Now that the game's been out for a little while, what do you think?

05:20.300 --> 05:24.540
this something you're gonna still be playing six months from now or I'm sure

05:24.540 --> 05:27.620
I'll get tired of it after a while because six months there's a lot of good

05:27.620 --> 05:30.820
games they're gonna come out between them but it is gonna be a game they'll

05:30.820 --> 05:36.980
be playing for at least another couple months for sure I know I played the Game

05:36.980 --> 05:40.700
Cube one like all year just to get all the stuff like so they don't know that

05:40.700 --> 05:43.660
holidays are in this one because the Japanese version didn't have holidays

05:43.660 --> 05:49.380
um there's different holidays there's politically correct holidays so

05:49.380 --> 05:53.000
retarded. I love the festive candle that was in there which is the menorah and the

05:53.000 --> 06:02.040
festive tree with you know Christmas tree like but you know it it was never

06:02.040 --> 06:06.340
mind for me the squirrel said it all for me so I'll just let direct people to the

06:06.340 --> 06:11.320
recent for me the squirrel Christmas thing yeah that's how I feel about it

06:11.320 --> 06:16.260
all right check it out is that it anything else you want to add? That's pretty much it yeah.

06:16.260 --> 06:21.980
Um, my gaming week was um, you know pretty uneventful honestly because I didn't really get a whole lot of new stuff

06:21.980 --> 06:28.420
So I've been basically as promised last week Final Fantasy for Advance has been taking up a lot of my time

06:28.940 --> 06:30.940
and I

06:31.100 --> 06:34.460
Also was playing Animal Crossing for a little bit and checking out some other stuff

06:34.460 --> 06:39.440
So I decided I wanted to get into something new but there wasn't a whole lot of new games that were out that I wanted

06:39.580 --> 06:41.260
So I've been seeing

06:41.260 --> 06:46.260
commercials on TV and looking around the internet lately and I've heard a lot about this service game tap

06:46.260 --> 06:50.360
I don't know if you guys out there have heard of this game taps this thing where you can like

06:50.700 --> 06:55.820
Play I think something like 300 games is what they boast in their category 300 games on demand

06:55.820 --> 06:57.660
It's like an on-demand gaming service

06:57.660 --> 07:04.680
It's a very interesting business model because it's set up basically so that you pay a monthly service fee

07:04.680 --> 07:06.920
Which is right now. I think they're running a special where it's

07:06.920 --> 07:13.800
It's a two-week free trial and a $9.95 a month for 12 months, but I think normally it's about

07:13.800 --> 07:17.600
$14.95 a month is what they charge, so I'm not sure how long their special is running

07:17.600 --> 07:18.600
for.

07:18.600 --> 07:21.880
But what I think is interesting is that they say, hey, this is how much you'd pay for WOW

07:21.880 --> 07:27.180
or other comparable MMOs, so I thought that was kind of an interesting way to plug it.

07:27.180 --> 07:31.780
But of course the games that are accessible in the library are older games, but if you've

07:31.780 --> 07:35.880
been listening to the show for a while, you know that I'm really into these retro collections.

07:35.880 --> 07:40.480
I mean this year alone. I've talked about what one of the Midway arcade treasures that came out

07:40.480 --> 07:45.640
We got the Taito legends and the Tecmo collection all that stuff

07:45.640 --> 07:48.920
I bought the Namco collection, which was a horrible collection. But anyway

07:50.160 --> 07:56.800
Namco games are actually in the game tap game tap has you know contracts with or some type of agreement with many game publishing companies

07:57.260 --> 07:59.820
Such as I noticed Sega Activision Sierra

07:59.820 --> 08:05.860
and Namco, not that all the games from these companies are in the library, but a few other

08:05.860 --> 08:10.620
notable ones, like Pac-Man is in the library, Dig-Dugs, those type of things, but what's

08:10.620 --> 08:14.500
interesting also, not every game, you know, Nintendo, you're not going to see anything

08:14.500 --> 08:20.180
by Nintendo in here, but the GameTap library has all these different areas, you can either

08:20.180 --> 08:24.480
sort it by genre, you can sort it by the system, which I thought was very interesting, I did

08:24.480 --> 08:28.440
not realize when I first downloaded it that they actually had Dreamcast games in there,

08:28.440 --> 08:29.440
There's not very many.

08:29.440 --> 08:31.000
There's only three Dreamcast games available.

08:31.000 --> 08:35.120
I remember Hydro Thunder and Mr. Driller are both in there, but I thought it was very interesting

08:35.120 --> 08:40.160
that Dreamcast isn't that old, all things considered, so it was kind of neat to see

08:40.160 --> 08:41.400
that in there.

08:41.400 --> 08:49.680
They also have some relatively recent PC games in there, some of the Tomb Raider games, Tom

08:49.680 --> 08:57.240
Clancy games are in there, some of the Worms games, and just an interesting variety of

08:57.240 --> 09:01.960
stuff inside game tap so if you're a retro gaming fan or you're just the type

09:01.960 --> 09:05.860
that you know likes to check out old games you like to buy things that are in

09:05.860 --> 09:09.860
the bargain bin I think this is worth checking out I'll tell you what it's got

09:09.860 --> 09:14.160
a really slick interface to it I would actually say the game tap is sort of

09:14.160 --> 09:19.680
becoming like the iTunes of classic gaming and in a way like okay think

09:19.680 --> 09:23.160
about iTunes what is the light is you allows you to download music legally

09:23.160 --> 09:29.720
right but a lot of people just download their music from what what are the

09:29.720 --> 09:33.640
services out there now with a closed winmx they got what what's the

09:33.640 --> 09:37.600
underground stuff out there bit torrent or you know you could download songs off

09:37.600 --> 09:41.540
of there but yet you run the risk that you're gonna get songs that aren't a

09:41.540 --> 09:45.920
good quality get fakes you get things that are you know bogus and you know

09:45.920 --> 09:50.720
just the general fact that you know you're stealing shit so um what's

09:50.720 --> 09:53.780
What's interesting about GameTap is it's almost like that, but now we're talking about like

09:53.780 --> 09:55.840
abandonware and emulation.

09:55.840 --> 09:59.160
And I think this is the first time, and I would say it's kind of taken the industry

09:59.160 --> 10:03.260
long enough, with the exception of these retro packs and things, this is really the first

10:03.260 --> 10:10.000
time that I can recall seeing like a PC kind of trying to legalize the abandonware and

10:10.000 --> 10:13.560
emulation scene, which could be bad news for those people, because as this gets more and

10:13.560 --> 10:16.920
more prevalent, you know, I think they're going to go after those types of sites, the

10:16.920 --> 10:17.920
ones that they haven't already.

10:17.920 --> 10:24.240
But you know, $9.95 a month, not too shabby, it's a pretty reasonable price when you consider

10:24.240 --> 10:27.240
that you're usually paying that much for one MMO.

10:27.240 --> 10:33.440
So Interface is very sleek, games download pretty quickly unless you're playing a newer

10:33.440 --> 10:39.580
game that was originally on CD, like I played Mr. Driller on Dreamcast, it took 11 minutes

10:39.580 --> 10:43.720
to download, but you can play other games in the background, like while that's downloading

10:43.720 --> 10:47.880
I can play something on Atari 2600, and what I also thought was very interesting

10:47.880 --> 10:52.000
about GameTap and this is something I don't think a lot of people are mentioning is that

10:52.000 --> 10:58.400
GameTap is owned by Turner Broadcasting, which you know, owns a lot of television stations,

10:58.400 --> 11:02.600
and so they produce their own programming for this GameTap service.

11:02.600 --> 11:06.840
One of the things they push is this MediaPlex that has their own little channels, like they

11:06.840 --> 11:11.720
have like a reality show to pick the next GJ as they're calling it, like a game jockey

11:11.720 --> 11:15.340
or whatever, you know, cheesy but okay, whatever.

11:15.340 --> 11:19.100
And then they also have these little commercials that, you know, play while you're waiting

11:19.100 --> 11:26.720
to download the games, and they kind of show like, you know, like a Dig Dug short funny

11:26.720 --> 11:31.840
thing or Pac-Man or whatever, what was it, like Galaxian or there's other stuff in there.

11:31.840 --> 11:36.080
So what I thought was kind of neat about that is that a lot of the stuff I was seeing on

11:36.080 --> 11:41.860
GameTap is probably better than anything I've seen on G4TV the past year.

11:41.860 --> 11:45.540
So that kind of makes me go, hmm, very interesting.

11:45.540 --> 11:50.460
And you know, if there's anybody from GameTap out there listening, by chance, seriously,

11:50.460 --> 11:53.760
I'm pretty impressed with what you guys are doing programming-wise.

11:53.760 --> 11:56.060
And I'm like, why don't you guys start a station?

11:56.060 --> 11:59.300
Because I don't know if you guys are aware right now, but gamers are pretty much being

11:59.300 --> 12:04.180
robbed very slowly of the only representation we pretty much had on TV, which was G4, which,

12:04.180 --> 12:09.140
you know, bought tech TV and then now is, you know, replacing their shows like Filter

12:09.140 --> 12:13.500
G4TV.com with repeats of the man show and repeats of Fastlane.

12:13.500 --> 12:17.180
Okay people, no one watched Fastlane the first time for a reason.

12:17.180 --> 12:22.100
Okay? I want to know why they're showing Star Trek The Next Generation.

12:22.100 --> 12:25.340
Yeah, and now that too, it's like, WTF people.

12:25.340 --> 12:28.820
Star Trek The Next Generation, they've become Spike now?

12:28.820 --> 12:32.380
They're Spike for kids is what they're turning into. Anyway, this is about GameTap.

12:32.380 --> 12:36.260
I'm pretty impressed because it seems like, you know what, the people at GameTap

12:36.260 --> 12:39.260
seem to know what they're doing, unlike the folks at G4.

12:39.260 --> 12:43.660
So, if this is promising that they might

12:43.660 --> 12:47.300
try to do a station at, I think it will be really neat to see.

12:47.300 --> 12:51.660
So, as a gamer who feels underrepresented on the cable box right

12:51.660 --> 12:52.940
now, I think that's very interesting.

12:52.940 --> 12:56.540
And GameTap, you know, that would be a good name for a station anyway.

12:56.540 --> 13:00.180
Things to consider. Anyway, so the services, so that's cool, I like the media,

13:00.180 --> 13:00.860
that's a big plus.

13:00.860 --> 13:05.300
The service itself, you know, it does have some issues now, I had some graphical

13:05.300 --> 13:05.860
glitches,

13:05.860 --> 13:10.660
I have had the system lock up completely when some of the video tries to download.

13:10.660 --> 13:15.260
I don't know if that's my system specifically or if that's, you know, maybe more people are going to have problems with that.

13:15.260 --> 13:16.160
I don't know.

13:16.160 --> 13:21.860
But anyway, I do recommend GameTap, especially if you're a fan of, like, retro gaming things.

13:21.860 --> 13:27.360
You know, it's a two-week free trial. Check it out. Why not? You know, it's pretty cool.

13:27.360 --> 13:31.260
I think it's one of those things that's going to get better with time, because it's still in the early stages,

13:31.260 --> 13:34.660
and I know they recently signed deals with Capcom and some other publishers as well,

13:34.660 --> 13:38.500
And I think I read some of they want to grow to like a thousand games by this time in a year

13:38.500 --> 13:43.540
So I think it's gonna be very interesting to see where the service is at a year from now to see if it really does

13:43.540 --> 13:49.260
Get the support from the gaming community. I think you know what you could pay $19.95 for one of these retro collections

13:49.260 --> 13:54.140
Or you go for this. I think this is worth checking out and so I recommend game tap

13:54.140 --> 13:58.060
I you guys got to see it very briefly. I showed it to you guys real quick. What do you think?

13:58.060 --> 14:02.340
What do you think of this idea it has potential? Mm-hmm definitely has potential

14:02.340 --> 14:06.700
That's about all I can and so I get to play it and see what the gameplay is like. Mm-hmm

14:07.540 --> 14:13.820
Loki it looked good. I like it. I mean even something really cool if it was like on a

14:14.700 --> 14:19.580
Set top, you know console thing like if they could come out with some sort of really bare-bones

14:20.300 --> 14:25.020
Wireless controller thing kind of like the Phantom, you know, they were talking about doing you know all streaming

14:26.020 --> 14:31.640
That model could works if the fan sucks, but I don't know it looks good though

14:31.640 --> 14:38.580
I mean, it's definitely something worth checking out especially if you've got definitely wanted some controllers or something for your PC

14:38.580 --> 14:43.640
You know why going? Yeah, that's my other complaint, but that's not game taps fault is that my controller sucks

14:43.640 --> 14:46.180
So it's not I mean it is neat the game tab

14:46.180 --> 14:49.400
You know picked it right up and it knew what kind of controller I had but it sucks

14:49.400 --> 14:52.200
I need to get something better if I want to use controller, but still though

14:52.200 --> 14:55.840
I mean it looks good and I like the way the interface was that was really cool

14:55.840 --> 15:00.160
Actually now as somebody who often reports on this program about what's going on underground

15:00.160 --> 15:01.360
ground

15:01.360 --> 15:04.280
which you see would you actually papers on the like a tap

15:04.280 --> 15:08.980
uh... no because i don't have enough time to actually sit there and go play a

15:08.980 --> 15:10.540
lot of games online

15:10.540 --> 15:13.760
let alone pay ninety and no nine ninety five a month for something

15:13.760 --> 15:15.180
mean look i have

15:15.180 --> 15:18.880
i some still subscribe to file fancy eleven god knows why haven't played the

15:18.880 --> 15:20.360
game like six months

15:20.360 --> 15:22.140
but uh...

15:22.140 --> 15:25.620
sure i don't know i guess you know i think that's going to be most people

15:25.620 --> 15:28.240
sticking point we came to have is that there's not a lot of new stuff on there

15:28.240 --> 15:32.040
So if you want to play the new, cutting-edge stuff, GameTap's probably not for you.

15:32.040 --> 15:35.840
Okay, GameTap's more of like a library, but, you know, it shows potential, and maybe, you

15:35.840 --> 15:38.920
know what, who knows, companies might pick up on this model.

15:38.920 --> 15:41.760
The other thing I wanted to say, before we get into the news, I'm sorry to spend so much

15:41.760 --> 15:45.480
time on this, but it, because this really made me think about this, the whole GameTap

15:45.480 --> 15:49.440
thing is, it really made me think about, I bet you anything, this is how Nintendo Revolution's

15:49.440 --> 15:50.440
going to be set up.

15:50.440 --> 15:53.580
I bet you Nintendo Revolution, with its old Nintendo Classics, because when I started

15:53.580 --> 15:56.960
not seeing the Nintendo games in GameTap, I thought, you know what, Nintendo Revolution,

15:56.960 --> 16:03.320
I bet you this is going to be the same model. Choose your console, choose 9.95 a month, 14.95 a month, whatever they're going to charge,

16:03.320 --> 16:07.800
and then the unlimited play of the old Nintendo games. I bet you anything, Revolution is going to have the same business model.

16:07.800 --> 16:14.960
Or they could just do something very similar to Xbox Live, where you have the silver, which doesn't allow you to play the old games or whatever,

16:14.960 --> 16:20.240
and then you can pay the gold, which is 9.95, you get all the old games from all the systems,

16:20.240 --> 16:24.200
plus whatever other crap that they throw on there as well for download.

16:24.200 --> 16:26.520
It would be interesting to see what happens.

16:26.520 --> 16:28.520
Anyway, let's get into some news for tonight.

16:28.520 --> 16:33.640
I'm going to start it off and talk about, why not, let's talk about the Xbox 360.

16:33.640 --> 16:37.600
Kind of been the talk of the last two months.

16:37.600 --> 16:41.680
Microsoft of course has been shipping out a little more and more now and they're saying

16:41.680 --> 16:45.340
that they're going to start doing these weekly shipments, but you know, a lot of people still

16:45.340 --> 16:46.760
say, you know, don't hold your breath.

16:46.760 --> 16:49.560
If you didn't pre-order, you're still not getting one of these until March if you're

16:49.560 --> 16:53.220
an EB Games or GameStop shopper.

16:53.220 --> 16:58.460
magazine newspaper, San Jose Mercury News, actually said Microsoft is disappointed that

16:58.460 --> 17:01.620
it can't get more units of the Xbox 360 into the market.

17:01.620 --> 17:04.860
So Microsoft has that regret there.

17:04.860 --> 17:08.100
So I don't know what that's about because you think they'd do something about it.

17:08.100 --> 17:12.500
But anyway, what's interesting is that the reporter from the San Jose Mercury News, Dean

17:12.500 --> 17:17.940
Takahashi, also said in his personal blog, various folks tell me that the shortage isn't

17:17.940 --> 17:19.820
a problem with chip yields.

17:19.820 --> 17:23.020
I think it's more of a systems issue when the boxes come together.

17:23.020 --> 17:27.740
working on getting more units out so this guy saying that maybe it's not the

17:27.740 --> 17:31.340
chip shortage the fact they just can't package them fast enough which is a

17:31.340 --> 17:35.460
little disappointing if that's really it because you think they would have gotten

17:35.460 --> 17:38.420
the resources. I think they might be afraid that they're running into these

17:38.420 --> 17:42.780
glitches that people are running into now with the overheating stuff they're

17:42.780 --> 17:47.100
trying to get more working units that don't have these same problems that

17:47.100 --> 17:51.460
could be it and so you know comes down a quality control problem or something

17:51.460 --> 17:54.820
I don't know who cares either way they're not getting them to source

17:54.820 --> 17:59.000
fact I did see it looks like the local GameStop they got some more in because I

17:59.000 --> 17:59.420
saw

17:59.420 --> 18:05.340
someone very quietly moving one of the premium consoles from the back room into

18:05.340 --> 18:09.660
you know under the counter I was like ahhh interesting okay

18:09.660 --> 18:13.500
well now now that's just one particular story I got from the internet now

18:13.500 --> 18:17.220
Dark Soccer you have another story about the shipment of Xbox 360s

18:17.220 --> 18:22.540
Well, there's a bit of word out because they were checking about Microsoft UK as far as

18:22.540 --> 18:26.140
if they were going to get their shipments out and they said that they're actually on

18:26.140 --> 18:36.700
track to meet their 90-day forecast that they had out of 2.75 to 3 million units to go out.

18:36.700 --> 18:42.520
As far as the US shipment is concerned, there's a quote that I found that says they're working

18:42.520 --> 18:47.240
around the clock to deliver as many Xbox 360 consoles as humanly possible.

18:47.240 --> 18:53.780
There is, though, a pretty rampant disappointment throughout Microsoft US about how low the

18:53.780 --> 18:55.200
shipments have been.

18:55.200 --> 18:58.480
I still think it's purposeful, but...

18:58.480 --> 19:00.320
We'll see, we'll see.

19:00.320 --> 19:02.600
Now, Loki, you have a story also...

19:02.600 --> 19:04.960
Actually, there's one more thing about that.

19:04.960 --> 19:12.640
Actually it was asked about that and said that they, that there was any, Microsoft's

19:12.640 --> 19:17.440
competitors are actually even thinking that they're legitimate, that the shortage is legitimate.

19:17.440 --> 19:21.120
The quote from Sony's Phil Harrison says that, I don't believe that for a second.

19:21.120 --> 19:24.640
I think that it's clear that they're making every unit that they can, whether that is

19:24.640 --> 19:27.440
enough for demand or that they can't make enough is a question you'll have to put to

19:27.440 --> 19:28.440
Microsoft.

19:28.440 --> 19:30.080
But it's definitely not done on purpose.

19:30.080 --> 19:33.040
That's an interesting little support from the competition there.

19:33.040 --> 19:34.040
Yeah.

19:34.040 --> 19:38.280
Loki, you have some news about relating to the Xbox Live Diamond Account now?

19:38.280 --> 19:40.160
There's silver, gold, and diamond now?

19:40.160 --> 19:41.160
What the hell is this?

19:41.160 --> 19:42.160
Well, it's a diamond card.

19:42.160 --> 19:44.820
It's not necessarily anything that you have to pay for.

19:44.820 --> 19:50.560
If you have an Xbox Live Gold membership, you can actually subscribe using your gamertag

19:50.560 --> 19:52.560
to this diamond card.

19:52.560 --> 19:56.520
It's basically this little card that you get that has this cool little graphics on there

19:56.520 --> 20:02.200
plus your gamertag, and they have a bunch of affiliates with Microsoft that are offering

20:02.200 --> 20:03.200
discounts for it.

20:03.200 --> 20:05.520
It's kind of like one of those discount cards that you get.

20:05.520 --> 20:15.940
So basically if you go to Xbox, I believe it's xboxlivediamondcard.com, let me see here

20:15.940 --> 20:20.600
real quick, it's xboxlivediamond.com, that's what it was.

20:20.600 --> 20:25.200
You go there, you put your gamer tag in, and you sign up and they'll basically ship it

20:25.200 --> 20:28.060
to your address that you have signed up with.

20:28.060 --> 20:31.340
What if you have an Xbox regular live account?

20:31.340 --> 20:32.340
No dice?

20:32.340 --> 20:41.620
it nope ah sucks give it the times folks anyways no but um some of the um actual affiliates that

20:41.620 --> 20:47.460
they have right now they're talking about like mcdonald's um i saw what was it like carls jr

20:47.460 --> 20:53.060
burger king type stuff on there um i know as well just what a gamer needs fast food yeah

20:53.060 --> 20:59.060
yeah that's exactly how about how about getting some fresh choice discounts in there hey yo hey

20:59.060 --> 21:03.060
No, no, no. They've got like, for example, and this is actually on the website, they

21:03.060 --> 21:08.540
have a Hollywood video where you rent a movie or a video game and get the second rental

21:08.540 --> 21:15.540
free. Sam Goody, 10% off DVDs and CDs. Quiznos, you know, buy a sandwich, get the second one

21:15.540 --> 21:25.540
free. 50% off of Cambridge Soundworks speakers. 20% off of Etnies shoes. This is a big, you

21:25.540 --> 21:26.540
know, list of stuff.

21:26.540 --> 21:33.340
I'm going over to Dark Soccer because maybe she'll back me up on this.

21:33.340 --> 21:39.900
Is it just me or could Xbox be the moralist here and offer discounts to like 24 Hour Fitness?

21:39.900 --> 21:47.020
I wish they would but you know they're going to cater to, sorry the typical gamer, I hate

21:47.020 --> 21:54.260
to say it but I don't know many average gamers who are into fitness and health.

21:54.260 --> 21:58.720
I mean, I know lots who are, yeah, but, you know, if you think about your average,

21:58.720 --> 22:04.520
say your college, the stereotype, like the college frat boy, no.

22:05.400 --> 22:10.660
And on top of that, honestly, promoting a lazy lifestyle helps their business.

22:10.660 --> 22:19.660
which has Wi-Fi for the DS. McDonald's or Fresh Choice? I make my point.

22:19.660 --> 22:21.660
Fresh Choice is only in California.

22:21.660 --> 22:28.660
Oops, sorry, I made a regional joke. Jamba Juice? Is that nationwide? That's borderline healthy.

22:28.660 --> 22:31.660
They don't have Jamba Juice in my part of Alabama.

22:31.660 --> 22:33.660
Ah, forget it then.

22:33.660 --> 22:35.660
So you know what they need to have?

22:35.660 --> 22:36.660
What?

22:36.660 --> 22:41.560
It's like they have the live fitness bikes that you can watch TV or listen to your CD

22:41.560 --> 22:42.560
player on.

22:42.560 --> 22:48.900
They need to have one with like an Xbox 360 hooked up to it, so it will shut down if you

22:48.900 --> 22:49.900
stop pedaling.

22:49.900 --> 22:51.220
There you go.

22:51.220 --> 22:54.700
Or if you pedal too fast and it gets too hot.

22:54.700 --> 22:55.700
Lame.

22:55.700 --> 23:01.660
All right, Loki, speaking of Xbox 360, what the hell is going on with Dead or Alive 4?

23:01.660 --> 23:06.580
It's actually been delayed again, but this time only a couple more days.

23:06.580 --> 23:11.380
It's actually, the people that have been reviewing the final copy, which is supposedly going

23:11.380 --> 23:17.780
gold here pretty soon, actually gave it 100%, just a really good game.

23:17.780 --> 23:23.180
They're basically working on the online, make sure it's very balanced, and they just wanna

23:23.180 --> 23:25.900
make sure the game's good before it goes out.

23:25.900 --> 23:30.520
And supposedly now the new date is January 2nd, it's gonna be the new ship date on it.

23:30.520 --> 23:35.580
So expect it in stores around the 3rd, hopefully it won't get pushed back again but I haven't

23:35.580 --> 23:39.080
heard anything yet on it and they would have probably already given us news already if

23:39.080 --> 23:42.860
that were the case. So some gamers out there want to hold on to those gift cards? Absolutely.

23:42.860 --> 23:47.880
Yeah definitely. And to be honest, there is nothing coming out in the next two weeks other

23:47.880 --> 23:52.780
than Dead or Alive. Okay, I mean let's put it this way. Last week for games, there was

23:52.780 --> 23:57.500
two games that came out. There was King Kong on the PSP and Pocket Dogs on the Game Boy

23:57.500 --> 24:03.100
Advance. That is it. Oh god, we covered that in a previous show. That is it. Nothing, nada.

24:03.100 --> 24:07.140
And now we're just talking about Dead or Alive 4 for this next week.

24:07.140 --> 24:11.420
Only game coming out on the consoles, and then the next week there's a couple games,

24:11.420 --> 24:12.420
and then that's it.

24:12.420 --> 24:14.980
Then your next big game is going to be 25 to Life.

24:14.980 --> 24:18.200
And then, Jamie, you were saying that UK's lineup looks pretty similar.

24:18.200 --> 24:20.180
It's pretty much a ghost town for a little while.

24:20.180 --> 24:21.180
Yeah.

24:21.180 --> 24:25.020
The softer, the next big, you know, sell period comes up.

24:25.020 --> 24:26.020
Yeah.

24:26.020 --> 24:27.020
All right.

24:27.020 --> 24:28.020
Interesting.

24:28.020 --> 24:29.620
All right, let's do some console balance here.

24:29.620 --> 24:30.860
We've talked enough about Xbox 360.

24:30.860 --> 24:32.300
Let's talk a little bit about PS3.

24:32.300 --> 24:34.300
I know Dark Sakura has a story about

24:34.420 --> 24:37.020
Finally, we know like a game that might be coming to ps3

24:39.060 --> 24:45.820
Actually unreal tournament 2007 is coming out for the PlayStation 3 and it's set in spring 2006 I

24:46.620 --> 24:52.660
Think the date is almost more interesting than the announcement of the game itself. That's great. Yeah, it's actually pretty cool

24:52.660 --> 24:58.940
I mean, I don't think it's too surprising that it's gonna be on PlayStation 3. Mm-hmm, but just the I

24:58.940 --> 25:03.100
I mean honestly, to be out so quickly?

25:03.100 --> 25:06.460
That's surprising to me, but actually I'm not so surprised

25:06.460 --> 25:10.500
or I mean I am a little bit surprised by the fact that it's coming on PS3 because

25:10.500 --> 25:14.780
when I think about Unreal Tournament previous games, I think of Xbox

25:14.780 --> 25:18.340
but maybe that's just because that's where I owned Unreal before I sold it back

25:18.340 --> 25:19.340
finally because I was bored of it

25:19.340 --> 25:23.380
but, you know, I kind of always thought of it as an Xbox title, but yeah

25:23.380 --> 25:28.740
Well, I have a feeling that we're gonna see it on Xbox 360

25:28.740 --> 25:36.260
Mmm, but just that it's gonna be a I'm just sort of the whole announcement together. Right? It's sort of like the whoa

25:37.200 --> 25:43.120
They could do a grand theft auto San Andreas where they put it out on one console exclusively for

25:44.200 --> 25:48.560
You know XML months nine months or whatever and then they bring it out in the other systems later

25:50.480 --> 25:55.440
Now I have a story about Nintendo revolution and that actually has to do a Zelda Twilight Princess is that

25:56.320 --> 25:57.600
in

25:57.600 --> 26:03.220
In a Nintendo magazine released in Europe, it's actually NGC and their January 2006 issue,

26:03.220 --> 26:08.080
they're saying that Twilight Princess is going to be using the Revolution controller.

26:08.080 --> 26:11.840
There's a quote here, our development team has decided to take extra time to add some

26:11.840 --> 26:13.880
incredible elements.

26:13.880 --> 26:19.960
There were elements that Miyamoto said were simply far too good to leave out.

26:19.960 --> 26:23.080
We kind of heard about the delays the first time being the fact that they're going to

26:23.080 --> 26:27.600
add something revolution special here so it looks like the controller is a big

26:27.600 --> 26:28.640
part of that so kind of

26:28.640 --> 26:32.680
pieces together with what we heard about the delay the first time so that whole

26:32.680 --> 26:36.040
innovative controller thing will somehow come into play with

26:36.040 --> 26:39.360
the revolution. Interesting. Yeah.

26:39.360 --> 26:42.520
That's really all I got on the revolution. There's not a whole lot of other news. You got something?

26:42.520 --> 26:46.520
I got something real quick on the PlayStation 3 which I thought was very interesting.

26:46.520 --> 26:49.360
Everyone's wondering if the Blu-ray thing they were talking about region coding

26:49.360 --> 26:51.320
whether they're actually just going to get rid of it

26:51.320 --> 26:55.280
or what's going on. Well at least for the U.S. and

26:55.280 --> 26:58.600
Japanese there's not going to be a real big issue because the

26:58.600 --> 27:02.600
region coding for the blu-ray has been announced and Japan and U.S.

27:02.600 --> 27:05.880
are in the same region code which should be very interesting.

27:05.880 --> 27:08.880
Unfortunately Europe, they're gonna be

27:08.880 --> 27:13.480
getting the bone again as they put in this article here because they're in a

27:13.480 --> 27:14.320
different region.

27:14.320 --> 27:18.080
Well that's not a surprise because their TVs are a different format.

27:18.080 --> 27:21.320
With the high def TVs, I would have figured they're all the same format now.

27:21.320 --> 27:24.800
Yeah, but how many people really have high def?

27:24.800 --> 27:29.080
Alright, anyway, Loki, you had a story now about two of the systems here,

27:29.080 --> 27:31.160
PlayStation 3 versus

27:31.160 --> 27:33.880
Xbox 360 and what Microsoft's kinda...

27:33.880 --> 27:37.280
The whole thing with the 360, it's always been from

27:37.280 --> 27:41.480
the get-go that whenever the PlayStation 3 was gonna come out, they were gonna

27:41.480 --> 27:44.560
launch Halo. So it's only fitting

27:44.560 --> 27:47.600
that when they're gonna announce the PlayStation 3 launch, that they're gonna

27:47.600 --> 27:51.160
announce the Halo 3 launch which is supposedly going to happen at the

27:51.160 --> 27:56.520
Consumer Electronics Show 2006 which is happening actually in January here so

27:56.520 --> 28:01.880
few more weeks and we'll know a little bit more about Halo 3 hopefully at least

28:01.880 --> 28:06.200
that's what's going to be rumored to go down Microsoft's little trump card is

28:06.200 --> 28:11.760
that we got Halo 3 you know what though I'm sorry to say but I mean Halo is a

28:11.760 --> 28:16.280
pretty good game but a lot of the other games are coming out like Gears of War

28:16.280 --> 28:21.420
right now they're really good and this game better be damn amazing like you'll

28:21.420 --> 28:24.920
break through good in order for you know for two because pretty soon people are

28:24.920 --> 28:27.900
gonna get to the point where hey Larry hey will threes come out oh well good

28:27.900 --> 28:31.720
for you you know I don't know I think there's just there's a hardcore enough

28:31.720 --> 28:35.000
fan base for halo that it won't matter halo 3 could blow goats and it wouldn't

28:35.000 --> 28:38.720
matter it's halo you know I don't think it will though I do think it'll raise

28:38.720 --> 28:42.820
the bar because you know III have high expectations and I don't think I'll be

28:42.820 --> 28:48.460
disappointed but we'll see time will tell anyway let's move on and dark

28:48.460 --> 28:51.700
soccer you know she's got to keep us in check sometimes especially during this

28:51.700 --> 28:55.260
holiday season because you know you guys might be sitting there and you're

28:55.260 --> 28:58.340
playing these games all day long but you remember to go outside once in a while

28:58.340 --> 29:01.660
play in the snow unless you're in California then play in the rain play in

29:01.660 --> 29:05.700
the mud play in the mud and if we you know sat around and played video games

29:05.700 --> 29:11.840
all day long we'd have no time to go out and get drunk off eggnog so anyway dark

29:11.840 --> 29:14.140
DarkSakura is here to give us her advice column.

29:14.140 --> 29:18.120
DarkSakura, what are you going to tell the kids about this week?

29:18.120 --> 29:21.960
Today's piece of advice is how to stop a runaway one horse open sleigh.

29:21.960 --> 29:25.440
Now, things that could have been brought to my attention last week, DarkSakura.

29:25.440 --> 29:29.540
Sorry, I didn't know that you were going and riding in a one horse open sleigh.

29:29.540 --> 29:30.540
That's alright.

29:30.540 --> 29:31.540
Tell me anyway.

29:31.540 --> 29:32.540
Number one.

29:32.540 --> 29:33.540
Stay in the sleigh.

29:33.540 --> 29:36.480
Grip the cedar railing with one hand and the reins with the other.

29:36.480 --> 29:53.480
2. Grab the reins. If you cannot reach the reins, or they are loose and dragging on the ground, do not attempt to reach them. Hold on to the sleigh and wait for the horses to tire.

29:53.480 --> 30:04.480
3. Tug and release the reins with a medium pressure. Repeat until the horse begins to slow down.

30:04.480 --> 30:10.480
4. When the horse slows down to a slow lope or a chop, pull one rein to the side.

30:10.480 --> 30:13.480
With steady pressure, move the horse's head all the way around toward you.

30:13.480 --> 30:16.480
This will cause the horse to begin going in a circle.

30:16.480 --> 30:19.480
The horse will quickly tire of circling and slow to a walk.

30:19.480 --> 30:23.480
5. Pull back with steady pressure on both reins until the horse stops.

30:23.480 --> 30:26.480
But my final, final piece of advice...

30:26.480 --> 30:27.480
Yes, ma'am?

30:27.480 --> 30:40.560
take a taxi big political news going on I'm loving this game politics comm site

30:40.560 --> 30:45.000
it's the place for me to catch up on all the drama that's going on with various

30:45.000 --> 30:48.680
you know legislations and stuff they ran a couple stories this week about of

30:48.680 --> 30:52.400
course the California video game law being blocked by a federal judge I don't

30:52.400 --> 30:55.080
know if you heard about this we were hopefully if you listen to the show

30:55.080 --> 30:58.080
you've heard about it, because we talked about it a lot when it first came out.

30:58.080 --> 31:04.420
Well, a federal judge, that would be Judge Ronald White, actually blocked it, and somebody

31:04.420 --> 31:09.220
I guess filled game politics in on the fact that the games were protected by the First

31:09.220 --> 31:12.760
Amendment, said Judge White, children have First Amendment rights, and the concept of

31:12.760 --> 31:14.900
strict scrutiny applies.

31:14.900 --> 31:18.140
So very interesting, basically it's a First Amendment violation, as a lot of critics said

31:18.140 --> 31:19.380
it was going to be.

31:19.380 --> 31:20.380
So very interesting.

31:20.380 --> 31:26.700
Now, of course, rebuttal, coming from Yee, Assemblyman Yee, who was the one who originally

31:26.700 --> 31:32.660
wrote this bill, basically a type of, you know, the injunction is a temporary phase,

31:32.660 --> 31:37.340
blah, blah, blah, we're confident that common sense will prevail, blah, blah, blah.

31:37.340 --> 31:39.020
I thought this part was interesting.

31:39.020 --> 31:43.640
Judge White's 17-page opinion granting the injunction made clear that while a preliminary

31:43.640 --> 31:48.100
injunction may be necessary in the short term, he also challenged some of the claims made

31:48.100 --> 31:49.660
by the plaintiffs.

31:49.660 --> 31:57.060
He indicated that despite the claims of the ESA and the VDA that the act is far too burdensome

31:57.060 --> 32:01.900
to apply as a standard to video game products, that the act should be simple enough for an

32:01.900 --> 32:05.700
ordinary person to apply the games submitted to the court.

32:05.700 --> 32:08.580
But then I also thought that was kind of interesting.

32:08.580 --> 32:12.260
Medical data clearly indicates that these ultra-violent video games have harmful effects

32:12.260 --> 32:16.420
on kids, and thus we have a state interest to protect them, blah, blah, blah, you know

32:16.420 --> 32:17.420
where that's going.

32:17.420 --> 32:22.580
actually crap did you bring up something at the exact opposite on a previous show

32:22.580 --> 32:25.580
well first of all the Department of Justice has proven that there has been

32:25.580 --> 32:31.860
we're actually at an a 30-year all-time low in violence among youth first of all

32:31.860 --> 32:35.220
secondly is that just because all the kids are killing each other so there's

32:35.220 --> 32:40.180
less to commit crimes kidding it takes but it would have to take some sort of

32:40.180 --> 32:46.700
really fucked up in the head child to just go out and say oh I play Unreal

32:46.700 --> 32:54.140
tournament I'm gonna go kill everybody in my school stupid I feel like the

32:54.140 --> 32:59.540
comment about common sense and I do think common sense did prevail oh snap

32:59.540 --> 33:03.300
yeah I just I don't we've had this debate for the past six months so I'm

33:03.300 --> 33:06.340
almost a little done with it but my biggest issue with the California law

33:06.340 --> 33:11.300
was the fact that it didn't set a clear regulation seemed like the bill was open

33:11.300 --> 33:15.740
to a lot of interpretation so I hope if it is going back to the drawing board I

33:15.740 --> 33:20.780
hope that's what they work on is some type of clear set guideline some type of

33:20.780 --> 33:24.620
third-party board reviews these games and gives them the rating whatever just

33:24.620 --> 33:28.660
you know as I've said many times for they should be done just like movies

33:28.660 --> 33:33.060
what's the big deal that's how they are done in Europe you know what I'm

33:33.060 --> 33:36.500
disappointed about what Arnold Schwarzenegger really what is the

33:36.500 --> 33:41.300
problem with him with the Terminator let a lot like this be appealed so simply

33:41.300 --> 33:45.500
no the Terminator go out and kill the bastards that you know try to appeal to

33:45.500 --> 33:46.500
this law.

33:46.500 --> 33:51.680
Arnold Schwarzenegger should be just ruling California with an iron fist.

33:51.680 --> 33:53.940
You better should quit and go back to movies again, because...

33:53.940 --> 33:54.940
I just...

33:54.940 --> 33:56.940
Can we switch topics, please?

33:56.940 --> 34:00.660
Please, just because I think he's so pathetic that he's not going to get re-elected, but

34:00.660 --> 34:01.660
still.

34:01.660 --> 34:04.700
Oh, you can send those cards and letters to DarkSakura, care of Orange Lawns Radio?

34:04.700 --> 34:07.740
Oh, togo at orangelawnsradio.com, actually.

34:07.740 --> 34:08.740
Yeah.

34:08.740 --> 34:09.740
Oh.

34:09.740 --> 34:10.740
Send those flowers.

34:10.740 --> 34:11.740
Oh, let's see.

34:11.740 --> 34:12.740
Oh.

34:12.740 --> 34:18.500
gonna like go buy an island when I'm rich and infamous and create a dark

34:18.500 --> 34:25.640
sakura land where I'm you know goddess of the island. Where King Kong lives? No I don't like

34:25.640 --> 34:32.300
big hairy apes and bad adaptations of movies. Moving on moving on this is the

34:32.300 --> 34:35.740
week of course where everybody's got to whip out their best of the year list

34:35.740 --> 34:39.860
right because you know we're in that time where it's almost the the first of

34:39.860 --> 34:44.340
2006 so everybody I don't know we feel this need in our society to rank things

34:44.340 --> 34:47.420
like we've got to have a frickin best game of the year so of course some of

34:47.420 --> 34:51.740
the game sites are getting in on the fun game spy has released their list of the

34:51.740 --> 34:56.620
top 10 games of the year here they are 10 Tom Clancy splinter cell chaos theory

34:56.620 --> 35:03.180
on Xbox 9 Legend of Zelda diminished cap Game Boy Advance 8 Dragon Quest 8

35:03.180 --> 35:08.900
journey the cursed King PlayStation 2 7 Half-Life 2 on the Xbox 6 Battlefield 2

35:08.900 --> 35:15.900
on the PC, 5 Call of Duty 2 on the Xbox 360, 4 Mario Kart DS on the Nintendo DS, 3 God

35:15.900 --> 35:21.900
of War on the Playstation 2, 2 Resident Evil 4 on the GameCube, and 1 Civ 4 on the PC.

35:21.900 --> 35:24.200
It was their number one game of the year.

35:24.200 --> 35:27.260
GameSpot also did their game of the year, but they do it a little differently.

35:27.260 --> 35:31.020
They nominate, and then they name one as the game of the year, nominated, they nominated

35:31.020 --> 35:38.740
Battlefield 2, Civilization 4, F.E.A.R., Forza Motorsport, God of War, Guild Wars, Guitar

35:38.740 --> 35:45.300
hero, Mario Kart DS, Ninja Gaiden Black, and the winner was Resident Evil 4 on the GameCube.

35:45.300 --> 35:49.620
So I thought we could get in on the fun, but you know what guys, I don't want to name the

35:49.620 --> 35:53.780
best game of the year, because you know what, we're gamers, and you're going to disagree

35:53.780 --> 35:59.040
with us no matter what we say, so we're going to say our favorite game of 2005, and try

35:59.040 --> 36:02.800
to stay away from that whole controversial best of thing, because even though we like

36:02.800 --> 36:05.100
to think we're important, we know we're not.

36:05.100 --> 36:07.660
So what were our favorite games of 2005?

36:07.660 --> 36:13.060
I just want to know a runner-up and a best of and why so Loki your runner-up for best game of 2000

36:13.060 --> 36:16.420
My runner-up for best game of 2005 would be burnout

36:17.620 --> 36:21.340
Legend or burnout revenge actually screw burnout legends burnout legends sucked

36:22.180 --> 36:24.780
Burnout revenge. I played that game non-stop

36:25.780 --> 36:27.780
for months it just

36:28.240 --> 36:33.900
Really fun. The only thing it lacked was good single-player mode, but just really fun

36:33.900 --> 36:37.940
and I'm really looking forward to Burnout Revenge when it comes out in the 360.

36:37.940 --> 36:39.540
Of course, my top game for...

36:39.540 --> 36:45.580
No, no, no, no, no, no, hold on, hold on, let's get it on, I want to do my own app too!

36:45.580 --> 36:50.020
Alright, let's see, my runner-up for best game of the year, I would say probably the

36:50.020 --> 36:54.140
runner-up I would call best game of the year would probably be...

36:54.140 --> 36:58.620
This is a tough one for me, and when you put this next to my game of the year, I'm going

36:58.620 --> 37:00.940
to get some interesting reaction, but I would say my runner-up for best game of the year

37:00.940 --> 37:08.660
would be Meteos on Nintendo DS because I thought it was such a great puzzle, it really started

37:08.660 --> 37:13.420
the wave of great games coming out for the DS and I thought it was a puzzle with a lot

37:13.420 --> 37:17.720
of replayability value to it, but I got to admit, as far as DS goes, this is a very close

37:17.720 --> 37:22.540
call for me with Mario Kart DS, but my problem with Mario Kart DS is that it did feel a little

37:22.540 --> 37:25.820
bit rushed and I don't think the online was polished enough for me to really consider

37:25.820 --> 37:31.060
it a game of the year title but I do acknowledge the Nintendo has made leaps

37:31.060 --> 37:34.340
and bounds in that whole online world thing and I think Mario Kart said a

37:34.340 --> 37:37.660
great precedent but I don't think I could call it my favorite game of the

37:37.660 --> 37:42.420
year because medios got a lot more play for me so medios would be my runner-up

37:42.420 --> 37:45.940
for game of the year dark soccer you're in or out for game of the year Animal

37:45.940 --> 37:51.260
Crossing Animal Crossing T has why because I don't know it's just I played

37:51.260 --> 37:57.280
it every day it's the first game that I have even when I was so busy with school

37:57.280 --> 38:03.640
I've made time for it every day awesome so it's it get definitely gets it sounds

38:03.640 --> 38:09.140
good Loki game of the year my game of the year is just from the fact that I

38:09.140 --> 38:13.840
play it the most is gonna be Grand Theft Auto Liberty City Stories and only

38:13.840 --> 38:17.320
reason why it's the game of the year for me because this game is pretty much the

38:17.320 --> 38:20.780
exact same thing as Grand Theft Auto 3 is for the multiplayer and this is

38:20.780 --> 38:25.940
something that they should have had ever since it came out on PlayStation 2.

38:25.940 --> 38:31.260
There's no doubt about it that they shouldn't have at least brought it in by Vice City.

38:31.260 --> 38:34.980
It really needed to be in there, and the multiplayer part is literally the best part of the game

38:34.980 --> 38:40.580
for me, and I will be playing this game probably for months.

38:40.580 --> 38:46.500
My favorite game of the year, it's very interesting because I haven't seen this get a lot of,

38:46.500 --> 38:49.520
it got a lot of critical acclaim when it first came out, but it's noticeably absent from

38:49.520 --> 38:51.040
on a lot of these top game of the year lists.

38:51.040 --> 38:54.500
And honestly, this was a game that sold systems.

38:54.500 --> 38:57.580
This was a system seller, this was an amazing game.

38:57.580 --> 39:01.240
It revolutionized an entire genre of game.

39:01.240 --> 39:03.380
And I realize this is gonna sound a little weird

39:03.380 --> 39:05.660
when you put it next to my runner-up,

39:05.660 --> 39:07.000
because the fact that they were both made

39:07.000 --> 39:09.500
by the same company, but my runner-up is really the game

39:09.500 --> 39:11.020
that I played a heck of a lot of,

39:11.020 --> 39:13.300
but my game of the year is something I gotta recognize,

39:13.300 --> 39:15.500
is being like it really pushed the bar.

39:15.500 --> 39:17.820
Luminous for the PSP is absolutely my favorite game

39:17.820 --> 39:19.220
that came out this year.

39:19.220 --> 39:25.320
I think it's the reason to have a PSP for me, it really is, and I know I sound like

39:25.320 --> 39:29.420
a total puzzle game addict when you put those two side by side, but they really did push

39:29.420 --> 39:31.180
the bar in different ways for their systems.

39:31.180 --> 39:36.420
This really was, considering we're looking at the year of the current gen systems going

39:36.420 --> 39:39.460
out the door and the next gen systems coming in the door, I think this year really was

39:39.460 --> 39:41.980
the year for handhelds to shine.

39:41.980 --> 39:46.020
I think having a DS and PSP title seems very fitting, and those two really raised the bar

39:46.020 --> 39:47.020
for me.

39:47.020 --> 39:51.520
Bitch, all you want about me picking two puzzlers by the same company back to back, but they

39:51.520 --> 39:54.640
raised the bar for me in a way no other game could, and they're my picks, damn you.

39:54.640 --> 39:56.040
Dark Soccer, your game of the year.

39:56.040 --> 40:01.440
The game that made Bimani fans everywhere forget that Guitar Freaks ever existed?

40:01.440 --> 40:02.440
Guitar Hero?

40:02.440 --> 40:03.440
Very good.

40:03.440 --> 40:04.440
Very good pick.

40:04.440 --> 40:05.440
Very good pick.

40:05.440 --> 40:12.200
Because, I mean seriously, we were thinking about importing Guitar Freaks V when it comes

40:12.200 --> 40:13.200
out.

40:13.200 --> 40:19.160
like why we have guitar hero which is so much more innovative than guitar freaks

40:19.160 --> 40:23.840
because all Konami's been doing is just recycle recycle recycle oh let's not do

40:23.840 --> 40:28.120
MIDI this time but guitar freaks actually makes it feel like you're

40:28.120 --> 40:33.840
playing a guitar I thought it was very very cool of you know red octane to come

40:33.840 --> 40:37.880
out to my house and say here you can play guitar freaks in your living room

40:37.880 --> 40:42.120
on TV and I thought that that was really cool they're trying to put that time and

40:42.120 --> 40:48.180
effort into it you know to try to make it something that that people would want

40:48.180 --> 40:52.780
to play not instead of just saying oh well we're doing something like guitar

40:52.780 --> 40:55.940
freaks no no no no no they they innovated on it and I thought that was

40:55.940 --> 41:03.060
pretty cool there you have it our picks for games of the year 2005 our picks

41:03.060 --> 41:08.460
there you have it all right moving on let's talk about dark cycle you had an

41:08.460 --> 41:12.700
There is an interesting kind of feature story about innovation in the scene, what is this

41:12.700 --> 41:13.700
all about?

41:13.700 --> 41:20.940
Yeah, speaking of innovation, there is an article up on GameSpot that I thought was

41:20.940 --> 41:23.220
pretty interesting.

41:23.220 --> 41:27.700
It was one that a friend of mine who is a game tester referred me to and I thought that

41:27.700 --> 41:31.340
it was pretty interesting.

41:31.340 --> 41:39.980
Basically it's, there's not so much of a lack of innovation as much as a lack of wanting

41:39.980 --> 41:45.700
to use that innovation that's going out, you know.

41:45.700 --> 41:52.340
There's actually a very good quote in here that says, innovation is dead, dying, every

41:52.340 --> 41:55.900
once in a while somebody will slip something in that will shock us but for the most part

41:55.900 --> 41:59.840
there's no money in innovation even if it's great.

41:59.840 --> 42:06.840
The industry is really looking for what do people already like and can we make a sequel.

42:06.840 --> 42:10.720
We are seeing such sequel-intensive titles now.

42:10.720 --> 42:15.840
We see more Halos, more Metal Gear, more, you know, instead, you know, what was the

42:15.840 --> 42:17.800
last really innovative game that we got?

42:17.800 --> 42:22.120
I mean, for example, Luminous, I thought was a very good, but it's still a puzzle game.

42:22.120 --> 42:23.120
Well...

42:23.120 --> 42:26.520
Katamari Damacy now, that was innovation.

42:26.520 --> 42:28.980
But yeah, we got a sequel this year that really, well, you know...

42:28.980 --> 42:29.980
And it's more of the same.

42:29.980 --> 42:30.980
It is and it isn't.

42:30.980 --> 42:36.500
It did expand on it, but I couldn't name We Heart Katamari my game of the year because

42:36.500 --> 42:37.500
you're right.

42:37.500 --> 42:40.580
It wasn't as innovative as the first time you saw it, you know what I mean?

42:40.580 --> 42:45.500
The other quote in here, and by the way, this is by Webush Morgan Securities analyst Michael

42:45.500 --> 42:50.180
Pachter, I guess that's how his name is pronounced, says, �The best business for a publisher

42:50.180 --> 42:54.460
is to give people what you know they want, and what you know they want is a sequel to

42:54.460 --> 42:57.460
what they wanted last time, so we don't see a whole lot of innovation.�

42:57.460 --> 42:58.780
You know what's interesting to us, Sakura?

42:58.780 --> 43:00.940
I'm actually as you're saying this and talking about sequels and everything

43:00.940 --> 43:05.940
I'm looking at GameSpy's top 10 just up top my head here out of these 10 games on the list

43:06.300 --> 43:13.020
Only one of them is not a sequel or some type of story continuation type thing like, you know

43:13.100 --> 43:15.620
Tom Clancy Splinter Cell Chaos Theory, you know what I mean?

43:15.620 --> 43:18.620
Only one of these games God of War is a new title

43:18.620 --> 43:23.220
There's another good quote from here from him in here and this actually makes a lot of sense because I was just discussing this with somebody

43:23.220 --> 43:26.740
The other day I think with my well, it wasn't just with my husband

43:26.740 --> 43:30.360
it was with a couple other people because, you know, Dan and I talk games all the time.

43:30.360 --> 43:34.500
But it's another one from him that says, the problem I have with the whole sequel thing

43:34.500 --> 43:39.500
is it's not just sequels, it's once we see that World War II combat shooters work, we've

43:39.500 --> 43:43.600
got 50 of them, the funny thing is that the next year after we saw that, everyone thought

43:43.600 --> 43:47.580
if World War II worked, Vietnam would work too, but all those games were a disaster,

43:47.580 --> 43:51.840
now we've got how many more World War II games coming out.

43:51.840 --> 43:59.000
So we see them trying to go on the same path, and then it goes, no, no, no, we like this.

43:59.000 --> 44:05.620
So on top of that, it's not necessarily that there's not a willingness to innovate as much

44:05.620 --> 44:10.920
as there's not a willingness of the consumer base to test an innovative product.

44:10.920 --> 44:15.120
No, and I have to laugh just because you're mentioning about the World War II shooters

44:15.120 --> 44:17.160
and the Vietnam ones not working.

44:17.160 --> 44:23.200
Speaking of other genres of war not working, I saw a game that was actually being put out

44:23.200 --> 44:26.520
by Vivida Universal and backed by the History Channel.

44:26.520 --> 44:29.480
It was a civil war, first person to share.

44:29.480 --> 44:31.480
Yeah, that's something that would work.

44:31.480 --> 44:34.800
DarkSocko, what do you think, I got a question for you.

44:34.800 --> 44:39.400
What do you think of Nintendo's sort of response to this whole thing?

44:39.400 --> 44:44.360
It's kind of like Nintendo kind of sees, well, if the games aren't innovating, let's innovate

44:44.360 --> 44:48.760
the system and and kind of see what happens you see they're taking a big

44:48.760 --> 44:52.940
risk but that's why I say to is they're taking a big risk and Nintendo when you

44:52.940 --> 44:59.860
are Nintendo you can do no wrong yeah but the thing is is that I think that

44:59.860 --> 45:04.520
they're really resting on their laws quite a bit you know hey we're Nintendo

45:04.520 --> 45:07.880
we can get away with this crap and you'll like it cuz we said so cuz we're

45:07.880 --> 45:10.660
Nintendo do you think it's one of those things where it's like you know Nintendo

45:10.660 --> 45:13.960
sort of like they're gonna try this out but if even if they fail miserably they

45:13.960 --> 45:18.460
They could always turn the controller sideways, and it's just like any other console.

45:18.460 --> 45:19.960
You know what they're gonna do?

45:19.960 --> 45:22.960
I see them pulling an Xbox.

45:22.960 --> 45:24.960
Oh, you don't like this controller?

45:24.960 --> 45:25.960
Here's another one.

45:25.960 --> 45:28.960
You know, when we got the controller S, and now it's almost the standard?

45:28.960 --> 45:30.960
Interesting, yeah, true, true.

45:30.960 --> 45:34.960
The controller S that we got over here was the same one released with the Japanese systems,

45:34.960 --> 45:37.960
which I knew people freaking importing that controller

45:37.960 --> 45:41.960
because it's so much more comfortable than the Humongoid controller.

45:41.960 --> 45:48.600
I'm sorry. I got these little small fingers. I wouldn't touch our Xbox. So the whole thing is that now um, I

45:49.320 --> 45:53.640
Think that's what's gonna happen with Nintendo's and people are gonna go. Oh, this controller is kind of stupid

45:54.120 --> 45:59.480
We want a real one. It's I don't know again more money in the Nintendo pocket, but but

46:00.000 --> 46:04.200
If they put out the Zelda games and the Mario games and the which you know

46:04.200 --> 46:08.780
You could question is that really innovative? But if they put that kind of stuff out with the controller and it does well

46:08.780 --> 46:15.920
Well, I think that there's a very good example in here, though, of innovative projects that

46:15.920 --> 46:22.680
they've proven have worked, Psychonauts, where it was officially going to be an Xbox exclusive

46:22.680 --> 46:25.580
and Microsoft dropped it.

46:25.580 --> 46:31.040
They went to all over the place and Majesco, of course, picked it up.

46:31.040 --> 46:34.520
Again, it was on Xbox, PC, PS2.

46:34.520 --> 46:39.320
I think one of the ones that's listed in here that they went to was Vivendi, and they said

46:39.320 --> 46:42.920
they were interested in it, but said it was too risky.

46:42.920 --> 46:44.840
But it's been one of the...

46:44.840 --> 46:46.640
I haven't played enough of that game to really know, so...

46:46.640 --> 46:47.640
I haven't honestly played much.

46:47.640 --> 46:52.520
I've been considering it just because I've heard how, you know, neat it is, but still,

46:52.520 --> 46:56.680
I mean, you know, it's also, though, why we don't get a lot of the really awesome Japanese

46:56.680 --> 46:57.680
games, I think.

46:57.680 --> 47:01.840
You know, we never got, what, we never got, what, Psychic Force over here?

47:01.840 --> 47:05.340
Oh, we damn near didn't get Katamari Damacy. We didn't get Oz over here.

47:05.340 --> 47:05.840
No.

47:05.840 --> 47:06.340
So...

47:06.340 --> 47:10.340
You know, and on top of that, I think that's why it's taken so long for us to get DDR.

47:10.340 --> 47:14.840
Well, it's taken us so long. Like, we're just now getting BeatMania, and how long has it been out in Japan?

47:14.840 --> 47:16.340
Ninety...well...

47:16.340 --> 47:17.340
Ninety-three.

47:17.340 --> 47:19.840
Yeah, a long time. No, not that long.

47:19.840 --> 47:20.340
Yes.

47:20.340 --> 47:21.340
Really?

47:21.340 --> 47:21.840
Yeah.

47:21.840 --> 47:22.340
Ninety-three.

47:22.340 --> 47:22.840
It's been a while.

47:22.840 --> 47:27.340
Jeez. No, because the PlayStation...the first mix was on PlayStation. PlayStation was...well, shit, maybe.

47:27.340 --> 47:27.840
Oh, anyway.

47:27.840 --> 47:28.340
Ninety-three.

47:28.340 --> 47:30.340
Alright, whatever. So a long time.

47:30.340 --> 47:34.340
Well, keep in mind that the PlayStation was released in Japan in 1993.

47:34.340 --> 47:35.140
Yeah.

47:35.140 --> 47:38.740
Because we had mine in my dorm room in 1994, and it was new.

47:38.740 --> 47:39.700
Wow, wow, wow, wow.

47:40.900 --> 47:41.780
But it's just been...

47:42.580 --> 47:44.260
It takes forever for us to get anything,

47:44.260 --> 47:47.140
and their market, I think, is always looking for something new and fresh

47:47.140 --> 47:51.540
and something different because there's so much that's homogenous in their society.

47:51.540 --> 47:55.860
Do we have a skewed perspective, though, because we happen to be fans of those types of games,

47:55.860 --> 47:58.100
but maybe those games aren't really the ones that sell here?

47:58.100 --> 47:59.940
Because when you look at the American market,

47:59.940 --> 48:07.380
You know, despite our distaste towards these games, it is all about Madden, NBA Live, and

48:07.380 --> 48:08.380
all that stuff.

48:08.380 --> 48:09.380
You know?

48:09.380 --> 48:10.380
Is that why we...

48:10.380 --> 48:13.680
I honestly think that the average American has too narrow a scope to look for anything

48:13.680 --> 48:16.060
new and different beyond what they already know.

48:16.060 --> 48:19.340
Again, those cards and letters can go to...

48:19.340 --> 48:20.740
I said average.

48:20.740 --> 48:21.740
I know.

48:21.740 --> 48:26.300
And if you listen to this show, you've already demonstrated you have impeccable taste.

48:26.300 --> 48:30.580
Anyway, we've got to move on to another story, but that was a very, where was this again?

48:30.580 --> 48:31.580
I think this might be a good read.

48:31.580 --> 48:36.500
It was on, just the, I'll go ahead and give out the URL, it's at gamespot.com slash news

48:36.500 --> 48:41.820
slash 6141519.html.

48:41.820 --> 48:44.780
Very good article, I suggest everyone give it a thorough reading.

48:44.780 --> 48:49.980
Well, now let's counterbalance, Dark Soccer has given us something very thoughtful and

48:49.980 --> 48:54.580
a very good brain stimulant, let's go to the complete opposite end of the spectrum and

48:54.580 --> 48:57.580
Talk about Jack Thompson.

48:57.580 --> 49:03.240
Jack Thompson has bought stock in Take-Two Interactive, who publishes rock star games

49:03.240 --> 49:05.700
like The Warriors and Grand Theft Auto San Andreas.

49:05.700 --> 49:08.740
Why the hell would he do this when this is his main enemy, Dark Sakura?

49:08.740 --> 49:15.460
We brought up something on the live show about people complaining about Konami.

49:15.460 --> 49:20.460
As a stockholder, he has the right to challenge any business decision of the company.

49:20.460 --> 49:21.460
That's exactly what he's doing.

49:21.460 --> 49:23.960
He wants to be able to go to stockholder meetings.

49:23.960 --> 49:29.040
I have to say, as much as I loathe the man, that's frickin' brilliant.

49:29.040 --> 49:30.840
You know what's also brilliant?

49:30.840 --> 49:35.440
The fact that he hasn't re-registered his site, StopKill.com, which, by the way, domain

49:35.440 --> 49:37.360
is up for auction right now.

49:37.360 --> 49:40.240
So if you've got $60, you can actually go bid on it.

49:40.240 --> 49:41.240
Hey.

49:41.240 --> 49:42.240
Think about it.

49:42.240 --> 49:43.240
Think about it.

49:43.240 --> 49:47.240
That would be a great way to promote the show.

49:47.240 --> 49:48.240
All right.

49:48.240 --> 49:49.240
Of course, we'd get sued, but hey.

49:49.240 --> 49:50.240
No, we wouldn't.

49:50.240 --> 49:51.240
No, we would own it.

49:51.240 --> 49:52.240
Anyway, I don't know.

49:52.240 --> 49:53.240
We'll see.

49:53.240 --> 49:55.240
Weíll make ourselves one hell of an enemy.

49:55.240 --> 49:57.240
Do you all want to chip in 20 bucks?

49:57.240 --> 49:58.240
Iím in.

49:58.240 --> 49:59.240
Iím in.

49:59.240 --> 50:00.240
Letís do it.

50:00.240 --> 50:01.240
Letís do it.

50:01.240 --> 50:02.240
We are buying it.

50:02.240 --> 50:03.240
Loki, give me the URL.

50:03.240 --> 50:04.240
Weíll go bid on it.

50:04.240 --> 50:05.240
Iíll give you $20 right now.

50:05.240 --> 50:06.240
All right.

50:06.240 --> 50:07.240
Weíll go bid on it.

50:07.240 --> 50:08.240
Anyway, weíll see.

50:08.240 --> 50:10.240
This is the sound of my wallet unzipping.

50:10.240 --> 50:11.520
Weíll see what happens.

50:11.520 --> 50:12.520
More to come on that.

50:12.520 --> 50:14.840
Anyway, weíll talk offline about that.

50:14.840 --> 50:19.720
Also what I thought was interesting, there was a little dig here at Microsoft CEO Bill

50:19.720 --> 50:20.720
Gates.

50:20.720 --> 50:21.720
Whatís next?

50:21.720 --> 50:26.120
The game in which players can practice flying commercial jetliners into the World Trade Towers?

50:26.120 --> 50:28.440
Oh, I forgot. Microsoft already did that.

50:28.440 --> 50:30.640
Thank Time's Man of the Year, Bill Gates.

50:30.640 --> 50:33.920
Which I think is kind of a low blow. I mean...

50:33.920 --> 50:36.280
Come on.

50:36.280 --> 50:39.400
Sure, you can fly planes in two buildings, but...

50:39.400 --> 50:41.280
You crash.

50:41.280 --> 50:44.600
This is not exactly the point of the game, you dumbass.

50:44.600 --> 50:47.760
This is my open letter to Jack Thompson.

50:47.760 --> 50:51.160
Give up. Please just give up.

50:51.160 --> 50:53.360
People are laughing at you.

50:53.360 --> 50:56.560
Dog, I'm gonna laugh at you.

50:56.560 --> 51:00.360
We had a story about In the Groove, because we were talking about the guitar hero earlier.

51:00.360 --> 51:03.560
Let's talk about Red Octane's other music game that wasn't quite as critically acclaimed,

51:03.560 --> 51:04.760
but what's going on with In the Groove?

51:04.760 --> 51:09.760
In the Groove is coming to the PC, which is odd, because I thought it was already out

51:09.760 --> 51:12.760
on the PC when it was called StepMania.

51:12.760 --> 51:17.360
But yeah, apparently it's coming to the PC and Mac OS X.

51:17.360 --> 51:22.280
The features are going to be including a full editor for creating step edits like StepMania

51:22.280 --> 51:27.920
and the ability to save those edits to your USB memory card for use with In the Groove

51:27.920 --> 51:29.920
1 or 2 at the arcades.

51:29.920 --> 51:33.400
More info coming soon at inthegroove.com.

51:33.400 --> 51:37.000
Now for those people actually still playing StepMania, or as I like to call it, In the

51:37.000 --> 51:45.000
Groove 3, you can actually download a brand new build of StepMania 4.0 which isn't finalized

51:45.000 --> 51:46.000
yet.

51:46.000 --> 51:51.520
Anyways, this one has Para Para support, which you can actually use the Japanese controller

51:51.520 --> 51:56.000
with, the USB one, and they've got some test songs on there as well, so definitely worth

51:56.000 --> 51:57.000
checking out.

51:57.000 --> 51:59.160
You can find all that at stepmania.com.

51:59.160 --> 52:03.120
Pada Pada Pada Dice, because you don't look fruity enough playing DDR.

52:03.120 --> 52:04.120
Exactly.

52:04.120 --> 52:06.920
Hey, we've seen fruity on that game.

52:06.920 --> 52:08.600
I know, I know.

52:08.600 --> 52:12.800
Drunken parties where people are throwing their girlfriends' clothing.

52:12.800 --> 52:24.800
If you want to send fan letters or hate letters or letters that encourage stimulating conversation

52:24.800 --> 52:28.660
or news tips. We get an awful lot of news tips from like our buddy Rob, and I...

52:28.660 --> 52:30.360
Let me guess, do we have a Rob mail this week?

52:30.360 --> 52:34.000
We actually did get a Rob mail, but I've already covered it, because I had

52:34.000 --> 52:36.600
pulled that up from one of the sites that I review already.

52:36.600 --> 52:38.060
About, um...

52:38.060 --> 52:40.960
Actually, no, I haven't done it yet. It's an article I'd already pulled up. Sorry.

52:40.960 --> 52:42.200
Oh, but you were gonna cover it.

52:42.200 --> 52:42.960
I was gonna cover it.

52:42.960 --> 52:44.300
Oh, shit. Go for it. Why not?

52:44.300 --> 52:50.160
About Ubisoft, um, working with, uh, Taito to release, uh, Exit for the, uh,

52:50.160 --> 52:51.860
for the PSP.

52:51.860 --> 52:58.900
And it's a puzzle action game, looks like Oddworld 2, but I got my news from a different

52:58.900 --> 53:02.540
source than what he linked to me.

53:02.540 --> 53:08.500
Just to give a little background for this story, players control an escapologist called

53:08.500 --> 53:14.620
Mr. ESC, like your escape button, and must guide him around obstacles while rescuing

53:14.620 --> 53:15.620
people.

53:15.620 --> 53:19.220
You know, you have fires, earthquakes, stuff like that.

53:19.220 --> 53:23.340
A hundred different scenarios, downloadable content also made available.

53:23.340 --> 53:28.720
EXIT's also going along just for our European listeners.

53:28.720 --> 53:33.480
It's going to be, they're saying that it's going to fit in very well with some

53:33.480 --> 53:41.120
of the games being released like Frantics and Grip Shift, which is a puzzle driving game.

53:41.280 --> 53:48.060
Cool. Just a couple other of the emails received as soon as I pulled them up.

53:48.060 --> 53:53.060
one of our new listeners, Mason, who I think has just the most awesome email ever, I'm

53:53.060 --> 54:01.060
not going to give it out, but yeah, I like donuts too, um, so he, um, uh, imported Guitar

54:01.060 --> 54:06.740
Freaks controller and a copy of Guitar Freaks 4th Mix Good Game, his controller broke, honestly,

54:06.740 --> 54:11.620
third party controllers, never buy them, hello, get the Konami controller, sorry.

54:11.620 --> 54:13.900
You know what's really interesting, you know, if you want to go into history, is that who

54:13.900 --> 54:17.780
is making most of the third party controllers for Guitar Freaks? Red Octane, what's their

54:17.780 --> 54:21.300
bread and butter now. Guitar Hero, you think they're still making those third party controllers?

54:21.300 --> 54:25.380
Oh hell no. Don't think so. But instead on here, when I heard about Guitar Hero I was

54:25.380 --> 54:28.660
kind of hesitant. I wasn't sure if I should get it, will the controller break just as

54:28.660 --> 54:34.260
easily as my third party Guitar Freaks controller? Nope. No, that thing is freaking sturdy. I

54:34.260 --> 54:39.940
could probably bang it on a speaker, you know, I'll go rock out or something and it not tear

54:39.940 --> 54:43.160
up. Not that I would seriously want to do that. Here's the determining factor, do you

54:43.160 --> 54:47.300
want Guitar Hero or do you want Guitar Freaks? Do you want American rock or do you want the,

54:47.300 --> 54:51.300
you know, otaku, j-pop, co-op, you know, all that stuff.

54:51.300 --> 54:53.300
It's midi versus real guitar.

54:53.300 --> 54:57.300
Well, that too, but you know, do you want j-pop, do you want American rock?

54:57.300 --> 54:59.300
Because the song lists are vastly different between the two.

54:59.300 --> 55:02.300
Guitar Hero is worth the money that you'll spend on it.

55:02.300 --> 55:05.300
On top of that, if you're going to play Guitar Freaks,

55:05.300 --> 55:11.300
I know of sites I will tell you, you know, via email where I do my ordering from

55:11.300 --> 55:14.300
because I don't want to, unless they want to pay us.

55:14.300 --> 55:19.700
But I ordered both of my controllers for very reasonable, although they're a lot harder

55:19.700 --> 55:20.700
to get now.

55:20.700 --> 55:21.700
And Guitar Hero has freeze pop!

55:21.700 --> 55:22.700
Freeze pop!

55:22.700 --> 55:23.700
Yes, they have freeze pop!

55:23.700 --> 55:28.260
And also, it's kind of funny if you can go back and watch them making of movies, they're

55:28.260 --> 55:29.260
really fun.

55:29.260 --> 55:30.260
Any other emails?

55:30.260 --> 55:31.260
Uh, yes.

55:31.260 --> 55:43.380
yes Rodney says Roddycat has sent us an email saying about how Sega

55:43.380 --> 55:48.780
mentioning that to our Sega making a classic game story and he's thinking

55:48.780 --> 55:57.020
it's Alex Kidd. I was like well it's not quite run and gun. It's a

55:57.020 --> 56:03.580
franchise that I think should be revived yeah I actually my favorite ever game

56:03.580 --> 56:09.040
for the master system next to of course fantasy zone because I'm a big fantasy

56:09.040 --> 56:14.500
zone whore space here well yeah space Harrier but I mean like for that we're

56:14.500 --> 56:20.140
just me I really love Alex Kidd and shinobi world that's just fun for me

56:20.140 --> 56:26.060
this was more a Genesis thing but it's got to be altered beast rise from your

56:26.060 --> 56:36.280
grave anyway yeah and also we got a kudos from our Mac man for reading his

56:36.280 --> 56:43.040
last letter on here and so I'm going to say hi again Mac man so if you want to

56:43.040 --> 56:46.500
get said hi to on the air it's to go at orange launch radio comm is our email

56:46.500 --> 56:52.140
address he cracked me up he said Mac man equals I who have superb taste in

56:52.140 --> 57:03.900
computers all right huh forget it it's the Mac man our Mac look he's looking at

57:03.900 --> 57:10.300
porn on the other computer now for minutes on end I'm looking at info okay

57:10.300 --> 57:15.820
about about porn about porn about porn however though there is a game coming up

57:15.820 --> 57:20.580
that I really do want to check out this is coming out for our European audience

57:20.580 --> 57:28.680
experience, which was actually already released before as a simple 2000 series, volume 50,

57:28.680 --> 57:34.200
the Dibogyn, which is going to be re-released as Demolition Girl. It's a game where you

57:34.200 --> 57:39.680
fly around in a helicopter and you attack 50-foot women. I don't know, it just appeals

57:39.680 --> 57:40.880
to me in some way.

57:40.880 --> 57:45.240
Loki, Loki, mailbag, mailbag time. Your time later, mailbag time.

57:45.240 --> 57:46.240
Actually I'm done.

57:46.240 --> 57:49.980
Oh, okay, never mind. Anything else then about the Demolition Girl? Does it have Daryl Hannah

57:49.980 --> 57:54.980
in it. It does not have Daryl Hannah in it, but it's actually being released in Europe

57:54.980 --> 57:59.580
as a budget title, which is very interesting. Definitely need to check it out, among other

57:59.580 --> 58:02.900
games, like Kingdom Hearts 2, which I'll be playing probably this week.

58:02.900 --> 58:11.900
Oh, Kingdom Hearts 2! I watched the ending because I'm bad. I am so awful. And the ending

58:11.900 --> 58:16.100
leaves me with many more questions than anything else I've seen on the internet.

58:16.100 --> 58:19.320
So in other words, it's inevitable there's going to be a Kingdom Hearts 3?

58:19.320 --> 58:23.800
I don't know, actually, but Jamie needs this game now.

58:23.800 --> 58:29.580
I'm freaking tempted to import it, except I can't read Japanese very well.

58:29.580 --> 58:33.360
This is a good plug for our live station, which runs music from games 24 hours a day,

58:33.360 --> 58:36.860
7 days a week, at OrangeHonserator.com, because we just put in Rotation this week, the theme

58:36.860 --> 58:38.280
from Kingdom Hearts II.

58:38.280 --> 58:40.040
It's Utada Hikaru with Passion.

58:40.040 --> 58:50.040
Of course, I picked like the worst clip from- let's try another clip, here we go.

58:50.040 --> 58:56.920
Anyway, check that out over at orangeletcherd.com, that's in rotation now, so.

58:56.920 --> 59:00.680
I need that for one particular level, actually.

59:00.680 --> 59:01.680
Freakin' Tron.

59:01.680 --> 59:03.680
Freakin' Tron, I know, that'd be awesome.

59:03.680 --> 59:04.680
What?

59:04.680 --> 59:06.160
They put a Chicken Little level in there.

59:06.160 --> 59:09.200
No, Chicken Little is not in there, he's a summon.

59:09.200 --> 59:14.200
I saw that Zach Braff was doing the voice in the American version because they released the voice.

59:14.200 --> 59:18.200
That list is the one off of IMDB and it is not correct.

59:18.200 --> 59:21.200
Really? Oh.

59:21.200 --> 59:28.200
Do not trust anything that IMDB puts out as far as voice acting goes until the official list comes out.

59:28.200 --> 59:31.200
That's because IMDB is user-powered, right?

59:31.200 --> 59:33.200
Exactly.

59:33.200 --> 59:36.200
All they did was port over the actors who played them.

59:36.200 --> 59:41.200
However, I do have a strong feeling that they are going to get Johnny Depp.

59:41.200 --> 59:43.200
Well, we'll see.

59:43.200 --> 59:48.200
And, and, and, and, there's also Steamboat Willy Lovell and it's so cute!

59:48.200 --> 59:53.200
Alright, let's go over to Loki who has a couple more stories for us about, well just clear

59:53.200 --> 59:54.880
us out whatever stories you got over there, Loki.

59:54.880 --> 59:59.840
Okay, real quick, there was actually some really nice Christmas gifts that a few Game

59:59.840 --> 01:00:05.100
of Publishers have been putting out, these being in the form of new downloads for some

01:00:05.100 --> 01:00:08.500
games actually out there right now. The first one starting off with the

01:00:08.500 --> 01:00:11.860
Xbox is they've actually got some map packs coming out

01:00:11.860 --> 01:00:16.120
for Star Wars Battlefront 2 and you can get those

01:00:16.120 --> 01:00:19.940
actually available on Xbox Live and they're available

01:00:19.940 --> 01:00:24.260
they're going to be having another January pack coming out

01:00:24.260 --> 01:00:28.340
about five bucks featuring some more maps in there as well which is pretty

01:00:28.340 --> 01:00:29.060
cool.

01:00:29.060 --> 01:00:33.020
The other map pack that's coming out is actually for the PC

01:00:33.020 --> 01:00:37.340
and it's going to be for Quake 4 and you've got three free maps that you can actually

01:00:37.340 --> 01:00:42.760
download on the official website idsoftware.com so definitely check those out if you play

01:00:42.760 --> 01:00:44.420
some Quake 4.

01:00:44.420 --> 01:00:50.720
And then finally there was actually some for, oh no wait actually that was it.

01:00:50.720 --> 01:00:52.660
My mistake I had two of the same story on there.

01:00:52.660 --> 01:00:57.940
Well I thought you had a story about Wal-Mart and stockpiling 360's or something.

01:00:57.940 --> 01:01:02.460
Yes, Wal-Mart is pulling a Best Buy basically and they're going to be doing a sale for New

01:01:02.460 --> 01:01:08.700
years and they're stock probably in 360s supposedly. So definitely if you haven't got a 360 yet

01:01:08.700 --> 01:01:11.940
still interested in getting one, go check out your Walmart on New Year's Day.

01:01:11.940 --> 01:01:17.300
I've been hearing rumors that, and I can't say what my source is or where I got it from,

01:01:17.300 --> 01:01:23.300
but some of the game vendors are hoping to have their pre-orders filled by actually mid

01:01:23.300 --> 01:01:24.300
to end January.

01:01:24.300 --> 01:01:30.140
That's good news for a lot of people. Let's hope it's true. Anything else, Loki?

01:01:30.140 --> 01:01:35.340
I was just going to mention kind of in the homebrew since, um, senile team, um, the people

01:01:35.340 --> 01:01:41.500
behind this kind of a, what was it, a Streets of Rage PC game called Beats of Rage that

01:01:41.500 --> 01:01:45.820
you might have also covered it before when it was on the PSP, they did a port of it.

01:01:45.820 --> 01:01:50.980
Uh, they have a new game coming out called Age of Beasts, um, which looks like an updated

01:01:50.980 --> 01:01:56.500
version of, um, Streets of Rage but, um, they've done it in more of kind of the Altered Beast

01:01:56.500 --> 01:01:57.500
type thing.

01:01:57.500 --> 01:02:02.740
Should be really cool. I'm actually kind of looking forward to play around with it some more because you can do some shooter type stuff

01:02:02.740 --> 01:02:08.460
And I'm a pretty good game. Definitely check them out at senileteam.segaforums.com

01:02:09.060 --> 01:02:13.780
All right, and finally tonight boys and girls. I hope this didn't happen to you, but

01:02:14.740 --> 01:02:21.540
World of Warcraft call or pulled what I would call a Ragnarok online this week when they said we ban you

01:02:22.140 --> 01:02:24.140
We ban you to

01:02:24.820 --> 01:02:26.820
18,000 accounts

01:02:26.820 --> 01:02:29.320
Cancelled! Why were they cancelled?

01:02:29.820 --> 01:02:33.320
Third party programs to farm gold and items.

01:02:33.820 --> 01:02:36.820
Stop effing up the economy, you're banned.

01:02:37.320 --> 01:02:39.820
I actually got my account cancelled.

01:02:40.320 --> 01:02:42.320
You weren't one of these 18,000, were you?

01:02:42.320 --> 01:02:44.820
No, they rejected my ATM card because I got a new one.

01:02:45.320 --> 01:02:47.320
That's not nearly as interesting.

01:02:47.820 --> 01:02:50.320
I don't care if it's about you, that's not interesting. Alright.

01:02:51.820 --> 01:02:54.820
Of course if it's about me it's interesting. I'm a show diva.

01:02:54.820 --> 01:02:58.380
We're going to go around now and give everybody's final thought because we're about to wrap

01:02:58.380 --> 01:02:59.380
it up.

01:02:59.380 --> 01:03:01.780
We do have one more note for you guys, but first the final thoughts.

01:03:01.780 --> 01:03:03.660
Loki, your final thought.

01:03:03.660 --> 01:03:08.940
My final thought is I've got to get to planes of these games that I have on cue to basically

01:03:08.940 --> 01:03:13.540
play Kingdom Hearts 2, of course, because I have a walkthrough because I can't read

01:03:13.540 --> 01:03:14.540
Japanese.

01:03:14.540 --> 01:03:15.540
Alright.

01:03:15.540 --> 01:03:20.140
My final thought would be January 1st on our live show, we're making a huge announcement

01:03:20.140 --> 01:03:22.180
about the future of Orange Lounge Radio.

01:03:22.180 --> 01:03:24.840
It will change everything.

01:03:24.840 --> 01:03:26.160
It's going to be good.

01:03:26.160 --> 01:03:27.160
Check it out.

01:03:27.160 --> 01:03:31.400
Of course, if you miss that, we will say it on the podcast as well.

01:03:31.400 --> 01:03:34.480
And we're getting drunk?

01:03:34.480 --> 01:03:39.540
Well, yeah, that'll be interesting nonetheless.

01:03:39.540 --> 01:03:50.000
And of course, that will air at 2 a.m. London time the next day.

01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:51.520
Big announcement January 1st.

01:03:51.520 --> 01:03:53.800
DarkSakura, your final thought?

01:03:53.800 --> 01:03:56.620
Reject false icons and number two,

01:03:56.620 --> 01:03:59.020
remember, don't shoot the food.

01:03:59.020 --> 01:04:01.520
Now, of course, we have one other little footnote

01:04:01.520 --> 01:04:03.740
because, you know, it is the holiday season

01:04:03.740 --> 01:04:06.340
and it's, you know, we're still spreading the cheer.

01:04:06.340 --> 01:04:07.780
Even if Christmas is over, there's still,

01:04:07.780 --> 01:04:10.300
you know, Hanukkah, Kwanzaa, a bunch of holidays.

01:04:10.300 --> 01:04:13.020
My brother told me happy Kwanzaa today.

01:04:13.020 --> 01:04:15.640
Because you're so, you know, Kwanzaa's celebrating.

01:04:15.640 --> 01:04:16.480
Anyway.

01:04:16.480 --> 01:04:26.600
Anyway, we thought this was really cool, actually another podcast did this and they sent us

01:04:26.600 --> 01:04:30.240
an email saying happy holidays and we thought you'd want to share this with your listeners

01:04:30.240 --> 01:04:33.640
and I thought, you know what, this was so well produced and this was cute.

01:04:33.640 --> 01:04:37.080
I know that's probably a really bad word to describe something that a bunch of guys put

01:04:37.080 --> 01:04:38.680
together is that it's cute.

01:04:38.680 --> 01:04:39.680
That's adorable.

01:04:39.680 --> 01:04:41.700
But it's a neat song, it's cool.

01:04:41.700 --> 01:04:46.300
These guys over at DreamStationCC is their website, dreamstation.cc.

01:04:46.300 --> 01:04:49.340
The folks on the DreamStation video game show actually put this little happy holiday song

01:04:49.340 --> 01:04:53.140
together and it's kind of funny because they talk about noobs getting pwned in it, which

01:04:53.140 --> 01:04:56.400
is, you know, if you speak elite, that's pretty funny.

01:04:56.400 --> 01:05:00.340
So we thought we'd play it for you guys here, so if you want to hear more crazy antics from

01:05:00.340 --> 01:05:08.260
these guys, head on over to www.dreamstation.cc and remember kids, support independent podcasts.

01:05:08.260 --> 01:05:12.900
we're closing with this so have a great week we'll see you next time

01:05:38.260 --> 01:05:39.260
to click your heels

01:05:39.260 --> 01:05:41.020
Riding this road as you hear it squeal

01:05:41.020 --> 01:05:42.700
The town seems full of lardies

01:05:42.700 --> 01:05:44.540
and lights you'll never know

01:05:44.540 --> 01:05:46.300
It's Christmas at DreamStation

01:05:46.300 --> 01:05:48.300
where all the news gets honed

01:05:55.420 --> 01:05:57.300
The Net Cafe is where I play

01:05:57.300 --> 01:05:59.140
A ticket to gaming, I spend my day

01:05:59.140 --> 01:06:00.820
It's Christmas in Korea

01:06:00.820 --> 01:06:02.820
I haven't had food for days

01:06:02.820 --> 01:06:04.660
XBox knows it's only slow

01:06:04.660 --> 01:06:06.340
For Nintendo has nothing to show

01:06:06.340 --> 01:06:08.180
The PC's slowly dying

01:06:08.180 --> 01:06:09.940
except for the MMO.

01:06:09.940 --> 01:06:13.620
The ducks are playing Madden, the chicks are playing WoW,

01:06:13.620 --> 01:06:17.300
the PC dudes are fragging noobs, the noobs are wondering how.

01:06:17.300 --> 01:06:20.860
Carve the ham and damn the man, alienate every one of our fans

01:06:20.860 --> 01:06:24.500
from Canada to Africa in places we've never owned.

01:06:24.500 --> 01:06:29.540
It's Christmas at the station where all the noobs get owned.

01:06:29.540 --> 01:06:31.420
And just one final footnote, don't

01:06:31.420 --> 01:06:34.620
expect us to sing ever, ever.

01:06:34.620 --> 01:06:38.620
Hey, I think that we should end this show on a high note.

01:06:38.620 --> 01:06:40.060
What?

01:06:40.060 --> 01:06:41.740
Except I can't sing that.

01:06:41.740 --> 01:06:44.540
We already know how the whole singing thing

01:06:44.540 --> 01:06:45.920
went down.

01:06:45.920 --> 01:06:50.220
No, I forgot, put a copy of Karaoke Revolution over it. No, no, no, we should probably...

01:06:50.220 --> 01:06:54.300
I think when we do our little outtakes DVD,

01:06:54.300 --> 01:06:57.420
we need to put I'm Stayin' In on it.

01:06:57.420 --> 01:06:59.160
Alright.

01:06:59.160 --> 01:07:03.500
Longest show ever, good job guys. Happy holidays, this is our gift.

01:07:03.500 --> 01:07:16.740
See you next time!
