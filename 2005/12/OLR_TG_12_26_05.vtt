[SPEAKER_04]: Orange Lounge Radio To Go Edition, a week of December 26th, 2005.

00:02.669 --> 00:13.692
[SPEAKER_01]: You're tuned in to the Orange Lounge Radio To Go Edition, your podcast home for all the latest video game news and gamer chat.

00:13.972 --> 00:17.752
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, here are your hosts, DarkSakura, Sky, and Loki.

00:19.793 --> 00:21.773
[SPEAKER_03]: Ho, ho, ho, everybody.

00:23.093 --> 00:24.914
[SPEAKER_04]: Welcome to Orange Lounge Radio To Go.

00:25.734 --> 00:26.694
[SPEAKER_04]: Hope you had a great holiday.

00:27.878 --> 00:28.338
[SPEAKER_04]: Choke, choke, gasp

00:52.990 --> 00:55.332
[SPEAKER_04]: What, did you get coal in your stocking this year again?

00:55.652 --> 00:57.073
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, I did get coal in my stocking.

00:57.153 --> 00:57.573
[SPEAKER_04]: Awesome.

00:57.913 --> 00:59.314
[SPEAKER_00]: That was from me.

00:59.374 --> 01:00.475
[SPEAKER_00]: No, actually, it was from Dan.

01:00.955 --> 01:04.137
[SPEAKER_00]: It was in a little tin box that said lump of coal, and it did have a lump of coal in it.

01:05.538 --> 01:06.359
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that all he got you?

01:06.579 --> 01:10.822
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I got the most romantic gift of Dawn of the Dead.

01:11.282 --> 01:11.622
[SPEAKER_00]: Cool.

01:12.323 --> 01:16.866
[SPEAKER_00]: And Serenity, of course, and a $500 car stereo and speakers.

01:17.086 --> 01:17.506
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.

01:18.547 --> 01:18.967
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice.

01:19.047 --> 01:20.188
[SPEAKER_04]: What did Dan get me for Christmas?

01:21.029 --> 01:21.649
[SPEAKER_00]: A kick in the butt.

01:22.077 --> 01:22.717
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

01:22.777 --> 01:24.518
[SPEAKER_04]: Over there in the corner is the one and only Loki.

01:25.378 --> 01:25.698
[SPEAKER_04]: Hello.

01:26.098 --> 01:26.578
[SPEAKER_04]: How you doing?

01:27.019 --> 01:27.579
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm okay.

01:27.819 --> 01:28.119
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

01:29.079 --> 01:32.580
[SPEAKER_04]: What'd you do for the Christmas day or holiday or whatever?

01:32.600 --> 01:33.581
[SPEAKER_02]: I hung out with family.

01:33.681 --> 01:35.381
[SPEAKER_02]: That's pretty much it, yeah.

01:35.541 --> 01:36.221
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you get anything?

01:36.261 --> 01:36.762
[SPEAKER_04]: Get some loot?

01:36.882 --> 01:37.962
[SPEAKER_02]: I got salami.

01:40.063 --> 01:41.503
[SPEAKER_00]: What an awesome present!

01:41.583 --> 01:42.903
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think that's a game.

01:42.943 --> 01:44.404
[SPEAKER_04]: I haven't heard of salami.

01:44.961 --> 01:45.462
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for watching!

02:03.223 --> 02:05.484
[SPEAKER_04]: Help the Swiss Miss, save her supply of beef sticks.

02:05.504 --> 02:15.449
[SPEAKER_02]: No one gets me games for Christmas because they know that I, for one, I do work at a company that sells games, and I get tons of games anyways, and then I buy whatever I want.

02:16.309 --> 02:17.450
[SPEAKER_02]: Good point.

02:17.510 --> 02:18.070
[SPEAKER_02]: It makes it tough.

02:18.611 --> 02:19.371
[SPEAKER_04]: Good point, good point.

02:20.069 --> 02:24.031
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, well, of course, happy holidays from us here at Orange Lounge Radio to you guys.

02:24.271 --> 02:26.713
[SPEAKER_04]: And we are a day late this week because of the holidays.

02:26.753 --> 02:27.553
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, give us a break.

02:27.913 --> 02:29.654
[SPEAKER_04]: We're entitled to a vacation every once in a while.

02:30.155 --> 02:32.216
[SPEAKER_04]: But we're here doing the show for you guys tonight.

02:32.336 --> 02:33.516
[SPEAKER_00]: I was actually playing a game.

02:34.937 --> 02:37.459
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, what a good segue into how was your gaming week?

02:37.899 --> 02:38.779
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, what did you play?

02:38.919 --> 02:39.880
[SPEAKER_04]: Trivial Pursuits.

02:41.880 --> 02:42.961
[SPEAKER_04]: Was that on a console?

02:42.981 --> 02:50.945
[SPEAKER_00]: No, we did Couples Trivial Pursuits, me and Dan and his cousins and significant others and wives and things.

02:50.985 --> 02:52.486
[SPEAKER_04]: This is not a board game podcast.

02:52.506 --> 02:56.128
[SPEAKER_04]: There are some board game podcasts out there, of which we are not one.

02:56.428 --> 02:58.990
[SPEAKER_04]: So what kind of console or computer games were you playing?

02:59.070 --> 03:05.093
[SPEAKER_00]: I started Papa Lacrosse, then Dan took the PSP away from me, which I was very upset with.

03:06.738 --> 03:11.460
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I found my game sitting on my computer desk and the PSP was gone.

03:12.080 --> 03:13.001
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, well, great.

03:13.701 --> 03:15.262
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've been playing a lot of Animal Crossing.

03:16.282 --> 03:16.723
[SPEAKER_04]: Very cool.

03:18.623 --> 03:21.105
[SPEAKER_00]: And I finally got to see Need for Speed Underground on...

03:22.773 --> 03:24.454
[SPEAKER_00]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

03:53.222 --> 03:55.363
[SPEAKER_00]: Just the cop chases were awesome on it.

03:56.803 --> 03:57.143
[SPEAKER_04]: That's it?

03:59.144 --> 03:59.784
[SPEAKER_00]: For now.

04:00.104 --> 04:02.425
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, well, meow, Miss Thing, alright.

04:04.546 --> 04:07.006
[SPEAKER_04]: Somebody woke up on the wrong side of the sleigh, what's going on?

04:07.707 --> 04:08.747
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe under the sleigh.

04:08.867 --> 04:11.768
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, uh, Loki, how was your gaming week?

04:12.168 --> 04:15.989
[SPEAKER_02]: I just played a lot of multiplayer games, you know, typical work stuff.

04:16.369 --> 04:20.511
[SPEAKER_02]: Grand Theft Auto Liberty's safe story is that we actually have our six-man teams now, so...

04:22.630 --> 04:24.532
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really dense.

04:24.652 --> 04:27.213
[SPEAKER_02]: There's tons of people running around in that game, which is fun.

04:27.554 --> 04:29.995
[SPEAKER_02]: And it makes it really challenging.

04:30.676 --> 04:33.278
[SPEAKER_02]: But, I don't know.

04:33.338 --> 04:34.358
[SPEAKER_02]: Other people are getting better now.

04:34.638 --> 04:37.020
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's giving me more of a challenge, which is good.

04:37.340 --> 04:41.523
[SPEAKER_02]: And then Call of Duty 2, we've been playing multiplayer during lunch, which is really cool.

04:41.883 --> 04:45.266
[SPEAKER_02]: And I actually need to play the single player version of the game because it would be really nice.

04:45.686 --> 04:51.410
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, of course, Animal Crossing Wild World, we've been playing almost every day now.

04:52.922 --> 04:56.344
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know, it's a real easy game to pick up, play for like 10 minutes and put down.

04:56.924 --> 04:58.125
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's why I kind of like it.

04:58.805 --> 05:02.086
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't have to play it every day like friggin' Nintendogs.

05:02.626 --> 05:06.808
[SPEAKER_02]: Which I might add, I haven't played in a long time thinking about selling my last copy too.

05:06.828 --> 05:07.949
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh wow.

05:09.229 --> 05:12.991
[SPEAKER_00]: My puppies are probably flea ridden and rabid by now.

05:13.747 --> 05:17.430
[SPEAKER_04]: I was worried that Animal Crossing was going to turn out the same way as Nintendogs.

05:17.510 --> 05:20.072
[SPEAKER_04]: Now that the game's been out for a little while, what do you think?

05:20.292 --> 05:22.794
[SPEAKER_04]: Is this something you're going to still be playing six months from now?

05:24.295 --> 05:28.998
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure I'll get tired of it after a while, because six months, there's a lot of good games that are going to come out between then.

05:29.499 --> 05:33.922
[SPEAKER_02]: But it is going to be a game that I'll be playing for at least another couple months, for sure.

05:36.187 --> 05:39.948
[SPEAKER_00]: I know, I played the GameCube one all year just to get all the stuff.

05:40.068 --> 05:41.728
[SPEAKER_00]: Except I don't know that holidays are in this one.

05:42.128 --> 05:43.689
[SPEAKER_00]: Because the Japanese version didn't have holidays.

05:44.549 --> 05:45.949
[SPEAKER_04]: There's different holidays.

05:45.989 --> 05:48.310
[SPEAKER_04]: There's politically correct holidays.

05:49.250 --> 05:49.850
[SPEAKER_00]: So retarded.

05:49.870 --> 05:55.592
[SPEAKER_02]: I love the festive candle that was in there, which is the menorah and the festive tree, you know, Christmas tree.

05:58.152 --> 06:00.153
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, it was...

06:01.926 --> 06:09.169
[SPEAKER_00]: Nevermind, Foamy the Squirrel said it all for me, so I'll just let... I'll direct people to the recent Foamy the Squirrel Christmas thing.

06:09.509 --> 06:11.330
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's how I feel about it.

06:11.770 --> 06:12.790
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, check it out.

06:14.131 --> 06:14.431
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that it?

06:14.671 --> 06:15.572
[SPEAKER_04]: Anything else you want to add, Loki?

06:15.672 --> 06:17.012
[SPEAKER_04]: That's pretty much it, yeah.

06:17.092 --> 06:28.537
[SPEAKER_04]: My gaming week was pretty uneventful, honestly, because I didn't really get a whole lot of new stuff, so I've been basically, as promised last week, Final Fantasy IV Advance has been taking up a lot of my time.

06:29.898 --> 06:30.038
[SPEAKER_04]: And...

06:31.425 --> 06:34.526
[SPEAKER_04]: I also was playing Animal Crossing for a little bit and checking out some other stuff.

06:34.566 --> 06:39.448
[SPEAKER_04]: So I decided I wanted to get into something new but there wasn't a whole lot of new games that were out that I wanted.

06:40.028 --> 06:46.410
[SPEAKER_04]: So I've been seeing commercials on TV and looking around the internet lately and I've heard a lot about this service GameTap.

06:46.830 --> 06:48.231
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if you guys out there have heard of this.

06:48.291 --> 06:54.573
[SPEAKER_04]: GameTap is this thing where you can like play I think something like 300 games is what they boast in their category.

06:54.973 --> 06:55.893
[SPEAKER_04]: 300 games on demand.

06:55.953 --> 06:57.514
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like an on demand gaming service.

06:58.114 --> 07:00.395
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a very interesting business model because it's

07:01.095 --> 07:11.741
[SPEAKER_04]: Setup basically so that you pay a monthly service fee, which is right now I think they're running a special where it's a two-week free trial and a $9.95 a month for 12 months.

07:12.641 --> 07:17.664
[SPEAKER_04]: But I think normally it's about $14.95 a month is what they charge, so I'm not sure how long their special's running for.

07:18.504 --> 07:26.088
[SPEAKER_04]: But what I think is interesting is that they say, hey, this is how much you'd pay for WoW or other comparable MMOs, so I thought that was kind of an interesting way to plug it.

07:27.149 --> 07:30.631
[SPEAKER_04]: But of course the games that are accessible in the library are older games, but

07:31.428 --> 07:31.888
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

07:50.350 --> 07:51.992
[SPEAKER_04]: Namco Games are actually in the GameTap.

07:52.032 --> 08:02.201
[SPEAKER_04]: GameTap has contracts or some type of agreement with many game publishing companies such as I noticed Sega, Activision, Sierra, and Namco.

08:02.702 --> 08:08.707
[SPEAKER_04]: Not that all the games from these companies are in the library, but a few of their notable ones like Pac-Man's in the library, Dig Dugs, those type of things.

08:10.347 --> 08:19.857
[SPEAKER_04]: But what's interesting also, not every game, you know, Nintendo, you're not going to see anything by Nintendo in here, but the GameTab library has all these different areas.

08:19.877 --> 08:24.242
[SPEAKER_04]: You can either sort it by genre, you can sort it by the system, which I thought was very interesting.

08:24.302 --> 08:27.826
[SPEAKER_04]: I did not realize when I first downloaded it that they actually had Dreamcast games in there.

08:28.226 --> 08:29.186
[SPEAKER_04]: There's not very many.

08:29.206 --> 08:31.027
[SPEAKER_04]: There's only three Dreamcast games available.

08:31.267 --> 08:33.407
[SPEAKER_04]: I remember Hydro Thunder, Mr. Driller are both in there.

08:34.128 --> 08:40.669
[SPEAKER_04]: But I thought it was very interesting that, you know, Dreamcast isn't that old, all things considered, so it was kind of neat to see that in there.

08:41.249 --> 08:44.150
[SPEAKER_04]: And they also have some relatively recent PC games in there, some of the Tomb Raider games.

08:45.390 --> 08:47.171
[SPEAKER_04]: Oops, sorry, my mic's going in now.

08:47.631 --> 08:51.472
[SPEAKER_04]: Some of the Tomb Raider games, Tom Clancy games are in there.

08:53.885 --> 08:54.506
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

09:18.218 --> 09:20.379
[SPEAKER_04]: And in a way, like, okay, think about iTunes.

09:20.439 --> 09:21.159
[SPEAKER_04]: What does it allow you to do?

09:21.199 --> 09:23.520
[SPEAKER_04]: It allows you to download music legally, right?

09:23.660 --> 09:30.603
[SPEAKER_04]: But a lot of people just download their music from, what are the services out there now?

09:30.803 --> 09:34.604
[SPEAKER_04]: With a closed WinMX, they got what, what's the underground stuff out there?

09:34.644 --> 09:38.486
[SPEAKER_04]: BitTorrent, or, you know, you could download songs off of there, but

09:39.133 --> 09:39.654
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura,

09:50.558 --> 09:55.181
[SPEAKER_04]: What's interesting about GameTap is it's almost like that, but now we're talking about like abandonware and emulation.

09:55.762 --> 10:02.386
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think this is the first time, and I would say it's kind of taken the industry long enough, with the exception of these retro packs and things.

10:02.406 --> 10:17.656
[SPEAKER_04]: This is really the first time that I can recall seeing like a PC kind of trying to legalize the abandonware and emulation scene, which could be bad news for those people because as this gets more and more prevalent, you know, I think they're going to go after those types of sites, the ones that they haven't already.

10:18.257 --> 10:18.617
[SPEAKER_04]: But you know,

10:19.781 --> 10:20.403
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

10:27.156 --> 10:29.617
[SPEAKER_04]: So interface is very sleek.

10:29.757 --> 10:35.259
[SPEAKER_04]: Games download pretty quickly unless you're playing like a newer game that was originally on CD.

10:36.259 --> 10:38.620
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I played Mr. Driller on Dreamcast.

10:38.680 --> 10:40.141
[SPEAKER_04]: It took like 11 minutes to download.

10:40.621 --> 10:42.902
[SPEAKER_04]: But you can play other games in the background.

10:42.922 --> 10:45.082
[SPEAKER_04]: Like while that's downloading, I can play something on Atari 2600.

10:45.142 --> 10:51.945
[SPEAKER_04]: And what I also thought was very interesting about GameTap, and this is something I don't think a lot of people are mentioning, is that

10:53.263 --> 10:57.785
[SPEAKER_04]: GameTap is owned by Turner Broadcasting, which owns a lot of television stations.

10:58.305 --> 11:02.227
[SPEAKER_04]: And so they produce their own programming for this GameTap service.

11:02.527 --> 11:06.748
[SPEAKER_04]: One of the things they push is this MediaPlex that has their own little channels.

11:06.768 --> 11:12.170
[SPEAKER_04]: They have a reality show to pick the next GJ, as they're calling it, like a game jockey or whatever.

11:12.711 --> 11:14.331
[SPEAKER_04]: Cheesy, but OK, whatever.

11:15.232 --> 11:20.134
[SPEAKER_04]: And then they also have these little commercials that play while you're waiting to download the games.

11:21.753 --> 11:28.577
[SPEAKER_04]: and they kind of show like, you know, like a Dig Dug short funny thing or Pac-Man or whatever.

11:28.597 --> 11:29.318
[SPEAKER_04]: What was the other one I saw?

11:29.338 --> 11:31.279
[SPEAKER_04]: Like Galaxian or there's other stuff in there.

11:31.779 --> 11:40.765
[SPEAKER_04]: So what I thought was kind of neat about that is that a lot of the stuff I was seeing on GameTap is probably better than anything I've seen on G4 TV the past year.

11:41.805 --> 11:45.427
[SPEAKER_04]: So that kind of makes me go, hmm, very interesting.

11:45.467 --> 11:49.490
[SPEAKER_04]: And you know, if there's anybody from GameTap out there listening by chance, seriously,

11:50.501 --> 11:53.263
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm pretty impressed with what you guys are doing programming-wise.

11:53.683 --> 11:55.884
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm like, why don't you guys start a station?

11:55.904 --> 12:13.354
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I don't know if you guys are aware right now, but gamers are pretty much being robbed very slowly of the only representation we pretty much had on TV, which was G4, which, you know, bought Tech TV and then now is, you know, replacing their shows like Filter and G4TV.com with repeats of The Man Show and repeats of Fastlane.

12:14.035 --> 12:17.437
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, people, no one watched Fastlane the first time for a reason, okay?

12:19.349 --> 12:21.910
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to know why they're showing Star Trek The Next Generation.

12:22.130 --> 12:23.530
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, and now that too.

12:23.630 --> 12:25.171
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like, WTF, people?

12:25.391 --> 12:28.712
[SPEAKER_04]: Star Trek The Next Generation, they've become Spike now?

12:28.812 --> 12:30.412
[SPEAKER_04]: They're Spike for kids is what they're turning into.

12:30.432 --> 12:31.532
[SPEAKER_04]: But anyway, this is about GameTap.

12:31.933 --> 12:39.095
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm pretty impressed because it seems like, you know what, the people at GameTap seem to know what they're doing, unlike the folks at G4.

12:39.495 --> 12:47.157
[SPEAKER_04]: So if this is promising that they might try to do a station, I think it would be really neat to see.

12:47.597 --> 12:47.757
[SPEAKER_04]: So...

12:48.770 --> 12:52.892
[SPEAKER_04]: As a gamer who feels underrepresented on the cable box right now, I think that's very interesting.

12:53.212 --> 12:55.734
[SPEAKER_02]: And GameTap, you know, that would be a good name for a station anyway.

12:55.754 --> 12:57.294
[SPEAKER_04]: Hmm, things to consider.

12:58.155 --> 12:59.736
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, so that's cool.

12:59.756 --> 13:00.236
[SPEAKER_04]: I like the media.

13:00.256 --> 13:00.776
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a big plus.

13:01.557 --> 13:04.558
[SPEAKER_04]: The service itself, you know, it does have some issues now.

13:04.598 --> 13:05.759
[SPEAKER_04]: I had some graphical glitches.

13:06.159 --> 13:10.521
[SPEAKER_04]: I have had the system lock up completely when some of the video tries to download.

13:10.901 --> 13:15.284
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if that's my system specifically or if that's, you know, maybe more people are going to have problems with that.

13:15.404 --> 13:15.764
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

13:16.304 --> 13:21.626
[SPEAKER_04]: But anyway, I do recommend GameTap, especially if you're a fan of retro gaming things.

13:22.927 --> 13:24.027
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a two-week free trial.

13:24.387 --> 13:25.048
[SPEAKER_04]: Check it out.

13:25.128 --> 13:25.648
[SPEAKER_04]: Why not?

13:26.448 --> 13:27.088
[SPEAKER_04]: It's pretty cool.

13:27.649 --> 13:35.892
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's one of those things that's going to get better with time, because it's still in the early stages, and I know they recently signed deals with Capcom and some other publishers as well, and I think I read something.

13:35.912 --> 13:38.773
[SPEAKER_04]: They want to grow to like 1,000 games by this time in a year or so.

13:39.522 --> 13:39.602
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki,

14:08.550 --> 14:09.051
[SPEAKER_02]: It looked good.

14:10.112 --> 14:10.572
[SPEAKER_02]: I like it.

14:11.233 --> 14:22.864
[SPEAKER_02]: Even something really cool if it was on a set-top console thing, like if they could come out with some sort of really bare-bones wireless controller thing, kind of like the Phantom.

14:22.884 --> 14:25.067
[SPEAKER_02]: They were talking about doing all streaming.

14:26.428 --> 14:28.990
[SPEAKER_02]: That model could work, except the Phantom sucks, but...

14:30.424 --> 14:39.046
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know, it looks good though, I mean, it's definitely something worth checking out, especially if you've got, definitely want some controllers or something for your PC, you know.

14:39.787 --> 14:49.509
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that's my other complaint, but that's not GameTap's fault, is that my controller sucks, so it's not, I mean, it is neat that GameTap, you know, picked it right up and knew what kind of controller I had, but it sucks.

14:49.769 --> 14:51.510
[SPEAKER_04]: I need to get something better if I want to use a controller.

14:51.752 --> 14:53.473
[SPEAKER_02]: But still, though, I mean, it looks good.

14:53.673 --> 14:55.213
[SPEAKER_02]: And I like the way the interface was.

14:55.313 --> 14:56.274
[SPEAKER_02]: That was really cool, actually.

14:56.414 --> 15:03.617
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, as somebody who often reports on this program about what's going on underground, would you actually pay for something like GameTap?

15:04.557 --> 15:05.217
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, no.

15:05.417 --> 15:13.461
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I don't have enough time to actually sit there and go play a lot of games online, let alone pay $9.95 a month for something.

15:13.761 --> 15:17.662
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, look, I still subscribe to Final Fantasy XI.

15:17.702 --> 15:18.363
[SPEAKER_02]: God knows why.

15:18.383 --> 15:19.923
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't played the game in, like, six months.

15:20.444 --> 15:21.104
[SPEAKER_02]: But, um...

15:22.148 --> 15:24.349
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure, I don't know, I guess.

15:24.389 --> 15:28.252
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that's going to be most people's sticking point with GameTap is that there's not a lot of new stuff on there.

15:28.272 --> 15:31.694
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you want to play the new cutting edge stuff, GameTap's probably not for you.

15:32.374 --> 15:33.695
[SPEAKER_04]: GameTap's more of like a library.

15:33.715 --> 15:37.897
[SPEAKER_04]: But it shows potential and maybe, who knows, companies might pick up on this model.

15:38.878 --> 15:46.783
[SPEAKER_04]: The other thing I wanted to say before we get into the news, I'm sorry to spend so much time on this, because this really made me think about this, the whole GameTap thing, is it really made me think about

15:47.543 --> 15:49.989
[SPEAKER_04]: I bet you anything this is how Nintendo Revolution is going to be set up.

15:50.069 --> 15:58.327
[SPEAKER_04]: I bet you Nintendo Revolution with its old Nintendo classics, because when I started not seeing the Nintendo games in GameTap, I thought, you know what, Nintendo Revolution, I bet you this is going to be the same model.

15:58.914 --> 16:05.159
[SPEAKER_04]: Choose your console, choose $9.95 a month, $14.95 a month, whatever they're going to charge, and then the unlimited play of the old Nintendo games.

16:05.420 --> 16:07.822
[SPEAKER_04]: I bet you anything, Revolution's going to have the same business model.

16:07.922 --> 16:24.015
[SPEAKER_02]: Or they could just do something very similar to Xbox Live, where you have the silver, which doesn't allow you to play the old games or whatever, and then you can pay the gold, which is $9.95, you get all the old games from all the systems, plus whatever other crap that they throw on there as well for download.

16:24.375 --> 16:24.535
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

16:24.776 --> 16:24.916
[SPEAKER_04]: Hmm.

16:25.256 --> 16:25.777
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

16:37.586 --> 16:46.411
[SPEAKER_04]: Microsoft, of course, has been shipping out a little more and more now, and they're saying that they're going to start doing these weekly shipments, but, you know, a lot of people still say, you know, don't hold your breath.

16:46.731 --> 16:51.593
[SPEAKER_04]: If you didn't pre-order, you're still not getting one of these until March, if you're an EB Games or GameStop shopper.

16:52.994 --> 17:01.238
[SPEAKER_04]: Local magazine, or not magazine, newspaper, San Jose Mercury News actually said, Microsoft is disappointed that it can't get more units of the Xbox 360 into the market.

17:01.558 --> 17:05.340
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's, you know, Microsoft has that regret there, so I don't know what

17:05.860 --> 17:07.721
[SPEAKER_04]: What that's about, because you'd think they'd do something about it.

17:08.001 --> 17:19.347
[SPEAKER_04]: But anyway, what's interesting is that the reporter from the San Jose Mercury News, Dean Takahashi, also said in his personal blog, various folks tell me that the shortage isn't a problem with chip yields.

17:19.847 --> 17:21.328
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's more of a systems issue.

17:21.428 --> 17:24.670
[SPEAKER_04]: When the boxes come together, they're working on getting more units out.

17:25.549 --> 17:30.591
[SPEAKER_04]: So this guy's saying that maybe it's not the chip shortage, it's the fact they just can't package them fast enough.

17:30.991 --> 17:33.551
[SPEAKER_04]: Which is a little disappointing, if that's really it.

17:33.892 --> 17:36.192
[SPEAKER_04]: Because you think they would have gotten the resources for that.

17:36.212 --> 17:42.654
[SPEAKER_02]: I think they might be afraid that they're running into these glitches that people are running into now with the overheating and stuff.

17:42.674 --> 17:45.995
[SPEAKER_02]: They're trying to get more working units that don't have these same problems.

17:46.976 --> 17:47.656
[SPEAKER_02]: That could be it.

17:47.816 --> 17:51.197
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, you know, comes down to a quality control problem or something.

17:52.344 --> 17:54.785
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, you have another story about the shipment of Xbox 360s.

17:55.005 --> 17:55.125
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, oh...

18:18.121 --> 18:34.677
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, there's a bit of word out because they were checking about Microsoft UK as far as if they were going to get their shipments out, and they said that they're actually on track to meet their 90-day forecast that they had out of 2.75 to 3 million units to go out.

18:36.719 --> 18:40.263
[SPEAKER_00]: As far as the US shipment is concerned,

18:40.883 --> 18:46.526
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a quote that I found that says they're working around the clock to deliver as many Xbox 360 consoles as humanly possible.

18:47.126 --> 18:54.650
[SPEAKER_00]: There is, though, a pretty rampant disappointment throughout Microsoft US about how low the shipments have been.

18:55.470 --> 18:58.212
[SPEAKER_00]: I still think it's purposeful, but...

18:59.398 --> 19:00.439
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll see, we'll see.

19:00.699 --> 19:02.281
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, Loki, you have a story also.

19:02.361 --> 19:04.344
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, there's one more thing about that.

19:04.724 --> 19:16.879
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, it was asked about that and said that there was any, Microsoft's competitors are actually even thinking that they're legitimate, that the shortage is legitimate.

19:17.379 --> 19:21.084
[SPEAKER_00]: The quote from Sony's Phil Harrison says that, I don't believe that for a second.

19:21.164 --> 19:27.992
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that it's clear that they're making every unit that they can, whether that is enough for demand or that they can't make enough is a question you'll have to put to Microsoft.

19:28.052 --> 19:29.654
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's definitely not done on purpose.

19:29.894 --> 19:32.737
[SPEAKER_04]: That's interesting little support from the competition there.

19:32.938 --> 19:33.218
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

19:33.358 --> 19:33.899
[SPEAKER_04]: Very interesting.

19:34.315 --> 19:38.117
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki, you have some news relating to the Xbox Live Diamond account now?

19:38.157 --> 19:40.198
[SPEAKER_04]: There's silver, gold, and diamond now?

19:40.258 --> 19:41.959
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it's a diamond card.

19:42.019 --> 19:44.781
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not necessarily anything that you have to pay for.

19:44.801 --> 19:52.385
[SPEAKER_02]: If you have an Xbox Live Gold membership, you can actually subscribe using your Gamertag to this diamond card.

19:52.545 --> 19:57.488
[SPEAKER_02]: It's basically this little card that you get that has this cool little graphics on there plus your Gamertag.

19:58.048 --> 20:02.950
[SPEAKER_02]: and they have a bunch of affiliates with Microsoft that are offering discounts for it.

20:02.970 --> 20:05.050
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's kind of like one of those discount cards that you get.

20:05.490 --> 20:16.534
[SPEAKER_02]: So basically if you go to Xbox, I believe it's XboxLiveDiamondCard.com Let me see here real quick.

20:16.994 --> 20:19.575
[SPEAKER_02]: It's XboxLiveDiamond.com, that's what it was.

20:20.575 --> 20:26.777
[SPEAKER_02]: You go there, you put your gamer tag in and you sign up and they'll basically ship it to your address that you have signed up with.

20:27.970 --> 20:30.575
[SPEAKER_04]: What if you have an Xbox regular live account?

20:31.316 --> 20:31.717
[SPEAKER_04]: No dice?

20:31.897 --> 20:32.518
[SPEAKER_04]: Or can you still get it?

20:32.719 --> 20:32.919
[SPEAKER_04]: Nope.

20:33.600 --> 20:34.262
[SPEAKER_04]: Ah, sucks!

20:35.660 --> 20:36.561
[SPEAKER_02]: Give it the times, folks.

20:37.461 --> 20:44.806
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyways, no, but some of the actual affiliates that they have right now, they're talking about, like, McDonald's.

20:45.686 --> 20:49.189
[SPEAKER_02]: I saw, what was it, like, Carl's Jr., Burger King type stuff on there.

20:50.189 --> 20:53.571
[SPEAKER_04]: I know as well... Just what a gamer needs, fast food discounts.

20:53.611 --> 20:54.272
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, exactly.

20:54.292 --> 20:58.014
[SPEAKER_04]: How about getting some fresh choice discounts in there?

20:58.114 --> 21:00.416
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, yo, hey, no, no, no.

21:00.456 --> 21:03.397
[SPEAKER_02]: They've got, like, for example, and this is actually on the website, they have...

21:04.794 --> 21:09.197
[SPEAKER_02]: Hollywood Video, you rent a movie or video game, get the second rental free.

21:09.297 --> 21:11.839
[SPEAKER_02]: Sam Goody, 10% off of DVDs and CDs.

21:11.899 --> 21:16.222
[SPEAKER_02]: Quiznos, buy a sandwich, get the second one free.

21:17.442 --> 21:19.644
[SPEAKER_02]: 50% off of Cambridge Soundworks speakers.

21:19.664 --> 21:24.127
[SPEAKER_02]: 20% off of Etnies shoes.

21:24.587 --> 21:26.468
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a big list of stuff.

21:30.011 --> 21:30.611
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry, microphone.

21:30.948 --> 21:33.269
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going over to DarkSakura because maybe she'll back me up on this.

21:33.329 --> 21:37.851
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it just me or could Xbox be the moralist here and offer discounts for 24-hour fitness?

21:40.012 --> 21:46.614
[SPEAKER_00]: I wish they would, but they're going to cater to... Sorry, the typical gamer.

21:46.854 --> 21:54.297
[SPEAKER_00]: I hate to say it, but I don't know many average gamers who are into fitness and health.

21:54.357 --> 21:56.178
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I know lots who are, yeah, but...

21:56.946 --> 22:00.147
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, if you think about your average, say, your college... What's the stereotype?

22:00.647 --> 22:02.168
[SPEAKER_00]: The stereotype, like the college frat boy.

22:04.328 --> 22:04.508
[SPEAKER_00]: No.

22:06.109 --> 22:10.710
[SPEAKER_00]: And on top of that, honestly, promoting a lazy lifestyle helps their business.

22:12.170 --> 22:12.510
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki.

22:12.711 --> 22:16.031
[SPEAKER_02]: Honestly, which has Wi-Fi for the DS?

22:16.692 --> 22:18.172
[SPEAKER_02]: McDonald's or Fresh Choice?

22:19.112 --> 22:19.833
[SPEAKER_02]: I make my point.

22:19.933 --> 22:22.253
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to... Fresh Choice is only in California.

22:22.593 --> 22:24.954
[SPEAKER_04]: Oops, sorry, I made a regional joke.

22:26.158 --> 22:27.218
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry, what, Jamba Juice?

22:27.258 --> 22:27.859
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that nationwide?

22:27.879 --> 22:29.339
[SPEAKER_04]: That's borderline healthy.

22:29.679 --> 22:32.520
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't have Jamba Juice in my part of Alabama.

22:32.680 --> 22:33.460
[SPEAKER_04]: Ah, forget it then.

22:34.841 --> 22:36.021
[SPEAKER_00]: So you know what they need to have?

22:36.261 --> 22:36.461
[SPEAKER_04]: What?

22:37.301 --> 22:42.143
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like they have the life fitness bikes that you can watch TV or listen to your CD player on.

22:42.603 --> 22:49.585
[SPEAKER_00]: They need to have one with like an Xbox 360 hooked up to it so it will shut down if you stop pedaling.

22:50.365 --> 22:50.825
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go.

22:51.185 --> 22:53.586
[SPEAKER_02]: Or if you pedal too fast and it gets too hot.

22:56.073 --> 22:56.413
[SPEAKER_04]: Lame.

22:56.774 --> 23:00.496
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, Loki, speaking of Xbox 360, what the hell's going on with Dead or Alive 4?

23:01.557 --> 23:03.959
[SPEAKER_02]: It's actually been delayed again.

23:03.979 --> 23:04.559
[SPEAKER_02]: Surprise!

23:05.059 --> 23:05.960
[SPEAKER_02]: Only a couple more days.

23:06.540 --> 23:07.121
[SPEAKER_02]: It's actually...

23:07.762 --> 23:15.484
[SPEAKER_02]: The people that have been reviewing the final copy, which is supposedly going gold here pretty soon, actually gave it 100%, you know, out of 100.

23:15.624 --> 23:17.344
[SPEAKER_02]: Just a really good game.

23:17.664 --> 23:25.205
[SPEAKER_02]: They're basically working on the online, make sure it's very balanced, and they just want to make sure the game's good before it goes out.

23:25.626 --> 23:30.326
[SPEAKER_02]: And supposedly now the new date is January 2nd, and it's going to be the new ship date on it.

23:30.447 --> 23:32.127
[SPEAKER_02]: So expect it in stores around the 3rd.

23:33.390 --> 23:33.910
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

23:58.599 --> 23:59.140
[SPEAKER_04]: That is it.

23:59.200 --> 24:00.862
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh god, we covered that in a previous show.

24:00.883 --> 24:01.563
[SPEAKER_04]: That is it.

24:01.924 --> 24:02.285
[SPEAKER_02]: Nothing.

24:02.365 --> 24:02.645
[SPEAKER_02]: Nada.

24:03.006 --> 24:06.751
[SPEAKER_02]: And now we're just talking about Dead or Alive 4 for this next week.

24:07.051 --> 24:11.938
[SPEAKER_02]: Only game coming out on the consoles and then the next week there's a couple games and then that's it.

24:11.958 --> 24:13.681
[SPEAKER_02]: Then your next big game is going to be 25 to Life.

24:14.912 --> 24:17.934
[SPEAKER_04]: And then Jamie, you were saying that UK's lineup looks pretty similar.

24:18.134 --> 24:19.616
[SPEAKER_04]: It's pretty much a ghost town for a little while.

24:19.816 --> 24:20.096
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

24:20.676 --> 24:24.559
[SPEAKER_00]: So after the next big, you know, sell period comes up.

24:24.740 --> 24:24.960
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

24:25.380 --> 24:25.680
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

24:26.141 --> 24:26.461
[SPEAKER_04]: Interesting.

24:27.241 --> 24:27.602
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

24:27.822 --> 24:29.523
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's do some console balance here.

24:29.563 --> 24:30.524
[SPEAKER_04]: We've talked enough about Xbox 360.

24:30.564 --> 24:32.305
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's talk a little bit about PS3.

24:32.345 --> 24:36.909
[SPEAKER_04]: I know DarkSakura has a story about finally we know, like, a game that might be coming to PS3.

24:36.929 --> 24:37.029
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

24:39.312 --> 24:45.016
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, Unreal Tournament 2007 is coming out for the PlayStation 3 and it's set in Spring 2006.

24:45.496 --> 24:50.460
[SPEAKER_04]: I think the date is almost more interesting than the announcement of the game itself.

24:50.580 --> 24:51.180
[SPEAKER_04]: That's great.

24:51.460 --> 24:52.801
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's actually pretty cool.

24:53.121 --> 24:56.464
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I don't think it's too surprising that it's going to be on PlayStation 3.

24:57.624 --> 25:02.908
[SPEAKER_00]: But just the... I mean, honestly, to be out so quickly...

25:04.437 --> 25:06.379
[SPEAKER_04]: That's surprising to me, but actually I'm not so surprised.

25:06.679 --> 25:14.644
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I am a little bit surprised by the fact that it's coming on PS3 because when I think about Unreal Tournament previous games, I think of Xbox.

25:14.824 --> 25:19.287
[SPEAKER_04]: But maybe that's just because that's where I owned Unreal before I sold it back finally because I was bored of it.

25:19.667 --> 25:23.170
[SPEAKER_04]: But, you know, I kind of always thought of it as an Xbox title, but yeah.

25:24.741 --> 25:36.365
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I have a feeling that we're going to see it on Xbox 360, but just that it's going to be, I'm just sort of, the whole announcement together is sort of like the, whoa.

25:37.505 --> 25:48.609
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, they could do Grand Theft Auto San Andreas where they put it out on one console exclusively for, you know, X amount of months, nine months or whatever, and then they bring it out on the other systems later.

25:50.889 --> 26:07.053
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, I have a story about Nintendo Revolution, and that actually has to do with Zelda Twilight Princess, is that in a Nintendo magazine released in Europe, it's actually NGC, in their January 2006 issue, they're saying that Twilight Princess is going to be using the Revolution controller.

26:07.953 --> 26:12.795
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a quote here, our development team has decided to take extra time to add some incredible elements.

26:13.815 --> 26:18.056
[SPEAKER_04]: There were elements that Miyamoto said were simply far too good to leave out.

26:18.800 --> 26:26.263
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, we kind of heard about the delays the first time being the fact that they're going to add something Revolution special here.

26:26.283 --> 26:28.104
[SPEAKER_04]: So it looks like the controller is a big part of that.

26:28.124 --> 26:31.205
[SPEAKER_04]: So it kind of pieces together with what we heard about the delay the first time.

26:31.286 --> 26:37.888
[SPEAKER_04]: So that whole innovative controller thing will somehow come into play with the Revolution.

26:38.269 --> 26:38.589
[SPEAKER_04]: Interesting.

26:39.670 --> 26:40.991
[SPEAKER_04]: That's really all I got on the Revolution.

26:41.011 --> 26:42.112
[SPEAKER_04]: There's not a whole lot of other news.

26:42.152 --> 26:42.832
[SPEAKER_04]: You got something?

26:42.912 --> 26:46.414
[SPEAKER_02]: I got something real quick on the PlayStation 3, which I thought was very interesting.

26:46.695 --> 26:52.338
[SPEAKER_02]: Everyone's wondering what the Blu-ray thing, they were talking about region coding, whether they're actually just going to get rid of it or what's going on.

26:52.458 --> 26:54.860
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, at least for the U.S.

26:54.960 --> 27:02.545
[SPEAKER_02]: and Japanese, there's not going to be a real big issue because the region coding for the Blu-ray has been announced, and Japan and U.S.

27:02.745 --> 27:05.487
[SPEAKER_02]: are in the same region code, which should be very interesting.

27:05.567 --> 27:05.667
[SPEAKER_02]: Hmm.

27:06.187 --> 27:14.270
[SPEAKER_02]: Unfortunately, Europe, they're going to be getting the bone again as they put it in this article here because they're in a different region.

27:14.290 --> 27:16.831
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, that's not a surprise because their TVs are a different format.

27:17.471 --> 27:21.252
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, but with the high-def TVs, I would have figured they're all in the same format now.

27:21.272 --> 27:22.773
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, but how many people really have high-def?

27:22.793 --> 27:23.593
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

27:24.873 --> 27:33.396
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, anyway, Loki, you had a story now about two of the systems here, PlayStation 3 versus Xbox 360 and what Microsoft's kind of,

27:33.956 --> 27:42.758
[SPEAKER_02]: The whole thing with the 360, it's always been from the get-go that whenever the PlayStation 3 was going to come out, they were going to launch Halo.

27:43.198 --> 27:56.320
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's only fitting that when they're going to announce the PlayStation 3 launch that they're going to announce the Halo 3 launch, which is supposedly going to happen at the Consumer Electronics Show 2006, which is happening actually in January here.

27:56.360 --> 28:00.481
[SPEAKER_02]: So a few more weeks and we'll know a little bit more about Halo 3.

28:01.226 --> 28:04.087
[SPEAKER_02]: Hopefully, at least that's what's going to be rumored to go down.

28:04.267 --> 28:07.168
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that's always Microsoft's little trump card, is that, well, we got Halo 3.

28:07.208 --> 28:08.769
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh-huh, we got Halo 3.

28:08.929 --> 28:09.649
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know what, though?

28:09.789 --> 28:17.673
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry to say it, but I mean, Halo is a pretty good game, but a lot of the other games that are coming out, like Gears of War right now, they're really good.

28:18.113 --> 28:28.557
[SPEAKER_02]: And this game better be damn amazing, like, you know, breakthrough good in order for it to... Because pretty soon people are going to get to the point where, Halo 3's coming out, oh, well, good for you, you know.

28:29.727 --> 28:30.007
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

28:30.047 --> 28:33.289
[SPEAKER_04]: I think there's a hardcore enough fanbase for Halo that it won't matter.

28:33.329 --> 28:35.190
[SPEAKER_04]: Halo 3 could blow goats, and it wouldn't matter.

28:35.250 --> 28:35.670
[SPEAKER_04]: It's Halo.

28:37.211 --> 28:37.992
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think it will, though.

28:38.032 --> 28:43.375
[SPEAKER_04]: I do think it'll raise the bar, because I have high expectations, and I don't think I'll be disappointed.

28:43.835 --> 28:44.275
[SPEAKER_04]: But we'll see.

28:44.716 --> 28:45.156
[SPEAKER_04]: Time will tell.

28:46.104 --> 29:01.169
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, let's move on, and DarkSakura, you know, she's got to keep us in check sometimes, especially during this holiday season, because, you know, you guys might be sitting there and you're playing these games all day long, but you need to remember to go outside once in a while, play in the snow, unless you're in California, then play in the rain.

29:01.469 --> 29:01.929
[SPEAKER_04]: Play in the mud.

29:02.529 --> 29:02.889
[SPEAKER_04]: Play in the mud.

29:03.910 --> 29:09.951
[SPEAKER_04]: And if we, you know, sat around and played video games all day long, we'd have no time to go out and get drunk off an eggnog.

29:11.032 --> 29:13.993
[SPEAKER_04]: So, anyway, DarkSakura's here to give us her advice column.

29:14.013 --> 29:14.573
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura,

29:15.114 --> 29:16.695
[SPEAKER_04]: What are you going to tell the kids about this week?

29:17.796 --> 29:21.800
[SPEAKER_00]: Today's piece of advice is how to stop a runaway one-horse open sleigh.

29:22.300 --> 29:25.383
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, things that could have been brought to my attention last week, DarkSakura.

29:25.923 --> 29:29.346
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry, I didn't know that you were riding in a one-horse open sleigh.

29:29.406 --> 29:29.947
[SPEAKER_04]: That's all right.

29:30.007 --> 29:30.527
[SPEAKER_04]: Tell me anyway.

29:30.747 --> 29:32.669
[SPEAKER_00]: Number one, stay in the sleigh.

29:33.230 --> 29:36.192
[SPEAKER_00]: Grip the cedar railing with one hand and the reins with the other.

29:37.794 --> 29:40.796
[SPEAKER_03]: Did they just kind of translate the rules of a Ferris wheel?

29:41.937 --> 29:42.438
[SPEAKER_03]: No, forget it.

29:42.458 --> 29:42.738
[SPEAKER_03]: Go ahead.

29:43.787 --> 29:44.768
[SPEAKER_00]: 2.

29:44.007 --> 29:44.768
[SPEAKER_00]: Grab the reins.

29:45.328 --> 29:49.872
[SPEAKER_00]: If you cannot reach the reins or they are loose and dragging on the ground, do not attempt to reach them.

29:50.292 --> 29:52.874
[SPEAKER_00]: Hold on to the sleigh and wait for the horses to tire.

29:53.414 --> 29:55.596
[SPEAKER_00]: Why is it horses if it's a one horse open sleigh?

29:55.616 --> 29:56.277
[SPEAKER_00]: It's so retarded.

29:56.777 --> 29:57.037
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, 3.

29:58.118 --> 30:01.120
[SPEAKER_00]: Tug and release the reins with a medium pressure.

30:01.641 --> 30:03.602
[SPEAKER_00]: Repeat until the horse begins to slow down.

30:05.083 --> 30:03.602
4.

30:05.664 --> 30:08.426
[SPEAKER_00]: When the horse slows down to a slow lope or a chop...

30:09.341 --> 30:10.762
[SPEAKER_00]: Pull one rein to the side.

30:11.082 --> 30:14.024
[SPEAKER_00]: With steady pressure, move the horse's head all the way around toward you.

30:14.384 --> 30:16.585
[SPEAKER_00]: This will cause the horse to begin going in a circle.

30:16.725 --> 30:19.186
[SPEAKER_00]: The horse will quickly tire of circling and slow to a walk.

30:20.047 --> 30:19.186
5.

30:20.507 --> 30:23.749
[SPEAKER_00]: Pull back with steady pressure on both reins until the horse stops.

30:24.609 --> 30:27.631
[SPEAKER_00]: But my final, final piece of advice... Yes, ma'am?

30:28.431 --> 30:28.972
[SPEAKER_00]: Take a taxi.

30:35.515 --> 30:36.896
[SPEAKER_04]: Big political news going on.

30:38.413 --> 30:40.795
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm loving this GamePolitics.com site.

30:40.895 --> 30:46.739
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the place for me to catch up on all the drama that's going on with various legislations and stuff.

30:47.039 --> 30:52.082
[SPEAKER_04]: They ran a couple stories this week about, of course, the California video game law being blocked by a federal judge.

30:52.102 --> 30:53.023
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if you've heard about this.

30:53.363 --> 30:57.966
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, hopefully, if you've listened to the show, you've heard about it, because we talked about it a lot when it first came out.

30:58.306 --> 31:06.612
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, a federal judge, that would be Judge Ronald White, actually blocked it, and somebody, I guess, filled GamePolitics in on the fact that

31:07.512 --> 31:10.435
[SPEAKER_04]: The games were protected by the First Amendment, said Judge White.

31:10.735 --> 31:14.217
[SPEAKER_04]: Children have First Amendment rights and the concept of strict scrutiny applies.

31:14.858 --> 31:15.779
[SPEAKER_04]: So, very interesting.

31:15.819 --> 31:18.881
[SPEAKER_04]: Basically, it's a First Amendment violation as a lot of critics said it was going to be.

31:19.341 --> 31:20.102
[SPEAKER_04]: So, very interesting.

31:20.502 --> 31:27.527
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, of course, rebuttal coming from Yee, Assemblyman Yee, who was the one who originally wrote this bill.

31:28.388 --> 31:29.549
[SPEAKER_04]: Basically, a type of, you know,

31:30.109 --> 31:37.137
[SPEAKER_04]: The injunction is a temporary phase, blah blah blah, we're confident that common sense will prevail, blah blah blah.

31:37.457 --> 31:38.419
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought this part was interesting.

31:38.859 --> 31:49.131
[SPEAKER_04]: Judge White's 17-page opinion granting the injunction made clear that while a preliminary injunction may be necessary in the short term, he also challenged some of the claims made by the plaintiffs.

31:51.593 --> 32:04.924
[SPEAKER_04]: He indicated that despite the claims of the ESA and the VDA that the Act is far too burdensome to apply as a standard to video game products, that the Act should be simple enough for an ordinary person to apply the games submitted to the court.

32:05.625 --> 32:07.146
[SPEAKER_04]: But then I also thought this was kind of interesting.

32:08.327 --> 32:16.994
[SPEAKER_04]: Medical data clearly indicates that these ultra-violent video games have harmful effects on kids, and thus we have a state interest to protect them, blah, blah, blah, you know where that's going.

32:17.014 --> 32:18.415
[SPEAKER_00]: Excuse me, that's actually crap.

32:19.591 --> 32:22.633
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you bring up something the exact opposite on a previous show?

32:22.653 --> 32:29.819
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, first of all, the Department of Justice has proven that there has been... We're actually at a 30-year all-time low in violence among youth.

32:30.459 --> 32:31.020
[SPEAKER_00]: First of all.

32:32.461 --> 32:36.024
[SPEAKER_03]: Secondly... Is that just because all the kids are killing each other, so there's less to commit crimes?

32:36.064 --> 32:36.204
[SPEAKER_00]: No.

32:36.244 --> 32:36.904
[SPEAKER_00]: Kidding, kidding.

32:37.024 --> 32:47.232
[SPEAKER_00]: It takes... But it would have to take some sort of really fucked-up-in-the-head child to just go out and say, Oh, I play Unreal Tournament.

32:47.252 --> 32:49.114
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to go kill everybody in my school.

32:51.982 --> 32:57.286
[SPEAKER_00]: And on one little thing, the comment about common sense, I do think common sense did prevail.

32:58.727 --> 32:59.347
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, snap.

33:01.529 --> 33:04.111
[SPEAKER_04]: We've had this debate for the past six months, so I'm almost a little done with it.

33:04.351 --> 33:09.814
[SPEAKER_04]: But my biggest issue with the California law was the fact that it didn't set a clear regulation.

33:09.834 --> 33:13.417
[SPEAKER_04]: It seemed like the bill was open to a lot of interpretation, so I hope if it is...

33:14.164 --> 33:25.056
[SPEAKER_04]: Going back to the drawing board, I hope that's what they work on is some type of clear set guideline, some type of third-party board reviews these games and gives them the rating, whatever, just, you know,

33:26.610 --> 33:28.691
[SPEAKER_04]: As I've said many times before, they should be done just like movies.

33:28.991 --> 33:29.511
[SPEAKER_04]: What's the big deal?

33:29.591 --> 33:31.731
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that's how they are done in Europe.

33:32.691 --> 33:33.892
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I'm disappointed about?

33:34.112 --> 33:34.292
[SPEAKER_00]: What?

33:34.452 --> 33:35.272
[SPEAKER_02]: Arnold Schwarzenegger.

33:35.712 --> 33:35.992
[SPEAKER_02]: Really?

33:36.112 --> 33:37.112
[SPEAKER_02]: What is the problem with him?

33:37.453 --> 33:41.353
[SPEAKER_02]: Would the Terminator let a law like this be appealed so simply?

33:41.754 --> 33:45.955
[SPEAKER_02]: No, the Terminator would go out and kill the bastards that try to appeal this law.

33:46.895 --> 33:49.855
[SPEAKER_02]: Arnold Schwarzenegger should be just ruling California with an iron fist.

33:51.436 --> 33:53.376
[SPEAKER_02]: Either that or he should quit and go back to movies again.

33:54.257 --> 33:55.777
[SPEAKER_03]: Can we switch topics, please?

33:56.980 --> 34:00.663
[SPEAKER_00]: Please, just because I think he's so pathetic that he's not going to get reelected, but still.

34:00.984 --> 34:04.367
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, you can send those cards and letters to DarkSakura, care of Orange Lounge Radio.

34:05.408 --> 34:07.169
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, to go at OrangeLoungeRadio.com, actually.

34:07.350 --> 34:07.730
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

34:08.591 --> 34:09.972
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, send those flowers.

34:10.913 --> 34:11.473
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, let's see.

34:11.754 --> 34:19.181
[SPEAKER_00]: That's okay, because I'm already going to go buy an island when I'm rich and infamous and create DarkSakura land.

34:20.293 --> 34:24.418
[SPEAKER_00]: Where I'm, you know, goddess of the island Where King Kong lives No!

34:24.798 --> 34:36.211
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't like big hairy apes And bad adaptations of movies Moving on, moving on This is the week, of course, where everybody's gotta whip out their best of the year list, right?

34:36.820 --> 34:44.404
[SPEAKER_04]: because, you know, we're in that time where it's almost the first of 2006, so everybody, I don't know, we feel this need in our society to rank things.

34:44.424 --> 34:46.425
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, we've got to have a frickin' best game of the year.

34:46.785 --> 34:48.946
[SPEAKER_04]: So, of course, some of the game sites are getting in on the fun.

34:49.546 --> 34:53.068
[SPEAKER_04]: GameSpy has released their list of the top ten games of the year.

34:53.148 --> 34:53.608
[SPEAKER_04]: Here they are.

34:54.229 --> 34:57.270
[SPEAKER_04]: Ten, Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell Chaos Theory on Xbox.

34:58.011 --> 35:00.872
[SPEAKER_04]: Nine, Legend of Zelda The Minish Cap, Game Boy Advance.

35:01.752 --> 35:04.634
[SPEAKER_04]: Eight, Dragon Quest VIII, Journey of the Cursed King, PlayStation 2.

35:06.299 --> 35:21.846
[SPEAKER_04]: 7, Half-Life 2 on the Xbox, 6, Battlefield 2 on the PC, 5, Call of Duty 2 on the Xbox 360, 4, Mario Kart DS on the Nintendo DS, 3, God of War on the PlayStation 2, 2, Resident Evil 4 on the GameCube, and 1, Civ 4 on the PC.

35:21.906 --> 35:23.147
[SPEAKER_04]: It was their number one game of the year.

35:24.027 --> 35:27.189
[SPEAKER_04]: GameSpot also did their Game of the Year, but they do it a little differently.

35:27.209 --> 35:29.410
[SPEAKER_04]: They nominate and then they name one as the Game of the Year.

35:29.950 --> 35:44.598
[SPEAKER_04]: Nominated, they nominated Battlefield 2, Civilization 4, FEAR, Forza Motorsport, God of War, Guild Wars, Guitar Hero, Mario Kart DS, Ninja Gaiden Black, and the winner was Resident Evil 4 on the GameCube.

35:45.218 --> 36:01.575
[SPEAKER_04]: So, I thought we could get in on the fun, but you know what guys, I don't like, say, I don't want to name the best game of the year, because, you know what, we're just, we're gamers, and you're gonna disagree with us no matter what we say, so we're gonna say our favorite game of 2005, and try to stay away from that whole controversial best of thing, because...

36:01.875 --> 36:04.937
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, even though we like to think we're important, we know we're not.

36:05.037 --> 36:07.578
[SPEAKER_04]: So, what were our favorite games of 2005?

36:07.678 --> 36:10.379
[SPEAKER_04]: I just want to know a runner-up and a best of and why.

36:10.459 --> 36:12.701
[SPEAKER_04]: So, Loki, your runner-up for best game of 2005.

36:13.061 --> 36:18.143
[SPEAKER_02]: My runner-up for best game of 2005 would be Burnout Legend.

36:18.263 --> 36:19.344
[SPEAKER_02]: Or Burnout Revenge, actually.

36:19.464 --> 36:20.364
[SPEAKER_02]: Screw Burnout Legends.

36:20.404 --> 36:21.465
[SPEAKER_02]: Burnout Legends sucked.

36:22.365 --> 36:23.226
[SPEAKER_02]: Burnout Revenge.

36:23.666 --> 36:26.728
[SPEAKER_02]: I played that game non-stop for months.

36:27.388 --> 36:29.109
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just really fun.

36:29.500 --> 36:36.266
[SPEAKER_02]: The only thing it lacked was good single-player mode, but it's just really fun, and I'm really looking forward to Burnout Revenge when it comes out in the 360.

36:37.947 --> 36:40.950
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course, my top game for... No, no, no.

36:40.970 --> 36:41.951
[SPEAKER_04]: Hold still.

36:42.011 --> 36:43.072
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to do my runner-up, too.

36:45.434 --> 36:46.495
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, let's see.

36:46.615 --> 36:55.303
[SPEAKER_04]: My runner-up for best game of the year, I would say probably the runner-up I would call best game of the year would probably be... This is a tough one for me, and...

36:56.255 --> 37:07.867
[SPEAKER_04]: When you put this next to my game of the year, I'm going to get some interesting reactions, but I would say my runner-up for best game of the year would be Meteos on Nintendo DS because I thought it was such a great puzzler.

37:07.927 --> 37:14.994
[SPEAKER_04]: It really started the wave of great games coming out for the DS, and I thought it was a puzzler with a lot of replayability value to it.

37:15.475 --> 37:19.339
[SPEAKER_04]: But I've got to admit, as far as DS goes, this is a very close call for me with Mario Kart DS.

37:19.679 --> 37:48.002
[SPEAKER_04]: but my problem with Mario Kart DS is that it did feel a little bit rushed and I don't think the online was polished enough for me to really consider it a game of the year title but I do acknowledge that Nintendo has made leaps and bounds in that whole online world thing and I think Mario Kart set a great precedent but I don't think I could call it my favorite game of the year because Meteos got a lot more play for me so Meteos would be my runner up for game of the year DarkSakura, you're runner up for game of the year Animal Crossing Animal Crossing DS, why?

37:49.581 --> 37:52.063
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know, it's just I play it every day.

37:53.084 --> 37:59.571
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the first game that I have, even when I was so busy with school, I've made time for it every day.

38:00.512 --> 38:00.772
[SPEAKER_04]: Awesome.

38:01.032 --> 38:02.994
[SPEAKER_00]: So it definitely gets it.

38:03.415 --> 38:03.835
[SPEAKER_04]: Sounds good.

38:04.176 --> 38:05.056
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki, game of the year.

38:05.657 --> 38:07.559
[SPEAKER_02]: My game of the year is just

38:08.072 --> 38:10.535
[SPEAKER_02]: Grand Theft Auto Liberty City Stories

38:31.192 --> 38:31.533
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura,

38:45.001 --> 38:50.844
[SPEAKER_04]: I haven't seen this get a lot of, it got a lot of critical acclaim when it first came out, but it's noticeably absent from a lot of these top game of the year lists.

38:51.224 --> 38:54.186
[SPEAKER_04]: And honestly, this was a game that sold systems.

38:54.466 --> 38:55.666
[SPEAKER_04]: This was a system seller.

38:55.927 --> 38:57.307
[SPEAKER_04]: This was an amazing game.

38:57.647 --> 39:00.969
[SPEAKER_04]: It revolutionized an entire genre of game.

39:01.409 --> 39:10.654
[SPEAKER_04]: And I realize this is going to sound a little weird when you put it next to my runner-up, but, because the fact that they were both made by the same company, but my runner-up is really the game that I played a heck of a lot of.

39:10.994 --> 39:15.118
[SPEAKER_04]: But my game of the year is something I got to recognize as being like it really pushed the bar.

39:15.559 --> 39:18.401
[SPEAKER_04]: Luminous for the PSP is absolutely my favorite game that came out this year.

39:19.222 --> 39:22.845
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's the reason to have a PSP for me.

39:23.306 --> 39:23.806
[SPEAKER_04]: It really is.

39:23.886 --> 39:28.891
[SPEAKER_04]: And I know I sound like a total puzzle game addict when you put those two side by side, but they really did.

39:29.151 --> 39:30.973
[SPEAKER_04]: They pushed the bar in different ways for their systems.

39:31.013 --> 39:34.316
[SPEAKER_04]: And this really was considered, we're looking at the year of the...

39:35.177 --> 39:35.557
[SPEAKER_04]: and DarkSakura.

39:56.044 --> 39:58.066
[SPEAKER_00]: Recycle, recycle, recycle Oh, let's not do MIDI this time

40:25.578 --> 40:29.061
[SPEAKER_00]: But Guitar Freaks actually makes it feel like you're playing a guitar.

40:29.162 --> 40:38.430
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought it was very, very cool of Red Octane to come out to my house and say, here, you can play Guitar Freaks in your living room on TV.

40:39.351 --> 40:46.298
[SPEAKER_00]: And I thought that that was really cool that they put that time and effort into it to try to make it something that...

40:47.219 --> 40:53.164
[SPEAKER_00]: The people would want to play, instead of just saying, oh, well, we're doing something like Guitar Freaks.

40:53.364 --> 40:53.904
[SPEAKER_00]: No, no, no, no.

40:54.364 --> 40:56.446
[SPEAKER_00]: They innovated on it, and I thought that was pretty cool.

40:57.447 --> 40:57.947
[SPEAKER_04]: There you have it.

40:57.987 --> 41:02.130
[SPEAKER_04]: Our picks for Games of the Year 2005.

41:02.230 --> 41:03.131
[SPEAKER_04]: Our picks.

41:03.171 --> 41:03.612
[SPEAKER_04]: There you have it.

41:03.712 --> 41:04.012
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

41:04.672 --> 41:05.273
[SPEAKER_04]: Moving on.

41:05.333 --> 41:08.175
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's talk about DarkSakura.

41:08.195 --> 41:12.098
[SPEAKER_04]: You had an interesting kind of feature story about innovation in the scene.

41:12.138 --> 41:13.159
[SPEAKER_04]: What's this all about?

41:13.760 --> 41:21.662
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, speaking of innovation, there's an article up on GameSpot that I thought was pretty interesting.

41:21.762 --> 41:28.844
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, it was one that a friend of mine who's a game tester referred me to, and I thought that it was pretty interesting.

41:30.904 --> 41:43.147
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, there's not so much of a lack of innovation as much as a lack of wanting to use that innovation that's going out, you know?

41:45.549 --> 41:48.090
[SPEAKER_00]: There's actually a very good quote in here.

41:48.810 --> 41:52.151
[SPEAKER_00]: This is, innovation is dead, dying.

41:52.211 --> 41:58.853
[SPEAKER_00]: Every once in a while, somebody will slip something in that will shock us, but for the most part, there's no money in innovation, even if it's great.

41:59.413 --> 42:06.395
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, the industry is really looking for what do people already like, and can we make a sequel?

42:07.456 --> 42:10.178
[SPEAKER_00]: We are seeing such sequel-intensive titles now.

42:10.718 --> 42:13.100
[SPEAKER_00]: We see more Halos, more Metal Gear.

42:14.662 --> 42:18.125
[SPEAKER_00]: Instead, what was the last really innovative game that we got?

42:18.585 --> 42:21.768
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, Luminous I thought was very good, but it's still a puzzle game.

42:22.982 --> 42:25.984
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, Katamari Damacy now, that was innovation.

42:26.425 --> 42:27.906
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, we got a sequel this year.

42:27.926 --> 42:29.867
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's more of the same.

42:30.508 --> 42:31.248
[SPEAKER_04]: It is and it isn't.

42:31.308 --> 42:40.295
[SPEAKER_04]: It did expand on it, but I couldn't name Katamari Damacy or We Heart Katamari my game of the year because you're right, it wasn't as innovative as the first time you saw it, you know what I mean?

42:40.775 --> 42:52.429
[SPEAKER_00]: The best business for a publisher is to give people what you know they want.

42:52.950 --> 42:57.255
[SPEAKER_00]: And what you know they want is a sequel to what they won last time, so we don't see a whole lot of innovation.

42:57.675 --> 42:58.796
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what's interesting, DarkSakura?

42:58.836 --> 43:03.659
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm actually, as you're saying this and talking about sequels and everything, I'm looking at GameSpice Top 10, just up top of my head here.

43:04.159 --> 43:12.405
[SPEAKER_04]: Out of these 10 games on the list, only one of them is not a sequel or some type of story continuation type thing, like a...

43:13.465 --> 43:15.707
[SPEAKER_04]: Tom Clancy, Splinter Cell, Chaos Theory.

43:16.047 --> 43:18.608
[SPEAKER_04]: Only one of these games, God of War, is a new title.

43:18.628 --> 43:24.051
[SPEAKER_00]: There's another good quote from him in here, and this actually makes a lot of sense because I was just discussing this with somebody the other day.

43:24.111 --> 43:29.594
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't just with my husband, it was with a couple other people because Dan and I talk games all the time.

43:30.955 --> 43:36.378
[SPEAKER_00]: It's another one from him that says, the problem I have with the whole sequel thing is it's not just sequels.

43:36.958 --> 43:40.364
[SPEAKER_00]: It's once we see that World War II combat shooters work, we've got 50 of them.

43:40.724 --> 43:45.572
[SPEAKER_00]: The funny thing is that the next year after we saw that, everyone thought if World War II worked, Vietnam would work too.

43:45.953 --> 43:47.435
[SPEAKER_00]: But all those games were a disaster.

43:47.535 --> 43:50.240
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we've got how many more World War II games coming out?

43:51.766 --> 43:58.231
[SPEAKER_00]: So we see them trying to go on the same path and then it going, no, no, no, we like this.

43:58.951 --> 44:10.739
[SPEAKER_00]: So on top of that, it's not necessarily that there's not a willingness to innovate as much as there's not a willingness of the consumer base to test an innovative product.

44:11.721 --> 44:12.482
[SPEAKER_02]: Civil War First Person Shooter

44:32.345 --> 44:46.291
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, what do you think, I got a question for you, what do you think of Nintendo's sort of response to this whole thing, is this kind of like, Nintendo kind of sees, well, if the games aren't innovating, let's innovate the system, and kind of

44:46.829 --> 44:47.569
[SPEAKER_04]: See what happens.

44:47.949 --> 44:49.270
[SPEAKER_00]: See, they're taking a big risk.

44:49.410 --> 44:51.150
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that's what I say, too, is they're taking a big risk.

44:51.230 --> 44:54.751
[SPEAKER_00]: Nintendo, when you are Nintendo, you can do no wrong.

44:55.491 --> 44:56.472
[SPEAKER_04]: Virtually wrong.

44:57.132 --> 45:02.653
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, but the thing is that I think that they're really resting on their lulls quite a bit.

45:02.913 --> 45:04.594
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, hey, we're Nintendo.

45:04.634 --> 45:06.594
[SPEAKER_00]: We can get away with this crap, and you'll like it.

45:06.754 --> 45:08.315
[SPEAKER_00]: Because we said so, because we're Nintendo.

45:08.956 --> 45:17.959
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you think it's one of those things where Nintendo's sort of like, they're going to try this out, but even if they fail miserably, they can always turn the controller sideways and it's just like any other console.

45:17.979 --> 45:19.280
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what they're going to do?

45:19.300 --> 45:22.601
[SPEAKER_00]: I see them pulling an Xbox.

45:23.381 --> 45:24.661
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, you don't like this controller?

45:24.721 --> 45:25.562
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's another one.

45:26.162 --> 45:29.023
[SPEAKER_00]: You know when we got the controller S and now it's almost the standard?

45:29.778 --> 45:31.439
[SPEAKER_04]: Interesting, yeah, true, true.

45:31.459 --> 45:41.463
[SPEAKER_00]: The controller S that we got over here was the same one released with the Japanese systems, which I knew people freaking importing that controller because it's so much more comfortable than the Humongoid controller.

45:42.423 --> 45:44.124
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry, I got these little small fingers.

45:44.704 --> 45:45.965
[SPEAKER_00]: I wouldn't touch our Xbox.

45:46.005 --> 45:53.908
[SPEAKER_00]: So the whole thing is that now, I think that's what's going to happen with Nintendo is that people are going to go, oh, this controller is kind of stupid.

45:54.571 --> 45:55.331
[SPEAKER_00]: We want a real one.

45:56.252 --> 45:56.972
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know, again.

45:57.332 --> 45:58.852
[SPEAKER_00]: More money in the Nintendo pocket.

45:59.332 --> 46:05.935
[SPEAKER_04]: But if they put out the Zelda games and the Mario games, which you could question, is that really innovative?

46:06.235 --> 46:10.516
[SPEAKER_04]: But if they put that kind of stuff out with a controller and it does well, who knows?

46:11.096 --> 46:16.938
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I think that there's a very good example in here, though, of innovative projects that they've proven have worked.

46:17.258 --> 46:17.838
[SPEAKER_00]: Psychonauts.

46:19.719 --> 46:23.700
[SPEAKER_00]: Where it was officially going to be an Xbox exclusive and Microsoft dropped it.

46:25.541 --> 46:28.203
[SPEAKER_00]: They went to all over the place.

46:28.783 --> 46:30.765
[SPEAKER_00]: And Majesco, of course, picked it up.

46:31.485 --> 46:33.766
[SPEAKER_00]: The game was released on Xbox, PC, PS2.

46:34.567 --> 46:37.749
[SPEAKER_00]: I think one of the ones that's listed in here that they went to was Vivendi.

46:38.349 --> 46:42.291
[SPEAKER_00]: And they said they were interested in it, but said it was too risky.

46:42.852 --> 46:46.394
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's been one of the... I haven't played enough of that game to really know.

46:46.554 --> 46:47.655
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't honestly played much.

46:47.895 --> 46:51.477
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been considering it just because I've heard how neat it is, but...

46:52.059 --> 46:57.161
[SPEAKER_00]: But still, I mean, you know, it's also, though, why we don't get a lot of the really awesome Japanese games, I think.

46:57.961 --> 47:01.863
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we never got, what, we never got, what, Psychic Force over here?

47:01.903 --> 47:03.583
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, we damn near didn't get Katamari Damashii.

47:03.703 --> 47:05.144
[SPEAKER_04]: We didn't get Oz over here.

47:05.404 --> 47:05.584
[SPEAKER_00]: No.

47:06.084 --> 47:06.344
[SPEAKER_04]: So.

47:06.824 --> 47:10.025
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and on top of that, I think that's why it's taken so long for us to get DDR.

47:10.466 --> 47:11.366
[SPEAKER_00]: Why it's taken us so long.

47:11.606 --> 47:14.447
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, we're just now getting Beatmania, and how long has it been out in Japan?

47:15.247 --> 47:15.948
[SPEAKER_04]: Ninety, well.

47:15.968 --> 47:16.228
[SPEAKER_04]: Ninety-three.

47:16.608 --> 47:16.928
[SPEAKER_00]: Ninety-three.

47:17.779 --> 47:18.399
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, a long time.

47:18.679 --> 47:19.580
[SPEAKER_04]: No, not that long.

47:19.880 --> 47:20.060
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.

47:20.700 --> 47:21.000
[SPEAKER_04]: Really?

47:21.521 --> 47:21.781
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

47:22.201 --> 47:22.681
[SPEAKER_04]: It's been a while.

47:22.741 --> 47:23.482
[SPEAKER_04]: Geez.

47:23.542 --> 47:26.163
[SPEAKER_04]: No, because the first mix was on PlayStation.

47:26.183 --> 47:27.643
[SPEAKER_04]: PlayStation was... Oh, shit, maybe.

47:27.824 --> 47:28.324
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, anyway.

47:28.344 --> 47:29.164
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, whatever.

47:29.204 --> 47:29.844
[SPEAKER_04]: So a long time.

47:30.485 --> 47:33.666
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, keep in mind that the PlayStation was released in Japan in 93.

47:34.487 --> 47:34.807
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

47:35.227 --> 47:38.308
[SPEAKER_00]: Because we had mine in my dorm room in 94, and it was new.

47:38.868 --> 47:40.869
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow, wow, wow, wow.

47:41.029 --> 47:41.870
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's just been...

47:42.805 --> 47:44.305
[SPEAKER_00]: It takes forever for us to get anything.

47:44.465 --> 47:51.427
[SPEAKER_00]: And their market, I think, is always looking for something new and fresh and something different because there's so much that's homogenous in their society.

47:51.647 --> 47:58.149
[SPEAKER_04]: Do we have a skewed perspective, though, because we happen to be fans of those types of games, but maybe those games aren't really the ones that sell here?

47:58.209 --> 48:04.991
[SPEAKER_04]: Because when you look at the American market, despite our distaste towards these games, it is all about Madden.

48:05.563 --> 48:07.965
[SPEAKER_04]: and NBA Live and all that stuff.

48:08.405 --> 48:15.190
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that why we... I honestly think that the average American has too narrow a scope to look for anything new and different beyond what they already know.

48:16.511 --> 48:20.614
[SPEAKER_04]: Again, those cards and letters can go to... I said average.

48:20.874 --> 48:21.094
[SPEAKER_04]: I know.

48:21.374 --> 48:26.078
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you listen to this show, you've already demonstrated... You've already demonstrated that you have impeccable taste.

48:27.192 --> 48:28.774
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, we've got to move on to another story.

48:28.794 --> 48:30.495
[SPEAKER_04]: Where was this again?

48:30.655 --> 48:32.337
[SPEAKER_00]: I think this might be a good read.

48:32.377 --> 48:33.698
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll go ahead and give out the URL.

48:33.738 --> 48:40.784
[SPEAKER_00]: It's at gamespot.com slash news slash 6141519 dot html.

48:41.604 --> 48:42.445
[SPEAKER_00]: Very good article.

48:42.465 --> 48:44.226
[SPEAKER_00]: I suggest everyone give it a thorough reading.

48:44.907 --> 48:46.588
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, now let's counterbalance.

48:47.109 --> 48:52.193
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura has given us something very thoughtful and very good brain stimulant.

48:52.533 --> 48:55.676
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's go to the complete opposite end of the spectrum and talk about Jack Thompson.

48:57.620 --> 49:05.242
[SPEAKER_04]: Jack Thompson has bought stock in Take-Two Interactive, who publishes rockstar games like The Warriors and Grand Theft Auto San Andreas.

49:05.602 --> 49:08.742
[SPEAKER_04]: Why the hell would he do this when this is his main enemy, DarkSakura?

49:08.982 --> 49:10.122
[SPEAKER_04]: I know exactly why.

49:10.142 --> 49:10.483
[SPEAKER_00]: What's he doing?

49:10.603 --> 49:14.083
[SPEAKER_00]: We brought up something on the live show about people complaining about Konami.

49:14.623 --> 49:19.604
[SPEAKER_00]: He wants, as a stockholder, he has the right to challenge any business decision of the company.

49:20.204 --> 49:21.405
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's exactly what he's doing.

49:21.425 --> 49:23.025
[SPEAKER_04]: He wants to be able to go to stockholder meetings.

49:24.534 --> 49:28.959
[SPEAKER_00]: I have to say, as much as I loathe the man, that's freaking brilliant.

49:28.979 --> 49:30.500
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what's also brilliant?

49:30.801 --> 49:36.887
[SPEAKER_02]: The fact that he hasn't re-registered his site, StopKill.com, which, by the way, domain is up for auction right now.

49:37.288 --> 49:39.771
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you've got $60, you can actually go bid on it.

49:42.096 --> 49:44.518
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for watching!

50:07.344 --> 50:08.024
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, we'll see.

50:08.064 --> 50:10.465
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the sound of my wallet and zipping.

50:10.485 --> 50:11.386
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll see what happens.

50:11.426 --> 50:12.126
[SPEAKER_04]: More to come on that.

50:12.186 --> 50:14.247
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, we'll talk offline about that.

50:14.667 --> 50:20.209
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, what I thought was interesting, there's a little dig here at Microsoft CEO Bill Gates.

50:20.849 --> 50:21.550
[SPEAKER_04]: What's next?

50:21.610 --> 50:25.991
[SPEAKER_04]: A game in which players can practice flying commercial jetliners into the world trade towers?

50:26.391 --> 50:26.972
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I forgot.

50:27.032 --> 50:28.412
[SPEAKER_04]: Microsoft already did that.

50:28.512 --> 50:30.413
[SPEAKER_04]: Bank Times Man of the Year, Bill Gates.

50:31.693 --> 50:33.054
[SPEAKER_04]: Which I think is kind of a low blow.

50:33.114 --> 50:35.235
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, come on.

50:36.650 --> 50:38.272
[SPEAKER_02]: This is my open letter to Jack Thompson.

50:38.292 --> 50:38.452
[SPEAKER_02]: Give up.

50:38.492 --> 50:40.094
[SPEAKER_02]: Please, just give up.

50:40.154 --> 50:42.337
[SPEAKER_02]: People are laughing at you.

50:54.966 --> 51:00.352
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki, you had a story about In the Groove, because we were talking about Guitar Hero earlier.

51:00.392 --> 51:04.636
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's talk about Red Octane's other music game that wasn't quite as critically acclaimed, but what's going on with In the Groove?

51:04.816 --> 51:06.538
[SPEAKER_02]: In the Groove is coming to the PC.

51:08.171 --> 51:09.291
[SPEAKER_02]: More info coming soon in thegroove.com

51:33.362 --> 51:45.291
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, for those people actually still playing Step Mania, or as I like to call it, In The Groove 3, you can actually download a brand new build of Step Mania 4.0, which isn't finalized yet.

51:45.531 --> 51:52.416
[SPEAKER_02]: But anyways, this one has ParaPara support, which you can actually use the Japanese controller with, the USB one.

51:52.716 --> 51:54.438
[SPEAKER_02]: And they've got some test songs on there as well.

51:54.518 --> 51:56.579
[SPEAKER_02]: So definitely worth checking out.

51:56.599 --> 51:58.541
[SPEAKER_02]: You can find all that at stepmania.com.

51:59.141 --> 52:02.704
[SPEAKER_04]: Pada, pada, pada dice, because you don't look fruity enough playing DDR.

52:03.402 --> 52:03.922
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly.

52:04.143 --> 52:06.504
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, we've seen Fruity on that game.

52:07.065 --> 52:07.645
[SPEAKER_04]: I know, I know.

52:08.606 --> 52:12.609
[SPEAKER_04]: Drunken parties where people are putting on their girlfriends' clothing.

52:13.669 --> 52:17.233
[SPEAKER_04]: Moving on, before we get letters about that, let's talk about letters, DarkSakura.

52:17.273 --> 52:18.695
[SPEAKER_04]: What the hell's in our mailbag this week?

52:19.135 --> 52:25.722
[SPEAKER_04]: If you want to send fan letters or hate letters or letters that encourage stimulating conversation or news tips.

52:25.762 --> 52:28.045
[SPEAKER_04]: We have an awful lot of news tips from our buddy Rob.

52:28.926 --> 52:30.367
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me guess, do we have a Rob mail this week?

52:30.407 --> 52:32.590
[SPEAKER_00]: We actually did get a Rob mail, but I've already covered it.

52:34.091 --> 52:36.172
[SPEAKER_00]: Pulled that up from one of the sites that I review already.

52:36.793 --> 52:39.334
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, no, I haven't done it yet.

52:39.394 --> 52:40.675
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an article I'd already pulled up.

52:40.695 --> 52:40.935
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry.

52:41.035 --> 52:42.236
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, but you were going to cover it.

52:42.276 --> 52:42.976
[SPEAKER_00]: I was going to cover it.

52:42.996 --> 52:43.596
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, shit.

52:43.616 --> 52:44.117
[SPEAKER_04]: Go for it.

52:44.157 --> 52:44.437
[SPEAKER_04]: Why not?

52:44.457 --> 52:51.101
[SPEAKER_00]: About Ubisoft working with Taito to release Exit for the PSP.

52:52.161 --> 52:54.403
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a puzzle action game.

52:54.443 --> 52:55.483
[SPEAKER_00]: Looks like Oddworld 2.

52:56.444 --> 53:00.826
[SPEAKER_00]: But I got my news from a different source than what he linked to me.

53:01.046 --> 53:02.347
[SPEAKER_00]: Gotcha.

53:02.407 --> 53:03.308
[SPEAKER_00]: Just to give a little...

53:04.801 --> 53:18.855
[SPEAKER_00]: Background for this story, players control an escapologist called Mr. ESC, like your escape button, and must guide him around obstacles while rescuing people, you know, you have fires, earthquakes, stuff like that.

53:19.656 --> 53:23.220
[SPEAKER_00]: A hundred different scenarios, downloadable content also made available.

53:25.199 --> 53:28.701
[SPEAKER_00]: Exit's also going along just for our European listeners.

53:28.761 --> 53:41.088
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be... They're saying that it's going to fit in very well with some of the games being released like Frantics and Grip Shift, which is a puzzle driving game.

53:41.369 --> 53:42.709
[SPEAKER_00]: Cool.

53:43.610 --> 53:47.953
[SPEAKER_00]: Just a couple other of the emails received as soon as I poo them up.

53:48.153 --> 53:49.314
[SPEAKER_00]: One of our new listeners, Mason...

53:50.848 --> 53:52.970
[SPEAKER_00]: who I think has just the most awesome email ever.

53:52.990 --> 53:55.111
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to give it out, but yeah, I like donuts too.

53:56.853 --> 54:04.098
[SPEAKER_00]: So he imported Guitar Freak's controller and a copy of Guitar Freak's fourth Mexican game.

54:04.478 --> 54:05.339
[SPEAKER_00]: His controller broke.

54:05.699 --> 54:08.702
[SPEAKER_00]: Honestly, third-party controllers, never buy them.

54:09.302 --> 54:11.504
[SPEAKER_00]: Hello, get the Konami controller, sorry.

54:11.644 --> 54:16.227
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what's really interesting, you know, if you want to go into history, is that who was making most of the third-party controllers for Guitar Freak's?

54:16.668 --> 54:17.268
[SPEAKER_04]: Red Octane.

54:17.508 --> 54:18.509
[SPEAKER_04]: What's their bread and butter now?

54:19.073 --> 54:19.473
[SPEAKER_04]: Guitar Hero.

54:39.778 --> 54:41.059
[SPEAKER_00]: Guitar Hero is worth the money that you'll spend on it.

54:41.139 --> 54:42.440
[SPEAKER_04]: On top of that, if you're going to play Guitar Freaks...

55:07.323 --> 55:13.787
[SPEAKER_00]: I know of sites I will tell you via email where I do my ordering from because I don't want to, unless they want to pay us.

55:14.987 --> 55:20.230
[SPEAKER_00]: But I ordered both of my controllers for very reasonable, although they're a lot harder to get now.

55:20.350 --> 55:21.850
[SPEAKER_00]: And Guitar Hero has Freeze Pop.

55:21.990 --> 55:22.551
[SPEAKER_00]: Freeze Pop!

55:22.711 --> 55:23.551
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, they have Freeze Pop.

55:23.971 --> 55:28.774
[SPEAKER_00]: And also it's kind of funny if you can go back and watch the making of movies, they're really fun.

55:30.396 --> 55:30.936
[SPEAKER_04]: Any other emails?

55:31.537 --> 55:31.717
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.

55:34.159 --> 55:49.610
[SPEAKER_00]: Rodney, it says Roddycat, has sent us an email saying about how Sega, mentioning back to our Sega making a classic game story, and he's thinking it's Alex Kidd.

55:51.952 --> 55:53.053
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

55:53.513 --> 55:56.675
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, well, it's not quite running good.

55:56.856 --> 55:58.597
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a franchise that I think should be revived.

56:00.051 --> 56:09.415
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, actually, my favorite ever game for the Master System, next to, of course, Fantasy Zone, because I'm a big Fantasy Zone whore.

56:09.616 --> 56:10.136
[SPEAKER_04]: Space Harrier?

56:11.116 --> 56:12.617
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, yeah, Space Harrier.

56:13.157 --> 56:17.219
[SPEAKER_00]: But I mean, like, I really love Alex Kidd and Shinobi World.

56:18.540 --> 56:19.780
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just fun.

56:19.840 --> 56:25.083
[SPEAKER_04]: For me, this was more a Genesis thing, but it's got to be Altered Beast.

56:25.103 --> 56:26.724
[SPEAKER_04]: Rise from your grave.

56:26.824 --> 56:27.064
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway.

56:28.615 --> 56:37.528
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and also we got kudos from our Mac Man for reading his last letter on air.

56:38.069 --> 56:41.174
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to say hi again, Mac Man.

56:42.529 --> 56:46.872
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you want to get said hi to on the air, it's 2go at orangelawntrader.com is our email address.

56:46.892 --> 56:47.732
[SPEAKER_00]: He cracked me up.

56:47.812 --> 56:52.615
[SPEAKER_00]: He said, Macman equals I who have superb taste in computers.

56:55.737 --> 56:56.978
[SPEAKER_00]: Any rebuttal from Loki?

56:56.998 --> 56:57.538
[SPEAKER_00]: Loki rebuttal?

56:57.919 --> 56:58.239
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

56:58.779 --> 56:58.939
[SPEAKER_04]: Huh?

56:59.399 --> 56:59.700
[SPEAKER_04]: Forget it.

56:59.760 --> 57:03.222
[SPEAKER_00]: It's from Macman, our Mac player guy.

57:03.282 --> 57:05.543
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki's looking at porn on the other computer or something.

57:05.563 --> 57:08.165
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, we lost Loki now for minutes on end.

57:08.516 --> 57:10.397
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm looking at info, okay?

57:11.198 --> 57:11.738
[SPEAKER_04]: About porn.

57:11.759 --> 57:12.159
[SPEAKER_04]: About porn.

57:12.179 --> 57:13.180
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not about porn.

57:13.660 --> 57:17.723
[SPEAKER_02]: However, though, there is a game coming out that I really do want to check out.

57:17.763 --> 57:33.235
[SPEAKER_02]: This is coming out for our European audience, which was actually already released before as the simple 2000 series volume 50, the Daiboujin, which is going to be re-released as Demolition Girl.

57:33.575 --> 57:37.138
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a game where you fly around in a helicopter and you attack 50-foot women.

57:38.325 --> 57:40.547
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know, that just appeals to me in some way.

57:41.147 --> 57:43.329
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki, Loki, mailbag, mailbag time.

57:43.389 --> 57:44.550
[SPEAKER_04]: Your time later, mailbag time.

57:44.990 --> 57:45.771
[SPEAKER_06]: Actually, I'm done.

57:45.891 --> 57:46.251
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, that's it.

57:46.291 --> 57:46.772
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, never mind.

57:47.112 --> 57:48.433
[SPEAKER_04]: Anything else then about The Demolition Girl?

57:49.234 --> 57:50.295
[SPEAKER_04]: Does it have Daryl Hannah in it?

57:50.315 --> 57:57.480
[SPEAKER_02]: It does not have Daryl Hannah in it, but it's actually being released in Europe as a budget title, which is very interesting.

57:57.701 --> 57:59.722
[SPEAKER_02]: Definitely need to check it out, among other games.

58:00.863 --> 58:02.865
[SPEAKER_02]: Kingdom Hearts 2, which I'll be playing probably this week.

58:02.925 --> 58:04.406
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, Kingdom Hearts 2!

58:05.187 --> 58:09.070
[SPEAKER_00]: I watched the ending because I'm bad.

58:09.911 --> 58:10.771
[SPEAKER_00]: I am so awful.

58:11.352 --> 58:15.996
[SPEAKER_00]: And the ending leaves me with many more questions than anything else I've seen on the internet.

58:16.036 --> 58:18.598
[SPEAKER_04]: So in other words, it's inevitable there's going to be a Kingdom Hearts 3.

58:19.519 --> 58:20.499
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know, actually.

58:20.519 --> 58:20.820
[SPEAKER_00]: 3 and 4.

58:21.480 --> 58:23.782
[SPEAKER_00]: But Jamie needs this game now.

58:23.862 --> 58:25.063
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm freaking tempted to import it.

58:26.853 --> 58:28.954
[SPEAKER_00]: Except I don't know, I can't read Japanese very well.

58:29.494 --> 58:38.057
[SPEAKER_04]: This is a good plug for our live station which runs music from games 24 hours a day, 7 days a week at OrangeLunchRadio.com because we just put in rotation this week the theme from Kingdom Hearts 2.

58:38.197 --> 58:39.737
[SPEAKER_04]: It's Utada Hikaru with Passion.

58:42.658 --> 58:45.039
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course I picked like the worst clip from, let's try another clip.

58:53.567 --> 58:55.289
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, check that out over at OrangeLunchRadio.com.

58:55.309 --> 58:59.535
[SPEAKER_00]: That's in rotation now, so... I need that for one particular level, actually.

59:00.396 --> 59:01.237
[SPEAKER_00]: Freakin' Tron.

59:01.958 --> 59:02.939
[SPEAKER_04]: Freakin' Tron, I know.

59:02.959 --> 59:03.760
[SPEAKER_04]: That'd be awesome.

59:04.280 --> 59:05.902
[SPEAKER_04]: They put a Chicken Little level in there.

59:06.183 --> 59:07.865
[SPEAKER_02]: No, Chicken Little is not in there.

59:07.905 --> 59:08.486
[SPEAKER_02]: He's a summon.

59:09.444 --> 59:14.185
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, okay, because I saw that Zach Braff was doing the voice in the American version, because they released the voice.

59:14.285 --> 59:18.466
[SPEAKER_00]: That list is the one off of IMDb, and it is not correct.

59:18.626 --> 59:19.007
[SPEAKER_04]: Really?

59:19.747 --> 59:19.947
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh.

59:21.467 --> 59:27.829
[SPEAKER_00]: Do not trust anything that IMDb puts out as far as voice acting goes until the official list comes out.

59:27.849 --> 59:30.790
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that's because IMDb is user-powered, right?

59:31.230 --> 59:31.590
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.

59:32.430 --> 59:35.471
[SPEAKER_00]: And all they did was port over the actors who played them.

59:36.792 --> 59:40.594
[SPEAKER_00]: However, I do have a strong feeling that they are going to get Johnny Depp.

59:41.654 --> 59:42.114
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, we'll see.

59:42.975 --> 59:46.737
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and, and, and, there's also Steamboat Willie, lovely, so cute.

59:48.433 --> 59:54.635
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, let's go over to Loki who has a couple more stories for us about, well just clear us out whatever stories you got over there Loki.

59:54.695 --> 01:00:01.357
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, real quick, there was actually some really nice Christmas gifts that a few game publishers have been putting out.

01:00:02.178 --> 01:00:06.619
[SPEAKER_02]: These being in the form of new downloads for some games actually out there right now.

01:00:07.159 --> 01:00:11.481
[SPEAKER_02]: The first one starting off with the Xbox is they've actually got some map packs coming out.

01:00:11.994 --> 01:00:14.255
[SPEAKER_02]: for Star Wars Battlefront 2.

01:00:14.955 --> 01:00:18.336
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can get those actually available on Xbox Live.

01:00:19.036 --> 01:00:19.776
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're available.

01:00:20.016 --> 01:00:28.679
[SPEAKER_02]: They're going to be having another January pack coming out at about $5 featuring some more maps in there as well, which is pretty cool.

01:00:29.539 --> 01:00:32.600
[SPEAKER_02]: The other map pack that's coming out is actually for the PC.

01:00:33.160 --> 01:00:34.500
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's going to be for Quake 4.

01:00:34.800 --> 01:00:40.462
[SPEAKER_02]: And you've got three free maps that you can actually download on the official website idsoftware.com.

01:00:41.311 --> 01:00:43.718
[SPEAKER_02]: So definitely check those out if you play some Quake 4.

01:00:44.299 --> 01:00:45.001
[SPEAKER_02]: And then finally...

01:00:46.556 --> 01:00:49.478
[SPEAKER_02]: There was actually some for... Oh, no way.

01:00:49.578 --> 01:00:50.199
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, that was it.

01:00:50.659 --> 01:00:51.119
[SPEAKER_02]: My mistake.

01:00:51.159 --> 01:00:52.660
[SPEAKER_02]: I had two of the same story on there.

01:00:52.760 --> 01:00:57.424
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought you had a story about Walmart stockpiling 360s or something.

01:00:57.444 --> 01:01:05.409
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, Walmart's pulling a Best Buy, basically, and they're going to be doing a sale for New Year's, and they're stockpiling 360s, supposedly.

01:01:05.749 --> 01:01:06.150
[SPEAKER_02]: Interesting.

01:01:06.210 --> 01:01:11.653
[SPEAKER_02]: So definitely, if you haven't got a 360 yet, still interested in getting one, go check out your Walmart on New Year's Day.

01:01:12.014 --> 01:01:12.354
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

01:01:13.010 --> 01:01:23.999
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been hearing rumors that, and I can't say what my source is or where I got it from, but some of the game vendors are hoping to have their pre-orders filled by actually mid to end January.

01:01:24.499 --> 01:01:25.660
[SPEAKER_04]: That's good news for a lot of people.

01:01:25.880 --> 01:01:26.561
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's hope it's true.

01:01:27.762 --> 01:01:28.342
[SPEAKER_04]: Anything else, Loki?

01:01:29.683 --> 01:01:38.770
[SPEAKER_02]: Finally, I was just going to mention, kind of in the homebrew sense, Senile Team, the people behind this kind of a Streets of Rage franchise,

01:01:43.824 --> 01:01:57.014
[SPEAKER_02]: They have a new game coming out called Age of Beast, which looks like an updated version of Streets of Rage, but they've done it in more of the Altered Beast type thing.

01:01:57.555 --> 01:01:58.635
[SPEAKER_02]: It should be really cool.

01:01:58.715 --> 01:02:04.080
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm actually looking forward to playing around with it some more because you can do some shooter type stuff.

01:02:04.120 --> 01:02:04.700
[SPEAKER_02]: Pretty good game.

01:02:04.780 --> 01:02:08.563
[SPEAKER_02]: Definitely check them out at senileteam.segaforums.com

01:02:09.506 --> 01:02:09.826
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

01:02:10.786 --> 01:02:21.750
[SPEAKER_04]: And finally tonight, boys and girls, I hope this didn't happen to you, but World of Warcraft pulled what I would call a Ragnarok online this week when they said, we ban you.

01:02:22.570 --> 01:02:26.271
[SPEAKER_04]: We ban you to 18,000 accounts.

01:02:26.911 --> 01:02:27.652
[SPEAKER_04]: Canceled.

01:02:28.072 --> 01:02:29.092
[SPEAKER_04]: Why were they canceled?

01:02:30.080 --> 01:02:33.342
[SPEAKER_04]: Third-party programs to farm gold and items.

01:02:33.883 --> 01:02:35.564
[SPEAKER_04]: Stop effing up the economy.

01:02:35.964 --> 01:02:36.705
[SPEAKER_04]: You're banned.

01:02:37.926 --> 01:02:39.567
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually got my account canceled.

01:02:40.708 --> 01:02:42.269
[SPEAKER_04]: You weren't one of these 18,000, were you?

01:02:42.489 --> 01:02:44.551
[SPEAKER_00]: No, they rejected my ATM card because I got a new one.

01:02:45.812 --> 01:02:47.313
[SPEAKER_04]: That's not nearly as interesting.

01:02:48.291 --> 01:02:50.012
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't care if it's about you, that's not interesting.

01:02:52.213 --> 01:02:54.495
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course if it's about me it's interesting, I'm a show diva.

01:02:54.515 --> 01:02:58.677
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to go around now and get everybody's final thought because we're about to wrap it up.

01:02:58.717 --> 01:03:01.579
[SPEAKER_04]: We do have one more note for you guys, but first the final thoughts.

01:03:02.220 --> 01:03:03.080
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki, your final thought.

01:03:03.681 --> 01:03:09.644
[SPEAKER_02]: My final thought is I've got to get to playing some of these games that I have on cue to basically play.

01:03:10.505 --> 01:03:13.887
[SPEAKER_02]: Kingdom Hearts 2, of course, because I have a walkthrough because I can't read Japanese.

01:03:15.038 --> 01:03:29.544
[SPEAKER_04]: my final thought would be January 1st on our live show we're making a huge announcement about the future of Orange Lounge Radio it will change everything it's going to be good check it out of course if you missed that we will say it on the podcast as well

01:03:31.306 --> 01:03:34.948
[SPEAKER_02]: and we're getting drunk?

01:03:35.649 --> 01:03:38.831
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, yeah, that'll be interesting nonetheless.

01:03:39.511 --> 01:03:43.833
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course that will air at 2 a.m.

01:03:44.374 --> 01:03:44.994
[SPEAKER_00]: London time.

01:03:45.014 --> 01:03:46.775
[SPEAKER_04]: 6.30 to 9.30.

01:03:47.115 --> 01:03:49.016
[SPEAKER_04]: The next day.

01:03:49.777 --> 01:03:50.977
[SPEAKER_04]: Big, big announcement January 1st.

01:03:51.557 --> 01:03:52.898
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, your final thought.

01:03:53.839 --> 01:03:57.741
[SPEAKER_00]: Reject false icons and number two, remember, don't shoot the food.

01:03:59.087 --> 01:04:06.311
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, of course, we have one other little footnote because, you know, it is the holiday season and it's, you know, we're still spreading the cheer.

01:04:06.371 --> 01:04:10.234
[SPEAKER_04]: Even if Christmas is over, there's still, you know, Hanukkah, Kwanzaa, a bunch of holidays.

01:04:10.254 --> 01:04:12.135
[SPEAKER_00]: My brother told me happy Kwanzaa today.

01:04:12.155 --> 01:04:15.617
[SPEAKER_04]: Because you're so, you know, Kwanzaa celebrating.

01:04:15.657 --> 01:04:16.458
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway.

01:04:18.739 --> 01:04:18.939
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway.

01:04:20.953 --> 01:04:21.253
[SPEAKER_04]: DreamStation.cc

01:04:46.238 --> 01:04:49.701
[SPEAKER_04]: The folks from the Dream Station Video Game Show actually put this little happy holiday song together.

01:04:50.022 --> 01:04:55.807
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's kind of funny because they talk about noobs getting pwned in it, which is, you know, if you speak elite, that's pretty funny.

01:04:56.327 --> 01:04:58.029
[SPEAKER_04]: So we thought we'd play it for you guys here.

01:04:58.089 --> 01:05:03.694
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you want to hear more crazy antics from these guys, head on over to www.dreamstation.cc.

01:05:03.774 --> 01:05:06.717
[SPEAKER_04]: And remember, kids, support independent podcasts.

01:05:08.178 --> 01:05:09.179
[SPEAKER_04]: And we're closing with this.

01:05:09.259 --> 01:05:10.160
[SPEAKER_04]: So have a great week.

01:05:10.180 --> 01:05:10.961
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll see you next time.

01:05:15.526 --> 01:05:44.025
[SPEAKER_05]: The sounds of screams of love and stream, the camping center you haven't seen It's Christmas at Dream Station, where all the noobs get pwned The Halo fans with their demands, gripping on keyboard and mouse commands And FPS is still the best when playing it on PC A head shoppie comes open, it's time to make him fall And loyal Jack before he's back will sue us for house and door How brand new it feels to click your heels, writing this pro as you hear him squeal The council's full of party that likes you'll never know

01:05:44.485 --> 01:05:47.822
[SPEAKER_05]: It's Christmas Happy Station where all the news get pwned

01:05:55.396 --> 01:06:16.765
[SPEAKER_05]: The Net Cafe is where I play Addicted to gaming, I spend my pay It's Christmas in Korea, I haven't had food for days Xbox knows it's only slow Poor Nintendo has nothing to show The PC's slowly dying, except for the MMO The ducks are playing Madden, the chicks are playing WoW The PC dudes are fragging noobs, the noobs are wondering how

01:06:17.505 --> 01:06:19.126
[SPEAKER_05]: And just one final footnote.

01:06:19.166 --> 01:06:20.067
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't expect us to sing.

01:06:20.167 --> 01:06:20.247
[SPEAKER_05]: Ever.

01:06:20.287 --> 01:06:20.487
[SPEAKER_05]: Ever.

01:06:20.527 --> 01:06:22.649
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, I think that we should end this show on a high note.

01:06:22.669 --> 01:06:22.869
[SPEAKER_05]: What?

01:06:22.929 --> 01:06:24.590
[SPEAKER_05]: Except I can't sing that high note.

01:06:42.220 --> 01:06:45.042
[SPEAKER_02]: We already know how the whole singing thing went down.

01:06:46.443 --> 01:06:46.843
[SPEAKER_04]: I forgot.

01:06:46.883 --> 01:06:48.244
[SPEAKER_04]: Put a copy of Karaoke Revolution.

01:06:48.364 --> 01:06:49.885
[SPEAKER_00]: No, no, no.

01:06:50.305 --> 01:06:57.049
[SPEAKER_00]: I think when we do our little outtakes DVD, we need to put I'm Staying In on it.

01:06:59.250 --> 01:07:00.130
[SPEAKER_04]: Longest show ever.

01:07:00.230 --> 01:07:00.871
[SPEAKER_04]: Good job, guys.

01:07:00.911 --> 01:07:02.012
[SPEAKER_04]: Happy holidays.

01:07:02.052 --> 01:07:03.092
[SPEAKER_04]: This is our gift.

01:07:03.372 --> 01:07:04.453
[SPEAKER_04]: See you next time.

01:07:05.854 --> 01:07:09.397
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the end of another Orange Lounge Radio To Go edition.

01:07:09.717 --> 01:07:15.222
