00:30.000 --> 00:32.000
Oh

02:00.000 --> 02:08.000
What's up, what's up, what's up, what's up?

02:38.000 --> 02:59.680

02:59.680 --> 03:23.680

You are tuned in to Orange Lounge Radio and we are all set for episode number 166, tonight,

04:40.080 --> 04:43.400
December 4th, 2005.

04:43.400 --> 04:47.560
We're going to talk a little bit about what's going on at that game festival that none of

04:47.560 --> 04:51.120
us were cool enough to actually go to, but I hear there's a lot of cell phone action

04:51.120 --> 04:53.120
going on, so we're going to talk a little bit about that.

04:53.120 --> 04:56.880
Of course, how was your week, how was your day, cage match and all that fun stuff you

04:56.880 --> 05:03.880
chatters know and love, so come on board, we'll start right after this.

05:56.880 --> 06:03.880
Orange Lounge may contain adult content, Orange Lounge may contain many four-letter words,

06:16.880 --> 06:23.880
Orange Lounge may contain a scene of nudity, Orange Lounge may contain plenty of...

06:23.880 --> 06:30.320
Just kidding, Orange Lounge Radio will not contain any of that.

06:30.320 --> 06:31.320
In this episode...

06:31.320 --> 06:37.760
Why isn't that special?

06:37.760 --> 06:48.760

07:08.200 --> 07:12.640
You're tuned into Orange Lounge Radio, radio that gamers really want, and this is Orange

07:12.640 --> 07:17.640

We're plugged in and fully interactive

07:22.920 --> 07:27.360
through our website, www.orangeloungeradio.com.

07:27.360 --> 07:29.240
My name is Rob Roberts, you might know me as Sky.

07:29.240 --> 07:31.280
Joining me, as always, are my awesome co-hosts

07:31.280 --> 07:33.060
in that corner of the Happiest Bunny on the Farm,

07:33.060 --> 07:35.400
Ms. Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers.

07:35.400 --> 07:36.320
I like burritos.

07:37.960 --> 07:39.280
That's good.

07:39.280 --> 07:41.080
Was it a steak burrito, or was it a veggie burrito?

07:41.080 --> 07:43.320
It was a vegetarian burrito.

07:43.320 --> 07:44.480
Like beans.

07:44.480 --> 07:45.320
And guess what?

07:45.320 --> 07:46.160
Beans make me poo.

07:46.160 --> 07:48.160
I have a voice lalalalala

07:48.160 --> 07:50.160
Congratulations!

07:50.160 --> 07:52.160
No hacking tonight.

07:52.160 --> 07:54.160
Just because I have codeine in my body.

07:54.160 --> 07:56.160
Hooray! Drugs!

07:56.160 --> 07:58.160
Yay! I love my opiates!

07:58.160 --> 08:01.160
Also joining us, say hello to the other drug fiend, Loki!

08:01.160 --> 08:03.160
I hate burritos.

08:03.160 --> 08:06.160
You hate burritos? Do they make you poop too?

08:06.160 --> 08:08.160
No, I just hate all Mexican food.

08:08.160 --> 08:12.160
Except for chips and salsa, but that's kind of borderline.

08:12.160 --> 08:22.160
Have you ever had the chips and salsa at Chipotle? Because they have lime chips. Like their chips have just a hint of lime.

08:22.160 --> 08:30.160
No. I've been to Sharky's. They have really good chips and salsa. And then just homemade chips and salsa.

08:30.160 --> 08:35.160
They have good carnitas at Felipe's by the house.

08:35.160 --> 08:38.160
Is that a mom-paw type place, Felipe?

08:38.160 --> 08:40.160
Sorta, yeah. But carnitas are yummy.

08:40.160 --> 08:42.960
There's a place over here by Target that's owned by Grandma.

08:42.960 --> 08:44.920
We call her Grandma because this really old lady owns it.

08:44.920 --> 08:45.920
No, she's so sweet.

08:45.920 --> 08:46.920
She's always nice to us.

08:46.920 --> 08:51.400
She always gives us lots of chips and salsa for free when we go there to do like takeout.

08:51.400 --> 08:55.200
And I feel bad because ever since Chipotle opened up, fucking no one goes to Grandma's

08:55.200 --> 08:56.200
anymore.

08:56.200 --> 08:57.200
Sad.

08:57.200 --> 08:58.200
We should go eat there.

08:58.200 --> 08:59.200
I know we should.

08:59.200 --> 09:00.200
Because I love Grandma.

09:00.200 --> 09:01.200
She's so sweet.

09:01.200 --> 09:02.200
Let's go.

09:02.200 --> 09:03.200
Let's go have a staff meeting there.

09:03.200 --> 09:06.560
Wait, how do you say Grandma in Spanish?

09:06.560 --> 09:07.560
I don't remember.

09:07.560 --> 09:08.560
I don't know.

09:08.560 --> 09:09.560
I'm sure someone in chat will tell me.

09:09.560 --> 09:11.560
Abuelita, is that it?

09:39.560 --> 09:40.560
Yeah.

09:40.560 --> 09:41.560
Yes.

09:41.560 --> 09:46.880
So, everyone's going to scream happy birthday and...

09:46.880 --> 09:49.720
By the way guys, I'm using the microphone tonight that sucks.

09:49.720 --> 09:51.280
I just want everybody to know.

09:51.280 --> 09:54.240
So if I cut in and out, deal with it.

09:54.240 --> 09:55.240
Aww.

09:55.240 --> 09:56.240
When you cut out, we'll cheer.

09:56.240 --> 09:57.240
Shut up.

09:57.240 --> 09:58.240
Alright, we're going to take a break.

09:58.240 --> 10:00.960
Then we're going to come back and have ourselves a show.

10:00.960 --> 10:08.200
Because we want to talk about TDR stuff and there's new videos for 2DX to talk about.

10:08.200 --> 10:12.440
There's also new Guitar Freaks V2 and Drummania music.

10:12.440 --> 10:14.560
And then there's Dick and Fart Jokes.

10:14.560 --> 10:18.280
So we gotta get, as usual, because it wouldn't be a show if we couldn't have some Dick and

10:18.280 --> 10:19.280
Fart Jokes.

10:19.280 --> 10:20.280
And musical burping.

10:20.280 --> 10:23.520
Uh, we'll be back after this, in this break, some Bahmani potpourri.

10:23.520 --> 10:28.680
We're gonna start it off with something I do every time I eat a lot of beans.

10:28.680 --> 10:30.680
Drop the bomb here on Orange Lounge Radio.

10:30.680 --> 10:32.680
D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D

11:00.680 --> 11:02.440
The rhythm is the part that you choose, we gotta get with it

11:02.440 --> 11:03.920
We're made in the center, you all might try

11:03.920 --> 11:05.680
We can do it now, you better snag those colors

11:05.680 --> 11:07.180
Yes, already take that ball

11:07.180 --> 11:09.680
You can make me cold, just drop that ball

11:11.180 --> 11:12.680
Yeah, yeah, drop that ball

11:14.680 --> 11:15.680
Just drop that ball

11:17.680 --> 11:18.680
Let's just keep that ball

11:23.680 --> 11:24.680
Yo, you got this build on rhythm

11:24.680 --> 11:26.180
If you need the lights, do it some sense

11:26.180 --> 11:27.680
We'll ride the wave to some coffee

11:27.680 --> 11:29.680
The rhythm is the part that you choose, we gotta get with it

11:29.680 --> 11:32.880
And you're staring all right for me to do it now, you're such a tango scholar

11:32.880 --> 11:36.280
You had to erase your face at four, and it's up to you to pick back four

11:38.680 --> 11:39.880
You dropped that ball

11:41.680 --> 11:43.080
You dropped that ball

11:45.080 --> 11:46.280
You dropped that ball

11:46.280 --> 11:48.280
Hey, did you drop that bomb?

12:46.280 --> 12:50.280
And when I'm on my own

12:50.280 --> 12:54.280
You will shine like a star in the eye

12:54.280 --> 12:59.280
Play me by your brilliant light

12:59.280 --> 13:04.280
Shine your light

13:34.280 --> 13:39.780
You've never seen the light shine in your eyes

13:39.780 --> 13:43.280
I'm never on my own

13:43.280 --> 13:47.280
You're shining like a star in the sky

13:47.280 --> 13:53.280
Made me by your way, I lie

15:17.280 --> 15:24.280
1, 2, 3, 4!

15:47.280 --> 16:09.620
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.

16:09.620 --> 16:11.620
You

16:39.620 --> 16:44.620
Orange Lounge Radio. We put your thing down, flip it, and reverse it.

16:44.620 --> 16:52.620
We're back here on Orange Lounge Radio.

16:52.620 --> 16:56.620
Happy December to you all. This is our first show for December.

16:56.620 --> 16:58.620
It's Decemberween!

16:58.620 --> 17:02.620
Have you been naughty or nice this year?

17:02.620 --> 17:06.620
Will Santa be bringing you lots of joy and wonderful gifts this year?

17:06.620 --> 17:12.540
this year or will he be bringing you charcoal? Actually, I found charcoal, little plastic

17:12.540 --> 17:16.060
charcoals filled with candy at Target. Oh, that's cute. That's a cute idea. I'm going

17:16.060 --> 17:20.220
to put some in Dan's stocking. And I thought he brought just real coal, which coal is actually

17:20.220 --> 17:32.180
worth quite a bit from what I hear. My skill in mining has gone up by one point. Angel,

17:32.180 --> 17:36.100
what did you get for your birthday? I was having sex with your cake during the break.

17:36.100 --> 17:45.100
Or, okay, she has this cake thing and it has a big hole in it, so I didn't really, guys, I didn't really have sex with the cake, but I pretended like I was going to have sex with the cake.

17:45.100 --> 17:48.100
And that was my way of frosting it. No, I'm kidding.

17:48.100 --> 17:50.100
Naughty, naughty, naughty!

17:50.100 --> 17:58.100
I'm so gonna get coal in my stocking. You know what I'm gonna get in my stocking this year? A pig's head. That's what I'm gonna get in my stocking this year.

17:58.100 --> 18:01.100
We're gonna give you a do-it-yourself taxidermy kit.

18:01.100 --> 18:03.100
You should deep fry that thing.

18:03.100 --> 18:07.100
If I get a pig's head, I would so deep-fry it, it'd be badass.

18:07.100 --> 18:12.100
Anyway, I'm sorry, Angel, the birthday girl. How was your birthday? Did you get any presents?

18:12.100 --> 18:14.100
Uh, just this, uh...

18:14.100 --> 18:17.100
That's cute. That's cute, though. I like that.

18:17.100 --> 18:20.100
It's a fuse necklace from, well, you can buy it, but thank you.

18:20.100 --> 18:30.100
It's like this piece of glass that they've, like, kind of, uh, polished, and they've stuck an LED light in there, and, heh heh, LED.

18:30.100 --> 18:36.940

18:36.940 --> 18:42.540

18:42.540 --> 18:47.660

a chance to go out today I actually went to but the sad thing is I was at the

mall for like five minutes but most that time was spent trying to find a parking

19:27.080 --> 19:32.040

19:32.040 --> 19:34.960

19:55.880 --> 19:57.880
But I could do that in real life.

19:57.880 --> 20:00.880
Well, yeah, you don't live that far from me, do you?

20:00.880 --> 20:04.880

20:57.080 --> 20:59.080
fuck you

20:59.080 --> 21:01.080
how was your week, how was your day

21:01.080 --> 21:03.080
Dark Sakura

21:03.080 --> 21:05.080
I spent most of the week having the plague

21:05.080 --> 21:08.080
But I decided that it might be the T-Virus.

21:08.080 --> 21:11.080
Like, isn't that what AIDS is?

21:11.080 --> 21:14.080
No, those are T-Cells.

21:14.080 --> 21:18.080
I pity the fool who don't understand the difference.

21:18.080 --> 21:23.080
No, the T-Virus was the zombie virus in Resident Evil in the first game.

21:23.080 --> 21:29.080
So I figured that if you ever start seeing Itchy Tasty show up on my live journal,

21:29.080 --> 21:33.080
like the entry before that would be Ugly Face So Shot Him,

21:33.080 --> 21:38.360
then the next one itchy tasty then you'd know that I turned into a zombie and

21:38.360 --> 21:42.180
then of course I'd be in here eating everybody's brains are you sniffing my

21:42.180 --> 21:50.340
spicy brains no I wasn't sniffing your spicy brains so um but I did have fun

21:50.340 --> 21:55.100
yesterday because I felt kind of better and I had already made plans so I went

21:55.100 --> 22:03.020
over to our friend Tia's house to make dinner which I made chicken and green

22:03.020 --> 22:05.880
means which I will post pictures of in the chat room because she took pictures

22:05.880 --> 22:09.720
of the food I cooked I thought it was sweet and then me and her and her

22:09.720 --> 22:13.820
roommate went to the thrift store but on the way there we were sort of like in

22:13.820 --> 22:17.660
the ghetto part of town that we saw Popeyes fried chicken and ate fried

22:17.660 --> 22:24.640
chicken in my car while listening to The Cure fried chicken biscuits with the

22:24.640 --> 22:28.960
But I, I'm in love with a chicken wing.

22:28.960 --> 22:31.960
No, it's like listening to pictures of you

22:31.960 --> 22:36.680
with eating, chowing down on fried chicken.

22:36.680 --> 22:39.960
What's that commercial that uses pictures of you?

22:39.960 --> 22:45.240
Do I watch TV? I'm asking hypothetically. It's the Kodak, right?

22:45.240 --> 22:49.000
No, that's true colors. They show that before the movies, too. No, that was like in the 80s.

22:49.000 --> 22:50.600
That's the last time you probably watched TV.

22:50.600 --> 22:55.240
The Kodak thing. They show us the movies too, you know, and they have the

22:55.240 --> 22:57.760
pictures of you. I think it is. It might be a digital camera. I don't know.

22:57.760 --> 23:02.120
I don't ever see the camera like that. But I can just imagine like a parody commercial of that, but you and Tia

23:02.120 --> 23:03.840
like just chowing down like a

23:03.840 --> 23:08.600
rabid pairing of chicken flesh and everything. It'd be great. Dude, we were all three eating that chicken.

23:08.600 --> 23:15.000
It was pretty cool. And then we went to the thrift store, which is the picture I just posted in the chat room.

23:15.000 --> 23:16.080
We were all trying on hats.

23:16.080 --> 23:19.680
And Tia tried on this nasty wig, so she was all mama's family.

23:19.680 --> 23:24.380
And there's another picture of me and her with cowboy hats, which I will post in the chatroom in a moment.

23:24.380 --> 23:28.680
I think that's going to be your new picture on whatever Orange Lawns Radio album art we switch to.

23:28.680 --> 23:32.080
No, no, no, no. I have to have the one in the plaid beanie, which I have to go back and buy.

23:32.080 --> 23:35.280
The plaid beret thing.

23:35.280 --> 23:42.280
Because we're all going to have new pictures. And there's a... Did I even tell you guys about the new intro for the podcast that's coming?

23:42.280 --> 23:45.680
Thank you, Rob, for keeping us in the loop and making executive decisions.

23:45.680 --> 23:47.680
I totally forgot about it.

23:47.680 --> 23:50.680
You said that we could have potentially won, but...

23:50.680 --> 23:52.680
That person is doing it, for sure.

23:52.680 --> 23:56.680
But we have to screen it when it's done to make sure we like it, of course.

23:56.680 --> 23:57.680
Okay.

23:59.680 --> 24:00.680
So you knew!

24:02.680 --> 24:03.680
Liar!

24:04.680 --> 24:06.680
Oh my god, Jamie's trying to fuck with me! She uses off me!

24:06.680 --> 24:08.680
Off of her head! Off of her head! Kill her!

24:11.680 --> 24:12.680
But...

24:12.680 --> 24:21.360
Yes, I do have a butt. It's very nice. It's very big. Hey! It's times like these you guys

24:21.360 --> 24:26.200
are glad we don't have the, uh, OLR webcam. Cause I just showed my butt to Jamie. I didn't

24:26.200 --> 24:31.600
show the skin, but I showed... Oh baby, I'm so turned on by your big, gay butt. I'm wearing

24:31.600 --> 24:36.640
tight jeans today. Cause my butt did get bigger, therefore my jeans are tighter. Those are

24:36.640 --> 24:40.000
actually really nice jeans. I like your very emo-looking holes in your face. Do you like

24:40.000 --> 24:45.240
this like the pre razor-bladed emo emo jeans here? I had the coolest jeans though in the

24:45.240 --> 24:49.240
80s because you remember during the Samantha Fox days how it was really cool to have all

24:49.240 --> 24:55.160
ripped up jeans. Naughty girls need love too. Well I, my mom would not let me cut my jeans

24:55.160 --> 24:59.120
I was so pissed off so I went roller skating and I ran into the wall and back then at the

24:59.120 --> 25:05.220
roller rink the wall was made out of carpet and I carpet burned the knees out of my jeans

25:05.220 --> 25:08.660
running into the wall and sliding against it.

25:08.660 --> 25:12.320
And I had the biggest rug burn on my knee.

25:12.320 --> 25:13.660
It was crazy.

25:13.660 --> 25:17.900
Didn't Samantha Fox also do Let the Music Play? No. What am I getting?

25:17.900 --> 25:20.280
That was, her name was

25:20.280 --> 25:21.300
Shannon.

25:21.300 --> 25:22.740
Oh, that's right.

25:22.740 --> 25:26.680
Samantha Fox did, um,

25:26.680 --> 25:29.820
crap, now I forgot that other song she did.

25:29.820 --> 25:33.980
She did Naughty Girls Need Love Too and, um,

25:33.980 --> 25:37.980
I forget. Anyway, um, but back to, uh, my life.

25:37.980 --> 25:41.980
Yes, I remember being young in the 80s.

25:41.980 --> 25:45.980
Maybe. Just maybe.

25:45.980 --> 25:49.980
Naughty girls need love too.

25:53.980 --> 25:57.980
It's one of my favorite songs ever.

25:57.980 --> 26:01.980
I do not like big butts. I'm trying to get rid of mine.

26:01.980 --> 26:06.980
Oh my god, well I'll talk about it during my, I made a I like big butts reference this weekend, but anyway, I'm sorry.

26:06.980 --> 26:07.980
I'll get to it later.

26:07.980 --> 26:17.980
I also found out during the whole point in time that I've had my degenerative disease that I dropped something like 16 pounds during the month of November.

26:17.980 --> 26:18.980
Oops.

26:18.980 --> 26:20.980
Because I couldn't eat.

26:20.980 --> 26:24.980
Which is funny because I bet that makes you the biggest loser and you weren't even playing the game.

26:24.980 --> 26:27.980
No, I wasn't.

26:27.980 --> 26:32.860
I also found out that I really like eggnog flavored things like eggnog ice cream because I had some last night

26:32.860 --> 26:38.940
The uh, yeah, the eggnog stuff that they do it like Starbucks and stuff the eggnog lattes. They do this at my work. Oh

26:39.460 --> 26:42.380
Good shit, and and and and and

26:43.340 --> 26:49.420
Eggnog ice cream at Baskin-Robbins. This stuff is the best thing ever because I love ice cream

26:53.020 --> 26:55.020
Excuse me, that was my latte saying hi

26:55.020 --> 26:59.020
Anything else you want to show about your week and your day in the 80s?

26:59.020 --> 27:04.020
Um, I did really shitty homework all day. And then I'm going to, after the show, I'm going to go home and do more.

27:04.020 --> 27:06.020
I just thought I'd let you know.

27:06.020 --> 27:07.020
Okay. What kind of homework?

27:07.020 --> 27:10.020
I have Illustrator this morning, Dreamweaver when I get home.

27:10.020 --> 27:13.020
And I'm going to be doing my geography homework during lunch tomorrow.

27:13.020 --> 27:15.020
Geography.

27:15.020 --> 27:19.020
Ugh, I'm so glad that class is going to be over in two weeks!

27:19.020 --> 27:21.020
And I have jury duty on the 19th.

27:21.020 --> 27:24.440
really if you're taking geography maybe you can answer a question for me is

27:24.440 --> 27:32.040
Canada a state or not Canada is a country oh there's a lot of people just

27:32.040 --> 27:36.840
say it's another state has territories I know I'm just I'm just teasing these

27:36.840 --> 27:41.240
Canada is a state in the dipshit I just wanted to piss off soccer you know

27:41.240 --> 27:46.840
whatever Canadian listeners we have so no did you hear what I just said whoever

27:46.840 --> 27:51.780
Whoever says that Canada is a state, whoever legitimately thinks that.

27:51.780 --> 27:53.780
You know there's people out there that think that.

27:53.780 --> 27:55.880
Well they're dipshits.

27:55.880 --> 27:57.820
And Canada's just one big state.

27:57.820 --> 28:01.780
They need to be drug out into the street, and then someone needs to...

28:01.780 --> 28:06.000
The Queen of England is the Governor of Canada.

28:06.000 --> 28:09.520
It makes perfect sense that Canada is a state, I mean that's how Alaska's attached to the

28:09.520 --> 28:11.760
rest of the United States.

28:11.760 --> 28:14.360
They need to be taken out into the middle of the street and then someone needs to get

28:14.360 --> 28:18.040
like a big stinky sweat you know sweat sock and then put a tennis ball in it

28:18.040 --> 28:23.160
and beat him in the head with it a wet one like fresh from the football players

28:23.160 --> 28:29.960
foot I it's just another state where they have you know health care you know

28:29.960 --> 28:35.800
I'm teasing of course I'm not that stupid and dirty French people I do have

28:35.800 --> 28:41.180
to say having known quite a number of French Canadians during my time of

28:41.180 --> 28:48.060
living immobile and I try not to make generalizations about people I prefer

28:48.060 --> 28:54.140
the French to the French Canadians I think soccer inas from Quebec you're

28:54.140 --> 29:02.000
gonna have I think in general all right you make him cry don't make our listeners

29:02.000 --> 29:07.060
cry again don't make the listeners cry again okay that's like the third time

29:07.060 --> 29:14.980
this month and we're only on the fourth you know what what dude okay right Cola

29:14.980 --> 29:22.820
is yummy I know I see their time dude did Canada invent tab because if they

29:22.820 --> 29:30.700
did seriously nuke them I'm actually I was actually suggesting to my well I

29:30.700 --> 29:35.700
wanted to suggest to my husband that we moved to Canada it's cold you'd be cold

29:35.700 --> 29:38.700
I like cold. Your nips will be hard all day.

29:38.700 --> 29:40.700
Bitch!

29:40.700 --> 29:42.700
Don't say it! I like cold!

29:42.700 --> 29:48.700
I'm going to go ahead and say this now. There is the possibility of us moving in a year.

29:48.700 --> 29:50.700
Wow.

29:50.700 --> 29:54.700
That does not mean I will no longer be doing the show.

29:54.700 --> 29:58.700
You'll be freaking rich because the dollar is worth more over there.

29:58.700 --> 30:00.700
I'll just convert all my money.

30:00.700 --> 30:06.700
That's it. That's it. Next Christmas, I'm gonna convert all my money to Canadian dollars and then go shopping and then come back.

30:07.700 --> 30:10.700
We probably have other Canadian listeners who are listening and going,

30:10.700 --> 30:12.700
these people are jerks.

30:12.700 --> 30:17.700
It's all right. We had to make fun of this continent for once, you know, because it's always, you know.

30:17.700 --> 30:19.700
And like, you know what? You know what?

30:19.700 --> 30:23.700
I love Canada because I could get gay married there if I wanted to.

30:23.700 --> 30:29.700
But honestly, if I moved to any country, it's gonna be to the UK.

30:29.700 --> 30:35.700
Because seriously, I am so pissed off at our government.

30:35.700 --> 30:38.700
I hate the situation here.

30:38.700 --> 30:41.700
So hopefully, I'm going to say this publicly on the air.

30:41.700 --> 30:47.700
If any, I want to be hired by zombie flesh eaters, please. Thank you.

30:47.700 --> 30:50.700
Alright. Loki, how was your week? How was your day?

30:50.700 --> 30:56.700
My week was okay. I kicked the crap out of the rest of my colleagues in Granitahto per usual.

30:56.700 --> 31:02.140
And now we're actually going to start keeping stats now, just because I want to know how

31:02.140 --> 31:04.140
badly I'm winning.

31:04.140 --> 31:10.780
And other than that, I've been just waiting for my 360 to come in, talking to people at

31:10.780 --> 31:15.980
GameStop and they haven't even gotten another shipment in, so yay Microsoft!

31:15.980 --> 31:23.860
Meanwhile, Microsoft launched in Europe with less than expected 360s because, you know,

31:23.860 --> 31:27.140
those should have come over here instead of sending them to the UK.

31:27.140 --> 31:28.500
Yeah, we got ours.

31:28.500 --> 31:31.540
It freezes all the time.

31:31.540 --> 31:36.460
Anyways, then I was also waiting for my accessories to show up at my work, and those

31:36.460 --> 31:40.900
still haven't come in either, because Microsoft once again is slow on sending something out.

31:40.900 --> 31:46.540
I swear to God, they just, like, screw everything up. They really don't know what they're doing.

31:46.540 --> 31:49.780
Because, you know, it makes perfect sense. Let's go ahead...

31:49.780 --> 31:53.940
We're really short on units in the United States, let's go ahead and launch it in other

31:53.940 --> 31:57.460
countries so that they're also disappointed in our launch as well.

31:57.460 --> 32:01.540
That'd make perfect sense.

32:01.540 --> 32:04.880
And then what, next week they're going to do Japan and then Japanese just won't give

32:04.880 --> 32:08.300
a shit because none of them are buying it?

32:08.300 --> 32:11.940
Actually I hear more people give a shit about Xbox 360 than like the revolution, as I was

32:11.940 --> 32:12.940
reading some...

32:12.940 --> 32:16.660
Yeah, because there's no info about the revolution, the 360's coming out.

32:16.660 --> 32:19.500
So I don't know.

32:19.500 --> 32:31.500
That's why I, boys and girls, we did just have a big-ass net split in our chat room, so folks are dropping like flies, but, you know, life goes on, so just keep trying.

32:31.500 --> 32:41.500
Other than that, that's pretty much the main part of the week. I didn't really do anything of importance other than kick the crap out of my colleagues in Grand Theft Auto.

32:41.500 --> 32:42.500
Can you check that out?

32:42.500 --> 32:44.500
Because I rock.

32:44.500 --> 32:48.500
Yeah, that's about it.

32:48.500 --> 32:54.500
Alright, super. Angel! Angel, Angel, Angel, how was your week? How was your day?

32:54.500 --> 33:03.500
Good. School, grrr. Finals next week, good. Why? Because I get to go... wait, no more.

33:03.500 --> 33:14.500
Well, two weeks, and then school's over, and then I get to go back to my parents' house for like ten days and hang out in the bay.

33:14.500 --> 33:18.500
Uh, so that'll be fun. Um... other than that...

33:18.500 --> 33:23.000
Everybody's leaving for Christmas. I hate Christmas. You know why? Because everybody fucking leaves.

33:23.000 --> 33:27.000
You're going to the Bay Area, Shane's going back to Kansas. Who else is leaving?

33:27.000 --> 33:29.000
Who else is leaving for Christmas? Are you leaving for Christmas?

33:29.000 --> 33:29.500
No.

33:29.500 --> 33:31.000
Good. Are you leaving for Christmas?

33:31.000 --> 33:31.500
No.

33:31.500 --> 33:32.500
Good.

33:32.500 --> 33:34.000
Anyway, yeah, so, I get to do that.

33:34.000 --> 33:37.000
You know, I'm gonna go to Canada for Christmas, just to be trendy.

33:37.000 --> 33:42.000
Heh. Um... yeah. Oh yeah, World of Warcraft.

33:42.000 --> 33:45.000
And we're all on the same server now. That's pretty funny, isn't it?

33:45.000 --> 33:47.000
I refuse to play on that server.

33:47.000 --> 33:49.000
Why?

33:49.000 --> 33:52.000
Because I'm already playing on two other servers.

33:52.000 --> 33:54.000
But people are welcome to play with me.

33:54.000 --> 33:58.000
It doesn't matter. I barely play World of Warcraft anymore. It's kind of sad.

33:58.000 --> 34:00.000
I do, however, play Dragon Quest.

34:00.000 --> 34:03.000
I haven't played a lot of games at all this week, though. Really, it's kind of sad.

34:03.000 --> 34:06.000
Yeah, I've just kind of done World of Warcraft when I can.

34:06.000 --> 34:10.000
Most of the week's been dedicated to school, so...

34:10.000 --> 34:32.000
And then my birthday, so nothing really happened this week, per se, just World of Warcraft when I could, and then homework, and then sleep, and then school, and you know, the regular usual grind. So I've had a very boring week, aside from today, so it's all good.

34:32.000 --> 34:38.000
Alright, my week and my day.

34:38.000 --> 34:39.000
Pretty good.

34:39.000 --> 34:40.000
I had a pretty good week.

34:40.000 --> 34:43.960
You know, just really busy, work stuffs and all that good things and I really wasn't getting

34:43.960 --> 34:44.960
a lot of sleep this week.

34:44.960 --> 34:48.560
Oh yeah, this was my week where it was like energy drinks kept me through this week and

34:48.560 --> 34:51.260
I never drink those energy drinks because they're horrible for you.

34:51.260 --> 34:56.000
Like Ecstafur, who's not here tonight because he's on the road right now, Ecstafur was telling

34:56.000 --> 35:02.280
me about how those energy drinks sent his brother to the hospital, because his brother

35:02.280 --> 35:06.760
drank too many of those things, like the buku and the rockstar and all that shit. You gotta

35:06.760 --> 35:10.320
be careful with that stuff. Like, use them once in a while if you absolutely need to,

35:10.320 --> 35:14.120
but otherwise, that stuff will kill you. Why are your eyes lighting up like his new Christmas

35:14.120 --> 35:17.680
toy, Loki? Your eyes are lighting up like, oh my gosh, I'm so excited, I'm gonna go drink

35:17.680 --> 35:24.080
a bunch. Yeah! Cause you wanna go to the hospital? No, I don't like the hospital, but I think

35:24.080 --> 35:27.760
I can handle it. I'll drink that with alcohol. That'd be perfect.

35:27.760 --> 35:31.080
Well, that's okay. Like Red Bull and vodka, because you don't really drink that much of

35:31.080 --> 35:35.920
it. But like, okay, this is seriously bad, okay? Wednesday, I had a rock star. Thursday,

35:35.920 --> 35:41.080
I had a rock star. Friday, I had a rock star. Not good. I should not be drinking that much

35:41.080 --> 35:43.720
energy drinks. You're sounding like Pam Anderson.

36:13.720 --> 36:16.400
especially Red Bull, which looks and tastes like piss.

36:16.400 --> 36:20.280
Oh, actually Red Bull to me, now not that I really know what this tastes like, but actually

36:20.280 --> 36:22.760
a lesbian told me this, is that Red Bull tastes like pussy.

36:22.760 --> 36:27.440
But it looks like pee. Obviously I don't know this to be true because

36:27.440 --> 36:30.680
I've never really eaten pussy because, you know, I am a homosexual.

36:30.680 --> 36:37.480
However, well I did date girls in college and stuff, but you know, I never, you know,

36:37.480 --> 36:47.080
that thing uh-huh which involves yeah that part however I've been told by by

36:47.080 --> 36:53.660
a couple lesbians that it indeed tastes like pussy so I I therefore I shouldn't

36:53.660 --> 36:57.480
like Red Bull but I do drink it once a while it's really good with vodka and I

36:57.480 --> 36:59.480
I don't remember where I was going with this.

36:59.480 --> 37:01.480
It still looks like piss.

37:03.480 --> 37:05.480
Uh, yeah.

37:05.480 --> 37:07.480
Anyway.

37:07.480 --> 37:09.480
I don't remember where I was going with that. I know.

37:09.480 --> 37:11.480
Train derailed. Show derailed.

37:11.480 --> 37:13.480
Uh, let's see.

37:13.480 --> 37:15.480
Back on topic. Back on topic.

37:15.480 --> 37:17.480
Oh, uh, let's see.

37:17.480 --> 37:19.480
Um, I saw a friend of mine this weekend.

37:19.480 --> 37:21.480
A couple of friends of mine

37:21.480 --> 37:23.480
this weekend who I hadn't seen in a while.

37:23.480 --> 37:25.480
So that was cool.

37:25.480 --> 37:34.040
and I saw some karaoke revolution partay which was fun and um but karaoke revolution

37:34.040 --> 37:38.840
party is kind of overdone for me now I think I think I've seen too much of it like if I

37:38.840 --> 37:44.600
hear another fucking person saying I will always love you I'm going to force them to

37:44.600 --> 37:50.600
drink a gallon of red bull or something because I can't stand to hear people sing those songs

37:50.600 --> 38:02.040
anymore. However, all in all, good times. And I ate a lot of food this weekend. That's

38:02.040 --> 38:08.200
about it. I've been in a mood, I've actually, I have to say, I'm going to be absolutely,

38:08.200 --> 38:12.240
absolutely freaking lutely honest. I've had male PMS like all week long. Like I don't

38:12.240 --> 38:17.040
know what it is. I suspect, and I probably shouldn't be laughing about this or bringing

38:17.040 --> 38:20.480
this up on the show, but I suspect that I'm one of those people that probably gets really

38:20.480 --> 38:25.960
affected by the weather, the seasonal disorder, whatever, because seriously, I always get

38:25.960 --> 38:31.680
male PMS in December when the seasons start changing around here. Like always. And so

38:31.680 --> 38:36.400
this week I've been kind of PMS-y and I haven't wanted to do a whole lot except nap. So that's

38:36.400 --> 38:41.720
the reality. That's not me making shit up for radio. That's the reality is that I really

38:41.720 --> 38:50.440
haven't done a lot this week cuz cuz I've been sad oh I forgot I forgot to

38:50.440 --> 38:55.440
mention I bought another game for the Xbox 360 and make the total of five now

38:55.440 --> 39:01.800
five games for a system I don't own yes I just find that to be redo what are you

39:01.800 --> 39:06.080
getting your Xbox 360 have you figured it out yet um I'm thinking sometime

39:06.080 --> 39:14.920
before the apocalypse, um, perhaps... Well, they were telling me, they said, by Christmas,

39:14.920 --> 39:18.920
and they said I was halfway down the list. However, I actually got to see the list, and

39:18.920 --> 39:23.360
I'm not quite halfway down the list. I'm more of, oh, I don't know, five names from the

39:23.360 --> 39:28.160
bottom of the list. You know, it's like, oh, thank you very much. You know, so...

39:28.160 --> 39:31.840
Have there been more shipments of Xbox 360 since the first?

39:31.840 --> 39:36.420
not uh... game stop elise uh... we can

39:36.420 --> 39:40.060
well i mean like in general yeah but you have some of the works for games uh...

39:40.060 --> 39:43.340
but i'm talking about average joe's here

39:43.340 --> 39:47.200
i mean hell let's let's talk about my boss who you know

39:47.200 --> 39:51.820
one of our co-workers you know their boyfriend works for game stop and he

39:51.820 --> 39:55.980
ordered his after mind and he got a large state gee i wonder how that works

39:55.980 --> 39:58.420
we didn't do that

39:58.420 --> 40:00.820
well i know you didn't do that

40:00.820 --> 40:06.820
I'm not talking about you. I'm just saying that, you know, it's impossible to get one.

40:06.820 --> 40:11.640
But anyways, no, they haven't really gotten one, at least not at the GameStop that's by

40:11.640 --> 40:16.700
my house. And I asked them if they had any more shipments since, you know, launch, and

40:16.700 --> 40:21.820
they said they hadn't gotten anything. Maybe next week, maybe whatever. But I don't know

40:21.820 --> 40:26.080
what's taking so long. And they're only making it worse for themselves now that they're launched

40:26.080 --> 40:31.280
in two different countries. I mean, if they didn't have enough units before, they're really

40:31.280 --> 40:35.640
not going to have them now. Supposedly there's going to be more Best Buy on the 18th for

40:35.640 --> 40:40.000
their Sunday sale or something like that. They're going to be advertising them again,

40:40.000 --> 40:44.000
so I might camp out a couple hours before they open.

40:44.000 --> 40:45.000
Dork.

40:45.000 --> 40:49.680
Well, I'm just tired. The whole thing is, I'm just, I have these games and I've been

40:49.680 --> 40:55.520
waiting you know it'll be you know a couple weeks now for this thing and I'm

40:55.520 --> 40:59.360
just kind of tired of waiting. At $60 a game that's about $300 in games you have right now.

40:59.360 --> 41:07.080
It's all credit. All store credit. I paid not one cent for any of those games. Amazing.

41:07.080 --> 41:13.680
Yeah so I'm not worried about that but the thing is it's just I really kind of

41:13.680 --> 41:17.940
want the system now since I've paid for it and you know waiting at you know

41:17.940 --> 41:22.300
GameStop, it's going to take me forever, even if they do get another shipment in, I'm not

41:22.300 --> 41:26.440
going to be on that shipment, so I've got to wait. And I'll be waiting until next year.

41:26.440 --> 41:32.200
By that time, hell, my work will have them then. It's just retarded. So, I might as well

41:32.200 --> 41:38.940
just go ahead and pick one up at GameStop, or Best Buy or whatever, and then just cancel

41:38.940 --> 41:41.620
my pre-order there and get my money back.

41:41.620 --> 41:45.700
I think we should go and kick Microsoft in the balls for what they're doing with this.

41:45.700 --> 41:47.700
I mean, seriously, this is stupid.

41:47.700 --> 41:52.740
And then they keep advertising their system and stuff. They're not in fucking stores, you morons.

41:52.740 --> 41:54.480
I mean, I haven't seen

41:54.480 --> 41:58.660
any Xbox 360 in stores now. No, they're not.

41:58.660 --> 42:01.160
It's not around, and

42:01.160 --> 42:03.440
their whole marketing is retarded.

42:03.440 --> 42:05.300
They really need to just

42:05.300 --> 42:08.980
stop. They should have. This whole worldwide launch is the most retarded thing.

42:08.980 --> 42:10.540
Okay, first off,

42:10.540 --> 42:14.820
they can't really say, oh yeah, we did a worldwide launch. No, you didn't.

42:14.820 --> 42:20.380
fail at that so you can't even you know hold that above everyone else's heads

42:20.380 --> 42:24.780
they should just launched in one country at first a couple months later launch

42:24.780 --> 42:28.900
another country and later another country poor Australia I mean that's

42:28.900 --> 42:33.460
kind of giving you an idea when units are actually going to be in stores March

42:33.460 --> 42:38.340
I mean they better hope that Sony isn't like oh yeah we're gonna be able to

42:38.340 --> 42:47.580
launch in a couple months, you know, with our PS3. So, it's just, it's ridiculous. That's

42:47.580 --> 43:00.580
all I got. Earth to rub. Sorry. We're going to go break. When we come back from break,

43:00.580 --> 43:05.880
we're going to open up the Skypline and your comments because it's not broken this week

43:05.880 --> 43:10.760
and we'll have that. So we'll be back

43:10.760 --> 43:13.960
after this mix of

43:13.960 --> 43:18.360
music from various bimani games. Won't that be fun?

43:18.360 --> 43:21.560
We'll be back with more Orange Lounge Radio and other

43:21.560 --> 43:28.560
news and some movie time, hopefully.

43:51.560 --> 43:55.560
He knew he had to try to let love in

43:55.560 --> 43:57.560
My mother let her know

43:57.560 --> 43:59.560
She was in the mood for talking

43:59.560 --> 44:02.560
But when he began to play the game

44:02.560 --> 44:06.560
Before he knew it he had told her how much he'd been hurting

44:06.560 --> 44:09.560
How he was hoping she was not the same

44:09.560 --> 44:13.560
Could you see the kind of way the family can

44:13.560 --> 44:16.560
After all of this time, could this be true love?

44:16.560 --> 44:20.560
And he said, boy, you don't have to love no more

44:20.560 --> 44:24.560
I'll give the love you need, do you holler in the guarantee?

44:24.560 --> 44:27.560
I'd like to rest, for I'm a fine lady

44:27.560 --> 44:30.560
You've been hard, but peaceful, but I am the cure

44:30.560 --> 44:34.560
And when you wake up late, thinking it's a dream

44:34.560 --> 44:37.560
The best day boy you know, you can count on me

44:37.560 --> 44:38.560
Believe me

44:38.560 --> 44:41.560
This lady, you know what she found in me

44:41.560 --> 44:43.560
Is a lady, kind of lady

44:43.560 --> 44:45.560
That can give you what you need

44:45.560 --> 44:46.560
Baby, a kind of lady

44:46.560 --> 44:48.560
That will never leave you lonely

44:48.560 --> 44:50.160
The lonely end of the neighborhood

44:50.160 --> 44:51.160
This little lady

44:51.160 --> 44:52.660
Finally found me your kind

44:52.660 --> 44:53.660
Look at me

44:56.960 --> 44:58.960
Keep the camera, keep the camera

45:00.360 --> 45:02.360
Keep the camera, keep the camera

45:03.760 --> 45:05.760
Keep the camera, keep the camera

45:07.060 --> 45:10.060
Keep the camera

45:14.060 --> 45:15.560
Bouncing in the moonlight

45:15.560 --> 45:17.460
You're dancing in the shadow

45:17.460 --> 45:19.460
We sing of the dream of the dream

45:20.460 --> 45:23.460
Night is the moment of self-infusion

45:24.460 --> 45:26.460
Things ever are what they seem

45:27.460 --> 45:30.460
The moon and the stars are a double creation

45:31.460 --> 45:33.460
The only reality's you and me

45:34.460 --> 45:37.460
The stars of your lips would be such a sensation

45:38.460 --> 45:40.460
So sweet my angel

45:41.460 --> 45:44.460
Give it to me all through the night

45:44.460 --> 45:48.000
You can't be scared to say it. And you say it.

45:48.000 --> 45:51.480
You've got to say it till the morning.

45:51.480 --> 45:55.680
You can't be scared. Can you hear it?

45:55.680 --> 45:59.640
Shake my tongue.

45:59.640 --> 46:03.240
Shake my tongue.

46:03.240 --> 46:06.500
Shake my tongue.

46:06.500 --> 46:10.020
Shake my tongue.

46:10.020 --> 46:12.160
Shake my tongue.

46:12.160 --> 46:14.160
You've got to be a girl

48:12.160 --> 48:14.160
Okay, let's go!

48:14.160 --> 48:16.160
Good job!

48:44.160 --> 48:45.160
Let's do it!

48:47.660 --> 48:49.160
Let's do it!

49:19.160 --> 49:26.160
Hi Ho, Kermit the Frog here, informing you that today's broadcast is going to be about

49:49.160 --> 49:54.320
of Orange Lounge Radio is brought to you by the letter B, the letter A, and the number

49:54.320 --> 49:55.320
59.

49:55.320 --> 49:59.960
Can you tell me how to get, how to get to Sesame Street?

49:59.960 --> 50:05.080
We're back here on Orange Lounge Radio and before the break we were talking a little

50:05.080 --> 50:08.920
bit about our weeks and our days and now of course we need to get into talking a little

50:08.920 --> 50:14.000
bit about what's going on with those music games we know and love and adore.

50:14.000 --> 50:19.380
And I'm hearing that there's some pretty big news going on with Beatmania US, the buddy

50:19.380 --> 50:22.600
of mine in chat telling me about this, I'm going to see if I can get him to call in in

50:22.600 --> 50:25.120
a little bit.

50:25.120 --> 50:26.640
But I guess some big stuff going on.

50:26.640 --> 50:28.720
I heard that the game festival was this weekend, right?

50:28.720 --> 50:31.920
That was the big festival that went on in San Francisco where they had a bunch of games

50:31.920 --> 50:32.920
that were being shown.

50:32.920 --> 50:38.520
It was like, it was kind of like E3 but the X Games or something.

50:38.520 --> 50:42.440
So I don't know how to explain it, what they were doing.

50:42.440 --> 50:46.920
But apparently Beatmania didn't show up the first day because of a really stupid mistake,

50:46.920 --> 50:51.400
not on Konami's end but on some festival planning end, so they didn't have Beatmania USA the

50:51.400 --> 50:52.400
first day.

50:52.400 --> 50:55.720
But I think it did finally make an appearance this weekend, so we probably know a little

50:55.720 --> 51:00.520
bit more about it, so I'm going to see if we can get somebody who might have been there

51:00.520 --> 51:03.080
to tell us a little more about it first hand.

51:03.080 --> 51:08.200
However, we do have news about what's going on with Beatmania over in Japan.

51:08.200 --> 51:16.140
at 2DX 13th style, also known as beginning 2DX distorted, because I think they are going

51:16.140 --> 51:22.120
back to saying 2DX 13, but they're still not saying, you know, 13th style or anything,

51:22.120 --> 51:26.160
so whatever you want to call it, distorted I guess would be the official name. They're

51:26.160 --> 51:31.560
actually location testing right now, and some folks snuck in a camera, and you know, this

51:31.560 --> 51:36.020
is like a high security place, and you know, these kids could probably get arrested for

51:36.020 --> 51:39.540
what they're doing but to bring joy to us all they snuck a camera in there and

51:39.540 --> 51:42.980
recorded some of what was going on on the location test and some of the songs

51:42.980 --> 51:46.780
and I hear now I haven't seen this but I hear that there's a pretty awesome video

51:46.780 --> 51:52.860
for a new song called star or some sorry not star field a sun field which you

51:52.860 --> 51:56.580
know obviously the name sounds an awful lot like star field but there's a pretty

51:56.580 --> 52:01.380
awesome video and one of our chatters Siggy suggested that we watch it so I

52:01.380 --> 52:05.780
said sure why not let's watch it so here it is we're gonna do a little bit of

52:05.780 --> 52:09.980
Orange Lawn's Movie Time. This is the location test for Sunfield. And you guys might be able

52:09.980 --> 52:16.980
to hear a little bit of the song in the background here.

52:39.980 --> 52:49.980
This definitely sounds nothing like Starfield.

52:49.980 --> 52:52.980
It's a BABYTRAN!

52:52.980 --> 53:01.980
This little baby verse of Tran sitting there with all these colored spheres flying around.

53:01.980 --> 53:03.980
Oh, and look at that little beach ball!

53:04.980 --> 53:06.980
And now baby Tran has passed out.

53:07.980 --> 53:08.980
It's falling.

53:09.980 --> 53:13.980
The camera was about to go up her ass, so that was not necessary.

53:13.980 --> 53:15.980
And so Tran had a beach ball.

53:15.980 --> 53:18.980
Oh, there's little Tran right on the beach ball. That's cute. I like that.

53:19.980 --> 53:21.980
Thought I looked like it. That was pretty excellent.

53:21.980 --> 53:23.980
Oh, hey! Tran's all grown up now.

53:24.980 --> 53:27.980
There's Tran. He's got a ball.

53:27.980 --> 53:33.980
And now Tran is flying on a colored something.

53:33.980 --> 53:35.980
There's a Walker! There's a Walker!

53:35.980 --> 53:37.980
Oh, gee.

53:37.980 --> 53:39.980
Is that a baby?

53:39.980 --> 53:41.980
Oh, is that a mommy Tran? A baby Tran?

53:41.980 --> 53:43.980
Oh, I get it.

53:43.980 --> 53:45.980
Here, play with your head.

53:47.980 --> 53:49.980
Time to change the diaper, baby Tran.

53:49.980 --> 53:51.980
Yay!

53:53.980 --> 53:55.980
Now back to the words I can't read.

53:55.980 --> 53:58.980
Driving into a smile.

53:58.980 --> 54:00.980
EGRID!

54:05.980 --> 54:07.980
I thought there was a lyric in the song.

54:07.980 --> 54:08.980
Happening this time.

54:08.980 --> 54:10.980
Something driving into a smile.

54:10.980 --> 54:12.980
That's a terrible thing to say.

54:18.980 --> 54:20.980
We're learning a cute video.

54:20.980 --> 54:27.980
Oh, look at that. You can almost see the reflection of the guy. We're gonna go have him arrested.

54:27.980 --> 54:34.980
That was cute. I like that. The video to iFutureList, which is over on that computer somewhere,

54:34.980 --> 54:38.080
the other extraterrestrial computer, it's pretty cool because you can actually see a

54:38.080 --> 54:42.180
Kiryamoka like really well in the video, and I just remember like, let me describe the

54:42.180 --> 54:50.280
video like this. One word. Shades. I swear to God, that was like a part of the video

54:50.280 --> 54:56.440
that stuck out in my mind. It was great. Anyway, check that out boys and girls.

54:56.440 --> 55:04.600
Those location test videos are posted over on BomaniStyle. So you can go

55:04.600 --> 55:08.000
check that out if you want. We post them on our website, but that's not really our

55:08.000 --> 55:12.040
thing. We don't want to tread on somebody else's territory, and the

55:12.040 --> 55:19.040
The pirating of 2DX videos has always been Bomani-style's forte, so have at it.

55:19.040 --> 55:22.880
Alright, we're going to open up the Skype line, boys and girls.

55:22.880 --> 55:27.440
I'm sure you kids want to call us and let us know what's going on.

55:27.440 --> 55:28.440
So the Skype line's open.

55:28.440 --> 55:29.440
Give us a call.

55:29.440 --> 55:30.440
Hello, you're on Orange Lawn's radio.

55:30.440 --> 55:31.440
Hello?

55:31.440 --> 55:32.440
Hello?

55:32.440 --> 55:33.440
You're on Orange Lawn's radio.

55:33.440 --> 55:34.440
Well, hello there.

55:34.440 --> 55:35.440
Okay, I think I can get to you.

55:35.440 --> 55:37.440
Hello? Y'all don't know what it sounds like on the radio.

55:37.440 --> 55:39.440
Well hello there.

55:39.440 --> 55:42.440
Okay, I think I can catch you now.

55:42.440 --> 55:43.440
Can you hear us?

55:43.440 --> 55:45.440
Yes, I can hear you.

55:45.440 --> 55:47.440
And who might this be?

55:47.440 --> 55:50.440
Oh, you're speaking to the one and only Mel-to-the-bizzle.

55:50.440 --> 55:55.440
Hello Mel-to-the-bizzle. How are you Mel-bizzle, Mr. Bizzle?

55:55.440 --> 56:00.440
Yes, yes, okay, you're just a little, you're a little bit intermittent in and out there, but.

56:00.440 --> 56:04.440
That's because Loki is downloading porn on the other computer.

56:04.440 --> 56:09.580
I am not doing any of that. He's downloading lots and lots of pornography and it's messing

56:09.580 --> 56:14.460
up our bandwidth. Yeah, I'm not surprised that Splooge is getting

56:14.460 --> 56:20.360
through the tubes of connection right now. Well, what's going on? How was the game festival?

56:20.360 --> 56:23.640
You went to the game festival, right? How was it?

56:23.640 --> 56:28.020
Well, it was pretty cool, you know, game and music experience, but I think, and I know

56:28.020 --> 56:32.560
you can definitely feel where I'm coming from when I say this, if you've been to E3, it's

56:32.560 --> 56:36.060
It's kind of like going to Vegas, you know, like, of video gaming.

56:36.060 --> 56:39.820
Everything's out there, it's so grandiose, you know, it's the whole nine.

56:39.820 --> 56:43.460
When you go to a game, it's kind of like taking a site trip to Reno.

56:43.460 --> 56:50.380
It's like going to Reno, yeah, I definitely hear that.

56:50.380 --> 56:54.100
Did you see any cool new things there at the Game and Music Experience, or whatever the

56:54.100 --> 56:55.100
hell it was called?

56:55.100 --> 56:58.340
There's a couple, yeah, the Game and Music Experience, there were a couple new things.

56:58.340 --> 57:02.860
I mean, I know most of the Orange Realms radio people want to hear about 2DX, and I think

57:02.860 --> 57:05.540
you kind of got the scoop that 2DX wasn't there until like today.

57:05.540 --> 57:06.860
Yeah, I heard about that.

57:06.860 --> 57:11.340
Yeah, well, I have to blow the scoop without knowing if you heard the full story, but essentially,

57:11.340 --> 57:15.260
first off, Friday, they didn't even put the freaking ROM in the display case.

57:15.260 --> 57:17.500
Granted, for a matter, this is games doing this.

57:17.500 --> 57:19.980
Konami and like all the other companies, they're not running their own boots.

57:19.980 --> 57:23.620
This is like all done by union members, and you know, like they really know about video

57:23.620 --> 57:24.620
games.

57:24.620 --> 57:28.100
So putting a lot of trust in people, and then them fucking it up, basically.

57:28.100 --> 57:32.940
Yeah, so, okay, so anyway, Jason, you know, he wasn't even going to be there this weekend,

57:32.940 --> 57:33.940
Jason, you know?

57:33.940 --> 57:36.580
But he comes down and he's like, you know, what the F is going on?

57:36.580 --> 57:41.420
And so we talked to the, you know, coordinator, and then they say, yeah, we can't find a ROM.

57:41.420 --> 57:43.020
Well, it's like, okay, great.

57:43.020 --> 57:46.580
Not only is our game not being displayed, but now, you know, there's a loose ROM and

57:46.580 --> 57:47.580
this could be some serious trouble.

57:47.580 --> 57:53.580
So Jason has to run back down to Konami, get the ROM, and get, like, a debug PS2, and,

57:53.580 --> 57:58.020
you know, bring that back up, like, Friday, like, at midnight or so, so, like, Saturday,

57:58.020 --> 58:00.020
We figured we were going to have everything up and running.

58:00.020 --> 58:04.520
Well, the geniuses that ran the whole place, you know, put in the ROM this time,

58:04.520 --> 58:08.520
but they used their own PS2, and not the one that Jason brought.

58:08.520 --> 58:11.520
So what happened was, you could play the game all the way up to select a song.

58:11.520 --> 58:13.520
When you select a song, the thing flows.

58:13.520 --> 58:17.020
And when the thing flows, people thought, oh great, this is, you know, a bugged ROM.

58:17.020 --> 58:19.020
This is going to be the best game ever.

58:19.020 --> 58:23.020
This is going to be the best game ever is what they were thinking.

58:23.020 --> 58:25.520
Yeah, so anyway, yeah.

58:25.520 --> 58:28.520
So that's a bug. And then Jason comes up and says, what the hell is going on?

58:28.520 --> 58:31.520
Finds out that they didn't use the PST that he gave them.

58:31.520 --> 58:36.520
And so he didn't get it up and running until like about 10 o'clock last night, which is essentially the time game closed.

58:36.520 --> 58:41.520
So it was finally up and running this morning, and I finally got to get a sneak peek in.

58:41.520 --> 58:46.520
I got a few like of the inside things that most people don't know about just by looking at BeatMania.

58:46.520 --> 58:48.520
Tell us, tell us, tell us.

58:48.520 --> 58:50.520
Tell us what?

58:50.520 --> 58:51.520
Tell us, tell us.

58:51.520 --> 58:53.520
Don't hold back anymore. Tell us what's going on.

58:53.520 --> 58:59.600
OK, so, alright, so, um, 2DX, you know, I got to check that out, um, the build looked

58:59.600 --> 59:02.960
a lot like, um, you know, 9th style, pretty much like what you see, it looked a little

59:02.960 --> 59:03.960
cleaner this time.

59:03.960 --> 59:09.120
As far as song lists, they didn't reveal a whole heck of a lot, because, you know, of

59:09.120 --> 59:12.920
course they still want to keep a lot of their stuff under wraps, there's a lot of new songs

59:12.920 --> 59:17.400
that he said, but, um, it's kind of cool the way they set it up, because, like, you know

59:17.400 --> 59:21.760
how BeatMe is supposed to have 5-key and 7-key, um, functionality?

59:21.760 --> 59:25.760
The way you like it is select screen, you can either choose BeatMania or BeatMania 2DX.

59:25.760 --> 59:29.120
So that's kind of like a neat little spin on that.

59:29.120 --> 59:32.240
And one little spin that, I don't know if anyone's mentioned this or not, but one thing

59:32.240 --> 59:37.920
that America does have, actually let's keep, well actually before we get to that, another

59:37.920 --> 59:42.760
thing they keep is they actually use Happy Sky naming conventions now, so now things

59:42.760 --> 59:49.160
are like beginner or easy or hyper and then, you know, hard, so I thought that was a neat

59:49.160 --> 59:50.160
split.

59:50.160 --> 59:56.480
The main thing that I heard that was confirmed was you notice how like when you watch hot

59:56.480 --> 59:59.920
bitches videos or like you know you play a song and you AAA it and you think oh man how

59:59.920 --> 01:00:03.040
can I prove to people I did this besides the score?

01:00:03.040 --> 01:00:07.560
TDX USA will be offering a you can save your replays.

01:00:07.560 --> 01:00:11.400
Wow, so you can save replays of songs.

01:00:11.400 --> 01:00:13.400
Are you going to be able to do anything with the internet?

01:00:13.400 --> 01:00:14.400
Yes.

01:00:14.400 --> 01:00:15.400
Yes?

01:00:15.400 --> 01:00:16.400
What's that?

01:00:16.400 --> 01:00:19.400
Are you going to be able to do anything with the internet?

01:00:20.400 --> 01:00:22.400
That wasn't mentioned.

01:00:22.400 --> 01:00:24.400
Oh, okay.

01:00:25.400 --> 01:00:33.400
I don't know about internet online play, but I do know that instant replays of your in-game are available.

01:00:34.400 --> 01:00:36.400
Very interesting.

01:00:37.400 --> 01:00:39.400
Yeah, you know, there were a couple of them.

01:00:39.400 --> 01:00:43.400
We were talking about the Konami style, like the new US controller.

01:00:43.400 --> 01:00:48.120
Because, the thing was, they didn't have it on display at games that weekend, because

01:00:48.120 --> 01:00:53.720
essentially, A, it felt like a little bit, you know, getting tested out and stuff, and

01:00:53.720 --> 01:00:59.120
B, they didn't want to get it jacked or broken, and you know how, like, when you go to a place

01:00:59.120 --> 01:01:03.720
that's open to the public, you know, TVX will get, I mean, come on, Roseville Golf Land,

01:01:03.720 --> 01:01:04.720
that's sad.

01:01:04.720 --> 01:01:05.720
Yeah.

01:01:05.720 --> 01:01:06.720
Gotcha.

01:01:06.720 --> 01:01:07.720
Okay.

01:01:07.720 --> 01:01:08.720
All right, so let's see.

01:01:08.720 --> 01:01:11.760
Yeah, so, I mean, we've got to talk to you about it, and it's like, apparently, you know,

01:01:11.760 --> 01:01:13.960
according to like some of the people who have played it,

01:01:13.960 --> 01:01:15.240
you know, from what he said,

01:01:15.240 --> 01:01:17.600
the controller feels a little bit, you know,

01:01:17.600 --> 01:01:20.160
it looks a lot sleeker, it's lighter.

01:01:20.160 --> 01:01:22.320
The keys aren't exactly like the Konami style

01:01:22.320 --> 01:01:24.080
where they're absolute like clicky-clicky,

01:01:24.080 --> 01:01:26.480
but from what I heard, they feel a lot better

01:01:26.480 --> 01:01:27.960
and they don't like stick.

01:01:29.080 --> 01:01:32.440
So they don't so much click, but they don't stick

01:01:32.440 --> 01:01:35.000
like the old controller does so much?

01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:36.320
They have a little bit more click

01:01:36.320 --> 01:01:38.520
than the like normal home-style controllers,

01:01:38.520 --> 01:01:40.680
but not as much like total, you know, perfect click,

01:01:40.680 --> 01:01:43.680
actually an arcade style.

01:01:43.680 --> 01:01:48.320
Okay, okay. Now, Loki brought up a picture in here in the studio

01:01:48.320 --> 01:01:52.760
of some, I think this is an ad, an ad for Beatmania, and you can clearly see this

01:01:52.760 --> 01:01:53.880
controller

01:01:53.880 --> 01:01:57.280
is rounded on the side. That's the cover shot.

01:01:57.280 --> 01:01:59.520
That's the cover shot of the game.

01:01:59.520 --> 01:02:01.120
And are you going to be able to flip,

01:02:01.120 --> 01:02:04.360
well, I guess you could still do the flip around the controller thing for

01:02:04.360 --> 01:02:06.020
either side.

01:02:06.020 --> 01:02:07.480
As far as I know, yeah, you can flip it.

01:02:07.480 --> 01:02:10.960
but it's weird because it's it's rounded on one side now it's not a completely

01:02:10.960 --> 01:02:14.240
rectangular controller it looks like uh...

01:02:14.240 --> 01:02:15.440
finger

01:02:15.440 --> 01:02:20.920
it's kinda rounded on one side so that's interesting

01:02:20.920 --> 01:02:21.760
alright

01:02:21.760 --> 01:02:26.340
anything else you want to share about what was going on with BeatMania?

01:02:26.340 --> 01:02:30.360
uh... let me think uh... as far as like five key songs and seven key songs

01:02:30.360 --> 01:02:34.440
i don't know i can't remember what the E3 list was like but as far as like five key songs

01:02:34.440 --> 01:02:41.440
I remember seeing, like, Hunting For You, Bossa Nova de Fabian, they had Battle Breaks,

01:02:41.440 --> 01:02:43.440
which I didn't see at E3.

01:02:43.440 --> 01:02:44.440
Okay, cool.

01:02:44.440 --> 01:02:50.000
Yeah, Battle Breaks, what else was there, Metal Gear, Salting, Paranoia Max, so yeah,

01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:54.160
that was kind of the default list, almost, for E3, except maybe like one or two songs.

01:02:54.160 --> 01:02:58.920
R7 Key, the hardest song I saw was Shining Polaris, so I thought I had E3 also, but they

01:02:58.920 --> 01:03:00.680
also have like the M Steps.

01:03:00.680 --> 01:03:05.160
It's that song from, it's style like, is it your fifth or no sixth style, it's the Shochiro

01:03:05.160 --> 01:03:11.080
Hirata song, that's like the two step song, oh the M Step 2 one, yeah I know what you're

01:03:11.080 --> 01:03:12.080
talking about, okay.

01:03:12.080 --> 01:03:17.560
Yeah they had that song, they had um, they had GMD on there which is surprising, the

01:03:17.560 --> 01:03:25.880
GMD okay, oh wow okay, yeah complicated like trigonometry, that was like third style wasn't

01:03:25.880 --> 01:03:30.560
it, that's an old song, I know yeah and the cool thing was they kept a lot of the 2DX

01:03:30.560 --> 01:03:35.760
those crossed over to this version, so like, you know, GMB with the pop locker and the

01:03:35.760 --> 01:03:38.080
breaker, yeah, you get to see that on there.

01:03:38.080 --> 01:03:40.240
Now were the Anothers there or not?

01:03:40.240 --> 01:03:42.440
That's what they're asking in chat.

01:03:42.440 --> 01:03:48.360
Um, Anothers, I can't remember, I tried to play like sharing Polaris with Another, but

01:03:48.360 --> 01:03:51.960
I can't remember if it was or not, you know, because I haven't played that song in a long

01:03:51.960 --> 01:03:52.960
time.

01:03:52.960 --> 01:03:57.920
But as far as I know, well, from what Jason had told me, as far as Anothers, I heard it's

01:03:57.920 --> 01:04:03.920
It might be something you have to unlock.

01:04:03.920 --> 01:04:06.920
It might be an unlock feature then, okay.

01:04:06.920 --> 01:04:07.920
Yeah.

01:04:07.920 --> 01:04:13.920
Did you see any of the DJ art, the goalie art, the art that shows up when you beat songs?

01:04:13.920 --> 01:04:14.920
What was it?

01:04:14.920 --> 01:04:19.920
Did you see any of the art, the artwork, the DJs on the completion screen?

01:04:19.920 --> 01:04:23.920
They didn't have any artwork, like when you get the certain gallery unlocks.

01:04:23.920 --> 01:04:26.920
No, I did not see that at the time, they just only had the stat screen.

01:04:26.920 --> 01:04:30.920
But that may still be a work in progress.

01:04:30.920 --> 01:04:33.920
Yeah, it's still a work in progress, you never know.

01:04:33.920 --> 01:04:37.920
I mean, I hear, like, well, the one thing that somewhat disappointed me was, um, 5-speed

01:04:37.920 --> 01:04:42.920
beat mania doesn't have their old, like, you know, 16-bit or whatever, like the, you know,

01:04:42.920 --> 01:04:44.920
those little block type videos.

01:04:44.920 --> 01:04:46.920
Yeah, the old style videos.

01:04:46.920 --> 01:04:52.920
But they, you know, kind of managed to make it a little more sleeker and, like, more or

01:04:52.920 --> 01:04:54.920
less, you know, recreate some of that stuff.

01:04:54.920 --> 01:05:01.160
I hear some songs get absolute total new video makeovers, but there really isn't any on which

01:05:01.160 --> 01:05:07.200
ones or just yet.

01:05:07.200 --> 01:05:09.800
That pretty much sums up 2DX.

01:05:09.800 --> 01:05:13.760
What I'll probably do is I'll post on Orange Mountains a full song list that I did see

01:05:13.760 --> 01:05:20.280
there because I have it on my video camcorder.

01:05:20.280 --> 01:05:25.960
I think that pretty much sums up 2DX at the game for today, you know, like I said, a lot

01:05:25.960 --> 01:05:29.760
of stuff I was able to try out with Jason just, you know, kind of, you know, because

01:05:29.760 --> 01:05:33.200
he wasn't really there to, like, answer questions or anything.

01:05:33.200 --> 01:05:34.200
Right.

01:05:34.200 --> 01:05:35.200
Okay.

01:05:35.200 --> 01:05:38.540
Well, I mean, that's pretty cool, though.

01:05:38.540 --> 01:05:42.760
I guess maybe it might have been out there about the recording thing.

01:05:42.760 --> 01:05:43.760
It was hidden.

01:05:43.760 --> 01:05:46.920
Somebody in their chat room was saying it was kind of hidden on the Music of a New Year

01:05:46.920 --> 01:05:48.920
It's actually hidden and it's listed right on there.

01:05:48.920 --> 01:05:50.920
Is it? But I didn't know about that before.

01:05:50.920 --> 01:05:53.920
Yeah, it says right on there, it's under game overview, it says...

01:05:53.920 --> 01:05:54.920
What happened?

01:05:54.920 --> 01:05:57.920
I guess that recording thing has been known. I didn't know that, though.

01:05:57.920 --> 01:06:00.920
Yeah, so save your performances and play them back for your friends.

01:06:00.920 --> 01:06:04.920
Somebody in chat said something about it, that it's actually on the Music in Every Direction site,

01:06:04.920 --> 01:06:08.920
but okay, interesting, I totally missed that when I looked at the site there.

01:06:08.920 --> 01:06:13.920
But that's cool about the song list, I did not know about M2-Step version 1.1.

01:06:13.920 --> 01:06:15.920
It does say there's also internet rankings.

01:06:15.920 --> 01:06:21.320
really interesting well we'll see well thank you for the inside scoop mail and

01:06:21.320 --> 01:06:24.800
and we'll be looking forward to seeing the song list and videos and other

01:06:24.800 --> 01:06:28.320
reactions over on orange large radio.com yeah sure it might even do I might

01:06:28.320 --> 01:06:32.000
probably do a more extensive game right up on orange lounge as well awesome did

01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:35.400
you see a lot of other cool things there did you see any of the live shows like

01:06:35.400 --> 01:06:40.800
freeze pop or zonk um see live shows you mean like the as far as the bands or

01:06:40.800 --> 01:06:41.800
or any demos.

01:06:41.800 --> 01:06:42.800
The bands?

01:06:42.800 --> 01:06:43.800
The bands?

01:06:43.800 --> 01:06:44.800
Yeah, how were the bands?

01:06:44.800 --> 01:06:46.800
Oh, bands, yeah, yeah, I actually got to see Zonta Friday night.

01:06:46.800 --> 01:06:47.800
Awesome, how was it?

01:06:47.800 --> 01:06:55.800
And, you know, it was pretty cool, I mean, it's like the first time I've seen the bands

01:06:55.800 --> 01:06:58.960
since the lead singer actually had her kid a couple months ago.

01:06:58.960 --> 01:06:59.960
Oh, wow.

01:06:59.960 --> 01:07:03.600
Yeah, and they, I mean, they always put on a great show live, they're one of those acts

01:07:03.600 --> 01:07:07.520
that, I mean, they may, I mean, they sound pretty decent, like when you listen to it

01:07:07.520 --> 01:07:10.460
like on you know your headphones or both to see them live they actually have

01:07:10.460 --> 01:07:16.280
they're great they have great showmanship great great I'm hoping that

01:07:16.280 --> 01:07:20.860
maybe we can talk to him at some point because I want to ask him about love

01:07:20.860 --> 01:07:24.380
this feeling and tittle-tattle and all that stuff so we'll see in the future

01:07:24.380 --> 01:07:29.100
some point hopefully okay yeah I'll work on scoring I'll work on scoring an

01:07:29.100 --> 01:07:32.820
interview because you know me and Dave you know we got it like that sounds good

01:07:32.820 --> 01:07:36.340
well Mel thank you for calling in and giving us the scoop appreciate it stay

01:07:36.340 --> 01:07:38.340
Stay tuned to orangehonestrader.com for more info.

01:07:38.340 --> 01:07:39.340
Alright, no prob.

01:07:39.340 --> 01:07:43.780
Peace out people and time to go listen and make some dinner on the meanwhile.

01:07:43.780 --> 01:07:44.780
Alright.

01:07:44.780 --> 01:07:45.780
Take care, buddy.

01:07:45.780 --> 01:07:46.780
Alright.

01:07:46.780 --> 01:07:47.780
Take it easy.

01:07:47.780 --> 01:07:48.780
Bye-bye.

01:07:48.780 --> 01:07:49.780
Alright.

01:07:49.780 --> 01:07:53.660
A little difficulty there with the connection it sounds like there, but Mel, we can clearly

01:07:53.660 --> 01:07:54.660
hear him.

01:07:54.660 --> 01:07:57.340
He's having a hard time understanding us, I think, but we can clearly hear him talking

01:07:57.340 --> 01:07:58.780
about BeatMania.

01:07:58.780 --> 01:08:03.980
Didn't end up actually getting shown at game until today, but it does look like that they

01:08:03.980 --> 01:08:09.220
They are going to call 2DX is the other mode in Beatmania.

01:08:09.220 --> 01:08:13.540
And then we have M2 Step 1 and all that.

01:08:13.540 --> 01:08:16.920
And actually, I don't know if he said 2DX was the other mode, or if he actually said

01:08:16.920 --> 01:08:17.920
it was 2DX.

01:08:17.920 --> 01:08:22.540
No, it's Beatmania 2DX, and it's also Beatmania.

01:08:22.540 --> 01:08:23.540
It's on all their screens.

01:08:23.540 --> 01:08:24.540
Damn, I was hoping for the other one.

01:08:24.540 --> 01:08:25.540
Is it in the screenshot there?

01:08:25.540 --> 01:08:26.540
No, it's in the screenshot.

01:08:26.540 --> 01:08:27.540
OK, all right.

01:08:27.540 --> 01:08:28.540
I wish, I wish.

01:08:28.540 --> 01:08:29.540
That would have been great.

01:08:29.540 --> 01:08:32.980
OK, but that's nice, though, that they call it at least 2DX and like a little bit of a

01:08:32.980 --> 01:08:39.980
throwback to what's going on the Japanese side. The M-2 Step song is in it, and...

01:08:39.980 --> 01:08:43.980
In My Eyes, Hitchhiker... Well, that's from these screencaps we see,

01:08:43.980 --> 01:08:47.460
right? Yeah, these are probably the latest build though. These are ones that are on Music

01:08:47.460 --> 01:08:57.600
in Every Direction. I Was The One, GMD, M-02 Step, Version 1.01... What a dumb name for

01:08:57.600 --> 01:09:01.320
a song

01:09:01.320 --> 01:09:04.520
shame what we are getting hammered on the skype line tonight we better have

01:09:04.520 --> 01:09:07.640
been get to another call higher on orange launch radio

01:09:07.640 --> 01:09:11.160
hey sky city where i think he was on your mind

01:09:11.160 --> 01:09:13.800
you forgot to mention the

01:09:13.800 --> 01:09:15.160

buckney is done who cares i don't care about the anymore

01:09:21.240 --> 01:09:24.800

01:09:24.800 --> 01:09:25.900

01:09:32.740 --> 01:09:34.740

Wow, I was very

01:09:38.620 --> 01:09:41.580
Excuse me. I wasn't major at one time. I know I know um

01:09:42.100 --> 01:09:47.340
But no, I I understand that the fanboys would be very pissed if he didn't show up. So we do have to mention some V

01:09:49.620 --> 01:09:53.000
Well other than that I had to make some correction

01:09:53.000 --> 01:10:03.040
okay um you said that the 2d x13 distorted location test is going on right

01:10:03.040 --> 01:10:08.680
now well actually it just finished right but it just finished yesterday oh yeah

01:10:08.680 --> 01:10:12.160
I just I remember reading I think you and Chad or somebody had said something

01:10:12.160 --> 01:10:16.880
that it had just finished but yeah it was going on so it just finished though

good okay alright yeah I'll definitely play that one what do you think about

01:10:49.200 --> 01:10:54.840
all this BeatMania US news hmm you know I was you know I was a little

01:10:54.840 --> 01:11:01.260
disappointed when I found out that it wasn't showed yesterday thanks to Rich

01:11:01.260 --> 01:11:08.960
who was there yesterday yeah a little a little technical foul up

01:11:08.960 --> 01:11:12.040
there but now we understand what's going on what do you think about the recording

01:11:12.040 --> 01:11:19.100
mode I think that's kind of interesting yeah I'll think about that but I wasn't

01:11:19.100 --> 01:11:23.620
surprised yeah seems like I guess I think I think it shows the Konami might

01:11:23.620 --> 01:11:26.620
be kind of looking on what's going out there on the internet right now like

01:11:26.620 --> 01:11:30.100
what are the fans of 2dx seem to really get into what do they want in the game

01:11:30.100 --> 01:11:34.220
and maybe they kind of picked up on the whole like you know vj-army tracking

01:11:34.220 --> 01:11:37.900
thing and maybe they thought it was something they could build into the game

01:11:37.900 --> 01:11:44.620
don't know just a thought I don't know yeah so well Ziggy anything else you

01:11:44.620 --> 01:11:51.740
want to share with us well nothing much else at the moment but uh yeah okay well

01:11:51.740 --> 01:11:54.460
thank I appreciate the call as always we're gonna get to some other calls

01:11:54.460 --> 01:11:57.740
because we're getting hammered tonight but have a good one okay buddy yeah all

01:11:57.740 --> 01:12:01.860
right later later all right Ziggy reminding us that

01:12:01.860 --> 01:12:06.340
Gita Dora v2 stuff is ready to go he sent us some songs from there so we're

01:12:06.340 --> 01:12:09.720
to check that out during the next break because I'm excited to hear some of the stuff so we're

01:12:09.720 --> 01:12:14.400
going to do that. Let's go to another call, lots and lots to pick from. Oh my gosh, I'm

01:12:14.400 --> 01:12:18.080
just going to pick the one that was on the line first. Hi, you're on Orange Laundry

01:12:18.080 --> 01:12:28.920
Radio. Hello. Hello. Hi, who is this? It's Nintendo Maniac 64. Hello Nintendo Maniac

01:12:28.920 --> 01:12:37.680
64 what's on your mind buddy playing Mario Kart as we speak awesome still

01:12:37.680 --> 01:12:43.120
playing are you are you able to find friends on there because every time I go

01:12:43.120 --> 01:12:46.880
in to do a friends matchup my friends are never online I don't even bother

01:12:46.880 --> 01:12:56.080
anymore I pretty much do rivals mode what right I haven't done rivals but I

01:12:56.080 --> 01:12:59.600
I hear that Rivals is a good way to find people at your own skill level, so I need to do that

01:12:59.600 --> 01:13:03.400
one more often, because otherwise I get my ass kicked almost every time.

01:13:03.400 --> 01:13:08.000
So I need to get matched up against some seven-year-olds, so I can have a sense of accomplishment when

01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:09.560
I actually, like, beat it.

01:13:09.560 --> 01:13:15.080
But you know, I actually played Mario Kart DS this last week, I played with several other

01:13:15.080 --> 01:13:21.520
people that have DS's, and we actually played the mode where you can broadcast the game,

01:13:21.520 --> 01:13:22.520
you can download the game.

01:13:22.520 --> 01:13:25.280
What I thought was kind of cool, and I haven't really seen this in a lot of DS games, is

01:13:25.280 --> 01:13:30.120
that you can mix and match, people that have the game and people that don't have the game,

01:13:30.120 --> 01:13:33.960
you can play multiplayer mode with people that do and don't have the game. And basically

01:13:33.960 --> 01:13:38.120
anybody that doesn't have the game will be a Shy Guy, which isn't even a character that

01:13:38.120 --> 01:13:40.740
you can unlock in the normal game. So I thought that was kind of weird because I hear the

01:13:40.740 --> 01:13:46.400
Shy Guy actually has like just a perfectly balanced average car. So my friends are actually

01:13:46.400 --> 01:13:49.540
doing very well with the Shy Guy cars, but everybody else who has the game will get to

01:13:49.540 --> 01:13:56.160
pick from any character, and unfortunately when you're playing with anybody that doesn't

01:13:56.160 --> 01:14:00.560
have the game, you can only pick from one battle track, and I think eight of the typical

01:14:00.560 --> 01:14:06.520
race courses. You can do anything in the first Retro Cup and in the first Mario DS Cup. So,

01:14:06.520 --> 01:14:10.760
it was interesting though, it's a good time. Yeah, Baby the Tiger is supposed to get like

01:14:10.760 --> 01:14:15.480
a bit of a handicap for those people who don't have it, so they don't have as much practice.

01:14:15.480 --> 01:14:17.160
I don't know.

01:14:17.160 --> 01:14:20.440
Oh, that might be a good point is that they do the balance car

01:14:20.440 --> 01:14:23.640
because those people don't have practice like the rest of us addicts do.

01:14:23.640 --> 01:14:29.040
That's a good thought. Are you going to be online with Animal Crossing this week?

01:14:29.040 --> 01:14:30.880
Uh...

01:14:30.880 --> 01:14:34.680
I might pick up the game but maybe not this week.

01:14:34.680 --> 01:14:36.280
I'm still kind of thinking about it

01:14:36.280 --> 01:14:39.160
because I didn't really...

01:14:39.160 --> 01:14:42.640
I'm not too much of an Animal Crossing fan but the online sounds really cool.

01:14:42.640 --> 01:14:50.640
I'm excited about this. We'll see. I can understand, though. Animal Crossing is a very quirky sort of game, so I can see where

01:14:50.640 --> 01:14:54.640
it might not be like you're jumping at the chance trying to get it, so okay.

01:14:54.640 --> 01:15:00.640
Yeah. But the online... Yeah, I'm very curious to see how the online stuff is going to work, too, because we don't really know.

01:15:00.640 --> 01:15:08.640
I mean, we hear how things are supposed to work, but we haven't really seen it in motion a whole lot except E3, which wasn't exactly

01:15:08.640 --> 01:15:11.800
a tell-all type situation so we'll see

01:15:11.800 --> 01:15:15.360
we'll see anything else you want to share with our listeners

01:15:15.360 --> 01:15:19.060
yeah my L button on my DS is crapped out

01:15:19.060 --> 01:15:23.320
that sucks can you do a warranty thing did you email Nintendo

01:15:23.320 --> 01:15:26.760
unfortunately my DS just came out of warranty

01:15:26.760 --> 01:15:30.060
ouch that is so typical

01:15:30.060 --> 01:15:33.520
but what?

01:15:33.520 --> 01:15:39.360
we got it on a credit card that will actually allow us to extend the warranty

01:15:39.360 --> 01:15:43.120
for just like I don't know how long but apparently they can cover it

01:15:43.120 --> 01:15:47.320
which is like really cool that's pretty awesome I'd never would have thought of

01:15:47.320 --> 01:15:49.200
that and that's actually probably a good tip

01:15:49.200 --> 01:15:52.800
especially this time of year for people that are listening

01:15:52.800 --> 01:15:56.400
if your shit breaks especially like god damn my microphone

01:15:56.400 --> 01:16:00.920
on if your stuff breaks ups a few if your stuff breaks

01:16:00.920 --> 01:16:04.360
Don't just check with the manufacturer, check with your credit card company because there

01:16:04.360 --> 01:16:13.360
may be some type of extension warranty or something else that might be available to

01:16:13.360 --> 01:16:14.360
you.

01:16:14.360 --> 01:16:18.520
Sorry to break your ears there.

01:16:18.520 --> 01:16:21.400
I swear to God, this mic is so fire.

01:16:21.400 --> 01:16:27.080
There might be something else available to you on your credit card warranty that goes

01:16:27.080 --> 01:16:29.000
beyond the manufacturer.

01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:30.640
There, finally.

01:16:30.640 --> 01:16:37.080
check out good tip thank you for reminding us okay all right yeah I

01:16:37.080 --> 01:16:41.760
pretty much just use the X button for items now that but see that's that's

01:16:41.760 --> 01:16:46.800
tough with the finger and everything I can't do that I need my L button I love

01:16:46.800 --> 01:16:51.720
my L button I yeah I mean at first I didn't think I'd be able to do it but

01:16:51.720 --> 01:16:57.460
all I do is I just move my my thumb is still holding it down a I'm just like my

01:16:57.460 --> 01:17:01.460
My nail actually hits the X button, not my actual finger.

01:17:01.460 --> 01:17:04.460
So if I cut my nails, I probably wouldn't be able to hit X.

01:17:04.460 --> 01:17:07.460
Well, a good incentive not to be biting those nails.

01:17:07.460 --> 01:17:08.460
Don't bite them nails.

01:17:08.460 --> 01:17:12.460
Yeah, except I just bit one of them.

01:17:12.460 --> 01:17:13.460
All right.

01:17:13.460 --> 01:17:14.460
All right.

01:17:14.460 --> 01:17:17.460
Oh, I got other stuff.

01:17:17.460 --> 01:17:18.460
Okay.

01:17:18.460 --> 01:17:24.460
Last night, I went on a huge StepMania song downloading spree.

01:17:24.460 --> 01:17:25.460
And what'd you find?

01:17:25.460 --> 01:17:26.460
Anything good?

01:17:26.460 --> 01:17:38.820
Um, yeah, um, I did find some, like, official DDR songs and stuff, like Butterfly, uh, Mr. Wonderful, things like those.

01:17:38.820 --> 01:17:41.580
That shit's old! That shit is so old!

01:17:41.580 --> 01:17:47.780
You know, I don't have any kind of Playstation and stuff, so I've never even played the songs, okay?

01:17:47.780 --> 01:17:53.860
Well, that's, that's where the simulator stuff can be kind of fun, is that you can download the old shit you might have missed out on, alright.

01:17:53.860 --> 01:17:59.860
Yeah, and I actually completely recreated Sandstorm on every difficulty.

01:17:59.860 --> 01:18:00.860
Wow.

01:18:00.860 --> 01:18:01.860
Yeah.

01:18:01.860 --> 01:18:06.860
That's a lot of Raven.

01:18:06.860 --> 01:18:13.860
Alright, well, Nintendo Maniac, we gotta let you go because we're gonna try and get at

01:18:13.860 --> 01:18:17.340
least one more call before we go to break, but thank you for calling in, and good luck

01:18:17.340 --> 01:18:18.340
with that L button.

01:18:18.340 --> 01:18:19.340
Thanks.

01:18:19.340 --> 01:18:20.340
Alright.

01:18:20.340 --> 01:18:21.340
Take care.

01:18:21.340 --> 01:18:22.340
By the way, I'm winning.

01:18:22.340 --> 01:18:23.340
By the way, what?

01:18:23.340 --> 01:18:24.340
I'm winning.

01:18:24.340 --> 01:18:25.340
Good.

01:18:25.340 --> 01:18:26.340
Well, kick some ass.

01:18:26.340 --> 01:18:27.340
Kick some ass.

01:18:27.340 --> 01:18:28.340
Kick some ass.

01:18:28.340 --> 01:18:29.340
Kick some ass.

01:18:29.340 --> 01:18:30.340
Have fun, buddy.

01:18:30.340 --> 01:18:31.340
Yeah.

01:18:31.340 --> 01:18:32.340
Later.

01:18:32.340 --> 01:18:36.340
One more call, call, call, call.

01:18:36.340 --> 01:18:37.340
Let's see.

01:18:37.340 --> 01:18:38.340
How about this one?

01:18:38.340 --> 01:18:39.340
Hi, everyone.

01:18:39.340 --> 01:18:41.340
It's on the radio.

01:18:41.340 --> 01:18:44.340
Hey, this is SSJ100 Matt here.

01:18:44.340 --> 01:18:46.340
Hello, SSJ100 Matt here.

01:18:46.340 --> 01:18:48.340
What's on your mind?

01:18:48.340 --> 01:18:52.340
Actually, I got some minor news for myself.

01:18:52.340 --> 01:19:00.340
I got special advanced press screenings to the movie Grandma's Boy.

01:19:00.340 --> 01:19:06.340
Grandma's Boy? Oh, this is the Adam Sandler movie where he plays like a game tester or something, huh?

01:19:06.340 --> 01:19:09.340
Did you actually see the movie?

01:19:09.340 --> 01:19:14.340
Well, no, the advanced screening is for this Thursday.

01:19:14.340 --> 01:19:18.340
Is that Adam Sandler? What's his name? I don't remember the guy's name.

01:19:18.340 --> 01:19:19.340
Rob Schneider?

01:19:19.340 --> 01:19:20.340
That's not Rob Schneider.

01:19:20.340 --> 01:19:21.340
I thought it was Adam Sandler.

01:19:21.340 --> 01:19:22.340
I know him.

01:19:22.340 --> 01:19:24.340
No, it's Happy Madison.

01:19:24.340 --> 01:19:25.340
Alan something.

01:19:25.340 --> 01:19:30.340
Happy Madison is the one doing the production on it.

01:19:30.340 --> 01:19:33.340
I don't remember who's the maker.

01:19:33.340 --> 01:19:34.340
Well, some person.

01:19:34.340 --> 01:19:38.340
So how did you manage to get this ticket?

01:19:38.340 --> 01:19:48.340
Well, the television studio that I worked at was giving out, like, okay, we have 12 tickets, who wants them?

01:19:48.340 --> 01:19:50.340
And I just jumped on top of two, so...

01:19:50.340 --> 01:19:54.340
Well, that was easy. Those fell in your lap, didn't they? That must be nice.

01:19:54.340 --> 01:20:01.340
Yeah. So, the premiere is Thursday, and they're going to make a big deal out of it,

01:20:01.340 --> 01:20:03.220
deal out of and they're going to have uh...

01:20:03.220 --> 01:20:05.380
e sports uh...

01:20:05.380 --> 01:20:06.500
going to be uh...

01:20:06.500 --> 01:20:10.580
uh... showing off games uh... before the screening

01:20:10.580 --> 01:20:13.300
very cool i'm looking at some of these people who are in the movie i don't

01:20:13.300 --> 01:20:15.420
recognize any of these people at all

01:20:15.420 --> 01:20:18.940
hope there's robschneider isn't it and david spade and have a new and all this

01:20:18.940 --> 01:20:22.340
is like an early nineties saturday night live thing going on here

01:20:22.340 --> 01:20:25.540
yet on the old woman from uh...

01:20:25.540 --> 01:20:28.780
doris roberts one of the most roman yam

01:20:28.780 --> 01:20:32.660
OK, I'm trying to look at the poster here.

01:20:32.660 --> 01:20:34.060
I love Internet Movie Database.

01:20:34.060 --> 01:20:35.820
Answers all my movie questions.

01:20:35.820 --> 01:20:37.180
And they didn't pay me to say that even.

01:20:37.180 --> 01:20:40.460
I really do love this one.

01:20:40.460 --> 01:20:41.660
Linda Cardellini.

01:20:41.660 --> 01:20:44.380
Oh, they've got a lot of people in this movie.

01:20:44.380 --> 01:20:48.780
OK, well, that should be interesting.

01:20:48.780 --> 01:20:54.100
And supposedly Kevin Nealon's supposed to show up, so

01:20:54.100 --> 01:20:57.580
hopefully I can give him my business card or something so

01:20:57.580 --> 01:21:02.520
they can hire me for a movie or something. It's the Hollywood way, it'll be awesome.

01:21:02.520 --> 01:21:06.720
What was I going to say about this movie? You'll call back and let us know if it's good

01:21:06.720 --> 01:21:14.040
or not, right? Next week? Yeah, next week. Sounds good. Anything else you want to share

01:21:14.040 --> 01:21:17.500
with our listeners, besides rubbing it in that you get to go to a movie premiere and

01:21:17.500 --> 01:21:25.880
we don't? Well, the movie comes out January 6th, so...

01:21:25.880 --> 01:21:31.600
That's not a good sign, because January is when the studios unload their crap.

01:21:31.600 --> 01:21:33.600
Didn't Resident Evil 2 come out in January?

01:21:33.600 --> 01:21:37.440
No, but a wonderful movie called BloodRayne is coming out in January.

01:21:37.440 --> 01:21:40.440
Like I said, that's when the studios unload all their crap.

01:21:40.440 --> 01:21:42.760
No, I don't know, it might be fun.

01:21:42.760 --> 01:21:47.600
Just let us know if it makes gamers look like dumbasses or not, because I'm very interested

01:21:47.600 --> 01:21:53.600
to see what happens with another gaming movie and all that stuff, so.

01:21:53.600 --> 01:21:55.600
All right, but uh

01:21:56.320 --> 01:22:01.760
Yeah, but yeah, that's it. Okay. Well, thanks for calling in have fun at the movie. Let us know how it goes. All righty

01:22:02.960 --> 01:22:05.280
All right. All right. Later. All right. Bye

01:22:05.840 --> 01:22:07.360
Yep, bye

01:22:07.360 --> 01:22:09.000
Okay

01:22:09.000 --> 01:22:13.460
Call there from SSJ 100 Matt who by the way is looking for a job in the industry

01:22:13.460 --> 01:22:15.460
So if you know a rich producer

01:22:17.560 --> 01:22:19.560
He wants a job so give him a job

01:22:19.560 --> 01:22:28.560
We want a job too, actually. We could use a job. I would sell My Immortal Soul to do Orange Lounge on TV or something. That would be fun.

01:22:28.560 --> 01:22:31.560
I don't know how to do it on TV. I like the radio.

01:22:31.560 --> 01:22:36.560
The radio is fun, but the whole world needs to see my sexy butt is what it really boils down to.

01:22:39.560 --> 01:22:45.560
Alright, anyway, just teasing kids. We're going to go to a break because we need a break. I need to get up and stretch and air out a little bit.

01:22:45.560 --> 01:22:50.400
air out a little bit. So we're going to play some songs, as promised, from Gita Doda V

01:22:50.400 --> 01:22:57.000
2. So we're going to hear Vanilla Ninja with Metal Queen, because that song sounds awesome.

01:22:57.000 --> 01:23:02.440
We're going to hear a song by a group called Twinkle Berry, because it's called Twinkle

01:23:02.440 --> 01:23:06.320
Berry. How can it be bad? It sounds too much like Dingle Berry. And then I'm curious, we're

01:23:06.320 --> 01:23:10.440
going to hear a Tara song, and I'm really curious if model DD7 has anything to do with

01:23:10.440 --> 01:23:14.200
the other model song that's been in it. Yes, it does. Good, then we'll hear it. There's

01:23:14.200 --> 01:23:18.560
been like tons of them. Alright, well we'll see. So we'll be back after this with more

01:23:18.560 --> 01:23:25.560
Orange launch radio and maybe some more skype if you kids are good.

01:23:48.560 --> 01:23:50.560
I'm finding my friend a poison

01:23:50.560 --> 01:23:53.560
To lose all the blood that I...

01:23:53.560 --> 01:23:55.560
Oh...

01:23:55.560 --> 01:23:57.560
Thank you in the light

01:23:59.560 --> 01:24:01.560
Master Queen

01:24:01.560 --> 01:24:04.560
She's gonna break us

01:24:04.560 --> 01:24:06.560
Oh...

01:24:06.560 --> 01:24:09.560
You're a mystic alive

01:24:10.560 --> 01:24:12.560
Master Queen

01:24:12.560 --> 01:24:15.560
I'll be the star

01:24:15.560 --> 01:24:20.560
When I'm all up for the love of mine

01:24:20.560 --> 01:24:22.560
Yeah

01:24:22.560 --> 01:24:45.560
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

01:24:45.560 --> 01:24:50.560
You're a queen, you're a queen of love

01:24:50.560 --> 01:24:56.560
Oh, you're a victory for life

01:24:56.560 --> 01:25:01.560
That's my queen, I'm in the sky

01:25:01.560 --> 01:25:05.560
We're all alone for the love of night

01:25:35.560 --> 01:25:42.560
Naka te mo taruto nante Masani hato ito meduyo ne

01:25:42.560 --> 01:25:49.560

Beni mukate

Sae kim kun tota, dan te kare ga yu hu

Deli kashi no naiko no shi toko sode

Kiru sui ita no mota be nai no mota be ho

01:26:46.080 --> 01:26:49.080
Watashi wa amato o yo

01:26:49.080 --> 01:26:53.880
Yuto yo hi amato o ne te mo odome wa

01:26:53.880 --> 01:26:59.560
We are all the same, all except for our own

01:29:53.880 --> 01:29:55.880
Oh

01:30:23.880 --> 01:30:51.080
The

01:30:51.080 --> 01:30:53.820
Even if we stay hard

01:30:53.820 --> 01:30:57.820
But do they ever tell me?

01:31:23.820 --> 01:31:25.820
It's

01:32:25.820 --> 01:32:55.260
For the next slide to Orange Lab, this GDR sucks!

01:32:55.260 --> 01:33:02.260
all

01:33:03.960 --> 01:33:07.340
We're back to Orange Lounge Radio and in that break we heard a

01:33:07.340 --> 01:33:10.560
Whole Cluster Fucka music from Gitadora V2

01:33:10.560 --> 01:33:14.280
and I understand that people are leaving

01:33:14.280 --> 01:33:18.220
listening to our show to go watch other things on television like the Boondocks

01:33:18.220 --> 01:33:22.460
or a Family Guy. TV addicts you need to get all of your butts.

01:33:22.460 --> 01:33:25.460
You bitches need to get a TiVo or a BitTorrent.

01:33:25.460 --> 01:33:26.460
Screw TiVo!

01:33:26.460 --> 01:33:28.460
BitTorrent, yeah, BitTorrent is the way to go.

01:33:28.460 --> 01:33:30.460
It's on before the show is even on.

01:33:30.460 --> 01:33:32.460
It's on demand, is what it is.

01:33:32.460 --> 01:33:37.460
You can literally, if you have news groups, I do this almost every week.

01:33:37.460 --> 01:33:41.460
When I get done with the show, I go watch my episode of Family Guy.

01:33:41.460 --> 01:33:42.460
There you go.

01:33:42.460 --> 01:33:43.460
After the show!

01:33:43.460 --> 01:33:45.460
That's how you do it.

01:33:45.460 --> 01:33:47.460
So I'm just poking fun at people that dare ditch us.

01:33:47.460 --> 01:33:49.460
TiVo is evil.

01:33:49.460 --> 01:33:51.460
Because the government has access to it.

01:33:51.460 --> 01:33:54.460
Oh no, the government knows I watch Will and Grace.

01:33:54.460 --> 01:33:57.460
What am I going to do?

01:33:57.460 --> 01:33:58.460
Tevo knows you're gay now.

01:33:58.460 --> 01:34:00.460
The government might think I'm gay.

01:34:00.460 --> 01:34:03.460
Although Will and Grace is, you know, it's so...

01:34:03.460 --> 01:34:04.460
I don't know how to call it.

01:34:04.460 --> 01:34:05.460
It's not really whitewashed.

01:34:05.460 --> 01:34:08.460
It's black and whitewashed instead of rainbow.

01:34:08.460 --> 01:34:11.460
It's black and whitewashed is what Will and Grace is.

01:34:11.460 --> 01:34:16.460
It's grayscaled, basically.

01:34:16.460 --> 01:34:21.980
Anyway, um, do-do-do-do-do-do-do, where were we going?

01:34:21.980 --> 01:34:26.780
Uh, I'm driving this car, turning it around.

01:34:26.780 --> 01:34:30.300
Oh yeah, uh, I was going to get to the cage match

01:34:30.300 --> 01:34:33.660
pretty soon here, because I know we want to do a cage match. You have a song, right?

01:34:33.660 --> 01:34:34.180
Because...

01:34:34.180 --> 01:34:38.860
Well, of course I have a song, because I didn't win last week. I know, just making sure, because I hadn't seen it yet.

01:34:38.860 --> 01:34:42.220
Just making sure you had a song somewhere. Alright, um,

01:34:42.220 --> 01:34:47.780
I want to mention this really quick though, which I think, oh, two things I want to mention

01:34:47.780 --> 01:34:50.940
real quick. Somebody brought it up in the chat room during break and I was talking about

01:34:50.940 --> 01:34:57.300
Energies at the top of the show, or Energies, Energies drinks at the top of the show and

01:34:57.300 --> 01:35:00.980
somebody in chat reminded us about the Final Fantasy Energies drink that's coming out called

01:35:00.980 --> 01:35:05.580
Potion. Have you heard of this? I swear to God I'm not making this shit up. There's this

01:35:05.580 --> 01:35:09.060
new Energies drink out, coming out called, wait, somebody give me a web link. I read

01:35:09.060 --> 01:35:13.700
about this on the entire potion in tarnet high potion will be the one

01:35:13.700 --> 01:35:20.380
that's like I don't know diet or something we'll see I want an ether I

01:35:20.380 --> 01:35:29.540
want Phoenix down let's see there it is Final Fantasy 12 potion and this is what

01:35:29.540 --> 01:35:33.940
it is it's a it's a food tie in there and we're looking at it there is this on

01:35:33.940 --> 01:35:40.020
on Gamebrink.com is what it is here. It's some type of tie-in to Final Fantasy 12 here.

01:35:40.020 --> 01:35:44.700
I wish I could zoom in on the product. It looks an awful lot like balls or Powerade,

01:35:44.700 --> 01:35:47.720
but actually I like the play on it because it looks like it's actually like in a potion

01:35:47.720 --> 01:35:52.460
or something. March 2006 is when this stuff goes on sale.

01:35:52.460 --> 01:35:58.500
The drink supposedly makes you relax like herb tea and tastes mystical. It contains

01:35:58.500 --> 01:36:03.680
nutritional supplements so that the company can claim the drinker might recover real-life

01:36:03.680 --> 01:36:19.440
hit points. And if you drink this, you're a nerd. A really big nerd. Just kidding. What

01:36:19.440 --> 01:36:27.800
can you do? Will I go up a level? Will I do the little dance? Will I throw my arms up?

01:36:27.800 --> 01:36:31.260
Have you played the Final Fantasy 12 demo? I like the bottles. Wait, have you played

01:36:31.260 --> 01:36:36.420
the Final Fantasy XII demo? No, and I'm not going to, because I played it... It's sexy.

01:36:36.420 --> 01:36:40.160
It's different than the E3 one. It's way different. Not from what everybody in the universe else

01:36:40.160 --> 01:36:45.680
has told me? Nope. They're lying. All of them. Okay. Alright. I like these bottles. They're

01:36:45.680 --> 01:36:50.240
cool. I'll get it just for the bottles. What else did I want to mention? Oh, yes. Final

01:36:50.240 --> 01:36:56.120
Fantasy. On the cell phones, you guys pretty soon are going to be able to play DDR. Why

01:36:56.120 --> 01:37:00.440
you would want to play DDR on your cell phone is beyond me, but they are, they were showing

01:37:00.440 --> 01:37:04.440
this supposedly at the Game Festival, and I completely forgot to ask Mel about this

01:37:04.440 --> 01:37:08.080
because he was there, but he probably wasn't even looking for it because, my God, who gives

01:37:08.080 --> 01:37:14.320
a shit about mobile gaming? I know I don't. But we actually ran a story about this on

01:37:14.320 --> 01:37:19.120
orangelunchmedia.com. This part of it is kind of old news that you can buy the mobile ringtones

01:37:19.120 --> 01:37:25.520
that feature DDR songs, but what may be kind of news to you is that they did show in the

01:37:25.520 --> 01:37:27.840
games on the go area of the game festival

01:37:27.840 --> 01:37:30.440
that there will be doing DDR on mobile phones

01:37:30.440 --> 01:37:33.760
this is probably just a port of what we've seen happen in japan because i

01:37:33.760 --> 01:37:35.520
believe they already have this in japan

01:37:35.520 --> 01:37:38.880
uh... yeah a couple and they have like max three hundred

01:37:38.880 --> 01:37:40.200
i've seen

01:37:40.200 --> 01:37:43.320
oh you got a bigger picture

01:37:43.320 --> 01:37:45.040
that looks interesting

01:37:45.040 --> 01:37:47.960
okay sorry jamie was showing me the potions

01:37:47.960 --> 01:37:51.360
so yeah what can i say it's DDR on the cell phone but funny enough the screenshot

01:37:51.360 --> 01:37:53.640
i saw was max three hundred

01:37:53.640 --> 01:37:57.380
And why you would want to play that on a cell phone, I have no idea, especially if there's

01:37:57.380 --> 01:37:58.380
no dance pad hookup.

01:37:58.380 --> 01:38:00.740
That's like an exercise in futility.

01:38:00.740 --> 01:38:03.700
Even if there was a dance pad hookup, that would be stupid.

01:38:03.700 --> 01:38:10.700
The only use I would see for this is if you are a freestyler who needs your steps on the

01:38:10.700 --> 01:38:12.700
go.

01:38:12.700 --> 01:38:16.180
Like if you're going to be in an upcoming tournament or something, you need to take

01:38:16.180 --> 01:38:19.660
a quick look at those steps before you go up on stage, like one more time, run through

01:38:19.660 --> 01:38:23.260
the routine in your mind, that's where DDR on the cell phone would be a good idea.

01:38:23.260 --> 01:38:27.260
the rest of this crap

01:38:27.260 --> 01:38:28.740
but whatever

01:38:28.740 --> 01:38:31.100
I'll probably buy it anyway because I'm a consumer horror

01:38:31.100 --> 01:38:34.280
honestly

01:38:34.280 --> 01:38:37.040
Jamie's showing me the bigger pictures of potion

01:38:37.040 --> 01:38:39.020
that looks very nice

01:38:39.020 --> 01:38:40.780
looks pretty, pretty bottles

01:38:40.780 --> 01:38:44.260
I would rather buy a lot of Final Fantasy potion than DDR on the cell phone

01:38:44.260 --> 01:38:49.380
that's for sure

01:38:49.380 --> 01:38:51.540
anywho

01:38:51.540 --> 01:38:53.660
Let's do tonight's cage match, shall we?

01:38:53.660 --> 01:38:57.540
It's where we put three songs in battle against each other to the death

01:38:57.540 --> 01:39:00.020
and there are fatalities involved

01:39:00.020 --> 01:39:02.660
and one song emerges as the victor.

01:39:02.660 --> 01:39:06.020
And you guys in chat have the final say on which one of these songs is the winner.

01:39:06.020 --> 01:39:09.220
The winning song, by the way, goes into rotation all week long.

01:39:09.220 --> 01:39:11.420
All freaking week long on Orange Lawn Radio's

01:39:11.420 --> 01:39:14.600
Bomani and Video Game Music program, which is awesome.

01:39:14.600 --> 01:39:16.940
So let's get it started, shall we?

01:39:16.940 --> 01:39:20.020
Sure.

01:39:20.020 --> 01:39:26.980
Last week in the Orange Songs Radio Cage Match, an old friend band of Jamie's made it, a friendly

01:39:26.980 --> 01:39:28.580
old band, a jolly old time.

01:39:28.580 --> 01:39:32.900
Blur was the band, and the song was called Crazy Beat.

01:39:32.900 --> 01:39:36.460
Is it crazy enough to win for a second week in a row?

01:39:36.460 --> 01:39:39.220
I don't know, we'll see.

01:39:39.220 --> 01:39:43.180
So we're going to play a clip for you guys so you can judge if you like this or not and

01:39:43.180 --> 01:39:44.780
want it to win for the second week in a row.

01:39:44.780 --> 01:39:48.620
So here it is, song one, it's a nice Cage Match Blur with Crazy Beat.

01:39:48.620 --> 01:39:49.620
Enjoy.

01:39:49.620 --> 01:40:04.620
I like my brothers on Saturday night, yeah

01:40:04.620 --> 01:40:05.620
Yeah!

01:40:18.920 --> 01:40:19.920
Breakdown!

01:40:25.420 --> 01:40:29.420
I'm on my own about to turn a little crazy again

01:40:29.920 --> 01:40:32.920
I'm dying here for a money I spent

01:40:32.920 --> 01:40:54.240
I love my sister and I love her tonight

01:40:54.240 --> 01:41:07.980
That's withstandation and it can't be President

01:41:08.020 --> 01:41:15.400
Break-up in me

01:41:45.400 --> 01:42:01.680
Song numero uno in tonight's cage match, blur with crazy beats.

01:42:01.680 --> 01:42:04.340
You only get a clip of that though because if you wanted to hear the whole thing you

01:42:04.340 --> 01:42:06.920
should have been listening last week, honestly, kids.

01:42:06.920 --> 01:42:10.720
Alright, song number two in tonight's cage match comes to us via the Loki.

01:42:10.720 --> 01:42:13.720
Loki, what did you pick for us tonight, sir?

01:42:15.720 --> 01:42:19.720
I picked something from Alien 3.16, which is interesting.

01:42:19.720 --> 01:42:24.720
See, they should have been Alien 3.14, because then they should have been Alien Pie.

01:42:26.720 --> 01:42:27.720
I'm lame. Shut up.

01:42:27.720 --> 01:42:38.720
Anyways, yeah, so this is a song from Alien 3.16, which you might remember from UltraMix 1 with C Square, or wait, UltraMix 2. I take that back.

01:42:38.720 --> 01:42:40.720
By the way, it's Alien 613.

01:42:40.720 --> 01:42:44.720
613, whatever, 313, whatever, who gives a crap?

01:42:44.720 --> 01:42:45.720
Alien and some number...

01:42:45.720 --> 01:42:48.720
Anyways, this is the song All For Nothing.

01:42:48.720 --> 01:42:50.720
Alright.

01:42:50.720 --> 01:42:57.720
Alien number 613 was all for nothing. Enjoy song number two.

01:43:20.720 --> 01:43:27.720
Money

01:43:27.720 --> 01:43:32.720
Cars

01:43:32.720 --> 01:43:36.720
Breathing

01:43:36.720 --> 01:43:39.720
Cellular phones

01:44:09.720 --> 01:44:11.720
My

01:44:11.720 --> 01:44:13.720
You

01:44:13.720 --> 01:44:15.720
My

01:44:15.720 --> 01:44:17.720
You

01:44:17.720 --> 01:44:19.720
My

01:44:19.720 --> 01:44:21.720
You

01:44:21.720 --> 01:44:23.720
My

01:44:23.720 --> 01:44:25.720
Love

01:44:25.720 --> 01:44:27.720
My

01:44:27.720 --> 01:44:29.720
Breathe

01:44:29.720 --> 01:44:31.720
My

01:44:31.720 --> 01:44:33.720
My

01:44:33.720 --> 01:44:35.720
You

01:44:35.720 --> 01:44:37.720
My

01:45:07.720 --> 01:45:09.720
Fucking hell with you

01:45:39.720 --> 01:46:08.720
Yeah, I do what it be Yeah, I do what it be

01:46:08.720 --> 01:46:36.500
You and I, you and I, you and I, you and I.

01:46:38.720 --> 01:46:50.920
The song numero dos in tonight's cage match, Alien number 613 with All For Nothing, not

01:46:50.920 --> 01:46:55.040
to be confused with the Cher song All or Nothing, two very, very different songs I would just

01:46:55.040 --> 01:46:56.040
like to point out.

01:46:56.040 --> 01:47:02.960
Dark Sakura, was that a number 10 or a number 2?

01:47:02.960 --> 01:47:04.640
It was more like a number 5.

01:47:04.640 --> 01:47:05.640
Okay.

01:47:05.640 --> 01:47:24.640
loki What did you think of all or nothing?

01:47:35.640 --> 01:47:41.640
Six? I don't know, whatever. I really had nothing this week that I hadn't already picked.

01:47:41.640 --> 01:47:45.640
You know, I thought that song was pretty good for me to poop on.

01:47:45.640 --> 01:47:47.640
No, I give it a four.

01:47:47.640 --> 01:47:53.640
Alright, let's move on to song number three. Song number three tonight is my pick.

01:47:53.640 --> 01:47:58.640
And I also picked a former Romani artist because I like this song. It's pretty.

01:47:58.640 --> 01:48:02.640
It's actually a song that she actually released in the U.S.

01:48:02.640 --> 01:48:08.320
It's Tess, and the song is called The Second You Sleep, I Stay To Watch You Fade Away.

01:48:08.320 --> 01:48:12.720
And, um, Tess of course did Justify My Love and all that stuff for DDR.

01:48:12.720 --> 01:48:16.160
So here it is, Tess, here on Orange Lounge Radio, song number three.

01:48:17.440 --> 01:48:26.480
You close your eyes, and leave me naked by your side.

01:48:26.480 --> 01:48:37.480
You close the door so I can see The love you keep inside

01:48:37.480 --> 01:48:44.480
The love you keep for me

01:48:44.480 --> 01:48:54.480
It fills me up It feels like living in a dream

01:48:57.480 --> 01:49:05.480
It fills me up so I can see The love you keep inside

01:49:05.480 --> 01:49:12.480
Love you keep on me

01:49:12.480 --> 01:49:22.480
I say to watch you fade away I dream of you tonight

01:49:22.480 --> 01:49:29.480
Tomorrow you'll be gone It gives me time to say

01:49:29.480 --> 01:49:36.480
To watch you fade away I dream of you tonight

01:49:36.480 --> 01:49:39.980
Tomorrow you'll be gone

01:49:39.980 --> 01:49:46.980
I wish my God would stay

01:49:47.980 --> 01:49:50.980
I'll stay awake

01:49:52.980 --> 01:49:56.980
I'll stay awake and watch you breathe

01:49:59.980 --> 01:50:03.980
I'll stay awake and watch you come

01:50:03.980 --> 01:50:14.980
Away into the night, I'll get through your dreams

01:50:15.980 --> 01:50:24.980
I'll say to watch you fade away, I dream of you tonight

01:50:24.980 --> 01:50:28.740
Tomorrow you'll be gone

01:50:28.740 --> 01:50:31.940
It gives me time to say

01:50:31.940 --> 01:50:35.460
To watch you fade away

01:50:35.460 --> 01:50:38.900
I dream of you tonight

01:50:38.900 --> 01:50:42.500
Tomorrow you'll be gone

01:50:42.500 --> 01:50:49.940
I wish my God would stay

01:50:49.940 --> 01:50:55.940
Hey

01:50:57.940 --> 01:51:02.940
I stay to watch you fade away

01:51:02.940 --> 01:51:05.940
I dream of you tonight

01:51:05.940 --> 01:51:09.940
Tomorrow you'll be gone

01:51:09.940 --> 01:51:12.940
It gives me time to stay

01:51:12.940 --> 01:51:16.940
To watch you fade away

01:51:16.940 --> 01:51:20.440
I dream of you tonight

01:51:20.440 --> 01:51:23.940
Tomorrow you'll be gone

01:51:23.940 --> 01:51:27.440
I wish by God you'd stay

01:51:27.440 --> 01:51:30.940
To watch you fade away

01:51:30.940 --> 01:51:34.440
I dream of you tonight

01:51:34.440 --> 01:51:38.440
Tomorrow you'll be gone

01:51:38.440 --> 01:51:43.440
I wish by god you'd say

01:52:08.440 --> 01:52:15.440
was not as annoying as the usual one, so it gives a 7.

01:52:38.440 --> 01:52:45.680
Alright, let us recap shall we, the three songs you can vote for tonight in tonight's

01:52:45.680 --> 01:52:46.680
cage match.

01:52:58.280 --> 01:53:12.800
Or you can vote for song number 2, Alien number 613 with All For Nothing.

01:53:16.960 --> 01:53:23.960

Please vote now. Send a private message to Skye in the chat room with your vote

01:53:34.000 --> 01:53:37.920
for song numero uno dos or tres.

01:53:37.920 --> 01:53:42.520
And we will see which song emerges victorious.

01:53:42.520 --> 01:53:46.080
New Orleans Radio Cage. This is the part of the show where I go over to Loki and I say hey

01:53:46.080 --> 01:53:50.580
Hey, Loki. You know that sim scene that's out there where people are like playing Beat

01:53:50.580 --> 01:53:54.900
Mania on their PSPs and shit? What is going on in the sim scene? Because I could care

01:53:54.900 --> 01:53:58.880
less, but I know our listeners want to know. So, Loki, what's up?

01:53:58.880 --> 01:54:04.540
Just more stuff with DDR OSC4. They're now in their In the Groove division, and they

01:54:04.540 --> 01:54:10.900
have the results for the keyboard division of sim files out there. I don't know what

01:54:10.900 --> 01:54:14.840
the difference would be with In the Groove sim files. I guess that's not quite impossible,

01:54:14.840 --> 01:54:22.520
but pretty impossible. I don't know. But anyways, if anyone cares, I will go into the results

01:54:22.520 --> 01:54:28.080
here of who won the keyboard section, which I don't even really, I haven't checked out

01:54:28.080 --> 01:54:34.360
any of the entries, so God knows. Oh, and it doesn't exist. Okay, anyways, in other...

01:54:34.360 --> 01:54:37.840
That's one of those Bemani style bug things, like you can't log in on the forums or it

01:54:37.840 --> 01:54:42.760
poops out. It's weird. Anyways, who cares? Someone won. I have a secret account on Bemani

01:54:42.760 --> 01:54:49.760
I'm not actually Sky because somehow I got locked out of that account, like I can't get in it or access it all, so I have a secret name.

01:54:49.760 --> 01:54:50.760
Secret!

01:54:50.760 --> 01:54:58.760
Anyways, on top of that, the other thing was all these sim files for Ultramix 3 have been released.

01:54:58.760 --> 01:55:00.760
All of them.

01:55:00.760 --> 01:55:04.760
Oh good! That means all the MP3s are out there so people can stop whining for them.

01:55:04.760 --> 01:55:06.760
Yes, they are. I have them.

01:55:06.760 --> 01:55:16.760
But no, they're up there. You can find them at BomaniISO.com. I think that's what it was. Whatever that Bittorrent tracker was, it has all the stuff that people steal and stuff.

01:55:18.760 --> 01:55:25.760
Yay. I don't know. That's all that's going on, really. Dead.

01:55:26.760 --> 01:55:31.760
Alright. Well, it's Christmas. You know, everybody's taking a break from the sim scene because, you know, they're bored.

01:55:31.760 --> 01:55:40.680
their board. What? However, we do have to, in a typical fashion, it is time to see how

01:55:40.680 --> 01:55:49.060
many really bad Max remixes have been released this week, by myself. Anyways, this is starting

01:55:49.060 --> 01:55:55.220
off. And of course, if you guys were looking for those 2DX distorted clips, you can actually

01:55:55.220 --> 01:55:59.660
find them in their media shop. They have four different videos on there, so you can check

01:55:59.660 --> 01:56:04.900
those out. But, if you really want to check out what everybody is looking for, and that's

01:56:04.900 --> 01:56:10.920
really horrible Max remixes, you can also check those out in their Simphile form there.

01:56:10.920 --> 01:56:16.160
And let's see, for this week, looks like it's been a pretty light week actually. We've got

01:56:16.160 --> 01:56:24.160
MaxMax, MaxStink, Max340, MaxWizard, MaxAttack.

01:56:24.160 --> 01:56:25.160
Twice.

01:56:25.160 --> 01:56:26.160
MaxMyButt.

01:56:26.160 --> 01:56:27.160
Yeah.

01:56:27.160 --> 01:56:32.480
That would be it.

01:56:32.480 --> 01:56:36.240
And Paranoia FartMix.

01:56:36.240 --> 01:56:37.240
Not yet.

01:56:37.240 --> 01:56:38.240
I didn't check and see who my Paranoia remixes are.

01:56:38.240 --> 01:56:40.680
I'm still waiting for the Safari Transmix.

01:56:40.680 --> 01:56:43.560
Keep waiting.

01:56:43.560 --> 01:56:50.560
So get your safari transmix before I'll get my xbox 360.

01:56:51.120 --> 01:56:54.680
And there it is.

01:56:54.680 --> 01:56:59.640
I'd fill time but I'm tallying cage match votes so it's up to you guys for right now.

01:56:59.640 --> 01:57:04.600
And of course, you know, to cover the wonderful Paranoia remixes we have Paranoia Survivor

01:57:04.600 --> 01:57:11.600
Another, Paranoia Trick Master Edit, Paranoia Survivor Max 580, Paranoia Sky, Paranoia Agent

01:57:11.600 --> 01:57:16.120
agent theme. That one I'm kind of interested in, let's see what that is.

01:57:16.120 --> 01:57:27.120
Paranoia Eternal Frees. Paranoia Zombie, or, Ortelda Paranoia. Yeah. Nice. I don't know,

01:57:27.120 --> 01:57:34.960
it's lame. I want Max the Final, and then I want Konami to threaten to sue anyone who

01:57:34.960 --> 01:57:39.920
puts out another Max remix, and so people can't do it anymore. Because I just, I'm sick

01:57:39.920 --> 01:57:45.680
max remixes. I really am. It's Maximizer now. Don't you know? Whatever. Fuck Maximizer.

01:57:45.680 --> 01:57:50.840
Maximizer wasn't even a freaking Max remix at all. Fuck Maximizer. Fuck Joni and Spesh.

01:57:50.840 --> 01:57:57.840
Max Super Max. Insaner. Max my ass. Whatever that is. Fuck Max. Fuck Legend of Max. Seriously.

01:57:58.320 --> 01:58:02.680
They should call, they should make one called Extremer. What was the middle one? I don't

01:58:02.680 --> 01:58:07.760
even remember what the real ones are called anymore. There was Max 300. Max Unlimited.

01:58:07.760 --> 01:58:10.400
unlimited should've been where it stopped. That should've been the last one.

01:58:10.400 --> 01:58:15.160
Now, The Legend of Max was a good place to stop it, because that was cool. It was kind

01:58:15.160 --> 01:58:16.360
of a song to wrap it up.

01:58:16.360 --> 01:58:17.360
Fine.

01:58:17.360 --> 01:58:19.960
And Paranoia, like, Paranoia, Respect, that was a good one to end it on also.

01:58:19.960 --> 01:58:20.960
Oh, fine. Then that should be it.

01:58:20.960 --> 01:58:21.960
Then it should be done.

01:58:21.960 --> 01:58:22.960
Done.

01:58:22.960 --> 01:58:28.840
And same with B4U. B4U was a good point to stop, you know, those remakes as well.

01:58:28.840 --> 01:58:36.200
And what the fuck was that Max song that was in the Max Heart Attack one in the extreme

01:58:36.200 --> 01:58:37.200
Japan?

01:58:37.200 --> 01:58:50.440
period. That was bullshit. That was absolute bullshit. Max period makes me on my period.

01:58:50.440 --> 01:59:00.560
Alright. Anyway. We are going to go to a small break, and when we come back from this small

01:59:00.560 --> 01:59:05.360
break, we might do some more Skype calls if you're good. Otherwise, we're going to do

01:59:05.360 --> 01:59:08.320
FUs of the week so we'll see what kind of mood we're in when we come back from

01:59:08.320 --> 01:59:14.760
this but we will do both at some point so don't get your panties in a bunch in

01:59:14.760 --> 01:59:20.920
this break in celebration of angels new necklace we're going to do a couple LED

01:59:20.920 --> 01:59:25.560
songs so we'll start it off with a little love is dreaminess and we'll be

01:59:25.560 --> 01:59:32.560
back after this with more Orange Lounge.

02:00:55.560 --> 02:01:00.560
Let's break it up with a little bit of my love and hate to fight

02:01:00.560 --> 02:01:03.560
Come on and fight baby, it's my life

02:03:03.560 --> 02:03:26.560
This is the end of the video, thank you for watching and I'll see you in the next one.

02:05:03.560 --> 02:05:32.560
Thanks for watching!

02:05:33.560 --> 02:05:39.040
Song's in the description for rainforest music.

02:06:03.560 --> 02:06:09.060
So I come into the world with dreams of old

02:06:09.060 --> 02:06:14.560
Digging into the place with new old dreams

02:06:14.560 --> 02:06:21.060
Open the door to true love

02:06:21.060 --> 02:06:32.060
Go ahead and believe in the truth

02:06:32.060 --> 02:06:38.720
Even more

02:07:32.060 --> 02:07:42.060
Gaming Radio, so uncensored, that even Tom Brokaw could get a job with us.

02:07:42.060 --> 02:07:44.060
Uh, Mooch, uh, Moochawky?

02:07:44.060 --> 02:07:46.060
Orange Lounge Radio.

02:07:46.060 --> 02:07:47.060
Tax Cunts.

02:07:47.060 --> 02:07:53.060
He cracks me up every time. See, it sounds like he says Tax Cunts, get it?

02:07:53.060 --> 02:07:56.060
It does, it totally does.

02:07:56.060 --> 02:08:01.180
he does welcome back to orange on radio boys and girls LED in that break just

02:08:01.180 --> 02:08:05.980
nothing but LED love his dreaminess nebula grasp or something wonderful

02:08:05.980 --> 02:08:12.940
photogenic all in that break and being a comedic genius in the chat room I I saw

02:08:12.940 --> 02:08:16.580
the the there's a to drink minimum suddenly in our chat room the comic

02:08:16.580 --> 02:08:21.980
stylings of dark Sakura going on in our chat room right now but in fact I don't

02:08:21.980 --> 02:08:26.100
don't know I I joined in a game here somebody just asked oh I'm not even

02:08:26.100 --> 02:08:32.020
gonna try to pronounce this name I'm totally gonna butcher this. Milfululie

02:08:32.020 --> 02:08:37.040
Milfululie I probably fucked that up says what's black and white and red all

02:08:37.040 --> 02:08:40.640
over and everybody you know is putting their own answers I put a zebra that I

02:08:40.640 --> 02:08:50.460
just shot Rini said a nun in a blender or a sunburnt penguin so everybody's a

02:08:50.460 --> 02:09:15.220
p0k3smot42o

02:09:15.220 --> 02:09:21.220
I guess I might as well acknowledge the fact that the one and only Lankystyle is sitting in the room with us right now. How you doing, Mr. Lankystyle?

02:09:21.220 --> 02:09:22.220
Why'd you do that?

02:09:22.220 --> 02:09:23.220
Why?

02:09:23.220 --> 02:09:25.220
Now this show's just taking a big turn for the worse.

02:09:25.220 --> 02:09:28.220
Oh, this show took a turn for the worse two and a half years ago.

02:09:28.220 --> 02:09:35.220
Um, what, what, um, what's I, that's when Loki joined.

02:09:35.220 --> 02:09:41.220
Um, what, what kind of games you been playing this week, my friend?

02:09:41.220 --> 02:09:42.220
Oh.

02:09:42.220 --> 02:09:45.220
Bring us back to talking about video games for a little bit.

02:10:12.220 --> 02:10:16.700
long time to be sitting with a game, seriously. Even though it's only like probably... I'm

02:10:16.700 --> 02:10:23.420
probably like not even... I'm having to scratch the surface of that game. I know I haven't.

02:10:23.420 --> 02:10:27.380
And that's fine. At least I'm getting my money's worth. But I know that I will probably completely

02:10:27.380 --> 02:10:32.820
ignore Dragon Quest this week when Animal Crossing comes out. That's true. Animal Crossing.

02:10:32.820 --> 02:10:36.820
That is looking pretty good. I mean, I haven't been doing a lot of reading on the features,

02:10:36.820 --> 02:10:41.100
but I mean... Who gives a shit? I know it has the online... Who gives a shit? It's online,

02:10:41.100 --> 02:10:45.240
it's Animal Crossing and I get a bug net. But I'm wondering if it's going to be fresh

02:10:45.240 --> 02:10:50.120
enough to keep me into it longer than I was the original.

02:10:50.120 --> 02:10:53.600
Everybody else stays on the phone. Internet, meep, meep.

02:10:53.600 --> 02:10:56.960
That's true. You know, that would be great. I think in

02:10:56.960 --> 02:11:04.520
Animal Crossing there should be a day called I kill everyone day and I go and I shoot the

02:11:04.520 --> 02:11:07.040
people I don't like in the village and then cook them for dinner.

02:11:07.040 --> 02:11:11.760
That was like the greatest Animal Crossing day ever.

02:11:11.760 --> 02:11:17.240
You get the like, come here Olivia, razor-wired bug net.

02:11:17.240 --> 02:11:20.040
You get to hit them over the head with.

02:11:20.040 --> 02:11:24.960
It's battle royale day on Animal Crossing.

02:11:24.960 --> 02:11:27.240
I told my foo-poo joke.

02:11:27.240 --> 02:11:28.880
What's this, dare I ask?

02:11:28.880 --> 02:11:30.400
Okay, I'll repeat it.

02:11:30.400 --> 02:11:33.200
How dare you interrupt my Animal Crossing rant, by the way.

02:11:33.200 --> 02:11:37.320
You will be in the Animal Battle Royale final decision.

02:11:37.320 --> 02:11:39.840
My Animal Crossing has been pre-ordered already.

02:11:39.840 --> 02:11:40.840
Alright.

02:11:40.840 --> 02:11:41.840
Alright.

02:11:41.840 --> 02:11:42.840
What's the joke?

02:11:42.840 --> 02:11:43.840
Okay.

02:11:43.840 --> 02:11:44.840
I'm going to have to retell it.

02:11:44.840 --> 02:11:48.880
These explorers, there's a legend of a bird called the Fupu Bird.

02:11:48.880 --> 02:11:50.320
I've told you this one before.

02:11:50.320 --> 02:11:51.880
I think so.

02:11:51.880 --> 02:11:55.880
Anyway, the legend is that anyone who goes after the Fupu Bird disappears.

02:11:55.880 --> 02:11:58.380
So three explorers decide they're going to find it.

02:11:58.380 --> 02:12:00.960
One goes one way and two go off the other way.

02:12:00.960 --> 02:12:07.780
And so the one who is by himself, he hears this, and then he finds he's got poo on his

02:12:07.780 --> 02:12:08.780
head.

02:12:08.780 --> 02:12:09.780
So he wipes it off.

02:12:09.780 --> 02:12:10.780
And he vanishes.

02:12:10.780 --> 02:12:16.520
So the other two are together, and all of a sudden they hear, and one of them looks

02:12:16.520 --> 02:12:18.320
up in time to get shot on in the face.

02:12:18.320 --> 02:12:19.320
So he wipes it off.

02:12:19.320 --> 02:12:20.320
That's no fun.

02:12:20.320 --> 02:12:21.320
And he disappears.

02:12:21.320 --> 02:12:26.240
And the other one is like, oh no, and he starts running off because he saw how it happened.

02:12:26.240 --> 02:12:30.520
And so right before he gets to the end of the jungle, and he's got poo on his head.

02:12:30.520 --> 02:12:33.680
He's like, well crap, I know if I wipe this off I'm going to disappear.

02:12:33.680 --> 02:12:38.080
So he goes home with shit on his head. And he goes home to his wife and she goes,

02:12:38.080 --> 02:12:41.720
why do you have crap on your head? He's like, because if you wipe off the poo-poo of the

02:12:41.720 --> 02:12:43.320
foo-poo bird, then you'll disappear.

02:12:43.320 --> 02:12:48.160
Okay, well, we'll live with it. So they go to bed. But the stink is so bad that she has to wipe it off

02:12:48.160 --> 02:12:48.800
of his head.

02:12:48.800 --> 02:12:52.560
So when she does, it disappears. So you know what the moral of the story is?

02:12:52.560 --> 02:12:59.560
What? If the two shits wear it.

02:13:03.760 --> 02:13:07.360
Please don't quit your day job. I wish I could.

02:13:07.360 --> 02:13:11.880
Oh my god, that was so bad!

02:13:11.880 --> 02:13:15.760
It was so bad! So very bad! It was bad, bad, bad!

02:13:15.760 --> 02:13:19.320
Wow, that brings me back to World 4S Forward.

02:13:19.320 --> 02:13:24.080
And that makes me want to go watch, that makes me want to go watch Deuce Bigelow European

02:13:24.080 --> 02:13:32.280
Gigolo just so I can hear something funny, maybe.

02:13:32.280 --> 02:13:35.680
Now that the show has been ruined, thank you.

02:13:35.680 --> 02:13:36.680
You laughed.

02:13:36.680 --> 02:13:39.320
Get the fooshits, Jesus Christ.

02:13:39.320 --> 02:13:44.080
Alright, um, that is definitely an opportunity for us to go into the F.U.

02:13:44.080 --> 02:13:45.080
Zooey.

02:13:45.080 --> 02:13:47.600
Hey, I told the one-eyed-whore joke too.

02:13:47.600 --> 02:13:48.600
The one-eyed-whore joke?

02:13:48.600 --> 02:13:51.600
You know what, I'm not even going to ask.

02:13:51.600 --> 02:13:58.600
I'm simply going to go to the FUs of the week, and Jamie, why is it that we do these FUs of the week every single week?

02:14:03.600 --> 02:14:06.600
YEAH DAH!

02:14:06.600 --> 02:14:18.280
The first FU of the week goes to Rob for not finding my joke hilarious, which it was and

02:14:18.280 --> 02:14:20.280
you know it.

02:14:20.280 --> 02:14:25.680
The second FU of the week goes toward certain aspects of my employment, which I am not at

02:14:25.680 --> 02:14:29.840
liberty to discuss.

02:14:29.840 --> 02:14:36.840
The other aspect goes toward me for not having the money that I want to have right now.

02:14:36.840 --> 02:14:39.840
And traffic. I hate traffic in this area.

02:14:39.840 --> 02:14:45.840
And also a humongous SU goes to superficiality.

02:14:45.840 --> 02:14:47.840
And that's it.

02:14:49.840 --> 02:14:50.840
One more.

02:14:50.840 --> 02:14:51.840
Yeah, I was going to say that was short.

02:14:51.840 --> 02:14:54.840
And having the plague. Because I feel it coming up on me again.

02:14:54.840 --> 02:14:56.840
Oh god.

02:14:56.840 --> 02:15:01.840
Alright, uh, let's go over to Loki!

02:15:01.840 --> 02:15:03.840
Okay.

02:15:03.840 --> 02:15:08.840
Anyways, um, let's start off my FUs of the week.

02:15:08.840 --> 02:15:13.840
Um, I'm actually kind of, this is not anything that has to do with me.

02:15:13.840 --> 02:15:17.840
My sister's house was actually broken into by some guy in broad daylight.

02:15:17.840 --> 02:15:21.840
Now this is how retarded this guy is, and this is kind of funny.

02:15:21.840 --> 02:15:23.840
The guy was breaking into the house in broad daylight.

02:15:23.840 --> 02:15:28.400
like. People observed him breaking into the house. First he tried the garage door and

02:15:28.400 --> 02:15:32.600
couldn't pry it open with his crowbar. Tried the front door, couldn't pry it open with

02:15:32.600 --> 02:15:37.960
his crowbar. Tried kicking in the front door, still couldn't get it. Tried the side door,

02:15:37.960 --> 02:15:46.960
couldn't get that. Finally he tried breaking the bedroom window, got in through there and

02:15:46.960 --> 02:15:56.700
stole some costume jewelry, and then left. Thereby netting absolutely nothing. So, fuck

02:15:56.700 --> 02:16:00.700
you stupid, retarded people. Not only that, he stopped traffic as he was running across

02:16:00.700 --> 02:16:06.800
the street to escape, you know, being caught even though he was already seen, but he did

02:16:06.800 --> 02:16:15.540
get away because the cops took an hour to respond. Thank you, Carmichael PD. Anyways,

02:16:15.540 --> 02:16:36.540
fucking to Microsoft for fucking up both, not only the US launch of the 360, but now the UK launch, and I know you're going to go for three with the Japanese launch, but too bad the Japanese don't give a shit about your system because all the wonderful games are coming out for it, like the wonderful RPGs and DOA4 and stuff.

02:16:36.540 --> 02:16:39.540
Oh yeah, those aren't coming out launched because they're delayed now, thank you very much.

02:16:39.540 --> 02:16:50.040
much. But hey, they can play Madden because Madden rocks, I guess. Also, fuck you to GameStop

02:16:50.040 --> 02:16:54.800
for not getting anymore shipments in of the 360. I know it's not their fault, but still

02:16:54.800 --> 02:16:58.760
though, they said I was halfway down the list. They lied to me. I was actually towards the

02:16:58.760 --> 02:17:04.680
bottom of the list, so fuck them for not knowing what halfway means. And also, fuck you to

02:17:04.680 --> 02:17:08.040
stupid people driving your cars because you can't

02:17:08.040 --> 02:17:16.040
and women do not need to be driving SUVs because they're obviously too big for them to handle

02:17:16.040 --> 02:17:17.080
wow

02:17:17.080 --> 02:17:19.400
yeah fuck them

02:17:19.400 --> 02:17:22.480
stupid useless vehicles

02:17:22.480 --> 02:17:23.800
they could uh...

02:17:23.800 --> 02:17:25.560
save that japanese uh...

02:17:25.560 --> 02:17:30.180
xbox 360 launch if they would just make a arnold swartzenegger game

02:17:30.180 --> 02:17:45.540
love Arnold Schwarzenegger in Japan. Go play my game! Do it now! Goveneta! Okay. All right,

02:17:45.540 --> 02:17:57.180
I'm done. Okay, I guess that means it's now my turn. Um, I would say an F you just to

02:17:57.180 --> 02:18:01.460
the fact that I've just been feeling like shit all week and I've just been doing some

02:18:01.460 --> 02:18:07.260
crazy things and the fact that I've just had lack of sleep and just been overall just feeling

02:18:07.260 --> 02:18:14.260
rather blah and I don't know. Eff you to the fact that I'm just an angsty person and just

02:18:17.000 --> 02:18:21.380
eff you to the fact that it's Christmas time and this time of year always sucks. It just

02:18:21.380 --> 02:18:26.140
does. I hope Santa, I better not say that because the FBI will come after me. I hope

02:18:26.140 --> 02:18:30.140
I hope Santa brings me a bomb for Christmas so I can blow some people up.

02:18:30.140 --> 02:18:32.140
But I'm not really meaning that. I don't mean that.

02:18:32.140 --> 02:18:35.140
Now you do have the turban for that.

02:18:35.140 --> 02:18:38.140
That is horrible. That is horrible.

02:18:38.140 --> 02:18:39.140
Alright.

02:18:39.140 --> 02:18:42.140
Not really. I hope it's a bomb full of confetti.

02:18:42.140 --> 02:18:44.140
So I can show you my love.

02:18:44.140 --> 02:18:49.140
Full of wonderful radioactive confetti.

02:18:49.140 --> 02:18:53.140
I'm on some list now.

02:18:53.140 --> 02:18:58.140
I can always do what the major retailers are doing, that's just crash a float into somebody.

02:18:58.140 --> 02:19:00.140
Yeah, that sounds like fun.

02:19:00.140 --> 02:19:07.140
I want somebody to build me a spongebob bomb of air. Hot air. That'd be fun.

02:19:07.140 --> 02:19:10.140
I think there's already enough hot air in the government.

02:19:10.140 --> 02:19:16.140
Alright, let's go to Brad. I'm sure Brad has some FUs that he wants to get out of his system.

02:19:16.140 --> 02:19:20.140
Sure, why not? What do you call a deer with no eyes? No-eye deer.

02:19:20.140 --> 02:19:24.140
What do you call a deer with no eyes and no legs? Still no idea.

02:19:24.140 --> 02:19:27.140
There's my refuse of the week.

02:19:27.140 --> 02:19:31.140
Well, if we were going with corny jokes for the night, then I figured it out.

02:19:31.140 --> 02:19:33.140
You are fucking lame.

02:19:33.140 --> 02:19:37.140
Uh, Angel, don't run away. What's your refuse of the week?

02:19:37.140 --> 02:19:40.140
Um, yeah.

02:19:40.140 --> 02:19:46.140
A few people that didn't say happy birthday, but you guys did, so you guys love me. Yay!

02:19:46.140 --> 02:19:48.140
Yay!

02:19:48.140 --> 02:19:50.140
namagem1 I don't know, what else?

02:19:50.140 --> 02:19:52.140
namagem1 Oh yeah, it's been hella cold, what the hell?

02:19:52.140 --> 02:19:54.140
namagem1 I can't really say that though

02:19:54.140 --> 02:20:00.140
namagem1 because people in other areas of the United States are colder, so whatever

02:20:00.140 --> 02:20:04.140
namagem1 But I've been cold, so you know what, yeah, whatever

02:20:04.140 --> 02:20:07.140
namagem1 Uh, who didn't go? Anyone?

02:20:07.140 --> 02:20:11.140
namagem1 Okay, I'm just talking to myself. Bye

02:20:11.140 --> 02:20:15.140
namagem1 Okay, um, Rise Princess, do you have anything you want to get out of your system?

02:20:45.140 --> 02:20:59.820
F.U. to early morning shifts during the holidays and an F.U. to people I work with for they

02:20:59.820 --> 02:21:07.400
are SO STUPID and they supposed to be salesmen for the love of mike

02:21:07.400 --> 02:21:12.180
sakurina says F.U. to konami of hawaii you whores for removing the fuck from guideca

02:21:12.180 --> 02:21:16.140
How dare you? It sounds like shit now that you shitheads get the fuck out of my life.

02:21:16.140 --> 02:21:18.820
F you to lame puns since that's all I do.

02:21:18.820 --> 02:21:23.180
And yeah, F you to my mom for switching from OSX to Windows. What the fuck is wrong with you?

02:21:23.180 --> 02:21:28.500
And F you to Loki for saying women can't drive SUVs.

02:21:28.500 --> 02:21:30.380
Truth hurts, right?

02:21:30.380 --> 02:21:31.700
Blow walk.

02:21:31.700 --> 02:21:36.620
Not as much as a woman hitting you with her SUV.

02:21:36.620 --> 02:21:43.180
sent me something over private messages that was not a nephew.

02:21:43.180 --> 02:21:47.180
Tomokun says your website says that Mario Mix is discontinued, but according to this

02:21:47.180 --> 02:21:51.280
article from Joystiq, the game was not discontinued, it is just selling out.

02:21:51.280 --> 02:21:55.240
If you read the article that I posted on the site, you would see that I said the exact

02:21:55.240 --> 02:21:56.240
same thing.

02:21:56.240 --> 02:21:59.480
But they are saying that it's coming back in March.

02:21:59.480 --> 02:22:02.760
Yes, well that means it's discontinued until March.

02:22:02.760 --> 02:22:03.760
Duh.

02:22:03.760 --> 02:22:10.260
crochet. Tomoku would also like to say, fuck Xbox 360. Well said. NintendoManiac64 says,

02:22:10.260 --> 02:22:14.880
F you to my DS's L button. I can't play some of my GBA games on my DS efficiently now.

02:22:14.880 --> 02:22:19.880
F you to Mario Kart DS disconnectors that disconnect at the end of races. F you to my

02:22:19.880 --> 02:22:24.480
parents that don't really trust ordering things online at all. Now how else am I supposed

02:22:24.480 --> 02:22:28.760
to use this Playstation DDR pad when I don't even have a PS2? Besides, StepMania isn't

02:22:58.760 --> 02:23:05.560
game to play 2DX. Dark Tetsuya says, one last F.U. to AOL. Can't say I'll miss any of the

02:23:05.560 --> 02:23:09.520
following. The random disconnects, the out of memory errors, and the constant lockups.

02:23:09.520 --> 02:23:18.520
Uh, yes? I have actually one more. Okay. An F.U. to Xbox 360 for freezing. You know they

02:23:18.560 --> 02:23:23.000
say only 3% of Xbox 360s are supposed to be doing that. You're lucky. You're a liar. You're

02:23:23.000 --> 02:23:28.080
a winner motion is that who says f you to getting up this morning to go to the

02:23:42.280 --> 02:23:46.680
illusion says f you to the holiday season bah humbug the only good thing

02:23:46.680 --> 02:23:50.400

F you to jolly tidings, pow right in the kisser.

02:23:55.420 --> 02:24:00.260
Roz says F you to my city for installing some newfangled traffic thing right before Christmas

02:24:00.260 --> 02:24:02.100
at the mall entrance.

02:24:02.100 --> 02:24:06.180
People are like lalala pulling in, oh shit there's only one lane now.

02:24:06.180 --> 02:24:11.740
Also F you to the Java IRC chat because it made me late getting to the chat.

02:24:11.740 --> 02:24:17.420
Neodude says F you to Nintendo Wi-Fi connection because I can't connect to a WPA protected

02:24:17.420 --> 02:24:18.900
network with a DS.

02:24:18.900 --> 02:24:22.380
I have to buy the USB connector for $35.

02:24:22.380 --> 02:24:25.060
Big Power says, F you to the yearly December break

02:24:25.060 --> 02:24:26.500
that many TV shows go on with.

02:24:26.500 --> 02:24:28.660
They have a long break with no new episodes.

02:24:28.660 --> 02:24:30.460
I want my Lost and Prison break.

02:24:30.460 --> 02:24:33.740
Oh, and Watch 24 when it comes back on.

02:24:33.740 --> 02:24:38.620
Goggle says, F the whole college application process.

02:24:38.620 --> 02:24:39.500
And F back payment.

02:24:42.540 --> 02:24:46.420
GS191 says, F you to my workplace for playing that

02:24:46.420 --> 02:24:50.820
damn rent song over and over and over again last week. At least they were playing Daft

02:24:50.820 --> 02:24:55.980
Punk's Technologic. Now we're playing sucky Christmas music now with crappy pop remixes.

02:24:55.980 --> 02:25:01.180
A late F you to Black Friday and stupid customers ask me where are the iPods, GPS, random shit

02:25:01.180 --> 02:25:04.980
when I'm in the fucking printer isle. Do you see any fucking iPods here? Look at the fucking

02:25:04.980 --> 02:25:11.980
map we gave you. Zander C says F you to Jamie's lame jokes. You need to try to slap him. You

02:25:41.980 --> 02:25:46.380
And lastly, Spiritsnare would like to say an F you to Xbox 360.

02:25:46.380 --> 02:25:50.380
F you to RENT because it has some of the most addicting songs I've ever heard on their soundtrack.

02:25:50.380 --> 02:25:55.780
F you to the Final Fantasy Potions because they probably will never make it over here, except at anime conventions.

02:25:56.780 --> 02:25:58.180
Also an F you to N-

02:26:00.580 --> 02:26:04.980
At $30 and not $20, even though they're not decent ports.

02:26:07.380 --> 02:26:10.180
Damn, you bitches are angsty tonight, that's all I have to say.

02:26:10.180 --> 02:26:16.060
wow wow wow wow the chat room is turned into bra chat oh really and what kind of

02:26:16.060 --> 02:26:19.980
things have we learned about bras apparently underwear keeps you from

02:26:19.980 --> 02:26:24.100
being droopy like grandma when you're old I you know I I'm glad that my

02:26:24.100 --> 02:26:27.580
underwear does not have metal wires in it because that might be painful worst

02:26:27.580 --> 02:26:32.540
invention ever you know and I bet I do recall from you know I used I used to

02:26:32.540 --> 02:26:36.060
hate girls and sometimes we'd get you know we get shut up why is everybody

02:26:36.060 --> 02:26:43.180
You know, we used to get a little freaky, and I used to go shopping with a girl and

02:26:43.180 --> 02:26:45.380
your girlfriends doesn't mean you're dating them.

02:26:45.380 --> 02:26:46.380
No, no, no.

02:26:46.380 --> 02:26:50.500
I actually, I used to take girls' bras off, and I remember it was a pain in the ass to

02:26:50.500 --> 02:26:51.500
do.

02:26:51.500 --> 02:26:52.500
Like, it's...

02:26:52.500 --> 02:26:53.500
You need to...

02:26:53.500 --> 02:26:54.500
That was the sign right there.

02:26:54.500 --> 02:26:55.500
Seriously!

02:26:55.500 --> 02:26:56.500
That's how I knew I was gay.

02:26:56.500 --> 02:26:59.580
I was like, fuck this bra shit, I'm just gonna suck dick.

02:26:59.580 --> 02:27:01.660
That's easy.

02:27:01.660 --> 02:27:03.660
It's not that hard.

02:27:03.660 --> 02:27:04.660
That's easy.

02:27:04.660 --> 02:27:05.660
It's not that hard.

02:27:05.660 --> 02:27:12.560
way she figured out. It's not that hard when she figured out. Seriously. I know. I just,

02:27:12.560 --> 02:27:16.560
you know. You get to the point where you can just look at a broad and it pops off. Look,

02:27:16.560 --> 02:27:21.560
I give up easy. I give up easy, okay? I'm a quitter. I just, I take the lazy way out.

02:27:21.560 --> 02:27:30.160
Alright. What? What's so damn funny? Rob is more interested in putting him on than taking

02:27:30.160 --> 02:27:36.560
him off. No way. Take that both ways if you want. No, that is the gay stereotype I do

02:27:36.560 --> 02:27:44.680
not do, okay? Every gay...no, no, no. Every gay person I know fits into some gay stereotype.

02:27:44.680 --> 02:27:48.900
There's some gay stereotype. Wait, wait, wait, wait. Even Shane. What? What was that one

02:27:48.900 --> 02:27:54.080
time at the other apartment when I came back from the pool and there was people wearing

02:27:54.080 --> 02:27:59.120
bras with, like, water balloon or condom, like, breasts? Not me. Not me. That was my

02:27:59.120 --> 02:28:03.860
surprise birthday party there was a dress involved that I didn't I didn't

02:28:03.860 --> 02:28:08.300
wear a bra it was a bitch and ho party and it was that was the whole theme it

02:28:08.300 --> 02:28:13.420
was I I'm just hoping you wasn't getting like hot and bothered off of it that's

02:28:13.420 --> 02:28:18.500
all no you weren't wearing a bra no I wasn't no no I was the pimp of the party

02:28:18.500 --> 02:28:24.460
everybody else was a bitch and ho I see what I can't understand how you can like

02:28:24.460 --> 02:28:31.460
teach, you know, PPOs and HMOs and all that complicated crap, but you can't unhook three

02:28:31.520 --> 02:28:36.520
little hooks from a bra. No, like seriously? The girls I used to date would have like the

02:28:36.520 --> 02:28:41.240
20-hook bras. It was horrible. It was like... The 20-hook bras. Yes. But were they grandmas

02:28:41.240 --> 02:28:46.560
or something? I guess. You liked older women? I don't know. Mating gorillas? No! I was dating

02:28:46.560 --> 02:28:49.420
very nice women that had bras with 20-hooks on them. I don't know, in some respects, that

02:28:49.420 --> 02:28:54.440
might not be a bad thing since that involves, you know, Damon Alberd. Oh, stop it. So,

02:28:54.440 --> 02:28:57.640
20 hooks, so what are they, monkey people or something?

02:28:57.640 --> 02:29:00.240
No, they just, it was a complicated bra.

02:29:00.240 --> 02:29:05.240
I would like you to make my, my wonderful friend...

02:29:05.240 --> 02:29:14.240
They need to make bra, you know what, why don't they make, here's a novel concept.

02:29:14.240 --> 02:29:17.440
Why don't they make what? No, no, let me finish.

02:29:17.440 --> 02:29:21.640
Why don't they make a bra out of Velcro? Wouldn't that be easy?

02:29:21.640 --> 02:29:23.640
Just rip, and there we go!

02:29:23.640 --> 02:29:25.640
Because Velcro doesn't hold for shit?

02:29:25.640 --> 02:29:27.640
No, didn't...

02:29:27.640 --> 02:29:32.640
You know what? I know some girls on the itty bitty titty committee who they would work just fine for.

02:29:32.640 --> 02:29:35.640
But that's the whole point, like...

02:29:35.640 --> 02:29:45.640
Sorry, the fact that you wouldn't mind pulling a bra off of an itty bitty titty committee applicant shows that you're gay, but whatever.

02:29:45.640 --> 02:29:54.040
I completely forgot what I was going to say. Oh, I know. Well, you shouldn't have dated

02:29:54.040 --> 02:29:59.720
girls who were girdles. They weren't girdles. They were just, they were bras. If there's

02:29:59.720 --> 02:30:05.760
20 hooks, it'd have to be a girdle. I don't know. Maybe, maybe in my mind, maybe they

02:30:05.760 --> 02:30:10.360
weren't really 20 hooks, but in my mind, like, I've gone back, yeah, I'm like having nightmares

02:30:10.360 --> 02:30:14.360
of the bras and like they're like like I remember looking at the back and it's

02:30:14.360 --> 02:30:27.160
like don't you dare touch me what Rob has bra phobia I do he has those dreams

02:30:27.160 --> 02:30:31.560
where it's really abstract he looks at it and it just like it the hooks go down

02:30:31.560 --> 02:30:37.160
towards the horizon they're just never-ending just bra strap that's like

02:30:37.160 --> 02:30:42.160
my hell. It's like, here, do you want to get into the gates of heaven? Just unhook the

02:30:42.160 --> 02:30:48.120
door that's very similar to a bra. Oh, it's going to be my hell, where I have to spend

02:30:48.120 --> 02:30:51.280
my eternity trying to figure out how to open up the goddamn door to heaven because they

02:30:51.280 --> 02:30:56.840
have it like a bra. First they make you straight, so that you want to get through the bra anyway,

02:30:56.840 --> 02:31:02.520
and then, yeah, and you can't. There you go. And then you have sex with women, and oh man,

02:31:02.520 --> 02:31:05.760
that's crazy hell. Yeah, he's going to have sex, then he's about to have sex with a woman

02:31:05.760 --> 02:31:13.280
becomes gay. And, again. Yeah, anyway, I don't like all this talk about me and my

02:31:13.280 --> 02:31:17.440
bra thing. I'm just writing my movie, that's all. Your movie? What's your movie?

02:31:17.440 --> 02:31:21.400
Do you want to plug your movie? The Life of Rob. That's what people do on

02:31:21.400 --> 02:31:24.920
shows, is they plug things. So you have a movie coming out you want to put on? No, you don't?

02:31:24.920 --> 02:31:29.280
Not yet. Okay. Are you writing one? Maybe someday. Do you want to pitch one? No. We have important

02:31:29.280 --> 02:31:31.900
people listen to this program

02:31:31.900 --> 02:31:33.740
mother

02:31:33.740 --> 02:31:35.080
uh...

02:31:35.080 --> 02:31:36.360
uh...

02:31:36.360 --> 02:31:37.420
sorry

02:31:37.420 --> 02:31:40.980
there was something that listeners couldn't be but whatever that radio

02:31:40.980 --> 02:31:42.600
was funny

02:31:42.600 --> 02:31:45.080
the times

02:31:45.080 --> 02:31:47.920
and of course now our chat room just suddenly

02:31:47.920 --> 02:31:52.080
fills up with all this chap rob rob rob rob rob rob rob rob rob rob rob rob

02:31:52.080 --> 02:31:53.560
but rob rob rob rob rob rob rob

02:31:53.560 --> 02:31:58.660
but we were talking about bras before we got on the verbal topic i don't

02:31:58.660 --> 02:32:02.620
Okay, anyways. What? Oh, yes. Low-key. Something related to video gaming.

02:32:02.620 --> 02:32:05.300
No, I didn't have anything. I was just gonna... I was just gonna say...

02:32:05.300 --> 02:32:08.620
Very rare bear.

02:32:08.620 --> 02:32:12.140
Love the inside joke. I need a break.

02:32:12.140 --> 02:32:16.060
At least it's not cake pie. We're gonna do a break, and then we're gonna come back...

02:32:16.060 --> 02:32:18.980
We're gonna come back, and we're gonna do some Skype.

02:32:18.980 --> 02:32:22.060
Skype atcha, comin' atcha.

02:32:22.060 --> 02:32:23.060
And then, um,

02:32:23.060 --> 02:32:26.620
Ask Orange Lounge, because we know you want to ask us some questions, and

02:32:26.620 --> 02:32:27.540
therefore,

02:32:27.540 --> 02:32:29.540
We want to give you some answers.

02:32:29.540 --> 02:32:31.540
Does that sound like a plan?

02:32:31.540 --> 02:32:33.540
Sounds like a plan. I hope so.

02:32:33.540 --> 02:32:35.540
We'll be back after this. We're going to start off

02:32:35.540 --> 02:32:37.540
this break with the

02:32:37.540 --> 02:32:39.540
the new Naoki song.

02:32:39.540 --> 02:32:41.540
Brilliant R.E.D.

02:32:41.540 --> 02:32:43.540
as opposed to Brilliant

02:32:43.540 --> 02:32:45.540
Purple or something else.

02:32:45.540 --> 02:32:52.540
or brilliant, brilliant B.R.A.

02:33:15.540 --> 02:33:24.540
I knew the first time I saw you out on the floor

02:33:24.540 --> 02:33:27.540
Yes, that you were so much more

02:33:27.540 --> 02:33:31.540
It's just the way that you move your body with mine

02:33:31.540 --> 02:33:34.540
Feels like we had no concept of time

02:33:34.540 --> 02:33:38.540
It's just the way that you do, that's what we do

02:33:38.540 --> 02:33:44.540
I wanna show you how much we can lose

02:33:44.540 --> 02:33:47.740
This is the night made for just you and I

02:33:47.840 --> 02:33:50.820
This is the night, won't you take me inside

02:33:50.820 --> 02:33:53.900
This is the night, now look into my eye

02:33:53.900 --> 02:33:57.340
I want you, I need you, to make it alright

02:33:57.340 --> 02:34:00.280
This is the night like the last of our lives

02:34:00.300 --> 02:34:03.580
This is the night when you Jersey

02:34:03.580 --> 02:34:06.620
This is the night made for just you and I

02:34:06.620 --> 02:34:09.900
I want you, I need you to hold on tight

02:34:39.900 --> 02:34:42.900
Why?

02:34:42.900 --> 02:34:45.900
Leave me alone, so tell me why

02:34:45.900 --> 02:34:49.900
Everyone needs to carry on

02:34:49.900 --> 02:34:54.900
Leave me alone if I'm not right

02:34:54.900 --> 02:34:56.900
And why?

02:34:56.900 --> 02:34:59.900
Leave me alone so many days

02:34:59.900 --> 02:35:03.900
You're thinking of you so many times

02:35:03.900 --> 02:35:08.900
Leave me alone if I'm not right

02:35:08.900 --> 02:35:10.900
Don't tell me why

02:35:15.900 --> 02:35:17.900
Don't tell me why

02:36:47.900 --> 02:36:49.900
Hooray!

02:36:49.900 --> 02:36:51.900
Hooray!

02:36:59.900 --> 02:37:01.900
Hooray!

02:38:01.900 --> 02:38:12.900
Death inside, candlelight, my despair in gloom I'm just no pretty scene, I'm considered a truth

02:38:12.900 --> 02:38:19.900
So far, it's dark, can't you feel my pain? People are all the same, they actually make my way

02:38:19.900 --> 02:38:26.900
Cast a ghost right to the center of my heart

02:38:26.900 --> 02:38:32.900
I am frozen from the sky

02:38:35.900 --> 02:38:38.900
I am garbage, I am jail

02:38:38.900 --> 02:38:42.900
I am scary, I am sane

02:38:42.900 --> 02:38:45.900
I'm a loner, I am cold

02:38:45.900 --> 02:38:49.900
I feel safe to when people don't know

02:38:49.900 --> 02:38:52.900
I am nothing, I am dead

02:38:52.900 --> 02:38:56.900
I am scary, I am insane

02:38:56.900 --> 02:38:59.900
I am loner, I am cold

02:38:59.900 --> 02:39:05.900
No, I didn't think that we were gonna fall

02:39:29.900 --> 02:39:38.020
Oh, there I am. Next time, remember to unmute the mics.

02:39:38.020 --> 02:39:40.540
Skype line is open, boys and girls. If you want to give us a call, we're going to give

02:39:40.540 --> 02:39:44.420
you a few minutes to get in on Skype. Also, we're going to be doing some Ask Orange Lounge.

02:39:44.420 --> 02:39:47.260
So if you're not so much feeling the Skype thing, you want to ask us some questions,

02:39:47.260 --> 02:39:51.340
we are taking submissions in chat right now for Ask Orange Lounge. We don't have a lot

02:39:51.340 --> 02:39:57.020
of time for Ask Orange Lounge, but we want to at least get a couple questions answered

02:39:57.020 --> 02:40:00.800
because, you know, with it being the holiday season, perhaps there's some things you want

02:40:00.800 --> 02:40:05.420
to know about Christmas. Now, Jamie is showing off all these cool toys she has, which makes

02:40:05.420 --> 02:40:09.420
me insanely jealous. Can I play with this one? What is this? Tell the listeners what

02:40:09.420 --> 02:40:14.340
I'm playing with. Um, someone left it in Dan's store, so he gave it to me. It's an R2D2 that

02:40:14.340 --> 02:40:19.660
shows the picture of Princess Leia. That is so cool. Like, when I push it, like, I show

02:40:19.660 --> 02:40:24.940
it on the wall. It's Princess Leia, with a bun. That is so badass. And then I have lots

02:40:24.940 --> 02:40:29.340
of drugs. I don't want one. And I have, like, the most awesome keychain, uh, uh, cell phone

02:40:29.340 --> 02:40:34.220
strap. What is that now, on the cell phone strap? I have prints. From Katamari Damashi.

02:40:34.220 --> 02:40:38.060
No, no, no, no, no, no. Now you just need the ringtones, and then you'd be a total addict

02:40:38.060 --> 02:40:42.220
there. Oh, I can get those, or midis. Alright. Let's go to a call, huh? You're on Orange

02:40:42.220 --> 02:40:47.260
Lounge Radio, who dis? It's the one and only Ron Chan, what's up fellas? Hello Ron Chan,

02:40:47.260 --> 02:40:51.140
how are you? I'm doing good, I'm doing good. I ju- I just wanna point out, though, Dark

02:40:51.140 --> 02:40:54.580
Dark Sakura is not a fella.

02:40:54.580 --> 02:40:55.580
I know, I know.

02:40:55.580 --> 02:40:57.180
I have that effect on women.

02:40:57.180 --> 02:40:58.180
I'm sorry.

02:40:58.180 --> 02:41:00.060
That's alright.

02:41:00.060 --> 02:41:02.180
I've seen you hanging with the ladies, Ronja.

02:41:02.180 --> 02:41:03.180
Not really.

02:41:03.180 --> 02:41:04.180
Just a couple.

02:41:04.180 --> 02:41:05.180
But, no.

02:41:05.180 --> 02:41:06.180
I don't know where I'm going with that.

02:41:06.180 --> 02:41:07.180
Anyway.

02:41:07.180 --> 02:41:11.340
I don't think it would be possible to mistake me for a dude since I have humongous boobs.

02:41:11.340 --> 02:41:13.380
Does your bra have twenty hooks on it?

02:41:13.380 --> 02:41:14.380
No, Rob.

02:41:14.380 --> 02:41:15.380
Just three.

02:41:15.380 --> 02:41:16.380
Okay.

02:41:16.380 --> 02:41:17.380
What about Velcro?

02:41:17.380 --> 02:41:18.380
What do you think?

02:41:18.380 --> 02:41:19.380
Never mind.

02:41:19.380 --> 02:41:20.380
Forget it.

02:41:20.380 --> 02:41:22.380
What's on your mind?

02:41:22.380 --> 02:41:26.380
Uh, not much. I'm still addicted to Mario Kart DS.

02:41:26.380 --> 02:41:33.380
It is a fun game. Do you actually find friends online to play against? Because I never do, unless I set it up on Instant Messenger.

02:41:33.380 --> 02:41:40.380
That's the only way. If I'm in a chat room with a bunch of us, that's how we do it. And even half the time, we can't even race each other.

02:41:40.380 --> 02:41:45.380
Wow. Oh, because you don't find each other on the game or something, or what?

02:41:45.380 --> 02:41:54.380
We don't find each other. There's like, one time there was like five of us, we were going to try to get at least four of us in a race, it turned out to be me and two people. Or me and one person.

02:41:54.380 --> 02:42:01.380
That's weird. So it didn't, it can't find your friends or something? Maybe the lag was too great or something.

02:42:01.380 --> 02:42:06.380
What lag? I mean, I do this at work and the router's like six feet behind me.

02:42:06.380 --> 02:42:09.380
I don't know what to tell you, buddy. I'm sorry.

02:42:09.380 --> 02:42:15.260
I'm not too worried about it, but I can say this with my DS. I found I found plenty of

02:42:15.820 --> 02:42:17.820
Wireless networks around my neighborhood

02:42:18.540 --> 02:42:24.460
Yeah, I found one up. I was at um the rice princess and lanky styles apartment not that long ago, and I tapped into a

02:42:25.260 --> 02:42:31.380
Wireless network near them and that made me feel like elite hacker. It was cool. I was stealing bandwidth. I could go to jail

02:42:33.100 --> 02:42:36.900
Hey, I call it sharing the wealth are you gonna be getting animal crossing?

02:42:36.900 --> 02:42:39.660
Maybe in a couple of weeks.

02:42:39.660 --> 02:42:40.660
Alright.

02:42:40.660 --> 02:42:46.420
Well, when you get it, you, me, bike racks, three o'clock, bring your bug net, it's on.

02:42:46.420 --> 02:42:47.420
Bring it.

02:42:47.420 --> 02:42:48.420
Bring it.

02:42:48.420 --> 02:42:49.420
It's already been brought in, my friend.

02:42:49.420 --> 02:42:50.420
Alright.

02:42:50.420 --> 02:42:51.420
Oh, yeah.

02:42:51.420 --> 02:42:54.500
One thing from last week, you were talking about Casticon.

02:42:54.500 --> 02:42:55.500
Yes.

02:42:55.500 --> 02:42:59.420
I went to Casticon and we got snowed in for two days.

02:42:59.420 --> 02:43:04.100
If I get snowed in at this crazy convention in D.C., which I will be going to, it sounds

02:43:04.100 --> 02:43:08.260
I have the time approved off work. All I have to do is get a plane ticket, which are very affordable right now

02:43:08.420 --> 02:43:13.940
So I'm gonna be booking that sometime this week. I just need to discuss travel arrangements with you my friend

02:43:14.940 --> 02:43:21.580
Sure, no problem. If I get snowed in I'm gonna cry. I am from California. I've lived in California my entire life. I don't do snow

02:43:22.240 --> 02:43:29.460
Do you know this? I have never this might this is gonna be a crazy concept some of you people I have never seen snow

02:43:29.460 --> 02:43:36.300
falling from the sky in person. Never. I haven't. That was in Alabama. Never. I've never seen

02:43:36.300 --> 02:43:41.220
snow falling from the sky. That was like way down south in Alabama. That was in Mobile.

02:43:41.220 --> 02:43:44.460
I've seen snow once it's already on the ground. It's not that hard to drive up to Reno and

02:43:44.460 --> 02:43:49.780
see some snow here where we live. But I've never seen snow fall from the sky. Every time

02:43:49.780 --> 02:43:53.180
it's happened in Sacramento, like the two times it's ever happened since I've been alive,

02:43:53.180 --> 02:43:58.820
I was either asleep or the one other time it ever happened I was doing an internet radio

02:43:58.820 --> 02:44:01.940
show, believe it or not, at the old college station. Crazy, huh?

02:44:01.940 --> 02:44:07.220
We're gonna have to get a wee hair last night. Alright, well, it better not snow, cause I

02:44:07.220 --> 02:44:09.460
don't know what to do. I will cry like a little girl.

02:44:09.460 --> 02:44:14.940
No, what'll happen is they'll shut down the airport and get out a day later.

02:44:14.940 --> 02:44:19.940
Oh my god, I will poop myself if that happens. I don't know how to deal with that. I don't

02:44:19.940 --> 02:44:22.500
do flight delays. Alright.

02:44:22.500 --> 02:44:26.060
That happened to a bunch of West Coast that came at Castle Con 9 two years ago.

02:44:26.060 --> 02:44:28.060
Stop scaring me!

02:44:29.060 --> 02:44:30.060
Alright, we gotta go. We gotta take more calls.

02:44:30.060 --> 02:44:32.060
You beat it, bro! Not that bad.

02:44:32.060 --> 02:44:36.060
We gotta take more calls. And you're, you're freaking me out. I'm gonna have nightmares tonight about snow.

02:44:36.060 --> 02:44:38.060
Alright. Take care, my friend.

02:44:39.060 --> 02:44:40.060
There, bye.

02:44:40.060 --> 02:44:41.060
Bye.

02:44:42.060 --> 02:44:44.060
Alright, and everybody in the chatroom going,

02:44:44.060 --> 02:44:49.060
Sky, you big baby! Sky, you're a baby! You need to stop being such a baby about snow!

02:44:49.060 --> 02:44:54.060
Come to Colorado! Come to New York! Come here! Watch the snow!

02:44:54.060 --> 02:44:55.060
No thank you, I live in California for real.

02:44:55.060 --> 02:44:57.060
I have to just go to Reno.

02:44:57.060 --> 02:44:58.060
I know.

02:44:58.060 --> 02:44:59.060
All right.

02:44:59.060 --> 02:45:01.900
Yeah, we're about ready to go to lightning round pretty soon here, but no, we'll get

02:45:01.900 --> 02:45:02.900
one at least.

02:45:02.900 --> 02:45:06.340
Oh, I was just about to pick up that call and dude hung up.

02:45:06.340 --> 02:45:08.540
I was just about to click the little thing.

02:45:08.540 --> 02:45:10.500
Oh, there he is.

02:45:10.500 --> 02:45:11.500
He's back now.

02:45:11.500 --> 02:45:14.060
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

02:45:14.060 --> 02:45:17.060
Hello, you are on Orange Lounge Radio.

02:45:17.060 --> 02:45:18.060
Hello.

02:45:18.060 --> 02:45:19.060
Hello.

02:45:19.060 --> 02:45:22.660
Bienvenidos, Orange Lounge Radio.

02:45:22.660 --> 02:45:24.660
What's on your mind?

02:45:24.660 --> 02:45:26.660
What is on your mind, my friend?

02:45:26.660 --> 02:45:28.660
Um...

02:45:28.660 --> 02:45:30.660
Dang.

02:45:30.660 --> 02:45:32.660
First off, who the hell is this?

02:45:32.660 --> 02:45:34.660
Who is this?

02:45:34.660 --> 02:45:36.660
Santa from Florida.

02:45:36.660 --> 02:45:38.660
Oh, hi Santa from Florida. What's on your mind?

02:45:38.660 --> 02:45:40.660
Um...

02:45:40.660 --> 02:45:42.660
I don't know if this is what I should do, but I wanted to bring up the

02:45:42.660 --> 02:45:44.660
Nintendo Revolution not supporting

02:45:44.660 --> 02:45:46.660
HDTV thingy real quick.

02:45:46.660 --> 02:45:48.660
Uh, sure. What's up?

02:45:48.660 --> 02:45:50.660
Well...

02:45:50.660 --> 02:45:52.660
Um...

02:45:52.660 --> 02:45:58.380
reason they're doing it is well for one reason because they're using standard

02:45:58.380 --> 02:46:04.420
DVDs I think it's not really smart to be doing HD because I mean you're seeing

02:46:04.420 --> 02:46:10.380
with the Xbox 360 with them oblivion or yeah oblivion it's like gonna take up

02:46:10.380 --> 02:46:15.300
four discs or something like that that's one thing another thing is the cost I

02:46:15.300 --> 02:46:19.340
mean it's just gonna be ridiculous cost to small developers to try to put HD in

02:46:19.340 --> 02:46:29.340
I somewhat agree with you. I also think the reason why they're not doing it is because Loki has me convinced that the revolution is the fact that there is going to be stereoscopic 3D.

02:46:29.340 --> 02:46:32.340
And they just don't want to do that for HDTV. That would cost too much.

02:46:32.340 --> 02:46:39.340
I heard you say that too. I don't know if they're going to do that. I think they cost too much.

02:46:39.340 --> 02:46:40.340
I don't know.

02:46:40.340 --> 02:46:43.340
I don't think it would fit in their $200 price range thingy.

02:46:43.340 --> 02:46:48.700
If they have a good development kit, all you need is some 3D World Runner all over again,

02:46:48.700 --> 02:46:49.700
Rad Racer.

02:46:49.700 --> 02:46:55.660
Can somebody explain to me what the fuck the point was of 3D and Rad Racer?

02:46:55.660 --> 02:46:57.260
It did like nothing for that game.

02:46:57.260 --> 02:46:59.620
3D and Rad Racer did nothing.

02:46:59.620 --> 02:47:00.620
It was so rad.

02:47:00.620 --> 02:47:03.540
It was... shut up.

02:47:03.540 --> 02:47:04.540
You know what?

02:47:04.540 --> 02:47:05.540
You bring up some good points.

02:47:05.540 --> 02:47:09.660
And I, owning an HDTV, it makes me sad that Nintendo is not supporting it.

02:47:09.660 --> 02:47:14.960
Remember, if they're doing it for cost reasons, and if they're doing it for these other reasons

02:47:14.960 --> 02:47:19.400
that they plan to do more crazy shit with their system, I'm okay with it.

02:47:19.400 --> 02:47:23.720
But remember the golden rule, a system is only as good as games.

02:47:23.720 --> 02:47:25.040
Wow, we've got the whole event saying that now.

02:47:25.040 --> 02:47:28.960
Well, here's the other thing also, is, you know, just because they say they're not supporting

02:47:28.960 --> 02:47:34.080
HD does not mean that the, it just means they're not supporting the formats of HD, you know,

02:47:34.080 --> 02:47:35.860
the aspect ratios and stuff.

02:47:35.860 --> 02:47:38.240
So it could be something completely different also.

02:47:38.240 --> 02:47:42.220
Maybe they'll still support progressive scan and widescreen. That would be okay. Maybe

02:47:42.220 --> 02:47:47.360
they'll support 480, what would that be, 480p. That's okay. There's some pretty good looking

02:47:47.360 --> 02:47:51.720
games at 480p. If it, maybe you're right. Maybe the fact that they're not doing HDTV

02:47:51.720 --> 02:47:56.460
means they're not going to support 1080p or something. That's okay. As long as my games

02:47:56.460 --> 02:48:00.920
can have some widescreen in it and some progressive, dammit, some progressive scan, some widescreen,

02:48:00.920 --> 02:48:03.800
that would be kind of cool. But I'm not going to hold my breath with Nintendo here.

02:48:03.800 --> 02:48:04.800
there.

02:48:04.800 --> 02:48:05.800
Yeah.

02:48:05.800 --> 02:48:10.280
Well, they're supposed to announce more, um, did you hear the, uh, that they have another

02:48:10.280 --> 02:48:11.680
big secret, apparently?

02:48:11.680 --> 02:48:12.680
Well, yeah.

02:48:12.680 --> 02:48:15.120
Yeah, that it's stereoscopic 3D.

02:48:15.120 --> 02:48:20.280
No, they're saying, they're saying, uh, there's, Miyamoto did another speech.

02:48:20.280 --> 02:48:24.520
Oh, yeah, yeah, I heard, I read some more than Miyamoto did another speech.

02:48:24.520 --> 02:48:28.680
Yeah, just to add to your argument, somebody posted this on LJ and I saw this, Miyamoto

02:48:28.680 --> 02:48:32.940
did another speech and said there's a, there's another secret coming that you kids don't

02:48:32.940 --> 02:48:36.880
know about, so just you wait for it. Everyone thinks it's about the controller because he

02:48:36.880 --> 02:48:40.660
was talking about the controller at the time, but I don't think it is. I think it's still

02:48:40.660 --> 02:48:46.040
the stereoscopic 3D thing. What did he say about the controller? What else could they

02:48:46.040 --> 02:48:51.040
say about the controller? That you're going to use it in the stereoscopic 3D games. Well,

02:48:51.040 --> 02:48:57.880
no. Maybe you're onto something. We'll see. I don't know. And maybe we're fucking idiots.

02:48:57.880 --> 02:49:02.880
I don't know. We'll see soon enough. But it's fun to imagine, isn't it?

02:49:02.880 --> 02:49:03.880
Go away for a drink.

02:49:03.880 --> 02:49:07.880
Yeah, we will. We'll be first in line. Hopefully they won't kick us out.

02:49:07.880 --> 02:49:11.880
All right. We're going to let you go, buddy. We got to get to the next segment, all right?

02:49:11.880 --> 02:49:14.880
But thank you for your input. Have a good one.

02:49:14.880 --> 02:49:16.880
You too. Later.

02:49:16.880 --> 02:49:23.880
Okay, I apologize to those folks we didn't get to on Skype. We'll get to you guys next week.

02:49:23.880 --> 02:49:25.580
promise

02:49:25.580 --> 02:49:32.540
But we promise the chatters we did get to some ask orange lounge. So therefore that's what we're gonna do right now some ask orange lounge

02:49:39.700 --> 02:49:46.460
Let's ask orange lounge some stupid question. What will we find out this week on orange lounge radio?

02:49:47.140 --> 02:49:52.140
Maybe we'll find out how to unhook a bra or maybe not. I

02:49:52.140 --> 02:49:57.140
I don't know. I don't want to finish that thought. Um...

02:49:57.140 --> 02:49:58.140
You rhymed anyway.

02:49:58.140 --> 02:50:01.140
Sakurina says,

02:50:01.140 --> 02:50:07.140
I want to plug dsmeat.com, which is a DS Friends code sharing site that Loki joined, apparently.

02:50:07.140 --> 02:50:09.140
Loki, is this true? Are these allegations true?

02:50:09.140 --> 02:50:12.140
Yeah, but I haven't visited the site since then. I was bored.

02:50:12.140 --> 02:50:15.140
I thought our buddy Big Red Pimp started his own thing.

02:50:15.140 --> 02:50:20.140
Yeah, and you know what's funny is because I couldn't log into that thing at all because it was broken.

02:50:20.140 --> 02:50:24.140
email him and tell him he'll fix it. I just don't care. He loves you. Alright, uh,

02:50:24.140 --> 02:50:30.780
Sakarina wants to know, am I the only one to think Snow by Ram when you guys talk about snow?

02:50:32.620 --> 02:50:37.340
And I say no, you're probably not the only one to think about that song. However, that does make you

02:50:37.340 --> 02:50:47.820
a loser. Just kidding. Hearts, love you. Just kidding. Sephiroth1215 says, what do you think

02:50:47.820 --> 02:50:50.820
What do you think is the most overrated DDR song?

02:50:50.820 --> 02:50:53.820
I say Butterfly, says Sephiroth1215.

02:50:53.820 --> 02:50:55.820
Most overrated DDR song?

02:50:55.820 --> 02:50:57.820
Max 300, hands down.

02:50:57.820 --> 02:50:59.820
Hands down, Max 300.

02:50:59.820 --> 02:51:00.820
Darkstalker?

02:51:00.820 --> 02:51:02.820
Yeah, I'd have to agree.

02:51:02.820 --> 02:51:03.820
Max 300? Loki.

02:51:03.820 --> 02:51:04.820
Huh?

02:51:04.820 --> 02:51:06.820
Most overrated DDR song?

02:51:06.820 --> 02:51:09.820
Overrated DDR song, max period.

02:51:09.820 --> 02:51:10.820
Oh.

02:51:10.820 --> 02:51:11.820
We all said maxes.

02:51:11.820 --> 02:51:14.820
And will you be my Animal Crossing friend?

02:51:14.820 --> 02:51:15.820
Aww.

02:51:15.820 --> 02:51:17.820
Only if you let me abuse your town folk.

02:51:19.820 --> 02:51:21.820
I'm going to leave signs in your town.

02:51:21.820 --> 02:51:23.820
Yeah, and let us paint your town.

02:51:24.820 --> 02:51:26.820
We'll paint your town gay.

02:51:27.820 --> 02:51:29.820
We're going to come gay up your town.

02:51:30.820 --> 02:51:32.820
With the makeover, girlfriend!

02:51:37.820 --> 02:51:39.820
I'm going to put up signs and just have bras on them.

02:51:40.820 --> 02:51:42.820
That should be the new Orange Lounge logo.

02:51:42.820 --> 02:51:46.660
the new orange lounge logo I really hope that the town lesbian comes back by the

02:51:46.660 --> 02:51:49.100
way I want to say just in time for Christmas because I don't know why bras

02:51:49.100 --> 02:51:55.060
make me think of this but the orange lounge t-shirt it's gonna happen we got

02:51:55.060 --> 02:51:59.100
a company to say they do it I'm very excited so we're gonna talk about that

02:51:59.100 --> 02:52:04.860
later gonna do it we're gonna do it illusion wants to know what do you think

02:52:04.860 --> 02:52:09.940
is truly truly truly outrageous gem in the holograms or the misfits not the

02:52:09.940 --> 02:52:18.020
punk band, the original Misfits. I would say, you know, Jem was the shit. The Misfits were

02:52:18.020 --> 02:52:23.660
just a bunch of fucking wannabes. I'm sorry. Except the Misfits had Jetta later on, and

02:52:23.660 --> 02:52:29.100
she played a black saxophone. True. It doesn't get cooler than that. Your thoughts, Jem or

02:52:29.100 --> 02:52:38.020
the Misfits? I think the entire show sucked. Yeah, well, I think you smell like butt. Spirit

02:52:38.020 --> 02:52:44.100
Snare would like to know what is the meaning of life the universe and

02:52:44.100 --> 02:52:53.900
everything to the X 42 purple it's 42 really purple that's the whole purpose

02:52:53.900 --> 02:52:58.820
of the earth was to calculate the meaning of life and it's 42 purple Loki

02:52:58.820 --> 02:53:03.660
the meaning of life is to listen to orange launch radio every Sunday night

02:53:03.660 --> 02:53:06.380
at 6.30 Pacific Standard Time?

02:53:06.380 --> 02:53:07.820
Um, no.

02:53:07.820 --> 02:53:11.340
Oh, Jesus Christ, Renee just reminded me of something.

02:53:11.340 --> 02:53:13.620
Have any of the hosts had a memorable moment?

02:53:13.620 --> 02:53:14.360
Oh, this is from Renee.

02:53:14.360 --> 02:53:19.500
Playing any DDR or music game in front of a crowd of sorts.

02:53:19.500 --> 02:53:22.140
I have an alter ego known as Dr. Dick that

02:53:22.140 --> 02:53:24.100
does improv freestyle at some tournaments

02:53:24.100 --> 02:53:28.380
and got quite a big crowd at Pier 39 doing.

02:53:28.380 --> 02:53:29.300
What song did I do?

02:53:29.300 --> 02:53:31.660
Was it Cowgirl I did at that one?

02:53:31.660 --> 02:53:33.420
No, the first time was It's Raining Men.

02:53:33.420 --> 02:53:36.620
Yeah. Was it Shaft 2 or something? Yeah, Shaft.

02:53:36.620 --> 02:53:40.380
And the second time Dr. Dick came out was doing Cowgirl

02:53:40.380 --> 02:53:43.820
at B3 is what it was called. Good times.

02:53:43.820 --> 02:53:46.860
Loki, I think of one involving you.

02:53:46.860 --> 02:53:50.820
One of the first times I met you was at the sacramentals cosplay and tournament

02:53:50.820 --> 02:53:54.820
and you did your routine Dynamite Rave, like when you were dressed up all over your style.

02:53:54.820 --> 02:53:57.540
Oh yeah, I completely forgot. And you fucking failed.

02:53:57.540 --> 02:54:02.740
That's because I forgot my steps. You started dancing and you were like getting down and doing the whole thing and then you were like

02:54:02.740 --> 02:54:05.740
Like you froze for a minute and you were like, aw shit, and then you failed.

02:54:05.740 --> 02:54:07.740
I wasn't like, what, the first time you...

02:54:07.740 --> 02:54:13.740
I was like, that guy rocked. No, it was, it was later on. But this is pre-OLR. This is pre-OLR.

02:54:15.740 --> 02:54:21.740
Alright. DarkSakura, do you have any? I can think of one. It was you and me, but...

02:54:21.740 --> 02:54:23.740
What, doing stomp to my beat?

02:54:23.740 --> 02:54:24.740
Yeah.

02:54:24.740 --> 02:54:26.740
And beating each other with the orange bats?

02:54:26.740 --> 02:54:30.020
because we were pissed off that we got disqualified from perfect attack so we

02:54:30.020 --> 02:54:33.580
entered freestyle couples freestyle at the last minute and we went to Rite Aid

02:54:33.580 --> 02:54:38.260
and bought big orange bats and a little plastic trumpet and we worked we worked

02:54:38.260 --> 02:54:41.580
so hard on this we were so like we finished this whole freestyle routine a

02:54:41.580 --> 02:54:44.940
couple of hours I believe this video is still still on DDR freak somewhere

02:54:52.500 --> 02:54:57.500
I'm watching me dance. We worked really hard on the finishing technique where Dark Sakura

02:54:57.500 --> 02:55:01.840
would whack me in the crotch with her bat, and that was the finishing move. It was great.

02:55:01.840 --> 02:55:06.440
And then Iguana Girl and some other guy. Her ex. Yeah, that guy. Yeah. Stood behind us

02:56:35.860 --> 02:56:44.860
I think he meant why did I type that with a D when it should have been a G.

02:56:44.860 --> 02:56:51.860
Okay, it's supposed to be S-U-K-O.

02:56:51.860 --> 02:56:54.860
Oh, who cares.

02:56:54.860 --> 02:56:56.860
I'm trying to say it's Koshi.

02:56:56.860 --> 02:56:57.860
Oh, who cares.

02:56:57.860 --> 02:57:00.860
No, I need to correct you, thank you.

02:57:00.860 --> 02:57:08.180
Nintendo Maniac, what he really wants to know, is a Mario Kart DS online record of 199 wins

02:57:08.180 --> 02:57:09.860
and 34 losses good?

02:57:09.860 --> 02:57:13.460
Yeah, but it means you do need to go outside more often.

02:57:13.460 --> 02:57:14.460
Maybe race a real car.

02:57:14.460 --> 02:57:15.460
Just kidding.

02:57:15.460 --> 02:57:16.460
Just kidding.

02:57:16.460 --> 02:57:17.460
Question for Loki.

02:57:17.460 --> 02:57:18.780
Can I race you in Mario Kart DS again?

02:57:18.780 --> 02:57:22.140
I remember that you're anti-snaking, Loki.

02:57:22.140 --> 02:57:27.900
I guess if I'm on, I mean.

02:57:27.900 --> 02:57:31.740
jaded 2005 what is the best metal DER pad because I want to get one for

02:57:31.740 --> 02:57:41.420
Christmas red octane's afterburner honestly Roz why wouldn't the Java IRC

02:57:41.420 --> 02:57:44.780
client work I couldn't get into it and it made me late for the show chat

02:57:44.780 --> 02:57:48.460
sadness I don't know because that's done by another company but I'll look into it

02:57:48.460 --> 02:57:52.580
and see if it's just you or if it breaks for us too and if it breaks for us too

02:57:52.580 --> 02:58:00.420
then we'll have to, uh, spank it. Sephiroth1215, by the way, had a follow-up.

02:58:00.420 --> 02:58:09.420
That's okay if we want to visit his village, but please don't gay it up.

02:58:09.420 --> 02:58:15.260
Legend of Zaku says, how come mainstream youth media outlets such as MTV only care about

02:58:15.260 --> 02:58:19.860
rap and sports games? Because that, unfortunately, is what the people are buying, and if the

02:58:19.860 --> 02:58:24.580
people stop buying that shit they will not promote it anymore is my thought

02:58:24.580 --> 02:58:34.180
because of cock yeah cock what what she got you to say cock oh by the way I have a

02:58:34.180 --> 02:58:37.340

02:58:48.700 --> 02:58:50.700
Very, very Margaret Cho gave.

02:59:18.700 --> 02:59:29.680

Sakura all right you have outgave me that's just my favorite song movie all

02:59:46.340 --> 02:59:48.660
All right, question from Dark Tetsuya.

02:59:48.660 --> 02:59:50.780
Have you seen the Carl's Jr. Milkshake commercial,

02:59:50.780 --> 02:59:53.580
and do you find it ironic that they used Get Busy

02:59:53.580 --> 02:59:55.740
since they had the DDR promotion last month?

02:59:58.060 --> 03:00:00.700
Well, that would not be busy.

03:00:00.700 --> 03:00:03.100
That thing, miss, cannot, cannot shake.

03:00:03.100 --> 03:00:05.460
That thing, miss, cannot, cannot shake.

03:00:05.460 --> 03:00:06.300
That thing, miss, cannot, cannot shake.

03:00:06.300 --> 03:00:10.460
You know, I can't, look, why would you use,

03:00:10.460 --> 03:00:14.060
why would you use that song when there's the completely

03:00:14.060 --> 03:00:21.060
The more obvious song that you use in your milkshake commercial.

03:00:21.060 --> 03:00:26.060
My milkshake brings all the boys to the yard, and their life is better than yours.

03:00:26.060 --> 03:00:28.060
Damn right, it's better than yours.

03:00:28.060 --> 03:00:30.060
Cause most people listen to, you know...

03:00:30.060 --> 03:00:34.060
Wait, hold on, hold on.

03:00:34.060 --> 03:00:36.060
E. Carl's Jr.

03:00:36.060 --> 03:00:41.060
See? I should produce commercials.

03:00:41.060 --> 03:00:46.980
forgot about the DDR promotion last month my bed goggle says what is your

03:00:46.980 --> 03:00:50.620
favorite Christmas song my favorite Christmas song is little drummer boy

03:00:50.620 --> 03:00:54.500
because I get to say perumpa pump pump I also grandma got run over by reindeer

03:00:54.500 --> 03:01:01.060
a close second my favorite one is dancing around a women's underwear okay

03:01:01.060 --> 03:01:04.060
Okay. Loki? Christmas at Ground Zero.

03:01:04.060 --> 03:01:07.060
It's Christmas at Ground Zero.

03:01:07.060 --> 03:01:08.060
Alright. One more.

03:01:08.060 --> 03:01:11.060
Actually, I also like the night Santa went crazy.

03:01:11.060 --> 03:01:13.060
Last one, last one.

03:01:13.060 --> 03:01:18.060
Neodude0 wants to know, do any of you play Magic the Gathering?

03:01:18.060 --> 03:01:19.060
I used to.

03:01:19.060 --> 03:01:20.060
I used to.

03:01:20.060 --> 03:01:22.060
I had, I had like all blackboarded cards.

03:01:22.060 --> 03:01:24.060
They were betas and alphas.

03:01:24.060 --> 03:01:26.060
I still have my fourth edition stuff.

03:01:26.060 --> 03:01:28.060
NERD!

03:01:28.060 --> 03:01:33.060
Yeah, but I don't play it anymore. I can play sometimes.

03:01:33.060 --> 03:01:38.060
Sometimes late at night, you take them out, and you tickle yourself with them.

03:01:38.060 --> 03:01:43.060
Actually... Oh dear.

03:01:43.060 --> 03:01:46.060
I need to tap my mana. Tap my mana.

03:01:46.060 --> 03:01:49.060
I need another Thrall token!

03:01:49.060 --> 03:01:51.060
At least I didn't say Felden's Cane.

03:01:51.060 --> 03:01:54.060
Oh gee, god damn lady.

03:01:54.060 --> 03:01:57.060
I need me an acid manipulator.

03:01:57.060 --> 03:02:05.620
Alright. That, uh, I hate this show. Alright. That, that's, that's gonna do it because I

03:02:05.620 --> 03:02:09.740
hate this show. Uh, we're gonna finish up and, uh, put the nail in the proverbial coffin

03:02:09.740 --> 03:02:14.180
of this program. Uh, thank you, folks, for listening. We'll be back next week with more

03:02:14.180 --> 03:02:21.460
of the same shit that you know and love. Um, final thought time. Angel! I hope you had

03:02:21.460 --> 03:02:27.020
a good show. Yes, I did. Good. And good people came over and it was all good. Good. Well,

03:02:27.020 --> 03:02:30.020
What's your final thought, my dear?

03:02:30.020 --> 03:02:32.020
Must get that job.

03:02:32.020 --> 03:02:33.020
Yes.

03:02:33.020 --> 03:02:36.020
Good luck, my friend. Loki, final thought.

03:02:36.020 --> 03:02:37.020
Must eat more brownies.

03:02:37.020 --> 03:02:39.020
Stop stuffing your face with brownies.

03:02:39.020 --> 03:02:41.020
How much weight have you gained since the biggest gainer started?

03:02:41.020 --> 03:02:42.020
I don't know. I haven't checked.

03:02:42.020 --> 03:02:44.020
We haven't done weigh-ins in my weeks.

03:02:44.020 --> 03:02:46.020
I know. Well, Extover's not here, so...

03:02:46.020 --> 03:02:49.020
But I've been uber-sick, so...

03:02:49.020 --> 03:02:51.020
So we'll do another weigh-in next week.

03:02:51.020 --> 03:02:53.020
But I win anyway.

03:02:53.020 --> 03:02:55.020
I know. Darkstalker, your final thought?

03:02:55.020 --> 03:03:00.700
I hope them over the plague soon, but the final, the really, really major thing is reject

03:03:00.700 --> 03:03:03.060
false icons.

03:03:03.060 --> 03:03:08.180
My final thought is velcro bras, the wave of the future.

03:03:08.180 --> 03:03:10.020
That's it.

03:03:10.020 --> 03:03:14.820
One word, one word to sum it all up, the final word of the show, the nail in the coffin,

03:03:14.820 --> 03:03:17.940
it is Angel's birthday, I will let her have the final word.

03:03:17.940 --> 03:03:18.940
What is it my friend?

03:03:18.940 --> 03:03:19.940
See you next week.

03:03:19.940 --> 03:03:20.940
