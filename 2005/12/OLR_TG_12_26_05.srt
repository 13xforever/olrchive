How you doing choke choke gasp? What did you did you get coal in your stocking this year again?

13
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:57,280
Actually, I did get coal in my stocking.

14
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:59,280
Awesome. That was from me.

15
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:01,280
No, actually it was from Dan.

16
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:04,280
It was in a little tin box that said lump of coal and it did have a lump of coal in it.

17
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:06,280
Is that all he got you?

18
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:10,280
No, I got the most romantic gift of Dawn of the Dead.

19
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:12,280
Cool.

20
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:16,280
And Serenity, of course, and a $500 car stereo and speakers.

21
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:18,280
Nice.

22
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:20,280
Nice. What did Dan get me for Christmas?

23
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:22,280
A kick in the butt.

24
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:25,360
Over there in the corner is the one and only Loki.

25
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:29,000
Hello. How you doing? I'm okay. Alright.

26
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,720
What did you do for the Christmas day or holiday or whatever you did?

27
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:36,800
I hung out with family. That's pretty much it, yeah. Did you get anything? Get some loot?

28
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:39,960
I got salami.

29
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:44,760
What an awesome present! I don't think that's a game. I haven't heard of salami.

30
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:49,320
I got three different types of salami. Peppered salami, which

31
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:54,000
That stuff is really peppery. I mean, there's a ton of pepper on the outside of that thing.

32
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,640
It gives you some serious heartburn if you eat too much of it.

33
00:01:57,640 --> 00:02:00,560
There was some Italian dry salami in there, and then some other stuff.

34
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:03,160
It's the Swiss colony, the game!

35
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:06,640
Help the Swiss miss! Save our supply of bee sticks! No one gets me games for Christmas

36
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:07,960
because they know

37
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:11,160
that I, you know, for one, I do

38
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:14,600
work at a company that sells games, and I get tons of games anyways, and then I buy

39
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:16,160
whatever I want.

40
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:17,240
Good point.

41
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:18,600
You know, makes it tough.

42
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:19,920
Good point, good point.

43
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:23,580
Alright, well of course happy holidays from us here at Orange Launch Radio to you

44
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:27,080
guys and we are a day late this week because of the holidays. You know, give us

45
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:27,920
a break.

46
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:30,120
We're entitled to a vacation every once in a while,

47
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:34,380
but we're here doing the show for you guys tonight. I was actually playing a game.

48
00:02:34,380 --> 00:02:38,520
Well, what a good segue into how was your gaming week? Dark Sakura, what did you

49
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:41,800
play? Trivial Pursuits. I don't think...

50
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:46,120
Was that on a console? No, we did Couples Trivial Pursuits.

51
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:50,920
Me and Dan and his cousins and significant others and wives and things.

52
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:54,040
This is not a board game podcast. There are some board game podcasts.

53
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:58,960
Oh my god. Of which we are not one. So what kind of console or computer games are you playing?

54
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:02,920
I started Papa Lacrosse, then Dan took the PSP away from me,

55
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:09,600
which I was very upset with. Yeah, I found my game sitting on my computer

56
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:11,600
desk and the PSP was gone.

57
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:15,240
I was like, well great. So I've been playing a lot of Animal Crossing

58
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:17,920
very cool

59
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:21,320
And I finally got to see Need for Speed Underground on

60
00:03:22,380 --> 00:03:29,520
The 360 and actually I don't know why the hell Dan was talking about it looking slower because it really didn't it was gorgeous

61
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:34,320
It makes the the Xbox 360 look like a PlayStation game

62
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:40,000
grainy and pixely and the 360 version is pretty

63
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,160
wait a minute you said it made the Xbox 360 version look like a PlayStation game

64
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:44,160
you mean the Xbox version?

65
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:45,160
the Xbox version looked like it

66
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:46,440
I was confused for a minute

67
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:47,440
most wanted yeah

68
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:48,440
got it

69
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:49,440
yeah most wanted sorry

70
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:52,720
but it was a minute yeah it was really really sweet

71
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:53,720
nice

72
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:56,880
just the cop chases were awesome on it

73
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:57,880
that's it?

74
00:03:57,880 --> 00:03:58,880
for now

75
00:03:58,880 --> 00:03:59,880
For now.

76
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:00,880
Alright.

77
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:01,880
Oh.

78
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:02,880
Well, meow, miss thing.

79
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:03,880
Alright.

80
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:06,560
Somebody woke up on the wrong side of the sleigh.

81
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:07,880
What's going on?

82
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:08,880
Maybe under the sleigh.

83
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:09,880
Alright.

84
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:11,800
Loki, how was your gaming week?

85
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:15,960
I just played a lot of multiplayer games, you know, typical work stuff.

86
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:22,700
Grand Theft Auto Liberty City Stories, we actually have our six-man teams now, so it's

87
00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:24,800
really dense.

88
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:31,000
There's tons of people running around in that game which is fun and it makes it really challenging.

89
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:36,560
But I don't know, other people are getting better now so it's given me more of a challenge

90
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:37,560
which is good.

91
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:41,640
And then Call of Duty 2 we've been playing multiplayer during lunch which is really cool

92
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:44,960
and I actually need to play the single player version of the game because it would be really

93
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:45,960
nice.

94
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:52,880
And then of course Animal Crossing Wild World we've been playing almost every day now.

95
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:56,980
I don't know, it's a real easy game to pick up, play for like 10 minutes and put down.

96
00:04:56,980 --> 00:04:58,900
So that's why I kind of like it.

97
00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:04,100
And I don't have to play it every day like friggin' Nintendogs, which I might add I haven't

98
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:07,500
played in a long time thinking about selling my last copy too.

99
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:09,240
Oh wow.

100
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:13,500
My puppies are probably flea-ridden and rabid by now.

101
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:17,540
You know, I was worried that Animal Crossing was going to turn out the same way as Nintendogs.

102
00:05:17,540 --> 00:05:20,300
Now that the game's been out for a little while, what do you think?

103
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:24,540
this something you're gonna still be playing six months from now or I'm sure

104
00:05:24,540 --> 00:05:27,620
I'll get tired of it after a while because six months there's a lot of good

105
00:05:27,620 --> 00:05:30,820
games they're gonna come out between them but it is gonna be a game they'll

106
00:05:30,820 --> 00:05:36,980
be playing for at least another couple months for sure I know I played the Game

107
00:05:36,980 --> 00:05:40,700
Cube one like all year just to get all the stuff like so they don't know that

108
00:05:40,700 --> 00:05:43,660
holidays are in this one because the Japanese version didn't have holidays

109
00:05:43,660 --> 00:05:49,380
um there's different holidays there's politically correct holidays so

110
00:05:49,380 --> 00:05:53,000
retarded. I love the festive candle that was in there which is the menorah and the

111
00:05:53,000 --> 00:06:02,040
festive tree with you know Christmas tree like but you know it it was never

112
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:06,340
mind for me the squirrel said it all for me so I'll just let direct people to the

113
00:06:06,340 --> 00:06:11,320
recent for me the squirrel Christmas thing yeah that's how I feel about it

114
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:16,260
all right check it out is that it anything else you want to add? That's pretty much it yeah.

115
00:06:16,260 --> 00:06:21,980
Um, my gaming week was um, you know pretty uneventful honestly because I didn't really get a whole lot of new stuff

116
00:06:21,980 --> 00:06:28,420
So I've been basically as promised last week Final Fantasy for Advance has been taking up a lot of my time

117
00:06:28,940 --> 00:06:30,940
and I

118
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:34,460
Also was playing Animal Crossing for a little bit and checking out some other stuff

119
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:39,440
So I decided I wanted to get into something new but there wasn't a whole lot of new games that were out that I wanted

120
00:06:39,580 --> 00:06:41,260
So I've been seeing

121
00:06:41,260 --> 00:06:46,260
commercials on TV and looking around the internet lately and I've heard a lot about this service game tap

122
00:06:46,260 --> 00:06:50,360
I don't know if you guys out there have heard of this game taps this thing where you can like

123
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:55,820
Play I think something like 300 games is what they boast in their category 300 games on demand

124
00:06:55,820 --> 00:06:57,660
It's like an on-demand gaming service

125
00:06:57,660 --> 00:07:04,680
It's a very interesting business model because it's set up basically so that you pay a monthly service fee

126
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:06,920
Which is right now. I think they're running a special where it's

127
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:13,800
It's a two-week free trial and a $9.95 a month for 12 months, but I think normally it's about

128
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:17,600
$14.95 a month is what they charge, so I'm not sure how long their special is running

129
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:18,600
for.

130
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:21,880
But what I think is interesting is that they say, hey, this is how much you'd pay for WOW

131
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:27,180
or other comparable MMOs, so I thought that was kind of an interesting way to plug it.

132
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:31,780
But of course the games that are accessible in the library are older games, but if you've

133
00:07:31,780 --> 00:07:35,880
been listening to the show for a while, you know that I'm really into these retro collections.

134
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:40,480
I mean this year alone. I've talked about what one of the Midway arcade treasures that came out

135
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:45,640
We got the Taito legends and the Tecmo collection all that stuff

136
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:48,920
I bought the Namco collection, which was a horrible collection. But anyway

137
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:56,800
Namco games are actually in the game tap game tap has you know contracts with or some type of agreement with many game publishing companies

138
00:07:57,260 --> 00:07:59,820
Such as I noticed Sega Activision Sierra

139
00:07:59,820 --> 00:08:05,860
and Namco, not that all the games from these companies are in the library, but a few other

140
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:10,620
notable ones, like Pac-Man is in the library, Dig-Dugs, those type of things, but what's

141
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:14,500
interesting also, not every game, you know, Nintendo, you're not going to see anything

142
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:20,180
by Nintendo in here, but the GameTap library has all these different areas, you can either

143
00:08:20,180 --> 00:08:24,480
sort it by genre, you can sort it by the system, which I thought was very interesting, I did

144
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:28,440
not realize when I first downloaded it that they actually had Dreamcast games in there,

145
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:29,440
There's not very many.

146
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:31,000
There's only three Dreamcast games available.

147
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:35,120
I remember Hydro Thunder and Mr. Driller are both in there, but I thought it was very interesting

148
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:40,160
that Dreamcast isn't that old, all things considered, so it was kind of neat to see

149
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:41,400
that in there.

150
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:49,680
They also have some relatively recent PC games in there, some of the Tomb Raider games, Tom

151
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:57,240
Clancy games are in there, some of the Worms games, and just an interesting variety of

152
00:08:57,240 --> 00:09:01,960
stuff inside game tap so if you're a retro gaming fan or you're just the type

153
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:05,860
that you know likes to check out old games you like to buy things that are in

154
00:09:05,860 --> 00:09:09,860
the bargain bin I think this is worth checking out I'll tell you what it's got

155
00:09:09,860 --> 00:09:14,160
a really slick interface to it I would actually say the game tap is sort of

156
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:19,680
becoming like the iTunes of classic gaming and in a way like okay think

157
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:23,160
about iTunes what is the light is you allows you to download music legally

158
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:29,720
right but a lot of people just download their music from what what are the

159
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:33,640
services out there now with a closed winmx they got what what's the

160
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:37,600
underground stuff out there bit torrent or you know you could download songs off

161
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:41,540
of there but yet you run the risk that you're gonna get songs that aren't a

162
00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:45,920
good quality get fakes you get things that are you know bogus and you know

163
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:50,720
just the general fact that you know you're stealing shit so um what's

164
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:53,780
What's interesting about GameTap is it's almost like that, but now we're talking about like

165
00:09:53,780 --> 00:09:55,840
abandonware and emulation.

166
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:59,160
And I think this is the first time, and I would say it's kind of taken the industry

167
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:03,260
long enough, with the exception of these retro packs and things, this is really the first

168
00:10:03,260 --> 00:10:10,000
time that I can recall seeing like a PC kind of trying to legalize the abandonware and

169
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,560
emulation scene, which could be bad news for those people, because as this gets more and

170
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:16,920
more prevalent, you know, I think they're going to go after those types of sites, the

171
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:17,920
ones that they haven't already.

172
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:24,240
But you know, $9.95 a month, not too shabby, it's a pretty reasonable price when you consider

173
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:27,240
that you're usually paying that much for one MMO.

174
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:33,440
So Interface is very sleek, games download pretty quickly unless you're playing a newer

175
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:39,580
game that was originally on CD, like I played Mr. Driller on Dreamcast, it took 11 minutes

176
00:10:39,580 --> 00:10:43,720
to download, but you can play other games in the background, like while that's downloading

177
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:47,880
I can play something on Atari 2600, and what I also thought was very interesting

178
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:52,000
about GameTap and this is something I don't think a lot of people are mentioning is that

179
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:58,400
GameTap is owned by Turner Broadcasting, which you know, owns a lot of television stations,

180
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:02,600
and so they produce their own programming for this GameTap service.

181
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:06,840
One of the things they push is this MediaPlex that has their own little channels, like they

182
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:11,720
have like a reality show to pick the next GJ as they're calling it, like a game jockey

183
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:15,340
or whatever, you know, cheesy but okay, whatever.

184
00:11:15,340 --> 00:11:19,100
And then they also have these little commercials that, you know, play while you're waiting

185
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:26,720
to download the games, and they kind of show like, you know, like a Dig Dug short funny

186
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:31,840
thing or Pac-Man or whatever, what was it, like Galaxian or there's other stuff in there.

187
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:36,080
So what I thought was kind of neat about that is that a lot of the stuff I was seeing on

188
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:41,860
GameTap is probably better than anything I've seen on G4TV the past year.

189
00:11:41,860 --> 00:11:45,540
So that kind of makes me go, hmm, very interesting.

190
00:11:45,540 --> 00:11:50,460
And you know, if there's anybody from GameTap out there listening, by chance, seriously,

191
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:53,760
I'm pretty impressed with what you guys are doing programming-wise.

192
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:56,060
And I'm like, why don't you guys start a station?

193
00:11:56,060 --> 00:11:59,300
Because I don't know if you guys are aware right now, but gamers are pretty much being

194
00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:04,180
robbed very slowly of the only representation we pretty much had on TV, which was G4, which,

195
00:12:04,180 --> 00:12:09,140
you know, bought tech TV and then now is, you know, replacing their shows like Filter

196
00:12:09,140 --> 00:12:13,500
G4TV.com with repeats of the man show and repeats of Fastlane.

197
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:17,180
Okay people, no one watched Fastlane the first time for a reason.

198
00:12:17,180 --> 00:12:22,100
Okay? I want to know why they're showing Star Trek The Next Generation.

199
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:25,340
Yeah, and now that too, it's like, WTF people.

200
00:12:25,340 --> 00:12:28,820
Star Trek The Next Generation, they've become Spike now?

201
00:12:28,820 --> 00:12:32,380
They're Spike for kids is what they're turning into. Anyway, this is about GameTap.

202
00:12:32,380 --> 00:12:36,260
I'm pretty impressed because it seems like, you know what, the people at GameTap

203
00:12:36,260 --> 00:12:39,260
seem to know what they're doing, unlike the folks at G4.

204
00:12:39,260 --> 00:12:43,660
So, if this is promising that they might

205
00:12:43,660 --> 00:12:47,300
try to do a station at, I think it will be really neat to see.

206
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:51,660
So, as a gamer who feels underrepresented on the cable box right

207
00:12:51,660 --> 00:12:52,940
now, I think that's very interesting.

208
00:12:52,940 --> 00:12:56,540
And GameTap, you know, that would be a good name for a station anyway.

209
00:12:56,540 --> 00:13:00,180
Things to consider. Anyway, so the services, so that's cool, I like the media,

210
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:00,860
that's a big plus.

211
00:13:00,860 --> 00:13:05,300
The service itself, you know, it does have some issues now, I had some graphical

212
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:05,860
glitches,

213
00:13:05,860 --> 00:13:10,660
I have had the system lock up completely when some of the video tries to download.

214
00:13:10,660 --> 00:13:15,260
I don't know if that's my system specifically or if that's, you know, maybe more people are going to have problems with that.

215
00:13:15,260 --> 00:13:16,160
I don't know.

216
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:21,860
But anyway, I do recommend GameTap, especially if you're a fan of, like, retro gaming things.

217
00:13:21,860 --> 00:13:27,360
You know, it's a two-week free trial. Check it out. Why not? You know, it's pretty cool.

218
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:31,260
I think it's one of those things that's going to get better with time, because it's still in the early stages,

219
00:13:31,260 --> 00:13:34,660
and I know they recently signed deals with Capcom and some other publishers as well,

220
00:13:34,660 --> 00:13:38,500
And I think I read some of they want to grow to like a thousand games by this time in a year

221
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:43,540
So I think it's gonna be very interesting to see where the service is at a year from now to see if it really does

222
00:13:43,540 --> 00:13:49,260
Get the support from the gaming community. I think you know what you could pay $19.95 for one of these retro collections

223
00:13:49,260 --> 00:13:54,140
Or you go for this. I think this is worth checking out and so I recommend game tap

224
00:13:54,140 --> 00:13:58,060
I you guys got to see it very briefly. I showed it to you guys real quick. What do you think?

225
00:13:58,060 --> 00:14:02,340
What do you think of this idea it has potential? Mm-hmm definitely has potential

226
00:14:02,340 --> 00:14:06,700
That's about all I can and so I get to play it and see what the gameplay is like. Mm-hmm

227
00:14:07,540 --> 00:14:13,820
Loki it looked good. I like it. I mean even something really cool if it was like on a

228
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:19,580
Set top, you know console thing like if they could come out with some sort of really bare-bones

229
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:25,020
Wireless controller thing kind of like the Phantom, you know, they were talking about doing you know all streaming

230
00:14:26,020 --> 00:14:31,640
That model could works if the fan sucks, but I don't know it looks good though

231
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:38,580
I mean, it's definitely something worth checking out especially if you've got definitely wanted some controllers or something for your PC

232
00:14:38,580 --> 00:14:43,640
You know why going? Yeah, that's my other complaint, but that's not game taps fault is that my controller sucks

233
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:46,180
So it's not I mean it is neat the game tab

234
00:14:46,180 --> 00:14:49,400
You know picked it right up and it knew what kind of controller I had but it sucks

235
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:52,200
I need to get something better if I want to use controller, but still though

236
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:55,840
I mean it looks good and I like the way the interface was that was really cool

237
00:14:55,840 --> 00:15:00,160
Actually now as somebody who often reports on this program about what's going on underground

238
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:01,360
ground

239
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:04,280
which you see would you actually papers on the like a tap

240
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:08,980
uh... no because i don't have enough time to actually sit there and go play a

241
00:15:08,980 --> 00:15:10,540
lot of games online

242
00:15:10,540 --> 00:15:13,760
let alone pay ninety and no nine ninety five a month for something

243
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:15,180
mean look i have

244
00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:18,880
i some still subscribe to file fancy eleven god knows why haven't played the

245
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:20,360
game like six months

246
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:22,140
but uh...

247
00:15:22,140 --> 00:15:25,620
sure i don't know i guess you know i think that's going to be most people

248
00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:28,240
sticking point we came to have is that there's not a lot of new stuff on there

249
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:32,040
So if you want to play the new, cutting-edge stuff, GameTap's probably not for you.

250
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:35,840
Okay, GameTap's more of like a library, but, you know, it shows potential, and maybe, you

251
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:38,920
know what, who knows, companies might pick up on this model.

252
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:41,760
The other thing I wanted to say, before we get into the news, I'm sorry to spend so much

253
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:45,480
time on this, but it, because this really made me think about this, the whole GameTap

254
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:49,440
thing is, it really made me think about, I bet you anything, this is how Nintendo Revolution's

255
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:50,440
going to be set up.

256
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:53,580
I bet you Nintendo Revolution, with its old Nintendo Classics, because when I started

257
00:15:53,580 --> 00:15:56,960
not seeing the Nintendo games in GameTap, I thought, you know what, Nintendo Revolution,

258
00:15:56,960 --> 00:16:03,320
I bet you this is going to be the same model. Choose your console, choose 9.95 a month, 14.95 a month, whatever they're going to charge,

259
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:07,800
and then the unlimited play of the old Nintendo games. I bet you anything, Revolution is going to have the same business model.

260
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:14,960
Or they could just do something very similar to Xbox Live, where you have the silver, which doesn't allow you to play the old games or whatever,

261
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:20,240
and then you can pay the gold, which is 9.95, you get all the old games from all the systems,

262
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:24,200
plus whatever other crap that they throw on there as well for download.

263
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:26,520
It would be interesting to see what happens.

264
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:28,520
Anyway, let's get into some news for tonight.

265
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:33,640
I'm going to start it off and talk about, why not, let's talk about the Xbox 360.

266
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:37,600
Kind of been the talk of the last two months.

267
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:41,680
Microsoft of course has been shipping out a little more and more now and they're saying

268
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:45,340
that they're going to start doing these weekly shipments, but you know, a lot of people still

269
00:16:45,340 --> 00:16:46,760
say, you know, don't hold your breath.

270
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:49,560
If you didn't pre-order, you're still not getting one of these until March if you're

271
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:53,220
an EB Games or GameStop shopper.

272
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:58,460
magazine newspaper, San Jose Mercury News, actually said Microsoft is disappointed that

273
00:16:58,460 --> 00:17:01,620
it can't get more units of the Xbox 360 into the market.

274
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:04,860
So Microsoft has that regret there.

275
00:17:04,860 --> 00:17:08,100
So I don't know what that's about because you think they'd do something about it.

276
00:17:08,100 --> 00:17:12,500
But anyway, what's interesting is that the reporter from the San Jose Mercury News, Dean

277
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:17,940
Takahashi, also said in his personal blog, various folks tell me that the shortage isn't

278
00:17:17,940 --> 00:17:19,820
a problem with chip yields.

279
00:17:19,820 --> 00:17:23,020
I think it's more of a systems issue when the boxes come together.

280
00:17:23,020 --> 00:17:27,740
working on getting more units out so this guy saying that maybe it's not the

281
00:17:27,740 --> 00:17:31,340
chip shortage the fact they just can't package them fast enough which is a

282
00:17:31,340 --> 00:17:35,460
little disappointing if that's really it because you think they would have gotten

283
00:17:35,460 --> 00:17:38,420
the resources. I think they might be afraid that they're running into these

284
00:17:38,420 --> 00:17:42,780
glitches that people are running into now with the overheating stuff they're

285
00:17:42,780 --> 00:17:47,100
trying to get more working units that don't have these same problems that

286
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:51,460
could be it and so you know comes down a quality control problem or something

287
00:17:51,460 --> 00:17:54,820
I don't know who cares either way they're not getting them to source

288
00:17:54,820 --> 00:17:59,000
fact I did see it looks like the local GameStop they got some more in because I

289
00:17:59,000 --> 00:17:59,420
saw

290
00:17:59,420 --> 00:18:05,340
someone very quietly moving one of the premium consoles from the back room into

291
00:18:05,340 --> 00:18:09,660
you know under the counter I was like ahhh interesting okay

292
00:18:09,660 --> 00:18:13,500
well now now that's just one particular story I got from the internet now

293
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:17,220
Dark Soccer you have another story about the shipment of Xbox 360s

294
00:18:17,220 --> 00:18:22,540
Well, there's a bit of word out because they were checking about Microsoft UK as far as

295
00:18:22,540 --> 00:18:26,140
if they were going to get their shipments out and they said that they're actually on

296
00:18:26,140 --> 00:18:36,700
track to meet their 90-day forecast that they had out of 2.75 to 3 million units to go out.

297
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:42,520
As far as the US shipment is concerned, there's a quote that I found that says they're working

298
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:47,240
around the clock to deliver as many Xbox 360 consoles as humanly possible.

299
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:53,780
There is, though, a pretty rampant disappointment throughout Microsoft US about how low the

300
00:18:53,780 --> 00:18:55,200
shipments have been.

301
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:58,480
I still think it's purposeful, but...

302
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:00,320
We'll see, we'll see.

303
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:02,600
Now, Loki, you have a story also...

304
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:04,960
Actually, there's one more thing about that.

305
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:12,640
Actually it was asked about that and said that they, that there was any, Microsoft's

306
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:17,440
competitors are actually even thinking that they're legitimate, that the shortage is legitimate.

307
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:21,120
The quote from Sony's Phil Harrison says that, I don't believe that for a second.

308
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:24,640
I think that it's clear that they're making every unit that they can, whether that is

309
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:27,440
enough for demand or that they can't make enough is a question you'll have to put to

310
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:28,440
Microsoft.

311
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:30,080
But it's definitely not done on purpose.

312
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:33,040
That's an interesting little support from the competition there.

313
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:34,040
Yeah.

314
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:38,280
Loki, you have some news about relating to the Xbox Live Diamond Account now?

315
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:40,160
There's silver, gold, and diamond now?

316
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:41,160
What the hell is this?

317
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:42,160
Well, it's a diamond card.

318
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:44,820
It's not necessarily anything that you have to pay for.

319
00:19:44,820 --> 00:19:50,560
If you have an Xbox Live Gold membership, you can actually subscribe using your gamertag

320
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:52,560
to this diamond card.

321
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:56,520
It's basically this little card that you get that has this cool little graphics on there

322
00:19:56,520 --> 00:20:02,200
plus your gamertag, and they have a bunch of affiliates with Microsoft that are offering

323
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:03,200
discounts for it.

324
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:05,520
It's kind of like one of those discount cards that you get.

325
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:15,940
So basically if you go to Xbox, I believe it's xboxlivediamondcard.com, let me see here

326
00:20:15,940 --> 00:20:20,600
real quick, it's xboxlivediamond.com, that's what it was.

327
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:25,200
You go there, you put your gamer tag in, and you sign up and they'll basically ship it

328
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:28,060
to your address that you have signed up with.

329
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:31,340
What if you have an Xbox regular live account?

330
00:20:31,340 --> 00:20:32,340
No dice?

331
00:20:32,340 --> 00:20:41,620
it nope ah sucks give it the times folks anyways no but um some of the um actual affiliates that

332
00:20:41,620 --> 00:20:47,460
they have right now they're talking about like mcdonald's um i saw what was it like carls jr

333
00:20:47,460 --> 00:20:53,060
burger king type stuff on there um i know as well just what a gamer needs fast food yeah

334
00:20:53,060 --> 00:20:59,060
yeah that's exactly how about how about getting some fresh choice discounts in there hey yo hey

335
00:20:59,060 --> 00:21:03,060
No, no, no. They've got like, for example, and this is actually on the website, they

336
00:21:03,060 --> 00:21:08,540
have a Hollywood video where you rent a movie or a video game and get the second rental

337
00:21:08,540 --> 00:21:15,540
free. Sam Goody, 10% off DVDs and CDs. Quiznos, you know, buy a sandwich, get the second one

338
00:21:15,540 --> 00:21:25,540
free. 50% off of Cambridge Soundworks speakers. 20% off of Etnies shoes. This is a big, you

339
00:21:25,540 --> 00:21:26,540
know, list of stuff.

340
00:21:26,540 --> 00:21:33,340
I'm going over to Dark Soccer because maybe she'll back me up on this.

341
00:21:33,340 --> 00:21:39,900
Is it just me or could Xbox be the moralist here and offer discounts to like 24 Hour Fitness?

342
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:47,020
I wish they would but you know they're going to cater to, sorry the typical gamer, I hate

343
00:21:47,020 --> 00:21:54,260
to say it but I don't know many average gamers who are into fitness and health.

344
00:21:54,260 --> 00:21:58,720
I mean, I know lots who are, yeah, but, you know, if you think about your average,

345
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:04,520
say your college, the stereotype, like the college frat boy, no.

346
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:10,660
And on top of that, honestly, promoting a lazy lifestyle helps their business.

347
00:22:10,660 --> 00:22:19,660
which has Wi-Fi for the DS. McDonald's or Fresh Choice? I make my point.

348
00:22:19,660 --> 00:22:21,660
Fresh Choice is only in California.

349
00:22:21,660 --> 00:22:28,660
Oops, sorry, I made a regional joke. Jamba Juice? Is that nationwide? That's borderline healthy.

350
00:22:28,660 --> 00:22:31,660
They don't have Jamba Juice in my part of Alabama.

351
00:22:31,660 --> 00:22:33,660
Ah, forget it then.

352
00:22:33,660 --> 00:22:35,660
So you know what they need to have?

353
00:22:35,660 --> 00:22:36,660
What?

354
00:22:36,660 --> 00:22:41,560
It's like they have the live fitness bikes that you can watch TV or listen to your CD

355
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:42,560
player on.

356
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:48,900
They need to have one with like an Xbox 360 hooked up to it, so it will shut down if you

357
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:49,900
stop pedaling.

358
00:22:49,900 --> 00:22:51,220
There you go.

359
00:22:51,220 --> 00:22:54,700
Or if you pedal too fast and it gets too hot.

360
00:22:54,700 --> 00:22:55,700
Lame.

361
00:22:55,700 --> 00:23:01,660
All right, Loki, speaking of Xbox 360, what the hell is going on with Dead or Alive 4?

362
00:23:01,660 --> 00:23:06,580
It's actually been delayed again, but this time only a couple more days.

363
00:23:06,580 --> 00:23:11,380
It's actually, the people that have been reviewing the final copy, which is supposedly going

364
00:23:11,380 --> 00:23:17,780
gold here pretty soon, actually gave it 100%, just a really good game.

365
00:23:17,780 --> 00:23:23,180
They're basically working on the online, make sure it's very balanced, and they just wanna

366
00:23:23,180 --> 00:23:25,900
make sure the game's good before it goes out.

367
00:23:25,900 --> 00:23:30,520
And supposedly now the new date is January 2nd, it's gonna be the new ship date on it.

368
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:35,580
So expect it in stores around the 3rd, hopefully it won't get pushed back again but I haven't

369
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:39,080
heard anything yet on it and they would have probably already given us news already if

370
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:42,860
that were the case. So some gamers out there want to hold on to those gift cards? Absolutely.

371
00:23:42,860 --> 00:23:47,880
Yeah definitely. And to be honest, there is nothing coming out in the next two weeks other

372
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:52,780
than Dead or Alive. Okay, I mean let's put it this way. Last week for games, there was

373
00:23:52,780 --> 00:23:57,500
two games that came out. There was King Kong on the PSP and Pocket Dogs on the Game Boy

374
00:23:57,500 --> 00:24:03,100
Advance. That is it. Oh god, we covered that in a previous show. That is it. Nothing, nada.

375
00:24:03,100 --> 00:24:07,140
And now we're just talking about Dead or Alive 4 for this next week.

376
00:24:07,140 --> 00:24:11,420
Only game coming out on the consoles, and then the next week there's a couple games,

377
00:24:11,420 --> 00:24:12,420
and then that's it.

378
00:24:12,420 --> 00:24:14,980
Then your next big game is going to be 25 to Life.

379
00:24:14,980 --> 00:24:18,200
And then, Jamie, you were saying that UK's lineup looks pretty similar.

380
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:20,180
It's pretty much a ghost town for a little while.

381
00:24:20,180 --> 00:24:21,180
Yeah.

382
00:24:21,180 --> 00:24:25,020
The softer, the next big, you know, sell period comes up.

383
00:24:25,020 --> 00:24:26,020
Yeah.

384
00:24:26,020 --> 00:24:27,020
All right.

385
00:24:27,020 --> 00:24:28,020
Interesting.

386
00:24:28,020 --> 00:24:29,620
All right, let's do some console balance here.

387
00:24:29,620 --> 00:24:30,860
We've talked enough about Xbox 360.

388
00:24:30,860 --> 00:24:32,300
Let's talk a little bit about PS3.

389
00:24:32,300 --> 00:24:34,300
I know Dark Sakura has a story about

390
00:24:34,420 --> 00:24:37,020
Finally, we know like a game that might be coming to ps3

391
00:24:39,060 --> 00:24:45,820
Actually unreal tournament 2007 is coming out for the PlayStation 3 and it's set in spring 2006 I

392
00:24:46,620 --> 00:24:52,660
Think the date is almost more interesting than the announcement of the game itself. That's great. Yeah, it's actually pretty cool

393
00:24:52,660 --> 00:24:58,940
I mean, I don't think it's too surprising that it's gonna be on PlayStation 3. Mm-hmm, but just the I

394
00:24:58,940 --> 00:25:03,100
I mean honestly, to be out so quickly?

395
00:25:03,100 --> 00:25:06,460
That's surprising to me, but actually I'm not so surprised

396
00:25:06,460 --> 00:25:10,500
or I mean I am a little bit surprised by the fact that it's coming on PS3 because

397
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:14,780
when I think about Unreal Tournament previous games, I think of Xbox

398
00:25:14,780 --> 00:25:18,340
but maybe that's just because that's where I owned Unreal before I sold it back

399
00:25:18,340 --> 00:25:19,340
finally because I was bored of it

400
00:25:19,340 --> 00:25:23,380
but, you know, I kind of always thought of it as an Xbox title, but yeah

401
00:25:23,380 --> 00:25:28,740
Well, I have a feeling that we're gonna see it on Xbox 360

402
00:25:28,740 --> 00:25:36,260
Mmm, but just that it's gonna be a I'm just sort of the whole announcement together. Right? It's sort of like the whoa

403
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:43,120
They could do a grand theft auto San Andreas where they put it out on one console exclusively for

404
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:48,560
You know XML months nine months or whatever and then they bring it out in the other systems later

405
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:55,440
Now I have a story about Nintendo revolution and that actually has to do a Zelda Twilight Princess is that

406
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:57,600
in

407
00:25:57,600 --> 00:26:03,220
In a Nintendo magazine released in Europe, it's actually NGC and their January 2006 issue,

408
00:26:03,220 --> 00:26:08,080
they're saying that Twilight Princess is going to be using the Revolution controller.

409
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:11,840
There's a quote here, our development team has decided to take extra time to add some

410
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:13,880
incredible elements.

411
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:19,960
There were elements that Miyamoto said were simply far too good to leave out.

412
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:23,080
We kind of heard about the delays the first time being the fact that they're going to

413
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:27,600
add something revolution special here so it looks like the controller is a big

414
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:28,640
part of that so kind of

415
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:32,680
pieces together with what we heard about the delay the first time so that whole

416
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:36,040
innovative controller thing will somehow come into play with

417
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:39,360
the revolution. Interesting. Yeah.

418
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:42,520
That's really all I got on the revolution. There's not a whole lot of other news. You got something?

419
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:46,520
I got something real quick on the PlayStation 3 which I thought was very interesting.

420
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:49,360
Everyone's wondering if the Blu-ray thing they were talking about region coding

421
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:51,320
whether they're actually just going to get rid of it

422
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:55,280
or what's going on. Well at least for the U.S. and

423
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:58,600
Japanese there's not going to be a real big issue because the

424
00:26:58,600 --> 00:27:02,600
region coding for the blu-ray has been announced and Japan and U.S.

425
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:05,880
are in the same region code which should be very interesting.

426
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:08,880
Unfortunately Europe, they're gonna be

427
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:13,480
getting the bone again as they put in this article here because they're in a

428
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:14,320
different region.

429
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:18,080
Well that's not a surprise because their TVs are a different format.

430
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:21,320
With the high def TVs, I would have figured they're all the same format now.

431
00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:24,800
Yeah, but how many people really have high def?

432
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:29,080
Alright, anyway, Loki, you had a story now about two of the systems here,

433
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:31,160
PlayStation 3 versus

434
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:33,880
Xbox 360 and what Microsoft's kinda...

435
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:37,280
The whole thing with the 360, it's always been from

436
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:41,480
the get-go that whenever the PlayStation 3 was gonna come out, they were gonna

437
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:44,560
launch Halo. So it's only fitting

438
00:27:44,560 --> 00:27:47,600
that when they're gonna announce the PlayStation 3 launch, that they're gonna

439
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:51,160
announce the Halo 3 launch which is supposedly going to happen at the

440
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:56,520
Consumer Electronics Show 2006 which is happening actually in January here so

441
00:27:56,520 --> 00:28:01,880
few more weeks and we'll know a little bit more about Halo 3 hopefully at least

442
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:06,200
that's what's going to be rumored to go down Microsoft's little trump card is

443
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:11,760
that we got Halo 3 you know what though I'm sorry to say but I mean Halo is a

444
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:16,280
pretty good game but a lot of the other games are coming out like Gears of War

445
00:28:16,280 --> 00:28:21,420
right now they're really good and this game better be damn amazing like you'll

446
00:28:21,420 --> 00:28:24,920
break through good in order for you know for two because pretty soon people are

447
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:27,900
gonna get to the point where hey Larry hey will threes come out oh well good

448
00:28:27,900 --> 00:28:31,720
for you you know I don't know I think there's just there's a hardcore enough

449
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:35,000
fan base for halo that it won't matter halo 3 could blow goats and it wouldn't

450
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:38,720
matter it's halo you know I don't think it will though I do think it'll raise

451
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:42,820
the bar because you know III have high expectations and I don't think I'll be

452
00:28:42,820 --> 00:28:48,460
disappointed but we'll see time will tell anyway let's move on and dark

453
00:28:48,460 --> 00:28:51,700
soccer you know she's got to keep us in check sometimes especially during this

454
00:28:51,700 --> 00:28:55,260
holiday season because you know you guys might be sitting there and you're

455
00:28:55,260 --> 00:28:58,340
playing these games all day long but you remember to go outside once in a while

456
00:28:58,340 --> 00:29:01,660
play in the snow unless you're in California then play in the rain play in

457
00:29:01,660 --> 00:29:05,700
the mud play in the mud and if we you know sat around and played video games

458
00:29:05,700 --> 00:29:11,840
all day long we'd have no time to go out and get drunk off eggnog so anyway dark

459
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:14,140
DarkSakura is here to give us her advice column.

460
00:29:14,140 --> 00:29:18,120
DarkSakura, what are you going to tell the kids about this week?

461
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:21,960
Today's piece of advice is how to stop a runaway one horse open sleigh.

462
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:25,440
Now, things that could have been brought to my attention last week, DarkSakura.

463
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:29,540
Sorry, I didn't know that you were going and riding in a one horse open sleigh.

464
00:29:29,540 --> 00:29:30,540
That's alright.

465
00:29:30,540 --> 00:29:31,540
Tell me anyway.

466
00:29:31,540 --> 00:29:32,540
Number one.

467
00:29:32,540 --> 00:29:33,540
Stay in the sleigh.

468
00:29:33,540 --> 00:29:36,480
Grip the cedar railing with one hand and the reins with the other.

469
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:53,480
2. Grab the reins. If you cannot reach the reins, or they are loose and dragging on the ground, do not attempt to reach them. Hold on to the sleigh and wait for the horses to tire.

470
00:29:53,480 --> 00:30:04,480
3. Tug and release the reins with a medium pressure. Repeat until the horse begins to slow down.

471
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:10,480
4. When the horse slows down to a slow lope or a chop, pull one rein to the side.

472
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:13,480
With steady pressure, move the horse's head all the way around toward you.

473
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:16,480
This will cause the horse to begin going in a circle.

474
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:19,480
The horse will quickly tire of circling and slow to a walk.

475
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:23,480
5. Pull back with steady pressure on both reins until the horse stops.

476
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:26,480
But my final, final piece of advice...

477
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:27,480
Yes, ma'am?

478
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:40,560
take a taxi big political news going on I'm loving this game politics comm site

479
00:30:40,560 --> 00:30:45,000
it's the place for me to catch up on all the drama that's going on with various

480
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:48,680
you know legislations and stuff they ran a couple stories this week about of

481
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:52,400
course the California video game law being blocked by a federal judge I don't

482
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:55,080
know if you heard about this we were hopefully if you listen to the show

483
00:30:55,080 --> 00:30:58,080
you've heard about it, because we talked about it a lot when it first came out.

484
00:30:58,080 --> 00:31:04,420
Well, a federal judge, that would be Judge Ronald White, actually blocked it, and somebody

485
00:31:04,420 --> 00:31:09,220
I guess filled game politics in on the fact that the games were protected by the First

486
00:31:09,220 --> 00:31:12,760
Amendment, said Judge White, children have First Amendment rights, and the concept of

487
00:31:12,760 --> 00:31:14,900
strict scrutiny applies.

488
00:31:14,900 --> 00:31:18,140
So very interesting, basically it's a First Amendment violation, as a lot of critics said

489
00:31:18,140 --> 00:31:19,380
it was going to be.

490
00:31:19,380 --> 00:31:20,380
So very interesting.

491
00:31:20,380 --> 00:31:26,700
Now, of course, rebuttal, coming from Yee, Assemblyman Yee, who was the one who originally

492
00:31:26,700 --> 00:31:32,660
wrote this bill, basically a type of, you know, the injunction is a temporary phase,

493
00:31:32,660 --> 00:31:37,340
blah, blah, blah, we're confident that common sense will prevail, blah, blah, blah.

494
00:31:37,340 --> 00:31:39,020
I thought this part was interesting.

495
00:31:39,020 --> 00:31:43,640
Judge White's 17-page opinion granting the injunction made clear that while a preliminary

496
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:48,100
injunction may be necessary in the short term, he also challenged some of the claims made

497
00:31:48,100 --> 00:31:49,660
by the plaintiffs.

498
00:31:49,660 --> 00:31:57,060
He indicated that despite the claims of the ESA and the VDA that the act is far too burdensome

499
00:31:57,060 --> 00:32:01,900
to apply as a standard to video game products, that the act should be simple enough for an

500
00:32:01,900 --> 00:32:05,700
ordinary person to apply the games submitted to the court.

501
00:32:05,700 --> 00:32:08,580
But then I also thought that was kind of interesting.

502
00:32:08,580 --> 00:32:12,260
Medical data clearly indicates that these ultra-violent video games have harmful effects

503
00:32:12,260 --> 00:32:16,420
on kids, and thus we have a state interest to protect them, blah, blah, blah, you know

504
00:32:16,420 --> 00:32:17,420
where that's going.

505
00:32:17,420 --> 00:32:22,580
actually crap did you bring up something at the exact opposite on a previous show

506
00:32:22,580 --> 00:32:25,580
well first of all the Department of Justice has proven that there has been

507
00:32:25,580 --> 00:32:31,860
we're actually at an a 30-year all-time low in violence among youth first of all

508
00:32:31,860 --> 00:32:35,220
secondly is that just because all the kids are killing each other so there's

509
00:32:35,220 --> 00:32:40,180
less to commit crimes kidding it takes but it would have to take some sort of

510
00:32:40,180 --> 00:32:46,700
really fucked up in the head child to just go out and say oh I play Unreal

511
00:32:46,700 --> 00:32:54,140
tournament I'm gonna go kill everybody in my school stupid I feel like the

512
00:32:54,140 --> 00:32:59,540
comment about common sense and I do think common sense did prevail oh snap

513
00:32:59,540 --> 00:33:03,300
yeah I just I don't we've had this debate for the past six months so I'm

514
00:33:03,300 --> 00:33:06,340
almost a little done with it but my biggest issue with the California law

515
00:33:06,340 --> 00:33:11,300
was the fact that it didn't set a clear regulation seemed like the bill was open

516
00:33:11,300 --> 00:33:15,740
to a lot of interpretation so I hope if it is going back to the drawing board I

517
00:33:15,740 --> 00:33:20,780
hope that's what they work on is some type of clear set guideline some type of

518
00:33:20,780 --> 00:33:24,620
third-party board reviews these games and gives them the rating whatever just

519
00:33:24,620 --> 00:33:28,660
you know as I've said many times for they should be done just like movies

520
00:33:28,660 --> 00:33:33,060
what's the big deal that's how they are done in Europe you know what I'm

521
00:33:33,060 --> 00:33:36,500
disappointed about what Arnold Schwarzenegger really what is the

522
00:33:36,500 --> 00:33:41,300
problem with him with the Terminator let a lot like this be appealed so simply

523
00:33:41,300 --> 00:33:45,500
no the Terminator go out and kill the bastards that you know try to appeal to

524
00:33:45,500 --> 00:33:46,500
this law.

525
00:33:46,500 --> 00:33:51,680
Arnold Schwarzenegger should be just ruling California with an iron fist.

526
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:53,940
You better should quit and go back to movies again, because...

527
00:33:53,940 --> 00:33:54,940
I just...

528
00:33:54,940 --> 00:33:56,940
Can we switch topics, please?

529
00:33:56,940 --> 00:34:00,660
Please, just because I think he's so pathetic that he's not going to get re-elected, but

530
00:34:00,660 --> 00:34:01,660
still.

531
00:34:01,660 --> 00:34:04,700
Oh, you can send those cards and letters to DarkSakura, care of Orange Lawns Radio?

532
00:34:04,700 --> 00:34:07,740
Oh, togo at orangelawnsradio.com, actually.

533
00:34:07,740 --> 00:34:08,740
Yeah.

534
00:34:08,740 --> 00:34:09,740
Oh.

535
00:34:09,740 --> 00:34:10,740
Send those flowers.

536
00:34:10,740 --> 00:34:11,740
Oh, let's see.

537
00:34:11,740 --> 00:34:12,740
Oh.

538
00:34:12,740 --> 00:34:18,500
gonna like go buy an island when I'm rich and infamous and create a dark

539
00:34:18,500 --> 00:34:25,640
sakura land where I'm you know goddess of the island. Where King Kong lives? No I don't like

540
00:34:25,640 --> 00:34:32,300
big hairy apes and bad adaptations of movies. Moving on moving on this is the

541
00:34:32,300 --> 00:34:35,740
week of course where everybody's got to whip out their best of the year list

542
00:34:35,740 --> 00:34:39,860
right because you know we're in that time where it's almost the the first of

543
00:34:39,860 --> 00:34:44,340
2006 so everybody I don't know we feel this need in our society to rank things

544
00:34:44,340 --> 00:34:47,420
like we've got to have a frickin best game of the year so of course some of

545
00:34:47,420 --> 00:34:51,740
the game sites are getting in on the fun game spy has released their list of the

546
00:34:51,740 --> 00:34:56,620
top 10 games of the year here they are 10 Tom Clancy splinter cell chaos theory

547
00:34:56,620 --> 00:35:03,180
on Xbox 9 Legend of Zelda diminished cap Game Boy Advance 8 Dragon Quest 8

548
00:35:03,180 --> 00:35:08,900
journey the cursed King PlayStation 2 7 Half-Life 2 on the Xbox 6 Battlefield 2

549
00:35:08,900 --> 00:35:15,900
on the PC, 5 Call of Duty 2 on the Xbox 360, 4 Mario Kart DS on the Nintendo DS, 3 God

550
00:35:15,900 --> 00:35:21,900
of War on the Playstation 2, 2 Resident Evil 4 on the GameCube, and 1 Civ 4 on the PC.

551
00:35:21,900 --> 00:35:24,200
It was their number one game of the year.

552
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:27,260
GameSpot also did their game of the year, but they do it a little differently.

553
00:35:27,260 --> 00:35:31,020
They nominate, and then they name one as the game of the year, nominated, they nominated

554
00:35:31,020 --> 00:35:38,740
Battlefield 2, Civilization 4, F.E.A.R., Forza Motorsport, God of War, Guild Wars, Guitar

555
00:35:38,740 --> 00:35:45,300
hero, Mario Kart DS, Ninja Gaiden Black, and the winner was Resident Evil 4 on the GameCube.

556
00:35:45,300 --> 00:35:49,620
So I thought we could get in on the fun, but you know what guys, I don't want to name the

557
00:35:49,620 --> 00:35:53,780
best game of the year, because you know what, we're gamers, and you're going to disagree

558
00:35:53,780 --> 00:35:59,040
with us no matter what we say, so we're going to say our favorite game of 2005, and try

559
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:02,800
to stay away from that whole controversial best of thing, because even though we like

560
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:05,100
to think we're important, we know we're not.

561
00:36:05,100 --> 00:36:07,660
So what were our favorite games of 2005?

562
00:36:07,660 --> 00:36:13,060
I just want to know a runner-up and a best of and why so Loki your runner-up for best game of 2000

563
00:36:13,060 --> 00:36:16,420
My runner-up for best game of 2005 would be burnout

564
00:36:17,620 --> 00:36:21,340
Legend or burnout revenge actually screw burnout legends burnout legends sucked

565
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:24,780
Burnout revenge. I played that game non-stop

566
00:36:25,780 --> 00:36:27,780
for months it just

567
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:33,900
Really fun. The only thing it lacked was good single-player mode, but just really fun

568
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:37,940
and I'm really looking forward to Burnout Revenge when it comes out in the 360.

569
00:36:37,940 --> 00:36:39,540
Of course, my top game for...

570
00:36:39,540 --> 00:36:45,580
No, no, no, no, no, no, hold on, hold on, let's get it on, I want to do my own app too!

571
00:36:45,580 --> 00:36:50,020
Alright, let's see, my runner-up for best game of the year, I would say probably the

572
00:36:50,020 --> 00:36:54,140
runner-up I would call best game of the year would probably be...

573
00:36:54,140 --> 00:36:58,620
This is a tough one for me, and when you put this next to my game of the year, I'm going

574
00:36:58,620 --> 00:37:00,940
to get some interesting reaction, but I would say my runner-up for best game of the year

575
00:37:00,940 --> 00:37:08,660
would be Meteos on Nintendo DS because I thought it was such a great puzzle, it really started

576
00:37:08,660 --> 00:37:13,420
the wave of great games coming out for the DS and I thought it was a puzzle with a lot

577
00:37:13,420 --> 00:37:17,720
of replayability value to it, but I got to admit, as far as DS goes, this is a very close

578
00:37:17,720 --> 00:37:22,540
call for me with Mario Kart DS, but my problem with Mario Kart DS is that it did feel a little

579
00:37:22,540 --> 00:37:25,820
bit rushed and I don't think the online was polished enough for me to really consider

580
00:37:25,820 --> 00:37:31,060
it a game of the year title but I do acknowledge the Nintendo has made leaps

581
00:37:31,060 --> 00:37:34,340
and bounds in that whole online world thing and I think Mario Kart said a

582
00:37:34,340 --> 00:37:37,660
great precedent but I don't think I could call it my favorite game of the

583
00:37:37,660 --> 00:37:42,420
year because medios got a lot more play for me so medios would be my runner-up

584
00:37:42,420 --> 00:37:45,940
for game of the year dark soccer you're in or out for game of the year Animal

585
00:37:45,940 --> 00:37:51,260
Crossing Animal Crossing T has why because I don't know it's just I played

586
00:37:51,260 --> 00:37:57,280
it every day it's the first game that I have even when I was so busy with school

587
00:37:57,280 --> 00:38:03,640
I've made time for it every day awesome so it's it get definitely gets it sounds

588
00:38:03,640 --> 00:38:09,140
good Loki game of the year my game of the year is just from the fact that I

589
00:38:09,140 --> 00:38:13,840
play it the most is gonna be Grand Theft Auto Liberty City Stories and only

590
00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:17,320
reason why it's the game of the year for me because this game is pretty much the

591
00:38:17,320 --> 00:38:20,780
exact same thing as Grand Theft Auto 3 is for the multiplayer and this is

592
00:38:20,780 --> 00:38:25,940
something that they should have had ever since it came out on PlayStation 2.

593
00:38:25,940 --> 00:38:31,260
There's no doubt about it that they shouldn't have at least brought it in by Vice City.

594
00:38:31,260 --> 00:38:34,980
It really needed to be in there, and the multiplayer part is literally the best part of the game

595
00:38:34,980 --> 00:38:40,580
for me, and I will be playing this game probably for months.

596
00:38:40,580 --> 00:38:46,500
My favorite game of the year, it's very interesting because I haven't seen this get a lot of,

597
00:38:46,500 --> 00:38:49,520
it got a lot of critical acclaim when it first came out, but it's noticeably absent from

598
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:51,040
on a lot of these top game of the year lists.

599
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:54,500
And honestly, this was a game that sold systems.

600
00:38:54,500 --> 00:38:57,580
This was a system seller, this was an amazing game.

601
00:38:57,580 --> 00:39:01,240
It revolutionized an entire genre of game.

602
00:39:01,240 --> 00:39:03,380
And I realize this is gonna sound a little weird

603
00:39:03,380 --> 00:39:05,660
when you put it next to my runner-up,

604
00:39:05,660 --> 00:39:07,000
because the fact that they were both made

605
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:09,500
by the same company, but my runner-up is really the game

606
00:39:09,500 --> 00:39:11,020
that I played a heck of a lot of,

607
00:39:11,020 --> 00:39:13,300
but my game of the year is something I gotta recognize,

608
00:39:13,300 --> 00:39:15,500
is being like it really pushed the bar.

609
00:39:15,500 --> 00:39:17,820
Luminous for the PSP is absolutely my favorite game

610
00:39:17,820 --> 00:39:19,220
that came out this year.

611
00:39:19,220 --> 00:39:25,320
I think it's the reason to have a PSP for me, it really is, and I know I sound like

612
00:39:25,320 --> 00:39:29,420
a total puzzle game addict when you put those two side by side, but they really did push

613
00:39:29,420 --> 00:39:31,180
the bar in different ways for their systems.

614
00:39:31,180 --> 00:39:36,420
This really was, considering we're looking at the year of the current gen systems going

615
00:39:36,420 --> 00:39:39,460
out the door and the next gen systems coming in the door, I think this year really was

616
00:39:39,460 --> 00:39:41,980
the year for handhelds to shine.

617
00:39:41,980 --> 00:39:46,020
I think having a DS and PSP title seems very fitting, and those two really raised the bar

618
00:39:46,020 --> 00:39:47,020
for me.

619
00:39:47,020 --> 00:39:51,520
Bitch, all you want about me picking two puzzlers by the same company back to back, but they

620
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:54,640
raised the bar for me in a way no other game could, and they're my picks, damn you.

621
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:56,040
Dark Soccer, your game of the year.

622
00:39:56,040 --> 00:40:01,440
The game that made Bimani fans everywhere forget that Guitar Freaks ever existed?

623
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:02,440
Guitar Hero?

624
00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:03,440
Very good.

625
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:04,440
Very good pick.

626
00:40:04,440 --> 00:40:05,440
Very good pick.

627
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:12,200
Because, I mean seriously, we were thinking about importing Guitar Freaks V when it comes

628
00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:13,200
out.

629
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:19,160
like why we have guitar hero which is so much more innovative than guitar freaks

630
00:40:19,160 --> 00:40:23,840
because all Konami's been doing is just recycle recycle recycle oh let's not do

631
00:40:23,840 --> 00:40:28,120
MIDI this time but guitar freaks actually makes it feel like you're

632
00:40:28,120 --> 00:40:33,840
playing a guitar I thought it was very very cool of you know red octane to come

633
00:40:33,840 --> 00:40:37,880
out to my house and say here you can play guitar freaks in your living room

634
00:40:37,880 --> 00:40:42,120
on TV and I thought that that was really cool they're trying to put that time and

635
00:40:42,120 --> 00:40:48,180
effort into it you know to try to make it something that that people would want

636
00:40:48,180 --> 00:40:52,780
to play not instead of just saying oh well we're doing something like guitar

637
00:40:52,780 --> 00:40:55,940
freaks no no no no no they they innovated on it and I thought that was

638
00:40:55,940 --> 00:41:03,060
pretty cool there you have it our picks for games of the year 2005 our picks

639
00:41:03,060 --> 00:41:08,460
there you have it all right moving on let's talk about dark cycle you had an

640
00:41:08,460 --> 00:41:12,700
There is an interesting kind of feature story about innovation in the scene, what is this

641
00:41:12,700 --> 00:41:13,700
all about?

642
00:41:13,700 --> 00:41:20,940
Yeah, speaking of innovation, there is an article up on GameSpot that I thought was

643
00:41:20,940 --> 00:41:23,220
pretty interesting.

644
00:41:23,220 --> 00:41:27,700
It was one that a friend of mine who is a game tester referred me to and I thought that

645
00:41:27,700 --> 00:41:31,340
it was pretty interesting.

646
00:41:31,340 --> 00:41:39,980
Basically it's, there's not so much of a lack of innovation as much as a lack of wanting

647
00:41:39,980 --> 00:41:45,700
to use that innovation that's going out, you know.

648
00:41:45,700 --> 00:41:52,340
There's actually a very good quote in here that says, innovation is dead, dying, every

649
00:41:52,340 --> 00:41:55,900
once in a while somebody will slip something in that will shock us but for the most part

650
00:41:55,900 --> 00:41:59,840
there's no money in innovation even if it's great.

651
00:41:59,840 --> 00:42:06,840
The industry is really looking for what do people already like and can we make a sequel.

652
00:42:06,840 --> 00:42:10,720
We are seeing such sequel-intensive titles now.

653
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:15,840
We see more Halos, more Metal Gear, more, you know, instead, you know, what was the

654
00:42:15,840 --> 00:42:17,800
last really innovative game that we got?

655
00:42:17,800 --> 00:42:22,120
I mean, for example, Luminous, I thought was a very good, but it's still a puzzle game.

656
00:42:22,120 --> 00:42:23,120
Well...

657
00:42:23,120 --> 00:42:26,520
Katamari Damacy now, that was innovation.

658
00:42:26,520 --> 00:42:28,980
But yeah, we got a sequel this year that really, well, you know...

659
00:42:28,980 --> 00:42:29,980
And it's more of the same.

660
00:42:29,980 --> 00:42:30,980
It is and it isn't.

661
00:42:30,980 --> 00:42:36,500
It did expand on it, but I couldn't name We Heart Katamari my game of the year because

662
00:42:36,500 --> 00:42:37,500
you're right.

663
00:42:37,500 --> 00:42:40,580
It wasn't as innovative as the first time you saw it, you know what I mean?

664
00:42:40,580 --> 00:42:45,500
The other quote in here, and by the way, this is by Webush Morgan Securities analyst Michael

665
00:42:45,500 --> 00:42:50,180
Pachter, I guess that's how his name is pronounced, says, �The best business for a publisher

666
00:42:50,180 --> 00:42:54,460
is to give people what you know they want, and what you know they want is a sequel to

667
00:42:54,460 --> 00:42:57,460
what they wanted last time, so we don't see a whole lot of innovation.�

668
00:42:57,460 --> 00:42:58,780
You know what's interesting to us, Sakura?

669
00:42:58,780 --> 00:43:00,940
I'm actually as you're saying this and talking about sequels and everything

670
00:43:00,940 --> 00:43:05,940
I'm looking at GameSpy's top 10 just up top my head here out of these 10 games on the list

671
00:43:06,300 --> 00:43:13,020
Only one of them is not a sequel or some type of story continuation type thing like, you know

672
00:43:13,100 --> 00:43:15,620
Tom Clancy Splinter Cell Chaos Theory, you know what I mean?

673
00:43:15,620 --> 00:43:18,620
Only one of these games God of War is a new title

674
00:43:18,620 --> 00:43:23,220
There's another good quote from here from him in here and this actually makes a lot of sense because I was just discussing this with somebody

675
00:43:23,220 --> 00:43:26,740
The other day I think with my well, it wasn't just with my husband

676
00:43:26,740 --> 00:43:30,360
it was with a couple other people because, you know, Dan and I talk games all the time.

677
00:43:30,360 --> 00:43:34,500
But it's another one from him that says, the problem I have with the whole sequel thing

678
00:43:34,500 --> 00:43:39,500
is it's not just sequels, it's once we see that World War II combat shooters work, we've

679
00:43:39,500 --> 00:43:43,600
got 50 of them, the funny thing is that the next year after we saw that, everyone thought

680
00:43:43,600 --> 00:43:47,580
if World War II worked, Vietnam would work too, but all those games were a disaster,

681
00:43:47,580 --> 00:43:51,840
now we've got how many more World War II games coming out.

682
00:43:51,840 --> 00:43:59,000
So we see them trying to go on the same path, and then it goes, no, no, no, we like this.

683
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:05,620
So on top of that, it's not necessarily that there's not a willingness to innovate as much

684
00:44:05,620 --> 00:44:10,920
as there's not a willingness of the consumer base to test an innovative product.

685
00:44:10,920 --> 00:44:15,120
No, and I have to laugh just because you're mentioning about the World War II shooters

686
00:44:15,120 --> 00:44:17,160
and the Vietnam ones not working.

687
00:44:17,160 --> 00:44:23,200
Speaking of other genres of war not working, I saw a game that was actually being put out

688
00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:26,520
by Vivida Universal and backed by the History Channel.

689
00:44:26,520 --> 00:44:29,480
It was a civil war, first person to share.

690
00:44:29,480 --> 00:44:31,480
Yeah, that's something that would work.

691
00:44:31,480 --> 00:44:34,800
DarkSocko, what do you think, I got a question for you.

692
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:39,400
What do you think of Nintendo's sort of response to this whole thing?

693
00:44:39,400 --> 00:44:44,360
It's kind of like Nintendo kind of sees, well, if the games aren't innovating, let's innovate

694
00:44:44,360 --> 00:44:48,760
the system and and kind of see what happens you see they're taking a big

695
00:44:48,760 --> 00:44:52,940
risk but that's why I say to is they're taking a big risk and Nintendo when you

696
00:44:52,940 --> 00:44:59,860
are Nintendo you can do no wrong yeah but the thing is is that I think that

697
00:44:59,860 --> 00:45:04,520
they're really resting on their laws quite a bit you know hey we're Nintendo

698
00:45:04,520 --> 00:45:07,880
we can get away with this crap and you'll like it cuz we said so cuz we're

699
00:45:07,880 --> 00:45:10,660
Nintendo do you think it's one of those things where it's like you know Nintendo

700
00:45:10,660 --> 00:45:13,960
sort of like they're gonna try this out but if even if they fail miserably they

701
00:45:13,960 --> 00:45:18,460
They could always turn the controller sideways, and it's just like any other console.

702
00:45:18,460 --> 00:45:19,960
You know what they're gonna do?

703
00:45:19,960 --> 00:45:22,960
I see them pulling an Xbox.

704
00:45:22,960 --> 00:45:24,960
Oh, you don't like this controller?

705
00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:25,960
Here's another one.

706
00:45:25,960 --> 00:45:28,960
You know, when we got the controller S, and now it's almost the standard?

707
00:45:28,960 --> 00:45:30,960
Interesting, yeah, true, true.

708
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:34,960
The controller S that we got over here was the same one released with the Japanese systems,

709
00:45:34,960 --> 00:45:37,960
which I knew people freaking importing that controller

710
00:45:37,960 --> 00:45:41,960
because it's so much more comfortable than the Humongoid controller.

711
00:45:41,960 --> 00:45:48,600
I'm sorry. I got these little small fingers. I wouldn't touch our Xbox. So the whole thing is that now um, I

712
00:45:49,320 --> 00:45:53,640
Think that's what's gonna happen with Nintendo's and people are gonna go. Oh, this controller is kind of stupid

713
00:45:54,120 --> 00:45:59,480
We want a real one. It's I don't know again more money in the Nintendo pocket, but but

714
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:04,200
If they put out the Zelda games and the Mario games and the which you know

715
00:46:04,200 --> 00:46:08,780
You could question is that really innovative? But if they put that kind of stuff out with the controller and it does well

716
00:46:08,780 --> 00:46:15,920
Well, I think that there's a very good example in here, though, of innovative projects that

717
00:46:15,920 --> 00:46:22,680
they've proven have worked, Psychonauts, where it was officially going to be an Xbox exclusive

718
00:46:22,680 --> 00:46:25,580
and Microsoft dropped it.

719
00:46:25,580 --> 00:46:31,040
They went to all over the place and Majesco, of course, picked it up.

720
00:46:31,040 --> 00:46:34,520
Again, it was on Xbox, PC, PS2.

721
00:46:34,520 --> 00:46:39,320
I think one of the ones that's listed in here that they went to was Vivendi, and they said

722
00:46:39,320 --> 00:46:42,920
they were interested in it, but said it was too risky.

723
00:46:42,920 --> 00:46:44,840
But it's been one of the...

724
00:46:44,840 --> 00:46:46,640
I haven't played enough of that game to really know, so...

725
00:46:46,640 --> 00:46:47,640
I haven't honestly played much.

726
00:46:47,640 --> 00:46:52,520
I've been considering it just because I've heard how, you know, neat it is, but still,

727
00:46:52,520 --> 00:46:56,680
I mean, you know, it's also, though, why we don't get a lot of the really awesome Japanese

728
00:46:56,680 --> 00:46:57,680
games, I think.

729
00:46:57,680 --> 00:47:01,840
You know, we never got, what, we never got, what, Psychic Force over here?

730
00:47:01,840 --> 00:47:05,340
Oh, we damn near didn't get Katamari Damacy. We didn't get Oz over here.

731
00:47:05,340 --> 00:47:05,840
No.

732
00:47:05,840 --> 00:47:06,340
So...

733
00:47:06,340 --> 00:47:10,340
You know, and on top of that, I think that's why it's taken so long for us to get DDR.

734
00:47:10,340 --> 00:47:14,840
Well, it's taken us so long. Like, we're just now getting BeatMania, and how long has it been out in Japan?

735
00:47:14,840 --> 00:47:16,340
Ninety...well...

736
00:47:16,340 --> 00:47:17,340
Ninety-three.

737
00:47:17,340 --> 00:47:19,840
Yeah, a long time. No, not that long.

738
00:47:19,840 --> 00:47:20,340
Yes.

739
00:47:20,340 --> 00:47:21,340
Really?

740
00:47:21,340 --> 00:47:21,840
Yeah.

741
00:47:21,840 --> 00:47:22,340
Ninety-three.

742
00:47:22,340 --> 00:47:22,840
It's been a while.

743
00:47:22,840 --> 00:47:27,340
Jeez. No, because the PlayStation...the first mix was on PlayStation. PlayStation was...well, shit, maybe.

744
00:47:27,340 --> 00:47:27,840
Oh, anyway.

745
00:47:27,840 --> 00:47:28,340
Ninety-three.

746
00:47:28,340 --> 00:47:30,340
Alright, whatever. So a long time.

747
00:47:30,340 --> 00:47:34,340
Well, keep in mind that the PlayStation was released in Japan in 1993.

748
00:47:34,340 --> 00:47:35,140
Yeah.

749
00:47:35,140 --> 00:47:38,740
Because we had mine in my dorm room in 1994, and it was new.

750
00:47:38,740 --> 00:47:39,700
Wow, wow, wow, wow.

751
00:47:40,900 --> 00:47:41,780
But it's just been...

752
00:47:42,580 --> 00:47:44,260
It takes forever for us to get anything,

753
00:47:44,260 --> 00:47:47,140
and their market, I think, is always looking for something new and fresh

754
00:47:47,140 --> 00:47:51,540
and something different because there's so much that's homogenous in their society.

755
00:47:51,540 --> 00:47:55,860
Do we have a skewed perspective, though, because we happen to be fans of those types of games,

756
00:47:55,860 --> 00:47:58,100
but maybe those games aren't really the ones that sell here?

757
00:47:58,100 --> 00:47:59,940
Because when you look at the American market,

758
00:47:59,940 --> 00:48:07,380
You know, despite our distaste towards these games, it is all about Madden, NBA Live, and

759
00:48:07,380 --> 00:48:08,380
all that stuff.

760
00:48:08,380 --> 00:48:09,380
You know?

761
00:48:09,380 --> 00:48:10,380
Is that why we...

762
00:48:10,380 --> 00:48:13,680
I honestly think that the average American has too narrow a scope to look for anything

763
00:48:13,680 --> 00:48:16,060
new and different beyond what they already know.

764
00:48:16,060 --> 00:48:19,340
Again, those cards and letters can go to...

765
00:48:19,340 --> 00:48:20,740
I said average.

766
00:48:20,740 --> 00:48:21,740
I know.

767
00:48:21,740 --> 00:48:26,300
And if you listen to this show, you've already demonstrated you have impeccable taste.

768
00:48:26,300 --> 00:48:30,580
Anyway, we've got to move on to another story, but that was a very, where was this again?

769
00:48:30,580 --> 00:48:31,580
I think this might be a good read.

770
00:48:31,580 --> 00:48:36,500
It was on, just the, I'll go ahead and give out the URL, it's at gamespot.com slash news

771
00:48:36,500 --> 00:48:41,820
slash 6141519.html.

772
00:48:41,820 --> 00:48:44,780
Very good article, I suggest everyone give it a thorough reading.

773
00:48:44,780 --> 00:48:49,980
Well, now let's counterbalance, Dark Soccer has given us something very thoughtful and

774
00:48:49,980 --> 00:48:54,580
a very good brain stimulant, let's go to the complete opposite end of the spectrum and

775
00:48:54,580 --> 00:48:57,580
Talk about Jack Thompson.

776
00:48:57,580 --> 00:49:03,240
Jack Thompson has bought stock in Take-Two Interactive, who publishes rock star games

777
00:49:03,240 --> 00:49:05,700
like The Warriors and Grand Theft Auto San Andreas.

778
00:49:05,700 --> 00:49:08,740
Why the hell would he do this when this is his main enemy, Dark Sakura?

779
00:49:08,740 --> 00:49:15,460
We brought up something on the live show about people complaining about Konami.

780
00:49:15,460 --> 00:49:20,460
As a stockholder, he has the right to challenge any business decision of the company.

781
00:49:20,460 --> 00:49:21,460
That's exactly what he's doing.

782
00:49:21,460 --> 00:49:23,960
He wants to be able to go to stockholder meetings.

783
00:49:23,960 --> 00:49:29,040
I have to say, as much as I loathe the man, that's frickin' brilliant.

784
00:49:29,040 --> 00:49:30,840
You know what's also brilliant?

785
00:49:30,840 --> 00:49:35,440
The fact that he hasn't re-registered his site, StopKill.com, which, by the way, domain

786
00:49:35,440 --> 00:49:37,360
is up for auction right now.

787
00:49:37,360 --> 00:49:40,240
So if you've got $60, you can actually go bid on it.

788
00:49:40,240 --> 00:49:41,240
Hey.

789
00:49:41,240 --> 00:49:42,240
Think about it.

790
00:49:42,240 --> 00:49:43,240
Think about it.

791
00:49:43,240 --> 00:49:47,240
That would be a great way to promote the show.

792
00:49:47,240 --> 00:49:48,240
All right.

793
00:49:48,240 --> 00:49:49,240
Of course, we'd get sued, but hey.

794
00:49:49,240 --> 00:49:50,240
No, we wouldn't.

795
00:49:50,240 --> 00:49:51,240
No, we would own it.

796
00:49:51,240 --> 00:49:52,240
Anyway, I don't know.

797
00:49:52,240 --> 00:49:53,240
We'll see.

798
00:49:53,240 --> 00:49:55,240
Weíll make ourselves one hell of an enemy.

799
00:49:55,240 --> 00:49:57,240
Do you all want to chip in 20 bucks?

800
00:49:57,240 --> 00:49:58,240
Iím in.

801
00:49:58,240 --> 00:49:59,240
Iím in.

802
00:49:59,240 --> 00:50:00,240
Letís do it.

803
00:50:00,240 --> 00:50:01,240
Letís do it.

804
00:50:01,240 --> 00:50:02,240
We are buying it.

805
00:50:02,240 --> 00:50:03,240
Loki, give me the URL.

806
00:50:03,240 --> 00:50:04,240
Weíll go bid on it.

807
00:50:04,240 --> 00:50:05,240
Iíll give you $20 right now.

808
00:50:05,240 --> 00:50:06,240
All right.

809
00:50:06,240 --> 00:50:07,240
Weíll go bid on it.

810
00:50:07,240 --> 00:50:08,240
Anyway, weíll see.

811
00:50:08,240 --> 00:50:10,240
This is the sound of my wallet unzipping.

812
00:50:10,240 --> 00:50:11,520
Weíll see what happens.

813
00:50:11,520 --> 00:50:12,520
More to come on that.

814
00:50:12,520 --> 00:50:14,840
Anyway, weíll talk offline about that.

815
00:50:14,840 --> 00:50:19,720
Also what I thought was interesting, there was a little dig here at Microsoft CEO Bill

816
00:50:19,720 --> 00:50:20,720
Gates.

817
00:50:20,720 --> 00:50:21,720
Whatís next?

818
00:50:21,720 --> 00:50:26,120
The game in which players can practice flying commercial jetliners into the World Trade Towers?

819
00:50:26,120 --> 00:50:28,440
Oh, I forgot. Microsoft already did that.

820
00:50:28,440 --> 00:50:30,640
Thank Time's Man of the Year, Bill Gates.

821
00:50:30,640 --> 00:50:33,920
Which I think is kind of a low blow. I mean...

822
00:50:33,920 --> 00:50:36,280
Come on.

823
00:50:36,280 --> 00:50:39,400
Sure, you can fly planes in two buildings, but...

824
00:50:39,400 --> 00:50:41,280
You crash.

825
00:50:41,280 --> 00:50:44,600
This is not exactly the point of the game, you dumbass.

826
00:50:44,600 --> 00:50:47,760
This is my open letter to Jack Thompson.

827
00:50:47,760 --> 00:50:51,160
Give up. Please just give up.

828
00:50:51,160 --> 00:50:53,360
People are laughing at you.

829
00:50:53,360 --> 00:50:56,560
Dog, I'm gonna laugh at you.

830
00:50:56,560 --> 00:51:00,360
We had a story about In the Groove, because we were talking about the guitar hero earlier.

831
00:51:00,360 --> 00:51:03,560
Let's talk about Red Octane's other music game that wasn't quite as critically acclaimed,

832
00:51:03,560 --> 00:51:04,760
but what's going on with In the Groove?

833
00:51:04,760 --> 00:51:09,760
In the Groove is coming to the PC, which is odd, because I thought it was already out

834
00:51:09,760 --> 00:51:12,760
on the PC when it was called StepMania.

835
00:51:12,760 --> 00:51:17,360
But yeah, apparently it's coming to the PC and Mac OS X.

836
00:51:17,360 --> 00:51:22,280
The features are going to be including a full editor for creating step edits like StepMania

837
00:51:22,280 --> 00:51:27,920
and the ability to save those edits to your USB memory card for use with In the Groove

838
00:51:27,920 --> 00:51:29,920
1 or 2 at the arcades.

839
00:51:29,920 --> 00:51:33,400
More info coming soon at inthegroove.com.

840
00:51:33,400 --> 00:51:37,000
Now for those people actually still playing StepMania, or as I like to call it, In the

841
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:45,000
Groove 3, you can actually download a brand new build of StepMania 4.0 which isn't finalized

842
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:46,000
yet.

843
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:51,520
Anyways, this one has Para Para support, which you can actually use the Japanese controller

844
00:51:51,520 --> 00:51:56,000
with, the USB one, and they've got some test songs on there as well, so definitely worth

845
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:57,000
checking out.

846
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:59,160
You can find all that at stepmania.com.

847
00:51:59,160 --> 00:52:03,120
Pada Pada Pada Dice, because you don't look fruity enough playing DDR.

848
00:52:03,120 --> 00:52:04,120
Exactly.

849
00:52:04,120 --> 00:52:06,920
Hey, we've seen fruity on that game.

850
00:52:06,920 --> 00:52:08,600
I know, I know.

851
00:52:08,600 --> 00:52:12,800
Drunken parties where people are throwing their girlfriends' clothing.

852
00:52:12,800 --> 00:52:24,800
If you want to send fan letters or hate letters or letters that encourage stimulating conversation

853
00:52:24,800 --> 00:52:28,660
or news tips. We get an awful lot of news tips from like our buddy Rob, and I...

854
00:52:28,660 --> 00:52:30,360
Let me guess, do we have a Rob mail this week?

855
00:52:30,360 --> 00:52:34,000
We actually did get a Rob mail, but I've already covered it, because I had

856
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:36,600
pulled that up from one of the sites that I review already.

857
00:52:36,600 --> 00:52:38,060
About, um...

858
00:52:38,060 --> 00:52:40,960
Actually, no, I haven't done it yet. It's an article I'd already pulled up. Sorry.

859
00:52:40,960 --> 00:52:42,200
Oh, but you were gonna cover it.

860
00:52:42,200 --> 00:52:42,960
I was gonna cover it.

861
00:52:42,960 --> 00:52:44,300
Oh, shit. Go for it. Why not?

862
00:52:44,300 --> 00:52:50,160
About Ubisoft, um, working with, uh, Taito to release, uh, Exit for the, uh,

863
00:52:50,160 --> 00:52:51,860
for the PSP.

864
00:52:51,860 --> 00:52:58,900
And it's a puzzle action game, looks like Oddworld 2, but I got my news from a different

865
00:52:58,900 --> 00:53:02,540
source than what he linked to me.

866
00:53:02,540 --> 00:53:08,500
Just to give a little background for this story, players control an escapologist called

867
00:53:08,500 --> 00:53:14,620
Mr. ESC, like your escape button, and must guide him around obstacles while rescuing

868
00:53:14,620 --> 00:53:15,620
people.

869
00:53:15,620 --> 00:53:19,220
You know, you have fires, earthquakes, stuff like that.

870
00:53:19,220 --> 00:53:23,340
A hundred different scenarios, downloadable content also made available.

871
00:53:23,340 --> 00:53:28,720
EXIT's also going along just for our European listeners.

872
00:53:28,720 --> 00:53:33,480
It's going to be, they're saying that it's going to fit in very well with some

873
00:53:33,480 --> 00:53:41,120
of the games being released like Frantics and Grip Shift, which is a puzzle driving game.

874
00:53:41,280 --> 00:53:48,060
Cool. Just a couple other of the emails received as soon as I pulled them up.

875
00:53:48,060 --> 00:53:53,060
one of our new listeners, Mason, who I think has just the most awesome email ever, I'm

876
00:53:53,060 --> 00:54:01,060
not going to give it out, but yeah, I like donuts too, um, so he, um, uh, imported Guitar

877
00:54:01,060 --> 00:54:06,740
Freaks controller and a copy of Guitar Freaks 4th Mix Good Game, his controller broke, honestly,

878
00:54:06,740 --> 00:54:11,620
third party controllers, never buy them, hello, get the Konami controller, sorry.

879
00:54:11,620 --> 00:54:13,900
You know what's really interesting, you know, if you want to go into history, is that who

880
00:54:13,900 --> 00:54:17,780
is making most of the third party controllers for Guitar Freaks? Red Octane, what's their

881
00:54:17,780 --> 00:54:21,300
bread and butter now. Guitar Hero, you think they're still making those third party controllers?

882
00:54:21,300 --> 00:54:25,380
Oh hell no. Don't think so. But instead on here, when I heard about Guitar Hero I was

883
00:54:25,380 --> 00:54:28,660
kind of hesitant. I wasn't sure if I should get it, will the controller break just as

884
00:54:28,660 --> 00:54:34,260
easily as my third party Guitar Freaks controller? Nope. No, that thing is freaking sturdy. I

885
00:54:34,260 --> 00:54:39,940
could probably bang it on a speaker, you know, I'll go rock out or something and it not tear

886
00:54:39,940 --> 00:54:43,160
up. Not that I would seriously want to do that. Here's the determining factor, do you

887
00:54:43,160 --> 00:54:47,300
want Guitar Hero or do you want Guitar Freaks? Do you want American rock or do you want the,

888
00:54:47,300 --> 00:54:51,300
you know, otaku, j-pop, co-op, you know, all that stuff.

889
00:54:51,300 --> 00:54:53,300
It's midi versus real guitar.

890
00:54:53,300 --> 00:54:57,300
Well, that too, but you know, do you want j-pop, do you want American rock?

891
00:54:57,300 --> 00:54:59,300
Because the song lists are vastly different between the two.

892
00:54:59,300 --> 00:55:02,300
Guitar Hero is worth the money that you'll spend on it.

893
00:55:02,300 --> 00:55:05,300
On top of that, if you're going to play Guitar Freaks,

894
00:55:05,300 --> 00:55:11,300
I know of sites I will tell you, you know, via email where I do my ordering from

895
00:55:11,300 --> 00:55:14,300
because I don't want to, unless they want to pay us.

896
00:55:14,300 --> 00:55:19,700
But I ordered both of my controllers for very reasonable, although they're a lot harder

897
00:55:19,700 --> 00:55:20,700
to get now.

898
00:55:20,700 --> 00:55:21,700
And Guitar Hero has freeze pop!

899
00:55:21,700 --> 00:55:22,700
Freeze pop!

900
00:55:22,700 --> 00:55:23,700
Yes, they have freeze pop!

901
00:55:23,700 --> 00:55:28,260
And also, it's kind of funny if you can go back and watch them making of movies, they're

902
00:55:28,260 --> 00:55:29,260
really fun.

903
00:55:29,260 --> 00:55:30,260
Any other emails?

904
00:55:30,260 --> 00:55:31,260
Uh, yes.

905
00:55:31,260 --> 00:55:43,380
yes Rodney says Roddycat has sent us an email saying about how Sega

906
00:55:43,380 --> 00:55:48,780
mentioning that to our Sega making a classic game story and he's thinking

907
00:55:48,780 --> 00:55:57,020
it's Alex Kidd. I was like well it's not quite run and gun. It's a

908
00:55:57,020 --> 00:56:03,580
franchise that I think should be revived yeah I actually my favorite ever game

909
00:56:03,580 --> 00:56:09,040
for the master system next to of course fantasy zone because I'm a big fantasy

910
00:56:09,040 --> 00:56:14,500
zone whore space here well yeah space Harrier but I mean like for that we're

911
00:56:14,500 --> 00:56:20,140
just me I really love Alex Kidd and shinobi world that's just fun for me

912
00:56:20,140 --> 00:56:26,060
this was more a Genesis thing but it's got to be altered beast rise from your

913
00:56:26,060 --> 00:56:36,280
grave anyway yeah and also we got a kudos from our Mac man for reading his

914
00:56:36,280 --> 00:56:43,040
last letter on here and so I'm going to say hi again Mac man so if you want to

918
00:57:03,900 --> 00:57:10,300
porn on the other computer now for minutes on end I'm looking at info okay

919
00:57:10,300 --> 00:57:15,820
about about porn about porn about porn however though there is a game coming up

920
00:57:15,820 --> 00:57:20,580
that I really do want to check out this is coming out for our European audience

921
00:57:20,580 --> 00:57:28,680
experience, which was actually already released before as a simple 2000 series, volume 50,

922
00:57:28,680 --> 00:57:34,200
the Dibogyn, which is going to be re-released as Demolition Girl. It's a game where you

923
00:57:34,200 --> 00:57:39,680
fly around in a helicopter and you attack 50-foot women. I don't know, it just appeals

924
00:57:39,680 --> 00:57:40,880
to me in some way.

925
00:57:40,880 --> 00:57:45,240
Loki, Loki, mailbag, mailbag time. Your time later, mailbag time.

926
00:57:45,240 --> 00:57:46,240
Actually I'm done.

927
00:57:46,240 --> 00:57:49,980
Oh, okay, never mind. Anything else then about the Demolition Girl? Does it have Daryl Hannah

928
00:57:49,980 --> 00:57:54,980
in it. It does not have Daryl Hannah in it, but it's actually being released in Europe

929
00:57:54,980 --> 00:57:59,580
as a budget title, which is very interesting. Definitely need to check it out, among other

930
00:57:59,580 --> 00:58:02,900
games, like Kingdom Hearts 2, which I'll be playing probably this week.

931
00:58:02,900 --> 00:58:11,900
Oh, Kingdom Hearts 2! I watched the ending because I'm bad. I am so awful. And the ending

932
00:58:11,900 --> 00:58:16,100
leaves me with many more questions than anything else I've seen on the internet.

933
00:58:16,100 --> 00:58:19,320
So in other words, it's inevitable there's going to be a Kingdom Hearts 3?

934
00:58:19,320 --> 00:58:23,800
I don't know, actually, but Jamie needs this game now.

935
00:58:23,800 --> 00:58:29,580
I'm freaking tempted to import it, except I can't read Japanese very well.

936
00:58:29,580 --> 00:58:33,360
This is a good plug for our live station, which runs music from games 24 hours a day,

937
00:58:33,360 --> 00:58:36,860
7 days a week, at OrangeHonserator.com, because we just put in Rotation this week, the theme

938
00:58:36,860 --> 00:58:38,280
from Kingdom Hearts II.

939
00:58:38,280 --> 00:58:40,040
It's Utada Hikaru with Passion.

940
00:58:40,040 --> 00:58:50,040
Of course, I picked like the worst clip from- let's try another clip, here we go.

941
00:58:50,040 --> 00:58:56,920
Anyway, check that out over at orangeletcherd.com, that's in rotation now, so.

942
00:58:56,920 --> 00:59:00,680
I need that for one particular level, actually.

943
00:59:00,680 --> 00:59:01,680
Freakin' Tron.

944
00:59:01,680 --> 00:59:03,680
Freakin' Tron, I know, that'd be awesome.

945
00:59:03,680 --> 00:59:04,680
What?

946
00:59:04,680 --> 00:59:06,160
They put a Chicken Little level in there.

947
00:59:06,160 --> 00:59:09,200
No, Chicken Little is not in there, he's a summon.

948
00:59:09,200 --> 00:59:14,200
I saw that Zach Braff was doing the voice in the American version because they released the voice.

949
00:59:14,200 --> 00:59:18,200
That list is the one off of IMDB and it is not correct.

950
00:59:18,200 --> 00:59:21,200
Really? Oh.

951
00:59:21,200 --> 00:59:28,200
Do not trust anything that IMDB puts out as far as voice acting goes until the official list comes out.

952
00:59:28,200 --> 00:59:31,200
That's because IMDB is user-powered, right?

953
00:59:31,200 --> 00:59:33,200
Exactly.

954
00:59:33,200 --> 00:59:36,200
All they did was port over the actors who played them.

955
00:59:36,200 --> 00:59:41,200
However, I do have a strong feeling that they are going to get Johnny Depp.

956
00:59:41,200 --> 00:59:43,200
Well, we'll see.

957
00:59:43,200 --> 00:59:48,200
And, and, and, and, there's also Steamboat Willy Lovell and it's so cute!

958
00:59:48,200 --> 00:59:53,200
Alright, let's go over to Loki who has a couple more stories for us about, well just clear

959
00:59:53,200 --> 00:59:54,880
us out whatever stories you got over there, Loki.

960
00:59:54,880 --> 00:59:59,840
Okay, real quick, there was actually some really nice Christmas gifts that a few Game

961
00:59:59,840 --> 01:00:05,100
of Publishers have been putting out, these being in the form of new downloads for some

962
01:00:05,100 --> 01:00:08,500
games actually out there right now. The first one starting off with the

963
01:00:08,500 --> 01:00:11,860
Xbox is they've actually got some map packs coming out

964
01:00:11,860 --> 01:00:16,120
for Star Wars Battlefront 2 and you can get those

965
01:00:16,120 --> 01:00:19,940
actually available on Xbox Live and they're available

966
01:00:19,940 --> 01:00:24,260
they're going to be having another January pack coming out

967
01:00:24,260 --> 01:00:28,340
about five bucks featuring some more maps in there as well which is pretty

968
01:00:28,340 --> 01:00:29,060
cool.

969
01:00:29,060 --> 01:00:33,020
The other map pack that's coming out is actually for the PC

970
01:00:33,020 --> 01:00:37,340
and it's going to be for Quake 4 and you've got three free maps that you can actually

971
01:00:37,340 --> 01:00:42,760
download on the official website idsoftware.com so definitely check those out if you play

972
01:00:42,760 --> 01:00:44,420
some Quake 4.

973
01:00:44,420 --> 01:00:50,720
And then finally there was actually some for, oh no wait actually that was it.

974
01:00:50,720 --> 01:00:52,660
My mistake I had two of the same story on there.

975
01:00:52,660 --> 01:00:57,940
Well I thought you had a story about Wal-Mart and stockpiling 360's or something.

976
01:00:57,940 --> 01:01:02,460
Yes, Wal-Mart is pulling a Best Buy basically and they're going to be doing a sale for New

977
01:01:02,460 --> 01:01:08,700
years and they're stock probably in 360s supposedly. So definitely if you haven't got a 360 yet

978
01:01:08,700 --> 01:01:11,940
still interested in getting one, go check out your Walmart on New Year's Day.

979
01:01:11,940 --> 01:01:17,300
I've been hearing rumors that, and I can't say what my source is or where I got it from,

980
01:01:17,300 --> 01:01:23,300
but some of the game vendors are hoping to have their pre-orders filled by actually mid

981
01:01:23,300 --> 01:01:24,300
to end January.

982
01:01:24,300 --> 01:01:30,140
That's good news for a lot of people. Let's hope it's true. Anything else, Loki?

983
01:01:30,140 --> 01:01:35,340
I was just going to mention kind of in the homebrew since, um, senile team, um, the people

984
01:01:35,340 --> 01:01:41,500
behind this kind of a, what was it, a Streets of Rage PC game called Beats of Rage that

985
01:01:41,500 --> 01:01:45,820
you might have also covered it before when it was on the PSP, they did a port of it.

986
01:01:45,820 --> 01:01:50,980
Uh, they have a new game coming out called Age of Beasts, um, which looks like an updated

987
01:01:50,980 --> 01:01:56,500
version of, um, Streets of Rage but, um, they've done it in more of kind of the Altered Beast

988
01:01:56,500 --> 01:01:57,500
type thing.

989
01:01:57,500 --> 01:02:02,740
Should be really cool. I'm actually kind of looking forward to play around with it some more because you can do some shooter type stuff

990
01:02:02,740 --> 01:02:08,460
And I'm a pretty good game. Definitely check them out at senileteam.segaforums.com

991
01:02:09,060 --> 01:02:13,780
All right, and finally tonight boys and girls. I hope this didn't happen to you, but

992
01:02:14,740 --> 01:02:21,540
World of Warcraft call or pulled what I would call a Ragnarok online this week when they said we ban you

993
01:02:22,140 --> 01:02:24,140
We ban you to

994
01:02:24,820 --> 01:02:26,820
18,000 accounts

995
01:02:26,820 --> 01:02:29,320
Cancelled! Why were they cancelled?

996
01:02:29,820 --> 01:02:33,320
Third party programs to farm gold and items.

997
01:02:33,820 --> 01:02:36,820
Stop effing up the economy, you're banned.

998
01:02:37,320 --> 01:02:39,820
I actually got my account cancelled.

999
01:02:40,320 --> 01:02:42,320
You weren't one of these 18,000, were you?

1000
01:02:42,320 --> 01:02:44,820
No, they rejected my ATM card because I got a new one.

1001
01:02:45,320 --> 01:02:47,320
That's not nearly as interesting.

1002
01:02:47,820 --> 01:02:50,320
I don't care if it's about you, that's not interesting. Alright.

1003
01:02:51,820 --> 01:02:54,820
Of course if it's about me it's interesting. I'm a show diva.

1004
01:02:54,820 --> 01:02:58,380
We're going to go around now and give everybody's final thought because we're about to wrap

1005
01:02:58,380 --> 01:02:59,380
it up.

1006
01:02:59,380 --> 01:03:01,780
We do have one more note for you guys, but first the final thoughts.

1007
01:03:01,780 --> 01:03:03,660
Loki, your final thought.

1008
01:03:03,660 --> 01:03:08,940
My final thought is I've got to get to planes of these games that I have on cue to basically

1009
01:03:08,940 --> 01:03:13,540
play Kingdom Hearts 2, of course, because I have a walkthrough because I can't read

1010
01:03:13,540 --> 01:03:14,540
Japanese.

1011
01:03:14,540 --> 01:03:15,540
Alright.

1012
01:03:15,540 --> 01:03:20,140
My final thought would be January 1st on our live show, we're making a huge announcement

1013
01:03:20,140 --> 01:03:22,180
about the future of Orange Lounge Radio.

1014
01:03:22,180 --> 01:03:24,840
It will change everything.

1015
01:03:24,840 --> 01:03:26,160
It's going to be good.

1016
01:03:26,160 --> 01:03:27,160
Check it out.

1017
01:03:27,160 --> 01:03:31,400
Of course, if you miss that, we will say it on the podcast as well.

1018
01:03:31,400 --> 01:03:34,480
And we're getting drunk?

1019
01:03:34,480 --> 01:03:39,540
Well, yeah, that'll be interesting nonetheless.

1020
01:03:39,540 --> 01:03:50,000
And of course, that will air at 2 a.m. London time the next day.

1021
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:51,520
Big announcement January 1st.

1022
01:03:51,520 --> 01:03:53,800
DarkSakura, your final thought?

1023
01:03:53,800 --> 01:03:56,620
Reject false icons and number two,

1024
01:03:56,620 --> 01:03:59,020
remember, don't shoot the food.

1025
01:03:59,020 --> 01:04:01,520
Now, of course, we have one other little footnote

1026
01:04:01,520 --> 01:04:03,740
because, you know, it is the holiday season

1027
01:04:03,740 --> 01:04:06,340
and it's, you know, we're still spreading the cheer.

1028
01:04:06,340 --> 01:04:07,780
Even if Christmas is over, there's still,

1029
01:04:07,780 --> 01:04:10,300
you know, Hanukkah, Kwanzaa, a bunch of holidays.

1030
01:04:10,300 --> 01:04:13,020
My brother told me happy Kwanzaa today.

1031
01:04:13,020 --> 01:04:15,640
Because you're so, you know, Kwanzaa's celebrating.

1032
01:04:15,640 --> 01:04:16,480
Anyway.

1033
01:04:16,480 --> 01:04:26,600
Anyway, we thought this was really cool, actually another podcast did this and they sent us

1034
01:04:26,600 --> 01:04:30,240
an email saying happy holidays and we thought you'd want to share this with your listeners

1035
01:04:30,240 --> 01:04:33,640
and I thought, you know what, this was so well produced and this was cute.

1036
01:04:33,640 --> 01:04:37,080
I know that's probably a really bad word to describe something that a bunch of guys put

1037
01:04:37,080 --> 01:04:38,680
together is that it's cute.

1038
01:04:38,680 --> 01:04:39,680
That's adorable.

1039
01:04:39,680 --> 01:04:41,700
But it's a neat song, it's cool.

1040
01:04:41,700 --> 01:04:46,300
These guys over at DreamStationCC is their website, dreamstation.cc.

1041
01:04:46,300 --> 01:04:49,340
The folks on the DreamStation video game show actually put this little happy holiday song

1042
01:04:49,340 --> 01:04:53,140
together and it's kind of funny because they talk about noobs getting pwned in it, which

1043
01:04:53,140 --> 01:04:56,400
is, you know, if you speak elite, that's pretty funny.

1044
01:04:56,400 --> 01:05:00,340
So we thought we'd play it for you guys here, so if you want to hear more crazy antics from

1045
01:05:00,340 --> 01:05:08,260
these guys, head on over to www.dreamstation.cc and remember kids, support independent podcasts.

1046
01:05:08,260 --> 01:05:12,900
we're closing with this so have a great week we'll see you next time

1047
01:05:38,260 --> 01:05:39,260
to click your heels

1048
01:05:39,260 --> 01:05:41,020
Riding this road as you hear it squeal

1049
01:05:41,020 --> 01:05:42,700
The town seems full of lardies

1050
01:05:42,700 --> 01:05:44,540
and lights you'll never know

1051
01:05:44,540 --> 01:05:46,300
It's Christmas at DreamStation

1052
01:05:46,300 --> 01:05:48,300
where all the news gets honed

1053
01:05:55,420 --> 01:05:57,300
The Net Cafe is where I play

1054
01:05:57,300 --> 01:05:59,140
A ticket to gaming, I spend my day

1055
01:05:59,140 --> 01:06:00,820
It's Christmas in Korea

1056
01:06:00,820 --> 01:06:02,820
I haven't had food for days

1057
01:06:02,820 --> 01:06:04,660
XBox knows it's only slow

1058
01:06:04,660 --> 01:06:06,340
For Nintendo has nothing to show

1059
01:06:06,340 --> 01:06:08,180
The PC's slowly dying

1060
01:06:08,180 --> 01:06:09,940
except for the MMO.

1061
01:06:09,940 --> 01:06:13,620
The ducks are playing Madden, the chicks are playing WoW,

1062
01:06:13,620 --> 01:06:17,300
the PC dudes are fragging noobs, the noobs are wondering how.

1063
01:06:17,300 --> 01:06:20,860
Carve the ham and damn the man, alienate every one of our fans

1064
01:06:20,860 --> 01:06:24,500
from Canada to Africa in places we've never owned.

1065
01:06:24,500 --> 01:06:29,540
It's Christmas at the station where all the noobs get owned.

1066
01:06:29,540 --> 01:06:31,420
And just one final footnote, don't

1067
01:06:31,420 --> 01:06:34,620
expect us to sing ever, ever.

1068
01:06:34,620 --> 01:06:38,620
Hey, I think that we should end this show on a high note.

1069
01:06:38,620 --> 01:06:40,060
What?

1070
01:06:40,060 --> 01:06:41,740
Except I can't sing that.

1071
01:06:41,740 --> 01:06:44,540
We already know how the whole singing thing

1072
01:06:44,540 --> 01:06:45,920
went down.

1073
01:06:45,920 --> 01:06:50,220
No, I forgot, put a copy of Karaoke Revolution over it. No, no, no, we should probably...

1074
01:06:50,220 --> 01:06:54,300
I think when we do our little outtakes DVD,

1075
01:06:54,300 --> 01:06:57,420
we need to put I'm Stayin' In on it.

1076
01:06:57,420 --> 01:06:59,160
Alright.

1077
01:06:59,160 --> 01:07:03,500
Longest show ever, good job guys. Happy holidays, this is our gift.

1078
01:07:03,500 --> 01:07:16,740
See you next time!
