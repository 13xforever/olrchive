4
00:00:19,793 --> 00:00:21,773
[SPEAKER_03]: Ho, ho, ho, everybody.

5
00:00:23,093 --> 00:00:24,914
[SPEAKER_04]: Welcome to Orange Lounge Radio To Go.

6
00:00:25,734 --> 00:00:26,694
[SPEAKER_04]: Hope you had a great holiday.

7
00:00:27,878 --> 00:00:28,338
[SPEAKER_04]: Choke, choke, gasp

8
00:00:52,990 --> 00:00:55,332
[SPEAKER_04]: What, did you get coal in your stocking this year again?

9
00:00:55,652 --> 00:00:57,073
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, I did get coal in my stocking.

10
00:00:57,153 --> 00:00:57,573
[SPEAKER_04]: Awesome.

11
00:00:57,913 --> 00:00:59,314
[SPEAKER_00]: That was from me.

12
00:00:59,374 --> 00:01:00,475
[SPEAKER_00]: No, actually, it was from Dan.

13
00:01:00,955 --> 00:01:04,137
[SPEAKER_00]: It was in a little tin box that said lump of coal, and it did have a lump of coal in it.

14
00:01:05,538 --> 00:01:06,359
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that all he got you?

15
00:01:06,579 --> 00:01:10,822
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I got the most romantic gift of Dawn of the Dead.

16
00:01:11,282 --> 00:01:11,622
[SPEAKER_00]: Cool.

17
00:01:12,323 --> 00:01:16,866
[SPEAKER_00]: And Serenity, of course, and a $500 car stereo and speakers.

18
00:01:17,086 --> 00:01:17,506
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.

19
00:01:18,547 --> 00:01:18,967
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice.

20
00:01:19,047 --> 00:01:20,188
[SPEAKER_04]: What did Dan get me for Christmas?

21
00:01:21,029 --> 00:01:21,649
[SPEAKER_00]: A kick in the butt.

22
00:01:22,077 --> 00:01:22,717
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

23
00:01:22,777 --> 00:01:24,518
[SPEAKER_04]: Over there in the corner is the one and only Loki.

24
00:01:25,378 --> 00:01:25,698
[SPEAKER_04]: Hello.

25
00:01:26,098 --> 00:01:26,578
[SPEAKER_04]: How you doing?

26
00:01:27,019 --> 00:01:27,579
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm okay.

27
00:01:27,819 --> 00:01:28,119
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

28
00:01:29,079 --> 00:01:32,580
[SPEAKER_04]: What'd you do for the Christmas day or holiday or whatever?

29
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:33,581
[SPEAKER_02]: I hung out with family.

30
00:01:33,681 --> 00:01:35,381
[SPEAKER_02]: That's pretty much it, yeah.

31
00:01:35,541 --> 00:01:36,221
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you get anything?

32
00:01:36,261 --> 00:01:36,762
[SPEAKER_04]: Get some loot?

33
00:01:36,882 --> 00:01:37,962
[SPEAKER_02]: I got salami.

34
00:01:40,063 --> 00:01:41,503
[SPEAKER_00]: What an awesome present!

35
00:01:41,583 --> 00:01:42,903
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think that's a game.

36
00:01:42,943 --> 00:01:44,404
[SPEAKER_04]: I haven't heard of salami.

37
00:01:44,961 --> 00:01:45,462
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for watching!

38
00:02:03,223 --> 00:02:05,484
[SPEAKER_04]: Help the Swiss Miss, save her supply of beef sticks.

39
00:02:05,504 --> 00:02:15,449
[SPEAKER_02]: No one gets me games for Christmas because they know that I, for one, I do work at a company that sells games, and I get tons of games anyways, and then I buy whatever I want.

40
00:02:16,309 --> 00:02:17,450
[SPEAKER_02]: Good point.

41
00:02:17,510 --> 00:02:18,070
[SPEAKER_02]: It makes it tough.

42
00:02:18,611 --> 00:02:19,371
[SPEAKER_04]: Good point, good point.

43
00:02:20,069 --> 00:02:24,031
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, well, of course, happy holidays from us here at Orange Lounge Radio to you guys.

44
00:02:24,271 --> 00:02:26,713
[SPEAKER_04]: And we are a day late this week because of the holidays.

45
00:02:26,753 --> 00:02:27,553
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, give us a break.

46
00:02:27,913 --> 00:02:29,654
[SPEAKER_04]: We're entitled to a vacation every once in a while.

47
00:02:30,155 --> 00:02:32,216
[SPEAKER_04]: But we're here doing the show for you guys tonight.

48
00:02:32,336 --> 00:02:33,516
[SPEAKER_00]: I was actually playing a game.

49
00:02:34,937 --> 00:02:37,459
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, what a good segue into how was your gaming week?

50
00:02:37,899 --> 00:02:38,779
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, what did you play?

51
00:02:38,919 --> 00:02:39,880
[SPEAKER_04]: Trivial Pursuits.

52
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:42,961
[SPEAKER_04]: Was that on a console?

53
00:02:42,981 --> 00:02:50,945
[SPEAKER_00]: No, we did Couples Trivial Pursuits, me and Dan and his cousins and significant others and wives and things.

54
00:02:50,985 --> 00:02:52,486
[SPEAKER_04]: This is not a board game podcast.

55
00:02:52,506 --> 00:02:56,128
[SPEAKER_04]: There are some board game podcasts out there, of which we are not one.

56
00:02:56,428 --> 00:02:58,990
[SPEAKER_04]: So what kind of console or computer games were you playing?

57
00:02:59,070 --> 00:03:05,093
[SPEAKER_00]: I started Papa Lacrosse, then Dan took the PSP away from me, which I was very upset with.

58
00:03:06,738 --> 00:03:11,460
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I found my game sitting on my computer desk and the PSP was gone.

59
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:13,001
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, well, great.

60
00:03:13,701 --> 00:03:15,262
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've been playing a lot of Animal Crossing.

61
00:03:16,282 --> 00:03:16,723
[SPEAKER_04]: Very cool.

62
00:03:18,623 --> 00:03:21,105
[SPEAKER_00]: And I finally got to see Need for Speed Underground on...

63
00:03:22,773 --> 00:03:24,454
[SPEAKER_00]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

64
00:03:53,222 --> 00:03:55,363
[SPEAKER_00]: Just the cop chases were awesome on it.

65
00:03:56,803 --> 00:03:57,143
[SPEAKER_04]: That's it?

66
00:03:59,144 --> 00:03:59,784
[SPEAKER_00]: For now.

67
00:04:00,104 --> 00:04:02,425
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, well, meow, Miss Thing, alright.

68
00:04:04,546 --> 00:04:07,006
[SPEAKER_04]: Somebody woke up on the wrong side of the sleigh, what's going on?

69
00:04:07,707 --> 00:04:08,747
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe under the sleigh.

70
00:04:08,867 --> 00:04:11,768
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, uh, Loki, how was your gaming week?

71
00:04:12,168 --> 00:04:15,989
[SPEAKER_02]: I just played a lot of multiplayer games, you know, typical work stuff.

72
00:04:16,369 --> 00:04:20,511
[SPEAKER_02]: Grand Theft Auto Liberty's safe story is that we actually have our six-man teams now, so...

73
00:04:22,630 --> 00:04:24,532
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really dense.

74
00:04:24,652 --> 00:04:27,213
[SPEAKER_02]: There's tons of people running around in that game, which is fun.

75
00:04:27,554 --> 00:04:29,995
[SPEAKER_02]: And it makes it really challenging.

76
00:04:30,676 --> 00:04:33,278
[SPEAKER_02]: But, I don't know.

77
00:04:33,338 --> 00:04:34,358
[SPEAKER_02]: Other people are getting better now.

78
00:04:34,638 --> 00:04:37,020
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's giving me more of a challenge, which is good.

79
00:04:37,340 --> 00:04:41,523
[SPEAKER_02]: And then Call of Duty 2, we've been playing multiplayer during lunch, which is really cool.

80
00:04:41,883 --> 00:04:45,266
[SPEAKER_02]: And I actually need to play the single player version of the game because it would be really nice.

81
00:04:45,686 --> 00:04:51,410
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, of course, Animal Crossing Wild World, we've been playing almost every day now.

82
00:04:52,922 --> 00:04:56,344
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know, it's a real easy game to pick up, play for like 10 minutes and put down.

83
00:04:56,924 --> 00:04:58,125
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's why I kind of like it.

84
00:04:58,805 --> 00:05:02,086
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't have to play it every day like friggin' Nintendogs.

85
00:05:02,626 --> 00:05:06,808
[SPEAKER_02]: Which I might add, I haven't played in a long time thinking about selling my last copy too.

86
00:05:06,828 --> 00:05:07,949
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh wow.

87
00:05:09,229 --> 00:05:12,991
[SPEAKER_00]: My puppies are probably flea ridden and rabid by now.

88
00:05:13,747 --> 00:05:17,430
[SPEAKER_04]: I was worried that Animal Crossing was going to turn out the same way as Nintendogs.

89
00:05:17,510 --> 00:05:20,072
[SPEAKER_04]: Now that the game's been out for a little while, what do you think?

90
00:05:20,292 --> 00:05:22,794
[SPEAKER_04]: Is this something you're going to still be playing six months from now?

91
00:05:24,295 --> 00:05:28,998
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure I'll get tired of it after a while, because six months, there's a lot of good games that are going to come out between then.

92
00:05:29,499 --> 00:05:33,922
[SPEAKER_02]: But it is going to be a game that I'll be playing for at least another couple months, for sure.

93
00:05:36,187 --> 00:05:39,948
[SPEAKER_00]: I know, I played the GameCube one all year just to get all the stuff.

94
00:05:40,068 --> 00:05:41,728
[SPEAKER_00]: Except I don't know that holidays are in this one.

95
00:05:42,128 --> 00:05:43,689
[SPEAKER_00]: Because the Japanese version didn't have holidays.

96
00:05:44,549 --> 00:05:45,949
[SPEAKER_04]: There's different holidays.

97
00:05:45,989 --> 00:05:48,310
[SPEAKER_04]: There's politically correct holidays.

98
00:05:49,250 --> 00:05:49,850
[SPEAKER_00]: So retarded.

99
00:05:49,870 --> 00:05:55,592
[SPEAKER_02]: I love the festive candle that was in there, which is the menorah and the festive tree, you know, Christmas tree.

100
00:05:58,152 --> 00:06:00,153
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, it was...

101
00:06:01,926 --> 00:06:09,169
[SPEAKER_00]: Nevermind, Foamy the Squirrel said it all for me, so I'll just let... I'll direct people to the recent Foamy the Squirrel Christmas thing.

102
00:06:09,509 --> 00:06:11,330
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's how I feel about it.

103
00:06:11,770 --> 00:06:12,790
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, check it out.

104
00:06:14,131 --> 00:06:14,431
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that it?

105
00:06:14,671 --> 00:06:15,572
[SPEAKER_04]: Anything else you want to add, Loki?

106
00:06:15,672 --> 00:06:17,012
[SPEAKER_04]: That's pretty much it, yeah.

107
00:06:17,092 --> 00:06:28,537
[SPEAKER_04]: My gaming week was pretty uneventful, honestly, because I didn't really get a whole lot of new stuff, so I've been basically, as promised last week, Final Fantasy IV Advance has been taking up a lot of my time.

108
00:06:29,898 --> 00:06:30,038
[SPEAKER_04]: And...

109
00:06:31,425 --> 00:06:34,526
[SPEAKER_04]: I also was playing Animal Crossing for a little bit and checking out some other stuff.

110
00:06:34,566 --> 00:06:39,448
[SPEAKER_04]: So I decided I wanted to get into something new but there wasn't a whole lot of new games that were out that I wanted.

111
00:06:40,028 --> 00:06:46,410
[SPEAKER_04]: So I've been seeing commercials on TV and looking around the internet lately and I've heard a lot about this service GameTap.

112
00:06:46,830 --> 00:06:48,231
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if you guys out there have heard of this.

113
00:06:48,291 --> 00:06:54,573
[SPEAKER_04]: GameTap is this thing where you can like play I think something like 300 games is what they boast in their category.

114
00:06:54,973 --> 00:06:55,893
[SPEAKER_04]: 300 games on demand.

115
00:06:55,953 --> 00:06:57,514
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like an on demand gaming service.

116
00:06:58,114 --> 00:07:00,395
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a very interesting business model because it's

117
00:07:01,095 --> 00:07:11,741
[SPEAKER_04]: Setup basically so that you pay a monthly service fee, which is right now I think they're running a special where it's a two-week free trial and a $9.95 a month for 12 months.

118
00:07:12,641 --> 00:07:17,664
[SPEAKER_04]: But I think normally it's about $14.95 a month is what they charge, so I'm not sure how long their special's running for.

119
00:07:18,504 --> 00:07:26,088
[SPEAKER_04]: But what I think is interesting is that they say, hey, this is how much you'd pay for WoW or other comparable MMOs, so I thought that was kind of an interesting way to plug it.

120
00:07:27,149 --> 00:07:30,631
[SPEAKER_04]: But of course the games that are accessible in the library are older games, but

121
00:07:31,428 --> 00:07:31,888
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

122
00:07:50,350 --> 00:07:51,992
[SPEAKER_04]: Namco Games are actually in the GameTap.

123
00:07:52,032 --> 00:08:02,201
[SPEAKER_04]: GameTap has contracts or some type of agreement with many game publishing companies such as I noticed Sega, Activision, Sierra, and Namco.

124
00:08:02,702 --> 00:08:08,707
[SPEAKER_04]: Not that all the games from these companies are in the library, but a few of their notable ones like Pac-Man's in the library, Dig Dugs, those type of things.

125
00:08:10,347 --> 00:08:19,857
[SPEAKER_04]: But what's interesting also, not every game, you know, Nintendo, you're not going to see anything by Nintendo in here, but the GameTab library has all these different areas.

126
00:08:19,877 --> 00:08:24,242
[SPEAKER_04]: You can either sort it by genre, you can sort it by the system, which I thought was very interesting.

127
00:08:24,302 --> 00:08:27,826
[SPEAKER_04]: I did not realize when I first downloaded it that they actually had Dreamcast games in there.

128
00:08:28,226 --> 00:08:29,186
[SPEAKER_04]: There's not very many.

129
00:08:29,206 --> 00:08:31,027
[SPEAKER_04]: There's only three Dreamcast games available.

130
00:08:31,267 --> 00:08:33,407
[SPEAKER_04]: I remember Hydro Thunder, Mr. Driller are both in there.

131
00:08:34,128 --> 00:08:40,669
[SPEAKER_04]: But I thought it was very interesting that, you know, Dreamcast isn't that old, all things considered, so it was kind of neat to see that in there.

132
00:08:41,249 --> 00:08:44,150
[SPEAKER_04]: And they also have some relatively recent PC games in there, some of the Tomb Raider games.

133
00:08:45,390 --> 00:08:47,171
[SPEAKER_04]: Oops, sorry, my mic's going in now.

134
00:08:47,631 --> 00:08:51,472
[SPEAKER_04]: Some of the Tomb Raider games, Tom Clancy games are in there.

135
00:08:53,885 --> 00:08:54,506
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

136
00:09:18,218 --> 00:09:20,379
[SPEAKER_04]: And in a way, like, okay, think about iTunes.

137
00:09:20,439 --> 00:09:21,159
[SPEAKER_04]: What does it allow you to do?

138
00:09:21,199 --> 00:09:23,520
[SPEAKER_04]: It allows you to download music legally, right?

139
00:09:23,660 --> 00:09:30,603
[SPEAKER_04]: But a lot of people just download their music from, what are the services out there now?

140
00:09:30,803 --> 00:09:34,604
[SPEAKER_04]: With a closed WinMX, they got what, what's the underground stuff out there?

141
00:09:34,644 --> 00:09:38,486
[SPEAKER_04]: BitTorrent, or, you know, you could download songs off of there, but

142
00:09:39,133 --> 00:09:39,654
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura,

143
00:09:50,558 --> 00:09:55,181
[SPEAKER_04]: What's interesting about GameTap is it's almost like that, but now we're talking about like abandonware and emulation.

144
00:09:55,762 --> 00:10:02,386
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think this is the first time, and I would say it's kind of taken the industry long enough, with the exception of these retro packs and things.

145
00:10:02,406 --> 00:10:17,656
[SPEAKER_04]: This is really the first time that I can recall seeing like a PC kind of trying to legalize the abandonware and emulation scene, which could be bad news for those people because as this gets more and more prevalent, you know, I think they're going to go after those types of sites, the ones that they haven't already.

146
00:10:18,257 --> 00:10:18,617
[SPEAKER_04]: But you know,

147
00:10:19,781 --> 00:10:20,403
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

148
00:10:27,156 --> 00:10:29,617
[SPEAKER_04]: So interface is very sleek.

149
00:10:29,757 --> 00:10:35,259
[SPEAKER_04]: Games download pretty quickly unless you're playing like a newer game that was originally on CD.

150
00:10:36,259 --> 00:10:38,620
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I played Mr. Driller on Dreamcast.

151
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:40,141
[SPEAKER_04]: It took like 11 minutes to download.

152
00:10:40,621 --> 00:10:42,902
[SPEAKER_04]: But you can play other games in the background.

153
00:10:42,922 --> 00:10:45,082
[SPEAKER_04]: Like while that's downloading, I can play something on Atari 2600.

154
00:10:45,142 --> 00:10:51,945
[SPEAKER_04]: And what I also thought was very interesting about GameTap, and this is something I don't think a lot of people are mentioning, is that

155
00:10:53,263 --> 00:10:57,785
[SPEAKER_04]: GameTap is owned by Turner Broadcasting, which owns a lot of television stations.

156
00:10:58,305 --> 00:11:02,227
[SPEAKER_04]: And so they produce their own programming for this GameTap service.

157
00:11:02,527 --> 00:11:06,748
[SPEAKER_04]: One of the things they push is this MediaPlex that has their own little channels.

158
00:11:06,768 --> 00:11:12,170
[SPEAKER_04]: They have a reality show to pick the next GJ, as they're calling it, like a game jockey or whatever.

159
00:11:12,711 --> 00:11:14,331
[SPEAKER_04]: Cheesy, but OK, whatever.

160
00:11:15,232 --> 00:11:20,134
[SPEAKER_04]: And then they also have these little commercials that play while you're waiting to download the games.

161
00:11:21,753 --> 00:11:28,577
[SPEAKER_04]: and they kind of show like, you know, like a Dig Dug short funny thing or Pac-Man or whatever.

162
00:11:28,597 --> 00:11:29,318
[SPEAKER_04]: What was the other one I saw?

163
00:11:29,338 --> 00:11:31,279
[SPEAKER_04]: Like Galaxian or there's other stuff in there.

164
00:11:31,779 --> 00:11:40,765
[SPEAKER_04]: So what I thought was kind of neat about that is that a lot of the stuff I was seeing on GameTap is probably better than anything I've seen on G4 TV the past year.

165
00:11:41,805 --> 00:11:45,427
[SPEAKER_04]: So that kind of makes me go, hmm, very interesting.

166
00:11:45,467 --> 00:11:49,490
[SPEAKER_04]: And you know, if there's anybody from GameTap out there listening by chance, seriously,

167
00:11:50,501 --> 00:11:53,263
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm pretty impressed with what you guys are doing programming-wise.

168
00:11:53,683 --> 00:11:55,884
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm like, why don't you guys start a station?

169
00:11:55,904 --> 00:12:13,354
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I don't know if you guys are aware right now, but gamers are pretty much being robbed very slowly of the only representation we pretty much had on TV, which was G4, which, you know, bought Tech TV and then now is, you know, replacing their shows like Filter and G4TV.com with repeats of The Man Show and repeats of Fastlane.

170
00:12:14,035 --> 00:12:17,437
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, people, no one watched Fastlane the first time for a reason, okay?

171
00:12:19,349 --> 00:12:21,910
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to know why they're showing Star Trek The Next Generation.

172
00:12:22,130 --> 00:12:23,530
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, and now that too.

173
00:12:23,630 --> 00:12:25,171
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like, WTF, people?

174
00:12:25,391 --> 00:12:28,712
[SPEAKER_04]: Star Trek The Next Generation, they've become Spike now?

175
00:12:28,812 --> 00:12:30,412
[SPEAKER_04]: They're Spike for kids is what they're turning into.

176
00:12:30,432 --> 00:12:31,532
[SPEAKER_04]: But anyway, this is about GameTap.

177
00:12:31,933 --> 00:12:39,095
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm pretty impressed because it seems like, you know what, the people at GameTap seem to know what they're doing, unlike the folks at G4.

178
00:12:39,495 --> 00:12:47,157
[SPEAKER_04]: So if this is promising that they might try to do a station, I think it would be really neat to see.

179
00:12:47,597 --> 00:12:47,757
[SPEAKER_04]: So...

180
00:12:48,770 --> 00:12:52,892
[SPEAKER_04]: As a gamer who feels underrepresented on the cable box right now, I think that's very interesting.

181
00:12:53,212 --> 00:12:55,734
[SPEAKER_02]: And GameTap, you know, that would be a good name for a station anyway.

182
00:12:55,754 --> 00:12:57,294
[SPEAKER_04]: Hmm, things to consider.

183
00:12:58,155 --> 00:12:59,736
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, so that's cool.

184
00:12:59,756 --> 00:13:00,236
[SPEAKER_04]: I like the media.

185
00:13:00,256 --> 00:13:00,776
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a big plus.

186
00:13:01,557 --> 00:13:04,558
[SPEAKER_04]: The service itself, you know, it does have some issues now.

187
00:13:04,598 --> 00:13:05,759
[SPEAKER_04]: I had some graphical glitches.

188
00:13:06,159 --> 00:13:10,521
[SPEAKER_04]: I have had the system lock up completely when some of the video tries to download.

189
00:13:10,901 --> 00:13:15,284
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if that's my system specifically or if that's, you know, maybe more people are going to have problems with that.

190
00:13:15,404 --> 00:13:15,764
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

191
00:13:16,304 --> 00:13:21,626
[SPEAKER_04]: But anyway, I do recommend GameTap, especially if you're a fan of retro gaming things.

192
00:13:22,927 --> 00:13:24,027
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a two-week free trial.

193
00:13:24,387 --> 00:13:25,048
[SPEAKER_04]: Check it out.

194
00:13:25,128 --> 00:13:25,648
[SPEAKER_04]: Why not?

195
00:13:26,448 --> 00:13:27,088
[SPEAKER_04]: It's pretty cool.

196
00:13:27,649 --> 00:13:35,892
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's one of those things that's going to get better with time, because it's still in the early stages, and I know they recently signed deals with Capcom and some other publishers as well, and I think I read something.

197
00:13:35,912 --> 00:13:38,773
[SPEAKER_04]: They want to grow to like 1,000 games by this time in a year or so.

198
00:13:39,522 --> 00:13:39,602
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki,

199
00:14:08,550 --> 00:14:09,051
[SPEAKER_02]: It looked good.

200
00:14:10,112 --> 00:14:10,572
[SPEAKER_02]: I like it.

201
00:14:11,233 --> 00:14:22,864
[SPEAKER_02]: Even something really cool if it was on a set-top console thing, like if they could come out with some sort of really bare-bones wireless controller thing, kind of like the Phantom.

202
00:14:22,884 --> 00:14:25,067
[SPEAKER_02]: They were talking about doing all streaming.

203
00:14:26,428 --> 00:14:28,990
[SPEAKER_02]: That model could work, except the Phantom sucks, but...

204
00:14:30,424 --> 00:14:39,046
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know, it looks good though, I mean, it's definitely something worth checking out, especially if you've got, definitely want some controllers or something for your PC, you know.

205
00:14:39,787 --> 00:14:49,509
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that's my other complaint, but that's not GameTap's fault, is that my controller sucks, so it's not, I mean, it is neat that GameTap, you know, picked it right up and knew what kind of controller I had, but it sucks.

206
00:14:49,769 --> 00:14:51,510
[SPEAKER_04]: I need to get something better if I want to use a controller.

207
00:14:51,752 --> 00:14:53,473
[SPEAKER_02]: But still, though, I mean, it looks good.

208
00:14:53,673 --> 00:14:55,213
[SPEAKER_02]: And I like the way the interface was.

209
00:14:55,313 --> 00:14:56,274
[SPEAKER_02]: That was really cool, actually.

210
00:14:56,414 --> 00:15:03,617
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, as somebody who often reports on this program about what's going on underground, would you actually pay for something like GameTap?

211
00:15:04,557 --> 00:15:05,217
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, no.

212
00:15:05,417 --> 00:15:13,461
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I don't have enough time to actually sit there and go play a lot of games online, let alone pay $9.95 a month for something.

213
00:15:13,761 --> 00:15:17,662
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, look, I still subscribe to Final Fantasy XI.

214
00:15:17,702 --> 00:15:18,363
[SPEAKER_02]: God knows why.

215
00:15:18,383 --> 00:15:19,923
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't played the game in, like, six months.

216
00:15:20,444 --> 00:15:21,104
[SPEAKER_02]: But, um...

217
00:15:22,148 --> 00:15:24,349
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure, I don't know, I guess.

218
00:15:24,389 --> 00:15:28,252
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that's going to be most people's sticking point with GameTap is that there's not a lot of new stuff on there.

219
00:15:28,272 --> 00:15:31,694
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you want to play the new cutting edge stuff, GameTap's probably not for you.

220
00:15:32,374 --> 00:15:33,695
[SPEAKER_04]: GameTap's more of like a library.

221
00:15:33,715 --> 00:15:37,897
[SPEAKER_04]: But it shows potential and maybe, who knows, companies might pick up on this model.

222
00:15:38,878 --> 00:15:46,783
[SPEAKER_04]: The other thing I wanted to say before we get into the news, I'm sorry to spend so much time on this, because this really made me think about this, the whole GameTap thing, is it really made me think about

223
00:15:47,543 --> 00:15:49,989
[SPEAKER_04]: I bet you anything this is how Nintendo Revolution is going to be set up.

224
00:15:50,069 --> 00:15:58,327
[SPEAKER_04]: I bet you Nintendo Revolution with its old Nintendo classics, because when I started not seeing the Nintendo games in GameTap, I thought, you know what, Nintendo Revolution, I bet you this is going to be the same model.

225
00:15:58,914 --> 00:16:05,159
[SPEAKER_04]: Choose your console, choose $9.95 a month, $14.95 a month, whatever they're going to charge, and then the unlimited play of the old Nintendo games.

226
00:16:05,420 --> 00:16:07,822
[SPEAKER_04]: I bet you anything, Revolution's going to have the same business model.

227
00:16:07,922 --> 00:16:24,015
[SPEAKER_02]: Or they could just do something very similar to Xbox Live, where you have the silver, which doesn't allow you to play the old games or whatever, and then you can pay the gold, which is $9.95, you get all the old games from all the systems, plus whatever other crap that they throw on there as well for download.

228
00:16:24,375 --> 00:16:24,535
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

229
00:16:24,776 --> 00:16:24,916
[SPEAKER_04]: Hmm.

230
00:16:25,256 --> 00:16:25,777
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

231
00:16:37,586 --> 00:16:46,411
[SPEAKER_04]: Microsoft, of course, has been shipping out a little more and more now, and they're saying that they're going to start doing these weekly shipments, but, you know, a lot of people still say, you know, don't hold your breath.

232
00:16:46,731 --> 00:16:51,593
[SPEAKER_04]: If you didn't pre-order, you're still not getting one of these until March, if you're an EB Games or GameStop shopper.

233
00:16:52,994 --> 00:17:01,238
[SPEAKER_04]: Local magazine, or not magazine, newspaper, San Jose Mercury News actually said, Microsoft is disappointed that it can't get more units of the Xbox 360 into the market.

234
00:17:01,558 --> 00:17:05,340
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's, you know, Microsoft has that regret there, so I don't know what

235
00:17:05,860 --> 00:17:07,721
[SPEAKER_04]: What that's about, because you'd think they'd do something about it.

236
00:17:08,001 --> 00:17:19,347
[SPEAKER_04]: But anyway, what's interesting is that the reporter from the San Jose Mercury News, Dean Takahashi, also said in his personal blog, various folks tell me that the shortage isn't a problem with chip yields.

237
00:17:19,847 --> 00:17:21,328
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's more of a systems issue.

238
00:17:21,428 --> 00:17:24,670
[SPEAKER_04]: When the boxes come together, they're working on getting more units out.

239
00:17:25,549 --> 00:17:30,591
[SPEAKER_04]: So this guy's saying that maybe it's not the chip shortage, it's the fact they just can't package them fast enough.

240
00:17:30,991 --> 00:17:33,551
[SPEAKER_04]: Which is a little disappointing, if that's really it.

241
00:17:33,892 --> 00:17:36,192
[SPEAKER_04]: Because you think they would have gotten the resources for that.

242
00:17:36,212 --> 00:17:42,654
[SPEAKER_02]: I think they might be afraid that they're running into these glitches that people are running into now with the overheating and stuff.

243
00:17:42,674 --> 00:17:45,995
[SPEAKER_02]: They're trying to get more working units that don't have these same problems.

244
00:17:46,976 --> 00:17:47,656
[SPEAKER_02]: That could be it.

245
00:17:47,816 --> 00:17:51,197
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, you know, comes down to a quality control problem or something.

246
00:17:52,344 --> 00:17:54,785
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, you have another story about the shipment of Xbox 360s.

247
00:17:55,005 --> 00:17:55,125
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, oh...

248
00:18:18,121 --> 00:18:34,677
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, there's a bit of word out because they were checking about Microsoft UK as far as if they were going to get their shipments out, and they said that they're actually on track to meet their 90-day forecast that they had out of 2.75 to 3 million units to go out.

249
00:18:36,719 --> 00:18:40,263
[SPEAKER_00]: As far as the US shipment is concerned,

250
00:18:40,883 --> 00:18:46,526
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a quote that I found that says they're working around the clock to deliver as many Xbox 360 consoles as humanly possible.

251
00:18:47,126 --> 00:18:54,650
[SPEAKER_00]: There is, though, a pretty rampant disappointment throughout Microsoft US about how low the shipments have been.

252
00:18:55,470 --> 00:18:58,212
[SPEAKER_00]: I still think it's purposeful, but...

253
00:18:59,398 --> 00:19:00,439
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll see, we'll see.

254
00:19:00,699 --> 00:19:02,281
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, Loki, you have a story also.

255
00:19:02,361 --> 00:19:04,344
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, there's one more thing about that.

256
00:19:04,724 --> 00:19:16,879
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, it was asked about that and said that there was any, Microsoft's competitors are actually even thinking that they're legitimate, that the shortage is legitimate.

257
00:19:17,379 --> 00:19:21,084
[SPEAKER_00]: The quote from Sony's Phil Harrison says that, I don't believe that for a second.

258
00:19:21,164 --> 00:19:27,992
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that it's clear that they're making every unit that they can, whether that is enough for demand or that they can't make enough is a question you'll have to put to Microsoft.

259
00:19:28,052 --> 00:19:29,654
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's definitely not done on purpose.

260
00:19:29,894 --> 00:19:32,737
[SPEAKER_04]: That's interesting little support from the competition there.

261
00:19:32,938 --> 00:19:33,218
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

262
00:19:33,358 --> 00:19:33,899
[SPEAKER_04]: Very interesting.

263
00:19:34,315 --> 00:19:38,117
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki, you have some news relating to the Xbox Live Diamond account now?

264
00:19:38,157 --> 00:19:40,198
[SPEAKER_04]: There's silver, gold, and diamond now?

265
00:19:40,258 --> 00:19:41,959
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it's a diamond card.

266
00:19:42,019 --> 00:19:44,781
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not necessarily anything that you have to pay for.

267
00:19:44,801 --> 00:19:52,385
[SPEAKER_02]: If you have an Xbox Live Gold membership, you can actually subscribe using your Gamertag to this diamond card.

268
00:19:52,545 --> 00:19:57,488
[SPEAKER_02]: It's basically this little card that you get that has this cool little graphics on there plus your Gamertag.

269
00:19:58,048 --> 00:20:02,950
[SPEAKER_02]: and they have a bunch of affiliates with Microsoft that are offering discounts for it.

270
00:20:02,970 --> 00:20:05,050
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's kind of like one of those discount cards that you get.

271
00:20:05,490 --> 00:20:16,534
[SPEAKER_02]: So basically if you go to Xbox, I believe it's XboxLiveDiamondCard.com Let me see here real quick.

272
00:20:16,994 --> 00:20:19,575
[SPEAKER_02]: It's XboxLiveDiamond.com, that's what it was.

273
00:20:20,575 --> 00:20:26,777
[SPEAKER_02]: You go there, you put your gamer tag in and you sign up and they'll basically ship it to your address that you have signed up with.

274
00:20:27,970 --> 00:20:30,575
[SPEAKER_04]: What if you have an Xbox regular live account?

275
00:20:31,316 --> 00:20:31,717
[SPEAKER_04]: No dice?

276
00:20:31,897 --> 00:20:32,518
[SPEAKER_04]: Or can you still get it?

277
00:20:32,719 --> 00:20:32,919
[SPEAKER_04]: Nope.

278
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:34,262
[SPEAKER_04]: Ah, sucks!

279
00:20:35,660 --> 00:20:36,561
[SPEAKER_02]: Give it the times, folks.

280
00:20:37,461 --> 00:20:44,806
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyways, no, but some of the actual affiliates that they have right now, they're talking about, like, McDonald's.

281
00:20:45,686 --> 00:20:49,189
[SPEAKER_02]: I saw, what was it, like, Carl's Jr., Burger King type stuff on there.

282
00:20:50,189 --> 00:20:53,571
[SPEAKER_04]: I know as well... Just what a gamer needs, fast food discounts.

283
00:20:53,611 --> 00:20:54,272
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, exactly.

284
00:20:54,292 --> 00:20:58,014
[SPEAKER_04]: How about getting some fresh choice discounts in there?

285
00:20:58,114 --> 00:21:00,416
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, yo, hey, no, no, no.

286
00:21:00,456 --> 00:21:03,397
[SPEAKER_02]: They've got, like, for example, and this is actually on the website, they have...

287
00:21:04,794 --> 00:21:09,197
[SPEAKER_02]: Hollywood Video, you rent a movie or video game, get the second rental free.

288
00:21:09,297 --> 00:21:11,839
[SPEAKER_02]: Sam Goody, 10% off of DVDs and CDs.

289
00:21:11,899 --> 00:21:16,222
[SPEAKER_02]: Quiznos, buy a sandwich, get the second one free.

290
00:21:17,442 --> 00:21:19,644
[SPEAKER_02]: 50% off of Cambridge Soundworks speakers.

291
00:21:19,664 --> 00:21:24,127
[SPEAKER_02]: 20% off of Etnies shoes.

292
00:21:24,587 --> 00:21:26,468
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a big list of stuff.

293
00:21:30,011 --> 00:21:30,611
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry, microphone.

294
00:21:30,948 --> 00:21:33,269
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going over to DarkSakura because maybe she'll back me up on this.

295
00:21:33,329 --> 00:21:37,851
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it just me or could Xbox be the moralist here and offer discounts for 24-hour fitness?

296
00:21:40,012 --> 00:21:46,614
[SPEAKER_00]: I wish they would, but they're going to cater to... Sorry, the typical gamer.

297
00:21:46,854 --> 00:21:54,297
[SPEAKER_00]: I hate to say it, but I don't know many average gamers who are into fitness and health.

298
00:21:54,357 --> 00:21:56,178
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I know lots who are, yeah, but...

299
00:21:56,946 --> 00:22:00,147
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, if you think about your average, say, your college... What's the stereotype?

300
00:22:00,647 --> 00:22:02,168
[SPEAKER_00]: The stereotype, like the college frat boy.

301
00:22:04,328 --> 00:22:04,508
[SPEAKER_00]: No.

302
00:22:06,109 --> 00:22:10,710
[SPEAKER_00]: And on top of that, honestly, promoting a lazy lifestyle helps their business.

303
00:22:12,170 --> 00:22:12,510
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki.

304
00:22:12,711 --> 00:22:16,031
[SPEAKER_02]: Honestly, which has Wi-Fi for the DS?

305
00:22:16,692 --> 00:22:18,172
[SPEAKER_02]: McDonald's or Fresh Choice?

306
00:22:19,112 --> 00:22:19,833
[SPEAKER_02]: I make my point.

307
00:22:19,933 --> 00:22:22,253
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to... Fresh Choice is only in California.

308
00:22:22,593 --> 00:22:24,954
[SPEAKER_04]: Oops, sorry, I made a regional joke.

309
00:22:26,158 --> 00:22:27,218
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry, what, Jamba Juice?

310
00:22:27,258 --> 00:22:27,859
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that nationwide?

311
00:22:27,879 --> 00:22:29,339
[SPEAKER_04]: That's borderline healthy.

312
00:22:29,679 --> 00:22:32,520
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't have Jamba Juice in my part of Alabama.

313
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:33,460
[SPEAKER_04]: Ah, forget it then.

314
00:22:34,841 --> 00:22:36,021
[SPEAKER_00]: So you know what they need to have?

315
00:22:36,261 --> 00:22:36,461
[SPEAKER_04]: What?

316
00:22:37,301 --> 00:22:42,143
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like they have the life fitness bikes that you can watch TV or listen to your CD player on.

317
00:22:42,603 --> 00:22:49,585
[SPEAKER_00]: They need to have one with like an Xbox 360 hooked up to it so it will shut down if you stop pedaling.

318
00:22:50,365 --> 00:22:50,825
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go.

319
00:22:51,185 --> 00:22:53,586
[SPEAKER_02]: Or if you pedal too fast and it gets too hot.

320
00:22:56,073 --> 00:22:56,413
[SPEAKER_04]: Lame.

321
00:22:56,774 --> 00:23:00,496
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, Loki, speaking of Xbox 360, what the hell's going on with Dead or Alive 4?

322
00:23:01,557 --> 00:23:03,959
[SPEAKER_02]: It's actually been delayed again.

323
00:23:03,979 --> 00:23:04,559
[SPEAKER_02]: Surprise!

324
00:23:05,059 --> 00:23:05,960
[SPEAKER_02]: Only a couple more days.

325
00:23:06,540 --> 00:23:07,121
[SPEAKER_02]: It's actually...

326
00:23:07,762 --> 00:23:15,484
[SPEAKER_02]: The people that have been reviewing the final copy, which is supposedly going gold here pretty soon, actually gave it 100%, you know, out of 100.

327
00:23:15,624 --> 00:23:17,344
[SPEAKER_02]: Just a really good game.

328
00:23:17,664 --> 00:23:25,205
[SPEAKER_02]: They're basically working on the online, make sure it's very balanced, and they just want to make sure the game's good before it goes out.

329
00:23:25,626 --> 00:23:30,326
[SPEAKER_02]: And supposedly now the new date is January 2nd, and it's going to be the new ship date on it.

330
00:23:30,447 --> 00:23:32,127
[SPEAKER_02]: So expect it in stores around the 3rd.

331
00:23:33,390 --> 00:23:33,910
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

332
00:23:58,599 --> 00:23:59,140
[SPEAKER_04]: That is it.

333
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:00,862
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh god, we covered that in a previous show.

334
00:24:00,883 --> 00:24:01,563
[SPEAKER_04]: That is it.

335
00:24:01,924 --> 00:24:02,285
[SPEAKER_02]: Nothing.

336
00:24:02,365 --> 00:24:02,645
[SPEAKER_02]: Nada.

337
00:24:03,006 --> 00:24:06,751
[SPEAKER_02]: And now we're just talking about Dead or Alive 4 for this next week.

338
00:24:07,051 --> 00:24:11,938
[SPEAKER_02]: Only game coming out on the consoles and then the next week there's a couple games and then that's it.

339
00:24:11,958 --> 00:24:13,681
[SPEAKER_02]: Then your next big game is going to be 25 to Life.

340
00:24:14,912 --> 00:24:17,934
[SPEAKER_04]: And then Jamie, you were saying that UK's lineup looks pretty similar.

341
00:24:18,134 --> 00:24:19,616
[SPEAKER_04]: It's pretty much a ghost town for a little while.

342
00:24:19,816 --> 00:24:20,096
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

343
00:24:20,676 --> 00:24:24,559
[SPEAKER_00]: So after the next big, you know, sell period comes up.

344
00:24:24,740 --> 00:24:24,960
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

345
00:24:25,380 --> 00:24:25,680
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

346
00:24:26,141 --> 00:24:26,461
[SPEAKER_04]: Interesting.

347
00:24:27,241 --> 00:24:27,602
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

348
00:24:27,822 --> 00:24:29,523
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's do some console balance here.

349
00:24:29,563 --> 00:24:30,524
[SPEAKER_04]: We've talked enough about Xbox 360.

350
00:24:30,564 --> 00:24:32,305
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's talk a little bit about PS3.

351
00:24:32,345 --> 00:24:36,909
[SPEAKER_04]: I know DarkSakura has a story about finally we know, like, a game that might be coming to PS3.

352
00:24:36,929 --> 00:24:37,029
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

353
00:24:39,312 --> 00:24:45,016
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, Unreal Tournament 2007 is coming out for the PlayStation 3 and it's set in Spring 2006.

354
00:24:45,496 --> 00:24:50,460
[SPEAKER_04]: I think the date is almost more interesting than the announcement of the game itself.

355
00:24:50,580 --> 00:24:51,180
[SPEAKER_04]: That's great.

356
00:24:51,460 --> 00:24:52,801
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's actually pretty cool.

357
00:24:53,121 --> 00:24:56,464
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I don't think it's too surprising that it's going to be on PlayStation 3.

358
00:24:57,624 --> 00:25:02,908
[SPEAKER_00]: But just the... I mean, honestly, to be out so quickly...

359
00:25:04,437 --> 00:25:06,379
[SPEAKER_04]: That's surprising to me, but actually I'm not so surprised.

360
00:25:06,679 --> 00:25:14,644
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I am a little bit surprised by the fact that it's coming on PS3 because when I think about Unreal Tournament previous games, I think of Xbox.

361
00:25:14,824 --> 00:25:19,287
[SPEAKER_04]: But maybe that's just because that's where I owned Unreal before I sold it back finally because I was bored of it.

362
00:25:19,667 --> 00:25:23,170
[SPEAKER_04]: But, you know, I kind of always thought of it as an Xbox title, but yeah.

363
00:25:24,741 --> 00:25:36,365
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I have a feeling that we're going to see it on Xbox 360, but just that it's going to be, I'm just sort of, the whole announcement together is sort of like the, whoa.

364
00:25:37,505 --> 00:25:48,609
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, they could do Grand Theft Auto San Andreas where they put it out on one console exclusively for, you know, X amount of months, nine months or whatever, and then they bring it out on the other systems later.

365
00:25:50,889 --> 00:26:07,053
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, I have a story about Nintendo Revolution, and that actually has to do with Zelda Twilight Princess, is that in a Nintendo magazine released in Europe, it's actually NGC, in their January 2006 issue, they're saying that Twilight Princess is going to be using the Revolution controller.

366
00:26:07,953 --> 00:26:12,795
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a quote here, our development team has decided to take extra time to add some incredible elements.

367
00:26:13,815 --> 00:26:18,056
[SPEAKER_04]: There were elements that Miyamoto said were simply far too good to leave out.

368
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:26,263
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, we kind of heard about the delays the first time being the fact that they're going to add something Revolution special here.

369
00:26:26,283 --> 00:26:28,104
[SPEAKER_04]: So it looks like the controller is a big part of that.

370
00:26:28,124 --> 00:26:31,205
[SPEAKER_04]: So it kind of pieces together with what we heard about the delay the first time.

371
00:26:31,286 --> 00:26:37,888
[SPEAKER_04]: So that whole innovative controller thing will somehow come into play with the Revolution.

372
00:26:38,269 --> 00:26:38,589
[SPEAKER_04]: Interesting.

373
00:26:39,670 --> 00:26:40,991
[SPEAKER_04]: That's really all I got on the Revolution.

374
00:26:41,011 --> 00:26:42,112
[SPEAKER_04]: There's not a whole lot of other news.

375
00:26:42,152 --> 00:26:42,832
[SPEAKER_04]: You got something?

376
00:26:42,912 --> 00:26:46,414
[SPEAKER_02]: I got something real quick on the PlayStation 3, which I thought was very interesting.

377
00:26:46,695 --> 00:26:52,338
[SPEAKER_02]: Everyone's wondering what the Blu-ray thing, they were talking about region coding, whether they're actually just going to get rid of it or what's going on.

378
00:26:52,458 --> 00:26:54,860
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, at least for the U.S.

379
00:26:54,960 --> 00:27:02,545
[SPEAKER_02]: and Japanese, there's not going to be a real big issue because the region coding for the Blu-ray has been announced, and Japan and U.S.

380
00:27:02,745 --> 00:27:05,487
[SPEAKER_02]: are in the same region code, which should be very interesting.

381
00:27:05,567 --> 00:27:05,667
[SPEAKER_02]: Hmm.

382
00:27:06,187 --> 00:27:14,270
[SPEAKER_02]: Unfortunately, Europe, they're going to be getting the bone again as they put it in this article here because they're in a different region.

383
00:27:14,290 --> 00:27:16,831
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, that's not a surprise because their TVs are a different format.

384
00:27:17,471 --> 00:27:21,252
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, but with the high-def TVs, I would have figured they're all in the same format now.

385
00:27:21,272 --> 00:27:22,773
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, but how many people really have high-def?

386
00:27:22,793 --> 00:27:23,593
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

387
00:27:24,873 --> 00:27:33,396
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, anyway, Loki, you had a story now about two of the systems here, PlayStation 3 versus Xbox 360 and what Microsoft's kind of,

388
00:27:33,956 --> 00:27:42,758
[SPEAKER_02]: The whole thing with the 360, it's always been from the get-go that whenever the PlayStation 3 was going to come out, they were going to launch Halo.

389
00:27:43,198 --> 00:27:56,320
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's only fitting that when they're going to announce the PlayStation 3 launch that they're going to announce the Halo 3 launch, which is supposedly going to happen at the Consumer Electronics Show 2006, which is happening actually in January here.

390
00:27:56,360 --> 00:28:00,481
[SPEAKER_02]: So a few more weeks and we'll know a little bit more about Halo 3.

391
00:28:01,226 --> 00:28:04,087
[SPEAKER_02]: Hopefully, at least that's what's going to be rumored to go down.

392
00:28:04,267 --> 00:28:07,168
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that's always Microsoft's little trump card, is that, well, we got Halo 3.

393
00:28:07,208 --> 00:28:08,769
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh-huh, we got Halo 3.

394
00:28:08,929 --> 00:28:09,649
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know what, though?

395
00:28:09,789 --> 00:28:17,673
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry to say it, but I mean, Halo is a pretty good game, but a lot of the other games that are coming out, like Gears of War right now, they're really good.

396
00:28:18,113 --> 00:28:28,557
[SPEAKER_02]: And this game better be damn amazing, like, you know, breakthrough good in order for it to... Because pretty soon people are going to get to the point where, Halo 3's coming out, oh, well, good for you, you know.

397
00:28:29,727 --> 00:28:30,007
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

398
00:28:30,047 --> 00:28:33,289
[SPEAKER_04]: I think there's a hardcore enough fanbase for Halo that it won't matter.

399
00:28:33,329 --> 00:28:35,190
[SPEAKER_04]: Halo 3 could blow goats, and it wouldn't matter.

400
00:28:35,250 --> 00:28:35,670
[SPEAKER_04]: It's Halo.

401
00:28:37,211 --> 00:28:37,992
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think it will, though.

402
00:28:38,032 --> 00:28:43,375
[SPEAKER_04]: I do think it'll raise the bar, because I have high expectations, and I don't think I'll be disappointed.

403
00:28:43,835 --> 00:28:44,275
[SPEAKER_04]: But we'll see.

404
00:28:44,716 --> 00:28:45,156
[SPEAKER_04]: Time will tell.

405
00:28:46,104 --> 00:29:01,169
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, let's move on, and DarkSakura, you know, she's got to keep us in check sometimes, especially during this holiday season, because, you know, you guys might be sitting there and you're playing these games all day long, but you need to remember to go outside once in a while, play in the snow, unless you're in California, then play in the rain.

406
00:29:01,469 --> 00:29:01,929
[SPEAKER_04]: Play in the mud.

407
00:29:02,529 --> 00:29:02,889
[SPEAKER_04]: Play in the mud.

408
00:29:03,910 --> 00:29:09,951
[SPEAKER_04]: And if we, you know, sat around and played video games all day long, we'd have no time to go out and get drunk off an eggnog.

409
00:29:11,032 --> 00:29:13,993
[SPEAKER_04]: So, anyway, DarkSakura's here to give us her advice column.

410
00:29:14,013 --> 00:29:14,573
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura,

411
00:29:15,114 --> 00:29:16,695
[SPEAKER_04]: What are you going to tell the kids about this week?

412
00:29:17,796 --> 00:29:21,800
[SPEAKER_00]: Today's piece of advice is how to stop a runaway one-horse open sleigh.

413
00:29:22,300 --> 00:29:25,383
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, things that could have been brought to my attention last week, DarkSakura.

414
00:29:25,923 --> 00:29:29,346
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry, I didn't know that you were riding in a one-horse open sleigh.

415
00:29:29,406 --> 00:29:29,947
[SPEAKER_04]: That's all right.

416
00:29:30,007 --> 00:29:30,527
[SPEAKER_04]: Tell me anyway.

417
00:29:30,747 --> 00:29:32,669
[SPEAKER_00]: Number one, stay in the sleigh.

418
00:29:33,230 --> 00:29:36,192
[SPEAKER_00]: Grip the cedar railing with one hand and the reins with the other.

419
00:29:37,794 --> 00:29:40,796
[SPEAKER_03]: Did they just kind of translate the rules of a Ferris wheel?

420
00:29:41,937 --> 00:29:42,438
[SPEAKER_03]: No, forget it.

421
00:29:42,458 --> 00:29:42,738
[SPEAKER_03]: Go ahead.

422
00:29:43,787 --> 00:29:44,768
[SPEAKER_00]: 2.

423
00:29:44,007 --> 00:29:44,768
[SPEAKER_00]: Grab the reins.

424
00:29:45,328 --> 00:29:49,872
[SPEAKER_00]: If you cannot reach the reins or they are loose and dragging on the ground, do not attempt to reach them.

425
00:29:50,292 --> 00:29:52,874
[SPEAKER_00]: Hold on to the sleigh and wait for the horses to tire.

426
00:29:53,414 --> 00:29:55,596
[SPEAKER_00]: Why is it horses if it's a one horse open sleigh?

427
00:29:55,616 --> 00:29:56,277
[SPEAKER_00]: It's so retarded.

428
00:29:56,777 --> 00:29:57,037
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, 3.

429
00:29:58,118 --> 00:30:01,120
[SPEAKER_00]: Tug and release the reins with a medium pressure.

430
00:30:01,641 --> 00:30:03,602
[SPEAKER_00]: Repeat until the horse begins to slow down.

431
00:30:05,083 --> 00:30:03,602
4.

432
00:30:05,664 --> 00:30:08,426
[SPEAKER_00]: When the horse slows down to a slow lope or a chop...

433
00:30:09,341 --> 00:30:10,762
[SPEAKER_00]: Pull one rein to the side.

434
00:30:11,082 --> 00:30:14,024
[SPEAKER_00]: With steady pressure, move the horse's head all the way around toward you.

435
00:30:14,384 --> 00:30:16,585
[SPEAKER_00]: This will cause the horse to begin going in a circle.

436
00:30:16,725 --> 00:30:19,186
[SPEAKER_00]: The horse will quickly tire of circling and slow to a walk.

437
00:30:20,047 --> 00:30:19,186
5.

438
00:30:20,507 --> 00:30:23,749
[SPEAKER_00]: Pull back with steady pressure on both reins until the horse stops.

439
00:30:24,609 --> 00:30:27,631
[SPEAKER_00]: But my final, final piece of advice... Yes, ma'am?

440
00:30:28,431 --> 00:30:28,972
[SPEAKER_00]: Take a taxi.

441
00:30:35,515 --> 00:30:36,896
[SPEAKER_04]: Big political news going on.

442
00:30:38,413 --> 00:30:40,795
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm loving this GamePolitics.com site.

443
00:30:40,895 --> 00:30:46,739
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the place for me to catch up on all the drama that's going on with various legislations and stuff.

444
00:30:47,039 --> 00:30:52,082
[SPEAKER_04]: They ran a couple stories this week about, of course, the California video game law being blocked by a federal judge.

445
00:30:52,102 --> 00:30:53,023
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if you've heard about this.

446
00:30:53,363 --> 00:30:57,966
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, hopefully, if you've listened to the show, you've heard about it, because we talked about it a lot when it first came out.

447
00:30:58,306 --> 00:31:06,612
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, a federal judge, that would be Judge Ronald White, actually blocked it, and somebody, I guess, filled GamePolitics in on the fact that

448
00:31:07,512 --> 00:31:10,435
[SPEAKER_04]: The games were protected by the First Amendment, said Judge White.

449
00:31:10,735 --> 00:31:14,217
[SPEAKER_04]: Children have First Amendment rights and the concept of strict scrutiny applies.

450
00:31:14,858 --> 00:31:15,779
[SPEAKER_04]: So, very interesting.

451
00:31:15,819 --> 00:31:18,881
[SPEAKER_04]: Basically, it's a First Amendment violation as a lot of critics said it was going to be.

452
00:31:19,341 --> 00:31:20,102
[SPEAKER_04]: So, very interesting.

453
00:31:20,502 --> 00:31:27,527
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, of course, rebuttal coming from Yee, Assemblyman Yee, who was the one who originally wrote this bill.

454
00:31:28,388 --> 00:31:29,549
[SPEAKER_04]: Basically, a type of, you know,

455
00:31:30,109 --> 00:31:37,137
[SPEAKER_04]: The injunction is a temporary phase, blah blah blah, we're confident that common sense will prevail, blah blah blah.

456
00:31:37,457 --> 00:31:38,419
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought this part was interesting.

457
00:31:38,859 --> 00:31:49,131
[SPEAKER_04]: Judge White's 17-page opinion granting the injunction made clear that while a preliminary injunction may be necessary in the short term, he also challenged some of the claims made by the plaintiffs.

458
00:31:51,593 --> 00:32:04,924
[SPEAKER_04]: He indicated that despite the claims of the ESA and the VDA that the Act is far too burdensome to apply as a standard to video game products, that the Act should be simple enough for an ordinary person to apply the games submitted to the court.

459
00:32:05,625 --> 00:32:07,146
[SPEAKER_04]: But then I also thought this was kind of interesting.

460
00:32:08,327 --> 00:32:16,994
[SPEAKER_04]: Medical data clearly indicates that these ultra-violent video games have harmful effects on kids, and thus we have a state interest to protect them, blah, blah, blah, you know where that's going.

461
00:32:17,014 --> 00:32:18,415
[SPEAKER_00]: Excuse me, that's actually crap.

462
00:32:19,591 --> 00:32:22,633
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you bring up something the exact opposite on a previous show?

463
00:32:22,653 --> 00:32:29,819
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, first of all, the Department of Justice has proven that there has been... We're actually at a 30-year all-time low in violence among youth.

464
00:32:30,459 --> 00:32:31,020
[SPEAKER_00]: First of all.

465
00:32:32,461 --> 00:32:36,024
[SPEAKER_03]: Secondly... Is that just because all the kids are killing each other, so there's less to commit crimes?

466
00:32:36,064 --> 00:32:36,204
[SPEAKER_00]: No.

467
00:32:36,244 --> 00:32:36,904
[SPEAKER_00]: Kidding, kidding.

468
00:32:37,024 --> 00:32:47,232
[SPEAKER_00]: It takes... But it would have to take some sort of really fucked-up-in-the-head child to just go out and say, Oh, I play Unreal Tournament.

469
00:32:47,252 --> 00:32:49,114
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to go kill everybody in my school.

470
00:32:51,982 --> 00:32:57,286
[SPEAKER_00]: And on one little thing, the comment about common sense, I do think common sense did prevail.

471
00:32:58,727 --> 00:32:59,347
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, snap.

472
00:33:01,529 --> 00:33:04,111
[SPEAKER_04]: We've had this debate for the past six months, so I'm almost a little done with it.

473
00:33:04,351 --> 00:33:09,814
[SPEAKER_04]: But my biggest issue with the California law was the fact that it didn't set a clear regulation.

474
00:33:09,834 --> 00:33:13,417
[SPEAKER_04]: It seemed like the bill was open to a lot of interpretation, so I hope if it is...

475
00:33:14,164 --> 00:33:25,056
[SPEAKER_04]: Going back to the drawing board, I hope that's what they work on is some type of clear set guideline, some type of third-party board reviews these games and gives them the rating, whatever, just, you know,

476
00:33:26,610 --> 00:33:28,691
[SPEAKER_04]: As I've said many times before, they should be done just like movies.

477
00:33:28,991 --> 00:33:29,511
[SPEAKER_04]: What's the big deal?

478
00:33:29,591 --> 00:33:31,731
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that's how they are done in Europe.

479
00:33:32,691 --> 00:33:33,892
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I'm disappointed about?

480
00:33:34,112 --> 00:33:34,292
[SPEAKER_00]: What?

481
00:33:34,452 --> 00:33:35,272
[SPEAKER_02]: Arnold Schwarzenegger.

482
00:33:35,712 --> 00:33:35,992
[SPEAKER_02]: Really?

483
00:33:36,112 --> 00:33:37,112
[SPEAKER_02]: What is the problem with him?

484
00:33:37,453 --> 00:33:41,353
[SPEAKER_02]: Would the Terminator let a law like this be appealed so simply?

485
00:33:41,754 --> 00:33:45,955
[SPEAKER_02]: No, the Terminator would go out and kill the bastards that try to appeal this law.

486
00:33:46,895 --> 00:33:49,855
[SPEAKER_02]: Arnold Schwarzenegger should be just ruling California with an iron fist.

487
00:33:51,436 --> 00:33:53,376
[SPEAKER_02]: Either that or he should quit and go back to movies again.

488
00:33:54,257 --> 00:33:55,777
[SPEAKER_03]: Can we switch topics, please?

489
00:33:56,980 --> 00:34:00,663
[SPEAKER_00]: Please, just because I think he's so pathetic that he's not going to get reelected, but still.

490
00:34:00,984 --> 00:34:04,367
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, you can send those cards and letters to DarkSakura, care of Orange Lounge Radio.

491
00:34:05,408 --> 00:34:07,169
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, to go at OrangeLoungeRadio.com, actually.

492
00:34:07,350 --> 00:34:07,730
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

493
00:34:08,591 --> 00:34:09,972
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, send those flowers.

494
00:34:10,913 --> 00:34:11,473
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, let's see.

495
00:34:11,754 --> 00:34:19,181
[SPEAKER_00]: That's okay, because I'm already going to go buy an island when I'm rich and infamous and create DarkSakura land.

496
00:34:20,293 --> 00:34:24,418
[SPEAKER_00]: Where I'm, you know, goddess of the island Where King Kong lives No!

497
00:34:24,798 --> 00:34:36,211
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't like big hairy apes And bad adaptations of movies Moving on, moving on This is the week, of course, where everybody's gotta whip out their best of the year list, right?

498
00:34:36,820 --> 00:34:44,404
[SPEAKER_04]: because, you know, we're in that time where it's almost the first of 2006, so everybody, I don't know, we feel this need in our society to rank things.

499
00:34:44,424 --> 00:34:46,425
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, we've got to have a frickin' best game of the year.

500
00:34:46,785 --> 00:34:48,946
[SPEAKER_04]: So, of course, some of the game sites are getting in on the fun.

501
00:34:49,546 --> 00:34:53,068
[SPEAKER_04]: GameSpy has released their list of the top ten games of the year.

502
00:34:53,148 --> 00:34:53,608
[SPEAKER_04]: Here they are.

503
00:34:54,229 --> 00:34:57,270
[SPEAKER_04]: Ten, Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell Chaos Theory on Xbox.

504
00:34:58,011 --> 00:35:00,872
[SPEAKER_04]: Nine, Legend of Zelda The Minish Cap, Game Boy Advance.

505
00:35:01,752 --> 00:35:04,634
[SPEAKER_04]: Eight, Dragon Quest VIII, Journey of the Cursed King, PlayStation 2.

506
00:35:06,299 --> 00:35:21,846
[SPEAKER_04]: 7, Half-Life 2 on the Xbox, 6, Battlefield 2 on the PC, 5, Call of Duty 2 on the Xbox 360, 4, Mario Kart DS on the Nintendo DS, 3, God of War on the PlayStation 2, 2, Resident Evil 4 on the GameCube, and 1, Civ 4 on the PC.

507
00:35:21,906 --> 00:35:23,147
[SPEAKER_04]: It was their number one game of the year.

508
00:35:24,027 --> 00:35:27,189
[SPEAKER_04]: GameSpot also did their Game of the Year, but they do it a little differently.

509
00:35:27,209 --> 00:35:29,410
[SPEAKER_04]: They nominate and then they name one as the Game of the Year.

510
00:35:29,950 --> 00:35:44,598
[SPEAKER_04]: Nominated, they nominated Battlefield 2, Civilization 4, FEAR, Forza Motorsport, God of War, Guild Wars, Guitar Hero, Mario Kart DS, Ninja Gaiden Black, and the winner was Resident Evil 4 on the GameCube.

511
00:35:45,218 --> 00:36:01,575
[SPEAKER_04]: So, I thought we could get in on the fun, but you know what guys, I don't like, say, I don't want to name the best game of the year, because, you know what, we're just, we're gamers, and you're gonna disagree with us no matter what we say, so we're gonna say our favorite game of 2005, and try to stay away from that whole controversial best of thing, because...

512
00:36:01,875 --> 00:36:04,937
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, even though we like to think we're important, we know we're not.

513
00:36:05,037 --> 00:36:07,578
[SPEAKER_04]: So, what were our favorite games of 2005?

514
00:36:07,678 --> 00:36:10,379
[SPEAKER_04]: I just want to know a runner-up and a best of and why.

515
00:36:10,459 --> 00:36:12,701
[SPEAKER_04]: So, Loki, your runner-up for best game of 2005.

516
00:36:13,061 --> 00:36:18,143
[SPEAKER_02]: My runner-up for best game of 2005 would be Burnout Legend.

517
00:36:18,263 --> 00:36:19,344
[SPEAKER_02]: Or Burnout Revenge, actually.

518
00:36:19,464 --> 00:36:20,364
[SPEAKER_02]: Screw Burnout Legends.

519
00:36:20,404 --> 00:36:21,465
[SPEAKER_02]: Burnout Legends sucked.

520
00:36:22,365 --> 00:36:23,226
[SPEAKER_02]: Burnout Revenge.

521
00:36:23,666 --> 00:36:26,728
[SPEAKER_02]: I played that game non-stop for months.

522
00:36:27,388 --> 00:36:29,109
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just really fun.

523
00:36:29,500 --> 00:36:36,266
[SPEAKER_02]: The only thing it lacked was good single-player mode, but it's just really fun, and I'm really looking forward to Burnout Revenge when it comes out in the 360.

524
00:36:37,947 --> 00:36:40,950
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course, my top game for... No, no, no.

525
00:36:40,970 --> 00:36:41,951
[SPEAKER_04]: Hold still.

526
00:36:42,011 --> 00:36:43,072
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to do my runner-up, too.

527
00:36:45,434 --> 00:36:46,495
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, let's see.

528
00:36:46,615 --> 00:36:55,303
[SPEAKER_04]: My runner-up for best game of the year, I would say probably the runner-up I would call best game of the year would probably be... This is a tough one for me, and...

529
00:36:56,255 --> 00:37:07,867
[SPEAKER_04]: When you put this next to my game of the year, I'm going to get some interesting reactions, but I would say my runner-up for best game of the year would be Meteos on Nintendo DS because I thought it was such a great puzzler.

530
00:37:07,927 --> 00:37:14,994
[SPEAKER_04]: It really started the wave of great games coming out for the DS, and I thought it was a puzzler with a lot of replayability value to it.

531
00:37:15,475 --> 00:37:19,339
[SPEAKER_04]: But I've got to admit, as far as DS goes, this is a very close call for me with Mario Kart DS.

532
00:37:19,679 --> 00:37:48,002
[SPEAKER_04]: but my problem with Mario Kart DS is that it did feel a little bit rushed and I don't think the online was polished enough for me to really consider it a game of the year title but I do acknowledge that Nintendo has made leaps and bounds in that whole online world thing and I think Mario Kart set a great precedent but I don't think I could call it my favorite game of the year because Meteos got a lot more play for me so Meteos would be my runner up for game of the year DarkSakura, you're runner up for game of the year Animal Crossing Animal Crossing DS, why?

533
00:37:49,581 --> 00:37:52,063
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know, it's just I play it every day.

534
00:37:53,084 --> 00:37:59,571
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the first game that I have, even when I was so busy with school, I've made time for it every day.

535
00:38:00,512 --> 00:38:00,772
[SPEAKER_04]: Awesome.

536
00:38:01,032 --> 00:38:02,994
[SPEAKER_00]: So it definitely gets it.

537
00:38:03,415 --> 00:38:03,835
[SPEAKER_04]: Sounds good.

538
00:38:04,176 --> 00:38:05,056
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki, game of the year.

539
00:38:05,657 --> 00:38:07,559
[SPEAKER_02]: My game of the year is just

540
00:38:08,072 --> 00:38:10,535
[SPEAKER_02]: Grand Theft Auto Liberty City Stories

541
00:38:31,192 --> 00:38:31,533
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura,

542
00:38:45,001 --> 00:38:50,844
[SPEAKER_04]: I haven't seen this get a lot of, it got a lot of critical acclaim when it first came out, but it's noticeably absent from a lot of these top game of the year lists.

543
00:38:51,224 --> 00:38:54,186
[SPEAKER_04]: And honestly, this was a game that sold systems.

544
00:38:54,466 --> 00:38:55,666
[SPEAKER_04]: This was a system seller.

545
00:38:55,927 --> 00:38:57,307
[SPEAKER_04]: This was an amazing game.

546
00:38:57,647 --> 00:39:00,969
[SPEAKER_04]: It revolutionized an entire genre of game.

547
00:39:01,409 --> 00:39:10,654
[SPEAKER_04]: And I realize this is going to sound a little weird when you put it next to my runner-up, but, because the fact that they were both made by the same company, but my runner-up is really the game that I played a heck of a lot of.

548
00:39:10,994 --> 00:39:15,118
[SPEAKER_04]: But my game of the year is something I got to recognize as being like it really pushed the bar.

549
00:39:15,559 --> 00:39:18,401
[SPEAKER_04]: Luminous for the PSP is absolutely my favorite game that came out this year.

550
00:39:19,222 --> 00:39:22,845
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's the reason to have a PSP for me.

551
00:39:23,306 --> 00:39:23,806
[SPEAKER_04]: It really is.

552
00:39:23,886 --> 00:39:28,891
[SPEAKER_04]: And I know I sound like a total puzzle game addict when you put those two side by side, but they really did.

553
00:39:29,151 --> 00:39:30,973
[SPEAKER_04]: They pushed the bar in different ways for their systems.

554
00:39:31,013 --> 00:39:34,316
[SPEAKER_04]: And this really was considered, we're looking at the year of the...

555
00:39:35,177 --> 00:39:35,557
[SPEAKER_04]: and DarkSakura.

556
00:39:56,044 --> 00:39:58,066
[SPEAKER_00]: Recycle, recycle, recycle Oh, let's not do MIDI this time

557
00:40:25,578 --> 00:40:29,061
[SPEAKER_00]: But Guitar Freaks actually makes it feel like you're playing a guitar.

558
00:40:29,162 --> 00:40:38,430
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought it was very, very cool of Red Octane to come out to my house and say, here, you can play Guitar Freaks in your living room on TV.

559
00:40:39,351 --> 00:40:46,298
[SPEAKER_00]: And I thought that that was really cool that they put that time and effort into it to try to make it something that...

560
00:40:47,219 --> 00:40:53,164
[SPEAKER_00]: The people would want to play, instead of just saying, oh, well, we're doing something like Guitar Freaks.

561
00:40:53,364 --> 00:40:53,904
[SPEAKER_00]: No, no, no, no.

562
00:40:54,364 --> 00:40:56,446
[SPEAKER_00]: They innovated on it, and I thought that was pretty cool.

563
00:40:57,447 --> 00:40:57,947
[SPEAKER_04]: There you have it.

564
00:40:57,987 --> 00:41:02,130
[SPEAKER_04]: Our picks for Games of the Year 2005.

565
00:41:02,230 --> 00:41:03,131
[SPEAKER_04]: Our picks.

566
00:41:03,171 --> 00:41:03,612
[SPEAKER_04]: There you have it.

567
00:41:03,712 --> 00:41:04,012
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

568
00:41:04,672 --> 00:41:05,273
[SPEAKER_04]: Moving on.

569
00:41:05,333 --> 00:41:08,175
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's talk about DarkSakura.

570
00:41:08,195 --> 00:41:12,098
[SPEAKER_04]: You had an interesting kind of feature story about innovation in the scene.

571
00:41:12,138 --> 00:41:13,159
[SPEAKER_04]: What's this all about?

572
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:21,662
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, speaking of innovation, there's an article up on GameSpot that I thought was pretty interesting.

573
00:41:21,762 --> 00:41:28,844
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, it was one that a friend of mine who's a game tester referred me to, and I thought that it was pretty interesting.

574
00:41:30,904 --> 00:41:43,147
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, there's not so much of a lack of innovation as much as a lack of wanting to use that innovation that's going out, you know?

575
00:41:45,549 --> 00:41:48,090
[SPEAKER_00]: There's actually a very good quote in here.

576
00:41:48,810 --> 00:41:52,151
[SPEAKER_00]: This is, innovation is dead, dying.

577
00:41:52,211 --> 00:41:58,853
[SPEAKER_00]: Every once in a while, somebody will slip something in that will shock us, but for the most part, there's no money in innovation, even if it's great.

578
00:41:59,413 --> 00:42:06,395
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, the industry is really looking for what do people already like, and can we make a sequel?

579
00:42:07,456 --> 00:42:10,178
[SPEAKER_00]: We are seeing such sequel-intensive titles now.

580
00:42:10,718 --> 00:42:13,100
[SPEAKER_00]: We see more Halos, more Metal Gear.

581
00:42:14,662 --> 00:42:18,125
[SPEAKER_00]: Instead, what was the last really innovative game that we got?

582
00:42:18,585 --> 00:42:21,768
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, Luminous I thought was very good, but it's still a puzzle game.

583
00:42:22,982 --> 00:42:25,984
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, Katamari Damacy now, that was innovation.

584
00:42:26,425 --> 00:42:27,906
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, we got a sequel this year.

585
00:42:27,926 --> 00:42:29,867
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's more of the same.

586
00:42:30,508 --> 00:42:31,248
[SPEAKER_04]: It is and it isn't.

587
00:42:31,308 --> 00:42:40,295
[SPEAKER_04]: It did expand on it, but I couldn't name Katamari Damacy or We Heart Katamari my game of the year because you're right, it wasn't as innovative as the first time you saw it, you know what I mean?

588
00:42:40,775 --> 00:42:52,429
[SPEAKER_00]: The best business for a publisher is to give people what you know they want.

589
00:42:52,950 --> 00:42:57,255
[SPEAKER_00]: And what you know they want is a sequel to what they won last time, so we don't see a whole lot of innovation.

590
00:42:57,675 --> 00:42:58,796
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what's interesting, DarkSakura?

591
00:42:58,836 --> 00:43:03,659
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm actually, as you're saying this and talking about sequels and everything, I'm looking at GameSpice Top 10, just up top of my head here.

592
00:43:04,159 --> 00:43:12,405
[SPEAKER_04]: Out of these 10 games on the list, only one of them is not a sequel or some type of story continuation type thing, like a...

593
00:43:13,465 --> 00:43:15,707
[SPEAKER_04]: Tom Clancy, Splinter Cell, Chaos Theory.

594
00:43:16,047 --> 00:43:18,608
[SPEAKER_04]: Only one of these games, God of War, is a new title.

595
00:43:18,628 --> 00:43:24,051
[SPEAKER_00]: There's another good quote from him in here, and this actually makes a lot of sense because I was just discussing this with somebody the other day.

596
00:43:24,111 --> 00:43:29,594
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't just with my husband, it was with a couple other people because Dan and I talk games all the time.

597
00:43:30,955 --> 00:43:36,378
[SPEAKER_00]: It's another one from him that says, the problem I have with the whole sequel thing is it's not just sequels.

598
00:43:36,958 --> 00:43:40,364
[SPEAKER_00]: It's once we see that World War II combat shooters work, we've got 50 of them.

599
00:43:40,724 --> 00:43:45,572
[SPEAKER_00]: The funny thing is that the next year after we saw that, everyone thought if World War II worked, Vietnam would work too.

600
00:43:45,953 --> 00:43:47,435
[SPEAKER_00]: But all those games were a disaster.

601
00:43:47,535 --> 00:43:50,240
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we've got how many more World War II games coming out?

602
00:43:51,766 --> 00:43:58,231
[SPEAKER_00]: So we see them trying to go on the same path and then it going, no, no, no, we like this.

603
00:43:58,951 --> 00:44:10,739
[SPEAKER_00]: So on top of that, it's not necessarily that there's not a willingness to innovate as much as there's not a willingness of the consumer base to test an innovative product.

604
00:44:11,721 --> 00:44:12,482
[SPEAKER_02]: Civil War First Person Shooter

605
00:44:32,345 --> 00:44:46,291
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, what do you think, I got a question for you, what do you think of Nintendo's sort of response to this whole thing, is this kind of like, Nintendo kind of sees, well, if the games aren't innovating, let's innovate the system, and kind of

606
00:44:46,829 --> 00:44:47,569
[SPEAKER_04]: See what happens.

607
00:44:47,949 --> 00:44:49,270
[SPEAKER_00]: See, they're taking a big risk.

608
00:44:49,410 --> 00:44:51,150
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that's what I say, too, is they're taking a big risk.

609
00:44:51,230 --> 00:44:54,751
[SPEAKER_00]: Nintendo, when you are Nintendo, you can do no wrong.

610
00:44:55,491 --> 00:44:56,472
[SPEAKER_04]: Virtually wrong.

611
00:44:57,132 --> 00:45:02,653
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, but the thing is that I think that they're really resting on their lulls quite a bit.

612
00:45:02,913 --> 00:45:04,594
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, hey, we're Nintendo.

613
00:45:04,634 --> 00:45:06,594
[SPEAKER_00]: We can get away with this crap, and you'll like it.

614
00:45:06,754 --> 00:45:08,315
[SPEAKER_00]: Because we said so, because we're Nintendo.

615
00:45:08,956 --> 00:45:17,959
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you think it's one of those things where Nintendo's sort of like, they're going to try this out, but even if they fail miserably, they can always turn the controller sideways and it's just like any other console.

616
00:45:17,979 --> 00:45:19,280
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what they're going to do?

617
00:45:19,300 --> 00:45:22,601
[SPEAKER_00]: I see them pulling an Xbox.

618
00:45:23,381 --> 00:45:24,661
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, you don't like this controller?

619
00:45:24,721 --> 00:45:25,562
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's another one.

620
00:45:26,162 --> 00:45:29,023
[SPEAKER_00]: You know when we got the controller S and now it's almost the standard?

621
00:45:29,778 --> 00:45:31,439
[SPEAKER_04]: Interesting, yeah, true, true.

622
00:45:31,459 --> 00:45:41,463
[SPEAKER_00]: The controller S that we got over here was the same one released with the Japanese systems, which I knew people freaking importing that controller because it's so much more comfortable than the Humongoid controller.

623
00:45:42,423 --> 00:45:44,124
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry, I got these little small fingers.

624
00:45:44,704 --> 00:45:45,965
[SPEAKER_00]: I wouldn't touch our Xbox.

625
00:45:46,005 --> 00:45:53,908
[SPEAKER_00]: So the whole thing is that now, I think that's what's going to happen with Nintendo is that people are going to go, oh, this controller is kind of stupid.

626
00:45:54,571 --> 00:45:55,331
[SPEAKER_00]: We want a real one.

627
00:45:56,252 --> 00:45:56,972
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know, again.

628
00:45:57,332 --> 00:45:58,852
[SPEAKER_00]: More money in the Nintendo pocket.

629
00:45:59,332 --> 00:46:05,935
[SPEAKER_04]: But if they put out the Zelda games and the Mario games, which you could question, is that really innovative?

630
00:46:06,235 --> 00:46:10,516
[SPEAKER_04]: But if they put that kind of stuff out with a controller and it does well, who knows?

631
00:46:11,096 --> 00:46:16,938
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I think that there's a very good example in here, though, of innovative projects that they've proven have worked.

632
00:46:17,258 --> 00:46:17,838
[SPEAKER_00]: Psychonauts.

633
00:46:19,719 --> 00:46:23,700
[SPEAKER_00]: Where it was officially going to be an Xbox exclusive and Microsoft dropped it.

634
00:46:25,541 --> 00:46:28,203
[SPEAKER_00]: They went to all over the place.

635
00:46:28,783 --> 00:46:30,765
[SPEAKER_00]: And Majesco, of course, picked it up.

636
00:46:31,485 --> 00:46:33,766
[SPEAKER_00]: The game was released on Xbox, PC, PS2.

637
00:46:34,567 --> 00:46:37,749
[SPEAKER_00]: I think one of the ones that's listed in here that they went to was Vivendi.

638
00:46:38,349 --> 00:46:42,291
[SPEAKER_00]: And they said they were interested in it, but said it was too risky.

639
00:46:42,852 --> 00:46:46,394
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's been one of the... I haven't played enough of that game to really know.

640
00:46:46,554 --> 00:46:47,655
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't honestly played much.

641
00:46:47,895 --> 00:46:51,477
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been considering it just because I've heard how neat it is, but...

642
00:46:52,059 --> 00:46:57,161
[SPEAKER_00]: But still, I mean, you know, it's also, though, why we don't get a lot of the really awesome Japanese games, I think.

643
00:46:57,961 --> 00:47:01,863
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we never got, what, we never got, what, Psychic Force over here?

644
00:47:01,903 --> 00:47:03,583
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, we damn near didn't get Katamari Damashii.

645
00:47:03,703 --> 00:47:05,144
[SPEAKER_04]: We didn't get Oz over here.

646
00:47:05,404 --> 00:47:05,584
[SPEAKER_00]: No.

647
00:47:06,084 --> 00:47:06,344
[SPEAKER_04]: So.

648
00:47:06,824 --> 00:47:10,025
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and on top of that, I think that's why it's taken so long for us to get DDR.

649
00:47:10,466 --> 00:47:11,366
[SPEAKER_00]: Why it's taken us so long.

650
00:47:11,606 --> 00:47:14,447
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, we're just now getting Beatmania, and how long has it been out in Japan?

651
00:47:15,247 --> 00:47:15,948
[SPEAKER_04]: Ninety, well.

652
00:47:15,968 --> 00:47:16,228
[SPEAKER_04]: Ninety-three.

653
00:47:16,608 --> 00:47:16,928
[SPEAKER_00]: Ninety-three.

654
00:47:17,779 --> 00:47:18,399
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, a long time.

655
00:47:18,679 --> 00:47:19,580
[SPEAKER_04]: No, not that long.

656
00:47:19,880 --> 00:47:20,060
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.

657
00:47:20,700 --> 00:47:21,000
[SPEAKER_04]: Really?

658
00:47:21,521 --> 00:47:21,781
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

659
00:47:22,201 --> 00:47:22,681
[SPEAKER_04]: It's been a while.

660
00:47:22,741 --> 00:47:23,482
[SPEAKER_04]: Geez.

661
00:47:23,542 --> 00:47:26,163
[SPEAKER_04]: No, because the first mix was on PlayStation.

662
00:47:26,183 --> 00:47:27,643
[SPEAKER_04]: PlayStation was... Oh, shit, maybe.

663
00:47:27,824 --> 00:47:28,324
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, anyway.

664
00:47:28,344 --> 00:47:29,164
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, whatever.

665
00:47:29,204 --> 00:47:29,844
[SPEAKER_04]: So a long time.

666
00:47:30,485 --> 00:47:33,666
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, keep in mind that the PlayStation was released in Japan in 93.

667
00:47:34,487 --> 00:47:34,807
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

668
00:47:35,227 --> 00:47:38,308
[SPEAKER_00]: Because we had mine in my dorm room in 94, and it was new.

669
00:47:38,868 --> 00:47:40,869
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow, wow, wow, wow.

670
00:47:41,029 --> 00:47:41,870
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's just been...

671
00:47:42,805 --> 00:47:44,305
[SPEAKER_00]: It takes forever for us to get anything.

672
00:47:44,465 --> 00:47:51,427
[SPEAKER_00]: And their market, I think, is always looking for something new and fresh and something different because there's so much that's homogenous in their society.

673
00:47:51,647 --> 00:47:58,149
[SPEAKER_04]: Do we have a skewed perspective, though, because we happen to be fans of those types of games, but maybe those games aren't really the ones that sell here?

674
00:47:58,209 --> 00:48:04,991
[SPEAKER_04]: Because when you look at the American market, despite our distaste towards these games, it is all about Madden.

675
00:48:05,563 --> 00:48:07,965
[SPEAKER_04]: and NBA Live and all that stuff.

676
00:48:08,405 --> 00:48:15,190
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that why we... I honestly think that the average American has too narrow a scope to look for anything new and different beyond what they already know.

677
00:48:16,511 --> 00:48:20,614
[SPEAKER_04]: Again, those cards and letters can go to... I said average.

678
00:48:20,874 --> 00:48:21,094
[SPEAKER_04]: I know.

679
00:48:21,374 --> 00:48:26,078
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you listen to this show, you've already demonstrated... You've already demonstrated that you have impeccable taste.

680
00:48:27,192 --> 00:48:28,774
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, we've got to move on to another story.

681
00:48:28,794 --> 00:48:30,495
[SPEAKER_04]: Where was this again?

682
00:48:30,655 --> 00:48:32,337
[SPEAKER_00]: I think this might be a good read.

683
00:48:32,377 --> 00:48:33,698
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll go ahead and give out the URL.

684
00:48:33,738 --> 00:48:40,784
[SPEAKER_00]: It's at gamespot.com slash news slash 6141519 dot html.

685
00:48:41,604 --> 00:48:42,445
[SPEAKER_00]: Very good article.

686
00:48:42,465 --> 00:48:44,226
[SPEAKER_00]: I suggest everyone give it a thorough reading.

687
00:48:44,907 --> 00:48:46,588
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, now let's counterbalance.

688
00:48:47,109 --> 00:48:52,193
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura has given us something very thoughtful and very good brain stimulant.

689
00:48:52,533 --> 00:48:55,676
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's go to the complete opposite end of the spectrum and talk about Jack Thompson.

690
00:48:57,620 --> 00:49:05,242
[SPEAKER_04]: Jack Thompson has bought stock in Take-Two Interactive, who publishes rockstar games like The Warriors and Grand Theft Auto San Andreas.

691
00:49:05,602 --> 00:49:08,742
[SPEAKER_04]: Why the hell would he do this when this is his main enemy, DarkSakura?

692
00:49:08,982 --> 00:49:10,122
[SPEAKER_04]: I know exactly why.

693
00:49:10,142 --> 00:49:10,483
[SPEAKER_00]: What's he doing?

694
00:49:10,603 --> 00:49:14,083
[SPEAKER_00]: We brought up something on the live show about people complaining about Konami.

695
00:49:14,623 --> 00:49:19,604
[SPEAKER_00]: He wants, as a stockholder, he has the right to challenge any business decision of the company.

696
00:49:20,204 --> 00:49:21,405
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's exactly what he's doing.

697
00:49:21,425 --> 00:49:23,025
[SPEAKER_04]: He wants to be able to go to stockholder meetings.

698
00:49:24,534 --> 00:49:28,959
[SPEAKER_00]: I have to say, as much as I loathe the man, that's freaking brilliant.

699
00:49:28,979 --> 00:49:30,500
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what's also brilliant?

700
00:49:30,801 --> 00:49:36,887
[SPEAKER_02]: The fact that he hasn't re-registered his site, StopKill.com, which, by the way, domain is up for auction right now.

701
00:49:37,288 --> 00:49:39,771
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you've got $60, you can actually go bid on it.

702
00:49:42,096 --> 00:49:44,518
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for watching!

703
00:50:07,344 --> 00:50:08,024
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, we'll see.

704
00:50:08,064 --> 00:50:10,465
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the sound of my wallet and zipping.

705
00:50:10,485 --> 00:50:11,386
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll see what happens.

706
00:50:11,426 --> 00:50:12,126
[SPEAKER_04]: More to come on that.

707
00:50:12,186 --> 00:50:14,247
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, we'll talk offline about that.

708
00:50:14,667 --> 00:50:20,209
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, what I thought was interesting, there's a little dig here at Microsoft CEO Bill Gates.

709
00:50:20,849 --> 00:50:21,550
[SPEAKER_04]: What's next?

710
00:50:21,610 --> 00:50:25,991
[SPEAKER_04]: A game in which players can practice flying commercial jetliners into the world trade towers?

711
00:50:26,391 --> 00:50:26,972
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I forgot.

712
00:50:27,032 --> 00:50:28,412
[SPEAKER_04]: Microsoft already did that.

713
00:50:28,512 --> 00:50:30,413
[SPEAKER_04]: Bank Times Man of the Year, Bill Gates.

714
00:50:31,693 --> 00:50:33,054
[SPEAKER_04]: Which I think is kind of a low blow.

715
00:50:33,114 --> 00:50:35,235
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, come on.

716
00:50:36,650 --> 00:50:38,272
[SPEAKER_02]: This is my open letter to Jack Thompson.

717
00:50:38,292 --> 00:50:38,452
[SPEAKER_02]: Give up.

718
00:50:38,492 --> 00:50:40,094
[SPEAKER_02]: Please, just give up.

719
00:50:40,154 --> 00:50:42,337
[SPEAKER_02]: People are laughing at you.

720
00:50:54,966 --> 00:51:00,352
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki, you had a story about In the Groove, because we were talking about Guitar Hero earlier.

721
00:51:00,392 --> 00:51:04,636
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's talk about Red Octane's other music game that wasn't quite as critically acclaimed, but what's going on with In the Groove?

722
00:51:04,816 --> 00:51:06,538
[SPEAKER_02]: In the Groove is coming to the PC.

723
00:51:08,171 --> 00:51:09,291
[SPEAKER_02]: More info coming soon in thegroove.com

724
00:51:33,362 --> 00:51:45,291
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, for those people actually still playing Step Mania, or as I like to call it, In The Groove 3, you can actually download a brand new build of Step Mania 4.0, which isn't finalized yet.

725
00:51:45,531 --> 00:51:52,416
[SPEAKER_02]: But anyways, this one has ParaPara support, which you can actually use the Japanese controller with, the USB one.

726
00:51:52,716 --> 00:51:54,438
[SPEAKER_02]: And they've got some test songs on there as well.

727
00:51:54,518 --> 00:51:56,579
[SPEAKER_02]: So definitely worth checking out.

728
00:51:56,599 --> 00:51:58,541
[SPEAKER_02]: You can find all that at stepmania.com.

729
00:51:59,141 --> 00:52:02,704
[SPEAKER_04]: Pada, pada, pada dice, because you don't look fruity enough playing DDR.

730
00:52:03,402 --> 00:52:03,922
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly.

731
00:52:04,143 --> 00:52:06,504
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, we've seen Fruity on that game.

732
00:52:07,065 --> 00:52:07,645
[SPEAKER_04]: I know, I know.

733
00:52:08,606 --> 00:52:12,609
[SPEAKER_04]: Drunken parties where people are putting on their girlfriends' clothing.

734
00:52:13,669 --> 00:52:17,233
[SPEAKER_04]: Moving on, before we get letters about that, let's talk about letters, DarkSakura.

735
00:52:17,273 --> 00:52:18,695
[SPEAKER_04]: What the hell's in our mailbag this week?

736
00:52:19,135 --> 00:52:25,722
[SPEAKER_04]: If you want to send fan letters or hate letters or letters that encourage stimulating conversation or news tips.

737
00:52:25,762 --> 00:52:28,045
[SPEAKER_04]: We have an awful lot of news tips from our buddy Rob.

738
00:52:28,926 --> 00:52:30,367
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me guess, do we have a Rob mail this week?

739
00:52:30,407 --> 00:52:32,590
[SPEAKER_00]: We actually did get a Rob mail, but I've already covered it.

740
00:52:34,091 --> 00:52:36,172
[SPEAKER_00]: Pulled that up from one of the sites that I review already.

741
00:52:36,793 --> 00:52:39,334
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, no, I haven't done it yet.

742
00:52:39,394 --> 00:52:40,675
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an article I'd already pulled up.

743
00:52:40,695 --> 00:52:40,935
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry.

744
00:52:41,035 --> 00:52:42,236
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, but you were going to cover it.

745
00:52:42,276 --> 00:52:42,976
[SPEAKER_00]: I was going to cover it.

746
00:52:42,996 --> 00:52:43,596
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, shit.

747
00:52:43,616 --> 00:52:44,117
[SPEAKER_04]: Go for it.

748
00:52:44,157 --> 00:52:44,437
[SPEAKER_04]: Why not?

749
00:52:44,457 --> 00:52:51,101
[SPEAKER_00]: About Ubisoft working with Taito to release Exit for the PSP.

750
00:52:52,161 --> 00:52:54,403
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a puzzle action game.

751
00:52:54,443 --> 00:52:55,483
[SPEAKER_00]: Looks like Oddworld 2.

752
00:52:56,444 --> 00:53:00,826
[SPEAKER_00]: But I got my news from a different source than what he linked to me.

753
00:53:01,046 --> 00:53:02,347
[SPEAKER_00]: Gotcha.

754
00:53:02,407 --> 00:53:03,308
[SPEAKER_00]: Just to give a little...

755
00:53:04,801 --> 00:53:18,855
[SPEAKER_00]: Background for this story, players control an escapologist called Mr. ESC, like your escape button, and must guide him around obstacles while rescuing people, you know, you have fires, earthquakes, stuff like that.

756
00:53:19,656 --> 00:53:23,220
[SPEAKER_00]: A hundred different scenarios, downloadable content also made available.

757
00:53:25,199 --> 00:53:28,701
[SPEAKER_00]: Exit's also going along just for our European listeners.

758
00:53:28,761 --> 00:53:41,088
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be... They're saying that it's going to fit in very well with some of the games being released like Frantics and Grip Shift, which is a puzzle driving game.

759
00:53:41,369 --> 00:53:42,709
[SPEAKER_00]: Cool.

760
00:53:43,610 --> 00:53:47,953
[SPEAKER_00]: Just a couple other of the emails received as soon as I poo them up.

761
00:53:48,153 --> 00:53:49,314
[SPEAKER_00]: One of our new listeners, Mason...

762
00:53:50,848 --> 00:53:52,970
[SPEAKER_00]: who I think has just the most awesome email ever.

763
00:53:52,990 --> 00:53:55,111
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to give it out, but yeah, I like donuts too.

764
00:53:56,853 --> 00:54:04,098
[SPEAKER_00]: So he imported Guitar Freak's controller and a copy of Guitar Freak's fourth Mexican game.

765
00:54:04,478 --> 00:54:05,339
[SPEAKER_00]: His controller broke.

766
00:54:05,699 --> 00:54:08,702
[SPEAKER_00]: Honestly, third-party controllers, never buy them.

767
00:54:09,302 --> 00:54:11,504
[SPEAKER_00]: Hello, get the Konami controller, sorry.

768
00:54:11,644 --> 00:54:16,227
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what's really interesting, you know, if you want to go into history, is that who was making most of the third-party controllers for Guitar Freak's?

769
00:54:16,668 --> 00:54:17,268
[SPEAKER_04]: Red Octane.

770
00:54:17,508 --> 00:54:18,509
[SPEAKER_04]: What's their bread and butter now?

771
00:54:19,073 --> 00:54:19,473
[SPEAKER_04]: Guitar Hero.

772
00:54:39,778 --> 00:54:41,059
[SPEAKER_00]: Guitar Hero is worth the money that you'll spend on it.

773
00:54:41,139 --> 00:54:42,440
[SPEAKER_04]: On top of that, if you're going to play Guitar Freaks...

774
00:55:07,323 --> 00:55:13,787
[SPEAKER_00]: I know of sites I will tell you via email where I do my ordering from because I don't want to, unless they want to pay us.

775
00:55:14,987 --> 00:55:20,230
[SPEAKER_00]: But I ordered both of my controllers for very reasonable, although they're a lot harder to get now.

776
00:55:20,350 --> 00:55:21,850
[SPEAKER_00]: And Guitar Hero has Freeze Pop.

777
00:55:21,990 --> 00:55:22,551
[SPEAKER_00]: Freeze Pop!

778
00:55:22,711 --> 00:55:23,551
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, they have Freeze Pop.

779
00:55:23,971 --> 00:55:28,774
[SPEAKER_00]: And also it's kind of funny if you can go back and watch the making of movies, they're really fun.

780
00:55:30,396 --> 00:55:30,936
[SPEAKER_04]: Any other emails?

781
00:55:31,537 --> 00:55:31,717
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.

782
00:55:34,159 --> 00:55:49,610
[SPEAKER_00]: Rodney, it says Roddycat, has sent us an email saying about how Sega, mentioning back to our Sega making a classic game story, and he's thinking it's Alex Kidd.

783
00:55:51,952 --> 00:55:53,053
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

784
00:55:53,513 --> 00:55:56,675
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, well, it's not quite running good.

785
00:55:56,856 --> 00:55:58,597
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a franchise that I think should be revived.

786
00:56:00,051 --> 00:56:09,415
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, actually, my favorite ever game for the Master System, next to, of course, Fantasy Zone, because I'm a big Fantasy Zone whore.

787
00:56:09,616 --> 00:56:10,136
[SPEAKER_04]: Space Harrier?

788
00:56:11,116 --> 00:56:12,617
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, yeah, Space Harrier.

789
00:56:13,157 --> 00:56:17,219
[SPEAKER_00]: But I mean, like, I really love Alex Kidd and Shinobi World.

790
00:56:18,540 --> 00:56:19,780
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just fun.

791
00:56:19,840 --> 00:56:25,083
[SPEAKER_04]: For me, this was more a Genesis thing, but it's got to be Altered Beast.

792
00:56:25,103 --> 00:56:26,724
[SPEAKER_04]: Rise from your grave.

793
00:56:26,824 --> 00:56:27,064
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway.

794
00:56:28,615 --> 00:56:37,528
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and also we got kudos from our Mac Man for reading his last letter on air.

795
00:56:38,069 --> 00:56:41,174
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to say hi again, Mac Man.

796
00:56:42,529 --> 00:56:46,872
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you want to get said hi to on the air, it's 2go at orangelawntrader.com is our email address.

797
00:56:46,892 --> 00:56:47,732
[SPEAKER_00]: He cracked me up.

798
00:56:47,812 --> 00:56:52,615
[SPEAKER_00]: He said, Macman equals I who have superb taste in computers.

799
00:56:55,737 --> 00:56:56,978
[SPEAKER_00]: Any rebuttal from Loki?

800
00:56:56,998 --> 00:56:57,538
[SPEAKER_00]: Loki rebuttal?

801
00:56:57,919 --> 00:56:58,239
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

802
00:56:58,779 --> 00:56:58,939
[SPEAKER_04]: Huh?

803
00:56:59,399 --> 00:56:59,700
[SPEAKER_04]: Forget it.

804
00:56:59,760 --> 00:57:03,222
[SPEAKER_00]: It's from Macman, our Mac player guy.

805
00:57:03,282 --> 00:57:05,543
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki's looking at porn on the other computer or something.

806
00:57:05,563 --> 00:57:08,165
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, we lost Loki now for minutes on end.

807
00:57:08,516 --> 00:57:10,397
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm looking at info, okay?

808
00:57:11,198 --> 00:57:11,738
[SPEAKER_04]: About porn.

809
00:57:11,759 --> 00:57:12,159
[SPEAKER_04]: About porn.

810
00:57:12,179 --> 00:57:13,180
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not about porn.

811
00:57:13,660 --> 00:57:17,723
[SPEAKER_02]: However, though, there is a game coming out that I really do want to check out.

812
00:57:17,763 --> 00:57:33,235
[SPEAKER_02]: This is coming out for our European audience, which was actually already released before as the simple 2000 series volume 50, the Daiboujin, which is going to be re-released as Demolition Girl.

813
00:57:33,575 --> 00:57:37,138
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a game where you fly around in a helicopter and you attack 50-foot women.

814
00:57:38,325 --> 00:57:40,547
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know, that just appeals to me in some way.

815
00:57:41,147 --> 00:57:43,329
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki, Loki, mailbag, mailbag time.

816
00:57:43,389 --> 00:57:44,550
[SPEAKER_04]: Your time later, mailbag time.

817
00:57:44,990 --> 00:57:45,771
[SPEAKER_06]: Actually, I'm done.

818
00:57:45,891 --> 00:57:46,251
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, that's it.

819
00:57:46,291 --> 00:57:46,772
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, never mind.

820
00:57:47,112 --> 00:57:48,433
[SPEAKER_04]: Anything else then about The Demolition Girl?

821
00:57:49,234 --> 00:57:50,295
[SPEAKER_04]: Does it have Daryl Hannah in it?

822
00:57:50,315 --> 00:57:57,480
[SPEAKER_02]: It does not have Daryl Hannah in it, but it's actually being released in Europe as a budget title, which is very interesting.

823
00:57:57,701 --> 00:57:59,722
[SPEAKER_02]: Definitely need to check it out, among other games.

824
00:58:00,863 --> 00:58:02,865
[SPEAKER_02]: Kingdom Hearts 2, which I'll be playing probably this week.

825
00:58:02,925 --> 00:58:04,406
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, Kingdom Hearts 2!

826
00:58:05,187 --> 00:58:09,070
[SPEAKER_00]: I watched the ending because I'm bad.

827
00:58:09,911 --> 00:58:10,771
[SPEAKER_00]: I am so awful.

828
00:58:11,352 --> 00:58:15,996
[SPEAKER_00]: And the ending leaves me with many more questions than anything else I've seen on the internet.

829
00:58:16,036 --> 00:58:18,598
[SPEAKER_04]: So in other words, it's inevitable there's going to be a Kingdom Hearts 3.

830
00:58:19,519 --> 00:58:20,499
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know, actually.

831
00:58:20,519 --> 00:58:20,820
[SPEAKER_00]: 3 and 4.

832
00:58:21,480 --> 00:58:23,782
[SPEAKER_00]: But Jamie needs this game now.

833
00:58:23,862 --> 00:58:25,063
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm freaking tempted to import it.

834
00:58:26,853 --> 00:58:28,954
[SPEAKER_00]: Except I don't know, I can't read Japanese very well.

835
00:58:29,494 --> 00:58:38,057
[SPEAKER_04]: This is a good plug for our live station which runs music from games 24 hours a day, 7 days a week at OrangeLunchRadio.com because we just put in rotation this week the theme from Kingdom Hearts 2.

836
00:58:38,197 --> 00:58:39,737
[SPEAKER_04]: It's Utada Hikaru with Passion.

837
00:58:42,658 --> 00:58:45,039
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course I picked like the worst clip from, let's try another clip.

838
00:58:53,567 --> 00:58:55,289
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, check that out over at OrangeLunchRadio.com.

839
00:58:55,309 --> 00:58:59,535
[SPEAKER_00]: That's in rotation now, so... I need that for one particular level, actually.

840
00:59:00,396 --> 00:59:01,237
[SPEAKER_00]: Freakin' Tron.

841
00:59:01,958 --> 00:59:02,939
[SPEAKER_04]: Freakin' Tron, I know.

842
00:59:02,959 --> 00:59:03,760
[SPEAKER_04]: That'd be awesome.

843
00:59:04,280 --> 00:59:05,902
[SPEAKER_04]: They put a Chicken Little level in there.

844
00:59:06,183 --> 00:59:07,865
[SPEAKER_02]: No, Chicken Little is not in there.

845
00:59:07,905 --> 00:59:08,486
[SPEAKER_02]: He's a summon.

846
00:59:09,444 --> 00:59:14,185
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, okay, because I saw that Zach Braff was doing the voice in the American version, because they released the voice.

847
00:59:14,285 --> 00:59:18,466
[SPEAKER_00]: That list is the one off of IMDb, and it is not correct.

848
00:59:18,626 --> 00:59:19,007
[SPEAKER_04]: Really?

849
00:59:19,747 --> 00:59:19,947
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh.

850
00:59:21,467 --> 00:59:27,829
[SPEAKER_00]: Do not trust anything that IMDb puts out as far as voice acting goes until the official list comes out.

851
00:59:27,849 --> 00:59:30,790
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that's because IMDb is user-powered, right?

852
00:59:31,230 --> 00:59:31,590
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.

853
00:59:32,430 --> 00:59:35,471
[SPEAKER_00]: And all they did was port over the actors who played them.

854
00:59:36,792 --> 00:59:40,594
[SPEAKER_00]: However, I do have a strong feeling that they are going to get Johnny Depp.

855
00:59:41,654 --> 00:59:42,114
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, we'll see.

856
00:59:42,975 --> 00:59:46,737
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and, and, and, there's also Steamboat Willie, lovely, so cute.

857
00:59:48,433 --> 00:59:54,635
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, let's go over to Loki who has a couple more stories for us about, well just clear us out whatever stories you got over there Loki.

858
00:59:54,695 --> 01:00:01,357
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, real quick, there was actually some really nice Christmas gifts that a few game publishers have been putting out.

859
01:00:02,178 --> 01:00:06,619
[SPEAKER_02]: These being in the form of new downloads for some games actually out there right now.

860
01:00:07,159 --> 01:00:11,481
[SPEAKER_02]: The first one starting off with the Xbox is they've actually got some map packs coming out.

861
01:00:11,994 --> 01:00:14,255
[SPEAKER_02]: for Star Wars Battlefront 2.

862
01:00:14,955 --> 01:00:18,336
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can get those actually available on Xbox Live.

863
01:00:19,036 --> 01:00:19,776
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're available.

864
01:00:20,016 --> 01:00:28,679
[SPEAKER_02]: They're going to be having another January pack coming out at about $5 featuring some more maps in there as well, which is pretty cool.

865
01:00:29,539 --> 01:00:32,600
[SPEAKER_02]: The other map pack that's coming out is actually for the PC.

866
01:00:33,160 --> 01:00:34,500
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's going to be for Quake 4.

867
01:00:34,800 --> 01:00:40,462
[SPEAKER_02]: And you've got three free maps that you can actually download on the official website idsoftware.com.

868
01:00:41,311 --> 01:00:43,718
[SPEAKER_02]: So definitely check those out if you play some Quake 4.

869
01:00:44,299 --> 01:00:45,001
[SPEAKER_02]: And then finally...

870
01:00:46,556 --> 01:00:49,478
[SPEAKER_02]: There was actually some for... Oh, no way.

871
01:00:49,578 --> 01:00:50,199
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, that was it.

872
01:00:50,659 --> 01:00:51,119
[SPEAKER_02]: My mistake.

873
01:00:51,159 --> 01:00:52,660
[SPEAKER_02]: I had two of the same story on there.

874
01:00:52,760 --> 01:00:57,424
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought you had a story about Walmart stockpiling 360s or something.

875
01:00:57,444 --> 01:01:05,409
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, Walmart's pulling a Best Buy, basically, and they're going to be doing a sale for New Year's, and they're stockpiling 360s, supposedly.

876
01:01:05,749 --> 01:01:06,150
[SPEAKER_02]: Interesting.

877
01:01:06,210 --> 01:01:11,653
[SPEAKER_02]: So definitely, if you haven't got a 360 yet, still interested in getting one, go check out your Walmart on New Year's Day.

878
01:01:12,014 --> 01:01:12,354
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

879
01:01:13,010 --> 01:01:23,999
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been hearing rumors that, and I can't say what my source is or where I got it from, but some of the game vendors are hoping to have their pre-orders filled by actually mid to end January.

880
01:01:24,499 --> 01:01:25,660
[SPEAKER_04]: That's good news for a lot of people.

881
01:01:25,880 --> 01:01:26,561
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's hope it's true.

882
01:01:27,762 --> 01:01:28,342
[SPEAKER_04]: Anything else, Loki?

883
01:01:29,683 --> 01:01:38,770
[SPEAKER_02]: Finally, I was just going to mention, kind of in the homebrew sense, Senile Team, the people behind this kind of a Streets of Rage franchise,

884
01:01:43,824 --> 01:01:57,014
[SPEAKER_02]: They have a new game coming out called Age of Beast, which looks like an updated version of Streets of Rage, but they've done it in more of the Altered Beast type thing.

885
01:01:57,555 --> 01:01:58,635
[SPEAKER_02]: It should be really cool.

886
01:01:58,715 --> 01:02:04,080
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm actually looking forward to playing around with it some more because you can do some shooter type stuff.

887
01:02:04,120 --> 01:02:04,700
[SPEAKER_02]: Pretty good game.

888
01:02:04,780 --> 01:02:08,563
[SPEAKER_02]: Definitely check them out at senileteam.segaforums.com

889
01:02:09,506 --> 01:02:09,826
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

890
01:02:10,786 --> 01:02:21,750
[SPEAKER_04]: And finally tonight, boys and girls, I hope this didn't happen to you, but World of Warcraft pulled what I would call a Ragnarok online this week when they said, we ban you.

891
01:02:22,570 --> 01:02:26,271
[SPEAKER_04]: We ban you to 18,000 accounts.

892
01:02:26,911 --> 01:02:27,652
[SPEAKER_04]: Canceled.

893
01:02:28,072 --> 01:02:29,092
[SPEAKER_04]: Why were they canceled?

894
01:02:30,080 --> 01:02:33,342
[SPEAKER_04]: Third-party programs to farm gold and items.

895
01:02:33,883 --> 01:02:35,564
[SPEAKER_04]: Stop effing up the economy.

896
01:02:35,964 --> 01:02:36,705
[SPEAKER_04]: You're banned.

897
01:02:37,926 --> 01:02:39,567
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually got my account canceled.

898
01:02:40,708 --> 01:02:42,269
[SPEAKER_04]: You weren't one of these 18,000, were you?

899
01:02:42,489 --> 01:02:44,551
[SPEAKER_00]: No, they rejected my ATM card because I got a new one.

900
01:02:45,812 --> 01:02:47,313
[SPEAKER_04]: That's not nearly as interesting.

901
01:02:48,291 --> 01:02:50,012
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't care if it's about you, that's not interesting.

902
01:02:52,213 --> 01:02:54,495
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course if it's about me it's interesting, I'm a show diva.

903
01:02:54,515 --> 01:02:58,677
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to go around now and get everybody's final thought because we're about to wrap it up.

904
01:02:58,717 --> 01:03:01,579
[SPEAKER_04]: We do have one more note for you guys, but first the final thoughts.

905
01:03:02,220 --> 01:03:03,080
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki, your final thought.

906
01:03:03,681 --> 01:03:09,644
[SPEAKER_02]: My final thought is I've got to get to playing some of these games that I have on cue to basically play.

907
01:03:10,505 --> 01:03:13,887
[SPEAKER_02]: Kingdom Hearts 2, of course, because I have a walkthrough because I can't read Japanese.

908
01:03:15,038 --> 01:03:29,544
[SPEAKER_04]: my final thought would be January 1st on our live show we're making a huge announcement about the future of Orange Lounge Radio it will change everything it's going to be good check it out of course if you missed that we will say it on the podcast as well

909
01:03:31,306 --> 01:03:34,948
[SPEAKER_02]: and we're getting drunk?

910
01:03:35,649 --> 01:03:38,831
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, yeah, that'll be interesting nonetheless.

911
01:03:39,511 --> 01:03:43,833
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course that will air at 2 a.m.

912
01:03:44,374 --> 01:03:44,994
[SPEAKER_00]: London time.

913
01:03:45,014 --> 01:03:46,775
[SPEAKER_04]: 6.30 to 9.30.

914
01:03:47,115 --> 01:03:49,016
[SPEAKER_04]: The next day.

915
01:03:49,777 --> 01:03:50,977
[SPEAKER_04]: Big, big announcement January 1st.

916
01:03:51,557 --> 01:03:52,898
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, your final thought.

917
01:03:53,839 --> 01:03:57,741
[SPEAKER_00]: Reject false icons and number two, remember, don't shoot the food.

918
01:03:59,087 --> 01:04:06,311
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, of course, we have one other little footnote because, you know, it is the holiday season and it's, you know, we're still spreading the cheer.

919
01:04:06,371 --> 01:04:10,234
[SPEAKER_04]: Even if Christmas is over, there's still, you know, Hanukkah, Kwanzaa, a bunch of holidays.

920
01:04:10,254 --> 01:04:12,135
[SPEAKER_00]: My brother told me happy Kwanzaa today.

921
01:04:12,155 --> 01:04:15,617
[SPEAKER_04]: Because you're so, you know, Kwanzaa celebrating.

922
01:04:15,657 --> 01:04:16,458
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway.

923
01:04:18,739 --> 01:04:18,939
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway.

924
01:04:20,953 --> 01:04:21,253
[SPEAKER_04]: DreamStation.cc

925
01:04:46,238 --> 01:04:49,701
[SPEAKER_04]: The folks from the Dream Station Video Game Show actually put this little happy holiday song together.

926
01:04:50,022 --> 01:04:55,807
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's kind of funny because they talk about noobs getting pwned in it, which is, you know, if you speak elite, that's pretty funny.

927
01:04:56,327 --> 01:04:58,029
[SPEAKER_04]: So we thought we'd play it for you guys here.

928
01:04:58,089 --> 01:05:03,694
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you want to hear more crazy antics from these guys, head on over to www.dreamstation.cc.

929
01:05:03,774 --> 01:05:06,717
[SPEAKER_04]: And remember, kids, support independent podcasts.

930
01:05:08,178 --> 01:05:09,179
[SPEAKER_04]: And we're closing with this.

931
01:05:09,259 --> 01:05:10,160
[SPEAKER_04]: So have a great week.

932
01:05:10,180 --> 01:05:10,961
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll see you next time.

933
01:05:15,526 --> 01:05:44,025
[SPEAKER_05]: The sounds of screams of love and stream, the camping center you haven't seen It's Christmas at Dream Station, where all the noobs get pwned The Halo fans with their demands, gripping on keyboard and mouse commands And FPS is still the best when playing it on PC A head shoppie comes open, it's time to make him fall And loyal Jack before he's back will sue us for house and door How brand new it feels to click your heels, writing this pro as you hear him squeal The council's full of party that likes you'll never know

934
01:05:44,485 --> 01:05:47,822
[SPEAKER_05]: It's Christmas Happy Station where all the news get pwned

935
01:05:55,396 --> 01:06:16,765
[SPEAKER_05]: The Net Cafe is where I play Addicted to gaming, I spend my pay It's Christmas in Korea, I haven't had food for days Xbox knows it's only slow Poor Nintendo has nothing to show The PC's slowly dying, except for the MMO The ducks are playing Madden, the chicks are playing WoW The PC dudes are fragging noobs, the noobs are wondering how

936
01:06:17,505 --> 01:06:19,126
[SPEAKER_05]: And just one final footnote.

937
01:06:19,166 --> 01:06:20,067
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't expect us to sing.

938
01:06:20,167 --> 01:06:20,247
[SPEAKER_05]: Ever.

939
01:06:20,287 --> 01:06:20,487
[SPEAKER_05]: Ever.

940
01:06:20,527 --> 01:06:22,649
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, I think that we should end this show on a high note.

941
01:06:22,669 --> 01:06:22,869
[SPEAKER_05]: What?

942
01:06:22,929 --> 01:06:24,590
[SPEAKER_05]: Except I can't sing that high note.

943
01:06:42,220 --> 01:06:45,042
[SPEAKER_02]: We already know how the whole singing thing went down.

944
01:06:46,443 --> 01:06:46,843
[SPEAKER_04]: I forgot.

945
01:06:46,883 --> 01:06:48,244
[SPEAKER_04]: Put a copy of Karaoke Revolution.

946
01:06:48,364 --> 01:06:49,885
[SPEAKER_00]: No, no, no.

947
01:06:50,305 --> 01:06:57,049
[SPEAKER_00]: I think when we do our little outtakes DVD, we need to put I'm Staying In on it.

948
01:06:59,250 --> 01:07:00,130
[SPEAKER_04]: Longest show ever.

949
01:07:00,230 --> 01:07:00,871
[SPEAKER_04]: Good job, guys.

950
01:07:00,911 --> 01:07:02,012
[SPEAKER_04]: Happy holidays.

951
01:07:02,052 --> 01:07:03,092
[SPEAKER_04]: This is our gift.

952
01:07:03,372 --> 01:07:04,453
[SPEAKER_04]: See you next time.

953
01:07:05,854 --> 01:07:09,397
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the end of another Orange Lounge Radio To Go edition.

954
