00:00:00,464 --> 00:00:03,025
[SPEAKER_05]: Orange Lounge Radio To Go Edition, week of December 19th, 2005.

2
00:00:03,305 --> 00:00:13,547
[SPEAKER_03]: You're tuned in to the Orange Lounge Radio To Go Edition, your podcast home for all the latest video game news and gamer chat.

3
00:00:13,827 --> 00:00:17,668
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, here are your hosts, DarkSakura, Sky, and Loki.

4
00:00:19,568 --> 00:00:20,348
[SPEAKER_05]: Hello, everybody.

5
00:00:20,448 --> 00:00:27,650
[SPEAKER_05]: Once again, welcome to Orange Lounge Radio To Go, that podcast dedicated to video games and gaming.

6
00:00:28,493 --> 00:00:35,718
[SPEAKER_05]: We especially like to talk about games that don't suck, but you know, once in a while we gotta bring up games that do suck because we have to tell you to avoid them, like the plague.

7
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:42,983
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm happy to report that I've escaped the plague, I'm not sick anymore, I'm feeling a lot better than I was last week for our 50th episode.

8
00:00:43,044 --> 00:00:45,585
[SPEAKER_05]: But over there, DarkSakura, how you doing?

9
00:00:45,605 --> 00:00:46,926
[SPEAKER_05]: You still a little plague-y, DarkSakura?

10
00:00:46,946 --> 00:00:49,248
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm still the carrier of the evil plague.

11
00:00:49,628 --> 00:00:50,669
[SPEAKER_05]: Are you infected?

12
00:00:51,830 --> 00:00:57,454
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm infected, but I don't think that I have the T-virus anymore because I haven't started trying to, you know,

13
00:00:57,915 --> 00:00:59,475
[SPEAKER_01]: to eat my husband for dinner.

14
00:00:59,755 --> 00:01:00,696
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh good, that's good.

15
00:01:00,816 --> 00:01:03,096
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I haven't been sniffing his spicy brains.

16
00:01:03,156 --> 00:01:05,677
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, you've gone seven weeks without doing that, huh?

17
00:01:06,117 --> 00:01:09,718
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I've actually gone seven weeks without eating much of anything.

18
00:01:10,858 --> 00:01:13,458
[SPEAKER_01]: But hey, leaves me more money to spend on games.

19
00:01:13,659 --> 00:01:14,159
[SPEAKER_05]: There you go.

20
00:01:14,739 --> 00:01:16,099
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki, I won't get to your games in a minute.

21
00:01:16,139 --> 00:01:17,799
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki, how you doing?

22
00:01:18,740 --> 00:01:20,740
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm still a bit congested, yes.

23
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:22,941
[SPEAKER_05]: But mostly plague-free, like 99.7% plague-free.

24
00:01:25,034 --> 00:01:33,437
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, 99.9% Plague 3, but I did think I had the T-Virus because I did eat my fiancÃ©.

25
00:01:33,517 --> 00:01:38,179
[SPEAKER_01]: You need to not bring that on the show.

26
00:01:38,633 --> 00:01:47,519
[SPEAKER_05]: My name is Rob Roberts, also known as Sky, and I will be going back to a cleaner subject, such as, how was your gaming week, DarkSakura?

27
00:01:47,599 --> 00:01:49,361
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's a clean subject, huh?

28
00:01:49,401 --> 00:01:52,303
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, DarkSakura, lots of Animal Crossing.

29
00:01:52,323 --> 00:01:54,684
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, I'm sorry, I don't want to talk too much about Animal Crossing again.

30
00:01:54,845 --> 00:01:55,085
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, no.

31
00:01:56,226 --> 00:01:56,766
[SPEAKER_01]: Guess what?

32
00:01:56,906 --> 00:01:58,087
[SPEAKER_01]: I played Animal Crossing.

33
00:01:58,867 --> 00:01:59,428
[SPEAKER_05]: Anything else?

34
00:02:02,501 --> 00:02:04,241
[SPEAKER_01]: Not really, because last week was finals.

35
00:02:05,322 --> 00:02:07,222
[SPEAKER_01]: However, I did do something game-related.

36
00:02:08,562 --> 00:02:12,983
[SPEAKER_01]: And I can post a link to this on our forums, which people should be visiting.

37
00:02:13,123 --> 00:02:21,945
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, at OrangeLogsRadio.com But I did a game slipcover and backcover for Silent Hill, the movie, the game.

38
00:02:22,465 --> 00:02:25,486
[SPEAKER_01]: The irony is that I was doing a game based off a movie, based off a game.

39
00:02:25,726 --> 00:02:27,607
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that like Street Fighter II, the movie, the game?

40
00:02:28,127 --> 00:02:29,067
[SPEAKER_01]: Except it doesn't suck ass.

41
00:02:30,575 --> 00:02:31,656
[SPEAKER_05]: But this is not a real game.

42
00:02:31,716 --> 00:02:32,676
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's just get that clear.

43
00:02:32,696 --> 00:02:33,497
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not a real game.

44
00:02:33,517 --> 00:02:40,461
[SPEAKER_01]: But our illustrator project was to either do a CD, like music CD or game CD.

45
00:02:41,242 --> 00:02:43,063
[SPEAKER_01]: So I picked Silent Hill the Movie the Game.

46
00:02:43,163 --> 00:02:45,104
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm telling you, you need to do that poster project.

47
00:02:45,164 --> 00:02:47,686
[SPEAKER_05]: You should take that concept and make it like a poster.

48
00:02:48,447 --> 00:02:48,747
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what?

49
00:02:49,107 --> 00:02:49,527
[SPEAKER_05]: Hell with it.

50
00:02:49,567 --> 00:02:50,828
[SPEAKER_05]: Just send that in as your poster.

51
00:02:51,308 --> 00:02:52,149
[SPEAKER_05]: See what happens.

52
00:02:52,189 --> 00:02:53,170
[SPEAKER_05]: You never know what might happen.

53
00:02:53,550 --> 00:02:55,091
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd have to do a whole lot more to it.

54
00:02:55,331 --> 00:02:57,733
[SPEAKER_01]: However, it did give me some ideas for the poster.

55
00:02:57,773 --> 00:02:58,213
[SPEAKER_01]: So perhaps...

56
00:02:58,968 --> 00:02:59,869
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll make a project of that.

57
00:02:59,889 --> 00:03:02,710
[SPEAKER_05]: Get that done, though, because the deadline's fast approaching.

58
00:03:03,291 --> 00:03:03,511
[SPEAKER_01]: I know.

59
00:03:03,711 --> 00:03:06,033
[SPEAKER_05]: Anything else you've been playing this week?

60
00:03:07,814 --> 00:03:09,555
[SPEAKER_05]: No Silent Hill 3, no Sexy Dean?

61
00:03:09,595 --> 00:03:15,559
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, because all I did was work on my final projects for the first half of the week.

62
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:21,763
[SPEAKER_01]: I honestly have not had time, but however, now that school's let out, I do have more time to play games.

63
00:03:21,883 --> 00:03:26,546
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm actually hunting down my Silent Hill 3 strategy guide right now because I need the map for the level I'm in.

64
00:03:26,826 --> 00:03:27,606
[SPEAKER_05]: Very nice.

65
00:03:27,627 --> 00:03:28,347
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm still in the hospital.

66
00:03:28,786 --> 00:03:30,307
[SPEAKER_05]: I do have to ask an Animal Crossing question.

67
00:03:30,327 --> 00:03:35,851
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't want to go into Animal Crossing ad nauseum again this week, but didn't you say there was a baby lost in your village?

68
00:03:36,412 --> 00:03:39,374
[SPEAKER_05]: Didn't you sell the baby to Tom Nook or something for bells?

69
00:03:39,594 --> 00:03:46,019
[SPEAKER_01]: I wanted to sell the baby to Crazy Red to sell on the black market, but he wasn't there, and so Loki rescued him and brought him back to his mommy.

70
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:47,700
[SPEAKER_05]: That's very nice.

71
00:03:48,301 --> 00:03:48,961
[SPEAKER_01]: Good to hear.

72
00:03:49,261 --> 00:03:51,023
[SPEAKER_01]: But I did sell some furniture.

73
00:03:52,984 --> 00:03:54,345
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki, how was your gaming week?

74
00:03:54,926 --> 00:03:56,447
[SPEAKER_04]: My gaming week was diverse.

75
00:03:57,588 --> 00:03:57,988
[SPEAKER_04]: I played...

76
00:03:58,678 --> 00:04:02,561
[SPEAKER_04]: Some Animal Crossing, Grand Theft Auto Liberty City Stories, Five Player Deathmatches

77
00:04:19,082 --> 00:04:19,663
[SPEAKER_05]: Call of Duty 2 Deathmatches

78
00:04:35,393 --> 00:04:36,594
[SPEAKER_04]: And that game's actually really cool.

79
00:04:36,854 --> 00:04:38,234
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm very pleased with it.

80
00:04:38,694 --> 00:04:40,375
[SPEAKER_04]: I haven't played much Perfect Dark.

81
00:04:40,655 --> 00:04:41,816
[SPEAKER_04]: Did play a little bit of Cameo.

82
00:04:41,956 --> 00:04:43,396
[SPEAKER_04]: That was really cool.

83
00:04:43,996 --> 00:04:44,797
[SPEAKER_04]: Still pretty easy.

84
00:04:45,397 --> 00:04:48,958
[SPEAKER_04]: But overall, decent game for a launch, I guess.

85
00:04:49,179 --> 00:04:50,419
[SPEAKER_04]: What does Cameo really like?

86
00:04:50,599 --> 00:04:51,479
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a platform game.

87
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:52,600
[SPEAKER_05]: What does that mean?

88
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:55,181
[SPEAKER_05]: Does it mean like a Crash Bandicoot type of game, or what?

89
00:04:56,522 --> 00:04:56,982
[SPEAKER_05]: Spyro?

90
00:04:57,182 --> 00:04:59,383
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a platform game.

91
00:04:59,403 --> 00:05:04,545
[SPEAKER_04]: Basically a lot of jumping, figuring out puzzles, killing things, and...

92
00:05:05,513 --> 00:05:15,124
[SPEAKER_04]: Not really much in the collecting stuff, but it's just kind of your normal, you know, like Mario 64 minus all the, you know... Okay, I gotcha, I gotcha.

93
00:05:16,345 --> 00:05:18,848
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, I did have one thing to add that's related to Loki's week.

94
00:05:19,008 --> 00:05:19,309
[SPEAKER_05]: What's that?

95
00:05:19,469 --> 00:05:20,670
[SPEAKER_01]: He gave me Papa Lucros.

96
00:05:21,551 --> 00:05:22,292
[SPEAKER_05]: Ah, for the PSP.

97
00:05:22,352 --> 00:05:24,014
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm going to be playing the hell out of it.

98
00:05:24,134 --> 00:05:26,757
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, well then I expect a full review next week, young lady.

99
00:05:27,767 --> 00:05:28,989
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, ow.

100
00:05:29,129 --> 00:05:31,273
[SPEAKER_01]: I sucked my thumb out and I popped my elbow.

101
00:05:31,534 --> 00:05:32,976
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, if only we were TV sometimes.

102
00:05:33,037 --> 00:05:35,501
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, anything else, Loki?

103
00:05:35,622 --> 00:05:36,583
[SPEAKER_04]: Other than that, no.

104
00:05:36,864 --> 00:05:38,327
[SPEAKER_04]: I haven't planned anything else.

105
00:05:39,278 --> 00:05:44,043
[SPEAKER_05]: I will not be talking about Animal Crossing this week in my gaming week because Animal Crossing got the boot from my DS.

106
00:05:44,083 --> 00:05:44,523
[SPEAKER_05]: Actually, it didn't.

107
00:05:44,563 --> 00:05:54,714
[SPEAKER_05]: It's still sitting there in the top slot, but it's sitting there completely unloved because a new game went into the bottom slot on my DS, and that was Final Fantasy IV Advance I picked up earlier this week.

108
00:05:55,575 --> 00:05:57,277
[SPEAKER_05]: I have not stopped playing it since I got it.

109
00:05:57,377 --> 00:05:57,737
[SPEAKER_05]: And I...

110
00:05:58,598 --> 00:05:59,379
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

111
00:06:15,642 --> 00:06:16,883
[SPEAKER_05]: I really haven't played through it since.

112
00:06:16,963 --> 00:06:28,151
[SPEAKER_05]: I touched on it a little bit when I was on PlayStation in the Final Fantasy Chronicles pack that came out, but I never really got super into it because I couldn't stay on the loading times before the battle, even though it was bad enough.

113
00:06:29,633 --> 00:06:33,535
[SPEAKER_05]: But now, since there are no loading times on this, it's so awesome.

114
00:06:33,876 --> 00:06:40,320
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm rediscovering this classic, classic game, and Final Fantasy IV is a classic title.

115
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:42,482
[SPEAKER_05]: If you are into role-playing games in any form,

116
00:06:42,898 --> 00:06:54,874
[SPEAKER_05]: you must respect what this game did for future role playing games it is a must play game if you did not play through it before now I'm sure a lot of folks are thinking well what the hell makes this worth buying again if I already had this before

117
00:06:55,646 --> 00:07:09,433
[SPEAKER_05]: and the answer is that the script, which right there ought to sell this because if you played Final Fantasy 2 on Super Nintendo with the original translation, the nice thing is they kept that line intact as a throwback to the fans.

118
00:07:09,593 --> 00:07:12,155
[SPEAKER_05]: It's still you Spoonie Bard because I've gotten through that part of the game.

119
00:07:12,455 --> 00:07:14,336
[SPEAKER_05]: I've put in like five or six hours on that game.

120
00:07:14,736 --> 00:07:18,418
[SPEAKER_05]: Cecil's already a pallet and I'm already like, I've played that game a lot, okay?

121
00:07:18,438 --> 00:07:19,459
[SPEAKER_05]: That's been my week pretty much.

122
00:07:21,471 --> 00:07:28,218
[SPEAKER_05]: But they changed the script to put all the emotion and words and story really back into the game.

123
00:07:28,258 --> 00:07:37,767
[SPEAKER_05]: It's kind of like before, you just had from point A to point B. You had the words that got you from point A to point B, but now it's really fleshed out and the story carries more emotion.

124
00:07:38,127 --> 00:07:43,573
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's amazing when you consider this 2D game is emotional, but it's great.

125
00:07:43,693 --> 00:07:44,634
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't say enough things about it.

126
00:07:45,014 --> 00:07:45,554
[SPEAKER_05]: They put...

127
00:07:46,491 --> 00:07:49,354
[SPEAKER_05]: All the original moves back into it.

128
00:07:49,394 --> 00:07:56,340
[SPEAKER_05]: So a lot of folks, like, you know when you go and you become a paladin for the first time, you have to fight yourself as a Dark Knight.

129
00:07:56,380 --> 00:08:01,165
[SPEAKER_05]: But when you first played it on the Super Nintendo, the Dark Knight did a move, like he did this wavy beam move.

130
00:08:01,185 --> 00:08:02,326
[SPEAKER_05]: And you're like, what the hell?

131
00:08:02,546 --> 00:08:03,707
[SPEAKER_05]: How come I couldn't do that before?

132
00:08:04,007 --> 00:08:05,288
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, now you can.

133
00:08:05,389 --> 00:08:08,111
[SPEAKER_05]: They put that move back in because that was in the original Japanese game.

134
00:08:08,151 --> 00:08:08,852
[SPEAKER_05]: You can do that again.

135
00:08:09,172 --> 00:08:11,174
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's great because they put all these old moves back in.

136
00:08:11,903 --> 00:08:14,104
[SPEAKER_05]: and the game is 14 years old.

137
00:08:14,144 --> 00:08:16,926
[SPEAKER_05]: You probably haven't touched this game in a long time.

138
00:08:17,006 --> 00:08:23,771
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe you have through the use of emulators but I'm betting 95% of the people that listen to this show and play Final Fantasy 2 haven't touched it in the 14 years since.

139
00:08:24,431 --> 00:08:25,992
[SPEAKER_05]: Now's the time to go back and rediscover it.

140
00:08:26,432 --> 00:08:29,694
[SPEAKER_05]: And I know a lot of people are saying why the hell didn't they do this sooner?

141
00:08:30,115 --> 00:08:32,856
[SPEAKER_05]: Why didn't they put this on the Game Boy Advance when the Advance was first out?

142
00:08:32,976 --> 00:08:33,317
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

143
00:08:33,337 --> 00:08:34,137
[SPEAKER_05]: They probably should have.

144
00:08:34,437 --> 00:08:35,238
[SPEAKER_05]: But when you think about it

145
00:08:36,061 --> 00:08:36,642
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

146
00:08:48,806 --> 00:08:51,367
[SPEAKER_05]: Final Fantasy 4 and the awesome game that it is.

147
00:08:51,827 --> 00:08:52,647
[SPEAKER_05]: And now is the chance.

148
00:08:52,707 --> 00:08:54,547
[SPEAKER_05]: And I say seize that opportunity.

149
00:08:54,627 --> 00:08:56,448
[SPEAKER_05]: I give this game my highest recommendation.

150
00:08:56,768 --> 00:09:01,289
[SPEAKER_05]: It is a must play game if you are into role playing games in any capacity.

151
00:09:01,369 --> 00:09:03,190
[SPEAKER_05]: Even if you aren't, you need to give this one a try.

152
00:09:03,310 --> 00:09:07,391
[SPEAKER_04]: Besides, even if you're thinking about it, what else is there to buy that's coming out this month?

153
00:09:08,131 --> 00:09:08,631
[SPEAKER_04]: Gauntlet?

154
00:09:10,820 --> 00:09:11,980
[SPEAKER_05]: I played Gauntlet at E3.

155
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,301
[SPEAKER_05]: It looks okay, but you know what?

156
00:09:14,381 --> 00:09:16,241
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't care about anything else until I beat Final Fantasy 4.

157
00:09:16,341 --> 00:09:16,681
[SPEAKER_05]: And you know what?

158
00:09:16,701 --> 00:09:18,282
[SPEAKER_05]: For the next two weeks, you're probably going to hear me saying this.

159
00:09:18,362 --> 00:09:19,162
[SPEAKER_05]: All I played was Final Fantasy 4.

160
00:09:19,762 --> 00:09:20,882
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry, I have to do this.

161
00:09:21,222 --> 00:09:22,503
[SPEAKER_05]: This is my childhood coming back.

162
00:09:22,583 --> 00:09:27,364
[SPEAKER_01]: To ask you, do you know if it's a port of the WonderSwan version?

163
00:09:28,924 --> 00:09:31,284
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know, because I don't know enough about the WonderSwan version.

164
00:09:31,304 --> 00:09:33,925
[SPEAKER_05]: I can tell you that it is not easy type.

165
00:09:34,285 --> 00:09:38,366
[SPEAKER_05]: It is the original Japanese, because you can...

166
00:09:39,761 --> 00:09:43,362
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry, you don't have a heal potion, you have like the gold needle, the maiden's kiss.

167
00:09:43,682 --> 00:09:44,582
[SPEAKER_05]: Everything is split up like that.

168
00:09:45,082 --> 00:09:46,862
[SPEAKER_05]: Palom and Porom you will be able to bring back.

169
00:09:46,902 --> 00:09:50,283
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the other big catch about this game is that you can switch your characters now.

170
00:09:50,343 --> 00:09:57,624
[SPEAKER_05]: Later in the game, any character that disappeared you couldn't use in the final Zero Mist battle, Edward, Palom, Porom, Yang, you get to bring them all back.

171
00:09:57,664 --> 00:10:00,105
[SPEAKER_05]: They'll be in Mysidia waiting for you to switch out.

172
00:10:00,445 --> 00:10:02,205
[SPEAKER_05]: And apparently there's two new dungeons as well.

173
00:10:02,245 --> 00:10:03,345
[SPEAKER_05]: I haven't even gotten to that point yet.

174
00:10:03,365 --> 00:10:05,206
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm giddy about getting to that point.

175
00:10:05,326 --> 00:10:05,826
[SPEAKER_05]: That's pretty cool.

176
00:10:07,006 --> 00:10:27,718
[SPEAKER_05]: is I remember um because you remember when I was back in my my WonderSwan everything oh yeah oh yeah WonderSwan was I I don't know why they never tried that here but well maybe because Nintendo's so dominating I don't know well I picked up the Final Fantasy the first one the WonderSwan package let's back up a minute because I'm betting that probably a good portion of our listeners don't even know what the hell a WonderSwan is what is a WonderSwan

177
00:10:28,251 --> 00:10:30,853
[SPEAKER_01]: It was Bandai's handheld system.

178
00:10:31,253 --> 00:10:38,977
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, just to point out something, if anyone's ever seen the Street Fighter OAV anime, the one with Sakura and everything, at the end of it, she's playing Street Fighter on a regular WonderSwan.

179
00:10:39,618 --> 00:10:41,279
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a point of reference.

180
00:10:41,299 --> 00:10:43,100
[SPEAKER_05]: But it was not released here in the U.S.

181
00:10:43,140 --> 00:10:43,900
[SPEAKER_05]: It was only in Japan.

182
00:10:44,020 --> 00:10:52,125
[SPEAKER_01]: Right, and when Dan and I found out that we were releasing the first Final Fantasy with a special limited edition WonderSwan, we was like, okay, that's ours.

183
00:10:52,445 --> 00:10:55,247
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought the WonderSwan came out over here very limited.

184
00:10:55,487 --> 00:10:57,448
[SPEAKER_01]: No, that was Neo Geo Pocket Color that we got.

185
00:10:57,825 --> 00:10:58,745
[SPEAKER_04]: No, there was something else.

186
00:10:59,226 --> 00:11:00,966
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe it was Tiger Electronics' thing.

187
00:11:00,986 --> 00:11:02,487
[SPEAKER_04]: They had a portable system, I thought.

188
00:11:02,747 --> 00:11:07,629
[SPEAKER_05]: Regardless, even if it did come out in some limited capacity, I'm betting half our listeners don't even know of its existence.

189
00:11:08,289 --> 00:11:10,691
[SPEAKER_01]: The good Digimon games were on WonderSwan.

190
00:11:11,391 --> 00:11:13,792
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, Rockman and Bass were on...

191
00:11:14,696 --> 00:11:15,437
[SPEAKER_01]: The old WonderSwan.

192
00:11:15,837 --> 00:11:17,279
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's a WonderSwan Crystal out now.

193
00:11:17,699 --> 00:11:23,786
[SPEAKER_05]: So in fact, Final Fantasy 1 and 2 on Game Boy Advance are pretty much just the WonderSwan versions with some minor tweaks.

194
00:11:23,806 --> 00:11:25,688
[SPEAKER_01]: 1, 2, and 4 came out on WonderSwan.

195
00:11:25,708 --> 00:11:29,332
[SPEAKER_01]: They did not bring out 3, which pissed me off so much because that was the one I wanted.

196
00:11:29,792 --> 00:11:32,095
[SPEAKER_01]: It was the first one with the job change system.

197
00:11:32,155 --> 00:11:32,736
[SPEAKER_05]: Right, right.

198
00:11:32,756 --> 00:11:33,737
[SPEAKER_01]: Which is what I love about 5.

199
00:11:33,797 --> 00:11:36,380
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the one that they're going back and tweaking really bad for the DS.

200
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:42,115
[SPEAKER_05]: and Rumor is that if Final Fantasy IV Advanced sells well, which I think it will, V and VI are pretty much a given.

201
00:11:42,155 --> 00:11:44,702
[SPEAKER_05]: In fact, I thought I read somewhere they're already working on VI.

202
00:11:45,635 --> 00:11:53,763
[SPEAKER_01]: We went back and played 5 on PS2, although I had already been playing an emulated version and I had actually been playing it in Japanese for a little while too.

203
00:11:54,444 --> 00:12:04,333
[SPEAKER_01]: But the good thing about the first one on WonderSwan is that because most of it was in Hiragana, I could sort of read what was going on.

204
00:12:04,734 --> 00:12:07,757
[SPEAKER_01]: I could at least read the spells and I could read the materials, which was easy enough.

205
00:12:08,857 --> 00:12:12,158
[SPEAKER_01]: But it was so pretty and the music was so good.

206
00:12:12,218 --> 00:12:13,479
[SPEAKER_01]: They had completely redone it.

207
00:12:13,919 --> 00:12:17,200
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know that 4 was given the same treatment.

208
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:23,362
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm wondering... 4, they went back and did, at least on advance, they went back and did some of the graphics.

209
00:12:23,402 --> 00:12:25,162
[SPEAKER_05]: Some of the sprites are cleaned up a little bit.

210
00:12:25,663 --> 00:12:29,824
[SPEAKER_05]: But the music, really, I don't notice that much of a change.

211
00:12:29,884 --> 00:12:32,605
[SPEAKER_05]: It is different, but only slight in some of the instrumentation.

212
00:12:32,985 --> 00:12:34,905
[SPEAKER_05]: To me, I don't notice the difference.

213
00:12:35,005 --> 00:12:36,626
[SPEAKER_05]: But somebody very picky will notice it.

214
00:12:36,926 --> 00:12:45,112
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, also there's the difference between the MIDI synthesizers on the NES and what we got that have to have done it closer to the original.

215
00:12:45,752 --> 00:12:48,174
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, when you're talking about NES versus Advance, yes.

216
00:12:48,214 --> 00:12:51,497
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'm talking about the Famicom versus NES.

217
00:12:51,677 --> 00:12:52,277
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, oh, yeah, yeah.

218
00:12:52,297 --> 00:12:54,779
[SPEAKER_01]: The instrumentation could have very likely been different on the Japanese one.

219
00:12:54,799 --> 00:12:55,680
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely, absolutely.

220
00:12:56,660 --> 00:12:58,422
[SPEAKER_05]: Ooh, that's a lot of Final Fantasy geekery.

221
00:12:58,462 --> 00:12:59,703
[SPEAKER_05]: We better move on to other topics.

222
00:12:59,903 --> 00:13:00,183
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

223
00:13:00,583 --> 00:13:01,063
[SPEAKER_05]: That's all right.

224
00:13:01,083 --> 00:13:02,144
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, that was fun, though.

225
00:13:02,685 --> 00:13:05,867
[SPEAKER_05]: We haven't talked about the WonderSwan yet in like 50 episodes of Orange Lounge, so.

226
00:13:06,209 --> 00:13:06,870
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll bring it one day.

227
00:13:32,538 --> 00:13:36,340
[SPEAKER_01]: Sega is actually coming out with two games for the handheld systems.

228
00:13:36,940 --> 00:13:39,261
[SPEAKER_01]: There's one on the PSP, one on the GBA.

229
00:13:39,881 --> 00:13:43,783
[SPEAKER_01]: The PSP title doesn't have a name yet, but it's being done by Totally Games.

230
00:13:44,484 --> 00:13:48,605
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the studio that did X-Wing vs. TIE Fighter, Secret Weapons Over Normandy.

231
00:13:49,906 --> 00:13:51,547
[SPEAKER_01]: Yay.

232
00:13:52,307 --> 00:13:59,951
[SPEAKER_01]: There's also... They're saying, though, that it's a classic game that they're trying to bring back.

233
00:13:59,991 --> 00:14:00,491
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm wondering...

234
00:14:01,593 --> 00:14:02,874
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly which one it's going to be.

235
00:14:03,755 --> 00:14:05,897
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's been nothing really official listed as the title.

236
00:14:06,917 --> 00:14:10,440
[SPEAKER_05]: To the Sega gods, if you happen to be listening, Echo the Dolphin, please.

237
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:14,143
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know why that comes to my mind, but I would like to see that come back.

238
00:14:14,163 --> 00:14:17,666
[SPEAKER_01]: The last Echo game we got was on Dreamcast, and it was kind of... It was kind of poop?

239
00:14:18,507 --> 00:14:19,287
[SPEAKER_01]: Not really poop.

240
00:14:19,667 --> 00:14:23,030
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually didn't get to play much of it, but it was... I never really saw it.

241
00:14:23,591 --> 00:14:25,472
[SPEAKER_01]: I heard that it got sort of eh results.

242
00:14:25,652 --> 00:14:26,673
[SPEAKER_05]: How about ToeJam & Earl?

243
00:14:26,693 --> 00:14:28,034
[SPEAKER_05]: That would be kind of cool, too.

244
00:14:28,054 --> 00:14:28,354
[SPEAKER_05]: No, please.

245
00:14:28,535 --> 00:14:28,995
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, come on.

246
00:14:30,379 --> 00:14:32,981
[SPEAKER_05]: They did a ToeJam & Earl 2, but it was poopy, wasn't it?

247
00:14:33,602 --> 00:14:34,322
[SPEAKER_05]: Vectorman!

248
00:14:34,342 --> 00:14:35,603
[SPEAKER_01]: We need Vectorman back!

249
00:14:36,004 --> 00:14:36,244
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway.

250
00:14:36,724 --> 00:14:40,987
[SPEAKER_01]: No, the other one... Oh, actually, there is a little bit more on this.

251
00:14:41,108 --> 00:14:45,831
[SPEAKER_01]: The game was described as a run-and-gun blast-a-thon, quote.

252
00:14:45,891 --> 00:14:48,713
[SPEAKER_01]: It actually makes references to Robotron and Smash TV.

253
00:14:50,395 --> 00:14:51,155
[SPEAKER_01]: More money!

254
00:14:51,316 --> 00:14:52,036
[SPEAKER_01]: More prizes!

255
00:14:52,436 --> 00:14:53,077
[SPEAKER_01]: I love it!

256
00:14:54,664 --> 00:15:00,466
[SPEAKER_01]: The next one is the Tower SP Game Boy exclusive from Vivarium.

257
00:15:01,786 --> 00:15:10,548
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to be quoted as an in-depth sim experience as you design, manage, build everyday running of a skyscraper.

258
00:15:11,749 --> 00:15:16,170
[SPEAKER_01]: You can build a basement or a luxury or...

259
00:15:16,937 --> 00:15:17,277
[SPEAKER_01]: and so on.

260
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:45,862
[SPEAKER_04]: Smash TV did get a lot of play in my house lately, like in the last week.

261
00:16:05,709 --> 00:16:06,771
[SPEAKER_05]: Isn't that weird?

262
00:16:08,413 --> 00:16:19,848
[SPEAKER_05]: Some of the most talked about Xbox 360 things right now is old shit, like Smash TV, and not so much that Geometry Wars is old shit, but it's pretty shit that you could do on...

263
00:16:20,909 --> 00:16:24,011
[SPEAKER_05]: Old-style consoles, probably, but yet it's so cool and pretty.

264
00:16:24,151 --> 00:16:24,472
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

265
00:16:24,532 --> 00:16:25,813
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like updated asteroids.

266
00:16:26,173 --> 00:16:27,114
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know how to explain it.

267
00:16:27,834 --> 00:16:29,495
[SPEAKER_01]: But back to Sega.

268
00:16:29,875 --> 00:16:30,076
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry.

269
00:16:31,016 --> 00:16:33,918
[SPEAKER_01]: The PSP title, there's not any release date yet.

270
00:16:34,038 --> 00:16:37,080
[SPEAKER_01]: However, the Tower SP is slated for March 2006 release.

271
00:16:39,198 --> 00:16:40,699
[SPEAKER_05]: The Family Entertainment Protection Act

272
00:16:56,305 --> 00:16:59,510
[SPEAKER_05]: Just to follow up, it is now officially before Congress.

273
00:17:00,251 --> 00:17:03,656
[SPEAKER_05]: Granted, it'll probably be one of the first things they pick up when Congress goes back into session.

274
00:17:03,736 --> 00:17:06,320
[SPEAKER_05]: So you'll see some fun debates about this.

275
00:17:06,801 --> 00:17:11,168
[SPEAKER_05]: If you have a very strong position one way or the other on this, I urge you to write.

276
00:17:11,448 --> 00:17:12,109
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for watching!

277
00:17:29,830 --> 00:17:31,511
[SPEAKER_05]: Have a friend proofread it if you're not sure.

278
00:17:32,452 --> 00:17:37,256
[SPEAKER_05]: In other law news, an Alabama judge has said this is denied.

279
00:17:37,376 --> 00:17:42,740
[SPEAKER_05]: It was a lawsuit filed against Take-Two by families of police officers.

280
00:17:43,761 --> 00:17:54,749
[SPEAKER_05]: It was Grand Theft Auto inspired, basically, saying that Grand Theft Auto inspired these kids to kill the cops in the family's suit, Take-Two.

281
00:17:55,310 --> 00:17:56,130
[SPEAKER_05]: It got thrown out.

282
00:17:58,103 --> 00:18:08,787
[SPEAKER_05]: Kind of interesting, Alabama's kind of the home of all this stuff lately because wasn't that also where Jack Thompson's right to practice law kind of got booted out or something?

283
00:18:08,807 --> 00:18:09,187
[SPEAKER_05]: Guess what?

284
00:18:09,667 --> 00:18:10,888
[SPEAKER_05]: This was the same judge.

285
00:18:12,668 --> 00:18:14,169
[SPEAKER_05]: Same judge, Judge James Moore.

286
00:18:14,849 --> 00:18:16,610
[SPEAKER_05]: He must be the only judge in Alabama, I don't know.

287
00:18:16,890 --> 00:18:17,970
[SPEAKER_01]: Bless my home state.

288
00:18:17,990 --> 00:18:22,111
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what's funny is hearing Judge James Moore makes me think of Jay Moore.

289
00:18:22,692 --> 00:18:23,652
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a funny thought.

290
00:18:24,349 --> 00:18:25,471
[SPEAKER_05]: Give this guy a TV show.

291
00:18:25,491 --> 00:18:26,954
[SPEAKER_05]: This is the judge I want to see on TV.

292
00:18:26,994 --> 00:18:31,122
[SPEAKER_01]: He absolutely gets major kudos for me.

293
00:18:31,222 --> 00:18:33,146
[SPEAKER_01]: It makes me proud to be an Alabamian.

294
00:18:34,088 --> 00:18:34,368
Yep.

295
00:18:34,809 --> 00:18:35,591
[SPEAKER_01]: Makes my heart hurt.

296
00:18:37,283 --> 00:18:38,984
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, let's move on.

297
00:18:39,344 --> 00:18:41,705
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki, what do you got for us tonight?

298
00:18:42,125 --> 00:18:43,305
[SPEAKER_05]: Talk to me a little bit about 360.

299
00:18:43,705 --> 00:18:44,125
[SPEAKER_05]: Tell us about 360.

300
00:18:44,546 --> 00:18:49,447
[SPEAKER_05]: First off, I know this wasn't on your list, but what happened with the Best Buy thing?

301
00:18:49,487 --> 00:18:53,489
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, there was the list on the internet that said that all these Best Buys are going to have the game.

302
00:18:53,529 --> 00:18:53,989
[SPEAKER_05]: What happened?

303
00:18:54,069 --> 00:18:58,250
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, the whole drama behind the Best Buy thing is this basically was like a second launch.

304
00:18:58,290 --> 00:19:03,572
[SPEAKER_04]: There was supposed to be about 300,000 units being sent throughout the entire United States.

305
00:19:04,682 --> 00:19:07,083
[SPEAKER_04]: So, same kind of allocations they were getting before.

306
00:19:08,424 --> 00:19:10,745
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, here are the rules for this.

307
00:19:11,205 --> 00:19:13,486
[SPEAKER_04]: They were receiving their shipments on Friday.

308
00:19:13,506 --> 00:19:17,008
[SPEAKER_04]: They were supposed to hold them for Sunday for their sale that was going to be advertised.

309
00:19:17,028 --> 00:19:18,368
[SPEAKER_04]: They were not to pre-sell them.

310
00:19:18,748 --> 00:19:19,889
[SPEAKER_04]: They were not to open early.

311
00:19:21,701 --> 00:19:22,461
[SPEAKER_04]: Did they follow that?

312
00:19:22,561 --> 00:19:22,761
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

313
00:19:23,001 --> 00:19:27,203
[SPEAKER_04]: They sold them early, they opened early, people were disappointed.

314
00:19:27,343 --> 00:19:30,383
[SPEAKER_05]: When you say they select stores, because we can't pinpoint who did it.

315
00:19:30,403 --> 00:19:38,446
[SPEAKER_04]: Select stores opened early and sold early, and so people were camping in line, and from what I hear too, some stores didn't even get them.

316
00:19:38,926 --> 00:19:43,187
[SPEAKER_04]: And so people were camping in line, and they get up there, oh, by the way, they're sold out.

317
00:19:43,507 --> 00:19:45,608
[SPEAKER_04]: Would you like a compact laptop instead?

318
00:19:46,128 --> 00:19:50,369
[SPEAKER_04]: So it was basically a lot of, you know, crap that

319
00:19:51,345 --> 00:19:51,985
[SPEAKER_04]: Hit the fan.

320
00:19:52,926 --> 00:19:53,706
[SPEAKER_04]: It wasn't pretty.

321
00:19:53,946 --> 00:19:57,768
[SPEAKER_04]: And a lot of people waited in line and some of them did get them.

322
00:19:58,248 --> 00:19:59,169
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of people did not.

323
00:19:59,489 --> 00:20:02,551
[SPEAKER_04]: People still pissed at Microsoft.

324
00:20:02,971 --> 00:20:08,413
[SPEAKER_04]: But this is going to happen all over again because apparently another shipment is coming in on the 22nd.

325
00:20:09,674 --> 00:20:10,134
[SPEAKER_05]: Interesting.

326
00:20:10,995 --> 00:20:13,716
[SPEAKER_04]: So, yeah, it's pretty bad.

327
00:20:13,796 --> 00:20:15,497
[SPEAKER_04]: But, you know...

328
00:20:16,761 --> 00:20:18,203
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for watching!

329
00:20:38,334 --> 00:20:39,695
[SPEAKER_04]: Death or Alive Death or Alive

330
00:21:00,422 --> 00:21:02,665
[SPEAKER_04]: to launch that people were really looking forward to.

331
00:21:02,725 --> 00:21:05,548
[SPEAKER_04]: Ridge Racer was the top game for the Japanese market.

332
00:21:05,988 --> 00:21:12,875
[SPEAKER_04]: And then, of course, their RPGs like 99 Nights, well, sort of a Dynasty Warriors type game.

333
00:21:13,156 --> 00:21:18,641
[SPEAKER_04]: And then Enchanted Arm, the really big RPGs, they aren't coming out until next year.

334
00:21:20,263 --> 00:21:20,684
[SPEAKER_04]: So it sucks.

335
00:21:22,311 --> 00:21:23,711
[SPEAKER_05]: What else is going on in 360 News?

336
00:21:24,352 --> 00:21:31,793
[SPEAKER_04]: Other than that, they do have some really cool stuff that they've added to the Xbox Live Marketplace, which is really good.

337
00:21:31,933 --> 00:21:34,993
[SPEAKER_04]: Some new content, new cars to download for Ridge Racer 6.

338
00:21:36,074 --> 00:21:36,974
[SPEAKER_04]: Those are all free.

339
00:21:37,774 --> 00:21:48,776
[SPEAKER_04]: They're going to actually be adding a demo for Full Auto coming pretty soon, I think in this week or so, and I'm really looking forward to that, which is going to be awesome.

340
00:21:49,508 --> 00:21:55,653
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, I read about this, and I thought this sounded pretty cool, that the Xbox 360 is actually having a high-definition trailer for Mission Impossible 3.

341
00:21:56,454 --> 00:21:59,356
[SPEAKER_05]: It's available on the Xbox Live Marketplace, and you can download this.

342
00:21:59,416 --> 00:22:03,879
[SPEAKER_05]: It's some type of exclusive trailer thing that you can download.

343
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:04,800
[SPEAKER_05]: Very interesting.

344
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:11,846
[SPEAKER_05]: Kind of buys into that whole, the 360 and the next-gen systems may be more than a gaming system.

345
00:22:12,366 --> 00:22:13,187
[SPEAKER_04]: They're trying.

346
00:22:13,487 --> 00:22:14,968
[SPEAKER_04]: They did that with Narnia.

347
00:22:15,068 --> 00:22:17,050
[SPEAKER_04]: They had a trailer for Narnia on there and stuff.

348
00:22:18,011 --> 00:22:20,292
[SPEAKER_04]: I've seen the Mission Impossible 3 trailer.

349
00:22:20,332 --> 00:22:21,973
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just a teaser, and it's like, eh.

350
00:22:22,574 --> 00:22:23,194
[SPEAKER_05]: But think about that.

351
00:22:23,234 --> 00:22:28,138
[SPEAKER_05]: If you can download the trailer on the marketplace, what's to stop them later on from offering movies for download on the marketplace?

352
00:22:28,158 --> 00:22:28,858
[SPEAKER_05]: True, they could.

353
00:22:28,998 --> 00:22:31,780
[SPEAKER_05]: I see that as a logical next step for what the system's going to do.

354
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:33,221
[SPEAKER_05]: And Sony, same thing.

355
00:22:34,582 --> 00:22:35,203
[SPEAKER_04]: I wouldn't doubt it.

356
00:22:35,503 --> 00:22:36,784
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it makes sense.

357
00:22:37,697 --> 00:22:41,098
[SPEAKER_04]: And I really do like the way they have the games online for free download.

358
00:22:41,218 --> 00:22:42,278
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, that's really good.

359
00:22:42,318 --> 00:22:43,639
[SPEAKER_04]: They try out the demos and stuff.

360
00:22:44,259 --> 00:22:48,380
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's great, and it'll really help them sell their games.

361
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:50,920
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a really good tool that they have on there.

362
00:22:51,201 --> 00:22:53,181
[SPEAKER_04]: And plus, the extra content is really awesome.

363
00:22:54,301 --> 00:22:56,402
[SPEAKER_04]: I do like the fact that they have downloadable stuff.

364
00:22:56,742 --> 00:22:59,883
[SPEAKER_04]: Plus, you can pay for other things, like they have some extra sound...

365
00:23:01,138 --> 00:23:02,720
[SPEAKER_04]: Music Tracks for Ridge Racer

366
00:23:21,637 --> 00:23:25,238
[SPEAKER_04]: The first one was this one entitled the Extreme Edition.

367
00:23:25,578 --> 00:23:32,601
[SPEAKER_04]: Basically, they've done a red paint job on it, added a nice little window to it, and changed all the LEDs to red, which looks pretty cool.

368
00:23:32,681 --> 00:23:36,762
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's actually being sold on eBay for thousands of dollars.

369
00:23:37,963 --> 00:23:45,925
[SPEAKER_04]: Then the other one, which is less practical and less cool, would be a 360 being put inside of an Atari 2600.

370
00:23:46,005 --> 00:23:48,806
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, I think that's pretty cool.

371
00:23:49,446 --> 00:23:50,927
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, you have to see it

372
00:23:51,351 --> 00:23:53,472
[SPEAKER_04]: To understand how... It looks ugly.

373
00:23:53,812 --> 00:23:54,293
[SPEAKER_05]: Ugly as hell.

374
00:23:54,533 --> 00:23:56,114
[SPEAKER_04]: It is pretty damn ugly.

375
00:23:57,094 --> 00:24:01,437
[SPEAKER_04]: But, you know, hey, give people time, they'll put it in anything.

376
00:24:01,457 --> 00:24:07,760
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't praise the modding community enough, but damn, they can be creative sometimes.

377
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:08,300
[SPEAKER_05]: Seriously.

378
00:24:08,380 --> 00:24:12,103
[SPEAKER_05]: Not just... Just the modding and cracking and hacking scene in general.

379
00:24:12,203 --> 00:24:15,084
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, damn, there's some creative things people come up with.

380
00:24:15,144 --> 00:24:16,945
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like, why the hell would you do that?

381
00:24:17,265 --> 00:24:18,646
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I can.

382
00:24:19,567 --> 00:24:20,087
[SPEAKER_05]: Exactly.

383
00:24:21,587 --> 00:24:22,488
[SPEAKER_05]: Why would you put a 360 in the 2600?

384
00:24:44,389 --> 00:24:53,475
[SPEAKER_05]: Microsoft in both America and Japan has not announced anything regarding the possibility of a next generation DVD drive being placed in the Xbox 360.

385
00:24:53,515 --> 00:24:55,076
[SPEAKER_05]: This coming from a Microsoft spokesperson.

386
00:24:55,616 --> 00:25:00,599
[SPEAKER_05]: There are currently no plans to release an Xbox 360 equipped with a next generation DVD player.

387
00:25:02,180 --> 00:25:02,381
[SPEAKER_04]: Yet.

388
00:25:02,401 --> 00:25:04,662
[SPEAKER_05]: Makes sense because... I added the yet myself, but yet.

389
00:25:04,882 --> 00:25:08,465
[SPEAKER_04]: Makes sense because HD DVD, we don't even know if that's the format they're going to be going to.

390
00:25:09,705 --> 00:25:11,787
[SPEAKER_05]: Completely random subject here, but I don't care.

391
00:25:11,867 --> 00:25:12,947
[SPEAKER_05]: It's one of those shows tonight.

392
00:25:12,967 --> 00:25:13,228
[SPEAKER_05]: Um...

393
00:25:14,698 --> 00:25:21,980
[SPEAKER_05]: I helped my friend go shopping for a Christmas present and my friend was buying a DVD recorder for a friend and there's all these recording formats.

394
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:27,542
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know much about it but there's like the R's, the RW, the R pluses or whatever.

395
00:25:27,982 --> 00:25:34,424
[SPEAKER_05]: All these things and they're like all these different formats and no standardization and these recorders are huge Christmas things.

396
00:25:34,444 --> 00:25:38,285
[SPEAKER_05]: This is kind of dangerous because it's like VHS and beta all over again.

397
00:25:38,325 --> 00:25:39,245
[SPEAKER_05]: We need to find a standard.

398
00:25:39,605 --> 00:25:42,926
[SPEAKER_04]: The actual standalone recorders, there's

399
00:25:43,373 --> 00:25:47,894
[SPEAKER_04]: They have the plus and the minus, and then the R, plus or minus R is what it is.

400
00:25:47,914 --> 00:25:51,295
[SPEAKER_05]: See, I couldn't make sense of all of it because they all sound too similar for me.

401
00:25:51,395 --> 00:25:52,835
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, they are very similar.

402
00:25:52,895 --> 00:25:56,476
[SPEAKER_04]: Plus and minus R are very similar, and then RW is just a rewritable one.

403
00:25:56,516 --> 00:25:59,777
[SPEAKER_05]: Not similar enough because one won't play on the other, depending on the machine.

404
00:25:59,817 --> 00:26:00,477
[SPEAKER_01]: Some will play both.

405
00:26:00,577 --> 00:26:07,539
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, mine will actually play both, like on the burner on my laptop, but I think it only records on plus R's.

406
00:26:07,924 --> 00:26:11,967
[SPEAKER_04]: I think PlusR has been the format that's actually what's being used now.

407
00:26:12,007 --> 00:26:18,092
[SPEAKER_04]: I know my DVD burner and my computer will do both, but it burns basically one format.

408
00:26:18,132 --> 00:26:18,892
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm behind the times.

409
00:26:18,932 --> 00:26:21,054
[SPEAKER_05]: I have no DVD burner recorder or any of that stuff.

410
00:26:21,774 --> 00:26:22,555
[SPEAKER_04]: You're not missing much.

411
00:26:23,316 --> 00:26:29,140
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, it's helped me out so much because I have a 250 gig hard drive on my PC that's almost full.

412
00:26:29,941 --> 00:26:31,422
[SPEAKER_05]: See, mine's not even near full yet.

413
00:26:31,542 --> 00:26:38,127
[SPEAKER_01]: But I can just go onto my network, burn off my stuff off of my laptop, save myself some space.

414
00:26:38,548 --> 00:26:38,868
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright.

415
00:26:39,288 --> 00:26:41,090
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, let's, okay, enough 360 talk.

416
00:26:41,890 --> 00:26:44,652
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, you have a story about another next-gen console.

417
00:26:44,693 --> 00:26:45,153
[SPEAKER_05]: What's going on?

418
00:26:45,785 --> 00:26:47,768
[SPEAKER_01]: Finally, some more stuff about the revolution.

419
00:26:48,649 --> 00:26:56,761
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, apparently the system has been, some dev kits have been released to some third parties, so there's been some feedback received.

420
00:26:58,063 --> 00:27:02,129
[SPEAKER_01]: So far, it's looking like, just the information that's been given back.

421
00:27:02,869 --> 00:27:08,312
[SPEAKER_01]: This is going to be powered by IBM CPU codenamed Broadway, very similar to the Gecko CPU in the GameCube.

422
00:27:09,653 --> 00:27:17,758
[SPEAKER_01]: It should run about twice the clock speed, actually up to three times the overall performance of the GameCube processor.

423
00:27:18,759 --> 00:27:23,942
[SPEAKER_01]: And they have an HCI graphics chip codenamed Hollywood, which I find so ridiculous.

424
00:27:23,962 --> 00:27:24,302
[SPEAKER_05]: Interesting.

425
00:27:24,482 --> 00:27:24,882
[SPEAKER_05]: Interesting.

426
00:27:28,260 --> 00:27:39,367
[SPEAKER_01]: Just to look at this yet though, they're saying that it's going to be about two and a half times more powerful than the GameCube, which is... The GameCube wasn't too bad at all.

427
00:27:40,588 --> 00:27:50,213
[SPEAKER_01]: There's also a note on here that it's going to pretty much use standard DVDs, but as a slot loader, it will actually be able to take in the old GameCube discs.

428
00:27:50,494 --> 00:27:51,034
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, okay, cool.

429
00:27:52,425 --> 00:28:04,399
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that that's actually pretty cool because the small discs, there hasn't been anything slot loading that would take those without some type of special tray to go with it.

430
00:28:04,419 --> 00:28:06,762
[SPEAKER_01]: The thing is that developers don't really know how to treat it.

431
00:28:07,423 --> 00:28:15,213
[SPEAKER_01]: They're talking about it being easy to program for though on a PC and you actually do more enhancements to it when you're porting it over.

432
00:28:16,475 --> 00:28:22,243
[SPEAKER_01]: But right now they've just been treating it like they're programming a GameCube game because the library is very similar.

433
00:28:24,285 --> 00:28:29,047
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, this whole news about the more powerful and stuff, it's all fine and good, but I'm not big on specs.

434
00:28:29,287 --> 00:28:35,849
[SPEAKER_05]: And I know a lot of our listeners are really big on specs, and they want to know exactly what the systems will do, but guys, remember the golden rule of gaming.

435
00:28:35,909 --> 00:28:36,869
[SPEAKER_05]: Everybody say it with me.

436
00:28:37,509 --> 00:28:41,430
[SPEAKER_05]: A system is only as good as the games that are on it.

437
00:28:41,490 --> 00:28:45,851
[SPEAKER_05]: So this thing could have rocket fuel, projection, lightning, laser, whatever.

438
00:28:46,992 --> 00:28:47,732
[SPEAKER_05]: If the games suck...

439
00:28:48,271 --> 00:28:48,771
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

440
00:29:03,872 --> 00:29:10,000
[SPEAKER_05]: That would be, I think, the smartest thing Nintendo could do if they were going to come in the market last, come in cheapest, make everybody else price slash.

441
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:18,049
[SPEAKER_01]: What surprises me, though, is the fact that they'd go with the standard format DVD, because Nintendo has been all about having their own storage system.

442
00:29:20,115 --> 00:29:25,138
[SPEAKER_01]: They made their money on the 64 with those humongous cartridges they had.

443
00:29:25,198 --> 00:29:31,601
[SPEAKER_05]: See, I think part of the reason they lost with the GameCube, or at least came in last place in America with the GameCube, is because it didn't support DVDs.

444
00:29:31,661 --> 00:29:33,903
[SPEAKER_05]: And honestly... That's what pushed Square away.

445
00:29:34,143 --> 00:29:35,083
[SPEAKER_05]: I've said this before.

446
00:29:35,484 --> 00:29:41,747
[SPEAKER_05]: I think the reason why PlayStation 2 dominated the way it did is because people were buying them as DVD players.

447
00:29:42,347 --> 00:29:45,529
[SPEAKER_05]: Even though, you know, the first gen, they say you weren't supposed to, whatever.

448
00:29:45,933 --> 00:29:46,353
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

449
00:30:09,502 --> 00:30:11,683
[SPEAKER_01]: The backwards compatibility was a big thing.

450
00:30:11,883 --> 00:30:13,743
[SPEAKER_01]: However, I did find it very hilarious.

451
00:30:13,803 --> 00:30:17,105
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that it's the Japanese one that had more issues with this than the U.S.

452
00:30:17,265 --> 00:30:17,365
[SPEAKER_01]: one.

453
00:30:18,065 --> 00:30:24,147
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that if you had on your texture smoothing, it would do very interesting things to some of the older games.

454
00:30:24,727 --> 00:30:30,309
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, I remember playing Bust a Move 2 with texture smoothing on, and Comet's head disappeared.

455
00:30:31,690 --> 00:30:32,450
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of her legs.

456
00:30:33,890 --> 00:30:36,491
[SPEAKER_05]: She can't really bust a move with only one leg now, can she?

457
00:30:36,531 --> 00:30:37,832
[SPEAKER_04]: Or without a head, yeah.

458
00:30:37,932 --> 00:30:38,572
[SPEAKER_01]: It was pretty funny.

459
00:30:40,110 --> 00:30:44,832
[SPEAKER_05]: Random, random, not related to anything comments, because we're talking about losing heads and stuff.

460
00:30:44,852 --> 00:30:47,934
[SPEAKER_05]: Somebody actually put a Photoshop in the MySpace, because you don't have people on MySpace.

461
00:30:47,954 --> 00:30:49,894
[SPEAKER_05]: They leave these comments that are just completely random.

462
00:30:50,455 --> 00:30:56,517
[SPEAKER_05]: One of my buddies actually put a comment on my MySpace that says, France, France, revolution, and it just shows the DDR cover with no head.

463
00:30:56,577 --> 00:30:57,458
[SPEAKER_05]: The head's on the ground.

464
00:30:57,538 --> 00:30:57,838
[SPEAKER_05]: Get it?

465
00:30:57,918 --> 00:30:59,658
[SPEAKER_05]: Because in France, they beheaded people.

466
00:31:00,019 --> 00:31:00,759
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, what is that?

467
00:31:02,702 --> 00:31:03,442
[SPEAKER_05]: Something in the air tonight.

468
00:31:03,462 --> 00:31:04,723
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it was those brownies you brought over.

469
00:31:04,743 --> 00:31:06,144
[SPEAKER_05]: Are you sure those were Starbucks brownies?

470
00:31:06,404 --> 00:31:08,085
[SPEAKER_01]: They were Starbucks brownies.

471
00:31:08,165 --> 00:31:10,946
[SPEAKER_01]: They have caffeine in them and Starbucks makes you stupid.

472
00:31:12,968 --> 00:31:15,889
[SPEAKER_01]: We are never getting sponsorship from Starbucks.

473
00:31:15,929 --> 00:31:16,389
[SPEAKER_05]: Good job.

474
00:31:16,570 --> 00:31:17,110
[SPEAKER_05]: Good job on that.

475
00:31:18,090 --> 00:31:20,872
[SPEAKER_05]: I think now is a good time in the show to talk about...

476
00:31:22,296 --> 00:31:22,837
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura.com

477
00:31:50,407 --> 00:31:52,451
[SPEAKER_01]: How to Survive a High-Rise Hotel Fire

478
00:32:01,055 --> 00:32:03,416
[SPEAKER_01]: Feel the hotel doorknob with the back of your hand.

479
00:32:03,937 --> 00:32:09,540
[SPEAKER_01]: If the knob is cool, open the door and escape via the nearest stairwell, keeping low with the hallway of smoke filled.

480
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:11,181
[SPEAKER_01]: Duh.

481
00:32:11,201 --> 00:32:11,181
2.

482
00:32:11,922 --> 00:32:15,284
[SPEAKER_01]: If the doorknob is hot, wedge wet towels under the door to keep smoke out.

483
00:32:15,704 --> 00:32:19,206
[SPEAKER_01]: Cover your head with wet towels and sheets to protect yourself from smoke inhalation.

484
00:32:19,606 --> 00:32:22,488
[SPEAKER_01]: You can also use the towel to signal rescue personnel at the window.

485
00:32:23,488 --> 00:32:22,488
3.

486
00:32:24,029 --> 00:32:27,531
[SPEAKER_01]: If the air is getting worse, try to kick through the closet wall into the adjacent room.

487
00:32:28,297 --> 00:32:34,181
[SPEAKER_01]: Knock on the wall until you hear a hollow sound which indicates the absence of wall studs and then use both feet to kick through the drywall.

488
00:32:34,862 --> 00:32:36,763
[SPEAKER_01]: But my final piece of advice on this one?

489
00:32:36,963 --> 00:32:37,184
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.

490
00:32:37,604 --> 00:32:44,489
[SPEAKER_01]: If you see a little sign outside the hotel that says now filming The Towering Inferno Part 2, stay somewhere else.

491
00:32:45,210 --> 00:32:46,010
[SPEAKER_01]: Good thoughts.

492
00:32:46,090 --> 00:32:49,913
[SPEAKER_04]: Or how about don't play with fire indoors?

493
00:32:50,293 --> 00:32:51,454
[SPEAKER_01]: Or unplug your Christmas tree.

494
00:32:51,955 --> 00:32:53,796
[SPEAKER_04]: Or stay in a hotel on the first floor.

495
00:32:55,477 --> 00:32:56,138
[SPEAKER_05]: Stay at Motel 6.

496
00:32:57,591 --> 00:32:58,131
[SPEAKER_01]: We had tiny rooms.

497
00:32:58,151 --> 00:32:58,432
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway.

498
00:33:22,952 --> 00:33:23,992
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki, give us a story.

499
00:33:24,032 --> 00:33:24,593
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't care what.

500
00:33:24,653 --> 00:33:25,593
[SPEAKER_05]: Take us away from this.

501
00:33:29,474 --> 00:33:45,539
[SPEAKER_04]: On the topic of Crack Horse, we have... It was actually brought to everyone's attention again, this old mod that was out for the original Zelda, a ROM that's been floating around on the internet called Zelda Challenge The Outlands, and it's been...

502
00:33:46,604 --> 00:33:47,004
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura

503
00:34:03,695 --> 00:34:03,975
[SPEAKER_05]: and so on.

504
00:34:25,902 --> 00:34:34,227
[SPEAKER_05]: The best worst mod I ever saw was an old Japanese game, it's called Nuts and Milk, and they never released it here for obvious reasons, because teehee nuts, right?

505
00:34:34,487 --> 00:34:39,370
[SPEAKER_05]: Well somebody actually went in and teehee nuts, they turned all the characters into, you know, nuts.

506
00:34:40,555 --> 00:34:45,078
[SPEAKER_05]: and the milk was, you know, that gross.

507
00:34:45,138 --> 00:34:57,446
[SPEAKER_01]: I downloaded Link's Awakening, the old Game Boy one, and I didn't find out until after I started playing it that it had been hacked, and his sword was like a dildo, and all the text had been changed.

508
00:34:57,506 --> 00:34:58,146
[SPEAKER_01]: That's so classy.

509
00:34:59,207 --> 00:35:03,790
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyways, this one has more dungeons, in fact, new weapons and whatnot.

510
00:35:04,430 --> 00:35:07,352
[SPEAKER_04]: Pretty cool, so you should go definitely check it out.

511
00:35:07,592 --> 00:35:08,953
[SPEAKER_04]: You can probably find it on the

512
00:35:09,505 --> 00:35:10,926
[SPEAKER_04]: Any ROM sites out there.

513
00:35:11,506 --> 00:35:13,347
[SPEAKER_04]: Zelda Challenge Outworld.

514
00:35:13,367 --> 00:35:15,348
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, check that out.

515
00:35:15,388 --> 00:35:17,149
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, you have some news about Quake 4.

516
00:35:17,669 --> 00:35:18,690
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep, I sure do.

517
00:35:19,250 --> 00:35:20,771
[SPEAKER_01]: Little tiny piece of news.

518
00:35:23,612 --> 00:35:28,735
[SPEAKER_01]: Aspire has taken pity on Mac users.

519
00:35:29,615 --> 00:35:33,497
[SPEAKER_01]: Quake 4 will be coming out for the Mac next year, sometime.

520
00:35:34,258 --> 00:35:36,899
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to be available for both PowerPC and Intel Macs.

521
00:35:37,674 --> 00:35:38,635
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

522
00:36:04,628 --> 00:36:07,170
[SPEAKER_01]: And actually, one of our listeners linked this to us.

523
00:36:07,310 --> 00:36:07,790
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, super.

524
00:36:08,230 --> 00:36:10,092
[SPEAKER_01]: Our fabulous Robway.

525
00:36:10,692 --> 00:36:11,352
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, of course.

526
00:36:11,613 --> 00:36:13,214
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

527
00:36:13,994 --> 00:36:20,518
[SPEAKER_01]: And it really goes into detail on these, but I'll just try to, I guess, summarize as best as I can.

528
00:36:21,979 --> 00:36:23,020
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you have a link to this?

529
00:36:23,060 --> 00:36:24,641
[SPEAKER_05]: Is this a quick link that you can read out?

530
00:36:24,661 --> 00:36:25,502
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I can read it out.

531
00:36:25,602 --> 00:36:32,807
[SPEAKER_01]: It's pbs.org slash kcts slash videogamerevolution slash impact slash myths.html.

532
00:36:33,737 --> 00:36:35,558
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, you might have to post that on the forums too, but that's interesting.

533
00:36:35,578 --> 00:36:37,718
[SPEAKER_05]: PBS, like public broadcasting system.

534
00:36:37,758 --> 00:36:38,078
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess.

535
00:36:38,219 --> 00:36:38,679
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, interesting.

536
00:36:38,719 --> 00:36:38,979
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

537
00:36:40,279 --> 00:36:48,242
[SPEAKER_01]: But the first one is that the availability of video games has led to an epidemic of youth violence, and basically it's, like we talked about before, that's totally not the case.

538
00:36:50,022 --> 00:36:58,745
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, the overwhelming majority, just to quote here, the overwhelming majority of kids who do not commit antisocial acts, they're talking about that...

539
00:37:02,035 --> 00:37:09,980
[SPEAKER_01]: All those reports that came back with some of our national facilities have proven that no, that's really not true.

540
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:14,582
[SPEAKER_05]: Video games can be a very social thing sometimes.

541
00:37:14,602 --> 00:37:17,004
[SPEAKER_05]: Seriously, get a full game of Mario Party going.

542
00:37:17,577 --> 00:37:19,518
[SPEAKER_05]: You'll see more social... Forget it.

543
00:37:19,918 --> 00:37:20,358
[SPEAKER_05]: Go ahead.

544
00:37:20,578 --> 00:37:26,761
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, number two, Scientific Evidence links video games play with youth aggression.

545
00:37:27,782 --> 00:37:33,884
[SPEAKER_01]: But the studies that they've done have been really inconclusive.

546
00:37:35,005 --> 00:37:36,946
[SPEAKER_01]: Their methodology has been criticized.

547
00:37:37,966 --> 00:37:40,047
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not thorough research.

548
00:37:41,395 --> 00:37:50,382
[SPEAKER_01]: There's also, they're not accounting for, it's mentioned on here, the risk factor coupled with more immediate real world influences.

549
00:37:51,162 --> 00:37:59,609
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, pretty much you learn violence is, I'd say it's actually a more instinctive human trait.

550
00:38:00,689 --> 00:38:09,516
[SPEAKER_01]: If somebody is going to be more prone to violent behavior, it's going to be a combination of home influence and biological predisposition.

551
00:38:10,316 --> 00:38:13,159
[SPEAKER_01]: 3.

552
00:38:10,336 --> 00:38:13,159
[SPEAKER_01]: Children are the primary market for video games.

553
00:38:23,502 --> 00:38:26,245
[SPEAKER_05]: Most of the games marketed though are for the older gamer.

554
00:38:26,265 --> 00:38:27,726
[SPEAKER_05]: For almost no girls play video games, high bullshit.

555
00:38:49,442 --> 00:38:56,330
[SPEAKER_01]: 5.

556
00:38:49,542 --> 00:38:56,330
[SPEAKER_01]: Because games are used to train soldiers to kill, they have the same impact on kids who play them.

557
00:39:00,215 --> 00:39:06,223
[SPEAKER_01]: Former military psychologist and moral reformer David Grossman argues that because the military uses games in training...

558
00:39:07,190 --> 00:39:10,153
[SPEAKER_01]: including, he claims, training soldiers to shoot and kill.

559
00:39:10,194 --> 00:39:16,981
[SPEAKER_01]: The generation of young people who play such games are primarily being brutalized and conditioned to be aggressive in their everyday social interactions.

560
00:39:17,482 --> 00:39:23,609
[SPEAKER_01]: Now this says his model only works if we remove training and education from a meaningful cultural context.

561
00:39:24,318 --> 00:39:28,559
[SPEAKER_01]: We assume leaders have no conscious goals and that they show no resistance to what they are being taught.

562
00:39:28,759 --> 00:39:29,399
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sorry, learners.

563
00:39:30,140 --> 00:39:35,221
[SPEAKER_01]: We assume they unwittingly apply what they've learned in a fantasy environment to real world aspects.

564
00:39:36,701 --> 00:39:36,841
[SPEAKER_01]: No.

565
00:39:38,101 --> 00:39:39,942
[SPEAKER_01]: And I agree with the rest of this.

566
00:39:39,982 --> 00:39:49,904
[SPEAKER_01]: It's basically pointing out that the games for training military are specifically geared toward training and they know that it is geared toward their training.

567
00:39:50,665 --> 00:39:51,945
[SPEAKER_01]: For a child playing a game,

568
00:39:52,481 --> 00:39:53,761
[SPEAKER_01]: In their head, it's a game.

569
00:39:53,922 --> 00:39:55,822
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't have to go out and kill somebody the next day.

570
00:39:56,102 --> 00:39:58,763
[SPEAKER_05]: Let me throw this out there, just kind of a discussion item.

571
00:39:59,364 --> 00:40:00,044
[SPEAKER_05]: America's Army.

572
00:40:02,285 --> 00:40:04,886
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that that's more of an enlistment tool.

573
00:40:06,026 --> 00:40:08,727
[SPEAKER_05]: I know a lot of people that play this just for the game, though.

574
00:40:08,747 --> 00:40:10,408
[SPEAKER_05]: It had nothing to do with the enlistment aspect of it.

575
00:40:10,448 --> 00:40:12,028
[SPEAKER_05]: It's actually a really popular game.

576
00:40:12,048 --> 00:40:14,049
[SPEAKER_05]: It kind of has a very cult-like following to it.

577
00:40:14,869 --> 00:40:15,789
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got my copies.

578
00:40:16,010 --> 00:40:18,570
[SPEAKER_05]: I just thought I'd throw that out there because it's kind of a fusion of what you're talking about.

579
00:40:18,630 --> 00:40:19,991
[SPEAKER_05]: Any other of those bullet points you want to bring up?

580
00:40:21,405 --> 00:40:25,587
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, actually, no, I wanted to move on to the next one here.

581
00:40:26,127 --> 00:40:28,669
[SPEAKER_01]: Video games are not a meaningful form of expression.

582
00:40:31,770 --> 00:40:32,810
[SPEAKER_05]: What about Mario Paint?

583
00:40:32,911 --> 00:40:34,751
[SPEAKER_05]: I expressed a lot in that game.

584
00:40:35,912 --> 00:40:39,594
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, the thing is, is that not all games are violent.

585
00:40:40,134 --> 00:40:43,736
[SPEAKER_01]: We have, like, you're talking about Final Fantasy IV having a beautiful story.

586
00:40:43,876 --> 00:40:44,236
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah.

587
00:40:44,696 --> 00:40:48,978
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, that's just a really narrow-minded... You know, as far as, like, say, for example...

588
00:40:49,659 --> 00:40:53,701
[SPEAKER_01]: When you play The Sims, that's actually very expressive.

589
00:40:53,721 --> 00:40:55,762
[SPEAKER_01]: You control the people's lives in there.

590
00:40:55,822 --> 00:40:57,983
[SPEAKER_01]: You can have them interact.

591
00:40:59,144 --> 00:41:00,704
[SPEAKER_01]: What about your online games?

592
00:41:01,845 --> 00:41:03,446
[SPEAKER_01]: There's plenty of room for expression.

593
00:41:04,506 --> 00:41:08,248
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, hell, MMOs are all about expression half the time.

594
00:41:09,489 --> 00:41:12,190
[SPEAKER_01]: Seven, video game play is socially isolating.

595
00:41:12,690 --> 00:41:13,591
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi, MMOs again.

596
00:41:15,742 --> 00:41:16,962
[SPEAKER_01]: We have friends over at our house.

597
00:41:16,982 --> 00:41:21,345
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, but that can go either way because some people can sit on an MMO all day long.

598
00:41:21,385 --> 00:41:30,089
[SPEAKER_05]: Of course, we've heard those horrible stories coming out of many different places about that folks die from forgetting to eat and drink from playing their MMOs all day.

599
00:41:30,189 --> 00:41:33,791
[SPEAKER_05]: So that can kind of go either way, but games don't.

600
00:41:34,981 --> 00:41:39,725
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, there's a comment on here that, in fact, I'll just read a little bit of it.

601
00:41:40,145 --> 00:41:40,926
[SPEAKER_01]: You're doing it all wrong!

602
00:41:40,986 --> 00:41:41,646
[SPEAKER_01]: Ha ha ha ha!

603
00:41:58,683 --> 00:41:59,023
[SPEAKER_01]: Smash Bros.

604
00:42:22,508 --> 00:42:29,252
[SPEAKER_01]: Video game play is desensitizing.

605
00:42:29,832 --> 00:42:37,037
[SPEAKER_01]: Classic study of play behavior among primates suggests that apes make basic distinction between play fighting and actual combat.

606
00:42:39,398 --> 00:42:39,999
[SPEAKER_01]: We're not monkeys.

607
00:42:43,311 --> 00:42:50,934
[SPEAKER_01]: But still, this is, I think that having the game here, and this actually mentions a little bit of this, that it's an outlet.

608
00:42:55,136 --> 00:43:02,200
[SPEAKER_01]: It can be used to let out this aggression that's within people so that you're better able to cope with the real world.

609
00:43:02,620 --> 00:43:08,362
[SPEAKER_01]: They're wanting to prove that playing a violent game makes you more violent outside.

610
00:43:08,622 --> 00:43:09,663
[SPEAKER_01]: Was this a TV show?

611
00:43:10,399 --> 00:43:11,759
[SPEAKER_05]: Because it's on PBS.org.

612
00:43:11,799 --> 00:43:12,940
[SPEAKER_05]: Was this a TV special?

613
00:43:13,240 --> 00:43:13,480
[SPEAKER_01]: I know.

614
00:43:13,620 --> 00:43:14,020
[SPEAKER_05]: It should be.

615
00:43:14,060 --> 00:43:14,520
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think so.

616
00:43:14,640 --> 00:43:14,920
[SPEAKER_01]: It should be.

617
00:43:14,940 --> 00:43:15,620
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think it should be.

618
00:43:15,980 --> 00:43:18,381
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that it should be broadcast on every freaking channel.

619
00:43:18,401 --> 00:43:20,541
[SPEAKER_05]: There should be an episode of Penn & Teller's bullshit right here.

620
00:43:21,942 --> 00:43:22,422
[SPEAKER_01]: About video games.

621
00:43:22,442 --> 00:43:23,582
[SPEAKER_01]: It should be on 60 Minutes.

622
00:43:24,562 --> 00:43:25,162
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a good point.

623
00:43:25,262 --> 00:43:25,502
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway.

624
00:43:25,882 --> 00:43:35,805
[SPEAKER_01]: But at any rate, you know, their whole argument with this one is that you would basically lose empathy for real world situations by experiencing them in a virtual environment.

625
00:43:36,585 --> 00:43:37,085
[SPEAKER_01]: Not the case.

626
00:43:38,152 --> 00:43:45,838
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, by giving yourself an outlet in one forum, I think that it would make a person better able to cope in a real forum.

627
00:43:48,600 --> 00:43:52,663
[SPEAKER_05]: Interesting discussions that that article kind of invokes there.

628
00:43:52,703 --> 00:43:53,944
[SPEAKER_05]: So thank you for sharing with us.

629
00:43:53,964 --> 00:43:54,664
[SPEAKER_01]: That was a very good one.

630
00:43:54,704 --> 00:43:56,326
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, we need to thank our buddy Rob.

631
00:43:56,566 --> 00:43:56,806
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

632
00:43:56,846 --> 00:43:57,887
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, buddy Rob.

633
00:43:59,448 --> 00:44:02,150
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki, let's go from all that.

634
00:44:02,310 --> 00:44:03,511
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's talk about a good old war game.

635
00:44:03,731 --> 00:44:04,672
[SPEAKER_04]: Tell us about Gears of War.

636
00:44:05,762 --> 00:44:06,262
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's the worst.

637
00:44:06,362 --> 00:44:06,883
[SPEAKER_04]: Sexy.

638
00:44:07,203 --> 00:44:08,204
[SPEAKER_04]: That's all you need to know.

639
00:44:08,684 --> 00:44:16,929
[SPEAKER_04]: No, actually, they released some footage from, I believe it was Zero Hour, where they were showing off the game, and it's sexy.

640
00:44:17,910 --> 00:44:21,352
[SPEAKER_04]: This right here is the killer app for the 360.

641
00:44:22,873 --> 00:44:23,414
[SPEAKER_04]: Definitely.

642
00:44:25,115 --> 00:44:28,557
[SPEAKER_04]: What they did show is just the amazing graphics in it, as well as...

643
00:44:30,792 --> 00:44:33,453
[SPEAKER_04]: Kind of different things that they're doing with the storyline stuff.

644
00:44:33,513 --> 00:44:34,053
[SPEAKER_04]: It's really cool.

645
00:44:36,114 --> 00:44:40,396
[SPEAKER_04]: But that's one you're definitely going to be wanting to check out when it comes out.

646
00:44:40,416 --> 00:44:42,537
[SPEAKER_04]: I believe in April or March.

647
00:44:43,677 --> 00:44:44,357
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, sounds good.

648
00:44:45,458 --> 00:44:48,939
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's go ahead and open up the old mailbag and see what our listeners have to say.

649
00:44:49,019 --> 00:44:58,183
[SPEAKER_05]: Remember guys, if you want to send us an email, all you've got to do is write us togoto at orangeloungeradio.com and DarkSakura will...

650
00:44:59,386 --> 00:45:00,767
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

651
00:45:23,980 --> 00:45:25,241
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't we have something on forums for that now?

652
00:45:25,261 --> 00:45:28,082
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why I made that thread.

653
00:45:28,142 --> 00:45:29,002
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, good segue, good segue.

654
00:45:29,042 --> 00:45:36,125
[SPEAKER_01]: If you go onto our forums at orangeloungeradio.com, there is a link under console gaming.

655
00:45:37,325 --> 00:45:39,326
[SPEAKER_01]: I posted my friend code for Animal Crossing.

656
00:45:40,727 --> 00:45:43,608
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't checked it lately, but we need to get more people on there.

657
00:45:43,976 --> 00:45:46,076
[SPEAKER_05]: When I go back to Animal Crossing, I'll post my friend code.

658
00:45:46,236 --> 00:45:47,697
[SPEAKER_05]: But for right now, I'm not fancy for it.

659
00:45:47,717 --> 00:45:49,317
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can come visit me in Danville.

660
00:45:49,797 --> 00:45:50,777
[SPEAKER_01]: Not Danville, Hades.

661
00:45:50,857 --> 00:45:51,637
[SPEAKER_01]: Dan with Danville.

662
00:45:51,798 --> 00:45:53,078
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll post my husband's too.

663
00:45:53,398 --> 00:45:54,918
[SPEAKER_05]: And Loki has OLR Town, right?

664
00:45:55,118 --> 00:45:56,858
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

665
00:45:57,079 --> 00:45:59,319
[SPEAKER_05]: You guys are doing Animal Crossing spam or something?

666
00:46:00,099 --> 00:46:01,999
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, we're doing Animal Crossing spam.

667
00:46:02,100 --> 00:46:02,720
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, that's great.

668
00:46:02,880 --> 00:46:06,140
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, I'm going to open up a contest.

669
00:46:06,880 --> 00:46:07,841
[SPEAKER_01]: A little tiny contest.

670
00:46:08,481 --> 00:46:09,581
[SPEAKER_01]: If you get a bottle...

671
00:46:11,070 --> 00:46:21,120
[SPEAKER_01]: If from the ocean a message in a bottle that has Orange Lounge Radio written by me or Loki or Rob, then we'll send you a box of cookies.

672
00:46:22,001 --> 00:46:23,623
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, you're buying those cookies and shipping them then?

673
00:46:23,643 --> 00:46:24,564
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll buy the cookies and ship them.

674
00:46:24,584 --> 00:46:24,964
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, good.

675
00:46:26,045 --> 00:46:27,927
[SPEAKER_01]: They may be moldy by the time you get them, but I'll do it.

676
00:46:29,949 --> 00:46:30,750
[SPEAKER_05]: Anything else in the mail box?

677
00:46:30,870 --> 00:46:34,414
[SPEAKER_01]: If you live in another country, I'll send you cookies that you can only get here.

678
00:46:35,523 --> 00:46:36,263
[SPEAKER_05]: Girl Scout Cookies.

679
00:46:36,343 --> 00:46:36,643
[SPEAKER_05]: Delicious.

680
00:46:36,663 --> 00:46:37,404
[SPEAKER_01]: Girl Scout Cookies.

681
00:46:37,484 --> 00:46:37,744
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright.

682
00:46:38,224 --> 00:46:39,024
[SPEAKER_05]: Moving on.

683
00:46:39,204 --> 00:46:43,846
[SPEAKER_01]: What else?

684
00:46:43,866 --> 00:46:50,208
[SPEAKER_01]: We got a couple more listeners write in about the whole parental debate.

685
00:46:50,788 --> 00:46:53,089
[SPEAKER_01]: We actually got one person who didn't like our last episode.

686
00:46:53,849 --> 00:46:54,029
[SPEAKER_05]: Aww.

687
00:46:54,169 --> 00:46:55,790
[SPEAKER_01]: Because we talked about Animal Crossing too much.

688
00:46:56,070 --> 00:46:58,071
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, it's the game of the week.

689
00:46:58,091 --> 00:46:58,831
[SPEAKER_05]: What are you supposed to do?

690
00:46:59,451 --> 00:47:01,532
[SPEAKER_01]: Lots of people are playing Animal Crossing.

691
00:47:01,752 --> 00:47:02,312
[SPEAKER_05]: That's alright.

692
00:47:02,332 --> 00:47:02,952
[SPEAKER_05]: You're welcome to your pit.

693
00:47:02,972 --> 00:47:04,113
[SPEAKER_05]: We talk about other games too.

694
00:47:04,133 --> 00:47:04,513
[SPEAKER_01]: We try to

695
00:47:05,959 --> 00:47:09,181
[SPEAKER_05]: It just so happens that all three of us enjoy Animal Crossing, so it's going to come up.

696
00:47:09,241 --> 00:47:09,862
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, whatever.

697
00:47:09,882 --> 00:47:10,622
[SPEAKER_05]: That's fine.

698
00:47:10,642 --> 00:47:15,405
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, we got a few thank yous from some of the parents for reading the articles.

699
00:47:15,465 --> 00:47:23,471
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, the one that I was very impressed with, Sloan that wrote us, that was a very, very good letter.

700
00:47:23,511 --> 00:47:32,877
[SPEAKER_01]: And he wrote back just to say that, you know, he actually, you know, felt he was good to hear, you know, us read the letter.

701
00:47:33,538 --> 00:47:33,818
[SPEAKER_01]: Also...

702
00:47:34,807 --> 00:47:35,548
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for watching!

703
00:47:54,031 --> 00:47:57,534
[SPEAKER_01]: But he gave us the okay to post that letter on the site.

704
00:47:57,674 --> 00:47:57,894
[SPEAKER_05]: Great.

705
00:47:58,174 --> 00:48:00,456
[SPEAKER_01]: So I will be doing that shortly within the week.

706
00:48:00,816 --> 00:48:01,036
[SPEAKER_00]: Great.

707
00:48:01,517 --> 00:48:03,198
[SPEAKER_01]: I've just been busy with finals.

708
00:48:03,218 --> 00:48:03,778
[SPEAKER_00]: That's fine.

709
00:48:04,679 --> 00:48:05,520
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

710
00:48:07,161 --> 00:48:13,786
[SPEAKER_01]: And someone actually sent us an email as a Mac man.

711
00:48:15,367 --> 00:48:21,612
[SPEAKER_01]: So in response to playing copyrighted music on a podcast, as Gunn says, there isn't a crime if there isn't a law.

712
00:48:23,851 --> 00:48:24,271
[SPEAKER_05]: Hint, hint.

713
00:48:44,216 --> 00:48:53,319
[SPEAKER_01]: The last one is an article sent to us by our friend Sasuke.

714
00:48:54,459 --> 00:49:02,322
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, I actually mentioned him in that other article I read via ex-Army Ranger and West Point psychology professor Grossman.

715
00:49:03,849 --> 00:49:05,210
[SPEAKER_01]: Lieutenant Colonel Dave Grossman.

716
00:49:05,570 --> 00:49:17,096
[SPEAKER_01]: Apparently he's been all in demand by law enforcement agencies talking about video game violence when, you know, there's proof that we don't have the situation.

717
00:49:17,676 --> 00:49:19,377
[SPEAKER_05]: Was this this other article you were going to talk about here?

718
00:49:19,457 --> 00:49:20,938
[SPEAKER_05]: You want to... Oh, okay, cool.

719
00:49:21,098 --> 00:49:22,739
[SPEAKER_01]: I was moving into it.

720
00:49:22,759 --> 00:49:23,319
[SPEAKER_05]: Just making sure.

721
00:49:23,639 --> 00:49:28,261
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I was trying to be all smooth and ninja-like with my recording skills.

722
00:49:28,281 --> 00:49:28,562
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sorry.

723
00:49:28,582 --> 00:49:30,022
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm scatterbrained tonight.

724
00:49:31,243 --> 00:49:33,304
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't get my mind off Actraiser and how beautiful it is.

725
00:49:34,181 --> 00:49:35,101
[SPEAKER_01]: We need a new Actriser.

726
00:49:35,541 --> 00:49:36,642
[SPEAKER_05]: I just, I said that.

727
00:49:36,862 --> 00:49:37,362
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, see?

728
00:49:38,242 --> 00:49:38,882
[SPEAKER_05]: Bad transition.

729
00:49:38,942 --> 00:49:39,182
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway.

730
00:49:39,762 --> 00:49:42,723
[SPEAKER_01]: And anyway, he says that first person shooters are murder simulators.

731
00:49:46,164 --> 00:49:46,604
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what?

732
00:49:46,644 --> 00:49:47,904
[SPEAKER_05]: Didn't Jack Thompson say that?

733
00:49:48,185 --> 00:49:48,805
[SPEAKER_01]: I know.

734
00:49:49,125 --> 00:49:49,465
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

735
00:49:49,525 --> 00:49:51,145
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't want to misquote somebody.

736
00:49:51,565 --> 00:49:52,946
[SPEAKER_01]: They're all screwing each other.

737
00:49:53,566 --> 00:49:53,886
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway.

738
00:49:56,903 --> 00:50:03,446
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, it's just, and really, it's more of the same bullshit we've had spewed out of many, many people's mouths.

739
00:50:04,186 --> 00:50:06,767
[SPEAKER_01]: And my thought on all of this is, please shut up.

740
00:50:07,988 --> 00:50:10,209
[SPEAKER_01]: Y'all don't know what you're talking about.

741
00:50:10,349 --> 00:50:13,350
[SPEAKER_01]: It makes you sound like a big, stupid butthead.

742
00:50:13,450 --> 00:50:20,953
[SPEAKER_05]: All this hot coffee, seriously, if hot coffee really bothered you in 2005, it's time to switch to decaf in 2006.

743
00:50:20,993 --> 00:50:21,333
[SPEAKER_05]: Iced latte.

744
00:50:23,789 --> 00:50:24,329
[SPEAKER_05]: No decaf.

745
00:50:24,909 --> 00:50:25,530
[SPEAKER_05]: Or tea.

746
00:50:25,990 --> 00:50:26,930
[SPEAKER_01]: Go to tea.

747
00:50:27,070 --> 00:50:28,211
[SPEAKER_05]: Do some chai tea.

748
00:50:28,671 --> 00:50:28,991
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki.

749
00:50:29,291 --> 00:50:29,631
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, I'm sorry.

750
00:50:29,651 --> 00:50:30,411
[SPEAKER_05]: Anything else in the mailbag?

751
00:50:31,252 --> 00:50:31,872
[SPEAKER_01]: No.

752
00:50:32,972 --> 00:50:33,693
[SPEAKER_01]: Lots of links from up.

753
00:50:33,853 --> 00:50:38,575
[SPEAKER_05]: To go at OrangeLoungeRadio.com and email us and love us.

754
00:50:38,955 --> 00:50:39,275
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki.

755
00:50:39,295 --> 00:50:40,595
[SPEAKER_04]: A couple things.

756
00:50:41,256 --> 00:50:46,217
[SPEAKER_04]: First, being that we're getting into a new year, what is one of the things you must do?

757
00:50:46,598 --> 00:50:47,618
[SPEAKER_04]: Get a new calendar.

758
00:50:49,161 --> 00:50:51,721
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, PSPMagazines.com has you covered.

759
00:50:51,741 --> 00:50:53,122
[SPEAKER_05]: But I don't want a new calendar.

760
00:50:53,282 --> 00:50:55,522
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, you can have a sexy new calendar.

761
00:50:55,642 --> 00:50:56,262
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, never mind.

762
00:50:56,302 --> 00:51:01,723
[SPEAKER_04]: From ForHim Magazine or other sites.

763
00:51:01,843 --> 00:51:08,304
[SPEAKER_04]: They also have a calendar from ForHim Magazine, the 2006 PSP calendar featuring sexy babes.

764
00:51:08,364 --> 00:51:09,664
[SPEAKER_05]: A PSP calendar.

765
00:51:10,265 --> 00:51:12,925
[SPEAKER_04]: And the Maxim 2006 calendar.

766
00:51:13,305 --> 00:51:15,806
[SPEAKER_04]: These are actually four-year backdrops.

767
00:51:16,306 --> 00:51:18,486
[SPEAKER_04]: You can add them into your themes and stuff.

768
00:51:20,049 --> 00:51:20,830
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura

769
00:51:46,386 --> 00:52:00,169
[SPEAKER_04]: On Monday the 19th, Nintendo of America's Executive Vice President of Sales and Marketing, Reggie Fils Ami, at 4 o'clock to 5.30 Pacific Time, you can actually get a chance to play him at Mario Kart DS.

770
00:52:09,803 --> 00:52:12,847
[SPEAKER_04]: If you get lucky and at 4 p.m.

771
00:52:12,927 --> 00:52:22,636
[SPEAKER_04]: Pacific Time start hammering the worldwide mode on your Wi-Fi and you might get lucky to go against NOA Reggie.

772
00:52:24,418 --> 00:52:25,599
[SPEAKER_04]: So, yeah.

773
00:52:26,140 --> 00:52:28,702
[SPEAKER_05]: How many fake NOA Reggies are going to be logged in though, I wonder?

774
00:52:29,973 --> 00:52:31,113
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe they don't let you, I don't know.

775
00:52:31,193 --> 00:52:31,853
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think they let you.

776
00:52:31,893 --> 00:52:39,815
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyways, although if you happen to live near Bellevue, Washington, he will be at the Bellevue Square McDonald's at that time.

777
00:52:39,855 --> 00:52:42,675
[SPEAKER_04]: You can actually meet him there and get some Nintendo swag as well.

778
00:52:43,935 --> 00:52:47,856
[SPEAKER_05]: Which just goes to show, executives dine on McDonald's once in a while too.

779
00:52:47,916 --> 00:52:53,777
[SPEAKER_05]: They have to get down and dirty with the rest of us and get their 99 cent menus and stuff.

780
00:52:54,017 --> 00:52:58,998
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly, so I think that's pretty cool that they're doing that kind of stuff, so

781
00:53:00,461 --> 00:53:01,201
[SPEAKER_04]: Good luck, people.

782
00:53:01,601 --> 00:53:04,623
[SPEAKER_04]: I know a lot of the Snakers out there would like to go up against him.

783
00:53:05,703 --> 00:53:07,143
[SPEAKER_05]: Expose all the bugs in the game, please.

784
00:53:07,163 --> 00:53:11,585
[SPEAKER_04]: Apparently, this guy is really good at Mario Kart, so it should be interesting.

785
00:53:11,785 --> 00:53:12,145
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll see.

786
00:53:13,186 --> 00:53:14,226
[SPEAKER_05]: I know you had one other quick thing.

787
00:53:14,246 --> 00:53:15,487
[SPEAKER_05]: I want you to make sure you get all the stories out.

788
00:53:15,667 --> 00:53:18,628
[SPEAKER_05]: The thing about the Game Boy, the old-ass Game Boy?

789
00:53:18,668 --> 00:53:21,829
[SPEAKER_04]: That's all speculation and rumors, so I'm not going to really go into it.

790
00:53:22,309 --> 00:53:27,431
[SPEAKER_04]: Basically, the whole story was about the system that they're saying is going to be called Game Boy Evolution.

791
00:53:27,970 --> 00:53:33,234
[SPEAKER_04]: and how it's supposed to come out later and it's supposed to rival the PSP, yada yada yada.

792
00:53:33,274 --> 00:53:40,040
[SPEAKER_04]: This is stuff that's been in development since 2004 and since there's no actual firm information on it, it's all speculation.

793
00:53:40,100 --> 00:53:41,061
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not even going to cover it.

794
00:53:42,461 --> 00:53:42,942
[SPEAKER_05]: Interesting.

795
00:53:44,223 --> 00:53:55,914
[SPEAKER_05]: I have a story here that talks about the biggest blockbusters of 2005 and it kind of coordinates with another story that you've probably seen around the internet talking about video game sales have fallen 18% this year.

796
00:53:55,954 --> 00:53:59,398
[SPEAKER_05]: And of course they're blaming that on no big blockbuster titles this year.

797
00:53:59,418 --> 00:54:00,819
[SPEAKER_05]: We did not have a Halo 2 this year.

798
00:54:00,839 --> 00:54:03,241
[SPEAKER_05]: We did not have a Grand Theft Auto San Andreas this year.

799
00:54:03,522 --> 00:54:04,823
[SPEAKER_05]: So they're saying that because of this,

800
00:54:05,444 --> 00:54:13,451
[SPEAKER_05]: Even with the Xbox 360, well, heck, not everybody who wanted to buy an Xbox 360 could get one, so video game sales on the whole have fallen a little bit.

801
00:54:13,732 --> 00:54:18,837
[SPEAKER_05]: This kind of doesn't surprise me, though, honestly, because we're sitting on the cusp of the next gaming generation.

802
00:54:19,297 --> 00:54:21,580
[SPEAKER_05]: This should be natural for the game sales to fall, right?

803
00:54:21,660 --> 00:54:26,825
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know why this is such a shock, but what's interesting, I thought what's interesting, the top...

804
00:54:28,002 --> 00:54:31,224
[SPEAKER_05]: The top ten selling games of 2005 through November.

805
00:54:31,705 --> 00:54:34,446
[SPEAKER_05]: Only three of them actually released in 2005.

806
00:54:35,547 --> 00:54:43,192
[SPEAKER_05]: Madden, Madden Football, Gran Turismo 4, Pokemon Emerald were the only games released in 2005 to make the top ten list.

807
00:54:43,733 --> 00:54:50,897
[SPEAKER_05]: And hell, even Halo, released in 2001 on the original Xbox thanks to price cuts and things, number nine on the list.

808
00:54:52,158 --> 00:54:52,698
[SPEAKER_05]: Crazy, huh?

809
00:54:52,899 --> 00:54:54,880
[SPEAKER_05]: They're saying also part of the reason this is, you know...

810
00:54:56,065 --> 00:54:57,586
[SPEAKER_05]: The sales figures are not what they should be.

811
00:54:58,147 --> 00:55:01,490
[SPEAKER_05]: Most of the hugely anticipated games for 2005 bumped to 2006.

812
00:55:02,831 --> 00:55:07,616
[SPEAKER_05]: Kingdom Hearts 2, Final Fantasy XII, Zelda, Twilight Princess.

813
00:55:08,377 --> 00:55:10,199
[SPEAKER_05]: Everything got bumped, so what's left?

814
00:55:10,639 --> 00:55:16,225
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly, and the other thing that's interesting to note is on the Xbox 360, they're live.

815
00:55:16,245 --> 00:55:18,187
[SPEAKER_04]: The number one game on there, Halo 2.

816
00:55:20,327 --> 00:55:20,747
[SPEAKER_05]: Interesting.

817
00:55:22,168 --> 00:55:29,473
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, now we're going to end tonight's show, but we're going to talk about some sexy things to end tonight's show, some sexy things for your Christmas season.

818
00:55:29,714 --> 00:55:31,775
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, you got a sexy MMO?

819
00:55:32,896 --> 00:55:35,818
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a porn company called Naughty America.

820
00:55:36,308 --> 00:55:37,329
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen

821
00:56:04,230 --> 00:56:10,460
[SPEAKER_01]: You can also though change your appearance by going to clothing stores, hair salons, tattoo parlor, plastic surgeon.

822
00:56:11,301 --> 00:56:15,267
[SPEAKER_05]: Didn't Yahoo Messenger just roll out the avatar thing where you can do the hair salon and everything?

823
00:56:15,888 --> 00:56:17,531
[SPEAKER_05]: There's some interesting correlations here.

824
00:56:18,703 --> 00:56:20,524
[SPEAKER_01]: But you've got different areas.

825
00:56:20,584 --> 00:56:24,507
[SPEAKER_01]: You have like downtown with your sex shops and video games.

826
00:56:24,527 --> 00:56:26,268
[SPEAKER_04]: Does Yahoo Messenger have the sex shops?

827
00:56:26,448 --> 00:56:27,308
[SPEAKER_04]: No, it doesn't.

828
00:56:27,408 --> 00:56:33,772
[SPEAKER_01]: Uptown, you've got outdoor cafes, casino, beach has boardwalks, swimming, poolside bars, goose trips.

829
00:56:34,012 --> 00:56:36,134
[SPEAKER_05]: Wasn't this just what Sims Online turned into?

830
00:56:36,154 --> 00:56:37,434
[SPEAKER_05]: I have no idea.

831
00:56:37,474 --> 00:56:41,337
[SPEAKER_05]: I heard some story a while back that Sims Online, because remember the Sims Online was supposed to be this huge thing.

832
00:56:41,597 --> 00:56:45,639
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, just like the real world, the Sims Online got corrupted by porn and casino and all that stuff.

833
00:56:45,699 --> 00:56:46,520
[SPEAKER_05]: And now it's just like,

834
00:56:47,819 --> 00:56:49,981
[SPEAKER_01]: But this one actually has sex mode.

835
00:56:51,262 --> 00:56:51,462
[SPEAKER_01]: Really?

836
00:56:51,482 --> 00:56:57,588
[SPEAKER_01]: Where you can invite another player on a date and engage in interpersonal activity.

837
00:56:57,608 --> 00:56:58,589
[SPEAKER_01]: Some hot coffee.

838
00:56:59,870 --> 00:57:01,291
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you invite them over for some hot coffee?

839
00:57:01,411 --> 00:57:06,496
[SPEAKER_01]: Wasn't there a game that we saw over by the folks that did Xtango?

840
00:57:06,576 --> 00:57:09,158
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, um... Feel 3.

841
00:57:09,318 --> 00:57:11,320
[SPEAKER_05]: Feel 3, thank you, that's a game.

842
00:57:11,360 --> 00:57:13,562
[SPEAKER_01]: Where you actually broke the demo and had them...

843
00:57:14,306 --> 00:57:17,547
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, you actually got... Loki did so good on the demo.

844
00:57:17,587 --> 00:57:22,888
[SPEAKER_05]: Somebody actually had to come by and put their hand up on the monitor because this person was starting to show too much.

845
00:57:23,868 --> 00:57:24,948
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I got a picture of that.

846
00:57:24,968 --> 00:57:26,549
[SPEAKER_01]: It should be up on our E3 picks.

847
00:57:26,629 --> 00:57:27,809
[SPEAKER_05]: I know, it's somewhere in the gallery.

848
00:57:27,969 --> 00:57:29,149
[SPEAKER_01]: No, no, no, no, no!

849
00:57:29,169 --> 00:57:30,750
No, no, no, no, no!

850
00:57:31,190 --> 00:57:32,250
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it was the last day.

851
00:57:33,490 --> 00:57:34,131
[SPEAKER_05]: I remember that.

852
00:57:34,211 --> 00:57:37,471
[SPEAKER_04]: I should have taken that as my cue to start clicking like hell.

853
00:57:39,412 --> 00:57:40,272
[SPEAKER_01]: That was hilarious.

854
00:57:42,547 --> 00:57:45,149
[SPEAKER_05]: Didn't one of us ask them if there would be dude-on-dude action?

855
00:57:45,809 --> 00:57:45,969
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

856
00:57:46,349 --> 00:57:47,850
[SPEAKER_05]: I think you or me asked about that.

857
00:57:47,970 --> 00:57:49,191
[SPEAKER_01]: One man played woman.

858
00:57:50,151 --> 00:57:52,712
[SPEAKER_05]: We asked about that, like, could the game go there?

859
00:57:52,953 --> 00:57:53,833
[SPEAKER_05]: And they told us no.

860
00:57:54,853 --> 00:57:57,195
[SPEAKER_05]: They didn't understand, I don't think, what we were asking.

861
00:57:57,835 --> 00:57:59,416
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you be gay in this game?

862
00:58:00,236 --> 00:58:01,057
[SPEAKER_05]: Can you be cowboys?

863
00:58:01,177 --> 00:58:02,797
[SPEAKER_05]: Can you both dress up as cowboys?

864
00:58:02,877 --> 00:58:04,138
[SPEAKER_01]: He said, boy play woman.

865
00:58:04,898 --> 00:58:05,239
[SPEAKER_05]: Single.

866
00:58:05,279 --> 00:58:06,719
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what he said.

867
00:58:06,819 --> 00:58:08,000
[SPEAKER_05]: I remember that now, that's right now.

868
00:58:10,197 --> 00:58:12,559
[SPEAKER_01]: I delegate my assignment to Loki.

869
00:58:12,579 --> 00:58:19,383
[SPEAKER_01]: The only thing that this does not have that Feel 3 does is USB accessories to go with it

870
00:58:40,259 --> 00:58:43,481
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, Feel 3 had attachments.

871
00:58:44,001 --> 00:58:45,002
[SPEAKER_05]: Like the Rez vibrator?

872
00:58:45,022 --> 00:58:46,222
[SPEAKER_05]: The trance vibrator?

873
00:58:46,302 --> 00:58:48,464
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, but this thing wasn't a trance.

874
00:58:48,704 --> 00:58:50,645
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm still looking for one of those, by the way.

875
00:58:51,085 --> 00:58:52,206
[SPEAKER_01]: I finally found a copy of Rez.

876
00:58:52,226 --> 00:58:52,946
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, TMI, honey.

877
00:58:53,547 --> 00:58:54,607
[SPEAKER_01]: No, no, no, no, no, no.

878
00:58:55,848 --> 00:58:58,449
[SPEAKER_01]: Just to see if it's really as awful as they say it is.

879
00:58:58,489 --> 00:59:00,610
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm not going to use it for that, you perv.

880
00:59:02,792 --> 00:59:03,752
[SPEAKER_05]: I have a sexy story.

881
00:59:04,513 --> 00:59:06,174
[SPEAKER_05]: Actually, I don't know if this is sexy or not.

882
00:59:07,594 --> 00:59:08,395
[SPEAKER_05]: Craigslist...

883
00:59:08,973 --> 00:59:10,433
[SPEAKER_05]: which should say it all right there.

884
00:59:10,473 --> 00:59:14,595
[SPEAKER_05]: If you want to see some real nasty stuff, Craigslist is the place for you to be.

885
00:59:14,635 --> 00:59:15,975
[SPEAKER_05]: Just check out some of the personals on there.

886
00:59:16,015 --> 00:59:17,235
[SPEAKER_05]: Not that I know firsthand or anything.

887
00:59:17,575 --> 00:59:22,217
[SPEAKER_05]: However, there were some posts on Craigslist in the Boston area.

888
00:59:22,777 --> 00:59:26,118
[SPEAKER_05]: There was a young woman there that was willing to trade sex.

889
00:59:26,880 --> 00:59:28,481
[SPEAKER_05]: for an Xbox 360.

890
00:59:28,561 --> 00:59:33,645
[SPEAKER_05]: She also was describing a female, talking about a little menage a trois action.

891
00:59:33,665 --> 00:59:36,747
[SPEAKER_05]: If you don't know what I mean by that, ask your parents.

892
00:59:37,527 --> 00:59:37,887
[SPEAKER_05]: No, don't.

893
00:59:39,969 --> 00:59:42,330
[SPEAKER_05]: It has to be a premium bundle.

894
00:59:42,410 --> 00:59:47,954
[SPEAKER_05]: These guys only want premium bundles for their sexual encounter.

895
00:59:49,545 --> 00:59:52,427
[SPEAKER_05]: However, the post was removed, just so you guys know.

896
00:59:52,447 --> 00:59:57,049
[SPEAKER_05]: The post was removed from Craigslist, but not before millions of nerds on the internet had a good laugh at it.

897
00:59:58,150 --> 00:59:59,871
[SPEAKER_04]: The post was removed because she was a sea donkey.

898
01:00:04,874 --> 01:00:12,338
[SPEAKER_05]: And apparently some gaming journalists actually tried to write the person an email to see if this person was serious, and maybe that's why it got removed.

899
01:00:12,458 --> 01:00:13,139
[SPEAKER_05]: I have no idea.

900
01:00:13,799 --> 01:00:14,359
[SPEAKER_05]: But anyway...

901
01:00:16,866 --> 01:00:20,927
[SPEAKER_05]: Some people are willing to go to great lengths to get that Xbox 360 before Christmas.

902
01:00:21,007 --> 01:00:23,508
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, you're pointing at something and going, oh my god, oh my god.

903
01:00:24,569 --> 01:00:28,830
[SPEAKER_01]: As I typically do, check VGCats, which is one of my favorite webcomics.

904
01:00:29,550 --> 01:00:32,011
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all Animal Crossing and everybody needs to look at today's.

905
01:00:32,871 --> 01:00:35,312
[SPEAKER_05]: You talk about Animal Crossing too much on this show, DarkSakura.

906
01:00:36,012 --> 01:00:36,473
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh no!

907
01:00:36,793 --> 01:00:37,913
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm taking that game away from you.

908
01:00:38,013 --> 01:00:38,333
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright.

909
01:00:38,553 --> 01:00:39,094
[SPEAKER_05]: No!

910
01:00:39,474 --> 01:00:40,314
[SPEAKER_05]: We gotta wrap up.

911
01:00:40,354 --> 01:00:40,934
[SPEAKER_05]: We gotta wrap up.

912
01:00:42,255 --> 01:00:44,795
[SPEAKER_05]: We gotta go around and get everybody's final thoughts so we can call it a night.

913
01:00:44,875 --> 01:00:46,396
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki, your final thought.

914
01:00:47,347 --> 01:00:47,788
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm tired.

915
01:00:48,690 --> 01:00:49,872
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, your final thought.

916
01:00:50,152 --> 01:00:52,336
[SPEAKER_01]: Reject false icons and get rid of the plague for me.

917
01:00:53,078 --> 01:00:55,021
[SPEAKER_05]: My final thought is Boy Play Woman.

918
01:00:55,742 --> 01:00:56,484
[SPEAKER_01]: Boy Play Woman!

919
01:00:57,737 --> 01:00:58,457
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll see you next week.

920
01:00:58,477 --> 01:00:59,998
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, we are going to do a show next week.

921
01:01:00,078 --> 01:01:09,724
[SPEAKER_05]: Even though it's Christmas, we're going to find some time to pre-record a show, maybe talk about some of the year's best, or at least our favorite for the year, and all sorts of other year-end things you would come to expect.

922
01:01:10,144 --> 01:01:13,526
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, as always, for giving a crap and listening to our show.

923
01:01:13,566 --> 01:01:16,848
[SPEAKER_05]: We really appreciate it, especially when we're indie and all that stuff.

924
01:01:17,209 --> 01:01:18,169
[SPEAKER_05]: We really appreciate it.

925
01:01:18,669 --> 01:01:22,532
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to give a shout-out real quick to our buddies over at GamePolitics.com.

926
01:01:23,192 --> 01:01:26,033
[SPEAKER_05]: because we kind of dropped the ball on something we said we were going to do for them.

927
01:01:26,193 --> 01:01:27,953
[SPEAKER_05]: We kind of weren't able to do it because of the plague.

928
01:01:28,693 --> 01:01:33,335
[SPEAKER_05]: So we want to say hi and sorry and go visit Game Politics because they're a great site.

929
01:01:33,395 --> 01:01:36,796
[SPEAKER_01]: Happy holidays, and we hope that your next year is drama-free.

930
01:01:36,976 --> 01:01:37,396
[SPEAKER_05]: That's right.

931
01:01:37,676 --> 01:01:37,976
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

932
01:01:39,236 --> 01:01:41,357
[SPEAKER_05]: Have a good one, and we'll see you next week.

933
01:01:41,557 --> 01:01:41,837
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay?

934
01:01:42,137 --> 01:01:42,397
[SPEAKER_05]: Bye-bye.

935
01:01:44,384 --> 01:01:47,948
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the end of another Orange Lounge Radio To Go edition.

936
01:01:48,268 --> 01:01:53,774
[SPEAKER_03]: This podcast is a proud part of www.orangeloungeradio.com.

937
01:01:54,215 --> 01:01:55,236
[SPEAKER_03]: See you next update.
