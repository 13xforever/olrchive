Now, here are your hosts, DarkSakura, Sky, and Loki.

00:17.800 --> 00:22.000
Hello, everybody out there in podcasting land.

00:23.000 --> 00:24.800
Or whatever your hometown happens to be.

00:24.800 --> 00:27.300
Do you think there's actually a town out there named Podcasting Land? Probably not.

00:27.300 --> 00:29.500
Well, there's Dish, Texas, so why not?

00:29.500 --> 00:32.500
Why not? I'd move to podcasting, Len.

00:32.500 --> 00:35.500
Um, you're listening to Orange Lounge Radio To Go.

00:35.500 --> 00:37.500
My name is Rob Roberts. You might know me as Sky.

00:37.500 --> 00:41.500
Joining me as always, the one and only Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers.

00:41.500 --> 00:42.500
Hi.

00:42.500 --> 00:43.500
How are you?

00:43.500 --> 00:44.500
I still have the plague.

00:44.500 --> 00:48.500
You? But you sound better. Have you had lots of liquid Vicodin and codeine and all that good stuff?

00:48.500 --> 00:50.500
Um, I drank codeine before the three hour show.

00:50.500 --> 00:51.500
Awesome.

00:51.500 --> 00:55.500
And, uh, I get to go home to sleep with Prince Vicodin.

00:55.500 --> 00:56.500
Sounds good.

00:56.500 --> 00:57.500
Yep.

00:57.500 --> 01:03.720
Loki is over there in the other corner. How you doing? Good. All right, the three of us joined together every week

01:03.940 --> 01:07.600
Well when dark soccer doesn't have the plague or you know, Loki Loki's

01:08.140 --> 01:13.020
Fiance is making him stay home to do the dishes or I'm out on a business trip or something

01:13.020 --> 01:17.300
We are here every week assembled to talk about games that do not suck

01:18.060 --> 01:23.420
But sometimes we do have to talk about a couple games that do suck or is has been the trend lately movies based on games

01:23.420 --> 01:26.780
that kind of suck such as blood rain seen the trailer for blood rain I'm

01:26.780 --> 01:31.340
actually gonna see it why why that's like $10 wasted because there's pretty

01:31.340 --> 01:35.980
men in it and there's also pretty prostitutes that are naked you know

01:35.980 --> 01:42.420
handy you are both vapid eyes oh listen I have to watch alone the dark and I

01:42.420 --> 01:46.540
also have to watch house of the dead before I see blood rain because I have

01:46.540 --> 01:50.260
to understand what I'm getting myself you have to complete the poop trilogy is

01:50.260 --> 01:57.460
What you have the dead was funny and awful and was in the name of the king a dungeon siege movie blows

01:57.460 --> 02:02.780
Ass is what the trailer sucked. Burt Reynolds looks really bored

02:03.900 --> 02:07.580
Well, anyway, probably weren't paying him enough before we got into that topic

02:07.580 --> 02:12.380
We're supposed to talk about what kind of games we've been playing this week because that's how we start off the show a little bit

02:12.380 --> 02:16.300
of a personal touch because damn we're important or at least we'd like to think

02:16.300 --> 02:22.260
we are dark Sakura who is most important what have you been playing this week you

02:22.260 --> 02:27.500
know good thing our listeners can't see this now now your husband would

02:27.500 --> 02:30.060
appreciate you flashing your titties at me I'm just kidding

02:30.060 --> 02:34.740
jokes jokes people it was your finger I'm not gonna say it all right well it's

02:34.740 --> 02:37.980
going through my mind I'm not gonna say don't let's not go back to the three

02:37.980 --> 02:42.500
hour show tonight please what kind of games you've been playing this week

02:42.500 --> 02:50.420
besides piss Rob off well like that's hard I've been really not playing much

02:50.420 --> 02:54.700
of anything because I've gone you know I've had the plague again all week which

02:54.700 --> 03:00.580
is fun but in a not really sort of way however for my husband's birthday which

03:00.580 --> 03:06.580
was Tuesday got him an Xbox 360 all right on and we've had days filled with

03:06.580 --> 03:11.980
Perfect Dark Zero, which is gorgeous. The new Ridge Racer is really, really nice.

03:11.980 --> 03:19.760
He's also been really into Project Gotham. Although for some reason he was playing

03:19.760 --> 03:34.800
Liberty City Grand Theft Auto on the PSP today. Also, I got to see, actually, the new Madden game, which was nice, if you like

03:34.800 --> 03:40.280
I'm not a big sports game fan, but the game looked pretty, but you know what?

03:40.280 --> 03:43.680
If I want to play football, give me some Tecmo Bowl.

03:43.680 --> 03:49.000
The NBA 2006, that actually looks kind of fun.

03:49.000 --> 03:52.080
You know, the most sports games I've enjoyed have been basketball.

03:52.080 --> 03:57.520
I mean, there's NBA Jam, loved NBA Jam back in the day, Double Dribble, you know, of course

03:57.520 --> 04:00.080
these are all like 15 year old games, but hey.

04:00.080 --> 04:02.600
Yeah, NBA Jam was a good game.

04:02.600 --> 04:09.080
to EA you can never have another NBA Jam well they can go ahead all right yeah

04:09.080 --> 04:14.180
but um I do have to say that Mike Bibby did not look like himself in that game

04:14.180 --> 04:18.220
that was a very bad version of him however Arco Arena looked very nice

04:18.220 --> 04:22.240
because of course the first game Dan did was Lakers versus Kings of course as

04:22.240 --> 04:29.920
most people in this area would do I did play some more katamari just cuz and of

04:29.920 --> 04:34.300
course it made me uber motion sick because I've been sick anyway um I

04:34.300 --> 04:38.940
turned on World of Warcraft again and then promptly left the room why is that

04:38.940 --> 04:42.520
just I forgot about it I had to do something and it came back Oh World of

04:42.520 --> 04:49.560
Warcraft there's something shiny that's my shiny thing and I just haven't had

04:49.560 --> 04:55.160
you know I've also had to go back to school and work and well Animal Crossing

04:55.160 --> 04:58.880
this week you know make some time for it I know you're oh yeah my breaks are no

04:58.880 --> 05:02.280
longer going to be spent on my book so they're going to be spent on playing

05:02.280 --> 05:07.440
Animal Crossing. Me you buy cracks three o'clock bring your bug net

05:07.440 --> 05:11.640
that's all I have to say. Oh hell yeah. It's on. Just wait till I put some signs

05:11.640 --> 05:18.680
in your village. Alright Loki what's on your mind? As far as games goes I don't

05:18.680 --> 05:20.880
care about what else is on your mind I just want to know games. Well I've been

05:20.880 --> 05:27.560
playing Grand Theft Auto Liberty City Stories the usual by workday game that

05:27.560 --> 05:34.240
we play, and I've been kicking the crap out of everybody because I fucking rock. And then

05:34.240 --> 05:40.240
also I've been playing Matrix Path of Neo, and that was pretty cool. It's actually kind

05:40.240 --> 05:45.440
of a lot deeper than the first game, and it covers, you know, the events in the movie,

05:45.440 --> 05:49.320
but it goes way further into them, and you get to do alternate things like what would

05:49.320 --> 05:53.720
have happened if, you know, Neo had actually gotten out of the office building instead

05:53.720 --> 05:59.080
of being captured and that type of stuff, which is kind of cool and they throw stuff

05:59.080 --> 06:03.440
from the movie in there as well, which is a pretty well done game.

06:03.440 --> 06:07.220
And I like how you can select your difficulty in the beginning, how it just gets progressively

06:07.220 --> 06:12.280
harder and then you select it off of that.

06:12.280 --> 06:15.080
I don't like the fact that the cameras are really slow.

06:15.080 --> 06:18.900
Like you changing the camera around, it moves too slow, and I can't get it to go faster

06:18.900 --> 06:21.760
and so I get a lot of awkward camera shots with that.

06:21.760 --> 06:25.600
I don't know, it's pretty good and then it gets really hard, really hard really fast.

06:25.600 --> 06:29.320
Like, there was this guy who was pointing a gun at me and said freeze, so I ran away

06:29.320 --> 06:30.320
and he shot me.

06:30.320 --> 06:37.000
So, you know, I probably should listen to him, but, you know, so be it.

06:37.000 --> 06:41.760
Then, what else have I been playing, let's see here, Cloud, I've been playing this free

06:41.760 --> 06:45.040
game online called Cloud, and it's-

06:45.040 --> 06:49.960
I think I saw a story over on Dig or something about that game, what's this all about?

06:49.960 --> 06:56.320
a free game that's put out. You can go to the website, www.cloudthegame.com, and it's

06:56.320 --> 06:59.640
supposedly a game that's supposed to make you cry, I guess.

06:59.640 --> 07:02.240
Wait, this game's gonna make me cry?

07:02.240 --> 07:03.240
Supposedly.

07:03.240 --> 07:04.240
Why?

07:04.240 --> 07:07.720
I guess because the content, I think it talks about, um, some kids-

07:07.720 --> 07:13.640
Is it gonna chop onions live in front of me, or what- is it gonna show me hideous images

07:13.640 --> 07:17.000
from the things in our history and stuff that-

07:17.000 --> 07:19.040
Going to play Politary on repeat.

07:19.040 --> 07:24.680
Um, let's see here, and actually maybe it isn't cloudthegame.com, but I have the link

07:24.680 --> 07:25.680
right here.

07:25.680 --> 07:30.520
Um, it's just a pretty fun game, um, definitely worth checking it out, especially since it's

07:30.520 --> 07:33.440
a free download, you can't really go wrong with that.

07:33.440 --> 07:39.040
Um, but, yeah, it's um, actually thatcloudgame.com was the...

07:39.040 --> 07:40.040
Thatcloudgame.

07:40.040 --> 07:42.680
Not to be confused with Final Fantasy VII Cloud.

07:42.680 --> 07:51.180
It's created by the Game Innovation students from Game Innovation who created it and it's

07:51.180 --> 07:56.060
a division of Interactive Media at University of Southern California School of Cinema and

07:56.060 --> 08:00.800
Television and it's actually pretty awesome.

08:00.800 --> 08:05.860
They've got a little FAQ here about it and it's just a really well done game.

08:05.860 --> 08:06.860
It's kind of fun.

08:06.860 --> 08:11.580
It's kind of like Katamari and it's more of a puzzle game but it's free and it's free.

08:11.580 --> 08:12.580
What else do you know?

08:12.580 --> 08:19.060
relaxing. There's not really any time limits or anything. It's just kind of you build clouds,

08:19.060 --> 08:23.980
you start off, you gather clouds and you can kind of suck them up and then you can kind

08:23.980 --> 08:28.640
of spit them back out again and create like taller clouds to pick up even bigger clouds

08:28.640 --> 08:30.780
and then you can make stuff rain and stuff like that.

08:30.780 --> 08:33.220
Okay, I'm still not driven to tears here.

08:33.220 --> 08:39.280
Well, I don't know what it is, but it's a cool game. So thatcloudgame.com, go check

08:39.280 --> 08:40.280
it out.

08:40.280 --> 08:43.620
playing cloud the game I seriously want to hear from you to go at orange

08:43.620 --> 08:47.900
calm I don't know if you're so freaking sad about this game I don't know it's

08:47.900 --> 08:52.160
it's kind of got the sad music into it and it's gotten like the very being

08:52.160 --> 08:55.280
talking about this kid who stopped taking his meds and so you kind of get

08:55.280 --> 08:59.840
the I get the feeling maybe he's dead or something like that okay that's kind of

08:59.840 --> 09:04.140
sad Oh most gamers have cold black hearts after playing doom 3 for hours on

09:04.140 --> 09:09.180
end you know so what I don't know but it's it's well done the arts really good

09:09.180 --> 09:16.340
And it runs on almost you know most PC's nowadays. It doesn't require like a huge graphics card or anything so I

09:16.860 --> 09:18.860
Would definitely check it out

09:19.780 --> 09:23.820
My gaming week, I'm gonna be honest guys. I haven't really played a whole lot of new stuff this week

09:24.060 --> 09:30.020
There's really not have been a whole lot out there new that I've wanted to check out plus. You know because we are

09:30.900 --> 09:34.980
Gamers who oftentimes except in Loki's case because he gets hooked up through work

09:34.980 --> 09:37.460
We have to pay for our own games ourselves

09:37.460 --> 09:40.900
So I've just been trying to save all the money this week because you know, I am gonna get the Xbox 360

09:41.700 --> 09:45.140
Sometime probably after Christmas. So I'm kind of saving my money's there. Yeah

09:45.860 --> 09:51.940
Yeah, I don't I know I'm not gonna whenever you find them. That's fine. I'm told I can't afford one before Christmas anyway

09:52.860 --> 09:57.460
But there are some of the games I want to check out that are coming out including Animal Crossing this week

09:57.660 --> 10:04.060
Final Fantasy Advance 4 or Final Fantasy 4 advanced which I believe was is this week or was last week

10:04.060 --> 10:06.780
I guess this week. Yeah, it's very very soon. I know that and

10:07.220 --> 10:11.540
That's pretty much all I all I'm that's on my must playlist between now and Christmas

10:11.780 --> 10:15.940
Otherwise, I'll just kind of check things out as I play them or come across them. They look cool

10:16.340 --> 10:20.500
Otherwise for me, honestly, it's been a lot of Dragon Quest 8 which I talked about last week already

10:21.220 --> 10:28.260
Great game. I'm loving it. It's an old style RPG and it's just it's it's what I remember from the great Super Nintendo

10:28.260 --> 10:31.700
It kind of is a throwback to the Super Nintendo RPGs. It's holding my attention

10:31.700 --> 10:35.480
attention and that's pretty much it I've just a lot of stuff going on in my

10:35.480 --> 10:39.140
personal life so can't do a lot of games this week but next week for sure Animal

10:39.140 --> 10:43.600
Crossing and probably Final Fantasy I will definitely be all up on that let's

10:43.600 --> 10:47.840
get into some gaming news shall we let's talk about you know speaking of things

10:47.840 --> 10:51.600
that are like 15 years old I know this is an odd thing to lead off as the top

10:51.600 --> 10:55.640
story but damn this was so weird look you've got to tell me about what you saw

10:55.640 --> 11:00.440
in this message forum about a chip that's very old what is going on with

11:00.440 --> 11:09.440
Well, at benhecht.com, because you've got to love that stuff, they were talking about how they've overclocked the Super FX chip.

11:09.440 --> 11:18.440
And for those who might not remember, that's the chip that was in those wonderful 3D games back in Star Fox and Stunt Race FX.

11:18.440 --> 11:23.440
Off-Road? Yeah. Oh, no. There was an Off-Road game that had it, too. I think there was another driving game.

11:23.440 --> 11:24.440
I don't remember.

11:24.440 --> 11:25.440
Whatever, who cares.

11:25.440 --> 11:28.440
Yeah, Stunt Race FX was that stupid, stupid, stupid game.

11:28.440 --> 11:29.440
Maybe I'm getting it confused.

11:29.440 --> 11:34.440
Anyways, I had a bunch of other stuff, and what they've done is there's a timing chip

11:34.440 --> 11:39.680
that's on this actual, if you rip the card apart and actually look at the circuit board,

11:39.680 --> 11:42.840
and what they've done is replace that with a different chip.

11:42.840 --> 11:52.240
And what that has done is actually now things are moving faster, it's less lag, so when

11:52.240 --> 11:57.280
they get to a scene with lots of enemies in the background it does not slow down, just

11:57.280 --> 12:01.180
frame rate and stuff which is kind of neat because you gotta love everybody

12:01.180 --> 12:07.520
hacking stuff I don't know this is weird that this is so old yet people are still

12:07.520 --> 12:12.840
messing with this stuff it's just kind of kind of neat diehard fan stuff it's

12:12.840 --> 12:18.000
cool yeah I would if I wasn't afraid I would screw up my super honestly I don't

12:18.000 --> 12:20.640
even have a working Super Nintendo anymore if I wasn't afraid I would screw

12:20.640 --> 12:25.080
up a valuable Star Fox cartridge by doing this it almost sounds like fun

12:25.080 --> 12:30.220
well except that you can find them for $2 at the thrift store I thought they

12:30.220 --> 12:33.780
were worth more than that well cray are but if you look at the thrift store

12:33.780 --> 12:39.020
they'll sell really well you know I see copies of what was it Casey munchkin

12:39.020 --> 12:44.900
uh-huh on some of those auctions selling for a little bit more yeah I bought my

12:44.900 --> 12:49.020
copies several of them for 99 cents at the store because they don't know the

12:49.020 --> 12:52.980
real value of that exactly yeah and people who just donate bags and bags

12:52.980 --> 12:59.600
interesting all right let's talk about some news going on with Final Fantasy 12

12:59.600 --> 13:02.620
Dark Sakura what do you know about what's going on with a release in Japan

13:02.620 --> 13:08.780
well I know they're planning on charging a bit more for it typically ps2 games

13:08.780 --> 13:17.980
retail for about a 7,410 yen however they're saying that the launch price is

13:17.980 --> 13:26.600
gonna be eight thousand nine ninety ouch which is about yeah 85 86 bucks Wow but

13:26.600 --> 13:31.060
games are typically more expensive in Japan anyway right that's not a big but

13:31.060 --> 13:34.060
if you're gonna report this you're you're gonna be paying that they're

13:34.060 --> 13:38.460
they're popping the price up on that one just for conversions sake that's about

13:38.460 --> 13:43.520
43 pounds amazing now what do you think that's gonna have an effect on the

13:43.520 --> 13:46.460
release here do you think that we're gonna be end up paying a real high-end

13:46.460 --> 13:51.700
end price such as $59.99 for this? Well Squenix hasn't commented on anything

13:51.700 --> 13:57.900
but I'm thinking it's probably gonna be a likelihood. At least bank on $49.99 if

13:57.900 --> 14:03.260
nothing else. Well also though they're doing a pre-release with a CD single of

14:03.260 --> 14:08.500
the whatever their image song is gonna be called a Kibo which is a hope. Oh. And

14:08.500 --> 14:12.460
it's going to come with the DVD featuring footage of the game and

14:12.460 --> 14:18.620
interviews with Hakase and the price on that one's going to be 1,680 yen hmm

14:18.620 --> 14:24.220
now did you hear about this when they release this in Japan on March 16th

14:24.220 --> 14:29.020
actually Squeenix teamed up with somebody called Suntory who makes these

14:29.020 --> 14:33.620
drinks these basically herbal drinks they're gonna release Final Fantasy 12

14:33.620 --> 14:38.420
potion there are these blue crystal drink looking things that are basically

14:38.420 --> 14:43.680
like like you know the power drinks we have here in America the buku and the

14:43.680 --> 14:47.660
rock star and Red Bull being the pride the most popular of them all it's

14:47.660 --> 14:51.600
basically something like that except they say this will be a mysterious

14:51.600 --> 14:56.000
flavor the potion and will be made from various herbs and of course they're

14:56.000 --> 14:59.920
gonna do all these lame tie-ins about you know it'll regenerate your HP with

14:59.920 --> 15:03.760
all the herbal goodness wah wah wah stuff like that I don't know you think

15:03.760 --> 15:08.400
that's something that could work over here final fantasy potion well looking

15:08.400 --> 15:13.280
at the ingredients in it though hyssop and lemon balm they are okay I worked at

15:13.280 --> 15:17.880
GNC for a very long time and an herb shop sure yeah those are fairly sedative

15:17.880 --> 15:23.520
herbs I'd have to see the ingredient list the full list but I would buy it

15:23.520 --> 15:27.080
you know instead of having an energy drink why not have a drink that relaxes

15:27.080 --> 15:31.520
you I think it's a good idea okay okay although I don't think I need my HP to

15:31.520 --> 15:37.360
go up anymore I you know even I have the plague this will be the rage at anime

15:37.360 --> 15:41.440
conventions seriously that the kid who imports a case of this if they don't end

15:41.440 --> 15:46.880
up releasing it here a kid who imports the case of this will be the the most

15:46.880 --> 15:51.040
loved at the anime conventions oh I got my push it had the thing about the

15:51.040 --> 15:55.920
premium box bundle right yeah with the specially designed bottle and the final

15:55.920 --> 15:59.600
fantasy 12 art museum card.

15:59.600 --> 16:00.400
Very cool.

16:00.400 --> 16:01.520
Lucky, what do you think?

16:01.520 --> 16:02.200
Potion?

16:02.200 --> 16:02.720
Good thing?

16:02.720 --> 16:03.520
I'm not buying it.

16:03.520 --> 16:05.800
I don't buy those energy drinks anyway, so.

16:05.800 --> 16:06.920
It's not an energy drink.

16:06.920 --> 16:07.840
It's a calming drink.

16:07.840 --> 16:08.560
Well, whatever.

16:08.560 --> 16:09.840
I still buy that stuff.

16:09.840 --> 16:11.960
If it's got herbs in it, forget it.

16:11.960 --> 16:16.600
When they release a drink called Ether, wake me up.

16:16.600 --> 16:18.640
Moving on to other stories.

16:18.640 --> 16:21.920
What's going on with WoW?

16:21.920 --> 16:25.240
We were talking about hacking the Super FX.

16:25.240 --> 16:30.000
what's what's being hacked a World of Warcraft Jamie well we have super hot

16:30.000 --> 16:38.280
triple X new to orcs yeah someone basically hacked it to have all the

16:38.280 --> 16:43.120
female characters orcs humans gnomes night elves dwarves trolls undead

16:43.120 --> 16:49.400
whatever get naked but blizzards probably gonna be of course cracking

16:49.400 --> 16:52.240
down on that one so the only way you can get it would probably be on a private

16:52.240 --> 16:56.600
server. You knew this shit would happen eventually. It's because people are perverts. Release

16:56.600 --> 17:01.280
a video game for the computer with a woman in it and somebody will get her naked. Troll

17:01.280 --> 17:05.840
boobies! There's nothing they can do. There's nothing they can do. Especially when WoW is

17:05.840 --> 17:11.280
so patch friendly anyway. I mean mine is bogged down with all these patches like the auctioneer

17:11.280 --> 17:17.200
and the ones that show you how long estimated to get to your next level and just all this

17:17.200 --> 17:21.080
crap on there that makes the game take forever to load. But since Blizzard is so friendly

17:21.080 --> 17:25.440
it's supporting this stuff, whereas other games, Final Fantasy XI, do not support these

17:25.440 --> 17:28.880
things, it kind of makes it easier for these types of patches to go into effect.

17:28.880 --> 17:34.280
People have been modding Final Fantasy XI to do this already, I mean...

17:34.280 --> 17:40.040
It's not a surprise, I'm just saying, Blizzard kind of embracing it makes it easier to be

17:40.040 --> 17:41.960
a more prevalent thing, if that makes any sense.

17:41.960 --> 17:44.080
They're just re-skinning the characters, that's all.

17:44.080 --> 17:45.080
I know.

17:45.080 --> 17:49.480
That's what makes it so easy, almost anyone could get a woman or a man naked in a video

17:49.480 --> 17:55.280
game or an alien whatever whatever tickles your fancy speaking of Nintendo

17:55.280 --> 18:01.200
which we're talking about a little bit ago Smash Brothers the creator of the

18:01.200 --> 18:06.480
Smash Brothers series has said in the latest issue of the Japanese game Bible

18:06.480 --> 18:12.240
Famitsu what's going to happen is that a mashahiro Sakurai is actually coming

18:12.240 --> 18:17.080
back to Nintendo after being gone for two years saying that he will be doing a

18:17.080 --> 18:21.920
New Super Smash Brothers game for the revolution to which many Nintendo fanboys are cheering

18:21.920 --> 18:27.220
I think this was kind of a given that there were definitely have to be some type of Smash Brothers on revolution one word

18:28.040 --> 18:33.000
Hit from actually no this forwards pit from kid Icarus. Okay. Thanks. We need pit

18:33.640 --> 18:36.880
Absolutely or eggplant wizard. Yeah, I was gonna say we need a put was her

18:36.880 --> 18:40.280
We know who we need actually so we need we need us a mega man

18:40.280 --> 18:46.600
But that's not Nintendo. That's Capcom. Well then we need somebody to make friends at Capcom.

18:46.600 --> 18:51.680
I don't know why, well I was just, I had it in my head though thinking, it was another character

18:51.680 --> 18:58.200
I'm trying to think of that was, I don't know, what if we have Nintendogs? They come out as

18:58.200 --> 19:05.280
helpers. The Dalmatians start ripping Mario flesh, oh god, alright. Oh no, ammonia burn!

19:05.280 --> 19:10.280
Or Animal Crossing, KK Slider comes and whacks you with his guitar.

19:10.280 --> 19:12.280
Uh, we need Rob the Robot.

19:12.280 --> 19:16.280
Maybe? He got some love in Mario Kart, why not?

19:16.280 --> 19:18.280
I think Waluigi is a given.

19:18.280 --> 19:21.280
I just think it was awesome that we had Mr. Saturn in the last one.

19:21.280 --> 19:22.280
That was pretty cool.

19:22.280 --> 19:23.280
From Earthbound.

19:23.280 --> 19:27.280
I thought the Game and Watch thing was a clever little addition.

19:27.280 --> 19:29.280
I need Fred Savage from the Wizard.

19:29.280 --> 19:31.280
Alright, you guys are lame.

19:31.280 --> 19:35.800
All right, one of the accessories weapons you get is a power glove

19:37.280 --> 19:39.500
Lame lame lame. No way

19:40.140 --> 19:43.360
Let's talk about some games that are coming out like within this

19:43.360 --> 19:48.600
Oh, actually no before we get to that Nintendo in the UK is doing something kind of interesting

19:50.320 --> 19:57.400
Well, there are downloadable ringtones available that is if you are a member of their little club thing

19:57.400 --> 19:59.180
They have the Nintendo VIP

19:59.180 --> 20:04.080
24-7 club you'll be able to after tomorrow after December 5th

20:04.180 --> 20:10.680
You will be able to turn in your stars that you've collected to buy ringtones from the Nintendo of Europe website

20:11.700 --> 20:16.100
They said they've got 20 to choose from there's the Legend of Zelda Metroid Prime

20:17.000 --> 20:19.000
Super Mario Brothers

20:19.700 --> 20:22.900
They say there are 350 stars each

20:22.900 --> 20:30.520
but there's also mobile wallpapers too at 150 stars apiece they're saying though

20:30.520 --> 20:36.240
that you have to update your user profile by entering in your mobile

20:36.240 --> 20:40.800
number your phone's make a model you basically follow the instructions it's

20:40.800 --> 20:43.720
kind of similar to what they do on the US side because I actually finally

20:43.720 --> 20:47.260
signed up for the US Nintendo thing because you know well with the new

20:47.260 --> 20:50.600
console coming out in the DS Wi-Fi I kind of wanted to get on board with

20:50.600 --> 20:54.440
with whatever promotional things they might be doing, so I went and I pulled all my DS

20:54.440 --> 20:58.680
games and I registered them all with Nintendo's site, so hopefully I'll get some free crap.

20:58.680 --> 20:59.680
I don't know, we'll see.

20:59.680 --> 21:03.400
Yeah, I remember when I did that, you know, back in the day when they were giving away

21:03.400 --> 21:08.000
that Zelda, you know, where it's the Zelda 1 and 2 and then, um...

21:08.000 --> 21:09.000
You didn't get shit, did you?

21:09.000 --> 21:10.160
No, I didn't get shit.

21:10.160 --> 21:13.320
And I qualified for it and they said they were gonna send it and they didn't send it,

21:13.320 --> 21:14.320
so...

21:14.320 --> 21:15.320
Aw, maybe somebody stole it.

21:15.320 --> 21:17.320
Maybe I stole it, because you were living with me at the time.

21:17.320 --> 21:18.320
No.

21:18.320 --> 21:19.320
Alright.

21:19.320 --> 21:24.920
So they've just launched a new WAP portal for your mobile.

21:24.920 --> 21:28.680
You go to wap.nintendo.co.uk.

21:28.680 --> 21:29.680
Very cool.

21:29.680 --> 21:31.260
All right.

21:31.260 --> 21:36.760
Let's move on and let's talk about, I've got a quick story here about Children of Mana.

21:36.760 --> 21:42.640
This is also a second Densetsu DS, it's going to be coming out February 23rd in Japan, don't

21:42.640 --> 21:47.320
know about here yet, estimated $42 when you convert the dollars over there.

21:47.320 --> 21:53.120
No stateside release announced yet, but honestly guys, I think it's pretty much a given that

21:53.120 --> 21:55.280
this game will be making its way over here.

21:55.280 --> 21:58.940
I would guess maybe next summer, next Christmas, I think is a fair guess.

21:58.940 --> 21:59.940
Who knows?

21:59.940 --> 22:02.240
It's all up to Squeenix and whatever they want to do.

22:02.240 --> 22:05.720
But for those of you guys who like to import, you can do that on February 23rd, this latest

22:05.720 --> 22:07.400
entry from Japan.

22:07.400 --> 22:13.240
Loki, you have something that a lot of gamers might want on their wishlist this Christmas

22:13.240 --> 22:17.720
if you got about, what, $800, $1,000 to spare to get arcade games in your home, what's this

22:17.720 --> 22:18.720
about?

22:18.720 --> 22:19.720
That's less than that.

22:19.720 --> 22:20.720
Oh, wow.

22:20.720 --> 22:21.720
Oh, good.

22:21.720 --> 22:24.320
Yeah, first off, there's a couple places you can get arcade games.

22:24.320 --> 22:31.880
One of them being at Costco, and they're selling kind of a better package, but it's for about

22:31.880 --> 22:42.520
I think $2,000, you can get a full-size, I'm sorry, $2,299, you get a 2006 Ultimate Arcade

22:42.520 --> 22:47.520
stand-up unit. Now I'm not going to be confused with the Ultimate Arcade cabinet, which is

22:47.520 --> 22:54.520
something I built for mine. But anyways, it comes with 81 games, all from Atari and others

22:54.520 --> 22:59.940
including Golden Tee and stuff. It's covered in different logos like Capcom and stuff which

22:59.940 --> 23:06.940
is kind of odd seeing as there's all Atari games in there. Huge list of stuff. Actually,

23:06.940 --> 23:12.940
It does include, looks like other games, they have Ghouls and Ghosts, Golden Teeth, those

23:12.940 --> 23:18.140
people who like golf stuff, Mega Man, Street Fighter.

23:18.140 --> 23:23.660
So basically you're going to pay for MAME, basically.

23:23.660 --> 23:25.100
So that's interesting.

23:25.100 --> 23:29.180
Now if you're not looking to spend $2,300 on something, Target has something more of

23:29.180 --> 23:30.720
your price.

23:30.720 --> 23:37.820
Their cabinet, which sports a whopping 12 games, all from Midway, is $397, which is

23:37.820 --> 23:38.820
not bad for a game.

23:38.820 --> 23:42.620
Yeah, considering that you could probably gut that thing and do something else with

23:42.620 --> 23:43.860
it, not a bad price.

23:43.860 --> 23:46.460
Yeah, that's not a bad price if you want to gut it.

23:46.460 --> 23:51.540
Now, granted, it is a little bit tiny, but it includes such wonderful things as Joust,

23:51.540 --> 23:58.740
Defender, 1-2, Robotron, Rampage, Splat, Satan's Hollow, Root Beer Tapper, Bubbles, Wizard

23:58.740 --> 24:00.460
of War, Timber, and Cinestar.

24:00.460 --> 24:03.860
You know, hats off to Midway, they know how to milk their old shit.

24:03.860 --> 24:04.860
They really do.

24:04.860 --> 24:05.860
Sinistar is awesome.

24:05.860 --> 24:07.540
They know how to get the most out of their old stuff.

24:07.540 --> 24:08.540
So that's not bad.

24:08.540 --> 24:12.300
Of course you can just do what we did and gut a pole position machine and put a computer

24:12.300 --> 24:15.180
in it and buy an arcade monitor.

24:15.180 --> 24:16.180
Awesome.

24:16.180 --> 24:17.180
Alright.

24:17.180 --> 24:21.580
DarkSakura, tell us what's in our mailbag.

24:21.580 --> 24:25.300
Let's go open up the old mailbag and see what's going on with the listeners.

24:25.300 --> 24:27.540
Of course you guys can always send us an email if you want.

24:27.540 --> 24:32.900
ToGo at OrangeLoungeRadio.com is the place to send those emails, and we'll read them

24:32.900 --> 24:34.540
and respond to them when we feel like it.

24:34.540 --> 24:35.540
No, just kidding.

24:35.540 --> 24:38.580
Dark Soccer always is very good about writing people back.

24:38.580 --> 24:41.620
Got a flood of email from Rob.

24:41.620 --> 24:42.620
One email?

24:42.620 --> 24:43.620
One email?

24:43.620 --> 24:44.620
A flood of them.

24:44.620 --> 24:45.620
Oh my gosh.

24:45.620 --> 24:46.620
From Rob.

24:46.620 --> 24:47.620
With two B's.

24:47.620 --> 24:48.620
Not this Rob.

24:48.620 --> 24:49.620
No.

24:49.620 --> 24:50.620
No.

24:50.620 --> 24:51.620
Rob him.

24:51.620 --> 24:52.620
Well, he's our buddy.

24:52.620 --> 24:53.620
He keeps us in the know.

24:53.620 --> 24:54.620
I appreciate him.

24:54.620 --> 24:56.860
couple of these

24:56.860 --> 25:03.280
there's a little bit about a a bonus for the Xbox 360 a

25:04.900 --> 25:06.900
USB

25:07.340 --> 25:09.100
Adapter oh

25:09.100 --> 25:15.620
The wireless thing right I heard about this I kind of taken a good idea from the Nintendo DS. Honestly, but hey hey

25:16.220 --> 25:18.220
works and

25:18.220 --> 25:23.220
Apparently what you can do with this, you can hook up a USB hard drive to your 360.

25:23.220 --> 25:26.220
Oh, interesting, okay.

25:26.220 --> 25:34.220
It says on the actually linked website, all you need is the following hard drive of your choice.

25:34.220 --> 25:40.220
It says the drive is not important as long as you can get a USB 2.0 adapter for that type of drive.

25:40.220 --> 25:45.220
And then a USB 2.0 to ATA adapter for the type of drive you will be using.

25:45.220 --> 25:49.220
It's, uh, pretty neat stuff.

25:49.220 --> 25:50.220
Interesting.

25:50.220 --> 25:57.220
Um, also, uh, in other e-mail here, as soon as I get back to, uh, reach my hand back in

25:57.220 --> 26:00.220
the bag, um, a little bit about the, uh,

26:00.220 --> 26:02.220
That's not the mailbag.

26:02.220 --> 26:05.220
Dot, dot, dot.

26:05.220 --> 26:06.220
Go ahead.

26:06.220 --> 26:09.220
ESRB is up to their, uh, old crap again.

26:09.220 --> 26:10.220
Yay.

26:10.220 --> 26:11.220
Um,

26:11.220 --> 26:13.620
Well, that's a good thing, though, because they've got to fend off all this other stuff

26:13.620 --> 26:14.620
going on, right?

26:14.620 --> 26:19.740
In a way kind of maybe that will they posted an article here

26:22.540 --> 26:24.540
Just

26:26.000 --> 26:30.400
Let me see if I can get that back up again, I accidentally closed the link. Oh, that's right

26:33.160 --> 26:35.160
And it's taking forever to load, okay

26:35.560 --> 26:40.840
Yeah, just to read back the title of this ESRB game retailers decried bad report card. Oh

26:40.840 --> 26:45.400
Oh, yeah, I heard about this they got they got a report card from one of those watchdog

26:45.780 --> 26:49.740
Association thing. Yeah, I was reading a little bit on this. Well, this is how they were

27:04.940 --> 27:06.940
and

27:08.140 --> 27:13.680
The only reason they got that F in ratings accuracy is because that Grand Theft Auto things slipped through and I still say to this day

27:14.540 --> 27:19.300
Rockstar did not intend for that to get out. It was a lazy programming thing. It was a lazy programming thing

27:19.300 --> 27:23.720
It's a they never thought they would have to do huh, but there was just you know

27:23.720 --> 27:30.820
I love this comment here parents exercising responsibility by not buying games intended for 17 year olds for their 10 year old

27:31.460 --> 27:33.460
F

27:33.460 --> 27:36.900
Definitely need to be on there.

27:36.900 --> 27:41.460
You know, I'm gonna go ahead

27:41.460 --> 27:45.700
this article is actually on the Ars Technica website.

27:45.700 --> 27:51.860
It really needs to be given a read by many of our listeners just because

27:51.860 --> 27:56.460
it goes into a lot of, it's a pretty lengthy article, it goes into a lot of details

27:56.460 --> 28:01.540
but I do think that it makes a pretty good point with the

28:01.540 --> 28:05.660
the points going back and forth between the different facilities that are

28:05.660 --> 28:06.580
arguing about

28:06.580 --> 28:09.980
you know for the ratings or against the ratings or how effective they are

28:09.980 --> 28:13.500
you know I honestly think that the ratings themselves

28:13.500 --> 28:16.740
are pretty accurate

28:16.740 --> 28:20.500
I would say. It's just the fact that parents just don't

28:20.500 --> 28:25.460
look. They don't care. Interesting. You know this is going to tie into a story I have coming

28:25.460 --> 28:29.860
up as soon as you're done with mail so. Okay. Is that it? Was that it for mail?

28:29.860 --> 28:37.780
uh no no okay oh no okay um there's also another one he linked about um

28:39.700 --> 28:47.140
about 400,000 xbox 360s being sold um what how what

28:48.340 --> 28:53.060
they are really in those numbers is that how many they really put out on shells is that maybe 400,000

28:53.060 --> 29:03.060
worldwide? No, they're estimating 400,000 launched in the U.S., 300,000 in the UK. Wow.

29:03.060 --> 29:08.140
I don't know, it just seems like nobody I know has one. So, maybe a couple people online

29:08.140 --> 29:14.380
I know, but nobody I know has one, whereas like everybody I know has PS2s, well whatever,

29:14.380 --> 29:20.100
who cares. It's just a launch. And you know, this crap about them not having the systems,

29:20.100 --> 29:23.340
I'm sorry that's so much utter crap. How so?

29:23.340 --> 29:27.380
Just because I don't know

29:27.380 --> 29:30.140
how fast they're manufacturing or maybe it's because they're trying to

29:30.140 --> 29:32.060
manufacture them so quick is why they're

29:32.060 --> 29:35.220
such you know kinda bad quality

29:35.220 --> 29:39.340
you know why so many of them are having issues even you know my Xbox has issues

29:39.340 --> 29:42.940
it froze like three times while we were playing

29:42.940 --> 29:47.620
Ridge Racer 6. This is why I'm glad I decided to wait a little bit maybe they'll work some of this

29:47.620 --> 29:49.700
stuff out in 2006 I don't know

29:49.700 --> 29:55.500
probably gonna end up I don't know trading ours in you know after there's I

29:55.500 --> 29:59.420
suppose a more plentiful supply available right but I honestly do you

29:59.420 --> 30:04.060
think that they've been sitting on more than they say they've got hmm I mean

30:04.060 --> 30:08.220
maybe they're referring to pre-sales maybe they're referring to oh that now

30:08.220 --> 30:11.340
that could be it if you count in like pre-sales and stuff maybe there's still

30:11.340 --> 30:14.940
people waiting for it I don't know it's actually how many little launched with

30:14.940 --> 30:20.740
400,000 and this is it hitting I just I don't think it's either all estimates

30:20.740 --> 30:26.300
all right yeah I want to wait for actual numbers I don't buy this we'll see

30:26.300 --> 30:33.980
estimate thing all right anything else there were a few others but we'll go

30:33.980 --> 30:37.700
ahead to whatever you had okay well I want to do a quick follow because this

30:37.700 --> 30:40.980
is kind of a big story that's been going around speaking about you know ESRB and

30:40.980 --> 30:44.220
the video game violence all that stuff has been like the hot-button issue of

30:44.220 --> 30:51.340
2005 here. Hillary Rodham Clinton and Joseph Lieberman have kind of come

30:51.340 --> 30:55.460
together to talk about this bill that they are going to propose when Congress

30:55.460 --> 31:00.780
reconvenes in two weeks. It's the Family Entertainment Protection Act and it will

31:00.780 --> 31:06.700
pretty much be suggesting that we govern a few things. Step one, basically that

31:06.700 --> 31:12.340
it's going to be trying to get businesses to not sell a mature adults

31:12.340 --> 31:16.480
only or ratings pending game to a person who's younger than 17. First thing I

31:16.480 --> 31:21.060
should note is that this bill, contrary to the California bill that was passed

31:21.060 --> 31:25.860
on to bills, actually embraces the ESRB rating system and sort of uses that as

31:25.860 --> 31:30.340
the guide as to, you know, what they consider mature and what's not. And for

31:30.340 --> 31:34.700
that I kind of say I applaud this bill where other bills I think have kind of

31:34.700 --> 31:37.900
failed is that the other bills made it, at least the California one that I was

31:37.900 --> 31:43.220
pretty familiar with, made it way too vague what exactly a mature game is.

31:43.220 --> 31:46.280
This makes the board do it, which I think is kind of interesting.

31:46.280 --> 31:50.240
Step two, calls for mandated yearly review, okay?

31:50.240 --> 31:58.700
Step three, the FTC, Federal Trade Commission, can conduct an investigation when a misconsistencies

31:58.700 --> 32:03.580
happen, as they will do with Grand Theft Auto, San Andreas, to see if it was done purposefully,

32:03.580 --> 32:06.600
which I do truly believe they will find it was not.

32:07.940 --> 32:10.100
Step four, consumers can file complaints

32:10.100 --> 32:12.900
with the Federal Trade Commission when they disagree,

32:12.900 --> 32:16.920
and then the FTC would also be audited regularly

32:16.920 --> 32:21.060
to make sure that the ESRB's doing their job and everything.

32:21.060 --> 32:26.060
I actually, although I do believe the bottom line is that

32:27.600 --> 32:29.940
parents should ultimately be responsible

32:29.940 --> 32:31.900
for what the F they're buying for their kids,

32:31.900 --> 32:34.540
I do think this bill is better

32:34.540 --> 32:36.400
and a step in the right direction

32:36.400 --> 32:37.860
from things that we've seen in the past

32:37.860 --> 32:41.140
because what this does is it sets up a board,

32:41.140 --> 32:43.620
well the board, it uses a preexisting board

32:43.620 --> 32:46.020
that already rates the games and it audits that board.

32:46.020 --> 32:47.780
And I don't see there's any problem with the auditing

32:47.780 --> 32:49.140
as long as everything's fair.

32:49.140 --> 32:51.740
It's a system of balancing and checking everything,

32:51.740 --> 32:55.040
make sure everything is running as it should be.

32:55.040 --> 32:57.100
And I don't think that's necessarily a bad thing.

32:57.100 --> 32:59.760
So I'm not so much on the doom and gloom page

32:59.760 --> 33:01.220
as everybody else is on with this.

33:01.220 --> 33:06.500
Although I do understand the argument that you know what, why don't parents just freakin'

33:06.500 --> 33:07.900
read the labels?

33:07.900 --> 33:15.460
I find it disgusting that we've had to come to this, that first of all there's not as

33:15.460 --> 33:19.900
much honesty I think in the marketing of some of these games.

33:19.900 --> 33:28.260
You know, I don't think that they're particularly hiding their content, you know, but I also

33:28.260 --> 33:34.340
don't think that they are 100% accurate about the level of some of the things that are in

33:34.340 --> 33:40.400
some of the games and are hiding behind the rating system to see what they can eek past.

33:40.400 --> 33:41.400
How movies do.

33:41.400 --> 33:42.400
Well, true.

33:42.400 --> 33:43.400
True.

33:43.400 --> 33:44.400
You know, but...

33:44.400 --> 33:47.520
I think there should be consistency between games and movies, though, and I've said that

33:47.520 --> 33:48.520
a long time ago.

33:48.520 --> 33:51.080
I think they should be using the same rating system.

33:51.080 --> 33:58.900
But I think that if a child, if it is proven that the actions of a child are based directly

33:58.900 --> 34:04.140
off of an event in a video game, their parents need to be held liable for neglect, for being

34:04.140 --> 34:07.020
negligent in what their children are doing.

34:07.020 --> 34:12.620
It is not the job of the government, nor is it the job of video game companies to decide

34:12.620 --> 34:14.660
what children play.

34:14.660 --> 34:19.900
It is the job of the parent to censor what their children look at.

34:19.900 --> 34:25.560
And where me myself, you know, I know when I have kids I'm going to, you know, I basically

34:25.560 --> 34:29.220
got to look at whatever I wanted to when I was younger.

34:29.220 --> 34:32.940
And I grew up fine and responsible because I grew up prepared for it.

34:32.940 --> 34:33.940
That's how I feel.

34:33.940 --> 34:36.460
I know that that's how I'm going to be with my children.

34:36.460 --> 34:41.080
If they do something bad as a result of a game, they don't get to play the game anymore.

34:41.080 --> 34:43.460
You know, I'm going to punish them when they do something wrong.

34:43.460 --> 34:49.020
I think, you know, in general, you know, because again, I'm preparing, I'm going to have a

34:49.020 --> 34:52.060
a kidlet in a year or so. Scary thought, huh?

34:52.060 --> 34:55.140
But, um, but I... Demon spawn!

34:55.140 --> 34:59.980
Just kidding. No gamer in training. But, um,

34:59.980 --> 35:05.280
I think that I feel very strongly that it's the job

35:05.280 --> 35:09.560
of the parent to ultimately decide if their child's gonna be allowed to have something and I

35:09.560 --> 35:11.940
think that if their child seems to be going behind their back

35:11.940 --> 35:16.620
and getting these games or trading with their friends, and parents need to say

35:16.620 --> 35:21.980
no you're gonna give me that we're taking it back they need to you know and

35:21.980 --> 35:25.640
I know kids are gonna hide stuff and try to get away with stuff you know I was

35:25.640 --> 35:29.540
that way when I was a kid I don't know what child didn't try to get something

35:29.540 --> 35:32.900
past their parents at some point another and parents please do not lie to me and

35:32.900 --> 35:35.820
say that your children are perfect angels because we know what kids are

35:35.820 --> 35:43.420
like we were all there you know no no child is going to be perfectly

35:43.420 --> 35:46.280
well-behaved and even if it looks like they're perfectly well-behaved you know

35:46.280 --> 35:48.280
Damn, well, they're trying something behind your back

35:48.680 --> 35:53.360
It's the nature of being a kid you have to go through your rebellious phase and then you grow out of it

35:54.080 --> 35:55.720
part of growing up

35:55.720 --> 35:57.720
but still I digress I

35:58.520 --> 36:00.520
really do think that it

36:01.040 --> 36:05.720
you know and I know that all not not all parents are like this not all of them are

36:07.160 --> 36:10.760
Really irresponsible, but I have met plenty who are I

36:10.760 --> 36:14.240
I have all the ones that you see on television

36:14.240 --> 36:17.400
who are like, my child...

36:17.400 --> 36:21.800
it's their fault. Go, seriously, go observe

36:21.800 --> 36:25.880
at a GameStop or an EB Games sometimes, just kinda lurk in the corner

36:25.880 --> 36:29.320
and kinda listen to some of the counter conversations between parents and kids

36:29.320 --> 36:32.480
it is amazing, it is amazing some of the stuff you would hear

36:32.480 --> 36:36.480
I mean is, oh my gosh, wow. I don't think

36:36.480 --> 36:38.480
enough parents take

36:38.520 --> 36:41.400
enough of an active role in their children's upbringing because they're

36:41.880 --> 36:45.280
And I understand being busy you're busy with I know right now

36:45.280 --> 36:49.760
I would not be in a position to have a child as long as I'm working full-time and going to school

36:49.760 --> 36:56.280
I am damn not having a child and I think there are too many, you know parents out there who are you know?

36:56.520 --> 37:00.880
Not dedicating the time they need to make sure that they're you know, children are

37:01.920 --> 37:05.320
Doing what they should be, you know playing game playing the right kind of game

37:05.320 --> 37:09.880
they're letting the game to babysit their children well I'm sure we're

37:09.880 --> 37:13.840
gonna get some emails on that so to go welcome them I really want to discuss it

37:13.840 --> 37:18.200
to go at orange lounge radio.com is the email Loki though what's your thought

37:18.200 --> 37:21.680
I'm gonna let my kids just they're only gonna be able to play Grand Theft Auto

37:21.680 --> 37:26.880
that is it you're doing like an experiment there's no experiment why do

37:26.880 --> 37:31.360
we need to do this anyways this is all Hillary Clinton's fault and you know why

37:31.360 --> 37:36.120
yes it is you know why because she wants some sort of platform so she can

37:36.120 --> 37:39.600
campaign for fucking president that's what it is and I can tell you this much

37:39.600 --> 37:45.200
we don't need that because why for one we don't have any sort of laws saying

37:45.200 --> 37:51.920
that I you know a child under 17 can't go see our rated movie it is these

37:51.920 --> 37:56.240
theaters policy there are no laws against that so why there have to be

37:56.240 --> 37:59.780
lost against the game I agree that if this is going to be against law then it

37:59.780 --> 38:04.100
should be against the law, the theater should be held responsible when a kid sneaks into

38:04.100 --> 38:07.020
an R-rated film, which is something we all did when we were kids.

38:07.020 --> 38:08.020
And besides, it's...

38:08.020 --> 38:09.020
Who snuck?

38:09.020 --> 38:10.020
I just went.

38:10.020 --> 38:12.920
It's gonna be just, you know, it's still gonna be the same problem.

38:12.920 --> 38:16.940
So what, you make it against the law for a kid to buy the game, okay, big deal.

38:16.940 --> 38:19.180
The parents are buying the games for the kids anyway, so what's the matter?

38:19.180 --> 38:21.180
I mean, you've solved nothing.

38:21.180 --> 38:22.180
Okay.

38:22.180 --> 38:23.180
Nothing?

38:23.180 --> 38:29.640
I honestly, though, have to say that I'm highly embarrassed to have Hillary Clinton as a representative

38:29.640 --> 38:36.520
of my gender well that's I don't I I don't think it's as bad as people are

38:36.520 --> 38:40.260
making it out to be I I think that I I kind of agree what you're saying it's

38:40.260 --> 38:44.200
kind of sad that it's come to this but I think that this bill is much better than

38:44.200 --> 38:50.880
bills in the past I think this I think there's if they have one then this one

38:50.880 --> 38:55.720
is more well thought out I think mm-hmm and so I can't say the Hillary Clinton

38:55.720 --> 39:01.720
because you know I think it's I think you I give her credit for saying okay we

39:01.720 --> 39:05.960
have this ESRB but the problem with it is it's regulated by the industry so

39:05.960 --> 39:08.680
let's have the government regulate it and then we could use this right I think

39:08.680 --> 39:13.320
it's it's the best idea but you know I'm sure I'll get an email or two on it

39:13.320 --> 39:16.240
whatever I'm sure and and have they have they solved the problems with you know

39:16.240 --> 39:20.280
pirates out there because no yeah oh that's right that's right they should

39:20.280 --> 39:26.280
just focus on that and not all right Jack Jack Sparrow's coming back haven't

39:26.280 --> 39:32.160
you seen the trailer yeah yeah I know I'm hilarious but seriously folks I would

39:32.160 --> 39:35.080
like I would like to receive the email I would love to hear from other parents

39:35.080 --> 39:39.160
especially just on a personal note since again like I said I'm planning on

39:39.160 --> 39:42.200
spawning soon well the last time this topic got brought up we did get some

39:42.200 --> 39:46.680
parents so and I welcome them because trust me I believe I love hearing the

39:46.680 --> 39:51.780
other side and I agreed with many of the emails that I received I do think that

39:51.780 --> 39:56.200
yes there's a there is a very high degree of responsibility with the

39:56.200 --> 40:00.480
companies for what they market but I do I strongly believe still that the

40:00.480 --> 40:04.120
ultimate power is in the hands of the parents and I I assure you this I will

40:04.120 --> 40:08.120
be emailing Senator Clinton and Senator Minn Lieberman's office trying to get an

40:08.120 --> 40:12.640
interview and it probably won't happen but I will email and try and allow them

40:12.640 --> 40:15.560
to present their perspective on the show if they so choose and I'd like to voice

40:15.560 --> 40:19.480
my opinion to the industry, we need more games with TNA, because there's a lot more violent

40:19.480 --> 40:21.200
games out there, not enough nudie.

40:21.200 --> 40:22.200
Alright.

40:22.200 --> 40:25.460
Well, you know, maybe having a bunch of, like, you know, nudie games will be like stress

40:25.460 --> 40:27.680
relief instead of incite violence.

40:27.680 --> 40:31.480
Alright, well, here's something, here's an interesting footnote now to all of this we've

40:31.480 --> 40:32.480
been talking about.

40:32.480 --> 40:38.040
Illinois passed one of these gaming laws not that long ago, overturned.

40:38.040 --> 40:42.840
It was supposed to go into effect January 1st of 2006, however, a district judge ruled

40:42.840 --> 40:45.300
that it would violate First Amendment.

40:45.300 --> 40:47.340
And so the bill was stricken.

40:47.340 --> 40:48.340
Interesting.

40:48.340 --> 40:49.340
Wait.

40:49.340 --> 40:50.340
Amendment.

40:50.340 --> 40:51.340
Amendment.

40:51.340 --> 40:53.740
Yeah, those are those things that our government continuously ignores.

40:53.740 --> 40:54.740
Oh, that's right.

40:54.740 --> 40:55.740
Constitution.

40:55.740 --> 40:56.740
I remember the Constitution.

40:56.740 --> 41:00.660
We used to study that in elementary school, but now they just teach it because they're

41:00.660 --> 41:01.900
forced to.

41:01.900 --> 41:03.500
I thought this was interesting.

41:03.500 --> 41:04.540
I have to say this.

41:04.540 --> 41:06.020
You have to hear this, okay?

41:06.020 --> 41:09.180
This was a 53-page ruling by Judge Kennelly.

41:09.180 --> 41:15.140
He specifically talks about God of War and mentions a mini-game where the character Kratos

41:15.140 --> 41:17.920
has sexual relations with two women.

41:17.920 --> 41:24.140
Quote, Because of this one scene, a game such as God of War, which essentially parallels

41:24.140 --> 41:29.600
a classic book like The Odyssey, likely would be prohibited for minors under the SEVGL because

41:29.600 --> 41:34.840
the statute allows a game to be regulated based on one scene without regard to the value

41:34.840 --> 41:36.540
of the game as a whole.

41:36.540 --> 41:42.180
Such a sweeping regulation on speech, even sexually explicit speech, is unconstitutional

41:42.180 --> 41:46.540
even if aimed at protecting minors I love this man

41:46.540 --> 41:50.380
the game does not show him having sex

41:50.380 --> 41:53.600
very interesting at all you know what

41:53.600 --> 41:58.260
you know what you know what happens when when children grow up sheltered

41:58.260 --> 42:01.900
they are so unprepared for real life once they decide to

42:01.900 --> 42:05.300
live out there and so they live with mommy and daddy until they're 30 I have

42:05.300 --> 42:06.100
witnessed this

42:06.100 --> 42:10.460
it's scary do you want your children living with you until they're 30

42:10.460 --> 42:16.740
We're gonna get some e-mails, we're gonna get some e-mails, alright, cause whenever

42:16.740 --> 42:21.460
we bring up politics it's like whoosh, angry e-mails, not just any e-mails but angry e-mails.

42:21.460 --> 42:26.340
Honestly the people that I know personally who grew up very sheltered still live with

42:26.340 --> 42:27.340
their parents.

42:27.340 --> 42:31.900
Alright, let's get back into some other gaming news and let's talk about those violent video

42:31.900 --> 42:35.340
games as well as the G-rated ones coming out very soon.

42:35.340 --> 42:38.180
Loki, what kind of games can we expect coming out in the US?

42:38.180 --> 42:41.300
I know we're getting towards the end of the year, so not a lot, but what's coming out

42:41.300 --> 42:42.300
in the US?

42:42.300 --> 42:46.420
Not much, but it's really the only big things we've got coming out, especially this week,

42:46.420 --> 42:49.300
Animal Crossing and Final Fantasy.

42:49.300 --> 42:55.560
Now if you're more of a fan of the portable stuff, you've got a lot of stuff for the PSP.

42:55.560 --> 43:04.160
For example, Smackdown vs. Raw 06 is coming out finally for the PSP, which is good.

43:04.160 --> 43:07.440
Other than that, December is a very dead month for games.

43:07.440 --> 43:10.920
The biggest game probably coming out this month is going to be Gauntlet Seven Sorrows

43:10.920 --> 43:14.320
for the PlayStation 2 and Xbox.

43:14.320 --> 43:15.960
But a lot of everything else has moved away.

43:15.960 --> 43:19.000
Of course Dead Alive 4 coming out for the 360 on the 15th.

43:19.000 --> 43:21.040
I heard that got pushed back again though.

43:21.040 --> 43:22.040
No that's got...

43:22.040 --> 43:23.040
Or is that the 15th?

43:23.040 --> 43:25.540
It was pushed to the 6th and then it got pushed back to the 15th.

43:25.540 --> 43:29.700
So the 15th hopefully.

43:29.700 --> 43:33.160
But January there's going to be a little bit more coming hopefully.

43:33.160 --> 43:39.120
We've got, what was it, 25 The Life being the big one, the next cop killer game that'll

43:39.120 --> 43:43.840
be coming out, that'll be getting the press I'm sure.

43:43.840 --> 43:47.840
Then we have Painkiller Hell Wars coming out on the Xbox, which is going to be a pretty

43:47.840 --> 43:49.680
cool game.

43:49.680 --> 43:55.080
True Swing Golf for the Nintendo DS, which should be a pretty solid game from what I

43:55.080 --> 43:56.080
hear.

43:56.080 --> 44:03.120
And of course, Ape Escape 3, and Ape Escape Academy for the PSP.

44:03.120 --> 44:06.600
Useless. Useless. Yeah.

44:06.600 --> 44:10.360
Alright, Jamie, Jamie, how about UK?

44:10.360 --> 44:13.520
Coming out all on the 9th, Battalion Wars

44:13.520 --> 44:18.760
for the GameCube, Burnout Legends for the DS.

44:18.760 --> 44:24.800
On the PSP we have Championship Manager PSP, Madden NFL 2006, Namco Museum

44:24.800 --> 44:29.240
Battle Collection, DS and PSP. We also have King Kong.

44:29.240 --> 44:32.600
On the Xbox and GameCube, Chronicles of Narnia.

44:32.600 --> 44:38.600
We have WWE Smackdown vs. Raw 2006 for the PSP and The Sims 2

44:38.600 --> 44:41.600
and King Kong on the Game Boy Advance.

44:41.600 --> 44:46.600
Actually, and I do apologize because The Sims 2 and King Kong are coming out on the 16th and 17th.

44:46.600 --> 44:52.600
But I find it incredibly hilarious that the UK is getting a release of America's Army Rise of the Soldier.

44:52.600 --> 44:54.600
You know, it's a very popular game over here.

44:54.600 --> 44:57.600
It's kind of got that little underground following that we don't talk about much,

44:57.600 --> 45:00.600
but I've run into a lot of people that are really into this game.

45:00.600 --> 45:07.360
Well, it is supposed to be a fairly accurate representation, but I just, I don't know why

45:07.360 --> 45:10.040
I find it funny that it's being released overseas.

45:10.040 --> 45:16.720
Um, Loki, you got a story about something going on with the Madden series, or Madden

45:16.720 --> 45:17.720
in general?

45:17.720 --> 45:18.720
What's up?

45:18.720 --> 45:22.800
Well Madden's EA is getting sued over Madden NFL 2006, um, because of this feature that

45:22.800 --> 45:31.040
they have this superstar mode basically you start off by picking your parents

45:31.040 --> 45:35.880
kind of your lineage and based on that it will calculate what kind of a player

45:35.880 --> 45:40.760
you would have become and then you start off you know basically from that however

45:40.760 --> 45:51.680
this is kind of funny because there was a game called was it a see here heart of

45:51.680 --> 45:59.860
a champion and it's actually a game that this guy opposed to EA about where players would

45:59.860 --> 46:05.960
take a high school athlete and go from you know through college and stuff and into the

46:05.960 --> 46:11.360
pros and basically play all the way through from you know high school all the way to professional

46:11.360 --> 46:12.360
and

46:12.360 --> 46:15.080
isn't there something exactly like this in the basketball one too

46:15.080 --> 46:19.600
yeah something like that but see and this was an idea he posed to them and basically

46:19.600 --> 46:24.580
they ripped it off so three years later you also do the same thing in Derby

46:24.580 --> 46:30.420
Owners Club with horses well kind of but a little different yeah breed your own

46:30.420 --> 46:34.360
human all right interesting well we'll see what happens with that that'll be a

46:34.360 --> 46:37.540
fun court battle or more likely out of court settlement we'll see what happens

46:37.540 --> 46:42.500
that Dark Sakura is here to remind us that there is a big world out there

46:42.500 --> 46:46.780
outside of gaming you know because if all you did all day long was stay inside

46:46.780 --> 46:49.900
and play video games you would have no time to go out and corrupt the youth of

46:49.900 --> 46:56.320
America so dark soccer she's gave me a face I got a face no that's a knowing

46:56.320 --> 47:00.720
smile all right dark soccer is here to give us her advice column because

47:00.720 --> 47:04.360
there's a whole world outside go live in it dark soccer what are you gonna tell

47:04.360 --> 47:08.680
the kids about today today's bit of advice is how to evade a stampede of

47:08.680 --> 47:14.720
Shoppers know that this is good. This is very timely. I like this. Yeah

47:15.440 --> 47:16.620
number one

47:16.620 --> 47:24.220
React immediately stay focused and visualize your goal reacting early and decisively in crowds affords you your best shot at survival

47:24.580 --> 47:31.300
To do not join the herd if you cannot shop. No, you cannot shop if you cannot see the merchandise

47:31.300 --> 47:39.660
3. Do not move toward the herd. You risk being trampled if you try to thread your way through

47:39.660 --> 47:44.780
a stampede. If you are unable to get out of the way, bring your arms in tightly around

47:44.780 --> 47:48.980
any packages you are carrying, turn your body in the direction of the crowd, and let yourself

47:48.980 --> 47:52.620
be carried along as you work your way to the outside.

47:52.620 --> 47:57.540
4. Maximize your movement options. If you need to negotiate your way through a crowd,

47:57.540 --> 48:02.380
on the edge. Most shoppers will leave at least a few feet between themselves and surrounding

48:02.380 --> 48:08.260
walls so you will have room to maneuver. But my final bit of advice, just avoid the mall.

48:08.260 --> 48:12.060
You don't need to tickle me on the wall or whatever it is this year. Seriously, I went

48:12.060 --> 48:16.600
to the mall today. You went to the mall. I know, I went to the mall. I spent half my

48:16.600 --> 48:23.120
time looking for a parking space. That's it. Interesting. Amazingly enough, last year I

48:23.120 --> 48:28.700
actually had a pretty easy time parking because I have mad parking lots oh no no

48:28.700 --> 48:32.960
I I even did the trick at the local mall what you do is you drive up the parking

48:32.960 --> 48:36.360
structure to the very very top because there's a secret entrance to the mall

48:36.360 --> 48:40.360
that I thought nobody knew about but oh my god completely full the parking lot

48:40.360 --> 48:45.600
at the top completely full I follow people who leave you know what you

48:45.600 --> 48:50.840
supposed to do in the city and stuff I stalk whatever all right anyway a couple

48:50.840 --> 48:57.100
quick quick last few items for you guys sorry guys I'm having mic problems again

48:57.100 --> 49:01.420
a couple quick stories for you guys and we'll go over to Loki um I think this is

49:01.420 --> 49:05.380
interesting there's the Star Trek MMO that's coming out very soon well there

49:05.380 --> 49:12.700
was a study done which was quizzing 600 gamers who are interested in both Star

49:12.700 --> 49:18.340
Trek and MMORPGs divided them into three subgroups based on their interest blah

49:18.340 --> 49:23.580
blah blah blah blah the result 69% of MMO players were interested in Star Trek

49:23.580 --> 49:30.300
Online and 59% of Star Trek enthusiasts wanted to play the game however only 31%

49:30.300 --> 49:36.340
of regular PC gamers were eager to jump on to Star Trek Online I gotta say I'm

49:36.340 --> 49:39.860
curious I think there's a lot of interesting ideas they could do with a

49:39.860 --> 49:43.340
Star Trek game I wouldn't call myself a Trekkie but I think it could make a

49:43.340 --> 49:46.980
decent game I want to play a cue

49:47.380 --> 49:51.820
interesting I that was done by the way I Nielsen research and perpetual

49:51.820 --> 49:56.620
entertainment who are developing the upcoming PC MMO one of the quick story

49:56.620 --> 50:00.180
for you guys Halo the movie has a rumored director attached rumored

50:00.180 --> 50:04.420
rumored and I'm gonna pronounce this name name hit easily wrong I'm sorry

50:04.420 --> 50:09.140
Guillermo Guillermo I don't know Guillermo del Toro who directed Hellboy

50:09.140 --> 50:13.180
is rumored to be the person that they are courting to get to do the Halo movie

50:13.180 --> 50:19.020
movie. I think most people would just rather see Peter Jackson do it himself, but who knows

50:19.020 --> 50:24.540
after you guys see King Kong you might feel differently, I don't know. We'll see. Uh,

50:24.540 --> 50:28.220
Loki what else do you got there? Didn't Peter Jackson also do Dead Alive? He also did Meet

50:28.220 --> 50:33.720
the Feebles, let's not forget. Any last stories you got Loki? Some real quick stuff. The new

50:33.720 --> 50:38.960
Grand Theft Auto mod has just hit the internet. It's actually, it's kind of a trainer for

50:38.960 --> 50:42.540
Grand Theft Auto Liberty City Stories. It's a save game where you load it up and you can

50:42.540 --> 50:46.260
actually do different cheats in there including now they've added super jump, the ability

50:46.260 --> 50:49.740
to walk through walls and among other things.

50:49.740 --> 50:51.420
Really fun, I've actually played with this.

50:51.420 --> 50:55.280
It's kind of cool to be able to load it up and play around with that stuff.

50:55.280 --> 50:57.060
So that's really neat.

50:57.060 --> 51:00.700
Also coming to the arcade if you're a fan of first person shooters on the PC this should

51:00.700 --> 51:01.860
get you going.

51:01.860 --> 51:03.760
It's Half Life 2 Survivor.

51:03.760 --> 51:07.180
It's actually a first person shooter for the arcade.

51:07.180 --> 51:10.380
It's going to have a card system to be able to save your progress.

51:10.380 --> 51:14.660
the controls kind of look like a driving cabinet. You have two controllers, one for looking,

51:14.660 --> 51:17.980
one for aiming, and then foot pedals for jumping and crouching.

51:17.980 --> 51:23.100
So the grid, but way better. Yeah, way better. So that's kind of a really

51:23.100 --> 51:26.180
cool game. I thought the grid was your favorite game.

51:26.180 --> 51:30.720
No. There's been also another kind of marketing

51:30.720 --> 51:37.340
campaign going on for the PSP, one featuring dust bunnies and a squirrel. And it's really

51:37.340 --> 51:42.620
strange they describe the PSP as like a nut you can play with outside.

51:42.620 --> 51:52.800
What's very interesting though, and this is actually, they've got these weird squirrely

51:52.800 --> 51:56.660
things in the eyes that kind of look stoned which also matches this new campaign that's

51:56.660 --> 52:04.920
going on, kind of a graffiti campaign, which you see kids basically hypnotized by the PSP.

52:04.920 --> 52:11.060
Now most people aren't liking this and they're actually tagging over it and writing very

52:11.060 --> 52:16.740
colorful things like, I'll ride a Brompton bicycle or I'll teabag a mime before I give

52:16.740 --> 52:18.740
Sony Corp another fucking dime.

52:18.740 --> 52:21.500
That was poetic, that's nice.

52:21.500 --> 52:23.260
Yes, and a lot of people...

52:23.260 --> 52:27.540
I like the part about the mime, because there's not enough mime violence in the world.

52:27.540 --> 52:31.460
Not enough mime violence, but it's basically popping up everywhere, they've actually caught

52:31.460 --> 52:36.340
some of the artists responsible for it, you know, pictures of them.

52:36.340 --> 52:41.340
So another campaign that's not really welcome.

52:41.340 --> 52:47.420
And finally in news of people paying way too much for a 360, someone's actually modded

52:47.420 --> 52:48.420
a 360.

52:48.420 --> 52:50.740
This was on llama.com and it's pretty cool.

52:50.740 --> 52:55.200
It's got a window on the side of it plus, you know, the wonderful cold cathode lights

52:55.200 --> 52:57.520
and glows blue and stuff.

52:57.520 --> 53:04.440
Right now with five days left to go, actually almost six days, it's going for $6,200 with

53:04.440 --> 53:07.280
71 bids.

53:07.280 --> 53:10.640
I hope you enjoy that 360 for what you paid for.

53:10.640 --> 53:13.400
They have so voided that warranty.

53:13.400 --> 53:15.480
Yes, and that is it.

53:15.480 --> 53:19.860
Alright, I have one last story for you guys.

53:19.860 --> 53:23.000
This is kind of one of those odd damn things.

53:23.000 --> 53:26.560
Maybe you heard about this game, it was up and running a while back, it was available

53:26.560 --> 53:32.940
at a shot of orange juice calm it was risk but using Google Maps to do it is

53:32.940 --> 53:38.500
playing risk on Google Maps well if you wanted to check out this game sorry too

53:38.500 --> 53:44.020
bad it's done it got cease and desisted by Hasbro who owns the right to risk and

53:44.020 --> 53:49.180
did you know put out their own versions of risk in 96 and 2000 I believe the

53:49.180 --> 53:52.960
goodbye message said nevertheless Hasbro none too happy that somebody is

53:52.960 --> 53:57.220
infringing on their trademark my suggestion to the author's rename it

53:57.220 --> 54:04.480
world conquest and make it similar but not the same yeah whatever make it

54:04.480 --> 54:11.240
nobody can take Russia or you know do your Google Maps let you go anywhere so

54:11.240 --> 54:16.920
you could do like you know Canadian conquest just choose Canada or you could

54:16.920 --> 54:25.260
do LA conquest just zoom in on LA forget it I know a conquest what Iowa

54:25.260 --> 54:32.640
