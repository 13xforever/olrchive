00:10:40,927 --> 00:10:41,828
[SPEAKER_18]: She's actually not here.

55
00:10:41,968 --> 00:10:48,049
[SPEAKER_18]: She's on her way, but she wasn't in an accident, but she was like, saw one or something.

56
00:10:48,269 --> 00:10:49,590
[SPEAKER_18]: We've replaced her with a ferret.

57
00:10:49,790 --> 00:10:51,010

59
00:10:53,991 --> 00:10:55,232
[SPEAKER_18]: We don't know how late.

60
00:10:55,573 --> 00:10:56,574
[SPEAKER_18]: I think only a few minutes.

61
00:10:56,814 --> 00:10:58,876
[SPEAKER_18]: Because she called in a timely manner, so we'll see.

62
00:10:59,477 --> 00:11:02,019
[SPEAKER_18]: But of course, over there, the one and only Interrupting Loki.

63
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:02,780
[SPEAKER_18]: Hello.

64
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:04,041
[SPEAKER_18]: How are you doing, my friend?

65
00:11:05,303 --> 00:11:10,908
[SPEAKER_15]: Good so far, but I just ate burgers from McDonald's, so... That could change, like the weather.

66
00:11:10,928 --> 00:11:12,670
[SPEAKER_18]: That could change your mood at a moment's notice.

67
00:11:13,551 --> 00:11:13,831
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.

68
00:11:14,412 --> 00:11:15,193
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, we'll see what happens.

69
00:11:17,165 --> 00:11:19,086
[SPEAKER_18]: We may have some special guests tonight, I don't know.

70
00:11:19,126 --> 00:11:25,909
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm sure Xtafer will want to do a movie review at some point tonight because we did see Jesus is Magic, an appropriate selection for the holiday season.

71
00:11:26,429 --> 00:11:30,211
[SPEAKER_18]: And John's out there too watching the week-old Survivor finale.

72
00:11:31,171 --> 00:11:33,412
[SPEAKER_18]: And then Bugged is out there too playing on the computer.

73
00:11:33,553 --> 00:11:36,494
[SPEAKER_18]: So we'll see if we can get any of them in here during some of tonight's show.

74
00:11:36,514 --> 00:11:38,175
[SPEAKER_18]: I didn't realize Survivor's still on.

75
00:11:38,875 --> 00:11:40,536
[SPEAKER_18]: Believe it or not, they're going to do another one.

76
00:11:40,556 --> 00:11:43,577
[SPEAKER_18]: There's another one taping right now and they've got applications for the next one.

77
00:11:43,817 --> 00:11:45,378
[SPEAKER_18]: You know, my friends say I should be on Survivor.

78
00:11:46,567 --> 00:11:47,408
[SPEAKER_18]: DarkSakura

00:12:04,144 --> 00:12:05,325

81
00:12:07,447 --> 00:12:08,948
[SPEAKER_18]: You know, a little Ultramix 3.

82
00:12:09,589 --> 00:12:13,272
[SPEAKER_18]: They keep giving free shit away on Ultramix 3, so I want to talk about Ultramix 3.

83
00:12:13,573 --> 00:12:14,874
[SPEAKER_18]: And some other gaming stuff as well.

84
00:12:14,894 --> 00:12:16,095
[SPEAKER_18]: I want to hear more about the Xbox 360.

85
00:12:19,182 --> 00:12:20,724
[SPEAKER_18]: I heard something kind of funny happen.

86
00:12:21,444 --> 00:12:21,784
[SPEAKER_18]: Today?

87
00:12:22,225 --> 00:12:22,525
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah.

88
00:12:23,966 --> 00:12:26,048
[SPEAKER_18]: Had some people camped out overnight.

89
00:12:26,068 --> 00:12:26,749
[SPEAKER_18]: Surprise!

90
00:12:27,850 --> 00:12:28,730
[SPEAKER_18]: We don't have anything.

91
00:12:28,750 --> 00:12:29,491
[SPEAKER_18]: Merry Christmas!

92
00:12:30,232 --> 00:12:31,153
[SPEAKER_18]: The internet sucks!

93
00:12:32,794 --> 00:12:34,956
[SPEAKER_18]: So I want to talk about that and have a few good laughs.

94
00:12:35,156 --> 00:12:40,461
[SPEAKER_18]: See, I'm even, for the occasion, I'm wrapped up in a blanket here, and I've got a bottle of vodka in my hand.

95
00:12:40,741 --> 00:12:41,802
[SPEAKER_18]: And today...

96
00:12:42,591 --> 00:12:46,894
[SPEAKER_18]: We will be opening the gate to OLR Town, my town.

97
00:12:47,114 --> 00:12:47,274

[SPEAKER_18]: So, um, everybody that has Animal Crossing can come join.

103
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:58,822
[SPEAKER_18]: Every time I play, I open the gates, but no one ever comes in.

104
00:12:59,342 --> 00:13:01,084
[SPEAKER_18]: I have to talk about Animal Crossing when we come back.

105
00:13:01,344 --> 00:13:02,725
[SPEAKER_18]: We'll talk about all that stuff when we come back.

[SPEAKER_04]: What the hell?

153
00:21:14,807 --> 00:21:16,208
[SPEAKER_00]: Orange Lounge Radio.

154
00:21:16,408 --> 00:21:18,590
[SPEAKER_00]: Broke Down Ghetto Bomani Radio.

155
00:21:18,670 --> 00:21:18,990
[SPEAKER_00]: What the?

156
00:21:21,053 --> 00:21:25,476
[SPEAKER_18]: and in that commercial you heard the lovely voice of DarkSakura there, who's not here yet, but she's on her way.

157
00:21:25,996 --> 00:21:27,137
[SPEAKER_18]: Now I'm getting a little concerned.

158
00:21:27,217 --> 00:21:28,918
[SPEAKER_18]: She probably usually would be here by now.

159
00:21:28,938 --> 00:21:30,138
[SPEAKER_18]: I hope everything's going okay.

160
00:21:30,699 --> 00:21:35,401
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm sure we'll get the full story as soon as she arrives, but as promised, I'm wrapped up in a blanket.

161
00:21:35,521 --> 00:21:38,023
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm celebrating the holidays the best, the only way I know how.

162
00:21:38,263 --> 00:21:41,285
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm wrapped up in a blanket, and I have a nice bottle of Guinness.

163
00:21:41,405 --> 00:21:43,506
[SPEAKER_18]: Actually, I decided against vodka.

164
00:21:43,526 --> 00:21:44,267
[SPEAKER_18]: I went for the Guinness.

165
00:21:44,347 --> 00:21:45,847
[SPEAKER_18]: So I have a nice bottle of Guinness in one hand here.

166
00:21:47,528 --> 00:21:49,810
[SPEAKER_18]: And I'm just thinking about some Yuletide greetings.

167
00:21:51,991 --> 00:21:53,633
[SPEAKER_18]: which I'm sure I'll be rambling off a little later.

168
00:21:54,734 --> 00:21:56,537
[SPEAKER_18]: Loki, how's OLR Town going over there?

169
00:21:57,523 --> 00:22:00,025
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, our one and only guest has just left.

170
00:22:01,646 --> 00:22:03,208
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh, how nice.

171
00:22:04,008 --> 00:22:05,890
[SPEAKER_18]: Glad to see things are swinging in OLR Town.

172
00:22:06,130 --> 00:22:19,461
[SPEAKER_18]: You know, you may have to, as you add more friend codes, and don't forget, guys, if you want to get into OLR Town, head on over to our chat room at www.orangeonestrater.com, click on chat, and send Loki a private message with your friend code.

173
00:22:19,501 --> 00:22:20,762
[SPEAKER_15]: I have a lot of them already.

174
00:22:20,802 --> 00:22:25,546
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, I have to look and see who's in here, but I have a lot of people already added.

175
00:22:26,027 --> 00:22:28,668
[SPEAKER_15]: That were posting in, like, forums and stuff.

176
00:22:28,749 --> 00:22:29,049
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh, good.

177
00:22:29,389 --> 00:22:30,930
[SPEAKER_15]: So, let's see who we got here.

178
00:22:30,950 --> 00:22:32,330
[SPEAKER_18]: Nah, I'll just, we'll just take your word for it.

179
00:22:32,350 --> 00:22:33,331
[SPEAKER_18]: You don't have to name them all off.

180
00:22:33,371 --> 00:22:34,031
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.

181
00:22:34,111 --> 00:22:41,075
[SPEAKER_18]: If they message you and, you know, want to know if they're on the list, you can tell them if they're there or not or get them out of... Now, are you close to maxing out your list just yet?

182
00:22:41,135 --> 00:22:42,896
[SPEAKER_18]: Have you maxed out the list there on Animal Crossing?

183
00:22:43,256 --> 00:22:43,477
[SPEAKER_15]: No.

184
00:22:43,737 --> 00:22:45,978
[SPEAKER_15]: I've only got about seven people.

185
00:22:47,321 --> 00:22:53,944
[SPEAKER_15]: I have Dan, I have Milty, Black Lab, Jason, Harold, you, and Jamie.

186
00:22:54,204 --> 00:23:01,927
[SPEAKER_18]: You know, I haven't touched Animal Crossing in probably about five days now, which is kind of sad, because I was all into Animal Crossing.

187
00:23:02,167 --> 00:23:15,232
[SPEAKER_18]: Like, I was so up and ready to play Animal Crossing, and I was digging all around town trying to find a copy of Animal Crossing, and I went everywhere I could, and trying to get a copy of Animal Crossing, and...

188
00:23:17,287 --> 00:23:17,707
[SPEAKER_18]: DarkSakura is here!

189
00:23:37,097 --> 00:23:39,398
[SPEAKER_04]: Mother Nature can bite my abundant ass.

190
00:23:40,298 --> 00:23:41,139
[SPEAKER_18]: Your abundant ass?

191
00:23:41,159 --> 00:23:41,659
[SPEAKER_18]: What happened here?

192
00:23:42,039 --> 00:23:42,719
[SPEAKER_18]: You want a sip, honey?

193
00:23:43,239 --> 00:23:43,900
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay, alright.

194
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:45,600
[SPEAKER_18]: Alright, anyway.

195
00:23:46,341 --> 00:23:50,902
[SPEAKER_18]: We'll talk about our week and day is usually how we start off the show.

196
00:23:50,922 --> 00:23:54,324
[SPEAKER_18]: Since DarkSakura is getting situated, we'll go over to Loki and see.

197
00:23:54,444 --> 00:23:55,164
[SPEAKER_18]: Loki, how was your week?

198
00:23:55,184 --> 00:23:55,624
[SPEAKER_18]: How was your day?

199
00:23:56,805 --> 00:23:59,426
[SPEAKER_15]: My week and day, pretty uneventful.

200
00:24:00,886 --> 00:24:02,147
[SPEAKER_15]: Just still been fighting the cold.

201
00:24:03,349 --> 00:24:06,290
[SPEAKER_15]: This week we actually found out though that we're going to get a lot of time off.

202
00:24:08,311 --> 00:24:13,454
[SPEAKER_15]: They're giving us the Friday and Monday, you know, around Christmas and New Year's.

203
00:24:13,534 --> 00:24:17,515
[SPEAKER_15]: So actually this next week I work four days and the week after I work three days.

204
00:24:19,056 --> 00:24:19,576
[SPEAKER_18]: So it rocks.

205
00:24:19,796 --> 00:24:20,597
[SPEAKER_18]: Must be nice.

206
00:24:21,077 --> 00:24:21,657
[SPEAKER_18]: Must be nice.

207
00:24:21,837 --> 00:24:24,659
[SPEAKER_18]: And a $250 gift card for cash.

208
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:30,781
[SPEAKER_15]: Other than that, I've just been playing a lot of Animal Crossing actually.

209
00:24:30,941 --> 00:24:32,022
[SPEAKER_15]: Not too much in the

210
00:24:32,674 --> 00:24:34,415
[SPEAKER_15]: Can you do friendly fire on Call of Duty 2?

211
00:25:03,687 --> 00:25:07,548
[SPEAKER_18]: Um, well, we played Deathmatch, so I suppose you could.

212
00:25:08,268 --> 00:25:19,511
[SPEAKER_18]: In the single-player mode, though, because I was watching Extifer play a demo on one of those Xbox 360 kiosks at, like, Circuit City or whatever, and I kept telling him, shoot that guy in the back of the head, shoot your friend in the back of the head, I want to see blood, I want to see blood.

213
00:25:19,951 --> 00:25:22,111
[SPEAKER_18]: And, like, he said he was trying to do it, but it wouldn't work.

214
00:25:22,191 --> 00:25:24,352
[SPEAKER_18]: But, you know, he might have just not been doing it right.

215
00:25:24,512 --> 00:25:29,033
[SPEAKER_15]: But I know that it's really fun, and I like the way that they do the maps where they don't show where each player is.

216
00:25:29,775 --> 00:25:35,722
[SPEAKER_15]: But when you fire your gun, a little blip goes on your screen showing you which direction the sound came in.

217
00:25:36,302 --> 00:25:37,103
[SPEAKER_15]: And that's really cool.

218
00:25:39,165 --> 00:25:47,695
[SPEAKER_15]: But other than that, I'm actually going to try to play some more games while... Let's see here.

219
00:25:50,536 --> 00:25:51,116
[SPEAKER_15]: Thanks for watching!

220
00:26:04,928 --> 00:26:05,689
[SPEAKER_17]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

221
00:26:34,136 --> 00:26:44,341
[SPEAKER_18]: What's actually going on is that Live 365 is doing rotating outages, and they've been doing them all weekend, and we think we've missed it for tonight, but we're not sure.

222
00:26:44,741 --> 00:26:51,764
[SPEAKER_18]: So if kids, at 8 o'clock, the station goes down, we ain't coming back tonight, because Live 365 is doing rotating outages.

223
00:26:51,824 --> 00:26:52,645
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't know what the hell they're doing.

224
00:26:52,665 --> 00:26:57,487
[SPEAKER_18]: They're moving their servers to a new thing, a bigger, better, stronger, faster, harder server.

225
00:26:57,567 --> 00:26:58,087
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't know what it is.

226
00:26:58,127 --> 00:26:59,188
[SPEAKER_04]: We need to move them to Sweden.

227
00:26:59,488 --> 00:27:06,873
[SPEAKER_18]: So whatever they're doing, they're moving their servers, and if we happen to be on one of the lucky servers that's getting moved tonight, we will be off the air at 8 o'clock.

228
00:27:07,193 --> 00:27:10,295
[SPEAKER_18]: So if the show goes down at 8 o'clock, we ain't coming back.

229
00:27:10,495 --> 00:27:11,076
[SPEAKER_18]: So sorry.

230
00:27:11,856 --> 00:27:15,739
[SPEAKER_18]: But hey, life sucks sometimes, and Christmas sucks when you've been bad.

231
00:27:16,439 --> 00:27:18,861
[SPEAKER_18]: So, anyway.

232
00:27:20,962 --> 00:27:22,363
[SPEAKER_18]: Where are we at show-wise?

233
00:27:22,383 --> 00:27:22,803
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm sorry.

234
00:27:23,344 --> 00:27:25,505
[SPEAKER_04]: Please do it with a mouthful of burrito.

235
00:27:25,685 --> 00:27:26,065
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh, okay.

236
00:27:26,686 --> 00:27:27,206
[SPEAKER_18]: How was your week?

237
00:27:27,226 --> 00:27:27,626
[SPEAKER_18]: How was your day?

238
00:27:27,847 --> 00:27:28,247
[SPEAKER_04]: Burrito.

239
00:27:28,267 --> 00:27:28,407
[SPEAKER_04]: Burrito.

240
00:27:29,124 --> 00:27:31,245
[SPEAKER_15]: Her week and day is going to get a lot better.

241
00:27:31,585 --> 00:27:33,366
[SPEAKER_15]: I've been trying to get this forever.

242
00:27:33,586 --> 00:27:34,967
[SPEAKER_15]: This was going to be a wedding gift.

243
00:27:35,127 --> 00:27:38,128
[SPEAKER_15]: Now it's actually a Christmas present.

244
00:27:38,508 --> 00:27:45,771
[SPEAKER_18]: I got the last one, the actual display model, but... Oh, right on.

245
00:27:45,932 --> 00:27:46,972
[SPEAKER_04]: I have football lacrosse.

246
00:27:47,012 --> 00:27:48,753
[SPEAKER_04]: That means Dan doesn't get to play the PSP anymore.

247
00:27:49,153 --> 00:27:50,153
[SPEAKER_18]: Did that actually come out?

248
00:27:50,334 --> 00:27:50,534
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes.

249
00:27:50,554 --> 00:27:50,794
[SPEAKER_18]: For real?

250
00:27:51,014 --> 00:27:53,315
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh, I want to see this thing you've been talking about.

251
00:27:54,181 --> 00:27:59,383
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm gonna have your present at the end of the week because I didn't go shopping last week as I had finals!

252
00:28:21,877 --> 00:28:22,398
[SPEAKER_18]: That's alright.

253
00:28:22,678 --> 00:28:23,839
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh, and this will be your week and your day.

254
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:25,601
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, finals kicked my ass.

255
00:28:25,701 --> 00:28:30,446
[SPEAKER_04]: However, I got feedback on my second to last illustrated project and I made a 95 on it.

256
00:28:31,367 --> 00:28:32,008
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I'm awesome.

257
00:28:33,247 --> 00:28:36,608
[SPEAKER_04]: He said that my Silent Hill cover looked really nice.

258
00:28:37,408 --> 00:28:38,449
[SPEAKER_04]: I haven't got my grade on it yet.

259
00:28:38,889 --> 00:28:44,510
[SPEAKER_04]: I got full points for my Dreamweaver project, and I haven't got the results back of my World Geography final.

260
00:28:44,730 --> 00:28:47,711
[SPEAKER_18]: Did you link the Silent Hill thingy-bobber in chat?

261
00:28:47,731 --> 00:28:48,951
[SPEAKER_18]: Because it was actually really good.

262
00:28:49,031 --> 00:28:52,933
[SPEAKER_18]: It's something that I could see actually being used on a PlayStation-type thing.

263
00:28:52,953 --> 00:28:57,954
[SPEAKER_04]: I linked it in my live journal, but I'll link it in the chat room when I'm done with my thing.

264
00:28:58,154 --> 00:29:02,059
[SPEAKER_18]: There's not everybody in chat stalks you, LJ wise, so you should probably link that.

265
00:29:02,079 --> 00:29:03,340
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I also am friends only.

266
00:29:05,458 --> 00:29:14,324
[SPEAKER_18]: I had to fight the rain tonight because it was just really nasty I was sick before I left home, really icky and then I had to pass an accident and then I had to go to Starbucks and get a latte

267
00:29:34,414 --> 00:29:35,975
[SPEAKER_04]: I picked up brownie bites for everybody.

268
00:29:36,055 --> 00:29:39,317
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh yeah, I wanted a brownie bite, but I had to pass because I was in mid-sentence earlier.

269
00:29:39,497 --> 00:29:40,058
[SPEAKER_18]: No, right on.

270
00:29:40,898 --> 00:29:42,359
[SPEAKER_04]: And, um... No?

271
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:43,760
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think they have nuts.

272
00:29:44,541 --> 00:29:45,421
[SPEAKER_15]: I didn't know what they were.

273
00:29:45,922 --> 00:29:48,243
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, I will have to eat one and see if they have nuts in them.

274
00:29:50,625 --> 00:29:51,766
[SPEAKER_18]: These are nut-free, my friend.

275
00:29:52,807 --> 00:29:54,328
[SPEAKER_04]: They are the nutless wonder.

276
00:29:55,849 --> 00:29:56,849
[SPEAKER_18]: Just like... Never mind.

277
00:29:58,650 --> 00:29:59,391
[SPEAKER_04]: A fitting meal.

278
00:30:01,993 --> 00:30:03,614
[SPEAKER_04]: But, um... Thank you.

279
00:30:05,239 --> 00:30:12,162
[SPEAKER_04]: I also got DJ KK last night, which is the KK Eurobeat song, while I was watching Stargate.

280
00:30:12,762 --> 00:30:17,024
[SPEAKER_18]: Now, actually, Loki has OLR Town open tonight for our listeners to join in.

281
00:30:17,044 --> 00:30:20,485
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, you have the little brat lost in your town, and I have the mama in my town.

282
00:30:20,565 --> 00:30:22,926
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes, I've been trying to get, yeah.

283
00:30:23,507 --> 00:30:27,108
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, so we'll have to fix that at some point tonight, reunite baby and mama.

284
00:30:27,308 --> 00:30:30,089
[SPEAKER_15]: I have to find the baby, because baby appears every now and then.

285
00:30:30,390 --> 00:30:33,651
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, well, I know where mama is, so I'll go to your town and rescue the baby.

286
00:30:35,197 --> 00:30:40,619
[SPEAKER_18]: I think DarkSakura put something trippy in these brownies because I'm feeling all warm and fuzzy.

287
00:30:40,639 --> 00:30:42,399
[SPEAKER_04]: That would be the stuff at Starbucks.

288
00:30:42,459 --> 00:30:43,340
[SPEAKER_18]: No, no, wait, that's the Guinness.

289
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:46,741
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I can't have that as I'm going to be driving tonight.

290
00:30:47,501 --> 00:30:50,842
[SPEAKER_04]: And I may have jury duty tomorrow, which I hope I do so I don't have to go to work.

291
00:30:51,482 --> 00:30:53,063
[SPEAKER_18]: Merry Christmas, you get jury duty.

292
00:30:53,163 --> 00:30:54,003
[SPEAKER_18]: How did that happen?

293
00:30:54,023 --> 00:30:58,444
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, because I missed it the last time and I called back to reschedule and I said, yeah, but I'm in school.

294
00:30:58,804 --> 00:31:01,345
[SPEAKER_04]: They're like, okay, well, we'll just schedule you for the week after finals.

295
00:31:02,265 --> 00:31:04,006
[SPEAKER_04]: And I hope I have it because I don't want to go to work.

296
00:31:04,967 --> 00:31:05,548
[SPEAKER_18]: I work for a bank!

297
00:31:05,568 --> 00:31:05,808
[SPEAKER_18]: Hallelujah!

298
00:31:27,623 --> 00:31:28,243
[SPEAKER_18]: Like murder?

299
00:31:28,403 --> 00:31:29,163
[SPEAKER_18]: Like double murder?

300
00:31:29,204 --> 00:31:32,645
[SPEAKER_04]: Not a double murder, but I'd like to get on like a suicide case.

301
00:31:34,927 --> 00:31:36,588
[SPEAKER_18]: How do suicide cases go to trial?

302
00:31:37,068 --> 00:31:38,789
[SPEAKER_04]: Because they have to prove it's a suicide for some.

303
00:31:39,489 --> 00:31:39,609
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh.

304
00:31:39,989 --> 00:31:41,050
[SPEAKER_18]: But with a jury trial?

305
00:31:42,191 --> 00:31:42,411
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah.

306
00:31:42,451 --> 00:31:44,232
[SPEAKER_18]: Did you mean to kill yourself, corpse?

307
00:31:44,672 --> 00:31:45,132
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, no.

308
00:31:45,973 --> 00:31:48,694
[SPEAKER_04]: There's just ones where they need to prove it's suicide or murder.

309
00:31:49,315 --> 00:31:53,737
[SPEAKER_04]: I like those kind, but I don't like just the straight up, hack you, RR, die.

310
00:31:54,597 --> 00:31:55,138
[SPEAKER_04]: RR, RR, RR.

311
00:31:56,465 --> 00:32:01,626
[SPEAKER_04]: But I want to get in on a case because I, you know, I should have been a lawyer except I'm too, you know, lazy.

312
00:32:02,466 --> 00:32:06,467
[SPEAKER_04]: But I wanted, I love studying the whole process.

313
00:32:06,607 --> 00:32:07,547
[SPEAKER_04]: I like seeing it in action.

314
00:32:07,567 --> 00:32:08,527
[SPEAKER_04]: I love watching court TV.

315
00:32:08,607 --> 00:32:13,488
[SPEAKER_18]: Are you going to get up there and if they ask you, now DarkSakura, well, of course, that's not what they'd say.

316
00:32:13,508 --> 00:32:16,229
[SPEAKER_18]: They'd say, Jamie, are you a supporter of the death penalty?

317
00:32:16,269 --> 00:32:18,790
[SPEAKER_18]: And you're going to get up there and say, I am the death penalty.

318
00:32:20,650 --> 00:32:21,950
[SPEAKER_04]: Goods don't kill people.

319
00:32:22,590 --> 00:32:23,010
[SPEAKER_04]: I do.

320
00:32:26,261 --> 00:32:27,523
[SPEAKER_04]: I support the NRA.

321
00:32:44,721 --> 00:32:45,221
[SPEAKER_18]: That's funny.

322
00:32:45,401 --> 00:32:46,561
[SPEAKER_02]: Inmate Battle Royale.

323
00:32:47,322 --> 00:32:48,802
[SPEAKER_02]: Took all them fuckers on an island.

324
00:32:49,182 --> 00:32:50,662
[SPEAKER_18]: That was a movie with Ray Liotta.

325
00:32:50,682 --> 00:32:51,062
[SPEAKER_18]: What was it?

326
00:32:51,103 --> 00:32:51,683
[SPEAKER_18]: No Escape?

327
00:32:52,043 --> 00:32:54,463
[SPEAKER_18]: And he gets off the island at the end, if I remember.

328
00:32:54,483 --> 00:32:55,424
[SPEAKER_18]: Sorry if this is a spoiler.

329
00:32:55,444 --> 00:32:57,504
[SPEAKER_18]: If I remember right, he gets off to the island at the end.

330
00:32:57,924 --> 00:33:02,005
[SPEAKER_18]: I think that... I don't know if I want... I don't know if I want Kuki living next door.

331
00:33:02,665 --> 00:33:04,886
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that it would solve a problem.

332
00:33:06,606 --> 00:33:10,387
[SPEAKER_04]: And then the inmate where they don't get their freedom, that they get a much nicer jail cell.

333
00:33:11,927 --> 00:33:13,588
[SPEAKER_04]: And then they have to defend their title the next year.

334
00:33:15,396 --> 00:33:17,858
[SPEAKER_15]: Someone snuck into my town and dropped fruit at my feet.

335
00:33:18,819 --> 00:33:21,321
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I'm not.

336
00:33:21,481 --> 00:33:28,927
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm thinking about overpopulation in the jail cells and cutting down costs.

337
00:33:29,087 --> 00:33:30,028
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm a penny saver.

338
00:33:30,208 --> 00:33:32,651
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm frugal.

339
00:33:32,911 --> 00:33:38,736
[SPEAKER_04]: They should vote for me because I would kill more people and save you more money.

340
00:33:39,246 --> 00:33:47,495
[SPEAKER_18]: You know, I just saw a meme on Life Journal, which is the order of the presidency or something like that, where you can add your name to the list to be in line to be president.

341
00:33:47,895 --> 00:33:49,937
[SPEAKER_18]: I'll have to give you a link so you can add your name.

342
00:33:49,977 --> 00:33:58,326
[SPEAKER_18]: I think they're on something like 5100, that if you could kill the other 5100 people, which isn't very many when you consider the population of the U.S., you, Ms.

343
00:33:58,346 --> 00:34:00,148
[SPEAKER_18]: DarkSakura, could be president of the U.S.

344
00:34:00,168 --> 00:34:00,649
[SPEAKER_04]: No, because I'm not 40.

345
00:34:03,123 --> 00:34:06,966
[SPEAKER_18]: Apparently they've thrown that out the door in this thing.

346
00:34:07,106 --> 00:34:08,087
[SPEAKER_18]: It's 35, but yes.

347
00:34:08,407 --> 00:34:09,948
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a few years off.

348
00:34:11,969 --> 00:34:13,450
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I did one other thing.

349
00:34:13,771 --> 00:34:23,097
[SPEAKER_04]: Because my friend was DJing at Rapture on Friday and ended up going out to the club, which I probably shouldn't have done in hindsight because I was shaking by the time we got back in my car.

350
00:34:23,597 --> 00:34:24,338
[SPEAKER_04]: I was so sick.

351
00:34:25,219 --> 00:34:25,399
[SPEAKER_04]: But...

352
00:34:27,944 --> 00:34:31,626
[SPEAKER_04]: The Purple Wind The Purple Wind

353
00:34:57,583 --> 00:35:12,906
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't have to be beautiful Anyway And the rest of my week has been recovering from the plague And you are on the other side of the plague now

354
00:35:13,806 --> 00:35:15,227
[SPEAKER_04]: Hopefully, but I don't know.

355
00:35:15,327 --> 00:35:19,970
[SPEAKER_04]: I took my double dose of Vicodin last night so that I would sleep through the night.

356
00:35:20,910 --> 00:35:24,472
[SPEAKER_04]: And I couldn't get to sleep with like two shots of my Vicodin syrup in me.

357
00:35:25,053 --> 00:35:28,135
[SPEAKER_04]: So I stayed up and finally I'm just like, shit, it's been three hours that I took it.

358
00:35:28,215 --> 00:35:31,617
[SPEAKER_04]: So I took another dose and then went and laid down at 4.30 and woke up at 3.00.

359
00:35:33,325 --> 00:35:37,406
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, I slept most of the day.

360
00:35:37,806 --> 00:35:38,807
[SPEAKER_18]: Let's see, my week and my day.

361
00:35:38,867 --> 00:35:41,668
[SPEAKER_18]: My week has been very busy.

362
00:35:42,748 --> 00:35:44,248
[SPEAKER_18]: I've just been kind of going out and doing a lot of things.

363
00:35:44,288 --> 00:35:45,129
[SPEAKER_18]: I went to the movies.

364
00:35:45,389 --> 00:35:56,592
[SPEAKER_18]: I went with Extifer and some friends to go see Sarah Silverman, Jesus is Magic, which is playing at our local art house movie, and of course Sarah Silverman's the comic that likes to say fuck a lot.

365
00:35:57,512 --> 00:35:58,133
[SPEAKER_18]: It was pretty funny.

366
00:35:59,053 --> 00:36:01,094
[SPEAKER_18]: I'll let Extifer talk about it more a little later in the show.

367
00:36:01,694 --> 00:36:01,834
[SPEAKER_18]: And

368
00:36:03,877 --> 00:36:05,698
[SPEAKER_18]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

369
00:36:22,562 --> 00:36:49,390
[SPEAKER_18]: from 14 years ago when I first played it is coming back to me and it's just that's all I care about right now so my village is going to be filled with weeds because it's going to have to wait until I beat Final Fantasy IV Advance and I'm making pretty good progress I'd say I'm about I don't know how far I'm into the game about five hours and how long was I game about 30 hours I'm about five hours into the game so as soon as I beat Final Fantasy IV Advance I'll be back into Animal Crossing again and then I'll join you guys in a while in our town um

370
00:36:50,523 --> 00:36:51,683
[SPEAKER_04]: Your town's going to be full of weeds.

371
00:36:51,743 --> 00:36:53,004
[SPEAKER_18]: I know it's going to be hella full of weeds.

372
00:36:53,064 --> 00:36:54,424
[SPEAKER_04]: Make sure you buy insurance.

373
00:36:55,145 --> 00:36:56,245
[SPEAKER_18]: I have insurance, thankfully.

374
00:36:56,425 --> 00:36:58,226
[SPEAKER_18]: I bought insurance from the dude when he came.

375
00:36:58,466 --> 00:37:00,526
[SPEAKER_18]: But I have yet to have a single KK song.

376
00:37:00,846 --> 00:37:02,647
[SPEAKER_18]: I've only paid off one loan on my house.

377
00:37:03,407 --> 00:37:04,368
[SPEAKER_18]: So, nothing there.

378
00:37:07,778 --> 00:37:16,863
[SPEAKER_18]: I was going to go to San Francisco yesterday, but the weather here has been kind of crappy here in California.

379
00:37:16,983 --> 00:37:25,448
[SPEAKER_18]: When it starts raining in California, people forget how to drive, and they're not sure what to do, especially when it starts raining hard and they start doing the flood watches.

380
00:37:25,488 --> 00:37:27,088
[SPEAKER_18]: People go crazy.

381
00:37:27,149 --> 00:37:28,089
[SPEAKER_18]: That's what's happening today.

382
00:37:29,190 --> 00:37:31,891
[SPEAKER_18]: So crazy, in fact, that we might go down mid-show tonight.

383
00:37:34,454 --> 00:37:34,854
[SPEAKER_18]: XBOX 360 XBOX 360 XBOX 360

384
00:38:04,594 --> 00:38:15,484
[SPEAKER_15]: The numbers for Best Buy leaked out to what they were going to get, and they were doing this Sunday sale that was advertised, and basically they were going to have the same allocations as they had when the thing launched.

385
00:38:16,885 --> 00:38:26,835
[SPEAKER_18]: So people were camping out, and basically the sources were said, do not pre-sell any of these, these are to be sold, do not open early, these are for the advertisement.

386
00:38:27,796 --> 00:38:28,136
[SPEAKER_18]: Well...

387
00:38:29,106 --> 00:38:31,769
[SPEAKER_18]: No, the Best Buy, of course, they didn't listen to that.

388
00:38:31,809 --> 00:38:35,792
[SPEAKER_18]: They pre-sold them some of the nights before and people camped out in the rain again for them.

389
00:38:36,473 --> 00:38:38,835
[SPEAKER_18]: And a lot of people were disappointed because, oh, guess what?

390
00:38:38,855 --> 00:38:41,558
[SPEAKER_15]: They sold them the night before and you waited for nothing.

391
00:38:41,618 --> 00:38:44,961
[SPEAKER_15]: But here, here's a nice compact laptop computer for cheap.

392
00:38:45,441 --> 00:38:46,462
[SPEAKER_15]: You want this instead?

393
00:38:46,502 --> 00:38:47,223
[SPEAKER_15]: You know, it's like...

394
00:38:47,919 --> 00:38:50,721
[SPEAKER_15]: So basically a nice bait and switch for a lot of the stores.

395
00:38:51,101 --> 00:39:02,709
[SPEAKER_18]: So now I heard that they just plain didn't get them because we were at a Best Buy here locally and I overheard a conversation about, yeah, all these people were camping out last night and I was like, oh, ha ha, they didn't get there.

396
00:39:02,729 --> 00:39:05,651
[SPEAKER_18]: That's the moment I knew, oh, ha ha, those Xbox 360s didn't show up.

397
00:39:05,931 --> 00:39:09,754
[SPEAKER_18]: Some kid on the internet played a practical joke on everybody, you know.

398
00:39:09,854 --> 00:39:12,456
[SPEAKER_18]: So they really did get more 360s, but they just didn't play something?

399
00:39:12,476 --> 00:39:13,676
[SPEAKER_15]: Supposedly they did.

400
00:39:13,736 --> 00:39:16,758
[SPEAKER_15]: They got a shipment in on Friday and they were supposed to hold them until the 18th.

401
00:39:17,759 --> 00:39:34,326
[SPEAKER_15]: Now the thing that was also funny though, and because this sold out so quick, and they did get them, there was rumors that they did get them, and people like, you know, waiting in line stuff, but this whole thing that they had pre-sold them, either the night before, just, you know, bad situation all over again.

402
00:39:35,707 --> 00:39:41,530
[SPEAKER_15]: However, if you didn't get them on this day, never fear, they're getting another shipment on the 22nd.

403
00:39:43,579 --> 00:39:45,120
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh, just before Christmas.

404
00:39:45,460 --> 00:39:45,721
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

405
00:39:45,881 --> 00:39:46,261
[SPEAKER_18]: You hope.

406
00:39:46,321 --> 00:39:48,743
[SPEAKER_18]: Now, is this coming from the same source?

407
00:39:49,264 --> 00:39:50,425
[SPEAKER_15]: This is from the same source.

408
00:39:50,505 --> 00:39:53,308
[SPEAKER_15]: And the source for this Best Buy stuff was an inside source.

409
00:39:53,348 --> 00:39:55,049
[SPEAKER_15]: And he's been the one that's providing.

410
00:39:55,069 --> 00:39:58,573
[SPEAKER_15]: I think he's the guy that provides Kotaku with all their information on Best Buy stuff.

411
00:39:58,893 --> 00:40:00,455
[SPEAKER_15]: It's all inside stuff.

412
00:40:01,916 --> 00:40:04,839
[SPEAKER_15]: So pretty much, yeah, the next shipment's the 22nd, supposedly.

413
00:40:05,285 --> 00:40:11,389
[SPEAKER_15]: It's nice that some stores are getting them, but I notice a lot of other stores, GameStop, are not getting their shipments in on time.

414
00:40:12,450 --> 00:40:14,311
[SPEAKER_18]: Just in time for Christmas, a third shipment to Best Buy.

415
00:40:14,331 --> 00:40:14,852
[SPEAKER_18]: That's hardly their fault.

416
00:40:15,232 --> 00:40:18,474
[SPEAKER_15]: I know, it's not their fault, but it's just because... Well, Microsoft's playing favorites.

417
00:40:18,775 --> 00:40:22,697
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, they're playing favorites with Best Buy, so... Must be nice.

418
00:40:23,658 --> 00:40:26,340
[SPEAKER_18]: Must be nice to be sucking the cock of Microsoft.

419
00:40:27,281 --> 00:40:30,203
[SPEAKER_18]: All I got to say is... Did you see Bill Gates and Melinda Gates?

420
00:40:30,643 --> 00:40:31,784
[SPEAKER_18]: And Bono from YouTube?

421
00:40:31,864 --> 00:40:33,785
[SPEAKER_18]: Persons of the Year for Time Magazine.

422
00:40:33,965 --> 00:40:34,245
[SPEAKER_15]: Nice.

423
00:40:34,265 --> 00:40:34,826
[SPEAKER_18]: Bill Gates...

424
00:40:36,595 --> 00:40:38,716
[SPEAKER_18]: Big fat mug right there on the cover of Time Magazine.

425
00:40:38,936 --> 00:40:40,076
[SPEAKER_18]: And nothing against Bill Gates.

426
00:40:40,116 --> 00:40:43,839
[SPEAKER_18]: I know he didn't single-handedly put out this Xbox 360 and cause a disaster.

427
00:40:44,159 --> 00:40:46,620
[SPEAKER_18]: But he sure makes a good target.

428
00:40:47,421 --> 00:40:50,602
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, but he is living proof that geeks can succeed.

429
00:40:50,862 --> 00:40:52,043
[SPEAKER_15]: And let me put it this way, though.

430
00:40:52,063 --> 00:40:55,865
[SPEAKER_15]: They really fucked up the whole launch of this system.

431
00:40:56,626 --> 00:40:57,186
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, it's...

432
00:40:58,163 --> 00:40:58,863
[SPEAKER_15]: All messed up.

433
00:40:59,184 --> 00:41:03,006
[SPEAKER_18]: What would you say to people though that say every launch is fucked up?

434
00:41:03,066 --> 00:41:08,489
[SPEAKER_15]: There are some pretty fucked up launches out there, but I say the way they've been treating this one, it's been really bad.

435
00:41:11,804 --> 00:41:12,365
[SPEAKER_15]: Really bad.

436
00:41:12,585 --> 00:41:15,007
[SPEAKER_18]: I mean... At least the 360s work, right?

437
00:41:15,027 --> 00:41:15,948
[SPEAKER_18]: They do.

438
00:41:15,968 --> 00:41:16,669
[SPEAKER_15]: They do work.

439
00:41:16,889 --> 00:41:20,772
[SPEAKER_15]: So, I mean, the whole thing of, you know, they're all defective and stuff.

440
00:41:20,952 --> 00:41:22,974
[SPEAKER_15]: Mine's... I've had mine crash once.

441
00:41:23,515 --> 00:41:24,596
[SPEAKER_15]: And it wasn't heat-related.

442
00:41:24,736 --> 00:41:27,418
[SPEAKER_15]: It's just a glitch in the game because of the crash.

443
00:41:27,999 --> 00:41:28,960
[SPEAKER_15]: Because games were rushed.

444
00:41:30,141 --> 00:41:31,062
[SPEAKER_15]: No, not necessarily.

445
00:41:31,102 --> 00:41:33,964
[SPEAKER_15]: Games will crash every now and then when you try to do weird things with them.

446
00:41:35,826 --> 00:41:37,367
[SPEAKER_15]: It just crashed for whatever reason.

447
00:41:37,507 --> 00:41:37,948
[SPEAKER_15]: But, um...

448
00:41:39,298 --> 00:41:43,040
[SPEAKER_15]: I haven't had it crashed since then, and I've been satisfied with mine.

449
00:41:43,060 --> 00:41:47,703
[SPEAKER_15]: It looks good on normal TVs and stuff, and you don't really need a high-def TV.

450
00:41:47,783 --> 00:41:57,229
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, you can, I mean, definitely you'll get the best picture out of it, but it's not going to suffer from having a normal TV, playing even four-player deathmatches and stuff.

451
00:41:58,029 --> 00:42:00,791
[SPEAKER_15]: Because it is higher-res, it's really nice.

452
00:42:01,351 --> 00:42:04,793
[SPEAKER_18]: When the screens split four ways, you can still see very well.

453
00:42:04,853 --> 00:42:05,654
[SPEAKER_18]: It's not like, you know...

454
00:42:06,491 --> 00:42:06,751
[SPEAKER_18]: and so on.

455
00:42:31,829 --> 00:42:32,009
[SPEAKER_18]: All right.

456
00:42:32,730 --> 00:42:34,812
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, kids, we are going to take a quick break.

457
00:42:35,553 --> 00:42:40,818
[SPEAKER_18]: Since we already did our winter-themed break there at the start of the show, we're going to just do some random stuff here.

458
00:42:41,318 --> 00:42:45,602
[SPEAKER_18]: And when we come back from this break, we'll get a check on what's going on in OLR Town.

459
00:42:45,662 --> 00:42:52,709
[SPEAKER_18]: I believe that DarkSakura is on her way to reunite Mom and Baby in OLR Town.

460
00:42:52,809 --> 00:42:53,850
[SPEAKER_18]: You're selling the baby?

461
00:42:54,070 --> 00:42:54,651
[SPEAKER_18]: What are you doing?

462
00:42:57,698 --> 00:43:02,559
[SPEAKER_18]: Tom Nook has offered 600 bells for the baby, so we'll see what happens.

463
00:43:02,759 --> 00:43:04,260
[SPEAKER_18]: Because Tom Nook would buy anything.

464
00:43:04,460 --> 00:43:06,060
[SPEAKER_04]: No, no, no, it's Crazy Red.

465
00:43:06,280 --> 00:43:08,521
[SPEAKER_04]: Because remember, we sell children on the black market.

466
00:43:08,601 --> 00:43:09,181
[SPEAKER_18]: No, that's right.

467
00:43:10,421 --> 00:43:10,881
[SPEAKER_18]: Crazy Red.

468
00:43:11,462 --> 00:43:12,402
[SPEAKER_18]: Alright, so we'll be back.

469
00:43:12,422 --> 00:43:14,402
[SPEAKER_18]: We're going to get a check on what's going on in Noel Our Town.

470
00:43:14,642 --> 00:43:16,763
[SPEAKER_18]: We'll talk about some stuff going on in the music game world.

471
00:43:17,243 --> 00:43:21,524
[SPEAKER_18]: And plenty more when we come back tonight here on Orange Lounge Radio.

472
00:44:16,501 --> 00:44:17,850
Thank you for watching!

473
00:45:10,876 --> 00:45:12,925
If you can't say goodbye

474
00:45:53,083 --> 00:45:54,792
Thanks for watching!

475
00:47:09,860 --> 00:47:30,308
[SPEAKER_09]: Stay with your eyes in the back of your head You never know if you'll be alive or be dead That is why, always have it You tell your midnight special Never leave, but without it Always better with a midnight special In the dark, always awake You never know, who you're gonna meet Come my friend, you got a midnight special

476
00:49:24,983 --> 00:49:25,964
[SPEAKER_18]: Gaming Radio.

477
00:49:26,184 --> 00:49:33,448
[SPEAKER_06]: So uncensored that even Tom Brokaw could get a job with us.

478
00:49:33,609 --> 00:49:34,969
[SPEAKER_06]: Orange Lounge Radio.

479
00:49:35,650 --> 00:49:39,592
[SPEAKER_18]: Welcome back boys and girls to Orange Lounge.

480
00:49:41,173 --> 00:49:44,816
[SPEAKER_18]: In that break you heard the Twilight Zone Midnight Special.

481
00:49:45,656 --> 00:49:46,697
[SPEAKER_18]: If you can say goodbye.

482
00:49:47,694 --> 00:49:51,436
[SPEAKER_18]: and the Rizlem remix, which people for no good reason were chatting about in our chat room.

483
00:49:51,816 --> 00:49:53,357
[SPEAKER_18]: So I thought I'd throw that in there.

484
00:49:53,377 --> 00:49:54,657
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, the Rizlem remix kind of sucks.

485
00:49:54,757 --> 00:49:57,058
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't know why people were talking about it, but they were.

486
00:49:57,098 --> 00:49:58,799
[SPEAKER_18]: The original Rizlem is so, so much better.

487
00:49:58,819 --> 00:50:02,581
[SPEAKER_18]: I mean, it's not that the Rizlem remix is awful, but it is.

488
00:50:03,922 --> 00:50:04,202
[SPEAKER_18]: It is.

489
00:50:05,142 --> 00:50:05,422
[SPEAKER_18]: Anyway.

490
00:50:07,363 --> 00:50:09,224
[SPEAKER_18]: Of course, you can join our chat room and get in on the fun.

491
00:50:09,364 --> 00:50:10,805
[SPEAKER_18]: www.orangeonstrater.com.

492
00:50:10,825 --> 00:50:11,365
[SPEAKER_18]: Click on chat.

493
00:50:11,685 --> 00:50:13,526
[SPEAKER_18]: Anything new going on in OLR town?

494
00:50:14,206 --> 00:50:14,507
[SPEAKER_18]: Nobody?

495
00:50:14,787 --> 00:50:15,167
[SPEAKER_18]: You know what?

496
00:50:16,798 --> 00:50:24,321
[SPEAKER_18]: Everybody fucking wanted to say, or was saying to us, oh, you gotta do the Animal Crossing thing and open up your town and we'll all visit.

497
00:50:24,341 --> 00:50:25,962
[SPEAKER_18]: Here we are, ghost town.

498
00:50:26,002 --> 00:50:28,563
[SPEAKER_18]: I think tumbleweed is rolling by in OLR town as we speak.

499
00:50:28,583 --> 00:50:32,765
[SPEAKER_15]: However, Wonder Dog Harold did leave me quite a bit of fruit at my feet.

500
00:50:32,805 --> 00:50:33,365
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, that's good.

501
00:50:34,286 --> 00:50:34,806
[SPEAKER_18]: Fruit is good.

502
00:50:34,866 --> 00:50:37,887
[SPEAKER_15]: Lots of peaches and pears, so I'm very thankful for that.

503
00:50:37,927 --> 00:50:38,307
[SPEAKER_15]: Good deal.

504
00:50:39,168 --> 00:50:43,990
[SPEAKER_15]: But yeah, I've got like what a few people added, but no one's visiting.

505
00:50:45,040 --> 00:50:47,422
[SPEAKER_18]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

506
00:51:07,329 --> 00:51:09,030
[SPEAKER_18]: 45 minutes until we get the plug pulled on this, kids.

507
00:51:09,250 --> 00:51:09,630
[SPEAKER_18]: We'll see.

508
00:51:09,890 --> 00:51:10,890
[SPEAKER_18]: Or at least we'll see what happens.

509
00:51:10,950 --> 00:51:11,290
[SPEAKER_18]: We don't know.

510
00:51:12,350 --> 00:51:15,091
[SPEAKER_18]: Anyway, we are going to open up the Skype line in a little bit.

511
00:51:15,451 --> 00:51:19,072
[SPEAKER_18]: I understand a brand new version of Skype actually just came out.

512
00:51:19,092 --> 00:51:19,752
[SPEAKER_18]: They're up to Skype 2.0.

513
00:51:20,532 --> 00:51:23,093
[SPEAKER_18]: We do not have that Skype version installed over here yet.

514
00:51:23,133 --> 00:51:26,053
[SPEAKER_18]: I guess Skype 2.0 adds webcam to it or something.

515
00:51:26,653 --> 00:51:29,554
[SPEAKER_18]: Of course, we at OLR, we threw away our webcam because it sucked.

516
00:51:30,154 --> 00:51:32,095
[SPEAKER_18]: Hopefully we'll have a new one eventually, but for now...

517
00:51:33,973 --> 00:51:34,294
[SPEAKER_18]: DarkSakura

518
00:51:48,499 --> 00:51:56,427
[SPEAKER_18]: All right, so we are going to open up the skyline a little bit, but I do want to talk a little bit about some Bomani news, some things going on out there in the world of the DDR.

519
00:51:57,127 --> 00:52:02,733
[SPEAKER_18]: First things first, there is going to be a soundtrack coming out for DDR Festival and DDR Strike.

520
00:52:03,153 --> 00:52:09,259
[SPEAKER_18]: It's kind of like a combined soundtrack, VWare, I don't really know what the hell they're calling it, but it's going to have a lot of the tracks from...

521
00:52:09,799 --> 00:52:11,021
[SPEAKER_18]: Festival and Strike Superstar

522
00:52:25,676 --> 00:52:27,057
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't think this song list is complete though.

523
00:52:27,077 --> 00:52:29,018
[SPEAKER_18]: I have a feeling there's going to be more to it.

524
00:52:29,078 --> 00:52:30,059
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't think this is it.

525
00:52:45,669 --> 00:52:46,249
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't know.

526
00:52:46,309 --> 00:52:46,650
[SPEAKER_18]: Very strange.

527
00:53:01,403 --> 00:53:02,784
[SPEAKER_18]: I actually wonder at all

528
00:53:30,681 --> 00:53:41,150
[SPEAKER_18]: If you're a hardcore DDR collector type person, then you'll want this soundtrack, otherwise it really doesn't do you a lot of good.

529
00:53:41,871 --> 00:53:43,652
[SPEAKER_18]: Because you can get the MP3s all over the internet.

530
00:53:44,653 --> 00:53:45,073
[SPEAKER_18]: Illegally.

531
00:53:46,849 --> 00:53:51,812
[SPEAKER_18]: I think this is kind of funny because have you visited the musicineverydirection.com website?

532
00:53:51,852 --> 00:53:56,475
[SPEAKER_18]: They have a brand new flash game that you can play on the musicineverydirection.com website.

533
00:53:56,975 --> 00:54:04,800
[SPEAKER_18]: And basically you go around and you collect these little icons, but you try to avoid the bad guy who's throwing, I don't know, little purple waves at you.

534
00:54:05,300 --> 00:54:05,980
[SPEAKER_18]: And if you...

535
00:54:07,561 --> 00:54:24,782
[SPEAKER_18]: I guess what you do is you store up these icons that you collect and then you unleash the moves or if you're in the Beatmania stage, you unleash your DJ power and it slowly converts the background from something boring into like a nightclub or a dance club or a karaoke bar or something kind of cool like that.

536
00:54:25,743 --> 00:54:27,165
[SPEAKER_18]: It's a little bit of a silly game.

537
00:54:27,705 --> 00:54:30,087
[SPEAKER_18]: But what they're doing is that they're actually giving away prizes.

538
00:54:30,147 --> 00:54:34,170
[SPEAKER_18]: If you get a high score, you can submit your score to the scoreboard, and they're giving away prizes.

539
00:54:34,290 --> 00:54:38,474
[SPEAKER_18]: Not to the top scorer, but just people who submit their scores to the scoreboard.

540
00:54:38,494 --> 00:54:41,876
[SPEAKER_18]: So it's a random contest, which I think is kind of cool.

541
00:54:42,156 --> 00:54:45,279
[SPEAKER_18]: But some of the people on there, oh my god, some of the scores are really high.

542
00:54:45,339 --> 00:54:48,321
[SPEAKER_18]: Some of the people are playing this game into level 35 and stuff.

543
00:54:48,842 --> 00:54:53,425
[SPEAKER_18]: I got bored of this game after... I'm visiting the website right now, so if you hear some stuff in the background...

544
00:54:55,345 --> 00:55:00,147
[SPEAKER_18]: I got kind of bored of it after like level 3, but I wanted to be able to show the folks in studio what this is like.

545
00:55:00,547 --> 00:55:05,750
[SPEAKER_18]: If you want to check out this game for yourself, it's called The Ultimate Club Promoter Online Game is what it's called.

546
00:55:06,070 --> 00:55:09,651
[SPEAKER_18]: It's located at www.musicineverydirection.com.

547
00:55:10,032 --> 00:55:15,474
[SPEAKER_18]: If you want to go directly to the game, go to musicineverydirection.com slash morphed.

548
00:55:16,377 --> 00:55:17,617
[SPEAKER_18]: M-O-R-P-H-E-D

549
00:55:40,148 --> 00:55:47,294
[SPEAKER_18]: DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

550
00:56:01,781 --> 00:56:06,544
[SPEAKER_18]: I want to know what suckers they got to be the, uh, the captures for this.

551
00:56:06,584 --> 00:56:07,205
[SPEAKER_18]: That's a little silly.

552
00:56:07,245 --> 00:56:08,166
[SPEAKER_18]: Anyway, you get the idea there.

553
00:56:08,186 --> 00:56:11,228
[SPEAKER_04]: That game looks like the ultimate in retarded.

554
00:56:11,288 --> 00:56:12,449
[SPEAKER_18]: It's a little silly.

555
00:56:12,529 --> 00:56:14,570
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay, enough funk boogie.

556
00:56:14,590 --> 00:56:14,870
[SPEAKER_18]: Shut up.

557
00:56:14,890 --> 00:56:15,231
[SPEAKER_18]: Alright.

558
00:56:16,189 --> 00:56:17,870
[SPEAKER_18]: Let's see what they're giving away here on this side.

559
00:56:17,890 --> 00:56:19,691
[SPEAKER_18]: You have until January 30th, 2006.

560
00:56:20,491 --> 00:56:34,438
[SPEAKER_18]: If you get first place, you get a copy of either Ultramix 3 or Extreme 2, a copy of Karaoke Revolution Party, a t-shirt and CDs, which most of us all already own, except for the t-shirt.

561
00:56:35,338 --> 00:56:37,179
[SPEAKER_18]: And some of us even have the t-shirt.

562
00:56:37,199 --> 00:56:41,421
[SPEAKER_18]: My t-shirt is Beatmania, though, which I don't think is one of the prizes here, so that's kind of special.

563
00:56:43,615 --> 00:56:45,757
[SPEAKER_18]: MusicInEveryDirection.com MusicInEveryDirection.com

564
00:57:08,001 --> 00:57:10,704
[SPEAKER_18]: I could have not told you about that and had more of a chance to win myself.

565
00:57:11,505 --> 00:57:15,348
[SPEAKER_18]: But we're nice here at Orange Laundry Radio and we want to share with you guys what's going on.

566
00:57:18,932 --> 00:57:25,919
[SPEAKER_18]: Also in the news, one other little thing here I wanted to say.

567
00:57:28,381 --> 00:57:29,483
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh yeah, Songpack...

568
00:57:31,413 --> 00:57:38,479
[SPEAKER_18]: 14, and SongPack 26 are out on Xbox Live Ultramix 3, DDR Ultramix 3.

569
00:57:39,440 --> 00:57:42,723
[SPEAKER_18]: SongPack 26 is rumored to only be out there for a limited time.

570
00:57:42,783 --> 00:57:44,465
[SPEAKER_18]: It's going to disappear by the new year.

571
00:57:44,845 --> 00:57:47,548
[SPEAKER_18]: So SongPack 26 is kind of like a Christmas present.

572
00:57:47,888 --> 00:57:53,113
[SPEAKER_18]: It's free, it's one song, it's a remix of Love Me Do, and it sucks.

573
00:57:53,553 --> 00:57:54,994
[SPEAKER_18]: It really sucks.

574
00:57:55,995 --> 00:57:58,257
[SPEAKER_18]: The steps are kind of fun though, so it's definitely worth a download.

575
00:57:58,277 --> 00:58:00,018
[SPEAKER_18]: And hey, it's free, so you can't complain too much.

576
00:58:00,679 --> 00:58:01,139
[SPEAKER_18]: Free song.

577
00:58:03,641 --> 00:58:04,062
[SPEAKER_18]: So anyway.

578
00:58:07,865 --> 00:58:13,009
[SPEAKER_18]: If you hit an animal crossing, if you hit start, you can do end the party or whatever, and that'll boot everybody from the village.

579
00:58:14,409 --> 00:58:16,410
[SPEAKER_18]: Anyway, Song Pack 14.

580
00:58:17,250 --> 00:58:22,013
[SPEAKER_18]: Song Pack 14 is out as well, and I'm doing this off the top of my head, but it has a new Neveraka song in it.

581
00:58:22,493 --> 00:58:24,334
[SPEAKER_18]: It has, I think it's called Evolution.

582
00:58:24,434 --> 00:58:25,854
[SPEAKER_18]: It has Gamelan Da Couple.

583
00:58:26,154 --> 00:58:29,636
[SPEAKER_18]: But I thought it was funny because they don't credit Gamelan Da Couple to Tomosuke.

584
00:58:29,676 --> 00:58:32,797
[SPEAKER_18]: They credit it to DJ Mojo or something like that.

585
00:58:32,857 --> 00:58:33,118
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't know.

586
00:58:33,138 --> 00:58:34,818
[SPEAKER_18]: They give it a different credit, which I thought was weird.

587
00:58:36,079 --> 00:58:41,942
[SPEAKER_18]: Also in there was a remix of Ghost Revival, I want to say.

588
00:58:41,962 --> 00:58:42,042
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah.

589
00:58:43,322 --> 00:58:46,764
[SPEAKER_18]: and some other crappy remix I think was in there too.

590
00:58:47,224 --> 00:58:48,605
[SPEAKER_18]: Really nothing to scream about.

591
00:58:49,426 --> 00:58:51,567
[SPEAKER_18]: I haven't been too excited over these songpacks.

592
00:58:51,927 --> 00:58:58,150
[SPEAKER_18]: But judging from the general reaction on DDR Freak, it seems to be getting an okay reception, especially when it comes to the steps.

593
00:58:58,511 --> 00:58:59,451
[SPEAKER_18]: Because I will give it that.

594
00:58:59,531 --> 00:59:01,792
[SPEAKER_18]: The steps are something kind of new.

595
00:59:02,153 --> 00:59:06,115
[SPEAKER_18]: And especially in one song that I played, I want to say it was the Ghost Revival remix.

596
00:59:07,736 --> 00:59:09,277
[SPEAKER_18]: or something about Brazilian Anthem.

597
00:59:09,637 --> 00:59:12,119
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't know if that was a previous Bomani song or if that's just coming from nowhere.

598
00:59:13,600 --> 00:59:25,008
[SPEAKER_18]: They all have some kind of interesting steps, like patterns you don't usually see in DDR, which is kind of phenomenal when you consider they've done hundreds and hundreds of DDR songs at this point, and there's only the four arrows.

599
00:59:25,028 --> 00:59:26,989
[SPEAKER_18]: There's only so many different types of patterns you can do.

600
00:59:27,309 --> 00:59:34,394
[SPEAKER_18]: You kind of see some different stuff happening in these songs, so you have that to look forward to to download.

601
00:59:35,086 --> 00:59:36,687
[SPEAKER_18]: So check that out over on Xbox Live.

602
00:59:38,968 --> 00:59:39,288
[SPEAKER_18]: All right.

603
00:59:39,308 --> 00:59:46,011
[SPEAKER_18]: Now, I know you guys haven't had a chance to check out these song packs, so I wouldn't expect that you already have this up or whatever.

604
00:59:47,852 --> 00:59:49,653
[SPEAKER_18]: Anyway, we are going to open up our Skype line.

605
00:59:49,733 --> 00:59:52,294
[SPEAKER_18]: It's over at www.orangehonestradio.com.

606
00:59:52,314 --> 00:59:54,575
[SPEAKER_18]: Click on Interact With Us, and you can...

607
00:59:56,465 --> 00:59:57,466
[SPEAKER_18]: Call us on the skyline.

608
00:59:57,806 --> 00:59:58,886
[SPEAKER_18]: Also, we have a phone number.

609
00:59:58,906 --> 01:00:01,588
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't give out the phone number enough, but you don't even have to have the internet.

610
01:00:01,628 --> 01:00:03,609
[SPEAKER_18]: If you just want to call us, you can actually do that.

611
01:00:04,169 --> 01:00:08,051
[SPEAKER_18]: The phone number is area code 916-226-9067.

612
01:00:08,411 --> 01:00:10,873
[SPEAKER_18]: But kids, please get your parents' permission before calling.

613
01:00:12,093 --> 01:00:14,495
[SPEAKER_18]: Otherwise, when the phone bill comes in, you might be in big trouble.

614
01:00:16,115 --> 01:00:17,196
[SPEAKER_18]: So the skyline is open.

615
01:00:17,216 --> 01:00:18,797
[SPEAKER_18]: There is a new version of Skype out.

616
01:00:19,457 --> 01:00:19,897
[SPEAKER_18]: However...

617
01:00:22,361 --> 01:00:26,683
[SPEAKER_18]: We don't know if it's widely out there yet.

618
01:00:26,703 --> 01:00:27,964
[SPEAKER_18]: A lot of you guys probably don't have it.

619
01:00:28,004 --> 01:00:28,504
[SPEAKER_18]: We don't have it.

620
01:00:29,185 --> 01:00:30,525
[SPEAKER_18]: We're getting a call, so let's go to it.

621
01:00:32,146 --> 01:00:33,707
[SPEAKER_18]: Hello, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

622
01:00:34,287 --> 01:00:35,248
[SPEAKER_18]: Hey, Skye, Siggy here.

623
01:00:35,648 --> 01:00:36,388
[SPEAKER_18]: Hey, how you doing?

624
01:00:36,408 --> 01:00:36,949
[SPEAKER_18]: What's on your mind?

625
01:00:37,829 --> 01:00:46,634
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, I just want to say, you know, Christmas is already coming in a week, and, you know, for Christians over there, Merry Christmas to everyone.

626
01:00:49,771 --> 01:00:52,252
[SPEAKER_18]: and a happy holidays to you too, my friend.

627
01:00:52,292 --> 01:00:57,294
[SPEAKER_18]: Christmas, Hanukkah, Kwanzaa, Festivus, whatever the case may be for you folks out there.

628
01:00:57,674 --> 01:00:59,295
[SPEAKER_18]: A politically correct winner to you.

629
01:01:01,696 --> 01:01:07,498
[SPEAKER_16]: Have you ever watched the video of Love Is Dreamin' Us, you know, the beat from the Beatmania US where LED is playing?

630
01:01:09,358 --> 01:01:09,999
[SPEAKER_16]: What song again?

631
01:01:10,059 --> 01:01:10,839
[SPEAKER_16]: Love Is Feelin'?

632
01:01:11,359 --> 01:01:12,280
[SPEAKER_18]: Love Is Dreamin' Us.

633
01:01:12,380 --> 01:01:13,340
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh, Love Is Dreamin' Us.

634
01:01:13,460 --> 01:01:14,320
[SPEAKER_18]: No, what is this about?

635
01:01:15,201 --> 01:01:18,542
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh, Love Is Dreamin' Us is confirmed for Beatmania US.

636
01:01:23,075 --> 01:01:23,796
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay, right on.

637
01:01:26,017 --> 01:01:26,597
[SPEAKER_18]: So what's this?

638
01:01:26,637 --> 01:01:29,479
[SPEAKER_18]: There's a video of him out there actually playing it on the internet?

639
01:01:29,519 --> 01:01:30,099
[SPEAKER_18]: Or what's going on?

640
01:01:31,400 --> 01:01:36,684
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, he did play Love is Dreamin' this.

641
01:01:36,924 --> 01:01:44,208
[SPEAKER_16]: He plays on the Player 2 side, and he got an A for playing it, even though it's 134k on his score.

642
01:01:44,709 --> 01:01:45,929
[SPEAKER_18]: Where did this video come from?

643
01:01:45,989 --> 01:01:49,272
[SPEAKER_18]: Was it him playing on an arcade machine, or was it him playing on Beatmania USA?

644
01:01:49,352 --> 01:01:50,092
[SPEAKER_18]: Where was it taken?

645
01:01:50,352 --> 01:01:51,453
[SPEAKER_18]: What is this going on here?

646
01:01:52,737 --> 01:02:02,061
[SPEAKER_16]: I think somebody linked it on Bimani Style or VG Army where LED is playing Beatmania US with a 2DX controller.

647
01:02:03,601 --> 01:02:05,102
[SPEAKER_04]: With one of the official ones?

648
01:02:05,942 --> 01:02:06,943
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, the KOC one.

649
01:02:07,263 --> 01:02:08,623
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, that's pretty cool.

650
01:02:10,804 --> 01:02:12,705
[SPEAKER_04]: And they haven't altered it or anything?

651
01:02:12,745 --> 01:02:15,326
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it's exactly as the Japanese one?

652
01:02:16,066 --> 01:02:16,927
[SPEAKER_04]: Like video and everything?

653
01:02:17,327 --> 01:02:19,268
[SPEAKER_16]: The video itself is exactly from the Japanese.

654
01:02:20,908 --> 01:02:22,129
[SPEAKER_04]: I think you just cut out a little bit.

655
01:02:24,983 --> 01:02:26,084
[SPEAKER_18]: We were losing you a little bit there.

656
01:02:26,164 --> 01:02:27,286
[SPEAKER_18]: I think you're back here.

657
01:02:27,346 --> 01:02:28,167
[SPEAKER_18]: You're here for a minute there.

658
01:02:28,447 --> 01:02:29,388
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, I can hear you.

659
01:02:29,508 --> 01:02:30,610
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay, that's weird.

660
01:02:31,611 --> 01:02:36,077
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay, so it has the same video and everything, so not a lot's changed there.

661
01:02:36,778 --> 01:02:37,519
[SPEAKER_18]: Nothing's changed.

662
01:02:38,792 --> 01:02:45,677
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay, so the only thing that made me disappointed was the scoring, so I think they better tune that up to the standard.

663
01:02:45,997 --> 01:02:47,498
[SPEAKER_16]: Did it have the art at the end?

664
01:02:49,359 --> 01:02:50,320
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, the score result?

665
01:02:50,720 --> 01:02:50,920
[SPEAKER_16]: No.

666
01:02:53,001 --> 01:02:56,524
[SPEAKER_18]: Is it an early build of the game, or are they thinking it's the final build, or what?

667
01:02:57,704 --> 01:02:59,245
[SPEAKER_16]: Some semi-final build.

668
01:03:00,166 --> 01:03:00,946
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay, interesting.

669
01:03:01,227 --> 01:03:02,607
[SPEAKER_16]: It's the last purple interface.

670
01:03:03,548 --> 01:03:06,310
[SPEAKER_18]: How are you feeling about Beatmania USA at this point?

671
01:03:07,062 --> 01:03:07,963
[SPEAKER_16]: Hmm.

672
01:03:08,824 --> 01:03:21,736
[SPEAKER_16]: If they don't put any goalie background result videos, I mean background images of goalie arts, I don't think I'll, you know, I'll think about buying it or not.

673
01:03:22,897 --> 01:03:24,238
[SPEAKER_18]: But what about those new controllers?

674
01:03:24,258 --> 01:03:25,539
[SPEAKER_18]: You know, the rumor of the new controllers.

675
01:03:25,719 --> 01:03:28,002
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, you probably have an arcade style, so what do you care, right?

676
01:03:28,022 --> 01:03:28,082
[SPEAKER_18]: Hmm.

677
01:03:29,178 --> 01:03:31,259
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, KOC, not Arcade Stock Controller.

678
01:03:32,799 --> 01:03:37,801
[SPEAKER_18]: But the rumor is that the Konami controller they're going to release here stateside is better than the one in Japan.

679
01:03:38,521 --> 01:03:41,622
[SPEAKER_18]: I heard from Floatwalker that it's going to be spring-loaded.

680
01:03:42,342 --> 01:03:43,422
[SPEAKER_18]: Mmm, interesting.

681
01:03:44,642 --> 01:03:47,443
[SPEAKER_18]: And of course, all this kind of stuff is a matter of preference as well.

682
01:03:47,483 --> 01:03:52,005
[SPEAKER_18]: There's nothing to say that one is better than the other, because that all kind of stuff is relative, but...

683
01:03:54,952 --> 01:03:55,712
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't know.

684
01:03:55,752 --> 01:04:11,636
[SPEAKER_18]: I mean, if it doesn't stick as much and they do a different kind of thing with the keys so the buttons don't stick, they'll do that whole thing, or it has a slightly different look maybe to it or whatever, it could be a more widely popular controller.

685
01:04:12,556 --> 01:04:12,876
[SPEAKER_18]: We'll see.

686
01:04:12,896 --> 01:04:16,357
[SPEAKER_16]: Speaking of sticking, I just noticed on my controller...

687
01:04:17,137 --> 01:04:28,660
[SPEAKER_16]: Like, I don't exactly press the center of the key, but I mostly, on the white keys I press the top, and then the black keys I press on the bottom, and then there are like scratches that causes the, you know, that causes the stickiness.

688
01:04:31,557 --> 01:04:32,998
[SPEAKER_04]: You should do what I did with mine.

689
01:04:33,018 --> 01:04:34,218
[SPEAKER_04]: Drop it off the top of the van.

690
01:04:34,258 --> 01:04:34,978
[SPEAKER_04]: It's never broken.

691
01:04:36,979 --> 01:04:38,580
[SPEAKER_18]: I can't imagine how that worked.

692
01:04:39,280 --> 01:04:39,920
[SPEAKER_18]: That would kill me.

693
01:04:41,261 --> 01:04:47,383
[SPEAKER_04]: It happened at Anime Expo 2001, I think, which is when I first got my controller.

694
01:04:48,084 --> 01:04:52,625
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was unloading it from the van, and it stuck up at the very top, and it fell face down.

695
01:04:53,566 --> 01:04:58,588
[SPEAKER_04]: But my controller has never stuck, except one key, and I cleaned it, and it worked.

696
01:04:59,568 --> 01:05:03,450
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like my controller is the super controller of all 2DX controllers.

697
01:05:03,530 --> 01:05:06,932
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm thinking the Virgin Mary lives in your controller or something because that's a miracle.

698
01:05:07,392 --> 01:05:10,894
[SPEAKER_04]: I know, I should probably, you know, take a picture of the circuit board and say, look, it's Jesus.

699
01:05:11,434 --> 01:05:12,554
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, you really should.

700
01:05:13,355 --> 01:05:15,216
[SPEAKER_16]: Have you ever tried to bash something on DarkSakura?

701
01:05:16,069 --> 01:05:16,549
[SPEAKER_04]: To do what?

702
01:05:17,129 --> 01:05:17,989
[SPEAKER_16]: The Vaseline mod?

703
01:05:18,349 --> 01:05:19,030
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I haven't.

704
01:05:19,070 --> 01:05:20,750
[SPEAKER_04]: All I've done is just clean the contacts.

705
01:05:22,070 --> 01:05:26,131
[SPEAKER_16]: I've been doing it every two weeks whenever I play 2DX.

706
01:05:27,631 --> 01:05:28,511
[SPEAKER_16]: And it works fine.

707
01:05:29,331 --> 01:05:35,912
[SPEAKER_04]: I actually never had any problem with my... It was only one of them that stuck, and that was the one that I would always slam on with my thumb.

708
01:05:36,913 --> 01:05:40,853
[SPEAKER_04]: And I just rotated the keys, cleaned them out, worked just fine.

709
01:05:42,434 --> 01:05:44,734
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, what bothers me is playing on the shaved ones.

710
01:05:45,829 --> 01:05:46,970
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't like shaved keys.

711
01:05:46,990 --> 01:05:47,730
[SPEAKER_04]: That's irritating.

712
01:05:47,830 --> 01:05:55,054
[SPEAKER_04]: And I don't actually like the ones where they put the little bit of rubber or foam under the key to press the contact up.

713
01:05:57,075 --> 01:05:57,795
[SPEAKER_04]: That's not comfortable.

714
01:05:58,215 --> 01:06:03,438
[SPEAKER_18]: Sorry, it's just really funny because you guys are talking about putting Vaseline on your keys and shaving it and all this other stuff.

715
01:06:03,458 --> 01:06:05,179
[SPEAKER_18]: You are a pervert, Mr. Rob.

716
01:06:05,199 --> 01:06:07,340
[SPEAKER_18]: My mind is going right to third grade.

717
01:06:07,960 --> 01:06:10,782
[SPEAKER_18]: Can you actually use KY for the mod as well?

718
01:06:11,162 --> 01:06:13,463
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sure KY would work just as well as Vaseline.

719
01:06:18,516 --> 01:06:21,359
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm going to shave my controller and put KY all over it.

720
01:06:24,601 --> 01:06:25,262
[SPEAKER_04]: Where's the spirit?

721
01:06:25,282 --> 01:06:26,403
[SPEAKER_04]: I need to hit Bob with something.

722
01:06:26,743 --> 01:06:28,604
[SPEAKER_18]: I was having it sit in for you earlier.

723
01:06:30,566 --> 01:06:30,946
[SPEAKER_18]: I had it.

724
01:06:31,186 --> 01:06:35,950
[SPEAKER_18]: Apparently several people in our chat room want ass.

725
01:06:36,531 --> 01:06:40,093
[SPEAKER_18]: Lube up those controllers, kids, and go to town.

726
01:06:40,113 --> 01:06:43,336
[SPEAKER_18]: I do have a lot of apples.

727
01:06:43,356 --> 01:06:43,536
[SPEAKER_18]: All right.

728
01:06:43,556 --> 01:06:44,557
[SPEAKER_16]: Siggy, I'm going to go ahead and let you go.

729
01:06:44,597 --> 01:06:45,598
[SPEAKER_16]: Any final thoughts, my friend?

730
01:06:46,297 --> 01:06:53,159
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, nothing much else to say, but hopefully next year you get a Skype 2.0 so you can see what I really look like.

731
01:06:54,980 --> 01:07:03,262
[SPEAKER_18]: I fear some of our listeners, I mean, not you so much, my friend, but some of our listeners might be listening to us in the nude, or God knows what.

732
01:07:03,302 --> 01:07:05,083
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't know if I want that webcam on everybody.

733
01:07:05,503 --> 01:07:05,623
[SPEAKER_16]: Right.

734
01:07:05,643 --> 01:07:06,023
[SPEAKER_18]: So we'll see.

735
01:07:07,464 --> 01:07:07,804
[SPEAKER_18]: All right.

736
01:07:09,804 --> 01:07:11,765
[SPEAKER_18]: All right, my friend, I'm going to let you go so we can get to another call, okay?

737
01:07:12,148 --> 01:07:18,252
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, and happy new year to Orange Lounge Radio in case we don't see each other.

738
01:07:20,033 --> 01:07:24,917
[SPEAKER_18]: We're going to do something next week, but it's not going to be a live show, but we should be here in two weeks.

739
01:07:25,077 --> 01:07:25,377
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't know.

740
01:07:25,397 --> 01:07:28,399
[SPEAKER_18]: I have to talk to the crew about that when we're on a break or something.

741
01:07:29,280 --> 01:07:31,661
[SPEAKER_18]: But happy new year to you as well.

742
01:07:31,781 --> 01:07:33,002
[SPEAKER_18]: Have a good holiday season.

743
01:07:33,602 --> 01:07:33,803
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah.

744
01:07:34,043 --> 01:07:34,263
[SPEAKER_18]: All right.

745
01:07:34,963 --> 01:07:35,183
[SPEAKER_16]: Later.

746
01:07:35,384 --> 01:07:35,644
[SPEAKER_16]: Take care.

747
01:07:35,664 --> 01:07:35,724
[SPEAKER_16]: Bye.

748
01:07:37,827 --> 01:07:41,528
[SPEAKER_18]: All right, we're going to do one more call here, and then we're going to take a break and try to get some frickin' air in here.

749
01:07:42,188 --> 01:07:46,789
[SPEAKER_18]: I actually turned on the air conditioner, so the people out front are going to kill me because it's cold out front, but oh well, they can deal.

750
01:07:47,549 --> 01:07:48,429
[SPEAKER_18]: Let's go to another break here.

751
01:07:48,449 --> 01:07:50,069
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what blankets and jackets are for.

752
01:07:50,910 --> 01:07:51,770
[SPEAKER_18]: Not a break, a call.

753
01:07:51,830 --> 01:07:53,010
[SPEAKER_18]: Hi, you're on Orange Lawns Radio.

754
01:07:54,310 --> 01:07:54,650
[SPEAKER_18]: Hello.

755
01:07:54,950 --> 01:07:55,670
[SPEAKER_18]: Hi, who's this?

756
01:07:56,911 --> 01:07:57,691
[SPEAKER_18]: Xander from Florida.

757
01:07:57,951 --> 01:07:59,211
[SPEAKER_18]: Hello, Xander from Florida.

758
01:07:59,231 --> 01:07:59,891
[SPEAKER_18]: What's on your mind?

759
01:08:01,552 --> 01:08:03,112
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, not a whole lot.

760
01:08:03,412 --> 01:08:03,512
[SPEAKER_01]: Um...

761
01:08:05,578 --> 01:08:07,600
[SPEAKER_01]: Have an interesting anecdote, if you're willing to hear it.

762
01:08:08,401 --> 01:08:09,242
[SPEAKER_01]: An anecdote?

763
01:08:09,362 --> 01:08:10,784
[SPEAKER_01]: We haven't heard... Okay, sure, why not?

764
01:08:11,224 --> 01:08:12,746
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a short one, so don't worry.

765
01:08:12,966 --> 01:08:14,147
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright, what's on your mind?

766
01:08:15,268 --> 01:08:15,508
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

767
01:08:17,130 --> 01:08:20,013
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll admit, I'm a bit... I'm a bit of a fanboy.

768
01:08:20,974 --> 01:08:22,996
[SPEAKER_01]: Up to... A fanboy of Orange Lounge Radio?

769
01:08:23,016 --> 01:08:23,716
[SPEAKER_18]: That's really sweet.

770
01:08:23,936 --> 01:08:24,477
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh, I'm sorry.

771
01:08:24,717 --> 01:08:25,457
[SPEAKER_01]: Fanboy for what?

772
01:08:26,078 --> 01:08:38,187
[SPEAKER_01]: Sort of, but... I'm a bit of a Sony and Nintendo fanboy, and for a while I was kind of down on the PSP, but I never played it, right?

773
01:08:38,647 --> 01:08:38,927
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay.

774
01:08:39,428 --> 01:08:44,651
[SPEAKER_01]: Just reading stuff on the internet, it's like, oh yeah, I don't like any games on the PSP, blah blah blah.

775
01:08:45,962 --> 01:08:50,683
[SPEAKER_01]: But since I don't really have any kiosks, I never really got a chance to play it or anything.

776
01:08:50,984 --> 01:08:53,384
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, I mean, I'd seen it, but I never really got a chance to play it.

777
01:08:54,185 --> 01:09:04,428
[SPEAKER_01]: So, let's see, two days ago, I was at this Christmas party with my friend, and he's a Nintendo fanboy, and he had a DS for a long time.

778
01:09:05,548 --> 01:09:08,169
[SPEAKER_01]: And it broke for a second time somehow.

779
01:09:08,409 --> 01:09:10,050
[SPEAKER_01]: He must be abusing that thing if it's breaking.

780
01:09:10,070 --> 01:09:11,450
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know how, but he's breaking it.

781
01:09:11,770 --> 01:09:16,060
[SPEAKER_18]: He's shaving it and using KY apparently on it, which you shouldn't do with a DS.

782
01:09:16,160 --> 01:09:20,669
[SPEAKER_18]: You can do that with a 2DX controller, but please kids, do not shave and lube your DS.

783
01:09:20,930 --> 01:09:21,672
[SPEAKER_18]: It does not like it.

784
01:09:23,664 --> 01:09:24,144
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyways.

785
01:09:24,985 --> 01:09:30,589
[SPEAKER_18]: If the animals in Animal Crossing are asking you to shave your DS, just seriously, it's time to go outdoors.

786
01:09:31,109 --> 01:09:32,550
[SPEAKER_18]: It is time to go out in the real outdoors.

787
01:09:32,790 --> 01:09:33,531
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm sorry, go ahead.

788
01:09:34,371 --> 01:09:35,532
[SPEAKER_18]: It broke for the second time.

789
01:09:37,934 --> 01:09:38,414
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyways.

790
01:09:39,515 --> 01:09:41,596
[SPEAKER_01]: So he gets it, and he brings it.

791
01:09:41,636 --> 01:09:44,738
[SPEAKER_01]: He buys Tokobots and a few UMDs and stuff.

792
01:09:46,199 --> 01:09:50,282
[SPEAKER_01]: So he brings it, and I start playing it, and I'm like, hey, this is actually pretty fun.

793
01:09:51,683 --> 01:09:51,763
[SPEAKER_01]: Um.

794
01:09:53,021 --> 01:10:02,443
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I mean, it doesn't necessarily have, it's not, it doesn't have all the games that are my taste, but, you know, I don't expect that.

795
01:10:03,183 --> 01:10:05,204
[SPEAKER_01]: But I actually had some fun with it, you know.

796
01:10:06,224 --> 01:10:16,646
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I mean, I guess, really, you shouldn't diss a system, even if you look at the games, and you look at the reviews, and they all suck.

797
01:10:17,879 --> 01:10:19,181
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't listen until you play it.

798
01:10:20,282 --> 01:10:20,743
[SPEAKER_01]: Seriously.

799
01:10:21,504 --> 01:10:23,026
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, unless it's an N-Gage.

800
01:10:23,126 --> 01:10:23,807
[SPEAKER_18]: We need to add that.

801
01:10:24,729 --> 01:10:30,657
[SPEAKER_18]: However, you draw some interesting parallels here because you could say the same thing about an Xbox 360, no?

802
01:10:32,301 --> 01:10:34,842
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, I'm anti-Xbox.

803
01:10:34,942 --> 01:10:36,262
[SPEAKER_18]: I know, because you said you're Sony.

804
01:10:36,342 --> 01:10:38,983
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I have played Xbox, though, and I think that's the difference.

805
01:10:39,643 --> 01:10:53,268
[SPEAKER_18]: What's interesting about this, and I'm kind of just thinking out loud here, this is all kind of coming together as I'm sitting here talking, which is not normal for me to just talk out my ass, but you got the PSP thing going on, right?

806
01:10:53,288 --> 01:10:53,868
[SPEAKER_18]: And the PSP

807
01:10:54,928 --> 01:11:03,633
[SPEAKER_18]: If you put the PSP and the DS side by side, and you want a system that is strictly the better gaming system, I honestly think it's the DS is the better gaming system.

808
01:11:03,693 --> 01:11:06,174
[SPEAKER_18]: But of course, it also depends on the kind of games you like.

809
01:11:06,535 --> 01:11:08,836
[SPEAKER_18]: I mean, the DS has a different type of game, so you got that.

810
01:11:09,136 --> 01:11:09,777
[SPEAKER_18]: But the PSP...

811
01:11:11,298 --> 01:11:20,109
[SPEAKER_18]: The PSP is a sexy ass system for one, but the PSP allows you to do so much else on it.

812
01:11:20,129 --> 01:11:23,773
[SPEAKER_18]: Especially when you consider this 2.6 firmware upgrade.

813
01:11:23,933 --> 01:11:26,556
[SPEAKER_18]: You either can upgrade your firmware or you don't upgrade your firmware.

814
01:11:26,857 --> 01:11:29,240
[SPEAKER_18]: You can upgrade your firmware and get podcasts.

815
01:11:29,600 --> 01:11:44,451
[SPEAKER_18]: and get pictures and get the internet wirelessly and get movies downloaded from the internet and get MP3s so it's practically like having an iPod or you can not upgrade your firmware to 1.5 and download that cool ass top down shooter.

816
01:11:44,831 --> 01:11:51,776
[SPEAKER_18]: You cannot upgrade your firmware and get all the homebrew applications including homemade shooters and emulators.

817
01:11:52,316 --> 01:11:56,359
[SPEAKER_18]: Although if all you want to buy a portable system for is to play NES games, that's a whole other issue.

818
01:11:57,619 --> 01:12:01,342
[SPEAKER_18]: So that's where the PSP really excels is at being a multimedia system.

819
01:12:02,042 --> 01:12:04,784
[SPEAKER_18]: So now flash forward to the current competition we've got going on here.

820
01:12:05,264 --> 01:12:06,365
[SPEAKER_18]: Xbox 360.

821
01:12:06,845 --> 01:12:10,268
[SPEAKER_18]: Not a lot of great games for the Xbox 360 right now.

822
01:12:10,588 --> 01:12:12,089
[SPEAKER_18]: Hopefully some good ones on the way.

823
01:12:13,058 --> 01:12:14,319
[SPEAKER_18]: Hopefully some good ones along the way.

824
01:12:14,599 --> 01:12:19,482
[SPEAKER_18]: But the Xbox 360 trying to sell itself as more as the multimedia thing.

825
01:12:20,103 --> 01:12:23,705
[SPEAKER_18]: The little white box that Microsoft wants in every living room.

826
01:12:24,106 --> 01:12:28,749
[SPEAKER_18]: Which is very interesting because that is how I see Sony positioning itself as well.

827
01:12:29,089 --> 01:12:31,891
[SPEAKER_18]: Sony wants to be that little box in everybody's living room as well.

828
01:12:32,231 --> 01:12:32,872
[SPEAKER_18]: Nintendo?

829
01:12:33,755 --> 01:12:35,015
[SPEAKER_18]: GameSpoiler

830
01:12:54,924 --> 01:12:56,085
[SPEAKER_18]: I think Iwata is a fucking genius.

831
01:12:57,005 --> 01:12:59,526
[SPEAKER_18]: I think he's taken the company in a brilliant direction.

832
01:13:14,333 --> 01:13:16,614
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes, but it is a big gamble as well.

833
01:13:16,694 --> 01:13:17,114
[SPEAKER_18]: It is.

834
01:13:17,494 --> 01:13:21,175
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think... They don't really have anywhere else to go.

835
01:13:21,235 --> 01:13:25,136
[SPEAKER_01]: If they just keep trying to battle Sony and Microsoft on their grounds, they're going to lose.

836
01:13:25,416 --> 01:13:28,177
[SPEAKER_18]: The revolution could crash and burn.

837
01:13:28,277 --> 01:13:34,359
[SPEAKER_18]: It could be another N-Gage and it wouldn't matter because they've still sold 50 kabillion Game Boys.

838
01:13:34,839 --> 01:13:39,640
[SPEAKER_18]: I think a billion is an actual number now because Nintendo has sold that many Game Boys in different forms.

839
01:13:40,220 --> 01:13:43,002
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, there's still more Game Boys than PS2s, I think.

840
01:13:43,362 --> 01:13:43,863
[SPEAKER_01]: Something like that.

841
01:13:58,453 --> 01:14:00,435
[SPEAKER_18]: So, I don't know.

842
01:14:00,815 --> 01:14:01,396
[SPEAKER_18]: It's just interesting.

843
01:14:01,436 --> 01:14:08,060
[SPEAKER_18]: I mean, Nintendo has dominated the handheld market, and I really don't see anybody posing a real threat to that anytime soon, not even the PSP.

844
01:14:08,381 --> 01:14:11,583
[SPEAKER_01]: The PSP is bringing in a new market, in my opinion.

845
01:14:11,803 --> 01:14:16,586
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think the PSP is getting the same people that the Game Boy and DS is getting.

846
01:14:16,707 --> 01:14:18,308
[SPEAKER_18]: Because it's not a gaming system at heart.

847
01:14:18,708 --> 01:14:18,968
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.

848
01:14:19,288 --> 01:14:21,010
[SPEAKER_01]: It's an entertainment-on-the-go system.

849
01:14:21,050 --> 01:14:21,230
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.

850
01:14:24,756 --> 01:14:27,558
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm getting yelled at in the chat room for calling the DS a Game Boy.

851
01:14:27,638 --> 01:14:29,360
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay, it's not really a Game Boy.

852
01:14:29,740 --> 01:14:32,722
[SPEAKER_18]: Technically, the DS is not a Game Boy, but give me this.

853
01:14:33,142 --> 01:14:35,124
[SPEAKER_18]: It does have a Game Boy Advance slot, right?

854
01:14:35,584 --> 01:14:40,228
[SPEAKER_18]: So that's what a lot of people are considering when they buy a DS is, oh, this will play all my Game Boy Advance games.

855
01:14:40,548 --> 01:14:47,513
[SPEAKER_18]: So while it might not be a Game Boy per se and it doesn't carry the Game Boy brand, it is the evolved form of the Game Boy.

856
01:14:48,134 --> 01:14:49,155
[SPEAKER_01]: But it still can't play Tetris.

857
01:14:49,884 --> 01:14:50,845
[SPEAKER_18]: But it still can't play Tetris.

858
01:14:51,325 --> 01:14:54,046
[SPEAKER_18]: But it could play if they re-release Tetris or whatever.

859
01:14:54,106 --> 01:14:59,369
[SPEAKER_18]: And since they re-released Dr. Mario and Puzzle League recently on one cartridge.

860
01:14:59,589 --> 01:15:01,470
[SPEAKER_18]: Did you notice they're not calling it Pokemon Puzzle League?

861
01:15:01,490 --> 01:15:02,471
[SPEAKER_18]: They're just calling it Puzzle League.

862
01:15:02,591 --> 01:15:03,371
[SPEAKER_18]: I thought that was very interesting.

863
01:15:04,472 --> 01:15:06,273
[SPEAKER_18]: Since they re-released that on one cartridge.

864
01:15:06,733 --> 01:15:09,134
[SPEAKER_01]: Has that come out over here?

865
01:15:09,194 --> 01:15:11,816
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm seeing ad banners for it on the internet, so I think it's out.

866
01:15:12,056 --> 01:15:15,938
[SPEAKER_18]: It's not a game I'm interested in because I actually have both games on other consoles.

867
01:15:15,998 --> 01:15:17,499
[SPEAKER_15]: It came out back in November.

868
01:15:17,898 --> 01:15:18,198
[SPEAKER_18]: Did it?

869
01:15:19,099 --> 01:15:20,621
[SPEAKER_18]: But it's not something I really care about.

870
01:15:21,201 --> 01:15:23,283
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, I didn't notice either because I already have both those games.

871
01:15:23,363 --> 01:15:24,684
[SPEAKER_18]: But I'm sure it's a great Christmas title.

872
01:15:27,507 --> 01:15:27,767
[SPEAKER_18]: Alright.

873
01:15:28,488 --> 01:15:30,990
[SPEAKER_18]: Anyway, Xander, appreciate the call.

874
01:15:31,391 --> 01:15:38,958
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm glad to hear that the PSP was, you know, you had a good experience with it because that sucks to be a fanboy of something and then get really let down.

875
01:15:40,560 --> 01:15:41,421
[SPEAKER_18]: You know what I mean?

876
01:15:41,541 --> 01:15:43,002
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's a bad thing to be a fanboy.

877
01:15:43,442 --> 01:15:47,966
[SPEAKER_01]: Because, you know, if you just stick to one thing, you'll never broaden your horizons.

878
01:15:48,266 --> 01:15:48,587
[SPEAKER_18]: Exactly.

879
01:15:49,247 --> 01:15:50,668
[SPEAKER_18]: Be careful when you get narrow-minded.

880
01:15:50,728 --> 01:15:52,350
[SPEAKER_18]: And especially in the case of Microsoft.

881
01:15:52,590 --> 01:15:55,032
[SPEAKER_18]: When the Xbox first came out, I hated it.

882
01:15:55,232 --> 01:16:01,057
[SPEAKER_18]: I thought it was a crap system because, remember the golden rule of gaming, the system is only as good as the games that are on it, right?

883
01:16:01,317 --> 01:16:07,502
[SPEAKER_18]: And the Xbox had nothing going for it until they started getting DDR, they started getting Fable, they started getting Halo.

884
01:16:07,822 --> 01:16:08,903
[SPEAKER_18]: And I like Halo.

885
01:16:08,923 --> 01:16:09,664
[SPEAKER_18]: I know a lot of people don't.

886
01:16:10,184 --> 01:16:11,784
[SPEAKER_18]: But they started getting some more games.

887
01:16:12,584 --> 01:16:12,785
[SPEAKER_18]: I know.

888
01:16:13,725 --> 01:16:17,625
[SPEAKER_18]: They started reaching out into other areas that weren't just sports and shooters.

889
01:16:18,045 --> 01:16:18,305
[SPEAKER_18]: You know?

890
01:16:19,146 --> 01:16:19,746
[SPEAKER_18]: But that's just me.

891
01:16:19,946 --> 01:16:20,706
[SPEAKER_04]: They had a Buffy game.

892
01:16:21,166 --> 01:16:22,166
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, and they did have a Buffy game.

893
01:16:22,846 --> 01:16:23,586
[SPEAKER_18]: Which is worth something.

894
01:16:24,446 --> 01:16:25,947
[SPEAKER_18]: Alright, Xander, we gotta let you go so we can go to break.

895
01:16:26,067 --> 01:16:27,747
[SPEAKER_18]: But thanks for calling as always, okay?

896
01:16:27,847 --> 01:16:28,787
[SPEAKER_18]: Any other thoughts for the listeners?

897
01:16:29,727 --> 01:16:30,868
[SPEAKER_01]: Your taste in music still sucks.

898
01:16:31,168 --> 01:16:31,448
[SPEAKER_18]: I know.

899
01:16:32,068 --> 01:16:34,668
[SPEAKER_18]: But I have a microphone and you don't.

900
01:16:34,768 --> 01:16:36,188
[SPEAKER_18]: So that's what it boils down to.

901
01:16:36,309 --> 01:16:37,049
[SPEAKER_18]: Alright, take care, buddy.

902
01:16:37,849 --> 01:16:38,069
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay.

903
01:16:38,309 --> 01:16:38,549
[SPEAKER_18]: Later.

904
01:16:39,540 --> 01:16:41,562
[SPEAKER_18]: Just for that, Xander's going to start his own radio station.

905
01:16:41,602 --> 01:16:44,804
[SPEAKER_18]: It's going to be Sky Sucks A Lot.

906
01:16:46,365 --> 01:16:46,966
[SPEAKER_18]: Hi, Extifer.

907
01:16:47,006 --> 01:16:47,346
[SPEAKER_18]: How are you?

908
01:16:47,466 --> 01:16:48,987
[SPEAKER_18]: Do we have a microphone?

909
01:16:49,007 --> 01:16:49,988
[SPEAKER_18]: We can say hello to Extifer.

910
01:16:53,203 --> 01:16:53,563
[SPEAKER_17]: Hello.

911
01:16:53,723 --> 01:16:54,524
[SPEAKER_17]: How are you, my friend?

912
01:16:55,504 --> 01:16:56,645
[SPEAKER_17]: I am fine, my friend.

913
01:16:57,225 --> 01:16:58,326
[SPEAKER_17]: Are you guys going out or something?

914
01:16:58,406 --> 01:16:59,426
[SPEAKER_17]: You have your sock.

915
01:16:59,527 --> 01:17:00,567
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm going to put this on and go.

916
01:17:01,147 --> 01:17:02,968
[SPEAKER_17]: We're going to Chipotle.

917
01:17:03,469 --> 01:17:04,029
[SPEAKER_17]: Yum, yum.

918
01:17:04,409 --> 01:17:04,789
[SPEAKER_17]: Sounds good.

919
01:17:07,491 --> 01:17:08,572
[SPEAKER_18]: Is it getting really cold out there?

920
01:17:08,592 --> 01:17:09,592
[SPEAKER_18]: Because we had to turn on the air.

921
01:17:09,872 --> 01:17:11,133
[SPEAKER_18]: We're burning up in here.

922
01:17:11,153 --> 01:17:11,353
[SPEAKER_17]: It's fine.

923
01:17:11,393 --> 01:17:12,274
[SPEAKER_17]: I like the coldness.

924
01:17:13,234 --> 01:17:15,055
[SPEAKER_18]: So you guys are leaving for a little bit so we can leave the door open?

925
01:17:15,095 --> 01:17:15,535
[SPEAKER_18]: That's good.

926
01:17:15,736 --> 01:17:17,456
[SPEAKER_17]: Did you want to do a movie review real quick before you go?

927
01:17:17,657 --> 01:17:18,657
[SPEAKER_17]: Are they waiting for you or what?

928
01:17:19,097 --> 01:17:21,219
[SPEAKER_17]: I could do a Diet Coke.

929
01:17:21,639 --> 01:17:21,839
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay.

930
01:17:23,192 --> 01:17:25,392
[SPEAKER_12]: Anybody else want anything from Chipotle?

931
01:17:25,473 --> 01:17:28,333
[SPEAKER_17]: I want some hot beans.

932
01:17:28,573 --> 01:17:29,013
[SPEAKER_18]: No, I don't know.

933
01:17:29,273 --> 01:17:30,153
[SPEAKER_18]: Hot beans?

934
01:17:30,734 --> 01:17:30,854
[SPEAKER_18]: Ew.

935
01:17:31,394 --> 01:17:34,094
[SPEAKER_18]: Do you want to do a movie review or do you want to wait until you get back or what?

936
01:17:34,294 --> 01:17:35,355
[SPEAKER_18]: Sure, I'll do a movie review.

937
01:17:35,435 --> 01:17:35,695
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay.

938
01:17:36,855 --> 01:17:37,575
[SPEAKER_18]: Let's do a movie review.

939
01:17:37,595 --> 01:17:43,356
[SPEAKER_18]: Because, you know, Live 365 might pull the plug on us tonight, and in which case, you know, we want to make sure that we got your movie review in.

940
01:17:43,836 --> 01:17:45,036
[SPEAKER_18]: Why would they pull the plug on you?

941
01:17:45,797 --> 01:17:47,097
[SPEAKER_18]: Because we're letting you on the show.

942
01:17:48,877 --> 01:17:48,977
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh.

943
01:17:49,017 --> 01:17:50,798
[SPEAKER_15]: Because we eat through a feeding tube.

944
01:17:50,818 --> 01:17:51,938
[SPEAKER_15]: What?

945
01:17:52,782 --> 01:17:53,662
[SPEAKER_17]: I saw Sarah Silverman's...

946
01:18:13,284 --> 01:18:15,387
[SPEAKER_12]: The Pussy?

947
01:18:15,908 --> 01:18:16,408
[SPEAKER_12]: What's it called?

948
01:18:16,789 --> 01:18:17,750
[SPEAKER_12]: Jesus is Magic.

949
01:18:18,932 --> 01:18:27,544
[SPEAKER_12]: And she's officially now my favorite comedian because she made jokes about waxed assholes and that was just like...

950
01:18:28,425 --> 01:18:29,786
[SPEAKER_12]: Sera Silverman's like...

951
01:18:57,905 --> 01:19:00,747
[SPEAKER_12]: No, there was 6 million people that died in that.

952
01:19:01,007 --> 01:19:03,388
[SPEAKER_12]: And her niece is like, no, what's the difference?

953
01:19:03,768 --> 01:19:08,771
[SPEAKER_12]: And she goes, well, 60 million is unforgivable.

954
01:19:11,692 --> 01:19:12,733
[SPEAKER_12]: This is great.

955
01:19:12,773 --> 01:19:14,534
[SPEAKER_18]: If you're easily offended, do not see this movie.

956
01:19:14,574 --> 01:19:16,755
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, she's so funny.

957
01:19:17,075 --> 01:19:19,136
[SPEAKER_18]: Everything is, nothing is off limits.

958
01:19:19,156 --> 01:19:20,977
[SPEAKER_18]: She talks about black people, Asians...

959
01:19:21,437 --> 01:19:50,113
[SPEAKER_12]: Jews, Women, Men, 9-11, Holocaust, AIDS American Airlines have a slogan Don't ruin all the jokes That one's the best because it'll make you like That offended people in the audience I don't need you alienating our listeners I don't care, I really don't care Your listeners like me enough to know that I really don't care So it was a good movie, I really liked it

960
01:19:52,075 --> 01:19:58,199
[SPEAKER_12]: The musical numbers were kind of weird, but... And then there was a weird masturbating scene in it, which was kind of weird, too.

961
01:19:58,399 --> 01:19:58,920
[SPEAKER_12]: Really hot.

962
01:19:59,100 --> 01:19:59,780
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.

963
01:20:00,261 --> 01:20:02,783
[SPEAKER_12]: So, but, otherwise, it was a good movie.

964
01:20:03,143 --> 01:20:03,683
[SPEAKER_12]: Go see it.

965
01:20:04,324 --> 01:20:06,485
[SPEAKER_12]: You may want to wait for it to come out on video.

966
01:20:06,906 --> 01:20:09,388
[SPEAKER_12]: Two thumbs up.

967
01:20:09,668 --> 01:20:14,491
[SPEAKER_12]: Two cocks up and a flaccid... Two cocks and a flaccid cock.

968
01:20:15,052 --> 01:20:16,193
[SPEAKER_12]: Wait, that's two cocks and a half.

969
01:20:17,389 --> 01:20:18,149
[SPEAKER_18]: Get out.

970
01:20:18,370 --> 01:20:18,690
[SPEAKER_18]: Get out.

971
01:20:19,070 --> 01:20:20,010
[SPEAKER_18]: Two cocks and a pussy.

972
01:20:20,050 --> 01:20:21,071
[SPEAKER_18]: Look, this segment's over.

973
01:20:21,191 --> 01:20:21,451
[SPEAKER_18]: Get out.

974
01:20:21,671 --> 01:20:21,971
[SPEAKER_18]: All right.

975
01:20:25,653 --> 01:20:27,934
[SPEAKER_18]: What kind of ranking scale is that?

976
01:20:27,954 --> 01:20:30,396
[SPEAKER_18]: I give it two cocks and a pussy.

977
01:20:30,496 --> 01:20:31,396
[SPEAKER_18]: It's a three-way.

978
01:20:31,656 --> 01:20:35,638
[SPEAKER_18]: It's a three... You're so weird.

979
01:20:36,319 --> 01:20:37,279
[SPEAKER_18]: All right.

980
01:20:38,200 --> 01:20:42,442
[SPEAKER_18]: We're going to go to a break, kids, and try to get some air, because we're dying in the hotbox.

981
01:20:42,882 --> 01:20:46,224
[SPEAKER_18]: And hopefully we'll be back, and either the plug will get pulled off... Hotbox.

982
01:20:47,694 --> 01:20:48,115
[SPEAKER_18]: Shut up.

983
01:20:48,797 --> 01:20:51,502
[SPEAKER_18]: We'll be back after this with more Orange Lounge Radio.

984
01:20:52,384 --> 01:20:54,748
[SPEAKER_18]: Hopefully we'll be back after this with more Orange Lounge Radio.

985
01:21:16,958 --> 01:21:20,008
[SPEAKER_19]: If you got a kid act like her father, if the baby ain't yours, then hey, why bother?

986
01:21:20,028 --> 01:21:20,771
[SPEAKER_19]: Don't try, boy.

987
01:21:20,951 --> 01:21:21,473
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm bad, boy.

988
01:23:32,542 --> 01:23:32,822
On a day

989
01:27:21,559 --> 01:27:26,403
[SPEAKER_09]: From the Step Squad to Orange Cloud, this PDR sucks!

990
01:27:26,483 --> 01:27:26,983
[SPEAKER_09]: Holla!

991
01:27:27,003 --> 01:27:28,144
[SPEAKER_09]: We are the winners!

992
01:27:35,882 --> 01:27:38,884
[SPEAKER_18]: And that break you heard Inside Your Heart by Akira Yamaoka.

993
01:27:38,924 --> 01:27:40,505
[SPEAKER_18]: Before that, A Day Like Today from In The Groove.

994
01:27:41,566 --> 01:27:42,667
[SPEAKER_18]: DJ Simon with Air.

995
01:27:42,807 --> 01:27:43,287
[SPEAKER_18]: You get it?

996
01:27:43,427 --> 01:27:44,728
[SPEAKER_18]: Joke, because we said we're breaking for air.

997
01:27:45,349 --> 01:27:48,691
[SPEAKER_18]: And my baby mama from DDR Solo starting that set off.

998
01:27:49,732 --> 01:27:51,013
[SPEAKER_18]: Hope you enjoyed that mix of music.

999
01:27:51,593 --> 01:27:54,755
[SPEAKER_18]: Here we are back on the show and we may or may not get the plug pulled.

1000
01:27:54,795 --> 01:27:57,978
[SPEAKER_18]: We'll see pretty soon here if we're going to get the plug pulled on us for maintenance.

1001
01:27:58,038 --> 01:28:00,559
[SPEAKER_18]: So again, if we go down, we are going to be down all night.

1002
01:28:00,640 --> 01:28:01,440
[SPEAKER_18]: So we apologize.

1003
01:28:02,101 --> 01:28:08,885
[SPEAKER_18]: But we thank you, of course, for sticking with us and listening, especially after last week because last week was kind of sucky because we had the plague, all of us.

1004
01:28:09,186 --> 01:28:14,389
[SPEAKER_18]: And it's so weird now because I don't feel sick at all, no remnants or anything.

1005
01:28:14,429 --> 01:28:15,170
[SPEAKER_18]: And I thank

1006
01:28:15,690 --> 01:28:19,654
[SPEAKER_18]: I still have the plague I know you still have the plague, but the mini-plague is gone

1007
01:28:41,058 --> 01:28:42,939
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm going to take that Airborne stuff more often now.

1008
01:28:43,079 --> 01:28:43,979
[SPEAKER_18]: That's some good stuff.

1009
01:28:44,019 --> 01:28:45,600
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm going to take one of those every day, see what happens.

1010
01:28:46,020 --> 01:28:47,501
[SPEAKER_18]: See if it makes me a strong boy.

1011
01:28:47,521 --> 01:28:48,642
[SPEAKER_04]: You could just take a multivitamin.

1012
01:28:49,482 --> 01:28:50,382
[SPEAKER_18]: I've thought about that, too.

1013
01:28:50,462 --> 01:28:54,304
[SPEAKER_18]: But the thing I like about Airborne is that it actually makes a drink, kind of.

1014
01:28:54,324 --> 01:28:55,365
[SPEAKER_18]: And the drink's not bad.

1015
01:28:55,505 --> 01:28:58,026
[SPEAKER_18]: I mean, I've had worse things in my life, so we'll see.

1016
01:28:58,306 --> 01:29:01,728
[SPEAKER_18]: It's one of those acquired taste kind of things.

1017
01:29:01,888 --> 01:29:02,188
[SPEAKER_18]: We'll see.

1018
01:29:03,140 --> 01:29:06,241
[SPEAKER_18]: Anyway, I'm curious here, because we're getting into the Christmas season.

1019
01:29:06,321 --> 01:29:09,282
[SPEAKER_18]: First, I want to know, what's on your Christmas list?

1020
01:29:09,702 --> 01:29:11,623
[SPEAKER_18]: I want to know what's on our host's Christmas list.

1021
01:29:11,643 --> 01:29:12,503
[SPEAKER_18]: What's on your Christmas list?

1022
01:29:12,803 --> 01:29:15,124
[SPEAKER_18]: Maybe gaming-wise, or maybe just anything-wise.

1023
01:29:15,664 --> 01:29:19,386
[SPEAKER_18]: And what your plans are for this lovely Christmas break coming up.

1024
01:29:19,566 --> 01:29:21,927
[SPEAKER_18]: Or Hanukkah, you know what I mean.

1025
01:29:21,967 --> 01:29:23,607
[SPEAKER_18]: When I say Christmas, I mean all that, okay?

1026
01:29:24,347 --> 01:29:26,628
[SPEAKER_18]: We are not going to be politically correct on this program.

1027
01:29:28,089 --> 01:29:30,950
[SPEAKER_18]: We're putting it all under the label of Christmas.

1028
01:29:31,790 --> 01:29:34,891
[SPEAKER_18]: which is probably not extremely politically correct, but you know how it goes.

1029
01:29:35,311 --> 01:29:36,931
[SPEAKER_18]: So, Loki, I'll start with you, my friend.

1030
01:29:36,971 --> 01:29:40,232
[SPEAKER_18]: What's on your Christmas list, and what are you going to do for the holidays?

1031
01:29:40,252 --> 01:29:43,153
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't really have anything on my Christmas list since I've already bought my 360.

1032
01:29:43,553 --> 01:29:49,254
[SPEAKER_15]: I just, probably an HDTV, I guess, if I were to ever get one.

1033
01:29:49,434 --> 01:29:51,955
[SPEAKER_15]: That would be almost impossible because they're expensive.

1034
01:29:53,215 --> 01:29:54,815
[SPEAKER_15]: But, other than that, I don't know.

1035
01:29:55,195 --> 01:29:56,516
[SPEAKER_15]: There's not really any games I want.

1036
01:29:57,636 --> 01:29:57,656
[SPEAKER_15]: I

1037
01:29:58,539 --> 01:29:59,660
[SPEAKER_15]: I have to wait, I guess.

1038
01:29:59,760 --> 01:30:04,784
[SPEAKER_15]: Dead or Alive, I guess I could try to go get that since that's supposed to come out this week.

1039
01:30:05,725 --> 01:30:06,965
[SPEAKER_15]: Assuming it doesn't get pushed back again.

1040
01:30:07,746 --> 01:30:08,867
[SPEAKER_18]: Just in time for the holiday.

1041
01:30:08,907 --> 01:30:10,908
[SPEAKER_18]: They're airing the commercials on TV and everything.

1042
01:30:10,968 --> 01:30:13,570
[SPEAKER_15]: Actually, no, I take that back.

1043
01:30:13,630 --> 01:30:14,411
[SPEAKER_15]: It's not coming out this week.

1044
01:30:14,451 --> 01:30:15,432
[SPEAKER_15]: It's coming out next week.

1045
01:30:16,292 --> 01:30:16,793
[SPEAKER_15]: The 29th.

1046
01:30:17,253 --> 01:30:19,215
[SPEAKER_18]: Just in time for the gift certificates and holiday returns.

1047
01:30:19,235 --> 01:30:20,235
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes, exactly.

1048
01:30:21,456 --> 01:30:23,038
[SPEAKER_15]: So, maybe I'll get that.

1049
01:30:23,098 --> 01:30:25,980
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm not a huge fighting game fan, but it looked good, so...

1050
01:30:27,003 --> 01:30:27,504
[SPEAKER_15]: I'll check it out.

1051
01:30:28,805 --> 01:30:32,568
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh no, there's really not too much I want.

1052
01:30:33,229 --> 01:30:38,574
[SPEAKER_15]: Just, I don't know, HGTV, I guess I could need one of those.

1053
01:30:38,634 --> 01:30:39,735
[SPEAKER_15]: I need to finish my cabinet.

1054
01:30:39,775 --> 01:30:42,257
[SPEAKER_15]: I need time to finish my cabinet.

1055
01:30:43,638 --> 01:30:44,699
[SPEAKER_15]: It's been a while.

1056
01:30:45,140 --> 01:30:46,140
[SPEAKER_15]: I need to finish it.

1057
01:30:47,101 --> 01:30:48,863
[SPEAKER_15]: Get the other controllers done.

1058
01:30:48,943 --> 01:30:53,287
[SPEAKER_15]: But I'm kind of holding back because I don't have any place to store them if I were to finish them.

1059
01:30:55,532 --> 01:30:56,473
[SPEAKER_15]: Storage is a big issue.

1060
01:30:58,034 --> 01:31:07,479
[SPEAKER_15]: Um, but as far as Christmas plans go, uh, playing a lot of Xbox Live, hopefully, because I did pay for a year of it, and I want to kind of get some use out of it.

1061
01:31:08,440 --> 01:31:18,086
[SPEAKER_15]: Um, and also, I'm supposed to go to my sister's house for Christmas, but she's local, so, um, that's pretty much it, though.

1062
01:31:18,326 --> 01:31:20,167
[SPEAKER_15]: It's just going to be pretty low-key.

1063
01:31:21,228 --> 01:31:21,888
[SPEAKER_15]: Ha ha, low-key.

1064
01:31:22,008 --> 01:31:22,709
[SPEAKER_15]: Ha ha, low-key.

1065
01:31:22,769 --> 01:31:23,189
[SPEAKER_15]: Ha ha ha.

1066
01:31:23,229 --> 01:31:23,429
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.

1067
01:31:26,061 --> 01:31:27,862
[SPEAKER_04]: Wait, wait, wait, wait.

1068
01:31:56,109 --> 01:31:57,110
[SPEAKER_18]: Let's see, what else do I want?

1069
01:31:57,370 --> 01:31:59,571
[SPEAKER_18]: I kind of want an Xbox 360, and I kind of don't.

1070
01:31:59,611 --> 01:32:02,333
[SPEAKER_18]: Like, you can wait, but if somebody wanted to give me one for Christmas, hey, I wouldn't mind.

1071
01:32:03,313 --> 01:32:11,158
[SPEAKER_18]: I'd get that other Xbox out of there, get the other Xbox in there, the 360, because it definitely is pretty, and I do happen to have an HDTV, so it looks very pretty.

1072
01:32:11,918 --> 01:32:13,899
[SPEAKER_18]: I already kind of bought myself an early Christmas present.

1073
01:32:13,919 --> 01:32:18,842
[SPEAKER_18]: I bought myself a new phone, because my old phone, this is what I did last weekend, since we kind of ended up not doing a show.

1074
01:32:19,823 --> 01:32:25,066
[SPEAKER_18]: I have a new phone here, and it actually takes video, which is an incredibly useless feature.

1075
01:32:25,806 --> 01:32:26,967
[SPEAKER_18]: and so on.

1076
01:32:55,886 --> 01:33:00,813
[SPEAKER_18]: She wants to see Brokeback Mountain, too, which I really want to see, of course, too.

1077
01:33:00,893 --> 01:33:03,036
[SPEAKER_18]: But I don't think that's going to be out here on Christmas.

1078
01:33:03,096 --> 01:33:04,538
[SPEAKER_18]: Isn't that a limited release thing?

1079
01:33:06,982 --> 01:33:10,526
[SPEAKER_18]: I think they're afraid of releasing it in the red states, so to speak, because I guess...

1080
01:33:12,569 --> 01:33:16,493
[SPEAKER_18]: People in red states, quote-unquote, can't appreciate a good gay cowboy movie.

1081
01:33:16,533 --> 01:33:20,276
[SPEAKER_18]: But I've read the book, and there's more to it than the gay cowboy thing.

1082
01:33:20,296 --> 01:33:21,857
[SPEAKER_18]: The media's really putting the spin on it.

1083
01:33:21,937 --> 01:33:25,080
[SPEAKER_18]: It's just like, oh my god, it's gay cowboys fucking.

1084
01:33:25,721 --> 01:33:28,603
[SPEAKER_18]: No, it's not gay cowboys fucking is not what the movie's about.

1085
01:33:28,923 --> 01:33:30,645
[SPEAKER_18]: It's a tale of forbidden love.

1086
01:33:31,225 --> 01:33:33,748
[SPEAKER_18]: Romeo and Juliet was a tale about forbidden love, okay?

1087
01:33:33,848 --> 01:33:36,290
[SPEAKER_18]: That is what the movie is really about.

1088
01:33:36,490 --> 01:33:37,151
[SPEAKER_18]: It's not about...

1089
01:33:38,243 --> 01:33:41,005
[SPEAKER_18]: Jake Gyllenhaal doing Heath Ledger in the booty hole.

1090
01:33:41,405 --> 01:33:43,167
[SPEAKER_18]: Although, that might be a plus.

1091
01:33:45,048 --> 01:33:49,291
[SPEAKER_18]: DarkSakura, what are your Christmas wishes and what do you have planned for this Christmas?

1092
01:33:49,732 --> 01:33:51,433
[SPEAKER_04]: I want a memory foam contour pillow.

1093
01:33:52,634 --> 01:33:53,655
[SPEAKER_04]: Or a Sobakawa pillow.

1094
01:33:54,455 --> 01:33:55,236
[SPEAKER_04]: Very, very much.

1095
01:33:56,617 --> 01:34:00,880
[SPEAKER_04]: And I don't really want any video game systems because I already own them all.

1096
01:34:02,501 --> 01:34:05,824
[SPEAKER_04]: I do want a copy of Emerald Dragon for the PC Engine.

1097
01:34:07,523 --> 01:34:08,564
[SPEAKER_04]: I've wanted that game for a while.

1098
01:34:09,744 --> 01:34:13,426
[SPEAKER_04]: And of course, Panorama Cotton for the Master System.

1099
01:34:14,087 --> 01:34:14,747
[SPEAKER_00]: Good luck.

1100
01:34:15,827 --> 01:34:18,129
[SPEAKER_04]: Someone must have tossed down $600 on me.

1101
01:34:18,189 --> 01:34:19,289
[SPEAKER_04]: I am not supposed to doubt.

1102
01:34:20,890 --> 01:34:22,231
[SPEAKER_04]: I also want a tapeworm.

1103
01:34:23,952 --> 01:34:26,433
[SPEAKER_04]: Like one that won't kill me, but that will eat all my extra food.

1104
01:34:27,614 --> 01:34:28,934
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd actually like my appetite back.

1105
01:34:29,595 --> 01:34:30,835
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'd like to be over the plague.

1106
01:34:32,016 --> 01:34:33,537
[SPEAKER_04]: And I want a hippopotamus for Christmas.

1107
01:34:35,249 --> 01:34:41,014
[SPEAKER_18]: I want a penguin for Christmas.

1108
01:34:41,094 --> 01:34:42,875
[SPEAKER_04]: I want a compound.

1109
01:34:44,857 --> 01:34:46,698
[SPEAKER_04]: So that we can hole up in it and drink red Kool-Aid.

1110
01:34:48,180 --> 01:34:48,720
[SPEAKER_17]: Sounds like fun.

1111
01:34:49,501 --> 01:34:49,901
[SPEAKER_04]: Lots of fun.

1112
01:34:50,942 --> 01:34:53,224
[SPEAKER_04]: And I need season 8 of Stargate box set.

1113
01:34:54,145 --> 01:34:54,645
[SPEAKER_04]: Very much so.

1114
01:34:55,746 --> 01:34:59,009
[SPEAKER_04]: And the Sony Ericsson Vodafone new one.

1115
01:34:59,770 --> 01:35:00,210
[SPEAKER_04]: I need that too.

1116
01:35:00,888 --> 01:35:05,810
[SPEAKER_18]: You know what movie, because you brought up a good point about hippopotamuses and the animals we want for Christmas.

1117
01:35:05,830 --> 01:35:09,872
[SPEAKER_18]: Do you know what movie I finally saw because nobody would go see it with me in the theater?

1118
01:35:09,952 --> 01:35:10,553
[SPEAKER_03]: Madagascar?

1119
01:35:10,753 --> 01:35:10,933
[SPEAKER_18]: No.

1120
01:35:11,673 --> 01:35:12,433
[SPEAKER_18]: March of the Penguins.

1121
01:35:13,014 --> 01:35:14,414
[SPEAKER_18]: I finally saw it on DVD.

1122
01:35:14,514 --> 01:35:16,675
[SPEAKER_18]: I want to see that.

1123
01:35:16,996 --> 01:35:18,997
[SPEAKER_18]: You know what the big surprise was about March of the Penguins?

1124
01:35:19,537 --> 01:35:19,937
[SPEAKER_18]: Boring.

1125
01:35:20,397 --> 01:35:21,078
[SPEAKER_18]: Fucking boring.

1126
01:35:21,558 --> 01:35:25,860
[SPEAKER_18]: I love penguins, love penguins, but the movie was very boring.

1127
01:35:26,380 --> 01:35:27,581
[SPEAKER_18]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1128
01:35:55,002 --> 01:35:58,843
[SPEAKER_04]: I want a coffee pot, like a nice one, that does lattes.

1129
01:36:01,804 --> 01:36:06,465
[SPEAKER_18]: Sort of like the big machines they have at Starbucks.

1130
01:36:07,265 --> 01:36:10,986
[SPEAKER_04]: And I want the Foamy The Squirrel DVDs, even though Foamy's voice gives me a headache.

1131
01:36:13,327 --> 01:36:15,147
[SPEAKER_04]: Because it's all about the guy that works at Starbucks.

1132
01:36:17,150 --> 01:36:18,811
[SPEAKER_18]: I didn't know they actually released that on DVD now.

1133
01:36:19,052 --> 01:36:20,733
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep, they're from the Squirrels DVDs.

1134
01:36:20,873 --> 01:36:23,735
[SPEAKER_04]: And actually I want the Squirrely Wrath t-shirt too.

1135
01:36:23,895 --> 01:36:25,256
[SPEAKER_18]: You know, we need to release the DVD.

1136
01:36:25,837 --> 01:36:26,377
[SPEAKER_04]: We sure do.

1137
01:36:27,318 --> 01:36:29,680
[SPEAKER_04]: And maybe that'll be an upcoming event for 2006.

1138
01:36:30,620 --> 01:36:31,021
[SPEAKER_18]: We'll see.

1139
01:36:31,461 --> 01:36:33,823
[SPEAKER_04]: Have our own best of DVD release.

1140
01:36:34,023 --> 01:36:34,383
[SPEAKER_18]: We'll see.

1141
01:36:34,443 --> 01:36:35,124
[SPEAKER_18]: We'll see what we can do.

1142
01:36:36,010 --> 01:36:38,811
[SPEAKER_18]: We've got a lot of stuff in store for 2006 here at Orange Launch Radio.

1143
01:36:39,051 --> 01:36:39,311
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1144
01:36:39,371 --> 01:36:40,171
[SPEAKER_18]: At least I think we do.

1145
01:36:40,291 --> 01:36:41,572
[SPEAKER_04]: Including me moving to Antarctica.

1146
01:36:41,592 --> 01:36:43,032
[SPEAKER_18]: You know the t-shirt thing is going to happen.

1147
01:36:43,052 --> 01:36:44,733
[SPEAKER_18]: I've got to talk to you guys about that after the show.

1148
01:36:44,773 --> 01:36:46,533
[SPEAKER_18]: But the t-shirts are happening, kids.

1149
01:36:46,573 --> 01:36:49,234
[SPEAKER_18]: There will be shirts very, very soon.

1150
01:36:49,294 --> 01:36:51,075
[SPEAKER_18]: Like January soon, we're hoping.

1151
01:36:51,115 --> 01:36:53,596
[SPEAKER_18]: If we get our logo done and everything, we're going to have shirts.

1152
01:36:53,776 --> 01:36:54,516
[SPEAKER_18]: It's very exciting.

1153
01:36:54,736 --> 01:36:58,037
[SPEAKER_18]: Because you guys have been begging us for shirts for a long time.

1154
01:36:58,477 --> 01:37:00,498
[SPEAKER_18]: So we're going to make that happen very soon.

1155
01:37:01,278 --> 01:37:02,639
[SPEAKER_18]: That's kind of our Christmas present to you.

1156
01:37:04,226 --> 01:37:06,227
[SPEAKER_04]: because we love our fans.

1157
01:37:06,587 --> 01:37:08,368
[SPEAKER_18]: In addition to doing this show all the time.

1158
01:37:11,029 --> 01:37:11,289
[SPEAKER_18]: All right.

1159
01:37:11,929 --> 01:37:15,690
[SPEAKER_18]: Anyway, well, it looks like we got past 8 o'clock and we're still going.

1160
01:37:16,011 --> 01:37:21,493
[SPEAKER_18]: So I'm thinking that means unless Live 365 is being slow, we are safe from getting dropped tonight.

1161
01:37:21,613 --> 01:37:22,233
[SPEAKER_18]: So that's good.

1162
01:37:22,673 --> 01:37:24,594
[SPEAKER_18]: Let's move on into the cage match, boys and girls.

1163
01:37:25,472 --> 01:37:29,613
[SPEAKER_18]: Let's do an Orange Lounge, good old-fashioned beat-down cage match type thing.

1164
01:37:32,074 --> 01:37:35,274
[SPEAKER_18]: Alright.

1165
01:37:35,634 --> 01:37:39,095
[SPEAKER_18]: The way the cage match works is we're going to play three songs for you guys.

1166
01:37:39,415 --> 01:37:48,518
[SPEAKER_18]: And you guys are going to pick your favorite, and the winning song goes into rotation all week long on Orange Lounge Radio's money, music, and video game music program.

1167
01:37:48,538 --> 01:37:50,298
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay, so you guys are just going to vote for your favorite.

1168
01:37:51,480 --> 01:37:58,210
[SPEAKER_18]: Two weeks ago, since we didn't do a show last week, we had this song win and it's actually a DDR artist who actually won the cage match.

1169
01:38:00,040 --> 01:38:01,300
[SPEAKER_18]: The artist's name is Tess.

1170
01:38:01,961 --> 01:38:07,202
[SPEAKER_18]: It's Tess and the song is called The Second You Sleep, I Stay To Watch You Fade Away.

1171
01:38:07,242 --> 01:38:08,903
[SPEAKER_18]: And we're going to go ahead and play this song for you guys.

1172
01:38:09,143 --> 01:38:12,944
[SPEAKER_18]: But you only get a clip because it actually already won a couple weeks ago.

1173
01:38:13,444 --> 01:38:14,585
[SPEAKER_18]: So you only get a clip of it.

1174
01:38:14,665 --> 01:38:18,846
[SPEAKER_18]: And it's going for a third week, second win tonight in the cage match.

1175
01:38:19,346 --> 01:38:21,607
[SPEAKER_18]: So enjoy or don't, it's your decision.

1176
01:38:21,727 --> 01:38:22,727
[SPEAKER_18]: But it is last week's winner.

1177
01:38:22,767 --> 01:38:25,268
[SPEAKER_18]: Here it is, song number one, Tess, The Second You Sleep.

1178
01:38:25,408 --> 01:38:25,588
[SPEAKER_18]: Enjoy.

1179
01:40:16,586 --> 01:40:20,751
I say to watch you fade away I dream of you tonight Tomorrow you'll be gone

1180
01:40:58,740 --> 01:41:00,501
[SPEAKER_18]: Wasn't that a great fade?

1181
01:41:00,601 --> 01:41:01,721
[SPEAKER_04]: You ruined it the internet, Rob.

1182
01:41:02,001 --> 01:41:05,883
[SPEAKER_18]: Song one there, Tess, I stay to watch you fade away.

1183
01:41:07,183 --> 01:41:11,625
[SPEAKER_18]: Will it stand the test of the battle of two other songs?

1184
01:41:11,685 --> 01:41:14,105
[SPEAKER_18]: I almost sounded like a Soul Calibur controller.

1185
01:41:14,205 --> 01:41:15,726
[SPEAKER_18]: Two other songs here tonight.

1186
01:41:16,146 --> 01:41:18,727
[SPEAKER_18]: Song number two is DarkSakura's pick.

1187
01:41:18,967 --> 01:41:20,948
[SPEAKER_18]: DarkSakura, what did you pick for our listeners tonight?

1188
01:41:22,270 --> 01:41:27,571
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a song I've been meaning to put in the cage for a while because we really, really need drum and bass represented.

1189
01:41:28,592 --> 01:41:34,873
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's one of my favorite DJs and one of my favorite singers, and it's actually one of my all-time favorite songs ever.

1190
01:41:35,693 --> 01:41:38,754
[SPEAKER_04]: It's DJ Crush and Estero with Final Home.

1191
01:41:40,015 --> 01:41:44,016
[SPEAKER_04]: I've played it on my show a couple times, so our listeners might find it familiar.

1192
01:41:44,136 --> 01:41:48,617
[SPEAKER_18]: DJ Crush with Estero, Final Home is song number two.

1193
01:41:48,737 --> 01:41:49,097
[SPEAKER_18]: Enjoy!

1194
01:44:18,309 --> 01:44:19,645
Thanks for watching!

1195
01:46:32,697 --> 01:46:37,640
[SPEAKER_18]: Song number two in tonight's cage match was DJ Crush featuring Astero with Final Home.

1196
01:46:38,020 --> 01:46:43,983
[SPEAKER_18]: Let's go around and see if that was judged as being a good song or a poopy song by our judges.

1197
01:46:44,343 --> 01:46:45,584
[SPEAKER_18]: Us, DarkSakura.

1198
01:46:45,924 --> 01:46:47,005
[SPEAKER_04]: That song is sexy.

1199
01:46:47,065 --> 01:46:47,685
[SPEAKER_04]: It gets a ten.

1200
01:46:48,906 --> 01:46:50,286
[SPEAKER_18]: A sexy ten from DarkSakura.

1201
01:46:50,346 --> 01:46:50,527
[SPEAKER_18]: Loki.

1202
01:46:50,607 --> 01:46:52,448
[SPEAKER_15]: It's not that sexy.

1203
01:46:52,508 --> 01:46:52,988
[SPEAKER_15]: It gets an eight.

1204
01:46:55,763 --> 01:46:58,144
[SPEAKER_18]: Not As Sexy 8 from Loki.

1205
01:46:59,804 --> 01:47:01,605
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't know if I would call that drum and bass.

1206
01:47:01,705 --> 01:47:04,086
[SPEAKER_18]: That's trip-hop before I would call it drum and bass.

1207
01:47:04,406 --> 01:47:06,427
[SPEAKER_04]: But DJ Crush is almost all drum and bass.

1208
01:47:06,827 --> 01:47:08,808
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, that's a little more trip-hop to me, but it doesn't matter.

1209
01:47:08,848 --> 01:47:09,448
[SPEAKER_18]: It doesn't really matter.

1210
01:47:09,568 --> 01:47:10,648
[SPEAKER_18]: Call it whatever the fuck you want.

1211
01:47:10,748 --> 01:47:11,629
[SPEAKER_18]: It's still a fine song.

1212
01:47:11,729 --> 01:47:12,129
[SPEAKER_18]: I like it.

1213
01:47:13,129 --> 01:47:16,771
[SPEAKER_18]: It's a song I could imagine myself having sex to, which is always a good thing, so I give it a 9.

1214
01:47:17,491 --> 01:47:17,891
[SPEAKER_18]: Very nice.

1215
01:47:18,631 --> 01:47:20,872
[SPEAKER_18]: Alright, let's get into song number 3 tonight.

1216
01:47:20,912 --> 01:47:21,952
[SPEAKER_18]: Loki picked song number 3.

1217
01:47:22,213 --> 01:47:23,113
[SPEAKER_18]: Loki, what'd you pick for us?

1218
01:47:24,850 --> 01:47:26,712
[SPEAKER_15]: I picked something completely last minute.

1219
01:47:26,812 --> 01:47:28,493
[SPEAKER_15]: I have not even listened to this yet.

1220
01:47:29,674 --> 01:47:32,416
[SPEAKER_18]: So this is a suicide pick from Loki, basically.

1221
01:47:32,476 --> 01:47:32,836
[SPEAKER_15]: I guess.

1222
01:47:33,176 --> 01:47:39,521
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, originally this week I had wanted to pick a remix of the Contra theme for some reason.

1223
01:47:39,641 --> 01:47:40,402
[SPEAKER_15]: And I don't know why.

1224
01:47:40,662 --> 01:47:42,504
[SPEAKER_15]: I did download something, but it was too long.

1225
01:47:42,924 --> 01:47:45,366
[SPEAKER_15]: It was like seven minutes long because it was kind of a medley.

1226
01:47:46,246 --> 01:47:48,088
[SPEAKER_15]: But this is another remix.

1227
01:47:48,108 --> 01:47:51,010
[SPEAKER_15]: This is actually from Contra Shattered Soldier.

1228
01:47:51,510 --> 01:47:53,652
[SPEAKER_15]: And the remix is called Spread Your Fire Against.

1229
01:47:55,051 --> 01:47:58,414
[SPEAKER_18]: At first I thought this song was called Spread Your Legs, because I just saw the spread your.

1230
01:47:58,894 --> 01:48:00,255
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh yeah, Spread Your Fire Against Me.

1231
01:48:00,335 --> 01:48:01,817
[SPEAKER_18]: It's by Brain Cells and Dennis.

1232
01:48:02,517 --> 01:48:05,400
[SPEAKER_18]: It's song number three, and Loki better hope it's good, or else he's going to look like an ass.

1233
01:48:05,680 --> 01:48:06,841
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't care.

1234
01:48:07,221 --> 01:48:07,781
[SPEAKER_18]: Alright, here it is.

1235
01:48:07,822 --> 01:48:08,102
[SPEAKER_18]: Enjoy.

1236
01:48:44,302 --> 01:48:45,383
Thank you for watching!

1237
01:49:04,874 --> 01:49:14,939
[SPEAKER_09]: I hope that you live and there's no use to me And I know you're trying to steal your mind off of the TV

1238
01:49:46,438 --> 01:49:47,280
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks for watching!

1239
01:50:01,265 --> 01:50:13,610
[SPEAKER_09]: We will try to verify why he's holding on There's no use in falling out, wasting our precious time They won't learn from their mistakes, so you need that to die

1240
01:50:37,094 --> 01:50:39,676
I was left in prison asking every threat to resign Die Die

1241
01:51:21,665 --> 01:51:29,576
A dreaded total fighter With a fucking US Army I'll look inside till you have enough Kill them all with no remorse, no!

1242
01:51:48,058 --> 01:51:49,262
Thank you for watching!

1243
01:52:08,294 --> 01:52:09,195
[SPEAKER_18]: Song number three.

1244
01:52:09,295 --> 01:52:10,155
[SPEAKER_18]: God, I love that challenge.

1245
01:52:10,175 --> 01:52:18,280
[SPEAKER_18]: Song number three, Brain Cells and Dennis with Spread Your Fire Against Me, which apparently is a remix from Contra's Shattered Soldier.

1246
01:52:18,300 --> 01:52:18,640
[SPEAKER_18]: Who knew?

1247
01:52:19,340 --> 01:52:19,760
[SPEAKER_18]: Let's see.

1248
01:52:19,861 --> 01:52:23,022
[SPEAKER_18]: Does that make you want to spread your fire or spread your hate?

1249
01:52:23,082 --> 01:52:23,423
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't know.

1250
01:52:23,923 --> 01:52:25,043
[SPEAKER_18]: DarkSakura, what did you think?

1251
01:52:25,184 --> 01:52:28,886
[SPEAKER_04]: It makes me feel like I should worship Satan or something.

1252
01:52:29,666 --> 01:52:30,787
[SPEAKER_04]: So it gets a minus 666.

1253
01:52:30,827 --> 01:52:31,027
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki.

1254
01:52:31,067 --> 01:52:31,407
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki.

1255
01:52:34,355 --> 01:52:37,397
[SPEAKER_15]: It gets a positive 666 to counteract the minus 666.

1256
01:52:37,637 --> 01:52:39,059
[SPEAKER_04]: So it effectively has a zero?

1257
01:52:39,599 --> 01:52:39,879
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes!

1258
01:52:40,379 --> 01:52:41,180
[SPEAKER_18]: Good thinking, Loki.

1259
01:52:41,360 --> 01:52:42,921
[SPEAKER_18]: Good thinking.

1260
01:52:43,442 --> 01:52:45,904
[SPEAKER_18]: That song does make me want to smoke crack and worship Satan.

1261
01:52:46,644 --> 01:52:50,287
[SPEAKER_18]: But, you know, actually it kind of reminded me of Gwar a little bit.

1262
01:52:50,647 --> 01:52:51,408
[SPEAKER_18]: And I started thinking about...

1263
01:52:52,588 --> 01:53:10,319
[SPEAKER_18]: I know Gwar is a lot cooler, but then I just imagine these giant outfits, because the thing I love about Gwar, like, fuck the music with Gwar, but just them getting up in those giant costumes and thrashing about, where they all look like Shao Kahn from Mortal Kombat, and they're on stage thrashing about, is really badass.

1264
01:53:10,539 --> 01:53:13,381
[SPEAKER_18]: And so I kind of thought about that, and that made me giggle a lot.

1265
01:53:13,441 --> 01:53:18,184
[SPEAKER_18]: So that song gets like a five for the number of times I laughed.

1266
01:53:19,318 --> 01:53:21,580
[SPEAKER_18]: Alright, but it's not up to us.

1267
01:53:22,020 --> 01:53:23,201
[SPEAKER_18]: We are not the final judges.

1268
01:53:23,301 --> 01:53:23,742
[SPEAKER_18]: You are.

1269
01:53:24,102 --> 01:53:26,904
[SPEAKER_18]: You kids that listen to this program out there and are in our chat room right now.

1270
01:53:26,944 --> 01:53:27,865
[SPEAKER_18]: You are the final say.

1271
01:53:28,265 --> 01:53:30,707
[SPEAKER_18]: So let's see the three songs you get to vote for tonight.

1272
01:53:31,107 --> 01:53:36,492
[SPEAKER_18]: Song number one, as a reminder, is Tess with The Second You Sleep, I Stay To Watch You Fade Away.

1273
01:53:43,474 --> 01:53:51,383
[SPEAKER_18]: And song number two you can vote for tonight is DJ Crush and Astero with a song called Final Home.

1274
01:53:58,371 --> 01:54:03,958
[SPEAKER_18]: And song number three you can vote for tonight is Brain Cells and Dennis with Spread Your Fire Against Me.

1275
01:54:11,744 --> 01:54:12,164
[SPEAKER_18]: It's a good time.

1276
01:54:12,184 --> 01:54:12,764
[SPEAKER_18]: I like it.

1277
01:54:12,784 --> 01:54:13,845
[SPEAKER_18]: I hope it does well.

1278
01:54:13,865 --> 01:54:14,125
[SPEAKER_18]: We'll see.

1279
01:54:14,145 --> 01:54:15,145
[SPEAKER_18]: It's up to the chat room.

1280
01:54:15,165 --> 01:54:16,325
[SPEAKER_18]: So send in your votes now.

1281
01:54:42,386 --> 01:54:46,128
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, it looks like we didn't get the plug pulled on us, so we get to continue to do a show here.

1282
01:54:46,168 --> 01:54:47,389
[SPEAKER_18]: How's OLR Town going?

1283
01:54:47,409 --> 01:54:50,511
[SPEAKER_18]: Did you finally just close the gate and say, fuck you all, and now you and Jamie are playing?

1284
01:54:51,051 --> 01:54:53,072
[SPEAKER_15]: No, but Harold's been the only one that's joined.

1285
01:54:53,413 --> 01:54:58,696
[SPEAKER_15]: So I am taking this time to write OLR message in a bottle spam.

1286
01:54:58,776 --> 01:54:59,436
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh, propaganda.

1287
01:54:59,696 --> 01:55:00,217
[SPEAKER_15]: Propaganda, yes.

1288
01:55:00,237 --> 01:55:01,157
[SPEAKER_18]: Good, good thinking.

1289
01:55:01,398 --> 01:55:02,078
[SPEAKER_13]: That was my idea.

1290
01:55:03,699 --> 01:55:04,139
[SPEAKER_18]: No, what is this?

1291
01:55:04,159 --> 01:55:09,182
[SPEAKER_18]: You guys are going to spam Orange Lounge Radio across Animal Crossing World by what?

1292
01:55:09,262 --> 01:55:09,723
[SPEAKER_18]: Using a bottle?

1293
01:55:09,743 --> 01:55:10,323
[SPEAKER_18]: How does this work?

1294
01:55:10,635 --> 01:55:14,678
[SPEAKER_04]: The message in the bottle, you basically write whatever you want, put it in the bottle and drop it in the ocean.

1295
01:55:14,759 --> 01:55:21,464
[SPEAKER_18]: Message in a bottle, message... Penfold.

1296
01:55:22,105 --> 01:55:22,465
[SPEAKER_04]: Shush.

1297
01:55:23,786 --> 01:55:31,252
[SPEAKER_04]: No, um... It's like supposed to go to somebody else's random village, so they'll get... You should listen to Orange Dawn Radio because we said so.

1298
01:55:32,854 --> 01:55:33,234
[SPEAKER_18]: Very cool.

1299
01:55:34,035 --> 01:55:34,775
[SPEAKER_18]: We'll see if it works.

1300
01:55:36,517 --> 01:55:37,298
[SPEAKER_18]: Alright, um...

1301
01:55:38,760 --> 01:55:44,225
[SPEAKER_18]: Loki, after the cage match is usually where I go over to you and I say, Hey Loki, what's going on in the sim scene?

1302
01:55:44,285 --> 01:55:49,330
[SPEAKER_18]: And you usually will say nothing, but I thought I would humor this tonight and see what's going on.

1303
01:55:50,270 --> 01:55:51,592
[SPEAKER_15]: More sim file contests.

1304
01:55:51,732 --> 01:55:57,777
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm actually, Stepmania is doing one, their official sim file contest through stepmania.com.

1305
01:55:58,137 --> 01:55:58,798
[SPEAKER_15]: So that's interesting.

1306
01:55:58,818 --> 01:56:02,962
[SPEAKER_18]: Are they encouraging people to use their own MP3s, or encouraging people to use commercial MP3s for this?

1307
01:56:02,982 --> 01:56:03,302
[SPEAKER_15]: No, they're...

1308
01:56:04,443 --> 01:56:11,745
[SPEAKER_15]: They're encouraging people to use royalty-free MP3s or MP3s that they have the permission of the artist to use.

1309
01:56:12,485 --> 01:56:14,965
[SPEAKER_18]: So in other words, they will be forced to come up with something original.

1310
01:56:15,545 --> 01:56:16,385
[SPEAKER_15]: Something original.

1311
01:56:16,606 --> 01:56:17,146
[SPEAKER_15]: I like this.

1312
01:56:18,226 --> 01:56:20,226
[SPEAKER_15]: And then, so there's a contest going on there.

1313
01:56:20,746 --> 01:56:23,727
[SPEAKER_15]: And then I think OSC4 was just finishing up.

1314
01:56:25,467 --> 01:56:26,087
[SPEAKER_15]: And that's about it.

1315
01:56:27,908 --> 01:56:32,229
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, and Siberia Style 3 has been released.

1316
01:56:32,589 --> 01:56:33,589
[SPEAKER_15]: The Stepmania theme.

1317
01:56:35,618 --> 01:56:36,138
[SPEAKER_15]: Thanks for watching!

1318
01:56:50,677 --> 01:56:51,017
[SPEAKER_15]: That's it.

1319
01:56:51,217 --> 01:56:52,498
[SPEAKER_15]: That's all that's going on in the world.

1320
01:56:52,518 --> 01:56:56,961
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, tell me about something going on in the hack and crack world, because we've got to fill time here while we get cage match votes, Tally.

1321
01:56:57,662 --> 01:57:01,224
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, apparently... Last call for cage match votes, by the way.

1322
01:57:01,244 --> 01:57:11,572
[SPEAKER_15]: Homebrew stuff, they've gotten it to run now through version 2.5 and 2.6, using the same workaround that they've used to create that trainer for Grand Theft Auto.

1323
01:57:12,092 --> 01:57:18,817
[SPEAKER_15]: And so they're actually using that to port Homebrew to the PSP on firmwares 2.5 and 2.6.

1324
01:57:20,785 --> 01:57:26,869
[SPEAKER_15]: So what that means is probably there'll be another firmware coming out for the PSP to break all that stuff.

1325
01:57:28,270 --> 01:57:36,095
[SPEAKER_15]: And then what'll happen is they'll come out with something else to break that and the cycle keeps going on and on.

1326
01:57:37,716 --> 01:57:45,401
[SPEAKER_15]: And other things, there's actually been some pretty cool stuff for like the 360 being put on Xbox Live.

1327
01:57:46,222 --> 01:57:50,305
[SPEAKER_15]: One of them being more downloadable cars for Ridge Racer 6, which makes me happy.

1328
01:57:50,825 --> 01:57:51,545
[SPEAKER_15]: And those are free.

1329
01:57:52,506 --> 01:57:55,227
[SPEAKER_15]: They've also added some music from the other games.

1330
01:57:55,387 --> 01:58:00,228
[SPEAKER_15]: I saw some stuff, Warp Rider and stuff from I think Ridge Racer for the PSP.

1331
01:58:00,608 --> 01:58:02,289
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm sure that was in other ones as well.

1332
01:58:02,829 --> 01:58:04,990
[SPEAKER_15]: But there's a lot of music in Ridge Racer.

1333
01:58:05,010 --> 01:58:08,851
[SPEAKER_15]: There's like four virtual CDs worth of music on there.

1334
01:58:09,752 --> 01:58:11,052
[SPEAKER_15]: Just really good stuff.

1335
01:58:12,449 --> 01:58:12,529
[SPEAKER_18]: XBOX360

1336
01:58:31,986 --> 01:58:32,627
[SPEAKER_15]: It is pretty cool.

1337
01:58:33,767 --> 01:58:34,068
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't know.

1338
01:58:35,148 --> 01:58:35,969
[SPEAKER_15]: Cameo's pretty fun.

1339
01:58:36,169 --> 01:58:37,150
[SPEAKER_15]: I've been playing that a little bit.

1340
01:58:37,330 --> 01:58:37,530
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah?

1341
01:58:37,870 --> 01:58:38,691
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, it's pretty cool.

1342
01:58:39,892 --> 01:58:41,213
[SPEAKER_15]: I am kind of digging it a bit.

1343
01:58:42,334 --> 01:58:44,355
[SPEAKER_15]: It's a little easy, though.

1344
01:58:44,695 --> 01:58:45,496
[SPEAKER_15]: That's what I've found.

1345
01:58:46,056 --> 01:58:48,058
[SPEAKER_15]: But I'm sure it gets a lot harder throughout the game.

1346
01:58:48,558 --> 01:58:49,158
[SPEAKER_15]: It's still pretty.

1347
01:58:51,640 --> 01:58:53,261
[SPEAKER_15]: And then Ridge Racer is really fun.

1348
01:58:53,401 --> 01:58:54,442
[SPEAKER_15]: I like that game a lot.

1349
01:58:54,782 --> 01:58:58,165
[SPEAKER_15]: And Call of Duty 2, the multiplayer, is really fun in that

1350
01:58:58,953 --> 01:59:01,134
[SPEAKER_15]: Just, I like the multiplayer a lot in my game.

1351
01:59:04,796 --> 01:59:07,838
[SPEAKER_15]: And, I don't know, just overall pretty fun.

1352
01:59:08,138 --> 01:59:10,479
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm thinking about maybe picking up another game here.

1353
01:59:11,620 --> 01:59:13,321
[SPEAKER_15]: Not sure what I want to pick up, though.

1354
01:59:13,961 --> 01:59:15,762
[SPEAKER_15]: Maybe Need for Speed.

1355
01:59:17,843 --> 01:59:21,805
[SPEAKER_15]: Definitely going to get Dead or Alive 4 when that comes out.

1356
01:59:23,006 --> 01:59:24,166
[SPEAKER_15]: Been actually pretty excited.

1357
01:59:24,487 --> 01:59:26,308
[SPEAKER_15]: They've been showing some pictures for...

1358
01:59:28,075 --> 01:59:28,976
[SPEAKER_15]: Blow up everything!

1359
01:59:29,016 --> 01:59:30,836
[SPEAKER_15]: They sort of had a commercial like that for Mercenaries

1360
01:59:56,198 --> 02:00:11,464
[SPEAKER_15]: Um, Mercenaries, when it came out, um, on the PlayStation 2 and Xbox, you know, I was the commercial, blow up buildings, blow them up again, you know, blow up tanks, fire rockets, you know, it was just the whole commercial dedicated to that, and it was great.

1361
02:00:12,364 --> 02:00:14,245
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a great idea.

1362
02:00:15,946 --> 02:00:18,707
[SPEAKER_15]: It's a lot better than those commercials that they have at the PSP.

1363
02:00:19,227 --> 02:00:24,609
[SPEAKER_15]: It's like a nut you can play with outside, or it's like carpet you can watch outside.

1364
02:00:25,256 --> 02:00:27,078
[SPEAKER_18]: It's like carpet you can munch outside.

1365
02:00:27,358 --> 02:00:31,301
[SPEAKER_18]: No, well they have, like, they're talking about the PSP and being able to play it outside.

1366
02:00:31,441 --> 02:00:33,523
[SPEAKER_18]: Have you ever tried to play PSP outside?

1367
02:00:33,803 --> 02:00:36,485
[SPEAKER_18]: You can't see shit on the screen outside.

1368
02:00:36,505 --> 02:00:38,487
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, to be fair, it goes for most systems.

1369
02:00:38,627 --> 02:00:39,567
[SPEAKER_18]: You can't really see the DS outside.

1370
02:00:39,587 --> 02:00:42,910
[SPEAKER_15]: Exactly, but why are they trying to push it that you can play it outside?

1371
02:00:42,950 --> 02:00:45,132
[SPEAKER_18]: Which is why I never fucking understood.

1372
02:00:45,232 --> 02:00:45,752
[SPEAKER_04]: Only at night.

1373
02:00:45,872 --> 02:00:49,075
[SPEAKER_18]: What was that fucking game on Game Boy Advance that was the sun?

1374
02:00:49,155 --> 02:00:50,836
[SPEAKER_18]: It was Konami, and you had to do the sun.

1375
02:00:51,197 --> 02:00:52,358
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, I know what you're talking about.

1376
02:00:52,438 --> 02:00:53,278
[SPEAKER_18]: Is that what it's called?

1377
02:00:53,298 --> 02:00:53,639
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, yeah.

1378
02:00:54,079 --> 02:00:54,780
[SPEAKER_18]: Fuck that game.

1379
02:00:55,040 --> 02:00:56,302
[SPEAKER_18]: I mean, seriously, fuck it.

1380
02:00:56,422 --> 02:00:56,842
[SPEAKER_18]: And it's here.

1381
02:00:57,223 --> 02:00:59,846
[SPEAKER_18]: That was so stupid, that sun thing encouraging me to go outside.

1382
02:01:00,146 --> 02:01:01,608
[SPEAKER_18]: I can't see my game when I go outside.

1383
02:01:03,010 --> 02:01:08,256
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, actually, that's the way you had to play it for those old systems that didn't have backlights, though.

1384
02:01:08,917 --> 02:01:09,718
[SPEAKER_18]: The ones that do, though.

1385
02:01:10,018 --> 02:01:10,719
[SPEAKER_18]: You can't see them now.

1386
02:01:12,799 --> 02:01:15,001
[SPEAKER_18]: The Chat Room requested some more happy.

1387
02:01:33,374 --> 02:01:36,738
[SPEAKER_18]: So we have nothing but nauseously happy songs this break.

1388
02:01:37,158 --> 02:01:39,341
[SPEAKER_18]: And for some reason I don't have Jenny Rahm in here, though.

1389
02:01:39,381 --> 02:01:40,082
[SPEAKER_18]: I may have to fix that.

1390
02:01:40,102 --> 02:01:40,422
[SPEAKER_18]: We'll see.

1391
02:01:41,183 --> 02:01:47,270
[SPEAKER_18]: But I thought of something better than Jenny Rahm, and we're going to start it off with that really, like, annoyingly happy song from In the Groove.

1392
02:01:47,490 --> 02:01:50,934
[SPEAKER_18]: So we're going to start off with that, and we'll be back with more Orange Andreo after this.

1393
02:05:30,430 --> 02:05:31,211
DarkSakura.com

1394
02:05:58,568 --> 02:06:03,132
[SPEAKER_09]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1395
02:06:41,207 --> 02:06:42,228
We've got a winner!

1396
02:07:10,641 --> 02:07:11,363
Thanks for watching!

1397
02:09:10,552 --> 02:09:16,199
[SPEAKER_03]: Mr. Random Person on the Street, who, by the way, is not an actor, what do you think of the Orange Lounge mainlining music in Moore's show?

1398
02:09:16,499 --> 02:09:23,427
[SPEAKER_14]: The music is like being transported to just this dancing spaceship place.

1399
02:09:23,767 --> 02:09:23,867
[SPEAKER_14]: It's...

1400
02:09:25,279 --> 02:09:25,720
[SPEAKER_14]: on Earthly.

1401
02:09:25,960 --> 02:09:29,683
[SPEAKER_14]: It's like being at a club, except you don't have to actually ask someone to dance.

1402
02:09:42,250 --> 02:09:42,810
[SPEAKER_18]: Lucha Libre on Telemundo!

1403
02:10:08,070 --> 02:10:09,751
[SPEAKER_18]: Telemundo, Telemundo, Telemundo!

1404
02:10:10,191 --> 02:10:13,093
[SPEAKER_18]: I love that stuff, and they have the best talk shows.

1405
02:10:13,473 --> 02:10:17,575
[SPEAKER_18]: Sure, I can't understand half the shit they're saying, but I can pick up enough words so I kinda know what's going on.

1406
02:10:20,197 --> 02:10:21,758
[SPEAKER_03]: I do love Mexican wrestling.

1407
02:10:26,340 --> 02:10:27,561
[SPEAKER_18]: La lucha libre!

1408
02:10:27,821 --> 02:10:29,662
[SPEAKER_18]: No, anyway, forget it.

1409
02:10:31,023 --> 02:10:32,784
[SPEAKER_18]: So, yeah, anyway, hi.

1410
02:10:34,522 --> 02:10:35,602
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't know where that came from.

1411
02:10:36,123 --> 02:10:42,686
[SPEAKER_18]: Anyway, we decided that since we did do a happy, happy bouncy break, that we will actually do a very dark, depressing break next.

1412
02:10:42,986 --> 02:10:43,706
[SPEAKER_18]: So that'll be fun.

1413
02:10:43,726 --> 02:10:46,007
[SPEAKER_18]: We're going to do our emo break next.

1414
02:10:46,147 --> 02:10:47,048
[SPEAKER_18]: So that'll be fun.

1415
02:10:47,088 --> 02:10:49,489
[SPEAKER_18]: We can kind of offset that a little bit there.

1416
02:10:51,852 --> 02:11:05,343
[SPEAKER_18]: Anyway, now they're having a discussion here in the chat room talking about Sirius versus XM, which are the dueling satellite radios here.

1417
02:11:05,683 --> 02:11:07,945
[SPEAKER_18]: Now, have you guys ever looked into getting satellite radio?

1418
02:11:08,946 --> 02:11:11,888
[SPEAKER_04]: My new stereo is XM compatible, but I haven't.

1419
02:11:13,339 --> 02:11:15,080
[SPEAKER_18]: You know that's funny because mine is Sirius compatible.

1420
02:11:15,180 --> 02:11:17,542
[SPEAKER_18]: And I'm in the same boat where I haven't really decided to get that.

1421
02:11:17,982 --> 02:11:19,923
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm tempted though with the Stern thing.

1422
02:11:20,003 --> 02:11:24,687
[SPEAKER_18]: Not that I'm a huge Howard Stern fan, but I think he's interesting.

1423
02:11:24,747 --> 02:11:27,949
[SPEAKER_18]: And I'd be interested to hear what he has to say on the new show.

1424
02:11:27,989 --> 02:11:29,630
[SPEAKER_18]: But I'm sure it'll be all over the internet and stuff.

1425
02:11:30,090 --> 02:11:32,132
[SPEAKER_18]: So I've been tempted to get Sirius.

1426
02:11:32,472 --> 02:11:35,614
[SPEAKER_18]: But DarkSakura says that we should get on satellite radio.

1427
02:11:35,654 --> 02:11:36,554
[SPEAKER_18]: And I tend to agree.

1428
02:11:36,835 --> 02:11:37,955
[SPEAKER_18]: We should be on satellite radio.

1429
02:11:38,276 --> 02:11:41,218
[SPEAKER_18]: But you know Adam Curry has a show on, I think it's Sirius.

1430
02:11:41,458 --> 02:11:43,039
[SPEAKER_18]: And he does a show about podcasting.

1431
02:11:44,960 --> 02:11:47,421
[SPEAKER_18]: and I think he plays clips from different podcasts.

1432
02:11:48,301 --> 02:11:53,103
[SPEAKER_18]: And I've actually submitted our show, I don't know, months ago, I submitted that little promo we did to the show.

1433
02:11:53,143 --> 02:11:53,983
[SPEAKER_18]: I've never heard back.

1434
02:11:54,323 --> 02:12:01,266
[SPEAKER_18]: So, you know, the best way that you could hear us on one of these stations would be to email the fuck out of these people and say, hey, have you heard of Orange Orange Radio?

1435
02:12:01,286 --> 02:12:02,206
[SPEAKER_18]: You should include them.

1436
02:12:02,326 --> 02:12:03,947
[SPEAKER_04]: Syndicate, syndicate.

1437
02:12:04,207 --> 02:12:08,949
[SPEAKER_18]: And it's tough, too, because when we first started our podcast, there was...

1438
02:12:09,742 --> 02:12:36,754
[SPEAKER_18]: very few other gaming podcasts out there only a few people have jumped on the bandwagon early and very very few of them are still around I can only think of like I think maybe two other podcasts I can think of that have been around just as long if not longer than we are that are still going regularly a lot of them kind of tapered off but now there are literally like at least a hundred video game podcasts out there on the internet right now so it's tough for us to stand out from the rest you know it's getting pretty competitive out there

1439
02:12:37,054 --> 02:12:37,915
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for watching!

1440
02:12:52,887 --> 02:12:53,808
[SPEAKER_18]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1441
02:13:23,673 --> 02:13:25,674
[SPEAKER_18]: We won that little thing, and that was nice.

1442
02:13:26,135 --> 02:13:27,616
[SPEAKER_18]: And that was strictly because of our fans.

1443
02:13:29,137 --> 02:13:31,139
[SPEAKER_18]: But we just want to have fun with this.

1444
02:13:32,780 --> 02:13:35,562
[SPEAKER_18]: And we want to bring more people, because we're a very interactive show.

1445
02:13:35,842 --> 02:13:40,446
[SPEAKER_18]: We like to think that's one thing that maybe sets ourselves apart from the others, is that we're a very interactive show.

1446
02:13:41,567 --> 02:13:43,148
[SPEAKER_18]: Anyway, something to think about.

1447
02:13:44,349 --> 02:13:46,831
[SPEAKER_18]: Shall we hear who won tonight's cage match, boys and girls?

1448
02:13:47,051 --> 02:13:48,352
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, let's!

1449
02:13:48,693 --> 02:13:52,396
[SPEAKER_18]: The winner of tonight's cage match was...

1450
02:13:55,109 --> 02:13:56,589
[SPEAKER_18]: Tess, once again.

1451
02:13:59,230 --> 02:14:02,551
[SPEAKER_18]: Because everybody loves some generic trance in their life.

1452
02:14:03,331 --> 02:14:04,091
[SPEAKER_18]: Enjoy that, Tess.

1453
02:14:04,171 --> 02:14:05,452
[SPEAKER_18]: Actually, I like that song an awful lot.

1454
02:14:05,652 --> 02:14:06,432
[SPEAKER_18]: Can't say a lot negative.

1455
02:14:06,752 --> 02:14:08,592
[SPEAKER_18]: Although I was very disappointed at the voting turnout.

1456
02:14:08,692 --> 02:14:09,533
[SPEAKER_18]: Very few votes.

1457
02:14:09,553 --> 02:14:13,734
[SPEAKER_18]: This is the lowest voting turnout I've seen since Election Day.

1458
02:14:13,754 --> 02:14:16,414
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay, so more voting people.

1459
02:14:16,474 --> 02:14:17,535
[SPEAKER_18]: Shame, shame, shame.

1460
02:14:17,575 --> 02:14:18,195
[SPEAKER_18]: Get the word out there.

1461
02:14:19,252 --> 02:14:19,532
[SPEAKER_18]: All right.

1462
02:14:21,353 --> 02:14:21,933
[SPEAKER_18]: Let's see.

1463
02:14:23,334 --> 02:14:26,115
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm trying to go to our chat room there, www.orangemonster.com.

1464
02:14:26,135 --> 02:14:29,736
[SPEAKER_18]: They're talking about... In the chat room there.

1465
02:14:30,537 --> 02:14:31,077
[SPEAKER_18]: They're talking...

1466
02:14:32,725 --> 02:14:36,669
[SPEAKER_18]: They're talking about, um, why are they talking about Don and Drew?

1467
02:14:37,229 --> 02:14:42,073
[SPEAKER_18]: That podcast, that's a very, oh, maybe they're trying to talk about podcasts that have been around.

1468
02:14:42,113 --> 02:14:44,376
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm talking about strictly video game podcasts.

1469
02:14:44,396 --> 02:14:47,478
[SPEAKER_18]: I know Don and Drew have been around since, like, podcasting started.

1470
02:14:47,498 --> 02:14:53,704
[SPEAKER_18]: That they were the first, like, big name couple that got on the, you know, the iPod thing and started talking about their sex life or whatever it is they do.

1471
02:14:53,744 --> 02:14:54,925
[SPEAKER_18]: I've only listened to a little bit of the show.

1472
02:14:55,285 --> 02:14:57,768
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm going to be honest, kids, I don't listen to a lot of podcasts.

1473
02:14:58,729 --> 02:15:00,450
[SPEAKER_18]: I totally support podcasting.

1474
02:15:00,490 --> 02:15:04,113
[SPEAKER_18]: I think podcasting is truly the wave of the future and I support it.

1475
02:15:04,173 --> 02:15:09,678
[SPEAKER_18]: But as somebody who's trying to put together an original podcast, I don't really listen to a lot of others.

1476
02:15:10,038 --> 02:15:14,101
[SPEAKER_18]: Which is a little bit of a controversial standpoint because you think I could stand to learn things by listening to other podcasts.

1477
02:15:14,121 --> 02:15:17,744
[SPEAKER_18]: At the same time, I want to make sure our show is purely original.

1478
02:15:18,004 --> 02:15:21,467
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, Yanni doesn't listen to anybody else so that all of his music is original.

1479
02:15:22,248 --> 02:15:23,169
[SPEAKER_18]: But Yanni sucks.

1480
02:15:24,489 --> 02:15:40,318
[SPEAKER_18]: Not really, I like some of Yanni's music If you're into, you know, screaming opera pigs No, I'm kidding Yanni's good if you like that kind of music So what are you saying, we're the Yanni of podcasting?

1481
02:15:40,898 --> 02:15:52,024
[SPEAKER_18]: Only cooler Alright, anyway I'm feeling a little angsty So I think it's time to get into the FUs of the week What do you kids think?

1482
02:15:54,232 --> 02:15:55,113
[SPEAKER_18]: You want to do some angst?

1483
02:15:56,313 --> 02:15:57,314
[SPEAKER_04]: Angst up, yo.

1484
02:15:57,334 --> 02:15:58,575
[SPEAKER_18]: Alright, let's do some angst here.

1485
02:15:59,636 --> 02:16:02,177
[SPEAKER_18]: DarkSakura, of course, you know I'm always going to go over and start with you.

1486
02:16:02,237 --> 02:16:04,959
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh, by the way, guys, you can submit your FUs of the week right now.

1487
02:16:05,319 --> 02:16:13,484
[SPEAKER_18]: Go to www.orangemonstrator.com and click on chat and send a private message to Sky with your FU of the week, if you have an FU of the week.

1488
02:16:13,765 --> 02:16:16,787
[SPEAKER_18]: But you know we've got to get ours out first because we are some angsty motherfuckers.

1489
02:16:17,147 --> 02:16:20,909
[SPEAKER_18]: So, DarkSakura, why is it we do the FUs of the week every single week?

1490
02:16:21,109 --> 02:16:22,070
[SPEAKER_18]: Grr, argh.

1491
02:16:35,757 --> 02:16:39,259
[SPEAKER_04]: F you to, uh, the abundant amounts of rain.

1492
02:16:40,640 --> 02:16:47,543
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, because, uh, you know, it just makes it really hard to drive when everybody else on the road is being a big dipshit.

1493
02:16:48,404 --> 02:16:51,706
[SPEAKER_04]: Which is the case, I've passed something like three accidents on the way here today.

1494
02:16:52,826 --> 02:16:58,209
[SPEAKER_04]: Another F you goes, of course, to the plague for not releasing me from its evil grip lately.

1495
02:16:59,270 --> 02:16:59,350
[SPEAKER_04]: Um...

1496
02:17:00,945 --> 02:17:06,648
[SPEAKER_04]: Another one goes toward my utter lack of appetite from being sick because I've dropped 15 pounds in a month and a half.

1497
02:17:07,189 --> 02:17:10,591
[SPEAKER_04]: So like none of my clothes fit me anymore and I can't really afford to go buy new ones right now.

1498
02:17:12,092 --> 02:17:26,080
[SPEAKER_04]: FU to the rock that flew off of the road and landed in my windshield and then cracked two days later so that now I have a big split across the lower half of my windshield from one end to the other and have to pay to have my windshield replaced.

1499
02:17:28,143 --> 02:17:31,687
[SPEAKER_04]: So, uh, that really, uh, sort of hacks me off.

1500
02:17:32,087 --> 02:17:36,592
[SPEAKER_04]: And, uh, an FU goes to the general stupidity on the internet.

1501
02:17:37,072 --> 02:17:38,494
[SPEAKER_04]: But that's the expected.

1502
02:17:39,074 --> 02:17:39,935
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, I'm done.

1503
02:17:40,496 --> 02:17:41,276
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yeah, one more.

1504
02:17:41,917 --> 02:17:44,340
[SPEAKER_04]: All those people who misuse the apostrophe.

1505
02:17:44,360 --> 02:17:45,741
[SPEAKER_04]: Fuck y'all.

1506
02:17:46,842 --> 02:17:47,102
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm done.

1507
02:17:48,103 --> 02:17:50,406
[SPEAKER_18]: Loki, what FUs do you have for us tonight?

1508
02:17:52,359 --> 02:17:54,900
[SPEAKER_18]: I'd like to second the stupid driver FU.

1509
02:17:55,020 --> 02:18:07,964
[SPEAKER_18]: I keep seeing, you know, this torrential rain coming down and people driving with their headlights off still or in the fog and they're driving extremely fast in the fog without their headlights on and then they wonder why they get in the car accidents.

1510
02:18:08,425 --> 02:18:09,405
[SPEAKER_15]: Stupid people out there.

1511
02:18:10,249 --> 02:18:24,435
[SPEAKER_15]: Um, also, um, I want to say if, fuck you to, um, the whole launch lineup for the 360, because there's not that much that's out there that I want to get, and I'm kind of dying to get another game.

1512
02:18:25,375 --> 02:18:39,061
[SPEAKER_15]: Um, and then, finally, um, fuck Best Buy for just overall sucking, and, you know, unfortunately I do have a $100, um, gift card to Best Buy, so I actually go there, but...

1513
02:18:40,529 --> 02:18:42,170
[SPEAKER_15]: We don't want no shortage

1514
02:19:10,166 --> 02:19:18,773
[SPEAKER_18]: I would say my FU, I'm going to third the FU because it seems like, to driving, because when it seems like it starts raining in this state, people forget how to drive.

1515
02:19:19,774 --> 02:19:20,815
[SPEAKER_18]: So FU to that.

1516
02:19:20,995 --> 02:19:26,560
[SPEAKER_18]: FU to the fact that I've got like a million and one things I need to do this next week and not enough time to do it.

1517
02:19:28,081 --> 02:19:40,104
[SPEAKER_18]: F you to just angst in general and not feeling happy with certain things and where you're at and just, God, having all this bullshit happen to me around Christmas, what is it about the fucking holidays and what is it about winter time that just makes the shit hit the fan?

1518
02:19:40,124 --> 02:19:40,504
[SPEAKER_18]: I hate it.

1519
02:19:40,984 --> 02:19:44,105
[SPEAKER_18]: So 2005 can go on and get the fuck out of here because we need a new year.

1520
02:19:44,245 --> 02:19:50,946
[SPEAKER_18]: I need a clean slate and I need time to get all my errands done so I don't have to work all freaking day.

1521
02:19:50,986 --> 02:19:51,566
[SPEAKER_18]: It's getting old.

1522
02:19:51,947 --> 02:19:52,207
[SPEAKER_18]: Alright.

1523
02:19:53,347 --> 02:19:53,567
[SPEAKER_18]: Anyway.

1524
02:19:54,605 --> 02:19:55,025
[SPEAKER_18]: That's that.

1525
02:19:55,306 --> 02:19:56,847
[SPEAKER_18]: Let's go to the chatroom FU, shall we?

1526
02:19:56,887 --> 02:19:58,968
[SPEAKER_18]: Let's see what our chatroom angst is tonight.

1527
02:20:01,550 --> 02:20:10,937
[SPEAKER_18]: Ron Chan would like to say FU to my job for keeping me late tonight for work and an FU to me for not taking my TV to the shop sooner since now I have no TV here.

1528
02:20:13,919 --> 02:20:18,861
[SPEAKER_18]: NintendoManiac64 says, F you to more Mario Kart DS Disconnectors.

1529
02:20:19,461 --> 02:20:23,502
[SPEAKER_18]: F you to a deer hitting our van and taking out half of its grill and killing the left light.

1530
02:20:23,942 --> 02:20:26,603
[SPEAKER_18]: F you to Sony, die already like your products do.

1531
02:20:27,583 --> 02:20:29,904
[SPEAKER_18]: DarkTetsuya says, F you to Ultramix 3 again.

1532
02:20:29,984 --> 02:20:32,165
[SPEAKER_18]: First Rainbow Flyer, now Gamma and the couple?

1533
02:20:32,525 --> 02:20:35,046
[SPEAKER_18]: When will PlayStation 2 fans finally get to love?

1534
02:20:36,280 --> 02:20:41,144
[SPEAKER_18]: Sakurina says, F you to requesting Sabrina from Pops.

1535
02:20:41,544 --> 02:20:42,885
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't know if I have it, dude.

1536
02:20:43,466 --> 02:20:44,146
[SPEAKER_18]: Maybe somewhere.

1537
02:20:44,807 --> 02:20:47,028
[SPEAKER_18]: And F you to being nervous and not approaching girls.

1538
02:20:47,389 --> 02:20:48,149
[SPEAKER_18]: Final F you.

1539
02:20:48,229 --> 02:20:49,810
[SPEAKER_18]: Fuck you, almighty snow god.

1540
02:20:51,011 --> 02:20:52,993
[SPEAKER_18]: Get snow while Oregon does.

1541
02:20:53,033 --> 02:20:53,653
[SPEAKER_18]: What the fuck?

1542
02:20:53,934 --> 02:20:56,816
[SPEAKER_18]: You make me want to listen to Rizlem remix, you pitiful being.

1543
02:20:58,803 --> 02:21:05,228
[SPEAKER_18]: ProPanda21 says, F you to crappy heavy metal, crap, and to panda burritos, not polluting the world with their goodness.

1544
02:21:05,748 --> 02:21:05,968
[SPEAKER_18]: What?

1545
02:21:06,449 --> 02:21:09,791
[SPEAKER_18]: And F you to my rainbow queen of the cosmos strap-on for being broken.

1546
02:21:12,313 --> 02:21:17,277
[SPEAKER_18]: Xander C says, F you to, uh, well, nothing, I'm happy tonight, very happy.

1547
02:21:17,577 --> 02:21:19,038
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh, I know, F you to unhappy people.

1548
02:21:20,179 --> 02:21:22,641
[SPEAKER_18]: Roz says, F you to my brother for sitting on my right arm.

1549
02:21:22,921 --> 02:21:25,343
[SPEAKER_18]: It hurts to move and I suck at using my left arm and hand.

1550
02:21:27,110 --> 02:21:50,030
[SPEAKER_18]: DarkKnight says, my FU goes to my car for crushing my cell phone screen, now I know what to get myself for Christmas Saturday, and an FU to my job for opening at 7am this morning, know damn well that no one shops that fucking early on a Sunday, I may have to to get my Christmas shopping done, I don't know, AZM Buddy Paul says, FU to final exams, and FU to my dependence on sleep,

1551
02:21:52,225 --> 02:21:54,507
[SPEAKER_18]: and some FUs coming from Sharks Girl.

1552
02:21:54,988 --> 02:22:03,455
[SPEAKER_18]: FU to miles 12 to 22 of the marathon because hot damn, not only was it hard, but they friggin' ran out of ice in Hawaii.

1553
02:22:03,476 --> 02:22:07,659
[SPEAKER_18]: 80 degrees and 10 miles is bad with no ice, but damn it, I did it.

1554
02:22:09,241 --> 02:22:12,204
[SPEAKER_18]: And that was our last FU tonight.

1555
02:22:12,664 --> 02:22:15,827
[SPEAKER_18]: And congratulations to Sharks Girl, by the way, for running that marathon there.

1556
02:22:16,227 --> 02:22:16,988
[SPEAKER_18]: That's some good stuff.

1557
02:22:19,281 --> 02:22:25,603
[SPEAKER_18]: That's a long way to... I mean, God, I've done the 6 mile marathon and I thought that was bad, but 22, that's... Oh, shit, that's a lot.

1558
02:22:26,303 --> 02:22:32,924
[SPEAKER_18]: NintendoManiac64 also wants to add F you to Rainbow, I'm thinking Rainbow Road, in Mario Kart DS.

1559
02:22:33,324 --> 02:22:35,505
[SPEAKER_18]: Seriously, the first 10 seconds decide the entire race.

1560
02:22:36,205 --> 02:22:37,305
[SPEAKER_18]: That's it, no more F yous, none.

1561
02:22:37,866 --> 02:22:38,746
[SPEAKER_18]: You're done, you're cut off.

1562
02:22:39,126 --> 02:22:39,446
[SPEAKER_18]: All of you.

1563
02:22:41,266 --> 02:22:43,067
[SPEAKER_18]: I want nothing but happiness from here on out.

1564
02:22:44,436 --> 02:22:47,926
[SPEAKER_18]: Except for the break, which will be emo, which I'm very excited about.

1565
02:22:51,738 --> 02:22:53,619
[SPEAKER_18]: So we're getting down to the wire here.

1566
02:22:53,659 --> 02:22:54,599
[SPEAKER_18]: It's almost the end of the year.

1567
02:22:54,639 --> 02:22:59,441
[SPEAKER_18]: You know, the next time we do a live show is going to be 2006, I think, because we're not going to be here next week live.

1568
02:22:59,801 --> 02:23:01,862
[SPEAKER_18]: I think we're going to have a tape thingy-ma-bobber going on.

1569
02:23:02,142 --> 02:23:03,042
[SPEAKER_18]: What is it?

1570
02:23:03,082 --> 02:23:04,923
[SPEAKER_18]: DarkSakura's F'd Up Christmas?

1571
02:23:04,963 --> 02:23:06,104
[SPEAKER_18]: Or what were we going to do next week?

1572
02:23:06,124 --> 02:23:06,584
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't remember.

1573
02:23:06,604 --> 02:23:09,605
[SPEAKER_18]: We were going to pre-tape some fucking stuff.

1574
02:23:09,625 --> 02:23:15,847
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, we need to do... I think we should do the most fucked up Christmas songs we can find.

1575
02:23:16,207 --> 02:23:17,288
[SPEAKER_04]: And like Christmas Speed.

1576
02:23:18,644 --> 02:23:21,927
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh, fuck Christmas Speed, seriously, I fucking hate that CD.

1577
02:23:22,067 --> 02:23:23,188
[SPEAKER_04]: Good, we should play it.

1578
02:23:23,409 --> 02:23:27,172
[SPEAKER_18]: Alright, so we'll do the Orange Lingerie O'Merry fucking Christmas special.

1579
02:23:27,392 --> 02:23:27,993
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah.

1580
02:23:29,034 --> 02:23:30,195
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, I've got to look forward to it.

1581
02:23:30,515 --> 02:23:31,716
[SPEAKER_18]: And then that, what, New Year's?

1582
02:23:31,756 --> 02:23:33,238
[SPEAKER_18]: And we're going to be here on New Year's Day, right?

1583
02:23:33,258 --> 02:23:34,199
[SPEAKER_18]: We'll be back on New Year's Day.

1584
02:23:34,219 --> 02:23:36,741
[SPEAKER_18]: Because nobody does anything on, like, New Year's Day.

1585
02:23:37,502 --> 02:23:40,024
[SPEAKER_04]: Unless I'm, like, still drunk.

1586
02:23:40,144 --> 02:23:43,688
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, let's see, here's the thing, is that New Year's Day, guess what?

1587
02:23:44,770 --> 02:23:46,291
[SPEAKER_18]: Loki has that Monday off work.

1588
02:23:46,772 --> 02:23:48,073
[SPEAKER_18]: I have that Monday off work.

1589
02:23:48,873 --> 02:23:49,714
[SPEAKER_18]: You know what this means.

1590
02:23:49,754 --> 02:23:50,535
[SPEAKER_18]: We're going to kick off 2006.

1591
02:23:52,276 --> 02:23:55,018
[SPEAKER_18]: And would that be 169 or that would be 168?

1592
02:23:55,338 --> 02:23:56,999
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, you know what we could do.

1593
02:23:58,060 --> 02:24:00,722
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I don't know that I should be making this suggestion on the air.

1594
02:24:00,782 --> 02:24:01,863
[SPEAKER_18]: Try me.

1595
02:24:02,203 --> 02:24:02,624
[SPEAKER_18]: Who cares?

1596
02:24:02,704 --> 02:24:03,004
[SPEAKER_18]: Who cares?

1597
02:24:03,164 --> 02:24:06,647
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I'm sure you both are invited to Julie's thing at her condo.

1598
02:24:07,908 --> 02:24:09,669
[SPEAKER_04]: But I was thinking I can bring my laptop.

1599
02:24:10,009 --> 02:24:12,611
[SPEAKER_04]: We might be able to record a little something-something when the new year comes up.

1600
02:24:12,752 --> 02:24:13,452
[SPEAKER_18]: That's a good thought.

1601
02:24:13,472 --> 02:24:14,513
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I'm making apple pie.

1602
02:24:16,386 --> 02:24:17,628
[SPEAKER_18]: Now I want to try some of that apple pie.

1603
02:24:17,648 --> 02:24:18,209
[SPEAKER_18]: That sounds good.

1604
02:24:18,529 --> 02:24:22,295
[SPEAKER_18]: You know, I heard if you drink a whole thing of cop syrup that you'll hallucinate.

1605
02:24:23,214 --> 02:24:24,935
[SPEAKER_18]: We'll do something fun for the New Year's Day show.

1606
02:24:24,955 --> 02:24:25,255
[SPEAKER_18]: That'll be fun.

1607
02:24:25,515 --> 02:24:26,015
[SPEAKER_18]: More drinking.

1608
02:24:26,035 --> 02:24:29,677
[SPEAKER_18]: You know, DDR Freak is not doing their top DDR songs of the year or whatever, so maybe we'll have to pick up the slack.

1609
02:24:29,697 --> 02:24:30,618
[SPEAKER_04]: I need to talk to Iggy.

1610
02:24:47,506 --> 02:24:53,070
[SPEAKER_18]: and see if we can steal that from DDR Freak since they're apparently not doing one this year because they would have done it by now, right?

1611
02:24:53,370 --> 02:24:55,451
[SPEAKER_18]: Because that thing, that poll ran like what, all of December?

1612
02:24:56,972 --> 02:24:57,673
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm going to have to talk.

1613
02:24:57,953 --> 02:24:59,614
[SPEAKER_18]: She's still doing the radio station.

1614
02:24:59,954 --> 02:25:01,035
[SPEAKER_18]: That's public news now.

1615
02:25:01,055 --> 02:25:01,595
[SPEAKER_18]: They posted that.

1616
02:25:01,615 --> 02:25:06,278
[SPEAKER_18]: We know she's not the forum's goddess anymore but she's still doing their radio, right?

1617
02:25:06,298 --> 02:25:06,979
[SPEAKER_18]: We'll talk to Iggy.

1618
02:25:07,319 --> 02:25:09,741
[SPEAKER_18]: We'll invite Iggy over to get drunk with us.

1619
02:25:09,881 --> 02:25:10,281
[SPEAKER_18]: Why not?

1620
02:25:10,301 --> 02:25:10,701
[SPEAKER_18]: That would be fun.

1621
02:25:10,721 --> 02:25:11,482
[SPEAKER_18]: That would be a good time.

1622
02:25:11,782 --> 02:25:12,503
[SPEAKER_18]: We'll all get drunk.

1623
02:25:13,563 --> 02:25:14,364
[SPEAKER_18]: Be good times.

1624
02:25:15,748 --> 02:25:16,069
[SPEAKER_16]: All right.

1625
02:25:17,594 --> 02:25:18,196
[SPEAKER_18]: Let's see.

1626
02:25:18,557 --> 02:25:20,925
[SPEAKER_18]: Episode 200 of Orange Launch Radio shows up next year.

1627
02:25:22,291 --> 02:25:23,311
[SPEAKER_18]: That's going to be crazy.

1628
02:25:24,032 --> 02:25:26,474
[SPEAKER_04]: Man, we've been doing this for a while.

1629
02:25:26,494 --> 02:25:29,616
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, you know what's interesting is, you know what else this kind of marks three years?

1630
02:25:29,757 --> 02:25:32,299
[SPEAKER_18]: Actually, it'll be one more week, but in this next week.

1631
02:25:32,339 --> 02:25:33,880
[SPEAKER_18]: What, Christmas Eve is this next week, right?

1632
02:25:34,440 --> 02:25:39,965
[SPEAKER_18]: This marks three years, three years since DDR Extreme came out in arcades.

1633
02:25:40,885 --> 02:25:46,130
[SPEAKER_18]: That mix is officially three years old now, and basically three years since DDR essentially died in the arcades.

1634
02:25:47,944 --> 02:25:48,805
[SPEAKER_18]: I know it's sad.

1635
02:25:48,845 --> 02:25:50,006
[SPEAKER_18]: I mean, they've had a good life at home.

1636
02:25:50,046 --> 02:25:56,631
[SPEAKER_18]: But In the Groove is out, and whether you love it or hate it, it's trying to pick up the slack that DDR kind of left behind in the arcades.

1637
02:25:56,652 --> 02:25:58,273
[SPEAKER_18]: And then the home mix is a whole other story.

1638
02:25:58,293 --> 02:25:59,274
[SPEAKER_04]: Tommy needs to step it up.

1639
02:26:00,452 --> 02:26:00,832
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't know.

1640
02:26:00,952 --> 02:26:01,392
[SPEAKER_18]: We'll see.

1641
02:26:01,492 --> 02:26:04,773
[SPEAKER_18]: I mean, maybe this will be the year, but of course we said that last year.

1642
02:26:05,013 --> 02:26:06,153
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, and what happened?

1643
02:26:06,353 --> 02:26:06,513
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

1644
02:26:06,833 --> 02:26:07,514
[SPEAKER_18]: Nah, nada.

1645
02:26:07,674 --> 02:26:10,354
[SPEAKER_18]: Although they did have some good home mixes this year.

1646
02:26:10,594 --> 02:26:12,715
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I have to say they've been giving us love with the home mixes.

1647
02:26:12,755 --> 02:26:13,895
[SPEAKER_18]: Extreme 2 was good.

1648
02:26:14,195 --> 02:26:16,016
[SPEAKER_18]: Ultramix 3 was a little... could have been better.

1649
02:26:16,236 --> 02:26:20,277
[SPEAKER_04]: Some of us were more arcade players than we were home players.

1650
02:26:20,297 --> 02:26:21,437
[SPEAKER_18]: The problem with...

1651
02:26:22,233 --> 02:26:31,320
[SPEAKER_18]: What's going on is that, you know, and this is, to Endegroove's credit, whether you love it or hate it, what it's trying to do is it's trying to keep that arcade scene going.

1652
02:26:31,360 --> 02:26:35,223
[SPEAKER_18]: And that is how, I mean, let's face it, that is how we all met, the three of us here that do this show.

1653
02:26:35,563 --> 02:26:45,171
[SPEAKER_18]: We met around a DDR machine, because it used to be the kind of thing that would attract people to come together and play and have a good time together, and we'd all meet at the arcade at a certain night.

1654
02:26:45,211 --> 02:26:48,673
[SPEAKER_18]: We'd have a, what do we call it, Bombani night or DDR night, I don't remember what we called it.

1655
02:26:48,693 --> 02:26:51,716
[SPEAKER_18]: We used to do Wednesdays over at Roosevelt Golf Land,

1656
02:26:52,236 --> 02:26:54,157
[SPEAKER_18]: and, you know, doing the arcade thing.

1657
02:26:54,497 --> 02:26:57,438
[SPEAKER_18]: And that's kind of how we all met, but now that's kind of gone.

1658
02:26:58,798 --> 02:27:03,560
[SPEAKER_18]: Although some arcades have enough of an In the Groove community where that has kind of picked up the slack.

1659
02:27:04,120 --> 02:27:09,802
[SPEAKER_18]: And I don't know, I never really got into In the Groove, but maybe that's because, maybe that's not necessarily In the Groove's fault.

1660
02:27:09,822 --> 02:27:10,862
[SPEAKER_18]: This is something I was thinking about.

1661
02:27:10,902 --> 02:27:12,623
[SPEAKER_18]: Maybe it's not necessarily In the Groove's fault.

1662
02:27:13,203 --> 02:27:13,724
[SPEAKER_18]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1663
02:27:34,172 --> 02:27:34,452
[SPEAKER_18]: DarkSakura.com

1664
02:28:03,379 --> 02:28:09,444
[SPEAKER_18]: Um, let's start it off with, I think this song is pretty fucking depressing, so we're going to start off with a little bit of Silhouette of My Mind.

1665
02:28:09,544 --> 02:28:10,624
[SPEAKER_18]: This is definitely an emo song.

1666
02:28:11,205 --> 02:28:15,688
[SPEAKER_18]: So we'll be back with more, so since we did a happy break, we're going to do the depressing as fuck break, and then we'll be back.

1667
02:28:16,248 --> 02:28:18,230
[SPEAKER_18]: So enjoy this, and we'll be back with more Orange Lounge Radio.

1668
02:28:18,250 --> 02:28:25,795
[SPEAKER_18]: Orange Lounge Radio

1669
02:28:26,995 --> 02:28:30,016
I need to leave, I need to make love

1670
02:28:56,688 --> 02:28:57,849
Thank you for watching!

1671
02:29:19,213 --> 02:29:20,174
Thanks for watching!

1672
02:30:08,548 --> 02:30:09,413
Thanks for watching!

1673
02:30:54,051 --> 02:30:54,855
Thanks for watching!

1674
02:32:03,193 --> 02:32:07,140
I'm ready now, will I fall down if it all becomes too late?

1675
02:32:07,280 --> 02:32:09,864
If I die, I'll die before I die

1676
02:32:44,678 --> 02:32:45,721
Thank you for watching!

1677
02:33:32,139 --> 02:33:33,001
Thanks for watching!

1678
02:34:06,789 --> 02:34:07,778
Thanks for watching!

1679
02:34:38,024 --> 02:34:39,625
Thank you for watching!

1680
02:35:19,176 --> 02:35:22,357
[SPEAKER_18]: After this song, we'll be having a Let Them Move marathon.

1681
02:35:22,657 --> 02:35:24,777
[SPEAKER_09]: No!

1682
02:35:24,897 --> 02:35:25,557
[SPEAKER_18]: Just kidding.

1683
02:35:25,998 --> 02:35:27,038
[SPEAKER_18]: Orange Lounge Radio.

1684
02:35:27,098 --> 02:35:28,718
[SPEAKER_18]: Crap-free Vivani Radio.

1685
02:35:30,519 --> 02:35:31,579
[SPEAKER_18]: Welcome back, boys and girls.

1686
02:35:31,879 --> 02:35:35,380
[SPEAKER_18]: I hope you enjoyed that break of sadness and tragicness.

1687
02:35:36,140 --> 02:35:37,120
[SPEAKER_18]: Deutz de Fatima.

1688
02:35:37,860 --> 02:35:40,441
[SPEAKER_18]: Ghosts, I am gothic and silhouette of my mind.

1689
02:35:40,461 --> 02:35:41,901
[SPEAKER_18]: That was a pretty emotional break.

1690
02:35:41,961 --> 02:35:45,422
[SPEAKER_18]: I think I had a movement in my bowels during that break.

1691
02:35:48,442 --> 02:35:54,824
[SPEAKER_18]: We're going to do a little bit of Ask Orange Lounge, but first, actually, we're going to go to our Skype line and open it up one more time there.

1692
02:35:55,625 --> 02:36:00,967
[SPEAKER_18]: It's www.orangeloungeradio.com and click on Interact With Us if you wish to call the show.

1693
02:36:01,387 --> 02:36:02,887
[SPEAKER_18]: And oh, look, we're already getting a call.

1694
02:36:03,668 --> 02:36:04,928
[SPEAKER_18]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

1695
02:36:05,588 --> 02:36:06,709
[SPEAKER_18]: Hey, hey, hey, it's Ron Chan.

1696
02:36:07,029 --> 02:36:08,429
[SPEAKER_18]: Hello, Ron Chan.

1697
02:36:08,469 --> 02:36:09,350
[SPEAKER_18]: How are you, my friend?

1698
02:36:09,950 --> 02:36:10,470
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm good.

1699
02:36:10,530 --> 02:36:11,390
[SPEAKER_15]: How are you guys?

1700
02:36:11,650 --> 02:36:11,991
[SPEAKER_18]: Good.

1701
02:36:12,031 --> 02:36:12,571
[SPEAKER_18]: What's on your mind?

1702
02:36:13,396 --> 02:36:15,497
[SPEAKER_18]: I have a couple of things I want to talk about real quick.

1703
02:36:15,817 --> 02:36:20,238
[SPEAKER_18]: First, I played Flow to Urban Dance Groove.

1704
02:36:20,498 --> 02:36:22,638
[SPEAKER_18]: Can you get yourself a little closer to your mic, buddy?

1705
02:36:22,658 --> 02:36:23,659
[SPEAKER_18]: We're having a hard time hearing you.

1706
02:36:24,159 --> 02:36:26,039
[SPEAKER_18]: But you got to play Flow?

1707
02:36:26,779 --> 02:36:28,040
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, to Urban Dance Groove.

1708
02:36:28,120 --> 02:36:28,520
[SPEAKER_18]: Much better.

1709
02:36:28,580 --> 02:36:29,300
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay, how was that?

1710
02:36:31,060 --> 02:36:33,601
[SPEAKER_18]: It's Def Jam meets Dance Dance Revolution.

1711
02:36:34,061 --> 02:36:35,221
[SPEAKER_18]: Is this a good thing or a bad thing?

1712
02:36:36,102 --> 02:36:36,662
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't know.

1713
02:36:37,222 --> 02:36:40,823
[SPEAKER_18]: At first I felt kind of offended it was so bad, but yet it was just so funny.

1714
02:36:42,321 --> 02:36:43,541
[SPEAKER_17]: What kind of songs are in this game?

1715
02:36:44,682 --> 02:36:50,864
[SPEAKER_18]: There's a lot of old school stuff like this, and there's a lot of new school stuff I've never even heard of.

1716
02:36:52,384 --> 02:36:52,984
[SPEAKER_18]: That's cool.

1717
02:36:54,065 --> 02:36:54,825
[SPEAKER_18]: How is the interface?

1718
02:36:54,885 --> 02:36:57,466
[SPEAKER_18]: How's the design of the game?

1719
02:36:57,546 --> 02:36:58,206
[SPEAKER_18]: Does it flow?

1720
02:37:00,546 --> 02:37:01,547
[SPEAKER_18]: Pretty much it does.

1721
02:37:01,627 --> 02:37:03,687
[SPEAKER_18]: The dance steps are a little bit too easy, though.

1722
02:37:04,788 --> 02:37:05,128
[SPEAKER_18]: Really?

1723
02:37:05,208 --> 02:37:06,708
[SPEAKER_18]: No really hard mode or anything?

1724
02:37:08,749 --> 02:37:11,990
[SPEAKER_18]: I think the levels are like DDR Mario Mix.

1725
02:37:12,955 --> 02:37:14,136
[SPEAKER_18]: Ooh, that's no good.

1726
02:37:14,316 --> 02:37:23,259
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, okay, but I guess if you're new to dance games, which maybe they're thinking the target audience for Flow is or is not the same group that plays DDR or whatever, I don't know.

1727
02:37:25,460 --> 02:37:27,341
[SPEAKER_18]: Maybe that's just a warm-up.

1728
02:37:27,421 --> 02:37:27,741
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't know.

1729
02:37:27,801 --> 02:37:29,382
[SPEAKER_18]: Maybe... I don't know.

1730
02:37:29,422 --> 02:37:29,682
[SPEAKER_18]: Who knows?

1731
02:37:30,122 --> 02:37:39,606
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't even know what Ubiisoft is thinking because I remember one day I'm coming home and I see flyers for 187 Ride or Die and that game was really horrible.

1732
02:37:42,165 --> 02:37:42,986
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you for watching!

1733
02:37:59,762 --> 02:38:00,103
[SPEAKER_18]: Wow.

1734
02:38:00,543 --> 02:38:01,945
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay.

1735
02:38:02,025 --> 02:38:05,949
[SPEAKER_18]: Actually, a lot of black people play video games.

1736
02:38:05,989 --> 02:38:14,399
[SPEAKER_18]: At least when I watched the video game awards on Spike TV, I would have thought only black people play video games for the parts I watched.

1737
02:38:14,479 --> 02:38:14,739
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't know.

1738
02:38:14,759 --> 02:38:15,500
[SPEAKER_18]: It was just me.

1739
02:38:16,121 --> 02:38:19,604
[SPEAKER_18]: I tell you this, when I play DDR, I know I don't feel alone when I play.

1740
02:38:23,087 --> 02:38:23,788
[SPEAKER_18]: Anyway, okay.

1741
02:38:24,288 --> 02:38:25,249
[SPEAKER_18]: Ray, stuff aside.

1742
02:38:25,549 --> 02:38:28,131
[SPEAKER_18]: How does flow stack up?

1743
02:38:28,191 --> 02:38:31,614
[SPEAKER_18]: I mean, is it a worthy purchase for the music game fan, or is it a piece of crap?

1744
02:38:32,955 --> 02:38:34,116
[SPEAKER_18]: Wait till it drops to 19.

1745
02:38:34,896 --> 02:38:36,197
[SPEAKER_18]: Wait till it drops to 19?

1746
02:38:36,278 --> 02:38:38,599
[SPEAKER_18]: Is that with... Oh, no, because it's for PlayStation, right?

1747
02:38:39,060 --> 02:38:39,300
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah.

1748
02:38:39,560 --> 02:38:41,281
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay, so that you can get the pads separately.

1749
02:38:41,342 --> 02:38:41,562
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay.

1750
02:38:41,942 --> 02:38:42,683
[SPEAKER_18]: Wait for it to drop to 19.

1751
02:38:43,483 --> 02:38:44,604
[SPEAKER_18]: Dark Knight has a question.

1752
02:38:44,884 --> 02:38:46,446
[SPEAKER_18]: Can you crunk in the game?

1753
02:38:47,266 --> 02:38:49,348
[SPEAKER_18]: Only when you buy a 40-ounce to go with it.

1754
02:38:52,057 --> 02:38:52,378
[SPEAKER_18]: Nice.

1755
02:38:53,279 --> 02:38:55,602
[SPEAKER_18]: Alright, anything else going on in the world around him?

1756
02:38:56,483 --> 02:38:57,304
[SPEAKER_18]: Uh, a couple of things.

1757
02:38:57,605 --> 02:39:04,253
[SPEAKER_18]: To answer Loki's question, I've actually seen people drink a full bottle of cork syrup and get crazy at the raves.

1758
02:39:05,455 --> 02:39:06,136
[SPEAKER_18]: Did you hear that, Loki?

1759
02:39:07,310 --> 02:39:10,551
[SPEAKER_18]: He's seen people drink the bottle of cough syrup and get crazy at the raves.

1760
02:39:10,811 --> 02:39:11,271
[SPEAKER_18]: Just so you know.

1761
02:39:11,411 --> 02:39:14,072
[SPEAKER_04]: In response to... Listen to Red with Tess and MC Chris.

1762
02:39:16,852 --> 02:39:19,213
[SPEAKER_18]: And, um... This one is for you, Jamie.

1763
02:39:19,933 --> 02:39:27,315
[SPEAKER_18]: I was... I was coming home off of work tonight and this kid was asking his mom about getting GTA.

1764
02:39:27,995 --> 02:39:30,296
[SPEAKER_18]: And she's like, no, you can't get it because it's...

1765
02:39:30,896 --> 02:39:32,257
[SPEAKER_18]: You're too young for it.

1766
02:39:32,437 --> 02:39:33,058
[SPEAKER_18]: End of story.

1767
02:39:33,678 --> 02:39:37,041
[SPEAKER_18]: So he starts getting all mad and she's like, I'm gonna ask my father to get it.

1768
02:39:37,061 --> 02:39:40,464
[SPEAKER_18]: She's like, well, you do that, you're still not gonna get it, so I'm gonna tell him not to.

1769
02:39:41,024 --> 02:39:41,965
[SPEAKER_18]: And then he goes, you know what?

1770
02:39:42,265 --> 02:39:43,806
[SPEAKER_18]: Fuck you, I'm gonna get it anyway.

1771
02:39:45,608 --> 02:39:47,329
[SPEAKER_18]: The next part was priceless.

1772
02:39:48,370 --> 02:39:51,412
[SPEAKER_18]: She grabbed him by his baggy pants like, you wanna say fuck you?

1773
02:39:51,452 --> 02:39:55,555
[SPEAKER_18]: You wanna say fuck... She proceeded to beat his ass.

1774
02:39:55,896 --> 02:39:56,897
[SPEAKER_18]: That is beautiful.

1775
02:39:57,924 --> 02:39:58,764
[SPEAKER_18]: and many more.

1776
02:40:18,479 --> 02:40:19,940
[SPEAKER_18]: Big Mama, that's all you need to know.

1777
02:40:44,186 --> 02:40:44,686
[SPEAKER_18]: Let's see.

1778
02:40:45,367 --> 02:40:53,310
[SPEAKER_18]: She has donated a Crucian carp to Blathers, and Blathers says, When I hear Crucian carp, I think to myself, taco.

1779
02:40:53,791 --> 02:40:55,231
[SPEAKER_18]: Indeed, fish taco.

1780
02:40:55,311 --> 02:40:55,852
[SPEAKER_18]: What, what?

1781
02:40:59,073 --> 02:41:00,034
[SPEAKER_04]: That just cracked me up.

1782
02:41:00,214 --> 02:41:00,674
[SPEAKER_04]: Taco!

1783
02:41:00,894 --> 02:41:02,735
[SPEAKER_18]: You can see where this show is gone.

1784
02:41:03,435 --> 02:41:05,916
[SPEAKER_18]: Half our show is being done in Animal Crossing tonight, actually.

1785
02:41:06,497 --> 02:41:08,338
[SPEAKER_15]: Now you got me thinking of YTMND.

1786
02:41:09,318 --> 02:41:12,019
[SPEAKER_18]: You know, we should take a picture of that or something and get it on YTMND.

1787
02:41:12,039 --> 02:41:13,300
[SPEAKER_15]: I hate those things.

1788
02:41:15,441 --> 02:41:18,022
[SPEAKER_18]: What is some good stuff on YTMND this week?

1789
02:41:18,042 --> 02:41:19,903
[SPEAKER_18]: Because I don't follow YTMND, but I know you do.

1790
02:41:19,943 --> 02:41:21,964
[SPEAKER_18]: What's some good stuff on GearTheManNow, dawg?

1791
02:41:22,645 --> 02:41:24,646
[SPEAKER_18]: The Foreign DuckTales Translations.

1792
02:41:25,126 --> 02:41:27,067
[SPEAKER_18]: Foreign DuckTales Translations.

1793
02:41:27,467 --> 02:41:30,588
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, there's one where it sounds like they're saying Taco Nazi.

1794
02:41:34,150 --> 02:41:35,471
[SPEAKER_18]: Only on the internet, boys and girls.

1795
02:41:35,531 --> 02:41:36,211
[SPEAKER_18]: Only on the internet.

1796
02:41:36,741 --> 02:41:38,222
[SPEAKER_04]: I did see something fun on the internet.

1797
02:41:38,302 --> 02:41:38,522
[SPEAKER_04]: What?

1798
02:41:38,602 --> 02:41:40,723
[SPEAKER_04]: That Garrett posted.

1799
02:41:41,403 --> 02:41:41,883
[SPEAKER_18]: What was that?

1800
02:41:41,943 --> 02:41:44,844
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't end up watching it.

1801
02:41:44,864 --> 02:41:46,825
[SPEAKER_04]: The how to eat sushi like a snooty bitch.

1802
02:41:47,265 --> 02:41:48,226
[SPEAKER_18]: Does it have talking in it?

1803
02:41:48,286 --> 02:41:49,126
[SPEAKER_18]: Can we play it on the show?

1804
02:41:49,546 --> 02:41:50,507
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's all in Japanese.

1805
02:41:50,807 --> 02:41:51,307
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, that's alright.

1806
02:41:51,347 --> 02:41:51,907
[SPEAKER_18]: It might be funny.

1807
02:41:52,407 --> 02:41:52,728
[SPEAKER_18]: We'll see.

1808
02:41:53,448 --> 02:41:55,209
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, it's linked on my live journal.

1809
02:41:55,309 --> 02:41:55,689
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh, we'll see.

1810
02:41:56,309 --> 02:41:58,070
[SPEAKER_18]: Alright, well, anything else you want to say to our listeners, Ron Chen?

1811
02:41:58,945 --> 02:42:00,886
[SPEAKER_18]: One more thing about what's going on on the internet.

1812
02:42:01,046 --> 02:42:03,568
[SPEAKER_18]: I found something called Genghis Khan.

1813
02:42:03,968 --> 02:42:06,249
[SPEAKER_18]: It's a German pop band.

1814
02:42:06,649 --> 02:42:07,870
[SPEAKER_18]: They're doing this song and dance.

1815
02:42:07,930 --> 02:42:09,091
[SPEAKER_18]: It's just so funny.

1816
02:42:09,291 --> 02:42:09,871
[SPEAKER_18]: It's crazy.

1817
02:42:09,931 --> 02:42:11,412
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm going to post a couple of links to it.

1818
02:42:11,452 --> 02:42:12,132
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, check it out.

1819
02:42:12,513 --> 02:42:14,874
[SPEAKER_18]: It's not Genghis Khan!

1820
02:42:15,174 --> 02:42:15,694
[SPEAKER_18]: It's not that?

1821
02:42:16,435 --> 02:42:19,196
[SPEAKER_18]: It's a German pop group called Genghis Khan.

1822
02:42:19,236 --> 02:42:20,637
[SPEAKER_18]: It's a German word for Genghis.

1823
02:42:21,378 --> 02:42:22,318
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh, okay.

1824
02:42:22,718 --> 02:42:23,079
[SPEAKER_18]: Interesting.

1825
02:42:23,619 --> 02:42:23,979
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah.

1826
02:42:24,419 --> 02:42:24,700
[SPEAKER_18]: All right.

1827
02:42:24,980 --> 02:42:27,181
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, link us in the chat room, all right?

1828
02:42:27,622 --> 02:42:28,202
[SPEAKER_18]: That I will.

1829
02:42:28,362 --> 02:42:28,542
[SPEAKER_18]: Alright.

1830
02:42:28,603 --> 02:42:29,483
[SPEAKER_18]: OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

1831
02:42:29,503 --> 02:42:29,963
[SPEAKER_18]: Click on chat.

1832
02:42:30,323 --> 02:42:30,624
[SPEAKER_18]: Alright.

1833
02:42:31,744 --> 02:42:32,545
[SPEAKER_18]: Have a good one, my friend.

1834
02:42:32,565 --> 02:42:33,325
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you for calling in.

1835
02:42:33,705 --> 02:42:34,145
[SPEAKER_18]: You too.

1836
02:42:34,446 --> 02:42:34,746
[SPEAKER_18]: Alright.

1837
02:42:35,166 --> 02:42:35,786
[SPEAKER_18]: Bye.

1838
02:42:37,367 --> 02:42:37,747
[SPEAKER_18]: Alright.

1839
02:42:38,267 --> 02:42:38,748
[SPEAKER_18]: That was fun.

1840
02:42:39,668 --> 02:42:40,509
[SPEAKER_18]: Our good buddy, Ron Chan.

1841
02:42:40,529 --> 02:42:42,290
[SPEAKER_18]: We're going to get into Ask Orange Lounge in a little bit.

1842
02:42:42,630 --> 02:42:47,592
[SPEAKER_18]: But first, I'm going to log into LiveJournal so I can get that link here that DarkSakura posted there in her blog.

1843
02:42:48,573 --> 02:42:53,575
[SPEAKER_18]: Now, what... I've got to bring it up here, though, so that I can get the audio out.

1844
02:42:53,635 --> 02:42:56,557
[SPEAKER_18]: Now, tell us again what this thing is all about here that we're going to watch.

1845
02:42:57,389 --> 02:43:06,498
[SPEAKER_04]: The proper way to eat sushi, even directions as to how you enter the place, to how you pour your beer for people.

1846
02:43:07,098 --> 02:43:10,942
[SPEAKER_04]: And really, a lot of that is just polite custom, but it's really overblowing it.

1847
02:43:12,023 --> 02:43:12,743
[SPEAKER_04]: It's really funny.

1848
02:43:12,844 --> 02:43:15,866
[SPEAKER_04]: It totally makes fun of a lot of things that people do at sushi restaurants.

1849
02:43:16,267 --> 02:43:18,729
[SPEAKER_18]: Now, it's not super long, is it?

1850
02:43:20,711 --> 02:43:21,091
[SPEAKER_18]: We'll see.

1851
02:43:21,532 --> 02:43:21,732
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

1852
02:43:22,503 --> 02:43:35,335
[SPEAKER_13]: We'll let it kind of start here, and if it's too long, then we'll just kind of... Might have to translate.

1853
02:43:35,476 --> 02:43:37,518
[SPEAKER_18]: The snack most commonly associated with Japan.

1854
02:43:38,759 --> 02:43:41,782
[SPEAKER_18]: A shop that sells sushi is called a sushi-ya.

1855
02:43:42,542 --> 02:43:44,945
[SPEAKER_18]: Most Japanese eat at one every day.

1856
02:43:48,428 --> 02:43:50,095
[SPEAKER_18]: This is the entrance to a Sushiya.

1857
02:43:50,938 --> 02:43:53,046
[SPEAKER_18]: To pass through the short curtain called Noren,

1858
02:43:53,971 --> 02:44:00,677
[SPEAKER_18]: From the lower left corner of the third partition, find the spot 3.2 inches up at an angle of 48 degrees.

1859
02:44:01,077 --> 02:44:02,719
[SPEAKER_18]: Place your hand like this and peel open.

1860
02:44:04,280 --> 02:44:09,365
[SPEAKER_18]: If you arrive less than 30 minutes before closing, ask, are you still open?

1861
02:44:09,505 --> 02:44:11,647
[SPEAKER_13]: On entering the premises, inside,

1862
02:44:19,464 --> 02:44:19,844
[SPEAKER_18]: 2 people.

1863
02:44:20,665 --> 02:44:21,926
[SPEAKER_18]: This is the number in your group.

1864
02:44:22,506 --> 02:44:23,607
[SPEAKER_18]: In a group of 3, say.

1865
02:44:23,627 --> 02:44:25,549
[SPEAKER_18]: 3 people.

1866
02:44:26,449 --> 02:44:27,370
[SPEAKER_18]: In a group of 4, say.

1867
02:44:27,690 --> 02:44:28,691
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay, this is getting boring.

1868
02:44:28,731 --> 02:44:29,892
[SPEAKER_18]: When does this get good?

1869
02:44:30,332 --> 02:44:31,593
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just the whole thing is silly.

1870
02:44:32,053 --> 02:44:35,676
[SPEAKER_04]: You should always show a little guilt in your eyes if you're alone.

1871
02:44:36,520 --> 02:44:38,022
[SPEAKER_18]: Why would you be guilty if you're alone?

1872
02:44:38,042 --> 02:44:39,304
[SPEAKER_18]: What if you're on business or something?

1873
02:44:40,805 --> 02:44:46,011
[SPEAKER_18]: You know, we actually, we used to have a place here locally called Sushiya, so I think that's kind of funny.

1874
02:44:46,171 --> 02:44:48,074
[SPEAKER_04]: I know, I'm sad that Sushiya is closed.

1875
02:44:48,294 --> 02:44:51,097
[SPEAKER_04]: These two men look like they're going to get it on.

1876
02:44:53,940 --> 02:44:54,760
[SPEAKER_18]: No.

1877
02:44:54,780 --> 02:44:55,661
[SPEAKER_18]: They were hella flirting.

1878
02:44:55,821 --> 02:44:56,441
[SPEAKER_18]: Did you see that?

1879
02:44:56,501 --> 02:44:57,322
[SPEAKER_13]: Is this seat taken?

1880
02:44:57,522 --> 02:45:01,764
[SPEAKER_13]: I'll post it in the chat room.

1881
02:45:01,904 --> 02:45:04,405
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, post the link in the chat room.

1882
02:45:04,425 --> 02:45:04,965
[SPEAKER_18]: It's hilarious.

1883
02:45:05,326 --> 02:45:05,606
[SPEAKER_18]: Alright.

1884
02:45:06,866 --> 02:45:07,407
[SPEAKER_18]: That'll be fun.

1885
02:45:14,590 --> 02:45:16,591
[SPEAKER_18]: Where did those faces come from?

1886
02:45:17,912 --> 02:45:20,193
[SPEAKER_18]: Blanca in Animal Crossing there.

1887
02:45:20,333 --> 02:45:21,713
[SPEAKER_04]: Is OLR Town still open?

1888
02:45:21,753 --> 02:45:22,954
[SPEAKER_04]: I did a zombie face on her.

1889
02:45:24,654 --> 02:45:28,375
[SPEAKER_15]: OLR Town is currently closed at the moment, but I can open it back up.

1890
02:45:28,395 --> 02:45:28,995
[SPEAKER_15]: Open it back up.

1891
02:45:29,435 --> 02:45:29,875
[SPEAKER_15]: Hold on.

1892
02:45:34,937 --> 02:45:35,197
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay.

1893
02:45:36,097 --> 02:45:39,158
[SPEAKER_18]: Let's go to some Ask Orange Lounge, boys and girls, because we promised it.

1894
02:45:45,973 --> 02:45:48,894
[SPEAKER_18]: Let's Ask Orange Lounge some stupid question.

1895
02:45:49,415 --> 02:45:52,676
[SPEAKER_18]: What will we find out this week on Orange Lounge Radio?

1896
02:45:53,316 --> 02:46:00,019
[SPEAKER_18]: Will we find out the best of 2005 or is the best yet to come in the next two weeks?

1897
02:46:09,804 --> 02:46:14,746
[SPEAKER_18]: Nintendo Maniac 64 says, Hey Loki, what do you think about gay sex?

1898
02:46:18,803 --> 02:46:21,144
[SPEAKER_18]: Now that's one of the best jokes of 2005 right there.

1899
02:46:21,204 --> 02:46:22,925
[SPEAKER_18]: One of the best Orange Lounge Radio jokes of 2005.

1900
02:46:23,065 --> 02:46:26,247
[SPEAKER_18]: You don't have a response to that, Loki?

1901
02:46:28,848 --> 02:46:31,290
[SPEAKER_18]: Um, gay sex, that's sex and gay.

1902
02:46:32,770 --> 02:46:35,452
[SPEAKER_18]: Hey, Loki, what do you think about gay sex?

1903
02:46:35,812 --> 02:46:36,793
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh, it's so much fun.

1904
02:46:38,834 --> 02:46:39,314
[SPEAKER_18]: There you have it.

1905
02:46:42,613 --> 02:46:44,534
[SPEAKER_18]: Sky, what do you think about Big Dick?

1906
02:46:45,475 --> 02:46:47,096
[SPEAKER_18]: What the fuck kind of question is that?

1907
02:46:47,996 --> 02:46:49,778
[SPEAKER_18]: It's size is relative, people.

1908
02:46:50,478 --> 02:46:50,898
[SPEAKER_18]: Doesn't matter.

1909
02:46:50,939 --> 02:46:52,360
[SPEAKER_18]: It's not the size, it's how you use it.

1910
02:46:54,801 --> 02:47:00,325
[SPEAKER_18]: When you hear my name, well, username, Nintendomaniac64, what about me do you think of?

1911
02:47:01,526 --> 02:47:02,667
[SPEAKER_18]: The fact that you like Nintendo?

1912
02:47:02,727 --> 02:47:03,427
[SPEAKER_18]: I mean, I... The toilet.

1913
02:47:04,148 --> 02:47:04,728
[SPEAKER_18]: The toilet.

1914
02:47:08,962 --> 02:47:12,843
[SPEAKER_18]: I think about all that fucking snaking that you do in Mario Kart DS.

1915
02:47:13,723 --> 02:47:15,624
[SPEAKER_18]: What language is the best other than English?

1916
02:47:15,684 --> 02:47:16,304
[SPEAKER_18]: I like this question.

1917
02:47:16,324 --> 02:47:17,804
[SPEAKER_18]: What language is the best other than English?

1918
02:47:18,585 --> 02:47:19,085
[SPEAKER_04]: Swahili.

1919
02:47:20,125 --> 02:47:20,425
[SPEAKER_18]: Loki?

1920
02:47:22,566 --> 02:47:23,706
[SPEAKER_18]: What's the best language?

1921
02:47:23,766 --> 02:47:24,426
[SPEAKER_18]: Other than English?

1922
02:47:24,486 --> 02:47:24,906
[SPEAKER_15]: Finnish.

1923
02:47:24,946 --> 02:47:25,926
[SPEAKER_15]: Other than English?

1924
02:47:29,487 --> 02:47:29,968
[SPEAKER_18]: Swedish.

1925
02:47:31,168 --> 02:47:32,148
[SPEAKER_18]: I would say Pig Latin.

1926
02:47:34,769 --> 02:47:35,189
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it would be.

1927
02:47:37,482 --> 02:47:43,744
[SPEAKER_18]: Uh, VXJasonXV, our faithful webmaster, says, Dear Orange Launch Radio, would you like a new website?

1928
02:47:44,284 --> 02:47:44,644
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes!

1929
02:47:44,804 --> 02:47:45,925
[SPEAKER_18]: OMG, yes, please.

1930
02:47:47,005 --> 02:47:49,306
[SPEAKER_18]: As long as we can update the news easy on the new one, yes.

1931
02:47:49,806 --> 02:47:54,387
[SPEAKER_18]: I actually, I want to talk to you offline about that, Jason, because of something later.

1932
02:47:54,527 --> 02:47:55,788
[SPEAKER_04]: I am going to say something on record.

1933
02:47:56,088 --> 02:47:56,288
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes.

1934
02:47:56,608 --> 02:47:58,269
[SPEAKER_04]: I am taking Flash next semester.

1935
02:47:59,589 --> 02:48:00,069
[SPEAKER_18]: Scare.

1936
02:48:03,050 --> 02:48:04,450
[SPEAKER_18]: She's going to make her own YTMNDs.

1937
02:48:04,610 --> 02:48:05,591
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm very excited about that.

1938
02:48:06,576 --> 02:48:07,476
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I'm not.

1939
02:48:07,556 --> 02:48:09,257
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to make something special.

1940
02:48:10,197 --> 02:48:13,619
[SPEAKER_18]: Rene would like to know, is Akira Yamaoka gay?

1941
02:48:13,639 --> 02:48:17,340
[SPEAKER_18]: I hope not, because he's going to be my next husband.

1942
02:48:17,400 --> 02:48:18,760
[SPEAKER_18]: I saw this on some web form.

1943
02:48:18,780 --> 02:48:20,441
[SPEAKER_18]: They were seriously debating if he was gay or not.

1944
02:48:21,441 --> 02:48:31,485
[SPEAKER_18]: I could swear that there's some interview out there, and Rice Princess pointed this out to me, where he said that the first song he wrote, or one of the songs he wrote on piano, was about some girl.

1945
02:48:32,245 --> 02:48:33,226
[SPEAKER_18]: So I don't think he's gay.

1946
02:48:33,266 --> 02:48:36,047
[SPEAKER_18]: And when I, you know, I am gay, so I have gaydar.

1947
02:48:36,327 --> 02:48:39,589
[SPEAKER_18]: When I met him, because I actually met him at E3 a couple years ago, he didn't strike me as gay.

1948
02:48:39,829 --> 02:48:41,410
[SPEAKER_18]: So, does it really matter, though?

1949
02:48:41,470 --> 02:48:42,411
[SPEAKER_18]: He struck me as hot.

1950
02:48:42,691 --> 02:48:44,452
[SPEAKER_18]: Does it really matter if he's gay?

1951
02:48:44,612 --> 02:48:46,253
[SPEAKER_18]: Although the shirt he wore was kind of gay.

1952
02:48:46,633 --> 02:48:47,214
[SPEAKER_18]: I mean, that was gay.

1953
02:48:47,514 --> 02:48:48,815
[SPEAKER_18]: But that's okay.

1954
02:48:49,155 --> 02:48:50,476
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't really care if he's gay or not.

1955
02:48:50,556 --> 02:48:51,716
[SPEAKER_18]: He can make good music.

1956
02:48:52,037 --> 02:48:54,678
[SPEAKER_18]: But I know that's a big controversial thing on the internet right now.

1957
02:48:54,738 --> 02:48:55,218
[SPEAKER_18]: Who cares?

1958
02:48:59,716 --> 02:49:02,198
[SPEAKER_18]: What is the... Oh, maybe that's why we got rid of this microphone.

1959
02:49:02,219 --> 02:49:03,119
[SPEAKER_18]: This is the buzzing microphone.

1960
02:49:03,139 --> 02:49:03,380
[SPEAKER_18]: We'll see.

1961
02:49:03,960 --> 02:49:07,724
[SPEAKER_18]: And what is the ultimate Bomani song when listened to in moderation?

1962
02:49:07,824 --> 02:49:09,686
[SPEAKER_18]: Ooh, the ultimate Bomani song.

1963
02:49:10,707 --> 02:49:11,147
[SPEAKER_18]: What do you think?

1964
02:49:11,367 --> 02:49:12,448
[SPEAKER_18]: The ultimate Bomani song.

1965
02:49:12,589 --> 02:49:13,169
[SPEAKER_18]: DarkSakura.

1966
02:49:15,932 --> 02:49:17,073
[SPEAKER_04]: My butt, the ass mix.

1967
02:49:17,834 --> 02:49:18,294
[SPEAKER_04]: Stop.

1968
02:49:19,495 --> 02:49:19,856
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

1969
02:49:20,997 --> 02:49:21,217
[SPEAKER_17]: Loki?

1970
02:49:24,362 --> 02:49:30,747
[SPEAKER_15]: Um, I still like, um, what was it, um, moving on.

1971
02:49:34,229 --> 02:49:46,198
[SPEAKER_18]: I have a real fond place for drifting away, but I also love, love, love, and this doesn't even have to be in moderation, I could just listen to this on repeat all day long, Skulk, from Ultimix 2, I just, I absolutely love that song.

1972
02:49:47,459 --> 02:49:47,699
[SPEAKER_19]: Love it!

1973
02:49:51,951 --> 02:49:56,254
[SPEAKER_18]: Sakurina wants to know how does one know if he or she has an STD?

1974
02:49:56,334 --> 02:49:58,115
[SPEAKER_18]: More precisely, how do you get it checked?

1975
02:49:59,860 --> 02:50:01,761
[SPEAKER_18]: How does one know if he or she has an STD?

1976
02:50:02,121 --> 02:50:03,542
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, there are signs.

1977
02:50:04,603 --> 02:50:08,845
[SPEAKER_18]: There's lots and lots of different types of STDs, so the best way to find out really is to get tested.

1978
02:50:09,265 --> 02:50:15,027
[SPEAKER_18]: Get tested for STDs, and that's how you're going to know, because the doctor can shove something in your pee hole and find out that way.

1979
02:50:16,108 --> 02:50:18,849
[SPEAKER_18]: Or, you know, there's tests you can do, blood tests and things.

1980
02:50:18,909 --> 02:50:20,570
[SPEAKER_18]: It just depends what STD you're looking for.

1981
02:50:20,590 --> 02:50:27,413
[SPEAKER_18]: I mean, crabs, well, if your pubes itch a lot and there's little things bouncing, no, not really, you can't always see it, you probably have crabs.

1982
02:50:28,897 --> 02:50:31,157
[SPEAKER_18]: If something's wrong, go to the doctor.

1983
02:50:31,277 --> 02:50:33,398
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're itchy, use a cream.

1984
02:50:33,798 --> 02:50:43,660
[SPEAKER_18]: You can look up symptoms on a site like WebMD, or I can tell you from my background, I work for an insurance company, a lot of insurance companies have, well, wait, you're Canadian though, so I don't know what to tell you.

1985
02:50:43,940 --> 02:50:48,181
[SPEAKER_18]: Never mind, I forgot he's Canadian, so it's an entirely different ballgame.

1986
02:50:48,741 --> 02:50:54,142
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't know if they have advice nurses, something like that in Canada, but if they have something like that, check it out.

1987
02:50:55,302 --> 02:50:57,203
[SPEAKER_18]: They can call on the phone, because they have that here.

1988
02:50:57,283 --> 02:50:58,184
[SPEAKER_18]: Insurance companies have that.

1989
02:50:58,404 --> 02:51:00,165
[SPEAKER_18]: Anything else you want to add, Loki?

1990
02:51:00,906 --> 02:51:18,538
[SPEAKER_15]: I just want to add that I drew a penis on Blanka's face, and this will be going to some random user's DS out there, and I'm glad that a little kid's going to see a penis on Blanka's face, and it's going to have my credit to it.

1991
02:51:18,618 --> 02:51:18,958
[SPEAKER_18]: Good job.

1992
02:51:20,143 --> 02:51:22,764
[SPEAKER_18]: Xander C wants to know, why aren't more people happy?

1993
02:51:23,364 --> 02:51:25,944
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm happy, so should everyone else be happy.

1994
02:51:26,405 --> 02:51:30,886
[SPEAKER_18]: But if they think about geometry, they should want to kill people, like me, because I am the cool, right?

1995
02:51:32,266 --> 02:51:33,586
[SPEAKER_18]: Dude, what drugs are you on, seriously?

1996
02:51:36,287 --> 02:51:37,287
[SPEAKER_18]: No, I don't know.

1997
02:51:38,127 --> 02:51:39,548
[SPEAKER_18]: What kind of things make you happy?

1998
02:51:40,148 --> 02:51:40,968
[SPEAKER_18]: That's what I want to know.

1999
02:51:41,568 --> 02:51:42,668
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm changing this question a little bit.

2000
02:51:42,708 --> 02:51:43,629
[SPEAKER_18]: What makes you happy?

2001
02:51:43,729 --> 02:51:44,669
[SPEAKER_18]: Loki, what makes you happy?

2002
02:51:48,544 --> 02:51:51,284
[SPEAKER_15]: Um, pleasure makes me happy.

2003
02:51:51,304 --> 02:51:51,805
[SPEAKER_15]: Like what?

2004
02:51:51,845 --> 02:51:52,705
[SPEAKER_18]: Pleasure makes you happy?

2005
02:51:52,985 --> 02:51:54,326
[SPEAKER_15]: Any pleasure makes me happy.

2006
02:51:54,826 --> 02:51:55,106
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay.

2007
02:51:55,706 --> 02:51:57,006
[SPEAKER_18]: DarkSakura, what makes you happy?

2008
02:51:59,567 --> 02:52:01,688
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, a day off of work.

2009
02:52:02,768 --> 02:52:04,089
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm surprised you didn't say fire.

2010
02:52:04,689 --> 02:52:07,350
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I like fire, but I can get that anytime I want it.

2011
02:52:07,590 --> 02:52:08,450
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, it's like sex.

2012
02:52:09,351 --> 02:52:12,132
[SPEAKER_04]: So, but I can't always get a day off of work when I want it.

2013
02:52:12,692 --> 02:52:14,952
[SPEAKER_04]: So, a day off of work, just to do whatever I want to.

2014
02:52:15,293 --> 02:52:16,133
[SPEAKER_18]: You know what makes me happy?

2015
02:52:17,245 --> 02:52:17,465
[SPEAKER_18]: Abba.

2016
02:52:18,646 --> 02:52:19,526
[SPEAKER_18]: Abba makes me happy.

2017
02:52:21,186 --> 02:52:22,447
[SPEAKER_04]: Abba makes everybody happy.

2018
02:52:22,467 --> 02:52:29,349
[SPEAKER_04]: You cannot help but be happy listening to Abba.

2019
02:52:29,409 --> 02:52:30,430
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh, I'm sorry.

2020
02:52:33,991 --> 02:52:34,451
[SPEAKER_18]: Moving on.

2021
02:52:35,892 --> 02:52:36,052
[SPEAKER_18]: What?

2022
02:52:36,072 --> 02:52:36,872
[SPEAKER_04]: I know what makes me happy.

2023
02:52:37,472 --> 02:52:37,732
[SPEAKER_04]: Bear.

2024
02:52:39,153 --> 02:52:39,773
[SPEAKER_18]: By the gorillas?

2025
02:52:39,953 --> 02:52:40,153
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

2026
02:52:41,505 --> 02:52:42,406
[SPEAKER_18]: or Truth or Dare.

2027
02:52:42,446 --> 02:52:44,887
[SPEAKER_18]: Truth or Dare can make me happy when things go my way.

2028
02:52:45,387 --> 02:52:47,969
[SPEAKER_18]: I play Truth or Dare.

2029
02:52:48,709 --> 02:52:53,452
[SPEAKER_04]: Now with my new stereo, that song sounds completely fabulous in my car and I get really hyper and drive fast.

2030
02:52:54,633 --> 02:52:55,674
[SPEAKER_04]: My car makes me happy too.

2031
02:52:57,275 --> 02:52:59,116
[SPEAKER_18]: Alright, NeoDudeZero.

2032
02:52:59,496 --> 02:53:02,158
[SPEAKER_18]: Hey, did you hear about all the new games in development for the DS?

2033
02:53:02,398 --> 02:53:06,800
[SPEAKER_18]: One will raise your IQ as you play it and the other teaches little girls how to orgasm.

2034
02:53:07,881 --> 02:53:09,382
[SPEAKER_09]: That one's not coming out as conceptual.

2035
02:53:10,188 --> 02:53:10,789
[SPEAKER_18]: What's this, Loki?

2036
02:53:11,089 --> 02:53:11,309
[SPEAKER_18]: Mike?

2037
02:53:11,509 --> 02:53:14,192
[SPEAKER_18]: So the game is not coming out, it's just a conceptual game.

2038
02:53:14,552 --> 02:53:15,913
[SPEAKER_18]: Where's this all from?

2039
02:53:15,973 --> 02:53:16,934
[SPEAKER_18]: Is this like a website or something?

2040
02:53:16,954 --> 02:53:25,381
[SPEAKER_15]: It's this little game you play with like a rabbit, and it supposedly teaches you the way to rub out orgasms, you make the rabbit happy.

2041
02:53:26,302 --> 02:53:31,487
[SPEAKER_15]: So it's like Masturbation Technique 101 or something, the game.

2042
02:53:34,682 --> 02:53:37,323
[SPEAKER_18]: Illusion asks a question that simply says, vagina.

2043
02:53:38,024 --> 02:53:39,644
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm sorry, not vagina.

2044
02:53:39,684 --> 02:53:40,224
[SPEAKER_18]: It's not a statement.

2045
02:53:40,264 --> 02:53:41,345
[SPEAKER_18]: It's vagina?

2046
02:53:45,867 --> 02:53:47,628
[SPEAKER_09]: Chup, chup, chup, chup, chup.

2047
02:53:49,829 --> 02:53:53,490
[SPEAKER_09]: Tasty.

2048
02:53:57,712 --> 02:53:57,952
[SPEAKER_18]: What?

2049
02:53:58,052 --> 02:53:59,133
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't know what you want me to say.

2050
02:54:01,718 --> 02:54:04,440
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for bringing us to Crashing a Hulk!

2051
02:54:04,500 --> 02:54:04,900
[SPEAKER_18]: Good job.

2052
02:54:04,960 --> 02:54:05,761
[SPEAKER_18]: You broke our show.

2053
02:54:05,821 --> 02:54:06,181
[SPEAKER_18]: Good job.

2054
02:54:06,602 --> 02:54:10,104
[SPEAKER_18]: So, uh, since you broke our show, here's some, uh, more ABBA to make us happy again.

2055
02:54:13,067 --> 02:54:14,528
[SPEAKER_18]: This show has just gotten weird.

2056
02:54:17,430 --> 02:54:18,170
[SPEAKER_02]: More ABBA.

2057
02:54:18,190 --> 02:54:19,351
[SPEAKER_02]: No, we need more cowbells.

2058
02:54:20,372 --> 02:54:21,253
[SPEAKER_04]: Play Don't Fear the Reaper.

2059
02:54:29,742 --> 02:54:39,307
[SPEAKER_09]: You can dance, you can jive Having the time of your life Okay, this show's gotten too gay.

2060
02:54:39,968 --> 02:54:40,188
[SPEAKER_18]: Sorry.

2061
02:54:42,589 --> 02:54:42,929
[SPEAKER_18]: Too gay.

2062
02:54:45,711 --> 02:54:49,393
[SPEAKER_18]: Nintendo Maniac64 says, Can I erase someone in Mario Kart DS?

2063
02:54:49,493 --> 02:54:53,635
[SPEAKER_18]: I won't even snake, but I will powerslide insanely on turns, so fear.

2064
02:54:54,916 --> 02:54:55,016
[SPEAKER_18]: Um...

2065
02:54:57,697 --> 02:55:03,704
[SPEAKER_18]: I have a copy of Mario Kart DS in the other room, but I'm too busy playing Final Fantasy Advance 4.

2066
02:55:03,744 --> 02:55:08,749
[SPEAKER_18]: If I'm going to turn that fucking thing on, I'm beating Final Fantasy Advance 4, because I haven't beaten a video game in forever.

2067
02:55:09,330 --> 02:55:11,091
[SPEAKER_18]: I love Final Fantasy 4, too.

2068
02:55:11,152 --> 02:55:11,892
[SPEAKER_18]: It's so great.

2069
02:55:12,413 --> 02:55:12,893
[SPEAKER_18]: So great.

2070
02:55:14,615 --> 02:55:15,977
[SPEAKER_18]: But ask our chat room.

2071
02:55:17,117 --> 02:55:19,819
[SPEAKER_18]: I actually did one specifically just for friend codes in all of the available games.

2072
02:55:19,859 --> 02:55:26,083
[SPEAKER_18]: Because we had one for Mario Kart DS, but since more and more games are going to come out that have friend code adding ability, I thought I'd just put it up there.

2073
02:55:41,786 --> 02:55:42,106
[SPEAKER_18]: Good deal.

2074
02:55:42,707 --> 02:55:48,970
[SPEAKER_18]: But be sure in that thread you say who you're adding because in a lot of these games you have to have both people on the list.

2075
02:55:49,611 --> 02:55:50,831
[SPEAKER_18]: So make sure you say who you're adding.

2076
02:55:51,672 --> 02:55:55,574
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh yeah, there's those other websites too.

2077
02:55:55,994 --> 02:56:01,457
[SPEAKER_18]: DSMeet, and I want to say one of our listeners, BigRedPimp, had another one that's a popular DSMeeting site.

2078
02:56:01,497 --> 02:56:03,759
[SPEAKER_18]: But you know, stick to the Orange Lounge cult.

2079
02:56:04,839 --> 02:56:05,540
[SPEAKER_18]: Stick to our forums.

2080
02:56:08,081 --> 02:56:10,803
[SPEAKER_18]: Illusion had another question and the question was Waterloo?

2081
02:56:19,184 --> 02:56:20,225
[SPEAKER_18]: I could do this all night, you guys.

2082
02:56:20,405 --> 02:56:21,206
[SPEAKER_18]: I could do it all night long.

2083
02:56:22,788 --> 02:56:26,652
[SPEAKER_18]: AZM Buddy Paul wants to know, Skye, are you the dancing queen?

2084
02:56:26,912 --> 02:56:29,635
[SPEAKER_18]: Actually, I'm a terrible dancer, actually.

2085
02:56:30,235 --> 02:56:33,138
[SPEAKER_04]: No, no, no, this is great, because Rob Hat does the choo-choo dance.

2086
02:56:34,179 --> 02:56:36,502
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the only way I can describe it.

2087
02:56:37,102 --> 02:56:42,007
[SPEAKER_18]: Actually, I think it was Eddie or somebody used to label me as, I would roll down the window when I dance.

2088
02:56:42,788 --> 02:56:44,948
[SPEAKER_18]: When I play DDR, I'm always rolling down the window.

2089
02:56:45,168 --> 02:56:46,089
[SPEAKER_18]: The choo-choo dance.

2090
02:56:47,389 --> 02:56:51,410
[SPEAKER_04]: I had never really seen you do the choo-choo dance until we went to Asylum.

2091
02:56:52,530 --> 02:56:57,131
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, keep in mind, this is the goth night at one of our local clubs.

2092
02:56:57,911 --> 02:57:00,311
[SPEAKER_04]: And they played Girls and Boys.

2093
02:57:01,552 --> 02:57:02,992
[SPEAKER_04]: I had to go back in there because it was blur.

2094
02:57:03,492 --> 02:57:05,332
[SPEAKER_04]: And Rob gets out there and does the choo-choo dance.

2095
02:57:05,352 --> 02:57:07,533
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm sitting there just watching Rob, and I'm drunk off my ass.

2096
02:57:08,735 --> 02:57:11,277
[SPEAKER_04]: Singing along while Rob's doing the choo-choo dance.

2097
02:57:11,337 --> 02:57:11,717
[SPEAKER_04]: It's funny.

2098
02:57:11,897 --> 02:57:19,303
[SPEAKER_18]: It's not so much the choo-choo dance as it is the white people dance.

2099
02:57:19,583 --> 02:57:21,965
[SPEAKER_18]: You know, somebody needs to teach me how to dance.

2100
02:57:21,985 --> 02:57:25,768
[SPEAKER_18]: See, I need to befriend... Is this a movie somewhere, maybe?

2101
02:57:25,868 --> 02:57:31,192
[SPEAKER_18]: I need to befriend a black person with rhythm to teach me how to dance.

2102
02:57:31,813 --> 02:57:33,854
[SPEAKER_18]: And, like, I enter a competition and win a lot of money.

2103
02:57:35,376 --> 02:57:36,436
[SPEAKER_18]: Is that White Man Can't Jump?

2104
02:57:37,097 --> 02:57:37,397
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't know.

2105
02:57:38,298 --> 02:57:38,418
[SPEAKER_18]: No.

2106
02:57:40,222 --> 02:57:47,770
[SPEAKER_04]: The only thing I remember about that movie is what's her name who decided that she was going to be on Jeopardy.

2107
02:57:49,232 --> 02:57:50,593
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the only thing about that movie I remember.

2108
02:57:52,916 --> 02:57:54,738
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't remember any of that.

2109
02:57:57,761 --> 02:57:58,782
[SPEAKER_18]: I actually never saw that movie.

2110
02:57:59,783 --> 02:58:00,884
[SPEAKER_18]: Something I should probably share there.

2111
02:58:00,904 --> 02:58:02,166
[SPEAKER_18]: I never even saw that movie.

2112
02:58:03,929 --> 02:58:17,676
[SPEAKER_18]: Some folks in the chat room are getting a little angsty because we're playing so much ABBA, and they want to hear some disco prints from We Heart Katamari, I don't know, maybe like as alternate disco, so... That's all you get.

2113
02:58:19,177 --> 02:58:27,241
[SPEAKER_18]: That reminds me, me and Mike Katamari comes out to the BSP this week for the Japanese, which means I'll have it.

2114
02:58:27,401 --> 02:58:28,162
[SPEAKER_18]: Really, this week?

2115
02:58:28,702 --> 02:58:29,202
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, the 22nd.

2116
02:58:29,242 --> 02:58:29,903
[SPEAKER_18]: Sweet!

2117
02:58:31,823 --> 02:58:32,424
[SPEAKER_17]: That's awesome.

2118
02:58:33,140 --> 02:58:34,341
[SPEAKER_18]: No more ABBA requests.

2119
02:58:34,401 --> 02:58:37,263
[SPEAKER_18]: Stop ABBA... God damn, now I have all these requests for ABBA.

2120
02:58:37,283 --> 02:58:43,708
[SPEAKER_04]: The secret of me and my Katamari is that all the music is going to be done by me and my... Doop-be-doop-be-doop-be-doop-doop-doop.

2121
02:58:44,729 --> 02:58:46,750
[SPEAKER_04]: They didn't do... Yeah, they did, didn't they?

2122
02:58:46,870 --> 02:58:47,371
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes, they did.

2123
02:58:47,871 --> 02:58:50,193
[SPEAKER_04]: I have a really cool song that they did, though, that wasn't in DDR.

2124
02:58:50,293 --> 02:58:51,454
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe I'll put it in the cage match one day.

2125
02:58:52,314 --> 02:58:52,975
[SPEAKER_04]: If I haven't already.

2126
02:58:53,996 --> 02:58:56,217
[SPEAKER_18]: Wasn't that... Were they the ones that did Lion Eddie?

2127
02:58:56,257 --> 02:58:57,078
[SPEAKER_18]: No, no, that's Smile Decay.

2128
02:58:57,118 --> 02:58:57,818
[SPEAKER_04]: No, they did Takeru...

2129
02:59:00,709 --> 02:59:01,632
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh yeah, I like that song.

2130
02:59:01,652 --> 02:59:02,113
[SPEAKER_04]: That was pretty.

2131
02:59:02,454 --> 02:59:03,698
[SPEAKER_18]: Good times, good times.

2132
02:59:04,175 --> 02:59:06,917
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you so much for tuning in and listening tonight.

2133
02:59:06,957 --> 02:59:08,538
[SPEAKER_18]: And I'm glad we didn't get the plug pulled on us.

2134
02:59:08,578 --> 02:59:08,859
[SPEAKER_18]: That's good.

2135
02:59:08,879 --> 02:59:11,180
[SPEAKER_18]: That's always good news to not get the plug pulled on us.

2136
02:59:11,220 --> 02:59:13,042
[SPEAKER_18]: Let's go around and get everybody's final thought.

2137
02:59:13,062 --> 02:59:13,902
[SPEAKER_18]: Loki, your final thought tonight.

2138
02:59:32,540 --> 02:59:35,022
[SPEAKER_18]: My final thought is I just found the money rock.

2139
02:59:36,043 --> 02:59:36,424
[SPEAKER_18]: Good job.

2140
02:59:37,464 --> 02:59:41,448
[SPEAKER_18]: My final thought is time.

2141
02:59:42,369 --> 02:59:42,769
[SPEAKER_18]: Need more.

2142
02:59:43,490 --> 02:59:44,551
[SPEAKER_18]: DarkSakura, your final thought.

2143
02:59:46,452 --> 02:59:49,175
[SPEAKER_04]: Reject false icons and someone give me a cure for the plague.

2144
02:59:50,751 --> 02:59:53,773
[SPEAKER_18]: Alright, that's going to do it for tonight's episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

2145
02:59:53,813 --> 02:59:55,895
[SPEAKER_18]: The final word of the show, one word to sum it all up.

2146
02:59:56,355 --> 03:00:01,158
[SPEAKER_18]: Next week, oh, next week we will not be live, but we will be doing something taped, so if you're around, tune in anyway.

2147
03:00:01,839 --> 03:00:03,020
[SPEAKER_18]: And of course, stay tuned to the podcast.

2148
03:00:03,040 --> 03:00:04,761
[SPEAKER_18]: We will have a new podcast one way or the other.

2149
03:00:04,781 --> 03:00:06,962
[SPEAKER_18]: We have to figure out how we're going to tape that, but we'll do that one way or the other.

2150
03:00:07,943 --> 03:00:09,364
[SPEAKER_18]: And that's that.

2151
03:00:09,404 --> 03:00:13,026
[SPEAKER_18]: Then we'll see you back here on New Year's Day for the first Orange Lounge Radio of 2006, live.

2152
03:00:13,807 --> 03:00:15,168
[SPEAKER_18]: And maybe some drinking going on.

2153
03:00:15,208 --> 03:00:16,409
[SPEAKER_18]: We'll see what happens, if you're good.

2154
03:00:18,361 --> 03:00:19,682
[SPEAKER_18]: We have a fun month ahead of us.

2155
03:00:20,162 --> 03:00:20,602
[SPEAKER_18]: We sure do.

2156
03:00:21,043 --> 03:00:22,203
[SPEAKER_18]: Alright, the final word of the show.

2157
03:00:22,343 --> 03:00:23,844
[SPEAKER_18]: One word to sum it all up.

2158
03:00:24,644 --> 03:00:25,645
[SPEAKER_18]: DarkSakura, what's it going to be?

2159
03:00:29,346 --> 03:00:34,229
[SPEAKER_05]: That does it for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio Live.
