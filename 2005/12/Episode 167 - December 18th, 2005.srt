1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:14,440
It was December 24th when Holla Zappin's the dog

2
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:17,040
When I see the man chillin' with his dog at the park

3
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:19,440
I had frozen very slowly with my heart full of fear

4
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:22,240
Looked at his dog on my card, it all rained here

5
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:24,640
I bet I was illy cool, the man had a beard

6
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:27,120
Had a bag full of pretty 12 o'clock at night

7
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:29,680
So I turned my head a second and the man was gone

8
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:32,180
But he must've dropped his wallet back dead on the lawn

9
00:00:32,180 --> 00:00:34,680
I picked the wallet up and then I took the pause

10
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:37,180
Took out the lights and then it closed that Santa Claus

11
00:00:37,180 --> 00:00:39,680
A million dollars in it cold, run it to G

12
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:42,180
Enough to buy a boat, magic claw with E

13
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:44,680
But I'd never steal the Santa, so that ain't right

14
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:47,180
So I was goin' home to matter back to him that night

15
00:00:47,180 --> 00:00:49,680
But when I got home I buzzed, cause under the trees

16
00:00:49,680 --> 00:01:07,640
It's Christmas time in Hollis, Queens Mom's cooking chicken in collard greens

17
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:12,400
Rice and stuff and macaroni and cheese And Santa put gifts under Christmas trees

18
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:17,400
Decorate the house with lights at night Snow's on the ground, snow white so bright

19
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:22,400
In the fireplace is the Yule log Beneath the mistletoe, S-E-J eggnog

20
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:28,400
The rhymes that you hear are the rhymes of Gerald But each and every year we bust Christmas Carols

21
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:47,800
I'm so loud and proud to hear it's Christmas time and we got this berry

22
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:52,800
Jack was chillin', the hawk is out And that's what Christmas is all about

23
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:57,800
The time is now, the place is here And the whole wide world is filled with cheer

24
00:01:57,800 --> 00:02:00,200
My name is MC with the mic in my hand

25
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:02,900
And I'm chillin' and coolin' just like a snowman

26
00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:05,200
So open your eyes, lend us an ear

27
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:09,200
We want to say Merry Christmas and Happy New Year!

28
00:02:35,200 --> 00:03:00,200
Down in the workshop, all the elves were making toys

29
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:04,200
For the good Gentile girls, and the good Gentile boys

30
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:08,200
When the boss busted in, nearly scared him half to death

31
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:12,200
Had a rifle in his hands, and cheap whiskey on his breath

32
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:16,200
From his beard to his boots, he was covered with ammo

33
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:20,200
Like a big, fat, drunk, disgruntled, yule-tied Rambo

34
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:24,200
And he smiled as he stared, with a twinkle in his eye

35
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:28,200
Merry Christmas to all, now you're all gonna die!

36
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:32,200
The night Santa went crazy

37
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:36,200
The night St. Nick went insane

38
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:40,200
Realized he'd been getting the raw meals

39
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:44,200
So finally Russell laughed in his brain

40
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:46,200
Well the workshop is gone now

41
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:48,200
He decided to vomit

42
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:50,200
Everywhere you'll find pieces

43
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:52,200
Of cupid and comet

44
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:54,200
And he tied up his helpers

45
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:56,200
And he held the elves hostage

46
00:03:56,200 --> 00:04:00,200
And he ground up for Rudolph into reindeer sausage

47
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:04,200
He got a Dancer and Brandler with an old German Luger

48
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:08,200
And he slapped a Stasher just like Freddy Krueger

49
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:12,200
And he picked up a flame thrower and he bought a few kisses

50
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:16,200
And he took a big bite and played a tape just like chicken

51
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:20,200
The night Santa went crazy

52
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:24,200
The night Chris creamed the windows

53
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:28,700
Now you can't hardly walk around the North Pole

54
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:32,700
Without stepping in reindeer's blood

55
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:39,200
There's a National Guard and the FBI

56
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:42,700
There's a van from the eye with the zoo

57
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:47,200
And hug out the third man round in the sky

58
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:51,700
And the bullets fly and the body comes rising

59
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:57,700
And everyone's dyin' to know, oh Santa, why?

60
00:04:57,700 --> 00:05:00,700
My, my, my, my, my, my

61
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:04,700
You used to be such a Charlie Guy

62
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:15,700
Yes, Virginia, now Santa's doin' time

63
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:19,700
In a federal prison for his infamous crime

64
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:23,700
Hey little friend, now, don't you cry no more tears

65
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:27,700
He'll be out with good behavior in seven hundred more years

66
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:31,700
But now, Mason's in therapy, and Donner's still nervous

67
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:35,700
And the elves all got jobs, working for the postal service

68
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:39,700
And the famous surprise, he's on the phone every night

69
00:05:39,700 --> 00:05:42,700
With a lawyer to negotiate the movie rights

70
00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:47,700
They talk about the night fan away craving

71
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:51,700
The night pain Nicholas slipped

72
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:55,700
Broke his back for some milk and coffee

73
00:05:55,700 --> 00:05:59,700
Felt to me like he was tired of getting sick

74
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:03,700
The night Santa went crazy

75
00:06:03,700 --> 00:06:07,700
The night pain Nick went insane

76
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:11,700
Realized he's just getting the raw deal

77
00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:15,700
Some finally must have snapped in his brain

78
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:18,700
Some fine man wants to snap in his brain

79
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:23,700
Tell ya, some fine man wants to snap

80
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:25,700
In his brain

81
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:54,700
The following live program is a special presentation of Orange Lounge Radio.

82
00:06:54,700 --> 00:07:11,100
Tonight on Orange Lounge Radio episode number 167, Merry Fucking Christmas, Happy Fucking

the Orange Lounge Radio Christmas Fest here tonight on the show, I'm so excited.

85
00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:25,820
that we might actually get canceled mid-show tonight.

86
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:26,940
It may happen, they might,

87
00:07:26,940 --> 00:07:31,300
Lion365 might finally pull the plug on us mid-show tonight.

88
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:33,780
And we'll talk about why that would happen

89
00:07:33,780 --> 00:07:36,340
all after this lovely introduction

90
00:07:36,340 --> 00:07:38,740
featuring that same introduction you've heard all year long,

91
00:07:38,740 --> 00:07:40,460
which we desperately need to change.

92
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:42,060
But you know you love it.

93
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:44,580
We'll be back with more Orange Lounge right after this.

94
00:07:44,580 --> 00:07:51,580
Orange Lounge Radio is presented in the TMI sound format.

95
00:08:14,580 --> 00:08:36,300
How come we'reésnt that big?

96
00:08:36,300 --> 00:08:42,300
This mommy talks radio like so much porn.

97
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:45,300
Oh, God!

98
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:48,300

00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:53,300

100
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:57,300
Orange Lounge may contain many four-letter words.

101
00:08:58,300 --> 00:09:01,300
Orange Lounge may contain a scene of nudity.

102
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:04,300
Orange Lounge may contain plenty of...

103
00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:07,980
Plenty of m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-cocky.

104
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:12,860
Just kidding, Orange Lounge Radio will not contain any of that in this episode.

105
00:09:12,860 --> 00:09:14,860
Well, isn't that special?

106
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:30,220

108
00:09:39,220 --> 00:09:41,720
You know, the chat room's saying that we forgot Festivus.

109
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:44,720
Fuck Festivus! Fuck it, right? And it's stupidly late.

110
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:51,720
Oh, hi! We are live! And this is episode number 167 for this December the 18th of 2005.

111
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:55,220
You know, I'm sorry, but it's not a holiday unless they have a greeting card for it.

112
00:09:55,220 --> 00:09:59,220
And I don't remember seeing any happy Festivus cards at the end.

113
00:09:59,220 --> 00:10:02,520
If Hallmark can make a dollar off of it, there's probably a card out there.

114
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:05,520
Can I do my intro? Uninterrupted, please, thank you.

115
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:09,720

She's on her way.

127
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:48,400
She wasn't in an accident, but she saw one or something.

128

We've replaced her with a ferret.

Yes, we've replaced her with a ferret.

Yeah, some people camped out overnight. Surprise! We don't have internet!

00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:52,500
Okay, this is Animal Crossing.

172
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:56,060
Everybody that has Animal Crossing can come join.

173
00:12:56,060 --> 00:12:59,180
Every time I play, I open the gates, but no one ever comes in, so.

174
00:12:59,180 --> 00:13:01,400
I have to talk about Animal Crossing when we come back.

175
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:02,900
We'll talk about all that stuff when we come back.

176
00:13:02,900 --> 00:13:03,900
Okay.

177
00:13:03,900 --> 00:13:04,900
Because I have issues with Animal Crossing.

178
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:05,900
I'll talk about that.

179
00:13:05,900 --> 00:13:10,300
So you need to PM your friend code to Loki so he can get you added.

180
00:13:10,300 --> 00:13:15,500
So PM Loki with your friend code and your name and your town name so he can get you added.

181
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:15,900
Yes.

182
00:13:15,900 --> 00:13:17,900
Alright, and the NOLR town will be open very soon.

183
00:13:17,900 --> 00:13:18,300
Yes.

184
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:18,620
Alright.

185
00:13:20,620 --> 00:13:22,300
We'll be back after this quick introduction.

186
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:26,940
Now of course since you know it is the end of December, it is mandatory Silent Hill time.

187
00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:29,580
So we're going to play Silent Hill and some other winter classics.

188
00:13:30,380 --> 00:13:33,340
So hopefully you've been a good boy or girl this year and you're going to get lots of

189
00:13:33,340 --> 00:13:36,660
video games for christmas

190
00:13:36,660 --> 00:13:37,980
and if you haven't

191
00:13:37,980 --> 00:13:40,660
well then you know you'll be getting um...

192
00:13:40,660 --> 00:13:45,060
you'll be getting a computer virus i don't know

193
00:13:45,060 --> 00:13:46,700
we'll be back after this with more

194
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:49,440
and i'm gonna talk about why we're getting canceled mid-show tonight as as

195
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:50,060
well

196
00:13:50,060 --> 00:13:52,020
uh... like to spice fall

197
00:13:52,020 --> 00:13:54,080
out of our hands will probably come back

198
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:56,580
after this mandatory silent hill

199
00:13:56,580 --> 00:14:03,580
Merry freaking holidays to you.

200
00:14:26,580 --> 00:14:41,500
Tonight is the night for our love yous Wish we could have this feeling

201
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:51,500
You'll never hear, Christmas is here, Christmas is here

202
00:14:51,500 --> 00:15:00,500
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

203
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:06,500
Tonight, nightfall, I love you

204
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:12,500
And if you hold me near you

205
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:15,500
And you move my heart, baby

206
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:23,500
But tonight, the nightfall, I love you

207
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:27,500
There's no back and forth, nothing to fear

208
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:33,500
Are you strong and cruel as you seem?

209
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:58,180
Can you hear me from above Do you feel the pain of my heart

210
00:15:58,180 --> 00:16:06,180
Do you feel the pain inside of me?

211
00:16:06,180 --> 00:16:10,180
Was it true?

212
00:16:10,180 --> 00:16:17,180
Will you leave me in the air just in time?

213
00:16:17,180 --> 00:16:23,180
No one cares to stop

214
00:16:23,180 --> 00:16:28,180
Can you see me from above?

215
00:16:31,180 --> 00:16:36,180
Do you see my frozen memory?

216
00:16:36,180 --> 00:16:40,180
Set it down

217
00:16:40,180 --> 00:16:44,180
Let it be alone

218
00:16:44,180 --> 00:16:47,180
Silent child

219
00:16:47,180 --> 00:16:52,180
Staring all of us

220
00:16:52,180 --> 00:16:55,680
Let us not fake me

221
00:16:56,680 --> 00:17:00,680
Please give me brand new star of mine

222
00:17:01,180 --> 00:17:02,680
Just take it

223
00:17:03,180 --> 00:17:06,680
One for all

224
00:17:07,180 --> 00:17:09,680
Let us not fake me

225
00:17:11,180 --> 00:17:15,680
Please give me brand new moon yesterday

226
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:21,680
Let my body take my hand

227
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:31,680
Let's not face me

228
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:23,680
Oh

229
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:31,680
This is the end of the video, thank you for watching and see you in the next one.

230
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:23,680
This is the end of the video.

231
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:25,680
Thank you for watching.

232
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:27,680

233
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:38,680
Plus, she's having fun while at school and is

234
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:34,680
ripped away from this Brand mole,

235
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:40,680
On my coldest dream

236
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:44,680
Full of happiness

237
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:46,680
Hello

238
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:50,680
Hello, is this Schmidt?

239
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:52,680
No it's him

240
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:55,680
There, and he vascularizes

241
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:56,540
Hello

242
00:20:56,540 --> 00:20:57,340
Hello

243
00:20:57,340 --> 00:21:01,340
Hello, is this thing on? Testing? Testing one, two?

244
00:21:01,340 --> 00:21:05,340
I'm looking in the index, but I don't see anything for how to run a radio show.

245
00:21:05,340 --> 00:21:09,340
Hello? I don't understand this. Does this thing work?

246
00:21:09,340 --> 00:21:11,340
This thing reads like stereo instructions.

247
00:21:11,340 --> 00:21:14,340
Is this on? What the hell?

248
00:21:14,340 --> 00:21:18,340
Orange Lounge Radio. Broke-down ghetto bimani radio.

249
00:21:18,340 --> 00:21:20,340
What the f***?

250
00:21:20,340 --> 00:21:25,340
And in that commercial, you heard the lovely voice of Dark Soccer there, who's not here yet, but she's on her way.

251
00:21:25,340 --> 00:21:27,260
Now I'm getting a little concerned.

252
00:21:27,260 --> 00:21:28,880
She probably usually would be here by now.

253
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:30,580
I hope everything's going okay.

254
00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:34,580
I'm sure we'll get the full story as soon as she arrives, but as promised, I'm wrapped

255
00:21:34,580 --> 00:21:35,580
up in a blanket.

256
00:21:35,580 --> 00:21:38,180
I'm celebrating the holidays the best, the only way I know how.

257
00:21:38,180 --> 00:21:41,700
I'm wrapped up in a blanket, and I have a nice bottle of Guinness, actually.

258
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:45,420
I decided against vodka, I went for the Guinness, so I have a nice bottle of Guinness in one

259
00:21:45,420 --> 00:21:47,620
hand here.

260
00:21:47,620 --> 00:21:52,980
And I'm just thinking about some Yuletide greetings, which I'm sure I'll be rambling

261
00:21:52,980 --> 00:21:53,980
off a little later.

262
00:21:53,980 --> 00:21:54,700
uh...

263
00:21:54,700 --> 00:21:57,420

00:21:57,420 --> 00:22:00,340
well i want to know we get uh... has just left

265
00:22:00,340 --> 00:22:01,540

266
00:22:01,540 --> 00:22:05,260
well i think i think i think i think i think i think things are swinging in a

267
00:22:05,260 --> 00:22:06,060
lot of town

268
00:22:06,060 --> 00:22:09,400
you know you may have to add you add more friends code is a friend to codes

269
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:13,000
and don't forget as if you want to uh... given to a lot of time

270
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:16,980
head on over to our chat room at w w dot org entry dot com click on chat

271
00:22:16,980 --> 00:22:20,340
and then look you have a message with your friend cody i have a lot of them

272
00:22:20,340 --> 00:22:25,180
already. I mean, I have to look and see who's in here, but I have a lot of people already

273
00:22:25,180 --> 00:22:28,700
added that were posting in, like, forums and stuff.

274
00:22:28,700 --> 00:22:29,700
Oh, good.

275
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:31,060
So, let's see who we got here.

276
00:22:31,060 --> 00:22:33,300
Nah, I'll just take your word for it. You don't have to name them all out.

277
00:22:33,300 --> 00:22:34,300
Yeah.

278
00:22:34,300 --> 00:22:37,140
If they message you and, you know, want to know if they're on the list, you can tell

279
00:22:37,140 --> 00:22:41,060
them if they're in there or not. Now, are you close to maxing out your list just yet?

280
00:22:41,060 --> 00:22:43,140
Have you maxed out the list there on Animal Crossing?

281
00:22:43,140 --> 00:22:45,940
No. I've only got about seven people.

282
00:22:45,940 --> 00:22:53,940
I have Dan, I have Milti, Black Lab, Jason, Harold, you, and Jamie.

283
00:22:53,940 --> 00:22:59,460
You know, I haven't touched Animal Crossing in probably about five days now, which is

284
00:22:59,460 --> 00:23:02,260
kind of sad because I was all into Animal Crossing.

285
00:23:02,260 --> 00:23:07,220
I was so up and ready to play Animal Crossing, and I was digging all around town trying to

286
00:23:07,220 --> 00:23:14,100
find a copy of Animal Crossing, and I went everywhere I could trying to get a copy of

287
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:19,180
animal crossing and um trying to get it early and then I finally picked it up I

288
00:23:19,180 --> 00:23:22,900
played it for three days and then never played it again do you know why I didn't

289
00:23:22,900 --> 00:23:26,060
play it again why because I bought a copy of Final Fantasy 4 advanced and

290
00:23:26,060 --> 00:23:30,180
that's all I've been playing everything I've been playing dark soccer is here I

291
00:23:30,180 --> 00:23:33,460
was starting to get a little worried how Mike's over there how you doing my

292
00:23:33,460 --> 00:23:40,420
friend you need to be on mother nature can bite my abundant ass what your

293
00:23:40,420 --> 00:23:43,140
abundant ass. What happened here? You want to sit, honey?

294
00:23:43,140 --> 00:23:50,420
Okay, alright. Alright, anyway. We'll talk about our weekend day is usually how we start

295
00:23:50,420 --> 00:23:54,680
off the show. Since Dark Soccer is getting situated, we'll go over to Loki and see. Loki,

296
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:56,820
how was your week? How was your day?

297
00:23:56,820 --> 00:24:04,140
My weekend day, pretty uneventful. Just still been fighting the cold. This week we actually

298
00:24:04,140 --> 00:24:09,660
found out though that we're going to get a lot of time off. They're giving us the Friday

299
00:24:09,660 --> 00:24:15,300
and Monday, um, you know, around Christmas and New Year's. So actually, this next week

300
00:24:15,300 --> 00:24:21,260
I work four days and the week after I work three days. So that rocks. Must be nice. Must

301
00:24:21,260 --> 00:24:28,980
be nice. And a $250 gift card for cash. Um, other than that, I've just been playing a

302
00:24:28,980 --> 00:24:34,580
lot of Animal Crossing, actually. Not too much in the 360 stuff, just because I hate

303
00:24:34,580 --> 00:24:38,780
having to set it up and take it back down because I take it to work. But at work we've

304
00:24:38,780 --> 00:24:42,740
We've been playing four-player deathmatches in Call of Duty 2, as well as Grand Theft

305
00:24:42,740 --> 00:24:45,180
Auto, or Liberty City Stories.

306
00:24:45,180 --> 00:24:46,820
So it's been a nice mix of stuff.

307
00:24:46,820 --> 00:24:50,380
We got another person in on Liberty City Stories now for five.

308
00:24:50,380 --> 00:24:51,780
So it's really cool.

309
00:24:51,780 --> 00:24:56,300
And Animal Crossing, Nellie's been taking it to work and playing it.

310
00:24:56,300 --> 00:24:58,600
So I've been playing it as well.

311
00:24:58,600 --> 00:24:59,600
So it's kind of cool.

312
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:03,140
Can you do Friendly Fire on Call of Duty 2?

313
00:25:03,140 --> 00:25:05,560
Well, we play Deathmatch.

314
00:25:05,560 --> 00:25:08,300
So I suppose you could.

315
00:25:08,300 --> 00:25:11,880
In the single player mode though, because I was watching Xtopher play a demo on one

316
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:16,480
of those Xbox 360 kiosks at like Circuit City or whatever, and I kept telling him, shoot

317
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:19,240
that guy in the back of the head, shoot your friend in the back of the head, I want to

318
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:20,240
see blood, I want to see blood.

319
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:23,520
And like he said he was trying to do it, but it wouldn't work, but he might have just not

320
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:24,520
been doing it right.

321
00:25:24,520 --> 00:25:27,600
Sure, but I know that it's really fun, and I like the way that they do the maps where

322
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:32,760
they don't show where each player is, but when you fire your gun, a little blip goes

323
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:37,800
on your screen showing you which direction the sound came in, and that's really cool.

324
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:46,800
Um, but other than that, um, no, I've been trying to, I'm actually going to try to play some more games, you know, while, you know,

325
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:49,800
Let's see here.

326
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:54,800
Um, some more games while I'm, um, you know, on my breaks here.

327
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:57,800
But, um, yeah, it's been pretty cool. Just a lot of gaming.

328
00:25:57,800 --> 00:26:03,800
And, um, starting to get some of my gift stuff, you know, and, you know, I'm dead shopping finally.

329
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:08,800
How many days away till Christmas are we at now? Seven? Seven days till Christmas?

330
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:13,800
And I haven't started my shopping yet. I'd just like to point that out. I've not started my Christmas shopping yet.

331
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:18,800
I've got stuff related to topics we'll be talking about later.

332
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:23,800
I have to laugh about certain things. We'll get to it later. It's just good.

333
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:28,800
If we get to it later. Now here's the thing. I was talking about in the beginning of the show

334
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:36,360
365 may well cancel us mid-show tonight. What's actually going on is that live 365

335
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:41,040
is doing rotating outages and they've been doing them all weekend and we think

336
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:46,800
we've missed it for tonight but we're not sure. So if kids at 8 o'clock the

337
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:50,940
station goes down, we ain't coming back tonight because live 365 is doing

338
00:26:50,940 --> 00:26:53,220
rotating outages. I don't know what the hell they're doing. They're moving their

339
00:26:53,220 --> 00:26:57,760
servers to a new thing, a bigger, better, stronger, faster, harder server. I don't

340
00:26:57,760 --> 00:26:58,760
what it is.

341
00:26:58,760 --> 00:26:59,760
We need to move them to Sweden.

342
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:03,500
So whatever they're doing, they're moving their servers, and if we happen to be on one

343
00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:07,240
of the lucky servers that's getting moved tonight, we will be off the air at eight o'clock.

344
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:10,540
So if the show goes down at eight o'clock, we ain't coming back.

345
00:27:10,540 --> 00:27:11,540
So sorry.

346
00:27:11,540 --> 00:27:16,480
But hey, life sucks sometimes, and Christmas sucks when you've been bad.

347
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:21,480
So anyway.

348
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:22,480
Where are we at show-wise?

349
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:23,480
I'm sorry.

350
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:24,480
I've lost my train of thought.

351
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:25,480
We're doing my week with a mouthful of burrito.

352
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:26,480
Oh, okay.

353
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:27,480
How was your week?

354
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:31,480
her weekend day is going to get a lot better

355
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:35,480
I've been trying to get this forever, this was going to be a wedding gift

356
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:39,480
now it's actually a Christmas present

357
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:43,480
I got the last one, the actual display model

358
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:47,480
I have purple lacrosse, that means Dan doesn't get to play the PSP anymore

359
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:51,480
did that actually come out?

360
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:55,480
yes

361
00:27:55,480 --> 00:27:59,480
By the way, good Christmas etiquette, leaving the price tag on there. That's smooth move.

362
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:02,480
It's a display model, what can I say? That's why it's open, too.

363
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:05,480
Oh, it looks cute! I thought this was going to be a darker game.

364
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:07,480
No! It's a cutie game.

365
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:09,480
Oh, it's cute. Oh, shit!

366
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:10,480
Shouldn't they try this?

367
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:12,480
I already broke the fucking thing!

368
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:14,480
I am happy I have a ball of gold.

369
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:15,480
Good job!

370
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:16,480
Thank you.

371
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:17,480
Happy happy.

372
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:21,480
That's awesome. I'm going to have your present at the end of the week because I didn't go shopping last week as I had finals.

373
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:22,480
Ah, that's alright.

374
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:23,480
Oh, and this would be your week and your day.

375
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:29,040
Yes, finals kicked my ass, however, I got feedback on my second to last Illustrator

376
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:33,280
project and I made a 95 on it, because I'm awesome.

377
00:28:33,280 --> 00:28:37,280
You said that my Silent Hill cover looked really nice.

378
00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:38,800
I haven't got my grade on it yet.

379
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:43,600
I got full points from my Dreamweaver project and I haven't got the results back of my World

380
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:44,600
Geography final.

381
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:47,920
Did you link the Silent Hill thingy bobber in chat?

382
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:48,920
Because it was actually really good.

383
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:52,720
Like, it's something that I could see actually being used, like, on a Playstation type cover.

384
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:57,980
I linked it in my live journal, but I'll link it in the chat room when I'm done with my

385
00:28:57,980 --> 00:28:58,980
thing.

386
00:28:58,980 --> 00:29:01,900
There's not everybody in chat that stalks you, LJ-wise, so you should probably link

387
00:29:01,900 --> 00:29:02,900
that.

388
00:29:02,900 --> 00:29:08,540
Well, I also am friends only, because I care who reads my journal.

389
00:29:08,540 --> 00:29:14,320
Well, yeah, I'm friends only for the fact that I don't want, just because of my nature

390
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:19,820
of my day job, I don't want folks finding me unless I'm okay with it.

391
00:29:19,820 --> 00:29:26,100
I had to fight the rain tonight because it was just really nasty.

392
00:29:26,100 --> 00:29:29,780
I was sick before I left home, really icky.

393
00:29:29,780 --> 00:29:34,300
And then I had to pass an accident, and then I had to go to Starbucks and get a latte.

394
00:29:34,300 --> 00:29:35,980
I picked up brownie bites for everybody.

395
00:29:35,980 --> 00:29:39,420
Oh yeah, I wanted a brownie bite, but I had to pass because I was in mid-sentence earlier.

396
00:29:39,420 --> 00:29:40,420
Oh, right on.

397
00:29:40,420 --> 00:29:41,420
And, um, no?

398
00:29:41,420 --> 00:29:44,420
I don't think they have nuts.

399
00:29:44,420 --> 00:29:45,420
I didn't know what they were.

400
00:29:45,420 --> 00:29:50,700
Well, I will have to eat one and see if they have nuts in them.

401
00:29:50,700 --> 00:29:52,700
These are nut-free, my friend.

402
00:29:52,700 --> 00:29:54,780
They are the nutless wonder.

403
00:29:54,780 --> 00:29:58,500
Just like, never mind.

404
00:29:58,500 --> 00:30:00,500
A fitting meal.

405
00:30:00,500 --> 00:30:11,540
But I also got DJ KK last night, which is the KK Eurobeat song, while I was watching

406
00:30:11,540 --> 00:30:12,540
Stargate.

407
00:30:12,540 --> 00:30:16,940
Now, actually, Loki has OLR town open tonight for our listeners to join in.

408
00:30:16,940 --> 00:30:20,540
Okay, you have the little brat lost in your town, and I have the mama in my town.

409
00:30:20,540 --> 00:30:23,340
Yes, I've been trying to get...yeah.

410
00:30:23,340 --> 00:30:27,140
Okay, so we'll have to fix that at some point tonight. Reunite baby and mama.

411
00:30:27,140 --> 00:30:30,240
I have to find the baby, because baby appears every now and then.

412
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:34,340
Okay, well I know where mama is, so I'll go to your town and rescue the baby.

413
00:30:34,340 --> 00:30:38,740
Mmm, I think Dark Sakura put something trippy in these brownies,

414
00:30:38,740 --> 00:30:40,340
because I'm feeling all warm and fuzzy.

415
00:30:40,340 --> 00:30:42,340
That would be the stuff at Starbucks.

416
00:30:42,340 --> 00:30:44,340
No, no, wait. That's the Guinness.

417
00:30:44,340 --> 00:30:47,340
Yeah, I can't have that as I'm going to be driving tonight.

418
00:30:47,340 --> 00:30:51,340
And I may have jury duty tomorrow, which I hope I do so that I don't have to go to work.

419
00:30:51,340 --> 00:30:54,340
Merry Christmas, you get jury duty. How did that happen?

420
00:30:54,340 --> 00:30:57,340
Well, because I missed it the last time, and I called back to reschedule, and I said,

421
00:30:57,340 --> 00:31:01,340
Yeah, but I'm in school. They're like, Okay, well, we'll just schedule you for the week after your finals.

422
00:31:01,340 --> 00:31:04,340
And I hope I have it, because I don't want to go to work.

423
00:31:04,340 --> 00:31:06,340
Does your work pay you when you get jury duty?

424
00:31:06,340 --> 00:31:06,340
Yes.

425
00:31:06,340 --> 00:31:07,340
Isn't that the best?

426
00:31:07,340 --> 00:31:09,340
I work for a bank!

427
00:31:09,340 --> 00:31:11,340
Hallelujah!

428
00:31:11,340 --> 00:31:16,340
My work pays for it, too, and I've been praying to get jury duty, just to see what would happen.

429
00:31:16,340 --> 00:31:20,340
I just want to go hang out in there and wait for them to pick me up, so I'll play Animal Crossing.

430
00:31:20,340 --> 00:31:26,340
And then, um, when I get picked, I want to sit on, like, a really nasty case.

431
00:31:26,340 --> 00:31:27,340
Because I'd love...

432
00:31:27,340 --> 00:31:29,340
Like murder? Like double murder?

433
00:31:29,340 --> 00:31:33,340
Not a double murder, but I'd like to get on, like, a suicide case.

434
00:31:33,340 --> 00:31:36,340
Wait, how do suicide cases go to trial?

435
00:31:36,340 --> 00:31:39,340
Because they have to prove it's a suicide for some.

436
00:31:39,340 --> 00:31:40,340
Oh. But with a jury trial?

437
00:31:40,340 --> 00:31:41,340
jury trial?

438
00:31:41,340 --> 00:31:42,340
Yeah.

439
00:31:42,340 --> 00:31:44,340
Did you mean to kill yourself, corpse?

440
00:31:44,340 --> 00:31:45,340
Well, no.

441
00:31:45,340 --> 00:31:46,340
Poke it with a stick.

442
00:31:46,340 --> 00:31:48,800
There's those ones where they need to prove if it's suicide or murder.

443
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:56,900
I like those kind, but I don't like just the straight-up, uh, hack you, arr, arr, die.

444
00:31:56,900 --> 00:32:00,620
I want to get in on a case because I, you know, I should have been a lawyer except I'm

445
00:32:00,620 --> 00:32:06,540
too, you know, lazy, but I wanted, I love studying the whole process.

446
00:32:06,540 --> 00:32:07,540
I like seeing it in action.

447
00:32:07,540 --> 00:32:08,540
I love watching court TV.

448
00:32:08,540 --> 00:32:10,780
are you going to get out there and if they ask you

449
00:32:10,780 --> 00:32:14,460
uh... now dark soccer of course that's not what they'd say they'd say jamie

450
00:32:14,460 --> 00:32:20,500
are you a supporter of the death penalty and you're going to get up there and say I AM THE DEATH PENALTY

451
00:32:20,500 --> 00:32:26,100
GUNS DON'T KILL PEOPLE! I DO!

452
00:32:26,100 --> 00:32:30,180
I support the NRA. Well you know the death penalty in the state we live in in California

453
00:32:30,180 --> 00:32:32,260
huge issue right now because the Tukey

454
00:32:32,260 --> 00:32:37,420
they did the thing to Tukey and now everybody's all

455
00:32:37,420 --> 00:32:41,980
all death penalty death penalty rah rah rah so inevitably if it is a murder case

456
00:32:41,980 --> 00:32:49,820
I have the solution. That's funny. Inmate battle royale. Took all the fuckers on an island. That was a movie.

457
00:32:49,820 --> 00:32:54,220
We played Leona. What was it no escape? And he gets off the island at the end if I

458
00:32:54,220 --> 00:32:57,100
remember sorry if this is a spoiler if I remember right he gets off to the island

459
00:32:57,100 --> 00:33:01,460
at the end. I think. I don't know if I want I don't know if I want Tukey living

460
00:33:01,460 --> 00:33:08,580
next door. I think that it would solve a problem. And then the inmate where they don't get their

461
00:33:08,580 --> 00:33:13,220
freedom that they get a much nicer jail cell. And then they have to defend their title the

462
00:33:13,220 --> 00:33:18,580
next year. You're evil. Someone snuck into my town and dropped fruit at my feet. Oh,

463
00:33:18,580 --> 00:33:27,740
that's nice. Yes. No, I'm not. I'm thinking about overpopulation in the jail cells and

464
00:33:27,740 --> 00:33:34,460
cutting down cost. I'm a penny saver. I'm frugal. You know, they should vote for me

465
00:33:34,460 --> 00:33:39,340
because, you know, I would kill more people and save you more money.

466
00:33:39,340 --> 00:33:43,640
You know, I just saw a meme on LiveJournal, which is the order of the presidency or something

467
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:48,540
like that, where you can add your name to the list to be in line to be president. I'll

468
00:33:48,540 --> 00:33:51,500
have to give you a link so you can add your name. I think they're on something like 5100.

469
00:33:51,500 --> 00:33:56,340
So if you could kill the other 5100 people, which isn't very many when you consider the

470
00:33:56,340 --> 00:34:00,300
population of the U.S., you, Ms. Dark Soccer, could be president of the U.S.

471
00:34:00,300 --> 00:34:03,100
That's because I'm not 40.

472
00:34:03,100 --> 00:34:05,740
Apparently they've thrown that out the door in this thing.

473
00:34:05,740 --> 00:34:07,740
It's 35, but yes.

474
00:34:07,740 --> 00:34:08,740
35, yes.

475
00:34:08,740 --> 00:34:10,420
That's a few years off.

476
00:34:10,420 --> 00:34:14,020
Oh, oh, oh, oh, I did learn another thing.

477
00:34:14,020 --> 00:34:19,020
Because my friend was DJing at Rapture on Friday, I ended up going out to the club,

478
00:34:19,020 --> 00:34:22,540
which I probably shouldn't have done in hindsight because I was shaking by the time we got back

479
00:34:22,540 --> 00:34:23,540
in my car.

480
00:34:23,540 --> 00:34:25,340
I was so sick.

481
00:34:25,340 --> 00:34:34,780
But I ended up, he played some excellent stuff, like all the old classics, he was playing

482
00:34:34,780 --> 00:34:39,260
The Cure, he was playing Depeche, but he played Kiss at like a golf club.

483
00:34:39,260 --> 00:34:42,180
Not Kiss, why am I saying that?

484
00:34:42,180 --> 00:34:45,180
I meant The Purple One.

485
00:34:45,180 --> 00:34:46,180
Prince?

486
00:34:46,180 --> 00:34:49,180
Because I was singing Kiss, but he played another song.

487
00:34:49,180 --> 00:34:50,180
Purple Way?

488
00:34:50,180 --> 00:34:53,700
Or did he play When Doves Cry, because I think that's my favorite Prince song.

489
00:34:53,700 --> 00:34:56,860
no he played something else. Or Kiss. I like Kiss too.

490
00:34:56,860 --> 00:35:00,460
But don't have to be beautiful.

491
00:35:00,460 --> 00:35:07,020
Anyway, and the rest of my week has been

492
00:35:07,020 --> 00:35:10,660
recovering from the plague.

493
00:35:10,660 --> 00:35:14,620
And you are on the other side of the plague now? Hopefully, but

494
00:35:14,620 --> 00:35:18,620
I don't know. I actually took my double dose of Vicodin last night

495
00:35:18,620 --> 00:35:22,220
so that I would sleep through the night and I couldn't get to sleep

496
00:35:22,220 --> 00:35:26,540
with like two shots of my Vicodin syrup in me so I stayed up and finally I'm just like

497
00:35:26,540 --> 00:35:30,540
shit it's been three hours that I took it so I took another dose and then went and laid down

498
00:35:30,540 --> 00:35:39,500
at 4 30 and woke up at three so yeah I slept most of the day. Let's see my week and my day my week

499
00:35:39,500 --> 00:35:44,540
has been very very busy I've just been kind of going out and doing a lot of things I went to

500
00:35:44,540 --> 00:35:51,180
the movies I went with Xtifer and and some friends to go see Sarah Silverman Jesus is Magic which is

501
00:35:51,180 --> 00:35:54,780
playing at our local art house movie and of course Sarah Silverman's the, you know,

502
00:35:54,780 --> 00:35:59,840
comic that likes to say fuck a lot. It was pretty funny. I'll let X differ talk

503
00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:05,580
about it more a little later in the show. And went out to eat a lot because I

504
00:36:05,580 --> 00:36:08,860
don't like cooking so I like to go out and eat things. Of course, as I was saying

505
00:36:08,860 --> 00:36:12,160
a little bit earlier in the program, I have not been playing a lot of Animal

506
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:15,580
Crossing because it got kicked aside for Final Fantasy IV Advance, which I

507
00:36:15,580 --> 00:36:20,700
picked up earlier in the week, and have not put down everything that I remember

508
00:36:20,700 --> 00:36:25,260
about that game from 14 years ago when I first played it is coming back to me and

509
00:36:25,260 --> 00:36:28,620
it's just that's all I care about right now so my village is gonna be filled

510
00:36:28,620 --> 00:36:31,580
with weeds because it's gonna have to wait until I beat Final Fantasy 4

511
00:36:31,580 --> 00:36:37,320
Advance and I'm making pretty good progress I'd say I'm about I don't know

512
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:40,220
how far I'm into the game about five hours and how long was I game about 30

513
00:36:40,220 --> 00:36:44,180
hours I'm about five hours into the game so as soon as I beat Final Fantasy 4

514
00:36:44,180 --> 00:36:47,420
Advance I'll be back into Animal Crossing again and then I'll join you

515
00:36:47,420 --> 00:36:52,420
guys know how our town. Your town's gonna be full of weed. I know it's gonna be hella

516
00:36:52,420 --> 00:36:56,620
full of weeds. Make sure you buy insurance. I have insurance, thankfully. I bought

517
00:36:56,620 --> 00:37:00,380
insurance from the dude when he came. But I have yet to have a single KK song.

518
00:37:00,380 --> 00:37:08,340
I've only paid off one loan on my house, so nothing there. Um, as far as the rest of my

519
00:37:08,340 --> 00:37:12,180
week goes, really not a whole lot noteworthy. Just um, I was gonna go to San

520
00:37:12,180 --> 00:37:15,500
Francisco yesterday, but the weather here has been kind of crappy here in

521
00:37:15,500 --> 00:37:19,320
California when starts when it starts raining in California people like

522
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:23,180
forget how to drive and they're not sure what to do especially when it starts

523
00:37:23,180 --> 00:37:26,840
raining hard and they start doing the flood watches like people go crazy like

524
00:37:26,840 --> 00:37:30,720
that's what's happening today and so crazy in fact that we you know we might

525
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:36,080
get we might we might go down mid show tonight because the hysteria you if the

526
00:37:36,080 --> 00:37:40,160
show disappears at eight o'clock you know that there was rioting going on in

527
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:45,560
the state capitol. So that's pretty much it for my week and my day. Not a whole

528
00:37:45,560 --> 00:37:52,080
lot else special. Anyway, so now, Loki, I want to talk about this before you go to

529
00:37:52,080 --> 00:37:55,160
a break and come back and start doing a little bit of, you know, bimani news. I

530
00:37:55,160 --> 00:37:59,400
want to talk about what happened with Xbox 360. What exactly happened that

531
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:02,280
you were kind of laughing about before the show started tonight? Basically, it was like

532
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:07,520
launch number two. The numbers for Best Buy leaked out to what they were gonna

533
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:12,160
yet, and they were doing a Sunday sale that was advertised, and basically they were going

534
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:16,960
to have like the same allocations as they had when the thing launched.

535
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:21,240
So people were camping out, and basically the source were said, do not pre-sell any

536
00:38:21,240 --> 00:38:27,680
of these, these are to be sold, do not open early, you know, these are for the advertisement.

537
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:33,000
Well, no, the Best Buy of course, they didn't listen to that, they pre-sold them some of

538
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:37,160
the nights before, and people camped out in the rain again for them, and a lot of people

539
00:38:37,160 --> 00:38:41,000
were disappointed because, oh, guess what, they sold them the night before and you waited

540
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:46,440
for nothing. But here, here's a nice compact laptop computer for cheap. You want this instead?

541
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:50,680
You know, it's like, so basically a nice bait and switch for a lot of the stores.

542
00:38:50,680 --> 00:38:55,600
So, so I, now I heard that they just plain didn't get them because we were at a Best

543
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:58,760
Buy here locally and I overheard a conversation about, yeah, all these people were camping

544
00:38:58,760 --> 00:39:03,280
out last night and, and I was like, oh, ha ha, they didn't get there. That's the moment

545
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:07,080
and I knew, oh haha, those Xbox 360s didn't show up. Some kid on the internet played a

546
00:39:07,080 --> 00:39:11,980
practical joke on everybody, you know. But, so they really did get more 360s, but they

547
00:39:11,980 --> 00:39:12,980
just did pre-sold them?

548
00:39:12,980 --> 00:39:16,120
They did, they did, they got a shipment in on Friday and they were supposed to hold them

549
00:39:16,120 --> 00:39:21,880
until the 18th. Now the thing that was also funny though, and because this sold out so

550
00:39:21,880 --> 00:39:27,020
quick, and they did get them. There was rumors that they did get them and people waiting

551
00:39:27,020 --> 00:39:31,560
in line and stuff, but this whole thing that they had pre-sold them, either the night before

552
00:39:31,560 --> 00:39:35,700
or just, you know, bad situation all over again.

553
00:39:35,700 --> 00:39:39,260
However, if you didn't get them on this day,

554
00:39:39,260 --> 00:39:42,960
never fear, they're getting another shipment on the 22nd.

555
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:45,400
Oh, enough talk. Just before Christmas.

556
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:48,800
Yes. You hope. Now, is this coming from the same source?

557
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:53,280
This is from the same source. And the source for this Best Buy stuff was an inside source.

558
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:54,160
And he's been

559
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:57,220
the one that's like providing, I think he's the guy that provides Kotaku with all their

560
00:39:57,220 --> 00:40:03,560
information of Best Buy stuff. It's all inside stuff. So pretty much, yeah, the next shipment's

561
00:40:03,560 --> 00:40:07,980
20 seconds, supposedly. I said some stores are getting them, but I noticed a lot of other

562
00:40:07,980 --> 00:40:11,420
stores, GameStop, are not getting their shipments in on time.

563
00:40:11,420 --> 00:40:15,140
Just in time for Christmas, the third shipment to Best Buy.

564
00:40:15,140 --> 00:40:17,420
I know it's not their fault, but it's just because, you know.

565
00:40:17,420 --> 00:40:20,100
And Microsoft's playing favorites. Yeah, they're playing favorites with Best

566
00:40:20,100 --> 00:40:23,620
Buy, so. Must be nice.

567
00:40:23,620 --> 00:40:27,140
Must be nice to be sucking the cock of Microsoft.

568
00:40:27,140 --> 00:40:28,140
All I got to say...

569
00:40:28,140 --> 00:40:32,940
Did you know Bill Gates and Melinda Gates, and Bono from YouTube, Persons of the Year

570
00:40:32,940 --> 00:40:33,940
for Time Magazine.

571
00:40:33,940 --> 00:40:34,940
Nice.

572
00:40:34,940 --> 00:40:35,940
Bill Gates.

573
00:40:35,940 --> 00:40:40,100
Big fat mug right there on the cover of Time Magazine, and nothing against Bill Gates.

574
00:40:40,100 --> 00:40:44,780
I know he didn't single handedly put out this Xbox 360 and cause a disaster, but he sure

575
00:40:44,780 --> 00:40:46,340
makes a good target.

576
00:40:46,340 --> 00:40:47,340
Yeah.

577
00:40:47,340 --> 00:40:51,140
Yeah, but he is living proof that geeks can succeed.

578
00:40:51,140 --> 00:40:56,140
And let me put it this way though, they really fucked up the whole launch of this system.

579
00:40:56,140 --> 00:40:59,140
I mean, it's all messed up.

580
00:40:59,140 --> 00:41:03,140
Well, what would you say to people, though, that say every launch is fucked up?

581
00:41:03,140 --> 00:41:07,140
There are some pretty fucked up launches out there, but I say the way they've been treating

582
00:41:07,140 --> 00:41:11,140
this one, it's been kind of, it's been really bad.

583
00:41:11,140 --> 00:41:12,140
Really bad.

584
00:41:12,140 --> 00:41:13,140
I mean...

585
00:41:13,140 --> 00:41:15,140
At least the 360s work, right?

586
00:41:15,140 --> 00:41:16,140
They do.

587
00:41:16,140 --> 00:41:17,140
They do work.

588
00:41:17,140 --> 00:41:21,140
So, I mean, the whole thing of, you know, they're all defective and stuff.

589
00:41:21,140 --> 00:41:24,140
Mine's, I've had mine crash once, and it wasn't heat-related.

590
00:41:24,140 --> 00:41:28,140
It's just a glitch in the game because of the crash.

591
00:41:28,140 --> 00:41:30,140
Because games were rushed?

592
00:41:30,140 --> 00:41:35,140
No, not necessarily. Games will crash every now and then when you try to do weird things with them.

593
00:41:35,140 --> 00:41:39,140
It just crashed for whatever reason.

594
00:41:39,140 --> 00:41:43,140
I haven't had it crash since then, and I've been satisfied with mine.

595
00:41:43,140 --> 00:41:48,140
It looks good on normal TVs and stuff, and don't really need a high-def TV.

596
00:41:48,140 --> 00:41:51,140
I mean, you can. I mean, definitely you'll get the best picture out of it,

597
00:41:51,140 --> 00:41:55,900
it's not going to suffer from having a, you know, a normal TV, playing even four-player

598
00:41:55,900 --> 00:41:58,340
death matches and stuff.

599
00:41:58,340 --> 00:42:01,460
Because it is higher-res, it's really nice.

600
00:42:01,460 --> 00:42:04,900
When the screen split four ways, you can still see very well.

601
00:42:04,900 --> 00:42:07,880
It's not like, you know, feeling all squashed and stuff.

602
00:42:07,880 --> 00:42:13,380
So I definitely, you know, think it's good that they're doing it, but I don't know.

603
00:42:13,380 --> 00:42:15,740
The way they did this whole launch is really fucked up.

604
00:42:15,740 --> 00:42:20,540
And hopefully, you know, Sony will learn what the PlayStation 3, you know, they won't mess

605
00:42:20,540 --> 00:42:25,260
that one up, but the way it looks right now, who knows when that thing's even going to

606
00:42:25,260 --> 00:42:29,500
launch, so. And that's going to be probably even more rushed to the market, if anything,

607
00:42:29,500 --> 00:42:30,820
so. It'll be interesting.

608
00:42:30,820 --> 00:42:37,540
Well, kids, we are going to take a quick break. Since we already did our winter-themed break

609
00:42:37,540 --> 00:42:41,660
there at the start of the show, we're going to just do some random stuff here. And when

610
00:42:41,660 --> 00:42:46,060
we come back from this break, we'll get a check on what's going on in OLR town. I believe

611
00:42:46,060 --> 00:42:51,700
that uh... dark soccer is on her way to reunite reunite mom and baby

612
00:42:51,700 --> 00:42:57,660
you're selling the baby? what are you doing?

613
00:42:57,660 --> 00:43:02,820
tom nook has offered six hundred bells for the baby so we will see what happens

614
00:43:02,820 --> 00:43:06,340
because tom nook would buy anything no no no it's crazy red

615
00:43:06,340 --> 00:43:10,380
because remember we sell children on the black market no that's right

616
00:43:10,380 --> 00:43:11,460
crazy man

617
00:43:11,460 --> 00:43:14,580
alright so we'll be back we're going to get a check on what's going on in noel art town

618
00:43:14,580 --> 00:43:18,940
We'll talk about some stuff going on in the music game world and plenty more when we come

619
00:44:44,580 --> 00:45:06,580
If you can't say goodbye, baby tell me why

620
00:45:06,580 --> 00:45:28,860
You say that love is not a possession You say that love leads back to sea

621
00:45:28,860 --> 00:45:36,500
You say we must give this devotion But you don't say that you love me

622
00:45:36,500 --> 00:45:39,500
Sometimes I wonder what I'm doing

623
00:45:39,500 --> 00:45:43,500
Sometimes I'm cold and serious

624
00:45:43,500 --> 00:45:47,500
But when you touch my body and close your eyes

625
00:45:47,500 --> 00:45:50,500
My little baby, I don't realize

626
00:45:50,500 --> 00:45:54,500
If you can say goodbye, baby, tell me why

627
00:45:54,500 --> 00:45:57,500
You don't wanna love me just like I do

628
00:45:57,500 --> 00:46:04,500
If you can say goodbye, tell me what I've got to do

629
00:46:04,500 --> 00:46:09,500
If you can say goodbye, baby tell me why

630
00:46:09,500 --> 00:46:12,500
You don't wanna love me, just like I do

631
00:46:12,500 --> 00:46:14,500
You can't say goodbye

632
00:46:14,500 --> 00:46:17,500
Tell me what I've got to do

633
00:46:44,500 --> 00:47:02,500
In the far real you gotta learn how to survive

634
00:47:02,500 --> 00:47:07,500
Cause you never know when it's your turn to take a dive

635
00:47:07,500 --> 00:47:13,500
So you go through each day with your eyes in the back of your head

636
00:47:13,500 --> 00:47:19,200
You'll never know, maybe you will be alive or beaten

637
00:47:20,700 --> 00:47:23,200
That is why, always have it

638
00:47:23,200 --> 00:47:25,800
You'll tell your midnight special

639
00:47:25,800 --> 00:47:28,500
Never leave, but without it

640
00:47:28,500 --> 00:47:31,000
Always better when the midnight special

641
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:33,500
In the dark, always free

642
00:47:33,500 --> 00:47:36,200
Never know, who you're gonna be

643
00:47:36,200 --> 00:47:41,800
You're my friend, you got me next to you

644
00:48:36,200 --> 00:48:43,200
Hey! Hey! Hey!

It is a call I call, and you're my all-out. I'll take you to the, call I call.

646
00:48:50,200 --> 00:48:56,200

647
00:49:26,200 --> 00:49:28,920
so uncensored

648
00:49:28,920 --> 00:49:31,420
that even Tom Brokaw could get a job with us.

649
00:49:31,420 --> 00:49:32,720
Uh, Mooch, uh,

00:49:35,600 --> 00:49:37,020
Tag, son.

652
00:49:37,020 --> 00:49:41,120
Welcome back, boys and girls, to Orange Lounge.

653
00:49:41,120 --> 00:49:43,880
In that break, you heard the Twilight Zone

654
00:49:43,880 --> 00:49:45,600
Midnight Special.

655
00:49:45,600 --> 00:49:47,520
If you can say goodbye.

656
00:49:47,520 --> 00:49:51,000
And the Rizlim remix, which people, for no good reason, were chatting about in our

657
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:51,800
chat room.

658
00:49:51,800 --> 00:49:55,560
So I thought I'd throw that in there. Yeah, the Rizlim remix kind of sucks. I don't know why people are

659
00:49:55,560 --> 00:49:58,960
talking about it but they were the original rhythm is so so much better I

660
00:49:58,960 --> 00:50:07,840
mean it's not that the rhythm remixes is awful but it is anyway of course you can

661
00:50:07,840 --> 00:50:11,320
join our chat room and get in on the fun www.orangeonstrader.com click on chat

662
00:50:11,320 --> 00:50:17,840
anything new going on in our town no nobody you know what everybody fucking

663
00:50:17,840 --> 00:50:23,040
wanted to say or was saying to us oh you got to do the Animal Crossing thing and

664
00:50:23,040 --> 00:50:27,200
open up your town a while visit. Here we are, Ghost Town. I think Tumbleweed is rolling

665
00:50:27,200 --> 00:50:32,240
by in OLR Town as we speak. However, Wonder Dog Harold did leave me quite a bit of fruit

666
00:50:32,240 --> 00:50:37,460
at my feet. Well that's good. Food is good. Lots of peaches and pears, so I'm very thankful

667
00:50:37,460 --> 00:50:45,720
for that. Good deal. But yeah, I've got like, a few people added, but no one's visiting.

668
00:50:45,720 --> 00:50:53,020
Well, we'll just see if this segment continues after this week. Bastard people. Have we read

669
00:51:23,020 --> 00:51:27,020
I guess Skype 2.0 adds webcam to it, or something?

670
00:51:27,020 --> 00:51:30,020
Of course, we threw away our webcam because it sucked.

671
00:51:30,020 --> 00:51:36,020
Hopefully we'll have a new one eventually, but for now we're not going to have that on Skype.

672
00:51:36,020 --> 00:51:40,020
But the new one still works with this old one that we have, right?

673
00:51:40,020 --> 00:51:43,020
We'll see. Hopefully it does, or else we're screwed.

674
00:51:43,020 --> 00:51:44,020
We're not going to be able to do Skypline.

675
00:51:44,020 --> 00:51:46,020
I remember last time we couldn't do Skypline, oh boy.

676
00:51:46,020 --> 00:51:48,020
That was bad.

677
00:51:48,020 --> 00:51:50,020
All right, so we are going to open up Skypline a little bit,

678
00:51:50,020 --> 00:51:54,540
But I do want to talk a little bit about some of the money news, some things going on out

679
00:51:54,540 --> 00:51:57,340
there in the world of the DDR.

680
00:51:57,340 --> 00:52:01,820
First things first, there is going to be a soundtrack coming out for DDR Festival and

681
00:52:01,820 --> 00:52:02,820
DDR Strike.

682
00:52:02,820 --> 00:52:06,580
It's kind of like a combined soundtrack, V-ware, I don't really know what the hell they're

683
00:52:06,580 --> 00:52:07,580
calling it.

684
00:52:07,580 --> 00:52:11,380
But it's going to have a lot of the tracks from Festival and Strike that weren't really

685
00:52:11,380 --> 00:52:14,140
in any other DDR game that came out in Japan.

686
00:52:14,140 --> 00:52:19,220
So you get some things that we got here in the US, such as Kids in America, Believe in

687
00:52:19,220 --> 00:52:26,020
bizarre love triangle. Then you get some things that only came out in other countries. Superstar.

688
00:52:26,020 --> 00:52:30,260
I guess just Superstar until you get into, of course, the DDR Strike music and a lot

689
00:52:30,260 --> 00:52:35,420
of the new stuff that's going to be there. Heaven is a Place on Earth, Let's Dance, You

690
00:52:35,420 --> 00:52:39,300
Sexy Thing, and some of the other stuff there. So I think it's kind of interesting. I don't

691
00:52:39,300 --> 00:52:42,700
think this song list is complete, though. I have a feeling there's going to be more

692
00:52:42,700 --> 00:52:49,060
to it. I don't think this is it. Something tells me, unless these are full versions,

693
00:52:49,060 --> 00:52:53,980
Which I doubt, because 21 full versions is an awful lot.

694
00:52:53,980 --> 00:52:56,900
So, I don't know.

695
00:52:56,900 --> 00:53:01,180
Very strange.

696
00:53:01,180 --> 00:53:04,700
Oh, you know what? And I would have to put your MAC address on here for you to

697
00:53:04,700 --> 00:53:05,780
access the Wi-Fi.

698
00:53:05,780 --> 00:53:09,540
So, and I can't do that because that'll boot all our listeners.

699
00:53:09,540 --> 00:53:13,260
Don't cry. That's alright, we can close the thing since no one's visiting.

700
00:53:13,260 --> 00:53:17,020
Close the damn gates, do your Wi-Fi thing, reunite mom and baby.

701
00:53:17,020 --> 00:53:18,280
happy happy

702
00:53:18,280 --> 00:53:19,800
all right

703
00:53:19,800 --> 00:53:21,740
so there's that i don't know it

704
00:53:21,740 --> 00:53:24,320
that sound actually not going to be worth the money to import

705
00:53:24,320 --> 00:53:30,520
unless you are a hardcore ddr collector type person

706
00:53:30,520 --> 00:53:31,920
if you

707
00:53:31,920 --> 00:53:34,100
if you're a hardcore

708
00:53:34,100 --> 00:53:38,120
ddr collector type person then uh...

709
00:53:38,120 --> 00:53:41,820
you want the soundtrack otherwise it really doesn't do you a lot of good

710
00:53:41,820 --> 00:53:44,540
because you can get the mp3s all over the internet

711
00:53:44,540 --> 00:53:46,720
illegally

712
00:53:46,720 --> 00:53:51,040
I think this is kind of funny because have you visited the music in every direction dot

713
00:53:51,040 --> 00:53:52,040
com website?

714
00:53:52,040 --> 00:53:57,080
They have a brand new flash game that you can play on the music in every direction website.

715
00:53:57,080 --> 00:54:01,000
And basically you go around and you collect these little icons but you try to avoid the

716
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:05,400
bad guy who's throwing like, I don't know, little like purple waves at you.

717
00:54:05,400 --> 00:54:12,000
And if you, I guess you store up these icons that you collect and then you unleash the

718
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:16,100
moves or if you're in the Beatmania stage you unleash your DJ power.

719
00:54:16,100 --> 00:54:21,320
And it slowly converts the background from something boring into like a nightclub or

720
00:54:21,320 --> 00:54:25,800
a dance club or a karaoke bar or something kind of cool like that.

721
00:54:25,800 --> 00:54:29,420
It's a little bit of a silly game, but what they're doing is that they're actually giving

722
00:54:29,420 --> 00:54:30,420
away prizes.

723
00:54:30,420 --> 00:54:33,500
If you get a high score, you can submit your score to the scoreboard, and they're giving

724
00:54:33,500 --> 00:54:34,500
away prizes.

725
00:54:34,500 --> 00:54:38,540
Not to the top scorer, but just people who submit their scores to the scoreboard.

726
00:54:38,540 --> 00:54:42,220
So it's a, you know, it's a random contest, which I think is kind of cool.

727
00:54:42,220 --> 00:54:45,420
But some of the people on there, oh my God, some of the scores are really high.

728
00:54:45,420 --> 00:54:48,540
Some of the people were playing this game into like level 35 and stuff.

729
00:54:48,540 --> 00:54:50,860
I got bored of this game after...

730
00:54:50,860 --> 00:54:55,220
I'm visiting the website right now, so here's some stuff in the background.

731
00:54:55,220 --> 00:54:58,980
I got kind of bored of it after like level 3, but I wanted to be able to show the folks

732
00:54:58,980 --> 00:55:00,580
in the studio what this is like.

733
00:55:00,580 --> 00:55:04,820
If you want to check out this game for yourself, it's called The Ultimate Club Promoter Online

734
00:55:04,820 --> 00:55:06,160
Game is what it's called.

735
00:55:06,160 --> 00:55:10,060
It's located at www.musicineverydirection.com.

736
00:55:10,060 --> 00:55:15,980
If you want to go directly to the game, go to musicineverydirection.com slash morphed.

737
00:55:15,980 --> 00:55:21,500
M O R P H E D. Why they're calling it morphed, I have no idea, maybe that's the company that

738
00:55:21,500 --> 00:55:26,380
wrote this, who knows. But the game is available for you to play.

739
00:55:26,380 --> 00:55:30,020
And here's our copy, downloaded here, because I've got to show this to you guys in studio

740
00:55:30,020 --> 00:55:31,900
because you'll think this is kind of funny here.

741
00:55:31,900 --> 00:55:35,460
So here you go, you're going to go get icons, and then you're going to unleash your dance

742
00:55:35,460 --> 00:55:41,780
move, and then you're gonna morph the club. So here I go, woo! I'm going around, and oop!

743
00:55:41,780 --> 00:55:48,900
I gotta dodge the bad guy there, and, what the hell is that? There's some arrows. There's

744
00:55:48,900 --> 00:55:52,060
a little bit of funky boogie playing in the background there. And watch, I'm gonna unleash

745
00:55:52,060 --> 00:55:59,060
and

746
00:55:59,680 --> 00:56:01,680
and

747
00:56:01,680 --> 00:56:06,680
i want to know what the suckers they got to be the captures for this

748
00:56:06,680 --> 00:56:10,680
anyway, you get the idea there

749
00:56:10,680 --> 00:56:13,560
it's a little silly

750
00:56:13,560 --> 00:56:16,160
enough funk boogie, shut up

751
00:56:16,160 --> 00:56:20,320
let's see what they're giving away here on this side, you have until january 30th 2006

752
00:56:20,320 --> 00:56:26,180
If you get first place, you get a copy of either Ultramix 3 or Xtreme 2, a copy of Karaoke

753
00:56:26,180 --> 00:56:35,400
Revolution Party, a t-shirt and CDs, which most of us already own, except for the t-shirt.

754
00:56:35,400 --> 00:56:38,800
And yeah, some of us even have the t-shirt, my t-shirt is BeatMania though, which I don't

755
00:56:38,800 --> 00:56:43,960
think is one of the prizes here, so that's kind of special.

756
00:56:43,960 --> 00:56:48,360
Second place, you get a copy of the game, you just don't get, what don't you get in

757
00:56:48,360 --> 00:56:49,360
the second place?

758
00:56:49,360 --> 00:56:53,440
you only get karaoke revolution party and in third place you just get the

759
00:56:53,440 --> 00:56:58,240
t-shirt and a CD nobody wins a date with now key no nobody wins a date with now

760
00:56:58,240 --> 00:57:03,080
okay I'm sorry to say check that out music in every direction calm and I'm

761
00:57:03,080 --> 00:57:08,400
being really nice you know I could have not told you about that I could have not

762
00:57:08,400 --> 00:57:12,120
told you about that and had more of a chance to win myself but we're nice here

763
00:57:12,120 --> 00:57:17,280
at orange lunch radio and we want to share with you guys what's going on

764
00:57:17,280 --> 00:57:28,880
also in the news hmm one other little thing here I wanted to say oh yes song

765
00:57:28,880 --> 00:57:39,800
pack 14 and song pack 26 are out on xbox live ultramix 3 ddr ultramix 3 song pack

766
00:57:39,800 --> 00:57:43,800
26 rumored to only be out there for a limited time it's going to disappear by

767
00:57:43,800 --> 00:57:48,960
the new year so song pack 26 is kind of like a Christmas present it's free it's

768
00:57:48,960 --> 00:57:56,480
one song it's a remix of love me do and it sucks it really sucks the steps are

769
00:57:56,480 --> 00:57:59,140
kind of fun though so it's definitely worth a download and hey it's free so

770
00:57:59,140 --> 00:58:09,480
you can't complain too much free song so anyway if you hit an animal crossing if

771
00:58:09,480 --> 00:58:12,200
you hit start you can do end the party or whatever and that'll that'll boot

772
00:58:12,200 --> 00:58:18,840
everybody from the village anyway song pack 14 song pack 14 is out as well and

773
00:58:18,840 --> 00:58:22,160
I'm doing this off the top of my head but it has a new never aka song in it it

774
00:58:22,160 --> 00:58:26,640
has I think it's called evolution it has goblin the couple but I thought it's

775
00:58:26,640 --> 00:58:30,380
funny because they don't credit goblin the couple to Tomosuke they credit it to

776
00:58:30,380 --> 00:58:34,080
DJ mojo or something like that I don't know they give it a different credit

777
00:58:34,080 --> 00:58:40,400
which I thought was weird also in there was a remix of ghost

778
00:58:40,400 --> 00:58:46,700
revival I want to say and some other crappy remix I think was in there too

779
00:58:46,700 --> 00:58:51,440
really nothing to scream about I haven't been too excited over these song packs

780
00:58:51,440 --> 00:58:56,240
but judging from the general reaction on DDR freak it seems to be getting an okay

781
00:58:56,240 --> 00:58:59,320
reception especially when it comes to the steps because I will give it that

782
00:58:59,320 --> 00:59:04,040
the steps are something kind of new and especially in one song that I played I

783
00:59:04,040 --> 00:59:08,860
want to say it was the ghost revival remix there's something about Brazilian

784
00:59:08,860 --> 00:59:11,900
the anthem. I don't know if that was a previous Pamani song or if that's just coming from

785
00:59:11,900 --> 00:59:17,580
nowhere. They all have some kind of interesting steps, like patterns you don't usually see

786
00:59:17,580 --> 00:59:21,660
in DDR, which is kind of phenomenal when you consider they've done hundreds and hundreds

787
00:59:21,660 --> 00:59:25,300
of DDR songs at this point, and, you know, there's only the four arrows. There's only

788
00:59:25,300 --> 00:59:29,620
so many different types of patterns you can do. You kind of see some different stuff happening

789
00:59:29,620 --> 00:59:36,020
in these songs, so you have that to look forward to to download. So check that out over on

790
00:59:36,020 --> 00:59:43,420
Xbox Live all right now I know you guys haven't had a chance to check out these

791
00:59:43,420 --> 00:59:47,060
song packs so I wouldn't expect that you already have this up or whatever so

792
00:59:47,060 --> 00:59:51,300
anyway we are going to open up our skype line that's over at www.orangehonestradio.com

01:00:31,340 --> 01:00:35,340
Hello, you're on Orange Lounge Radio. Hey, Sky, Ziggy here.

802
01:00:35,340 --> 01:00:37,340
Hey, how you doing? What's on your mind?

803
01:00:37,340 --> 01:00:42,340
Well, I just want to say, you know, Christmas is already coming in a week,

804
01:00:42,340 --> 01:00:47,340
and, you know, for Christians over there, Merry Christmas to everyone.

805
01:00:49,340 --> 01:00:54,340
And happy holidays to you too, my friend. Christmas, Hanukkah, Kwanzaa, Festivus,

806
01:00:54,340 --> 01:00:57,340
whatever the case may be for you folks out there.

807
01:00:57,340 --> 01:01:00,340
A politically correct winner to you.

808
01:01:00,340 --> 01:01:08,340
Have you ever watched the video of Love is Dreaminess from BeatMania US where L.E.D. is playing?

809
01:01:08,340 --> 01:01:11,340
What song again? Love is Feelin'?

810
01:01:11,340 --> 01:01:12,340
Love is Dreaminess.

811
01:01:12,340 --> 01:01:15,340
Oh, Love is Dreaminess. No, what is this about?

812
01:01:15,340 --> 01:01:22,340
Love is Dreaminess is confirmed for BeatMania US.

813
01:01:22,340 --> 01:01:27,700
okay right on um and um so what's this there's a video of him out there

814
01:01:27,700 --> 01:01:32,220
actually playing it on the internet or what's going on um yeah he did play a

815
01:01:32,220 --> 01:01:38,500
love is dream in this it's uh the player choose he plays on a player two side and

816
01:01:38,500 --> 01:01:45,060
he got an a for playing it even though it's 134k on his a score where did this

817
01:01:45,060 --> 01:01:48,220
video come from was a him playing on an arcade machine or is it him playing on

818
01:01:48,220 --> 01:01:52,620
BeatMania USA? Where was it taken? What is this going on here?

819
01:01:52,620 --> 01:01:59,180
I think somebody linked it on the Bemani style or VG Army where LED is playing BeatMania

820
01:01:59,180 --> 01:02:05,900
US with a 2DX controller. With one of the official ones?

821
01:02:05,900 --> 01:02:10,580
Yeah, the KOC one. Oh, that's pretty cool.

822
01:02:10,580 --> 01:02:16,000
And they haven't altered it or anything? I mean it's exactly as the Japanese one?

823
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:17,300
like video and everything?

824
01:02:17,300 --> 01:02:20,840
The video itself is exactly from the chapter

825
01:02:20,840 --> 01:02:24,540
I think you just cut out a little bit

826
01:02:24,540 --> 01:02:27,720
We were losing you a little bit there. I think you're back here. You're here for a

827
01:02:27,720 --> 01:02:30,980
minute there. Yeah, I can hear you. Okay, that's weird.

828
01:02:30,980 --> 01:02:36,500
Okay, so it has the same video and everything, so not a lot has changed there.

829
01:02:36,500 --> 01:02:38,700
Nothing's changed.

830
01:02:38,700 --> 01:02:39,520
Okay.

831
01:02:39,520 --> 01:02:40,480
So,

832
01:02:40,480 --> 01:02:43,780
the only thing that made me disappointed was, you know, the scoring, so I think they better

833
01:02:43,780 --> 01:02:44,960
tune that up

834
01:02:44,960 --> 01:02:45,860
to the standard

835
01:02:45,860 --> 01:02:48,520
Did it have the art at the end?

836
01:02:48,520 --> 01:02:52,580
Oh, the score result? No.

837
01:02:52,580 --> 01:02:57,100
Is it an early build of the game, or are they thinking it's the final build, or what?

838
01:02:57,100 --> 01:02:59,800
Some are semi-final build.

839
01:02:59,800 --> 01:03:01,140
Okay, interesting.

840
01:03:01,140 --> 01:03:03,220
It's a lot of purple interface.

841
01:03:03,220 --> 01:03:08,740
How are you feeling about BeatMania USA at this point?

842
01:03:08,740 --> 01:03:13,460
If they don't put any goalie background result videos, I mean the background

843
01:03:13,460 --> 01:03:22,460
of GoldieArts, I don't think I'll, you know, I'll think about it buying it or not.

844
01:03:22,460 --> 01:03:25,460
But what about those new controllers? You know, the rumor of the new controllers?

845
01:03:25,460 --> 01:03:28,460
Well, you probably have an arcade style, so what do you care, right?

846
01:03:28,460 --> 01:03:32,460
Well, KOC, not arcade style controller.

847
01:03:32,460 --> 01:03:38,460
But the rumor is that the Konami controller they're going to release here stateside is better than the one in Japan.

848
01:03:38,460 --> 01:03:42,460
I heard from Floatwalk that it's going to be spring-loaded.

849
01:03:42,460 --> 01:03:46,480
interesting you know it and of course all this kind of stuff is a matter of

850
01:03:46,480 --> 01:03:49,840
preference as well there's nothing to say that you know one is better than the

851
01:03:49,840 --> 01:03:55,660
other because that all kind of stuff is relative but I you know I I don't know I

852
01:03:55,660 --> 01:03:59,560
mean if it doesn't stick as much and they do a different kind of thing with

853
01:03:59,560 --> 01:04:03,480
the keys so the buttons don't stick you know they'll do that whole thing then or

854
01:04:03,480 --> 01:04:07,480
has a different slightly different look maybe to it or whatever it could be a

855
01:04:07,480 --> 01:04:15,040
more widely popular controller we'll see speaking of sticking uh-huh I just

856
01:04:15,040 --> 01:04:19,720
noticed on my controller like I don't exactly press the center of the key but

857
01:04:19,720 --> 01:04:23,400
I mostly on the white keys I press the top and then the black keys I press in

858
01:04:23,400 --> 01:04:27,520
the bottom and then there are like scratches that causes the you know

859
01:04:27,520 --> 01:04:33,680
discusses the stickiness you should do what I did with mine drop it off the top

860
01:04:33,680 --> 01:04:41,680
of the van, it's never broken. I can't imagine how that worked. That would kill me. It happened

861
01:04:41,680 --> 01:04:48,840
at Anime Expo 2001, I think, which is when I first got my controller, and I was unloading

862
01:04:48,840 --> 01:04:54,660
it from the van, it was stuck up at the very top, and it fell face down. But my controller

863
01:04:54,660 --> 01:05:00,400
has never stuck, except like one key, and I cleaned it and it worked. It's like my controller

864
01:05:00,400 --> 01:05:03,480
controller is the super controller of all 2DX controllers.

865
01:05:03,480 --> 01:05:07,320
I'm thinking the Virgin Mary lives in your controller or something because that's a miracle.

866
01:05:07,320 --> 01:05:10,420
I know, I should probably, you know, take a picture of the circuit board and say, look

867
01:05:10,420 --> 01:05:11,420
it's Jesus.

868
01:05:11,420 --> 01:05:13,420
Yeah, you really should.

869
01:05:13,420 --> 01:05:16,100
Have you ever tried the Vaseline mod, Darkspockada?

870
01:05:16,100 --> 01:05:17,160
To do what?

871
01:05:17,160 --> 01:05:18,160
The Vaseline mod?

872
01:05:18,160 --> 01:05:19,160
No, I haven't.

873
01:05:19,160 --> 01:05:22,340
All I've done is just clean the contacts.

874
01:05:22,340 --> 01:05:27,760
I've been doing it every, you know, every two weeks whenever I play 2DX.

875
01:05:27,760 --> 01:05:29,220
It works fine.

876
01:05:29,220 --> 01:05:33,660
I actually never had any problem with my, it was only one of them that stuck and that

877
01:05:33,660 --> 01:05:37,100
was the one that I would always slam on with my thumb.

878
01:05:37,100 --> 01:05:42,460
And I just, you know, rotated the keys, cleaned them out, worked just fine.

879
01:05:42,460 --> 01:05:45,500
Now what bothers me is playing on the shaved ones.

880
01:05:45,500 --> 01:05:47,100
I don't like shaved keys.

881
01:05:47,100 --> 01:05:48,100
That's irritating.

882
01:05:48,100 --> 01:05:52,460
And I don't actually like the ones where they put the little bit of rubber or foam under

883
01:05:52,460 --> 01:05:56,380
the key to press the contact up.

884
01:05:56,380 --> 01:05:57,860
It just doesn't, that's not comfortable.

885
01:05:57,860 --> 01:06:03,860
Sorry, it's just really funny because you guys are talking about putting Vaseline on your keys and shaving it, and all this other stuff.

886
01:06:03,860 --> 01:06:05,860
You are a pervert, Mr. Rob!

887
01:06:05,860 --> 01:06:10,860
My mind is going right to third grade. Can you actually use KY for the mod as well?

888
01:06:10,860 --> 01:06:13,860
I'm sure KY would work just as well as Vaseline.

889
01:06:16,860 --> 01:06:17,860
Sicko.

890
01:06:17,860 --> 01:06:21,860
I'm going to shave my controller and put KY all over it.

891
01:06:23,860 --> 01:06:26,860
Where's the ferret? I need to hit Rob with something.

892
01:06:26,860 --> 01:06:28,860
I was having a sit-in for you earlier.

893
01:06:28,860 --> 01:06:30,860
I had it.

894
01:06:30,860 --> 01:06:31,860
Anyway.

895
01:06:31,860 --> 01:06:33,860
Alright, so you know what?

896
01:06:33,860 --> 01:06:35,860
Apparently several people in our chat room went ass.

897
01:06:35,860 --> 01:06:39,860
Lube up those controllers, kids, and go to town.

898
01:06:39,860 --> 01:06:41,860
Yeah, you do have a lot of apples.

899
01:06:41,860 --> 01:06:42,860
Alright.

900
01:06:42,860 --> 01:06:44,860
Ziggy, I'm going to go ahead and let you go.

901
01:06:44,860 --> 01:06:45,860
Any final thoughts, my friend?

902
01:06:45,860 --> 01:06:50,860
Well, nothing much else to say, but hopefully next year you get a Skype 2.0

903
01:06:50,860 --> 01:06:53,860
so you can see what I really look like.

904
01:06:53,860 --> 01:07:06,860
I fear some of our listeners, I mean not you so much my friend, but some of our listeners might be listening to us in the nude, or God knows what. I don't know if I want that webcam on everybody. So we'll see.

905
01:07:06,860 --> 01:07:11,860
Alright my friend, I'm going to let you go so we can get to another call, okay?

906
01:07:11,860 --> 01:07:18,860
Yeah, and happy new year to Orange Lounge Radio in case we don't see each other.

907
01:07:18,860 --> 01:07:24,860
We're going to do something next week, but it's not going to be a live show, but we should be here in two weeks.

908
01:07:24,860 --> 01:07:28,860
I don't know. I have to talk to the crew about that when we're on a break or something.

909
01:07:28,860 --> 01:07:33,860
But happy new year to you as well. Have a good holiday season.

910
01:07:33,860 --> 01:07:36,860
Alright? Later. Take care. Bye.

911
01:07:36,860 --> 01:07:41,860
Alright, we're going to do one more call here, and then we're going to take a break and try to get some freaking air in here.

912
01:07:41,860 --> 01:07:45,860
I actually turned on the air conditioner, so the people out front are going to kill me because it's cold out front.

913
01:07:45,860 --> 01:07:47,620
But, oh well, they can deal.

914
01:07:47,620 --> 01:07:48,620
Let's go to another break here.

915
01:07:48,620 --> 01:07:50,980
What's those blankets and jackets for?

916
01:07:50,980 --> 01:07:51,980
Not a break.

917
01:07:51,980 --> 01:07:52,980
A call.

918
01:07:52,980 --> 01:07:53,980
Hi.

919
01:07:53,980 --> 01:07:54,980
You're on Horns Lawn's radio.

920
01:07:54,980 --> 01:07:55,980
Hello.

921
01:07:55,980 --> 01:07:56,980
Hi.

922
01:07:56,980 --> 01:07:57,980
Who's this?

923
01:07:57,980 --> 01:07:58,980
Xander from Florida.

924
01:07:58,980 --> 01:07:59,980
Hello, Xander from Florida.

925
01:07:59,980 --> 01:08:02,440
What's on your mind?

926
01:08:02,440 --> 01:08:03,440
Not a whole lot.

927
01:08:03,440 --> 01:08:08,420
I have an interesting anecdote, if you're willing to hear it.

928
01:08:08,420 --> 01:08:09,420
An anecdote.

929
01:08:09,420 --> 01:08:10,420
We haven't heard.

930
01:08:10,420 --> 01:08:11,420
Okay, sure.

931
01:08:11,420 --> 01:08:12,420
Why not?

932
01:08:12,420 --> 01:08:13,420
It's a short one, so don't worry.

933
01:08:13,420 --> 01:08:14,420
All right.

934
01:08:14,420 --> 01:08:15,420
What's on your mind?

935
01:08:15,420 --> 01:08:21,420
Okay. I'll admit, I'm a bit of a fanboy. Up to...

936
01:08:21,420 --> 01:08:25,420
A fanboy of Warner Bros. Radio? That's really sweet. Oh, I'm sorry. Fanboy for what?

937
01:08:25,420 --> 01:08:38,420
Sort of, but... I'm a bit of a Sony and Nintendo fanboy, and for a while I was kind of down on the PSP, but I had never played it. Right?

938
01:08:38,420 --> 01:08:39,420
Okay.

939
01:08:39,420 --> 01:08:45,420
Just reading stuff on the internet, it's like, oh yeah, I don't, you know, I don't like any games on it, PSP, scrap, blah, blah, blah.

940
01:08:45,420 --> 01:08:50,420
But, since I don't really have any kiosks, I never really got a chance to play it or anything.

941
01:08:50,420 --> 01:08:51,420
Okay.

942
01:08:51,420 --> 01:08:53,420
I mean, I'd seen it, but I never really got a chance to play it.

943
01:08:53,420 --> 01:09:04,420
So, let's see, two days ago, I was at this Christmas party with my friend, and he, he's a Nintendo fanboy, and he had a DS for a long time.

944
01:09:04,420 --> 01:09:11,420
And it broke for a second time somehow. He must be abusing that thing if it's breaking. I don't know how he's breaking it.

945
01:09:11,420 --> 01:09:17,420
He's shaving it and using KY apparently on it. Which you shouldn't do with a DS. You can do that with a 2DX controller.

946
01:09:17,420 --> 01:09:21,420
But please kids, do not shave and lube your DS. It does not like it.

947
01:09:21,420 --> 01:09:24,420
Anyways.

948
01:09:24,420 --> 01:09:30,420
If the animals in Animal Crossing are asking you to shave your DS, just seriously, it's time to go outdoors.

949
01:09:30,420 --> 01:09:33,420
It is time to go out in the real outdoors. I'm sorry, go ahead.

950
01:09:33,420 --> 01:09:43,340
that. It broke for the second time. Anyways, so he gets it and he brings it. He buys Tokobots

951
01:09:43,340 --> 01:09:49,300
and a few UMDs and stuff. So he brings it and I start playing it and I'm like, hey this

952
01:09:49,300 --> 01:09:59,220
is actually pretty fun. I mean, it doesn't necessarily have, it doesn't have all the

953
01:09:59,220 --> 01:10:04,240
games that are my taste but you know I don't expect that but I actually had some fun with

954
01:10:04,240 --> 01:10:14,480
it you know so I mean I guess really you shouldn't diss a system even if you look at the games

955
01:10:14,480 --> 01:10:21,800
and you look at the reviews and they all suck don't diss it until you play it seriously

956
01:10:21,800 --> 01:10:27,680
yeah unless it's an end gauge we need to add that however you draw some interesting parallels

957
01:10:27,680 --> 01:10:32,280
here because you could say the same thing about an Xbox 360, no?

958
01:10:32,280 --> 01:10:36,400
Well, I'm anti-Xbox. I know, I know, because you've said you've

959
01:10:36,400 --> 01:10:39,760
played Xbox, though, and I think that's the difference.

960
01:10:39,760 --> 01:10:43,360
What's interesting, what's interesting about this is, and I'm kind of just thinking out

961
01:10:43,360 --> 01:10:48,400
loud here, this is all kind of coming together as I'm sitting here talking, which is not

962
01:10:48,400 --> 01:10:53,360
a normal for me to just talk out my ass, but you got the PSP thing going on, right, and

963
01:10:53,360 --> 01:10:58,600
And the PSP, if you put the PSP and the DS side by side, and you want a system that is

964
01:10:58,600 --> 01:11:03,480
strictly the better gaming system, I honestly think it's the DS, is the better gaming system.

965
01:11:03,480 --> 01:11:06,200
But of course, it also depends on the kind of games you like.

966
01:11:06,200 --> 01:11:09,220
I mean, the DS has a different type of game, so you got that.

967
01:11:09,220 --> 01:11:17,080
But the PSP, where the PSP excels, is that, well yeah, the PSP is a sexy-ass system for

968
01:11:17,080 --> 01:11:21,160
one, but the PSP allows you to do so much else on it, especially when you consider this

969
01:11:21,160 --> 01:11:22,880
2.6 firmware upgrade.

970
01:11:22,880 --> 01:11:26,880
Okay, you either can upgrade your firmware or you don't upgrade your firmware.

971
01:11:26,880 --> 01:11:33,360
You can upgrade your firmware and get podcasts, and get pictures, and get the internet wirelessly,

972
01:11:33,360 --> 01:11:38,120
and get movies downloaded from the internet, and get MP3s so it's practically like having

973
01:11:38,120 --> 01:11:39,120
an iPod.

974
01:11:39,120 --> 01:11:49,340
Or you can not upgrade your firmware and get all the homebrew applications including homemade

975
01:11:49,340 --> 01:11:54,980
shooters and emulators, although if all you want to buy a portable system for is to play

976
01:11:54,980 --> 01:11:59,660
NES games, that's a whole other issue. So that's where the PSP really excels, is it

977
01:11:59,660 --> 01:12:04,180
being a multimedia system. Okay, so now flash forward to the current competition we've got

978
01:12:04,180 --> 01:12:11,020
going on here. Xbox 360, not a lot of great games for the Xbox 360 right now. Hopefully

979
01:12:11,020 --> 01:12:15,820
some good ones on the way. Hopefully some good ones on the way. But the Xbox 360 trying

980
01:12:15,820 --> 01:12:22,820
to sell itself as more as the multimedia thing, the little white box that Microsoft wants

981
01:12:22,820 --> 01:12:27,920
in every living room, which is very interesting because that is how I see Sony positioning

982
01:12:27,920 --> 01:12:32,740
itself as well. Sony wants to be that little box in everybody's living room as well. Nintendo

983
01:12:32,740 --> 01:12:40,340
says, no, we're still about the games. Nintendo says, fuck all that other shit. Fuck turning

984
01:12:40,340 --> 01:12:45,720
your console into an iPod. Fuck all that other crap. We want to do something new with games

985
01:12:45,720 --> 01:12:50,640
and we're going to take the games thing and go in a whole new direction and do these 3D

986
01:12:50,640 --> 01:12:55,480
crazy controllers and all this other stuff. So it's very interesting to see that Nintendo

987
01:12:55,480 --> 01:13:02,160
kind of continues to be about the game strictly, but about changing the game, as they're doing

988
01:13:02,160 --> 01:13:06,280
with DS and the touch innovation and as they're supposedly doing with Revolution. I don't

989
01:13:06,280 --> 01:13:10,680
know, it's kind of interesting. I think Iwata is a fucking genius. I think

990
01:13:10,680 --> 01:13:14,680
I think he's taken the company in a brilliant direction, in my opinion.

991
01:13:14,680 --> 01:13:16,680
Yes, but it is a big gamble as well.

992
01:13:16,680 --> 01:13:17,680
It is.

993
01:13:17,680 --> 01:13:22,680
But I think they don't really have anywhere else to go if they just keep trying to battle

994
01:13:22,680 --> 01:13:25,680
Sony and Microsoft on their grounds, they're going to lose.

995
01:13:25,680 --> 01:13:28,680
The revolution could crash and burn.

996
01:13:28,680 --> 01:13:34,680
It could be another end gauge and it wouldn't matter because they've still sold 50 gabillion Game Boys.

997
01:13:34,680 --> 01:13:39,680
I think gabillion is an actual number now because Nintendo has sold that many Game Boys in different forms.

998
01:13:39,680 --> 01:13:43,680
If you sell more Game Boys than PS2s, I think, something like that.

999
01:13:43,680 --> 01:13:48,000
Oh, I'm sure. I'm sure of it. Because just the fact that, you know, think about it, how

1000
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:51,760
many Game Boys have you bought? I bought the first Game Boy, then I bought

1001
01:13:51,760 --> 01:13:55,320
a Game Boy Color, and then I bought a Game Boy Advance, and then I bought a Game Boy

1002
01:13:55,320 --> 01:14:03,240
DS. So, I don't know. It's just interesting. I mean, Nintendo has dominated the handheld

1003
01:14:03,240 --> 01:14:07,360
market, and I really don't see anybody posing a real threat to that anytime soon, not even

1004
01:14:07,360 --> 01:14:12,700
the PSP the PSP is bringing in a new market in my opinion I don't think the

1005
01:14:12,700 --> 01:14:17,020
PSP is getting the same people that the Game Boy and DS is getting because it's

1006
01:14:17,020 --> 01:14:22,140
not a gaming system at heart right it's it's a system it's an entertainment on

1007
01:14:22,140 --> 01:14:26,500
the go system right and I'm getting yelled at in the chat room for calling

1008
01:14:26,500 --> 01:14:31,180
the DS a Game Boy okay it's not really a Game Boy technically the DS is not a

1009
01:14:31,180 --> 01:14:35,820
Game Boy but give me this it does have a Game Boy advanced slot right so that's

1010
01:14:35,820 --> 01:14:38,980
what a lot of people are considering when they buy a DS is, oh, this will play all my

1011
01:14:38,980 --> 01:14:43,740
Game Boy Advance games. So while it might not be a Game Boy, per se, and it doesn't

1012
01:14:43,740 --> 01:14:47,500
carry the Game Boy brand, it is the evolved form of the Game Boy.

1013
01:14:47,500 --> 01:14:51,260
But it still can't play Tetris. But it still can't play Tetris. Well, now,

1014
01:14:51,260 --> 01:14:55,320
but it could play if they re-release Tetris or whatever, and since they re-released Dr.

1015
01:14:55,320 --> 01:15:01,020
Mario and Puzzle League recently on one cartridge, did you notice they're not calling it Pokemon

1016
01:15:01,020 --> 01:15:03,340
Puzzle League? They're just calling it Puzzle League. I thought that was very interesting.

1017
01:15:03,340 --> 01:15:06,340
Let's just say we release that on one cartridge.

1018
01:15:06,340 --> 01:15:08,340
Has that come out over here?

1019
01:15:08,340 --> 01:15:11,340
I'm seeing ad banners for it on the internet, so I think it's out.

1020
01:15:11,340 --> 01:15:15,340
It's not a game I'm interested in because I actually have both games on other consoles.

1021
01:15:15,340 --> 01:15:17,340
It came out back in November.

1022
01:15:17,340 --> 01:15:20,340
Did it? But it's nothing that I really care about.

1023
01:15:20,340 --> 01:15:23,340
Yeah, I didn't notice either because I already have both those games.

1024
01:15:23,340 --> 01:15:25,340
But I'm sure it's a great Christmas title.

1025
01:15:25,340 --> 01:15:31,340
So, alright, anyway, Zander, appreciate the call.

1026
01:15:31,340 --> 01:15:35,980
I'm glad to hear that the PSP was, you know, you had a good experience with it because

1027
01:15:35,980 --> 01:15:40,620
that sucks to be a fanboy of something and then get really let down.

1028
01:15:40,620 --> 01:15:41,620
You know, you know what I mean?

1029
01:15:41,620 --> 01:15:46,820
And it's a bad thing to be a fanboy because, you know, if you just stick to one thing,

1030
01:15:46,820 --> 01:15:48,060
you'll never broaden your horizons.

1031
01:15:48,060 --> 01:15:51,620
Exactly, don't, don't, be careful when you get narrow-minded and especially in the case

1032
01:15:51,620 --> 01:15:52,680
of Microsoft.

1033
01:15:52,680 --> 01:15:55,160
When the Xbox first came out, I hated it.

1034
01:15:55,160 --> 01:15:59,760
I thought it was a crap system because, remember the golden rule of gaming, the system is only

1035
01:15:59,760 --> 01:16:01,400
as good as the games that are on it, right?

1036
01:16:01,400 --> 01:16:05,840
And the Xbox had nothing going for it until they started getting DDR, they started getting

1037
01:16:05,840 --> 01:16:10,320
Fable, they started getting Halo, and I like Halo, I know a lot of people don't, but they

1038
01:16:10,320 --> 01:16:16,080
started getting some more games that, I know, but they started reaching out into other areas

1039
01:16:16,080 --> 01:16:19,240
that weren't just sports and shooters, you know?

1040
01:16:19,240 --> 01:16:20,240
But that's just me.

1041
01:16:20,240 --> 01:16:21,240
They had a Buffy game?

1042
01:16:21,240 --> 01:16:22,920
And they did have a Buffy game.

1043
01:16:22,920 --> 01:16:23,920
Which is worth something.

1044
01:16:23,920 --> 01:16:26,660
All right, Xander, we gotta let you go so we can go to break, but thanks for calling

1045
01:16:26,660 --> 01:16:27,660
as always, okay?

1046
01:16:27,660 --> 01:16:28,660
Any other thoughts for listeners?

1047
01:16:28,660 --> 01:16:31,020
Uh, your taste in music still sucks.

1048
01:16:31,020 --> 01:16:32,020
I know.

1049
01:16:32,020 --> 01:16:36,120
But, uh, it's, I have a microphone and you don't, so that's, that's what it boils down

1050
01:16:36,120 --> 01:16:37,120
to.

1051
01:16:37,120 --> 01:16:38,120
All right, take care, buddy.

1052
01:16:38,120 --> 01:16:39,120
Okay.

1053
01:16:39,120 --> 01:16:40,120
Later.

1054
01:16:40,120 --> 01:16:41,640
Just for that, Xander's gonna start his own radio station.

1055
01:16:41,640 --> 01:16:44,380
It's gonna be Skye, Skye sucks.

1056
01:16:44,380 --> 01:16:45,380
A lot.

1057
01:16:45,380 --> 01:16:46,380
Hi, Extifer.

1058
01:16:46,380 --> 01:16:47,380
How are you?

1059
01:16:47,380 --> 01:16:48,380
Hi.

1060
01:16:48,380 --> 01:16:49,380
Hit him with the trout.

1061
01:16:49,380 --> 01:16:50,380
Do we have a microphone?

1062
01:16:50,380 --> 01:16:54,380
Hello?

1063
01:16:54,380 --> 01:16:58,380
I am fine, my friend.

1064
01:16:58,380 --> 01:17:02,380
We're going to Chipotle.

1065
01:17:02,380 --> 01:17:06,380
That's what I had for dinner.

1066
01:17:06,380 --> 01:17:10,380
It's fine, I like the coldness.

1067
01:17:10,380 --> 01:17:14,380
Yeah.

1068
01:17:14,380 --> 01:17:17,020
can leave the door open that's good did you want to do a movie review real quick

1069
01:17:17,020 --> 01:17:22,460
before you go are they waiting for you or what I could do a diet coke okay

1070
01:17:22,460 --> 01:17:29,740
anybody else want anything from Chipotle I want some hot beans no I don't know

1074
01:17:41,740 --> 01:17:45,040
make sure that we got your movie review in why would they pull the plug on you

1075
01:17:45,040 --> 01:17:52,460
um because we're letting you on the show because we eat through a feeding tube

1076
01:17:52,460 --> 01:17:59,980
okay that took me a minute but it was actually really funny it isn't anyway

1077
01:17:59,980 --> 01:18:06,140
there's a special place in how reserve just for Loki all right extra fur what

1078
01:18:06,140 --> 01:18:08,140
What did you see this week?

1079
01:18:08,140 --> 01:18:14,140
I saw Sarah Silverman's, um, something or other.

1080
01:18:14,140 --> 01:18:16,140
The Pussy? What did you see?

1081
01:18:16,140 --> 01:18:18,140
Yeah, what's it called? Jesus is Magic.

1082
01:18:18,140 --> 01:18:22,140
And she is officially now my favorite comedian.

1083
01:18:22,140 --> 01:18:26,140
Um, because she made jokes about waxed assholes.

1084
01:18:26,140 --> 01:18:31,140
And that was just like, so on my, you know, my level of humor.

1085
01:18:31,140 --> 01:18:35,380
Like I was just like, that is like me or whatever.

1086
01:18:35,380 --> 01:18:38,660
I'm like, she's just like so politically incorrect.

1087
01:18:38,660 --> 01:18:39,720
It's so great.

1088
01:18:39,720 --> 01:18:40,560
I love it.

1089
01:18:40,560 --> 01:18:42,620
Like how she makes fun of her, her heritage, you know,

1090
01:18:42,620 --> 01:18:45,660
and everything she talks about how like her,

1091
01:18:45,660 --> 01:18:47,540
her niece calls her up and she says,

1092
01:18:47,540 --> 01:18:49,700
I had to do a report on the Holocaust.

1093
01:18:49,700 --> 01:18:52,620
And she's like, she's like, you know,

1094
01:18:52,620 --> 01:18:55,860
60 million people died in that.

1095
01:18:55,860 --> 01:18:58,140
And Sarah Silverman's like, no,

1096
01:18:58,140 --> 01:19:00,340
there was 6 million people that died in that.

1097
01:19:00,340 --> 01:19:04,140
she's like and her niece is like no well what's the difference like that and she

1098
01:19:04,140 --> 01:19:13,780
goes well 60 million is forget is unforgivable if you're easily offended

1099
01:19:13,780 --> 01:19:17,620
do not see this movie yeah she's so funny is there ever everything is

1100
01:19:17,620 --> 01:19:22,780
nothing is off-limits she got she talks about black people Asians Jews women

1101
01:19:22,780 --> 01:19:29,780
9-11, Holocaust, AIDS, AIDS, American Airlines have a slogan.

1102
01:19:29,780 --> 01:19:31,780
Don't ruin all the jokes.

1103
01:19:31,780 --> 01:19:34,780
That one's the best because it'll make you like...

1104
01:19:34,780 --> 01:19:38,780
That offended people in the audience. I don't need you alienating our listeners.

1105
01:19:38,780 --> 01:19:40,780
You want to hear the parts of that joke?

1106
01:19:40,780 --> 01:19:46,780
I really don't care. Your listeners like me enough to know that I really don't care.

1107
01:19:46,780 --> 01:19:50,780
So it was a good movie. I really liked it.

1108
01:19:50,780 --> 01:19:58,780
The musical numbers were kind of weird, and then there was a weird masturbating scene in it, which was kind of weird, too.

1109
01:19:58,780 --> 01:20:00,780
It was really hot.

1110
01:20:00,780 --> 01:20:03,780
Otherwise, it was a good movie. Go see it.

1111
01:20:03,780 --> 01:20:06,780
You may want to wait for it to come out on video.

1112
01:20:06,780 --> 01:20:08,780
Two thumbs up.

1113
01:20:08,780 --> 01:20:14,780
Two cocks up and a flaccid... two cocks and a flaccid cock.

1114
01:20:14,780 --> 01:20:16,780
Wait, that's two cocks and a half.

1115
01:20:16,780 --> 01:20:18,780
Get out. Get out.

1116
01:20:18,780 --> 01:20:19,780
Two cocks and a puss...

1117
01:20:19,780 --> 01:20:21,780
Liz, this segment's over. Get out.

1118
01:20:21,780 --> 01:20:22,780
Alright.

1119
01:20:22,780 --> 01:20:27,780
What kind of ranking scale is that?

1120
01:20:27,780 --> 01:20:31,780
I give it two cocks and a pussy. It's a three-way.

1121
01:20:31,780 --> 01:20:32,780
It's a...

1122
01:20:32,780 --> 01:20:33,780
It's a three...

1123
01:20:33,780 --> 01:20:35,780
You're so weird.

1124
01:20:35,780 --> 01:20:36,780
Alright.

1125
01:20:36,780 --> 01:20:42,780
We're gonna go to a break, kids, and try to get some air, because we're dying in the hotbox.

1126
01:20:42,780 --> 01:20:45,780
And hopefully we'll be back and either the plug will get pulled on us...

1127
01:20:45,780 --> 01:20:46,780
Hotbox.

1128
01:20:46,780 --> 01:20:47,780
Shut up.

1129
01:20:47,780 --> 01:20:51,780
We'll be back after this with more Orange Lounge Radio.

1130
01:20:51,780 --> 01:20:54,780
Hopefully we'll be back after this with more Orange Lounge Radio.

1131
01:20:54,780 --> 01:21:12,880
And if you don't change you be crying boy cause something aint right

1132
01:21:42,880 --> 01:21:43,380
Who that is?

1133
01:21:43,380 --> 01:21:43,880
My baby mama

1134
01:21:43,880 --> 01:21:45,880
Now you got to think you said you was with your boys

1135
01:21:45,880 --> 01:21:47,880
But I saw you and Jenna so holin' to us

1136
01:21:47,880 --> 01:21:48,880
You know the girl that I'm talkin' about

1137
01:21:48,880 --> 01:21:50,880
That's right I'm calling you sorry but I

1138
01:21:50,880 --> 01:21:52,880
Not thinking about time that I put you in check

1139
01:21:52,880 --> 01:21:54,880
About who I'm taking at the local spa

1140
01:21:54,880 --> 01:21:55,880
So all you fellas this is just a game

1141
01:21:55,880 --> 01:21:57,880
Mackin' to the ladies tryna build the name

1142
01:21:57,880 --> 01:21:59,880
Wanna be a blud, tryna get a piece

1143
01:21:59,880 --> 01:22:01,880
I'll break your neck if I catch a disease

1144
01:22:01,880 --> 01:22:02,880
Round town soybeans like a farmer

1145
01:22:02,880 --> 01:22:04,880
You better beware your baby mama

1146
01:22:04,880 --> 01:22:05,880
Who that is?

1147
01:22:05,880 --> 01:22:06,880
My baby mama

1148
01:22:06,880 --> 01:22:07,880
No, who that is?

1149
01:22:07,880 --> 01:22:08,880
My baby mama

1150
01:22:08,880 --> 01:22:09,880
Now who that is?

1151
01:22:09,880 --> 01:22:10,880
My baby mama

1152
01:22:10,880 --> 01:22:11,880
No, who that is?

1153
01:22:11,880 --> 01:22:19,240
Who that is?

1154
01:22:41,880 --> 01:22:43,880
Oh

1155
01:23:41,880 --> 01:24:06,880
On a day like today, the whole world could change

1156
01:24:06,880 --> 01:24:13,880
The sun's gonna shine, shine through the rain

1157
01:24:13,880 --> 01:24:17,880
On a day like today

1158
01:24:17,880 --> 01:24:25,880
You never want to see the sun go down

1159
01:24:37,880 --> 01:24:44,880
Dreams always gotta be dreams, dreams, no one else could be

1160
01:24:44,880 --> 01:24:51,880
But you never know what might be coming for you and me

1161
01:24:51,880 --> 01:24:54,880
Yeah, it's gonna be

1162
01:24:54,880 --> 01:24:58,880
On a day like today

1163
01:24:58,880 --> 01:25:02,880
A whole world could change

1164
01:25:02,880 --> 01:25:06,880
You're gonna shine

1165
01:25:06,880 --> 01:25:09,880
Through the red

1166
01:25:09,880 --> 01:25:12,880
On a day like today

1167
01:25:12,880 --> 01:25:16,880
No, I won't complain

1168
01:25:16,880 --> 01:25:19,880
Great to see you

1169
01:25:19,880 --> 01:25:22,880
Great to see you

1170
01:25:22,880 --> 01:25:27,880
On a day like today

1171
01:25:27,880 --> 01:25:31,880
You never wanna see us

1172
01:25:31,880 --> 01:25:34,880
Jungle down

1173
01:26:04,880 --> 01:26:09,880
I want you now, my heart's on fire

1174
01:26:09,880 --> 01:26:11,880
And you know it, go, go, go

1175
01:26:11,880 --> 01:26:14,880
Into the dark of night

1176
01:26:14,880 --> 01:26:18,880
I'm for your love, I'm wanting your love

1177
01:26:18,880 --> 01:26:21,880
I know that you'll be there

1178
01:26:21,880 --> 01:26:25,880
I'm feeling good, I'm feeling fine

1179
01:26:25,880 --> 01:26:30,880
I want you now, I want you now

1180
01:26:30,880 --> 01:26:39,880
Don't believe, I don't do wrong Don't let me go, don't let me go

1181
01:26:39,880 --> 01:26:48,880
Baby, yeah, you love me so right Baby, yeah, you're holding my mind

1182
01:26:48,880 --> 01:26:53,880
I want you just to hold me And I'll bless you, love me always

1183
01:26:53,880 --> 01:26:57,880
I want you just to touch me I want to feel you near me

1184
01:26:57,880 --> 01:27:02,880
I want you, just to hold me, I know that you love me always

1185
01:27:02,880 --> 01:27:07,880
I want you, just to watch me, I love to feel inside your heart

1186
01:27:07,880 --> 01:27:14,880
And that break you heard inside your heart, by the way.

1187
01:27:37,880 --> 01:27:42,280
Akira Yamaka, before that a day like today from In the Groove, DJ Simon with

1188
01:27:42,280 --> 01:27:46,040
Air, you get it, joke, because we said we're breaking for Air, and my baby mama

1189
01:27:46,040 --> 01:27:51,800
from DDR Solo, starting that set off. Hope you enjoyed that, make some music. Here we

1190
01:27:51,800 --> 01:27:55,320
are back on the show and we may or may not get the plug pulled, we'll see pretty

1191
01:27:55,320 --> 01:27:58,440
soon here if we're gonna get the plug pulled on us for maintenance, so again if

1192
01:27:58,440 --> 01:28:02,600
we go down, we are going to be down all night, so we apologize, but we thank you

1193
01:28:02,600 --> 01:28:05,560
of course for sticking with us and listening, especially after last week

1194
01:28:05,560 --> 01:28:09,080
because last week was kind of sucky because we had the plague, all of us.

1195
01:28:09,080 --> 01:28:13,400
We had the... and it's so weird now because I don't feel, you know, sick at all, you know,

1196
01:28:13,400 --> 01:28:19,400
no remnants or anything, and I thank Airborne for helping me get over my cold or mini plague

1197
01:28:19,400 --> 01:28:20,880
or whatever it was I had very quickly.

1198
01:28:20,880 --> 01:28:22,680
I was very happy about that.

1199
01:28:22,680 --> 01:28:28,840
So I wasn't very happy about... very happy about getting over that cold quick, but, you

1200
01:28:28,840 --> 01:28:31,760
know, it sucks that we didn't have a show, but at least you got the podcast, right?

1201
01:28:31,760 --> 01:28:35,080
Which was interesting because it was our 50th podcast and we were all sick as hell.

1202
01:28:35,080 --> 01:28:37,080
I still have the plague.

1203
01:28:37,080 --> 01:28:41,080
I know you still have the plague, but the mini-plague is gone.

1204
01:28:41,080 --> 01:28:43,080
But I'm going to take that Airborne stuff more often now.

1205
01:28:43,080 --> 01:28:46,080
That's some good stuff. I'm going to take one of those every day, see what happens.

1206
01:28:46,080 --> 01:28:48,080
See if it makes me a strong boy.

1207
01:28:48,080 --> 01:28:49,080
Can't you just take a multivitamin?

1208
01:28:49,080 --> 01:28:54,080
I've thought about that too, but the thing I like about Airborne is that it actually makes a drink.

1209
01:28:54,080 --> 01:28:56,080
Kind of. And the drink's not bad.

1210
01:28:56,080 --> 01:28:58,080
I've had worse things in my life, so we'll see.

1211
01:28:58,080 --> 01:29:03,080
It's one of those acquired tastes kind of things. We'll see.

1212
01:29:03,080 --> 01:29:06,840
Anyway, I'm curious here, because we're getting into the Christmas season, first I want to

1213
01:29:06,840 --> 01:29:09,640
know what's on your Christmas list.

1214
01:29:09,640 --> 01:29:13,000
I want to know what's on our host Christmas list, what's on your Christmas list, maybe

1215
01:29:13,000 --> 01:29:18,760
gaming-wise or maybe just anything-wise, and what your plans are for this lovely Christmas

1216
01:29:18,760 --> 01:29:19,760
break coming up.

1217
01:29:19,760 --> 01:29:24,360
Or Hanukkah, so you know what I mean, when I say Christmas I mean all that, okay?

1218
01:29:24,360 --> 01:29:29,620
We are not going to be politically correct on this program, we're putting it all under

1219
01:29:29,620 --> 01:29:34,380
the label of Christmas, which is probably not extremely politically correct, but you

1220
01:29:34,380 --> 01:29:35,380
know how it goes.

1221
01:29:35,380 --> 01:29:37,060
So, Loki, I'll start with you, my friend.

1222
01:29:37,060 --> 01:29:40,220
What's on your Christmas list, and what are you going to do for the holidays?

1223
01:29:40,220 --> 01:29:44,780
I don't really have anything on my Christmas list since I've already bought my 360.

1224
01:29:44,780 --> 01:29:47,820
I just... probably an HDTV, I guess.

1225
01:29:47,820 --> 01:29:53,620
If I were to ever get one, that would be almost impossible because they're expensive.

1226
01:29:53,620 --> 01:29:55,340
But other than that, I don't know.

1227
01:29:55,340 --> 01:29:58,420
There's not really any games I want.

1228
01:29:58,420 --> 01:30:03,540
I have to wait, I guess. Dead or Alive, I guess I could try to go get that since, um...

1229
01:30:03,540 --> 01:30:05,640
that's supposed to come out this week.

1230
01:30:05,640 --> 01:30:07,540
Assuming it doesn't get pushed back again.

1231
01:30:07,540 --> 01:30:12,700
Just in time for the holiday. They're airing the commercials on TV and everything, you just think that could be out?

1232
01:30:12,700 --> 01:30:15,820
Actually, no, I take that back. It's not coming out this week. It's coming out next week.

1233
01:30:15,820 --> 01:30:17,100
The 29th.

1234
01:30:17,100 --> 01:30:20,820
Just in time for the gift certificates and the holiday returns. Yes, exactly.

1235
01:30:20,820 --> 01:30:26,900
Um, so maybe I'll get that. I'm not a huge fighting game fan, but it looked good, so...

1236
01:30:26,900 --> 01:30:27,940
I'll check it out.

1237
01:30:27,940 --> 01:30:30,420
Ummm...

1238
01:30:30,420 --> 01:30:35,540
I don't know, there's really not too much I want.

1239
01:30:35,540 --> 01:30:39,300
Just, I don't know, HDTV I guess I could need one of those. I need to finish my cabinet.

1240
01:30:39,300 --> 01:30:44,060
I need time to finish my cabinet.

1241
01:30:44,060 --> 01:30:47,620
It's been a while. I need to finish it.

1242
01:30:47,620 --> 01:30:49,500
Get the other controllers done.

1243
01:30:49,500 --> 01:30:55,420
But, I'm kind of holding back because I don't have any place to store them if I were to finish them.

1244
01:30:55,420 --> 01:30:57,820
Storage is a big issue.

1245
01:30:57,820 --> 01:31:01,420
Um, but as far as Christmas plans go, uh...

1246
01:31:01,420 --> 01:31:06,320
Playing a lot of Xbox Live, hopefully, because I did pay for a year of it, and I want to

1247
01:31:06,320 --> 01:31:08,020
kind of get some use out of it.

1248
01:31:08,020 --> 01:31:09,060
Um...

1249
01:31:09,060 --> 01:31:14,140
And also, I'm supposed to go to my sister's house for Christmas,

1250
01:31:14,140 --> 01:31:15,940
but she's local, so...

1251
01:31:15,940 --> 01:31:17,120
Um...

1252
01:31:17,120 --> 01:31:21,060
That's pretty much it, though. It's just going to be pretty low-key.

1253
01:31:21,060 --> 01:31:24,060
Low-key. Low-key.

1254
01:31:27,060 --> 01:31:31,060
For Christmas, I want world peace.

1255
01:31:31,060 --> 01:31:36,060
I want a lot of booty, too. I want some booty calls. No, just kidding.

1256
01:31:36,060 --> 01:31:44,060
Or am I? I like my Netflix a lot, so I want free Netflix, so I don't have to pay for it anymore,

1257
01:31:44,060 --> 01:31:49,060
because I'm loving that thing ever since I got that. Now I don't have to buy DVDs anymore.

1258
01:31:49,060 --> 01:31:54,220
more. But if people do want to buy me DVDs, I'm always a sucker for, you know, gift certificates

1259
01:31:54,220 --> 01:31:59,580
and stuff. Let's see, what else do I want? I kind of want an Xbox 360 and I kind of don't.

1260
01:31:59,580 --> 01:32:02,060
Like, you can wait. But if somebody wanted to give me one for Christmas, hey, I wouldn't

1261
01:32:02,060 --> 01:32:06,780
mind. I'd get that other Xbox out of there and get the other Xbox in there, the 360.

1262
01:32:06,780 --> 01:32:10,580
Because it definitely is pretty, and I do happen to have an HDTV, so it looks very,

1263
01:32:10,580 --> 01:32:14,380
very pretty. I already kind of bought myself an early Christmas present. I bought myself

1264
01:32:14,380 --> 01:32:18,140
a new phone, because my old phone, this is what I did last weekend since we kind of ended

1265
01:32:18,140 --> 01:32:23,200
up not doing a show. I have a new phone here and it actually takes a video which

1266
01:32:23,200 --> 01:32:29,560
is an incredibly useless feature until we like go to E3 or something where you

1267
01:32:29,560 --> 01:32:32,720
know video is going to be something we're very glad we have so I'm happy to

1268
01:32:32,720 --> 01:32:37,100
have a phone that does video. I'll have my camcorder. It's kind of need to be

1269
01:32:37,100 --> 01:32:40,520
able to upload video and it does it does make a pixel pictures so I'm kind of

1270
01:32:40,520 --> 01:32:43,320
impressed so that was the Christmas present I bought myself. I don't actually

1271
01:32:43,320 --> 01:32:47,080
have a lot planned for Christmas because I have a very small family it's just me

1272
01:32:47,080 --> 01:32:51,080
my mom my dad that are gonna get together this year that's it so um my

1273
01:32:51,080 --> 01:32:55,360
mom wants to see memoirs of a go show so I suppose I'll endows that let it go see

1274
01:32:55,360 --> 01:33:00,000
she actually she wants to see Brokeback Mountain too which I really want to see

1275
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:03,140
of course too but I don't think that's going to be out here on Christmas it's

1276
01:33:03,140 --> 01:33:08,460
in that limited release thing you know I think they're afraid of releasing it in

1277
01:33:08,460 --> 01:33:13,820
the red states so to speak because you know I guess people in red states quote

1278
01:33:13,820 --> 01:33:18,500
quote unquote, can't appreciate a good gay cowboy movie, but I've read the book and there's

1279
01:33:18,500 --> 01:33:21,980
more to it than the gay cowboy thing. The media is really putting the spin on it.

1280
01:33:21,980 --> 01:33:27,700
It's just like, oh my God, it's Gay Cowboys Fucking. No, it's not Gay Cowboys Fucking

1281
01:33:27,700 --> 01:33:32,180
is not what the movie's about. It's a tale of forbidden love. Romeo and Juliet was a

1282
01:33:32,180 --> 01:33:38,100
tale about forbidden love, okay? That is what the movie is really about. It's not about

1283
01:33:38,100 --> 01:33:43,780
Jake Gyllenhaal doing Heath Ledger in the Booty Hole, although that might be a plus.

1284
01:33:43,780 --> 01:33:49,660
DarkSakura, what are your Christmas wishes, and what do you have planned for this Christmas?

1285
01:33:49,660 --> 01:33:56,780
I want a memory foam contour pillow, or a Soba Kawa pillow, very, very much.

1286
01:33:56,780 --> 01:34:03,300
And I don't really want any video game systems because I already own them all.

1287
01:34:03,300 --> 01:34:07,500
I do want a copy of Emerald Dragon for PC Engine.

1288
01:34:07,500 --> 01:34:09,180
I've wanted that game for a while.

1289
01:34:09,180 --> 01:34:11,240
Um, and of course, uh,

1290
01:34:11,240 --> 01:34:15,220
panorama cotton for the master system. Good luck.

1291
01:34:15,220 --> 01:34:20,280
Someone must have tossed down six hundred dollars on me. I am not opposed to that.

1292
01:34:20,280 --> 01:34:23,900
Um, I also want a tapeworm.

1293
01:34:23,900 --> 01:34:27,580
Like one that won't kill me, but that will eat all my extra food.

1294
01:34:27,580 --> 01:34:29,560
I'd actually like my appetite back.

1295
01:34:29,560 --> 01:34:31,940
And I'd like to be over the plague.

1296
01:34:31,940 --> 01:34:33,780
And I want a hippopotamus for Christmas.

1297
01:34:33,780 --> 01:34:35,780
I want to get the pot of this.

1298
01:34:35,780 --> 01:34:37,780
Wasn't that in your little pre-show tonight?

1299
01:34:37,780 --> 01:34:38,780
Yep.

1300
01:34:38,780 --> 01:34:40,780
I want a penguin for Christmas.

1301
01:34:40,780 --> 01:34:42,780
I want a compound.

1302
01:34:42,780 --> 01:34:46,780
So that we can hole up in it and drink red Kool-Aid.

1303
01:34:46,780 --> 01:34:48,780
Sounds like fun.

1304
01:34:48,780 --> 01:34:49,780
Lots of fun.

1305
01:34:49,780 --> 01:34:52,780
And I need season 8 of Stargate.

1306
01:34:52,780 --> 01:34:53,780
Fox set.

1307
01:34:53,780 --> 01:34:54,780
Very much so.

1308
01:34:54,780 --> 01:34:58,780
And the Sony Ericsson Vodafone new one.

1309
01:34:58,780 --> 01:35:00,780
I need that too.

1310
01:35:00,780 --> 01:35:04,820
You know what movie, because you brought up a good point about like hippopotamuses and

1311
01:35:04,820 --> 01:35:08,580
the animals we went for Christmas, do you know what movie I finally saw because nobody

1312
01:35:08,580 --> 01:35:10,180
would go see it with me in the theater?

1313
01:35:10,180 --> 01:35:11,180
Madagascar?

1314
01:35:11,180 --> 01:35:12,180
No.

1315
01:35:12,180 --> 01:35:13,180
March of the Penguins.

1316
01:35:13,180 --> 01:35:14,180
Oh.

1317
01:35:14,180 --> 01:35:15,180
I finally saw on DVD.

1318
01:35:15,180 --> 01:35:16,180
I would see that.

1319
01:35:16,180 --> 01:35:19,580
You know what the big surprise was about March of the Penguins?

1320
01:35:19,580 --> 01:35:20,580
Boring.

1321
01:35:20,580 --> 01:35:21,580
Fucking boring.

1322
01:35:21,580 --> 01:35:28,760
I love penguins, love penguins, but the movie was very boring and dry and there were dead

1323
01:35:28,760 --> 01:35:32,960
baby penguins, which for a penguin fan, no, no, no, you do not show me dead baby penguins

1324
01:35:32,960 --> 01:35:39,440
because that was sad. I couldn't take that. No club seals? No club, dead frozen baby penguins.

1325
01:35:39,440 --> 01:35:44,800
Who wants to see that? Honestly. And this is a G-rated movie, boys and girls. I was

1326
01:35:44,800 --> 01:35:52,960
very sad about that. So, anything else on your Christmas wish list and Christmas plans,

1327
01:35:52,960 --> 01:35:58,960
Um, I want a coffee pot. Like a nice one. That does lattes.

1328
01:35:58,960 --> 01:36:02,960
Ooh, like a Frappuccino maker or whatever they call it.

1329
01:36:02,960 --> 01:36:04,960
Sort of like the big machines they have at Starbucks.

1330
01:36:04,960 --> 01:36:06,960
Espresso machine.

1331
01:36:06,960 --> 01:36:12,960
And I want the Foamy the Squirrel DVDs, even though Foamy's voice gives me a headache.

1332
01:36:12,960 --> 01:36:16,960
Because it's all about the guy that works at Starbucks.

1333
01:36:16,960 --> 01:36:18,960
I didn't know they actually released that on DVD now.

1334
01:36:18,960 --> 01:36:23,640
Yeah, they're probably the squirrels DVDs and actually I want the the squirrely raft t-shirt, too

1335
01:36:23,640 --> 01:36:26,260
You know, we need to release the DVD. We should do

1336
01:36:26,840 --> 01:36:33,740
Hey, maybe that'll be an upcoming event for 2006. We'll see we have our own best of DVD release

1337
01:36:33,740 --> 01:36:38,720
We'll see. We'll see we can do we've got a lot of stuff in store for 2006 here at orange launch radio

1338
01:36:38,720 --> 01:36:42,880
Yeah, I think we do including me moving to Antarctica. You know, the t-shirt thing is gonna happen

1339
01:36:42,880 --> 01:36:44,660
I got to talk to you guys about that after the show

1340
01:36:44,660 --> 01:36:50,180
But with the t-shirts are happening kids there will be shirts like very very soon like January soon

1341
01:36:50,220 --> 01:36:53,480
We're hoping if we get our logo done and everything we're gonna have shirts

1342
01:36:53,480 --> 01:37:00,400
It's very exciting because you guys been begging us for shirts for a long time, so we're gonna make that happen very soon

1343
01:37:00,860 --> 01:37:02,860
That's kind of our Christmas present to you

1344
01:37:03,860 --> 01:37:08,140
Because we live our fans in it in addition to doing this show all the time

1345
01:37:10,580 --> 01:37:12,580
All right anyway

1346
01:37:12,580 --> 01:37:16,920
Well, it looks like we got past eight o'clock and we're still going, so I'm thinking that

1347
01:37:16,920 --> 01:37:21,940
means unless Live 365 is being slow, we are safe from getting dropped tonight, so that's

1348
01:37:21,940 --> 01:37:22,940
good.

1349
01:37:22,940 --> 01:37:25,580
Let's move on into the cage match, boys and girls.

1350
01:37:25,580 --> 01:37:30,100
Let's do an orange lounge, good old-fashioned beat-down cage match type thing.

1351
01:37:30,100 --> 01:37:39,460
All right, the way the cage match works is we're going to play three songs for you guys,

1352
01:37:39,460 --> 01:37:43,300
And you guys are going to pick your favorite, and the winning song goes into rotation all

1353
01:37:43,300 --> 01:37:48,380
week long on Orange Lounge Radio's Babani music and video game music program.

1354
01:37:48,380 --> 01:37:50,380
Okay, so you guys are just going to vote for your favorite.

1355
01:37:50,380 --> 01:37:54,900
Let's see, two weeks ago, since we didn't do a show last week, we had this song win,

1356
01:37:54,900 --> 01:38:00,060
and it's actually a DDR artist who actually won the cage match.

1357
01:38:00,060 --> 01:38:02,060
The artist's name is Tess.

1358
01:38:02,060 --> 01:38:07,060
It's Tess, and the song is called The Second You Sleep, I Stay To Watch You Fade Away,

1359
01:38:07,060 --> 01:38:09,060
and we're going to go ahead and play this song for you guys.

1360
01:38:09,060 --> 01:38:14,560
But you only get a clip because it actually already won a couple weeks ago, so you only get a clip of it.

1361
01:38:14,560 --> 01:38:19,060
And it's going for a third week, second win, tonight in the Cage Match.

1362
01:38:19,060 --> 01:38:21,560
So enjoy or don't, it's your decision.

1363
01:38:21,560 --> 01:38:25,560
But it is last week's winner here. It is song number one test the second you sleep enjoy

1364
01:38:51,560 --> 01:38:54,560
I dream of you tonight

1365
01:38:54,560 --> 01:38:58,560
Tomorrow you'll be gone

1366
01:38:58,560 --> 01:39:05,560
I wish my God would stay

1367
01:39:05,560 --> 01:39:11,560
I'll stay awake

1368
01:39:11,560 --> 01:39:18,560
I'll stay awake and watch you breathe

1369
01:39:18,560 --> 01:39:22,060
I'll stay awake and watch it flow

1370
01:39:23,060 --> 01:39:26,060
Away into the night

1371
01:39:26,560 --> 01:39:33,060
Escape into a dream

1372
01:39:35,060 --> 01:39:40,060
I'll stay awake and watch it fade away

1373
01:39:40,060 --> 01:39:43,560
I dream of you tonight

1374
01:39:43,560 --> 01:39:47,060
Tomorrow you'll be gone

1375
01:39:47,060 --> 01:39:53,620
It gives me time to say, to watch you fade away

1376
01:39:53,620 --> 01:40:00,820
I dream of you for life, tomorrow you'll be gone

1377
01:40:00,820 --> 01:40:08,420
I wish by God you'd stay

1378
01:40:08,420 --> 01:40:14,820
Hey

1379
01:40:14,820 --> 01:40:24,820
I say to watch you fade away I dream of you tonight

1380
01:40:24,820 --> 01:40:31,820
Tomorrow you'll be gone Excuse me, it's time to say

1381
01:40:31,820 --> 01:40:38,820
To watch you fade away I dream of you tonight

1382
01:40:38,820 --> 01:40:42,480
tomorrow you're all regone

1383
01:40:42,480 --> 01:40:45,880
I wish my god could stay

1384
01:40:45,880 --> 01:40:49,260
to watch you fade away

1385
01:40:49,260 --> 01:40:50,440

test of the battle of two other songs. Two other songs here tonight. Song number 2 is

1405
01:41:17,800 --> 01:41:21,120
Dark Soccer's pick. Dark Soccer, what did you pick for our listeners tonight?

1406
01:41:21,120 --> 01:41:26,060
It's a song I've been meaning to put in the cage for a while because we really, really

1407
01:41:26,060 --> 01:41:32,140
need Drum and Bass represented. It's one of my favorite DJs and one of my favorite singers

1408
01:41:32,140 --> 01:41:37,940
and it's actually one of my all-time favorite songs ever. It's DJ Crush and Espero with

1409
01:41:37,940 --> 01:41:42,220
final home right I played it on my show a couple times so our listeners might

1410
01:41:42,220 --> 01:41:47,740
find it familiar all right sounds good DJ crush with a thorough final home is

1411
01:41:47,740 --> 01:41:49,740
This is song number two. Enjoy!

1412
01:42:17,740 --> 01:42:40,820
I traveled far to find you Who knew being so far away, I would stay

1413
01:42:40,820 --> 01:42:50,820
This weary heart, the only gift I bring

1414
01:42:50,820 --> 01:43:00,820
This love I give to you, this lonely strain

1415
01:43:00,820 --> 01:43:15,820
I will give you the most delicious

1416
01:43:15,820 --> 01:43:28,820
I will give you the most delicious

1417
01:43:28,820 --> 01:43:43,660
You see I need you to be, addicted to me I am calm, in the corners of your mouth

1418
01:43:43,660 --> 01:43:48,900
I am still numb Will I live without?

1419
01:43:48,900 --> 01:43:51,900
I am pure love

1420
01:43:51,900 --> 01:43:54,900
The space inside my final

1421
01:44:21,900 --> 01:44:23,900
Oh

1422
01:44:51,900 --> 01:45:06,900
I will give you the most delicious kisses on your face

1423
01:45:06,900 --> 01:45:11,900
You see I need you to be addicted to me

1424
01:45:11,900 --> 01:45:16,900
I am calling in the corners of your mouth

1425
01:45:16,900 --> 01:45:22,100
I am still alive I will not live without

1426
01:45:22,100 --> 01:45:32,900
I am pure now Safe inside my final home

1427
01:45:32,900 --> 01:45:37,900
My only time

1428
01:45:37,900 --> 01:45:42,900
My only time

1429
01:45:42,900 --> 01:45:47,900
My only time

1430
01:45:47,900 --> 01:45:51,900
My only time

1431
01:45:51,900 --> 01:45:56,900
Baby, that my final day

1432
01:45:56,900 --> 01:46:01,900
My only hope is that

1433
01:46:03,900 --> 01:46:08,900
We will be together

1434
01:46:09,900 --> 01:46:14,900
We will be together

1435
01:46:14,900 --> 01:46:37,320
The song on the tune of tonight's cage match was DJ Crush featuring Estero with Final

1436
01:46:37,320 --> 01:46:38,320
Home.

1437
01:46:38,320 --> 01:46:43,460
Let's go around and see if that was judged as being a good song or a poopy song by our

1438
01:46:43,460 --> 01:46:48,460
kostjamrh That song is sexy, it gets a 10.

1439
01:46:48,460 --> 01:46:53,460
kostjamrh It's not that sexy, it gets an 8.

1440
01:46:53,460 --> 01:46:58,460
kostjamrh A not as sexy 8 from Loki?

1441
01:46:58,460 --> 01:47:03,460
kostjamrh I don't know if I would call that drum and bass, that's trip-hop before I would call it drum and bass.

1442
01:47:03,460 --> 01:47:08,460
kostjamrh But DJ Crush has almost called drum and bass.

1443
01:47:08,460 --> 01:47:18,460
kostjamrh It's a song I could imagine myself having sex to, which is always a good thing, so I give it a 9. Very nice.

1444
01:47:18,460 --> 01:47:24,460
kostjamrh Alright, let's get into song number 3 tonight. Loki, you picked song number 3. Loki, what did you pick for us?

1445
01:47:24,460 --> 01:47:29,660
I picked something completely last minute. I have not even listened to this yet.

1446
01:47:29,660 --> 01:47:33,100
So this is a suicide pick from Loki, basically.

1447
01:47:33,100 --> 01:47:39,580
Well, originally this week I had wanted to pick, like, a remix of the Contra theme, for some reason.

1448
01:47:39,580 --> 01:47:42,940
And I don't know why. I did download something, but it was too long.

1449
01:47:42,940 --> 01:47:46,140
It was, like, seven minutes long because it was kind of a medley.

1450
01:47:46,140 --> 01:47:51,260
But this is another remix. This is actually from Contra Shattered Soldier,

1451
01:47:51,260 --> 01:47:54,980
and the remix is called Spread Your Fire Against Me.

1452
01:47:54,980 --> 01:47:58,780
At first I thought this song was called Spread Your Legs, because I just saw the Spread Your.

1453
01:47:58,780 --> 01:48:02,420
Oh yeah, Spread Your Fire Against Me. It's by Brain Cells and Dennis.

1454
01:48:02,420 --> 01:48:06,500
It's song number three, and Loki better hope it's good or else it can't look like an ass.

1455
01:48:06,500 --> 01:48:08,500
Alright, here it is. Enjoy.

1456
01:48:36,500 --> 01:48:47,500
There's no sign of prophecy, I can't grab your hand

1457
01:48:47,500 --> 01:48:52,500
No way, by the time you call your mind, you can't put it in your hand

1458
01:48:52,500 --> 01:48:58,500
The day is hit, you nail your death, the night is by the door

1459
01:48:58,500 --> 01:49:03,500
And what are you, a moving star, having had it in you before?

1460
01:49:03,500 --> 01:49:09,500
I won't let you live and have no use to me

1461
01:49:09,500 --> 01:49:16,500
And I know you're driving me so high up against me

1462
01:49:25,500 --> 01:49:29,500
I will find you out of bed

1463
01:49:29,500 --> 01:49:36,500
And after all the road is raked on fire, all can see

1464
01:49:43,500 --> 01:49:49,500
Echos in the darkness, burning in the night

1465
01:49:50,500 --> 01:49:56,500
Fire in the darkness, all reaching destruction to survive

1466
01:49:56,500 --> 01:50:09,500
I am proud to be a star, to be fine, dying for the eyes

1467
01:50:09,500 --> 01:50:16,500
Careful, you are gone now, we see the fresh eyes

1468
01:50:16,500 --> 01:50:23,500
They won't learn from their different souls to defend tonight

1469
01:50:23,500 --> 01:50:30,500
The world is a hell of a new town

1470
01:50:30,500 --> 01:50:35,500
The world is a city

1471
01:50:35,500 --> 01:50:39,500
The world is a city

1472
01:50:39,500 --> 01:50:42,500
The spirit of time

1473
01:50:42,500 --> 01:50:45,500
I was left in prison

1474
01:50:45,500 --> 01:50:49,500
Asking every prayer to their kind

1475
01:50:49,500 --> 01:50:55,500
DIE!

1476
01:50:55,500 --> 01:51:23,500
I'm a bad ass total fighter

1477
01:51:23,500 --> 01:51:26,140
Where the fuck is you and stop it?

1478
01:51:26,140 --> 01:51:29,980
I look in the mirror and I'm still moving

1479
01:51:29,980 --> 01:51:32,540
Don't leave or I'll blow

1480
01:51:32,540 --> 01:51:35,180
Before you know it, you're dead

1481
01:51:35,180 --> 01:51:39,180
Speak to me, you're one

1482
01:51:41,180 --> 01:51:45,180
I'm fucking one

1483
01:51:47,180 --> 01:51:50,140
I will lose someone, get back to me

1484
01:51:50,140 --> 01:51:52,780
There is great time to be lost yet

1485
01:51:52,780 --> 01:51:55,280
I will just be a stranger

1486
01:51:55,280 --> 01:51:57,880
Still, I'm not your inspiration

1487
01:51:57,880 --> 01:52:02,680
I'm not

1488
01:52:08,180 --> 01:52:10,180
Song number three, God I love our challenge

1489
01:52:10,180 --> 01:52:15,580
Song number three, Brain Cells and Dennis with, uh, Spread Your Fire Against Me

1490
01:52:15,580 --> 01:52:18,880
Which apparently is a remix from Conquer Shattered Soldier, who knew?

1491
01:52:18,880 --> 01:52:25,080
Uh, let's see, does that make you want to spread your fire or spread your hate? I don't know, uh, DarkSucker, what'd you think?

1492
01:52:25,080 --> 01:52:31,680
It makes me feel like I should worship Satan or something. So it gets a minus 666.

1493
01:52:31,680 --> 01:52:33,180
Loki.

1494
01:52:34,180 --> 01:52:37,780
It gets a positive 666 to counteract the minus 666.

1495
01:52:37,780 --> 01:52:39,480
So it effectively has a zero?

1496
01:52:39,480 --> 01:52:41,880
Yes! Good thinking, Loki. Good thinking.

1497
01:52:42,480 --> 01:52:46,080
Um, that song does make me want to smoke crack and worship Satan.

1498
01:52:46,080 --> 01:52:51,380
Um, but, um, you know, actually it kind of reminded me of GWAR a little bit, and I started thinking about

1499
01:52:51,380 --> 01:52:52,580
GWAR is a lot cooler!

1500
01:52:52,580 --> 01:52:56,780
I know GWAR is a lot cooler, but didn't I just, like, imagine, like, these giant outfits?

1501
01:52:56,780 --> 01:53:04,080
Because the thing I love about GWAR, I like, I- fuck the music with GWAR, but, uh, just them getting up in those giant costumes and thrashing about

1502
01:53:04,080 --> 01:53:10,380
where they all look like Shao Kahn from Mortal Kombat, and they're on stage thrashing about, is really badass.

1503
01:53:10,380 --> 01:53:13,380
And so I kind of thought about that, and that made me giggle a lot.

1504
01:53:13,380 --> 01:53:18,380
So that song gets like a five to the number of times I laugh.

1505
01:53:18,380 --> 01:53:23,380
Alright, but it's not up to us. We are not the final judges.

1506
01:53:23,380 --> 01:53:27,380
You are. You kids that listen to this program out there and are in our chat room right now, you are the final say.

1507
01:53:27,380 --> 01:53:30,380
So let's see the three songs you get to vote for tonight.

1508
01:53:30,380 --> 01:53:36,380
Song number one as a reminder is Tess with The Second You Sleep, I Stay to Watch You Fade Away.

1509
01:53:36,380 --> 01:53:43,580
Anyway.

1510
01:53:43,580 --> 01:53:50,540
And song number two you can vote for tonight is DJ Crush and Astero with a song called

1511
01:53:50,540 --> 01:53:58,420
Final Home.

1512
01:53:58,420 --> 01:54:02,820
And song number three you can vote for tonight is Brain Cells and Dennis with Spread Your

1513
01:54:02,820 --> 01:54:09,820
fire against me.

1514
01:54:32,820 --> 01:54:35,940
I've got a couple of DJ Crash CDs with different mixes of it on there.

1515
01:54:35,940 --> 01:54:39,940
It's a good time. I like it. I hope it does well, but we'll see. It's up to the chat room.

1516
01:54:39,940 --> 01:54:45,940
So send in your votes now. Well, it looks like we didn't get the plug pulled on us, so we get to continue to do a show here.

1517
01:54:45,940 --> 01:54:50,940
How's OLR Town going? Did you finally just close the gate and say fuck you all and now you and Jamie are playing?

1518
01:54:50,940 --> 01:54:55,940
No, but Harold's been the only one that's joined. So I am taking this time to write OLR

1519
01:54:55,940 --> 01:54:59,540
um, message in a bottle spam. Oh, propaganda.

1520
01:54:59,540 --> 01:55:00,540
Good, good thinking.

1521
01:55:00,540 --> 01:55:01,540
That was my idea.

1522
01:55:01,540 --> 01:55:02,540
What is this?

1523
01:55:02,540 --> 01:55:09,380
You guys are going to spam Orange Lounge Radio across Animal Crossing World by what, using

1524
01:55:09,380 --> 01:55:10,380
the bottle?

1525
01:55:10,380 --> 01:55:11,380
How does this work?

1526
01:55:11,380 --> 01:55:13,900
The message in the bottle, you basically write whatever you want, put it in the bottle and

1527
01:55:13,900 --> 01:55:14,900
drop it in the ocean.

1528
01:55:14,900 --> 01:55:17,900
Message in a bottle, message.

1529
01:55:17,900 --> 01:55:18,900
Pencilled.

1530
01:55:18,900 --> 01:55:19,900
Shush.

1531
01:55:19,900 --> 01:55:20,900
No.

1532
01:55:20,900 --> 01:55:21,900
Penfold.

1533
01:55:21,900 --> 01:55:22,900
Shush.

1534
01:55:22,900 --> 01:55:29,500
No, um, it's like supposed to go to somebody else's random village, so they'll get, you

1535
01:55:29,500 --> 01:55:31,660
should listen to Orange on radio because we said so.

1536
01:55:31,660 --> 01:55:32,660
Very cool.

1537
01:55:32,660 --> 01:55:35,660
We'll see if it works.

1538
01:55:35,660 --> 01:55:42,340
Alright, um, Loki, after the cage match is usually where I go over to you and I say,

1539
01:55:42,340 --> 01:55:44,340
hey, Loki, what's going on in the Sim scene?

1540
01:55:44,340 --> 01:55:48,960
And you usually will say nothing, but I thought I would humor this tonight and see what's

1541
01:55:48,960 --> 01:55:49,960
going on.

1542
01:55:49,960 --> 01:56:02,960
Are they encouraging people to use commercial MP3s for this?

1543
01:56:02,960 --> 01:56:11,960
No, they're encouraging people to use royalty-free MP3s or MP3s that have the permission of the artist to use.

1544
01:56:11,960 --> 01:56:14,960
So in other words, they'll be forced to come up with something original?

1545
01:56:14,960 --> 01:56:15,960
Something original.

1546
01:56:15,960 --> 01:56:16,960
I like this.

1547
01:56:16,960 --> 01:56:23,960
And then, um, so there's a contest going on there, and then I think, um, OSC4 was just finishing up.

1548
01:56:23,960 --> 01:56:25,960
And that's about it.

1549
01:56:25,960 --> 01:56:28,960
Oh, and, um,

1550
01:56:28,960 --> 01:56:33,960
Siberia Style 3 has been released, um, the StepMania theme.

1551
01:56:33,960 --> 01:56:36,960
Sexy. That's all I gotta say about that.

1552
01:56:36,960 --> 01:56:38,960
It's awesome looking.

1553
01:56:38,960 --> 01:56:45,960
Japanese, of course, because, you know, they kick ass when it comes to anything that has to do with DDR, SIMS, or whatever.

1554
01:56:45,960 --> 01:56:48,960
A lot more effort being put in there.

1555
01:56:48,960 --> 01:56:52,960
That's it. That's all that's going on in the world.

1556
01:56:52,960 --> 01:56:54,960
Well, tell me about something going on in the hack-and-crack world,

1557
01:56:54,960 --> 01:56:56,960
because we gotta fill time here while we get cage match votes, Tali.

1558
01:56:56,960 --> 01:56:59,960
Well, um, apparently...

1559
01:56:59,960 --> 01:57:00,960
Last call for cage match votes, Tali.

1560
01:57:00,960 --> 01:57:05,960
Homebrew, um, stuff, they've gotten it to run now through version 2.5 and 2.6,

1561
01:57:05,960 --> 01:57:11,960
using the same workaround that they've used to create that trainer for, um, Grand Theft Auto.

1562
01:57:11,960 --> 01:57:18,840
And so they're actually using that to port homebrew to the PSP on firmwares, you know,

1563
01:57:18,840 --> 01:57:20,840
2.5 and 2.6.

1564
01:57:20,840 --> 01:57:25,800
So what that means is probably there'll be another firmware coming out for the PSP to

1565
01:57:25,800 --> 01:57:28,360
break all that stuff.

1566
01:57:28,360 --> 01:57:32,920
And then what'll happen is they'll come out with something else to break that, and the

1567
01:57:32,920 --> 01:57:37,800
cycle keeps going on and on.

1568
01:57:37,800 --> 01:57:44,080
And other things, there's actually been some pretty cool stuff for like the 360 being put

1569
01:57:44,080 --> 01:57:46,240
on Xbox Live.

1570
01:57:46,240 --> 01:57:50,880
One of them being more downloadable cars for Ridge Racer 6, which makes me happy.

1571
01:57:50,880 --> 01:57:52,600
And those are free.

1572
01:57:52,600 --> 01:57:55,280
They've also added some music from the other games.

1573
01:57:55,280 --> 01:58:00,560
I saw some stuff, Warp Rider and stuff from, I think Ridge Racer for the PSP.

1574
01:58:00,560 --> 01:58:02,960
I'm sure that was in other ones as well.

1575
01:58:02,960 --> 01:58:05,120
But there's a lot of music in Ridge Racer.

1576
01:58:05,120 --> 01:58:12,520
There's like four virtual CDs worth of music on there, just really good stuff.

1577
01:58:12,520 --> 01:58:16,880
You know why I want an Xbox 360 is for that amazing seizure-inducing game that you showed

1578
01:58:16,880 --> 01:58:17,880
to me?

1579
01:58:17,880 --> 01:58:18,880
Geometry Wars?

1580
01:58:18,880 --> 01:58:22,160
Yeah, I want that, which is sad because you could do Geometry Wars on like a Nintendo

1581
01:58:22,160 --> 01:58:23,160
64.

1582
01:58:23,160 --> 01:58:24,160
That makes me motion sick.

1583
01:58:24,160 --> 01:58:26,960
Yeah, but I love those seizure-inducing games.

1584
01:58:26,960 --> 01:58:29,880
I mean, it's the amazing seizure geometry game.

1585
01:58:29,880 --> 01:58:30,880
I love it.

1586
01:58:30,880 --> 01:58:32,000
It's great.

1587
01:58:32,000 --> 01:58:33,000
It is pretty cool.

1588
01:58:33,000 --> 01:58:38,240
I don't know. Cameo's pretty fun. I've been playing that a little bit. Yeah? Yeah, it's

1589
01:58:38,240 --> 01:58:46,200
pretty cool. I am kind of digging it a bit. It's a little easy though, that's what I found.

1590
01:58:46,200 --> 01:58:52,100
But I'm sure it gets a lot harder throughout the game. It's still pretty. And then Ridge

1591
01:58:52,100 --> 01:58:57,560
Racer's really fun. I like that game a lot. And Call of Duty 2, the multiplayer, is really

1592
01:58:57,560 --> 01:59:06,700
fun in that. Just, I like the multiplayer a lot in that game. And, well, I don't know.

1593
01:59:06,700 --> 01:59:12,020
Just, overall pretty fun. I'm thinking about maybe picking up another game here. Not sure

1594
01:59:12,020 --> 01:59:19,440
what I want to pick up though. Maybe Need for Speed. Definitely going to get Dead or

1595
01:59:19,440 --> 01:59:25,400
live for when that comes out. Been actually pretty excited, um, they've been showing some

1596
01:59:25,400 --> 01:59:32,120
pictures for, um, full auto, and the demo's supposed to be up pretty soon for that, and

1597
01:59:32,120 --> 01:59:37,680
that one, oh, I can't wait for that one. Gettin' the blow up everything in the entire game.

1598
01:59:37,680 --> 01:59:44,480
Blow up everything, uh. But they have, seriously, they should just release a game for the PSP

1599
01:59:44,480 --> 01:59:50,040
called BLOW UP EVERYTHING or any system really, Xbox 360, I don't care. BLOW UP EVERYTHING.

1600
01:59:50,040 --> 01:59:52,080
I would totally buy it. And that's what the commercial should be for.

1601
01:59:52,080 --> 01:59:59,320
They sort of had a commercial like that for mercenaries. Mercenaries, when it came out

1602
01:59:59,320 --> 02:00:03,340
on the PlayStation 2 and Xbox, you know, that was the commercial. Blow up buildings. Blow

1603
02:00:03,340 --> 02:00:09,900
them up again. You know, blow up tanks. Fire rockets. You know, it was just the whole commercial

1604
02:00:09,900 --> 02:00:11,440
dedicated to that, and it was great.

1605
02:00:11,440 --> 02:00:13,440
It's a great idea.

1606
02:00:25,440 --> 02:00:27,440
It's like carpet you can munch outside.

1607
02:00:27,440 --> 02:00:31,440
Well, they have, like, they're talking about the PSP and being able to play it outside.

1608
02:00:31,440 --> 02:00:36,440
Have you ever tried to play PSP outside? You can't see shit on the screen outside.

1609
02:00:36,440 --> 02:00:39,440
Well, to be fair, it goes for most systems. You can't really see the DS outside.

1610
02:00:39,440 --> 02:00:42,440
Exactly, but why are they trying to push it that you can play it outside?

1611
02:00:42,440 --> 02:00:44,440
Which is why I never fucking understood.

1612
02:00:44,440 --> 02:00:45,440
Holy at night.

1613
02:00:45,440 --> 02:00:50,440
What was that fucking game on Game Boy Advance that was the sun? It was Konami and you had to do the sun.

1614
02:00:50,440 --> 02:00:52,440
Yeah, I know what you're talking about.

1615
02:00:52,440 --> 02:00:56,440
Fuck that game. I mean, seriously, fuck it in its ear.

1616
02:00:56,440 --> 02:00:59,440
That was so stupid, that sun thing encouraging me to go outside.

1617
02:00:59,440 --> 02:01:02,440
I can't see my game when I go outside.

1618
02:01:02,440 --> 02:01:08,440
Well, actually that's the way he had to play it for those old systems that didn't have backlights, though.

1619
02:01:08,440 --> 02:01:12,440
The ones that do, though, you can't see them now.

1620
02:01:12,440 --> 02:01:18,440
Well, we're going to go to the break, kids, and when we come back I'm going to talk to you about who won the cage match.

1621
02:01:18,440 --> 02:01:21,280
And also, when we come back, we'll probably get into the FUs of the week.

1622
02:01:21,280 --> 02:01:24,000
Don't send them in just yet, but I know we have a little bit of angst.

1623
02:01:24,000 --> 02:01:26,040
We need to get out of our system, so we're going to do that.

1624
02:01:26,040 --> 02:01:29,600
And more random crap here on Orange Honors Radio when we come back.

1625
02:01:29,600 --> 02:01:33,280
In this break, the chat room requested some more happy.

1626
02:01:33,280 --> 02:01:37,040
So we have nothing but nauseously happy songs this break.

1627
02:01:37,040 --> 02:01:39,320
And for some reason, I don't have Jenny Ramen here, though.

1628
02:01:39,320 --> 02:01:40,080
I may have to fix that.

1629
02:01:40,080 --> 02:01:41,080
We'll see.

1630
02:01:41,080 --> 02:01:43,240
But I thought of something better than Jenny Ramen.

1631
02:01:43,240 --> 02:01:46,600
And we're going to start it off with that really annoyingly happy song

1632
02:01:46,600 --> 02:01:47,400
from In the Groove.

1633
02:01:47,400 --> 02:01:51,400
So we're going to start with that, and we'll be back with more Orange on Trio after this.

1634
02:02:17,400 --> 02:02:41,160
I am dripping with it, I love it I am dripping with it, oh I love it

1635
02:02:41,160 --> 02:02:44,160
I just need hot water and soap

1636
02:02:44,160 --> 02:02:47,160
Blushing on my body

1637
02:02:48,160 --> 02:02:51,160
Blow me a bubble and I'll give you a smack

1638
02:02:51,160 --> 02:02:54,160
Somewhere on your body

1639
02:02:55,160 --> 02:02:58,160
Oh cookie okey, oh yeah yeah

1640
02:02:58,160 --> 02:03:01,160
I'm a bubble dancer

1641
02:03:02,160 --> 02:03:05,160
Oh cookie okey, oh yeah yeah

1642
02:03:05,160 --> 02:03:08,160
Bubble Waffle Dancer

1643
02:03:16,160 --> 02:03:19,160
Oh, yeah, yeah

1644
02:03:19,160 --> 02:03:22,160
Bubble Waffle Dancer

1645
02:03:52,160 --> 02:03:54,160
I

1646
02:05:22,160 --> 02:05:37,160
Music

1647
02:06:52,160 --> 02:06:54,160
Now it's time to go!

1648
02:06:54,160 --> 02:06:56,160
Now it's time to go!

1649
02:06:56,160 --> 02:06:58,160
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

1650
02:08:28,160 --> 02:08:30,160
Oh

1651
02:08:58,160 --> 02:09:14,280
Mr. Random Person on the Street, who, by the way, is not an actor, what do you think of

1652
02:09:14,280 --> 02:09:16,540
the orange lounge big money music in Moore's show?

1653
02:09:16,540 --> 02:09:23,840
The music is like being transported to just this dancing spaceship place.

1654
02:09:23,840 --> 02:09:24,840
It's unearthly.

1655
02:09:24,840 --> 02:09:29,840
Unearthly. It's like being in a club, except you don't have to ask someone to dance.

1656
02:09:29,840 --> 02:09:33,840
Hi, we're back here on Orange Launch Radio, and on that break you heard happy, happy, happy music.

1657
02:09:33,840 --> 02:09:39,840
Shusha, Cheer Train, and Bubble Dancer are on the break.

1658
02:09:39,840 --> 02:09:43,840
My name is Shusha. Remember Shusha? Anyway.

1659
02:09:43,840 --> 02:09:45,840
She gives everybody her kiss.

1660
02:09:45,840 --> 02:09:49,840
Yes, that's right. You know what I actually watched on TV?

1661
02:09:49,840 --> 02:09:53,840
I watched a little bit of Sabado Higante the other night.

1662
02:09:53,840 --> 02:10:00,040
If you watch this, it's on Univision, the local Univision station, which is the Spanish

1663
02:10:00,040 --> 02:10:01,040
language network.

1664
02:10:01,040 --> 02:10:02,040
Oh, I don't watch TV.

1665
02:10:02,040 --> 02:10:05,520
You have to make an exception for Spanish TV though, because there's some great shit

1666
02:10:05,520 --> 02:10:06,520
on Spanish TV.

1667
02:10:06,520 --> 02:10:07,520
Uche libre on Telemundo!

1668
02:10:07,520 --> 02:10:08,520
Telemundo, Telemundo, Telemundo!

1669
02:10:08,520 --> 02:10:13,120
I love that stuff, and they have the best talk shows.

1670
02:10:13,120 --> 02:10:16,560
Sure, I can't understand half the shit they're saying, but I can pick up enough words, I

1671
02:10:16,560 --> 02:10:20,040
kind of know what's going on, so it's just...

1672
02:10:20,040 --> 02:10:22,280
I do love Mexican wrestling.

1673
02:10:22,280 --> 02:10:40,360
Anyway, we decided that since we did do a happy, happy bouncy break, that we will actually

1674
02:10:40,360 --> 02:10:43,760
do a very dark, depressing break next, so that would be fun.

1675
02:10:43,760 --> 02:10:47,120
We're going to do our emo break next, so that would be fun.

1676
02:10:47,120 --> 02:10:50,760
We can kind of offset that a little bit there.

1677
02:10:50,760 --> 02:10:58,560
Anyway, and now they're having a discussion here in the chat room, talking about Sirius

1678
02:10:58,560 --> 02:11:05,720
versus XM, which are the dueling satellite radios here.

1679
02:11:05,720 --> 02:11:08,960
Now have you guys ever looked into getting satellite radio?

1680
02:11:08,960 --> 02:11:13,400
My new stereo is XM compatible, but I haven't.

1681
02:11:13,400 --> 02:11:16,200
You know, that's funny because mine is Sirius compatible, and I'm in the same boat where

1682
02:11:16,200 --> 02:11:17,720
I haven't really decided to get that.

1683
02:11:17,720 --> 02:11:20,100
I'm tempted though with the Stern thing.

1684
02:11:20,100 --> 02:11:25,840
Not that I'm a huge Howard Stern fan, but I think he's interesting, and I'd be interested

1685
02:11:25,840 --> 02:11:29,220
to hear what he has to say on the new show, but I'm sure they'll be all over the Internet

1686
02:11:29,220 --> 02:11:30,220
and stuff.

1687
02:11:30,220 --> 02:11:35,240
So, I've been tempted to get serious, but Dark Sakura says that we should get on satellite

1688
02:11:35,240 --> 02:11:39,140
radio, and I tend to agree, we should be on satellite radio, but you know, Adam Curry

1689
02:11:39,140 --> 02:11:45,340
has a show on, I think it's Sirius, and he does a show about podcasting, and I think

1690
02:11:45,340 --> 02:11:50,660
he plays clips from different podcasts and I've actually submitted our show months ago

1691
02:11:50,660 --> 02:11:54,960
I submitted that little promo we did to the show and never heard back so you know the

1692
02:11:54,960 --> 02:11:58,600
best way that you could hear us on one of these stations would be to email the fuck

1693
02:11:58,600 --> 02:12:02,000
out of these people and say hey have you heard of Orange Lawn's Radio you should include

1694
02:12:02,000 --> 02:12:08,380
them syndicate syndicate and it's tough too because when we first started our podcast

1695
02:12:08,380 --> 02:12:13,580
there was very few other gaming podcasts out there only a few people jumped on the bandwagon

1696
02:12:13,580 --> 02:12:15,900
And very, very few of them are still around.

1697
02:12:15,900 --> 02:12:20,700
I can only think of like, I think maybe two other podcasts I can think of that have been

1698
02:12:20,700 --> 02:12:24,780
around just as long, if not longer, than we are that are still going regularly.

1699
02:12:24,780 --> 02:12:26,680
A lot of them kind of tapered off.

1700
02:12:26,680 --> 02:12:31,500
But now there are literally like at least a hundred video game podcasts out there on

1701
02:12:31,500 --> 02:12:32,500
the internet right now.

1702
02:12:32,500 --> 02:12:34,660
So it's tough for us to stand out from the rest.

1703
02:12:34,660 --> 02:12:37,140
You know, it's getting pretty competitive out there.

1704
02:12:37,140 --> 02:12:38,140
But we shine.

1705
02:12:38,140 --> 02:12:39,140
Yeah, we try.

1706
02:12:39,140 --> 02:12:40,140
We try our best.

1707
02:12:40,140 --> 02:12:44,540
Our three shining personalities, hopefully, put us a little bit ahead of the others, but

1708
02:12:44,540 --> 02:12:45,540
it's tough.

1709
02:12:45,540 --> 02:12:48,980
So we really do rely on the word of mouth, and you know the voting on Podcast Alley and

1710
02:12:48,980 --> 02:12:50,660
Yahoo and all that other crap.

1711
02:12:50,660 --> 02:12:53,040
You know iTunes does voting now, too.

1712
02:12:53,040 --> 02:12:57,140
So those of you kids that use iTunes, go say some nice things about us on our iTunes listing.

1713
02:12:57,140 --> 02:13:00,180
And the link is right there on OrangeLunchRadio.com.

1714
02:13:00,180 --> 02:13:01,180
And that shit helps.

1715
02:13:01,180 --> 02:13:07,260
It really does, because it gets our little things bumped up a little bit, and then people

1716
02:13:07,260 --> 02:13:09,720
notice us, and it will help.

1717
02:13:09,720 --> 02:13:15,740
Not that we're all about being number one, because we're not.

1718
02:13:15,740 --> 02:13:18,580
We're not going to be number one, because we don't have the corporate backing and those

1719
02:13:18,580 --> 02:13:21,320
folks that have the corporate backing are always going to be number one.

1720
02:13:21,320 --> 02:13:22,660
We got the people's choice.

1721
02:13:22,660 --> 02:13:27,100
We did, we won that little thing, and that was nice, and that was strictly because of

1722
02:13:27,100 --> 02:13:28,100
our fans.

1723
02:13:28,100 --> 02:13:31,980
But we just want to have fun with this.

1724
02:13:31,980 --> 02:13:35,580
And we want to bring more people, because we're a very interactive show.

1725
02:13:35,580 --> 02:13:38,940
We like to think that's one thing that maybe sets ourselves also apart from the others,

1726
02:13:38,940 --> 02:13:43,100
is that we're a very interactive show. So, anyway, something to think about.

1727
02:13:44,220 --> 02:13:46,940
Shall we hear who won tonight's cage match, boys and girls?

1728
02:13:46,940 --> 02:13:47,900
Yes, let's!

1729
02:13:47,900 --> 02:13:51,820
All right, the winner of tonight's cage match was...

1730
02:13:55,100 --> 02:13:56,380
Tess, once again!

1731
02:13:59,180 --> 02:14:02,540
Because everybody loves some generic trance in their life.

1732
02:14:03,180 --> 02:14:06,620
Enjoy that, Tess. Actually, I like that song an awful lot. Can't say a lot negative.

1733
02:14:06,620 --> 02:14:09,820
although i was very disappointed at the voting turnout very few votes is the

1734
02:14:09,820 --> 02:14:13,080
lowest voting turnout i've seen

1735
02:14:13,080 --> 02:14:14,060
election day

1736
02:14:14,060 --> 02:14:15,020
okay so

1737
02:14:15,020 --> 02:14:19,020
more voting people's in change and get to get the word out there

1738
02:14:19,020 --> 02:14:20,320
uh...

1739
02:14:20,320 --> 02:14:21,620
uh...

1740
02:14:21,620 --> 02:14:22,380
c

1741
02:14:22,380 --> 02:14:25,080
but that that that uh... i'm trying to go to our chat room there that would be

1742
02:14:25,080 --> 02:14:29,000
that was on the dot com the fact about uh...

1743
02:14:29,000 --> 02:14:30,500
in the chair of the

1744
02:14:30,500 --> 02:14:32,720
they're talking

1745
02:14:32,720 --> 02:14:34,760
they're talking about uh...

1746
02:14:34,760 --> 02:14:37,400
Why are they talking about Don and Drew?

1747
02:14:37,400 --> 02:14:38,400
That podcast.

1748
02:14:38,400 --> 02:14:39,400
That's a very...

1749
02:14:39,400 --> 02:14:42,040
Or maybe they're trying to talk about podcasts that have been around.

1750
02:14:42,040 --> 02:14:44,360
I'm talking about strictly video game podcasts.

1751
02:14:44,360 --> 02:14:47,600
I know Don and Drew have been around since podcasting started.

1752
02:14:47,600 --> 02:14:52,200
That they were the first big name couple that got on the iPod thing and started talking

1753
02:14:52,200 --> 02:14:53,720
about their sex life or whatever it is they do.

1754
02:14:53,720 --> 02:14:55,160
I've only listened to a little bit of the show.

1755
02:14:55,160 --> 02:14:56,160
I'm going to be honest, kids.

1756
02:14:56,160 --> 02:14:58,620
I don't listen to a lot of podcasts.

1757
02:14:58,620 --> 02:15:00,480
I totally support podcasting.

1758
02:15:00,480 --> 02:15:05,260
I think podcasting is truly the wave of the future, and I support it, but as somebody

1759
02:15:05,260 --> 02:15:10,140
who's trying to put together an original podcast, I don't really listen to a lot of others.

1760
02:15:10,140 --> 02:15:13,020
Which is a little bit of a controversial standpoint, because you think I could stand to learn things

1761
02:15:13,020 --> 02:15:17,540
by listening to the podcast, but at the same time, I want to make sure our show is purely

1762
02:15:17,540 --> 02:15:18,540
original.

1763
02:15:18,540 --> 02:15:21,460
Well, Yanni doesn't listen to anybody else, so that all of his music is original.

1764
02:15:21,460 --> 02:15:22,460
But Yanni sucks.

1765
02:15:22,460 --> 02:15:23,460
Not really.

1766
02:15:23,460 --> 02:15:26,460
I like some of Yanni's music.

1767
02:15:26,460 --> 02:15:33,140
You know, I know. If you're into, you know, um, screaming, um, opera pigs, then, no, I'm

1768
02:15:33,140 --> 02:15:38,780
kidding. Yanni's good if you like that kind of music, but, um, I don't, so what are you

1769
02:15:38,780 --> 02:15:43,780
saying? We're the Yanni of podcasting? Only cooler.

1770
02:15:43,780 --> 02:15:50,420
Alright, uh, anyway, I'm feeling a little angsty, so I think it's time to get into the

1771
02:15:50,420 --> 02:15:56,980
FUs of the Week. What do you kids think? You want to do some angst? Anxed up, yo.

1772
02:15:56,980 --> 02:16:01,100
Alright, let's do some angst here. Dark Soccer, of course, you know I'm always

1773
02:16:01,100 --> 02:16:04,180
going to go over and start with you. Oh, by the way guys, you can submit your FUs of

1774
02:16:04,180 --> 02:16:08,740
the Week right now. Go to www.orangelandtrader.com and click on

1775
02:16:08,740 --> 02:16:12,860
chat and send a private message to Sky with your FU of the Week, if you have an

1776
02:16:12,860 --> 02:16:15,820
FU of the Week. But you know we got to get ours out first, because we are some

1777
02:16:15,820 --> 02:16:20,020
angsty motherfuckers. So, Dark Soccer, why is it we do the FUs of the Week every

1778
02:16:20,020 --> 02:16:27,020
every single week. Grr. Argh.

1779
02:16:27,020 --> 02:16:34,020
F you to the abundant amounts of rain, um, because, uh, you know, it just makes it really

1780
02:16:44,340 --> 02:16:49,180
hard to drive when everybody else on the road is being a big dipshit. Which is the case,

1781
02:16:49,180 --> 02:16:52,020
I've passed something like three accidents on the way here today.

1782
02:16:52,020 --> 02:17:01,180
Another F.U. goes, of course, to the plague for not releasing me from its evil grip lately.

1783
02:17:01,180 --> 02:17:05,540
Another one goes toward my utter lack of appetite for being sick because I've dropped fifteen

1784
02:17:05,540 --> 02:17:09,340
pounds in the month and a half, so like none of my clothes fit me anymore, and I can't

1785
02:17:09,340 --> 02:17:11,340
really afford to go buy new ones right now.

1786
02:17:11,340 --> 02:17:16,540
Um, F.U. to the rock that flew off of the road and landed in my windshield and then

1787
02:17:16,540 --> 02:17:20,780
cracked two days later so that now I have a big split across the lower half

1788
02:17:20,780 --> 02:17:25,260
of my windshield from one end to the other and have to pay to have my

1789
02:17:25,260 --> 02:17:35,020
windshield replaced. So uh that really uh sort of hacks me off and uh a nephew goes to the

1790
02:17:35,020 --> 02:17:41,020
general stupidity on the internet but that's what he expected. Okay I'm done. Oh yeah one

1791
02:17:41,020 --> 02:17:57,940
I'd like to second the stupid driver FU. I keep seeing torrential rain coming down and

1792
02:17:57,940 --> 02:18:03,020
people driving with their headlights off still or in the fog and they're driving extremely

1793
02:18:03,020 --> 02:18:07,380
fast in the fog without their headlights on and then they wonder why they get in the car

1794
02:18:07,380 --> 02:18:17,740
accents, the stupid people out there. Also, I want to say if fuck you to the whole launch

1795
02:18:17,740 --> 02:18:22,460
lineup for the 360, because there's not that much that's out there that I want to get,

1796
02:18:22,460 --> 02:18:31,020
and I'm kind of dying to get another game. And then, finally, fuck Best Buy for just

1797
02:18:31,020 --> 02:18:33,380
overall sucking and

1798
02:18:33,380 --> 02:18:36,320
you know unfortunately i do have a hundred dollars

1799
02:18:36,320 --> 02:18:41,760
gift card to best buys and i actually go there but

1800
02:18:41,760 --> 02:18:43,800
i just don't like them

1801
02:18:43,800 --> 02:18:46,900
they're starting to get very corporate i really don't like that where they're

1802
02:18:46,900 --> 02:18:50,160
starting to push you know their stupid premium uh...

1803
02:18:50,160 --> 02:18:54,460
like their replacement plans and all that crap and the whole you know geek squad

1804
02:18:54,460 --> 02:18:56,180
it's just a very bad vibe

1805
02:18:56,180 --> 02:18:59,240
best buy used to be cool i don't know what happened

1806
02:18:59,240 --> 02:19:00,580
that's it

1807
02:19:00,580 --> 02:19:07,580
the man happened seriously

1808
02:19:09,580 --> 02:19:13,380
uh... i would say in my F.U. I'm going to third the F.U. because it seems like to

1809
02:19:13,380 --> 02:19:17,180
driving because when it seems like it starts raining in the state

1810
02:19:17,180 --> 02:19:19,180
uh... people forget how to drive

1811
02:19:19,180 --> 02:19:23,540
uh... so F.U. to that. F.U. to the fact that i've got like a million and one

1812
02:19:23,540 --> 02:19:27,940
things i need to do this next week and not enough time to do it

1813
02:19:27,940 --> 02:19:32,860
F you to just angst in general and not feeling happy with certain things and where you're at and just

1814
02:19:32,860 --> 02:19:35,580
God, haven't all this bullshit happened to me around Christmas?

1815
02:19:35,580 --> 02:19:40,940
What is it about the fucking holidays? What is it about winter time that just makes the shit hit the fan? I hate it.

1816
02:19:40,940 --> 02:19:44,180
So 2005 can go on and get the fuck out of here because we need a new year.

1817
02:19:44,180 --> 02:19:51,900
I need a clean slate and I need time to get all my errands done so I don't have to work all freaking day. It's getting old.

1818
02:19:51,900 --> 02:19:55,260
Alright. Anyway. That's that.

1819
02:19:55,260 --> 02:19:59,260
Let's go to the chat room, shall we? Let's see what our chat room angst is tonight.

1820
02:20:01,260 --> 02:20:06,260
Ron Chen would like to say F you to my job for keeping me late tonight for work and an F you to me

1821
02:20:06,260 --> 02:20:13,260

1822
02:20:13,260 --> 02:20:19,260
NintendoManiac64 says F you to more Mario Kart DS disconnectors.

1823
02:20:19,260 --> 02:20:23,260
F you to a deer hitting our van and taking out half of its grilling, killing the left light.

1825
02:20:27,220 --> 02:20:34,900

1834
02:21:48,180 --> 02:21:55,780
an F.U. to my dependence on sleep. And some F.U. is coming from Sharks Girl. F.U. to miles

1835
02:21:55,780 --> 02:22:00,820
12 to 22 of the marathon because hot damn, not only was it hard, but they friggin' ran

1836
02:22:00,820 --> 02:22:08,820
out of ice in Hawaii. 80 degrees and 10 miles is bad with no ice, but dammit, I did it.

1837
02:22:08,820 --> 02:22:15,140
And that was our last F.U. tonight. And congratulations to Sharks Girl, by the way, for running that

1838
02:22:15,140 --> 02:22:21,200
a marathon there. That's some good stuff. That's a long way to, I mean, God, I've done

1839
02:22:21,200 --> 02:22:26,000
the six mile marathon and I thought that was bad, but 22, that's, oh, shit, that's a lot.

1840
02:22:26,000 --> 02:22:31,400
All right, NintendoMateX64 also wants to add FU to Rainbow, I'm thinking Rainbow Road,

1841
02:22:31,400 --> 02:22:36,520
in Mario Kart DS. Seriously, the first ten seconds to side the entire race. That's it,

1842
02:22:36,520 --> 02:22:42,440
no more FUs. None. You're done. You're cut off. All of you. I want nothing but happiness

1843
02:22:42,440 --> 02:22:47,040
from here on out. Except for the break. Yeah, except for the break, which will be emo. Which

1844
02:22:47,040 --> 02:22:54,440
I'm very excited about. So we're getting down to the wire here. It's almost the end of the

1845
02:22:54,440 --> 02:22:58,040
year. You know, the next time we do a live show is going to be 2006, I think, because

1846
02:22:58,040 --> 02:23:01,320
we're not going to be here next week live. I think we're going to have a tape thingamabobber

1847
02:23:01,320 --> 02:23:06,320
going on. What is, Dark Soccer's F'd Up Christmas, or what are we going to do next week? I don't

1848
02:23:06,320 --> 02:23:08,800
remember. We're going to pre-tape some fucking stuff.

1849
02:23:08,800 --> 02:23:12,440
Yeah, we need to do, uh...

1850
02:23:12,440 --> 02:23:15,960
I think we should do the most fucked up Christmas songs we can find

1851
02:23:15,960 --> 02:23:18,480
and, like, Christmas Speed.

1852
02:23:18,480 --> 02:23:23,280
Oh, fuck Christmas Speed, seriously, I fucking hate that CD. Good, we should play it.

1853
02:23:23,280 --> 02:23:26,360
Alright, so we'll do the Orange Laundry O Merry Fucking Christmas

1854
02:23:26,360 --> 02:23:30,240
special. Yeah. Ugh, I don't have that to look forward to.

1855
02:23:30,240 --> 02:23:34,320
Uh, and then now what? New Year's? We're gonna be here on New Year's Day, right? We'll be back on New Year's Day.

1856
02:23:34,320 --> 02:23:38,200
Because nobody does anything on, like, New Year's Day. Unless, um,

1857
02:23:38,200 --> 02:23:41,680
like still drunk. Let's see, here's the thing is that

1858
02:23:41,680 --> 02:23:46,400
New Year's Day, guess what? Loki has that Monday off work.

1859
02:23:46,400 --> 02:23:51,680
I have that Monday off work. You know what this means. We're going to kick off 2006

1860
02:23:51,680 --> 02:23:55,800
and what could, would that be 169 or that would be 168?

1861
02:23:55,800 --> 02:23:59,440
Well you know what we could do? Well I don't know that I should be making this

1862
02:23:59,440 --> 02:24:03,120
suggestion on the air. Try me. Who cares? Who cares?

1863
02:24:03,120 --> 02:24:06,720
Well I'm sure you both are invited to Julie's thing at her condo.

1864
02:24:06,720 --> 02:24:12,720
But I was thinking I could bring my laptop, I might be able to record a little something something when the new year comes up.

1865
02:24:12,720 --> 02:24:14,720
Because I'm making apple pie.

1866
02:24:14,720 --> 02:24:18,720
Now I want to try some of that apple pie, that sounds good.

1867
02:24:18,720 --> 02:24:22,720
You know I heard if you drink a whole thing of cough syrup that you'll hallucinate.

1868
02:24:22,720 --> 02:24:24,720
We should try that live on here.

1869
02:24:24,720 --> 02:24:26,720
Except I don't like cough syrup.

1870
02:24:26,720 --> 02:24:27,720
You go first.

1871
02:24:27,720 --> 02:24:30,720
My cough syrup will make you hallucinate, it's got Vicodin in it.

1872
02:24:30,720 --> 02:24:32,720
Kids, don't follow our example please.

1873
02:24:32,720 --> 02:24:37,560
We'll do something fun for the New Year's Day show.

1874
02:24:37,560 --> 02:24:38,560
That'll be fun.

1875
02:24:38,560 --> 02:24:39,560
More drinking.

1876
02:24:39,560 --> 02:24:44,800
You know, DDR Freak is not doing their top DDR songs of the year or whatever, so maybe

1877
02:24:44,800 --> 02:24:45,840
we'll have to pick up the slack.

1878
02:24:45,840 --> 02:24:50,680
I need to talk to Iggy and see if we can steal that from DDR Freak, since they're apparently

1879
02:24:50,680 --> 02:24:53,480
not doing one this year, because they would have done it by now, right?

1880
02:24:53,480 --> 02:24:56,920
Because that poll ran, like, what, all of December?

1881
02:24:56,920 --> 02:24:58,480
I'm going to have to talk.

1882
02:24:58,480 --> 02:25:00,360
She's still doing the radio station.

1883
02:25:00,360 --> 02:25:01,360
That's public news now.

1884
02:25:01,360 --> 02:25:02,360
They posted that.

1885
02:25:02,360 --> 02:25:09,140
forms, but she's still doing her radio, right? We'll talk to Iggy. We'll invite Iggy to get

1886
02:25:09,140 --> 02:25:14,180
drunk with us, why not? That would be fun, I'll get drunk. Be good times.

1887
02:25:14,180 --> 02:25:21,180
Uhm... let's see... episode 200 of orange launch radio shows up next year... op, that's

1888
02:25:22,100 --> 02:25:26,700
gonna be crazy. Man, we've been doing this for a while.

1889
02:25:26,700 --> 02:25:30,480
What's interesting is, you know what else this kind of marks 3 years, actually it'll

1890
02:25:30,480 --> 02:25:33,600
be one more week but in this next week what Christmas Eve is this next week

1891
02:25:33,600 --> 02:25:39,960
right this marks three years three years since DDR extreme came out in arcades

1892
02:25:39,960 --> 02:25:44,720
that mix is officially three years old now and they say three years since DDR

1893
02:25:44,720 --> 02:25:50,120
essentially died in the arcades so sad I mean they've had a good life at home but

1894
02:25:50,120 --> 02:25:53,220
in the groove is out and whether you love it or hate it it's trying to pick

1895
02:25:53,220 --> 02:25:56,880
up the slack that you know DDR kind of left behind in the arcades and then the

1896
02:25:56,880 --> 02:26:02,920
home mix is a whole nother story we'll see I mean that maybe this will be the

1897
02:26:02,920 --> 02:26:07,400
year but of course we said that last year yeah and what happened no nah nada

1898
02:26:07,400 --> 02:26:10,720
although they did awesome did they have some good home mixes this year I mean

1899
02:26:10,720 --> 02:26:14,040
they've been giving us the love with the home mix extreme 2 was good

1900
02:26:14,040 --> 02:26:17,320
ultramix 3 was a little could have been better some of us were more arcade

1901
02:26:17,320 --> 02:26:24,140
players than we were the problem with what's going on is that you know and

1902
02:26:24,140 --> 02:26:28,940
To end the group's credit, whether you love it or hate it, what it's trying to do is it's

1903
02:26:28,940 --> 02:26:33,320
trying to keep that arcade scene going, and that is how, let's face it, that is how we

1904
02:26:33,320 --> 02:26:35,620
all met, the three of us here that do the show.

1905
02:26:35,620 --> 02:26:39,900
We met around a DDR machine, because it used to be the kind of thing that would attract

1906
02:26:39,900 --> 02:26:43,820
people to come together and play and have a good time together, and we'd all meet at

1907
02:26:43,820 --> 02:26:47,820
the arcade at a certain night, we'd have a, what do we call it, Bomani Night or DDR Night,

1908
02:26:47,820 --> 02:26:48,820
I don't remember what we called it.

1909
02:26:48,820 --> 02:26:54,120
to do Wednesday's over Roseville Golf Land, and you know doing the arcade thing

1910
02:26:54,120 --> 02:26:59,340
and that's kind of how we all met but now that's kind of gone. Although some

1911
02:26:59,340 --> 02:27:03,020
arcades have enough of an in the groove community where that is kind of picked

1912
02:27:03,020 --> 02:27:07,500
up to slack and I don't know I never really got into in the groove but maybe

1913
02:27:07,500 --> 02:27:10,080
that's because maybe that's not necessarily in the grooves fault. This is

1914
02:27:10,080 --> 02:27:12,340
something I was thinking about maybe it's not necessarily in the grooves

1915
02:27:12,340 --> 02:27:16,500
fault, that I'm not into it, maybe it's the arcades in this town's fault because

1916
02:27:16,500 --> 02:27:20,080
honestly the only arcade that has in the groove in this town kind of sucks for

1917
02:27:20,080 --> 02:27:24,740
gatherings because I'm afraid I'm gonna get shot every time I go there so you

1918
02:27:24,740 --> 02:27:28,080
know I think that's part of the bigger problem why we don't have that community

1919
02:27:28,080 --> 02:27:31,880
at least in this town but I hear it's good doing well in other towns so who

1920
02:27:31,880 --> 02:27:36,920
knows this is a good point for us to do the emo break now that I'm getting all

1921
02:27:36,920 --> 02:27:40,760
emotional only go with the emo break remember kids down the road not across

1922
02:27:40,760 --> 02:27:46,280
the street that's right all right so we're gonna do some emo and we'll be

1923
02:27:46,280 --> 02:27:50,440
back with more Orange Lounge radio and what will you do you want to do some

1924
02:27:50,440 --> 02:27:59,520
Ask Orange Lounge when we come back? Why not? I want to do some best ofs, although we have to save some of that for the podcast too, we'll do some best ofs as

1925
02:27:59,520 --> 02:28:06,800
well in this break let's start it off with I think this song is pretty fucking

1926
02:28:06,800 --> 02:28:09,320
depressing so we're gonna start off with a little bit of silhouette of my mind

1927
02:28:09,320 --> 02:28:13,160
this is definitely an emo song so we'll be back with more as this is we did a

1928
02:28:13,160 --> 02:28:15,380
happy break we're gonna do the depressing as fuck break and then we'll

1929
02:28:15,380 --> 02:28:18,380
So enjoy this, and we'll be back with more Orange Launch Radio.

1930
02:28:45,380 --> 02:28:50,380
I need you, I need you

1931
02:29:15,380 --> 02:29:39,260
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight...

1932
02:30:09,260 --> 02:30:11,260
Thanks for watching!

1933
02:30:39,260 --> 02:30:51,260
I'm just so crazy, I'm considered a tree The thoughts they start to come to me

1934
02:30:51,260 --> 02:30:55,260
All my pain, all my shame They actually make my way

1935
02:30:55,260 --> 02:31:02,260
Just to go straight to the center of my heart

1936
02:31:02,260 --> 02:31:08,260
I am frozen from the sound

1937
02:31:11,260 --> 02:31:15,260
I am the best, I am real

1938
02:31:15,260 --> 02:31:18,260
I am scary, I'm insane

1939
02:31:18,260 --> 02:31:22,260
I'm a loner, I am cold

1940
02:31:22,260 --> 02:31:25,760
I feel fresh when people come home

1941
02:31:25,760 --> 02:31:29,260
I am nothing, I am dead

1942
02:31:29,260 --> 02:31:32,760
I am scary, I'm in pain

1943
02:31:32,760 --> 02:31:36,260
I'm in order, I am home

1944
02:31:36,260 --> 02:31:41,260
I feel infected when people don't know

1945
02:31:41,260 --> 02:32:08,260
And when I say I'm already gone Will I forget everything I've got so far?

1946
02:35:08,260 --> 02:35:22,380
After this song, we'll be having a Let Them Move marathon.

1947
02:35:22,380 --> 02:35:23,380
No!

1948
02:35:23,380 --> 02:35:25,860
Just kidding.

1949
02:35:25,860 --> 02:35:28,980
Orange Lounge Radio, crap-free Bhavani radio.

1950
02:35:28,980 --> 02:35:31,780
Welcome back, boys and girls.

1951
02:35:31,780 --> 02:35:36,100
I hope you enjoyed that break of sadness and tragicness.

1952
02:35:36,100 --> 02:35:37,740
Deutz de Fatima.

1953
02:35:37,740 --> 02:35:40,420
Ghosts, I am gothic and silhouette of my mind.

1954
02:35:40,420 --> 02:35:45,100
That was a pretty emotional break, I think I had a movement in my bowels during that

1955
02:35:45,100 --> 02:35:46,100
break.

1956
02:35:46,100 --> 02:35:52,660
We're going to do a little bit of Ask Orange Lounge, but first actually we're going to

1957
02:35:52,660 --> 02:35:55,700
go to our Skype line and open it up one more time there.

1958
02:35:55,700 --> 02:36:01,460
It's www.orangeloungeradio.com and click on interact with us if you wish to call the show.

1959
02:36:01,460 --> 02:36:03,020
And oh look, we're already getting a call.

1960
02:36:03,020 --> 02:36:04,980
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

1961
02:36:04,980 --> 02:36:06,980
Hey, hey, hey, it's Ron Shawn.

1962
02:36:06,980 --> 02:36:09,860
Hello Ron-Chan, how are you my friend?

1963
02:36:09,860 --> 02:36:11,660
I'm good, how are you guys?

1964
02:36:11,660 --> 02:36:13,340
Good, what's on your mind?

1965
02:36:13,340 --> 02:36:15,860
I have a couple of things I want to talk about real quick.

1966
02:36:15,860 --> 02:36:19,860
First, I played Flow, the urban dance groove.

1967
02:36:19,860 --> 02:36:24,180
Can you get yourself a little closer to your mic by the way, we're having a hard time hearing you.

1968
02:36:24,180 --> 02:36:26,780
But you got to play Flow?

1969
02:36:26,780 --> 02:36:30,980
Yeah, the urban dance groove. Much better, okay, how was that?

1970
02:36:30,980 --> 02:36:33,980
It's Def Jam meets Dance Dance Revolution.

1971
02:36:33,980 --> 02:36:35,980
Is this a good thing or a bad thing?

1972
02:36:35,980 --> 02:36:41,980
I don't know. At first I felt kind of offended it was so bad, but yet it was just so funny.

1973
02:36:41,980 --> 02:36:43,980
What kind of songs are in this game?

1974
02:36:43,980 --> 02:36:51,980
There's a lot of old-school stuff like this, and there's a lot of new-school stuff I've never heard of.

1975
02:36:51,980 --> 02:36:59,980
That's cool. How is the interface? How is the design of the game? Does it flow?

1976
02:36:59,980 --> 02:37:03,980
Pretty much it does. The dance steps are a little bit too easy, though.

1977
02:37:03,980 --> 02:37:07,980
Really? No really hard mode or anything?

1978
02:37:07,980 --> 02:37:11,980
I think the levels are like DDR Mario Mix.

1979
02:37:11,980 --> 02:37:15,980
Ooh, that's no good. Well, okay, but I guess if you're new to

1980
02:37:15,980 --> 02:37:19,980
dance games, which maybe they're thinking the target audience for Flow is

1981
02:37:19,980 --> 02:37:23,980
or is not the same group that plays DDR or whatever, I don't know,

1982
02:37:23,980 --> 02:37:27,980
maybe that's just a warm-up. I don't know.

1983
02:37:27,980 --> 02:37:31,980
I don't even know what UbiSoft is thinking

1984
02:37:31,980 --> 02:37:37,500
because I remember one day I'm coming home and I see fliers for 187 ride or

1985
02:37:37,500 --> 02:37:43,580
die and that game was really horrible. I think they're trying to get

1986
02:37:43,580 --> 02:37:48,300
black people to play video games more or something like that. Do black people

1987
02:37:48,300 --> 02:37:52,460
already play video games? I don't know. Yeah. But this is the French, what do they

1988
02:37:52,460 --> 02:38:02,500
know but but what this is the French what do they know Wow okay a lot of

1989
02:38:02,500 --> 02:38:06,900
people a lot of black people play video games I don't at least when I watch the

1990
02:38:06,900 --> 02:38:11,460
video game video game Awards on Spike TV I would have thought only black people

1991
02:38:11,460 --> 02:38:16,420
play games for the parts I watched I don't know if it was just me I tell you

1992
02:38:16,420 --> 02:38:21,420
When I play DDR, I know I don't feel alone when I play.

1993
02:38:21,420 --> 02:38:28,700
Anyway, okay, raised stuff aside, how does Flow stack up?

1994
02:38:28,700 --> 02:38:33,020
Is it a worthy purchase for the music game fan, or is it a piece of crap?

1995
02:38:33,020 --> 02:38:35,020
Wait till it drops to 19.

1996
02:38:35,020 --> 02:38:36,980
Wait till it drops to 19, is that with...

1997
02:38:36,980 --> 02:38:38,940
Oh no, because it's for PlayStation, right?

1998
02:38:38,940 --> 02:38:39,940
Yeah.

1999
02:38:39,940 --> 02:38:42,060
Okay, so that you can get the pads set away, okay.

2000
02:38:42,060 --> 02:38:43,660
Wait for it to drop to 19.

2001
02:38:43,660 --> 02:38:49,100
has a question can you crunk in the game only when you buy a 40 ounce to go with

2002
02:38:49,100 --> 02:38:56,940
it nice all right anything else going on in the world around him a couple of

2003
02:38:56,940 --> 02:39:01,420
things to answer Loki's question I've actually seen people drink a full bottle

2004
02:39:01,420 --> 02:39:07,700
of pork syrup and get crazy at the raves did you hear that Loki you've seen

2005
02:39:07,700 --> 02:39:11,220
people drink the bottle of cough syrup and get crazy at the raves just you know

2006
02:39:11,220 --> 02:39:16,980
So listen to Rebel Testament, MC Chris.

2007
02:39:16,980 --> 02:39:22,140
And this one is for you, Jamie.

2008
02:39:22,140 --> 02:39:26,660
I was coming home off of work tonight and this kid was asking his mom about getting

2009
02:39:26,660 --> 02:39:27,660
GTA.

2010
02:39:27,660 --> 02:39:33,780
And she's like, no, you can't get it because you're too young for it, end of story.

2011
02:39:33,780 --> 02:39:37,220
So he starts getting all mad and she's like, I'm going to ask my father to get it.

2012
02:39:37,220 --> 02:39:40,700
She's like, well, you do that, you're still not going to get it, don't tell him not to.

2013
02:39:40,700 --> 02:39:45,660
And then he goes, you know what, fuck you, I'm gonna get it anyway.

2014
02:39:45,660 --> 02:39:48,440
The next part was priceless.

2015
02:39:48,440 --> 02:39:51,980
She grabbed him by his baggy pants, like, you wanna say fuck you, you wanna say fuck

2016
02:39:51,980 --> 02:39:52,980
you?

2017
02:39:52,980 --> 02:39:56,180
She proceeded to beat his ass.

2018
02:39:56,180 --> 02:39:57,180
That is beautiful.

2019
02:39:57,180 --> 02:39:58,180
Good.

2020
02:39:58,180 --> 02:40:00,140
That is a mama doing her job.

2021
02:40:00,140 --> 02:40:05,420
Nothing good like a good old public humiliation to put a kid in his place.

2022
02:40:05,420 --> 02:40:09,740
That is our mom of the week, we don't know a name for the mom?

2023
02:40:09,740 --> 02:40:14,060
No, because I was just walking up and down the platform waiting for my train and I just

2024
02:40:14,060 --> 02:40:15,460
started listening into the conversation.

2025
02:40:15,460 --> 02:40:18,580
What does mom look like?

2026
02:40:18,580 --> 02:40:20,340
Big mama, that's all you need to know.

2027
02:40:20,340 --> 02:40:23,620
Big mama is our mom of the week, congratulations.

2028
02:40:23,620 --> 02:40:24,900
Orange Andrey does mom of the week.

You know, we should solicit these parent stories for like parents of the week.

2030
02:40:29,540 --> 02:40:32,780
I think that would be a good feature maybe a little later on, like our parents of the

2031
02:40:32,780 --> 02:40:33,780
week.

2032
02:40:33,780 --> 02:40:34,780

we're going to get into Ask Orange Lounge in a little bit

2051
02:42:42,520 --> 02:42:45,860
but first i'm going to log in the live channel so I can get that link here that

2052
02:42:45,860 --> 02:42:48,440
DarkSakura posted there in her blog

2053
02:42:48,440 --> 02:42:49,800
now what

2054
02:42:49,800 --> 02:42:52,720
i gotta bring it up here though so that i can

2055
02:42:52,720 --> 02:42:57,220
get the audio out now tell us again what this thing is all about here that we're going to watch

2056
02:42:57,220 --> 02:43:02,740
the proper way to uh... eat sushi um... even directions as to how you enter the

2057
02:43:02,740 --> 02:43:03,860
place

2058
02:43:03,860 --> 02:43:06,940
to how you pour your beer for people

2059
02:43:06,940 --> 02:43:08,820
and really a lot of that is just

2060
02:43:08,820 --> 02:43:11,980
polite custom but it's really over blowing it

2061
02:43:11,980 --> 02:43:15,360
it's really funny it totally makes fun of a lot of things that people do at sushi

2062
02:43:15,360 --> 02:43:16,160
restaurants

2063
02:43:16,160 --> 02:43:17,620
now it's not

2064
02:43:17,620 --> 02:43:19,180
super long is it

2065
02:43:19,180 --> 02:43:22,500
uh...

2066
02:43:22,500 --> 02:43:25,000
We'll let it kind of start here, and if it's too long, then we'll just kind of...

2067
02:43:25,000 --> 02:43:26,500
Might have to translate.

2068
02:43:35,500 --> 02:43:37,500
The snack most commonly associated with Japan.

2069
02:43:39,000 --> 02:43:41,500
A shop that sells sushi is called a sushi-a.

2070
02:43:42,500 --> 02:43:45,000
Most Japanese eat at one every day.

2071
02:43:48,500 --> 02:43:50,000
This is the entrance to a sushi-a.

2072
02:43:50,000 --> 02:43:57,280
To pass through the short curtain called Noren, from the lower left corner of the third partition,

2073
02:43:57,280 --> 02:44:02,120
find the spot 3.2 inches up at an angle of 48 degrees, place your hand like this and

2074
02:44:02,120 --> 02:44:04,320
peel open.

2075
02:44:04,320 --> 02:44:15,000
If you arrive less than 30 minutes before closing, ask, are you still open?

2076
02:44:15,000 --> 02:44:22,800
On entering the premises, inside, two people, this is the number in your group, in a group

2077
02:44:22,800 --> 02:44:28,840
of three, say, three people, in a group of four, say, okay, this is getting boring, when

2078
02:44:28,840 --> 02:44:29,840
does this get good?

2079
02:44:29,840 --> 02:44:35,160
It's just the whole thing is silly, you should always show a little guilt in your eyes if

2080
02:44:35,160 --> 02:44:36,160
you're alone.

2081
02:44:36,160 --> 02:44:40,880
Why would you be guilty if you're alone, what if you're on business or something?

2082
02:44:40,880 --> 02:44:45,620
You know, we actually, we used to have a place here locally called Sushiya, so I think that's

2083
02:44:45,620 --> 02:44:46,620
kind of funny though.

2084
02:44:46,620 --> 02:44:49,620
I know, I'm sad that Sushiya is closed.

2085
02:44:49,620 --> 02:44:52,180
You have to ask people to save my day.

2086
02:44:52,180 --> 02:44:54,020
These two men look like they're going to get it on.

2087
02:44:54,020 --> 02:44:55,020
No.

2088
02:44:55,020 --> 02:44:56,020
They were hella flirting.

2089
02:44:56,020 --> 02:44:57,020
Did you see that?

2090
02:44:57,020 --> 02:44:58,020
Is this seat taken?

2091
02:44:58,020 --> 02:45:03,020
I was supposed to do this in the chat room.

2092
02:45:03,020 --> 02:45:05,020
Yeah, post the link in the chat room.

2093
02:45:05,020 --> 02:45:06,020
It's hilarious.

2094
02:45:06,020 --> 02:45:07,020
All right.

2095
02:45:07,020 --> 02:45:08,020
That would be fun.

2096
02:45:08,020 --> 02:45:10,020
I had Blanca that came in my town.

2097
02:45:10,020 --> 02:45:13,020
I think someone sent them to Crevin and Rebelton.

2098
02:45:40,020 --> 02:45:51,420
Let's ask Orange Lounge some stupid question, where will we find out this week on Orange

2099
02:45:51,420 --> 02:45:53,420
Lounge Radio?

2100
02:45:53,420 --> 02:46:09,900
Will we find out the best of 2005 or is the best yet to come in the next two weeks?

2101
02:46:09,900 --> 02:46:16,900
nintendo maniac 64 says hey loki what do you think about gay sex

2102
02:46:18,900 --> 02:46:22,060
now that's one of the best jokes of 2005 right there one of the best orange

2103
02:46:22,060 --> 02:46:25,100
lounge radio jokes of 2005

2104
02:46:25,100 --> 02:46:28,620
you don't have a response to that loki?

2105
02:46:28,620 --> 02:46:32,860
uh... gay sex that's sex and gay

2106
02:46:32,860 --> 02:46:36,180
hey loki what do you think about gay sex?

2107
02:46:36,180 --> 02:46:38,900
it's so much fun

2108
02:46:38,900 --> 02:46:41,900
there you have it

2109
02:46:41,900 --> 02:46:45,180
uh... sky what do you think about big dick

2110
02:46:45,180 --> 02:46:47,940
what the fuck kind of question is that

2111
02:46:47,940 --> 02:46:50,540
its size is relative

2112
02:46:50,540 --> 02:46:54,140
it's not the size it's how you use it

2113
02:46:54,140 --> 02:46:56,940
uh... when you hear my name

2114
02:46:56,940 --> 02:47:01,540
well username nintendo maniac sixty four what about me do you think of

2115
02:47:01,540 --> 02:47:04,180
the fact that you like nintendo i mean i don't know

2116
02:47:04,180 --> 02:47:13,860
I think about all that fucking snaking that you do in Mario Kart DS.

2117
02:47:13,860 --> 02:47:15,740
What language is the best other than English?

2118
02:47:15,740 --> 02:47:16,740
I like this question.

2119
02:47:16,740 --> 02:47:18,740
What language is the best other than English?

2120
02:47:18,740 --> 02:47:19,740
Swahili.

2121
02:47:19,740 --> 02:47:20,740
Loki?

2122
02:47:20,740 --> 02:47:23,740
What's the best language?

2123
02:47:23,740 --> 02:47:24,740
Other than English.

2124
02:47:24,740 --> 02:47:25,740
Finnish.

2125
02:47:25,740 --> 02:47:26,740
Other than English?

2126
02:47:26,740 --> 02:47:27,740
Swedish.

2127
02:47:27,740 --> 02:47:32,740
I would say Pig Latin.

2128
02:47:32,740 --> 02:47:56,500
I am going to say something on record.

2129
02:47:56,500 --> 02:47:59,100
I am taking flash next semester.

2130
02:47:59,100 --> 02:48:06,620
She's going to make her own YTMNDs, I'm very excited about that.

2131
02:48:06,620 --> 02:48:10,260
No I'm not, I'm going to make something special.

2132
02:48:10,260 --> 02:48:13,340
Rini would like to know, is Akira Yamaoka gay?

2133
02:48:13,340 --> 02:48:17,300
I hope not, because he's going to be my next husband.

2134
02:48:17,300 --> 02:48:21,140
I saw this on some web forum, they were seriously debating if he was gay or not.

2135
02:48:21,140 --> 02:48:25,820
I could swear that there's some interview out there, and Rice Princess pointed this

2136
02:48:25,820 --> 02:48:30,420
out to me where he said that the first song he wrote or one of the songs he wrote on piano

2137
02:48:30,420 --> 02:48:35,560
was about some girl. So I don't think he's gay and when I, you know, I am gay so I have

2138
02:48:35,560 --> 02:48:39,000
gaydar. When I met him, cause I actually met him at E3 a couple years ago, he didn't strike

2139
02:48:39,000 --> 02:48:44,000
me as gay. So, does it really matter though? He struck me as hot. Does it really matter

2140
02:48:44,000 --> 02:48:48,400
if he's gay? Although the shirt he wore was kinda gay. I mean that was gay. But, but that's

2141
02:48:48,400 --> 02:48:52,260
okay. I don't really care if he's gay or not. He just, he can make good music. But I know

2142
02:48:52,260 --> 02:48:59,260
I know that's a big controversial thing on the internet right now. Who cares?

2143
02:48:59,840 --> 02:49:02,860
What is the...oh, maybe that's why we got rid of this microphone. This is the buzzing

2144
02:49:02,860 --> 02:49:07,620
microphone. We'll see. And what is the ultimate Bahmani song when listened to in moderation?

2145
02:49:07,620 --> 02:49:14,620
Ooh, the ultimate Bahmani song. What do you think? The ultimate Bahmani song. Dark Sakura.

2146
02:49:15,980 --> 02:49:19,260
My butt, the ass mix. Stop.

2147
02:49:19,260 --> 02:49:26,260
i don't know

2148
02:49:26,500 --> 02:49:29,300
still like uh...

2149
02:49:29,300 --> 02:49:34,160
was that uh... moving on

2150
02:49:34,160 --> 02:49:37,340
i have a real fun place for drifting away

2151
02:49:37,340 --> 02:49:41,880
but also love love love and i'd just as you have to be in moderation i could

2152
02:49:41,880 --> 02:49:44,100
just listen to some repeat all day long skulk

2153
02:49:44,100 --> 02:49:51,100
from Ultimix 2. I just, I absolutely love that song. Love it!

2154
02:49:51,860 --> 02:49:56,460
Sockarena wants to know, how does one know if he or she has an STD? More

2155
02:49:56,460 --> 02:49:58,780
precisely, how do you get it checked?

2156
02:49:59,780 --> 02:50:01,980
How does one know if he or she has an STD?

2157
02:50:01,980 --> 02:50:03,940
Well, there are signs.

2158
02:50:03,940 --> 02:50:07,740
There's lots and lots of different types of STDs, so the best way to find out

2159
02:50:07,740 --> 02:50:09,260
really is to get tested.

2160
02:50:09,260 --> 02:50:12,380
Get tested for STDs, and that's how you're going to know, because the doctor can shove

2161
02:50:12,380 --> 02:50:13,620
something in your peehole

2162
02:50:13,620 --> 02:50:18,900
and find out that way. Or, you know, there's tests. You can do blood tests and things.

2163
02:50:18,900 --> 02:50:22,620
It just depends what STD you're looking for. I mean, crabs. Well, if your pubes itch a

2164
02:50:22,620 --> 02:50:26,900
lot and there's little things bouncing. No, not really. You can't always see it. You probably

2165
02:50:26,900 --> 02:50:33,900
have crabs. If something's wrong, go to the doctor. If you're itchy, use a cream. You

2166
02:50:33,900 --> 02:50:38,140
can look up symptoms on a site like WebMD, or I can tell you from my background, I work

2167
02:50:38,140 --> 02:50:42,340
for an insurance company. A lot of insurance companies have, well, oh wait, you're Canadian

2168
02:50:42,340 --> 02:50:45,340
So I don't know what to tell you. Never mind. I forgot he's Canadian.

2169
02:50:45,340 --> 02:50:48,340
So it's an entirely different ball game.

2170
02:50:48,340 --> 02:50:51,340
I don't know if they have advice, nurses, some things like that in Canada,

2171
02:50:51,340 --> 02:50:54,340
but if they have something like that, check it out.

2172
02:50:54,340 --> 02:50:57,340
They can call on the phone, because they have that here.

2173
02:50:57,340 --> 02:50:58,340
Insurance companies have that.

2174
02:50:58,340 --> 02:51:00,340
Anything else you want to add, Loki?

2175
02:51:00,340 --> 02:51:04,340
I just want to add that I drew a penis on Blanca's face,

2176
02:51:04,340 --> 02:51:11,340
and this will be going to some random user's DS out there,

2177
02:51:11,340 --> 02:51:18,220
I'm glad that a little kid's gonna see a penis on Blanca's face, and it's gonna have my credit

2178
02:51:18,220 --> 02:51:19,220
to it.

2179
02:51:19,220 --> 02:51:20,220
Good job.

2180
02:51:20,220 --> 02:51:23,060
Xander C. wants to know, why aren't more people happy?

2181
02:51:23,060 --> 02:51:26,500
I'm happy, so should everyone else be to happy.

2182
02:51:26,500 --> 02:51:30,180
But if they think about geometry, they should want to kill people, like me, because I am

2183
02:51:30,180 --> 02:51:31,180
the cool, right?

2184
02:51:31,180 --> 02:51:34,660
Dude, what drugs are you on, seriously?

2185
02:51:34,660 --> 02:51:38,220
No, I don't know.

2186
02:51:38,220 --> 02:51:39,660
What kind of things make you happy?

2187
02:51:39,660 --> 02:51:41,140
That's what I want to know.

2188
02:51:41,140 --> 02:51:43,140
I'm changing this question a little bit. What makes you happy?

2189
02:51:43,140 --> 02:51:45,140
Loki, what makes you happy?

2190
02:51:45,140 --> 02:51:49,140
Um...

2191
02:51:49,140 --> 02:51:51,140
Pleasure makes me happy.

2192
02:51:51,140 --> 02:51:53,140
Like world pleasure makes you happy?

2193
02:51:53,140 --> 02:51:55,140
Any pleasure makes me happy.

2194
02:51:55,140 --> 02:51:57,140
Okay. Dark Sakura, what makes you happy?

2195
02:51:57,140 --> 02:52:00,140
Um...

2196
02:52:00,140 --> 02:52:02,140
A day off of work.

2197
02:52:02,140 --> 02:52:04,140
I'm surprised you didn't say fire.

2198
02:52:04,140 --> 02:52:07,140
Well, I like fire, but I can get that anytime I want it.

2199
02:52:07,140 --> 02:52:09,140
You know, it's like sex.

2200
02:52:09,140 --> 02:52:12,140
So, but I can't always get a day off of work when I want it.

2201
02:52:12,140 --> 02:52:15,140
So, a day off of work just to do whatever I want to.

2202
02:52:15,140 --> 02:52:17,140
You know what makes me happy?

2203
02:52:17,140 --> 02:52:18,140
ABBA.

2204
02:52:18,140 --> 02:52:21,140
ABBA makes me happy.

2205
02:52:21,140 --> 02:52:22,140
ABBA makes everybody happy.

2206
02:52:22,140 --> 02:52:28,140
You cannot help but be happy listening to ABBA.

2207
02:52:28,140 --> 02:52:30,140
You didn't send this song to me, by the way. You didn't.

2208
02:52:30,140 --> 02:52:34,140
Oh, I'm sorry.

2209
02:52:34,140 --> 02:52:35,140
Moving on.

2210
02:52:35,140 --> 02:52:36,140
Actually-

2211
02:52:36,140 --> 02:52:36,140
What?

2212
02:52:36,140 --> 02:52:37,140
I know it makes me happy.

2213
02:52:37,140 --> 02:52:37,140
Oh.

2214
02:52:37,140 --> 02:52:38,140
Dare.

2215
02:52:38,140 --> 02:52:40,140
By the Gorillaz?

2216
02:52:40,140 --> 02:52:41,140
Yeah.

2217
02:52:41,140 --> 02:52:42,140
Or like Truth or Dare.

2218
02:52:42,140 --> 02:52:45,140
Truth or Dare can make me happy when, you know, things go my way.

2219
02:52:45,140 --> 02:52:46,140
I play Truth or Dare.

2220
02:52:46,140 --> 02:52:47,140
Never mind.

2221
02:52:47,140 --> 02:52:52,140
Because now with my new stereo, that song sounds completely fabulous in my car, and

2222
02:52:52,140 --> 02:52:54,140
I get really hyper and drive fast.

2223
02:52:54,140 --> 02:52:57,140
My car makes me happy, too.

2224
02:52:57,140 --> 02:52:58,140
All right.

2225
02:52:58,140 --> 02:52:59,140
Neodude Zero.

2226
02:52:59,140 --> 02:53:02,140
Hey, did you hear about all the new games in development for the DS?

2227
02:53:02,140 --> 02:53:07,140
One will raise your IQ as you play it, and the other teaches little girls how to orgasm.

2228
02:53:07,140 --> 02:53:10,140
That one's not coming out, it's a conceptual game.

2229
02:53:37,140 --> 02:53:41,140
I'm sorry not not vagina. It's not a statement. It's vagina

2230
02:53:49,740 --> 02:53:51,740
Tasty

2231
02:53:57,300 --> 02:53:59,300
What I don't know what you want me to say

2232
02:54:01,300 --> 02:54:06,100
Thank you for bringing us to crashing the hall good job you broke our show good job

2233
02:54:06,100 --> 02:54:11,100
So, since you broke our show, here's some more ABBA to make us happy again.

2234
02:54:11,100 --> 02:54:16,100
This show is just getting weird.

2235
02:54:16,100 --> 02:54:17,100
More ABBA.

2236
02:54:17,100 --> 02:54:18,100
No, we need more cowbell.

2237
02:54:18,100 --> 02:54:19,100
Please don't hear the reverb.

2238
02:54:19,100 --> 02:54:21,100
So, please don't fear the reaper.

2239
02:54:29,100 --> 02:54:38,100
You can dance, you can jive, having the time of your life.

2240
02:54:38,100 --> 02:54:43,100
Okay, this show's gotten too gay. Sorry. Too gay.

2241
02:54:43,100 --> 02:54:49,380
NintendoManiac64 says, can I erase someone in Mario Kart DS?

2242
02:54:49,380 --> 02:54:54,060
I won't even snake, but I will powerslide insanely on turns, so fear.

2243
02:54:54,060 --> 02:54:57,860
Unfortunately, they bring my Mario Kart DS.

2244
02:54:57,860 --> 02:55:02,820
Yeah, I have a copy of Mario Kart DS in the other room, but I'm too busy playing Final

2245
02:55:02,820 --> 02:55:03,820
Fantasy Advance 4.

2246
02:55:03,820 --> 02:55:07,180
If I'm going to turn that fucking thing on, I'm beating Final Fantasy Advance 4, because

2247
02:55:07,180 --> 02:55:09,220
I haven't beaten a video game in forever.

2248
02:55:09,220 --> 02:55:11,220
I love Final Fantasy 4, too.

2249
02:55:11,220 --> 02:55:12,220
It's so great.

2250
02:55:12,220 --> 02:55:14,220
So great.

2251
02:55:14,220 --> 02:55:16,220
Alright, but ask our chat room.

2252
02:55:16,220 --> 02:55:19,220
Because maybe you'll find some people in there that would want to play you.

2253
02:55:19,220 --> 02:55:22,220
Trade your friend code. We have a post in the forum now, right?

2254
02:55:22,220 --> 02:55:27,220
We have a forum post over there on orange-trader.com where you can trade your friend codes, right?

2255
02:55:27,220 --> 02:55:33,220
I actually did one specifically just for friend codes in all of the available games.

2256
02:55:33,220 --> 02:55:39,220
Because we had one for Mario Kart DS, but since more and more games are going to come out that have friend code adding ability,

2257
02:55:39,220 --> 02:55:41,220
I thought I'd just put it up there.

2258
02:55:41,220 --> 02:55:42,220
Good deal.

2259
02:55:42,220 --> 02:55:46,980
But be sure in that thread you say who you're adding, because in a lot of these games you

2260
02:55:46,980 --> 02:55:51,580
have to have both people on the list, so make sure you say who you're adding.

2261
02:55:51,580 --> 02:55:52,580
Alright.

2262
02:55:52,580 --> 02:55:58,500
Oh yeah, there's those other websites too, DSmeet, and I want to say, one of our listeners,

2263
02:55:58,500 --> 02:56:02,780
Big Red Pimp, had another one that's a popular DS meeting site, but you know, stick to the

2264
02:56:02,780 --> 02:56:04,020
Orange Lounge Cult.

2265
02:56:04,020 --> 02:56:08,100
Let's stick to our forums.

2266
02:56:08,100 --> 02:56:12,860
Lucien had another question and the question was, Waterloo?

2267
02:56:12,860 --> 02:56:21,980
I could do this all night you guys, I could do it all night long.

2268
02:56:21,980 --> 02:56:27,180
ACM Buddy Paul wants to know, Sky are you the dancing queen?

2269
02:56:27,180 --> 02:56:29,620
Actually I'm a terrible dancer actually.

2270
02:56:29,620 --> 02:56:34,820
No, no, no, this is great because Rob Haddad does the choo-choo dance, that's the only

2271
02:56:34,820 --> 02:56:37,340
way I can describe it.

2272
02:56:37,340 --> 02:56:41,220
Actually, I think it was Eddie or somebody used to label me as, I would roll down the

2273
02:56:41,220 --> 02:56:42,220
window when I dance.

2274
02:56:42,220 --> 02:56:47,020
When I play DDR, I'm always rolling down the window, the choo-choo dance.

2275
02:56:47,020 --> 02:56:52,660
I had never really seen you do the choo-choo dance until we went to asylum.

2276
02:56:52,660 --> 02:56:59,820
And now keep in mind, this is the goth night at one of our local clubs, and they played

2277
02:56:59,820 --> 02:57:00,820
Girls and Boys.

2278
02:57:00,820 --> 02:57:03,580
I had to go back in there because it was a blur.

2279
02:57:03,580 --> 02:57:06,380
And Rob gets out there and does a choo-choo dance, and I'm sitting there just watching

2280
02:57:06,380 --> 02:57:12,000
and I'm drunk off my ass. Singing along while Rob's doing the choo-choo dance is funny.

2281
02:57:12,000 --> 02:57:20,000
It's not so much the choo-choo dance as it is the white people dance. You know, somebody

2282
02:57:20,000 --> 02:57:25,100
needs to teach me how to dance. See, I needed to be, I need to befriend, is this a movie

2283
02:57:25,100 --> 02:57:31,720
somewhere maybe? I needed to befriend a black person with rhythm to teach me how to dance

2284
02:57:31,720 --> 02:57:36,340
and like I enter a competition and win a lot of money. Is that White Men Can't Jump?

2285
02:57:36,340 --> 02:57:43,040
I don't know no the only thing I remember about that movie is what's her

2286
02:57:43,040 --> 02:57:49,800
name who decided that she was gonna be on Jeopardy that's the only thing about

2287
02:57:49,800 --> 02:57:57,840
that movie I remember I don't know I don't remember any of that I actually

2288
02:57:57,840 --> 02:58:01,760
ever saw that movie something I should probably share there I never even saw

2289
02:58:01,760 --> 02:58:06,160
that movie some folks in the chat room are getting a little angsty because

2290
02:58:06,160 --> 02:58:10,440
are playing so much ABBA, and they want to hear some disco prints from WeHawk Heart Katamari,

2291
02:58:10,440 --> 02:58:12,560
I don't know, maybe like as alternate disco, so.

2292
02:58:12,560 --> 02:58:17,560
That's all you get.

2293
02:58:17,560 --> 02:58:26,560
That reminds me, me and Mike Katamari comes out to BSP this week for the Japanese.

2294
02:58:26,560 --> 02:58:27,560
Which means I'll have it.

2295
02:58:27,560 --> 02:58:28,560
Really?

2296
02:58:28,560 --> 02:58:29,560
This week?

2297
02:58:29,560 --> 02:58:30,560
Yeah, the 22nd.

2298
02:58:30,560 --> 02:58:31,560
Sweet!

2299
02:58:31,560 --> 02:58:32,560
That's awesome.

2300
02:58:32,560 --> 02:58:37,560
No more ABBA requests. Stop ABBA- God damn, now I have all these requests for ABBA.

2301
02:58:37,560 --> 02:58:40,560
The secret of me and my Katamari is that all the music is going to be done by me and my...

2302
02:58:44,560 --> 02:58:46,560
They didn't do... Yeah, they did, didn't they?

2303
02:58:46,560 --> 02:58:47,560
Yes, they did.

2304
02:58:47,560 --> 02:58:51,560
I have a really cool song that they did, though, that wasn't in DDR. Maybe I'll put it in the cage match one day.

2305
02:58:51,560 --> 02:58:53,560
If I haven't already.

2306
02:58:53,560 --> 02:58:57,560
Was that, uh... Were they the ones that did LionEddie? No, no, that's SmileDK.

2307
02:58:57,560 --> 02:58:59,560
No, they did, um, uh, Takeiro.

2308
02:58:59,560 --> 02:59:01,560
Oh, yeah, I like that song.

2309
02:59:01,560 --> 02:59:02,560
Sounds pretty.

2310
02:59:02,560 --> 02:59:03,560
Good times.

2311
02:59:03,560 --> 02:59:04,560
Good times.

2312
02:59:04,560 --> 02:59:07,560
All right, well, we're going to close up the old Ask Orange Lounge, and you know what?

2313
02:59:07,560 --> 02:59:09,600
We're getting towards the end of show.

2314
02:59:09,600 --> 02:59:13,400
I know we still got about a few more minutes, but honestly, I feel that we're running out

2315
02:59:13,400 --> 02:59:18,160
of steam here, and we have a phone call we have to make before we get into the podcast

2316
02:59:18,160 --> 02:59:19,160
too.

2317
02:59:19,160 --> 02:59:20,160
So we got to call it a show, guys.

2318
02:59:20,160 --> 02:59:23,840
Thank you so much for tuning in and listening tonight, and I'm glad we didn't get the plug

2319
02:59:23,840 --> 02:59:24,840
pulled on us.

2320
02:59:24,840 --> 02:59:25,840
That's good.

2321
02:59:25,840 --> 02:59:28,200
That's always good news to not get the plug pulled on us.

2322
02:59:28,200 --> 02:59:30,200
Let's go around and get everybody's final thought.

2323
02:59:30,200 --> 02:59:32,200
Loki, your final thought tonight?

2324
02:59:32,200 --> 02:59:35,200
My final thought is, I just found the money rock.

2325
02:59:35,200 --> 02:59:37,200
Good job.

2326
02:59:37,200 --> 02:59:42,200
My final thought is, um, time.

2327
02:59:42,200 --> 02:59:43,200
Need more.

2328
02:59:43,200 --> 02:59:45,200
Darkstalker, your final thought?

2329
02:59:45,200 --> 02:59:50,200
Um, reject false icons and someone give me a cure for the plague.

2330
02:59:50,200 --> 02:59:51,200
Alright.

2331
02:59:51,200 --> 02:59:56,200
That's gonna do it for tonight's episode of Orange Lounge Radio, the final word of the show, one word to sum it all up.

2332
02:59:56,200 --> 03:00:00,400
Next week we will not be live but we will be doing something taped so if you're around

2333
03:00:00,400 --> 03:00:01,400
tune in anyway.

2334
03:00:01,400 --> 03:00:04,680
And of course stay tuned to the podcast we will have a new podcast one way or the other

2335
03:00:04,680 --> 03:00:08,080
we have to figure out how we're going to tape that but we'll do that one way or the other

2336
03:00:08,080 --> 03:00:09,080
and that's that.

2337
03:00:09,080 --> 03:00:12,960
Then we'll see you back here on New Year's Day for the first orange laundry deal of 2006

2338
03:00:12,960 --> 03:00:16,760
live and maybe some drinking going on we'll see what happens if you're good.

2339
03:00:16,760 --> 03:00:20,200
And then episode 166 now we have a fun month ahead of us.

2340
03:00:20,200 --> 03:00:21,200
We sure do.

2341
03:00:21,200 --> 03:00:24,760
Alright the final word of the show one word to sum it all up.

2342
03:00:24,760 --> 03:00:31,760
That does it for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio Live.

2346
03:01:14,760 --> 03:01:21,760
Holy night, holy night.

2347
03:01:21,760 --> 03:01:31,760
Holy sky, holy sprite.

2348
03:01:31,760 --> 03:01:40,760
Once your frozen mother was shot

2349
03:01:40,760 --> 03:01:49,760
Holy infant so tender and white

2350
03:01:49,760 --> 03:01:59,760
Sleep in heavenly peace

2351
03:01:59,760 --> 03:02:07,760
Sleep in heavenly peace

2352
03:02:37,760 --> 03:02:47,760
Heav'nly, all singing, Hallelujah

2353
03:02:47,760 --> 03:02:56,760
Christ the Son, send away all

2354
03:02:56,760 --> 03:03:05,760
Christ the Savior with all

2355
03:03:05,760 --> 03:03:24,760
Silent night, holy night, holy sky, holy sky.

2356
03:03:24,760 --> 03:03:33,760
Roaring, rushing, mother and child.

2357
03:03:33,760 --> 03:03:42,760
Holding in her soul, in the well of mine.

2358
03:03:42,760 --> 03:04:09,760
Sleep in heavenly peace.

2359
03:04:09,760 --> 03:04:11,760
Thank you very much for listening,

2360
03:04:11,760 --> 03:04:34,520
and we'll see you next week.
