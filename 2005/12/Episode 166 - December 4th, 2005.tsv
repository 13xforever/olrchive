483747	484467	You hate burritos?
484767	485888	Do they make you poop too?
485988	487308	No, I just hate all Mexican food.
490017	492179	Except for chips and salsa, but that's kind of borderline.
493240	497443	Have you ever had the chips and salsa at Chipotle?
497703	499084	Because they have lime chips.
499585	501766	Like, their chips have just a hint of lime.
502147	502487	No.
503147	504449	I've been to Sharky's.
504729	506110	They have really good chips and salsa.
506690	509332	And then just homemade chips and salsa.
511995	514296	They have good carnitas at Felipe's by my house.
515337	517459	Is that a mom-pa type place, Felipe's?
518044	519665	Subtitles by the Amara.org community
536934	537674	We should go eat there.
538014	538615	I know we should.
538795	539575	Because I love Grandma.
539635	540215	She's so sweet.
541036	542616	Let's go have a staff meeting there.
542636	545898	Wait, how do you say Grandma in Spanish?
546598	547118	I don't remember.
547138	547858	I don't know.
547878	548939	I'm sure someone in chat will tell me.
548959	549239	Anyway.
549759	551420	Abuelita?
551500	554281	Oh, that sounds kind of... Right, yeah.
554961	558723	Say hello also as well to birthday girl DDR Angel.
559523	560303	God damn.
560583	561384	See, now they all know.
561504	561984	Yeah, well.
562844	564185	Hi guys!
564225	565605	Happy birthday!
565725	567486	One year younger than you, sir.
567847	568947	Oh, so you are 34.
570228	571548	Sure, yeah, whatever.
572389	572869	Just kidding.
573009	573950	Hey, hey, they don't know.
574110	575130	That's always the joke about me.
575150	575851	Everybody says, you're 30.
576011	576811	I'm like, I'm not 30.
576971	578352	I'm good at being 30.
579733	580933	Yeah.
582054	582254	Yes.
584401	586644	So, everyone's going to scream happy birthday.
586844	589988	By the way, guys, I'm using the microphone tonight that sucks.
590168	591129	I just want everybody to know.
591230	593773	So, if I cut in and out, deal with it.
594692	594873	Aw.
595173	596074	When you cut out, we'll cheer.
596574	596874	Shut up.
596894	597495	All right.
597815	598976	We're going to take a break.
599036	603660	Then we're going to come back and have ourselves a show because we want to talk about DDR stuff.
603800	607764	And there's new videos for 2DX to talk about.
608084	611887	There's also new Guitar Freaks V2 and Drum Mania music.
612368	613909	And then there's dick and fart jokes.
614870	615570	As usual.
615730	616231	As usual.
616331	618713	Because it wouldn't be a show if we couldn't have some dick and fart jokes.
618933	619694	And musical burping.
620635	623077	We'll be back after this, and this breaks in Bomani Potpourri.
623418	627262	We're going to start it off with something I do every time I eat a lot of beans.
628563	630165	Drop the bomb here on Orange Lounge Radio.
630806	631607	Yeah, drop the bomb.

1022562	1026984	Will Santa be bringing you lots of joy and wonderful gifts this year?
1027404	1029165	Will he be bringing you charcoal?
1030305	1034467	Actually, I found charcoal, little plastic charcoals filled with candy at Target.
1034607	1035167	Oh, that's cute.
1035207	1035787	That's a cute idea.
1035827	1037068	I'm going to put some in Dan's stocking.
1037348	1042710	And I thought he brought just real coal, which coal is actually worth quite a bit from what I hear.
1043931	1046272	My skill in mining has gone up by one point.
1051505	1053686	Angel, what did you get for your birthday?
1053746	1055887	I was having sex with your cake during the break.
1056167	1059028	Well, her cake, she has this cake thing and it has a big hole in it.
1059308	1064750	So I didn't really, guys, I didn't really have sex with a cake, but I pretended like I was going to have sex with a cake.
1065550	1067270	And that was my way of frosting it.
1067290	1067630	No, I'm kidding.
1067650	1069831	Naughty, naughty, naughty.
1070371	1072472	I'm so going to get coal in my stocking.
1072512	1074573	You know what I'm going to get in my stocking this year?
1074653	1075353	A pig's head.
1075413	1077394	That's what I'm going to get in my stocking this year.
1078014	1080415	We're going to give you a do-it-yourself taxidermy kit.
1082847	1086991	If I get a pig's head, I would so deep fry it.
1087031	1088853	Anyway, I'm sorry, Angel, the birthday girl.
1088893	1090334	How was your birthday?
1090395	1091656	Did you get any presents?
1092737	1095379	Just this necklace thing.
1095420	1096260	That's cute, though.
1096300	1096741	I like that.
1096761	1100124	It's a fused necklace from... Well, you can buy them at ThinkGeek.
1100585	1102667	It's like this piece of glass that they've, like...
1103596	1107337	I got one of those, and I got a little model of an Air Force One.
1133582	1135183	Ah, another playing dad in my collection.
1136324	1137044	That nobody knew about.
1137064	1137365	Anyway!
1138085	1139166	LED guys, get it?
1141467	1142288	You're gonna do that?
1144569	1144890	Forget it.
1147151	1150113	Yeah, so, um, nothing much other than that.
1151376	1153017	I had a party in there last night.
1153557	1154797	I got lots of digital toys.
1155317	1155577	Yay.
1155617	1156918	That's cool.
1157778	1161019	Now, I was a bad friend because I didn't have a chance to go out today.
1161199	1173803	I actually went to, but the sad thing is I was at the mall for like five minutes, but most of that time was spent trying to find a parking space because my friend really wanted to go and run in and get something, and it totally escaped my mind.
1173843	1175223	I was like, I was going to get Angel something.
1176244	1177524	So I'll have a present for you later.
1177904	1178064	Sure.
1178124	1179505	It'll just make your birthday last longer.
1179525	1179925	Sure.
1179965	1180585	You can put it that way.
1180885	1182366	I'm gonna whack you with a bug net.
1195586	1196667	But I could do that in real life.
1197588	1199169	Well, yeah, you don't live that far from me, do you?
1200990	1201511	Hey, here's a rock.
1201551	1202631	I'm going to chop down your tree.
1204973	1206514	Throwing rock across this highway.
1206615	1206895	Oh, wait.
1207715	1208496	Anyway, yeah.
1209577	1213520	Anywho, well, happy birthday from us at OLR to you.
1213920	1215800	I think we need to sing to Angel, everybody.
1215880	1219781	We need to sing happy birthday to Angel, Orange Lounge Radio style, okay?
1219961	1220782	Ready, everybody?
1221382	1223282	Alright, give the mic to Loki so he can help out.
1223342	1223922	Alright, here we go.
1225163	1226743	One, two, three.
1227263	1230924	Happy birthday to you.
1231704	1235065	Happy birthday, fuck you.
1235865	1239926	Happy birthday, fuck Angel.
1239966	1240366	In a good way.
1240993	1246175	Happy birthday, fuck you.
1247595	1248976	I got a platinum record for that.
1249136	1250977	Somebody shoot the singer.
1253057	1254398	I should totally be a loud singer.
1255939	1258780	Happy birthday, fuck you.
1260040	1260460	How was your week?
1260500	1263101	How was your day, DarkSakura?
1263161	1268023	I spent most of the week having the plague, but I decided that it might be the T-virus.
1269460	1270681	Like, isn't that what AIDS is?
1271141	1272142	No!
1272182	1275744	Those are T-cells.
1276124	1278465	I pity the foo who don't understand the difference.
1279166	1282948	No, the T-virus was the zombie virus in Resident Evil in the first game.
1284209	1298261	So I figured that if you ever start seeing Itchy Tasty show up on my live journal, like the entry before that would be Ugly Face So Shot Him, and then the next one Itchy Tasty, then you'd know that I turned into a zombie.
1298621	1300943	And then of course I'd be in here eating everybody's brains.
1301503	1303004	Are you sniffing my spicy brains?
1304145	1305887	No, I wasn't sniffing your spicy brains.
1308257	1313378	So, um, but I did have fun yesterday because I felt kind of better and I had already made plans.
1314039	1326842	So, um, I went over to, uh, our friend Tia's house to, uh, make dinner, which I made chicken and green beans, which I will post pictures of in the chat room because she took pictures of the food I cooked.
1326862	1327562	I thought it was sweet.
1328382	1331383	And then me and her and her roommate went to the thrift store.
1332123	1335264	But on the way there, we were sort of like in the ghetto part of town that we, uh,
1335817	1339598	Saw Popeye's fried chicken and ate fried chicken in my car while listening to The Cure.
1342659	1345020	Fried chicken and biscuits with The Cure.
1345040	1348741	Friday, I'm in love with a chicken wing.
1349541	1351762	No, it's like listening to pictures of you.
1353755	1356618	with eating, chowing down on fried chicken.
1356878	1359260	What's that commercial that uses pictures of you?
1360681	1361382	Do I watch TV?
1362563	1364164	I'm asking hypothetically.
1364224	1365125	It's the Kodak, right?
1365345	1366206	No, that's two colors.
1366246	1367807	They show that before the movies, too.
1367988	1369008	No, that was like in the 80s.
1369088	1370550	That's the last time you probably watched TV.
1372712	1375914	The Kodak thing, they show this in the movies, too, you know, and they have the pictures of you.
1376075	1376555	I think it is.
1376575	1377376	It might be a digital camera.
1377416	1377696	I don't know.
1377876	1379858	I don't ever see the cursor laying out like that.
1400805	1404587	And there's another picture of me and her with cowboy hats, which I will post in the chat room in a moment.
1404767	1408590	I think that's going to be your new picture on whatever Orange Lounge Radio album art we switch to.
1408650	1409330	No, no, no, no.
1409590	1411891	I have to have the one in the plaid beanie, which I have to go back and buy.
1413246	1413466	Okay.
1413486	1415187	But, um, the Plaidbury thing.
1415247	1422309	Because we're all going to have new pictures, and there's a... Did I even tell you guys about the new intro for the podcast that's coming?
1422349	1425611	Thank you, Rob, for keeping us in the loop and making executive decisions.
1425631	1433173	I totally forgot about... You said that we could have potentially one, but that person is doing it, for sure.
1433333	1436775	But we have to screen it when it's done to make sure we like it, of course.
1437515	1437755	Okay.
1439856	1440376	See, you knew.
1442975	1443435	Liar!
1443455	1446318	Oh my god, Jamie's trying to fuck with me.
1446358	1447059	She is a zombie.
1447119	1447619	Off with her head!
1447720	1448240	Off with her head!
1448380	1448681	Kill her!
1452124	1452945	Butt!
1454386	1455207	Yes, I do have a butt.
1455267	1455908	It's very nice.
1456808	1457469	It's very big.
1458010	1458170	Hey!
1460026	1465792	It's time like these, you guys are glad we don't have the OLR webcam, because I just showed my butt to Jamie.
1466033	1470397	I didn't show the skin, but I showed my jeans.
1470778	1475583	I'm wearing tight jeans today, because my butt did get bigger, therefore my jeans are tighter.
1475603	1476544	Those are
1477204	1504822	I had the coolest jeans though in the 80s because you remember during the Samantha Fox days how it was really cool to have all ripped up jeans Naughty girls need love too Well I, my mom would not let me cut my jeans, I was so pissed off so I went roller skating and I ran into the wall And back then at the roller rink the wall was made out of carpet And that carpet burned the knees out of my jeans
1505422	1506462	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1535738	1560809	um but back to uh my life yes i remember being young in the 80s maybe just maybe naughty girls need love too it's one of my favorite songs ever i do not like big butts i'm trying to get rid of mine
1561949	1568014	Oh my god, well I'll talk about it during my, I made a I Like Big Butts reference this weekend, but anyway, I'm sorry, I'll get to it later.
1568154	1577321	I also found out during the whole time that I've had my degenerative disease that I dropped something like 16 pounds during the month of November.
1577341	1578462	Oops.
1579383	1580304	Because I couldn't eat.
1580324	1584447	Which is funny because I bet that makes you the biggest loser and you weren't even playing the game.
1585067	1585648	No, I wasn't.
1588117	1592901	I also found out that I really like eggnog flavored things, like eggnog ice cream, because I had some last night.
1593181	1597905	Yeah, the eggnog stuff that they do at like Starbucks and stuff, the eggnog lattes and stuff.
1597925	1598785	They do this at my work.
1599786	1600827	Good shit.
1601467	1605430	And, and, and, and, and, the eggnog ice cream at Baskin Robbins.
1605930	1609453	This stuff is the best thing ever, because I love ice cream.
1613236	1614837	Excuse me, that was my latte saying hi.
1616488	1619269	Anything else you want to share about your week and your day in the 80s?
1619409	1621029	I did really shitty homework all day.
1621330	1623590	And then after the show, I'm going to go home and do more.
1625071	1625751	I just thought I'd let you know.
1625971	1626231	Okay.
1626711	1627352	What kind of homework?
1627732	1630172	Illustrator this morning, Dreamweaver when I get home.
1631093	1633293	And I'm going to be doing my geography homework during lunch tomorrow.
1634834	1635354	Geography.
1636294	1637995	I'm so glad that class is good.
1639878	1641419	And I have jury duty on the 19th.
1641539	1644281	Billy, if you're taking geography, maybe you can answer a question for me.
1644822	1646983	Is Canada a state or not?
1649325	1650266	Canada is a country.
1650846	1650966	Oh.
1651267	1652848	Because a lot of people just say it's another state.
1652868	1653789	And it has territories.
1654449	1656050	I know, I'm just teasing.
1656351	1659593	Whoever thinks Canada is a state is a dipshit.
1659693	1664457	I just wanted to piss off Socorina and whatever Canadian listeners we have, so... No.
1665458	1666618	Didn't you just hear what I just said?
1666658	1668420	Whoever says that Canada is a state...
1669755	1671376	Whoever legitimately thinks that.
1671716	1673437	You know there's people out there that think that.
1673717	1674557	Well, they're dipshits.
1675798	1677699	And Canada's just one big state.
1677779	1684122	They need to be drug out into the street, and then someone needs to... And then the Queen of England is the governor of Canada.
1685963	1687784	It makes perfect sense that Canada's a state.
1687804	1690665	I mean, that's how Alaska's attached to the rest of the United States.
1691586	1698890	But they need to be taken out into the middle of the street, and then someone needs to get, like, a big stinky sweat, you know, sweat sock, and then put a tennis ball in it and beat them in the head with it.
1700498	1701018	A wet one.
1701759	1703661	Like, fresh from the football player's foot.
1706303	1708685	It's just another state where they have, you know, healthcare.
1709806	1710707	Anyway, I'm teasing.
1710747	1711707	Of course I'm not that stupid.
1711767	1713149	And dirty French people.
1715330	1721936	I do have to say, having known quite a number of French Canadians during my time of living in Mobile...
1724215	1726397	And I try not to make generalizations about people.
1727678	1729300	I prefer the French to the French Canadians.
1732122	1733984	I think Sakurina's from Quebec.
1735025	1736306	I know several people from Quebec.
1736346	1737367	I'm saying in general.
1739289	1740049	You make them cry.
1740069	1742291	Don't make our listeners cry again.
1742331	1743893	I wasn't talking about you specifically.
1743913	1745294	Don't make the listeners cry again.
1746195	1747576	That's like the third time this month.
1747796	1748737	And we're only on the fourth.
1749618	1750178	You know what?
1750298	1750499	What?
1753542	1755644	Dude, okay, right cola is yummy.
1757206	1758087	We're talking about cola.
1758187	1759048	I know, I see they're talking.
1759269	1762272	Dude, did Canada invent Tab?
1762452	1766176	Because if they did, seriously, nuke them.
1766196	1767217	Tab is awful.
1767518	1773164	I'm actually, I was actually suggesting to my, well, I wanted to suggest to my husband that we move to Canada.
1774065	1774706	It's cold.
1776387	1777948	I like cold.
1778948	1781028	Bitch!
1781989	1787930	But there is, and I'm going to go ahead and say this now, there is the possibility of us moving in a year.
1790871	1793812	That does not mean I will no longer be doing the show.
1794852	1795712	I'll just convert all my money.
1800714	1801575	That's it, that's it.
1801675	1806277	Next Christmas, I'm going to convert all my money to Canadian dollars and then go shopping and then come back.
1807778	1812461	We probably have other Canadian listeners who are listening and going, these people are jerks.
1813201	1817544	It's alright, we had to make fun of this continent for once, you know, because it's always, you know.
1818264	1823247	You know what, you know what, I love Canada because I could get gay married there if I wanted to.
1823427	1828850	But honestly, if I move to any country, it's going to be to the UK.
1828870	1829030	Okay.
1830211	1834275	Because seriously, I'm so pissed off at our government.
1836137	1837698	I hate this situation here.
1839300	1842323	So hopefully, I'm going to say this publicly on the air.
1842463	1845165	If any, I want to be hired by zombie flesh eaters, please.
1845205	1845526	Thank you.
1847708	1848028	All right.
1848528	1849389	Loki, how was your week?
1849409	1849890	How was your day?
1850936	1851917	My week was okay.
1852357	1856559	I kicked the crap out of the rest of my colleagues in Grand Theft Auto, per usual.
1857639	1862982	Now we're actually going to start keeping stats now, just because I want to know how badly I'm winning.
1865864	1869286	Other than that, I've been just waiting for my 360 to come in.
1869686	1873188	Talked to people at GameStop, and they haven't even gotten another shipment in.
1873368	1875749	So, yay Microsoft!
1876149	1886617	Meanwhile, Microsoft launched in Europe with less than expected 360s because, you know, those should have come over here instead of sending them to the UK.
1887278	1887918	Yeah, we got ours.
1888559	1889359	It freezes all the time.
1891621	1900488	Anyways, then I was also waiting for my accessories to show up at my work, and those still haven't come in either because Microsoft, once again, is slow on sending something out.
1900928	1902929	I swear to God, they just, like, screw everything up.
1903190	1904791	They really don't know what they're doing.
1906621	1918964	because you know it makes perfect sense let's go ahead we're really short on units in the United States let's go ahead and launch in another country so that they're also disappointed in our launch as well that'd make perfect sense
1921468	1926789	and then what next week they're going to do Japan and then Japanese just won't give a shit because none of them are buying it.
1928049	1931730	Actually, I hear more people give a shit about Xbox 360 than like the Revolution.
1931810	1932810	I was reading some article.
1932830	1934751	Yeah, because there's no info about the Revolution.
1934871	1936291	The 360 is coming out.
1936611	1938211	So, I don't know.
1939412	1951214	And then... FYI, boys and girls, we did just have a big ass net split in our chat room so folks are dropping like flies but, you know, life goes on so just keep trying.
1952381	1955685	Other than that, that's pretty much the main part of the week.
1955725	1960990	I didn't really do anything of importance other than kick crap out of my colleagues in Grand Theft Auto.
1962491	1963292	Because I rock.
1965595	1966355	Yeah, that's about it.
1968598	1969799	Alright, super.
1970460	1970840	Angel!
1971701	1972602	Angel, Angel, Angel.
1972682	1973122	How was your week?
1973142	1973603	How was your day?
1974912	1975372	Good.
1976173	1976734	School.
1977194	1977675	Grr.
1978395	1979236	Finals next week.
1979476	1979837	Good.
1980117	1980357	Why?
1980437	1981058	Because I get to go.
1981698	1981919	Wait.
1982239	1982519	No more.
1983440	1983640	Well.
1985782	1986363	Two weeks.
1987143	1988365	And then school's over.
1988545	1991568	And then I get to go back to my parents' house for like ten days.
1992228	1992668	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2018567	2020388	Um, yeah.
2020648	2021849	Oh yeah, World of Warcraft.
2022249	2023490	And we're all on the same server now.
2023510	2024531	That's pretty funny, isn't it?
2025231	2026412	I refuse to play on that server.
2027052	2027413	Why?
2028954	2030995	Because I'm already playing on two other servers.
2032626	2033627	People are welcome to play with me.
2033647	2034327	It doesn't matter.
2034907	2036788	I barely play World of Warcraft anymore.
2036848	2037468	It's kind of sad.
2037849	2039589	I do, however, play Dragon Quest.
2039869	2041590	I haven't played a lot of games at all this week, though.
2041750	2042651	Really, it's kind of sad.
2042691	2045972	Yeah, I've just kind of done World of Warcraft when I can.
2046192	2056897	Most of the week's been dedicated to school, so... Yeah, and then my birthday, so... Nothing really happened this week, per se.
2057098	2059979	Just World of Warcraft when I could, and then homework...
2060720	2071527	and then sleep and then school and you know the regular usual grind so I've had a very boring week aside from today so it's all good
2075766	2076547	My week and my day.
2077847	2078288	Pretty good.
2078508	2079288	I had a pretty good week.
2079689	2082951	Just really busy, work stuff and all that good things.
2083191	2084772	I really wasn't getting a lot of sleep this week.
2084832	2088155	Oh yeah, this was my week where it was like energy drinks kept me through this week.
2088515	2091177	And I never drink those energy drinks because they're horrible for you.
2091197	2094799	Like, Extifer, who's not here tonight because he's on the road right now.
2095159	2101524	Extifer was telling me about how those energy drinks sent his brother to the hospital for
2101764	2105428	because his brother drank too many of those things, like the Buku and the Rockstar and all that shit.
2106469	2108030	You've got to be careful with that stuff.
2108130	2112074	Use them once in a while if you absolutely need to, but otherwise, that stuff will kill you.
2112134	2114776	Why are your eyes lighting up like it's a new Christmas toy, Loki?
2115117	2118019	Your eyes are lighting up like, oh my gosh, I'm so excited, I'm going to go drink a bunch.
2119020	2119361	Yeah.
2120181	2121523	Because you want to go to the hospital?
2121643	2124886	No, I don't like the hospital, but I think I can handle it.
2125829	2126991	I'll drink that with alcohol.
2127011	2127672	That would be perfect.
2127752	2128453	Well, that's okay.
2128553	2131096	Like Red Bull and vodka, because you don't really drink that much of it.
2131136	2132879	But like, okay, this is seriously bad, okay?
2133359	2134981	Wednesday, I had a Rockstar.
2135382	2136744	Thursday, I had a Rockstar.
2137184	2138346	Friday, I had a Rockstar.
2138766	2139727	Not good.
2139928	2141750	I should not be drinking that much energy drinks.
2141910	2143753	You're sounding like Pam Anderson.
2148541	2162911	Good job, you're funny, you're a funny man And even though I'm drinking diet, I don't get what Can somebody explain to me how diet Rockstar is different from Rockstar?
2163071	2170176	Like carbs and sugar, but otherwise it's still bad for you Oh, it's just probably made with Splendor or whatever the fuck, I don't know
2170664	2176206	I don't taste the difference, but... I think that they're all nasty, especially Red Bull, which looks and tastes like piss.
2176407	2182709	So, actually, Red Bull, to me... Now, not that I really know what this tastes like, but actually a lesbian told me this, is that Red Bull tastes like pussy.
2184070	2184930	But it looks like pee.
2185510	2190633	Obviously, I don't know this to be true, because I've never really eaten pussy, because, you know, I am a homosexual.
2192213	2198256	However... Well, I did date girls in college and stuff, but, you know, I never, you know, did that.
2199176	2199436	Uh-huh
2226969	2229551	Anyway, I don't remember where I was going with that, I know.
2231032	2232314	Train derailed, show derailed.
2233354	2235316	Let's see, back on topic, back on topic.
2235736	2247927	Oh, let's see, I saw a friend of mine this weekend, a couple of friends of mine this weekend who I hadn't seen in a while, so that was cool, and I saw some Karaoke Revolution Partey.
2248567	2275881	which was fun and um but karaoke revolution party is kind of overdone for me now I think I think I've seen too much of it like if I hear another fucking person saying I will always love you I'm going to force them to drink a gallon of Red Bull or something because I can't stand to hear people sing those songs anymore um however all in all good times and um
2278419	2280180	I ate a lot of food this weekend.
2281841	2282602	That's about it.
2285023	2285964	I've been in a mood.
2286584	2289366	Actually, I have to say, I'm going to be absolutely honest.
2289446	2291628	I've had male PMS all week long.
2292108	2292808	I don't know what it is.
2293669	2304416	I suspect, and I probably shouldn't be laughing about this or bringing this up on the show, but I suspect that I'm one of those people that probably gets really affected by the weather, the seasonal disorder, whatever, because seriously...
2305251	2308954	I always get male PMS in December when the seasons start changing around here.
2309114	2309935	Like, always.
2311436	2314619	And so this week I've been kind of PMS-y and I haven't wanted to do a whole lot except nap.
2315199	2317041	So, that's the reality.
2318362	2320443	That's not me making shit up for radio.
2320484	2324387	That's the reality is that I really haven't done a lot this week because I've been sad.
2328667	2332590	Oh, I forgot to mention, I bought another game for the Xbox 360.
2332990	2335452	It makes a total of five now.
2336273	2337934	Five games for a system I don't own.
2338014	2338234	Yes.
2340516	2341597	I just find that to be ridiculous.
2341617	2343058	When are you getting your Xbox 360?
2343098	2343919	Have you figured it out yet?
2344920	2350724	I'm thinking sometime before the apocalypse, perhaps.
2351725	2354567	Well, they were telling me, they said by Christmas.
2355151	2356752	and they said I was halfway down the list.
2356913	2360816	However, I actually got to see the list and I'm not quite halfway down the list.
2360896	2364258	I'm more of, oh, I don't know, five names from the bottom of the list.
2364899	2366921	It's like, oh, thank you very much.
2368382	2370964	Have there been more shipments of Xbox 360 since the first?
2371985	2373506	Not to GameStop, at least.
2374066	2375227	We got ours.
2376468	2377709	Well, I mean, like, in general.
2377729	2380372	Well, yeah, but you have someone that works for GameStop.
2380432	2382013	I'm talking about average Joes here.
2383373	2394581	I mean, hell, let's talk about my boss, who, you know, one of our co-workers, you know, their boyfriend works for GameStop, and he ordered his after mine, and he got it on lunch day.
2394661	2395842	Gee, I wonder how that works.
2396042	2396763	Well, you didn't do that.
2398464	2399825	Well, I know you didn't do that.
2400826	2401866	I'm not talking about you.
2402327	2403668	I'm just saying that, you know...
2405737	2406757	It's impossible to get one.
2406997	2412178	But anyways, no, they haven't really gotten one, at least not at the GameStop that's by my house.
2412658	2417899	And I asked them if they had any more shipments since launch, and they said they hadn't gotten anything.
2419200	2421300	Maybe next week, maybe whatever.
2421360	2422800	But I don't know, it's taking so long.
2423301	2427101	And they're only making it worse for themselves now that they're launched in two different countries.
2427201	2429622	I mean, if they didn't have enough units before...
2430842	2430982	Dork
2445836	2446696	Well, I'm just tired.
2446996	2456578	The whole thing is I'm just... I have these games, and I've been waiting, you know, it'll be, you know, a couple weeks now for this thing, and I'm just kind of tired of waiting.
2456678	2459379	At $60 a game, that's about $300 in games you have right now.
2459399	2459939	It's all credit.
2460539	2461300	All store credit.
2461420	2464340	I paid not one cent for any of those games.
2466641	2467081	Amazing.
2467501	2468441	Yeah.
2468561	2470262	So, I'm not worried about that.
2470742	2471822	But the thing is, it's just...
2473024	2500576	I really kind of want the system now since I paid for it and you know waiting at you know GameStop it's going to take me forever even if they do get their shipment in I'm not going to be on that shipment so I've got to wait and I'll be waiting till next year by that time hell my work will have them then it's just retarded so I might as well just go ahead and you know pick one up at GameStop or Best Buy or whatever and then just you know cancel my pre-order there and get my money back
2501713	2505274	I think we should go and kick Microsoft in the balls for what they're doing with this.
2505754	2507394	I mean, seriously, this is stupid.
2507734	2510055	And then they keep advertising their system and stuff.
2510155	2512315	They're not in fucking stores, you morons.
2512775	2516616	I mean, I haven't seen any Xbox 360 in stores now.
2516696	2517136	No, they're not.
2518717	2522497	It's not around, and their whole marketing is retarded.
2523498	2524598	They really need to just...
2525469	2525769	Stop.
2525889	2528610	They should have, this whole worldwide launch is the most retarded thing.
2529070	2533670	Okay, first off, they can't really say, oh yeah, we did a worldwide launch.
2533770	2534311	No, you didn't.
2534691	2535571	You failed at that.
2535711	2540512	So, you can't even, you know, hold that above everyone else's heads.
2541272	2546973	They should have just launched in one country at first, a couple months later launch in another country, and later another country.
2547393	2548333	Poor Australia.
2548353	2553134	I mean, that's kind of giving you an idea of when units are actually going to be in stores.
2553234	2553534	March?
2555447	2560453	They better hope that Sony isn't like, oh yeah, we're going to be able to launch in a couple months with our PS3.
2560473	2564198	It's just ridiculous.
2567402	2567983	That's all I got.
2572935	2573535	Earth to Rob.
2573936	2574176	Sorry.
2574456	2588123	We're going to have a break, and when we come back from a break, we're going to open up the Skype line, and your comments, because it's not broken this week, and we'll have that.
2589423	2596187	So we'll be back after this mix of music from various Bomani games.
2597506	2604556	We'll be back with more Orange Lounge Radio and other news and some movie time, hopefully.
2697154	2711817	See together, see together See together, see together See together, see together See together, see together Yacht in the moonlight, you dance in the shadow Rain drops the dream of a dream The night is the moment of salvation, shall things ever run?
2732632	2734133	Thank you for watching!
2774105	2774766	Thanks for watching!
2881339	2883382	From the front, FZ-24, a rescue team is approaching!
2985836	2994382	Hiho, Kermit the Frog here, informing you that today's broadcast of Orange Lounge Radio is brought to you by the letter V, the letter A, and the number 59.
2994422	2999906	Can you tell me how to get, how to get to Sesame Street?
3000207	3013356	We're back here on Orange Lounge Radio, and before the break we were talking a little bit about our weeks and our days, and now of course we need to get into talking a little bit about what's going on with those music games we know, and love, and adore.
3013917	3014257	And, um,
3014497	3018361	I'm hearing that there's some pretty big news going on with Beatmania US.
3018802	3020884	A buddy of mine in chat told me about this.
3020904	3023467	I'm going to see if I can get him to call in in a little bit.
3024929	3026651	But I guess some big stuff going on.
3026691	3028813	I heard that the game festival was this weekend, right?
3028833	3032697	That was the big festival that went on in San Francisco where they had a bunch of games that were being shown.
3033458	3034099	It was kind of like...
3035700	3062872	E3 but the X Games or something so I don't know how to explain it what they were doing but apparently Beatmania didn't show up the first day because of a really stupid mistake not on Konami's end but on some festival planning end so they didn't have Beatmania USA the first day but I think it did finally make an appearance this weekend so we probably know a little bit more about it so I'm going to see if we can get somebody who might have been there to tell us a little more about it first hand however
3064192	3067575	We do have news about what's going on with Beatmania over in Japan.
3067715	3073079	Beatmania 2DX 13th style, also known as Beatmania 2DX Distorted.
3074880	3081985	Because I think they are going back to saying 2DX 13, but they're still not saying 13th style or anything.
3082045	3084567	So whatever you want to call it, Distorted I guess would be the official name.
3086028	3088430	They're actually location testing right now.
3089231	3091433	Some folks snuck in a camera.
3091453	3094155	This is like a high security place.
3094435	3096577	These kids could probably get arrested for what they're doing.
3096717	3103883	To bring joy to us all, they snuck a camera in there and recorded some of what was going on on the location test and some of the songs.
3104103	3109948	I haven't seen this, but I hear that there's a pretty awesome video for a new song called Starfield.
3111609	3115231	Sunfield, which, you know, obviously the name sounds an awful lot like Starfield.
3116051	3120694	But there's a pretty awesome video, and one of our chatters, Siggy, suggested that we watch it.
3121254	3122815	So I said, sure, why not?
3122975	3123455	Let's watch it.
3123995	3124896	So here it is.
3124936	3126756	We're going to do a little bit of Orange Lounge Movie Time.
3126816	3129018	This is the location test for Sunfield.
3129318	3131879	And you guys might be able to hear a little bit of the song in the background here.
3131899	3136001	Yeah, go with it.
3136021	3138162	Yeah, the interface is kind of easy, though.
3140256	3143257	The only one I saw was the Akira Yamaoka IP2 list video.
3143277	3144818	This looks a lot better quality.
3144918	3145558	Oh, look at that!
3145578	3147899	Little nice feed reader there on the side.
3147919	3148479	That's nice.
3149020	3151261	I think that was carried over from another style though.
3151281	3154682	This definitely sounds nothing like Starfield.
3170729	3177131	It's the BABY TRANNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNN
3200117	3201157	Oh, hey, Tran's all grown up now.
3201177	3202158	There's Tran, she's got the ball.
3202198	3203998	And now Tran is flying on a colored something.
3204118	3205058	It's a walker!
3205339	3206099	It's a walker!
3206179	3206359	Oh, cute.
3219088	3220908	Oh, is that like Mommy Tran and Baby Tran?
3220968	3221369	Oh, I get it.
3221409	3222489	Here, play with your head.
3222569	3224429	Time to change the diaper, Baby Tran.
3224469	3227770	Now back to the words I can't read because they're a bit of an angle.
3227790	3228690	Driving into a smile.
3228730	3228990	Ingrid!
3246064	3247365	And that's what the lyrics are telling us.
3247445	3249447	Happiness time, I think, driving us through the smile.
3249487	3251429	I think that's all the buzzers say.
3251449	3254212	Look at that, you can almost see the reflection of the guy.
3254252	3255573	We're gonna go have him arrested.
3269590	3280479	The video to iFutureList, which is over on that computer somewhere, it's pretty cool because you can actually see Akira Yamaoka really well in the video.
3281540	3283001	Let me describe the video like this.
3283842	3284482	One word.
3285223	3285864	Shades.
3287725	3291388	I swear to God, that was a part of the video that stuck out in my mind.
3291428	3291889	It was great.
3293170	3293390	Anyway.
3295359	3296320	Check that out, boys and girls.
3297361	3304068	Those location test videos are posted over on Bomani Style.
3304308	3305469	So you can go check that out if you want.
3305990	3308413	We post them on our website, but that's not really our thing.
3308633	3310955	We don't want to tread on somebody else's territory.
3311095	3316561	And the pirating of 2DX videos has always been Bomani Style's forte.
3316641	3317502	So have at it.
3320808	3322810	Alright, we're going to open up the Skype line, boys and girls.
3322870	3326673	I'm sure you kids want to call us and let us know what's going on.
3327353	3328354	So the Skype line's open.
3328855	3329375	Give us a call.
3330856	3331997	Hello, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
3334759	3335140	Hello?
3335380	3336701	Hello, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
3338022	3339203	Well, hello there.
3341024	3342165	Okay, I think I can get you now.
3342626	3343146	Can you hear us?
3344307	3345168	Yep, I can hear you.
3345428	3346509	And who might this be?
3348109	3350391	Oh, you're speaking two to one and only Mel to the Bizzle.
3350951	3352572	Hello, Mel to the Bizzle.
3352672	3354454	How are you, Mel Bizzle, Mr. Bizzle?
3356215	3364681	Yes, yes, okay, you're just a little, you're a little bit intermittent in it out there, but... That's, that's, uh, that's because Loki is downloading porn on the other computer.
3364701	3366122	I am not doing any of that.
3366142	3370125	He's downloading lots and lots of pornography and it's messing up our bandwidth.
3370145	3371146	Yeah, I like Christopher's computer.
3371366	3376610	And, uh, it was... Yeah, I'm not surprised that Splooge is, uh, getting through the tubes of, uh, connection right now.
3377711	3378731	Well, what's going on?
3379071	3380252	How was the game festival?
3380312	3381772	You went to the game festival, right?
3381812	3382252	How was it?
3383452	3390934	Well, it was pretty cool, you know, gaming music experience, but I think, and I know you can definitely feel where I'm coming from when I say this.
3391374	3395315	If you've been to E3, it's kind of like going to Vegas, you know, like of video gaming.
3395755	3399136	Everything's out there, it's so grandiose, you know, it's the whole nine.
3399716	3402997	When you go to a game, it's kind of like taking a side trip to Reno.
3403297	3403597	Yeah!
3404451	3405572	It's like going to Reno.
3405912	3408235	Yeah, I definitely hear that.
3409175	3414540	Well, did you see any cool new things there at the Game and Music Experience or whatever the hell it was called?
3414560	3417283	There's a couple, yeah, the Game and Music Experience.
3417303	3418324	There were a couple new things.
3418364	3425671	I mean, I know most of the Orange Zones radio people want to hear about 2DX and I think you kind of got the scoop that 2DX wasn't there until like today.
3425871	3426732	Yeah, I heard about that.
3427438	3435165	Yeah, what happened with the scoop was, I don't know if you heard the full story, but essentially, first off, Friday, they didn't even put the freaking ROM in the display case.
3435265	3437447	Granted, remember, this is games doing this.
3437487	3440049	Konami and, like, all the other companies, they're not running their own boots.
3440109	3443973	This is, like, all done by union members and, you know, like they really know about video games.
3444093	3447976	So putting a lot of trust in people and then them fucking it up, basically.
3449297	3453441	Yeah, so, okay, so, anyway, Jason, you know, he wasn't even going to be there this weekend, Jason, you know?
3453888	3456510	So he comes down and he finds out, you know, what the F is going on.
3456850	3461314	And so we talk to the, you know, coordinator, and then they say, yeah, we can't find a ROM.
3461334	3462775	Well, it's like, okay, great.
3462895	3467739	Not only is our game not being displayed, but now, you know, there's a loose ROM, and this could be some serious trouble.
3468039	3476625	So he has to run back down to Konami, get the ROM, and get, like, a debug PS2, and, you know, bring that back up, like, Friday, like, at midnight or so.
3476745	3479808	So, like, Saturday, you know, we figure we're going to have everything up and running.
3480088	3482650	Well, the geniuses that ran the, you know, the whole place
3483230	3488353	You know, put into ROM this time, but they used their own PS2 and not the one that Jason brought.
3488673	3491274	So what happened was you could play the game all the way up to select a song.
3491294	3493315	When you select a song, the thing froze.
3493715	3496797	And then when the thing froze, people thought, oh great, this is, you know, a bugged ROM.
3496857	3498478	This is going to be the best game ever.
3498958	3502400	This is going to be the best game ever is what they were thinking.
3504096	3505717	Tell us, tell us, tell us!
3505737	3506018	Tell us what?
3506038	3506618	Tell us, tell us!
3506638	3508320	Don't hold back anymore, tell us, what's going on?
3534480	3538363	Okay, so, alright, so 2DX, you know, I got to check that out.
3538903	3542445	The build looked a lot like, you know, 9th South, pretty much like what you see.
3542465	3543826	It looked a little cleaner this time.
3544167	3551311	As far as song lists, they didn't reveal a whole heck of a lot because, you know, of course they still want to keep a lot of their stuff under wraps.
3551431	3553513	There's a lot of new songs that he said.
3553873	3560978	But it's kind of cool the way they set it up because, like, you know how Beat Me is supposed to have 5-key and 7-key functionality?
3561687	3565268	The way you like it in a select screen, you can either choose Beatmania or Beatmania 2DX.
3565288	3568590	So that's kind of like a neat little spin on that.
3569030	3581894	And one little spin that, I don't know if anyone's mentioned this or not, but one thing that America does have, actually let's keep, another thing, well, actually before we get to that, another thing they keep is they actually use unhappy guy naming conventions now.
3582195	3586976	So now things are like beginner or easy or hyper and then, you know, hard.
3587437	3588577	So I thought that was a neat twist.
3589502	3602146	But like, yeah, the main thing that I heard that was confirmed was, you know, it's the how, like, when you watch top-digit videos, or like, you know, you play a song, you triple-aid it, and you think, oh man, how can I prove to people I did this besides the score?
3603186	3606807	2DXUSA will be offering, you can save your replays.
3608268	3611149	Wow, so you can save replays of songs.
3611349	3612789	Are you going to be able to do anything with the internet?
3613049	3613229	Yep.
3613990	3614310	Yes?
3614730	3615010	What's that?
3616967	3619329	Are you going to be able to do anything with the internet?
3620890	3622552	That wasn't mentioned.
3623733	3633080	I don't know about internet online play, but I do know that instant replays of your in-game are available.
3634241	3636022	Very interesting!
3637363	3638865	Yeah, you know, there were a couple.
3639025	3643168	And then we were talking about the Konami style, like the new US controllers.
3644468	3657122	because the thing was they didn't have it on display at games that weekend because essentially, A, it felt like a little bit, you know, getting tested out and stuff, and B, they basically didn't want to get it jacked or broken.
3657682	3664129	And you know how, like, when you go to a place that's open to the public, you know, 2DX will get, I mean, come on, Roseville Golf Land, enough said.
3664810	3666552	Yeah, gotcha, okay.
3667694	3670535	So they don't so much click, but they don't stick like the old controller does so much.
3694960	3701726	They have a little bit more click than the normal home style controllers, but not as much like total perfect click like say an arcade style.
3703647	3704488	That's the cover shot.
3717367	3718627	That's the cover shot of the game.
3718987	3719707	Yeah.
3719767	3720848	Are you going to be able to flip?
3721068	3724928	Well, I guess you could still do the flip around the controller thing for either side.
3725228	3725468	Yep.
3725989	3727289	As far as I know, yeah, you can flip it.
3727449	3730169	But it's weird because it's rounded on one side now.
3730229	3732070	It's not a completely rectangular controller.
3732090	3734730	It looks like a finger.
3736030	3738831	It's kind of rounded on one side, so that's interesting.
3738991	3741351	All right.
3741851	3745172	Anything else you want to share about what was going on with Beatmania?
3746583	3762456	Let me think, as far as like five key songs and seven key songs, I mean, I don't know, I can't remember what the E3 list was like, but as far as like five key songs, I remember seeing like Hunting for You, Bossa Nova de Fabian, they had Battle Breaks, which I didn't see at E3.
3763216	3763676	Okay, cool.
3765100	3766781	Yeah, Brattle Bricks, what else was there?
3766822	3769063	Metal Gear, Salting, Paranoia Max.
3769524	3773787	So yeah, that was like kind of default list almost for E3, except maybe like one or two songs.
3774328	3778411	R7 Key, I mean, the hardest song I saw was Shining Colors, so we thought I'd E3 also.
3778712	3780733	But they also have like the M-Step.
3780994	3782675	Is that song from Six Style?
3782715	3783696	Was it Six Style?
3783716	3784877	No, Six Style.
3784897	3787459	The Shotaro Hirata song, that's like the two-step song.
3787539	3788600	Oh, the M-Step 2-1?
3788620	3791262	Yeah, I know what you're talking about.
3791282	3791503	Okay.
3792657	3793677	Yeah, they had that song.
3793737	3796898	They had GMD on there, which is surprising.
3799499	3800480	GMD, okay.
3800620	3801260	Oh, wow, okay.
3801520	3803981	Yeah, complicated, like trigonometry.
3804181	3806042	That was like third style, wasn't it?
3806082	3807242	That's an old song.
3807682	3813484	I know, yeah, and the cool thing was they kept a lot of the 2DX videos crossed over to this version.
3813824	3817366	So, like, you know, GMD with the pop locker and the breaker, yeah, you get to see that on there.
3818006	3819966	Now, were the anothers there or not?
3820046	3821327	That's what they're asking in chat.
3822762	3832325	Um, another, I can't remember, I tried playing, like, Shining Polaris, another, but I can't remember if it was or not, you know, because I haven't played that song in a long time.
3833785	3843047	But as far as I know, um, well, from what Jason had told me, as far as another, I heard it's something you have to, uh, possibly might be something you have to unlock.
3843867	3845448	It might be an unlock feature then, okay.
3848462	3853843	Did you see any of the DJ art, the goalie art, the art that shows up when you beat songs?
3854703	3859565	Did you see any of the art, the artwork, the, like, the DJs on the completion screens?
3859625	3864206	They didn't have any artwork, like, you know, when you get, like, you know, the certain gallery unlocks.
3864266	3865526	No, I did not see that at the time.
3865546	3866847	They just only had the staff screen.
3867267	3867847	Oh, that's too bad.
3868947	3870648	But that may still be a work in progress.
3871929	3873470	Yeah, it's still a work in progress, you never know.
3873831	3884860	But I mean, I hear, like, well, the one thing that somewhat disappointed me was 5C Beat Mania doesn't have their old, like, you know, 16-bit or whatever, like the, you know, those little block type videos.
3885121	3886562	Yeah, the old style videos.
3886982	3894909	But they, you know, kind of managed to make it a little more sleeker and, like, more or less, you know, recreate some of that stuff.
3895189	3895810	I hear some...
3896512	3902556	Some songs get absolute total new video makeovers, but there really isn't any word which ones or just yet.
3903656	3908959	That pretty much sums up 2DX.
3909720	3915904	What I'll probably do is I'll post on Orange Lounge there a full song list that I did see there because I have it on my video camcorder.
3917933	3919836	Oh yeah, and what else?
3920017	3924704	Yeah, I think that pretty much sums up 2DX's game for today.
3924804	3932596	You know, like I said, a lot of stuff I was able to prioritize just, you know, kind of, you know, because he wasn't really there to, like, answer questions or anything.
3932756	3933037	Right.
3935191	3938253	Okay, well, I mean, that's pretty cool, though.
3938653	3942335	I guess maybe it might have been out there about the recording thing.
3942736	3943476	It was hidden.
3943516	3947378	Somebody in their chat room was saying it was kind of hidden on the Music of a New Redirection site.
3947398	3948239	No, it's not exactly hidden.
3948279	3949300	It's listed right on there.
3949340	3949520	Is it?
3949840	3951061	But I didn't know about that before.
3951101	3952081	Yeah, it says right on there.
3952101	3953682	It's under Game Overview.
3954403	3954783	What happened?
3955363	3957544	I guess that recording thing has been known.
3957644	3958664	I didn't know that, though.
3958744	3961886	Yeah, so save your performances and play them back for your friends.
3961986	3965627	Somebody in chat said something about it, that it's actually on the Music in Every Direction site.
3965667	3967148	But, okay, interesting.
3967228	3969488	I totally missed that when I looked at the site there.
3970469	3971949	But that's cool about the song list.
3971989	3974010	I did not know about M2 Step Version 1.
3974110	3975971	It does say there's also internet rankings.
3976551	3977111	Really?
3977131	3977531	Yeah.
3977791	3978232	Interesting.
3978312	3978872	Well, we'll see.
3979611	3986574	Well, thank you for the inside scoop, Mel, and we'll be looking forward to seeing the song list and videos and other reactions over on OrangeLoungeRadio.com.
3986594	3987015	Yeah, sure.
3987035	3991317	I might probably do a more extensive game write-up on Orange Lounge as well.
3991617	3991877	Awesome.
3991917	3993718	Did you see any... There are a lot of other cool things there.
3993898	3996699	Did you see any of the live shows, like Freeze Pop or Zonk?
3997940	3998540	See live shows?
3998580	4001982	You mean as far as the bands or the demos?
4002822	4003223	The bands.
4003303	4003683	The bands?
4005144	4005824	Yeah, how are the bands?
4007116	4009938	Oh man, yeah, yeah, I actually got to see Zonka Friday night.
4011059	4012561	Awesome, how was it?
4013381	4018866	It was pretty cool, I mean, it's like the first time I've seen the dance since the lead singer actually had her kid a couple months ago.
4019406	4019686	Oh wow.
4020867	4032517	Yeah, I mean, they always put on a great show live, they're one of those acts that, I mean, they may, I mean, they sound pretty decent, like when you listen to it, like, you know, your headphones are both, to see them live, they actually have, they have great showmanship.
4033786	4034667	Great, great.
4035427	4045695	I'm hoping that maybe we can talk to him at some point, because I want to ask him about Love This Feelin' and Tittle Tattle and all that stuff, so we'll see in the future, some point, hopefully.
4045995	4046336	Okay.
4046816	4052020	Yeah, I'll work on scoring you an interview, because, you know, me and Dave, you know, we gotta like that.
4052240	4052941	Sounds good.
4053081	4055483	Well, Mel, thank you for calling in and giving us the scoop.
4055583	4056163	Appreciate it.
4056243	4058025	Stay tuned to orangelaunchradio.com for more info.
4058652	4059514	Alright, no prob.
4059534	4060356	Peace out, people.
4060937	4063623	Time to go listen and make some dinner on the meanwhile.
4063983	4064364	Alright.
4064785	4065306	Take care, buddy.
4065346	4065687	Bye-bye.
4067921	4068241	All right.
4068381	4071183	A little difficulty there with the connection, it sounds like there.
4071223	4073965	But Mel, we can clearly hear him.
4074185	4075626	He's having a hard time understanding us, I think.
4075646	4078188	But we can clearly hear him talking about Beatmania.
4078548	4088115	Didn't end up actually getting shown at game until today, but it does look like that they are going to call 2DX is the other mode in Beatmania.
4089115	4092177	And then we have M2 Step 1 and all that.
4093898	4096300	Actually, I don't know if he said 2DX was the other mode.
4096440	4097161	He actually said it was 2DX.
4098141	4102003	No, it's Beatmania 2DX, and it's also Beatmania.
4102403	4105464	It's on all their screens.
4105824	4107625	No, it's in the screenshot.
4107745	4108906	I wish, I wish, I've been great.
4109806	4115748	Okay, but that's nice, though, that they call it at least 2DX, and like a little bit of a throwback to what's going on on the Japanese side.
4117449	4119450	The M two-step song is in it.
4120230	4121591	In My Eyes, Hitchhiker...
4122031	4124173	Well, that's from these screen caps we see, right?
4124333	4125814	Yeah, these are probably the latest build, though.
4125834	4128136	These are ones that are on Music in Every Direction.
4128697	4135903	I was the one, GMD, M02 step, version 1.01.
4136804	4138105	What a dumb name for a song.
4140046	4141808	Yeah.
4142048	4145531	We are getting hammered on the Skype line tonight, so we better hurry up and get to another call.
4145591	4146832	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
4147713	4148694	Hey, Sky, Siggy here.
4148934	4150055	Hi, Siggy, what's on your mind?
4151209	4157190	You forgot to mention V. Fuck V. I mean, seriously.
4157631	4158951	Fuck V. It's done.
4159011	4159611	Who cares?
4159831	4161051	I don't care about V anymore.
4161431	4163832	V was cool like three years ago, okay?
4165172	4170674	I want some W. Don't call back until you guys tell me that W's in it.
4170714	4174014	No, next we're going to have H for Handel.
4176235	4177537	Wow, that was nerdy.
4178838	4180761	Excuse me, I was a music major at one time.
4180841	4181382	I know, I know.
4182483	4193096	But no, I understand that the fanboys would be very pissed if V didn't show up, so we do have to mention some V. Well, other than that, I have to make some correction.
4194658	4194979	Okay.
4198883	4203386	You said that the 2DX13 distorted location test is going on right now?
4203966	4205587	It just finished, right?
4206828	4208069	But it just finished.
4208509	4213492	Oh yeah, I remember reading, I think you and Chad or somebody had said something that it had just finished.
4213533	4216975	But yeah, it was going on, so it just finished though.
4217075	4217535	That's too bad.
4219582	4223603	Anyway, are you going to play the Guitadora V2 songs?
4224103	4225504	Yes, I'm going to do it.
4225684	4226824	I'm going to play them next break.
4227064	4227445	Some of them.
4229025	4231966	I'm going to pick four that you sent me with cool titles and do them next break.
4233206	4236788	Well, go with the Vanilla Ninja song first since it's your favorite.
4237408	4238168	Oh, fuck yes.
4238228	4239108	I love Vanilla Ninja.
4239128	4240889	What song did they put in in V2 by them?
4242829	4244470	Metal Queen.
4245150	4245570	Sounds good.
4245630	4246291	Okay.
4246311	4247351	I'll definitely play that one.
4248732	4254374	What do you think about all this Beatmania US news?
4254454	4264556	I was a little disappointed when I found out that it wasn't shown yesterday, thanks to Rich, who was there yesterday.
4267017	4270778	A little technical foul up there, but now we understand what's going on.
4270838	4272339	What do you think about the recording mode?
4272399	4273699	I think that's kind of interesting.
4275089	4279671	Hmm, yeah, I'll think about that, but I wasn't surprised.
4280232	4300082	Yeah, seems like, I guess, I think, I think it shows that Konami might be kind of looking on what's going out there on the internet right now, like, what do the fans of 2DX seem to really get into, and what do they want in the game, and maybe they kind of picked up on the whole, like, you know, VJ Army tracking thing, and maybe they thought it was something they could build into the game, don't know, just a thought, I don't know.
4301710	4302471	Yeah.
4303352	4305254	Well, Siggy, anything else you want to share with us?
4306495	4311020	Well, nothing much else at the moment, but yeah.
4311201	4311401	Okay.
4311621	4313503	Well, I appreciate the call as always.
4313523	4315585	We're going to get to some other calls because we're getting hammered tonight.
4315906	4316887	But have a good one, okay, buddy?
4317267	4317488	Yeah.
4317708	4317968	All right.
4318409	4318509	Later.
4318529	4318669	Later.
4319370	4319570	Later.
4320413	4324276	Alright, Siggy reminding us that Gita Dora V2 stuff is ready to go.
4324336	4325937	He sent us some songs from there.
4326197	4327778	So we're going to check that out during the next break.
4328078	4330800	Because I'm excited to hear some of this stuff, so we're going to do that.
4330840	4331781	Let's go to another call.
4331821	4332761	Lots and lots to pick from.
4333582	4336624	Oh my gosh, I'm just going to pick the one that was on the line first.
4337404	4338365	Hi, you're on Orange Lawn Radio.
4340506	4340767	Hello.
4342127	4342448	Hello.
4342808	4343889	Hi, who is this?
4346150	4346710	It's Antenna Man 64.
4347762	4350625	Hello Nintendomaniac64, what's on your mind, buddy?
4352807	4355049	Uh, playing Mario Kart as we speak.
4355649	4356190	It's awesome.
4357471	4358132	Still playing?
4358192	4361355	Are you able to find friends on there?
4361415	4366239	Because every time I go in to do a friends matchup, my friends are never online.
4366360	4367461	I don't even bother anymore.
4371084	4373046	I pretty much do rivals mode a lot.
4374878	4383247	I haven't done Rivals, but I hear that Rivals is a good way to find people at your own skill level, so I need to do that one more often because otherwise I get my ass kicked almost every time.
4383327	4388994	So I need to get matched up against some seven-year-olds so I can have a sense of accomplishment when I actually beat it.
4389354	4389495	But...
4390035	4393557	You know, I actually played Mario Kart DS this last week.
4393617	4402320	I played with several other people that have DSs, and we actually played the mode where you can broadcast the game, you can download the game.
4402560	4409663	What I thought was kind of cool, and I haven't really seen this in a lot of DS games, is that you can mix and match people that have the game and people that don't have the game.
4410063	4413144	You can play multiplayer mode with people that do and don't have the game.
4413485	4416506	And basically, anybody that doesn't have the game will be a shy guy,
4416986	4441162	which isn't even a character that you can unlock in the normal game so I thought that was kind of weird because I hear the Shy Guy actually has like just a perfectly balanced average car so my friends are actually doing very well with the Shy Guy cars but everybody else who has the game will get to pick from any character and unfortunately when you're playing with anybody that doesn't have the game you can only pick from one battle track and I think eight of the typical race courses.
4441182	4446105	You can do anything in the first Retro Cup and in the first Mario DS Cup.
4447086	4447847	It was interesting, though.
4447867	4448367	It was a good time.
4449328	4455154	Yeah, maybe the Shire is supposed to give a bit of a handicap for those people who don't have it, so they don't have as much practice.
4455514	4455894	I don't know.
4457255	4463301	Oh, that might be a good point, is that they do the balanced car because those people don't have practice, like the rest of us addicts do.
4463681	4464302	That's a good thought.
4464782	4467305	Are you going to be online with Animal Crossing this week?
4471321	4473543	I might pick up the game, but maybe not this week.
4474884	4482470	I'm still kind of thinking about it, because I didn't really... I'm not too much of an Animal Crossing fan, but the online sounds really cool.
4483571	4484492	I'm excited about this.
4484772	4485072	We'll see.
4485392	4486153	I can understand, though.
4486193	4490336	Animal Crossing is a very quirky sort of game, so I can see where...
4491397	4495899	It might not be, like, you're jumping at the chance, trying to get it, so, okay.
4496119	4500240	Yeah, I'm very curious to see how the online stuff is going to work, too, because we don't really know.
4500640	4510504	I mean, we hear how things are supposed to work, but we haven't really seen it in motion a whole lot except E3, which wasn't exactly a tell-all type situation.
4510604	4511644	So, we'll see.
4511824	4512165	We'll see.
4513965	4515246	Anything else you want to share with our listeners?
4516546	4518967	Yeah, my L button on my DS is crapped out.
4519915	4520695	That sucks.
4520796	4522196	Can you do a warranty thing?
4522236	4523217	Did you email Nintendo?
4524498	4526679	Unfortunately, my DS just came out of warranty.
4527359	4528080	Ouch.
4528660	4530721	That is so typical.
4531762	4533063	But what?
4535044	4544069	We got it on a credit card that will actually allow us to extend the warranty for just, I don't know how long, but apparently they can cover it, which is really cool.
4545054	4554761	that's pretty awesome I never would have thought of that and that's actually probably a good tip especially this time of year for people that are listening if your shit breaks especially like
4555458	4556338	Goddamn my microphone.
4556939	4574627	If your stuff breaks, don't just check with the manufacturer, check with your credit card company because there may be some type of extension warranty or something else that might be available to you.
4574707	4575928	Sorry to break your ears there.
4578644	4580665	I swear to God, this mic is so fiery.
4581226	4588291	There might be something else available to you on your credit card warranty that goes beyond the manufacturer.
4588871	4589431	There, finally.
4590592	4591233	So check out.
4592954	4593494	Good tip.
4593554	4594615	Thank you for reminding us.
4596297	4599159	Okay, yeah, I pretty much just use the X button for items now.
4600820	4604023	But see, that's tough with the finger and everything.
4604343	4604883	I can't do that.
4604943	4605744	I need my L button.
4606625	4607445	I love my L button.
4609527	4620915	Yeah, I mean, at first I didn't think I'd be able to do it, but all I do is I just move my... My thumb is still holding down A. My nail actually hits the X button, not my actual finger.
4621375	4627062	So if I had cut my nails, I probably wouldn't be able to hit X. Well, a good incentive not to be biting those nails.
4627383	4628184	Don't bite them nails.
4628744	4629005	Yeah.
4629545	4630987	Except I just bit one of them.
4632349	4632709	Alright.
4633951	4634351	Alright.
4634692	4634832	Oh!
4636173	4636794	I got other stuff.
4637055	4637255	Okay.
4639720	4643742	Last night I went on a huge StepMania song downloading spree.
4644242	4644802	And what'd you find?
4644842	4645322	Anything good?
4648063	4658487	Yeah, I did find some official DDR songs and stuff, like Butterfly, Mr. Wonderful, things like those.
4659087	4659947	That shit's old.
4660327	4661468	That shit is so old.
4661668	4661908	I know.
4663208	4667870	I don't have any kind of PlayStation and stuff, so I've never even played the games.
4667910	4673711	Well, that's where the simulator stuff can be kind of fun, is that you can download the old shit you might have missed out on.
4675272	4679433	Yeah, and I actually completely recreated Sandstorm on every difficulty.
4680974	4681334	Wow.
4682294	4682434	Yeah.
4685629	4686689	That's a lot of Raven.
4689650	4698133	Alright, well, Nintendo Maniac, we've got to let you go because we're going to try and get at least one more call before we go to break, but thank you for calling in, and good luck with that L button.
4699153	4699453	Thanks.
4699593	4700514	Alright, take care.
4700754	4701494	By the way, I'm winning.
4702094	4702694	By the way, what?
4703795	4704215	I'm winning.
4704495	4706135	Well, kick some ass.
4707736	4708396	Kick some ass.
4708576	4709457	Have fun, buddy.
4709657	4709877	Yeah.
4710237	4710497	Later.
4714271	4716712	One more call, call, call, call.
4716752	4717853	Let's see, how about this one?
4718993	4719874	Hi, on Orange Sounds Radio.
4721994	4723755	Hey, this is SSJ100 Matt here.
4723935	4725516	Hello, SSJ100 Matt here.
4725536	4726096	What's on your mind?
4729237	4732359	Actually, I got some minor news for myself.
4734720	4739802	I got special advanced press screenings to the movie Grandma's Boy.
4740765	4746050	Grandma's Blood, oh, this is the Adam Sandler movie where he plays like a game tester or something, huh?
4746150	4746890	Yeah, yeah.
4747030	4748572	Did you actually see the movie?
4750513	4753856	Well, no, the advanced screening is for this Thursday.
4753976	4754377	Oh, okay.
4754857	4758600	It's not Adam Sandler, it's, what's his name, I don't remember the guy's name.
4758700	4759301	Rob Schneider?
4759681	4760622	That's not Rob Schneider.
4760962	4761963	I thought it was Adam Sandler.
4762003	4762363	I know him.
4763264	4764685	No, he, it's Happy Madness.
4764745	4765406	Alan something.
4766584	4770306	Happy Madison is the one doing the production.
4770606	4773747	I don't remember who.
4773767	4774927	Well, some person.
4776908	4778429	So how did you manage to get this ticket?
4780236	4788319	Well, the television studio that I worked at was giving out, like, it's like, okay, we have 12 tickets, who wants them?
4788660	4790840	And I just jumped on top of two, so.
4790961	4791641	Well, that was easy.
4791681	4792961	Those fell in your lap, didn't they?
4793141	4794382	That must be nice.
4794802	4795062	Yeah.
4796163	4808788	So, the premiere is Thursday, and they're going to make a big deal out of it, and they're going to have EA Sports going to be showing off games before the screening.
4810546	4811006	Very cool.
4811067	4812988	I'm looking at some of these people who are in the movie.
4813068	4815110	I don't recognize any of these people at all.
4815491	4818673	Oh, there's Rob Schneider is in it, and David Spade, and Kevin Nealon.
4818693	4821396	Oh, this is like an early 90s Saturday Night Live thing going on here.
4822341	4827342	Yeah, and the old woman from... Doris Roberts' grandma.
4827482	4827802	Yeah.
4828802	4829182	Okay.
4829582	4832483	I'm trying to look at the poster here.
4832763	4834023	I love Internet Movie Database.
4834043	4835743	It answers all my movie questions.
4835883	4837124	They didn't pay me to say that, even.
4837184	4838504	I really do love this one.
4840484	4843405	Linda Cardellini... Oh, they've got a lot of people in this movie.
4844425	4847045	Okay, well, that should be interesting.
4849246	4851306	Supposedly, Kevin Nealon's supposed to show up, so...
4854094	4859215	Hopefully I can give him my business card or something so he can hire me for a movie or something.
4859755	4860716	It's the Hollywood way.
4860736	4861416	That would be awesome.
4863636	4864997	What was I going to say about this movie?
4865237	4867277	You'll call back and let us know if it's good or not, right?
4867437	4867838	Next week?
4869198	4869758	Yeah, next week.
4871138	4871679	Sounds good.
4873299	4874539	Anything else you want to share with our listeners?
4874759	4877780	Besides rubbing it in that you get to go to a movie premiere and we don't?
4881752	4890282	Well, the movie comes out January 6th, so... That's not a good sign because January is when the studios unload their crap.
4891504	4893286	Didn't Resident Evil 2 come out in January?
4893586	4897271	No, but a wonderful movie called BloodRayne is coming out in January.
4897331	4900134	Like I said, that's when the studios unload all our crap.
4900735	4901536	No, I don't know.
4901696	4902297	It might be fun.
4902617	4911605	Just let us know if it makes gamers look like dumbasses or not, because I'm very interested to see what happens with another gaming movie and all that stuff.
4911625	4913486	Yeah.
4914007	4914287	All right.
4916709	4917810	Yeah, that's it.
4918251	4918811	Okay.
4918931	4919952	Well, thanks for calling in.
4920072	4920773	Have fun at the movie.
4920813	4921494	Let us know how it goes.
4921514	4921774	All righty?
4923436	4924177	All right, later.
4925157	4925398	Bye.
4926238	4926678	Yep, bye.
4927399	4928220	Okay.
4929360	4933524	Call there from SSJ100 Matt, who, by the way, is looking for a job in the industry.
4933584	4939388	So if you know a rich producer, he wants a job, so give him a job.
4940369	4941870	We want a job, too, actually.
4942710	4943351	We could use a job.
4943431	4948054	I would sell My Immortal Soul to do Orange Lounge on TV or something.
4948074	4948535	That would be fun.
4949616	4950756	I don't know how to do it on TV.
4950776	4951397	I like the radio.
4951957	4952638	Radio is fun, but...
4953530	4953830	Gita Dora V
4981109	4982830	Because it's called Twinkleberry.
4982890	4983751	How can it be bad?
4984171	4985572	It sounds too much like Dingleberry.
4985632	4986192	And then I'm curious.
4986212	4987273	We're going to hear a Tara song.
4987293	4991876	And I'm really curious if Model DD7 has anything to do with the other model song that's been in.
4991896	4992796	Yes, it does.
4992936	4993157	Good.
4993177	4993737	Then we'll hear it.
4994037	4995258	There's been like tons of them.
4995598	4995878	All right.
4995918	4996519	Well, we'll see.
4997459	5001702	So we'll be back after this with more Orange Launch Radio and maybe some more Skype if you kids are good.
5018095	5021756	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5060844	5061526	Thanks for watching!
5101952	5104480	Well, I only want love tonight Give me your heart
5129606	5130107	Tart, tart,毎日タルト、タルト、とてもおいしいタルト、タルト、毎晩タルト、タルト、やめられないよタルト
5156085	5161749	My favorite thing on that day was him, but if you compare it to a tart, it's too much for me, I'm sorry.
5162070	5166593	A tart, a tart, a magical tart, a tart, I'm scared of the aftertaste.
5166673	5169835	A tart, a tart, another tart, a tart, a sweet and painful tart.
5185077	5186578	Thank you for watching.
5186598	5187659	See you next time.
5207937	5209839	Thank you for watching.

5271440	5272720	Thank you for watching!
5297941	5301502	There was a time when magic suddenly melted.
5301642	5304203	It became more and more dangerous than before.
5304243	5305904	The tart was a tart.
5313733	5314854	Thank you for watching!
5314894	5316835	Please subscribe to our channel!
5343613	5350099	I don't want to be bothered by the noise.
5350159	5351881	I don't want to be bothered by the noise.
5370982	5374484	I don't want to lose hope in an age when the sun is about to rise.
5374544	5376004	I'm going to fly over the sky.
5376084	5377605	I'm going to fly over the sky.
5377685	5379126	I'm going to fly over the sky.

5476648	5477950	Thanks for watching!
5523386	5524306	and many more.
5570126	5574910	From the Step Squad to Orange Lab, this GDR sucks!
5575010	5578633	Holler, holler, holler, holler, holler, holler, holler, holler!
5583988	5585769	Welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio.
5586209	5590411	And in that break we heard a whole clusterfuck of music from Gita Dora V2.
5591312	5599376	And I understand that people are leaving listening to our show to go watch other things on television, like the Boondocks or Family Guy.
5599616	5602477	TV addicts, you need to get off of your butts.
5602737	5605659	You bitches need to get a TiVo or a BitTorrent.
5605679	5606199	Screw TiVo.
5606259	5608060	BitTorrent, yeah, BitTorrent is the way to go.
5608180	5611241	It's on before the show is even on.
5611461	5611902	It's on demand.
5611922	5612142	You can...
5612922	5617423	You can literally, if you have news groups, I do this almost every week.
5617723	5620824	When I get done with the show, I go watch my episode of Family Guy.
5621425	5622265	There you go.
5622465	5623545	After the show!
5623745	5624766	That's how you do it.
5626226	5628907	So I'm just poking fun at people that dare ditch us.
5629807	5631387	Because the government has access to it.
5632588	5634768	Oh no, the government knows I watch Will and Grace.
5635189	5635789	What am I going to do?
5639188	5640810	The government might think I'm gay.
5657412	5661854	Anyway, um... Where were we going?
5661874	5664095	Hail in a handbasket!
5664255	5666677	I'm driving this car, turning it around.
5667177	5672499	Oh yeah, I was going to get to the cage match pretty soon here because I know we want to do a cage match.
5672779	5673660	You have a song, right?
5673720	5676861	Well, of course I have a song because I didn't win last week.
5676941	5678742	I know, just making sure because I hadn't seen it yet.
5679143	5680383	Just making sure you had a song somewhere.
5681163	5682064	Alright, um...
5684733	5688074	I want to mention this really quick though, which I think, oh, two things I want to mention real quick.
5688154	5695116	Somebody brought it up in the chat room during break and I was talking about energies at the top of the show, or energies, energy drinks at the top of the show.
5697056	5701478	And somebody in chat reminded us about the Final Fantasy energy drink that's coming out called Potion.
5701558	5702158	Have you heard of this?
5703259	5704982	I swear to God I'm not making this shit up.
5705283	5708809	There's this new energy drink coming out called... Wait, somebody give me a web link.
5708870	5710513	I read about this on the... It should be Hypotion.
5710713	5711354	Internet.
5712597	5714220	Hypotion will be the one that's like...
5716075	5716435	I don't know.
5717035	5717716	Diet or something.
5717736	5718036	We'll see.
5719316	5720076	I want an ether.
5720096	5721517	I want Phoenix down.
5723458	5723858	Let's see.
5725218	5725538	There it is.
5725638	5728399	Final Fantasy XII Potion.
5728960	5729820	And this is what it is.
5730220	5731420	It's a food tie-in there.
5732021	5733501	And we're looking at it there.
5733581	5736522	Is this on... Oh, it's on Gamebrink.com is what it is here.
5738063	5739963	It's some type of tie-in to Final Fantasy XII here.
5740023	5741404	I wish I could zoom in on the product.
5741724	5744185	It looks an awful lot like balls or Powerade.
5744585	5748187	But actually I like the play on it because it looks like it's actually in a potion or something.
5749748	5752070	March 2006 is when this stuff goes on sale.
5752410	5757393	The drink supposedly makes you relax like herb tea and tastes mystical.
5757934	5764338	It contains nutritional supplements so that the company can claim the drinker might recover real life hit points.
5767720	5769721	And if you drink this, you're a nerd.
5770041	5771262	A really big nerd.
5773103	5773484	Just kidding.
5779329	5779789	What can you do?
5780510	5781651	Will I go up a level?
5781811	5783672	What was the other thing I wanted to do?
5783692	5784753	Will I do the little dance?
5784853	5785934	The little throw my arms up?
5787715	5789217	Have you played the Final Fantasy XII demo?
5789437	5790217	I like the bottles.
5790798	5792199	Wait, have you played the Final Fantasy XII demo?
5792939	5794521	No, and I'm not going to because I played it.
5794601	5795381	It's sexy.
5796322	5797443	It's different than the E3 one.
5797563	5798143	It's way different.
5798424	5800625	Not from what everybody in the universe else has told me.
5800665	5801606	No, they're lying.
5801886	5802226	All of them.
5803434	5805816	I love these bottles, they're cool.
5805876	5806857	I'll get it just for the bottles.
5808038	5808838	What else did I want to mention?
5808878	5810640	Oh yes, Final Fantasy.
5812441	5815764	On the cell phones, you guys pretty soon are going to be able to play DDR.
5816024	5829354	Why you would want to play DDR on your cell phone is beyond me, but they were showing this supposedly at the Game Festival, and I completely forgot to ask Mel about this because he was there, but he probably wasn't even looking for it because my god, who gives a shit about mobile gaming?
5829394	5829975	I know I don't.
5831496	5831716	But...
5832917	5835318	We actually ran a story about this on OrangeLaunchRadio.com.
5835699	5849946	This part of it is kind of old news that you can buy the mobile ringtones that feature DDR songs, but what may be kind of news to you is that they did show in the Games on the Go area at the Game Festival that they will be doing DDR on mobile phones.
5850446	5855229	This is probably just a port of what we've seen happen in Japan, because I believe they already have this in Japan.
5856409	5859371	Yeah, a couple, and they have like Max 300 I've seen.
5860251	5861592	Ooh, you got a bigger picture.
5863291	5864312	That looks interesting.
5865073	5866656	Okay, sorry, Jamie was showing me the potions.
5868098	5868959	So yeah, what can I say?
5868999	5872864	It's DDR on the cell phone, but funny enough, the screenshot I saw was Max 300.
5873685	5876068	And why you would want to play that on a cell phone, I have no idea.
5876890	5878452	Especially if there's no dance pad hookup.
5878792	5880373	That's like an exercise in futility.
5880673	5882995	Even if there was a dance pad hookup, that would be stupid.
5883715	5891081	The only use I would see for this is if you are a freestyler who needs your steps on the go.
5892682	5900527	Like if you're going to be in an upcoming tournament or something, you need to take a quick look at those steps before you go up on stage, like one more time, run through the routine in your mind.
5900947	5902969	That's where DDR on the cell phone would be a good idea.
5903289	5903949	The rest of this?
5904270	5904590	Crap.
5907304	5907785	But whatever.
5908806	5910747	I'll probably buy it anyway because I'm a consumer whore.
5911248	5911628	Honestly.
5914351	5916693	Jamie's showing me the bigger pictures of potion.
5917074	5917854	That looks very nice.
5919096	5919576	Looks pretty.
5919716	5920257	Pretty bottles.
5920897	5924361	I would rather buy a lot of Final Fantasy potion than DDR on the cell phone.
5924381	5924861	That's for sure.
5929526	5929746	Anywho.
5931601	5933221	Let's do tonight's cage match, shall we?
5933682	5936882	It's where we put three songs and battle against each other to the death.
5937723	5939483	And there are fatalities involved.
5940183	5941984	And one song emerges as the victor.
5942324	5946005	And you guys in chat have the final say on which one of these songs is the winner.
5946025	5948926	The winning song, by the way, goes in a rotation all week long.
5949326	5953027	All freaking week long on Orange Lounge Radio's Bomani and Video Game Music program.
5953387	5954007	Which is awesome.
5954947	5956468	So let's get it started, shall we?
5957088	5957408	Sure.
5960126	5965988	Last week in the Orange Lounge Radio Cage Match, an old friend band of Jamie's made it.
5966669	5968349	A friendly old band, a jolly old time.
5968650	5972151	Blur was the band, and the song was called Crazy Beat.
5972871	5975893	Is it crazy enough to win for a second week in a row?
5976553	5977373	I don't know, we'll see.
5979194	5984616	So we're going to play a clip for you guys, so you can judge if you liked us or not, and wanted to win for the second week in a row.
5985116	5988498	So here it is, song one in tonight's Cage Match, Blur with Crazy Beat.
5988618	5988878	Enjoy.
6001378	6004379	I love my brothers on Saturday night
6045459	6055068	I love my sister and I love her tonight Break out!
6085104	6088427	Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
6117113	6121576	Song numero uno in tonight's cage match, Blur with Crazy Beats.
6121596	6125439	You only get a clip of that, though, because if you wanted to hear the whole thing, you should have been listening last week.
6125759	6126580	Honestly, kids.
6127080	6130943	Alright, song number two in tonight's cage match comes to us via the Loki.
6131023	6133505	Loki, what did you pick for us tonight, sir?
6134926	6139149	Um, picked something from Alien 316, which is interesting.
6139749	6144413	Um, see, they should have been Alien 314, because then they could have been Alien Pie.
6145694	6146094	Ha ha ha.
6146798	6147198	I'm lame.
6147618	6147918	Shut up.
6148338	6157741	Anyways, um, yeah, so this is a song from Alien 316, which you might remember from Ultramix 1 with C-Square, or was it, wait, Ultramix 2.
6158581	6159141	I take that back.
6159321	6160222	By the way, it's Alien 613.
6160482	6161662	613, whatever.
6161682	6162162	313, whatever.
6162182	6164423	Who gives a crap?
6164823	6165743	Alien and some number.
6166303	6168624	Anyways, uh, this is the song All For Nothing.
6169924	6170204	Alright.
6171085	6174566	Alien number 613 with All For Nothing.
6174626	6175546	Enjoy song number 2.
6402773	6404634	DarkSakura, was that a number 10 or a number 2?
6404774	6407416	Um, it was more like a number 5.
6407616	6407756	Okay.
6407856	6408597	Just cause...
6426448	6456203	I mean, it was cool, but it didn't really do anything, just repeated the same little lick over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over
6456955	6457696	I don't know, whatever.
6458097	6462062	I really had nothing this week that I hadn't already picked.
6462443	6464987	You know, I thought that song was pretty good for me to poop on.
6465728	6466449	I'll give it a 4.
6468154	6470695	Alright, let's move on to song number three.
6470775	6472636	Song number three tonight is my pick.
6474537	6477739	And I also picked a former Bomani artist because I like this song.
6477799	6478619	It's pretty.
6479400	6482081	It's actually a song that she actually released in the U.S.
6482861	6483562	It's Tess.
6484382	6488064	And the song is called The Second You Sleep, I Stay to Watch You Fade Away.
6488524	6492326	And Tess, of course, did Justify My Love and all that stuff for DDR.
6492906	6496148	So here it is, Tess, here on Orange Lounge Radio, song number three.
6505267	6511683	by your side you close the door so
6650733	6664464	Hey, I say to watch you fade away, I dream of you tonight, tomorrow you're gone
6698680	6702052	I wish by God you'd say
6713669	6718953	Song number three in tonight's cage match, Tess, with The Second You Sleep by Stay to Watch You Fade Away.
6720574	6723936	Would you like to stay to watch that song, or would you like it to fade away?
6724697	6725017	Jamie?
6725818	6726438	Fade, please.
6726478	6727179	Generic Trance.
6727739	6731522	Although that one was not as annoying as the usual one, so it gives a seven.
6732142	6732503	All right.
6733623	6733884	Loki?
6734724	6736525	I'd like to know how you can watch music.
6738887	6739588	Shut up and rate it.
6741889	6742610	It gives a seven.
6744491	6746892	and I'll rate that too because everybody else is kind of in and out.
6747892	6749032	I will rate that song.
6749392	6751113	I like the melody in that song.
6751153	6758675	I think that's what sets it apart from other blah trance songs is I like the melody an awful lot in that song and the harmony and everything is great.
6758735	6760515	So I give that song a nine because I like it.
6761115	6761396	All right.
6762316	6766297	Let us recap, shall we, the three songs you can vote for tonight in tonight's cage match.
6766317	6770658	You can either vote for last week's winner, song number one, Blur with Crazy Beat.
6773771	6782557	Or you can vote for song number two, Alien number 613 with All For Nothing.
6792683	6798087	And song number three you can vote for tonight is The Second You Sleep by Stay To Watch You Fade Away by Tess.
6808459	6810739	Place vote now.
6810839	6816821	Send a private message to Sky in the chat room with your vote for song numero uno, dos, or tres.
6818041	6821302	And we will see which song emerges victorious.
6823762	6832284	This is the part of the show where I go over to Loki and I say, Hey, Loki, you know that Sim scene that's out there where people are playing Beatmania on their PSPs and shit?
6832644	6834104	What is going on in the Sim scene?
6834124	6836365	Because I could care less, but I know our listeners want to know.
6836465	6837305	So, Loki, what's up?
6838039	6850083	Um, just more stuff with DDR, um, OSC4, they are now in their In The Groove division, and they have the results for the keyboard, um, division of sim files out there.
6850303	6855945	I don't know what the difference would be with In The Groove sim files, I guess that's not quite impossible, but pretty impossible?
6856525	6856905	I don't know.
6858717	6870583	But anyways, if anyone cares, I will go into the results here of who won the keyboard section, which I don't even really, I haven't checked out any of the entries, so God knows.
6871524	6872384	Oh, and it doesn't exist.
6872444	6877747	Okay, anyways, in other... That's one of those Bomani-style bug things, like you can't log in on the forums or...
6878487	6879828	PoopTow, it's weird.
6879948	6881229	Anyways, who cares?
6881249	6883050	I have a secret account on Bobani Style.
6883090	6889134	I'm not actually Sky, because somehow I got locked out of that account, like I can't get in it or access it at all, so I have a secret name.
6889454	6889754	Secret.
6890194	6890655	Secret.
6891415	6898760	Anyways, on top of that, the other thing was all the sim files for Ultramix 3 have been released.
6900781	6901161	All of them.
6901381	6904303	Oh good, that means all the MP3s are out there, so people can stop whining for them.
6904628	6905549	Yes, they are.
6905949	6906309	I have them.
6907370	6908791	But no, they're up there.
6908811	6911112	You can find them at BomaniISO.com.
6911132	6912073	I think that's what it was.
6912213	6916736	Whatever that BitTorrent tracker was that has all the stuff that people steal and stuff.
6918778	6919078	Yay.
6922620	6922901	I don't know.
6924061	6925062	That's all that's going on, really.
6925702	6925963	Dead.
6926443	6926723	All right.
6926743	6927544	Nothing going on.
6927564	6928124	Well, it's Christmas.
6928184	6932207	Everybody's taking a break from the sim scene because they're bored.
6932567	6932747	What?
6932987	6933368	However...
6934676	6944521	We do have to, in a typical fashion, it is time to see how many really bad Max remixes have been released this week.
6946122	6949383	Anyways, so starting off.
6949603	6956727	And of course, if you guys were looking for those 2DX distorted clips, you can actually find them in their media shop.
6956747	6960128	They have four different videos on there, so you can check those out.
6961429	6961669	But,
6962366	6969888	If you really want to check out what everybody is looking for, and that's really horrible Max remixes, you can also check those out in their sim file form there.
6970788	6975269	And let's see, for this week, looks like it's been a pretty light week actually.
6975629	6984151	We've got Max Max, Max Stink, Max 340, Max Wizard, Max Attack.
6984991	6985291	Twice.
6985391	6986371	Max My Butt.
6988912	6989072	Yeah.
6990470	6991030	That would be it.
6992411	6993951	And Paranoia Fart Mix.
6996152	6996512	Not yet.
6996792	6998412	I didn't check and see how many Paranoia remixes there are.
6998432	7000193	I'm still waiting for the Safari Trans Mix.
7002133	7002894	Keep waiting.
7003454	7006215	You'll get your Safari Trans Mix before I'll get my Xbox 360.
7006255	7006475	Anyways.
7014612	7018153	I'd fill time, but I'm tallying cage match votes, so it's up to you guys.
7019573	7041262	And of course, you know, to cover the wonderful Paranoia remixes, we have Paranoia Survivor Another, Paranoia Trickmaster Edit, Paranoia Survivor Max 580, Paranoia Sky, Paranoia Agent Theme, that one I'm kind of interested to see what that is, Paranoia Eternal Freeze, Paranoia Zombie, Rotelda Paranoia,
7043410	7043650	Yeah.
7044952	7045153	Nice.
7045173	7047556	I don't know.
7047616	7047957	It's lame.
7049887	7057732	I want Max the final, and then I want Konami to threaten to sue anyone who puts out another Max remix, and so people can't do it anymore.
7059133	7060914	Because I just, I'm sick of Max remixes, I really am.
7060934	7062455	It's Maximizer now, don't you know?
7062755	7063176	Whatever.
7064236	7065077	Fuck Maximizer.
7065197	7067578	Maximizer wasn't even a freaking Max remix at all.
7067799	7073742	Fuck Maximizer, fuck Joni and Spesh Max, Super Max, Max My Ass, whatever that is.
7074423	7077525	Fuck Max, fuck Legend of Max, seriously.
7078247	7080608	They should make one called Extremer.
7081369	7082490	What was the middle one?
7082530	7084411	I don't even remember what the real ones are called anymore.
7084691	7087472	Max Unlimited.
7087532	7089133	Max Unlimited should have been where it stopped.
7089253	7090314	That should have been the last one.
7091134	7093796	Now, The Legend of Max was a good place to stop it.
7094076	7094796	Because that was cool.
7094836	7096798	It was kind of a song to wrap it up.
7096838	7100219	Paranoia, like Paranoia Respect, that was a good one to end it on.
7100420	7101260	That should be it.
7101440	7101820	They're done.
7103881	7104762	And same with B4U.
7104822	7108843	B4U was a good point to stop those remixes as well.
7108883	7117065	And what the fuck was that Max song that was in the Max Heart Attack one in Extreme Japan?
7117085	7117545	Max Period.
7118005	7119085	That was bullshit.
7119186	7120506	That was absolute bullshit.
7123267	7127048	Max Period makes me on my period.
7130669	7131009	Alright.
7133030	7143433	Anyway, we are going to go to a small break, and when we come back from this small break, we might do some more Skype calls, if you're good.
7144153	7148554	Otherwise, we're going to do the FUs of the week, so we'll see what kind of mood we're in when we come back from this.
7149214	7152955	But we will do both at some point, so don't get your panties in a bunch.
7154795	7161337	In this break, in celebration of Angel's new necklace, we're going to do a couple LED songs.
7163140	7167321	So we'll start it off with a little Love is Dreaminess, and we'll be back after this with more Orange Lounge!
7180065	7181225	DarkSakura
7193368	7194488	Thanks for watching!
7447276	7447897	Thanks for watching!
7479461	7480182	Thanks for watching!
7510620	7511237	Thank you for watching!
7534309	7535090	Thanks for watching!
7563861	7566373	So much for making the world a dream come true
7598032	7599073	Thanks for watching!
7655956	7662120	Gaming Radio, so uncensored that even Tom Brokaw could get a job with us.
7662140	7663320	Orange Lounge Radio.
7669767	7670807	Cracks me up every time.
7670867	7672568	See, it sounds like he says tax cunts.
7672848	7673188	Get it?
7675589	7676469	It totally does.
7677509	7678950	Welcome back to Orange Lawn Radio, boys and girls.
7679230	7680970	LED in that break.
7681030	7682350	Just nothing but LED.
7683251	7687052	Love is dreaminess, nebula grasper, something wonderful, photogenic.
7687832	7688432	All in that break.
7690808	7692371	I'm being a comedic genius in the chatroom.
7701050	7703671	And in fact, I don't know, I joined in a game here.
7703751	7707571	Somebody just asked, oh, I'm not even going to try to pronounce his name.
7707631	7708992	I'm totally going to butcher this.
7710332	7713252	Milfululi, Milfululi?
7713272	7714973	I probably fucked that up.
7715373	7717413	Says, what's black and white and red all over?
7717513	7719614	And everybody, you know, is putting their own answers.
7719654	7721234	I put a zebra that I just shot.
7722574	7724174	Rini said a nun in a blender.
7726055	7727135	Or a sunburnt penguin.
7728533	7731934	So everybody's a comedian these days, actually.
7732395	7732875	What's going on?
7733035	7734195	Yeah, I left the nun in a blender.
7734235	7735136	That's pretty good.
7737637	7737957	All right.
7738337	7739838	Michael Jackson.
7740778	7741018	What?
7741338	7744580	Because he has that red costume that he wears, and it's black and white around him.
7747181	7747921	You're hella dumb.
7749902	7750682	You said hella.
7751483	7751783	I did.
7751883	7753183	I'm from Northern California.
7753664	7754464	I have to say hella.
7756161	7760563	I guess I might as well acknowledge the fact that the one and only LankyStyle is sitting in the room with us right now.
7760603	7761704	How you doing, Mr. LankyStyle?
7762024	7762744	Why'd you do that?
7763045	7763265	Why?
7763305	7766386	Now this show's just taken a big turn for the worse.
7766406	7768908	Oh, this show took a turn for the worse two and a half years ago.
7769848	7774771	What, um, what's up?
7775231	7776071	That's when Loki joined.
7776532	7780253	I are funny.
7780293	7782054	What kind of games have you been playing this week, my friend?
7782895	7784836	Bring us back to talking about video games for a little bit.
7785256	7786838	Dragon Quest VIII
7800871	7813518	Because I love the, everybody knows I love the Dragon Quest series, but... That's funny, those are the exact same two games I've been playing, except a lot more Dragon Quest VIII, and when I have time, I'm actually like five hours into Dragon Quest VIII, and for me, that's a long time to be sitting with a game.
7813658	7813938	Exactly.
7813958	7814418	Seriously.
7814899	7820341	Even though it's only like probably... I'm probably like not even... About 4 or 5% of the game.
7820402	7822923	I haven't even scratched the surface of that game, I know I haven't.
7823343	7823923	And that's fine.
7824524	7825504	At least I'm getting my money's worth.
7825824	7830267	But I know that I will probably completely ignore Dragon Quest this week when Animal Crossing comes out.
7830367	7830927	That's true.
7831428	7832108	Animal Crossing.
7832668	7834229	That is looking pretty good.
7834369	7838792	I mean, I haven't been doing a lot of reading on the features, but I mean... Who gives a shit?
7838832	7840613	I know it has the online... Who gives a shit?
7840653	7842614	It's online, it's Animal Crossing, and I get a bug net.
7843894	7848677	But I'm wondering if it's going to be fresh enough to keep me into it longer than I was the original.
7849818	7851919	Everybody else stayed on it for... Internet, me, me...
7852833	7853913	Man, that's true.
7855494	7856434	You know, that would be great.
7856514	7866698	I think in Animal Crossing, there should be a day called I Kill Every One Day, and I go and I shoot the people I don't like in the village and then cook them for dinner.
7868559	7871400	That would be the greatest Animal Crossing day ever.
7871700	7876122	You get the, like, come here, Olivia, razor-wired bug net.
7877182	7878443	You get to hit them over the head with.
7879975	7885280	It's Battle Royale Day on Animal Crossing.
7885380	7886661	I told my foo-poo joke.
7887101	7888763	What's this, dare I ask?
7888983	7889704	Okay, I'll repeat it.
7890344	7893727	How dare you interrupt my Animal Crossing rant, by the way.
7893807	7896069	You will be in the Animal Battle Royale.
7897310	7899772	My Animal Crossing has been pre-ordered already.
7900573	7901374	Alright, what's the joke?
7901654	7903916	Okay, I'm going to have to retell it.
7905376	7908618	These explorers, there's a legend of a bird called the Foo Poo Bird.
7908938	7909998	I've told you this one before.
7910839	7911259	I think so.
7911879	7915761	Anyway, the legend is that anyone who goes after the Foo Poo Bird disappears.
7916441	7918162	So three explorers decide they're going to find it.
7918342	7920003	One goes one way and two go off the other way.
7920803	7928827	And so the one who's by himself, he hears this, and then he finds he's got poo on his head, so he wipes it off.
7929367	7930128	And he vanishes.
7931228	7934310	So the other two are together, and all of a sudden they hear, Roar!
7935856	7938158	and one of them looks up in time to get shot on in the face.
7938798	7939559	So he wipes it off.
7939579	7940139	That's no fun.
7940339	7941160	And he disappears.
7941940	7943101	And the other one's like, oh no!
7943341	7945483	And he starts running off because he saw how it happened.
7946164	7950306	And so right before he gets to the end of the jungle, and he's got poo on his head.
7950327	7951607	He's like, well, crap.
7951708	7953549	I know if I wipe this off, I'm going to disappear.
7954029	7955230	So he goes home with shit on his head.
7956171	7959433	And he goes home to his wife and she goes, why do you have crap on your head?
7959773	7963136	He's like, because if you wipe off the poop of the foo-poo bird, then you'll disappear.
7963716	7964957	Okay, well, we'll live with it.
7965017	7965637	So they go to bed.
7965997	7968698	But the stink is so bad that she has to wipe it off of his head.
7969118	7970899	So when she does, it disappears.
7970919	7972520	So you know what the moral of the story is?
7973740	7974020	What?
7974341	7975281	If the fooshits wear it.
7983865	7984805	Please don't quit your day job.
7986646	7987226	I wish I could.
7990149	7991670	Oh my god, that was so bad!
7991710	7992831	It was so bad!
7993412	7994413	So very bad!
7994713	7996214	It was bad, bad, bad!
7996274	7999197	Wow, this brings me back to World's Worst Forward.
7999977	8005702	That makes me want to go watch Deuce Bigelow, European Gigolo, just so I can hear something funny.
8006082	8006403	Maybe.
8012207	8013488	Now that the show has been ruined.
8013709	8014009	Thank you.
8015556	8016257	You laughed.
8016277	8018498	Get the fooshits, Jesus Christ.
8019159	8020179	All right.
8020820	8023942	That is definitely an opportunity for us to go into the FUs of the week.
8024342	8026064	Hey, I told the one-eyed whore joke, too.
8027525	8028425	The one-eyed whore joke?
8028866	8029246	Yeah.
8029266	8029586	You know what?
8029626	8032308	I'm not even going to ask.
8033229	8035571	I'm simply going to go to the FUs of the week.
8035611	8038332	And, Jamie, why is it that we do these FUs of the week every single week?
8053236	8056901	The first Seth U of the week goes to Rob for not finding my joke hilarious.
8057482	8058864	Which it was, and you know it.
8060273	8066699	The second SU of the week goes toward certain aspects of my employment, which I am not at liberty to discuss.
8069621	8076167	Another aspect goes toward me for not having the money that I want to have right now.
8077008	8078149	And traffic.
8078449	8079831	I hate traffic in this area.
8080872	8085456	And also a humongous SU goes to superficiality.
8086477	8086857	And that's it.
8088846	8091448	Alright, that was, yeah I was going to say that was short.
8091508	8094710	And having the plague, because I feel it coming upon me again.
8095270	8095770	Oh god.
8097511	8101534	Alright, let's go over to Loki.
8102755	8103075	Okay.
8106317	8113581	Anyways, to start off my FUs of the week, I'm actually kind of, this is not anything that has to do with me.
8114042	8117904	My sister's house was actually broken into by some guy in broad daylight.
8118243	8121105	Now this is how retarded this guy is, and this is kind of funny.
8121865	8124166	The guy was breaking into the house in broad daylight.
8124366	8126648	People observed him breaking into the house.
8126768	8130010	First he tried the garage door and couldn't pry it open with his crowbar.
8130430	8133371	Tried the front door, couldn't pry it open with his crowbar.
8133712	8136333	Tried kicking in the front door, still couldn't get it.
8136713	8138654	Tried the side door, couldn't get that.
8139015	8141236	And if the fool shits, wear it.
8142847	8149651	Finally, he tried breaking the bedroom window, got in through there and stole some costume jewelry and then left.
8151652	8153774	Thereby netting absolutely nothing.
8156135	8158136	So, fuck you, the stupid, retarded people.
8158236	8165861	Not only that, he stopped traffic as he was running across the street to escape being caught, even though he was already seen.
8166417	8169518	But he did get away because the cops took an hour to respond.
8169658	8171839	Thank you, Carmichael PD.
8173360	8186065	Anyways, um, then, um, fuck you to Microsoft for fucking up both, not only the US launch of the 360, but now the UK launch, and I know you're gonna go for 3.
8187405	8196628	with the Japanese launch, but too bad the Japanese don't give a shit about your system because all the wonderful games are coming out for it, like the wonderful RPGs and DOA4 and stuff.
8196708	8198908	Oh yeah, those aren't coming out at launch because they're delayed now.
8198988	8199889	Thank you very much.
8200369	8203970	But hey, they can play Madden because Madden rocks, I guess.
8205930	8212652	Also, fuck you to GameStop for not getting any more shipments in of the 360.
8213052	8215133	I know it's not their fault, but still though,
8215598	8217059	They said I was halfway down the list.
8217119	8217860	They lied to me.
8217880	8219482	I was actually towards the bottom of the list.
8219522	8222745	So fuck them for not knowing what halfway means.
8223485	8227409	And also, fuck you to stupid people driving your cars because you can't.
8227949	8232433	And women do not need to be driving SUVs because they're obviously too big for them to handle.
8236097	8236417	Wow.
8237017	8237758	Yeah, fuck them.
8239139	8240180	Stupid useless vehicle.
8241782	8242042	They could...
8242421	8248766	They could save that Japanese Xbox 360 launch if they would just make an Arnold Schwarzenegger game.
8249487	8251749	I mean, they love Arnold Schwarzenegger in Japan.
8255372	8256133	Go play my game!
8258395	8259055	Do it now!
8261578	8262578	Govenator!
8265181	8265921	Alright, I'm done.
8267603	8270105	Okay, I guess that means it's now my turn.
8274726	8282149	Um, I would say an F you just to the fact that I've just been feeling like shit all week and I've just been doing some crazy things.
8282809	8290491	And the fact that I've just had lack of sleep and just been overall just feeling rather blah and I don't know.
8291092	8294813	F you to the fact that I'm just an angsty person and...
8296843	8300627	This F you to the fact that it's Christmas time and this time of year always sucks.
8301128	8301789	It just does.
8302029	8308956	I hope Santa... I better not say that because the FBI will come after us and say, I hope Santa brings me a bomb for Christmas so I can blow some people up.
8310158	8311760	But I'm not really meaning that.
8311860	8312340	I don't mean that.
8312661	8314202	Now, now, you don't have the turban for that.
8315163	8316024	That is horrible.
8316265	8316925	That is horrible.
8318107	8318427	All right.
8319867	8324249	Not really, I hope it's a bomb full of confetti, so I can show you my love.
8324429	8328391	Full of wonderful radioactive confetti.
8330331	8331592	I'm on some list now.
8331612	8337474	You can always do what the major retailers are doing, that's just crash a float into somebody.
8338635	8339655	Yeah, that sounds like fun.
8340596	8344117	I want somebody to build me a Spongebob bomb of air.
8344557	8344938	Hot air.
8344958	8345878	That'd be fun.
8347287	8349428	I think there's already enough hot air in the government.
8349748	8350108	Alright.
8350869	8353290	Alright, let's go to Brad.
8353330	8356131	I'm sure Brad has some FUs that he wants to get out of his system.
8356231	8357051	Sure, why not.
8357111	8358552	What do you call a deer with no eyes?
8359432	8360053	No eye-deer.
8360733	8362534	What do you call a deer with no eyes and no legs?
8362974	8363794	Still no eye-deer.
8365135	8367456	There's my FUs of the week.
8367936	8370998	Well, if we were going with corny jokes for the night, then I figured, you know.
8371218	8372999	You are fucking lame.
8373979	8375219	Angel, don't run away.
8375460	8376220	What's your FUs of the week?
8377507	8385173	Um, yeah, a few people that didn't say happy birthday, but you guys did, so you guys love me, yay!
8386114	8386575	Yay!
8388296	8390358	Um, I don't know, what else?
8390578	8392179	Oh yeah, it's been hella cold, what the hell?
8392760	8399865	I can't really say that though, because people in other areas of the United States are colder, so whatever.
8401006	8403348	Well, I've been cold, so you know what, yeah, whatever.
8405070	8405891	Uh, who didn't go?
8407172	8407552	Anyone?
8407973	8409414	Okay, I'm just talking to myself.
8409735	8410015	Bye.
8411376	8412398	Okay.
8413359	8415341	Rise Princess, do you have anything you want to get out of your system?
8415501	8416682	I see you kind of lurking over there.
8417343	8418724	Any FUs of the week that you have?
8421347	8423609	Well, I tried saying it into a microphone so that our listeners can hear.
8423910	8424490	Yummy brownies?
8424510	8425251	There's yummy brownies?
8426112	8426933	Where's the yummy brownies?
8429090	8430432	Let's get to the chatroom FUs, shall we?
8430452	8430712	Let's go.
8453862	8461564	Dark Knight would like to say F you to early morning shifts during the holidays and an F you to people I work with for they are so stupid.
8463165	8465206	And they're supposed to be salesmen for the love of Mike.
8467485	8471849	Sakurina says, F you to Konami of Hawaii, you whores, for removing the fuck from Guideka.
8472229	8475692	How dare you, it sounds like shit now that you shitheads get the fuck out of my life.
8476352	8478374	F you to lame puns, since that's all I do.
8478994	8482937	And yeah, F you to my mom for switching from OSX to Windows, what the fuck is wrong with you?
8483257	8485960	And F you to Loki for saying women can't drive SUVs.
8488642	8491144	Truth hurts, right?
8491744	8493866	Not as much as a woman hitting you with her SUV.
8495441	8503403	If you read the article that I posted on the site, you would see that I said the exact same thing.
8517128	8519209	But they're saying that it's coming back in March.
8519550	8522632	Yes, well that means it's discontinued until March.
8522652	8523132	Duh.
8523332	8524113	Touché.
8524733	8527055	Tomokun would also like to say, fuck Xbox 360.
8527415	8527775	Well said.
8528876	8531698	NintendoManiac64 says, F you to my DS's L button.
8531738	8534460	I can't play some of my GBA games on my DS efficiently now.
8535320	8538302	F you to Mario Kart DS disconnectors that disconnect at the end of races.
8539643	8542624	F you to my parents who don't really trust ordering things online at all.
8543444	8547305	Now how else am I supposed to use this PlayStation DDR pad when I don't even have a PS2?
8547645	8549786	Besides, Step Mania isn't that fun without a pad.
8551967	8556548	ProPanda21 says, F you to bras that break and stab you with their wires of evil.
8557468	8559009	And to really bad foo-poo jokes.
8561398	8565320	Sephiroth1215 says, F you to Dead or Alive 4 being pushed back another two weeks.
8566400	8567061	Well, what do you expect?
8567101	8567641	It's F box.
8568601	8576044	Um... F you to the shitty name MPQ and not being able to think of anything better, so I have to use Mil-Fu-Lu-Li.
8576625	8577045	There you go.
8577645	8579746	F you to go into the arcade and not getting to play 2DX.
8581947	8584228	DarkTetsuya says, one last F you to AOL.
8584548	8586068	Can't say I'll miss any of the following.
8586329	8589550	The random disconnects, the out of memory errors, and the constant lockups.
8591632	8592993	I have actually one more.
8593353	8593593	Okay.
8594114	8597376	And F you to Xbox 360 for freezing.
8598277	8601359	You know they say only 3% of Xbox 360s is supposed to be doing that.
8601619	8602039	You're lucky.
8602300	8602800	You're a liar.
8602900	8603420	You're a winner.
8605082	8610366	Message to Zaku says, F you to getting up this morning to go to the supermarket only to leave without buying something.
8611106	8617411	F you to finals starting this week and F you to having to hold off buying my new hard drive until after the holidays because of my tight financial situation.

8641863	8643603	People are like, la la la, pulling in.
8643703	8645163	Oh shit, there's only one lane now.
8645983	8649464	Also, F you to the Java IRC chat because it made me late getting to the chat.
8651681	8658342	Neo Dude says, F you to Nintendo Wi-Fi connection because I can't connect to a WPA protected network with a DS.
8658823	8660503	Now I have to buy the USB connector for $35.
8660843	8668345	Big Power says, F you to the yearly December break that many TV shows go on when they have a long break with no new episodes.
8668725	8670385	I want my Lost and Prison break.
8670525	8672265	Oh, and watch 24 when it comes back on.
8673806	8677867	Goggle says, F the whole college application process.
8678787	8679447	And F back pain.
8682622	8689326	GS-191 says F you to my workplace for playing that damn Rent song over and over and over again last week.
8689706	8691868	At least they were playing Daft Punk's Technologic.
8692668	8696010	Now we're playing sucky Christmas music now with crappy pop remixes.
8696070	8702654	A late F you to Black Friday and stupid customers ask me where are the iPods, GPS, random shit when I'm in the fucking printer aisle.
8702694	8704355	Do you see any fucking iPods here?
8704395	8705756	Look at the fucking map we gave you.
8707403	8710025	Xander C says, F you to Jamie's lame jokes.
8711666	8712727	You need to trout slap him.
8713167	8713648	You know what?
8713808	8714048	What?
8714769	8715089	Slap.
8715109	8715489	There you go.
8716130	8718191	F you to Sky not picking up my Skype call.
8718231	8720533	Hey, buddy, I pick them up as they're coming in.
8721253	8723575	F you to the weather here in Florida not being cold yet.
8723996	8725236	F you to having back problems.
8725397	8726678	F you to bunches of stuff.
8727959	8729159	I hate that bunches of stuff.
8730460	8734101	Bronchan says, F you to me for still being unemployed and still looking for a job.
8734161	8735481	Damn, I needs me some cash.
8735921	8738762	By the way, F you to people who haven't paid me for fixing their computers.
8738842	8740483	I will upload a virus to your machine.
8742443	8746184	And lastly, Spiritsnare would like to say an F you to Xbox 360.
8746964	8750225	F you to Rent because it has some of the most addicting songs I've ever heard on their soundtrack.
8750665	8755546	F you to Final Fantasy Potions because they probably will never make it over here except at anime conventions.
8757107	8757987	Also an F you to...
8760985	8764826	at $30 and not $20, even though they're not decent ports.
8767607	8769327	Damn, you bitches are angsty tonight.
8769368	8770268	That's all I have to say.
8770368	8770708	Wow.
8771328	8772048	Wow, wow, wow.
8772148	8773869	The chat room has turned into bra chat.
8774289	8774669	Oh, really?
8775029	8777530	And what kind of things have we learned about bras?
8778570	8781591	Apparently underwear keeps you from being droopy like grandma when you're old.
8782411	8787052	You know, I'm glad that my underwear does not have metal wires in it because that might be painful.
8787432	8788433	Worst invention ever.
8789833	8795297	You know, but I do recall from, you know, I used to date girls and sometimes we'd get, you know, we'd get... Shut up!
8795677	8796998	Why is everybody laughing at that?
8797838	8805263	You know, we used to sometimes get a little freaky and I used to... Going shopping with a girl and your girlfriend doesn't mean you're dating them.
8805283	8805703	No, no, no.
8805863	8810907	I actually, I used to take girls' bras off and I remember it was a pain in the ass to do.
8810987	8814389	Like, it's... You need... That was the sign right there.
8814749	8815410	Seriously!
8815510	8816670	That's how I knew I was gay.
8816710	8817911	I was like, fuck this bra shit.
8817931	8818952	I'm just gonna suck dick.
8821095	8824236	It's not that hard.
8824476	8826777	It's not that hard when you figure it out.
8827258	8828858	It's not that hard when you figure it out.
8830419	8830899	Seriously.
8831279	8831719	I know.
8832120	8832780	I just, you know.
8832800	8836561	You can get to the point where you can just look at a broad and it pops up.
8836581	8837402	Look, I give up easy.
8837602	8838422	I give up easy, okay?
8838462	8838942	I'm a quitter.
8839783	8840863	I take the lazy way out.
8844045	8844385	Alright.
8845945	8846266	What?
8846346	8847106	What's so damn funny?
8848408	8850810	Rob is more interested in putting them on than taking them off.
8852371	8853132	No way.
8853252	8854834	Take that both ways if you want.
8854974	8857376	No, that is the gay stereotype I do not do, okay?
8860453	8864496	Every gay person I know fits into some gay stereotype.
8864536	8866637	There's some gay stereotype.
8866737	8867378	Even Shane.
8867698	8867918	What?
8868358	8878085	What was that one time at the other apartment when I came back from the pool and there was people wearing bras with water balloon or condom breasts?
8878125	8878445	Not me.
8878725	8880266	That was my surprise birthday party.
8880366	8882008	There was a dress involved.
8883028	8884549	I didn't wear a bra.
8884589	8888192	It was a bitch and hoe party and that was the whole theme.
8891037	8893659	I'm just hoping you wasn't getting, like, hot and bothered off of it, that's all.
8894039	8895621	No, you weren't wearing a bra.
8895701	8896681	No, I wasn't.
8896862	8898503	Hell no, I was the pimp of the party.
8898523	8899844	Everybody else was the bitch and hoe.
8900004	8900304	I see.
8902966	8908650	I can't understand how you can, like, teach, you know, PPOs and HMOs and all that complicated crap.
8908670	8910191	Don't talk about it!
8910211	8913474	You can't unhook three little hooks from a bra.
8913494	8914274	No, like, seriously?
8914314	8916276	If the girls I used to date would have, like, the 20-hook bra?
8917679	8920020	The 20 hook bras.
8920100	8921881	Were they grandmas or something?
8922001	8923021	Like you liked older women?
8923041	8923422	I don't know.
8923462	8924442	Dating gorillas?
8924802	8925282	No!
8926003	8928664	I was dating very nice women that had bras with 20 hooks on them.
8928684	8932445	I don't know, in some respects that might not be a bad thing since that involves Damon Auburn.
8933085	8933726	Oh, stop it.
8934406	8937667	So 20 hooks, were they monkey people or something?
8937727	8939988	No, it was a complicated bra.
8942546	8951630	I would like you to meet my wonderful friend... They need to make bra... You know what?
8952010	8954331	Why don't they make... Here's a novel concept.
8954571	8955632	Why don't they make what?
8956232	8957152	No, no, let me finish.
8957552	8959713	Why don't they make a bra out of Velcro?
8960434	8961354	Wouldn't that be easy?
8961754	8963595	Just rip, and there we go.
8964015	8965596	Because Velcro doesn't hold for shit.
8966678	8968619	No, then, you know what?
8968900	8972442	I know some girls on the Itty Bitty Titty Committee who they would work just fine for.
8972462	8975304	But that's the whole point.
8976305	8988314	I'm sorry, the fact that you wouldn't mind pulling the bra off of an Itty Bitty Titty Committee applicant shows that you're gay, but whatever.
8988354	8989855	DarkSakura, you had a comment?
8989955	8991696	I completely forgot what I was going to say.
8991716	8994939	Oh, I know, well, you shouldn't have dated girls who were girdles.
8996470	9003138	I don't know.
9003759	9009246	Maybe in my mind, maybe they weren't really 20 hooks, but in my mind, I've gone back.
9009286	9012249	Yeah, I'm having nightmares of the bras.
9012770	9015213	I remember looking at the back and it's like these big teeth.
9017602	9019303	Don't you dare touch me!
9019523	9021965	Rob has braphobia.
9022245	9022445	What?
9022625	9023546	Rob has braphobia.
9026527	9028728	He has those dreams where it's really abstract.
9028768	9032630	He looks at it and the hooks go down towards the horizon.
9033511	9035772	Never ending bra strap.
9036833	9037813	That's like my hell.
9038694	9040995	It's like, here, do you want to get into the gates of heaven?
9041335	9044297	Just unhook the door that's very similar to a bra.
9044837	9044937	Oh!
9045197	9048078	And then you have sex with women and oh man, that's crazy hell.
9070154	9071035	Yeah, anyway, yeah, yeah.
9071095	9074198	I don't like all this talk about me and my bra thing.
9074258	9075279	I'm just writing my movie.
9075479	9075819	That's all.
9076060	9076880	Oh, your movie?
9076900	9077501	What's your movie?
9077681	9078942	Do you want to plug your movie?
9078962	9079903	The Life of Rob.
9079983	9082526	That's what people do on shows is they plug things.
9082546	9084147	So you have a movie coming out you want to promote?
9084167	9084488	No, I don't.
9084588	9084988	No, you don't?
9085088	9085509	Not yet.
9086229	9086970	Are you writing one?
9086990	9087330	Maybe someday.
9087350	9088131	Do you want to pitch one?
9088271	9088491	No.
9088652	9090413	We have important people listening to this program.
9090433	9090714	Yeah.
9091915	9092435	Like my mother.
9096519	9099882	Sorry, that was something that listeners couldn't see, but whatever.
9100262	9100723	Bad radio.
9100983	9101363	That was funny.
9102605	9103045	Good times.
9105927	9109190	And of course now our chat room just suddenly fills up with all this chat.
9109210	9110792	Bra, bra, bra, bra, bra, bra, bra, bra, bra.
9110932	9113434	Not Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, but bra, bra, bra, bra, bra.
9113594	9116837	But we were talking about bras before we got on the verbal topic.
9116997	9117258	I know.
9118259	9118479	I know.
9118639	9119079	Okay, anyways.
9119360	9119540	What?
9119760	9120360	Oh yes, Loki.
9120721	9121922	Something related to video gaming.
9122739	9123700	No, I didn't have anything.
9123740	9127122	I was just going to say, very rare bear.
9128663	9129343	Love the inside joke.
9129463	9130003	I need a break.
9132125	9133325	At least it's not cake pie.
9133445	9135166	We're going to do a break, and then we're going to come back.
9136047	9137848	We're going to come back, and we're going to do some Skype.
9139389	9141290	Skype at you, coming at you.
9142190	9146173	And then Ask Orange Lounge, because we know you want to ask us some questions.
9146493	9148794	And therefore, we want to give you some answers.
9149895	9150735	Does that sound like a plan?
9150756	9150836	Yeah.
9151756	9153958	I'm like, Jesus, I hope you're with my heart
9204915	9206078	Thank you for watching!
9236092	9237013	Thank you for watching!
9365153	9366234	Thanks for watching!
9528914	9530215	Thank you for watching!
9562899	9566760	Orange Lounge Radio, Mamani Music, and more
9592487	9593148	R2-D2 Princess Leia
9616784	9617605	That is so cool.
9617625	9618385	Like when I push it.
9618686	9619506	Oh, bun-headed.
9619606	9620387	Show it on the wall.
9620987	9622829	It's Princess Leia with a bun.
9622889	9623849	That is so badass.
9624370	9625411	And then I have lots of drugs.
9625431	9625971	I want one.
9626211	9627792	And I have like the most awesome keychain.
9628633	9629714	Uh, cell phone strap.
9630214	9630915	What is that now?
9631075	9631935	I have Prince.
9633196	9634257	From Katamari Damashii.
9634657	9635878	No, no, no, no, no.
9635938	9638100	Now you just need the ringtones and then you'd be a total addict there.
9638120	9639181	Oh, I can get those or midis.
9639401	9639621	Alright.
9640642	9641603	Let's go to a call.
9641643	9642803	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
9642823	9643164	Who dis?
9644611	9645752	It's the one and only Ron Chan.
9645772	9646432	What's up, fellas?
9646512	9647212	Hello, Ron Chan.
9647232	9647633	How are you?
9648833	9649534	I'm doing good.
9649554	9649954	I'm doing good.
9649994	9652395	I just want to point out, though, DarkSakura is not a fella.
9654757	9655577	I know, I know.
9655657	9657198	I have that effect on women.
9657318	9658399	I'm sorry.
9658559	9659359	That's alright.
9660200	9661981	I've seen you hanging with the ladies, Ron.
9662081	9662481	Not really.
9662541	9663742	Just a couple.
9664222	9665943	But, no, I don't know where I'm going with that.
9665983	9670325	Anyway... I don't think it would be possible to mistake me for a dude since I have humongous boobs.
9671046	9672807	Does your bra have 20 hooks on it?
9672947	9673147	That's...
9674341	9675323	No, Rob, just three.
9675764	9676044	Okay.
9677387	9678188	What about Velcro?
9678208	9679330	What do you think of... Never mind, forget it.
9680332	9681274	Rob, what's on your mind?
9681294	9683418	Nothing much.
9683458	9685502	I'm still addicted to Mario Kart DS.
9687239	9687999	It is a fun game.
9688020	9690541	Do you actually find friends online to play against?
9690561	9693022	Because I never do, unless I set it up on Instant Messenger.
9694103	9694984	That's the only way.
9695124	9697845	If I'm in a chat room with a bunch of us, that's how we do it.
9697865	9700047	And even half the time, we can't even race each other.
9701007	9701347	Wow.
9701507	9704109	Oh, because you don't find each other on the game or something?
9704149	9704449	Or what?
9705390	9706350	We don't find each other.
9706530	9708552	One time it was like five of us.
9708572	9710653	We were going to try to get at least four of us in a race.
9711073	9712554	It turned out to be me and two people.
9713134	9713975	Or me and one person.
9714575	9715175	That's weird.
9715215	9718257	So it can't find your friends or something?
9718977	9720797	Maybe the lag was too great or something.
9722138	9722698	What lag?
9722738	9725819	I mean, I do this at work and the router's like six feet behind me.
9726940	9727820	I don't know what to tell you, buddy.
9727940	9728380	I'm sorry.
9729821	9731822	I'm not too worried about it, but I can say this.
9732242	9737584	With my DS, I found plenty of wireless networks around my neighborhood.
9739958	9748163	I was at Rice Princess and Lanky Styles' apartment not that long ago, and I tapped into a wireless network near them, and that made me feel like an elite hacker.
9748203	9748663	It was cool.
9749624	9750764	I was stealing bandwidth.
9750804	9751485	I could go to jail.
9753526	9754847	Hey, I call it sharing the wealth.
9755347	9756868	Are you going to be getting Animal Crossing?
9758584	9759485	Maybe in a couple of weeks.
9759625	9759945	All right.
9760185	9763687	Well, when you get it, you, me, bike racks, 3 o'clock, bring your bug net.
9764248	9764648	It's on.
9766149	9766609	Bring it.
9767009	9767370	Bring it.
9767410	9768851	It's already been brought in, my friend.
9770652	9770912	All right.
9771192	9771612	Oh, yeah.
9771793	9774314	One thing from last week, you were talking about Captain Con.
9774754	9774995	Yes.
9775055	9778277	I went to Captain Con and we got snowed in for two days.
9779354	9784117	If I get snowed in at this crazy convention in D.C., which I will be going to, it sounds like.
9784497	9785798	I have the time approved off work.
9785858	9788339	All I have to do is get a plane ticket, which are very affordable right now.
9788859	9790160	So I'm going to be booking that sometime this week.
9791360	9793962	I just need to discuss travel arrangements with you, my friend.
9795362	9795943	Sure, no problem.
9795983	9797544	If I get snowed in, I'm going to cry.
9797964	9798924	I am from California.
9798984	9800465	I've lived in California my entire life.
9800685	9801686	I don't do snow.
9802666	9803307	Do you know this?
9803708	9806671	I have never, this is going to be a crazy concept to some of you people.
9807432	9811517	I have never seen snow falling from the sky in person.
9811777	9811997	Never.
9812077	9813439	I have and that was in Alabama.
9814981	9815301	Never.
9815461	9817123	I've never seen snow falling from the sky.
9817143	9819186	That was like way down south in Alabama.
9819246	9820027	That was in Mobile.
9821303	9822143	I've seen snow once.
9822203	9823063	It's already on the ground.
9823123	9825964	It's not that hard to drive up to Reno and see some snow here where we live.
9826164	9829365	But I've never seen snow fall from the sky.
9829465	9840668	Every time it's happened in Sacramento, like the two times this ever happens since I've been alive, I was either asleep or the one other time it ever happened, I was doing an internet radio show, believe it or not, at the old college station.
9841548	9841988	Crazy, huh?
9843128	9844229	We're going to have to get a wee now.
9844369	9845769	All right.
9845809	9847770	Well, it better not snow because I don't know what to do.
9847790	9849510	I will cry like a little girl.
9850990	9854911	No, what'll happen is they'll shut down the airport and get out a day later.
9855071	9858232	Oh my god, I will poop myself if that happens.
9858272	9859232	I don't know how to deal with that.
9859372	9860752	I don't do flight delays.
9862212	9862473	Alright.
9862513	9866093	That happened to a bunch of West Coast guys that came to CapsuleCon 9 two years ago.
9866113	9867254	Stop scaring me!
9867274	9869514	Alright, we gotta go.
9869534	9870114	We gotta take more calls.
9870134	9870914	You'll be there, friend.
9870954	9871935	It's not that bad.
9872075	9873155	We gotta take more calls.
9873615	9874535	And you're freaking me out.
9874555	9875875	I'm gonna have nightmares tonight about snow.
9875975	9876256	Alright.
9877436	9878016	Take care, my friend.
9879349	9880290	Thank you for watching!
9909887	9910407	Oh, there he is.
9910448	9910968	He's back now.
9911408	9912729	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
9914971	9916572	Hello, you are on Orange Lounge Radio.
9917873	9918194	Hello.
9918734	9919054	Hello.
9919835	9921536	Bienvenidos a Orange Lounge Radio.
9922577	9923098	What's on your mind?
9925373	9926253	What is on your mind, my friend?
9927593	9929574	Um, dang.
9930794	9932355	First off, who the hell is this?
9932575	9933015	Who is this?
9933235	9934675	Finally, we have the end of the show.
9935175	9935815	Xander from Florida.
9936555	9937456	Oh, hi, Xander from Florida.
9937476	9937936	What's on your mind?
9939456	9946318	Um, I don't know if this is the right show to do, but I wanted to bring up the Nintendo Revolution not supporting HDTV thingy real quick.
9947018	9947418	Uh, sure.
9947658	9947958	What's up?
9949815	9962288	Well, um, basically I think the reason they're doing it is, um, well for one reason, because they're using standard DVDs, I think it's not really smart to be, uh, doing HD.
9962909	9971598	Because, I mean, you're seeing with the, uh, Xbox 360 with, um, Oblivion, or, yeah, Oblivion, it's like gonna take up four discs or something like that.
9973226	9975147	That's one thing, another thing is the cost.
9975308	9979831	I mean, it's just going to be a ridiculous cost to small developers to try to put HD in their games.
9980764	9982125	I somewhat agree with you.
9982286	9989672	I also think the reason why they're not doing it is because Loki has me convinced that the revolution is the fact that there is going to be stereoscopic 3D.
9990032	9991773	And they just don't want to do that for HDTV.
9991813	9992594	That would cost too much.
9992934	9995496	I heard you say that too.
9995577	9997058	I don't know if they're going to do that.
9997398	9998179	I don't know.
9998339	9999400	I think that would cost too much.
10000160	10000521	I don't know.
10000641	10003623	I don't think it would fit in their $200 price range thingy.
10003843	10008527	If they have a good development kit, all you need is 3D World Runner all over again.
10008647	10009268	Rad Racer.
10012370	10015513	Can somebody explain to me what the fuck the point was of 3D and Rad Racer?
10015593	10017114	It did like nothing for that game.
10017394	10018895	3D and Rad Racer did nothing.
10019596	10020737	It was so rad.
10021237	10021557	Shut up.
10023459	10024059	You know what?
10024139	10025200	You bring up some good points.
10025260	10029063	And I, owning an HDTV, it makes me sad that Nintendo is not supporting it.
10029143	10032246	However, if they're doing it for cost reasons...
10032646	10043097	and if they're doing it for these other reasons that they plan to do more crazy shit with their system, I'm okay with it, but remember the golden rule, a system is only a good game.
10043778	10045059	Wow, we've got the whole internet saying that.
10045099	10050405	Here's the other thing also, just because they say they're not supporting HD does not mean that the
10050885	10057848	It just means they're not supporting the formats of HD, you know, the aspect ratios and stuff, so it could be something completely different also.
10057968	10060849	Maybe they'll still support progressive scan and widescreen.
10061069	10061950	That would be okay.
10062030	10065131	Maybe they'll support 480, what would that be, 480p.
10065151	10065671	480, yeah.
10065691	10066312	That's okay.
10066532	10068293	There's some pretty good looking games at 480p.
10069413	10070073	Maybe you're right.
10070133	10074395	Maybe the fact that they're not doing HDTV means they're not going to support 1080p or something.
10074795	10075336	That's okay.
10075476	10078457	As long as my games can have some widescreen in it and some progressive...
10078917	10079177	Damn it.
10079458	10080919	Some progressive scan, some widescreen.
10081099	10083882	That would be kind of cool, but I'm not going to hold my breath with Nintendo here.
10084643	10084863	Yeah.
10085764	10091629	Well, they're supposed to announce more... Did you hear that they have another big secret, apparently?
10092690	10093391	Well, yeah.
10093431	10094893	Yeah, that it's stereoscopic 3D.
10094953	10100017	No, they're saying... They're saying... There's... Mario Mato did another speech...
10101182	10104164	Oh, yeah, yeah, I heard, I read somewhere that Miyamoto did another speech.
10104564	10107906	Yeah, just to add to your argument, somebody posted this on LJ and I saw this.
10108306	10114770	Miyamoto did another speech and said there's a, there's another secret coming that you kids don't know about, so just you wait for it.
10115011	10119173	Everyone thinks it's about the controller because he was talking about the controller at the time, but I don't think it is.
10119253	10121474	I think it's, it's still the SiriusXP3 thing.
10123923	10124904	What did he say about the controller?
10125505	10126827	What else could they say about the controller?
10127047	10130571	That you're going to use it in the stereoscopic 3D games.
10132413	10134695	Well, I don't know.
10134735	10135456	Maybe you're on to something.
10135516	10135937	We'll see.
10136157	10136477	I don't know.
10136758	10137899	And maybe we're fucking idiots.
10137959	10138239	I don't know.
10138279	10139180	We'll see soon enough.
10141155	10143676	But it's fun to imagine, isn't it?
10144416	10144896	Yeah, we will.
10145256	10146277	We'll be first in line.
10146937	10147917	Hopefully they won't kick us out.
10147937	10149738	We're going to let you go, buddy.
10149758	10151058	We've got to get to the next segment, alright?
10151999	10153339	But thank you for your input.
10153619	10154119	Have a good one.
10155100	10155400	You too.
10155560	10155840	Later.
10155860	10160221	Okay, I apologize to those folks we didn't get to on Skype.
10161422	10162982	We'll get to you guys next week.
10164143	10164643	Promise.
10165983	10169425	But we promised the chatters we'd get to some Ask Orange Lounge.
10169985	10171706	So therefore, that's what we're going to do right now.
10171806	10172647	Some Ask Orange Lounge.
10180051	10181312	Let's Ask Orange Lounge.
10181892	10183032	Some stupid question.
10183493	10186814	What will we find out this week on Orange Lounge Radio?
10187435	10191957	Maybe we'll find out how to unhook a bra or maybe not.
10192958	10193298	I don't know.
10193318	10194279	I don't want to finish that thought.
10194519	10194619	Um...
10197236	10198017	You rhymed anyway.
10198637	10207582	Sakurina says, I want to plug DSMeet.com, which is a DS Friends code sharing site that Loki joined, apparently.
10207722	10208543	Loki, is this true?
10208563	10209664	Are these allegations true?
10209864	10212385	Yeah, but I haven't visited the site since, and I was bored.
10212525	10215167	I thought our buddy BigRedPimp started his own thing.
10215287	10220169	Yeah, and you know what's funny is because I couldn't log into that thing at all because it was broken.
10220349	10221630	Email him and tell him he'll fix it.
10221690	10222330	I just don't care.
10222350	10222870	He loves you.
10223410	10230894	Alright, Sakurina wants to know, am I the only one to think Snow by Ram when you guys talk about Snow?
10232854	10235776	And I say no, you're probably not the only one to think about that song.
10235836	10238097	However, that does make you a loser.
10238757	10239217	Just kidding.
10240078	10240998	Hearts, love ya.
10242816	10243476	Just kidding.
10245417	10250138	Sephiroth1215 says, What do you think is the most overrated DDR song?
10250278	10253179	I say Butterfly, says Sephiroth1215.
10253519	10255480	Most overrated DDR song.
10256240	10257800	Maxx300, hands down.
10258101	10258881	Hands down, Maxx300.
10258961	10260841	DarkSakura.
10260861	10262422	Yeah, I'd have to agree.
10262582	10263082	Maxx300.
10263362	10263682	Loki.
10264122	10264322	Huh?
10264743	10266003	Most overrated DDR song.
10266815	10268917	Overrated DDR song, Max period.
10270278	10271059	We all said Max's.
10271499	10273801	And will you be my Animal Crossing friend?
10276283	10278184	Only if you let me abuse your town folk.
10279025	10281867	I'm going to leave signs in your town.
10282108	10284129	Yeah, and let us paint your town.
10285670	10286751	We'll paint your town gay.
10288733	10290134	We're going to come gay up your town.
10291335	10293397	We're going to give you a makeover, girlfriend!
10298527	10300388	I'm going to put up signs that just have bras on them.
10302510	10303851	That should be the new Orange Lounge logo.
10304331	10306353	I really hope that the town lesbian comes back.
10306513	10313558	By the way, I want to say just in time for Christmas, because I don't know why bras make me think of this, but the Orange Lounge t-shirt is going to happen.
10314798	10316260	We got a company to say they'd do it.
10316420	10317140	I'm very excited.
10317480	10319382	So we're going to talk about that later.
10319402	10320122	We're going to do it.
10320382	10321123	We're going to do it.
10323047	10327268	Illusion wants to know, what do you think is truly, truly, truly outrageous?
10327388	10329449	Jem and the Holograms or the Misfits?
10329589	10332069	Not the punk band, the original Misfits.
10333650	10337070	I would say, you know, Jem was the shit.
10337410	10339291	The Misfits were just a bunch of fucking wannabes.
10339471	10339851	I'm sorry.
10340571	10343092	Except the Misfits had Jetta later on.
10343572	10344832	And she played a black saxophone.
10344972	10345372	True.
10346693	10347813	It doesn't get cooler than that.
10347833	10348273	Your thoughts?
10348673	10349713	Jem or the Misfits?
10350034	10351814	I think her show sucked.
10354628	10356389	Yeah, well, I think you smell like butt.
10357609	10365312	Spirit Snare would like to know, what is the meaning of life, the universe, and everything to the X?
10365492	10365972	Forty-two.
10369754	10370074	Purple.
10371674	10372615	It's forty-two, really.
10372815	10373115	Purple.
10373375	10376456	That's the whole purpose of the Earth, was to calculate the meaning of life, and it's forty-two.
10376596	10376916	Purple.
10378217	10378517	Loki?
10379718	10380438	The meaning of life.
10381627	10385049	is to listen to Orange Launch Radio every Sunday night at 6.30 Pacific Standard Time.
10387390	10387550	No.
10387930	10390191	Oh, Jesus Christ, Rene just reminded me of something.
10391411	10398034	Have any of the hosts had a memorable moment, oh, this is from Rene, playing any DDR or music game in front of a crowd of sorts?
10399615	10409299	I have an alter ego known as Dr. Dick that does improv freestyle at some tournaments and got quite a big crowd at Pier 39 doing, what song did I do?
10409379	10410700	Was it Cowgirl I did at that one?
10411960	10413241	No, the first time was this Raining Men.
10413501	10413701	Yeah.
10413802	10415422	Was it Shaft 2 or something?
10415623	10416463	Yeah, Shaft.
10416823	10422166	And the second time Dr. Dick came out was doing Cowgirl at B3 is what it was called.
10422667	10423087	Good times.
10423867	10424188	Loki.
10425328	10426569	I think I'm the one involving you.
10426589	10428150	It was one of the first times I met you.
10428170	10434494	It was at the Sacramento's Cosplay and Tournament, and you did your routine dynamite rave, like, and you were dressed up all night.
10434534	10435354	Oh, yeah, I completely forgot.
10435374	10436315	And you fucking failed.
10437537	10438717	That's because I forgot my steps.
10439678	10444599	You started dancing and you were like getting down and doing the whole thing and then you were like, like you froze from it and you were like, aw shit.
10444659	10445379	And then you failed.
10446220	10448840	That wasn't like one of the first times you... I was like, that guy rocks.
10448900	10449301	No, it was.
10449341	10450261	It was later on.
10450301	10452081	But this was pre-OLR.
10452381	10453422	This was pre-OLR.
10456243	10456543	Alright.
10457623	10458523	DarkSakura, do you have any?
10458863	10459544	I can think of one.
10459904	10460844	It was you and me, but...
10461942	10467029	Let Doing Stomp to My Beat and Beating Each Other with the Orange Bats and Little Plastic Trumpets
10477205	10477665	DarkSakura.com
10501024	10501244	Catamaris
10525225	10525565	Enjoy.
10526366	10527726	And who won the cage match?
10528146	10529547	Is the thing he reminded me of.
10530047	10532308	Oh yeah, you guys want to know who won a cage match tonight, huh?
10532328	10534530	Because I completely forgot to mention it a little bit ago.
10535210	10538491	Tonight's cage match wiener is by, I think this is by one vote.
10538792	10539792	Yes, by only one vote.
10541633	10542073	Kat.
10545675	10548076	Let's face it, you've missed her from DDR, that's why you let her win.
10548897	10549277	Alright.
10550477	10551638	Thank you for reminding me, Renee.
10551698	10553419	God, if it wasn't for you, the show would be ruined.
10554905	10558128	Ron Chan wants to know, will you be doing some freestyling at KatsuCon?
10558509	10564675	Ron Chan, since you asked, I will bring the hat and the garb, and Dr. Dick will make an appearance.
10568591	10571653	NintendoManiac64 says, why are you guys so awesome?
10572093	10576196	I found a torrent for Japanese that took 46 hours to download and I already know some sentences.
10577397	10577878	Oh, God.
10578658	10580220	This person is making me read Japanese.
10580280	10580740	It's not fair.
10581481	10587065	Remember, Spanish.
10587886	10591609	I think I was close.
10591869	10592629	I think I was close.
10594371	10594591	Where?
10594951	10595271	Right there.
10595331	10595852	Starting right there.
10596423	10601947	I am Japanese... Japanese... What's Nihondo?
10602207	10605050	Oh, I think he meant, why did I type that with a D when it should have been a G?
10605210	10605470	Okay.
10606190	10611574	I am Japanese... Okay, it's supposed to be S-U-K-O...
10614269	10615569	Oh, who cares?
10615609	10616570	I'm trying to say Skoshee.
10616850	10617310	Oh, who cares?
10619050	10620330	No, I need to correct you.
10620370	10620570	Thank you.
10620611	10621091	All right.
10621991	10629813	Nintendo Maniac, what he really wants to know, is a Mario Kart DS online record of 199 wins and 34 losses good?
10631213	10632993	Yeah, but it means you do need to go outside more often.
10633313	10634234	Maybe race a real car.
10634474	10634894	Just kidding.
10634934	10635974	Just kidding.
10636014	10636734	Question for Loki.
10636774	10638775	Can I race you in Mario Kart DS again?
10638895	10640515	I remember that you're anti-snaking.
10641795	10642096	Loki.
10642236	10643096	I guess if I'm on.
10643136	10643356	All right.
10647923	10650845	Jada2005, what is the best metal DDR pad?
10650865	10652126	Because I want to get one for Christmas.
10653607	10655008	Red Octane's Afterburner, honestly.
10658111	10662093	Roz, why wouldn't the Java IRC client work?
10662174	10664915	I couldn't get into it and it made me late for the show chat.
10664956	10665316	Sadness.
10666176	10671600	I don't know because that's done by another company, but I'll look into it and see if it's just you or if it breaks for us too.
10671620	10673922	And if it breaks for us too, then we'll have to spank it.
10677009	10678850	Sephiroth 1215, by the way, had a follow-up.
10680271	10683192	That's okay if we want to visit his village, but please don't gay it up.
10689375	10696558	Legend of Zaku says, how come mainstream youth media outlets such as MTV only care about rap and sports games?
10697218	10704661	Because that, unfortunately, is what the people are buying, and if the people stop buying that shit, they will not promote it anymore, is my thought.
10704681	10705422	Because of cock.
10706826	10710710	Very, very Margaret Cho gay.
10731098	10734180	I don't have anything like that that I can find on demand.
10734300	10735160	Next week, honey, next week.
10735180	10735941	Then play the first one.
10736001	10736261	All right.
10736641	10737081	You got it.
10738822	10740623	You know what would be perfect for that?
10740943	10741123	What?
10741143	10742364	It would be Hooray for Boobies.
10743644	10745685	Hooray for Boobies would be a good one, but I don't have that.
10747106	10748107	We got more questions, kids.
10748427	10753770	Do you know we don't have that song from Beaches where Bette Midler was singing the origination of the bird?
10753790	10756671	Did you ever know that you're mine here?
10757011	10757271	The...
10759625	10761585	The Over-the-Shoulder Boulder Holder.
10763066	10763626	Oh, Jesus Christ.
10763646	10766166	You remember when she was singing about... Oh, my God.
10766186	10769407	About... Somehow you have outgayed me.
10769527	10770187	Good job.
10770627	10771688	Good job.
10771708	10772648	Otto Titzlinger.
10772708	10773308	That was it.
10773628	10775648	I have no idea what Titzlinger was.
10775708	10777929	Well played, DarkSakura.
10777949	10778929	Well played.
10779489	10780770	You have outgayed me.
10780990	10782770	That's just my favorite song in that movie.
10786303	10788286	Alright, question from DarkTetsuya.
10788626	10789767	Have you seen the Carl's Jr.
10789808	10795395	Milkshake commercial and do you find it ironic that they used Get Busy since they had the DDR promotion last month?
10798078	10800321	Well, that and Let's See.
10806112	10819280	You know, I can't... Look, why would you use... Why would you use that song when there is the completely more obvious song that you use in your milkshake commercial?
10821742	10825444	Because most people listen to... Wait, hold on, hold on.
10825544	10826284	E. Carl's Jr.
10836229	10836469	See?
10836950	10837910	I should produce commercials.
10841313	10843075	I forgot about the DDR promotion last month.
10843535	10843875	My bad.
10845977	10848119	Goggles says, what is your favorite Christmas song?
10848159	10852383	My favorite Christmas song is Little Drummer Boy because I get to say pa rum pa pum pum.
10852783	10854584	I also, Grandma Got Run Over by a Reindeer.
10854624	10855085	Close second.
10855585	10860389	My favorite one is Dancing Around in Women's Underwear.

10867095	10867535	All right.
10867835	10869917	Actually, I also like The Night Santa Went Crazy.
10871618	10872399	Last one, last one.
10873199	10877263	NeoDude0 wants to know, do any of you play Magic the Gathering?
10878404	10878904	I used to.
10879124	10879564	I used to.
10879805	10881966	I had, like, all blackboarded cards.
10882367	10883408	They were betas and alphas.
10884669	10886470	I still have my 4th edition stuff.
10886770	10887491	Nerd!
10887511	10890713	Yeah, but I don't play it anymore.
10890974	10892995	I can play sometimes.
10893015	10893135	Nerd!
10894376	10902423	Sometimes late at night you take them out and you tickle yourself with them.
10903304	10905706	I need to tap my mana.
10905726	10907687	I need another thrall token.
10908488	10909249	Swarm me.
10909349	10911170	At least I didn't say Felden's cane.
10912992	10915934	I need me an acid manipulator.
10921098	10921699	I hate this show.
10922179	10924241	All right.
10924581	10926302	That's going to do it because I hate this show.
10926603	10930426	We're going to finish up and put the nail in the proverbial coffin of this program.
10931587	10932788	Thank you folks for listening.
10932808	10936090	We'll be back next week with more of the same shit that you know and love.
10938632	10939433	Final thought time.
10939593	10942095	Angel, I hope you had a good show.
10942455	10943076	Yes, I did.
10943156	10943416	Good.
10943656	10946259	And good people came over and it was all good.
10946479	10946699	Good.
10946999	10947860	What's your final thought, my dear?
10950133	10951153	Must get that job.
10952253	10952474	Yes.
10953094	10953874	Good luck, my friend.
10954014	10955295	Loki, final thought.
10955995	10957175	Must eat more brownies.
10957215	10958556	Stop stuffing your face with brownies.
10959096	10961117	How much weight have you gained since The Biggest Gainer started?
10961137	10961377	I don't know.
10961397	10961917	I haven't checked.
10962497	10964158	We haven't done weigh-ins in weeks.
10964238	10964498	I know.
10964598	10965519	Well, Extover's not here.
10966059	10968200	But I've been uber-sick.
10968460	10968660	Yeah.
10968880	10971021	So we'll do another weigh-in next week.
10971041	10971901	But I win anyway.
10973001	10973242	I know.
10973302	10974262	DarkSakura, your final thought.
10975801	10977562	I hope that I'm over the plague soon.
10977682	10981364	But the final, the really, really major thing is reject false icons.
10983004	10986806	My final thought is Velcro bras, the wave of the future.
10988546	10988907	That's it.
10989947	10991968	One word, one word to sum it all up.
10992008	10994369	The final word of the show, the nail in the coffin.
10994769	10995849	It is Angel's birthday.
10995969	10997370	I will let her have the final word.
10997810	10998670	What is it, my friend?
