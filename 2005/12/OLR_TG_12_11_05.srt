00:00:00,149 --> 00:00:02,611
[SPEAKER_04]: Orange Lounge Radio To Go Edition, week of December 12th, 2005.

2
00:00:02,832 --> 00:00:13,181
[SPEAKER_02]: You're tuned in to the Orange Lounge Radio To Go Edition, your podcast home for all the latest video game news and gamer chat.

3
00:00:13,422 --> 00:00:16,845
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, here are your hosts, DarkSakura, Sky, and Loki.

4
00:00:18,615 --> 00:00:30,012
[SPEAKER_04]: Hello everybody once again and welcome to Orange Lounge Radio To Go, your home for discussion on video games, video game news, video game discussion about games that don't suck.

5
00:00:30,473 --> 00:00:34,319
[SPEAKER_04]: But sometimes we do have to talk about games that do suck just to tell you to avoid them.

6
00:00:34,819 --> 00:00:37,781
[SPEAKER_04]: Tonight is episode 50 of our podcast.

7
00:00:37,961 --> 00:00:38,381
[SPEAKER_04]: Yay.

8
00:00:39,022 --> 00:00:40,743
[SPEAKER_04]: It means 50 weeks in a row we've been here.

9
00:00:41,303 --> 00:00:42,464
[SPEAKER_04]: Podcasting is that new.

10
00:00:42,924 --> 00:00:46,807
[SPEAKER_04]: It's only been around like a little bit in a year, you know, so it's kind of cool.

11
00:00:47,947 --> 00:00:50,389
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're just a couple weeks from our one year anniversary, of course, that means.

12
00:00:51,730 --> 00:00:54,892
[SPEAKER_04]: With me, as always, is the one and only Dark Sakura.

13
00:00:55,452 --> 00:00:55,772
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi.

14
00:00:56,152 --> 00:00:56,573
[SPEAKER_04]: How you doing?

15
00:00:57,673 --> 00:00:58,994
[SPEAKER_00]: My voice keeps coming and going.

16
00:00:59,755 --> 00:01:01,636
[SPEAKER_04]: You still have the plague.

17
00:01:01,676 --> 00:01:02,036
[SPEAKER_04]: Plaguey.

18
00:01:03,536 --> 00:01:04,597
[SPEAKER_00]: I do still have the plague.

19
00:01:04,637 --> 00:01:09,779
[SPEAKER_00]: It sucks because I've learned that lung cookies really are not a delicacy.

20
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:11,340
[SPEAKER_04]: I see.

21
00:01:12,741 --> 00:01:14,702
[SPEAKER_04]: Also with us, say hello to the one and only Loki.

22
00:01:14,922 --> 00:01:15,322
[SPEAKER_04]: Hello.

23
00:01:15,482 --> 00:01:16,062
[SPEAKER_04]: How are you doing?

24
00:01:16,763 --> 00:01:17,643
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm quite stuffed up.

25
00:01:18,304 --> 00:01:19,985
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm also sick, so you know what that means.

26
00:01:20,225 --> 00:01:22,906
[SPEAKER_04]: All three of us are sick.

27
00:01:22,926 --> 00:01:25,047
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think we all have the plague, but we all have something bad.

28
00:01:25,067 --> 00:01:25,527
[SPEAKER_04]: I have the plague.

29
00:01:26,128 --> 00:01:26,308
[SPEAKER_04]: I know.

30
00:01:26,588 --> 00:01:26,948
[SPEAKER_04]: It's horrible.

31
00:01:26,968 --> 00:01:28,569
[SPEAKER_04]: We had to cancel our live show this week.

32
00:01:28,649 --> 00:01:30,030
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you both have the microplague.

33
00:01:30,370 --> 00:01:30,710
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe.

34
00:01:31,030 --> 00:01:31,611
[SPEAKER_04]: Mini-plague.

35
00:01:31,731 --> 00:01:32,211
[SPEAKER_00]: Mini-plague.

36
00:01:33,052 --> 00:01:34,614
[SPEAKER_00]: I shall call it mini-plague.

37
00:01:35,054 --> 00:01:37,076
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know, but it sucks.

38
00:01:38,757 --> 00:01:40,359
[SPEAKER_04]: We weren't going to call in sick for episode 50.

39
00:01:40,659 --> 00:01:44,542
[SPEAKER_04]: This would happen to us on a landmark-style show to us.

40
00:01:46,164 --> 00:01:48,065
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, let's get into it.

41
00:01:48,285 --> 00:01:49,446
[SPEAKER_04]: Same schtick as always.

42
00:01:49,867 --> 00:01:52,149
[SPEAKER_04]: What kind of stuff have you been playing this week, DarkSakura?

43
00:01:53,410 --> 00:01:54,211
[SPEAKER_00]: Animal Crossing.

44
00:01:55,632 --> 00:01:59,095
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been playing with my villagers and hitting you in the head with a net.

45
00:02:00,391 --> 00:02:02,952
[SPEAKER_00]: and hitting people I don't know in your village with a net.

46
00:02:03,753 --> 00:02:05,474
[SPEAKER_00]: And I stubbed you in the toe with my shovel.

47
00:02:05,954 --> 00:02:08,115
[SPEAKER_04]: And you also planted a pitfall that I fell into, thank you.

48
00:02:08,695 --> 00:02:13,257
[SPEAKER_00]: I planted one for myself so that I could fall into it right in front of you to make you feel better.

49
00:02:13,658 --> 00:02:18,520
[SPEAKER_04]: But you got out of it before I was able to get my bug net out and start whacking you while you were in the hole, so it made me sad.

50
00:02:19,741 --> 00:02:20,001
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry.

51
00:02:20,461 --> 00:02:23,042
[SPEAKER_00]: This is me giving you a flat look that our listeners can't hear.

52
00:02:24,423 --> 00:02:25,023
[SPEAKER_00]: Great radio.

53
00:02:25,644 --> 00:02:25,904
[SPEAKER_00]: I, uh...

54
00:02:27,077 --> 00:02:44,650
[SPEAKER_00]: I also have been watching Dan play a lot of that game that I'm getting really bored of watching, the Project Gotham Racing 3, because it looks like the cars are still floating over the ground, and that's all I hear is, Crash!

55
00:02:46,391 --> 00:02:46,811
[SPEAKER_00]: Shit!

56
00:02:48,673 --> 00:02:49,153
[SPEAKER_00]: No!

57
00:02:49,233 --> 00:02:49,874
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't go that way!

58
00:02:51,635 --> 00:02:55,858
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, I also hear the same thing while he's playing Need for Speed Underground on the Xbox.

59
00:02:56,829 --> 00:03:09,092
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been playing Animal Crossing, which is fun, and I've been playing a little bit Need for Speed, or not Need for Speed, Average Racer 6, because that's cool.

60
00:03:11,093 --> 00:03:11,813
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been playing...

61
00:03:24,787 --> 00:03:28,871
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, very, very little of Project Gotham because I kind of suck at the game.

62
00:03:29,371 --> 00:03:29,851
[SPEAKER_03]: Amp 3.

63
00:03:29,972 --> 00:03:30,912
[SPEAKER_03]: Amp 3 is really fun.

64
00:03:32,234 --> 00:03:38,599
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, and I finally got my 360 because I had to go buy it from somebody who was charging an exorbitant amount of money for it.

65
00:03:39,940 --> 00:03:40,340
[SPEAKER_03]: But you know what?

66
00:03:40,381 --> 00:03:40,901
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm satisfied.

67
00:03:41,882 --> 00:03:42,362
[SPEAKER_03]: Shame!

68
00:03:43,163 --> 00:03:43,683
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what?

69
00:03:44,184 --> 00:03:45,545
[SPEAKER_03]: It's all Microsoft's fault.

70
00:03:45,805 --> 00:03:47,667
[SPEAKER_00]: Our listeners can't see me pointing and laughing.

71
00:03:48,848 --> 00:03:49,348
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

72
00:03:49,388 --> 00:03:50,589
[SPEAKER_04]: You let me down, Loki.

73
00:03:50,709 --> 00:03:52,331
[SPEAKER_04]: No, it's... You know...

74
00:03:53,390 --> 00:03:53,650
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura,

75
00:04:24,690 --> 00:04:25,070
[SPEAKER_03]: That is it.

76
00:04:25,431 --> 00:04:25,671
[SPEAKER_03]: Two.

77
00:04:28,693 --> 00:04:31,395
[SPEAKER_03]: At that rate, my 360 would arrive in February.

78
00:04:33,677 --> 00:04:38,000
[SPEAKER_04]: So now, didn't you get a tip that a bunch of Best Buys are getting a bunch more 360s on a particular day?

79
00:04:38,020 --> 00:04:39,101
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I don't want to wait in line.

80
00:04:39,802 --> 00:04:41,983
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't want to wait early in the morning in line for this stuff.

81
00:04:42,003 --> 00:04:44,145
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, what about our listeners who might want to know the tip?

82
00:04:46,046 --> 00:04:52,271
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, there's going to be a lot of 360s arriving at Best Buy for their December 18th sale.

83
00:04:52,671 --> 00:04:53,452
[SPEAKER_03]: They're going to have

84
00:04:54,016 --> 00:04:55,277
[SPEAKER_03]: At least 20 per store.

85
00:04:56,458 --> 00:04:57,659
[SPEAKER_03]: Some a lot more than that.

86
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:02,063
[SPEAKER_03]: And you can actually find... There's a whole list I posted in my live journal.

87
00:05:02,303 --> 00:05:03,744
[SPEAKER_04]: Where did you figure this out?

88
00:05:03,784 --> 00:05:05,826
[SPEAKER_04]: Because the list you got looked really official.

89
00:05:05,966 --> 00:05:07,187
[SPEAKER_03]: It's on GameFAQs.

90
00:05:08,328 --> 00:05:12,051
[SPEAKER_03]: Someone had posted a list that I guess is off of a printout or something.

91
00:05:12,091 --> 00:05:17,195
[SPEAKER_03]: But anyways, basically most of the stores like an R. We're getting 24 per store.

92
00:05:17,295 --> 00:05:19,717
[SPEAKER_03]: One of them was getting 30 or 40, I think.

93
00:05:19,917 --> 00:05:22,019
[SPEAKER_03]: But that's about it.

94
00:05:22,099 --> 00:05:22,660
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, so...

95
00:05:23,575 --> 00:05:25,758
[SPEAKER_03]: If you want one, you better be waiting in line again.

96
00:05:25,798 --> 00:05:27,540
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like the launch all over again.

97
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:35,529
[SPEAKER_03]: Which I find funny because Best Buy is getting, what, like, tons of these 360s and GameStop is getting two.

98
00:05:37,191 --> 00:05:37,671
[SPEAKER_03]: What the hell?

99
00:05:38,813 --> 00:05:42,457
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, that's because for every Best Buy there's like 20 GameStops, at least in this area.

100
00:05:43,578 --> 00:05:44,278
[SPEAKER_03]: It's ridiculous.

101
00:05:44,378 --> 00:05:47,859
[SPEAKER_03]: But anyways, the whole thing is just, it's a big rip-off.

102
00:05:47,899 --> 00:05:54,081
[SPEAKER_03]: And before you go and buy your 360, take a good look at what accessories you need and how much those are going to cost.

103
00:05:54,561 --> 00:05:55,361
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me tell you this much.

104
00:05:56,442 --> 00:06:02,923
[SPEAKER_03]: I ended up using my entire pre-order amount of money on the 360 that I had on there.

105
00:06:03,303 --> 00:06:04,464
[SPEAKER_03]: $430 on accessories.

106
00:06:05,144 --> 00:06:07,345
[SPEAKER_03]: That is how much their fucking accessories cost.

107
00:06:08,525 --> 00:06:11,886
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, those controllers, $50 each for the wireless ones.

108
00:06:12,086 --> 00:06:12,266
[SPEAKER_03]: Those

109
00:06:12,628 --> 00:06:15,889
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, component cables, try $40 for stupid cables.

110
00:06:15,989 --> 00:06:17,530
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it's ridiculous.

111
00:06:17,850 --> 00:06:19,631
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you get a core system, good luck.

112
00:06:20,711 --> 00:06:31,175
[SPEAKER_00]: I do understand that someone went into, I think it was at my husband's store, and dropped three grand on his Platinum 360 with controllers and games.

113
00:06:33,616 --> 00:06:33,816
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.

114
00:06:34,955 --> 00:06:36,376
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't feel sorry for them one bit.

115
00:06:37,057 --> 00:06:42,622
[SPEAKER_03]: For them losing, oh, poor things losing $140 per system they sell.

116
00:06:43,023 --> 00:06:45,085
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, don't fucking care, okay?

117
00:06:46,846 --> 00:06:48,788
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, even, I had to get a core system.

118
00:06:48,868 --> 00:06:49,589
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the one I got.

119
00:06:50,310 --> 00:06:52,392
[SPEAKER_03]: And it has composite cables with it.

120
00:06:52,732 --> 00:06:54,654
[SPEAKER_03]: The composite cables only have S-video on them.

121
00:06:54,694 --> 00:06:56,415
[SPEAKER_03]: You have to buy separate cables, which are $30.

122
00:06:56,796 --> 00:06:59,278
[SPEAKER_03]: Way more than any other cables I've seen.

123
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:00,179
[SPEAKER_03]: But, uh,

124
00:07:04,822 --> 00:07:18,095
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think you need anything better than Composite unless you're running an HDTV or like a computer monitor or something.

125
00:07:18,616 --> 00:07:22,680
[SPEAKER_03]: The only thing that you will run into is that text is hard to read if you don't have S-Video or something like that.

126
00:07:24,022 --> 00:07:24,342
[SPEAKER_03]: That's it.

127
00:07:25,433 --> 00:07:27,054
[SPEAKER_04]: So what are your impressions of Xbox 360?

128
00:07:27,254 --> 00:07:29,314
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it worth all the money you poured into it?

129
00:07:29,875 --> 00:07:38,138
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, yeah, because I'm going to use it a lot here and with my job at work and stuff, so it is worth it in that sense.

130
00:07:38,618 --> 00:07:39,978
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was going to pick it up at some point.

131
00:07:40,399 --> 00:07:42,959
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, other people have done the same, you know, they spent money on it.

132
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:48,041
[SPEAKER_03]: And I just, I don't see, I had like six games waiting for the system.

133
00:07:48,121 --> 00:07:51,783
[SPEAKER_03]: I just didn't want to wait another two months to be able to not play these games or whatever.

134
00:07:52,663 --> 00:07:54,843
[SPEAKER_03]: But so far, you know, I like it.

135
00:07:55,044 --> 00:07:55,704
[SPEAKER_03]: It's pretty fun.

136
00:07:55,944 --> 00:08:00,305
[SPEAKER_03]: It's definitely a pretty good game system.

137
00:08:00,325 --> 00:08:07,546
[SPEAKER_03]: Project Gotham, though, is more like Gran Turismo than me, and I don't really like Gran Turismo, but it is still pretty, you know, it's a nice game.

138
00:08:08,226 --> 00:08:09,447
[SPEAKER_03]: But I don't know.

139
00:08:09,607 --> 00:08:17,468
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm hoping that most of these games that come out, because I haven't played a lot of the games yet, aren't just all pretty graphics and horrible gameplay.

140
00:08:18,348 --> 00:08:20,409
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you get a chance to play Perfect Dark Zero yet?

141
00:08:20,749 --> 00:08:21,069
[SPEAKER_03]: Not yet.

142
00:08:21,459 --> 00:08:21,919
[SPEAKER_00]: Project Gotham

143
00:08:44,060 --> 00:08:45,081
[SPEAKER_04]: But, um, I don't know.

144
00:08:45,541 --> 00:08:50,245
[SPEAKER_04]: It just seemed like all it was was stuff that the Xbox could do, but now supporting HDTV.

145
00:08:50,285 --> 00:08:55,049
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm thinking, you know, if this, you know, I'm lucky to have a 30-something inch HDTV.

146
00:08:55,549 --> 00:08:59,993
[SPEAKER_04]: If I didn't have that, I don't think the game would look that much better than the regular Xbox.

147
00:09:00,173 --> 00:09:04,717
[SPEAKER_04]: So, or a computer monitor or something else to hook it up to that can support the higher-end textures.

148
00:09:05,177 --> 00:09:05,758
[SPEAKER_04]: So, I don't know.

149
00:09:06,118 --> 00:09:06,798
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not sure I...

150
00:09:07,739 --> 00:09:09,041
[SPEAKER_04]: Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter

151
00:09:27,813 --> 00:09:29,555
[SPEAKER_04]: I kind of think at this point they should have just waited.

152
00:09:30,776 --> 00:09:31,276
[SPEAKER_04]: They should have.

153
00:09:31,697 --> 00:09:35,220
[SPEAKER_04]: I understand why they were trying to rush for Christmas.

154
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:40,584
[SPEAKER_04]: They have become the talked about item for Christmas, which is what they wanted, but at what price?

155
00:09:40,945 --> 00:09:46,510
[SPEAKER_03]: I think they've really fucked up this whole launch, and a lot of people are definitely pissed off at them.

156
00:09:46,910 --> 00:09:53,076
[SPEAKER_03]: Granted, some people are going to care and they're still going to get their 360, but some of them are saying, fuck this, I'm going to wait for the PS3.

157
00:09:53,896 --> 00:10:17,952
[SPEAKER_04]: and I mean even if that is a small percentage that's still your core customers you're losing because you chose to do this I don't know don't you think though that with the right game those people would come back to play Devil's Advocate a little bit don't you think with the right game coming out in the future you know especially you know what is what is it the Xbox 360 lacks right now role-playing games right let's say that you know with with all these developments that some of the folks that were working for Square going over to make games for the 360 starting their own company

158
00:10:18,254 --> 00:10:24,099
[SPEAKER_04]: When some of these games come out, that's going to make the 360 a hell of a lot more desirable no matter how bad their launch was.

159
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:28,643
[SPEAKER_03]: All the pencils coming out for the PS3 and all that stuff too.

160
00:10:29,124 --> 00:10:45,018
[SPEAKER_00]: Microsoft did get support from Sega, Tetsuya Mizuguchi, Sakaguchi, Okamoto, all the big guys that were with Square, Capcom.

161
00:10:45,778 --> 00:10:49,041
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, so it's interesting to see what's going to be coming up in the future.

162
00:10:49,142 --> 00:10:49,442
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

163
00:10:49,842 --> 00:10:56,809
[SPEAKER_04]: I just think, although this launch might be screwy, and people are talking shit now, I think people are going to overlook it in a year.

164
00:10:57,269 --> 00:11:03,255
[SPEAKER_04]: But you're right, it really depends on the strength of the PS3, but hopefully Sony's taking notes and they'll have enough chips when they're ready to go.

165
00:11:03,795 --> 00:11:08,199
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, hopefully it comes down to, let's not all launch, the worldwide launch was dumb.

166
00:11:08,860 --> 00:11:09,641
[SPEAKER_03]: It was really dumb.

167
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:13,001
[SPEAKER_04]: And they didn't truly launch worldwide.

168
00:11:13,041 --> 00:11:14,522
[SPEAKER_04]: They launched in three major markets.

169
00:11:14,902 --> 00:11:15,662
[SPEAKER_03]: The three biggest markets.

170
00:11:15,742 --> 00:11:18,044
[SPEAKER_03]: You split up your systems and you have shortages in three countries.

171
00:11:18,484 --> 00:11:19,525
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't call that worldwide launch.

172
00:11:19,565 --> 00:11:21,066
[SPEAKER_03]: I call that, oh, I shipped somebody.

173
00:11:21,126 --> 00:11:22,026
[SPEAKER_03]: It's someplace else.

174
00:11:22,046 --> 00:11:23,367
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, good point.

175
00:11:23,887 --> 00:11:27,109
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, anyway, as far as other games I played this week, of course, Animal Crossing is big news.

176
00:11:27,350 --> 00:11:28,770
[SPEAKER_04]: And I've checked out Animal Crossing.

177
00:11:29,371 --> 00:11:31,892
[SPEAKER_04]: It's very similar to the GameCube version.

178
00:11:32,133 --> 00:11:34,034
[SPEAKER_04]: I kind of call it Animal Crossing Plus.

179
00:11:34,912 --> 00:11:35,412
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

180
00:11:52,788 --> 00:12:01,490
[SPEAKER_04]: It does, but that's okay because... The land is different, but it makes it nice, makes it that seamless feeling to it.

181
00:12:01,790 --> 00:12:06,211
[SPEAKER_04]: It sounds like the objectives take longer, and of course the Wi-Fi is pretty cool.

182
00:12:06,871 --> 00:12:08,092
[SPEAKER_04]: The first couple days were rough.

183
00:12:08,132 --> 00:12:13,493
[SPEAKER_04]: I was getting a lot of communication errors those first two days, but it's calmed down a lot, and I've had a lot of people in and out of my village.

184
00:12:13,793 --> 00:12:14,193
[SPEAKER_04]: What can I say?

185
00:12:14,213 --> 00:12:17,354
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm an Animal Crossing whore.

186
00:12:17,954 --> 00:12:19,354
[SPEAKER_04]: Overall, the experience has been pretty good.

187
00:12:19,434 --> 00:12:21,475
[SPEAKER_04]: Sometimes it can be really slow that...

188
00:12:22,318 --> 00:12:23,258
[SPEAKER_04]: Wifi stuff.

189
00:12:23,318 --> 00:12:29,741
[SPEAKER_04]: Not that you get lagged, but that when somebody comes into your village, save, wait, here they come, save.

190
00:12:30,001 --> 00:12:33,903
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a pretty slow process, but overall, can't complain.

191
00:12:34,283 --> 00:12:40,206
[SPEAKER_04]: It certainly adds so much more to the game where you don't have to be taking a physical memory card over to somebody else's house.

192
00:12:40,706 --> 00:12:45,208
[SPEAKER_04]: If you enjoyed Animal Crossing on the GameCube, you will enjoy this on the DS.

193
00:12:45,768 --> 00:12:49,810
[SPEAKER_04]: I think you'll kind of find that you're kind of rediscovering what you liked about Animal Crossing 1 all over again.

194
00:12:49,850 --> 00:12:51,131
[SPEAKER_04]: My fear about this game

195
00:12:51,591 --> 00:12:55,332
[SPEAKER_04]: is that it's going to be another Nintendogs that in two weeks none of us will be playing it anymore.

196
00:12:56,213 --> 00:12:57,373
[SPEAKER_04]: After we all pay off our houses.

197
00:12:57,413 --> 00:12:58,613
[SPEAKER_04]: That was the problem with Animal Crossing 1.

198
00:12:58,914 --> 00:13:00,534
[SPEAKER_04]: After everybody paid off their house, oh, bye game.

199
00:13:01,634 --> 00:13:02,835
[SPEAKER_04]: And I don't know.

200
00:13:04,876 --> 00:13:06,416
[SPEAKER_04]: It's typical to say at this point.

201
00:13:06,676 --> 00:13:10,638
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's also, you know, not trying to collect all the retro Nintendo games anymore.

202
00:13:10,658 --> 00:13:11,698
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, you don't have that anymore.

203
00:13:11,718 --> 00:13:13,779
[SPEAKER_00]: I know people who still tend to their GameCube houses.

204
00:13:14,539 --> 00:13:16,820
[SPEAKER_00]: I know, and there's always going to be... There's also babysitting my village.

205
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:20,701
[SPEAKER_04]: There's going to be the hardcore, you know, people, but for the average gamer...

206
00:13:21,477 --> 00:13:23,418
[SPEAKER_04]: I think they're going to move on after a couple weeks.

207
00:13:23,698 --> 00:13:26,078
[SPEAKER_04]: I just have this bad feeling it's going to be another Nintendogs.

208
00:13:26,598 --> 00:13:26,879
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

209
00:13:26,919 --> 00:13:29,659
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it'll last longer than Nintendogs because I think there's more to do.

210
00:13:30,279 --> 00:13:32,320
[SPEAKER_04]: But I just, I don't know.

211
00:13:32,340 --> 00:13:36,621
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't see this thrill lasting, especially with, you know, games that are going to be coming out in January, February.

212
00:13:37,061 --> 00:13:38,702
[SPEAKER_04]: I think this was a good time for the game to come out.

213
00:13:39,902 --> 00:13:40,802
[SPEAKER_04]: But I don't know.

214
00:13:40,822 --> 00:13:43,083
[SPEAKER_04]: I just don't see the honeymoon lasting forever with Animal Crossing.

215
00:13:43,835 --> 00:13:53,035
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's going to stick around for a little while we'll see ever since I got Animal Crossing I haven't touched Mario Kart I'll probably go back to that though anyway

216
00:13:54,116 --> 00:13:54,236
[SPEAKER_04]: XBOX 360

217
00:14:14,813 --> 00:14:15,654
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura.com

218
00:14:36,829 --> 00:14:40,955
[SPEAKER_04]: There, of course, Microsoft is not calling this a failure yet in Japan.

219
00:14:41,055 --> 00:14:47,724
[SPEAKER_04]: I think a lot of, you know, you can really tell who the MS fanboys and the anti-MS fanboys are because, you know, I'm sure the anti-Microsoft...

220
00:14:50,525 --> 00:14:51,246
[SPEAKER_04]: My mic went out again.

221
00:14:51,366 --> 00:14:55,168
[SPEAKER_04]: The anti-Microsoft people are quick to jump on this and say, oh, they failed.

222
00:14:55,608 --> 00:14:56,948
[SPEAKER_04]: Xbox 360 failed in Japan.

223
00:14:57,709 --> 00:14:58,209
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

224
00:14:59,590 --> 00:15:02,231
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been pretty critical of Microsoft in the past.

225
00:15:02,812 --> 00:15:03,212
[SPEAKER_04]: Stupid mic.

226
00:15:03,512 --> 00:15:09,015
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been pretty critical of Microsoft in the past, but I don't say just because they had a slower launch, don't count them out.

227
00:15:09,395 --> 00:15:12,777
[SPEAKER_04]: Again, we were just talking about, you know, the big games are going to be coming out.

228
00:15:13,726 --> 00:15:20,030
[SPEAKER_04]: Later next year, and what are the games that Japanese gamers really want that aren't out on the Xbox 360 at all right now?

229
00:15:20,431 --> 00:15:21,331
[SPEAKER_03]: Enchanted Arm.

230
00:15:22,152 --> 00:15:23,273
[SPEAKER_04]: RPGs in general.

231
00:15:23,453 --> 00:15:25,094
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm sorry, Cameo does not count.

232
00:15:25,614 --> 00:15:26,235
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a platformer.

233
00:15:26,455 --> 00:15:26,655
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

234
00:15:27,035 --> 00:15:30,017
[SPEAKER_04]: So, don't count it out in Japan yet.

235
00:15:30,117 --> 00:15:35,721
[SPEAKER_04]: Wait and see what happens when the dudes from Final Fantasy put out their game on the Xbox 360 or whatever it is they're planning.

236
00:15:36,021 --> 00:15:37,482
[SPEAKER_04]: Wait and see how that does or doesn't do.

237
00:15:38,043 --> 00:15:39,864
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the true indication of how the system's going to do.

238
00:15:40,224 --> 00:15:40,544
[SPEAKER_04]: I think.

239
00:15:41,405 --> 00:15:42,946
[SPEAKER_04]: Jamie, you have kind of a follow-up on that?

240
00:15:43,769 --> 00:16:07,725
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, yeah, just a lot of the market analysts in Japan are really, really down on it, saying that... In fact, there's a quote on here saying that they previously thought the Xbox 360 would gain a major share of Japanese market by taking some of the share from Sony, but now that prospect might not be realized given the limited attractiveness of its titles and lukewarm functions.

241
00:16:07,765 --> 00:16:09,946
[SPEAKER_00]: That last part's a direct quote.

242
00:16:10,186 --> 00:16:10,707
[SPEAKER_00]: However...

243
00:16:11,958 --> 00:16:23,568
[SPEAKER_00]: CESA survey at the Tokyo Game Show was saying that 23% of the consumers want an Xbox 360 compared to under 21% interested in the Revolution.

244
00:16:35,851 --> 00:16:47,577
[SPEAKER_00]: But see, the thing that gets me is that all these analysts are talking about, oh, PlayStation 3, PlayStation 3, they're comparing, they're basically comparing what exists to what might exist.

245
00:16:47,837 --> 00:17:01,424
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we've seen the demo, the tech, I'm sure all of us will, saw a lot of the demo stuff, you know, that's out on the internet now for the PlayStation 3, and I went and did that pretty little show they had at E3, but honestly...

246
00:17:02,970 --> 00:17:04,731
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't count your chickens before they're hatched.

247
00:17:05,132 --> 00:17:13,238
[SPEAKER_04]: Same with Nintendo because Nintendo is, you know, they're taking what's always been oranges and making apples now.

248
00:17:13,699 --> 00:17:14,759
[SPEAKER_04]: At least it's what they say.

249
00:17:14,780 --> 00:17:19,063
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, the revolution and everything is going to be not literally making apples.

250
00:17:19,123 --> 00:17:20,244
[SPEAKER_04]: We don't know that they've teamed up yet.

251
00:17:20,264 --> 00:17:25,948
[SPEAKER_04]: But, you know, it's certainly interesting because Nintendo, it almost sounds like, wants to go off in this entire other direction.

252
00:17:25,968 --> 00:17:27,330
[SPEAKER_04]: They're like, you know, screw specs.

253
00:17:27,670 --> 00:17:28,551
[SPEAKER_04]: We've got something better.

254
00:17:29,671 --> 00:17:29,972
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

255
00:17:31,473 --> 00:17:31,553
[SPEAKER_00]: Ugh.

256
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:37,742
[SPEAKER_00]: I glanced over an article a few days ago where MTV got their hands on a revolution to try it out.

257
00:17:37,762 --> 00:17:39,903
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't remember them being overly excited.

258
00:17:39,923 --> 00:17:41,584
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I'm sure they gave the revolution the plague.

259
00:17:43,325 --> 00:17:47,006
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki, you have some more information about some interesting developments on the revolution?

260
00:17:47,066 --> 00:17:48,847
[SPEAKER_04]: Some type of patent or something going on there?

261
00:17:48,887 --> 00:17:55,370
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, the revolution, they've got basically these patents for... It's two patents for displacement mapping.

262
00:17:55,390 --> 00:17:59,392
[SPEAKER_03]: It's basically a technique used to kind of ease...

263
00:18:00,962 --> 00:18:24,357
[SPEAKER_03]: rendering 3D and 2D and what they've done is the first patent is actually about the displacement mapping itself, the actual rendering and the second is on a technique that uses basically less of the CPU to render the stuff to make basically their less powerful system just as powerful is basically what it is.

264
00:18:25,143 --> 00:18:31,690
[SPEAKER_04]: So my big question is, does this support your theory that the revolution, your ongoing theory throughout our past few episodes that the revolution is 3D?

265
00:18:32,251 --> 00:18:34,373
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't even think of the term now.

266
00:18:34,954 --> 00:18:35,615
[SPEAKER_04]: Stereoscopic 3D.

267
00:18:35,635 --> 00:18:36,215
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, thank you.

268
00:18:36,235 --> 00:18:38,638
[SPEAKER_03]: Stereoscopic 3D.

269
00:18:38,958 --> 00:18:40,240
[SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't really add to anything.

270
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:43,083
[SPEAKER_03]: It's basically saying that it can render stuff a lot faster.

271
00:18:43,649 --> 00:18:44,049
[SPEAKER_04]: Interesting.

272
00:18:45,030 --> 00:18:45,351
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll see.

273
00:18:46,031 --> 00:18:47,393
[SPEAKER_04]: I have some news over on PlayStation 3.

274
00:18:48,674 --> 00:18:55,100
[SPEAKER_04]: People are saying that there's no way in hell PlayStation 3 is going to launch in spring, and Sony reassured this week, yes, they will.

275
00:18:55,140 --> 00:18:57,182
[SPEAKER_04]: They will be releasing in the spring.

276
00:18:58,163 --> 00:18:59,224
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe not in the U.S., though.

277
00:19:00,525 --> 00:19:03,347
[SPEAKER_04]: But they will release in the spring, at least in Japan.

278
00:19:03,987 --> 00:19:04,967
[SPEAKER_04]: Very interesting.

279
00:19:07,048 --> 00:19:10,290
[SPEAKER_04]: It seems like there's this huge still kind of question mark with the PlayStation 3.

280
00:19:10,670 --> 00:19:12,211
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, there's still a lot about it we don't know.

281
00:19:12,291 --> 00:19:14,532
[SPEAKER_04]: And spring is not that far away.

282
00:19:14,652 --> 00:19:17,494
[SPEAKER_04]: So it'll be interesting if this machine really does launch in the spring.

283
00:19:18,554 --> 00:19:20,675
[SPEAKER_04]: But, you know, I'd like to see it.

284
00:19:22,356 --> 00:19:22,816
[SPEAKER_04]: Be interesting.

285
00:19:23,537 --> 00:19:27,119
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's going to be sort of like I think the PS2 was.

286
00:19:29,008 --> 00:19:32,913
[SPEAKER_00]: Be released, be buggy as hell, be re-released.

287
00:19:33,113 --> 00:19:39,021
[SPEAKER_00]: Although amazingly enough, I actually have a very first model Japanese PS2 which has never had a problem.

288
00:19:39,853 --> 00:19:42,075
[SPEAKER_04]: You would think, too, that they learned from their previous mistakes.

289
00:19:42,415 --> 00:19:42,896
[SPEAKER_04]: You'd hope.

290
00:19:43,596 --> 00:19:46,819
[SPEAKER_04]: And that they're looking at what's going on with Microsoft and maybe saying, how can we prevent this?

291
00:19:46,959 --> 00:19:47,540
[SPEAKER_04]: At least I hope.

292
00:19:48,180 --> 00:19:49,141
[SPEAKER_04]: I hope everybody's looking at this.

293
00:19:49,341 --> 00:19:51,763
[SPEAKER_00]: Unless they put more work into it than they've been vocal about.

294
00:19:52,624 --> 00:19:52,984
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll see.

295
00:19:53,585 --> 00:20:00,190
[SPEAKER_04]: Speaking of 360, Loki, you had a story about basically Microsoft has come out and admitted why.

296
00:20:00,891 --> 00:20:04,474
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, the 360 supposedly is short, according to Microsoft, is because

297
00:20:05,123 --> 00:20:18,291
[SPEAKER_03]: of a shortage of chips, or a certain chip that was actually needed for the 360, and because the production of this chip is not quite at what they want, the 360s haven't been able to be made.

298
00:20:19,112 --> 00:20:24,675
[SPEAKER_03]: Basically, the yields are too low, and they're overrunning the supply of the systems.

299
00:20:26,856 --> 00:20:34,621
[SPEAKER_03]: And what they've said, though, is they're not going to be able to get back up to where they need to be until February.

300
00:20:36,311 --> 00:20:39,593
[SPEAKER_03]: Which is another reason why I bought my system when I could.

301
00:20:39,613 --> 00:20:42,515
[SPEAKER_04]: So basically if you don't have a pre-order, don't count on it until February.

302
00:20:43,076 --> 00:20:44,537
[SPEAKER_04]: Unless you're going to be camping out or something.

303
00:20:44,917 --> 00:20:46,398
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to be very hard to get one.

304
00:20:48,860 --> 00:20:53,843
[SPEAKER_04]: Speaking of the 360, their backwards compatibility has been upgraded a little bit.

305
00:20:53,903 --> 00:20:56,765
[SPEAKER_04]: They actually added support for a bunch of new games.

306
00:20:57,205 --> 00:20:59,126
[SPEAKER_04]: Except they all fall in the same family.

307
00:20:59,346 --> 00:21:10,970
[SPEAKER_04]: If you own any Tom Clancy game from the Xbox, pretty much, whether it be Ghost Recon 2, Summit Strike, Rainbow Six, Splinter Cell, it all now will work on your Xbox 360, thanks to backward compatibility.

308
00:21:11,010 --> 00:21:14,412
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, what's funny is when they initially released this, it broke Halo 2.

309
00:21:14,452 --> 00:21:18,233
[SPEAKER_03]: Then they had to recall the patch, and then they fixed it.

310
00:21:18,493 --> 00:21:19,354
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I didn't know about that.

311
00:21:19,574 --> 00:21:20,274
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that was funny.

312
00:21:20,494 --> 00:21:21,875
[SPEAKER_00]: We were playing Halo on our 360.

313
00:21:22,155 --> 00:21:24,136
[SPEAKER_00]: I was actually watching Dan play it.

314
00:21:24,176 --> 00:21:25,056
[SPEAKER_04]: Does it really look better?

315
00:21:26,662 --> 00:21:27,322
[SPEAKER_00]: Not noticeably.

316
00:21:28,183 --> 00:21:30,583
[SPEAKER_00]: A little cleaner.

317
00:21:32,164 --> 00:21:37,706
[SPEAKER_00]: We played it on the Xbox plenty of times that I'm pretty familiar with what it looks like on my TV.

318
00:21:38,506 --> 00:21:47,249
[SPEAKER_00]: And it did look a little more smooth, but it really wasn't a perceptible notice unless you were really looking for it.

319
00:21:49,326 --> 00:21:49,626
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

320
00:21:50,747 --> 00:21:57,931
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's go ahead and move on now and talk a little bit about real life because there is a big world out there outside of video games.

321
00:21:58,331 --> 00:22:05,495
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, if we stayed indoors and played video games all day long, we would have no time to go outside and whack people over the head with bug nets for real.

322
00:22:06,035 --> 00:22:11,918
[SPEAKER_04]: So DarkSakura is here to remind you that there is a big world out there, and she brings you her advice column.

323
00:22:12,619 --> 00:22:14,760
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, what are you going to be telling the kids about this week?

324
00:22:15,478 --> 00:22:18,961
[SPEAKER_00]: Today's bit of advice is how to survive if you're trapped in a walk-in freezer.

325
00:22:20,602 --> 00:22:22,663
[SPEAKER_04]: Wait, wasn't that an episode of Clerks, the cartoon?

326
00:22:22,843 --> 00:22:23,344
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, it was.

327
00:22:23,464 --> 00:22:23,984
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, awesome.

328
00:22:24,565 --> 00:22:28,928
[SPEAKER_00]: Where it had Dante wearing the diaper saying, I'm the biggest dumbass in the world.

329
00:22:31,049 --> 00:22:35,352
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, number one, tap several times on the door to get someone's attention.

330
00:22:36,153 --> 00:22:37,894
[SPEAKER_00]: Two, check the door and lock area.

331
00:22:41,091 --> 00:22:44,995
[SPEAKER_00]: By law, all walk-in freezers must have an emergency release switch on the interior.

332
00:22:46,136 --> 00:22:44,995
3.

333
00:22:46,536 --> 00:22:47,497
[SPEAKER_00]: Locate a power switch.

334
00:22:47,537 --> 00:22:49,639
[SPEAKER_00]: Some units may have an accessible on-off switch.

335
00:22:50,099 --> 00:22:51,380
[SPEAKER_00]: Turn off the cooling element.

336
00:22:52,401 --> 00:22:53,362
[SPEAKER_00]: That would be gross.

337
00:22:53,842 --> 00:22:55,203
[SPEAKER_00]: What if you're in there with meat?

338
00:22:56,565 --> 00:22:59,587
[SPEAKER_03]: Then turn it on every now and then to keep it nice and cool, but not too cold.

339
00:22:59,767 --> 00:23:00,948
[SPEAKER_04]: You'd come out smelling like meat.

340
00:23:01,549 --> 00:23:02,450
[SPEAKER_00]: Like rancid.

341
00:23:03,330 --> 00:23:02,450
4.

342
00:23:03,591 --> 00:23:04,511
[SPEAKER_00]: Locate boxes.

343
00:23:04,972 --> 00:23:07,234
[SPEAKER_00]: Tear cardboard boxes apart and spread them on the floor.

344
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:10,622
[SPEAKER_00]: 5.

345
00:23:08,981 --> 00:23:10,622
[SPEAKER_00]: Look for insulating materials.

346
00:23:10,702 --> 00:23:15,545
[SPEAKER_04]: Lie down on the cardboard and cover yourself with paper foam or straw to preserve vitality.

347
00:23:15,565 --> 00:23:15,545
6.

348
00:23:15,585 --> 00:23:17,627
[SPEAKER_03]: Tap on the door every 15 minutes until help arrives.

349
00:23:34,488 --> 00:23:38,249
[SPEAKER_00]: And actually in the little picture it shows somebody sitting there with an open container of ice cream and a spoon.

350
00:23:39,589 --> 00:23:45,730
[SPEAKER_00]: But my final piece of advice is, you know, just leave the door open.

351
00:23:47,151 --> 00:23:49,811
[SPEAKER_00]: When you're cleaning out your freezer at the 7-Eleven, just leave the door open.

352
00:23:50,711 --> 00:23:55,652
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you're in the freezer at the 7-Eleven, you could probably get out through where they have the drinks or something.

353
00:23:56,913 --> 00:23:58,273
[SPEAKER_00]: Do a swan dive through the eggs.

354
00:24:00,794 --> 00:24:01,174
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow.

355
00:24:01,294 --> 00:24:02,634
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, moving on.

356
00:24:04,090 --> 00:24:05,411
[SPEAKER_04]: We have a nice follow-up story.

357
00:24:05,431 --> 00:24:19,779
[SPEAKER_04]: You remember a couple weeks ago on the show here, we had Matt from the Save King's Quest 9 campaign was on the show to talk about how King's Quest 9 had a stop put to it by the man, basically, at Vivendi, and they were doing this huge letter-writing campaign to get it going again?

358
00:24:19,899 --> 00:24:20,519
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, guess what?

359
00:24:20,980 --> 00:24:21,200
[SPEAKER_04]: They...

360
00:24:21,940 --> 00:24:23,062
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for watching!

361
00:24:38,843 --> 00:24:42,066
[SPEAKER_04]: They will be releasing the game simply as a silver lining.

362
00:24:42,146 --> 00:24:44,848
[SPEAKER_04]: However, all the King's Quest characters get to stay intact.

363
00:24:45,348 --> 00:24:50,892
[SPEAKER_04]: Presumably the reason why Vivendi would be asking them to drop the name would be in case, you know, they see that this thing does really well.

364
00:24:50,932 --> 00:24:53,694
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe they'll want to go, maybe we really should put out a King's Quest.

365
00:24:53,734 --> 00:24:55,776
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe we made a bad decision.

366
00:24:56,116 --> 00:24:56,596
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, you did.

367
00:24:56,977 --> 00:24:59,038
[SPEAKER_04]: But, kind of cool.

368
00:24:59,098 --> 00:25:02,200
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, you kind of have to applaud Vivendi here.

369
00:25:02,261 --> 00:25:05,523
[SPEAKER_04]: They were, you know, looked at as the big evil man and here they are doing the,

370
00:25:06,175 --> 00:25:08,277
[SPEAKER_04]: Think if they really wanted to do the big thing, then hire them to make it.

371
00:25:21,292 --> 00:25:21,752
[SPEAKER_04]: You'd think so.

372
00:25:21,992 --> 00:25:25,574
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe it depends on how well this does, because it's supposedly going to be part of a trilogy.

373
00:25:25,875 --> 00:25:27,796
[SPEAKER_04]: This silver lining thing is all part of a trilogy.

374
00:25:27,816 --> 00:25:30,417
[SPEAKER_04]: They're going the whole nine yards with this thing.

375
00:25:30,817 --> 00:25:31,438
[SPEAKER_04]: No pun intended.

376
00:25:31,658 --> 00:25:32,158
[SPEAKER_01]: We shall see.

377
00:25:32,178 --> 00:25:32,618
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.

378
00:25:32,638 --> 00:25:33,159
[SPEAKER_04]: It'll be fun.

379
00:25:33,179 --> 00:25:33,739
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll download it.

380
00:25:33,759 --> 00:25:34,239
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll check it out.

381
00:25:34,819 --> 00:25:35,660
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope Rosella's in it.

382
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:39,322
[SPEAKER_00]: Instead of calling it King's Quest, it could be like King's Look Around.

383
00:25:40,202 --> 00:25:40,903
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

384
00:26:09,793 --> 00:26:12,734
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a little teaser trailer thing posted on the site.

385
00:26:13,415 --> 00:26:14,855
[SPEAKER_04]: It's very sexy, I gotta say.

386
00:26:14,935 --> 00:26:16,676
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just like trailers for the game.

387
00:26:17,076 --> 00:26:20,718
[SPEAKER_04]: And Pyramid Head you can see for like .5 seconds.

388
00:26:21,178 --> 00:26:23,319
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's very cool because they're advertising the movie like it's a game.

389
00:26:24,199 --> 00:26:25,339
[SPEAKER_04]: I gotta put this out there.

390
00:26:25,380 --> 00:26:26,600
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not a real trailer.

391
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:28,521
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the Flash animation from the site.

392
00:26:29,061 --> 00:26:33,163
[SPEAKER_04]: But presumably, if the real trailer looks like that, it's gonna be sexy.

393
00:26:33,922 --> 00:26:34,962
[SPEAKER_04]: We have high hopes for this game.

394
00:26:34,982 --> 00:26:35,682
[SPEAKER_04]: Do not disappoint us.

395
00:26:35,982 --> 00:26:38,043
[SPEAKER_04]: However, one minor disappointment this week.

396
00:26:38,163 --> 00:26:39,303
[SPEAKER_04]: I think this is a disappointment.

397
00:26:39,923 --> 00:26:45,184
[SPEAKER_04]: It was reported that Akira Yamaoka will not actually be doing the music for the Silent Hill movie.

398
00:26:45,244 --> 00:26:46,564
[SPEAKER_04]: He did the music for the games.

399
00:26:46,945 --> 00:26:48,305
[SPEAKER_04]: He will not be doing the music for the movie.

400
00:26:48,605 --> 00:26:52,526
[SPEAKER_04]: That honor will go to Jeff Dana, who did the music for Resident Evil Apocalypse.

401
00:26:52,986 --> 00:26:57,507
[SPEAKER_04]: However, he has said... I know Jamie wants to get something in there because she's mad.

402
00:26:58,047 --> 00:26:59,787
[SPEAKER_04]: However, I do want to say that he said...

403
00:27:00,007 --> 00:27:07,854
[SPEAKER_04]: The executive producer, Andrew Mason, said that Jeff Dana will be incorporating elements from the original game's score into the movie's score.

404
00:27:08,014 --> 00:27:08,815
[SPEAKER_04]: So at least you get that.

405
00:27:09,015 --> 00:27:09,776
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I was going to say.

406
00:27:10,276 --> 00:27:11,297
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, okay.

407
00:27:11,597 --> 00:27:15,020
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been, like, every day looking at Silent Hill stuff.

408
00:27:15,401 --> 00:27:19,484
[SPEAKER_04]: I would still at least like to see Akira get to do, like, a vocal song or something.

409
00:27:19,504 --> 00:27:22,247
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, because he did such great songs for the games that could have been...

410
00:27:23,237 --> 00:27:28,742
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think they would have ever been a runaway MTV hit, but I think they could have really appealed to the audience that would go see Silent Hill.

411
00:27:29,102 --> 00:27:34,387
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, the songs like You're Not Here from 3 and, you know, stuff from 4 like Room of Angel.

412
00:27:34,407 --> 00:27:38,091
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm really hoping this breaks the pattern of movie game.

413
00:27:38,111 --> 00:27:39,352
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope so too.

414
00:27:39,492 --> 00:27:42,375
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks pretty dead on so far.

415
00:27:42,955 --> 00:27:45,157
[SPEAKER_04]: If that Flash trailer is anything, that was...

416
00:27:46,676 --> 00:27:47,697
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly how it should be.

417
00:27:47,917 --> 00:27:48,437
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly.

418
00:27:50,038 --> 00:27:52,000
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd play it for you guys, but we're a radio show.

419
00:27:52,180 --> 00:27:53,601
[SPEAKER_04]: Just go to the site and check it out.

420
00:27:54,101 --> 00:27:58,965
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I actually don't have the link on me because it's on my home computer.

421
00:27:59,745 --> 00:28:08,031
[SPEAKER_00]: But I had seen a site that had a bit more information as far as the characters in it.

422
00:28:08,091 --> 00:28:13,015
[SPEAKER_00]: There are at least mentions to characters that are in...

423
00:28:14,488 --> 00:28:15,829
[SPEAKER_00]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

424
00:28:36,049 --> 00:28:37,610
[SPEAKER_04]: One other video game news thing though

425
00:29:03,421 --> 00:29:15,649
[SPEAKER_04]: Even when you consider that Doom did not do too hot at the box office, it made $49 million worldwide on a $60 million budget, they are going to do a return to Castle Wolfenstein movie.

426
00:29:15,689 --> 00:29:18,451
[SPEAKER_04]: At least that's what ID Software wants to do.

427
00:29:19,071 --> 00:29:29,758
[SPEAKER_04]: Nobody has, I don't think, bought this yet, but they want to do it, a movie for return to Castle Wolfenstein, which you might know is, in some ways, the predecessor to Doom is

428
00:29:31,081 --> 00:29:32,582
[SPEAKER_04]: If you go as far back as Wolfenstein 3D.

429
00:29:32,602 --> 00:29:34,583
[SPEAKER_03]: Just don't do the first person crap.

430
00:29:35,463 --> 00:29:35,984
[SPEAKER_04]: They better not.

431
00:29:38,125 --> 00:29:39,785
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually did find that information, by the way.

432
00:29:39,925 --> 00:29:40,146
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.

433
00:29:43,007 --> 00:29:44,628
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, I found it on Wikipedia.

434
00:29:44,668 --> 00:29:45,468
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where I had seen it.

435
00:29:45,969 --> 00:29:53,212
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a character in the movie called Christabella who, if I remember correctly, was also a character in the comic series.

436
00:29:54,173 --> 00:30:00,096
[SPEAKER_00]: Several of the people, the main character, Rose, her last name is Mason, which was Heather...

437
00:30:01,252 --> 00:30:07,341
[SPEAKER_00]: Cheryl Mason, and Harry Mason, and there's also a Sharon Mason in this.

438
00:30:08,503 --> 00:30:14,953
[SPEAKER_00]: And also, I think another character in here relates to another character that had been in Silent Hill 3.

439
00:30:15,356 --> 00:30:16,256
[SPEAKER_04]: Animal Crossing DS Animal Crossing DS

440
00:30:38,307 --> 00:30:38,867
[SPEAKER_04]: WTF?

441
00:30:39,068 --> 00:30:40,328
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I saw that last night.

442
00:30:41,229 --> 00:30:42,909
[SPEAKER_04]: I did not do the K.K.

443
00:30:42,950 --> 00:30:46,051
[SPEAKER_04]: Slider thing because he comes to your town, what, Saturday night?

444
00:30:46,131 --> 00:30:50,353
[SPEAKER_00]: Saturday night between 7.30 to 8 is his warm-up, 8 to midnight is the show.

445
00:30:50,533 --> 00:30:54,715
[SPEAKER_04]: I usually go out clubbing Saturday nights, but not last night.

446
00:30:54,735 --> 00:30:55,216
[SPEAKER_04]: I was coughing.

447
00:30:55,676 --> 00:30:56,896
[SPEAKER_04]: But anyway, no, this is interesting.

448
00:30:57,197 --> 00:30:58,017
[SPEAKER_04]: Part of what K.K.

449
00:30:58,037 --> 00:31:04,340
[SPEAKER_04]: Slider says in his little introduction, those industry fat cats try to put a price on my music, but it wants to be free.

450
00:31:05,361 --> 00:31:05,761
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

451
00:31:06,488 --> 00:31:08,449
[SPEAKER_04]: I think somebody might be taking that a little too far.

452
00:31:08,469 --> 00:31:13,032
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if I'd see that as a slam against the RIAA, but... That was the first impression I got.

453
00:31:13,092 --> 00:31:14,333
[SPEAKER_00]: He said a little bit more than that.

454
00:31:15,274 --> 00:31:15,614
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

455
00:31:15,674 --> 00:31:18,276
[SPEAKER_04]: I just kind of got the sense that it fits into his character.

456
00:31:18,296 --> 00:31:21,778
[SPEAKER_04]: Because, you know, he's supposed to be this wandering nomad guy that just plays tunes.

457
00:31:21,798 --> 00:31:25,660
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, he gives you bootleg copies of his songs, so... I don't know.

458
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:27,461
[SPEAKER_04]: I think people might be taking that a little far.

459
00:31:27,501 --> 00:31:27,882
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if...

460
00:31:28,542 --> 00:31:33,246
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it would not be in Nintendo's best interest to speak out against the RIAA, but who knows?

461
00:31:33,486 --> 00:31:39,210
[SPEAKER_00]: The bit if Nintendo was actually really worried about putting that impression, they would have phrased that line a little differently.

462
00:31:39,671 --> 00:31:40,311
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess you got a point.

463
00:31:40,992 --> 00:31:41,172
[SPEAKER_04]: True.

464
00:31:42,753 --> 00:31:51,040
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, I've got to ask about this, because we've been talking about a lot of new consoles here tonight, but I want to hear about an old console, and Loki, you have some pretty exciting news regarding an old console.

465
00:31:51,340 --> 00:31:57,485
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, Sega is apparently, well, it's a rumor, of course, but some German gaming site, Gamefront...

466
00:31:58,861 --> 00:32:02,822
[SPEAKER_03]: is claiming that they're going to be re-releasing the Dreamcast.

467
00:32:02,902 --> 00:32:07,564
[SPEAKER_03]: Basically it's bundled with some limited edition phone card or something.

468
00:32:08,484 --> 00:32:16,527
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's supposed to probably only be released in Japan and distributed through Sega Direct for about $83 US or 10,000 yen.

469
00:32:16,627 --> 00:32:21,768
[SPEAKER_04]: Or you could just go to GameStop and get a used one for like 30 bucks.

470
00:32:22,588 --> 00:32:23,529
[SPEAKER_04]: However much they're running.

471
00:32:24,449 --> 00:32:25,849
[SPEAKER_04]: I know, it's still a neat idea.

472
00:32:26,590 --> 00:32:27,730
[SPEAKER_00]: I still play my Dreamcast.

473
00:32:28,243 --> 00:32:29,084
[SPEAKER_04]: Dead or Alive 4 Dead or Alive 4

474
00:32:56,823 --> 00:32:57,984
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

475
00:33:20,819 --> 00:33:22,060
[SPEAKER_04]: Other than that, normal consoles, we have 25 to Life,

476
00:33:48,184 --> 00:33:54,146
[SPEAKER_03]: Final Fantasy IV Advance on the 13th.

477
00:33:54,166 --> 00:33:55,147
[SPEAKER_04]: I found that one out.

478
00:33:56,387 --> 00:33:56,807
[SPEAKER_04]: The hard way.

479
00:33:57,528 --> 00:33:59,308
[SPEAKER_03]: Final Fantasy IV on the 13th of January?

480
00:33:59,748 --> 00:34:00,349
[SPEAKER_04]: No, of December.

481
00:34:00,789 --> 00:34:01,089
[SPEAKER_04]: This week.

482
00:34:01,549 --> 00:34:02,889
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, yes, that's this week.

483
00:34:03,550 --> 00:34:09,772
[SPEAKER_03]: And then, of course, True Swing Golf, if you're a golf fan for the DS, that's pretty good.

484
00:34:11,348 --> 00:34:13,289
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

485
00:34:40,529 --> 00:34:42,830
[SPEAKER_00]: Bioshock, Call of Cthulhu, Dead to Rights.

486
00:34:44,350 --> 00:34:45,810
[SPEAKER_00]: A few titles along those lines.

487
00:34:45,951 --> 00:34:54,593
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, just out of this morbid curiosity, do they have to alter Madden NFL when they release it in Britain because football is not football there?

488
00:34:54,853 --> 00:34:57,654
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, as far as I was aware, it's just called American football.

489
00:34:58,754 --> 00:35:01,375
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if that means they've got to recode stuff in the game or whatever.

490
00:35:01,395 --> 00:35:04,896
[SPEAKER_03]: No, it's just called NFL, so it would be the National Football League.

491
00:35:05,176 --> 00:35:06,856
[SPEAKER_04]: Just curious, just one of my curiosity things.

492
00:35:07,016 --> 00:35:08,717
[SPEAKER_03]: I was going to mention one thing since we're talking about the UK.

493
00:35:10,189 --> 00:35:14,773
[SPEAKER_03]: The official Xbox 360 magazine is going to be on the January issue.

494
00:35:14,793 --> 00:35:19,076
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to have a disc to be able to play the Final Fantasy XI beta on the 360.

495
00:35:20,197 --> 00:35:21,077
[SPEAKER_04]: Here or in the UK?

496
00:35:21,338 --> 00:35:21,918
[SPEAKER_03]: I think in the UK.

497
00:35:21,938 --> 00:35:24,100
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not sure about here, but maybe.

498
00:35:25,160 --> 00:35:26,001
[SPEAKER_03]: So check that out.

499
00:35:27,022 --> 00:35:29,163
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, lucky you guys if you guys get that and America doesn't.

500
00:35:29,924 --> 00:35:35,408
[SPEAKER_00]: Another actually interesting game on here is Shin Megami Tensei, which we actually got over here.

501
00:35:35,628 --> 00:35:36,609
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, digital double-sided.

502
00:35:37,659 --> 00:35:40,239
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, actually, we didn't get a number of...

503
00:36:05,660 --> 00:36:06,601
[SPEAKER_00]: Listen up, this is great.

504
00:36:06,661 --> 00:36:07,341
[SPEAKER_00]: Listen to this.

505
00:36:07,381 --> 00:36:07,961
[SPEAKER_00]: By Gareth.

506
00:36:34,839 --> 00:36:37,620
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey guys, was listening to your show on the way to work today.

507
00:36:38,140 --> 00:36:39,981
[SPEAKER_00]: I live just outside London, UK by the way.

508
00:36:40,081 --> 00:36:46,963
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a 2.75 year old daughter, which piqued my interest in your chat about parents' responsibility with their kids.

509
00:36:47,423 --> 00:36:55,765
[SPEAKER_00]: So my daughter and I play games together, mostly things like Trackmania Sunrise, she likes painting the cars, to Incredibles to Super Mario Sunshine.

510
00:36:56,266 --> 00:37:00,747
[SPEAKER_00]: She also has some kids games like Dora the Explorer along with some web games on the BBC.

511
00:37:01,727 --> 00:37:03,728
[SPEAKER_00]: So my point, I was surprised at two things.

512
00:37:04,268 --> 00:37:07,150
[SPEAKER_00]: One, it is hard to get games that don't feature some sort of violence.

513
00:37:07,230 --> 00:37:10,571
[SPEAKER_00]: We are by nature a society that violence has a part of it.

514
00:37:11,612 --> 00:37:17,735
[SPEAKER_00]: Two, she was very quick to pick up on the violent parts of games and knows when she is hitting someone or something.

515
00:37:18,075 --> 00:37:21,237
[SPEAKER_00]: She even vocalizes it by saying hit or shoot when she does this.

516
00:37:21,837 --> 00:37:24,598
[SPEAKER_00]: After being a bit worried about this, I thought this is not a problem.

517
00:37:24,938 --> 00:37:30,281
[SPEAKER_00]: She has parents who monitor and guide her behavior and we have not seen her try to replicate the violence she has seen on the game so far.

518
00:37:31,144 --> 00:37:40,268
[SPEAKER_00]: I know from my experience as a long-time gamer and now a parent, that is my parents' guidance and active parenting that made the biggest difference to me being well-adjusted.

519
00:37:40,328 --> 00:37:41,128
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, some think so.

520
00:37:42,128 --> 00:37:49,551
[SPEAKER_00]: You won't be able to change your kids' environments and their exposure to violence that easily, but you definitely can be a big influence in how they react and live with it.

521
00:37:49,711 --> 00:37:54,433
[SPEAKER_00]: And I thought that last phrase right there was the best way anyone could ever say it.

522
00:37:54,513 --> 00:37:56,054
[SPEAKER_00]: You have major kudos from me.

523
00:37:56,772 --> 00:37:57,413
[SPEAKER_04]: Beautifully put.

524
00:37:58,734 --> 00:37:59,134
[SPEAKER_04]: That's right.

525
00:37:59,354 --> 00:38:00,476
[SPEAKER_04]: Can you get it through one more email?

526
00:38:00,816 --> 00:38:01,797
[SPEAKER_00]: I can get through a couple.

527
00:38:02,057 --> 00:38:03,118
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, cool.

528
00:38:04,639 --> 00:38:09,384
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, got an email from Deekman, one of our Australian listeners.

529
00:38:09,404 --> 00:38:11,106
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

530
00:38:11,566 --> 00:38:13,988
[SPEAKER_00]: Talking about the 50 Cent game.

531
00:38:14,449 --> 00:38:14,749
[SPEAKER_00]: 50 Cent.

532
00:38:15,009 --> 00:38:15,590
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, God.

533
00:38:16,631 --> 00:38:17,131
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, my God.

534
00:38:17,171 --> 00:38:18,513
[SPEAKER_04]: I watched like five minutes of the...

535
00:38:19,827 --> 00:38:31,241
[SPEAKER_04]: The BikeTV Video Game Awards, and I saw a little bit of that 50 Cent game, and I was just like, this is so not the type of game that appeals to me in any way, shape, or form.

536
00:38:31,681 --> 00:38:37,268
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you said the 50 Cent game had been banned in Australia for drug use and excessive violence.

537
00:38:37,448 --> 00:38:38,950
[SPEAKER_03]: And for sucking really bad.

538
00:38:39,602 --> 00:38:40,082
[SPEAKER_00]: DarkSakura.com

539
00:38:53,260 --> 00:38:54,561
[SPEAKER_03]: Horrible reviews.

540
00:38:54,901 --> 00:38:56,042
[SPEAKER_03]: Horrible reviews.

541
00:38:56,182 --> 00:38:56,642
[SPEAKER_04]: Really?

542
00:38:57,583 --> 00:38:58,203
[SPEAKER_04]: That's too bad.

543
00:38:59,104 --> 00:39:06,269
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, as I was reading, to quote, down here if a game gets an R rating, it literally can't be sold in stores.

544
00:39:06,349 --> 00:39:13,414
[SPEAKER_00]: Other titles include the original GTA 3 game where you could pick up hookers and screw them to get back life, which was edited out and re-released, and Manhunt.

545
00:39:14,294 --> 00:39:19,738
[SPEAKER_00]: In cases like this, you guys are lucky that your stuff only gets censored as much as they do and not completely banned from stores like our stuff.

546
00:39:21,010 --> 00:39:26,774
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, and he also mentioned that Acclaim is bankrupt and now selling off rights to games so we could get the rights to Busted Move if we wanted it.

547
00:39:27,374 --> 00:39:28,135
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yeah, that's right.

548
00:39:28,455 --> 00:39:31,657
[SPEAKER_04]: I did a story on my live show on the station this week about that.

549
00:39:31,677 --> 00:39:40,483
[SPEAKER_04]: That's kind of interesting, and I thought it was interesting because only one of the Mary Kay and Ashley Wilson games is being bought, sought after, out of the, like, 50 that were available.

550
00:39:41,123 --> 00:39:44,826
[SPEAKER_00]: There was another point made by one of our listeners in Scotland.

551
00:39:45,558 --> 00:39:47,961
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been getting a lot of overseas writing these days.

552
00:39:47,981 --> 00:39:48,842
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's pretty cool.

553
00:39:48,922 --> 00:39:49,984
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that's neat.

554
00:39:50,104 --> 00:39:50,965
[SPEAKER_00]: From Sloan.

555
00:39:53,588 --> 00:39:55,571
[SPEAKER_00]: Said he's got three kids, 33, and...

556
00:40:04,588 --> 00:40:07,329
[SPEAKER_00]: Part of the course is to discover your market when designing a game.

557
00:40:07,349 --> 00:40:11,472
[SPEAKER_00]: You come up with an overall concept and test the market to see who your primary persona is.

558
00:40:12,012 --> 00:40:21,298
[SPEAKER_00]: They mentioned a site that's DESA.com, the Entertainment Software Association, that has a report called Essential Facts About the Computer and Video Game Industry.

559
00:40:22,139 --> 00:40:24,220
[SPEAKER_00]: It says it has some interesting statistics.

560
00:40:26,481 --> 00:40:27,682
[SPEAKER_00]: for statistics.

561
00:40:28,523 --> 00:40:31,144
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, the average age of a game buyer is 37.

562
00:40:32,805 --> 00:40:37,769
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's really the parents that are buying the games, the older sibling buying the games.

563
00:40:38,469 --> 00:40:42,011
[SPEAKER_00]: And most of the time, it's the kid saying, hey, I want this game.

564
00:40:42,131 --> 00:40:44,133
[SPEAKER_00]: Or the parent saying, hey, kid, do you want this game?

565
00:40:44,173 --> 00:40:47,055
[SPEAKER_00]: And the kid going, sure, I'd like the suffering.

566
00:40:49,156 --> 00:40:52,138
[SPEAKER_00]: And yes, I've actually seen this happen just recently.

567
00:40:53,084 --> 00:40:55,086
[SPEAKER_00]: at one of our local video game stores.

568
00:40:55,186 --> 00:40:56,347
[SPEAKER_00]: So I know very well.

569
00:40:56,827 --> 00:41:00,790
[SPEAKER_00]: But to quote, I'm going to read this one's paragraph here I think is very important.

570
00:41:01,250 --> 00:41:02,612
[SPEAKER_00]: Parents need to be educated.

571
00:41:02,672 --> 00:41:08,096
[SPEAKER_00]: You wouldn't take your kid to an 18 certificate movie or would you?

572
00:41:08,416 --> 00:41:14,741
[SPEAKER_00]: My son, the 11 year old, has a friend whose parents regularly let him watch horror movies and play video games such as GTA and Doom 3.

573
00:41:15,442 --> 00:41:17,163
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lack of parental instruction here.

574
00:41:18,374 --> 00:41:27,523
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got what my children see when they are in my sight, but what are the other parents exposing my child to when they visit their friends' friends?

575
00:41:28,724 --> 00:41:36,151
[SPEAKER_00]: And he also goes on further and says, by age he means the kid is mature enough when you're 11 you laugh at dick and fart jokes and naked women, but that's not particularly mature.

576
00:41:36,392 --> 00:41:37,112
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm still doing that at 27.

577
00:41:37,192 --> 00:41:37,673
[SPEAKER_04]: We still tell them.

578
00:41:41,756 --> 00:41:44,997
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, I thought this was pretty smart.

579
00:41:45,457 --> 00:41:48,438
[SPEAKER_00]: Make the law similar to DVD video and liquor sales.

580
00:41:48,498 --> 00:41:51,899
[SPEAKER_00]: If you supply to an underage person, you can be prosecuted.

581
00:41:52,239 --> 00:41:53,499
[SPEAKER_00]: Parents know your ratings.

582
00:41:53,579 --> 00:41:57,620
[SPEAKER_00]: They are not difficult, and I agree with Rob that ratings should be the same as movies.

583
00:41:57,660 --> 00:42:06,643
[SPEAKER_00]: GTA series are rated by the BBFC as an 18, same as violent movie out here over here in the U.K.,

584
00:42:07,233 --> 00:42:09,858
[SPEAKER_00]: He also mentions to Matt, you two are quite correct.

585
00:42:09,898 --> 00:42:11,121
[SPEAKER_00]: Parents should do their own homework.

586
00:42:11,461 --> 00:42:13,846
[SPEAKER_00]: Who's responsible for a kid when they're out in the street playing?

587
00:42:14,087 --> 00:42:17,193
[SPEAKER_00]: It's no longer acceptable to say, it's okay, he's upstairs playing on his computer.

588
00:42:17,513 --> 00:42:18,856
[SPEAKER_00]: Look what happened to Matthew Broderick.

589
00:42:22,415 --> 00:42:23,396
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a good reference.

590
00:42:24,437 --> 00:42:25,699
[SPEAKER_00]: Would you like to play a game?

591
00:42:25,899 --> 00:42:27,300
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm thrilled that someone agrees with me.

592
00:42:27,340 --> 00:42:30,724
[SPEAKER_04]: That makes 50 episodes of doing this crap so worth it that somebody agrees with me.

593
00:42:31,625 --> 00:42:34,348
[SPEAKER_00]: My last thing on this.

594
00:42:34,408 --> 00:42:38,112
[SPEAKER_00]: I leave you with a quote from a congressional hearing chaired by Joe Lieberman.

595
00:42:38,432 --> 00:42:39,474
[SPEAKER_00]: This was a few years ago.

596
00:42:40,475 --> 00:42:42,497
[SPEAKER_00]: It was nice to see he still hates video games.

597
00:42:43,123 --> 00:42:47,028
[SPEAKER_00]: This quote is from Marilyn Droz, the VP of National Coalition of Television Violence.

598
00:42:47,048 --> 00:42:48,089
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what she had to say.

599
00:42:48,790 --> 00:43:02,686
[SPEAKER_00]: If the Pentagon was to ever have suggested years ago that we put video games that teach children how to aim guns and train them at the age of eight to be soldiers and ever invented a game to put in the homes of young boys to train them to be in the military, I can't begin to tell you...

600
00:43:03,647 --> 00:43:08,049
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what kind of uproar there would be in this country if our government was to start training early killers.

601
00:43:10,530 --> 00:43:12,430
[SPEAKER_00]: You mentioned on there America's Army.

602
00:43:12,490 --> 00:43:14,611
[SPEAKER_04]: Isn't that what America's Army does?

603
00:43:14,971 --> 00:43:17,292
[SPEAKER_00]: She was talking about the Nintendo Super Scope.

604
00:43:20,953 --> 00:43:22,894
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought that was such a wonderful point.

605
00:43:23,154 --> 00:43:25,815
[SPEAKER_04]: The Nintendo Super Scope was nothing.

606
00:43:26,508 --> 00:43:28,349
[SPEAKER_00]: I know, I was playing Blastress.

607
00:43:28,630 --> 00:43:29,971
[SPEAKER_04]: I know, and the mole game.

608
00:43:30,171 --> 00:43:30,651
[SPEAKER_04]: Come on.

609
00:43:30,671 --> 00:43:31,712
[SPEAKER_00]: This mole game was stupid.

610
00:43:32,112 --> 00:43:33,013
[SPEAKER_00]: But... Hey.

611
00:43:33,653 --> 00:43:42,019
[SPEAKER_00]: But I would, honestly, I would really, for those last two letters, I would really love to have our writers' permission to post those on our site, really.

612
00:43:42,039 --> 00:43:42,379
[SPEAKER_00]: Great.

613
00:43:42,419 --> 00:43:47,283
[SPEAKER_00]: Because those are the most well-thought-out things I have read in the past couple weeks.

614
00:43:48,123 --> 00:43:48,404
[SPEAKER_04]: Awesome.

615
00:43:48,424 --> 00:43:52,606
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, if you guys want to send us an email, togo, T-O-G-O, at orangeloungeradio.com.

616
00:43:52,647 --> 00:43:54,468
[SPEAKER_04]: Any last little bits you want to read?

617
00:43:54,488 --> 00:43:55,228
[SPEAKER_04]: Anything?

618
00:43:55,929 --> 00:43:56,009
[SPEAKER_00]: Um...

619
00:43:58,204 --> 00:44:00,467
[SPEAKER_00]: I've gotten several emails along the same lines.

620
00:44:02,009 --> 00:44:09,238
[SPEAKER_00]: One of our friends, our listeners, John wrote in, basically saying more of the same.

621
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:14,385
[SPEAKER_00]: I especially like the point saying is that, you know,

622
00:44:15,888 --> 00:44:26,472
[SPEAKER_00]: No matter if you're into the violent games, listen to emo music or horror movies, you can still be a peaceful person.

623
00:44:28,393 --> 00:44:30,074
[SPEAKER_00]: I really liked that one point there.

624
00:44:30,434 --> 00:44:32,975
[SPEAKER_04]: Saying emo reminds me of this simple fact.

625
00:44:32,995 --> 00:44:35,036
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you know what is ten times worse than video games?

626
00:44:35,496 --> 00:44:35,736
[SPEAKER_00]: Emo?

627
00:44:35,996 --> 00:44:37,037
[SPEAKER_04]: No, Myspace.

628
00:44:38,436 --> 00:44:41,099
[SPEAKER_04]: I swear to God, Myspace is worse than any video game I've ever seen.

629
00:44:41,560 --> 00:44:46,566
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, really, and... Every kid has a profile on Myspace, it's sad.

630
00:44:46,909 --> 00:44:49,709
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I thought it was funny that he did actually mirror something that you said.

631
00:44:50,030 --> 00:44:51,950
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll just quote this last and that's the end of the mailbox.

632
00:44:52,010 --> 00:44:52,270
[SPEAKER_00]: Alrighty.

633
00:44:52,290 --> 00:44:53,570
[SPEAKER_00]: Because we got a lot of mail this time around.

634
00:44:53,590 --> 00:44:53,810
[SPEAKER_00]: I know.

635
00:44:54,130 --> 00:44:55,470
[SPEAKER_00]: This law is not a ban.

636
00:44:55,530 --> 00:44:59,011
[SPEAKER_00]: It's simply a way to prevent kids from buying games that their parents might not approve of.

637
00:44:59,691 --> 00:45:02,772
[SPEAKER_00]: Honest, caring, and hardworking parents work until 5 or 6 p.m.

638
00:45:03,192 --> 00:45:06,952
[SPEAKER_00]: With their child at home, they can't prevent them from going to the store and buying a GTA-type game.

639
00:45:07,993 --> 00:45:08,273
[SPEAKER_01]: True.

640
00:45:08,653 --> 00:45:08,853
[SPEAKER_01]: True.

641
00:45:09,073 --> 00:45:12,273
[SPEAKER_00]: And on that respect, I do support that aspect of it.

642
00:45:12,293 --> 00:45:13,813
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I said as much last week.

643
00:45:14,454 --> 00:45:16,674
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just that I still think that

644
00:45:19,511 --> 00:45:29,919
[SPEAKER_00]: It is really difficult, I think, on parents to have that kind of active stance in their children's lives, but I still think that if they weren't ready for the responsibility, they shouldn't have had the children to begin with.

645
00:45:31,220 --> 00:45:31,460
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

646
00:45:31,661 --> 00:45:35,463
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, we look forward to getting your more emails to go at originalsradio.com.

647
00:45:35,503 --> 00:45:36,624
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's get back into some news.

648
00:45:37,765 --> 00:45:43,049
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, Loki, I brought up the Video Game Awards on Spike TV there a little bit, and I know you caught a little glimpse of it.

649
00:45:43,370 --> 00:45:44,711
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you watch the whole damn thing, or what happened?

650
00:45:44,811 --> 00:45:47,673
[SPEAKER_03]: I watched the after show, and

651
00:45:48,280 --> 00:45:49,961
[SPEAKER_03]: I think this is the way video game award shows should be.

652
00:45:49,981 --> 00:45:50,301
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, this is

653
00:46:17,978 --> 00:46:18,778
[SPEAKER_03]: It was really good actually.

654
00:46:18,958 --> 00:46:19,898
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a very good show.

655
00:46:20,198 --> 00:46:22,319
[SPEAKER_03]: Definitely a whole lot better than G4ia.

656
00:46:23,759 --> 00:46:27,300
[SPEAKER_03]: What they started off with is Samuel L. Jackson because he was hosting the whole thing.

657
00:46:27,340 --> 00:46:28,980
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean that's good just from the start.

658
00:46:29,400 --> 00:46:34,982
[SPEAKER_03]: He was playing the part of, and I haven't played this far into the Warriors or haven't seen the movie yet.

659
00:46:35,062 --> 00:46:38,562
[SPEAKER_03]: The main character in the Warriors, you know the guy in the beginning like, can you dig it?

660
00:46:38,942 --> 00:46:41,703
[SPEAKER_03]: But they had all the video game characters in the audience and the crowd.

661
00:46:42,082 --> 00:46:45,104
[SPEAKER_03]: And the best part about the whole thing is you see the Katamari rolling around.

662
00:46:45,625 --> 00:46:48,147
[SPEAKER_03]: It's picking up people as it's going along and stuff.

663
00:46:48,187 --> 00:46:49,288
[SPEAKER_03]: And that was the greatest thing ever.

664
00:46:49,848 --> 00:46:55,172
[SPEAKER_03]: And then Tack from Tack 3 or whatever he's called.

665
00:46:55,232 --> 00:46:56,954
[SPEAKER_03]: He's all, Warriors!

666
00:46:57,154 --> 00:46:58,455
[SPEAKER_03]: Come out and play!

667
00:46:58,595 --> 00:47:01,577
[SPEAKER_03]: And he shoots Samuel L. Jackson.

668
00:47:01,597 --> 00:47:03,238
[SPEAKER_03]: And I thought that was great.

669
00:47:03,319 --> 00:47:04,379
[SPEAKER_03]: It was really funny.

670
00:47:05,820 --> 00:47:08,703
[SPEAKER_03]: They put a whole MTV Music Awards spin on it.

671
00:47:08,763 --> 00:47:10,204
[SPEAKER_03]: And I really liked the way they did that.

672
00:47:10,512 --> 00:47:11,513
[SPEAKER_04]: I watched about five minutes.

673
00:47:11,534 --> 00:47:12,295
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought it was stupid.

674
00:47:12,615 --> 00:47:12,915
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry.

675
00:47:13,917 --> 00:47:19,825
[SPEAKER_03]: The music part was stupid, but I did like the fact that they were doing this kind of fun little twist on it and stuff.

676
00:47:20,486 --> 00:47:24,572
[SPEAKER_03]: However, though, they are still... Being that there's only really two award shows out there, they are still...

677
00:47:25,154 --> 00:47:26,495
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, highly superior to G4U.

678
00:47:27,395 --> 00:47:27,756
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll see.

679
00:47:29,096 --> 00:47:31,958
[SPEAKER_04]: Jamie, I'm curious if you heard about this because I'm sure you've got to have an opinion on this.

680
00:47:32,278 --> 00:47:34,159
[SPEAKER_04]: Talk about the wrong way to hold a protest.

681
00:47:34,199 --> 00:47:35,180
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you hear about this kid?

682
00:47:35,460 --> 00:47:45,326
[SPEAKER_04]: It was like some 16-year-old kid got basically arrested, or charged anyway, by threatening the one and only Jack Thompson with torture and death.

683
00:47:46,947 --> 00:47:51,269
[SPEAKER_04]: He basically, I don't know, sent this thing that said all these nasty things he was going to do to Jack Thompson.

684
00:47:51,329 --> 00:47:52,150
[SPEAKER_04]: It's kind of one of those, like,

685
00:47:52,748 --> 00:47:53,228
[SPEAKER_04]: Jack Thompson

686
00:48:22,469 --> 00:48:31,472
[SPEAKER_04]: I know, and I feel bad because now I'm contributing to this, but I'm only reporting what's out there on the internet, because half the gaming sites out there also report this.

687
00:48:31,552 --> 00:48:35,773
[SPEAKER_04]: It's kind of like... I thought we were bad attention whores.

688
00:48:37,414 --> 00:48:39,134
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, we don't get death threats often.

689
00:48:43,018 --> 00:48:44,159
[SPEAKER_00]: and I'm tired of talking about him

690
00:49:05,712 --> 00:49:13,477
[SPEAKER_00]: I am not saying that I am going to inject him with cancerous cells so that he dies of liver cancer, but if he does I'd like to report it.

691
00:49:17,660 --> 00:49:20,022
[SPEAKER_04]: Swiftly changing the subject over to Castlevania.

692
00:49:20,082 --> 00:49:21,403
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's talk about Castlevania.

693
00:49:22,684 --> 00:49:24,045
[SPEAKER_04]: I think this is kind of interesting.

694
00:49:24,966 --> 00:49:31,451
[SPEAKER_04]: Konami, for no real reason, is going to be packaging Aria of Sorrow and Harmony of Dissonance together into one game.

695
00:49:31,852 --> 00:49:33,253
[SPEAKER_04]: And that will be coming out the first quarter of 2006.

696
00:49:33,633 --> 00:49:36,636
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's no real reason why they're doing it.

697
00:49:36,776 --> 00:49:38,397
[SPEAKER_04]: They're not really adding anything to these games.

698
00:49:38,958 --> 00:49:44,723
[SPEAKER_04]: I think they're doing this because DS is selling so freaking huge, and so they want to capitalize on that.

699
00:49:44,743 --> 00:49:45,904
[SPEAKER_03]: They buy little stuff all the time.

700
00:49:47,145 --> 00:49:48,906
[SPEAKER_00]: Pretty game, pretty.

701
00:49:48,926 --> 00:49:52,249
[SPEAKER_04]: Those two would still sell separately on their own, except I don't think they make either one anymore.

702
00:49:52,269 --> 00:49:53,390
[SPEAKER_00]: If I didn't already have them, I'd buy them.

703
00:49:54,167 --> 00:49:55,207
[SPEAKER_04]: I know, that's kind of how I feel.

704
00:49:56,047 --> 00:50:00,649
[SPEAKER_04]: Jamie, you have a story about another racing game.

705
00:50:00,669 --> 00:50:04,729
[SPEAKER_04]: We've been talking about Project Gotham and all this other stuff, but you have a racing game that sounds pretty hot.

706
00:50:04,990 --> 00:50:05,370
[SPEAKER_00]: No, no, no.

707
00:50:05,430 --> 00:50:07,910
[SPEAKER_00]: Best racing game series ever.

708
00:50:08,190 --> 00:50:08,810
[SPEAKER_00]: Outrun.

709
00:50:09,051 --> 00:50:09,631
[SPEAKER_00]: Woo-hoo.

710
00:50:10,871 --> 00:50:15,192
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, at my house, you've seen at my house, classic Sega Horror House.

711
00:50:16,072 --> 00:50:17,172
[SPEAKER_00]: That didn't sound too right.

712
00:50:17,372 --> 00:50:19,493
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, I digress.

713
00:50:20,385 --> 00:50:24,093
[SPEAKER_00]: SIGA's announced OutRun 2006 and we all cheer yay!

714
00:50:24,273 --> 00:50:24,714
[SPEAKER_00]: Yay!

715
00:50:29,541 --> 00:50:37,846
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, Sega's confirmed Outrun 2006 Coast to Coast will be released March 2006 on the PS2, PSP, and PC.

716
00:50:37,906 --> 00:50:38,526
[SPEAKER_00]: But guess what?

717
00:50:38,587 --> 00:50:39,747
[SPEAKER_00]: Not on... Arcade.

718
00:50:40,148 --> 00:50:40,608
[SPEAKER_00]: Xbox.

719
00:50:41,689 --> 00:50:42,329
[SPEAKER_04]: And no arcade.

720
00:50:43,310 --> 00:50:49,694
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't see... It's going to be 30 stages, the best of both Outrun 2 and Outrun 2 SP.

721
00:50:50,815 --> 00:50:53,796
[SPEAKER_00]: Mission structure, licensed mode, 6 player online.

722
00:50:54,237 --> 00:50:55,998
[SPEAKER_00]: Total of 12 licensed Ferraris.

723
00:50:56,892 --> 00:50:59,453
[SPEAKER_00]: including the F430 and Super America.

724
00:50:59,493 --> 00:51:01,474
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, you said something about Outrun 2 and previous Outruns.

725
00:51:01,514 --> 00:51:03,615
[SPEAKER_04]: They're not just repackaging the same crap, right?

726
00:51:03,635 --> 00:51:05,356
[SPEAKER_04]: They're gonna give it a facelift and everything.

727
00:51:05,516 --> 00:51:06,797
[SPEAKER_04]: Bring it to the next gen, right?

728
00:51:07,197 --> 00:51:08,138
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what it sounds like.

729
00:51:08,158 --> 00:51:08,858
[SPEAKER_04]: They're effing better.

730
00:51:09,538 --> 00:51:18,423
[SPEAKER_00]: Um... Also, it says PSP owners who also have the PS2 version will be able to access exclusive content by hooking them up.

731
00:51:19,203 --> 00:51:19,543
[SPEAKER_03]: Ooh!

732
00:51:19,704 --> 00:51:20,964
[SPEAKER_00]: With the USB cable.

733
00:51:21,364 --> 00:51:22,185
[SPEAKER_00]: Finally a use!

734
00:51:23,045 --> 00:51:24,846
[SPEAKER_03]: They actually do that with a lot of games.

735
00:51:25,627 --> 00:51:26,187
[SPEAKER_00]: Do they?

736
00:51:26,247 --> 00:51:26,407
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

737
00:51:26,812 --> 00:51:30,595
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, at any rate, it's being put out in development by Sumo Digital.

738
00:51:31,015 --> 00:51:33,577
[SPEAKER_00]: They actually were the ones who ported Outrun 2 to Xbox.

739
00:51:34,058 --> 00:51:39,822
[SPEAKER_03]: Like WWE, SmackDown vs. Raw 6, SOCOM, Fireteam Bravo, and SOCOM 3.

740
00:51:43,745 --> 00:51:44,105
[SPEAKER_03]: Madden.

741
00:51:46,887 --> 00:51:48,408
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, Loki, I'm about out of stuff.

742
00:51:48,428 --> 00:51:49,449
[SPEAKER_04]: What else you got for us tonight?

743
00:51:49,869 --> 00:51:52,732
[SPEAKER_04]: I know you had something on Metal Gear or something and a pretty cool hack.

744
00:51:53,872 --> 00:51:54,373
[SPEAKER_03]: Metal Gear?

745
00:51:54,946 --> 00:51:57,288
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you say you had something about Metal Gear Acid 2 or something?

746
00:51:57,508 --> 00:51:58,148
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, no.

747
00:51:58,188 --> 00:51:59,169
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, Metal Gear Acid 2.

748
00:52:00,230 --> 00:52:01,250
[SPEAKER_03]: It's actually quite funny.

749
00:52:01,430 --> 00:52:06,494
[SPEAKER_03]: They found out one of the things that's actually featured in the game because someone, of course, dumped the ROM for it.

750
00:52:07,314 --> 00:52:09,856
[SPEAKER_03]: And they discovered videos of... Wait, is the game out?

751
00:52:10,256 --> 00:52:11,177
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, in Japan.

752
00:52:11,497 --> 00:52:11,878
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, okay.

753
00:52:12,518 --> 00:52:19,102
[SPEAKER_03]: Of scantily clad women for use with that special viewing device that they have, the solid eye.

754
00:52:19,923 --> 00:52:23,345
[SPEAKER_03]: So you get 3D video of scantily clad women as well as...

755
00:52:25,273 --> 00:52:27,414
[SPEAKER_03]: A trailer for Rainbow Roses XX, which is kind of cool.

756
00:52:27,614 --> 00:52:27,874
[SPEAKER_03]: Hot.

757
00:52:29,214 --> 00:52:35,497
[SPEAKER_03]: In other news, this is called, you know, it's bound to happen sooner or later.

758
00:52:35,597 --> 00:52:39,918
[SPEAKER_03]: The first 360 game has been dumped to a hard drive.

759
00:52:40,918 --> 00:52:46,200
[SPEAKER_03]: A group going by the name of Pi has released a 360 dump extract tool.

760
00:52:46,220 --> 00:52:50,742
[SPEAKER_03]: They were able to rip apart the games to extract them to their PC's hard drive.

761
00:52:51,682 --> 00:52:53,583
[SPEAKER_03]: Getting the run on the other hand, that's another story.

762
00:52:53,663 --> 00:52:54,123
[SPEAKER_03]: But still...

763
00:52:55,652 --> 00:52:57,252
[SPEAKER_04]: One small step for hackers.

764
00:52:57,853 --> 00:52:58,093
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

765
00:52:59,473 --> 00:53:00,533
[SPEAKER_04]: One giant... forget it.

766
00:53:01,453 --> 00:53:01,754
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyways.

767
00:53:03,254 --> 00:53:04,114
[SPEAKER_03]: So that was interesting.

768
00:53:04,274 --> 00:53:24,539
[SPEAKER_03]: Speaking of more hacking stuff, this guy, actually, going by the name of Parasite, has shown that you can hack levels into your online Wi-Fi for Mario Kart DS, and he's been able to play such levels as the TikTok clock and other stuff.

769
00:53:26,223 --> 00:53:32,055
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think they've released how they've done this yet, but it has been shown and people have been doing it online.

770
00:53:32,436 --> 00:53:33,358
[SPEAKER_03]: It's kind of interesting.

771
00:53:33,418 --> 00:53:35,884
[SPEAKER_03]: Some of the levels kind of glitch out a little bit, but

772
00:53:37,622 --> 00:53:39,563
[SPEAKER_03]: Booby Prize Bike Race Any Tips for Winning?

773
00:54:08,154 --> 00:54:08,534
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

774
00:54:08,995 --> 00:54:11,637
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't actually finish the game or play many of the missions.

775
00:54:11,677 --> 00:54:16,182
[SPEAKER_03]: I just put a 100% code in to get all the characters for multiplayer.

776
00:54:16,202 --> 00:54:16,602
[SPEAKER_04]: Cheater!

777
00:54:17,102 --> 00:54:17,763
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, here's what.

778
00:54:17,863 --> 00:54:19,124
[SPEAKER_03]: I only play it for multiplayer.

779
00:54:19,265 --> 00:54:20,666
[SPEAKER_03]: That's all I play the game for now.

780
00:54:20,786 --> 00:54:23,589
[SPEAKER_03]: So I don't actually play three of the missions and stuff.

781
00:54:23,649 --> 00:54:26,231
[SPEAKER_03]: So I just wanted to have all the characters unlocked and everything.

782
00:54:26,531 --> 00:54:28,573
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't point fingers because I'm cheating at Silent Hill 3.

783
00:54:28,613 --> 00:54:30,735
[SPEAKER_04]: You're going to have to go to GameFAQs, my friend.

784
00:54:31,056 --> 00:54:31,336
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry.

785
00:54:31,977 --> 00:54:33,438
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, GameFAQs would be a good place to check.

786
00:54:34,662 --> 00:54:38,525
[SPEAKER_00]: I did send a very interesting link at themushroomkingdom.net.

787
00:54:40,005 --> 00:54:41,426
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the Super Mario Bros.

788
00:54:41,446 --> 00:54:42,687
[SPEAKER_00]: 3, their lost levels.

789
00:54:44,408 --> 00:54:45,989
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll just read the first paragraph from that page.

790
00:54:46,529 --> 00:54:47,670
[SPEAKER_00]: Deep within Super Mario Bros.

791
00:54:47,930 --> 00:54:49,391
[SPEAKER_00]: 3 lie hidden, unused levels.

792
00:54:49,511 --> 00:54:56,476
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of them seem polished with working goals and plenty of enemies, while others are devoid of enemies, lacking exits or too short to be full levels.

793
00:54:57,596 --> 00:54:58,957
[SPEAKER_00]: There's actually a couple of pictures of them.

794
00:54:58,997 --> 00:54:59,897
[SPEAKER_00]: One of them uses the boot.

795
00:55:00,737 --> 00:55:01,217
[SPEAKER_00]: I love the boot.

796
00:55:01,237 --> 00:55:04,198
[SPEAKER_04]: That's great because only like one level in the actual game used the boot.

797
00:55:04,498 --> 00:55:05,538
[SPEAKER_04]: And it was so short.

798
00:55:05,978 --> 00:55:06,679
[SPEAKER_04]: And the boot was cool.

799
00:55:07,079 --> 00:55:09,759
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's pretty cool because the level maps are up on the page.

800
00:55:09,839 --> 00:55:14,781
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd say people should check it out if you're an old school Super Mario Brothers player.

801
00:55:14,801 --> 00:55:16,781
[SPEAKER_00]: But you know, that actually goes back into what we were saying.

802
00:55:16,821 --> 00:55:19,782
[SPEAKER_00]: There's always unused code in games.

803
00:55:20,102 --> 00:55:26,104
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I mean, this could have easily been Mario Hot Coffee where Mario and the princess get it on.

804
00:55:28,120 --> 00:55:29,241
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

805
00:55:58,354 --> 00:56:00,376
[SPEAKER_00]: No, not, no.

806
00:56:00,736 --> 00:56:01,797
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki, anything else?

807
00:56:02,338 --> 00:56:07,322
[SPEAKER_03]: I just have one more, and that's this product has been released.

808
00:56:08,383 --> 00:56:13,127
[SPEAKER_03]: Basically, it's on this website, gameback-web.com.

809
00:56:13,507 --> 00:56:14,488
[SPEAKER_03]: It's in their web store.

810
00:56:14,588 --> 00:56:15,769
[SPEAKER_03]: It's called the PSP Bank.

811
00:56:15,849 --> 00:56:18,712
[SPEAKER_03]: It's basically a 40 gigabyte hard drive for the PSP.

812
00:56:19,652 --> 00:56:24,977
[SPEAKER_03]: What it looks actually to be is a PSP, it's a hard drive that has a USB on the go.

813
00:56:25,444 --> 00:56:28,446
[SPEAKER_03]: so you can actually transfer stuff between the hard drive and the PSP.

814
00:56:28,987 --> 00:56:32,509
[SPEAKER_03]: However, you can't actually just access the entire hard drive using the PSP.

815
00:56:33,670 --> 00:56:37,193
[SPEAKER_03]: So, not quite cool, but a step in the right direction, I guess.

816
00:56:37,593 --> 00:56:43,237
[SPEAKER_03]: And also, there was another development here, which is quite interesting.

817
00:56:43,958 --> 00:56:48,141
[SPEAKER_03]: The guy that's basically behind... Oh, what was it here?

818
00:56:50,262 --> 00:56:53,865
[SPEAKER_03]: Who's behind the cheat device for Grand Theft Auto, or

819
00:56:54,684 --> 00:56:56,326
[SPEAKER_03]: They think it's actually done the same way.

820
00:56:57,087 --> 00:57:05,738
[SPEAKER_03]: Basically working on running firmware on 2.01 and 2.5 firmware, so maybe 2.6 running the homebrew stuff.

821
00:57:06,979 --> 00:57:09,923
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's being worked on and probably cracked soon.

822
00:57:12,830 --> 00:57:17,235
[SPEAKER_04]: One more story I got for you guys, and that has to do... I knew Jamie would get a kick out of this one.

823
00:57:17,816 --> 00:57:22,421
[SPEAKER_04]: I went to Slashdot earlier this week, and I saw this, and I totally thought of you, Jamie.

824
00:57:23,122 --> 00:57:25,985
[SPEAKER_04]: The headline is, Gamers Better at Driving with Cell Phones?

825
00:57:27,822 --> 00:57:28,943
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, you know what?

826
00:57:29,343 --> 00:57:30,484
[SPEAKER_04]: Hold on, I haven't read it yet.

827
00:57:31,805 --> 00:57:32,165
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see.

828
00:57:33,466 --> 00:57:39,770
[SPEAKER_04]: These psychologists who are studying multitasking have argued for years about these information bottlenecks, and they want to know why this occurs.

829
00:57:39,810 --> 00:57:41,031
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it because people are lazy?

830
00:57:41,431 --> 00:57:43,813
[SPEAKER_04]: Because they have an inability to switch from one task to another?

831
00:57:44,193 --> 00:57:44,573
[SPEAKER_04]: Who knows?

832
00:57:44,653 --> 00:57:50,377
[SPEAKER_04]: But this Mei-Chang Lin, who is an assistant professor of psychology at Oregon State University, said...

833
00:57:52,427 --> 00:57:59,014
[SPEAKER_04]: Even with a seemingly simple task, structural cognitive limitations can prevent you from efficiently switching to a new task.

834
00:57:59,595 --> 00:58:03,920
[SPEAKER_04]: I have to say that the best ones are those who play a lot of video games, she pointed out.

835
00:58:04,878 --> 00:58:06,979
[SPEAKER_04]: Those are lab studies, however, not driving tests.

836
00:58:08,660 --> 00:58:10,521
[SPEAKER_04]: So because you play video games, you're good at multitasking.

837
00:58:10,541 --> 00:58:16,085
[SPEAKER_04]: So therefore, gamers, throw those headsets away because you can multitask.

838
00:58:16,165 --> 00:58:16,985
[SPEAKER_00]: I've said it once.

839
00:58:17,626 --> 00:58:19,247
[SPEAKER_00]: I've said it a bajillion times.

840
00:58:19,907 --> 00:58:21,988
[SPEAKER_00]: And somebody in this room is included in that.

841
00:58:22,609 --> 00:58:26,151
[SPEAKER_00]: If you drive and talk on your cell phone, you are being a big dumb butt.

842
00:58:27,031 --> 00:58:29,433
[SPEAKER_00]: You are endangering your life and those of other people.

843
00:58:30,106 --> 00:58:31,647
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm multitasking, what can I say?

844
00:58:32,067 --> 00:58:34,089
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, it's impossible to multitask.

845
00:58:34,609 --> 00:58:35,910
[SPEAKER_04]: I can multitask.

846
00:58:36,290 --> 00:58:36,930
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm a good driver.

847
00:58:38,011 --> 00:58:38,791
[SPEAKER_04]: Final thoughts.

848
00:58:39,852 --> 00:58:41,033
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki, your final thought.

849
00:58:41,133 --> 00:58:41,693
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to get better.

850
00:58:43,534 --> 00:58:45,936
[SPEAKER_04]: My final thought is I hate being sick.

851
00:58:46,496 --> 00:58:47,037
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura?

852
00:58:48,818 --> 00:58:50,159
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm tired of having the plague.

853
00:58:50,199 --> 00:58:51,920
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been sick since November 4th.

854
00:58:52,780 --> 00:58:53,981
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think I'm ever going to get better.

855
00:58:55,868 --> 00:58:57,870
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, that's a happy note to end episode 50 on.

856
00:58:57,950 --> 00:59:01,313
[SPEAKER_04]: So, congratulations, we made it through 50 episodes.

857
00:59:01,493 --> 00:59:01,993
[SPEAKER_04]: Yay!

858
00:59:03,194 --> 00:59:04,936
[SPEAKER_04]: Here we come to 51 next week.

859
00:59:04,976 --> 00:59:05,536
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll see you then.

860
00:59:06,177 --> 00:59:08,119
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, you know who we haven't heard from all episode?

861
00:59:10,661 --> 00:59:11,221
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, God.

862
00:59:11,922 --> 00:59:13,723
[SPEAKER_00]: One of our very special hosts.

863
00:59:14,104 --> 00:59:14,364
