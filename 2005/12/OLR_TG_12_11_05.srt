8
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:40,740
Avoid them tonight is episode 50 of our podcast. Yay. Yeah means 50 weeks in a row. We've been here

9
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:46,700
Podcasting is that new it's only been around like a little bit in a year, you know, so it's kind of cool

10
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:50,320
So we're just a couple weeks from a one-year anniversary. Of course that means

11
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:55,320
With me, as always, is the one and only Dark Sakura.

12
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:56,320
Hi.

13
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:57,320
How you doing?

14
00:00:57,320 --> 00:00:59,320
My voice keeps coming and going.

15
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:02,320
I still have the plague.

16
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:04,320
I do still have the plague.

17
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:10,320
It sucks because I've learned that lung cookies really are not a delicacy.

18
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:11,320
I see.

19
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:14,320
Also with us, say hello to the one and only Loki.

20
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:15,320
Hello.

21
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:16,320
How you doing?

22
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:17,320
I'm quite stuffed up.

23
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:21,520
And I'm also sick so you know what that means all three of us are sick

24
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:25,280
We all have I don't think we all have the plague, but we all have something bad

25
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:26,940
I know it's it's horrible

26
00:01:26,940 --> 00:01:32,120
We had to cancel our live show this week cuz we both have the micro plague maybe mini plague mini place

27
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:37,020
I shall call it mini plague. I don't know but it's sucks, but

28
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:42,240
We weren't gonna call in sick for episode 50 this would happen to us on like a landmark

29
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:45,140
style show to us so

30
00:01:45,140 --> 00:01:50,860
So, anyway, let's get into it, same shtick as always, what kind of stuff you been playing

31
00:01:50,860 --> 00:01:51,860
this week?

32
00:01:51,860 --> 00:01:52,860
Dark Sakura.

33
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:55,460
Um, Animal Crossing.

34
00:01:55,460 --> 00:02:01,220
I've been playing with my villagers and hitting you in the head with a net, and hitting people

35
00:02:01,220 --> 00:02:06,020
I don't know in your village with a net, and I stubbed you in the toe with my shovel.

36
00:02:06,020 --> 00:02:08,620
And you also planted a pitfall that I fell into, thank you.

37
00:02:08,620 --> 00:02:12,620
I planted one for myself so that I could fall into it right in front of you to make you

38
00:02:12,620 --> 00:02:13,700
feel better.

39
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:16,600
But you got out of it before I was able to get my bug net out and start whacking you

40
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:17,600
while you were in the hole.

41
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:19,600
So, it made me sad.

42
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:20,600
It's alright.

43
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:23,880
This is me giving you a flat look that our listeners can't hear.

44
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:26,940
Great radio.

45
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:32,680
I also have been watching Dan play a lot of that game that I'm getting really bored of

46
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:38,760
watching, the Project Gotham Racing 3, because it looks like the cars are still floating

47
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:15,760
Okay, I've been playing Animal Crossing, which is fun, and I've been playing a little bit

48
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:23,800
Need for Speed, or not Need for Speed, Ridge Racer 6, because that's cool. I've been playing

49
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:29,760
also very, very little of Project Gotham, because I kind of suck at that game, and Amp

50
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:35,680
3. Amp 3 is really fun. Yes, and I finally got my 360 because I had to go buy it from

51
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:41,680
somebody who is charging an exorbitant amount of money for it, but you know what, I'm satisfied.

52
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:45,680
Shame! You know what? It's all Microsoft's fault.

53
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:48,680
Our listeners can't see me pointing and laughing.

54
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:51,680
I don't know. You let me down, Loki. No, it's...

55
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:55,680
You know, you gotta do what makes you happy, and if that's really what makes you happy,

56
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:58,680
is one of those big white paperweights, then...

57
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:03,680
Let me put it this way, okay? I checked back with my GameStop to see what they've got, dude.

58
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:11,180
see okay maybe mine will come okay I was about 48 on the list or something like

59
00:04:11,180 --> 00:04:17,700
that that's after you know I pre-ordered that back in August so anyways they have

60
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:28,580
gotten in in the I know three weeks or so since the launch to that is it to at

61
00:04:28,580 --> 00:04:33,540
at that rate my 360 would arrive in february

62
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:36,680
so now didn't you get a tip that a bunch of Best Buy's are getting a bunch more

63
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:38,180
360's on a particular day

64
00:04:38,180 --> 00:04:41,940
yeah I don't want to wait in line, I don't want to wait early in the morning in line for this stuff

65
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:45,860
well what about our listeners who might want to know the tip

66
00:04:45,860 --> 00:04:50,700
well there's going to be a lot of 360's arriving at Best Buy for their

67
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:53,940
their December 18th sale they're gonna have

68
00:04:53,940 --> 00:04:58,340
at least 20 per store some a lot more than that

69
00:04:58,340 --> 00:05:02,220
and you can actually find, there's a whole list I posted in my live journal.

70
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:05,900
Where did you figure this out? Because the list you got looked really official.

71
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:09,620
It's on GameFAQs. Someone had posted a list that

72
00:05:09,620 --> 00:05:13,420
I guess is off of a printout or something. But anyways,

73
00:05:13,420 --> 00:05:17,660
basically most of the stores, like in our area, were getting 24 per store. One of them was

74
00:05:17,660 --> 00:05:18,580
getting 30

75
00:05:18,580 --> 00:05:22,380
or 40 I think, but that's about it, yeah.

76
00:05:22,380 --> 00:05:26,180
So if you want one, you better be waiting in line again.

77
00:05:26,180 --> 00:05:29,260
like the launch all over again which I find funny because

78
00:05:29,260 --> 00:05:33,140
Best Buy is getting, what, like, tons of these 360s

79
00:05:33,140 --> 00:05:37,860
and GameStop is getting two. What the hell?

80
00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:42,660
Well that's because for every Best Buy there's like 20 GameStops at least in this area.

81
00:05:42,660 --> 00:05:46,220
It's ridiculous. But anyways, the whole thing

82
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:50,340
is just, it's a big ripoff. Before you go buy your 360

83
00:05:50,340 --> 00:05:54,140
take a good look at what accessories you need and how much those are gonna cost.

84
00:05:54,140 --> 00:05:56,140
Let me tell you this much I

85
00:05:56,340 --> 00:06:02,040
Ended up using my entire pre-order amount of money on the 360 that I had on there

86
00:06:02,740 --> 00:06:07,140
$430 on accessories that is how much their fucking accessories cost

87
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:15,840
Okay, those controllers $50 each for the wireless ones those you know component cables try $40 for stupid cables

88
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:19,860
I mean, it's ridiculous. And if you get a core system, good luck. I

89
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:25,040
I do understand that someone went into, I think it was at my husband's store

90
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:28,820
and dropped three grand on his platinum

91
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:33,980
360 with controllers and games. Wow.

92
00:06:33,980 --> 00:06:37,460
I don't feel sorry for them one bit. For them

93
00:06:37,460 --> 00:06:40,940
losing, oh poor things losing $140

94
00:06:40,940 --> 00:06:44,700
per system they sell, oh don't fucking care

95
00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:47,860
okay. I mean even, I had

96
00:06:47,860 --> 00:06:52,460
they get a core system is the one I got and it has composite cables with it

97
00:06:52,460 --> 00:06:56,360
composite cables do have S-video on them, you have to buy separate cables which are

98
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:57,120
thirty dollars

99
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:00,320
way more than any other cables I've seen but

100
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:04,400
for S-video it's pretty ridiculous

101
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:07,720
but I might add though composite does still look really good for the system

102
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:12,920
that's pretty good for if you have really shitty TV I don't think you need

103
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:16,560
anything better than composite unless you're running an HDTV or like a

104
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:18,560
computer monitor or something.

105
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:22,560
The only thing that you will run into is the text is hard to read if you don't have S-video or something like that.

106
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:24,560
That's it.

107
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:26,560
So what are your impressions of Xbox 360?

108
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:27,560
I like it.

109
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:29,560
Is it worth all the money you poured into it?

110
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:38,560
Well, yeah, because I'm going to use it a lot in my, you know, here and with my job at work and stuff, so it is worth it in that sense.

111
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:43,560
And I was going to pick it up at some point, and I mean, other people have done the same, you know, they spent money on it.

112
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:48,720
And I just, I don't see, I had like six games waiting for the system, I just didn't want

113
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:52,760
to wait another two months to be able to not play these games or whatever.

114
00:07:52,760 --> 00:08:00,360
But so far, you know, I like it, it's pretty fun, it's definitely a pretty good game system.

115
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:04,160
Project Gotham, though, is more to like Gran Turismo than me, and I don't really like

116
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:08,440
Gran Turismo, but it is still pretty, you know, it's a nice game.

117
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:09,520
But I don't know.

118
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:12,560
I'm hoping that most of these games that come out, because I haven't played a lot of the

119
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:18,440
games yet, um, aren't just all pretty graphics and horrible gameplay.

120
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:20,680
Did you get a chance to play Perfect Dark Zero yet?

121
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:21,580
Not yet.

122
00:08:21,580 --> 00:08:23,680
It actually is pretty worthwhile.

123
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:28,420
Yeah, I don't know, you know, um, assuming you're done with your, should be all in your

124
00:08:28,420 --> 00:08:31,440
week and kind of moving into my game of the week, because you brought over the 360 tonight

125
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:35,040
and you were checking it out a little bit, um, I don't know if I saw anything that made

126
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:38,280
me go, wow, I gotta have this system, like, right now.

127
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:41,560
You know, granted the games I saw, well, Project Gotham looked probably the best out of the

128
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:46,240
you showed me, I think Project Gotham looked the best, but I don't know, it just seemed

129
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:51,360
like all it was was stuff that the Xbox could do, but now supporting HDTV, and I'm thinking,

130
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:57,400
you know, I'm lucky to have a 30 something inch HDTV, if I didn't have that, I don't

131
00:08:57,400 --> 00:09:02,000
think the game would look that much better than the regular Xbox, or a computer monitor

132
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,520
or something else to hook it up to that can support the higher end textures, so I don't

133
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:10,920
know, I'm not sure I kind of get it yet, but maybe when some other games come out, because

134
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:12,920
Because I'm definitely looking forward to some of the upcoming games.

135
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:18,920
I think there are some definitely better games coming out, like for example Ghost Recon and

136
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:19,920
Advanced Warfighter.

137
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:20,920
That game looks amazing.

138
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:25,240
Just graphically it's amazing the detail that's in the game, just like with the systems and

139
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:26,640
the weapons you use.

140
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:27,640
It's really good.

141
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:29,920
I kind of think at this point they should have just waited.

142
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:30,920
I don't...

143
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:31,920
They should have.

144
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:35,260
I understand why they, you know, were trying to rush for Christmas.

145
00:09:35,260 --> 00:09:38,880
They have become the talked about item for Christmas, which is what they wanted, but

146
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:39,880
at what price?

147
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:40,880
At what price?

148
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:45,780
I think they've really fucked up this whole launch and a lot of people are definitely

149
00:09:45,780 --> 00:09:46,780
pissed off at them.

150
00:09:46,780 --> 00:09:50,460
I mean, granted, some people aren't gonna care and they're still gonna get their 360,

151
00:09:50,460 --> 00:09:54,020
but some of them are saying, you know, fuck this, I'm gonna wait for the PS3.

152
00:09:54,020 --> 00:09:57,880
And I mean, even if that is a small percentage, that's still your core customers you're losing

153
00:09:57,880 --> 00:09:59,840
because you chose to do this.

154
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:02,180
I don't know, don't you think though that with the right game those people would come

155
00:10:02,180 --> 00:10:04,140
back to play Devil's Advocate a little bit?

156
00:10:04,140 --> 00:10:08,020
Don't you think with the right game coming out in the future, you know, especially, you

157
00:10:08,020 --> 00:10:13,000
what is it the Xbox 360 lacks right now? Role-playing games, right? Let's say that, you know, with

158
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,940
all these developments that some of the folks that were working for Square are going over

159
00:10:15,940 --> 00:10:19,100
to make games for the 360, starting their own company, when some of these games come

160
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:23,520
out, that's going to make the 360 a hell of a lot more desirable, no matter how bad their

161
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:24,520
launch was.

162
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:29,140
With all the pencils coming out for the PS3, and all that stuff too, I mean, it's...

163
00:10:29,140 --> 00:10:40,460
Microsoft did, you know, get support from Sega, Tetsuya Mizuguchi, Sakaguchi, Okamoto,

164
00:10:40,460 --> 00:10:45,340
all the big, some of the big guys that were with Square, Capcom.

165
00:10:45,340 --> 00:10:49,060
Yeah, so it's interesting to see what's going to be coming up in the future.

166
00:10:49,060 --> 00:10:50,060
I don't know.

167
00:10:50,060 --> 00:10:54,560
I just think, although this launch might be screwy, I think people, and people are talking

168
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:57,340
shit now, I think people are going to overlook it in a year.

169
00:10:57,340 --> 00:11:01,020
But you're right, it really depends on the strength of the PS3, but hopefully Sony's

170
00:11:01,020 --> 00:11:03,940
taking notes and they'll have enough chips when they're ready to go.

171
00:11:03,940 --> 00:11:08,840
Well hopefully it comes down to let's not all launch, worldwide launch was dumb.

172
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:09,840
It was really dumb.

173
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:15,100
And they didn't truly launch worldwide, they launched in three major markets, the three

174
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:16,100
biggest ones.

175
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:19,460
You split up your systems and you have shortages in three countries, I don't call that worldwide

176
00:11:19,460 --> 00:11:20,460
launch.

177
00:11:20,460 --> 00:11:22,340
I call that, oh I shipped some of my units to someplace else.

178
00:11:22,340 --> 00:11:23,340
Yeah, good point.

179
00:11:23,340 --> 00:11:26,780
Alright, anyway, as far as other games I played this week, of course Animal Crossing is big

180
00:11:26,780 --> 00:11:30,720
news and I've checked out Animal Crossing you know it's very similar to

181
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:35,220
the GameCube version it I kind of call it Animal Crossing Plus because it's

182
00:11:35,220 --> 00:11:37,740
very very similar to the GameCube version but with like new items and new

183
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:42,780
stuff and new things to do. That's ironic. Why is that? Cuz double to nomori on

184
00:11:42,780 --> 00:11:48,900
GameCube was double to nomori plus. Yeah yeah. The first one was on Nintendo 64.

185
00:11:48,900 --> 00:11:53,180
Animal Forest Plus basically. It still looks like a Nintendo 64 game. It does but

186
00:11:53,180 --> 00:11:58,900
that's okay because... It's a scrolly land. Yeah, you know, the land is different but it makes it

187
00:11:58,900 --> 00:12:02,340
nice, makes it that seamless, you know, feeling to it. It sounds like the

188
00:12:02,340 --> 00:12:07,460
objectives take longer and of course the Wi-Fi is is pretty cool. The first couple

189
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:10,300
days were rough. I was getting a lot of communication errors those first two

190
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:13,460
days but it's calmed down a lot. I've had a lot of people in and out of my village.

191
00:12:13,460 --> 00:12:18,280
What can I say? I'm an Animal Crossing whore. And it's been good. Overall, the

192
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:21,660
experience has been pretty good. Sometimes it can be really slow with that

193
00:12:21,660 --> 00:12:25,980
Wi-Fi stuff, not that you get lag, but that when somebody comes into your village,

194
00:12:25,980 --> 00:12:30,140
save, wait, here they come, save, you know,

195
00:12:30,140 --> 00:12:34,020
it's a pretty slow process, but overall, you know, can't complain.

196
00:12:34,020 --> 00:12:38,280
It certainly adds so much more to the game when you don't have to be taking a

197
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:40,280
physical memory card over to somebody else's house.

198
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:43,300
If you enjoyed Animal Crossing on the GameCube, you will

199
00:12:43,300 --> 00:12:47,980
enjoy this on the DS. I think you'll kind of find that you're kind of rediscovering

200
00:12:47,980 --> 00:12:50,100
what you liked about Animal Crossing 1 all over again. My

201
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:53,920
fear about this game is that it's gonna be another Nintendogs that in in two

202
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:57,420
weeks none of us will be playing it anymore after we all pay off our houses

203
00:12:57,420 --> 00:12:59,860
that was a problem with Animal Crossing 1 after everybody paid off their house

204
00:12:59,860 --> 00:13:06,920
bye game and I don't know I it's difficult to say at this point but it's

205
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:10,820
also you know not trying to collect all the retro Nintendo games anymore yeah

206
00:13:10,820 --> 00:13:13,980
you don't have that anymore people who still tend to their GameCube houses I

207
00:13:13,980 --> 00:13:17,500
know and there's always gonna be babysitting my village there's gonna be

208
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:22,340
the hardcore, you know, people, but for the average gamer, I think they're going to move

209
00:13:22,340 --> 00:13:26,340
on after a couple weeks. I just have this bad feeling it's going to be another Nintendogs.

210
00:13:26,340 --> 00:13:29,460
I don't know, I think it'll last longer than Nintendogs, because I think there's more to

211
00:13:29,460 --> 00:13:34,620
do, but I just, I don't know, I don't see this thrill lasting, especially with, you

212
00:13:34,620 --> 00:13:37,640
know, games that are going to be coming out in January, February. I think this was a good

213
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:41,980
time for the game to come out, but I don't know, I just don't see the honeymoon lasting

214
00:13:41,980 --> 00:13:43,700
forever with Animal Crossing.

215
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:45,900
I think it's going to stick around for a little while.

216
00:13:45,900 --> 00:13:46,900
We'll see.

217
00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:49,900
See, ever since I got Animal Crossing, I haven't touched Mario Kart.

218
00:13:49,900 --> 00:13:52,900
I'll probably go back to that, though.

219
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:58,660
Anyway, let's talk about some gaming news, what's going on in the gaming world, and since

220
00:13:58,660 --> 00:14:02,740
we've been talking Xbox 360, let's talk about the launch in Japan, which happened.

221
00:14:02,740 --> 00:14:07,500
Yes, they launched the Xbox 360 in Japan this past week, and of course it's the last of

222
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:11,040
the three major companies they're launching this in.

223
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:17,220
What's interesting though, not quite the same lines that you saw here in America.

224
00:14:17,220 --> 00:14:23,260
Over 250 people waiting in line at Sutaya, which is where this big countdown event was,

225
00:14:23,260 --> 00:14:28,820
but when you went to other stores around, Yodobashi Akiba, which is a big superstore

226
00:14:28,820 --> 00:14:34,540
in Tokyo, only 21 people lined up before 7 a.m., which is nothing compared to the lines

227
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:35,820
they had here.

228
00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:41,500
But of course, Microsoft is not calling this a failure yet in Japan, and I think a lot

229
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:45,820
of, you know, you can really tell who the MS fanboys and the anti-MS fanboys are because,

230
00:14:45,820 --> 00:14:50,580
you know, I'm sure the anti-Microsoft people are quick to jump on this and say, oops, my

231
00:14:50,580 --> 00:14:51,580
mic went out again.

232
00:14:51,580 --> 00:14:55,900
The anti-Microsoft people are quick to jump on this and say, oh, they failed, the Xbox

233
00:14:55,900 --> 00:14:57,540
360 failed in Japan.

234
00:14:57,540 --> 00:14:59,500
I don't know.

235
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:04,300
I've been pretty critical of Microsoft in the past, stupid mic, I've been pretty critical

236
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:08,460
of Microsoft in the past, but I don't say just because they had a slower launch, don't

237
00:15:08,460 --> 00:15:09,460
count them out.

238
00:15:09,460 --> 00:15:13,900
Again, we were just talking about, you know, the big games are going to be coming out later

239
00:15:13,900 --> 00:15:18,500
next year, and what are the games that Japanese gamers really want that aren't out on the

240
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:20,420
Xbox 360 at all right now?

241
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:21,620
Enchanted Arm.

242
00:15:21,620 --> 00:15:23,500
RPGs in general.

243
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:25,660
And I'm sorry, Cameo does not count.

244
00:15:25,660 --> 00:15:26,660
It's a platformer.

245
00:15:26,660 --> 00:15:27,660
Yeah.

246
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:30,140
So, don't count it out in Japan yet.

247
00:15:30,140 --> 00:15:34,420
Wait and see what happens when the dudes from Final Fantasy put out their game on the Xbox

248
00:15:34,420 --> 00:15:36,060
360 or whatever it is they're planning.

249
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:38,180
Wait and see how that does or doesn't do.

250
00:15:38,180 --> 00:15:40,700
That's the true indication of how the system's going to do, I think.

251
00:15:40,700 --> 00:15:43,260
Jamie, you have kind of a follow-up on that?

252
00:15:43,260 --> 00:15:47,620
Well, yeah, just a lot of the market analysts in Japan are really, really down on it, saying

253
00:15:47,620 --> 00:15:48,620
that...

254
00:15:48,620 --> 00:15:54,580
In fact, there's a quote on here saying that they previously thought the Xbox 360 would

255
00:15:54,580 --> 00:16:02,700
gain a major share of Japanese market by taking some of the share from Sony, but now that

256
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:07,100
prospect might not be realized given the limited attractiveness of its titles and lukewarm

257
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:08,100
functions.

258
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:10,180
That last part's a direct quote.

259
00:16:10,180 --> 00:16:21,420
However, they were saying, actually according of a survey at the CESA that, I'm sorry I'm

260
00:16:21,420 --> 00:16:22,420
getting tongue tied.

261
00:16:22,420 --> 00:16:28,360
That's why we're all feeling it tonight. Yeah CSA survey at the Tokyo game show was saying that

262
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:34,840
23% of the consumers won an Xbox 360 compared to under 21% interested in the revolution

263
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:38,880
But see the thing that gets me is that all these analysts are talking about Oh

264
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:41,600
PlayStation 3 PlayStation 3 they're comparing

265
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:48,080
They're basically comparing what exists to what might exist. I mean

266
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:53,760
we've seen the demo the tech I'm sure all of us will saw a lot of the demo

267
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:57,800
stuff you know those out on the internet now for the PlayStation 3 and I went

268
00:16:57,800 --> 00:17:03,440
into that pretty little show they had at e3 but honestly don't count your

269
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:07,480
chickens for their hatched same with Nintendo because Nintendo is you know

270
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:13,920
they're taking what's always been oranges and making apples now at least

271
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:17,960
it's what they say you know the revolution and everything gonna be not

272
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:21,320
literally making apples we don't know that they've teamed up yet but um you

273
00:17:21,320 --> 00:17:24,320
know it's certainly interesting because Nintendo it almost sounds like wants to

274
00:17:24,320 --> 00:17:27,760
go off in this entire other direction they're like you know screw specs we've

275
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:33,760
got something better I don't know I glanced over an article a few days ago

276
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:38,080
where MTV got their hands on a revolution to try it out I don't

277
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:43,680
remember the name overly I'm sure they gave the revolution the plague Loki you

278
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:46,400
have some more information about some interesting developments on the

279
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:49,160
Revolution some type of patent or something going on there yeah the

280
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:55,000
revolution they've got basically these pens for its two patents for displacement

281
00:17:55,000 --> 00:18:04,200
mapping it's basically a technique used to kind of ease rendering 3d and 2d and

282
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:09,780
what they've done is the first patent is actually about the you know displacement

283
00:18:09,780 --> 00:18:15,360
mapping itself the actual rendering and the second is on a technique that uses

284
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:19,240
basically less of the CPU to render this stuff, to make

285
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:23,360
basically their less powerful system just as powerful

286
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:27,840
is basically what it is. So my big question is does this support your theory that

287
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:30,480
the revolution, your ongoing theory throughout our past few episodes, that the

288
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:31,800
revolution is 3D?

289
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:38,720
I can't even think of the term now. Stereoscopic 3D? Yes, thank you, stereostereoscopic 3D, I hate being sick.

290
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:43,240
It doesn't really add to anything, it's basically saying that it can render stuff a lot faster.

291
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:48,880
I have some news over on PlayStation 3.

292
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:52,080
People are saying that there's no way in hell PlayStation 3 is going to launch in spring,

293
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:55,140
and Sony reassured this week, yes, they will.

294
00:18:55,140 --> 00:18:58,320
They will be releasing in the spring.

295
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:04,200
Maybe not in the U.S. though, but they will release in the spring, at least in Japan.

296
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:07,040
Very interesting.

297
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:10,960
It seems like there's this huge, still kind of question mark with the PlayStation 3.

298
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:12,320
There's still a lot about it we don't know.

299
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:16,680
spring is not that far away so it'll be interesting if this machine really does

300
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:23,760
launch in the spring but you know I'd like to see it be interesting you know

301
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:31,040
it's gonna be sort of like I think the ps2 was be released be buggy as hell be

302
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:35,520
released you know I although amazingly enough I actually have a very first

303
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:40,680
model Japanese ps2 with has never had a problem you would think too that they

304
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:44,400
learn from their previous mistakes. You'd hope. And that they're looking at what's

305
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:47,480
going on with Microsoft and maybe saying, how can we prevent this? At least I hope.

306
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:50,920
I hope everybody's looking at this. Unless they put more work into it than they've

307
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:57,120
been vocal about. We'll see. Speaking of 360, Loki, you had a story about

308
00:19:57,120 --> 00:20:02,800
basically Microsoft has come out and admitted why. Well, the 360 supposedly is

309
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:08,240
short, according to Microsoft, is because of a shortage of chips or a certain chip

310
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:13,460
that was actually needed for the 360, and because the production of this chip is not

311
00:20:13,460 --> 00:20:19,500
quite at what they want, the 360s haven't been able to be made.

312
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:26,980
Basically the yields are too low and they're outrunning the supply of the systems.

313
00:20:26,980 --> 00:20:32,460
And what they've said, though, is they're not going to be able to get back up to where

314
00:20:32,460 --> 00:20:39,160
they need to be until, like, February, which is another reason why I bought my system when

315
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:40,160
I could.

316
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:43,320
So basically, if you don't have a pre-order, don't count on it until February, unless you're

317
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:45,000
going to be camping out or something.

318
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:48,880
It's going to be very hard to get lunch.

319
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:53,940
Speaking of the 360, their backwards compatibility has been upgraded a little bit.

320
00:20:53,940 --> 00:20:57,200
They actually added support for a bunch of new games.

321
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:59,360
They said they all fall in the same family.

322
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:04,680
If you own any Tom Clancy game from the Xbox, pretty much, whether it be Ghost Recon, 2,

323
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:09,500
Summit Strike, Rainbow Six, Splinter Cell, it all now will work on your Xbox 360.

324
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:10,500
Thanks, dude.

325
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:11,500
Backward compatibility.

326
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:14,800
Yeah, it's funny, it was when they initially released this, it broke Halo 2.

327
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:18,360
Then they had to recall the patch and then they fixed it.

328
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:19,360
Oh, I didn't know about that.

329
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:20,360
Yeah, it was funny.

330
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:24,240
We were playing Halo on our 360 while I was actually watching Dan play it.

331
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:26,760
Does it really look better?

332
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:27,760
Not noticeably.

333
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:28,760
Hmm.

334
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:48,760
We played it on the Xbox plenty of times that I'm pretty familiar with what it looks like on my TV, and it did look a little more smooth, but it really wasn't a perceptible notice unless you were really looking for it.

335
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:57,760
Let's go ahead and move on now and talk a little bit about real life, because there is a big world out there outside of video games.

336
00:21:57,760 --> 00:22:05,760
And you know, if we stayed indoors and played video games all day long, we would have no time to go outside and whack people over the head with bug nets for real.

337
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:11,760
So, DarkSakura is here to remind you that there is a big world out there, and she brings you her advice column.

338
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:14,760
DarkSakura, what are you going to be telling the kids about this week?

339
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:19,760
Today's bit of advice is how to survive if you're trapped in a walk-in freezer.

340
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:22,760
Wait, wasn't that an episode of Clerks, the cartoon?

341
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:23,760
Yes, it was.

342
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:24,760
Oh, awesome.

343
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:26,760
Where it had Dante wearing the diapers saying,

344
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:30,760
I'm the biggest dumbass in the world.

345
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:35,760
Anyway, number one, tap several times on the door to get someone's attention.

346
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:40,760
Two, check the door and lock area.

347
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:45,760
By law, all walk-in freezers must have an emergency release switch on the interior.

348
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:49,760
3. Locate a power switch. Some units may have an accessible on-off switch.

349
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:51,760
Turn off the cooling element.

350
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:53,760
That would be gross.

351
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:55,760
What if you're in there with meat?

352
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:59,760
They turn it on every now and then to keep it nice and cool, but not too cold.

353
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:01,760
You'd come out smelling like meat.

354
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:02,760
Like rancid.

355
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:07,760
4. Locate boxes. Tear cardboard boxes apart and spread them on the floor.

356
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:09,760
5. Look for-

357
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:12,920
See insolation? Oh, that's smart.

358
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:16,600
See, I'd die. I'd die. I'd see the picture. I'd die in the damn freezer.

359
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:19,880
I heard people sleep in boxes. Oh, okay. That makes sense. Thanks.

360
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:25,160
4. Look for insulating materials. Lie down on the cardboard and cover yourself with

361
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:28,160
paper, foam, or straw to preserve vinyl. Or salami.

362
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:31,360
And beer bottles.

363
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:35,600
6. Tap on the door every 15 minutes until help arrives. And actually in the little picture, it shows

364
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:38,360
somebody sitting there with an open container of ice cream and a spoon.

365
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:46,360
But my final piece of advice is, you know, just leave the door open.

366
00:23:46,360 --> 00:23:50,360
When you're cleaning out your freezer at the 7-11, just leave the door open.

367
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:56,360
And if you're in the freezer at the 7-11, you could probably get out through where they have, like, the drinks or something.

368
00:23:56,360 --> 00:24:00,360
Do us one, dive through the eggs.

369
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:05,360
Wow, okay. Moving on, we have a nice follow-up story.

370
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:10,360
You remember a couple weeks ago on the show here, we had Matt from the Save Kings Quest 9 campaign

371
00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:16,360
was on the show to talk about, you know how Kings Quest 9 had a stop put to it by the man, basically, at Vivendi,

372
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:19,360
and they were doing this huge letter-writing campaign to get it going again?

373
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:23,360
Well, guess what? They kinda succeeded. It worked.

374
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:24,360
Really?

375
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:30,120
Vivendi has granted a license, it's what they're calling a fan license, to allow

376
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:35,240
King's Quest IX, every cloak has a silver lining to come out. However, one small

377
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:38,560
change, they will have to alter the title to take King's Quest out of the title,

378
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:43,320
they will be releasing the game simply as a silver lining. However, all the

379
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:46,600
King's Quest characters get to stay intact. Presumably the reason why Vivendi

380
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:49,880
would be asking them to drop the name would be in case, you know, they see that

381
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:52,960
this thing does really well, maybe they want to go, maybe we really should put

382
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:59,600
out of King's Quest. Maybe we made a bad decision. Yeah, you did. But, kind of cool. I mean,

383
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:03,620
you kind of have to applaud Vivendi here. They were, you know, looked at as the big

384
00:25:03,620 --> 00:25:08,460
evil man and here they are doing the right thing here in this case, I think. You know,

385
00:25:08,460 --> 00:25:12,620
why sit on this copyright if you're not going to do anything with it. Let some people who

386
00:25:12,620 --> 00:25:17,680
just want to have some fun and pay homage and keep your name out there do their thing.

387
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:21,380
Think if they really wanted to do the big thing, then hire them to make it.

388
00:25:21,380 --> 00:25:24,500
think so I maybe it depends on how well this does because it's supposedly gonna

389
00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:27,900
be part of a trilogy the silver lining thing is all part of a trilogy they

390
00:25:27,900 --> 00:25:31,940
wanted to they're going all nine yards with this thing no pun intended we shall

391
00:25:31,940 --> 00:25:35,940
see be fun I'll download it I'll check it out I hope Rosella's in it instead of

392
00:25:35,940 --> 00:25:41,020
calling it King's Quest it could be like Kings look around well they're just

393
00:25:41,020 --> 00:25:43,500
dropping the Kings question it's gonna have the characters but it won't it

394
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:47,420
won't reference that name I know I know well I thought was Queen's journey we

395
00:25:47,420 --> 00:25:53,520
decided on a previous... anyway forget it. Monarch Trek. Let's talk about video game

396
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:58,400
movie news. Oh, we all love video game movie news, don't we? First off, Silent

397
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:02,780
Hill. Website opened up. They're doing this poster competition, design a

398
00:26:02,780 --> 00:26:06,040
poster, win an advanced screening thing. Dark Soccer, you better be entering this

399
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:11,440
thing, because I want to go. You know, I have finals. There's a little teaser trailer

400
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:15,920
thing posted on the site. It's very sexy, I gotta say. It's just like trailers for

401
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:20,120
the game. And Pyramid Head you can see for like.5 seconds. And nurse's feet. You can

402
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:23,160
see the nurse's feet. So it's very cool because they're advertising the movie like it's a

403
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:26,760
game. They said it's not, it's not, I gotta put this out there, it's not a real trailer.

404
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:31,120
It's the flash animation from the site. Yeah. But presumably, you know, if the real trailer

405
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:35,680
looks like that, it's gonna be sexy. We have high hopes for this game. Do not disappoint

406
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:39,960
us. However, one minor disappointment this week, I think this is a disappointment, um,

407
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:44,800
it was reported that Akira Yamauka will not actually be doing the music for the Silent

408
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:48,800
He did the music for the games, he will not be doing the music for the movie.

409
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:52,800
That honor will go to Jeff Danna, who did the music for Resident Evil Apocalypse.

410
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:56,800
However, he has said, I know Jamie wants to get something in there because she's mad,

411
00:26:56,800 --> 00:27:01,800
but, however, I do want to say that he's, the executive producer Andrew Mason said

412
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:06,800
that Jeff Danna will be incorporating elements from the original game's score

413
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:08,800
into the movie's score, so at least you get that.

414
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:09,800
That's what I was going to say.

415
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:10,800
Oh, okay.

416
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:14,940
I've been like every day looking at Silent Hill stuff

417
00:27:14,940 --> 00:27:19,620
I would still at least like to see Akira get to do like a vocal song or something, you know

418
00:27:19,620 --> 00:27:25,560
Cuz he did such great songs for the games that could have been I don't think they would have ever been a runaway MTV hit

419
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:28,680
But I think they could have really appealed to the audience that would go see Silent Hill

420
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:32,420
You know the songs like you're not here from three and you know

421
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:38,600
Stuff from four like really in vain this breaks the pattern of movie game, you know

422
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:45,600
I hope so, too. It looks pretty dead on so far. If that flash trailer is anything that was that was

423
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:51,640
Exactly how it should be exactly. Well, apparently I'd play it for you guys, but we're a radio show

424
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:55,140
Just just go to the site and check it out. Well, I didn't I

425
00:27:55,880 --> 00:27:58,520
Actually don't have the link on me because it's on my home computer

426
00:27:59,320 --> 00:28:04,120
But I had seen a site that had a bit more

427
00:28:04,120 --> 00:28:09,360
information they've as far as the characters and it there there is are at

428
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:16,160
least mentions to characters that are in the other Silent Hill games and they are

429
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:22,240
bringing in Dalia and Alessa from the first game mm-hmm and somebody else who

430
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:25,960
I think was referred to in the third game and give me a second well that

431
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:28,240
makes sense though because the third game was kind of a continuation of the

432
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:33,200
first story so but it is actually from what I understand officially part of the

433
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:38,280
whole Silent Hill story just because if this if this movie does well I want to

434
00:28:38,280 --> 00:28:41,800
see a sequel all right other movie news remember how we talked about last week

435
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:45,160
that there's that guy who did hellboy who they're trying to get to do halo he

436
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:48,480
may not really do halo because he really wants to do hellboy 2 they say he's torn

437
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:52,640
so we'll see I can't even remember the guy's name del toro del toro I don't

438
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:57,520
know there okay it's the director let's wait till we see some shots from the set

439
00:28:57,520 --> 00:29:03,760
and then we'll get excited. One other video game news thing though, even when

440
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:08,400
you consider that Doom did not do too hot at the box office, it made 49 million

441
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:14,560
worldwide on a 60 million budget, they are going to do a return to Castle

442
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:19,920
Wolfenstein movie, at least that's what ID software wants to do, nobody is, I

443
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:24,360
don't think bought this yet, but they want a movie for return to Castle

444
00:29:24,360 --> 00:29:29,320
Wolfenstein which you might know is you know in some ways the predecessor to Doom

445
00:29:29,320 --> 00:29:35,720
if you go as far back as Wolfenstein 3d so do the first-person crap they better

446
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:43,680
not I actually did find that information by the way yes just actually I found it

447
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:46,980
on a Wikipedia that's where I had seen it there's a character in the movie

448
00:29:46,980 --> 00:29:50,640
called Christabella who if I remember correctly was also a character in the

449
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:57,480
comic series and several of the people the main character rose her last name is

450
00:29:57,480 --> 00:30:05,960
Mason which was Heather was Cheryl Mason and Harry Mason and there's also a

451
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:12,640
Sharon Mason in this and also other I think another character in here relates

452
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:15,920
to another character that had been in Silent Hill 3 it sounds like they're

453
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:19,960
staying pretty faithful don't let me down yeah all right moving on now let's

454
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:24,480
Let's talk about, let's see, well here's a game we were talking about a heck of a lot

455
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:27,460
earlier in the show, Animal Crossing DS.

456
00:30:27,460 --> 00:30:31,100
And this was a story I ended up finding on dig.com, which I thought was interesting because

457
00:30:31,100 --> 00:30:36,760
they labeled this, the headline, Animal Crossing Speaks Out Against the RIAA, and I was kinda

458
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:37,760
like, WTF?

459
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:40,800
Yeah, I saw that last night.

460
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:45,440
I went to the, I did not do the KK Slider thing, because I, he comes to your town, what,

461
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:46,440
Saturday night?

462
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:50,840
I was seven seven thirty to eight is his warm-up eight to midnight is the show. I I

463
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:53,320
Usually go out clubbing

464
00:30:53,320 --> 00:30:55,220
Saturday nights, but not last I was coughing

465
00:30:55,220 --> 00:30:59,320
But anyway, no, this is interesting and part of what KK slider says is a little introduction

466
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:04,180
Those industry fat cats try to put a price on my music, but it wants to be free

467
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:08,360
I think somebody might be taking that a little too far

468
00:31:08,360 --> 00:31:12,640
I don't know if I'd see that as a slam against the RIAA, but that was the first impression

469
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:15,540
I got he said a little bit more than that. I I don't know

470
00:31:15,540 --> 00:31:20,940
I just kind of got the sense it fits into his character cuz you know, he's he's supposed to be this wandering nomad guy

471
00:31:20,940 --> 00:31:22,940
Well, he gives you like copies of his

472
00:31:24,020 --> 00:31:27,360
I don't know. I think people might be taking that a little far

473
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:32,300
I don't know if I think it would not be in Nintendo's best interest to speak out against the RIAA, but

474
00:31:33,020 --> 00:31:39,160
The bit of Nintendo was actually really worried about putting that impression. They would have phrased that line a little differently

475
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:41,160
I guess you got a point true

476
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:46,320
Now, I've got to ask about this because we've been talking about a lot of new consoles here

477
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:49,960
tonight, but I want to hear about an old console, and Loki, you have some pretty exciting news

478
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:51,200
regarding an old console.

479
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:58,880
Yeah, Sega is apparently, well, it's a rumor of course, but some German gaming site, Gamefront.de,

480
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:03,520
is claiming that they're going to be re-releasing the Dreamcast, basically.

481
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:10,560
It's bundled with some limited edition phone card or something, but it's supposed to probably

482
00:32:10,560 --> 00:32:17,000
only be released in Japan and distributed through Sega Direct for about $83 US or 10,000

483
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,000
yen.

484
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:23,320
Or you could just go to GameStop and get a used one for like 30 bucks, however much they're

485
00:32:23,320 --> 00:32:24,320
running.

486
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:26,240
I know, it's still a neat idea.

487
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:28,040
I still play my Dreamcast.

488
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:30,360
I would be doing homebrew on that Dreamcast.

489
00:32:30,360 --> 00:32:35,720
I watched a show that just happened to be on TV when we were done watching whatever

490
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:37,500
it was we were watching.

491
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:43,860
It had one of the Wayne brothers in it, but the little kid in that was playing a Dreamcast.

492
00:32:43,860 --> 00:32:44,860
I thought it was funny.

493
00:32:44,860 --> 00:32:45,860
That's cool.

494
00:32:45,860 --> 00:32:50,460
All right, speaking about releases, let's talk about upcoming release dates for different

495
00:32:50,460 --> 00:32:51,460
games.

496
00:32:51,460 --> 00:32:54,260
Loki, any word on what's going on in the US?

497
00:32:54,260 --> 00:32:59,660
Dead or Alive 4 slowly creeping its way to 2006.

498
00:32:59,660 --> 00:33:02,660
It's right now actually lingering on December 27th.

499
00:33:02,660 --> 00:33:04,780
Why don't they just say, we'll put it out when it's done?

500
00:33:04,780 --> 00:33:07,460
Why don't they just say that, we'll put it out when it's done?

501
00:33:07,460 --> 00:33:12,180
27th. Yeah, two days after Christmas is a great day to put out a video game.

502
00:33:12,180 --> 00:33:16,940
That's what I say. I don't know. I guess people could use gift cards and stuff, but still.

503
00:33:16,940 --> 00:33:20,460
I'll pick it up. I mean, it looks cool. So, I don't play fighting games, but...

504
00:33:20,460 --> 00:33:23,580
It was one of the games that made me want to get a 360. It looks cool. Back when I thought

505
00:33:23,580 --> 00:33:25,220
I'd be able to walk in a store and get one.

506
00:33:25,220 --> 00:33:28,420
Alright. So. What's going on? Oh, anything else?

507
00:33:28,420 --> 00:33:32,460
Um, as far as big releases coming up, um, beyond that,

508
00:33:32,460 --> 00:33:37,120
not too much in 360s stuff. Um, you've got College Hoops 2K6 coming out

509
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:42,800
in January, as well as Top Spin 2, which we actually got to play at E3 a little bit.

510
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:48,720
And other than that, the normal consoles, we have 25 The Life, which is coming out,

511
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:56,720
Ape Escape 3, and then Final Fantasy IV Advance on the 13th, I found that one out, the hard

512
00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:57,720
way.

513
00:33:57,720 --> 00:33:59,640
Final Fantasy IV on the 13th of January?

514
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:01,440
No, of December, this week.

515
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:04,380
Yes, yes, that's this week.

516
00:34:04,380 --> 00:34:11,060
And then, of course, Trueswink Golf, you're a golf fan for the DS, that's pretty good.

517
00:34:11,060 --> 00:34:14,820
It's basically a pretty weak month, February it's going to start picking up again though.

518
00:34:14,820 --> 00:34:15,820
Sounds good.

519
00:34:15,820 --> 00:34:18,180
And what's going on with our friends over at The Big Pond?

520
00:34:18,180 --> 00:34:21,900
I've only got like three real dates, and the others are like fourth quarter.

521
00:34:21,900 --> 00:34:22,900
That's alright.

522
00:34:22,900 --> 00:34:32,580
16th Sims 2, 17th King Kong for the GBA, 23rd Madden NFL 2006 for the PSP, and some of

523
00:34:32,580 --> 00:34:38,900
The others mentioned without Daze, SoCom 3, Shaman King, Snowboard Kids DS, America's

524
00:34:38,900 --> 00:34:45,960
Army, Bioshock, Call of Cthulhu, Dead to Rights, a few titles along those lines.

525
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:50,880
Now, just out of this morbid curiosity, do they have to alter Madden NFL when they release

526
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:55,320
it in Britain because football is not football there?

527
00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:56,320
It's different.

528
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:57,640
As far as I was aware, it's just called American football.

529
00:34:57,640 --> 00:35:01,600
Oh, well, I don't know if that means they gotta recode stuff in the game or whatever.

530
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:05,100
No, it's just called NFL, so I'll be in the National Football League.

531
00:35:05,100 --> 00:35:07,100
Just curious, just want my curiosity thing.

532
00:35:07,100 --> 00:35:09,100
I was going to mention one thing since we're talking about the UK.

533
00:35:09,100 --> 00:35:20,100
The official Xbox 360 magazine is going to be, the January issue is going to have a disc to be able to play the Final Fantasy XI beta on the 360.

534
00:35:20,100 --> 00:35:21,100
Here, or in the UK?

535
00:35:21,100 --> 00:35:25,100
I think in the UK I'm not sure about here, but maybe.

536
00:35:25,100 --> 00:35:27,100
So check that out.

537
00:35:27,100 --> 00:35:30,100
Well lucky you guys, if you guys get that in America doesn't.

538
00:35:30,100 --> 00:35:35,320
Another interesting game one here is Shin Megami Tensei, which we actually got over

539
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:36,320
here.

540
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:38,320
Yeah, a digital double saga.

541
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:42,720
Alright, well, speaking of UK, I understand that in our mailbag this week we heard from

542
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:47,000
quite a few people over in the UK, so of course we encourage you guys to email us whenever

543
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:51,040
you have something to say, togo at orangelaungeradio.com, that's the place to be, and of course you

544
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:57,880
can always visit our website too at www.orangelaungeradio.com and post in the forums and what have you.

545
00:35:57,880 --> 00:36:00,200
Let's go over and open up the old mailbag, Dark Sakura.

546
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:08,080
Oh, actually, we, uh, didn't get a number of, uh, emails, um, and most everybody, there

547
00:36:08,080 --> 00:36:13,360
was a pretty big consensus on how it is the job of the parent, you know, to...

548
00:36:13,360 --> 00:36:15,800
Oh, last week's follow-up, and we had the, you know...

549
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:21,280
That's what a lot, that's what a lot of it was, um, there was one in particular, though.

550
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:26,040
Um, okay, here we go, it's one from, uh, one of our listeners from outside London.

551
00:36:26,040 --> 00:36:29,760
Is this the one you read me before the show?

552
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:30,760
Listen up.

553
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:31,760
This is great.

554
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:32,760
Listen to this.

555
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:33,760
By Gareth.

556
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:38,080
Hey guys, was listening to your show on the way to work today.

557
00:36:38,080 --> 00:36:40,000
I live just outside London, UK by the way.

558
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:46,240
I have a 2.75 year old daughter which piqued my interest in your chat about parents' responsibility

559
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:47,240
with their kids.

560
00:36:47,240 --> 00:36:51,540
So my daughter and I play games together, mostly things like Trackmania Sunrise, she

561
00:36:51,540 --> 00:36:56,340
likes painting the cars, to Incredibles to Super Mario Sunshine.

562
00:36:56,340 --> 00:37:00,380
She also has some kids games like Dora the Explorer along with some web games on the

563
00:37:00,380 --> 00:37:01,380
BBC.

564
00:37:01,380 --> 00:37:03,940
So my point, I was surprised at two things.

565
00:37:03,940 --> 00:37:07,260
One, it is hard to get games that don't feature some sort of violence.

566
00:37:07,260 --> 00:37:11,420
We are by nature a society that violence has a part of it.

567
00:37:11,420 --> 00:37:16,000
Two, she was very quick to pick up on the violent parts of games and knows when she

568
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,140
is hitting someone or something.

569
00:37:18,140 --> 00:37:21,980
She even vocalizes it by saying hit or shoot when she does this.

570
00:37:21,980 --> 00:37:24,980
After being a bit worried about this, I thought this is not a problem.

571
00:37:24,980 --> 00:37:28,420
She has parents who monitor and guide her behavior and we have not seen her try to replicate

572
00:37:28,420 --> 00:37:30,620
the violence she has seen on the game so far.

573
00:37:30,620 --> 00:37:36,620
I know from my experience as a long time gamer and now a parent, that is my parent's guidance

574
00:37:36,620 --> 00:37:40,420
and active parenting that made the biggest difference to me being well adjusted while

575
00:37:40,420 --> 00:37:42,180
some think so.

576
00:37:42,180 --> 00:37:45,940
You won't be able to change your kids' environments and their exposure to violence that easily,

577
00:37:45,940 --> 00:37:49,500
But you definitely can be a big influence and how they react and live with it

578
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:56,040
And I thought that last year if we put there was the best way anyone could ever say it you have major kudos from me

579
00:37:56,660 --> 00:37:58,340
beautifully put

580
00:37:58,340 --> 00:38:02,660
That's right. Can you get it through one more email? I can get through a couple. All right, cool. Um

581
00:38:04,420 --> 00:38:06,420
Also, um got an email from

582
00:38:07,140 --> 00:38:10,420
Deep in one of our Australian list. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I'm

583
00:38:11,380 --> 00:38:12,900
talking about the

584
00:38:12,900 --> 00:38:18,500
50 cent game 50 cent. Oh god. Oh my god. I watched like five minutes of the

585
00:38:19,420 --> 00:38:26,220
This bike TV video game awards and I saw like a little bit of that 50 cent game and I was just like this is

586
00:38:26,940 --> 00:38:31,000
Well, I don't this is so not the type of game that appeals to me in any way shape or form

587
00:38:31,260 --> 00:38:38,900
Well, you said the the 50 cent game been banned in Australia for drug use and excessive violence and for sucking really bad

588
00:38:38,900 --> 00:38:43,900
I don't think you can ban a game for sucking, if that were the case, there would be a lot of games that wouldn't be on the market now.

589
00:38:43,900 --> 00:38:55,900
Actually, there's something worse, and unfortunately Konami's, um, stent into the beat-em-up game genre, uh, crime life gang wars. Horrible reviews. Horrible reviews.

590
00:38:55,900 --> 00:38:58,900
Really? That's too bad.

591
00:38:58,900 --> 00:39:06,780
As I was reading sorry to quote down here if a game gets an R rating it literally can't be sold in stores other titles

592
00:39:06,780 --> 00:39:10,640
Include the original GTA 3 game where you could pick up hookers and screw them to get back life

593
00:39:10,940 --> 00:39:14,980
Which was edited out and re-released and manhunt in cases like this

594
00:39:14,980 --> 00:39:19,920
You guys are lucky that your stuff only get censored as much as they do and not completely banned from stores like our stuff. Oh

595
00:39:20,660 --> 00:39:25,920
And he also mentioned that a claim is bankrupt and now selling off rights to game so we could get the rights to bust

596
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:30,320
to move if we wanted it oh yeah that's right I did a story on my my live show

597
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:33,200
on the station this week about that that's kind of interesting and and I

598
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:36,280
thought it was interesting because only one of the Mary Kate Ashley Wilson games

599
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:42,880
sought after out of the like we're global there was another another point

600
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:47,000
made by one of our listeners in Scotland I've been getting a lot of overseas

601
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:53,760
writing these days I think it's pretty cool yeah it's neat um from Sloane said

602
00:39:53,760 --> 00:40:04,840
who's got three kids, 33, and um, I just completely lost where I was reading, said, um, part of

603
00:40:04,840 --> 00:40:08,560
the course is to discover your market when designing a game. You come up with an overall

604
00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:12,880
concept and test the market to see who your primary persona is. They mentioned a site

605
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:18,460
that's uh, d-e-s-a dot com, Entertainment Software Association, that has a report called

606
00:40:18,460 --> 00:40:23,940
essential facts about the computer and video game industry, um, so that has, um, some interesting

607
00:40:23,940 --> 00:40:30,940
statistics. For example, the average age of a game buyer is 37, so it's really the parents

608
00:40:34,620 --> 00:40:39,420
that are buying the games, the older sibling buying the games. And most of the time, it's

609
00:40:39,420 --> 00:40:43,580
the kid saying, hey, I want this game, or their parents saying, hey kid, do you want

610
00:40:43,580 --> 00:40:50,180
this game and the kid going sure I'd like the suffering and yes I've actually

611
00:40:50,180 --> 00:40:55,500
seen this happen just recently at one of our local video game stores so I know

612
00:40:55,500 --> 00:41:00,100
very well but to quote I'm gonna read this one's paragraph here I think is

613
00:41:00,100 --> 00:41:05,420
very important parents need to be educated you wouldn't take your kid to

614
00:41:05,420 --> 00:41:10,340
an 18 certificate movie or would you my son the 11 year old has a friend whose

615
00:41:10,340 --> 00:41:13,720
parents regularly let him watch horror movies and play video games such as GTA

616
00:41:13,720 --> 00:41:20,200
and Doom 3. There's a lack of parental instruction here. I bet what my children

617
00:41:20,200 --> 00:41:22,520
see when they are in my sight but what are the parents

618
00:41:22,520 --> 00:41:26,640
I'm sorry but what are the other parents exposing my child to when they visit

619
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:31,280
their friends friends and he also goes on for this says by age means this kid

620
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:33,960
is mature enough when you're 11 you laugh at dick and fart jokes and naked

621
00:41:33,960 --> 00:41:38,440
women but that's not particularly mature. I'm still doing that at 27. We still tell

622
00:41:38,440 --> 00:41:46,280
them but you know I thought this was pretty pretty smart make the law similar

623
00:41:46,280 --> 00:41:50,880
to DVD video and liquor sales if you supply to underage person you can be

624
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:55,080
prosecuted parents know your ratings they are not difficult and I agree with

625
00:41:55,080 --> 00:42:02,360
Rob that ratings should be the same as movies GTA series are rated by the by

626
00:42:02,360 --> 00:42:07,440
the BBFC as an 18 same as violent movie I hear over here in the UK he also

627
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:10,560
mentions to Matt you two are quite correct parents should do their own

628
00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:13,720
homework who's responsible for a kid when they're out in the street playing

629
00:42:13,720 --> 00:42:16,700
it's no longer acceptable to say it's okay he's upstairs playing on his

630
00:42:16,700 --> 00:42:24,760
computer look what happened to Matthew Broderick that's a good reference I'm

631
00:42:24,760 --> 00:42:27,960
just playing a game I'm thrilled that someone agrees with me that makes 50

632
00:42:27,960 --> 00:42:31,960
episodes of doing this crap so worth it that somebody agrees with me my last

633
00:42:31,960 --> 00:42:35,400
thing on this my last thing yes it said I leave you with the quote from a

634
00:42:35,400 --> 00:42:39,400
congressional hearing chaired by Joe Lieberman. This was a few years ago.

635
00:42:39,400 --> 00:42:44,220
This was nice to see he still hates video games. This quote is from Marilyn

636
00:42:44,220 --> 00:42:47,700
Dross, the VP of National Coalition of Television Violence. This is what she had

637
00:42:47,700 --> 00:42:51,600
to say. If the Pentagon was to ever have suggested years ago that we put video

638
00:42:51,600 --> 00:42:56,000
games that teach children how to aim guns and train them at the age of eight

639
00:42:56,000 --> 00:43:00,000
to be soldiers and ever invented a game to put in the homes of young boys to

640
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:03,880
train them to be in the military, I can't begin to tell you...you know

641
00:43:03,880 --> 00:43:08,000
What kind of upward there would be in this country if our government was to start training early killers?

642
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:17,480
Is it mentioned on there Americans are America's are mostly in that what America's Army does she was talking about the Nintendo Super Scope I

643
00:43:20,680 --> 00:43:25,680
Thought that was such a wonderful point and this whole the Nintendo Super Scope was nothing

644
00:43:25,680 --> 00:43:32,860
I know I was playing blastress. I don't blot in the mole game. Come on. This bowl game was stupid, but hey

645
00:43:33,240 --> 00:43:37,320
But I would honestly I would really for those last two letters

646
00:43:37,320 --> 00:43:41,680
I would really love to have our writers a permission to post those on our site

647
00:43:41,680 --> 00:43:47,000
Really because those are the most well thought-out things I have read in the past couple weeks

648
00:43:47,860 --> 00:43:53,960
Awesome. Well if you guys want to send us an email to go to go at orange launch radio.com any last little bits

649
00:43:53,960 --> 00:43:59,900
you want to read anything um it's really I've gotten several emails along the

650
00:43:59,900 --> 00:44:07,140
same lines uh one of our friends uh our listeners John wrote in you know

651
00:44:07,140 --> 00:44:12,680
basically saying more of the same you know I especially like the point the

652
00:44:12,680 --> 00:44:18,420
point saying is that you know no matter if you're into the violent games listen

653
00:44:18,420 --> 00:44:25,140
you know emo music or or you know like horror movies you know you can still be

654
00:44:25,140 --> 00:44:31,160
a peaceful person you know I really liked that one point you're saying emo

655
00:44:31,160 --> 00:44:34,760
reminds me of this simple fact do you know what is ten times worse than video

656
00:44:34,760 --> 00:44:40,680
games emo no myspace I swear to God myspace is worse than any video game I've

657
00:44:40,680 --> 00:44:47,100
ever seen I mean really and every kid has a profile on myspace it's sad well I

658
00:44:47,100 --> 00:44:52,100
I thought it was funny that he did actually mirror something that you said, um, I'll just quote this last and that's then to the mailbox.

659
00:44:52,100 --> 00:44:52,600
Alrighty.

660
00:44:52,600 --> 00:44:53,600
Cause we got a lot of mail this time around.

661
00:44:53,600 --> 00:44:54,100
I know.

662
00:44:54,100 --> 00:44:59,100
This law is not a ban, it's simply a way to prevent kids from buying games that their parents might not approve of.

663
00:44:59,100 --> 00:45:03,100
Honest, caring, and hardworking parents work until 5 or 6 p.m.

664
00:45:03,100 --> 00:45:07,100
With their child at home, they can't prevent them from going to the store and buying a GTA-type game.

665
00:45:07,100 --> 00:45:09,100
True. True.

666
00:45:09,100 --> 00:45:14,100
And in that respect, I do support that aspect of it, and I think I said as much last week.

667
00:45:14,100 --> 00:45:21,360
it's just that I still think that it is really difficult I think on parents to

668
00:45:21,360 --> 00:45:26,040
have that kind of active stance in their children's lives but I still think that

669
00:45:26,040 --> 00:45:29,080
you know if they weren't ready for the responsibility they shouldn't have had

670
00:45:29,080 --> 00:45:32,680
the children to begin with all right well we look forward to getting your

671
00:45:32,680 --> 00:45:36,280
more emails to go and orange not sure that I'll come let's get back into some

672
00:45:36,280 --> 00:45:41,040
news now Loki I brought up the video game awards on Spike TV there a little

673
00:45:41,040 --> 00:45:43,840
bit I know you you caught a little glimpse of it or did you watch a whole

674
00:45:43,840 --> 00:45:49,080
damn thing or what happened? I watched the after show, and the first part

675
00:45:49,080 --> 00:45:51,440
of the show, and that's when Nellie started waking up and she's like, what the hell's

676
00:45:51,440 --> 00:45:56,760
on TV? And I was like, uhhh, video game show. Anyways,

677
00:45:56,760 --> 00:45:59,920
so at the after show they were showing a bunch of trailers for games that were coming out

678
00:45:59,920 --> 00:46:06,560
including Splinter Cell 4, which I'm now calling 24 the Game 2, because it looks very similar

679
00:46:06,560 --> 00:46:10,640
to it. Anyways, but lots of cool games coming out,

680
00:46:10,640 --> 00:46:15,440
excited about that stuff, but the best part though, is I think this is the way video game

681
00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:20,680
war shows should be. I mean, this is really good actually. It was a very good show, definitely

682
00:46:20,680 --> 00:46:26,400
a whole lot better than G4ia. What they started off with is Samuel L. Jackson because he was

683
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:30,240
hosting the whole thing, I mean that's good just from the start. He was playing the part

684
00:46:30,240 --> 00:46:35,040
of, and I haven't played this far into the Warriors or I haven't seen the movie yet,

685
00:46:35,040 --> 00:46:38,320
the main character in the Warriors, you know the guy in the beginning, the CAN YOU DIG

686
00:46:38,320 --> 00:46:45,320
But they had all the video game characters in the audience and the crowd, and the best part about the whole thing is you see Katamari rolling around.

687
00:46:45,320 --> 00:46:49,320
It's picking up people as it's going along and stuff, and that was the greatest thing ever.

688
00:46:49,320 --> 00:46:54,320
And then Tack from Tack 3 or whatever, he's all,

689
00:46:54,320 --> 00:46:55,320
He's all,

690
00:46:55,320 --> 00:46:58,320
Why yes! Come out and play!

691
00:46:58,320 --> 00:47:04,320
And he shoots Samuel L. Jackson, and I thought that was great, it was really funny.

692
00:47:04,320 --> 00:47:10,200
And they put a whole MTV Music Awards spin on it, and I really liked the way they did

693
00:47:10,200 --> 00:47:11,200
that.

694
00:47:11,200 --> 00:47:13,160
I watched about five minutes, I thought it was stupid.

695
00:47:13,160 --> 00:47:14,160
Sorry.

696
00:47:14,160 --> 00:47:17,240
The music part was stupid, but I did like the fact that they were doing this kind of

697
00:47:17,240 --> 00:47:20,520
fun little twist on it and stuff.

698
00:47:20,520 --> 00:47:26,160
However though, there's only really two awards shows out there, they are still highly superior

699
00:47:26,160 --> 00:47:27,160
to G4U.

700
00:47:27,160 --> 00:47:28,160
We'll see.

701
00:47:28,160 --> 00:47:31,560
Jamie, I'm curious if you've heard about this, because I'm sure you've got to have an opinion

702
00:47:31,560 --> 00:47:32,560
on this.

703
00:47:32,560 --> 00:47:36,280
the wrong way to hold a protest did you hear about this kid I was like some 16

704
00:47:36,280 --> 00:47:42,160
year old kid got basically arrested or charged anyway by threatening the one

705
00:47:42,160 --> 00:47:48,480
and only Jack Thompson with torture and death he basically I don't know sent this

706
00:47:48,480 --> 00:47:51,400
thing to say all these nasty things he was going to do to Jack Thompson it's

707
00:47:51,400 --> 00:47:55,000
kind of one of those like yeah you remember on the old Animaniacs good idea

708
00:47:55,000 --> 00:48:01,040
bad idea this would be bad idea how old was he 16 I think so about he's gonna be

709
00:48:01,040 --> 00:48:08,880
out soon but I'm kind of paraphrasing from what I read earlier this week yeah

710
00:48:08,880 --> 00:48:14,560
stupid stupid stupid thing to do very stupid you know what I think is

711
00:48:14,560 --> 00:48:21,720
interesting though is who put out the press release on this Jack Thompson do

712
00:48:21,720 --> 00:48:27,480
anything yeah I know and I feel bad because now I'm contributing to this but

713
00:48:27,480 --> 00:48:30,140
I'm only reporting what's out there on the internet because half the gaming

714
00:48:30,140 --> 00:48:34,820
sites out there also reported this it's kind of like I thought I thought we were

715
00:48:34,820 --> 00:48:41,600
bad attention whores he needs to get death threats just realize that nobody

716
00:48:41,600 --> 00:48:48,020
cares and I'm tired of talking about him well no now to say that I think this kid

717
00:48:48,020 --> 00:48:53,060
went a little far but I you know what he was fight amongst yourselves fight

718
00:48:53,060 --> 00:48:56,840
amongst yourselves that's all I wanted to say on that I don't want to go I say

719
00:48:56,840 --> 00:49:02,860
for the rest of the month unless he gets cancer of the liver.

720
00:49:02,860 --> 00:49:03,860
No more jack talk.

721
00:49:03,860 --> 00:49:05,480
You're going to get sued for that.

722
00:49:05,480 --> 00:49:11,000
I am not saying that I am going to inject him with cancerous cells so that he dies of

723
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:17,520
liver cancer, but if he does, I'd like to report it.

724
00:49:17,520 --> 00:49:22,600
Swiftly changing the subject over to Castlevania, let's talk about Castlevania.

725
00:49:22,600 --> 00:49:25,320
I think this is kind of interesting.

726
00:49:25,320 --> 00:49:29,160
for no real reason is going to be packaging Aria of Sorrow and Harmony of

727
00:49:29,160 --> 00:49:33,200
Dissonance together into one game and that will be coming out the first quarter

728
00:49:33,200 --> 00:49:37,280
of 2006 and there's no real reason why they're doing it they're not really

729
00:49:37,280 --> 00:49:41,880
adding anything to these games I think they're doing this because cap DS is

730
00:49:41,880 --> 00:49:45,080
selling so freaking huge and so they want to kind of capitalize on a little

731
00:49:45,080 --> 00:49:51,120
step all the time those two would still sell separately on their own except I

732
00:49:51,120 --> 00:49:54,560
don't think they make either one anymore I didn't already have them I know it's

733
00:49:54,560 --> 00:49:55,560
That's kinda how I feel.

734
00:49:55,560 --> 00:49:56,560
Alright.

735
00:49:56,560 --> 00:49:57,560
Um.

736
00:49:57,560 --> 00:50:02,080
Jamie, you have a story about another racing game, we've been talking about Project Gotham

737
00:50:02,080 --> 00:50:04,800
and all this other stuff, but you have a racing game that sounds pretty hot.

738
00:50:04,800 --> 00:50:05,800
No, no, no.

739
00:50:05,800 --> 00:50:07,680
Best racing game series ever.

740
00:50:07,680 --> 00:50:08,680
Outrun.

741
00:50:08,680 --> 00:50:09,680
Woohoo.

742
00:50:09,680 --> 00:50:16,160
Cause, you know, at my house, and you've seen at my house, classic Sega horror house.

743
00:50:16,160 --> 00:50:18,160
That didn't sound too right.

744
00:50:18,160 --> 00:50:19,160
Anyway.

745
00:50:19,160 --> 00:50:20,440
I digress.

746
00:50:20,440 --> 00:50:25,440
Sega has announced Outrun 2006, and we all cheer, yay!

747
00:50:25,440 --> 00:50:26,440
Um, Outrun...

748
00:50:26,440 --> 00:50:27,440
Yay!

749
00:50:27,440 --> 00:50:34,040
Um, basically, um, Sega's confirmed Outrun 2006 Coast to Coast will be released March

750
00:50:34,040 --> 00:50:39,440
2006 on the PS2, PSP, and PC, but guess what, not on...

751
00:50:39,440 --> 00:50:40,440
Arcade!

752
00:50:40,440 --> 00:50:41,440
Xbox!

753
00:50:41,440 --> 00:50:42,440
Hm.

754
00:50:42,440 --> 00:50:43,440
And no arcade.

755
00:50:43,440 --> 00:50:44,440
I didn't see...

756
00:50:44,440 --> 00:50:51,800
It's going to be 30 stages, the best of both Outrun 2 and Outrun 2 SP, mission structure,

757
00:50:51,800 --> 00:50:58,720
license mode, 6 player online, total of 12 licensed Ferraris, including the F430 and

758
00:50:58,720 --> 00:50:59,720
Super America.

759
00:50:59,720 --> 00:51:02,660
Well, you said something about Outrun 2 and previous Outruns, they're not just repackaging

760
00:51:02,660 --> 00:51:03,660
the same crap, right?

761
00:51:03,660 --> 00:51:07,400
They're going to give it a facelift and everything, bring it to the next gen, right?

762
00:51:07,400 --> 00:51:08,400
That's what it sounds like.

763
00:51:08,400 --> 00:51:10,400
They have to think better.

764
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:22,400
Also, it says PSP owners who also have the PS2 version will be able to access exclusive content by hooking them up with a USB cable. Finally a use!

765
00:51:22,400 --> 00:51:25,400
They actually do that with a lot of games.

766
00:51:25,400 --> 00:51:26,400
Really?

767
00:51:26,400 --> 00:51:33,400
Well, at any rate, it's being put out in development by Sumo Digital. They actually were the ones who ported Outrun 2 to Xbox.

768
00:51:33,400 --> 00:51:44,400
Like WWE, Smackdown vs. Raw 6, SoCalm, Fireteam Bravo, and SoCalm 3, uh, Madden.

769
00:51:44,400 --> 00:51:49,400
Alright, Loki I'm about out of stuff, what else you got for us tonight?

770
00:51:49,400 --> 00:51:52,400
I know you had something on like Metal Gear or something in a pretty cool hack.

771
00:51:52,400 --> 00:51:54,400
Metal Gear?

772
00:51:54,400 --> 00:51:57,400
Didn't you say you had something about Metal Gear Acid 2 or something?

773
00:51:57,400 --> 00:51:59,400
Oh no, yeah Metal Gear Acid 2.

774
00:51:59,400 --> 00:52:08,400
It's actually quite funny, is they found out one of the things that's actually featured in the game, because someone of course dumped the ROM for it, and they discovered videos of...

775
00:52:08,400 --> 00:52:09,400
Wait, is the game out?

776
00:52:09,400 --> 00:52:10,400
Yeah, in Japan.

777
00:52:10,400 --> 00:52:11,400
Oh, okay.

778
00:52:11,400 --> 00:52:18,400
Of scantily clad women for use with that special viewing device that they have, the solid eye.

779
00:52:18,400 --> 00:52:27,400
So you get 3D video of scantily clad women, as well as a trailer for Rebel Roses X-X, which is kinda cool.

780
00:52:27,400 --> 00:52:28,400
Hot.

781
00:52:28,400 --> 00:52:38,120
In other news, this is called, it's bound to happen sooner or later, the first 360 game

782
00:52:38,120 --> 00:52:45,480
has been dumped to a hard drive, a group going by the name of Pi has released a 360 dump

783
00:52:45,480 --> 00:52:50,400
extract tool, they were able to rip apart the games to extract them to their PC's hard

784
00:52:50,400 --> 00:52:51,400
drive.

785
00:52:51,400 --> 00:52:54,000
Gideon the Royal on the other hand, that's another story, but still

786
00:52:55,160 --> 00:52:58,000
One small step for hackers. Yeah

787
00:52:58,960 --> 00:53:01,680
One giant forget it. I don't know anyways

788
00:53:02,840 --> 00:53:07,480
So that was interesting speaking more hacking stuff this guy actually

789
00:53:08,480 --> 00:53:10,480
going by the name of

790
00:53:11,480 --> 00:53:13,120
Parasite has

791
00:53:13,120 --> 00:53:17,640
Shown that you can hack levels into your online Wi-Fi

792
00:53:17,640 --> 00:53:24,640
for Mario Kart DS, and he's been able to play such levels as the TikTok Clock and other stuff.

793
00:53:24,640 --> 00:53:31,640
I don't think they've released how they've done this yet, but it has been shown that people have been doing it online.

794
00:53:31,640 --> 00:53:38,640
Kind of interesting, some of the levels kind of glitch out a little bit, but, you know, interesting.

795
00:53:38,640 --> 00:53:41,640
Interesting. Now, Jamie, what were you talking about a little bit before the show?

796
00:53:41,640 --> 00:53:44,640
Somebody had sent us an email about another Mario hack that was done.

797
00:53:44,640 --> 00:53:46,640
Yeah this was actually the other email I meant to read.

798
00:53:46,640 --> 00:53:47,640
Oh that's alright.

799
00:53:47,640 --> 00:53:49,640
Before I get to that there's actually a question for Logie.

800
00:53:49,640 --> 00:53:50,640
Oh sure.

801
00:53:50,640 --> 00:53:51,640
Okay.

802
00:53:51,640 --> 00:54:07,640
One of our writers, Sisbon, I say writers, our listeners, he said he's finished a bunch of missions in GTA, LCS for PSP and the only one left available is the booby prize bike race. Any tips for winning?

803
00:54:07,640 --> 00:54:15,640
I don't know. I didn't actually finish the game or play many of the missions. I just put a 100% code in to get all the characters for-

804
00:54:15,640 --> 00:54:16,640
Cheater!

805
00:54:16,640 --> 00:54:23,640
Well, here's what. I only play it for multiplayer. That's all I play the game for now, so I don't actually play three of the missions and stuff.

806
00:54:23,640 --> 00:54:26,640
So I just wanted to have all the characters unlocked and everything.

807
00:54:26,640 --> 00:54:28,640
I can't point fingers because I'm cheating at Silent Hill 3.

808
00:54:28,640 --> 00:54:31,640
You're going to have to go to game FAQs, my friend. Sorry.

809
00:54:31,640 --> 00:54:34,640
Yeah, Game Facts would be a good place to check.

810
00:54:34,640 --> 00:54:38,640
But I did send a very interesting link at themushroomkingdom.net

811
00:54:38,640 --> 00:54:42,640
It's the Super Mario Bros. 3 their lost levels

812
00:54:42,640 --> 00:54:46,640
I'll just read the first paragraph from that page

813
00:54:46,640 --> 00:54:50,640
Deep within Super Mario Bros. 3 lie hidden unused levels. Some of them seem polished

814
00:54:50,640 --> 00:54:54,640
with working goals and plenty of enemies, while others are devoid of enemies, lacking exits

815
00:54:54,640 --> 00:54:58,640
or too short to be full levels. There's actually a couple of pictures

816
00:54:58,640 --> 00:55:02,640
of them. One of them uses the boot. I love the boot.

817
00:55:02,640 --> 00:55:07,200
level in the actual game used the boot and it was so short and the boot was cool but

818
00:55:07,200 --> 00:55:11,520
it's pretty cool because the level maps are up on the page I'd say people should

819
00:55:11,520 --> 00:55:15,120
check it out if you're an old-school Super Mario Brothers player but you know

820
00:55:15,120 --> 00:55:18,880
that actually goes back into what we were saying there's always unused code

821
00:55:18,880 --> 00:55:24,480
in games yeah I mean this could have easily been Mario hot coffee where Mario

822
00:55:24,480 --> 00:55:33,000
the princess get it on another castle another castle another castle like some

823
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:40,440
of these just a little short nothing special little blips of it but you just

824
00:55:40,440 --> 00:55:44,120
need to unlock something like that of a game that's been out right like God how

825
00:55:44,120 --> 00:55:50,680
long is a game now like 15 years or so it's not more 17 oh my god anyone think

826
00:55:50,680 --> 00:56:01,680
about it. That dates me. Anyway, um, anything else DarkSakura? No, I'm not. No. Loki, anything

827
00:56:01,680 --> 00:56:08,860
else? I just have one more, and that's, uh, this product has been released, uh, basically

828
00:56:08,860 --> 00:56:15,920
it's on this website, gameback-web.com, it's in their web store, it's called the PSP Bank,

829
00:56:15,920 --> 00:56:19,760
It's basically a 40GB hard drive for the PSP.

830
00:56:19,760 --> 00:56:26,080
What it looks actually to be is a hard drive that has a USB on the go, so you can actually

831
00:56:26,080 --> 00:56:28,520
transfer stuff between the hard drive and the PSP.

832
00:56:28,520 --> 00:56:33,760
However, you can't actually just access the entire hard drive using the PSP.

833
00:56:33,760 --> 00:56:37,760
So not quite cool, but a step in the right direction I guess.

834
00:56:37,760 --> 00:56:44,000
And also, there was another development here which is quite interesting.

835
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:51,580
The guy that's basically behind, whoa what was it here, who's behind the cheat device

836
00:56:51,580 --> 00:56:58,340
for Grand Theft Auto, or they think it's actually done the same way, basically working on running

837
00:56:58,340 --> 00:57:07,060
firmware on 2.01 and 2.5 firmwares, maybe 2.6, running the homebrew stuff.

838
00:57:07,060 --> 00:57:12,860
So it's being worked on and probably be cracked soon, no surprise.

839
00:57:12,860 --> 00:57:16,720
One more story I got for you guys and that has to do, I knew Jamie would get a kick out

840
00:57:16,720 --> 00:57:17,720
of this one.

841
00:57:17,720 --> 00:57:23,100
I went to Slashdot earlier this week and I saw this and I totally thought of you, Jamie.

842
00:57:23,100 --> 00:57:26,460
The headline is, Gamers Better at Driving with Cell Phones?

843
00:57:26,460 --> 00:57:28,900
Okay, you know what?

844
00:57:28,900 --> 00:57:31,860
Hold on, I haven't read it yet.

845
00:57:31,860 --> 00:57:37,060
Let's see, the psychologists who are studying multitasking have argued for years about these

846
00:57:37,060 --> 00:57:39,660
information bottlenecks and they want to know why this occurs.

847
00:57:39,660 --> 00:57:43,260
Is it because people are lazy, because they have an inability to switch from one task

848
00:57:43,260 --> 00:57:44,260
to another?

849
00:57:44,260 --> 00:57:45,260
Who knows?

850
00:57:45,260 --> 00:57:50,220
But this Mei-Cheng Lin, who is an assistant professor of psychology at Oregon State University

851
00:57:50,220 --> 00:57:57,460
said, even with a seemingly simple task, structural cognitive limitations can prevent you from

852
00:57:57,460 --> 00:57:59,420
efficiently switching to a new task.

853
00:57:59,420 --> 00:58:03,900
I have to say that the best ones are those who play a lot of video games, she pointed

854
00:58:03,900 --> 00:58:04,980
out.

855
00:58:04,980 --> 00:58:08,700
Those are lab studies, however, not driving tests.

856
00:58:08,700 --> 00:58:12,480
So because you play video games, you're good at multitasking, so therefore gamers, get

857
00:58:12,480 --> 00:58:16,080
out on the road and start throwing those headsets away because you can multitask.

858
00:58:16,080 --> 00:58:21,560
I've said it once, I've said it a bajillion times, and somebody in this room is included

859
00:58:21,560 --> 00:58:27,120
in that, if you drive and talk on your cell phone, you are being a big dumb butt!

860
00:58:27,120 --> 00:58:30,000
You're endangering your life and those of other people.

861
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:31,960
I'm multitasking, what can I say?

862
00:58:31,960 --> 00:58:34,520
Actually it's impossible to multitask.

863
00:58:34,520 --> 00:58:38,280
I can multitask, I'm a good driver.

864
00:58:38,280 --> 00:58:44,340
thoughts low key your final thought I want to get better my final thought is

865
00:58:44,340 --> 00:58:50,700
I hate being sick dark soccer um I'm tired of having the plague I've been sick

866
00:58:50,700 --> 00:58:56,200
since November 4th I don't think I'm ever gonna get better well that's a

867
