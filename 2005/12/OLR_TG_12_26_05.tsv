469	2549	Orange Lounge Radio To Go Edition, a week of December 26th, 2005.
2669	13692	You're tuned in to the Orange Lounge Radio To Go Edition, your podcast home for all the latest video game news and gamer chat.
13972	17752	Now, here are your hosts, DarkSakura, Sky, and Loki.
19793	21773	Ho, ho, ho, everybody.
23093	24914	Welcome to Orange Lounge Radio To Go.
25734	26694	Hope you had a great holiday.
27878	28338	Choke, choke, gasp
52990	55332	What, did you get coal in your stocking this year again?
55652	57073	Actually, I did get coal in my stocking.
57153	57573	Awesome.
57913	59314	That was from me.
59374	60475	No, actually, it was from Dan.
60955	64137	It was in a little tin box that said lump of coal, and it did have a lump of coal in it.
65538	66359	Is that all he got you?
66579	70822	No, I got the most romantic gift of Dawn of the Dead.
71282	71622	Cool.
72323	76866	And Serenity, of course, and a $500 car stereo and speakers.
77086	77506	Nice.
78547	78967	Nice.
79047	80188	What did Dan get me for Christmas?
81029	81649	A kick in the butt.
82077	82717	All right.
82777	84518	Over there in the corner is the one and only Loki.
85378	85698	Hello.
86098	86578	How you doing?
87019	87579	I'm okay.
87819	88119	All right.
89079	92580	What'd you do for the Christmas day or holiday or whatever?
92600	93581	I hung out with family.
93681	95381	That's pretty much it, yeah.
95541	96221	Did you get anything?
96261	96762	Get some loot?
96882	97962	I got salami.
100063	101503	What an awesome present!
101583	102903	I don't think that's a game.
102943	104404	I haven't heard of salami.
104961	105462	Thanks for watching!
123223	125484	Help the Swiss Miss, save her supply of beef sticks.
125504	135449	No one gets me games for Christmas because they know that I, for one, I do work at a company that sells games, and I get tons of games anyways, and then I buy whatever I want.
136309	137450	Good point.
137510	138070	It makes it tough.
138611	139371	Good point, good point.
140069	144031	Alright, well, of course, happy holidays from us here at Orange Lounge Radio to you guys.
144271	146713	And we are a day late this week because of the holidays.
146753	147553	You know, give us a break.
147913	149654	We're entitled to a vacation every once in a while.
150155	152216	But we're here doing the show for you guys tonight.
152336	153516	I was actually playing a game.
154937	157459	Well, what a good segue into how was your gaming week?
157899	158779	DarkSakura, what did you play?
158919	159880	Trivial Pursuits.
161880	162961	Was that on a console?
162981	170945	No, we did Couples Trivial Pursuits, me and Dan and his cousins and significant others and wives and things.
170985	172486	This is not a board game podcast.
172506	176128	There are some board game podcasts out there, of which we are not one.
176428	178990	So what kind of console or computer games were you playing?
179070	185093	I started Papa Lacrosse, then Dan took the PSP away from me, which I was very upset with.
186738	191460	Yeah, I found my game sitting on my computer desk and the PSP was gone.
192080	193001	I was like, well, great.
193701	195262	So I've been playing a lot of Animal Crossing.
196282	196723	Very cool.
198623	201105	And I finally got to see Need for Speed Underground on...
202773	204454	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
233222	235363	Just the cop chases were awesome on it.
236803	237143	That's it?
239144	239784	For now.
240104	242425	Alright, well, meow, Miss Thing, alright.
244546	247006	Somebody woke up on the wrong side of the sleigh, what's going on?
247707	248747	Maybe under the sleigh.
248867	251768	Alright, uh, Loki, how was your gaming week?
252168	255989	I just played a lot of multiplayer games, you know, typical work stuff.
256369	260511	Grand Theft Auto Liberty's safe story is that we actually have our six-man teams now, so...
262630	264532	It's really dense.
264652	267213	There's tons of people running around in that game, which is fun.
267554	269995	And it makes it really challenging.
270676	273278	But, I don't know.
273338	274358	Other people are getting better now.
274638	277020	So it's giving me more of a challenge, which is good.
277340	281523	And then Call of Duty 2, we've been playing multiplayer during lunch, which is really cool.
281883	285266	And I actually need to play the single player version of the game because it would be really nice.
285686	291410	And then, of course, Animal Crossing Wild World, we've been playing almost every day now.
292922	296344	I don't know, it's a real easy game to pick up, play for like 10 minutes and put down.
296924	298125	So that's why I kind of like it.
298805	302086	And I don't have to play it every day like friggin' Nintendogs.
302626	306808	Which I might add, I haven't played in a long time thinking about selling my last copy too.
306828	307949	Oh wow.
309229	312991	My puppies are probably flea ridden and rabid by now.
313747	317430	I was worried that Animal Crossing was going to turn out the same way as Nintendogs.
317510	320072	Now that the game's been out for a little while, what do you think?
320292	322794	Is this something you're going to still be playing six months from now?
324295	328998	I'm sure I'll get tired of it after a while, because six months, there's a lot of good games that are going to come out between then.
329499	333922	But it is going to be a game that I'll be playing for at least another couple months, for sure.
336187	339948	I know, I played the GameCube one all year just to get all the stuff.
340068	341728	Except I don't know that holidays are in this one.
342128	343689	Because the Japanese version didn't have holidays.
344549	345949	There's different holidays.
345989	348310	There's politically correct holidays.
349250	349850	So retarded.
349870	355592	I love the festive candle that was in there, which is the menorah and the festive tree, you know, Christmas tree.
358152	360153	But, you know, it was...
361926	369169	Nevermind, Foamy the Squirrel said it all for me, so I'll just let... I'll direct people to the recent Foamy the Squirrel Christmas thing.
369509	371330	Yeah, that's how I feel about it.
371770	372790	Alright, check it out.
374131	374431	Is that it?
374671	375572	Anything else you want to add, Loki?
375672	377012	That's pretty much it, yeah.
377092	388537	My gaming week was pretty uneventful, honestly, because I didn't really get a whole lot of new stuff, so I've been basically, as promised last week, Final Fantasy IV Advance has been taking up a lot of my time.
389898	390038	And...
391425	394526	I also was playing Animal Crossing for a little bit and checking out some other stuff.
394566	399448	So I decided I wanted to get into something new but there wasn't a whole lot of new games that were out that I wanted.
400028	406410	So I've been seeing commercials on TV and looking around the internet lately and I've heard a lot about this service GameTap.
406830	408231	I don't know if you guys out there have heard of this.
408291	414573	GameTap is this thing where you can like play I think something like 300 games is what they boast in their category.
414973	415893	300 games on demand.
415953	417514	It's like an on demand gaming service.
418114	420395	It's a very interesting business model because it's
421095	431741	Setup basically so that you pay a monthly service fee, which is right now I think they're running a special where it's a two-week free trial and a $9.95 a month for 12 months.
432641	437664	But I think normally it's about $14.95 a month is what they charge, so I'm not sure how long their special's running for.
438504	446088	But what I think is interesting is that they say, hey, this is how much you'd pay for WoW or other comparable MMOs, so I thought that was kind of an interesting way to plug it.
447149	450631	But of course the games that are accessible in the library are older games, but
451428	451888	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
470350	471992	Namco Games are actually in the GameTap.
472032	482201	GameTap has contracts or some type of agreement with many game publishing companies such as I noticed Sega, Activision, Sierra, and Namco.
482702	488707	Not that all the games from these companies are in the library, but a few of their notable ones like Pac-Man's in the library, Dig Dugs, those type of things.
490347	499857	But what's interesting also, not every game, you know, Nintendo, you're not going to see anything by Nintendo in here, but the GameTab library has all these different areas.
499877	504242	You can either sort it by genre, you can sort it by the system, which I thought was very interesting.
504302	507826	I did not realize when I first downloaded it that they actually had Dreamcast games in there.
508226	509186	There's not very many.
509206	511027	There's only three Dreamcast games available.
511267	513407	I remember Hydro Thunder, Mr. Driller are both in there.
514128	520669	But I thought it was very interesting that, you know, Dreamcast isn't that old, all things considered, so it was kind of neat to see that in there.
521249	524150	And they also have some relatively recent PC games in there, some of the Tomb Raider games.
525390	527171	Oops, sorry, my mic's going in now.
527631	531472	Some of the Tomb Raider games, Tom Clancy games are in there.
533885	534506	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
558218	560379	And in a way, like, okay, think about iTunes.
560439	561159	What does it allow you to do?
561199	563520	It allows you to download music legally, right?
563660	570603	But a lot of people just download their music from, what are the services out there now?
570803	574604	With a closed WinMX, they got what, what's the underground stuff out there?
574644	578486	BitTorrent, or, you know, you could download songs off of there, but
579133	579654	DarkSakura,
590558	595181	What's interesting about GameTap is it's almost like that, but now we're talking about like abandonware and emulation.
595762	602386	And I think this is the first time, and I would say it's kind of taken the industry long enough, with the exception of these retro packs and things.
602406	617656	This is really the first time that I can recall seeing like a PC kind of trying to legalize the abandonware and emulation scene, which could be bad news for those people because as this gets more and more prevalent, you know, I think they're going to go after those types of sites, the ones that they haven't already.
618257	618617	But you know,
619781	620403	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
627156	629617	So interface is very sleek.
629757	635259	Games download pretty quickly unless you're playing like a newer game that was originally on CD.
636259	638620	Like I played Mr. Driller on Dreamcast.
638680	640141	It took like 11 minutes to download.
640621	642902	But you can play other games in the background.
642922	645082	Like while that's downloading, I can play something on Atari 2600.
645142	651945	And what I also thought was very interesting about GameTap, and this is something I don't think a lot of people are mentioning, is that
653263	657785	GameTap is owned by Turner Broadcasting, which owns a lot of television stations.
658305	662227	And so they produce their own programming for this GameTap service.
662527	666748	One of the things they push is this MediaPlex that has their own little channels.
666768	672170	They have a reality show to pick the next GJ, as they're calling it, like a game jockey or whatever.
672711	674331	Cheesy, but OK, whatever.
675232	680134	And then they also have these little commercials that play while you're waiting to download the games.
681753	688577	and they kind of show like, you know, like a Dig Dug short funny thing or Pac-Man or whatever.
688597	689318	What was the other one I saw?
689338	691279	Like Galaxian or there's other stuff in there.
691779	700765	So what I thought was kind of neat about that is that a lot of the stuff I was seeing on GameTap is probably better than anything I've seen on G4 TV the past year.
701805	705427	So that kind of makes me go, hmm, very interesting.
705467	709490	And you know, if there's anybody from GameTap out there listening by chance, seriously,
710501	713263	I'm pretty impressed with what you guys are doing programming-wise.
713683	715884	And I'm like, why don't you guys start a station?
715904	733354	Because I don't know if you guys are aware right now, but gamers are pretty much being robbed very slowly of the only representation we pretty much had on TV, which was G4, which, you know, bought Tech TV and then now is, you know, replacing their shows like Filter and G4TV.com with repeats of The Man Show and repeats of Fastlane.
734035	737437	Okay, people, no one watched Fastlane the first time for a reason, okay?
739349	741910	I want to know why they're showing Star Trek The Next Generation.
742130	743530	Yeah, and now that too.
743630	745171	It's like, WTF, people?
745391	748712	Star Trek The Next Generation, they've become Spike now?
748812	750412	They're Spike for kids is what they're turning into.
750432	751532	But anyway, this is about GameTap.
751933	759095	So I'm pretty impressed because it seems like, you know what, the people at GameTap seem to know what they're doing, unlike the folks at G4.
759495	767157	So if this is promising that they might try to do a station, I think it would be really neat to see.
767597	767757	So...
768770	772892	As a gamer who feels underrepresented on the cable box right now, I think that's very interesting.
773212	775734	And GameTap, you know, that would be a good name for a station anyway.
775754	777294	Hmm, things to consider.
778155	779736	Anyway, so that's cool.
779756	780236	I like the media.
780256	780776	That's a big plus.
781557	784558	The service itself, you know, it does have some issues now.
784598	785759	I had some graphical glitches.
786159	790521	I have had the system lock up completely when some of the video tries to download.
790901	795284	I don't know if that's my system specifically or if that's, you know, maybe more people are going to have problems with that.
795404	795764	I don't know.
796304	801626	But anyway, I do recommend GameTap, especially if you're a fan of retro gaming things.
802927	804027	It's a two-week free trial.
804387	805048	Check it out.
805128	805648	Why not?
806448	807088	It's pretty cool.
807649	815892	I think it's one of those things that's going to get better with time, because it's still in the early stages, and I know they recently signed deals with Capcom and some other publishers as well, and I think I read something.
815912	818773	They want to grow to like 1,000 games by this time in a year or so.
819522	819602	Loki,
848550	849051	It looked good.
850112	850572	I like it.
851233	862864	Even something really cool if it was on a set-top console thing, like if they could come out with some sort of really bare-bones wireless controller thing, kind of like the Phantom.
862884	865067	They were talking about doing all streaming.
866428	868990	That model could work, except the Phantom sucks, but...
870424	879046	I don't know, it looks good though, I mean, it's definitely something worth checking out, especially if you've got, definitely want some controllers or something for your PC, you know.
879787	889509	Yeah, that's my other complaint, but that's not GameTap's fault, is that my controller sucks, so it's not, I mean, it is neat that GameTap, you know, picked it right up and knew what kind of controller I had, but it sucks.
889769	891510	I need to get something better if I want to use a controller.
891752	893473	But still, though, I mean, it looks good.
893673	895213	And I like the way the interface was.
895313	896274	That was really cool, actually.
896414	903617	Now, as somebody who often reports on this program about what's going on underground, would you actually pay for something like GameTap?
904557	905217	Uh, no.
905417	913461	Because I don't have enough time to actually sit there and go play a lot of games online, let alone pay $9.95 a month for something.
913761	917662	I mean, look, I still subscribe to Final Fantasy XI.
917702	918363	God knows why.
918383	919923	I haven't played the game in, like, six months.
920444	921104	But, um...
922148	924349	Sure, I don't know, I guess.
924389	928252	I think that's going to be most people's sticking point with GameTap is that there's not a lot of new stuff on there.
928272	931694	So if you want to play the new cutting edge stuff, GameTap's probably not for you.
932374	933695	GameTap's more of like a library.
933715	937897	But it shows potential and maybe, who knows, companies might pick up on this model.
938878	946783	The other thing I wanted to say before we get into the news, I'm sorry to spend so much time on this, because this really made me think about this, the whole GameTap thing, is it really made me think about
947543	949989	I bet you anything this is how Nintendo Revolution is going to be set up.
950069	958327	I bet you Nintendo Revolution with its old Nintendo classics, because when I started not seeing the Nintendo games in GameTap, I thought, you know what, Nintendo Revolution, I bet you this is going to be the same model.
958914	965159	Choose your console, choose $9.95 a month, $14.95 a month, whatever they're going to charge, and then the unlimited play of the old Nintendo games.
965420	967822	I bet you anything, Revolution's going to have the same business model.
967922	984015	Or they could just do something very similar to Xbox Live, where you have the silver, which doesn't allow you to play the old games or whatever, and then you can pay the gold, which is $9.95, you get all the old games from all the systems, plus whatever other crap that they throw on there as well for download.
984375	984535	Yeah.
984776	984916	Hmm.
985256	985777	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
997586	1006411	Microsoft, of course, has been shipping out a little more and more now, and they're saying that they're going to start doing these weekly shipments, but, you know, a lot of people still say, you know, don't hold your breath.
1006731	1011593	If you didn't pre-order, you're still not getting one of these until March, if you're an EB Games or GameStop shopper.
1012994	1021238	Local magazine, or not magazine, newspaper, San Jose Mercury News actually said, Microsoft is disappointed that it can't get more units of the Xbox 360 into the market.
1021558	1025340	So that's, you know, Microsoft has that regret there, so I don't know what
1025860	1027721	What that's about, because you'd think they'd do something about it.
1028001	1039347	But anyway, what's interesting is that the reporter from the San Jose Mercury News, Dean Takahashi, also said in his personal blog, various folks tell me that the shortage isn't a problem with chip yields.
1039847	1041328	I think it's more of a systems issue.
1041428	1044670	When the boxes come together, they're working on getting more units out.
1045549	1050591	So this guy's saying that maybe it's not the chip shortage, it's the fact they just can't package them fast enough.
1050991	1053551	Which is a little disappointing, if that's really it.
1053892	1056192	Because you think they would have gotten the resources for that.
1056212	1062654	I think they might be afraid that they're running into these glitches that people are running into now with the overheating and stuff.
1062674	1065995	They're trying to get more working units that don't have these same problems.
1066976	1067656	That could be it.
1067816	1071197	And so, you know, comes down to a quality control problem or something.
1072344	1074785	DarkSakura, you have another story about the shipment of Xbox 360s.
1075005	1075125	Um, oh...
1098121	1114677	Well, there's a bit of word out because they were checking about Microsoft UK as far as if they were going to get their shipments out, and they said that they're actually on track to meet their 90-day forecast that they had out of 2.75 to 3 million units to go out.
1116719	1120263	As far as the US shipment is concerned,
1120883	1126526	There's a quote that I found that says they're working around the clock to deliver as many Xbox 360 consoles as humanly possible.
1127126	1134650	There is, though, a pretty rampant disappointment throughout Microsoft US about how low the shipments have been.
1135470	1138212	I still think it's purposeful, but...
1139398	1140439	We'll see, we'll see.
1140699	1142281	Now, Loki, you have a story also.
1142361	1144344	Actually, there's one more thing about that.
1144724	1156879	Actually, it was asked about that and said that there was any, Microsoft's competitors are actually even thinking that they're legitimate, that the shortage is legitimate.
1157379	1161084	The quote from Sony's Phil Harrison says that, I don't believe that for a second.
1161164	1167992	I think that it's clear that they're making every unit that they can, whether that is enough for demand or that they can't make enough is a question you'll have to put to Microsoft.
1168052	1169654	But it's definitely not done on purpose.
1169894	1172737	That's interesting little support from the competition there.
1172938	1173218	Yeah.
1173358	1173899	Very interesting.
1174315	1178117	Loki, you have some news relating to the Xbox Live Diamond account now?
1178157	1180198	There's silver, gold, and diamond now?
1180258	1181959	Well, it's a diamond card.
1182019	1184781	It's not necessarily anything that you have to pay for.
1184801	1192385	If you have an Xbox Live Gold membership, you can actually subscribe using your Gamertag to this diamond card.
1192545	1197488	It's basically this little card that you get that has this cool little graphics on there plus your Gamertag.
1198048	1202950	and they have a bunch of affiliates with Microsoft that are offering discounts for it.
1202970	1205050	So it's kind of like one of those discount cards that you get.
1205490	1216534	So basically if you go to Xbox, I believe it's XboxLiveDiamondCard.com Let me see here real quick.
1216994	1219575	It's XboxLiveDiamond.com, that's what it was.
1220575	1226777	You go there, you put your gamer tag in and you sign up and they'll basically ship it to your address that you have signed up with.
1227970	1230575	What if you have an Xbox regular live account?
1231316	1231717	No dice?
1231897	1232518	Or can you still get it?
1232719	1232919	Nope.
1233600	1234262	Ah, sucks!
1235660	1236561	Give it the times, folks.
1237461	1244806	Anyways, no, but some of the actual affiliates that they have right now, they're talking about, like, McDonald's.
1245686	1249189	I saw, what was it, like, Carl's Jr., Burger King type stuff on there.
1250189	1253571	I know as well... Just what a gamer needs, fast food discounts.
1253611	1254272	Yeah, exactly.
1254292	1258014	How about getting some fresh choice discounts in there?
1258114	1260416	Hey, yo, hey, no, no, no.
1260456	1263397	They've got, like, for example, and this is actually on the website, they have...
1264794	1269197	Hollywood Video, you rent a movie or video game, get the second rental free.
1269297	1271839	Sam Goody, 10% off of DVDs and CDs.
1271899	1276222	Quiznos, buy a sandwich, get the second one free.
1277442	1279644	50% off of Cambridge Soundworks speakers.
1279664	1284127	20% off of Etnies shoes.
1284587	1286468	This is a big list of stuff.
1290011	1290611	Sorry, microphone.
1290948	1293269	I'm going over to DarkSakura because maybe she'll back me up on this.
1293329	1297851	Is it just me or could Xbox be the moralist here and offer discounts for 24-hour fitness?
1300012	1306614	I wish they would, but they're going to cater to... Sorry, the typical gamer.
1306854	1314297	I hate to say it, but I don't know many average gamers who are into fitness and health.
1314357	1316178	I mean, I know lots who are, yeah, but...
1316946	1320147	You know, if you think about your average, say, your college... What's the stereotype?
1320647	1322168	The stereotype, like the college frat boy.
1324328	1324508	No.
1326109	1330710	And on top of that, honestly, promoting a lazy lifestyle helps their business.
1332170	1332510	Loki.
1332711	1336031	Honestly, which has Wi-Fi for the DS?
1336692	1338172	McDonald's or Fresh Choice?
1339112	1339833	I make my point.
1339933	1342253	I'm not going to... Fresh Choice is only in California.
1342593	1344954	Oops, sorry, I made a regional joke.
1346158	1347218	I'm sorry, what, Jamba Juice?
1347258	1347859	Is that nationwide?
1347879	1349339	That's borderline healthy.
1349679	1352520	They don't have Jamba Juice in my part of Alabama.
1352680	1353460	Ah, forget it then.
1354841	1356021	So you know what they need to have?
1356261	1356461	What?
1357301	1362143	It's like they have the life fitness bikes that you can watch TV or listen to your CD player on.
1362603	1369585	They need to have one with like an Xbox 360 hooked up to it so it will shut down if you stop pedaling.
1370365	1370825	There you go.
1371185	1373586	Or if you pedal too fast and it gets too hot.
1376073	1376413	Lame.
1376774	1380496	Alright, Loki, speaking of Xbox 360, what the hell's going on with Dead or Alive 4?
1381557	1383959	It's actually been delayed again.
1383979	1384559	Surprise!
1385059	1385960	Only a couple more days.
1386540	1387121	It's actually...
1387762	1395484	The people that have been reviewing the final copy, which is supposedly going gold here pretty soon, actually gave it 100%, you know, out of 100.
1395624	1397344	Just a really good game.
1397664	1405205	They're basically working on the online, make sure it's very balanced, and they just want to make sure the game's good before it goes out.
1405626	1410326	And supposedly now the new date is January 2nd, and it's going to be the new ship date on it.
1410447	1412127	So expect it in stores around the 3rd.
1413390	1413910	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1438599	1439140	That is it.
1439200	1440862	Oh god, we covered that in a previous show.
1440883	1441563	That is it.
1441924	1442285	Nothing.
1442365	1442645	Nada.
1443006	1446751	And now we're just talking about Dead or Alive 4 for this next week.
1447051	1451938	Only game coming out on the consoles and then the next week there's a couple games and then that's it.
1451958	1453681	Then your next big game is going to be 25 to Life.
1454912	1457934	And then Jamie, you were saying that UK's lineup looks pretty similar.
1458134	1459616	It's pretty much a ghost town for a little while.
1459816	1460096	Yeah.
1460676	1464559	So after the next big, you know, sell period comes up.
1464740	1464960	Yeah.
1465380	1465680	All right.
1466141	1466461	Interesting.
1467241	1467602	All right.
1467822	1469523	Let's do some console balance here.
1469563	1470524	We've talked enough about Xbox 360.
1470564	1472305	Let's talk a little bit about PS3.
1472345	1476909	I know DarkSakura has a story about finally we know, like, a game that might be coming to PS3.
1476929	1477029	Yeah.
1479312	1485016	Actually, Unreal Tournament 2007 is coming out for the PlayStation 3 and it's set in Spring 2006.
1485496	1490460	I think the date is almost more interesting than the announcement of the game itself.
1490580	1491180	That's great.
1491460	1492801	Yeah, it's actually pretty cool.
1493121	1496464	I mean, I don't think it's too surprising that it's going to be on PlayStation 3.
1497624	1502908	But just the... I mean, honestly, to be out so quickly...
1504437	1506379	That's surprising to me, but actually I'm not so surprised.
1506679	1514644	I mean, I am a little bit surprised by the fact that it's coming on PS3 because when I think about Unreal Tournament previous games, I think of Xbox.
1514824	1519287	But maybe that's just because that's where I owned Unreal before I sold it back finally because I was bored of it.
1519667	1523170	But, you know, I kind of always thought of it as an Xbox title, but yeah.
1524741	1536365	Well, I have a feeling that we're going to see it on Xbox 360, but just that it's going to be, I'm just sort of, the whole announcement together is sort of like the, whoa.
1537505	1548609	Well, they could do Grand Theft Auto San Andreas where they put it out on one console exclusively for, you know, X amount of months, nine months or whatever, and then they bring it out on the other systems later.
1550889	1567053	Now, I have a story about Nintendo Revolution, and that actually has to do with Zelda Twilight Princess, is that in a Nintendo magazine released in Europe, it's actually NGC, in their January 2006 issue, they're saying that Twilight Princess is going to be using the Revolution controller.
1567953	1572795	There's a quote here, our development team has decided to take extra time to add some incredible elements.
1573815	1578056	There were elements that Miyamoto said were simply far too good to leave out.
1578800	1586263	So, you know, we kind of heard about the delays the first time being the fact that they're going to add something Revolution special here.
1586283	1588104	So it looks like the controller is a big part of that.
1588124	1591205	So it kind of pieces together with what we heard about the delay the first time.
1591286	1597888	So that whole innovative controller thing will somehow come into play with the Revolution.
1598269	1598589	Interesting.
1599670	1600991	That's really all I got on the Revolution.
1601011	1602112	There's not a whole lot of other news.
1602152	1602832	You got something?
1602912	1606414	I got something real quick on the PlayStation 3, which I thought was very interesting.
1606695	1612338	Everyone's wondering what the Blu-ray thing, they were talking about region coding, whether they're actually just going to get rid of it or what's going on.
1612458	1614860	Well, at least for the U.S.
1614960	1622545	and Japanese, there's not going to be a real big issue because the region coding for the Blu-ray has been announced, and Japan and U.S.
1622745	1625487	are in the same region code, which should be very interesting.
1625567	1625667	Hmm.
1626187	1634270	Unfortunately, Europe, they're going to be getting the bone again as they put it in this article here because they're in a different region.
1634290	1636831	Well, that's not a surprise because their TVs are a different format.
1637471	1641252	Yeah, but with the high-def TVs, I would have figured they're all in the same format now.
1641272	1642773	Yeah, but how many people really have high-def?
1642793	1643593	Yeah.
1644873	1653396	All right, anyway, Loki, you had a story now about two of the systems here, PlayStation 3 versus Xbox 360 and what Microsoft's kind of,
1653956	1662758	The whole thing with the 360, it's always been from the get-go that whenever the PlayStation 3 was going to come out, they were going to launch Halo.
1663198	1676320	So it's only fitting that when they're going to announce the PlayStation 3 launch that they're going to announce the Halo 3 launch, which is supposedly going to happen at the Consumer Electronics Show 2006, which is happening actually in January here.
1676360	1680481	So a few more weeks and we'll know a little bit more about Halo 3.
1681226	1684087	Hopefully, at least that's what's going to be rumored to go down.
1684267	1687168	I think that's always Microsoft's little trump card, is that, well, we got Halo 3.
1687208	1688769	Uh-huh, we got Halo 3.
1688929	1689649	And you know what, though?
1689789	1697673	I'm sorry to say it, but I mean, Halo is a pretty good game, but a lot of the other games that are coming out, like Gears of War right now, they're really good.
1698113	1708557	And this game better be damn amazing, like, you know, breakthrough good in order for it to... Because pretty soon people are going to get to the point where, Halo 3's coming out, oh, well, good for you, you know.
1709727	1710007	I don't know.
1710047	1713289	I think there's a hardcore enough fanbase for Halo that it won't matter.
1713329	1715190	Halo 3 could blow goats, and it wouldn't matter.
1715250	1715670	It's Halo.
1717211	1717992	I don't think it will, though.
1718032	1723375	I do think it'll raise the bar, because I have high expectations, and I don't think I'll be disappointed.
1723835	1724275	But we'll see.
1724716	1725156	Time will tell.
1726104	1741169	Anyway, let's move on, and DarkSakura, you know, she's got to keep us in check sometimes, especially during this holiday season, because, you know, you guys might be sitting there and you're playing these games all day long, but you need to remember to go outside once in a while, play in the snow, unless you're in California, then play in the rain.
1741469	1741929	Play in the mud.
1742529	1742889	Play in the mud.
1743910	1749951	And if we, you know, sat around and played video games all day long, we'd have no time to go out and get drunk off an eggnog.
1751032	1753993	So, anyway, DarkSakura's here to give us her advice column.
1754013	1754573	DarkSakura,
1755114	1756695	What are you going to tell the kids about this week?
1757796	1761800	Today's piece of advice is how to stop a runaway one-horse open sleigh.
1762300	1765383	Now, things that could have been brought to my attention last week, DarkSakura.
1765923	1769346	Sorry, I didn't know that you were riding in a one-horse open sleigh.
1769406	1769947	That's all right.
1770007	1770527	Tell me anyway.
1770747	1772669	Number one, stay in the sleigh.
1773230	1776192	Grip the cedar railing with one hand and the reins with the other.
1777794	1780796	Did they just kind of translate the rules of a Ferris wheel?
1781937	1782438	No, forget it.
1782458	1782738	Go ahead.
1783787	1784768	2.
1784007	1784768	Grab the reins.
1785328	1789872	If you cannot reach the reins or they are loose and dragging on the ground, do not attempt to reach them.
1790292	1792874	Hold on to the sleigh and wait for the horses to tire.
1793414	1795596	Why is it horses if it's a one horse open sleigh?
1795616	1796277	It's so retarded.
1796777	1797037	Okay, 3.
1798118	1801120	Tug and release the reins with a medium pressure.
1801641	1803602	Repeat until the horse begins to slow down.
1805083	1803602	4.
1805664	1808426	When the horse slows down to a slow lope or a chop...
1809341	1810762	Pull one rein to the side.
1811082	1814024	With steady pressure, move the horse's head all the way around toward you.
1814384	1816585	This will cause the horse to begin going in a circle.
1816725	1819186	The horse will quickly tire of circling and slow to a walk.
1820047	1819186	5.
1820507	1823749	Pull back with steady pressure on both reins until the horse stops.
1824609	1827631	But my final, final piece of advice... Yes, ma'am?
1828431	1828972	Take a taxi.
1835515	1836896	Big political news going on.
1838413	1840795	I'm loving this GamePolitics.com site.
1840895	1846739	It's the place for me to catch up on all the drama that's going on with various legislations and stuff.
1847039	1852082	They ran a couple stories this week about, of course, the California video game law being blocked by a federal judge.
1852102	1853023	I don't know if you've heard about this.
1853363	1857966	Well, hopefully, if you've listened to the show, you've heard about it, because we talked about it a lot when it first came out.
1858306	1866612	Well, a federal judge, that would be Judge Ronald White, actually blocked it, and somebody, I guess, filled GamePolitics in on the fact that
1867512	1870435	The games were protected by the First Amendment, said Judge White.
1870735	1874217	Children have First Amendment rights and the concept of strict scrutiny applies.
1874858	1875779	So, very interesting.
1875819	1878881	Basically, it's a First Amendment violation as a lot of critics said it was going to be.
1879341	1880102	So, very interesting.
1880502	1887527	Now, of course, rebuttal coming from Yee, Assemblyman Yee, who was the one who originally wrote this bill.
1888388	1889549	Basically, a type of, you know,
1890109	1897137	The injunction is a temporary phase, blah blah blah, we're confident that common sense will prevail, blah blah blah.
1897457	1898419	I thought this part was interesting.
1898859	1909131	Judge White's 17-page opinion granting the injunction made clear that while a preliminary injunction may be necessary in the short term, he also challenged some of the claims made by the plaintiffs.
1911593	1924924	He indicated that despite the claims of the ESA and the VDA that the Act is far too burdensome to apply as a standard to video game products, that the Act should be simple enough for an ordinary person to apply the games submitted to the court.
1925625	1927146	But then I also thought this was kind of interesting.
1928327	1936994	Medical data clearly indicates that these ultra-violent video games have harmful effects on kids, and thus we have a state interest to protect them, blah, blah, blah, you know where that's going.
1937014	1938415	Excuse me, that's actually crap.
1939591	1942633	Did you bring up something the exact opposite on a previous show?
1942653	1949819	Well, first of all, the Department of Justice has proven that there has been... We're actually at a 30-year all-time low in violence among youth.
1950459	1951020	First of all.
1952461	1956024	Secondly... Is that just because all the kids are killing each other, so there's less to commit crimes?
1956064	1956204	No.
1956244	1956904	Kidding, kidding.
1957024	1967232	It takes... But it would have to take some sort of really fucked-up-in-the-head child to just go out and say, Oh, I play Unreal Tournament.
1967252	1969114	I'm going to go kill everybody in my school.
1971982	1977286	And on one little thing, the comment about common sense, I do think common sense did prevail.
1978727	1979347	Oh, snap.
1981529	1984111	We've had this debate for the past six months, so I'm almost a little done with it.
1984351	1989814	But my biggest issue with the California law was the fact that it didn't set a clear regulation.
1989834	1993417	It seemed like the bill was open to a lot of interpretation, so I hope if it is...
1994164	2005056	Going back to the drawing board, I hope that's what they work on is some type of clear set guideline, some type of third-party board reviews these games and gives them the rating, whatever, just, you know,
2006610	2008691	As I've said many times before, they should be done just like movies.
2008991	2009511	What's the big deal?
2009591	2011731	Well, that's how they are done in Europe.
2012691	2013892	You know what I'm disappointed about?
2014112	2014292	What?
2014452	2015272	Arnold Schwarzenegger.
2015712	2015992	Really?
2016112	2017112	What is the problem with him?
2017453	2021353	Would the Terminator let a law like this be appealed so simply?
2021754	2025955	No, the Terminator would go out and kill the bastards that try to appeal this law.
2026895	2029855	Arnold Schwarzenegger should be just ruling California with an iron fist.
2031436	2033376	Either that or he should quit and go back to movies again.
2034257	2035777	Can we switch topics, please?
2036980	2040663	Please, just because I think he's so pathetic that he's not going to get reelected, but still.
2040984	2044367	Oh, you can send those cards and letters to DarkSakura, care of Orange Lounge Radio.
2045408	2047169	Oh, to go at OrangeLoungeRadio.com, actually.
2047350	2047730	Yeah.
2048591	2049972	Oh, send those flowers.
2050913	2051473	Oh, let's see.
2051754	2059181	That's okay, because I'm already going to go buy an island when I'm rich and infamous and create DarkSakura land.
2060293	2064418	Where I'm, you know, goddess of the island Where King Kong lives No!
2064798	2076211	I don't like big hairy apes And bad adaptations of movies Moving on, moving on This is the week, of course, where everybody's gotta whip out their best of the year list, right?
2076820	2084404	because, you know, we're in that time where it's almost the first of 2006, so everybody, I don't know, we feel this need in our society to rank things.
2084424	2086425	Like, we've got to have a frickin' best game of the year.
2086785	2088946	So, of course, some of the game sites are getting in on the fun.
2089546	2093068	GameSpy has released their list of the top ten games of the year.
2093148	2093608	Here they are.
2094229	2097270	Ten, Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell Chaos Theory on Xbox.
2098011	2100872	Nine, Legend of Zelda The Minish Cap, Game Boy Advance.
2101752	2104634	Eight, Dragon Quest VIII, Journey of the Cursed King, PlayStation 2.
2106299	2121846	7, Half-Life 2 on the Xbox, 6, Battlefield 2 on the PC, 5, Call of Duty 2 on the Xbox 360, 4, Mario Kart DS on the Nintendo DS, 3, God of War on the PlayStation 2, 2, Resident Evil 4 on the GameCube, and 1, Civ 4 on the PC.
2121906	2123147	It was their number one game of the year.
2124027	2127189	GameSpot also did their Game of the Year, but they do it a little differently.
2127209	2129410	They nominate and then they name one as the Game of the Year.
2129950	2144598	Nominated, they nominated Battlefield 2, Civilization 4, FEAR, Forza Motorsport, God of War, Guild Wars, Guitar Hero, Mario Kart DS, Ninja Gaiden Black, and the winner was Resident Evil 4 on the GameCube.
2145218	2161575	So, I thought we could get in on the fun, but you know what guys, I don't like, say, I don't want to name the best game of the year, because, you know what, we're just, we're gamers, and you're gonna disagree with us no matter what we say, so we're gonna say our favorite game of 2005, and try to stay away from that whole controversial best of thing, because...
2161875	2164937	You know, even though we like to think we're important, we know we're not.
2165037	2167578	So, what were our favorite games of 2005?
2167678	2170379	I just want to know a runner-up and a best of and why.
2170459	2172701	So, Loki, your runner-up for best game of 2005.
2173061	2178143	My runner-up for best game of 2005 would be Burnout Legend.
2178263	2179344	Or Burnout Revenge, actually.
2179464	2180364	Screw Burnout Legends.
2180404	2181465	Burnout Legends sucked.
2182365	2183226	Burnout Revenge.
2183666	2186728	I played that game non-stop for months.
2187388	2189109	It's just really fun.
2189500	2196266	The only thing it lacked was good single-player mode, but it's just really fun, and I'm really looking forward to Burnout Revenge when it comes out in the 360.
2197947	2200950	Of course, my top game for... No, no, no.
2200970	2201951	Hold still.
2202011	2203072	I want to do my runner-up, too.
2205434	2206495	All right, let's see.
2206615	2215303	My runner-up for best game of the year, I would say probably the runner-up I would call best game of the year would probably be... This is a tough one for me, and...
2216255	2227867	When you put this next to my game of the year, I'm going to get some interesting reactions, but I would say my runner-up for best game of the year would be Meteos on Nintendo DS because I thought it was such a great puzzler.
2227927	2234994	It really started the wave of great games coming out for the DS, and I thought it was a puzzler with a lot of replayability value to it.
2235475	2239339	But I've got to admit, as far as DS goes, this is a very close call for me with Mario Kart DS.
2239679	2268002	but my problem with Mario Kart DS is that it did feel a little bit rushed and I don't think the online was polished enough for me to really consider it a game of the year title but I do acknowledge that Nintendo has made leaps and bounds in that whole online world thing and I think Mario Kart set a great precedent but I don't think I could call it my favorite game of the year because Meteos got a lot more play for me so Meteos would be my runner up for game of the year DarkSakura, you're runner up for game of the year Animal Crossing Animal Crossing DS, why?
2269581	2272063	I don't know, it's just I play it every day.
2273084	2279571	It's the first game that I have, even when I was so busy with school, I've made time for it every day.
2280512	2280772	Awesome.
2281032	2282994	So it definitely gets it.
2283415	2283835	Sounds good.
2284176	2285056	Loki, game of the year.
2285657	2287559	My game of the year is just
2288072	2290535	Grand Theft Auto Liberty City Stories
2311192	2311533	DarkSakura,
2325001	2330844	I haven't seen this get a lot of, it got a lot of critical acclaim when it first came out, but it's noticeably absent from a lot of these top game of the year lists.
2331224	2334186	And honestly, this was a game that sold systems.
2334466	2335666	This was a system seller.
2335927	2337307	This was an amazing game.
2337647	2340969	It revolutionized an entire genre of game.
2341409	2350654	And I realize this is going to sound a little weird when you put it next to my runner-up, but, because the fact that they were both made by the same company, but my runner-up is really the game that I played a heck of a lot of.
2350994	2355118	But my game of the year is something I got to recognize as being like it really pushed the bar.
2355559	2358401	Luminous for the PSP is absolutely my favorite game that came out this year.
2359222	2362845	I think it's the reason to have a PSP for me.
2363306	2363806	It really is.
2363886	2368891	And I know I sound like a total puzzle game addict when you put those two side by side, but they really did.
2369151	2370973	They pushed the bar in different ways for their systems.
2371013	2374316	And this really was considered, we're looking at the year of the...
2375177	2375557	and DarkSakura.
2396044	2398066	Recycle, recycle, recycle Oh, let's not do MIDI this time
2425578	2429061	But Guitar Freaks actually makes it feel like you're playing a guitar.
2429162	2438430	I thought it was very, very cool of Red Octane to come out to my house and say, here, you can play Guitar Freaks in your living room on TV.
2439351	2446298	And I thought that that was really cool that they put that time and effort into it to try to make it something that...
2447219	2453164	The people would want to play, instead of just saying, oh, well, we're doing something like Guitar Freaks.
2453364	2453904	No, no, no, no.
2454364	2456446	They innovated on it, and I thought that was pretty cool.
2457447	2457947	There you have it.
2457987	2462130	Our picks for Games of the Year 2005.
2462230	2463131	Our picks.
2463171	2463612	There you have it.
2463712	2464012	All right.
2464672	2465273	Moving on.
2465333	2468175	Let's talk about DarkSakura.
2468195	2472098	You had an interesting kind of feature story about innovation in the scene.
2472138	2473159	What's this all about?
2473760	2481662	Yeah, speaking of innovation, there's an article up on GameSpot that I thought was pretty interesting.
2481762	2488844	Actually, it was one that a friend of mine who's a game tester referred me to, and I thought that it was pretty interesting.
2490904	2503147	Basically, there's not so much of a lack of innovation as much as a lack of wanting to use that innovation that's going out, you know?
2505549	2508090	There's actually a very good quote in here.
2508810	2512151	This is, innovation is dead, dying.
2512211	2518853	Every once in a while, somebody will slip something in that will shock us, but for the most part, there's no money in innovation, even if it's great.
2519413	2526395	Basically, the industry is really looking for what do people already like, and can we make a sequel?
2527456	2530178	We are seeing such sequel-intensive titles now.
2530718	2533100	We see more Halos, more Metal Gear.
2534662	2538125	Instead, what was the last really innovative game that we got?
2538585	2541768	For example, Luminous I thought was very good, but it's still a puzzle game.
2542982	2545984	Well, Katamari Damacy now, that was innovation.
2546425	2547906	But yeah, we got a sequel this year.
2547926	2549867	And it's more of the same.
2550508	2551248	It is and it isn't.
2551308	2560295	It did expand on it, but I couldn't name Katamari Damacy or We Heart Katamari my game of the year because you're right, it wasn't as innovative as the first time you saw it, you know what I mean?
2560775	2572429	The best business for a publisher is to give people what you know they want.
2572950	2577255	And what you know they want is a sequel to what they won last time, so we don't see a whole lot of innovation.
2577675	2578796	You know what's interesting, DarkSakura?
2578836	2583659	I'm actually, as you're saying this and talking about sequels and everything, I'm looking at GameSpice Top 10, just up top of my head here.
2584159	2592405	Out of these 10 games on the list, only one of them is not a sequel or some type of story continuation type thing, like a...
2593465	2595707	Tom Clancy, Splinter Cell, Chaos Theory.
2596047	2598608	Only one of these games, God of War, is a new title.
2598628	2604051	There's another good quote from him in here, and this actually makes a lot of sense because I was just discussing this with somebody the other day.
2604111	2609594	It wasn't just with my husband, it was with a couple other people because Dan and I talk games all the time.
2610955	2616378	It's another one from him that says, the problem I have with the whole sequel thing is it's not just sequels.
2616958	2620364	It's once we see that World War II combat shooters work, we've got 50 of them.
2620724	2625572	The funny thing is that the next year after we saw that, everyone thought if World War II worked, Vietnam would work too.
2625953	2627435	But all those games were a disaster.
2627535	2630240	Now we've got how many more World War II games coming out?
2631766	2638231	So we see them trying to go on the same path and then it going, no, no, no, we like this.
2638951	2650739	So on top of that, it's not necessarily that there's not a willingness to innovate as much as there's not a willingness of the consumer base to test an innovative product.
2651721	2652482	Civil War First Person Shooter
2672345	2686291	DarkSakura, what do you think, I got a question for you, what do you think of Nintendo's sort of response to this whole thing, is this kind of like, Nintendo kind of sees, well, if the games aren't innovating, let's innovate the system, and kind of
2686829	2687569	See what happens.
2687949	2689270	See, they're taking a big risk.
2689410	2691150	Yeah, that's what I say, too, is they're taking a big risk.
2691230	2694751	Nintendo, when you are Nintendo, you can do no wrong.
2695491	2696472	Virtually wrong.
2697132	2702653	Yeah, but the thing is that I think that they're really resting on their lulls quite a bit.
2702913	2704594	You know, hey, we're Nintendo.
2704634	2706594	We can get away with this crap, and you'll like it.
2706754	2708315	Because we said so, because we're Nintendo.
2708956	2717959	Do you think it's one of those things where Nintendo's sort of like, they're going to try this out, but even if they fail miserably, they can always turn the controller sideways and it's just like any other console.
2717979	2719280	You know what they're going to do?
2719300	2722601	I see them pulling an Xbox.
2723381	2724661	Oh, you don't like this controller?
2724721	2725562	Here's another one.
2726162	2729023	You know when we got the controller S and now it's almost the standard?
2729778	2731439	Interesting, yeah, true, true.
2731459	2741463	The controller S that we got over here was the same one released with the Japanese systems, which I knew people freaking importing that controller because it's so much more comfortable than the Humongoid controller.
2742423	2744124	I'm sorry, I got these little small fingers.
2744704	2745965	I wouldn't touch our Xbox.
2746005	2753908	So the whole thing is that now, I think that's what's going to happen with Nintendo is that people are going to go, oh, this controller is kind of stupid.
2754571	2755331	We want a real one.
2756252	2756972	I don't know, again.
2757332	2758852	More money in the Nintendo pocket.
2759332	2765935	But if they put out the Zelda games and the Mario games, which you could question, is that really innovative?
2766235	2770516	But if they put that kind of stuff out with a controller and it does well, who knows?
2771096	2776938	Well, I think that there's a very good example in here, though, of innovative projects that they've proven have worked.
2777258	2777838	Psychonauts.
2779719	2783700	Where it was officially going to be an Xbox exclusive and Microsoft dropped it.
2785541	2788203	They went to all over the place.
2788783	2790765	And Majesco, of course, picked it up.
2791485	2793766	The game was released on Xbox, PC, PS2.
2794567	2797749	I think one of the ones that's listed in here that they went to was Vivendi.
2798349	2802291	And they said they were interested in it, but said it was too risky.
2802852	2806394	But it's been one of the... I haven't played enough of that game to really know.
2806554	2807655	I haven't honestly played much.
2807895	2811477	I've been considering it just because I've heard how neat it is, but...
2812059	2817161	But still, I mean, you know, it's also, though, why we don't get a lot of the really awesome Japanese games, I think.
2817961	2821863	You know, we never got, what, we never got, what, Psychic Force over here?
2821903	2823583	Well, we damn near didn't get Katamari Damashii.
2823703	2825144	We didn't get Oz over here.
2825404	2825584	No.
2826084	2826344	So.
2826824	2830025	You know, and on top of that, I think that's why it's taken so long for us to get DDR.
2830466	2831366	Why it's taken us so long.
2831606	2834447	Like, we're just now getting Beatmania, and how long has it been out in Japan?
2835247	2835948	Ninety, well.
2835968	2836228	Ninety-three.
2836608	2836928	Ninety-three.
2837779	2838399	Yeah, a long time.
2838679	2839580	No, not that long.
2839880	2840060	Yes.
2840700	2841000	Really?
2841521	2841781	Yeah.
2842201	2842681	It's been a while.
2842741	2843482	Geez.
2843542	2846163	No, because the first mix was on PlayStation.
2846183	2847643	PlayStation was... Oh, shit, maybe.
2847824	2848324	All right, anyway.
2848344	2849164	All right, whatever.
2849204	2849844	So a long time.
2850485	2853666	Well, keep in mind that the PlayStation was released in Japan in 93.
2854487	2854807	Yeah.
2855227	2858308	Because we had mine in my dorm room in 94, and it was new.
2858868	2860869	Wow, wow, wow, wow.
2861029	2861870	But it's just been...
2862805	2864305	It takes forever for us to get anything.
2864465	2871427	And their market, I think, is always looking for something new and fresh and something different because there's so much that's homogenous in their society.
2871647	2878149	Do we have a skewed perspective, though, because we happen to be fans of those types of games, but maybe those games aren't really the ones that sell here?
2878209	2884991	Because when you look at the American market, despite our distaste towards these games, it is all about Madden.
2885563	2887965	and NBA Live and all that stuff.
2888405	2895190	Is that why we... I honestly think that the average American has too narrow a scope to look for anything new and different beyond what they already know.
2896511	2900614	Again, those cards and letters can go to... I said average.
2900874	2901094	I know.
2901374	2906078	And if you listen to this show, you've already demonstrated... You've already demonstrated that you have impeccable taste.
2907192	2908774	Anyway, we've got to move on to another story.
2908794	2910495	Where was this again?
2910655	2912337	I think this might be a good read.
2912377	2913698	I'll go ahead and give out the URL.
2913738	2920784	It's at gamespot.com slash news slash 6141519 dot html.
2921604	2922445	Very good article.
2922465	2924226	I suggest everyone give it a thorough reading.
2924907	2926588	Well, now let's counterbalance.
2927109	2932193	DarkSakura has given us something very thoughtful and very good brain stimulant.
2932533	2935676	Let's go to the complete opposite end of the spectrum and talk about Jack Thompson.
2937620	2945242	Jack Thompson has bought stock in Take-Two Interactive, who publishes rockstar games like The Warriors and Grand Theft Auto San Andreas.
2945602	2948742	Why the hell would he do this when this is his main enemy, DarkSakura?
2948982	2950122	I know exactly why.
2950142	2950483	What's he doing?
2950603	2954083	We brought up something on the live show about people complaining about Konami.
2954623	2959604	He wants, as a stockholder, he has the right to challenge any business decision of the company.
2960204	2961405	And that's exactly what he's doing.
2961425	2963025	He wants to be able to go to stockholder meetings.
2964534	2968959	I have to say, as much as I loathe the man, that's freaking brilliant.
2968979	2970500	You know what's also brilliant?
2970801	2976887	The fact that he hasn't re-registered his site, StopKill.com, which, by the way, domain is up for auction right now.
2977288	2979771	So if you've got $60, you can actually go bid on it.
2982096	2984518	Thank you for watching!
3007344	3008024	Anyway, we'll see.
3008064	3010465	This is the sound of my wallet and zipping.
3010485	3011386	We'll see what happens.
3011426	3012126	More to come on that.
3012186	3014247	Anyway, we'll talk offline about that.
3014667	3020209	Also, what I thought was interesting, there's a little dig here at Microsoft CEO Bill Gates.
3020849	3021550	What's next?
3021610	3025991	A game in which players can practice flying commercial jetliners into the world trade towers?
3026391	3026972	Oh, I forgot.
3027032	3028412	Microsoft already did that.
3028512	3030413	Bank Times Man of the Year, Bill Gates.
3031693	3033054	Which I think is kind of a low blow.
3033114	3035235	I mean, come on.
3036650	3038272	This is my open letter to Jack Thompson.
3038292	3038452	Give up.
3038492	3040094	Please, just give up.
3040154	3042337	People are laughing at you.
3054966	3060352	Loki, you had a story about In the Groove, because we were talking about Guitar Hero earlier.
3060392	3064636	Let's talk about Red Octane's other music game that wasn't quite as critically acclaimed, but what's going on with In the Groove?
3064816	3066538	In the Groove is coming to the PC.
3068171	3069291	More info coming soon in thegroove.com
3093362	3105291	Now, for those people actually still playing Step Mania, or as I like to call it, In The Groove 3, you can actually download a brand new build of Step Mania 4.0, which isn't finalized yet.
3105531	3112416	But anyways, this one has ParaPara support, which you can actually use the Japanese controller with, the USB one.
3112716	3114438	And they've got some test songs on there as well.
3114518	3116579	So definitely worth checking out.
3116599	3118541	You can find all that at stepmania.com.
3119141	3122704	Pada, pada, pada dice, because you don't look fruity enough playing DDR.
3123402	3123922	Exactly.
3124143	3126504	Hey, we've seen Fruity on that game.
3127065	3127645	I know, I know.
3128606	3132609	Drunken parties where people are putting on their girlfriends' clothing.
3133669	3137233	Moving on, before we get letters about that, let's talk about letters, DarkSakura.
3137273	3138695	What the hell's in our mailbag this week?
3139135	3145722	If you want to send fan letters or hate letters or letters that encourage stimulating conversation or news tips.
3145762	3148045	We have an awful lot of news tips from our buddy Rob.
3148926	3150367	Let me guess, do we have a Rob mail this week?
3150407	3152590	We actually did get a Rob mail, but I've already covered it.
3154091	3156172	Pulled that up from one of the sites that I review already.
3156793	3159334	Actually, no, I haven't done it yet.
3159394	3160675	It's an article I'd already pulled up.
3160695	3160935	Sorry.
3161035	3162236	Oh, but you were going to cover it.
3162276	3162976	I was going to cover it.
3162996	3163596	Oh, shit.
3163616	3164117	Go for it.
3164157	3164437	Why not?
3164457	3171101	About Ubisoft working with Taito to release Exit for the PSP.
3172161	3174403	And it's a puzzle action game.
3174443	3175483	Looks like Oddworld 2.
3176444	3180826	But I got my news from a different source than what he linked to me.
3181046	3182347	Gotcha.
3182407	3183308	Just to give a little...
3184801	3198855	Background for this story, players control an escapologist called Mr. ESC, like your escape button, and must guide him around obstacles while rescuing people, you know, you have fires, earthquakes, stuff like that.
3199656	3203220	A hundred different scenarios, downloadable content also made available.
3205199	3208701	Exit's also going along just for our European listeners.
3208761	3221088	It's going to be... They're saying that it's going to fit in very well with some of the games being released like Frantics and Grip Shift, which is a puzzle driving game.
3221369	3222709	Cool.
3223610	3227953	Just a couple other of the emails received as soon as I poo them up.
3228153	3229314	One of our new listeners, Mason...
3230848	3232970	who I think has just the most awesome email ever.
3232990	3235111	I'm not going to give it out, but yeah, I like donuts too.
3236853	3244098	So he imported Guitar Freak's controller and a copy of Guitar Freak's fourth Mexican game.
3244478	3245339	His controller broke.
3245699	3248702	Honestly, third-party controllers, never buy them.
3249302	3251504	Hello, get the Konami controller, sorry.
3251644	3256227	You know what's really interesting, you know, if you want to go into history, is that who was making most of the third-party controllers for Guitar Freak's?
3256668	3257268	Red Octane.
3257508	3258509	What's their bread and butter now?
3259073	3259473	Guitar Hero.
3279778	3281059	Guitar Hero is worth the money that you'll spend on it.
3281139	3282440	On top of that, if you're going to play Guitar Freaks...
3307323	3313787	I know of sites I will tell you via email where I do my ordering from because I don't want to, unless they want to pay us.
3314987	3320230	But I ordered both of my controllers for very reasonable, although they're a lot harder to get now.
3320350	3321850	And Guitar Hero has Freeze Pop.
3321990	3322551	Freeze Pop!
3322711	3323551	Yes, they have Freeze Pop.
3323971	3328774	And also it's kind of funny if you can go back and watch the making of movies, they're really fun.
3330396	3330936	Any other emails?
3331537	3331717	Yes.
3334159	3349610	Rodney, it says Roddycat, has sent us an email saying about how Sega, mentioning back to our Sega making a classic game story, and he's thinking it's Alex Kidd.
3351952	3353053	I don't know.
3353513	3356675	I was like, well, it's not quite running good.
3356856	3358597	It's a franchise that I think should be revived.
3360051	3369415	Yeah, actually, my favorite ever game for the Master System, next to, of course, Fantasy Zone, because I'm a big Fantasy Zone whore.
3369616	3370136	Space Harrier?
3371116	3372617	Well, yeah, Space Harrier.
3373157	3377219	But I mean, like, I really love Alex Kidd and Shinobi World.
3378540	3379780	That's just fun.
3379840	3385083	For me, this was more a Genesis thing, but it's got to be Altered Beast.
3385103	3386724	Rise from your grave.
3386824	3387064	Anyway.
3388615	3397528	Yeah, and also we got kudos from our Mac Man for reading his last letter on air.
3398069	3401174	So I'm going to say hi again, Mac Man.
3402529	3406872	So if you want to get said hi to on the air, it's 2go at orangelawntrader.com is our email address.
3406892	3407732	He cracked me up.
3407812	3412615	He said, Macman equals I who have superb taste in computers.
3415737	3416978	Any rebuttal from Loki?
3416998	3417538	Loki rebuttal?
3417919	3418239	All right.
3418779	3418939	Huh?
3419399	3419700	Forget it.
3419760	3423222	It's from Macman, our Mac player guy.
3423282	3425543	Loki's looking at porn on the other computer or something.
3425563	3428165	Oh, we lost Loki now for minutes on end.
3428516	3430397	I'm looking at info, okay?
3431198	3431738	About porn.
3431759	3432159	About porn.
3432179	3433180	It's not about porn.
3433660	3437723	However, though, there is a game coming out that I really do want to check out.
3437763	3453235	This is coming out for our European audience, which was actually already released before as the simple 2000 series volume 50, the Daiboujin, which is going to be re-released as Demolition Girl.
3453575	3457138	It's a game where you fly around in a helicopter and you attack 50-foot women.
3458325	3460547	I don't know, that just appeals to me in some way.
3461147	3463329	Loki, Loki, mailbag, mailbag time.
3463389	3464550	Your time later, mailbag time.
3464990	3465771	Actually, I'm done.
3465891	3466251	Oh, that's it.
3466291	3466772	Okay, never mind.
3467112	3468433	Anything else then about The Demolition Girl?
3469234	3470295	Does it have Daryl Hannah in it?
3470315	3477480	It does not have Daryl Hannah in it, but it's actually being released in Europe as a budget title, which is very interesting.
3477701	3479722	Definitely need to check it out, among other games.
3480863	3482865	Kingdom Hearts 2, which I'll be playing probably this week.
3482925	3484406	Oh, Kingdom Hearts 2!
3485187	3489070	I watched the ending because I'm bad.
3489911	3490771	I am so awful.
3491352	3495996	And the ending leaves me with many more questions than anything else I've seen on the internet.
3496036	3498598	So in other words, it's inevitable there's going to be a Kingdom Hearts 3.
3499519	3500499	I don't know, actually.
3500519	3500820	3 and 4.
3501480	3503782	But Jamie needs this game now.
3503862	3505063	I'm freaking tempted to import it.
3506853	3508954	Except I don't know, I can't read Japanese very well.
3509494	3518057	This is a good plug for our live station which runs music from games 24 hours a day, 7 days a week at OrangeLunchRadio.com because we just put in rotation this week the theme from Kingdom Hearts 2.
3518197	3519737	It's Utada Hikaru with Passion.
3522658	3525039	Of course I picked like the worst clip from, let's try another clip.
3533567	3535289	Anyway, check that out over at OrangeLunchRadio.com.
3535309	3539535	That's in rotation now, so... I need that for one particular level, actually.
3540396	3541237	Freakin' Tron.
3541958	3542939	Freakin' Tron, I know.
3542959	3543760	That'd be awesome.
3544280	3545902	They put a Chicken Little level in there.
3546183	3547865	No, Chicken Little is not in there.
3547905	3548486	He's a summon.
3549444	3554185	Oh, okay, because I saw that Zach Braff was doing the voice in the American version, because they released the voice.
3554285	3558466	That list is the one off of IMDb, and it is not correct.
3558626	3559007	Really?
3559747	3559947	Oh.
3561467	3567829	Do not trust anything that IMDb puts out as far as voice acting goes until the official list comes out.
3567849	3570790	Yeah, that's because IMDb is user-powered, right?
3571230	3571590	Exactly.
3572430	3575471	And all they did was port over the actors who played them.
3576792	3580594	However, I do have a strong feeling that they are going to get Johnny Depp.
3581654	3582114	Well, we'll see.
3582975	3586737	And, and, and, and, there's also Steamboat Willie, lovely, so cute.
3588433	3594635	Alright, let's go over to Loki who has a couple more stories for us about, well just clear us out whatever stories you got over there Loki.
3594695	3601357	Okay, real quick, there was actually some really nice Christmas gifts that a few game publishers have been putting out.
3602178	3606619	These being in the form of new downloads for some games actually out there right now.
3607159	3611481	The first one starting off with the Xbox is they've actually got some map packs coming out.
3611994	3614255	for Star Wars Battlefront 2.
3614955	3618336	And you can get those actually available on Xbox Live.
3619036	3619776	And they're available.
3620016	3628679	They're going to be having another January pack coming out at about $5 featuring some more maps in there as well, which is pretty cool.
3629539	3632600	The other map pack that's coming out is actually for the PC.
3633160	3634500	And it's going to be for Quake 4.
3634800	3640462	And you've got three free maps that you can actually download on the official website idsoftware.com.
3641311	3643718	So definitely check those out if you play some Quake 4.
3644299	3645001	And then finally...
3646556	3649478	There was actually some for... Oh, no way.
3649578	3650199	Actually, that was it.
3650659	3651119	My mistake.
3651159	3652660	I had two of the same story on there.
3652760	3657424	I thought you had a story about Walmart stockpiling 360s or something.
3657444	3665409	Yes, Walmart's pulling a Best Buy, basically, and they're going to be doing a sale for New Year's, and they're stockpiling 360s, supposedly.
3665749	3666150	Interesting.
3666210	3671653	So definitely, if you haven't got a 360 yet, still interested in getting one, go check out your Walmart on New Year's Day.
3672014	3672354	All right.
3673010	3683999	I've been hearing rumors that, and I can't say what my source is or where I got it from, but some of the game vendors are hoping to have their pre-orders filled by actually mid to end January.
3684499	3685660	That's good news for a lot of people.
3685880	3686561	Let's hope it's true.
3687762	3688342	Anything else, Loki?
3689683	3698770	Finally, I was just going to mention, kind of in the homebrew sense, Senile Team, the people behind this kind of a Streets of Rage franchise,
3703824	3717014	They have a new game coming out called Age of Beast, which looks like an updated version of Streets of Rage, but they've done it in more of the Altered Beast type thing.
3717555	3718635	It should be really cool.
3718715	3724080	I'm actually looking forward to playing around with it some more because you can do some shooter type stuff.
3724120	3724700	Pretty good game.
3724780	3728563	Definitely check them out at senileteam.segaforums.com
3729506	3729826	All right.
3730786	3741750	And finally tonight, boys and girls, I hope this didn't happen to you, but World of Warcraft pulled what I would call a Ragnarok online this week when they said, we ban you.
3742570	3746271	We ban you to 18,000 accounts.
3746911	3747652	Canceled.
3748072	3749092	Why were they canceled?
3750080	3753342	Third-party programs to farm gold and items.
3753883	3755564	Stop effing up the economy.
3755964	3756705	You're banned.
3757926	3759567	I actually got my account canceled.
3760708	3762269	You weren't one of these 18,000, were you?
3762489	3764551	No, they rejected my ATM card because I got a new one.
3765812	3767313	That's not nearly as interesting.
3768291	3770012	I don't care if it's about you, that's not interesting.
3772213	3774495	Of course if it's about me it's interesting, I'm a show diva.
3774515	3778677	We're going to go around now and get everybody's final thought because we're about to wrap it up.
3778717	3781579	We do have one more note for you guys, but first the final thoughts.
3782220	3783080	Loki, your final thought.
3783681	3789644	My final thought is I've got to get to playing some of these games that I have on cue to basically play.
3790505	3793887	Kingdom Hearts 2, of course, because I have a walkthrough because I can't read Japanese.
3795038	3809544	my final thought would be January 1st on our live show we're making a huge announcement about the future of Orange Lounge Radio it will change everything it's going to be good check it out of course if you missed that we will say it on the podcast as well
3811306	3814948	and we're getting drunk?
3815649	3818831	Well, yeah, that'll be interesting nonetheless.
3819511	3823833	And of course that will air at 2 a.m.
3824374	3824994	London time.
3825014	3826775	6.30 to 9.30.
3827115	3829016	The next day.
3829777	3830977	Big, big announcement January 1st.
3831557	3832898	DarkSakura, your final thought.
3833839	3837741	Reject false icons and number two, remember, don't shoot the food.
3839087	3846311	Now, of course, we have one other little footnote because, you know, it is the holiday season and it's, you know, we're still spreading the cheer.
3846371	3850234	Even if Christmas is over, there's still, you know, Hanukkah, Kwanzaa, a bunch of holidays.
3850254	3852135	My brother told me happy Kwanzaa today.
3852155	3855617	Because you're so, you know, Kwanzaa celebrating.
3855657	3856458	Anyway.
3858739	3858939	Anyway.
3860953	3861253	DreamStation.cc
3886238	3889701	The folks from the Dream Station Video Game Show actually put this little happy holiday song together.
3890022	3895807	And it's kind of funny because they talk about noobs getting pwned in it, which is, you know, if you speak elite, that's pretty funny.
3896327	3898029	So we thought we'd play it for you guys here.
3898089	3903694	So if you want to hear more crazy antics from these guys, head on over to www.dreamstation.cc.
3903774	3906717	And remember, kids, support independent podcasts.
3908178	3909179	And we're closing with this.
3909259	3910160	So have a great week.
3910180	3910961	We'll see you next time.
3915526	3944025	The sounds of screams of love and stream, the camping center you haven't seen It's Christmas at Dream Station, where all the noobs get pwned The Halo fans with their demands, gripping on keyboard and mouse commands And FPS is still the best when playing it on PC A head shoppie comes open, it's time to make him fall And loyal Jack before he's back will sue us for house and door How brand new it feels to click your heels, writing this pro as you hear him squeal The council's full of party that likes you'll never know
3944485	3947822	It's Christmas Happy Station where all the news get pwned
3955396	3976765	The Net Cafe is where I play Addicted to gaming, I spend my pay It's Christmas in Korea, I haven't had food for days Xbox knows it's only slow Poor Nintendo has nothing to show The PC's slowly dying, except for the MMO The ducks are playing Madden, the chicks are playing WoW The PC dudes are fragging noobs, the noobs are wondering how
3977505	3979126	And just one final footnote.
3979166	3980067	Don't expect us to sing.
3980167	3980247	Ever.
3980287	3980487	Ever.
3980527	3982649	Hey, I think that we should end this show on a high note.
3982669	3982869	What?
3982929	3984590	Except I can't sing that high note.
4002220	4005042	We already know how the whole singing thing went down.
4006443	4006843	I forgot.
4006883	4008244	Put a copy of Karaoke Revolution.
4008364	4009885	No, no, no.
4010305	4017049	I think when we do our little outtakes DVD, we need to put I'm Staying In on it.
4019250	4020130	Longest show ever.
4020230	4020871	Good job, guys.
4020911	4022012	Happy holidays.
4022052	4023092	This is our gift.
4023372	4024453	See you next time.
4025854	4029397	That's the end of another Orange Lounge Radio To Go edition.
4029717	4035222	This podcast is a proud part of www.orangeloungeradio.com.
4035682	4036683	See you next update.
