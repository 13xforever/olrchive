00:00.464 --> 00:03.025
[SPEAKER_05]: Orange Lounge Radio To Go Edition, week of December 19th, 2005.

00:03.305 --> 00:13.547
[SPEAKER_03]: You're tuned in to the Orange Lounge Radio To Go Edition, your podcast home for all the latest video game news and gamer chat.

00:13.827 --> 00:17.668
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, here are your hosts, DarkSakura, Sky, and Loki.

00:19.568 --> 00:20.348
[SPEAKER_05]: Hello, everybody.

00:20.448 --> 00:27.650
[SPEAKER_05]: Once again, welcome to Orange Lounge Radio To Go, that podcast dedicated to video games and gaming.

00:28.493 --> 00:35.718
[SPEAKER_05]: We especially like to talk about games that don't suck, but you know, once in a while we gotta bring up games that do suck because we have to tell you to avoid them, like the plague.

00:36.399 --> 00:42.983
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm happy to report that I've escaped the plague, I'm not sick anymore, I'm feeling a lot better than I was last week for our 50th episode.

00:43.044 --> 00:45.585
[SPEAKER_05]: But over there, DarkSakura, how you doing?

00:45.605 --> 00:46.926
[SPEAKER_05]: You still a little plague-y, DarkSakura?

00:46.946 --> 00:49.248
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm still the carrier of the evil plague.

00:49.628 --> 00:50.669
[SPEAKER_05]: Are you infected?

00:51.830 --> 00:57.454
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm infected, but I don't think that I have the T-virus anymore because I haven't started trying to, you know,

00:57.915 --> 00:59.475
[SPEAKER_01]: to eat my husband for dinner.

00:59.755 --> 01:00.696
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh good, that's good.

01:00.816 --> 01:03.096
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I haven't been sniffing his spicy brains.

01:03.156 --> 01:05.677
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, you've gone seven weeks without doing that, huh?

01:06.117 --> 01:09.718
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I've actually gone seven weeks without eating much of anything.

01:10.858 --> 01:13.458
[SPEAKER_01]: But hey, leaves me more money to spend on games.

01:13.659 --> 01:14.159
[SPEAKER_05]: There you go.

01:14.739 --> 01:16.099
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki, I won't get to your games in a minute.

01:16.139 --> 01:17.799
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki, how you doing?

01:18.740 --> 01:20.740
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm still a bit congested, yes.

01:21.360 --> 01:22.941
[SPEAKER_05]: But mostly plague-free, like 99.7% plague-free.

01:25.034 --> 01:33.437
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, 99.9% Plague 3, but I did think I had the T-Virus because I did eat my fiancÃ©.

01:33.517 --> 01:38.179
[SPEAKER_01]: You need to not bring that on the show.

01:38.633 --> 01:47.519
[SPEAKER_05]: My name is Rob Roberts, also known as Sky, and I will be going back to a cleaner subject, such as, how was your gaming week, DarkSakura?

01:47.599 --> 01:49.361
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's a clean subject, huh?

01:49.401 --> 01:52.303
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, DarkSakura, lots of Animal Crossing.

01:52.323 --> 01:54.684
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, I'm sorry, I don't want to talk too much about Animal Crossing again.

01:54.845 --> 01:55.085
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, no.

01:56.226 --> 01:56.766
[SPEAKER_01]: Guess what?

01:56.906 --> 01:58.087
[SPEAKER_01]: I played Animal Crossing.

01:58.867 --> 01:59.428
[SPEAKER_05]: Anything else?

02:02.501 --> 02:04.241
[SPEAKER_01]: Not really, because last week was finals.

02:05.322 --> 02:07.222
[SPEAKER_01]: However, I did do something game-related.

02:08.562 --> 02:12.983
[SPEAKER_01]: And I can post a link to this on our forums, which people should be visiting.

02:13.123 --> 02:21.945
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, at OrangeLogsRadio.com But I did a game slipcover and backcover for Silent Hill, the movie, the game.

02:22.465 --> 02:25.486
[SPEAKER_01]: The irony is that I was doing a game based off a movie, based off a game.

02:25.726 --> 02:27.607
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that like Street Fighter II, the movie, the game?

02:28.127 --> 02:29.067
[SPEAKER_01]: Except it doesn't suck ass.

02:30.575 --> 02:31.656
[SPEAKER_05]: But this is not a real game.

02:31.716 --> 02:32.676
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's just get that clear.

02:32.696 --> 02:33.497
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not a real game.

02:33.517 --> 02:40.461
[SPEAKER_01]: But our illustrator project was to either do a CD, like music CD or game CD.

02:41.242 --> 02:43.063
[SPEAKER_01]: So I picked Silent Hill the Movie the Game.

02:43.163 --> 02:45.104
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm telling you, you need to do that poster project.

02:45.164 --> 02:47.686
[SPEAKER_05]: You should take that concept and make it like a poster.

02:48.447 --> 02:48.747
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what?

02:49.107 --> 02:49.527
[SPEAKER_05]: Hell with it.

02:49.567 --> 02:50.828
[SPEAKER_05]: Just send that in as your poster.

02:51.308 --> 02:52.149
[SPEAKER_05]: See what happens.

02:52.189 --> 02:53.170
[SPEAKER_05]: You never know what might happen.

02:53.550 --> 02:55.091
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd have to do a whole lot more to it.

02:55.331 --> 02:57.733
[SPEAKER_01]: However, it did give me some ideas for the poster.

02:57.773 --> 02:58.213
[SPEAKER_01]: So perhaps...

02:58.968 --> 02:59.869
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll make a project of that.

02:59.889 --> 03:02.710
[SPEAKER_05]: Get that done, though, because the deadline's fast approaching.

03:03.291 --> 03:03.511
[SPEAKER_01]: I know.

03:03.711 --> 03:06.033
[SPEAKER_05]: Anything else you've been playing this week?

03:07.814 --> 03:09.555
[SPEAKER_05]: No Silent Hill 3, no Sexy Dean?

03:09.595 --> 03:15.559
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, because all I did was work on my final projects for the first half of the week.

03:16.880 --> 03:21.763
[SPEAKER_01]: I honestly have not had time, but however, now that school's let out, I do have more time to play games.

03:21.883 --> 03:26.546
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm actually hunting down my Silent Hill 3 strategy guide right now because I need the map for the level I'm in.

03:26.826 --> 03:27.606
[SPEAKER_05]: Very nice.

03:27.627 --> 03:28.347
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm still in the hospital.

03:28.786 --> 03:30.307
[SPEAKER_05]: I do have to ask an Animal Crossing question.

03:30.327 --> 03:35.851
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't want to go into Animal Crossing ad nauseum again this week, but didn't you say there was a baby lost in your village?

03:36.412 --> 03:39.374
[SPEAKER_05]: Didn't you sell the baby to Tom Nook or something for bells?

03:39.594 --> 03:46.019
[SPEAKER_01]: I wanted to sell the baby to Crazy Red to sell on the black market, but he wasn't there, and so Loki rescued him and brought him back to his mommy.

03:47.080 --> 03:47.700
[SPEAKER_05]: That's very nice.

03:48.301 --> 03:48.961
[SPEAKER_01]: Good to hear.

03:49.261 --> 03:51.023
[SPEAKER_01]: But I did sell some furniture.

03:52.984 --> 03:54.345
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki, how was your gaming week?

03:54.926 --> 03:56.447
[SPEAKER_04]: My gaming week was diverse.

03:57.588 --> 03:57.988
[SPEAKER_04]: I played...

03:58.678 --> 04:02.561
[SPEAKER_04]: Some Animal Crossing, Grand Theft Auto Liberty City Stories, Five Player Deathmatches

04:19.082 --> 04:19.663
[SPEAKER_05]: Call of Duty 2 Deathmatches

04:35.393 --> 04:36.594
[SPEAKER_04]: And that game's actually really cool.

04:36.854 --> 04:38.234
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm very pleased with it.

04:38.694 --> 04:40.375
[SPEAKER_04]: I haven't played much Perfect Dark.

04:40.655 --> 04:41.816
[SPEAKER_04]: Did play a little bit of Cameo.

04:41.956 --> 04:43.396
[SPEAKER_04]: That was really cool.

04:43.996 --> 04:44.797
[SPEAKER_04]: Still pretty easy.

04:45.397 --> 04:48.958
[SPEAKER_04]: But overall, decent game for a launch, I guess.

04:49.179 --> 04:50.419
[SPEAKER_04]: What does Cameo really like?

04:50.599 --> 04:51.479
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a platform game.

04:52.080 --> 04:52.600
[SPEAKER_05]: What does that mean?

04:52.740 --> 04:55.181
[SPEAKER_05]: Does it mean like a Crash Bandicoot type of game, or what?

04:56.522 --> 04:56.982
[SPEAKER_05]: Spyro?

04:57.182 --> 04:59.383
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a platform game.

04:59.403 --> 05:04.545
[SPEAKER_04]: Basically a lot of jumping, figuring out puzzles, killing things, and...

05:05.513 --> 05:15.124
[SPEAKER_04]: Not really much in the collecting stuff, but it's just kind of your normal, you know, like Mario 64 minus all the, you know... Okay, I gotcha, I gotcha.

05:16.345 --> 05:18.848
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, I did have one thing to add that's related to Loki's week.

05:19.008 --> 05:19.309
[SPEAKER_05]: What's that?

05:19.469 --> 05:20.670
[SPEAKER_01]: He gave me Papa Lucros.

05:21.551 --> 05:22.292
[SPEAKER_05]: Ah, for the PSP.

05:22.352 --> 05:24.014
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm going to be playing the hell out of it.

05:24.134 --> 05:26.757
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, well then I expect a full review next week, young lady.

05:27.767 --> 05:28.989
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, ow.

05:29.129 --> 05:31.273
[SPEAKER_01]: I sucked my thumb out and I popped my elbow.

05:31.534 --> 05:32.976
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, if only we were TV sometimes.

05:33.037 --> 05:35.501
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, anything else, Loki?

05:35.622 --> 05:36.583
[SPEAKER_04]: Other than that, no.

05:36.864 --> 05:38.327
[SPEAKER_04]: I haven't planned anything else.

05:39.278 --> 05:44.043
[SPEAKER_05]: I will not be talking about Animal Crossing this week in my gaming week because Animal Crossing got the boot from my DS.

05:44.083 --> 05:44.523
[SPEAKER_05]: Actually, it didn't.

05:44.563 --> 05:54.714
[SPEAKER_05]: It's still sitting there in the top slot, but it's sitting there completely unloved because a new game went into the bottom slot on my DS, and that was Final Fantasy IV Advance I picked up earlier this week.

05:55.575 --> 05:57.277
[SPEAKER_05]: I have not stopped playing it since I got it.

05:57.377 --> 05:57.737
[SPEAKER_05]: And I...

05:58.598 --> 05:59.379
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

06:15.642 --> 06:16.883
[SPEAKER_05]: I really haven't played through it since.

06:16.963 --> 06:28.151
[SPEAKER_05]: I touched on it a little bit when I was on PlayStation in the Final Fantasy Chronicles pack that came out, but I never really got super into it because I couldn't stay on the loading times before the battle, even though it was bad enough.

06:29.633 --> 06:33.535
[SPEAKER_05]: But now, since there are no loading times on this, it's so awesome.

06:33.876 --> 06:40.320
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm rediscovering this classic, classic game, and Final Fantasy IV is a classic title.

06:40.360 --> 06:42.482
[SPEAKER_05]: If you are into role-playing games in any form,

06:42.898 --> 06:54.874
[SPEAKER_05]: you must respect what this game did for future role playing games it is a must play game if you did not play through it before now I'm sure a lot of folks are thinking well what the hell makes this worth buying again if I already had this before

06:55.646 --> 07:09.433
[SPEAKER_05]: and the answer is that the script, which right there ought to sell this because if you played Final Fantasy 2 on Super Nintendo with the original translation, the nice thing is they kept that line intact as a throwback to the fans.

07:09.593 --> 07:12.155
[SPEAKER_05]: It's still you Spoonie Bard because I've gotten through that part of the game.

07:12.455 --> 07:14.336
[SPEAKER_05]: I've put in like five or six hours on that game.

07:14.736 --> 07:18.418
[SPEAKER_05]: Cecil's already a pallet and I'm already like, I've played that game a lot, okay?

07:18.438 --> 07:19.459
[SPEAKER_05]: That's been my week pretty much.

07:21.471 --> 07:28.218
[SPEAKER_05]: But they changed the script to put all the emotion and words and story really back into the game.

07:28.258 --> 07:37.767
[SPEAKER_05]: It's kind of like before, you just had from point A to point B. You had the words that got you from point A to point B, but now it's really fleshed out and the story carries more emotion.

07:38.127 --> 07:43.573
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's amazing when you consider this 2D game is emotional, but it's great.

07:43.693 --> 07:44.634
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't say enough things about it.

07:45.014 --> 07:45.554
[SPEAKER_05]: They put...

07:46.491 --> 07:49.354
[SPEAKER_05]: All the original moves back into it.

07:49.394 --> 07:56.340
[SPEAKER_05]: So a lot of folks, like, you know when you go and you become a paladin for the first time, you have to fight yourself as a Dark Knight.

07:56.380 --> 08:01.165
[SPEAKER_05]: But when you first played it on the Super Nintendo, the Dark Knight did a move, like he did this wavy beam move.

08:01.185 --> 08:02.326
[SPEAKER_05]: And you're like, what the hell?

08:02.546 --> 08:03.707
[SPEAKER_05]: How come I couldn't do that before?

08:04.007 --> 08:05.288
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, now you can.

08:05.389 --> 08:08.111
[SPEAKER_05]: They put that move back in because that was in the original Japanese game.

08:08.151 --> 08:08.852
[SPEAKER_05]: You can do that again.

08:09.172 --> 08:11.174
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's great because they put all these old moves back in.

08:11.903 --> 08:14.104
[SPEAKER_05]: and the game is 14 years old.

08:14.144 --> 08:16.926
[SPEAKER_05]: You probably haven't touched this game in a long time.

08:17.006 --> 08:23.771
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe you have through the use of emulators but I'm betting 95% of the people that listen to this show and play Final Fantasy 2 haven't touched it in the 14 years since.

08:24.431 --> 08:25.992
[SPEAKER_05]: Now's the time to go back and rediscover it.

08:26.432 --> 08:29.694
[SPEAKER_05]: And I know a lot of people are saying why the hell didn't they do this sooner?

08:30.115 --> 08:32.856
[SPEAKER_05]: Why didn't they put this on the Game Boy Advance when the Advance was first out?

08:32.976 --> 08:33.317
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

08:33.337 --> 08:34.137
[SPEAKER_05]: They probably should have.

08:34.437 --> 08:35.238
[SPEAKER_05]: But when you think about it

08:36.061 --> 08:36.642
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

08:48.806 --> 08:51.367
[SPEAKER_05]: Final Fantasy 4 and the awesome game that it is.

08:51.827 --> 08:52.647
[SPEAKER_05]: And now is the chance.

08:52.707 --> 08:54.547
[SPEAKER_05]: And I say seize that opportunity.

08:54.627 --> 08:56.448
[SPEAKER_05]: I give this game my highest recommendation.

08:56.768 --> 09:01.289
[SPEAKER_05]: It is a must play game if you are into role playing games in any capacity.

09:01.369 --> 09:03.190
[SPEAKER_05]: Even if you aren't, you need to give this one a try.

09:03.310 --> 09:07.391
[SPEAKER_04]: Besides, even if you're thinking about it, what else is there to buy that's coming out this month?

09:08.131 --> 09:08.631
[SPEAKER_04]: Gauntlet?

09:10.820 --> 09:11.980
[SPEAKER_05]: I played Gauntlet at E3.

09:12.000 --> 09:14.301
[SPEAKER_05]: It looks okay, but you know what?

09:14.381 --> 09:16.241
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't care about anything else until I beat Final Fantasy 4.

09:16.341 --> 09:16.681
[SPEAKER_05]: And you know what?

09:16.701 --> 09:18.282
[SPEAKER_05]: For the next two weeks, you're probably going to hear me saying this.

09:18.362 --> 09:19.162
[SPEAKER_05]: All I played was Final Fantasy 4.

09:19.762 --> 09:20.882
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry, I have to do this.

09:21.222 --> 09:22.503
[SPEAKER_05]: This is my childhood coming back.

09:22.583 --> 09:27.364
[SPEAKER_01]: To ask you, do you know if it's a port of the WonderSwan version?

09:28.924 --> 09:31.284
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know, because I don't know enough about the WonderSwan version.

09:31.304 --> 09:33.925
[SPEAKER_05]: I can tell you that it is not easy type.

09:34.285 --> 09:38.366
[SPEAKER_05]: It is the original Japanese, because you can...

09:39.761 --> 09:43.362
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry, you don't have a heal potion, you have like the gold needle, the maiden's kiss.

09:43.682 --> 09:44.582
[SPEAKER_05]: Everything is split up like that.

09:45.082 --> 09:46.862
[SPEAKER_05]: Palom and Porom you will be able to bring back.

09:46.902 --> 09:50.283
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the other big catch about this game is that you can switch your characters now.

09:50.343 --> 09:57.624
[SPEAKER_05]: Later in the game, any character that disappeared you couldn't use in the final Zero Mist battle, Edward, Palom, Porom, Yang, you get to bring them all back.

09:57.664 --> 10:00.105
[SPEAKER_05]: They'll be in Mysidia waiting for you to switch out.

10:00.445 --> 10:02.205
[SPEAKER_05]: And apparently there's two new dungeons as well.

10:02.245 --> 10:03.345
[SPEAKER_05]: I haven't even gotten to that point yet.

10:03.365 --> 10:05.206
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm giddy about getting to that point.

10:05.326 --> 10:05.826
[SPEAKER_05]: That's pretty cool.

10:07.006 --> 10:27.718
[SPEAKER_05]: is I remember um because you remember when I was back in my my WonderSwan everything oh yeah oh yeah WonderSwan was I I don't know why they never tried that here but well maybe because Nintendo's so dominating I don't know well I picked up the Final Fantasy the first one the WonderSwan package let's back up a minute because I'm betting that probably a good portion of our listeners don't even know what the hell a WonderSwan is what is a WonderSwan

10:28.251 --> 10:30.853
[SPEAKER_01]: It was Bandai's handheld system.

10:31.253 --> 10:38.977
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, just to point out something, if anyone's ever seen the Street Fighter OAV anime, the one with Sakura and everything, at the end of it, she's playing Street Fighter on a regular WonderSwan.

10:39.618 --> 10:41.279
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a point of reference.

10:41.299 --> 10:43.100
[SPEAKER_05]: But it was not released here in the U.S.

10:43.140 --> 10:43.900
[SPEAKER_05]: It was only in Japan.

10:44.020 --> 10:52.125
[SPEAKER_01]: Right, and when Dan and I found out that we were releasing the first Final Fantasy with a special limited edition WonderSwan, we was like, okay, that's ours.

10:52.445 --> 10:55.247
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought the WonderSwan came out over here very limited.

10:55.487 --> 10:57.448
[SPEAKER_01]: No, that was Neo Geo Pocket Color that we got.

10:57.825 --> 10:58.745
[SPEAKER_04]: No, there was something else.

10:59.226 --> 11:00.966
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe it was Tiger Electronics' thing.

11:00.986 --> 11:02.487
[SPEAKER_04]: They had a portable system, I thought.

11:02.747 --> 11:07.629
[SPEAKER_05]: Regardless, even if it did come out in some limited capacity, I'm betting half our listeners don't even know of its existence.

11:08.289 --> 11:10.691
[SPEAKER_01]: The good Digimon games were on WonderSwan.

11:11.391 --> 11:13.792
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, Rockman and Bass were on...

11:14.696 --> 11:15.437
[SPEAKER_01]: The old WonderSwan.

11:15.837 --> 11:17.279
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's a WonderSwan Crystal out now.

11:17.699 --> 11:23.786
[SPEAKER_05]: So in fact, Final Fantasy 1 and 2 on Game Boy Advance are pretty much just the WonderSwan versions with some minor tweaks.

11:23.806 --> 11:25.688
[SPEAKER_01]: 1, 2, and 4 came out on WonderSwan.

11:25.708 --> 11:29.332
[SPEAKER_01]: They did not bring out 3, which pissed me off so much because that was the one I wanted.

11:29.792 --> 11:32.095
[SPEAKER_01]: It was the first one with the job change system.

11:32.155 --> 11:32.736
[SPEAKER_05]: Right, right.

11:32.756 --> 11:33.737
[SPEAKER_01]: Which is what I love about 5.

11:33.797 --> 11:36.380
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the one that they're going back and tweaking really bad for the DS.

11:36.900 --> 11:42.115
[SPEAKER_05]: and Rumor is that if Final Fantasy IV Advanced sells well, which I think it will, V and VI are pretty much a given.

11:42.155 --> 11:44.702
[SPEAKER_05]: In fact, I thought I read somewhere they're already working on VI.

11:45.635 --> 11:53.763
[SPEAKER_01]: We went back and played 5 on PS2, although I had already been playing an emulated version and I had actually been playing it in Japanese for a little while too.

11:54.444 --> 12:04.333
[SPEAKER_01]: But the good thing about the first one on WonderSwan is that because most of it was in Hiragana, I could sort of read what was going on.

12:04.734 --> 12:07.757
[SPEAKER_01]: I could at least read the spells and I could read the materials, which was easy enough.

12:08.857 --> 12:12.158
[SPEAKER_01]: But it was so pretty and the music was so good.

12:12.218 --> 12:13.479
[SPEAKER_01]: They had completely redone it.

12:13.919 --> 12:17.200
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know that 4 was given the same treatment.

12:17.240 --> 12:23.362
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm wondering... 4, they went back and did, at least on advance, they went back and did some of the graphics.

12:23.402 --> 12:25.162
[SPEAKER_05]: Some of the sprites are cleaned up a little bit.

12:25.663 --> 12:29.824
[SPEAKER_05]: But the music, really, I don't notice that much of a change.

12:29.884 --> 12:32.605
[SPEAKER_05]: It is different, but only slight in some of the instrumentation.

12:32.985 --> 12:34.905
[SPEAKER_05]: To me, I don't notice the difference.

12:35.005 --> 12:36.626
[SPEAKER_05]: But somebody very picky will notice it.

12:36.926 --> 12:45.112
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, also there's the difference between the MIDI synthesizers on the NES and what we got that have to have done it closer to the original.

12:45.752 --> 12:48.174
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, when you're talking about NES versus Advance, yes.

12:48.214 --> 12:51.497
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'm talking about the Famicom versus NES.

12:51.677 --> 12:52.277
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, oh, yeah, yeah.

12:52.297 --> 12:54.779
[SPEAKER_01]: The instrumentation could have very likely been different on the Japanese one.

12:54.799 --> 12:55.680
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely, absolutely.

12:56.660 --> 12:58.422
[SPEAKER_05]: Ooh, that's a lot of Final Fantasy geekery.

12:58.462 --> 12:59.703
[SPEAKER_05]: We better move on to other topics.

12:59.903 --> 13:00.183
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

13:00.583 --> 13:01.063
[SPEAKER_05]: That's all right.

13:01.083 --> 13:02.144
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, that was fun, though.

13:02.685 --> 13:05.867
[SPEAKER_05]: We haven't talked about the WonderSwan yet in like 50 episodes of Orange Lounge, so.

13:06.209 --> 13:06.870
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll bring it one day.

13:32.538 --> 13:36.340
[SPEAKER_01]: Sega is actually coming out with two games for the handheld systems.

13:36.940 --> 13:39.261
[SPEAKER_01]: There's one on the PSP, one on the GBA.

13:39.881 --> 13:43.783
[SPEAKER_01]: The PSP title doesn't have a name yet, but it's being done by Totally Games.

13:44.484 --> 13:48.605
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the studio that did X-Wing vs. TIE Fighter, Secret Weapons Over Normandy.

13:49.906 --> 13:51.547
[SPEAKER_01]: Yay.

13:52.307 --> 13:59.951
[SPEAKER_01]: There's also... They're saying, though, that it's a classic game that they're trying to bring back.

13:59.991 --> 14:00.491
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm wondering...

14:01.593 --> 14:02.874
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly which one it's going to be.

14:03.755 --> 14:05.897
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's been nothing really official listed as the title.

14:06.917 --> 14:10.440
[SPEAKER_05]: To the Sega gods, if you happen to be listening, Echo the Dolphin, please.

14:10.600 --> 14:14.143
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know why that comes to my mind, but I would like to see that come back.

14:14.163 --> 14:17.666
[SPEAKER_01]: The last Echo game we got was on Dreamcast, and it was kind of... It was kind of poop?

14:18.507 --> 14:19.287
[SPEAKER_01]: Not really poop.

14:19.667 --> 14:23.030
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually didn't get to play much of it, but it was... I never really saw it.

14:23.591 --> 14:25.472
[SPEAKER_01]: I heard that it got sort of eh results.

14:25.652 --> 14:26.673
[SPEAKER_05]: How about ToeJam & Earl?

14:26.693 --> 14:28.034
[SPEAKER_05]: That would be kind of cool, too.

14:28.054 --> 14:28.354
[SPEAKER_05]: No, please.

14:28.535 --> 14:28.995
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, come on.

14:30.379 --> 14:32.981
[SPEAKER_05]: They did a ToeJam & Earl 2, but it was poopy, wasn't it?

14:33.602 --> 14:34.322
[SPEAKER_05]: Vectorman!

14:34.342 --> 14:35.603
[SPEAKER_01]: We need Vectorman back!

14:36.004 --> 14:36.244
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway.

14:36.724 --> 14:40.987
[SPEAKER_01]: No, the other one... Oh, actually, there is a little bit more on this.

14:41.108 --> 14:45.831
[SPEAKER_01]: The game was described as a run-and-gun blast-a-thon, quote.

14:45.891 --> 14:48.713
[SPEAKER_01]: It actually makes references to Robotron and Smash TV.

14:50.395 --> 14:51.155
[SPEAKER_01]: More money!

14:51.316 --> 14:52.036
[SPEAKER_01]: More prizes!

14:52.436 --> 14:53.077
[SPEAKER_01]: I love it!

14:54.664 --> 15:00.466
[SPEAKER_01]: The next one is the Tower SP Game Boy exclusive from Vivarium.

15:01.786 --> 15:10.548
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to be quoted as an in-depth sim experience as you design, manage, build everyday running of a skyscraper.

15:11.749 --> 15:16.170
[SPEAKER_01]: You can build a basement or a luxury or...

15:16.937 --> 15:17.277
[SPEAKER_01]: and so on.

15:43.160 --> 15:45.862
[SPEAKER_04]: Smash TV did get a lot of play in my house lately, like in the last week.

16:05.709 --> 16:06.771
[SPEAKER_05]: Isn't that weird?

16:08.413 --> 16:19.848
[SPEAKER_05]: Some of the most talked about Xbox 360 things right now is old shit, like Smash TV, and not so much that Geometry Wars is old shit, but it's pretty shit that you could do on...

16:20.909 --> 16:24.011
[SPEAKER_05]: Old-style consoles, probably, but yet it's so cool and pretty.

16:24.151 --> 16:24.472
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

16:24.532 --> 16:25.813
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like updated asteroids.

16:26.173 --> 16:27.114
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know how to explain it.

16:27.834 --> 16:29.495
[SPEAKER_01]: But back to Sega.

16:29.875 --> 16:30.076
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry.

16:31.016 --> 16:33.918
[SPEAKER_01]: The PSP title, there's not any release date yet.

16:34.038 --> 16:37.080
[SPEAKER_01]: However, the Tower SP is slated for March 2006 release.

16:39.198 --> 16:40.699
[SPEAKER_05]: The Family Entertainment Protection Act

16:56.305 --> 16:59.510
[SPEAKER_05]: Just to follow up, it is now officially before Congress.

17:00.251 --> 17:03.656
[SPEAKER_05]: Granted, it'll probably be one of the first things they pick up when Congress goes back into session.

17:03.736 --> 17:06.320
[SPEAKER_05]: So you'll see some fun debates about this.

17:06.801 --> 17:11.168
[SPEAKER_05]: If you have a very strong position one way or the other on this, I urge you to write.

17:11.448 --> 17:12.109
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for watching!

17:29.830 --> 17:31.511
[SPEAKER_05]: Have a friend proofread it if you're not sure.

17:32.452 --> 17:37.256
[SPEAKER_05]: In other law news, an Alabama judge has said this is denied.

17:37.376 --> 17:42.740
[SPEAKER_05]: It was a lawsuit filed against Take-Two by families of police officers.

17:43.761 --> 17:54.749
[SPEAKER_05]: It was Grand Theft Auto inspired, basically, saying that Grand Theft Auto inspired these kids to kill the cops in the family's suit, Take-Two.

17:55.310 --> 17:56.130
[SPEAKER_05]: It got thrown out.

17:58.103 --> 18:08.787
[SPEAKER_05]: Kind of interesting, Alabama's kind of the home of all this stuff lately because wasn't that also where Jack Thompson's right to practice law kind of got booted out or something?

18:08.807 --> 18:09.187
[SPEAKER_05]: Guess what?

18:09.667 --> 18:10.888
[SPEAKER_05]: This was the same judge.

18:12.668 --> 18:14.169
[SPEAKER_05]: Same judge, Judge James Moore.

18:14.849 --> 18:16.610
[SPEAKER_05]: He must be the only judge in Alabama, I don't know.

18:16.890 --> 18:17.970
[SPEAKER_01]: Bless my home state.

18:17.990 --> 18:22.111
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what's funny is hearing Judge James Moore makes me think of Jay Moore.

18:22.692 --> 18:23.652
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a funny thought.

18:24.349 --> 18:25.471
[SPEAKER_05]: Give this guy a TV show.

18:25.491 --> 18:26.954
[SPEAKER_05]: This is the judge I want to see on TV.

18:26.994 --> 18:31.122
[SPEAKER_01]: He absolutely gets major kudos for me.

18:31.222 --> 18:33.146
[SPEAKER_01]: It makes me proud to be an Alabamian.

18:34.088 --> 18:34.368
Yep.

18:34.809 --> 18:35.591
[SPEAKER_01]: Makes my heart hurt.

18:37.283 --> 18:38.984
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, let's move on.

18:39.344 --> 18:41.705
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki, what do you got for us tonight?

18:42.125 --> 18:43.305
[SPEAKER_05]: Talk to me a little bit about 360.

18:43.705 --> 18:44.125
[SPEAKER_05]: Tell us about 360.

18:44.546 --> 18:49.447
[SPEAKER_05]: First off, I know this wasn't on your list, but what happened with the Best Buy thing?

18:49.487 --> 18:53.489
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, there was the list on the internet that said that all these Best Buys are going to have the game.

18:53.529 --> 18:53.989
[SPEAKER_05]: What happened?

18:54.069 --> 18:58.250
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, the whole drama behind the Best Buy thing is this basically was like a second launch.

18:58.290 --> 19:03.572
[SPEAKER_04]: There was supposed to be about 300,000 units being sent throughout the entire United States.

19:04.682 --> 19:07.083
[SPEAKER_04]: So, same kind of allocations they were getting before.

19:08.424 --> 19:10.745
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, here are the rules for this.

19:11.205 --> 19:13.486
[SPEAKER_04]: They were receiving their shipments on Friday.

19:13.506 --> 19:17.008
[SPEAKER_04]: They were supposed to hold them for Sunday for their sale that was going to be advertised.

19:17.028 --> 19:18.368
[SPEAKER_04]: They were not to pre-sell them.

19:18.748 --> 19:19.889
[SPEAKER_04]: They were not to open early.

19:21.701 --> 19:22.461
[SPEAKER_04]: Did they follow that?

19:22.561 --> 19:22.761
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

19:23.001 --> 19:27.203
[SPEAKER_04]: They sold them early, they opened early, people were disappointed.

19:27.343 --> 19:30.383
[SPEAKER_05]: When you say they select stores, because we can't pinpoint who did it.

19:30.403 --> 19:38.446
[SPEAKER_04]: Select stores opened early and sold early, and so people were camping in line, and from what I hear too, some stores didn't even get them.

19:38.926 --> 19:43.187
[SPEAKER_04]: And so people were camping in line, and they get up there, oh, by the way, they're sold out.

19:43.507 --> 19:45.608
[SPEAKER_04]: Would you like a compact laptop instead?

19:46.128 --> 19:50.369
[SPEAKER_04]: So it was basically a lot of, you know, crap that

19:51.345 --> 19:51.985
[SPEAKER_04]: Hit the fan.

19:52.926 --> 19:53.706
[SPEAKER_04]: It wasn't pretty.

19:53.946 --> 19:57.768
[SPEAKER_04]: And a lot of people waited in line and some of them did get them.

19:58.248 --> 19:59.169
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of people did not.

19:59.489 --> 20:02.551
[SPEAKER_04]: People still pissed at Microsoft.

20:02.971 --> 20:08.413
[SPEAKER_04]: But this is going to happen all over again because apparently another shipment is coming in on the 22nd.

20:09.674 --> 20:10.134
[SPEAKER_05]: Interesting.

20:10.995 --> 20:13.716
[SPEAKER_04]: So, yeah, it's pretty bad.

20:13.796 --> 20:15.497
[SPEAKER_04]: But, you know...

20:16.761 --> 20:18.203
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for watching!

20:38.334 --> 20:39.695
[SPEAKER_04]: Death or Alive Death or Alive

21:00.422 --> 21:02.665
[SPEAKER_04]: to launch that people were really looking forward to.

21:02.725 --> 21:05.548
[SPEAKER_04]: Ridge Racer was the top game for the Japanese market.

21:05.988 --> 21:12.875
[SPEAKER_04]: And then, of course, their RPGs like 99 Nights, well, sort of a Dynasty Warriors type game.

21:13.156 --> 21:18.641
[SPEAKER_04]: And then Enchanted Arm, the really big RPGs, they aren't coming out until next year.

21:20.263 --> 21:20.684
[SPEAKER_04]: So it sucks.

21:22.311 --> 21:23.711
[SPEAKER_05]: What else is going on in 360 News?

21:24.352 --> 21:31.793
[SPEAKER_04]: Other than that, they do have some really cool stuff that they've added to the Xbox Live Marketplace, which is really good.

21:31.933 --> 21:34.993
[SPEAKER_04]: Some new content, new cars to download for Ridge Racer 6.

21:36.074 --> 21:36.974
[SPEAKER_04]: Those are all free.

21:37.774 --> 21:48.776
[SPEAKER_04]: They're going to actually be adding a demo for Full Auto coming pretty soon, I think in this week or so, and I'm really looking forward to that, which is going to be awesome.

21:49.508 --> 21:55.653
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, I read about this, and I thought this sounded pretty cool, that the Xbox 360 is actually having a high-definition trailer for Mission Impossible 3.

21:56.454 --> 21:59.356
[SPEAKER_05]: It's available on the Xbox Live Marketplace, and you can download this.

21:59.416 --> 22:03.879
[SPEAKER_05]: It's some type of exclusive trailer thing that you can download.

22:03.960 --> 22:04.800
[SPEAKER_05]: Very interesting.

22:04.840 --> 22:11.846
[SPEAKER_05]: Kind of buys into that whole, the 360 and the next-gen systems may be more than a gaming system.

22:12.366 --> 22:13.187
[SPEAKER_04]: They're trying.

22:13.487 --> 22:14.968
[SPEAKER_04]: They did that with Narnia.

22:15.068 --> 22:17.050
[SPEAKER_04]: They had a trailer for Narnia on there and stuff.

22:18.011 --> 22:20.292
[SPEAKER_04]: I've seen the Mission Impossible 3 trailer.

22:20.332 --> 22:21.973
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just a teaser, and it's like, eh.

22:22.574 --> 22:23.194
[SPEAKER_05]: But think about that.

22:23.234 --> 22:28.138
[SPEAKER_05]: If you can download the trailer on the marketplace, what's to stop them later on from offering movies for download on the marketplace?

22:28.158 --> 22:28.858
[SPEAKER_05]: True, they could.

22:28.998 --> 22:31.780
[SPEAKER_05]: I see that as a logical next step for what the system's going to do.

22:32.120 --> 22:33.221
[SPEAKER_05]: And Sony, same thing.

22:34.582 --> 22:35.203
[SPEAKER_04]: I wouldn't doubt it.

22:35.503 --> 22:36.784
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it makes sense.

22:37.697 --> 22:41.098
[SPEAKER_04]: And I really do like the way they have the games online for free download.

22:41.218 --> 22:42.278
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, that's really good.

22:42.318 --> 22:43.639
[SPEAKER_04]: They try out the demos and stuff.

22:44.259 --> 22:48.380
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's great, and it'll really help them sell their games.

22:48.960 --> 22:50.920
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a really good tool that they have on there.

22:51.201 --> 22:53.181
[SPEAKER_04]: And plus, the extra content is really awesome.

22:54.301 --> 22:56.402
[SPEAKER_04]: I do like the fact that they have downloadable stuff.

22:56.742 --> 22:59.883
[SPEAKER_04]: Plus, you can pay for other things, like they have some extra sound...

23:01.138 --> 23:02.720
[SPEAKER_04]: Music Tracks for Ridge Racer

23:21.637 --> 23:25.238
[SPEAKER_04]: The first one was this one entitled the Extreme Edition.

23:25.578 --> 23:32.601
[SPEAKER_04]: Basically, they've done a red paint job on it, added a nice little window to it, and changed all the LEDs to red, which looks pretty cool.

23:32.681 --> 23:36.762
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's actually being sold on eBay for thousands of dollars.

23:37.963 --> 23:45.925
[SPEAKER_04]: Then the other one, which is less practical and less cool, would be a 360 being put inside of an Atari 2600.

23:46.005 --> 23:48.806
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, I think that's pretty cool.

23:49.446 --> 23:50.927
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, you have to see it

23:51.351 --> 23:53.472
[SPEAKER_04]: To understand how... It looks ugly.

23:53.812 --> 23:54.293
[SPEAKER_05]: Ugly as hell.

23:54.533 --> 23:56.114
[SPEAKER_04]: It is pretty damn ugly.

23:57.094 --> 24:01.437
[SPEAKER_04]: But, you know, hey, give people time, they'll put it in anything.

24:01.457 --> 24:07.760
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't praise the modding community enough, but damn, they can be creative sometimes.

24:07.800 --> 24:08.300
[SPEAKER_05]: Seriously.

24:08.380 --> 24:12.103
[SPEAKER_05]: Not just... Just the modding and cracking and hacking scene in general.

24:12.203 --> 24:15.084
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, damn, there's some creative things people come up with.

24:15.144 --> 24:16.945
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like, why the hell would you do that?

24:17.265 --> 24:18.646
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I can.

24:19.567 --> 24:20.087
[SPEAKER_05]: Exactly.

24:21.587 --> 24:22.488
[SPEAKER_05]: Why would you put a 360 in the 2600?

24:44.389 --> 24:53.475
[SPEAKER_05]: Microsoft in both America and Japan has not announced anything regarding the possibility of a next generation DVD drive being placed in the Xbox 360.

24:53.515 --> 24:55.076
[SPEAKER_05]: This coming from a Microsoft spokesperson.

24:55.616 --> 25:00.599
[SPEAKER_05]: There are currently no plans to release an Xbox 360 equipped with a next generation DVD player.

25:02.180 --> 25:02.381
[SPEAKER_04]: Yet.

25:02.401 --> 25:04.662
[SPEAKER_05]: Makes sense because... I added the yet myself, but yet.

25:04.882 --> 25:08.465
[SPEAKER_04]: Makes sense because HD DVD, we don't even know if that's the format they're going to be going to.

25:09.705 --> 25:11.787
[SPEAKER_05]: Completely random subject here, but I don't care.

25:11.867 --> 25:12.947
[SPEAKER_05]: It's one of those shows tonight.

25:12.967 --> 25:13.228
[SPEAKER_05]: Um...

25:14.698 --> 25:21.980
[SPEAKER_05]: I helped my friend go shopping for a Christmas present and my friend was buying a DVD recorder for a friend and there's all these recording formats.

25:22.020 --> 25:27.542
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know much about it but there's like the R's, the RW, the R pluses or whatever.

25:27.982 --> 25:34.424
[SPEAKER_05]: All these things and they're like all these different formats and no standardization and these recorders are huge Christmas things.

25:34.444 --> 25:38.285
[SPEAKER_05]: This is kind of dangerous because it's like VHS and beta all over again.

25:38.325 --> 25:39.245
[SPEAKER_05]: We need to find a standard.

25:39.605 --> 25:42.926
[SPEAKER_04]: The actual standalone recorders, there's

25:43.373 --> 25:47.894
[SPEAKER_04]: They have the plus and the minus, and then the R, plus or minus R is what it is.

25:47.914 --> 25:51.295
[SPEAKER_05]: See, I couldn't make sense of all of it because they all sound too similar for me.

25:51.395 --> 25:52.835
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, they are very similar.

25:52.895 --> 25:56.476
[SPEAKER_04]: Plus and minus R are very similar, and then RW is just a rewritable one.

25:56.516 --> 25:59.777
[SPEAKER_05]: Not similar enough because one won't play on the other, depending on the machine.

25:59.817 --> 26:00.477
[SPEAKER_01]: Some will play both.

26:00.577 --> 26:07.539
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, mine will actually play both, like on the burner on my laptop, but I think it only records on plus R's.

26:07.924 --> 26:11.967
[SPEAKER_04]: I think PlusR has been the format that's actually what's being used now.

26:12.007 --> 26:18.092
[SPEAKER_04]: I know my DVD burner and my computer will do both, but it burns basically one format.

26:18.132 --> 26:18.892
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm behind the times.

26:18.932 --> 26:21.054
[SPEAKER_05]: I have no DVD burner recorder or any of that stuff.

26:21.774 --> 26:22.555
[SPEAKER_04]: You're not missing much.

26:23.316 --> 26:29.140
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, it's helped me out so much because I have a 250 gig hard drive on my PC that's almost full.

26:29.941 --> 26:31.422
[SPEAKER_05]: See, mine's not even near full yet.

26:31.542 --> 26:38.127
[SPEAKER_01]: But I can just go onto my network, burn off my stuff off of my laptop, save myself some space.

26:38.548 --> 26:38.868
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright.

26:39.288 --> 26:41.090
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, let's, okay, enough 360 talk.

26:41.890 --> 26:44.652
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, you have a story about another next-gen console.

26:44.693 --> 26:45.153
[SPEAKER_05]: What's going on?

26:45.785 --> 26:47.768
[SPEAKER_01]: Finally, some more stuff about the revolution.

26:48.649 --> 26:56.761
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, apparently the system has been, some dev kits have been released to some third parties, so there's been some feedback received.

26:58.063 --> 27:02.129
[SPEAKER_01]: So far, it's looking like, just the information that's been given back.

27:02.869 --> 27:08.312
[SPEAKER_01]: This is going to be powered by IBM CPU codenamed Broadway, very similar to the Gecko CPU in the GameCube.

27:09.653 --> 27:17.758
[SPEAKER_01]: It should run about twice the clock speed, actually up to three times the overall performance of the GameCube processor.

27:18.759 --> 27:23.942
[SPEAKER_01]: And they have an HCI graphics chip codenamed Hollywood, which I find so ridiculous.

27:23.962 --> 27:24.302
[SPEAKER_05]: Interesting.

27:24.482 --> 27:24.882
[SPEAKER_05]: Interesting.

27:28.260 --> 27:39.367
[SPEAKER_01]: Just to look at this yet though, they're saying that it's going to be about two and a half times more powerful than the GameCube, which is... The GameCube wasn't too bad at all.

27:40.588 --> 27:50.213
[SPEAKER_01]: There's also a note on here that it's going to pretty much use standard DVDs, but as a slot loader, it will actually be able to take in the old GameCube discs.

27:50.494 --> 27:51.034
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, okay, cool.

27:52.425 --> 28:04.399
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that that's actually pretty cool because the small discs, there hasn't been anything slot loading that would take those without some type of special tray to go with it.

28:04.419 --> 28:06.762
[SPEAKER_01]: The thing is that developers don't really know how to treat it.

28:07.423 --> 28:15.213
[SPEAKER_01]: They're talking about it being easy to program for though on a PC and you actually do more enhancements to it when you're porting it over.

28:16.475 --> 28:22.243
[SPEAKER_01]: But right now they've just been treating it like they're programming a GameCube game because the library is very similar.

28:24.285 --> 28:29.047
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, this whole news about the more powerful and stuff, it's all fine and good, but I'm not big on specs.

28:29.287 --> 28:35.849
[SPEAKER_05]: And I know a lot of our listeners are really big on specs, and they want to know exactly what the systems will do, but guys, remember the golden rule of gaming.

28:35.909 --> 28:36.869
[SPEAKER_05]: Everybody say it with me.

28:37.509 --> 28:41.430
[SPEAKER_05]: A system is only as good as the games that are on it.

28:41.490 --> 28:45.851
[SPEAKER_05]: So this thing could have rocket fuel, projection, lightning, laser, whatever.

28:46.992 --> 28:47.732
[SPEAKER_05]: If the games suck...

28:48.271 --> 28:48.771
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

29:03.872 --> 29:10.000
[SPEAKER_05]: That would be, I think, the smartest thing Nintendo could do if they were going to come in the market last, come in cheapest, make everybody else price slash.

29:10.080 --> 29:18.049
[SPEAKER_01]: What surprises me, though, is the fact that they'd go with the standard format DVD, because Nintendo has been all about having their own storage system.

29:20.115 --> 29:25.138
[SPEAKER_01]: They made their money on the 64 with those humongous cartridges they had.

29:25.198 --> 29:31.601
[SPEAKER_05]: See, I think part of the reason they lost with the GameCube, or at least came in last place in America with the GameCube, is because it didn't support DVDs.

29:31.661 --> 29:33.903
[SPEAKER_05]: And honestly... That's what pushed Square away.

29:34.143 --> 29:35.083
[SPEAKER_05]: I've said this before.

29:35.484 --> 29:41.747
[SPEAKER_05]: I think the reason why PlayStation 2 dominated the way it did is because people were buying them as DVD players.

29:42.347 --> 29:45.529
[SPEAKER_05]: Even though, you know, the first gen, they say you weren't supposed to, whatever.

29:45.933 --> 29:46.353
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

30:09.502 --> 30:11.683
[SPEAKER_01]: The backwards compatibility was a big thing.

30:11.883 --> 30:13.743
[SPEAKER_01]: However, I did find it very hilarious.

30:13.803 --> 30:17.105
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that it's the Japanese one that had more issues with this than the U.S.

30:17.265 --> 30:17.365
[SPEAKER_01]: one.

30:18.065 --> 30:24.147
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that if you had on your texture smoothing, it would do very interesting things to some of the older games.

30:24.727 --> 30:30.309
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, I remember playing Bust a Move 2 with texture smoothing on, and Comet's head disappeared.

30:31.690 --> 30:32.450
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of her legs.

30:33.890 --> 30:36.491
[SPEAKER_05]: She can't really bust a move with only one leg now, can she?

30:36.531 --> 30:37.832
[SPEAKER_04]: Or without a head, yeah.

30:37.932 --> 30:38.572
[SPEAKER_01]: It was pretty funny.

30:40.110 --> 30:44.832
[SPEAKER_05]: Random, random, not related to anything comments, because we're talking about losing heads and stuff.

30:44.852 --> 30:47.934
[SPEAKER_05]: Somebody actually put a Photoshop in the MySpace, because you don't have people on MySpace.

30:47.954 --> 30:49.894
[SPEAKER_05]: They leave these comments that are just completely random.

30:50.455 --> 30:56.517
[SPEAKER_05]: One of my buddies actually put a comment on my MySpace that says, France, France, revolution, and it just shows the DDR cover with no head.

30:56.577 --> 30:57.458
[SPEAKER_05]: The head's on the ground.

30:57.538 --> 30:57.838
[SPEAKER_05]: Get it?

30:57.918 --> 30:59.658
[SPEAKER_05]: Because in France, they beheaded people.

31:00.019 --> 31:00.759
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, what is that?

31:02.702 --> 31:03.442
[SPEAKER_05]: Something in the air tonight.

31:03.462 --> 31:04.723
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it was those brownies you brought over.

31:04.743 --> 31:06.144
[SPEAKER_05]: Are you sure those were Starbucks brownies?

31:06.404 --> 31:08.085
[SPEAKER_01]: They were Starbucks brownies.

31:08.165 --> 31:10.946
[SPEAKER_01]: They have caffeine in them and Starbucks makes you stupid.

31:12.968 --> 31:15.889
[SPEAKER_01]: We are never getting sponsorship from Starbucks.

31:15.929 --> 31:16.389
[SPEAKER_05]: Good job.

31:16.570 --> 31:17.110
[SPEAKER_05]: Good job on that.

31:18.090 --> 31:20.872
[SPEAKER_05]: I think now is a good time in the show to talk about...

31:22.296 --> 31:22.837
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura.com

31:50.407 --> 31:52.451
[SPEAKER_01]: How to Survive a High-Rise Hotel Fire

32:01.055 --> 32:03.416
[SPEAKER_01]: Feel the hotel doorknob with the back of your hand.

32:03.937 --> 32:09.540
[SPEAKER_01]: If the knob is cool, open the door and escape via the nearest stairwell, keeping low with the hallway of smoke filled.

32:09.880 --> 32:11.181
[SPEAKER_01]: Duh.

32:11.201 --> 32:11.181
2.

32:11.922 --> 32:15.284
[SPEAKER_01]: If the doorknob is hot, wedge wet towels under the door to keep smoke out.

32:15.704 --> 32:19.206
[SPEAKER_01]: Cover your head with wet towels and sheets to protect yourself from smoke inhalation.

32:19.606 --> 32:22.488
[SPEAKER_01]: You can also use the towel to signal rescue personnel at the window.

32:23.488 --> 32:22.488
3.

32:24.029 --> 32:27.531
[SPEAKER_01]: If the air is getting worse, try to kick through the closet wall into the adjacent room.

32:28.297 --> 32:34.181
[SPEAKER_01]: Knock on the wall until you hear a hollow sound which indicates the absence of wall studs and then use both feet to kick through the drywall.

32:34.862 --> 32:36.763
[SPEAKER_01]: But my final piece of advice on this one?

32:36.963 --> 32:37.184
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.

32:37.604 --> 32:44.489
[SPEAKER_01]: If you see a little sign outside the hotel that says now filming The Towering Inferno Part 2, stay somewhere else.

32:45.210 --> 32:46.010
[SPEAKER_01]: Good thoughts.

32:46.090 --> 32:49.913
[SPEAKER_04]: Or how about don't play with fire indoors?

32:50.293 --> 32:51.454
[SPEAKER_01]: Or unplug your Christmas tree.

32:51.955 --> 32:53.796
[SPEAKER_04]: Or stay in a hotel on the first floor.

32:55.477 --> 32:56.138
[SPEAKER_05]: Stay at Motel 6.

32:57.591 --> 32:58.131
[SPEAKER_01]: We had tiny rooms.

32:58.151 --> 32:58.432
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway.

33:22.952 --> 33:23.992
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki, give us a story.

33:24.032 --> 33:24.593
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't care what.

33:24.653 --> 33:25.593
[SPEAKER_05]: Take us away from this.

33:29.474 --> 33:45.539
[SPEAKER_04]: On the topic of Crack Horse, we have... It was actually brought to everyone's attention again, this old mod that was out for the original Zelda, a ROM that's been floating around on the internet called Zelda Challenge The Outlands, and it's been...

33:46.604 --> 33:47.004
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura

34:03.695 --> 34:03.975
[SPEAKER_05]: and so on.

34:25.902 --> 34:34.227
[SPEAKER_05]: The best worst mod I ever saw was an old Japanese game, it's called Nuts and Milk, and they never released it here for obvious reasons, because teehee nuts, right?

34:34.487 --> 34:39.370
[SPEAKER_05]: Well somebody actually went in and teehee nuts, they turned all the characters into, you know, nuts.

34:40.555 --> 34:45.078
[SPEAKER_05]: and the milk was, you know, that gross.

34:45.138 --> 34:57.446
[SPEAKER_01]: I downloaded Link's Awakening, the old Game Boy one, and I didn't find out until after I started playing it that it had been hacked, and his sword was like a dildo, and all the text had been changed.

34:57.506 --> 34:58.146
[SPEAKER_01]: That's so classy.

34:59.207 --> 35:03.790
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyways, this one has more dungeons, in fact, new weapons and whatnot.

35:04.430 --> 35:07.352
[SPEAKER_04]: Pretty cool, so you should go definitely check it out.

35:07.592 --> 35:08.953
[SPEAKER_04]: You can probably find it on the

35:09.505 --> 35:10.926
[SPEAKER_04]: Any ROM sites out there.

35:11.506 --> 35:13.347
[SPEAKER_04]: Zelda Challenge Outworld.

35:13.367 --> 35:15.348
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, check that out.

35:15.388 --> 35:17.149
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, you have some news about Quake 4.

35:17.669 --> 35:18.690
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep, I sure do.

35:19.250 --> 35:20.771
[SPEAKER_01]: Little tiny piece of news.

35:23.612 --> 35:28.735
[SPEAKER_01]: Aspire has taken pity on Mac users.

35:29.615 --> 35:33.497
[SPEAKER_01]: Quake 4 will be coming out for the Mac next year, sometime.

35:34.258 --> 35:36.899
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to be available for both PowerPC and Intel Macs.

35:37.674 --> 35:38.635
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

36:04.628 --> 36:07.170
[SPEAKER_01]: And actually, one of our listeners linked this to us.

36:07.310 --> 36:07.790
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, super.

36:08.230 --> 36:10.092
[SPEAKER_01]: Our fabulous Robway.

36:10.692 --> 36:11.352
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, of course.

36:11.613 --> 36:13.214
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

36:13.994 --> 36:20.518
[SPEAKER_01]: And it really goes into detail on these, but I'll just try to, I guess, summarize as best as I can.

36:21.979 --> 36:23.020
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you have a link to this?

36:23.060 --> 36:24.641
[SPEAKER_05]: Is this a quick link that you can read out?

36:24.661 --> 36:25.502
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I can read it out.

36:25.602 --> 36:32.807
[SPEAKER_01]: It's pbs.org slash kcts slash videogamerevolution slash impact slash myths.html.

36:33.737 --> 36:35.558
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, you might have to post that on the forums too, but that's interesting.

36:35.578 --> 36:37.718
[SPEAKER_05]: PBS, like public broadcasting system.

36:37.758 --> 36:38.078
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess.

36:38.219 --> 36:38.679
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, interesting.

36:38.719 --> 36:38.979
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

36:40.279 --> 36:48.242
[SPEAKER_01]: But the first one is that the availability of video games has led to an epidemic of youth violence, and basically it's, like we talked about before, that's totally not the case.

36:50.022 --> 36:58.745
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, the overwhelming majority, just to quote here, the overwhelming majority of kids who do not commit antisocial acts, they're talking about that...

37:02.035 --> 37:09.980
[SPEAKER_01]: All those reports that came back with some of our national facilities have proven that no, that's really not true.

37:10.000 --> 37:14.582
[SPEAKER_05]: Video games can be a very social thing sometimes.

37:14.602 --> 37:17.004
[SPEAKER_05]: Seriously, get a full game of Mario Party going.

37:17.577 --> 37:19.518
[SPEAKER_05]: You'll see more social... Forget it.

37:19.918 --> 37:20.358
[SPEAKER_05]: Go ahead.

37:20.578 --> 37:26.761
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, number two, Scientific Evidence links video games play with youth aggression.

37:27.782 --> 37:33.884
[SPEAKER_01]: But the studies that they've done have been really inconclusive.

37:35.005 --> 37:36.946
[SPEAKER_01]: Their methodology has been criticized.

37:37.966 --> 37:40.047
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not thorough research.

37:41.395 --> 37:50.382
[SPEAKER_01]: There's also, they're not accounting for, it's mentioned on here, the risk factor coupled with more immediate real world influences.

37:51.162 --> 37:59.609
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, pretty much you learn violence is, I'd say it's actually a more instinctive human trait.

38:00.689 --> 38:09.516
[SPEAKER_01]: If somebody is going to be more prone to violent behavior, it's going to be a combination of home influence and biological predisposition.

38:10.316 --> 38:13.159
[SPEAKER_01]: 3.

38:10.336 --> 38:13.159
[SPEAKER_01]: Children are the primary market for video games.

38:23.502 --> 38:26.245
[SPEAKER_05]: Most of the games marketed though are for the older gamer.

38:26.265 --> 38:27.726
[SPEAKER_05]: For almost no girls play video games, high bullshit.

38:49.442 --> 38:56.330
[SPEAKER_01]: 5.

38:49.542 --> 38:56.330
[SPEAKER_01]: Because games are used to train soldiers to kill, they have the same impact on kids who play them.

39:00.215 --> 39:06.223
[SPEAKER_01]: Former military psychologist and moral reformer David Grossman argues that because the military uses games in training...

39:07.190 --> 39:10.153
[SPEAKER_01]: including, he claims, training soldiers to shoot and kill.

39:10.194 --> 39:16.981
[SPEAKER_01]: The generation of young people who play such games are primarily being brutalized and conditioned to be aggressive in their everyday social interactions.

39:17.482 --> 39:23.609
[SPEAKER_01]: Now this says his model only works if we remove training and education from a meaningful cultural context.

39:24.318 --> 39:28.559
[SPEAKER_01]: We assume leaders have no conscious goals and that they show no resistance to what they are being taught.

39:28.759 --> 39:29.399
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sorry, learners.

39:30.140 --> 39:35.221
[SPEAKER_01]: We assume they unwittingly apply what they've learned in a fantasy environment to real world aspects.

39:36.701 --> 39:36.841
[SPEAKER_01]: No.

39:38.101 --> 39:39.942
[SPEAKER_01]: And I agree with the rest of this.

39:39.982 --> 39:49.904
[SPEAKER_01]: It's basically pointing out that the games for training military are specifically geared toward training and they know that it is geared toward their training.

39:50.665 --> 39:51.945
[SPEAKER_01]: For a child playing a game,

39:52.481 --> 39:53.761
[SPEAKER_01]: In their head, it's a game.

39:53.922 --> 39:55.822
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't have to go out and kill somebody the next day.

39:56.102 --> 39:58.763
[SPEAKER_05]: Let me throw this out there, just kind of a discussion item.

39:59.364 --> 40:00.044
[SPEAKER_05]: America's Army.

40:02.285 --> 40:04.886
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that that's more of an enlistment tool.

40:06.026 --> 40:08.727
[SPEAKER_05]: I know a lot of people that play this just for the game, though.

40:08.747 --> 40:10.408
[SPEAKER_05]: It had nothing to do with the enlistment aspect of it.

40:10.448 --> 40:12.028
[SPEAKER_05]: It's actually a really popular game.

40:12.048 --> 40:14.049
[SPEAKER_05]: It kind of has a very cult-like following to it.

40:14.869 --> 40:15.789
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got my copies.

40:16.010 --> 40:18.570
[SPEAKER_05]: I just thought I'd throw that out there because it's kind of a fusion of what you're talking about.

40:18.630 --> 40:19.991
[SPEAKER_05]: Any other of those bullet points you want to bring up?

40:21.405 --> 40:25.587
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, actually, no, I wanted to move on to the next one here.

40:26.127 --> 40:28.669
[SPEAKER_01]: Video games are not a meaningful form of expression.

40:31.770 --> 40:32.810
[SPEAKER_05]: What about Mario Paint?

40:32.911 --> 40:34.751
[SPEAKER_05]: I expressed a lot in that game.

40:35.912 --> 40:39.594
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, the thing is, is that not all games are violent.

40:40.134 --> 40:43.736
[SPEAKER_01]: We have, like, you're talking about Final Fantasy IV having a beautiful story.

40:43.876 --> 40:44.236
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah.

40:44.696 --> 40:48.978
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, that's just a really narrow-minded... You know, as far as, like, say, for example...

40:49.659 --> 40:53.701
[SPEAKER_01]: When you play The Sims, that's actually very expressive.

40:53.721 --> 40:55.762
[SPEAKER_01]: You control the people's lives in there.

40:55.822 --> 40:57.983
[SPEAKER_01]: You can have them interact.

40:59.144 --> 41:00.704
[SPEAKER_01]: What about your online games?

41:01.845 --> 41:03.446
[SPEAKER_01]: There's plenty of room for expression.

41:04.506 --> 41:08.248
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, hell, MMOs are all about expression half the time.

41:09.489 --> 41:12.190
[SPEAKER_01]: Seven, video game play is socially isolating.

41:12.690 --> 41:13.591
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi, MMOs again.

41:15.742 --> 41:16.962
[SPEAKER_01]: We have friends over at our house.

41:16.982 --> 41:21.345
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, but that can go either way because some people can sit on an MMO all day long.

41:21.385 --> 41:30.089
[SPEAKER_05]: Of course, we've heard those horrible stories coming out of many different places about that folks die from forgetting to eat and drink from playing their MMOs all day.

41:30.189 --> 41:33.791
[SPEAKER_05]: So that can kind of go either way, but games don't.

41:34.981 --> 41:39.725
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, there's a comment on here that, in fact, I'll just read a little bit of it.

41:40.145 --> 41:40.926
[SPEAKER_01]: You're doing it all wrong!

41:40.986 --> 41:41.646
[SPEAKER_01]: Ha ha ha ha!

41:58.683 --> 41:59.023
[SPEAKER_01]: Smash Bros.

42:22.508 --> 42:29.252
[SPEAKER_01]: Video game play is desensitizing.

42:29.832 --> 42:37.037
[SPEAKER_01]: Classic study of play behavior among primates suggests that apes make basic distinction between play fighting and actual combat.

42:39.398 --> 42:39.999
[SPEAKER_01]: We're not monkeys.

42:43.311 --> 42:50.934
[SPEAKER_01]: But still, this is, I think that having the game here, and this actually mentions a little bit of this, that it's an outlet.

42:55.136 --> 43:02.200
[SPEAKER_01]: It can be used to let out this aggression that's within people so that you're better able to cope with the real world.

43:02.620 --> 43:08.362
[SPEAKER_01]: They're wanting to prove that playing a violent game makes you more violent outside.

43:08.622 --> 43:09.663
[SPEAKER_01]: Was this a TV show?

43:10.399 --> 43:11.759
[SPEAKER_05]: Because it's on PBS.org.

43:11.799 --> 43:12.940
[SPEAKER_05]: Was this a TV special?

43:13.240 --> 43:13.480
[SPEAKER_01]: I know.

43:13.620 --> 43:14.020
[SPEAKER_05]: It should be.

43:14.060 --> 43:14.520
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think so.

43:14.640 --> 43:14.920
[SPEAKER_01]: It should be.

43:14.940 --> 43:15.620
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think it should be.

43:15.980 --> 43:18.381
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that it should be broadcast on every freaking channel.

43:18.401 --> 43:20.541
[SPEAKER_05]: There should be an episode of Penn & Teller's bullshit right here.

43:21.942 --> 43:22.422
[SPEAKER_01]: About video games.

43:22.442 --> 43:23.582
[SPEAKER_01]: It should be on 60 Minutes.

43:24.562 --> 43:25.162
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a good point.

43:25.262 --> 43:25.502
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway.

43:25.882 --> 43:35.805
[SPEAKER_01]: But at any rate, you know, their whole argument with this one is that you would basically lose empathy for real world situations by experiencing them in a virtual environment.

43:36.585 --> 43:37.085
[SPEAKER_01]: Not the case.

43:38.152 --> 43:45.838
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, by giving yourself an outlet in one forum, I think that it would make a person better able to cope in a real forum.

43:48.600 --> 43:52.663
[SPEAKER_05]: Interesting discussions that that article kind of invokes there.

43:52.703 --> 43:53.944
[SPEAKER_05]: So thank you for sharing with us.

43:53.964 --> 43:54.664
[SPEAKER_01]: That was a very good one.

43:54.704 --> 43:56.326
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, we need to thank our buddy Rob.

43:56.566 --> 43:56.806
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

43:56.846 --> 43:57.887
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, buddy Rob.

43:59.448 --> 44:02.150
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki, let's go from all that.

44:02.310 --> 44:03.511
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's talk about a good old war game.

44:03.731 --> 44:04.672
[SPEAKER_04]: Tell us about Gears of War.

44:05.762 --> 44:06.262
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's the worst.

44:06.362 --> 44:06.883
[SPEAKER_04]: Sexy.

44:07.203 --> 44:08.204
[SPEAKER_04]: That's all you need to know.

44:08.684 --> 44:16.929
[SPEAKER_04]: No, actually, they released some footage from, I believe it was Zero Hour, where they were showing off the game, and it's sexy.

44:17.910 --> 44:21.352
[SPEAKER_04]: This right here is the killer app for the 360.

44:22.873 --> 44:23.414
[SPEAKER_04]: Definitely.

44:25.115 --> 44:28.557
[SPEAKER_04]: What they did show is just the amazing graphics in it, as well as...

44:30.792 --> 44:33.453
[SPEAKER_04]: Kind of different things that they're doing with the storyline stuff.

44:33.513 --> 44:34.053
[SPEAKER_04]: It's really cool.

44:36.114 --> 44:40.396
[SPEAKER_04]: But that's one you're definitely going to be wanting to check out when it comes out.

44:40.416 --> 44:42.537
[SPEAKER_04]: I believe in April or March.

44:43.677 --> 44:44.357
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, sounds good.

44:45.458 --> 44:48.939
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's go ahead and open up the old mailbag and see what our listeners have to say.

44:49.019 --> 44:58.183
[SPEAKER_05]: Remember guys, if you want to send us an email, all you've got to do is write us togoto at orangeloungeradio.com and DarkSakura will...

44:59.386 --> 45:00.767
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

45:23.980 --> 45:25.241
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't we have something on forums for that now?

45:25.261 --> 45:28.082
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why I made that thread.

45:28.142 --> 45:29.002
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, good segue, good segue.

45:29.042 --> 45:36.125
[SPEAKER_01]: If you go onto our forums at orangeloungeradio.com, there is a link under console gaming.

45:37.325 --> 45:39.326
[SPEAKER_01]: I posted my friend code for Animal Crossing.

45:40.727 --> 45:43.608
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't checked it lately, but we need to get more people on there.

45:43.976 --> 45:46.076
[SPEAKER_05]: When I go back to Animal Crossing, I'll post my friend code.

45:46.236 --> 45:47.697
[SPEAKER_05]: But for right now, I'm not fancy for it.

45:47.717 --> 45:49.317
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can come visit me in Danville.

45:49.797 --> 45:50.777
[SPEAKER_01]: Not Danville, Hades.

45:50.857 --> 45:51.637
[SPEAKER_01]: Dan with Danville.

45:51.798 --> 45:53.078
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll post my husband's too.

45:53.398 --> 45:54.918
[SPEAKER_05]: And Loki has OLR Town, right?

45:55.118 --> 45:56.858
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

45:57.079 --> 45:59.319
[SPEAKER_05]: You guys are doing Animal Crossing spam or something?

46:00.099 --> 46:01.999
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, we're doing Animal Crossing spam.

46:02.100 --> 46:02.720
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, that's great.

46:02.880 --> 46:06.140
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, I'm going to open up a contest.

46:06.880 --> 46:07.841
[SPEAKER_01]: A little tiny contest.

46:08.481 --> 46:09.581
[SPEAKER_01]: If you get a bottle...

46:11.070 --> 46:21.120
[SPEAKER_01]: If from the ocean a message in a bottle that has Orange Lounge Radio written by me or Loki or Rob, then we'll send you a box of cookies.

46:22.001 --> 46:23.623
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, you're buying those cookies and shipping them then?

46:23.643 --> 46:24.564
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll buy the cookies and ship them.

46:24.584 --> 46:24.964
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, good.

46:26.045 --> 46:27.927
[SPEAKER_01]: They may be moldy by the time you get them, but I'll do it.

46:29.949 --> 46:30.750
[SPEAKER_05]: Anything else in the mail box?

46:30.870 --> 46:34.414
[SPEAKER_01]: If you live in another country, I'll send you cookies that you can only get here.

46:35.523 --> 46:36.263
[SPEAKER_05]: Girl Scout Cookies.

46:36.343 --> 46:36.643
[SPEAKER_05]: Delicious.

46:36.663 --> 46:37.404
[SPEAKER_01]: Girl Scout Cookies.

46:37.484 --> 46:37.744
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright.

46:38.224 --> 46:39.024
[SPEAKER_05]: Moving on.

46:39.204 --> 46:43.846
[SPEAKER_01]: What else?

46:43.866 --> 46:50.208
[SPEAKER_01]: We got a couple more listeners write in about the whole parental debate.

46:50.788 --> 46:53.089
[SPEAKER_01]: We actually got one person who didn't like our last episode.

46:53.849 --> 46:54.029
[SPEAKER_05]: Aww.

46:54.169 --> 46:55.790
[SPEAKER_01]: Because we talked about Animal Crossing too much.

46:56.070 --> 46:58.071
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, it's the game of the week.

46:58.091 --> 46:58.831
[SPEAKER_05]: What are you supposed to do?

46:59.451 --> 47:01.532
[SPEAKER_01]: Lots of people are playing Animal Crossing.

47:01.752 --> 47:02.312
[SPEAKER_05]: That's alright.

47:02.332 --> 47:02.952
[SPEAKER_05]: You're welcome to your pit.

47:02.972 --> 47:04.113
[SPEAKER_05]: We talk about other games too.

47:04.133 --> 47:04.513
[SPEAKER_01]: We try to

47:05.959 --> 47:09.181
[SPEAKER_05]: It just so happens that all three of us enjoy Animal Crossing, so it's going to come up.

47:09.241 --> 47:09.862
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, whatever.

47:09.882 --> 47:10.622
[SPEAKER_05]: That's fine.

47:10.642 --> 47:15.405
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, we got a few thank yous from some of the parents for reading the articles.

47:15.465 --> 47:23.471
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, the one that I was very impressed with, Sloan that wrote us, that was a very, very good letter.

47:23.511 --> 47:32.877
[SPEAKER_01]: And he wrote back just to say that, you know, he actually, you know, felt he was good to hear, you know, us read the letter.

47:33.538 --> 47:33.818
[SPEAKER_01]: Also...

47:34.807 --> 47:35.548
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for watching!

47:54.031 --> 47:57.534
[SPEAKER_01]: But he gave us the okay to post that letter on the site.

47:57.674 --> 47:57.894
[SPEAKER_05]: Great.

47:58.174 --> 48:00.456
[SPEAKER_01]: So I will be doing that shortly within the week.

48:00.816 --> 48:01.036
[SPEAKER_00]: Great.

48:01.517 --> 48:03.198
[SPEAKER_01]: I've just been busy with finals.

48:03.218 --> 48:03.778
[SPEAKER_00]: That's fine.

48:04.679 --> 48:05.520
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

48:07.161 --> 48:13.786
[SPEAKER_01]: And someone actually sent us an email as a Mac man.

48:15.367 --> 48:21.612
[SPEAKER_01]: So in response to playing copyrighted music on a podcast, as Gunn says, there isn't a crime if there isn't a law.

48:23.851 --> 48:24.271
[SPEAKER_05]: Hint, hint.

48:44.216 --> 48:53.319
[SPEAKER_01]: The last one is an article sent to us by our friend Sasuke.

48:54.459 --> 49:02.322
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, I actually mentioned him in that other article I read via ex-Army Ranger and West Point psychology professor Grossman.

49:03.849 --> 49:05.210
[SPEAKER_01]: Lieutenant Colonel Dave Grossman.

49:05.570 --> 49:17.096
[SPEAKER_01]: Apparently he's been all in demand by law enforcement agencies talking about video game violence when, you know, there's proof that we don't have the situation.

49:17.676 --> 49:19.377
[SPEAKER_05]: Was this this other article you were going to talk about here?

49:19.457 --> 49:20.938
[SPEAKER_05]: You want to... Oh, okay, cool.

49:21.098 --> 49:22.739
[SPEAKER_01]: I was moving into it.

49:22.759 --> 49:23.319
[SPEAKER_05]: Just making sure.

49:23.639 --> 49:28.261
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I was trying to be all smooth and ninja-like with my recording skills.

49:28.281 --> 49:28.562
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sorry.

49:28.582 --> 49:30.022
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm scatterbrained tonight.

49:31.243 --> 49:33.304
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't get my mind off Actraiser and how beautiful it is.

49:34.181 --> 49:35.101
[SPEAKER_01]: We need a new Actriser.

49:35.541 --> 49:36.642
[SPEAKER_05]: I just, I said that.

49:36.862 --> 49:37.362
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, see?

49:38.242 --> 49:38.882
[SPEAKER_05]: Bad transition.

49:38.942 --> 49:39.182
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway.

49:39.762 --> 49:42.723
[SPEAKER_01]: And anyway, he says that first person shooters are murder simulators.

49:46.164 --> 49:46.604
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what?

49:46.644 --> 49:47.904
[SPEAKER_05]: Didn't Jack Thompson say that?

49:48.185 --> 49:48.805
[SPEAKER_01]: I know.

49:49.125 --> 49:49.465
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

49:49.525 --> 49:51.145
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't want to misquote somebody.

49:51.565 --> 49:52.946
[SPEAKER_01]: They're all screwing each other.

49:53.566 --> 49:53.886
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway.

49:56.903 --> 50:03.446
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, it's just, and really, it's more of the same bullshit we've had spewed out of many, many people's mouths.

50:04.186 --> 50:06.767
[SPEAKER_01]: And my thought on all of this is, please shut up.

50:07.988 --> 50:10.209
[SPEAKER_01]: Y'all don't know what you're talking about.

50:10.349 --> 50:13.350
[SPEAKER_01]: It makes you sound like a big, stupid butthead.

50:13.450 --> 50:20.953
[SPEAKER_05]: All this hot coffee, seriously, if hot coffee really bothered you in 2005, it's time to switch to decaf in 2006.

50:20.993 --> 50:21.333
[SPEAKER_05]: Iced latte.

50:23.789 --> 50:24.329
[SPEAKER_05]: No decaf.

50:24.909 --> 50:25.530
[SPEAKER_05]: Or tea.

50:25.990 --> 50:26.930
[SPEAKER_01]: Go to tea.

50:27.070 --> 50:28.211
[SPEAKER_05]: Do some chai tea.

50:28.671 --> 50:28.991
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki.

50:29.291 --> 50:29.631
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, I'm sorry.

50:29.651 --> 50:30.411
[SPEAKER_05]: Anything else in the mailbag?

50:31.252 --> 50:31.872
[SPEAKER_01]: No.

50:32.972 --> 50:33.693
[SPEAKER_01]: Lots of links from up.

50:33.853 --> 50:38.575
[SPEAKER_05]: To go at OrangeLoungeRadio.com and email us and love us.

50:38.955 --> 50:39.275
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki.

50:39.295 --> 50:40.595
[SPEAKER_04]: A couple things.

50:41.256 --> 50:46.217
[SPEAKER_04]: First, being that we're getting into a new year, what is one of the things you must do?

50:46.598 --> 50:47.618
[SPEAKER_04]: Get a new calendar.

50:49.161 --> 50:51.721
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, PSPMagazines.com has you covered.

50:51.741 --> 50:53.122
[SPEAKER_05]: But I don't want a new calendar.

50:53.282 --> 50:55.522
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, you can have a sexy new calendar.

50:55.642 --> 50:56.262
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, never mind.

50:56.302 --> 51:01.723
[SPEAKER_04]: From ForHim Magazine or other sites.

51:01.843 --> 51:08.304
[SPEAKER_04]: They also have a calendar from ForHim Magazine, the 2006 PSP calendar featuring sexy babes.

51:08.364 --> 51:09.664
[SPEAKER_05]: A PSP calendar.

51:10.265 --> 51:12.925
[SPEAKER_04]: And the Maxim 2006 calendar.

51:13.305 --> 51:15.806
[SPEAKER_04]: These are actually four-year backdrops.

51:16.306 --> 51:18.486
[SPEAKER_04]: You can add them into your themes and stuff.

51:20.049 --> 51:20.830
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura

51:46.386 --> 52:00.169
[SPEAKER_04]: On Monday the 19th, Nintendo of America's Executive Vice President of Sales and Marketing, Reggie Fils Ami, at 4 o'clock to 5.30 Pacific Time, you can actually get a chance to play him at Mario Kart DS.

52:09.803 --> 52:12.847
[SPEAKER_04]: If you get lucky and at 4 p.m.

52:12.927 --> 52:22.636
[SPEAKER_04]: Pacific Time start hammering the worldwide mode on your Wi-Fi and you might get lucky to go against NOA Reggie.

52:24.418 --> 52:25.599
[SPEAKER_04]: So, yeah.

52:26.140 --> 52:28.702
[SPEAKER_05]: How many fake NOA Reggies are going to be logged in though, I wonder?

52:29.973 --> 52:31.113
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe they don't let you, I don't know.

52:31.193 --> 52:31.853
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think they let you.

52:31.893 --> 52:39.815
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyways, although if you happen to live near Bellevue, Washington, he will be at the Bellevue Square McDonald's at that time.

52:39.855 --> 52:42.675
[SPEAKER_04]: You can actually meet him there and get some Nintendo swag as well.

52:43.935 --> 52:47.856
[SPEAKER_05]: Which just goes to show, executives dine on McDonald's once in a while too.

52:47.916 --> 52:53.777
[SPEAKER_05]: They have to get down and dirty with the rest of us and get their 99 cent menus and stuff.

52:54.017 --> 52:58.998
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly, so I think that's pretty cool that they're doing that kind of stuff, so

53:00.461 --> 53:01.201
[SPEAKER_04]: Good luck, people.

53:01.601 --> 53:04.623
[SPEAKER_04]: I know a lot of the Snakers out there would like to go up against him.

53:05.703 --> 53:07.143
[SPEAKER_05]: Expose all the bugs in the game, please.

53:07.163 --> 53:11.585
[SPEAKER_04]: Apparently, this guy is really good at Mario Kart, so it should be interesting.

53:11.785 --> 53:12.145
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll see.

53:13.186 --> 53:14.226
[SPEAKER_05]: I know you had one other quick thing.

53:14.246 --> 53:15.487
[SPEAKER_05]: I want you to make sure you get all the stories out.

53:15.667 --> 53:18.628
[SPEAKER_05]: The thing about the Game Boy, the old-ass Game Boy?

53:18.668 --> 53:21.829
[SPEAKER_04]: That's all speculation and rumors, so I'm not going to really go into it.

53:22.309 --> 53:27.431
[SPEAKER_04]: Basically, the whole story was about the system that they're saying is going to be called Game Boy Evolution.

53:27.970 --> 53:33.234
[SPEAKER_04]: and how it's supposed to come out later and it's supposed to rival the PSP, yada yada yada.

53:33.274 --> 53:40.040
[SPEAKER_04]: This is stuff that's been in development since 2004 and since there's no actual firm information on it, it's all speculation.

53:40.100 --> 53:41.061
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not even going to cover it.

53:42.461 --> 53:42.942
[SPEAKER_05]: Interesting.

53:44.223 --> 53:55.914
[SPEAKER_05]: I have a story here that talks about the biggest blockbusters of 2005 and it kind of coordinates with another story that you've probably seen around the internet talking about video game sales have fallen 18% this year.

53:55.954 --> 53:59.398
[SPEAKER_05]: And of course they're blaming that on no big blockbuster titles this year.

53:59.418 --> 54:00.819
[SPEAKER_05]: We did not have a Halo 2 this year.

54:00.839 --> 54:03.241
[SPEAKER_05]: We did not have a Grand Theft Auto San Andreas this year.

54:03.522 --> 54:04.823
[SPEAKER_05]: So they're saying that because of this,

54:05.444 --> 54:13.451
[SPEAKER_05]: Even with the Xbox 360, well, heck, not everybody who wanted to buy an Xbox 360 could get one, so video game sales on the whole have fallen a little bit.

54:13.732 --> 54:18.837
[SPEAKER_05]: This kind of doesn't surprise me, though, honestly, because we're sitting on the cusp of the next gaming generation.

54:19.297 --> 54:21.580
[SPEAKER_05]: This should be natural for the game sales to fall, right?

54:21.660 --> 54:26.825
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know why this is such a shock, but what's interesting, I thought what's interesting, the top...

54:28.002 --> 54:31.224
[SPEAKER_05]: The top ten selling games of 2005 through November.

54:31.705 --> 54:34.446
[SPEAKER_05]: Only three of them actually released in 2005.

54:35.547 --> 54:43.192
[SPEAKER_05]: Madden, Madden Football, Gran Turismo 4, Pokemon Emerald were the only games released in 2005 to make the top ten list.

54:43.733 --> 54:50.897
[SPEAKER_05]: And hell, even Halo, released in 2001 on the original Xbox thanks to price cuts and things, number nine on the list.

54:52.158 --> 54:52.698
[SPEAKER_05]: Crazy, huh?

54:52.899 --> 54:54.880
[SPEAKER_05]: They're saying also part of the reason this is, you know...

54:56.065 --> 54:57.586
[SPEAKER_05]: The sales figures are not what they should be.

54:58.147 --> 55:01.490
[SPEAKER_05]: Most of the hugely anticipated games for 2005 bumped to 2006.

55:02.831 --> 55:07.616
[SPEAKER_05]: Kingdom Hearts 2, Final Fantasy XII, Zelda, Twilight Princess.

55:08.377 --> 55:10.199
[SPEAKER_05]: Everything got bumped, so what's left?

55:10.639 --> 55:16.225
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly, and the other thing that's interesting to note is on the Xbox 360, they're live.

55:16.245 --> 55:18.187
[SPEAKER_04]: The number one game on there, Halo 2.

55:20.327 --> 55:20.747
[SPEAKER_05]: Interesting.

55:22.168 --> 55:29.473
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, now we're going to end tonight's show, but we're going to talk about some sexy things to end tonight's show, some sexy things for your Christmas season.

55:29.714 --> 55:31.775
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, you got a sexy MMO?

55:32.896 --> 55:35.818
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a porn company called Naughty America.

55:36.308 --> 55:37.329
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen

56:04.230 --> 56:10.460
[SPEAKER_01]: You can also though change your appearance by going to clothing stores, hair salons, tattoo parlor, plastic surgeon.

56:11.301 --> 56:15.267
[SPEAKER_05]: Didn't Yahoo Messenger just roll out the avatar thing where you can do the hair salon and everything?

56:15.888 --> 56:17.531
[SPEAKER_05]: There's some interesting correlations here.

56:18.703 --> 56:20.524
[SPEAKER_01]: But you've got different areas.

56:20.584 --> 56:24.507
[SPEAKER_01]: You have like downtown with your sex shops and video games.

56:24.527 --> 56:26.268
[SPEAKER_04]: Does Yahoo Messenger have the sex shops?

56:26.448 --> 56:27.308
[SPEAKER_04]: No, it doesn't.

56:27.408 --> 56:33.772
[SPEAKER_01]: Uptown, you've got outdoor cafes, casino, beach has boardwalks, swimming, poolside bars, goose trips.

56:34.012 --> 56:36.134
[SPEAKER_05]: Wasn't this just what Sims Online turned into?

56:36.154 --> 56:37.434
[SPEAKER_05]: I have no idea.

56:37.474 --> 56:41.337
[SPEAKER_05]: I heard some story a while back that Sims Online, because remember the Sims Online was supposed to be this huge thing.

56:41.597 --> 56:45.639
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, just like the real world, the Sims Online got corrupted by porn and casino and all that stuff.

56:45.699 --> 56:46.520
[SPEAKER_05]: And now it's just like,

56:47.819 --> 56:49.981
[SPEAKER_01]: But this one actually has sex mode.

56:51.262 --> 56:51.462
[SPEAKER_01]: Really?

56:51.482 --> 56:57.588
[SPEAKER_01]: Where you can invite another player on a date and engage in interpersonal activity.

56:57.608 --> 56:58.589
[SPEAKER_01]: Some hot coffee.

56:59.870 --> 57:01.291
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you invite them over for some hot coffee?

57:01.411 --> 57:06.496
[SPEAKER_01]: Wasn't there a game that we saw over by the folks that did Xtango?

57:06.576 --> 57:09.158
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, um... Feel 3.

57:09.318 --> 57:11.320
[SPEAKER_05]: Feel 3, thank you, that's a game.

57:11.360 --> 57:13.562
[SPEAKER_01]: Where you actually broke the demo and had them...

57:14.306 --> 57:17.547
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, you actually got... Loki did so good on the demo.

57:17.587 --> 57:22.888
[SPEAKER_05]: Somebody actually had to come by and put their hand up on the monitor because this person was starting to show too much.

57:23.868 --> 57:24.948
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I got a picture of that.

57:24.968 --> 57:26.549
[SPEAKER_01]: It should be up on our E3 picks.

57:26.629 --> 57:27.809
[SPEAKER_05]: I know, it's somewhere in the gallery.

57:27.969 --> 57:29.149
[SPEAKER_01]: No, no, no, no, no!

57:29.169 --> 57:30.750
No, no, no, no, no!

57:31.190 --> 57:32.250
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it was the last day.

57:33.490 --> 57:34.131
[SPEAKER_05]: I remember that.

57:34.211 --> 57:37.471
[SPEAKER_04]: I should have taken that as my cue to start clicking like hell.

57:39.412 --> 57:40.272
[SPEAKER_01]: That was hilarious.

57:42.547 --> 57:45.149
[SPEAKER_05]: Didn't one of us ask them if there would be dude-on-dude action?

57:45.809 --> 57:45.969
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

57:46.349 --> 57:47.850
[SPEAKER_05]: I think you or me asked about that.

57:47.970 --> 57:49.191
[SPEAKER_01]: One man played woman.

57:50.151 --> 57:52.712
[SPEAKER_05]: We asked about that, like, could the game go there?

57:52.953 --> 57:53.833
[SPEAKER_05]: And they told us no.

57:54.853 --> 57:57.195
[SPEAKER_05]: They didn't understand, I don't think, what we were asking.

57:57.835 --> 57:59.416
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you be gay in this game?

58:00.236 --> 58:01.057
[SPEAKER_05]: Can you be cowboys?

58:01.177 --> 58:02.797
[SPEAKER_05]: Can you both dress up as cowboys?

58:02.877 --> 58:04.138
[SPEAKER_01]: He said, boy play woman.

58:04.898 --> 58:05.239
[SPEAKER_05]: Single.

58:05.279 --> 58:06.719
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what he said.

58:06.819 --> 58:08.000
[SPEAKER_05]: I remember that now, that's right now.

58:10.197 --> 58:12.559
[SPEAKER_01]: I delegate my assignment to Loki.

58:12.579 --> 58:19.383
[SPEAKER_01]: The only thing that this does not have that Feel 3 does is USB accessories to go with it

58:40.259 --> 58:43.481
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, Feel 3 had attachments.

58:44.001 --> 58:45.002
[SPEAKER_05]: Like the Rez vibrator?

58:45.022 --> 58:46.222
[SPEAKER_05]: The trance vibrator?

58:46.302 --> 58:48.464
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, but this thing wasn't a trance.

58:48.704 --> 58:50.645
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm still looking for one of those, by the way.

58:51.085 --> 58:52.206
[SPEAKER_01]: I finally found a copy of Rez.

58:52.226 --> 58:52.946
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, TMI, honey.

58:53.547 --> 58:54.607
[SPEAKER_01]: No, no, no, no, no, no.

58:55.848 --> 58:58.449
[SPEAKER_01]: Just to see if it's really as awful as they say it is.

58:58.489 --> 59:00.610
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm not going to use it for that, you perv.

59:02.792 --> 59:03.752
[SPEAKER_05]: I have a sexy story.

59:04.513 --> 59:06.174
[SPEAKER_05]: Actually, I don't know if this is sexy or not.

59:07.594 --> 59:08.395
[SPEAKER_05]: Craigslist...

59:08.973 --> 59:10.433
[SPEAKER_05]: which should say it all right there.

59:10.473 --> 59:14.595
[SPEAKER_05]: If you want to see some real nasty stuff, Craigslist is the place for you to be.

59:14.635 --> 59:15.975
[SPEAKER_05]: Just check out some of the personals on there.

59:16.015 --> 59:17.235
[SPEAKER_05]: Not that I know firsthand or anything.

59:17.575 --> 59:22.217
[SPEAKER_05]: However, there were some posts on Craigslist in the Boston area.

59:22.777 --> 59:26.118
[SPEAKER_05]: There was a young woman there that was willing to trade sex.

59:26.880 --> 59:28.481
[SPEAKER_05]: for an Xbox 360.

59:28.561 --> 59:33.645
[SPEAKER_05]: She also was describing a female, talking about a little menage a trois action.

59:33.665 --> 59:36.747
[SPEAKER_05]: If you don't know what I mean by that, ask your parents.

59:37.527 --> 59:37.887
[SPEAKER_05]: No, don't.

59:39.969 --> 59:42.330
[SPEAKER_05]: It has to be a premium bundle.

59:42.410 --> 59:47.954
[SPEAKER_05]: These guys only want premium bundles for their sexual encounter.

59:49.545 --> 59:52.427
[SPEAKER_05]: However, the post was removed, just so you guys know.

59:52.447 --> 59:57.049
[SPEAKER_05]: The post was removed from Craigslist, but not before millions of nerds on the internet had a good laugh at it.

59:58.150 --> 59:59.871
[SPEAKER_04]: The post was removed because she was a sea donkey.

01:00:04.874 --> 01:00:12.338
[SPEAKER_05]: And apparently some gaming journalists actually tried to write the person an email to see if this person was serious, and maybe that's why it got removed.

01:00:12.458 --> 01:00:13.139
[SPEAKER_05]: I have no idea.

01:00:13.799 --> 01:00:14.359
[SPEAKER_05]: But anyway...

01:00:16.866 --> 01:00:20.927
[SPEAKER_05]: Some people are willing to go to great lengths to get that Xbox 360 before Christmas.

01:00:21.007 --> 01:00:23.508
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, you're pointing at something and going, oh my god, oh my god.

01:00:24.569 --> 01:00:28.830
[SPEAKER_01]: As I typically do, check VGCats, which is one of my favorite webcomics.

01:00:29.550 --> 01:00:32.011
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all Animal Crossing and everybody needs to look at today's.

01:00:32.871 --> 01:00:35.312
[SPEAKER_05]: You talk about Animal Crossing too much on this show, DarkSakura.

01:00:36.012 --> 01:00:36.473
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh no!

01:00:36.793 --> 01:00:37.913
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm taking that game away from you.

01:00:38.013 --> 01:00:38.333
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright.

01:00:38.553 --> 01:00:39.094
[SPEAKER_05]: No!

01:00:39.474 --> 01:00:40.314
[SPEAKER_05]: We gotta wrap up.

01:00:40.354 --> 01:00:40.934
[SPEAKER_05]: We gotta wrap up.

01:00:42.255 --> 01:00:44.795
[SPEAKER_05]: We gotta go around and get everybody's final thoughts so we can call it a night.

01:00:44.875 --> 01:00:46.396
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki, your final thought.

01:00:47.347 --> 01:00:47.788
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm tired.

01:00:48.690 --> 01:00:49.872
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, your final thought.

01:00:50.152 --> 01:00:52.336
[SPEAKER_01]: Reject false icons and get rid of the plague for me.

01:00:53.078 --> 01:00:55.021
[SPEAKER_05]: My final thought is Boy Play Woman.

01:00:55.742 --> 01:00:56.484
[SPEAKER_01]: Boy Play Woman!

01:00:57.737 --> 01:00:58.457
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll see you next week.

01:00:58.477 --> 01:00:59.998
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, we are going to do a show next week.

01:01:00.078 --> 01:01:09.724
[SPEAKER_05]: Even though it's Christmas, we're going to find some time to pre-record a show, maybe talk about some of the year's best, or at least our favorite for the year, and all sorts of other year-end things you would come to expect.

01:01:10.144 --> 01:01:13.526
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, as always, for giving a crap and listening to our show.

01:01:13.566 --> 01:01:16.848
[SPEAKER_05]: We really appreciate it, especially when we're indie and all that stuff.

01:01:17.209 --> 01:01:18.169
[SPEAKER_05]: We really appreciate it.

01:01:18.669 --> 01:01:22.532
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to give a shout-out real quick to our buddies over at GamePolitics.com.

01:01:23.192 --> 01:01:26.033
[SPEAKER_05]: because we kind of dropped the ball on something we said we were going to do for them.

01:01:26.193 --> 01:01:27.953
[SPEAKER_05]: We kind of weren't able to do it because of the plague.

01:01:28.693 --> 01:01:33.335
[SPEAKER_05]: So we want to say hi and sorry and go visit Game Politics because they're a great site.

01:01:33.395 --> 01:01:36.796
[SPEAKER_01]: Happy holidays, and we hope that your next year is drama-free.

01:01:36.976 --> 01:01:37.396
[SPEAKER_05]: That's right.

01:01:37.676 --> 01:01:37.976
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

01:01:39.236 --> 01:01:41.357
[SPEAKER_05]: Have a good one, and we'll see you next week.

01:01:41.557 --> 01:01:41.837
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay?

01:01:42.137 --> 01:01:42.397
[SPEAKER_05]: Bye-bye.

01:01:44.384 --> 01:01:47.948
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the end of another Orange Lounge Radio To Go edition.

01:01:48.268 --> 01:01:53.774
[SPEAKER_03]: This podcast is a proud part of www.orangeloungeradio.com.

01:01:54.215 --> 01:01:55.236
[SPEAKER_03]: See you next update.
