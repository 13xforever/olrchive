Your podcast host for all the latest video game news and gamer chat.

00:13.000 --> 00:18.000
Now, here are your hosts, DarkSakura, Skye, and Loki.

00:19.000 --> 00:23.000
Hello, everybody. Once again, welcome to Orange Lounge Radio To Go,

00:23.000 --> 00:28.000
that podcast dedicated to video games and gaming.

00:28.000 --> 00:31.440
We especially like to talk about games that don't suck but you know once in a

00:31.440 --> 00:34.200
while we got to bring up games that do suck because we have to tell you to

00:34.200 --> 00:38.080
avoid them like the plague and I'm happy to report that I have escaped the plague

00:38.080 --> 00:42.000
I'm not sick anymore I'm feeling a lot better than I was last week for our

00:42.000 --> 00:46.420
50th episode but over there Dark Sakura how you doing you still a little plaguey

00:46.420 --> 00:51.800
Dark Sakura? I'm still the carrier of the evil plague. Are you are you infected? I'm

00:51.800 --> 00:56.280
infected but I don't think that I have the t-virus anymore because I haven't

00:56.280 --> 01:00.660
started trying you know to eat my husband for dinner oh good that's good

01:00.660 --> 01:04.040
you know I haven't been sniffing his spicy brains yeah you've gone seven

01:04.040 --> 01:08.640
weeks without doing that huh yeah I've actually gone seven weeks without eating

01:08.640 --> 01:14.080
much of anything but hey leaves me more money to spend on games there you go

01:14.080 --> 01:19.520
Loki won't get to your games in a minute Loki um how you doing I'm still a bit

01:19.520 --> 01:29.140
congested, yes. But mostly plague-free, like 99.7% plague-free. Yes, 99.9% plague-free,

01:29.140 --> 01:37.400
but I did think I had the t-virus because I did eat my fiancé, so. You need to not

01:37.400 --> 01:43.520
bring that on the show. My name is Rob Roberts, also known as Skye, and I will be going back

01:43.520 --> 01:48.400
to a cleaner subject, such as, how was your gaming week? Dark soccer. And that's a clean

01:48.400 --> 01:52.840
subject huh yes dark Sakura lots of lots of animal cross oh I'm sorry I don't

01:52.840 --> 01:57.160
want to talk too much about Animal Crossing I know guess what I played

01:57.160 --> 02:05.120
Animal Crossing anything else not really because last week was finals mm-hmm

02:05.120 --> 02:11.080
however I did do something game related mm-hmm and I can post link to this on

02:11.080 --> 02:14.040
our forums which people should be visiting of course at Orange Jones

02:14.040 --> 02:21.500
radio.com but I did a game a slipcover and back cover for Silent Hill the movie

02:21.500 --> 02:25.260
the game the irony is that I was doing a game based off a movie based off the

02:25.260 --> 02:28.920
game is that like Street Fighter 2 the movie the game except it doesn't suck

02:28.920 --> 02:34.080
ass but this is not a real game let's just get that clear but our

02:34.080 --> 02:41.860
illustrator project was to either do a CD like music CD or game CD so I picked

02:41.860 --> 02:45.820
Silent Hill the movie the game. I'm telling you you need to do that poster project. You should take that

02:46.140 --> 02:50.760
Concept and make it like a poster or you know what hell with it. Just send that in as your poster

02:50.920 --> 02:55.060
See what happens. You never know what might happen. I'd have to do a whole lot more to it

02:55.060 --> 02:57.700
However, it did give me some ideas for the poster

02:57.700 --> 03:02.700
So perhaps I'll make a project of that get that done though, cuz you know, you know the deadlines fast approaching

03:02.700 --> 03:04.700
I know anything else you've been playing this one

03:07.360 --> 03:09.800
No Silent Hill 3 no sexy beam, you know

03:09.800 --> 03:15.960
I because all I did was work on my final projects for the first half of the week. Mm-hmm

03:15.960 --> 03:22.300
I honestly have not had time but however now that schools let out I do have more time to play games and actually

03:22.560 --> 03:26.480
Hunting down myself and health three strategy guide right now because I need the map for the level of in

03:26.800 --> 03:30.320
I'm in still in the hospital. I do have to ask an Animal Crossing question

03:30.320 --> 03:32.880
I don't want to go into Animal Crossing ad nauseam again this week

03:32.880 --> 03:38.360
But didn't you say there was a baby lost in your village and you you didn't you sell the baby to Tom Nook or something?

03:38.360 --> 03:42.360
I was trying to sell, I wanted to sell the baby to Crazy Red to sell on the black market,

03:42.360 --> 03:46.360
but he wasn't there, and so Loki rescued him and brought him back to his mommy.

03:46.360 --> 03:48.360
Aww, that's very nice. Good to hear.

03:48.360 --> 03:51.360
Yeah, but I did sell some furniture.

03:51.360 --> 03:54.360
Alright. Loki, how was your gaming week?

03:54.360 --> 04:00.360
My gaming week was diverse. I played some Animal Crossing as well.

04:00.360 --> 04:06.360
Actually, my fiancé's been taking that and playing it at work during her downtime.

04:06.360 --> 04:11.880
But, um, I've been playing the usual games, like Grand Theft Auto Liberty City Stories,

04:11.880 --> 04:15.520
and we've actually been, we've got another person in now, so we have five-player death

04:15.520 --> 04:18.120
matches every, um, twice a day.

04:18.120 --> 04:19.120
And that's really fun.

04:19.120 --> 04:20.440
I thought four was the most you could have.

04:20.440 --> 04:21.440
Six.

04:21.440 --> 04:22.440
Oh, nice.

04:22.440 --> 04:23.440
Six is the most.

04:23.440 --> 04:25.480
And we are, we're lining up our sixth person, so it's gonna be awesome.

04:25.480 --> 04:27.200
Um, so that's pretty cool.

04:27.200 --> 04:31.480
Um, and then during lunches I've been playing Call of Duty 2 death matches, so it's a whole

04:31.480 --> 04:34.280
day filled with death matches at my work.

04:34.280 --> 04:39.660
And that game's actually really cool. I'm very pleased with it. I haven't played much

04:39.660 --> 04:44.400
of Perfect Dark. Did play a little bit of Cameo. That was really cool. Still pretty

04:44.400 --> 04:49.280
easy. But overall, decent game for a launch, I guess.

04:49.280 --> 04:50.640
What does Cameo really like?

04:50.640 --> 04:51.640
It's a platform game. Definitely.

04:51.640 --> 04:57.400
What does that mean? Does it mean like a Crash Bandicoot type of game or what? Spyro type?

04:57.400 --> 04:58.400
That's kind of a question.

04:58.400 --> 05:05.880
Platforming basically a lot of jumping, figuring out puzzles, killing things, and not really

05:05.880 --> 05:10.960
much in the collecting stuff, but it's just kind of your normal, you know, like Mario

05:10.960 --> 05:13.120
64 minus all the, you know...

05:13.120 --> 05:14.120
Okay, I gotcha.

05:14.120 --> 05:15.120
Yeah.

05:15.120 --> 05:16.120
I gotcha.

05:16.120 --> 05:19.080
Actually, I did have one thing to add that's related to Loki's Week.

05:19.080 --> 05:20.080
What's that?

05:20.080 --> 05:21.080
It gave me Papa Locross.

05:21.080 --> 05:22.080
Ah, for the PSP.

05:22.080 --> 05:24.120
And I'm going to be playing the hell out of it.

05:24.120 --> 05:27.440
Alright, well then I expect a full review next week, young lady.

05:27.440 --> 05:31.400
Absolutely. Oh, ow. I sucked my thumb out and I popped my elbow.

05:31.400 --> 05:34.880
Oh, if only we were TV sometimes. Anyway, anything else, Loki?

05:34.880 --> 05:38.480
Um, other than that, no. I haven't played anything else.

05:38.480 --> 05:42.080
Um, I will not be talking about Animal Crossing this week in my gaming week because

05:42.080 --> 05:45.640
Animal Crossing got the boot for my DS. Actually, it didn't. It's still sitting there in the top

05:45.640 --> 05:47.760
slot, but it's sitting there completely unloved

05:47.760 --> 05:51.240
because a new game went into the bottom slot on my DS and that was

05:51.240 --> 05:54.840
Final Fantasy IV Advance I picked up earlier this week.

05:54.840 --> 05:58.000
I have not stopped playing it since I got it, and I

05:58.000 --> 06:01.320
I was amazed because here I am thinking

06:01.320 --> 06:05.240
how am I gonna get a lot of play out of this game that's 14 years old? I mean

06:05.240 --> 06:06.400
literally this game is like

06:06.400 --> 06:10.200
probably older than that, but in the US it's about 14 years old, so the last time I

06:10.200 --> 06:12.280
played through the game I would have been what, 13?

06:12.280 --> 06:15.880
Show my age there a little bit. I was 13 the first time I played through this game, and I really

06:15.880 --> 06:18.720
haven't played through it since. I touched on it a little bit when I was on

06:18.720 --> 06:19.840
PlayStation in the

06:19.840 --> 06:24.720
Final Fantasy Chronicles pack that came out, but I never really got super into it because

06:24.720 --> 06:27.380
I couldn't stay on the loading times before the battle, even though it wasn't that bad.

06:27.380 --> 06:29.720
It was bad enough.

06:29.720 --> 06:33.800
But now, since there are no loading times on this, it's so awesome.

06:33.800 --> 06:40.380
I'm rediscovering this classic, classic game, and Final Fantasy IV is a classic title.

06:40.380 --> 06:46.460
If you are into roleplaying games in any form, you must respect what this game did for future

06:46.460 --> 06:47.460
roleplaying games.

06:47.460 --> 06:51.660
must play a game if you did not play through it before. Now, I'm sure a lot of folks are

06:51.660 --> 06:55.740
thinking, well, what the hell makes this worth buying again if I already had this before?

06:55.740 --> 07:00.860
And the answer is that the script, which right there ought to sell this, because if you played

07:00.860 --> 07:07.180
Final Fantasy II on Super Nintendo with the original translation, the nice thing is they

07:07.180 --> 07:10.780
kept that line intact as a throwback to the fans. It's still You Spoonie Bard, because

07:10.780 --> 07:14.780
I've gotten through that part again. I've put in like five or six hours on that game.

07:14.780 --> 07:21.560
Diesel's already a paladin, I've played that game a lot, that's been my week pretty much.

07:21.560 --> 07:27.820
But they changed the script to put all the emotion and words and story really back into

07:27.820 --> 07:28.820
the game.

07:28.820 --> 07:33.460
It's kind of like before, you just had from point A to point B. You had the words that

07:33.460 --> 07:37.340
got you from point A to point B, but now it's really fleshed out and the story carries more

07:37.340 --> 07:38.340
emotion.

07:38.340 --> 07:43.620
And it's amazing when you consider this 2D game is emotional, but it's great.

07:43.620 --> 07:44.980
I can't say enough things about it.

07:44.980 --> 07:49.400
They put all the original moves back into it,

07:49.400 --> 07:52.280
so a lot of folks, like, you know when you go

07:52.280 --> 07:54.780
and you become a paladin for the first time,

07:54.780 --> 07:56.380
you have to fight yourself as a dark knight,

07:56.380 --> 07:58.340
but when you first played it on the Super Nintendo,

07:58.340 --> 07:59.620
the dark knight did a move,

07:59.620 --> 08:01.200
like you did this wavy beam move,

08:01.200 --> 08:02.520
and you're like, what the hell?

08:02.520 --> 08:04.000
How come I couldn't do that before?

08:04.000 --> 08:05.380
Well now, you can.

08:05.380 --> 08:06.620
They put that move back in,

08:06.620 --> 08:08.120
because that was in the original Japanese game,

08:08.120 --> 08:09.120
you can do that again.

08:09.120 --> 08:11.860
So it's great, because they put all these old moves back in,

08:11.860 --> 08:14.160
And the game is 14 years old.

08:14.160 --> 08:17.000
You probably haven't touched this game in a long time.

08:17.000 --> 08:18.820
Maybe you have through the use of emulators,

08:18.820 --> 08:21.480
but I'm betting 95% of the people that listen to this show

08:21.480 --> 08:22.320
and play Final Fantasy II

08:22.320 --> 08:24.240
haven't touched it in the 14 years since.

08:24.240 --> 08:26.400
Now's the time to go back and rediscover it.

08:26.400 --> 08:28.020
And I know a lot of people are saying,

08:28.020 --> 08:30.000
why the hell didn't they do this sooner?

08:30.000 --> 08:31.780
Why didn't they put this on the Game Boy Advance

08:31.780 --> 08:32.920
when the advance was first out?

08:32.920 --> 08:34.440
I don't know, they probably should have.

08:34.440 --> 08:36.020
But when you think about it,

08:36.020 --> 08:37.520
the fact that it's been 14 years

08:37.520 --> 08:39.520
since the original Final Fantasy IV,

08:39.520 --> 08:40.760
it was called Final Fantasy II here,

08:40.760 --> 08:50.160
This really is the chance for a whole new generation to discover Final Fantasy IV and

08:50.160 --> 08:51.920
the awesome game that it is.

08:51.920 --> 08:52.920
And now is the chance.

08:52.920 --> 08:54.560
And I say seize that opportunity.

08:54.560 --> 08:56.800
I give this game my highest recommendation.

08:56.800 --> 09:01.480
It is a must-play game if you are into role-playing games in any capacity.

09:01.480 --> 09:03.320
Even if you aren't, you need to give this one a try.

09:03.320 --> 09:06.840
Besides, even if you're thinking about it, what else is there to buy that's coming out

09:06.840 --> 09:07.840
this month?

09:07.840 --> 09:08.840
Gauntlet?

09:08.840 --> 09:12.920
I played Gauntlet at E3, it looks okay,

09:12.920 --> 09:16.200
but you know what? I don't care about anything else until I beat Final Fantasy 4.

09:16.200 --> 09:18.280
And you know what? For the next two weeks, you're probably gonna hear me saying this.

09:18.280 --> 09:19.440
All I played was Final Fantasy 4.

09:19.440 --> 09:22.520
Sorry, I have to do this. This is my childhood coming back.

09:22.520 --> 09:25.640
To ask you, do you know if it's a port

09:25.640 --> 09:29.440
of the WonderSwan version? I don't know,

09:29.440 --> 09:33.200
because I don't know enough about the WonderSwan version. I can tell you that it is not

09:33.200 --> 09:36.480
Easy Type. It is the original Japanese because

09:36.480 --> 09:42.700
You can... I'm sorry, you don't have a heal potion, you have like the gold needle, the

09:42.700 --> 09:43.440
Maiden's Kiss.

09:43.440 --> 09:46.800
Everything is split up like that. Palimporum, you will be able to bring back.

09:46.800 --> 09:48.700
That's the other big catch about this game is that

09:48.700 --> 09:52.180
you can switch your characters now. Later in the game, any character that

09:52.180 --> 09:54.720
disappeared you couldn't use in the final zero miss battle,

09:54.720 --> 09:58.980
Edward, Palimporum, Yang, you get to bring them all back. They'll be in Mesidia, waiting

09:58.980 --> 10:00.220
for you to switch out.

10:00.220 --> 10:03.300
And apparently there's two new dungeons as well. I haven't even gotten to that point yet,

10:03.300 --> 10:04.220
so I'm just, I'm giddy

10:04.220 --> 10:08.340
about getting to that point. That's pretty cool. Well, um, is, I remember, um,

10:08.340 --> 10:12.100
because you remember when I was back in my, my WonderSwan everything phase? Oh, yeah.

10:12.100 --> 10:15.580
Oh, yeah. WonderSwan was, I, I don't know why they never tried that here, but, well,

10:15.580 --> 10:17.420
maybe because Nintendo's so dominating, I don't know.

10:17.420 --> 10:21.540
Well, I, I picked up the Final Fantasy, the first one, the WonderSwan package.

10:21.540 --> 10:25.100
Let's back up a minute, because I'm betting that probably a good portion of our

10:25.100 --> 10:27.860
listeners don't even know what the hell a WonderSwan is. What is a WonderSwan?

10:27.860 --> 10:30.980
It was, um, Bondai's handheld system.

10:30.980 --> 10:38.980
In fact, just to point out something, if anyone's ever seen the Street Fighter OAV anime, the one with Sakura and everything, at the end of it, she's playing Street Fighter on a regular Wonderswan.

10:38.980 --> 10:40.980
So, there's a point of reference.

10:40.980 --> 10:43.980
But it was not released here, in the US. It was only in Japan.

10:43.980 --> 10:51.980
Right, and when Dan and I found out that we were releasing the first Final Fantasy with a special limited edition Wonderswan, we was like, okay, that's ours.

10:51.980 --> 10:54.980
I thought the Wonderswan one came out over here, like, very limited.

10:54.980 --> 10:56.980
No, that was Neo Geo Pocket Color that we got.

10:56.980 --> 10:57.620
that we got.

10:57.620 --> 11:01.420
No, there was something else. Maybe it was Tiger Electronics thing. They had like a

11:01.420 --> 11:02.600
portable system, I thought.

11:02.600 --> 11:06.020
Regardless, even if it did come out in some limited capacity, I'm betting half our listeners

11:06.020 --> 11:07.220
don't even know of its existence.

11:07.220 --> 11:11.240
Like, the good Digimon games were on WonderSwan. There was, uh,

11:11.240 --> 11:14.260
actually, uh, Rockman and Bass were on, uh,

11:14.260 --> 11:17.460
the old WonderSwan. And there's a WonderSwan crystal out now.

11:17.460 --> 11:20.700
So, in fact, Final Fantasy I and II on Game Boy Advance

11:20.700 --> 11:23.820
are pretty much just the WonderSwan versions with some minor tweaks.

11:23.820 --> 11:28.260
2 and 4 came out on Wonders 1. They did not bring up 3, which pissed me off so much, because

11:28.260 --> 11:33.260
that was the one I wanted. It was the first one with the job change system, which is what

11:33.260 --> 11:36.020
I love about 5. That's the one that they're going back and tweaking really bad for the

11:36.020 --> 11:41.460
DS. And rumor is that if Final Fantasy 4 Advance sells well, which I think it will, 5 and 6

11:41.460 --> 11:44.620
are pretty much a given. In fact, I thought I read somewhere they're already working on

11:44.620 --> 11:50.700
6, so we'll see. We went back and played 5 on PS2, although I had already been playing

11:50.700 --> 11:54.540
emulated version and I had actually been playing it in Japanese for a little while too, but

11:55.620 --> 11:57.620
the good thing about

11:57.980 --> 12:02.140
The first one on WonderSwan is that because most of it was in Hiragana

12:02.140 --> 12:06.680
I could sort of read what was going on. I could at least read the spells and I could read the materials

12:06.680 --> 12:08.460
Which was easy enough

12:08.460 --> 12:12.020
But it was so pretty and the music was so good

12:12.020 --> 12:17.700
They had completely redone it that I'm and I know that 4 was given the same treatment. I'm wondering

12:17.700 --> 12:29.700
They went back and did some of the graphics, some of the sprites are cleaned up a little bit, but the music, I don't notice that much of a change.

12:29.700 --> 12:36.700
It is different, but only slight in some of the instrumentation. To me, I don't notice the difference, but somebody very picky will notice it.

12:36.700 --> 12:44.700
Well, also there's the difference between the MIDI synthesizers on the NES and what we got that have to have done it closer to the original.

12:44.700 --> 12:48.700
Well, when you're talking about NES vs. Advance, yes, but Super Nintendo vs.

12:48.700 --> 12:50.700
I'm talking about the Famicon vs. NES.

12:50.700 --> 12:51.700
Oh, oh, yeah, yeah.

12:51.700 --> 12:54.700
The instrumentation could have very likely been different on the Japanese one.

12:54.700 --> 12:55.700
Absolutely, absolutely.

12:55.700 --> 12:57.700
Ooh, that's a lot of Final Fantasy geekery.

12:57.700 --> 12:59.700
We better move on to other topics.

12:59.700 --> 13:00.700
Yeah.

13:00.700 --> 13:01.700
That's alright. Anyway, that was fun though.

13:01.700 --> 13:05.700
We haven't talked about the Wonder Swan yet in like 50 episodes of Orange Lounge, so.

13:05.700 --> 13:06.700
I'll bring it one day.

13:06.700 --> 13:07.700
Alright, sounds, ooh, we should.

13:07.700 --> 13:09.700
Sometimes I wish we were a TV show.

13:09.700 --> 13:12.700
We gotta look into doing that someday, anyway.

13:12.700 --> 13:18.380
Let's get into some news and dark soccer you had a whole crap load of news tonight. So, um, let's start it off

13:18.380 --> 13:20.380
I'm gonna let you talk about this

13:20.420 --> 13:26.020
Why don't you talk about some news about Sega Sega's gonna be doing some because we've been talking about handhelds

13:26.020 --> 13:29.740
He says Sega's got some stuff in store for handheld. I love Sega. I know you do

13:32.180 --> 13:36.240
Sega is actually coming out with two games for the handheld systems

13:36.580 --> 13:41.720
There's a one on PSP one on the GBA and the PSP title doesn't have a name yet

13:41.720 --> 13:48.520
But it's being done by totally games. That's the studio that did a x-wing vs. Tie fighter secret weapons over Normandy

13:49.520 --> 13:51.520
yay, um

13:51.880 --> 13:53.880
There's also

13:54.120 --> 13:56.560
They're saying though that it's a classic

13:57.440 --> 14:00.440
Game that they're trying to bring back. I'm wondering

14:01.400 --> 14:05.880
Exactly, which one that's gonna be but there's been nothing really official listed as the title

14:06.520 --> 14:10.340
To the Sega gods if you happen to be listening echo the dolphin, please

14:10.340 --> 14:12.620
I don't know. I don't know why that comes to my mind

14:12.620 --> 14:17.360
I just I would like to see that the last time we got was on Dreamcast and it was kind of it was kind of

14:17.360 --> 14:22.900
Poop, not really poop. I actually didn't get to play much of it, but it was I never really saw it

14:22.900 --> 14:28.040
I I heard that it got sort of a results. How about toe jam and Earl? That'd be kind of cool, too

14:28.040 --> 14:29.780
Please oh come on

14:29.780 --> 14:32.980
Did they did a toe jam in Earl too, but it was it was poopy wasn't it?

14:32.980 --> 14:37.900
But the first one man, we need to vector man back. All right. Anyway, no the other one

14:37.900 --> 14:44.780
Oh, actually there is a little bit more on this the game was described as a run-and-gun blast-a-thon quote

14:45.380 --> 14:48.620
It actually makes references to Robotron and Smash TV

14:50.020 --> 14:53.040
More money more prizes. I love it

14:54.220 --> 15:00.420
The next one is the tower SP Game Boy exclusive from the Vavarium

15:01.340 --> 15:06.780
It's going to be quoted as an in-depth sim experience has you design

15:06.780 --> 15:11.780
manage, build everyday running of a skyscraper.

15:11.780 --> 15:18.540
You can build a basement, or a luxury, or however what type you want it, but you run

15:18.540 --> 15:21.060
the place and have your tenants and everything.

15:21.060 --> 15:22.860
I just randomly thought of ActRaiser.

15:22.860 --> 15:26.140
I don't know why, but I just randomly thought of ActRaiser, when she was talking about,

15:26.140 --> 15:27.860
you know, you build the town and watch everything.

15:27.860 --> 15:31.180
I thought about ActRaiser and I thought, God damn, there's a game I miss.

15:31.180 --> 15:32.180
You know, they...

15:32.180 --> 15:35.300
Tonight is an episode for just reminiscing about...

15:35.300 --> 15:39.620
really needs a remake like Smash TV as like a first-person shooter what about

15:39.620 --> 15:45.380
Xbox 360 hello co-op online smash yeah I'm talking about something like unreal

15:45.380 --> 15:49.020
tournament or something like that where it's actually kind of the whole game is

15:49.020 --> 15:53.620
redone from the ground up that would be cool because Smash TV really a lot of

15:53.620 --> 15:55.980
play really awesome it's something in the air tonight or we're just like

15:55.980 --> 15:58.860
reminiscing about old shit all night maybe it's the end of the year thing

15:58.860 --> 16:03.380
we did get a lot of play in my house like lately like in the last week

16:03.380 --> 16:04.780
The Xbox 360 one?

16:04.780 --> 16:05.280
Yeah.

16:05.280 --> 16:06.980
Isn't that weird?

16:06.980 --> 16:11.180
Some of the most talked about Xbox 360 things right now

16:11.180 --> 16:16.860
is old shit, like Smash TV, and not so much that Geometry Wars is old shit, but it's

16:16.860 --> 16:17.820
pretty shit

16:17.820 --> 16:24.100
that you could do on old style consoles probably, but yet it's so cool and pretty.

16:24.100 --> 16:24.600
I don't know.

16:24.600 --> 16:25.900
It's like updated asteroids.

16:25.900 --> 16:27.260
I don't know how to explain it.

16:27.260 --> 16:29.580
But back to Sega.

16:29.580 --> 16:30.180
Sorry.

16:30.180 --> 16:36.980
The PSP title, there's not any release date yet, however, the Tower SP is slated for March

16:36.980 --> 16:37.980
2006 release.

16:37.980 --> 16:38.980
Awesome.

16:38.980 --> 16:41.540
We'll be looking for that.

16:41.540 --> 16:43.020
All right.

16:43.020 --> 16:44.620
Let's go to some law.

16:44.620 --> 16:46.860
What's going on in the law, the law, the law, the law?

16:46.860 --> 16:50.300
Follow up to a story a few weeks ago.

16:50.300 --> 16:54.260
You know that Senator Clinton and Senator Lieberman were doing this bill, the Family

16:54.260 --> 16:56.480
Entertainment Protection Act.

16:56.480 --> 17:01.200
Just a follow-up, it is now officially before Congress, granted it'll probably be one of

17:01.200 --> 17:03.800
the first things they pick up when Congress goes back into session.

17:03.800 --> 17:06.840
So you'll see some fun debates about this.

17:06.840 --> 17:11.800
If you have a very strong position one way or the other on this, I urge you to write

17:11.800 --> 17:15.840
your senator because this is going to be what they talk about when they come back.

17:15.840 --> 17:22.000
So you know, write your representatives and tell them how you feel, but just be professional.

17:22.000 --> 17:25.220
Don't write them emails that go, you know, you fucking fuck, you know, don't do that

17:25.220 --> 17:30.020
because that's just gonna make you look like an ass. Be professional. Have a

17:30.020 --> 17:35.300
friend proofread it if you're not sure. In other law news, an Alabama judge has

17:35.300 --> 17:41.500
said this is denied. It was a lawsuit filed against Take-Two by families of

17:41.500 --> 17:46.740
police officers. It was a Grand Theft Auto inspired basically saying that

17:46.740 --> 17:51.020
Grand Theft Auto inspired my kids to, or inspired these kids, not my kids,

17:51.020 --> 17:55.960
Inspired these kids to kill the cops in the family suit take two it got thrown out

17:57.740 --> 18:02.480
Kind of interesting Alabama is kind of the home of all this stuff lately because wasn't that also where a

18:03.400 --> 18:05.240
Jack Thompson's

18:05.240 --> 18:10.700
Right right to practice law kind of got like yeah, put it booted out something guess what this was the same judge

18:12.300 --> 18:17.900
Same judge judge James Moore. He must be the only judge in Alabama. I don't know bless my home state

18:17.900 --> 18:23.900
You know what's funny? Hearing Judge James Moore makes me think of Jay Moore. That's a funny thought.

18:23.900 --> 18:27.900
Give this guy a TV show. This is the judge I want to see on TV.

18:27.900 --> 18:35.900
He absolutely gets major kudos from me. It makes me proud to be an Alabamian. Yep, makes my heart hurt.

18:35.900 --> 18:43.900
Alright, let's move on. Loki, what do you got for us tonight? Talk to me a little bit about 360. Tell us about 360.

18:43.900 --> 18:48.900
Well first off, I know this wasn't on your list, but what happened with the Best Buy

18:48.900 --> 18:49.900
thing?

18:49.900 --> 18:52.820
Like, there was the list on the internet that said that all these Best Buyers are going

18:52.820 --> 18:53.820
to have the game.

18:53.820 --> 18:54.820
What happened?

18:54.820 --> 18:58.160
Well, the whole drama behind the Best Buy thing is this basically was like a second

18:58.160 --> 18:59.160
launch.

18:59.160 --> 19:04.740
There was supposed to be about 300,000 units being sent throughout the entire United States.

19:04.740 --> 19:08.420
So same kind of allocations they were getting before.

19:08.420 --> 19:11.320
Now here are the rules for this.

19:11.320 --> 19:15.340
receiving their shipments on Friday. They were supposed to hold them for Sunday for

19:15.340 --> 19:18.900
their sale that was going to be advertised. They were not to pre-sell them. They were

19:18.900 --> 19:26.380
not to open early. Did they follow that? No. They sold them early. They opened early. People

19:26.380 --> 19:30.680
were disappointed. When you say they, select stores, because we can't pinpoint who. Select

19:30.680 --> 19:36.480
stores opened early and sold early. And so people were camping in line. And from what

19:36.480 --> 19:41.260
I hear too, some stores didn't even get them. And so people were camping in line and they

19:41.260 --> 19:46.180
get up there, oh by the way, they're sold out. Would you like a compact laptop instead?

19:46.180 --> 19:55.260
So it was basically a lot of crap that hit the fan. It wasn't pretty. And a lot of people

19:55.260 --> 20:00.240
waited in line and some of them did get them, a lot of people did not. People still pissed

20:00.240 --> 20:05.940
at Microsoft. But this is going to happen all over again because apparently another

20:05.940 --> 20:17.140
shipments coming in on the 22nd so yeah it's pretty bad but you know it's only

20:17.140 --> 20:22.340
you know right now it's really hard to find. What can you do? People are desperate they want

20:22.340 --> 20:27.460
that system for their little screaming brat. Who will probably not even know how

20:27.460 --> 20:33.900
to use the damn thing. Exactly. We'll see. And what's funny even better is they

20:33.900 --> 20:38.300
have the Japanese launch, what, last week or so?

20:38.300 --> 20:41.820
40% of the units sold, 60% sit on shelves.

20:41.820 --> 20:46.580
Import your consoles! Though I don't think that'll work because they're region-coded, right?

20:46.580 --> 20:49.060
Not all the games. Some of them are, some of them aren't.

20:49.060 --> 20:53.100
Interesting. I don't think it's worth it, because if you want to try and take it online, it's not worth it.

20:53.100 --> 20:57.460
It's not, but the only reason why they didn't sell is because all the Japanese launch games got pushed back.

20:57.460 --> 21:02.660
Dead or Alive being the closest one to launch that people were really looking forward to.

21:02.660 --> 21:07.220
Ridge Racer was the top game for the Japanese market, and then of course, you know, their

21:07.220 --> 21:14.540
RPGs like 99 Nights, well, sort of a Dynasty Warriors type game, and then Enchanted Arm,

21:14.540 --> 21:22.420
you know, the really big RPGs, they aren't coming out until next year. So it sucks.

21:22.420 --> 21:23.980
What else is going on in 360 News?

21:23.980 --> 21:28.980
Other than that, they do have some really cool stuff that they've added to the Xbox

21:28.980 --> 21:34.580
live marketplace which is really good and some new content, new cars to download, forage

21:34.580 --> 21:37.900
racer 6, those are all free.

21:37.900 --> 21:44.340
They're gonna actually be adding a demo for full auto coming pretty soon, I think in this

21:44.340 --> 21:49.580
week or so, and I'm really looking forward to that, which is gonna be awesome.

21:49.580 --> 21:53.040
Now I read about this and I thought this sounded pretty cool, that the Xbox 360 is actually

21:53.040 --> 21:57.660
having a high definition trailer for Mission Impossible 3 is available on the Xbox Live

21:57.660 --> 22:02.300
marketplace and you can download this as some type of like um... exclusive

22:02.300 --> 22:05.660
trailer thing you can download very interesting kinda

22:05.660 --> 22:07.220
buys into that whole

22:07.220 --> 22:12.140
the 360 and the next-gen systems maybe more than a gaming system

22:12.140 --> 22:13.460
they're trying

22:13.460 --> 22:17.420
they do that, they did that with Narnia, they had a trailer for Narnia in there and stuff

22:17.420 --> 22:21.420
uh... I've seen the Mission Impossible 3 trailer, it's just a teaser

22:21.420 --> 22:22.520
and it's like eh

22:22.520 --> 22:25.980
but think about that, if you can download the trailer on the marketplace what's to stop them

22:25.980 --> 22:28.020
later on from offering movies for download in the marketplace.

22:28.020 --> 22:29.020
True, they could.

22:29.020 --> 22:32.220
I see that as a logical next step for what the system is going to do.

22:32.220 --> 22:34.300
And Sony, same thing.

22:34.300 --> 22:36.180
I wouldn't doubt it.

22:36.180 --> 22:37.740
It makes sense.

22:37.740 --> 22:41.580
And I really do like the way they have the games online for free download.

22:41.580 --> 22:42.580
That's really good.

22:42.580 --> 22:44.200
They try out the demos and stuff.

22:44.200 --> 22:45.200
I think it's great.

22:45.200 --> 22:49.060
And they'll really help them sell their games.

22:49.060 --> 22:51.260
It's a really good tool that they have on there.

22:51.260 --> 22:54.180
And plus the extra content is really awesome.

22:54.180 --> 22:58.520
I do like the fact that they have downloadable stuff, plus you can pay for other things like

22:58.520 --> 23:03.720
they have some extra sound music tracks you can get for Ridge Racer, which is really cool

23:03.720 --> 23:04.720
as well.

23:04.720 --> 23:09.440
Now you were talking about something like somebody really wanted to get retro with their

23:09.440 --> 23:10.440
360.

23:10.440 --> 23:12.160
They had to get painfully retro with the 360.

23:12.160 --> 23:13.360
What the hell's going on with this here?

23:13.360 --> 23:18.400
There's been a few case mods that have come out since the 360's launch.

23:18.400 --> 23:21.640
One of them recently this week, actually there's two.

23:21.640 --> 23:26.640
The first one was this one entitled the Extreme Edition, and basically they've done a red

23:26.640 --> 23:31.940
paint job on it, added a nice little window to it, and changed all the LEDs to red, which

23:31.940 --> 23:32.940
looks pretty cool.

23:32.940 --> 23:38.080
And that's actually being sold on eBay for thousands of dollars.

23:38.080 --> 23:44.760
Then the other one, which is less practical and less cool, would be a 360 being put inside

23:44.760 --> 23:46.360
of an Atari 2600.

23:46.360 --> 23:49.280
Hey, I think that's pretty cool.

23:49.280 --> 23:54.380
well you have to see it to understand how it looks ugly as hell

23:54.380 --> 23:57.460
it is pretty damn ugly but

23:57.460 --> 24:01.560
you know hey give people time to put it in anything

24:01.560 --> 24:05.600
I don't praise the modding community enough but

24:05.600 --> 24:08.760
damn they can be creative sometimes seriously not just

24:08.760 --> 24:12.520
just the modding and cracking and hacking scene in general like

24:12.520 --> 24:15.560
damn there's some creative things people come up with it's like

24:15.560 --> 24:19.000
why the hell would you do that because I can

24:19.000 --> 24:23.920
Why would you put a 360 in the 2600?

24:23.920 --> 24:24.920
Because I can, bitch.

24:24.920 --> 24:29.400
I don't know, but that's one of the things that they've done.

24:29.400 --> 24:34.040
Something else that we should note about the Xbox 360, Microsoft is saying that these rumors

24:34.040 --> 24:40.680
about HD DVDs, the fact that we're going to bring out another 360 that does HD DVDs, no.

24:40.680 --> 24:42.140
Not happening next year.

24:42.140 --> 24:45.020
These rumors are crap.

24:45.020 --> 24:48.960
in both america and japan has not announced anything regarding the

24:48.960 --> 24:53.060
possibility of a next generation dvd drive being placed in the xbox three

24:53.060 --> 24:55.540
sixty this coming from a microsoft spokesperson

24:55.540 --> 24:59.160
there are currently no plans to release an xbox three sixty equipped with the

24:59.160 --> 25:02.100
next generation dvd player

25:02.100 --> 25:06.640
yes sense because i added the yet myself but yet makes sense because hdvd we

25:06.640 --> 25:09.660
don't know if that's the format they're going to be going to

25:09.660 --> 25:12.560
completely random subject here but i don't care it's one of those shows

25:12.560 --> 25:14.620
tonight uh...

25:14.620 --> 25:17.720
I helped my friend go shopping for Christmas present my friend was buying a

25:17.720 --> 25:22.280
DVD recorder for a friend and there's all these recording formats I don't know

25:22.280 --> 25:23.180
much about it

25:23.180 --> 25:27.840
but there's like the R's, the RW, the R pluses or whatever they are

25:27.840 --> 25:31.240
all these things and they're like all these different formats and no

25:31.240 --> 25:33.360
standardization and these recorders are

25:33.360 --> 25:36.520
huge Christmas things. This is kinda dangerous because it's like

25:36.520 --> 25:39.560
VHS and Beta all over again. We need to find a standard.

25:39.560 --> 25:43.280
The actual standalone recorders there's

25:43.280 --> 25:47.900
They have the plus and the minus, and then the R, plus or minus R is what it is.

25:47.900 --> 25:51.340
See, I couldn't make sense of all of it because they all sound too similar for me.

25:51.340 --> 25:56.420
Well, they are. They are very similar. Plus and minus R are very similar, and then RW is just a rewritable one.

25:56.420 --> 25:59.740
Not similar enough, because one won't play on the other, depending on the machine.

25:59.740 --> 26:07.740
Some will play both. Mine will actually play both, like on the burner on my laptop, but I think it only records on plus Rs.

26:07.740 --> 26:18.040
I think PlusR has been the format that's actually what's being used now. Like, I know my DVD burner and my computer will do both, but it burns basically one format now.

26:18.040 --> 26:21.740
I'm behind the times. I have no DVD burner, recordery, that stuff, I'm...

26:21.740 --> 26:23.140
You're not missing much.

26:23.140 --> 26:29.840
Actually, you know, it's helped me out so much because I have a 250GB hard drive on my PC that's almost full.

26:29.840 --> 26:31.440
Mine's not even near full yet, so...

26:31.440 --> 26:38.440
But I can just go onto my network, burn off my stuff off of my laptop, save myself some space.

26:38.440 --> 26:45.440
Alright. Well, that's okay. Enough 360 talk. DarkSucker, you have a story about another next-gen console. What's going on?

26:45.440 --> 26:47.440
Finally, some more stuff about the revolution.

26:47.440 --> 26:48.440
Woohoo!

26:48.440 --> 26:57.440
Okay, apparently the system has been, some dev kits have been released to some third parties, so there's been some feedback received.

26:57.440 --> 27:02.440
So far, it's looking like just the information that's been given back.

27:02.440 --> 27:08.440
It's going to be powered by IBM CPU codenamed Broadway, very similar to the Gecko CPU in the GameCube.

27:08.440 --> 27:18.440
It should run about twice the clock speed, actually up to three times the overall performance of the GameCube processor.

27:18.440 --> 27:24.440
And they have an ATI graphics chip codenamed Hollywood, which I find so ridiculous.

27:24.440 --> 27:25.780
interesting

27:25.780 --> 27:28.120
uh...

27:28.120 --> 27:32.660
just to look at this yet though they're saying that the uh... it's uh... going to be

27:32.660 --> 27:37.080
about two and a half times more powerful than the gamecube which is

27:37.080 --> 27:38.420
the gamecube wasn't

27:38.420 --> 27:39.980
too bad at all

27:39.980 --> 27:43.820
uh... there's also a note on here that it's gonna pretty much use standard

27:43.820 --> 27:46.380
dvds but as a slot loader

27:46.380 --> 27:49.760
it would actually be able to take in the old gamecube

27:49.760 --> 27:52.060
oh ok cool

27:52.060 --> 28:02.060
I think that that's actually pretty cool because the small disk, there hasn't been anything slot loading that would take those without some type of special trade to go with it.

28:02.060 --> 28:07.060
The thing is that developers don't really know how to treat it.

28:07.060 --> 28:16.060
They're talking about it being easy to program for, though, on a PC, and you actually do more enhancements to it when you're porting it over.

28:16.060 --> 28:22.080
But right now they've just been treating it like they're programming a GameCube game because the library is very similar

28:23.020 --> 28:28.960
Now this all news this whole news about the more powerful stuff. It's all fine and good, but I'm not big on specs

28:28.960 --> 28:31.780
I really and I know a lot of our listeners are really big on specs

28:31.780 --> 28:37.020
and they want to know exactly what the systems will do but guys remember the golden rule of gaming everybody say it with me a

28:37.700 --> 28:41.340
System is only as good as the games that are on it

28:41.340 --> 28:48.680
So this thing could have rocket fuel projection lightning laser or whatever if the games suck ain't gonna matter

28:48.680 --> 28:51.220
There is actually one other note that I'd like to mention

28:51.560 --> 28:55.800
There's speculation that it could possibly enter the market for about 150

28:56.760 --> 29:01.580
Now that I've heard before yeah, at least 99 now. It's 150, but that that's

29:02.220 --> 29:08.220
More than that that would be I think the smartest thing Nintendo could do if they're gonna come in the market last come in cheapest

29:08.220 --> 29:13.940
But what make everybody else price slash what surprises me though is the fact that they'd go with the standard format DVD cuz Nintendo

29:13.940 --> 29:16.580
Has been all about their you know having their own

29:17.680 --> 29:19.460
storage

29:19.460 --> 29:24.700
You know they made their money on the on the 64 with those humongous cartridges

29:24.700 --> 29:29.660
They had see I think part of the reason they lost with the GameCube or at least came in last place in America with

29:29.660 --> 29:36.700
The GameCube is because it didn't support DVDs and honestly that's what the square away. I've said this before I think the reason why

29:36.700 --> 29:40.960
PlayStation 2 dominated the way it did is because people were buying them as

29:40.960 --> 29:44.640
DVD players. Even though, you know, and that you know you the first gen they say

29:44.640 --> 29:47.160
you weren't supposed to whatever it doesn't matter if you were supposed to

29:47.160 --> 29:50.140
or not I know people were buying because this is right when DVD players are

29:50.140 --> 29:53.200
getting big people were buying these PlayStation 2 saying you know what I

29:53.200 --> 29:56.800
would be a DVD player and a PlayStation it's great it plays my own games it's

29:56.800 --> 30:00.960
awesome I seriously think that is a huge part of the reason that and the golden

30:00.960 --> 30:05.160
rule is that PlayStation you know had a lot a lot a lot of games on it but I

30:05.160 --> 30:08.060
I think that's a huge reason why PlayStation 2 did so successfully was

30:08.060 --> 30:09.460
because it supported DVDs.

30:09.460 --> 30:13.100
The backwards compatibility was a big thing, however, I did find it very

30:13.100 --> 30:16.340
hilarious and I think that it's the Japanese one that had more issues with

30:16.340 --> 30:18.020
this than the US one,

30:18.020 --> 30:21.620
is that if you had on your texture smoothing,

30:21.620 --> 30:24.660
it would do very interesting things to some of the older games.

30:24.660 --> 30:29.100
Like, I remember playing Bust-N-Move 2 with texture smoothing on,

30:29.100 --> 30:31.660
and Comet's head disappeared.

30:31.660 --> 30:33.860
In one of her legs.

30:33.860 --> 30:37.740
She can't really bust a move with only one leg now can she? No. Or without a head.

30:37.740 --> 30:39.640
It was pretty funny.

30:39.640 --> 30:41.220
You know random

30:41.220 --> 30:44.540
random not related to anything comments because we're talking about losing heads

30:44.540 --> 30:47.900
and stuff. Somebody actually put a photoshop in the MySpace, because you don't have people on MySpace,

30:47.900 --> 30:50.180
they leave these comments that are just completely random.

30:50.180 --> 30:52.940
One of my buddies actually put a comment on my MySpace that says

30:52.940 --> 30:56.620
France France Revolution and it just shows the DDR cover with no head, the

30:56.620 --> 30:59.940
heads on the ground. Get it? Because in France they beheaded people.

30:59.940 --> 31:02.620
Oh what is that?

31:02.620 --> 31:06.620
Something in the air tonight. I think it was those brownies you brought earlier. Are you sure those are Starbucks brownies?

31:06.620 --> 31:12.620
They were Starbucks brownies. They have caffeine in them and Starbucks makes you stupid.

31:12.620 --> 31:15.620
We are never getting sponsorship from Starbucks.

31:15.620 --> 31:17.620
Good job. Good job on that.

31:17.620 --> 31:23.620
I think now is a good time in the show to talk about the real world and life out there.

31:23.620 --> 31:27.620
Because, you know, if we played games all day long, we would have no time to bake brownies.

31:27.620 --> 31:31.940
So, um, that's why DarkSakura is here, is to remind us there's a whole world outside

31:31.940 --> 31:37.180
your Xbox 360 or your GameCube or Playstation, whatever, and she's here to bring you her

31:37.180 --> 31:41.420
advice column for some real-life, down-to-earth advice.

31:41.420 --> 31:46.260
DarkSakura, help the children of America this Christmas week, and the adults that listen

31:46.260 --> 31:47.340
to this show, too.

31:47.340 --> 31:48.740
Help them with some advice.

31:48.740 --> 31:50.460
What are you talking about tonight?

31:50.460 --> 31:53.480
How to survive a high-rise hotel fire.

31:53.480 --> 31:57.580
This could be a lot of folks going on vacation for the holidays, might be staying in a high

31:57.580 --> 31:58.580
High rise?

31:58.580 --> 31:59.580
Good to know.

31:59.580 --> 32:00.580
What's up?

32:00.580 --> 32:01.580
1.

32:01.580 --> 32:03.940
Feel the hotel doorknob with the back of your hand.

32:03.940 --> 32:08.380
If the knob is cool, open the door and escape via the nearest stairwell, keeping low if

32:08.380 --> 32:09.380
the hallway is smoke-filled.

32:09.380 --> 32:10.380
Duh.

32:10.380 --> 32:11.380
2.

32:11.380 --> 32:15.740
If the doorknob is hot, wedge wet towels under the door to keep smoke out.

32:15.740 --> 32:19.620
Cover your head with wet towels and sheets to protect yourself from smoke inhalation.

32:19.620 --> 32:23.180
You can also use the towel to signal rescue personnel at the windows.

32:23.180 --> 32:24.180
3.

32:24.180 --> 32:28.460
If the air is getting worse, try to kick through the closet wall into the adjacent room.

32:28.460 --> 32:31.820
Knock on the wall until you hear a hollow sound, which indicates the absence of wall

32:31.820 --> 32:35.000
studs, and then use both feet to kick through the drywall.

32:35.000 --> 32:37.020
But my final piece of advice on this one?

32:37.020 --> 32:38.020
Yes.

32:38.020 --> 32:42.160
If you see a little sign outside the hotel that says, Now Filming the Towering Inferno

32:42.160 --> 32:45.340
Part 2, stay somewhere else.

32:45.340 --> 32:48.300
Good thoughts, good thoughts.

32:48.300 --> 32:50.300
Or how about don't play with fire indoors.

32:50.300 --> 32:52.020
Or unplug your Christmas tree.

32:52.020 --> 32:58.380
staying a hotel on the first floor stay at Motel 6 we'll leave the light on for

32:58.380 --> 33:05.020
you so many e3 Motel 6 stories I could tell on this show but I didn't stay at

33:05.020 --> 33:09.420
the Motel 6 I but we did a Motel 6 on Hollywood Boulevard but that's for

33:09.420 --> 33:13.740
another show that's for another show huh you saw the place we had to stay at

33:13.740 --> 33:18.520
though I know I know but we had crack whores dark sock rack crack whores we

33:18.520 --> 33:25.520
had tiny rooms. Anyway, Loki, give us a story, I don't care what, take us away from this.

33:29.540 --> 33:36.540
On the topic of crack whores, we have, it was actually brought to everyone's attention

33:36.820 --> 33:42.200
again, this old mod that was out for the original Zelda, a ROM that's been floating around on

33:42.200 --> 33:47.380
the internet called Zelda Challenge the Outlands, and it's been kind of put out there, it's

33:47.380 --> 33:52.940
basically a completely redone version of Zelda. Somebody put this on Dig this week, huh? Yeah.

33:52.940 --> 33:57.220
Because I saw this on Dig and I thought, this shit's old. I saw this like two years ago.

33:57.220 --> 34:03.820
Yes, it's old. But it just, you know, it brings to attention if you do have like a PSP. That's

34:03.820 --> 34:08.620
kind of my thought. It's like, okay, well now people are emulating on a PSP and stuff.

34:08.620 --> 34:12.740
And there's also a lot of things we don't talk about are ROM hacks. And there's a lot

34:12.740 --> 34:18.940
of good ROM hacks out there, a lot of really bad ones, but this one apparently is one of

34:18.940 --> 34:19.940
the good ones.

34:19.940 --> 34:22.820
Super Penis Brothers, where all they do is they turn Mario and Luigi into, like, they

34:22.820 --> 34:29.380
use the, or no, I'll tell you the best worst mod I ever saw was an old Japanese game, it's

34:29.380 --> 34:33.620
called Nuts and Milk, and they never released it here for obvious reasons, because, Teehee

34:33.620 --> 34:34.620
Nuts, right?

34:34.620 --> 34:38.340
Well somebody actually went in and Teehee Nuts, they turned all the characters into,

34:38.340 --> 34:45.060
you know, nuts, and the milk was, you know, that gross.

34:45.060 --> 34:51.180
I downloaded Links of Awakening, the old, you know, Game Boy one, and I didn't find

34:51.180 --> 34:54.380
out until after I started playing it that it had been hacked, and his sword was like

34:54.380 --> 34:57.660
a dildo, and all the text had been changed.

34:57.660 --> 34:59.220
That's so classy.

34:59.220 --> 35:04.540
Anyways, this one has more dungeons, in fact, new weapons and whatnot.

35:04.540 --> 35:09.580
Pretty cool, so you should go definitely check it out, and you can probably find it on any

35:09.580 --> 35:11.380
of your ROM sites out there.

35:11.380 --> 35:14.240
Zelda Challenge Outworld.

35:14.240 --> 35:15.240
Check that out.

35:15.240 --> 35:17.380
DarkStalker, do you have some news about Quake 4?

35:17.380 --> 35:19.420
Yep, I sure do.

35:19.420 --> 35:23.540
Little tiny piece of news.

35:23.540 --> 35:29.660
Aspire has taken pity on Mac users.

35:29.660 --> 35:32.760
Quake 4 will be coming out for the Mac.

35:32.760 --> 35:34.340
Next year, sometime.

35:34.340 --> 35:37.040
going to be available for both PowerPC and Intel Macs.

35:37.040 --> 35:41.120
Good to hear. Glad to see the Mac users getting some love over there.

35:41.120 --> 35:46.420
You know, Mac users kind of get on the butt end of a lot of gaming jokes and, you know,

35:46.420 --> 35:50.220
Macs aren't bad, they're good systems. They've got World of Warcraft.

35:50.220 --> 35:53.900
That's true, that's true. Well, good to hear they're getting some of the new games.

35:53.900 --> 35:57.900
Now, you had an interesting story, Dark Sakura, about, like,

35:57.900 --> 36:01.520
myths about games. What was this about, some story you found?

36:01.520 --> 36:07.120
give me a second sure or two okay and actually uh one of our listeners linked to this to us

36:07.120 --> 36:17.040
oh super our uh fabulous uh rubway oh of course yes um and it really goes into detail on these

36:17.040 --> 36:23.200
but i'll just try to i guess summarize as best as i can that you have a link to this is this

36:23.200 --> 36:28.800
a quick link that you can read out yeah i can read it out it's pbs.org slash kcts

36:28.800 --> 36:34.260
slash video game revolution slash impact slash myths dot HTML okay you might have

36:34.260 --> 36:37.380
to post on the forums too but that's into PBS like like public broadcasting

36:37.380 --> 36:41.340
system I guess oh interesting okay um but the first one is that the

36:41.340 --> 36:44.580
availability of video games has led to an epidemic of youth violence and

36:44.580 --> 36:49.340
basically it's like I we talked about before that's totally not the case hmm

36:49.340 --> 36:53.700
in fact the overwhelming majority just a quote here the overwhelming majority of

36:53.700 --> 37:01.880
kids who do not commit antisocial acts they're talking about that uh that

37:01.880 --> 37:06.340
basically it's all those reports that came back with our some of our national

37:06.340 --> 37:12.380
facilities have proven that no that's really not true hmm it's just video

37:12.380 --> 37:15.480
games can be a very social thing sometimes I mean seriously get a get a

37:15.480 --> 37:20.940
full game of Mario Party going you'll see more social it forget it well number

37:20.940 --> 37:26.900
scientific evidence links video games play with youth with youth aggression

37:26.900 --> 37:35.100
but this the studies that they've done have been really inconclusive their

37:35.100 --> 37:41.540
methodology has been criticized they're not thorough research you know there's

37:41.540 --> 37:46.940
also they're not accounting for it's mentioned on here they're the risk

37:46.940 --> 37:52.100
factor coupled with more immediate real-world influences I mean pretty much

37:52.100 --> 37:59.480
you learn you violence is I'd say it's actually a more instinctive human trait

37:59.480 --> 38:04.280
if somebody is going to be more prone to violent behavior it's going to be a

38:04.280 --> 38:10.560
combination of home influence and biological predisposition because they've

38:10.560 --> 38:14.520
even proved that Wow although the article doesn't go into that that's

38:14.520 --> 38:19.360
something I know. Three, children are the primary market for video games. We've talked

38:19.360 --> 38:22.200
about that too. It's the average buyer is 37 years old.

38:22.200 --> 38:27.840
Right. Well, no, wait a minute though. Some video games children are the target market.

38:27.840 --> 38:30.780
For instance, I don't know any adult, well, okay, I know some, but I don't know many adults

38:30.780 --> 38:37.320
that would buy, you know, SpongeBob goes under Bikini Bottom, whatever. You know those titles

38:37.320 --> 38:40.240
that are definitely targeted at kids. Most of the games marketed though are for the older

38:40.240 --> 38:49.280
true for almost no girls play video games I'm high bullshit well said five

38:49.280 --> 38:52.800
because games are used to train soldiers to kill they have the same impact on

38:52.800 --> 38:59.040
kids who play them and this one I would like to point out I'm just gonna read a

38:59.040 --> 39:03.080
little bit of this former military psychologist and moral reformer David

39:03.080 --> 39:06.600
Grossman argues that because the military uses games and training

39:06.600 --> 39:10.860
including he claims training soldiers to shoot and kill the generation of young

39:10.860 --> 39:14.460
people who play such games are primarily being brutalized and conditioned to be

39:14.460 --> 39:18.140
aggressive if they're in their everyday social interactions now this says his

39:18.140 --> 39:22.560
model only works if we remove training and education from a meaning meaningful

39:22.560 --> 39:26.940
cultural context we assume leaders have no conscious goals and that they show no

39:26.940 --> 39:31.140
resistance to what they are being taught I'm sorry learners we assume they and

39:31.140 --> 39:34.180
will unwittingly apply what they've learned in a fantasy environment to

39:34.180 --> 39:40.060
real-world aspects. Um, no. You know, and I agree with the rest of this is

39:40.060 --> 39:45.620
basically pointing out that the games are for training military are

39:45.620 --> 39:49.540
specifically geared toward training and they know that it is geared toward their

39:49.540 --> 39:54.300
training. For a child playing a game, in their head, it's a game. They don't have

39:54.300 --> 39:57.500
to go out and kill somebody the next day. Let me throw this out there, just kind of

39:57.500 --> 40:05.260
discussion item America's Army I think that that's more of a enlistment tool I

40:05.260 --> 40:09.300
know a lot of people that play this just for the game though and nothing to do

40:09.300 --> 40:12.220
with the enlistment aspect of it it's actually a really popular game it kind

40:12.220 --> 40:16.180
of has a very cult cult like following to it but I've got my copies I just

40:16.180 --> 40:18.180
thought I'd throw that out there because it's kind of a fusion of what you're

40:18.180 --> 40:22.220
talking about and those bullet points you wanna bring up no um yeah actually

40:22.220 --> 40:29.220
video games are not a meaningful form of expression

40:31.740 --> 40:35.660
what about mario paint? I expressed a lot in that game

40:35.660 --> 40:39.980
well the thing is that not all games are are violent

40:39.980 --> 40:43.820
we have like you're talking about final fantasy 4 having a beautiful story

40:43.820 --> 40:47.340
you know that's just a really narrow-minded

40:47.340 --> 40:50.820
and you know as far as like say for example when you play the Sims

40:50.820 --> 40:58.820
You know, that's actually very expressive. You control the people's lives in there, you can have them interact.

40:58.820 --> 41:04.820
What about your online games? There's plenty of room for expression.

41:04.820 --> 41:08.820
Oh hell, MMOs are all about expression half the time.

41:08.820 --> 41:13.820
7. Video game play is socially isolating. Hi MMOs again.

41:13.820 --> 41:16.820
We have friends over at our house.

41:16.820 --> 41:21.380
Well, but that can go either way, because some people can sit on an MMO all day long.

41:21.380 --> 41:24.820
Of course, we've heard those horrible stories coming out of, you know, many different places

41:24.820 --> 41:30.240
about that folks die from forgetting to eat and drink from playing their MMOs all day,

41:30.240 --> 41:36.260
so that can kind of go either way, but, you know, games don't socially isolate you.

41:36.260 --> 41:40.300
Well there's a comment on here that, in fact, I'll just read a little bit of it.

41:40.300 --> 41:45.800
Much video game play is social, almost 60% of frequent gamers play with friends, 33%

41:45.800 --> 41:49.880
with siblings and 25% play with spouses and parents.

41:49.880 --> 41:53.380
Even games designed for single players are being played socially, with one person giving

41:53.380 --> 41:55.560
advice to another holding a joystick.

41:55.560 --> 41:57.560
You're doing it all wrong!

41:57.560 --> 42:06.440
Well, you know, we have people over at our house playing all the time when Need for Speed

42:06.440 --> 42:11.560
Underground is a single player game, but Dan and his friend Will pass the controller back

42:11.560 --> 42:12.560
all the time.

42:12.560 --> 42:18.920
You know, they each have their own cars. There's the stealth either stealth Evo many of us know this

42:19.560 --> 42:23.600
Brothers, I know anyway, actually what my husband is doing right now, but

42:24.280 --> 42:27.920
Anything else cuz I'm last one. Okay, and video gameplay is

42:28.760 --> 42:29.800
desensitizing

42:29.800 --> 42:36.960
Classic study of play behavior among primates just that apes make basic distinction between play fighting and actual combat

42:36.960 --> 42:45.600
um we're not I'm sorry we're not monkeys but still you know this is I think that

42:45.600 --> 42:50.280
having the game here and this actually mentions a little bit of this that it's

42:50.280 --> 42:58.200
an outlet it can be good it can be used to let out this aggression that's within

42:58.200 --> 43:02.400
people so that you're better able to cope with the real world they're

43:02.400 --> 43:07.040
they're wanting to prove that you know playing a violent game makes you more

43:07.040 --> 43:12.480
violent outside was this a TV show because it's on pbs.org it was this a TV

43:12.480 --> 43:16.960
special I know it should be I think it should be I think that it should be an

43:16.960 --> 43:19.660
episode every freaking channel this should be an episode of Penn & Teller's

43:19.660 --> 43:26.920
bullshit right here 60 minutes that's a good point anyway but at any rate you

43:26.920 --> 43:32.080
know their whole argument with this one is that you would basically lose empathy

43:32.080 --> 43:36.720
empathy for real world situations by experiencing them in a virtual environment.

43:36.720 --> 43:38.160
Not the case.

43:38.160 --> 43:44.080
In fact, by giving yourself an outlet in one forum, I think that it would make a person

43:44.080 --> 43:49.000
better able to cope in a real forum.

43:49.000 --> 43:52.760
Interesting stuff and interesting discussions that that article kind of invokes there.

43:52.760 --> 43:53.880
So thank you for sharing with us.

43:53.880 --> 43:54.880
That was a very good one.

43:54.880 --> 43:56.480
Actually, we need to thank our buddy Rob.

43:56.480 --> 43:57.480
All right.

43:57.480 --> 43:59.480
Thank you, buddy Rob.

43:59.480 --> 44:03.780
Okay, let's talk about a good ol' war game.

44:03.780 --> 44:05.780
Tell us about Gears of War.

44:05.780 --> 44:08.500
Gears of War is sexy, that's all you need to know.

44:08.500 --> 44:13.940
Now actually they released some footage from, I believe it was Zero Hour, where they were

44:13.940 --> 44:17.980
showing off the game, and it's sexy.

44:17.980 --> 44:25.140
This right here is the killer app for the 360, definitely.

44:25.140 --> 44:31.540
What they did show is just the amazing graphics in it as well as kind of different things

44:31.540 --> 44:33.580
that they're doing with the storyline stuff.

44:33.580 --> 44:36.180
It's really cool.

44:36.180 --> 44:40.060
But that's one you're definitely going to be wanting to check out when it comes out

44:40.060 --> 44:42.820
I believe in April or March.

44:42.820 --> 44:45.560
All right, sounds good.

44:45.560 --> 44:49.220
Let's go ahead and open up the old mailbag and see what our listeners have to say.

44:49.220 --> 44:54.020
Remember guys, if you want to send us an email, all you got to do, write us togo, T-O-G-O

44:54.020 --> 45:01.640
at OrangeLoungeRadio.com and DarkSakura will flame you if she finds it necessary, no just

45:01.640 --> 45:07.820
kidding, she very rarely, she very rarely flames our, well she sends me flame mails

45:07.820 --> 45:14.060
all the time, but that's behind the scenes stuff, to the listener, to the listener she's

45:14.060 --> 45:18.620
very cordial, so what are some letters that are begging to be read tonight?

45:18.620 --> 45:23.140
Well, um, actually, uh, a couple people won our friend codes in Animal Crossing.

45:23.140 --> 45:25.460
Do we have something on forums for that now?

45:25.460 --> 45:27.340
That's why I made that, uh, red.

45:27.340 --> 45:28.740
Oh, good segue, good segue.

45:28.740 --> 45:29.740
Sorry to keep you.

45:29.740 --> 45:36.540
If you go onto our, uh, forums at orangeloungeradio.com, there is a link under console gaming, there

45:36.540 --> 45:41.700
where we, I've posted my friend code for Animal Crossing, um, I haven't checked it lately,

45:41.700 --> 45:44.060
but, you know, we need to get more people on there.

45:44.060 --> 45:47.300
When I go back to Animal Crossing, I'll post my friend code, but for right now, it's not

45:47.300 --> 45:48.300
fancy for it.

45:48.300 --> 45:52.940
visit me in Danville. Not Danville, Hades. Danville is Danville. I'll post my husband's

45:52.940 --> 45:59.060
too. And Loki has OLR town, right? Yes. You guys are doing like Animal Crossing spam or

45:59.060 --> 46:04.020
something? Yes, we're doing Animal Crossing spam. Oh, that's great. In fact, I actually,

46:04.020 --> 46:12.300
I'm gonna open up a contest. A little, tidy contest. If you get a bottle from the ocean,

46:12.300 --> 46:19.300
a message in a bottle that has an orange little trade note written by me or Loki or Rob, then

46:19.300 --> 46:23.620
we'll send you a box of cookies. Okay, you're buying those cookies and shipping them. I'll

46:23.620 --> 46:27.380
buy the cookies and shipping them. Alright, good. They may be moldy by the time you get

46:27.380 --> 46:32.340
them, but I'll do it. Alright. Anything else in the mailbox? If you live in another country,

46:32.340 --> 46:36.780
I'll send you cookies that you can only get here. Girl Scout cookies. Delicious. Girl

46:36.780 --> 46:45.980
scale cookies all right moving on let's yeah you know we got a couple more

46:45.980 --> 46:51.380
listeners right in about the whole parental debate we actually got one

46:51.380 --> 46:55.100
person who didn't like our last episode oh because we talked about Animal

46:55.100 --> 46:58.340
Crossing too much oh well you know well what's the game of the week what are you

46:58.340 --> 47:03.740
supposed to do yeah sorry you're welcome to your bit we talk about other games

47:03.740 --> 47:08.580
to try to it just so happens to all three of us enjoy Animal Crossing so

47:08.580 --> 47:12.740
it's gonna come up all right whatever and you know we got a few thank yous

47:12.740 --> 47:16.900
from some of the parents for our reading the articles actually awesome the one

47:16.900 --> 47:21.900
that I was very impressed with Sloan that wrote us mm-hmm that was a very

47:21.900 --> 47:27.820
very good letter and he wrote back just to say that that you know he actually

47:27.820 --> 47:33.580
you know felt he was good to hear you know us read the letter and they also

47:33.580 --> 47:37.520
I also recognized that we weren't feeling very well.

47:37.520 --> 47:40.220
You know what, when we read your letter on the air,

47:40.220 --> 47:41.820
you should take this as a pat on the back,

47:41.820 --> 47:44.060
and what you should do, burn the episode to a CD

47:44.060 --> 47:45.600
and then pin it on the fridge.

47:45.600 --> 47:47.660
Just like when you did good art when you were in school,

47:47.660 --> 47:49.360
you pinned it on the fridge, you've done good.

47:49.360 --> 47:51.100
So you can pin a CD on the fridge,

47:51.100 --> 47:52.260
unless we flame you on air,

47:52.260 --> 47:54.100
then don't pin that on the fridge.

47:54.100 --> 47:57.760
But he gave us the okay to post that letter on the site.

47:57.760 --> 47:58.600
Great.

47:58.600 --> 48:00.900
So I will be doing that shortly within the week.

48:00.900 --> 48:01.740
Great.

48:01.740 --> 48:03.340
I've just been busy with finals.

48:03.340 --> 48:15.680
that's fun yeah um and someone actually sent us an email as a Mac man said in

48:15.680 --> 48:20.260
response to playing copyrighted music on a podcast as gun says there isn't a

48:20.260 --> 48:26.960
crime if there isn't a law it's kind of one of those things where you know just

48:26.960 --> 48:31.720
I don't know it's not let's not go there unless we have to if the show's

48:31.720 --> 48:36.960
direction makes us go there, then we'll do the copyrighted music thing, but no need for

48:36.960 --> 48:37.960
us right now.

48:37.960 --> 48:41.160
Who knows that there could be changes to the show in the future where we would want to

48:41.160 --> 48:42.160
go there?

48:42.160 --> 48:43.160
Who knows?

48:43.160 --> 48:44.160
Hint, hint.

48:44.160 --> 48:56.100
The last one is an article sent to us by our friend Sasuke about, in fact, I actually mentioned

48:56.100 --> 49:01.760
him in that other article I read, the ex-army ranger and West Point psychology professor

49:01.760 --> 49:09.280
Grossman, Lieutenant Colonel Dave Grossman. Apparently he's been all in demand by law

49:09.280 --> 49:15.080
enforcement agencies talking about video game violence when, you know, there's proof that

49:15.080 --> 49:17.720
we don't have the situation.

49:17.720 --> 49:22.840
Is this this other article you were going to talk about here? You want to? Okay, cool.

49:22.840 --> 49:24.800
Just making sure.

49:24.800 --> 49:28.880
I was trying to be all smooth and ninja-like with my recording skills.

49:28.880 --> 49:33.520
I'm scatterbrained tonight. I can't get my mind off Actraiser and how beautiful it is.

49:33.520 --> 49:36.760
We need a new Actraiser. I just, I said that!

49:36.760 --> 49:41.440
Anyway, see? Bad transition. Anyway. And anyway, he says that first-person shooters

49:41.440 --> 49:42.920
are murder simulators.

49:42.920 --> 49:48.000
You know what? Didn't Jack Thompson say that?

49:48.000 --> 49:51.280
I know. I don't know. These people are all in the same bed.

49:51.280 --> 49:57.520
they're all screwing each other. Anyway, anyway

49:57.520 --> 50:01.280
it's just and really it's more of the same bullshit we've had

50:01.280 --> 50:04.400
spewed out of many many people's mouths and

50:04.400 --> 50:10.240
my thought on all of this is please shut up. Y'all don't know what you're talking about

50:10.240 --> 50:15.040
it makes you sound like a big stupid butt head. All this hot coffee, seriously,

50:15.040 --> 50:19.240
if hot coffee really bothered you in 2005

50:19.240 --> 50:23.060
it's time to switch to decaf in 2006 iced latte

50:23.060 --> 50:26.480
no decaf just or do you know tea go to tea

50:26.480 --> 50:30.460
go to tea do some chai tea Loki oh I'm sorry anything else in the mail bag

50:30.460 --> 50:33.720
um nah alright well lots of links from Rob

50:33.720 --> 50:37.200
to go at orange lawns radio to orange lawns radio dot com

50:37.200 --> 50:40.320
and email us and love us uh Loki couple things

50:40.320 --> 50:44.120
yes um first being that we're getting into a new year

50:44.120 --> 50:47.800
what is one of the things you must do get a new calendar

50:47.800 --> 50:51.800
Well, PSPmagazines.com has you covered.

50:51.800 --> 50:53.800
But I don't want a new calendar!

50:53.800 --> 50:55.800
Well, you can have a sexy new calendar!

50:55.800 --> 50:56.800
Okay, nevermind.

50:56.800 --> 51:01.800
From Furham Magazine or other sites.

51:01.800 --> 51:07.800
They also have a calendar from Furham Magazine, the 2006 PSP calendar, featuring sexy babes.

51:07.800 --> 51:09.800
A PSP calendar.

51:09.800 --> 51:12.800
And the Maxim 2006 calendar.

51:12.800 --> 51:16.340
These are actually for your backdrops.

51:16.340 --> 51:19.200
You can add them into your themes and stuff.

51:19.200 --> 51:21.200
It's great.

51:21.200 --> 51:24.840
Anything for the folks who would prefer to have a dude in the background?

51:24.840 --> 51:28.960
Well, this actually, this website does have a lot of other backgrounds and stuff, but

51:28.960 --> 51:31.720
I'm sure there's dude stuff out there.

51:31.720 --> 51:33.680
I'm just not looking for that.

51:33.680 --> 51:34.680
Anyway.

51:34.680 --> 51:37.280
I know, but we need to be, you know, equal opportunity.

51:37.280 --> 51:38.280
I know.

51:38.280 --> 51:40.840
DarkSopha's sitting over here going, I don't care about an ITHM booty.

51:40.840 --> 51:46.400
Now something a little bit more time sensitive here.

51:46.400 --> 51:53.960
On Monday the 19th, Nintendo of America's Executive Vice President of Sales and Marketing,

51:53.960 --> 52:06.680
Reggie Philz, at 4 o'clock to 5.30 Pacific Time, you can actually get a chance to play

52:06.680 --> 52:09.840
him at Mario Kart DS.

52:09.840 --> 52:18.180
If you get lucky and at 4pm pacific time start hammering the worldwide mode on your wifi

52:18.180 --> 52:26.180
and you might get lucky to go against NOA reggie.

52:26.180 --> 52:28.980
How many fake NOA reggies are going to be logged in though I wonder?

52:28.980 --> 52:33.700
Probably because they don't let you, I don't know.

52:33.700 --> 52:38.300
Although if you happen to live near Bellevue Washington, he will be at the Bellevue Square

52:38.300 --> 52:44.020
McDonald's at that time you can actually meet them there and get some Nintendo swag as well.

52:44.020 --> 52:48.360
Which just goes to show executives dine on McDonald's once in a while too.

52:48.360 --> 52:53.900
They have to get down and dirty with the rest of us and get their 99 cent menus and stuff.

52:53.900 --> 52:54.900
Exactly.

52:54.900 --> 52:58.920
So I think that's pretty cool that they're, you know, doing that kind of stuff.

52:58.920 --> 53:01.500
So good luck people.

53:01.500 --> 53:05.160
I know a lot of the snakers out there would like to go up against him.

53:05.160 --> 53:06.160
Yeah.

53:06.160 --> 53:07.500
Expose all the bugs in the game please.

53:07.500 --> 53:11.580
this guy is really good at Mario Kart, so it should be interesting.

53:11.580 --> 53:15.100
We'll see. I know you had one other quick thing. I want you to make sure you get all

53:15.100 --> 53:18.860
of your stories out. The thing about the Game Boy, the old-ass Game Boy...

53:18.860 --> 53:22.920
That's all speculation and rumors, so I'm not going to really go into it. Basically,

53:22.920 --> 53:26.540
the whole story was about the system that they're saying is going to be called Game

53:26.540 --> 53:31.140
Boy Evolution, and how it's supposed to come out later, and it's supposed to rival the

53:31.140 --> 53:36.720
PSP, yada yada yada. This is stuff that's been in development since 2004, and since

53:36.720 --> 53:41.040
there's no actual information on it, it's all speculation, I'm not even going to cover

53:41.040 --> 53:42.040
it.

53:42.040 --> 53:43.040
Interesting.

53:43.040 --> 53:48.760
I have a story here that talks about the biggest blockbusters of 2005 and it kind of coordinates

53:48.760 --> 53:52.080
with another story that you've probably seen around the internet talking about video game

53:52.080 --> 53:58.760
sales have fallen 18% this year and of course they're blaming that on no big blockbuster

53:58.760 --> 54:02.280
titles this year, we did not have a Halo 2 this year, we did not have a Grand Theft Auto

54:02.280 --> 54:05.760
San Andreas this year so saying that because of this you know even with the

54:05.760 --> 54:07.640
Xbox 360 well heck

54:07.640 --> 54:11.080
you know not everybody who wanted to buy an Xbox 360 could get one so

54:11.080 --> 54:14.240
video game sales on the whole have fallen a little bit this kinda doesn't

54:14.240 --> 54:17.840
surprise me though honestly because we're sitting on the cusp of the next

54:17.840 --> 54:19.120
gaming generation

54:19.120 --> 54:22.440
this should be natural for the game sales to fall right? I don't know why this is such a

54:22.440 --> 54:23.040
shock

54:23.040 --> 54:26.300
but what's interesting I thought what the interesting

54:26.300 --> 54:27.600
the top

54:27.600 --> 54:31.440
excuse me the top ten selling games of 2005 through November

54:31.440 --> 54:35.540
Only three of them actually released in 2005.

54:35.540 --> 54:40.180
Madden, Madden Football, Gran Turismo 4, Pokemon Emerald

54:40.180 --> 54:42.220
were the only games released in 2005

54:42.220 --> 54:44.380
to make the top 10 list, and hell,

54:44.380 --> 54:48.460
even Halo released in 2001 on the original Xbox

54:48.460 --> 54:51.300
thanks to price cuts and things, number nine on the list.

54:52.180 --> 54:53.020
Crazy, huh?

54:53.020 --> 54:54.260
They're saying also part of the reason

54:54.260 --> 54:56.980
this is, you know, the sales figures

54:56.980 --> 54:58.060
are not what they should be,

54:58.060 --> 55:01.140
most of the hugely anticipated games for 2005

55:01.140 --> 55:08.140
bumped to 2006. Kingdom Hearts 2, Final Fantasy 12, Zelda Twilight Princess, you know, everything

55:08.580 --> 55:10.580
got bumped, so what's left?

55:10.580 --> 55:17.020
Exactly, and the other thing that's interesting to note is on the Xbox 360 they're live, number

55:17.020 --> 55:19.380
one game on their Halo 2.

55:19.380 --> 55:24.660
Interesting. Alright, now we're going to end tonight's show, but we're going to talk about

55:24.660 --> 55:29.880
some sexy things to end tonight's show, some sexy things for your Christmas season. Dark

55:29.880 --> 55:35.800
soccer, you got a sexy MMO? There's a porn company called Naughty America

55:35.800 --> 55:39.640
that's going to be releasing an MMO. Is this actually an American company or is

55:39.640 --> 55:45.880
this like a... I have no idea. Okay. Sorry, it's called Naughty America. How naughty?

55:45.880 --> 55:56.480
It's going to be basically online chat, real-world communication. Webcams? Yes,

55:56.480 --> 56:02.380
Actually, you choose your fantasy persona to select your body type skin bla bla bla. Yahoo messengers got some competition

56:03.760 --> 56:06.560
You can also though change your appearance by going to

56:07.440 --> 56:10.400
clothing stores hair salon tattoo parlor plastic surgeon

56:11.000 --> 56:17.520
Didn't Yahoo messenger just roll out the avatar thing where you can do the hair salon and everything. There's some interesting correlations here

56:18.260 --> 56:23.400
But you've got to get it different areas. You have like downtown with your sex shops and video

56:23.400 --> 56:28.440
Does yahoo messenger have the sex shops? No it doesn't. Uptown you've got outdoor

56:28.440 --> 56:33.720
cafes, casino, beach has boardwalks, swimming, poolside bars, cruise trips.

56:33.720 --> 56:38.220
Wasn't this just what Sims Online turned into? I have no idea. I heard some story a

56:38.220 --> 56:40.800
while back that Sims Online, because remember the Sims Online was supposed to be this

56:40.800 --> 56:44.160
huge thing, well just like the real world the Sims Online got corrupted by porn

56:44.160 --> 56:49.080
and casino and all that stuff and now it's just like... But this one actually has

56:49.080 --> 56:56.320
sex mode where you can invite another player on a date and engage in

56:56.320 --> 57:05.820
interpersonal activity. Some hot coffee. Wasn't there a game that we saw over by the folks that did

57:05.820 --> 57:13.520
Extango? Yeah, Feel 3. Thank you, that's a game. Where you actually broke the demo and had them...

57:13.520 --> 57:18.360
Yeah, you actually got...Loki did so good on the demo somebody actually had a

57:18.360 --> 57:22.220
come by and put their hand up on the monitor because this person was starting

57:22.220 --> 57:26.700
to show too much I think I got a picture that it should be up on our e3 I know

57:26.700 --> 57:34.200
it's somewhere in the gallery I think it was the last day I remember that I

57:34.200 --> 57:39.660
should have taken that as my cue to start clicking like hell that was

57:39.660 --> 57:45.900
hilarious didn't one of us ask him if there would be dude on dude action yeah

57:45.900 --> 57:49.120
I think you or me asked about that one man woman

57:49.700 --> 57:56.300
We asked about that like could the game go there and they told us no one or they didn't understand. I don't think we were

57:57.460 --> 57:59.460
Can you be gay in this game?

58:00.420 --> 58:02.420
Cowboys, can you both?

58:02.420 --> 58:04.420
He said boy play woman

58:04.420 --> 58:07.940
Singles. I remember that now, that's right.

58:07.940 --> 58:13.420
Because we did ask him to play a woman.

58:13.420 --> 58:17.700
That was the funny thing. We killed Rob.

58:17.700 --> 58:22.780
Sorry, just good times, good memories. Anything else you want to share about the naughty

58:22.780 --> 58:28.780
America? I will play it. No, I will not play. You will too, if it's free, you're going to check it out.

58:28.780 --> 58:32.540
It's your assignment for the show, is you must check out Naughty America.

58:32.540 --> 58:34.540
I delegate my assignment to Loki.

58:34.540 --> 58:40.040
The only thing that this does not have, that Feel 3 does, is USB accessories to go with it.

58:40.040 --> 58:43.540
Yeah, Feel 3 had attachments.

58:43.540 --> 58:46.040
Like the rez vibrator? The trance vibrator?

58:46.040 --> 58:48.540
Yeah, but this thing wasn't a trance.

58:48.540 --> 58:51.040
I'm still looking for one of those, by the way.

58:51.040 --> 58:52.040
I finally found a copy of rez.

58:52.040 --> 58:53.040
Okay, TMI, honey.

58:53.040 --> 58:55.040
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

58:55.540 --> 59:01.040
Just to see if it's really as awful as they say it is, and I'm not going to use it for that, you perv.

59:01.040 --> 59:06.320
I have I have a sexy story. I don't actually I don't know if this is sexy or not, but

59:07.320 --> 59:08.560
Craigslist

59:08.560 --> 59:12.640
Which should say it all right there if you want to see some real nasty stuff

59:13.040 --> 59:17.800
Craigslist is the place for you to be just check out some of the personals on there not that I know firsthand or anything however

59:18.280 --> 59:25.520
There were some posts on Craigslist in the Boston area. There was a young woman there that was willing to trade sex

59:25.520 --> 59:33.640
Sex for an Xbox 360. She also was describing a female talking about a little menage a twa action

59:33.640 --> 59:35.640
If you don't know what I mean by that

59:37.080 --> 59:39.080
No, don't

59:39.440 --> 59:44.920
It has to be a premium bundle these guys only want premium bundles

59:46.440 --> 59:48.440
For their sexual encounter

59:49.320 --> 59:53.760
However, the post was removed just to see you guys know the post was removed from Craigslist

59:53.760 --> 59:59.840
But not before millions of nerds on the internet had a good laugh at it. So the post was removed because she was a sea donkey

01:00:04.320 --> 01:00:10.600
And apparently some some journalists actually some gaming journalists actually tried to write the person an email to see if this person was serious

01:00:10.600 --> 01:00:14.300
And maybe that's why I got removed. I have no idea. But anyway

01:00:16.480 --> 01:00:21.400
Some people are willing to go to great lengths to get that Xbox 360 before Christmas dark soccer

01:00:21.400 --> 01:00:23.200
You're pointing at something and going. Oh my god. Oh my god

01:00:23.200 --> 01:00:28.760
I as I typically do check VG cats, which is one of my favorite web comics

01:00:29.080 --> 01:00:31.920
It's all Animal Crossing and everybody needs to look at today's

01:00:32.440 --> 01:00:38.220
You talk about Animal Crossing too much on this show Dark Sakura. Oh, no, I'm taking that game away from you. All right

01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:41.000
We've got a wrap up. We got a wrap up

01:00:41.800 --> 01:00:46.300
We got to go around and get everybody's final thought so we can call it a night Loki your final thought

01:00:46.900 --> 01:00:48.360
I'm tired

01:00:48.360 --> 01:00:54.980
Dark soccer your final thought reject false icons and get rid of the plague for me. My final thought is boy play woman

01:00:57.340 --> 01:01:01.220
We'll see you next week. Yes, we are gonna do a show next week, even though it's Christmas

01:01:01.220 --> 01:01:03.220
We're gonna find some time to pre record a show

01:01:03.220 --> 01:01:09.260
Maybe talk about some of the years at least our favorite for the year and all sorts of other year-end things you would come to

01:01:09.260 --> 01:01:13.420
Expect thank you as always for giving a crap and listening to our show

01:01:13.420 --> 01:01:18.140
We really appreciate it, especially when you know, we're indie and all that stuff. We really appreciate it

01:01:18.140 --> 01:01:22.780
I want to give a shout out real quick to our buddies over at game politics.com

01:01:22.780 --> 01:01:25.820
because we kind of dropped the ball on something we said we were gonna do for

01:01:25.820 --> 01:01:29.340
and we kind of weren't able to do it because of the plague so we want to say

01:01:29.340 --> 01:01:33.620
hi and sorry and go visit game politics because they're a great site. Happy

01:01:33.620 --> 01:01:38.300
