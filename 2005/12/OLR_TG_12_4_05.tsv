149	1370	Hello everybody out there in podcasting land.
23103	24584	or whatever your hometown happens to be.
24604	26845	Do you think there's actually a town out there named Podcasting Land?
26865	27206	Probably not.
27306	29427	Well, there's Dish, Texas, so why not?
29727	30007	Why not?
30728	31888	I'd move to Podcasting Land.
32669	35270	You're listening to Orange Lounge Radio To Go.
35511	36431	My name is Rob Roberts.
36451	37532	You might know me as Sky.
38112	41194	Joining me as always, the one and only Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers.
41594	41914	Hi.
42235	42555	How are you?
43937	44718	I still have the plague.
45178	45979	But you sound better.
46039	48642	Have you had lots of liquid Vicodin and codeine and all that good stuff?
49082	50644	I drank codeine before the three hour show.
50904	51204	Awesome.
51865	54968	And I get to go home to sleep with Prince Vicodin.
55788	57189	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
78487	84137	But sometimes we do have to talk about a couple games that do suck, or has been the trend lately, movies based on games that kind of suck.
84738	85619	Such as BloodRayne.
85639	86621	Seen the trailer for BloodRayne?
86701	87522	I'm actually going to see it.
87983	88304	Why?
88644	88965	Why?
89045	90487	That's like $10 wasted.
90547	91950	Because there's pretty men in it.
92847	94968	There's also pretty prostitutes that are naked.
95788	96688	I'm Candy!
96828	99709	You are both being vapid and superficial.
100089	108212	Listen, I have to watch Alone in the Dark and I also have to watch House of the Dead before I see BloodRayne because I have to understand what I'm getting myself into.
108232	110833	You have to complete the poop trilogy is what you have to do.
110873	111874	House of the Dead was funny.
112354	113014	And awful.
113806	114366	and what was it?
114427	120491	In the name of the king, a dungeon siege movie blows ass is what the trailer sucked.
121091	122952	Burt Reynolds looks really bored.
124293	124873	Well, anyway.
125034	126014	Probably weren't paying him enough.
126294	135220	Before we got into that topic, we're supposed to talk about what kind of games we've been playing this week because that's how we start off the show, a little bit of a personal touch because, damn, we're important.
135661	136681	Or at least we'd like to think we are.
136721	139123	DarkSakura, who is most important.
140919	141960	What have you been playing this week?
141980	144262	What kind of games have you been playing this week?
165492	166513	Well, like, that's hard.
168194	176819	I've been really not playing much of anything because I've had the plague again all week, which is fun, but in a not really sort of way.
177359	182442	However, for my husband's birthday, which was Tuesday, we got him an Xbox 360.
182482	182722	Oh, right on.
185184	188427	We've had days filled with Perfect Dark Zero, which is gorgeous.
189627	191969	The new Ridge Racer is really, really nice.
193930	195932	He's also been really into Project Gotham.
198073	205959	Although for some reason he was playing Liberty City Grand Theft Auto on the PSP today.
205979	207240	I heard it's a decent game, you know.
208541	216245	Also, I got to see, actually, the new Madden game, which was nice, if you like Madden.
216605	219486	Yeah, I'm not a big sports game fan, but the game looked pretty.
219807	220227	But you know what?
220367	223028	If I want to play football, give me some Tecmo Bowl.
223689	225249	The new NBA 2006?
225309	227471	That actually looks kind of fun.
229004	232106	You know, the most sports games I've enjoyed have been basketball.
232166	233327	I mean, there's NBA Jam.
233627	234988	Loved NBA Jam back in the day.
235008	235608	Double Dribble.
235628	236268	NBA Jam was great.
237009	239370	You know, of course, these are all like 15-year-old games.
240010	242051	Yeah, NBA Jam was a good game.
242412	245673	Thanks to EA, you can never have another NBA Jam.
245793	246034	Well...
246934	249115	They can go to hell.
249335	254176	But I do have to say that Mike Bibby did not look like himself in that game.
254216	256196	That was a very bad version of him.
256657	261358	However, Art Corvino looked very nice, because of course the first game Dan did was Lakers vs. Kings.
261578	263498	Of course, as most people in this area would do.
264659	264999	Whatever.
266500	272545	I did play some more Katamari just because and of course it made me uber motion sick because I've been sick anyway.
274427	276969	I turned on World of Warcraft again and then promptly left the room.
278550	279071	Why is that?
279891	280712	I forgot about it.
280772	282013	I had to do something and I came back.
282093	283094	Oh, World of Warcraft.
283134	283835	Something shiny.
284938	286139	That's my shiny thing.
287139	295382	And I just haven't had... You know, I've also had to go back to school and work and... Well, Animal Crossing this week.
295402	296383	Are you going to make some time for it?
296403	297923	I know you're doing Animal Crossing.
297943	298223	Oh, hell yeah.
298263	300564	My breaks are no longer going to be spent on my book.
301184	302825	They're going to be spent on playing Animal Crossing.
302845	303945	There you go.
304526	307487	Me, you, bike racks, 3 o'clock, bring your bug net.
307507	308387	That's all I have to say.
308847	309428	Oh, hell yeah.
309648	310008	It's on.
310148	312329	Just wait until I put some signs in your village.
314480	316422	Alright, Loki, what's on your mind?
317462	320405	As far as games goes, I don't care about what else is on your mind, I just want to know games.
320605	328030	Well, I've been playing Grand Theft Auto Liberty City Stories, the usual by workday game that we play.
328751	331513	I've been kicking the crap out of everybody because I fucking rock.
332253	338318	And then also I've been playing Matrix Path of Neo, and that was pretty cool.
338478	339519	It's actually a lot...
340194	340394	and so on.
361059	371083	This is a pretty well done game, and I like how you can select your difficulty in the beginning, how it just gets progressively harder, and then you select it off of that.
372383	374604	I don't like the fact that the cameras are really slow.
375024	381586	Like, you change the camera around, it moves too slow, and I can't get it to go faster, and so I get a lot of awkward camera shots with that.
381987	383927	I don't know, it's pretty good, and then it gets really hard.
384768	385628	Really hard, really fast.
385648	385768	Like,
386203	387844	I think I saw a story over on Dig or something about that game.
387864	388864	What's this all about?
388904	390605	It's a free game that's put out.
390645	392446	You can go to the website www.cloudthegame.com
415820	419262	And it's supposedly a game that's supposed to make you cry, I guess.
420163	421744	Wait, this game's going to make me cry?
421924	422685	Supposedly.
423045	423325	Why?
423345	430069	I guess because the content, I think it talks about some kids... Is it going to chop onions live in front of me?
430289	437054	Or is it going to show me hideous images from the things in our history and stuff?
437094	438635	Going to play Politary on repeat.
440716	441317	Let's see here.
441577	445119	And actually, maybe it isn't cloudthegame.com, but I have the link right here.
446092	447493	It's a pretty fun game.
448094	451276	Definitely worth checking it out, especially since it's a free download.
451296	452536	You can't really go wrong with that.
454898	458540	But yeah, it's actually thatcloudgame.com.
458680	459661	Thatcloudgame.
460341	462063	Not to be confused with Final Fantasy VII Cloud.
462343	466946	It's created by the Game Innovation Group.
467825	476658	Um, students from Game Innovation who created, and it's a division of Interactive Media at University of Southern California School of Cinema and Television.
477460	478601	Um, and it's actually...
479571	480652	Pretty awesome.
480672	483654	They've got a little FAQ here about it.
483834	485795	And it's just, it's a really well done game.
485815	486275	It's kind of fun.
486555	489857	It's kind of like Katamari and it's more of a puzzle game.
489977	491478	It's free and it's pretty.
491518	492339	What else do you need to know?
492379	493200	It's relaxing.
493280	496001	It's not, there's not really any time limits or anything.
496061	505187	It's just kind of, you build clouds, you start off, you gather clouds and you can kind of suck them up and then you can kind of spit them back out again.
505846	510810	and create, like, taller clouds to pick up even bigger clouds and then you can make stuff rain and stuff like that.
510830	512432	Okay, I'm still not driven to tears here.
513272	519558	Well, I don't know what it is, but, um, it's just, it's a cool game, so thatcloudgame.com, go check it out.
519578	522780	If you have cried playing Cloud the Game, I seriously want to hear from you.
522800	524422	2go at orangelandradio.com.
524482	527044	I seriously want to know what's so freaking sad about this game.
527064	527985	I don't know, it's...
528325	538948	It's kind of got the sad music into it, and it's got, like, in the very beginning, it's talking about this kid who stopped taking his meds, and so you kind of get the feeling maybe he's dead or something like that.
539148	540409	Okay, that's kind of sad.
540749	544870	Most gamers have cold black hearts after playing Doom 3 for hours on end, you know, so what?
545511	545931	I don't know.
546891	548311	But it's well done.
548351	549492	The art's really good in it.
549992	553673	It runs on almost, you know, most PCs nowadays.
553713	556134	It doesn't require, like, a huge graphics card or anything, so...
557185	558166	I would definitely check it out.
570916	572557	Thank you for watching!
593268	597550	But there are some of the games I want to check out that are coming out, including Animal Crossing this week.
597930	604173	Final Fantasy 4 Advance, which I believe is this week or was last week.
604193	604954	I think it's this week.
605034	606214	Yeah, it's very, very soon.
606254	606634	I know that.
607115	611577	And that's pretty much all that's on my must-play list between now and Christmas.
612117	615419	Otherwise, I'll just kind of check things out as I play them or come across them.
615499	616039	They look cool.
616620	620662	Otherwise, for me, honestly, it's been a lot of Dragon Quest VIII, which I talked about last week already.
621542	622002	Great game.
622222	622803	I'm loving it.
622863	628406	It's an old-style RPG, and it's what I remember from the great Super Nintendo.
628446	630767	It kind of is a throwback to the Super Nintendo RPGs.
631207	632167	It's holding my attention.
632768	633848	And that's pretty much it.
633908	637610	I've got just a lot of stuff going on in my personal life, so I can't do a lot of games this week.
637630	640292	But next week, for sure, Animal Crossing and probably Final Fantasy.
640492	642072	I will definitely be all up on that.
643513	644854	Let's get into some gaming news, shall we?
646412	654215	Speaking of things that are like 15 years old, I know this is an odd thing to lead off as a top story, but damn, this was so weird.
654295	659257	Loki, you've got to tell me about what you saw in this message form about a chip that's very old.
659737	660697	What is going on with this?
662118	669741	Well, at Benhek.com, because you've got to love that stuff, they were talking about how they've overclocked the Super FX chip.
670001	673182	And for those who might not remember, that's the chip that was in
673615	678257	Those wonderful 3D games, you know, back in Star Fox and Stunt Race FX.
678297	678997	Off-road, yeah.
679097	679357	Oh, no.
680738	682118	There was an off-road game that had it, too.
682178	683299	I think there was another driving game.
683739	684599	I don't remember.
684719	688300	Yeah, Stunt Race FX was that stupid, stupid, stupid game.
688320	689301	Maybe I'm getting it confused.
689641	692122	Anyways, a bunch of other stuff.
692562	699185	And what they've done is there's a timing chip that's on this actual, you know, rip the card apart and actually look at the circuit board.
699565	702286	And what they've done is replace that with a different chip.
702666	702806	And...
703797	721876	What that has done is actually now things are moving faster, it's less lag, so when they get to a scene with lots of enemies in the background, it does not slow down, just better frame rate and stuff, which is kind of neat, because you've got to love everybody hacking stuff.
722759	723200	I don't know.
723240	729266	This is weird that this is so old, yet people are still messing with this stuff.
729366	733750	This is kind of neat, diehard fan stuff.
734231	737474	If I wasn't afraid, I would screw up my Super Nintendo.
737534	739456	Honestly, I don't even have a working Super Nintendo anymore.
739496	743440	If I wasn't afraid, I would screw up a valuable Star Fox cartridge by doing this.
743600	744561	It almost sounds like fun.
745953	749454	Well, except that you can find them for $2 at the thrift store.
749854	751454	I thought they were worth more than that.
751854	752195	Well, crap.
752215	754815	They are, but if you look at the thrift store, they'll sell... Really?
755035	759116	Well, you know, I see copies of, what was it, Casey Munchkin?
759596	759856	Uh-huh.
760356	763537	On some of those auctions selling for a little bit more.
763557	763857	Yeah.
764277	768018	I bought my copies, several of them, for $0.99 at the thrift store.
768058	769959	Oh, yeah, because they don't know the real value of that stuff.
769979	770479	Exactly.
770659	773100	Yeah, and people who just donate bags and bags.
773520	773960	Interesting.
775464	780707	Alright, let's talk about some news going on with Final Fantasy XII, DarkSakura.
780727	782709	What do you know about what's going on with the release in Japan?
783469	785791	Well, I know they're planning on charging a bit more for it.
786631	793135	Typically, PS2 games retail for about 7,410 yen.
794776	799059	However, they're saying that the launch price is going to be 8,990 yen.
801588	801829	Ouch.
802069	805493	Which is about, yeah, 85, 86 bucks.
805774	806335	Wow.
806495	809138	But games are typically more expensive in Japan anyway, right?
809259	810440	That's not a big deal.
810460	813684	Yeah, but... But if you're going to import this, you're going to be paying that.
813945	816188	They're popping the price up on that one.
816528	816849	Wow.
816909	818731	Just for conversion's sake, that's about 43 pounds.
820111	820512	Amazing.
820872	824095	Now, do you think that's going to have an effect on the release here?
824135	828739	Do you think that we're going to end up paying a real high-end price such as $59.99 for this?
828920	835186	Well, Squinnix hasn't commented on anything, but I'm thinking it's probably going to be a likelihood.
835766	837388	At least bank on $49.99 if nothing else.
839013	839533	DarkSakura.com
859568	860709	Now did you hear about this?
861449	871397	When they release this in Japan on March 16th, actually Squeenix teamed up with somebody called Suntory who makes these drinks, these basically herbal drinks.
871717	874519	They're going to release Final Fantasy XII Potion.
874959	878582	They're these blue crystal drink looking things that are basically...
878982	886445	Like, you know the power drinks we have here in America, the Buku and the Rockstar and Red Bull being probably the most popular of them all.
887585	895548	It's basically something like that, except they say this will be a mysterious flavor, the potion, and will be made from various herbs.
895588	900930	And of course they're going to do all these lame tie-ins about, you know, it'll regenerate your HP with all the herbal goodness.
901350	902230	Wah, wah, wah.
902310	902871	Stuff like that.
903311	905412	I don't know, you think that's something that could work over here?
905632	906532	Final Fantasy Potion?
907665	915311	Well, looking at the ingredients in it though, hyssop and lemon balm, they are, okay, I worked at GNC for a very long time and an herb shop.
915611	918534	Yeah, those are fairly sedative herbs.
918814	923738	I'd have to see the ingredient list, the full list, but I would buy it.
924098	927241	You know, instead of having an energy drink, why not have a drink that relaxes you?
927731	929592	I think it's a good idea.
929912	932253	Although I don't think I need my HP to go up anymore.
932273	935234	Even though I have the plague.
935334	938055	This will be the rage at anime conventions.
938335	938895	Seriously.
939315	948579	The kid who imports a case of this, if they don't end up releasing it here, a kid who imports the case of this will be the most loved at the anime conventions.
949540	950161	I got my potion.
950201	953085	It had the thing about the premium box bundle, right?
953345	958211	With the specially designed bottle and the Final Fantasy XII art museum card.
959588	959948	Very cool.
960429	961169	Loki, what do you think?
961529	961929	Potion?
962190	962570	Good thing?
962590	962850	Bad thing?
962910	963470	I'm not buying it.
963510	965512	I don't buy those energy drinks anyway.
965872	966912	It's not an energy drink.
966952	967733	It's a calming drink.
967873	968513	Well, whatever.
968533	969774	I still buy that stuff.
969874	971575	If it's got herbs in it, forget it.
971996	974217	When they release a drink called Ether, wake me up.
976678	977319	Moving on.
977379	978159	Other stories.
978760	981461	What's going on with WoW?
981962	985204	We were talking about hacking the Super FX.
985244	987325	What's being hacked in World of Warcraft, Jamie?
988140	991608	Well we have SUPER HOT XXX NUDE ORCS!
993809	1005115	Yeah, someone basically hacked it to have all the female characters, orcs, humans, gnomes, night elves, dwarves, trolls, undead, whatever, get naked.
1006155	1012559	But Blizzard's probably going to be, of course, cracking down on that one, so the only way you can get it would probably be on a private server.
1012779	1014580	You knew this shit would happen eventually.
1014600	1016221	It's because people are perverts.
1016301	1020483	Release a video game for the computer with a woman in it, and somebody will get her naked.
1020983	1021403	Troll boobies!
1021423	1022624	There's nothing they can do.
1023902	1024744	There's nothing they can do.
1024764	1027873	Well, especially when WoW is so patch-friendly anyway.
1027933	1030821	I mean, mine is bogged down with all these patches like the Oct...
1032938	1039444	that show you how long estimated to get to your next level and just all this crap on there that makes the game take forever to load.
1039724	1048853	But since Blizzard is so friendly at supporting this stuff, whereas other games, Final Fantasy XI, do not support these things, it kind of makes it easier for these types of patches to go into effect.
1048873	1053797	People have been modding Final Fantasy XI to do this already.
1054218	1055038	It's not a surprise.
1055078	1055859	I'm just saying.
1056259	1058742	Blizzard kind of embracing it makes it...
1059523	1059883	Smash Bros.
1080236	1081937	The creator of the Smash Bros.
1081978	1098312	series has said in the latest issue of the Japanese Game Bible Famitsu, what's going to happen is that Mashihiro Sakurai is actually coming back to Nintendo after being gone for two years, saying that he will be doing a new Super Smash Bros.
1098352	1101995	game for the Revolution, to which many Nintendo fanboys are cheering.
1102695	1105658	I think this was kind of a given that there would definitely have to be some type of Smash Bros.
1105698	1106359	on Revolution.
1106959	1107439	One word...
1108380	1111362	Pit from, actually no, there's four words, Pit from Kid Icarus.
1111382	1112303	Okay, thanks.
1112503	1113104	We need Pit.
1113704	1114164	Absolutely.
1114325	1115045	Or Eggplant Wizard.
1115105	1116926	Yeah, I was going to say we need Eggplant Wizard.
1116946	1118187	We know who we need, actually.
1118708	1120369	We need us a Mega Man.
1121410	1123011	But that's not Nintendo, that's Capcom.
1123031	1123992	That's true, that's Capcom.
1124732	1126714	Well, then we need somebody to make friends at Capcom.
1127694	1135140	I don't know why, well, I was just, I had it in my head, though, thinking, it was another character I'm trying to think of that was, I don't know, what if we have Nintendogs?
1137642	1138583	They come out as helpers.
1138603	1141325	Dalmatians start ripping Mario flesh.
1141605	1142125	Oh, God.
1142625	1143026	All right.
1144367	1145587	Oh, no, ammonia burn.
1146788	1147769	Or Animal Crossing.
1147989	1148349	K.K.
1148389	1150131	Slider comes and whacks you with his guitar.
1151251	1152212	We need Rob the Robot.
1153215	1154977	One of the weapons you get is a power glove.
1177620	1178961	Lame, lame, lame.
1179201	1179781	No way.
1180462	1183404	Let's talk about some games that are coming out like within this.
1183484	1183984	Oh, actually, no.
1184044	1188807	Before we get to that, Nintendo in the UK is doing something kind of interesting.
1190638	1193159	Well, there are downloadable ringtones available.
1193279	1197420	That is if you are a member of their little club thing.
1197440	1199981	They have the Nintendo VIP 24-7 Club.
1200641	1210765	You'll be able to, after December 5th, you will be able to turn in your stars that you've collected to buy ringtones from the Nintendo of Europe website.
1212111	1213832	They said they've got 20 to choose from.
1213892	1218296	There's The Legend of Zelda, Metroid Prime, Super Mario Bros.
1220118	1223161	They say there are 350 stars each.
1224222	1228085	But there's also mobile wallpapers too at 150 stars apiece.
1229907	1231108	They're saying though that you...
1233143	1238585	Have to update your user profile by entering in your mobile number, your phone's makeup model.
1239265	1240505	You basically follow the instructions.
1241105	1252329	Kind of similar to what they do on the US side because I actually finally signed up for the US Nintendo thing because, you know, with the new console coming out and the DS Wi-Fi, I kind of wanted to get on board with whatever promotional things they might be doing.
1252369	1256970	So I went and I pulled all my DS games and I registered them all with Nintendo's site.
1257030	1258551	So hopefully I'll get some free crap.
1258731	1258991	I don't know.
1259011	1259231	We'll see.
1260154	1268780	Yeah, I remember when I did that, you know, back in the day when they were giving away that Zelda, you know, where it's the Zelda 1 and 2 and then... You didn't get shit, did you?
1268840	1269680	No, I didn't get shit.
1270100	1274483	And I qualified for it, and they said they were going to send it, and they didn't send it, so... Aw, maybe somebody stole it.
1274503	1276224	Maybe I stole it, because you were living with me at the time.
1276244	1276304	No.
1276365	1277005	All right.
1278266	1283869	Well, they're also, though, they've just launched a new WAP portal for your mobile.
1284930	1286611	You go to wap.nintendo.co.uk.
1288581	1289662	Saken Densetsu DS
1303820	1306461	Estimated $42 when you convert the dollars over there.
1307302	1314805	No stateside release announced yet, but honestly guys, I think it's pretty much a given that this game will be making its way over here.
1315425	1318426	I would guess maybe next summer, next Christmas, I think is a fair guess.
1318907	1319247	Who knows?
1319427	1321428	It's all up to Squeenix on whatever they want to do.
1322108	1326870	But for those of you guys who like to import, you can do that on February 23rd, this latest entry from Japan.
1328187	1333311	Loki, you have something that a lot of gamers might want on their wish list this Christmas.
1333371	1337853	If you got about, what, $800, $1,000 to spare to get arcade games in your home, what's this about?
1337893	1338594	Less than that.
1338754	1339034	Oh, wow.
1339154	1339515	Oh, good.
1339755	1343317	Yeah, first off, there's a couple places you can get arcade games.
1344318	1352843	One of them being at Costco, and they're selling kind of a better package, but it's for about, I think, $2,000.
1352903	1353644	You can get a full-size...
1357783	1359424	I'm sorry, $2,299.
1359744	1363367	You get a 2006 Ultimate Arcade stand-up unit.
1363407	1369691	Now, I'm not going to be confused with the Ultimate Arcade, you know, cabinet, which is something, like, I built for mine.
1369791	1376095	But anyways, it comes with 81 games, all from Atari and others, including Golden Tee and stuff.
1376796	1382579	It's covered in, like, different logos, like Capcom and stuff, which is kind of odd seeing as there's all Atari games in there, but...
1384525	1385546	Huge list of stuff.
1405123	1409825	Now, if you're not looking to spend $2,300 on something, Target has something more of your price.
1410645	1418828	Their cabinet, which sports a whopping 12 games, all from Midway, is $397, which is not bad for a game.
1418848	1423830	Yeah, considering that you could probably gut that thing and do something else with it, not a bad price.
1423990	1426330	Yeah, that's not a bad price if you want to gut it.
1426710	1433873	Now, granted, it is a little bit tiny, but it includes such wonderful things as Joust, Defender, 1-2, Robotron, Rampage,
1434741	1440425	Blatt, Satan's Hollow, Root Beer Tapper, Bubbles, Wizards of War, Timber, and Sinistar.
1440465	1442326	You know, hats off to Midway.
1442367	1443788	They know how to milk their old shit.
1443848	1444328	They really do.
1444408	1445429	Sinistar is awesome.
1445509	1447130	They know how to get the most out of their old stuff.
1447526	1449567	DarkSakura.com is the place to send those emails.
1449647	1452487	And we'll read them and respond to them when we feel like it.
1452567	1453928	No, just kidding.
1453948	1455428	DarkSakura always...
1476573	1476713	XBOX 360
1504096	1507877	A USB adapter.
1509197	1510357	Oh, the wireless thing.
1510618	1510798	Right.
1510858	1511558	I heard about this.
1512098	1514979	Kind of taken a good idea from the Nintendo DS, honestly.
1515059	1517979	But hey, hey, it works.
1519079	1522120	Apparently what you can do with this, you can hook up a USB hard drive to your 360.
1522160	1525501	Oh, interesting.
1525561	1525781	Okay.
1527832	1533517	Let's see, it says on the actually linked website, all you need is the following, a hard drive of your choice.
1535318	1539982	It says the drive is not important as long as you can get a USB 2.0 adapter for that type of drive.
1540363	1544766	And then a USB 2.0 to ATA adapter for the type of drive you will be using.
1544786	1548569	That's pretty neat stuff.
1548950	1550711	Interesting.
1551372	1555135	Also, in other email here, as soon as I get back to...
1555996	1557577	Reach my hand back in the bag.
1559318	1561219	A little bit about the... That's not the mailbag.
1563341	1564061	Dot, dot, dot.
1565202	1565542	Go ahead.
1565902	1568484	ESRB is up to their old crap again.
1569044	1569645	Yay.
1571225	1574548	Well, that's a good thing, though, because they've got to fend off all this other stuff going on, right?
1575108	1575468	In a way?
1575908	1576249	Kind of?
1576529	1576789	Maybe?
1578150	1579791	Well, they posted an article here.
1579811	1579891	Just...
1586454	1587935	ESRB Game Retailers Decried Bad Report Card
1612128	1624581	Ratings Education C+, Retailers Policies B, Retailers Enforcement D-, Ratings Accuracy F, Arcade Survey B-, and
1628598	1632341	The only reason they got that F in ratings accuracy is because that Grand Theft Auto thing slipped through.
1632421	1636664	And I still say to this day, Rockstar did not intend for that to get out.
1636745	1637986	It was a lazy programming thing.
1638146	1639267	It was a lazy programming thing.
1639287	1639907	It's a common programming thing.
1639927	1641068	That they never thought they would have to do.
1641088	1641148	Huh?
1642249	1645471	But there was just, you know, I love this comment here.
1645552	1650976	Parents exercising responsibility by not buying games intended for 17 year olds for their 10 year old.
1652157	1655580	F. Huh.
1655800	1656801	Definitely need to be on there.
1656981	1657221	You know.
1660320	1661341	I'm going to go ahead.
1662121	1665643	This article is actually on the Ars Technica website.
1667264	1671226	It really needs to be given a read by many of our listeners.
1672306	1675368	It's a pretty lengthy article.
1675388	1676388	It goes into a lot of details.
1676948	1686473	But I do think that it makes a pretty good point with the points going back and forth between the different facilities that are arguing about
1686980	1689881	You know, for the ratings or against the ratings or how effective they are.
1690842	1697545	You know, I honestly think that the ratings themselves are pretty accurate, I would say.
1698325	1701587	It's just the fact that parents just don't look.
1701827	1702387	They don't care.
1702887	1703307	Interesting.
1703587	1708690	You know, this is going to tie into a story I have coming up as soon as you're done with mail.
1708730	1708870	Okay.
1708910	1709190	Is that it?
1709230	1709770	Was that it for mail?
1710511	1710671	No.
1710991	1711111	No?
1711371	1711591	Okay.
1712131	1712391	No.
1712752	1712912	Okay.
1715255	1723878	There's also another one he linked about 400,000 Xbox 360s being sold.
1725318	1725678	What?
1725838	1726358	Really?
1728479	1730319	They have to be stacking those numbers.
1730379	1732060	Is that how many they really put out on shelves?
1732120	1732860	Is that maybe 400,000 worldwide?
1732880	1736341	No, they're estimating 400,000 launched in the US, 300,000 in the UK.
1741570	1741950	Wow.
1743211	1744913	I don't know, it just seems like nobody I know has one.
1745393	1754660	So, maybe a couple people online I know, but nobody I know has one, whereas everybody I know has PS2s, well, whatever, who cares.
1756081	1756722	It's just a launch.
1757422	1762346	And you know, this crap about them not having the systems, I'm sorry, that's so much utter crap.
1762887	1763227	How so?
1763848	1764268	Just because...
1766457	1775081	I don't know how fast they're manufacturing, or maybe it's because they're trying to manufacture them so quick is why they're such, you know, kind of bad quality.
1775541	1777302	You know, why so many of them are having issues.
1777462	1779183	Even, you know, my Xbox has issues.
1780343	1783505	It froze like three times while we were playing Ridge Racer 6.
1784885	1786806	This is why I'm glad I decided to wait a little bit.
1786846	1788567	Maybe they'll work some of this stuff out in 2006.
1789067	1789647	I don't know.
1789728	1792609	We're probably going to end up, I don't know, trading ours in...
1793706	1794126	DarkSakura.com
1822389	1824231	Yeah, I want to wait for actual numbers.
1824912	1827314	I don't buy this estimate thing.
1829076	1830318	Alright, anything else?
1831192	1835513	There were a few others, but we'll go ahead to whatever you had.
1852719	1856560	Talk about this bill that they are going to propose when Congress reconvenes in two weeks.
1856620	1863583	It's the Family Entertainment Protection Act, and it will pretty much be suggesting that we govern a few things.
1863743	1875207	Step one, basically that it's going to be trying to get businesses to not sell a mature adults-only or ratings-pending game to a person who's younger than 17.
1876027	1877888	First thing I should note is that this bill
1879102	1889909	contrary to the California bill that was passed under the bills, actually embraces the ESRB rating system and sort of uses that as the guide as to what they consider mature and what's not.
1890049	1902598	And for that, I kind of say I applaud this bill where other bills I think have kind of failed is that the other bills made it, at least the California one that I was pretty familiar with, made it way too vague what exactly a mature game is.
1903058	1905680	This makes the board do it, which I think is kind of interesting.
1906140	1908682	Step two calls for mandated yearly review.
1909363	1926321	Okay, step three, the FTC, Federal Trade Commission, can conduct an investigation when misconstances happen, as they will do with Grand Theft Auto, San Andreas, to see if it was done purposefully, which I do truly believe they will find it was not.
1926841	1927061	Okay.
1927962	1932304	Step four, consumers can file complaints with the Federal Trade Commission when they disagree.
1933325	1940548	And then the FTC would also be audited regularly to make sure that the ESRB is doing their job and everything.
1941229	1946191	I actually, although I do believe the bottom line is that
1947571	1948352	Thanks for watching.
1948372	1948892	See you next time.
1972892	1976995	Everything is running as it should be, and I don't think that's necessarily a bad thing.
1977075	1981138	So I'm not so much on the doom and gloom page as everybody else is on with this.
1981218	1987242	Although I do understand the argument that, you know what, why don't parents just frickin' read the labels?
1988022	1990844	I find it disgusting that we've had to come to this.
1992265	1998589	That, first of all, there's not as much honesty, I think, in the marketing of some of these games.
1999850	2000170	You know...
2002659	2005501	I don't think they're particularly hiding their content, you know?
2006661	2019489	But I also don't think that they are 100% accurate about the level of some of the things that are in some of the games and are hiding behind the rating system to see what they can eek past.
2020150	2021030	It's how movies do.
2021871	2024312	Well, true, true.
2024432	2028275	I think there should be consistency between games and movies, though, and I've said that a long time ago.
2028295	2029976	I think they should be using the same rating system.
2030934	2046266	But I think that if it is proven that the actions of a child are based directly off of an event in a video game, their parents need to be held liable for neglect, for being negligent in what their children are doing.
2047007	2053592	It is not the job of the government, nor is it the job of video game companies to decide what children play.
2054653	2058136	It is the job of the parent to censor what their children look at.
2059694	2080187	and where me myself you know I know when I have kids I'm gonna you know I basically got to look at whatever I wanted to when I was younger and I grew up fine and responsible because I grew up prepared for it that's how I feel I know that that's how I'm going to be with my children if they do something bad as a result of a game they don't get to play the game anymore
2080987	2081287	Demon Spawn!
2081368	2081688	Just kidding.
2099241	2118665	but um I think that I feel very strongly that it's the job of the parent to ultimately decide if their child's going to be allowed to have something and I think that if their child is going behind their back and getting these games or trading with their friends and parents need to say no you're going to give me that and we're taking it back
2120693	2124716	They need to, you know, and I know kids are going to hide stuff and try to get away with stuff.
2124836	2126738	You know, I was that way when I was a kid.
2127238	2131141	I don't know what child didn't try to get something past their parents at some point or another.
2131521	2136204	And parents, please do not lie to me and say that your children are perfect angels because we know what kids are like.
2136985	2138826	We were all kids once, right?
2139126	2140067	We were all there.
2140607	2148053	You know, no child is going to be perfectly well behaved and even if it looks like they're perfectly well behaved, you know damn well they're trying something behind your back.
2149133	2150494	It's the nature of being a kid.
2150794	2153395	You have to go through your rebellious phase and then you grow out of it.
2154395	2155056	Part of growing up.
2156096	2157397	But still, I digress.
2157417	2164660	I really do think that it, you know, and I know that not all parents are like this.
2164740	2170583	Not all of them are really irresponsible, but I have met plenty who are.
2172104	2177126	All the ones that you see on television who are like, my child, my mom, my dad, my mom.
2178454	2179835	It's their fault.
2180275	2184658	Seriously, go observe at a GameStop or an EB game sometime.
2184698	2189181	Just kind of lurk in the corner and kind of listen to some of the counter conversations between parents and kids.
2189662	2190542	It is amazing.
2190722	2192323	It is amazing some of the stuff you would hear.
2192684	2193204	I mean, it is.
2193684	2194165	Oh my gosh.
2194185	2194245	Wow.
2195625	2197727	I don't think enough parents take...
2198852	2201014	enough of an active role in their children's upbringing.
2201134	2203956	And I understand being busy.
2204737	2207139	I know right now I would not be in a position to have a child.
2207619	2211342	As long as I'm working full-time and going to school, I am damn not having a child.
2212083	2225574	And I think that there are too many parents out there who are not dedicating the time they need to make sure that their children are doing what they should be, playing the right kind of game.
2226195	2227636	They're letting the game to babysit their children.
2229079	2231101	Well, I'm sure we're going to get some emails on that.
2231282	2232643	I welcome them.
2232723	2234205	I really want to discuss it.
2234265	2236708	2go at orangeloungeradio.com is the email.
2237068	2238269	Loki, though, what's your thought?
2238289	2242073	I'm going to let my kids just... They're only going to be able to play Grand Theft Auto on that.
2242094	2242414	That's it.
2243421	2244642	You're doing like an experiment.
2244882	2245623	No, screw that.
2245683	2246684	There's no experiment.
2246764	2248105	Why do we need to do this anyways?
2248485	2250767	This is all Hillary Clinton's fault.
2250847	2251507	And you know why?
2252148	2252628	Yes, it is.
2252868	2253348	You know why?
2253428	2257511	Because she wants some sort of platform so she can campaign for fucking president.
2257531	2258132	That's what it is.
2258552	2259653	And I can tell you this much.
2259913	2260674	We don't need that.
2260714	2261454	Because why?
2262055	2267098	For one, we don't have any sort of laws saying that a child under 17...
2271362	2280631	I agree that if this is going to be against the law, then it should be against the law.
2281152	2286537	The theater should be held responsible when a kid sneaks into an R-rated film, which is something we all did when we were kids.
2286917	2288459	And besides, it's... Who snuck?
2288679	2289200	I just went.
2289900	2291162	It's going to be just, you know...
2291716	2292797	It's still going to be the same problem.
2292837	2295780	So what, you make it against the law for a kid to buy the game.
2295861	2296601	Okay, big deal.
2296862	2299084	The parents are buying the games for the kids anyway, so what's the matter?
2299184	2300606	I mean, you've solved nothing.
2302628	2310216	I honestly, though, have to say that I'm highly embarrassed to have Hillary Clinton as a representative of my gender.
2311437	2317381	Well, that's... I don't think it's as bad as people are making it out to be.
2317741	2320163	I think that... I kind of agree with what you're saying.
2320203	2325106	It's kind of sad that it's come to this, but I think that this bill is much better than bills in the past.
2325186	2326967	I think there's merit to this.
2327387	2333091	If they have to have one, then this one is more well thought out, I think.
2334251	2337514	And so I can't say that Hillary Clinton's a bitch because, you know, I think it's...
2338775	2348192	I give her credit for saying, okay, we have this ESRB, but the problem with it is it's regulated by the industry, so let's have the government regulate it, and then we could use this.
2348333	2350417	I think it's the best idea.
2351608	2353589	I'm sure I'll get an email or two on it.
2353609	2353889	I'm sure.
2353909	2357850	And have they solved the problems with pirates out there?
2358170	2358270	No.
2358910	2359331	Oh, that's right.
2359351	2363692	Maybe they should just focus on that and not on these two ratings.
2364972	2366033	Jack Sparrow is coming back.
2366073	2366853	Haven't you seen the trailer?
2367673	2369094	Yeah.
2369134	2369954	I'm hilarious.
2370894	2371975	But seriously, folks.
2372575	2373915	I would like to receive the email.
2373995	2379857	I would love to hear from other parents, especially just on a personal note since, again, like I said, I'm planning on spawning soon.
2380216	2380757	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2393471	2401919	There is a very high degree of responsibility with the companies for what they market, but I strongly believe still that the ultimate power is in the hands of the parents.
2402300	2408466	And I assure you this, I will be emailing Senator Clinton and Senator Lieberman's office trying to get an interview.
2408787	2414613	And it probably won't happen, but I will email and try and allow them to present their perspective on the show if they so choose.
2414833	2416834	And I'd like to voice my opinion to the industry.
2417134	2418234	We need more games with TNA.
2418294	2420135	Because there's a lot more violent games out there.
2420435	2421475	Not enough nudity.
2421635	2427637	Well, you know, maybe having a bunch of nudie games will be like stress relief instead of insight violence.
2427997	2432098	Well, here's an interesting footnote now to all of this we've been talking about.
2432558	2435760	Illinois passed one of these gaming laws not that long ago.
2436941	2437581	Overturned.
2438041	2439943	It was supposed to go into effect January 1st of 2006.
2440643	2444826	However, a district judge ruled that it would violate First Amendment.
2445266	2446787	And so the bill was stricken.
2447607	2448088	Interesting.
2448948	2451050	Wait, amendment, amendment, constitution.
2451070	2453551	Yeah, those are those things that our government continuously ignores.
2453771	2454752	Oh, that's right.
2454852	2455392	Constitution.
2455432	2456933	I remember the constitution.
2456953	2459034	We used to study that in elementary school.
2459475	2461156	But now they just teach it because they're forced to.
2462003	2462983	I thought this was interesting.
2463003	2464424	I have to say this.
2464484	2465564	You have to hear this, okay?
2465944	2468785	This was a 53-page ruling by Judge Kennelly.
2469165	2477428	He specifically talks about God of War and mentions a minigame where the character Kratos has sexual relations with two women.
2478409	2495962	Quote, Because of this one scene, a game such as God of War, which essentially parallels a classic book like The Odyssey, likely would be prohibited for minors under the SEVGL because the statute allows a game to be regulated based on one scene without regard to the value of the game as a whole.
2496462	2503888	Such a sweeping regulation on speech, even sexually explicit speech, is unconstitutional even if aimed at protecting minors.
2505749	2506430	I love this man.
2507332	2511356	The game does not show him having sex at all.
2532597	2533998	We're going to get some emails.
2534118	2536219	I'm looking forward to it.
2536259	2539562	Because whenever we bring up politics, it's like angry emails.
2539622	2541083	Not just angry emails, but angry emails.
2541163	2546866	Honestly, the people that I know personally who grew up very sheltered still live with their parents.
2548087	2554329	Alright, let's get back into some other gaming news and let's talk about those violent video games as well as the G-rated ones coming out very soon.
2555669	2558109	Loki, what kind of games can we expect coming out in the U.S.?
2558189	2561510	I know we're getting towards the end of the year, so not a lot, but what's coming out in the U.S.?
2561550	2568752	Not much, but it's really the only big things we've got coming out, especially this week, Animal Crossing and Final Fantasy.
2569272	2572093	Now, if you're more of a fan of the portable stuff, you've got...
2573291	2574752	A lot of stuff for the PSP.
2575533	2582237	For example, Smackdown vs. Raw 06 is coming out finally for the PSP, which is good.
2584079	2587361	Other than that, December is a very dead month for games.
2587421	2592664	The biggest game probably coming out this month is going to be Gauntlet Seven Sorrows for the PlayStation 2 and Xbox.
2594266	2595907	But a lot of everything else has moved away.
2595987	2598248	Of course, Dead Alive 4 coming out for the 360 on the 15th.
2599454	2600595	I heard they got pushed back again, though.
2601015	2604757	No, it was pushed to the 6th, and then they got pushed back to the 15th.
2605477	2607779	So, the 15th, hopefully.
2609600	2612601	But January, there's going to be a little bit more coming, hopefully.
2613142	2619725	We've got 25 to Life being the big one, the next cop-killer game that'll be coming out.
2619785	2621866	They'll be getting the press, I'm sure.
2623837	2625077	Ape Escape 3 Ape Escape Academy
2645868	2647349	DS and PSP, King Kong
2669864	2672465	on the Xbox and GameCube, Chronicles of Narnia.
2673086	2680889	We have WWE SmackDown vs. Raw 2006 for the PSP and The Sims 2 and King Kong on the Game Boy Advance.
2681750	2685912	Actually, and I do apologize because Sims 2 and King Kong are coming out on the 16th and 17th.
2687373	2692095	But I find it incredibly hilarious that the UK is getting a release of America's Army Rise of a Soldier.
2693172	2695073	You know, it's a very popular game over here.
2695113	2700635	It's kind of got a little underground following that we don't talk about much, but I've run into a lot of people that are really into this game.
2701236	2709819	Well, it is supposed to be a fairly accurate representation, but I don't know why I find it funny that it's being released overseas.
2712412	2714734	Loki, you've got a story about Madden in general.
2730760	2731120	and so on.
2755717	2757198	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
2781970	2782631	Three years later.
2783011	2785572	You also do the same thing in Derby Owners Club with horses.
2786373	2789054	Well, kind of, but... That's a little different.
2789074	2789915	A little different, yeah.
2789975	2790896	Breed your own human.
2791896	2792677	All right, interesting.
2792737	2793797	Well, we'll see what happens with that.
2794057	2796879	That'll be a fun court battle, or more likely, out-of-court settlement.
2796959	2797860	We'll see what happens with that.
2798719	2804044	DarkSakura is here to remind us that there is a big world out there outside of gaming.
2804064	2810409	Because if all you did all day long was stay outside and play video games, you would have no time to go out and corrupt the youth of America.
2811030	2813772	So DarkSakura... She just gave me a face.
2814393	2814973	I got a face.
2815654	2817275	That's a knowing smile.
2817335	2822460	DarkSakura is here to give us her advice column because there's a whole world outside.
2822540	2823100	Go live in it.
2823380	2825082	DarkSakura, what are you going to tell the kids about today?
2825560	2829221	Today's bit of advice is how to evade a stampede of shoppers.
2830122	2831062	Oh, now this is good.
2831382	2832643	This is very timely.
2833623	2834103	I like this.
2834523	2834964	Yeah.
2835744	2837945	Number one, react immediately.
2838405	2840306	Stay focused and visualize your goal.
2840366	2844307	Reacting early and decisively in crowds affords you your best shot at survival.
2844927	2848329	Two, do not join the herd.
2849369	2851410	You cannot shop if you cannot see the merchandise.
2852894	2855996	3.
2853395	2855996	Do not move toward the herd.
2856817	2860480	You risk being trampled if you try to thread your way through a stampede.
2861140	2871387	If you are unable to get out of the way, bring your arms in tightly around any packages you are carrying, turn your body in the direction of the crowd, and let yourself be carried along as you work your way to the outside.
2873286	2875127	Maximize your movement options.
2875248	2878230	If you need to negotiate your way through a crowd, stay on the edge.
2878710	2884094	Most shoppers will leave at least a few feet between themselves and surrounding walls so you will have room to maneuver.
2884595	2888077	But my final bit of advice, just avoid the mall.
2888097	2890879	You don't need a tickle meal or whatever it is this year.
2891360	2892861	Seriously, I went to the mall today.
2893982	2894782	You went to the mall.
2894882	2895923	I know, I went to the mall.
2895943	2898805	I spent half my time looking for a parking space.
2899586	2899866	That's it.
2901317	2901677	Interesting.
2901837	2908559	Amazingly enough, last year I actually had a pretty easy time parking because I have mad parking lots going.
2908679	2909239	Oh, no.
2909479	2911280	I even did the trick at the local mall.
2911300	2918021	What you do is you drive up the parking structure to the very, very top because there's a secret entrance to the mall that I thought nobody knew about.
2918082	2919742	But, oh, my God, completely full.
2919862	2921803	The parking lot at the top, completely full.
2922363	2923483	I follow people who leave.
2924960	2925220	Yeah, I know.
2925240	2926841	That's what you're supposed to do in the city and stuff.
2926941	2927661	Whatever.
2927681	2928141	I stalk.
2928301	2928701	Whatever.
2928921	2929201	All right.
2929442	2932603	Anyway, a couple quick last few items for you guys here.
2932623	2934043	I have just a couple quick stories.
2934063	2936324	We'll go over to... Sorry, guys.
2936364	2937124	I'm having mic problems again.
2937644	2939725	A couple quick stories for you guys, and we'll go over to Loki.
2941005	2941826	I think this is interesting.
2941866	2944707	There's the Star Trek MMO that's coming out very soon.
2945067	2954530	Well, there was a study done, which was quizzing 600 gamers who were interested in both Star Trek and MMORPGs.
2955210	2959072	divided them into three subgroups based on their interest, blah blah blah blah blah.
2959392	2968256	The result, 69% of MMO players were interested in Star Trek Online, and 59% of Star Trek enthusiasts wanted to play the game.
2968596	2975659	However, only 31% of regular PC gamers were eager to jump onto Star Trek Online.
2975739	2976919	I gotta say, I'm curious.
2977319	2980521	I think there's a lot of interesting ideas they could do with a Star Trek game.
2980581	2983882	I wouldn't call myself a Trekkie, but I think it could make a decent game.
2984151	2985022	I want to play a cue.
2987990	2988390	Interesting.
2988811	2995535	Alright, that was done by the way Nielsen Research and Perpetual Entertainment who are developing the upcoming PC MMO.
2996016	2997056	One other quick story for you guys.
2997096	2999818	Halo the movie has a rumored director attached.
2999918	3000599	Rumored, rumored.
3001940	3004081	I'm going to pronounce this name hideously wrong.
3004121	3004422	I'm sorry.
3004742	3005302	Guillermo?
3005703	3006123	Guillermo?
3006203	3006483	I don't know.
3006503	3013428	Guillermo del Toro who directed Hellboy is rumored to be the person that they are courting to get to do the Halo movie.
3013828	3017451	I think most people would just rather see Peter Jackson do it himself, but
3018723	3019063	Who knows?
3019123	3020925	After you guys see King Kong, you might feel differently.
3020945	3021445	I don't know.
3022366	3022727	We'll see.
3024308	3025289	Loki, what else you got for us?
3025309	3026570	Didn't Peter Jackson also do Dead Alive?
3027190	3028752	He also did Meet the Feebles.
3029052	3029653	Let's not forget.
3030473	3031814	Any last stories you got, Loki?
3031934	3032875	Some real quick stuff.
3033316	3035938	The new Grand Theft Auto mod has just
3036647	3037868	Superjump, The Ability to Walk Through Walls
3061767	3063548	It's Half-Life 2 Survivor.
3063668	3066530	It's actually a first-person shooter for the arcade.
3067150	3069732	It's going to have a card system to be able to save your progress.
3069952	3072733	Basically, the controls kind of look like a driving cabinet.
3072773	3077856	You have two controllers, one for looking, one for aiming, and then foot pedals for jumping and crouching.
3077916	3079477	So the grid, but way better.
3079957	3081238	Yeah, way better.
3081498	3083679	So that's kind of a really cool game.
3084180	3085560	I thought the grid was your favorite game.
3086341	3086441	No.
3087128	3095594	There's been also another kind of marketing campaign going on for the PSP, one featuring dust bunnies and a squirrel.
3096655	3097996	And it's really strange.
3098056	3101759	They describe the PSP as like a nut you can play with outside.
3102519	3106122	What's very interesting, though... There's no sense in... Oh, whatever.
3106182	3106502	Forget it.
3106562	3111025	What's very interesting, though, and this is actually... They've got...
3111889	3124199	These weird swirly things in the eyes that kind of look stoned, which also matches this new campaign that's going on, kind of a graffiti campaign, which you see kids basically hypnotized by the PSP.
3124899	3138490	Now, most people aren't liking this, and they're actually tagging over it and writing very colorful things like, I'll ride a Brompton bicycle or a teabag of mine before I give Sony Corp another fucking dime.
3139491	3139591	And
3140922	3144725	I like the part about the mime.
3145465	3147387	Because there's not enough mime violence in the world.
3147427	3148467	Not enough mime violence.
3148567	3150689	But it's basically popping up everywhere.
3150729	3154551	They've actually caught some of the artists responsible for it.
3155072	3155792	Pictures of them.
3156272	3159374	So another campaign that's not really welcome.
3161236	3162016	And finally...
3163868	3166810	I hope you enjoy that 360 for what you paid for They have so voided that warranty
3193513	3195135	Yes, and that is it.
3210931	3214812	But using Google Maps to do it is playing Risk on Google Maps.
3214892	3219634	Well, if you wanted to check out this game, sorry, too bad, it's done.
3220114	3223875	It got ceased and desisted by Hasbro, who owns the right to Risk.
3223915	3230397	And did you know put out their own versions of Risk in 96 and 2000, I believe the goodbye message said.
3231077	3234558	Nevertheless, Hasbro none too happy that somebody is infringing on their trademark.
3235058	3242186	My suggestion to the authors, rename it World Conquest and make it similar but not the same.
3243127	3243888	Yeah, whatever.
3244228	3245790	Make it Nobody Can Take Russia.
3247705	3251066	or, you know, Google Maps will let you go anywhere.
3251146	3254346	So you could do, like, you know, Canadian Conquest.
3255006	3256446	Just choose Canada.
3256547	3258887	Or you could do L.A.
3258947	3259647	Conquest.
3259707	3260947	Just zoom in on L.A.
3260967	3261807	and do Risk.
3261967	3262468	Oh, forget it.
3262988	3264148	Iowa Conquest.
3264248	3264488	What?
3264988	3265928	Iowa Conquest.
3266328	3266668	Iowa.
3268429	3269449	Delaware Conquest.
3270649	3272449	Yeah, we definitely have to end this show now.
3272509	3274129	So, Loki, what is your final thought?
3274710	3277010	My final thought is I'm going to play more games this week.
3278337	3283020	And my final thought would be, so am I. DarkSakura, your final thought.
3284061	3287103	Reject false icons, and I would like to be over the plague any minute now.
3287844	3288184	Alright.
3288684	3289965	Until next time, kids.
3291346	3293708	Which, by the way, did you know next week is episode number 50?
3295309	3295809	Good times.
3295989	3296850	We'll see you then.
3298971	3302555	That's the end of another Orange Lounge Radio To Go edition.
