00:00.149 --> 00:02.611
[SPEAKER_04]: Orange Lounge Radio To Go Edition, week of December 12th, 2005.

00:02.832 --> 00:13.181
[SPEAKER_02]: You're tuned in to the Orange Lounge Radio To Go Edition, your podcast home for all the latest video game news and gamer chat.

00:13.422 --> 00:16.845
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, here are your hosts, DarkSakura, Sky, and Loki.

00:18.615 --> 00:30.012
[SPEAKER_04]: Hello everybody once again and welcome to Orange Lounge Radio To Go, your home for discussion on video games, video game news, video game discussion about games that don't suck.

00:30.473 --> 00:34.319
[SPEAKER_04]: But sometimes we do have to talk about games that do suck just to tell you to avoid them.

00:34.819 --> 00:37.781
[SPEAKER_04]: Tonight is episode 50 of our podcast.

00:37.961 --> 00:38.381
[SPEAKER_04]: Yay.

00:39.022 --> 00:40.743
[SPEAKER_04]: It means 50 weeks in a row we've been here.

00:41.303 --> 00:42.464
[SPEAKER_04]: Podcasting is that new.

00:42.924 --> 00:46.807
[SPEAKER_04]: It's only been around like a little bit in a year, you know, so it's kind of cool.

00:47.947 --> 00:50.389
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're just a couple weeks from our one year anniversary, of course, that means.

00:51.730 --> 00:54.892
[SPEAKER_04]: With me, as always, is the one and only Dark Sakura.

00:55.452 --> 00:55.772
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi.

00:56.152 --> 00:56.573
[SPEAKER_04]: How you doing?

00:57.673 --> 00:58.994
[SPEAKER_00]: My voice keeps coming and going.

00:59.755 --> 01:01.636
[SPEAKER_04]: You still have the plague.

01:01.676 --> 01:02.036
[SPEAKER_04]: Plaguey.

01:03.536 --> 01:04.597
[SPEAKER_00]: I do still have the plague.

01:04.637 --> 01:09.779
[SPEAKER_00]: It sucks because I've learned that lung cookies really are not a delicacy.

01:10.960 --> 01:11.340
[SPEAKER_04]: I see.

01:12.741 --> 01:14.702
[SPEAKER_04]: Also with us, say hello to the one and only Loki.

01:14.922 --> 01:15.322
[SPEAKER_04]: Hello.

01:15.482 --> 01:16.062
[SPEAKER_04]: How are you doing?

01:16.763 --> 01:17.643
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm quite stuffed up.

01:18.304 --> 01:19.985
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm also sick, so you know what that means.

01:20.225 --> 01:22.906
[SPEAKER_04]: All three of us are sick.

01:22.926 --> 01:25.047
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think we all have the plague, but we all have something bad.

01:25.067 --> 01:25.527
[SPEAKER_04]: I have the plague.

01:26.128 --> 01:26.308
[SPEAKER_04]: I know.

01:26.588 --> 01:26.948
[SPEAKER_04]: It's horrible.

01:26.968 --> 01:28.569
[SPEAKER_04]: We had to cancel our live show this week.

01:28.649 --> 01:30.030
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you both have the microplague.

01:30.370 --> 01:30.710
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe.

01:31.030 --> 01:31.611
[SPEAKER_04]: Mini-plague.

01:31.731 --> 01:32.211
[SPEAKER_00]: Mini-plague.

01:33.052 --> 01:34.614
[SPEAKER_00]: I shall call it mini-plague.

01:35.054 --> 01:37.076
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know, but it sucks.

01:38.757 --> 01:40.359
[SPEAKER_04]: We weren't going to call in sick for episode 50.

01:40.659 --> 01:44.542
[SPEAKER_04]: This would happen to us on a landmark-style show to us.

01:46.164 --> 01:48.065
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, let's get into it.

01:48.285 --> 01:49.446
[SPEAKER_04]: Same schtick as always.

01:49.867 --> 01:52.149
[SPEAKER_04]: What kind of stuff have you been playing this week, DarkSakura?

01:53.410 --> 01:54.211
[SPEAKER_00]: Animal Crossing.

01:55.632 --> 01:59.095
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been playing with my villagers and hitting you in the head with a net.

02:00.391 --> 02:02.952
[SPEAKER_00]: and hitting people I don't know in your village with a net.

02:03.753 --> 02:05.474
[SPEAKER_00]: And I stubbed you in the toe with my shovel.

02:05.954 --> 02:08.115
[SPEAKER_04]: And you also planted a pitfall that I fell into, thank you.

02:08.695 --> 02:13.257
[SPEAKER_00]: I planted one for myself so that I could fall into it right in front of you to make you feel better.

02:13.658 --> 02:18.520
[SPEAKER_04]: But you got out of it before I was able to get my bug net out and start whacking you while you were in the hole, so it made me sad.

02:19.741 --> 02:20.001
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry.

02:20.461 --> 02:23.042
[SPEAKER_00]: This is me giving you a flat look that our listeners can't hear.

02:24.423 --> 02:25.023
[SPEAKER_00]: Great radio.

02:25.644 --> 02:25.904
[SPEAKER_00]: I, uh...

02:27.077 --> 02:44.650
[SPEAKER_00]: I also have been watching Dan play a lot of that game that I'm getting really bored of watching, the Project Gotham Racing 3, because it looks like the cars are still floating over the ground, and that's all I hear is, Crash!

02:46.391 --> 02:46.811
[SPEAKER_00]: Shit!

02:48.673 --> 02:49.153
[SPEAKER_00]: No!

02:49.233 --> 02:49.874
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't go that way!

02:51.635 --> 02:55.858
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, I also hear the same thing while he's playing Need for Speed Underground on the Xbox.

02:56.829 --> 03:09.092
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been playing Animal Crossing, which is fun, and I've been playing a little bit Need for Speed, or not Need for Speed, Average Racer 6, because that's cool.

03:11.093 --> 03:11.813
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been playing...

03:24.787 --> 03:28.871
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, very, very little of Project Gotham because I kind of suck at the game.

03:29.371 --> 03:29.851
[SPEAKER_03]: Amp 3.

03:29.972 --> 03:30.912
[SPEAKER_03]: Amp 3 is really fun.

03:32.234 --> 03:38.599
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, and I finally got my 360 because I had to go buy it from somebody who was charging an exorbitant amount of money for it.

03:39.940 --> 03:40.340
[SPEAKER_03]: But you know what?

03:40.381 --> 03:40.901
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm satisfied.

03:41.882 --> 03:42.362
[SPEAKER_03]: Shame!

03:43.163 --> 03:43.683
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what?

03:44.184 --> 03:45.545
[SPEAKER_03]: It's all Microsoft's fault.

03:45.805 --> 03:47.667
[SPEAKER_00]: Our listeners can't see me pointing and laughing.

03:48.848 --> 03:49.348
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

03:49.388 --> 03:50.589
[SPEAKER_04]: You let me down, Loki.

03:50.709 --> 03:52.331
[SPEAKER_04]: No, it's... You know...

03:53.390 --> 03:53.650
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura,

04:24.690 --> 04:25.070
[SPEAKER_03]: That is it.

04:25.431 --> 04:25.671
[SPEAKER_03]: Two.

04:28.693 --> 04:31.395
[SPEAKER_03]: At that rate, my 360 would arrive in February.

04:33.677 --> 04:38.000
[SPEAKER_04]: So now, didn't you get a tip that a bunch of Best Buys are getting a bunch more 360s on a particular day?

04:38.020 --> 04:39.101
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I don't want to wait in line.

04:39.802 --> 04:41.983
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't want to wait early in the morning in line for this stuff.

04:42.003 --> 04:44.145
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, what about our listeners who might want to know the tip?

04:46.046 --> 04:52.271
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, there's going to be a lot of 360s arriving at Best Buy for their December 18th sale.

04:52.671 --> 04:53.452
[SPEAKER_03]: They're going to have

04:54.016 --> 04:55.277
[SPEAKER_03]: At least 20 per store.

04:56.458 --> 04:57.659
[SPEAKER_03]: Some a lot more than that.

04:58.400 --> 05:02.063
[SPEAKER_03]: And you can actually find... There's a whole list I posted in my live journal.

05:02.303 --> 05:03.744
[SPEAKER_04]: Where did you figure this out?

05:03.784 --> 05:05.826
[SPEAKER_04]: Because the list you got looked really official.

05:05.966 --> 05:07.187
[SPEAKER_03]: It's on GameFAQs.

05:08.328 --> 05:12.051
[SPEAKER_03]: Someone had posted a list that I guess is off of a printout or something.

05:12.091 --> 05:17.195
[SPEAKER_03]: But anyways, basically most of the stores like an R. We're getting 24 per store.

05:17.295 --> 05:19.717
[SPEAKER_03]: One of them was getting 30 or 40, I think.

05:19.917 --> 05:22.019
[SPEAKER_03]: But that's about it.

05:22.099 --> 05:22.660
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, so...

05:23.575 --> 05:25.758
[SPEAKER_03]: If you want one, you better be waiting in line again.

05:25.798 --> 05:27.540
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like the launch all over again.

05:27.840 --> 05:35.529
[SPEAKER_03]: Which I find funny because Best Buy is getting, what, like, tons of these 360s and GameStop is getting two.

05:37.191 --> 05:37.671
[SPEAKER_03]: What the hell?

05:38.813 --> 05:42.457
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, that's because for every Best Buy there's like 20 GameStops, at least in this area.

05:43.578 --> 05:44.278
[SPEAKER_03]: It's ridiculous.

05:44.378 --> 05:47.859
[SPEAKER_03]: But anyways, the whole thing is just, it's a big rip-off.

05:47.899 --> 05:54.081
[SPEAKER_03]: And before you go and buy your 360, take a good look at what accessories you need and how much those are going to cost.

05:54.561 --> 05:55.361
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me tell you this much.

05:56.442 --> 06:02.923
[SPEAKER_03]: I ended up using my entire pre-order amount of money on the 360 that I had on there.

06:03.303 --> 06:04.464
[SPEAKER_03]: $430 on accessories.

06:05.144 --> 06:07.345
[SPEAKER_03]: That is how much their fucking accessories cost.

06:08.525 --> 06:11.886
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, those controllers, $50 each for the wireless ones.

06:12.086 --> 06:12.266
[SPEAKER_03]: Those

06:12.628 --> 06:15.889
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, component cables, try $40 for stupid cables.

06:15.989 --> 06:17.530
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it's ridiculous.

06:17.850 --> 06:19.631
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you get a core system, good luck.

06:20.711 --> 06:31.175
[SPEAKER_00]: I do understand that someone went into, I think it was at my husband's store, and dropped three grand on his Platinum 360 with controllers and games.

06:33.616 --> 06:33.816
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.

06:34.955 --> 06:36.376
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't feel sorry for them one bit.

06:37.057 --> 06:42.622
[SPEAKER_03]: For them losing, oh, poor things losing $140 per system they sell.

06:43.023 --> 06:45.085
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, don't fucking care, okay?

06:46.846 --> 06:48.788
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, even, I had to get a core system.

06:48.868 --> 06:49.589
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the one I got.

06:50.310 --> 06:52.392
[SPEAKER_03]: And it has composite cables with it.

06:52.732 --> 06:54.654
[SPEAKER_03]: The composite cables only have S-video on them.

06:54.694 --> 06:56.415
[SPEAKER_03]: You have to buy separate cables, which are $30.

06:56.796 --> 06:59.278
[SPEAKER_03]: Way more than any other cables I've seen.

06:59.839 --> 07:00.179
[SPEAKER_03]: But, uh,

07:04.822 --> 07:18.095
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think you need anything better than Composite unless you're running an HDTV or like a computer monitor or something.

07:18.616 --> 07:22.680
[SPEAKER_03]: The only thing that you will run into is that text is hard to read if you don't have S-Video or something like that.

07:24.022 --> 07:24.342
[SPEAKER_03]: That's it.

07:25.433 --> 07:27.054
[SPEAKER_04]: So what are your impressions of Xbox 360?

07:27.254 --> 07:29.314
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it worth all the money you poured into it?

07:29.875 --> 07:38.138
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, yeah, because I'm going to use it a lot here and with my job at work and stuff, so it is worth it in that sense.

07:38.618 --> 07:39.978
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was going to pick it up at some point.

07:40.399 --> 07:42.959
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, other people have done the same, you know, they spent money on it.

07:43.680 --> 07:48.041
[SPEAKER_03]: And I just, I don't see, I had like six games waiting for the system.

07:48.121 --> 07:51.783
[SPEAKER_03]: I just didn't want to wait another two months to be able to not play these games or whatever.

07:52.663 --> 07:54.843
[SPEAKER_03]: But so far, you know, I like it.

07:55.044 --> 07:55.704
[SPEAKER_03]: It's pretty fun.

07:55.944 --> 08:00.305
[SPEAKER_03]: It's definitely a pretty good game system.

08:00.325 --> 08:07.546
[SPEAKER_03]: Project Gotham, though, is more like Gran Turismo than me, and I don't really like Gran Turismo, but it is still pretty, you know, it's a nice game.

08:08.226 --> 08:09.447
[SPEAKER_03]: But I don't know.

08:09.607 --> 08:17.468
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm hoping that most of these games that come out, because I haven't played a lot of the games yet, aren't just all pretty graphics and horrible gameplay.

08:18.348 --> 08:20.409
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you get a chance to play Perfect Dark Zero yet?

08:20.749 --> 08:21.069
[SPEAKER_03]: Not yet.

08:21.459 --> 08:21.919
[SPEAKER_00]: Project Gotham

08:44.060 --> 08:45.081
[SPEAKER_04]: But, um, I don't know.

08:45.541 --> 08:50.245
[SPEAKER_04]: It just seemed like all it was was stuff that the Xbox could do, but now supporting HDTV.

08:50.285 --> 08:55.049
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm thinking, you know, if this, you know, I'm lucky to have a 30-something inch HDTV.

08:55.549 --> 08:59.993
[SPEAKER_04]: If I didn't have that, I don't think the game would look that much better than the regular Xbox.

09:00.173 --> 09:04.717
[SPEAKER_04]: So, or a computer monitor or something else to hook it up to that can support the higher-end textures.

09:05.177 --> 09:05.758
[SPEAKER_04]: So, I don't know.

09:06.118 --> 09:06.798
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not sure I...

09:07.739 --> 09:09.041
[SPEAKER_04]: Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter

09:27.813 --> 09:29.555
[SPEAKER_04]: I kind of think at this point they should have just waited.

09:30.776 --> 09:31.276
[SPEAKER_04]: They should have.

09:31.697 --> 09:35.220
[SPEAKER_04]: I understand why they were trying to rush for Christmas.

09:35.240 --> 09:40.584
[SPEAKER_04]: They have become the talked about item for Christmas, which is what they wanted, but at what price?

09:40.945 --> 09:46.510
[SPEAKER_03]: I think they've really fucked up this whole launch, and a lot of people are definitely pissed off at them.

09:46.910 --> 09:53.076
[SPEAKER_03]: Granted, some people are going to care and they're still going to get their 360, but some of them are saying, fuck this, I'm going to wait for the PS3.

09:53.896 --> 10:17.952
[SPEAKER_04]: and I mean even if that is a small percentage that's still your core customers you're losing because you chose to do this I don't know don't you think though that with the right game those people would come back to play Devil's Advocate a little bit don't you think with the right game coming out in the future you know especially you know what is what is it the Xbox 360 lacks right now role-playing games right let's say that you know with with all these developments that some of the folks that were working for Square going over to make games for the 360 starting their own company

10:18.254 --> 10:24.099
[SPEAKER_04]: When some of these games come out, that's going to make the 360 a hell of a lot more desirable no matter how bad their launch was.

10:25.000 --> 10:28.643
[SPEAKER_03]: All the pencils coming out for the PS3 and all that stuff too.

10:29.124 --> 10:45.018
[SPEAKER_00]: Microsoft did get support from Sega, Tetsuya Mizuguchi, Sakaguchi, Okamoto, all the big guys that were with Square, Capcom.

10:45.778 --> 10:49.041
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, so it's interesting to see what's going to be coming up in the future.

10:49.142 --> 10:49.442
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

10:49.842 --> 10:56.809
[SPEAKER_04]: I just think, although this launch might be screwy, and people are talking shit now, I think people are going to overlook it in a year.

10:57.269 --> 11:03.255
[SPEAKER_04]: But you're right, it really depends on the strength of the PS3, but hopefully Sony's taking notes and they'll have enough chips when they're ready to go.

11:03.795 --> 11:08.199
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, hopefully it comes down to, let's not all launch, the worldwide launch was dumb.

11:08.860 --> 11:09.641
[SPEAKER_03]: It was really dumb.

11:11.240 --> 11:13.001
[SPEAKER_04]: And they didn't truly launch worldwide.

11:13.041 --> 11:14.522
[SPEAKER_04]: They launched in three major markets.

11:14.902 --> 11:15.662
[SPEAKER_03]: The three biggest markets.

11:15.742 --> 11:18.044
[SPEAKER_03]: You split up your systems and you have shortages in three countries.

11:18.484 --> 11:19.525
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't call that worldwide launch.

11:19.565 --> 11:21.066
[SPEAKER_03]: I call that, oh, I shipped somebody.

11:21.126 --> 11:22.026
[SPEAKER_03]: It's someplace else.

11:22.046 --> 11:23.367
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, good point.

11:23.887 --> 11:27.109
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, anyway, as far as other games I played this week, of course, Animal Crossing is big news.

11:27.350 --> 11:28.770
[SPEAKER_04]: And I've checked out Animal Crossing.

11:29.371 --> 11:31.892
[SPEAKER_04]: It's very similar to the GameCube version.

11:32.133 --> 11:34.034
[SPEAKER_04]: I kind of call it Animal Crossing Plus.

11:34.912 --> 11:35.412
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

11:52.788 --> 12:01.490
[SPEAKER_04]: It does, but that's okay because... The land is different, but it makes it nice, makes it that seamless feeling to it.

12:01.790 --> 12:06.211
[SPEAKER_04]: It sounds like the objectives take longer, and of course the Wi-Fi is pretty cool.

12:06.871 --> 12:08.092
[SPEAKER_04]: The first couple days were rough.

12:08.132 --> 12:13.493
[SPEAKER_04]: I was getting a lot of communication errors those first two days, but it's calmed down a lot, and I've had a lot of people in and out of my village.

12:13.793 --> 12:14.193
[SPEAKER_04]: What can I say?

12:14.213 --> 12:17.354
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm an Animal Crossing whore.

12:17.954 --> 12:19.354
[SPEAKER_04]: Overall, the experience has been pretty good.

12:19.434 --> 12:21.475
[SPEAKER_04]: Sometimes it can be really slow that...

12:22.318 --> 12:23.258
[SPEAKER_04]: Wifi stuff.

12:23.318 --> 12:29.741
[SPEAKER_04]: Not that you get lagged, but that when somebody comes into your village, save, wait, here they come, save.

12:30.001 --> 12:33.903
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a pretty slow process, but overall, can't complain.

12:34.283 --> 12:40.206
[SPEAKER_04]: It certainly adds so much more to the game where you don't have to be taking a physical memory card over to somebody else's house.

12:40.706 --> 12:45.208
[SPEAKER_04]: If you enjoyed Animal Crossing on the GameCube, you will enjoy this on the DS.

12:45.768 --> 12:49.810
[SPEAKER_04]: I think you'll kind of find that you're kind of rediscovering what you liked about Animal Crossing 1 all over again.

12:49.850 --> 12:51.131
[SPEAKER_04]: My fear about this game

12:51.591 --> 12:55.332
[SPEAKER_04]: is that it's going to be another Nintendogs that in two weeks none of us will be playing it anymore.

12:56.213 --> 12:57.373
[SPEAKER_04]: After we all pay off our houses.

12:57.413 --> 12:58.613
[SPEAKER_04]: That was the problem with Animal Crossing 1.

12:58.914 --> 13:00.534
[SPEAKER_04]: After everybody paid off their house, oh, bye game.

13:01.634 --> 13:02.835
[SPEAKER_04]: And I don't know.

13:04.876 --> 13:06.416
[SPEAKER_04]: It's typical to say at this point.

13:06.676 --> 13:10.638
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's also, you know, not trying to collect all the retro Nintendo games anymore.

13:10.658 --> 13:11.698
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, you don't have that anymore.

13:11.718 --> 13:13.779
[SPEAKER_00]: I know people who still tend to their GameCube houses.

13:14.539 --> 13:16.820
[SPEAKER_00]: I know, and there's always going to be... There's also babysitting my village.

13:17.080 --> 13:20.701
[SPEAKER_04]: There's going to be the hardcore, you know, people, but for the average gamer...

13:21.477 --> 13:23.418
[SPEAKER_04]: I think they're going to move on after a couple weeks.

13:23.698 --> 13:26.078
[SPEAKER_04]: I just have this bad feeling it's going to be another Nintendogs.

13:26.598 --> 13:26.879
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

13:26.919 --> 13:29.659
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it'll last longer than Nintendogs because I think there's more to do.

13:30.279 --> 13:32.320
[SPEAKER_04]: But I just, I don't know.

13:32.340 --> 13:36.621
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't see this thrill lasting, especially with, you know, games that are going to be coming out in January, February.

13:37.061 --> 13:38.702
[SPEAKER_04]: I think this was a good time for the game to come out.

13:39.902 --> 13:40.802
[SPEAKER_04]: But I don't know.

13:40.822 --> 13:43.083
[SPEAKER_04]: I just don't see the honeymoon lasting forever with Animal Crossing.

13:43.835 --> 13:53.035
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's going to stick around for a little while we'll see ever since I got Animal Crossing I haven't touched Mario Kart I'll probably go back to that though anyway

13:54.116 --> 13:54.236
[SPEAKER_04]: XBOX 360

14:14.813 --> 14:15.654
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura.com

14:36.829 --> 14:40.955
[SPEAKER_04]: There, of course, Microsoft is not calling this a failure yet in Japan.

14:41.055 --> 14:47.724
[SPEAKER_04]: I think a lot of, you know, you can really tell who the MS fanboys and the anti-MS fanboys are because, you know, I'm sure the anti-Microsoft...

14:50.525 --> 14:51.246
[SPEAKER_04]: My mic went out again.

14:51.366 --> 14:55.168
[SPEAKER_04]: The anti-Microsoft people are quick to jump on this and say, oh, they failed.

14:55.608 --> 14:56.948
[SPEAKER_04]: Xbox 360 failed in Japan.

14:57.709 --> 14:58.209
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

14:59.590 --> 15:02.231
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been pretty critical of Microsoft in the past.

15:02.812 --> 15:03.212
[SPEAKER_04]: Stupid mic.

15:03.512 --> 15:09.015
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been pretty critical of Microsoft in the past, but I don't say just because they had a slower launch, don't count them out.

15:09.395 --> 15:12.777
[SPEAKER_04]: Again, we were just talking about, you know, the big games are going to be coming out.

15:13.726 --> 15:20.030
[SPEAKER_04]: Later next year, and what are the games that Japanese gamers really want that aren't out on the Xbox 360 at all right now?

15:20.431 --> 15:21.331
[SPEAKER_03]: Enchanted Arm.

15:22.152 --> 15:23.273
[SPEAKER_04]: RPGs in general.

15:23.453 --> 15:25.094
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm sorry, Cameo does not count.

15:25.614 --> 15:26.235
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a platformer.

15:26.455 --> 15:26.655
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

15:27.035 --> 15:30.017
[SPEAKER_04]: So, don't count it out in Japan yet.

15:30.117 --> 15:35.721
[SPEAKER_04]: Wait and see what happens when the dudes from Final Fantasy put out their game on the Xbox 360 or whatever it is they're planning.

15:36.021 --> 15:37.482
[SPEAKER_04]: Wait and see how that does or doesn't do.

15:38.043 --> 15:39.864
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the true indication of how the system's going to do.

15:40.224 --> 15:40.544
[SPEAKER_04]: I think.

15:41.405 --> 15:42.946
[SPEAKER_04]: Jamie, you have kind of a follow-up on that?

15:43.769 --> 16:07.725
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, yeah, just a lot of the market analysts in Japan are really, really down on it, saying that... In fact, there's a quote on here saying that they previously thought the Xbox 360 would gain a major share of Japanese market by taking some of the share from Sony, but now that prospect might not be realized given the limited attractiveness of its titles and lukewarm functions.

16:07.765 --> 16:09.946
[SPEAKER_00]: That last part's a direct quote.

16:10.186 --> 16:10.707
[SPEAKER_00]: However...

16:11.958 --> 16:23.568
[SPEAKER_00]: CESA survey at the Tokyo Game Show was saying that 23% of the consumers want an Xbox 360 compared to under 21% interested in the Revolution.

16:35.851 --> 16:47.577
[SPEAKER_00]: But see, the thing that gets me is that all these analysts are talking about, oh, PlayStation 3, PlayStation 3, they're comparing, they're basically comparing what exists to what might exist.

16:47.837 --> 17:01.424
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we've seen the demo, the tech, I'm sure all of us will, saw a lot of the demo stuff, you know, that's out on the internet now for the PlayStation 3, and I went and did that pretty little show they had at E3, but honestly...

17:02.970 --> 17:04.731
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't count your chickens before they're hatched.

17:05.132 --> 17:13.238
[SPEAKER_04]: Same with Nintendo because Nintendo is, you know, they're taking what's always been oranges and making apples now.

17:13.699 --> 17:14.759
[SPEAKER_04]: At least it's what they say.

17:14.780 --> 17:19.063
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, the revolution and everything is going to be not literally making apples.

17:19.123 --> 17:20.244
[SPEAKER_04]: We don't know that they've teamed up yet.

17:20.264 --> 17:25.948
[SPEAKER_04]: But, you know, it's certainly interesting because Nintendo, it almost sounds like, wants to go off in this entire other direction.

17:25.968 --> 17:27.330
[SPEAKER_04]: They're like, you know, screw specs.

17:27.670 --> 17:28.551
[SPEAKER_04]: We've got something better.

17:29.671 --> 17:29.972
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

17:31.473 --> 17:31.553
[SPEAKER_00]: Ugh.

17:31.900 --> 17:37.742
[SPEAKER_00]: I glanced over an article a few days ago where MTV got their hands on a revolution to try it out.

17:37.762 --> 17:39.903
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't remember them being overly excited.

17:39.923 --> 17:41.584
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I'm sure they gave the revolution the plague.

17:43.325 --> 17:47.006
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki, you have some more information about some interesting developments on the revolution?

17:47.066 --> 17:48.847
[SPEAKER_04]: Some type of patent or something going on there?

17:48.887 --> 17:55.370
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, the revolution, they've got basically these patents for... It's two patents for displacement mapping.

17:55.390 --> 17:59.392
[SPEAKER_03]: It's basically a technique used to kind of ease...

18:00.962 --> 18:24.357
[SPEAKER_03]: rendering 3D and 2D and what they've done is the first patent is actually about the displacement mapping itself, the actual rendering and the second is on a technique that uses basically less of the CPU to render the stuff to make basically their less powerful system just as powerful is basically what it is.

18:25.143 --> 18:31.690
[SPEAKER_04]: So my big question is, does this support your theory that the revolution, your ongoing theory throughout our past few episodes that the revolution is 3D?

18:32.251 --> 18:34.373
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't even think of the term now.

18:34.954 --> 18:35.615
[SPEAKER_04]: Stereoscopic 3D.

18:35.635 --> 18:36.215
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, thank you.

18:36.235 --> 18:38.638
[SPEAKER_03]: Stereoscopic 3D.

18:38.958 --> 18:40.240
[SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't really add to anything.

18:40.440 --> 18:43.083
[SPEAKER_03]: It's basically saying that it can render stuff a lot faster.

18:43.649 --> 18:44.049
[SPEAKER_04]: Interesting.

18:45.030 --> 18:45.351
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll see.

18:46.031 --> 18:47.393
[SPEAKER_04]: I have some news over on PlayStation 3.

18:48.674 --> 18:55.100
[SPEAKER_04]: People are saying that there's no way in hell PlayStation 3 is going to launch in spring, and Sony reassured this week, yes, they will.

18:55.140 --> 18:57.182
[SPEAKER_04]: They will be releasing in the spring.

18:58.163 --> 18:59.224
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe not in the U.S., though.

19:00.525 --> 19:03.347
[SPEAKER_04]: But they will release in the spring, at least in Japan.

19:03.987 --> 19:04.967
[SPEAKER_04]: Very interesting.

19:07.048 --> 19:10.290
[SPEAKER_04]: It seems like there's this huge still kind of question mark with the PlayStation 3.

19:10.670 --> 19:12.211
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, there's still a lot about it we don't know.

19:12.291 --> 19:14.532
[SPEAKER_04]: And spring is not that far away.

19:14.652 --> 19:17.494
[SPEAKER_04]: So it'll be interesting if this machine really does launch in the spring.

19:18.554 --> 19:20.675
[SPEAKER_04]: But, you know, I'd like to see it.

19:22.356 --> 19:22.816
[SPEAKER_04]: Be interesting.

19:23.537 --> 19:27.119
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's going to be sort of like I think the PS2 was.

19:29.008 --> 19:32.913
[SPEAKER_00]: Be released, be buggy as hell, be re-released.

19:33.113 --> 19:39.021
[SPEAKER_00]: Although amazingly enough, I actually have a very first model Japanese PS2 which has never had a problem.

19:39.853 --> 19:42.075
[SPEAKER_04]: You would think, too, that they learned from their previous mistakes.

19:42.415 --> 19:42.896
[SPEAKER_04]: You'd hope.

19:43.596 --> 19:46.819
[SPEAKER_04]: And that they're looking at what's going on with Microsoft and maybe saying, how can we prevent this?

19:46.959 --> 19:47.540
[SPEAKER_04]: At least I hope.

19:48.180 --> 19:49.141
[SPEAKER_04]: I hope everybody's looking at this.

19:49.341 --> 19:51.763
[SPEAKER_00]: Unless they put more work into it than they've been vocal about.

19:52.624 --> 19:52.984
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll see.

19:53.585 --> 20:00.190
[SPEAKER_04]: Speaking of 360, Loki, you had a story about basically Microsoft has come out and admitted why.

20:00.891 --> 20:04.474
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, the 360 supposedly is short, according to Microsoft, is because

20:05.123 --> 20:18.291
[SPEAKER_03]: of a shortage of chips, or a certain chip that was actually needed for the 360, and because the production of this chip is not quite at what they want, the 360s haven't been able to be made.

20:19.112 --> 20:24.675
[SPEAKER_03]: Basically, the yields are too low, and they're overrunning the supply of the systems.

20:26.856 --> 20:34.621
[SPEAKER_03]: And what they've said, though, is they're not going to be able to get back up to where they need to be until February.

20:36.311 --> 20:39.593
[SPEAKER_03]: Which is another reason why I bought my system when I could.

20:39.613 --> 20:42.515
[SPEAKER_04]: So basically if you don't have a pre-order, don't count on it until February.

20:43.076 --> 20:44.537
[SPEAKER_04]: Unless you're going to be camping out or something.

20:44.917 --> 20:46.398
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to be very hard to get one.

20:48.860 --> 20:53.843
[SPEAKER_04]: Speaking of the 360, their backwards compatibility has been upgraded a little bit.

20:53.903 --> 20:56.765
[SPEAKER_04]: They actually added support for a bunch of new games.

20:57.205 --> 20:59.126
[SPEAKER_04]: Except they all fall in the same family.

20:59.346 --> 21:10.970
[SPEAKER_04]: If you own any Tom Clancy game from the Xbox, pretty much, whether it be Ghost Recon 2, Summit Strike, Rainbow Six, Splinter Cell, it all now will work on your Xbox 360, thanks to backward compatibility.

21:11.010 --> 21:14.412
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, what's funny is when they initially released this, it broke Halo 2.

21:14.452 --> 21:18.233
[SPEAKER_03]: Then they had to recall the patch, and then they fixed it.

21:18.493 --> 21:19.354
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I didn't know about that.

21:19.574 --> 21:20.274
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that was funny.

21:20.494 --> 21:21.875
[SPEAKER_00]: We were playing Halo on our 360.

21:22.155 --> 21:24.136
[SPEAKER_00]: I was actually watching Dan play it.

21:24.176 --> 21:25.056
[SPEAKER_04]: Does it really look better?

21:26.662 --> 21:27.322
[SPEAKER_00]: Not noticeably.

21:28.183 --> 21:30.583
[SPEAKER_00]: A little cleaner.

21:32.164 --> 21:37.706
[SPEAKER_00]: We played it on the Xbox plenty of times that I'm pretty familiar with what it looks like on my TV.

21:38.506 --> 21:47.249
[SPEAKER_00]: And it did look a little more smooth, but it really wasn't a perceptible notice unless you were really looking for it.

21:49.326 --> 21:49.626
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

21:50.747 --> 21:57.931
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's go ahead and move on now and talk a little bit about real life because there is a big world out there outside of video games.

21:58.331 --> 22:05.495
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, if we stayed indoors and played video games all day long, we would have no time to go outside and whack people over the head with bug nets for real.

22:06.035 --> 22:11.918
[SPEAKER_04]: So DarkSakura is here to remind you that there is a big world out there, and she brings you her advice column.

22:12.619 --> 22:14.760
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, what are you going to be telling the kids about this week?

22:15.478 --> 22:18.961
[SPEAKER_00]: Today's bit of advice is how to survive if you're trapped in a walk-in freezer.

22:20.602 --> 22:22.663
[SPEAKER_04]: Wait, wasn't that an episode of Clerks, the cartoon?

22:22.843 --> 22:23.344
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, it was.

22:23.464 --> 22:23.984
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, awesome.

22:24.565 --> 22:28.928
[SPEAKER_00]: Where it had Dante wearing the diaper saying, I'm the biggest dumbass in the world.

22:31.049 --> 22:35.352
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, number one, tap several times on the door to get someone's attention.

22:36.153 --> 22:37.894
[SPEAKER_00]: Two, check the door and lock area.

22:41.091 --> 22:44.995
[SPEAKER_00]: By law, all walk-in freezers must have an emergency release switch on the interior.

22:46.136 --> 22:44.995
3.

22:46.536 --> 22:47.497
[SPEAKER_00]: Locate a power switch.

22:47.537 --> 22:49.639
[SPEAKER_00]: Some units may have an accessible on-off switch.

22:50.099 --> 22:51.380
[SPEAKER_00]: Turn off the cooling element.

22:52.401 --> 22:53.362
[SPEAKER_00]: That would be gross.

22:53.842 --> 22:55.203
[SPEAKER_00]: What if you're in there with meat?

22:56.565 --> 22:59.587
[SPEAKER_03]: Then turn it on every now and then to keep it nice and cool, but not too cold.

22:59.767 --> 23:00.948
[SPEAKER_04]: You'd come out smelling like meat.

23:01.549 --> 23:02.450
[SPEAKER_00]: Like rancid.

23:03.330 --> 23:02.450
4.

23:03.591 --> 23:04.511
[SPEAKER_00]: Locate boxes.

23:04.972 --> 23:07.234
[SPEAKER_00]: Tear cardboard boxes apart and spread them on the floor.

23:08.560 --> 23:10.622
[SPEAKER_00]: 5.

23:08.981 --> 23:10.622
[SPEAKER_00]: Look for insulating materials.

23:10.702 --> 23:15.545
[SPEAKER_04]: Lie down on the cardboard and cover yourself with paper foam or straw to preserve vitality.

23:15.565 --> 23:15.545
6.

23:15.585 --> 23:17.627
[SPEAKER_03]: Tap on the door every 15 minutes until help arrives.

23:34.488 --> 23:38.249
[SPEAKER_00]: And actually in the little picture it shows somebody sitting there with an open container of ice cream and a spoon.

23:39.589 --> 23:45.730
[SPEAKER_00]: But my final piece of advice is, you know, just leave the door open.

23:47.151 --> 23:49.811
[SPEAKER_00]: When you're cleaning out your freezer at the 7-Eleven, just leave the door open.

23:50.711 --> 23:55.652
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you're in the freezer at the 7-Eleven, you could probably get out through where they have the drinks or something.

23:56.913 --> 23:58.273
[SPEAKER_00]: Do a swan dive through the eggs.

24:00.794 --> 24:01.174
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow.

24:01.294 --> 24:02.634
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, moving on.

24:04.090 --> 24:05.411
[SPEAKER_04]: We have a nice follow-up story.

24:05.431 --> 24:19.779
[SPEAKER_04]: You remember a couple weeks ago on the show here, we had Matt from the Save King's Quest 9 campaign was on the show to talk about how King's Quest 9 had a stop put to it by the man, basically, at Vivendi, and they were doing this huge letter-writing campaign to get it going again?

24:19.899 --> 24:20.519
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, guess what?

24:20.980 --> 24:21.200
[SPEAKER_04]: They...

24:21.940 --> 24:23.062
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for watching!

24:38.843 --> 24:42.066
[SPEAKER_04]: They will be releasing the game simply as a silver lining.

24:42.146 --> 24:44.848
[SPEAKER_04]: However, all the King's Quest characters get to stay intact.

24:45.348 --> 24:50.892
[SPEAKER_04]: Presumably the reason why Vivendi would be asking them to drop the name would be in case, you know, they see that this thing does really well.

24:50.932 --> 24:53.694
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe they'll want to go, maybe we really should put out a King's Quest.

24:53.734 --> 24:55.776
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe we made a bad decision.

24:56.116 --> 24:56.596
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, you did.

24:56.977 --> 24:59.038
[SPEAKER_04]: But, kind of cool.

24:59.098 --> 25:02.200
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, you kind of have to applaud Vivendi here.

25:02.261 --> 25:05.523
[SPEAKER_04]: They were, you know, looked at as the big evil man and here they are doing the,

25:06.175 --> 25:08.277
[SPEAKER_04]: Think if they really wanted to do the big thing, then hire them to make it.

25:21.292 --> 25:21.752
[SPEAKER_04]: You'd think so.

25:21.992 --> 25:25.574
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe it depends on how well this does, because it's supposedly going to be part of a trilogy.

25:25.875 --> 25:27.796
[SPEAKER_04]: This silver lining thing is all part of a trilogy.

25:27.816 --> 25:30.417
[SPEAKER_04]: They're going the whole nine yards with this thing.

25:30.817 --> 25:31.438
[SPEAKER_04]: No pun intended.

25:31.658 --> 25:32.158
[SPEAKER_01]: We shall see.

25:32.178 --> 25:32.618
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.

25:32.638 --> 25:33.159
[SPEAKER_04]: It'll be fun.

25:33.179 --> 25:33.739
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll download it.

25:33.759 --> 25:34.239
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll check it out.

25:34.819 --> 25:35.660
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope Rosella's in it.

25:35.700 --> 25:39.322
[SPEAKER_00]: Instead of calling it King's Quest, it could be like King's Look Around.

25:40.202 --> 25:40.903
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

26:09.793 --> 26:12.734
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a little teaser trailer thing posted on the site.

26:13.415 --> 26:14.855
[SPEAKER_04]: It's very sexy, I gotta say.

26:14.935 --> 26:16.676
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just like trailers for the game.

26:17.076 --> 26:20.718
[SPEAKER_04]: And Pyramid Head you can see for like .5 seconds.

26:21.178 --> 26:23.319
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's very cool because they're advertising the movie like it's a game.

26:24.199 --> 26:25.339
[SPEAKER_04]: I gotta put this out there.

26:25.380 --> 26:26.600
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not a real trailer.

26:26.680 --> 26:28.521
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the Flash animation from the site.

26:29.061 --> 26:33.163
[SPEAKER_04]: But presumably, if the real trailer looks like that, it's gonna be sexy.

26:33.922 --> 26:34.962
[SPEAKER_04]: We have high hopes for this game.

26:34.982 --> 26:35.682
[SPEAKER_04]: Do not disappoint us.

26:35.982 --> 26:38.043
[SPEAKER_04]: However, one minor disappointment this week.

26:38.163 --> 26:39.303
[SPEAKER_04]: I think this is a disappointment.

26:39.923 --> 26:45.184
[SPEAKER_04]: It was reported that Akira Yamaoka will not actually be doing the music for the Silent Hill movie.

26:45.244 --> 26:46.564
[SPEAKER_04]: He did the music for the games.

26:46.945 --> 26:48.305
[SPEAKER_04]: He will not be doing the music for the movie.

26:48.605 --> 26:52.526
[SPEAKER_04]: That honor will go to Jeff Dana, who did the music for Resident Evil Apocalypse.

26:52.986 --> 26:57.507
[SPEAKER_04]: However, he has said... I know Jamie wants to get something in there because she's mad.

26:58.047 --> 26:59.787
[SPEAKER_04]: However, I do want to say that he said...

27:00.007 --> 27:07.854
[SPEAKER_04]: The executive producer, Andrew Mason, said that Jeff Dana will be incorporating elements from the original game's score into the movie's score.

27:08.014 --> 27:08.815
[SPEAKER_04]: So at least you get that.

27:09.015 --> 27:09.776
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I was going to say.

27:10.276 --> 27:11.297
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, okay.

27:11.597 --> 27:15.020
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been, like, every day looking at Silent Hill stuff.

27:15.401 --> 27:19.484
[SPEAKER_04]: I would still at least like to see Akira get to do, like, a vocal song or something.

27:19.504 --> 27:22.247
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, because he did such great songs for the games that could have been...

27:23.237 --> 27:28.742
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think they would have ever been a runaway MTV hit, but I think they could have really appealed to the audience that would go see Silent Hill.

27:29.102 --> 27:34.387
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, the songs like You're Not Here from 3 and, you know, stuff from 4 like Room of Angel.

27:34.407 --> 27:38.091
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm really hoping this breaks the pattern of movie game.

27:38.111 --> 27:39.352
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope so too.

27:39.492 --> 27:42.375
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks pretty dead on so far.

27:42.955 --> 27:45.157
[SPEAKER_04]: If that Flash trailer is anything, that was...

27:46.676 --> 27:47.697
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly how it should be.

27:47.917 --> 27:48.437
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly.

27:50.038 --> 27:52.000
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd play it for you guys, but we're a radio show.

27:52.180 --> 27:53.601
[SPEAKER_04]: Just go to the site and check it out.

27:54.101 --> 27:58.965
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I actually don't have the link on me because it's on my home computer.

27:59.745 --> 28:08.031
[SPEAKER_00]: But I had seen a site that had a bit more information as far as the characters in it.

28:08.091 --> 28:13.015
[SPEAKER_00]: There are at least mentions to characters that are in...

28:14.488 --> 28:15.829
[SPEAKER_00]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

28:36.049 --> 28:37.610
[SPEAKER_04]: One other video game news thing though

29:03.421 --> 29:15.649
[SPEAKER_04]: Even when you consider that Doom did not do too hot at the box office, it made $49 million worldwide on a $60 million budget, they are going to do a return to Castle Wolfenstein movie.

29:15.689 --> 29:18.451
[SPEAKER_04]: At least that's what ID Software wants to do.

29:19.071 --> 29:29.758
[SPEAKER_04]: Nobody has, I don't think, bought this yet, but they want to do it, a movie for return to Castle Wolfenstein, which you might know is, in some ways, the predecessor to Doom is

29:31.081 --> 29:32.582
[SPEAKER_04]: If you go as far back as Wolfenstein 3D.

29:32.602 --> 29:34.583
[SPEAKER_03]: Just don't do the first person crap.

29:35.463 --> 29:35.984
[SPEAKER_04]: They better not.

29:38.125 --> 29:39.785
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually did find that information, by the way.

29:39.925 --> 29:40.146
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.

29:43.007 --> 29:44.628
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, I found it on Wikipedia.

29:44.668 --> 29:45.468
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where I had seen it.

29:45.969 --> 29:53.212
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a character in the movie called Christabella who, if I remember correctly, was also a character in the comic series.

29:54.173 --> 30:00.096
[SPEAKER_00]: Several of the people, the main character, Rose, her last name is Mason, which was Heather...

30:01.252 --> 30:07.341
[SPEAKER_00]: Cheryl Mason, and Harry Mason, and there's also a Sharon Mason in this.

30:08.503 --> 30:14.953
[SPEAKER_00]: And also, I think another character in here relates to another character that had been in Silent Hill 3.

30:15.356 --> 30:16.256
[SPEAKER_04]: Animal Crossing DS Animal Crossing DS

30:38.307 --> 30:38.867
[SPEAKER_04]: WTF?

30:39.068 --> 30:40.328
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I saw that last night.

30:41.229 --> 30:42.909
[SPEAKER_04]: I did not do the K.K.

30:42.950 --> 30:46.051
[SPEAKER_04]: Slider thing because he comes to your town, what, Saturday night?

30:46.131 --> 30:50.353
[SPEAKER_00]: Saturday night between 7.30 to 8 is his warm-up, 8 to midnight is the show.

30:50.533 --> 30:54.715
[SPEAKER_04]: I usually go out clubbing Saturday nights, but not last night.

30:54.735 --> 30:55.216
[SPEAKER_04]: I was coughing.

30:55.676 --> 30:56.896
[SPEAKER_04]: But anyway, no, this is interesting.

30:57.197 --> 30:58.017
[SPEAKER_04]: Part of what K.K.

30:58.037 --> 31:04.340
[SPEAKER_04]: Slider says in his little introduction, those industry fat cats try to put a price on my music, but it wants to be free.

31:05.361 --> 31:05.761
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

31:06.488 --> 31:08.449
[SPEAKER_04]: I think somebody might be taking that a little too far.

31:08.469 --> 31:13.032
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if I'd see that as a slam against the RIAA, but... That was the first impression I got.

31:13.092 --> 31:14.333
[SPEAKER_00]: He said a little bit more than that.

31:15.274 --> 31:15.614
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

31:15.674 --> 31:18.276
[SPEAKER_04]: I just kind of got the sense that it fits into his character.

31:18.296 --> 31:21.778
[SPEAKER_04]: Because, you know, he's supposed to be this wandering nomad guy that just plays tunes.

31:21.798 --> 31:25.660
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, he gives you bootleg copies of his songs, so... I don't know.

31:25.920 --> 31:27.461
[SPEAKER_04]: I think people might be taking that a little far.

31:27.501 --> 31:27.882
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if...

31:28.542 --> 31:33.246
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it would not be in Nintendo's best interest to speak out against the RIAA, but who knows?

31:33.486 --> 31:39.210
[SPEAKER_00]: The bit if Nintendo was actually really worried about putting that impression, they would have phrased that line a little differently.

31:39.671 --> 31:40.311
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess you got a point.

31:40.992 --> 31:41.172
[SPEAKER_04]: True.

31:42.753 --> 31:51.040
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, I've got to ask about this, because we've been talking about a lot of new consoles here tonight, but I want to hear about an old console, and Loki, you have some pretty exciting news regarding an old console.

31:51.340 --> 31:57.485
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, Sega is apparently, well, it's a rumor, of course, but some German gaming site, Gamefront...

31:58.861 --> 32:02.822
[SPEAKER_03]: is claiming that they're going to be re-releasing the Dreamcast.

32:02.902 --> 32:07.564
[SPEAKER_03]: Basically it's bundled with some limited edition phone card or something.

32:08.484 --> 32:16.527
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's supposed to probably only be released in Japan and distributed through Sega Direct for about $83 US or 10,000 yen.

32:16.627 --> 32:21.768
[SPEAKER_04]: Or you could just go to GameStop and get a used one for like 30 bucks.

32:22.588 --> 32:23.529
[SPEAKER_04]: However much they're running.

32:24.449 --> 32:25.849
[SPEAKER_04]: I know, it's still a neat idea.

32:26.590 --> 32:27.730
[SPEAKER_00]: I still play my Dreamcast.

32:28.243 --> 32:29.084
[SPEAKER_04]: Dead or Alive 4 Dead or Alive 4

32:56.823 --> 32:57.984
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

33:20.819 --> 33:22.060
[SPEAKER_04]: Other than that, normal consoles, we have 25 to Life,

33:48.184 --> 33:54.146
[SPEAKER_03]: Final Fantasy IV Advance on the 13th.

33:54.166 --> 33:55.147
[SPEAKER_04]: I found that one out.

33:56.387 --> 33:56.807
[SPEAKER_04]: The hard way.

33:57.528 --> 33:59.308
[SPEAKER_03]: Final Fantasy IV on the 13th of January?

33:59.748 --> 34:00.349
[SPEAKER_04]: No, of December.

34:00.789 --> 34:01.089
[SPEAKER_04]: This week.

34:01.549 --> 34:02.889
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, yes, that's this week.

34:03.550 --> 34:09.772
[SPEAKER_03]: And then, of course, True Swing Golf, if you're a golf fan for the DS, that's pretty good.

34:11.348 --> 34:13.289
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

34:40.529 --> 34:42.830
[SPEAKER_00]: Bioshock, Call of Cthulhu, Dead to Rights.

34:44.350 --> 34:45.810
[SPEAKER_00]: A few titles along those lines.

34:45.951 --> 34:54.593
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, just out of this morbid curiosity, do they have to alter Madden NFL when they release it in Britain because football is not football there?

34:54.853 --> 34:57.654
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, as far as I was aware, it's just called American football.

34:58.754 --> 35:01.375
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if that means they've got to recode stuff in the game or whatever.

35:01.395 --> 35:04.896
[SPEAKER_03]: No, it's just called NFL, so it would be the National Football League.

35:05.176 --> 35:06.856
[SPEAKER_04]: Just curious, just one of my curiosity things.

35:07.016 --> 35:08.717
[SPEAKER_03]: I was going to mention one thing since we're talking about the UK.

35:10.189 --> 35:14.773
[SPEAKER_03]: The official Xbox 360 magazine is going to be on the January issue.

35:14.793 --> 35:19.076
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to have a disc to be able to play the Final Fantasy XI beta on the 360.

35:20.197 --> 35:21.077
[SPEAKER_04]: Here or in the UK?

35:21.338 --> 35:21.918
[SPEAKER_03]: I think in the UK.

35:21.938 --> 35:24.100
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not sure about here, but maybe.

35:25.160 --> 35:26.001
[SPEAKER_03]: So check that out.

35:27.022 --> 35:29.163
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, lucky you guys if you guys get that and America doesn't.

35:29.924 --> 35:35.408
[SPEAKER_00]: Another actually interesting game on here is Shin Megami Tensei, which we actually got over here.

35:35.628 --> 35:36.609
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, digital double-sided.

35:37.659 --> 35:40.239
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, actually, we didn't get a number of...

36:05.660 --> 36:06.601
[SPEAKER_00]: Listen up, this is great.

36:06.661 --> 36:07.341
[SPEAKER_00]: Listen to this.

36:07.381 --> 36:07.961
[SPEAKER_00]: By Gareth.

36:34.839 --> 36:37.620
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey guys, was listening to your show on the way to work today.

36:38.140 --> 36:39.981
[SPEAKER_00]: I live just outside London, UK by the way.

36:40.081 --> 36:46.963
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a 2.75 year old daughter, which piqued my interest in your chat about parents' responsibility with their kids.

36:47.423 --> 36:55.765
[SPEAKER_00]: So my daughter and I play games together, mostly things like Trackmania Sunrise, she likes painting the cars, to Incredibles to Super Mario Sunshine.

36:56.266 --> 37:00.747
[SPEAKER_00]: She also has some kids games like Dora the Explorer along with some web games on the BBC.

37:01.727 --> 37:03.728
[SPEAKER_00]: So my point, I was surprised at two things.

37:04.268 --> 37:07.150
[SPEAKER_00]: One, it is hard to get games that don't feature some sort of violence.

37:07.230 --> 37:10.571
[SPEAKER_00]: We are by nature a society that violence has a part of it.

37:11.612 --> 37:17.735
[SPEAKER_00]: Two, she was very quick to pick up on the violent parts of games and knows when she is hitting someone or something.

37:18.075 --> 37:21.237
[SPEAKER_00]: She even vocalizes it by saying hit or shoot when she does this.

37:21.837 --> 37:24.598
[SPEAKER_00]: After being a bit worried about this, I thought this is not a problem.

37:24.938 --> 37:30.281
[SPEAKER_00]: She has parents who monitor and guide her behavior and we have not seen her try to replicate the violence she has seen on the game so far.

37:31.144 --> 37:40.268
[SPEAKER_00]: I know from my experience as a long-time gamer and now a parent, that is my parents' guidance and active parenting that made the biggest difference to me being well-adjusted.

37:40.328 --> 37:41.128
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, some think so.

37:42.128 --> 37:49.551
[SPEAKER_00]: You won't be able to change your kids' environments and their exposure to violence that easily, but you definitely can be a big influence in how they react and live with it.

37:49.711 --> 37:54.433
[SPEAKER_00]: And I thought that last phrase right there was the best way anyone could ever say it.

37:54.513 --> 37:56.054
[SPEAKER_00]: You have major kudos from me.

37:56.772 --> 37:57.413
[SPEAKER_04]: Beautifully put.

37:58.734 --> 37:59.134
[SPEAKER_04]: That's right.

37:59.354 --> 38:00.476
[SPEAKER_04]: Can you get it through one more email?

38:00.816 --> 38:01.797
[SPEAKER_00]: I can get through a couple.

38:02.057 --> 38:03.118
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, cool.

38:04.639 --> 38:09.384
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, got an email from Deekman, one of our Australian listeners.

38:09.404 --> 38:11.106
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

38:11.566 --> 38:13.988
[SPEAKER_00]: Talking about the 50 Cent game.

38:14.449 --> 38:14.749
[SPEAKER_00]: 50 Cent.

38:15.009 --> 38:15.590
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, God.

38:16.631 --> 38:17.131
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, my God.

38:17.171 --> 38:18.513
[SPEAKER_04]: I watched like five minutes of the...

38:19.827 --> 38:31.241
[SPEAKER_04]: The BikeTV Video Game Awards, and I saw a little bit of that 50 Cent game, and I was just like, this is so not the type of game that appeals to me in any way, shape, or form.

38:31.681 --> 38:37.268
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you said the 50 Cent game had been banned in Australia for drug use and excessive violence.

38:37.448 --> 38:38.950
[SPEAKER_03]: And for sucking really bad.

38:39.602 --> 38:40.082
[SPEAKER_00]: DarkSakura.com

38:53.260 --> 38:54.561
[SPEAKER_03]: Horrible reviews.

38:54.901 --> 38:56.042
[SPEAKER_03]: Horrible reviews.

38:56.182 --> 38:56.642
[SPEAKER_04]: Really?

38:57.583 --> 38:58.203
[SPEAKER_04]: That's too bad.

38:59.104 --> 39:06.269
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, as I was reading, to quote, down here if a game gets an R rating, it literally can't be sold in stores.

39:06.349 --> 39:13.414
[SPEAKER_00]: Other titles include the original GTA 3 game where you could pick up hookers and screw them to get back life, which was edited out and re-released, and Manhunt.

39:14.294 --> 39:19.738
[SPEAKER_00]: In cases like this, you guys are lucky that your stuff only gets censored as much as they do and not completely banned from stores like our stuff.

39:21.010 --> 39:26.774
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, and he also mentioned that Acclaim is bankrupt and now selling off rights to games so we could get the rights to Busted Move if we wanted it.

39:27.374 --> 39:28.135
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yeah, that's right.

39:28.455 --> 39:31.657
[SPEAKER_04]: I did a story on my live show on the station this week about that.

39:31.677 --> 39:40.483
[SPEAKER_04]: That's kind of interesting, and I thought it was interesting because only one of the Mary Kay and Ashley Wilson games is being bought, sought after, out of the, like, 50 that were available.

39:41.123 --> 39:44.826
[SPEAKER_00]: There was another point made by one of our listeners in Scotland.

39:45.558 --> 39:47.961
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been getting a lot of overseas writing these days.

39:47.981 --> 39:48.842
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's pretty cool.

39:48.922 --> 39:49.984
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that's neat.

39:50.104 --> 39:50.965
[SPEAKER_00]: From Sloan.

39:53.588 --> 39:55.571
[SPEAKER_00]: Said he's got three kids, 33, and...

40:04.588 --> 40:07.329
[SPEAKER_00]: Part of the course is to discover your market when designing a game.

40:07.349 --> 40:11.472
[SPEAKER_00]: You come up with an overall concept and test the market to see who your primary persona is.

40:12.012 --> 40:21.298
[SPEAKER_00]: They mentioned a site that's DESA.com, the Entertainment Software Association, that has a report called Essential Facts About the Computer and Video Game Industry.

40:22.139 --> 40:24.220
[SPEAKER_00]: It says it has some interesting statistics.

40:26.481 --> 40:27.682
[SPEAKER_00]: for statistics.

40:28.523 --> 40:31.144
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, the average age of a game buyer is 37.

40:32.805 --> 40:37.769
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's really the parents that are buying the games, the older sibling buying the games.

40:38.469 --> 40:42.011
[SPEAKER_00]: And most of the time, it's the kid saying, hey, I want this game.

40:42.131 --> 40:44.133
[SPEAKER_00]: Or the parent saying, hey, kid, do you want this game?

40:44.173 --> 40:47.055
[SPEAKER_00]: And the kid going, sure, I'd like the suffering.

40:49.156 --> 40:52.138
[SPEAKER_00]: And yes, I've actually seen this happen just recently.

40:53.084 --> 40:55.086
[SPEAKER_00]: at one of our local video game stores.

40:55.186 --> 40:56.347
[SPEAKER_00]: So I know very well.

40:56.827 --> 41:00.790
[SPEAKER_00]: But to quote, I'm going to read this one's paragraph here I think is very important.

41:01.250 --> 41:02.612
[SPEAKER_00]: Parents need to be educated.

41:02.672 --> 41:08.096
[SPEAKER_00]: You wouldn't take your kid to an 18 certificate movie or would you?

41:08.416 --> 41:14.741
[SPEAKER_00]: My son, the 11 year old, has a friend whose parents regularly let him watch horror movies and play video games such as GTA and Doom 3.

41:15.442 --> 41:17.163
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lack of parental instruction here.

41:18.374 --> 41:27.523
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got what my children see when they are in my sight, but what are the other parents exposing my child to when they visit their friends' friends?

41:28.724 --> 41:36.151
[SPEAKER_00]: And he also goes on further and says, by age he means the kid is mature enough when you're 11 you laugh at dick and fart jokes and naked women, but that's not particularly mature.

41:36.392 --> 41:37.112
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm still doing that at 27.

41:37.192 --> 41:37.673
[SPEAKER_04]: We still tell them.

41:41.756 --> 41:44.997
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, I thought this was pretty smart.

41:45.457 --> 41:48.438
[SPEAKER_00]: Make the law similar to DVD video and liquor sales.

41:48.498 --> 41:51.899
[SPEAKER_00]: If you supply to an underage person, you can be prosecuted.

41:52.239 --> 41:53.499
[SPEAKER_00]: Parents know your ratings.

41:53.579 --> 41:57.620
[SPEAKER_00]: They are not difficult, and I agree with Rob that ratings should be the same as movies.

41:57.660 --> 42:06.643
[SPEAKER_00]: GTA series are rated by the BBFC as an 18, same as violent movie out here over here in the U.K.,

42:07.233 --> 42:09.858
[SPEAKER_00]: He also mentions to Matt, you two are quite correct.

42:09.898 --> 42:11.121
[SPEAKER_00]: Parents should do their own homework.

42:11.461 --> 42:13.846
[SPEAKER_00]: Who's responsible for a kid when they're out in the street playing?

42:14.087 --> 42:17.193
[SPEAKER_00]: It's no longer acceptable to say, it's okay, he's upstairs playing on his computer.

42:17.513 --> 42:18.856
[SPEAKER_00]: Look what happened to Matthew Broderick.

42:22.415 --> 42:23.396
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a good reference.

42:24.437 --> 42:25.699
[SPEAKER_00]: Would you like to play a game?

42:25.899 --> 42:27.300
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm thrilled that someone agrees with me.

42:27.340 --> 42:30.724
[SPEAKER_04]: That makes 50 episodes of doing this crap so worth it that somebody agrees with me.

42:31.625 --> 42:34.348
[SPEAKER_00]: My last thing on this.

42:34.408 --> 42:38.112
[SPEAKER_00]: I leave you with a quote from a congressional hearing chaired by Joe Lieberman.

42:38.432 --> 42:39.474
[SPEAKER_00]: This was a few years ago.

42:40.475 --> 42:42.497
[SPEAKER_00]: It was nice to see he still hates video games.

42:43.123 --> 42:47.028
[SPEAKER_00]: This quote is from Marilyn Droz, the VP of National Coalition of Television Violence.

42:47.048 --> 42:48.089
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what she had to say.

42:48.790 --> 43:02.686
[SPEAKER_00]: If the Pentagon was to ever have suggested years ago that we put video games that teach children how to aim guns and train them at the age of eight to be soldiers and ever invented a game to put in the homes of young boys to train them to be in the military, I can't begin to tell you...

43:03.647 --> 43:08.049
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what kind of uproar there would be in this country if our government was to start training early killers.

43:10.530 --> 43:12.430
[SPEAKER_00]: You mentioned on there America's Army.

43:12.490 --> 43:14.611
[SPEAKER_04]: Isn't that what America's Army does?

43:14.971 --> 43:17.292
[SPEAKER_00]: She was talking about the Nintendo Super Scope.

43:20.953 --> 43:22.894
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought that was such a wonderful point.

43:23.154 --> 43:25.815
[SPEAKER_04]: The Nintendo Super Scope was nothing.

43:26.508 --> 43:28.349
[SPEAKER_00]: I know, I was playing Blastress.

43:28.630 --> 43:29.971
[SPEAKER_04]: I know, and the mole game.

43:30.171 --> 43:30.651
[SPEAKER_04]: Come on.

43:30.671 --> 43:31.712
[SPEAKER_00]: This mole game was stupid.

43:32.112 --> 43:33.013
[SPEAKER_00]: But... Hey.

43:33.653 --> 43:42.019
[SPEAKER_00]: But I would, honestly, I would really, for those last two letters, I would really love to have our writers' permission to post those on our site, really.

43:42.039 --> 43:42.379
[SPEAKER_00]: Great.

43:42.419 --> 43:47.283
[SPEAKER_00]: Because those are the most well-thought-out things I have read in the past couple weeks.

43:48.123 --> 43:48.404
[SPEAKER_04]: Awesome.

43:48.424 --> 43:52.606
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, if you guys want to send us an email, togo, T-O-G-O, at orangeloungeradio.com.

43:52.647 --> 43:54.468
[SPEAKER_04]: Any last little bits you want to read?

43:54.488 --> 43:55.228
[SPEAKER_04]: Anything?

43:55.929 --> 43:56.009
[SPEAKER_00]: Um...

43:58.204 --> 44:00.467
[SPEAKER_00]: I've gotten several emails along the same lines.

44:02.009 --> 44:09.238
[SPEAKER_00]: One of our friends, our listeners, John wrote in, basically saying more of the same.

44:10.400 --> 44:14.385
[SPEAKER_00]: I especially like the point saying is that, you know,

44:15.888 --> 44:26.472
[SPEAKER_00]: No matter if you're into the violent games, listen to emo music or horror movies, you can still be a peaceful person.

44:28.393 --> 44:30.074
[SPEAKER_00]: I really liked that one point there.

44:30.434 --> 44:32.975
[SPEAKER_04]: Saying emo reminds me of this simple fact.

44:32.995 --> 44:35.036
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you know what is ten times worse than video games?

44:35.496 --> 44:35.736
[SPEAKER_00]: Emo?

44:35.996 --> 44:37.037
[SPEAKER_04]: No, Myspace.

44:38.436 --> 44:41.099
[SPEAKER_04]: I swear to God, Myspace is worse than any video game I've ever seen.

44:41.560 --> 44:46.566
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, really, and... Every kid has a profile on Myspace, it's sad.

44:46.909 --> 44:49.709
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I thought it was funny that he did actually mirror something that you said.

44:50.030 --> 44:51.950
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll just quote this last and that's the end of the mailbox.

44:52.010 --> 44:52.270
[SPEAKER_00]: Alrighty.

44:52.290 --> 44:53.570
[SPEAKER_00]: Because we got a lot of mail this time around.

44:53.590 --> 44:53.810
[SPEAKER_00]: I know.

44:54.130 --> 44:55.470
[SPEAKER_00]: This law is not a ban.

44:55.530 --> 44:59.011
[SPEAKER_00]: It's simply a way to prevent kids from buying games that their parents might not approve of.

44:59.691 --> 45:02.772
[SPEAKER_00]: Honest, caring, and hardworking parents work until 5 or 6 p.m.

45:03.192 --> 45:06.952
[SPEAKER_00]: With their child at home, they can't prevent them from going to the store and buying a GTA-type game.

45:07.993 --> 45:08.273
[SPEAKER_01]: True.

45:08.653 --> 45:08.853
[SPEAKER_01]: True.

45:09.073 --> 45:12.273
[SPEAKER_00]: And on that respect, I do support that aspect of it.

45:12.293 --> 45:13.813
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I said as much last week.

45:14.454 --> 45:16.674
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just that I still think that

45:19.511 --> 45:29.919
[SPEAKER_00]: It is really difficult, I think, on parents to have that kind of active stance in their children's lives, but I still think that if they weren't ready for the responsibility, they shouldn't have had the children to begin with.

45:31.220 --> 45:31.460
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

45:31.661 --> 45:35.463
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, we look forward to getting your more emails to go at originalsradio.com.

45:35.503 --> 45:36.624
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's get back into some news.

45:37.765 --> 45:43.049
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, Loki, I brought up the Video Game Awards on Spike TV there a little bit, and I know you caught a little glimpse of it.

45:43.370 --> 45:44.711
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you watch the whole damn thing, or what happened?

45:44.811 --> 45:47.673
[SPEAKER_03]: I watched the after show, and

45:48.280 --> 45:49.961
[SPEAKER_03]: I think this is the way video game award shows should be.

45:49.981 --> 45:50.301
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, this is

46:17.978 --> 46:18.778
[SPEAKER_03]: It was really good actually.

46:18.958 --> 46:19.898
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a very good show.

46:20.198 --> 46:22.319
[SPEAKER_03]: Definitely a whole lot better than G4ia.

46:23.759 --> 46:27.300
[SPEAKER_03]: What they started off with is Samuel L. Jackson because he was hosting the whole thing.

46:27.340 --> 46:28.980
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean that's good just from the start.

46:29.400 --> 46:34.982
[SPEAKER_03]: He was playing the part of, and I haven't played this far into the Warriors or haven't seen the movie yet.

46:35.062 --> 46:38.562
[SPEAKER_03]: The main character in the Warriors, you know the guy in the beginning like, can you dig it?

46:38.942 --> 46:41.703
[SPEAKER_03]: But they had all the video game characters in the audience and the crowd.

46:42.082 --> 46:45.104
[SPEAKER_03]: And the best part about the whole thing is you see the Katamari rolling around.

46:45.625 --> 46:48.147
[SPEAKER_03]: It's picking up people as it's going along and stuff.

46:48.187 --> 46:49.288
[SPEAKER_03]: And that was the greatest thing ever.

46:49.848 --> 46:55.172
[SPEAKER_03]: And then Tack from Tack 3 or whatever he's called.

46:55.232 --> 46:56.954
[SPEAKER_03]: He's all, Warriors!

46:57.154 --> 46:58.455
[SPEAKER_03]: Come out and play!

46:58.595 --> 47:01.577
[SPEAKER_03]: And he shoots Samuel L. Jackson.

47:01.597 --> 47:03.238
[SPEAKER_03]: And I thought that was great.

47:03.319 --> 47:04.379
[SPEAKER_03]: It was really funny.

47:05.820 --> 47:08.703
[SPEAKER_03]: They put a whole MTV Music Awards spin on it.

47:08.763 --> 47:10.204
[SPEAKER_03]: And I really liked the way they did that.

47:10.512 --> 47:11.513
[SPEAKER_04]: I watched about five minutes.

47:11.534 --> 47:12.295
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought it was stupid.

47:12.615 --> 47:12.915
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry.

47:13.917 --> 47:19.825
[SPEAKER_03]: The music part was stupid, but I did like the fact that they were doing this kind of fun little twist on it and stuff.

47:20.486 --> 47:24.572
[SPEAKER_03]: However, though, they are still... Being that there's only really two award shows out there, they are still...

47:25.154 --> 47:26.495
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, highly superior to G4U.

47:27.395 --> 47:27.756
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll see.

47:29.096 --> 47:31.958
[SPEAKER_04]: Jamie, I'm curious if you heard about this because I'm sure you've got to have an opinion on this.

47:32.278 --> 47:34.159
[SPEAKER_04]: Talk about the wrong way to hold a protest.

47:34.199 --> 47:35.180
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you hear about this kid?

47:35.460 --> 47:45.326
[SPEAKER_04]: It was like some 16-year-old kid got basically arrested, or charged anyway, by threatening the one and only Jack Thompson with torture and death.

47:46.947 --> 47:51.269
[SPEAKER_04]: He basically, I don't know, sent this thing that said all these nasty things he was going to do to Jack Thompson.

47:51.329 --> 47:52.150
[SPEAKER_04]: It's kind of one of those, like,

47:52.748 --> 47:53.228
[SPEAKER_04]: Jack Thompson

48:22.469 --> 48:31.472
[SPEAKER_04]: I know, and I feel bad because now I'm contributing to this, but I'm only reporting what's out there on the internet, because half the gaming sites out there also report this.

48:31.552 --> 48:35.773
[SPEAKER_04]: It's kind of like... I thought we were bad attention whores.

48:37.414 --> 48:39.134
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, we don't get death threats often.

48:43.018 --> 48:44.159
[SPEAKER_00]: and I'm tired of talking about him

49:05.712 --> 49:13.477
[SPEAKER_00]: I am not saying that I am going to inject him with cancerous cells so that he dies of liver cancer, but if he does I'd like to report it.

49:17.660 --> 49:20.022
[SPEAKER_04]: Swiftly changing the subject over to Castlevania.

49:20.082 --> 49:21.403
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's talk about Castlevania.

49:22.684 --> 49:24.045
[SPEAKER_04]: I think this is kind of interesting.

49:24.966 --> 49:31.451
[SPEAKER_04]: Konami, for no real reason, is going to be packaging Aria of Sorrow and Harmony of Dissonance together into one game.

49:31.852 --> 49:33.253
[SPEAKER_04]: And that will be coming out the first quarter of 2006.

49:33.633 --> 49:36.636
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's no real reason why they're doing it.

49:36.776 --> 49:38.397
[SPEAKER_04]: They're not really adding anything to these games.

49:38.958 --> 49:44.723
[SPEAKER_04]: I think they're doing this because DS is selling so freaking huge, and so they want to capitalize on that.

49:44.743 --> 49:45.904
[SPEAKER_03]: They buy little stuff all the time.

49:47.145 --> 49:48.906
[SPEAKER_00]: Pretty game, pretty.

49:48.926 --> 49:52.249
[SPEAKER_04]: Those two would still sell separately on their own, except I don't think they make either one anymore.

49:52.269 --> 49:53.390
[SPEAKER_00]: If I didn't already have them, I'd buy them.

49:54.167 --> 49:55.207
[SPEAKER_04]: I know, that's kind of how I feel.

49:56.047 --> 50:00.649
[SPEAKER_04]: Jamie, you have a story about another racing game.

50:00.669 --> 50:04.729
[SPEAKER_04]: We've been talking about Project Gotham and all this other stuff, but you have a racing game that sounds pretty hot.

50:04.990 --> 50:05.370
[SPEAKER_00]: No, no, no.

50:05.430 --> 50:07.910
[SPEAKER_00]: Best racing game series ever.

50:08.190 --> 50:08.810
[SPEAKER_00]: Outrun.

50:09.051 --> 50:09.631
[SPEAKER_00]: Woo-hoo.

50:10.871 --> 50:15.192
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, at my house, you've seen at my house, classic Sega Horror House.

50:16.072 --> 50:17.172
[SPEAKER_00]: That didn't sound too right.

50:17.372 --> 50:19.493
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, I digress.

50:20.385 --> 50:24.093
[SPEAKER_00]: SIGA's announced OutRun 2006 and we all cheer yay!

50:24.273 --> 50:24.714
[SPEAKER_00]: Yay!

50:29.541 --> 50:37.846
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, Sega's confirmed Outrun 2006 Coast to Coast will be released March 2006 on the PS2, PSP, and PC.

50:37.906 --> 50:38.526
[SPEAKER_00]: But guess what?

50:38.587 --> 50:39.747
[SPEAKER_00]: Not on... Arcade.

50:40.148 --> 50:40.608
[SPEAKER_00]: Xbox.

50:41.689 --> 50:42.329
[SPEAKER_04]: And no arcade.

50:43.310 --> 50:49.694
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't see... It's going to be 30 stages, the best of both Outrun 2 and Outrun 2 SP.

50:50.815 --> 50:53.796
[SPEAKER_00]: Mission structure, licensed mode, 6 player online.

50:54.237 --> 50:55.998
[SPEAKER_00]: Total of 12 licensed Ferraris.

50:56.892 --> 50:59.453
[SPEAKER_00]: including the F430 and Super America.

50:59.493 --> 51:01.474
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, you said something about Outrun 2 and previous Outruns.

51:01.514 --> 51:03.615
[SPEAKER_04]: They're not just repackaging the same crap, right?

51:03.635 --> 51:05.356
[SPEAKER_04]: They're gonna give it a facelift and everything.

51:05.516 --> 51:06.797
[SPEAKER_04]: Bring it to the next gen, right?

51:07.197 --> 51:08.138
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what it sounds like.

51:08.158 --> 51:08.858
[SPEAKER_04]: They're effing better.

51:09.538 --> 51:18.423
[SPEAKER_00]: Um... Also, it says PSP owners who also have the PS2 version will be able to access exclusive content by hooking them up.

51:19.203 --> 51:19.543
[SPEAKER_03]: Ooh!

51:19.704 --> 51:20.964
[SPEAKER_00]: With the USB cable.

51:21.364 --> 51:22.185
[SPEAKER_00]: Finally a use!

51:23.045 --> 51:24.846
[SPEAKER_03]: They actually do that with a lot of games.

51:25.627 --> 51:26.187
[SPEAKER_00]: Do they?

51:26.247 --> 51:26.407
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

51:26.812 --> 51:30.595
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, at any rate, it's being put out in development by Sumo Digital.

51:31.015 --> 51:33.577
[SPEAKER_00]: They actually were the ones who ported Outrun 2 to Xbox.

51:34.058 --> 51:39.822
[SPEAKER_03]: Like WWE, SmackDown vs. Raw 6, SOCOM, Fireteam Bravo, and SOCOM 3.

51:43.745 --> 51:44.105
[SPEAKER_03]: Madden.

51:46.887 --> 51:48.408
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, Loki, I'm about out of stuff.

51:48.428 --> 51:49.449
[SPEAKER_04]: What else you got for us tonight?

51:49.869 --> 51:52.732
[SPEAKER_04]: I know you had something on Metal Gear or something and a pretty cool hack.

51:53.872 --> 51:54.373
[SPEAKER_03]: Metal Gear?

51:54.946 --> 51:57.288
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you say you had something about Metal Gear Acid 2 or something?

51:57.508 --> 51:58.148
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, no.

51:58.188 --> 51:59.169
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, Metal Gear Acid 2.

52:00.230 --> 52:01.250
[SPEAKER_03]: It's actually quite funny.

52:01.430 --> 52:06.494
[SPEAKER_03]: They found out one of the things that's actually featured in the game because someone, of course, dumped the ROM for it.

52:07.314 --> 52:09.856
[SPEAKER_03]: And they discovered videos of... Wait, is the game out?

52:10.256 --> 52:11.177
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, in Japan.

52:11.497 --> 52:11.878
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, okay.

52:12.518 --> 52:19.102
[SPEAKER_03]: Of scantily clad women for use with that special viewing device that they have, the solid eye.

52:19.923 --> 52:23.345
[SPEAKER_03]: So you get 3D video of scantily clad women as well as...

52:25.273 --> 52:27.414
[SPEAKER_03]: A trailer for Rainbow Roses XX, which is kind of cool.

52:27.614 --> 52:27.874
[SPEAKER_03]: Hot.

52:29.214 --> 52:35.497
[SPEAKER_03]: In other news, this is called, you know, it's bound to happen sooner or later.

52:35.597 --> 52:39.918
[SPEAKER_03]: The first 360 game has been dumped to a hard drive.

52:40.918 --> 52:46.200
[SPEAKER_03]: A group going by the name of Pi has released a 360 dump extract tool.

52:46.220 --> 52:50.742
[SPEAKER_03]: They were able to rip apart the games to extract them to their PC's hard drive.

52:51.682 --> 52:53.583
[SPEAKER_03]: Getting the run on the other hand, that's another story.

52:53.663 --> 52:54.123
[SPEAKER_03]: But still...

52:55.652 --> 52:57.252
[SPEAKER_04]: One small step for hackers.

52:57.853 --> 52:58.093
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

52:59.473 --> 53:00.533
[SPEAKER_04]: One giant... forget it.

53:01.453 --> 53:01.754
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyways.

53:03.254 --> 53:04.114
[SPEAKER_03]: So that was interesting.

53:04.274 --> 53:24.539
[SPEAKER_03]: Speaking of more hacking stuff, this guy, actually, going by the name of Parasite, has shown that you can hack levels into your online Wi-Fi for Mario Kart DS, and he's been able to play such levels as the TikTok clock and other stuff.

53:26.223 --> 53:32.055
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think they've released how they've done this yet, but it has been shown and people have been doing it online.

53:32.436 --> 53:33.358
[SPEAKER_03]: It's kind of interesting.

53:33.418 --> 53:35.884
[SPEAKER_03]: Some of the levels kind of glitch out a little bit, but

53:37.622 --> 53:39.563
[SPEAKER_03]: Booby Prize Bike Race Any Tips for Winning?

54:08.154 --> 54:08.534
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

54:08.995 --> 54:11.637
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't actually finish the game or play many of the missions.

54:11.677 --> 54:16.182
[SPEAKER_03]: I just put a 100% code in to get all the characters for multiplayer.

54:16.202 --> 54:16.602
[SPEAKER_04]: Cheater!

54:17.102 --> 54:17.763
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, here's what.

54:17.863 --> 54:19.124
[SPEAKER_03]: I only play it for multiplayer.

54:19.265 --> 54:20.666
[SPEAKER_03]: That's all I play the game for now.

54:20.786 --> 54:23.589
[SPEAKER_03]: So I don't actually play three of the missions and stuff.

54:23.649 --> 54:26.231
[SPEAKER_03]: So I just wanted to have all the characters unlocked and everything.

54:26.531 --> 54:28.573
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't point fingers because I'm cheating at Silent Hill 3.

54:28.613 --> 54:30.735
[SPEAKER_04]: You're going to have to go to GameFAQs, my friend.

54:31.056 --> 54:31.336
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry.

54:31.977 --> 54:33.438
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, GameFAQs would be a good place to check.

54:34.662 --> 54:38.525
[SPEAKER_00]: I did send a very interesting link at themushroomkingdom.net.

54:40.005 --> 54:41.426
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the Super Mario Bros.

54:41.446 --> 54:42.687
[SPEAKER_00]: 3, their lost levels.

54:44.408 --> 54:45.989
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll just read the first paragraph from that page.

54:46.529 --> 54:47.670
[SPEAKER_00]: Deep within Super Mario Bros.

54:47.930 --> 54:49.391
[SPEAKER_00]: 3 lie hidden, unused levels.

54:49.511 --> 54:56.476
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of them seem polished with working goals and plenty of enemies, while others are devoid of enemies, lacking exits or too short to be full levels.

54:57.596 --> 54:58.957
[SPEAKER_00]: There's actually a couple of pictures of them.

54:58.997 --> 54:59.897
[SPEAKER_00]: One of them uses the boot.

55:00.737 --> 55:01.217
[SPEAKER_00]: I love the boot.

55:01.237 --> 55:04.198
[SPEAKER_04]: That's great because only like one level in the actual game used the boot.

55:04.498 --> 55:05.538
[SPEAKER_04]: And it was so short.

55:05.978 --> 55:06.679
[SPEAKER_04]: And the boot was cool.

55:07.079 --> 55:09.759
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's pretty cool because the level maps are up on the page.

55:09.839 --> 55:14.781
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd say people should check it out if you're an old school Super Mario Brothers player.

55:14.801 --> 55:16.781
[SPEAKER_00]: But you know, that actually goes back into what we were saying.

55:16.821 --> 55:19.782
[SPEAKER_00]: There's always unused code in games.

55:20.102 --> 55:26.104
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I mean, this could have easily been Mario Hot Coffee where Mario and the princess get it on.

55:28.120 --> 55:29.241
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

55:58.354 --> 56:00.376
[SPEAKER_00]: No, not, no.

56:00.736 --> 56:01.797
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki, anything else?

56:02.338 --> 56:07.322
[SPEAKER_03]: I just have one more, and that's this product has been released.

56:08.383 --> 56:13.127
[SPEAKER_03]: Basically, it's on this website, gameback-web.com.

56:13.507 --> 56:14.488
[SPEAKER_03]: It's in their web store.

56:14.588 --> 56:15.769
[SPEAKER_03]: It's called the PSP Bank.

56:15.849 --> 56:18.712
[SPEAKER_03]: It's basically a 40 gigabyte hard drive for the PSP.

56:19.652 --> 56:24.977
[SPEAKER_03]: What it looks actually to be is a PSP, it's a hard drive that has a USB on the go.

56:25.444 --> 56:28.446
[SPEAKER_03]: so you can actually transfer stuff between the hard drive and the PSP.

56:28.987 --> 56:32.509
[SPEAKER_03]: However, you can't actually just access the entire hard drive using the PSP.

56:33.670 --> 56:37.193
[SPEAKER_03]: So, not quite cool, but a step in the right direction, I guess.

56:37.593 --> 56:43.237
[SPEAKER_03]: And also, there was another development here, which is quite interesting.

56:43.958 --> 56:48.141
[SPEAKER_03]: The guy that's basically behind... Oh, what was it here?

56:50.262 --> 56:53.865
[SPEAKER_03]: Who's behind the cheat device for Grand Theft Auto, or

56:54.684 --> 56:56.326
[SPEAKER_03]: They think it's actually done the same way.

56:57.087 --> 57:05.738
[SPEAKER_03]: Basically working on running firmware on 2.01 and 2.5 firmware, so maybe 2.6 running the homebrew stuff.

57:06.979 --> 57:09.923
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's being worked on and probably cracked soon.

57:12.830 --> 57:17.235
[SPEAKER_04]: One more story I got for you guys, and that has to do... I knew Jamie would get a kick out of this one.

57:17.816 --> 57:22.421
[SPEAKER_04]: I went to Slashdot earlier this week, and I saw this, and I totally thought of you, Jamie.

57:23.122 --> 57:25.985
[SPEAKER_04]: The headline is, Gamers Better at Driving with Cell Phones?

57:27.822 --> 57:28.943
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, you know what?

57:29.343 --> 57:30.484
[SPEAKER_04]: Hold on, I haven't read it yet.

57:31.805 --> 57:32.165
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see.

57:33.466 --> 57:39.770
[SPEAKER_04]: These psychologists who are studying multitasking have argued for years about these information bottlenecks, and they want to know why this occurs.

57:39.810 --> 57:41.031
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it because people are lazy?

57:41.431 --> 57:43.813
[SPEAKER_04]: Because they have an inability to switch from one task to another?

57:44.193 --> 57:44.573
[SPEAKER_04]: Who knows?

57:44.653 --> 57:50.377
[SPEAKER_04]: But this Mei-Chang Lin, who is an assistant professor of psychology at Oregon State University, said...

57:52.427 --> 57:59.014
[SPEAKER_04]: Even with a seemingly simple task, structural cognitive limitations can prevent you from efficiently switching to a new task.

57:59.595 --> 58:03.920
[SPEAKER_04]: I have to say that the best ones are those who play a lot of video games, she pointed out.

58:04.878 --> 58:06.979
[SPEAKER_04]: Those are lab studies, however, not driving tests.

58:08.660 --> 58:10.521
[SPEAKER_04]: So because you play video games, you're good at multitasking.

58:10.541 --> 58:16.085
[SPEAKER_04]: So therefore, gamers, throw those headsets away because you can multitask.

58:16.165 --> 58:16.985
[SPEAKER_00]: I've said it once.

58:17.626 --> 58:19.247
[SPEAKER_00]: I've said it a bajillion times.

58:19.907 --> 58:21.988
[SPEAKER_00]: And somebody in this room is included in that.

58:22.609 --> 58:26.151
[SPEAKER_00]: If you drive and talk on your cell phone, you are being a big dumb butt.

58:27.031 --> 58:29.433
[SPEAKER_00]: You are endangering your life and those of other people.

58:30.106 --> 58:31.647
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm multitasking, what can I say?

58:32.067 --> 58:34.089
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, it's impossible to multitask.

58:34.609 --> 58:35.910
[SPEAKER_04]: I can multitask.

58:36.290 --> 58:36.930
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm a good driver.

58:38.011 --> 58:38.791
[SPEAKER_04]: Final thoughts.

58:39.852 --> 58:41.033
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki, your final thought.

58:41.133 --> 58:41.693
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to get better.

58:43.534 --> 58:45.936
[SPEAKER_04]: My final thought is I hate being sick.

58:46.496 --> 58:47.037
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura?

58:48.818 --> 58:50.159
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm tired of having the plague.

58:50.199 --> 58:51.920
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been sick since November 4th.

58:52.780 --> 58:53.981
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think I'm ever going to get better.

58:55.868 --> 58:57.870
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, that's a happy note to end episode 50 on.

58:57.950 --> 59:01.313
[SPEAKER_04]: So, congratulations, we made it through 50 episodes.

59:01.493 --> 59:01.993
[SPEAKER_04]: Yay!

59:03.194 --> 59:04.936
[SPEAKER_04]: Here we come to 51 next week.

59:04.976 --> 59:05.536
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll see you then.

59:06.177 --> 59:08.119
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, you know who we haven't heard from all episode?

59:10.661 --> 59:11.221
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, God.

59:11.922 --> 59:13.723
[SPEAKER_00]: One of our very special hosts.

59:14.104 --> 59:14.364
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

59:16.306 --> 59:16.726
[SPEAKER_04]: The ferret.

59:17.887 --> 59:18.327
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for that.

59:18.427 --> 59:21.470
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, by the way, episode 51, we will be burning the ferret live on air.

59:21.490 --> 59:22.291
[SPEAKER_00]: No, we will not!

59:23.393 --> 59:24.073
[SPEAKER_04]: See you next time.

59:24.113 --> 59:28.856
[SPEAKER_04]: Tell a friend about Orange Lounge Radio to go and make our ratings go through the roof because we like attention.

59:29.036 --> 59:29.236
[SPEAKER_04]: Bye.

59:31.217 --> 59:34.778
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the end of another Orange Lounge Radio to go edition.

59:35.079 --> 59:42.042
[SPEAKER_02]: This podcast is a proud part of www.orangeloungeradio.com See you next update.
