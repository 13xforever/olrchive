00:18.500 --> 00:23.500
Hello, everybody. Once again, and welcome to Orange Lounge Radio To Go,

00:23.500 --> 00:27.500
your home for discussion on video games, video game news,

00:27.500 --> 00:33.780
Video game discussion about games that don't suck but sometimes we do have to talk about games that do suck just to tell you to

00:33.780 --> 00:40.740
Avoid them tonight is episode 50 of our podcast. Yay. Yeah means 50 weeks in a row. We've been here

00:41.340 --> 00:46.700
Podcasting is that new it's only been around like a little bit in a year, you know, so it's kind of cool

00:47.500 --> 00:50.320
So we're just a couple weeks from a one-year anniversary. Of course that means

00:50.320 --> 00:55.320
With me, as always, is the one and only Dark Sakura.

00:55.320 --> 00:56.320
Hi.

00:56.320 --> 00:57.320
How you doing?

00:57.320 --> 00:59.320
My voice keeps coming and going.

00:59.320 --> 01:02.320
I still have the plague.

01:02.320 --> 01:04.320
I do still have the plague.

01:04.320 --> 01:10.320
It sucks because I've learned that lung cookies really are not a delicacy.

01:10.320 --> 01:11.320
I see.

01:11.320 --> 01:14.320
Also with us, say hello to the one and only Loki.

01:14.320 --> 01:15.320
Hello.

01:15.320 --> 01:16.320
How you doing?

01:16.320 --> 01:17.320
I'm quite stuffed up.

01:17.320 --> 01:21.520
And I'm also sick so you know what that means all three of us are sick

01:21.920 --> 01:25.280
We all have I don't think we all have the plague, but we all have something bad

01:25.280 --> 01:26.940
I know it's it's horrible

01:26.940 --> 01:32.120
We had to cancel our live show this week cuz we both have the micro plague maybe mini plague mini place

01:32.120 --> 01:37.020
I shall call it mini plague. I don't know but it's sucks, but

01:38.320 --> 01:42.240
We weren't gonna call in sick for episode 50 this would happen to us on like a landmark

01:42.960 --> 01:45.140
style show to us so

01:45.140 --> 01:50.860
So, anyway, let's get into it, same shtick as always, what kind of stuff you been playing

01:50.860 --> 01:51.860
this week?

01:51.860 --> 01:52.860
Dark Sakura.

01:52.860 --> 01:55.460
Um, Animal Crossing.

01:55.460 --> 02:01.220
I've been playing with my villagers and hitting you in the head with a net, and hitting people

02:01.220 --> 02:06.020
I don't know in your village with a net, and I stubbed you in the toe with my shovel.

02:06.020 --> 02:08.620
And you also planted a pitfall that I fell into, thank you.

02:08.620 --> 02:12.620
I planted one for myself so that I could fall into it right in front of you to make you

02:12.620 --> 02:13.700
feel better.

02:13.700 --> 02:16.600
But you got out of it before I was able to get my bug net out and start whacking you

02:16.600 --> 02:17.600
while you were in the hole.

02:17.600 --> 02:19.600
So, it made me sad.

02:19.600 --> 02:20.600
It's alright.

02:20.600 --> 02:23.880
This is me giving you a flat look that our listeners can't hear.

02:23.880 --> 02:26.940
Great radio.

02:26.940 --> 02:32.680
I also have been watching Dan play a lot of that game that I'm getting really bored of

02:32.680 --> 02:38.760
watching, the Project Gotham Racing 3, because it looks like the cars are still floating

03:08.760 --> 03:15.760
Okay, I've been playing Animal Crossing, which is fun, and I've been playing a little bit

03:16.800 --> 03:23.800
Need for Speed, or not Need for Speed, Ridge Racer 6, because that's cool. I've been playing

03:24.800 --> 03:29.760
also very, very little of Project Gotham, because I kind of suck at that game, and Amp

03:29.760 --> 03:35.680
3. Amp 3 is really fun. Yes, and I finally got my 360 because I had to go buy it from

03:35.680 --> 03:41.680
somebody who is charging an exorbitant amount of money for it, but you know what, I'm satisfied.

03:41.680 --> 03:45.680
Shame! You know what? It's all Microsoft's fault.

03:45.680 --> 03:48.680
Our listeners can't see me pointing and laughing.

03:48.680 --> 03:51.680
I don't know. You let me down, Loki. No, it's...

03:51.680 --> 03:55.680
You know, you gotta do what makes you happy, and if that's really what makes you happy,

03:55.680 --> 03:58.680
is one of those big white paperweights, then...

03:58.680 --> 04:03.680
Let me put it this way, okay? I checked back with my GameStop to see what they've got, dude.

04:03.680 --> 04:11.180
see okay maybe mine will come okay I was about 48 on the list or something like

04:11.180 --> 04:17.700
that that's after you know I pre-ordered that back in August so anyways they have

04:17.700 --> 04:28.580
gotten in in the I know three weeks or so since the launch to that is it to at

04:28.580 --> 04:33.540
at that rate my 360 would arrive in february

04:33.540 --> 04:36.680
so now didn't you get a tip that a bunch of Best Buy's are getting a bunch more

04:36.680 --> 04:38.180
360's on a particular day

04:38.180 --> 04:41.940
yeah I don't want to wait in line, I don't want to wait early in the morning in line for this stuff

04:41.940 --> 04:45.860
well what about our listeners who might want to know the tip

04:45.860 --> 04:50.700
well there's going to be a lot of 360's arriving at Best Buy for their

04:50.700 --> 04:53.940
their December 18th sale they're gonna have

04:53.940 --> 04:58.340
at least 20 per store some a lot more than that

04:58.340 --> 05:02.220
and you can actually find, there's a whole list I posted in my live journal.

05:02.220 --> 05:05.900
Where did you figure this out? Because the list you got looked really official.

05:05.900 --> 05:09.620
It's on GameFAQs. Someone had posted a list that

05:09.620 --> 05:13.420
I guess is off of a printout or something. But anyways,

05:13.420 --> 05:17.660
basically most of the stores, like in our area, were getting 24 per store. One of them was

05:17.660 --> 05:18.580
getting 30

05:18.580 --> 05:22.380
or 40 I think, but that's about it, yeah.

05:22.380 --> 05:26.180
So if you want one, you better be waiting in line again.

05:26.180 --> 05:29.260
like the launch all over again which I find funny because

05:29.260 --> 05:33.140
Best Buy is getting, what, like, tons of these 360s

05:33.140 --> 05:37.860
and GameStop is getting two. What the hell?

05:37.860 --> 05:42.660
Well that's because for every Best Buy there's like 20 GameStops at least in this area.

05:42.660 --> 05:46.220
It's ridiculous. But anyways, the whole thing

05:46.220 --> 05:50.340
is just, it's a big ripoff. Before you go buy your 360

05:50.340 --> 05:54.140
take a good look at what accessories you need and how much those are gonna cost.

05:54.140 --> 05:56.140
Let me tell you this much I

05:56.340 --> 06:02.040
Ended up using my entire pre-order amount of money on the 360 that I had on there

06:02.740 --> 06:07.140
$430 on accessories that is how much their fucking accessories cost

06:08.220 --> 06:15.840
Okay, those controllers $50 each for the wireless ones those you know component cables try $40 for stupid cables

06:15.840 --> 06:19.860
I mean, it's ridiculous. And if you get a core system, good luck. I

06:19.860 --> 06:25.040
I do understand that someone went into, I think it was at my husband's store

06:25.040 --> 06:28.820
and dropped three grand on his platinum

06:28.820 --> 06:33.980
360 with controllers and games. Wow.

06:33.980 --> 06:37.460
I don't feel sorry for them one bit. For them

06:37.460 --> 06:40.940
losing, oh poor things losing $140

06:40.940 --> 06:44.700
per system they sell, oh don't fucking care

06:44.700 --> 06:47.860
okay. I mean even, I had

06:47.860 --> 06:52.460
they get a core system is the one I got and it has composite cables with it

06:52.460 --> 06:56.360
composite cables do have S-video on them, you have to buy separate cables which are

06:56.360 --> 06:57.120
thirty dollars

06:57.120 --> 07:00.320
way more than any other cables I've seen but

07:00.320 --> 07:04.400
for S-video it's pretty ridiculous

07:04.400 --> 07:07.720
but I might add though composite does still look really good for the system

07:07.720 --> 07:12.920
that's pretty good for if you have really shitty TV I don't think you need

07:12.920 --> 07:16.560
anything better than composite unless you're running an HDTV or like a

07:16.560 --> 07:18.560
computer monitor or something.

07:18.560 --> 07:22.560
The only thing that you will run into is the text is hard to read if you don't have S-video or something like that.

07:22.560 --> 07:24.560
That's it.

07:24.560 --> 07:26.560
So what are your impressions of Xbox 360?

07:26.560 --> 07:27.560
I like it.

07:27.560 --> 07:29.560
Is it worth all the money you poured into it?

07:29.560 --> 07:38.560
Well, yeah, because I'm going to use it a lot in my, you know, here and with my job at work and stuff, so it is worth it in that sense.

07:38.560 --> 07:43.560
And I was going to pick it up at some point, and I mean, other people have done the same, you know, they spent money on it.

07:43.560 --> 07:48.720
And I just, I don't see, I had like six games waiting for the system, I just didn't want

07:48.720 --> 07:52.760
to wait another two months to be able to not play these games or whatever.

07:52.760 --> 08:00.360
But so far, you know, I like it, it's pretty fun, it's definitely a pretty good game system.

08:00.360 --> 08:04.160
Project Gotham, though, is more to like Gran Turismo than me, and I don't really like

08:04.160 --> 08:08.440
Gran Turismo, but it is still pretty, you know, it's a nice game.

08:08.440 --> 08:09.520
But I don't know.

08:09.520 --> 08:12.560
I'm hoping that most of these games that come out, because I haven't played a lot of the

08:12.560 --> 08:18.440
games yet, um, aren't just all pretty graphics and horrible gameplay.

08:18.440 --> 08:20.680
Did you get a chance to play Perfect Dark Zero yet?

08:20.680 --> 08:21.580
Not yet.

08:21.580 --> 08:23.680
It actually is pretty worthwhile.

08:23.680 --> 08:28.420
Yeah, I don't know, you know, um, assuming you're done with your, should be all in your

08:28.420 --> 08:31.440
week and kind of moving into my game of the week, because you brought over the 360 tonight

08:31.440 --> 08:35.040
and you were checking it out a little bit, um, I don't know if I saw anything that made

08:35.040 --> 08:38.280
me go, wow, I gotta have this system, like, right now.

08:38.280 --> 08:41.560
You know, granted the games I saw, well, Project Gotham looked probably the best out of the

08:41.560 --> 08:46.240
you showed me, I think Project Gotham looked the best, but I don't know, it just seemed

08:46.240 --> 08:51.360
like all it was was stuff that the Xbox could do, but now supporting HDTV, and I'm thinking,

08:51.360 --> 08:57.400
you know, I'm lucky to have a 30 something inch HDTV, if I didn't have that, I don't

08:57.400 --> 09:02.000
think the game would look that much better than the regular Xbox, or a computer monitor

09:02.000 --> 09:05.520
or something else to hook it up to that can support the higher end textures, so I don't

09:05.520 --> 09:10.920
know, I'm not sure I kind of get it yet, but maybe when some other games come out, because

09:10.920 --> 09:12.920
Because I'm definitely looking forward to some of the upcoming games.

09:12.920 --> 09:18.920
I think there are some definitely better games coming out, like for example Ghost Recon and

09:18.920 --> 09:19.920
Advanced Warfighter.

09:19.920 --> 09:20.920
That game looks amazing.

09:20.920 --> 09:25.240
Just graphically it's amazing the detail that's in the game, just like with the systems and

09:25.240 --> 09:26.640
the weapons you use.

09:26.640 --> 09:27.640
It's really good.

09:27.640 --> 09:29.920
I kind of think at this point they should have just waited.

09:29.920 --> 09:30.920
I don't...

09:30.920 --> 09:31.920
They should have.

09:31.920 --> 09:35.260
I understand why they, you know, were trying to rush for Christmas.

09:35.260 --> 09:38.880
They have become the talked about item for Christmas, which is what they wanted, but

09:38.880 --> 09:39.880
at what price?

09:39.880 --> 09:40.880
At what price?

09:40.880 --> 09:45.780
I think they've really fucked up this whole launch and a lot of people are definitely

09:45.780 --> 09:46.780
pissed off at them.

09:46.780 --> 09:50.460
I mean, granted, some people aren't gonna care and they're still gonna get their 360,

09:50.460 --> 09:54.020
but some of them are saying, you know, fuck this, I'm gonna wait for the PS3.

09:54.020 --> 09:57.880
And I mean, even if that is a small percentage, that's still your core customers you're losing

09:57.880 --> 09:59.840
because you chose to do this.

09:59.840 --> 10:02.180
I don't know, don't you think though that with the right game those people would come

10:02.180 --> 10:04.140
back to play Devil's Advocate a little bit?

10:04.140 --> 10:08.020
Don't you think with the right game coming out in the future, you know, especially, you

10:08.020 --> 10:13.000
what is it the Xbox 360 lacks right now? Role-playing games, right? Let's say that, you know, with

10:13.000 --> 10:15.940
all these developments that some of the folks that were working for Square are going over

10:15.940 --> 10:19.100
to make games for the 360, starting their own company, when some of these games come

10:19.100 --> 10:23.520
out, that's going to make the 360 a hell of a lot more desirable, no matter how bad their

10:23.520 --> 10:24.520
launch was.

10:24.520 --> 10:29.140
With all the pencils coming out for the PS3, and all that stuff too, I mean, it's...

10:29.140 --> 10:40.460
Microsoft did, you know, get support from Sega, Tetsuya Mizuguchi, Sakaguchi, Okamoto,

10:40.460 --> 10:45.340
all the big, some of the big guys that were with Square, Capcom.

10:45.340 --> 10:49.060
Yeah, so it's interesting to see what's going to be coming up in the future.

10:49.060 --> 10:50.060
I don't know.

10:50.060 --> 10:54.560
I just think, although this launch might be screwy, I think people, and people are talking

10:54.560 --> 10:57.340
shit now, I think people are going to overlook it in a year.

10:57.340 --> 11:01.020
But you're right, it really depends on the strength of the PS3, but hopefully Sony's

11:01.020 --> 11:03.940
taking notes and they'll have enough chips when they're ready to go.

11:03.940 --> 11:08.840
Well hopefully it comes down to let's not all launch, worldwide launch was dumb.

11:08.840 --> 11:09.840
It was really dumb.

11:09.840 --> 11:15.100
And they didn't truly launch worldwide, they launched in three major markets, the three

11:15.100 --> 11:16.100
biggest ones.

11:16.100 --> 11:19.460
You split up your systems and you have shortages in three countries, I don't call that worldwide

11:19.460 --> 11:20.460
launch.

11:20.460 --> 11:22.340
I call that, oh I shipped some of my units to someplace else.

11:22.340 --> 11:23.340
Yeah, good point.

11:23.340 --> 11:26.780
Alright, anyway, as far as other games I played this week, of course Animal Crossing is big

11:26.780 --> 11:30.720
news and I've checked out Animal Crossing you know it's very similar to

11:30.720 --> 11:35.220
the GameCube version it I kind of call it Animal Crossing Plus because it's

11:35.220 --> 11:37.740
very very similar to the GameCube version but with like new items and new

11:37.740 --> 11:42.780
stuff and new things to do. That's ironic. Why is that? Cuz double to nomori on

11:42.780 --> 11:48.900
GameCube was double to nomori plus. Yeah yeah. The first one was on Nintendo 64.

11:48.900 --> 11:53.180
Animal Forest Plus basically. It still looks like a Nintendo 64 game. It does but

11:53.180 --> 11:58.900
that's okay because... It's a scrolly land. Yeah, you know, the land is different but it makes it

11:58.900 --> 12:02.340
nice, makes it that seamless, you know, feeling to it. It sounds like the

12:02.340 --> 12:07.460
objectives take longer and of course the Wi-Fi is is pretty cool. The first couple

12:07.460 --> 12:10.300
days were rough. I was getting a lot of communication errors those first two

12:10.300 --> 12:13.460
days but it's calmed down a lot. I've had a lot of people in and out of my village.

12:13.460 --> 12:18.280
What can I say? I'm an Animal Crossing whore. And it's been good. Overall, the

12:18.280 --> 12:21.660
experience has been pretty good. Sometimes it can be really slow with that

12:21.660 --> 12:25.980
Wi-Fi stuff, not that you get lag, but that when somebody comes into your village,

12:25.980 --> 12:30.140
save, wait, here they come, save, you know,

12:30.140 --> 12:34.020
it's a pretty slow process, but overall, you know, can't complain.

12:34.020 --> 12:38.280
It certainly adds so much more to the game when you don't have to be taking a

12:38.280 --> 12:40.280
physical memory card over to somebody else's house.

12:40.280 --> 12:43.300
If you enjoyed Animal Crossing on the GameCube, you will

12:43.300 --> 12:47.980
enjoy this on the DS. I think you'll kind of find that you're kind of rediscovering

12:47.980 --> 12:50.100
what you liked about Animal Crossing 1 all over again. My

12:50.100 --> 12:53.920
fear about this game is that it's gonna be another Nintendogs that in in two

12:53.920 --> 12:57.420
weeks none of us will be playing it anymore after we all pay off our houses

12:57.420 --> 12:59.860
that was a problem with Animal Crossing 1 after everybody paid off their house

12:59.860 --> 13:06.920
bye game and I don't know I it's difficult to say at this point but it's

13:06.920 --> 13:10.820
also you know not trying to collect all the retro Nintendo games anymore yeah

13:10.820 --> 13:13.980
you don't have that anymore people who still tend to their GameCube houses I

13:13.980 --> 13:17.500
know and there's always gonna be babysitting my village there's gonna be

13:17.500 --> 13:22.340
the hardcore, you know, people, but for the average gamer, I think they're going to move

13:22.340 --> 13:26.340
on after a couple weeks. I just have this bad feeling it's going to be another Nintendogs.

13:26.340 --> 13:29.460
I don't know, I think it'll last longer than Nintendogs, because I think there's more to

13:29.460 --> 13:34.620
do, but I just, I don't know, I don't see this thrill lasting, especially with, you

13:34.620 --> 13:37.640
know, games that are going to be coming out in January, February. I think this was a good

13:37.640 --> 13:41.980
time for the game to come out, but I don't know, I just don't see the honeymoon lasting

13:41.980 --> 13:43.700
forever with Animal Crossing.

13:43.700 --> 13:45.900
I think it's going to stick around for a little while.

13:45.900 --> 13:46.900
We'll see.

13:46.900 --> 13:49.900
See, ever since I got Animal Crossing, I haven't touched Mario Kart.

13:49.900 --> 13:52.900
I'll probably go back to that, though.

13:52.900 --> 13:58.660
Anyway, let's talk about some gaming news, what's going on in the gaming world, and since

13:58.660 --> 14:02.740
we've been talking Xbox 360, let's talk about the launch in Japan, which happened.

14:02.740 --> 14:07.500
Yes, they launched the Xbox 360 in Japan this past week, and of course it's the last of

14:07.500 --> 14:11.040
the three major companies they're launching this in.

14:11.040 --> 14:17.220
What's interesting though, not quite the same lines that you saw here in America.

14:17.220 --> 14:23.260
Over 250 people waiting in line at Sutaya, which is where this big countdown event was,

14:23.260 --> 14:28.820
but when you went to other stores around, Yodobashi Akiba, which is a big superstore

14:28.820 --> 14:34.540
in Tokyo, only 21 people lined up before 7 a.m., which is nothing compared to the lines

14:34.540 --> 14:35.820
they had here.

14:35.820 --> 14:41.500
But of course, Microsoft is not calling this a failure yet in Japan, and I think a lot

14:41.500 --> 14:45.820
of, you know, you can really tell who the MS fanboys and the anti-MS fanboys are because,

14:45.820 --> 14:50.580
you know, I'm sure the anti-Microsoft people are quick to jump on this and say, oops, my

14:50.580 --> 14:51.580
mic went out again.

14:51.580 --> 14:55.900
The anti-Microsoft people are quick to jump on this and say, oh, they failed, the Xbox

14:55.900 --> 14:57.540
360 failed in Japan.

14:57.540 --> 14:59.500
I don't know.

14:59.500 --> 15:04.300
I've been pretty critical of Microsoft in the past, stupid mic, I've been pretty critical

15:04.300 --> 15:08.460
of Microsoft in the past, but I don't say just because they had a slower launch, don't

15:08.460 --> 15:09.460
count them out.

15:09.460 --> 15:13.900
Again, we were just talking about, you know, the big games are going to be coming out later

15:13.900 --> 15:18.500
next year, and what are the games that Japanese gamers really want that aren't out on the

15:18.500 --> 15:20.420
Xbox 360 at all right now?

15:20.420 --> 15:21.620
Enchanted Arm.

15:21.620 --> 15:23.500
RPGs in general.

15:23.500 --> 15:25.660
And I'm sorry, Cameo does not count.

15:25.660 --> 15:26.660
It's a platformer.

15:26.660 --> 15:27.660
Yeah.

15:27.660 --> 15:30.140
So, don't count it out in Japan yet.

15:30.140 --> 15:34.420
Wait and see what happens when the dudes from Final Fantasy put out their game on the Xbox

15:34.420 --> 15:36.060
360 or whatever it is they're planning.

15:36.060 --> 15:38.180
Wait and see how that does or doesn't do.

15:38.180 --> 15:40.700
That's the true indication of how the system's going to do, I think.

15:40.700 --> 15:43.260
Jamie, you have kind of a follow-up on that?

15:43.260 --> 15:47.620
Well, yeah, just a lot of the market analysts in Japan are really, really down on it, saying

15:47.620 --> 15:48.620
that...

15:48.620 --> 15:54.580
In fact, there's a quote on here saying that they previously thought the Xbox 360 would

15:54.580 --> 16:02.700
gain a major share of Japanese market by taking some of the share from Sony, but now that

16:02.700 --> 16:07.100
prospect might not be realized given the limited attractiveness of its titles and lukewarm

16:07.100 --> 16:08.100
functions.

16:08.100 --> 16:10.180
That last part's a direct quote.

16:10.180 --> 16:21.420
However, they were saying, actually according of a survey at the CESA that, I'm sorry I'm

16:21.420 --> 16:22.420
getting tongue tied.

16:22.420 --> 16:28.360
That's why we're all feeling it tonight. Yeah CSA survey at the Tokyo game show was saying that

16:28.840 --> 16:34.840
23% of the consumers won an Xbox 360 compared to under 21% interested in the revolution

16:35.440 --> 16:38.880
But see the thing that gets me is that all these analysts are talking about Oh

16:39.600 --> 16:41.600
PlayStation 3 PlayStation 3 they're comparing

16:42.280 --> 16:48.080
They're basically comparing what exists to what might exist. I mean

16:48.080 --> 16:53.760
we've seen the demo the tech I'm sure all of us will saw a lot of the demo

16:53.760 --> 16:57.800
stuff you know those out on the internet now for the PlayStation 3 and I went

16:57.800 --> 17:03.440
into that pretty little show they had at e3 but honestly don't count your

17:03.440 --> 17:07.480
chickens for their hatched same with Nintendo because Nintendo is you know

17:07.480 --> 17:13.920
they're taking what's always been oranges and making apples now at least

17:13.920 --> 17:17.960
it's what they say you know the revolution and everything gonna be not

17:17.960 --> 17:21.320
literally making apples we don't know that they've teamed up yet but um you

17:21.320 --> 17:24.320
know it's certainly interesting because Nintendo it almost sounds like wants to

17:24.320 --> 17:27.760
go off in this entire other direction they're like you know screw specs we've

17:27.760 --> 17:33.760
got something better I don't know I glanced over an article a few days ago

17:33.760 --> 17:38.080
where MTV got their hands on a revolution to try it out I don't

17:38.080 --> 17:43.680
remember the name overly I'm sure they gave the revolution the plague Loki you

17:43.680 --> 17:46.400
have some more information about some interesting developments on the

17:46.400 --> 17:49.160
Revolution some type of patent or something going on there yeah the

17:49.160 --> 17:55.000
revolution they've got basically these pens for its two patents for displacement

17:55.000 --> 18:04.200
mapping it's basically a technique used to kind of ease rendering 3d and 2d and

18:04.200 --> 18:09.780
what they've done is the first patent is actually about the you know displacement

18:09.780 --> 18:15.360
mapping itself the actual rendering and the second is on a technique that uses

18:15.360 --> 18:19.240
basically less of the CPU to render this stuff, to make

18:19.240 --> 18:23.360
basically their less powerful system just as powerful

18:23.360 --> 18:27.840
is basically what it is. So my big question is does this support your theory that

18:27.840 --> 18:30.480
the revolution, your ongoing theory throughout our past few episodes, that the

18:30.480 --> 18:31.800
revolution is 3D?

18:31.800 --> 18:38.720
I can't even think of the term now. Stereoscopic 3D? Yes, thank you, stereostereoscopic 3D, I hate being sick.

18:38.720 --> 18:43.240
It doesn't really add to anything, it's basically saying that it can render stuff a lot faster.

18:43.240 --> 18:48.880
I have some news over on PlayStation 3.

18:48.880 --> 18:52.080
People are saying that there's no way in hell PlayStation 3 is going to launch in spring,

18:52.080 --> 18:55.140
and Sony reassured this week, yes, they will.

18:55.140 --> 18:58.320
They will be releasing in the spring.

18:58.320 --> 19:04.200
Maybe not in the U.S. though, but they will release in the spring, at least in Japan.

19:04.200 --> 19:07.040
Very interesting.

19:07.040 --> 19:10.960
It seems like there's this huge, still kind of question mark with the PlayStation 3.

19:10.960 --> 19:12.320
There's still a lot about it we don't know.

19:12.320 --> 19:16.680
spring is not that far away so it'll be interesting if this machine really does

19:16.680 --> 19:23.760
launch in the spring but you know I'd like to see it be interesting you know

19:23.760 --> 19:31.040
it's gonna be sort of like I think the ps2 was be released be buggy as hell be

19:31.040 --> 19:35.520
released you know I although amazingly enough I actually have a very first

19:35.520 --> 19:40.680
model Japanese ps2 with has never had a problem you would think too that they

19:40.680 --> 19:44.400
learn from their previous mistakes. You'd hope. And that they're looking at what's

19:44.400 --> 19:47.480
going on with Microsoft and maybe saying, how can we prevent this? At least I hope.

19:47.480 --> 19:50.920
I hope everybody's looking at this. Unless they put more work into it than they've

19:50.920 --> 19:57.120
been vocal about. We'll see. Speaking of 360, Loki, you had a story about

19:57.120 --> 20:02.800
basically Microsoft has come out and admitted why. Well, the 360 supposedly is

20:02.800 --> 20:08.240
short, according to Microsoft, is because of a shortage of chips or a certain chip

20:08.240 --> 20:13.460
that was actually needed for the 360, and because the production of this chip is not

20:13.460 --> 20:19.500
quite at what they want, the 360s haven't been able to be made.

20:19.500 --> 20:26.980
Basically the yields are too low and they're outrunning the supply of the systems.

20:26.980 --> 20:32.460
And what they've said, though, is they're not going to be able to get back up to where

20:32.460 --> 20:39.160
they need to be until, like, February, which is another reason why I bought my system when

20:39.160 --> 20:40.160
I could.

20:40.160 --> 20:43.320
So basically, if you don't have a pre-order, don't count on it until February, unless you're

20:43.320 --> 20:45.000
going to be camping out or something.

20:45.000 --> 20:48.880
It's going to be very hard to get lunch.

20:48.880 --> 20:53.940
Speaking of the 360, their backwards compatibility has been upgraded a little bit.

20:53.940 --> 20:57.200
They actually added support for a bunch of new games.

20:57.200 --> 20:59.360
They said they all fall in the same family.

20:59.360 --> 21:04.680
If you own any Tom Clancy game from the Xbox, pretty much, whether it be Ghost Recon, 2,

21:04.680 --> 21:09.500
Summit Strike, Rainbow Six, Splinter Cell, it all now will work on your Xbox 360.

21:09.500 --> 21:10.500
Thanks, dude.

21:10.500 --> 21:11.500
Backward compatibility.

21:11.500 --> 21:14.800
Yeah, it's funny, it was when they initially released this, it broke Halo 2.

21:14.800 --> 21:18.360
Then they had to recall the patch and then they fixed it.

21:18.360 --> 21:19.360
Oh, I didn't know about that.

21:19.360 --> 21:20.360
Yeah, it was funny.

21:20.360 --> 21:24.240
We were playing Halo on our 360 while I was actually watching Dan play it.

21:24.240 --> 21:26.760
Does it really look better?

21:26.760 --> 21:27.760
Not noticeably.

21:27.760 --> 21:28.760
Hmm.

21:28.760 --> 21:48.760
We played it on the Xbox plenty of times that I'm pretty familiar with what it looks like on my TV, and it did look a little more smooth, but it really wasn't a perceptible notice unless you were really looking for it.

21:48.760 --> 21:57.760
Let's go ahead and move on now and talk a little bit about real life, because there is a big world out there outside of video games.

21:57.760 --> 22:05.760
And you know, if we stayed indoors and played video games all day long, we would have no time to go outside and whack people over the head with bug nets for real.

22:05.760 --> 22:11.760
So, DarkSakura is here to remind you that there is a big world out there, and she brings you her advice column.

22:11.760 --> 22:14.760
DarkSakura, what are you going to be telling the kids about this week?

22:14.760 --> 22:19.760
Today's bit of advice is how to survive if you're trapped in a walk-in freezer.

22:19.760 --> 22:22.760
Wait, wasn't that an episode of Clerks, the cartoon?

22:22.760 --> 22:23.760
Yes, it was.

22:23.760 --> 22:24.760
Oh, awesome.

22:24.760 --> 22:26.760
Where it had Dante wearing the diapers saying,

22:26.760 --> 22:30.760
I'm the biggest dumbass in the world.

22:30.760 --> 22:35.760
Anyway, number one, tap several times on the door to get someone's attention.

22:35.760 --> 22:40.760
Two, check the door and lock area.

22:40.760 --> 22:45.760
By law, all walk-in freezers must have an emergency release switch on the interior.

22:45.760 --> 22:49.760
3. Locate a power switch. Some units may have an accessible on-off switch.

22:49.760 --> 22:51.760
Turn off the cooling element.

22:51.760 --> 22:53.760
That would be gross.

22:53.760 --> 22:55.760
What if you're in there with meat?

22:55.760 --> 22:59.760
They turn it on every now and then to keep it nice and cool, but not too cold.

22:59.760 --> 23:01.760
You'd come out smelling like meat.

23:01.760 --> 23:02.760
Like rancid.

23:02.760 --> 23:07.760
4. Locate boxes. Tear cardboard boxes apart and spread them on the floor.

23:07.760 --> 23:09.760
5. Look for-

23:09.760 --> 23:12.920
See insolation? Oh, that's smart.

23:12.920 --> 23:16.600
See, I'd die. I'd die. I'd see the picture. I'd die in the damn freezer.

23:16.600 --> 23:19.880
I heard people sleep in boxes. Oh, okay. That makes sense. Thanks.

23:19.880 --> 23:25.160
4. Look for insulating materials. Lie down on the cardboard and cover yourself with

23:25.160 --> 23:28.160
paper, foam, or straw to preserve vinyl. Or salami.

23:28.160 --> 23:31.360
And beer bottles.

23:31.360 --> 23:35.600
6. Tap on the door every 15 minutes until help arrives. And actually in the little picture, it shows

23:35.600 --> 23:38.360
somebody sitting there with an open container of ice cream and a spoon.

23:38.360 --> 23:46.360
But my final piece of advice is, you know, just leave the door open.

23:46.360 --> 23:50.360
When you're cleaning out your freezer at the 7-11, just leave the door open.

23:50.360 --> 23:56.360
And if you're in the freezer at the 7-11, you could probably get out through where they have, like, the drinks or something.

23:56.360 --> 24:00.360
Do us one, dive through the eggs.

24:00.360 --> 24:05.360
Wow, okay. Moving on, we have a nice follow-up story.

24:05.360 --> 24:10.360
You remember a couple weeks ago on the show here, we had Matt from the Save Kings Quest 9 campaign

24:10.360 --> 24:16.360
was on the show to talk about, you know how Kings Quest 9 had a stop put to it by the man, basically, at Vivendi,

24:16.360 --> 24:19.360
and they were doing this huge letter-writing campaign to get it going again?

24:19.360 --> 24:23.360
Well, guess what? They kinda succeeded. It worked.

24:23.360 --> 24:24.360
Really?

24:24.360 --> 24:30.120
Vivendi has granted a license, it's what they're calling a fan license, to allow

24:30.120 --> 24:35.240
King's Quest IX, every cloak has a silver lining to come out. However, one small

24:35.240 --> 24:38.560
change, they will have to alter the title to take King's Quest out of the title,

24:38.560 --> 24:43.320
they will be releasing the game simply as a silver lining. However, all the

24:43.320 --> 24:46.600
King's Quest characters get to stay intact. Presumably the reason why Vivendi

24:46.600 --> 24:49.880
would be asking them to drop the name would be in case, you know, they see that

24:49.880 --> 24:52.960
this thing does really well, maybe they want to go, maybe we really should put

24:52.960 --> 24:59.600
out of King's Quest. Maybe we made a bad decision. Yeah, you did. But, kind of cool. I mean,

24:59.600 --> 25:03.620
you kind of have to applaud Vivendi here. They were, you know, looked at as the big

25:03.620 --> 25:08.460
evil man and here they are doing the right thing here in this case, I think. You know,

25:08.460 --> 25:12.620
why sit on this copyright if you're not going to do anything with it. Let some people who

25:12.620 --> 25:17.680
just want to have some fun and pay homage and keep your name out there do their thing.

25:17.680 --> 25:21.380
Think if they really wanted to do the big thing, then hire them to make it.

25:21.380 --> 25:24.500
think so I maybe it depends on how well this does because it's supposedly gonna

25:24.500 --> 25:27.900
be part of a trilogy the silver lining thing is all part of a trilogy they

25:27.900 --> 25:31.940
wanted to they're going all nine yards with this thing no pun intended we shall

25:31.940 --> 25:35.940
see be fun I'll download it I'll check it out I hope Rosella's in it instead of

25:35.940 --> 25:41.020
calling it King's Quest it could be like Kings look around well they're just

25:41.020 --> 25:43.500
dropping the Kings question it's gonna have the characters but it won't it

25:43.500 --> 25:47.420
won't reference that name I know I know well I thought was Queen's journey we

25:47.420 --> 25:53.520
decided on a previous... anyway forget it. Monarch Trek. Let's talk about video game

25:53.520 --> 25:58.400
movie news. Oh, we all love video game movie news, don't we? First off, Silent

25:58.400 --> 26:02.780
Hill. Website opened up. They're doing this poster competition, design a

26:02.780 --> 26:06.040
poster, win an advanced screening thing. Dark Soccer, you better be entering this

26:06.040 --> 26:11.440
thing, because I want to go. You know, I have finals. There's a little teaser trailer

26:11.440 --> 26:15.920
thing posted on the site. It's very sexy, I gotta say. It's just like trailers for

26:15.920 --> 26:20.120
the game. And Pyramid Head you can see for like.5 seconds. And nurse's feet. You can

26:20.120 --> 26:23.160
see the nurse's feet. So it's very cool because they're advertising the movie like it's a

26:23.160 --> 26:26.760
game. They said it's not, it's not, I gotta put this out there, it's not a real trailer.

26:26.760 --> 26:31.120
It's the flash animation from the site. Yeah. But presumably, you know, if the real trailer

26:31.120 --> 26:35.680
looks like that, it's gonna be sexy. We have high hopes for this game. Do not disappoint

26:35.680 --> 26:39.960
us. However, one minor disappointment this week, I think this is a disappointment, um,

26:39.960 --> 26:44.800
it was reported that Akira Yamauka will not actually be doing the music for the Silent

26:44.800 --> 26:48.800
He did the music for the games, he will not be doing the music for the movie.

26:48.800 --> 26:52.800
That honor will go to Jeff Danna, who did the music for Resident Evil Apocalypse.

26:52.800 --> 26:56.800
However, he has said, I know Jamie wants to get something in there because she's mad,

26:56.800 --> 27:01.800
but, however, I do want to say that he's, the executive producer Andrew Mason said

27:01.800 --> 27:06.800
that Jeff Danna will be incorporating elements from the original game's score

27:06.800 --> 27:08.800
into the movie's score, so at least you get that.

27:08.800 --> 27:09.800
That's what I was going to say.

27:09.800 --> 27:10.800
Oh, okay.

27:10.800 --> 27:14.940
I've been like every day looking at Silent Hill stuff

27:14.940 --> 27:19.620
I would still at least like to see Akira get to do like a vocal song or something, you know

27:19.620 --> 27:25.560
Cuz he did such great songs for the games that could have been I don't think they would have ever been a runaway MTV hit

27:25.560 --> 27:28.680
But I think they could have really appealed to the audience that would go see Silent Hill

27:28.680 --> 27:32.420
You know the songs like you're not here from three and you know

27:33.240 --> 27:38.600
Stuff from four like really in vain this breaks the pattern of movie game, you know

27:38.600 --> 27:45.600
I hope so, too. It looks pretty dead on so far. If that flash trailer is anything that was that was

27:46.640 --> 27:51.640
Exactly how it should be exactly. Well, apparently I'd play it for you guys, but we're a radio show

27:51.640 --> 27:55.140
Just just go to the site and check it out. Well, I didn't I

27:55.880 --> 27:58.520
Actually don't have the link on me because it's on my home computer

27:59.320 --> 28:04.120
But I had seen a site that had a bit more

28:04.120 --> 28:09.360
information they've as far as the characters and it there there is are at

28:09.360 --> 28:16.160
least mentions to characters that are in the other Silent Hill games and they are

28:16.160 --> 28:22.240
bringing in Dalia and Alessa from the first game mm-hmm and somebody else who

28:22.240 --> 28:25.960
I think was referred to in the third game and give me a second well that

28:25.960 --> 28:28.240
makes sense though because the third game was kind of a continuation of the

28:28.240 --> 28:33.200
first story so but it is actually from what I understand officially part of the

28:33.200 --> 28:38.280
whole Silent Hill story just because if this if this movie does well I want to

28:38.280 --> 28:41.800
see a sequel all right other movie news remember how we talked about last week

28:41.800 --> 28:45.160
that there's that guy who did hellboy who they're trying to get to do halo he

28:45.160 --> 28:48.480
may not really do halo because he really wants to do hellboy 2 they say he's torn

28:48.480 --> 28:52.640
so we'll see I can't even remember the guy's name del toro del toro I don't

28:52.640 --> 28:57.520
know there okay it's the director let's wait till we see some shots from the set

28:57.520 --> 29:03.760
and then we'll get excited. One other video game news thing though, even when

29:03.760 --> 29:08.400
you consider that Doom did not do too hot at the box office, it made 49 million

29:08.400 --> 29:14.560
worldwide on a 60 million budget, they are going to do a return to Castle

29:14.560 --> 29:19.920
Wolfenstein movie, at least that's what ID software wants to do, nobody is, I

29:19.920 --> 29:24.360
don't think bought this yet, but they want a movie for return to Castle

29:24.360 --> 29:29.320
Wolfenstein which you might know is you know in some ways the predecessor to Doom

29:29.320 --> 29:35.720
if you go as far back as Wolfenstein 3d so do the first-person crap they better

29:35.720 --> 29:43.680
not I actually did find that information by the way yes just actually I found it

29:43.680 --> 29:46.980
on a Wikipedia that's where I had seen it there's a character in the movie

29:46.980 --> 29:50.640
called Christabella who if I remember correctly was also a character in the

29:50.640 --> 29:57.480
comic series and several of the people the main character rose her last name is

29:57.480 --> 30:05.960
Mason which was Heather was Cheryl Mason and Harry Mason and there's also a

30:05.960 --> 30:12.640
Sharon Mason in this and also other I think another character in here relates

30:12.640 --> 30:15.920
to another character that had been in Silent Hill 3 it sounds like they're

30:15.920 --> 30:19.960
staying pretty faithful don't let me down yeah all right moving on now let's

30:19.960 --> 30:24.480
Let's talk about, let's see, well here's a game we were talking about a heck of a lot

30:24.480 --> 30:27.460
earlier in the show, Animal Crossing DS.

30:27.460 --> 30:31.100
And this was a story I ended up finding on dig.com, which I thought was interesting because

30:31.100 --> 30:36.760
they labeled this, the headline, Animal Crossing Speaks Out Against the RIAA, and I was kinda

30:36.760 --> 30:37.760
like, WTF?

30:37.760 --> 30:40.800
Yeah, I saw that last night.

30:40.800 --> 30:45.440
I went to the, I did not do the KK Slider thing, because I, he comes to your town, what,

30:45.440 --> 30:46.440
Saturday night?

30:46.440 --> 30:50.840
I was seven seven thirty to eight is his warm-up eight to midnight is the show. I I

30:51.480 --> 30:53.320
Usually go out clubbing

30:53.320 --> 30:55.220
Saturday nights, but not last I was coughing

30:55.220 --> 30:59.320
But anyway, no, this is interesting and part of what KK slider says is a little introduction

30:59.760 --> 31:04.180
Those industry fat cats try to put a price on my music, but it wants to be free

31:05.400 --> 31:08.360
I think somebody might be taking that a little too far

31:08.360 --> 31:12.640
I don't know if I'd see that as a slam against the RIAA, but that was the first impression

31:12.640 --> 31:15.540
I got he said a little bit more than that. I I don't know

31:15.540 --> 31:20.940
I just kind of got the sense it fits into his character cuz you know, he's he's supposed to be this wandering nomad guy

31:20.940 --> 31:22.940
Well, he gives you like copies of his

31:24.020 --> 31:27.360
I don't know. I think people might be taking that a little far

31:27.360 --> 31:32.300
I don't know if I think it would not be in Nintendo's best interest to speak out against the RIAA, but

31:33.020 --> 31:39.160
The bit of Nintendo was actually really worried about putting that impression. They would have phrased that line a little differently

31:39.160 --> 31:41.160
I guess you got a point true

31:41.160 --> 31:46.320
Now, I've got to ask about this because we've been talking about a lot of new consoles here

31:46.320 --> 31:49.960
tonight, but I want to hear about an old console, and Loki, you have some pretty exciting news

31:49.960 --> 31:51.200
regarding an old console.

31:51.200 --> 31:58.880
Yeah, Sega is apparently, well, it's a rumor of course, but some German gaming site, Gamefront.de,

31:58.880 --> 32:03.520
is claiming that they're going to be re-releasing the Dreamcast, basically.

32:03.520 --> 32:10.560
It's bundled with some limited edition phone card or something, but it's supposed to probably

32:10.560 --> 32:17.000
only be released in Japan and distributed through Sega Direct for about $83 US or 10,000

32:17.000 --> 32:18.000
yen.

32:18.000 --> 32:23.320
Or you could just go to GameStop and get a used one for like 30 bucks, however much they're

32:23.320 --> 32:24.320
running.

32:24.320 --> 32:26.240
I know, it's still a neat idea.

32:26.240 --> 32:28.040
I still play my Dreamcast.

32:28.040 --> 32:30.360
I would be doing homebrew on that Dreamcast.

32:30.360 --> 32:35.720
I watched a show that just happened to be on TV when we were done watching whatever

32:35.720 --> 32:37.500
it was we were watching.

32:37.500 --> 32:43.860
It had one of the Wayne brothers in it, but the little kid in that was playing a Dreamcast.

32:43.860 --> 32:44.860
I thought it was funny.

32:44.860 --> 32:45.860
That's cool.

32:45.860 --> 32:50.460
All right, speaking about releases, let's talk about upcoming release dates for different

32:50.460 --> 32:51.460
games.

32:51.460 --> 32:54.260
Loki, any word on what's going on in the US?

32:54.260 --> 32:59.660
Dead or Alive 4 slowly creeping its way to 2006.

32:59.660 --> 33:02.660
It's right now actually lingering on December 27th.

33:02.660 --> 33:04.780
Why don't they just say, we'll put it out when it's done?

33:04.780 --> 33:07.460
Why don't they just say that, we'll put it out when it's done?

33:07.460 --> 33:12.180
27th. Yeah, two days after Christmas is a great day to put out a video game.

33:12.180 --> 33:16.940
That's what I say. I don't know. I guess people could use gift cards and stuff, but still.

33:16.940 --> 33:20.460
I'll pick it up. I mean, it looks cool. So, I don't play fighting games, but...

33:20.460 --> 33:23.580
It was one of the games that made me want to get a 360. It looks cool. Back when I thought

33:23.580 --> 33:25.220
I'd be able to walk in a store and get one.

33:25.220 --> 33:28.420
Alright. So. What's going on? Oh, anything else?

33:28.420 --> 33:32.460
Um, as far as big releases coming up, um, beyond that,

33:32.460 --> 33:37.120
not too much in 360s stuff. Um, you've got College Hoops 2K6 coming out

33:37.120 --> 33:42.800
in January, as well as Top Spin 2, which we actually got to play at E3 a little bit.

33:42.800 --> 33:48.720
And other than that, the normal consoles, we have 25 The Life, which is coming out,

33:48.720 --> 33:56.720
Ape Escape 3, and then Final Fantasy IV Advance on the 13th, I found that one out, the hard

33:56.720 --> 33:57.720
way.

33:57.720 --> 33:59.640
Final Fantasy IV on the 13th of January?

33:59.640 --> 34:01.440
No, of December, this week.

34:01.440 --> 34:04.380
Yes, yes, that's this week.

34:04.380 --> 34:11.060
And then, of course, Trueswink Golf, you're a golf fan for the DS, that's pretty good.

34:11.060 --> 34:14.820
It's basically a pretty weak month, February it's going to start picking up again though.

34:14.820 --> 34:15.820
Sounds good.

34:15.820 --> 34:18.180
And what's going on with our friends over at The Big Pond?

34:18.180 --> 34:21.900
I've only got like three real dates, and the others are like fourth quarter.

34:21.900 --> 34:22.900
That's alright.

34:22.900 --> 34:32.580
16th Sims 2, 17th King Kong for the GBA, 23rd Madden NFL 2006 for the PSP, and some of

34:32.580 --> 34:38.900
The others mentioned without Daze, SoCom 3, Shaman King, Snowboard Kids DS, America's

34:38.900 --> 34:45.960
Army, Bioshock, Call of Cthulhu, Dead to Rights, a few titles along those lines.

34:45.960 --> 34:50.880
Now, just out of this morbid curiosity, do they have to alter Madden NFL when they release

34:50.880 --> 34:55.320
it in Britain because football is not football there?

34:55.320 --> 34:56.320
It's different.

34:56.320 --> 34:57.640
As far as I was aware, it's just called American football.

34:57.640 --> 35:01.600
Oh, well, I don't know if that means they gotta recode stuff in the game or whatever.

35:01.600 --> 35:05.100
No, it's just called NFL, so I'll be in the National Football League.

35:05.100 --> 35:07.100
Just curious, just want my curiosity thing.

35:07.100 --> 35:09.100
I was going to mention one thing since we're talking about the UK.

35:09.100 --> 35:20.100
The official Xbox 360 magazine is going to be, the January issue is going to have a disc to be able to play the Final Fantasy XI beta on the 360.

35:20.100 --> 35:21.100
Here, or in the UK?

35:21.100 --> 35:25.100
I think in the UK I'm not sure about here, but maybe.

35:25.100 --> 35:27.100
So check that out.

35:27.100 --> 35:30.100
Well lucky you guys, if you guys get that in America doesn't.

35:30.100 --> 35:35.320
Another interesting game one here is Shin Megami Tensei, which we actually got over

35:35.320 --> 35:36.320
here.

35:36.320 --> 35:38.320
Yeah, a digital double saga.

35:38.320 --> 35:42.720
Alright, well, speaking of UK, I understand that in our mailbag this week we heard from

35:42.720 --> 35:47.000
quite a few people over in the UK, so of course we encourage you guys to email us whenever

35:47.000 --> 35:51.040
you have something to say, togo at orangelaungeradio.com, that's the place to be, and of course you

35:51.040 --> 35:57.880
can always visit our website too at www.orangelaungeradio.com and post in the forums and what have you.

35:57.880 --> 36:00.200
Let's go over and open up the old mailbag, Dark Sakura.

36:00.200 --> 36:08.080
Oh, actually, we, uh, didn't get a number of, uh, emails, um, and most everybody, there

36:08.080 --> 36:13.360
was a pretty big consensus on how it is the job of the parent, you know, to...

36:13.360 --> 36:15.800
Oh, last week's follow-up, and we had the, you know...

36:15.800 --> 36:21.280
That's what a lot, that's what a lot of it was, um, there was one in particular, though.

36:21.280 --> 36:26.040
Um, okay, here we go, it's one from, uh, one of our listeners from outside London.

36:26.040 --> 36:29.760
Is this the one you read me before the show?

36:29.760 --> 36:30.760
Listen up.

36:30.760 --> 36:31.760
This is great.

36:31.760 --> 36:32.760
Listen to this.

36:32.760 --> 36:33.760
By Gareth.

36:33.760 --> 36:38.080
Hey guys, was listening to your show on the way to work today.

36:38.080 --> 36:40.000
I live just outside London, UK by the way.

36:40.000 --> 36:46.240
I have a 2.75 year old daughter which piqued my interest in your chat about parents' responsibility

36:46.240 --> 36:47.240
with their kids.

36:47.240 --> 36:51.540
So my daughter and I play games together, mostly things like Trackmania Sunrise, she

36:51.540 --> 36:56.340
likes painting the cars, to Incredibles to Super Mario Sunshine.

36:56.340 --> 37:00.380
She also has some kids games like Dora the Explorer along with some web games on the

37:00.380 --> 37:01.380
BBC.

37:01.380 --> 37:03.940
So my point, I was surprised at two things.

37:03.940 --> 37:07.260
One, it is hard to get games that don't feature some sort of violence.

37:07.260 --> 37:11.420
We are by nature a society that violence has a part of it.

37:11.420 --> 37:16.000
Two, she was very quick to pick up on the violent parts of games and knows when she

37:16.000 --> 37:18.140
is hitting someone or something.

37:18.140 --> 37:21.980
She even vocalizes it by saying hit or shoot when she does this.

37:21.980 --> 37:24.980
After being a bit worried about this, I thought this is not a problem.

37:24.980 --> 37:28.420
She has parents who monitor and guide her behavior and we have not seen her try to replicate

37:28.420 --> 37:30.620
the violence she has seen on the game so far.

37:30.620 --> 37:36.620
I know from my experience as a long time gamer and now a parent, that is my parent's guidance

37:36.620 --> 37:40.420
and active parenting that made the biggest difference to me being well adjusted while

37:40.420 --> 37:42.180
some think so.

37:42.180 --> 37:45.940
You won't be able to change your kids' environments and their exposure to violence that easily,

37:45.940 --> 37:49.500
But you definitely can be a big influence and how they react and live with it

37:49.500 --> 37:56.040
And I thought that last year if we put there was the best way anyone could ever say it you have major kudos from me

37:56.660 --> 37:58.340
beautifully put

37:58.340 --> 38:02.660
That's right. Can you get it through one more email? I can get through a couple. All right, cool. Um

38:04.420 --> 38:06.420
Also, um got an email from

38:07.140 --> 38:10.420
Deep in one of our Australian list. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I'm

38:11.380 --> 38:12.900
talking about the

38:12.900 --> 38:18.500
50 cent game 50 cent. Oh god. Oh my god. I watched like five minutes of the

38:19.420 --> 38:26.220
This bike TV video game awards and I saw like a little bit of that 50 cent game and I was just like this is

38:26.940 --> 38:31.000
Well, I don't this is so not the type of game that appeals to me in any way shape or form

38:31.260 --> 38:38.900
Well, you said the the 50 cent game been banned in Australia for drug use and excessive violence and for sucking really bad

38:38.900 --> 38:43.900
I don't think you can ban a game for sucking, if that were the case, there would be a lot of games that wouldn't be on the market now.

38:43.900 --> 38:55.900
Actually, there's something worse, and unfortunately Konami's, um, stent into the beat-em-up game genre, uh, crime life gang wars. Horrible reviews. Horrible reviews.

38:55.900 --> 38:58.900
Really? That's too bad.

38:58.900 --> 39:06.780
As I was reading sorry to quote down here if a game gets an R rating it literally can't be sold in stores other titles

39:06.780 --> 39:10.640
Include the original GTA 3 game where you could pick up hookers and screw them to get back life

39:10.940 --> 39:14.980
Which was edited out and re-released and manhunt in cases like this

39:14.980 --> 39:19.920
You guys are lucky that your stuff only get censored as much as they do and not completely banned from stores like our stuff. Oh

39:20.660 --> 39:25.920
And he also mentioned that a claim is bankrupt and now selling off rights to game so we could get the rights to bust

39:25.920 --> 39:30.320
to move if we wanted it oh yeah that's right I did a story on my my live show

39:30.320 --> 39:33.200
on the station this week about that that's kind of interesting and and I

39:33.200 --> 39:36.280
thought it was interesting because only one of the Mary Kate Ashley Wilson games

39:36.280 --> 39:42.880
sought after out of the like we're global there was another another point

39:42.880 --> 39:47.000
made by one of our listeners in Scotland I've been getting a lot of overseas

39:47.000 --> 39:53.760
writing these days I think it's pretty cool yeah it's neat um from Sloane said

39:53.760 --> 40:04.840
who's got three kids, 33, and um, I just completely lost where I was reading, said, um, part of

40:04.840 --> 40:08.560
the course is to discover your market when designing a game. You come up with an overall

40:08.560 --> 40:12.880
concept and test the market to see who your primary persona is. They mentioned a site

40:12.880 --> 40:18.460
that's uh, d-e-s-a dot com, Entertainment Software Association, that has a report called

40:18.460 --> 40:23.940
essential facts about the computer and video game industry, um, so that has, um, some interesting

40:23.940 --> 40:30.940
statistics. For example, the average age of a game buyer is 37, so it's really the parents

40:34.620 --> 40:39.420
that are buying the games, the older sibling buying the games. And most of the time, it's

40:39.420 --> 40:43.580
the kid saying, hey, I want this game, or their parents saying, hey kid, do you want

40:43.580 --> 40:50.180
this game and the kid going sure I'd like the suffering and yes I've actually

40:50.180 --> 40:55.500
seen this happen just recently at one of our local video game stores so I know

40:55.500 --> 41:00.100
very well but to quote I'm gonna read this one's paragraph here I think is

41:00.100 --> 41:05.420
very important parents need to be educated you wouldn't take your kid to

41:05.420 --> 41:10.340
an 18 certificate movie or would you my son the 11 year old has a friend whose

41:10.340 --> 41:13.720
parents regularly let him watch horror movies and play video games such as GTA

41:13.720 --> 41:20.200
and Doom 3. There's a lack of parental instruction here. I bet what my children

41:20.200 --> 41:22.520
see when they are in my sight but what are the parents

41:22.520 --> 41:26.640
I'm sorry but what are the other parents exposing my child to when they visit

41:26.640 --> 41:31.280
their friends friends and he also goes on for this says by age means this kid

41:31.280 --> 41:33.960
is mature enough when you're 11 you laugh at dick and fart jokes and naked

41:33.960 --> 41:38.440
women but that's not particularly mature. I'm still doing that at 27. We still tell

41:38.440 --> 41:46.280
them but you know I thought this was pretty pretty smart make the law similar

41:46.280 --> 41:50.880
to DVD video and liquor sales if you supply to underage person you can be

41:50.880 --> 41:55.080
prosecuted parents know your ratings they are not difficult and I agree with

41:55.080 --> 42:02.360
Rob that ratings should be the same as movies GTA series are rated by the by

42:02.360 --> 42:07.440
the BBFC as an 18 same as violent movie I hear over here in the UK he also

42:07.440 --> 42:10.560
mentions to Matt you two are quite correct parents should do their own

42:10.560 --> 42:13.720
homework who's responsible for a kid when they're out in the street playing

42:13.720 --> 42:16.700
it's no longer acceptable to say it's okay he's upstairs playing on his

42:16.700 --> 42:24.760
computer look what happened to Matthew Broderick that's a good reference I'm

42:24.760 --> 42:27.960
just playing a game I'm thrilled that someone agrees with me that makes 50

42:27.960 --> 42:31.960
episodes of doing this crap so worth it that somebody agrees with me my last

42:31.960 --> 42:35.400
thing on this my last thing yes it said I leave you with the quote from a

42:35.400 --> 42:39.400
congressional hearing chaired by Joe Lieberman. This was a few years ago.

42:39.400 --> 42:44.220
This was nice to see he still hates video games. This quote is from Marilyn

42:44.220 --> 42:47.700
Dross, the VP of National Coalition of Television Violence. This is what she had

42:47.700 --> 42:51.600
to say. If the Pentagon was to ever have suggested years ago that we put video

42:51.600 --> 42:56.000
games that teach children how to aim guns and train them at the age of eight

42:56.000 --> 43:00.000
to be soldiers and ever invented a game to put in the homes of young boys to

43:00.000 --> 43:03.880
train them to be in the military, I can't begin to tell you...you know

43:03.880 --> 43:08.000
What kind of upward there would be in this country if our government was to start training early killers?

43:09.520 --> 43:17.480
Is it mentioned on there Americans are America's are mostly in that what America's Army does she was talking about the Nintendo Super Scope I

43:20.680 --> 43:25.680
Thought that was such a wonderful point and this whole the Nintendo Super Scope was nothing

43:25.680 --> 43:32.860
I know I was playing blastress. I don't blot in the mole game. Come on. This bowl game was stupid, but hey

43:33.240 --> 43:37.320
But I would honestly I would really for those last two letters

43:37.320 --> 43:41.680
I would really love to have our writers a permission to post those on our site

43:41.680 --> 43:47.000
Really because those are the most well thought-out things I have read in the past couple weeks

43:47.860 --> 43:53.960
Awesome. Well if you guys want to send us an email to go to go at orange launch radio.com any last little bits

43:53.960 --> 43:59.900
you want to read anything um it's really I've gotten several emails along the

43:59.900 --> 44:07.140
same lines uh one of our friends uh our listeners John wrote in you know

44:07.140 --> 44:12.680
basically saying more of the same you know I especially like the point the

44:12.680 --> 44:18.420
point saying is that you know no matter if you're into the violent games listen

44:18.420 --> 44:25.140
you know emo music or or you know like horror movies you know you can still be

44:25.140 --> 44:31.160
a peaceful person you know I really liked that one point you're saying emo

44:31.160 --> 44:34.760
reminds me of this simple fact do you know what is ten times worse than video

44:34.760 --> 44:40.680
games emo no myspace I swear to God myspace is worse than any video game I've

44:40.680 --> 44:47.100
ever seen I mean really and every kid has a profile on myspace it's sad well I

44:47.100 --> 44:52.100
I thought it was funny that he did actually mirror something that you said, um, I'll just quote this last and that's then to the mailbox.

44:52.100 --> 44:52.600
Alrighty.

44:52.600 --> 44:53.600
Cause we got a lot of mail this time around.

44:53.600 --> 44:54.100
I know.

44:54.100 --> 44:59.100
This law is not a ban, it's simply a way to prevent kids from buying games that their parents might not approve of.

44:59.100 --> 45:03.100
Honest, caring, and hardworking parents work until 5 or 6 p.m.

45:03.100 --> 45:07.100
With their child at home, they can't prevent them from going to the store and buying a GTA-type game.

45:07.100 --> 45:09.100
True. True.

45:09.100 --> 45:14.100
And in that respect, I do support that aspect of it, and I think I said as much last week.

45:14.100 --> 45:21.360
it's just that I still think that it is really difficult I think on parents to

45:21.360 --> 45:26.040
have that kind of active stance in their children's lives but I still think that

45:26.040 --> 45:29.080
you know if they weren't ready for the responsibility they shouldn't have had

45:29.080 --> 45:32.680
the children to begin with all right well we look forward to getting your

45:32.680 --> 45:36.280
more emails to go and orange not sure that I'll come let's get back into some

45:36.280 --> 45:41.040
news now Loki I brought up the video game awards on Spike TV there a little

45:41.040 --> 45:43.840
bit I know you you caught a little glimpse of it or did you watch a whole

45:43.840 --> 45:49.080
damn thing or what happened? I watched the after show, and the first part

45:49.080 --> 45:51.440
of the show, and that's when Nellie started waking up and she's like, what the hell's

45:51.440 --> 45:56.760
on TV? And I was like, uhhh, video game show. Anyways,

45:56.760 --> 45:59.920
so at the after show they were showing a bunch of trailers for games that were coming out

45:59.920 --> 46:06.560
including Splinter Cell 4, which I'm now calling 24 the Game 2, because it looks very similar

46:06.560 --> 46:10.640
to it. Anyways, but lots of cool games coming out,

46:10.640 --> 46:15.440
excited about that stuff, but the best part though, is I think this is the way video game

46:15.440 --> 46:20.680
war shows should be. I mean, this is really good actually. It was a very good show, definitely

46:20.680 --> 46:26.400
a whole lot better than G4ia. What they started off with is Samuel L. Jackson because he was

46:26.400 --> 46:30.240
hosting the whole thing, I mean that's good just from the start. He was playing the part

46:30.240 --> 46:35.040
of, and I haven't played this far into the Warriors or I haven't seen the movie yet,

46:35.040 --> 46:38.320
the main character in the Warriors, you know the guy in the beginning, the CAN YOU DIG

46:38.320 --> 46:45.320
But they had all the video game characters in the audience and the crowd, and the best part about the whole thing is you see Katamari rolling around.

46:45.320 --> 46:49.320
It's picking up people as it's going along and stuff, and that was the greatest thing ever.

46:49.320 --> 46:54.320
And then Tack from Tack 3 or whatever, he's all,

46:54.320 --> 46:55.320
He's all,

46:55.320 --> 46:58.320
Why yes! Come out and play!

46:58.320 --> 47:04.320
And he shoots Samuel L. Jackson, and I thought that was great, it was really funny.

47:04.320 --> 47:10.200
And they put a whole MTV Music Awards spin on it, and I really liked the way they did

47:10.200 --> 47:11.200
that.

47:11.200 --> 47:13.160
I watched about five minutes, I thought it was stupid.

47:13.160 --> 47:14.160
Sorry.

47:14.160 --> 47:17.240
The music part was stupid, but I did like the fact that they were doing this kind of

47:17.240 --> 47:20.520
fun little twist on it and stuff.

47:20.520 --> 47:26.160
However though, there's only really two awards shows out there, they are still highly superior

47:26.160 --> 47:27.160
to G4U.

47:27.160 --> 47:28.160
We'll see.

47:28.160 --> 47:31.560
Jamie, I'm curious if you've heard about this, because I'm sure you've got to have an opinion

47:31.560 --> 47:32.560
on this.

47:32.560 --> 47:36.280
the wrong way to hold a protest did you hear about this kid I was like some 16

47:36.280 --> 47:42.160
year old kid got basically arrested or charged anyway by threatening the one

47:42.160 --> 47:48.480
and only Jack Thompson with torture and death he basically I don't know sent this

47:48.480 --> 47:51.400
thing to say all these nasty things he was going to do to Jack Thompson it's

47:51.400 --> 47:55.000
kind of one of those like yeah you remember on the old Animaniacs good idea

47:55.000 --> 48:01.040
bad idea this would be bad idea how old was he 16 I think so about he's gonna be

48:01.040 --> 48:08.880
out soon but I'm kind of paraphrasing from what I read earlier this week yeah

48:08.880 --> 48:14.560
stupid stupid stupid thing to do very stupid you know what I think is

48:14.560 --> 48:21.720
interesting though is who put out the press release on this Jack Thompson do

48:21.720 --> 48:27.480
anything yeah I know and I feel bad because now I'm contributing to this but

48:27.480 --> 48:30.140
I'm only reporting what's out there on the internet because half the gaming

48:30.140 --> 48:34.820
sites out there also reported this it's kind of like I thought I thought we were

48:34.820 --> 48:41.600
bad attention whores he needs to get death threats just realize that nobody

48:41.600 --> 48:48.020
cares and I'm tired of talking about him well no now to say that I think this kid

48:48.020 --> 48:53.060
went a little far but I you know what he was fight amongst yourselves fight

48:53.060 --> 48:56.840
amongst yourselves that's all I wanted to say on that I don't want to go I say

48:56.840 --> 49:02.860
for the rest of the month unless he gets cancer of the liver.

49:02.860 --> 49:03.860
No more jack talk.

49:03.860 --> 49:05.480
You're going to get sued for that.

49:05.480 --> 49:11.000
I am not saying that I am going to inject him with cancerous cells so that he dies of

49:11.000 --> 49:17.520
liver cancer, but if he does, I'd like to report it.

49:17.520 --> 49:22.600
Swiftly changing the subject over to Castlevania, let's talk about Castlevania.

49:22.600 --> 49:25.320
I think this is kind of interesting.

49:25.320 --> 49:29.160
for no real reason is going to be packaging Aria of Sorrow and Harmony of

49:29.160 --> 49:33.200
Dissonance together into one game and that will be coming out the first quarter

49:33.200 --> 49:37.280
of 2006 and there's no real reason why they're doing it they're not really

49:37.280 --> 49:41.880
adding anything to these games I think they're doing this because cap DS is

49:41.880 --> 49:45.080
selling so freaking huge and so they want to kind of capitalize on a little

49:45.080 --> 49:51.120
step all the time those two would still sell separately on their own except I

49:51.120 --> 49:54.560
don't think they make either one anymore I didn't already have them I know it's

49:54.560 --> 49:55.560
That's kinda how I feel.

49:55.560 --> 49:56.560
Alright.

49:56.560 --> 49:57.560
Um.

49:57.560 --> 50:02.080
Jamie, you have a story about another racing game, we've been talking about Project Gotham

50:02.080 --> 50:04.800
and all this other stuff, but you have a racing game that sounds pretty hot.

50:04.800 --> 50:05.800
No, no, no.

50:05.800 --> 50:07.680
Best racing game series ever.

50:07.680 --> 50:08.680
Outrun.

50:08.680 --> 50:09.680
Woohoo.

50:09.680 --> 50:16.160
Cause, you know, at my house, and you've seen at my house, classic Sega horror house.

50:16.160 --> 50:18.160
That didn't sound too right.

50:18.160 --> 50:19.160
Anyway.

50:19.160 --> 50:20.440
I digress.

50:20.440 --> 50:25.440
Sega has announced Outrun 2006, and we all cheer, yay!

50:25.440 --> 50:26.440
Um, Outrun...

50:26.440 --> 50:27.440
Yay!

50:27.440 --> 50:34.040
Um, basically, um, Sega's confirmed Outrun 2006 Coast to Coast will be released March

50:34.040 --> 50:39.440
2006 on the PS2, PSP, and PC, but guess what, not on...

50:39.440 --> 50:40.440
Arcade!

50:40.440 --> 50:41.440
Xbox!

50:41.440 --> 50:42.440
Hm.

50:42.440 --> 50:43.440
And no arcade.

50:43.440 --> 50:44.440
I didn't see...

50:44.440 --> 50:51.800
It's going to be 30 stages, the best of both Outrun 2 and Outrun 2 SP, mission structure,

50:51.800 --> 50:58.720
license mode, 6 player online, total of 12 licensed Ferraris, including the F430 and

50:58.720 --> 50:59.720
Super America.

50:59.720 --> 51:02.660
Well, you said something about Outrun 2 and previous Outruns, they're not just repackaging

51:02.660 --> 51:03.660
the same crap, right?

51:03.660 --> 51:07.400
They're going to give it a facelift and everything, bring it to the next gen, right?

51:07.400 --> 51:08.400
That's what it sounds like.

51:08.400 --> 51:10.400
They have to think better.

51:10.400 --> 51:22.400
Also, it says PSP owners who also have the PS2 version will be able to access exclusive content by hooking them up with a USB cable. Finally a use!

51:22.400 --> 51:25.400
They actually do that with a lot of games.

51:25.400 --> 51:26.400
Really?

51:26.400 --> 51:33.400
Well, at any rate, it's being put out in development by Sumo Digital. They actually were the ones who ported Outrun 2 to Xbox.

51:33.400 --> 51:44.400
Like WWE, Smackdown vs. Raw 6, SoCalm, Fireteam Bravo, and SoCalm 3, uh, Madden.

51:44.400 --> 51:49.400
Alright, Loki I'm about out of stuff, what else you got for us tonight?

51:49.400 --> 51:52.400
I know you had something on like Metal Gear or something in a pretty cool hack.

51:52.400 --> 51:54.400
Metal Gear?

51:54.400 --> 51:57.400
Didn't you say you had something about Metal Gear Acid 2 or something?

51:57.400 --> 51:59.400
Oh no, yeah Metal Gear Acid 2.

51:59.400 --> 52:08.400
It's actually quite funny, is they found out one of the things that's actually featured in the game, because someone of course dumped the ROM for it, and they discovered videos of...

52:08.400 --> 52:09.400
Wait, is the game out?

52:09.400 --> 52:10.400
Yeah, in Japan.

52:10.400 --> 52:11.400
Oh, okay.

52:11.400 --> 52:18.400
Of scantily clad women for use with that special viewing device that they have, the solid eye.

52:18.400 --> 52:27.400
So you get 3D video of scantily clad women, as well as a trailer for Rebel Roses X-X, which is kinda cool.

52:27.400 --> 52:28.400
Hot.

52:28.400 --> 52:38.120
In other news, this is called, it's bound to happen sooner or later, the first 360 game

52:38.120 --> 52:45.480
has been dumped to a hard drive, a group going by the name of Pi has released a 360 dump

52:45.480 --> 52:50.400
extract tool, they were able to rip apart the games to extract them to their PC's hard

52:50.400 --> 52:51.400
drive.

52:51.400 --> 52:54.000
Gideon the Royal on the other hand, that's another story, but still

52:55.160 --> 52:58.000
One small step for hackers. Yeah

52:58.960 --> 53:01.680
One giant forget it. I don't know anyways

53:02.840 --> 53:07.480
So that was interesting speaking more hacking stuff this guy actually

53:08.480 --> 53:10.480
going by the name of

53:11.480 --> 53:13.120
Parasite has

53:13.120 --> 53:17.640
Shown that you can hack levels into your online Wi-Fi

53:17.640 --> 53:24.640
for Mario Kart DS, and he's been able to play such levels as the TikTok Clock and other stuff.

53:24.640 --> 53:31.640
I don't think they've released how they've done this yet, but it has been shown that people have been doing it online.

53:31.640 --> 53:38.640
Kind of interesting, some of the levels kind of glitch out a little bit, but, you know, interesting.

53:38.640 --> 53:41.640
Interesting. Now, Jamie, what were you talking about a little bit before the show?

53:41.640 --> 53:44.640
Somebody had sent us an email about another Mario hack that was done.

53:44.640 --> 53:46.640
Yeah this was actually the other email I meant to read.

53:46.640 --> 53:47.640
Oh that's alright.

53:47.640 --> 53:49.640
Before I get to that there's actually a question for Logie.

53:49.640 --> 53:50.640
Oh sure.

53:50.640 --> 53:51.640
Okay.

53:51.640 --> 54:07.640
One of our writers, Sisbon, I say writers, our listeners, he said he's finished a bunch of missions in GTA, LCS for PSP and the only one left available is the booby prize bike race. Any tips for winning?

54:07.640 --> 54:15.640
I don't know. I didn't actually finish the game or play many of the missions. I just put a 100% code in to get all the characters for-

54:15.640 --> 54:16.640
Cheater!

54:16.640 --> 54:23.640
Well, here's what. I only play it for multiplayer. That's all I play the game for now, so I don't actually play three of the missions and stuff.

54:23.640 --> 54:26.640
So I just wanted to have all the characters unlocked and everything.

54:26.640 --> 54:28.640
I can't point fingers because I'm cheating at Silent Hill 3.

54:28.640 --> 54:31.640
You're going to have to go to game FAQs, my friend. Sorry.

54:31.640 --> 54:34.640
Yeah, Game Facts would be a good place to check.

54:34.640 --> 54:38.640
But I did send a very interesting link at themushroomkingdom.net

54:38.640 --> 54:42.640
It's the Super Mario Bros. 3 their lost levels

54:42.640 --> 54:46.640
I'll just read the first paragraph from that page

54:46.640 --> 54:50.640
Deep within Super Mario Bros. 3 lie hidden unused levels. Some of them seem polished

54:50.640 --> 54:54.640
with working goals and plenty of enemies, while others are devoid of enemies, lacking exits

54:54.640 --> 54:58.640
or too short to be full levels. There's actually a couple of pictures

54:58.640 --> 55:02.640
of them. One of them uses the boot. I love the boot.

55:02.640 --> 55:07.200
level in the actual game used the boot and it was so short and the boot was cool but

55:07.200 --> 55:11.520
it's pretty cool because the level maps are up on the page I'd say people should

55:11.520 --> 55:15.120
check it out if you're an old-school Super Mario Brothers player but you know

55:15.120 --> 55:18.880
that actually goes back into what we were saying there's always unused code

55:18.880 --> 55:24.480
in games yeah I mean this could have easily been Mario hot coffee where Mario

55:24.480 --> 55:33.000
the princess get it on another castle another castle another castle like some

55:33.000 --> 55:40.440
of these just a little short nothing special little blips of it but you just

55:40.440 --> 55:44.120
need to unlock something like that of a game that's been out right like God how

55:44.120 --> 55:50.680
long is a game now like 15 years or so it's not more 17 oh my god anyone think

55:50.680 --> 56:01.680
about it. That dates me. Anyway, um, anything else DarkSakura? No, I'm not. No. Loki, anything

56:01.680 --> 56:08.860
else? I just have one more, and that's, uh, this product has been released, uh, basically

56:08.860 --> 56:15.920
it's on this website, gameback-web.com, it's in their web store, it's called the PSP Bank,

56:15.920 --> 56:19.760
It's basically a 40GB hard drive for the PSP.

56:19.760 --> 56:26.080
What it looks actually to be is a hard drive that has a USB on the go, so you can actually

56:26.080 --> 56:28.520
transfer stuff between the hard drive and the PSP.

56:28.520 --> 56:33.760
However, you can't actually just access the entire hard drive using the PSP.

56:33.760 --> 56:37.760
So not quite cool, but a step in the right direction I guess.

56:37.760 --> 56:44.000
And also, there was another development here which is quite interesting.

56:44.000 --> 56:51.580
The guy that's basically behind, whoa what was it here, who's behind the cheat device

56:51.580 --> 56:58.340
for Grand Theft Auto, or they think it's actually done the same way, basically working on running

56:58.340 --> 57:07.060
firmware on 2.01 and 2.5 firmwares, maybe 2.6, running the homebrew stuff.

57:07.060 --> 57:12.860
So it's being worked on and probably be cracked soon, no surprise.

57:12.860 --> 57:16.720
One more story I got for you guys and that has to do, I knew Jamie would get a kick out

57:16.720 --> 57:17.720
of this one.

57:17.720 --> 57:23.100
I went to Slashdot earlier this week and I saw this and I totally thought of you, Jamie.

57:23.100 --> 57:26.460
The headline is, Gamers Better at Driving with Cell Phones?

57:26.460 --> 57:28.900
Okay, you know what?

57:28.900 --> 57:31.860
Hold on, I haven't read it yet.

57:31.860 --> 57:37.060
Let's see, the psychologists who are studying multitasking have argued for years about these

57:37.060 --> 57:39.660
information bottlenecks and they want to know why this occurs.

57:39.660 --> 57:43.260
Is it because people are lazy, because they have an inability to switch from one task

57:43.260 --> 57:44.260
to another?

57:44.260 --> 57:45.260
Who knows?

57:45.260 --> 57:50.220
But this Mei-Cheng Lin, who is an assistant professor of psychology at Oregon State University

57:50.220 --> 57:57.460
said, even with a seemingly simple task, structural cognitive limitations can prevent you from

57:57.460 --> 57:59.420
efficiently switching to a new task.

57:59.420 --> 58:03.900
I have to say that the best ones are those who play a lot of video games, she pointed

58:03.900 --> 58:04.980
out.

58:04.980 --> 58:08.700
Those are lab studies, however, not driving tests.

58:08.700 --> 58:12.480
So because you play video games, you're good at multitasking, so therefore gamers, get

58:12.480 --> 58:16.080
out on the road and start throwing those headsets away because you can multitask.

58:16.080 --> 58:21.560
I've said it once, I've said it a bajillion times, and somebody in this room is included

58:21.560 --> 58:27.120
in that, if you drive and talk on your cell phone, you are being a big dumb butt!

58:27.120 --> 58:30.000
You're endangering your life and those of other people.

58:30.000 --> 58:31.960
I'm multitasking, what can I say?

58:31.960 --> 58:34.520
Actually it's impossible to multitask.

58:34.520 --> 58:38.280
I can multitask, I'm a good driver.

58:38.280 --> 58:44.340
thoughts low key your final thought I want to get better my final thought is

58:44.340 --> 58:50.700
I hate being sick dark soccer um I'm tired of having the plague I've been sick

58:50.700 --> 58:56.200
since November 4th I don't think I'm ever gonna get better well that's a

58:56.200 --> 59:00.740
