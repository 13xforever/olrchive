445867	446368	It may happen.
446968	450730	Lio365 might finally pull the plug on us mid-show tonight.
451270	460395	And we'll talk about why that would happen all after this lovely introduction featuring that same introduction you've heard all year long, which we desperately need to change.
460435	461235	But you know you love it.
462056	464017	We'll be back with more Orange Lounge right after this.

579482	581563	You know, the chatroom's saying that we forgot Festivus.
582124	583004	Fuck Festivus.
583605	584125	Fuck it, right?
584145	584926	And it's stupidly late.

585586	586567	We are live!
586607	590949	And this is episode number 167 for this December the 18th of 2005.
591029	595232	You know, I'm sorry, but it's not a holiday unless they have a greeting card for it.
595292	596473	And I don't remember seeing a...
596991	599352	Happy Festivus cards at the end.
599492	602433	If Hallmark can make a dollar off of it, there's probably a card out there.

603994	604734	Uninterrupted, please.
604774	605054	Thank you.
605655	612297	You're tuned in to Orange Lounge Radio, radio that gamers really want, and this is Orange Lounge Radio Live.
612677	618960	You're home for all the news and discussion on rhythm and music games, as well as the gamer community and the pop culture world.
619360	623802	Emphasis on pop culture stuff and us, our lives.
624262	632044	We're plugged in and fully interactive through our website at www.orangeloungeradio.com My name is Rob Roberts, you might know me as Skye.
632345	639167	Joining me as always are my awesome co-hosts in that corner, the happiest bunny on the farm, Miss DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.
640927	641828	She's actually not here.
641968	648049	She's on her way, but she wasn't in an accident, but she was like, saw one or something.
648269	649590	We've replaced her with a ferret.
649790	651010	Yes, we've replaced her with a ferret.
651290	652811	No, she'll be here, just a little bit late.
653991	655232	We don't know how late.
655573	656574	I think only a few minutes.
656814	658876	Because she called in a timely manner, so we'll see.
659477	662019	But of course, over there, the one and only Interrupting Loki.
662500	662780	Hello.
663080	664041	How are you doing, my friend?
665303	670908	Good so far, but I just ate burgers from McDonald's, so... That could change, like the weather.
670928	672670	That could change your mood at a moment's notice.
673551	673831	Yeah.
674412	675193	Well, we'll see what happens.
677165	679086	We may have some special guests tonight, I don't know.
679126	685909	I'm sure Xtafer will want to do a movie review at some point tonight because we did see Jesus is Magic, an appropriate selection for the holiday season.
686429	690211	And John's out there too watching the week-old Survivor finale.
691171	693412	And then Bugged is out there too playing on the computer.
693553	696494	So we'll see if we can get any of them in here during some of tonight's show.
696514	698175	I didn't realize Survivor's still on.
698875	700536	Believe it or not, they're going to do another one.
700556	703577	There's another one taping right now and they've got applications for the next one.
703817	705378	You know, my friends say I should be on Survivor.
706567	707408	DarkSakura
724144	725325	We're going to talk about the holidays.
725345	727407	We're going to talk about some Christmas Bomani news.
727447	728948	You know, a little Ultramix 3.
729589	733272	They keep giving free shit away on Ultramix 3, so I want to talk about Ultramix 3.
733573	734874	And some other gaming stuff as well.
734894	736095	I want to hear more about the Xbox 360.
739182	740724	I heard something kind of funny happen.
741444	741784	Today?
742225	742525	Yeah.
743966	746048	Had some people camped out overnight.
746068	746749	Surprise!
747850	748730	We don't have anything.
748750	749491	Merry Christmas!
750232	751153	The internet sucks!
752794	754956	So I want to talk about that and have a few good laughs.
755156	760461	See, I'm even, for the occasion, I'm wrapped up in a blanket here, and I've got a bottle of vodka in my hand.
760741	761802	And today...
762591	766894	We will be opening the gate to OLR Town, my town.
767114	767274	Oh!
767294	768455	Entire show.
768555	769075	Exciting!
769316	770737	Oh, OLR Town's gonna be open.
770897	771377	Yeah.
771397	775240	So, um, everybody that has Animal Crossing can come join.
775960	778822	Every time I play, I open the gates, but no one ever comes in.
779342	781084	I have to talk about Animal Crossing when we come back.
781344	782725	We'll talk about all that stuff when we come back.
783005	783225	Okay.
783285	785427	I have issues with Animal Crossing, I'll talk about that.
785447	790070	So start, so you need to PM your friend Code the Loki so he can get you added.
790470	795511	So, PM Loki with your friend code and your name and your town name so we can get you added.
795611	795792	Yes.
795992	797912	Alright, and then OLR Town will be open very soon.
798072	798272	Yes.
798432	798712	Alright.
800773	802233	We'll be back after this quick introduction.
802533	806594	Now, of course, since you know it is the end of December, it is mandatory Silent Hill time.
807155	809635	So we're going to play Silent Hill and some other winter classics.
810576	814637	So hopefully you've been a good boy or girl this year and you're going to get lots of video games for Christmas.
815277	815357	Um...
816707	821830	And if you haven't, well, then, you know, you'll be getting a computer virus.
821890	822210	I don't know.
823611	823931	We'll see.
825052	826333	We'll be back after this with more.
826753	829755	And I'm going to talk about why we're getting canceled mid-show tonight as well.
830735	831796	Live through Suspive's fault.
831956	832597	It's out of our hands.
832677	834538	We'll talk about it when we come back after this.
834738	835899	Mandatory Silent Hill.
836619	837900	Merry freaking holidays to you.
855527	863293	I'm up here drinking and toasting, it's such a special day, tonight, nightfall, I love you, wish

950029	953311	Can you hear me forever?
953711	956873	Do you feel the pain inside of me?
956933	962637	What is true?
962697	963757	When do we leave?
963817	967820	Touching back No one cares

1255916	1256356	Hello?
1257137	1257417	Hello?
1257457	1258157	Is this thing on?
1258197	1258718	Testing.
1259898	1260759	Testing 1-2.
1261339	1265282	I'm looking in the index, but I don't see anything for how to run a radio show.
1265382	1265862	Hello?
1266522	1267983	I don't understand this.
1268003	1269364	Does this thing work?
1269384	1270985	This thing reads like stereo instructions.
1271045	1271666	Is this on?
1271686	1272266	What the hell?
1274807	1276208	Orange Lounge Radio.
1276408	1278590	Broke Down Ghetto Bomani Radio.
1278670	1278990	What the?
1281053	1285476	and in that commercial you heard the lovely voice of DarkSakura there, who's not here yet, but she's on her way.
1285996	1287137	Now I'm getting a little concerned.
1287217	1288918	She probably usually would be here by now.
1288938	1290138	I hope everything's going okay.
1290699	1295401	I'm sure we'll get the full story as soon as she arrives, but as promised, I'm wrapped up in a blanket.
1295521	1298023	I'm celebrating the holidays the best, the only way I know how.
1298263	1301285	I'm wrapped up in a blanket, and I have a nice bottle of Guinness.
1301405	1303506	Actually, I decided against vodka.
1303526	1304267	I went for the Guinness.
1304347	1305847	So I have a nice bottle of Guinness in one hand here.
1307528	1309810	And I'm just thinking about some Yuletide greetings.
1311991	1313633	which I'm sure I'll be rambling off a little later.
1314734	1316537	Loki, how's OLR Town going over there?
1317523	1320025	Well, our one and only guest has just left.
1321646	1323208	Oh, how nice.
1324008	1325890	Glad to see things are swinging in OLR Town.
1326130	1339461	You know, you may have to, as you add more friend codes, and don't forget, guys, if you want to get into OLR Town, head on over to our chat room at www.orangeonestrater.com, click on chat, and send Loki a private message with your friend code.
1339501	1340762	I have a lot of them already.
1340802	1345546	I mean, I have to look and see who's in here, but I have a lot of people already added.
1346027	1348668	That were posting in, like, forums and stuff.
1348749	1349049	Oh, good.
1349389	1350930	So, let's see who we got here.
1350950	1352330	Nah, I'll just, we'll just take your word for it.
1352350	1353331	You don't have to name them all off.
1353371	1354031	Yeah.
1354111	1361075	If they message you and, you know, want to know if they're on the list, you can tell them if they're there or not or get them out of... Now, are you close to maxing out your list just yet?
1361135	1362896	Have you maxed out the list there on Animal Crossing?
1363256	1363477	No.
1363737	1365978	I've only got about seven people.
1367321	1373944	I have Dan, I have Milty, Black Lab, Jason, Harold, you, and Jamie.
1374204	1381927	You know, I haven't touched Animal Crossing in probably about five days now, which is kind of sad, because I was all into Animal Crossing.
1382167	1395232	Like, I was so up and ready to play Animal Crossing, and I was digging all around town trying to find a copy of Animal Crossing, and I went everywhere I could, and trying to get a copy of Animal Crossing, and...
1397287	1397707	DarkSakura is here!
1417097	1419398	Mother Nature can bite my abundant ass.
1420298	1421139	Your abundant ass?
1421159	1421659	What happened here?
1422039	1422719	You want a sip, honey?
1423239	1423900	Okay, alright.
1425160	1425600	Alright, anyway.
1426341	1430902	We'll talk about our week and day is usually how we start off the show.
1430922	1434324	Since DarkSakura is getting situated, we'll go over to Loki and see.
1434444	1435164	Loki, how was your week?
1435184	1435624	How was your day?
1436805	1439426	My week and day, pretty uneventful.
1440886	1442147	Just still been fighting the cold.
1443349	1446290	This week we actually found out though that we're going to get a lot of time off.
1448311	1453454	They're giving us the Friday and Monday, you know, around Christmas and New Year's.
1453534	1457515	So actually this next week I work four days and the week after I work three days.
1459056	1459576	So it rocks.
1459796	1460597	Must be nice.
1461077	1461657	Must be nice.
1461837	1464659	And a $250 gift card for cash.
1467400	1470781	Other than that, I've just been playing a lot of Animal Crossing actually.
1470941	1472022	Not too much in the
1472674	1474415	Can you do friendly fire on Call of Duty 2?
1503687	1507548	Um, well, we played Deathmatch, so I suppose you could.
1508268	1519511	In the single-player mode, though, because I was watching Extifer play a demo on one of those Xbox 360 kiosks at, like, Circuit City or whatever, and I kept telling him, shoot that guy in the back of the head, shoot your friend in the back of the head, I want to see blood, I want to see blood.
1519951	1522111	And, like, he said he was trying to do it, but it wouldn't work.
1522191	1524352	But, you know, he might have just not been doing it right.
1524512	1529033	But I know that it's really fun, and I like the way that they do the maps where they don't show where each player is.
1529775	1535722	But when you fire your gun, a little blip goes on your screen showing you which direction the sound came in.
1536302	1537103	And that's really cool.
1539165	1547695	But other than that, I'm actually going to try to play some more games while... Let's see here.
1550536	1551116	Thanks for watching!
1564928	1565689	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
1594136	1604341	What's actually going on is that Live 365 is doing rotating outages, and they've been doing them all weekend, and we think we've missed it for tonight, but we're not sure.
1604741	1611764	So if kids, at 8 o'clock, the station goes down, we ain't coming back tonight, because Live 365 is doing rotating outages.
1611824	1612645	I don't know what the hell they're doing.
1612665	1617487	They're moving their servers to a new thing, a bigger, better, stronger, faster, harder server.
1617567	1618087	I don't know what it is.
1618127	1619188	We need to move them to Sweden.
1619488	1626873	So whatever they're doing, they're moving their servers, and if we happen to be on one of the lucky servers that's getting moved tonight, we will be off the air at 8 o'clock.
1627193	1630295	So if the show goes down at 8 o'clock, we ain't coming back.
1630495	1631076	So sorry.
1631856	1635739	But hey, life sucks sometimes, and Christmas sucks when you've been bad.
1636439	1638861	So, anyway.
1640962	1642363	Where are we at show-wise?
1642383	1642803	I'm sorry.
1643344	1645505	Please do it with a mouthful of burrito.
1645685	1646065	Oh, okay.
1646686	1647206	How was your week?
1647226	1647626	How was your day?
1647847	1648247	Burrito.
1648267	1648407	Burrito.
1649124	1651245	Her week and day is going to get a lot better.
1651585	1653366	I've been trying to get this forever.
1653586	1654967	This was going to be a wedding gift.
1655127	1658128	Now it's actually a Christmas present.
1658508	1665771	I got the last one, the actual display model, but... Oh, right on.
1665932	1666972	I have football lacrosse.
1667012	1668753	That means Dan doesn't get to play the PSP anymore.
1669153	1670153	Did that actually come out?
1670334	1670534	Yes.
1670554	1670794	For real?
1671014	1673315	Oh, I want to see this thing you've been talking about.
1674181	1679383	I'm gonna have your present at the end of the week because I didn't go shopping last week as I had finals!
1701877	1702398	That's alright.
1702678	1703839	Oh, and this will be your week and your day.
1704160	1705601	Yes, finals kicked my ass.
1705701	1710446	However, I got feedback on my second to last illustrated project and I made a 95 on it.
1711367	1712008	Because I'm awesome.
1713247	1716608	He said that my Silent Hill cover looked really nice.
1717408	1718449	I haven't got my grade on it yet.
1718889	1724510	I got full points for my Dreamweaver project, and I haven't got the results back of my World Geography final.
1724730	1727711	Did you link the Silent Hill thingy-bobber in chat?
1727731	1728951	Because it was actually really good.
1729031	1732933	It's something that I could see actually being used on a PlayStation-type thing.
1732953	1737954	I linked it in my live journal, but I'll link it in the chat room when I'm done with my thing.
1738154	1742059	There's not everybody in chat stalks you, LJ wise, so you should probably link that.
1742079	1743340	Well, I also am friends only.
1745458	1754324	I had to fight the rain tonight because it was just really nasty I was sick before I left home, really icky and then I had to pass an accident and then I had to go to Starbucks and get a latte
1774414	1775975	I picked up brownie bites for everybody.
1776055	1779317	Oh yeah, I wanted a brownie bite, but I had to pass because I was in mid-sentence earlier.
1779497	1780058	No, right on.
1780898	1782359	And, um... No?
1782960	1783760	I don't think they have nuts.
1784541	1785421	I didn't know what they were.
1785922	1788243	Well, I will have to eat one and see if they have nuts in them.
1790625	1791766	These are nut-free, my friend.
1792807	1794328	They are the nutless wonder.
1795849	1796849	Just like... Never mind.
1798650	1799391	A fitting meal.
1801993	1803614	But, um... Thank you.
1805239	1812162	I also got DJ KK last night, which is the KK Eurobeat song, while I was watching Stargate.
1812762	1817024	Now, actually, Loki has OLR Town open tonight for our listeners to join in.
1817044	1820485	Okay, you have the little brat lost in your town, and I have the mama in my town.
1820565	1822926	Yes, I've been trying to get, yeah.
1823507	1827108	Okay, so we'll have to fix that at some point tonight, reunite baby and mama.
1827308	1830089	I have to find the baby, because baby appears every now and then.
1830390	1833651	Okay, well, I know where mama is, so I'll go to your town and rescue the baby.
1835197	1840619	I think DarkSakura put something trippy in these brownies because I'm feeling all warm and fuzzy.
1840639	1842399	That would be the stuff at Starbucks.
1842459	1843340	No, no, wait, that's the Guinness.
1844760	1846741	Yeah, I can't have that as I'm going to be driving tonight.
1847501	1850842	And I may have jury duty tomorrow, which I hope I do so I don't have to go to work.
1851482	1853063	Merry Christmas, you get jury duty.
1853163	1854003	How did that happen?
1854023	1858444	Well, because I missed it the last time and I called back to reschedule and I said, yeah, but I'm in school.
1858804	1861345	They're like, okay, well, we'll just schedule you for the week after finals.
1862265	1864006	And I hope I have it because I don't want to go to work.
1864967	1865548	I work for a bank!
1865568	1865808	Hallelujah!
1887623	1888243	Like murder?
1888403	1889163	Like double murder?
1889204	1892645	Not a double murder, but I'd like to get on like a suicide case.
1894927	1896588	How do suicide cases go to trial?
1897068	1898789	Because they have to prove it's a suicide for some.
1899489	1899609	Oh.
1899989	1901050	But with a jury trial?
1902191	1902411	Yeah.
1902451	1904232	Did you mean to kill yourself, corpse?
1904672	1905132	Well, no.
1905973	1908694	There's just ones where they need to prove it's suicide or murder.
1909315	1913737	I like those kind, but I don't like just the straight up, hack you, RR, die.
1914597	1915138	RR, RR, RR.
1916465	1921626	But I want to get in on a case because I, you know, I should have been a lawyer except I'm too, you know, lazy.
1922466	1926467	But I wanted, I love studying the whole process.
1926607	1927547	I like seeing it in action.
1927567	1928527	I love watching court TV.
1928607	1933488	Are you going to get up there and if they ask you, now DarkSakura, well, of course, that's not what they'd say.
1933508	1936229	They'd say, Jamie, are you a supporter of the death penalty?
1936269	1938790	And you're going to get up there and say, I am the death penalty.
1940650	1941950	Goods don't kill people.
1942590	1943010	I do.
1946261	1947523	I support the NRA.
1964721	1965221	That's funny.
1965401	1966561	Inmate Battle Royale.
1967322	1968802	Took all them fuckers on an island.
1969182	1970662	That was a movie with Ray Liotta.
1970682	1971062	What was it?
1971103	1971683	No Escape?
1972043	1974463	And he gets off the island at the end, if I remember.
1974483	1975424	Sorry if this is a spoiler.
1975444	1977504	If I remember right, he gets off to the island at the end.
1977924	1982005	I think that... I don't know if I want... I don't know if I want Kuki living next door.
1982665	1984886	I think that it would solve a problem.
1986606	1990387	And then the inmate where they don't get their freedom, that they get a much nicer jail cell.
1991927	1993588	And then they have to defend their title the next year.
1995396	1997858	Someone snuck into my town and dropped fruit at my feet.
1998819	2001321	No, I'm not.
2001481	2008927	I'm thinking about overpopulation in the jail cells and cutting down costs.
2009087	2010028	I'm a penny saver.
2010208	2012651	I'm frugal.
2012911	2018736	They should vote for me because I would kill more people and save you more money.
2019246	2027495	You know, I just saw a meme on Life Journal, which is the order of the presidency or something like that, where you can add your name to the list to be in line to be president.
2027895	2029937	I'll have to give you a link so you can add your name.
2029977	2038326	I think they're on something like 5100, that if you could kill the other 5100 people, which isn't very many when you consider the population of the U.S., you, Ms.
2038346	2040148	DarkSakura, could be president of the U.S.
2040168	2040649	No, because I'm not 40.
2043123	2046966	Apparently they've thrown that out the door in this thing.
2047106	2048087	It's 35, but yes.
2048407	2049948	That's a few years off.
2051969	2053450	Oh, I did one other thing.
2053771	2063097	Because my friend was DJing at Rapture on Friday and ended up going out to the club, which I probably shouldn't have done in hindsight because I was shaking by the time we got back in my car.
2063597	2064338	I was so sick.
2065219	2065399	But...
2067944	2071626	The Purple Wind The Purple Wind
2097583	2112906	You don't have to be beautiful Anyway And the rest of my week has been recovering from the plague And you are on the other side of the plague now
2113806	2115227	Hopefully, but I don't know.
2115327	2119970	I took my double dose of Vicodin last night so that I would sleep through the night.
2120910	2124472	And I couldn't get to sleep with like two shots of my Vicodin syrup in me.
2125053	2128135	So I stayed up and finally I'm just like, shit, it's been three hours that I took it.
2128215	2131617	So I took another dose and then went and laid down at 4.30 and woke up at 3.00.
2133325	2137406	So yeah, I slept most of the day.
2137806	2138807	Let's see, my week and my day.
2138867	2141668	My week has been very busy.
2142748	2144248	I've just been kind of going out and doing a lot of things.
2144288	2145129	I went to the movies.
2145389	2156592	I went with Extifer and some friends to go see Sarah Silverman, Jesus is Magic, which is playing at our local art house movie, and of course Sarah Silverman's the comic that likes to say fuck a lot.
2157512	2158133	It was pretty funny.
2159053	2161094	I'll let Extifer talk about it more a little later in the show.
2161694	2161834	And
2163877	2165698	DarkSakura, DarkSakura S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
2182562	2209390	from 14 years ago when I first played it is coming back to me and it's just that's all I care about right now so my village is going to be filled with weeds because it's going to have to wait until I beat Final Fantasy IV Advance and I'm making pretty good progress I'd say I'm about I don't know how far I'm into the game about five hours and how long was I game about 30 hours I'm about five hours into the game so as soon as I beat Final Fantasy IV Advance I'll be back into Animal Crossing again and then I'll join you guys in a while in our town um
2210523	2211683	Your town's going to be full of weeds.
2211743	2213004	I know it's going to be hella full of weeds.
2213064	2214424	Make sure you buy insurance.
2215145	2216245	I have insurance, thankfully.
2216425	2218226	I bought insurance from the dude when he came.
2218466	2220526	But I have yet to have a single KK song.
2220846	2222647	I've only paid off one loan on my house.
2223407	2224368	So, nothing there.
2227778	2236863	I was going to go to San Francisco yesterday, but the weather here has been kind of crappy here in California.
2236983	2245448	When it starts raining in California, people forget how to drive, and they're not sure what to do, especially when it starts raining hard and they start doing the flood watches.
2245488	2247088	People go crazy.
2247149	2248089	That's what's happening today.
2249190	2251891	So crazy, in fact, that we might go down mid-show tonight.
2254454	2254854	XBOX 360 XBOX 360 XBOX 360
2284594	2295484	The numbers for Best Buy leaked out to what they were going to get, and they were doing this Sunday sale that was advertised, and basically they were going to have the same allocations as they had when the thing launched.
2296885	2306835	So people were camping out, and basically the sources were said, do not pre-sell any of these, these are to be sold, do not open early, these are for the advertisement.
2307796	2308136	Well...
2309106	2311769	No, the Best Buy, of course, they didn't listen to that.
2311809	2315792	They pre-sold them some of the nights before and people camped out in the rain again for them.
2316473	2318835	And a lot of people were disappointed because, oh, guess what?
2318855	2321558	They sold them the night before and you waited for nothing.
2321618	2324961	But here, here's a nice compact laptop computer for cheap.
2325441	2326462	You want this instead?
2326502	2327223	You know, it's like...
2327919	2330721	So basically a nice bait and switch for a lot of the stores.
2331101	2342709	So now I heard that they just plain didn't get them because we were at a Best Buy here locally and I overheard a conversation about, yeah, all these people were camping out last night and I was like, oh, ha ha, they didn't get there.
2342729	2345651	That's the moment I knew, oh, ha ha, those Xbox 360s didn't show up.
2345931	2349754	Some kid on the internet played a practical joke on everybody, you know.
2349854	2352456	So they really did get more 360s, but they just didn't play something?
2352476	2353676	Supposedly they did.
2353736	2356758	They got a shipment in on Friday and they were supposed to hold them until the 18th.
2357759	2374326	Now the thing that was also funny though, and because this sold out so quick, and they did get them, there was rumors that they did get them, and people like, you know, waiting in line stuff, but this whole thing that they had pre-sold them, either the night before, just, you know, bad situation all over again.
2375707	2381530	However, if you didn't get them on this day, never fear, they're getting another shipment on the 22nd.
2383579	2385120	Oh, just before Christmas.
2385460	2385721	Yes.
2385881	2386261	You hope.
2386321	2388743	Now, is this coming from the same source?
2389264	2390425	This is from the same source.
2390505	2393308	And the source for this Best Buy stuff was an inside source.
2393348	2395049	And he's been the one that's providing.
2395069	2398573	I think he's the guy that provides Kotaku with all their information on Best Buy stuff.
2398893	2400455	It's all inside stuff.
2401916	2404839	So pretty much, yeah, the next shipment's the 22nd, supposedly.
2405285	2411389	It's nice that some stores are getting them, but I notice a lot of other stores, GameStop, are not getting their shipments in on time.
2412450	2414311	Just in time for Christmas, a third shipment to Best Buy.
2414331	2414852	That's hardly their fault.
2415232	2418474	I know, it's not their fault, but it's just because... Well, Microsoft's playing favorites.
2418775	2422697	Yeah, they're playing favorites with Best Buy, so... Must be nice.
2423658	2426340	Must be nice to be sucking the cock of Microsoft.
2427281	2430203	All I got to say is... Did you see Bill Gates and Melinda Gates?
2430643	2431784	And Bono from YouTube?
2431864	2433785	Persons of the Year for Time Magazine.
2433965	2434245	Nice.
2434265	2434826	Bill Gates...
2436595	2438716	Big fat mug right there on the cover of Time Magazine.
2438936	2440076	And nothing against Bill Gates.
2440116	2443839	I know he didn't single-handedly put out this Xbox 360 and cause a disaster.
2444159	2446620	But he sure makes a good target.
2447421	2450602	Yeah, but he is living proof that geeks can succeed.
2450862	2452043	And let me put it this way, though.
2452063	2455865	They really fucked up the whole launch of this system.
2456626	2457186	I mean, it's...
2458163	2458863	All messed up.
2459184	2463006	What would you say to people though that say every launch is fucked up?
2463066	2468489	There are some pretty fucked up launches out there, but I say the way they've been treating this one, it's been really bad.
2471804	2472365	Really bad.
2472585	2475007	I mean... At least the 360s work, right?
2475027	2475948	They do.
2475968	2476669	They do work.
2476889	2480772	So, I mean, the whole thing of, you know, they're all defective and stuff.
2480952	2482974	Mine's... I've had mine crash once.
2483515	2484596	And it wasn't heat-related.
2484736	2487418	It's just a glitch in the game because of the crash.
2487999	2488960	Because games were rushed.
2490141	2491062	No, not necessarily.
2491102	2493964	Games will crash every now and then when you try to do weird things with them.
2495826	2497367	It just crashed for whatever reason.
2497507	2497948	But, um...
2499298	2503040	I haven't had it crashed since then, and I've been satisfied with mine.
2503060	2507703	It looks good on normal TVs and stuff, and you don't really need a high-def TV.
2507783	2517229	I mean, you can, I mean, definitely you'll get the best picture out of it, but it's not going to suffer from having a normal TV, playing even four-player deathmatches and stuff.
2518029	2520791	Because it is higher-res, it's really nice.
2521351	2524793	When the screens split four ways, you can still see very well.
2524853	2525654	It's not like, you know...
2526491	2526751	and so on.
2551829	2552009	All right.
2552730	2554812	Well, kids, we are going to take a quick break.
2555553	2560818	Since we already did our winter-themed break there at the start of the show, we're going to just do some random stuff here.
2561318	2565602	And when we come back from this break, we'll get a check on what's going on in OLR Town.
2565662	2572709	I believe that DarkSakura is on her way to reunite Mom and Baby in OLR Town.
2572809	2573850	You're selling the baby?
2574070	2574651	What are you doing?
2577698	2582559	Tom Nook has offered 600 bells for the baby, so we'll see what happens.
2582759	2584260	Because Tom Nook would buy anything.
2584460	2586060	No, no, no, it's Crazy Red.
2586280	2588521	Because remember, we sell children on the black market.
2588601	2589181	No, that's right.
2590421	2590881	Crazy Red.
2591462	2592402	Alright, so we'll be back.
2592422	2594402	We're going to get a check on what's going on in Noel Our Town.
2594642	2596763	We'll talk about some stuff going on in the music game world.
2597243	2601524	And plenty more when we come back tonight here on Orange Lounge Radio.
2656501	2657850	Thank you for watching!
2710876	2712925	If you can't say goodbye

2966184	2973448	So uncensored that even Tom Brokaw could get a job with us.
2973609	2974969	Orange Lounge Radio.
2975650	2979592	Welcome back boys and girls to Orange Lounge.
2981173	2984816	In that break you heard the Twilight Zone Midnight Special.
2985656	2986697	If you can say goodbye.
2987694	2991436	and the Rizlem remix, which people for no good reason were chatting about in our chat room.
2991816	2993357	So I thought I'd throw that in there.
2993377	2994657	Yeah, the Rizlem remix kind of sucks.
2994757	2997058	I don't know why people were talking about it, but they were.
2997098	2998799	The original Rizlem is so, so much better.
2998819	3002581	I mean, it's not that the Rizlem remix is awful, but it is.
3003922	3004202	It is.
3005142	3005422	Anyway.
3007363	3009224	Of course, you can join our chat room and get in on the fun.
3009364	3010805	www.orangeonstrater.com.
3010825	3011365	Click on chat.
3011685	3013526	Anything new going on in OLR town?
3014206	3014507	Nobody?
3014787	3015167	You know what?
3016798	3024321	Everybody fucking wanted to say, or was saying to us, oh, you gotta do the Animal Crossing thing and open up your town and we'll all visit.
3024341	3025962	Here we are, ghost town.
3026002	3028563	I think tumbleweed is rolling by in OLR town as we speak.
3028583	3032765	However, Wonder Dog Harold did leave me quite a bit of fruit at my feet.
3032805	3033365	Well, that's good.
3034286	3034806	Fruit is good.
3034866	3037887	Lots of peaches and pears, so I'm very thankful for that.
3037927	3038307	Good deal.
3039168	3043990	But yeah, I've got like what a few people added, but no one's visiting.
3045040	3047422	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3067329	3069030	45 minutes until we get the plug pulled on this, kids.
3069250	3069630	We'll see.
3069890	3070890	Or at least we'll see what happens.
3070950	3071290	We don't know.
3072350	3075091	Anyway, we are going to open up the Skype line in a little bit.
3075451	3079072	I understand a brand new version of Skype actually just came out.
3079092	3079752	They're up to Skype 2.0.
3080532	3083093	We do not have that Skype version installed over here yet.
3083133	3086053	I guess Skype 2.0 adds webcam to it or something.
3086653	3089554	Of course, we at OLR, we threw away our webcam because it sucked.
3090154	3092095	Hopefully we'll have a new one eventually, but for now...
3093973	3094294	DarkSakura
3108499	3116427	All right, so we are going to open up the skyline a little bit, but I do want to talk a little bit about some Bomani news, some things going on out there in the world of the DDR.
3117127	3122733	First things first, there is going to be a soundtrack coming out for DDR Festival and DDR Strike.
3123153	3129259	It's kind of like a combined soundtrack, VWare, I don't really know what the hell they're calling it, but it's going to have a lot of the tracks from...
3129799	3131021	Festival and Strike Superstar
3145676	3147057	I don't think this song list is complete though.
3147077	3149018	I have a feeling there's going to be more to it.
3149078	3150059	I don't think this is it.
3165669	3166249	I don't know.
3166309	3166650	Very strange.
3181403	3182784	I actually wonder at all
3210681	3221150	If you're a hardcore DDR collector type person, then you'll want this soundtrack, otherwise it really doesn't do you a lot of good.
3221871	3223652	Because you can get the MP3s all over the internet.
3224653	3225073	Illegally.
3226849	3231812	I think this is kind of funny because have you visited the musicineverydirection.com website?
3231852	3236475	They have a brand new flash game that you can play on the musicineverydirection.com website.
3236975	3244800	And basically you go around and you collect these little icons, but you try to avoid the bad guy who's throwing, I don't know, little purple waves at you.
3245300	3245980	And if you...
3247561	3264782	I guess what you do is you store up these icons that you collect and then you unleash the moves or if you're in the Beatmania stage, you unleash your DJ power and it slowly converts the background from something boring into like a nightclub or a dance club or a karaoke bar or something kind of cool like that.
3265743	3267165	It's a little bit of a silly game.
3267705	3270087	But what they're doing is that they're actually giving away prizes.
3270147	3274170	If you get a high score, you can submit your score to the scoreboard, and they're giving away prizes.
3274290	3278474	Not to the top scorer, but just people who submit their scores to the scoreboard.
3278494	3281876	So it's a random contest, which I think is kind of cool.
3282156	3285279	But some of the people on there, oh my god, some of the scores are really high.
3285339	3288321	Some of the people are playing this game into level 35 and stuff.
3288842	3293425	I got bored of this game after... I'm visiting the website right now, so if you hear some stuff in the background...
3295345	3300147	I got kind of bored of it after like level 3, but I wanted to be able to show the folks in studio what this is like.
3300547	3305750	If you want to check out this game for yourself, it's called The Ultimate Club Promoter Online Game is what it's called.
3306070	3309651	It's located at www.musicineverydirection.com.
3310032	3315474	If you want to go directly to the game, go to musicineverydirection.com slash morphed.

3361781	3366544	I want to know what suckers they got to be the, uh, the captures for this.
3366584	3367205	That's a little silly.
3367245	3368166	Anyway, you get the idea there.
3368186	3371228	That game looks like the ultimate in retarded.
3371288	3372449	It's a little silly.
3372529	3374570	Okay, enough funk boogie.
3374590	3374870	Shut up.
3374890	3375231	Alright.
3376189	3377870	Let's see what they're giving away here on this side.
3377890	3379691	You have until January 30th, 2006.
3380491	3394438	If you get first place, you get a copy of either Ultramix 3 or Extreme 2, a copy of Karaoke Revolution Party, a t-shirt and CDs, which most of us all already own, except for the t-shirt.
3395338	3397179	And some of us even have the t-shirt.
3397199	3401421	My t-shirt is Beatmania, though, which I don't think is one of the prizes here, so that's kind of special.
3403615	3405757	MusicInEveryDirection.com MusicInEveryDirection.com
3428001	3430704	I could have not told you about that and had more of a chance to win myself.
3431505	3435348	But we're nice here at Orange Laundry Radio and we want to share with you guys what's going on.
3438932	3445919	Also in the news, one other little thing here I wanted to say.
3448381	3449483	Oh yeah, Songpack...
3451413	3458479	14, and SongPack 26 are out on Xbox Live Ultramix 3, DDR Ultramix 3.
3459440	3462723	SongPack 26 is rumored to only be out there for a limited time.
3462783	3464465	It's going to disappear by the new year.
3464845	3467548	So SongPack 26 is kind of like a Christmas present.
3467888	3473113	It's free, it's one song, it's a remix of Love Me Do, and it sucks.
3473553	3474994	It really sucks.
3475995	3478257	The steps are kind of fun though, so it's definitely worth a download.
3478277	3480018	And hey, it's free, so you can't complain too much.
3480679	3481139	Free song.
3483641	3484062	So anyway.
3487865	3493009	If you hit an animal crossing, if you hit start, you can do end the party or whatever, and that'll boot everybody from the village.
3494409	3496410	Anyway, Song Pack 14.
3497250	3502013	Song Pack 14 is out as well, and I'm doing this off the top of my head, but it has a new Neveraka song in it.
3502493	3504334	It has, I think it's called Evolution.
3504434	3505854	It has Gamelan Da Couple.
3506154	3509636	But I thought it was funny because they don't credit Gamelan Da Couple to Tomosuke.
3509676	3512797	They credit it to DJ Mojo or something like that.
3512857	3513118	I don't know.
3513138	3514818	They give it a different credit, which I thought was weird.
3516079	3521942	Also in there was a remix of Ghost Revival, I want to say.
3521962	3522042	Yeah.
3523322	3526764	and some other crappy remix I think was in there too.
3527224	3528605	Really nothing to scream about.
3529426	3531567	I haven't been too excited over these songpacks.
3531927	3538150	But judging from the general reaction on DDR Freak, it seems to be getting an okay reception, especially when it comes to the steps.
3538511	3539451	Because I will give it that.
3539531	3541792	The steps are something kind of new.
3542153	3546115	And especially in one song that I played, I want to say it was the Ghost Revival remix.
3547736	3549277	or something about Brazilian Anthem.
3549637	3552119	I don't know if that was a previous Bomani song or if that's just coming from nowhere.
3553600	3565008	They all have some kind of interesting steps, like patterns you don't usually see in DDR, which is kind of phenomenal when you consider they've done hundreds and hundreds of DDR songs at this point, and there's only the four arrows.
3565028	3566989	There's only so many different types of patterns you can do.
3567309	3574394	You kind of see some different stuff happening in these songs, so you have that to look forward to to download.
3575086	3576687	So check that out over on Xbox Live.
3578968	3579288	All right.
3579308	3586011	Now, I know you guys haven't had a chance to check out these song packs, so I wouldn't expect that you already have this up or whatever.
3587852	3589653	Anyway, we are going to open up our Skype line.
3589733	3592294	It's over at www.orangehonestradio.com.
3592314	3594575	Click on Interact With Us, and you can...
3596465	3597466	Call us on the skyline.
3597806	3598886	Also, we have a phone number.
3598906	3601588	I don't give out the phone number enough, but you don't even have to have the internet.
3601628	3603609	If you just want to call us, you can actually do that.
3604169	3608051	The phone number is area code 916-226-9067.
3608411	3610873	But kids, please get your parents' permission before calling.
3612093	3614495	Otherwise, when the phone bill comes in, you might be in big trouble.
3616115	3617196	So the skyline is open.
3617216	3618797	There is a new version of Skype out.
3619457	3619897	However...
3622361	3626683	We don't know if it's widely out there yet.
3626703	3627964	A lot of you guys probably don't have it.
3628004	3628504	We don't have it.
3629185	3630525	We're getting a call, so let's go to it.
3632146	3633707	Hello, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
3634287	3635248	Hey, Skye, Siggy here.
3635648	3636388	Hey, how you doing?
3636408	3636949	What's on your mind?
3637829	3646634	Well, I just want to say, you know, Christmas is already coming in a week, and, you know, for Christians over there, Merry Christmas to everyone.
3649771	3652252	and a happy holidays to you too, my friend.
3652292	3657294	Christmas, Hanukkah, Kwanzaa, Festivus, whatever the case may be for you folks out there.
3657674	3659295	A politically correct winner to you.
3661696	3667498	Have you ever watched the video of Love Is Dreamin' Us, you know, the beat from the Beatmania US where LED is playing?
3669358	3669999	What song again?
3670059	3670839	Love Is Feelin'?
3671359	3672280	Love Is Dreamin' Us.
3672380	3673340	Oh, Love Is Dreamin' Us.
3673460	3674320	No, what is this about?
3675201	3678542	Oh, Love Is Dreamin' Us is confirmed for Beatmania US.
3683075	3683796	Okay, right on.
3686017	3686597	So what's this?
3686637	3689479	There's a video of him out there actually playing it on the internet?
3689519	3690099	Or what's going on?
3691400	3696684	Yeah, he did play Love is Dreamin' this.
3696924	3704208	He plays on the Player 2 side, and he got an A for playing it, even though it's 134k on his score.
3704709	3705929	Where did this video come from?
3705989	3709272	Was it him playing on an arcade machine, or was it him playing on Beatmania USA?
3709352	3710092	Where was it taken?
3710352	3711453	What is this going on here?
3712737	3722061	I think somebody linked it on Bimani Style or VG Army where LED is playing Beatmania US with a 2DX controller.
3723601	3725102	With one of the official ones?
3725942	3726943	Yeah, the KOC one.
3727263	3728623	Oh, that's pretty cool.
3730804	3732705	And they haven't altered it or anything?
3732745	3735326	I mean, it's exactly as the Japanese one?
3736066	3736927	Like video and everything?
3737327	3739268	The video itself is exactly from the Japanese.
3740908	3742129	I think you just cut out a little bit.
3744983	3746084	We were losing you a little bit there.
3746164	3747286	I think you're back here.
3747346	3748167	You're here for a minute there.
3748447	3749388	Yeah, I can hear you.
3749508	3750610	Okay, that's weird.
3751611	3756077	Okay, so it has the same video and everything, so not a lot's changed there.
3756778	3757519	Nothing's changed.
3758792	3765677	Okay, so the only thing that made me disappointed was the scoring, so I think they better tune that up to the standard.
3765997	3767498	Did it have the art at the end?
3769359	3770320	Oh, the score result?
3770720	3770920	No.
3773001	3776524	Is it an early build of the game, or are they thinking it's the final build, or what?
3777704	3779245	Some semi-final build.
3780166	3780946	Okay, interesting.
3781227	3782607	It's the last purple interface.
3783548	3786310	How are you feeling about Beatmania USA at this point?
3787062	3787963	Hmm.
3788824	3801736	If they don't put any goalie background result videos, I mean background images of goalie arts, I don't think I'll, you know, I'll think about buying it or not.
3802897	3804238	But what about those new controllers?
3804258	3805539	You know, the rumor of the new controllers.
3805719	3808002	Well, you probably have an arcade style, so what do you care, right?
3808022	3808082	Hmm.
3809178	3811259	Well, KOC, not Arcade Stock Controller.
3812799	3817801	But the rumor is that the Konami controller they're going to release here stateside is better than the one in Japan.
3818521	3821622	I heard from Floatwalker that it's going to be spring-loaded.
3822342	3823422	Mmm, interesting.
3824642	3827443	And of course, all this kind of stuff is a matter of preference as well.
3827483	3832005	There's nothing to say that one is better than the other, because that all kind of stuff is relative, but...
3834952	3835712	I don't know.
3835752	3851636	I mean, if it doesn't stick as much and they do a different kind of thing with the keys so the buttons don't stick, they'll do that whole thing, or it has a slightly different look maybe to it or whatever, it could be a more widely popular controller.
3852556	3852876	We'll see.
3852896	3856357	Speaking of sticking, I just noticed on my controller...
3857137	3868660	Like, I don't exactly press the center of the key, but I mostly, on the white keys I press the top, and then the black keys I press on the bottom, and then there are like scratches that causes the, you know, that causes the stickiness.
3871557	3872998	You should do what I did with mine.
3873018	3874218	Drop it off the top of the van.
3874258	3874978	It's never broken.
3876979	3878580	I can't imagine how that worked.
3879280	3879920	That would kill me.
3881261	3887383	It happened at Anime Expo 2001, I think, which is when I first got my controller.
3888084	3892625	And I was unloading it from the van, and it stuck up at the very top, and it fell face down.
3893566	3898588	But my controller has never stuck, except one key, and I cleaned it, and it worked.
3899568	3903450	It's like my controller is the super controller of all 2DX controllers.
3903530	3906932	I'm thinking the Virgin Mary lives in your controller or something because that's a miracle.
3907392	3910894	I know, I should probably, you know, take a picture of the circuit board and say, look, it's Jesus.
3911434	3912554	Yeah, you really should.
3913355	3915216	Have you ever tried to bash something on DarkSakura?
3916069	3916549	To do what?
3917129	3917989	The Vaseline mod?
3918349	3919030	No, I haven't.
3919070	3920750	All I've done is just clean the contacts.
3922070	3926131	I've been doing it every two weeks whenever I play 2DX.
3927631	3928511	And it works fine.
3929331	3935912	I actually never had any problem with my... It was only one of them that stuck, and that was the one that I would always slam on with my thumb.
3936913	3940853	And I just rotated the keys, cleaned them out, worked just fine.
3942434	3944734	Now, what bothers me is playing on the shaved ones.
3945829	3946970	I don't like shaved keys.
3946990	3947730	That's irritating.
3947830	3955054	And I don't actually like the ones where they put the little bit of rubber or foam under the key to press the contact up.
3957075	3957795	That's not comfortable.
3958215	3963438	Sorry, it's just really funny because you guys are talking about putting Vaseline on your keys and shaving it and all this other stuff.
3963458	3965179	You are a pervert, Mr. Rob.
3965199	3967340	My mind is going right to third grade.
3967960	3970782	Can you actually use KY for the mod as well?
3971162	3973463	I'm sure KY would work just as well as Vaseline.
3978516	3981359	I'm going to shave my controller and put KY all over it.
3984601	3985262	Where's the spirit?
3985282	3986403	I need to hit Bob with something.
3986743	3988604	I was having it sit in for you earlier.
3990566	3990946	I had it.
3991186	3995950	Apparently several people in our chat room want ass.
3996531	4000093	Lube up those controllers, kids, and go to town.
4000113	4003336	I do have a lot of apples.
4003356	4003536	All right.
4003556	4004557	Siggy, I'm going to go ahead and let you go.
4004597	4005598	Any final thoughts, my friend?
4006297	4013159	Well, nothing much else to say, but hopefully next year you get a Skype 2.0 so you can see what I really look like.
4014980	4023262	I fear some of our listeners, I mean, not you so much, my friend, but some of our listeners might be listening to us in the nude, or God knows what.
4023302	4025083	I don't know if I want that webcam on everybody.
4025503	4025623	Right.
4025643	4026023	So we'll see.
4027464	4027804	All right.
4029804	4031765	All right, my friend, I'm going to let you go so we can get to another call, okay?
4032148	4038252	Yeah, and happy new year to Orange Lounge Radio in case we don't see each other.
4040033	4044917	We're going to do something next week, but it's not going to be a live show, but we should be here in two weeks.
4045077	4045377	I don't know.
4045397	4048399	I have to talk to the crew about that when we're on a break or something.
4049280	4051661	But happy new year to you as well.
4051781	4053002	Have a good holiday season.
4053602	4053803	Yeah.
4054043	4054263	All right.
4054963	4055183	Later.
4055384	4055644	Take care.
4055664	4055724	Bye.
4057827	4061528	All right, we're going to do one more call here, and then we're going to take a break and try to get some frickin' air in here.
4062188	4066789	I actually turned on the air conditioner, so the people out front are going to kill me because it's cold out front, but oh well, they can deal.
4067549	4068429	Let's go to another break here.
4068449	4070069	That's what blankets and jackets are for.
4070910	4071770	Not a break, a call.
4071830	4073010	Hi, you're on Orange Lawns Radio.
4074310	4074650	Hello.
4074950	4075670	Hi, who's this?
4076911	4077691	Xander from Florida.
4077951	4079211	Hello, Xander from Florida.
4079231	4079891	What's on your mind?
4081552	4083112	Uh, not a whole lot.
4083412	4083512	Um...
4085578	4087600	Have an interesting anecdote, if you're willing to hear it.
4088401	4089242	An anecdote?
4089362	4090784	We haven't heard... Okay, sure, why not?
4091224	4092746	It's a short one, so don't worry.
4092966	4094147	Alright, what's on your mind?
4095268	4095508	Okay.
4097130	4100013	I'll admit, I'm a bit... I'm a bit of a fanboy.
4100974	4102996	Up to... A fanboy of Orange Lounge Radio?
4103016	4103716	That's really sweet.
4103936	4104477	Oh, I'm sorry.
4104717	4105457	Fanboy for what?
4106078	4118187	Sort of, but... I'm a bit of a Sony and Nintendo fanboy, and for a while I was kind of down on the PSP, but I never played it, right?
4118647	4118927	Okay.
4119428	4124651	Just reading stuff on the internet, it's like, oh yeah, I don't like any games on the PSP, blah blah blah.
4125962	4130683	But since I don't really have any kiosks, I never really got a chance to play it or anything.
4130984	4133384	Okay, I mean, I'd seen it, but I never really got a chance to play it.
4134185	4144428	So, let's see, two days ago, I was at this Christmas party with my friend, and he's a Nintendo fanboy, and he had a DS for a long time.
4145548	4148169	And it broke for a second time somehow.
4148409	4150050	He must be abusing that thing if it's breaking.
4150070	4151450	I don't know how, but he's breaking it.
4151770	4156060	He's shaving it and using KY apparently on it, which you shouldn't do with a DS.
4156160	4160669	You can do that with a 2DX controller, but please kids, do not shave and lube your DS.
4160930	4161672	It does not like it.
4163664	4164144	Anyways.
4164985	4170589	If the animals in Animal Crossing are asking you to shave your DS, just seriously, it's time to go outdoors.
4171109	4172550	It is time to go out in the real outdoors.
4172790	4173531	I'm sorry, go ahead.
4174371	4175532	It broke for the second time.
4177934	4178414	Anyways.
4179515	4181596	So he gets it, and he brings it.
4181636	4184738	He buys Tokobots and a few UMDs and stuff.
4186199	4190282	So he brings it, and I start playing it, and I'm like, hey, this is actually pretty fun.
4191683	4191763	Um.
4193021	4202443	No, I mean, it doesn't necessarily have, it's not, it doesn't have all the games that are my taste, but, you know, I don't expect that.
4203183	4205204	But I actually had some fun with it, you know.
4206224	4216646	So, I mean, I guess, really, you shouldn't diss a system, even if you look at the games, and you look at the reviews, and they all suck.
4217879	4219181	Don't listen until you play it.
4220282	4220743	Seriously.
4221504	4223026	Yeah, unless it's an N-Gage.
4223126	4223807	We need to add that.
4224729	4230657	However, you draw some interesting parallels here because you could say the same thing about an Xbox 360, no?
4232301	4234842	Well, I'm anti-Xbox.
4234942	4236262	I know, because you said you're Sony.
4236342	4238983	I mean, I have played Xbox, though, and I think that's the difference.
4239643	4253268	What's interesting about this, and I'm kind of just thinking out loud here, this is all kind of coming together as I'm sitting here talking, which is not normal for me to just talk out my ass, but you got the PSP thing going on, right?
4253288	4253868	And the PSP
4254928	4263633	If you put the PSP and the DS side by side, and you want a system that is strictly the better gaming system, I honestly think it's the DS is the better gaming system.
4263693	4266174	But of course, it also depends on the kind of games you like.
4266535	4268836	I mean, the DS has a different type of game, so you got that.
4269136	4269777	But the PSP...
4271298	4280109	The PSP is a sexy ass system for one, but the PSP allows you to do so much else on it.
4280129	4283773	Especially when you consider this 2.6 firmware upgrade.
4283933	4286556	You either can upgrade your firmware or you don't upgrade your firmware.
4286857	4289240	You can upgrade your firmware and get podcasts.
4289600	4304451	and get pictures and get the internet wirelessly and get movies downloaded from the internet and get MP3s so it's practically like having an iPod or you can not upgrade your firmware to 1.5 and download that cool ass top down shooter.
4304831	4311776	You cannot upgrade your firmware and get all the homebrew applications including homemade shooters and emulators.
4312316	4316359	Although if all you want to buy a portable system for is to play NES games, that's a whole other issue.
4317619	4321342	So that's where the PSP really excels is at being a multimedia system.
4322042	4324784	So now flash forward to the current competition we've got going on here.
4325264	4326365	Xbox 360.
4326845	4330268	Not a lot of great games for the Xbox 360 right now.
4330588	4332089	Hopefully some good ones on the way.
4333058	4334319	Hopefully some good ones along the way.
4334599	4339482	But the Xbox 360 trying to sell itself as more as the multimedia thing.
4340103	4343705	The little white box that Microsoft wants in every living room.
4344106	4348749	Which is very interesting because that is how I see Sony positioning itself as well.
4349089	4351891	Sony wants to be that little box in everybody's living room as well.
4352231	4352872	Nintendo?
4353755	4355015	GameSpoiler
4374924	4376085	I think Iwata is a fucking genius.
4377005	4379526	I think he's taken the company in a brilliant direction.
4394333	4396614	Yes, but it is a big gamble as well.
4396694	4397114	It is.
4397494	4401175	But I think... They don't really have anywhere else to go.
4401235	4405136	If they just keep trying to battle Sony and Microsoft on their grounds, they're going to lose.
4405416	4408177	The revolution could crash and burn.
4408277	4414359	It could be another N-Gage and it wouldn't matter because they've still sold 50 kabillion Game Boys.
4414839	4419640	I think a billion is an actual number now because Nintendo has sold that many Game Boys in different forms.
4420220	4423002	In fact, there's still more Game Boys than PS2s, I think.
4423362	4423863	Something like that.
4438453	4440435	So, I don't know.
4440815	4441396	It's just interesting.
4441436	4448060	I mean, Nintendo has dominated the handheld market, and I really don't see anybody posing a real threat to that anytime soon, not even the PSP.
4448381	4451583	The PSP is bringing in a new market, in my opinion.
4451803	4456586	I don't think the PSP is getting the same people that the Game Boy and DS is getting.
4456707	4458308	Because it's not a gaming system at heart.
4458708	4458968	Right.
4459288	4461010	It's an entertainment-on-the-go system.
4461050	4461230	Right.
4464756	4467558	I'm getting yelled at in the chat room for calling the DS a Game Boy.
4467638	4469360	Okay, it's not really a Game Boy.
4469740	4472722	Technically, the DS is not a Game Boy, but give me this.
4473142	4475124	It does have a Game Boy Advance slot, right?
4475584	4480228	So that's what a lot of people are considering when they buy a DS is, oh, this will play all my Game Boy Advance games.
4480548	4487513	So while it might not be a Game Boy per se and it doesn't carry the Game Boy brand, it is the evolved form of the Game Boy.
4488134	4489155	But it still can't play Tetris.
4489884	4490845	But it still can't play Tetris.
4491325	4494046	But it could play if they re-release Tetris or whatever.
4494106	4499369	And since they re-released Dr. Mario and Puzzle League recently on one cartridge.
4499589	4501470	Did you notice they're not calling it Pokemon Puzzle League?
4501490	4502471	They're just calling it Puzzle League.
4502591	4503371	I thought that was very interesting.
4504472	4506273	Since they re-released that on one cartridge.
4506733	4509134	Has that come out over here?
4509194	4511816	I'm seeing ad banners for it on the internet, so I think it's out.
4512056	4515938	It's not a game I'm interested in because I actually have both games on other consoles.
4515998	4517499	It came out back in November.
4517898	4518198	Did it?
4519099	4520621	But it's not something I really care about.
4521201	4523283	Yeah, I didn't notice either because I already have both those games.
4523363	4524684	But I'm sure it's a great Christmas title.
4527507	4527767	Alright.
4528488	4530990	Anyway, Xander, appreciate the call.
4531391	4538958	I'm glad to hear that the PSP was, you know, you had a good experience with it because that sucks to be a fanboy of something and then get really let down.
4540560	4541421	You know what I mean?
4541541	4543002	And it's a bad thing to be a fanboy.
4543442	4547966	Because, you know, if you just stick to one thing, you'll never broaden your horizons.
4548266	4548587	Exactly.
4549247	4550668	Be careful when you get narrow-minded.
4550728	4552350	And especially in the case of Microsoft.
4552590	4555032	When the Xbox first came out, I hated it.
4555232	4561057	I thought it was a crap system because, remember the golden rule of gaming, the system is only as good as the games that are on it, right?
4561317	4567502	And the Xbox had nothing going for it until they started getting DDR, they started getting Fable, they started getting Halo.
4567822	4568903	And I like Halo.
4568923	4569664	I know a lot of people don't.
4570184	4571784	But they started getting some more games.
4572584	4572785	I know.
4573725	4577625	They started reaching out into other areas that weren't just sports and shooters.
4578045	4578305	You know?
4579146	4579746	But that's just me.
4579946	4580706	They had a Buffy game.
4581166	4582166	Yeah, and they did have a Buffy game.
4582846	4583586	Which is worth something.
4584446	4585947	Alright, Xander, we gotta let you go so we can go to break.
4586067	4587747	But thanks for calling as always, okay?
4587847	4588787	Any other thoughts for the listeners?
4589727	4590868	Your taste in music still sucks.
4591168	4591448	I know.
4592068	4594668	But I have a microphone and you don't.
4594768	4596188	So that's what it boils down to.
4596309	4597049	Alright, take care, buddy.
4597849	4598069	Okay.
4598309	4598549	Later.
4599540	4601562	Just for that, Xander's going to start his own radio station.
4601602	4604804	It's going to be Sky Sucks A Lot.
4606365	4606966	Hi, Extifer.
4607006	4607346	How are you?
4607466	4608987	Do we have a microphone?
4609007	4609988	We can say hello to Extifer.
4613203	4613563	Hello.
4613723	4614524	How are you, my friend?
4615504	4616645	I am fine, my friend.
4617225	4618326	Are you guys going out or something?
4618406	4619426	You have your sock.
4619527	4620567	I'm going to put this on and go.
4621147	4622968	We're going to Chipotle.
4623469	4624029	Yum, yum.
4624409	4624789	Sounds good.
4627491	4628572	Is it getting really cold out there?
4628592	4629592	Because we had to turn on the air.
4629872	4631133	We're burning up in here.
4631153	4631353	It's fine.
4631393	4632274	I like the coldness.
4633234	4635055	So you guys are leaving for a little bit so we can leave the door open?
4635095	4635535	That's good.
4635736	4637456	Did you want to do a movie review real quick before you go?
4637657	4638657	Are they waiting for you or what?
4639097	4641219	I could do a Diet Coke.
4641639	4641839	Okay.
4643192	4645392	Anybody else want anything from Chipotle?
4645473	4648333	I want some hot beans.
4648573	4649013	No, I don't know.
4649273	4650153	Hot beans?
4650734	4650854	Ew.
4651394	4654094	Do you want to do a movie review or do you want to wait until you get back or what?
4654294	4655355	Sure, I'll do a movie review.
4655435	4655695	Okay.
4656855	4657575	Let's do a movie review.
4657595	4663356	Because, you know, Live 365 might pull the plug on us tonight, and in which case, you know, we want to make sure that we got your movie review in.
4663836	4665036	Why would they pull the plug on you?
4665797	4667097	Because we're letting you on the show.
4668877	4668977	Oh.
4669017	4670798	Because we eat through a feeding tube.
4670818	4671938	What?
4672782	4673662	I saw Sarah Silverman's...
4693284	4695387	The Pussy?
4695908	4696408	What's it called?
4696789	4697750	Jesus is Magic.
4698932	4707544	And she's officially now my favorite comedian because she made jokes about waxed assholes and that was just like...
4708425	4709786	Sera Silverman's like...
4737905	4740747	No, there was 6 million people that died in that.
4741007	4743388	And her niece is like, no, what's the difference?
4743768	4748771	And she goes, well, 60 million is unforgivable.
4751692	4752733	This is great.
4752773	4754534	If you're easily offended, do not see this movie.
4754574	4756755	Yeah, she's so funny.
4757075	4759136	Everything is, nothing is off limits.
4759156	4760977	She talks about black people, Asians...
4761437	4790113	Jews, Women, Men, 9-11, Holocaust, AIDS American Airlines have a slogan Don't ruin all the jokes That one's the best because it'll make you like That offended people in the audience I don't need you alienating our listeners I don't care, I really don't care Your listeners like me enough to know that I really don't care So it was a good movie, I really liked it
4792075	4798199	The musical numbers were kind of weird, but... And then there was a weird masturbating scene in it, which was kind of weird, too.
4798399	4798920	Really hot.
4799100	4799780	Yeah.
4800261	4802783	So, but, otherwise, it was a good movie.
4803143	4803683	Go see it.
4804324	4806485	You may want to wait for it to come out on video.
4806906	4809388	Two thumbs up.
4809668	4814491	Two cocks up and a flaccid... Two cocks and a flaccid cock.
4815052	4816193	Wait, that's two cocks and a half.
4817389	4818149	Get out.
4818370	4818690	Get out.
4819070	4820010	Two cocks and a pussy.
4820050	4821071	Look, this segment's over.
4821191	4821451	Get out.
4821671	4821971	All right.
4825653	4827934	What kind of ranking scale is that?
4827954	4830396	I give it two cocks and a pussy.
4830496	4831396	It's a three-way.
4831656	4835638	It's a three... You're so weird.
4836319	4837279	All right.
4838200	4842442	We're going to go to a break, kids, and try to get some air, because we're dying in the hotbox.
4842882	4846224	And hopefully we'll be back, and either the plug will get pulled off... Hotbox.
4847694	4848115	Shut up.
4848797	4851502	We'll be back after this with more Orange Lounge Radio.
4852384	4854748	Hopefully we'll be back after this with more Orange Lounge Radio.
4876958	4880008	If you got a kid act like her father, if the baby ain't yours, then hey, why bother?
4880028	4880771	Don't try, boy.
4880951	4881473	I'm bad, boy.
5012542	5012822	On a day
5241559	5246403	From the Step Squad to Orange Cloud, this PDR sucks!
5246483	5246983	Holla!
5247003	5248144	We are the winners!
5255882	5258884	And that break you heard Inside Your Heart by Akira Yamaoka.
5258924	5260505	Before that, A Day Like Today from In The Groove.
5261566	5262667	DJ Simon with Air.
5262807	5263287	You get it?
5263427	5264728	Joke, because we said we're breaking for air.
5265349	5268691	And my baby mama from DDR Solo starting that set off.
5269732	5271013	Hope you enjoyed that mix of music.
5271593	5274755	Here we are back on the show and we may or may not get the plug pulled.
5274795	5277978	We'll see pretty soon here if we're going to get the plug pulled on us for maintenance.
5278038	5280559	So again, if we go down, we are going to be down all night.
5280640	5281440	So we apologize.
5282101	5288885	But we thank you, of course, for sticking with us and listening, especially after last week because last week was kind of sucky because we had the plague, all of us.
5289186	5294389	And it's so weird now because I don't feel sick at all, no remnants or anything.
5294429	5295170	And I thank
5295690	5299654	I still have the plague I know you still have the plague, but the mini-plague is gone
5321058	5322939	I'm going to take that Airborne stuff more often now.
5323079	5323979	That's some good stuff.
5324019	5325600	I'm going to take one of those every day, see what happens.
5326020	5327501	See if it makes me a strong boy.
5327521	5328642	You could just take a multivitamin.
5329482	5330382	I've thought about that, too.
5330462	5334304	But the thing I like about Airborne is that it actually makes a drink, kind of.
5334324	5335365	And the drink's not bad.
5335505	5338026	I mean, I've had worse things in my life, so we'll see.
5338306	5341728	It's one of those acquired taste kind of things.
5341888	5342188	We'll see.
5343140	5346241	Anyway, I'm curious here, because we're getting into the Christmas season.
5346321	5349282	First, I want to know, what's on your Christmas list?
5349702	5351623	I want to know what's on our host's Christmas list.
5351643	5352503	What's on your Christmas list?
5352803	5355124	Maybe gaming-wise, or maybe just anything-wise.
5355664	5359386	And what your plans are for this lovely Christmas break coming up.
5359566	5361927	Or Hanukkah, you know what I mean.
5361967	5363607	When I say Christmas, I mean all that, okay?
5364347	5366628	We are not going to be politically correct on this program.
5368089	5370950	We're putting it all under the label of Christmas.
5371790	5374891	which is probably not extremely politically correct, but you know how it goes.
5375311	5376931	So, Loki, I'll start with you, my friend.
5376971	5380232	What's on your Christmas list, and what are you going to do for the holidays?
5380252	5383153	I don't really have anything on my Christmas list since I've already bought my 360.
5383553	5389254	I just, probably an HDTV, I guess, if I were to ever get one.
5389434	5391955	That would be almost impossible because they're expensive.
5393215	5394815	But, other than that, I don't know.
5395195	5396516	There's not really any games I want.
5397636	5397656	I
5398539	5399660	I have to wait, I guess.
5399760	5404784	Dead or Alive, I guess I could try to go get that since that's supposed to come out this week.
5405725	5406965	Assuming it doesn't get pushed back again.
5407746	5408867	Just in time for the holiday.
5408907	5410908	They're airing the commercials on TV and everything.
5410968	5413570	Actually, no, I take that back.
5413630	5414411	It's not coming out this week.
5414451	5415432	It's coming out next week.
5416292	5416793	The 29th.
5417253	5419215	Just in time for the gift certificates and holiday returns.
5419235	5420235	Yes, exactly.
5421456	5423038	So, maybe I'll get that.
5423098	5425980	I'm not a huge fighting game fan, but it looked good, so...
5427003	5427504	I'll check it out.
5428805	5432568	Oh no, there's really not too much I want.
5433229	5438574	Just, I don't know, HGTV, I guess I could need one of those.
5438634	5439735	I need to finish my cabinet.
5439775	5442257	I need time to finish my cabinet.
5443638	5444699	It's been a while.
5445140	5446140	I need to finish it.
5447101	5448863	Get the other controllers done.
5448943	5453287	But I'm kind of holding back because I don't have any place to store them if I were to finish them.
5455532	5456473	Storage is a big issue.
5458034	5467479	Um, but as far as Christmas plans go, uh, playing a lot of Xbox Live, hopefully, because I did pay for a year of it, and I want to kind of get some use out of it.
5468440	5478086	Um, and also, I'm supposed to go to my sister's house for Christmas, but she's local, so, um, that's pretty much it, though.
5478326	5480167	It's just going to be pretty low-key.
5481228	5481888	Ha ha, low-key.
5482008	5482709	Ha ha, low-key.
5482769	5483189	Ha ha ha.
5483229	5483429	Yeah.
5486061	5487862	Wait, wait, wait, wait.
5516109	5517110	Let's see, what else do I want?
5517370	5519571	I kind of want an Xbox 360, and I kind of don't.
5519611	5522333	Like, you can wait, but if somebody wanted to give me one for Christmas, hey, I wouldn't mind.
5523313	5531158	I'd get that other Xbox out of there, get the other Xbox in there, the 360, because it definitely is pretty, and I do happen to have an HDTV, so it looks very pretty.
5531918	5533899	I already kind of bought myself an early Christmas present.
5533919	5538842	I bought myself a new phone, because my old phone, this is what I did last weekend, since we kind of ended up not doing a show.
5539823	5545066	I have a new phone here, and it actually takes video, which is an incredibly useless feature.
5545806	5546967	and so on.
5575886	5580813	She wants to see Brokeback Mountain, too, which I really want to see, of course, too.
5580893	5583036	But I don't think that's going to be out here on Christmas.
5583096	5584538	Isn't that a limited release thing?
5586982	5590526	I think they're afraid of releasing it in the red states, so to speak, because I guess...
5592569	5596493	People in red states, quote-unquote, can't appreciate a good gay cowboy movie.
5596533	5600276	But I've read the book, and there's more to it than the gay cowboy thing.
5600296	5601857	The media's really putting the spin on it.
5601937	5605080	It's just like, oh my god, it's gay cowboys fucking.
5605721	5608603	No, it's not gay cowboys fucking is not what the movie's about.
5608923	5610645	It's a tale of forbidden love.
5611225	5613748	Romeo and Juliet was a tale about forbidden love, okay?
5613848	5616290	That is what the movie is really about.
5616490	5617151	It's not about...
5618243	5621005	Jake Gyllenhaal doing Heath Ledger in the booty hole.
5621405	5623167	Although, that might be a plus.
5625048	5629291	DarkSakura, what are your Christmas wishes and what do you have planned for this Christmas?
5629732	5631433	I want a memory foam contour pillow.
5632634	5633655	Or a Sobakawa pillow.
5634455	5635236	Very, very much.
5636617	5640880	And I don't really want any video game systems because I already own them all.
5642501	5645824	I do want a copy of Emerald Dragon for the PC Engine.
5647523	5648564	I've wanted that game for a while.
5649744	5653426	And of course, Panorama Cotton for the Master System.
5654087	5654747	Good luck.
5655827	5658129	Someone must have tossed down $600 on me.
5658189	5659289	I am not supposed to doubt.
5660890	5662231	I also want a tapeworm.
5663952	5666433	Like one that won't kill me, but that will eat all my extra food.
5667614	5668934	I'd actually like my appetite back.
5669595	5670835	And I'd like to be over the plague.
5672016	5673537	And I want a hippopotamus for Christmas.
5675249	5681014	I want a penguin for Christmas.
5681094	5682875	I want a compound.
5684857	5686698	So that we can hole up in it and drink red Kool-Aid.
5688180	5688720	Sounds like fun.
5689501	5689901	Lots of fun.
5690942	5693224	And I need season 8 of Stargate box set.
5694145	5694645	Very much so.
5695746	5699009	And the Sony Ericsson Vodafone new one.
5699770	5700210	I need that too.
5700888	5705810	You know what movie, because you brought up a good point about hippopotamuses and the animals we want for Christmas.
5705830	5709872	Do you know what movie I finally saw because nobody would go see it with me in the theater?
5709952	5710553	Madagascar?
5710753	5710933	No.
5711673	5712433	March of the Penguins.
5713014	5714414	I finally saw it on DVD.
5714514	5716675	I want to see that.
5716996	5718997	You know what the big surprise was about March of the Penguins?
5719537	5719937	Boring.
5720397	5721078	Fucking boring.
5721558	5725860	I love penguins, love penguins, but the movie was very boring.
5726380	5727581	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
5755002	5758843	I want a coffee pot, like a nice one, that does lattes.
5761804	5766465	Sort of like the big machines they have at Starbucks.
5767265	5770986	And I want the Foamy The Squirrel DVDs, even though Foamy's voice gives me a headache.
5773327	5775147	Because it's all about the guy that works at Starbucks.
5777150	5778811	I didn't know they actually released that on DVD now.
5779052	5780733	Yep, they're from the Squirrels DVDs.
5780873	5783735	And actually I want the Squirrely Wrath t-shirt too.
5783895	5785256	You know, we need to release the DVD.
5785837	5786377	We sure do.
5787318	5789680	And maybe that'll be an upcoming event for 2006.
5790620	5791021	We'll see.
5791461	5793823	Have our own best of DVD release.
5794023	5794383	We'll see.
5794443	5795124	We'll see what we can do.
5796010	5798811	We've got a lot of stuff in store for 2006 here at Orange Launch Radio.
5799051	5799311	Yes.
5799371	5800171	At least I think we do.
5800291	5801572	Including me moving to Antarctica.
5801592	5803032	You know the t-shirt thing is going to happen.
5803052	5804733	I've got to talk to you guys about that after the show.
5804773	5806533	But the t-shirts are happening, kids.
5806573	5809234	There will be shirts very, very soon.
5809294	5811075	Like January soon, we're hoping.
5811115	5813596	If we get our logo done and everything, we're going to have shirts.
5813776	5814516	It's very exciting.
5814736	5818037	Because you guys have been begging us for shirts for a long time.
5818477	5820498	So we're going to make that happen very soon.
5821278	5822639	That's kind of our Christmas present to you.
5824226	5826227	because we love our fans.
5826587	5828368	In addition to doing this show all the time.
5831029	5831289	All right.
5831929	5835690	Anyway, well, it looks like we got past 8 o'clock and we're still going.
5836011	5841493	So I'm thinking that means unless Live 365 is being slow, we are safe from getting dropped tonight.
5841613	5842233	So that's good.
5842673	5844594	Let's move on into the cage match, boys and girls.
5845472	5849613	Let's do an Orange Lounge, good old-fashioned beat-down cage match type thing.
5852074	5855274	Alright.
5855634	5859095	The way the cage match works is we're going to play three songs for you guys.
5859415	5868518	And you guys are going to pick your favorite, and the winning song goes into rotation all week long on Orange Lounge Radio's money, music, and video game music program.
5868538	5870298	Okay, so you guys are just going to vote for your favorite.
5871480	5878210	Two weeks ago, since we didn't do a show last week, we had this song win and it's actually a DDR artist who actually won the cage match.
5880040	5881300	The artist's name is Tess.
5881961	5887202	It's Tess and the song is called The Second You Sleep, I Stay To Watch You Fade Away.
5887242	5888903	And we're going to go ahead and play this song for you guys.
5889143	5892944	But you only get a clip because it actually already won a couple weeks ago.
5893444	5894585	So you only get a clip of it.
5894665	5898846	And it's going for a third week, second win tonight in the cage match.
5899346	5901607	So enjoy or don't, it's your decision.
5901727	5902727	But it is last week's winner.
5902767	5905268	Here it is, song number one, Tess, The Second You Sleep.
5905408	5905588	Enjoy.
6016586	6020751	I say to watch you fade away I dream of you tonight Tomorrow you'll be gone
6058740	6060501	Wasn't that a great fade?
6060601	6061721	You ruined it the internet, Rob.
6062001	6065883	Song one there, Tess, I stay to watch you fade away.
6067183	6071625	Will it stand the test of the battle of two other songs?
6071685	6074105	I almost sounded like a Soul Calibur controller.
6074205	6075726	Two other songs here tonight.
6076146	6078727	Song number two is DarkSakura's pick.
6078967	6080948	DarkSakura, what did you pick for our listeners tonight?
6082270	6087571	It's a song I've been meaning to put in the cage for a while because we really, really need drum and bass represented.
6088592	6094873	And it's one of my favorite DJs and one of my favorite singers, and it's actually one of my all-time favorite songs ever.
6095693	6098754	It's DJ Crush and Estero with Final Home.
6100015	6104016	I've played it on my show a couple times, so our listeners might find it familiar.
6104136	6108617	DJ Crush with Estero, Final Home is song number two.
6108737	6109097	Enjoy!
6258309	6259645	Thanks for watching!
6392697	6397640	Song number two in tonight's cage match was DJ Crush featuring Astero with Final Home.
6398020	6403983	Let's go around and see if that was judged as being a good song or a poopy song by our judges.
6404343	6405584	Us, DarkSakura.
6405924	6407005	That song is sexy.
6407065	6407685	It gets a ten.
6408906	6410286	A sexy ten from DarkSakura.
6410346	6410527	Loki.
6410607	6412448	It's not that sexy.
6412508	6412988	It gets an eight.
6415763	6418144	Not As Sexy 8 from Loki.
6419804	6421605	I don't know if I would call that drum and bass.
6421705	6424086	That's trip-hop before I would call it drum and bass.
6424406	6426427	But DJ Crush is almost all drum and bass.
6426827	6428808	Well, that's a little more trip-hop to me, but it doesn't matter.
6428848	6429448	It doesn't really matter.
6429568	6430648	Call it whatever the fuck you want.
6430748	6431629	It's still a fine song.
6431729	6432129	I like it.
6433129	6436771	It's a song I could imagine myself having sex to, which is always a good thing, so I give it a 9.
6437491	6437891	Very nice.
6438631	6440872	Alright, let's get into song number 3 tonight.
6440912	6441952	Loki picked song number 3.
6442213	6443113	Loki, what'd you pick for us?
6444850	6446712	I picked something completely last minute.
6446812	6448493	I have not even listened to this yet.
6449674	6452416	So this is a suicide pick from Loki, basically.
6452476	6452836	I guess.
6453176	6459521	Well, originally this week I had wanted to pick a remix of the Contra theme for some reason.
6459641	6460402	And I don't know why.
6460662	6462504	I did download something, but it was too long.
6462924	6465366	It was like seven minutes long because it was kind of a medley.
6466246	6468088	But this is another remix.
6468108	6471010	This is actually from Contra Shattered Soldier.
6471510	6473652	And the remix is called Spread Your Fire Against.
6475051	6478414	At first I thought this song was called Spread Your Legs, because I just saw the spread your.
6478894	6480255	Oh yeah, Spread Your Fire Against Me.
6480335	6481817	It's by Brain Cells and Dennis.
6482517	6485400	It's song number three, and Loki better hope it's good, or else he's going to look like an ass.
6485680	6486841	I don't care.
6487221	6487781	Alright, here it is.
6487822	6488102	Enjoy.
6524302	6525383	Thank you for watching!
6544874	6554939	I hope that you live and there's no use to me And I know you're trying to steal your mind off of the TV
6586438	6587280	Thanks for watching!
6601265	6613610	We will try to verify why he's holding on There's no use in falling out, wasting our precious time They won't learn from their mistakes, so you need that to die
6637094	6639676	I was left in prison asking every threat to resign Die Die
6681665	6689576	A dreaded total fighter With a fucking US Army I'll look inside till you have enough Kill them all with no remorse, no!
6708058	6709262	Thank you for watching!
6728294	6729195	Song number three.
6729295	6730155	God, I love that challenge.
6730175	6738280	Song number three, Brain Cells and Dennis with Spread Your Fire Against Me, which apparently is a remix from Contra's Shattered Soldier.
6738300	6738640	Who knew?
6739340	6739760	Let's see.
6739861	6743022	Does that make you want to spread your fire or spread your hate?
6743082	6743423	I don't know.
6743923	6745043	DarkSakura, what did you think?
6745184	6748886	It makes me feel like I should worship Satan or something.
6749666	6750787	So it gets a minus 666.
6750827	6751027	Loki.
6751067	6751407	Loki.
6754355	6757397	It gets a positive 666 to counteract the minus 666.
6757637	6759059	So it effectively has a zero?
6759599	6759879	Yes!
6760379	6761180	Good thinking, Loki.
6761360	6762921	Good thinking.
6763442	6765904	That song does make me want to smoke crack and worship Satan.
6766644	6770287	But, you know, actually it kind of reminded me of Gwar a little bit.
6770647	6771408	And I started thinking about...
6772588	6790319	I know Gwar is a lot cooler, but then I just imagine these giant outfits, because the thing I love about Gwar, like, fuck the music with Gwar, but just them getting up in those giant costumes and thrashing about, where they all look like Shao Kahn from Mortal Kombat, and they're on stage thrashing about, is really badass.
6790539	6793381	And so I kind of thought about that, and that made me giggle a lot.
6793441	6798184	So that song gets like a five for the number of times I laughed.
6799318	6801580	Alright, but it's not up to us.
6802020	6803201	We are not the final judges.
6803301	6803742	You are.
6804102	6806904	You kids that listen to this program out there and are in our chat room right now.
6806944	6807865	You are the final say.
6808265	6810707	So let's see the three songs you get to vote for tonight.
6811107	6816492	Song number one, as a reminder, is Tess with The Second You Sleep, I Stay To Watch You Fade Away.
6823474	6831383	And song number two you can vote for tonight is DJ Crush and Astero with a song called Final Home.
6838371	6843958	And song number three you can vote for tonight is Brain Cells and Dennis with Spread Your Fire Against Me.
6851744	6852164	It's a good time.
6852184	6852764	I like it.
6852784	6853845	I hope it does well.
6853865	6854125	We'll see.
6854145	6855145	It's up to the chat room.
6855165	6856325	So send in your votes now.
6882386	6886128	Well, it looks like we didn't get the plug pulled on us, so we get to continue to do a show here.
6886168	6887389	How's OLR Town going?
6887409	6890511	Did you finally just close the gate and say, fuck you all, and now you and Jamie are playing?
6891051	6893072	No, but Harold's been the only one that's joined.
6893413	6898696	So I am taking this time to write OLR message in a bottle spam.
6898776	6899436	Oh, propaganda.
6899696	6900217	Propaganda, yes.
6900237	6901157	Good, good thinking.
6901398	6902078	That was my idea.
6903699	6904139	No, what is this?
6904159	6909182	You guys are going to spam Orange Lounge Radio across Animal Crossing World by what?
6909262	6909723	Using a bottle?
6909743	6910323	How does this work?
6910635	6914678	The message in the bottle, you basically write whatever you want, put it in the bottle and drop it in the ocean.
6914759	6921464	Message in a bottle, message... Penfold.
6922105	6922465	Shush.
6923786	6931252	No, um... It's like supposed to go to somebody else's random village, so they'll get... You should listen to Orange Dawn Radio because we said so.
6932854	6933234	Very cool.
6934035	6934775	We'll see if it works.
6936517	6937298	Alright, um...
6938760	6944225	Loki, after the cage match is usually where I go over to you and I say, Hey Loki, what's going on in the sim scene?
6944285	6949330	And you usually will say nothing, but I thought I would humor this tonight and see what's going on.
6950270	6951592	More sim file contests.
6951732	6957777	I'm actually, Stepmania is doing one, their official sim file contest through stepmania.com.
6958137	6958798	So that's interesting.
6958818	6962962	Are they encouraging people to use their own MP3s, or encouraging people to use commercial MP3s for this?
6962982	6963302	No, they're...
6964443	6971745	They're encouraging people to use royalty-free MP3s or MP3s that they have the permission of the artist to use.
6972485	6974965	So in other words, they will be forced to come up with something original.
6975545	6976385	Something original.
6976606	6977146	I like this.
6978226	6980226	And then, so there's a contest going on there.
6980746	6983727	And then I think OSC4 was just finishing up.
6985467	6986087	And that's about it.
6987908	6992229	Oh, and Siberia Style 3 has been released.
6992589	6993589	The Stepmania theme.
6995618	6996138	Thanks for watching!
7010677	7011017	That's it.
7011217	7012498	That's all that's going on in the world.
7012518	7016961	Well, tell me about something going on in the hack and crack world, because we've got to fill time here while we get cage match votes, Tally.
7017662	7021224	Well, apparently... Last call for cage match votes, by the way.
7021244	7031572	Homebrew stuff, they've gotten it to run now through version 2.5 and 2.6, using the same workaround that they've used to create that trainer for Grand Theft Auto.
7032092	7038817	And so they're actually using that to port Homebrew to the PSP on firmwares 2.5 and 2.6.
7040785	7046869	So what that means is probably there'll be another firmware coming out for the PSP to break all that stuff.
7048270	7056095	And then what'll happen is they'll come out with something else to break that and the cycle keeps going on and on.
7057716	7065401	And other things, there's actually been some pretty cool stuff for like the 360 being put on Xbox Live.
7066222	7070305	One of them being more downloadable cars for Ridge Racer 6, which makes me happy.
7070825	7071545	And those are free.
7072506	7075227	They've also added some music from the other games.
7075387	7080228	I saw some stuff, Warp Rider and stuff from I think Ridge Racer for the PSP.
7080608	7082289	I'm sure that was in other ones as well.
7082829	7084990	But there's a lot of music in Ridge Racer.
7085010	7088851	There's like four virtual CDs worth of music on there.
7089752	7091052	Just really good stuff.
7092449	7092529	XBOX360
7111986	7112627	It is pretty cool.
7113767	7114068	I don't know.
7115148	7115969	Cameo's pretty fun.
7116169	7117150	I've been playing that a little bit.
7117330	7117530	Yeah?
7117870	7118691	Yeah, it's pretty cool.
7119892	7121213	I am kind of digging it a bit.
7122334	7124355	It's a little easy, though.
7124695	7125496	That's what I've found.
7126056	7128058	But I'm sure it gets a lot harder throughout the game.
7128558	7129158	It's still pretty.
7131640	7133261	And then Ridge Racer is really fun.
7133401	7134442	I like that game a lot.
7134782	7138165	And Call of Duty 2, the multiplayer, is really fun in that
7138953	7141134	Just, I like the multiplayer a lot in my game.
7144796	7147838	And, I don't know, just overall pretty fun.
7148138	7150479	I'm thinking about maybe picking up another game here.
7151620	7153321	Not sure what I want to pick up, though.
7153961	7155762	Maybe Need for Speed.
7157843	7161805	Definitely going to get Dead or Alive 4 when that comes out.
7163006	7164166	Been actually pretty excited.
7164487	7166308	They've been showing some pictures for...
7168075	7168976	Blow up everything!
7169016	7170836	They sort of had a commercial like that for Mercenaries
7196198	7211464	Um, Mercenaries, when it came out, um, on the PlayStation 2 and Xbox, you know, I was the commercial, blow up buildings, blow them up again, you know, blow up tanks, fire rockets, you know, it was just the whole commercial dedicated to that, and it was great.
7212364	7214245	It's a great idea.
7215946	7218707	It's a lot better than those commercials that they have at the PSP.
7219227	7224609	It's like a nut you can play with outside, or it's like carpet you can watch outside.
7225256	7227078	It's like carpet you can munch outside.
7227358	7231301	No, well they have, like, they're talking about the PSP and being able to play it outside.
7231441	7233523	Have you ever tried to play PSP outside?
7233803	7236485	You can't see shit on the screen outside.
7236505	7238487	Well, to be fair, it goes for most systems.
7238627	7239567	You can't really see the DS outside.
7239587	7242910	Exactly, but why are they trying to push it that you can play it outside?
7242950	7245132	Which is why I never fucking understood.
7245232	7245752	Only at night.
7245872	7249075	What was that fucking game on Game Boy Advance that was the sun?
7249155	7250836	It was Konami, and you had to do the sun.
7251197	7252358	Yeah, I know what you're talking about.
7252438	7253278	Is that what it's called?
7253298	7253639	Yeah, yeah.
7254079	7254780	Fuck that game.
7255040	7256302	I mean, seriously, fuck it.
7256422	7256842	And it's here.
7257223	7259846	That was so stupid, that sun thing encouraging me to go outside.
7260146	7261608	I can't see my game when I go outside.
7263010	7268256	Well, actually, that's the way you had to play it for those old systems that didn't have backlights, though.
7268917	7269718	The ones that do, though.
7270018	7270719	You can't see them now.
7272799	7275001	The Chat Room requested some more happy.
7293374	7296738	So we have nothing but nauseously happy songs this break.
7297158	7299341	And for some reason I don't have Jenny Rahm in here, though.
7299381	7300082	I may have to fix that.
7300102	7300422	We'll see.
7301183	7307270	But I thought of something better than Jenny Rahm, and we're going to start it off with that really, like, annoyingly happy song from In the Groove.
7307490	7310934	So we're going to start off with that, and we'll be back with more Orange Andreo after this.
7530430	7531211	DarkSakura.com
7558568	7563132	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
7601207	7602228	We've got a winner!
7630641	7631363	Thanks for watching!
7750552	7756199	Mr. Random Person on the Street, who, by the way, is not an actor, what do you think of the Orange Lounge mainlining music in Moore's show?
7756499	7763427	The music is like being transported to just this dancing spaceship place.
7763767	7763867	It's...
7765279	7765720	on Earthly.
7765960	7769683	It's like being at a club, except you don't have to actually ask someone to dance.
7782250	7782810	Lucha Libre on Telemundo!
7808070	7809751	Telemundo, Telemundo, Telemundo!
7810191	7813093	I love that stuff, and they have the best talk shows.
7813473	7817575	Sure, I can't understand half the shit they're saying, but I can pick up enough words so I kinda know what's going on.
7820197	7821758	I do love Mexican wrestling.
7826340	7827561	La lucha libre!
7827821	7829662	No, anyway, forget it.
7831023	7832784	So, yeah, anyway, hi.
7834522	7835602	I don't know where that came from.
7836123	7842686	Anyway, we decided that since we did do a happy, happy bouncy break, that we will actually do a very dark, depressing break next.
7842986	7843706	So that'll be fun.
7843726	7846007	We're going to do our emo break next.
7846147	7847048	So that'll be fun.
7847088	7849489	We can kind of offset that a little bit there.
7851852	7865343	Anyway, now they're having a discussion here in the chat room talking about Sirius versus XM, which are the dueling satellite radios here.
7865683	7867945	Now, have you guys ever looked into getting satellite radio?
7868946	7871888	My new stereo is XM compatible, but I haven't.
7873339	7875080	You know that's funny because mine is Sirius compatible.
7875180	7877542	And I'm in the same boat where I haven't really decided to get that.
7877982	7879923	I'm tempted though with the Stern thing.
7880003	7884687	Not that I'm a huge Howard Stern fan, but I think he's interesting.
7884747	7887949	And I'd be interested to hear what he has to say on the new show.
7887989	7889630	But I'm sure it'll be all over the internet and stuff.
7890090	7892132	So I've been tempted to get Sirius.
7892472	7895614	But DarkSakura says that we should get on satellite radio.
7895654	7896554	And I tend to agree.
7896835	7897955	We should be on satellite radio.
7898276	7901218	But you know Adam Curry has a show on, I think it's Sirius.
7901458	7903039	And he does a show about podcasting.
7904960	7907421	and I think he plays clips from different podcasts.
7908301	7913103	And I've actually submitted our show, I don't know, months ago, I submitted that little promo we did to the show.
7913143	7913983	I've never heard back.
7914323	7921266	So, you know, the best way that you could hear us on one of these stations would be to email the fuck out of these people and say, hey, have you heard of Orange Orange Radio?
7921286	7922206	You should include them.
7922326	7923947	Syndicate, syndicate.
7924207	7928949	And it's tough, too, because when we first started our podcast, there was...
7929742	7956754	very few other gaming podcasts out there only a few people have jumped on the bandwagon early and very very few of them are still around I can only think of like I think maybe two other podcasts I can think of that have been around just as long if not longer than we are that are still going regularly a lot of them kind of tapered off but now there are literally like at least a hundred video game podcasts out there on the internet right now so it's tough for us to stand out from the rest you know it's getting pretty competitive out there
7957054	7957915	Thank you for watching!
7972887	7973808	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
8003673	8005674	We won that little thing, and that was nice.
8006135	8007616	And that was strictly because of our fans.
8009137	8011139	But we just want to have fun with this.
8012780	8015562	And we want to bring more people, because we're a very interactive show.
8015842	8020446	We like to think that's one thing that maybe sets ourselves apart from the others, is that we're a very interactive show.
8021567	8023148	Anyway, something to think about.
8024349	8026831	Shall we hear who won tonight's cage match, boys and girls?
8027051	8028352	Yes, let's!
8028693	8032396	The winner of tonight's cage match was...
8035109	8036589	Tess, once again.
8039230	8042551	Because everybody loves some generic trance in their life.
8043331	8044091	Enjoy that, Tess.
8044171	8045452	Actually, I like that song an awful lot.
8045652	8046432	Can't say a lot negative.
8046752	8048592	Although I was very disappointed at the voting turnout.
8048692	8049533	Very few votes.
8049553	8053734	This is the lowest voting turnout I've seen since Election Day.
8053754	8056414	Okay, so more voting people.
8056474	8057535	Shame, shame, shame.
8057575	8058195	Get the word out there.
8059252	8059532	All right.
8061353	8061933	Let's see.
8063334	8066115	I'm trying to go to our chat room there, www.orangemonster.com.
8066135	8069736	They're talking about... In the chat room there.
8070537	8071077	They're talking...
8072725	8076669	They're talking about, um, why are they talking about Don and Drew?
8077229	8082073	That podcast, that's a very, oh, maybe they're trying to talk about podcasts that have been around.
8082113	8084376	I'm talking about strictly video game podcasts.
8084396	8087478	I know Don and Drew have been around since, like, podcasting started.
8087498	8093704	That they were the first, like, big name couple that got on the, you know, the iPod thing and started talking about their sex life or whatever it is they do.
8093744	8094925	I've only listened to a little bit of the show.
8095285	8097768	I'm going to be honest, kids, I don't listen to a lot of podcasts.
8098729	8100450	I totally support podcasting.
8100490	8104113	I think podcasting is truly the wave of the future and I support it.
8104173	8109678	But as somebody who's trying to put together an original podcast, I don't really listen to a lot of others.
8110038	8114101	Which is a little bit of a controversial standpoint because you think I could stand to learn things by listening to other podcasts.
8114121	8117744	At the same time, I want to make sure our show is purely original.
8118004	8121467	Well, Yanni doesn't listen to anybody else so that all of his music is original.
8122248	8123169	But Yanni sucks.
8124489	8140318	Not really, I like some of Yanni's music If you're into, you know, screaming opera pigs No, I'm kidding Yanni's good if you like that kind of music So what are you saying, we're the Yanni of podcasting?
8140898	8152024	Only cooler Alright, anyway I'm feeling a little angsty So I think it's time to get into the FUs of the week What do you kids think?
8154232	8155113	You want to do some angst?
8156313	8157314	Angst up, yo.
8157334	8158575	Alright, let's do some angst here.
8159636	8162177	DarkSakura, of course, you know I'm always going to go over and start with you.
8162237	8164959	Oh, by the way, guys, you can submit your FUs of the week right now.
8165319	8173484	Go to www.orangemonstrator.com and click on chat and send a private message to Sky with your FU of the week, if you have an FU of the week.
8173765	8176787	But you know we've got to get ours out first because we are some angsty motherfuckers.
8177147	8180909	So, DarkSakura, why is it we do the FUs of the week every single week?
8181109	8182070	Grr, argh.
8195757	8199259	F you to, uh, the abundant amounts of rain.
8200640	8207543	Um, because, uh, you know, it just makes it really hard to drive when everybody else on the road is being a big dipshit.
8208404	8211706	Which is the case, I've passed something like three accidents on the way here today.
8212826	8218209	Another F you goes, of course, to the plague for not releasing me from its evil grip lately.
8219270	8219350	Um...
8220945	8226648	Another one goes toward my utter lack of appetite from being sick because I've dropped 15 pounds in a month and a half.
8227189	8230591	So like none of my clothes fit me anymore and I can't really afford to go buy new ones right now.
8232092	8246080	FU to the rock that flew off of the road and landed in my windshield and then cracked two days later so that now I have a big split across the lower half of my windshield from one end to the other and have to pay to have my windshield replaced.
8248143	8251687	So, uh, that really, uh, sort of hacks me off.
8252087	8256592	And, uh, an FU goes to the general stupidity on the internet.
8257072	8258494	But that's the expected.
8259074	8259935	Okay, I'm done.
8260496	8261276	Oh, yeah, one more.
8261917	8264340	All those people who misuse the apostrophe.
8264360	8265741	Fuck y'all.
8266842	8267102	I'm done.
8268103	8270406	Loki, what FUs do you have for us tonight?
8272359	8274900	I'd like to second the stupid driver FU.
8275020	8287964	I keep seeing, you know, this torrential rain coming down and people driving with their headlights off still or in the fog and they're driving extremely fast in the fog without their headlights on and then they wonder why they get in the car accidents.
8288425	8289405	Stupid people out there.
8290249	8304435	Um, also, um, I want to say if, fuck you to, um, the whole launch lineup for the 360, because there's not that much that's out there that I want to get, and I'm kind of dying to get another game.
8305375	8319061	Um, and then, finally, um, fuck Best Buy for just overall sucking, and, you know, unfortunately I do have a $100, um, gift card to Best Buy, so I actually go there, but...
8320529	8322170	We don't want no shortage
8350166	8358773	I would say my FU, I'm going to third the FU because it seems like, to driving, because when it seems like it starts raining in this state, people forget how to drive.
8359774	8360815	So FU to that.
8360995	8366560	FU to the fact that I've got like a million and one things I need to do this next week and not enough time to do it.
8368081	8380104	F you to just angst in general and not feeling happy with certain things and where you're at and just, God, having all this bullshit happen to me around Christmas, what is it about the fucking holidays and what is it about winter time that just makes the shit hit the fan?
8380124	8380504	I hate it.
8380984	8384105	So 2005 can go on and get the fuck out of here because we need a new year.
8384245	8390946	I need a clean slate and I need time to get all my errands done so I don't have to work all freaking day.
8390986	8391566	It's getting old.
8391947	8392207	Alright.
8393347	8393567	Anyway.
8394605	8395025	That's that.
8395306	8396847	Let's go to the chatroom FU, shall we?
8396887	8398968	Let's see what our chatroom angst is tonight.
8401550	8410937	Ron Chan would like to say FU to my job for keeping me late tonight for work and an FU to me for not taking my TV to the shop sooner since now I have no TV here.
8413919	8418861	NintendoManiac64 says, F you to more Mario Kart DS Disconnectors.
8419461	8423502	F you to a deer hitting our van and taking out half of its grill and killing the left light.
8423942	8426603	F you to Sony, die already like your products do.
8427583	8429904	DarkTetsuya says, F you to Ultramix 3 again.
8429984	8432165	First Rainbow Flyer, now Gamma and the couple?
8432525	8435046	When will PlayStation 2 fans finally get to love?
8436280	8441144	Sakurina says, F you to requesting Sabrina from Pops.
8441544	8442885	I don't know if I have it, dude.
8443466	8444146	Maybe somewhere.
8444807	8447028	And F you to being nervous and not approaching girls.
8447389	8448149	Final F you.
8448229	8449810	Fuck you, almighty snow god.
8451011	8452993	Get snow while Oregon does.
8453033	8453653	What the fuck?
8453934	8456816	You make me want to listen to Rizlem remix, you pitiful being.
8458803	8465228	ProPanda21 says, F you to crappy heavy metal, crap, and to panda burritos, not polluting the world with their goodness.
8465748	8465968	What?
8466449	8469791	And F you to my rainbow queen of the cosmos strap-on for being broken.
8472313	8477277	Xander C says, F you to, uh, well, nothing, I'm happy tonight, very happy.
8477577	8479038	Oh, I know, F you to unhappy people.
8480179	8482641	Roz says, F you to my brother for sitting on my right arm.
8482921	8485343	It hurts to move and I suck at using my left arm and hand.
8487110	8510030	DarkKnight says, my FU goes to my car for crushing my cell phone screen, now I know what to get myself for Christmas Saturday, and an FU to my job for opening at 7am this morning, know damn well that no one shops that fucking early on a Sunday, I may have to to get my Christmas shopping done, I don't know, AZM Buddy Paul says, FU to final exams, and FU to my dependence on sleep,
8512225	8514507	and some FUs coming from Sharks Girl.
8514988	8523455	FU to miles 12 to 22 of the marathon because hot damn, not only was it hard, but they friggin' ran out of ice in Hawaii.
8523476	8527659	80 degrees and 10 miles is bad with no ice, but damn it, I did it.
8529241	8532204	And that was our last FU tonight.
8532664	8535827	And congratulations to Sharks Girl, by the way, for running that marathon there.
8536227	8536988	That's some good stuff.
8539281	8545603	That's a long way to... I mean, God, I've done the 6 mile marathon and I thought that was bad, but 22, that's... Oh, shit, that's a lot.
8546303	8552924	NintendoManiac64 also wants to add F you to Rainbow, I'm thinking Rainbow Road, in Mario Kart DS.
8553324	8555505	Seriously, the first 10 seconds decide the entire race.
8556205	8557305	That's it, no more F yous, none.
8557866	8558746	You're done, you're cut off.
8559126	8559446	All of you.
8561266	8563067	I want nothing but happiness from here on out.
8564436	8567926	Except for the break, which will be emo, which I'm very excited about.
8571738	8573619	So we're getting down to the wire here.
8573659	8574599	It's almost the end of the year.
8574639	8579441	You know, the next time we do a live show is going to be 2006, I think, because we're not going to be here next week live.
8579801	8581862	I think we're going to have a tape thingy-ma-bobber going on.
8582142	8583042	What is it?
8583082	8584923	DarkSakura's F'd Up Christmas?
8584963	8586104	Or what were we going to do next week?
8586124	8586584	I don't remember.
8586604	8589605	We were going to pre-tape some fucking stuff.
8589625	8595847	Yeah, we need to do... I think we should do the most fucked up Christmas songs we can find.
8596207	8597288	And like Christmas Speed.
8598644	8601927	Oh, fuck Christmas Speed, seriously, I fucking hate that CD.
8602067	8603188	Good, we should play it.
8603409	8607172	Alright, so we'll do the Orange Lingerie O'Merry fucking Christmas special.
8607392	8607993	Yeah.
8609034	8610195	Well, I've got to look forward to it.
8610515	8611716	And then that, what, New Year's?
8611756	8613238	And we're going to be here on New Year's Day, right?
8613258	8614199	We'll be back on New Year's Day.
8614219	8616741	Because nobody does anything on, like, New Year's Day.
8617502	8620024	Unless I'm, like, still drunk.
8620144	8623688	Well, let's see, here's the thing, is that New Year's Day, guess what?
8624770	8626291	Loki has that Monday off work.
8626772	8628073	I have that Monday off work.
8628873	8629714	You know what this means.
8629754	8630535	We're going to kick off 2006.
8632276	8635018	And would that be 169 or that would be 168?
8635338	8636999	Well, you know what we could do.
8638060	8640722	Well, I don't know that I should be making this suggestion on the air.
8640782	8641863	Try me.
8642203	8642624	Who cares?
8642704	8643004	Who cares?
8643164	8646647	Well, I'm sure you both are invited to Julie's thing at her condo.
8647908	8649669	But I was thinking I can bring my laptop.
8650009	8652611	We might be able to record a little something-something when the new year comes up.
8652752	8653452	That's a good thought.
8653472	8654513	Because I'm making apple pie.
8656386	8657628	Now I want to try some of that apple pie.
8657648	8658209	That sounds good.
8658529	8662295	You know, I heard if you drink a whole thing of cop syrup that you'll hallucinate.
8663214	8664935	We'll do something fun for the New Year's Day show.
8664955	8665255	That'll be fun.
8665515	8666015	More drinking.
8666035	8669677	You know, DDR Freak is not doing their top DDR songs of the year or whatever, so maybe we'll have to pick up the slack.
8669697	8670618	I need to talk to Iggy.
8687506	8693070	and see if we can steal that from DDR Freak since they're apparently not doing one this year because they would have done it by now, right?
8693370	8695451	Because that thing, that poll ran like what, all of December?
8696972	8697673	I'm going to have to talk.
8697953	8699614	She's still doing the radio station.
8699954	8701035	That's public news now.
8701055	8701595	They posted that.
8701615	8706278	We know she's not the forum's goddess anymore but she's still doing their radio, right?
8706298	8706979	We'll talk to Iggy.
8707319	8709741	We'll invite Iggy over to get drunk with us.
8709881	8710281	Why not?
8710301	8710701	That would be fun.
8710721	8711482	That would be a good time.
8711782	8712503	We'll all get drunk.
8713563	8714364	Be good times.
8715748	8716069	All right.
8717594	8718196	Let's see.
8718557	8720925	Episode 200 of Orange Launch Radio shows up next year.
8722291	8723311	That's going to be crazy.
8724032	8726474	Man, we've been doing this for a while.
8726494	8729616	Well, you know what's interesting is, you know what else this kind of marks three years?
8729757	8732299	Actually, it'll be one more week, but in this next week.
8732339	8733880	What, Christmas Eve is this next week, right?
8734440	8739965	This marks three years, three years since DDR Extreme came out in arcades.
8740885	8746130	That mix is officially three years old now, and basically three years since DDR essentially died in the arcades.
8747944	8748805	I know it's sad.
8748845	8750006	I mean, they've had a good life at home.
8750046	8756631	But In the Groove is out, and whether you love it or hate it, it's trying to pick up the slack that DDR kind of left behind in the arcades.
8756652	8758273	And then the home mix is a whole other story.
8758293	8759274	Tommy needs to step it up.
8760452	8760832	I don't know.
8760952	8761392	We'll see.
8761492	8764773	I mean, maybe this will be the year, but of course we said that last year.
8765013	8766153	Yeah, and what happened?
8766353	8766513	No.
8766833	8767514	Nah, nada.
8767674	8770354	Although they did have some good home mixes this year.
8770594	8772715	Yeah, I have to say they've been giving us love with the home mixes.
8772755	8773895	Extreme 2 was good.
8774195	8776016	Ultramix 3 was a little... could have been better.
8776236	8780277	Some of us were more arcade players than we were home players.
8780297	8781437	The problem with...
8782233	8791320	What's going on is that, you know, and this is, to Endegroove's credit, whether you love it or hate it, what it's trying to do is it's trying to keep that arcade scene going.
8791360	8795223	And that is how, I mean, let's face it, that is how we all met, the three of us here that do this show.
8795563	8805171	We met around a DDR machine, because it used to be the kind of thing that would attract people to come together and play and have a good time together, and we'd all meet at the arcade at a certain night.
8805211	8808673	We'd have a, what do we call it, Bombani night or DDR night, I don't remember what we called it.
8808693	8811716	We used to do Wednesdays over at Roosevelt Golf Land,
8812236	8814157	and, you know, doing the arcade thing.
8814497	8817438	And that's kind of how we all met, but now that's kind of gone.
8818798	8823560	Although some arcades have enough of an In the Groove community where that has kind of picked up the slack.
8824120	8829802	And I don't know, I never really got into In the Groove, but maybe that's because, maybe that's not necessarily In the Groove's fault.
8829822	8830862	This is something I was thinking about.
8830902	8832623	Maybe it's not necessarily In the Groove's fault.
8833203	8833724	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
8854172	8854452	DarkSakura.com
8883379	8889444	Um, let's start it off with, I think this song is pretty fucking depressing, so we're going to start off with a little bit of Silhouette of My Mind.
8889544	8890624	This is definitely an emo song.
8891205	8895688	So we'll be back with more, so since we did a happy break, we're going to do the depressing as fuck break, and then we'll be back.
8896248	8898230	So enjoy this, and we'll be back with more Orange Lounge Radio.
8898250	8905795	Orange Lounge Radio

9123193	9127140	I'm ready now, will I fall down if it all becomes too late?

9322657	9324777	No!
9324897	9325557	Just kidding.
9325998	9327038	Orange Lounge Radio.
9327098	9328718	Crap-free Vivani Radio.
9330519	9331579	Welcome back, boys and girls.
9331879	9335380	I hope you enjoyed that break of sadness and tragicness.
9336140	9337120	Deutz de Fatima.
9337860	9340441	Ghosts, I am gothic and silhouette of my mind.
9340461	9341901	That was a pretty emotional break.
9341961	9345422	I think I had a movement in my bowels during that break.
9348442	9354824	We're going to do a little bit of Ask Orange Lounge, but first, actually, we're going to go to our Skype line and open it up one more time there.
9355625	9360967	It's www.orangeloungeradio.com and click on Interact With Us if you wish to call the show.
9361387	9362887	And oh, look, we're already getting a call.
9363668	9364928	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
9365588	9366709	Hey, hey, hey, it's Ron Chan.
9367029	9368429	Hello, Ron Chan.
9368469	9369350	How are you, my friend?
9369950	9370470	I'm good.
9370530	9371390	How are you guys?
9371650	9371991	Good.
9372031	9372571	What's on your mind?
9373396	9375497	I have a couple of things I want to talk about real quick.
9375817	9380238	First, I played Flow to Urban Dance Groove.
9380498	9382638	Can you get yourself a little closer to your mic, buddy?
9382658	9383659	We're having a hard time hearing you.
9384159	9386039	But you got to play Flow?
9386779	9388040	Yeah, to Urban Dance Groove.
9388120	9388520	Much better.
9388580	9389300	Okay, how was that?
9391060	9393601	It's Def Jam meets Dance Dance Revolution.
9394061	9395221	Is this a good thing or a bad thing?
9396102	9396662	I don't know.
9397222	9400823	At first I felt kind of offended it was so bad, but yet it was just so funny.
9402321	9403541	What kind of songs are in this game?
9404682	9410864	There's a lot of old school stuff like this, and there's a lot of new school stuff I've never even heard of.
9412384	9412984	That's cool.
9414065	9414825	How is the interface?
9414885	9417466	How's the design of the game?
9417546	9418206	Does it flow?
9420546	9421547	Pretty much it does.
9421627	9423687	The dance steps are a little bit too easy, though.
9424788	9425128	Really?
9425208	9426708	No really hard mode or anything?
9428749	9431990	I think the levels are like DDR Mario Mix.
9432955	9434136	Ooh, that's no good.
9434316	9443259	Well, okay, but I guess if you're new to dance games, which maybe they're thinking the target audience for Flow is or is not the same group that plays DDR or whatever, I don't know.
9445460	9447341	Maybe that's just a warm-up.
9447421	9447741	I don't know.
9447801	9449382	Maybe... I don't know.
9449422	9449682	Who knows?
9450122	9459606	I don't even know what Ubiisoft is thinking because I remember one day I'm coming home and I see flyers for 187 Ride or Die and that game was really horrible.
9462165	9462986	Thank you for watching!
9479762	9480103	Wow.
9480543	9481945	Okay.
9482025	9485949	Actually, a lot of black people play video games.
9485989	9494399	At least when I watched the video game awards on Spike TV, I would have thought only black people play video games for the parts I watched.
9494479	9494739	I don't know.
9494759	9495500	It was just me.
9496121	9499604	I tell you this, when I play DDR, I know I don't feel alone when I play.
9503087	9503788	Anyway, okay.
9504288	9505249	Ray, stuff aside.
9505549	9508131	How does flow stack up?
9508191	9511614	I mean, is it a worthy purchase for the music game fan, or is it a piece of crap?
9512955	9514116	Wait till it drops to 19.
9514896	9516197	Wait till it drops to 19?
9516278	9518599	Is that with... Oh, no, because it's for PlayStation, right?
9519060	9519300	Yeah.
9519560	9521281	Okay, so that you can get the pads separately.
9521342	9521562	Okay.
9521942	9522683	Wait for it to drop to 19.
9523483	9524604	Dark Knight has a question.
9524884	9526446	Can you crunk in the game?
9527266	9529348	Only when you buy a 40-ounce to go with it.
9532057	9532378	Nice.
9533279	9535602	Alright, anything else going on in the world around him?
9536483	9537304	Uh, a couple of things.
9537605	9544253	To answer Loki's question, I've actually seen people drink a full bottle of cork syrup and get crazy at the raves.
9545455	9546136	Did you hear that, Loki?
9547310	9550551	He's seen people drink the bottle of cough syrup and get crazy at the raves.
9550811	9551271	Just so you know.
9551411	9554072	In response to... Listen to Red with Tess and MC Chris.
9556852	9559213	And, um... This one is for you, Jamie.
9559933	9567315	I was... I was coming home off of work tonight and this kid was asking his mom about getting GTA.
9567995	9570296	And she's like, no, you can't get it because it's...
9570896	9572257	You're too young for it.
9572437	9573058	End of story.
9573678	9577041	So he starts getting all mad and she's like, I'm gonna ask my father to get it.
9577061	9580464	She's like, well, you do that, you're still not gonna get it, so I'm gonna tell him not to.
9581024	9581965	And then he goes, you know what?
9582265	9583806	Fuck you, I'm gonna get it anyway.
9585608	9587329	The next part was priceless.
9588370	9591412	She grabbed him by his baggy pants like, you wanna say fuck you?
9591452	9595555	You wanna say fuck... She proceeded to beat his ass.
9595896	9596897	That is beautiful.
9597924	9598764	and many more.
9618479	9619940	Big Mama, that's all you need to know.
9644186	9644686	Let's see.
9645367	9653310	She has donated a Crucian carp to Blathers, and Blathers says, When I hear Crucian carp, I think to myself, taco.
9653791	9655231	Indeed, fish taco.
9655311	9655852	What, what?
9659073	9660034	That just cracked me up.
9660214	9660674	Taco!
9660894	9662735	You can see where this show is gone.
9663435	9665916	Half our show is being done in Animal Crossing tonight, actually.
9666497	9668338	Now you got me thinking of YTMND.
9669318	9672019	You know, we should take a picture of that or something and get it on YTMND.
9672039	9673300	I hate those things.
9675441	9678022	What is some good stuff on YTMND this week?
9678042	9679903	Because I don't follow YTMND, but I know you do.
9679943	9681964	What's some good stuff on GearTheManNow, dawg?
9682645	9684646	The Foreign DuckTales Translations.
9685126	9687067	Foreign DuckTales Translations.
9687467	9690588	Yeah, there's one where it sounds like they're saying Taco Nazi.
9694150	9695471	Only on the internet, boys and girls.
9695531	9696211	Only on the internet.
9696741	9698222	I did see something fun on the internet.
9698302	9698522	What?
9698602	9700723	That Garrett posted.
9701403	9701883	What was that?
9701943	9704844	I didn't end up watching it.
9704864	9706825	The how to eat sushi like a snooty bitch.
9707265	9708226	Does it have talking in it?
9708286	9709126	Can we play it on the show?
9709546	9710507	But it's all in Japanese.
9710807	9711307	Well, that's alright.
9711347	9711907	It might be funny.
9712407	9712728	We'll see.
9713448	9715209	Okay, it's linked on my live journal.
9715309	9715689	Oh, we'll see.
9716309	9718070	Alright, well, anything else you want to say to our listeners, Ron Chen?
9718945	9720886	One more thing about what's going on on the internet.
9721046	9723568	I found something called Genghis Khan.
9723968	9726249	It's a German pop band.
9726649	9727870	They're doing this song and dance.
9727930	9729091	It's just so funny.
9729291	9729871	It's crazy.
9729931	9731412	I'm going to post a couple of links to it.
9731452	9732132	Yeah, check it out.
9732513	9734874	It's not Genghis Khan!
9735174	9735694	It's not that?
9736435	9739196	It's a German pop group called Genghis Khan.
9739236	9740637	It's a German word for Genghis.
9741378	9742318	Oh, okay.
9742718	9743079	Interesting.
9743619	9743979	Yeah.
9744419	9744700	All right.
9744980	9747181	Well, link us in the chat room, all right?
9747622	9748202	That I will.
9748362	9748542	Alright.
9748603	9749483	OrangeLoungeRadio.com.
9749503	9749963	Click on chat.
9750323	9750624	Alright.
9751744	9752545	Have a good one, my friend.
9752565	9753325	Thank you for calling in.
9753705	9754145	You too.
9754446	9754746	Alright.
9755166	9755786	Bye.
9757367	9757747	Alright.
9758267	9758748	That was fun.
9759668	9760509	Our good buddy, Ron Chan.
9760529	9762290	We're going to get into Ask Orange Lounge in a little bit.
9762630	9767592	But first, I'm going to log into LiveJournal so I can get that link here that DarkSakura posted there in her blog.
9768573	9773575	Now, what... I've got to bring it up here, though, so that I can get the audio out.
9773635	9776557	Now, tell us again what this thing is all about here that we're going to watch.
9777389	9786498	The proper way to eat sushi, even directions as to how you enter the place, to how you pour your beer for people.
9787098	9790942	And really, a lot of that is just polite custom, but it's really overblowing it.
9792023	9792743	It's really funny.
9792844	9795866	It totally makes fun of a lot of things that people do at sushi restaurants.
9796267	9798729	Now, it's not super long, is it?
9800711	9801091	We'll see.
9801532	9801732	Okay.
9802503	9815335	We'll let it kind of start here, and if it's too long, then we'll just kind of... Might have to translate.
9815476	9817518	The snack most commonly associated with Japan.
9818759	9821782	A shop that sells sushi is called a sushi-ya.
9822542	9824945	Most Japanese eat at one every day.
9828428	9830095	This is the entrance to a Sushiya.
9830938	9833046	To pass through the short curtain called Noren,
9833971	9840677	From the lower left corner of the third partition, find the spot 3.2 inches up at an angle of 48 degrees.
9841077	9842719	Place your hand like this and peel open.
9844280	9849365	If you arrive less than 30 minutes before closing, ask, are you still open?
9849505	9851647	On entering the premises, inside,
9859464	9859844	2 people.
9860665	9861926	This is the number in your group.
9862506	9863607	In a group of 3, say.
9863627	9865549	3 people.
9866449	9867370	In a group of 4, say.
9867690	9868691	Okay, this is getting boring.
9868731	9869892	When does this get good?
9870332	9871593	It's just the whole thing is silly.
9872053	9875676	You should always show a little guilt in your eyes if you're alone.
9876520	9878022	Why would you be guilty if you're alone?
9878042	9879304	What if you're on business or something?
9880805	9886011	You know, we actually, we used to have a place here locally called Sushiya, so I think that's kind of funny.
9886171	9888074	I know, I'm sad that Sushiya is closed.
9888294	9891097	These two men look like they're going to get it on.
9893940	9894760	No.
9894780	9895661	They were hella flirting.
9895821	9896441	Did you see that?
9896501	9897322	Is this seat taken?
9897522	9901764	I'll post it in the chat room.
9901904	9904405	Yeah, post the link in the chat room.
9904425	9904965	It's hilarious.
9905326	9905606	Alright.
9906866	9907407	That'll be fun.
9914590	9916591	Where did those faces come from?
9917912	9920193	Blanca in Animal Crossing there.
9920333	9921713	Is OLR Town still open?
9921753	9922954	I did a zombie face on her.
9924654	9928375	OLR Town is currently closed at the moment, but I can open it back up.
9928395	9928995	Open it back up.
9929435	9929875	Hold on.
9934937	9935197	Okay.
9936097	9939158	Let's go to some Ask Orange Lounge, boys and girls, because we promised it.
9945973	9948894	Let's Ask Orange Lounge some stupid question.
9949415	9952676	What will we find out this week on Orange Lounge Radio?
9953316	9960019	Will we find out the best of 2005 or is the best yet to come in the next two weeks?
9969804	9974746	Nintendo Maniac 64 says, Hey Loki, what do you think about gay sex?
9978803	9981144	Now that's one of the best jokes of 2005 right there.
9981204	9982925	One of the best Orange Lounge Radio jokes of 2005.
9983065	9986247	You don't have a response to that, Loki?
9988848	9991290	Um, gay sex, that's sex and gay.
9992770	9995452	Hey, Loki, what do you think about gay sex?
9995812	9996793	Oh, it's so much fun.
9998834	9999314	There you have it.
10002613	10004534	Sky, what do you think about Big Dick?
10005475	10007096	What the fuck kind of question is that?
10007996	10009778	It's size is relative, people.
10010478	10010898	Doesn't matter.
10010939	10012360	It's not the size, it's how you use it.
10014801	10020325	When you hear my name, well, username, Nintendomaniac64, what about me do you think of?
10021526	10022667	The fact that you like Nintendo?
10022727	10023427	I mean, I... The toilet.
10024148	10024728	The toilet.
10028962	10032843	I think about all that fucking snaking that you do in Mario Kart DS.
10033723	10035624	What language is the best other than English?
10035684	10036304	I like this question.
10036324	10037804	What language is the best other than English?
10038585	10039085	Swahili.
10040125	10040425	Loki?
10042566	10043706	What's the best language?
10043766	10044426	Other than English?
10044486	10044906	Finnish.
10044946	10045926	Other than English?
10049487	10049968	Swedish.
10051168	10052148	I would say Pig Latin.
10054769	10055189	Yeah, it would be.
10057482	10063744	Uh, VXJasonXV, our faithful webmaster, says, Dear Orange Launch Radio, would you like a new website?
10064284	10064644	Yes!
10064804	10065925	OMG, yes, please.
10067005	10069306	As long as we can update the news easy on the new one, yes.
10069806	10074387	I actually, I want to talk to you offline about that, Jason, because of something later.
10074527	10075788	I am going to say something on record.
10076088	10076288	Yes.
10076608	10078269	I am taking Flash next semester.
10079589	10080069	Scare.
10083050	10084450	She's going to make her own YTMNDs.
10084610	10085591	I'm very excited about that.
10086576	10087476	No, I'm not.
10087556	10089257	I'm going to make something special.
10090197	10093619	Rene would like to know, is Akira Yamaoka gay?
10093639	10097340	I hope not, because he's going to be my next husband.
10097400	10098760	I saw this on some web form.
10098780	10100441	They were seriously debating if he was gay or not.
10101441	10111485	I could swear that there's some interview out there, and Rice Princess pointed this out to me, where he said that the first song he wrote, or one of the songs he wrote on piano, was about some girl.
10112245	10113226	So I don't think he's gay.
10113266	10116047	And when I, you know, I am gay, so I have gaydar.
10116327	10119589	When I met him, because I actually met him at E3 a couple years ago, he didn't strike me as gay.
10119829	10121410	So, does it really matter, though?
10121470	10122411	He struck me as hot.
10122691	10124452	Does it really matter if he's gay?
10124612	10126253	Although the shirt he wore was kind of gay.
10126633	10127214	I mean, that was gay.
10127514	10128815	But that's okay.
10129155	10130476	I don't really care if he's gay or not.
10130556	10131716	He can make good music.
10132037	10134678	But I know that's a big controversial thing on the internet right now.
10134738	10135218	Who cares?
10139716	10142198	What is the... Oh, maybe that's why we got rid of this microphone.
10142219	10143119	This is the buzzing microphone.
10143139	10143380	We'll see.
10143960	10147724	And what is the ultimate Bomani song when listened to in moderation?
10147824	10149686	Ooh, the ultimate Bomani song.
10150707	10151147	What do you think?
10151367	10152448	The ultimate Bomani song.
10152589	10153169	DarkSakura.
10155932	10157073	My butt, the ass mix.
10157834	10158294	Stop.
10159495	10159856	I don't know.
10160997	10161217	Loki?
10164362	10170747	Um, I still like, um, what was it, um, moving on.
10174229	10186198	I have a real fond place for drifting away, but I also love, love, love, and this doesn't even have to be in moderation, I could just listen to this on repeat all day long, Skulk, from Ultimix 2, I just, I absolutely love that song.
10187459	10187699	Love it!
10191951	10196254	Sakurina wants to know how does one know if he or she has an STD?
10196334	10198115	More precisely, how do you get it checked?
10199860	10201761	How does one know if he or she has an STD?
10202121	10203542	Well, there are signs.
10204603	10208845	There's lots and lots of different types of STDs, so the best way to find out really is to get tested.
10209265	10215027	Get tested for STDs, and that's how you're going to know, because the doctor can shove something in your pee hole and find out that way.
10216108	10218849	Or, you know, there's tests you can do, blood tests and things.
10218909	10220570	It just depends what STD you're looking for.
10220590	10227413	I mean, crabs, well, if your pubes itch a lot and there's little things bouncing, no, not really, you can't always see it, you probably have crabs.
10228897	10231157	If something's wrong, go to the doctor.
10231277	10233398	If you're itchy, use a cream.
10233798	10243660	You can look up symptoms on a site like WebMD, or I can tell you from my background, I work for an insurance company, a lot of insurance companies have, well, wait, you're Canadian though, so I don't know what to tell you.
10243940	10248181	Never mind, I forgot he's Canadian, so it's an entirely different ballgame.
10248741	10254142	I don't know if they have advice nurses, something like that in Canada, but if they have something like that, check it out.
10255302	10257203	They can call on the phone, because they have that here.
10257283	10258184	Insurance companies have that.
10258404	10260165	Anything else you want to add, Loki?
10260906	10278538	I just want to add that I drew a penis on Blanka's face, and this will be going to some random user's DS out there, and I'm glad that a little kid's going to see a penis on Blanka's face, and it's going to have my credit to it.
10278618	10278958	Good job.
10280143	10282764	Xander C wants to know, why aren't more people happy?
10283364	10285944	I'm happy, so should everyone else be happy.
10286405	10290886	But if they think about geometry, they should want to kill people, like me, because I am the cool, right?
10292266	10293586	Dude, what drugs are you on, seriously?
10296287	10297287	No, I don't know.
10298127	10299548	What kind of things make you happy?
10300148	10300968	That's what I want to know.
10301568	10302668	I'm changing this question a little bit.
10302708	10303629	What makes you happy?
10303729	10304669	Loki, what makes you happy?
10308544	10311284	Um, pleasure makes me happy.
10311304	10311805	Like what?
10311845	10312705	Pleasure makes you happy?
10312985	10314326	Any pleasure makes me happy.
10314826	10315106	Okay.
10315706	10317006	DarkSakura, what makes you happy?
10319567	10321688	Um, a day off of work.
10322768	10324089	I'm surprised you didn't say fire.
10324689	10327350	Well, I like fire, but I can get that anytime I want it.
10327590	10328450	You know, it's like sex.
10329351	10332132	So, but I can't always get a day off of work when I want it.
10332692	10334952	So, a day off of work, just to do whatever I want to.
10335293	10336133	You know what makes me happy?
10337245	10337465	Abba.
10338646	10339526	Abba makes me happy.
10341186	10342447	Abba makes everybody happy.
10342467	10349349	You cannot help but be happy listening to Abba.
10349409	10350430	Oh, I'm sorry.
10353991	10354451	Moving on.
10355892	10356052	What?
10356072	10356872	I know what makes me happy.
10357472	10357732	Bear.
10359153	10359773	By the gorillas?
10359953	10360153	Yeah.
10361505	10362406	or Truth or Dare.
10362446	10364887	Truth or Dare can make me happy when things go my way.
10365387	10367969	I play Truth or Dare.
10368709	10373452	Now with my new stereo, that song sounds completely fabulous in my car and I get really hyper and drive fast.
10374633	10375674	My car makes me happy too.
10377275	10379116	Alright, NeoDudeZero.
10379496	10382158	Hey, did you hear about all the new games in development for the DS?
10382398	10386800	One will raise your IQ as you play it and the other teaches little girls how to orgasm.
10387881	10389382	That one's not coming out as conceptual.
10390188	10390789	What's this, Loki?
10391089	10391309	Mike?
10391509	10394192	So the game is not coming out, it's just a conceptual game.
10394552	10395913	Where's this all from?
10395973	10396934	Is this like a website or something?
10396954	10405381	It's this little game you play with like a rabbit, and it supposedly teaches you the way to rub out orgasms, you make the rabbit happy.
10406302	10411487	So it's like Masturbation Technique 101 or something, the game.
10414682	10417323	Illusion asks a question that simply says, vagina.
10418024	10419644	I'm sorry, not vagina.
10419684	10420224	It's not a statement.
10420264	10421345	It's vagina?
10425867	10427628	Chup, chup, chup, chup, chup.
10429829	10433490	Tasty.
10437712	10437952	What?
10438052	10439133	I don't know what you want me to say.
10441718	10444440	Thank you for bringing us to Crashing a Hulk!
10444500	10444900	Good job.
10444960	10445761	You broke our show.
10445821	10446181	Good job.
10446602	10450104	So, uh, since you broke our show, here's some, uh, more ABBA to make us happy again.
10453067	10454528	This show has just gotten weird.
10457430	10458170	More ABBA.
10458190	10459351	No, we need more cowbells.
10460372	10461253	Play Don't Fear the Reaper.
10469742	10479307	You can dance, you can jive Having the time of your life Okay, this show's gotten too gay.
10479968	10480188	Sorry.
10482589	10482929	Too gay.
10485711	10489393	Nintendo Maniac64 says, Can I erase someone in Mario Kart DS?
10489493	10493635	I won't even snake, but I will powerslide insanely on turns, so fear.
10494916	10495016	Um...
10497697	10503704	I have a copy of Mario Kart DS in the other room, but I'm too busy playing Final Fantasy Advance 4.
10503744	10508749	If I'm going to turn that fucking thing on, I'm beating Final Fantasy Advance 4, because I haven't beaten a video game in forever.
10509330	10511091	I love Final Fantasy 4, too.
10511152	10511892	It's so great.
10512413	10512893	So great.
10514615	10515977	But ask our chat room.
10517117	10519819	I actually did one specifically just for friend codes in all of the available games.
10519859	10526083	Because we had one for Mario Kart DS, but since more and more games are going to come out that have friend code adding ability, I thought I'd just put it up there.
10541786	10542106	Good deal.
10542707	10548970	But be sure in that thread you say who you're adding because in a lot of these games you have to have both people on the list.
10549611	10550831	So make sure you say who you're adding.
10551672	10555574	Oh yeah, there's those other websites too.
10555994	10561457	DSMeet, and I want to say one of our listeners, BigRedPimp, had another one that's a popular DSMeeting site.
10561497	10563759	But you know, stick to the Orange Lounge cult.
10564839	10565540	Stick to our forums.
10568081	10570803	Illusion had another question and the question was Waterloo?
10579184	10580225	I could do this all night, you guys.
10580405	10581206	I could do it all night long.
10582788	10586652	AZM Buddy Paul wants to know, Skye, are you the dancing queen?
10586912	10589635	Actually, I'm a terrible dancer, actually.
10590235	10593138	No, no, no, this is great, because Rob Hat does the choo-choo dance.
10594179	10596502	That's the only way I can describe it.
10597102	10602007	Actually, I think it was Eddie or somebody used to label me as, I would roll down the window when I dance.
10602788	10604948	When I play DDR, I'm always rolling down the window.
10605168	10606089	The choo-choo dance.
10607389	10611410	I had never really seen you do the choo-choo dance until we went to Asylum.
10612530	10617131	Now, keep in mind, this is the goth night at one of our local clubs.
10617911	10620311	And they played Girls and Boys.
10621552	10622992	I had to go back in there because it was blur.
10623492	10625332	And Rob gets out there and does the choo-choo dance.
10625352	10627533	And I'm sitting there just watching Rob, and I'm drunk off my ass.
10628735	10631277	Singing along while Rob's doing the choo-choo dance.
10631337	10631717	It's funny.
10631897	10639303	It's not so much the choo-choo dance as it is the white people dance.
10639583	10641965	You know, somebody needs to teach me how to dance.
10641985	10645768	See, I need to befriend... Is this a movie somewhere, maybe?
10645868	10651192	I need to befriend a black person with rhythm to teach me how to dance.
10651813	10653854	And, like, I enter a competition and win a lot of money.
10655376	10656436	Is that White Man Can't Jump?
10657097	10657397	I don't know.
10658298	10658418	No.
10660222	10667770	The only thing I remember about that movie is what's her name who decided that she was going to be on Jeopardy.
10669232	10670593	That's the only thing about that movie I remember.
10672916	10674738	I don't remember any of that.
10677761	10678782	I actually never saw that movie.
10679783	10680884	Something I should probably share there.
10680904	10682166	I never even saw that movie.
10683929	10697676	Some folks in the chat room are getting a little angsty because we're playing so much ABBA, and they want to hear some disco prints from We Heart Katamari, I don't know, maybe like as alternate disco, so... That's all you get.
10699177	10707241	That reminds me, me and Mike Katamari comes out to the BSP this week for the Japanese, which means I'll have it.
10707401	10708162	Really, this week?
10708702	10709202	Yeah, the 22nd.
10709242	10709903	Sweet!
10711823	10712424	That's awesome.
10713140	10714341	No more ABBA requests.
10714401	10717263	Stop ABBA... God damn, now I have all these requests for ABBA.
10717283	10723708	The secret of me and my Katamari is that all the music is going to be done by me and my... Doop-be-doop-be-doop-be-doop-doop-doop.
10724729	10726750	They didn't do... Yeah, they did, didn't they?
10726870	10727371	Yes, they did.
10727871	10730193	I have a really cool song that they did, though, that wasn't in DDR.
10730293	10731454	Maybe I'll put it in the cage match one day.
10732314	10732975	If I haven't already.
10733996	10736217	Wasn't that... Were they the ones that did Lion Eddie?
10736257	10737078	No, no, that's Smile Decay.
10737118	10737818	No, they did Takeru...
10740709	10741632	Oh yeah, I like that song.
10741652	10742113	That was pretty.
10742454	10743698	Good times, good times.
10744175	10746917	Thank you so much for tuning in and listening tonight.
10746957	10748538	And I'm glad we didn't get the plug pulled on us.
10748578	10748859	That's good.
10748879	10751180	That's always good news to not get the plug pulled on us.
10751220	10753042	Let's go around and get everybody's final thought.
10753062	10753902	Loki, your final thought tonight.
10772540	10775022	My final thought is I just found the money rock.
10776043	10776424	Good job.
10777464	10781448	My final thought is time.
10782369	10782769	Need more.
10783490	10784551	DarkSakura, your final thought.
10786452	10789175	Reject false icons and someone give me a cure for the plague.
10790751	10793773	Alright, that's going to do it for tonight's episode of Orange Lounge Radio.
10793813	10795895	The final word of the show, one word to sum it all up.
10796355	10801158	Next week, oh, next week we will not be live, but we will be doing something taped, so if you're around, tune in anyway.
10801839	10803020	And of course, stay tuned to the podcast.
10803040	10804761	We will have a new podcast one way or the other.
10804781	10806962	We have to figure out how we're going to tape that, but we'll do that one way or the other.
10807943	10809364	And that's that.
10809404	10813026	Then we'll see you back here on New Year's Day for the first Orange Lounge Radio of 2006, live.
10813807	10815168	And maybe some drinking going on.
10815208	10816409	We'll see what happens, if you're good.
10818361	10819682	We have a fun month ahead of us.
10820162	10820602	We sure do.
10821043	10822203	Alright, the final word of the show.
10822343	10823844	One word to sum it all up.
10824644	10825645	DarkSakura, what's it going to be?
10829346	10834229	That does it for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio Live.
