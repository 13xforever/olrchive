1
00:00:00,149 --> 00:00:01,370
[SPEAKER_03]: Hello everybody out there in podcasting land.

2
00:00:23,103 --> 00:00:24,584
[SPEAKER_03]: or whatever your hometown happens to be.

3
00:00:24,604 --> 00:00:26,845
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you think there's actually a town out there named Podcasting Land?

4
00:00:26,865 --> 00:00:27,206
[SPEAKER_03]: Probably not.

5
00:00:27,306 --> 00:00:29,427
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, there's Dish, Texas, so why not?

6
00:00:29,727 --> 00:00:30,007
[SPEAKER_03]: Why not?

7
00:00:30,728 --> 00:00:31,888
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd move to Podcasting Land.

8
00:00:32,669 --> 00:00:35,270
[SPEAKER_03]: You're listening to Orange Lounge Radio To Go.

9
00:00:35,511 --> 00:00:36,431
[SPEAKER_03]: My name is Rob Roberts.

10
00:00:36,451 --> 00:00:37,532
[SPEAKER_03]: You might know me as Sky.

11
00:00:38,112 --> 00:00:41,194
[SPEAKER_03]: Joining me as always, the one and only Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers.

12
00:00:41,594 --> 00:00:41,914
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi.

13
00:00:42,235 --> 00:00:42,555
[SPEAKER_03]: How are you?

14
00:00:43,937 --> 00:00:44,718
[SPEAKER_05]: I still have the plague.

15
00:00:45,178 --> 00:00:45,979
[SPEAKER_03]: But you sound better.

16
00:00:46,039 --> 00:00:48,642
[SPEAKER_03]: Have you had lots of liquid Vicodin and codeine and all that good stuff?

17
00:00:49,082 --> 00:00:50,644
[SPEAKER_05]: I drank codeine before the three hour show.

18
00:00:50,904 --> 00:00:51,204
[SPEAKER_03]: Awesome.

19
00:00:51,865 --> 00:00:54,968
[SPEAKER_05]: And I get to go home to sleep with Prince Vicodin.

20
00:00:55,788 --> 00:00:57,189
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

21
00:01:18,487 --> 00:01:24,137
[SPEAKER_03]: But sometimes we do have to talk about a couple games that do suck, or has been the trend lately, movies based on games that kind of suck.

22
00:01:24,738 --> 00:01:25,619
[SPEAKER_03]: Such as BloodRayne.

23
00:01:25,639 --> 00:01:26,621
[SPEAKER_03]: Seen the trailer for BloodRayne?

24
00:01:26,701 --> 00:01:27,522
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm actually going to see it.

25
00:01:27,983 --> 00:01:28,304
[SPEAKER_03]: Why?

26
00:01:28,644 --> 00:01:28,965
[SPEAKER_03]: Why?

27
00:01:29,045 --> 00:01:30,487
[SPEAKER_03]: That's like $10 wasted.

28
00:01:30,547 --> 00:01:31,950
[SPEAKER_04]: Because there's pretty men in it.

29
00:01:32,847 --> 00:01:34,968
[SPEAKER_01]: There's also pretty prostitutes that are naked.

30
00:01:35,788 --> 00:01:36,688
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm Candy!

31
00:01:36,828 --> 00:01:39,709
[SPEAKER_03]: You are both being vapid and superficial.

32
00:01:40,089 --> 00:01:48,212
[SPEAKER_01]: Listen, I have to watch Alone in the Dark and I also have to watch House of the Dead before I see BloodRayne because I have to understand what I'm getting myself into.

33
00:01:48,232 --> 00:01:50,833
[SPEAKER_03]: You have to complete the poop trilogy is what you have to do.

34
00:01:50,873 --> 00:01:51,874
[SPEAKER_05]: House of the Dead was funny.

35
00:01:52,354 --> 00:01:53,014
[SPEAKER_05]: And awful.

36
00:01:53,806 --> 00:01:54,366
[SPEAKER_01]: and what was it?

37
00:01:54,427 --> 00:02:00,491
[SPEAKER_01]: In the name of the king, a dungeon siege movie blows ass is what the trailer sucked.

38
00:02:01,091 --> 00:02:02,952
[SPEAKER_01]: Burt Reynolds looks really bored.

39
00:02:04,293 --> 00:02:04,873
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, anyway.

40
00:02:05,034 --> 00:02:06,014
[SPEAKER_05]: Probably weren't paying him enough.

41
00:02:06,294 --> 00:02:15,220
[SPEAKER_03]: Before we got into that topic, we're supposed to talk about what kind of games we've been playing this week because that's how we start off the show, a little bit of a personal touch because, damn, we're important.

42
00:02:15,661 --> 00:02:16,681
[SPEAKER_03]: Or at least we'd like to think we are.

43
00:02:16,721 --> 00:02:19,123
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, who is most important.

44
00:02:20,919 --> 00:02:21,960
[SPEAKER_03]: What have you been playing this week?

45
00:02:21,980 --> 00:02:24,262
[SPEAKER_05]: What kind of games have you been playing this week?

46
00:02:45,492 --> 00:02:46,513
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, like, that's hard.

47
00:02:48,194 --> 00:02:56,819
[SPEAKER_05]: I've been really not playing much of anything because I've had the plague again all week, which is fun, but in a not really sort of way.

48
00:02:57,359 --> 00:03:02,442
[SPEAKER_05]: However, for my husband's birthday, which was Tuesday, we got him an Xbox 360.

49
00:03:02,482 --> 00:03:02,722
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, right on.

50
00:03:05,184 --> 00:03:08,427
[SPEAKER_05]: We've had days filled with Perfect Dark Zero, which is gorgeous.

51
00:03:09,627 --> 00:03:11,969
[SPEAKER_05]: The new Ridge Racer is really, really nice.

52
00:03:13,930 --> 00:03:15,932
[SPEAKER_05]: He's also been really into Project Gotham.

53
00:03:18,073 --> 00:03:25,959
[SPEAKER_05]: Although for some reason he was playing Liberty City Grand Theft Auto on the PSP today.

54
00:03:25,979 --> 00:03:27,240
[SPEAKER_06]: I heard it's a decent game, you know.

55
00:03:28,541 --> 00:03:36,245
[SPEAKER_05]: Also, I got to see, actually, the new Madden game, which was nice, if you like Madden.

56
00:03:36,605 --> 00:03:39,486
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I'm not a big sports game fan, but the game looked pretty.

57
00:03:39,807 --> 00:03:40,227
[SPEAKER_03]: But you know what?

58
00:03:40,367 --> 00:03:43,028
[SPEAKER_03]: If I want to play football, give me some Tecmo Bowl.

59
00:03:43,689 --> 00:03:45,249
[SPEAKER_05]: The new NBA 2006?

60
00:03:45,309 --> 00:03:47,471
[SPEAKER_05]: That actually looks kind of fun.

61
00:03:49,004 --> 00:03:52,106
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, the most sports games I've enjoyed have been basketball.

62
00:03:52,166 --> 00:03:53,327
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, there's NBA Jam.

63
00:03:53,627 --> 00:03:54,988
[SPEAKER_03]: Loved NBA Jam back in the day.

64
00:03:55,008 --> 00:03:55,608
[SPEAKER_01]: Double Dribble.

65
00:03:55,628 --> 00:03:56,268
[SPEAKER_03]: NBA Jam was great.

66
00:03:57,009 --> 00:03:59,370
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, of course, these are all like 15-year-old games.

67
00:04:00,010 --> 00:04:02,051
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, NBA Jam was a good game.

68
00:04:02,412 --> 00:04:05,673
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks to EA, you can never have another NBA Jam.

69
00:04:05,793 --> 00:04:06,034
[SPEAKER_03]: Well...

70
00:04:06,934 --> 00:04:09,115
[SPEAKER_03]: They can go to hell.

71
00:04:09,335 --> 00:04:14,176
[SPEAKER_05]: But I do have to say that Mike Bibby did not look like himself in that game.

72
00:04:14,216 --> 00:04:16,196
[SPEAKER_05]: That was a very bad version of him.

73
00:04:16,657 --> 00:04:21,358
[SPEAKER_05]: However, Art Corvino looked very nice, because of course the first game Dan did was Lakers vs. Kings.

74
00:04:21,578 --> 00:04:23,498
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course, as most people in this area would do.

75
00:04:24,659 --> 00:04:24,999
[SPEAKER_05]: Whatever.

76
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:32,545
[SPEAKER_05]: I did play some more Katamari just because and of course it made me uber motion sick because I've been sick anyway.

77
00:04:34,427 --> 00:04:36,969
[SPEAKER_05]: I turned on World of Warcraft again and then promptly left the room.

78
00:04:38,550 --> 00:04:39,071
[SPEAKER_03]: Why is that?

79
00:04:39,891 --> 00:04:40,712
[SPEAKER_04]: I forgot about it.

80
00:04:40,772 --> 00:04:42,013
[SPEAKER_04]: I had to do something and I came back.

81
00:04:42,093 --> 00:04:43,094
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, World of Warcraft.

82
00:04:43,134 --> 00:04:43,835
[SPEAKER_03]: Something shiny.

83
00:04:44,938 --> 00:04:46,139
[SPEAKER_05]: That's my shiny thing.

84
00:04:47,139 --> 00:04:55,382
[SPEAKER_05]: And I just haven't had... You know, I've also had to go back to school and work and... Well, Animal Crossing this week.

85
00:04:55,402 --> 00:04:56,383
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you going to make some time for it?

86
00:04:56,403 --> 00:04:57,923
[SPEAKER_03]: I know you're doing Animal Crossing.

87
00:04:57,943 --> 00:04:58,223
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, hell yeah.

88
00:04:58,263 --> 00:05:00,564
[SPEAKER_05]: My breaks are no longer going to be spent on my book.

89
00:05:01,184 --> 00:05:02,825
[SPEAKER_05]: They're going to be spent on playing Animal Crossing.

90
00:05:02,845 --> 00:05:03,945
[SPEAKER_03]: There you go.

91
00:05:04,526 --> 00:05:07,487
[SPEAKER_03]: Me, you, bike racks, 3 o'clock, bring your bug net.

92
00:05:07,507 --> 00:05:08,387
[SPEAKER_03]: That's all I have to say.

93
00:05:08,847 --> 00:05:09,428
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, hell yeah.

94
00:05:09,648 --> 00:05:10,008
[SPEAKER_03]: It's on.

95
00:05:10,148 --> 00:05:12,329
[SPEAKER_05]: Just wait until I put some signs in your village.

96
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:16,422
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, Loki, what's on your mind?

97
00:05:17,462 --> 00:05:20,405
[SPEAKER_03]: As far as games goes, I don't care about what else is on your mind, I just want to know games.

98
00:05:20,605 --> 00:05:28,030
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I've been playing Grand Theft Auto Liberty City Stories, the usual by workday game that we play.

99
00:05:28,751 --> 00:05:31,513
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been kicking the crap out of everybody because I fucking rock.

100
00:05:32,253 --> 00:05:38,318
[SPEAKER_01]: And then also I've been playing Matrix Path of Neo, and that was pretty cool.

101
00:05:38,478 --> 00:05:39,519
[SPEAKER_01]: It's actually a lot...

102
00:05:40,194 --> 00:05:40,394
[SPEAKER_01]: and so on.

103
00:06:01,059 --> 00:06:11,083
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a pretty well done game, and I like how you can select your difficulty in the beginning, how it just gets progressively harder, and then you select it off of that.

104
00:06:12,383 --> 00:06:14,604
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't like the fact that the cameras are really slow.

105
00:06:15,024 --> 00:06:21,586
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, you change the camera around, it moves too slow, and I can't get it to go faster, and so I get a lot of awkward camera shots with that.

106
00:06:21,987 --> 00:06:23,927
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know, it's pretty good, and then it gets really hard.

107
00:06:24,768 --> 00:06:25,628
[SPEAKER_01]: Really hard, really fast.

108
00:06:25,648 --> 00:06:25,768
[SPEAKER_01]: Like,

109
00:06:26,203 --> 00:06:27,844
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I saw a story over on Dig or something about that game.

110
00:06:27,864 --> 00:06:28,864
[SPEAKER_01]: What's this all about?

111
00:06:28,904 --> 00:06:30,605
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a free game that's put out.

112
00:06:30,645 --> 00:06:32,446
[SPEAKER_01]: You can go to the website www.cloudthegame.com

113
00:06:55,820 --> 00:06:59,262
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's supposedly a game that's supposed to make you cry, I guess.

114
00:07:00,163 --> 00:07:01,744
[SPEAKER_01]: Wait, this game's going to make me cry?

115
00:07:01,924 --> 00:07:02,685
[SPEAKER_01]: Supposedly.

116
00:07:03,045 --> 00:07:03,325
[SPEAKER_01]: Why?

117
00:07:03,345 --> 00:07:10,069
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess because the content, I think it talks about some kids... Is it going to chop onions live in front of me?

118
00:07:10,289 --> 00:07:17,054
[SPEAKER_03]: Or is it going to show me hideous images from the things in our history and stuff?

119
00:07:17,094 --> 00:07:18,635
[SPEAKER_05]: Going to play Politary on repeat.

120
00:07:20,716 --> 00:07:21,317
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see here.

121
00:07:21,577 --> 00:07:25,119
[SPEAKER_01]: And actually, maybe it isn't cloudthegame.com, but I have the link right here.

122
00:07:26,092 --> 00:07:27,493
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a pretty fun game.

123
00:07:28,094 --> 00:07:31,276
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely worth checking it out, especially since it's a free download.

124
00:07:31,296 --> 00:07:32,536
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't really go wrong with that.

125
00:07:34,898 --> 00:07:38,540
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, it's actually thatcloudgame.com.

126
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:39,661
[SPEAKER_03]: Thatcloudgame.

127
00:07:40,341 --> 00:07:42,063
[SPEAKER_03]: Not to be confused with Final Fantasy VII Cloud.

128
00:07:42,343 --> 00:07:46,946
[SPEAKER_01]: It's created by the Game Innovation Group.

129
00:07:47,825 --> 00:07:56,658
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, students from Game Innovation who created, and it's a division of Interactive Media at University of Southern California School of Cinema and Television.

130
00:07:57,460 --> 00:07:58,601
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and it's actually...

131
00:07:59,571 --> 00:08:00,652
[SPEAKER_01]: Pretty awesome.

132
00:08:00,672 --> 00:08:03,654
[SPEAKER_01]: They've got a little FAQ here about it.

133
00:08:03,834 --> 00:08:05,795
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's just, it's a really well done game.

134
00:08:05,815 --> 00:08:06,275
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind of fun.

135
00:08:06,555 --> 00:08:09,857
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind of like Katamari and it's more of a puzzle game.

136
00:08:09,977 --> 00:08:11,478
[SPEAKER_03]: It's free and it's pretty.

137
00:08:11,518 --> 00:08:12,339
[SPEAKER_01]: What else do you need to know?

138
00:08:12,379 --> 00:08:13,200
[SPEAKER_01]: It's relaxing.

139
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:16,001
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not, there's not really any time limits or anything.

140
00:08:16,061 --> 00:08:25,187
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just kind of, you build clouds, you start off, you gather clouds and you can kind of suck them up and then you can kind of spit them back out again.

141
00:08:25,846 --> 00:08:30,810
[SPEAKER_01]: and create, like, taller clouds to pick up even bigger clouds and then you can make stuff rain and stuff like that.

142
00:08:30,830 --> 00:08:32,432
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, I'm still not driven to tears here.

143
00:08:33,272 --> 00:08:39,558
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I don't know what it is, but, um, it's just, it's a cool game, so thatcloudgame.com, go check it out.

144
00:08:39,578 --> 00:08:42,780
[SPEAKER_03]: If you have cried playing Cloud the Game, I seriously want to hear from you.

145
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:44,422
[SPEAKER_03]: 2go at orangelandradio.com.

146
00:08:44,482 --> 00:08:47,044
[SPEAKER_03]: I seriously want to know what's so freaking sad about this game.

147
00:08:47,064 --> 00:08:47,985
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know, it's...

148
00:08:48,325 --> 00:08:58,948
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind of got the sad music into it, and it's got, like, in the very beginning, it's talking about this kid who stopped taking his meds, and so you kind of get the feeling maybe he's dead or something like that.

149
00:08:59,148 --> 00:09:00,409
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, that's kind of sad.

150
00:09:00,749 --> 00:09:04,870
[SPEAKER_03]: Most gamers have cold black hearts after playing Doom 3 for hours on end, you know, so what?

151
00:09:05,511 --> 00:09:05,931
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.

152
00:09:06,891 --> 00:09:08,311
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's well done.

153
00:09:08,351 --> 00:09:09,492
[SPEAKER_01]: The art's really good in it.

154
00:09:09,992 --> 00:09:13,673
[SPEAKER_01]: It runs on almost, you know, most PCs nowadays.

155
00:09:13,713 --> 00:09:16,134
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't require, like, a huge graphics card or anything, so...

156
00:09:17,185 --> 00:09:18,166
[SPEAKER_01]: I would definitely check it out.

157
00:09:30,916 --> 00:09:32,557
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for watching!

158
00:09:53,268 --> 00:09:57,550
[SPEAKER_03]: But there are some of the games I want to check out that are coming out, including Animal Crossing this week.

159
00:09:57,930 --> 00:10:04,173
[SPEAKER_03]: Final Fantasy 4 Advance, which I believe is this week or was last week.

160
00:10:04,193 --> 00:10:04,954
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's this week.

161
00:10:05,034 --> 00:10:06,214
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's very, very soon.

162
00:10:06,254 --> 00:10:06,634
[SPEAKER_03]: I know that.

163
00:10:07,115 --> 00:10:11,577
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's pretty much all that's on my must-play list between now and Christmas.

164
00:10:12,117 --> 00:10:15,419
[SPEAKER_03]: Otherwise, I'll just kind of check things out as I play them or come across them.

165
00:10:15,499 --> 00:10:16,039
[SPEAKER_03]: They look cool.

166
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:20,662
[SPEAKER_03]: Otherwise, for me, honestly, it's been a lot of Dragon Quest VIII, which I talked about last week already.

167
00:10:21,542 --> 00:10:22,002
[SPEAKER_03]: Great game.

168
00:10:22,222 --> 00:10:22,803
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm loving it.

169
00:10:22,863 --> 00:10:28,406
[SPEAKER_03]: It's an old-style RPG, and it's what I remember from the great Super Nintendo.

170
00:10:28,446 --> 00:10:30,767
[SPEAKER_03]: It kind of is a throwback to the Super Nintendo RPGs.

171
00:10:31,207 --> 00:10:32,167
[SPEAKER_03]: It's holding my attention.

172
00:10:32,768 --> 00:10:33,848
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's pretty much it.

173
00:10:33,908 --> 00:10:37,610
[SPEAKER_03]: I've got just a lot of stuff going on in my personal life, so I can't do a lot of games this week.

174
00:10:37,630 --> 00:10:40,292
[SPEAKER_03]: But next week, for sure, Animal Crossing and probably Final Fantasy.

175
00:10:40,492 --> 00:10:42,072
[SPEAKER_03]: I will definitely be all up on that.

176
00:10:43,513 --> 00:10:44,854
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's get into some gaming news, shall we?

177
00:10:46,412 --> 00:10:54,215
[SPEAKER_03]: Speaking of things that are like 15 years old, I know this is an odd thing to lead off as a top story, but damn, this was so weird.

178
00:10:54,295 --> 00:10:59,257
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki, you've got to tell me about what you saw in this message form about a chip that's very old.

179
00:10:59,737 --> 00:11:00,697
[SPEAKER_03]: What is going on with this?

180
00:11:02,118 --> 00:11:09,741
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, at Benhek.com, because you've got to love that stuff, they were talking about how they've overclocked the Super FX chip.

181
00:11:10,001 --> 00:11:13,182
[SPEAKER_01]: And for those who might not remember, that's the chip that was in

182
00:11:13,615 --> 00:11:18,257
[SPEAKER_01]: Those wonderful 3D games, you know, back in Star Fox and Stunt Race FX.

183
00:11:18,297 --> 00:11:18,997
[SPEAKER_03]: Off-road, yeah.

184
00:11:19,097 --> 00:11:19,357
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, no.

185
00:11:20,738 --> 00:11:22,118
[SPEAKER_03]: There was an off-road game that had it, too.

186
00:11:22,178 --> 00:11:23,299
[SPEAKER_03]: I think there was another driving game.

187
00:11:23,739 --> 00:11:24,599
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't remember.

188
00:11:24,719 --> 00:11:28,300
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, Stunt Race FX was that stupid, stupid, stupid game.

189
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:29,301
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe I'm getting it confused.

190
00:11:29,641 --> 00:11:32,122
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyways, a bunch of other stuff.

191
00:11:32,562 --> 00:11:39,185
[SPEAKER_01]: And what they've done is there's a timing chip that's on this actual, you know, rip the card apart and actually look at the circuit board.

192
00:11:39,565 --> 00:11:42,286
[SPEAKER_01]: And what they've done is replace that with a different chip.

193
00:11:42,666 --> 00:11:42,806
[SPEAKER_01]: And...

194
00:11:43,797 --> 00:12:01,876
[SPEAKER_01]: What that has done is actually now things are moving faster, it's less lag, so when they get to a scene with lots of enemies in the background, it does not slow down, just better frame rate and stuff, which is kind of neat, because you've got to love everybody hacking stuff.

195
00:12:02,759 --> 00:12:03,200
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

196
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:09,266
[SPEAKER_03]: This is weird that this is so old, yet people are still messing with this stuff.

197
00:12:09,366 --> 00:12:13,750
[SPEAKER_03]: This is kind of neat, diehard fan stuff.

198
00:12:14,231 --> 00:12:17,474
[SPEAKER_03]: If I wasn't afraid, I would screw up my Super Nintendo.

199
00:12:17,534 --> 00:12:19,456
[SPEAKER_03]: Honestly, I don't even have a working Super Nintendo anymore.

200
00:12:19,496 --> 00:12:23,440
[SPEAKER_03]: If I wasn't afraid, I would screw up a valuable Star Fox cartridge by doing this.

201
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:24,561
[SPEAKER_03]: It almost sounds like fun.

202
00:12:25,953 --> 00:12:29,454
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, except that you can find them for $2 at the thrift store.

203
00:12:29,854 --> 00:12:31,454
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought they were worth more than that.

204
00:12:31,854 --> 00:12:32,195
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, crap.

205
00:12:32,215 --> 00:12:34,815
[SPEAKER_05]: They are, but if you look at the thrift store, they'll sell... Really?

206
00:12:35,035 --> 00:12:39,116
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, you know, I see copies of, what was it, Casey Munchkin?

207
00:12:39,596 --> 00:12:39,856
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh-huh.

208
00:12:40,356 --> 00:12:43,537
[SPEAKER_05]: On some of those auctions selling for a little bit more.

209
00:12:43,557 --> 00:12:43,857
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

210
00:12:44,277 --> 00:12:48,018
[SPEAKER_05]: I bought my copies, several of them, for $0.99 at the thrift store.

211
00:12:48,058 --> 00:12:49,959
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah, because they don't know the real value of that stuff.

212
00:12:49,979 --> 00:12:50,479
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.

213
00:12:50,659 --> 00:12:53,100
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, and people who just donate bags and bags.

214
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:53,960
[SPEAKER_03]: Interesting.

215
00:12:55,464 --> 00:13:00,707
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, let's talk about some news going on with Final Fantasy XII, DarkSakura.

216
00:13:00,727 --> 00:13:02,709
[SPEAKER_03]: What do you know about what's going on with the release in Japan?

217
00:13:03,469 --> 00:13:05,791
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I know they're planning on charging a bit more for it.

218
00:13:06,631 --> 00:13:13,135
[SPEAKER_05]: Typically, PS2 games retail for about 7,410 yen.

219
00:13:14,776 --> 00:13:19,059
[SPEAKER_05]: However, they're saying that the launch price is going to be 8,990 yen.

220
00:13:21,588 --> 00:13:21,829
[SPEAKER_03]: Ouch.

221
00:13:22,069 --> 00:13:25,493
[SPEAKER_05]: Which is about, yeah, 85, 86 bucks.

222
00:13:25,774 --> 00:13:26,335
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.

223
00:13:26,495 --> 00:13:29,138
[SPEAKER_03]: But games are typically more expensive in Japan anyway, right?

224
00:13:29,259 --> 00:13:30,440
[SPEAKER_03]: That's not a big deal.

225
00:13:30,460 --> 00:13:33,684
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, but... But if you're going to import this, you're going to be paying that.

226
00:13:33,945 --> 00:13:36,188
[SPEAKER_05]: They're popping the price up on that one.

227
00:13:36,528 --> 00:13:36,849
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.

228
00:13:36,909 --> 00:13:38,731
[SPEAKER_05]: Just for conversion's sake, that's about 43 pounds.

229
00:13:40,111 --> 00:13:40,512
[SPEAKER_03]: Amazing.

230
00:13:40,872 --> 00:13:44,095
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, do you think that's going to have an effect on the release here?

231
00:13:44,135 --> 00:13:48,739
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you think that we're going to end up paying a real high-end price such as $59.99 for this?

232
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:55,186
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, Squinnix hasn't commented on anything, but I'm thinking it's probably going to be a likelihood.

233
00:13:55,766 --> 00:13:57,388
[SPEAKER_03]: At least bank on $49.99 if nothing else.

234
00:13:59,013 --> 00:13:59,533
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura.com

235
00:14:19,568 --> 00:14:20,709
[SPEAKER_03]: Now did you hear about this?

236
00:14:21,449 --> 00:14:31,397
[SPEAKER_03]: When they release this in Japan on March 16th, actually Squeenix teamed up with somebody called Suntory who makes these drinks, these basically herbal drinks.

237
00:14:31,717 --> 00:14:34,519
[SPEAKER_03]: They're going to release Final Fantasy XII Potion.

238
00:14:34,959 --> 00:14:38,582
[SPEAKER_03]: They're these blue crystal drink looking things that are basically...

239
00:14:38,982 --> 00:14:46,445
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, you know the power drinks we have here in America, the Buku and the Rockstar and Red Bull being probably the most popular of them all.

240
00:14:47,585 --> 00:14:55,548
[SPEAKER_03]: It's basically something like that, except they say this will be a mysterious flavor, the potion, and will be made from various herbs.

241
00:14:55,588 --> 00:15:00,930
[SPEAKER_03]: And of course they're going to do all these lame tie-ins about, you know, it'll regenerate your HP with all the herbal goodness.

242
00:15:01,350 --> 00:15:02,230
[SPEAKER_03]: Wah, wah, wah.

243
00:15:02,310 --> 00:15:02,871
[SPEAKER_03]: Stuff like that.

244
00:15:03,311 --> 00:15:05,412
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know, you think that's something that could work over here?

245
00:15:05,632 --> 00:15:06,532
[SPEAKER_03]: Final Fantasy Potion?

246
00:15:07,665 --> 00:15:15,311
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, looking at the ingredients in it though, hyssop and lemon balm, they are, okay, I worked at GNC for a very long time and an herb shop.

247
00:15:15,611 --> 00:15:18,534
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, those are fairly sedative herbs.

248
00:15:18,814 --> 00:15:23,738
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd have to see the ingredient list, the full list, but I would buy it.

249
00:15:24,098 --> 00:15:27,241
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, instead of having an energy drink, why not have a drink that relaxes you?

250
00:15:27,731 --> 00:15:29,592
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's a good idea.

251
00:15:29,912 --> 00:15:32,253
[SPEAKER_05]: Although I don't think I need my HP to go up anymore.

252
00:15:32,273 --> 00:15:35,234
[SPEAKER_03]: Even though I have the plague.

253
00:15:35,334 --> 00:15:38,055
[SPEAKER_03]: This will be the rage at anime conventions.

254
00:15:38,335 --> 00:15:38,895
[SPEAKER_03]: Seriously.

255
00:15:39,315 --> 00:15:48,579
[SPEAKER_03]: The kid who imports a case of this, if they don't end up releasing it here, a kid who imports the case of this will be the most loved at the anime conventions.

256
00:15:49,540 --> 00:15:50,161
[SPEAKER_06]: I got my potion.

257
00:15:50,201 --> 00:15:53,085
[SPEAKER_05]: It had the thing about the premium box bundle, right?

258
00:15:53,345 --> 00:15:58,211
[SPEAKER_05]: With the specially designed bottle and the Final Fantasy XII art museum card.

259
00:15:59,588 --> 00:15:59,948
[SPEAKER_03]: Very cool.

260
00:16:00,429 --> 00:16:01,169
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki, what do you think?

261
00:16:01,529 --> 00:16:01,929
[SPEAKER_02]: Potion?

262
00:16:02,190 --> 00:16:02,570
[SPEAKER_02]: Good thing?

263
00:16:02,590 --> 00:16:02,850
[SPEAKER_02]: Bad thing?

264
00:16:02,910 --> 00:16:03,470
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not buying it.

265
00:16:03,510 --> 00:16:05,512
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't buy those energy drinks anyway.

266
00:16:05,872 --> 00:16:06,912
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not an energy drink.

267
00:16:06,952 --> 00:16:07,733
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a calming drink.

268
00:16:07,873 --> 00:16:08,513
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, whatever.

269
00:16:08,533 --> 00:16:09,774
[SPEAKER_01]: I still buy that stuff.

270
00:16:09,874 --> 00:16:11,575
[SPEAKER_01]: If it's got herbs in it, forget it.

271
00:16:11,996 --> 00:16:14,217
[SPEAKER_03]: When they release a drink called Ether, wake me up.

272
00:16:16,678 --> 00:16:17,319
[SPEAKER_03]: Moving on.

273
00:16:17,379 --> 00:16:18,159
[SPEAKER_03]: Other stories.

274
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:21,461
[SPEAKER_03]: What's going on with WoW?

275
00:16:21,962 --> 00:16:25,204
[SPEAKER_03]: We were talking about hacking the Super FX.

276
00:16:25,244 --> 00:16:27,325
[SPEAKER_03]: What's being hacked in World of Warcraft, Jamie?

277
00:16:28,140 --> 00:16:31,608
[SPEAKER_05]: Well we have SUPER HOT XXX NUDE ORCS!

278
00:16:33,809 --> 00:16:45,115
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, someone basically hacked it to have all the female characters, orcs, humans, gnomes, night elves, dwarves, trolls, undead, whatever, get naked.

279
00:16:46,155 --> 00:16:52,559
[SPEAKER_05]: But Blizzard's probably going to be, of course, cracking down on that one, so the only way you can get it would probably be on a private server.

280
00:16:52,779 --> 00:16:54,580
[SPEAKER_03]: You knew this shit would happen eventually.

281
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:56,221
[SPEAKER_03]: It's because people are perverts.

282
00:16:56,301 --> 00:17:00,483
[SPEAKER_03]: Release a video game for the computer with a woman in it, and somebody will get her naked.

283
00:17:00,983 --> 00:17:01,403
[SPEAKER_02]: Troll boobies!

284
00:17:01,423 --> 00:17:02,624
[SPEAKER_02]: There's nothing they can do.

285
00:17:03,902 --> 00:17:04,744
[SPEAKER_02]: There's nothing they can do.

286
00:17:04,764 --> 00:17:07,873
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, especially when WoW is so patch-friendly anyway.

287
00:17:07,933 --> 00:17:10,821
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, mine is bogged down with all these patches like the Oct...

288
00:17:12,938 --> 00:17:19,444
[SPEAKER_03]: that show you how long estimated to get to your next level and just all this crap on there that makes the game take forever to load.

289
00:17:19,724 --> 00:17:28,853
[SPEAKER_03]: But since Blizzard is so friendly at supporting this stuff, whereas other games, Final Fantasy XI, do not support these things, it kind of makes it easier for these types of patches to go into effect.

290
00:17:28,873 --> 00:17:33,797
[SPEAKER_01]: People have been modding Final Fantasy XI to do this already.

291
00:17:34,218 --> 00:17:35,038
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not a surprise.

292
00:17:35,078 --> 00:17:35,859
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just saying.

293
00:17:36,259 --> 00:17:38,742
[SPEAKER_03]: Blizzard kind of embracing it makes it...

294
00:17:39,523 --> 00:17:39,883
[SPEAKER_03]: Smash Bros.

295
00:18:00,236 --> 00:18:01,937
[SPEAKER_03]: The creator of the Smash Bros.

296
00:18:01,978 --> 00:18:18,312
[SPEAKER_03]: series has said in the latest issue of the Japanese Game Bible Famitsu, what's going to happen is that Mashihiro Sakurai is actually coming back to Nintendo after being gone for two years, saying that he will be doing a new Super Smash Bros.

297
00:18:18,352 --> 00:18:21,995
[SPEAKER_03]: game for the Revolution, to which many Nintendo fanboys are cheering.

298
00:18:22,695 --> 00:18:25,658
[SPEAKER_03]: I think this was kind of a given that there would definitely have to be some type of Smash Bros.

299
00:18:25,698 --> 00:18:26,359
[SPEAKER_03]: on Revolution.

300
00:18:26,959 --> 00:18:27,439
[SPEAKER_03]: One word...

301
00:18:28,380 --> 00:18:31,362
[SPEAKER_03]: Pit from, actually no, there's four words, Pit from Kid Icarus.

302
00:18:31,382 --> 00:18:32,303
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, thanks.

303
00:18:32,503 --> 00:18:33,104
[SPEAKER_03]: We need Pit.

304
00:18:33,704 --> 00:18:34,164
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely.

305
00:18:34,325 --> 00:18:35,045
[SPEAKER_03]: Or Eggplant Wizard.

306
00:18:35,105 --> 00:18:36,926
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I was going to say we need Eggplant Wizard.

307
00:18:36,946 --> 00:18:38,187
[SPEAKER_05]: We know who we need, actually.

308
00:18:38,708 --> 00:18:40,369
[SPEAKER_05]: We need us a Mega Man.

309
00:18:41,410 --> 00:18:43,011
[SPEAKER_03]: But that's not Nintendo, that's Capcom.

310
00:18:43,031 --> 00:18:43,992
[SPEAKER_05]: That's true, that's Capcom.

311
00:18:44,732 --> 00:18:46,714
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, then we need somebody to make friends at Capcom.

312
00:18:47,694 --> 00:18:55,140
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know why, well, I was just, I had it in my head, though, thinking, it was another character I'm trying to think of that was, I don't know, what if we have Nintendogs?

313
00:18:57,642 --> 00:18:58,583
[SPEAKER_05]: They come out as helpers.

314
00:18:58,603 --> 00:19:01,325
[SPEAKER_03]: Dalmatians start ripping Mario flesh.

315
00:19:01,605 --> 00:19:02,125
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, God.

316
00:19:02,625 --> 00:19:03,026
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

317
00:19:04,367 --> 00:19:05,587
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, no, ammonia burn.

318
00:19:06,788 --> 00:19:07,769
[SPEAKER_03]: Or Animal Crossing.

319
00:19:07,989 --> 00:19:08,349
[SPEAKER_03]: K.K.

320
00:19:08,389 --> 00:19:10,131
[SPEAKER_03]: Slider comes and whacks you with his guitar.

321
00:19:11,251 --> 00:19:12,212
[SPEAKER_03]: We need Rob the Robot.

322
00:19:13,215 --> 00:19:14,977
[SPEAKER_03]: One of the weapons you get is a power glove.

323
00:19:37,620 --> 00:19:38,961
[SPEAKER_03]: Lame, lame, lame.

324
00:19:39,201 --> 00:19:39,781
[SPEAKER_05]: No way.

325
00:19:40,462 --> 00:19:43,404
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's talk about some games that are coming out like within this.

326
00:19:43,484 --> 00:19:43,984
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, actually, no.

327
00:19:44,044 --> 00:19:48,807
[SPEAKER_03]: Before we get to that, Nintendo in the UK is doing something kind of interesting.

328
00:19:50,638 --> 00:19:53,159
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, there are downloadable ringtones available.

329
00:19:53,279 --> 00:19:57,420
[SPEAKER_05]: That is if you are a member of their little club thing.

330
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:59,981
[SPEAKER_05]: They have the Nintendo VIP 24-7 Club.

331
00:20:00,641 --> 00:20:10,765
[SPEAKER_05]: You'll be able to, after December 5th, you will be able to turn in your stars that you've collected to buy ringtones from the Nintendo of Europe website.

332
00:20:12,111 --> 00:20:13,832
[SPEAKER_05]: They said they've got 20 to choose from.

333
00:20:13,892 --> 00:20:18,296
[SPEAKER_05]: There's The Legend of Zelda, Metroid Prime, Super Mario Bros.

334
00:20:20,118 --> 00:20:23,161
[SPEAKER_05]: They say there are 350 stars each.

335
00:20:24,222 --> 00:20:28,085
[SPEAKER_05]: But there's also mobile wallpapers too at 150 stars apiece.

336
00:20:29,907 --> 00:20:31,108
[SPEAKER_05]: They're saying though that you...

337
00:20:33,143 --> 00:20:38,585
[SPEAKER_05]: Have to update your user profile by entering in your mobile number, your phone's makeup model.

338
00:20:39,265 --> 00:20:40,505
[SPEAKER_05]: You basically follow the instructions.

339
00:20:41,105 --> 00:20:52,329
[SPEAKER_03]: Kind of similar to what they do on the US side because I actually finally signed up for the US Nintendo thing because, you know, with the new console coming out and the DS Wi-Fi, I kind of wanted to get on board with whatever promotional things they might be doing.

340
00:20:52,369 --> 00:20:56,970
[SPEAKER_03]: So I went and I pulled all my DS games and I registered them all with Nintendo's site.

341
00:20:57,030 --> 00:20:58,551
[SPEAKER_03]: So hopefully I'll get some free crap.

342
00:20:58,731 --> 00:20:58,991
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

343
00:20:59,011 --> 00:20:59,231
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll see.

344
00:21:00,154 --> 00:21:08,780
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I remember when I did that, you know, back in the day when they were giving away that Zelda, you know, where it's the Zelda 1 and 2 and then... You didn't get shit, did you?

345
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:09,680
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I didn't get shit.

346
00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:14,483
[SPEAKER_01]: And I qualified for it, and they said they were going to send it, and they didn't send it, so... Aw, maybe somebody stole it.

347
00:21:14,503 --> 00:21:16,224
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe I stole it, because you were living with me at the time.

348
00:21:16,244 --> 00:21:16,304
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

349
00:21:16,365 --> 00:21:17,005
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

350
00:21:18,266 --> 00:21:23,869
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, they're also, though, they've just launched a new WAP portal for your mobile.

351
00:21:24,930 --> 00:21:26,611
[SPEAKER_05]: You go to wap.nintendo.co.uk.

352
00:21:28,581 --> 00:21:29,662
[SPEAKER_02]: Saken Densetsu DS

353
00:21:43,820 --> 00:21:46,461
[SPEAKER_03]: Estimated $42 when you convert the dollars over there.

354
00:21:47,302 --> 00:21:54,805
[SPEAKER_03]: No stateside release announced yet, but honestly guys, I think it's pretty much a given that this game will be making its way over here.

355
00:21:55,425 --> 00:21:58,426
[SPEAKER_03]: I would guess maybe next summer, next Christmas, I think is a fair guess.

356
00:21:58,907 --> 00:21:59,247
[SPEAKER_03]: Who knows?

357
00:21:59,427 --> 00:22:01,428
[SPEAKER_03]: It's all up to Squeenix on whatever they want to do.

358
00:22:02,108 --> 00:22:06,870
[SPEAKER_03]: But for those of you guys who like to import, you can do that on February 23rd, this latest entry from Japan.

359
00:22:08,187 --> 00:22:13,311
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki, you have something that a lot of gamers might want on their wish list this Christmas.

360
00:22:13,371 --> 00:22:17,853
[SPEAKER_03]: If you got about, what, $800, $1,000 to spare to get arcade games in your home, what's this about?

361
00:22:17,893 --> 00:22:18,594
[SPEAKER_01]: Less than that.

362
00:22:18,754 --> 00:22:19,034
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, wow.

363
00:22:19,154 --> 00:22:19,515
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, good.

364
00:22:19,755 --> 00:22:23,317
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, first off, there's a couple places you can get arcade games.

365
00:22:24,318 --> 00:22:32,843
[SPEAKER_01]: One of them being at Costco, and they're selling kind of a better package, but it's for about, I think, $2,000.

366
00:22:32,903 --> 00:22:33,644
[SPEAKER_01]: You can get a full-size...

367
00:22:37,783 --> 00:22:39,424
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sorry, $2,299.

368
00:22:39,744 --> 00:22:43,367
[SPEAKER_01]: You get a 2006 Ultimate Arcade stand-up unit.

369
00:22:43,407 --> 00:22:49,691
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, I'm not going to be confused with the Ultimate Arcade, you know, cabinet, which is something, like, I built for mine.

370
00:22:49,791 --> 00:22:56,095
[SPEAKER_01]: But anyways, it comes with 81 games, all from Atari and others, including Golden Tee and stuff.

371
00:22:56,796 --> 00:23:02,579
[SPEAKER_01]: It's covered in, like, different logos, like Capcom and stuff, which is kind of odd seeing as there's all Atari games in there, but...

372
00:23:04,525 --> 00:23:05,546
[SPEAKER_01]: Huge list of stuff.

373
00:23:25,123 --> 00:23:29,825
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, if you're not looking to spend $2,300 on something, Target has something more of your price.

374
00:23:30,645 --> 00:23:38,828
[SPEAKER_01]: Their cabinet, which sports a whopping 12 games, all from Midway, is $397, which is not bad for a game.

375
00:23:38,848 --> 00:23:43,830
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, considering that you could probably gut that thing and do something else with it, not a bad price.

376
00:23:43,990 --> 00:23:46,330
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's not a bad price if you want to gut it.

377
00:23:46,710 --> 00:23:53,873
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, granted, it is a little bit tiny, but it includes such wonderful things as Joust, Defender, 1-2, Robotron, Rampage,

378
00:23:54,741 --> 00:24:00,425
[SPEAKER_01]: Blatt, Satan's Hollow, Root Beer Tapper, Bubbles, Wizards of War, Timber, and Sinistar.

379
00:24:00,465 --> 00:24:02,326
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, hats off to Midway.

380
00:24:02,367 --> 00:24:03,788
[SPEAKER_03]: They know how to milk their old shit.

381
00:24:03,848 --> 00:24:04,328
[SPEAKER_01]: They really do.

382
00:24:04,408 --> 00:24:05,429
[SPEAKER_03]: Sinistar is awesome.

383
00:24:05,509 --> 00:24:07,130
[SPEAKER_03]: They know how to get the most out of their old stuff.

384
00:24:07,526 --> 00:24:09,567
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura.com is the place to send those emails.

385
00:24:09,647 --> 00:24:12,487
[SPEAKER_05]: And we'll read them and respond to them when we feel like it.

386
00:24:12,567 --> 00:24:13,928
[SPEAKER_05]: No, just kidding.

387
00:24:13,948 --> 00:24:15,428
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura always...

388
00:24:36,573 --> 00:24:36,713
[SPEAKER_03]: XBOX 360

389
00:25:04,096 --> 00:25:07,877
[SPEAKER_05]: A USB adapter.

390
00:25:09,197 --> 00:25:10,357
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, the wireless thing.

391
00:25:10,618 --> 00:25:10,798
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.

392
00:25:10,858 --> 00:25:11,558
[SPEAKER_03]: I heard about this.

393
00:25:12,098 --> 00:25:14,979
[SPEAKER_03]: Kind of taken a good idea from the Nintendo DS, honestly.

394
00:25:15,059 --> 00:25:17,979
[SPEAKER_03]: But hey, hey, it works.

395
00:25:19,079 --> 00:25:22,120
[SPEAKER_05]: Apparently what you can do with this, you can hook up a USB hard drive to your 360.

396
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:25,501
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, interesting.

397
00:25:25,561 --> 00:25:25,781
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

398
00:25:27,832 --> 00:25:33,517
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's see, it says on the actually linked website, all you need is the following, a hard drive of your choice.

399
00:25:35,318 --> 00:25:39,982
[SPEAKER_05]: It says the drive is not important as long as you can get a USB 2.0 adapter for that type of drive.

400
00:25:40,363 --> 00:25:44,766
[SPEAKER_05]: And then a USB 2.0 to ATA adapter for the type of drive you will be using.

401
00:25:44,786 --> 00:25:48,569
[SPEAKER_05]: That's pretty neat stuff.

402
00:25:48,950 --> 00:25:50,711
[SPEAKER_05]: Interesting.

403
00:25:51,372 --> 00:25:55,135
[SPEAKER_05]: Also, in other email here, as soon as I get back to...

404
00:25:55,996 --> 00:25:57,577
[SPEAKER_05]: Reach my hand back in the bag.

405
00:25:59,318 --> 00:26:01,219
[SPEAKER_05]: A little bit about the... That's not the mailbag.

406
00:26:03,341 --> 00:26:04,061
[SPEAKER_05]: Dot, dot, dot.

407
00:26:05,202 --> 00:26:05,542
[SPEAKER_03]: Go ahead.

408
00:26:05,902 --> 00:26:08,484
[SPEAKER_05]: ESRB is up to their old crap again.

409
00:26:09,044 --> 00:26:09,645
[SPEAKER_05]: Yay.

410
00:26:11,225 --> 00:26:14,548
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, that's a good thing, though, because they've got to fend off all this other stuff going on, right?

411
00:26:15,108 --> 00:26:15,468
[SPEAKER_03]: In a way?

412
00:26:15,908 --> 00:26:16,249
[SPEAKER_03]: Kind of?

413
00:26:16,529 --> 00:26:16,789
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe?

414
00:26:18,150 --> 00:26:19,791
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, they posted an article here.

415
00:26:19,811 --> 00:26:19,891
[SPEAKER_05]: Just...

416
00:26:26,454 --> 00:26:27,935
[SPEAKER_05]: ESRB Game Retailers Decried Bad Report Card

417
00:26:52,128 --> 00:27:04,581
[SPEAKER_05]: Ratings Education C+, Retailers Policies B, Retailers Enforcement D-, Ratings Accuracy F, Arcade Survey B-, and

418
00:27:08,598 --> 00:27:12,341
[SPEAKER_03]: The only reason they got that F in ratings accuracy is because that Grand Theft Auto thing slipped through.

419
00:27:12,421 --> 00:27:16,664
[SPEAKER_03]: And I still say to this day, Rockstar did not intend for that to get out.

420
00:27:16,745 --> 00:27:17,986
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a lazy programming thing.

421
00:27:18,146 --> 00:27:19,267
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a lazy programming thing.

422
00:27:19,287 --> 00:27:19,907
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a common programming thing.

423
00:27:19,927 --> 00:27:21,068
[SPEAKER_03]: That they never thought they would have to do.

424
00:27:21,088 --> 00:27:21,148
[SPEAKER_03]: Huh?

425
00:27:22,249 --> 00:27:25,471
[SPEAKER_05]: But there was just, you know, I love this comment here.

426
00:27:25,552 --> 00:27:30,976
[SPEAKER_05]: Parents exercising responsibility by not buying games intended for 17 year olds for their 10 year old.

427
00:27:32,157 --> 00:27:35,580
[SPEAKER_06]: F. Huh.

428
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:36,801
[SPEAKER_05]: Definitely need to be on there.

429
00:27:36,981 --> 00:27:37,221
[SPEAKER_05]: You know.

430
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:41,341
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to go ahead.

431
00:27:42,121 --> 00:27:45,643
[SPEAKER_05]: This article is actually on the Ars Technica website.

432
00:27:47,264 --> 00:27:51,226
[SPEAKER_05]: It really needs to be given a read by many of our listeners.

433
00:27:52,306 --> 00:27:55,368
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a pretty lengthy article.

434
00:27:55,388 --> 00:27:56,388
[SPEAKER_05]: It goes into a lot of details.

435
00:27:56,948 --> 00:28:06,473
[SPEAKER_05]: But I do think that it makes a pretty good point with the points going back and forth between the different facilities that are arguing about

436
00:28:06,980 --> 00:28:09,881
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, for the ratings or against the ratings or how effective they are.

437
00:28:10,842 --> 00:28:17,545
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I honestly think that the ratings themselves are pretty accurate, I would say.

438
00:28:18,325 --> 00:28:21,587
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just the fact that parents just don't look.

439
00:28:21,827 --> 00:28:22,387
[SPEAKER_05]: They don't care.

440
00:28:22,887 --> 00:28:23,307
[SPEAKER_03]: Interesting.

441
00:28:23,587 --> 00:28:28,690
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, this is going to tie into a story I have coming up as soon as you're done with mail.

442
00:28:28,730 --> 00:28:28,870
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

443
00:28:28,910 --> 00:28:29,190
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that it?

444
00:28:29,230 --> 00:28:29,770
[SPEAKER_03]: Was that it for mail?

445
00:28:30,511 --> 00:28:30,671
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

446
00:28:30,991 --> 00:28:31,111
[SPEAKER_03]: No?

447
00:28:31,371 --> 00:28:31,591
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

448
00:28:32,131 --> 00:28:32,391
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

449
00:28:32,752 --> 00:28:32,912
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

450
00:28:35,255 --> 00:28:43,878
[SPEAKER_05]: There's also another one he linked about 400,000 Xbox 360s being sold.

451
00:28:45,318 --> 00:28:45,678
[SPEAKER_05]: What?

452
00:28:45,838 --> 00:28:46,358
[SPEAKER_05]: Really?

453
00:28:48,479 --> 00:28:50,319
[SPEAKER_05]: They have to be stacking those numbers.

454
00:28:50,379 --> 00:28:52,060
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that how many they really put out on shelves?

455
00:28:52,120 --> 00:28:52,860
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that maybe 400,000 worldwide?

456
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:56,341
[SPEAKER_01]: No, they're estimating 400,000 launched in the US, 300,000 in the UK.

457
00:29:01,570 --> 00:29:01,950
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.

458
00:29:03,211 --> 00:29:04,913
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know, it just seems like nobody I know has one.

459
00:29:05,393 --> 00:29:14,660
[SPEAKER_03]: So, maybe a couple people online I know, but nobody I know has one, whereas everybody I know has PS2s, well, whatever, who cares.

460
00:29:16,081 --> 00:29:16,722
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just a launch.

461
00:29:17,422 --> 00:29:22,346
[SPEAKER_05]: And you know, this crap about them not having the systems, I'm sorry, that's so much utter crap.

462
00:29:22,887 --> 00:29:23,227
[SPEAKER_03]: How so?

463
00:29:23,848 --> 00:29:24,268
[SPEAKER_05]: Just because...

464
00:29:26,457 --> 00:29:35,081
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know how fast they're manufacturing, or maybe it's because they're trying to manufacture them so quick is why they're such, you know, kind of bad quality.

465
00:29:35,541 --> 00:29:37,302
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, why so many of them are having issues.

466
00:29:37,462 --> 00:29:39,183
[SPEAKER_05]: Even, you know, my Xbox has issues.

467
00:29:40,343 --> 00:29:43,505
[SPEAKER_05]: It froze like three times while we were playing Ridge Racer 6.

468
00:29:44,885 --> 00:29:46,806
[SPEAKER_03]: This is why I'm glad I decided to wait a little bit.

469
00:29:46,846 --> 00:29:48,567
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe they'll work some of this stuff out in 2006.

470
00:29:49,067 --> 00:29:49,647
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

471
00:29:49,728 --> 00:29:52,609
[SPEAKER_05]: We're probably going to end up, I don't know, trading ours in...

472
00:29:53,706 --> 00:29:54,126
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura.com

473
00:30:22,389 --> 00:30:24,231
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I want to wait for actual numbers.

474
00:30:24,912 --> 00:30:27,314
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't buy this estimate thing.

475
00:30:29,076 --> 00:30:30,318
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, anything else?

476
00:30:31,192 --> 00:30:35,513
[SPEAKER_04]: There were a few others, but we'll go ahead to whatever you had.

477
00:30:52,719 --> 00:30:56,560
[SPEAKER_03]: Talk about this bill that they are going to propose when Congress reconvenes in two weeks.

478
00:30:56,620 --> 00:31:03,583
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the Family Entertainment Protection Act, and it will pretty much be suggesting that we govern a few things.

479
00:31:03,743 --> 00:31:15,207
[SPEAKER_03]: Step one, basically that it's going to be trying to get businesses to not sell a mature adults-only or ratings-pending game to a person who's younger than 17.

480
00:31:16,027 --> 00:31:17,888
[SPEAKER_03]: First thing I should note is that this bill

481
00:31:19,102 --> 00:31:29,909
[SPEAKER_03]: contrary to the California bill that was passed under the bills, actually embraces the ESRB rating system and sort of uses that as the guide as to what they consider mature and what's not.

482
00:31:30,049 --> 00:31:42,598
[SPEAKER_03]: And for that, I kind of say I applaud this bill where other bills I think have kind of failed is that the other bills made it, at least the California one that I was pretty familiar with, made it way too vague what exactly a mature game is.

483
00:31:43,058 --> 00:31:45,680
[SPEAKER_03]: This makes the board do it, which I think is kind of interesting.

484
00:31:46,140 --> 00:31:48,682
[SPEAKER_03]: Step two calls for mandated yearly review.

485
00:31:49,363 --> 00:32:06,321
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, step three, the FTC, Federal Trade Commission, can conduct an investigation when misconstances happen, as they will do with Grand Theft Auto, San Andreas, to see if it was done purposefully, which I do truly believe they will find it was not.

486
00:32:06,841 --> 00:32:07,061
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

487
00:32:07,962 --> 00:32:12,304
[SPEAKER_03]: Step four, consumers can file complaints with the Federal Trade Commission when they disagree.

488
00:32:13,325 --> 00:32:20,548
[SPEAKER_03]: And then the FTC would also be audited regularly to make sure that the ESRB is doing their job and everything.

489
00:32:21,229 --> 00:32:26,191
[SPEAKER_03]: I actually, although I do believe the bottom line is that

490
00:32:27,571 --> 00:32:28,352
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for watching.

491
00:32:28,372 --> 00:32:28,892
[SPEAKER_03]: See you next time.

492
00:32:52,892 --> 00:32:56,995
[SPEAKER_03]: Everything is running as it should be, and I don't think that's necessarily a bad thing.

493
00:32:57,075 --> 00:33:01,138
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm not so much on the doom and gloom page as everybody else is on with this.

494
00:33:01,218 --> 00:33:07,242
[SPEAKER_03]: Although I do understand the argument that, you know what, why don't parents just frickin' read the labels?

495
00:33:08,022 --> 00:33:10,844
[SPEAKER_05]: I find it disgusting that we've had to come to this.

496
00:33:12,265 --> 00:33:18,589
[SPEAKER_05]: That, first of all, there's not as much honesty, I think, in the marketing of some of these games.

497
00:33:19,850 --> 00:33:20,170
[SPEAKER_05]: You know...

498
00:33:22,659 --> 00:33:25,501
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think they're particularly hiding their content, you know?

499
00:33:26,661 --> 00:33:39,489
[SPEAKER_05]: But I also don't think that they are 100% accurate about the level of some of the things that are in some of the games and are hiding behind the rating system to see what they can eek past.

500
00:33:40,150 --> 00:33:41,030
[SPEAKER_05]: It's how movies do.

501
00:33:41,871 --> 00:33:44,312
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, true, true.

502
00:33:44,432 --> 00:33:48,275
[SPEAKER_03]: I think there should be consistency between games and movies, though, and I've said that a long time ago.

503
00:33:48,295 --> 00:33:49,976
[SPEAKER_03]: I think they should be using the same rating system.

504
00:33:50,934 --> 00:34:06,266
[SPEAKER_05]: But I think that if it is proven that the actions of a child are based directly off of an event in a video game, their parents need to be held liable for neglect, for being negligent in what their children are doing.

505
00:34:07,007 --> 00:34:13,592
[SPEAKER_05]: It is not the job of the government, nor is it the job of video game companies to decide what children play.

506
00:34:14,653 --> 00:34:18,136
[SPEAKER_05]: It is the job of the parent to censor what their children look at.

507
00:34:19,694 --> 00:34:40,187
[SPEAKER_05]: and where me myself you know I know when I have kids I'm gonna you know I basically got to look at whatever I wanted to when I was younger and I grew up fine and responsible because I grew up prepared for it that's how I feel I know that that's how I'm going to be with my children if they do something bad as a result of a game they don't get to play the game anymore

508
00:34:40,987 --> 00:34:41,287
[SPEAKER_05]: Demon Spawn!

509
00:34:41,368 --> 00:34:41,688
[SPEAKER_05]: Just kidding.

510
00:34:59,241 --> 00:35:18,665
[SPEAKER_05]: but um I think that I feel very strongly that it's the job of the parent to ultimately decide if their child's going to be allowed to have something and I think that if their child is going behind their back and getting these games or trading with their friends and parents need to say no you're going to give me that and we're taking it back

511
00:35:20,693 --> 00:35:24,716
[SPEAKER_05]: They need to, you know, and I know kids are going to hide stuff and try to get away with stuff.

512
00:35:24,836 --> 00:35:26,738
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I was that way when I was a kid.

513
00:35:27,238 --> 00:35:31,141
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know what child didn't try to get something past their parents at some point or another.

514
00:35:31,521 --> 00:35:36,204
[SPEAKER_05]: And parents, please do not lie to me and say that your children are perfect angels because we know what kids are like.

515
00:35:36,985 --> 00:35:38,826
[SPEAKER_05]: We were all kids once, right?

516
00:35:39,126 --> 00:35:40,067
[SPEAKER_05]: We were all there.

517
00:35:40,607 --> 00:35:48,053
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, no child is going to be perfectly well behaved and even if it looks like they're perfectly well behaved, you know damn well they're trying something behind your back.

518
00:35:49,133 --> 00:35:50,494
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the nature of being a kid.

519
00:35:50,794 --> 00:35:53,395
[SPEAKER_05]: You have to go through your rebellious phase and then you grow out of it.

520
00:35:54,395 --> 00:35:55,056
[SPEAKER_05]: Part of growing up.

521
00:35:56,096 --> 00:35:57,397
[SPEAKER_05]: But still, I digress.

522
00:35:57,417 --> 00:36:04,660
[SPEAKER_05]: I really do think that it, you know, and I know that not all parents are like this.

523
00:36:04,740 --> 00:36:10,583
[SPEAKER_05]: Not all of them are really irresponsible, but I have met plenty who are.

524
00:36:12,104 --> 00:36:17,126
[SPEAKER_05]: All the ones that you see on television who are like, my child, my mom, my dad, my mom.

525
00:36:18,454 --> 00:36:19,835
[SPEAKER_05]: It's their fault.

526
00:36:20,275 --> 00:36:24,658
[SPEAKER_03]: Seriously, go observe at a GameStop or an EB game sometime.

527
00:36:24,698 --> 00:36:29,181
[SPEAKER_03]: Just kind of lurk in the corner and kind of listen to some of the counter conversations between parents and kids.

528
00:36:29,662 --> 00:36:30,542
[SPEAKER_03]: It is amazing.

529
00:36:30,722 --> 00:36:32,323
[SPEAKER_03]: It is amazing some of the stuff you would hear.

530
00:36:32,684 --> 00:36:33,204
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it is.

531
00:36:33,684 --> 00:36:34,165
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh my gosh.

532
00:36:34,185 --> 00:36:34,245
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.

533
00:36:35,625 --> 00:36:37,727
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think enough parents take...

534
00:36:38,852 --> 00:36:41,014
[SPEAKER_05]: enough of an active role in their children's upbringing.

535
00:36:41,134 --> 00:36:43,956
[SPEAKER_05]: And I understand being busy.

536
00:36:44,737 --> 00:36:47,139
[SPEAKER_05]: I know right now I would not be in a position to have a child.

537
00:36:47,619 --> 00:36:51,342
[SPEAKER_05]: As long as I'm working full-time and going to school, I am damn not having a child.

538
00:36:52,083 --> 00:37:05,574
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think that there are too many parents out there who are not dedicating the time they need to make sure that their children are doing what they should be, playing the right kind of game.

539
00:37:06,195 --> 00:37:07,636
[SPEAKER_05]: They're letting the game to babysit their children.

540
00:37:09,079 --> 00:37:11,101
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I'm sure we're going to get some emails on that.

541
00:37:11,282 --> 00:37:12,643
[SPEAKER_03]: I welcome them.

542
00:37:12,723 --> 00:37:14,205
[SPEAKER_05]: I really want to discuss it.

543
00:37:14,265 --> 00:37:16,708
[SPEAKER_03]: 2go at orangeloungeradio.com is the email.

544
00:37:17,068 --> 00:37:18,269
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki, though, what's your thought?

545
00:37:18,289 --> 00:37:22,073
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to let my kids just... They're only going to be able to play Grand Theft Auto on that.

546
00:37:22,094 --> 00:37:22,414
[SPEAKER_01]: That's it.

547
00:37:23,421 --> 00:37:24,642
[SPEAKER_03]: You're doing like an experiment.

548
00:37:24,882 --> 00:37:25,623
[SPEAKER_01]: No, screw that.

549
00:37:25,683 --> 00:37:26,684
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no experiment.

550
00:37:26,764 --> 00:37:28,105
[SPEAKER_01]: Why do we need to do this anyways?

551
00:37:28,485 --> 00:37:30,767
[SPEAKER_01]: This is all Hillary Clinton's fault.

552
00:37:30,847 --> 00:37:31,507
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know why?

553
00:37:32,148 --> 00:37:32,628
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, it is.

554
00:37:32,868 --> 00:37:33,348
[SPEAKER_01]: You know why?

555
00:37:33,428 --> 00:37:37,511
[SPEAKER_01]: Because she wants some sort of platform so she can campaign for fucking president.

556
00:37:37,531 --> 00:37:38,132
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what it is.

557
00:37:38,552 --> 00:37:39,653
[SPEAKER_01]: And I can tell you this much.

558
00:37:39,913 --> 00:37:40,674
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't need that.

559
00:37:40,714 --> 00:37:41,454
[SPEAKER_01]: Because why?

560
00:37:42,055 --> 00:37:47,098
[SPEAKER_01]: For one, we don't have any sort of laws saying that a child under 17...

561
00:37:51,362 --> 00:38:00,631
[SPEAKER_01]: I agree that if this is going to be against the law, then it should be against the law.

562
00:38:01,152 --> 00:38:06,537
[SPEAKER_03]: The theater should be held responsible when a kid sneaks into an R-rated film, which is something we all did when we were kids.

563
00:38:06,917 --> 00:38:08,459
[SPEAKER_03]: And besides, it's... Who snuck?

564
00:38:08,679 --> 00:38:09,200
[SPEAKER_05]: I just went.

565
00:38:09,900 --> 00:38:11,162
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to be just, you know...

566
00:38:11,716 --> 00:38:12,797
[SPEAKER_01]: It's still going to be the same problem.

567
00:38:12,837 --> 00:38:15,780
[SPEAKER_01]: So what, you make it against the law for a kid to buy the game.

568
00:38:15,861 --> 00:38:16,601
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, big deal.

569
00:38:16,862 --> 00:38:19,084
[SPEAKER_01]: The parents are buying the games for the kids anyway, so what's the matter?

570
00:38:19,184 --> 00:38:20,606
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you've solved nothing.

571
00:38:22,628 --> 00:38:30,216
[SPEAKER_05]: I honestly, though, have to say that I'm highly embarrassed to have Hillary Clinton as a representative of my gender.

572
00:38:31,437 --> 00:38:37,381
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, that's... I don't think it's as bad as people are making it out to be.

573
00:38:37,741 --> 00:38:40,163
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that... I kind of agree with what you're saying.

574
00:38:40,203 --> 00:38:45,106
[SPEAKER_03]: It's kind of sad that it's come to this, but I think that this bill is much better than bills in the past.

575
00:38:45,186 --> 00:38:46,967
[SPEAKER_03]: I think there's merit to this.

576
00:38:47,387 --> 00:38:53,091
[SPEAKER_05]: If they have to have one, then this one is more well thought out, I think.

577
00:38:54,251 --> 00:38:57,514
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I can't say that Hillary Clinton's a bitch because, you know, I think it's...

578
00:38:58,775 --> 00:39:08,192
[SPEAKER_03]: I give her credit for saying, okay, we have this ESRB, but the problem with it is it's regulated by the industry, so let's have the government regulate it, and then we could use this.

579
00:39:08,333 --> 00:39:10,417
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's the best idea.

580
00:39:11,608 --> 00:39:13,589
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sure I'll get an email or two on it.

581
00:39:13,609 --> 00:39:13,889
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure.

582
00:39:13,909 --> 00:39:17,850
[SPEAKER_01]: And have they solved the problems with pirates out there?

583
00:39:18,170 --> 00:39:18,270
[SPEAKER_01]: No.

584
00:39:18,910 --> 00:39:19,331
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, that's right.

585
00:39:19,351 --> 00:39:23,692
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe they should just focus on that and not on these two ratings.

586
00:39:24,972 --> 00:39:26,033
[SPEAKER_03]: Jack Sparrow is coming back.

587
00:39:26,073 --> 00:39:26,853
[SPEAKER_03]: Haven't you seen the trailer?

588
00:39:27,673 --> 00:39:29,094
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

589
00:39:29,134 --> 00:39:29,954
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm hilarious.

590
00:39:30,894 --> 00:39:31,975
[SPEAKER_03]: But seriously, folks.

591
00:39:32,575 --> 00:39:33,915
[SPEAKER_05]: I would like to receive the email.

592
00:39:33,995 --> 00:39:39,857
[SPEAKER_05]: I would love to hear from other parents, especially just on a personal note since, again, like I said, I'm planning on spawning soon.

593
00:39:40,216 --> 00:39:40,757
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

594
00:39:53,471 --> 00:40:01,919
[SPEAKER_05]: There is a very high degree of responsibility with the companies for what they market, but I strongly believe still that the ultimate power is in the hands of the parents.

595
00:40:02,300 --> 00:40:08,466
[SPEAKER_03]: And I assure you this, I will be emailing Senator Clinton and Senator Lieberman's office trying to get an interview.

596
00:40:08,787 --> 00:40:14,613
[SPEAKER_03]: And it probably won't happen, but I will email and try and allow them to present their perspective on the show if they so choose.

597
00:40:14,833 --> 00:40:16,834
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'd like to voice my opinion to the industry.

598
00:40:17,134 --> 00:40:18,234
[SPEAKER_01]: We need more games with TNA.

599
00:40:18,294 --> 00:40:20,135
[SPEAKER_01]: Because there's a lot more violent games out there.

600
00:40:20,435 --> 00:40:21,475
[SPEAKER_01]: Not enough nudity.

601
00:40:21,635 --> 00:40:27,637
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, you know, maybe having a bunch of nudie games will be like stress relief instead of insight violence.

602
00:40:27,997 --> 00:40:32,098
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, here's an interesting footnote now to all of this we've been talking about.

603
00:40:32,558 --> 00:40:35,760
[SPEAKER_03]: Illinois passed one of these gaming laws not that long ago.

604
00:40:36,941 --> 00:40:37,581
[SPEAKER_03]: Overturned.

605
00:40:38,041 --> 00:40:39,943
[SPEAKER_03]: It was supposed to go into effect January 1st of 2006.

606
00:40:40,643 --> 00:40:44,826
[SPEAKER_03]: However, a district judge ruled that it would violate First Amendment.

607
00:40:45,266 --> 00:40:46,787
[SPEAKER_03]: And so the bill was stricken.

608
00:40:47,607 --> 00:40:48,088
[SPEAKER_03]: Interesting.

609
00:40:48,948 --> 00:40:51,050
[SPEAKER_01]: Wait, amendment, amendment, constitution.

610
00:40:51,070 --> 00:40:53,551
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, those are those things that our government continuously ignores.

611
00:40:53,771 --> 00:40:54,752
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, that's right.

612
00:40:54,852 --> 00:40:55,392
[SPEAKER_01]: Constitution.

613
00:40:55,432 --> 00:40:56,933
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember the constitution.

614
00:40:56,953 --> 00:40:59,034
[SPEAKER_05]: We used to study that in elementary school.

615
00:40:59,475 --> 00:41:01,156
[SPEAKER_05]: But now they just teach it because they're forced to.

616
00:41:02,003 --> 00:41:02,983
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought this was interesting.

617
00:41:03,003 --> 00:41:04,424
[SPEAKER_03]: I have to say this.

618
00:41:04,484 --> 00:41:05,564
[SPEAKER_03]: You have to hear this, okay?

619
00:41:05,944 --> 00:41:08,785
[SPEAKER_03]: This was a 53-page ruling by Judge Kennelly.

620
00:41:09,165 --> 00:41:17,428
[SPEAKER_03]: He specifically talks about God of War and mentions a minigame where the character Kratos has sexual relations with two women.

621
00:41:18,409 --> 00:41:35,962
[SPEAKER_03]: Quote, Because of this one scene, a game such as God of War, which essentially parallels a classic book like The Odyssey, likely would be prohibited for minors under the SEVGL because the statute allows a game to be regulated based on one scene without regard to the value of the game as a whole.

622
00:41:36,462 --> 00:41:43,888
[SPEAKER_03]: Such a sweeping regulation on speech, even sexually explicit speech, is unconstitutional even if aimed at protecting minors.

623
00:41:45,749 --> 00:41:46,430
[SPEAKER_05]: I love this man.

624
00:41:47,332 --> 00:41:51,356
[SPEAKER_01]: The game does not show him having sex at all.

625
00:42:12,597 --> 00:42:13,998
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to get some emails.

626
00:42:14,118 --> 00:42:16,219
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm looking forward to it.

627
00:42:16,259 --> 00:42:19,562
[SPEAKER_03]: Because whenever we bring up politics, it's like angry emails.

628
00:42:19,622 --> 00:42:21,083
[SPEAKER_03]: Not just angry emails, but angry emails.

629
00:42:21,163 --> 00:42:26,866
[SPEAKER_05]: Honestly, the people that I know personally who grew up very sheltered still live with their parents.

630
00:42:28,087 --> 00:42:34,329
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, let's get back into some other gaming news and let's talk about those violent video games as well as the G-rated ones coming out very soon.

631
00:42:35,669 --> 00:42:38,109
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki, what kind of games can we expect coming out in the U.S.?

632
00:42:38,189 --> 00:42:41,510
[SPEAKER_03]: I know we're getting towards the end of the year, so not a lot, but what's coming out in the U.S.?

633
00:42:41,550 --> 00:42:48,752
[SPEAKER_01]: Not much, but it's really the only big things we've got coming out, especially this week, Animal Crossing and Final Fantasy.

634
00:42:49,272 --> 00:42:52,093
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, if you're more of a fan of the portable stuff, you've got...

635
00:42:53,291 --> 00:42:54,752
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of stuff for the PSP.

636
00:42:55,533 --> 00:43:02,237
[SPEAKER_01]: For example, Smackdown vs. Raw 06 is coming out finally for the PSP, which is good.

637
00:43:04,079 --> 00:43:07,361
[SPEAKER_01]: Other than that, December is a very dead month for games.

638
00:43:07,421 --> 00:43:12,664
[SPEAKER_01]: The biggest game probably coming out this month is going to be Gauntlet Seven Sorrows for the PlayStation 2 and Xbox.

639
00:43:14,266 --> 00:43:15,907
[SPEAKER_01]: But a lot of everything else has moved away.

640
00:43:15,987 --> 00:43:18,248
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, Dead Alive 4 coming out for the 360 on the 15th.

641
00:43:19,454 --> 00:43:20,595
[SPEAKER_03]: I heard they got pushed back again, though.

642
00:43:21,015 --> 00:43:24,757
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it was pushed to the 6th, and then they got pushed back to the 15th.

643
00:43:25,477 --> 00:43:27,779
[SPEAKER_01]: So, the 15th, hopefully.

644
00:43:29,600 --> 00:43:32,601
[SPEAKER_01]: But January, there's going to be a little bit more coming, hopefully.

645
00:43:33,142 --> 00:43:39,725
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got 25 to Life being the big one, the next cop-killer game that'll be coming out.

646
00:43:39,785 --> 00:43:41,866
[SPEAKER_01]: They'll be getting the press, I'm sure.

647
00:43:43,837 --> 00:43:45,077
[SPEAKER_01]: Ape Escape 3 Ape Escape Academy

648
00:44:05,868 --> 00:44:07,349
[SPEAKER_03]: DS and PSP, King Kong

649
00:44:29,864 --> 00:44:32,465
[SPEAKER_05]: on the Xbox and GameCube, Chronicles of Narnia.

650
00:44:33,086 --> 00:44:40,889
[SPEAKER_05]: We have WWE SmackDown vs. Raw 2006 for the PSP and The Sims 2 and King Kong on the Game Boy Advance.

651
00:44:41,750 --> 00:44:45,912
[SPEAKER_05]: Actually, and I do apologize because Sims 2 and King Kong are coming out on the 16th and 17th.

652
00:44:47,373 --> 00:44:52,095
[SPEAKER_05]: But I find it incredibly hilarious that the UK is getting a release of America's Army Rise of a Soldier.

653
00:44:53,172 --> 00:44:55,073
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it's a very popular game over here.

654
00:44:55,113 --> 00:45:00,635
[SPEAKER_03]: It's kind of got a little underground following that we don't talk about much, but I've run into a lot of people that are really into this game.

655
00:45:01,236 --> 00:45:09,819
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, it is supposed to be a fairly accurate representation, but I don't know why I find it funny that it's being released overseas.

656
00:45:12,412 --> 00:45:14,734
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki, you've got a story about Madden in general.

657
00:45:30,760 --> 00:45:31,120
[SPEAKER_01]: and so on.

658
00:45:55,717 --> 00:45:57,198
[SPEAKER_01]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

659
00:46:21,970 --> 00:46:22,631
[SPEAKER_01]: Three years later.

660
00:46:23,011 --> 00:46:25,572
[SPEAKER_05]: You also do the same thing in Derby Owners Club with horses.

661
00:46:26,373 --> 00:46:29,054
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, kind of, but... That's a little different.

662
00:46:29,074 --> 00:46:29,915
[SPEAKER_03]: A little different, yeah.

663
00:46:29,975 --> 00:46:30,896
[SPEAKER_05]: Breed your own human.

664
00:46:31,896 --> 00:46:32,677
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, interesting.

665
00:46:32,737 --> 00:46:33,797
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, we'll see what happens with that.

666
00:46:34,057 --> 00:46:36,879
[SPEAKER_03]: That'll be a fun court battle, or more likely, out-of-court settlement.

667
00:46:36,959 --> 00:46:37,860
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll see what happens with that.

668
00:46:38,719 --> 00:46:44,044
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura is here to remind us that there is a big world out there outside of gaming.

669
00:46:44,064 --> 00:46:50,409
[SPEAKER_03]: Because if all you did all day long was stay outside and play video games, you would have no time to go out and corrupt the youth of America.

670
00:46:51,030 --> 00:46:53,772
[SPEAKER_03]: So DarkSakura... She just gave me a face.

671
00:46:54,393 --> 00:46:54,973
[SPEAKER_03]: I got a face.

672
00:46:55,654 --> 00:46:57,275
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a knowing smile.

673
00:46:57,335 --> 00:47:02,460
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura is here to give us her advice column because there's a whole world outside.

674
00:47:02,540 --> 00:47:03,100
[SPEAKER_03]: Go live in it.

675
00:47:03,380 --> 00:47:05,082
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, what are you going to tell the kids about today?

676
00:47:05,560 --> 00:47:09,221
[SPEAKER_05]: Today's bit of advice is how to evade a stampede of shoppers.

677
00:47:10,122 --> 00:47:11,062
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, now this is good.

678
00:47:11,382 --> 00:47:12,643
[SPEAKER_03]: This is very timely.

679
00:47:13,623 --> 00:47:14,103
[SPEAKER_03]: I like this.

680
00:47:14,523 --> 00:47:14,964
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

681
00:47:15,744 --> 00:47:17,945
[SPEAKER_05]: Number one, react immediately.

682
00:47:18,405 --> 00:47:20,306
[SPEAKER_05]: Stay focused and visualize your goal.

683
00:47:20,366 --> 00:47:24,307
[SPEAKER_05]: Reacting early and decisively in crowds affords you your best shot at survival.

684
00:47:24,927 --> 00:47:28,329
[SPEAKER_05]: Two, do not join the herd.

685
00:47:29,369 --> 00:47:31,410
[SPEAKER_05]: You cannot shop if you cannot see the merchandise.

686
00:47:32,894 --> 00:47:35,996
[SPEAKER_05]: 3.

687
00:47:33,395 --> 00:47:35,996
[SPEAKER_05]: Do not move toward the herd.

688
00:47:36,817 --> 00:47:40,480
[SPEAKER_05]: You risk being trampled if you try to thread your way through a stampede.

689
00:47:41,140 --> 00:47:51,387
[SPEAKER_05]: If you are unable to get out of the way, bring your arms in tightly around any packages you are carrying, turn your body in the direction of the crowd, and let yourself be carried along as you work your way to the outside.

690
00:47:53,286 --> 00:47:55,127
[SPEAKER_05]: Maximize your movement options.

691
00:47:55,248 --> 00:47:58,230
[SPEAKER_05]: If you need to negotiate your way through a crowd, stay on the edge.

692
00:47:58,710 --> 00:48:04,094
[SPEAKER_05]: Most shoppers will leave at least a few feet between themselves and surrounding walls so you will have room to maneuver.

693
00:48:04,595 --> 00:48:08,077
[SPEAKER_05]: But my final bit of advice, just avoid the mall.

694
00:48:08,097 --> 00:48:10,879
[SPEAKER_05]: You don't need a tickle meal or whatever it is this year.

695
00:48:11,360 --> 00:48:12,861
[SPEAKER_03]: Seriously, I went to the mall today.

696
00:48:13,982 --> 00:48:14,782
[SPEAKER_03]: You went to the mall.

697
00:48:14,882 --> 00:48:15,923
[SPEAKER_03]: I know, I went to the mall.

698
00:48:15,943 --> 00:48:18,805
[SPEAKER_03]: I spent half my time looking for a parking space.

699
00:48:19,586 --> 00:48:19,866
[SPEAKER_03]: That's it.

700
00:48:21,317 --> 00:48:21,677
[SPEAKER_03]: Interesting.

701
00:48:21,837 --> 00:48:28,559
[SPEAKER_05]: Amazingly enough, last year I actually had a pretty easy time parking because I have mad parking lots going.

702
00:48:28,679 --> 00:48:29,239
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, no.

703
00:48:29,479 --> 00:48:31,280
[SPEAKER_03]: I even did the trick at the local mall.

704
00:48:31,300 --> 00:48:38,021
[SPEAKER_03]: What you do is you drive up the parking structure to the very, very top because there's a secret entrance to the mall that I thought nobody knew about.

705
00:48:38,082 --> 00:48:39,742
[SPEAKER_03]: But, oh, my God, completely full.

706
00:48:39,862 --> 00:48:41,803
[SPEAKER_03]: The parking lot at the top, completely full.

707
00:48:42,363 --> 00:48:43,483
[SPEAKER_05]: I follow people who leave.

708
00:48:44,960 --> 00:48:45,220
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I know.

709
00:48:45,240 --> 00:48:46,841
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what you're supposed to do in the city and stuff.

710
00:48:46,941 --> 00:48:47,661
[SPEAKER_03]: Whatever.

711
00:48:47,681 --> 00:48:48,141
[SPEAKER_03]: I stalk.

712
00:48:48,301 --> 00:48:48,701
[SPEAKER_03]: Whatever.

713
00:48:48,921 --> 00:48:49,201
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

714
00:48:49,442 --> 00:48:52,603
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, a couple quick last few items for you guys here.

715
00:48:52,623 --> 00:48:54,043
I have just a couple quick stories.

716
00:48:54,063 --> 00:48:56,324
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll go over to... Sorry, guys.

717
00:48:56,364 --> 00:48:57,124
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm having mic problems again.

718
00:48:57,644 --> 00:48:59,725
[SPEAKER_03]: A couple quick stories for you guys, and we'll go over to Loki.

719
00:49:01,005 --> 00:49:01,826
[SPEAKER_03]: I think this is interesting.

720
00:49:01,866 --> 00:49:04,707
[SPEAKER_03]: There's the Star Trek MMO that's coming out very soon.

721
00:49:05,067 --> 00:49:14,530
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, there was a study done, which was quizzing 600 gamers who were interested in both Star Trek and MMORPGs.

722
00:49:15,210 --> 00:49:19,072
[SPEAKER_03]: divided them into three subgroups based on their interest, blah blah blah blah blah.

723
00:49:19,392 --> 00:49:28,256
[SPEAKER_03]: The result, 69% of MMO players were interested in Star Trek Online, and 59% of Star Trek enthusiasts wanted to play the game.

724
00:49:28,596 --> 00:49:35,659
[SPEAKER_03]: However, only 31% of regular PC gamers were eager to jump onto Star Trek Online.

725
00:49:35,739 --> 00:49:36,919
[SPEAKER_03]: I gotta say, I'm curious.

726
00:49:37,319 --> 00:49:40,521
[SPEAKER_03]: I think there's a lot of interesting ideas they could do with a Star Trek game.

727
00:49:40,581 --> 00:49:43,882
[SPEAKER_03]: I wouldn't call myself a Trekkie, but I think it could make a decent game.

728
00:49:44,151 --> 00:49:45,022
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to play a cue.

729
00:49:47,990 --> 00:49:48,390
[SPEAKER_03]: Interesting.

730
00:49:48,811 --> 00:49:55,535
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, that was done by the way Nielsen Research and Perpetual Entertainment who are developing the upcoming PC MMO.

731
00:49:56,016 --> 00:49:57,056
[SPEAKER_03]: One other quick story for you guys.

732
00:49:57,096 --> 00:49:59,818
[SPEAKER_03]: Halo the movie has a rumored director attached.

733
00:49:59,918 --> 00:50:00,599
[SPEAKER_03]: Rumored, rumored.

734
00:50:01,940 --> 00:50:04,081
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to pronounce this name hideously wrong.

735
00:50:04,121 --> 00:50:04,422
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry.

736
00:50:04,742 --> 00:50:05,302
[SPEAKER_03]: Guillermo?

737
00:50:05,703 --> 00:50:06,123
[SPEAKER_03]: Guillermo?

738
00:50:06,203 --> 00:50:06,483
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

739
00:50:06,503 --> 00:50:13,428
[SPEAKER_03]: Guillermo del Toro who directed Hellboy is rumored to be the person that they are courting to get to do the Halo movie.

740
00:50:13,828 --> 00:50:17,451
[SPEAKER_03]: I think most people would just rather see Peter Jackson do it himself, but

741
00:50:18,723 --> 00:50:19,063
[SPEAKER_03]: Who knows?

742
00:50:19,123 --> 00:50:20,925
[SPEAKER_03]: After you guys see King Kong, you might feel differently.

743
00:50:20,945 --> 00:50:21,445
I don't know.

744
00:50:22,366 --> 00:50:22,727
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll see.

745
00:50:24,308 --> 00:50:25,289
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki, what else you got for us?

746
00:50:25,309 --> 00:50:26,570
[SPEAKER_05]: Didn't Peter Jackson also do Dead Alive?

747
00:50:27,190 --> 00:50:28,752
[SPEAKER_03]: He also did Meet the Feebles.

748
00:50:29,052 --> 00:50:29,653
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's not forget.

749
00:50:30,473 --> 00:50:31,814
[SPEAKER_03]: Any last stories you got, Loki?

750
00:50:31,934 --> 00:50:32,875
[SPEAKER_01]: Some real quick stuff.

751
00:50:33,316 --> 00:50:35,938
[SPEAKER_01]: The new Grand Theft Auto mod has just

752
00:50:36,647 --> 00:50:37,868
[SPEAKER_01]: Superjump, The Ability to Walk Through Walls

753
00:51:01,767 --> 00:51:03,548
[SPEAKER_01]: It's Half-Life 2 Survivor.

754
00:51:03,668 --> 00:51:06,530
[SPEAKER_01]: It's actually a first-person shooter for the arcade.

755
00:51:07,150 --> 00:51:09,732
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to have a card system to be able to save your progress.

756
00:51:09,952 --> 00:51:12,733
[SPEAKER_01]: Basically, the controls kind of look like a driving cabinet.

757
00:51:12,773 --> 00:51:17,856
[SPEAKER_01]: You have two controllers, one for looking, one for aiming, and then foot pedals for jumping and crouching.

758
00:51:17,916 --> 00:51:19,477
[SPEAKER_03]: So the grid, but way better.

759
00:51:19,957 --> 00:51:21,238
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, way better.

760
00:51:21,498 --> 00:51:23,679
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's kind of a really cool game.

761
00:51:24,180 --> 00:51:25,560
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought the grid was your favorite game.

762
00:51:26,341 --> 00:51:26,441
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

763
00:51:27,128 --> 00:51:35,594
[SPEAKER_01]: There's been also another kind of marketing campaign going on for the PSP, one featuring dust bunnies and a squirrel.

764
00:51:36,655 --> 00:51:37,996
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's really strange.

765
00:51:38,056 --> 00:51:41,759
[SPEAKER_01]: They describe the PSP as like a nut you can play with outside.

766
00:51:42,519 --> 00:51:46,122
[SPEAKER_01]: What's very interesting, though... There's no sense in... Oh, whatever.

767
00:51:46,182 --> 00:51:46,502
[SPEAKER_03]: Forget it.

768
00:51:46,562 --> 00:51:51,025
[SPEAKER_01]: What's very interesting, though, and this is actually... They've got...

769
00:51:51,889 --> 00:52:04,199
[SPEAKER_01]: These weird swirly things in the eyes that kind of look stoned, which also matches this new campaign that's going on, kind of a graffiti campaign, which you see kids basically hypnotized by the PSP.

770
00:52:04,899 --> 00:52:18,490
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, most people aren't liking this, and they're actually tagging over it and writing very colorful things like, I'll ride a Brompton bicycle or a teabag of mine before I give Sony Corp another fucking dime.

771
00:52:19,491 --> 00:52:19,591
[SPEAKER_01]: And

772
00:52:20,922 --> 00:52:24,725
[SPEAKER_03]: I like the part about the mime.

773
00:52:25,465 --> 00:52:27,387
[SPEAKER_03]: Because there's not enough mime violence in the world.

774
00:52:27,427 --> 00:52:28,467
[SPEAKER_01]: Not enough mime violence.

775
00:52:28,567 --> 00:52:30,689
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's basically popping up everywhere.

776
00:52:30,729 --> 00:52:34,551
[SPEAKER_01]: They've actually caught some of the artists responsible for it.

777
00:52:35,072 --> 00:52:35,792
[SPEAKER_01]: Pictures of them.

778
00:52:36,272 --> 00:52:39,374
[SPEAKER_01]: So another campaign that's not really welcome.

779
00:52:41,236 --> 00:52:42,016
[SPEAKER_01]: And finally...

780
00:52:43,868 --> 00:52:46,810
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope you enjoy that 360 for what you paid for They have so voided that warranty

781
00:53:13,513 --> 00:53:15,135
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, and that is it.

782
00:53:30,931 --> 00:53:34,812
[SPEAKER_03]: But using Google Maps to do it is playing Risk on Google Maps.

783
00:53:34,892 --> 00:53:39,634
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, if you wanted to check out this game, sorry, too bad, it's done.

784
00:53:40,114 --> 00:53:43,875
[SPEAKER_03]: It got ceased and desisted by Hasbro, who owns the right to Risk.

785
00:53:43,915 --> 00:53:50,397
[SPEAKER_03]: And did you know put out their own versions of Risk in 96 and 2000, I believe the goodbye message said.

786
00:53:51,077 --> 00:53:54,558
[SPEAKER_03]: Nevertheless, Hasbro none too happy that somebody is infringing on their trademark.

787
00:53:55,058 --> 00:54:02,186
[SPEAKER_03]: My suggestion to the authors, rename it World Conquest and make it similar but not the same.

788
00:54:03,127 --> 00:54:03,888
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, whatever.

789
00:54:04,228 --> 00:54:05,790
[SPEAKER_04]: Make it Nobody Can Take Russia.

790
00:54:07,705 --> 00:54:11,066
[SPEAKER_03]: or, you know, Google Maps will let you go anywhere.

791
00:54:11,146 --> 00:54:14,346
[SPEAKER_03]: So you could do, like, you know, Canadian Conquest.

792
00:54:15,006 --> 00:54:16,446
[SPEAKER_03]: Just choose Canada.

793
00:54:16,547 --> 00:54:18,887
[SPEAKER_03]: Or you could do L.A.

794
00:54:18,947 --> 00:54:19,647
[SPEAKER_03]: Conquest.

795
00:54:19,707 --> 00:54:20,947
[SPEAKER_03]: Just zoom in on L.A.

796
00:54:20,967 --> 00:54:21,807
[SPEAKER_03]: and do Risk.

797
00:54:21,967 --> 00:54:22,468
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, forget it.

798
00:54:22,988 --> 00:54:24,148
[SPEAKER_01]: Iowa Conquest.

799
00:54:24,248 --> 00:54:24,488
[SPEAKER_03]: What?

800
00:54:24,988 --> 00:54:25,928
[SPEAKER_01]: Iowa Conquest.

801
00:54:26,328 --> 00:54:26,668
[SPEAKER_03]: Iowa.

802
00:54:28,429 --> 00:54:29,449
[SPEAKER_01]: Delaware Conquest.

803
00:54:30,649 --> 00:54:32,449
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, we definitely have to end this show now.

804
00:54:32,509 --> 00:54:34,129
[SPEAKER_03]: So, Loki, what is your final thought?

805
00:54:34,710 --> 00:54:37,010
[SPEAKER_01]: My final thought is I'm going to play more games this week.

806
00:54:38,337 --> 00:54:43,020
[SPEAKER_03]: And my final thought would be, so am I. DarkSakura, your final thought.

807
00:54:44,061 --> 00:54:47,103
[SPEAKER_05]: Reject false icons, and I would like to be over the plague any minute now.

808
00:54:47,844 --> 00:54:48,184
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright.

809
00:54:48,684 --> 00:54:49,965
[SPEAKER_03]: Until next time, kids.

810
00:54:51,346 --> 00:54:53,708
[SPEAKER_03]: Which, by the way, did you know next week is episode number 50?

811
00:54:55,309 --> 00:54:55,809
[SPEAKER_03]: Good times.

812
00:54:55,989 --> 00:54:56,850
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll see you then.

813
00:54:58,971 --> 00:55:02,555
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the end of another Orange Lounge Radio To Go edition.

814
00:55:02,855 --> 00:55:08,361
[SPEAKER_00]: This podcast is a proud part of www.orangeloungeradio.com.
