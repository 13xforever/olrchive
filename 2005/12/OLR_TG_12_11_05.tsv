149	2611	Orange Lounge Radio To Go Edition, week of December 12th, 2005.
2832	13181	You're tuned in to the Orange Lounge Radio To Go Edition, your podcast home for all the latest video game news and gamer chat.
13422	16845	Now, here are your hosts, DarkSakura, Sky, and Loki.
18615	30012	Hello everybody once again and welcome to Orange Lounge Radio To Go, your home for discussion on video games, video game news, video game discussion about games that don't suck.
30473	34319	But sometimes we do have to talk about games that do suck just to tell you to avoid them.
34819	37781	Tonight is episode 50 of our podcast.
37961	38381	Yay.
39022	40743	It means 50 weeks in a row we've been here.
41303	42464	Podcasting is that new.
42924	46807	It's only been around like a little bit in a year, you know, so it's kind of cool.
47947	50389	So we're just a couple weeks from our one year anniversary, of course, that means.
51730	54892	With me, as always, is the one and only Dark Sakura.
55452	55772	Hi.
56152	56573	How you doing?
57673	58994	My voice keeps coming and going.
59755	61636	You still have the plague.
61676	62036	Plaguey.
63536	64597	I do still have the plague.
64637	69779	It sucks because I've learned that lung cookies really are not a delicacy.
70960	71340	I see.
72741	74702	Also with us, say hello to the one and only Loki.
74922	75322	Hello.
75482	76062	How are you doing?
76763	77643	I'm quite stuffed up.
78304	79985	And I'm also sick, so you know what that means.
80225	82906	All three of us are sick.
82926	85047	I don't think we all have the plague, but we all have something bad.
85067	85527	I have the plague.
86128	86308	I know.
86588	86948	It's horrible.
86968	88569	We had to cancel our live show this week.
88649	90030	I think you both have the microplague.
90370	90710	Maybe.
91030	91611	Mini-plague.
91731	92211	Mini-plague.
93052	94614	I shall call it mini-plague.
95054	97076	I don't know, but it sucks.
98757	100359	We weren't going to call in sick for episode 50.
100659	104542	This would happen to us on a landmark-style show to us.
106164	108065	Anyway, let's get into it.
108285	109446	Same schtick as always.
109867	112149	What kind of stuff have you been playing this week, DarkSakura?
113410	114211	Animal Crossing.
115632	119095	I've been playing with my villagers and hitting you in the head with a net.
120391	122952	and hitting people I don't know in your village with a net.
123753	125474	And I stubbed you in the toe with my shovel.
125954	128115	And you also planted a pitfall that I fell into, thank you.
128695	133257	I planted one for myself so that I could fall into it right in front of you to make you feel better.
133658	138520	But you got out of it before I was able to get my bug net out and start whacking you while you were in the hole, so it made me sad.
139741	140001	Sorry.
140461	143042	This is me giving you a flat look that our listeners can't hear.
144423	145023	Great radio.
145644	145904	I, uh...
147077	164650	I also have been watching Dan play a lot of that game that I'm getting really bored of watching, the Project Gotham Racing 3, because it looks like the cars are still floating over the ground, and that's all I hear is, Crash!
166391	166811	Shit!
168673	169153	No!
169233	169874	Don't go that way!
171635	175858	Of course, I also hear the same thing while he's playing Need for Speed Underground on the Xbox.
176829	189092	I've been playing Animal Crossing, which is fun, and I've been playing a little bit Need for Speed, or not Need for Speed, Average Racer 6, because that's cool.
191093	191813	I've been playing...
204787	208871	Also, very, very little of Project Gotham because I kind of suck at the game.
209371	209851	Amp 3.
209972	210912	Amp 3 is really fun.
212234	218599	Yes, and I finally got my 360 because I had to go buy it from somebody who was charging an exorbitant amount of money for it.
219940	220340	But you know what?
220381	220901	I'm satisfied.
221882	222362	Shame!
223163	223683	You know what?
224184	225545	It's all Microsoft's fault.
225805	227667	Our listeners can't see me pointing and laughing.
228848	229348	I don't know.
229388	230589	You let me down, Loki.
230709	232331	No, it's... You know...
233390	233650	DarkSakura,
264690	265070	That is it.
265431	265671	Two.
268693	271395	At that rate, my 360 would arrive in February.
273677	278000	So now, didn't you get a tip that a bunch of Best Buys are getting a bunch more 360s on a particular day?
278020	279101	Yeah, I don't want to wait in line.
279802	281983	I don't want to wait early in the morning in line for this stuff.
282003	284145	Well, what about our listeners who might want to know the tip?
286046	292271	Well, there's going to be a lot of 360s arriving at Best Buy for their December 18th sale.
292671	293452	They're going to have
294016	295277	At least 20 per store.
296458	297659	Some a lot more than that.
298400	302063	And you can actually find... There's a whole list I posted in my live journal.
302303	303744	Where did you figure this out?
303784	305826	Because the list you got looked really official.
305966	307187	It's on GameFAQs.
308328	312051	Someone had posted a list that I guess is off of a printout or something.
312091	317195	But anyways, basically most of the stores like an R. We're getting 24 per store.
317295	319717	One of them was getting 30 or 40, I think.
319917	322019	But that's about it.
322099	322660	Yeah, so...
323575	325758	If you want one, you better be waiting in line again.
325798	327540	It's like the launch all over again.
327840	335529	Which I find funny because Best Buy is getting, what, like, tons of these 360s and GameStop is getting two.
337191	337671	What the hell?
338813	342457	Well, that's because for every Best Buy there's like 20 GameStops, at least in this area.
343578	344278	It's ridiculous.
344378	347859	But anyways, the whole thing is just, it's a big rip-off.
347899	354081	And before you go and buy your 360, take a good look at what accessories you need and how much those are going to cost.
354561	355361	Let me tell you this much.
356442	362923	I ended up using my entire pre-order amount of money on the 360 that I had on there.
363303	364464	$430 on accessories.
365144	367345	That is how much their fucking accessories cost.
368525	371886	Okay, those controllers, $50 each for the wireless ones.
372086	372266	Those
372628	375889	You know, component cables, try $40 for stupid cables.
375989	377530	I mean, it's ridiculous.
377850	379631	And if you get a core system, good luck.
380711	391175	I do understand that someone went into, I think it was at my husband's store, and dropped three grand on his Platinum 360 with controllers and games.
393616	393816	Wow.
394955	396376	I don't feel sorry for them one bit.
397057	402622	For them losing, oh, poor things losing $140 per system they sell.
403023	405085	Oh, don't fucking care, okay?
406846	408788	I mean, even, I had to get a core system.
408868	409589	This is the one I got.
410310	412392	And it has composite cables with it.
412732	414654	The composite cables only have S-video on them.
414694	416415	You have to buy separate cables, which are $30.
416796	419278	Way more than any other cables I've seen.
419839	420179	But, uh,
424822	438095	I don't think you need anything better than Composite unless you're running an HDTV or like a computer monitor or something.
438616	442680	The only thing that you will run into is that text is hard to read if you don't have S-Video or something like that.
444022	444342	That's it.
445433	447054	So what are your impressions of Xbox 360?
447254	449314	Is it worth all the money you poured into it?
449875	458138	Well, yeah, because I'm going to use it a lot here and with my job at work and stuff, so it is worth it in that sense.
458618	459978	And I was going to pick it up at some point.
460399	462959	I mean, other people have done the same, you know, they spent money on it.
463680	468041	And I just, I don't see, I had like six games waiting for the system.
468121	471783	I just didn't want to wait another two months to be able to not play these games or whatever.
472663	474843	But so far, you know, I like it.
475044	475704	It's pretty fun.
475944	480305	It's definitely a pretty good game system.
480325	487546	Project Gotham, though, is more like Gran Turismo than me, and I don't really like Gran Turismo, but it is still pretty, you know, it's a nice game.
488226	489447	But I don't know.
489607	497468	I'm hoping that most of these games that come out, because I haven't played a lot of the games yet, aren't just all pretty graphics and horrible gameplay.
498348	500409	Did you get a chance to play Perfect Dark Zero yet?
500749	501069	Not yet.
501459	501919	Project Gotham
524060	525081	But, um, I don't know.
525541	530245	It just seemed like all it was was stuff that the Xbox could do, but now supporting HDTV.
530285	535049	And I'm thinking, you know, if this, you know, I'm lucky to have a 30-something inch HDTV.
535549	539993	If I didn't have that, I don't think the game would look that much better than the regular Xbox.
540173	544717	So, or a computer monitor or something else to hook it up to that can support the higher-end textures.
545177	545758	So, I don't know.
546118	546798	I'm not sure I...
547739	549041	Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter
567813	569555	I kind of think at this point they should have just waited.
570776	571276	They should have.
571697	575220	I understand why they were trying to rush for Christmas.
575240	580584	They have become the talked about item for Christmas, which is what they wanted, but at what price?
580945	586510	I think they've really fucked up this whole launch, and a lot of people are definitely pissed off at them.
586910	593076	Granted, some people are going to care and they're still going to get their 360, but some of them are saying, fuck this, I'm going to wait for the PS3.
593896	617952	and I mean even if that is a small percentage that's still your core customers you're losing because you chose to do this I don't know don't you think though that with the right game those people would come back to play Devil's Advocate a little bit don't you think with the right game coming out in the future you know especially you know what is what is it the Xbox 360 lacks right now role-playing games right let's say that you know with with all these developments that some of the folks that were working for Square going over to make games for the 360 starting their own company
618254	624099	When some of these games come out, that's going to make the 360 a hell of a lot more desirable no matter how bad their launch was.
625000	628643	All the pencils coming out for the PS3 and all that stuff too.
629124	645018	Microsoft did get support from Sega, Tetsuya Mizuguchi, Sakaguchi, Okamoto, all the big guys that were with Square, Capcom.
645778	649041	Yeah, so it's interesting to see what's going to be coming up in the future.
649142	649442	I don't know.
649842	656809	I just think, although this launch might be screwy, and people are talking shit now, I think people are going to overlook it in a year.
657269	663255	But you're right, it really depends on the strength of the PS3, but hopefully Sony's taking notes and they'll have enough chips when they're ready to go.
663795	668199	Well, hopefully it comes down to, let's not all launch, the worldwide launch was dumb.
668860	669641	It was really dumb.
671240	673001	And they didn't truly launch worldwide.
673041	674522	They launched in three major markets.
674902	675662	The three biggest markets.
675742	678044	You split up your systems and you have shortages in three countries.
678484	679525	I don't call that worldwide launch.
679565	681066	I call that, oh, I shipped somebody.
681126	682026	It's someplace else.
682046	683367	Yeah, good point.
683887	687109	All right, anyway, as far as other games I played this week, of course, Animal Crossing is big news.
687350	688770	And I've checked out Animal Crossing.
689371	691892	It's very similar to the GameCube version.
692133	694034	I kind of call it Animal Crossing Plus.
694912	695412	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
712788	721490	It does, but that's okay because... The land is different, but it makes it nice, makes it that seamless feeling to it.
721790	726211	It sounds like the objectives take longer, and of course the Wi-Fi is pretty cool.
726871	728092	The first couple days were rough.
728132	733493	I was getting a lot of communication errors those first two days, but it's calmed down a lot, and I've had a lot of people in and out of my village.
733793	734193	What can I say?
734213	737354	I'm an Animal Crossing whore.
737954	739354	Overall, the experience has been pretty good.
739434	741475	Sometimes it can be really slow that...
742318	743258	Wifi stuff.
743318	749741	Not that you get lagged, but that when somebody comes into your village, save, wait, here they come, save.
750001	753903	It's a pretty slow process, but overall, can't complain.
754283	760206	It certainly adds so much more to the game where you don't have to be taking a physical memory card over to somebody else's house.
760706	765208	If you enjoyed Animal Crossing on the GameCube, you will enjoy this on the DS.
765768	769810	I think you'll kind of find that you're kind of rediscovering what you liked about Animal Crossing 1 all over again.
769850	771131	My fear about this game
771591	775332	is that it's going to be another Nintendogs that in two weeks none of us will be playing it anymore.
776213	777373	After we all pay off our houses.
777413	778613	That was the problem with Animal Crossing 1.
778914	780534	After everybody paid off their house, oh, bye game.
781634	782835	And I don't know.
784876	786416	It's typical to say at this point.
786676	790638	And it's also, you know, not trying to collect all the retro Nintendo games anymore.
790658	791698	Yeah, you don't have that anymore.
791718	793779	I know people who still tend to their GameCube houses.
794539	796820	I know, and there's always going to be... There's also babysitting my village.
797080	800701	There's going to be the hardcore, you know, people, but for the average gamer...
801477	803418	I think they're going to move on after a couple weeks.
803698	806078	I just have this bad feeling it's going to be another Nintendogs.
806598	806879	I don't know.
806919	809659	I think it'll last longer than Nintendogs because I think there's more to do.
810279	812320	But I just, I don't know.
812340	816621	I don't see this thrill lasting, especially with, you know, games that are going to be coming out in January, February.
817061	818702	I think this was a good time for the game to come out.
819902	820802	But I don't know.
820822	823083	I just don't see the honeymoon lasting forever with Animal Crossing.
823835	833035	I think it's going to stick around for a little while we'll see ever since I got Animal Crossing I haven't touched Mario Kart I'll probably go back to that though anyway
834116	834236	XBOX 360
854813	855654	DarkSakura, DarkSakura.com
876829	880955	There, of course, Microsoft is not calling this a failure yet in Japan.
881055	887724	I think a lot of, you know, you can really tell who the MS fanboys and the anti-MS fanboys are because, you know, I'm sure the anti-Microsoft...
890525	891246	My mic went out again.
891366	895168	The anti-Microsoft people are quick to jump on this and say, oh, they failed.
895608	896948	Xbox 360 failed in Japan.
897709	898209	I don't know.
899590	902231	I've been pretty critical of Microsoft in the past.
902812	903212	Stupid mic.
903512	909015	I've been pretty critical of Microsoft in the past, but I don't say just because they had a slower launch, don't count them out.
909395	912777	Again, we were just talking about, you know, the big games are going to be coming out.
913726	920030	Later next year, and what are the games that Japanese gamers really want that aren't out on the Xbox 360 at all right now?
920431	921331	Enchanted Arm.
922152	923273	RPGs in general.
923453	925094	And I'm sorry, Cameo does not count.
925614	926235	It's a platformer.
926455	926655	Yeah.
927035	930017	So, don't count it out in Japan yet.
930117	935721	Wait and see what happens when the dudes from Final Fantasy put out their game on the Xbox 360 or whatever it is they're planning.
936021	937482	Wait and see how that does or doesn't do.
938043	939864	That's the true indication of how the system's going to do.
940224	940544	I think.
941405	942946	Jamie, you have kind of a follow-up on that?
943769	967725	Well, yeah, just a lot of the market analysts in Japan are really, really down on it, saying that... In fact, there's a quote on here saying that they previously thought the Xbox 360 would gain a major share of Japanese market by taking some of the share from Sony, but now that prospect might not be realized given the limited attractiveness of its titles and lukewarm functions.
967765	969946	That last part's a direct quote.
970186	970707	However...
971958	983568	CESA survey at the Tokyo Game Show was saying that 23% of the consumers want an Xbox 360 compared to under 21% interested in the Revolution.
995851	1007577	But see, the thing that gets me is that all these analysts are talking about, oh, PlayStation 3, PlayStation 3, they're comparing, they're basically comparing what exists to what might exist.
1007837	1021424	I mean, we've seen the demo, the tech, I'm sure all of us will, saw a lot of the demo stuff, you know, that's out on the internet now for the PlayStation 3, and I went and did that pretty little show they had at E3, but honestly...
1022970	1024731	Don't count your chickens before they're hatched.
1025132	1033238	Same with Nintendo because Nintendo is, you know, they're taking what's always been oranges and making apples now.
1033699	1034759	At least it's what they say.
1034780	1039063	You know, the revolution and everything is going to be not literally making apples.
1039123	1040244	We don't know that they've teamed up yet.
1040264	1045948	But, you know, it's certainly interesting because Nintendo, it almost sounds like, wants to go off in this entire other direction.
1045968	1047330	They're like, you know, screw specs.
1047670	1048551	We've got something better.
1049671	1049972	I don't know.
1051473	1051553	Ugh.
1051900	1057742	I glanced over an article a few days ago where MTV got their hands on a revolution to try it out.
1057762	1059903	I don't remember them being overly excited.
1059923	1061584	Oh, I'm sure they gave the revolution the plague.
1063325	1067006	Loki, you have some more information about some interesting developments on the revolution?
1067066	1068847	Some type of patent or something going on there?
1068887	1075370	Yeah, the revolution, they've got basically these patents for... It's two patents for displacement mapping.
1075390	1079392	It's basically a technique used to kind of ease...
1080962	1104357	rendering 3D and 2D and what they've done is the first patent is actually about the displacement mapping itself, the actual rendering and the second is on a technique that uses basically less of the CPU to render the stuff to make basically their less powerful system just as powerful is basically what it is.
1105143	1111690	So my big question is, does this support your theory that the revolution, your ongoing theory throughout our past few episodes that the revolution is 3D?
1112251	1114373	I can't even think of the term now.
1114954	1115615	Stereoscopic 3D.
1115635	1116215	Yes, thank you.
1116235	1118638	Stereoscopic 3D.
1118958	1120240	It doesn't really add to anything.
1120440	1123083	It's basically saying that it can render stuff a lot faster.
1123649	1124049	Interesting.
1125030	1125351	We'll see.
1126031	1127393	I have some news over on PlayStation 3.
1128674	1135100	People are saying that there's no way in hell PlayStation 3 is going to launch in spring, and Sony reassured this week, yes, they will.
1135140	1137182	They will be releasing in the spring.
1138163	1139224	Maybe not in the U.S., though.
1140525	1143347	But they will release in the spring, at least in Japan.
1143987	1144967	Very interesting.
1147048	1150290	It seems like there's this huge still kind of question mark with the PlayStation 3.
1150670	1152211	You know, there's still a lot about it we don't know.
1152291	1154532	And spring is not that far away.
1154652	1157494	So it'll be interesting if this machine really does launch in the spring.
1158554	1160675	But, you know, I'd like to see it.
1162356	1162816	Be interesting.
1163537	1167119	You know, it's going to be sort of like I think the PS2 was.
1169008	1172913	Be released, be buggy as hell, be re-released.
1173113	1179021	Although amazingly enough, I actually have a very first model Japanese PS2 which has never had a problem.
1179853	1182075	You would think, too, that they learned from their previous mistakes.
1182415	1182896	You'd hope.
1183596	1186819	And that they're looking at what's going on with Microsoft and maybe saying, how can we prevent this?
1186959	1187540	At least I hope.
1188180	1189141	I hope everybody's looking at this.
1189341	1191763	Unless they put more work into it than they've been vocal about.
1192624	1192984	We'll see.
1193585	1200190	Speaking of 360, Loki, you had a story about basically Microsoft has come out and admitted why.
1200891	1204474	Well, the 360 supposedly is short, according to Microsoft, is because
1205123	1218291	of a shortage of chips, or a certain chip that was actually needed for the 360, and because the production of this chip is not quite at what they want, the 360s haven't been able to be made.
1219112	1224675	Basically, the yields are too low, and they're overrunning the supply of the systems.
1226856	1234621	And what they've said, though, is they're not going to be able to get back up to where they need to be until February.
1236311	1239593	Which is another reason why I bought my system when I could.
1239613	1242515	So basically if you don't have a pre-order, don't count on it until February.
1243076	1244537	Unless you're going to be camping out or something.
1244917	1246398	It's going to be very hard to get one.
1248860	1253843	Speaking of the 360, their backwards compatibility has been upgraded a little bit.
1253903	1256765	They actually added support for a bunch of new games.
1257205	1259126	Except they all fall in the same family.
1259346	1270970	If you own any Tom Clancy game from the Xbox, pretty much, whether it be Ghost Recon 2, Summit Strike, Rainbow Six, Splinter Cell, it all now will work on your Xbox 360, thanks to backward compatibility.
1271010	1274412	Yeah, what's funny is when they initially released this, it broke Halo 2.
1274452	1278233	Then they had to recall the patch, and then they fixed it.
1278493	1279354	Oh, I didn't know about that.
1279574	1280274	Yeah, that was funny.
1280494	1281875	We were playing Halo on our 360.
1282155	1284136	I was actually watching Dan play it.
1284176	1285056	Does it really look better?
1286662	1287322	Not noticeably.
1288183	1290583	A little cleaner.
1292164	1297706	We played it on the Xbox plenty of times that I'm pretty familiar with what it looks like on my TV.
1298506	1307249	And it did look a little more smooth, but it really wasn't a perceptible notice unless you were really looking for it.
1309326	1309626	All right.
1310747	1317931	Let's go ahead and move on now and talk a little bit about real life because there is a big world out there outside of video games.
1318331	1325495	And, you know, if we stayed indoors and played video games all day long, we would have no time to go outside and whack people over the head with bug nets for real.
1326035	1331918	So DarkSakura is here to remind you that there is a big world out there, and she brings you her advice column.
1332619	1334760	DarkSakura, what are you going to be telling the kids about this week?
1335478	1338961	Today's bit of advice is how to survive if you're trapped in a walk-in freezer.
1340602	1342663	Wait, wasn't that an episode of Clerks, the cartoon?
1342843	1343344	Yes, it was.
1343464	1343984	Oh, awesome.
1344565	1348928	Where it had Dante wearing the diaper saying, I'm the biggest dumbass in the world.
1351049	1355352	Anyway, number one, tap several times on the door to get someone's attention.
1356153	1357894	Two, check the door and lock area.
1361091	1364995	By law, all walk-in freezers must have an emergency release switch on the interior.
1366136	1364995	3.
1366536	1367497	Locate a power switch.
1367537	1369639	Some units may have an accessible on-off switch.
1370099	1371380	Turn off the cooling element.
1372401	1373362	That would be gross.
1373842	1375203	What if you're in there with meat?
1376565	1379587	Then turn it on every now and then to keep it nice and cool, but not too cold.
1379767	1380948	You'd come out smelling like meat.
1381549	1382450	Like rancid.
1383330	1382450	4.
1383591	1384511	Locate boxes.
1384972	1387234	Tear cardboard boxes apart and spread them on the floor.
1388560	1390622	5.
1388981	1390622	Look for insulating materials.
1390702	1395545	Lie down on the cardboard and cover yourself with paper foam or straw to preserve vitality.
1395565	1395545	6.
1395585	1397627	Tap on the door every 15 minutes until help arrives.
1414488	1418249	And actually in the little picture it shows somebody sitting there with an open container of ice cream and a spoon.
1419589	1425730	But my final piece of advice is, you know, just leave the door open.
1427151	1429811	When you're cleaning out your freezer at the 7-Eleven, just leave the door open.
1430711	1435652	And if you're in the freezer at the 7-Eleven, you could probably get out through where they have the drinks or something.
1436913	1438273	Do a swan dive through the eggs.
1440794	1441174	Wow.
1441294	1442634	Okay, moving on.
1444090	1445411	We have a nice follow-up story.
1445431	1459779	You remember a couple weeks ago on the show here, we had Matt from the Save King's Quest 9 campaign was on the show to talk about how King's Quest 9 had a stop put to it by the man, basically, at Vivendi, and they were doing this huge letter-writing campaign to get it going again?
1459899	1460519	Well, guess what?
1460980	1461200	They...
1461940	1463062	Thanks for watching!
1478843	1482066	They will be releasing the game simply as a silver lining.
1482146	1484848	However, all the King's Quest characters get to stay intact.
1485348	1490892	Presumably the reason why Vivendi would be asking them to drop the name would be in case, you know, they see that this thing does really well.
1490932	1493694	Maybe they'll want to go, maybe we really should put out a King's Quest.
1493734	1495776	Maybe we made a bad decision.
1496116	1496596	Yeah, you did.
1496977	1499038	But, kind of cool.
1499098	1502200	I mean, you kind of have to applaud Vivendi here.
1502261	1505523	They were, you know, looked at as the big evil man and here they are doing the,
1506175	1508277	Think if they really wanted to do the big thing, then hire them to make it.
1521292	1521752	You'd think so.
1521992	1525574	Maybe it depends on how well this does, because it's supposedly going to be part of a trilogy.
1525875	1527796	This silver lining thing is all part of a trilogy.
1527816	1530417	They're going the whole nine yards with this thing.
1530817	1531438	No pun intended.
1531658	1532158	We shall see.
1532178	1532618	All right.
1532638	1533159	It'll be fun.
1533179	1533739	I'll download it.
1533759	1534239	I'll check it out.
1534819	1535660	I hope Rosella's in it.
1535700	1539322	Instead of calling it King's Quest, it could be like King's Look Around.
1540202	1540903	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1569793	1572734	There's a little teaser trailer thing posted on the site.
1573415	1574855	It's very sexy, I gotta say.
1574935	1576676	It's just like trailers for the game.
1577076	1580718	And Pyramid Head you can see for like .5 seconds.
1581178	1583319	So it's very cool because they're advertising the movie like it's a game.
1584199	1585339	I gotta put this out there.
1585380	1586600	It's not a real trailer.
1586680	1588521	It's the Flash animation from the site.
1589061	1593163	But presumably, if the real trailer looks like that, it's gonna be sexy.
1593922	1594962	We have high hopes for this game.
1594982	1595682	Do not disappoint us.
1595982	1598043	However, one minor disappointment this week.
1598163	1599303	I think this is a disappointment.
1599923	1605184	It was reported that Akira Yamaoka will not actually be doing the music for the Silent Hill movie.
1605244	1606564	He did the music for the games.
1606945	1608305	He will not be doing the music for the movie.
1608605	1612526	That honor will go to Jeff Dana, who did the music for Resident Evil Apocalypse.
1612986	1617507	However, he has said... I know Jamie wants to get something in there because she's mad.
1618047	1619787	However, I do want to say that he said...
1620007	1627854	The executive producer, Andrew Mason, said that Jeff Dana will be incorporating elements from the original game's score into the movie's score.
1628014	1628815	So at least you get that.
1629015	1629776	That's what I was going to say.
1630276	1631297	Oh, okay.
1631597	1635020	I've been, like, every day looking at Silent Hill stuff.
1635401	1639484	I would still at least like to see Akira get to do, like, a vocal song or something.
1639504	1642247	You know, because he did such great songs for the games that could have been...
1643237	1648742	I don't think they would have ever been a runaway MTV hit, but I think they could have really appealed to the audience that would go see Silent Hill.
1649102	1654387	You know, the songs like You're Not Here from 3 and, you know, stuff from 4 like Room of Angel.
1654407	1658091	I'm really hoping this breaks the pattern of movie game.
1658111	1659352	I hope so too.
1659492	1662375	It looks pretty dead on so far.
1662955	1665157	If that Flash trailer is anything, that was...
1666676	1667697	Exactly how it should be.
1667917	1668437	Exactly.
1670038	1672000	I'd play it for you guys, but we're a radio show.
1672180	1673601	Just go to the site and check it out.
1674101	1678965	Well, I actually don't have the link on me because it's on my home computer.
1679745	1688031	But I had seen a site that had a bit more information as far as the characters in it.
1688091	1693015	There are at least mentions to characters that are in...
1694488	1695829	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1716049	1717610	One other video game news thing though
1743421	1755649	Even when you consider that Doom did not do too hot at the box office, it made $49 million worldwide on a $60 million budget, they are going to do a return to Castle Wolfenstein movie.
1755689	1758451	At least that's what ID Software wants to do.
1759071	1769758	Nobody has, I don't think, bought this yet, but they want to do it, a movie for return to Castle Wolfenstein, which you might know is, in some ways, the predecessor to Doom is
1771081	1772582	If you go as far back as Wolfenstein 3D.
1772602	1774583	Just don't do the first person crap.
1775463	1775984	They better not.
1778125	1779785	I actually did find that information, by the way.
1779925	1780146	Yes.
1783007	1784628	Actually, I found it on Wikipedia.
1784668	1785468	That's where I had seen it.
1785969	1793212	There's a character in the movie called Christabella who, if I remember correctly, was also a character in the comic series.
1794173	1800096	Several of the people, the main character, Rose, her last name is Mason, which was Heather...
1801252	1807341	Cheryl Mason, and Harry Mason, and there's also a Sharon Mason in this.
1808503	1814953	And also, I think another character in here relates to another character that had been in Silent Hill 3.
1815356	1816256	Animal Crossing DS Animal Crossing DS
1838307	1838867	WTF?
1839068	1840328	Yeah, I saw that last night.
1841229	1842909	I did not do the K.K.
1842950	1846051	Slider thing because he comes to your town, what, Saturday night?
1846131	1850353	Saturday night between 7.30 to 8 is his warm-up, 8 to midnight is the show.
1850533	1854715	I usually go out clubbing Saturday nights, but not last night.
1854735	1855216	I was coughing.
1855676	1856896	But anyway, no, this is interesting.
1857197	1858017	Part of what K.K.
1858037	1864340	Slider says in his little introduction, those industry fat cats try to put a price on my music, but it wants to be free.
1865361	1865761	I don't know.
1866488	1868449	I think somebody might be taking that a little too far.
1868469	1873032	I don't know if I'd see that as a slam against the RIAA, but... That was the first impression I got.
1873092	1874333	He said a little bit more than that.
1875274	1875614	I don't know.
1875674	1878276	I just kind of got the sense that it fits into his character.
1878296	1881778	Because, you know, he's supposed to be this wandering nomad guy that just plays tunes.
1881798	1885660	Well, he gives you bootleg copies of his songs, so... I don't know.
1885920	1887461	I think people might be taking that a little far.
1887501	1887882	I don't know if...
1888542	1893246	I think it would not be in Nintendo's best interest to speak out against the RIAA, but who knows?
1893486	1899210	The bit if Nintendo was actually really worried about putting that impression, they would have phrased that line a little differently.
1899671	1900311	I guess you got a point.
1900992	1901172	True.
1902753	1911040	Now, I've got to ask about this, because we've been talking about a lot of new consoles here tonight, but I want to hear about an old console, and Loki, you have some pretty exciting news regarding an old console.
1911340	1917485	Yeah, Sega is apparently, well, it's a rumor, of course, but some German gaming site, Gamefront...
1918861	1922822	is claiming that they're going to be re-releasing the Dreamcast.
1922902	1927564	Basically it's bundled with some limited edition phone card or something.
1928484	1936527	But it's supposed to probably only be released in Japan and distributed through Sega Direct for about $83 US or 10,000 yen.
1936627	1941768	Or you could just go to GameStop and get a used one for like 30 bucks.
1942588	1943529	However much they're running.
1944449	1945849	I know, it's still a neat idea.
1946590	1947730	I still play my Dreamcast.
1948243	1949084	Dead or Alive 4 Dead or Alive 4
1976823	1977984	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2000819	2002060	Other than that, normal consoles, we have 25 to Life,
2028184	2034146	Final Fantasy IV Advance on the 13th.
2034166	2035147	I found that one out.
2036387	2036807	The hard way.
2037528	2039308	Final Fantasy IV on the 13th of January?
2039748	2040349	No, of December.
2040789	2041089	This week.
2041549	2042889	Yes, yes, that's this week.
2043550	2049772	And then, of course, True Swing Golf, if you're a golf fan for the DS, that's pretty good.
2051348	2053289	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2080529	2082830	Bioshock, Call of Cthulhu, Dead to Rights.
2084350	2085810	A few titles along those lines.
2085951	2094593	Now, just out of this morbid curiosity, do they have to alter Madden NFL when they release it in Britain because football is not football there?
2094853	2097654	It's, as far as I was aware, it's just called American football.
2098754	2101375	I don't know if that means they've got to recode stuff in the game or whatever.
2101395	2104896	No, it's just called NFL, so it would be the National Football League.
2105176	2106856	Just curious, just one of my curiosity things.
2107016	2108717	I was going to mention one thing since we're talking about the UK.
2110189	2114773	The official Xbox 360 magazine is going to be on the January issue.
2114793	2119076	It's going to have a disc to be able to play the Final Fantasy XI beta on the 360.
2120197	2121077	Here or in the UK?
2121338	2121918	I think in the UK.
2121938	2124100	I'm not sure about here, but maybe.
2125160	2126001	So check that out.
2127022	2129163	Well, lucky you guys if you guys get that and America doesn't.
2129924	2135408	Another actually interesting game on here is Shin Megami Tensei, which we actually got over here.
2135628	2136609	Yeah, digital double-sided.
2137659	2140239	Oh, actually, we didn't get a number of...
2165660	2166601	Listen up, this is great.
2166661	2167341	Listen to this.
2167381	2167961	By Gareth.
2194839	2197620	Hey guys, was listening to your show on the way to work today.
2198140	2199981	I live just outside London, UK by the way.
2200081	2206963	I have a 2.75 year old daughter, which piqued my interest in your chat about parents' responsibility with their kids.
2207423	2215765	So my daughter and I play games together, mostly things like Trackmania Sunrise, she likes painting the cars, to Incredibles to Super Mario Sunshine.
2216266	2220747	She also has some kids games like Dora the Explorer along with some web games on the BBC.
2221727	2223728	So my point, I was surprised at two things.
2224268	2227150	One, it is hard to get games that don't feature some sort of violence.
2227230	2230571	We are by nature a society that violence has a part of it.
2231612	2237735	Two, she was very quick to pick up on the violent parts of games and knows when she is hitting someone or something.
2238075	2241237	She even vocalizes it by saying hit or shoot when she does this.
2241837	2244598	After being a bit worried about this, I thought this is not a problem.
2244938	2250281	She has parents who monitor and guide her behavior and we have not seen her try to replicate the violence she has seen on the game so far.
2251144	2260268	I know from my experience as a long-time gamer and now a parent, that is my parents' guidance and active parenting that made the biggest difference to me being well-adjusted.
2260328	2261128	Well, some think so.
2262128	2269551	You won't be able to change your kids' environments and their exposure to violence that easily, but you definitely can be a big influence in how they react and live with it.
2269711	2274433	And I thought that last phrase right there was the best way anyone could ever say it.
2274513	2276054	You have major kudos from me.
2276772	2277413	Beautifully put.
2278734	2279134	That's right.
2279354	2280476	Can you get it through one more email?
2280816	2281797	I can get through a couple.
2282057	2283118	All right, cool.
2284639	2289384	Also, got an email from Deekman, one of our Australian listeners.
2289404	2291106	Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
2291566	2293988	Talking about the 50 Cent game.
2294449	2294749	50 Cent.
2295009	2295590	Oh, God.
2296631	2297131	Oh, my God.
2297171	2298513	I watched like five minutes of the...
2299827	2311241	The BikeTV Video Game Awards, and I saw a little bit of that 50 Cent game, and I was just like, this is so not the type of game that appeals to me in any way, shape, or form.
2311681	2317268	Well, you said the 50 Cent game had been banned in Australia for drug use and excessive violence.
2317448	2318950	And for sucking really bad.
2319602	2320082	DarkSakura.com
2333260	2334561	Horrible reviews.
2334901	2336042	Horrible reviews.
2336182	2336642	Really?
2337583	2338203	That's too bad.
2339104	2346269	Well, as I was reading, to quote, down here if a game gets an R rating, it literally can't be sold in stores.
2346349	2353414	Other titles include the original GTA 3 game where you could pick up hookers and screw them to get back life, which was edited out and re-released, and Manhunt.
2354294	2359738	In cases like this, you guys are lucky that your stuff only gets censored as much as they do and not completely banned from stores like our stuff.
2361010	2366774	Oh, and he also mentioned that Acclaim is bankrupt and now selling off rights to games so we could get the rights to Busted Move if we wanted it.
2367374	2368135	Oh, yeah, that's right.
2368455	2371657	I did a story on my live show on the station this week about that.
2371677	2380483	That's kind of interesting, and I thought it was interesting because only one of the Mary Kay and Ashley Wilson games is being bought, sought after, out of the, like, 50 that were available.
2381123	2384826	There was another point made by one of our listeners in Scotland.
2385558	2387961	I've been getting a lot of overseas writing these days.
2387981	2388842	I think it's pretty cool.
2388922	2389984	Yeah, that's neat.
2390104	2390965	From Sloan.
2393588	2395571	Said he's got three kids, 33, and...
2404588	2407329	Part of the course is to discover your market when designing a game.
2407349	2411472	You come up with an overall concept and test the market to see who your primary persona is.
2412012	2421298	They mentioned a site that's DESA.com, the Entertainment Software Association, that has a report called Essential Facts About the Computer and Video Game Industry.
2422139	2424220	It says it has some interesting statistics.
2426481	2427682	for statistics.
2428523	2431144	For example, the average age of a game buyer is 37.
2432805	2437769	So it's really the parents that are buying the games, the older sibling buying the games.
2438469	2442011	And most of the time, it's the kid saying, hey, I want this game.
2442131	2444133	Or the parent saying, hey, kid, do you want this game?
2444173	2447055	And the kid going, sure, I'd like the suffering.
2449156	2452138	And yes, I've actually seen this happen just recently.
2453084	2455086	at one of our local video game stores.
2455186	2456347	So I know very well.
2456827	2460790	But to quote, I'm going to read this one's paragraph here I think is very important.
2461250	2462612	Parents need to be educated.
2462672	2468096	You wouldn't take your kid to an 18 certificate movie or would you?
2468416	2474741	My son, the 11 year old, has a friend whose parents regularly let him watch horror movies and play video games such as GTA and Doom 3.
2475442	2477163	There's a lack of parental instruction here.
2478374	2487523	I've got what my children see when they are in my sight, but what are the other parents exposing my child to when they visit their friends' friends?
2488724	2496151	And he also goes on further and says, by age he means the kid is mature enough when you're 11 you laugh at dick and fart jokes and naked women, but that's not particularly mature.
2496392	2497112	I'm still doing that at 27.
2497192	2497673	We still tell them.
2501756	2504997	But, you know, I thought this was pretty smart.
2505457	2508438	Make the law similar to DVD video and liquor sales.
2508498	2511899	If you supply to an underage person, you can be prosecuted.
2512239	2513499	Parents know your ratings.
2513579	2517620	They are not difficult, and I agree with Rob that ratings should be the same as movies.
2517660	2526643	GTA series are rated by the BBFC as an 18, same as violent movie out here over here in the U.K.,
2527233	2529858	He also mentions to Matt, you two are quite correct.
2529898	2531121	Parents should do their own homework.
2531461	2533846	Who's responsible for a kid when they're out in the street playing?
2534087	2537193	It's no longer acceptable to say, it's okay, he's upstairs playing on his computer.
2537513	2538856	Look what happened to Matthew Broderick.
2542415	2543396	That's a good reference.
2544437	2545699	Would you like to play a game?
2545899	2547300	I'm thrilled that someone agrees with me.
2547340	2550724	That makes 50 episodes of doing this crap so worth it that somebody agrees with me.
2551625	2554348	My last thing on this.
2554408	2558112	I leave you with a quote from a congressional hearing chaired by Joe Lieberman.
2558432	2559474	This was a few years ago.
2560475	2562497	It was nice to see he still hates video games.
2563123	2567028	This quote is from Marilyn Droz, the VP of National Coalition of Television Violence.
2567048	2568089	This is what she had to say.
2568790	2582686	If the Pentagon was to ever have suggested years ago that we put video games that teach children how to aim guns and train them at the age of eight to be soldiers and ever invented a game to put in the homes of young boys to train them to be in the military, I can't begin to tell you...
2583647	2588049	You know what kind of uproar there would be in this country if our government was to start training early killers.
2590530	2592430	You mentioned on there America's Army.
2592490	2594611	Isn't that what America's Army does?
2594971	2597292	She was talking about the Nintendo Super Scope.
2600953	2602894	I thought that was such a wonderful point.
2603154	2605815	The Nintendo Super Scope was nothing.
2606508	2608349	I know, I was playing Blastress.
2608630	2609971	I know, and the mole game.
2610171	2610651	Come on.
2610671	2611712	This mole game was stupid.
2612112	2613013	But... Hey.
2613653	2622019	But I would, honestly, I would really, for those last two letters, I would really love to have our writers' permission to post those on our site, really.
2622039	2622379	Great.
2622419	2627283	Because those are the most well-thought-out things I have read in the past couple weeks.
2628123	2628404	Awesome.
2628424	2632606	Well, if you guys want to send us an email, togo, T-O-G-O, at orangeloungeradio.com.
2632647	2634468	Any last little bits you want to read?
2634488	2635228	Anything?
2635929	2636009	Um...
2638204	2640467	I've gotten several emails along the same lines.
2642009	2649238	One of our friends, our listeners, John wrote in, basically saying more of the same.
2650400	2654385	I especially like the point saying is that, you know,
2655888	2666472	No matter if you're into the violent games, listen to emo music or horror movies, you can still be a peaceful person.
2668393	2670074	I really liked that one point there.
2670434	2672975	Saying emo reminds me of this simple fact.
2672995	2675036	Do you know what is ten times worse than video games?
2675496	2675736	Emo?
2675996	2677037	No, Myspace.
2678436	2681099	I swear to God, Myspace is worse than any video game I've ever seen.
2681560	2686566	I mean, really, and... Every kid has a profile on Myspace, it's sad.
2686909	2689709	Well, I thought it was funny that he did actually mirror something that you said.
2690030	2691950	I'll just quote this last and that's the end of the mailbox.
2692010	2692270	Alrighty.
2692290	2693570	Because we got a lot of mail this time around.
2693590	2693810	I know.
2694130	2695470	This law is not a ban.
2695530	2699011	It's simply a way to prevent kids from buying games that their parents might not approve of.
2699691	2702772	Honest, caring, and hardworking parents work until 5 or 6 p.m.
2703192	2706952	With their child at home, they can't prevent them from going to the store and buying a GTA-type game.
2707993	2708273	True.
2708653	2708853	True.
2709073	2712273	And on that respect, I do support that aspect of it.
2712293	2713813	I think I said as much last week.
2714454	2716674	It's just that I still think that
2719511	2729919	It is really difficult, I think, on parents to have that kind of active stance in their children's lives, but I still think that if they weren't ready for the responsibility, they shouldn't have had the children to begin with.
2731220	2731460	Alright.
2731661	2735463	Well, we look forward to getting your more emails to go at originalsradio.com.
2735503	2736624	Let's get back into some news.
2737765	2743049	Now, Loki, I brought up the Video Game Awards on Spike TV there a little bit, and I know you caught a little glimpse of it.
2743370	2744711	Did you watch the whole damn thing, or what happened?
2744811	2747673	I watched the after show, and
2748280	2749961	I think this is the way video game award shows should be.
2749981	2750301	I mean, this is
2777978	2778778	It was really good actually.
2778958	2779898	It was a very good show.
2780198	2782319	Definitely a whole lot better than G4ia.
2783759	2787300	What they started off with is Samuel L. Jackson because he was hosting the whole thing.
2787340	2788980	I mean that's good just from the start.
2789400	2794982	He was playing the part of, and I haven't played this far into the Warriors or haven't seen the movie yet.
2795062	2798562	The main character in the Warriors, you know the guy in the beginning like, can you dig it?
2798942	2801703	But they had all the video game characters in the audience and the crowd.
2802082	2805104	And the best part about the whole thing is you see the Katamari rolling around.
2805625	2808147	It's picking up people as it's going along and stuff.
2808187	2809288	And that was the greatest thing ever.
2809848	2815172	And then Tack from Tack 3 or whatever he's called.
2815232	2816954	He's all, Warriors!
2817154	2818455	Come out and play!
2818595	2821577	And he shoots Samuel L. Jackson.
2821597	2823238	And I thought that was great.
2823319	2824379	It was really funny.
2825820	2828703	They put a whole MTV Music Awards spin on it.
2828763	2830204	And I really liked the way they did that.
2830512	2831513	I watched about five minutes.
2831534	2832295	I thought it was stupid.
2832615	2832915	Sorry.
2833917	2839825	The music part was stupid, but I did like the fact that they were doing this kind of fun little twist on it and stuff.
2840486	2844572	However, though, they are still... Being that there's only really two award shows out there, they are still...
2845154	2846495	You know, highly superior to G4U.
2847395	2847756	We'll see.
2849096	2851958	Jamie, I'm curious if you heard about this because I'm sure you've got to have an opinion on this.
2852278	2854159	Talk about the wrong way to hold a protest.
2854199	2855180	Did you hear about this kid?
2855460	2865326	It was like some 16-year-old kid got basically arrested, or charged anyway, by threatening the one and only Jack Thompson with torture and death.
2866947	2871269	He basically, I don't know, sent this thing that said all these nasty things he was going to do to Jack Thompson.
2871329	2872150	It's kind of one of those, like,
2872748	2873228	Jack Thompson
2902469	2911472	I know, and I feel bad because now I'm contributing to this, but I'm only reporting what's out there on the internet, because half the gaming sites out there also report this.
2911552	2915773	It's kind of like... I thought we were bad attention whores.
2917414	2919134	Of course, we don't get death threats often.
2923018	2924159	and I'm tired of talking about him
2945712	2953477	I am not saying that I am going to inject him with cancerous cells so that he dies of liver cancer, but if he does I'd like to report it.
2957660	2960022	Swiftly changing the subject over to Castlevania.
2960082	2961403	Let's talk about Castlevania.
2962684	2964045	I think this is kind of interesting.
2964966	2971451	Konami, for no real reason, is going to be packaging Aria of Sorrow and Harmony of Dissonance together into one game.
2971852	2973253	And that will be coming out the first quarter of 2006.
2973633	2976636	And there's no real reason why they're doing it.
2976776	2978397	They're not really adding anything to these games.
2978958	2984723	I think they're doing this because DS is selling so freaking huge, and so they want to capitalize on that.
2984743	2985904	They buy little stuff all the time.
2987145	2988906	Pretty game, pretty.
2988926	2992249	Those two would still sell separately on their own, except I don't think they make either one anymore.
2992269	2993390	If I didn't already have them, I'd buy them.
2994167	2995207	I know, that's kind of how I feel.
2996047	3000649	Jamie, you have a story about another racing game.
3000669	3004729	We've been talking about Project Gotham and all this other stuff, but you have a racing game that sounds pretty hot.
3004990	3005370	No, no, no.
3005430	3007910	Best racing game series ever.
3008190	3008810	Outrun.
3009051	3009631	Woo-hoo.
3010871	3015192	You know, at my house, you've seen at my house, classic Sega Horror House.
3016072	3017172	That didn't sound too right.
3017372	3019493	Anyway, I digress.
3020385	3024093	SIGA's announced OutRun 2006 and we all cheer yay!
3024273	3024714	Yay!
3029541	3037846	Basically, Sega's confirmed Outrun 2006 Coast to Coast will be released March 2006 on the PS2, PSP, and PC.
3037906	3038526	But guess what?
3038587	3039747	Not on... Arcade.
3040148	3040608	Xbox.
3041689	3042329	And no arcade.
3043310	3049694	I didn't see... It's going to be 30 stages, the best of both Outrun 2 and Outrun 2 SP.
3050815	3053796	Mission structure, licensed mode, 6 player online.
3054237	3055998	Total of 12 licensed Ferraris.
3056892	3059453	including the F430 and Super America.
3059493	3061474	Well, you said something about Outrun 2 and previous Outruns.
3061514	3063615	They're not just repackaging the same crap, right?
3063635	3065356	They're gonna give it a facelift and everything.
3065516	3066797	Bring it to the next gen, right?
3067197	3068138	That's what it sounds like.
3068158	3068858	They're effing better.
3069538	3078423	Um... Also, it says PSP owners who also have the PS2 version will be able to access exclusive content by hooking them up.
3079203	3079543	Ooh!
3079704	3080964	With the USB cable.
3081364	3082185	Finally a use!
3083045	3084846	They actually do that with a lot of games.
3085627	3086187	Do they?
3086247	3086407	Yeah.
3086812	3090595	Well, at any rate, it's being put out in development by Sumo Digital.
3091015	3093577	They actually were the ones who ported Outrun 2 to Xbox.
3094058	3099822	Like WWE, SmackDown vs. Raw 6, SOCOM, Fireteam Bravo, and SOCOM 3.
3103745	3104105	Madden.
3106887	3108408	Alright, Loki, I'm about out of stuff.
3108428	3109449	What else you got for us tonight?
3109869	3112732	I know you had something on Metal Gear or something and a pretty cool hack.
3113872	3114373	Metal Gear?
3114946	3117288	Did you say you had something about Metal Gear Acid 2 or something?
3117508	3118148	Oh, no.
3118188	3119169	Yeah, Metal Gear Acid 2.
3120230	3121250	It's actually quite funny.
3121430	3126494	They found out one of the things that's actually featured in the game because someone, of course, dumped the ROM for it.
3127314	3129856	And they discovered videos of... Wait, is the game out?
3130256	3131177	Yeah, in Japan.
3131497	3131878	Oh, okay.
3132518	3139102	Of scantily clad women for use with that special viewing device that they have, the solid eye.
3139923	3143345	So you get 3D video of scantily clad women as well as...
3145273	3147414	A trailer for Rainbow Roses XX, which is kind of cool.
3147614	3147874	Hot.
3149214	3155497	In other news, this is called, you know, it's bound to happen sooner or later.
3155597	3159918	The first 360 game has been dumped to a hard drive.
3160918	3166200	A group going by the name of Pi has released a 360 dump extract tool.
3166220	3170742	They were able to rip apart the games to extract them to their PC's hard drive.
3171682	3173583	Getting the run on the other hand, that's another story.
3173663	3174123	But still...
3175652	3177252	One small step for hackers.
3177853	3178093	Yeah.
3179473	3180533	One giant... forget it.
3181453	3181754	Anyways.
3183254	3184114	So that was interesting.
3184274	3204539	Speaking of more hacking stuff, this guy, actually, going by the name of Parasite, has shown that you can hack levels into your online Wi-Fi for Mario Kart DS, and he's been able to play such levels as the TikTok clock and other stuff.
3206223	3212055	I don't think they've released how they've done this yet, but it has been shown and people have been doing it online.
3212436	3213358	It's kind of interesting.
3213418	3215884	Some of the levels kind of glitch out a little bit, but
3217622	3219563	Booby Prize Bike Race Any Tips for Winning?
3248154	3248534	I don't know.
3248995	3251637	I didn't actually finish the game or play many of the missions.
3251677	3256182	I just put a 100% code in to get all the characters for multiplayer.
3256202	3256602	Cheater!
3257102	3257763	Well, here's what.
3257863	3259124	I only play it for multiplayer.
3259265	3260666	That's all I play the game for now.
3260786	3263589	So I don't actually play three of the missions and stuff.
3263649	3266231	So I just wanted to have all the characters unlocked and everything.
3266531	3268573	I can't point fingers because I'm cheating at Silent Hill 3.
3268613	3270735	You're going to have to go to GameFAQs, my friend.
3271056	3271336	Sorry.
3271977	3273438	Yeah, GameFAQs would be a good place to check.
3274662	3278525	I did send a very interesting link at themushroomkingdom.net.
3280005	3281426	It's the Super Mario Bros.
3281446	3282687	3, their lost levels.
3284408	3285989	I'll just read the first paragraph from that page.
3286529	3287670	Deep within Super Mario Bros.
3287930	3289391	3 lie hidden, unused levels.
3289511	3296476	Some of them seem polished with working goals and plenty of enemies, while others are devoid of enemies, lacking exits or too short to be full levels.
3297596	3298957	There's actually a couple of pictures of them.
3298997	3299897	One of them uses the boot.
3300737	3301217	I love the boot.
3301237	3304198	That's great because only like one level in the actual game used the boot.
3304498	3305538	And it was so short.
3305978	3306679	And the boot was cool.
3307079	3309759	But it's pretty cool because the level maps are up on the page.
3309839	3314781	I'd say people should check it out if you're an old school Super Mario Brothers player.
3314801	3316781	But you know, that actually goes back into what we were saying.
3316821	3319782	There's always unused code in games.
3320102	3326104	Yeah, I mean, this could have easily been Mario Hot Coffee where Mario and the princess get it on.
3328120	3329241	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3358354	3360376	No, not, no.
3360736	3361797	Loki, anything else?
3362338	3367322	I just have one more, and that's this product has been released.
3368383	3373127	Basically, it's on this website, gameback-web.com.
3373507	3374488	It's in their web store.
3374588	3375769	It's called the PSP Bank.
3375849	3378712	It's basically a 40 gigabyte hard drive for the PSP.
3379652	3384977	What it looks actually to be is a PSP, it's a hard drive that has a USB on the go.
3385444	3388446	so you can actually transfer stuff between the hard drive and the PSP.
3388987	3392509	However, you can't actually just access the entire hard drive using the PSP.
3393670	3397193	So, not quite cool, but a step in the right direction, I guess.
3397593	3403237	And also, there was another development here, which is quite interesting.
3403958	3408141	The guy that's basically behind... Oh, what was it here?
3410262	3413865	Who's behind the cheat device for Grand Theft Auto, or
3414684	3416326	They think it's actually done the same way.
3417087	3425738	Basically working on running firmware on 2.01 and 2.5 firmware, so maybe 2.6 running the homebrew stuff.
3426979	3429923	So it's being worked on and probably cracked soon.
3432830	3437235	One more story I got for you guys, and that has to do... I knew Jamie would get a kick out of this one.
3437816	3442421	I went to Slashdot earlier this week, and I saw this, and I totally thought of you, Jamie.
3443122	3445985	The headline is, Gamers Better at Driving with Cell Phones?
3447822	3448943	Okay, you know what?
3449343	3450484	Hold on, I haven't read it yet.
3451805	3452165	Let's see.
3453466	3459770	These psychologists who are studying multitasking have argued for years about these information bottlenecks, and they want to know why this occurs.
3459810	3461031	Is it because people are lazy?
3461431	3463813	Because they have an inability to switch from one task to another?
3464193	3464573	Who knows?
3464653	3470377	But this Mei-Chang Lin, who is an assistant professor of psychology at Oregon State University, said...
3472427	3479014	Even with a seemingly simple task, structural cognitive limitations can prevent you from efficiently switching to a new task.
3479595	3483920	I have to say that the best ones are those who play a lot of video games, she pointed out.
3484878	3486979	Those are lab studies, however, not driving tests.
3488660	3490521	So because you play video games, you're good at multitasking.
3490541	3496085	So therefore, gamers, throw those headsets away because you can multitask.
3496165	3496985	I've said it once.
3497626	3499247	I've said it a bajillion times.
3499907	3501988	And somebody in this room is included in that.
3502609	3506151	If you drive and talk on your cell phone, you are being a big dumb butt.
3507031	3509433	You are endangering your life and those of other people.
3510106	3511647	I'm multitasking, what can I say?
3512067	3514089	Actually, it's impossible to multitask.
3514609	3515910	I can multitask.
3516290	3516930	I'm a good driver.
3518011	3518791	Final thoughts.
3519852	3521033	Loki, your final thought.
3521133	3521693	I want to get better.
3523534	3525936	My final thought is I hate being sick.
3526496	3527037	DarkSakura?
3528818	3530159	I'm tired of having the plague.
3530199	3531920	I've been sick since November 4th.
3532780	3533981	I don't think I'm ever going to get better.
3535868	3537870	Well, that's a happy note to end episode 50 on.
3537950	3541313	So, congratulations, we made it through 50 episodes.
3541493	3541993	Yay!
3543194	3544936	Here we come to 51 next week.
3544976	3545536	We'll see you then.
3546177	3548119	Actually, you know who we haven't heard from all episode?
3550661	3551221	Oh, God.
3551922	3553723	One of our very special hosts.
3554104	3554364	Yes.
3556306	3556726	The ferret.
3557887	3558327	Thanks for that.
3558427	3561470	Oh, by the way, episode 51, we will be burning the ferret live on air.
3561490	3562291	No, we will not!
3563393	3564073	See you next time.
3564113	3568856	Tell a friend about Orange Lounge Radio to go and make our ratings go through the roof because we like attention.
3569036	3569236	Bye.
3571217	3574778	That's the end of another Orange Lounge Radio to go edition.
