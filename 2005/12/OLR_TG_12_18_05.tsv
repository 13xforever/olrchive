464	3025	Orange Lounge Radio To Go Edition, week of December 19th, 2005.
3305	13547	You're tuned in to the Orange Lounge Radio To Go Edition, your podcast home for all the latest video game news and gamer chat.
13827	17668	Now, here are your hosts, DarkSakura, Sky, and Loki.
19568	20348	Hello, everybody.
20448	27650	Once again, welcome to Orange Lounge Radio To Go, that podcast dedicated to video games and gaming.
28493	35718	We especially like to talk about games that don't suck, but you know, once in a while we gotta bring up games that do suck because we have to tell you to avoid them, like the plague.
36399	42983	And I'm happy to report that I've escaped the plague, I'm not sick anymore, I'm feeling a lot better than I was last week for our 50th episode.
43044	45585	But over there, DarkSakura, how you doing?
45605	46926	You still a little plague-y, DarkSakura?
46946	49248	I'm still the carrier of the evil plague.
49628	50669	Are you infected?
51830	57454	I'm infected, but I don't think that I have the T-virus anymore because I haven't started trying to, you know,
57915	59475	to eat my husband for dinner.
59755	60696	Oh good, that's good.
60816	63096	You know, I haven't been sniffing his spicy brains.
63156	65677	Yeah, you've gone seven weeks without doing that, huh?
66117	69718	Yeah, I've actually gone seven weeks without eating much of anything.
70858	73458	But hey, leaves me more money to spend on games.
73659	74159	There you go.
74739	76099	Loki, I won't get to your games in a minute.
76139	77799	Loki, how you doing?
78740	80740	I'm still a bit congested, yes.
81360	82941	But mostly plague-free, like 99.7% plague-free.
85034	93437	Yes, 99.9% Plague 3, but I did think I had the T-Virus because I did eat my fianc√©.
93517	98179	You need to not bring that on the show.
98633	107519	My name is Rob Roberts, also known as Sky, and I will be going back to a cleaner subject, such as, how was your gaming week, DarkSakura?
107599	109361	And that's a clean subject, huh?
109401	112303	Yes, DarkSakura, lots of Animal Crossing.
112323	114684	Oh, I'm sorry, I don't want to talk too much about Animal Crossing again.
114845	115085	Oh, no.
116226	116766	Guess what?
116906	118087	I played Animal Crossing.
118867	119428	Anything else?
122501	124241	Not really, because last week was finals.
125322	127222	However, I did do something game-related.
128562	132983	And I can post a link to this on our forums, which people should be visiting.
133123	141945	Of course, at OrangeLogsRadio.com But I did a game slipcover and backcover for Silent Hill, the movie, the game.
142465	145486	The irony is that I was doing a game based off a movie, based off a game.
145726	147607	Is that like Street Fighter II, the movie, the game?
148127	149067	Except it doesn't suck ass.
150575	151656	But this is not a real game.
151716	152676	Let's just get that clear.
152696	153497	It's not a real game.
153517	160461	But our illustrator project was to either do a CD, like music CD or game CD.
161242	163063	So I picked Silent Hill the Movie the Game.
163163	165104	I'm telling you, you need to do that poster project.
165164	167686	You should take that concept and make it like a poster.
168447	168747	You know what?
169107	169527	Hell with it.
169567	170828	Just send that in as your poster.
171308	172149	See what happens.
172189	173170	You never know what might happen.
173550	175091	I'd have to do a whole lot more to it.
175331	177733	However, it did give me some ideas for the poster.
177773	178213	So perhaps...
178968	179869	I'll make a project of that.
179889	182710	Get that done, though, because the deadline's fast approaching.
183291	183511	I know.
183711	186033	Anything else you've been playing this week?
187814	189555	No Silent Hill 3, no Sexy Dean?
189595	195559	You know, because all I did was work on my final projects for the first half of the week.
196880	201763	I honestly have not had time, but however, now that school's let out, I do have more time to play games.
201883	206546	I'm actually hunting down my Silent Hill 3 strategy guide right now because I need the map for the level I'm in.
206826	207606	Very nice.
207627	208347	I'm still in the hospital.
208786	210307	I do have to ask an Animal Crossing question.
210327	215851	I don't want to go into Animal Crossing ad nauseum again this week, but didn't you say there was a baby lost in your village?
216412	219374	Didn't you sell the baby to Tom Nook or something for bells?
219594	226019	I wanted to sell the baby to Crazy Red to sell on the black market, but he wasn't there, and so Loki rescued him and brought him back to his mommy.
227080	227700	That's very nice.
228301	228961	Good to hear.
229261	231023	But I did sell some furniture.
232984	234345	Loki, how was your gaming week?
234926	236447	My gaming week was diverse.
237588	237988	I played...
238678	242561	Some Animal Crossing, Grand Theft Auto Liberty City Stories, Five Player Deathmatches
259082	259663	Call of Duty 2 Deathmatches
275393	276594	And that game's actually really cool.
276854	278234	I'm very pleased with it.
278694	280375	I haven't played much Perfect Dark.
280655	281816	Did play a little bit of Cameo.
281956	283396	That was really cool.
283996	284797	Still pretty easy.
285397	288958	But overall, decent game for a launch, I guess.
289179	290419	What does Cameo really like?
290599	291479	It's a platform game.
292080	292600	What does that mean?
292740	295181	Does it mean like a Crash Bandicoot type of game, or what?
296522	296982	Spyro?
297182	299383	It's a platform game.
299403	304545	Basically a lot of jumping, figuring out puzzles, killing things, and...
305513	315124	Not really much in the collecting stuff, but it's just kind of your normal, you know, like Mario 64 minus all the, you know... Okay, I gotcha, I gotcha.
316345	318848	Actually, I did have one thing to add that's related to Loki's week.
319008	319309	What's that?
319469	320670	He gave me Papa Lucros.
321551	322292	Ah, for the PSP.
322352	324014	And I'm going to be playing the hell out of it.
324134	326757	Alright, well then I expect a full review next week, young lady.
327767	328989	Oh, ow.
329129	331273	I sucked my thumb out and I popped my elbow.
331534	332976	Oh, if only we were TV sometimes.
333037	335501	Anyway, anything else, Loki?
335622	336583	Other than that, no.
336864	338327	I haven't planned anything else.
339278	344043	I will not be talking about Animal Crossing this week in my gaming week because Animal Crossing got the boot from my DS.
344083	344523	Actually, it didn't.
344563	354714	It's still sitting there in the top slot, but it's sitting there completely unloved because a new game went into the bottom slot on my DS, and that was Final Fantasy IV Advance I picked up earlier this week.
355575	357277	I have not stopped playing it since I got it.
357377	357737	And I...
358598	359379	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
375642	376883	I really haven't played through it since.
376963	388151	I touched on it a little bit when I was on PlayStation in the Final Fantasy Chronicles pack that came out, but I never really got super into it because I couldn't stay on the loading times before the battle, even though it was bad enough.
389633	393535	But now, since there are no loading times on this, it's so awesome.
393876	400320	I'm rediscovering this classic, classic game, and Final Fantasy IV is a classic title.
400360	402482	If you are into role-playing games in any form,
402898	414874	you must respect what this game did for future role playing games it is a must play game if you did not play through it before now I'm sure a lot of folks are thinking well what the hell makes this worth buying again if I already had this before
415646	429433	and the answer is that the script, which right there ought to sell this because if you played Final Fantasy 2 on Super Nintendo with the original translation, the nice thing is they kept that line intact as a throwback to the fans.
429593	432155	It's still you Spoonie Bard because I've gotten through that part of the game.
432455	434336	I've put in like five or six hours on that game.
434736	438418	Cecil's already a pallet and I'm already like, I've played that game a lot, okay?
438438	439459	That's been my week pretty much.
441471	448218	But they changed the script to put all the emotion and words and story really back into the game.
448258	457767	It's kind of like before, you just had from point A to point B. You had the words that got you from point A to point B, but now it's really fleshed out and the story carries more emotion.
458127	463573	And it's amazing when you consider this 2D game is emotional, but it's great.
463693	464634	I can't say enough things about it.
465014	465554	They put...
466491	469354	All the original moves back into it.
469394	476340	So a lot of folks, like, you know when you go and you become a paladin for the first time, you have to fight yourself as a Dark Knight.
476380	481165	But when you first played it on the Super Nintendo, the Dark Knight did a move, like he did this wavy beam move.
481185	482326	And you're like, what the hell?
482546	483707	How come I couldn't do that before?
484007	485288	Well, now you can.
485389	488111	They put that move back in because that was in the original Japanese game.
488151	488852	You can do that again.
489172	491174	So it's great because they put all these old moves back in.
491903	494104	and the game is 14 years old.
494144	496926	You probably haven't touched this game in a long time.
497006	503771	Maybe you have through the use of emulators but I'm betting 95% of the people that listen to this show and play Final Fantasy 2 haven't touched it in the 14 years since.
504431	505992	Now's the time to go back and rediscover it.
506432	509694	And I know a lot of people are saying why the hell didn't they do this sooner?
510115	512856	Why didn't they put this on the Game Boy Advance when the Advance was first out?
512976	513317	I don't know.
513337	514137	They probably should have.
514437	515238	But when you think about it
516061	516642	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
528806	531367	Final Fantasy 4 and the awesome game that it is.
531827	532647	And now is the chance.
532707	534547	And I say seize that opportunity.
534627	536448	I give this game my highest recommendation.
536768	541289	It is a must play game if you are into role playing games in any capacity.
541369	543190	Even if you aren't, you need to give this one a try.
543310	547391	Besides, even if you're thinking about it, what else is there to buy that's coming out this month?
548131	548631	Gauntlet?
550820	551980	I played Gauntlet at E3.
552000	554301	It looks okay, but you know what?
554381	556241	I don't care about anything else until I beat Final Fantasy 4.
556341	556681	And you know what?
556701	558282	For the next two weeks, you're probably going to hear me saying this.
558362	559162	All I played was Final Fantasy 4.
559762	560882	Sorry, I have to do this.
561222	562503	This is my childhood coming back.
562583	567364	To ask you, do you know if it's a port of the WonderSwan version?
568924	571284	I don't know, because I don't know enough about the WonderSwan version.
571304	573925	I can tell you that it is not easy type.
574285	578366	It is the original Japanese, because you can...
579761	583362	I'm sorry, you don't have a heal potion, you have like the gold needle, the maiden's kiss.
583682	584582	Everything is split up like that.
585082	586862	Palom and Porom you will be able to bring back.
586902	590283	That's the other big catch about this game is that you can switch your characters now.
590343	597624	Later in the game, any character that disappeared you couldn't use in the final Zero Mist battle, Edward, Palom, Porom, Yang, you get to bring them all back.
597664	600105	They'll be in Mysidia waiting for you to switch out.
600445	602205	And apparently there's two new dungeons as well.
602245	603345	I haven't even gotten to that point yet.
603365	605206	So I'm giddy about getting to that point.
605326	605826	That's pretty cool.
607006	627718	is I remember um because you remember when I was back in my my WonderSwan everything oh yeah oh yeah WonderSwan was I I don't know why they never tried that here but well maybe because Nintendo's so dominating I don't know well I picked up the Final Fantasy the first one the WonderSwan package let's back up a minute because I'm betting that probably a good portion of our listeners don't even know what the hell a WonderSwan is what is a WonderSwan
628251	630853	It was Bandai's handheld system.
631253	638977	In fact, just to point out something, if anyone's ever seen the Street Fighter OAV anime, the one with Sakura and everything, at the end of it, she's playing Street Fighter on a regular WonderSwan.
639618	641279	So there's a point of reference.
641299	643100	But it was not released here in the U.S.
643140	643900	It was only in Japan.
644020	652125	Right, and when Dan and I found out that we were releasing the first Final Fantasy with a special limited edition WonderSwan, we was like, okay, that's ours.
652445	655247	I thought the WonderSwan came out over here very limited.
655487	657448	No, that was Neo Geo Pocket Color that we got.
657825	658745	No, there was something else.
659226	660966	Maybe it was Tiger Electronics' thing.
660986	662487	They had a portable system, I thought.
662747	667629	Regardless, even if it did come out in some limited capacity, I'm betting half our listeners don't even know of its existence.
668289	670691	The good Digimon games were on WonderSwan.
671391	673792	Actually, Rockman and Bass were on...
674696	675437	The old WonderSwan.
675837	677279	And there's a WonderSwan Crystal out now.
677699	683786	So in fact, Final Fantasy 1 and 2 on Game Boy Advance are pretty much just the WonderSwan versions with some minor tweaks.
683806	685688	1, 2, and 4 came out on WonderSwan.
685708	689332	They did not bring out 3, which pissed me off so much because that was the one I wanted.
689792	692095	It was the first one with the job change system.
692155	692736	Right, right.
692756	693737	Which is what I love about 5.
693797	696380	That's the one that they're going back and tweaking really bad for the DS.
696900	702115	and Rumor is that if Final Fantasy IV Advanced sells well, which I think it will, V and VI are pretty much a given.
702155	704702	In fact, I thought I read somewhere they're already working on VI.
705635	713763	We went back and played 5 on PS2, although I had already been playing an emulated version and I had actually been playing it in Japanese for a little while too.
714444	724333	But the good thing about the first one on WonderSwan is that because most of it was in Hiragana, I could sort of read what was going on.
724734	727757	I could at least read the spells and I could read the materials, which was easy enough.
728857	732158	But it was so pretty and the music was so good.
732218	733479	They had completely redone it.
733919	737200	And I know that 4 was given the same treatment.
737240	743362	I'm wondering... 4, they went back and did, at least on advance, they went back and did some of the graphics.
743402	745162	Some of the sprites are cleaned up a little bit.
745663	749824	But the music, really, I don't notice that much of a change.
749884	752605	It is different, but only slight in some of the instrumentation.
752985	754905	To me, I don't notice the difference.
755005	756626	But somebody very picky will notice it.
756926	765112	Well, also there's the difference between the MIDI synthesizers on the NES and what we got that have to have done it closer to the original.
765752	768174	Well, when you're talking about NES versus Advance, yes.
768214	771497	But I'm talking about the Famicom versus NES.
771677	772277	Oh, oh, yeah, yeah.
772297	774779	The instrumentation could have very likely been different on the Japanese one.
774799	775680	Absolutely, absolutely.
776660	778422	Ooh, that's a lot of Final Fantasy geekery.
778462	779703	We better move on to other topics.
779903	780183	Yeah.
780583	781063	That's all right.
781083	782144	Anyway, that was fun, though.
782685	785867	We haven't talked about the WonderSwan yet in like 50 episodes of Orange Lounge, so.
786209	786870	I'll bring it one day.
812538	816340	Sega is actually coming out with two games for the handheld systems.
816940	819261	There's one on the PSP, one on the GBA.
819881	823783	The PSP title doesn't have a name yet, but it's being done by Totally Games.
824484	828605	That's the studio that did X-Wing vs. TIE Fighter, Secret Weapons Over Normandy.
829906	831547	Yay.
832307	839951	There's also... They're saying, though, that it's a classic game that they're trying to bring back.
839991	840491	I'm wondering...
841593	842874	Exactly which one it's going to be.
843755	845897	But there's been nothing really official listed as the title.
846917	850440	To the Sega gods, if you happen to be listening, Echo the Dolphin, please.
850600	854143	I don't know why that comes to my mind, but I would like to see that come back.
854163	857666	The last Echo game we got was on Dreamcast, and it was kind of... It was kind of poop?
858507	859287	Not really poop.
859667	863030	I actually didn't get to play much of it, but it was... I never really saw it.
863591	865472	I heard that it got sort of eh results.
865652	866673	How about ToeJam & Earl?
866693	868034	That would be kind of cool, too.
868054	868354	No, please.
868535	868995	Oh, come on.
870379	872981	They did a ToeJam & Earl 2, but it was poopy, wasn't it?
873602	874322	Vectorman!
874342	875603	We need Vectorman back!
876004	876244	Anyway.
876724	880987	No, the other one... Oh, actually, there is a little bit more on this.
881108	885831	The game was described as a run-and-gun blast-a-thon, quote.
885891	888713	It actually makes references to Robotron and Smash TV.
890395	891155	More money!
891316	892036	More prizes!
892436	893077	I love it!
894664	900466	The next one is the Tower SP Game Boy exclusive from Vivarium.
901786	910548	It's going to be quoted as an in-depth sim experience as you design, manage, build everyday running of a skyscraper.
911749	916170	You can build a basement or a luxury or...
916937	917277	and so on.
943160	945862	Smash TV did get a lot of play in my house lately, like in the last week.
965709	966771	Isn't that weird?
968413	979848	Some of the most talked about Xbox 360 things right now is old shit, like Smash TV, and not so much that Geometry Wars is old shit, but it's pretty shit that you could do on...
980909	984011	Old-style consoles, probably, but yet it's so cool and pretty.
984151	984472	I don't know.
984532	985813	It's like updated asteroids.
986173	987114	I don't know how to explain it.
987834	989495	But back to Sega.
989875	990076	Sorry.
991016	993918	The PSP title, there's not any release date yet.
994038	997080	However, the Tower SP is slated for March 2006 release.
999198	1000699	The Family Entertainment Protection Act
1016305	1019510	Just to follow up, it is now officially before Congress.
1020251	1023656	Granted, it'll probably be one of the first things they pick up when Congress goes back into session.
1023736	1026320	So you'll see some fun debates about this.
1026801	1031168	If you have a very strong position one way or the other on this, I urge you to write.
1031448	1032109	Thanks for watching!
1049830	1051511	Have a friend proofread it if you're not sure.
1052452	1057256	In other law news, an Alabama judge has said this is denied.
1057376	1062740	It was a lawsuit filed against Take-Two by families of police officers.
1063761	1074749	It was Grand Theft Auto inspired, basically, saying that Grand Theft Auto inspired these kids to kill the cops in the family's suit, Take-Two.
1075310	1076130	It got thrown out.
1078103	1088787	Kind of interesting, Alabama's kind of the home of all this stuff lately because wasn't that also where Jack Thompson's right to practice law kind of got booted out or something?
1088807	1089187	Guess what?
1089667	1090888	This was the same judge.
1092668	1094169	Same judge, Judge James Moore.
1094849	1096610	He must be the only judge in Alabama, I don't know.
1096890	1097970	Bless my home state.
1097990	1102111	You know what's funny is hearing Judge James Moore makes me think of Jay Moore.
1102692	1103652	That's a funny thought.
1104349	1105471	Give this guy a TV show.
1105491	1106954	This is the judge I want to see on TV.
1106994	1111122	He absolutely gets major kudos for me.
1111222	1113146	It makes me proud to be an Alabamian.
1114088	1114368	Yep.
1114809	1115591	Makes my heart hurt.
1117283	1118984	All right, let's move on.
1119344	1121705	Loki, what do you got for us tonight?
1122125	1123305	Talk to me a little bit about 360.
1123705	1124125	Tell us about 360.
1124546	1129447	First off, I know this wasn't on your list, but what happened with the Best Buy thing?
1129487	1133489	Like, there was the list on the internet that said that all these Best Buys are going to have the game.
1133529	1133989	What happened?
1134069	1138250	Well, the whole drama behind the Best Buy thing is this basically was like a second launch.
1138290	1143572	There was supposed to be about 300,000 units being sent throughout the entire United States.
1144682	1147083	So, same kind of allocations they were getting before.
1148424	1150745	Now, here are the rules for this.
1151205	1153486	They were receiving their shipments on Friday.
1153506	1157008	They were supposed to hold them for Sunday for their sale that was going to be advertised.
1157028	1158368	They were not to pre-sell them.
1158748	1159889	They were not to open early.
1161701	1162461	Did they follow that?
1162561	1162761	No.
1163001	1167203	They sold them early, they opened early, people were disappointed.
1167343	1170383	When you say they select stores, because we can't pinpoint who did it.
1170403	1178446	Select stores opened early and sold early, and so people were camping in line, and from what I hear too, some stores didn't even get them.
1178926	1183187	And so people were camping in line, and they get up there, oh, by the way, they're sold out.
1183507	1185608	Would you like a compact laptop instead?
1186128	1190369	So it was basically a lot of, you know, crap that
1191345	1191985	Hit the fan.
1192926	1193706	It wasn't pretty.
1193946	1197768	And a lot of people waited in line and some of them did get them.
1198248	1199169	A lot of people did not.
1199489	1202551	People still pissed at Microsoft.
1202971	1208413	But this is going to happen all over again because apparently another shipment is coming in on the 22nd.
1209674	1210134	Interesting.
1210995	1213716	So, yeah, it's pretty bad.
1213796	1215497	But, you know...
1216761	1218203	Thanks for watching!
1238334	1239695	Death or Alive Death or Alive
1260422	1262665	to launch that people were really looking forward to.
1262725	1265548	Ridge Racer was the top game for the Japanese market.
1265988	1272875	And then, of course, their RPGs like 99 Nights, well, sort of a Dynasty Warriors type game.
1273156	1278641	And then Enchanted Arm, the really big RPGs, they aren't coming out until next year.
1280263	1280684	So it sucks.
1282311	1283711	What else is going on in 360 News?
1284352	1291793	Other than that, they do have some really cool stuff that they've added to the Xbox Live Marketplace, which is really good.
1291933	1294993	Some new content, new cars to download for Ridge Racer 6.
1296074	1296974	Those are all free.
1297774	1308776	They're going to actually be adding a demo for Full Auto coming pretty soon, I think in this week or so, and I'm really looking forward to that, which is going to be awesome.
1309508	1315653	Now, I read about this, and I thought this sounded pretty cool, that the Xbox 360 is actually having a high-definition trailer for Mission Impossible 3.
1316454	1319356	It's available on the Xbox Live Marketplace, and you can download this.
1319416	1323879	It's some type of exclusive trailer thing that you can download.
1323960	1324800	Very interesting.
1324840	1331846	Kind of buys into that whole, the 360 and the next-gen systems may be more than a gaming system.
1332366	1333187	They're trying.
1333487	1334968	They did that with Narnia.
1335068	1337050	They had a trailer for Narnia on there and stuff.
1338011	1340292	I've seen the Mission Impossible 3 trailer.
1340332	1341973	It's just a teaser, and it's like, eh.
1342574	1343194	But think about that.
1343234	1348138	If you can download the trailer on the marketplace, what's to stop them later on from offering movies for download on the marketplace?
1348158	1348858	True, they could.
1348998	1351780	I see that as a logical next step for what the system's going to do.
1352120	1353221	And Sony, same thing.
1354582	1355203	I wouldn't doubt it.
1355503	1356784	I mean, it makes sense.
1357697	1361098	And I really do like the way they have the games online for free download.
1361218	1362278	I mean, that's really good.
1362318	1363639	They try out the demos and stuff.
1364259	1368380	I think it's great, and it'll really help them sell their games.
1368960	1370920	It's a really good tool that they have on there.
1371201	1373181	And plus, the extra content is really awesome.
1374301	1376402	I do like the fact that they have downloadable stuff.
1376742	1379883	Plus, you can pay for other things, like they have some extra sound...
1381138	1382720	Music Tracks for Ridge Racer
1401637	1405238	The first one was this one entitled the Extreme Edition.
1405578	1412601	Basically, they've done a red paint job on it, added a nice little window to it, and changed all the LEDs to red, which looks pretty cool.
1412681	1416762	And that's actually being sold on eBay for thousands of dollars.
1417963	1425925	Then the other one, which is less practical and less cool, would be a 360 being put inside of an Atari 2600.
1426005	1428806	Hey, I think that's pretty cool.
1429446	1430927	Well, you have to see it
1431351	1433472	To understand how... It looks ugly.
1433812	1434293	Ugly as hell.
1434533	1436114	It is pretty damn ugly.
1437094	1441437	But, you know, hey, give people time, they'll put it in anything.
1441457	1447760	I don't praise the modding community enough, but damn, they can be creative sometimes.
1447800	1448300	Seriously.
1448380	1452103	Not just... Just the modding and cracking and hacking scene in general.
1452203	1455084	Like, damn, there's some creative things people come up with.
1455144	1456945	It's like, why the hell would you do that?
1457265	1458646	Because I can.
1459567	1460087	Exactly.
1461587	1462488	Why would you put a 360 in the 2600?
1484389	1493475	Microsoft in both America and Japan has not announced anything regarding the possibility of a next generation DVD drive being placed in the Xbox 360.
1493515	1495076	This coming from a Microsoft spokesperson.
1495616	1500599	There are currently no plans to release an Xbox 360 equipped with a next generation DVD player.
1502180	1502381	Yet.
1502401	1504662	Makes sense because... I added the yet myself, but yet.
1504882	1508465	Makes sense because HD DVD, we don't even know if that's the format they're going to be going to.
1509705	1511787	Completely random subject here, but I don't care.
1511867	1512947	It's one of those shows tonight.
1512967	1513228	Um...
1514698	1521980	I helped my friend go shopping for a Christmas present and my friend was buying a DVD recorder for a friend and there's all these recording formats.
1522020	1527542	I don't know much about it but there's like the R's, the RW, the R pluses or whatever.
1527982	1534424	All these things and they're like all these different formats and no standardization and these recorders are huge Christmas things.
1534444	1538285	This is kind of dangerous because it's like VHS and beta all over again.
1538325	1539245	We need to find a standard.
1539605	1542926	The actual standalone recorders, there's
1543373	1547894	They have the plus and the minus, and then the R, plus or minus R is what it is.
1547914	1551295	See, I couldn't make sense of all of it because they all sound too similar for me.
1551395	1552835	Well, they are very similar.
1552895	1556476	Plus and minus R are very similar, and then RW is just a rewritable one.
1556516	1559777	Not similar enough because one won't play on the other, depending on the machine.
1559817	1560477	Some will play both.
1560577	1567539	Like, mine will actually play both, like on the burner on my laptop, but I think it only records on plus R's.
1567924	1571967	I think PlusR has been the format that's actually what's being used now.
1572007	1578092	I know my DVD burner and my computer will do both, but it burns basically one format.
1578132	1578892	I'm behind the times.
1578932	1581054	I have no DVD burner recorder or any of that stuff.
1581774	1582555	You're not missing much.
1583316	1589140	Actually, it's helped me out so much because I have a 250 gig hard drive on my PC that's almost full.
1589941	1591422	See, mine's not even near full yet.
1591542	1598127	But I can just go onto my network, burn off my stuff off of my laptop, save myself some space.
1598548	1598868	Alright.
1599288	1601090	Well, let's, okay, enough 360 talk.
1601890	1604652	DarkSakura, you have a story about another next-gen console.
1604693	1605153	What's going on?
1605785	1607768	Finally, some more stuff about the revolution.
1608649	1616761	Okay, apparently the system has been, some dev kits have been released to some third parties, so there's been some feedback received.
1618063	1622129	So far, it's looking like, just the information that's been given back.
1622869	1628312	This is going to be powered by IBM CPU codenamed Broadway, very similar to the Gecko CPU in the GameCube.
1629653	1637758	It should run about twice the clock speed, actually up to three times the overall performance of the GameCube processor.
1638759	1643942	And they have an HCI graphics chip codenamed Hollywood, which I find so ridiculous.
1643962	1644302	Interesting.
1644482	1644882	Interesting.
1648260	1659367	Just to look at this yet though, they're saying that it's going to be about two and a half times more powerful than the GameCube, which is... The GameCube wasn't too bad at all.
1660588	1670213	There's also a note on here that it's going to pretty much use standard DVDs, but as a slot loader, it will actually be able to take in the old GameCube discs.
1670494	1671034	Oh, okay, cool.
1672425	1684399	I think that that's actually pretty cool because the small discs, there hasn't been anything slot loading that would take those without some type of special tray to go with it.
1684419	1686762	The thing is that developers don't really know how to treat it.
1687423	1695213	They're talking about it being easy to program for though on a PC and you actually do more enhancements to it when you're porting it over.
1696475	1702243	But right now they've just been treating it like they're programming a GameCube game because the library is very similar.
1704285	1709047	Now, this whole news about the more powerful and stuff, it's all fine and good, but I'm not big on specs.
1709287	1715849	And I know a lot of our listeners are really big on specs, and they want to know exactly what the systems will do, but guys, remember the golden rule of gaming.
1715909	1716869	Everybody say it with me.
1717509	1721430	A system is only as good as the games that are on it.
1721490	1725851	So this thing could have rocket fuel, projection, lightning, laser, whatever.
1726992	1727732	If the games suck...
1728271	1728771	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1743872	1750000	That would be, I think, the smartest thing Nintendo could do if they were going to come in the market last, come in cheapest, make everybody else price slash.
1750080	1758049	What surprises me, though, is the fact that they'd go with the standard format DVD, because Nintendo has been all about having their own storage system.
1760115	1765138	They made their money on the 64 with those humongous cartridges they had.
1765198	1771601	See, I think part of the reason they lost with the GameCube, or at least came in last place in America with the GameCube, is because it didn't support DVDs.
1771661	1773903	And honestly... That's what pushed Square away.
1774143	1775083	I've said this before.
1775484	1781747	I think the reason why PlayStation 2 dominated the way it did is because people were buying them as DVD players.
1782347	1785529	Even though, you know, the first gen, they say you weren't supposed to, whatever.
1785933	1786353	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1809502	1811683	The backwards compatibility was a big thing.
1811883	1813743	However, I did find it very hilarious.
1813803	1817105	And I think that it's the Japanese one that had more issues with this than the U.S.
1817265	1817365	one.
1818065	1824147	Is that if you had on your texture smoothing, it would do very interesting things to some of the older games.
1824727	1830309	Like, I remember playing Bust a Move 2 with texture smoothing on, and Comet's head disappeared.
1831690	1832450	And one of her legs.
1833890	1836491	She can't really bust a move with only one leg now, can she?
1836531	1837832	Or without a head, yeah.
1837932	1838572	It was pretty funny.
1840110	1844832	Random, random, not related to anything comments, because we're talking about losing heads and stuff.
1844852	1847934	Somebody actually put a Photoshop in the MySpace, because you don't have people on MySpace.
1847954	1849894	They leave these comments that are just completely random.
1850455	1856517	One of my buddies actually put a comment on my MySpace that says, France, France, revolution, and it just shows the DDR cover with no head.
1856577	1857458	The head's on the ground.
1857538	1857838	Get it?
1857918	1859658	Because in France, they beheaded people.
1860019	1860759	Oh, what is that?
1862702	1863442	Something in the air tonight.
1863462	1864723	I think it was those brownies you brought over.
1864743	1866144	Are you sure those were Starbucks brownies?
1866404	1868085	They were Starbucks brownies.
1868165	1870946	They have caffeine in them and Starbucks makes you stupid.
1872968	1875889	We are never getting sponsorship from Starbucks.
1875929	1876389	Good job.
1876570	1877110	Good job on that.
1878090	1880872	I think now is a good time in the show to talk about...
1882296	1882837	DarkSakura.com
1910407	1912451	How to Survive a High-Rise Hotel Fire
1921055	1923416	Feel the hotel doorknob with the back of your hand.
1923937	1929540	If the knob is cool, open the door and escape via the nearest stairwell, keeping low with the hallway of smoke filled.
1929880	1931181	Duh.
1931201	1931181	2.
1931922	1935284	If the doorknob is hot, wedge wet towels under the door to keep smoke out.
1935704	1939206	Cover your head with wet towels and sheets to protect yourself from smoke inhalation.
1939606	1942488	You can also use the towel to signal rescue personnel at the window.
1943488	1942488	3.
1944029	1947531	If the air is getting worse, try to kick through the closet wall into the adjacent room.
1948297	1954181	Knock on the wall until you hear a hollow sound which indicates the absence of wall studs and then use both feet to kick through the drywall.
1954862	1956763	But my final piece of advice on this one?
1956963	1957184	Yes.
1957604	1964489	If you see a little sign outside the hotel that says now filming The Towering Inferno Part 2, stay somewhere else.
1965210	1966010	Good thoughts.
1966090	1969913	Or how about don't play with fire indoors?
1970293	1971454	Or unplug your Christmas tree.
1971955	1973796	Or stay in a hotel on the first floor.
1975477	1976138	Stay at Motel 6.
1977591	1978131	We had tiny rooms.
1978151	1978432	Anyway.
2002952	2003992	Loki, give us a story.
2004032	2004593	I don't care what.
2004653	2005593	Take us away from this.
2009474	2025539	On the topic of Crack Horse, we have... It was actually brought to everyone's attention again, this old mod that was out for the original Zelda, a ROM that's been floating around on the internet called Zelda Challenge The Outlands, and it's been...
2026604	2027004	DarkSakura
2043695	2043975	and so on.
2065902	2074227	The best worst mod I ever saw was an old Japanese game, it's called Nuts and Milk, and they never released it here for obvious reasons, because teehee nuts, right?
2074487	2079370	Well somebody actually went in and teehee nuts, they turned all the characters into, you know, nuts.
2080555	2085078	and the milk was, you know, that gross.
2085138	2097446	I downloaded Link's Awakening, the old Game Boy one, and I didn't find out until after I started playing it that it had been hacked, and his sword was like a dildo, and all the text had been changed.
2097506	2098146	That's so classy.
2099207	2103790	Anyways, this one has more dungeons, in fact, new weapons and whatnot.
2104430	2107352	Pretty cool, so you should go definitely check it out.
2107592	2108953	You can probably find it on the
2109505	2110926	Any ROM sites out there.
2111506	2113347	Zelda Challenge Outworld.
2113367	2115348	Alright, check that out.
2115388	2117149	DarkSakura, you have some news about Quake 4.
2117669	2118690	Yep, I sure do.
2119250	2120771	Little tiny piece of news.
2123612	2128735	Aspire has taken pity on Mac users.
2129615	2133497	Quake 4 will be coming out for the Mac next year, sometime.
2134258	2136899	It's going to be available for both PowerPC and Intel Macs.
2137674	2138635	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2164628	2167170	And actually, one of our listeners linked this to us.
2167310	2167790	Oh, super.
2168230	2170092	Our fabulous Robway.
2170692	2171352	Oh, of course.
2171613	2173214	Yes.
2173994	2180518	And it really goes into detail on these, but I'll just try to, I guess, summarize as best as I can.
2181979	2183020	Do you have a link to this?
2183060	2184641	Is this a quick link that you can read out?
2184661	2185502	Yeah, I can read it out.
2185602	2192807	It's pbs.org slash kcts slash videogamerevolution slash impact slash myths.html.
2193737	2195558	Okay, you might have to post that on the forums too, but that's interesting.
2195578	2197718	PBS, like public broadcasting system.
2197758	2198078	I guess.
2198219	2198679	Oh, interesting.
2198719	2198979	Okay.
2200279	2208242	But the first one is that the availability of video games has led to an epidemic of youth violence, and basically it's, like we talked about before, that's totally not the case.
2210022	2218745	In fact, the overwhelming majority, just to quote here, the overwhelming majority of kids who do not commit antisocial acts, they're talking about that...
2222035	2229980	All those reports that came back with some of our national facilities have proven that no, that's really not true.
2230000	2234582	Video games can be a very social thing sometimes.
2234602	2237004	Seriously, get a full game of Mario Party going.
2237577	2239518	You'll see more social... Forget it.
2239918	2240358	Go ahead.
2240578	2246761	Well, number two, Scientific Evidence links video games play with youth aggression.
2247782	2253884	But the studies that they've done have been really inconclusive.
2255005	2256946	Their methodology has been criticized.
2257966	2260047	They're not thorough research.
2261395	2270382	There's also, they're not accounting for, it's mentioned on here, the risk factor coupled with more immediate real world influences.
2271162	2279609	I mean, pretty much you learn violence is, I'd say it's actually a more instinctive human trait.
2280689	2289516	If somebody is going to be more prone to violent behavior, it's going to be a combination of home influence and biological predisposition.
2290316	2293159	3.
2290336	2293159	Children are the primary market for video games.
2303502	2306245	Most of the games marketed though are for the older gamer.
2306265	2307726	For almost no girls play video games, high bullshit.
2329442	2336330	5.
2329542	2336330	Because games are used to train soldiers to kill, they have the same impact on kids who play them.
2340215	2346223	Former military psychologist and moral reformer David Grossman argues that because the military uses games in training...
2347190	2350153	including, he claims, training soldiers to shoot and kill.
2350194	2356981	The generation of young people who play such games are primarily being brutalized and conditioned to be aggressive in their everyday social interactions.
2357482	2363609	Now this says his model only works if we remove training and education from a meaningful cultural context.
2364318	2368559	We assume leaders have no conscious goals and that they show no resistance to what they are being taught.
2368759	2369399	I'm sorry, learners.
2370140	2375221	We assume they unwittingly apply what they've learned in a fantasy environment to real world aspects.
2376701	2376841	No.
2378101	2379942	And I agree with the rest of this.
2379982	2389904	It's basically pointing out that the games for training military are specifically geared toward training and they know that it is geared toward their training.
2390665	2391945	For a child playing a game,
2392481	2393761	In their head, it's a game.
2393922	2395822	They don't have to go out and kill somebody the next day.
2396102	2398763	Let me throw this out there, just kind of a discussion item.
2399364	2400044	America's Army.
2402285	2404886	I think that that's more of an enlistment tool.
2406026	2408727	I know a lot of people that play this just for the game, though.
2408747	2410408	It had nothing to do with the enlistment aspect of it.
2410448	2412028	It's actually a really popular game.
2412048	2414049	It kind of has a very cult-like following to it.
2414869	2415789	I've got my copies.
2416010	2418570	I just thought I'd throw that out there because it's kind of a fusion of what you're talking about.
2418630	2419991	Any other of those bullet points you want to bring up?
2421405	2425587	Yeah, actually, no, I wanted to move on to the next one here.
2426127	2428669	Video games are not a meaningful form of expression.
2431770	2432810	What about Mario Paint?
2432911	2434751	I expressed a lot in that game.
2435912	2439594	Well, the thing is, is that not all games are violent.
2440134	2443736	We have, like, you're talking about Final Fantasy IV having a beautiful story.
2443876	2444236	Oh, yeah.
2444696	2448978	You know, that's just a really narrow-minded... You know, as far as, like, say, for example...
2449659	2453701	When you play The Sims, that's actually very expressive.
2453721	2455762	You control the people's lives in there.
2455822	2457983	You can have them interact.
2459144	2460704	What about your online games?
2461845	2463446	There's plenty of room for expression.
2464506	2468248	Oh, hell, MMOs are all about expression half the time.
2469489	2472190	Seven, video game play is socially isolating.
2472690	2473591	Hi, MMOs again.
2475742	2476962	We have friends over at our house.
2476982	2481345	Well, but that can go either way because some people can sit on an MMO all day long.
2481385	2490089	Of course, we've heard those horrible stories coming out of many different places about that folks die from forgetting to eat and drink from playing their MMOs all day.
2490189	2493791	So that can kind of go either way, but games don't.
2494981	2499725	Well, there's a comment on here that, in fact, I'll just read a little bit of it.
2500145	2500926	You're doing it all wrong!
2500986	2501646	Ha ha ha ha!
2518683	2519023	Smash Bros.
2542508	2549252	Video game play is desensitizing.
2549832	2557037	Classic study of play behavior among primates suggests that apes make basic distinction between play fighting and actual combat.
2559398	2559999	We're not monkeys.
2563311	2570934	But still, this is, I think that having the game here, and this actually mentions a little bit of this, that it's an outlet.
2575136	2582200	It can be used to let out this aggression that's within people so that you're better able to cope with the real world.
2582620	2588362	They're wanting to prove that playing a violent game makes you more violent outside.
2588622	2589663	Was this a TV show?
2590399	2591759	Because it's on PBS.org.
2591799	2592940	Was this a TV special?
2593240	2593480	I know.
2593620	2594020	It should be.
2594060	2594520	I don't think so.
2594640	2594920	It should be.
2594940	2595620	Yeah, I think it should be.
2595980	2598381	I think that it should be broadcast on every freaking channel.
2598401	2600541	There should be an episode of Penn & Teller's bullshit right here.
2601942	2602422	About video games.
2602442	2603582	It should be on 60 Minutes.
2604562	2605162	That's a good point.
2605262	2605502	Anyway.
2605882	2615805	But at any rate, you know, their whole argument with this one is that you would basically lose empathy for real world situations by experiencing them in a virtual environment.
2616585	2617085	Not the case.
2618152	2625838	In fact, by giving yourself an outlet in one forum, I think that it would make a person better able to cope in a real forum.
2628600	2632663	Interesting discussions that that article kind of invokes there.
2632703	2633944	So thank you for sharing with us.
2633964	2634664	That was a very good one.
2634704	2636326	Actually, we need to thank our buddy Rob.
2636566	2636806	All right.
2636846	2637887	Thank you, buddy Rob.
2639448	2642150	Loki, let's go from all that.
2642310	2643511	Let's talk about a good old war game.
2643731	2644672	Tell us about Gears of War.
2645762	2646262	Here's the worst.
2646362	2646883	Sexy.
2647203	2648204	That's all you need to know.
2648684	2656929	No, actually, they released some footage from, I believe it was Zero Hour, where they were showing off the game, and it's sexy.
2657910	2661352	This right here is the killer app for the 360.
2662873	2663414	Definitely.
2665115	2668557	What they did show is just the amazing graphics in it, as well as...
2670792	2673453	Kind of different things that they're doing with the storyline stuff.
2673513	2674053	It's really cool.
2676114	2680396	But that's one you're definitely going to be wanting to check out when it comes out.
2680416	2682537	I believe in April or March.
2683677	2684357	Alright, sounds good.
2685458	2688939	Let's go ahead and open up the old mailbag and see what our listeners have to say.
2689019	2698183	Remember guys, if you want to send us an email, all you've got to do is write us togoto at orangeloungeradio.com and DarkSakura will...
2699386	2700767	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2723980	2725241	Don't we have something on forums for that now?
2725261	2728082	That's why I made that thread.
2728142	2729002	Oh, good segue, good segue.
2729042	2736125	If you go onto our forums at orangeloungeradio.com, there is a link under console gaming.
2737325	2739326	I posted my friend code for Animal Crossing.
2740727	2743608	I haven't checked it lately, but we need to get more people on there.
2743976	2746076	When I go back to Animal Crossing, I'll post my friend code.
2746236	2747697	But for right now, I'm not fancy for it.
2747717	2749317	So you can come visit me in Danville.
2749797	2750777	Not Danville, Hades.
2750857	2751637	Dan with Danville.
2751798	2753078	I'll post my husband's too.
2753398	2754918	And Loki has OLR Town, right?
2755118	2756858	Yes.
2757079	2759319	You guys are doing Animal Crossing spam or something?
2760099	2761999	Yes, we're doing Animal Crossing spam.
2762100	2762720	Oh, that's great.
2762880	2766140	In fact, I'm going to open up a contest.
2766880	2767841	A little tiny contest.
2768481	2769581	If you get a bottle...
2771070	2781120	If from the ocean a message in a bottle that has Orange Lounge Radio written by me or Loki or Rob, then we'll send you a box of cookies.
2782001	2783623	Okay, you're buying those cookies and shipping them then?
2783643	2784564	I'll buy the cookies and ship them.
2784584	2784964	Alright, good.
2786045	2787927	They may be moldy by the time you get them, but I'll do it.
2789949	2790750	Anything else in the mail box?
2790870	2794414	If you live in another country, I'll send you cookies that you can only get here.
2795523	2796263	Girl Scout Cookies.
2796343	2796643	Delicious.
2796663	2797404	Girl Scout Cookies.
2797484	2797744	Alright.
2798224	2799024	Moving on.
2799204	2803846	What else?
2803866	2810208	We got a couple more listeners write in about the whole parental debate.
2810788	2813089	We actually got one person who didn't like our last episode.
2813849	2814029	Aww.
2814169	2815790	Because we talked about Animal Crossing too much.
2816070	2818071	Well, it's the game of the week.
2818091	2818831	What are you supposed to do?
2819451	2821532	Lots of people are playing Animal Crossing.
2821752	2822312	That's alright.
2822332	2822952	You're welcome to your pit.
2822972	2824113	We talk about other games too.
2824133	2824513	We try to
2825959	2829181	It just so happens that all three of us enjoy Animal Crossing, so it's going to come up.
2829241	2829862	All right, whatever.
2829882	2830622	That's fine.
2830642	2835405	And, you know, we got a few thank yous from some of the parents for reading the articles.
2835465	2843471	Actually, the one that I was very impressed with, Sloan that wrote us, that was a very, very good letter.
2843511	2852877	And he wrote back just to say that, you know, he actually, you know, felt he was good to hear, you know, us read the letter.
2853538	2853818	Also...
2854807	2855548	Thank you for watching!
2874031	2877534	But he gave us the okay to post that letter on the site.
2877674	2877894	Great.
2878174	2880456	So I will be doing that shortly within the week.
2880816	2881036	Great.
2881517	2883198	I've just been busy with finals.
2883218	2883778	That's fine.
2884679	2885520	Yeah.
2887161	2893786	And someone actually sent us an email as a Mac man.
2895367	2901612	So in response to playing copyrighted music on a podcast, as Gunn says, there isn't a crime if there isn't a law.
2903851	2904271	Hint, hint.
2924216	2933319	The last one is an article sent to us by our friend Sasuke.
2934459	2942322	In fact, I actually mentioned him in that other article I read via ex-Army Ranger and West Point psychology professor Grossman.
2943849	2945210	Lieutenant Colonel Dave Grossman.
2945570	2957096	Apparently he's been all in demand by law enforcement agencies talking about video game violence when, you know, there's proof that we don't have the situation.
2957676	2959377	Was this this other article you were going to talk about here?
2959457	2960938	You want to... Oh, okay, cool.
2961098	2962739	I was moving into it.
2962759	2963319	Just making sure.
2963639	2968261	You know, I was trying to be all smooth and ninja-like with my recording skills.
2968281	2968562	I'm sorry.
2968582	2970022	I'm scatterbrained tonight.
2971243	2973304	I can't get my mind off Actraiser and how beautiful it is.
2974181	2975101	We need a new Actriser.
2975541	2976642	I just, I said that.
2976862	2977362	Anyway, see?
2978242	2978882	Bad transition.
2978942	2979182	Anyway.
2979762	2982723	And anyway, he says that first person shooters are murder simulators.
2986164	2986604	You know what?
2986644	2987904	Didn't Jack Thompson say that?
2988185	2988805	I know.
2989125	2989465	I don't know.
2989525	2991145	I don't want to misquote somebody.
2991565	2992946	They're all screwing each other.
2993566	2993886	Anyway.
2996903	3003446	Anyway, it's just, and really, it's more of the same bullshit we've had spewed out of many, many people's mouths.
3004186	3006767	And my thought on all of this is, please shut up.
3007988	3010209	Y'all don't know what you're talking about.
3010349	3013350	It makes you sound like a big, stupid butthead.
3013450	3020953	All this hot coffee, seriously, if hot coffee really bothered you in 2005, it's time to switch to decaf in 2006.
3020993	3021333	Iced latte.
3023789	3024329	No decaf.
3024909	3025530	Or tea.
3025990	3026930	Go to tea.
3027070	3028211	Do some chai tea.
3028671	3028991	Loki.
3029291	3029631	Oh, I'm sorry.
3029651	3030411	Anything else in the mailbag?
3031252	3031872	No.
3032972	3033693	Lots of links from up.
3033853	3038575	To go at OrangeLoungeRadio.com and email us and love us.
3038955	3039275	Loki.
3039295	3040595	A couple things.
3041256	3046217	First, being that we're getting into a new year, what is one of the things you must do?
3046598	3047618	Get a new calendar.
3049161	3051721	Well, PSPMagazines.com has you covered.
3051741	3053122	But I don't want a new calendar.
3053282	3055522	Well, you can have a sexy new calendar.
3055642	3056262	Okay, never mind.
3056302	3061723	From ForHim Magazine or other sites.
3061843	3068304	They also have a calendar from ForHim Magazine, the 2006 PSP calendar featuring sexy babes.
3068364	3069664	A PSP calendar.
3070265	3072925	And the Maxim 2006 calendar.
3073305	3075806	These are actually four-year backdrops.
3076306	3078486	You can add them into your themes and stuff.
3080049	3080830	DarkSakura
3106386	3120169	On Monday the 19th, Nintendo of America's Executive Vice President of Sales and Marketing, Reggie Fils Ami, at 4 o'clock to 5.30 Pacific Time, you can actually get a chance to play him at Mario Kart DS.
3129803	3132847	If you get lucky and at 4 p.m.
3132927	3142636	Pacific Time start hammering the worldwide mode on your Wi-Fi and you might get lucky to go against NOA Reggie.
3144418	3145599	So, yeah.
3146140	3148702	How many fake NOA Reggies are going to be logged in though, I wonder?
3149973	3151113	Maybe they don't let you, I don't know.
3151193	3151853	I don't think they let you.
3151893	3159815	Anyways, although if you happen to live near Bellevue, Washington, he will be at the Bellevue Square McDonald's at that time.
3159855	3162675	You can actually meet him there and get some Nintendo swag as well.
3163935	3167856	Which just goes to show, executives dine on McDonald's once in a while too.
3167916	3173777	They have to get down and dirty with the rest of us and get their 99 cent menus and stuff.
3174017	3178998	Exactly, so I think that's pretty cool that they're doing that kind of stuff, so
3180461	3181201	Good luck, people.
3181601	3184623	I know a lot of the Snakers out there would like to go up against him.
3185703	3187143	Expose all the bugs in the game, please.
3187163	3191585	Apparently, this guy is really good at Mario Kart, so it should be interesting.
3191785	3192145	We'll see.
3193186	3194226	I know you had one other quick thing.
3194246	3195487	I want you to make sure you get all the stories out.
3195667	3198628	The thing about the Game Boy, the old-ass Game Boy?
3198668	3201829	That's all speculation and rumors, so I'm not going to really go into it.
3202309	3207431	Basically, the whole story was about the system that they're saying is going to be called Game Boy Evolution.
3207970	3213234	and how it's supposed to come out later and it's supposed to rival the PSP, yada yada yada.
3213274	3220040	This is stuff that's been in development since 2004 and since there's no actual firm information on it, it's all speculation.
3220100	3221061	I'm not even going to cover it.
3222461	3222942	Interesting.
3224223	3235914	I have a story here that talks about the biggest blockbusters of 2005 and it kind of coordinates with another story that you've probably seen around the internet talking about video game sales have fallen 18% this year.
3235954	3239398	And of course they're blaming that on no big blockbuster titles this year.
3239418	3240819	We did not have a Halo 2 this year.
3240839	3243241	We did not have a Grand Theft Auto San Andreas this year.
3243522	3244823	So they're saying that because of this,
3245444	3253451	Even with the Xbox 360, well, heck, not everybody who wanted to buy an Xbox 360 could get one, so video game sales on the whole have fallen a little bit.
3253732	3258837	This kind of doesn't surprise me, though, honestly, because we're sitting on the cusp of the next gaming generation.
3259297	3261580	This should be natural for the game sales to fall, right?
3261660	3266825	I don't know why this is such a shock, but what's interesting, I thought what's interesting, the top...
3268002	3271224	The top ten selling games of 2005 through November.
3271705	3274446	Only three of them actually released in 2005.
3275547	3283192	Madden, Madden Football, Gran Turismo 4, Pokemon Emerald were the only games released in 2005 to make the top ten list.
3283733	3290897	And hell, even Halo, released in 2001 on the original Xbox thanks to price cuts and things, number nine on the list.
3292158	3292698	Crazy, huh?
3292899	3294880	They're saying also part of the reason this is, you know...
3296065	3297586	The sales figures are not what they should be.
3298147	3301490	Most of the hugely anticipated games for 2005 bumped to 2006.
3302831	3307616	Kingdom Hearts 2, Final Fantasy XII, Zelda, Twilight Princess.
3308377	3310199	Everything got bumped, so what's left?
3310639	3316225	Exactly, and the other thing that's interesting to note is on the Xbox 360, they're live.
3316245	3318187	The number one game on there, Halo 2.
3320327	3320747	Interesting.
3322168	3329473	All right, now we're going to end tonight's show, but we're going to talk about some sexy things to end tonight's show, some sexy things for your Christmas season.
3329714	3331775	DarkSakura, you got a sexy MMO?
3332896	3335818	There's a porn company called Naughty America.
3336308	3337329	DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen
3364230	3370460	You can also though change your appearance by going to clothing stores, hair salons, tattoo parlor, plastic surgeon.
3371301	3375267	Didn't Yahoo Messenger just roll out the avatar thing where you can do the hair salon and everything?
3375888	3377531	There's some interesting correlations here.
3378703	3380524	But you've got different areas.
3380584	3384507	You have like downtown with your sex shops and video games.
3384527	3386268	Does Yahoo Messenger have the sex shops?
3386448	3387308	No, it doesn't.
3387408	3393772	Uptown, you've got outdoor cafes, casino, beach has boardwalks, swimming, poolside bars, goose trips.
3394012	3396134	Wasn't this just what Sims Online turned into?
3396154	3397434	I have no idea.
3397474	3401337	I heard some story a while back that Sims Online, because remember the Sims Online was supposed to be this huge thing.
3401597	3405639	Well, just like the real world, the Sims Online got corrupted by porn and casino and all that stuff.
3405699	3406520	And now it's just like,
3407819	3409981	But this one actually has sex mode.
3411262	3411462	Really?
3411482	3417588	Where you can invite another player on a date and engage in interpersonal activity.
3417608	3418589	Some hot coffee.
3419870	3421291	Can you invite them over for some hot coffee?
3421411	3426496	Wasn't there a game that we saw over by the folks that did Xtango?
3426576	3429158	Yeah, um... Feel 3.
3429318	3431320	Feel 3, thank you, that's a game.
3431360	3433562	Where you actually broke the demo and had them...
3434306	3437547	Yeah, you actually got... Loki did so good on the demo.
3437587	3442888	Somebody actually had to come by and put their hand up on the monitor because this person was starting to show too much.
3443868	3444948	I think I got a picture of that.
3444968	3446549	It should be up on our E3 picks.
3446629	3447809	I know, it's somewhere in the gallery.
3447969	3449149	No, no, no, no, no!
3449169	3450750	No, no, no, no, no!
3451190	3452250	I think it was the last day.
3453490	3454131	I remember that.
3454211	3457471	I should have taken that as my cue to start clicking like hell.
3459412	3460272	That was hilarious.
3462547	3465149	Didn't one of us ask them if there would be dude-on-dude action?
3465809	3465969	Yeah.
3466349	3467850	I think you or me asked about that.
3467970	3469191	One man played woman.
3470151	3472712	We asked about that, like, could the game go there?
3472953	3473833	And they told us no.
3474853	3477195	They didn't understand, I don't think, what we were asking.
3477835	3479416	Can you be gay in this game?
3480236	3481057	Can you be cowboys?
3481177	3482797	Can you both dress up as cowboys?
3482877	3484138	He said, boy play woman.
3484898	3485239	Single.
3485279	3486719	That's what he said.
3486819	3488000	I remember that now, that's right now.
3490197	3492559	I delegate my assignment to Loki.
3492579	3499383	The only thing that this does not have that Feel 3 does is USB accessories to go with it
3520259	3523481	Yeah, Feel 3 had attachments.
3524001	3525002	Like the Rez vibrator?
3525022	3526222	The trance vibrator?
3526302	3528464	Yeah, but this thing wasn't a trance.
3528704	3530645	I'm still looking for one of those, by the way.
3531085	3532206	I finally found a copy of Rez.
3532226	3532946	Okay, TMI, honey.
3533547	3534607	No, no, no, no, no, no.
3535848	3538449	Just to see if it's really as awful as they say it is.
3538489	3540610	And I'm not going to use it for that, you perv.
3542792	3543752	I have a sexy story.
3544513	3546174	Actually, I don't know if this is sexy or not.
3547594	3548395	Craigslist...
3548973	3550433	which should say it all right there.
3550473	3554595	If you want to see some real nasty stuff, Craigslist is the place for you to be.
3554635	3555975	Just check out some of the personals on there.
3556015	3557235	Not that I know firsthand or anything.
3557575	3562217	However, there were some posts on Craigslist in the Boston area.
3562777	3566118	There was a young woman there that was willing to trade sex.
3566880	3568481	for an Xbox 360.
3568561	3573645	She also was describing a female, talking about a little menage a trois action.
3573665	3576747	If you don't know what I mean by that, ask your parents.
3577527	3577887	No, don't.
3579969	3582330	It has to be a premium bundle.
3582410	3587954	These guys only want premium bundles for their sexual encounter.
3589545	3592427	However, the post was removed, just so you guys know.
3592447	3597049	The post was removed from Craigslist, but not before millions of nerds on the internet had a good laugh at it.
3598150	3599871	The post was removed because she was a sea donkey.
3604874	3612338	And apparently some gaming journalists actually tried to write the person an email to see if this person was serious, and maybe that's why it got removed.
3612458	3613139	I have no idea.
3613799	3614359	But anyway...
3616866	3620927	Some people are willing to go to great lengths to get that Xbox 360 before Christmas.
3621007	3623508	DarkSakura, you're pointing at something and going, oh my god, oh my god.
3624569	3628830	As I typically do, check VGCats, which is one of my favorite webcomics.
3629550	3632011	It's all Animal Crossing and everybody needs to look at today's.
3632871	3635312	You talk about Animal Crossing too much on this show, DarkSakura.
3636012	3636473	Oh no!
3636793	3637913	I'm taking that game away from you.
3638013	3638333	Alright.
3638553	3639094	No!
3639474	3640314	We gotta wrap up.
3640354	3640934	We gotta wrap up.
3642255	3644795	We gotta go around and get everybody's final thoughts so we can call it a night.
3644875	3646396	Loki, your final thought.
3647347	3647788	I'm tired.
3648690	3649872	DarkSakura, your final thought.
3650152	3652336	Reject false icons and get rid of the plague for me.
3653078	3655021	My final thought is Boy Play Woman.
3655742	3656484	Boy Play Woman!
3657737	3658457	We'll see you next week.
3658477	3659998	Yes, we are going to do a show next week.
3660078	3669724	Even though it's Christmas, we're going to find some time to pre-record a show, maybe talk about some of the year's best, or at least our favorite for the year, and all sorts of other year-end things you would come to expect.
3670144	3673526	Thank you, as always, for giving a crap and listening to our show.
3673566	3676848	We really appreciate it, especially when we're indie and all that stuff.
3677209	3678169	We really appreciate it.
3678669	3682532	I want to give a shout-out real quick to our buddies over at GamePolitics.com.
3683192	3686033	because we kind of dropped the ball on something we said we were going to do for them.
3686193	3687953	We kind of weren't able to do it because of the plague.
3688693	3693335	So we want to say hi and sorry and go visit Game Politics because they're a great site.
3693395	3696796	Happy holidays, and we hope that your next year is drama-free.
3696976	3697396	That's right.
3697676	3697976	All right.
3699236	3701357	Have a good one, and we'll see you next week.
3701557	3701837	Okay?
3702137	3702397	Bye-bye.
3704384	3707948	That's the end of another Orange Lounge Radio To Go edition.
3708268	3713774	This podcast is a proud part of www.orangeloungeradio.com.
3714215	3715236	See you next update.
