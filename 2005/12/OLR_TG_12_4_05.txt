Hello everybody out there in podcasting land.
or whatever your hometown happens to be.
Do you think there's actually a town out there named Podcasting Land?
Probably not.
Well, there's Dish, Texas, so why not?
Why not?
I'd move to Podcasting Land.
You're listening to Orange Lounge Radio To Go.
My name is Rob Roberts.
You might know me as Sky.
Joining me as always, the one and only Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers.
Hi.
How are you?
I still have the plague.
But you sound better.
Have you had lots of liquid Vicodin and codeine and all that good stuff?
I drank codeine before the three hour show.
Awesome.
And I get to go home to sleep with Prince Vicodin.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
But sometimes we do have to talk about a couple games that do suck, or has been the trend lately, movies based on games that kind of suck.
Such as BloodRayne.
Seen the trailer for BloodRayne?
I'm actually going to see it.
Why?
Why?
That's like $10 wasted.
Because there's pretty men in it.
There's also pretty prostitutes that are naked.
I'm Candy!
You are both being vapid and superficial.
Listen, I have to watch Alone in the Dark and I also have to watch House of the Dead before I see BloodRayne because I have to understand what I'm getting myself into.
You have to complete the poop trilogy is what you have to do.
House of the Dead was funny.
And awful.
and what was it?
In the name of the king, a dungeon siege movie blows ass is what the trailer sucked.
Burt Reynolds looks really bored.
Well, anyway.
Probably weren't paying him enough.
Before we got into that topic, we're supposed to talk about what kind of games we've been playing this week because that's how we start off the show, a little bit of a personal touch because, damn, we're important.
Or at least we'd like to think we are.
DarkSakura, who is most important.
What have you been playing this week?
What kind of games have you been playing this week?
Well, like, that's hard.
I've been really not playing much of anything because I've had the plague again all week, which is fun, but in a not really sort of way.
However, for my husband's birthday, which was Tuesday, we got him an Xbox 360.
Oh, right on.
We've had days filled with Perfect Dark Zero, which is gorgeous.
The new Ridge Racer is really, really nice.
He's also been really into Project Gotham.
Although for some reason he was playing Liberty City Grand Theft Auto on the PSP today.
I heard it's a decent game, you know.
Also, I got to see, actually, the new Madden game, which was nice, if you like Madden.
Yeah, I'm not a big sports game fan, but the game looked pretty.
But you know what?
If I want to play football, give me some Tecmo Bowl.
The new NBA 2006?
That actually looks kind of fun.
You know, the most sports games I've enjoyed have been basketball.
I mean, there's NBA Jam.
Loved NBA Jam back in the day.
Double Dribble.
NBA Jam was great.
You know, of course, these are all like 15-year-old games.
Yeah, NBA Jam was a good game.
Thanks to EA, you can never have another NBA Jam.
Well...
They can go to hell.
But I do have to say that Mike Bibby did not look like himself in that game.
That was a very bad version of him.
However, Art Corvino looked very nice, because of course the first game Dan did was Lakers vs. Kings.
Of course, as most people in this area would do.
Whatever.
I did play some more Katamari just because and of course it made me uber motion sick because I've been sick anyway.
I turned on World of Warcraft again and then promptly left the room.
Why is that?
I forgot about it.
I had to do something and I came back.
Oh, World of Warcraft.
Something shiny.
That's my shiny thing.
And I just haven't had... You know, I've also had to go back to school and work and... Well, Animal Crossing this week.
Are you going to make some time for it?
I know you're doing Animal Crossing.
Oh, hell yeah.
My breaks are no longer going to be spent on my book.
They're going to be spent on playing Animal Crossing.
There you go.
Me, you, bike racks, 3 o'clock, bring your bug net.
That's all I have to say.
Oh, hell yeah.
It's on.
Just wait until I put some signs in your village.
Alright, Loki, what's on your mind?
As far as games goes, I don't care about what else is on your mind, I just want to know games.
Well, I've been playing Grand Theft Auto Liberty City Stories, the usual by workday game that we play.
I've been kicking the crap out of everybody because I fucking rock.
And then also I've been playing Matrix Path of Neo, and that was pretty cool.
It's actually a lot...
and so on.
This is a pretty well done game, and I like how you can select your difficulty in the beginning, how it just gets progressively harder, and then you select it off of that.
I don't like the fact that the cameras are really slow.
Like, you change the camera around, it moves too slow, and I can't get it to go faster, and so I get a lot of awkward camera shots with that.
I don't know, it's pretty good, and then it gets really hard.
Really hard, really fast.
Like,
I think I saw a story over on Dig or something about that game.
What's this all about?
It's a free game that's put out.
You can go to the website www.cloudthegame.com
And it's supposedly a game that's supposed to make you cry, I guess.
Wait, this game's going to make me cry?
Supposedly.
Why?
I guess because the content, I think it talks about some kids... Is it going to chop onions live in front of me?
Or is it going to show me hideous images from the things in our history and stuff?
Going to play Politary on repeat.
Let's see here.
And actually, maybe it isn't cloudthegame.com, but I have the link right here.
It's a pretty fun game.
Definitely worth checking it out, especially since it's a free download.
You can't really go wrong with that.
But yeah, it's actually thatcloudgame.com.
Thatcloudgame.
Not to be confused with Final Fantasy VII Cloud.
It's created by the Game Innovation Group.
Um, students from Game Innovation who created, and it's a division of Interactive Media at University of Southern California School of Cinema and Television.
Um, and it's actually...
Pretty awesome.
They've got a little FAQ here about it.
And it's just, it's a really well done game.
It's kind of fun.
It's kind of like Katamari and it's more of a puzzle game.
It's free and it's pretty.
What else do you need to know?
It's relaxing.
It's not, there's not really any time limits or anything.
It's just kind of, you build clouds, you start off, you gather clouds and you can kind of suck them up and then you can kind of spit them back out again.
and create, like, taller clouds to pick up even bigger clouds and then you can make stuff rain and stuff like that.
Okay, I'm still not driven to tears here.
Well, I don't know what it is, but, um, it's just, it's a cool game, so thatcloudgame.com, go check it out.
If you have cried playing Cloud the Game, I seriously want to hear from you.
2go at orangelandradio.com.
I seriously want to know what's so freaking sad about this game.
I don't know, it's...
It's kind of got the sad music into it, and it's got, like, in the very beginning, it's talking about this kid who stopped taking his meds, and so you kind of get the feeling maybe he's dead or something like that.
Okay, that's kind of sad.
Most gamers have cold black hearts after playing Doom 3 for hours on end, you know, so what?
I don't know.
But it's well done.
The art's really good in it.
It runs on almost, you know, most PCs nowadays.
It doesn't require, like, a huge graphics card or anything, so...
I would definitely check it out.
Thank you for watching!
But there are some of the games I want to check out that are coming out, including Animal Crossing this week.
Final Fantasy 4 Advance, which I believe is this week or was last week.
I think it's this week.
Yeah, it's very, very soon.
I know that.
And that's pretty much all that's on my must-play list between now and Christmas.
Otherwise, I'll just kind of check things out as I play them or come across them.
They look cool.
Otherwise, for me, honestly, it's been a lot of Dragon Quest VIII, which I talked about last week already.
Great game.
I'm loving it.
It's an old-style RPG, and it's what I remember from the great Super Nintendo.
It kind of is a throwback to the Super Nintendo RPGs.
It's holding my attention.
And that's pretty much it.
I've got just a lot of stuff going on in my personal life, so I can't do a lot of games this week.
But next week, for sure, Animal Crossing and probably Final Fantasy.
I will definitely be all up on that.
Let's get into some gaming news, shall we?
Speaking of things that are like 15 years old, I know this is an odd thing to lead off as a top story, but damn, this was so weird.
Loki, you've got to tell me about what you saw in this message form about a chip that's very old.
What is going on with this?
Well, at Benhek.com, because you've got to love that stuff, they were talking about how they've overclocked the Super FX chip.
And for those who might not remember, that's the chip that was in
Those wonderful 3D games, you know, back in Star Fox and Stunt Race FX.
Off-road, yeah.
Oh, no.
There was an off-road game that had it, too.
I think there was another driving game.
I don't remember.
Yeah, Stunt Race FX was that stupid, stupid, stupid game.
Maybe I'm getting it confused.
Anyways, a bunch of other stuff.
And what they've done is there's a timing chip that's on this actual, you know, rip the card apart and actually look at the circuit board.
And what they've done is replace that with a different chip.
And...
What that has done is actually now things are moving faster, it's less lag, so when they get to a scene with lots of enemies in the background, it does not slow down, just better frame rate and stuff, which is kind of neat, because you've got to love everybody hacking stuff.
I don't know.
This is weird that this is so old, yet people are still messing with this stuff.
This is kind of neat, diehard fan stuff.
If I wasn't afraid, I would screw up my Super Nintendo.
Honestly, I don't even have a working Super Nintendo anymore.
If I wasn't afraid, I would screw up a valuable Star Fox cartridge by doing this.
It almost sounds like fun.
Well, except that you can find them for $2 at the thrift store.
I thought they were worth more than that.
Well, crap.
They are, but if you look at the thrift store, they'll sell... Really?
Well, you know, I see copies of, what was it, Casey Munchkin?
Uh-huh.
On some of those auctions selling for a little bit more.
Yeah.
I bought my copies, several of them, for $0.99 at the thrift store.
Oh, yeah, because they don't know the real value of that stuff.
Exactly.
Yeah, and people who just donate bags and bags.
Interesting.
Alright, let's talk about some news going on with Final Fantasy XII, DarkSakura.
What do you know about what's going on with the release in Japan?
Well, I know they're planning on charging a bit more for it.
Typically, PS2 games retail for about 7,410 yen.
However, they're saying that the launch price is going to be 8,990 yen.
Ouch.
Which is about, yeah, 85, 86 bucks.
Wow.
But games are typically more expensive in Japan anyway, right?
That's not a big deal.
Yeah, but... But if you're going to import this, you're going to be paying that.
They're popping the price up on that one.
Wow.
Just for conversion's sake, that's about 43 pounds.
Amazing.
Now, do you think that's going to have an effect on the release here?
Do you think that we're going to end up paying a real high-end price such as $59.99 for this?
Well, Squinnix hasn't commented on anything, but I'm thinking it's probably going to be a likelihood.
At least bank on $49.99 if nothing else.
DarkSakura.com
Now did you hear about this?
When they release this in Japan on March 16th, actually Squeenix teamed up with somebody called Suntory who makes these drinks, these basically herbal drinks.
They're going to release Final Fantasy XII Potion.
They're these blue crystal drink looking things that are basically...
Like, you know the power drinks we have here in America, the Buku and the Rockstar and Red Bull being probably the most popular of them all.
It's basically something like that, except they say this will be a mysterious flavor, the potion, and will be made from various herbs.
And of course they're going to do all these lame tie-ins about, you know, it'll regenerate your HP with all the herbal goodness.
Wah, wah, wah.
Stuff like that.
I don't know, you think that's something that could work over here?
Final Fantasy Potion?
Well, looking at the ingredients in it though, hyssop and lemon balm, they are, okay, I worked at GNC for a very long time and an herb shop.
Yeah, those are fairly sedative herbs.
I'd have to see the ingredient list, the full list, but I would buy it.
You know, instead of having an energy drink, why not have a drink that relaxes you?
I think it's a good idea.
Although I don't think I need my HP to go up anymore.
Even though I have the plague.
This will be the rage at anime conventions.
Seriously.
The kid who imports a case of this, if they don't end up releasing it here, a kid who imports the case of this will be the most loved at the anime conventions.
I got my potion.
It had the thing about the premium box bundle, right?
With the specially designed bottle and the Final Fantasy XII art museum card.
Very cool.
Loki, what do you think?
Potion?
Good thing?
Bad thing?
I'm not buying it.
I don't buy those energy drinks anyway.
It's not an energy drink.
It's a calming drink.
Well, whatever.
I still buy that stuff.
If it's got herbs in it, forget it.
When they release a drink called Ether, wake me up.
Moving on.
Other stories.
What's going on with WoW?
We were talking about hacking the Super FX.
What's being hacked in World of Warcraft, Jamie?
Well we have SUPER HOT XXX NUDE ORCS!
Yeah, someone basically hacked it to have all the female characters, orcs, humans, gnomes, night elves, dwarves, trolls, undead, whatever, get naked.
But Blizzard's probably going to be, of course, cracking down on that one, so the only way you can get it would probably be on a private server.
You knew this shit would happen eventually.
It's because people are perverts.
Release a video game for the computer with a woman in it, and somebody will get her naked.
Troll boobies!
There's nothing they can do.
There's nothing they can do.
Well, especially when WoW is so patch-friendly anyway.
I mean, mine is bogged down with all these patches like the Oct...
that show you how long estimated to get to your next level and just all this crap on there that makes the game take forever to load.
But since Blizzard is so friendly at supporting this stuff, whereas other games, Final Fantasy XI, do not support these things, it kind of makes it easier for these types of patches to go into effect.
People have been modding Final Fantasy XI to do this already.
It's not a surprise.
I'm just saying.
Blizzard kind of embracing it makes it...
Smash Bros.
The creator of the Smash Bros.
series has said in the latest issue of the Japanese Game Bible Famitsu, what's going to happen is that Mashihiro Sakurai is actually coming back to Nintendo after being gone for two years, saying that he will be doing a new Super Smash Bros.
game for the Revolution, to which many Nintendo fanboys are cheering.
I think this was kind of a given that there would definitely have to be some type of Smash Bros.
on Revolution.
One word...
Pit from, actually no, there's four words, Pit from Kid Icarus.
Okay, thanks.
We need Pit.
Absolutely.
Or Eggplant Wizard.
Yeah, I was going to say we need Eggplant Wizard.
We know who we need, actually.
We need us a Mega Man.
But that's not Nintendo, that's Capcom.
That's true, that's Capcom.
Well, then we need somebody to make friends at Capcom.
I don't know why, well, I was just, I had it in my head, though, thinking, it was another character I'm trying to think of that was, I don't know, what if we have Nintendogs?
They come out as helpers.
Dalmatians start ripping Mario flesh.
Oh, God.
All right.
Oh, no, ammonia burn.
Or Animal Crossing.
K.K.
Slider comes and whacks you with his guitar.
We need Rob the Robot.
One of the weapons you get is a power glove.
Lame, lame, lame.
No way.
Let's talk about some games that are coming out like within this.
Oh, actually, no.
Before we get to that, Nintendo in the UK is doing something kind of interesting.
Well, there are downloadable ringtones available.
That is if you are a member of their little club thing.
They have the Nintendo VIP 24-7 Club.
You'll be able to, after December 5th, you will be able to turn in your stars that you've collected to buy ringtones from the Nintendo of Europe website.
They said they've got 20 to choose from.
There's The Legend of Zelda, Metroid Prime, Super Mario Bros.
They say there are 350 stars each.
But there's also mobile wallpapers too at 150 stars apiece.
They're saying though that you...
Have to update your user profile by entering in your mobile number, your phone's makeup model.
You basically follow the instructions.
Kind of similar to what they do on the US side because I actually finally signed up for the US Nintendo thing because, you know, with the new console coming out and the DS Wi-Fi, I kind of wanted to get on board with whatever promotional things they might be doing.
So I went and I pulled all my DS games and I registered them all with Nintendo's site.
So hopefully I'll get some free crap.
I don't know.
We'll see.
Yeah, I remember when I did that, you know, back in the day when they were giving away that Zelda, you know, where it's the Zelda 1 and 2 and then... You didn't get shit, did you?
No, I didn't get shit.
And I qualified for it, and they said they were going to send it, and they didn't send it, so... Aw, maybe somebody stole it.
Maybe I stole it, because you were living with me at the time.
No.
All right.
Well, they're also, though, they've just launched a new WAP portal for your mobile.
You go to wap.nintendo.co.uk.
Saken Densetsu DS
Estimated $42 when you convert the dollars over there.
No stateside release announced yet, but honestly guys, I think it's pretty much a given that this game will be making its way over here.
I would guess maybe next summer, next Christmas, I think is a fair guess.
Who knows?
It's all up to Squeenix on whatever they want to do.
But for those of you guys who like to import, you can do that on February 23rd, this latest entry from Japan.
Loki, you have something that a lot of gamers might want on their wish list this Christmas.
If you got about, what, $800, $1,000 to spare to get arcade games in your home, what's this about?
Less than that.
Oh, wow.
Oh, good.
Yeah, first off, there's a couple places you can get arcade games.
One of them being at Costco, and they're selling kind of a better package, but it's for about, I think, $2,000.
You can get a full-size...
I'm sorry, $2,299.
You get a 2006 Ultimate Arcade stand-up unit.
Now, I'm not going to be confused with the Ultimate Arcade, you know, cabinet, which is something, like, I built for mine.
But anyways, it comes with 81 games, all from Atari and others, including Golden Tee and stuff.
It's covered in, like, different logos, like Capcom and stuff, which is kind of odd seeing as there's all Atari games in there, but...
Huge list of stuff.
Now, if you're not looking to spend $2,300 on something, Target has something more of your price.
Their cabinet, which sports a whopping 12 games, all from Midway, is $397, which is not bad for a game.
Yeah, considering that you could probably gut that thing and do something else with it, not a bad price.
Yeah, that's not a bad price if you want to gut it.
Now, granted, it is a little bit tiny, but it includes such wonderful things as Joust, Defender, 1-2, Robotron, Rampage,
Blatt, Satan's Hollow, Root Beer Tapper, Bubbles, Wizards of War, Timber, and Sinistar.
You know, hats off to Midway.
They know how to milk their old shit.
They really do.
Sinistar is awesome.
They know how to get the most out of their old stuff.
DarkSakura.com is the place to send those emails.
And we'll read them and respond to them when we feel like it.
No, just kidding.
DarkSakura always...
XBOX 360
A USB adapter.
Oh, the wireless thing.
Right.
I heard about this.
Kind of taken a good idea from the Nintendo DS, honestly.
But hey, hey, it works.
Apparently what you can do with this, you can hook up a USB hard drive to your 360.
Oh, interesting.
Okay.
Let's see, it says on the actually linked website, all you need is the following, a hard drive of your choice.
It says the drive is not important as long as you can get a USB 2.0 adapter for that type of drive.
And then a USB 2.0 to ATA adapter for the type of drive you will be using.
That's pretty neat stuff.
Interesting.
Also, in other email here, as soon as I get back to...
Reach my hand back in the bag.
A little bit about the... That's not the mailbag.
Dot, dot, dot.
Go ahead.
ESRB is up to their old crap again.
Yay.
Well, that's a good thing, though, because they've got to fend off all this other stuff going on, right?
In a way?
Kind of?
Maybe?
Well, they posted an article here.
Just...
ESRB Game Retailers Decried Bad Report Card
Ratings Education C+, Retailers Policies B, Retailers Enforcement D-, Ratings Accuracy F, Arcade Survey B-, and
The only reason they got that F in ratings accuracy is because that Grand Theft Auto thing slipped through.
And I still say to this day, Rockstar did not intend for that to get out.
It was a lazy programming thing.
It was a lazy programming thing.
It's a common programming thing.
That they never thought they would have to do.
Huh?
But there was just, you know, I love this comment here.
Parents exercising responsibility by not buying games intended for 17 year olds for their 10 year old.
F. Huh.
Definitely need to be on there.
You know.
I'm going to go ahead.
This article is actually on the Ars Technica website.
It really needs to be given a read by many of our listeners.
It's a pretty lengthy article.
It goes into a lot of details.
But I do think that it makes a pretty good point with the points going back and forth between the different facilities that are arguing about
You know, for the ratings or against the ratings or how effective they are.
You know, I honestly think that the ratings themselves are pretty accurate, I would say.
It's just the fact that parents just don't look.
They don't care.
Interesting.
You know, this is going to tie into a story I have coming up as soon as you're done with mail.
Okay.
Is that it?
Was that it for mail?
No.
No?
Okay.
No.
Okay.
There's also another one he linked about 400,000 Xbox 360s being sold.
What?
Really?
They have to be stacking those numbers.
Is that how many they really put out on shelves?
Is that maybe 400,000 worldwide?
No, they're estimating 400,000 launched in the US, 300,000 in the UK.
Wow.
I don't know, it just seems like nobody I know has one.
So, maybe a couple people online I know, but nobody I know has one, whereas everybody I know has PS2s, well, whatever, who cares.
It's just a launch.
And you know, this crap about them not having the systems, I'm sorry, that's so much utter crap.
How so?
Just because...
I don't know how fast they're manufacturing, or maybe it's because they're trying to manufacture them so quick is why they're such, you know, kind of bad quality.
You know, why so many of them are having issues.
Even, you know, my Xbox has issues.
It froze like three times while we were playing Ridge Racer 6.
This is why I'm glad I decided to wait a little bit.
Maybe they'll work some of this stuff out in 2006.
I don't know.
We're probably going to end up, I don't know, trading ours in...
DarkSakura.com
Yeah, I want to wait for actual numbers.
I don't buy this estimate thing.
Alright, anything else?
There were a few others, but we'll go ahead to whatever you had.
Talk about this bill that they are going to propose when Congress reconvenes in two weeks.
It's the Family Entertainment Protection Act, and it will pretty much be suggesting that we govern a few things.
Step one, basically that it's going to be trying to get businesses to not sell a mature adults-only or ratings-pending game to a person who's younger than 17.
First thing I should note is that this bill
contrary to the California bill that was passed under the bills, actually embraces the ESRB rating system and sort of uses that as the guide as to what they consider mature and what's not.
And for that, I kind of say I applaud this bill where other bills I think have kind of failed is that the other bills made it, at least the California one that I was pretty familiar with, made it way too vague what exactly a mature game is.
This makes the board do it, which I think is kind of interesting.
Step two calls for mandated yearly review.
Okay, step three, the FTC, Federal Trade Commission, can conduct an investigation when misconstances happen, as they will do with Grand Theft Auto, San Andreas, to see if it was done purposefully, which I do truly believe they will find it was not.
Okay.
Step four, consumers can file complaints with the Federal Trade Commission when they disagree.
And then the FTC would also be audited regularly to make sure that the ESRB is doing their job and everything.
I actually, although I do believe the bottom line is that
Thanks for watching.
See you next time.
Everything is running as it should be, and I don't think that's necessarily a bad thing.
So I'm not so much on the doom and gloom page as everybody else is on with this.
Although I do understand the argument that, you know what, why don't parents just frickin' read the labels?
I find it disgusting that we've had to come to this.
That, first of all, there's not as much honesty, I think, in the marketing of some of these games.
You know...
I don't think they're particularly hiding their content, you know?
But I also don't think that they are 100% accurate about the level of some of the things that are in some of the games and are hiding behind the rating system to see what they can eek past.
It's how movies do.
Well, true, true.
I think there should be consistency between games and movies, though, and I've said that a long time ago.
I think they should be using the same rating system.
But I think that if it is proven that the actions of a child are based directly off of an event in a video game, their parents need to be held liable for neglect, for being negligent in what their children are doing.
It is not the job of the government, nor is it the job of video game companies to decide what children play.
It is the job of the parent to censor what their children look at.
and where me myself you know I know when I have kids I'm gonna you know I basically got to look at whatever I wanted to when I was younger and I grew up fine and responsible because I grew up prepared for it that's how I feel I know that that's how I'm going to be with my children if they do something bad as a result of a game they don't get to play the game anymore
Demon Spawn!
Just kidding.
but um I think that I feel very strongly that it's the job of the parent to ultimately decide if their child's going to be allowed to have something and I think that if their child is going behind their back and getting these games or trading with their friends and parents need to say no you're going to give me that and we're taking it back
They need to, you know, and I know kids are going to hide stuff and try to get away with stuff.
You know, I was that way when I was a kid.
I don't know what child didn't try to get something past their parents at some point or another.
And parents, please do not lie to me and say that your children are perfect angels because we know what kids are like.
We were all kids once, right?
We were all there.
You know, no child is going to be perfectly well behaved and even if it looks like they're perfectly well behaved, you know damn well they're trying something behind your back.
It's the nature of being a kid.
You have to go through your rebellious phase and then you grow out of it.
Part of growing up.
But still, I digress.
I really do think that it, you know, and I know that not all parents are like this.
Not all of them are really irresponsible, but I have met plenty who are.
All the ones that you see on television who are like, my child, my mom, my dad, my mom.
It's their fault.
Seriously, go observe at a GameStop or an EB game sometime.
Just kind of lurk in the corner and kind of listen to some of the counter conversations between parents and kids.
It is amazing.
It is amazing some of the stuff you would hear.
I mean, it is.
Oh my gosh.
Wow.
I don't think enough parents take...
enough of an active role in their children's upbringing.
And I understand being busy.
I know right now I would not be in a position to have a child.
As long as I'm working full-time and going to school, I am damn not having a child.
And I think that there are too many parents out there who are not dedicating the time they need to make sure that their children are doing what they should be, playing the right kind of game.
They're letting the game to babysit their children.
Well, I'm sure we're going to get some emails on that.
I welcome them.
I really want to discuss it.
2go at orangeloungeradio.com is the email.
Loki, though, what's your thought?
I'm going to let my kids just... They're only going to be able to play Grand Theft Auto on that.
That's it.
You're doing like an experiment.
No, screw that.
There's no experiment.
Why do we need to do this anyways?
This is all Hillary Clinton's fault.
And you know why?
Yes, it is.
You know why?
Because she wants some sort of platform so she can campaign for fucking president.
That's what it is.
And I can tell you this much.
We don't need that.
Because why?
For one, we don't have any sort of laws saying that a child under 17...
I agree that if this is going to be against the law, then it should be against the law.
The theater should be held responsible when a kid sneaks into an R-rated film, which is something we all did when we were kids.
And besides, it's... Who snuck?
I just went.
It's going to be just, you know...
It's still going to be the same problem.
So what, you make it against the law for a kid to buy the game.
Okay, big deal.
The parents are buying the games for the kids anyway, so what's the matter?
I mean, you've solved nothing.
I honestly, though, have to say that I'm highly embarrassed to have Hillary Clinton as a representative of my gender.
Well, that's... I don't think it's as bad as people are making it out to be.
I think that... I kind of agree with what you're saying.
It's kind of sad that it's come to this, but I think that this bill is much better than bills in the past.
I think there's merit to this.
If they have to have one, then this one is more well thought out, I think.
And so I can't say that Hillary Clinton's a bitch because, you know, I think it's...
I give her credit for saying, okay, we have this ESRB, but the problem with it is it's regulated by the industry, so let's have the government regulate it, and then we could use this.
I think it's the best idea.
I'm sure I'll get an email or two on it.
I'm sure.
And have they solved the problems with pirates out there?
No.
Oh, that's right.
Maybe they should just focus on that and not on these two ratings.
Jack Sparrow is coming back.
Haven't you seen the trailer?
Yeah.
I'm hilarious.
But seriously, folks.
I would like to receive the email.
I would love to hear from other parents, especially just on a personal note since, again, like I said, I'm planning on spawning soon.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
There is a very high degree of responsibility with the companies for what they market, but I strongly believe still that the ultimate power is in the hands of the parents.
And I assure you this, I will be emailing Senator Clinton and Senator Lieberman's office trying to get an interview.
And it probably won't happen, but I will email and try and allow them to present their perspective on the show if they so choose.
And I'd like to voice my opinion to the industry.
We need more games with TNA.
Because there's a lot more violent games out there.
Not enough nudity.
Well, you know, maybe having a bunch of nudie games will be like stress relief instead of insight violence.
Well, here's an interesting footnote now to all of this we've been talking about.
Illinois passed one of these gaming laws not that long ago.
Overturned.
It was supposed to go into effect January 1st of 2006.
However, a district judge ruled that it would violate First Amendment.
And so the bill was stricken.
Interesting.
Wait, amendment, amendment, constitution.
Yeah, those are those things that our government continuously ignores.
Oh, that's right.
Constitution.
I remember the constitution.
We used to study that in elementary school.
But now they just teach it because they're forced to.
I thought this was interesting.
I have to say this.
You have to hear this, okay?
This was a 53-page ruling by Judge Kennelly.
He specifically talks about God of War and mentions a minigame where the character Kratos has sexual relations with two women.
Quote, Because of this one scene, a game such as God of War, which essentially parallels a classic book like The Odyssey, likely would be prohibited for minors under the SEVGL because the statute allows a game to be regulated based on one scene without regard to the value of the game as a whole.
Such a sweeping regulation on speech, even sexually explicit speech, is unconstitutional even if aimed at protecting minors.
I love this man.
The game does not show him having sex at all.
We're going to get some emails.
I'm looking forward to it.
Because whenever we bring up politics, it's like angry emails.
Not just angry emails, but angry emails.
Honestly, the people that I know personally who grew up very sheltered still live with their parents.
Alright, let's get back into some other gaming news and let's talk about those violent video games as well as the G-rated ones coming out very soon.
Loki, what kind of games can we expect coming out in the U.S.?
I know we're getting towards the end of the year, so not a lot, but what's coming out in the U.S.?
Not much, but it's really the only big things we've got coming out, especially this week, Animal Crossing and Final Fantasy.
Now, if you're more of a fan of the portable stuff, you've got...
A lot of stuff for the PSP.
For example, Smackdown vs. Raw 06 is coming out finally for the PSP, which is good.
Other than that, December is a very dead month for games.
The biggest game probably coming out this month is going to be Gauntlet Seven Sorrows for the PlayStation 2 and Xbox.
But a lot of everything else has moved away.
Of course, Dead Alive 4 coming out for the 360 on the 15th.
I heard they got pushed back again, though.
No, it was pushed to the 6th, and then they got pushed back to the 15th.
So, the 15th, hopefully.
But January, there's going to be a little bit more coming, hopefully.
We've got 25 to Life being the big one, the next cop-killer game that'll be coming out.
They'll be getting the press, I'm sure.
Ape Escape 3 Ape Escape Academy
DS and PSP, King Kong
on the Xbox and GameCube, Chronicles of Narnia.
We have WWE SmackDown vs. Raw 2006 for the PSP and The Sims 2 and King Kong on the Game Boy Advance.
Actually, and I do apologize because Sims 2 and King Kong are coming out on the 16th and 17th.
But I find it incredibly hilarious that the UK is getting a release of America's Army Rise of a Soldier.
You know, it's a very popular game over here.
It's kind of got a little underground following that we don't talk about much, but I've run into a lot of people that are really into this game.
Well, it is supposed to be a fairly accurate representation, but I don't know why I find it funny that it's being released overseas.
Loki, you've got a story about Madden in general.
and so on.
S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
Three years later.
You also do the same thing in Derby Owners Club with horses.
Well, kind of, but... That's a little different.
A little different, yeah.
Breed your own human.
All right, interesting.
Well, we'll see what happens with that.
That'll be a fun court battle, or more likely, out-of-court settlement.
We'll see what happens with that.
DarkSakura is here to remind us that there is a big world out there outside of gaming.
Because if all you did all day long was stay outside and play video games, you would have no time to go out and corrupt the youth of America.
So DarkSakura... She just gave me a face.
I got a face.
That's a knowing smile.
DarkSakura is here to give us her advice column because there's a whole world outside.
Go live in it.
DarkSakura, what are you going to tell the kids about today?
Today's bit of advice is how to evade a stampede of shoppers.
Oh, now this is good.
This is very timely.
I like this.
Yeah.
Number one, react immediately.
Stay focused and visualize your goal.
Reacting early and decisively in crowds affords you your best shot at survival.
Two, do not join the herd.
You cannot shop if you cannot see the merchandise.
3.
Do not move toward the herd.
You risk being trampled if you try to thread your way through a stampede.
If you are unable to get out of the way, bring your arms in tightly around any packages you are carrying, turn your body in the direction of the crowd, and let yourself be carried along as you work your way to the outside.
Maximize your movement options.
If you need to negotiate your way through a crowd, stay on the edge.
Most shoppers will leave at least a few feet between themselves and surrounding walls so you will have room to maneuver.
But my final bit of advice, just avoid the mall.
You don't need a tickle meal or whatever it is this year.
Seriously, I went to the mall today.
You went to the mall.
I know, I went to the mall.
I spent half my time looking for a parking space.
That's it.
Interesting.
Amazingly enough, last year I actually had a pretty easy time parking because I have mad parking lots going.
Oh, no.
I even did the trick at the local mall.
What you do is you drive up the parking structure to the very, very top because there's a secret entrance to the mall that I thought nobody knew about.
But, oh, my God, completely full.
The parking lot at the top, completely full.
I follow people who leave.
Yeah, I know.
That's what you're supposed to do in the city and stuff.
Whatever.
I stalk.
Whatever.
All right.
Anyway, a couple quick last few items for you guys here.
I have just a couple quick stories.
We'll go over to... Sorry, guys.
I'm having mic problems again.
A couple quick stories for you guys, and we'll go over to Loki.
I think this is interesting.
There's the Star Trek MMO that's coming out very soon.
Well, there was a study done, which was quizzing 600 gamers who were interested in both Star Trek and MMORPGs.
divided them into three subgroups based on their interest, blah blah blah blah blah.
The result, 69% of MMO players were interested in Star Trek Online, and 59% of Star Trek enthusiasts wanted to play the game.
However, only 31% of regular PC gamers were eager to jump onto Star Trek Online.
I gotta say, I'm curious.
I think there's a lot of interesting ideas they could do with a Star Trek game.
I wouldn't call myself a Trekkie, but I think it could make a decent game.
I want to play a cue.
Interesting.
Alright, that was done by the way Nielsen Research and Perpetual Entertainment who are developing the upcoming PC MMO.
One other quick story for you guys.
Halo the movie has a rumored director attached.
Rumored, rumored.
I'm going to pronounce this name hideously wrong.
I'm sorry.
Guillermo?
Guillermo?
I don't know.
Guillermo del Toro who directed Hellboy is rumored to be the person that they are courting to get to do the Halo movie.
I think most people would just rather see Peter Jackson do it himself, but
Who knows?
After you guys see King Kong, you might feel differently.
I don't know.
We'll see.
Loki, what else you got for us?
Didn't Peter Jackson also do Dead Alive?
He also did Meet the Feebles.
Let's not forget.
Any last stories you got, Loki?
Some real quick stuff.
The new Grand Theft Auto mod has just
Superjump, The Ability to Walk Through Walls
It's Half-Life 2 Survivor.
It's actually a first-person shooter for the arcade.
It's going to have a card system to be able to save your progress.
Basically, the controls kind of look like a driving cabinet.
You have two controllers, one for looking, one for aiming, and then foot pedals for jumping and crouching.
So the grid, but way better.
Yeah, way better.
So that's kind of a really cool game.
I thought the grid was your favorite game.
No.
There's been also another kind of marketing campaign going on for the PSP, one featuring dust bunnies and a squirrel.
And it's really strange.
They describe the PSP as like a nut you can play with outside.
What's very interesting, though... There's no sense in... Oh, whatever.
Forget it.
What's very interesting, though, and this is actually... They've got...
These weird swirly things in the eyes that kind of look stoned, which also matches this new campaign that's going on, kind of a graffiti campaign, which you see kids basically hypnotized by the PSP.
Now, most people aren't liking this, and they're actually tagging over it and writing very colorful things like, I'll ride a Brompton bicycle or a teabag of mine before I give Sony Corp another fucking dime.
And
I like the part about the mime.
Because there's not enough mime violence in the world.
Not enough mime violence.
But it's basically popping up everywhere.
They've actually caught some of the artists responsible for it.
Pictures of them.
So another campaign that's not really welcome.
And finally...
I hope you enjoy that 360 for what you paid for They have so voided that warranty
Yes, and that is it.
But using Google Maps to do it is playing Risk on Google Maps.
Well, if you wanted to check out this game, sorry, too bad, it's done.
It got ceased and desisted by Hasbro, who owns the right to Risk.
And did you know put out their own versions of Risk in 96 and 2000, I believe the goodbye message said.
Nevertheless, Hasbro none too happy that somebody is infringing on their trademark.
My suggestion to the authors, rename it World Conquest and make it similar but not the same.
Yeah, whatever.
Make it Nobody Can Take Russia.
or, you know, Google Maps will let you go anywhere.
So you could do, like, you know, Canadian Conquest.
Just choose Canada.
Or you could do L.A.
Conquest.
Just zoom in on L.A.
and do Risk.
Oh, forget it.
Iowa Conquest.
What?
Iowa Conquest.
Iowa.
Delaware Conquest.
Yeah, we definitely have to end this show now.
So, Loki, what is your final thought?
My final thought is I'm going to play more games this week.
And my final thought would be, so am I. DarkSakura, your final thought.
Reject false icons, and I would like to be over the plague any minute now.
Alright.
Until next time, kids.
Which, by the way, did you know next week is episode number 50?
Good times.
We'll see you then.
That's the end of another Orange Lounge Radio To Go edition.
This podcast is a proud part of www.orangeloungeradio.com.
See you next update.
