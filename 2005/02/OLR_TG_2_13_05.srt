00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:03,932
[SPEAKER_04]: Orange Lounge Radio To Go Edition, week of February 14th, 2005.

2
00:00:04,453 --> 00:00:15,800
[SPEAKER_00]: And now, the Orange Lounge Radio To Go Edition, your internet radio home for discussion on rhythm and music gaming, and all the news on video games that don't suck.

3
00:00:16,220 --> 00:00:20,463
[SPEAKER_00]: And now, here are your hosts, DarkSakura, Sky, and Loki.

4
00:00:21,417 --> 00:00:28,418
[SPEAKER_04]: Hello everybody once again, and thank you for subscribing to our podcast and downloading yet another episode.

5
00:00:28,838 --> 00:00:31,299
[SPEAKER_04]: Here we are, the week of Valentine's Day.

6
00:00:31,819 --> 00:00:34,139
[SPEAKER_04]: I hope you all are having a lovely Valentine's Day.

7
00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:34,920
[SPEAKER_04]: I know I'm not.

8
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:38,260
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I'm single as hell, but that's alright.

9
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:42,661
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura is actually out tonight because she's spending the holiday with her fiancÃ©.

10
00:00:42,961 --> 00:00:44,381
[SPEAKER_04]: So we have some guests filling in tonight.

11
00:00:44,441 --> 00:00:45,722
[SPEAKER_04]: Say hello to DDR Angel.

12
00:00:46,002 --> 00:00:46,322
[SPEAKER_01]: Hello.

13
00:00:46,662 --> 00:00:48,302
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi DDR Angel, welcome to our podcast.

14
00:00:49,468 --> 00:00:50,569
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

15
00:01:19,159 --> 00:01:23,843
[SPEAKER_03]: I put a PC, a Micro ITX PC, which is a form factor.

16
00:01:23,923 --> 00:01:27,226
[SPEAKER_03]: It's 15 centimeters by 15 centimeters is the size of the motherboard.

17
00:01:28,127 --> 00:01:31,610
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's inside of an Xbox that's painted orange.

18
00:01:32,130 --> 00:01:33,331
[SPEAKER_03]: Hence the orange box.

19
00:01:35,253 --> 00:01:38,495
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, if Bill Gates finds out about this, do you think you're going to be in any trouble?

20
00:01:38,516 --> 00:01:44,240
[SPEAKER_03]: The only trouble I'd be in is because I have a pirated version of Windows in it, but that's about it.

21
00:01:44,861 --> 00:01:47,283
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, that and the movies that might be on the hard drive.

22
00:01:47,955 --> 00:01:50,817
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not RIA or MPA friendly.

23
00:01:51,537 --> 00:01:54,019
[SPEAKER_04]: You do know anyone can download this podcast, right?

24
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:56,820
[SPEAKER_03]: Whatever, I don't care.

25
00:01:57,601 --> 00:01:58,541
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll put Linux on it.

26
00:01:58,962 --> 00:02:00,382
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't make me put Linux on it.

27
00:02:00,582 --> 00:02:01,483
[SPEAKER_03]: God damn it, I will.

28
00:02:01,703 --> 00:02:03,064
[SPEAKER_04]: Free BSD all the way.

29
00:02:05,285 --> 00:02:06,366
[SPEAKER_04]: And how's the monitor work?

30
00:02:06,746 --> 00:02:12,309
[SPEAKER_04]: You took like a little PS1 monitor that, you know, they don't really sell so many of those anymore because they don't sell the PS1 so much.

31
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:14,871
[SPEAKER_04]: But you actually took one of those little portable 5-inch monitors.

32
00:02:15,171 --> 00:02:16,612
[SPEAKER_04]: How the hell are you able to see anything on this thing?

33
00:02:17,951 --> 00:02:21,012
[SPEAKER_03]: Very carefully enlarged all the fonts on it to very large.

34
00:02:21,572 --> 00:02:28,913
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, I also have, thank God for Windows and having that, you know, feature the magnifier for those people that can't see shit.

35
00:02:29,933 --> 00:02:37,434
[SPEAKER_03]: You load that up there and anything that you, you know, move over with your mouse, it will enlarge in this little window for you.

36
00:02:37,514 --> 00:02:38,995
[SPEAKER_03]: So I've used that a lot.

37
00:02:40,895 --> 00:02:46,456
[SPEAKER_03]: But to be honest, actually you can see quite a bit on that monitor because it's such a high resolution monitor.

38
00:02:47,165 --> 00:02:48,586
[SPEAKER_03]: Small text is the only problem.

39
00:02:49,347 --> 00:02:54,172
[SPEAKER_04]: I notice it's very crisp, so if you do plan to use it for movies or games or something, it's going to be very crisp.

40
00:02:54,392 --> 00:02:57,295
[SPEAKER_04]: Kind of hard to see, but interesting.

41
00:02:57,975 --> 00:03:05,382
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, I thought we'd go around, and before we get into this week's gaming news, since we do have some guests on the panel tonight, I thought we could talk about what kind of games you've been playing this week.

42
00:03:05,422 --> 00:03:06,563
[SPEAKER_04]: What kind of stuff have you been into?

43
00:03:06,904 --> 00:03:07,124
[SPEAKER_04]: Angel?

44
00:03:08,705 --> 00:03:12,189
[SPEAKER_01]: The MXO beta test, which was...

45
00:03:12,765 --> 00:03:13,445
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, whatever.

46
00:03:13,585 --> 00:03:16,746
[SPEAKER_04]: And for those not in the know, in the acronym know, that was Matrix Online, right?

47
00:03:16,766 --> 00:03:17,467
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, Matrix Online.

48
00:03:20,067 --> 00:03:21,188
[SPEAKER_01]: Whatever, I'll give it another week.

49
00:03:21,468 --> 00:03:25,749
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you think it's... I noticed that people are selling... Because you had to have a code to get into the Matrix Online beta test, right?

50
00:03:26,029 --> 00:03:28,250
[SPEAKER_04]: I noticed people are selling those codes on eBay.

51
00:03:28,810 --> 00:03:30,571
[SPEAKER_04]: My first question is, A, is that legal?

52
00:03:30,611 --> 00:03:31,031
[SPEAKER_04]: Probably not.

53
00:03:31,071 --> 00:03:31,971
[SPEAKER_04]: But B, is it worth it?

54
00:03:31,991 --> 00:03:33,452
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.

55
00:03:33,512 --> 00:03:35,372
[SPEAKER_01]: You can get it at five bucks for fries.

56
00:03:35,772 --> 00:03:36,993
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, at fries.

57
00:03:37,313 --> 00:03:37,593
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

58
00:03:38,253 --> 00:03:39,554
[SPEAKER_01]: Go to fries and get it for five bucks.

59
00:03:40,154 --> 00:03:40,454
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I...

60
00:03:41,433 --> 00:03:45,476
[SPEAKER_04]: And you're doing like a pre-order then, and then you get to play the game on beta test as well.

61
00:03:45,796 --> 00:03:46,196
[SPEAKER_04]: That's cool.

62
00:03:46,477 --> 00:03:48,158
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, Loki, you've been playing this too, right?

63
00:03:48,938 --> 00:03:49,418
[SPEAKER_03]: A little bit.

64
00:03:49,939 --> 00:03:50,939
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm only level two.

65
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:56,003
[SPEAKER_03]: And I played it maybe about an hour, an hour at the most on this.

66
00:03:56,803 --> 00:03:57,504
[SPEAKER_03]: It looks pretty.

67
00:03:58,604 --> 00:04:04,308
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a little difficult to get into it because it's just like they kind of,

68
00:04:05,703 --> 00:04:06,283
[SPEAKER_03]: and so on.

69
00:04:30,709 --> 00:04:33,090
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, what else have you been playing this week, Angel?

70
00:04:54,398 --> 00:05:00,903
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, I watched someone play World of Warcraft, so I'm kind of getting a... I don't know.

71
00:05:00,963 --> 00:05:08,628
[SPEAKER_01]: I kind of want it, but I kind of don't because I don't want to be whooping on Final Fantasy XI too much because I do like that one a lot more.

72
00:05:08,648 --> 00:05:10,169
[SPEAKER_04]: I know.

73
00:05:10,270 --> 00:05:10,670
[SPEAKER_04]: It's tough.

74
00:05:10,950 --> 00:05:15,473
[SPEAKER_04]: As much as I love Final Fantasy XI, everybody is raving about World of Warcraft.

75
00:05:15,513 --> 00:05:20,097
[SPEAKER_04]: And the time I saw it, I was kind of like... Because I watched somebody play it too, and I was kind of like, eh.

76
00:05:20,637 --> 00:05:23,099
[SPEAKER_04]: But I kind of feel like I owe it to myself now with everybody just...

77
00:05:23,908 --> 00:05:24,568
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for watching!

78
00:05:43,275 --> 00:05:43,795
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what you like.

79
00:05:43,975 --> 00:05:49,438
[SPEAKER_01]: With our copy of World of Warcraft, we actually got a 10-day trial thing.

80
00:05:49,458 --> 00:05:52,520
[SPEAKER_01]: You could actually give the code to somebody else and try it for 10 days.

81
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:54,381
[SPEAKER_01]: It's open to me.

82
00:05:54,461 --> 00:05:57,202
[SPEAKER_01]: I can do it, but I don't know.

83
00:05:57,222 --> 00:05:57,602
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll see.

84
00:05:57,922 --> 00:05:58,403
[SPEAKER_04]: Interesting.

85
00:05:58,443 --> 00:06:02,725
[SPEAKER_04]: If you do end up doing it, I want your 10-day card that you get because I want to check it out a little more in depth.

86
00:06:02,805 --> 00:06:04,346
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, you mean if I buy my own copy?

87
00:06:04,366 --> 00:06:04,706
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, yeah.

88
00:06:04,926 --> 00:06:05,146
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah.

89
00:06:05,186 --> 00:06:05,586
[SPEAKER_01]: No problem.

90
00:06:05,806 --> 00:06:05,986
[SPEAKER_04]: Cool.

91
00:06:08,226 --> 00:06:11,348
[SPEAKER_01]: I've also been playing a lot of there this week now for those that don't know.

92
00:06:12,368 --> 00:06:14,289
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like TSO but better.

93
00:06:15,610 --> 00:06:17,671
[SPEAKER_04]: Whoa, you're playing the acronyms game again.

94
00:06:17,711 --> 00:06:18,452
[SPEAKER_04]: The Sims Online.

95
00:06:18,692 --> 00:06:22,034
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right.

96
00:06:23,034 --> 00:06:26,156
[SPEAKER_04]: It's chat about TSO and MXO on OLR.

97
00:06:27,517 --> 00:06:27,757
[SPEAKER_01]: See?

98
00:06:27,977 --> 00:06:28,777
[SPEAKER_01]: There you go.

99
00:06:28,837 --> 00:06:29,398
[SPEAKER_01]: Acronym game.

100
00:06:31,059 --> 00:06:36,962
[SPEAKER_01]: For those that want more information on their Open Up Your Internet Explorer I mean Explorer

101
00:06:37,575 --> 00:06:39,056
[SPEAKER_04]: or Firefox if you're smarter.

102
00:06:39,196 --> 00:06:42,038
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, you can't because it's picky about that.

103
00:06:42,098 --> 00:06:43,278
[SPEAKER_01]: It won't let you do it.

104
00:06:43,419 --> 00:06:43,659
[SPEAKER_01]: What?

105
00:06:44,119 --> 00:06:44,419
[SPEAKER_01]: I know.

106
00:06:44,499 --> 00:06:44,839
[SPEAKER_04]: Sucks.

107
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:45,320
[SPEAKER_04]: Lame.

108
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:45,920
[SPEAKER_01]: Whatever.

109
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:46,680
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't want to play it.

110
00:06:48,642 --> 00:06:50,143
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like an XML thing or something.

111
00:06:50,503 --> 00:06:55,526
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, yeah, so just go to there.com and find out for yourself if you really like it or not.

112
00:06:55,986 --> 00:06:56,326
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

113
00:06:56,947 --> 00:06:57,267
[SPEAKER_04]: Fair enough.

114
00:06:57,287 --> 00:06:59,988
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's kind of like The Sims Online but without all the prostitution.

115
00:07:01,009 --> 00:07:01,249
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

116
00:07:02,150 --> 00:07:02,610
[SPEAKER_01]: Whatever.

117
00:07:03,190 --> 00:07:04,151
[SPEAKER_04]: What's so fun in that?

118
00:07:05,117 --> 00:07:08,179
[SPEAKER_03]: Seriously, that's the only reason why I play The Sims Online.

119
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:10,821
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what I heard The Sims Online turned into.

120
00:07:11,002 --> 00:07:14,124
[SPEAKER_04]: It was like Vegas, and I don't know if this is true, but I was reading articles on this.

121
00:07:14,764 --> 00:07:19,848
[SPEAKER_04]: Sims Online turned into this big gambling, crack-dealing site.

122
00:07:20,869 --> 00:07:21,309
[SPEAKER_04]: Crazy.

123
00:07:21,950 --> 00:07:27,934
[SPEAKER_04]: I just know that The Sims Online was not quite as popular as I think they'd hoped it would be, considering the popularity of The Sims.

124
00:07:28,695 --> 00:07:30,536
[SPEAKER_01]: I also got to see Minish Cap this week.

125
00:07:30,556 --> 00:07:31,197
[SPEAKER_01]: That was pretty cool.

126
00:07:32,944 --> 00:07:35,045
[SPEAKER_04]: By the way, speaking of The Sims, I want to get this out real quick.

127
00:07:35,405 --> 00:07:38,166
[SPEAKER_04]: The Sims celebrated its fifth anniversary this week.

128
00:07:38,466 --> 00:07:46,949
[SPEAKER_04]: And get this, The Sims has shipped, since its release, 52 million units and been translated into 17 different languages.

129
00:07:47,289 --> 00:07:51,891
[SPEAKER_04]: The series of games has been a top seller for four of the past five years.

130
00:07:52,471 --> 00:07:53,152
[SPEAKER_04]: Crazy, huh?

131
00:07:53,392 --> 00:07:54,612
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow, yay for that.

132
00:07:56,373 --> 00:07:59,114
[SPEAKER_04]: The first time I played The Sims, I had to kill people.

133
00:08:01,095 --> 00:08:02,195
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know about the rest of you.

134
00:08:02,998 --> 00:08:04,459
[SPEAKER_04]: I know this is true with you, Loki.

135
00:08:04,479 --> 00:08:09,401
[SPEAKER_04]: When you did your review of The Sims 2, you were like, how many interesting ways could I kill people in this game?

136
00:08:10,562 --> 00:08:14,103
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly, and I have to really go back to that and find some more ways to do that.

137
00:08:14,523 --> 00:08:18,465
[SPEAKER_03]: Because my elaborate death house didn't turn out as fun as I thought it would be.

138
00:08:19,846 --> 00:08:21,487
[SPEAKER_02]: Ended up with piles of stuff.

139
00:08:22,187 --> 00:08:24,748
[SPEAKER_03]: No, people just didn't want to die that quickly.

140
00:08:26,529 --> 00:08:30,711
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I was putting in the cheat codes where you can move any object around.

141
00:08:31,232 --> 00:08:36,094
[SPEAKER_03]: So I was picking up people that were walking by the house and throwing them up into a room that was enclosed.

142
00:08:38,635 --> 00:08:40,756
[SPEAKER_03]: They didn't like that too much and they were panicking.

143
00:08:40,816 --> 00:08:41,257
[SPEAKER_03]: It was fun.

144
00:08:42,137 --> 00:08:45,759
[SPEAKER_03]: I was trying my best to catch a guy on fire but that really didn't happen.

145
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:55,383
[SPEAKER_04]: I remember how you put the giant diving board on the roof and you were going to wait for somebody to dive and then you were going to take away the pool while they were in the midair.

146
00:08:55,983 --> 00:08:59,965
[SPEAKER_04]: But nobody would ever jump off the board because they were all so sad.

147
00:09:01,636 --> 00:09:03,717
[SPEAKER_03]: They also didn't want to jump to their death.

148
00:09:04,017 --> 00:09:09,758
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought that would be, you know, a way to do it, but no one wanted to commit suicide.

149
00:09:09,798 --> 00:09:16,400
[SPEAKER_03]: They really need to, like, release a patch where, you know, it's less, you know, friendly, you know, just kind of let people die.

150
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:20,621
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course, I have the nude patch, so people will be walking around naked all the time, too.

151
00:09:21,361 --> 00:09:22,582
[SPEAKER_02]: The Sims Morbid Edition.

152
00:09:22,742 --> 00:09:23,602
[SPEAKER_04]: Only on the internet.

153
00:09:23,722 --> 00:09:24,802
[SPEAKER_04]: Anything else you've been playing, Angel?

154
00:09:25,963 --> 00:09:27,803
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, not that I can think of at the moment.

155
00:09:27,983 --> 00:09:28,703
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, fair enough.

156
00:09:28,783 --> 00:09:30,024
[SPEAKER_04]: Bud, what have you been playing this week?

157
00:09:30,264 --> 00:09:30,824
[SPEAKER_04]: Maps.google.com

158
00:09:33,092 --> 00:09:34,513
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, that is a very cool site.

159
00:09:34,993 --> 00:09:35,693
[SPEAKER_04]: I checked this out.

160
00:09:36,133 --> 00:09:37,654
[SPEAKER_04]: Very cool.

161
00:09:38,274 --> 00:09:42,955
[SPEAKER_04]: Sometimes it's fun to just play with those Atlas programs and like, oh, here's my house and here's, you know.

162
00:09:45,176 --> 00:09:51,798
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, what they don't have, which I think is really cool, and I think MapQuest has this, but it has like the satellite view version.

163
00:09:51,858 --> 00:09:52,979
[SPEAKER_04]: Or does Google have that now?

164
00:09:53,499 --> 00:09:53,819
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

165
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:55,820
[SPEAKER_03]: They have something similar.

166
00:09:56,220 --> 00:09:59,501
[SPEAKER_03]: There was actually an article on Hackaday.com.

167
00:09:59,761 --> 00:10:01,962
[SPEAKER_03]: They had a website that had both

168
00:10:02,651 --> 00:10:19,583
[SPEAKER_03]: Google's map feature and this other map feature where you can actually plug in I don't know, it was like coordinates actually and you can view the Google map and then also the actual satellite picture.

169
00:10:19,603 --> 00:10:20,604
[SPEAKER_02]: That was the London one, right?

170
00:10:22,045 --> 00:10:24,807
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't remember, but anyways.

171
00:10:25,708 --> 00:10:26,929
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, he's going to look that one up.

172
00:10:26,969 --> 00:10:29,030
[SPEAKER_03]: So you've been playing with that though?

173
00:10:29,370 --> 00:10:29,911
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yes.

174
00:10:29,931 --> 00:10:29,991
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

175
00:10:31,957 --> 00:10:33,959
[SPEAKER_03]: Yet again, another Linux.

176
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:37,482
[SPEAKER_03]: They stuck Linux in a Billy Bass.

177
00:10:38,343 --> 00:10:41,105
[SPEAKER_03]: What is a Billy Bass?

178
00:10:41,145 --> 00:10:42,006
[SPEAKER_02]: The singing fish.

179
00:10:42,186 --> 00:10:43,647
[SPEAKER_03]: The singing fish things.

180
00:10:45,129 --> 00:10:46,630
[SPEAKER_03]: Why, people, why?

181
00:10:47,030 --> 00:10:50,393
[SPEAKER_04]: A follow-up to last week when we were talking about they won't install Linux in anything.

182
00:10:50,493 --> 00:10:52,575
[SPEAKER_04]: There you go, they've installed Linux in a Billy Bass.

183
00:10:54,036 --> 00:10:55,237
[SPEAKER_02]: My pants are still Linux-free.

184
00:10:56,318 --> 00:10:56,719
[SPEAKER_04]: For now.

185
00:10:58,101 --> 00:11:00,964
[SPEAKER_02]: Anything else you've been playing with other than the maps game?

186
00:11:01,044 --> 00:11:03,327
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been playing the real world game of employment.

187
00:11:05,369 --> 00:11:07,251
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't had time to play a damn game this week.

188
00:11:07,491 --> 00:11:09,433
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, well you're a lot of fun to have on this show then.

189
00:11:09,513 --> 00:11:10,133
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

190
00:11:10,334 --> 00:11:10,694
[SPEAKER_04]: It's alright.

191
00:11:10,834 --> 00:11:11,715
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't even make it to Halo 2.

192
00:11:13,117 --> 00:11:15,739
[SPEAKER_02]: I watched my Mac sleep all week.

193
00:11:15,819 --> 00:11:18,963
[SPEAKER_04]: I haven't played Halo in a long time.

194
00:11:19,023 --> 00:11:19,643
[SPEAKER_04]: It's kind of sad.

195
00:11:19,663 --> 00:11:20,364
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

196
00:11:20,911 --> 00:11:33,860
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, what I've been playing this week, I've been playing... I actually decided... Well, I played Mr. Driller a little more, because Angel let me borrow Mr. Driller, and I actually... Remember how last week I said I needed to get good at the game and figure out the strategies?

197
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:35,841
[SPEAKER_04]: I think I'm getting okay.

198
00:11:36,241 --> 00:11:41,845
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm finally learning how to get some of those tricky air capsules without having to dig straight down all the time, and I'm getting the concept.

199
00:11:42,265 --> 00:11:44,467
[SPEAKER_04]: All it took was a little time, and I figured it out.

200
00:11:45,608 --> 00:11:45,908
[SPEAKER_04]: Also...

201
00:11:47,438 --> 00:11:54,642
[SPEAKER_04]: I decided to go a little retro this week because you might remember that DarkSakura, she brought with her to the three hour show last week.

202
00:11:54,662 --> 00:12:00,665
[SPEAKER_04]: She brought Dracula X, but the Japanese version on the Turbo Duo.

203
00:12:00,925 --> 00:12:02,246
[SPEAKER_04]: And we were watching little clips from that.

204
00:12:02,526 --> 00:12:06,888
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I remember somebody said that there was a Super Nintendo version of that game that came out and I played it.

205
00:12:07,822 --> 00:12:12,824
[SPEAKER_04]: and it's awful compared to the one that she brought last week on the TurboDuo.

206
00:12:12,864 --> 00:12:19,526
[SPEAKER_04]: It is just dreadful and I remember I had played that game a long time ago when it first came out and I was like, what happened to the Castlevania games?

207
00:12:19,546 --> 00:12:20,546
[SPEAKER_04]: They used to be so cool.

208
00:12:21,087 --> 00:12:27,689
[SPEAKER_04]: So I decided instead to go back and play Super Castlevania 4 because that game is awesome and it's a great Castlevania game.

209
00:12:27,789 --> 00:12:29,870
[SPEAKER_04]: So I was feeling a little retro this week.

210
00:12:30,910 --> 00:12:31,550
[SPEAKER_04]: You had a common angel?

211
00:12:31,570 --> 00:12:34,051
[SPEAKER_01]: I was going to say, I didn't even know you had a Super Nintendo.

212
00:12:35,031 --> 00:12:35,632
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yes, he did.

213
00:12:35,972 --> 00:12:36,532
[SPEAKER_04]: I have one.

214
00:12:37,026 --> 00:12:37,666
[SPEAKER_04]: on my PC.

215
00:12:39,147 --> 00:12:43,648
[SPEAKER_04]: Get it?

216
00:12:44,629 --> 00:12:46,289
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki, what kind of games have you been playing this week?

217
00:12:48,330 --> 00:12:51,892
[SPEAKER_03]: I played Matrix Online and Final Fantasy XI.

218
00:12:52,132 --> 00:12:57,053
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't even gotten back to Grand Theft Auto San Andreas yet.

219
00:12:58,874 --> 00:13:00,235
[SPEAKER_03]: I really need to go back to that.

220
00:13:01,435 --> 00:13:01,975
[SPEAKER_03]: It'll be fun.

221
00:13:03,776 --> 00:13:06,657
[SPEAKER_03]: No other game I'm going to be playing soon, which comes out tomorrow.

222
00:13:08,140 --> 00:13:09,781
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep, WarioWare Touched.

223
00:13:10,881 --> 00:13:11,901
[SPEAKER_03]: That's going to be the next game.

224
00:13:12,961 --> 00:13:17,723
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm very excited about WarioWare Touched, and I think it's great that they're releasing it on Valentine's Day.

225
00:13:17,783 --> 00:13:20,544
[SPEAKER_04]: For those that are downloading the podcast throughout the week, he's talking about Valentine's Day.

226
00:13:20,864 --> 00:13:21,744
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, does it ship?

227
00:13:22,084 --> 00:13:23,845
[SPEAKER_04]: This is one thing that always confuses the hell out of me.

228
00:13:24,245 --> 00:13:27,306
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it shipping tomorrow, or is it shelving tomorrow?

229
00:13:27,366 --> 00:13:31,307
[SPEAKER_04]: Because you know that they have a ship day, and then usually the shelf date is one or two days afterwards.

230
00:13:31,707 --> 00:13:33,208
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it shipping or shelving tomorrow?

231
00:13:33,588 --> 00:13:34,288
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what I want to know.

232
00:13:36,936 --> 00:13:37,577
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I don't know.

233
00:13:37,818 --> 00:13:43,612
[SPEAKER_03]: I have only been going by IGN's site, which has the release date for tomorrow.

234
00:13:44,093 --> 00:13:45,176
[SPEAKER_03]: So, whatever that means.

235
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:52,064
[SPEAKER_04]: Probably the ship, so I'm not going to go to the store until Tuesday, but I'm very excited nonetheless to be playing this game.

236
00:13:52,204 --> 00:13:52,684
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm very excited.

237
00:13:52,704 --> 00:13:55,567
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll bring you a full review of that next week, because you know we're all going to be playing that.

238
00:13:55,747 --> 00:13:57,868
[SPEAKER_04]: You like the WarioWare games too, right Angel?

239
00:13:57,988 --> 00:13:58,649
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, I do.

240
00:14:00,911 --> 00:14:04,654
[SPEAKER_01]: There might be a GameStop trip in the near future.

241
00:14:04,974 --> 00:14:06,735
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it supposed to have multiplayer in this one?

242
00:14:06,895 --> 00:14:07,416
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't remember.

243
00:14:08,550 --> 00:14:09,210
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't remember either.

244
00:14:09,250 --> 00:14:18,552
[SPEAKER_04]: I hope they took some of the good ideas from the GameCube one, because the GameCube WarioWare was like, eh, you know, because it was basically the same darn game, but it had such a cool, like, multiplayer edition.

245
00:14:18,572 --> 00:14:19,812
[SPEAKER_01]: But multiplayer is so much fun!

246
00:14:19,932 --> 00:14:20,973
[SPEAKER_04]: It is so much fun!

247
00:14:21,973 --> 00:14:22,493
[SPEAKER_04]: Only one player.

248
00:14:23,153 --> 00:14:23,453
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't!

249
00:14:23,553 --> 00:14:23,933
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't!

250
00:14:25,033 --> 00:14:30,935
[SPEAKER_04]: Classic Nintendo, they'll do the multiplayer in the next release, and it'll be the same damn game, but multiplayer.

251
00:14:31,395 --> 00:14:32,235
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh well, gotta love them.

252
00:14:33,277 --> 00:14:35,118
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, let's talk about some news this week.

253
00:14:35,138 --> 00:14:37,839
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll actually start it off with Nintendo.

254
00:14:37,879 --> 00:14:40,341
[SPEAKER_04]: I have quite a little bit of Nintendo news to talk about right now.

255
00:14:42,182 --> 00:14:42,902
[SPEAKER_04]: This is interesting.

256
00:14:43,162 --> 00:14:48,425
[SPEAKER_04]: EBGames.com is listing a Metroid pinball game for the DS.

257
00:14:49,986 --> 00:14:50,706
[SPEAKER_04]: Very interesting.

258
00:14:50,826 --> 00:14:54,468
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know, they're listing it on their game as tentative December 5th.

259
00:14:55,129 --> 00:15:01,512
[SPEAKER_04]: Nintendo of America will not comment on this, but if you think about it, in the game, in Metroid the game...

260
00:15:02,245 --> 00:15:04,347
[SPEAKER_04]: Samus does condense into the little ball.

261
00:15:04,388 --> 00:15:06,790
[SPEAKER_04]: It's one of the first things she gets, so I don't know.

262
00:15:07,070 --> 00:15:08,772
[SPEAKER_04]: This would be kind of a fit.

263
00:15:10,034 --> 00:15:13,337
[SPEAKER_01]: Why did that suddenly bring me back to, like, Sonic Spinball?

264
00:15:13,518 --> 00:15:15,380
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the first thing I thought of, too, was Sonic Spinball.

265
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:19,264
[SPEAKER_04]: Because it had, like, that same look in the sewer stage in the beginning.

266
00:15:19,284 --> 00:15:19,644
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

267
00:15:20,445 --> 00:15:21,166
[SPEAKER_04]: Same thing.

268
00:15:21,827 --> 00:15:22,287
[SPEAKER_04]: Same thing.

269
00:15:22,468 --> 00:15:23,629
[SPEAKER_02]: Sonic Spinball and Pokemon.

270
00:15:24,648 --> 00:15:30,869
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess the Pokemon pinball games do pretty well, so why not, since we haven't had a new Pokemon game in a while, why not go into another series?

271
00:15:31,649 --> 00:15:33,690
[SPEAKER_04]: Mario had a pinball game as well.

272
00:15:34,090 --> 00:15:34,290
[SPEAKER_04]: What?

273
00:15:34,810 --> 00:15:37,271
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, Mario had a pinball game not too long ago on the Advance.

274
00:15:38,191 --> 00:15:38,431
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki.

275
00:15:39,791 --> 00:15:40,231
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

276
00:15:40,451 --> 00:15:42,071
[SPEAKER_03]: Why with the pinball games?

277
00:15:42,212 --> 00:15:44,412
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, why?

278
00:15:44,972 --> 00:15:47,092
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess it would work, though, with the two shoulder buttons.

279
00:15:47,112 --> 00:15:47,733
[SPEAKER_03]: That'd be kind of neat.

280
00:15:47,833 --> 00:15:48,493
[SPEAKER_03]: The screen's tall.

281
00:15:50,919 --> 00:16:19,675
[SPEAKER_03]: yeah I don't know I could see it as more as like a little mini game that they might include with like you know the Metroid Prime Hunters or something like that interesting to see coming out soon or actually I should say just was released not too long ago Judge Dread Dread vs. Death why are they releasing Judge Dread games honestly I am the law couldn't tell you that one um

282
00:16:20,385 --> 00:16:27,469
[SPEAKER_04]: Also in the news about Nintendo, this story is coming out of the Japanese Trademark and Patent Office, or at least that's the place that inspired this story.

283
00:16:27,829 --> 00:16:33,332
[SPEAKER_04]: Nintendo has registered a couple trademarks recently, one of them being the Nintendo V-Pocket.

284
00:16:34,393 --> 00:16:42,917
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, you don't know what that means, but it also has a little logo that goes with it, and the rumor is saying that maybe it's some type of DS adapter.

285
00:16:43,398 --> 00:16:43,878
[SPEAKER_04]: Who knows?

286
00:16:44,278 --> 00:16:48,520
[SPEAKER_04]: Could it be that rumored MPEG-4 and MP3 adapter?

287
00:16:49,121 --> 00:16:49,601
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't know.

288
00:16:50,319 --> 00:16:50,699
[SPEAKER_04]: Who knows?

289
00:16:51,740 --> 00:16:52,080
[SPEAKER_03]: It is.

290
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:53,560
[SPEAKER_03]: It is the adapter.

291
00:16:53,601 --> 00:16:54,241
[SPEAKER_03]: V Pocket.

292
00:16:54,301 --> 00:16:55,101
[SPEAKER_03]: Video Pocket.

293
00:16:55,141 --> 00:16:55,481
[SPEAKER_03]: Hello.

294
00:16:55,561 --> 00:16:55,962
[SPEAKER_03]: Come on.

295
00:16:56,502 --> 00:16:58,183
[SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't take a genius to figure this one out.

296
00:16:58,363 --> 00:16:59,443
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, that's what it is.

297
00:17:00,224 --> 00:17:00,864
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what it's going to be.

298
00:17:00,884 --> 00:17:04,405
[SPEAKER_03]: Because everyone loves and is eating up portable video.

299
00:17:04,926 --> 00:17:16,911
[SPEAKER_03]: And now that the PSP is going to have the UMD format, of course they're going to need to come up with their own format for, you know, to be used with the DS or to be used with, you know, the GBA.

300
00:17:16,971 --> 00:17:18,372
[SPEAKER_03]: So, of course, that's what it is.

301
00:17:19,477 --> 00:17:20,618
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, we'll see if you're right.

302
00:17:21,358 --> 00:17:42,870
[SPEAKER_04]: Speaking of the games coming out for PSP, or I should say the movies, there's actually going to be some movies released on UMD format on April 19th here in America, and we're going to have films XXX, XXX, whatever you want to call it, you know that Vin Diesel movie, Hellboy, Resident Evil Apocalypse, and Once Upon a Time in Mexico.

303
00:17:43,170 --> 00:17:48,693
[SPEAKER_04]: They're going to be released on that UMD format specifically for your PSP so you can watch movies on the go.

304
00:17:49,927 --> 00:17:51,067
[SPEAKER_04]: Sound interesting to anybody?

305
00:17:51,868 --> 00:17:53,128
[SPEAKER_04]: Is this something you'd be interested in?

306
00:17:54,368 --> 00:17:54,569
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

307
00:17:55,529 --> 00:18:07,813
[SPEAKER_03]: It's interesting in perspective of me, because I work at a video distribution company, so it's yet another format that won't take off, just like the DVHS.

308
00:18:08,373 --> 00:18:10,654
[SPEAKER_03]: So, nice try.

309
00:18:10,734 --> 00:18:14,295
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll see how long it goes, but I don't think people are going to be buying other copies.

310
00:18:14,315 --> 00:18:18,376
[SPEAKER_03]: I know what's going to happen is they're going to find a way to just put this on a flash card for, you know,

311
00:18:20,113 --> 00:18:20,573
[SPEAKER_03]: It won't work.

312
00:18:20,593 --> 00:18:25,074
[SPEAKER_02]: Aren't the USPSPs coming with Spider-Man 2 and UMD?

313
00:18:25,194 --> 00:18:26,535
[SPEAKER_04]: This is one of the stories we talked about last week.

314
00:18:26,555 --> 00:18:29,555
[SPEAKER_04]: If you buy one of the first million units, you're going to get a copy of Spider-Man 2.

315
00:18:30,956 --> 00:18:36,057
[SPEAKER_04]: But as I mentioned last week, who doesn't own that movie already anyway?

316
00:18:36,857 --> 00:18:40,018
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, anybody that had a remote interest in that movie probably has it already.

317
00:18:40,418 --> 00:18:40,738
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

318
00:18:41,058 --> 00:18:41,778
[SPEAKER_04]: That's just my thought.

319
00:18:42,578 --> 00:18:46,299
[SPEAKER_04]: But another interesting thing about this format that I think is interesting is that

320
00:18:47,066 --> 00:18:57,135
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't really see this catching on too much because I think there's a very limited genre as to what can be released on the PSP.

321
00:18:57,295 --> 00:19:02,539
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't see them releasing Academy Award winning foreign films on UMD format.

322
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:05,742
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's going to be mostly these bang bang shoot-em-up films.

323
00:19:06,022 --> 00:19:09,285
[SPEAKER_02]: Although I believe they also opened the format.

324
00:19:10,313 --> 00:19:16,057
[SPEAKER_02]: The hardware to create the format is not readily available, and therefore it's probably not going to fly that well.

325
00:19:16,417 --> 00:19:24,322
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to be like Minidisc, it's going to be an underground thing where there's going to be some people that have it, and a lot of people that don't even know what the fuck it is.

326
00:19:25,142 --> 00:19:29,725
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, and it seems to me that if you want to watch movies on the go, they already have portable DVD players.

327
00:19:29,745 --> 00:19:31,186
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't have a proprietary format.

328
00:19:31,406 --> 00:19:34,069
[SPEAKER_04]: How many formats do you want to buy your movies in?

329
00:19:55,953 --> 00:20:20,619
[SPEAKER_04]: DHS, DVD Here's where I think Nintendo actually might be more successful in this This is the interesting part, if they do decide to release their thing Because if you look at the Game Boy Advance movies that they have out right now Like the Spongebob and the Strawberry Shortcake and all that stuff they have out The reason why these are easy for kids is because they're great for car rides You give the kid the little game and they can sit and watch it

330
00:20:21,331 --> 00:20:24,633
[SPEAKER_04]: while they're on the road and on the road a long drive to somewhere.

331
00:20:24,933 --> 00:20:29,996
[SPEAKER_04]: But I can't imagine giving a kid a PSP and having them watch Hellboy in the backseat of the car, you know?

332
00:20:31,177 --> 00:20:39,862
[SPEAKER_04]: I think Nintendo and their bit of a family-friendly, quote-unquote, edge, although they took a lot of crap for that back in the day, I think that's going to help them out in this market.

333
00:20:39,922 --> 00:20:41,723
[SPEAKER_04]: But that's just my personal thought.

334
00:20:42,144 --> 00:20:48,267
[SPEAKER_04]: Unless the PSP decides to get competitive and release some of their own kid-friendly stuff, because I think that's really where this stuff is handy.

335
00:20:48,407 --> 00:20:49,348
[SPEAKER_04]: But what do I know?

336
00:20:53,106 --> 00:20:55,167
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just waiting and waiting.

337
00:20:55,307 --> 00:20:57,588
[SPEAKER_03]: I know it's going to happen.

338
00:20:57,608 --> 00:21:06,312
[SPEAKER_03]: The PSP has got the memory stick port on it.

339
00:21:06,972 --> 00:21:15,716
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sure they're going to release something that's going to plug into that damn thing that you're just going to be able to put some other format of movie on a flash card in that damn thing.

340
00:21:17,376 --> 00:21:17,756
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

341
00:21:17,776 --> 00:21:21,438
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't see people going out and buying all these UMD format movies.

342
00:21:22,597 --> 00:21:23,117
[SPEAKER_03]: Why bother?

343
00:21:23,618 --> 00:21:24,618
[SPEAKER_02]: Why even, yeah.

344
00:21:24,638 --> 00:21:26,019
[SPEAKER_02]: I wouldn't even rent them.

345
00:21:26,900 --> 00:21:36,826
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe portable, but... No, I mean, to be honest, if you've got your PSP, okay, and this is just my thought, if you've got your PSP and you're on a car ride, you're playing fucking games.

346
00:21:37,186 --> 00:21:38,807
[SPEAKER_03]: You're not even watching movies.

347
00:21:39,367 --> 00:21:43,850
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why you bought PSPs, to play the portable games, not to watch the movies.

348
00:21:43,930 --> 00:21:45,891
[SPEAKER_03]: It is portable PlayStation, not portable DVD.

349
00:21:46,692 --> 00:21:46,852
[SPEAKER_04]: But...

350
00:21:47,816 --> 00:21:48,757
[SPEAKER_04]: Nintendo is a trusted name.

351
00:22:04,918 --> 00:22:05,959
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's move on to another.

352
00:22:06,380 --> 00:22:10,864
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, I wanted to say real quick, though, there is another Nintendo trademark that got filed.

353
00:22:10,904 --> 00:22:11,685
[SPEAKER_04]: This one's interesting.

354
00:22:12,105 --> 00:22:14,708
[SPEAKER_04]: It's PCGP.

355
00:22:15,209 --> 00:22:18,031
[SPEAKER_04]: And the way the logo looks is every letter is in a circle.

356
00:22:18,692 --> 00:22:23,757
[SPEAKER_04]: No idea what that could be about, but the speculation is perhaps the P is like Pokemon.

357
00:22:24,398 --> 00:22:26,941
[SPEAKER_04]: So maybe it's a new peripheral for some type of Pokemon game.

358
00:22:27,561 --> 00:22:28,002
[SPEAKER_04]: Who knows?

359
00:22:30,862 --> 00:22:37,765
[SPEAKER_04]: PCGP sounds like some new drug I don't know, Loki?

360
00:22:39,806 --> 00:22:40,746
[SPEAKER_02]: PC adapter to play?

361
00:22:41,126 --> 00:22:55,332
[SPEAKER_03]: No, if I was going to guess I would say maybe I'm probably going to be way off on this PC gaming portal in other words it's something for the DS if you have a wifi adapter or bluetooth or whatever to be playing over the internet with someone else.

362
00:22:55,713 --> 00:22:57,493
[SPEAKER_02]: Or to download more content.

363
00:22:58,234 --> 00:22:58,754
[SPEAKER_03]: Or something like that.

364
00:23:00,006 --> 00:23:03,448
[SPEAKER_04]: That guess is very cool, but I think you're wrong.

365
00:23:03,668 --> 00:23:07,089
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know, it just seems a little early for that, but that's a very cool guess.

366
00:23:07,890 --> 00:23:19,035
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it's a guess, but they will be announcing something of that sort at E3, so whether this be what it is, that will eventually happen, so that's that.

367
00:23:19,995 --> 00:23:20,956
[SPEAKER_04]: Very interesting.

368
00:23:21,116 --> 00:23:21,396
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

369
00:23:22,452 --> 00:23:23,393
[SPEAKER_04]: One other quick story.

370
00:23:23,433 --> 00:23:34,001
[SPEAKER_04]: I know we don't talk about the N-Gage too much on here, and there's a reason for that, but I thought it would be interesting to mention that the X-Men Legends game, it's done pretty well on the consoles, actually, and it's not a bad game.

371
00:23:34,421 --> 00:23:35,602
[SPEAKER_04]: It kind of reminded me of Diablo.

372
00:23:35,622 --> 00:23:37,563
[SPEAKER_04]: It was like Diablo X-Men was kind of what it was.

373
00:23:37,964 --> 00:23:47,130
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's going to be coming to the N-Gage, which... The N-Gage seems very limited to me, and I just don't know how they're going to pull it off.

374
00:23:48,491 --> 00:23:49,292
[SPEAKER_04]: But whatever, it's...

375
00:23:49,818 --> 00:23:53,140
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, they might as well put it on the Game Boy Color, but what do you think?

376
00:23:54,461 --> 00:24:01,586
[SPEAKER_02]: I think my cell phone, which is actually very similar to the N-Gage, is more useful than a freaking N-Gage because I don't have to taco-talk.

377
00:24:04,168 --> 00:24:12,474
[SPEAKER_04]: But the one cool thing about it, it will feature a wireless multiplayer mode, and that was one cool thing about X-Men Legends, that it had a multiplayer mode.

378
00:24:12,534 --> 00:24:17,678
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, granted, you had to play for a little bit before you could get multiplayer with it, but it does have multiplayer mode, so...

379
00:24:19,318 --> 00:24:24,021
[SPEAKER_04]: I know none of us in here own an N-Gage, but hypothetically, if you did, would there be an interest in this?

380
00:24:25,081 --> 00:24:25,301
[SPEAKER_01]: No.

381
00:24:26,702 --> 00:24:29,244
[SPEAKER_03]: I would have to really question why I owned an N-Gage.

382
00:24:30,284 --> 00:24:33,246
[SPEAKER_02]: You'd have to find the other three people in the country that bought the N-Gage.

383
00:24:34,547 --> 00:24:43,352
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, really, I had to laugh every time I walked by the N-Gage booth at E3 and all the people trying to get you to go in.

384
00:24:45,062 --> 00:24:48,184
[SPEAKER_03]: That was my favorite part because they were like, come on, check it out!

385
00:24:48,584 --> 00:24:50,105
[SPEAKER_03]: And I go play, I'm like, this is crap.

386
00:24:51,786 --> 00:24:52,847
[SPEAKER_04]: So, anyways.

387
00:24:54,068 --> 00:24:56,070
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, one more quick story and then we're going to wrap it up.

388
00:24:56,490 --> 00:24:57,611
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought this was interesting.

389
00:24:57,671 --> 00:24:58,651
[SPEAKER_04]: I actually read this story.

390
00:24:58,691 --> 00:25:05,316
[SPEAKER_04]: It was a link that was on Slashdot earlier this week, specifically their games portion, games.slashdot.org, which is a very cool site.

391
00:25:05,356 --> 00:25:07,238
[SPEAKER_04]: Check it out if you haven't already.

392
00:25:07,318 --> 00:25:10,580
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're a nerd, chances are you're already very familiar with Slashdot, but maybe you're not.

393
00:25:11,341 --> 00:25:13,102
[SPEAKER_04]: They had a link to this article that talked about

394
00:25:14,366 --> 00:25:18,548
[SPEAKER_04]: How important are review scores in game buying, really?

395
00:25:18,889 --> 00:25:21,690
[SPEAKER_04]: And I thought I'd kind of pose that same question to us here in the studio.

396
00:25:22,190 --> 00:25:25,572
[SPEAKER_04]: How much do you pay attention to the reviews that a game gets?

397
00:25:25,672 --> 00:25:28,314
[SPEAKER_04]: Have you ever been influenced to buy a game based on the reviews?

398
00:25:29,634 --> 00:25:33,897
[SPEAKER_04]: And if not that, what does influence you to buy games, out of curiosity?

399
00:25:33,997 --> 00:25:34,757
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll start with Loki.

400
00:25:35,798 --> 00:25:43,862
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't really go by the numbers or whatever, but I'll listen to what they have to say about the game and consider those factors, you know, since they've played the game.

401
00:25:45,969 --> 00:25:47,550
[SPEAKER_02]: But a lot of times it really... That would be a review.

402
00:25:49,351 --> 00:25:51,032
[SPEAKER_03]: No shit, Sherlock.

403
00:25:51,553 --> 00:25:55,976
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm talking about like, I'm not going to say, okay, if he gives it a 10, I'm not going to go out and buy it just because he gives it a 10.

404
00:25:56,196 --> 00:25:58,397
[SPEAKER_03]: I have to look at the reasons why he's giving it a 10.

405
00:25:59,678 --> 00:25:59,998
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

406
00:26:00,679 --> 00:26:04,121
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a good test so I can save my $5 and not rent the thing.

407
00:26:04,942 --> 00:26:06,643
[SPEAKER_03]: But I don't know.

408
00:26:06,963 --> 00:26:11,826
[SPEAKER_03]: I really, most of the time when it comes down to reviews, I don't really listen to reviews.

409
00:26:11,886 --> 00:26:14,268
[SPEAKER_03]: It's more buzz that I've heard about the game beforehand.

410
00:26:14,907 --> 00:26:15,107
[SPEAKER_03]: Angel

411
00:26:36,942 --> 00:26:45,849
[SPEAKER_01]: Pretty much what Loki said is what I do, except for the fact that I'll go to a friend's house or something that already bought it right away and I'll try it there.

412
00:26:46,449 --> 00:26:51,113
[SPEAKER_01]: It's pretty much a visual review, pretty much.

413
00:26:51,973 --> 00:26:52,814
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I'm trying to say.

414
00:26:53,154 --> 00:26:54,995
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, you review by watching somebody else.

415
00:26:55,436 --> 00:26:58,038
[SPEAKER_01]: Or trying it myself afterwards and whatever.

416
00:26:59,078 --> 00:27:05,503
[SPEAKER_01]: Usually, probably about 95% of the time, I will end up getting the game that I try because it's just crazy.

417
00:27:05,774 --> 00:27:06,455
[SPEAKER_01]: I Ask My Friends

418
00:27:20,868 --> 00:27:22,109
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I feel very similar.

419
00:27:22,849 --> 00:27:25,990
[SPEAKER_04]: Buzz does a lot more for me than an actual review.

420
00:27:26,171 --> 00:27:31,913
[SPEAKER_04]: Although, I have bought games based on reviews, but not necessarily because it got a glowing review.

421
00:27:31,973 --> 00:27:33,994
[SPEAKER_04]: Because everybody likes different types of games.

422
00:27:34,054 --> 00:27:39,397
[SPEAKER_04]: For instance, we don't talk a whole lot about sports-based games, although it's a huge market for gaming.

423
00:27:39,597 --> 00:27:40,137
[SPEAKER_04]: or FPS.

424
00:28:05,134 --> 00:28:08,075
[SPEAKER_04]: So maybe one of those games comes out and it gets a great score.

425
00:28:08,675 --> 00:28:13,177
[SPEAKER_04]: And perhaps it's a good game, but it's not really just the kind of game I want to play.

426
00:28:13,497 --> 00:28:17,258
[SPEAKER_04]: But at the same time, maybe a game comes out and it gets a pretty low score.

427
00:28:17,378 --> 00:28:22,140
[SPEAKER_04]: Case in point, DDR Ultramix 2 got a low score from one of those magazines out there.

428
00:28:23,580 --> 00:28:26,661
[SPEAKER_04]: But I say, yeah, Katamari even got some low scores out there.

429
00:28:26,701 --> 00:28:27,221
[SPEAKER_04]: Very few, though.

430
00:28:27,241 --> 00:28:28,882
[SPEAKER_04]: It was a pretty critically appreciated game.

431
00:28:30,086 --> 00:28:57,841
[SPEAKER_04]: but it's still you know I know I love that series of games so I'm going to pick it up anyway but sometimes there has been a game based on the review like maybe they have one on one of the TV networks they're reviewing a game and then I look at the game in motion I go oh that looks like kind of a cool game I want to pick that up like you remember Under the Skin we saw that on a review show I don't even think they gave it a good review but we were just like cool you can be an alien and like you know fuck with people so it looked like a cool game I played it all of one time

432
00:29:01,314 --> 00:29:04,875
