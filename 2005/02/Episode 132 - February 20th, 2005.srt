00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
You

3
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Thunder, rain and lightning, danger of water rising

4
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Lammasight, wailing in the train's last line

5
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:20,000
The shadows of dark creatures, steel clouds floating in the air

6
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
People lost their shelter

7
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
What's gonna happen to us?

8
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:32,000
All the steps we take, all the moves we make, all the pain and pain

9
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,000
I see the chaos through everyone

10
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Who are we? What can we do?

11
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Doing all the same

12
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
You ain't it?

13
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
We have our own style that we won't change

14
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
You're the man with the evil in life now

15
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:52,000
There is no way I could lose

16
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Can't hold on much longer

17
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,000
I will never let go

18
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,000
I know it's a one way track

19
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Tell me now how long this will last

20
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,000
I'm not gonna think this way

21
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Or will I count on others

22
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Close my eyes and feel it burn

23
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,000

Ancient city blazing

26
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Shadows keep attacking

27
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Little children crying

28
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Confusion, hopeless anger

29
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:44,000
I don't know what it could be, but you drive me crazy

30
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,000
All your cunning tricks make me sick

31
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:52,000
You won't pound it your own way

32
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Can't hold on much longer

33
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,000
But I will never let go

34
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,000

If it won't stop, there will be no future for us

00:10:55,220 --> 00:10:57,120
That is the best way to my heart.

110
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:58,120
Music and candy.

111
00:10:58,120 --> 00:10:59,120

120
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:16,040

122
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:25,040
orangelawnsradio.com

123
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:52,200

125
00:11:56,400 --> 00:12:02,400
awesome actually we broke out the ps1 today because we found that Dan's been

126
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:07,280
playing tempest X all day that's awesome as in the kind of crappy version of

127
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:13,320
tempest 2000 tempest is tempest my friend although tempest 2000 on the jack

128
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:20,520
was the best. Not on the Saturn. Tempest on the Jag was the only game worth getting a

129
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:28,120
Jag for. What about Defender 2000? Blah. No there was another, it was Alien vs. Predator.

130
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:33,680
I guess so, I guess so. That's about the only Alien vs. Predator thing worth even remotely

131
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:39,560
wasting your time with. The arcade game? Any arcade game, but not the movie. That was my

132
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:45,320

135
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:57,960
out of Bahmani stuff I guess we'll talk about other video game stuff because

136
00:12:57,960 --> 00:13:05,560
we're dorks we're gonna start off this break with a potpourri of Bahmani music

147
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:13,760
Just like a fool, I'm in the dark side

148
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:16,760
Got a full staff, and I'm fighting myself now

149
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:19,760
I'm in the dark side

150
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:24,760
Not do it, not do it, not do it

151
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:31,760
Not do it, not do it, not do it

152
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:33,760

00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:15,760
We are back here with more Orange Lounge Radio.

155
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:21,640
Hello boys and girls on this happy 220-2005.

156
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:23,920
That's a lot of twos and a lot of zeros.

157
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:24,920
Yeah.

158
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:26,800
Uh, I don't know.

159
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:28,120
I'm out of clever things to say.

160
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:29,600
There's a lot of zeros in the world.

161
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:31,360
Oh, you're not so echoey anymore.

162
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:32,360
Your echo went away.

163
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:33,360
Yeah, but I'm still sniffy.

164
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:41,120
I know there's been like disease going around. No, it's called someone decided to clean the upstairs room while I was in it. Okay

165
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:47,640
Yeah, and there was like a thick layer of dust. Yeah, it's pretty bad. All right. Well, you know it needed doing

166
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:51,400
I'm just was upset at the time. I'm a scared of moving out of this place

167
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:54,240
You know, the orange launch radio is studio is moving in April

168
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:58,620
So hopefully you'll have less of a drive to get to the orange launch studio Jamie

169
00:20:58,620 --> 00:21:04,200
me. Hopefully. Because the Orange Laundry Studios are moving and I fear what this place

170
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:09,180
is going to look like when we move everything. Probably going to find God knows what behind

171
00:21:09,180 --> 00:21:15,540
all this stuff, but that's part of the joy in moving is finding these rare treasures.

172
00:21:15,540 --> 00:21:20,620
You're looking very studio-like today with your headphones on. Am I? Thank you. It's

173
00:21:20,620 --> 00:21:23,620
too bad they can't see it on the webcam, but that's alright. We don't need the webcam.

174
00:21:23,620 --> 00:21:26,620
What's with the headphones today? Actually, I usually wear these headphones. You probably

175
00:21:26,620 --> 00:21:30,260
can't notice it because my hair is usually bigger and so it kind of hides

176
00:21:30,260 --> 00:21:33,220
the headphones because my hair is so huge but since I got a haircut you can't

177
00:21:33,220 --> 00:21:37,580
see the headphones so well. That's right you weren't here last week because I got

178
00:21:37,580 --> 00:21:42,500
my hair cut just before last week's show. So speaking of last week we'll start off

179
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:46,100
tonight's show by asking how was your week how was your day Dark Sacra? I don't

180
00:21:46,100 --> 00:21:50,860
even remember what I did last weekend. I know I had to do something. Oh yeah it

181
00:21:50,860 --> 00:21:58,780
it was celebrating Valentine's Day. I'm so bad. Didn't you say the man was listening

182
00:21:58,780 --> 00:22:04,200
tonight too? Yeah, I am. Whoops! Whoops! Um, seriously though, we went to Claim Jumper

183
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:09,860
for dinner, and ate like everything in sight, and I had chocolate cream cheese pie. I wish

184
00:22:09,860 --> 00:22:13,100
I was in a relationship so I could go to Claim Jumper. You could go to Claim Jumper anyway.

185
00:22:13,100 --> 00:22:17,980
I know, but maybe somebody else would pay for it. I could just put out and get it paid

186
00:22:17,980 --> 00:22:25,580
for it. Hold up a little piece of a box. We'll give special favors for Claim Jumper. Exactly.

187
00:22:25,580 --> 00:22:32,560
It's worth it, too. I'm not a whore. Claim Jumper's worth it. I got one of the favorite

188
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:40,660
things, whatever they call it, and I had the potato cakes and everything, and I had, it's

189
00:22:40,660 --> 00:22:45,780
like a half a chicken, and I took the rest of the chicken home. I like the leg. I was

190
00:22:45,780 --> 00:22:52,480
and they gave me a free cup of soup. Dan got like, for his appetizer, he got like a chili

191
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:57,360
in the bread bowl. And I'm sitting here with my little cup of soup going, huh, soup. I'm

192
00:22:57,360 --> 00:23:01,160
sitting there staring at his bowl and eating part of it and it's like, there's no point

193
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:04,800
you should be sitting there staring at his food here, have another cup. I was like, thank

194
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:05,960
you, you get a good sip.

195
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:11,640
Aw, that's nice. Claim Jumper has the best potato cheddar soup in the world, in the world.

196
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:16,840
It has pieces of, uh, of, uh, slightly overcooked, uh, potato skin in it.

197
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:17,340
Yeah.

198
00:23:17,340 --> 00:23:18,140
Because it's crunchy.

199
00:23:18,140 --> 00:23:20,840
For those who don't know what claims number is, because they don't have it everywhere, I think they only have it-

200
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:21,840
I think it's only in California.

201
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:27,340
Well, I think there- it's in other states too, but mostly on the West Coast, I'm not sure, but I know they don't have it everywhere,

202
00:23:27,340 --> 00:23:35,140
but basically it's- it's this giant log cabin themed restaurant, but the portions are like, they kill the buffalo out back and put it on your plate.

203
00:23:35,140 --> 00:23:37,340
I mean, seriously. This is how big it is.

204
00:23:37,340 --> 00:23:43,340
I didn't really do anything too Bimani-related. I played some Silent Hill 3.

205
00:23:43,340 --> 00:23:49,340
Silent Hill 4 is sorta, eh, creepy. Just sort of annoying creepy.

206
00:23:49,340 --> 00:23:52,340
Silent Hill 3 starts off like, shit your pants creepy.

207
00:23:52,340 --> 00:23:57,340
I screamed like a girl at one part of Silent Hill 4. It's a different kind of scare, I think.

208
00:23:57,340 --> 00:24:03,340
Silent Hill 3, dude. I only got as far as the first part of it, the dream part.

209
00:24:03,340 --> 00:24:09,340
But it was like, you know what, the Uzi in that game is so ridiculously not useful.

210
00:24:09,340 --> 00:24:11,340
I was like, ooh, a handgun, shoot the dog.

211
00:24:11,340 --> 00:24:15,340
Well, that's always the weird thing about Silent Hill is you don't, you can't really kill things.

212
00:24:15,340 --> 00:24:21,340
I mean, you can, but it's more, and that's kind of what really bugged me about Silent Hill when I first played it, too,

213
00:24:21,340 --> 00:24:23,340
because it's such a different type of game.

214
00:24:23,340 --> 00:24:27,340
And it's like, you know, my instinct when I play a video game is to kill everything.

215
00:24:27,340 --> 00:24:29,340
But in Silent Hill, you don't have enough ammo to kill everything.

216
00:24:29,340 --> 00:24:32,780
to kill everything. You have to be all Metal Gear Solid about it and you have to sneak

217
00:24:32,780 --> 00:24:37,940
by zombies and just run like hell. But that is so not the way I usually play adventure

218
00:24:37,940 --> 00:24:41,820
games. I want to explore every little corner. I want to kill everything because it might

219
00:24:41,820 --> 00:24:44,820
drop something I need. But that's not the same mindset you can approach a downhill game.

220
00:24:44,820 --> 00:24:51,340
I wasn't spoiling shit. Stop saying I spoiled anything.

221
00:24:51,340 --> 00:24:53,220
Don't listen to that Sharon.

222
00:24:53,220 --> 00:24:57,420
Anyway, Dan bought me roses.

223
00:24:57,420 --> 00:25:00,620
I came home from work the other day, and they were roses.

224
00:25:00,620 --> 00:25:02,940
Wait, now I believe, and I could find this, too,

225
00:25:02,940 --> 00:25:04,220
in an earlier podcast.

226
00:25:04,220 --> 00:25:05,740
You said something to, I remember

227
00:25:05,740 --> 00:25:07,420
in one of the podcasts, you said,

228
00:25:07,420 --> 00:25:09,540
I don't need roses, not flowery girl shit.

229
00:25:09,540 --> 00:25:11,380
My man buys me Silent Hill.

230
00:25:11,380 --> 00:25:15,460
Well, I'm really not very girly girly

231
00:25:15,460 --> 00:25:16,740
when it comes to relationships.

232
00:25:16,740 --> 00:25:20,360
But every so often, I want something sweet.

233
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:22,780
I have to have my dose of sugar in the relationship,

234
00:25:22,780 --> 00:25:28,420
else I start you know getting lethargic you know without something to keep my I

235
00:25:28,420 --> 00:25:33,420
guess relationship blood sugar up or something you can't use Splenda for that

236
00:25:33,420 --> 00:25:39,180
no Splenda so he came home and gave me this box it's really long box I'm

237
00:25:39,180 --> 00:25:43,380
thinking oh well it's got like a poster in it or something and there were

238
00:25:43,380 --> 00:25:51,860
there's a dozen pink roses in it oh I know I feel all spoiled and special you

239
00:25:51,860 --> 00:25:58,500
are spoiled that's all right thank you but if you weren't spoiled you wouldn't

240
00:25:58,500 --> 00:26:02,340
bring that same charm to the show I don't think now you would you'd be

241
00:26:02,340 --> 00:26:17,620
charming either way shut up Rob you can stop shutting up now okay hi hi but

242
00:26:17,620 --> 00:26:21,900
that's that's really it we've been going through the old system stuff I found

243
00:26:21,900 --> 00:26:27,340
Dan found my copy of cotton for the PC engine duo so I have this feeling that

244
00:26:27,340 --> 00:26:30,140
tomorrow I'm gonna be breaking out the turbo graphics and playing a lot of

245
00:26:30,140 --> 00:26:34,660
cotton which is it's they came out actually on the Neo Geo pocket color in

246
00:26:34,660 --> 00:26:38,580
the States I think but it's a game where you play as the little witch riding her

247
00:26:38,580 --> 00:26:44,780
broom and she's addicted this candy that makes her throw up called willow it's

248
00:26:44,780 --> 00:26:53,220
funny and then she goes WEE-LAW! So, anyway, I'm done. Yay. Alright, Angel, how was your

249
00:26:53,220 --> 00:27:01,140
week? How was your day? Monday was... Monday. Yeah. I got chocolate and stuff. Is that new?

250
00:27:01,140 --> 00:27:06,820
Yes, that's new. He's pointing at my neck. Angel's got a heart around her neck. It's

251
00:27:06,820 --> 00:27:12,140
a little gold heart. I wonder where that came from. Hee hee. Tee hee, tee hee. Yeah, Magus's

252
00:27:12,140 --> 00:27:14,140
fall alright it's all good

253
00:27:14,140 --> 00:27:16,420
um...

254
00:27:16,420 --> 00:27:19,460
geez I don't remember what really happened this week

255
00:27:19,460 --> 00:27:24,700
aside from that and then you know school and work and stuff and

256
00:27:24,700 --> 00:27:28,980
and Rob's looking at his caps and playing with them

257
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:30,340
yeah actually

258
00:27:30,340 --> 00:27:33,100
yeah he's got a couple songs to get now yay

259
00:27:33,100 --> 00:27:34,580
and uh...

260
00:27:34,580 --> 00:27:37,700
by the way I drank way too much soda this week for that

261
00:27:37,700 --> 00:27:38,940
so like

262
00:27:38,940 --> 00:27:40,500
you know

263
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:54,500
Contrary to popular belief, as much as I like people to do things for me, you don't have to drink all that Pepsi to win me free songs. Seriously, moderation, honey, it's okay. I'll just take what you have extra. It's all good.

264
00:27:54,500 --> 00:27:56,500
Who said it was all regular soda?

265
00:27:56,500 --> 00:28:01,500
Still, still. Water's good too. You can do the water once in a while.

266
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:27,500
Of course. Anyway, um, god, not much went on really. I mean, I played some games but not much. Oh yeah, and then the internet went out, dammit. Two days later, um, two days later and some, uh, phone calls. We finally have internet back, so that's good. And, um, I don't know what else happened this week. It just went by way too quick.

267
00:28:27,500 --> 00:28:28,500
week.

268
00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:31,780
Alright, then I guess you're done.

269
00:28:31,780 --> 00:28:35,500
Well, Loki looks like he's cooking, so I guess I'll talk about my week.

270
00:28:35,500 --> 00:28:38,260
My Valentine's Day, now I'm the single bitch in here.

271
00:28:38,260 --> 00:28:39,260
Everybody else is in a relationship.

272
00:28:39,260 --> 00:28:40,260
I'm the single bitch.

273
00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:41,260
That's fine.

274
00:28:41,260 --> 00:28:42,260
I'm okay with that.

275
00:28:42,260 --> 00:28:43,260
Hey, hey.

276
00:28:43,260 --> 00:28:44,260
I said he's lollipops.

277
00:28:44,260 --> 00:28:45,260
Alright.

278
00:28:45,260 --> 00:28:52,660
You did, but for Valentine's Day, actually one of my buddies had a little cook-over thing.

279
00:28:52,660 --> 00:28:54,900
Like he cooked dinner for a bunch of single people.

280
00:28:54,900 --> 00:28:57,420
He had like a singles dinner, which I think is really nice.

281
00:28:57,420 --> 00:28:58,420
That's a very good idea.

282
00:28:58,420 --> 00:29:00,760
It was very nice and very sweet, so I was happy that he did that.

283
00:29:00,760 --> 00:29:05,320
So he gave me something to do on Valentine's Day where I didn't feel lonely.

284
00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:08,580
And I didn't even have to put out, and I didn't have to buy flowers for anybody.

285
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:12,840
So it was great.

286
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:15,700
So I got steak on Valentine's Day.

287
00:29:15,700 --> 00:29:16,700
How great is that?

288
00:29:16,700 --> 00:29:18,620
I got homemade steak on Valentine's Day.

289
00:29:18,620 --> 00:29:19,960
It's awesome.

290
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:20,960
So...

291
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:22,140
Because beef is love.

292
00:29:22,140 --> 00:29:25,080
Seriously, it is.

293
00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:28,040
I know you perverts, not that kind of meat, meat.

294
00:29:28,040 --> 00:29:29,040
Bastards.

295
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:32,960
Let's see, what else did I do this week?

296
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:37,400
I played a lot of WarioWare Touched, because I bought it on the DS on Tuesday, the day

297
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:38,400
it came out.

298
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:41,560
Because, you know, I was all excited for a new WarioWare game.

299
00:29:41,560 --> 00:29:45,860
And there was a side of me where I was kind of like, what if they do the Nintendo thing

300
00:29:45,860 --> 00:29:49,460
and just recycle the same garbage again, I have to play the same damn minigames.

301
00:29:49,460 --> 00:29:52,840
But they're all new and that made me so happy, so I'll gush about that more on this week's

302
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:54,000
podcast.

303
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:58,340
definitely check that out if you haven't yet. Orioware is awesome. I'm very happy

304
00:29:58,340 --> 00:30:03,380
with it. There are some downsides to it though, so I'll talk about it later. And then

305
00:30:03,380 --> 00:30:06,420
I was doing a little bit of retro gaming too as well. I've been playing a little

306
00:30:06,420 --> 00:30:08,700
more of the emulator. I don't know why I've been getting so back into that

307
00:30:08,700 --> 00:30:12,820
lately. I think it's because like I've been trying to spend a little more

308
00:30:12,820 --> 00:30:15,980
gaming time with things other than Final Fantasy 11, although I've been playing

309
00:30:15,980 --> 00:30:20,700
that a little bit too. I actually went on Xbox Live for the first time in like two

310
00:30:20,700 --> 00:30:23,780
months, and so I found these people that were adding me as friends, and they

311
00:30:23,780 --> 00:30:27,380
probably had wondered if I thought the face of the earth or what but I finally

312
00:30:27,380 --> 00:30:34,760
added him back so hi and I decided to play Halo 2 online and I got killed so

313
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:39,600
so bad I came in last place and like seventh place which is next last place

314
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:43,840
and like twice as many kills as I did that is how sad it was I was just not

315
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:48,080
meant to play Halo or any first-person shooter for that matter I don't think

316
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:51,280
otherwise what did I end up doing in real life last night I went out to the

317
00:30:51,280 --> 00:30:57,080
casino and I lost $60 but you know that's okay because I'm gonna win it all

318
00:30:57,080 --> 00:31:03,160
back next time I'm gonna win it all back and I went to the buffet biggest buffets

319
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:06,400
are awesome and you know when I went out to lunch with an old friend of mine

320
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:09,280
today I went out to lunch with Julie today and she was saying you know when

321
00:31:09,280 --> 00:31:12,440
people say that they're going to the casino to go to the buffet that's just

322
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:16,600
codes that's just code words for gambling and I'm like yeah sadly it is

323
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:18,600
I go before the buffet.

324
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:21,600
I only gambled a dollar.

325
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:23,600
But you gambled.

326
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:25,600
That's because I was bored. I was waiting for you to lose your seventy.

327
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:29,600
Well you know what sucks is that I lost sixty dollars in like fifteen minutes.

328
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:34,600
My buddy's playing pie gal poker, which I'd never heard of in my life, but I learned how to play by watching him.

329
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:39,600
And he was there for like forty-five minutes and lost nine dollars. Nine.

330
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:43,600
I lose sixty in a third of the time.

331
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:45,600
Life sucks.

332
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:51,600
I do. The chat room is saying you suck at gambling. I do suck at gambling. I'm just, I should stop. I really need to stop.

333
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:53,600
But it's so addicting.

334
00:31:56,600 --> 00:31:58,600
Loki, how was your week? How was your day?

335
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:04,600
He's getting his food finished up before he can talk on the microphone here.

336
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:09,600
Is that still on cam? www.OrangeLoungeRadio.com? Our amazing Orange Lounge kitchen?

337
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:13,600
Actually, we can't hear you, bud. Turn on the mic.

338
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:20,600
Yes, it has a shot of the empty walk at the moment, which will be full.

339
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:24,600
Well, had a cold this week, that sucked.

340
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:27,600
I saw Constantine, that was pretty good.

341
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:31,600
Played lots of Final Fantasy, that was pretty cool.

342
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:38,600
And then, to top it all off, in the final nail in the coffin, my power supply goes out of my computer.

343
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:39,600
That sucked.

344
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:49,420
and so yeah so pretty much today was I was being very lethargic just like slept

345
00:32:49,420 --> 00:32:54,860
for 10 hours got up ate some waffles watched ghosts in the shell two

346
00:32:54,860 --> 00:32:58,540
innocents I actually watched one of my movies I got surprisingly enough and

347
00:32:58,540 --> 00:33:04,100
then slept for another three hours or I don't even know it slept for an hour or

348
00:33:04,100 --> 00:33:09,580
so I don't know why and now because I just realized I haven't had any actual

349
00:33:09,580 --> 00:33:14,820
protein in my body for a while and I kind of feel faint so I had to cook food

350
00:33:14,820 --> 00:33:20,620
and that's that was my week. When was the last time you ate? This morning I had

351
00:33:20,620 --> 00:33:25,380
waffles. Oh yeah waffles but no protein. No protein and waffles. Unfortunately not

352
00:33:25,380 --> 00:33:32,820
there's... Just waffle goodness. Waffle and Aunt Jemima. No protein and Aunt Jemima

353
00:33:32,820 --> 00:33:38,980
either or her syrup anyway. No her syrup has no protein in it. It's not very

354
00:33:38,980 --> 00:33:47,580
tangy either. Antimima might have protein in her though, but...anyway. Oh, and then

355
00:33:47,580 --> 00:33:53,460
we have another person who's knocking on the door, so... It's explicit! You know that knocker's

356
00:33:53,460 --> 00:33:58,180
just for decorative purposes, actually. Dude, I just found a neat link on somebody's picture.

357
00:33:58,180 --> 00:34:02,500
Alright, I'm done. Tell us about it. Alright, thanks, Logie. The Online Entomology Dictionary.

358
00:34:02,500 --> 00:34:08,540
That's pretty cool. And I guess just because I'm the only real nerd here that only I really

359
00:34:08,540 --> 00:34:12,160
would find that to be a cool thing well our listeners might be nerdy too you

360
00:34:12,160 --> 00:34:16,780
never know I'll link it in the chat room alright explicit since you just walked

361
00:34:16,780 --> 00:34:21,860
in why not tell us about your week in your day this week was been good and bad

362
00:34:21,860 --> 00:34:27,340
been busy throughout the whole time doing nothing but homework of course I'm

363
00:34:27,340 --> 00:34:33,620
taking like 15 units of class and I have two jobs so pretty hectic hey I heard

364
00:34:33,620 --> 00:34:39,620
I heard you ran into Magus this week in the arcade.

365
00:34:39,620 --> 00:34:42,620
Uh, what the hell?

366
00:34:42,620 --> 00:34:46,620
At school.

367
00:34:46,620 --> 00:34:49,620
A.R.C., you guys are playing Initial D or something?

368
00:34:49,620 --> 00:34:52,620
I don't play Initial D.

369
00:34:52,620 --> 00:34:57,620
This Dead Air was brought to you by a DDR Angel story.

370
00:34:57,620 --> 00:35:00,620
Hey, that's what I heard.

371
00:35:00,620 --> 00:35:04,620
Okay, whatever.

372
00:35:04,620 --> 00:35:08,620
Let's see, I did not get a chance to go to that tournament this Saturday.

373
00:35:08,620 --> 00:35:12,620
Oh yeah, that's right, there was another DDR tournament I didn't go to.

374
00:35:12,620 --> 00:35:16,620
I heard about it though. I heard about what happened at the tournament though.

375
00:35:16,620 --> 00:35:18,620
Ooh, what happened, Drama?

376
00:35:18,620 --> 00:35:23,620
Well, there's some good and bad stuff. Good was, it was a decent tournament and stuff, as far as I'm hearing.

377
00:35:23,620 --> 00:35:29,620
They've actually broadcasted a commercial for Marsh Madness.

378
00:35:29,620 --> 00:35:34,020
They did a commercial, like a little... No, no, they did like an intermission.

379
00:35:34,020 --> 00:35:38,220
Oh, okay. To talk about, um, March Madness 2K3

380
00:35:38,220 --> 00:35:41,740
with a combination of freestyle... March Madness 2003?

381
00:35:41,740 --> 00:35:44,820
I think... 2005, sorry. I think...

382
00:35:44,820 --> 00:35:48,820
Oh damn, I think we're a couple years late. I think we missed it.

383
00:35:48,820 --> 00:35:52,860
Sorry. That's alright. Anyways. What are they having it this year? March Madness always... Milpitas.

384
00:35:52,860 --> 00:35:57,780
Milpitas. But, uh, but, but, okay, now to go to the bad part of this...

385
00:35:57,780 --> 00:36:00,080
Wait, they had a Milpitas last year, didn't they?

386
00:36:00,080 --> 00:36:00,580
Yeah.

387
00:36:00,580 --> 00:36:02,380
I thought it was supposed to move around.

388
00:36:02,380 --> 00:36:05,580
But now they're going to the bad part about the whole tournament.

389
00:36:05,580 --> 00:36:08,080
Ooh, yay, drama, drama.

390
00:36:08,080 --> 00:36:13,780
According to what I've been hearing, the manager, Paul, in Milpitas Golf...

391
00:36:13,780 --> 00:36:15,880
Wait a minute, before you finish that sentence,

392
00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:20,980
the views and opinions expressed by Explicit are strictly his own and not those of Orange Law's Radio. Finish.

393
00:36:20,980 --> 00:36:23,980
Okay, what the...

394
00:36:23,980 --> 00:36:30,980
Okay, the manager in Milpitas Golf Land screwed the pads over.

395
00:36:30,980 --> 00:36:36,560
I heard there's people who are getting 10 misses in a song, or 12, there was no full

396
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:39,100
combo throughout the whole tournament.

397
00:36:39,100 --> 00:36:40,100
Awesome.

398
00:36:40,100 --> 00:36:47,540
That's how bad the freaking pads were.

399
00:36:47,540 --> 00:36:53,620
Which also concerns me about Martial Madness 2K5, if the same result would happen again.

400
00:36:53,620 --> 00:36:56,620
Are they going to do DDR Idol in March Madness 2K5?

401
00:36:56,620 --> 00:37:00,620
Not this time. They're doing Freestyle Revolution Plus.

402
00:37:00,620 --> 00:37:05,620
No. Hey. No. As in Mike. No. You listening?

403
00:37:05,620 --> 00:37:10,620
I want DDR Idol. Now. Do it. Do it. Do it. Thank you.

404
00:37:10,620 --> 00:37:11,620
I'm not the one organizing it.

405
00:37:11,620 --> 00:37:13,620
I know. That's why I'm just putting out that special message.

406
00:37:13,620 --> 00:37:15,620
Do they have people in the Speed of Two or the one in April?

407
00:37:15,620 --> 00:37:18,620
The upcoming Sacramento tournament in April.

408
00:37:18,620 --> 00:37:20,620
We need another DDR Idol.

409
00:37:20,620 --> 00:37:29,620
Oh, speaking of tournament in April, somebody is actually in the process of organizing a tournament at that month in Sacramento.

410
00:37:29,620 --> 00:37:30,620
And it's not you?

411
00:37:30,620 --> 00:37:31,620
Not me.

412
00:37:31,620 --> 00:37:33,620
Oh, wow. Who's doing it?

413
00:37:33,620 --> 00:37:37,620
A friend of mine named DJ Aero. He's on the forums.

414
00:37:37,620 --> 00:37:38,620
Okay.

415
00:37:38,620 --> 00:37:42,620
Yeah, he wanted to go through the process of tournament organizing and stuff.

416
00:37:42,620 --> 00:37:44,620
Good luck! Good luck, kid!

417
00:37:44,620 --> 00:37:46,620
Have fun!

418
00:37:46,620 --> 00:37:50,620
It's not an easy path, but I have faith in him.

419
00:37:50,620 --> 00:37:52,620
No, it's really not easy.

420
00:37:52,620 --> 00:37:58,620
If he puts the time and effort into it, it'll be a good tourney. I don't doubt.

421
00:37:58,620 --> 00:38:02,620
Remember when we did tourneys, Janie? Did I say Janie?

422
00:38:02,620 --> 00:38:09,620
Yep. And this is as long as people can accept criticism without taking it personally?

423
00:38:09,620 --> 00:38:15,620
Sorry. I know, I know, I know. That was an issue back then, but...

424
00:38:15,620 --> 00:38:17,620
That was an issue a few weeks ago.

425
00:38:17,620 --> 00:38:28,620
Yeah, but there was a lot of heat and drama. There was like so much heat and drama at the time that I hope that it does not happen in July.

426
00:38:28,620 --> 00:38:37,620
Yeah, I made mistakes. I admit I made mistakes, but I admit my mistakes and learn from it and hopefully it doesn't happen.

427
00:38:37,620 --> 00:38:41,620
Good for you that you can admit that we've all made mistakes.

428
00:38:41,620 --> 00:39:01,620
A lot of things went through a tournament organizing itself. There's always going to be a conflict, an unexpected conflict that you may not be able to do, because it could be the pad issue, but sometimes the place may restrict you from doing certain things.

429
00:39:01,620 --> 00:39:06,140
I say next time there's a clause written into the contract that says

430
00:39:06,140 --> 00:39:10,140
or you know the the gaming thing that says if the pads break down during the

431
00:39:10,140 --> 00:39:10,700
tournament

432
00:39:10,700 --> 00:39:14,580
the tournament will instantly become a whack-a-mole competition and we'll just all play

433
00:39:14,580 --> 00:39:15,260
whack-a-mole

434
00:39:15,260 --> 00:39:20,020
because whack-a-mole is awesome. Well if there isn't really a big pad error on one side you can try

435
00:39:20,020 --> 00:39:20,620
doing it

436
00:39:20,620 --> 00:39:25,340
on the other. Unless if both sides are messed up.

437
00:39:25,340 --> 00:39:29,140
That's what happened at our first SACO tourney is that one of the

438
00:39:29,140 --> 00:39:36,140
sides was screwing up, so we ended up having to do PA all on one side, which, you know,

439
00:39:36,140 --> 00:39:41,020
it made things go a little longer, but at the same time, we were on schedule, I think,

440
00:39:41,020 --> 00:39:45,020
this was years ago, but I think it ended up being on schedule anyway, so we weren't too

441
00:39:45,020 --> 00:39:51,060
bad, but it was just kind of a bummer that that had to happen, you know, but, crap happens.

442
00:39:51,060 --> 00:39:52,060
It happens.

443
00:39:52,060 --> 00:39:55,620
But if both pads, like I said, if both pads don't function, then you can't really run

444
00:39:55,620 --> 00:40:00,100
tournament or just or I don't even know what's gonna happen right there

445
00:40:00,100 --> 00:40:04,460
what does the Milpitas have like 50 machines DER machines they can use?

446
00:40:04,460 --> 00:40:11,460
unfortunately it's under Paul or MGL's management manager itself it means this

447
00:40:11,460 --> 00:40:15,020
is what the reason why I mean hearing why did they not switch the pads the

448
00:40:15,020 --> 00:40:19,260
intergroove pads which is almost in good condition I don't like anyone plays in the

449
00:40:19,260 --> 00:40:25,020
groove I heard according to what I'm hearing from the sources I'm hearing

450
00:40:25,020 --> 00:40:28,020
In The Group makes a lot more money than DDR in Milpitas.

451
00:40:28,020 --> 00:40:31,020
Well, I'm not surprised, because there's no new DDR game.

452
00:40:31,020 --> 00:40:37,020
And the fact that they did not use the In The Group pads for that tournament makes me wonder what happened.

453
00:40:39,020 --> 00:40:43,020
I mean, they're extreme in 4th plus with the messed up pads, so...

454
00:40:46,020 --> 00:40:48,020
But anyways, let's move on. Sorry if I...

455
00:40:48,020 --> 00:40:53,020
No, that's alright. Don't listen to the chat room. Don't listen to the chat room.

456
00:40:53,020 --> 00:40:57,020
Here you go, Jamie. Here's some Advil.

457
00:40:57,020 --> 00:41:01,020
Or you can watch Willy Cook.

458
00:41:01,020 --> 00:41:05,020
We can learn from tournament drama.

459
00:41:05,020 --> 00:41:09,020
Is anybody going to E3? I want to.

460
00:41:09,020 --> 00:41:13,020
I know that Jamie and Matt are, but I have to do the business stuff for Orange Lounge still,

461
00:41:13,020 --> 00:41:17,020
which I need to get up off my ass and do this week.

462
00:41:17,020 --> 00:41:21,020
But I want to go. Why? Why are you asking?

463
00:41:21,020 --> 00:41:25,020
a group of people going to E3 and stuff, if possible.

464
00:41:25,020 --> 00:41:27,020
I'll be at E3, but I'm going with DDRFreak.

465
00:41:27,020 --> 00:41:32,020
Yeah, I'll be at E3, but, I mean, I have no- I'm too early to plan.

466
00:41:32,020 --> 00:41:39,020
Hey, who never knows? Who knows if the tickets will cost more, like, later on? I'm not really sure.

467
00:41:39,020 --> 00:41:45,020
Well, you can pay to get in if you got a couple hundred bucks sitting around, but, you know, you're supposed to

468
00:41:45,020 --> 00:41:47,020
get the hookup by having some game companies.

469
00:41:47,020 --> 00:41:56,020
I know like, I know like places like Gamestop, EB, and various other gaming companies, or as long as you have an access to like a gaming, or any interest of gaming itself.

470
00:41:56,020 --> 00:42:00,020
I had friends that went under EB Games and Gamestop, I've seen that.

471
00:42:00,020 --> 00:42:04,020
I know about, I know people too, as well, so.

472
00:42:04,020 --> 00:42:05,020
Well, we'll see.

473
00:42:05,020 --> 00:42:13,020
You can even say that you have a website dedicated to games, even though you don't have it.

474
00:42:13,020 --> 00:42:19,520
Now, now wait a minute, wait a minute. It is kind of hard to get in on a website, trust me, I know from experience,

475
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:27,020
because we have a problem proving Orange Lounge Radio is a legit gaming thing, even though, God, we promote the hell out of certain video games,

476
00:42:27,020 --> 00:42:38,520
and our podcast is more popular than what we're doing here right now, so, you know, and it's listened to by quite a few people, but we're still, we're still just a hobby, I guess.

477
00:42:38,520 --> 00:42:40,020
Hmm.

478
00:42:40,020 --> 00:42:41,020
I don't know.

479
00:42:41,020 --> 00:42:46,020
Because I don't know if someone I knew who had a fake website and went into E3 for some, somehow.

480
00:42:46,020 --> 00:42:50,020
If you know who did, if you know what to do, I guess it's possible.

481
00:42:50,020 --> 00:42:55,020
But I don't, I'm not good with that stuff, like bargaining and dealing my way in, so.

482
00:42:55,020 --> 00:42:59,020
Hmm.

483
00:42:59,020 --> 00:43:03,020
Alright. Well anyway, what we're going to do is we're going to go to a break, we're going to come back,

484
00:43:03,020 --> 00:43:08,020
and then we're going to talk about some more Bomani news, I guess, if we have any to talk about this week.

485
00:43:08,020 --> 00:43:14,300
something. And all your favorite Orange Lounge Radio segments when we come back after this

486
00:43:14,300 --> 00:43:19,820
little break featuring another mix of various songs from various CDR mixes. We'll be back.

487
00:43:19,820 --> 00:43:26,820
listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

488
00:45:19,820 --> 00:45:24,820
To be or to be on my side

489
00:46:54,820 --> 00:46:56,820
Yeah

490
00:48:24,820 --> 00:48:38,260
Every time I lose my self-control It feels like I can't let you go

491
00:48:38,260 --> 00:48:48,900
I'm at the point of no return You don't ever wanna come back down

492
00:48:48,900 --> 00:48:52,400
I'm not so high up on the ground

493
00:48:52,400 --> 00:48:55,900
This feeling I will always do

494
00:48:55,900 --> 00:48:57,900
Do, do, do, do, do

495
00:48:57,900 --> 00:48:59,900
Getting away

496
00:48:59,900 --> 00:49:01,900
I'm flying

497
00:49:01,900 --> 00:49:04,900
I'm gonna head for paradise

498
00:49:04,900 --> 00:49:06,900
Nothing to say

499
00:49:06,900 --> 00:49:08,900
I'm climbing

500
00:49:08,900 --> 00:49:12,260
I wanna stay right here tonight

501
00:49:38,900 --> 00:50:06,300
And now, let's listen in to an Orange Lounge Radio staff meeting as they debate some of

502
00:50:06,300 --> 00:50:09,580
the new programming coming to Orange Lounge Radio.

503
00:50:09,580 --> 00:50:14,340
Um, Jamie, I have a suggestion about some of the music in our Bomani Music & More program,

504
00:50:14,340 --> 00:50:15,560
can we talk about that?

505
00:50:15,560 --> 00:50:17,740
No subject will ever be taboo.

506
00:50:17,740 --> 00:50:22,380
Well, I was thinking maybe we should move, pump up the volume from Tuesday nights?

507
00:50:22,380 --> 00:50:25,220
Except of course the subject that was just under discussion.

508
00:50:25,220 --> 00:50:30,020
Okay, well, what would you think if maybe we cut back on some of the tack music we play

509
00:50:30,020 --> 00:50:31,100
on the station?

510
00:50:31,100 --> 00:50:34,780
I collect your fucking head.

511
00:50:34,780 --> 00:50:41,780
Oh my god, why did you do that to Loki? The holic thing on episode 69 was just a joke!

512
00:50:41,780 --> 00:50:48,780
Now if any of you sons of bitches got anything else to say, now's the fucking time!

513
00:50:48,780 --> 00:50:54,780
Orange Lounge Radio, where everybody has a say.

514
00:50:54,780 --> 00:50:56,780
where everybody has a say.

515
00:51:24,780 --> 00:51:27,840
just be ready for that you want more information on getting in on the

516
00:51:27,840 --> 00:51:32,980
skyline www.orangelandtrader.com click on interact with us hey while you're on

517
00:51:32,980 --> 00:51:38,100
our website check out the podcast which by the way has been taken off quite a

518
00:51:38,100 --> 00:51:41,420
little bit of popularity it looks like so I'm very excited about that we've

519
00:51:41,420 --> 00:51:44,580
been downloaded a lot of time so it's a good time the podcast is a good time and

520
00:51:44,580 --> 00:51:48,700
you can take that show with with you uh everywhere you go and it's not the same

521
00:51:48,700 --> 00:51:54,180
it's not the rehashed crap we do here it's it's new crap so enjoy that how you

522
00:51:54,180 --> 00:51:56,180
What are you doing over there, DarkSakura? You good?

523
00:51:56,180 --> 00:51:58,180
I'm a little sniffy again.

524
00:51:58,180 --> 00:52:00,180
Oh, I'm sorry to hear it.

525
00:52:00,180 --> 00:52:04,180
Alright, before we get into what's going on with the match game,

526
00:52:04,180 --> 00:52:08,180
I thought we could talk about what's going on in the Bamani world,

527
00:52:08,180 --> 00:52:11,180
and a little bit of maybe the general gaming world as well.

528
00:52:11,180 --> 00:52:14,180
Loki, you heard something about what's going on with DDR.

529
00:52:14,180 --> 00:52:19,180
Apparently, there is a new DDR game out in arcades.

530
00:52:19,180 --> 00:52:21,180
But don't get excited just yet, kids.

531
00:52:21,180 --> 00:52:23,180
Yeah, it's another bootleg.

532
00:52:23,180 --> 00:52:25,180
Okay, well, give us some detail.

533
00:52:26,180 --> 00:52:27,680
Okay. Well.

534
00:52:29,180 --> 00:52:32,180
Coming to a Namco arcade near you. Yes, Namco.

535
00:52:33,180 --> 00:52:39,180
Such proprietors as, um, the DDR Megamix and all the other shitty bootlegs that Namco buys.

536
00:52:39,180 --> 00:52:41,180
Um. Go Namco.

537
00:52:41,180 --> 00:52:43,180
Namco didn't make them. They just bought them.

538
00:52:43,180 --> 00:52:46,180
No, they buy them. They dumb enough to buy them, like, four times, okay?

539
00:52:46,180 --> 00:52:50,180
Anyways. So, they are stocking... I see there's...

540
00:52:50,180 --> 00:52:52,180
...hundreds of these things.

541
00:52:52,180 --> 00:52:59,460
coming out to an arcade near you and it's basically a PlayStation 2 inside of

542
00:52:59,460 --> 00:53:04,940
cabinet with some special hardware and it's running I kid you not the DDR

543
00:53:04,940 --> 00:53:11,580
extreme the US version so you've got that running in there and well it sucks

544
00:53:11,580 --> 00:53:16,540
the pads aren't even normal pads they're just the shitty internet or like the

545
00:53:16,540 --> 00:53:23,220
the ones you can get off of eBay, so they break really quick. It's just shit. That's

546
00:53:23,220 --> 00:53:29,740
all that needs to be said. So basically, is it the same, it's just DDR

547
00:53:29,740 --> 00:53:33,060
Extreme on PS2? It's running straight off of PS2.

548
00:53:33,060 --> 00:53:35,820
How does that work with the quarters and all the different modes and stuff?

549
00:53:35,820 --> 00:53:39,100
You can actually buy stuff, they have them like for Dreamcast and stuff like that. You

550
00:53:39,100 --> 00:53:45,140
can actually get where it has a whole quarter system and it'll lock the game out. I don't

551
00:53:45,140 --> 00:53:50,300
really know how that would work though as far as you know allowing you to push

552
00:53:50,300 --> 00:53:53,460
start and I think might be have something to do with pushing start the

553
00:53:53,460 --> 00:53:58,940
start button er and that's how it works I'm not really sure to be honest how but

554
00:53:58,940 --> 00:54:04,500
I've seen him out there they do exist but yeah there's been pictures circling

555
00:54:04,500 --> 00:54:12,940
around the internet and it's literally a ps2 inside of a cabinet I was trying to

556
00:54:12,940 --> 00:54:15,940
find more information on this over on freak or something I'm having our time

557
00:54:15,940 --> 00:54:19,860
finding the thread I know I saw something was it it was that where was

558
00:54:19,860 --> 00:54:23,540
that maybe I'll have to check this out it does it do the song speed up thing

559
00:54:23,540 --> 00:54:27,340
that the last one did because remember the last bootleg would like speed the

560
00:54:27,340 --> 00:54:31,780
song up by 20% it was supposed to be this great new challenge no no no this

561
00:54:31,780 --> 00:54:38,800
isn't even this is just a PlayStation 2 running DDR extreme the US version does

562
00:54:38,800 --> 00:54:44,800
Does it have the webcam? With the itoy type interface.

563
00:54:44,800 --> 00:54:48,800
Does it actually have an itoy hooked up? Nope.

564
00:54:48,800 --> 00:54:56,800
That's lame. And the thing is, I think people are trying to push it off as like DDR 9th mix or whatever.

565
00:54:56,800 --> 00:54:58,800
It's pretty lame.

566
00:54:58,800 --> 00:55:03,800
Okay, I found that post. It's over here on aaroninjapan.com if you want to check this out.

567
00:55:03,800 --> 00:55:09,700
It's called Namco, once again outdoes itself in stupidity, posted by WinDoo, WinDoe, I

568
00:55:09,700 --> 00:55:13,480
think it's supposed to be WinDoe, D-E-U, 32.

569
00:55:13,480 --> 00:55:17,800
Hey kids, it's the new DDR mix, no, not Megamix, no, not even Extreme Plus.

570
00:55:17,800 --> 00:55:23,600
This time, we're really lower the bar by putting the PS2, US Extreme, and the 2A DDR cabinet.

571
00:55:23,600 --> 00:55:26,120
Not only that, but we've also changed the pads.

572
00:55:26,120 --> 00:55:30,360
They're now Cobalt Flux wannabes, included with sheet metal on metal contact, but with

573
00:55:30,360 --> 00:55:32,180
a springy, cushiony feel to them.

574
00:55:32,180 --> 00:55:33,380
Now the layout.

575
00:55:33,380 --> 00:55:36,900
When you insert a coin, a big ugly number appears at the bottom center of the screen.

576
00:55:36,900 --> 00:55:39,620
The thing looks like it came straight out of Atari.

577
00:55:39,620 --> 00:55:43,580
Now when you insert enough coins for a credit and press start, you go to the main menu of

578
00:55:43,580 --> 00:55:44,580
the game.

579
00:55:44,580 --> 00:55:47,780
You can't select anything though, it just goes straight into game mode.

580
00:55:47,780 --> 00:55:51,580
Here you have the option of selecting single, versus, or double, regardless of how many

581
00:55:51,580 --> 00:55:53,120
credits you put in.

582
00:55:53,120 --> 00:55:57,020
If you go to versus with one credit, you are stuck at the character selection screen until

583
00:55:57,020 --> 00:55:59,740
you put another credit to activate the other side.

584
00:55:59,740 --> 00:56:03,620
Time goes for double, only you can actually go into the song select screen and pick a

585
00:56:03,620 --> 00:56:04,620
song.

586
00:56:04,620 --> 00:56:09,780
However, one of the sides will not be active at all.

587
00:56:09,780 --> 00:56:11,000
On to the gameplay.

588
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:15,760
If you've ever played DDR Extreme US CS or DDR Festival, you know what to expect.

589
00:56:15,760 --> 00:56:18,060
Anyway you pick the song, but what's this?

590
00:56:18,060 --> 00:56:19,340
No mod menu?

591
00:56:19,340 --> 00:56:23,220
That's right, no possible way to get into the modifier menu.

592
00:56:23,220 --> 00:56:25,520
All you can really do is pick your difficulty.

593
00:56:25,520 --> 00:56:29,140
I've noticed though messing around that you can hit the left right select buttons in place

594
00:56:29,140 --> 00:56:34,060
of the left right arrows. So if an L.R. jump freeze is coming up, no problem! Step off

595
00:56:34,060 --> 00:56:38,300
the pad and hit both the buttons at the same time. I've also noticed that if you're holding

596
00:56:38,300 --> 00:56:43,820
a freeze and hit the start button, the freeze drops, even though you're still on the arrow.

597
00:56:43,820 --> 00:56:47,580
Also if you're playing single player, a credit is in the machine, and someone decides to

598
00:56:47,580 --> 00:56:52,800
press the other side's start button during song select, then bam! Instant verses, also

599
00:56:52,800 --> 00:56:57,480
known as the third mix effect. And of course, if you're one song away from your completing

600
00:56:57,480 --> 00:57:02,700
your set and suddenly decide to play non-stop or challenge, no problem. Remember, in Extreme

601
00:57:02,700 --> 00:57:07,300
US Consumer, you can go into non-stop challenge even on your final song. And hey, if you really

602
00:57:07,300 --> 00:57:12,760
want to piss people off, go for the 20-song custom-ony course. With a possible 22 songs

603
00:57:12,760 --> 00:57:17,840
per game, there's no way you can lose. Well, actually, you've already lost if you've put

604
00:57:17,840 --> 00:57:23,540
your money into this piece of shit. That post again coming from window32 at erininjapan.com.

605
00:57:23,540 --> 00:57:25,540
Thank you for letting me plagiarize your post without any information.

606
00:57:25,540 --> 00:57:34,540
So as my theory went, it is pretty much, you know, you have to put in so many credits, and after a while, it will let you use the start button.

607
00:57:34,540 --> 00:57:37,540
That's why you can't get into the mods, because the mods use the start button.

608
00:57:37,540 --> 00:57:45,540
And obviously it's wired for the, you know, select screen and stuff, that's why the left and right work on that.

609
00:57:45,540 --> 00:57:48,540
So yeah, it's just a hack job.

610
00:57:48,540 --> 00:57:50,800
refresh my memory here for a little bit

611
00:57:50,800 --> 00:57:53,840
isn't there some type of disclaimer

612
00:57:53,840 --> 00:57:57,400
when you boot up the art stream u s it says something about

613
00:57:57,400 --> 00:58:01,960
this game is licensed for personal and home use only

614
00:58:01,960 --> 00:58:03,520
uh... any

615
00:58:03,520 --> 00:58:04,560
so come on

616
00:58:04,560 --> 00:58:07,620
every every game has that have a wife the f b i warning

617
00:58:07,620 --> 00:58:08,880
i don't everything

618
00:58:08,880 --> 00:58:10,600
and i don't like it

619
00:58:10,600 --> 00:58:11,800
use within the united

620
00:58:11,800 --> 00:58:13,640
states or whatever

621
00:58:13,640 --> 00:58:14,960
or north america

622
00:58:14,960 --> 00:58:18,160
however that works

623
00:58:18,160 --> 00:58:22,160
I've already sent an email to Konami, and I'm sure other people have too.

624
00:58:22,160 --> 00:58:25,160
Wait a minute. You sent an email to Konami to tell on them?

625
00:58:25,160 --> 00:58:27,160
Did you tell? Are you a tattletale?

626
00:58:27,160 --> 00:58:29,160
I just wanted to see what they'd say.

627
00:58:29,160 --> 00:58:30,160
Did they reply?

628
00:58:30,160 --> 00:58:31,160
Yeah, they did.

629
00:58:31,160 --> 00:58:33,160
They said they were forwarding it to their...

630
00:58:33,160 --> 00:58:34,160
Because I did...

631
00:58:34,160 --> 00:58:40,160
It was to Konami of Hawaii, and they were forwarding it to Konami of America or somewhere.

632
00:58:40,160 --> 00:58:42,160
I don't know, some other Konami division.

633
00:58:42,160 --> 00:58:45,160
Because Konami's got like 50 different divisions and we can't tell.

634
00:58:45,160 --> 00:58:46,160
They're all Konami to us.

635
00:58:46,160 --> 00:58:47,160
Yeah.

636
00:58:47,160 --> 00:58:49,160
Alright, interesting.

637
00:58:49,160 --> 00:58:54,160
This is the same day that I also wrote the email to PETA.

638
00:58:54,160 --> 00:58:57,160
Loki's been a big tattletale this week.

639
00:58:57,160 --> 00:59:00,160
What is that website, savetoby.com?

640
00:59:00,160 --> 00:59:03,160
There's this website where they're threatening to kill a bunny,

641
00:59:03,160 --> 00:59:05,160
and I was joking in Loki's live journal.

642
00:59:05,160 --> 00:59:07,160
I said, ha ha, you should send that to PETA.

643
00:59:07,160 --> 00:59:08,160
I bet they'd have a field day with it.

644
00:59:08,160 --> 00:59:09,160
So he did.

645
00:59:09,160 --> 00:59:13,160
He sent it to them, and they wrote back this huge old email that said,

646
00:59:13,160 --> 00:59:17,460
that said people like to play pranks on the internet and that's just sick I

647
00:59:17,460 --> 00:59:22,160
thought it was funny I hate PETA I so hate them but I just wanted to see that

648
00:59:22,160 --> 00:59:27,680
website get shut down because because he's making lots of money like 15 grand

649
00:59:27,680 --> 00:59:32,480
off of it so far explicit your thoughts on this

650
00:59:32,480 --> 00:59:36,480
Oh, your thoughts on that?

651
00:59:36,480 --> 00:59:40,480
What the fuck?

652
00:59:40,480 --> 00:59:44,480
DDR WTF mix. First we have

653
00:59:44,480 --> 00:59:48,480
the 20% speed up DDR Extreme Plus, and now we have

654
00:59:48,480 --> 00:59:52,480
this type of crap that doesn't even work at all.

655
00:59:52,480 --> 00:59:56,480
But, oh my gods, you can play

656
00:59:56,480 --> 01:00:00,480
Go West in the arcade and everything, and your reign.

657
01:00:00,480 --> 01:00:07,880
own work, so what's the point? If the pads are going to be broken within the next day,

658
01:00:07,880 --> 01:00:09,720
would there be an actual point of playing the game?

659
01:00:09,720 --> 01:00:18,920
Oh, it looks like, actually I'm getting a private message from one of our buddies in

660
01:00:18,920 --> 01:00:23,800
chat and he's actually sending me a link to a picture that shows you can actually get

661
01:00:23,800 --> 01:00:28,120
the modifiers in this crappy game. Let me post this picture, I hope they don't mind,

662
01:00:28,120 --> 01:00:31,780
but I'm gonna post it in our chat room and so you can take a look at that you

663
01:00:31,780 --> 01:00:34,720
actually can access the modifiers in this somehow looks like somebody figured

664
01:00:34,720 --> 01:00:38,400
it out so yeah you know how they did it huh they said they like stomped on a

665
01:00:38,400 --> 01:00:47,480
bunch of the buttons up up down down left right left right maybe no but maybe

666
01:00:47,480 --> 01:00:52,640
they have some video maybe maybe what they're trying to do is just inspire the

667
01:00:52,640 --> 01:00:57,060
they're getting their inspiration from the old mixes of DDR remember back when

668
01:00:57,060 --> 01:01:06,060
They're trying to make a buck off Namco. Honestly, I could take a shit in a box, put it in a DDR cabinet and sell it to Namco and they'd fucking buy it, because they're retarded.

669
01:01:09,060 --> 01:01:13,060
No, left down... Remember when left down right down left was little? LITTLE!

670
01:01:13,060 --> 01:01:25,060
You know, honestly, um, I should, you know, just create some stupid mix right now with stepmania and cellotone. I can make money, because they're gonna buy it. I'll say, it's DDR9 mix.

671
01:01:25,060 --> 01:01:31,060
And wouldn't that be ironic if Konami came after you because somebody tattled on you, just like you tattled on these guys?

672
01:01:31,060 --> 01:01:34,060
Well, obviously they haven't come after these people since they keep making them.

673
01:01:34,060 --> 01:01:36,060
Speaking of selling in StepMania...

674
01:01:36,060 --> 01:01:39,060
Yes, explicit. Speaking of selling in StepMania...

675
01:01:39,060 --> 01:01:50,060
Speaking of that, does anybody remember about some guy in eBay selling an actual bootlegged CD of StepMania and saying DDR complete?

676
01:01:50,060 --> 01:01:56,060
You can sell SetMania. You can. It's in the license agreement. You just can't include songs with it.

677
01:01:56,060 --> 01:02:01,060
Yeah, and one of the songs says Banner.png.

678
01:02:01,060 --> 01:02:07,060
On first, second, third, fourth, fifth, and et cetera, et cetera.

679
01:02:07,060 --> 01:02:12,060
So, what happened with this on eBay? Did something happen, or are we just talking...

680
01:02:12,060 --> 01:02:17,060
Six people bought it. Six people actually bought it. For ten bucks.

681
01:02:17,060 --> 01:02:22,100
the average Joe gamer doesn't know though the average parent trying to find

682
01:02:22,100 --> 01:02:25,740
that sees DDR on Good Morning America and wants to get it for their kids

683
01:02:25,740 --> 01:02:27,220
doesn't know crap about

684
01:02:27,220 --> 01:02:30,460
these people are just preying off the week

685
01:02:30,460 --> 01:02:33,940
okay does not include any of the MP3's

686
01:02:33,940 --> 01:02:37,980
to the way the way everything is organized

687
01:02:37,980 --> 01:02:41,820
in terms of folder wise you get

688
01:02:41,820 --> 01:02:46,020
highs off you in 6th, 7th and 8th mix so you have duplicates of the same song

689
01:02:46,020 --> 01:02:54,020
It's like those 64-in-1 Taiwanese bootlegs that used to be able to get for the NES.

690
01:02:54,020 --> 01:02:57,020
Exactly. Just like those, but much worse.

691
01:02:57,020 --> 01:03:01,020
Where it would have Contra in it eight times, but maybe the player was a different color.

692
01:03:01,020 --> 01:03:04,020
I bought that for my friend for Christmas.

693
01:03:04,020 --> 01:03:14,860
Hehehe, sad. Where the zapper gun looked like a normal gun. And the controller was an old

694
01:03:14,860 --> 01:03:22,920
Nintendo 64 controller that had the analog stick glued in there. And then the other controller

695
01:03:22,920 --> 01:03:33,940
was a Genesis controller that they wired up. It's funny because after Christmas or whatever,

696
01:03:33,940 --> 01:03:37,620
They never came back to their kiosk in the mall, they're gone.

697
01:03:37,620 --> 01:03:42,600
I'm surprised people don't put this show up on eBay.

698
01:03:42,600 --> 01:03:44,740
We'll sue your ass.

699
01:03:44,740 --> 01:03:48,180
No we won't.

700
01:03:48,180 --> 01:03:51,980
Would anybody buy- we should put copies of the show on eBay and see what happens.

701
01:03:51,980 --> 01:03:54,340
I'm gonna buy them.

702
01:03:54,340 --> 01:03:56,620
Anyway.

703
01:03:56,620 --> 01:04:02,240
Of course we're probably violating all sorts of copyright laws by doing that, but hey.

704
01:04:02,240 --> 01:04:06,440
What's going on in the sim scene right now, Loki? Anything going on in the sim scene?

705
01:04:06,440 --> 01:04:09,320
Even though all the sites are down?

706
01:04:09,320 --> 01:04:10,920
Um...

707
01:04:10,920 --> 01:04:14,320
No.

708
01:04:14,320 --> 01:04:18,000
Really, I don't think there's anything going on.

709
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:22,720
I can't confirm that since my computer's broken, but uh...

710
01:04:22,720 --> 01:04:29,720
The last thing I remember from the DDR sim scene was last week with uh...

711
01:04:29,720 --> 01:04:34,720
What was that, Max? Max Vagina, yes.

712
01:04:34,720 --> 01:04:46,720
That's about, that's the creme de la creme of the, uh, sim scene there, so uh, Max Vagina.

713
01:04:46,720 --> 01:04:50,720
Hmm, yeah.

714
01:04:50,720 --> 01:04:52,720
On that note, I think we're going to go to another break.

715
01:04:52,720 --> 01:04:55,720
When we come back, boys and girls, we're going to get into tonight's Match Game!

716
01:04:55,720 --> 01:05:05,720
Yay! And after the match game, we're going to do the cage match and all those other segments you've come to know and love here on Orange Lounge Radio.

717
01:05:05,720 --> 01:05:15,720
So we will be back after this. In this break, hmm, how about we're going to do some Smile DK to start it off, because we haven't played Smile DK in a while.

718
01:05:15,720 --> 01:05:22,720
We'll be back after this.

719
01:05:45,720 --> 01:05:49,720
No more ringing on my phone

720
01:05:49,720 --> 01:05:53,720
No, just by and night I found your letter

721
01:05:53,720 --> 01:05:56,720
Maybe you don't love me anymore

722
01:05:56,720 --> 01:06:00,720
Foolish me, thinking we will last forever

723
01:06:00,720 --> 01:06:03,720
Dancing all alone, singing tambidos

724
01:06:03,720 --> 01:06:07,720
Listening to the music from the radio, oh

725
01:06:07,720 --> 01:06:10,720
Dancing all alone, singing tambidos

726
01:06:10,720 --> 01:06:13,280
We're sending them together with my room

727
01:06:13,280 --> 01:06:17,720
E-O-E-O, E-O-E-O, E-O-E-O

728
01:06:17,720 --> 01:06:21,320
And I feel lonely, I can't handle it, oh

729
01:06:21,320 --> 01:06:24,720
E-O-E-O, E-O-E-O

730
01:06:24,720 --> 01:06:28,720
When I feel lonely, I can only love, oh

731
01:08:54,720 --> 01:08:56,720
Like the time

732
01:08:57,720 --> 01:09:00,720
You're very hard, you look like a young fella

733
01:09:00,720 --> 01:09:03,720
Take me overnight

734
01:09:03,720 --> 01:09:05,720
Boom, boom, boom, boom

735
01:09:05,720 --> 01:09:07,720
Shake it like a bubble

736
01:09:07,720 --> 01:09:09,720
Boom, boom, boom, boom

737
01:09:09,720 --> 01:09:11,720
Back in the water

738
01:09:11,720 --> 01:09:12,720
Boom, boom, boom, boom

739
01:09:12,720 --> 01:09:14,720
Pushing all the buttons

740
01:09:14,720 --> 01:09:16,720
More

741
01:09:16,720 --> 01:09:18,720
Time

742
01:09:18,720 --> 01:09:20,720
Boom, boom, boom, boom

743
01:09:20,720 --> 01:09:21,720
Ay-ay-ay-ay

744
01:09:21,720 --> 01:09:23,720
Boom, boom, boom, boom

745
01:11:23,720 --> 01:11:43,240
Hi Ho, Kermit the Frog here informing you that today's broadcast of Orange Lounge Radio

746
01:11:43,240 --> 01:11:47,400
is brought to you by the letter B, the letter A, and the number 59.

747
01:11:47,400 --> 01:11:53,400
Can you tell me how to get, how to get to Sesame Street?

748
01:12:17,400 --> 01:12:22,160
I actually have a prize for our winner tonight.

749
01:12:22,160 --> 01:12:25,480
Oh, you have a prize? Not with me, but I will send it to them.

750
01:12:25,480 --> 01:12:28,680
I have a Resident Evil 4 music sampler.

751
01:12:28,680 --> 01:12:35,320
Very cool! An actual prize! And I have like an ESPN Sports one too if they want like a whole pack of them.

752
01:12:35,320 --> 01:12:40,000
So tonight you don't get hung up on if you win or you get, you know, your

753
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:43,320
window closed, I suppose, if you're the chat room contestant. You win an

754
01:12:43,320 --> 01:12:47,360
actual prize. Amazing. Also the winner, going to the winner will be the company

755
01:12:47,360 --> 01:13:02,840
UbiSoft. Wow, okay. Alright, that's awesome. I have to see if I, I don't have my match

756
01:13:02,840 --> 01:13:07,880
game theme music anymore and I don't have Loki's computer to leech it from, so I suppose

757
01:13:07,880 --> 01:13:14,640
we'll have to fill in with our listless music tonight. Or I could just cough from the microphone.

758
01:13:14,640 --> 01:13:17,640
That would be a lovely way to do it. Alright.

759
01:13:17,640 --> 01:13:21,640
How about we just play Genocide, and that'll be the uh, match game music.

760
01:13:21,640 --> 01:13:29,640
Alright, we have to get a caller on the Skype line, so we're gonna open this up to the very first person to call us on the Skype line right now!

761
01:13:29,640 --> 01:13:36,640
First person to call us on the Skype line gets to play match game against our unknown contestant in the chat room, currently, because I haven't said who it is yet.

762
01:13:36,640 --> 01:13:43,640
And, we'll get a chance to win a Resident Evil 4 music sampler! Awesome.

763
01:13:43,640 --> 01:13:46,640
How is Resident Evil 4? I haven't really played it yet.

764
01:13:46,640 --> 01:13:47,640
I haven't really played it yet.

765
01:13:47,640 --> 01:13:49,640
I've seen it, and it looks very rad.

766
01:13:49,640 --> 01:13:50,640
It's very good.

767
01:13:50,640 --> 01:13:59,640
It's practically, if you're one of the casual games, it's probably one of the best, or by far the best Resident Evil out there.

768
01:13:59,640 --> 01:14:00,640
Wow.

769
01:14:00,640 --> 01:14:05,640
More dogs jumping through windows than you can ever imagine.

770
01:14:05,640 --> 01:14:13,640
I mean, it's like an actual 3D game rather than just a slight, like a camera view that was in 1, 2, and 3.

771
01:14:13,640 --> 01:14:15,640
You actually get to see everything.

772
01:14:18,640 --> 01:14:20,640
Nobody's calling in right now.

773
01:14:21,640 --> 01:14:23,640
Yeah, what demo bass is?

774
01:14:23,640 --> 01:14:26,640
Well, you know, we got that buffer, so it kind of makes things difficult,

775
01:14:26,640 --> 01:14:28,640
because we have a slight delay between the time I say,

776
01:14:28,640 --> 01:14:31,640
call now, and the time that they actually hear me say, call now.

777
01:14:31,640 --> 01:14:32,640
So...

778
01:14:32,640 --> 01:14:40,600
So, so, well you know what else is interesting is that a lot of our regulars who call in

779
01:14:40,600 --> 01:14:43,840
on the Skypliner are not here tonight, which is kind of weird.

780
01:14:43,840 --> 01:14:45,400
I don't know, what is going on tonight?

781
01:14:45,400 --> 01:14:48,960
What makes tonight so special?

782
01:14:48,960 --> 01:14:49,960
Three day weekend.

783
01:14:49,960 --> 01:14:53,680
Oh, I don't have a three day weekend.

784
01:14:53,680 --> 01:14:54,680
Why do these people get a three day weekend?

785
01:14:54,680 --> 01:14:56,680
Some of us work for a bank.

786
01:14:56,680 --> 01:14:58,680
Guess who doesn't have to work tomorrow?

787
01:14:58,680 --> 01:14:59,680
Me.

788
01:14:59,680 --> 01:15:14,340
Wow, you'd think by giving away a prize we'd have more people calling in.

789
01:15:14,340 --> 01:15:16,500
Fuck the Skype line, just have them do it through this charity.

790
01:15:16,500 --> 01:15:21,060
Well we have people that are in chat going, oh I've played before so I can't play again.

791
01:15:21,060 --> 01:15:23,220
Sure you can play again!

792
01:15:23,220 --> 01:15:25,780
Who cares?

793
01:15:25,780 --> 01:15:28,240
We actually have a prize to give away tonight.

794
01:15:28,240 --> 01:15:34,120
makes everybody eligible anyway all right if nobody calls in the fursuit

795
01:15:34,120 --> 01:15:37,120
because I know we've got a ton of people who are in chat because we have quite a

796
01:15:37,120 --> 01:15:40,680
few people in chat tonight but they just aren't on the skype line because you

797
01:15:40,680 --> 01:15:46,320
know you have to download skype and then you have to set it up and dah dah dah dah dah

798
01:15:46,320 --> 01:16:03,000
I'll just sit here and wait. We'll just sit here for the next two hours and I'll just

799
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:14,800
wait. We can do that. Tick tock, tick tock. Wow. How stupid do we look right now?

800
01:16:14,800 --> 01:16:21,800
I see Paris Hilton's gonna be in a new horror movie coming up and it's called The Wax House.

801
01:16:21,800 --> 01:16:26,800
It looks decent, except Paris Hilton's in it and she doesn't get naked probably.

802
01:16:26,800 --> 01:16:31,800
I have something to add to that that you could probably make fun of.

803
01:16:31,800 --> 01:16:36,800
I heard her sidekick got hacked. Her T-Mobile sidekick got hacked.

804
01:16:36,800 --> 01:16:38,800
How does that work?

805
01:16:38,800 --> 01:16:43,620
We will um be doing Paris Hilton chat until somebody calls in the skype line

806
01:16:43,620 --> 01:16:46,920
So I suggest let me start downloading it fucking car already

807
01:16:47,920 --> 01:16:53,360
She did off Skype in if I know wait. No, I can't make fears down. Oh

808
01:16:54,060 --> 01:16:56,380
My god, you guys did you see the simple life this week?

809
01:16:56,380 --> 01:17:00,780
Oh my god was so funny you guys Paris Hilton was so funny on the simple life this week

810
01:17:00,940 --> 01:17:06,140
You know when she said, you know that one part when she said that's hot. I was so hot. Oh my god

811
01:17:06,140 --> 01:17:10,760
I love the civil life working at a more guy here, and you know and with her in the dead bodies

812
01:17:10,760 --> 01:17:16,140
And that was so creepy like oh my God, and then you totally needed to have a makeover

813
01:17:16,140 --> 01:17:20,740
She's like so my idol like I just want to be her one these days

814
01:17:20,740 --> 01:17:25,000
I wish I could be so rich and have all those clothes and the shoes. Oh my God

815
01:17:25,000 --> 01:17:42,000
Oh my god, did you see that episode where they were at the airport and they had to be

816
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:46,000
the airport people and they were like waving and it was like they were dancing and they

817
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:49,720
were just playing around and then they had to empty the poo out of the plane as punishment.

818
01:17:49,720 --> 01:17:51,520
It was so funny.

819
01:17:51,520 --> 01:17:53,960
And Paris Hilton was so funny.

820
01:17:53,960 --> 01:17:59,760
then the poo fell on them and then she's like wow I haven't done this since last

821
01:17:59,760 --> 01:18:07,600
year usually they pay extra the shit on me

822
01:18:12,040 --> 01:18:17,200

01:18:17,200 --> 01:18:21,680

Now the skype line is lighting up with calls. I've got like four people hammering in all at once now.

829
01:18:58,800 --> 01:19:04,800
You ever hear that saying, you snooze, you lose? Well, apply it.

830
01:19:04,800 --> 01:19:13,800
You automatically win my eternal gratefulness. You have my gratitude forever.

And the ferret loves you too.

832
01:19:16,800 --> 01:19:18,800
And I love the ferrets too, thank you.

833
01:19:22,800 --> 01:19:25,800
Okay, finally. You wanna know who you're playing against tonight, Ziggy?

834
01:19:26,800 --> 01:19:27,800
Uh, go ahead.

835
01:19:27,800 --> 01:19:31,800
Now you're playing for Resident Evil 4 sampler CD. Isn't that exciting?

836
01:19:32,800 --> 01:19:34,800
Uh, even though I don't play Silent Hill 4.

837
01:19:34,800 --> 01:19:36,800
Well, it's Resident Evil 4, so that's alright.

838
01:19:37,800 --> 01:19:38,800
Resident Evil 4!

839
01:19:38,800 --> 01:19:41,800
There's no way in hell I'm ever getting rid of my Silent Hill 4 sampler.

840
01:19:41,800 --> 01:19:42,800
I'm a kid!

841
01:19:43,800 --> 01:19:45,800
Oh, whatever.

842
01:19:45,800 --> 01:19:49,780
Think you just lost right there. I think I am lost

843
01:19:51,360 --> 01:19:53,360
All right

844
01:19:55,400 --> 01:19:59,680
All right, you're gonna play against MPQ in our chat room tonight

845
01:20:00,600 --> 01:20:06,000
All right, MPQ is gonna bring it. He was the guy who got our trivia question, right? Wait, hold on. Hold on, huh?

846
01:20:06,800 --> 01:20:08,800
Okay, I feel better. All right

847
01:20:09,040 --> 01:20:11,040
let's uh

848
01:20:11,040 --> 01:20:16,040
Let's get into tonight's match game. You know how the match game works, right?

849
01:20:16,040 --> 01:20:17,040
Yeah.

850
01:20:17,040 --> 01:20:21,040
Alright, we're going to ask you a question, and it has a blank in it.

851
01:20:21,040 --> 01:20:25,040
And then your job is to fill in the blank, and for every celebrity in the chatroom,

852
01:20:25,040 --> 01:20:28,040
or I'm sorry, every celebrity in the studio that you match, you get a point.

853
01:20:28,040 --> 01:20:32,040
But here's the thing, I'm going to be asking for an answer from MPQ as well.

854
01:20:32,040 --> 01:20:35,040
And for every answer that he matches, he gets a point.

855
01:20:35,040 --> 01:20:38,040
And he might walk away with that Resident Evil 4 sampler.

856
01:20:38,040 --> 01:20:44,040
So, don't let him do that, or you'll never understand the difference between Resident Evil and Silent Hill.

857
01:20:44,040 --> 01:20:45,040
Alright?

858
01:20:48,040 --> 01:20:50,040
Okay, repeat after me, Siggy.

859
01:20:50,040 --> 01:20:51,040
Resident Evil.

860
01:20:51,040 --> 01:20:53,040
Resident Evil, yeah, I got everything.

861
01:20:53,040 --> 01:20:54,040
Capcom.

862
01:20:54,040 --> 01:20:55,040
Yeah, I know.

863
01:20:55,040 --> 01:20:56,040
Silent Hill.

864
01:20:56,040 --> 01:20:57,040
Konami.

865
01:20:57,040 --> 01:20:58,040
Konami, there you go.

866
01:20:58,040 --> 01:20:59,040
I know, I know.

867
01:20:59,040 --> 01:21:00,040
Good.

868
01:21:00,040 --> 01:21:02,040
Yo, yo, turn down the Nitrous Oxide.

869
01:21:02,040 --> 01:21:05,040
Maybe we should send them a box of notebooks too.

870
01:21:05,040 --> 01:21:06,040
Wait, what?

871
01:21:06,040 --> 01:21:07,040
Maybe we should send them an Enterprise.

872
01:21:07,040 --> 01:21:09,040
Maybe. We'll see. We'll see if he's worthy.

873
01:21:09,040 --> 01:21:10,040
He sends you a rawhide bone.

874
01:21:10,040 --> 01:21:11,040
Let's see how he does.

875
01:21:11,040 --> 01:21:14,040
All right, here we go. First question. You guys ready?

876
01:21:14,040 --> 01:21:16,040
All right, here it is.

877
01:21:16,040 --> 01:21:22,040
Rob, hey, that's me, was all excited to start a brand new blogger this week

878
01:21:22,040 --> 01:21:25,040
all about his video game addictions.

879
01:21:25,040 --> 01:21:28,040
The staff and regulars of Orange Lounge Radio, though, were shocked

880
01:21:28,040 --> 01:21:33,040
when they visited the blog to find that the first entry wasn't about games at all,

881
01:21:33,040 --> 01:21:35,040
but about blank.

882
01:21:35,040 --> 01:21:39,040
OK, don't answer just yet, Siggy. We're going to let the celebrities have a chance to answer.

883
01:21:42,040 --> 01:21:51,040
Orange Lounge Radio staff was surprised to visit the blogger to find that it wasn't about video games at all, but the first entry was all about blank.

884
01:21:57,040 --> 01:21:58,040
Everybody's writing down.

885
01:21:58,040 --> 01:22:14,040
Okay, MPQ's locked in an answer.

886
01:22:14,040 --> 01:22:15,040
Jamie's dinged in.

887
01:22:15,040 --> 01:22:23,040
Magic came to heaven, love has got me breathing, love has got me breathing.

888
01:22:23,040 --> 01:22:27,040
Tell me what the feeling is, come on let's hear it.

889
01:22:27,040 --> 01:22:34,040
I got it!

890
01:22:35,420 --> 01:22:36,660
Alright.

891
01:22:36,660 --> 01:22:40,640
How you doing, Explicit? Got an answer?

892
01:22:40,640 --> 01:22:43,720
Staff and regulars of Warren's Lounge though were shocked when they visited the blog to find that the

893
01:22:43,720 --> 01:22:48,520
first entry wasn't about games at all but about blank.

894
01:22:48,520 --> 01:22:49,800
Angel, you got one?

895
01:22:49,800 --> 01:22:51,800
Still thinking. Angel's still thinking.

896
01:22:58,800 --> 01:22:59,800
Alright.

897
01:23:05,800 --> 01:23:07,800
Just the first thing that comes to your mind, Angel.

898
01:23:09,800 --> 01:23:13,800
Rob was all excited to start a brand new blogger this week all about his video game addictions.

899
01:23:13,800 --> 01:23:17,280
the staff and regulars of Orange Launch Radio though were shocked when they

900
01:23:17,280 --> 01:23:20,480
visited the blog to find that the first entry wasn't about games at all but

901
01:23:20,480 --> 01:23:30,160
about blank. Okay okay it looks like she's written something down explicit

902
01:23:30,160 --> 01:23:37,840
you good to go to? That it is it just go with your gut instinct all right all

903
01:23:37,840 --> 01:23:42,240
right Siggy here we go your answer please the staff and regulars of Orange

904
01:23:42,240 --> 01:23:44,240
Random Prawn!

905
01:24:12,240 --> 01:24:14,680
Boobies is not a match with Ham or Random Prawn.

906
01:24:14,680 --> 01:24:15,960
Explicit.

907
01:24:15,960 --> 01:24:17,000
Gay porn.

908
01:24:17,000 --> 01:24:21,640
Gay porn, I do believe that would be a match with Siggy.

909
01:24:21,640 --> 01:24:25,520
So one point for Siggy, zero for MPQ.

910
01:24:25,520 --> 01:24:26,600
Loki.

911
01:24:26,600 --> 01:24:29,360
Shocked to find it was all about Paris Hilton

912
01:24:29,360 --> 01:24:31,000
in her wonderful shoes.

913
01:24:31,000 --> 01:24:33,680
Paris Hilton.

914
01:24:33,680 --> 01:24:34,960
Not a match.

915
01:24:34,960 --> 01:24:35,960
Sorry.

916
01:24:35,960 --> 01:24:37,680
Angel.

917
01:24:37,680 --> 01:24:40,560
You're going to give me a look from the mouth.

918
01:24:40,560 --> 01:24:44,000
I said Kylie. All about Kylie.

919
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:48,280
Very good answer but not a match, sorry. My answer was

920
01:24:48,280 --> 01:24:51,720
it was all about how he needed a date.

921
01:24:51,720 --> 01:24:55,000
This is the part where you feel pity.

922
01:24:55,000 --> 01:24:58,520
Thank you. Okay. Alright, thank you. Alright! That's enough.

923
01:24:58,520 --> 01:25:02,000
Alright. Alright, so Siggy's up by a point.

924
01:25:02,000 --> 01:25:06,480
Here we go. Question number two. It's MPQ's chance to catch up here.

925
01:25:06,480 --> 01:25:09,680
Loki was very sad. Oh,

926
01:25:09,680 --> 01:25:13,240
Where's my music? Where's my music? Thank you.

927
01:25:13,240 --> 01:25:16,440
Loki was very sad that his computer broke down.

928
01:25:16,440 --> 01:25:20,080
It seemed like the power supply just didn't want to cooperate anymore.

929
01:25:20,080 --> 01:25:25,000
He tried to fix it himself but couldn't, so he had his friend look at the PC

930
01:25:25,000 --> 01:25:28,200
who explained moments after opening it that,

931
01:25:28,200 --> 01:25:33,240
well, Loki, maybe it wouldn't have broken down so fast if you hadn't downloaded so much

932
01:25:33,240 --> 01:25:33,960
blank.

933
01:25:33,960 --> 01:25:53,040
Well, Loki, maybe it wouldn't have broke if you hadn't downloaded so much blank.

934
01:25:53,040 --> 01:25:54,360
Very funny, illusion.

935
01:25:54,360 --> 01:25:55,360
Very funny.

936
01:25:55,360 --> 01:25:58,920
I see our chat room there, huh?

937
01:25:58,920 --> 01:25:59,920
Yeah.

938
01:25:59,920 --> 01:26:05,920
Hey, laughter is my life, you know.

939
01:26:05,920 --> 01:26:14,920
Isn't this great? When you call in the skype line to the show, the chat room feels the need to make fun of you, as well as the rest of us here in the studio.

940
01:26:14,920 --> 01:26:17,920
Beautiful.

941
01:26:17,920 --> 01:26:23,920
One more time, I'll read this for the folks still thinking.

942
01:26:23,920 --> 01:26:27,920
Well, Loki was very sad that his computer broke down.

943
01:26:27,920 --> 01:26:31,920
It seemed like the power supply just didn't want to cooperate anymore.

944
01:26:31,920 --> 01:26:33,920
He tried to fix it himself, but couldn't.

945
01:26:33,920 --> 01:26:37,920
So he had his friend look at the PC who explained moments after opening it that,

946
01:26:37,920 --> 01:26:43,920
Well, Loki, maybe it wouldn't have broken down so fast if you hadn't downloaded so much blank.

947
01:26:43,920 --> 01:26:46,920
All right.

948
01:26:46,920 --> 01:26:49,920
I'm still waiting on the answer from MPQ as well.

949
01:26:49,920 --> 01:26:51,920
Oh no, there it is.

950
01:26:55,920 --> 01:26:57,920
Alright.

951
01:27:00,920 --> 01:27:02,920
How you guys doing? We ready?

952
01:27:02,920 --> 01:27:04,920
Looks like Angel's ready.

953
01:27:04,920 --> 01:27:06,920
Alright, everybody else is ready. And I think...

954
01:27:06,920 --> 01:27:08,920
Alright, we got MPQ's answer too.

955
01:27:08,920 --> 01:27:10,920
Alright, here we go.

956
01:27:10,920 --> 01:27:13,920
This time we'll go with MPQ first.

957
01:27:13,920 --> 01:27:18,920
MPQ says, well Loki, maybe it wouldn't have broken down so fast if you hadn't downloaded so much...

958
01:27:18,920 --> 01:27:23,220
Porn! Porn. Going for the obvious one there. Alright, Siggy.

959
01:27:23,220 --> 01:27:26,640
It wouldn't have broken down so fast if you hadn't downloaded so much.

960
01:27:26,640 --> 01:27:30,920
StepMania Sim Files. StepMania Sim Files.

961
01:27:30,920 --> 01:27:34,080
Oh, good answer. Good answer. Let's see. Jamie,

962
01:27:34,080 --> 01:27:38,640
wouldn't have broken so fast if you hadn't downloaded so much. Actually, I have to make this grammatically

963
01:27:38,640 --> 01:27:39,200
correct.

964
01:27:39,200 --> 01:27:42,600
So many. Final Fantasy XI porn patches.

965
01:27:42,600 --> 01:27:47,400
Final Fantasy XI porn patches. I don't know, is that a point for MPQ?

966
01:27:47,400 --> 01:27:51,220
Half a point. Half a point for MPQ! Yeah, look at that, there's so many of those online.

967
01:27:51,220 --> 01:27:55,500
Half a point for MPQ. Alright. So half, half a point to one point.

968
01:27:55,500 --> 01:27:59,240
Explicit! It would have broken down so fast if you hadn't download so much...

969
01:27:59,240 --> 01:28:02,280
So much hacking shit. So much hacking shit!

970
01:28:02,280 --> 01:28:07,120
Not a match, sorry guys. Loukey! It would have broken down so fast if you wouldn't have downloaded so much...

971
01:28:07,120 --> 01:28:10,580
Dust, because there's so much fucking dust in that case.

972
01:28:10,580 --> 01:28:13,720
Dust! If you hadn't downloaded so much dust!

973
01:28:13,720 --> 01:28:17,720
That's the only way I can figure it out, man. That case is dirty.

974
01:28:17,720 --> 01:28:21,720
All right, Angel. It wouldn't have broken so fast if you hadn't downloaded so many...

975
01:28:21,720 --> 01:28:23,720
Remixes of girls.

976
01:28:23,720 --> 01:28:25,720
Remixes of girls.

977
01:28:25,720 --> 01:28:26,720
Good answer.

978
01:28:26,720 --> 01:28:28,720
Good answer. Not a match.

979
01:28:28,720 --> 01:28:34,720
And I said, it wouldn't have broken so fast if you hadn't downloaded so many crappy remixes of Max 300.

980
01:28:34,720 --> 01:28:42,600
Now, now, Max Vagina has its special place in everyone's heart.

981
01:28:42,600 --> 01:28:51,040
All right, MPQ has half a point, Siggy has one point. It all comes down to this question.

982
01:28:51,040 --> 01:28:56,960
One point for MPQ could win it if Siggy doesn't get any. So we will see. And it's good he

983
01:28:56,960 --> 01:28:59,800
got half a point because this way we're not going to have a tie unless we get a half a

984
01:28:59,800 --> 01:29:04,000
point on this next one. But we'll see. And we've had a question about me, a question

985
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:08,000
about Loki, so you know who this next one's about.

986
01:29:08,000 --> 01:29:09,320
Sure me.

987
01:29:09,320 --> 01:29:13,040
Dark Sakura decided that she was going to head out to RVGL

988
01:29:13,040 --> 01:29:14,960
to play some DER.

989
01:29:14,960 --> 01:29:17,440
Unfortunately, the pads were broken.

990
01:29:17,440 --> 01:29:19,920
And even more unfortunately for the parents and children

991
01:29:19,920 --> 01:29:23,000
present, they were shocked to hear Dark Sakura call

992
01:29:23,000 --> 01:29:24,880
the RVGL pads a blank.

993
01:29:30,400 --> 01:29:33,720
They were shocked to hear Dark Sakura call the Roseville Golf

994
01:29:33,720 --> 01:29:35,720
What's the plan, Pads? A blank.

995
01:29:38,520 --> 01:29:42,520
You can play with the grammar on that one a little bit if you need to. We'll make this a little harder. You can play with the grammar.

996
01:29:43,560 --> 01:29:46,560
So, she called the RVGL Pads blank, or she called them a blank.

997
01:29:52,120 --> 01:29:53,120
Alright.

998
01:29:53,120 --> 01:30:03,240
You know, if we go this year, we need to go see if the price is right.

999
01:30:03,240 --> 01:30:05,240
I know, I know.

1000
01:30:05,240 --> 01:30:12,000
He isn't going to be living much longer, I mean, that hair can't turn much whiter.

1001
01:30:12,000 --> 01:30:20,320
It's going to be transparent soon.

1002
01:30:20,320 --> 01:30:31,240
They were shocked to hear DarkSakura call the RVGL pads a blank.

1003
01:30:50,320 --> 01:30:59,480
Nothing, I'm just laughing at one of the answers.

1004
01:30:59,480 --> 01:31:03,120
Alright, everybody ready in the studio?

1005
01:31:03,120 --> 01:31:04,120
Yes?

1006
01:31:04,120 --> 01:31:07,840
Alright, here we go.

1007
01:31:07,840 --> 01:31:08,840
This is the last question.

1008
01:31:08,840 --> 01:31:12,180
This is going to determine who walks away with a Resident Evil 4 music sampler.

1009
01:31:12,180 --> 01:31:16,000
Dark Sakura decided that she was going to head out to RVGL and play some DDR.

1010
01:31:16,000 --> 01:31:19,320
Unfortunately, the paths were broken and even more unfortunately, for the parents and children

1011
01:31:19,320 --> 01:31:23,400
present, they were shocked to hear Dark Sakura call the RVGL pads A, Siggy?

1012
01:31:23,400 --> 01:31:29,280
Piece of shit pad. Piece of shit pad. Not a piece of shit car, but a piece of shit

1013
01:31:29,280 --> 01:31:35,840
pad. MPQ's answer says, was shocked to hear Dark Sakura call the

1014
01:31:35,840 --> 01:31:43,040
Roseville Golf Land pads A, and I quote, fucking fuck shit fucker. So we will see,

1015
01:31:43,040 --> 01:31:48,080
piece of shit pad and fucking fuck shit fucker. Dark Sakura, your

1016
01:31:48,080 --> 01:31:49,080
Your answer, please.

1017
01:31:49,080 --> 01:31:51,880
The metallic equivalent of fetid, regurgitated dog shit.

1018
01:31:51,880 --> 01:31:52,880
Wow.

1019
01:31:52,880 --> 01:32:01,260
Because they were all too stupid to know what fetid means.

1020
01:32:01,260 --> 01:32:02,260
Not a match.

1021
01:32:02,260 --> 01:32:04,460
Explicit, your answer.

1022
01:32:04,460 --> 01:32:06,100
A motherfucking bitch.

1023
01:32:06,100 --> 01:32:08,360
A motherfucking bitch.

1024
01:32:08,360 --> 01:32:11,720
It's kind of close, but I'm not going to count it as a match.

1025
01:32:11,720 --> 01:32:12,720
Sorry.

1026
01:32:12,720 --> 01:32:13,720
Loki.

1027
01:32:13,720 --> 01:32:15,080
Called them a?

1028
01:32:15,080 --> 01:32:16,400
The lose.

1029
01:32:16,400 --> 01:32:17,960
The lose.

1030
01:32:17,960 --> 01:32:19,960
They are talloos.

1031
01:32:19,960 --> 01:32:20,960
Alright.

1032
01:32:20,960 --> 01:32:21,960
Angel, call the pads A.

1033
01:32:21,960 --> 01:32:25,760
Let's just say she dropped the C-bomb.

1034
01:32:25,760 --> 01:32:27,760
She dropped the C-bomb.

1035
01:32:27,760 --> 01:32:28,760
But I don't.

1036
01:32:28,760 --> 01:32:30,800
Rhymes with punt or shunt.

1037
01:32:30,800 --> 01:32:32,720
I couldn't think of anything else.

1038
01:32:32,720 --> 01:32:43,760
To quote Bette Midler, it starts with a C. It ends with a T and it spells cunt.

1039
01:32:43,760 --> 01:32:45,000
Now that would have been a good answer.

1040
01:32:45,000 --> 01:32:47,000
That's a direct quote.

1041
01:32:47,000 --> 01:32:50,200
Here it is. It all comes down to this.

1042
01:32:50,200 --> 01:32:54,720
If MPQ matches me on this one, he's walking away with a CD.

1043
01:32:54,720 --> 01:32:57,720
If nobody matches me or Siggy matches it,

1044
01:32:57,720 --> 01:33:02,360
Siggy's walking away with that CD. They were shocked to hear Dark Sakura called

1045
01:33:02,360 --> 01:33:03,800
the Roseville Golf Land pads

1046
01:33:03,800 --> 01:33:09,520
a sorrier time than staying at home watching the Paris Hilton porn,

1047
01:33:09,520 --> 01:33:14,160
making Siggy our winner by a half-point.

1048
01:33:14,160 --> 01:33:21,760
So if you want the CD, send me an email, or actually PM me your address and I will mail it to you.

1049
01:33:21,760 --> 01:33:27,760
No, no. Watching the Paris Hilton video is not that sorry of a time. It is rather entertaining.

1050
01:33:27,760 --> 01:33:32,960
So Siggy, you're our winner, and you're going to win that Resident Evil 4 sampler, and you know what?

1051
01:33:32,960 --> 01:33:37,760
I'm actually kind of glad you won it, because now you'll be able to tell the difference between Resident Evil and Silent Hill.

1052
01:33:37,760 --> 01:33:46,760
So, thanks for playing! Any victory speech you want to give?

1053
01:33:46,760 --> 01:33:49,760
Well, not much, but I got some latest.

1054
01:33:49,760 --> 01:33:52,760
Oh, sure. Oh, some actual news on this show?

1055
01:33:52,760 --> 01:33:53,760
Yup.

1056
01:33:53,760 --> 01:33:55,760
The hell? Alright, what's up? What's up, Ziggy?

1057
01:33:55,760 --> 01:34:04,760
Meet me at GDX9 Style CS. It has been confirmed that number 13 by Taka, respect for JSB, is going to be included on the song list.

1058
01:34:04,760 --> 01:34:07,760
That song is, that song is, like, frickin' hard, too.

1059
01:34:07,760 --> 01:34:08,760
Yeah.

1060
01:34:08,760 --> 01:34:09,760
Ooh.

1061
01:34:09,760 --> 01:34:10,760
Interesting.

1062
01:34:10,760 --> 01:34:11,760
How about, uh, 2DX Red?

1063
01:34:11,760 --> 01:34:12,760
Any, um...

1064
01:34:12,760 --> 01:34:15,760
Well, nothing much on 2DX Red.

1065
01:34:15,760 --> 01:34:16,760
Hmm.

1066
01:34:16,760 --> 01:34:20,760
Well, I'd like to see, cause if there were some Red unlocks in 8 style, then maybe they'd

1067
01:34:20,760 --> 01:34:21,760
be nice enough to put something...

1068
01:34:21,760 --> 01:34:24,760
The last unlocked one was for the, uh, Scorpion Fire.

1069
01:34:24,760 --> 01:34:25,760
Oh, okay.

1070
01:34:25,760 --> 01:34:26,760
Well.

1071
01:34:26,760 --> 01:34:31,360
All right, well, how about, do we know anything else about consumer tracks for 9 style yet?

1072
01:34:31,360 --> 01:34:32,760
Cause that's what I'm curious about.

1073
01:34:32,760 --> 01:34:35,260
Well, that's the only one confirmed, number 13.

1074
01:34:35,260 --> 01:34:38,260
Well, that's something. But we've already heard number 13. We know that song.

1075
01:34:38,260 --> 01:34:39,260
Yeah.

1076
01:34:39,260 --> 01:34:42,260
Even if you don't, I will play number 13 in a future break.

1077
01:34:42,260 --> 01:34:48,260
And, just for the record, Siggy, before we let you go, any response to the chatroom?

1078
01:34:48,260 --> 01:34:51,260
They're teasing you on your laugh. Do you have anything you want to say in response to that?

1079
01:34:51,260 --> 01:34:56,260
Well, I don't care what these people say. I just like to laugh the way I want to.

1080
01:34:56,260 --> 01:35:01,260
That's, you preach on. Don't give a crap what our chatroom says. We sure don't, alright?

1081
01:35:01,260 --> 01:35:09,260
Yeah. Oh, by the way, the song A and AA, they're actually pronounced as Ace and Double Ace.

1082
01:35:09,260 --> 01:35:14,260
Ace and Double Ace. Oh, like a deck of cards, Ace and Double Ace. I get it.

1083
01:35:14,260 --> 01:35:21,260
I like A and AA. Screw that. I'm gonna call it A and AA.

1084
01:35:21,260 --> 01:35:24,260
Remember, EDR is the thirteenth step.

1085
01:35:24,260 --> 01:35:27,260
Or A and A.

1086
01:35:27,260 --> 01:35:29,260
Ah!

1087
01:35:29,260 --> 01:35:32,620
Alright, thanks for the call, Siggy. Congratulations on your win.

1088
01:35:32,620 --> 01:35:34,620
Email, you got Jamie's email, right?

1089
01:35:34,620 --> 01:35:37,620
Yeah, yeah, I'll just send a private message.

1090
01:35:37,620 --> 01:35:39,620
Okay, he'll send a private message.

1091
01:35:39,620 --> 01:35:40,620
Yeah, I'm in the chatroom right now.

1092
01:35:40,620 --> 01:35:41,620
Alright. Sounds good!

1093
01:35:41,620 --> 01:35:42,620
Alright.

1094
01:35:42,620 --> 01:35:43,620
Congratulations, man.

1095
01:35:43,620 --> 01:35:44,620
Thank you, Sky!

1096
01:35:44,620 --> 01:35:46,620
No problem, good job. Bye.

1097
01:35:46,620 --> 01:35:50,620
Actually, to be accurate, according to Dennis, Larry Nyquil is the thirteenth step.

1098
01:35:50,620 --> 01:35:55,620
When I hear the word ace, I can't help but think of...

1099
01:35:55,620 --> 01:36:01,620
of, um, what was that, Wild Zero? Or whatever?

1100
01:36:01,620 --> 01:36:02,620
What?

1101
01:36:02,620 --> 01:36:08,620
Or, not Wild Zero, um, that stupid zombie movie. Remember?

1102
01:36:08,620 --> 01:36:10,620
I have no idea what you're talking about right now.

1103
01:36:10,620 --> 01:36:11,620
That was Wild Zero.

1104
01:36:11,620 --> 01:36:12,620
Yeah, it was Wild Zero.

1105
01:36:12,620 --> 01:36:14,620
I got you the soundtrack, the record for that.

1106
01:36:14,620 --> 01:36:15,620
Ace!

1107
01:36:15,620 --> 01:36:17,620
I do remember that, I have that still.

1108
01:36:17,620 --> 01:36:19,620
Who was that, Guitar Wolf?

1109
01:36:19,620 --> 01:36:20,620
Guitar Wolf, that was it.

1110
01:36:20,620 --> 01:36:22,620
Ace!

1111
01:36:22,620 --> 01:36:25,620
Okay, I'm lost. That's alright.

1112
01:36:25,620 --> 01:36:30,620
Every time I hear Ace, I start thinking of this line from Red Dwarf.

1113
01:36:30,620 --> 01:36:33,620
Your nickname was never Ace, maybe Acehole.

1114
01:36:33,620 --> 01:36:36,620
You're an Acehole.

1115
01:36:36,620 --> 01:36:44,620
I don't know if anybody in here watched a lot of Red Dwarf, but Remor always called himself Ace.

1116
01:36:44,620 --> 01:36:48,620
Finally, Lister told him off and said that his nickname was Acehole.

1117
01:36:48,620 --> 01:37:01,620
Alright. Um, we're gonna go to break, and in this break we're gonna hear, I just, I will play some number 13, and we'll play some Ace as well, or as I like to say it, Ahh! Ahh!

1118
01:37:01,620 --> 01:37:12,620
So we'll play that, and then we're gonna do the, um, cage match when we come back, and, uh, I, I do wanna talk about one non-Baumani piece of video game news, even though it's not the podcast,

1119
01:37:12,620 --> 01:37:17,340
There's just something that went in the news this week that is just too damn

1120
01:37:17,340 --> 01:37:21,820
funny for us not to pass up. And especially with this many of us that

1121
01:37:21,820 --> 01:37:25,880
play MMORPGs. So you know we're gonna talk about this. I'll teach you with that.

1122
01:37:25,880 --> 01:37:31,040
We'll be back after this with more Orange Launch Radio.

1123
01:38:25,880 --> 01:38:27,880
I hope you enjoyed this video.

1124
01:38:27,880 --> 01:38:29,880

1125
01:39:29,880 --> 01:39:31,880
You

1126
01:43:29,880 --> 01:43:59,800
We are back here on Orange Lawn's radio, and Jamie's spreading the inside joke love.

1127
01:43:59,800 --> 01:44:07,040
here in the studio this is an old joke from under sedation live I know you know

1128
01:44:07,040 --> 01:44:10,520
wasn't that reunion show supposed to happen like soon it's this eventually

1129
01:44:10,520 --> 01:44:16,480
okay but um this was back when mint skittles came out right and Travis was

1130
01:44:16,480 --> 01:44:22,200
joking about the making mint scattles to make your but be minty fresh yes okay

1131
01:44:22,200 --> 01:44:26,120
and I made a label you actually made the label and photo or paint shop pro I'm

1132
01:44:26,120 --> 01:44:28,920
sorry I forgot you're not a Photoshop girl I have to use Photoshop and I hate

1133
01:44:28,920 --> 01:44:34,160
it okay anyway we are back here on orange we are gonna get into the cage

1134
01:44:34,160 --> 01:44:37,280
match rather shortly but I had to talk about this story that came up because

1135
01:44:37,280 --> 01:44:41,240
it's just too dang good and it's actually something that was posted to

1136
01:44:41,240 --> 01:44:44,480
our website earlier this week so if you stay on top of our website you've

1137
01:44:44,480 --> 01:44:53,240
already read this but if you don't we're gonna read it again basically it has to

1138
01:44:53,240 --> 01:44:57,320
do with ever quest to now I know that that's an MMORPG that none of us play

1139
01:44:57,320 --> 01:45:02,000
We're mostly Final Fantasy XI addicts. Maybe, maybe some of us have dabbled in

1140
01:45:02,000 --> 01:45:05,600
the World of Warcraft. I know Jamie was big on Ragnarok. I was too for a little

1141
01:45:05,600 --> 01:45:09,400
while. So some various ones. EverQuest isn't one we've really touched, but it is

1142
01:45:09,400 --> 01:45:12,560
a big one. It's a big one. I know people are really into EverQuest. Well, they're

1143
01:45:12,560 --> 01:45:17,660
gonna add a new command line feature into EverQuest 2. You know how you can

1144
01:45:17,660 --> 01:45:23,560
slash say, slash, you know, fight. You type in the little command slash whatever. Well

1145
01:45:23,560 --> 01:45:29,860
they're putting a new one into EverQuest 2. It's called slash pizza and if you type

1146
01:45:29,860 --> 01:45:34,980
slash pizza it'll actually open up a little web browser right on top of your

1147
01:45:34,980 --> 01:45:40,040
EverQuest 2 screen and take it directly to Pizza Hut.com where you can order a

1148
01:45:40,040 --> 01:45:45,420
pizza and have it delivered right to your home so that you can play EverQuest

1149
01:45:45,420 --> 01:45:52,480
all night long. That's fucking sad. This is exactly why I wanted to bring this up

1150
01:45:52,480 --> 01:45:54,480
What the fuck?

1151
01:46:02,480 --> 01:46:03,480
No.

1152
01:46:04,480 --> 01:46:10,480
Because if I'm hungry, I can go into the kitchen and cook some food.

1153
01:46:11,480 --> 01:46:16,480
If I wanted to go out to eat, my ass would log out and go out to eat.

1154
01:46:16,480 --> 01:46:20,480
eat. Because guess what? There's real people out in the world.

1155
01:46:20,480 --> 01:46:24,480
But you've had pizza delivered to you before, right? Maybe once in a while?

1156
01:46:24,480 --> 01:46:28,480
Yeah, but not like because I was too lazy to log my ass off the damn game and go get it.

1157
01:46:28,480 --> 01:46:32,480
Right, you order pizza because, you know, you want...

1158
01:46:32,480 --> 01:46:36,480
I was too lazy to go get away from my movie and go get it.

1159
01:46:36,480 --> 01:46:40,480
Exactly, exactly. The sad thing is, I know people

1160
01:46:40,480 --> 01:46:44,480
that will use, I would probably use this quite a bit if they

1161
01:46:44,480 --> 01:46:49,940
this in Final Fantasy XI, but at the same time, that would probably be the point where

1162
01:46:49,940 --> 01:46:56,440
I'd have to say, oh my god, Rob, look at yourself, should I be happy if we had a Pizza Hut near

1163
01:46:56,440 --> 01:47:03,200
us? That's true, we don't even have a Pizza Hut in town. The pizza place closest to my

1164
01:47:03,200 --> 01:47:08,200
house is actually Round Table. Well, right, so even if they built this in Final Fantasy

1165
01:47:08,200 --> 01:47:11,840
We wouldn't be able to use it if we could only pay for those pizzas in Gil

1166
01:47:14,960 --> 01:47:20,240
That's the next thing we're moving to what if you could pay for the pizza using the online game currency

1167
01:47:20,240 --> 01:47:22,240
How sad would that be?

1168
01:47:22,400 --> 01:47:28,120
Or like if you order the pizza, then your character gets like, you know a vitality up or something

1169
01:47:30,080 --> 01:47:35,360
Maximum hit points have increased because you ordered Pizza Hut. Is this where advertising is going?

1170
01:47:35,360 --> 01:47:40,360
I mean, order Taco Bell and receive Bio Effect.

1171
01:47:46,360 --> 01:47:51,360
No, and if you like, order from Del Taco, you get the Dia one.

1172
01:47:52,360 --> 01:47:55,360
You mean diarrhea? Is that what's okay?

1173
01:47:55,360 --> 01:47:57,360
Alright, order anything ho-

1174
01:48:01,360 --> 01:48:03,360
Order anything hot so as to cast fire.

1175
01:48:04,360 --> 01:48:06,360
Actually, Ferraga, sorry.

1176
01:48:06,360 --> 01:48:10,360
Your ass begins casting fire on Little Goblin.

1177
01:48:12,360 --> 01:48:14,360
Wow, that's amazing.

1178
01:48:18,360 --> 01:48:20,360
What other slash features do you think-

1179
01:48:20,360 --> 01:48:22,360
First slash pizza, what's next?

1180
01:48:22,360 --> 01:48:24,360
Slash blowjob? Get a hooker?

1181
01:48:24,360 --> 01:48:29,360
You get a hooker to come to your house and have sex with you because nobody else will because you play EverQuest all day?

1182
01:48:29,360 --> 01:48:34,360
No, you'd order an in-game prostitute.

1183
01:48:34,360 --> 01:48:42,360
So I would like to just, I would just like to kind of humor that question. What other type of slash features would you like to see in EverQuest?

1184
01:48:42,360 --> 01:48:46,360
Yeah, this might make a good list list later on. We'll have to see.

1185
01:48:46,360 --> 01:48:55,360
I think a good one would be slash exercise, where when you type it in, the game shuts down, and your computer shuts off, and it won't let you turn it on for 50 minutes.

1186
01:48:55,360 --> 01:49:00,360
So you have to go out and exercise.

1187
01:49:00,360 --> 01:49:05,360
Yes, yes, you can see my computer has gone into that feature right now.

1188
01:49:05,360 --> 01:49:11,360
Apparently you typed it in earlier, Loki.

1189
01:49:41,360 --> 01:49:48,360
So that they would make the muscles contract and expand to the point that it gets tired

1190
01:49:48,360 --> 01:49:53,160
out as though you had exercised it, and that's all that that ab thing is.

1191
01:49:53,160 --> 01:49:55,620
So it just makes you feel like you've exercised it?

1192
01:49:55,620 --> 01:49:56,620
Sort of.

1193
01:49:56,620 --> 01:49:59,680
It's just to wear out the muscles to the point it would relax, because for me it was hitting

1194
01:49:59,680 --> 01:50:00,680
the nerve.

1195
01:50:00,680 --> 01:50:01,680
That sounds painful.

1196
01:50:01,680 --> 01:50:02,680
It's not.

1197
01:50:02,680 --> 01:50:03,680
I could never put one of those things on.

1198
01:50:03,680 --> 01:50:04,680
It's light electricity.

1199
01:50:04,680 --> 01:50:12,400
But they also do that for patients who have to keep the muscles from atrophy.

1200
01:50:12,400 --> 01:50:15,720
Isn't that like how Spider-Man became Spider-Man?

1201
01:50:15,720 --> 01:50:18,840
No, you got bit by a damn radioactive spider.

1202
01:50:18,840 --> 01:50:22,240
Well, radioactive spider, radioactive ab belt, same thing.

1203
01:50:22,240 --> 01:50:25,800
It's not radioactive, it's electricity.

1204
01:50:25,800 --> 01:50:28,640
Close enough.

1205
01:50:28,640 --> 01:50:31,480
Alright.

1206
01:50:31,480 --> 01:50:40,480
I guess we'll get into the Orange Lawns Radio Cage Match since all those jokes are dead and gone now.

1207
01:50:40,480 --> 01:50:43,480
I agree with Elmo. There needs to be a slash slash.

1208
01:50:43,480 --> 01:50:54,480
Except they said, for me, what are you implying? That I can't write my own erotic stories offline? Please.

1209
01:50:54,480 --> 01:51:02,880
please. Alright, let's get into tonight's cage match boys and girls. The way the cage

I want you in my bed from far away, I've checked you out

1225
01:52:25,500 --> 01:52:27,000
Can't wait to see me

01:52:31,000 --> 01:52:32,000
I'm on a shake out

1228
01:52:34,000 --> 01:52:35,000
I'm on a shake out

1229
01:52:35,000 --> 01:52:57,120
I've got a plan in mind for you I'm waiting till the time is right

01:53:00,520 --> 01:53:03,520
Watching you from far away, you look so sweet and clueless

1232
01:53:03,520 --> 01:53:06,520
Soon I'll move in on my prey, it's time for me to do this

1233
01:53:20,520 --> 01:53:22,520
Watching and waiting

1234
01:53:23,520 --> 01:53:25,520
The feeling you're feeling

1235
01:53:26,520 --> 01:53:28,520
Live in my time

1236
01:53:28,520 --> 01:53:34,520
Yeah, I know that you're soon to be mine

1237
01:53:37,520 --> 01:53:38,520
Soon to be mine

1238
01:53:41,520 --> 01:53:47,520
Can't let you see me

1239
01:53:47,520 --> 01:53:49,520
I'm on a stakeout

1240
01:53:50,520 --> 01:53:52,520
I'm on a stakeout

1241
01:53:52,520 --> 01:54:03,520
Alright, that's our returning champion, Freezepop, with Stake Out. It is up against two new songs

1242
01:54:03,520 --> 01:54:08,260
this week, starting off with a song that Jamie picked, and it actually looks like one I've

1243
01:54:08,260 --> 01:54:13,800
heard before, but not in this. I don't remember the name of the song, I just picked it. It's

1244
01:54:13,800 --> 01:54:19,560
the filter in Crystal Method, and I don't remember the name of the song. It's called

1245
01:54:19,560 --> 01:54:24,120
can't you trip like I do yes yes and it was actually a popular song several

1246
01:54:24,120 --> 01:54:27,880
years ago but we'll see on soundtrack it was on the spawn soundtrack that's right

1247
01:54:27,880 --> 01:54:30,960
I didn't know that I just like the song that's all right there's hey there's

1248
01:54:30,960 --> 01:54:33,600
nothing hey I put a top boy I put Gwen Stefani in and it ended up getting

1249
01:54:33,600 --> 01:54:35,840
retired there's nothing wrong with putting a popular song in. Who swore they

1250
01:54:35,840 --> 01:54:39,640
picked this song as a cadence like way earlier. No you picked a crystal

1251
01:54:39,640 --> 01:54:43,640
you picked crystal method before but never for this one. Who the hell cares

1252
01:54:43,640 --> 01:54:46,680
anyway we can't remember it it doesn't matter. That's right if we don't remember then it

1253
01:54:46,680 --> 01:54:53,680
Alright, here it is. Song number two, tonight's cage match, Filter and Crystal Method. Can't you trip like I do?

1254
01:55:16,680 --> 01:55:29,680
I got the peace of mind of a killer soul I got the rationale of a New York cop

1255
01:55:29,680 --> 01:55:38,680
I got the patience of a chopping block, yeah Just like I do

1256
01:55:38,680 --> 01:55:40,680
I'm a nerd, I'm a nerd

1257
01:55:41,680 --> 01:55:43,680
Just like I do

1258
01:55:44,680 --> 01:55:45,680
I'm a nerd

1259
01:55:56,680 --> 01:55:59,680
I've got the acumen, I don't know

1260
01:55:59,680 --> 01:56:01,680
But season will grow

1261
01:56:01,680 --> 01:56:04,680
I've got the black or stay

1262
01:56:04,680 --> 01:56:07,680
Of a billion souls

1263
01:56:07,680 --> 01:56:12,980
I got the world down my back, but I don't seem to care

1264
01:56:12,980 --> 01:56:18,680
I got the comprehension of the world, but where, yeah

1265
01:56:18,680 --> 01:56:21,680
Just like I do

1266
01:56:21,680 --> 01:56:24,680
Just like I do

1267
01:56:24,680 --> 01:56:26,680
Just like I do

1268
01:56:29,680 --> 01:56:32,680
Just like I do

1269
01:56:32,680 --> 01:57:00,680
Can't do, can't do, trippin' I do Can't do, can't do, trippin' I do

1270
01:57:00,680 --> 01:57:04,680
Down on my back I can't sleep cause I'm forming

1271
01:57:04,680 --> 01:57:08,680
Eyes in my teeth I can't see cause I'm eating

1272
01:57:08,680 --> 01:57:12,680
Cash for the noise I can't think cause it's crushing

1273
01:57:12,680 --> 01:57:16,680
Back on my feet like a freight train I'm going

1274
01:57:16,680 --> 01:57:24,680
Can everybody feel like I do?

1275
01:57:24,680 --> 01:57:47,680
Can't you, can't you strip back at you Can't you, can't you strip back at you

1276
01:57:54,680 --> 01:58:23,680
Can't fix it, can't fix it, can't you feel it again?

1277
01:58:24,680 --> 01:58:28,680
Can't you walk in two regions just like us?

1278
01:58:28,680 --> 01:58:36,680
Can't you walk in two regions just like us?

1279
01:58:36,680 --> 01:58:52,680
Can't you walk in two regions just like us?

1280
01:59:22,680 --> 01:59:27,960
girls in studio thought of that one that was can't strip like i do can you trip it jamie

1281
01:59:27,960 --> 01:59:35,400
i like that song so it gets a nine explicit i like the drums in the actual song it's a

1282
01:59:35,400 --> 01:59:41,840
pretty good song but i don't know the voice kind of i don't know it's i say 8.5 8.5 low-key

1283
01:59:41,840 --> 01:59:49,920
this song is old i used to play this song um while playing qsar so um it gets the nine

1284
01:59:49,920 --> 01:59:54,920
I like Satan on there, that was my favorite one.

1285
01:59:54,920 --> 01:59:55,920
You would.

1286
01:59:55,920 --> 01:59:56,920
Angel?

1287
01:59:56,920 --> 02:00:01,920
Nine chocolate covered pants, I mean, um, nine.

1288
02:00:01,920 --> 02:00:02,920
Okay.

1289
02:00:02,920 --> 02:00:06,920
And I give it, I know, I know, I give it, um, it's like one of those songs like it starts

1290
02:00:06,920 --> 02:00:10,920
off really really cool and then as it goes on I'm kind of like, alright, time to end.

1291
02:00:10,920 --> 02:00:12,920
But I still like it, it's groovy.

1292
02:00:12,920 --> 02:00:15,920
I give it like a 7.5.

1293
02:00:15,920 --> 02:00:16,920
Alright.

1294
02:00:16,920 --> 02:00:17,920
Loki, your turn.

1295
02:00:17,920 --> 02:00:22,920
Number three tonight is by you. What'd you pick? Well, it's not by you, but you picked it.

1296
02:00:22,920 --> 02:00:36,920
Well, this song, I don't really know how to describe this song. This song is just different. It's one of those things I found on Amazon, searching for free music.

1297
02:00:36,920 --> 02:00:44,080
and it's just catchy I don't know a lot of people aren't gonna like it but you

1298
02:00:44,080 --> 02:00:48,640
know I like I've been listening to my car it's just catchy and apparently it

1299
02:00:48,640 --> 02:00:56,040
it was it's a I guess on the charts over in India because that's you know it's an

1300
02:00:56,040 --> 02:01:02,760
Indian artist that DJ Sishar did the remix of it and from a movie I

1301
02:01:02,760 --> 02:01:06,160
can't remember what the movie is called though I think it's like Tamil or

1302
02:01:06,160 --> 02:01:07,260
something like that

1303
02:01:07,260 --> 02:01:09,560
but uh...

1304
02:01:09,560 --> 02:01:10,840
i don't know

1305
02:01:10,840 --> 02:01:13,880
but yeah it it's a very

1306
02:01:13,880 --> 02:01:15,880
it's an interesting song

1307
02:01:15,880 --> 02:01:20,760
trampy dancy, it's got a little bit of guitar. Can you pronounce this name?

1308
02:01:20,760 --> 02:01:25,120
uh... i think it's pronounced like uh... kekakekka or something. Well that's the artist

1309
02:01:25,120 --> 02:01:29,880
kekakekka. Kekakekka is the artist. It's the Tamils song, it's the name of the actual song.

1310
02:01:29,880 --> 02:01:32,160
It says in the title, it says

1311
02:01:32,160 --> 02:01:37,680
you and i apologize profusely to um... everybody in the movie it's from

1312
02:01:37,680 --> 02:01:38,520
it

1313
02:01:38,520 --> 02:01:42,640
it's the movie that's from union urea union urea looks like you're in your

1314
02:01:42,640 --> 02:01:45,520
except that the movie that's well-paid camel is

1315
02:01:45,520 --> 02:01:48,080
the language i think it's both in it

1316
02:01:48,080 --> 02:01:48,560
it

1317
02:01:48,560 --> 02:01:52,440
uh... it's the title song for that movie that's remix by the state of the

1318
02:01:52,440 --> 02:01:54,320
citizen of the art of the cake

1319
02:01:54,320 --> 02:01:58,900
take a kick there were a pj sitar makes the remixing take a caca

1320
02:01:58,900 --> 02:02:02,000
here it is enjoy

1321
02:02:32,000 --> 02:02:37,000
music

1322
02:02:37,000 --> 02:02:42,000
music

1323
02:02:42,000 --> 02:02:47,000
music

1324
02:02:47,000 --> 02:02:52,000
music

1325
02:02:52,000 --> 02:02:57,000
music

1326
02:07:27,000 --> 02:07:29,000
Three, two, one, back

1327
02:07:57,000 --> 02:08:04,000
all

1328
02:08:08,940 --> 02:08:11,280
right we are back and that was

1329
02:08:11,280 --> 02:08:15,260
kicka kicka DJ sit are three mixin and a song we

1330
02:08:15,260 --> 02:08:18,680
I believe and I apologize again for butchering absolutely butchering the

1331
02:08:18,680 --> 02:08:19,440
pronunciation is

1332
02:08:19,440 --> 02:08:23,900
the urine you re let's see what you guys think

1333
02:08:23,900 --> 02:08:32,440
Jamie Dark Sakura and a half from Dark Sakura explicit that's pretty good but

1334
02:08:32,440 --> 02:08:36,140
some reason I didn't like the beginning too much but once again to the actual

1335
02:08:36,140 --> 02:08:43,660
music yeah 8.5 8.5 from explicit Loki I love the backbeat for that song that was

1336
02:08:43,660 --> 02:08:46,980
one of the things about DJ Siddharth even his other stuff that he has is

1337
02:08:46,980 --> 02:08:51,340
really good beats to all of it why he chose I mean I understand why he chose

1338
02:08:51,340 --> 02:08:59,340
remix that song to be you know an indian dj so i mean it makes sense but um it was i don't know i

1339
02:08:59,340 --> 02:09:04,860
i if i understood the vocals i'm sure it'd make more sense or if i heard the original song it

1340
02:09:04,860 --> 02:09:09,660
makes more sense to me but since i didn't you know i gave it a nine though it's decent but

1341
02:09:09,660 --> 02:09:16,700
it probably's annoying to a lot of people angels i liked it a lot just like uh another

1342
02:09:16,700 --> 02:09:24,260
other Indian artist that I heard, it kind of just reminded me of that. So, I'll be nice.

1343
02:09:24,260 --> 02:09:27,380
I'll give it a nine.

1344
02:09:27,380 --> 02:09:30,460
I actually surprisingly liked that song quite a bit. I just think it needed some of the

1345
02:09:30,460 --> 02:09:34,500
fat trimmed from it, like the beginning was a little slow and there's some parts that

1346
02:09:34,500 --> 02:09:37,220
could have been cut, because that song was over six minutes, well, just about over six

1347
02:09:37,220 --> 02:09:41,620
minutes. And I think it could have been cut down a little bit, a little more compact,

1348
02:09:41,620 --> 02:09:44,900
about four minutes probably would have been good. Otherwise though, I do like the beat.

1349
02:09:44,900 --> 02:09:47,180
I like kind of what they remixed there. That's pretty cool

1350
02:09:47,180 --> 02:09:50,740
I understand though why it has the big beginning because it's probably meant for

1351
02:09:51,420 --> 02:09:53,420
Mixing in to your normal. Yeah

1352
02:09:53,580 --> 02:09:57,600
But as far as you know playing it by itself, it kind of hurts it for that

1353
02:09:57,600 --> 02:09:59,620
So I give it an eight and a half though. It was still a good song

1354
02:09:59,940 --> 02:10:04,020
All right, which is surprising that I liked yet another Loki's caveman song

1355
02:10:04,020 --> 02:10:05,700
You know the one you put in a couple weeks ago

1356
02:10:05,700 --> 02:10:09,820
I've been listening to a ton in my car and I thought the echoing green one

1357
02:10:09,820 --> 02:10:14,260
and I actually downloaded you know what the funny thing about that echo image

1358
02:10:14,260 --> 02:10:18,260
because you said it sounded like them echo image actually remixed that song

1359
02:10:18,260 --> 02:10:21,900
it's available on iTunes I actually used one of my free songs for it but here's

1360
02:10:21,900 --> 02:10:26,220
the thing it sucks it really sucks I was so sad

1361
02:10:26,220 --> 02:10:31,500
like good song good band this is gonna be awesome sucks oh anyway back to the

1362
02:10:31,500 --> 02:10:36,620
issue at hand here let's recap the three songs you can vote for tonight song

1363
02:10:36,620 --> 02:10:46,620
Song number one, last week's winner, Freezepop, Stakeout.

1364
02:10:46,620 --> 02:10:50,360
And song number two you can vote for tonight, Filter and the Crystal Method, Can't You Trip

1365
02:10:50,360 --> 02:10:59,940
Like I Do?

1366
02:10:59,940 --> 02:11:03,100
I had to pick the quietest part of that song by random there, whoops.

1367
02:11:03,100 --> 02:11:07,500
Keka Keka, a remix by DJ Siddharth, is song number three, Urine Urie.

1370
02:11:28,540 --> 02:11:31,540
Send a private message to Sky right now with your vote. Meanwhile,

1371
02:11:31,540 --> 02:11:36,040
you know, I was just thinking this week about song pack number 8

1372
02:11:36,040 --> 02:11:41,140
on the Xbox and... Is that ever gonna come out? I don't know. I'm starting to worry.

1373
02:11:41,140 --> 02:11:44,380
It's still not out. What in the hell is going on?

1374
02:11:44,380 --> 02:11:48,260
Somebody needs to get bitch slapped and I don't think it's Konami. I think it's

1375
02:11:48,260 --> 02:11:49,380
somebody at Microsoft.

1376
02:11:49,380 --> 02:11:52,900
I guess they're too busy concerning themselves with the Xboxes that caught

1377
02:11:52,900 --> 02:11:54,740
on fire or something. I don't know.

1378
02:11:54,740 --> 02:11:58,940
Because you heard about this, right? The Microsoft had to recall

1379
02:11:58,940 --> 02:12:02,420
the power cords for Xboxes that were made

1380
02:12:02,420 --> 02:12:07,380
prior to October 2003 because I guess if you leave it on for a prolonged period

1381
02:12:07,380 --> 02:12:08,140
of time

1382
02:12:08,140 --> 02:12:15,140
it will catch fire. They say it's only a one in ten thousand chance but you know

1383
02:12:15,460 --> 02:12:18,660
those types of lawsuits are still pretty big deal so they gotta recall

1384
02:12:18,660 --> 02:12:22,980
and they'll send you a free power cord. I got an email on it although I believe

1385
02:12:22,980 --> 02:12:30,680
My particular Xbox is immune because it's a Halo Xbox. I got the Halo limited edition. I don't think it affects these.

1386
02:12:30,680 --> 02:12:35,680
I still got an email on it because they suspect it. I don't know. I got to check it out at least.

1387
02:12:35,680 --> 02:12:39,680
Any comments on this? Anything you guys have heard? Extra on this?

1388
02:12:39,680 --> 02:12:43,680
Our first Xbox already died, so it's kind of moot for me.

1389
02:12:43,680 --> 02:12:49,980
That's, yeah, I guess that's what I hear is that the Xboxes don't last too long usually.

1390
02:12:49,980 --> 02:12:54,060
so here's the email I got it says Microsoft has chosen to replace the

1391
02:12:54,060 --> 02:13:00,140
power cords on Xbox console manufactured before October 23rd 2003 our records

1392
02:13:00,140 --> 02:13:03,740
indicate that you may own one of these consoles hey that's me check the

1393
02:13:03,740 --> 02:13:07,180
manufacturer date on the bottom of your console no action is necessary if your

1394
02:13:07,180 --> 02:13:12,420
console is manufactured on or after October 23rd 2003 now I'm all curious

1395
02:13:12,420 --> 02:13:18,420
Loki's gonna look look he's gonna go look at that manufacture date I thought

1396
02:13:18,420 --> 02:13:23,420
I thought I bought mine after that, but I guess that doesn't mean it was manufactured after that day, necessarily.

1397
02:13:23,420 --> 02:13:26,420
We'll see.

1398
02:13:26,420 --> 02:13:30,420
I actually didn't know about that, but okay.

1399
02:13:30,420 --> 02:13:35,420
You know what's sad is that must have actually happened for them to realize it.

1400
02:13:35,420 --> 02:13:37,420
What the hell, April 16th?

1401
02:13:37,420 --> 02:13:42,420
Yep, my Xbox was made April 16th, 2004. I am immune, motherfucker.

1402
02:13:42,420 --> 02:13:45,420
That's the same, that's my birthday.

1403
02:13:45,420 --> 02:13:50,420
Yes. Right on. Yeah, that's the exact date of my birthday. I was like, what the...

1404
02:13:50,420 --> 02:13:54,420
Hey, that's cool. Oh well. Yeah, I haven't had my Xbox that long.

1405
02:13:54,420 --> 02:13:57,420
Because those Halo ones just came out, so.

1406
02:13:57,420 --> 02:14:02,420
I should get a new cord anyway, just because they're really expensive otherwise.

1407
02:14:02,420 --> 02:14:05,420
Oh yeah, just get it for free, since they're...

1408
02:14:07,420 --> 02:14:11,420
You know, fixing the problem, according to what they're saying.

1409
02:14:11,420 --> 02:14:14,420
When did this happen though? I didn't hear about this.

1410
02:14:14,420 --> 02:14:20,420
It's just this week. Xbox sent out all the emails to people this week. So check your Xboxes, kids.

1411
02:14:20,420 --> 02:14:26,420
If you have an Xbox that was manufactured before October 23rd, 2003, you better get a new power corridor.

1412
02:14:26,420 --> 02:14:28,420
There might be a fire! A bad fire!

1413
02:14:28,420 --> 02:14:30,420
Fry-cro-soft.

1414
02:14:30,420 --> 02:14:33,420
Fry-cro-soft. Alright.

1415
02:14:33,420 --> 02:14:42,420
One other thing I wanted to bring up, it's not really Brumani related per se, but I think this is pretty cool and needs to be discussed.

1416
02:14:42,420 --> 02:14:48,620
discussed, is that a new game has been announced. Games are Fun ran the story on this, and they

1417
02:14:48,620 --> 02:14:55,260
got some screenshots from Mario Kart GP. And guys, this is not a new console game, this

1418
02:14:55,260 --> 02:15:02,180
is a new arcade game. Mario Kart arcade. Discussed. Bitch, is you all going down? It's gonna have

1419
02:15:02,180 --> 02:15:06,180
Pac-Man and Ms. Pac-Man in it, and it's put up by Namco. Yep, because Namco and Nintendo

1420
02:15:06,180 --> 02:15:10,140
teamed up for this. Here's the thing I'm wondering, and it's the thing that I've been wondering

1421
02:15:10,140 --> 02:15:18,660
a while. It's on Triforce hardware. Triforce, three companies. Namco, Nintendo, and Sega.

1422
02:15:18,660 --> 02:15:23,540
Yes, Sega being the one. Where are the Sega characters? Yeah, that's a good question.

1423
02:15:23,540 --> 02:15:27,780
You know, Sega has better things they could be doing, like putting out another Knight's

1424
02:15:27,780 --> 02:15:33,140
game. Damn it. But, come on, having Sonic in Mario Kart, wouldn't that be the weirdest

1425
02:15:33,140 --> 02:15:39,500
thing ever? God, I shouldn't have a car. I guess that's a good point. Okay, so Sonic

1426
02:15:39,500 --> 02:15:42,880
And it would be like in Sonic R.

1427
02:15:42,880 --> 02:15:46,120
Sonic does not get a car.

1428
02:15:46,120 --> 02:15:50,280
Sonic does not get a car.

1429
02:15:50,280 --> 02:15:51,760
How much do you wanna bet?

1430
02:15:51,760 --> 02:15:56,640
This is gonna be tied in with either another Mario Kart game that's gonna be released for

1431
02:15:56,640 --> 02:16:02,060
the like the GameCube or the new console.

1432
02:16:02,060 --> 02:16:06,120
Yeah, because it looks like you know, cuz that was the way F-Zero worked, is that it

1433
02:16:06,120 --> 02:16:13,560
kind of teamed up with one one of the home versions there so it should be a

1434
02:16:13,560 --> 02:16:21,640
card game you can save your progress anyway it looks very cool it does have

1435
02:16:21,640 --> 02:16:25,160
actually it does have the card and Mario Kart is supposed to have the card system

1436
02:16:25,160 --> 02:16:31,520
with it very good just like f-zero did you know what huh I'm very it's very

1437
02:16:31,520 --> 02:16:35,760
interesting that they're using so many card games now you know back when the

1438
02:16:35,760 --> 02:16:38,560
The Neo Geo's were first kind of big.

1439
02:16:38,560 --> 02:16:39,560
God, I remember those.

1440
02:16:39,560 --> 02:16:41,260
They were supposed to have it.

1441
02:16:41,260 --> 02:16:47,060
And I remember watching this back on, um, what was the, what was the show?

1442
02:16:47,060 --> 02:16:48,960
It was the GamePro show.

1443
02:16:48,960 --> 02:16:50,520
Oh, God.

1444
02:16:50,520 --> 02:16:53,560
You know the GamePro show was filmed locally here in this area?

1445
02:16:53,560 --> 02:16:55,760
Oh, I lived in Alabama at the time.

1446
02:16:55,760 --> 02:16:57,480
Well, yeah, it was filmed at the Channel 3 studios.

1447
02:16:57,480 --> 02:16:58,480
Isn't that weird?

1448
02:16:58,480 --> 02:17:02,520
But I remember where, um, you were supposed to have a memory card that worked from your

1449
02:17:02,520 --> 02:17:05,280
Neo Geo home system to the arcade systems.

1450
02:17:05,280 --> 02:17:08,640
between the MVS and the AVS

1451
02:17:08,640 --> 02:17:11,960
I never, and I actually saw

1452
02:17:11,960 --> 02:17:15,400
the machine, you know you can look on the old Neo Geo machines

1453
02:17:15,400 --> 02:17:18,720
and actually see the card readers on them. Would it be maybe that that didn't catch on

1454
02:17:18,720 --> 02:17:22,440
because nobody owned a Neo Geo because of the price? Now granted I know you own a Neo Geo

1455
02:17:22,440 --> 02:17:24,080
but you are an exception to the rule.

1456
02:17:24,080 --> 02:17:27,680
That's because me and Dan are cool. Yeah, I mean you got

1457
02:17:27,680 --> 02:17:31,000
man, it's like cheaper than buying the arcade system. Seriously!

1458
02:17:31,000 --> 02:17:35,160
You might as well have bought the arcade system for how much that thing costs. I don't know, he'll have to correct me on this one but I think

1459
02:17:35,160 --> 02:17:40,000
he traded a Sega CD for it but that's the thing is that really that's why it

1460
02:17:40,000 --> 02:17:43,800
was so damn much because in a way you were getting the arcade system on your

1461
02:17:43,800 --> 02:17:51,440
TV with the same damn thing so crazy alright we're gonna go to a break boys

1462
02:17:51,440 --> 02:17:54,360
and girls so we can tally up the cage match votes and when we come back we're

1463
02:17:54,360 --> 02:17:57,160
gonna get into the FUs of the week please don't send in your FUs the week

1464
02:17:57,160 --> 02:17:59,400
just yet though I got to get the cage match out of the way and then we'll

1465
02:17:59,400 --> 02:18:03,640
accept those I'll let you know when so whoa excuse me we will be back after

1466
02:18:03,640 --> 02:18:07,840
this with more excuse me how unprofessional but when was the show

1467
02:18:07,840 --> 02:18:10,840
ever professional more orange on trader we're gonna start off this break with

1468
02:18:10,840 --> 02:18:14,120
something Jamie wanted to hear and I think this is an appropriate song

1469
02:18:14,120 --> 02:18:19,960
considering the Xbox news we just talked about. So we'll be back after this.

1470
02:18:44,120 --> 02:18:50,120
Realize my fire, cause I'm real

1471
02:18:50,120 --> 02:18:52,120
No more

1472
02:18:52,120 --> 02:18:54,120
Stayin' on the down, I'm takin' higher

1473
02:18:54,120 --> 02:18:56,120
Feel your body burnin' whippin' by one step

1474
02:18:56,120 --> 02:18:58,120
A little closer

1475
02:18:58,120 --> 02:19:00,120
Turn around and shake it like you're a poster

1476
02:19:00,120 --> 02:19:02,120
A rollercoaster

1477
02:19:02,120 --> 02:19:04,120
About this time I'll make a suggestion

1478
02:19:04,120 --> 02:19:06,120
Get on the dance floor and use this stretchy hip hop

1479
02:19:06,120 --> 02:19:08,120
And when I find the spot

1480
02:19:08,120 --> 02:19:10,120
Realize my fire

1481
02:19:10,120 --> 02:19:22,120
Your love is my only desire Realize the fire over me

1482
02:19:22,120 --> 02:19:29,120
Realize the fire Your love is my only desire

1483
02:19:29,120 --> 02:19:36,120
Realize the fire over me

1484
02:19:36,120 --> 02:19:37,120
Come on!

1485
02:21:06,120 --> 02:21:07,120
Let's go!

1486
02:21:07,120 --> 02:21:08,120
Let's go!

1487
02:21:08,120 --> 02:21:09,120
Let's go!

1488
02:21:09,120 --> 02:21:36,120
Thanks for watching!

1489
02:21:39,120 --> 02:21:41,120
Thank you very much.

1490
02:22:39,120 --> 02:22:41,120
Yeah

1491
02:23:39,120 --> 02:23:41,120
I'm on fire!

1492
02:23:41,120 --> 02:23:43,120
I'm on fire!

1493
02:23:47,120 --> 02:23:49,120
I'm on fire!

1494
02:23:49,120 --> 02:24:17,120
Come on, lady, come and go Come on, lady, girl, you have to write

1495
02:24:17,120 --> 02:24:21,820
Night's a danger, not the best it's mean

1496
02:24:21,820 --> 02:24:23,620
Yeah, rock it, rock it, rock it, rock it

1497
02:24:23,620 --> 02:24:26,120
I'm a singer, so I'll also make my name

1498
02:24:26,120 --> 02:24:28,120
I'll make it if you know how

1499
02:24:28,120 --> 02:24:31,120
I like to be a person for me

1500
02:24:31,120 --> 02:24:34,620
Night's on fire, you better, better think

1501
02:24:34,620 --> 02:24:37,620
You better, better be in the grave to say

1502
02:24:37,620 --> 02:24:40,620
Night's on fire, you're the lover over me

1503
02:24:40,620 --> 02:24:43,620
You're the lover over the rock, you're never me

1504
02:24:43,620 --> 02:24:45,620
You're a nightfall fire

1505
02:24:45,620 --> 02:24:47,120
You've got a plan of things

1506
02:24:47,120 --> 02:24:49,120
You've got a battle for the end of dreams

1507
02:24:49,120 --> 02:24:50,120
To play

1508
02:24:50,120 --> 02:24:51,620
Nightfall fire

1509
02:24:51,620 --> 02:24:53,120
Come over for the beat

1510
02:24:53,120 --> 02:24:54,620
Come over for the set

1511
02:24:54,620 --> 02:24:56,620
You're a nightfall fire

1512
02:25:01,120 --> 02:25:03,120
You're a nightfall fire

1513
02:25:03,120 --> 02:25:15,920
Mr. Random person on the street, who by the way is not an actor, what do you think of

1514
02:25:15,920 --> 02:25:18,220
the orange lounge being on a music and more show?

1515
02:25:18,220 --> 02:25:25,760
The music is like being transported to just this dancing spaceship place.

1516
02:25:25,760 --> 02:25:27,980
It's unearthly.

1517
02:25:27,980 --> 02:25:32,520
It's like being at a club except you don't have to actually ask someone to dance.

1518
02:25:32,520 --> 02:25:38,600
We are back here on Orange Lawns Radio, and we're going to get into the FUs of the Week.

1519
02:25:38,600 --> 02:25:42,400
But first, boys and girls, I bet you are dying to know who won tonight's cage match.

1520
02:25:42,400 --> 02:25:45,240
Tweet, tweet, tweet, tweet.

1521
02:25:45,240 --> 02:25:46,240
Chirp!

1522
02:25:46,240 --> 02:25:48,000
Sorry, we're all dead.

1523
02:25:48,000 --> 02:25:49,000
That's right.

1524
02:25:49,000 --> 02:25:50,000
Actually, actually.

1525
02:25:50,000 --> 02:25:51,000
Thanks.

1526
02:25:51,000 --> 02:25:54,960
All right, well, here it is.

1527
02:25:54,960 --> 02:26:03,960
cage match was so close that only one vote separated a tie between two songs

1528
02:26:03,960 --> 02:26:09,120
from the third song so one vote any other way could have swung it completely

1529
02:26:09,120 --> 02:26:15,680
different so here are the two songs that are tied tonight song number one is

1530
02:26:15,680 --> 02:26:26,620
freeze-pop again and song number three is the other one that tied song number

1531
02:26:26,620 --> 02:26:32,000
two being one vote behind so in the orange lounge rules to do it states that

1532
02:26:32,000 --> 02:26:37,560
the host whose song did not tie gets to break the tie so Jamie is it gonna be

1533
02:26:37,560 --> 02:26:44,560
Freezepop or Tekkakekka? Freezepop. Freezepop is the winner once again!

1534
02:26:47,240 --> 02:26:53,240
Just because I want to irritate the people who don't like it.

1535
02:26:53,240 --> 02:26:56,320
Alright. Freezepop wins

1536
02:26:56,320 --> 02:27:00,240
for the third week in a row. Guess what boys and girls? If it wins next week it

1537
02:27:00,240 --> 02:27:01,920
will be the third song

1538
02:27:01,920 --> 02:27:05,040
in Orange Lounge history to get retired

1539
02:27:05,040 --> 02:27:09,840
from the Orange Lounge Cage Match. The other ones being Gwen Stefani, Whatcha Waitin' For

1540
02:27:09,840 --> 02:27:13,360
and Echo Image, Come Back are the two other songs that have been retired.

1541
02:27:15,200 --> 02:27:19,200
I can't believe that Gwen Stefani went those whole four weeks. Have you heard her new single, though?

1542
02:27:19,760 --> 02:27:22,880
It's hot. It's totally hot. I'm gonna put it in the Cage Match later.

1543
02:27:23,920 --> 02:27:30,000
If I was a rich girl. Anyway, sorry. You know what? That's from Fiddler on the Roof.

1544
02:27:30,000 --> 02:27:37,200
It is, but it's awesome, and in the video they're all dressed up like pirates.

1545
02:27:37,200 --> 02:27:41,840
Why should they be dressed up as pirates for a song that's from...

1546
02:27:41,840 --> 02:27:42,840
Because it's MTV.

1547
02:27:42,840 --> 02:27:48,360
It's from a play about Russian Jews.

1548
02:27:48,360 --> 02:27:49,760
Okay?

1549
02:27:49,760 --> 02:27:51,160
That's...

1550
02:27:51,160 --> 02:27:53,920
Has anybody ever...

1551
02:27:53,920 --> 02:27:57,320
I was gonna say, isn't that your girlfriend, Loki?

1552
02:27:57,320 --> 02:27:59,320
Fiddler on the Roof?

1553
02:27:59,320 --> 02:28:03,320
She would qualify the Russian Jew part, yes.

1554
02:28:05,320 --> 02:28:09,320
I'm gonna start calling your girlfriend Fiddler on the Roof.

1555
02:28:10,320 --> 02:28:15,320
When Stefani, like, now has dropped in my esteem.

1556
02:28:15,320 --> 02:28:17,320
But she's cool!

1557
02:28:17,320 --> 02:28:22,320
But she's being an idiot. And I don't appreciate idiots.

1558
02:28:24,320 --> 02:28:25,320
Alright.

1559
02:28:25,320 --> 02:28:27,320
But we need to do the effus now.

1560
02:28:27,320 --> 02:28:32,920
Okay, and why is it that we do these FUs of the week every single week?

1561
02:28:32,920 --> 02:28:34,920
Because of Gwen Stefani!

1562
02:28:34,920 --> 02:28:56,260
Fuck musicians who think they can get away with taking something that was perfectly fine

1563
02:28:56,260 --> 02:29:01,940
the way it was and completely misinterpreting it in such a horrible way.

1564
02:29:01,940 --> 02:29:07,740
you Gwen Stefani right in your ear because your ass isn't good enough in

1565
02:29:07,740 --> 02:29:11,120
fact your ass is probably never mind I won't say anything you know what's

1566
02:29:11,120 --> 02:29:17,860
ironic is that she's dating a guy from a band named Bush and thank you Gavin for

1567
02:29:17,860 --> 02:29:28,060
dating her oh damn somebody just got told that's exactly what your fiance in

1568
02:29:28,060 --> 02:29:30,060
I mean, the chat room just said, somebody just got told.

1569
02:29:30,060 --> 02:29:32,060
Alright, that's awesome.

1570
02:29:32,060 --> 02:29:35,060
Um, an F.U. goes to, uh...

1571
02:29:35,060 --> 02:29:41,060
See, I drove past an accident yesterday that was caused by an old person driving a car.

1572
02:29:41,060 --> 02:29:48,060
They need to make people, once they hit a certain age, take a very strict driving test.

1573
02:29:48,060 --> 02:29:54,060
Another F.U. goes towards idiots who drive SUVs.

1574
02:29:54,060 --> 02:30:00,060
I can understand driving an SUV if you have a legitimate need for it, but...

1575
02:30:00,060 --> 02:30:02,060
Like you go camping every week.

1576
02:30:02,060 --> 02:30:10,060
Yeah, I can go camping. You know what? Back in the 80s, they had these things called station wagons to cart your children around in.

1577
02:30:10,060 --> 02:30:19,060
If you're going to breed and carry other people's spawn with you, don't drive a fucking SUV, drive a station wagon.

1578
02:30:19,060 --> 02:30:22,060
I'm going to get a hearse to cart my children around in.

1579
02:30:22,060 --> 02:30:24,060
That'd be awesome.

1580
02:30:24,060 --> 02:30:30,060
Another thing, don't fucking drive while you talk on your goddamn cell phone.

1581
02:30:32,060 --> 02:30:36,060
Bad rob.

1582
02:30:36,060 --> 02:30:40,180
I cannot wait until this is made illegal

1583
02:30:40,180 --> 02:30:43,740
because it is proven

1584
02:30:43,740 --> 02:30:47,420
that you drive, that you know the people in general do not pay

1585
02:30:47,420 --> 02:30:52,060
as much attention to the road as you would if you were not talking on your cell

1586
02:30:52,060 --> 02:30:52,540
phone

1587
02:30:52,540 --> 02:30:55,780
you know first of all

1588
02:30:55,780 --> 02:30:59,940
do you drive with your laptop on? Okay never mind there are people who do that

1589
02:30:59,940 --> 02:31:01,740
If I could

1590
02:31:01,740 --> 02:31:04,740
Cause people are fucking retards too.

1591
02:31:04,740 --> 02:31:09,740
If we're gonna ban cell phone usage, can we ban people who put on makeup while driving then too?

1592
02:31:09,740 --> 02:31:10,740
You know what, that...

1593
02:31:10,740 --> 02:31:16,740
I almost got hit with someone driving with a laptop on their lap.

1594
02:31:16,740 --> 02:31:20,740
Another thing is just people who think that they need to be one car ahead.

1595
02:31:20,740 --> 02:31:21,740
Oh, that I hate.

1596
02:31:21,740 --> 02:31:22,740
Oh my god, your car...

1597
02:31:22,740 --> 02:31:26,740
And I can understand if the person is actually going 20 miles under the speed limit in front of you,

1598
02:31:26,740 --> 02:31:28,740
because then they are a safety hazard.

1599
02:31:28,740 --> 02:31:36,740
But if I'm going, normally I tend to speed a little bit. I drive about five to ten miles over the speed limit sometimes.

1600
02:31:36,740 --> 02:31:53,740
But when someone passes me, no, that's just inexcusable. Nothing is, you don't need to be somewhere in so much of a hurry that you should endanger your lives and the lives of everybody else on the road.

1601
02:31:53,740 --> 02:31:57,420
really care about the person driving, because you know what, if they die, that's Darwinism

1602
02:31:57,420 --> 02:32:03,940
at work. You know, but when they hurt other people in the process because of their stupidity,

1603
02:32:03,940 --> 02:32:07,620
that's where I draw the line. Now if they decide to run off the overpass into the river

1604
02:32:07,620 --> 02:32:17,620
and they're the only ones hurt, fine. You know. Another thing is, I am bad at this,

1605
02:32:17,620 --> 02:32:23,340
I am getting better, but I don't ride up on people's asses. You know, I do have an issue

1606
02:32:23,340 --> 02:32:28,340
with my following distance, but I don't drive all the way up on somebody's bumper where

1607
02:32:28,340 --> 02:32:34,860
if, you know, the person in front of me stopped, I wouldn't have any time. There was this person

1608
02:32:34,860 --> 02:32:41,460
who was right on my ass driving home from work the other day, and I'm just glad that

1609
02:32:41,460 --> 02:32:45,660
I had good breaks, because I actually did have to stop very quickly to avoid hitting

1610
02:32:45,660 --> 02:32:52,660
an animal, and the person came very close to running into my rear end, so I kind of

1611
02:32:54,020 --> 02:32:57,700
wish that they had so I could, you know, make them go through all the hassle of getting

1612
02:32:57,700 --> 02:33:01,980
worse and, you know, having their insurance rate go up, but, you know, I had better things

1613
02:33:01,980 --> 02:33:08,980
to do with my time. But that's really it. It's mostly about drivers.

1614
02:33:09,180 --> 02:33:13,260
Alright, let's go on to Loki. I have one more.

1615
02:33:13,260 --> 02:33:15,260
Okay, let's not go on to Loki.

1616
02:33:15,260 --> 02:33:18,260
People who think that diet pills are the ways to lose weight.

1617
02:33:18,260 --> 02:33:21,260
You know how to lose weight? Get off your ass and work it off.

1618
02:33:23,260 --> 02:33:24,260
That's it.

1619
02:33:24,260 --> 02:33:26,260
Okay. You sure?

1620
02:33:26,260 --> 02:33:27,260
Alright.

1621
02:33:27,260 --> 02:33:29,260
Alright. Loki!

1622
02:33:29,260 --> 02:33:31,260
And dust. Fuck you, dust.

1623
02:33:31,260 --> 02:33:34,260
Fuck you to my cold.

1624
02:33:34,260 --> 02:33:36,260
It sucked.

1625
02:33:36,260 --> 02:33:38,260
Still stuffed up.

1626
02:33:38,260 --> 02:33:40,260
Been all tired.

1627
02:33:40,260 --> 02:33:42,260
No tired. Tired bad.

1628
02:33:42,260 --> 02:33:52,260
And, uh, fucking to my computer for being broken, because I'm gonna have withdrawals, especially now that I think I've realized that Brad hasn't returned Grand Theft Auto San Andreas yet.

1629
02:33:52,260 --> 02:34:00,260
So I don't know what I'm gonna do now. Does that mean I have to finish playing, uh, Wind Waker? I guess so.

1630
02:34:00,260 --> 02:34:05,260
And then, finally, the most important one of them all!

1631
02:34:05,260 --> 02:34:09,260
Fuck you, Golf Land! Fuck you and your ugly asses!

1632
02:34:09,260 --> 02:34:13,460
Fuck you, Keith! Fuck you, management of Golf Land and Roseville Golf Land!

1633
02:34:13,460 --> 02:34:18,260
Thank you, cause you know, I love to be taxed on my own fucking money!

1634
02:34:18,260 --> 02:34:21,860
Let's flashback here to the summer, when I got to build

1635
02:34:21,860 --> 02:34:26,460
a brand new set mania cabinet for Golf Land. I did this as purely as a favor, because

1636
02:34:26,460 --> 02:34:31,360
their sales had sucked, no one's come to the arcade, the scene had basically died.

1637
02:34:31,360 --> 02:34:36,360
So, what was my deal with them? I would charge them for parts, they would reimburse me, the end.

1638
02:34:36,360 --> 02:34:40,360
Okay, they would have a wonderful cabinet, I would do all the labor for free, that's it.

1639
02:34:41,360 --> 02:34:49,360
So, a thousand dollars later, you know, I have this cabinet that's built here, they go to pay me, and they're dragging their feet.

1640
02:34:49,360 --> 02:34:54,360
They don't wanna, you know, they're just like, oh Keith's never there, oh the check's on its way, da da da da da.

1641
02:34:54,360 --> 02:35:00,860
so it's been dragging and dragging and finally I get paid and then they have

1642
02:35:00,860 --> 02:35:07,440
the audacity to send me a 1099 for it a 1099 for my own money that they were

1643
02:35:07,440 --> 02:35:11,220
supposed to be reimbursed me for why am I getting taxed on my own money fuck them

1644
02:35:11,220 --> 02:35:20,400
fuck them um a 1098 for one that you pay taxes no 1099 are the ones they get

1645
02:35:20,400 --> 02:35:27,120
tax on its miscellaneous income and actually I think you're meaning a w-2

1646
02:35:27,120 --> 02:35:31,260
no it's a 1099 nobody's right it is the 1099 oh never mind you're right you're

1647
02:35:31,260 --> 02:35:39,040
right right right w-2s are for wages I guess they also put out 1099, 1098, and

1648
02:35:39,040 --> 02:35:45,800
5498 and W2Gs. They put out 1099s for returned funds for us I work in

1649
02:35:45,800 --> 02:35:49,340
mortgage they put out 1099s for foreclosures and bankruptcies too. Yes because I know

1650
02:35:49,340 --> 02:35:58,340
I know what these are because I get them from, um, our work for, you know, our fifth cards, so, you know, that's cool that we get those and stuff.

1651
02:35:58,340 --> 02:36:05,340
So taxes! You know how much that's gonna cost me, Golf Land? That's gonna cost me $150 out of my pocket for your stupid shit.

1652
02:36:05,340 --> 02:36:07,340
Good concept.

1653
02:36:07,340 --> 02:36:09,340
Take them to Smockland's Court.

1654
02:36:09,340 --> 02:36:11,340
It's really not worth it, you know? It's really not.

1655
02:36:11,340 --> 02:36:13,340
A machine, by the way, which no longer operates.

1656
02:36:13,340 --> 02:36:17,340
Yeah, the machine's been stolen, it's been converted back, er, you know, whatever.

1657
02:36:17,340 --> 02:36:19,340
Take the check to Golfie to make them pay it.

1658
02:36:19,340 --> 02:36:25,340
It's not worth it, honestly, because it was hard enough to get them to pay for it.

1659
02:36:25,340 --> 02:36:27,340
It's not worth my time.

1660
02:36:27,340 --> 02:36:31,340
You know what, I always say it's worth time to prove somebody wrong.

1661
02:36:31,340 --> 02:36:38,340
No, here's the thing, the only reason they were going to have a 1099 for me before,

1662
02:36:38,340 --> 02:36:41,340
because they said, oh well you don't have the receipts for it anymore.

1663
02:36:41,340 --> 02:36:45,340
Bullshit, I gave those to Keith, he knew he had them, he lost them, that's it.

1664
02:36:45,340 --> 02:36:50,020
it so I I didn't think to make copies because I didn't think it's gonna be a

1665
02:36:50,020 --> 02:36:54,100
problem so anyway so then so they figured out way what they're gonna do is

1666
02:36:54,100 --> 02:36:57,180
they're gonna make this fake invoice okay and make it look like I'm some

1667
02:36:57,180 --> 02:37:00,900
computer company and then they're gonna give voices to that so I wouldn't get

1668
02:37:00,900 --> 02:37:05,420
you know charged a 1099 port and that was the deal that was you know they

1669
02:37:05,420 --> 02:37:08,660
made it clear that I wasn't gonna get a 1099 for it and that everything was all

1670
02:37:08,660 --> 02:37:13,440
good and I was done well guess what they gave me a 1099 anyway go into the

1671
02:37:13,440 --> 02:37:16,440
and take back $150 in parts out of the machine.

1672
02:37:16,440 --> 02:37:19,440
I can't really do that.

1673
02:37:19,440 --> 02:37:20,440
For their idiocy.

1674
02:37:20,440 --> 02:37:22,440
Well, that'd be theft.

1675
02:37:22,440 --> 02:37:24,440
I'd pursue it.

1676
02:37:24,440 --> 02:37:27,440
So, yeah, they fucked me over again.

1677
02:37:27,440 --> 02:37:33,440
Just go in there with a chocolate gun and wave it around.

1678
02:37:33,440 --> 02:37:36,440
I sent an email to Keith, who wasn't very nice,

1679
02:37:36,440 --> 02:37:39,440
and, you know, he hasn't responded. Surprise.

1680
02:37:39,440 --> 02:37:41,440
Never ever responds, so, you know what, fuck him.

1681
02:37:41,440 --> 02:37:46,440
And I'm officially, you know, I'm boycotting Golf Land, I'm not going back there ever again.

1682
02:37:46,440 --> 02:37:51,440
And I would urge everyone else to do the same, because they're just gonna fuck everyone over, so...

1683
02:37:51,440 --> 02:37:53,440
Just enjoy.

1684
02:37:53,440 --> 02:37:57,440
I lost, actually, on that cabinet, over $230.

1685
02:37:57,440 --> 02:37:59,440
So thank you, Golf Land, you know.

1686
02:37:59,440 --> 02:38:03,440
No, this is what I get for doing you guys a favor. Thanks a lot.

1687
02:38:03,440 --> 02:38:05,440
I'm done.

1688
02:38:05,440 --> 02:38:08,440
Alrighty, moving on.

1689
02:38:08,440 --> 02:38:21,440
How can I follow that one up? F you to myself because I have a whole stack of tests to correct and I haven't started yet and I have to have them done by tomorrow morning.

1690
02:38:21,440 --> 02:38:25,440
But hey, I got better things to do like play Final Fantasy and WarioWare.

1691
02:38:25,440 --> 02:38:45,440
And a nephew to WarioWare for being too short. I'm already all the way through it. I have one unlock left to get, and it's the unlock that you would get when you get a flower on every single minigame. And that's going to take me too long to get, so I said fuck it. So, that's it. I really don't have a lot of interesting to say.

1692
02:38:45,440 --> 02:38:47,440
We need to put the parrot.

1693
02:38:47,440 --> 02:38:49,440
The parrot was cool.

1694
02:38:49,440 --> 02:38:54,440
And the last unlock I got was a soundtrack thing.

1695
02:38:54,440 --> 02:38:57,440
So now I can get Ashley's theme song.

1696
02:38:57,440 --> 02:39:01,440
Because I'm uninterrupted and the theme song for Ashley is cool.

1697
02:39:01,440 --> 02:39:03,440
So I'm going to rip the theme song.

1698
02:39:03,440 --> 02:39:05,440
Because it's rad.

1699
02:39:05,440 --> 02:39:08,440
Let's go to our guest FUs.

1700
02:39:08,440 --> 02:39:11,440
I guess we'll start it off with explicit.

1701
02:39:11,440 --> 02:39:22,440
Well, now that I found out everybody was already talking about the FUs already, Jamie was talking about the SEVs, I was going to say the same thing, so my FE goes to that section.

1702
02:39:22,440 --> 02:39:36,440
And the FE to RVGL, I think Logi explained most of that, some of that already. Let's see. Oh yeah, big FE goes to fucking parents who blame it on the media.

1703
02:39:36,440 --> 02:39:49,840
Okay, an F.V. goes to parents accusing the media for actions that kids commit all for

1704
02:39:49,840 --> 02:39:54,880
their own, what they think is a bad influence to kids.

1705
02:39:54,880 --> 02:40:02,240
First of all, if you're going to let your kids play stuff like Halo 2 or Grand Theft

1706
02:40:02,240 --> 02:40:05,440
part of San Andreas you should know what the consequences are and tell your kids

1707
02:40:05,440 --> 02:40:12,800
how what not to do and I mean talk to your kids don't blame it on the media

1708
02:40:12,800 --> 02:40:22,680
for such actions I mean you bought from the game I was about to get there too

1709
02:40:22,680 --> 02:40:28,720
I mean parents are the most responsible ones for the issues we had a lot we had

1710
02:40:28,720 --> 02:40:42,720
My aunt just had a lawsuit with some games. For some reason I told her that it's not really worth the lawsuit.

1711
02:40:42,720 --> 02:40:49,720
They treat their kids the wrong way and that's all I'm about to say.

1712
02:40:49,720 --> 02:40:57,720
FV goes to, of course, they have already discussed this before, the Milpies Golf Land issue with pads.

1713
02:40:57,720 --> 02:41:08,720
They should have switched it within the groove pads, and hopefully they make sure that the pads are going to be well for March Madness 2k5.

1714
02:41:08,720 --> 02:41:13,720
But to make sure everything calms down, I'll say to be continued for now.

1715
02:41:13,720 --> 02:41:16,720
Alright then, Angel's turn to get ranty.

1716
02:41:16,720 --> 02:41:20,720
Of you to know internet for two days, that sucked.

1717
02:41:20,720 --> 02:41:24,720
Yeah.

1718
02:41:24,720 --> 02:41:28,720
And of you to have Final Fantasy XI not working, that sucks.

1719
02:41:28,720 --> 02:41:32,720
It black screens right after the play online stuff's over.

1720
02:41:32,720 --> 02:41:36,720
And I think it might have to do with the last update we just had.

1721
02:41:36,720 --> 02:41:40,720
I don't know what's up with that. Damn it, I want to play.

1722
02:41:40,720 --> 02:41:44,720
Call Squeenix and call him a bunch of fucking fuckers.

1723
02:41:44,720 --> 02:41:55,760
maybe and if you don't like a you know the holiday weekend because it went too

1724
02:41:55,760 --> 02:42:00,660
fast again so you know tomorrow's the last day of that be glad you get a

1725
02:42:00,660 --> 02:42:04,780
holiday weekend sit down sit down actually it doesn't really count because

1726
02:42:04,780 --> 02:42:09,020
Friday and Monday don't have school anyway so it's like just a regular week

1727
02:42:09,020 --> 02:42:15,820
for me anyway except for maybe possible things being closed tomorrow other than

1728
02:42:15,820 --> 02:42:21,620
that you know it's just a regular week for me

1729
02:42:22,020 --> 02:42:34,620
all right let's go on to the chat room FUs started off with dark lion xvi one

1730
02:42:34,620 --> 02:42:40,700
FU for tonight. FU to the chat room for teasing me about the way I laugh. I don't give a flying

1731
02:42:40,700 --> 02:42:45,340
fuck what you guys say about my laugh. I laugh the way I wanted to, so in the words of Yoda,

1732
02:42:45,340 --> 02:42:53,780
up the shut fuck. Preach on, brother. RPGKing7 says, first, thanks for reading my FU last

1733
02:42:53,780 --> 02:43:00,380
week. You're welcome. I actually think it would be up the shut fuck. Shut up. RPGKing7

1734
02:43:00,380 --> 02:43:04,900
says, thanks for reading my F.U. last week. You're welcome. This week, F.U. to kill Steelers

1735

1736
02:43:14,700 --> 02:43:20,000
me to call into OrangeLawn's radio now, only to take the spot himself. Now I feel the need

1737
02:43:20,000 --> 02:43:26,860
to pwn him at Guilty Gear X to reload again. Ouch. It's on. It's on. Somebody just got

1738
02:43:26,860 --> 02:43:31,640
served. MPQ says, F you to Final Fantasy 11 for not working on my computer. F you to my

1739
02:43:31,640 --> 02:43:35,980
computer for not being capable of playing real games. F you to game tracks for letting

1740
02:43:35,980 --> 02:43:41,580
the DDR machine slowly die. F you to myself for getting so emo over Final Fantasy 11 not

1741
02:43:41,580 --> 02:43:50,720
working. F you to EB, any comments for that Angel? Uh, call Squeenix? F you to EB for

1742
02:43:50,720 --> 02:43:54,880
not giving me cash back for the game not working so I had to buy something else. And F you

1743
02:43:54,880 --> 02:44:01,420
to iTunes for not having real good music available. Hey, do a search for an iMix called Dance

1744
02:44:01,420 --> 02:44:05,580
Dance Revolution and it says Orange Laundrio's name in the description and it's all a whole

1745
02:44:05,580 --> 02:44:09,980
bunch of Dance Dance Revolution songs. I put it together and it's on iTunes. Look for it.

1746
02:44:09,980 --> 02:44:14,480
I'll find a link. Maybe I can find a link. Mikolatov says, first FU of the week goes

1747
02:44:14,480 --> 02:44:20,460
to gaming expenses. E3 plus PSP plus night style equals pornus. Second FU goes to my

1748
02:44:20,460 --> 02:44:24,240
Nintendo DS. I have two games and they are the only two games I want for the next several

1749
02:44:24,240 --> 02:44:28,960
months therefore I may trade it in towards my PSP purchase. Final F.U. goes

1750
02:44:28,960 --> 02:44:35,220
to my car smelling like burning every time I drive it. Bugz says F.U. to no

1751
02:44:35,220 --> 02:44:42,160
naked hot tubbing this week I'm a demub ass. Sephiroth1215 or 1215 or

1752
02:44:42,160 --> 02:44:47,260
1215 says F.U. to all the snow that is falling right now and an F.U. for the

1753
02:44:47,260 --> 02:44:53,160
difficulty being raised all the way up on the DDR machine. Illusion says F.U. to

1754
02:44:53,160 --> 02:44:59,560
Shakeys not having the regular I got you babe to do karaoke to they had some lame remix with bad synth in it

1755
02:44:59,920 --> 02:45:03,680
Anyway, it was totally lame and not gay enough for the incredibly homoerotic

1756
02:45:03,680 --> 02:45:09,220
I got you babe karaoke that I was doing with Larry a big burly construction worker from the bay that whispers sweet

1757
02:45:09,220 --> 02:45:11,220
Nothing's into my ear at night

1758
02:45:12,080 --> 02:45:14,080
Huh

1759
02:45:14,440 --> 02:45:16,440
Huh

1760
02:45:16,440 --> 02:45:19,180
Just just a wake-up call if you guys are falling asleep there

1761
02:45:19,180 --> 02:45:25,420
Anyway, FU to this week for going by so slow but that it was only 4 days long.

1762
02:45:25,420 --> 02:45:29,980
Illusions says FU to Gwen Stefani for selling out and her crappy new song that makes me

1763
02:45:29,980 --> 02:45:32,420
cry.

1764
02:45:32,420 --> 02:45:35,420
John Fields says huge FU to NCSX.

1765
02:45:35,420 --> 02:45:40,780
I waited 12 days and you still haven't gotten PlayStation, er, PlayStation, Phantasy Star

1766
02:45:40,780 --> 02:45:42,740
Online episode 4 in.

1767
02:45:42,740 --> 02:45:44,300
I had to go with Haumea.

1768
02:45:44,300 --> 02:45:45,300
FU.

1769
02:45:45,300 --> 02:45:52,300
F you to not having enough hours in a week. DJ Ranma S says F you to a friend of mine

1770
02:45:52,340 --> 02:45:56,260
for being a dick to this girl I know. Payback's a bitch, cause I'm gonna go for it while you

1771
02:45:56,260 --> 02:46:03,180
waller in your own self-pity. Let's have tea! I love that name. Let's have tea. I like tea.

1772
02:46:03,180 --> 02:46:07,580
I need tea right now, cause my voice is in a horse. That's a very pleasant name. Which

1773
02:46:07,580 --> 02:46:13,340
so doesn't work for this segment. So I'm renaming this person Let's Have Evil Tea. You know

1774
02:46:13,340 --> 02:46:14,340
That'd be funny.

1775
02:46:14,340 --> 02:46:15,340
What?

1776
02:46:15,340 --> 02:46:18,340
Um, well, it's kind of random.

1777
02:46:18,340 --> 02:46:19,340
Okay.

1778
02:46:19,340 --> 02:46:23,180
Um, but you know how we were talking about earlier, how they have those slash whatevers?

1779
02:46:23,180 --> 02:46:24,180
Yeah.

1780
02:46:24,180 --> 02:46:30,140
Okay, well, if you're like constipated, you can have slash logout.

1781
02:46:30,140 --> 02:46:34,140
Ha ha, ha ha ha ha.

1782
02:46:34,140 --> 02:46:35,380
That was nasty.

1783
02:46:35,380 --> 02:46:36,900
I hate you.

1784
02:46:36,900 --> 02:46:41,860
Let's have tea, says F you to the guy who hit my stepdad's SUV earlier today.

1785
02:46:41,860 --> 02:46:47,020
got flipped and totaled. That's what you get for having an SUV? Hey, hey, hey, that's not

1786
02:46:47,020 --> 02:46:53,780
nice. He has a... Or it might be a she, sorry. They have a pleasant name. I think it was

1787
02:46:53,780 --> 02:47:00,780
Julie who drove by a wreck where an SUV and like a minivan ran into each other and the

1788
02:47:00,780 --> 02:47:04,980
SUV rolled and landed on the minivan. No matter what kind of car you drive, people... I think

1789
02:47:04,980 --> 02:47:08,900
about two birds with one stone. I mean, what... I mean, SUVs are so big in the first place,

1790
02:47:08,900 --> 02:47:13,900
to take a lot of talent to crash into one so I mean come on tell your dad to

1791
02:47:13,900 --> 02:47:20,940
like get a real car now stepdad one of one that's got a lower center of gravity

1792
02:47:20,940 --> 02:47:26,420
legends that who says f you to elements of my school student body aka the elitist

1793
02:47:26,420 --> 02:47:31,140
for dropping emo bombs last week over the n-word being used in a play in my

1794
02:47:31,140 --> 02:47:36,340
school that illustrates the horrors of slavery America has a way of driving the

1795
02:47:36,340 --> 02:47:39,900
point across that slavery was really fucked up back then which is I in my

1796
02:47:39,900 --> 02:47:45,100
humble opinion the best way to do it okay I know I'm old okay but what the

1797
02:47:45,100 --> 02:47:50,580
hell's an emo bomb well you know what what emo is emo is that you know I'm so

1798
02:47:50,580 --> 02:47:58,340
sad I'm gonna slash my wrist because I'm so sad you know it's basically modern

1799
02:47:58,340 --> 02:48:04,540
god yeah kind of modern Gotham happy colors okay so basically it's like the

1800
02:48:04,540 --> 02:48:08,840
people who bag on movies without seeing them like they bag on dogma for being a

1801
02:48:08,840 --> 02:48:12,340
satanic movie without realizing that it's actually a pretty religious movie

1802
02:48:12,340 --> 02:48:16,180
at heart I think that's kind of the point Zach was trying to make here f you

1803
02:48:16,180 --> 02:48:20,740
to freeze pop infecting the ears of orange launch radio listeners and f you

1804
02:48:20,740 --> 02:48:24,940
to tonight's internet connection at my campus causing causing major skipping in

1805
02:48:24,940 --> 02:48:30,180
and then he got cut off dark night says one f you to squeamish for making the

1806
02:48:30,180 --> 02:48:37,640
cutscenes in Star Ocean too darn long. I have to add another one. Okay. F you to the

1807
02:48:37,640 --> 02:48:45,060
burning sensation of liquid daquil. And Let's Have Tea would just like to follow

1808
02:48:45,060 --> 02:48:53,100
up the ever-pleasant Let's Have Tea. He did get a real car, a Corvette. Forgiven.

1809
02:48:53,100 --> 02:48:57,620
Alright, we're gonna do a quickie break and when we come back we'll do a little

questions now for Ask Orange Lounge, and in this break, gotcha!

1812
02:50:32,660 --> 02:50:40,660
If you can say goodbye, baby, tell me why

1813
02:50:46,660 --> 02:50:53,660
You say that love is not a possession You say that love needs fantasy

1814
02:50:53,660 --> 02:51:00,660
You say we must fear this devotion But you don't say that you love me

1815
02:51:00,660 --> 02:51:07,660
Sometimes I wonder what I'm doing Sometimes I'm cold and serious

1816
02:51:07,660 --> 02:51:14,660
But when you touch my body and close your eyes My little baby, I don't realize

1817
02:51:14,660 --> 02:51:22,660
If you can say goodbye, baby, tell me why You don't wanna love me just like I do

1818
02:51:22,660 --> 02:51:27,660
You can say goodbye, tell me what I've got to do

1819
02:51:29,660 --> 02:51:33,660
If you can say goodbye, baby tell me why

1820
02:51:34,660 --> 02:51:36,660
You don't wanna love me, just like I do

1821
02:51:36,660 --> 02:51:42,660
Just like I do, you can't say goodbye Tell me what I've got to do

1822
02:52:06,660 --> 02:52:13,660
Rock over London. Rock over Chicago. Orange Lounge Radio. It's a good place to listen

1823
02:52:13,660 --> 02:52:18,660
to the music.

1824
02:52:18,660 --> 02:52:23,840
We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio, and we're about ready to wrap up tonight's show,

1825
02:52:23,840 --> 02:52:28,100
but darn it, it's time for you guys to contribute a little something to this train wreck of

1826
02:52:28,100 --> 02:52:35,660
a show, so we're gonna do a little bit of Ask Orange Lounge.

1827
02:52:35,660 --> 02:52:38,060
we're playing on the webcam right now by the way I hope you guys are watching

1828
02:52:38,060 --> 02:52:41,420
over there it's kind of fun www.orangeloungeradio.com anyway let's get into this

1829
02:52:41,420 --> 02:52:44,220
week's Ask Orange Lounge

1830
02:52:48,060 --> 02:52:53,860
let's ask orange lounge some stupid question what will we find out this week

1831
02:52:53,860 --> 02:53:00,900
on orange lounge radio is there a point to this segment I don't think so it's

1832
02:53:00,900 --> 02:53:16,580
only here to fill a little time question from RPG King 7 question is what is

1833
02:53:16,580 --> 02:53:24,100
everyone in the lounges opinions of us Canadians what do we think of Canadians

1834
02:53:24,100 --> 02:53:30,720
they're from Canada I know Loki's thinking of something horrible to say

1835
02:53:30,720 --> 02:53:34,600
say here. I'm not thinking anything horrible. No, honestly, Canadians are cool. They've

1836
02:53:34,600 --> 02:53:39,800
got, you know, laxer laws up there, it seems like, you know, and it's just, you know, it's

1837
02:53:39,800 --> 02:53:45,280
a little cold for my taste, but... It's just cold. It's just, you know, it's cool. I mean,

1838
02:53:45,280 --> 02:53:49,160
I don't think anything wrong against Canadians. They got the gay marriage thing up there.

1839
02:53:49,160 --> 02:53:52,680
They're ahead of the game as far as I'm concerned. They've got that stuff going for them. But

1840
02:53:52,680 --> 02:53:56,680
here's my problem with Canada. If I went to Canada, I'd be out of a job, because I work

1841
02:53:56,680 --> 02:54:00,200
in the health care industry, and they've got the nationalized health care thing going on,

1842
02:54:00,200 --> 02:54:01,200
I'd be out of a job.

1843
02:54:01,200 --> 02:54:06,960
Well, the only thing I don't like is French Canadians, but that's just because I don't

1844
02:54:06,960 --> 02:54:07,960
like the French.

1845
02:54:07,960 --> 02:54:09,460
No one likes the French Canadians.

1846
02:54:09,460 --> 02:54:10,460
That's not true.

1847
02:54:10,460 --> 02:54:11,460
I'm kidding.

1848
02:54:11,460 --> 02:54:17,320
So, I mean, and there's other, hey, you know, Canada gave us Jim Carrey, you know.

1849
02:54:17,320 --> 02:54:18,800
And Alanis Morissette, my favorite.

1850
02:54:18,800 --> 02:54:24,640
Yeah, well, okay, they gave us Jim Carrey, and, um, shut up.

1851
02:54:24,640 --> 02:54:29,100
And they also gave us Tom, oh wait, no, no, Tom Green.

1852
02:54:29,100 --> 02:54:32,020
You can have Tom Greenback, actually.

1853
02:54:32,020 --> 02:54:36,980
Dan says, too nice, too close, and too quiet.

1854
02:54:36,980 --> 02:54:38,480
Yeah, you know, what are they plotting?

1855
02:54:38,480 --> 02:54:39,900
They all live near the border up there, you know.

1856
02:54:39,900 --> 02:54:40,580
No, I'm kidding.

1857
02:54:40,580 --> 02:54:46,260
Actually, I went, years ago, I went to Vancouver and Victoria Island.

1858
02:54:46,260 --> 02:54:48,340
I thought it was just beautiful out there.

1859
02:54:48,340 --> 02:54:51,820
That would be a place I could live if it wasn't so goddamn cold and rainy.

1860
02:54:51,820 --> 02:54:53,900
But it's beautiful out there.

1861
02:54:53,900 --> 02:54:55,220
It's great.

1862
02:54:55,220 --> 02:54:58,100
I do not, I can safely say I have no issues with Canada.

1863
02:54:58,100 --> 02:55:01,740
and I've met a lot of very cool Canadians online. The weird thing is they

1864
02:55:01,740 --> 02:55:03,080
like all live in Toronto

1865
02:55:03,080 --> 02:55:07,340
which is, I guess Toronto's where it's at. Go Leafs!

1866
02:55:07,340 --> 02:55:10,480
Well, yeah,

1867
02:55:10,480 --> 02:55:14,040
um, they have good musicians. That's all I gotta say.

1868
02:55:14,040 --> 02:55:17,780
Shatner's Canadian? Oh God.

1869
02:55:17,780 --> 02:55:21,020
Rob already said Alanis Morissette, so I gotta say Berniculides, cuz, yeah.

1870
02:55:21,020 --> 02:55:24,740
Or Celine Dion? Moving on.

1871
02:55:24,740 --> 02:55:28,180
Well the game is Jim Carrey. I know.

1872
02:55:28,180 --> 02:55:31,900
What about Bryan Adams? Legend of Zaku says,

1873
02:55:31,900 --> 02:55:35,860
seeing that you guys are the drinking type, have you ever thought of creating

1874
02:55:35,860 --> 02:55:38,300
some Bamani themed cocktail drinks?

1875
02:55:38,300 --> 02:55:41,740
My fire,

1876
02:55:41,740 --> 02:55:48,740
like Goldschlager and... Max 300, Goldschlager, Jagermeister, and 151 all

1877
02:55:48,740 --> 02:55:55,300
51 all mixed together.

1878
02:55:55,300 --> 02:55:56,300
I don't know.

1879
02:55:56,300 --> 02:55:57,300
I don't know.

1880
02:55:57,300 --> 02:55:58,300
I don't know.

1881
02:55:58,300 --> 02:56:06,500
I imagine some dork out there has thought of something.

1882
02:56:06,500 --> 02:56:08,580
Maybe that's a thread we should start on the forums.

1883
02:56:08,580 --> 02:56:10,420
See what people can come up with a drink.

1884
02:56:10,420 --> 02:56:13,100
You know, I have a friend who's going to bartending school.

1885
02:56:13,100 --> 02:56:16,280
So what I'll do is I will ask him to come up with some new drinks.

1886
02:56:16,280 --> 02:56:17,280
Maybe he's even listening.

1887
02:56:17,280 --> 02:56:23,280
He's starting Bartender School this week. I'll ask him to try and come up with some new drinks, and when he tells me what's in it, I will give them names.

1888
02:56:23,280 --> 02:56:25,280
And we will come up with a Bomani drink.

1889
02:56:25,280 --> 02:56:29,280
We could use the one that I made with the orange juice and the Malibu.

1890
02:56:29,280 --> 02:56:30,280
I remember that. That was pretty good.

1891
02:56:30,280 --> 02:56:32,280
That can be Summer Love.

1892
02:56:32,280 --> 02:56:33,280
My Summer Love?

1893
02:56:33,280 --> 02:56:34,280
My Summer Love.

1894
02:56:34,280 --> 02:56:35,280
I was thinking the same thing.

1895
02:56:35,280 --> 02:56:36,280
Okay. Anyway.

1896
02:56:40,280 --> 02:56:41,280
Miklatov.

1897
02:56:41,280 --> 02:56:45,280
Dear Ask Orange Lounge, please make some E3 plans.

1898
02:56:45,280 --> 02:56:46,280
Alright, stop bugging me.

1899
02:56:46,280 --> 02:56:51,200
and boom boom dollar was not on DER first mix meaning it had no basic step

1900
02:56:51,200 --> 02:56:52,280
rating hey buddy

1901
02:56:52,280 --> 02:56:55,360
it was on US first mix

1902
02:56:55,360 --> 02:56:59,560
which was basically just the Japanese first mix imported

1903
02:56:59,560 --> 02:57:06,680
or 1.5 mix. MPQ says why do laptops make shitty

1904
02:57:06,680 --> 02:57:11,080
gaming PCs? DarkSakura who has a laptop in her lap care to answer

1905
02:57:11,080 --> 02:57:15,080
I haven't actually tried to run any games on this although I could install the

1906
02:57:15,080 --> 02:57:23,280
Actually, my laptop would probably be very good for gaming, because I've got a G-Force

1907
02:57:23,280 --> 02:57:32,400
in here, and I've got a 3.06 processor, and a bunch of RAM.

1908
02:57:32,400 --> 02:57:33,400
Mine would run Final Fantasy XI.

1909
02:57:33,400 --> 02:57:37,000
I'm going to download the benchmark and see if my laptop would run Final Fantasy XI.

1910
02:57:37,000 --> 02:57:39,500
Just so I can laugh.

1911
02:57:39,500 --> 02:57:40,500
You know what?

1912
02:57:40,500 --> 02:57:43,520
I think part of the problem, at least with older laptops, newer ones don't do this so

1913
02:57:43,520 --> 02:57:44,520
much, but the older ones?

1914
02:57:44,520 --> 02:57:49,520
Like, if you change the way you're looking at the screen, it gets lighter and darker, like it's just the way the display works.

1915
02:57:49,520 --> 02:57:50,520
It's just an LCD screen.

1916
02:57:50,520 --> 02:57:54,520
Exactly, and that annoyed the shit out of me, but new ones don't really have that problem.

1917
02:57:54,520 --> 02:57:55,520
That's not a problem.

1918
02:57:55,520 --> 02:57:57,520
I know, but I'm thinking about old ones.

1919
02:57:57,520 --> 02:58:03,520
The problem is that laptops are generation behind, usually, and they're also very expensive.

1920
02:58:03,520 --> 02:58:07,520
Also, since they're passively cooled and they don't have any actual fans inside of them,

1921
02:58:07,520 --> 02:58:17,520
You get really hot and you can't put all that expensive, you know, high-powered, you know, devices and stuff, video cards, sound cards, all that stuff in there.

1922
02:58:17,520 --> 02:58:31,520
Now, granted, Alienware does make laptops, and they can get some pretty decent laptops out there, but when it's gonna come, you know, between laptop and, you know, PC, you're gonna be better off with a PC.

1923
02:58:31,520 --> 02:58:33,520
For the money.

1924
02:58:33,520 --> 02:58:54,520
Alright, let's see here. Al Mullet wants to ask, as a future newbie to Beatmania 2DX, there are quite a few songs I haven't heard yet. What would be your favorites to play? Maybe one favorite song to play in 2DX. Mine would be Deadline, as horrid as that song is. I absolutely love that song, Deadline 5th Style.

1925
02:58:54,520 --> 02:59:02,520
I used to be really fond of playing Sync, but now it would probably have to be, I actually really did call it, on both levels, so.

1926
02:59:02,520 --> 02:59:08,520
When you're first getting started and you're still playing one-stars, Five Fathoms on Third Style is pretty rad and it has the right video.

1927
02:59:08,520 --> 02:59:09,520
Five Fathoms, that would be the one.

1928
02:59:09,520 --> 02:59:11,520
Five Fathoms is like the best song to learn on for one-star.

1929
02:59:11,520 --> 02:59:16,520
Yeah, it's the one with the DDR in the video, like the old-ass DDR that had Boom Boom Dollar in it.

1930
02:59:16,520 --> 02:59:17,520
Mikutov.

1931
02:59:17,520 --> 02:59:24,520
Let's see, we got a lot of questions in a little time. I'm going to try and get through as many of these as we can.

1932
02:59:24,520 --> 02:59:26,520
You can still submit some, though, if you want. I'm looking through some.

1933
02:59:26,520 --> 02:59:32,520
John Fields says, Hey Sky, why isn't this show or station listed on the Wikipedia?

1934
02:59:32,520 --> 02:59:38,520
I'm somewhat familiar with Wikipedia. Is that like the user-created encyclopedia?

1935
02:59:38,520 --> 02:59:45,520
Kind of like, what do they call that Mozilla database of all the sites? Free web or something?

1936
02:59:45,520 --> 02:59:47,520
I found Mobile, Alabama on the Wikipedia.

1937
02:59:47,520 --> 02:59:51,520
You know what, I just have no idea how to hook something like that up.

1938
02:59:51,520 --> 02:59:55,520
like that up. If somebody wants to send me an email and tell me how to do it, Rob at

1939
02:59:55,520 --> 02:59:59,440
OrangeLoungeRadio.com or if you just want to submit it, as long as you don't talk shit

1940
02:59:59,440 --> 03:00:04,520
about it, you have my blessings. And I imagine DarkSacker and Loki feel the same way, yes?

1941
03:00:04,520 --> 03:00:08,800
Whatever. Yeah, don't fuck it up. That's all we ask.

1942
03:00:08,800 --> 03:00:15,880
Let's Have Tea would like to know, what is the high score in Orange Lounge Radio Pinball?

1943
03:00:15,880 --> 03:00:20,280
Little known fact, before I got into DDR, I was a pinball whore. I really loved pinball.

1944
03:00:20,280 --> 03:00:24,280
Rob was the pinball wizard. He was blind and used to be called Tommy.

1945
03:00:24,280 --> 03:00:33,280
My favorite ones, I always liked the Return from Mars game that had the little animations that were inside it.

1946
03:00:33,280 --> 03:00:36,280
You know they actually did one for Star Wars Episode I as well.

1947
03:00:36,280 --> 03:00:37,280
They had a little hologram one.

1948
03:00:37,280 --> 03:00:41,280
And as much as I am not huge into Star Wars, that pinball game was pretty cool.

1949
03:00:41,280 --> 03:00:46,280
I would have to say my very favorite pinball machine, though, was probably the Addams Family.

1950
03:00:46,280 --> 03:00:48,280
But lots of people liked that machine.

1951
03:00:48,280 --> 03:00:49,280
House of Magic.

1952
03:00:49,280 --> 03:00:54,400
House of Magic's awesome, too. Those are probably two of the top tables out there. Another one

1953
03:00:54,400 --> 03:00:59,960
that I always liked was Pinbot, which is kind of a running joke on outside the box when

1954
03:00:59,960 --> 03:01:04,440
it's actually on the air. But Pinbot's a really cool one, too. I always liked that one. And

1955
03:01:04,440 --> 03:01:07,800
the NES version, not the same. In fact, it's very much not the same.

1956
03:01:07,800 --> 03:01:14,720
What was I going to say? My favorite time playing, what was it, Invasion of Mars or

1957
03:01:14,720 --> 03:01:21,120
whatever that one was called, Return to Mars, was when we rubber banded, we opened up the

1958
03:01:21,120 --> 03:01:27,680
machine and rubber banded down the two sides and so the ball can only be lost through the

1959
03:01:27,680 --> 03:01:33,160
center and we'd play like to the end of the game on that. It was fun.

1960
03:01:33,160 --> 03:01:39,800
I want my bike night 2000. But my pinball machine when I went to the University of South

1961
03:01:39,800 --> 03:01:50,680
Alabama was World Cup soccer, 94, because I was always really good at hitting the goal.

1962
03:01:50,680 --> 03:01:57,740
And Dan and I, a little after I first moved out here, we used to go to Godfather's Pizza

1963
03:01:57,740 --> 03:02:03,200
in Thomas and play Last Action Hero pinball all the time.

1964
03:02:03,200 --> 03:02:08,380
Ooh, JasonXB brings up a good point in the chat room, some PC pinball games that were

1965
03:02:08,380 --> 03:02:12,820
actually really good, Epic Pinball. The Epic Pinball games were awesome.

1966
03:02:12,820 --> 03:02:17,080
You can get Pin Mame. Pin Mame's not the same to me. I would rather

1967
03:02:17,080 --> 03:02:20,800
play Epic Pinball than Pin Mame. Epic Pinball I bet's in Abandonware probably

1968
03:02:20,800 --> 03:02:24,400
right now. Probably. As much as I think Pin Mame is an awesome

1969
03:02:24,400 --> 03:02:29,360
idea and I totally support the project, it just... I don't know. It doesn't work for

1970
03:02:29,360 --> 03:02:35,560
me. It doesn't... I think it's because I prefer the tables that were created for the PC. On

1971
03:02:35,560 --> 03:02:40,160
a PC if that makes any sense I don't know there's some really good virtual

1972
03:02:40,160 --> 03:02:46,160
tables there I used to have and if anybody can think of this and private

1973
03:02:46,160 --> 03:02:50,120
message me the pinball game that this was I would love you forever there was a

1974
03:02:50,120 --> 03:02:56,280
pinball game I used to have on my old ass PC my hundred megahertz PC and it

1975
03:02:56,280 --> 03:03:00,640
had four tables in it one of them was like a haunted house I think the other

1976
03:03:00,640 --> 03:03:06,320
one was a raceway, one of them was a circus, and I remember the circus table was a demo

1977
03:03:06,320 --> 03:03:09,500
you could download on the internet, but then there was another one called, like, Billion

1978
03:03:09,500 --> 03:03:14,320
Dollar Game Show or something. It was a game and it had four tables. It wasn't Epic, it

1979
03:03:14,320 --> 03:03:18,840
was some other pinball game. If I could find that again, I would be so happy. Did Sierra

1980
03:03:18,840 --> 03:03:22,200
make a pinball game? I don't think it was Sierra either, I think it was some other unknown

1981
03:03:22,200 --> 03:03:27,680
company. Well, I saw one of the people, I talked to one of the people at E3, um, last

1982
03:03:27,680 --> 03:03:33,240
year who said that they were working on a pinball game for the PS2 that was

1983
03:03:33,240 --> 03:03:37,800
supposed to emulate a bunch of the old tables hmm that's cool and I'm not sure

1984
03:03:37,800 --> 03:03:42,160
which ones were gonna be on there they only had like a basic you know just

1985
03:03:42,160 --> 03:03:46,640
generic table for demo but I heard that I'd asked about they said they were

1986
03:03:46,640 --> 03:03:52,560
seeking some licenses or something hmm I want them to actually go to Capcom and

1987
03:03:52,560 --> 03:03:57,660
produce the it was when I had brought up on the show before that Dan showed me

1988
03:03:57,660 --> 03:04:02,380
there's only like I think 16 of them in existence and I can't remember the name

1989
03:04:02,380 --> 03:04:10,020
of it it was something bar the he needs to p.m. me the name of it I'm as soon as

1990
03:04:10,020 --> 03:04:14,600
I get it I'll tell you but I had like the little dancing girl in the background

1991
03:04:14,600 --> 03:04:20,020
you could play the family edition or the non family edition and it was I can't

1992
03:04:20,020 --> 03:04:28,260
remember the name of it now their most shittiest the shittiest pinball game I

1993
03:04:28,260 --> 03:04:38,060
think I've ever played was dr. dude it was awful you know what somebody in the

1994
03:04:38,060 --> 03:04:44,380
chat room is posting a suggestion for the game that I that they think it is

1995
03:04:44,380 --> 03:04:50,540
and it was big bang that was thank you hyper 3d pinball you know what I think I

1996
03:04:50,540 --> 03:04:55,380
own this game but I don't think it's the same one I'm trying to think of right

1997
03:04:55,380 --> 03:05:00,140
now I'm trying to find more pictures of it it's making me mad I think it might

1998
03:05:00,140 --> 03:05:06,100
be by the same company but it wasn't that game I don't remember darn it oh

1999
03:05:06,100 --> 03:05:09,060
well we only have a little bit of show left okay I appreciate you guys trying

2000
03:05:09,060 --> 03:05:13,060
I'm posting pictures of this table in the chatroom.

2001
03:05:13,060 --> 03:05:25,060
But that's the one, and they only made a few of them because this was in production right before Capcom's pinball division went out.

2002
03:05:25,060 --> 03:05:30,060
I want a pinball table. I want a Black Knight 2000 machine.

2003
03:05:30,060 --> 03:05:37,060
Somebody's suggesting that maybe it's extreme pinball?

2004
03:05:37,060 --> 03:05:41,060
And yes, I, I will, um, oh my gosh, I think this is it.

2005
03:05:44,060 --> 03:05:50,060
Uh oh. No, no, I don't think it is. Oh, I think I have that game too, but that's not the one I'm thinking of.

2006
03:05:50,060 --> 03:05:57,060
I'm not sure. Anyways. I can't tell! I'm so upset, because I really want this. You guys don't understand, I want this game again.

2007
03:06:00,060 --> 03:06:05,060
Grr. No, that's not it. Darn it. Oh well. Maybe someday.

2008
03:06:05,060 --> 03:06:09,220
Okay, um, let's see. What we're gonna do now is we're gonna go around and get everybody's...

2009
03:06:09,220 --> 03:06:11,700
Oh, I'll do one more question, really quick.

2010
03:06:11,700 --> 03:06:13,900
Uh, Allusion, and sorry to those guys we didn't get to.

2011
03:06:13,900 --> 03:06:14,700
Allusion asks,

2012
03:06:14,700 --> 03:06:20,380
Hey guys, I have a question. What did you do for Valentine's Day? Did you get shagged up vigorously?

2013
03:06:20,380 --> 03:06:25,140
I had chocolate cheese pie.

2014
03:06:25,140 --> 03:06:28,900
I had dinner with my boy.

2015
03:06:28,900 --> 03:06:30,900
And then I went to school on actual Valentine's Day.

2016
03:06:34,900 --> 03:06:36,900
Alright. I made pasta.

2017
03:06:37,900 --> 03:06:39,900
And then I got shagged vigorously.

2018
03:06:41,900 --> 03:06:45,900
I did not get shagged vigorously this Valentine's Day, but that's okay.

2019
03:06:46,900 --> 03:06:48,900
I can deal with rejection.

2020
03:06:50,900 --> 03:06:52,900
It's time to go around and get everybody's final thought.

2021
03:06:52,900 --> 03:06:54,900
Thank you guys for tuning into Orange Launch Radio tonight.

2022
03:06:54,900 --> 03:06:58,900
Let's start it off with Explicit. Your final thought, please.

2023
03:06:58,900 --> 03:07:00,900
Jamie, get Will soon.

2024
03:07:00,900 --> 03:07:03,900
Angel, your final thought.

2025
03:07:03,900 --> 03:07:06,900
Final Finishing. Must work-y. Dang it.

2026
03:07:06,900 --> 03:07:09,900
Loki, your final thought.

2027
03:07:09,900 --> 03:07:14,900
I'm only down to two PCs now. What am I to do?

2028
03:07:14,900 --> 03:07:21,900
My final thought is, um, when will Outside the Box return? Nobody knows.

2029
03:07:21,900 --> 03:07:23,900
DarkSakura, your final thought?

2030
03:07:23,900 --> 03:07:26,900
I won a Black Knight 2000 pinball machine.

2031
03:07:26,900 --> 03:07:31,900
That's it, guys. Thanks for tuning in. Check out our podcast, dammit!

2032
03:07:31,900 --> 03:07:34,900
DarkSakura, you can have tonight's final word.

2033
03:07:34,900 --> 03:07:36,900
Oh, final word.

2034
03:07:36,900 --> 03:07:41,900
The final word of the evening is...

2039
03:08:40,860 --> 03:08:41,860
No luck, Tango.

2040
03:08:41,860 --> 03:08:42,860
Sosora.

2041
03:08:43,660 --> 03:08:44,660
Lipshit.

2042
03:08:49,660 --> 03:08:50,660
Pop.

2043
03:08:51,660 --> 03:08:52,660
Sit.

2044
03:08:53,160 --> 03:08:54,160
Switch.

2045
03:08:55,660 --> 03:08:56,660
Uh-uh.

2046
03:08:57,660 --> 03:08:58,660
Sosora.

2047
03:08:59,660 --> 03:09:00,660
Lipshit.

2048
03:09:01,660 --> 03:09:02,660
Pop.

2049
03:09:03,660 --> 03:09:04,660
Switch.

2050
03:09:04,660 --> 03:09:05,660
Uh-uh.

2051
03:09:05,660 --> 03:09:06,660
Sosora.

2052
03:09:07,660 --> 03:09:08,660
Lipshit.

2053
03:09:09,660 --> 03:09:10,660
Pop.

2054
03:09:10,660 --> 03:09:24,660
He had it comin', he had it comin', he only had himself to blame.

2055
03:09:24,660 --> 03:09:32,660
If you'd have been there, if you'd have seen it, I bet you you wouldn't have done the same.

2056
03:09:32,660 --> 03:09:35,660
The best flesh I've ever wished

2057
03:09:35,660 --> 03:09:39,660
The best flesh I've ever wished

2058
03:09:39,660 --> 03:09:43,660
You know how people have these little habits that get you down?

2059
03:09:43,660 --> 03:09:44,660
Like...

2060
03:09:44,660 --> 03:09:45,660
Bernie.

2061
03:09:45,660 --> 03:09:47,660
Bernie likes to chew gum.

2062
03:09:47,660 --> 03:09:49,660
No, not chew.

2063
03:09:49,660 --> 03:09:50,660
Pop.

2064
03:09:50,660 --> 03:09:55,660
So I came home this one day and I'm really irritated and I'm looking for a little bit of sympathy.

2065
03:09:55,660 --> 03:10:00,660
And there's Bernie, lying on the couch, drinking a beer and chewing.

2066
03:10:00,660 --> 03:10:02,660
No, not chewing.

2067
03:10:02,660 --> 03:10:03,660
Poppin'!

2068
03:10:03,660 --> 03:10:09,660
So I said to him, I said, you pop that gum one more time.

2069
03:10:09,660 --> 03:10:11,660
And he did.

2070
03:10:11,660 --> 03:10:16,660
So I took the shotgun off the wall and I fired two warning shots.

2071
03:10:16,660 --> 03:10:20,660
Into his head.

2072
03:10:20,660 --> 03:10:24,660
He had it comin', he had it comin'

2073
03:10:24,660 --> 03:10:28,660
He only had it felt so plain

2074
03:10:28,660 --> 03:10:35,660
If you'd have been there, if you'd have heard it, I betcha you would have done the same

2075
03:10:42,660 --> 03:10:46,660
I met Ezekiel Young from Salt Lake City about two years ago

2076
03:10:46,660 --> 03:10:49,660
And he told me he was single, and we hit it off right away

2077
03:10:49,660 --> 03:10:53,660
So we started living together, he'd go to work, he'd come home

2078
03:10:53,660 --> 03:10:56,660
I'd fix him a drink, we'd have dinner

2079
03:10:56,660 --> 03:11:06,300
and then I found out single he told me single my ass not only was he married he

2080
03:11:06,300 --> 03:11:12,020
had six wives one of those Mormons you know so that night when he came home

2081
03:11:12,020 --> 03:11:20,220
from work I fixed in his drink as usual you know some guys just can't hold their

2082
03:11:20,220 --> 03:11:43,080
Now I'm standing in the kitchen carving up the chicken for dinner minding my own business

2083
03:11:43,080 --> 03:11:47,900
in storms my husband will burn in jealous rage you've been screwing the milk man he

2084
03:11:47,900 --> 03:11:54,500
He was crazy and he kept on screaming you've been screwing the milk man, and then he ran into my knife

2085
03:11:55,100 --> 03:11:57,420
He ran into my knife ten times

2086
03:12:07,420 --> 03:12:09,420
Me get a shaker

2087
03:12:09,420 --> 03:12:11,980
Most my yucca here. It's locum left on my fear

2088
03:12:12,700 --> 03:12:14,700
in the glitch of the movie

2089
03:12:14,700 --> 03:12:43,580
My sister Veronica and I had this double act, and my husband Charlie traveled around with

2090
03:12:43,580 --> 03:12:49,260
us. Now for the last number in our act we did these 20 acrobatic tricks in a row. One, two,

2091
03:12:49,260 --> 03:12:54,300
three, four, five splits, spread eagles, backflips, flip flops, one right after the other.

2092
03:12:55,100 --> 03:12:59,820
So this one night before the show we're down at the hotel Cicero, the three of us

2093
03:12:59,820 --> 03:13:07,420
boozing, having a few laughs, and we run out of ice so I go out to get some. I come back,

2094
03:13:07,420 --> 03:13:16,660
open the door and there's Veronica and Charlie doing number 17 the spread eagle

2095
03:13:16,660 --> 03:13:21,820
well I was in such a state of shock I completely blacked out I can't remember

2096
03:13:21,820 --> 03:13:27,220
a thing it wasn't until later when I was washing the blood off my hands I even

2097
03:13:27,220 --> 03:13:29,220
knew they were dead.

2098
03:13:57,220 --> 03:14:00,220
Could you tell me that I was wrong?

2099
03:14:01,220 --> 03:14:04,220
I loved Al Lipschitz more than I could possibly say.

2100
03:14:04,220 --> 03:14:06,220
He was a real artistic guy.

2101
03:14:06,220 --> 03:14:07,220
Sensitive.

2102
03:14:07,220 --> 03:14:08,220
A painter.

2103
03:14:08,220 --> 03:14:11,220
But he was always trying to find himself.

2104
03:14:11,220 --> 03:14:13,220
He'd go out every night looking for himself.

2105
03:14:13,220 --> 03:14:20,220
And on the way, he found Ruth, Gladys, Rosemary, and Irving.

2106
03:14:20,220 --> 03:14:23,220
I guess you could say we broke up because of artistic differences.

2107
03:14:23,220 --> 03:14:25,220
He saw himself as alive.

2108
03:14:25,220 --> 03:14:27,220
And I saw him dead.

2109
03:15:25,220 --> 03:15:32,660
Thank you very much for listening, and we'll see you next week.

2110
03:15:55,220 --> 03:16:07,100
Okay, we figured it out. It's either Pinball Dreams or Pinball Fantasies. They're both

2111
03:16:07,100 --> 03:16:11,500
made by the same developer. They're very similar. So I'm going to check them both out. That

2112
03:16:11,500 --> 03:16:14,340
was it, though. When I do the image search in Google, I get the images of the game I

2113
03:16:14,340 --> 03:16:20,260
remember. So thank you, Jason, for helping me find that out. So I'm very happy. It's

2114
03:16:20,260 --> 03:16:25,140
either Pinball Dreams or Pinball Fantasies. One is the sequel to the other. So that was

2115
