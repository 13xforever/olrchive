30
00:08:52,747 --> 00:08:54,148
[SPEAKER_09]: Our whole pre-show was kind of quiet.

31
00:08:54,168 --> 00:08:54,988
[SPEAKER_09]: Nobody said anything.

32
00:08:55,608 --> 00:08:56,009

[SPEAKER_09]: Jamie Summers.

38
00:09:05,870 --> 00:09:06,890
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm caffeinated today.

39
00:09:07,070 --> 00:09:07,791
[SPEAKER_17]: God, that's loud.

40
00:09:07,991 --> 00:09:09,591
[SPEAKER_09]: Wow, your mic is loud today.

41
00:09:10,512 --> 00:09:11,892
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, that's too loud for me.

42
00:09:11,932 --> 00:09:12,713
[SPEAKER_09]: That's a first.

43
00:09:12,893 --> 00:09:13,233
[SPEAKER_09]: Dang.

44
00:09:13,513 --> 00:09:16,794
[SPEAKER_09]: I wonder if we had to turn it up last week because somebody else was there last week.

45
00:09:16,975 --> 00:09:18,615
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't see how.

46
00:09:19,336 --> 00:09:20,336
[SPEAKER_17]: I hate sounding echoey.

47
00:09:20,816 --> 00:09:21,637
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, that is kind of weird.

48
00:09:21,657 --> 00:09:22,437
[SPEAKER_09]: I wonder what's going on with that.

49
00:09:22,457 --> 00:09:24,178
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll change that.

50
00:09:24,698 --> 00:09:26,239
[SPEAKER_13]: That's weird.

51
00:09:26,379 --> 00:09:26,999
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, well.

52
00:09:27,711 --> 00:09:28,412
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, it is kind of weird.

53
00:09:28,432 --> 00:09:29,132
[SPEAKER_09]: She sounds echoey.

54
00:09:29,893 --> 00:09:31,154
[SPEAKER_09]: Turn down her gain a little bit.

55
00:09:31,174 --> 00:09:32,174
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it's just her gain's up.

56
00:09:33,535 --> 00:09:34,456
[SPEAKER_09]: Gain?

57
00:09:35,417 --> 00:09:35,917
[SPEAKER_09]: Stop it.

58
00:09:38,419 --> 00:09:39,800
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, okay.

59
00:09:40,541 --> 00:09:43,263
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, say hello to Techmaster Loki while we're at it, I guess.

60
00:09:44,043 --> 00:09:46,465
[SPEAKER_09]: Hi, I'm fixing stuff.

61
00:09:47,166 --> 00:09:49,327
[SPEAKER_33]: I can't tell what microphone this is.

62
00:09:50,248 --> 00:09:51,729
[SPEAKER_09]: In beautiful Orange Lounge fashion.

63
00:09:52,449 --> 00:09:54,431
[SPEAKER_09]: Can't tell which wire's which in this place.

64
00:09:54,915 --> 00:09:56,696
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know what's on move.

65
00:09:56,916 --> 00:09:58,657
[SPEAKER_09]: Play with all of them until it changes.

66
00:09:58,717 --> 00:09:59,117
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

67
00:09:59,298 --> 00:10:00,018
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh wait, here we go.

68
00:10:00,158 --> 00:10:02,459
[SPEAKER_09]: I think this is it.

69
00:10:02,479 --> 00:10:02,960
[SPEAKER_09]: There you go.

70
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:05,241
[SPEAKER_09]: It does sound echo-y, though.

71
00:10:05,861 --> 00:10:06,582
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I don't know.

72
00:10:07,782 --> 00:10:08,463
[SPEAKER_09]: It sounds better now.

73
00:10:08,783 --> 00:10:10,044
[SPEAKER_33]: Stop speaking with an echo, then.

74
00:10:13,706 --> 00:10:16,447
[SPEAKER_17]: Apparently I'm an orange chef.

75
00:10:18,068 --> 00:10:20,950
[SPEAKER_09]: Say hello also to frequent guests of our program.

76
00:10:20,970 --> 00:10:21,910
[SPEAKER_09]: She's here again tonight.

77
00:10:21,950 --> 00:10:23,071
[SPEAKER_09]: Say hello to DDR Angel.

78
00:10:24,895 --> 00:10:25,235
[SPEAKER_16]: Hello.

79
00:10:27,257 --> 00:10:31,180
[SPEAKER_16]: Um... I just gave something to Robin.

80
00:10:31,220 --> 00:10:32,441
[SPEAKER_16]: All of a sudden he goes, ooh!

81
00:10:32,661 --> 00:10:34,402
[SPEAKER_16]: And I just completely lost my train of thought.

82
00:10:34,763 --> 00:10:35,203
[SPEAKER_16]: Wonderful!

83
00:10:35,703 --> 00:10:38,145
[SPEAKER_09]: DDR Angel knows how to kiss some ass around here.

84
00:10:38,205 --> 00:10:47,752
[SPEAKER_09]: She's brought me a bunch of Pepsi bottle caps that have the iTunes songs on them because she knows I'm like one of the only people that actually uses iTunes and actually purchases songs legally through iTunes.

85
00:10:48,113 --> 00:10:50,354
[SPEAKER_09]: So she's giving me free songs!

86
00:10:50,575 --> 00:10:51,195
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm so excited.

87
00:10:52,236 --> 00:10:53,657
[SPEAKER_09]: And then she's also brought me candy.

88
00:10:55,117 --> 00:10:56,838
[SPEAKER_09]: That is the best way to my heart.

89
00:10:56,918 --> 00:10:57,578
[SPEAKER_09]: Music and candy.

90
00:10:57,638 --> 00:10:58,718
[SPEAKER_14]: Have meat and caffeine.

91
00:10:59,719 --> 00:11:00,759
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, that works for you.

92
00:11:01,639 --> 00:11:02,600
[SPEAKER_17]: Meat and caffeine.

93
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:05,241
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'm music and candy.

94
00:11:05,641 --> 00:11:06,421
[SPEAKER_09]: What would Loki be?

95
00:11:08,202 --> 00:11:08,942
[SPEAKER_17]: Blood and guts.

96
00:11:09,722 --> 00:11:10,022
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe.

97
00:11:10,282 --> 00:11:10,782
[SPEAKER_17]: And porn.

98
00:11:11,943 --> 00:11:13,623
[SPEAKER_09]: And cooking, because that's what he's doing right now.

99
00:11:14,044 --> 00:11:15,944
[SPEAKER_09]: In fact, he's got our webcam in the kitchen.

100
00:11:15,984 --> 00:11:17,205
[SPEAKER_09]: What the hell?

101
00:11:17,445 --> 00:11:22,687
[SPEAKER_09]: www.orangeloungeradio.com Click on... Actually, you don't have to click on anything.

102
00:11:22,707 --> 00:11:23,947
[SPEAKER_09]: The webcam's right there on the front page.

103
00:11:25,006 --> 00:11:28,368
[SPEAKER_09]: And you can watch Loki cook, as exciting as that must be.

104
00:11:28,408 --> 00:11:29,249
[SPEAKER_09]: I have no idea why.

105
00:11:29,429 --> 00:11:30,910
[SPEAKER_09]: Why is the webcam in the kitchen?

106
00:11:31,230 --> 00:11:37,875
[SPEAKER_14]: Is this in response to the people always saying, You guys never have anything interesting on your webcam.

107
00:11:38,155 --> 00:11:40,396
[SPEAKER_14]: Your webcam is so boring.

108
00:11:41,197 --> 00:11:41,877
[SPEAKER_14]: Why do you even bother?

109
00:11:41,897 --> 00:11:49,322
[SPEAKER_33]: It's because there's, I mean, we only have one guest, Angel, I mean, and she's not even sitting on the couch, and so, you know, figured, what the hell.

110
00:11:50,363 --> 00:11:52,684
[SPEAKER_17]: I'll bring another old school game next weekend to showcase.

111
00:11:53,004 --> 00:11:53,805
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, that'll work.

112
00:11:54,346 --> 00:11:56,307
[SPEAKER_17]: I'll bring like the SNES and play Punch Out.

113
00:11:57,108 --> 00:11:57,448
[SPEAKER_08]: Awesome.

114
00:11:58,548 --> 00:12:03,811
[SPEAKER_17]: Actually, we broke out the PS1 today because we found that Nan's been playing Tempest X all day.

115
00:12:04,171 --> 00:12:04,692
[SPEAKER_08]: That's awesome.

116
00:12:05,492 --> 00:12:07,693
[SPEAKER_17]: As in the kind of crappy version of Tempest 2000.

117
00:12:09,494 --> 00:12:10,895
[SPEAKER_08]: Tempest is Tempest, my friend.

118
00:12:11,776 --> 00:12:14,437
[SPEAKER_08]: Although Tempest 2000 on the Jag was the best.

119
00:12:14,697 --> 00:12:15,938
[SPEAKER_17]: No, on the Saturn.

120
00:12:18,079 --> 00:12:21,221
[SPEAKER_09]: Tempest on the Jag was the only game worth getting a Jag for.

121
00:12:21,241 --> 00:12:21,781
[SPEAKER_17]: What about Defender 2000?

122
00:12:21,821 --> 00:12:21,881
[SPEAKER_17]: Bah.

123
00:12:24,369 --> 00:12:25,090
[SPEAKER_17]: No, there was another.

124
00:12:25,130 --> 00:12:26,371
[SPEAKER_17]: There was Alien vs. Predator.

125
00:12:28,193 --> 00:12:28,773
[SPEAKER_09]: I guess so.

126
00:12:28,993 --> 00:12:29,514
[SPEAKER_09]: I guess so.

127
00:12:30,375 --> 00:12:34,418
[SPEAKER_09]: That's about the only Aliens vs. Predator thing worth even remotely wasting your time with.

128
00:12:34,438 --> 00:12:34,939
[SPEAKER_21]: The arcade game?

129
00:12:35,659 --> 00:12:36,300
[SPEAKER_09]: Any arcade game.

130
00:12:36,460 --> 00:12:36,660
Yeah.

131
00:12:36,921 --> 00:12:37,601
[SPEAKER_09]: But not the movie.

132
00:12:39,263 --> 00:12:39,923
[SPEAKER_09]: That was my point.

133
00:12:39,983 --> 00:12:40,324
[SPEAKER_09]: Not the movie.

134
00:12:40,344 --> 00:12:40,984
[SPEAKER_17]: The comics were okay.

135
00:12:41,405 --> 00:12:41,685
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyway.

136
00:12:42,906 --> 00:12:43,206
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

137
00:12:44,047 --> 00:12:47,130
[SPEAKER_09]: We're here for the next three hours, you know, to talk about, you know, stuff.

138
00:12:49,212 --> 00:12:49,752
[SPEAKER_09]: How was your week?

139
00:12:49,772 --> 00:12:50,273
[SPEAKER_09]: How was your day?

140
00:12:50,313 --> 00:12:58,836
[SPEAKER_09]: And all your favorite segments, Cage Match, and maybe some Bomani news too, and if we run out of Bomani stuff, I guess we'll talk about other video game stuff, because we're dorks.

141
00:13:00,737 --> 00:13:05,620
[SPEAKER_09]: We're going to start off this break with a potpourri of Bomani music.

142
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:06,880
[SPEAKER_09]: There is no theme this break.

143
00:13:07,060 --> 00:13:08,301
[SPEAKER_09]: We're just going to play whatever the hell we want.

144
00:13:08,701 --> 00:13:11,302
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll start off with a song I want to hear, Shiny Disco Balls.

145
00:13:11,762 --> 00:13:14,103
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll be back after this with more Orange Lounge Radio, episode 132.

146
00:13:14,143 --> 00:13:15,104
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks for tuning in.

[SPEAKER_09]: Because Bongo demands it.

154
00:20:13,046 --> 00:20:15,607
[SPEAKER_09]: We are back here with more Orange Lounge Radio.

155
00:20:15,667 --> 00:20:20,310
[SPEAKER_09]: Hello, boys and girls, on this happy 220-2005.

156
00:20:21,490 --> 00:20:23,291
[SPEAKER_09]: That's a lot of twos and a lot of zeros.

157
00:20:23,932 --> 00:20:25,012
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

158
00:20:26,093 --> 00:20:26,413
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

159
00:20:26,893 --> 00:20:28,074
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm out of clever things to say.

160
00:20:28,114 --> 00:20:29,655
[SPEAKER_17]: There's a lot of zeros in the world.

161
00:20:29,815 --> 00:20:31,176
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, you're not so echoey anymore.

162
00:20:31,216 --> 00:20:31,956
[SPEAKER_09]: You're echoing away.

163
00:20:31,996 --> 00:20:33,297
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, but I'm still sniffy.

164
00:20:33,637 --> 00:20:33,757
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh.

165
00:20:34,372 --> 00:20:36,273
[SPEAKER_09]: I know, there's been like disease going around.

166
00:20:36,433 --> 00:20:40,515
[SPEAKER_17]: No, it's called, someone decided to clean the upstairs room while I was in it.

167
00:20:40,835 --> 00:20:41,255
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, okay.

168
00:20:42,015 --> 00:20:42,696
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah.

169
00:20:42,756 --> 00:20:44,236
[SPEAKER_09]: And there was like a thick layer of dust?

170
00:20:44,756 --> 00:20:45,797
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, it's pretty bad.

171
00:20:46,157 --> 00:20:46,857
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, well, yeah.

172
00:20:46,917 --> 00:20:49,718
[SPEAKER_17]: It needed doing, I just was upset at the time.

173
00:20:49,738 --> 00:20:51,439
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm scared of moving out of this place.

174
00:20:51,459 --> 00:20:54,240
[SPEAKER_09]: You know the Orange Lounge Radio studio is moving in April.

175
00:20:55,261 --> 00:20:58,722
[SPEAKER_09]: So, hopefully you'll have less of a drive to get to the Orange Lounge studio, Jamie.

176
00:20:59,943 --> 00:21:00,323
[SPEAKER_17]: Hopefully.

177
00:21:00,595 --> 00:21:01,837
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

178
00:21:16,343 --> 00:21:16,723
[SPEAKER_17]: DarkSakura

179
00:21:45,871 --> 00:21:47,791
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't even remember what I did last weekend.

180
00:21:48,392 --> 00:21:49,572
[SPEAKER_17]: I know I had to do something.

181
00:21:50,312 --> 00:21:52,913
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh yeah, it was celebrating Valentine's Day.

182
00:21:53,693 --> 00:21:54,373
[SPEAKER_29]: I'm so bad.

183
00:21:57,373 --> 00:21:59,354
[SPEAKER_29]: Didn't you say the man was listening tonight too?

184
00:21:59,414 --> 00:22:00,434
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, I did.

185
00:22:00,954 --> 00:22:01,314
[SPEAKER_17]: Whoops!

186
00:22:01,334 --> 00:22:02,675
[SPEAKER_17]: Whoops!

187
00:22:02,755 --> 00:22:04,675
[SPEAKER_17]: Seriously though, we went to Claim Jumper for dinner.

188
00:22:05,035 --> 00:22:05,515
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, that's awesome.

189
00:22:05,535 --> 00:22:07,096
[SPEAKER_09]: And ate like everything in sight.

190
00:22:07,196 --> 00:22:07,756
[SPEAKER_09]: That's awesome.

191
00:22:07,956 --> 00:22:09,556
[SPEAKER_17]: And I had chocolate cream cheese pie.

192
00:22:09,576 --> 00:22:11,757
[SPEAKER_09]: I wish I was in a relationship so I could go to Claim Jumper.

193
00:22:11,957 --> 00:22:12,977
[SPEAKER_17]: You can go to Claim Jumper anyway.

194
00:22:13,217 --> 00:22:13,737
[SPEAKER_09]: I know, but.

195
00:22:14,633 --> 00:22:14,973
[SPEAKER_09]: www.DarkSakura.com

196
00:22:45,669 --> 00:22:46,369
[SPEAKER_17]: I was a fool.

197
00:22:46,970 --> 00:22:48,170
[SPEAKER_17]: And they gave me a free cup of soup.

198
00:22:49,230 --> 00:22:53,132
[SPEAKER_17]: Dan got, like, for his appetizer, he got, like, chili in the bread bowl.

199
00:22:53,912 --> 00:22:56,433
[SPEAKER_17]: And I'm sitting here with my little cup of soup going, huh, soup.

200
00:22:57,234 --> 00:22:59,775
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm sitting there staring at his bowl and eating part of it.

201
00:22:59,835 --> 00:23:02,976
[SPEAKER_17]: And it's like, there's no point you should be sitting there staring at his food here.

202
00:23:02,996 --> 00:23:03,476
[SPEAKER_17]: Have another cup.

203
00:23:03,496 --> 00:23:04,877
[SPEAKER_17]: I was like, thank you.

204
00:23:04,977 --> 00:23:05,757
[SPEAKER_17]: You get a good tip.

205
00:23:05,897 --> 00:23:06,517
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, that's nice.

206
00:23:06,897 --> 00:23:10,659
[SPEAKER_09]: Claim Jumper has the best potato cheddar soup in the world.

207
00:23:10,859 --> 00:23:11,739
[SPEAKER_09]: In the world.

208
00:23:11,759 --> 00:23:12,800
[SPEAKER_17]: It has pieces of...

209
00:23:13,803 --> 00:23:16,764
[SPEAKER_17]: of slightly overcooked potato skin in it.

210
00:23:17,325 --> 00:23:17,905
[SPEAKER_17]: So it's crunchy.

211
00:23:18,125 --> 00:23:20,206
[SPEAKER_09]: For those who don't know what Claim Jumper is, because they don't have it everywhere.

212
00:23:20,226 --> 00:23:21,707
[SPEAKER_09]: I think they only have it... I think it's only in California.

213
00:23:21,927 --> 00:23:24,768
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I think it's in other states, too, but mostly on the West Coast.

214
00:23:24,808 --> 00:23:25,268
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not sure.

215
00:23:25,728 --> 00:23:27,369
[SPEAKER_09]: But I know they don't have it everywhere.

216
00:23:27,429 --> 00:23:31,231
[SPEAKER_09]: But basically, it's this giant log cabin-themed restaurant.

217
00:23:31,451 --> 00:23:35,213
[SPEAKER_09]: But the portions are like they kill the buffalo out back and put it on your plate.

218
00:23:35,293 --> 00:23:35,933
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, seriously.

219
00:23:35,953 --> 00:23:37,254
[SPEAKER_09]: That's how big it is.

220
00:23:38,814 --> 00:23:41,335
[SPEAKER_17]: I didn't really do anything too Bimani-related.

221
00:23:41,395 --> 00:23:42,356
[SPEAKER_17]: I played some Silent Hill 3.

222
00:23:43,649 --> 00:23:46,570
[SPEAKER_17]: Silent Hill 4 is sort of, eh, creepy.

223
00:23:47,171 --> 00:23:48,311
[SPEAKER_17]: Just sort of annoying creepy.

224
00:23:49,192 --> 00:23:51,973
[SPEAKER_17]: Silent Hill 3 starts off like shit your pants creepy.

225
00:23:53,253 --> 00:23:55,194
[SPEAKER_09]: I screamed like a girl at one part of Silent Hill 4.

226
00:23:55,755 --> 00:23:57,395
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a different kind of scare, I think.

227
00:23:57,415 --> 00:24:02,438
[SPEAKER_17]: Silent Hill 3, I only got as far as the first part of it, the dream part.

228
00:24:03,698 --> 00:24:09,321
[SPEAKER_17]: But it was like, you know what, the Uzi in that game is so ridiculously not useful.

229
00:24:09,912 --> 00:24:10,993
[SPEAKER_17]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

230
00:24:27,660 --> 00:24:56,626
[SPEAKER_09]: but in Silent Hill you don't have enough ammo to kill everything you have to be all Metal Gear Solid about it and you gotta sneak by zombies and just run like hell but that is so not the way I usually play adventure games I want to explore every little corner I want to kill everything because I might drop something I need but that's not the same mindset you can approach I wasn't spoiling shit stop saying I spoiled anything don't listen to that Sharon anyway Dan bought me roses

231
00:24:57,678 --> 00:25:00,280
[SPEAKER_17]: I came home from work the other day, and there were roses.

232
00:25:00,601 --> 00:25:04,144
[SPEAKER_09]: Wait, now, I believe, and I could find this, too, in an earlier podcast.

233
00:25:04,164 --> 00:25:05,185
[SPEAKER_09]: You said something, too.

234
00:25:05,265 --> 00:25:09,488
[SPEAKER_09]: I remember in one of the podcasts, you said, I don't need roses, not flowery girl shit.

235
00:25:09,528 --> 00:25:10,789
[SPEAKER_09]: My man buys me Silent Hill.

236
00:25:11,310 --> 00:25:16,654
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, I'm really not very, you know, girly-girly when it comes to relationships.

237
00:25:16,674 --> 00:25:19,977
[SPEAKER_17]: But every so often, you know, I want something sweet.

238
00:25:20,057 --> 00:25:24,541
[SPEAKER_17]: You know, I have to have my dose of sugar in the relationship, or else I start, you know...

239
00:25:25,128 --> 00:25:32,090
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm getting lethargic, you know, without something to keep my, I guess, relationship blood sugar up or something.

240
00:25:32,150 --> 00:25:33,471
[SPEAKER_09]: You can't use Splenda for that.

241
00:25:33,591 --> 00:25:34,131
[SPEAKER_17]: No Splenda.

242
00:25:35,071 --> 00:25:42,294
[SPEAKER_17]: So, he came home and gave me this box, this really long box, and I'm thinking, oh, well, it's got like a poster in it or something.

243
00:25:42,894 --> 00:25:45,255
[SPEAKER_17]: And there were, there's a dozen pink roses in it.

244
00:25:45,855 --> 00:25:46,515
[SPEAKER_17]: Aww.

245
00:25:46,775 --> 00:25:47,496
[SPEAKER_17]: Aww, I know.

246
00:25:49,339 --> 00:25:51,520
[SPEAKER_17]: I feel all spoiled and special.

247
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:52,740
[SPEAKER_09]: You are spoiled.

248
00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:53,500
[SPEAKER_09]: That's alright.

249
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:56,881
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

250
00:25:56,981 --> 00:26:00,962
[SPEAKER_09]: If you weren't spoiled, you wouldn't bring that same charm to this show, I don't think.

251
00:26:01,122 --> 00:26:01,582
[SPEAKER_09]: No, you would.

252
00:26:02,102 --> 00:26:02,902
[SPEAKER_09]: You'd be charming either way.

253
00:26:03,062 --> 00:26:03,282
[SPEAKER_16]: Rob.

254
00:26:03,582 --> 00:26:05,483
[SPEAKER_09]: What?

255
00:26:06,583 --> 00:26:06,863
[SPEAKER_09]: Shut up.

256
00:26:08,363 --> 00:26:08,583
[SPEAKER_17]: Rob.

257
00:26:09,383 --> 00:26:10,464
[SPEAKER_17]: Rob.

258
00:26:11,504 --> 00:26:12,224
[SPEAKER_17]: Rob.

259
00:26:13,104 --> 00:26:14,284
[SPEAKER_17]: You can stop shutting up now.

260
00:26:14,444 --> 00:26:14,705
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

261
00:26:14,905 --> 00:26:15,105
[SPEAKER_17]: Hi.

262
00:26:15,265 --> 00:26:15,425
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

263
00:26:17,501 --> 00:26:19,062
[SPEAKER_17]: But that's really it.

264
00:26:19,382 --> 00:26:22,243
[SPEAKER_17]: We've been going through the old system stuff.

265
00:26:22,283 --> 00:26:25,484
[SPEAKER_17]: Dan found my copy of Cotton for the PC Engine Duo.

266
00:26:26,204 --> 00:26:30,526
[SPEAKER_17]: So I have this feeling that tomorrow I'm going to be breaking out the TurboGrafx and playing a lot of Cotton.

267
00:26:31,486 --> 00:26:35,627
[SPEAKER_17]: It came out actually on the Neo Geo Pocket Color in the States, I think.

268
00:26:36,328 --> 00:26:41,009
[SPEAKER_17]: But it's a game where you play as a little witch riding her broom and she's addicted to this candy that makes her throw up.

269
00:26:42,690 --> 00:26:43,170
[SPEAKER_17]: Called Willow.

270
00:26:44,542 --> 00:26:46,563
[SPEAKER_17]: And it's funny in the game she goes, WELO!

271
00:26:49,025 --> 00:26:50,465
[SPEAKER_17]: So anyway, I'm done.

272
00:26:51,406 --> 00:26:51,646
[SPEAKER_16]: Yay.

273
00:26:52,166 --> 00:26:53,387
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, Angel, how was your week?

274
00:26:53,427 --> 00:26:53,847
[SPEAKER_09]: How was your day?

275
00:26:55,508 --> 00:26:57,189
[SPEAKER_16]: Monday was... Monday.

276
00:26:58,070 --> 00:26:58,370
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah.

277
00:26:59,130 --> 00:27:00,391
[SPEAKER_16]: I got chocolate and stuff.

278
00:27:00,471 --> 00:27:00,972
[SPEAKER_16]: Is that new?

279
00:27:01,192 --> 00:27:02,092
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes, that's new.

280
00:27:02,773 --> 00:27:04,033
[SPEAKER_16]: He's pointing at my necklace.

281
00:27:04,293 --> 00:27:06,615
[SPEAKER_09]: Angel's got a heart around her neck.

282
00:27:06,715 --> 00:27:08,016
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a little gold heart.

283
00:27:08,096 --> 00:27:09,396
[SPEAKER_09]: I wonder where that came from.

284
00:27:09,476 --> 00:27:09,857
[SPEAKER_16]: He he.

285
00:27:10,337 --> 00:27:11,338
[SPEAKER_16]: He he, he he.

286
00:27:11,418 --> 00:27:12,558
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, Magus' fault.

287
00:27:12,618 --> 00:27:13,659
[SPEAKER_16]: Alright, it's all good.

288
00:27:14,895 --> 00:27:27,479
[SPEAKER_16]: Um, jeez, I don't remember what really happened this week, aside from that, and then, you know, school and work and stuff, and Rob's looking at his caps and playing with them, eek!

289
00:27:29,459 --> 00:27:32,460
[SPEAKER_16]: Actually, yeah, he's got a couple songs to get now, yay!

290
00:27:33,540 --> 00:27:39,322
[SPEAKER_16]: And, uh, by the way, I drank way too much soda this week for that, so, like, you know?

291
00:27:41,106 --> 00:27:47,489
[SPEAKER_09]: Contrary to popular belief, as much as I like people to do things for me, you don't have to drink all that Pepsi to win me free songs.

292
00:27:47,549 --> 00:27:48,069
[SPEAKER_09]: Seriously.

293
00:27:48,469 --> 00:27:49,369
[SPEAKER_09]: Moderation, honey.

294
00:27:49,429 --> 00:27:50,590
[SPEAKER_09]: It's okay.

295
00:27:50,630 --> 00:27:53,031
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll just take what you have extra.

296
00:27:53,191 --> 00:27:53,671
[SPEAKER_09]: It's all good.

297
00:27:54,411 --> 00:27:55,872
[SPEAKER_16]: Who said it was all regular soda?

298
00:27:57,112 --> 00:27:57,493
[SPEAKER_09]: Still.

299
00:27:57,613 --> 00:27:57,953
[SPEAKER_09]: Still.

300
00:27:58,793 --> 00:27:59,673
[SPEAKER_09]: Water's good, too.

301
00:27:59,754 --> 00:28:01,254
[SPEAKER_09]: You can do the water once in a while.

302
00:28:02,114 --> 00:28:02,555
[SPEAKER_16]: Of course.

303
00:28:03,155 --> 00:28:03,495
[SPEAKER_16]: Anyway.

304
00:28:05,076 --> 00:28:06,656
[SPEAKER_16]: God, not much went on, really.

305
00:28:06,856 --> 00:28:08,577
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean, I played some games, but...

306
00:28:09,238 --> 00:28:09,638
[SPEAKER_16]: Not much.

307
00:28:09,858 --> 00:28:11,259
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh yeah, and then the internet went out.

308
00:28:11,639 --> 00:28:12,019
[SPEAKER_16]: Damn it.

309
00:28:12,359 --> 00:28:13,100
[SPEAKER_16]: Two days later.

310
00:28:14,580 --> 00:28:17,602
[SPEAKER_16]: Two days later and some phone calls.

311
00:28:17,822 --> 00:28:20,743
[SPEAKER_16]: We finally have internet back, so that's good.

312
00:28:22,264 --> 00:28:25,285
[SPEAKER_16]: And I don't know what else happened this week.

313
00:28:26,285 --> 00:28:27,566
[SPEAKER_16]: It just went by way too quick.

314
00:28:30,067 --> 00:28:31,147
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, then I guess you're done.

315
00:28:32,008 --> 00:28:34,829
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, Loki looks like he's cooking, so I guess I'll talk about my week.

316
00:28:35,484 --> 00:28:37,625
[SPEAKER_09]: My Valentine's Day, now I'm the single bitch in here.

317
00:28:38,005 --> 00:28:40,026
[SPEAKER_09]: Everybody else is in a relationship, but I'm the single bitch.

318
00:28:40,247 --> 00:28:40,727
[SPEAKER_09]: That's fine.

319
00:28:41,347 --> 00:28:41,927
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm okay with that.

320
00:28:44,089 --> 00:28:52,393
[SPEAKER_09]: You did, but for Valentine's Day, actually one of my buddies had a little cookover thing.

321
00:28:52,573 --> 00:28:54,794
[SPEAKER_09]: Like he cooked dinner for a bunch of single people.

322
00:28:54,854 --> 00:28:57,356
[SPEAKER_09]: He had like a singles dinner, which I think is really nice.

323
00:28:57,396 --> 00:28:58,276
[SPEAKER_09]: That's a very good idea.

324
00:28:58,456 --> 00:29:00,697
[SPEAKER_09]: That was very nice and very sweet, so I was happy that he did that.

325
00:29:00,717 --> 00:29:03,939
[SPEAKER_09]: So he gave me something to do on Valentine's Day where I didn't feel lonely.

326
00:29:05,259 --> 00:29:12,701
[SPEAKER_09]: And I didn't even have to put out, and I didn't have to buy flowers for anybody, so it was great.

327
00:29:12,782 --> 00:29:14,862
[SPEAKER_09]: So I got steak on Valentine's Day.

328
00:29:15,662 --> 00:29:16,343
[SPEAKER_09]: How great is that?

329
00:29:16,703 --> 00:29:18,163
[SPEAKER_09]: I got homemade steak on Valentine's Day.

330
00:29:18,183 --> 00:29:20,324
[SPEAKER_09]: It's awesome.

331
00:29:20,724 --> 00:29:21,764
[SPEAKER_09]: Because beef is love.

332
00:29:22,365 --> 00:29:23,125
[SPEAKER_09]: Seriously, it is.

333
00:29:25,023 --> 00:29:27,444
[SPEAKER_09]: And no, you perverts, not that kind of meat.

334
00:29:28,945 --> 00:29:29,365
[SPEAKER_09]: Bastards.

335
00:29:30,606 --> 00:29:32,927
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's see, what else did I do this week?

336
00:29:32,967 --> 00:29:37,930
[SPEAKER_09]: I played a lot of WarioWare Touched, because I bought it on the DS on Tuesday, the day it came out.

337
00:29:38,350 --> 00:29:40,731
[SPEAKER_09]: Because, you know, I was all excited for a new WarioWare game.

338
00:29:41,377 --> 00:29:55,362
[SPEAKER_09]: and there was a side of me where I was kind of like what if they do the Nintendo thing and just recycle the same garbage and I have to play the same damn indie games but they're all new and that made me so happy so I'll gush about that more on this week's podcast so definitely check that out if you haven't yet.

339
00:29:56,082 --> 00:29:57,342
[SPEAKER_09]: WarioWare is awesome.

340
00:29:57,963 --> 00:29:58,643
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm very happy with it.

341
00:29:58,883 --> 00:30:01,224
[SPEAKER_09]: There are some downsides to it though so I'll talk about it later.

342
00:30:03,184 --> 00:30:05,445
[SPEAKER_09]: And then I was doing a little bit of retro gaming too as well.

343
00:30:05,625 --> 00:30:07,186
[SPEAKER_09]: I've been playing a little more with the emulator.

344
00:30:07,226 --> 00:30:09,026
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know why I've been getting so back into that lately.

345
00:30:09,486 --> 00:30:10,907
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it's because I've been trying to

346
00:30:12,073 --> 00:30:12,493
[SPEAKER_09]: Final Fantasy XI

347
00:30:33,703 --> 00:30:35,624
[SPEAKER_09]: And I got killed so, so bad.

348
00:30:35,684 --> 00:30:41,309
[SPEAKER_09]: I came in last place, and like seventh place, which is next to last place, had like twice as many kills as I did.

349
00:30:41,589 --> 00:30:42,469
[SPEAKER_09]: That is how sad it was.

350
00:30:43,410 --> 00:30:44,511
[SPEAKER_09]: I was just not meant to play Halo.

351
00:30:44,951 --> 00:30:46,693
[SPEAKER_09]: Or any first person shooter for that matter, I don't think.

352
00:30:48,814 --> 00:30:50,395
[SPEAKER_09]: Otherwise, what did I end up doing in real life?

353
00:30:50,455 --> 00:30:54,899
[SPEAKER_09]: Last night I went out to the casino, and I lost $60.

354
00:30:55,359 --> 00:30:58,041
[SPEAKER_09]: But, you know, that's okay, because I'm going to win it all back next time.

355
00:30:58,061 --> 00:30:58,962
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm going to win it all back.

356
00:31:01,303 --> 00:31:02,144
[SPEAKER_09]: And I went to the buffet.

357
00:31:02,164 --> 00:31:02,244
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

358
00:31:02,574 --> 00:31:03,655
[SPEAKER_09]: Biggest buffets are awesome.

359
00:31:04,655 --> 00:31:14,520
[SPEAKER_09]: And you know, when I went out to lunch with an old friend of mine today, I went out to lunch with Julie today, and she was saying, you know, when people say that they're going to the casino to go to the buffet, that's just code words for gambling.

360
00:31:15,380 --> 00:31:16,621
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'm like, yeah, sadly it is.

361
00:31:16,961 --> 00:31:18,042
[SPEAKER_33]: I go before the buffet.

362
00:31:18,862 --> 00:31:21,003
[SPEAKER_09]: I only gambled a dollar.

363
00:31:22,064 --> 00:31:22,744
[SPEAKER_09]: But you gambled.

364
00:31:23,561 --> 00:31:24,061
[SPEAKER_33]: Thanks for watching!

365
00:31:46,706 --> 00:31:48,687
[SPEAKER_09]: The chat room is saying you suck at gambling.

366
00:31:48,727 --> 00:31:49,668
[SPEAKER_09]: I do suck at gambling.

367
00:31:49,688 --> 00:31:51,008
[SPEAKER_09]: I should stop.

368
00:31:51,068 --> 00:31:51,849
[SPEAKER_09]: I really need to stop.

369
00:31:52,429 --> 00:31:53,510
[SPEAKER_09]: But it's so addicting.

370
00:31:56,871 --> 00:31:57,772
[SPEAKER_09]: Loki, how was your week?

371
00:31:57,812 --> 00:31:58,332
[SPEAKER_09]: How was your day?

372
00:32:01,833 --> 00:32:04,355
[SPEAKER_09]: He's getting his food finished up before he can talk in the microphone here.

373
00:32:05,335 --> 00:32:06,196
[SPEAKER_09]: Is that still on cam?

374
00:32:06,816 --> 00:32:10,077
[SPEAKER_09]: www.orangeloungeradio.com Our amazing Orange Lounge kitchen.

375
00:32:12,018 --> 00:32:12,859
[SPEAKER_09]: Actually, we can't hear you, bud.

376
00:32:12,879 --> 00:32:13,219
[SPEAKER_09]: Turn on the mic.

377
00:32:15,137 --> 00:32:17,879
[SPEAKER_33]: Yes, it has a shot of the empty walk at the moment.

378
00:32:17,999 --> 00:32:18,340
[SPEAKER_33]: Okay.

379
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:19,881
[SPEAKER_33]: Which will be full.

380
00:32:21,583 --> 00:32:23,504
[SPEAKER_33]: Well, had a cold this week.

381
00:32:23,824 --> 00:32:24,425
[SPEAKER_33]: That sucked.

382
00:32:25,726 --> 00:32:26,967
[SPEAKER_33]: Saw Constantine.

383
00:32:26,987 --> 00:32:27,748
[SPEAKER_33]: That was pretty good.

384
00:32:29,329 --> 00:32:30,510
[SPEAKER_33]: Played lots of Final Fantasy.

385
00:32:30,530 --> 00:32:31,431
[SPEAKER_33]: That was pretty cool.

386
00:32:32,352 --> 00:32:38,697
[SPEAKER_33]: And then to top it all off in the final nail in the coffin, my power supply goes out of my computer.

387
00:32:39,017 --> 00:32:39,678
[SPEAKER_33]: That sucked.

388
00:32:41,442 --> 00:33:04,287
[SPEAKER_33]: And, so yeah, so pretty much today was, I was being very lethargic, just like, slept for ten hours, got up, ate some waffles, watched Ghost in the Shell 2 Innocence, I actually watched one of my movies I got, surprisingly enough, and then slept for another three hours, or, I don't even know, slept for an hour or so.

389
00:33:04,307 --> 00:33:06,888
[SPEAKER_33]: And I don't know why.

390
00:33:07,406 --> 00:33:14,811
[SPEAKER_33]: And now because I just realized I haven't had any actual protein in my body for a while, and I kind of feel faint, so I had to cook food.

391
00:33:15,712 --> 00:33:16,892
[SPEAKER_09]: That was my week.

392
00:33:17,793 --> 00:33:18,814
[SPEAKER_09]: When was the last time you ate?

393
00:33:19,774 --> 00:33:21,095
[SPEAKER_09]: This morning, I had waffles.

394
00:33:21,155 --> 00:33:21,836
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh yeah, waffles.

395
00:33:21,976 --> 00:33:22,576
[SPEAKER_09]: But no protein.

396
00:33:23,357 --> 00:33:24,318
[SPEAKER_09]: No protein in waffles.

397
00:33:24,698 --> 00:33:26,699
[SPEAKER_33]: Unfortunately not, there's... Just waffle goodness.

398
00:33:26,959 --> 00:33:29,021
[SPEAKER_33]: Waffle and Aunt Jemima.

399
00:33:31,743 --> 00:33:33,404
[SPEAKER_09]: No protein in Aunt Jemima either.

400
00:33:33,684 --> 00:33:34,524
[SPEAKER_09]: Or her syrup, anyway.

401
00:33:34,885 --> 00:33:35,065
[SPEAKER_33]: No...

402
00:33:35,785 --> 00:33:37,465
[SPEAKER_33]: Her syrup has no protein in it.

403
00:33:38,386 --> 00:33:39,726
[SPEAKER_33]: It's not very tangy either.

404
00:33:40,166 --> 00:33:43,927
[SPEAKER_09]: Aunt Jemima might have protein in her though, but... Anyway.

405
00:33:47,047 --> 00:33:52,709
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, and then we have another person who's knocking on the door, so... It's explicit!

406
00:33:52,729 --> 00:33:55,289
[SPEAKER_33]: You know that knocker's just for decorative purposes, actually.

407
00:33:55,749 --> 00:33:58,710
[SPEAKER_17]: Dude, I just found a neat link on somebody's digital... Alright, I'm done.

408
00:33:58,910 --> 00:33:59,470
[SPEAKER_33]: Tell us about it.

409
00:33:59,590 --> 00:34:00,270
[SPEAKER_33]: Alright, thanks, Loki.

410
00:34:00,330 --> 00:34:02,551
[SPEAKER_17]: The online entomology dictionary.

411
00:34:03,791 --> 00:34:04,291
[SPEAKER_17]: That's pretty cool.

412
00:34:05,242 --> 00:34:10,324
[SPEAKER_17]: and I guess just because I'm the only real nerd here that only I really would find that to be a cool thing.

413
00:34:10,484 --> 00:34:12,044
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, our listeners might be nerdy too.

414
00:34:12,084 --> 00:34:12,524
[SPEAKER_09]: You never know.

415
00:34:12,704 --> 00:34:13,585
[SPEAKER_17]: I'll link it in the chat room.

416
00:34:13,605 --> 00:34:14,045
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

417
00:34:15,645 --> 00:34:18,646
[SPEAKER_09]: Explicit, since you just walked in, why not tell us about your week and your day?

418
00:34:20,427 --> 00:34:21,987
[SPEAKER_32]: This week has been good and bad.

419
00:34:22,007 --> 00:34:25,888
[SPEAKER_32]: I've been busy throughout the whole time doing nothing but homework.

420
00:34:27,028 --> 00:34:31,970
[SPEAKER_32]: Of course, I'm taking like 15 units of class and I have two jobs, so it's pretty hectic.

421
00:34:33,211 --> 00:34:37,674
[SPEAKER_16]: Hey, I heard you ran into Magus this week in the arcade.

422
00:34:39,615 --> 00:34:40,155
[SPEAKER_32]: Uh, what the hell?

423
00:34:43,157 --> 00:34:43,777
[SPEAKER_16]: At school.

424
00:34:46,499 --> 00:34:48,580
[SPEAKER_16]: ARC, you guys are playing Initial D or something?

425
00:34:49,500 --> 00:34:56,564
[SPEAKER_09]: Uh, I don't play Initial D. This Dead Air was brought to you by a DDR Angel story.

426
00:34:57,885 --> 00:34:59,006
[SPEAKER_16]: Hey, that's what I heard.

427
00:34:59,086 --> 00:34:59,586
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean, jeez.

428
00:34:59,606 --> 00:35:00,967
[SPEAKER_32]: We were talking about the future, but not...

429
00:35:02,043 --> 00:35:04,844
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay, whatever.

430
00:35:04,864 --> 00:35:05,325
[SPEAKER_32]: Let's see.

431
00:35:06,105 --> 00:35:08,626
[SPEAKER_32]: I did not get a chance to go to that tournament this Saturday.

432
00:35:08,646 --> 00:35:10,087
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, yeah, that's right.

433
00:35:10,107 --> 00:35:12,648
[SPEAKER_09]: There was another DDR tournament I didn't go to.

434
00:35:12,968 --> 00:35:13,828
[SPEAKER_32]: I heard about it, though.

435
00:35:14,409 --> 00:35:16,289
[SPEAKER_32]: I heard about what happened at the tournament, though.

436
00:35:16,430 --> 00:35:17,310
[SPEAKER_09]: Ooh, what happened, Drama?

437
00:35:18,370 --> 00:35:19,511
[SPEAKER_32]: Well, there's some good and bad stuff.

438
00:35:19,611 --> 00:35:22,872
[SPEAKER_32]: Good was... It was a decent tournament and stuff, as far as I'm hearing.

439
00:35:23,733 --> 00:35:28,635
[SPEAKER_32]: They've actually broadcasted a commercial for March Madness.

440
00:35:29,675 --> 00:35:30,856
[SPEAKER_09]: They did a commercial for...

441
00:35:31,881 --> 00:35:40,169
[SPEAKER_32]: No, they did an intermission to talk about March Madness 2K3 with a combination of Freestyle Revolution Plus.

442
00:35:40,189 --> 00:35:40,730
[SPEAKER_32]: March Madness 2003?

443
00:35:40,890 --> 00:35:41,130
[SPEAKER_32]: 2005, sorry.

444
00:35:41,150 --> 00:35:43,672
[SPEAKER_09]: I think, oh damn, I think we're a couple years late.

445
00:35:47,970 --> 00:35:50,192
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

446
00:36:11,209 --> 00:36:13,990
[SPEAKER_32]: The Manager, Paul, and MilpitasGolfland

447
00:36:28,968 --> 00:36:30,028
[SPEAKER_32]: Screwed the pads over.

448
00:36:31,089 --> 00:36:35,671
[SPEAKER_32]: I heard there's people who are getting 10 misses in a song or 12.

449
00:36:35,991 --> 00:36:38,792
[SPEAKER_32]: There was no full combo throughout the whole tournament.

450
00:36:39,613 --> 00:36:39,953
[SPEAKER_08]: Awesome.

451
00:36:40,113 --> 00:36:43,254
[SPEAKER_32]: That's how bad the freaking pads were.

452
00:36:47,456 --> 00:36:51,198
[SPEAKER_32]: Which also concerns me about March Madness 2K5.

453
00:36:51,858 --> 00:36:53,439
[SPEAKER_32]: If the same result would happen again.

454
00:36:53,699 --> 00:36:55,740
[SPEAKER_09]: Are they going to do DDR Idol and March Madness 2K5?

455
00:36:56,690 --> 00:36:57,230
[SPEAKER_32]: Not this time.

456
00:36:57,871 --> 00:37:00,153
[SPEAKER_32]: We're doing Freestyle Revolution Plus.

457
00:37:00,973 --> 00:37:01,313
[SPEAKER_09]: No.

458
00:37:01,734 --> 00:37:02,074
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey.

459
00:37:02,474 --> 00:37:02,774
[SPEAKER_09]: No.

460
00:37:03,575 --> 00:37:04,176
[SPEAKER_09]: As in Mike.

461
00:37:04,356 --> 00:37:04,616
[SPEAKER_09]: No.

462
00:37:04,936 --> 00:37:05,537
[SPEAKER_09]: You listening?

463
00:37:06,297 --> 00:37:07,418
[SPEAKER_09]: I want DDR Idol.

464
00:37:07,938 --> 00:37:08,279
[SPEAKER_09]: Now.

465
00:37:08,639 --> 00:37:08,979
[SPEAKER_09]: Do it.

466
00:37:09,259 --> 00:37:09,559
[SPEAKER_09]: Do it.

467
00:37:09,820 --> 00:37:10,140
[SPEAKER_09]: Do it.

468
00:37:10,420 --> 00:37:10,600
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

469
00:37:10,620 --> 00:37:11,841
[SPEAKER_32]: I'm not the one organizing it.

470
00:37:11,901 --> 00:37:12,301
[SPEAKER_09]: I know.

471
00:37:12,442 --> 00:37:14,603
[SPEAKER_09]: That's why I was putting out that special message.

472
00:37:14,723 --> 00:37:17,245
[SPEAKER_32]: Or the upcoming Sacramento tournament in April.

473
00:37:18,806 --> 00:37:19,807
[SPEAKER_09]: We need another DDR Idol.

474
00:37:20,828 --> 00:37:21,108
[SPEAKER_32]: Yeah.

475
00:37:21,596 --> 00:37:29,057
[SPEAKER_32]: Oh, speaking of tournament in April, somebody is actually in the process of organizing a tournament at that month in Sacramento.

476
00:37:30,037 --> 00:37:30,698
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's not you?

477
00:37:31,118 --> 00:37:31,378
[SPEAKER_32]: Not me.

478
00:37:31,618 --> 00:37:31,958
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, wow.

479
00:37:32,378 --> 00:37:32,878
[SPEAKER_09]: Who's doing it?

480
00:37:34,938 --> 00:37:36,459
[SPEAKER_32]: A friend of mine named DJ Arrow.

481
00:37:37,079 --> 00:37:38,299
[SPEAKER_32]: He's on the forums.

482
00:37:39,019 --> 00:37:42,540
[SPEAKER_32]: Yeah, he wanted to go through the process of tournament organizing and stuff.

483
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:43,220
[SPEAKER_32]: Good luck!

484
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:44,280
[SPEAKER_32]: Good luck, kid!

485
00:37:44,700 --> 00:37:48,041
[SPEAKER_32]: Have fun!

486
00:37:48,121 --> 00:37:50,221
[SPEAKER_32]: It's not an easy path, but I have faith in him.

487
00:37:51,769 --> 00:37:52,670
[SPEAKER_09]: It's really not easy.

488
00:37:52,790 --> 00:37:56,031
[SPEAKER_09]: If he puts the time and effort into it, it'll be a good tourney.

489
00:37:56,611 --> 00:37:57,071
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't doubt.

490
00:37:59,232 --> 00:38:01,053
[SPEAKER_09]: Remember when we did tourneys, Janie?

491
00:38:01,213 --> 00:38:01,513
[SPEAKER_09]: Janie?

492
00:38:02,213 --> 00:38:02,813
[SPEAKER_09]: I said Janie.

493
00:38:03,234 --> 00:38:03,474
[SPEAKER_17]: Yep.

494
00:38:04,094 --> 00:38:09,696
[SPEAKER_17]: And this is as long as people can accept criticism without taking it personally.

495
00:38:10,156 --> 00:38:10,496
[SPEAKER_32]: Sorry.

496
00:38:10,636 --> 00:38:12,317
[SPEAKER_32]: Well, I know, I know, I know.

497
00:38:12,557 --> 00:38:15,278
[SPEAKER_32]: That was an issue back then, but...

498
00:38:16,092 --> 00:38:17,632
[SPEAKER_17]: That was an issue a few weeks ago.

499
00:38:18,453 --> 00:38:18,973
[SPEAKER_32]: Yeah.

500
00:38:20,833 --> 00:38:23,974
[SPEAKER_32]: But there was a lot of heat and drama.

501
00:38:23,994 --> 00:38:25,815
[SPEAKER_32]: There was so much heat and drama at the time.

502
00:38:26,795 --> 00:38:28,655
[SPEAKER_32]: That I hope does not happen in July.

503
00:38:30,396 --> 00:38:31,396
[SPEAKER_32]: Yeah, I made mistakes.

504
00:38:31,616 --> 00:38:32,837
[SPEAKER_32]: I admit I made mistakes.

505
00:38:32,917 --> 00:38:35,877
[SPEAKER_32]: But I admit my mistakes and learned from it.

506
00:38:36,718 --> 00:38:37,558
[SPEAKER_32]: Hopefully it doesn't happen.

507
00:38:38,498 --> 00:38:41,299
[SPEAKER_09]: Good for you that you can admit that we've all made mistakes.

508
00:38:42,697 --> 00:38:47,078
[SPEAKER_32]: I mean, a lot of things went through tournament organizing itself.

509
00:38:48,158 --> 00:39:00,720
[SPEAKER_32]: There's always going to be a conflict, an unexpected conflict that you may not be able to do because it could be the pad issue, but sometimes the place may restrict you from doing certain things.

510
00:39:02,461 --> 00:39:10,602
[SPEAKER_09]: I say next time there's a clause written into the contract that says, or the gaming thing that says, if the pads break down during the tournament...

511
00:39:11,249 --> 00:39:15,150
[SPEAKER_09]: The tournament will instantly become a whack-a-mole competition, and we'll just all play whack-a-mole.

512
00:39:15,531 --> 00:39:16,831
[SPEAKER_09]: Because whack-a-mole is awesome.

513
00:39:16,891 --> 00:39:21,172
[SPEAKER_32]: Well, if there's really a big bad error on one side, you can try doing it on the other.

514
00:39:23,013 --> 00:39:25,114
[SPEAKER_32]: Unless if both sides are messed up.

515
00:39:25,454 --> 00:39:33,377
[SPEAKER_09]: That's what happened at our first SACTO tourney, is that one of the sides was screwing up, so we ended up having to do PA all on one side.

516
00:39:33,857 --> 00:39:34,277
[SPEAKER_09]: Which, you know...

517
00:39:36,094 --> 00:39:41,019
[SPEAKER_09]: It made things go a little longer, but at the same time, we were on schedule, I think.

518
00:39:41,439 --> 00:39:46,003
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, this was years ago, but I think it ended up being on schedule anyway, so we weren't too bad.

519
00:39:46,324 --> 00:39:48,686
[SPEAKER_09]: But it was just kind of a bummer that that had to happen, you know?

520
00:39:49,287 --> 00:39:50,548
[SPEAKER_32]: I mean, it happens.

521
00:39:51,028 --> 00:39:51,569
[SPEAKER_32]: It happens.

522
00:39:52,329 --> 00:39:56,153
[SPEAKER_32]: But if both pads, like I said, if both pads don't function, then you can't really run a tournament.

523
00:39:57,595 --> 00:39:59,957
[SPEAKER_32]: Or I don't even know what's going to happen right there.

524
00:40:00,796 --> 00:40:04,118
[SPEAKER_09]: What does Milpitas have, like, 50 machines, DDR machines they can use?

525
00:40:04,138 --> 00:40:09,461
[SPEAKER_32]: Unfortunately, it's under Paul or MGL's management, manager itself.

526
00:40:10,742 --> 00:40:17,906
[SPEAKER_32]: I mean, this is what the reason why I'm hearing why they did not switch the pads to inter-groove pads, which is almost in good condition.

527
00:40:18,286 --> 00:40:19,547
[SPEAKER_09]: Unlike anyone plays inter-groove.

528
00:40:20,925 --> 00:40:22,946
[SPEAKER_32]: According to what I'm hearing... Kidding, kidding kids, I'm kidding.

529
00:40:23,886 --> 00:40:28,027
[SPEAKER_32]: According from the sources I'm hearing, Indigroup makes a lot more money than DDR in Milpitas.

530
00:40:28,267 --> 00:40:30,967
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I'm not surprised, because there's no new DDR game.

531
00:40:31,507 --> 00:40:37,209
[SPEAKER_32]: And the fact that they did not use the Indigroup pads for that tournament makes me wonder what happened.

532
00:40:40,529 --> 00:40:47,591
[SPEAKER_32]: I mean, they're extreme in 4th Plus with the messed up pads, so... Right, anyways, let's move on.

533
00:40:47,671 --> 00:40:48,111
[SPEAKER_32]: Sorry if I...

534
00:40:48,843 --> 00:40:49,663
[SPEAKER_09]: No, that's alright.

535
00:40:50,524 --> 00:40:51,464
[SPEAKER_09]: Don't listen to the chatroom.

536
00:40:51,904 --> 00:40:52,684
[SPEAKER_09]: Don't listen to the chatroom.

537
00:40:54,725 --> 00:40:55,205
[SPEAKER_09]: Here you go, Jamie.

538
00:40:55,245 --> 00:40:55,765
[SPEAKER_09]: Here's some Advil.

539
00:40:58,406 --> 00:40:59,527
[SPEAKER_32]: Or you can watch Loki cook.

540
00:41:00,067 --> 00:41:01,788
[SPEAKER_09]: We can learn from tournament drama.

541
00:41:03,608 --> 00:41:04,088
[SPEAKER_32]: Let's see.

542
00:41:04,729 --> 00:41:05,749
[SPEAKER_32]: Is anybody going to E3?

543
00:41:06,549 --> 00:41:07,069
[SPEAKER_09]: I want to.

544
00:41:07,990 --> 00:41:14,932
[SPEAKER_09]: I know that Jamie and Matt are, but I have to do the business stuff for Orange Lounge still, which I need to get up off my ass and do this week.

545
00:41:16,373 --> 00:41:16,933
[SPEAKER_09]: But I want to go.

546
00:41:17,392 --> 00:41:17,632
[SPEAKER_09]: Why?

547
00:41:17,812 --> 00:41:18,352
[SPEAKER_09]: Why are you asking?

548
00:41:18,492 --> 00:41:24,215
[SPEAKER_32]: Nah, I'm just wondering, because I was thinking more like having a group of people going to E3 and stuff, if possible.

549
00:41:25,155 --> 00:41:26,836
[SPEAKER_32]: I'll be at E3, but I'm going with DDR Freak.

550
00:41:27,336 --> 00:41:31,557
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I'll be at E3, but, I mean, I have no, it's too early to plan.

551
00:41:32,498 --> 00:41:33,338
[SPEAKER_32]: Hey, who never knows?

552
00:41:33,558 --> 00:41:34,118
[SPEAKER_32]: You never know.

553
00:41:34,458 --> 00:41:38,500
[SPEAKER_32]: I think, who knows if the tickets will cost more, like, later on, I'm not really sure.

554
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:43,762
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, you can pay to get in if you've got a couple hundred bucks sitting around, but, you know, you're supposed to...

555
00:41:45,017 --> 00:41:47,278
[SPEAKER_09]: Get the hookup by having some game companies.

556
00:41:47,858 --> 00:41:51,499
[SPEAKER_32]: I know places like GameStop, EB, and various other gaming companies.

557
00:41:51,819 --> 00:41:55,800
[SPEAKER_32]: As long as you have access to gaming or any interest of gaming itself.

558
00:41:56,140 --> 00:41:58,941
[SPEAKER_09]: I had friends that went under EB Games and GameStop.

559
00:41:59,001 --> 00:41:59,441
[SPEAKER_09]: I've seen that.

560
00:41:59,821 --> 00:42:01,421
[SPEAKER_32]: I know people too.

561
00:42:03,302 --> 00:42:10,744
[SPEAKER_32]: You can even say that you have a website dedicated to games even though you don't have it.

562
00:42:13,648 --> 00:42:14,989
[SPEAKER_09]: Now, wait a minute, wait a minute.

563
00:42:15,530 --> 00:42:31,281
[SPEAKER_09]: It is kind of hard to get in on a website, trust me, I know from experience, because we have a problem proving Orange Lounge Radio is a legit gaming thing, even though, God, we promote the hell out of certain video games, and our podcast is more popular than what we're doing here right now.

564
00:42:32,222 --> 00:42:38,226
[SPEAKER_09]: So, you know, and it's listened to by quite a few people, but we're still just a hobby, I guess.

565
00:42:40,408 --> 00:42:40,688
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

566
00:42:40,981 --> 00:42:45,165
[SPEAKER_32]: because I know of someone I knew who had a fake website and went into E3 somehow.

567
00:42:46,646 --> 00:42:54,373
[SPEAKER_09]: If you know what to do, I guess it's possible, but I'm not good with that stuff, like bargaining and dealing my way in.

568
00:42:59,037 --> 00:42:59,297
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

569
00:42:59,998 --> 00:43:07,564
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, anyway, what we're going to do is we're going to go to a break, we're going to come back, and then we're going to talk about some more Bomani news, I guess, if we have any to talk about this week.

570
00:43:07,604 --> 00:43:08,245
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll find something.

571
00:43:09,318 --> 00:43:19,003
[SPEAKER_09]: and all your favorite Orange Lounge Radio segments when we come back after this little break featuring another mix of various songs from various CDR mixes.

572
00:43:19,183 --> 00:43:19,683
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll be back.

573
00:43:19,723 --> 00:43:21,244
[SPEAKER_09]: You're listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

574
00:44:09,348 --> 00:44:10,470
Thank you for watching!

575
00:45:54,581 --> 00:45:55,242
Thanks for watching!

576
00:46:52,065 --> 00:46:52,934
Thanks for watching!

577
00:49:05,377 --> 00:49:06,201
Thanks for watching!

578
00:50:00,032 --> 00:50:09,395
[SPEAKER_04]: And now, let's listen in to an Orange Lounge Radio staff meeting as they debate some of the new programming coming to Orange Lounge Radio.

579
00:50:10,118 --> 00:50:14,219
[SPEAKER_09]: Jamie, I have a suggestion about some of the music in our Bomani Music and More program.

580
00:50:14,239 --> 00:50:15,200
[SPEAKER_09]: Can we talk about that?

581
00:50:15,480 --> 00:50:17,820
[SPEAKER_26]: No subject will ever be taboo.

582
00:50:18,121 --> 00:50:21,742
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I was thinking maybe we should move Pump Up the Volume from Tuesday Nights.

583
00:50:22,282 --> 00:50:24,823
[SPEAKER_09]: Except, of course, a subject that was just under discussion.

584
00:50:25,323 --> 00:50:30,664
[SPEAKER_33]: Okay, well, what would you think if maybe we cut back on some of the tack music we play on the station?

585
00:50:31,225 --> 00:50:32,505
[SPEAKER_26]: I collect your fucking head.

586
00:50:34,480 --> 00:50:35,960
[SPEAKER_24]: Just like this fucker here.

587
00:50:38,141 --> 00:50:40,741
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh my god, why did you do that to Loki?

588
00:50:41,041 --> 00:50:44,402
[SPEAKER_10]: The holic thing on episode 69 was just a joke!

589
00:50:45,342 --> 00:50:51,784
[SPEAKER_14]: Now if any of you sons of bitches got anything else to say, now's the fucking time!

590
00:50:52,984 --> 00:50:56,785
[SPEAKER_04]: Orange Lounge Radio, where everybody has a say.

591
00:51:01,726 --> 00:51:03,366
[SPEAKER_09]: Welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio.

592
00:51:04,109 --> 00:51:04,532
[SPEAKER_09]: Episode 132, In Progress

593
00:51:07,028 --> 00:51:11,311
[SPEAKER_09]: We decided during the break that we're going to play some match game tonight, so be ready for that a little later on.

594
00:51:12,131 --> 00:51:14,312
[SPEAKER_09]: We haven't done match game in a little while, so we're going to do that tonight.

595
00:51:15,433 --> 00:51:17,574
[SPEAKER_09]: You will have to be on the Skype line if you want to play.

596
00:51:17,694 --> 00:51:22,817
[SPEAKER_09]: Actually, we always take one person from the Skype line and one person from our chat room that doesn't have Skype.

597
00:51:22,857 --> 00:51:26,459
[SPEAKER_09]: So if you want to sign up to play, just be ready for that.

598
00:51:26,499 --> 00:51:31,082
[SPEAKER_09]: You want more information on getting in on the Skype line, www.orangeandre.com.

599
00:51:31,102 --> 00:51:32,383
[SPEAKER_09]: Click on Interact With Us.

600
00:51:32,423 --> 00:51:35,725
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey, while you're on our website, check out the podcast, which by the way,

601
00:51:37,051 --> 00:51:38,292
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

602
00:52:00,259 --> 00:52:10,443
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, before we get into what's going on with the match game, I thought we could talk about what's going on in the Bomani world, and a little bit of maybe the general gaming world as well.

603
00:52:10,843 --> 00:52:14,304
[SPEAKER_09]: Loki, you heard something about what's going on with DDR.

604
00:52:14,344 --> 00:52:18,546
[SPEAKER_09]: Apparently, there is a new DDR game out in arcades.

605
00:52:19,006 --> 00:52:20,386
[SPEAKER_09]: But don't get excited just yet, kids.

606
00:52:21,127 --> 00:52:22,087
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, it's another bootleg.

607
00:52:23,327 --> 00:52:23,508
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

608
00:52:23,548 --> 00:52:24,988
[SPEAKER_33]: Well, give us some detail.

609
00:52:26,389 --> 00:52:26,629
[SPEAKER_33]: Okay.

610
00:52:27,149 --> 00:52:27,389
[SPEAKER_33]: Well...

611
00:52:29,178 --> 00:52:31,219
[SPEAKER_33]: Coming to a Namco arcade near you.

612
00:52:55,809 --> 00:53:07,051
[SPEAKER_33]: And it's basically a PlayStation 2 inside of cabinet with some special hardware and it's running, I kid you not, the DDR Extreme, the US version.

613
00:53:07,911 --> 00:53:09,311
[SPEAKER_33]: So you've got that running in there.

614
00:53:10,232 --> 00:53:11,712
[SPEAKER_33]: And, well, it sucks.

615
00:53:11,792 --> 00:53:13,452
[SPEAKER_33]: The pads aren't even normal pads.

616
00:53:13,552 --> 00:53:17,693
[SPEAKER_33]: They're just these shitty internet, like the ones you can get off of eBay.

617
00:53:18,613 --> 00:53:19,813
[SPEAKER_33]: So they break really quick.

618
00:53:21,233 --> 00:53:21,834
[SPEAKER_33]: It's just shit.

619
00:53:22,834 --> 00:53:24,314
[SPEAKER_33]: That's all that needs to be said.

620
00:53:26,545 --> 00:53:28,747
[SPEAKER_29]: So basically, is it the same?

621
00:53:29,007 --> 00:53:30,808
[SPEAKER_29]: It's just DDR Extreme on PS2?

622
00:53:30,928 --> 00:53:32,249
[SPEAKER_33]: It's running straight off of PS2.

623
00:53:33,010 --> 00:53:35,672
[SPEAKER_09]: How does that work with the quarters and all the different modes and stuff?

624
00:53:35,692 --> 00:53:36,532
[SPEAKER_33]: You can actually buy stuff.

625
00:53:36,612 --> 00:53:38,794
[SPEAKER_33]: They have them for Dreamcast and stuff like that.

626
00:53:38,814 --> 00:53:43,257
[SPEAKER_33]: You can actually get where it has a whole quarter system and it'll lock the game out.

627
00:53:44,978 --> 00:53:48,321
[SPEAKER_33]: I don't really know how that would work, though, as far as, you know...

628
00:53:51,188 --> 00:53:56,013
[SPEAKER_33]: I think it might have something to do with pushing the start button, and that's how it works.

629
00:53:56,253 --> 00:53:58,015
[SPEAKER_33]: I'm not really sure, to be honest.

630
00:53:58,795 --> 00:53:59,696
[SPEAKER_33]: But I've seen them out there.

631
00:54:00,077 --> 00:54:00,777
[SPEAKER_33]: They do exist.

632
00:54:02,860 --> 00:54:10,227
[SPEAKER_33]: But yeah, there's been pictures circling around the internet, and it's literally a PS2 inside of a cabinet.

633
00:54:12,568 --> 00:54:15,509
[SPEAKER_09]: DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

634
00:54:37,720 --> 00:54:38,581
[SPEAKER_33]: The US version.

635
00:54:38,661 --> 00:54:39,843
[SPEAKER_33]: Does it have the webcam?

636
00:54:39,863 --> 00:54:44,328
[SPEAKER_33]: With the iToy web, you know, iToy type interface.

637
00:54:45,949 --> 00:54:47,451
[SPEAKER_09]: Does it actually have an iToy hooked up?

638
00:54:47,571 --> 00:54:47,671
[SPEAKER_09]: Nope.

639
00:54:47,691 --> 00:54:47,952
[SPEAKER_09]: Nope.

640
00:54:47,972 --> 00:54:49,493
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, that's lame.

641
00:54:49,734 --> 00:54:57,643
[SPEAKER_33]: And the thing is, is I think people are trying, they're trying to push it off as like DDR9th mix or whatever, and it's pretty lame.

642
00:54:59,096 --> 00:55:00,138
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, I found that post.

643
00:55:00,198 --> 00:55:03,463
[SPEAKER_09]: It's over here on AaronInJapan.com if you want to check this out.

644
00:55:03,543 --> 00:55:06,829
[SPEAKER_09]: Threads called Namco once again outdoes itself in stupidity.

645
00:55:07,270 --> 00:55:11,717
[SPEAKER_09]: Posted by Windu, Windo, I think it's supposed to be Windo, D-E-U, 32.

646
00:55:13,550 --> 00:55:15,411
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey kids, it's the new DDR Mix.

647
00:55:15,491 --> 00:55:16,312
[SPEAKER_09]: No, not Mega Mix.

648
00:55:16,392 --> 00:55:17,653
[SPEAKER_09]: No, not even Extreme Plus.

649
00:55:17,713 --> 00:55:23,457
[SPEAKER_09]: This time we're really lower the bar by putting the PS2 US Extreme in the 2A DDR cabinet.

650
00:55:23,497 --> 00:55:25,738
[SPEAKER_09]: Not only that, but we've also changed the pads.

651
00:55:26,038 --> 00:55:32,102
[SPEAKER_09]: They're now Cobalt Flux wannabes, included with sheet metal on metal contact, but with a springy, cushiony feel to them.

652
00:55:32,162 --> 00:55:32,743
[SPEAKER_09]: Now the layout.

653
00:55:33,283 --> 00:55:36,847
[SPEAKER_09]: When you insert a coin, a big ugly number appears at the bottom center of the screen.

654
00:55:36,887 --> 00:55:39,050
[SPEAKER_09]: The thing looks like it came straight out of Atari.

655
00:55:39,610 --> 00:55:43,955
[SPEAKER_09]: Now when you insert enough coins for a credit and press start, you go to the main menu of the game.

656
00:55:44,256 --> 00:55:47,259
[SPEAKER_09]: You can't select anything though, it just goes straight into game mode.

657
00:55:47,699 --> 00:55:52,485
[SPEAKER_09]: Here you have the option of selecting single, versus, or double, regardless of how many credits you put in.

658
00:55:53,237 --> 00:55:59,102
[SPEAKER_09]: If you go to Versus with one credit, you are stuck at the character selection screen until you put another credit to activate the other side.

659
00:55:59,582 --> 00:56:03,705
[SPEAKER_09]: Same goes for Double, only you can actually go into the Song Select screen and pick a song.

660
00:56:04,026 --> 00:56:06,648
[SPEAKER_09]: However, one of the sides will not be active at all.

661
00:56:09,762 --> 00:56:10,723
[SPEAKER_09]: On to the gameplay.

662
00:56:10,963 --> 00:56:15,585
[SPEAKER_09]: If you've ever played DDR Extreme USCS or DDR Festival, you know what to expect.

663
00:56:15,705 --> 00:56:17,647
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyway, you pick the song, but what's this?

664
00:56:18,027 --> 00:56:18,887
[SPEAKER_09]: No mod menu?

665
00:56:19,167 --> 00:56:19,668
[SPEAKER_09]: That's right.

666
00:56:20,028 --> 00:56:22,769
[SPEAKER_09]: No possible way to get into the modifier menu.

667
00:56:23,190 --> 00:56:25,131
[SPEAKER_09]: All you can really do is pick your difficulty.

668
00:56:25,591 --> 00:56:30,093
[SPEAKER_09]: I've noticed, though, messing around, that you can hit the left-right select buttons in place of the left-right arrows.

669
00:56:30,474 --> 00:56:33,275
[SPEAKER_09]: So if an LR jump freeze is coming up, no problem.

670
00:56:33,615 --> 00:56:36,217
[SPEAKER_09]: Step off the pad and hit both the buttons at the same time.

671
00:56:37,011 --> 00:56:42,476
[SPEAKER_09]: I've also noticed that if you're holding a freeze and hit the start button, the freeze drops, even though you're still on the arrow.

672
00:56:43,657 --> 00:56:54,348
[SPEAKER_09]: Also, if you're playing single player, a credit is in the machine, and someone decides to press the other side's start button during song select, then bam, instant verses, also known as the third mix effect.

673
00:56:55,057 --> 00:57:01,278
[SPEAKER_09]: And of course, if you're one song away from completing your set and suddenly decide to play non-stop or challenge, no problem!

674
00:57:01,778 --> 00:57:06,179
[SPEAKER_09]: Remember, in Extreme US Consumer, you can go into non-stop challenge even on your final song.

675
00:57:06,499 --> 00:57:10,820
[SPEAKER_09]: And hey, if you really want to piss people off, go for the 20-song custom-only course.

676
00:57:11,180 --> 00:57:15,101
[SPEAKER_09]: With a possible 22 songs per game, there's no way you can lose!

677
00:57:15,581 --> 00:57:19,402
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, actually, you've already lost if you've put your money into this piece of shit.

678
00:57:19,969 --> 00:57:23,250
[SPEAKER_09]: That post, again, coming from Window32 at AaronInJapan.com.

679
00:57:23,570 --> 00:57:26,110
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you for letting me plagiarize your post without your permission.

680
00:57:26,150 --> 00:57:34,232
[SPEAKER_33]: So, as my theory went, it is pretty much, you know, you have to put in so many credits, and after a while, it will let you use the start button.

681
00:57:34,292 --> 00:57:36,892
[SPEAKER_33]: That's why you can't get into the mods, because the mods use the start button.

682
00:57:37,612 --> 00:57:41,193
[SPEAKER_33]: And, obviously, it's wired for the, you know, select screen stuff.

683
00:57:41,293 --> 00:57:44,774
[SPEAKER_33]: That's why the left and right work on that.

684
00:57:45,834 --> 00:57:47,454
[SPEAKER_33]: So, yeah, it's just a hack job.

685
00:57:48,641 --> 00:57:50,582
[SPEAKER_29]: Refresh my memory here for a little bit.

686
00:57:50,862 --> 00:57:52,403
[SPEAKER_09]: Isn't there some type of disclaimer?

687
00:57:53,924 --> 00:58:01,487
[SPEAKER_09]: When you boot up DDR Extreme US, it says something about, this game is licensed for personal and home use only.

688
00:58:01,747 --> 00:58:02,328
[SPEAKER_09]: Nope.

689
00:58:02,508 --> 00:58:04,108
[SPEAKER_09]: Any, oh, come on.

690
00:58:04,669 --> 00:58:06,249
[SPEAKER_09]: Every game has that type of warning.

691
00:58:06,289 --> 00:58:07,350
[SPEAKER_09]: It's the FBI warning.

692
00:58:07,370 --> 00:58:07,790
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

693
00:58:07,810 --> 00:58:08,511
[SPEAKER_09]: It's on everything.

694
00:58:09,191 --> 00:58:15,654
[SPEAKER_33]: I just know it's licensed for use within the United States or whatever, or North America, however that works.

695
00:58:17,469 --> 00:58:21,450
[SPEAKER_33]: I'm sure I've already sent an email to Konami and I'm sure other people have too.

696
00:58:22,330 --> 00:58:22,750
[SPEAKER_29]: Wait a minute.

697
00:58:23,110 --> 00:58:25,070
[SPEAKER_29]: You sent an email to Konami to tell on them?

698
00:58:25,490 --> 00:58:26,150
[SPEAKER_29]: Did you tell?

699
00:58:26,271 --> 00:58:27,231
[SPEAKER_29]: Are you a tattletale?

700
00:58:27,511 --> 00:58:28,551
[SPEAKER_33]: I just wanted to see what they'd say.

701
00:58:29,211 --> 00:58:29,871
[SPEAKER_29]: Did they reply?

702
00:58:30,431 --> 00:58:30,851
[SPEAKER_33]: Yeah, they did.

703
00:58:31,171 --> 00:58:39,693
[SPEAKER_33]: They said that they were forwarding it to their... Because I did... It was to Konami of Hawaii and they were forwarding it to Konami of America or something.

704
00:58:39,713 --> 00:58:40,313
[SPEAKER_33]: I don't know.

705
00:58:40,333 --> 00:58:42,053
[SPEAKER_33]: Some other Konami division.

706
00:58:42,713 --> 00:58:45,194
[SPEAKER_09]: Because Konami's got like 50 different divisions and we can't tell.

707
00:58:45,214 --> 00:58:46,114
[SPEAKER_09]: They're all Konami to us.

708
00:58:46,594 --> 00:58:46,774
[SPEAKER_33]: Yeah.

709
00:58:47,857 --> 00:58:49,138
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, interesting.

710
00:58:50,700 --> 00:58:54,383
[SPEAKER_33]: This is the same day that I also wrote the email to Pia.

711
00:58:55,785 --> 00:58:57,446
[SPEAKER_09]: Loki's been a big tattletale this week.

712
00:58:57,486 --> 00:58:59,909
[SPEAKER_09]: What is that website, Savetoby.com?

713
00:59:01,090 --> 00:59:03,292
[SPEAKER_09]: There's this website where they're threatening to kill a bunny.

714
00:59:04,008 --> 00:59:08,771
[SPEAKER_09]: And I was joking in Loki's live journal, I said, ha ha, you should send that to PETA, I bet they'd have a field day with it.

715
00:59:08,831 --> 00:59:09,512
[SPEAKER_09]: So he did!

716
00:59:09,952 --> 00:59:17,357
[SPEAKER_09]: He sent it to them, and they wrote back this huge old email that said, people like to play pranks on the internet, and that's just sick.

717
00:59:17,437 --> 00:59:18,338
[SPEAKER_09]: I thought it was funny.

718
00:59:18,858 --> 00:59:19,659
[SPEAKER_33]: I hate PETA.

719
00:59:20,339 --> 00:59:25,222
[SPEAKER_33]: I so hate them, but I just wanted to see that website get shut down, because he's making lots of money.

720
00:59:26,904 --> 00:59:28,505
[SPEAKER_09]: Like 15 grand off of it so far.

721
00:59:29,345 --> 00:59:30,486
[SPEAKER_09]: Explicit, your thoughts on this?

722
00:59:36,005 --> 00:59:41,570
[SPEAKER_09]: What the fuck?

723
00:59:41,830 --> 00:59:50,718
[SPEAKER_32]: First we have the 20% speed up DDR Extreme Plus, and now we have this type of crap that doesn't even work at all.

724
00:59:54,321 --> 00:59:59,806
[SPEAKER_09]: But, oh my gods, you can play Go West in the arcade and everything, and your reign.

725
00:59:59,826 --> 01:00:01,928
[SPEAKER_32]: But the sides don't work, so what's the point?

726
01:00:04,435 --> 01:00:07,240
[SPEAKER_32]: The pads are going to be broken within the next day.

727
01:00:07,861 --> 01:00:09,725
[SPEAKER_32]: Would there be an actual point of playing the game?

728
01:00:14,874 --> 01:00:17,158
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, it looks like... Actually, I'm getting a private message from...

729
01:00:18,243 --> 01:00:25,726
[SPEAKER_09]: One of our buddies in chat, and he's actually sending me a link to a picture that shows you can actually get the modifiers in this crappy game.

730
01:00:26,106 --> 01:00:27,346
[SPEAKER_09]: Let me post this picture.

731
01:00:27,446 --> 01:00:30,087
[SPEAKER_09]: I hope they don't mind, but I'm going to post it in our chat room.

732
01:00:30,587 --> 01:00:31,628
[SPEAKER_09]: And so you can take a look at that.

733
01:00:31,668 --> 01:00:33,849
[SPEAKER_09]: You actually can access the modifiers in this somehow.

734
01:00:33,869 --> 01:00:35,029
[SPEAKER_09]: It looks like somebody figured it out.

735
01:00:35,689 --> 01:00:36,630
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, you know how they did it?

736
01:00:37,030 --> 01:00:39,330
[SPEAKER_33]: They said they stomped on a bunch of the buttons.

737
01:00:41,171 --> 01:00:42,412
[SPEAKER_33]: That's honestly what they did.

738
01:00:42,932 --> 01:00:44,992
[SPEAKER_09]: Up, up, down, down, left, right, left, right, maybe?

739
01:00:45,573 --> 01:00:46,373
[SPEAKER_33]: No, I don't know.

740
01:00:46,846 --> 01:00:48,908
[SPEAKER_33]: But they have some videos.

741
01:00:49,428 --> 01:00:55,953
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe what they're trying to do is just inspire the... They're getting their inspiration from the old mixes of DDR.

742
01:00:56,073 --> 01:00:58,835
[SPEAKER_33]: Remember back when kids... They're trying to make a buck off Namco.

743
01:00:58,975 --> 01:01:05,880
[SPEAKER_33]: Honestly, I could take a shit in a box, put it in a DDR cabinet and sell it to Namco and they'd fucking buy it because they're retarded.

744
01:01:09,062 --> 01:01:09,743
[SPEAKER_29]: No left down...

745
01:01:10,248 --> 01:01:12,250
[SPEAKER_29]: Remember when left, down, right, down, left was little?

746
01:01:12,490 --> 01:01:12,810
[SPEAKER_29]: Little!

747
01:01:13,271 --> 01:01:19,956
[SPEAKER_33]: You know, honestly, um, I should, you know, just create some stupid mix right now of Step Mania and Cellotome.

748
01:01:20,417 --> 01:01:21,117
[SPEAKER_33]: I can make money.

749
01:01:21,918 --> 01:01:22,558
[SPEAKER_33]: They're gonna buy it.

750
01:01:23,379 --> 01:01:25,661
[SPEAKER_33]: I'll say, it's DDR9th mix.

751
01:01:25,801 --> 01:01:31,265
[SPEAKER_09]: And wouldn't that be ironic if Konami came after you because somebody tattled on you just like you tattled on these guys?

752
01:01:31,285 --> 01:01:34,268
[SPEAKER_33]: Well, obviously they haven't come after these people since they keep making them.

753
01:01:36,950 --> 01:01:37,631
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, explicit.

754
01:01:37,851 --> 01:01:39,012
[SPEAKER_09]: Speaking of selling a Step Mania.

755
01:01:39,500 --> 01:01:49,943
[SPEAKER_32]: Speaking of that, does anybody remember about some guy in eBay selling an actual bootlegged CD of Step Mania and saying DDR Complete?

756
01:01:51,183 --> 01:01:52,404
[SPEAKER_33]: You can sell Step Mania.

757
01:01:52,844 --> 01:01:53,204
[SPEAKER_33]: You can.

758
01:01:53,264 --> 01:01:54,484
[SPEAKER_33]: It's in the license agreement.

759
01:01:54,504 --> 01:01:55,885
[SPEAKER_33]: You just can't include songs with it.

760
01:01:57,905 --> 01:02:00,486
[SPEAKER_32]: Yeah, and one of the songs says banner.png.

761
01:02:02,727 --> 01:02:06,968
[SPEAKER_32]: Our first, second, third, fourth, fifth, and et cetera, et cetera.

762
01:02:07,890 --> 01:02:09,811
[SPEAKER_09]: So what happened with this on eBay?

763
01:02:10,271 --> 01:02:11,212
[SPEAKER_09]: Did something happen?

764
01:02:11,432 --> 01:02:12,392
[SPEAKER_32]: Six people bought it.

765
01:02:12,892 --> 01:02:14,173
[SPEAKER_32]: Six people actually bought it.

766
01:02:15,413 --> 01:02:16,314
[SPEAKER_32]: For ten bucks.

767
01:02:18,175 --> 01:02:20,496
[SPEAKER_09]: The average Joe gamer doesn't know though.

768
01:02:20,516 --> 01:02:28,139
[SPEAKER_09]: The average parent that sees DDR on Good Morning America and wants to get it for their kids doesn't know crap about it.

769
01:02:28,359 --> 01:02:30,300
[SPEAKER_09]: These people are just preying off the week.

770
01:02:31,044 --> 01:02:35,167
[SPEAKER_32]: Okay, it does not include any of the MP3s.

771
01:02:36,007 --> 01:02:47,194
[SPEAKER_32]: Two, the way everything is organized in terms of folder-wise, you get Hides Off You in 6th, 7th, and 8th mix, so you have duplicates of the same song.

772
01:02:47,775 --> 01:02:53,938
[SPEAKER_09]: It's like those 64-in-1 Taiwanese bootlegs that you used to be able to get for the NES.

773
01:02:54,519 --> 01:02:56,120
[SPEAKER_32]: Exactly, just like those.

774
01:02:56,673 --> 01:03:00,500
[SPEAKER_09]: Where it would have Contra in it eight times, but maybe the player was a different color.

775
01:03:00,860 --> 01:03:03,505
[SPEAKER_09]: I bought that for my friend for Christmas.

776
01:03:08,396 --> 01:03:10,137
[SPEAKER_09]: Where the zapper gun looked like a normal gun.

777
01:03:11,838 --> 01:03:20,521
[SPEAKER_33]: And the controller was an old Nintendo 64 controller that had the analog stick glued in there.

778
01:03:20,801 --> 01:03:27,403
[SPEAKER_33]: And then the other controller was a Genesis controller that they wired up.

779
01:03:29,667 --> 01:03:36,171
[SPEAKER_33]: It's funny, because after Christmas or whatever, they never came back to their kiosk in the mall.

780
01:03:36,211 --> 01:03:36,652
[SPEAKER_09]: They're gone.

781
01:03:37,672 --> 01:03:40,254
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm surprised people don't put this show up on eBay.

782
01:03:42,636 --> 01:03:43,456
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll sue your ass.

783
01:03:44,857 --> 01:03:48,860
[SPEAKER_09]: No, we won't.

784
01:03:48,880 --> 01:03:51,362
[SPEAKER_09]: We should put copies of this show on eBay and see what happens.

785
01:03:52,162 --> 01:03:52,763
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm going to buy them.

786
01:03:52,783 --> 01:03:53,483
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyway.

787
01:03:54,444 --> 01:03:54,724
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyway.

788
01:03:56,630 --> 01:03:59,632
[SPEAKER_09]: Of course, we're probably violating all sorts of copyright laws by doing that, but hey.

789
01:04:01,593 --> 01:04:01,913
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright.

790
01:04:02,313 --> 01:04:04,294
[SPEAKER_09]: What's going on in the sim scene right now, Loki?

791
01:04:04,334 --> 01:04:05,455
[SPEAKER_09]: Anything going on in the sim scene?

792
01:04:06,536 --> 01:04:07,716
[SPEAKER_09]: Even though all the sites are down?

793
01:04:09,597 --> 01:04:11,298
[SPEAKER_09]: Um... No.

794
01:04:14,500 --> 01:04:16,541
[SPEAKER_33]: Really, I don't think there's anything going on.

795
01:04:18,062 --> 01:04:20,664
[SPEAKER_33]: I can't confirm that since my computer's broken, but...

796
01:04:22,919 --> 01:04:23,319
[SPEAKER_33]: MaxVagina

797
01:04:51,218 --> 01:04:52,779
[SPEAKER_09]: On that note, I think we're going to go to another break.

798
01:04:52,799 --> 01:04:55,580
[SPEAKER_09]: When we come back, boys and girls, we're going to get into tonight's match game.

799
01:04:56,401 --> 01:04:56,781
[SPEAKER_09]: Yay.

800
01:04:58,282 --> 01:05:05,686
[SPEAKER_09]: And after the match game, we're going to do the cage match and all those other segments you've come to know and love here on Orange Lounge Radio.

801
01:05:05,706 --> 01:05:07,067
[SPEAKER_09]: So we will be back after this.

802
01:05:07,667 --> 01:05:15,871
[SPEAKER_09]: In this break, hmm, how about we're going to do some Smile DK to start it off because we haven't played Smile DK in a while.

803
01:05:16,171 --> 01:05:17,172
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll be back after this.

804
01:05:20,685 --> 01:05:21,547
[SPEAKER_21]: Thanks for watching!

805
01:06:42,682 --> 01:06:43,422
Stand by your friends!

806
01:06:43,462 --> 01:06:43,582
Wow!

807
01:07:10,825 --> 01:07:13,286
[SPEAKER_21]: Stand by your friends who's wild!

808
01:07:14,726 --> 01:07:17,327
[SPEAKER_21]: Stand by your friends who's wild!

809
01:07:18,728 --> 01:07:21,448
Stand by your friends who's wild!

810
01:07:43,708 --> 01:07:44,689
Thank you for watching!

811
01:08:25,069 --> 01:08:30,971
[SPEAKER_02]: Boob, boob, boob, boob, boob, boob, boob, boob, boob, boob, boob, boob, boob, boob, boob

812
01:08:46,078 --> 01:08:47,098
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you for watching!

813
01:09:20,144 --> 01:09:34,473
I, I, I, I, I, boom, boom, boom, boom Y, I, I, I, boom, boom, boom, boom And all the bottom more time Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom

814
01:09:48,567 --> 01:09:49,707
Thank you for watching!

815
01:10:15,317 --> 01:10:16,099
[SPEAKER_21]: Thanks for watching!

816
01:11:18,940 --> 01:11:19,741
Thank you for watching!

817
01:11:38,021 --> 01:11:46,593
[SPEAKER_10]: Hiho, Kermit the Frog here, informing you that today's broadcast of Orange Lounge Radio is brought to you by the letter V, the letter A, and the number 59.

818
01:11:46,633 --> 01:11:52,180
[SPEAKER_21]: Can you tell me how to get, how to get to Sesame Street?

819
01:11:55,831 --> 01:11:57,032
[SPEAKER_09]: I actually have a prize for our winner tonight.

820
01:11:57,052 --> 01:11:58,093
[SPEAKER_09]: Not with me, but I will send it to them.

821
01:12:26,442 --> 01:12:28,564
[SPEAKER_17]: I have a Resident Evil 4 music sampler.

822
01:12:29,244 --> 01:12:30,004
[SPEAKER_09]: Very cool!

823
01:12:30,144 --> 01:12:31,365
[SPEAKER_09]: An actual prize!

824
01:12:32,245 --> 01:12:36,008
[SPEAKER_17]: And I have an ESPN Sports one, too, if they want a whole pack of them.

825
01:12:36,228 --> 01:12:42,411
[SPEAKER_09]: So tonight, you don't get hung up on if you win, or you get your window closed, I suppose, if you're the chatroom contestant.

826
01:12:42,771 --> 01:12:44,372
[SPEAKER_09]: You win an actual prize!

827
01:12:44,512 --> 01:12:44,832
[SPEAKER_09]: Amazing!

828
01:12:44,892 --> 01:12:48,034
[SPEAKER_09]: Also, the winner, going to the winner, will be the company Ubisoft.

829
01:12:55,216 --> 01:12:56,177
[SPEAKER_09]: Wow, okay.

830
01:12:58,337 --> 01:12:58,617
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

831
01:12:59,737 --> 01:13:00,298
[SPEAKER_09]: That's awesome.

832
01:13:01,058 --> 01:13:10,440
[SPEAKER_09]: I have to see if I... I don't have my match game theme music anymore, and I don't have Loki's computer to leech it from, so I suppose we'll have to fill in with our listless music tonight.

833
01:13:10,460 --> 01:13:14,001
[SPEAKER_09]: Or I could just cough in the microphone.

834
01:13:14,661 --> 01:13:16,582
[SPEAKER_09]: That would be a lovely way to do it.

835
01:13:16,622 --> 01:13:16,922
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

836
01:13:17,793 --> 01:13:21,035
[SPEAKER_09]: How about we just play Genocide and that'll be the match game music?

837
01:13:21,055 --> 01:13:21,255
[SPEAKER_33]: Awesome.

838
01:13:21,275 --> 01:13:21,896
[SPEAKER_33]: How is Resident Evil 4?

839
01:13:21,936 --> 01:13:23,016
[SPEAKER_09]: I haven't really played it yet.

840
01:13:47,307 --> 01:13:48,067
[SPEAKER_32]: I haven't really played it yet.

841
01:13:48,127 --> 01:13:49,908
[SPEAKER_09]: I've seen it, and it looks very rad.

842
01:13:49,988 --> 01:13:50,968
[SPEAKER_32]: It's very good.

843
01:13:50,988 --> 01:13:57,551
[SPEAKER_32]: It's practically, if you're one of the casual games, it's probably one of the best, or by far the best Resident Evil out there.

844
01:14:00,692 --> 01:14:03,733
[SPEAKER_33]: Wow, more dogs jumping through windows than you can ever imagine.

845
01:14:06,955 --> 01:14:12,757
[SPEAKER_32]: I mean, it's like an actual 3D game, rather than just a side, like a camera view that was in 1, 2, and 3.

846
01:14:12,797 --> 01:14:15,858
[SPEAKER_32]: You actually get to see everything.

847
01:14:19,284 --> 01:14:20,624
[SPEAKER_09]: Nobody's calling in right now.

848
01:14:22,245 --> 01:14:23,725
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, what the mobasses?

849
01:14:24,265 --> 01:14:31,926
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, you know, we got that buffer, so it kind of makes things difficult, because we have a slight delay between the time I say, call now, and the time that they actually hear me say, call now.

850
01:14:32,666 --> 01:14:34,247
[SPEAKER_09]: So.

851
01:14:36,307 --> 01:14:36,587
[SPEAKER_09]: So.

852
01:14:38,007 --> 01:14:42,908
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, you know what else is interesting is that a lot of our regulars who call in on the skypline are not here tonight, which is kind of weird.

853
01:14:43,888 --> 01:14:45,249
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know, what is going on tonight?

854
01:14:45,289 --> 01:14:46,509
[SPEAKER_09]: What makes tonight so special?

855
01:14:48,991 --> 01:14:49,552
[SPEAKER_17]: 3 Day Weekend.

856
01:14:51,374 --> 01:14:52,996
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, I don't have a 3 Day Weekend.

857
01:14:53,637 --> 01:14:54,718
[SPEAKER_09]: Why do these people get a 3 Day Weekend?

858
01:14:54,738 --> 01:14:56,020
[SPEAKER_17]: Some of us work for a bank.

859
01:14:56,541 --> 01:14:57,962
[SPEAKER_17]: Guess who doesn't have to work tomorrow?

860
01:15:08,610 --> 01:15:09,791
[SPEAKER_09]: That didn't really work.

861
01:15:09,851 --> 01:15:10,351
[SPEAKER_09]: Wow.

862
01:15:11,172 --> 01:15:14,313
[SPEAKER_09]: You'd think by giving away a prize we'd have more people calling in.

863
01:15:14,353 --> 01:15:15,194
[SPEAKER_09]: Fuck the Skype line.

864
01:15:15,214 --> 01:15:16,935
[SPEAKER_09]: Just have them do it through the chat room.

865
01:15:16,975 --> 01:15:20,857
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, we have people that are in chat going, Oh, I've played before so I can't play again.

866
01:15:21,157 --> 01:15:22,198
[SPEAKER_09]: Sure you can play again.

867
01:15:23,199 --> 01:15:23,799
[SPEAKER_09]: Who cares?

868
01:15:25,740 --> 01:15:27,841
[SPEAKER_09]: We actually have a prize to give away tonight.

869
01:15:28,142 --> 01:15:29,482
[SPEAKER_09]: That makes everybody eligible.

870
01:15:31,904 --> 01:15:32,164
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyway.

871
01:15:32,754 --> 01:15:44,500
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, if nobody calls in the first week, because I know we've got a ton of people who are in chat, because we have quite a few people in chat tonight, but they just aren't on the Skype line, because, you know, you have to download Skype, and then you have to set it up, and da-da-da-da-da.

872
01:15:58,528 --> 01:15:59,629
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll just sit here and wait.

873
01:16:00,069 --> 01:16:01,770
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll just sit here for the next two hours.

874
01:16:02,555 --> 01:16:03,496
[SPEAKER_10]: And I'll just wait!

875
01:16:04,676 --> 01:16:05,437
[SPEAKER_10]: We can do that!

876
01:16:06,638 --> 01:16:08,019
[SPEAKER_10]: Tick-tock, tick-tock!

877
01:16:11,721 --> 01:16:12,301
[SPEAKER_09]: Wow.

878
01:16:12,802 --> 01:16:14,363
[SPEAKER_09]: How stupid do we look right now?

879
01:16:14,383 --> 01:16:21,087
[SPEAKER_33]: I see Paris Hilton's gonna be in a new horror movie coming up, and it's called The Wax House.

880
01:16:21,888 --> 01:16:22,968
[SPEAKER_33]: It looks decent.

881
01:16:22,988 --> 01:16:26,150
[SPEAKER_33]: Except Paris Hilton's in it, and she doesn't get naked, probably.

882
01:16:26,511 --> 01:16:30,193
[SPEAKER_16]: I have something to add to that, that you could probably make fun of.

883
01:16:32,287 --> 01:16:33,987
[SPEAKER_16]: I heard her sidekick got hacked.

884
01:16:34,728 --> 01:16:36,548
[SPEAKER_16]: Her T-Mobile sidekick got hacked.

885
01:16:37,588 --> 01:16:38,328
[SPEAKER_09]: How does that work?

886
01:16:39,208 --> 01:16:45,490
[SPEAKER_09]: We will be doing Paris Hilton chat until somebody calls in the Skype line, so I suggest somebody start downloading it.

887
01:16:45,670 --> 01:16:47,110
[SPEAKER_17]: Fucking call already.

888
01:16:48,330 --> 01:16:52,771
[SPEAKER_33]: She did all Skype in if I... No, wait, no, I can't because my computer's down.

889
01:16:54,431 --> 01:16:56,472
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh my god, you guys, did you see The Simple Life this week?

890
01:16:56,512 --> 01:16:57,632
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh my god, it was so funny.

891
01:16:58,137 --> 01:17:00,959
[SPEAKER_09]: You guys, Paris Hilton was so funny on The Civil Life this week.

892
01:17:01,380 --> 01:17:04,282
[SPEAKER_09]: You know that one part when she said, That's hot?

893
01:17:04,302 --> 01:17:05,803
[SPEAKER_09]: That was so hot.

894
01:17:05,843 --> 01:17:07,004
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh my god, I love The Civil Life.

895
01:17:07,024 --> 01:17:08,745
[SPEAKER_33]: And she was working at a morgue I hear.

896
01:17:09,005 --> 01:17:12,208
[SPEAKER_33]: And with her and the dead bodies, and that was so creepy.

897
01:17:12,748 --> 01:17:13,669
[SPEAKER_33]: Like, oh my god.

898
01:17:14,450 --> 01:17:16,311
[SPEAKER_17]: And then she totally needed to have a makeover.

899
01:17:16,411 --> 01:17:17,852
[SPEAKER_33]: She's like so my idol.

900
01:17:18,633 --> 01:17:20,934
[SPEAKER_33]: Like, I just want to be her one of these days.

901
01:17:21,215 --> 01:17:23,997
[SPEAKER_33]: I wish I could be so rich and have all those clothes and the shoes.

902
01:17:24,597 --> 01:17:25,318
[SPEAKER_33]: Oh my gods.

903
01:17:34,716 --> 01:17:36,336
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, sorry, my mic was off for a minute there.

904
01:17:36,797 --> 01:17:49,659
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh my god, you guys, did you see that episode where they were at the airport and they had to be the airport people and they were like waving and it looked like they were dancing and they were just playing around and then they had to empty the poo out of the plane as punishment.

905
01:17:49,699 --> 01:17:50,720
[SPEAKER_09]: It was so funny.

906
01:17:50,740 --> 01:17:52,960
[SPEAKER_09]: And Paris Hilton was so funny.

907
01:17:53,880 --> 01:18:00,322
[SPEAKER_33]: And then the poo fell on them and then she's like, wow, I haven't done this since last year.

908
01:18:03,457 --> 01:18:05,678
[SPEAKER_33]: Usually they pay extra the shit on me.

909
01:18:12,903 --> 01:18:17,225
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry, I was just about to spit seven up through my nose there.

910
01:18:17,245 --> 01:18:24,149
[SPEAKER_33]: Then that one time where she was working at a fast food joint, and she's like, wow, there's more cock in here than I've ever seen.

911
01:18:25,830 --> 01:18:28,632
[SPEAKER_33]: And it was funny because it's... Oh, we're getting a call, we're getting a call.

912
01:18:30,133 --> 01:18:31,774
[SPEAKER_09]: Hi, here on Orange Lounge Radio.

913
01:18:33,168 --> 01:18:34,408
[SPEAKER_09]: Yo, Sky, Siggy here.

914
01:18:34,608 --> 01:18:36,569
[SPEAKER_09]: Hi, Siggy.

915
01:18:37,409 --> 01:18:41,970
[SPEAKER_09]: You have saved everybody from Paris Hilton chat, and now we can finally play match game.

916
01:18:46,351 --> 01:18:47,051
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

917
01:18:49,252 --> 01:18:50,492
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, great.

918
01:18:50,712 --> 01:18:51,192
[SPEAKER_10]: Go figure.

919
01:18:51,452 --> 01:18:54,213
[SPEAKER_10]: Now the Skype line is lighting up with calls.

920
01:18:54,293 --> 01:18:57,594
[SPEAKER_10]: I've got like four people hammering in all at once now.

921
01:18:59,028 --> 01:19:01,750
[SPEAKER_09]: You ever hear that saying, you snooze, you lose?

922
01:19:01,850 --> 01:19:02,731
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, apply it.

923
01:19:05,333 --> 01:19:10,297
[SPEAKER_17]: You automatically win my eternal gratefulness.

924
01:19:11,078 --> 01:19:13,660
[SPEAKER_17]: You have my gratitude forever.

925
01:19:14,260 --> 01:19:15,501
[SPEAKER_17]: And the ferret loves you, too.

926
01:19:17,363 --> 01:19:18,504
[SPEAKER_30]: And I love the ferrets, too.

927
01:19:18,564 --> 01:19:18,984
[SPEAKER_30]: Thank you.

928
01:19:23,347 --> 01:19:24,268
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, finally.

929
01:19:24,308 --> 01:19:26,310
[SPEAKER_09]: You want to know who you're playing against tonight, Siggy?

930
01:19:28,115 --> 01:19:31,658
[SPEAKER_09]: Now you're playing for Resident Evil 4 sampler CD.

931
01:19:31,758 --> 01:19:32,478
[SPEAKER_09]: Isn't that exciting?

932
01:19:33,399 --> 01:19:35,060
[SPEAKER_30]: Even though I don't play Silent Hill 4.

933
01:19:35,701 --> 01:19:37,622
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, it's Resident Evil 4, so that's alright.

934
01:19:39,724 --> 01:19:42,886
[SPEAKER_17]: There's no way in hell I'm ever getting rid of my Silent Hill 4 sampler.

935
01:19:45,008 --> 01:19:45,688
[SPEAKER_22]: Oh, whatever.

936
01:19:46,108 --> 01:19:47,650
[SPEAKER_22]: I think you just lost right there.

937
01:19:48,490 --> 01:19:50,011
[SPEAKER_22]: I am lost.

938
01:19:50,031 --> 01:19:50,592
[SPEAKER_22]: Alright.

939
01:19:51,833 --> 01:19:52,113
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright.

940
01:19:55,880 --> 01:19:56,221
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

941
01:19:56,841 --> 01:20:00,805
[SPEAKER_09]: You're going to play against MPQ in our chat room tonight.

942
01:20:01,065 --> 01:20:01,526
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

943
01:20:01,726 --> 01:20:02,807
[SPEAKER_09]: MPQ is going to bring it.

944
01:20:02,867 --> 01:20:04,669
[SPEAKER_09]: He was the guy who got our trivia question right.

945
01:20:05,089 --> 01:20:05,330
[SPEAKER_09]: Wait.

946
01:20:05,350 --> 01:20:05,630
[SPEAKER_09]: Hold on.

947
01:20:05,670 --> 01:20:05,910
[SPEAKER_09]: Hold on.

948
01:20:05,950 --> 01:20:06,131
[SPEAKER_09]: Hold on.

949
01:20:07,091 --> 01:20:07,292
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

950
01:20:07,332 --> 01:20:07,732
[SPEAKER_09]: I feel better.

951
01:20:07,792 --> 01:20:08,072
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

952
01:20:09,434 --> 01:20:14,339
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's get into tonight's match game.

953
01:20:14,639 --> 01:20:15,900
[SPEAKER_09]: You know how the match game works, right?

954
01:20:16,421 --> 01:20:16,621
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

955
01:20:16,881 --> 01:20:17,142
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

956
01:20:17,262 --> 01:20:18,483
[SPEAKER_09]: We're going to ask you a question.

957
01:20:19,898 --> 01:20:20,858
[SPEAKER_09]: And it has a blank in it.

958
01:20:21,278 --> 01:20:28,340
[SPEAKER_09]: And then your job is to fill in the blank, and for every celebrity in the chatroom, or I'm sorry, every celebrity in the studio that you match, you get a point.

959
01:20:28,680 --> 01:20:32,241
[SPEAKER_09]: Now here's the thing, I'm going to be asking for an answer from MPQ as well.

960
01:20:32,621 --> 01:20:35,261
[SPEAKER_09]: And for every answer that he matches, he gets a point.

961
01:20:35,502 --> 01:20:38,082
[SPEAKER_09]: And he might walk away with that Resident Evil 4 sampler.

962
01:20:38,962 --> 01:20:44,063
[SPEAKER_09]: So, don't let him do that, or you'll never understand the difference between Resident Evil and Silent Hill.

963
01:20:44,684 --> 01:20:45,004
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright?

964
01:20:47,643 --> 01:20:49,704
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, repeat after me, Siggy.

965
01:20:50,184 --> 01:20:51,164
[SPEAKER_09]: Resident Evil.

966
01:20:51,484 --> 01:20:52,865
[SPEAKER_22]: Resident Evil, yeah, I got it.

967
01:20:52,885 --> 01:20:53,565
[SPEAKER_09]: Capcom.

968
01:20:54,145 --> 01:20:55,026
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, I know.

969
01:20:55,286 --> 01:20:56,126
[SPEAKER_09]: Silent Hill.

970
01:20:56,746 --> 01:20:57,327
[SPEAKER_22]: Konami.

971
01:20:57,407 --> 01:20:58,427
[SPEAKER_22]: Konami, there you go.

972
01:20:58,807 --> 01:20:59,147
[SPEAKER_33]: Good.

973
01:20:59,187 --> 01:20:59,547
[SPEAKER_22]: I know.

974
01:20:59,567 --> 01:21:02,128
[SPEAKER_33]: Yo, yo, turn down the Nature's Oxide.

975
01:21:02,408 --> 01:21:04,749
[SPEAKER_17]: Maybe we should send him a box of milk bones, too.

976
01:21:05,229 --> 01:21:05,610
[SPEAKER_17]: Wait, what?

977
01:21:05,910 --> 01:21:07,370
[SPEAKER_17]: Maybe we should send him another prize.

978
01:21:07,670 --> 01:21:07,950
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe.

979
01:21:08,070 --> 01:21:08,431
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll see.

980
01:21:08,691 --> 01:21:09,311
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll see if he's worth it.

981
01:21:09,331 --> 01:21:10,511
[SPEAKER_17]: We'll send you a rawhide bone.

982
01:21:10,751 --> 01:21:11,472
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's see how he does.

983
01:21:11,752 --> 01:21:12,312
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, here we go.

984
01:21:12,392 --> 01:21:13,032
[SPEAKER_09]: First question.

985
01:21:13,072 --> 01:21:13,672
[SPEAKER_09]: You guys ready?

986
01:21:14,753 --> 01:21:15,233
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, here it is.

987
01:21:16,781 --> 01:21:24,665
[SPEAKER_09]: Rob, hey that's me, was all excited to start a brand new blogger this week all about his video game addictions.

988
01:21:25,426 --> 01:21:34,850
[SPEAKER_09]: The staff and regulars of Orange Lounge Radio, though, were shocked when they visited the blog to find that the first entry wasn't about games at all, but about blank.

989
01:21:34,870 --> 01:21:36,571
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, don't answer just yet, Siggy.

990
01:21:36,811 --> 01:21:39,073
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll let celebrities have a chance to answer.

991
01:21:42,094 --> 01:21:45,556
[SPEAKER_09]: Orange Lounge Radio staff was surprised to visit the blogger

992
01:21:46,263 --> 01:21:51,327
[SPEAKER_09]: to find that it wasn't about video games at all, but the first entry was all about blank.

993
01:21:57,131 --> 01:21:58,112
[SPEAKER_09]: Everybody's writing down.

994
01:22:02,235 --> 01:22:04,076
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, MPQ's locked in an answer.

995
01:22:13,903 --> 01:22:14,544
[SPEAKER_09]: Jamie's dinged in.

996
01:22:32,202 --> 01:22:32,722
[SPEAKER_09]: Everybody ready?

997
01:22:33,483 --> 01:22:33,883

[SPEAKER_30]: I got it.

[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

01:22:36,604 --> 01:22:37,365
[SPEAKER_09]: How you doing, Explicit?

1001
01:22:37,445 --> 01:22:37,865
[SPEAKER_09]: Got an answer?

1002
01:22:38,725 --> 01:22:39,005
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

1003
01:22:40,646 --> 01:22:46,689
[SPEAKER_09]: Staff and regulars of Horne's Lounge, though, were shocked when they visited the blog to find that the first entry wasn't about games at all, but about blank.

1004
01:22:48,530 --> 01:22:49,291
[SPEAKER_09]: Angel, you got one?

1005
01:22:49,891 --> 01:22:50,391
[SPEAKER_09]: Still thinking.

1006
01:22:50,711 --> 01:22:51,412
[SPEAKER_09]: Angel's still thinking.

1007
01:22:59,136 --> 01:22:59,416
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

1008
01:23:02,428 --> 01:23:07,791
[SPEAKER_09]: This is the first thing that comes to your mind, Angel.

1009
01:23:09,591 --> 01:23:13,753
[SPEAKER_09]: Rob was all excited to start a brand new blogger this week, all about his video game addictions.

1010
01:23:13,833 --> 01:23:21,697
[SPEAKER_09]: The staff and regulars of Orange Launch Radio, though, were shocked when they visited the blog to find that the first entry wasn't about games at all, but about blank.

1011
01:23:25,018 --> 01:23:25,459
[SPEAKER_15]: Alright.

1012
01:23:28,260 --> 01:23:29,720
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, looks like she's written something down.

1013
01:23:29,760 --> 01:23:30,701
[SPEAKER_09]: Explicit, you good to go, too?

1014
01:23:34,466 --> 01:23:35,727
[SPEAKER_09]: Boobies Boobies Not a match, sorry

1015
01:24:02,799 --> 01:24:03,299
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, I'm sorry.

1016
01:24:04,059 --> 01:24:05,700
[SPEAKER_09]: I totally forgot the other person.

1017
01:24:06,060 --> 01:24:09,001
[SPEAKER_09]: MPQ put all about ham.

1018
01:24:09,881 --> 01:24:10,561
[SPEAKER_09]: All about ham.

1019
01:24:11,742 --> 01:24:14,523
[SPEAKER_09]: So boobies is not a match with ham or random prawn.

1020
01:24:14,723 --> 01:24:15,163
[SPEAKER_09]: Explicit.

1021
01:24:15,923 --> 01:24:16,603
[SPEAKER_09]: Gay porn.

1022
01:24:17,023 --> 01:24:21,585
[SPEAKER_09]: Gay porn, I do believe that would be a match with Siggy.

1023
01:24:21,665 --> 01:24:24,726
[SPEAKER_09]: So one point for Siggy, zero for MPQ.

1024
01:24:25,566 --> 01:24:30,767
[SPEAKER_09]: Loki, shocked to find it was all about Paris Hilton and her wonderful shoes.

1025
01:24:31,028 --> 01:24:32,148
[SPEAKER_09]: Paris Hilton!

1026
01:24:33,800 --> 01:24:34,480
[SPEAKER_09]: Not a match.

1027
01:24:35,061 --> 01:24:35,421
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry.

1028
01:24:36,061 --> 01:24:36,341
[SPEAKER_09]: Angel.

1029
01:24:37,642 --> 01:24:39,462
[SPEAKER_15]: You're going to give me a look from now.

1030
01:24:40,623 --> 01:24:41,643
[SPEAKER_15]: I said Kylie.

1031
01:24:42,484 --> 01:24:43,824
[SPEAKER_09]: All about Kylie.

1032
01:24:44,684 --> 01:24:46,545
[SPEAKER_09]: Very good answer, but not a match.

1033
01:24:46,605 --> 01:24:46,925
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry.

1034
01:24:47,045 --> 01:24:51,527
[SPEAKER_09]: My answer was it was all about how he needed a date.

1035
01:24:52,868 --> 01:24:54,068
[SPEAKER_09]: This is the part where you feel pity.

1036
01:24:54,088 --> 01:24:55,308
[SPEAKER_09]: Feel pity.

1037
01:24:55,328 --> 01:24:55,929
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

1038
01:24:55,949 --> 01:24:56,369
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

1039
01:24:56,409 --> 01:24:56,689
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

1040
01:24:56,709 --> 01:24:56,969
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

1041
01:24:57,029 --> 01:24:57,549
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

1042
01:24:57,809 --> 01:24:58,250
[SPEAKER_09]: That's enough.

1043
01:24:58,750 --> 01:24:59,030
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

1044
01:25:00,070 --> 01:25:00,370
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

1045
01:25:00,430 --> 01:25:01,891
[SPEAKER_09]: So Siggy's up by a point.

1046
01:25:02,796 --> 01:25:04,097
[SPEAKER_09]: Here we go, question number two.

1047
01:25:04,157 --> 01:25:06,319
[SPEAKER_09]: It's MPQ's chance to catch up here.

1048
01:25:07,599 --> 01:25:09,080
[SPEAKER_09]: Loki was very sad.

1049
01:25:09,501 --> 01:25:10,281
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, where's my music?

1050
01:25:11,022 --> 01:25:11,602
[SPEAKER_09]: Where's my music?

1051
01:25:12,843 --> 01:25:13,123
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

1052
01:25:13,764 --> 01:25:16,266
[SPEAKER_09]: Loki was very sad that his computer broke down.

1053
01:25:16,746 --> 01:25:19,908
[SPEAKER_09]: It seemed like the power supply just didn't want to cooperate anymore.

1054
01:25:20,609 --> 01:25:22,530
[SPEAKER_09]: He tried to fix it himself, but couldn't.

1055
01:25:23,110 --> 01:25:28,074
[SPEAKER_09]: So he had his friend look at the PC, who explained moments after opening it that...

1056
01:25:28,647 --> 01:25:33,771
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, Loki, maybe it wouldn't have broken down so fast if you hadn't downloaded so much blank.

1057
01:25:38,235 --> 01:25:42,539
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, Loki, maybe it wouldn't have broke if you hadn't downloaded so much blank.

1058
01:25:52,847 --> 01:25:53,928
[SPEAKER_30]: Very funny allusion.

1059
01:25:54,148 --> 01:25:54,749
[SPEAKER_30]: Very funny.

1060
01:25:56,210 --> 01:25:57,491
[SPEAKER_09]: I see our chat room there, huh?

1061
01:25:58,393 --> 01:25:58,613
[SPEAKER_30]: Yeah.

1062
01:25:59,733 --> 01:26:00,113
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright.

1063
01:26:04,114 --> 01:26:05,555
[SPEAKER_30]: Hey, laughter is my life, you know.

1064
01:26:07,475 --> 01:26:08,195
[SPEAKER_09]: Isn't this great?

1065
01:26:08,936 --> 01:26:15,337
[SPEAKER_09]: When you call in the Skype line to the show, the chat room feels the need to make fun of you as well as the rest of us here in studio.

1066
01:26:16,917 --> 01:26:17,358
[SPEAKER_08]: Beautiful.

1067
01:26:18,758 --> 01:26:19,058
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright.

1068
01:26:21,719 --> 01:26:23,839
[SPEAKER_09]: One more time, I'll read this for the folks still thinking.

1069
01:26:23,919 --> 01:26:27,320
[SPEAKER_09]: Loki was very sad that his computer broke down.

1070
01:26:28,183 --> 01:26:31,584
[SPEAKER_09]: It seemed like the power supply just didn't want to cooperate anymore.

1071
01:26:31,664 --> 01:26:33,365
[SPEAKER_09]: He tried to fix it himself, but couldn't.

1072
01:26:34,005 --> 01:26:42,068
[SPEAKER_09]: So he had his friend look at the PC, who explained moments after opening it that, Well, Loki, maybe it wouldn't have broken down so fast if you hadn't downloaded so much blank.

1073
01:26:44,529 --> 01:26:44,769
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright.

1074
01:26:46,990 --> 01:26:49,191
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm still waiting on the answer from MPQ as well.

1075
01:26:50,592 --> 01:26:51,172
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh no, there it is.

1076
01:26:56,314 --> 01:26:56,634
[SPEAKER_33]: Alright.

1077
01:26:56,654 --> 01:26:56,834
[SPEAKER_33]: Alright.

1078
01:27:01,291 --> 01:27:01,871
[SPEAKER_09]: How you guys doing?

1079
01:27:01,891 --> 01:27:02,311
[SPEAKER_09]: Are we ready?

1080
01:27:03,132 --> 01:27:03,992
[SPEAKER_09]: Looks like Angel's ready.

1081
01:27:04,392 --> 01:27:05,772
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, everybody else is ready.

1082
01:27:05,953 --> 01:27:09,254
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think... Alright, we got MPQ's answer too.

1083
01:27:09,574 --> 01:27:10,194
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, here we go.

1084
01:27:12,135 --> 01:27:13,555
[SPEAKER_09]: This time we'll go with MPQ first.

1085
01:27:13,675 --> 01:27:19,577
[SPEAKER_09]: MPQ says, Well, Loki, maybe it wouldn't have broken down so fast if you hadn't downloaded so much... PORN!

1086
01:27:20,357 --> 01:27:21,078
[SPEAKER_09]: Porn.

1087
01:27:21,698 --> 01:27:22,498
[SPEAKER_09]: Going for the obvious one there.

1088
01:27:22,518 --> 01:27:23,078
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, Siggy.

1089
01:27:24,058 --> 01:27:28,520
[SPEAKER_09]: It wouldn't have broken down so fast if you hadn't downloaded so much... That mania sim files!

1090
01:27:28,985 --> 01:27:30,806
[SPEAKER_09]: Step Mania Sim Files.

1091
01:27:31,247 --> 01:27:32,107
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, good answer.

1092
01:27:32,168 --> 01:27:32,528
[SPEAKER_09]: Good answer.

1093
01:27:32,548 --> 01:27:32,908
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's see.

1094
01:27:33,569 --> 01:27:36,251
[SPEAKER_09]: Jamie, wouldn't have broken so fast if you hadn't downloaded so much.

1095
01:27:37,412 --> 01:27:39,093
[SPEAKER_17]: Actually, I have to make this grammatically correct.

1096
01:27:39,353 --> 01:27:39,934
[SPEAKER_17]: So many.

1097
01:27:40,974 --> 01:27:42,556
[SPEAKER_17]: Final Fantasy XI porn patches.

1098
01:27:43,597 --> 01:27:45,658
[SPEAKER_09]: Final Fantasy XI porn patches.

1099
01:27:45,958 --> 01:27:46,259
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

1100
01:27:46,279 --> 01:27:47,299
[SPEAKER_09]: Is that a point for MPQ?

1101
01:27:47,700 --> 01:27:48,180
[SPEAKER_17]: Half a point.

1102
01:27:48,300 --> 01:27:49,281
[SPEAKER_09]: Half a point for MPQ.

1103
01:27:49,321 --> 01:27:51,082
[SPEAKER_09]: There's so many of those online.

1104
01:27:51,523 --> 01:27:52,684
[SPEAKER_09]: Half a point for MPQ.

1105
01:27:52,744 --> 01:27:53,044
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

1106
01:27:53,725 --> 01:27:55,466
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's half a point to one point.

1107
01:27:56,024 --> 01:27:57,145
[SPEAKER_09]: Remixes of girls Remixes of girls

1108
01:28:26,138 --> 01:28:26,598
[SPEAKER_09]: Good answer.

1109
01:28:26,638 --> 01:28:27,419
[SPEAKER_09]: Good answer.

1110
01:28:27,619 --> 01:28:27,999
[SPEAKER_09]: Not a match.

1111
01:28:28,580 --> 01:28:34,124
[SPEAKER_09]: And I said, it wouldn't have broken so fast if you hadn't downloaded so many crappy remixes of Max 300.

1112
01:28:34,504 --> 01:28:42,551
[SPEAKER_21]: Now, now, Max Vagina has its special place in everyone's heart.

1113
01:28:44,752 --> 01:28:46,754
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, MPQ has half a point.

1114
01:28:47,595 --> 01:28:48,736
[SPEAKER_09]: Siggy has one point.

1115
01:28:48,776 --> 01:28:50,517
[SPEAKER_09]: It all comes down to this question.

1116
01:28:51,255 --> 01:28:54,797
[SPEAKER_09]: One point for MPQ could win it if Siggy doesn't get any.

1117
01:28:55,117 --> 01:28:55,857
[SPEAKER_09]: So we will see.

1118
01:28:55,917 --> 01:28:58,679
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's good he got half a point because this way we're not going to have a tie.

1119
01:28:59,039 --> 01:29:00,360
[SPEAKER_09]: Unless we get a half a point on this next one.

1120
01:29:00,640 --> 01:29:01,120
[SPEAKER_09]: But we'll see.

1121
01:29:02,341 --> 01:29:04,622
[SPEAKER_09]: And we've had a question about me, a question about Loki.

1122
01:29:05,022 --> 01:29:06,363
[SPEAKER_09]: So you know who this next one's about.

1123
01:29:08,084 --> 01:29:08,464
[SPEAKER_17]: Shermie.

1124
01:29:09,344 --> 01:29:14,147
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura decided that she was going to head out to RVGL to play some DER.

1125
01:29:15,027 --> 01:29:16,808
[SPEAKER_09]: Unfortunately, the pads were broken.

1126
01:29:17,481 --> 01:29:24,807
[SPEAKER_09]: And even more unfortunately for the parents and children present, they were shocked to hear DarkSakura call the RVGL pads a blank.

1127
01:29:30,412 --> 01:29:34,936
[SPEAKER_09]: They were shocked to hear DarkSakura call the Roseville Golf Land pads a blank.

1128
01:29:38,118 --> 01:29:40,680
[SPEAKER_09]: You can play with the grammar on that one a little bit if you need to.

1129
01:29:40,760 --> 01:29:41,561
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll make this a little harder.

1130
01:29:41,581 --> 01:29:42,422
[SPEAKER_09]: You can play with the grammar.

1131
01:29:43,142 --> 01:29:46,305
[SPEAKER_09]: So she called the RVGL pads blank, or she called them a blank.

1132
01:29:51,787 --> 01:29:52,067
[SPEAKER_33]: Alright.

1133
01:29:54,350 --> 01:30:02,518
[SPEAKER_33]: You know, if we go this year, we need to go see The Price is Right.

1134
01:30:03,319 --> 01:30:04,019
[SPEAKER_33]: I know, I know.

1135
01:30:07,583 --> 01:30:08,944
[SPEAKER_33]: He isn't going to be living much longer.

1136
01:30:08,964 --> 01:30:10,966
[SPEAKER_33]: I mean, that hair can't turn much whiter.

1137
01:30:13,609 --> 01:30:14,490
[SPEAKER_33]: He'll be transparent soon.

1138
01:30:20,265 --> 01:30:23,210
[SPEAKER_09]: They were shocked to hear DarkSakura call the RVGL pads a blank.

1139
01:30:23,230 --> 01:30:24,853
[SPEAKER_09]: Oops, I didn't copy that question for MPQ.

1140
01:30:24,893 --> 01:30:25,715
[SPEAKER_09]: He might want to answer that.

1141
01:30:25,735 --> 01:30:28,099
[SPEAKER_09]: There we go.

1142
01:30:29,061 --> 01:30:29,982
[SPEAKER_09]: Now MPQ can answer.

1143
01:30:30,824 --> 01:30:31,124
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright.

1144
01:30:57,489 --> 01:30:58,971
[SPEAKER_09]: Nothing, I'm just laughing at one of the answers.

1145
01:30:59,412 --> 01:30:59,733
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright.

1146
01:31:01,295 --> 01:31:02,296
[SPEAKER_09]: Everybody ready in studio?

1147
01:31:02,496 --> 01:31:02,757
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes?

1148
01:31:04,019 --> 01:31:04,960
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, here we go.

1149
01:31:07,414 --> 01:31:08,634
[SPEAKER_09]: This is the last question.

1150
01:31:08,655 --> 01:31:11,797
[SPEAKER_09]: This is going to determine who walks away with a Resident Evil 4 music sampler.

1151
01:31:12,217 --> 01:31:15,600
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura decided that she was going to head out to RVGL and play some DDR.

1152
01:31:15,960 --> 01:31:23,405
[SPEAKER_09]: Unfortunately, the pads were broken, and even more unfortunately for the parents and children present, they were shocked to hear DarkSakura call the RVGL pads a... Siggy?

1153
01:31:24,126 --> 01:31:25,227
[SPEAKER_30]: Piece of shit pad!

1154
01:31:25,627 --> 01:31:27,248
[SPEAKER_09]: Piece of shit pad!

1155
01:31:27,709 --> 01:31:29,710
[SPEAKER_09]: Not a piece of shit car, but a piece of shit pad.

1156
01:31:30,511 --> 01:31:31,952
[SPEAKER_09]: MPQ's answer says...

1157
01:31:33,802 --> 01:31:40,386
[SPEAKER_09]: was shocked to hear DarkSakura call the Roseville Golf Land pads a, and I quote, fucking fuck shit fucker.

1158
01:31:42,447 --> 01:31:43,087
[SPEAKER_09]: So we will see.

1159
01:31:43,147 --> 01:31:46,529
[SPEAKER_09]: Piece of shit pad and fucking fuck shit fucker.

1160
01:31:47,390 --> 01:31:48,550
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, your answer, please.

1161
01:31:49,010 --> 01:31:51,292
[SPEAKER_17]: Metallic equivalent of fetid regurgitated dog shit.

1162
01:31:52,172 --> 01:31:52,632
[SPEAKER_09]: Wow.

1163
01:31:52,652 --> 01:31:56,374
[SPEAKER_17]: Because they were all too stupid to know what fetid means.

1164
01:32:01,137 --> 01:32:01,577
[SPEAKER_09]: Not a match.

1165
01:32:01,757 --> 01:32:02,798
[SPEAKER_09]: Explicit, your answer.

1166
01:32:04,528 --> 01:32:05,569
[SPEAKER_09]: A motherfucking bitch.

1167
01:32:06,149 --> 01:32:07,490
[SPEAKER_09]: A motherfucking bitch!

1168
01:32:08,250 --> 01:32:11,252
[SPEAKER_09]: It's kind of close, but I'm not going to count it as a match.

1169
01:32:11,312 --> 01:32:11,592
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry.

1170
01:32:11,712 --> 01:32:12,032
[SPEAKER_09]: Loki.

1171
01:32:13,233 --> 01:32:15,514
[SPEAKER_09]: Called them a... The loos.

1172
01:32:16,315 --> 01:32:17,095
[SPEAKER_09]: The loos.

1173
01:32:17,876 --> 01:32:18,876
[SPEAKER_09]: They are to loos.

1174
01:32:19,497 --> 01:32:19,877
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright.

1175
01:32:20,337 --> 01:32:20,737
[SPEAKER_09]: Angel.

1176
01:32:21,158 --> 01:32:24,960
[SPEAKER_16]: Called the pads a... Let's just say she dropped the C-bomb.

1177
01:32:25,660 --> 01:32:26,941
[SPEAKER_09]: She dropped the C-bomb.

1178
01:32:27,721 --> 01:32:28,302
[SPEAKER_17]: But I don't.

1179
01:32:28,502 --> 01:32:30,363
[SPEAKER_09]: Rhymes with punt or shunt.

1180
01:32:30,883 --> 01:32:33,645
[SPEAKER_17]: I couldn't think of anything else to quote Bette Midler.

1181
01:32:35,231 --> 01:32:40,494
[SPEAKER_17]: It starts with a C and ends with a T and it spells cunt.

1182
01:32:43,695 --> 01:32:44,596
[SPEAKER_09]: Now that would have been a good answer.

1183
01:32:44,796 --> 01:32:45,776
[SPEAKER_17]: That's a direct quote.

1184
01:32:46,076 --> 01:32:46,496
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright.

1185
01:32:48,297 --> 01:32:48,677
[SPEAKER_09]: Here it is.

1186
01:32:48,758 --> 01:32:49,978
[SPEAKER_09]: It all comes down to this.

1187
01:32:51,099 --> 01:32:54,600
[SPEAKER_09]: If MPQ matches me on this one, he's walking away with a CD.

1188
01:32:55,221 --> 01:32:59,363
[SPEAKER_09]: If nobody matches me or Siggy matches it, Siggy's walking away with that CD.

1189
01:33:00,163 --> 01:33:04,065
[SPEAKER_09]: They were shocked to hear DarkSakura call the Roseville Golf Land pads a...

1190
01:33:05,339 --> 01:33:09,400
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry your time than staying at home watching the Paris Hilton porn.

1191
01:33:09,820 --> 01:33:12,001
[SPEAKER_09]: Making Siggy our winner!

1192
01:33:12,761 --> 01:33:13,982
[SPEAKER_09]: By a half point.

1193
01:33:14,422 --> 01:33:17,863
[SPEAKER_17]: So if you want the CD, send me an email.

1194
01:33:18,963 --> 01:33:21,764
[SPEAKER_17]: Or actually, PM me your address and I will mail it to you.

1195
01:33:21,864 --> 01:33:25,425
[SPEAKER_33]: Now, now, watching the Paris Hilton video is not that sorry of a time.

1196
01:33:26,326 --> 01:33:27,426
[SPEAKER_33]: It is rather entertaining.

1197
01:33:28,723 --> 01:33:32,466
[SPEAKER_09]: So Siggy, you're our winner and you're going to win that Resident Evil 4 sampler.

1198
01:33:32,566 --> 01:33:33,086
[SPEAKER_09]: And you know what?

1199
01:33:33,146 --> 01:33:37,770
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm actually kind of glad you won it because now you'll be able to tell the difference between Resident Evil and Silent Hill.

1200
01:33:42,253 --> 01:33:43,174
[SPEAKER_09]: So thanks for playing.

1201
01:33:44,315 --> 01:33:45,836
[SPEAKER_09]: Any victory speech you want to give?

1202
01:33:46,596 --> 01:33:48,798
[SPEAKER_30]: Well, not much, but I got some latest.

1203
01:33:49,719 --> 01:33:49,979
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

1204
01:33:50,099 --> 01:33:50,659
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, sure.

1205
01:33:51,000 --> 01:33:52,601
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, some actual news on this show?

1206
01:33:53,081 --> 01:33:53,321
[SPEAKER_30]: Yep.

1207
01:33:53,481 --> 01:33:54,022
[SPEAKER_09]: The hell?

1208
01:33:54,342 --> 01:33:54,582
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

1209
01:33:54,622 --> 01:33:54,963
[SPEAKER_09]: What's up?

1210
01:33:55,063 --> 01:33:55,523
[SPEAKER_09]: What's up, Siggy?

1211
01:33:55,848 --> 01:33:58,630
[SPEAKER_30]: The last unlocked one was for the Scorpion Fire.

1212
01:33:58,690 --> 01:33:59,091
[SPEAKER_30]: Oh, okay.

1213
01:34:26,397 --> 01:34:30,079
[SPEAKER_29]: Well, that's the only one confirmed, number 13.

1214
01:34:30,259 --> 01:34:31,379
[SPEAKER_29]: Any response to the chat room?

1215
01:34:31,399 --> 01:34:32,280
[SPEAKER_09]: They're teasing you on your laugh.

1216
01:34:32,340 --> 01:34:34,821
[SPEAKER_30]: Do you have anything you want to say in response to that?

1217
01:34:52,540 --> 01:34:54,422
[SPEAKER_30]: Well, I don't care what these people say.

1218
01:34:54,482 --> 01:34:57,344
[SPEAKER_30]: I just like to laugh the way I wanted to.

1219
01:34:57,725 --> 01:34:58,545
[SPEAKER_09]: You preach on.

1220
01:34:58,645 --> 01:35:00,347
[SPEAKER_09]: Don't give a crap what our chatroom says.

1221
01:35:00,407 --> 01:35:01,288
[SPEAKER_09]: We sure don't, alright?

1222
01:35:02,048 --> 01:35:02,309
[SPEAKER_30]: Yeah.

1223
01:35:02,769 --> 01:35:03,430
[SPEAKER_30]: Oh, by the way.

1224
01:35:03,530 --> 01:35:03,770
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

1225
01:35:04,471 --> 01:35:08,454
[SPEAKER_30]: The song A and AA, they're actually pronounced as ace and double ace.

1226
01:35:09,535 --> 01:35:10,496
[SPEAKER_09]: Ace and double ace.

1227
01:35:11,036 --> 01:35:11,176
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

1228
01:35:11,317 --> 01:35:12,398
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, like a deck of cards.

1229
01:35:12,418 --> 01:35:13,218
[SPEAKER_09]: Ace and double ace.

1230
01:35:13,278 --> 01:35:13,579
[SPEAKER_09]: I get it.

1231
01:35:14,559 --> 01:35:15,380
[SPEAKER_09]: I like A and AA.

1232
01:35:15,400 --> 01:35:15,420
[SPEAKER_09]: I...

1233
01:35:20,556 --> 01:35:21,036
[SPEAKER_09]: Screw that.

1234
01:35:21,056 --> 01:35:22,657
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm going to call a member.

1235
01:35:22,697 --> 01:35:24,358
[SPEAKER_09]: EDR is the 13th step.

1236
01:35:24,778 --> 01:35:28,080
[SPEAKER_09]: Or A and A. Ah.

1237
01:35:29,681 --> 01:35:30,041
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

1238
01:35:30,161 --> 01:35:31,242
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks for the call, Siggy.

1239
01:35:31,342 --> 01:35:32,542
[SPEAKER_09]: Congratulations on your win.

1240
01:35:32,882 --> 01:35:33,142
[SPEAKER_09]: Email.

1241
01:35:33,162 --> 01:35:34,263
[SPEAKER_09]: You got Jamie's email, right?

1242
01:35:34,783 --> 01:35:35,444
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah.

1243
01:35:35,724 --> 01:35:37,445
[SPEAKER_17]: Actually, I'll just send a private message.

1244
01:35:37,865 --> 01:35:38,105
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

1245
01:35:38,605 --> 01:35:39,446
[SPEAKER_09]: He'll send a private message.

1246
01:35:39,486 --> 01:35:40,306
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, I'm in the chat room right now.

1247
01:35:40,346 --> 01:35:40,586
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

1248
01:35:40,886 --> 01:35:41,066
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah.

1249
01:35:41,287 --> 01:35:41,747
[SPEAKER_09]: Sounds good.

1250
01:35:42,287 --> 01:35:42,587
[SPEAKER_17]: All right.

1251
01:35:42,987 --> 01:35:43,828
[SPEAKER_09]: Congratulations, man.

1252
01:35:44,268 --> 01:35:44,868
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Sky.

1253
01:35:44,928 --> 01:35:45,329
[SPEAKER_09]: No problem.

1254
01:35:45,369 --> 01:35:45,709
[SPEAKER_09]: Good job.

1255
01:35:46,029 --> 01:35:46,309
[SPEAKER_09]: Bye.

1256
01:35:46,569 --> 01:35:47,630
[SPEAKER_17]: I just wanted to be accurate.

1257
01:35:47,670 --> 01:35:49,511
[SPEAKER_17]: According to Dennis, Larry Nyquil is the 13th step.

1258
01:35:51,647 --> 01:35:59,569
[SPEAKER_33]: When I hear the word ace, I can't help but think of... Of, um... What was that?

1259
01:35:59,689 --> 01:36:00,449
[SPEAKER_33]: Wild Zero?

1260
01:36:00,469 --> 01:36:01,369
[SPEAKER_33]: Or whatever?

1261
01:36:02,489 --> 01:36:02,729
[SPEAKER_02]: What?

1262
01:36:03,049 --> 01:36:07,210
[SPEAKER_33]: Or, not Wild Zero, um... That stupid zombie movie.

1263
01:36:08,751 --> 01:36:09,091
[SPEAKER_33]: Remember?

1264
01:36:09,511 --> 01:36:11,291
[SPEAKER_09]: I have no idea what you're talking about right now.

1265
01:36:11,311 --> 01:36:12,051
[SPEAKER_33]: That was Wild Zero.

1266
01:36:12,071 --> 01:36:12,931
[SPEAKER_33]: Yeah, it was Wild Zero.

1267
01:36:13,031 --> 01:36:15,272
[SPEAKER_17]: I got you the soundtrack, the record for that.

1268
01:36:16,492 --> 01:36:17,192
[SPEAKER_09]: I do remember that.

1269
01:36:17,372 --> 01:36:18,132
[SPEAKER_09]: I have that still.

1270
01:36:18,152 --> 01:36:18,793
[SPEAKER_17]: Who was it?

1271
01:36:18,853 --> 01:36:20,013
[SPEAKER_17]: Guitar... Guitar Wolf.

1272
01:36:20,093 --> 01:36:20,853
[SPEAKER_17]: Guitar Wolf, that was it.

1273
01:36:21,730 --> 01:36:21,930
[SPEAKER_09]: Ace!

1274
01:36:21,950 --> 01:36:24,692
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, I'm lost.

1275
01:36:24,912 --> 01:36:25,392
[SPEAKER_09]: That's all right.

1276
01:36:26,633 --> 01:36:30,074
[SPEAKER_17]: Every time I hear Ace, I start thinking of this line from Red Dwarf.

1277
01:36:31,015 --> 01:36:33,436
[SPEAKER_17]: Your nickname was never Ace, maybe Ace Hole.

1278
01:36:34,997 --> 01:36:35,737
[SPEAKER_09]: You're an Ace Hole.

1279
01:36:38,299 --> 01:36:48,484
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't know if anybody in here watched a lot of Red Dwarf, but Rimmer always called himself Ace, and finally Lister told him off and said that his nickname was Ace Hole.

1280
01:36:49,785 --> 01:36:50,105
[SPEAKER_19]: All right.

1281
01:36:51,615 --> 01:36:58,786
[SPEAKER_09]: We're going to go to break, and in this break we're going to hear... I decide we'll play some number 13, and we'll play some Ace as well.

1282
01:36:59,086 --> 01:37:00,789
[SPEAKER_09]: Or as I like to say it, Ah!

1283
01:37:01,550 --> 01:37:01,670
[SPEAKER_09]: Ah!

1284
01:37:02,672 --> 01:37:05,977
[SPEAKER_09]: So we'll play that, and then we're going to do the cage match when we come back.

1285
01:37:07,199 --> 01:37:07,639
[SPEAKER_09]: Orange Lounge Radio

1286
01:38:47,953 --> 01:38:48,941
Thanks for watching!

1287
01:39:36,926 --> 01:39:38,267
Thanks for watching!

1288
01:40:10,269 --> 01:40:11,750
Thanks for watching!

1289
01:41:30,468 --> 01:41:31,493
Thanks for watching!

1290
01:42:34,850 --> 01:42:35,932
Thanks for watching!

1291
01:43:17,168 --> 01:43:19,550
From the steps by the Orange Lab, this DDR sucks!

1292
01:43:55,259 --> 01:44:00,661
[SPEAKER_09]: We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio and Jamie's spreading the inside joke love here in the studio.

1293
01:44:01,681 --> 01:44:04,962
[SPEAKER_17]: This is an old joke from Under Sedation Live.

1294
01:44:05,402 --> 01:44:05,742
[SPEAKER_09]: I know.

1295
01:44:06,862 --> 01:44:09,623
[SPEAKER_17]: You know, wasn't that reunion show supposed to happen like soon?

1296
01:44:09,683 --> 01:44:10,543
[SPEAKER_17]: It's supposed to eventually.

1297
01:44:10,883 --> 01:44:11,183
[SPEAKER_29]: Okay.

1298
01:44:11,743 --> 01:44:14,584
[SPEAKER_17]: But this was back when Mint Skittles came out

1299
01:44:15,778 --> 01:44:22,265
[SPEAKER_17]: and Travis was joking about them making mint scattles to make your butt be minty fresh.

1300
01:44:22,546 --> 01:44:23,907
[SPEAKER_17]: And I made a label for it.

1301
01:44:23,927 --> 01:44:26,050
[SPEAKER_09]: You actually made the label in PaintShop Pro.

1302
01:44:26,090 --> 01:44:27,471
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sorry, I forgot you're not a Photoshop girl.

1303
01:44:27,632 --> 01:44:29,093
[SPEAKER_17]: I have to use Photoshop and I hate it.

1304
01:44:29,334 --> 01:44:29,594
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyway,

1305
01:44:32,071 --> 01:44:33,152
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1306
01:44:52,802 --> 01:44:53,082
[SPEAKER_09]: EverQuest 2

1307
01:45:12,182 --> 01:45:16,224
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, they're going to add a new command line feature into EverQuest 2.

1308
01:45:16,844 --> 01:45:22,866
[SPEAKER_09]: You know how you can slash say, slash fight, you type in the little command slash whatever?

1309
01:45:23,466 --> 01:45:25,627
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, they're putting a new one into EverQuest 2.

1310
01:45:26,327 --> 01:45:27,988
[SPEAKER_09]: It's called slash pizza.

1311
01:45:29,268 --> 01:45:41,493
[SPEAKER_09]: And if you type slash pizza, it'll actually open up a little web browser right on top of your EverQuest 2 screen and take you directly to PizzaHut.com where you can order a pizza and have it delivered immediately.

1312
01:45:41,966 --> 01:45:46,810
[SPEAKER_09]: Right to your home so that you can play EverQuest all night long.

1313
01:45:46,970 --> 01:45:48,351
[SPEAKER_17]: That's fucking sad.

1314
01:45:50,193 --> 01:45:53,695
[SPEAKER_09]: This is exactly why I wanted to bring this up for Jamie's reaction.

1315
01:45:53,715 --> 01:45:54,676
[SPEAKER_31]: What the fuck?

1316
01:45:56,097 --> 01:45:57,178
[SPEAKER_09]: Slash pizza.

1317
01:45:57,478 --> 01:46:01,502
[SPEAKER_09]: If they incorporated this into Final Fantasy XI, Jamie, do you see this as a feature you'd ever use?

1318
01:46:02,442 --> 01:46:02,723
[SPEAKER_17]: No.

1319
01:46:03,944 --> 01:46:04,504
[SPEAKER_09]: And why not?

1320
01:46:04,924 --> 01:46:10,249
[SPEAKER_17]: Because if I'm hungry, I can go into the kitchen and cook some food.

1321
01:46:12,003 --> 01:46:16,807
[SPEAKER_17]: If I wanted to go out to eat, my ass would log out and go out to eat.

1322
01:46:17,448 --> 01:46:18,369
[SPEAKER_17]: Because guess what?

1323
01:46:18,729 --> 01:46:20,391
[SPEAKER_17]: There's real people out in the world.

1324
01:46:20,451 --> 01:46:22,533
[SPEAKER_09]: But you've had pizza delivered to you before, right?

1325
01:46:22,573 --> 01:46:23,373
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe once in a while?

1326
01:46:24,254 --> 01:46:28,938
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, but not like because I was too lazy to log my ass off the damn game and go get it.

1327
01:46:29,239 --> 01:46:34,443
[SPEAKER_17]: Right, you order pizza because, you know, you want... I was too lazy to go get away from my movie and go get it.

1328
01:46:34,503 --> 01:46:36,005
[SPEAKER_09]: Exactly, exactly.

1329
01:46:38,388 --> 01:46:54,036
[SPEAKER_09]: The sad thing is, I know people that will use, I would probably use this quite a bit if they put this in Final Fantasy XI, but at the same time, that would probably be the point where I'd have to say, oh my god, Rob, look at yourself.

1330
01:46:54,536 --> 01:46:56,777
[SPEAKER_09]: Should I be happy if we had a Pizza Hut near us?

1331
01:46:59,678 --> 01:47:01,739
[SPEAKER_09]: That's true, we don't even have a Pizza Hut in town.

1332
01:47:02,020 --> 01:47:04,621
[SPEAKER_17]: The pizza place closest to my house is actually Roundtable.

1333
01:47:05,539 --> 01:47:09,241
[SPEAKER_09]: Right, so even if they built this into Final Fantasy XI, we wouldn't be able to use it.

1334
01:47:09,601 --> 01:47:12,002
[SPEAKER_09]: If we could only pay for those pizzas in Gil.

1335
01:47:15,263 --> 01:47:17,004
[SPEAKER_09]: That's the next thing we're moving to.

1336
01:47:17,044 --> 01:47:20,285
[SPEAKER_09]: What if you could pay for the pizza using the online game currency?

1337
01:47:20,345 --> 01:47:21,505
[SPEAKER_09]: How sad would that be?

1338
01:47:21,825 --> 01:47:22,826
[SPEAKER_17]: That would be really sad.

1339
01:47:22,846 --> 01:47:28,168
[SPEAKER_09]: Or like, if you order the pizza, then your character gets a vitality up or something.

1340
01:47:30,149 --> 01:47:33,070
[SPEAKER_09]: Maximum hit points have increased because you ordered Pizza Hut.

1341
01:47:33,965 --> 01:47:35,406
[SPEAKER_09]: Is this where advertising is going?

1342
01:47:37,047 --> 01:47:39,288
[SPEAKER_09]: Order Taco Bell and receive bio effect.

1343
01:47:46,031 --> 01:47:49,953
[SPEAKER_17]: No, and if you, like, order from Del Taco, you get the dia one.

1344
01:47:52,294 --> 01:47:53,254
[SPEAKER_17]: You mean diarrhea?

1345
01:47:53,495 --> 01:47:55,736
[SPEAKER_09]: Is that what you... Okay.

1346
01:47:55,776 --> 01:47:56,236
[SPEAKER_31]: Or anything...

1347
01:48:01,224 --> 01:48:02,686
[SPEAKER_31]: Order any hot sauce to cast fire.

1348
01:48:04,069 --> 01:48:05,671
[SPEAKER_31]: Actually, Faraga, sorry.

1349
01:48:06,352 --> 01:48:10,198
[SPEAKER_09]: Your ass begins casting fire on little goblin.

1350
01:48:12,141 --> 01:48:13,423
[SPEAKER_09]: Wow, that's amazing.

1351
01:48:17,836 --> 01:48:19,517
[SPEAKER_09]: What other slash features do you think?

1352
01:48:19,857 --> 01:48:21,737
[SPEAKER_09]: First, slash pizza, what's next?

1353
01:48:22,078 --> 01:48:23,198
[SPEAKER_09]: Slash blowjob?

1354
01:48:24,318 --> 01:48:28,540
[SPEAKER_09]: Get a hooker to come to your house and have sex with you because nobody else will because you play EverQuest all day?

1355
01:48:28,580 --> 01:48:31,281
[SPEAKER_17]: No, you'd order an in-game prostitute.

1356
01:48:34,302 --> 01:48:37,323
[SPEAKER_09]: So I would like to just kind of humor that question.

1357
01:48:37,623 --> 01:48:41,945
[SPEAKER_09]: What other type of slash features would you like to see in EverQuest?

1358
01:48:42,865 --> 01:48:44,626
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, this might make a good list list later on.

1359
01:48:44,986 --> 01:48:45,506
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll have to see.

1360
01:48:46,050 --> 01:48:54,594
[SPEAKER_09]: I would think a good one would be slash exercise, where when you type it in, the game shuts down and your computer shuts off and it won't let you turn it on for 50 minutes.

1361
01:48:55,014 --> 01:48:56,194
[SPEAKER_09]: So you have to go out and exercise.

1362
01:48:59,916 --> 01:49:04,538
[SPEAKER_33]: Yes, you can see my computer has gone into that feature right now.

1363
01:49:04,558 --> 01:49:06,479
[SPEAKER_00]: Apparently you typed it in earlier, Loki.

1364
01:49:10,701 --> 01:49:13,162
[SPEAKER_17]: No, you actually have this bodysuit that you wear.

1365
01:49:14,500 --> 01:49:18,882
[SPEAKER_17]: And if you type in slash exercise, then these little things stimulate your muscles to contract.

1366
01:49:20,643 --> 01:49:21,564
[SPEAKER_09]: They actually do have those.

1367
01:49:21,604 --> 01:49:23,645
[SPEAKER_09]: Like those ab things that they put on your abs?

1368
01:49:23,805 --> 01:49:24,685
[SPEAKER_17]: You want to know what that is?

1369
01:49:25,686 --> 01:49:26,566
[SPEAKER_17]: And this is a story.

1370
01:49:28,127 --> 01:49:30,989
[SPEAKER_17]: A long time ago when I worked at GNC, I hurt my butt.

1371
01:49:32,490 --> 01:49:36,092
[SPEAKER_17]: I actually strained the muscle that sits on top of my sciatic nerve.

1372
01:49:38,053 --> 01:49:40,694
[SPEAKER_17]: And I had to have that done to my butt.

1373
01:49:43,072 --> 01:49:49,918
[SPEAKER_17]: And so they would make the muscles contract and expand to the point that it gets tired out as though you had exercised it.

1374
01:49:49,938 --> 01:49:51,319
[SPEAKER_17]: And that's all that that ab thing is.

1375
01:49:53,121 --> 01:49:54,943
[SPEAKER_09]: So it just makes you feel like you've exercised it?

1376
01:49:55,423 --> 01:49:55,803
[SPEAKER_17]: Sort of.

1377
01:49:55,843 --> 01:49:58,085
[SPEAKER_17]: It's just to wear out the muscles to the point it would relax.

1378
01:49:58,265 --> 01:50:00,187
[SPEAKER_17]: Because for me it was hitting the nerve.

1379
01:50:00,327 --> 01:50:01,568
[SPEAKER_09]: That sounds painful.

1380
01:50:01,628 --> 01:50:03,870
[SPEAKER_09]: I could never put one of those things on.

1381
01:50:04,031 --> 01:50:04,931
[SPEAKER_17]: It's light electricity.

1382
01:50:06,273 --> 01:50:09,756
[SPEAKER_17]: But they also do that for patients who have...

1383
01:50:10,492 --> 01:50:13,294
[SPEAKER_17]: to keep the muscles from atrophy.

1384
01:50:13,454 --> 01:50:15,856
[SPEAKER_29]: Isn't that like how Spider-Man became Spider-Man?

1385
01:50:16,657 --> 01:50:18,638
[SPEAKER_17]: No, he got bitten by a damn radioactive spider.

1386
01:50:18,918 --> 01:50:22,261
[SPEAKER_29]: Well, radioactive spider, radioactive ab belt, same thing.

1387
01:50:22,281 --> 01:50:23,862
[SPEAKER_17]: It's not radioactive, it's electricity.

1388
01:50:25,603 --> 01:50:26,364
[SPEAKER_17]: Close enough.

1389
01:50:29,726 --> 01:50:30,086
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

1390
01:50:34,330 --> 01:50:38,052
[SPEAKER_09]: I guess we'll get into the Orange Lounge Radio cage match since all those jokes are...

1391
01:50:40,779 --> 01:50:41,659
[SPEAKER_17]: I agree with Elmo.

1392
01:50:41,779 --> 01:50:43,480
[SPEAKER_17]: There needs to be a slash slash.

1393
01:50:45,061 --> 01:50:48,783
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, except they said, for me, what are you implying?

1394
01:50:48,823 --> 01:50:53,846
[SPEAKER_09]: That I can't write my own erotic stories offline?

1395
01:50:54,206 --> 01:50:54,586
[SPEAKER_09]: Please.

1396
01:50:58,669 --> 01:51:00,830
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, let's get into tonight's cage match, boys and girls.

1403
01:51:42,727 --> 01:51:45,707
[SPEAKER_09]: You only get to hear a clip of it though, because you've already heard it before.

[SPEAKER_20]: The feeling is elating, biding my time Yeah, I know that you'll soon be mine Soon to mine Can't let you see me Can't let you see me

1410
01:53:58,883 --> 01:54:02,127
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, that's our returning champion, Freeze Pop with Stakeout.

1411
01:54:02,207 --> 01:54:09,476
[SPEAKER_09]: It is up against two new songs this week, starting off with a song that Jamie picked, and it actually looks like one I've heard before, but not in this.

1412
01:54:10,858 --> 01:54:13,020
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't remember the name of the song, I just picked it.

1413
01:54:13,621 --> 01:54:15,844
[SPEAKER_17]: It's the filter in Crystal Method.

1414
01:54:17,350 --> 01:54:19,312
[SPEAKER_17]: and I don't remember the name of the song.

1415
01:54:19,332 --> 01:54:20,593
[SPEAKER_09]: It's called Can't You Trip Like I Do.

1416
01:54:20,773 --> 01:54:20,993
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

1417
01:54:21,353 --> 01:54:21,573
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

1418
01:54:22,154 --> 01:54:25,336
[SPEAKER_09]: And it was actually a popular song several years ago, but we'll see.

1419
01:54:25,556 --> 01:54:26,557
[SPEAKER_09]: Spawn soundtrack.

1420
01:54:26,617 --> 01:54:27,498
[SPEAKER_09]: It was on the Spawn soundtrack.

1421
01:54:27,538 --> 01:54:27,938
[SPEAKER_09]: That's right.

1422
01:54:27,958 --> 01:54:28,739
[SPEAKER_17]: See, I didn't know that.

1423
01:54:28,799 --> 01:54:29,580
[SPEAKER_17]: I just like the song.

1424
01:54:29,680 --> 01:54:30,120
[SPEAKER_09]: That's all right.

1425
01:54:30,360 --> 01:54:31,141
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey, there's nothing.

1426
01:54:31,161 --> 01:54:34,083
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey, I put Gwen Stefani in and it ended up getting retired.

1427
01:54:34,103 --> 01:54:35,564
[SPEAKER_09]: There's nothing wrong with putting a popular song in.

1428
01:54:35,584 --> 01:54:39,407
[SPEAKER_33]: That's why they picked this song as a cadence like way earlier.

1429
01:54:39,447 --> 01:54:41,709
[SPEAKER_09]: No, you picked Crystal Method before, but never this one.

1430
01:54:42,329 --> 01:54:44,090
[SPEAKER_33]: Who the hell cares anyways?

1431
01:54:44,150 --> 01:54:44,850
[SPEAKER_33]: We can't remember it.

1432
01:54:44,910 --> 01:54:45,270
[SPEAKER_33]: It doesn't matter.

1433
01:54:45,290 --> 01:54:45,710
[SPEAKER_09]: That's right.

1434
01:54:45,730 --> 01:54:47,110
[SPEAKER_09]: If we don't remember, then it wasn't in.

1435
01:54:47,210 --> 01:54:47,730
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, here it is.

1436
01:54:48,191 --> 01:54:49,971
[SPEAKER_09]: Song number two of tonight's Cage Match.

1437
01:54:50,311 --> 01:54:51,731
[SPEAKER_09]: Filter and Crystal Method.

1438
01:54:51,811 --> 01:54:53,212
[SPEAKER_09]: Can't you trip like I do?

1439
01:55:40,811 --> 01:55:41,715
[SPEAKER_20]: Just like I do

1440
01:56:22,421 --> 01:56:26,327
Just like that Just like that Just like that

1441
01:58:06,548 --> 01:58:07,693
Thanks for watching!

1442
01:59:06,975 --> 01:59:09,497
We can't you trip like me We can't you trip like me

1443
01:59:32,213 --> 01:59:33,914
[SPEAKER_32]: I like the drums in the actual song.

1444
01:59:33,934 --> 01:59:37,597
[SPEAKER_32]: I mean, it's a pretty good song, but I don't know.

1445
01:59:37,617 --> 01:59:39,958
[SPEAKER_32]: The voice is kind of, I don't know.

1446
01:59:39,998 --> 01:59:40,939
[SPEAKER_32]: I'd say 8.5.

1447
01:59:41,199 --> 01:59:40,939
8.5.

1448
01:59:41,660 --> 01:59:41,960
[SPEAKER_33]: Loki.

1449
01:59:43,401 --> 01:59:44,121
[SPEAKER_33]: This song is old.

1450
01:59:44,181 --> 01:59:47,304
[SPEAKER_33]: I used to play this song while playing Cusar.

1451
01:59:48,184 --> 01:59:50,045
[SPEAKER_33]: So, it gets the 9.

1452
01:59:50,266 --> 01:59:51,426
[SPEAKER_33]: The spontaneous record is good.

1453
01:59:51,446 --> 01:59:53,688
[SPEAKER_33]: I like Satan on there.

1454
01:59:53,728 --> 01:59:54,729
[SPEAKER_33]: That was my favorite one.

1455
01:59:54,829 --> 01:59:55,269
[SPEAKER_09]: You would.

1456
01:59:55,589 --> 01:59:55,849
[SPEAKER_09]: Angel.

1457
01:59:55,869 --> 01:59:55,849
9.

1458
01:59:58,231 --> 01:59:58,992
[SPEAKER_16]: Junker Cover Pants.

1459
01:59:59,092 --> 01:59:59,372
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean, 9. 9.

1460
02:00:02,122 --> 02:00:02,442
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

1461
02:00:02,883 --> 02:00:03,804
[SPEAKER_09]: And I give, I know, I know.

1462
02:00:04,164 --> 02:00:10,550
[SPEAKER_09]: I give it, um, it's like one of those songs, like it starts off really, really cool, and then as it goes on, I'm kind of like, alright, time to end.

1463
02:00:11,031 --> 02:00:11,992
[SPEAKER_09]: But I still like it.

1464
02:00:12,192 --> 02:00:12,633
[SPEAKER_09]: It's groovy.

1465
02:00:12,833 --> 02:00:13,854
[SPEAKER_09]: I give it like a 7.5.

1466
02:00:14,835 --> 02:00:15,155
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright.

1467
02:00:16,456 --> 02:00:17,337
[SPEAKER_09]: Loki, your turn.

1468
02:00:17,678 --> 02:00:19,539
[SPEAKER_09]: Song number three tonight is by you.

1469
02:00:20,000 --> 02:00:20,560
[SPEAKER_09]: What'd you pick?

1470
02:00:20,881 --> 02:00:22,282
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, it's not by you, but you picked it.

1471
02:00:24,689 --> 02:00:49,820
[SPEAKER_33]: Uh, well, um, this song, um, I don't really know how to describe this song, this song is just different, it's one of those things I found on Amazon when searching for free music, um, and it's just catchy, I, I don't know, a lot of people aren't gonna like it, but, you know, I like, I've been listening to my car, it's just catchy, and apparently it's, it was, it's a

1472
02:00:50,382 --> 02:01:10,276
[SPEAKER_33]: I guess on the charts over in India, because that's, you know, it's an Indian artist, DJ Siddharth did the remix of it, and it's from a movie, I can't remember what the movie's called though, I think it's like Tamil or something like that, but I don't know.

1473
02:01:10,876 --> 02:01:14,879
[SPEAKER_33]: But yeah, it's a very, it's an interesting song.

1474
02:01:15,479 --> 02:01:18,141
[SPEAKER_33]: It's trancy, dancey, it's got a little bit of guitar in the background.

1475
02:01:18,161 --> 02:01:19,382
[SPEAKER_09]: Can you pronounce this name?

1476
02:01:21,245 --> 02:01:24,286
[SPEAKER_33]: I think it's pronounced like Keka Keka or something.

1477
02:01:24,326 --> 02:01:25,767
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, that's the artist, Keka Keka.

1478
02:01:25,807 --> 02:01:26,807
[SPEAKER_33]: Keka Keka is the artist.

1479
02:01:26,867 --> 02:01:29,348
[SPEAKER_33]: It's the Tamil song is the name of the actual song.

1480
02:01:29,948 --> 02:01:35,430
[SPEAKER_09]: It says in the title, it says, and I apologize profusely to everybody.

1481
02:01:35,450 --> 02:01:37,191
[SPEAKER_33]: That's the movie it's from, actually.

1482
02:01:38,672 --> 02:01:39,772
[SPEAKER_33]: It's the movie that it's from.

1483
02:01:39,832 --> 02:01:40,732
[SPEAKER_09]: Yuri and Yuri.

1484
02:01:40,992 --> 02:01:42,193
[SPEAKER_09]: Yuri and Yuri, it looks like.

1485
02:01:42,293 --> 02:01:44,274
[SPEAKER_09]: Yuri and Yuri, that's the movie that it's from.

1486
02:01:44,334 --> 02:01:44,614
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

1487
02:01:44,834 --> 02:01:47,715
[SPEAKER_33]: Tamil is the language that I think it's spoken in, and...

1488
02:01:48,317 --> 02:01:54,986
[SPEAKER_33]: It's the title song for that movie and it's remixed by this guy DJ Siddharth and the artist was Keka Keka.

1489
02:01:55,146 --> 02:01:58,471
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, DJ Siddharth remixing Keka Keka.

1490
02:01:59,011 --> 02:01:59,492

[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, we are back, and that was Kika Kika, DJ Siddharth remixing that, a song we, I believe, and I apologize again for butchering, absolutely butchering the pronunciation of this, Yurian Yuri.

1497
02:08:22,575 --> 02:08:23,675
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's see what you guys think.

1498
02:08:24,656 --> 02:08:25,576
[SPEAKER_09]: Jamie, DarkSakura.

1499
02:08:25,997 --> 02:08:27,778
[SPEAKER_16]: That was pretty good, 8.5.

1500
02:08:27,818 --> 02:08:28,758
[SPEAKER_09]: 8.5 from DarkSakura.

1501
02:08:29,639 --> 02:08:30,079
[SPEAKER_09]: Exquisite.

1502
02:08:31,052 --> 02:08:31,812
[SPEAKER_32]: That's pretty good.

1503
02:08:32,353 --> 02:08:39,756
[SPEAKER_32]: For some reason, I didn't like the beginning too much, but once I started getting to the actual music, I liked it.

1504
02:08:39,896 --> 02:08:39,756
8.5.

1505
02:08:39,916 --> 02:08:40,636
[SPEAKER_09]: 8.5 from Miss Blissett.

1506
02:08:40,996 --> 02:08:41,536
[SPEAKER_09]: Uh, Loki.

1507
02:08:41,877 --> 02:08:43,397
[SPEAKER_33]: I love the backbeat to that song.

1508
02:08:43,437 --> 02:08:48,539
[SPEAKER_33]: That was one of the things about DJ Siddharth, even his other stuff that he has, he has really good beats to all of it.

1509
02:08:49,560 --> 02:08:56,042
[SPEAKER_33]: Why he chose, I mean, I understand why he chose to remix that song, because he's, you know, an Indian DJ, so, I mean, it makes sense.

1510
02:08:56,543 --> 02:08:59,184
[SPEAKER_33]: But, um, it was, I don't know, I...

1511
02:09:01,007 --> 02:09:08,534
[SPEAKER_33]: If I understood the vocals, I'm sure it'd make more sense, or if I heard the original song, it'd make more sense to me, but since I didn't, you know, I give it a 9, though.

1512
02:09:08,634 --> 02:09:11,617
[SPEAKER_33]: It's decent, but it probably is annoying to a lot of people.

1513
02:09:12,518 --> 02:09:12,798
[SPEAKER_08]: Angel!

1514
02:09:14,400 --> 02:09:19,725
[SPEAKER_16]: I liked it a lot, just like another, well, Indian artist that I heard.

1515
02:09:19,965 --> 02:09:23,909
[SPEAKER_16]: It kind of just reminded me of that, so, um, I'll be nice.

1516
02:09:24,289 --> 02:09:24,730
[SPEAKER_16]: I'll give it a 9.

1517
02:09:27,469 --> 02:09:29,351
[SPEAKER_29]: I actually surprisingly like that song quite a bit.

1518
02:09:29,411 --> 02:09:31,414
[SPEAKER_09]: I just think it needed some of the fat trimmed from it.

1519
02:09:31,474 --> 02:09:34,819
[SPEAKER_09]: Like the beginning was a little slow and there's some parts that could have been cut.

1520
02:09:34,839 --> 02:09:37,603
[SPEAKER_09]: Because that song was just about over six minutes.

1521
02:09:38,284 --> 02:09:42,971
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think it could have been cut down a little bit, a little more compact, about four minutes probably would have been good.

1522
02:09:43,391 --> 02:09:44,852
[SPEAKER_09]: Otherwise, though, I do like the beat.

1523
02:09:44,952 --> 02:09:46,613
[SPEAKER_09]: I like kind of what they remixed there.

1524
02:09:46,633 --> 02:09:47,353
[SPEAKER_09]: That was pretty cool.

1525
02:09:48,033 --> 02:09:53,416
[SPEAKER_09]: I understand, though, why it has the big beginning, because it's probably meant for mixing in to your normal... Yeah.

1526
02:09:53,977 --> 02:09:57,719
[SPEAKER_09]: But as far as, you know, playing it by itself, it kind of hurts it for that.

1527
02:09:57,779 --> 02:09:58,999
[SPEAKER_09]: So I give it an 8.5, though.

1528
02:09:59,019 --> 02:09:59,720
[SPEAKER_09]: It was still a good song.

1529
02:10:00,440 --> 02:10:00,680
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

1530
02:10:01,300 --> 02:10:04,082
[SPEAKER_09]: Which is surprising that I liked yet another Loki's Caveman song.

1531
02:10:04,282 --> 02:10:05,723
[SPEAKER_09]: You know the one you put in a couple weeks ago?

1532
02:10:05,743 --> 02:10:07,464
[SPEAKER_09]: I've been listening to it a ton in my car.

1533
02:10:07,484 --> 02:10:08,484
[SPEAKER_09]: Which song was it?

1534
02:10:08,524 --> 02:10:09,945
[SPEAKER_09]: The Echoing Green one.

1535
02:10:10,962 --> 02:10:13,624
[SPEAKER_09]: And I actually downloaded, you know the funny thing about that?

1536
02:10:13,724 --> 02:10:16,045
[SPEAKER_09]: Echo Image, because you said it sounded like them.

1537
02:10:16,365 --> 02:10:18,446
[SPEAKER_09]: Echo Image actually remixed that song.

1538
02:10:18,586 --> 02:10:19,667
[SPEAKER_09]: It's available on iTunes.

1539
02:10:19,707 --> 02:10:21,328
[SPEAKER_09]: I actually used one of my free songs for it.

1540
02:10:21,628 --> 02:10:23,149
[SPEAKER_09]: But here's the thing, it sucks.

1541
02:10:23,729 --> 02:10:24,669
[SPEAKER_09]: It really sucks.

1542
02:10:25,210 --> 02:10:26,070
[SPEAKER_09]: I was so sad.

1543
02:10:26,090 --> 02:10:28,391
[SPEAKER_09]: I was like, good song, good band, this is going to be awesome.

1544
02:10:28,731 --> 02:10:29,072
[SPEAKER_09]: Sucks.

1545
02:10:30,632 --> 02:10:32,393
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, anyway, back to the issue at hand here.

1546
02:10:32,453 --> 02:10:35,095
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's recap the three songs you can vote for tonight.

1547
02:10:36,515 --> 02:10:39,337
[SPEAKER_09]: Song number one, last week's winner, Freeze Pop, Stakeout.

1548
02:10:46,498 --> 02:10:49,880
[SPEAKER_09]: And song number two you can vote for tonight, Filter and the Crystal Method.

1549
02:10:49,941 --> 02:10:50,901
[SPEAKER_09]: Can't you trip like I do?

1550
02:10:50,921 --> 02:10:55,204
[SPEAKER_21]: I do.

1551
02:10:55,224 --> 02:10:56,865
[SPEAKER_21]: Just like I do.

1552
02:10:59,967 --> 02:11:02,088
[SPEAKER_09]: I had to pick the quietest part of that song by random there.

1553
02:11:02,108 --> 02:11:02,349
[SPEAKER_09]: Whoops.

1554
02:11:03,069 --> 02:11:07,412
[SPEAKER_09]: Keka Keka, remixed by DJ Sidarth, is song number three, Urine Uri.

1555
02:11:08,993 --> 02:11:09,933
Urine Uri.

1556
02:11:14,684 --> 02:11:16,585
[SPEAKER_09]: Is that ever going to come out?

1557
02:11:16,645 --> 02:11:18,146
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

1558
02:11:18,166 --> 02:11:18,767
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm starting to worry.

1559
02:11:18,827 --> 02:11:19,507
[SPEAKER_09]: It's still not out.

1560
02:11:19,567 --> 02:11:21,229
[SPEAKER_09]: What in the hell is going on?

1561
02:11:44,989 --> 02:11:49,312
[SPEAKER_09]: Somebody needs to get bitch slapped, and I don't think it's Konami, I think it's somebody at Microsoft.

1562
02:11:49,632 --> 02:11:54,575
[SPEAKER_09]: I guess they're too busy concerning themselves with the Xboxes that caught on fire, or something, I don't know.

1563
02:11:54,895 --> 02:11:56,036
[SPEAKER_09]: Because you heard about this, right?

1564
02:11:57,137 --> 02:12:09,405
[SPEAKER_09]: The Microsoft had to recall the power cords for Xboxes that were made prior to October 2003, because I guess if you leave it on for a prolonged period of time, it will catch fire!

1565
02:12:12,651 --> 02:12:20,416
[SPEAKER_09]: They say it's only a 1 in 10,000 chance, but those types of lawsuits are still a pretty big deal, so they've got to recall, and they'll send you a free power cord.

1566
02:12:20,676 --> 02:12:28,441
[SPEAKER_09]: I got an email on it, although I believe my particular Xbox is immune because it's a Halo Xbox.

1567
02:12:28,501 --> 02:12:29,682
[SPEAKER_09]: I got the Halo Limited Edition.

1568
02:12:29,702 --> 02:12:30,522
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't think it affects these.

1569
02:12:31,723 --> 02:12:34,025
[SPEAKER_09]: I still got an email on it because they suspect it.

1570
02:12:34,045 --> 02:12:34,325
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

1571
02:12:34,345 --> 02:12:35,385
[SPEAKER_09]: I've got to check it out at least.

1572
02:12:36,606 --> 02:12:37,787
[SPEAKER_09]: Any comments on this?

1573
02:12:37,827 --> 02:12:39,308
[SPEAKER_09]: Anything you guys have heard extra on this?

1574
02:12:40,592 --> 02:12:43,417
[SPEAKER_17]: Our first Xbox already died, so it's kinda moot for me.

1575
02:12:46,872 --> 02:12:49,893
[SPEAKER_09]: I guess that's what I hear is that the Xboxes don't last too long usually.

1576
02:12:50,653 --> 02:12:51,574
[SPEAKER_09]: Here's the email I got.

1577
02:12:51,614 --> 02:12:58,456
[SPEAKER_09]: It says, Microsoft has chosen to replace the power cords on Xbox consoles manufactured before October 23, 2003.

1578
02:12:58,716 --> 02:13:01,917
[SPEAKER_09]: Our records indicate that you may own one of these consoles.

1579
02:13:01,957 --> 02:13:03,298
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey, that's me.

1580
02:13:03,378 --> 02:13:05,838
[SPEAKER_09]: Check the manufacture date on the bottom of your console.

1581
02:13:05,898 --> 02:13:09,880
[SPEAKER_09]: No action is necessary if your console is manufactured on or after October 23, 2003.

1582
02:13:11,460 --> 02:13:12,400
[SPEAKER_09]: Now I'm all curious.

1583
02:13:13,141 --> 02:13:13,861
[SPEAKER_09]: Loki's going to look.

1584
02:13:14,975 --> 02:13:16,495
[SPEAKER_09]: Loki's going to go look at that manufacture date.

1585
02:13:18,056 --> 02:13:22,397
[SPEAKER_09]: I thought I bought mine after that, but I guess that doesn't mean it was manufactured after that date, necessarily.

1586
02:13:23,517 --> 02:13:24,038
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll see.

1587
02:13:29,899 --> 02:13:31,019
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what's sad?

1588
02:13:31,160 --> 02:13:33,640
[SPEAKER_09]: That must have actually happened for them to realize it.

1589
02:13:35,161 --> 02:13:35,681
[SPEAKER_32]: What the hell?

1590
02:13:35,781 --> 02:13:36,561
[SPEAKER_32]: April 16th?

1591
02:13:36,901 --> 02:13:39,682
[SPEAKER_09]: Yep, my Xbox was made April 16th, 2004.

1592
02:13:40,362 --> 02:13:41,682
[SPEAKER_09]: I am immune, motherfucker.

1593
02:13:42,563 --> 02:13:43,563
[SPEAKER_32]: That's my birthday.

1594
02:13:44,975 --> 02:13:45,476
[SPEAKER_32]: Is it really?

1595
02:13:45,736 --> 02:13:46,076
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

1596
02:13:46,136 --> 02:13:46,516
[SPEAKER_08]: Right on.

1597
02:13:47,917 --> 02:13:49,579
[SPEAKER_32]: Yeah, that's the exact date of my birthday.

1598
02:13:49,599 --> 02:13:50,359
[SPEAKER_32]: I was like, what the fuck?

1599
02:13:51,040 --> 02:13:51,600
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, that's cool.

1600
02:13:52,060 --> 02:13:52,361
[SPEAKER_32]: Oh, well.

1601
02:13:52,881 --> 02:13:54,502
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I haven't had my Xbox that long.

1602
02:13:55,243 --> 02:13:57,024
[SPEAKER_09]: Because those Halo ones just came out, so.

1603
02:13:59,486 --> 02:14:02,808
[SPEAKER_09]: I should get a new cord anyway, just because they're really expensive otherwise.

1604
02:14:03,369 --> 02:14:05,250
[SPEAKER_32]: Oh, yeah, just get it for free since they're...

1605
02:14:07,642 --> 02:14:10,903
[SPEAKER_32]: You know, fixing the problem, according to what they're saying.

1606
02:14:11,844 --> 02:14:12,624
[SPEAKER_32]: When did this happen, though?

1607
02:14:12,644 --> 02:14:13,664
[SPEAKER_32]: I didn't hear about this.

1608
02:14:14,605 --> 02:14:15,525
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, it's just this week.

1609
02:14:16,325 --> 02:14:18,226
[SPEAKER_09]: Xbox sent out all the emails to people this week.

1610
02:14:18,906 --> 02:14:20,387
[SPEAKER_09]: So, check your Xboxes, kids.

1611
02:14:21,327 --> 02:14:27,609
[SPEAKER_09]: If you have an Xbox that was manufactured before October 23rd, 2003, you better get a new power cord, or there might be a fire!

1612
02:14:27,909 --> 02:14:28,630
[SPEAKER_09]: A bad fire!

1613
02:14:29,570 --> 02:14:30,530
[SPEAKER_32]: Fry-cro-soft.

1614
02:14:31,431 --> 02:14:32,191
[SPEAKER_09]: Fry-cro-soft.

1615
02:14:33,051 --> 02:14:33,331
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright.

1616
02:14:34,612 --> 02:14:34,712
[SPEAKER_09]: Um...

1617
02:14:35,521 --> 02:14:35,921
[SPEAKER_09]: Mario Kart Arcade

1618
02:14:59,730 --> 02:15:00,270
[SPEAKER_09]: Discuss.

1619
02:15:00,290 --> 02:15:01,511
[SPEAKER_09]: Bitches, you all going down.

1620
02:15:01,531 --> 02:15:03,032
[SPEAKER_17]: It's going to have Pac-Man and Ms.

1621
02:15:03,052 --> 02:15:04,833
[SPEAKER_17]: Pac-Man in it, and it's put up by Namco.

1622
02:15:04,873 --> 02:15:06,854
[SPEAKER_09]: Yep, because Namco and Nintendo teamed up for this.

1623
02:15:07,254 --> 02:15:10,476
[SPEAKER_09]: Here's the thing I'm wondering, and it's the thing that I've been wondering a while.

1624
02:15:10,897 --> 02:15:12,077
[SPEAKER_33]: It's on Triforce hardware.

1625
02:15:12,117 --> 02:15:14,239
[SPEAKER_33]: Triforce, three companies.

1626
02:15:14,979 --> 02:15:18,581
[SPEAKER_33]: Namco, Nintendo, and Sega.

1627
02:15:18,701 --> 02:15:19,642
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, Sega being the one.

1628
02:15:19,662 --> 02:15:20,322
[SPEAKER_09]: Where are the Sega characters?

1629
02:15:20,422 --> 02:15:22,223
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, that's a good question.

1630
02:15:23,444 --> 02:15:26,306
[SPEAKER_17]: You know, Sega has better things they could be doing.

1631
02:15:26,626 --> 02:15:28,127
[SPEAKER_17]: Like putting out another Knights game.

1632
02:15:28,999 --> 02:15:30,299
[SPEAKER_09]: Sonic does not get a car.

1633
02:15:30,319 --> 02:15:31,480
[SPEAKER_09]: How much do you want to bet?

1634
02:15:51,701 --> 02:16:01,103
[SPEAKER_33]: This is going to be tied in with either another Mario Kart game that's going to be released for the GameCube or the new console.

1635
02:16:02,903 --> 02:16:12,145
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, because it looks like... Because that was the way F-Zero worked, is that it kind of teamed up with one of the home versions there.

1636
02:16:12,605 --> 02:16:14,365
[SPEAKER_17]: It should be a card game.

1637
02:16:15,465 --> 02:16:16,366
[SPEAKER_17]: You can save your progress.

1638
02:16:18,266 --> 02:16:18,546
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyway...

1639
02:16:19,426 --> 02:16:20,326
[SPEAKER_09]: It looks very cool.

1640
02:16:21,927 --> 02:16:22,827
[SPEAKER_09]: Actually, it does have the card.

1641
02:16:23,227 --> 02:16:25,428
[SPEAKER_09]: And Mario Kart is supposed to have the card system with it.

1642
02:16:25,928 --> 02:16:26,308
[SPEAKER_09]: Very good.

1643
02:16:26,368 --> 02:16:27,208
[SPEAKER_09]: Just like F-Zero did.

1644
02:16:27,928 --> 02:16:28,508
[SPEAKER_17]: You know what?

1645
02:16:28,629 --> 02:16:30,349
[SPEAKER_17]: Huh?

1646
02:16:31,249 --> 02:16:33,890
[SPEAKER_17]: It's very interesting that they're using so many card games now.

1647
02:16:34,210 --> 02:16:39,331
[SPEAKER_17]: You know, back when the Neo Geos were first kind of big... God, I remember those.

1648
02:16:39,351 --> 02:16:40,552
[SPEAKER_17]: They were supposed to have it.

1649
02:16:41,192 --> 02:16:46,853
[SPEAKER_17]: And I remember watching this back on... What was the show?

1650
02:16:47,034 --> 02:16:48,474
[SPEAKER_17]: It was GamePro...

1651
02:16:49,191 --> 02:16:50,132
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, God.

1652
02:16:50,432 --> 02:16:53,414
[SPEAKER_09]: You know the GamePro show was filmed locally here in this area?

1653
02:16:54,455 --> 02:16:55,735
[SPEAKER_17]: I lived in Alabama at the time.

1654
02:16:55,835 --> 02:16:57,476
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, yeah, it was filmed at the Channel 3 studios.

1655
02:16:57,497 --> 02:16:57,997
[SPEAKER_09]: Isn't that weird?

1656
02:16:58,217 --> 02:17:04,881
[SPEAKER_17]: But I remember where you were supposed to have a memory card that worked from your Neo Geo home system to the arcade systems.

1657
02:17:06,162 --> 02:17:06,402
[SPEAKER_19]: Hmm.

1658
02:17:07,163 --> 02:17:08,604
[SPEAKER_17]: Between the MVS and the AVS.

1659
02:17:10,005 --> 02:17:16,729
[SPEAKER_17]: I never... And I actually saw the machine... You know, you can look on the old Neo Geo machines and actually see the card readers on them.

1660
02:17:17,122 --> 02:17:20,864
[SPEAKER_09]: Would it be maybe that that didn't catch on because nobody owned a Neo Geo because of the price?

1661
02:17:20,924 --> 02:17:23,966
[SPEAKER_09]: Now, granted, I know you own a Neo Geo, but you are an exception to the rule.

1662
02:17:24,386 --> 02:17:26,007
[SPEAKER_17]: That's because me and Dan are cool.

1663
02:17:26,707 --> 02:17:28,328
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I mean, you got, man.

1664
02:17:28,348 --> 02:17:30,229
[SPEAKER_09]: It was like cheaper to buy the arcade system.

1665
02:17:30,269 --> 02:17:33,411
[SPEAKER_09]: Seriously, you might as well have bought the arcade system for how much that thing cost.

1666
02:17:33,431 --> 02:17:37,253
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't know, he'll have to correct me on this one, but I think he traded a Sega CD for it.

1667
02:17:37,293 --> 02:17:43,636
[SPEAKER_09]: But that's the thing, is that really that's why it was so damn much, because in a way you were getting the arcade system on your TV.

1668
02:17:43,656 --> 02:17:44,416
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, it was like the same system.

1669
02:17:44,496 --> 02:17:45,517
[SPEAKER_09]: It was the same damn thing.

1670
02:17:47,625 --> 02:17:48,886
[SPEAKER_09]: So, crazy.

1671
02:17:50,287 --> 02:17:53,509
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, we're going to go to a break, boys and girls, so we can tally up the cage match votes.

1672
02:17:53,529 --> 02:17:55,850
[SPEAKER_09]: And when we come back, we're going to get into the FUs of the week.

1673
02:17:55,910 --> 02:17:57,812
[SPEAKER_09]: Please don't send in your FUs of the week just yet, though.

1674
02:17:57,832 --> 02:18:00,093
[SPEAKER_09]: I've got to get the cage match out of the way and then we'll accept those.

1675
02:18:00,413 --> 02:18:01,114
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll let you know when.

1676
02:18:01,670 --> 02:18:08,578
[SPEAKER_09]: So, whoa, excuse me, we will be back after this with more, excuse me, how unprofessional, but when was this show ever professional?

1677
02:18:08,958 --> 02:18:09,619
[SPEAKER_09]: More Orange Entredo.

1678
02:18:09,639 --> 02:18:16,706
[SPEAKER_09]: We're going to start off this break with something Jamie wanted to hear, and I think this is an appropriate song considering the Xbox news we just talked about.

1679
02:18:17,147 --> 02:18:18,028
[SPEAKER_09]: So we'll be back after this.

1680
02:20:32,193 --> 02:20:33,154
Thanks for watching!

1681
02:21:45,146 --> 02:21:45,827
Thanks for watching!

1682
02:22:34,484 --> 02:22:35,047
Thanks for watching!

1683
02:23:30,615 --> 02:23:31,077
Thanks for watching!

1684
02:25:12,208 --> 02:25:17,890
[SPEAKER_14]: Mr. Random Person on the Street, who, by the way, is not an actor, what do you think of the Orange Lounge mainlining music in more shows?

1685
02:25:18,170 --> 02:25:25,293
[SPEAKER_23]: The music is like being transported to just this dancing spaceship place.

1686
02:25:25,653 --> 02:25:27,634
[SPEAKER_23]: It's unearthly.

1687
02:25:27,874 --> 02:25:31,616
[SPEAKER_23]: It's like being at a club, except you don't have to actually ask someone to dance.

1688
02:25:32,456 --> 02:25:34,357
[SPEAKER_09]: We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio.

1689
02:25:36,731 --> 02:25:38,492
[SPEAKER_09]: and we're going to get into the FUs of the week.

1690
02:25:38,512 --> 02:25:41,995
[SPEAKER_09]: But first, boys and girls, I bet you are dying to know who won tonight's cage match.

1691
02:25:44,537 --> 02:25:45,938
[SPEAKER_10]: Tweet, tweet, tweet, tweet.

1692
02:25:46,478 --> 02:25:46,938
[SPEAKER_09]: Chirp!

1693
02:25:47,078 --> 02:25:47,959
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry, we're all dead.

1694
02:25:48,039 --> 02:25:49,180
[SPEAKER_09]: Actually, actually.

1695
02:25:52,022 --> 02:25:52,302
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks.

1696
02:25:53,343 --> 02:25:54,524
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, well, here it is.

1697
02:25:54,624 --> 02:26:02,429
[SPEAKER_09]: Tonight's cage match was so close that only one vote separated a tie between

1698
02:26:03,134 --> 02:26:06,698
[SPEAKER_09]: You look so sweet and clueless You've been moving on my brain for too long

1699
02:26:26,277 --> 02:26:28,419
[SPEAKER_09]: Song number two being one vote behind.

1700
02:26:28,519 --> 02:26:36,044
[SPEAKER_09]: So, in the Orange Lounge rules, it states that the host whose song did not tie gets to break the tie.

1701
02:26:36,145 --> 02:26:39,267
[SPEAKER_09]: So, Jamie, is it going to be Freeze Pop or Keka Keka?

1702
02:26:39,507 --> 02:26:39,967
[SPEAKER_09]: Freeze Pop.

1703
02:26:40,428 --> 02:26:42,709
[SPEAKER_09]: Freeze Pop is the winner once again!

1704
02:26:47,318 --> 02:26:51,619
[SPEAKER_21]: Just because I want to irritate the people who don't like it.

1705
02:26:53,539 --> 02:26:53,939
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright.

1706
02:26:54,879 --> 02:26:57,680
[SPEAKER_09]: Freeze Pop wins for the third week in a row.

1707
02:26:57,760 --> 02:26:58,700
[SPEAKER_09]: Guess what, boys and girls?

1708
02:26:58,900 --> 02:27:06,362
[SPEAKER_09]: If it wins next week, it will be the third song in Orange Lounge history to get retired from the Orange Lounge Cage Match.

1709
02:27:06,382 --> 02:27:13,443
[SPEAKER_09]: The other ones being Gwen Stefani, Whatcha Waitin' For, and Echo Image, Come Back are the two other songs that have been retired.

1710
02:27:15,419 --> 02:27:17,900
[SPEAKER_09]: I can't believe that Gwen Stefani went those whole four weeks.

1711
02:27:17,940 --> 02:27:19,301
[SPEAKER_09]: Have you heard her new single, though?

1712
02:27:19,961 --> 02:27:20,382
[SPEAKER_09]: It's hot.

1713
02:27:20,942 --> 02:27:21,562
[SPEAKER_09]: It's totally hot.

1714
02:27:21,582 --> 02:27:22,883
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm going to put it in the cage match later.

1715
02:27:23,303 --> 02:27:27,045
[SPEAKER_29]: If I was a rich girl... Anyway, sorry.

1716
02:27:28,386 --> 02:27:28,826
[SPEAKER_17]: You know what?

1717
02:27:28,846 --> 02:27:30,107
[SPEAKER_17]: That's from Fiddler on the Roof.

1718
02:27:31,848 --> 02:27:32,268
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay?

1719
02:27:33,369 --> 02:27:34,509
[SPEAKER_09]: It is, but it's awesome.

1720
02:27:34,549 --> 02:27:36,250
[SPEAKER_09]: And in the video, they're all dressed up like pirates.

1721
02:27:37,171 --> 02:27:42,813
[SPEAKER_17]: Why should they be dressed up as pirates for a song that's from... Because it's MTV.

1722
02:27:42,974 --> 02:27:43,554
[SPEAKER_17]: It's from...

1723
02:27:44,384 --> 02:27:47,286
[SPEAKER_17]: and a play about Russian Jews.

1724
02:27:49,667 --> 02:27:50,088
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay?

1725
02:27:53,249 --> 02:27:57,572
[SPEAKER_21]: That's... Has anybody ever seen... I was going to say, is that your girlfriend, Loki?

1726
02:27:57,852 --> 02:27:58,793
[SPEAKER_21]: Fiddler on the Roof?

1727
02:27:59,113 --> 02:28:01,795
[SPEAKER_33]: She would qualify the Russian Jew part, yes.

1728
02:28:05,457 --> 02:28:07,678
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm going to start calling your girlfriend Fiddler on the Roof.

1729
02:28:10,802 --> 02:28:14,846
[SPEAKER_17]: Gwen Stefani now has dropped in my esteem.

1730
02:28:15,386 --> 02:28:16,768
[SPEAKER_17]: But she's cool.

1731
02:28:17,508 --> 02:28:19,490
[SPEAKER_17]: But she's being an idiot.

1732
02:28:20,151 --> 02:28:21,712
[SPEAKER_17]: And I don't appreciate idiots.

1733
02:28:24,374 --> 02:28:24,755
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright.

1734
02:28:24,815 --> 02:28:26,036
[SPEAKER_17]: We need to do the FUs now.

1735
02:28:27,577 --> 02:28:28,038
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

1736
02:28:29,639 --> 02:28:32,942
[SPEAKER_09]: And why is it that we do these FUs of the week every single week?

1737
02:28:33,062 --> 02:28:34,524
[SPEAKER_17]: Because of Gwen Stefani.

1738
02:28:50,494 --> 02:29:01,156
[SPEAKER_17]: Fuck musicians who think they can get away with taking something that was perfectly fine the way it was and completely misinterpreting it in such a horrible way.

1739
02:29:01,796 --> 02:29:03,957
[SPEAKER_17]: Fuck you, Gwen Stefani, right in your ear.

1740
02:29:03,977 --> 02:29:06,077
[SPEAKER_17]: Because your ass isn't good enough.

1741
02:29:07,785 --> 02:29:10,626
[SPEAKER_17]: In fact, your ass is probably... Never mind, I won't say anything else about that.

1742
02:29:10,706 --> 02:29:11,786
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what's ironic?

1743
02:29:12,126 --> 02:29:14,907
[SPEAKER_09]: Is that she's dating a guy from a band named Bush.

1744
02:29:16,448 --> 02:29:18,449
[SPEAKER_17]: And fuck you, Gavin, for dating her.

1745
02:29:21,490 --> 02:29:22,070
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, damn.

1746
02:29:22,110 --> 02:29:23,090
[SPEAKER_10]: Somebody just got told.

1747
02:29:25,691 --> 02:29:28,972
[SPEAKER_09]: That's exactly what your fiancé in the chatroom just said.

1748
02:29:29,032 --> 02:29:30,012
[SPEAKER_09]: Somebody just got told.

1749
02:29:30,613 --> 02:29:30,953
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

1750
02:29:31,453 --> 02:29:33,053
[SPEAKER_09]: That's awesome.

1751
02:29:33,173 --> 02:29:34,594
[SPEAKER_17]: And FU goes to...

1752
02:29:36,235 --> 02:29:40,378
[SPEAKER_17]: See, I drove past an accident yesterday that was caused by an old person driving a car.

1753
02:29:42,359 --> 02:29:49,244
[SPEAKER_17]: They need to make people, once they hit a certain age, take a very strict driving test.

1754
02:29:50,545 --> 02:29:53,807
[SPEAKER_17]: Another SU goes towards idiots who drive SUVs.

1755
02:29:55,108 --> 02:30:02,052
[SPEAKER_17]: I can understand driving an SUV if you have a legitimate need for it, but... Like you go camping every week.

1756
02:30:02,533 --> 02:30:03,413
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, you go camping.

1757
02:30:03,914 --> 02:30:04,454
[SPEAKER_17]: You know what?

1758
02:30:05,014 --> 02:30:05,515
[SPEAKER_17]: Back in the 80s,

1759
02:30:06,638 --> 02:30:07,699
[SPEAKER_17]: Bad Rob Bad Rob Bad Rob Bad Rob

1760
02:30:37,782 --> 02:30:52,455
[SPEAKER_17]: I cannot wait until this is made illegal because it is proven that people in general do not pay as much attention to the road as you would if you were not talking on your cell phone.

1761
02:30:54,456 --> 02:30:58,100
[SPEAKER_17]: You know, first of all, do you drive with your laptop on?

1762
02:30:58,380 --> 02:30:59,901
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay, never mind, there are people who do that.

1763
02:30:59,941 --> 02:31:00,682
[SPEAKER_17]: If I could.

1764
02:31:00,702 --> 02:31:04,165
[SPEAKER_17]: Because people are fucking retards, too.

1765
02:31:05,413 --> 02:31:09,396
[SPEAKER_09]: If we're going to ban cell phone usage, can we ban people who put on makeup while driving then too?

1766
02:31:10,136 --> 02:31:10,657
[SPEAKER_17]: You know what?

1767
02:31:11,157 --> 02:31:15,380
[SPEAKER_32]: I almost got hit with someone driving with a laptop on their lap.

1768
02:31:17,282 --> 02:31:20,764
[SPEAKER_17]: Another thing is just people who think that they need to be one car ahead.

1769
02:31:21,625 --> 02:31:22,125
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, that I hate.

1770
02:31:22,165 --> 02:31:28,770
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh my god, you're a car... And I can understand if the person is actually going 20 miles into the speed limit in front of you, because then they are a safety hazard.

1771
02:31:29,731 --> 02:31:29,951
[SPEAKER_17]: But...

1772
02:31:30,436 --> 02:31:36,678
[SPEAKER_17]: If I'm going, normally I tend to speed a little bit, I drive about 5 to 10 miles over the speed limit sometimes.

1773
02:31:37,938 --> 02:31:44,520
[SPEAKER_17]: But when someone passes me, no, that's just inexcusable.

1774
02:31:45,120 --> 02:31:53,463
[SPEAKER_17]: Nothing is, you don't need to be somewhere in so much of a hurry that you should endanger your lives and the lives of everybody else on the road.

1775
02:31:53,523 --> 02:31:57,804
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't really care about the person driving, because you know what, if they die, that's Darwinism at work.

1776
02:32:00,103 --> 02:32:04,885
[SPEAKER_17]: You know, but when they hurt other people in the process because of their stupidity, that's where I draw the line.

1777
02:32:05,286 --> 02:32:09,648
[SPEAKER_17]: Now, if they decide to run off the overpass into the river and they're the only ones hurt, fine.

1778
02:32:10,368 --> 02:32:10,668
[SPEAKER_17]: You know?

1779
02:32:13,010 --> 02:32:21,514
[SPEAKER_17]: Another thing is, I am bad at this, I am getting better, but I don't ride right up on people's asses.

1780
02:32:22,254 --> 02:32:29,558
[SPEAKER_17]: You know, I do have an issue with my following distance, but I don't drive all the way up on somebody's bumper where it's, you know...

1781
02:32:30,402 --> 02:32:31,463
[SPEAKER_17]: The person in front of me stopped.

1782
02:32:31,603 --> 02:32:32,604
[SPEAKER_17]: I wouldn't have any time.

1783
02:32:33,885 --> 02:32:39,450
[SPEAKER_17]: There was this person who was right on my ass driving home from work the other day.

1784
02:32:40,671 --> 02:32:46,195
[SPEAKER_17]: And I'm just glad that I had good brakes because I actually did have to stop very quickly to avoid hitting an animal.

1785
02:32:47,776 --> 02:32:51,920
[SPEAKER_17]: And the person came very close to running into my rear end.

1786
02:32:52,801 --> 02:32:55,503
[SPEAKER_17]: So I kind of wish that they had so I could, you know,

1787
02:32:56,041 --> 02:32:59,723
[SPEAKER_17]: Make him go through all the hassle of getting worse and, you know, having their insurance rate go up.

1788
02:32:59,803 --> 02:33:02,704
[SPEAKER_17]: But, you know, I had better things to do with my time.

1789
02:33:05,165 --> 02:33:06,185
[SPEAKER_17]: But that's really it.

1790
02:33:06,745 --> 02:33:07,726
[SPEAKER_17]: It's mostly about drivers.

1791
02:33:09,727 --> 02:33:12,268
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, let's go on to Loki.

1792
02:33:12,288 --> 02:33:12,748
[SPEAKER_17]: I have one more.

1793
02:33:13,148 --> 02:33:14,408
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, let's not go on to Loki.

1794
02:33:14,809 --> 02:33:19,370
[SPEAKER_17]: People who think that diet pills are the ways to lose weight, you know how to lose weight?

1795
02:33:19,530 --> 02:33:20,691
[SPEAKER_17]: Get off your ass and work it off.

1796
02:33:23,271 --> 02:33:23,571
[SPEAKER_17]: That's it.

1797
02:33:23,731 --> 02:33:24,072
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

1798
02:33:24,552 --> 02:33:24,872
[SPEAKER_09]: You sure?

1799
02:33:25,813 --> 02:33:26,293
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright.

1800
02:33:26,733 --> 02:33:27,014
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright.

1801
02:33:27,054 --> 02:33:27,394
[SPEAKER_09]: Loki!

1802
02:33:28,855 --> 02:33:29,555
[SPEAKER_17]: You're dust!

1803
02:33:29,695 --> 02:33:30,796
[SPEAKER_17]: Fuck you, dust!

1804
02:33:31,637 --> 02:33:33,498
[SPEAKER_33]: Fuck you, too, my cold.

1805
02:33:34,138 --> 02:33:35,039
[SPEAKER_33]: It sucked.

1806
02:33:35,879 --> 02:33:36,860
[SPEAKER_33]: Still stuffed up.

1807
02:33:37,601 --> 02:33:39,022
[SPEAKER_33]: Been all tired.

1808
02:33:39,722 --> 02:33:40,402
[SPEAKER_33]: No tired.

1809
02:33:40,563 --> 02:33:41,443
[SPEAKER_33]: Tired bad.

1810
02:33:42,264 --> 02:33:46,326
[SPEAKER_33]: And, uh, fuck you to my computer for being broken, cause I'm gonna have withdrawals.

1811
02:33:46,707 --> 02:33:51,530
[SPEAKER_33]: Especially now that I think I've realized that Brad hasn't returned Rantheft Auto's San Andreas yet.

1812
02:33:52,219 --> 02:33:53,740
[SPEAKER_33]: So I don't know what I'm going to do now.

1813
02:33:54,780 --> 02:33:57,681
[SPEAKER_33]: Does that mean I have to finish playing Wind Waker?

1814
02:33:58,061 --> 02:33:59,022
[SPEAKER_33]: I guess so.

1815
02:34:00,562 --> 02:34:04,624
[SPEAKER_33]: And then, finally, the most important one of them all.

1816
02:34:05,324 --> 02:34:06,565
[SPEAKER_33]: Fuck you, Golfland.

1817
02:34:06,705 --> 02:34:08,626
[SPEAKER_33]: Fuck you and your ugly asses.

1818
02:34:09,286 --> 02:34:10,026
[SPEAKER_33]: Fuck you, Keith.

1819
02:34:10,186 --> 02:34:13,427
[SPEAKER_33]: Fuck you, management of Golfland and Roseville Golfland.

1820
02:34:13,527 --> 02:34:17,189
[SPEAKER_33]: Thank you, because, you know, I love to be taxed on my own fucking money.

1821
02:34:18,348 --> 02:34:24,432
[SPEAKER_33]: Let's flashback here to the summer when I got to build a brand new Step Mania cabinet for Golf Land.

1822
02:34:24,472 --> 02:34:30,917
[SPEAKER_33]: I did this as purely as a favor because their sales had sucked, no one was coming to the arcade, the scene had basically died.

1823
02:34:31,438 --> 02:34:33,079
[SPEAKER_33]: So, what was my deal with them?

1824
02:34:33,519 --> 02:34:36,401
[SPEAKER_33]: I would charge them for parts, they would reimburse me the end.

1825
02:34:36,741 --> 02:34:40,344
[SPEAKER_33]: Okay, they would have a wonderful cabinet, I would do all the labor for free, that's it.

1826
02:34:41,725 --> 02:34:47,049
[SPEAKER_33]: So, a thousand dollars later, you know, I have this cabinet that's built here, they go to pay me...

1827
02:34:48,039 --> 02:34:49,501
[SPEAKER_33]: And they're dragging their feet.

1828
02:34:49,581 --> 02:34:54,605
[SPEAKER_33]: They don't want to, you know, they're just like, oh, Keith's never there, oh, the check's on its way, da-da-da-da-da.

1829
02:34:55,145 --> 02:35:05,133
[SPEAKER_33]: So it's been dragging and dragging, and finally I get paid, and then they have the audacity to send me a 1099 for it.

1830
02:35:05,334 --> 02:35:08,676
[SPEAKER_33]: A 1099 for my own money that they were supposed to be reimbursing me for.

1831
02:35:08,756 --> 02:35:09,997
[SPEAKER_33]: Why am I getting taxed on my own money?

1832
02:35:10,478 --> 02:35:10,978
[SPEAKER_33]: Fuck them.

1833
02:35:12,059 --> 02:35:12,580
[SPEAKER_33]: Fuck them.

1834
02:35:13,821 --> 02:35:16,603
[SPEAKER_17]: Um, a 1099 is the one that you pay taxes on.

1835
02:35:17,391 --> 02:35:21,153
[SPEAKER_33]: No, 1099s are the ones they get taxed on.

1836
02:35:21,233 --> 02:35:22,594
[SPEAKER_33]: It's misleading as income.

1837
02:35:23,815 --> 02:35:27,197
[SPEAKER_09]: And... Actually, I think you're meaning a W-2.

1838
02:35:27,837 --> 02:35:28,218
[SPEAKER_09]: No, it's a 1099.

1839
02:35:28,378 --> 02:35:29,538
[SPEAKER_17]: Nobody's writing this a 1099.

1840
02:35:29,578 --> 02:35:30,059
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh, never mind.

1841
02:35:30,079 --> 02:35:31,559
[SPEAKER_09]: You're right, you're right, you're right, you're right.

1842
02:35:31,599 --> 02:35:32,860
[SPEAKER_09]: W-2s are for wages, I guess.

1843
02:35:32,880 --> 02:35:33,981
[SPEAKER_17]: Because they also put out 1099s.

1844
02:35:34,001 --> 02:35:34,641
[SPEAKER_09]: 1099, 1098, and 5498s.

1845
02:35:34,661 --> 02:35:35,041
[SPEAKER_09]: And W-2Gs.

1846
02:35:35,061 --> 02:35:36,883
[SPEAKER_09]: They put out 1099s for return funds for us.

1847
02:35:36,903 --> 02:35:37,403
[SPEAKER_09]: I work in mortgage.

1848
02:35:47,508 --> 02:35:48,991
[SPEAKER_17]: 1099 for foreclosures and bankruptcies

1849
02:35:58,757 --> 02:35:59,577
[SPEAKER_33]: So, taxes.

1850
02:35:59,797 --> 02:36:01,598
[SPEAKER_33]: You know how much that's going to cost me, Golfland?

1851
02:36:01,618 --> 02:36:05,278
[SPEAKER_33]: That's going to cost me $150 out of my pocket for your stupid shit.

1852
02:36:07,719 --> 02:36:08,679
[SPEAKER_33]: Take them to Smokland's court.

1853
02:36:09,319 --> 02:36:10,599
[SPEAKER_33]: It's really not worth it, you know?

1854
02:36:10,839 --> 02:36:11,560
[SPEAKER_33]: It's really not.

1855
02:36:11,620 --> 02:36:13,280
[SPEAKER_09]: A machine, by the way, which no longer operates.

1856
02:36:13,300 --> 02:36:17,341
[SPEAKER_33]: Yeah, the machine's been stolen, it's been converted back, or, you know, whatever.

1857
02:36:17,501 --> 02:36:19,181
[SPEAKER_17]: Take the check to Golfland and make them pay it.

1858
02:36:20,041 --> 02:36:21,702
[SPEAKER_33]: It's not worth it, honestly.

1859
02:36:22,282 --> 02:36:25,362
[SPEAKER_33]: Because it was hard enough to get them to pay for it.

1860
02:36:25,582 --> 02:36:27,003
[SPEAKER_33]: It's not worth my time.

1861
02:36:27,363 --> 02:36:27,863
[SPEAKER_17]: You know what?

1862
02:36:29,358 --> 02:36:31,419
[SPEAKER_17]: I always say it's worth time to prove somebody wrong.

1863
02:36:47,935 --> 02:36:50,377
[SPEAKER_33]: I didn't think to make copies because I didn't think it was going to be a problem.

1864
02:36:50,797 --> 02:37:09,910
[SPEAKER_33]: So anyway, so then, um, so they figured out a way what they were going to do is they were going to make this fake invoice, okay, and make it look like I'm some computer company, and then they were going to give invoices to that so I wouldn't get, you know, charged a 1099 for it, and that was the deal, that was, you know, they made it clear that I wasn't going to get a 1099 for it, and that everything was all good, and I was done.

1865
02:37:10,310 --> 02:37:12,051
[SPEAKER_33]: Well, guess what, they gave me a 1099 anyway.

1866
02:37:12,071 --> 02:37:15,213
[SPEAKER_17]: So you should go into the machine and take back $150 in parts out of the machine.

1867
02:37:17,209 --> 02:37:19,350
[SPEAKER_33]: I can't really do that.

1868
02:37:19,770 --> 02:37:21,691
[SPEAKER_33]: Well, that'd be theft.

1869
02:37:22,991 --> 02:37:23,571
[SPEAKER_17]: I'd pursue it.

1870
02:37:25,392 --> 02:37:27,152
[SPEAKER_09]: So, yeah, they fucked me over again.

1871
02:37:27,792 --> 02:37:30,693
[SPEAKER_09]: Just go in there with a chocolate gun and wave it around.

1872
02:37:33,634 --> 02:37:34,875
[SPEAKER_33]: I sent an email to Keith.

1873
02:37:35,255 --> 02:37:35,975
[SPEAKER_33]: It wasn't very nice.

1874
02:37:36,884 --> 02:37:37,964
[SPEAKER_33]: And, you know, he hasn't responded.

1875
02:37:38,324 --> 02:37:38,785
[SPEAKER_33]: Surprise.

1876
02:37:39,345 --> 02:37:40,265
[SPEAKER_33]: Never ever responds.

1877
02:37:40,365 --> 02:37:41,005
[SPEAKER_33]: So, you know what?

1878
02:37:41,045 --> 02:37:41,365
[SPEAKER_33]: Fuck him.

1879
02:37:42,165 --> 02:37:45,226
[SPEAKER_33]: And I'm officially, you know, I'm boycotting Golfland.

1880
02:37:45,246 --> 02:37:46,566
[SPEAKER_33]: I'm not going back there ever again.

1881
02:37:47,167 --> 02:37:49,407
[SPEAKER_33]: And I would urge everyone else to do the same.

1882
02:37:49,427 --> 02:37:50,988
[SPEAKER_33]: Because they're just going to fuck everyone over.

1883
02:37:51,008 --> 02:37:53,048
[SPEAKER_33]: So, just enjoy it.

1884
02:37:54,428 --> 02:37:56,389
[SPEAKER_33]: I lost, actually, on that cabinet over $230.

1885
02:37:57,529 --> 02:37:58,630
[SPEAKER_33]: So, thank you, Golfland.

1886
02:37:58,850 --> 02:38:02,170
[SPEAKER_33]: You know, this is what I get for doing you guys a favor.

1887
02:38:02,370 --> 02:38:02,951
[SPEAKER_33]: Thanks a lot.

1888
02:38:04,211 --> 02:38:04,471
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm done.

1889
02:38:05,877 --> 02:38:07,397
[SPEAKER_08]: All righty, moving on.

1890
02:38:13,559 --> 02:38:14,699
[SPEAKER_09]: How can I follow that one up?

1891
02:38:14,760 --> 02:38:20,841
[SPEAKER_09]: F you to myself because I have a whole stack of tests to correct and I haven't started yet and I have to have them done by tomorrow morning.

1892
02:38:22,022 --> 02:38:24,922
[SPEAKER_09]: But hey, I got better things to do like play Final Fantasy and WarioWare.

1893
02:38:26,863 --> 02:38:29,003
[SPEAKER_09]: And an F you to WarioWare for being too short.

1894
02:38:29,243 --> 02:38:30,764
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm already like all the way through it.

1895
02:38:32,392 --> 02:38:33,934
[SPEAKER_09]: I really don't have a lot interesting to say.

1896
02:38:33,954 --> 02:38:35,196
[SPEAKER_09]: You need to put the parrots.

1897
02:38:48,533 --> 02:38:49,553
[SPEAKER_09]: The parrot was cool.

1898
02:38:50,053 --> 02:38:54,575
[SPEAKER_09]: And the last unlock I got was a soundtrack thing.

1899
02:38:54,915 --> 02:39:00,097
[SPEAKER_09]: So now I can get Ashley's theme song uninterrupted.

1900
02:39:00,177 --> 02:39:01,757
[SPEAKER_09]: And the theme song for Ashley is cool.

1901
02:39:02,097 --> 02:39:04,598
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'm going to rip the theme song because it's rad.

1902
02:39:06,599 --> 02:39:08,479
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's go to our guest FUs.

1903
02:39:08,659 --> 02:39:11,060
[SPEAKER_09]: I guess we'll start it off with Explicit.

1904
02:39:13,567 --> 02:39:22,029
[SPEAKER_32]: Well, now that I found out that everybody was talking about the FUs already, Jamie was talking about the SCPs, I was supposed to say the same thing, so my FU goes to that section.

1905
02:39:24,130 --> 02:39:28,151
[SPEAKER_32]: And FU to RVGL, I think Loki explained some of that already.

1906
02:39:29,552 --> 02:39:30,412
[SPEAKER_32]: Let's see.

1907
02:39:30,432 --> 02:39:36,434
[SPEAKER_32]: Oh yeah, big FU goes to fucking parents who blame it on the media.

1908
02:39:36,854 --> 02:39:37,394
[SPEAKER_32]: Sorry, sorry.

1909
02:39:39,870 --> 02:39:53,778
[SPEAKER_32]: Okay, an F you goes to parents accusing the media for actions that kids commit all for their own, what they think is a bad influence to kids.

1910
02:39:54,699 --> 02:40:06,586
[SPEAKER_32]: First of all, if you're going to let your kids play stuff like Halo 2 or Grand Theft Auto San Andreas, you should know what the consequences are and tell your kids how...

1911
02:40:09,228 --> 02:40:11,530
[SPEAKER_32]: Don't blame it on the kids, blame it on their parents.

1912
02:40:21,682 --> 02:40:22,763
[SPEAKER_32]: I was about to get there too.

1913
02:40:24,484 --> 02:40:26,404
[SPEAKER_32]: Parents are the most responsible ones for the issues.

1914
02:40:27,865 --> 02:40:29,066
[SPEAKER_32]: My aunt just had a lawsuit with some games.

1915
02:40:29,086 --> 02:40:32,107
[SPEAKER_32]: For some reason, I told her that it's not really worth the lawsuit.

1916
02:40:32,367 --> 02:40:35,368
[SPEAKER_32]: They treat their kids the wrong way.

1917
02:40:47,714 --> 02:40:49,555
[SPEAKER_32]: That's all I'm about to say.

1918
02:40:51,957 --> 02:40:57,561
[SPEAKER_32]: FPU goes to, of course, I've already discussed this before, the Milpius Golf Line issue with pads.

1919
02:40:58,682 --> 02:41:07,888
[SPEAKER_32]: They should have switched it to within the groove pads, and hopefully they make sure that the pads are going to be well for March Madness 2K5.

1920
02:41:09,789 --> 02:41:12,892
[SPEAKER_32]: But to make sure everything calms down, I'll say to be continued for now.

1921
02:41:14,253 --> 02:41:16,274
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright then, Angel's turn to get ranty.

1922
02:41:17,879 --> 02:41:38,919
[SPEAKER_16]: uh, FU to no internet for two days, that sucked, um, yeah, um, and uh, FU to Final Fantasy XI not working, cause that sucks, it black screens right after the play online stuff's over, and I think it might have to do with the last update we just had, so, I don't know what's up with that, so, dammit I wanna play!

1923
02:41:40,621 --> 02:41:42,963
[SPEAKER_09]: Call Squeenix and call him a bunch of fucking fuckers.

1924
02:41:44,599 --> 02:41:46,841
[SPEAKER_16]: Um, maybe.

1925
02:41:49,244 --> 02:41:59,135
[SPEAKER_16]: And, uh, if you had a, like, a, you know, the holiday weekend, because it went too fast again, so, you know, tomorrow's the last day of that.

1926
02:41:59,996 --> 02:42:01,598
[SPEAKER_09]: Be glad you get a holiday weekend.

1927
02:42:01,638 --> 02:42:02,559
[SPEAKER_09]: Sit down, sit down.

1928
02:42:03,476 --> 02:42:04,077
[SPEAKER_16]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1929
02:42:34,564 --> 02:42:35,885
[SPEAKER_09]: One F you for tonight.

1930
02:42:36,705 --> 02:42:39,787
[SPEAKER_09]: F you to the chatroom for teasing me about the way I laugh.

1931
02:42:39,887 --> 02:42:42,169
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't give a flying fuck what you guys say about my laugh.

1932
02:42:42,649 --> 02:42:46,411
[SPEAKER_09]: I laugh the way I wanted to, so in the words of Yoda, up the shut fuck.

1933
02:42:48,132 --> 02:42:48,953
[SPEAKER_09]: Preach on, brother.

1934
02:42:50,322 --> 02:42:54,025
[SPEAKER_09]: RPG King 7 says, first, thanks for reading my FU last week.

1935
02:42:54,185 --> 02:42:54,545
[SPEAKER_09]: You're welcome.

1936
02:42:54,566 --> 02:42:56,487
[SPEAKER_09]: I actually think it would be up the shut fuck.

1937
02:42:58,389 --> 02:42:58,769
[SPEAKER_09]: Shut up.

1938
02:42:59,429 --> 02:43:02,252
[SPEAKER_09]: RPG King 7 says, thanks for reading my FU last week.

1939
02:43:02,332 --> 02:43:02,772
[SPEAKER_09]: You're welcome.

1940
02:43:03,092 --> 02:43:05,975
[SPEAKER_09]: This week, FU to kill stealers in MapleStory.

1941
02:43:07,896 --> 02:43:08,096
[SPEAKER_09]: Ouch.

1942
02:43:09,417 --> 02:43:11,259
[SPEAKER_09]: Elmullet would like to give a playful FU.

1943
02:43:13,420 --> 02:43:18,464
[SPEAKER_09]: F you to Siggy for telling me to call into Orange Lounge Radio now, only to take the spot himself.

1944
02:43:19,084 --> 02:43:22,687
[SPEAKER_09]: Now I feel the need to pwn him at Guilty Gear X to reload again.

1945
02:43:23,871 --> 02:43:24,271
[SPEAKER_09]: Call Squeenix?

1946
02:43:49,864 --> 02:43:54,048
[SPEAKER_09]: F you to EB for not giving me cash back for the game not working so I had to buy something else.

1947
02:43:54,469 --> 02:43:57,612
[SPEAKER_09]: And F you to iTunes for not having real good music available.

1948
02:43:57,952 --> 02:44:07,261
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey, do a search for an iMix called Dance Dance Revolution and it says Orange Lounge Radio's name in the description and it's all a whole bunch of Dance Dance Revolution songs.

1949
02:44:07,862 --> 02:44:09,163
[SPEAKER_09]: I put it together and it's on iTunes.

1950
02:44:09,303 --> 02:44:09,763
[SPEAKER_09]: Look for it.

1951
02:44:10,004 --> 02:44:10,624
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll find a link.

1952
02:44:10,724 --> 02:44:11,305
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe I can find a link.

1953
02:44:12,446 --> 02:44:15,668
[SPEAKER_09]: Miklatov says, first FU of the week goes to gaming expenses.

1954
02:44:16,189 --> 02:44:18,930
[SPEAKER_09]: E3 plus PSP plus Night Style equals poorness.

1955
02:44:19,491 --> 02:44:21,332
[SPEAKER_09]: Second FU goes to my Nintendo DS.

1956
02:44:21,432 --> 02:44:24,494
[SPEAKER_09]: I have two games and they are the only two games I want for the next several months.

1957
02:44:24,894 --> 02:44:27,716
[SPEAKER_09]: Therefore, I may trade it in towards my PSP purchase.

1958
02:44:28,176 --> 02:44:31,659
[SPEAKER_09]: Final FU goes to my car smelling like burning every time I drive it.

1959
02:44:33,480 --> 02:44:36,962
[SPEAKER_09]: Bugged says, FU to no naked hot tubbing this week.

1960
02:44:37,122 --> 02:44:37,883
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm a demubass.

1961
02:44:39,500 --> 02:44:59,558
[SPEAKER_09]: Sephiroth 1215 or 1215 or 1215 says F you to all the snow that is falling right now and an F you for the difficulty being raised all the way up on the DDR machine Illusion says F you to Shakey's not having the regular I got you babe to do karaoke to they had some lame remix with bad synth in it

1962
02:45:00,114 --> 02:45:10,485
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyway, it was totally lame and not gay enough for the incredibly homoerotic I Got You Babe karaoke that I was doing with Larry, a big burly construction worker from the bay that whispers sweet nothings into my ear at night.

1963
02:45:12,487 --> 02:45:12,787
[SPEAKER_19]: Huh?

1964
02:45:14,809 --> 02:45:15,170
[SPEAKER_19]: Huh?

1965
02:45:16,791 --> 02:45:19,174
[SPEAKER_09]: Just a wake up call if you guys are falling asleep there.

1966
02:45:20,359 --> 02:45:24,900
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyway, F you to this week for going by so slow but that it was only four days long.

1967
02:45:25,400 --> 02:45:30,421
[SPEAKER_09]: Illusion says, F you to Gwen Stefani for selling out and her crappy new song that makes me cry.

1968
02:45:32,461 --> 02:45:35,262
[SPEAKER_09]: John Fields says, huge F you to NCSX.

1969
02:45:35,462 --> 02:45:42,483
[SPEAKER_09]: I waited 12 days and you still haven't gotten PlayStation, or PlayStation, Phantasy Star Online Episode 4 in.

1970
02:45:42,863 --> 02:45:43,963
[SPEAKER_09]: I had to go with Hamea.

1971
02:45:44,283 --> 02:45:44,664
[SPEAKER_09]: F you.

1972
02:45:45,144 --> 02:45:47,064
[SPEAKER_09]: Also F you to not having enough hours in a week.

1973
02:45:49,574 --> 02:45:54,097
[SPEAKER_09]: DJ Ranma S says, F you to a friend of mine for being a dick to this girl I know.

1974
02:45:54,177 --> 02:45:57,619
[SPEAKER_09]: Payback's a bitch, cause I'm gonna go for it while you waller in your own self-pity.

1975
02:45:59,140 --> 02:46:00,001
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's have tea!

1976
02:46:00,301 --> 02:46:01,022
[SPEAKER_09]: I love that name.

1977
02:46:01,822 --> 02:46:02,503
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's have tea.

1978
02:46:02,803 --> 02:46:03,203
[SPEAKER_09]: I like tea.

1979
02:46:03,263 --> 02:46:05,485
[SPEAKER_09]: I need tea right now, cause my voice has been hoarse.

1980
02:46:05,565 --> 02:46:06,846
[SPEAKER_09]: That's a very pleasant name.

1981
02:46:07,486 --> 02:46:08,947
[SPEAKER_09]: Which so doesn't work for this segment.

1982
02:46:09,227 --> 02:46:11,729
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'm renaming this person, Let's Have Evil Tea.

1983
02:46:13,210 --> 02:46:13,930
[SPEAKER_33]: You know what would be funny?

1984
02:46:14,010 --> 02:46:14,251
[SPEAKER_33]: What?

1985
02:46:16,052 --> 02:46:17,873
[SPEAKER_33]: Um, well, it's kind of random.

1986
02:46:18,253 --> 02:46:19,274
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, um,

1987
02:46:19,778 --> 02:46:23,240
[SPEAKER_33]: But you know how we were talking about earlier how they have those slash whatevers?

1988
02:46:23,640 --> 02:46:23,880
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

1989
02:46:23,960 --> 02:46:27,422
[SPEAKER_33]: Okay, well, if you're, like, constipated, you can have slash logout.

1990
02:46:34,066 --> 02:46:34,826
[SPEAKER_17]: That was nasty.

1991
02:46:35,506 --> 02:46:35,967
[SPEAKER_09]: I hate you.

1992
02:46:36,747 --> 02:46:41,750
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's Have Tea says, F you to the guy who hit my stepdad's SUV earlier today.

1993
02:46:41,850 --> 02:46:43,010
[SPEAKER_09]: It got flipped and totaled.

1994
02:46:43,891 --> 02:46:45,672
[SPEAKER_33]: That's what you get for having an SUV.

1995
02:46:45,712 --> 02:46:47,352
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey, hey, hey, that's not nice.

1996
02:46:47,392 --> 02:46:48,213
[SPEAKER_33]: He has a...

1997
02:46:49,221 --> 02:46:50,341
[SPEAKER_09]: or it might be a she, sorry.

1998
02:46:50,562 --> 02:46:51,482
[SPEAKER_09]: They have a pleasant name.

1999
02:46:52,582 --> 02:47:02,666
[SPEAKER_17]: I think it was Julie who drove by a wreck where an SUV and like a minivan ran into each other and the SUV rolled and landed on the minivan.

2000
02:47:02,926 --> 02:47:05,967
[SPEAKER_09]: No matter what kind of car you drive, people should... I think about two birds with one stone.

2001
02:47:06,007 --> 02:47:06,567
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, what?

2002
02:47:06,808 --> 02:47:08,928
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, SUVs are so big in the first place.

2003
02:47:08,988 --> 02:47:10,969
[SPEAKER_09]: It has to take a lot of talent to crash into one.

2004
02:47:11,049 --> 02:47:12,190
[SPEAKER_09]: So, I mean, come on.

2005
02:47:13,110 --> 02:47:15,031
[SPEAKER_17]: Tell your dad to like get a real car now.

2006
02:47:16,471 --> 02:47:16,871
[SPEAKER_09]: Stepdad.

2007
02:47:17,151 --> 02:47:18,492
[SPEAKER_09]: One that's got a...

2008
02:47:19,102 --> 02:47:41,657
[SPEAKER_09]: Lower Center of Gravity Legend of Zaku says F you to elements of my school's student body aka the elitists for dropping emo bombs last week over the N word being used in a play in my school that illustrates the horrors of slavery America has a way of driving the point across that slavery was really fucked up back then which is, in my humble opinion, the best way to do it.

2009
02:47:42,197 --> 02:47:46,200
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, I know I'm old, okay, but what the hell is an emo bomb?

2010
02:47:47,290 --> 02:47:48,711
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, you know what emo is?

2011
02:47:48,911 --> 02:47:51,473
[SPEAKER_22]: Emo is that, you know, I'm so sad.

2012
02:47:51,893 --> 02:47:55,336
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm going to slash my wrist because I'm so sad.

2013
02:47:56,456 --> 02:47:58,818
[SPEAKER_17]: It's basically modern goth.

2014
02:47:59,138 --> 02:47:59,759
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, kind of.

2015
02:47:59,799 --> 02:48:01,100
[SPEAKER_17]: Modern goth in happy colors.

2016
02:48:01,360 --> 02:48:01,700
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

2017
02:48:03,341 --> 02:48:07,224
[SPEAKER_09]: So basically it's like the people who bag on movies without seeing them.

2018
02:48:07,264 --> 02:48:12,627
[SPEAKER_09]: Like they bag on dogma for being a satanic movie without realizing that it's actually a pretty religious movie at heart.

2019
02:48:12,888 --> 02:48:14,769
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that's kind of the point Zach was trying to make here.

2020
02:48:15,999 --> 02:48:18,962
[SPEAKER_09]: F you to FreezePop, infecting the ears of Orange Lounge Radio listeners.

[SPEAKER_09]: And F you to tonight's internet connection at my campus, causing major skipping in... And then he got cut off.

2022
02:48:27,390 --> 02:48:33,315
[SPEAKER_09]: Dark Knight says, one F you to Squeenix for making the cutscenes in Star Ocean too darn long.

2023
02:48:34,176 --> 02:48:35,257
[SPEAKER_17]: I have to add another one.

2024
02:48:36,438 --> 02:48:36,698
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

2025
02:48:37,099 --> 02:48:39,601
[SPEAKER_17]: F you to the burning sensation of Liquid Dayquil.

2026
02:48:43,539 --> 02:48:46,940
[SPEAKER_09]: and Let's Have Tea would just like to follow up the ever pleasant Let's Have Tea.

2027
02:48:47,300 --> 02:48:48,981
[SPEAKER_09]: He did get a real car, a Corvette.

2028
02:48:50,621 --> 02:48:51,041
[SPEAKER_17]: Forgiven.

2029
02:48:54,102 --> 02:48:54,542
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright.

02:52:18,623 --> 02:52:23,708
[SPEAKER_09]: We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio, and we're about ready to wrap up tonight's show.

02:52:23,748 --> 02:52:28,592
[SPEAKER_09]: But darn it, it's time for you guys to contribute a little something to this train wreck of a show.

2039
02:52:29,112 --> 02:52:33,316
[SPEAKER_09]: So we're going to do a little bit of Ask Orange Lounge Radio.

2040
02:52:35,575 --> 02:52:37,135
[SPEAKER_09]: And we're playing on the webcam right now, by the way.

2041
02:52:37,175 --> 02:52:38,336
[SPEAKER_09]: I hope you guys are watching over there.

2042
02:52:38,356 --> 02:52:38,876
[SPEAKER_09]: It's kind of fun.

2043
02:52:39,056 --> 02:52:42,317
[SPEAKER_09]: www.orangeloungeradio.com Anyway, let's get into this week's Ask Orange Lounge.

2044
02:52:48,938 --> 02:52:51,839
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's ask Orange Lounge some stupid question.

2045
02:52:52,359 --> 02:52:55,700
[SPEAKER_09]: What will we find out this week on Orange Lounge Radio?

2046
02:52:56,440 --> 02:52:59,321
[SPEAKER_09]: Is there a point to this segment?

2047
02:52:59,841 --> 02:53:00,661
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't think so.

2048
02:53:00,841 --> 02:53:03,002
[SPEAKER_09]: It's only here to fill a little time.

2049
02:53:09,537 --> 02:53:13,300
[SPEAKER_08]: Question from RPGKing7.

2050
02:53:15,082 --> 02:53:20,006
[SPEAKER_09]: Question is, what is everyone in the lounge's opinions of us Canadians?

2051
02:53:21,066 --> 02:53:22,287
[SPEAKER_09]: What do we think of Canadians?

2052
02:53:24,970 --> 02:53:25,830
[SPEAKER_17]: They're from Canada.

2053
02:53:28,633 --> 02:53:31,255
[SPEAKER_09]: I know Loki's thinking of something horrible to say here.

2054
02:53:31,335 --> 02:53:32,696
[SPEAKER_33]: I'm not thinking of anything horrible.

2055
02:53:32,776 --> 02:53:34,517
[SPEAKER_33]: No, honestly, Canadians are cool.

2056
02:53:34,537 --> 02:53:35,298
[SPEAKER_33]: They've got, you know...

2057
02:53:36,125 --> 02:53:42,888
[SPEAKER_33]: Lacks their laws up there, it seems like, you know, and it's just, you know, it's a little cold for my taste, but... It's just cold.

2058
02:53:43,128 --> 02:53:44,789
[SPEAKER_33]: It's just, you know, it's cool.

2059
02:53:44,989 --> 02:53:47,390
[SPEAKER_33]: I mean, I don't have anything wrong against Canadians.

2060
02:53:47,811 --> 02:53:49,231
[SPEAKER_09]: They got the gay marriage thing up there.

2061
02:53:49,271 --> 02:53:50,972
[SPEAKER_09]: They're ahead of the game as far as I'm concerned.

2062
02:53:50,992 --> 02:53:52,353
[SPEAKER_33]: They got that stuff going for them.

2063
02:53:52,533 --> 02:53:54,253
[SPEAKER_09]: But here's my problem with Canada.

2064
02:53:54,314 --> 02:54:01,097
[SPEAKER_09]: If I went to Canada, I'd be out of a job because I work in the healthcare industry, and they got the nationalized healthcare thing going on, so I'd be out of a job.

2065
02:54:01,557 --> 02:54:01,797
[SPEAKER_33]: Well...

2066
02:54:02,537 --> 02:54:07,358
[SPEAKER_33]: The only thing I don't like is French Canadians, but, you know, but that's just because I don't like French.

2067
02:54:07,378 --> 02:54:09,099
[SPEAKER_33]: No one likes French Canadians.

2068
02:54:09,139 --> 02:54:10,499
[SPEAKER_09]: That's not true.

2069
02:54:10,519 --> 02:54:10,959
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm kidding.

2070
02:54:11,119 --> 02:54:17,241
[SPEAKER_33]: So, I mean, there's, there's, hey, you know, Canada gave us Jim Carrey, you know.

2071
02:54:17,261 --> 02:54:18,681
[SPEAKER_29]: And Alanis Morissette, my favorite.

2072
02:54:18,962 --> 02:54:22,343
[SPEAKER_33]: Yeah, well, okay, they gave us Jim Carrey, and, um.

2073
02:54:22,463 --> 02:54:22,963
[SPEAKER_33]: Shut up.

2074
02:54:24,543 --> 02:54:30,805
[SPEAKER_33]: And, and, and they also gave us Tom, oh, wait, no, no, Tom Green, you can have Tom Green back, actually, um.

2075
02:54:32,028 --> 02:54:34,569
[SPEAKER_17]: Dan says, too nice, too close, and too quiet.

2076
02:55:01,127 --> 02:55:05,388
[SPEAKER_09]: The weird thing is they all live in Toronto, which is, I guess Toronto's where it's at.

2077
02:55:06,889 --> 02:55:07,369
[SPEAKER_09]: Go Leafs.

2078
02:55:09,769 --> 02:55:12,510
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, yeah, they have good musicians.

2079
02:55:13,090 --> 02:55:13,931
[SPEAKER_16]: That's all I've got to say.

2080
02:55:15,031 --> 02:55:16,131
[SPEAKER_33]: Shatner's Canadian?

2081
02:55:17,212 --> 02:55:17,772
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, God.

2082
02:55:17,812 --> 02:55:21,313
[SPEAKER_16]: Rob already said Alanis Morissette, so I've got to say Very Naked Ladies, because, yeah.

2083
02:55:22,333 --> 02:55:23,393
[SPEAKER_09]: Or Celine Dion?

2084
02:55:24,273 --> 02:55:24,654
[SPEAKER_09]: Moving on.

2085
02:55:25,234 --> 02:55:26,614
[SPEAKER_33]: Well, the game is Jim Carrey.

2086
02:55:27,854 --> 02:55:28,075
[SPEAKER_09]: I know.

2087
02:55:28,735 --> 02:55:29,695
[SPEAKER_33]: What about Bryan Adams?

2088
02:55:30,274 --> 02:55:38,096
[SPEAKER_09]: Legend of Zaku says, Seeing that you guys are the drinking type, have you ever thought of creating some Bomani-themed cocktail drinks?

2089
02:55:40,917 --> 02:55:50,019
[SPEAKER_09]: My fire, like Goldschlager and... Max 300, Goldschlager, Jägermeister, and 151 all mixed together.

2090
02:55:55,381 --> 02:55:55,761
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

2091
02:55:55,821 --> 02:55:55,961
[SPEAKER_09]: No, I...

2092
02:55:58,127 --> 02:55:58,995
[SPEAKER_32]: Murdoch Survivor

2093
02:56:02,205 --> 02:56:02,705
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

2094
02:56:03,386 --> 02:56:05,847
[SPEAKER_09]: I imagine some dork out there has thought of something.

2095
02:56:06,267 --> 02:56:08,448
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe that's a thread we should start on the forums.

2096
02:56:08,488 --> 02:56:10,089
[SPEAKER_09]: See what people can come up with.

2097
02:56:10,349 --> 02:56:12,590
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, I have a friend who's going to bartending school.

2098
02:56:13,031 --> 02:56:15,812
[SPEAKER_09]: So what I'll do is I will ask him to come up with some new drinks.

2099
02:56:16,092 --> 02:56:17,053
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe he's even listening.

2100
02:56:17,313 --> 02:56:18,433
[SPEAKER_09]: He's starting bartending school this week.

2101
02:56:18,733 --> 02:56:20,614
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll ask him to try and come up with some new drinks.

2102
02:56:21,015 --> 02:56:23,076
[SPEAKER_09]: And when he tells me what's in it, I will give them names.

2103
02:56:23,256 --> 02:56:24,977
[SPEAKER_09]: And we will come up with a Bomani drink.

2104
02:56:25,077 --> 02:56:29,019
[SPEAKER_17]: We could use the one that I made with the orange juice and the Malibu.

2105
02:56:29,099 --> 02:56:29,719
[SPEAKER_09]: I remember that.

2106
02:56:29,759 --> 02:56:30,299
[SPEAKER_09]: That was pretty good.

2107
02:56:30,319 --> 02:56:30,739
[SPEAKER_17]: That can be...

2108
02:56:32,623 --> 02:57:00,698
[SPEAKER_09]: My Summer Love I was thinking the same thing Mikla Tav Dear Ask Orange Lounge Please make some E3 plans Alright, stop bugging me And Boom Boom Dollar was not on DER First Mix Meaning it had no basic step rating Hey buddy It was on US First Mix Which was basically just the Japanese First Mix imported Or 1.5 Mix

2109
02:57:03,175 --> 02:57:07,803
[SPEAKER_09]: MPQ says, why do laptops make shitty gaming PCs?

2110
02:57:08,384 --> 02:57:10,288
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, who has the laptop in her lap?

2111
02:57:10,368 --> 02:57:10,949
[SPEAKER_09]: Care to answer?

2112
02:57:11,570 --> 02:57:13,333
[SPEAKER_17]: I haven't actually tried to run any games on this.

2113
02:57:14,036 --> 02:57:15,518
[SPEAKER_17]: Although I could install the Sims.

2114
02:57:15,618 --> 02:57:28,330
[SPEAKER_17]: Actually, my laptop would probably be very good for gaming because I've got a GeForce in here and I've got a 3.06 processor.

2115
02:57:28,830 --> 02:57:29,171
[SPEAKER_33]: Simple.

2116
02:57:29,371 --> 02:57:32,074
[SPEAKER_17]: And a bunch of RAM.

2117
02:57:32,314 --> 02:57:33,475
[SPEAKER_17]: Mine would run Final Fantasy XI.

2118
02:57:33,855 --> 02:57:36,638
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm going to download the benchmark and see if my laptop would run Final Fantasy XI.

2119
02:57:36,698 --> 02:57:38,039
[SPEAKER_09]: I think you should.

2120
02:57:38,079 --> 02:57:38,700
[SPEAKER_17]: Just so I can laugh.

2121
02:57:39,440 --> 02:57:49,624
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what, I think part of the problem, at least with older laptops, newer ones don't do this so much, but the older ones, like if you change the way you're looking at the screen, it gets lighter and darker, like it's just the way the display works.

2122
02:57:49,684 --> 02:57:50,485
[SPEAKER_09]: It's this LCD screen.

2123
02:57:50,525 --> 02:57:54,206
[SPEAKER_09]: Exactly, and that annoyed the shit out of me, but new ones don't really have that problem.

2124
02:57:54,226 --> 02:57:54,687
[SPEAKER_09]: That's not a problem.

2125
02:57:54,747 --> 02:57:55,087
[SPEAKER_09]: I know.

2126
02:57:55,387 --> 02:57:57,768
[SPEAKER_17]: Mine really won't be running many games though, because it's for school.

2127
02:57:58,308 --> 02:58:03,430
[SPEAKER_33]: The problem is that laptops are generation behind usually, and they're also very expensive.

2128
02:58:03,590 --> 02:58:07,152
[SPEAKER_33]: Also, it says they're passively cooled, they don't have any actual fans inside of them.

2129
02:58:07,632 --> 02:58:07,832
[SPEAKER_33]: and so on.

2130
02:58:32,816 --> 02:58:33,236
[SPEAKER_09]: For the money.

2131
02:58:34,517 --> 02:58:34,838
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright.

2132
02:58:35,959 --> 02:58:36,939
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's see here.

2133
02:58:39,021 --> 02:58:44,586
[SPEAKER_09]: Al Mullet wants to ask, As a future newbie to Beatmania 2DX, there are quite a few songs I haven't heard yet.

2134
02:58:44,986 --> 02:58:46,787
[SPEAKER_09]: What would be your favorites to play?

2135
02:58:47,408 --> 02:58:49,229
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe one favorite song to play in 2DX.

2136
02:58:49,530 --> 02:58:50,771
[SPEAKER_09]: Mine would be Deadline.

2137
02:58:50,931 --> 02:58:53,673
[SPEAKER_09]: As horrid as that song is, I absolutely love that song.

2138
02:58:53,713 --> 02:58:54,514
[SPEAKER_09]: Deadline, Fistyle.

2139
02:58:54,954 --> 02:58:56,756
[SPEAKER_17]: I used to be really fond of playing Sync.

2140
02:58:57,937 --> 02:59:00,799
[SPEAKER_17]: But now it would probably have to be... I actually really dig Holic.

2141
02:59:01,480 --> 02:59:08,142
[SPEAKER_09]: On both levels, so... When you're first getting started and you're still playing 1-stars, Five Fathoms on 3rd style is pretty rad, and it has a random video.

2142
02:59:08,162 --> 02:59:08,942
[SPEAKER_17]: Five Fathoms, that would be the one.

2143
02:59:08,962 --> 02:59:11,302
[SPEAKER_09]: Five Fathoms is like the best song to learn on for 1-star.

2144
02:59:11,322 --> 02:59:16,003
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, it's the one with the DDR in the video, like the old-ass DDR that had Boom Boom Dollar in it.

2145
02:59:17,084 --> 02:59:17,644
[SPEAKER_09]: Mikhail Tov.

2146
02:59:20,384 --> 02:59:22,545
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's see, we got a lot of questions in a little time.

2147
02:59:22,565 --> 02:59:24,405
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm going to try and get through as many of these as we can.

2148
02:59:24,445 --> 02:59:25,886
[SPEAKER_09]: You can still submit some, though, if you want.

2149
02:59:25,926 --> 02:59:26,646
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm looking through some.

2150
02:59:27,493 --> 02:59:32,918
[SPEAKER_09]: John Fields says, Hey Sky, why isn't this show or station listed on the Wikipedia?

2151
02:59:34,260 --> 02:59:36,142
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm somewhat familiar with Wikipedia.

2152
02:59:36,342 --> 02:59:39,284
[SPEAKER_09]: Is that like the user-created encyclopedia?

2153
02:59:39,385 --> 02:59:44,469
[SPEAKER_09]: Kind of like, what do they call that Mozilla database of all the sites?

2154
02:59:44,670 --> 02:59:45,630
[SPEAKER_09]: Free web or something?

2155
02:59:45,650 --> 02:59:46,351
[SPEAKER_09]: Freezilla or something?

2156
02:59:46,371 --> 02:59:48,293
[SPEAKER_17]: I found Mobile Alabama on the Wikipedia page.

2157
02:59:48,753 --> 02:59:49,193
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what?

2158
02:59:49,534 --> 02:59:52,175
[SPEAKER_09]: I just have no idea how to hook something like that up.

2159
02:59:52,615 --> 03:00:00,700
[SPEAKER_09]: If somebody wants to send me an email and tell me how to do it, rob at orangeloungeradio.com or if you just want to submit it, as long as you don't talk shit about us, you have my blessings.

2160
03:00:01,821 --> 03:00:04,522
[SPEAKER_09]: And I imagine DarkSakura and Loki feel the same way, yes?

2161
03:00:05,843 --> 03:00:06,263
[SPEAKER_09]: Whatever.

2162
03:00:06,424 --> 03:00:07,204
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, don't fuck it up.

2163
03:00:07,244 --> 03:00:07,864
[SPEAKER_09]: That's all we ask.

2164
03:00:08,845 --> 03:00:13,888
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's Have Tea would like to know, what is the highest score in Orange Lounge Radio Pinball?

2165
03:00:15,697 --> 03:00:18,941
[SPEAKER_09]: Little known fact, before I got into DDR, I was a pinball whore.

2166
03:00:19,182 --> 03:00:20,163
[SPEAKER_09]: I really loved pinball.

2167
03:00:20,303 --> 03:00:21,404
[SPEAKER_17]: Rob was the pinball wizard.

2168
03:00:21,424 --> 03:00:23,347
[SPEAKER_17]: He was blind and used to be called Tommy.

2169
03:00:26,147 --> 03:00:26,747
[SPEAKER_09]: House of Magic

2170
03:00:50,225 --> 03:00:51,426
[SPEAKER_09]: House of Magic's awesome too.

2171
03:00:51,466 --> 03:00:53,268
[SPEAKER_09]: Those are probably two of the top tables out there.

2172
03:00:53,988 --> 03:01:00,834
[SPEAKER_09]: Another one that I always liked was Pinbot, which is kind of a running joke on Outside the Box when it's actually on the air.

2173
03:01:01,675 --> 03:01:03,317
[SPEAKER_09]: But Pinbot's a really cool one too.

2174
03:01:03,377 --> 03:01:04,117
[SPEAKER_09]: I always liked that one.

2175
03:01:04,257 --> 03:01:06,680
[SPEAKER_09]: And the NES version, not the same.

2176
03:01:06,740 --> 03:01:07,881
[SPEAKER_09]: In fact, it's very much not the same.

2177
03:01:08,361 --> 03:01:09,242
[SPEAKER_33]: What was I going to say?

2178
03:01:09,662 --> 03:01:16,448
[SPEAKER_33]: My favorite time playing, what was it, Invasion of Mars or whatever that one was called, Return to Mars.

2179
03:01:17,668 --> 03:01:19,449
[SPEAKER_33]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

2180
03:01:45,692 --> 03:01:48,173
[SPEAKER_17]: Because I was always really good at hitting the goal.

2181
03:01:51,114 --> 03:02:01,157
[SPEAKER_17]: Dan and I, a little after I first moved out here, we used to go to Godfather's Pizza in Tomas and play Last Action Hero Pinball.

2182
03:02:01,938 --> 03:02:02,398
[SPEAKER_17]: All the time.

2183
03:02:03,538 --> 03:02:06,439
[SPEAKER_09]: Ooh, VXJSXV brings up a good point in the chat room.

2184
03:02:06,879 --> 03:02:09,180
[SPEAKER_09]: Some PC pinball games that were actually really good.

2185
03:02:09,700 --> 03:02:10,441
[SPEAKER_09]: Epic Pinball.

2186
03:02:11,061 --> 03:02:12,782
[SPEAKER_09]: The Epic Pinball games were awesome.

2187
03:02:12,922 --> 03:02:13,762
[SPEAKER_17]: You can get Pin Mame.

2188
03:02:15,094 --> 03:02:16,375
[SPEAKER_09]: Pin Mame's not the same to me.

2189
03:02:16,655 --> 03:02:18,856
[SPEAKER_09]: I would rather play Epic Pinball than Pin Mame.

2190
03:02:18,916 --> 03:02:21,278
[SPEAKER_33]: Epic Pinball I bet's in a band and wear probably right now.

2191
03:02:21,298 --> 03:02:21,858
[SPEAKER_33]: Probably.

2192
03:02:22,319 --> 03:02:29,543
[SPEAKER_09]: As much as I think Pin Mame is an awesome idea and I totally support the project, it just, I don't know, it doesn't work for me.

2193
03:02:29,943 --> 03:02:30,303
[SPEAKER_09]: It doesn't.

2194
03:02:32,085 --> 03:02:36,867
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it's because I prefer the tables that were created for the PC, on a PC, if that makes any sense.

2195
03:02:38,248 --> 03:02:40,810
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't know, there's some really good virtual tables there.

2196
03:02:42,199 --> 03:02:49,200
[SPEAKER_09]: I used to have, and if anybody can think of this and private message me the pinball game that this was, I would love you forever.

2197
03:02:49,800 --> 03:02:57,782
[SPEAKER_09]: There was a pinball game I used to have on my old ass PC, my 100 megahertz PC, and it had four tables in it.

2198
03:02:57,962 --> 03:03:00,062
[SPEAKER_09]: One of them was like a haunted house, I think.

2199
03:03:00,422 --> 03:03:01,842
[SPEAKER_09]: The other one was a raceway.

2200
03:03:02,102 --> 03:03:03,543
[SPEAKER_09]: One of them was a circus.

2201
03:03:04,343 --> 03:03:07,543
[SPEAKER_09]: And I remember the circus table was a demo you could download on the internet.

2202
03:03:07,803 --> 03:03:10,904
[SPEAKER_09]: But then there was another one called like Billion Dollar Game Show or something.

2203
03:03:11,761 --> 03:03:13,382
[SPEAKER_09]: It was a game and it had four tables.

2204
03:03:13,502 --> 03:03:15,203
[SPEAKER_09]: It wasn't Epic, it was some other pinball game.

2205
03:03:15,503 --> 03:03:18,145
[SPEAKER_09]: If I could find that again, I would be so happy.

2206
03:03:18,225 --> 03:03:19,886
[SPEAKER_09]: Did Sierra make a pinball game?

2207
03:03:19,966 --> 03:03:21,006
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't think it was Sierra either.

2208
03:03:21,026 --> 03:03:22,287
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it was some other unknown company.

2209
03:03:23,228 --> 03:03:35,235
[SPEAKER_17]: I talked to one of the people at E3 last year who said that they were working on a pinball game for the PS2 that was supposed to emulate a bunch of the old tables.

2210
03:03:35,817 --> 03:03:42,259
[SPEAKER_17]: I want them to actually go to Capcom and produce the... It was when I had brought up on the show before that Dan showed me there's only like, I think, 16 of them in existence.

2211
03:04:01,420 --> 03:04:01,600
[SPEAKER_17]: Dr. Dude

2212
03:04:32,348 --> 03:04:33,109
[SPEAKER_09]: It was awful.

2213
03:04:36,995 --> 03:04:37,535
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what?

2214
03:04:37,616 --> 03:04:44,505
[SPEAKER_09]: Somebody in the chatroom is posting a suggestion for the game that they think it is.

2215
03:04:45,586 --> 03:04:46,287
[SPEAKER_17]: It was Big Bang.

2216
03:04:46,368 --> 03:04:47,329
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

2217
03:04:48,629 --> 03:04:52,010
[SPEAKER_09]: Hyper 3D Pinball I'm posting pictures of this table in the chat room.

2218
03:05:13,562 --> 03:05:15,163
[SPEAKER_17]: But that's the one.

2219
03:05:15,283 --> 03:05:22,825
[SPEAKER_17]: And they only made a few of them because this was in production right before Capcom's pinball division went out.

2220
03:05:25,686 --> 03:05:26,646
[SPEAKER_17]: I want a pinball table.

2221
03:05:27,946 --> 03:05:29,407
[SPEAKER_17]: I want a Black Knight 2000 machine.

2222
03:05:30,767 --> 03:05:32,868
[SPEAKER_09]: Somebody's suggesting that maybe it's extreme pinball?

2223
03:05:37,329 --> 03:05:40,250
[SPEAKER_09]: And yes, I will... Oh my gosh, I think this is it.

2224
03:05:45,492 --> 03:05:46,272
[SPEAKER_09]: No, I don't think it is.

2225
03:05:46,652 --> 03:05:49,894
[SPEAKER_09]: I think I have that game too, but that's not the one I'm thinking of.

2226
03:05:50,755 --> 03:05:51,155
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyways.

2227
03:05:51,395 --> 03:05:52,215
[SPEAKER_09]: I can't tell.

2228
03:05:52,896 --> 03:05:54,677
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm so upset because I really want this.

2229
03:05:54,697 --> 03:05:55,597
[SPEAKER_09]: You guys don't understand.

2230
03:05:55,657 --> 03:05:56,598
[SPEAKER_09]: I want this game again.

2231
03:06:00,280 --> 03:06:00,720
[SPEAKER_09]: Grr.

2232
03:06:00,920 --> 03:06:01,681
[SPEAKER_09]: No, that's not it.

2233
03:06:01,921 --> 03:06:02,221
[SPEAKER_09]: Darn it.

2234
03:06:02,501 --> 03:06:02,761
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh well.

2235
03:06:03,282 --> 03:06:03,802
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe someday.

2236
03:06:05,231 --> 03:06:06,712
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, let's see.

2237
03:06:06,792 --> 03:06:11,353
[SPEAKER_09]: What we're going to do now is we're going to go around and get everybody's... Oh, I'll do one more question really quick.

2238
03:06:12,354 --> 03:06:13,914
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry to those guys we didn't get to.

2239
03:06:14,014 --> 03:06:15,895
[SPEAKER_09]: Illusion asks, Hey guys, I have a question.

2240
03:06:15,955 --> 03:06:17,456
[SPEAKER_09]: What did you do for Valentine's Day?

2241
03:06:17,496 --> 03:06:18,976
[SPEAKER_09]: Did you get shagged vigorously?

2242
03:06:20,617 --> 03:06:22,278
[SPEAKER_17]: I had chocolate cheese pie.

2243
03:06:25,299 --> 03:06:26,599
[SPEAKER_17]: I had dinner with my boy.

2244
03:06:26,619 --> 03:06:30,981
[SPEAKER_17]: And then I went to school on actual Valentine's Day.

2245
03:06:35,259 --> 03:06:40,120
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, I made pasta, and then it got shagged vigorously.

2246
03:06:42,280 --> 03:06:45,801
[SPEAKER_09]: I did not get shagged vigorously this Valentine's Day, but that's okay.

2247
03:06:46,781 --> 03:06:48,321
[SPEAKER_09]: I can deal with rejection.

2248
03:06:51,162 --> 03:06:53,282
[SPEAKER_09]: It's time to go around and get everybody's final thought.

2249
03:06:53,342 --> 03:06:55,523
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you guys for tuning in to Orange Lounge Radio tonight.

2250
03:06:55,603 --> 03:06:57,683
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's start it off with Explicit.

2251
03:06:57,723 --> 03:06:59,103
[SPEAKER_09]: Your final thought, please.

2252
03:06:59,663 --> 03:07:00,764
[SPEAKER_32]: Jamie, get well soon.

2253
03:07:02,524 --> 03:07:03,364
[SPEAKER_09]: Angel, your final thought.

2254
03:07:04,741 --> 03:07:06,563
[SPEAKER_16]: Final Fantasy must workie, dang it.

2255
03:07:08,224 --> 03:07:09,145
[SPEAKER_09]: Loki, your final thought.

2256
03:07:11,127 --> 03:07:13,008
[SPEAKER_33]: I'm only down to two PCs now.

2257
03:07:13,429 --> 03:07:14,169
[SPEAKER_33]: What am I to do?

2258
03:07:16,611 --> 03:07:20,775
[SPEAKER_09]: My final thought is when will Outside the Box return?

2259
03:07:20,815 --> 03:07:21,396
[SPEAKER_09]: Nobody knows.

2260
03:07:22,637 --> 03:07:23,798
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, your final thought.

2261
03:07:24,618 --> 03:07:26,760
[SPEAKER_17]: I want a Black Knight 2000 pinball machine.

2262
03:07:28,522 --> 03:07:29,222
[SPEAKER_09]: That's it, guys.

2263
03:07:29,242 --> 03:07:30,063
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks for tuning in.

2264
03:07:30,103 --> 03:07:31,865
[SPEAKER_09]: Check out our podcast, dammit.

2265
03:07:33,103 --> 03:07:36,224
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, you can have tonight's final word.

2266
03:07:36,244 --> 03:07:37,045
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh, final word.

2267
03:07:38,245 --> 03:07:47,309
[SPEAKER_05]: The final word of the evening is... That does it for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio Live.

2268
03:07:48,129 --> 03:07:52,331
[SPEAKER_05]: Orange Lounge Radio Live is an Orange Lounge Radio production.

2270
03:08:01,152 --> 03:08:05,114
[SPEAKER_05]: And now, here is your fortune cookie message of the day.

2271
03:08:34,050 --> 03:08:41,065
[SPEAKER_01]: And now, the six merry murderesses of the Cook County Jail in their rendition of The Cell.Tales

2272
03:09:08,599 --> 03:09:34,688
[SPEAKER_21]: Popsic Wishes Popsic Wishes He had it coming, he had it coming He only had himself to blame If you'd have been there, if you'd have seen it I bet you you would have done the same Popsic Wishes Popsic Wishes

2273
03:09:40,401 --> 03:09:43,262
[SPEAKER_11]: You know how people have these little habits that get you down?

2274
03:09:43,982 --> 03:09:45,603
[SPEAKER_11]: Like, Bernie.

2275
03:09:46,163 --> 03:09:47,624
[SPEAKER_11]: Bernie likes to chew gum.

2276
03:09:48,324 --> 03:09:49,185
[SPEAKER_11]: No, not chew.

2277
03:09:50,005 --> 03:09:50,605
[SPEAKER_11]: Ha.

2278
03:09:51,606 --> 03:09:56,128
[SPEAKER_11]: So I came home this one day and I'm really irritated and I'm looking for a little bit of sympathy.

2279
03:09:56,528 --> 03:10:00,790
[SPEAKER_11]: And there's Bernie, lying on the couch, drinking a beer and chewing.

2280
03:10:00,910 --> 03:10:02,451
[SPEAKER_11]: No, not chewing.

2281
03:10:04,450 --> 03:10:10,892
[SPEAKER_11]: And he did.

2282
03:10:11,793 --> 03:10:20,195
[SPEAKER_11]: So I took the shotgun off the wall and I fired two warning shots into his head.

2283
03:10:21,255 --> 03:10:22,396
[SPEAKER_11]: He had it coming.

2284
03:10:22,616 --> 03:10:23,256
[SPEAKER_11]: He had it coming.

2285
03:10:42,640 --> 03:10:46,022
[SPEAKER_24]: I met Ezekiel Young from Salt Lake City about two years ago.

2286
03:10:46,542 --> 03:10:47,823
[SPEAKER_24]: And he told me he was single.

2287
03:10:48,463 --> 03:10:49,844
[SPEAKER_24]: And we hit it off right away.

2288
03:10:50,405 --> 03:10:51,645
[SPEAKER_24]: So we started living together.

2289
03:10:52,246 --> 03:10:53,746
[SPEAKER_24]: He'd go to work, he'd come home.

2290
03:10:54,347 --> 03:10:56,428
[SPEAKER_24]: I'd fix him a drink, we'd have dinner.

2291
03:10:57,269 --> 03:10:58,589
[SPEAKER_24]: And then I found out.

2292
03:10:59,970 --> 03:11:00,911
[SPEAKER_24]: Single, he told me.

2293
03:11:01,551 --> 03:11:02,932
[SPEAKER_24]: Single, my ass.

2294
03:11:03,492 --> 03:11:04,733
[SPEAKER_24]: Not only was he married.

2295
03:11:05,213 --> 03:11:05,613
[SPEAKER_24]: Oh, no.

2296
03:11:06,214 --> 03:11:07,434
[SPEAKER_24]: He had six wives.

2297
03:11:08,475 --> 03:11:09,576
[SPEAKER_24]: One of those Mormons, you know.

2298
03:11:10,879 --> 03:11:15,482
[SPEAKER_24]: So that night when he came home from work, I fixed him his drink, as usual.

2299
03:11:17,663 --> 03:11:21,064
[SPEAKER_24]: You know, some guys just can't hold their arsenic.

2300
03:11:22,005 --> 03:11:27,688
[SPEAKER_21]: He had it coming, he had it coming, he took the power and it was right.

2301
03:11:27,788 --> 03:11:32,931
[SPEAKER_21]: And then he used it, and he abused it, it was a murder, another microchip.

2302
03:11:37,841 --> 03:11:42,745
[SPEAKER_28]: Now I'm standing in the kitchen, carving up the chicken for dinner, minding my own business.

2303
03:11:43,186 --> 03:11:45,648
[SPEAKER_28]: In storms my husband, Wilbur, in a jealous rage.

2304
03:11:46,448 --> 03:11:47,950
[SPEAKER_28]: You've been screwing the milkman, he said.

2305
03:11:48,370 --> 03:11:49,211
[SPEAKER_28]: He was crazy.

2306
03:11:49,671 --> 03:11:52,233
[SPEAKER_28]: And he kept on screaming, you've been screwing the milkman.

2307
03:11:53,134 --> 03:11:54,695
[SPEAKER_28]: And then he ran into my knife.

2308
03:11:55,556 --> 03:11:57,718
[SPEAKER_28]: He ran into my knife ten times.

2309
03:12:07,208 --> 03:12:08,409
[SPEAKER_25]: Yeah, but did you do it?

2310
03:12:08,429 --> 03:12:08,529
[SPEAKER_25]: Uh-uh.

2311
03:12:08,549 --> 03:12:08,909
[SPEAKER_25]: Not guilty.

2312
03:12:38,951 --> 03:12:41,253
[SPEAKER_12]: My sister Veronica and I had this double act.

2313
03:12:41,933 --> 03:12:43,795
[SPEAKER_12]: And my husband Charlie traveled around with us.

2314
03:12:44,715 --> 03:12:49,158
[SPEAKER_12]: Now for the last number in our act, we did these 20 acrobatic tricks in a row.

2315
03:12:49,178 --> 03:12:54,362
[SPEAKER_12]: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, splits, spread eagles, backflips, flip flops, one right after the other.

2316
03:12:55,305 --> 03:13:02,434
[SPEAKER_12]: So this one night before the show, we're down at the Hotel Cicero, the three of us boozing, having a few laughs.

2317
03:13:03,435 --> 03:13:06,359
[SPEAKER_12]: And we run out of ice, so I go out to get some.

2318
03:13:06,840 --> 03:13:09,023
[SPEAKER_12]: I come back, open the door.

2319
03:13:10,229 --> 03:13:15,955
[SPEAKER_12]: and there is Veronica and Charlie doing number 17, the Sporad Eagle.

2320
03:13:17,557 --> 03:13:19,579
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, I was in such a state of shock.

2321
03:13:20,119 --> 03:13:21,281
[SPEAKER_12]: I completely blacked out.

2322
03:13:21,341 --> 03:13:22,442
[SPEAKER_12]: I can't remember a thing.

2323
03:13:23,062 --> 03:13:28,228
[SPEAKER_12]: It wasn't until later when I was washing the blood off my hands, I even knew they were dead.

2324
03:13:29,249 --> 03:13:30,250
[SPEAKER_12]: They had it coming.

2325
03:13:30,290 --> 03:13:31,111
[SPEAKER_12]: They had it coming.

2326
03:13:31,131 --> 03:13:32,172
[SPEAKER_21]: They had it coming.

2327
03:13:35,018 --> 03:13:36,800
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you for watching!

2328
03:14:01,512 --> 03:14:03,833
[SPEAKER_27]: I loved Al Lipschitz more than I could possibly say.

2329
03:14:04,453 --> 03:14:05,874
[SPEAKER_27]: He was a real artistic guy.

2330
03:14:06,554 --> 03:14:07,115
[SPEAKER_27]: Sensitive.

2331
03:14:07,695 --> 03:14:08,175
[SPEAKER_27]: A painter.

2332
03:14:08,975 --> 03:14:10,756
[SPEAKER_27]: But he was always trying to find himself.

2333
03:14:11,357 --> 03:14:19,541
[SPEAKER_27]: He'd go out every night looking for himself, and on the way, he found Ruth, Gladys, Rosemary, and Irvings.

2334
03:14:20,444 --> 03:14:22,686
[SPEAKER_27]: I guess you could say we broke up because of artistic differences.

2335
03:14:23,607 --> 03:14:27,230
[SPEAKER_27]: He saw himself as alive, and I saw him dead.

2336
03:14:59,716 --> 03:15:01,537
[SPEAKER_21]: You popped that gum one more time.

2337
03:15:01,577 --> 03:15:03,937
[SPEAKER_21]: Number 17, the spread eagle.

2338
03:15:04,017 --> 03:15:04,277
[SPEAKER_21]: Pop.

2339
03:15:04,317 --> 03:15:04,497
[SPEAKER_21]: Six.

2340
03:15:04,517 --> 03:15:04,858
[SPEAKER_21]: Squish.

2341
03:15:04,878 --> 03:15:05,078
[SPEAKER_21]: Uh-uh.

2342
03:15:05,098 --> 03:15:05,278
[SPEAKER_21]: Cicero.

2343
03:15:29,531 --> 03:15:33,043
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you very much for listening and we'll see you next week.

2344
03:16:03,106 --> 03:16:03,946
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, we figured it out.

2345
03:16:04,026 --> 03:16:06,687
[SPEAKER_09]: It's either Pinball Dreams or Pinball Fantasies.

2346
03:16:06,727 --> 03:16:08,208
[SPEAKER_09]: They're both made by the same developer.

2347
03:16:08,228 --> 03:16:08,928
[SPEAKER_09]: They're very similar.

2348
03:16:08,948 --> 03:16:10,168
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'm going to check them both out.

2349
03:16:10,548 --> 03:16:11,989
[SPEAKER_09]: That was it, though.

2350
03:16:12,089 --> 03:16:14,730
[SPEAKER_09]: When I do the image search in Google, I get the images of the game I remember.

2351
03:16:15,050 --> 03:16:18,711
[SPEAKER_09]: So, thank you, Jason, for helping me find that out.

2352
03:16:19,111 --> 03:16:19,831
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'm very happy.

2353
03:16:20,151 --> 03:16:22,352
[SPEAKER_09]: It's either Pinball Dreams or Pinball Fantasies.

2354
03:16:22,572 --> 03:16:23,633
[SPEAKER_09]: One is the sequel to the other.

2355
03:16:24,473 --> 03:16:25,173
[SPEAKER_09]: So, that was it.

2356
03:16:25,193 --> 03:16:26,874
[SPEAKER_17]: Now people can help me find Konami World.

2357
03:16:26,914 --> 03:16:27,474
[SPEAKER_17]: I'll be happy.

2358
03:16:27,514 --> 03:16:29,975
[SPEAKER_09]: This is the cool thing about Pinball Dreams and Pinball Fantasies.

2359
03:16:31,455 --> 03:16:32,396
[SPEAKER_09]: Excuse me, I choked on a peanut.

2360
03:16:32,796 --> 03:16:34,577
[SPEAKER_09]: They use mod music.

2361
03:16:34,857 --> 03:16:37,138
[SPEAKER_09]: The music is all mod files, which is awesome.

2362
03:16:38,099 --> 03:16:39,419
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, good luck finding Konami World.

2363
03:16:40,080 --> 03:16:40,520
[SPEAKER_09]: Miss Jamie.

2364
03:16:42,261 --> 03:16:43,322
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, that's gonna do it.

2365
03:16:43,342 --> 03:16:46,984
[SPEAKER_09]: We're gonna log off now so we can take care of that podcast.

2366
03:16:47,304 --> 03:16:47,764
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you guys.
