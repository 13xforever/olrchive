523844	525044	You might know me as Sky.
525765	528005	And yes, I'm futzing with the volume levels as we speak.
528045	528566	Sorry about that.
528606	530707	The volume levels were a little off when we started tonight.
531247	532047	I'm sorry about that.
532747	534148	Our whole pre-show was kind of quiet.
534168	534988	Nobody said anything.
535608	536009	My bad.
536609	536829	Oh well.
537506	539347	Joining me as always are my awesome co-hosts.
539527	541308	In this corner, the happiest bunny on the farm.
541368	544009	Say hello to DarkSakura, a.k.a.
544049	544649	Jamie Summers.
545870	546890	I'm caffeinated today.
547070	547791	God, that's loud.
547991	549591	Wow, your mic is loud today.
550512	551892	Yeah, that's too loud for me.
551932	552713	That's a first.
552893	553233	Dang.
553513	556794	I wonder if we had to turn it up last week because somebody else was there last week.
556975	558615	I don't see how.
559336	560336	I hate sounding echoey.
560816	561637	Yeah, that is kind of weird.
561657	562437	I wonder what's going on with that.
562457	564178	We'll change that.
564698	566239	That's weird.
566379	566999	Okay, well.
567711	568412	Yeah, it is kind of weird.
568432	569132	She sounds echoey.
569893	571154	Turn down her gain a little bit.
571174	572174	I think it's just her gain's up.
573535	574456	Gain?
575417	575917	Stop it.
578419	579800	Um, okay.
580541	583263	Well, say hello to Techmaster Loki while we're at it, I guess.
584043	586465	Hi, I'm fixing stuff.
587166	589327	I can't tell what microphone this is.
590248	591729	In beautiful Orange Lounge fashion.
592449	594431	Can't tell which wire's which in this place.
594915	596696	I don't know what's on move.
596916	598657	Play with all of them until it changes.
598717	599117	I don't know.
599298	600018	Oh wait, here we go.
600158	602459	I think this is it.
602479	602960	There you go.
604240	605241	It does sound echo-y, though.
605861	606582	Well, I don't know.
607782	608463	It sounds better now.
608783	610044	Stop speaking with an echo, then.
613706	616447	Apparently I'm an orange chef.
618068	620950	Say hello also to frequent guests of our program.
620970	621910	She's here again tonight.
621950	623071	Say hello to DDR Angel.
624895	625235	Hello.
627257	631180	Um... I just gave something to Robin.
631220	632441	All of a sudden he goes, ooh!
632661	634402	And I just completely lost my train of thought.
634763	635203	Wonderful!
635703	638145	DDR Angel knows how to kiss some ass around here.
638205	647752	She's brought me a bunch of Pepsi bottle caps that have the iTunes songs on them because she knows I'm like one of the only people that actually uses iTunes and actually purchases songs legally through iTunes.
648113	650354	So she's giving me free songs!
650575	651195	I'm so excited.
652236	653657	And then she's also brought me candy.
655117	656838	That is the best way to my heart.
656918	657578	Music and candy.
657638	658718	Have meat and caffeine.
659719	660759	Well, that works for you.
661639	662600	Meat and caffeine.
664040	665241	And I'm music and candy.
665641	666421	What would Loki be?
668202	668942	Blood and guts.
669722	670022	Maybe.
670282	670782	And porn.
671943	673623	And cooking, because that's what he's doing right now.
674044	675944	In fact, he's got our webcam in the kitchen.
675984	677205	What the hell?
677445	682687	www.orangeloungeradio.com Click on... Actually, you don't have to click on anything.
682707	683947	The webcam's right there on the front page.
685006	688368	And you can watch Loki cook, as exciting as that must be.
688408	689249	I have no idea why.
689429	690910	Why is the webcam in the kitchen?
691230	697875	Is this in response to the people always saying, You guys never have anything interesting on your webcam.
698155	700396	Your webcam is so boring.
701197	701877	Why do you even bother?
701897	709322	It's because there's, I mean, we only have one guest, Angel, I mean, and she's not even sitting on the couch, and so, you know, figured, what the hell.
710363	712684	I'll bring another old school game next weekend to showcase.
713004	713805	Okay, that'll work.
714346	716307	I'll bring like the SNES and play Punch Out.
717108	717448	Awesome.
718548	723811	Actually, we broke out the PS1 today because we found that Nan's been playing Tempest X all day.
724171	724692	That's awesome.
725492	727693	As in the kind of crappy version of Tempest 2000.
729494	730895	Tempest is Tempest, my friend.
731776	734437	Although Tempest 2000 on the Jag was the best.
734697	735938	No, on the Saturn.
738079	741221	Tempest on the Jag was the only game worth getting a Jag for.
741241	741781	What about Defender 2000?
741821	741881	Bah.
744369	745090	No, there was another.
745130	746371	There was Alien vs. Predator.
748193	748773	I guess so.
748993	749514	I guess so.
750375	754418	That's about the only Aliens vs. Predator thing worth even remotely wasting your time with.
754438	754939	The arcade game?
755659	756300	Any arcade game.
756460	756660	Yeah.
756921	757601	But not the movie.
759263	759923	That was my point.
759983	760324	Not the movie.
760344	760984	The comics were okay.
761405	761685	Anyway.
762906	763206	Yeah.
764047	767130	We're here for the next three hours, you know, to talk about, you know, stuff.
769212	769752	How was your week?
769772	770273	How was your day?
770313	778836	And all your favorite segments, Cage Match, and maybe some Bomani news too, and if we run out of Bomani stuff, I guess we'll talk about other video game stuff, because we're dorks.
780737	785620	We're going to start off this break with a potpourri of Bomani music.
785720	786880	There is no theme this break.
787060	788301	We're just going to play whatever the hell we want.
788701	791302	We'll start off with a song I want to hear, Shiny Disco Balls.
791762	794103	We'll be back after this with more Orange Lounge Radio, episode 132.
794143	795104	Thanks for tuning in.
805634	806756	Thanks for watching!
993095	993715	Thanks for watching!
1083631	1084503	Thanks for watching!
1139164	1140247	Thank you for watching!
1162273	1163134	Thanks for watching!
1205962	1207723	Listen to Orange Lounge Radio.
1207923	1210464	Because Bongo demands it.
1213046	1215607	We are back here with more Orange Lounge Radio.
1215667	1220310	Hello, boys and girls, on this happy 220-2005.
1221490	1223291	That's a lot of twos and a lot of zeros.
1223932	1225012	Yeah.
1226093	1226413	I don't know.
1226893	1228074	I'm out of clever things to say.
1228114	1229655	There's a lot of zeros in the world.
1229815	1231176	Oh, you're not so echoey anymore.
1231216	1231956	You're echoing away.
1231996	1233297	Yeah, but I'm still sniffy.
1233637	1233757	Oh.
1234372	1236273	I know, there's been like disease going around.
1236433	1240515	No, it's called, someone decided to clean the upstairs room while I was in it.
1240835	1241255	Oh, okay.
1242015	1242696	Yeah.
1242756	1244236	And there was like a thick layer of dust?
1244756	1245797	Yeah, it's pretty bad.
1246157	1246857	Alright, well, yeah.
1246917	1249718	It needed doing, I just was upset at the time.
1249738	1251439	I'm scared of moving out of this place.
1251459	1254240	You know the Orange Lounge Radio studio is moving in April.
1255261	1258722	So, hopefully you'll have less of a drive to get to the Orange Lounge studio, Jamie.
1259943	1260323	Hopefully.
1260595	1261837	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1276343	1276723	DarkSakura
1305871	1307791	I don't even remember what I did last weekend.
1308392	1309572	I know I had to do something.
1310312	1312913	Oh yeah, it was celebrating Valentine's Day.
1313693	1314373	I'm so bad.
1317373	1319354	Didn't you say the man was listening tonight too?
1319414	1320434	Yeah, I did.
1320954	1321314	Whoops!
1321334	1322675	Whoops!
1322755	1324675	Seriously though, we went to Claim Jumper for dinner.
1325035	1325515	Oh, that's awesome.
1325535	1327096	And ate like everything in sight.
1327196	1327756	That's awesome.
1327956	1329556	And I had chocolate cream cheese pie.
1329576	1331757	I wish I was in a relationship so I could go to Claim Jumper.
1331957	1332977	You can go to Claim Jumper anyway.
1333217	1333737	I know, but.
1334633	1334973	www.DarkSakura.com
1365669	1366369	I was a fool.
1366970	1368170	And they gave me a free cup of soup.
1369230	1373132	Dan got, like, for his appetizer, he got, like, chili in the bread bowl.
1373912	1376433	And I'm sitting here with my little cup of soup going, huh, soup.
1377234	1379775	I'm sitting there staring at his bowl and eating part of it.
1379835	1382976	And it's like, there's no point you should be sitting there staring at his food here.
1382996	1383476	Have another cup.
1383496	1384877	I was like, thank you.
1384977	1385757	You get a good tip.
1385897	1386517	Oh, that's nice.
1386897	1390659	Claim Jumper has the best potato cheddar soup in the world.
1390859	1391739	In the world.
1391759	1392800	It has pieces of...
1393803	1396764	of slightly overcooked potato skin in it.
1397325	1397905	So it's crunchy.
1398125	1400206	For those who don't know what Claim Jumper is, because they don't have it everywhere.
1400226	1401707	I think they only have it... I think it's only in California.
1401927	1404768	Well, I think it's in other states, too, but mostly on the West Coast.
1404808	1405268	I'm not sure.
1405728	1407369	But I know they don't have it everywhere.
1407429	1411231	But basically, it's this giant log cabin-themed restaurant.
1411451	1415213	But the portions are like they kill the buffalo out back and put it on your plate.
1415293	1415933	I mean, seriously.
1415953	1417254	That's how big it is.
1418814	1421335	I didn't really do anything too Bimani-related.
1421395	1422356	I played some Silent Hill 3.
1423649	1426570	Silent Hill 4 is sort of, eh, creepy.
1427171	1428311	Just sort of annoying creepy.
1429192	1431973	Silent Hill 3 starts off like shit your pants creepy.
1433253	1435194	I screamed like a girl at one part of Silent Hill 4.
1435755	1437395	It's a different kind of scare, I think.
1437415	1442438	Silent Hill 3, I only got as far as the first part of it, the dream part.
1443698	1449321	But it was like, you know what, the Uzi in that game is so ridiculously not useful.
1449912	1450993	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1467660	1496626	but in Silent Hill you don't have enough ammo to kill everything you have to be all Metal Gear Solid about it and you gotta sneak by zombies and just run like hell but that is so not the way I usually play adventure games I want to explore every little corner I want to kill everything because I might drop something I need but that's not the same mindset you can approach I wasn't spoiling shit stop saying I spoiled anything don't listen to that Sharon anyway Dan bought me roses
1497678	1500280	I came home from work the other day, and there were roses.
1500601	1504144	Wait, now, I believe, and I could find this, too, in an earlier podcast.
1504164	1505185	You said something, too.
1505265	1509488	I remember in one of the podcasts, you said, I don't need roses, not flowery girl shit.
1509528	1510789	My man buys me Silent Hill.
1511310	1516654	Well, I'm really not very, you know, girly-girly when it comes to relationships.
1516674	1519977	But every so often, you know, I want something sweet.
1520057	1524541	You know, I have to have my dose of sugar in the relationship, or else I start, you know...
1525128	1532090	I'm getting lethargic, you know, without something to keep my, I guess, relationship blood sugar up or something.
1532150	1533471	You can't use Splenda for that.
1533591	1534131	No Splenda.
1535071	1542294	So, he came home and gave me this box, this really long box, and I'm thinking, oh, well, it's got like a poster in it or something.
1542894	1545255	And there were, there's a dozen pink roses in it.
1545855	1546515	Aww.
1546775	1547496	Aww, I know.
1549339	1551520	I feel all spoiled and special.
1551760	1552740	You are spoiled.
1553080	1553500	That's alright.
1555360	1556881	Thank you.
1556981	1560962	If you weren't spoiled, you wouldn't bring that same charm to this show, I don't think.
1561122	1561582	No, you would.
1562102	1562902	You'd be charming either way.
1563062	1563282	Rob.
1563582	1565483	What?
1566583	1566863	Shut up.
1568363	1568583	Rob.
1569383	1570464	Rob.
1571504	1572224	Rob.
1573104	1574284	You can stop shutting up now.
1574444	1574705	Okay.
1574905	1575105	Hi.
1575265	1575425	Okay.
1577501	1579062	But that's really it.
1579382	1582243	We've been going through the old system stuff.
1582283	1585484	Dan found my copy of Cotton for the PC Engine Duo.
1586204	1590526	So I have this feeling that tomorrow I'm going to be breaking out the TurboGrafx and playing a lot of Cotton.
1591486	1595627	It came out actually on the Neo Geo Pocket Color in the States, I think.
1596328	1601009	But it's a game where you play as a little witch riding her broom and she's addicted to this candy that makes her throw up.
1602690	1603170	Called Willow.
1604542	1606563	And it's funny in the game she goes, WELO!
1609025	1610465	So anyway, I'm done.
1611406	1611646	Yay.
1612166	1613387	Alright, Angel, how was your week?
1613427	1613847	How was your day?
1615508	1617189	Monday was... Monday.
1618070	1618370	Yeah.
1619130	1620391	I got chocolate and stuff.
1620471	1620972	Is that new?
1621192	1622092	Yes, that's new.
1622773	1624033	He's pointing at my necklace.
1624293	1626615	Angel's got a heart around her neck.
1626715	1628016	It's a little gold heart.
1628096	1629396	I wonder where that came from.
1629476	1629857	He he.
1630337	1631338	He he, he he.
1631418	1632558	Yeah, Magus' fault.
1632618	1633659	Alright, it's all good.
1634895	1647479	Um, jeez, I don't remember what really happened this week, aside from that, and then, you know, school and work and stuff, and Rob's looking at his caps and playing with them, eek!
1649459	1652460	Actually, yeah, he's got a couple songs to get now, yay!
1653540	1659322	And, uh, by the way, I drank way too much soda this week for that, so, like, you know?
1661106	1667489	Contrary to popular belief, as much as I like people to do things for me, you don't have to drink all that Pepsi to win me free songs.
1667549	1668069	Seriously.
1668469	1669369	Moderation, honey.
1669429	1670590	It's okay.
1670630	1673031	I'll just take what you have extra.
1673191	1673671	It's all good.
1674411	1675872	Who said it was all regular soda?
1677112	1677493	Still.
1677613	1677953	Still.
1678793	1679673	Water's good, too.
1679754	1681254	You can do the water once in a while.
1682114	1682555	Of course.
1683155	1683495	Anyway.
1685076	1686656	God, not much went on, really.
1686856	1688577	I mean, I played some games, but...
1689238	1689638	Not much.
1689858	1691259	Oh yeah, and then the internet went out.
1691639	1692019	Damn it.
1692359	1693100	Two days later.
1694580	1697602	Two days later and some phone calls.
1697822	1700743	We finally have internet back, so that's good.
1702264	1705285	And I don't know what else happened this week.
1706285	1707566	It just went by way too quick.
1710067	1711147	Alright, then I guess you're done.
1712008	1714829	Well, Loki looks like he's cooking, so I guess I'll talk about my week.
1715484	1717625	My Valentine's Day, now I'm the single bitch in here.
1718005	1720026	Everybody else is in a relationship, but I'm the single bitch.
1720247	1720727	That's fine.
1721347	1721927	I'm okay with that.
1724089	1732393	You did, but for Valentine's Day, actually one of my buddies had a little cookover thing.
1732573	1734794	Like he cooked dinner for a bunch of single people.
1734854	1737356	He had like a singles dinner, which I think is really nice.
1737396	1738276	That's a very good idea.
1738456	1740697	That was very nice and very sweet, so I was happy that he did that.
1740717	1743939	So he gave me something to do on Valentine's Day where I didn't feel lonely.
1745259	1752701	And I didn't even have to put out, and I didn't have to buy flowers for anybody, so it was great.
1752782	1754862	So I got steak on Valentine's Day.
1755662	1756343	How great is that?
1756703	1758163	I got homemade steak on Valentine's Day.
1758183	1760324	It's awesome.
1760724	1761764	Because beef is love.
1762365	1763125	Seriously, it is.
1765023	1767444	And no, you perverts, not that kind of meat.
1768945	1769365	Bastards.
1770606	1772927	Let's see, what else did I do this week?
1772967	1777930	I played a lot of WarioWare Touched, because I bought it on the DS on Tuesday, the day it came out.
1778350	1780731	Because, you know, I was all excited for a new WarioWare game.
1781377	1795362	and there was a side of me where I was kind of like what if they do the Nintendo thing and just recycle the same garbage and I have to play the same damn indie games but they're all new and that made me so happy so I'll gush about that more on this week's podcast so definitely check that out if you haven't yet.
1796082	1797342	WarioWare is awesome.
1797963	1798643	I'm very happy with it.
1798883	1801224	There are some downsides to it though so I'll talk about it later.
1803184	1805445	And then I was doing a little bit of retro gaming too as well.
1805625	1807186	I've been playing a little more with the emulator.
1807226	1809026	I don't know why I've been getting so back into that lately.
1809486	1810907	I think it's because I've been trying to
1812073	1812493	Final Fantasy XI
1833703	1835624	And I got killed so, so bad.
1835684	1841309	I came in last place, and like seventh place, which is next to last place, had like twice as many kills as I did.
1841589	1842469	That is how sad it was.
1843410	1844511	I was just not meant to play Halo.
1844951	1846693	Or any first person shooter for that matter, I don't think.
1848814	1850395	Otherwise, what did I end up doing in real life?
1850455	1854899	Last night I went out to the casino, and I lost $60.
1855359	1858041	But, you know, that's okay, because I'm going to win it all back next time.
1858061	1858962	I'm going to win it all back.
1861303	1862144	And I went to the buffet.
1862164	1862244	Okay.
1862574	1863655	Biggest buffets are awesome.
1864655	1874520	And you know, when I went out to lunch with an old friend of mine today, I went out to lunch with Julie today, and she was saying, you know, when people say that they're going to the casino to go to the buffet, that's just code words for gambling.
1875380	1876621	And I'm like, yeah, sadly it is.
1876961	1878042	I go before the buffet.
1878862	1881003	I only gambled a dollar.
1882064	1882744	But you gambled.
1883561	1884061	Thanks for watching!
1906706	1908687	The chat room is saying you suck at gambling.
1908727	1909668	I do suck at gambling.
1909688	1911008	I should stop.
1911068	1911849	I really need to stop.
1912429	1913510	But it's so addicting.
1916871	1917772	Loki, how was your week?
1917812	1918332	How was your day?
1921833	1924355	He's getting his food finished up before he can talk in the microphone here.
1925335	1926196	Is that still on cam?
1926816	1930077	www.orangeloungeradio.com Our amazing Orange Lounge kitchen.
1932018	1932859	Actually, we can't hear you, bud.
1932879	1933219	Turn on the mic.
1935137	1937879	Yes, it has a shot of the empty walk at the moment.
1937999	1938340	Okay.
1939160	1939881	Which will be full.
1941583	1943504	Well, had a cold this week.
1943824	1944425	That sucked.
1945726	1946967	Saw Constantine.
1946987	1947748	That was pretty good.
1949329	1950510	Played lots of Final Fantasy.
1950530	1951431	That was pretty cool.
1952352	1958697	And then to top it all off in the final nail in the coffin, my power supply goes out of my computer.
1959017	1959678	That sucked.
1961442	1984287	And, so yeah, so pretty much today was, I was being very lethargic, just like, slept for ten hours, got up, ate some waffles, watched Ghost in the Shell 2 Innocence, I actually watched one of my movies I got, surprisingly enough, and then slept for another three hours, or, I don't even know, slept for an hour or so.
1984307	1986888	And I don't know why.
1987406	1994811	And now because I just realized I haven't had any actual protein in my body for a while, and I kind of feel faint, so I had to cook food.
1995712	1996892	That was my week.
1997793	1998814	When was the last time you ate?
1999774	2001095	This morning, I had waffles.
2001155	2001836	Oh yeah, waffles.
2001976	2002576	But no protein.
2003357	2004318	No protein in waffles.
2004698	2006699	Unfortunately not, there's... Just waffle goodness.
2006959	2009021	Waffle and Aunt Jemima.
2011743	2013404	No protein in Aunt Jemima either.
2013684	2014524	Or her syrup, anyway.
2014885	2015065	No...
2015785	2017465	Her syrup has no protein in it.
2018386	2019726	It's not very tangy either.
2020166	2023927	Aunt Jemima might have protein in her though, but... Anyway.
2027047	2032709	Oh, and then we have another person who's knocking on the door, so... It's explicit!
2032729	2035289	You know that knocker's just for decorative purposes, actually.
2035749	2038710	Dude, I just found a neat link on somebody's digital... Alright, I'm done.
2038910	2039470	Tell us about it.
2039590	2040270	Alright, thanks, Loki.
2040330	2042551	The online entomology dictionary.
2043791	2044291	That's pretty cool.
2045242	2050324	and I guess just because I'm the only real nerd here that only I really would find that to be a cool thing.
2050484	2052044	Well, our listeners might be nerdy too.
2052084	2052524	You never know.
2052704	2053585	I'll link it in the chat room.
2053605	2054045	All right.
2055645	2058646	Explicit, since you just walked in, why not tell us about your week and your day?
2060427	2061987	This week has been good and bad.
2062007	2065888	I've been busy throughout the whole time doing nothing but homework.
2067028	2071970	Of course, I'm taking like 15 units of class and I have two jobs, so it's pretty hectic.
2073211	2077674	Hey, I heard you ran into Magus this week in the arcade.
2079615	2080155	Uh, what the hell?
2083157	2083777	At school.
2086499	2088580	ARC, you guys are playing Initial D or something?
2089500	2096564	Uh, I don't play Initial D. This Dead Air was brought to you by a DDR Angel story.
2097885	2099006	Hey, that's what I heard.
2099086	2099586	I mean, jeez.
2099606	2100967	We were talking about the future, but not...
2102043	2104844	Okay, whatever.
2104864	2105325	Let's see.
2106105	2108626	I did not get a chance to go to that tournament this Saturday.
2108646	2110087	Oh, yeah, that's right.
2110107	2112648	There was another DDR tournament I didn't go to.
2112968	2113828	I heard about it, though.
2114409	2116289	I heard about what happened at the tournament, though.
2116430	2117310	Ooh, what happened, Drama?
2118370	2119511	Well, there's some good and bad stuff.
2119611	2122872	Good was... It was a decent tournament and stuff, as far as I'm hearing.
2123733	2128635	They've actually broadcasted a commercial for March Madness.
2129675	2130856	They did a commercial for...
2131881	2140169	No, they did an intermission to talk about March Madness 2K3 with a combination of Freestyle Revolution Plus.
2140189	2140730	March Madness 2003?
2140890	2141130	2005, sorry.
2141150	2143672	I think, oh damn, I think we're a couple years late.
2147970	2150192	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2171209	2173990	The Manager, Paul, and MilpitasGolfland
2188968	2190028	Screwed the pads over.
2191089	2195671	I heard there's people who are getting 10 misses in a song or 12.
2195991	2198792	There was no full combo throughout the whole tournament.
2199613	2199953	Awesome.
2200113	2203254	That's how bad the freaking pads were.
2207456	2211198	Which also concerns me about March Madness 2K5.
2211858	2213439	If the same result would happen again.
2213699	2215740	Are they going to do DDR Idol and March Madness 2K5?
2216690	2217230	Not this time.
2217871	2220153	We're doing Freestyle Revolution Plus.
2220973	2221313	No.
2221734	2222074	Hey.
2222474	2222774	No.
2223575	2224176	As in Mike.
2224356	2224616	No.
2224936	2225537	You listening?
2226297	2227418	I want DDR Idol.
2227938	2228279	Now.
2228639	2228979	Do it.
2229259	2229559	Do it.
2229820	2230140	Do it.
2230420	2230600	Thank you.
2230620	2231841	I'm not the one organizing it.
2231901	2232301	I know.
2232442	2234603	That's why I was putting out that special message.
2234723	2237245	Or the upcoming Sacramento tournament in April.
2238806	2239807	We need another DDR Idol.
2240828	2241108	Yeah.
2241596	2249057	Oh, speaking of tournament in April, somebody is actually in the process of organizing a tournament at that month in Sacramento.
2250037	2250698	And it's not you?
2251118	2251378	Not me.
2251618	2251958	Oh, wow.
2252378	2252878	Who's doing it?
2254938	2256459	A friend of mine named DJ Arrow.
2257079	2258299	He's on the forums.
2259019	2262540	Yeah, he wanted to go through the process of tournament organizing and stuff.
2262800	2263220	Good luck!
2263760	2264280	Good luck, kid!
2264700	2268041	Have fun!
2268121	2270221	It's not an easy path, but I have faith in him.
2271769	2272670	It's really not easy.
2272790	2276031	If he puts the time and effort into it, it'll be a good tourney.
2276611	2277071	I don't doubt.
2279232	2281053	Remember when we did tourneys, Janie?
2281213	2281513	Janie?
2282213	2282813	I said Janie.
2283234	2283474	Yep.
2284094	2289696	And this is as long as people can accept criticism without taking it personally.
2290156	2290496	Sorry.
2290636	2292317	Well, I know, I know, I know.
2292557	2295278	That was an issue back then, but...
2296092	2297632	That was an issue a few weeks ago.
2298453	2298973	Yeah.
2300833	2303974	But there was a lot of heat and drama.
2303994	2305815	There was so much heat and drama at the time.
2306795	2308655	That I hope does not happen in July.
2310396	2311396	Yeah, I made mistakes.
2311616	2312837	I admit I made mistakes.
2312917	2315877	But I admit my mistakes and learned from it.
2316718	2317558	Hopefully it doesn't happen.
2318498	2321299	Good for you that you can admit that we've all made mistakes.
2322697	2327078	I mean, a lot of things went through tournament organizing itself.
2328158	2340720	There's always going to be a conflict, an unexpected conflict that you may not be able to do because it could be the pad issue, but sometimes the place may restrict you from doing certain things.
2342461	2350602	I say next time there's a clause written into the contract that says, or the gaming thing that says, if the pads break down during the tournament...
2351249	2355150	The tournament will instantly become a whack-a-mole competition, and we'll just all play whack-a-mole.
2355531	2356831	Because whack-a-mole is awesome.
2356891	2361172	Well, if there's really a big bad error on one side, you can try doing it on the other.
2363013	2365114	Unless if both sides are messed up.
2365454	2373377	That's what happened at our first SACTO tourney, is that one of the sides was screwing up, so we ended up having to do PA all on one side.
2373857	2374277	Which, you know...
2376094	2381019	It made things go a little longer, but at the same time, we were on schedule, I think.
2381439	2386003	I mean, this was years ago, but I think it ended up being on schedule anyway, so we weren't too bad.
2386324	2388686	But it was just kind of a bummer that that had to happen, you know?
2389287	2390548	I mean, it happens.
2391028	2391569	It happens.
2392329	2396153	But if both pads, like I said, if both pads don't function, then you can't really run a tournament.
2397595	2399957	Or I don't even know what's going to happen right there.
2400796	2404118	What does Milpitas have, like, 50 machines, DDR machines they can use?
2404138	2409461	Unfortunately, it's under Paul or MGL's management, manager itself.
2410742	2417906	I mean, this is what the reason why I'm hearing why they did not switch the pads to inter-groove pads, which is almost in good condition.
2418286	2419547	Unlike anyone plays inter-groove.
2420925	2422946	According to what I'm hearing... Kidding, kidding kids, I'm kidding.
2423886	2428027	According from the sources I'm hearing, Indigroup makes a lot more money than DDR in Milpitas.
2428267	2430967	Well, I'm not surprised, because there's no new DDR game.
2431507	2437209	And the fact that they did not use the Indigroup pads for that tournament makes me wonder what happened.
2440529	2447591	I mean, they're extreme in 4th Plus with the messed up pads, so... Right, anyways, let's move on.
2447671	2448111	Sorry if I...
2448843	2449663	No, that's alright.
2450524	2451464	Don't listen to the chatroom.
2451904	2452684	Don't listen to the chatroom.
2454725	2455205	Here you go, Jamie.
2455245	2455765	Here's some Advil.
2458406	2459527	Or you can watch Loki cook.
2460067	2461788	We can learn from tournament drama.
2463608	2464088	Let's see.
2464729	2465749	Is anybody going to E3?
2466549	2467069	I want to.
2467990	2474932	I know that Jamie and Matt are, but I have to do the business stuff for Orange Lounge still, which I need to get up off my ass and do this week.
2476373	2476933	But I want to go.
2477392	2477632	Why?
2477812	2478352	Why are you asking?
2478492	2484215	Nah, I'm just wondering, because I was thinking more like having a group of people going to E3 and stuff, if possible.
2485155	2486836	I'll be at E3, but I'm going with DDR Freak.
2487336	2491557	Yeah, I'll be at E3, but, I mean, I have no, it's too early to plan.
2492498	2493338	Hey, who never knows?
2493558	2494118	You never know.
2494458	2498500	I think, who knows if the tickets will cost more, like, later on, I'm not really sure.
2498960	2503762	Well, you can pay to get in if you've got a couple hundred bucks sitting around, but, you know, you're supposed to...
2505017	2507278	Get the hookup by having some game companies.
2507858	2511499	I know places like GameStop, EB, and various other gaming companies.
2511819	2515800	As long as you have access to gaming or any interest of gaming itself.
2516140	2518941	I had friends that went under EB Games and GameStop.
2519001	2519441	I've seen that.
2519821	2521421	I know people too.
2523302	2530744	You can even say that you have a website dedicated to games even though you don't have it.
2533648	2534989	Now, wait a minute, wait a minute.
2535530	2551281	It is kind of hard to get in on a website, trust me, I know from experience, because we have a problem proving Orange Lounge Radio is a legit gaming thing, even though, God, we promote the hell out of certain video games, and our podcast is more popular than what we're doing here right now.
2552222	2558226	So, you know, and it's listened to by quite a few people, but we're still just a hobby, I guess.
2560408	2560688	I don't know.
2560981	2565165	because I know of someone I knew who had a fake website and went into E3 somehow.
2566646	2574373	If you know what to do, I guess it's possible, but I'm not good with that stuff, like bargaining and dealing my way in.
2579037	2579297	All right.
2579998	2587564	Well, anyway, what we're going to do is we're going to go to a break, we're going to come back, and then we're going to talk about some more Bomani news, I guess, if we have any to talk about this week.
2587604	2588245	We'll find something.
2589318	2599003	and all your favorite Orange Lounge Radio segments when we come back after this little break featuring another mix of various songs from various CDR mixes.
2599183	2599683	We'll be back.
2599723	2601244	You're listening to Orange Lounge Radio.
2649348	2650470	Thank you for watching!
2754581	2755242	Thanks for watching!
2812065	2812934	Thanks for watching!
2945377	2946201	Thanks for watching!
3000032	3009395	And now, let's listen in to an Orange Lounge Radio staff meeting as they debate some of the new programming coming to Orange Lounge Radio.
3010118	3014219	Jamie, I have a suggestion about some of the music in our Bomani Music and More program.
3014239	3015200	Can we talk about that?
3015480	3017820	No subject will ever be taboo.
3018121	3021742	Well, I was thinking maybe we should move Pump Up the Volume from Tuesday Nights.
3022282	3024823	Except, of course, a subject that was just under discussion.
3025323	3030664	Okay, well, what would you think if maybe we cut back on some of the tack music we play on the station?
3031225	3032505	I collect your fucking head.
3034480	3035960	Just like this fucker here.
3038141	3040741	Oh my god, why did you do that to Loki?
3041041	3044402	The holic thing on episode 69 was just a joke!
3045342	3051784	Now if any of you sons of bitches got anything else to say, now's the fucking time!
3052984	3056785	Orange Lounge Radio, where everybody has a say.
3061726	3063366	Welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio.
3064109	3064532	Episode 132, In Progress
3067028	3071311	We decided during the break that we're going to play some match game tonight, so be ready for that a little later on.
3072131	3074312	We haven't done match game in a little while, so we're going to do that tonight.
3075433	3077574	You will have to be on the Skype line if you want to play.
3077694	3082817	Actually, we always take one person from the Skype line and one person from our chat room that doesn't have Skype.
3082857	3086459	So if you want to sign up to play, just be ready for that.
3086499	3091082	You want more information on getting in on the Skype line, www.orangeandre.com.
3091102	3092383	Click on Interact With Us.
3092423	3095725	Hey, while you're on our website, check out the podcast, which by the way,
3097051	3098292	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3120259	3130443	Alright, before we get into what's going on with the match game, I thought we could talk about what's going on in the Bomani world, and a little bit of maybe the general gaming world as well.
3130843	3134304	Loki, you heard something about what's going on with DDR.
3134344	3138546	Apparently, there is a new DDR game out in arcades.
3139006	3140386	But don't get excited just yet, kids.
3141127	3142087	Yeah, it's another bootleg.
3143327	3143508	Okay.
3143548	3144988	Well, give us some detail.
3146389	3146629	Okay.
3147149	3147389	Well...
3149178	3151219	Coming to a Namco arcade near you.
3175809	3187051	And it's basically a PlayStation 2 inside of cabinet with some special hardware and it's running, I kid you not, the DDR Extreme, the US version.
3187911	3189311	So you've got that running in there.
3190232	3191712	And, well, it sucks.
3191792	3193452	The pads aren't even normal pads.
3193552	3197693	They're just these shitty internet, like the ones you can get off of eBay.
3198613	3199813	So they break really quick.
3201233	3201834	It's just shit.
3202834	3204314	That's all that needs to be said.
3206545	3208747	So basically, is it the same?
3209007	3210808	It's just DDR Extreme on PS2?
3210928	3212249	It's running straight off of PS2.
3213010	3215672	How does that work with the quarters and all the different modes and stuff?
3215692	3216532	You can actually buy stuff.
3216612	3218794	They have them for Dreamcast and stuff like that.
3218814	3223257	You can actually get where it has a whole quarter system and it'll lock the game out.
3224978	3228321	I don't really know how that would work, though, as far as, you know...
3231188	3236013	I think it might have something to do with pushing the start button, and that's how it works.
3236253	3238015	I'm not really sure, to be honest.
3238795	3239696	But I've seen them out there.
3240077	3240777	They do exist.
3242860	3250227	But yeah, there's been pictures circling around the internet, and it's literally a PS2 inside of a cabinet.
3252568	3255509	DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
3277720	3278581	The US version.
3278661	3279843	Does it have the webcam?
3279863	3284328	With the iToy web, you know, iToy type interface.
3285949	3287451	Does it actually have an iToy hooked up?
3287571	3287671	Nope.
3287691	3287952	Nope.
3287972	3289493	Well, that's lame.
3289734	3297643	And the thing is, is I think people are trying, they're trying to push it off as like DDR9th mix or whatever, and it's pretty lame.
3299096	3300138	Okay, I found that post.
3300198	3303463	It's over here on AaronInJapan.com if you want to check this out.
3303543	3306829	Threads called Namco once again outdoes itself in stupidity.
3307270	3311717	Posted by Windu, Windo, I think it's supposed to be Windo, D-E-U, 32.
3313550	3315411	Hey kids, it's the new DDR Mix.
3315491	3316312	No, not Mega Mix.
3316392	3317653	No, not even Extreme Plus.
3317713	3323457	This time we're really lower the bar by putting the PS2 US Extreme in the 2A DDR cabinet.
3323497	3325738	Not only that, but we've also changed the pads.
3326038	3332102	They're now Cobalt Flux wannabes, included with sheet metal on metal contact, but with a springy, cushiony feel to them.
3332162	3332743	Now the layout.
3333283	3336847	When you insert a coin, a big ugly number appears at the bottom center of the screen.
3336887	3339050	The thing looks like it came straight out of Atari.
3339610	3343955	Now when you insert enough coins for a credit and press start, you go to the main menu of the game.
3344256	3347259	You can't select anything though, it just goes straight into game mode.
3347699	3352485	Here you have the option of selecting single, versus, or double, regardless of how many credits you put in.
3353237	3359102	If you go to Versus with one credit, you are stuck at the character selection screen until you put another credit to activate the other side.
3359582	3363705	Same goes for Double, only you can actually go into the Song Select screen and pick a song.
3364026	3366648	However, one of the sides will not be active at all.
3369762	3370723	On to the gameplay.
3370963	3375585	If you've ever played DDR Extreme USCS or DDR Festival, you know what to expect.
3375705	3377647	Anyway, you pick the song, but what's this?
3378027	3378887	No mod menu?
3379167	3379668	That's right.
3380028	3382769	No possible way to get into the modifier menu.
3383190	3385131	All you can really do is pick your difficulty.
3385591	3390093	I've noticed, though, messing around, that you can hit the left-right select buttons in place of the left-right arrows.
3390474	3393275	So if an LR jump freeze is coming up, no problem.
3393615	3396217	Step off the pad and hit both the buttons at the same time.
3397011	3402476	I've also noticed that if you're holding a freeze and hit the start button, the freeze drops, even though you're still on the arrow.
3403657	3414348	Also, if you're playing single player, a credit is in the machine, and someone decides to press the other side's start button during song select, then bam, instant verses, also known as the third mix effect.
3415057	3421278	And of course, if you're one song away from completing your set and suddenly decide to play non-stop or challenge, no problem!
3421778	3426179	Remember, in Extreme US Consumer, you can go into non-stop challenge even on your final song.
3426499	3430820	And hey, if you really want to piss people off, go for the 20-song custom-only course.
3431180	3435101	With a possible 22 songs per game, there's no way you can lose!
3435581	3439402	Well, actually, you've already lost if you've put your money into this piece of shit.
3439969	3443250	That post, again, coming from Window32 at AaronInJapan.com.
3443570	3446110	Thank you for letting me plagiarize your post without your permission.
3446150	3454232	So, as my theory went, it is pretty much, you know, you have to put in so many credits, and after a while, it will let you use the start button.
3454292	3456892	That's why you can't get into the mods, because the mods use the start button.
3457612	3461193	And, obviously, it's wired for the, you know, select screen stuff.
3461293	3464774	That's why the left and right work on that.
3465834	3467454	So, yeah, it's just a hack job.
3468641	3470582	Refresh my memory here for a little bit.
3470862	3472403	Isn't there some type of disclaimer?
3473924	3481487	When you boot up DDR Extreme US, it says something about, this game is licensed for personal and home use only.
3481747	3482328	Nope.
3482508	3484108	Any, oh, come on.
3484669	3486249	Every game has that type of warning.
3486289	3487350	It's the FBI warning.
3487370	3487790	I don't know.
3487810	3488511	It's on everything.
3489191	3495654	I just know it's licensed for use within the United States or whatever, or North America, however that works.
3497469	3501450	I'm sure I've already sent an email to Konami and I'm sure other people have too.
3502330	3502750	Wait a minute.
3503110	3505070	You sent an email to Konami to tell on them?
3505490	3506150	Did you tell?
3506271	3507231	Are you a tattletale?
3507511	3508551	I just wanted to see what they'd say.
3509211	3509871	Did they reply?
3510431	3510851	Yeah, they did.
3511171	3519693	They said that they were forwarding it to their... Because I did... It was to Konami of Hawaii and they were forwarding it to Konami of America or something.
3519713	3520313	I don't know.
3520333	3522053	Some other Konami division.
3522713	3525194	Because Konami's got like 50 different divisions and we can't tell.
3525214	3526114	They're all Konami to us.
3526594	3526774	Yeah.
3527857	3529138	Alright, interesting.
3530700	3534383	This is the same day that I also wrote the email to Pia.
3535785	3537446	Loki's been a big tattletale this week.
3537486	3539909	What is that website, Savetoby.com?
3541090	3543292	There's this website where they're threatening to kill a bunny.
3544008	3548771	And I was joking in Loki's live journal, I said, ha ha, you should send that to PETA, I bet they'd have a field day with it.
3548831	3549512	So he did!
3549952	3557357	He sent it to them, and they wrote back this huge old email that said, people like to play pranks on the internet, and that's just sick.
3557437	3558338	I thought it was funny.
3558858	3559659	I hate PETA.
3560339	3565222	I so hate them, but I just wanted to see that website get shut down, because he's making lots of money.
3566904	3568505	Like 15 grand off of it so far.
3569345	3570486	Explicit, your thoughts on this?
3576005	3581570	What the fuck?
3581830	3590718	First we have the 20% speed up DDR Extreme Plus, and now we have this type of crap that doesn't even work at all.
3594321	3599806	But, oh my gods, you can play Go West in the arcade and everything, and your reign.
3599826	3601928	But the sides don't work, so what's the point?
3604435	3607240	The pads are going to be broken within the next day.
3607861	3609725	Would there be an actual point of playing the game?
3614874	3617158	Oh, it looks like... Actually, I'm getting a private message from...
3618243	3625726	One of our buddies in chat, and he's actually sending me a link to a picture that shows you can actually get the modifiers in this crappy game.
3626106	3627346	Let me post this picture.
3627446	3630087	I hope they don't mind, but I'm going to post it in our chat room.
3630587	3631628	And so you can take a look at that.
3631668	3633849	You actually can access the modifiers in this somehow.
3633869	3635029	It looks like somebody figured it out.
3635689	3636630	Yeah, you know how they did it?
3637030	3639330	They said they stomped on a bunch of the buttons.
3641171	3642412	That's honestly what they did.
3642932	3644992	Up, up, down, down, left, right, left, right, maybe?
3645573	3646373	No, I don't know.
3646846	3648908	But they have some videos.
3649428	3655953	Maybe what they're trying to do is just inspire the... They're getting their inspiration from the old mixes of DDR.
3656073	3658835	Remember back when kids... They're trying to make a buck off Namco.
3658975	3665880	Honestly, I could take a shit in a box, put it in a DDR cabinet and sell it to Namco and they'd fucking buy it because they're retarded.
3669062	3669743	No left down...
3670248	3672250	Remember when left, down, right, down, left was little?
3672490	3672810	Little!
3673271	3679956	You know, honestly, um, I should, you know, just create some stupid mix right now of Step Mania and Cellotome.
3680417	3681117	I can make money.
3681918	3682558	They're gonna buy it.
3683379	3685661	I'll say, it's DDR9th mix.
3685801	3691265	And wouldn't that be ironic if Konami came after you because somebody tattled on you just like you tattled on these guys?
3691285	3694268	Well, obviously they haven't come after these people since they keep making them.
3696950	3697631	Yes, explicit.
3697851	3699012	Speaking of selling a Step Mania.
3699500	3709943	Speaking of that, does anybody remember about some guy in eBay selling an actual bootlegged CD of Step Mania and saying DDR Complete?
3711183	3712404	You can sell Step Mania.
3712844	3713204	You can.
3713264	3714484	It's in the license agreement.
3714504	3715885	You just can't include songs with it.
3717905	3720486	Yeah, and one of the songs says banner.png.
3722727	3726968	Our first, second, third, fourth, fifth, and et cetera, et cetera.
3727890	3729811	So what happened with this on eBay?
3730271	3731212	Did something happen?
3731432	3732392	Six people bought it.
3732892	3734173	Six people actually bought it.
3735413	3736314	For ten bucks.
3738175	3740496	The average Joe gamer doesn't know though.
3740516	3748139	The average parent that sees DDR on Good Morning America and wants to get it for their kids doesn't know crap about it.
3748359	3750300	These people are just preying off the week.
3751044	3755167	Okay, it does not include any of the MP3s.
3756007	3767194	Two, the way everything is organized in terms of folder-wise, you get Hides Off You in 6th, 7th, and 8th mix, so you have duplicates of the same song.
3767775	3773938	It's like those 64-in-1 Taiwanese bootlegs that you used to be able to get for the NES.
3774519	3776120	Exactly, just like those.
3776673	3780500	Where it would have Contra in it eight times, but maybe the player was a different color.
3780860	3783505	I bought that for my friend for Christmas.
3788396	3790137	Where the zapper gun looked like a normal gun.
3791838	3800521	And the controller was an old Nintendo 64 controller that had the analog stick glued in there.
3800801	3807403	And then the other controller was a Genesis controller that they wired up.
3809667	3816171	It's funny, because after Christmas or whatever, they never came back to their kiosk in the mall.
3816211	3816652	They're gone.
3817672	3820254	I'm surprised people don't put this show up on eBay.
3822636	3823456	We'll sue your ass.
3824857	3828860	No, we won't.
3828880	3831362	We should put copies of this show on eBay and see what happens.
3832162	3832763	I'm going to buy them.
3832783	3833483	Anyway.
3834444	3834724	Anyway.
3836630	3839632	Of course, we're probably violating all sorts of copyright laws by doing that, but hey.
3841593	3841913	Alright.
3842313	3844294	What's going on in the sim scene right now, Loki?
3844334	3845455	Anything going on in the sim scene?
3846536	3847716	Even though all the sites are down?
3849597	3851298	Um... No.
3854500	3856541	Really, I don't think there's anything going on.
3858062	3860664	I can't confirm that since my computer's broken, but...
3862919	3863319	MaxVagina
3891218	3892779	On that note, I think we're going to go to another break.
3892799	3895580	When we come back, boys and girls, we're going to get into tonight's match game.
3896401	3896781	Yay.
3898282	3905686	And after the match game, we're going to do the cage match and all those other segments you've come to know and love here on Orange Lounge Radio.
3905706	3907067	So we will be back after this.
3907667	3915871	In this break, hmm, how about we're going to do some Smile DK to start it off because we haven't played Smile DK in a while.
3916171	3917172	We'll be back after this.

4278940	4279741	Thank you for watching!
4298021	4306593	Hiho, Kermit the Frog here, informing you that today's broadcast of Orange Lounge Radio is brought to you by the letter V, the letter A, and the number 59.
4306633	4312180	Can you tell me how to get, how to get to Sesame Street?
4315831	4317032	I actually have a prize for our winner tonight.
4317052	4318093	Not with me, but I will send it to them.
4346442	4348564	I have a Resident Evil 4 music sampler.
4349244	4350004	Very cool!
4350144	4351365	An actual prize!
4352245	4356008	And I have an ESPN Sports one, too, if they want a whole pack of them.
4356228	4362411	So tonight, you don't get hung up on if you win, or you get your window closed, I suppose, if you're the chatroom contestant.
4362771	4364372	You win an actual prize!
4364512	4364832	Amazing!
4364892	4368034	Also, the winner, going to the winner, will be the company Ubisoft.
4375216	4376177	Wow, okay.
4378337	4378617	All right.
4379737	4380298	That's awesome.
4381058	4390440	I have to see if I... I don't have my match game theme music anymore, and I don't have Loki's computer to leech it from, so I suppose we'll have to fill in with our listless music tonight.
4390460	4394001	Or I could just cough in the microphone.
4394661	4396582	That would be a lovely way to do it.
4396622	4396922	All right.
4397793	4401035	How about we just play Genocide and that'll be the match game music?
4401055	4401255	Awesome.
4401275	4401896	How is Resident Evil 4?
4401936	4403016	I haven't really played it yet.
4427307	4428067	I haven't really played it yet.
4428127	4429908	I've seen it, and it looks very rad.
4429988	4430968	It's very good.
4430988	4437551	It's practically, if you're one of the casual games, it's probably one of the best, or by far the best Resident Evil out there.
4440692	4443733	Wow, more dogs jumping through windows than you can ever imagine.
4446955	4452757	I mean, it's like an actual 3D game, rather than just a side, like a camera view that was in 1, 2, and 3.
4452797	4455858	You actually get to see everything.
4459284	4460624	Nobody's calling in right now.
4462245	4463725	Yeah, what the mobasses?
4464265	4471926	Well, you know, we got that buffer, so it kind of makes things difficult, because we have a slight delay between the time I say, call now, and the time that they actually hear me say, call now.
4472666	4474247	So.
4476307	4476587	So.
4478007	4482908	Well, you know what else is interesting is that a lot of our regulars who call in on the skypline are not here tonight, which is kind of weird.
4483888	4485249	I don't know, what is going on tonight?
4485289	4486509	What makes tonight so special?
4488991	4489552	3 Day Weekend.
4491374	4492996	Oh, I don't have a 3 Day Weekend.
4493637	4494718	Why do these people get a 3 Day Weekend?
4494738	4496020	Some of us work for a bank.
4496541	4497962	Guess who doesn't have to work tomorrow?
4508610	4509791	That didn't really work.
4509851	4510351	Wow.
4511172	4514313	You'd think by giving away a prize we'd have more people calling in.
4514353	4515194	Fuck the Skype line.
4515214	4516935	Just have them do it through the chat room.
4516975	4520857	Well, we have people that are in chat going, Oh, I've played before so I can't play again.
4521157	4522198	Sure you can play again.
4523199	4523799	Who cares?
4525740	4527841	We actually have a prize to give away tonight.
4528142	4529482	That makes everybody eligible.
4531904	4532164	Anyway.
4532754	4544500	Alright, if nobody calls in the first week, because I know we've got a ton of people who are in chat, because we have quite a few people in chat tonight, but they just aren't on the Skype line, because, you know, you have to download Skype, and then you have to set it up, and da-da-da-da-da.
4558528	4559629	I'll just sit here and wait.
4560069	4561770	We'll just sit here for the next two hours.
4562555	4563496	And I'll just wait!
4564676	4565437	We can do that!
4566638	4568019	Tick-tock, tick-tock!
4571721	4572301	Wow.
4572802	4574363	How stupid do we look right now?
4574383	4581087	I see Paris Hilton's gonna be in a new horror movie coming up, and it's called The Wax House.
4581888	4582968	It looks decent.
4582988	4586150	Except Paris Hilton's in it, and she doesn't get naked, probably.
4586511	4590193	I have something to add to that, that you could probably make fun of.
4592287	4593987	I heard her sidekick got hacked.
4594728	4596548	Her T-Mobile sidekick got hacked.
4597588	4598328	How does that work?
4599208	4605490	We will be doing Paris Hilton chat until somebody calls in the Skype line, so I suggest somebody start downloading it.
4605670	4607110	Fucking call already.
4608330	4612771	She did all Skype in if I... No, wait, no, I can't because my computer's down.
4614431	4616472	Oh my god, you guys, did you see The Simple Life this week?
4616512	4617632	Oh my god, it was so funny.
4618137	4620959	You guys, Paris Hilton was so funny on The Civil Life this week.
4621380	4624282	You know that one part when she said, That's hot?
4624302	4625803	That was so hot.
4625843	4627004	Oh my god, I love The Civil Life.
4627024	4628745	And she was working at a morgue I hear.
4629005	4632208	And with her and the dead bodies, and that was so creepy.
4632748	4633669	Like, oh my god.
4634450	4636311	And then she totally needed to have a makeover.
4636411	4637852	She's like so my idol.
4638633	4640934	Like, I just want to be her one of these days.
4641215	4643997	I wish I could be so rich and have all those clothes and the shoes.
4644597	4645318	Oh my gods.
4654716	4656336	Oh, sorry, my mic was off for a minute there.
4656797	4669659	Oh my god, you guys, did you see that episode where they were at the airport and they had to be the airport people and they were like waving and it looked like they were dancing and they were just playing around and then they had to empty the poo out of the plane as punishment.
4669699	4670720	It was so funny.
4670740	4672960	And Paris Hilton was so funny.
4673880	4680322	And then the poo fell on them and then she's like, wow, I haven't done this since last year.
4683457	4685678	Usually they pay extra the shit on me.
4692903	4697225	Sorry, I was just about to spit seven up through my nose there.
4697245	4704149	Then that one time where she was working at a fast food joint, and she's like, wow, there's more cock in here than I've ever seen.
4705830	4708632	And it was funny because it's... Oh, we're getting a call, we're getting a call.
4710133	4711774	Hi, here on Orange Lounge Radio.
4713168	4714408	Yo, Sky, Siggy here.
4714608	4716569	Hi, Siggy.
4717409	4721970	You have saved everybody from Paris Hilton chat, and now we can finally play match game.
4726351	4727051	All right.
4729252	4730492	Oh, great.
4730712	4731192	Go figure.
4731452	4734213	Now the Skype line is lighting up with calls.
4734293	4737594	I've got like four people hammering in all at once now.
4739028	4741750	You ever hear that saying, you snooze, you lose?
4741850	4742731	Well, apply it.
4745333	4750297	You automatically win my eternal gratefulness.
4751078	4753660	You have my gratitude forever.
4754260	4755501	And the ferret loves you, too.
4757363	4758504	And I love the ferrets, too.
4758564	4758984	Thank you.
4763347	4764268	Okay, finally.
4764308	4766310	You want to know who you're playing against tonight, Siggy?
4768115	4771658	Now you're playing for Resident Evil 4 sampler CD.
4771758	4772478	Isn't that exciting?
4773399	4775060	Even though I don't play Silent Hill 4.
4775701	4777622	Well, it's Resident Evil 4, so that's alright.
4779724	4782886	There's no way in hell I'm ever getting rid of my Silent Hill 4 sampler.
4785008	4785688	Oh, whatever.
4786108	4787650	I think you just lost right there.
4788490	4790011	I am lost.
4790031	4790592	Alright.
4791833	4792113	Alright.
4795880	4796221	All right.
4796841	4800805	You're going to play against MPQ in our chat room tonight.
4801065	4801526	All right.
4801726	4802807	MPQ is going to bring it.
4802867	4804669	He was the guy who got our trivia question right.
4805089	4805330	Wait.
4805350	4805630	Hold on.
4805670	4805910	Hold on.
4805950	4806131	Hold on.
4807091	4807292	Okay.
4807332	4807732	I feel better.
4807792	4808072	All right.
4809434	4814339	Let's get into tonight's match game.
4814639	4815900	You know how the match game works, right?
4816421	4816621	Yeah.
4816881	4817142	All right.
4817262	4818483	We're going to ask you a question.
4819898	4820858	And it has a blank in it.
4821278	4828340	And then your job is to fill in the blank, and for every celebrity in the chatroom, or I'm sorry, every celebrity in the studio that you match, you get a point.
4828680	4832241	Now here's the thing, I'm going to be asking for an answer from MPQ as well.
4832621	4835261	And for every answer that he matches, he gets a point.
4835502	4838082	And he might walk away with that Resident Evil 4 sampler.
4838962	4844063	So, don't let him do that, or you'll never understand the difference between Resident Evil and Silent Hill.
4844684	4845004	Alright?
4847643	4849704	Okay, repeat after me, Siggy.
4850184	4851164	Resident Evil.
4851484	4852865	Resident Evil, yeah, I got it.
4852885	4853565	Capcom.
4854145	4855026	Yeah, I know.
4855286	4856126	Silent Hill.
4856746	4857327	Konami.
4857407	4858427	Konami, there you go.
4858807	4859147	Good.
4859187	4859547	I know.
4859567	4862128	Yo, yo, turn down the Nature's Oxide.
4862408	4864749	Maybe we should send him a box of milk bones, too.
4865229	4865610	Wait, what?
4865910	4867370	Maybe we should send him another prize.
4867670	4867950	Maybe.
4868070	4868431	We'll see.
4868691	4869311	We'll see if he's worth it.
4869331	4870511	We'll send you a rawhide bone.
4870751	4871472	Let's see how he does.
4871752	4872312	All right, here we go.
4872392	4873032	First question.
4873072	4873672	You guys ready?
4874753	4875233	All right, here it is.
4876781	4884665	Rob, hey that's me, was all excited to start a brand new blogger this week all about his video game addictions.
4885426	4894850	The staff and regulars of Orange Lounge Radio, though, were shocked when they visited the blog to find that the first entry wasn't about games at all, but about blank.
4894870	4896571	Okay, don't answer just yet, Siggy.
4896811	4899073	We'll let celebrities have a chance to answer.
4902094	4905556	Orange Lounge Radio staff was surprised to visit the blogger
4906263	4911327	to find that it wasn't about video games at all, but the first entry was all about blank.
4917131	4918112	Everybody's writing down.
4922235	4924076	Okay, MPQ's locked in an answer.
4933903	4934544	Jamie's dinged in.
4952202	4952722	Everybody ready?
4953483	4953883	We got it?
4954623	4954963	I got it.
4955404	4955724	All right.
4956604	4957365	How you doing, Explicit?
4957445	4957865	Got an answer?
4958725	4959005	All right.
4960646	4966689	Staff and regulars of Horne's Lounge, though, were shocked when they visited the blog to find that the first entry wasn't about games at all, but about blank.
4968530	4969291	Angel, you got one?
4969891	4970391	Still thinking.
4970711	4971412	Angel's still thinking.
4979136	4979416	All right.
4982428	4987791	This is the first thing that comes to your mind, Angel.
4989591	4993753	Rob was all excited to start a brand new blogger this week, all about his video game addictions.
4993833	5001697	The staff and regulars of Orange Launch Radio, though, were shocked when they visited the blog to find that the first entry wasn't about games at all, but about blank.
5005018	5005459	Alright.
5008260	5009720	Okay, looks like she's written something down.
5009760	5010701	Explicit, you good to go, too?
5014466	5015727	Boobies Boobies Not a match, sorry
5042799	5043299	Oh, I'm sorry.
5044059	5045700	I totally forgot the other person.
5046060	5049001	MPQ put all about ham.
5049881	5050561	All about ham.
5051742	5054523	So boobies is not a match with ham or random prawn.
5054723	5055163	Explicit.
5055923	5056603	Gay porn.
5057023	5061585	Gay porn, I do believe that would be a match with Siggy.
5061665	5064726	So one point for Siggy, zero for MPQ.
5065566	5070767	Loki, shocked to find it was all about Paris Hilton and her wonderful shoes.
5071028	5072148	Paris Hilton!
5073800	5074480	Not a match.
5075061	5075421	Sorry.
5076061	5076341	Angel.
5077642	5079462	You're going to give me a look from now.
5080623	5081643	I said Kylie.
5082484	5083824	All about Kylie.
5084684	5086545	Very good answer, but not a match.
5086605	5086925	Sorry.
5087045	5091527	My answer was it was all about how he needed a date.
5092868	5094068	This is the part where you feel pity.
5094088	5095308	Feel pity.
5095328	5095929	Thank you.
5095949	5096369	Okay.
5096409	5096689	All right.
5096709	5096969	Thank you.
5097029	5097549	All right.
5097809	5098250	That's enough.
5098750	5099030	All right.
5100070	5100370	All right.
5100430	5101891	So Siggy's up by a point.
5102796	5104097	Here we go, question number two.
5104157	5106319	It's MPQ's chance to catch up here.
5107599	5109080	Loki was very sad.
5109501	5110281	Oh, where's my music?
5111022	5111602	Where's my music?
5112843	5113123	Thank you.
5113764	5116266	Loki was very sad that his computer broke down.
5116746	5119908	It seemed like the power supply just didn't want to cooperate anymore.
5120609	5122530	He tried to fix it himself, but couldn't.
5123110	5128074	So he had his friend look at the PC, who explained moments after opening it that...
5128647	5133771	Well, Loki, maybe it wouldn't have broken down so fast if you hadn't downloaded so much blank.
5138235	5142539	Well, Loki, maybe it wouldn't have broke if you hadn't downloaded so much blank.
5152847	5153928	Very funny allusion.
5154148	5154749	Very funny.
5156210	5157491	I see our chat room there, huh?
5158393	5158613	Yeah.
5159733	5160113	Alright.
5164114	5165555	Hey, laughter is my life, you know.
5167475	5168195	Isn't this great?
5168936	5175337	When you call in the Skype line to the show, the chat room feels the need to make fun of you as well as the rest of us here in studio.
5176917	5177358	Beautiful.
5178758	5179058	Alright.
5181719	5183839	One more time, I'll read this for the folks still thinking.
5183919	5187320	Loki was very sad that his computer broke down.
5188183	5191584	It seemed like the power supply just didn't want to cooperate anymore.
5191664	5193365	He tried to fix it himself, but couldn't.
5194005	5202068	So he had his friend look at the PC, who explained moments after opening it that, Well, Loki, maybe it wouldn't have broken down so fast if you hadn't downloaded so much blank.
5204529	5204769	Alright.
5206990	5209191	I'm still waiting on the answer from MPQ as well.
5210592	5211172	Oh no, there it is.
5216314	5216634	Alright.
5216654	5216834	Alright.
5221291	5221871	How you guys doing?
5221891	5222311	Are we ready?
5223132	5223992	Looks like Angel's ready.
5224392	5225772	Alright, everybody else is ready.
5225953	5229254	And I think... Alright, we got MPQ's answer too.
5229574	5230194	Alright, here we go.
5232135	5233555	This time we'll go with MPQ first.
5233675	5239577	MPQ says, Well, Loki, maybe it wouldn't have broken down so fast if you hadn't downloaded so much... PORN!
5240357	5241078	Porn.
5241698	5242498	Going for the obvious one there.
5242518	5243078	Alright, Siggy.
5244058	5248520	It wouldn't have broken down so fast if you hadn't downloaded so much... That mania sim files!
5248985	5250806	Step Mania Sim Files.
5251247	5252107	Oh, good answer.
5252168	5252528	Good answer.
5252548	5252908	Let's see.
5253569	5256251	Jamie, wouldn't have broken so fast if you hadn't downloaded so much.
5257412	5259093	Actually, I have to make this grammatically correct.
5259353	5259934	So many.
5260974	5262556	Final Fantasy XI porn patches.
5263597	5265658	Final Fantasy XI porn patches.
5265958	5266259	I don't know.
5266279	5267299	Is that a point for MPQ?
5267700	5268180	Half a point.
5268300	5269281	Half a point for MPQ.
5269321	5271082	There's so many of those online.
5271523	5272684	Half a point for MPQ.
5272744	5273044	All right.
5273725	5275466	So it's half a point to one point.
5276024	5277145	Remixes of girls Remixes of girls
5306138	5306598	Good answer.
5306638	5307419	Good answer.
5307619	5307999	Not a match.
5308580	5314124	And I said, it wouldn't have broken so fast if you hadn't downloaded so many crappy remixes of Max 300.
5314504	5322551	Now, now, Max Vagina has its special place in everyone's heart.
5324752	5326754	Alright, MPQ has half a point.
5327595	5328736	Siggy has one point.
5328776	5330517	It all comes down to this question.
5331255	5334797	One point for MPQ could win it if Siggy doesn't get any.
5335117	5335857	So we will see.
5335917	5338679	And it's good he got half a point because this way we're not going to have a tie.
5339039	5340360	Unless we get a half a point on this next one.
5340640	5341120	But we'll see.
5342341	5344622	And we've had a question about me, a question about Loki.
5345022	5346363	So you know who this next one's about.
5348084	5348464	Shermie.
5349344	5354147	DarkSakura decided that she was going to head out to RVGL to play some DER.
5355027	5356808	Unfortunately, the pads were broken.
5357481	5364807	And even more unfortunately for the parents and children present, they were shocked to hear DarkSakura call the RVGL pads a blank.
5370412	5374936	They were shocked to hear DarkSakura call the Roseville Golf Land pads a blank.
5378118	5380680	You can play with the grammar on that one a little bit if you need to.
5380760	5381561	We'll make this a little harder.
5381581	5382422	You can play with the grammar.
5383142	5386305	So she called the RVGL pads blank, or she called them a blank.
5391787	5392067	Alright.
5394350	5402518	You know, if we go this year, we need to go see The Price is Right.
5403319	5404019	I know, I know.
5407583	5408944	He isn't going to be living much longer.
5408964	5410966	I mean, that hair can't turn much whiter.
5413609	5414490	He'll be transparent soon.
5420265	5423210	They were shocked to hear DarkSakura call the RVGL pads a blank.
5423230	5424853	Oops, I didn't copy that question for MPQ.
5424893	5425715	He might want to answer that.
5425735	5428099	There we go.
5429061	5429982	Now MPQ can answer.
5430824	5431124	Alright.
5457489	5458971	Nothing, I'm just laughing at one of the answers.
5459412	5459733	Alright.
5461295	5462296	Everybody ready in studio?
5462496	5462757	Yes?
5464019	5464960	Alright, here we go.
5467414	5468634	This is the last question.
5468655	5471797	This is going to determine who walks away with a Resident Evil 4 music sampler.
5472217	5475600	DarkSakura decided that she was going to head out to RVGL and play some DDR.
5475960	5483405	Unfortunately, the pads were broken, and even more unfortunately for the parents and children present, they were shocked to hear DarkSakura call the RVGL pads a... Siggy?
5484126	5485227	Piece of shit pad!
5485627	5487248	Piece of shit pad!
5487709	5489710	Not a piece of shit car, but a piece of shit pad.
5490511	5491952	MPQ's answer says...
5493802	5500386	was shocked to hear DarkSakura call the Roseville Golf Land pads a, and I quote, fucking fuck shit fucker.
5502447	5503087	So we will see.
5503147	5506529	Piece of shit pad and fucking fuck shit fucker.
5507390	5508550	DarkSakura, your answer, please.
5509010	5511292	Metallic equivalent of fetid regurgitated dog shit.
5512172	5512632	Wow.
5512652	5516374	Because they were all too stupid to know what fetid means.
5521137	5521577	Not a match.
5521757	5522798	Explicit, your answer.
5524528	5525569	A motherfucking bitch.
5526149	5527490	A motherfucking bitch!
5528250	5531252	It's kind of close, but I'm not going to count it as a match.
5531312	5531592	Sorry.
5531712	5532032	Loki.
5533233	5535514	Called them a... The loos.
5536315	5537095	The loos.
5537876	5538876	They are to loos.
5539497	5539877	Alright.
5540337	5540737	Angel.
5541158	5544960	Called the pads a... Let's just say she dropped the C-bomb.
5545660	5546941	She dropped the C-bomb.
5547721	5548302	But I don't.
5548502	5550363	Rhymes with punt or shunt.
5550883	5553645	I couldn't think of anything else to quote Bette Midler.
5555231	5560494	It starts with a C and ends with a T and it spells cunt.
5563695	5564596	Now that would have been a good answer.
5564796	5565776	That's a direct quote.
5566076	5566496	Alright.
5568297	5568677	Here it is.
5568758	5569978	It all comes down to this.
5571099	5574600	If MPQ matches me on this one, he's walking away with a CD.
5575221	5579363	If nobody matches me or Siggy matches it, Siggy's walking away with that CD.
5580163	5584065	They were shocked to hear DarkSakura call the Roseville Golf Land pads a...
5585339	5589400	Sorry your time than staying at home watching the Paris Hilton porn.
5589820	5592001	Making Siggy our winner!
5592761	5593982	By a half point.
5594422	5597863	So if you want the CD, send me an email.
5598963	5601764	Or actually, PM me your address and I will mail it to you.
5601864	5605425	Now, now, watching the Paris Hilton video is not that sorry of a time.
5606326	5607426	It is rather entertaining.
5608723	5612466	So Siggy, you're our winner and you're going to win that Resident Evil 4 sampler.
5612566	5613086	And you know what?
5613146	5617770	I'm actually kind of glad you won it because now you'll be able to tell the difference between Resident Evil and Silent Hill.
5622253	5623174	So thanks for playing.
5624315	5625836	Any victory speech you want to give?
5626596	5628798	Well, not much, but I got some latest.
5629719	5629979	Okay.
5630099	5630659	Oh, sure.
5631000	5632601	Oh, some actual news on this show?
5633081	5633321	Yep.
5633481	5634022	The hell?
5634342	5634582	All right.
5634622	5634963	What's up?
5635063	5635523	What's up, Siggy?
5635848	5638630	The last unlocked one was for the Scorpion Fire.
5638690	5639091	Oh, okay.
5666397	5670079	Well, that's the only one confirmed, number 13.
5670259	5671379	Any response to the chat room?
5671399	5672280	They're teasing you on your laugh.
5672340	5674821	Do you have anything you want to say in response to that?
5692540	5694422	Well, I don't care what these people say.
5694482	5697344	I just like to laugh the way I wanted to.
5697725	5698545	You preach on.
5698645	5700347	Don't give a crap what our chatroom says.
5700407	5701288	We sure don't, alright?
5702048	5702309	Yeah.
5702769	5703430	Oh, by the way.
5703530	5703770	Yes.
5704471	5708454	The song A and AA, they're actually pronounced as ace and double ace.
5709535	5710496	Ace and double ace.
5711036	5711176	Yeah.
5711317	5712398	Oh, like a deck of cards.
5712418	5713218	Ace and double ace.
5713278	5713579	I get it.
5714559	5715380	I like A and AA.
5715400	5715420	I...
5720556	5721036	Screw that.
5721056	5722657	I'm going to call a member.
5722697	5724358	EDR is the 13th step.
5724778	5728080	Or A and A. Ah.
5729681	5730041	All right.
5730161	5731242	Thanks for the call, Siggy.
5731342	5732542	Congratulations on your win.
5732882	5733142	Email.
5733162	5734263	You got Jamie's email, right?
5734783	5735444	Yeah.
5735724	5737445	Actually, I'll just send a private message.
5737865	5738105	Okay.
5738605	5739446	He'll send a private message.
5739486	5740306	Yeah, I'm in the chat room right now.
5740346	5740586	All right.
5740886	5741066	Yeah.
5741287	5741747	Sounds good.
5742287	5742587	All right.
5742987	5743828	Congratulations, man.
5744268	5744868	Thank you, Sky.
5744928	5745329	No problem.
5745369	5745709	Good job.
5746029	5746309	Bye.
5746569	5747630	I just wanted to be accurate.
5747670	5749511	According to Dennis, Larry Nyquil is the 13th step.
5751647	5759569	When I hear the word ace, I can't help but think of... Of, um... What was that?
5759689	5760449	Wild Zero?
5760469	5761369	Or whatever?
5762489	5762729	What?
5763049	5767210	Or, not Wild Zero, um... That stupid zombie movie.
5768751	5769091	Remember?
5769511	5771291	I have no idea what you're talking about right now.
5771311	5772051	That was Wild Zero.
5772071	5772931	Yeah, it was Wild Zero.
5773031	5775272	I got you the soundtrack, the record for that.
5776492	5777192	I do remember that.
5777372	5778132	I have that still.
5778152	5778793	Who was it?
5778853	5780013	Guitar... Guitar Wolf.
5780093	5780853	Guitar Wolf, that was it.
5781730	5781930	Ace!
5781950	5784692	Okay, I'm lost.
5784912	5785392	That's all right.
5786633	5790074	Every time I hear Ace, I start thinking of this line from Red Dwarf.
5791015	5793436	Your nickname was never Ace, maybe Ace Hole.
5794997	5795737	You're an Ace Hole.
5798299	5808484	I don't know if anybody in here watched a lot of Red Dwarf, but Rimmer always called himself Ace, and finally Lister told him off and said that his nickname was Ace Hole.
5809785	5810105	All right.
5811615	5818786	We're going to go to break, and in this break we're going to hear... I decide we'll play some number 13, and we'll play some Ace as well.
5819086	5820789	Or as I like to say it, Ah!
5821550	5821670	Ah!
5822672	5825977	So we'll play that, and then we're going to do the cage match when we come back.
5827199	5827639	Orange Lounge Radio
5927953	5928941	Thanks for watching!
5976926	5978267	Thanks for watching!
6010269	6011750	Thanks for watching!
6090468	6091493	Thanks for watching!
6154850	6155932	Thanks for watching!
6197168	6199550	From the steps by the Orange Lab, this DDR sucks!
6235259	6240661	We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio and Jamie's spreading the inside joke love here in the studio.
6241681	6244962	This is an old joke from Under Sedation Live.
6245402	6245742	I know.
6246862	6249623	You know, wasn't that reunion show supposed to happen like soon?
6249683	6250543	It's supposed to eventually.
6250883	6251183	Okay.
6251743	6254584	But this was back when Mint Skittles came out
6255778	6262265	and Travis was joking about them making mint scattles to make your butt be minty fresh.
6262546	6263907	And I made a label for it.
6263927	6266050	You actually made the label in PaintShop Pro.
6266090	6267471	I'm sorry, I forgot you're not a Photoshop girl.
6267632	6269093	I have to use Photoshop and I hate it.
6269334	6269594	Anyway,
6272071	6273152	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
6292802	6293082	EverQuest 2
6312182	6316224	Well, they're going to add a new command line feature into EverQuest 2.
6316844	6322866	You know how you can slash say, slash fight, you type in the little command slash whatever?
6323466	6325627	Well, they're putting a new one into EverQuest 2.
6326327	6327988	It's called slash pizza.
6329268	6341493	And if you type slash pizza, it'll actually open up a little web browser right on top of your EverQuest 2 screen and take you directly to PizzaHut.com where you can order a pizza and have it delivered immediately.
6341966	6346810	Right to your home so that you can play EverQuest all night long.
6346970	6348351	That's fucking sad.
6350193	6353695	This is exactly why I wanted to bring this up for Jamie's reaction.
6353715	6354676	What the fuck?
6356097	6357178	Slash pizza.
6357478	6361502	If they incorporated this into Final Fantasy XI, Jamie, do you see this as a feature you'd ever use?
6362442	6362723	No.
6363944	6364504	And why not?
6364924	6370249	Because if I'm hungry, I can go into the kitchen and cook some food.
6372003	6376807	If I wanted to go out to eat, my ass would log out and go out to eat.
6377448	6378369	Because guess what?
6378729	6380391	There's real people out in the world.
6380451	6382533	But you've had pizza delivered to you before, right?
6382573	6383373	Maybe once in a while?
6384254	6388938	Yeah, but not like because I was too lazy to log my ass off the damn game and go get it.
6389239	6394443	Right, you order pizza because, you know, you want... I was too lazy to go get away from my movie and go get it.
6394503	6396005	Exactly, exactly.
6398388	6414036	The sad thing is, I know people that will use, I would probably use this quite a bit if they put this in Final Fantasy XI, but at the same time, that would probably be the point where I'd have to say, oh my god, Rob, look at yourself.
6414536	6416777	Should I be happy if we had a Pizza Hut near us?
6419678	6421739	That's true, we don't even have a Pizza Hut in town.
6422020	6424621	The pizza place closest to my house is actually Roundtable.
6425539	6429241	Right, so even if they built this into Final Fantasy XI, we wouldn't be able to use it.
6429601	6432002	If we could only pay for those pizzas in Gil.
6435263	6437004	That's the next thing we're moving to.
6437044	6440285	What if you could pay for the pizza using the online game currency?
6440345	6441505	How sad would that be?
6441825	6442826	That would be really sad.
6442846	6448168	Or like, if you order the pizza, then your character gets a vitality up or something.
6450149	6453070	Maximum hit points have increased because you ordered Pizza Hut.
6453965	6455406	Is this where advertising is going?
6457047	6459288	Order Taco Bell and receive bio effect.
6466031	6469953	No, and if you, like, order from Del Taco, you get the dia one.
6472294	6473254	You mean diarrhea?
6473495	6475736	Is that what you... Okay.
6475776	6476236	Or anything...
6481224	6482686	Order any hot sauce to cast fire.
6484069	6485671	Actually, Faraga, sorry.
6486352	6490198	Your ass begins casting fire on little goblin.
6492141	6493423	Wow, that's amazing.
6497836	6499517	What other slash features do you think?
6499857	6501737	First, slash pizza, what's next?
6502078	6503198	Slash blowjob?
6504318	6508540	Get a hooker to come to your house and have sex with you because nobody else will because you play EverQuest all day?
6508580	6511281	No, you'd order an in-game prostitute.
6514302	6517323	So I would like to just kind of humor that question.
6517623	6521945	What other type of slash features would you like to see in EverQuest?
6522865	6524626	Yeah, this might make a good list list later on.
6524986	6525506	We'll have to see.
6526050	6534594	I would think a good one would be slash exercise, where when you type it in, the game shuts down and your computer shuts off and it won't let you turn it on for 50 minutes.
6535014	6536194	So you have to go out and exercise.
6539916	6544538	Yes, you can see my computer has gone into that feature right now.
6544558	6546479	Apparently you typed it in earlier, Loki.
6550701	6553162	No, you actually have this bodysuit that you wear.
6554500	6558882	And if you type in slash exercise, then these little things stimulate your muscles to contract.
6560643	6561564	They actually do have those.
6561604	6563645	Like those ab things that they put on your abs?
6563805	6564685	You want to know what that is?
6565686	6566566	And this is a story.
6568127	6570989	A long time ago when I worked at GNC, I hurt my butt.
6572490	6576092	I actually strained the muscle that sits on top of my sciatic nerve.
6578053	6580694	And I had to have that done to my butt.
6583072	6589918	And so they would make the muscles contract and expand to the point that it gets tired out as though you had exercised it.
6589938	6591319	And that's all that that ab thing is.
6593121	6594943	So it just makes you feel like you've exercised it?
6595423	6595803	Sort of.
6595843	6598085	It's just to wear out the muscles to the point it would relax.
6598265	6600187	Because for me it was hitting the nerve.
6600327	6601568	That sounds painful.
6601628	6603870	I could never put one of those things on.
6604031	6604931	It's light electricity.
6606273	6609756	But they also do that for patients who have...
6610492	6613294	to keep the muscles from atrophy.
6613454	6615856	Isn't that like how Spider-Man became Spider-Man?
6616657	6618638	No, he got bitten by a damn radioactive spider.
6618918	6622261	Well, radioactive spider, radioactive ab belt, same thing.
6622281	6623862	It's not radioactive, it's electricity.
6625603	6626364	Close enough.
6629726	6630086	All right.
6634330	6638052	I guess we'll get into the Orange Lounge Radio cage match since all those jokes are...
6640779	6641659	I agree with Elmo.
6641779	6643480	There needs to be a slash slash.
6645061	6648783	Yeah, except they said, for me, what are you implying?
6648823	6653846	That I can't write my own erotic stories offline?
6654206	6654586	Please.
6658669	6660830	Alright, let's get into tonight's cage match, boys and girls.
6662371	6665812	The way the cage match works, you have to be in our chat room if you want to participate.

6669246	6673550	Click on Chat and you can participate.
6673590	6682499	And the way the Orange Lounge Radio Cage Match works, we put three songs in for your listening pleasure or displeasure, whatever the case may be, and you vote for your favorite.
6682940	6692329	And the winning song goes into rotation all week long on Orange Lounge Radio's Bomani Music & More program, which plays 24 hours a day, 7 days a week on this station when we're not doing something live.
6693484	6701686	Alright, so last week in the Orange Launch Radio Cage Match, this song won for the second time in a row, so it's going for its third win this week, we shall see.
6702727	6705707	You only get to hear a clip of it though, because you've already heard it before.
6706068	6710309	So here it is, a clip of song number one that you can vote for tonight, Freeze Pop.
6710729	6712869	You know the band from Amplitude and all that stuff.
6713150	6714630	Freeze Pop was Stakeout.
6751135	6752156	Thank you for watching!
6774466	6775667	Thank you for watching!
6802931	6813257	The feeling is elating, biding my time Yeah, I know that you'll soon be mine Soon to mine Can't let you see me Can't let you see me
6838883	6842127	Alright, that's our returning champion, Freeze Pop with Stakeout.
6842207	6849476	It is up against two new songs this week, starting off with a song that Jamie picked, and it actually looks like one I've heard before, but not in this.
6850858	6853020	I don't remember the name of the song, I just picked it.
6853621	6855844	It's the filter in Crystal Method.
6857350	6859312	and I don't remember the name of the song.
6859332	6860593	It's called Can't You Trip Like I Do.
6860773	6860993	Yes.
6861353	6861573	Yes.
6862154	6865336	And it was actually a popular song several years ago, but we'll see.
6865556	6866557	Spawn soundtrack.
6866617	6867498	It was on the Spawn soundtrack.
6867538	6867938	That's right.
6867958	6868739	See, I didn't know that.
6868799	6869580	I just like the song.
6869680	6870120	That's all right.
6870360	6871141	Hey, there's nothing.
6871161	6874083	Hey, I put Gwen Stefani in and it ended up getting retired.
6874103	6875564	There's nothing wrong with putting a popular song in.
6875584	6879407	That's why they picked this song as a cadence like way earlier.
6879447	6881709	No, you picked Crystal Method before, but never this one.
6882329	6884090	Who the hell cares anyways?
6884150	6884850	We can't remember it.
6884910	6885270	It doesn't matter.
6885290	6885710	That's right.
6885730	6887110	If we don't remember, then it wasn't in.
6887210	6887730	Alright, here it is.
6888191	6889971	Song number two of tonight's Cage Match.
6890311	6891731	Filter and Crystal Method.
6891811	6893212	Can't you trip like I do?
6940811	6941715	Just like I do
6982421	6986327	Just like that Just like that Just like that
7086548	7087693	Thanks for watching!
7146975	7149497	We can't you trip like me We can't you trip like me
7172213	7173914	I like the drums in the actual song.
7173934	7177597	I mean, it's a pretty good song, but I don't know.
7177617	7179958	The voice is kind of, I don't know.
7179998	7180939	I'd say 8.5.
7181199	7180939	8.5.
7181660	7181960	Loki.
7183401	7184121	This song is old.
7184181	7187304	I used to play this song while playing Cusar.
7188184	7190045	So, it gets the 9.
7190266	7191426	The spontaneous record is good.
7191446	7193688	I like Satan on there.
7193728	7194729	That was my favorite one.
7194829	7195269	You would.
7195589	7195849	Angel.
7195869	7195849	9.
7198231	7198992	Junker Cover Pants.
7199092	7199372	I mean, 9. 9.
7202122	7202442	Okay.
7202883	7203804	And I give, I know, I know.
7204164	7210550	I give it, um, it's like one of those songs, like it starts off really, really cool, and then as it goes on, I'm kind of like, alright, time to end.
7211031	7211992	But I still like it.
7212192	7212633	It's groovy.
7212833	7213854	I give it like a 7.5.
7214835	7215155	Alright.
7216456	7217337	Loki, your turn.
7217678	7219539	Song number three tonight is by you.
7220000	7220560	What'd you pick?
7220881	7222282	Well, it's not by you, but you picked it.
7224689	7249820	Uh, well, um, this song, um, I don't really know how to describe this song, this song is just different, it's one of those things I found on Amazon when searching for free music, um, and it's just catchy, I, I don't know, a lot of people aren't gonna like it, but, you know, I like, I've been listening to my car, it's just catchy, and apparently it's, it was, it's a
7250382	7270276	I guess on the charts over in India, because that's, you know, it's an Indian artist, DJ Siddharth did the remix of it, and it's from a movie, I can't remember what the movie's called though, I think it's like Tamil or something like that, but I don't know.
7270876	7274879	But yeah, it's a very, it's an interesting song.
7275479	7278141	It's trancy, dancey, it's got a little bit of guitar in the background.
7278161	7279382	Can you pronounce this name?
7281245	7284286	I think it's pronounced like Keka Keka or something.
7284326	7285767	Well, that's the artist, Keka Keka.
7285807	7286807	Keka Keka is the artist.
7286867	7289348	It's the Tamil song is the name of the actual song.
7289948	7295430	It says in the title, it says, and I apologize profusely to everybody.
7295450	7297191	That's the movie it's from, actually.
7298672	7299772	It's the movie that it's from.
7299832	7300732	Yuri and Yuri.
7300992	7302193	Yuri and Yuri, it looks like.
7302293	7304274	Yuri and Yuri, that's the movie that it's from.
7304334	7304614	Okay.
7304834	7307715	Tamil is the language that I think it's spoken in, and...
7308317	7314986	It's the title song for that movie and it's remixed by this guy DJ Siddharth and the artist was Keka Keka.
7315146	7318471	Alright, DJ Siddharth remixing Keka Keka.
7319011	7319492	Here it is.
7319872	7320173	Enjoy.
7357370	7358051	Thanks for watching!
7395894	7396536	Thank you for watching!
7554863	7555223	S.T.A.R.S
7617717	7618559	Thanks for watching!
7688967	7701314	Alright, we are back, and that was Kika Kika, DJ Siddharth remixing that, a song we, I believe, and I apologize again for butchering, absolutely butchering the pronunciation of this, Yurian Yuri.
7702575	7703675	Let's see what you guys think.
7704656	7705576	Jamie, DarkSakura.
7705997	7707778	That was pretty good, 8.5.
7707818	7708758	8.5 from DarkSakura.
7709639	7710079	Exquisite.
7711052	7711812	That's pretty good.
7712353	7719756	For some reason, I didn't like the beginning too much, but once I started getting to the actual music, I liked it.
7719896	7719756	8.5.
7719916	7720636	8.5 from Miss Blissett.
7720996	7721536	Uh, Loki.
7721877	7723397	I love the backbeat to that song.
7723437	7728539	That was one of the things about DJ Siddharth, even his other stuff that he has, he has really good beats to all of it.
7729560	7736042	Why he chose, I mean, I understand why he chose to remix that song, because he's, you know, an Indian DJ, so, I mean, it makes sense.
7736543	7739184	But, um, it was, I don't know, I...
7741007	7748534	If I understood the vocals, I'm sure it'd make more sense, or if I heard the original song, it'd make more sense to me, but since I didn't, you know, I give it a 9, though.
7748634	7751617	It's decent, but it probably is annoying to a lot of people.
7752518	7752798	Angel!
7754400	7759725	I liked it a lot, just like another, well, Indian artist that I heard.
7759965	7763909	It kind of just reminded me of that, so, um, I'll be nice.
7764289	7764730	I'll give it a 9.
7767469	7769351	I actually surprisingly like that song quite a bit.
7769411	7771414	I just think it needed some of the fat trimmed from it.
7771474	7774819	Like the beginning was a little slow and there's some parts that could have been cut.
7774839	7777603	Because that song was just about over six minutes.
7778284	7782971	And I think it could have been cut down a little bit, a little more compact, about four minutes probably would have been good.
7783391	7784852	Otherwise, though, I do like the beat.
7784952	7786613	I like kind of what they remixed there.
7786633	7787353	That was pretty cool.
7788033	7793416	I understand, though, why it has the big beginning, because it's probably meant for mixing in to your normal... Yeah.
7793977	7797719	But as far as, you know, playing it by itself, it kind of hurts it for that.
7797779	7798999	So I give it an 8.5, though.
7799019	7799720	It was still a good song.
7800440	7800680	All right.
7801300	7804082	Which is surprising that I liked yet another Loki's Caveman song.
7804282	7805723	You know the one you put in a couple weeks ago?
7805743	7807464	I've been listening to it a ton in my car.
7807484	7808484	Which song was it?
7808524	7809945	The Echoing Green one.
7810962	7813624	And I actually downloaded, you know the funny thing about that?
7813724	7816045	Echo Image, because you said it sounded like them.
7816365	7818446	Echo Image actually remixed that song.
7818586	7819667	It's available on iTunes.
7819707	7821328	I actually used one of my free songs for it.
7821628	7823149	But here's the thing, it sucks.
7823729	7824669	It really sucks.
7825210	7826070	I was so sad.
7826090	7828391	I was like, good song, good band, this is going to be awesome.
7828731	7829072	Sucks.
7830632	7832393	Oh, anyway, back to the issue at hand here.
7832453	7835095	Let's recap the three songs you can vote for tonight.
7836515	7839337	Song number one, last week's winner, Freeze Pop, Stakeout.
7846498	7849880	And song number two you can vote for tonight, Filter and the Crystal Method.
7849941	7850901	Can't you trip like I do?
7850921	7855204	I do.
7855224	7856865	Just like I do.
7859967	7862088	I had to pick the quietest part of that song by random there.
7862108	7862349	Whoops.
7863069	7867412	Keka Keka, remixed by DJ Sidarth, is song number three, Urine Uri.
7868993	7869933	Urine Uri.
7874684	7876585	Is that ever going to come out?
7876645	7878146	I don't know.
7878166	7878767	I'm starting to worry.
7878827	7879507	It's still not out.
7879567	7881229	What in the hell is going on?
7904989	7909312	Somebody needs to get bitch slapped, and I don't think it's Konami, I think it's somebody at Microsoft.
7909632	7914575	I guess they're too busy concerning themselves with the Xboxes that caught on fire, or something, I don't know.
7914895	7916036	Because you heard about this, right?
7917137	7929405	The Microsoft had to recall the power cords for Xboxes that were made prior to October 2003, because I guess if you leave it on for a prolonged period of time, it will catch fire!
7932651	7940416	They say it's only a 1 in 10,000 chance, but those types of lawsuits are still a pretty big deal, so they've got to recall, and they'll send you a free power cord.
7940676	7948441	I got an email on it, although I believe my particular Xbox is immune because it's a Halo Xbox.
7948501	7949682	I got the Halo Limited Edition.
7949702	7950522	I don't think it affects these.
7951723	7954025	I still got an email on it because they suspect it.
7954045	7954325	I don't know.
7954345	7955385	I've got to check it out at least.
7956606	7957787	Any comments on this?
7957827	7959308	Anything you guys have heard extra on this?
7960592	7963417	Our first Xbox already died, so it's kinda moot for me.
7966872	7969893	I guess that's what I hear is that the Xboxes don't last too long usually.
7970653	7971574	Here's the email I got.
7971614	7978456	It says, Microsoft has chosen to replace the power cords on Xbox consoles manufactured before October 23, 2003.
7978716	7981917	Our records indicate that you may own one of these consoles.
7981957	7983298	Hey, that's me.
7983378	7985838	Check the manufacture date on the bottom of your console.
7985898	7989880	No action is necessary if your console is manufactured on or after October 23, 2003.
7991460	7992400	Now I'm all curious.
7993141	7993861	Loki's going to look.
7994975	7996495	Loki's going to go look at that manufacture date.
7998056	8002397	I thought I bought mine after that, but I guess that doesn't mean it was manufactured after that date, necessarily.
8003517	8004038	We'll see.
8009899	8011019	You know what's sad?
8011160	8013640	That must have actually happened for them to realize it.
8015161	8015681	What the hell?
8015781	8016561	April 16th?
8016901	8019682	Yep, my Xbox was made April 16th, 2004.
8020362	8021682	I am immune, motherfucker.
8022563	8023563	That's my birthday.
8024975	8025476	Is it really?
8025736	8026076	Yes.
8026136	8026516	Right on.
8027917	8029579	Yeah, that's the exact date of my birthday.
8029599	8030359	I was like, what the fuck?
8031040	8031600	Yeah, that's cool.
8032060	8032361	Oh, well.
8032881	8034502	Yeah, I haven't had my Xbox that long.
8035243	8037024	Because those Halo ones just came out, so.
8039486	8042808	I should get a new cord anyway, just because they're really expensive otherwise.
8043369	8045250	Oh, yeah, just get it for free since they're...
8047642	8050903	You know, fixing the problem, according to what they're saying.
8051844	8052624	When did this happen, though?
8052644	8053664	I didn't hear about this.
8054605	8055525	Um, it's just this week.
8056325	8058226	Xbox sent out all the emails to people this week.
8058906	8060387	So, check your Xboxes, kids.
8061327	8067609	If you have an Xbox that was manufactured before October 23rd, 2003, you better get a new power cord, or there might be a fire!
8067909	8068630	A bad fire!
8069570	8070530	Fry-cro-soft.
8071431	8072191	Fry-cro-soft.
8073051	8073331	Alright.
8074612	8074712	Um...
8075521	8075921	Mario Kart Arcade
8099730	8100270	Discuss.
8100290	8101511	Bitches, you all going down.
8101531	8103032	It's going to have Pac-Man and Ms.
8103052	8104833	Pac-Man in it, and it's put up by Namco.
8104873	8106854	Yep, because Namco and Nintendo teamed up for this.
8107254	8110476	Here's the thing I'm wondering, and it's the thing that I've been wondering a while.
8110897	8112077	It's on Triforce hardware.
8112117	8114239	Triforce, three companies.
8114979	8118581	Namco, Nintendo, and Sega.
8118701	8119642	Yes, Sega being the one.
8119662	8120322	Where are the Sega characters?
8120422	8122223	Yeah, that's a good question.
8123444	8126306	You know, Sega has better things they could be doing.
8126626	8128127	Like putting out another Knights game.
8128999	8130299	Sonic does not get a car.
8130319	8131480	How much do you want to bet?
8151701	8161103	This is going to be tied in with either another Mario Kart game that's going to be released for the GameCube or the new console.
8162903	8172145	Yeah, because it looks like... Because that was the way F-Zero worked, is that it kind of teamed up with one of the home versions there.
8172605	8174365	It should be a card game.
8175465	8176366	You can save your progress.
8178266	8178546	Anyway...
8179426	8180326	It looks very cool.
8181927	8182827	Actually, it does have the card.
8183227	8185428	And Mario Kart is supposed to have the card system with it.
8185928	8186308	Very good.
8186368	8187208	Just like F-Zero did.
8187928	8188508	You know what?
8188629	8190349	Huh?
8191249	8193890	It's very interesting that they're using so many card games now.
8194210	8199331	You know, back when the Neo Geos were first kind of big... God, I remember those.
8199351	8200552	They were supposed to have it.
8201192	8206853	And I remember watching this back on... What was the show?
8207034	8208474	It was GamePro...
8209191	8210132	Oh, God.
8210432	8213414	You know the GamePro show was filmed locally here in this area?
8214455	8215735	I lived in Alabama at the time.
8215835	8217476	Well, yeah, it was filmed at the Channel 3 studios.
8217497	8217997	Isn't that weird?
8218217	8224881	But I remember where you were supposed to have a memory card that worked from your Neo Geo home system to the arcade systems.
8226162	8226402	Hmm.
8227163	8228604	Between the MVS and the AVS.
8230005	8236729	I never... And I actually saw the machine... You know, you can look on the old Neo Geo machines and actually see the card readers on them.
8237122	8240864	Would it be maybe that that didn't catch on because nobody owned a Neo Geo because of the price?
8240924	8243966	Now, granted, I know you own a Neo Geo, but you are an exception to the rule.
8244386	8246007	That's because me and Dan are cool.
8246707	8248328	Yeah, I mean, you got, man.
8248348	8250229	It was like cheaper to buy the arcade system.
8250269	8253411	Seriously, you might as well have bought the arcade system for how much that thing cost.
8253431	8257253	I don't know, he'll have to correct me on this one, but I think he traded a Sega CD for it.
8257293	8263636	But that's the thing, is that really that's why it was so damn much, because in a way you were getting the arcade system on your TV.
8263656	8264416	Yeah, it was like the same system.
8264496	8265517	It was the same damn thing.
8267625	8268886	So, crazy.
8270287	8273509	Alright, we're going to go to a break, boys and girls, so we can tally up the cage match votes.
8273529	8275850	And when we come back, we're going to get into the FUs of the week.
8275910	8277812	Please don't send in your FUs of the week just yet, though.
8277832	8280093	I've got to get the cage match out of the way and then we'll accept those.
8280413	8281114	I'll let you know when.
8281670	8288578	So, whoa, excuse me, we will be back after this with more, excuse me, how unprofessional, but when was this show ever professional?
8288958	8289619	More Orange Entredo.
8289639	8296706	We're going to start off this break with something Jamie wanted to hear, and I think this is an appropriate song considering the Xbox news we just talked about.
8297147	8298028	So we'll be back after this.
8432193	8433154	Thanks for watching!
8505146	8505827	Thanks for watching!
8554484	8555047	Thanks for watching!
8610615	8611077	Thanks for watching!
8712208	8717890	Mr. Random Person on the Street, who, by the way, is not an actor, what do you think of the Orange Lounge mainlining music in more shows?
8718170	8725293	The music is like being transported to just this dancing spaceship place.
8725653	8727634	It's unearthly.
8727874	8731616	It's like being at a club, except you don't have to actually ask someone to dance.
8732456	8734357	We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio.
8736731	8738492	and we're going to get into the FUs of the week.
8738512	8741995	But first, boys and girls, I bet you are dying to know who won tonight's cage match.
8744537	8745938	Tweet, tweet, tweet, tweet.
8746478	8746938	Chirp!
8747078	8747959	Sorry, we're all dead.
8748039	8749180	Actually, actually.
8752022	8752302	Thanks.
8753343	8754524	Alright, well, here it is.
8754624	8762429	Tonight's cage match was so close that only one vote separated a tie between
8763134	8766698	You look so sweet and clueless You've been moving on my brain for too long
8786277	8788419	Song number two being one vote behind.
8788519	8796044	So, in the Orange Lounge rules, it states that the host whose song did not tie gets to break the tie.
8796145	8799267	So, Jamie, is it going to be Freeze Pop or Keka Keka?
8799507	8799967	Freeze Pop.
8800428	8802709	Freeze Pop is the winner once again!
8807318	8811619	Just because I want to irritate the people who don't like it.
8813539	8813939	Alright.
8814879	8817680	Freeze Pop wins for the third week in a row.
8817760	8818700	Guess what, boys and girls?
8818900	8826362	If it wins next week, it will be the third song in Orange Lounge history to get retired from the Orange Lounge Cage Match.
8826382	8833443	The other ones being Gwen Stefani, Whatcha Waitin' For, and Echo Image, Come Back are the two other songs that have been retired.
8835419	8837900	I can't believe that Gwen Stefani went those whole four weeks.
8837940	8839301	Have you heard her new single, though?
8839961	8840382	It's hot.
8840942	8841562	It's totally hot.
8841582	8842883	I'm going to put it in the cage match later.
8843303	8847045	If I was a rich girl... Anyway, sorry.
8848386	8848826	You know what?
8848846	8850107	That's from Fiddler on the Roof.
8851848	8852268	Okay?
8853369	8854509	It is, but it's awesome.
8854549	8856250	And in the video, they're all dressed up like pirates.
8857171	8862813	Why should they be dressed up as pirates for a song that's from... Because it's MTV.
8862974	8863554	It's from...
8864384	8867286	and a play about Russian Jews.
8869667	8870088	Okay?
8873249	8877572	That's... Has anybody ever seen... I was going to say, is that your girlfriend, Loki?
8877852	8878793	Fiddler on the Roof?
8879113	8881795	She would qualify the Russian Jew part, yes.
8885457	8887678	I'm going to start calling your girlfriend Fiddler on the Roof.
8890802	8894846	Gwen Stefani now has dropped in my esteem.
8895386	8896768	But she's cool.
8897508	8899490	But she's being an idiot.
8900151	8901712	And I don't appreciate idiots.
8904374	8904755	Alright.
8904815	8906036	We need to do the FUs now.
8907577	8908038	Okay.
8909639	8912942	And why is it that we do these FUs of the week every single week?
8913062	8914524	Because of Gwen Stefani.
8930494	8941156	Fuck musicians who think they can get away with taking something that was perfectly fine the way it was and completely misinterpreting it in such a horrible way.
8941796	8943957	Fuck you, Gwen Stefani, right in your ear.
8943977	8946077	Because your ass isn't good enough.
8947785	8950626	In fact, your ass is probably... Never mind, I won't say anything else about that.
8950706	8951786	You know what's ironic?
8952126	8954907	Is that she's dating a guy from a band named Bush.
8956448	8958449	And fuck you, Gavin, for dating her.
8961490	8962070	Oh, damn.
8962110	8963090	Somebody just got told.
8965691	8968972	That's exactly what your fiancé in the chatroom just said.
8969032	8970012	Somebody just got told.
8970613	8970953	All right.
8971453	8973053	That's awesome.
8973173	8974594	And FU goes to...
8976235	8980378	See, I drove past an accident yesterday that was caused by an old person driving a car.
8982359	8989244	They need to make people, once they hit a certain age, take a very strict driving test.
8990545	8993807	Another SU goes towards idiots who drive SUVs.
8995108	9002052	I can understand driving an SUV if you have a legitimate need for it, but... Like you go camping every week.
9002533	9003413	Yeah, you go camping.
9003914	9004454	You know what?
9005014	9005515	Back in the 80s,
9006638	9007699	Bad Rob Bad Rob Bad Rob Bad Rob
9037782	9052455	I cannot wait until this is made illegal because it is proven that people in general do not pay as much attention to the road as you would if you were not talking on your cell phone.
9054456	9058100	You know, first of all, do you drive with your laptop on?
9058380	9059901	Okay, never mind, there are people who do that.
9059941	9060682	If I could.
9060702	9064165	Because people are fucking retards, too.
9065413	9069396	If we're going to ban cell phone usage, can we ban people who put on makeup while driving then too?
9070136	9070657	You know what?
9071157	9075380	I almost got hit with someone driving with a laptop on their lap.
9077282	9080764	Another thing is just people who think that they need to be one car ahead.
9081625	9082125	Oh, that I hate.
9082165	9088770	Oh my god, you're a car... And I can understand if the person is actually going 20 miles into the speed limit in front of you, because then they are a safety hazard.
9089731	9089951	But...
9090436	9096678	If I'm going, normally I tend to speed a little bit, I drive about 5 to 10 miles over the speed limit sometimes.
9097938	9104520	But when someone passes me, no, that's just inexcusable.
9105120	9113463	Nothing is, you don't need to be somewhere in so much of a hurry that you should endanger your lives and the lives of everybody else on the road.
9113523	9117804	I don't really care about the person driving, because you know what, if they die, that's Darwinism at work.
9120103	9124885	You know, but when they hurt other people in the process because of their stupidity, that's where I draw the line.
9125286	9129648	Now, if they decide to run off the overpass into the river and they're the only ones hurt, fine.
9130368	9130668	You know?
9133010	9141514	Another thing is, I am bad at this, I am getting better, but I don't ride right up on people's asses.
9142254	9149558	You know, I do have an issue with my following distance, but I don't drive all the way up on somebody's bumper where it's, you know...
9150402	9151463	The person in front of me stopped.
9151603	9152604	I wouldn't have any time.
9153885	9159450	There was this person who was right on my ass driving home from work the other day.
9160671	9166195	And I'm just glad that I had good brakes because I actually did have to stop very quickly to avoid hitting an animal.
9167776	9171920	And the person came very close to running into my rear end.
9172801	9175503	So I kind of wish that they had so I could, you know,
9176041	9179723	Make him go through all the hassle of getting worse and, you know, having their insurance rate go up.
9179803	9182704	But, you know, I had better things to do with my time.
9185165	9186185	But that's really it.
9186745	9187726	It's mostly about drivers.
9189727	9192268	Alright, let's go on to Loki.
9192288	9192748	I have one more.
9193148	9194408	Okay, let's not go on to Loki.
9194809	9199370	People who think that diet pills are the ways to lose weight, you know how to lose weight?
9199530	9200691	Get off your ass and work it off.
9203271	9203571	That's it.
9203731	9204072	Okay.
9204552	9204872	You sure?
9205813	9206293	Alright.
9206733	9207014	Alright.
9207054	9207394	Loki!
9208855	9209555	You're dust!
9209695	9210796	Fuck you, dust!
9211637	9213498	Fuck you, too, my cold.
9214138	9215039	It sucked.
9215879	9216860	Still stuffed up.
9217601	9219022	Been all tired.
9219722	9220402	No tired.
9220563	9221443	Tired bad.
9222264	9226326	And, uh, fuck you to my computer for being broken, cause I'm gonna have withdrawals.
9226707	9231530	Especially now that I think I've realized that Brad hasn't returned Rantheft Auto's San Andreas yet.
9232219	9233740	So I don't know what I'm going to do now.
9234780	9237681	Does that mean I have to finish playing Wind Waker?
9238061	9239022	I guess so.
9240562	9244624	And then, finally, the most important one of them all.
9245324	9246565	Fuck you, Golfland.
9246705	9248626	Fuck you and your ugly asses.
9249286	9250026	Fuck you, Keith.
9250186	9253427	Fuck you, management of Golfland and Roseville Golfland.
9253527	9257189	Thank you, because, you know, I love to be taxed on my own fucking money.
9258348	9264432	Let's flashback here to the summer when I got to build a brand new Step Mania cabinet for Golf Land.
9264472	9270917	I did this as purely as a favor because their sales had sucked, no one was coming to the arcade, the scene had basically died.
9271438	9273079	So, what was my deal with them?
9273519	9276401	I would charge them for parts, they would reimburse me the end.
9276741	9280344	Okay, they would have a wonderful cabinet, I would do all the labor for free, that's it.
9281725	9287049	So, a thousand dollars later, you know, I have this cabinet that's built here, they go to pay me...
9288039	9289501	And they're dragging their feet.
9289581	9294605	They don't want to, you know, they're just like, oh, Keith's never there, oh, the check's on its way, da-da-da-da-da.
9295145	9305133	So it's been dragging and dragging, and finally I get paid, and then they have the audacity to send me a 1099 for it.
9305334	9308676	A 1099 for my own money that they were supposed to be reimbursing me for.
9308756	9309997	Why am I getting taxed on my own money?
9310478	9310978	Fuck them.
9312059	9312580	Fuck them.
9313821	9316603	Um, a 1099 is the one that you pay taxes on.
9317391	9321153	No, 1099s are the ones they get taxed on.
9321233	9322594	It's misleading as income.
9323815	9327197	And... Actually, I think you're meaning a W-2.
9327837	9328218	No, it's a 1099.
9328378	9329538	Nobody's writing this a 1099.
9329578	9330059	Oh, never mind.
9330079	9331559	You're right, you're right, you're right, you're right.
9331599	9332860	W-2s are for wages, I guess.
9332880	9333981	Because they also put out 1099s.
9334001	9334641	1099, 1098, and 5498s.
9334661	9335041	And W-2Gs.
9335061	9336883	They put out 1099s for return funds for us.
9336903	9337403	I work in mortgage.
9347508	9348991	1099 for foreclosures and bankruptcies
9358757	9359577	So, taxes.
9359797	9361598	You know how much that's going to cost me, Golfland?
9361618	9365278	That's going to cost me $150 out of my pocket for your stupid shit.
9367719	9368679	Take them to Smokland's court.
9369319	9370599	It's really not worth it, you know?
9370839	9371560	It's really not.
9371620	9373280	A machine, by the way, which no longer operates.
9373300	9377341	Yeah, the machine's been stolen, it's been converted back, or, you know, whatever.
9377501	9379181	Take the check to Golfland and make them pay it.
9380041	9381702	It's not worth it, honestly.
9382282	9385362	Because it was hard enough to get them to pay for it.
9385582	9387003	It's not worth my time.
9387363	9387863	You know what?
9389358	9391419	I always say it's worth time to prove somebody wrong.
9407935	9410377	I didn't think to make copies because I didn't think it was going to be a problem.
9410797	9429910	So anyway, so then, um, so they figured out a way what they were going to do is they were going to make this fake invoice, okay, and make it look like I'm some computer company, and then they were going to give invoices to that so I wouldn't get, you know, charged a 1099 for it, and that was the deal, that was, you know, they made it clear that I wasn't going to get a 1099 for it, and that everything was all good, and I was done.
9430310	9432051	Well, guess what, they gave me a 1099 anyway.
9432071	9435213	So you should go into the machine and take back $150 in parts out of the machine.
9437209	9439350	I can't really do that.
9439770	9441691	Well, that'd be theft.
9442991	9443571	I'd pursue it.
9445392	9447152	So, yeah, they fucked me over again.
9447792	9450693	Just go in there with a chocolate gun and wave it around.
9453634	9454875	I sent an email to Keith.
9455255	9455975	It wasn't very nice.
9456884	9457964	And, you know, he hasn't responded.
9458324	9458785	Surprise.
9459345	9460265	Never ever responds.
9460365	9461005	So, you know what?
9461045	9461365	Fuck him.
9462165	9465226	And I'm officially, you know, I'm boycotting Golfland.
9465246	9466566	I'm not going back there ever again.
9467167	9469407	And I would urge everyone else to do the same.
9469427	9470988	Because they're just going to fuck everyone over.
9471008	9473048	So, just enjoy it.
9474428	9476389	I lost, actually, on that cabinet over $230.
9477529	9478630	So, thank you, Golfland.
9478850	9482170	You know, this is what I get for doing you guys a favor.
9482370	9482951	Thanks a lot.
9484211	9484471	I'm done.
9485877	9487397	All righty, moving on.
9493559	9494699	How can I follow that one up?
9494760	9500841	F you to myself because I have a whole stack of tests to correct and I haven't started yet and I have to have them done by tomorrow morning.
9502022	9504922	But hey, I got better things to do like play Final Fantasy and WarioWare.
9506863	9509003	And an F you to WarioWare for being too short.
9509243	9510764	I'm already like all the way through it.
9512392	9513934	I really don't have a lot interesting to say.
9513954	9515196	You need to put the parrots.
9528533	9529553	The parrot was cool.
9530053	9534575	And the last unlock I got was a soundtrack thing.
9534915	9540097	So now I can get Ashley's theme song uninterrupted.
9540177	9541757	And the theme song for Ashley is cool.
9542097	9544598	So I'm going to rip the theme song because it's rad.
9546599	9548479	Let's go to our guest FUs.
9548659	9551060	I guess we'll start it off with Explicit.
9553567	9562029	Well, now that I found out that everybody was talking about the FUs already, Jamie was talking about the SCPs, I was supposed to say the same thing, so my FU goes to that section.
9564130	9568151	And FU to RVGL, I think Loki explained some of that already.
9569552	9570412	Let's see.
9570432	9576434	Oh yeah, big FU goes to fucking parents who blame it on the media.
9576854	9577394	Sorry, sorry.
9579870	9593778	Okay, an F you goes to parents accusing the media for actions that kids commit all for their own, what they think is a bad influence to kids.
9594699	9606586	First of all, if you're going to let your kids play stuff like Halo 2 or Grand Theft Auto San Andreas, you should know what the consequences are and tell your kids how...
9609228	9611530	Don't blame it on the kids, blame it on their parents.
9621682	9622763	I was about to get there too.
9624484	9626404	Parents are the most responsible ones for the issues.
9627865	9629066	My aunt just had a lawsuit with some games.
9629086	9632107	For some reason, I told her that it's not really worth the lawsuit.
9632367	9635368	They treat their kids the wrong way.
9647714	9649555	That's all I'm about to say.
9651957	9657561	FPU goes to, of course, I've already discussed this before, the Milpius Golf Line issue with pads.
9658682	9667888	They should have switched it to within the groove pads, and hopefully they make sure that the pads are going to be well for March Madness 2K5.
9669789	9672892	But to make sure everything calms down, I'll say to be continued for now.
9674253	9676274	Alright then, Angel's turn to get ranty.
9677879	9698919	uh, FU to no internet for two days, that sucked, um, yeah, um, and uh, FU to Final Fantasy XI not working, cause that sucks, it black screens right after the play online stuff's over, and I think it might have to do with the last update we just had, so, I don't know what's up with that, so, dammit I wanna play!
9700621	9702963	Call Squeenix and call him a bunch of fucking fuckers.
9704599	9706841	Um, maybe.
9709244	9719135	And, uh, if you had a, like, a, you know, the holiday weekend, because it went too fast again, so, you know, tomorrow's the last day of that.
9719996	9721598	Be glad you get a holiday weekend.
9721638	9722559	Sit down, sit down.
9723476	9724077	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
9754564	9755885	One F you for tonight.
9756705	9759787	F you to the chatroom for teasing me about the way I laugh.
9759887	9762169	I don't give a flying fuck what you guys say about my laugh.
9762649	9766411	I laugh the way I wanted to, so in the words of Yoda, up the shut fuck.
9768132	9768953	Preach on, brother.
9770322	9774025	RPG King 7 says, first, thanks for reading my FU last week.
9774185	9774545	You're welcome.
9774566	9776487	I actually think it would be up the shut fuck.
9778389	9778769	Shut up.
9779429	9782252	RPG King 7 says, thanks for reading my FU last week.
9782332	9782772	You're welcome.
9783092	9785975	This week, FU to kill stealers in MapleStory.
9787896	9788096	Ouch.
9789417	9791259	Elmullet would like to give a playful FU.
9793420	9798464	F you to Siggy for telling me to call into Orange Lounge Radio now, only to take the spot himself.
9799084	9802687	Now I feel the need to pwn him at Guilty Gear X to reload again.
9803871	9804271	Call Squeenix?
9829864	9834048	F you to EB for not giving me cash back for the game not working so I had to buy something else.
9834469	9837612	And F you to iTunes for not having real good music available.
9837952	9847261	Hey, do a search for an iMix called Dance Dance Revolution and it says Orange Lounge Radio's name in the description and it's all a whole bunch of Dance Dance Revolution songs.
9847862	9849163	I put it together and it's on iTunes.
9849303	9849763	Look for it.
9850004	9850624	I'll find a link.
9850724	9851305	Maybe I can find a link.
9852446	9855668	Miklatov says, first FU of the week goes to gaming expenses.
9856189	9858930	E3 plus PSP plus Night Style equals poorness.
9859491	9861332	Second FU goes to my Nintendo DS.
9861432	9864494	I have two games and they are the only two games I want for the next several months.
9864894	9867716	Therefore, I may trade it in towards my PSP purchase.
9868176	9871659	Final FU goes to my car smelling like burning every time I drive it.
9873480	9876962	Bugged says, FU to no naked hot tubbing this week.
9877122	9877883	I'm a demubass.
9879500	9899558	Sephiroth 1215 or 1215 or 1215 says F you to all the snow that is falling right now and an F you for the difficulty being raised all the way up on the DDR machine Illusion says F you to Shakey's not having the regular I got you babe to do karaoke to they had some lame remix with bad synth in it
9900114	9910485	Anyway, it was totally lame and not gay enough for the incredibly homoerotic I Got You Babe karaoke that I was doing with Larry, a big burly construction worker from the bay that whispers sweet nothings into my ear at night.
9912487	9912787	Huh?
9914809	9915170	Huh?
9916791	9919174	Just a wake up call if you guys are falling asleep there.
9920359	9924900	Anyway, F you to this week for going by so slow but that it was only four days long.
9925400	9930421	Illusion says, F you to Gwen Stefani for selling out and her crappy new song that makes me cry.
9932461	9935262	John Fields says, huge F you to NCSX.
9935462	9942483	I waited 12 days and you still haven't gotten PlayStation, or PlayStation, Phantasy Star Online Episode 4 in.
9942863	9943963	I had to go with Hamea.
9944283	9944664	F you.
9945144	9947064	Also F you to not having enough hours in a week.
9949574	9954097	DJ Ranma S says, F you to a friend of mine for being a dick to this girl I know.
9954177	9957619	Payback's a bitch, cause I'm gonna go for it while you waller in your own self-pity.
9959140	9960001	Let's have tea!
9960301	9961022	I love that name.
9961822	9962503	Let's have tea.
9962803	9963203	I like tea.
9963263	9965485	I need tea right now, cause my voice has been hoarse.
9965565	9966846	That's a very pleasant name.
9967486	9968947	Which so doesn't work for this segment.
9969227	9971729	So I'm renaming this person, Let's Have Evil Tea.
9973210	9973930	You know what would be funny?
9974010	9974251	What?
9976052	9977873	Um, well, it's kind of random.
9978253	9979274	Okay, um,
9979778	9983240	But you know how we were talking about earlier how they have those slash whatevers?
9983640	9983880	Yeah.
9983960	9987422	Okay, well, if you're, like, constipated, you can have slash logout.
9994066	9994826	That was nasty.
9995506	9995967	I hate you.
9996747	10001750	Let's Have Tea says, F you to the guy who hit my stepdad's SUV earlier today.
10001850	10003010	It got flipped and totaled.
10003891	10005672	That's what you get for having an SUV.
10005712	10007352	Hey, hey, hey, that's not nice.
10007392	10008213	He has a...
10009221	10010341	or it might be a she, sorry.
10010562	10011482	They have a pleasant name.
10012582	10022666	I think it was Julie who drove by a wreck where an SUV and like a minivan ran into each other and the SUV rolled and landed on the minivan.
10022926	10025967	No matter what kind of car you drive, people should... I think about two birds with one stone.
10026007	10026567	I mean, what?
10026808	10028928	I mean, SUVs are so big in the first place.
10028988	10030969	It has to take a lot of talent to crash into one.
10031049	10032190	So, I mean, come on.
10033110	10035031	Tell your dad to like get a real car now.
10036471	10036871	Stepdad.
10037151	10038492	One that's got a...
10039102	10061657	Lower Center of Gravity Legend of Zaku says F you to elements of my school's student body aka the elitists for dropping emo bombs last week over the N word being used in a play in my school that illustrates the horrors of slavery America has a way of driving the point across that slavery was really fucked up back then which is, in my humble opinion, the best way to do it.
10062197	10066200	Okay, I know I'm old, okay, but what the hell is an emo bomb?
10067290	10068711	Well, you know what emo is?
10068911	10071473	Emo is that, you know, I'm so sad.
10071893	10075336	I'm going to slash my wrist because I'm so sad.
10076456	10078818	It's basically modern goth.
10079138	10079759	Yeah, kind of.
10079799	10081100	Modern goth in happy colors.
10081360	10081700	Okay.
10083341	10087224	So basically it's like the people who bag on movies without seeing them.
10087264	10092627	Like they bag on dogma for being a satanic movie without realizing that it's actually a pretty religious movie at heart.
10092888	10094769	I think that's kind of the point Zach was trying to make here.
10095999	10098962	F you to FreezePop, infecting the ears of Orange Lounge Radio listeners.
10100303	10106209	And F you to tonight's internet connection at my campus, causing major skipping in... And then he got cut off.
10107390	10113315	Dark Knight says, one F you to Squeenix for making the cutscenes in Star Ocean too darn long.
10114176	10115257	I have to add another one.
10116438	10116698	Okay.
10117099	10119601	F you to the burning sensation of Liquid Dayquil.
10123539	10126940	and Let's Have Tea would just like to follow up the ever pleasant Let's Have Tea.
10127300	10128981	He did get a real car, a Corvette.
10130621	10131041	Forgiven.
10134102	10134542	Alright.
10135162	10142304	We're going to do a quickie break and when we come back we'll do a little bit of Ask Orange Lounge and then we're going to do the wrap up of the show.
10142344	10144505	So send questions now for Ask Orange Lounge.
10144965	10147105	And in this break, gotcha! ...
10235809	10237891	If you can't say goodbye
10278186	10288031	Baby, tell me why You don't wanna love me Just like I do You can't say goodbye Tell me what I've got to do If you can't say goodbye Baby, tell me why You don't wanna love me Just like I do You can't say goodbye Tell me
10328815	10332198	Rock over London, rock over Chicago, Orange Lounge Radio.
10332358	10334180	It's a good place to listen to the music.
10338623	10343708	We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio, and we're about ready to wrap up tonight's show.
10343748	10348592	But darn it, it's time for you guys to contribute a little something to this train wreck of a show.
10349112	10353316	So we're going to do a little bit of Ask Orange Lounge Radio.
10355575	10357135	And we're playing on the webcam right now, by the way.
10357175	10358336	I hope you guys are watching over there.
10358356	10358876	It's kind of fun.
10359056	10362317	www.orangeloungeradio.com Anyway, let's get into this week's Ask Orange Lounge.
10368938	10371839	Let's ask Orange Lounge some stupid question.
10372359	10375700	What will we find out this week on Orange Lounge Radio?
10376440	10379321	Is there a point to this segment?
10379841	10380661	I don't think so.
10380841	10383002	It's only here to fill a little time.
10389537	10393300	Question from RPGKing7.
10395082	10400006	Question is, what is everyone in the lounge's opinions of us Canadians?
10401066	10402287	What do we think of Canadians?
10404970	10405830	They're from Canada.
10408633	10411255	I know Loki's thinking of something horrible to say here.
10411335	10412696	I'm not thinking of anything horrible.
10412776	10414517	No, honestly, Canadians are cool.
10414537	10415298	They've got, you know...
10416125	10422888	Lacks their laws up there, it seems like, you know, and it's just, you know, it's a little cold for my taste, but... It's just cold.
10423128	10424789	It's just, you know, it's cool.
10424989	10427390	I mean, I don't have anything wrong against Canadians.
10427811	10429231	They got the gay marriage thing up there.
10429271	10430972	They're ahead of the game as far as I'm concerned.
10430992	10432353	They got that stuff going for them.
10432533	10434253	But here's my problem with Canada.
10434314	10441097	If I went to Canada, I'd be out of a job because I work in the healthcare industry, and they got the nationalized healthcare thing going on, so I'd be out of a job.
10441557	10441797	Well...
10442537	10447358	The only thing I don't like is French Canadians, but, you know, but that's just because I don't like French.
10447378	10449099	No one likes French Canadians.
10449139	10450499	That's not true.
10450519	10450959	I'm kidding.
10451119	10457241	So, I mean, there's, there's, hey, you know, Canada gave us Jim Carrey, you know.
10457261	10458681	And Alanis Morissette, my favorite.
10458962	10462343	Yeah, well, okay, they gave us Jim Carrey, and, um.
10462463	10462963	Shut up.
10464543	10470805	And, and, and they also gave us Tom, oh, wait, no, no, Tom Green, you can have Tom Green back, actually, um.
10472028	10474569	Dan says, too nice, too close, and too quiet.
10501127	10505388	The weird thing is they all live in Toronto, which is, I guess Toronto's where it's at.
10506889	10507369	Go Leafs.
10509769	10512510	Well, yeah, they have good musicians.
10513090	10513931	That's all I've got to say.
10515031	10516131	Shatner's Canadian?
10517212	10517772	Oh, God.
10517812	10521313	Rob already said Alanis Morissette, so I've got to say Very Naked Ladies, because, yeah.
10522333	10523393	Or Celine Dion?
10524273	10524654	Moving on.
10525234	10526614	Well, the game is Jim Carrey.
10527854	10528075	I know.
10528735	10529695	What about Bryan Adams?
10530274	10538096	Legend of Zaku says, Seeing that you guys are the drinking type, have you ever thought of creating some Bomani-themed cocktail drinks?
10540917	10550019	My fire, like Goldschlager and... Max 300, Goldschlager, Jägermeister, and 151 all mixed together.
10555381	10555761	I don't know.
10555821	10555961	No, I...
10558127	10558995	Murdoch Survivor
10562205	10562705	I don't know.
10563386	10565847	I imagine some dork out there has thought of something.
10566267	10568448	Maybe that's a thread we should start on the forums.
10568488	10570089	See what people can come up with.
10570349	10572590	You know, I have a friend who's going to bartending school.
10573031	10575812	So what I'll do is I will ask him to come up with some new drinks.
10576092	10577053	Maybe he's even listening.
10577313	10578433	He's starting bartending school this week.
10578733	10580614	I'll ask him to try and come up with some new drinks.
10581015	10583076	And when he tells me what's in it, I will give them names.
10583256	10584977	And we will come up with a Bomani drink.
10585077	10589019	We could use the one that I made with the orange juice and the Malibu.
10589099	10589719	I remember that.
10589759	10590299	That was pretty good.
10590319	10590739	That can be...
10592623	10620698	My Summer Love I was thinking the same thing Mikla Tav Dear Ask Orange Lounge Please make some E3 plans Alright, stop bugging me And Boom Boom Dollar was not on DER First Mix Meaning it had no basic step rating Hey buddy It was on US First Mix Which was basically just the Japanese First Mix imported Or 1.5 Mix
10623175	10627803	MPQ says, why do laptops make shitty gaming PCs?
10628384	10630288	DarkSakura, who has the laptop in her lap?
10630368	10630949	Care to answer?
10631570	10633333	I haven't actually tried to run any games on this.
10634036	10635518	Although I could install the Sims.
10635618	10648330	Actually, my laptop would probably be very good for gaming because I've got a GeForce in here and I've got a 3.06 processor.
10648830	10649171	Simple.
10649371	10652074	And a bunch of RAM.
10652314	10653475	Mine would run Final Fantasy XI.
10653855	10656638	I'm going to download the benchmark and see if my laptop would run Final Fantasy XI.
10656698	10658039	I think you should.
10658079	10658700	Just so I can laugh.
10659440	10669624	You know what, I think part of the problem, at least with older laptops, newer ones don't do this so much, but the older ones, like if you change the way you're looking at the screen, it gets lighter and darker, like it's just the way the display works.
10669684	10670485	It's this LCD screen.
10670525	10674206	Exactly, and that annoyed the shit out of me, but new ones don't really have that problem.
10674226	10674687	That's not a problem.
10674747	10675087	I know.
10675387	10677768	Mine really won't be running many games though, because it's for school.
10678308	10683430	The problem is that laptops are generation behind usually, and they're also very expensive.
10683590	10687152	Also, it says they're passively cooled, they don't have any actual fans inside of them.
10687632	10687832	and so on.
10712816	10713236	For the money.
10714517	10714838	Alright.
10715959	10716939	Let's see here.
10719021	10724586	Al Mullet wants to ask, As a future newbie to Beatmania 2DX, there are quite a few songs I haven't heard yet.
10724986	10726787	What would be your favorites to play?
10727408	10729229	Maybe one favorite song to play in 2DX.
10729530	10730771	Mine would be Deadline.
10730931	10733673	As horrid as that song is, I absolutely love that song.
10733713	10734514	Deadline, Fistyle.
10734954	10736756	I used to be really fond of playing Sync.
10737937	10740799	But now it would probably have to be... I actually really dig Holic.
10741480	10748142	On both levels, so... When you're first getting started and you're still playing 1-stars, Five Fathoms on 3rd style is pretty rad, and it has a random video.
10748162	10748942	Five Fathoms, that would be the one.
10748962	10751302	Five Fathoms is like the best song to learn on for 1-star.
10751322	10756003	Yeah, it's the one with the DDR in the video, like the old-ass DDR that had Boom Boom Dollar in it.
10757084	10757644	Mikhail Tov.
10760384	10762545	Let's see, we got a lot of questions in a little time.
10762565	10764405	I'm going to try and get through as many of these as we can.
10764445	10765886	You can still submit some, though, if you want.
10765926	10766646	I'm looking through some.
10767493	10772918	John Fields says, Hey Sky, why isn't this show or station listed on the Wikipedia?
10774260	10776142	I'm somewhat familiar with Wikipedia.
10776342	10779284	Is that like the user-created encyclopedia?
10779385	10784469	Kind of like, what do they call that Mozilla database of all the sites?
10784670	10785630	Free web or something?
10785650	10786351	Freezilla or something?
10786371	10788293	I found Mobile Alabama on the Wikipedia page.
10788753	10789193	You know what?
10789534	10792175	I just have no idea how to hook something like that up.
10792615	10800700	If somebody wants to send me an email and tell me how to do it, rob at orangeloungeradio.com or if you just want to submit it, as long as you don't talk shit about us, you have my blessings.
10801821	10804522	And I imagine DarkSakura and Loki feel the same way, yes?
10805843	10806263	Whatever.
10806424	10807204	Yeah, don't fuck it up.
10807244	10807864	That's all we ask.
10808845	10813888	Let's Have Tea would like to know, what is the highest score in Orange Lounge Radio Pinball?
10815697	10818941	Little known fact, before I got into DDR, I was a pinball whore.
10819182	10820163	I really loved pinball.
10820303	10821404	Rob was the pinball wizard.
10821424	10823347	He was blind and used to be called Tommy.
10826147	10826747	House of Magic
10850225	10851426	House of Magic's awesome too.
10851466	10853268	Those are probably two of the top tables out there.
10853988	10860834	Another one that I always liked was Pinbot, which is kind of a running joke on Outside the Box when it's actually on the air.
10861675	10863317	But Pinbot's a really cool one too.
10863377	10864117	I always liked that one.
10864257	10866680	And the NES version, not the same.
10866740	10867881	In fact, it's very much not the same.
10868361	10869242	What was I going to say?
10869662	10876448	My favorite time playing, what was it, Invasion of Mars or whatever that one was called, Return to Mars.
10877668	10879449	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
10905692	10908173	Because I was always really good at hitting the goal.
10911114	10921157	Dan and I, a little after I first moved out here, we used to go to Godfather's Pizza in Tomas and play Last Action Hero Pinball.
10921938	10922398	All the time.
10923538	10926439	Ooh, VXJSXV brings up a good point in the chat room.
10926879	10929180	Some PC pinball games that were actually really good.
10929700	10930441	Epic Pinball.
10931061	10932782	The Epic Pinball games were awesome.
10932922	10933762	You can get Pin Mame.
10935094	10936375	Pin Mame's not the same to me.
10936655	10938856	I would rather play Epic Pinball than Pin Mame.
10938916	10941278	Epic Pinball I bet's in a band and wear probably right now.
10941298	10941858	Probably.
10942319	10949543	As much as I think Pin Mame is an awesome idea and I totally support the project, it just, I don't know, it doesn't work for me.
10949943	10950303	It doesn't.
10952085	10956867	I think it's because I prefer the tables that were created for the PC, on a PC, if that makes any sense.
10958248	10960810	I don't know, there's some really good virtual tables there.
10962199	10969200	I used to have, and if anybody can think of this and private message me the pinball game that this was, I would love you forever.
10969800	10977782	There was a pinball game I used to have on my old ass PC, my 100 megahertz PC, and it had four tables in it.
10977962	10980062	One of them was like a haunted house, I think.
10980422	10981842	The other one was a raceway.
10982102	10983543	One of them was a circus.
10984343	10987543	And I remember the circus table was a demo you could download on the internet.
10987803	10990904	But then there was another one called like Billion Dollar Game Show or something.
10991761	10993382	It was a game and it had four tables.
10993502	10995203	It wasn't Epic, it was some other pinball game.
10995503	10998145	If I could find that again, I would be so happy.
10998225	10999886	Did Sierra make a pinball game?
10999966	11001006	I don't think it was Sierra either.
11001026	11002287	I think it was some other unknown company.
11003228	11015235	I talked to one of the people at E3 last year who said that they were working on a pinball game for the PS2 that was supposed to emulate a bunch of the old tables.
11015817	11022259	I want them to actually go to Capcom and produce the... It was when I had brought up on the show before that Dan showed me there's only like, I think, 16 of them in existence.
11041420	11041600	Dr. Dude
11072348	11073109	It was awful.
11076995	11077535	You know what?
11077616	11084505	Somebody in the chatroom is posting a suggestion for the game that they think it is.
11085586	11086287	It was Big Bang.
11086368	11087329	Thank you.
11088629	11092010	Hyper 3D Pinball I'm posting pictures of this table in the chat room.
11113562	11115163	But that's the one.
11115283	11122825	And they only made a few of them because this was in production right before Capcom's pinball division went out.
11125686	11126646	I want a pinball table.
11127946	11129407	I want a Black Knight 2000 machine.
11130767	11132868	Somebody's suggesting that maybe it's extreme pinball?
11137329	11140250	And yes, I will... Oh my gosh, I think this is it.
11145492	11146272	No, I don't think it is.
11146652	11149894	I think I have that game too, but that's not the one I'm thinking of.
11150755	11151155	Anyways.
11151395	11152215	I can't tell.
11152896	11154677	I'm so upset because I really want this.
11154697	11155597	You guys don't understand.
11155657	11156598	I want this game again.
11160280	11160720	Grr.
11160920	11161681	No, that's not it.
11161921	11162221	Darn it.
11162501	11162761	Oh well.
11163282	11163802	Maybe someday.
11165231	11166712	Okay, let's see.
11166792	11171353	What we're going to do now is we're going to go around and get everybody's... Oh, I'll do one more question really quick.
11172354	11173914	Sorry to those guys we didn't get to.
11174014	11175895	Illusion asks, Hey guys, I have a question.
11175955	11177456	What did you do for Valentine's Day?
11177496	11178976	Did you get shagged vigorously?
11180617	11182278	I had chocolate cheese pie.
11185299	11186599	I had dinner with my boy.
11186619	11190981	And then I went to school on actual Valentine's Day.
11195259	11200120	Alright, I made pasta, and then it got shagged vigorously.
11202280	11205801	I did not get shagged vigorously this Valentine's Day, but that's okay.
11206781	11208321	I can deal with rejection.
11211162	11213282	It's time to go around and get everybody's final thought.
11213342	11215523	Thank you guys for tuning in to Orange Lounge Radio tonight.
11215603	11217683	Let's start it off with Explicit.
11217723	11219103	Your final thought, please.
11219663	11220764	Jamie, get well soon.
11222524	11223364	Angel, your final thought.
11224741	11226563	Final Fantasy must workie, dang it.
11228224	11229145	Loki, your final thought.
11231127	11233008	I'm only down to two PCs now.
11233429	11234169	What am I to do?
11236611	11240775	My final thought is when will Outside the Box return?
11240815	11241396	Nobody knows.
11242637	11243798	DarkSakura, your final thought.
11244618	11246760	I want a Black Knight 2000 pinball machine.
11248522	11249222	That's it, guys.
11249242	11250063	Thanks for tuning in.
11250103	11251865	Check out our podcast, dammit.
11253103	11256224	DarkSakura, you can have tonight's final word.
11256244	11257045	Oh, final word.
11258245	11267309	The final word of the evening is... That does it for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio Live.
11268129	11272331	Orange Lounge Radio Live is an Orange Lounge Radio production.
11272831	11280214	For more information about our station, visit our website at www.orangeloungeradio.com
11281152	11285114	And now, here is your fortune cookie message of the day.
11314050	11321065	And now, the six merry murderesses of the Cook County Jail in their rendition of The Cell.Tales
11348599	11374688	Popsic Wishes Popsic Wishes He had it coming, he had it coming He only had himself to blame If you'd have been there, if you'd have seen it I bet you you would have done the same Popsic Wishes Popsic Wishes
11380401	11383262	You know how people have these little habits that get you down?
11383982	11385603	Like, Bernie.
11386163	11387624	Bernie likes to chew gum.
11388324	11389185	No, not chew.
11390005	11390605	Ha.
11391606	11396128	So I came home this one day and I'm really irritated and I'm looking for a little bit of sympathy.
11396528	11400790	And there's Bernie, lying on the couch, drinking a beer and chewing.
11400910	11402451	No, not chewing.
11404450	11410892	And he did.
11411793	11420195	So I took the shotgun off the wall and I fired two warning shots into his head.
11421255	11422396	He had it coming.
11422616	11423256	He had it coming.
11442640	11446022	I met Ezekiel Young from Salt Lake City about two years ago.
11446542	11447823	And he told me he was single.
11448463	11449844	And we hit it off right away.
11450405	11451645	So we started living together.
11452246	11453746	He'd go to work, he'd come home.
11454347	11456428	I'd fix him a drink, we'd have dinner.
11457269	11458589	And then I found out.
11459970	11460911	Single, he told me.
11461551	11462932	Single, my ass.
11463492	11464733	Not only was he married.
11465213	11465613	Oh, no.
11466214	11467434	He had six wives.
11468475	11469576	One of those Mormons, you know.
11470879	11475482	So that night when he came home from work, I fixed him his drink, as usual.
11477663	11481064	You know, some guys just can't hold their arsenic.
11482005	11487688	He had it coming, he had it coming, he took the power and it was right.
11487788	11492931	And then he used it, and he abused it, it was a murder, another microchip.
11497841	11502745	Now I'm standing in the kitchen, carving up the chicken for dinner, minding my own business.
11503186	11505648	In storms my husband, Wilbur, in a jealous rage.
11506448	11507950	You've been screwing the milkman, he said.
11508370	11509211	He was crazy.
11509671	11512233	And he kept on screaming, you've been screwing the milkman.
11513134	11514695	And then he ran into my knife.
11515556	11517718	He ran into my knife ten times.
11527208	11528409	Yeah, but did you do it?
11528429	11528529	Uh-uh.
11528549	11528909	Not guilty.
11558951	11561253	My sister Veronica and I had this double act.
11561933	11563795	And my husband Charlie traveled around with us.
11564715	11569158	Now for the last number in our act, we did these 20 acrobatic tricks in a row.
11569178	11574362	1, 2, 3, 4, 5, splits, spread eagles, backflips, flip flops, one right after the other.
11575305	11582434	So this one night before the show, we're down at the Hotel Cicero, the three of us boozing, having a few laughs.
11583435	11586359	And we run out of ice, so I go out to get some.
11586840	11589023	I come back, open the door.
11590229	11595955	and there is Veronica and Charlie doing number 17, the Sporad Eagle.
11597557	11599579	Well, I was in such a state of shock.
11600119	11601281	I completely blacked out.
11601341	11602442	I can't remember a thing.
11603062	11608228	It wasn't until later when I was washing the blood off my hands, I even knew they were dead.
11609249	11610250	They had it coming.
11610290	11611111	They had it coming.
11611131	11612172	They had it coming.
11615018	11616800	Thank you for watching!
11641512	11643833	I loved Al Lipschitz more than I could possibly say.
11644453	11645874	He was a real artistic guy.
11646554	11647115	Sensitive.
11647695	11648175	A painter.
11648975	11650756	But he was always trying to find himself.
11651357	11659541	He'd go out every night looking for himself, and on the way, he found Ruth, Gladys, Rosemary, and Irvings.
11660444	11662686	I guess you could say we broke up because of artistic differences.
11663607	11667230	He saw himself as alive, and I saw him dead.
11699716	11701537	You popped that gum one more time.
11701577	11703937	Number 17, the spread eagle.
11704017	11704277	Pop.
11704317	11704497	Six.
11704517	11704858	Squish.
11704878	11705078	Uh-uh.
11705098	11705278	Cicero.
11729531	11733043	Thank you very much for listening and we'll see you next week.
11763106	11763946	Okay, we figured it out.
11764026	11766687	It's either Pinball Dreams or Pinball Fantasies.
11766727	11768208	They're both made by the same developer.
11768228	11768928	They're very similar.
11768948	11770168	So I'm going to check them both out.
11770548	11771989	That was it, though.
11772089	11774730	When I do the image search in Google, I get the images of the game I remember.
11775050	11778711	So, thank you, Jason, for helping me find that out.
11779111	11779831	So I'm very happy.
11780151	11782352	It's either Pinball Dreams or Pinball Fantasies.
11782572	11783633	One is the sequel to the other.
11784473	11785173	So, that was it.
11785193	11786874	Now people can help me find Konami World.
11786914	11787474	I'll be happy.
11787514	11789975	This is the cool thing about Pinball Dreams and Pinball Fantasies.
11791455	11792396	Excuse me, I choked on a peanut.
11792796	11794577	They use mod music.
11794857	11797138	The music is all mod files, which is awesome.
11798099	11799419	Well, good luck finding Konami World.
11800080	11800520	Miss Jamie.
11802261	11803322	Alright, that's gonna do it.
11803342	11806984	We're gonna log off now so we can take care of that podcast.
11807304	11807764	Thank you guys.
