464056	468178	The Oscar goes to me for being so great.
469018	472199	Also joining us... I'm sorry, you can't win the Oscar because you didn't get naked.
472319	473779	I did not get naked this year.
474099	475820	I might tonight, however.
476840	477060	No.
478781	480722	I'm getting the old thumbs up from our special guest.
480982	484923	Who we will get to momentarily after we introduce... Loki, TechMassa.
485343	487604	I have corn on one side and rice on the other.
489437	491879	That sounds like a very interesting porno I want.
491939	492299	Never mind.
496962	509890	Also joining us tonight, say hello to our very special guest, who, believe it or not, in 133 weeks of Orange Lounge Radio, has never been to a live show, I do not believe.
509970	510130	No?
510230	511051	Was there one other time?
512111	515393	There was the tournament, and then there was when I did it at the house.
516034	516134	Oh.
516969	520051	Okay, but that's never been here at the Orange Lounge Studios.
520071	520532	No, not here.
521793	521973	Alright.
522153	523234	So make sure the mic's on, bud.
523614	525315	Make sure it's in the on position.
525516	525776	Really?
526016	526857	Into the microphone.
526877	527337	Hello.
527537	528138	Oh, there you go.
528258	529839	Say hello to Dan!
532441	534622	And why is Dan so special, DarkSakura?
536124	537385	Uh, because we're getting married one day.
537405	538846	Because I rock.
539726	541908	Dan is DarkSakura's hetero life mate.
542842	544763	Yes, my head went like this.
546103	551665	So this should be a very interesting show because now I have someone to gang up on Jamie with.
551705	552766	This is going to be fantastic.
553066	557367	Yeah, but when we get home, Dan's ass is going to be kicked.
557387	560148	You'd like to think that, wouldn't you?
560188	561168	He got second five.
561228	561809	I'll school you.
563382	567125	Loki, you're too busy eating on this show always to make fun of Jamie with me.
567145	567665	No, I'm kidding.
568186	570988	I can't make fun of Jamie because she kicks my ass and makes me cry.
572929	577973	Anyway, we will be back shortly after a quick break to kick things off in tonight's show.
578474	582817	During tonight's show, by the way, we're going to have a brand new song premiere for you guys.
583297	586119	Those of you guys with Xboxes, I'm sure you already heard this one.
586159	588761	It's the brand new In My Eyes mix from Song Pack 8.
589402	591984	But if you haven't had a chance to hear it yet, you're going to.

992685	993325	Thank you for watching!
1021058	1022579	I'd like to accept this award.
1023859	1025780	And I'd like to thank my mother and my father.
1025800	1027341	This world is shit!
1029241	1031582	That was the best acceptance speech of all time.
1031983	1035504	When Fiona Apple got up there and said, she was drunk off her ass.
1035544	1038625	This is like what the MTV Awards, what, like 10 years ago almost at this point?
1038965	1041426	She gets up there, oh my god, was that really 10 years ago?
1042127	1042387	Yeah.
1042627	1044448	I'm so old!
1045088	1047149	I was living here when it happened.
1047409	1048089	Oh, okay, good.
1049230	1049450	Phew.
1049470	1050050	Yeah, maybe...
1050819	1051139	Jamey
1079878	1080419	Start us off.
1080459	1080919	How was your week?
1080939	1081320	How was your day?
1096111	1097632	I know, I'm just... We need to fix this.
1099753	1114442	This is why I can't watch the Oscars, even though they call it the Gay Man Super Bowl, and if you hadn't heard the little rumor going around about me, even though they call it the Gay Man Super Bowl, I can't watch this program because I don't see any of the movies, like ever.
1115302	1120105	I think this year I've seen two of the movies, which is like more than ever.
1121506	1123307	I would have to second that.
1123407	1124988	I don't really go to the movies that much anymore.
1125069	1127690	And when I do go to the movies, I usually see like foreign shit.
1128491	1131113	I usually pick a movie and then see it a bajillion times.
1131153	1132734	Like, I saw Phantom of the Opera twice.
1135335	1139198	Well, see, I saw Rocky Horror Picture Show like 200 and something times.
1140198	1145702	If I have to see another period piece starring Leonardo DiCaprio, I am going to scream.
1148304	1149905	Or fucking Dame Judi Dench.
1150720	1153882	Dame Judi Dench in every period piece there ever was.
1153923	1155103	There's Dame Judi Dench.
1155444	1158786	Don't get me wrong, Dame Judi Dench is a great actress, but damn.
1159767	1160127	My week.
1160528	1161048	Oh yeah, sorry.
1162149	1163630	My week was spent in a coma.
1165331	1169474	Well, more like being half in a coma and half playing Final Fantasy XI.
1170055	1172457	Because I did not have the energy to move out of my chair.
1174518	1175379	It'll do that to you.
1176540	1176700	No.
1176720	1176760	No.
1177666	1180808	I, um, I basically ran a fever.
1181228	1182709	The highest it was when I checked was 103.
1182969	1189413	And, uh, it's like Friday, like Saturday, I stopped running a fever.
1190353	1191193	I went to the doctor.
1191574	1193575	She said, your ass ain't going to work.
1194795	1206922	And basically I had some type of viral infection that almost became, she said that it was leaving me very open to bacteria and that it was basically settled in my sinuses and the head.
1207762	1208202	Microphone.
1237968	1243670	Um, and, uh, yeah.
1243690	1246192	Um, and, uh, what else did I do?
1246252	1249213	Oh, yeah, yesterday we cleaned our room and found the floor.
1250593	1252554	We threw away, like, two years worth of crap.
1254455	1258296	Um, I got disconnected from the chat room.
1259677	1260137	Shut up!
1262018	1266600	Um, but I also, uh,
1268611	1269592	What else did I do?
1270633	1273394	Oh yeah, today we went and bought like lots of stuff.
1274675	1275416	And had dinner.
1275436	1276436	And that was it.
1276656	1277397	And it got second five!
1279578	1283121	Which is, even though I haven't played the home version yet, the most awesome game in the world.
1285502	1285822	That's it.
1287283	1288324	Alright, Loki!
1289625	1291046	I know you're trying to eat, but it's your turn.
1291086	1291546	How was your week?
1291566	1292066	How was your day?
1292647	1295949	So anyways... I was chewing...
1297341	1298321	and then stuff happened.
1299041	1299181	No.
1301742	1305683	Right now, since I had sort of like lunch for breakfast, I'm having breakfast for dinner.
1306543	1308204	You know, just to kind of balance things out.
1308284	1309924	You're having a dyslexic meal day.
1311044	1311624	Exactly.
1312945	1315785	I'm having, you know, it's actually pretty good for me.
1316105	1316766	Crispix.
1317886	1318686	It's damn good.
1318986	1321887	And, you know, I've already eaten half the box.
1322207	1322967	Holy crap.
1323867	1324707	There's not much in there.
1325928	1326848	Anyways, um,
1327418	1328879	So, yeah, this week, what did I do?
1329059	1332460	Okay, to start things off, first off, computer was out of commission.
1332700	1334300	We do remember that on Sunday.
1335661	1336241	It was gone.
1336261	1341223	I was like, you know, I can wait a week until I get paid next to fix it.
1341743	1344004	It's okay.
1344084	1346965	The next day... So, I watched Robot Chicken.
1347485	1349746	Robot Chicken is fucking hilarious.
1349846	1352326	I don't normally endorse television programs.
1352386	1354787	However, I will endorse Robot Chicken.
1354947	1355307	Tonight, 11.30.
1355548	1356848	Fucking comedy.
1357954	1360396	Cartoon Network, Best 15 Minutes of Your Life
1381514	1387179	I honestly, I'm glad it was only 15 minutes long, because I was laughing so hard, I probably would have passed out if it was any longer.
1387299	1388760	So, it was great.
1390161	1397848	Then, because remember, you have organic internal organs, and you can get cancer.
1399409	1399710	Anyways.
1402147	1404949	Everybody who saw Robot Chicken is kind of chuckling.
1404969	1407591	They're not really laughing because it wasn't that funny, but they're chuckling a little bit.
1407911	1410993	Anybody who didn't see it is going, Loki, shut up.
1411694	1412795	I don't get you.
1414136	1423742	So anyway, the rest of the week was filled with watching... Well, actually just playing Final Fantasy XI.
1424763	1430807	And I tried actually playing Final Fantasy XII, but then I realized that for some reason...
1431673	1432514	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1458499	1466146	I actually played the guy game last night with Loki and his girlfriend and one of Loki's other friends.
1466847	1470890	And my friend Christopher was just kind of sitting in the corner playing DS going, what's wrong with you people?
1471651	1472812	But I was playing the guy game.
1473813	1475895	I owned at the guy game.
1476295	1477056	I'd just like to point out.
1477997	1478878	Did you get boobies?
1479818	1482100	I got my girl to give me a lap dance at the end.
1483322	1484823	Except my girl looked like a dude.
1488424	1489305	So I was right.
1490866	1494329	But, I mean, she looked okay when it wasn't like a still photo of her.
1494369	1496531	When she was kind of in motion, she looked alright.
1497051	1499553	But the still photos did not do that girl justice.
1499573	1502135	It was like somewhere between Tori Spelling and Bea Arthur.
1502815	1504637	Seriously, there was this one picture of her.
1505518	1507139	What was the name of the model in the game?
1507499	1508040	I don't remember.
1508960	1510021	She's the one that looks like a horse.
1511322	1512923	We didn't know Chyna was in the guy game.
1515245	1516086	So anyways, yes.
1516445	1517045	So we did that.
1517165	1523969	I went and played some horse crack because I had to get rid of some of my tokens left over from that horrible place called Golfland.
1524790	1528211	And I still, you know, my boycott still exists.
1528251	1532754	I just have to get rid of these tokens so that I'm rid of their evil.
1534015	1538817	But I have to say, I eat children, my horse, in derby crack.
1539618	1540198	Kickin' ass.
1540878	1543920	And what else did I do?
1543960	1545121	Well, that's pretty much it.
1545261	1545801	Just kind of
1546283	1551125	You know, I retired a horse, like, in two days.
1552545	1554406	When they got Doc over there.
1555206	1556107	This is so weird.
1556127	1560468	I haven't really been to Golf Land in, like, I don't know, four months.
1561169	1565110	I hear Country Club Lanes has In The Groove, but I'm too lazy to go over there and play it.
1565879	1567360	What the hell am I doing this show for?
1567840	1568160	I don't know.
1568560	1571141	But, honestly, they had a new Sega shooter there.
1571181	1572001	That was kind of neat.
1572201	1573162	That game is awesome.
1573582	1574822	I didn't actually get to see it.
1575003	1575323	Yeah.
1575543	1576623	That game is really fun.
1576663	1577343	Dan and I played it.
1577684	1579224	I didn't really get to play anything else.
1579624	1586287	No, I'm really just, you know, DDR is kind of getting old as far as, you know, there's not been really new coming out.
1586827	1590268	And I'm starting to, like, take interest in the other arcade games again.
1590308	1591629	You know, back, you know, where...
1592102	1599583	When I was in the DDRs, kind of like, other arcade games, eh, fuck them, you know, I'm just playing DDR, you know, where now... DDR's got a line.
1600984	1602064	Yeah, that was it, actually.
1602084	1604464	There was a ton of people standing around the damn thing.
1604944	1606985	Is DDR going through a renaissance right now?
1607045	1609885	Because, like, there's fucking tons of people always playing it.
1610325	1613626	When I'm actually, when I am at an arcade... No one's playing Derby Owners Club at all.
1614326	1616506	Maybe one other person, that's why I came in second and third.
1616686	1619987	Extreme is what, like, two and a half years old now, and it's still...
1621394	1622355	Getting these huge crowds.
1623135	1623756	And Max too.
1623856	1624276	Crazy.
1624316	1625697	There is more people on Max too.
1626078	1629620	Probably that's because the extreme pads are fucked up.
1629760	1631602	I went and played Guitar Freaks yesterday.
1632842	1637246	One, my left hand hurt like a bitch because I'm just not used to playing it anymore.
1637826	1641689	Guess I gotta start masturbating with my left hand now, you know, to get it used to that kind of stuff.
1642069	1646292	But their fucking green button on there was messed up.
1646513	1647093	It was like...
1647897	1650018	Damn that fucking green button!
1650038	1652798	Seriously, I was failing songs because of it!
1653598	1654258	Fuck them!
1654779	1655919	And their crappy stuff.
1656439	1664181	Yeah, I guess, you know, they got tired of... They wanted to save money, apparently, because, you know, after all, they ripped me off on money, so why not?
1664341	1665841	Let's just not fix anything.
1666881	1673403	I hear they're actually gonna get a fourth DDR machine, which'll be in the groove, so... That's rumored.
1674503	1675383	Fuck them, anyways.
1676067	1681905	It's another machine they won't maintain I'm done Well
1682816	1684937	My week and my day was pretty good.
1684997	1690298	I mean, gosh, Loki already kind of hit on some of the stuff I wanted to talk about, like the guy game thing going on last night.
1690358	1691018	That was kind of fun.
1691738	1698200	And, you know, just kind of went out earlier this week, and I've been busy with work, though.
1698240	1700861	It's had me really exhausted, so I've been just napping a whole lot.
1701241	1706022	Been playing a lot of Final Fantasy XI, of course, and boy, did I just hit my point of frustration today.
1706883	1708003	I just want to quit that game.
1709932	1710612	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1732233	1733574	Final Fantasy II Final Fantasy II
1749775	1753897	But I got sick of Final Fantasy 1, so I want to get back into Final Fantasy 2 and see what it's really all about.
1754577	1757118	Because I know very little about the game and the story.
1757218	1758719	I mean, I know bits and pieces here and there.
1759059	1764982	And I recognized the song in the beginning, because everybody knows that Imperial March song that's in Final Fantasy 2.
1766422	1767003	So that was cool.
1768403	1771605	And, gosh, outside of that, not really a whole lot.
1773045	1775866	I'm not that exciting this week, or any week, to be honest.
1776327	1776927	It's kind of sad.
1779085	1779665	Let's move on.
1780186	1783848	Dan, would you like to share with us how your week is and how your day is going and all that stuff?
1785289	1787070	I had to deal with a sick Jamie all week.
1787970	1790872	I'm sure you can all relate with how much fun that is.
1790992	1793113	Do you give her a bell when she's sick?
1793173	1794294	Like she can ring a bell?
1794574	1795815	Yeah, that's all she needs.
1797716	1799117	Another way to make more noise.
1801362	1802483	No, actually, it was pretty good.
1802523	1809185	I took a bunch of days off this week, which turned out to be good timing, because even though she was sick, it let me spend a lot of time at home with Jamie, and we had fun.
1810165	1812386	Aww.
1812846	1816408	Well, you know, I managed to get her to clean the bedroom, which, you know, five years.
1816528	1818328	Not two years, five years.
1818729	1822130	We unpacked stuff I hadn't seen since I packed it before we moved into that apartment.
1822190	1822690	It was bad.
1824350	1827092	I'm going to be moving in April and I'm very much dreading it.
1827992	1829173	Oh god, it's going to suck.
1829994	1832515	I swear to god I'm going to call 1-800-JUNK.
1832536	1833876	1-800-GARBAGE.
1833896	1835037	1-800-GET-JUNK or whatever it is.
1835818	1837319	GOT-JUNK.
1837339	1838060	1-800-GOT-TOLD.
1839461	1842923	Haven't had a lot of chance to do a lot of gaming, which is kind of bizarre since I've been at home all week.
1844244	1849348	Sucks, but hey, what are you going to do?
1849608	1850929	Oh yeah, it's cool, it's cool.
1852941	1857144	GameStop, Marconi, buy all your Dance Dance stuff from us.
1883380	1885561	I have like 15 ignition pads, okay?
1885721	1886982	I need somebody to buy them.
1887442	1893765	I'm coming on this show because I need you guys to buy ignition pads from the GameStop on Marconi.
1894005	1895886	You go to any other GameStop, it doesn't fucking help me.
1897427	1899308	You gotta buy them from me, please.
1899468	1900668	I sold five in one week.
1901088	1903209	The company said, oh, fuck, these things are hot.
1903389	1906071	Sent me like seven cases of them.
1906531	1907551	There's two per case.
1908472	1909372	I can't get rid of them.
1910033	1910353	They're $100 a piece.
1911488	1912969	I saw the $20 ones, like, they're going out of style.
1913049	1914230	Someone buy an ignition pad, please.
1915150	1917331	You know, I went to GameStop to buy an ignition pad once.
1917351	1917811	It wasn't yours.
1918272	1920233	Um, but... Yeah, yeah, yeah.
1920453	1921293	You see how that works?
1921774	1922134	Fucker.
1923114	1925215	Are you doing another GameStop to buy an ignition pad?
1926036	1927036	Now I'm taking over your show.
1927377	1929558	I needed an ignition pad now.
1929678	1930999	At least I went to GameStop.
1932519	1932780	Yeah.
1933320	1934601	Because that really helps me.
1935221	1935601	I'm sorry.
1935621	1937522	I thought there was this whole corporate synergy thing going on.
1937542	1938903	At least I supported your opposition.
1938923	1940043	You see, they make us compete.
1940083	1940984	We fight to the death.
1941997	1946781	And I usually win because, let's be honest, the rest of the GameStop managers in this area, posers.
1947942	1952746	But really, by Ignition Pad, GameStop, Marconi and Fulton.
1952786	1954327	Marconi and Fulton, yes.
1954387	1957750	So if you disagree with Dan's comments, come see him in person.
1957770	1958310	Come on by.
1958330	1960932	I mean, I'm already on the webcam.
1960952	1961653	You know what I look like.
1961673	1962834	You ain't going to miss me.
1965436	1969399	If you're in the Sacramento area, you are hereby obligated to shop at my store.
1970228	1973210	Get all this Dance Dance crap out of my store.
1974110	1976272	I'll get new Dance Dance crap and that's fine.
1978833	1985097	You know, I went into your competing game stop once and I went and bought a new ignition pad.
1985457	1991281	And they were like, Whoa, you're actually buying an ignition pad?
1992082	1994303	I don't think I've ever seen anyone buy one.
1995824	1996404	Wow.
1997685	1998986	Are you sure that's what you want?
1999788	2001949	I'm like, way to sell it, buddy, way to sell it.
2002530	2006572	Aren't you supposed to ask me if I want to pre-order the next fucking pad or something?
2006852	2009573	Well, it's because of my involvement with you guys and with Jamie.
2010073	2013015	I know how shit-hot the ignition pad is supposed to be.
2013155	2017217	I've never used one, but I know it's supposed to be frickin' unbelievable.
2018358	2025261	If you're going to play DDR at home, seriously, at all, you should spend the money and get one.
2025501	2027823	Because the $20 pads ain't worth your time.
2028123	2028623	No, no, they suck.
2030017	2033620	But yeah, so I pimped a bunch of them one week and we were feeling real good about that.
2034341	2036102	Boom rang around, bit me in the ass.
2036262	2037183	Come buy ignition pads.
2037583	2042087	From me, please.
2043068	2045409	I have these pads over here that I don't even use.
2047111	2047651	So sad.
2048212	2049653	Use them with your sick ass arcade machines.
2049935	2051836	I do use them with my sick-ass arcade machine.
2052136	2059680	My problem is the sick-ass static electricity that's created by the sick-ass Lexin that's in there.
2059700	2069145	It kind of fries my sick-ass keyboard encoder board, and that doesn't work very well.
2069526	2069946	Static.
2070226	2070866	It'll stop you.
2071867	2075449	So I need to ground those pads, and then we'll be all good.
2077485	2079566	God damn it, they were expensive enough to build.
2080367	2082007	I don't need to be buying anymore.
2083048	2083488	No more.
2085549	2085869	Anyways.
2087190	2092372	And besides, the whole reason I built the cabinet and these pads is so I didn't have to go back to Golf Land.
2092432	2095914	Now they've just, you know, finalized that by trying to rip me off.
2096494	2098715	So, perfect.
2099156	2100636	It's all coming to play.
2100956	2103918	The purpose of GameStop is to rip people off and kill their soul.
2107922	2110243	We sell the GameStop or MovieStop.
2112144	2112444	Yeah.
2113284	2113564	Wait, wait.
2113584	2115945	There's actually a company called MovieStop now?
2116845	2119226	I saw them in Alabama.
2119606	2121627	They're kicking the idea around for out here.
2122007	2128589	Yeah, and they're buying games, or not games, but they're movies for their GameStops also from us.
2128829	2135611	We have a person that works in my key accounts department that doesn't know shit about anything, and he sells to them.
2136258	2149546	Ironically, when I was in Mobile, there was one right next door to an EB.
2151207	2156711	GameStop, on one hand, is an evil empire, but on the other hand, you need to get rid of those ignition pads, so come to the GameStop.
2157191	2158632	Hey, they're an evil empire, but...
2159520	2160362	They pay our bills.
2160442	2161324	At least they're not Walmart.
2161344	2162366	Yeah, now that's an evil empire.
2162486	2163228	A giant evil empire.
2170956	2176998	You know what, Starbucks is an evil empire too, but that doesn't make Frappuccino's taste any less, you know, yeah, seriously.
2177018	2181380	I mean, Starbucks, actually, from what I understand, Starbucks treats its employees pretty well.
2181500	2183721	I know people that work at Starbucks and they have nice things to say about it.
2183741	2186081	My understanding is that Starbucks managers make bank.
2186341	2188342	Yeah, so Starbucks... Stock options.
2188362	2193744	But yet people hate Starbucks because it's killing all the independent coffee shops or whatever.
2193864	2195805	Dude, did you ever go to an independent coffee shop?
2196972	2197513	No, you didn't.
2197673	2198433	Actually, I did.
2198633	2199014	Shut up.
2199094	2200735	You're screwing up my argument.
2200795	2201115	I did.
2201296	2203117	I did, but... Okay, did you go to it a lot?
2203838	2204678	No, I didn't go to it a lot.
2204718	2205759	Have you gone to Starbucks more?
2205799	2207881	The independent coffee shop did not have a drive-thru.
2209142	2209402	Yeah.
2209702	2223373	And that's really the clincher for Starbucks, is that if I can drive home and pick up a mocha latte frappalotta coffee chocino thing... They didn't have drive-thrus, and they weren't in the mall.
2224013	2225993	If you work at the mall, you drink Starbucks.
2226254	2227814	It's because they pump something through the air.
2228634	2231775	I don't drink Starbucks, but when I worked at the mall, I drank Starbucks like a fucking fiend.
2231935	2233815	Could it be the smell of coffee in the air?
2234295	2234996	No, it's not.
2235736	2238056	The mall doesn't smell like... You go to the mall, does it smell like coffee?
2238396	2239977	Subliminal messages in the music.
2240577	2241097	It is funny, though.
2241117	2244458	If you get ice water from Starbucks and you drink it, it tastes like coffee.
2246418	2247459	I'm friggin' serious, man.
2247499	2247799	Try it.
2247999	2248419	Just try it.
2249419	2251940	And they won't turn you down because it's like a corporate mandate from Starbucks.
2251980	2253580	If you ask for water, they gotta give you water.
2256100	2264828	I hate it when I go into places and you ask for water, and this is especially bad at places that have a DDR machine, i.e.
2264948	2266330	Roseville Golf Land.
2266770	2267170	Sucks!
2267511	2274337	You want to go and you go to play DDR and then you work up a sweat and you want to go get a nice glass of ice water.
2275398	2277840	That'll be 25 cents for the cup.
2279441	2280242	What if you bring your own cup?
2282705	2284546	Then they won't do it.
2285046	2287368	No, probably not, because they'll claim it's unsanitary.
2287548	2288168	I haven't tried it.
2288449	2291070	I just end up going off in a huff to the drinking fountain.
2291450	2293231	I'm like, you bastards, I'm pumping it up.
2293251	2294612	That drinking fountain is scary.
2294772	2296934	It's got, like, gum and, like, tobacco.
2296954	2297614	Seriously.
2297674	2298435	It's like, what the crap?
2298475	2298715	Yeah.
2301036	2303157	There's no way in hell I'm going to win my Oscar pool.
2303438	2306019	I, like, lost, like, the last three or four or five.
2307100	2307700	Ah, damn it.
2308401	2310582	Anyways, sorry to derail that whole train.
2311621	2313262	You poor, poor bastard.
2313382	2314622	Anyway, back to me.
2320484	2320844	I don't know.
2320864	2321444	Let's go to break.
2323085	2324245	Do we get to break things on break?
2325506	2330507	Possibly, because the music that we're going to play might be something that you want to break some stuff to.
2330848	2331748	If it's solitary.
2332739	2334160	No, actually it's going to be athletics.
2334520	2334960	Woohoo!
2335380	2338962	And some folks wanted to hear War Game, so I was going to indulge that request.
2339042	2340303	I vote for Disco Dog.
2340523	2344505	We will get Disco Dog in there as well, and some other athletic favorite songs.
2345105	2348086	And then we're going to come back, and we're going to talk a little bit about Bomani.
2349467	2349887	No!
2350147	2351548	Yeah, we got news.
2351768	2353529	We got big Guitadora news.
2353869	2354530	Big news!
2355350	2357731	And we also have big Ultramix 2 stuff.
2358572	2359572	Even more woo.
2360272	2361253	That earns a squeeze.
2362498	2366160	Now, are the ignition pads the PlayStation 2 and Xbox kind that have both?
2366180	2368321	Yeah, they're the dual compatibilities.
2368561	2371783	Because you know what's funny is that when this DDR... I don't think they make the single ones anymore.
2372083	2381468	I don't think they do either, but you know what's funny is that if this Dance Dance Revolution with Mario comes out in the US, which we all expect it will, they'll have to have new ignition pads that have all three.
2382469	2390233	Incidentally, while we're on the subject of Dance Dance Revolution with Mario, which needs to come out because the videos are hilarious, has anybody here played that
2392604	2411843	MC Groove's Dance Beat I have never sold a copy They sent me some, we put a box out, we had them sitting around People look at it, they see the box, they run away screaming
2412401	2413021	Who released it?
2413361	2414542	THQ or something?
2415022	2416362	All I can say is send it back.
2417142	2418063	I can't send it back.
2418563	2421323	The company store, they send me the shit they want in it.
2421343	2425985	Then you need to go put it on their doorstep and ring the doorbell and run.
2426005	2426825	And light it on fire.
2428485	2432206	Then when they step in it like the burning Coleco plastic, they'll be like, no!
2433247	2433887	It's pretty bad.
2434867	2436028	It's really, really bad.
2436048	2438450	It's actually by Mad Catz, the same company.
2438470	2439411	That's right, Mad Catz.
2439431	2441694	The same company that makes those $20 dance pads.
2442374	2443235	The beat pad.
2446419	2450443	Because after you play with them, you want to beat yourself with a stick, honestly.
2451303	2451783	It's bad.
2451863	2453583	It has the full versions of songs.
2453843	2457504	And you'd think that would be a good thing because I was like, parents just don't understand and stuff.
2457564	2460245	But there's really nothing else to it.
2460385	2465426	I mean, besides the somewhat interesting music, the steps don't make any sense at all.
2466086	2470247	And the visuals leave a lot to be desired.
2470387	2477448	The entire game without the music is probably about the size where it would fit on a three and a half inch floppy disk.
2479807	2481488	to use in your GameCube floppy drive.
2483750	2485672	Anyway, let's go to break.
2485692	2487193	We're going to start it off with some more game.
2487233	2489555	We'll be back after this with more Orange Lounge Radio.
2492037	2493359	Orange Lounge Radio
2532638	2534719	How many people can think about it?
2534759	2537120	No matter who you are, however you want to be.
2537140	2540221	This is the end of a galaxy, no one but an enemy.
2540361	2542562	Brought to you guys from the gods who are in this.
2542582	2543943	Everybody who I have to kill.

2883167	2884448	Thank you for watching!
2926209	2929752	Orange Lounge Radio.
2931933	2934335	We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio.
2934595	2941079	During the break there, Dan was talking to me about a little bit of the celebrity that he gets from being the dude from GameStop.
2941640	2943221	What was some of the stuff you were telling me?
2943281	2945062	You get harassed in restaurants and things?
2945723	2946163	Well, it was
2946806	2952249	We just got an IM, or a message, from someone who thought that they knew who I was.
2952409	2952629	Right.
2953289	2953890	You don't know me.
2957152	2963015	But it's like, you manage a video game store, and you're shocked because you see all these people come through your store.
2963275	2965056	And some of them you get to know because they come in lots.
2965116	2967197	Some of them you start to dread seeing.
2967717	2969078	And you know who I'm talking to if you're listening.
2970368	2972289	You're not listening, I know.
2973589	2978170	And sometimes, it's like you can be, I was a thousand miles from home.
2978490	2979290	I was at E3.
2979950	2982611	Some guy walks up to me and he's like, I know you from somewhere.
2983251	2984731	I'm like, you should know me, I'm famous.
2985491	2986671	Do you know me?
2986891	2987992	I am so famous.
2990452	2995253	But he figured out who I was and he ran into me again and he's like, you're the guy from GameStop.
2995816	3002193	And I'm thinking, wow, this guy's probably been sitting here that whole goddamn show, three days of video games, thinking, why the hell did I know that guy first?
3003668	3010871	You've been in that position, though, haven't you, before, where you swear to God you recognize somebody and you can't think of where you know them from, and it just preys on your mind.
3011071	3013372	It's obvious, and like I said, it's just I thought it was pathetic.
3013792	3017433	It wasn't like I was trying to think of someone who might have been a childhood friend or a grade school buddy.
3017753	3020894	This was the guy who came to me and bought Final Fantasy two weeks ago.
3021114	3023775	Dude, you delivered my pizza once.
3024935	3027756	Damn, you didn't bring me any peppers.
3028156	3029257	You bastard.
3032335	3033656	So yeah, it's freaky freaky.
3034156	3043223	I used to get that sometimes back when I did Rocky Horror Picture Show and I was still around and I was emceeing and I would do the big beginning where we had like the virgin sacrifice, you know.
3043523	3044704	Everyone knows who Rob is anyway.
3044724	3046666	Big dumb fun, well, whatever.
3046866	3048827	I've had people walk up to me and be like, you know Rob, don't you?
3049508	3049908	Shut up.
3049928	3052330	Duh.
3052790	3058915	No, but I would be at the mall or something and these girls would walk by me and go like, you're the guy who took my virginity.
3064986	3067667	I'm like, don't say that with your mother there!
3071869	3072729	Trust me, it wasn't me.
3072829	3073790	Bye!
3077872	3078552	That's no good.
3079092	3079953	I've had that happen.
3080633	3081753	I'm just like, oh my god.
3083634	3085415	Tell your mother you mean you're Rocky.
3085955	3087496	What were you doing after midnight?
3087596	3089197	Mom probably thought that was worse.
3089237	3089437	What?
3089677	3090437	You were at Rocky?
3090457	3091077	You were at Rocky?
3091097	3091718	Why did you do that?
3096553	3107003	Well, years ago, years upon years ago, I used to have a public access show, which actually kind of leads back to the week and day stuff, because we were so bored.
3107043	3108404	What was this, last night or Friday night?
3108464	3109265	It must have been Friday night.
3109305	3119575	We were so bored, and I was in one of those moods where I actually dug up a copy of my old public access show, and I put it on, and I let my friends watch it that were here.
3120014	3120874	That was hilarious.
3120934	3121875	That would have been awesome.
3121955	3122815	I'm sorry I missed that.
3123055	3123915	Oh, my God.
3124315	3126636	What was I letting myself be subjected to with that?
3126696	3127036	I don't know.
3127096	3128497	Loki actually caught some of it.
3128877	3129337	Any thoughts?
3130337	3132198	It was strange.
3133818	3145342	So, you know, I used to, because it used to be on public access in this area, so, you know, when I'd be out at the mall, people would kind of be looking at me like, isn't that that gay guy from TV?
3145362	3145442	Yeah.
3146687	3152108	They're like, I don't want to admit that I watch it, but I want to approach it.
3152208	3153609	That's what you do as they're approaching.
3153629	3154709	They're like, didn't I see you on TV?
3154729	3156449	And you just start pointing at them, just laughing.
3157370	3158770	What, you watch that?
3158850	3159890	You got a problem?
3159910	3161471	You need to go do something.
3161491	3163451	They don't want to admit they watch public access.
3163571	3166392	Well, of course, they don't want to, you know, boomerangs back around.
3166452	3169253	And a show that I was a part of, nonetheless, on public access.
3169613	3171493	See, you're missing, don't implicate yourself.
3173294	3174214	Sorry, my twin.
3174767	3175468	I'd like to think that.
3201980	3202520	Thanks for watching!
3218067	3225553	We had the songpacks be made available in Canada, and I believe it's seven bucks, Canadian, that they want for the songpacks, which are five songs.
3225853	3228175	But this is huge news for those folks that live in Canada.
3228235	3235700	And if you live in Canada and you weren't aware of this, well, you know now, you can actually download all the songpacks, one through, what, eight now.
3236220	3237982	I think you can at least get one through seven.
3238002	3240183	I'm pretty sure you can get eight at this point now.
3240784	3240924	So...
3242361	3246783	Anyway, definitely check that out if you're in Canada and you've been wanting to get those.
3247383	3248184	It's definitely worth it.
3249304	3256587	But for us here in America, we've just been waiting and waiting and waiting for Song Pack 8 to come out.
3256607	3261669	Because it has some new songs that are new to DDR and haven't been in DDR before.
3261730	3266472	Such as Cosmic Cowgirl, that song from DDR Freak... Guitar Freaks.
3266752	3268352	Guitar Freaks, not DDR Freak.
3268372	3269073	That's a different thing.
3269853	3271814	Which is a whole ton of fun to play on Drum Mania.
3272150	3272630	Yes, it is.
3272950	3275091	And you know what's funny about the steps to Cosmic Cowgirl?
3275371	3280452	It's very similar to kind of how you play it on basic on the guitar, so I thought that was kind of funny.
3281172	3281392	Yeah.
3281892	3284392	And then, let's see, what else is there?
3286873	3289173	By LaLakia, Carried With The Wind was another one.
3289694	3289954	Cool.
3290134	3290294	Yep.
3290534	3296515	And then we have, that's also from Guitar Freaks, and it's kind of a very pop-ish sort of song, like one of those lute songs.
3297225	3302552	and then also Kind Lady Interlude, which is cool, because Kind Lady is cool.
3303093	3307879	And then we have More Deep, which is coming over from Max USA too, or whatever.
3308580	3310343	And then we have another brand new one,
3312085	3319028	And it's a remix of In My Eyes, and it's done by the folks in the band Neuropa, who did the song Standing Still in Time for Ultramix 2.
3320169	3324771	And so what we're going to do, we're going to go ahead and play that for you guys, because we know not all you guys have an Xbox out there.
3325131	3326612	So you probably want to check out this song.
3326652	3327953	Maybe you're thinking about buying the pack.
3328693	3330494	Here it is, a remix of In My Eyes.
3330634	3334136	It's the Neuropa mix, premiere here on Orange Lounge Radio.
3334176	3334396	Enjoy.
3377944	3378609	and many more.
3449457	3453360	Alright, that was a premiere here of In My Eyes, the Naropa mix.
3453621	3455642	That being said, what did y'all think?
3456063	3458024	DarkSakura, I know you have an opinion.
3461627	3464870	It starts with an A, and it ends with an S, and it spells ass!
3466291	3475199	It's another one of those... I've made this argument before where they try too hard to put too much in it, and do too many things at once.
3475940	3476080	No.
3476100	3476140	No.
3476747	3482371	The only ever good mix that I've heard that was not the original was the Midi Head one.
3482591	3483171	Yeah, I agree.
3483191	3484012	The Midi Head one is superior.
3484032	3486474	Which was also good because there wasn't any man singing.
3487735	3490717	Loki, what did you think of that one?
3492438	3493619	Eh, it's okay.
3493639	3494639	I don't know.
3495960	3500343	It's just... I don't know.
3500503	3503045	I have the same opinions on the I Feel remixes.
3503125	3503986	They're just like, eh.
3505106	3505907	Kind of lame.
3506897	3510079	Dan, I know you don't really play much DDR, but did you have an opinion on that song at all?
3510880	3514222	It sounded like four other crappy songs sort of jammed together.
3514703	3515103	You know what?
3515143	3518105	That's exactly my opinion on it, is that I think it's too much.
3518505	3519526	There's too many things going on there.
3519546	3527712	It's like I would recognize part of it, well, I guess it wasn't mixed, but I'd recognize part of it from something that I totally didn't expect it to be from, and I'd be thinking, hey, I like that, but I don't like it here.
3528673	3528993	And it's awful.
3529494	3535503	And I feel bad because I really like Naropa and I really, really, really like their other song and Ultramix too.
3535843	3540870	I think it's awesome, but I just don't know where that mix came from, honestly.
3540890	3543774	Hey, we knew in the chatroom we just took a shot at the Sega Master System.
3543834	3544175	Sucks.
3546448	3549690	Back on track, back on track.
3549890	3553131	Hold on, we can hate on people who hate Sega later.
3554772	3559375	But the remix itself is just, it's so busy and there's so much going on.
3559435	3560195	I just, I don't know.
3560335	3562156	The MIDI head one I thought was way better.
3562676	3564997	That one, I hate to say it, I don't really care for it.
3565037	3571241	But the weird thing about it is, is that when you actually play it in the game, the steps I actually like a whole lot.
3571961	3573722	Which is kind of weird because...
3575484	3581925	The steps are kind of odd, and they don't really go with the beat at all, but I think that's the reason why I like it so much, is because it's very different.
3582265	3598269	Like, they're different, and you'd think there's only so many different patterns you could do with four arrows, and everything you can do, everything that can be done has been done, but I think that the steps to the song when I played it, it was the first song I played in a long, long time where I went, huh, these steps are kind of unique.
3598469	3598889	I like it.
3599409	3610858	So, for that reason, it kind of made it a fun one to dance to, but the song itself, it's like, could I take those steps and put them on a different song, and I'd be much happier, because that song doesn't really do it for me.
3611618	3613280	I can't really see getting down to that, so.
3614661	3616202	Well, maybe you guys have a different thought.
3616262	3619064	We will open up the Skype line later if you guys have a thought on that one.
3619104	3621046	You can definitely share your opinion there with us.
3621566	3622006	www.
3624119	3653043	dot orange launch radio dot com click on interact with us and you can learn all sorts of detail about the skype line alright speaking of the skype line we're going to go to the skype line pretty quick and we're going to talk to one of our buddies on the skype line who sent us some news this week on Gita Dora the brand new incarnation of Gita Dora it's going to be a little different so let's see if we can get him on the skype line I just sent him a message that says we're calling so hopefully he's there
3654941	3657203	And hopefully we don't have lag issues or any of that stuff going on.
3657883	3658683	So we'll find out.
3661305	3669969	And we're going to talk about Guitar Freaks and Drum Mania V. Like the song, V. Like peace.
3670810	3671870	And now it doesn't want to call.
3671950	3672590	That's very odd.
3673691	3675572	It's just saying connecting, dot dot dot, connecting.
3676552	3678113	Oh no, and it says user not online.
3678133	3678574	What happened?
3678614	3679334	What happened?
3682708	3683228	All right, fine.
3683248	3684589	What we'll do is we'll go here.
3684669	3689290	We're going to go to the list.
3691611	3700673	I'm actually very excited to be seeing at least some type of new incarnation of Guitar Freaks and Drum Mania because it seems like that series was getting very stale.
3700953	3702874	It was kind of like, oh, here comes 9th mix.
3703134	3704314	Oh, here comes 10th mix.
3704634	3705655	Oh, here comes 11th mix.
3705735	3706955	It's just the same thing over and over.
3707415	3710116	But now it sounds like that there's actually something new
3714450	3719538	Skyplane isn't open for general calls just yet, but we'll be taking those calls a little bit later.
3719638	3720880	So don't get too impatient.
3720900	3722302	We will get those calls a little later.
3723784	3724746	But first I want to talk about this.
3729099	3737504	So what's going on right now with this is... I guess it's location testing right now, or something weird's going on right now.
3737924	3739665	But we have a little bit of a song list.
3739725	3741386	We have some song lists going on right now.
3741826	3743567	And we're going to post this a little later.
3744228	3745448	A Romanized song list.
3745468	3747309	Thank you very much to DarkLionXVI.
3747329	3753873	They gave us a Romanized song list of Guitar Freaks and Drum Mania V. And we're going to post that on our website a little later, the Romanized list.
3754769	3755449	But let's see.
3755589	3758030	Let me point out some highlights through the list here.
3758670	3761491	A brand new Thomas Howard Lichtenstein song, You'll Be a Man.
3762231	3762851	That's what they call it.
3763171	3764592	There's a band called Pooh.
3765892	3767372	And they have a song called Mushroom Boy.
3768073	3768893	Best name ever.
3769073	3772454	Desro featuring Shige with Endless Cruising.
3773174	3775354	And Brad Holmes, After a Hard Day.
3776335	3777975	And then we have some licensed songs.
3777995	3780436	They're actually covers by various folks.
3780996	3781456	But we have...
3782085	3792091	Sakunabo by Otsuka Ai, and then we have Friends by Rebecca, NGS by Asian Kung Fu Generation, Nocturne No.
3792112	3805120	9 by Hotei Tomoyasu, Wild Challenger by Jindu, and this is the best right here in my opinion, Misery Lou by the Spaghetti Surfers.
3805140	3806020	You remember Misery Lou?
3806080	3807782	Misery Lou is the song from Pulp Fiction.
3808182	3811204	Duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh.
3812386	3813127	That song was awesome.
3815249	3821415	And then there's going to be some licensed songs as performed by the original musician that go on in this as well.
3823397	3826480	And let's see, we're going to try getting our buddy back on the line here again.
3830805	3832366	I'm going to tell him to call us, hopefully.
3832867	3833868	Something weird's going on there.
3839814	3843397	And we have some licensed songs that's being performed by the original artists.
3843758	3848582	And what I thought was interesting about this is that there's a Vanilla Ninja song in there.
3848962	3852646	And you know Vanilla Ninja was a girl group that did Tough Enough in Ultra Mix 2?
3853126	3859852	Vanilla Ninja is on the list, and they are doing the song Liar, which I think is very interesting.
3859952	3860673	Oh, there's our buddy.
3862334	3862735	Hi!
3863308	3863668	Siggy?
3863989	3865169	Hey guys, Siggy here.
3865230	3866851	Finally, we got you on the line.
3867431	3868952	I don't know what the heck happened.
3869032	3870374	Skype's acting funny tonight.
3870414	3871314	I don't know what's going on.
3871614	3878600	Okay, so we've been talking a little bit about Guitar Freaks, Drug Mania, V. We were talking about the original songs, the licensed cover songs.
3878640	3886266	I was just getting into the licensed songs performed by the original artists, and I was kind of going, Vanilla Ninja, WTF!
3886706	3889989	They're the girly band from Ultramix 2.
3890329	3891450	What the hell are they doing here?
3892611	3893171	Any thoughts?
3894172	3894572	I don't know.
3894652	3896132	I've never heard of Vanilla Ninja.
3896212	3899813	Vanilla Ninja is the group that did Tough Enough in Ultramix 2.
3899913	3901094	And it's also in the groove.
3901174	3903395	I'm not into DDR Ultramix and stuff.
3903475	3905635	Well, do you do the in the groove thing at all?
3906376	3907516	Oh, I never, never.
3907696	3908736	I never go for in the groove.
3908977	3909257	All right.
3909297	3909937	Well, that's fine.
3909957	3910477	Not my thing.
3912018	3914738	Well, I'd play a little clip, but I just don't feel like it right now.
3915139	3922061	Tell me about some of the other stuff we can expect with Guitar Freaks and Drum Mania V. Stuff that you've heard about.
3922081	3922221	Well, uh...
3923348	3935934	Not really much to expect, but on the official website of Gita Dora V right now, the Gita Dora team is apologizing because they did not include the hidden option.
3937514	3938015	Weird.
3938355	3939155	The hidden option.
3940116	3944798	Isn't this game location testing right now, or did it actually... They're actually playing right now.
3945078	3945498	Oh, wow.
3946438	3946819	Interesting.
3947379	3949900	Yeah, the official website of Gita Dora V is open.
3951027	3954488	But sometimes those websites just go up when they're location testing.
3954528	3956029	Is this game actually out and about now?
3956969	3961131	There wasn't anything said about the location test, so that means they're already playing.
3961471	3961972	Oh, wow.
3962452	3962712	Yeah.
3962952	3963472	I'll be damned.
3965753	3966033	All right.
3966393	3972436	So you wanted to introduce a little song here, something that we can actually expect to hear in Guitar Freaks Drum Media V, yes?
3973016	3976197	It is the exact licensed song performed by the original artist.
3977098	3977658	Very cool.
3978198	3980219	So Bimani Metalheads, Rejoice.
3980922	3981423	We won't be sad
4010116	4015561	We had none, we had none, we had none, we had none We had none, we had none, we had none
4043924	4050851	We've come to an understanding You are a prophet While I'm new to the race of secrets No more excuses
4076781	4082145	And all the time we try to tear the street down
4142995	4148218	Certainly a diverse reaction to that song in the chat room.
4148418	4151600	And hold on a minute because my head's still ringing a little bit there.
4152321	4152561	Wow.
4153939	4154560	Metalhead Haters
4176443	4189893	You know what, okay, I guess the metalhead folks, because some folks in the chatroom are just cheering at this, and some people are just absolutely saying, I don't even want to play Guitar Freaks Drum Mania V right now if this song's on it.
4191615	4199781	But some folks are just saying this is awesome, so certainly a diverse selection of music to be in the next Guitar Freaks Drum Mania incarnation.
4200602	4201983	I'd totally play that song.
4202083	4203003	That's just great.
4203444	4205065	Except my hand would hurt like a bitch.
4205444	4206545	But I'd play that song.
4206945	4207826	I would play that song.
4208146	4212009	You get the wailing bonus for, like, whacking the guitar against the machine when you're done?
4212109	4217914	That's the kind of song where I would wail and then swing the guitar around and smack a Roseville, Golfland child in the face.
4219515	4220416	In front of his mother.
4220436	4226881	I don't have any tokens for you, you little shit!
4226961	4231185	Can you imagine the drum mania part of that song?
4232865	4235366	That's not going to be an easy song, whatever that is.
4235406	4238907	That's very interesting.
4242428	4246769	Some folks in the chat room are saying, here are the lyrics to that song, and then just banging on the keyboard.
4247049	4248429	Because you really can't understand.
4248789	4250150	Let me take a little clip.
4250730	4253110	Siggy, help me understand here, because you seem to be in the middle.
4253371	4254951	Help me understand what they're saying in this song.
4256912	4258192	Let me get you to the part where they're actually singing.
4265195	4271317	Sounds like Lords of Dishwasher Scabies is what I heard.
4272518	4278380	Honestly, I haven't checked out the lyrics to Panasonic Youth yet.
4278540	4280180	This is a thrash metal.
4283001	4284962	So, yeah, it's kind of really hard to understand.
4285103	4286864	It certainly does make me want to break things.
4289066	4289426	Seriously.
4291808	4297172	All right, well, it's certainly a sign of diversity to come in the next Guitar Freaks.
4297512	4299713	Any other news on this new mix you want to share with us?
4299754	4303456	Well, let me just help you out pronouncing the songs right.
4303636	4305818	Please do, because I have issues, apparently.
4308180	4310862	The Carried by the Wind song, it's actually pronounced Balalaika.
4310922	4312283	Ah, okay.
4313621	4315502	Ancient Breeze by Ono Hideyuki and White Tornado by Trek Trap
4331710	4332491	Yeah, you get to pick.
4332611	4335233	Because usually, like in the older Guitar Freaks, you don't get to pick.
4335273	4339857	But I noticed, I think in the newer one, like some of the newer ones, you get to start picking a little later on.
4340217	4341699	I just remember, what was it?
4342019	4349685	Fifth note was fourth mix with Carnival Day.
4351267	4353188	And going, what the hell song is this?
4353208	4355110	Because it kicked my ass the first time around.
4355470	4356671	I remember Fireball.
4357211	4357951	Fireball.
4357991	4359071	From like 6 and 5.
4359912	4361732	But now I can beat Carnival Day easy.
4362913	4364674	All the songs now are a lot harder than they used to be.
4366354	4375498	Yeah, on the Gita Dora V, there are two special stages, which is Encore, Fairy Tales by Izumi Mitsushiko, and the Premium Encore stage.
4375538	4376558	Here's a little bit interesting.
4376838	4378979	The Zabu Fluta by Wanyan Panic.
4379199	4382341	Now, the song The Zabu Fluta is a Mozart song.
4383121	4383361	Hmm.
4385134	4390159	But I'm sure they've made it very difficult to play and rock out because it's a premium encore.
4390319	4393622	Any idea what the differences are between an encore and a premium encore at this point?
4394143	4397386	Well, it's kind of like Guitadora 10-9.
4399869	4408217	Like, you know, if you have a double ass on an extra stage, you get to access premium encore stage, which was a timepiece phase 2.
4408918	4409198	Right.
4410327	4410647	Okay.
4411228	4421698	If you don't get, you know, if you don't get an, if you got an S, you get to access Unscore Stage, which is, you know, which is a Model DD5 on a Guita Dora 9.
4421798	4422619	It's kind of like that.
4423119	4424300	Okay, okay, that makes sense.
4424580	4425041	Sounds cool.
4425121	4426082	Loki, you had a comment?
4426102	4427924	You wanted to say something?
4427944	4428164	No.
4428644	4429125	Oh, I thought you did.
4429165	4430546	You were like reaching for the mic, I thought.
4430566	4431167	Fine.
4431207	4431447	Fine.
4432840	4438645	Any other comments you want to tell us about Guitadora V until we start seeing some machines here in the States and we start getting some news around here?
4438705	4439866	There are revival songs.
4439946	4444790	I'm not sure whether it's going to be an e-amusement access or not.
4445030	4448153	But here are the songs that are going to be revived.
4448193	4453958	Model DD2, Herring Row, Staff, Smile For You, High...
4454764	4459986	Sweet Illusion, Potpourri d'Orange, Heaven Inside, and Depend on Me Long Version.
4460126	4463087	Come on, everybody knows that song is Potpourri d'Orange.
4463187	4463567	Come on.
4464208	4465268	Potpourri d'Orange.
4466668	4467529	It's Paul Sanderson.
4470050	4471250	But I hate the French.
4471810	4472631	I'm kidding, I'm kidding.
4472851	4473531	Oh, merde.
4475292	4477392	Everybody knows that song is Potpourri d'Orange.
4477432	4478933	Don't give me that d'orange stuff.
4479580	4480340	It's Da Orange.
4480880	4483021	It's much better when it's pronounced in French, Monsieur.
4483041	4485502	Just like you're listening to Da Orange Lounge Radio, alright?
4485542	4486202	It's Da Orange.
4486342	4488683	It's not Da Orange Lounge Radio.
4488763	4495785	And yeah, and the other Orange Lounge song is pronounced Putori de Marmalade.
4496845	4499826	Okay, well now I've heard Marmalade, but that's only because I know this song.
4500206	4502587	Criole de Marmalade.
4507618	4512201	Alright, Siggy, thanks for the updates on Guitadora V. We appreciate it.
4512281	4514603	Even if that song gave us all a headache, we do appreciate it.
4515524	4516364	Alright, have a good one, buddy.
4516384	4517325	Alright, later.
4517465	4517745	Later.
4519667	4520727	Always helping us out there.
4521128	4524650	Helping me out with my pronunciation because I have issues pronouncing things.
4524790	4525671	Because I've given up.
4529628	4530048	You know what?
4530308	4537991	At some point, we're going to roll you over here to this screen so you can see this list and you're going to start reading all this stuff so they can make fun of me.
4538451	4538691	Okay.
4538911	4540611	Or they can make fun of you instead of me.
4541171	4541431	Loki.
4542112	4542832	I found the lyrics.
4543332	4544532	You found the lyrics.
4545933	4548713	Okay, these are the lyrics to that song, Panasonic.
4548733	4551294	I'm going to give you a little taste of the lyrics.
4552715	4553855	Should I do it in their style?
4555792	4557393	The idea is we want to know what they are.
4557853	4558313	Okay, sorry.
4558734	4565897	We wrote these plans, took the order, the architecture, and followed them to the end until the gears ground cold and relentless.
4566377	4567458	There was no remorse.
4567578	4568238	We had none.
4568298	4570319	We kept on with no trace of a regret.
4570860	4573381	I never saw any blood, no soul for the body.
4573461	4575722	Watched them turn, her scab-covered skin.
4575942	4579164	Hey, that's the part that I thought was dishwasher scabies, because of the skin.
4579904	4594111	Her scab-covered skin into a stone like a coal in the sky Searching for the dawn for the last time Bloated with wide eyes wide We've come to an understanding You lose, I profit, high noon And there ain't no secrets no more The song is called what?
4594131	4595712	Well, I'm not going to read the whole damn song.
4596092	4597192	And it's one giant run-on.
4598533	4602155	Yeah, the whole thing is one giant run-on sentence, which is not much of a surprise.
4602635	4603716	What's the song called again?
4604256	4605817	It's called Panasonic Youth.
4606197	4608438	I thought it was going to be about, like, VCRs and...
4614158	4619540	When I first read it, I only heard, I don't know, somehow my eyes only caught the Sonic Youth part.
4619900	4623001	And I was like, cool, we're getting a Sonic Youth song in Guitar Freaks.
4624282	4625622	And then I was disappointed.
4626983	4628043	Especially once you heard it.
4629136	4632119	There is a Sonic Youth song that I would want in Guitar Freaks.
4633080	4633461	And that's 100%.
4633921	4636384	I want way more songs in Guitar Freaks.
4636464	4637405	And more home versions.
4637985	4640408	We definitely need more home versions.
4640668	4641128	Amen.
4641269	4643491	I need to put my Drum Mania controller to use.
4644172	4646634	Dude, I've been session moding it all the time.
4646654	4647775	You just won't come down and play.
4648176	4648416	All right.
4649826	4653247	If you can hear the breathing in the background, that's because we did pick up the Skype line.
4653547	4656508	Even though I didn't say it was open, eh, hell, people were calling in anyway.
4656848	4658088	Ah, hell, let's take a call.
4659028	4660128	You're on Orange Lounge Radio.
4660148	4660508	Who dis?
4661408	4662529	This is El Mullet.
4662909	4663829	Hello, El Mullet.
4663849	4664409	How you doing?
4664949	4665969	I'm doing good, Skye.
4666009	4666789	How about yourself?
4667370	4668050	I'm okay.
4668090	4672511	I'm trying to get over the Dishwater Scabies song, but otherwise I'm doing okay.
4673831	4674431	What's on your mind?
4675495	4678856	Well, I have recently taken the plunge into 2DX.
4679476	4680916	Congratulations!
4681616	4684497	How does one take the plunge, so to speak, into 2DX?
4685277	4688638	Well, you spend $250 on games in the controller.
4688698	4689618	That's quite a plunge.
4690938	4691338	Been there.
4691498	4692699	Been there, done that, yes.
4693079	4695639	And so how are you enjoying the water now that you've taken the plunge?
4696780	4698420	I am enjoying the water very much.
4699178	4699719	Thanks for watching!
4706916	4708617	Well, how is it going for you?
4708677	4711879	I mean, how are you warming up into the game?
4711919	4716843	Did you jump right into hard stuff, or did you just start on beginner mode or drill mode?
4716883	4718084	How are you getting into this game?
4718104	4727892	Well, I wanted to start on Light 7, but I was forced into beginner mode because, well, two stars on Light 7 kicked my ass, and that couldn't have been right.
4729713	4730234	It's tough.
4730294	4730914	It's a tough game.
4731174	4733216	Have you ever played the arcade version at all?
4734125	4736907	Actually, I have a total of two times.
4737668	4743532	Once in 2003 when I went to Vegas, and once in 2004 when the machine in Vegas moved to a different place.
4744092	4746934	So you at least had some idea of what to expect?
4747935	4748455	Pretty much.
4748555	4755981	I mean, I had more experience in the original Beatmania, actually.
4756381	4757562	I played it a few more times.
4758894	4760095	Okay, right on.
4762076	4769139	Now, usually there's that big question that always goes around out there is that, you know, I'm new to 2DX, what style should I buy?
4769739	4771060	So what styles did you end up buying?
4771640	4775302	I ended up getting 7th and 8th style being as they are the most current ones.
4777784	4784367	So far I like 7th style the best because it has the more fleshed out beginner's mode and it has more of the songs that I like.
4785842	4789066	Interesting, because I kind of preferred 8th style when I played them both.
4789086	4790968	Yeah, it's kind of interesting, but okay, alright.
4791208	4793150	Well, of course, but we have a different perspective.
4793170	4794552	You know, we're not new anymore.
4794572	4797755	I spent three hours playing 8th style one night.
4798215	4798736	That's pretty hot.
4798756	4799437	On New Year's Eve.
4799657	4800798	Which one has burning heat?
4802060	4802140	7th.
4803601	4803922	7th, yes.
4804422	4805644	Then 7th style rocks.
4807921	4813582	It's not that I don't like 8th style, it's that 7th style is much better for me to get into.
4813602	4815362	I can play more songs on beginner.
4816883	4820163	It's much easier for me to go through.
4820203	4825564	Then I go to 8th style, play a few songs, and go back to 7th style and cower in the corner of beginner's mode again.
4827344	4827944	There you go.
4828444	4832605	So, is your goal to become a 2DX master?
4832625	4837326	Are you going to pick up the other styles at some point, or do you think this is going to be it for you, or what
4839243	4848111	I'm looking into purchasing Ninth Style eventually when it comes out, but I'm leaning toward waiting for it rather than pre-ordering for it.
4848311	4854397	I'd rather get good on the two games that I have before jumping into a third one and spreading myself even further.
4855390	4855931	NightStyleSongList
4875532	4877814	And that's the one thing that's holding me back from playing a lot of 2DX.
4877835	4884982	That's what I don't get is why my controller, which is a good two years older than yours, is still in perfect condition.
4885102	4888225	Mine took a lot of abuse, especially when... Mine fell off of the van.
4889467	4890107	Then I don't know.
4890408	4892009	I really don't know what to tell you on that one.
4892049	4894652	I'd like to tell that story, but we don't have that kind of time.
4895273	4896794	Actually, we do have quite a bit of time.
4897739	4900340	Told her, don't take the fucking controller.
4900461	4901561	You're not going to use it.
4901601	4902782	We're going to a convention.
4902802	4903962	We're going to have other things to do.
4903982	4904483	I used it.
4904563	4905343	She's like, no, no, no, no, no.
4905363	4905883	I got to take it.
4905923	4906604	It's brand new.
4906744	4907965	I mean, we just got it.
4908045	4908725	Beautiful shape.
4909125	4910666	I said, no, it's going to get abused.
4910706	4912027	You're going to throw it in the back of the van.
4912047	4912887	Something's going to happen.
4913327	4913968	We get there.
4914068	4915028	We pull in the parking garage.
4915088	4916609	We pop open the back of the van.
4916909	4919371	The controller doesn't just fall out.
4919671	4921832	It like gets propelled out.
4922312	4925634	Flies across the parking garage and just clatters in the pavement.
4926704	4931026	Jamie's got a look on her face like... And I'm like, see?
4931046	4933527	I fucking told you that was going to happen.
4933607	4935788	And that's probably the sound she made, too, huh?
4935848	4936288	Exactly.
4936308	4937688	I mean, she looked shocked.
4937708	4938869	And that thing had been broken.
4938989	4941170	I would have never, ever let her forget it.
4941210	4942310	But she got off lucky.
4942950	4944251	And it worked just fine.
4944831	4946712	And we took it apart and gave it a little service.
4946832	4949773	We didn't take it apart that day.
4949813	4951293	No, we took it all apart.
4951394	4952534	We cleaned every button.
4953044	4954424	and it works a lot better now.
4954504	4955385	We did that recently.
4955585	4957265	No, no, we didn't do it that day.
4957665	4961346	We didn't do any of that bizarre shaving the buttons like some idiots that we know advise us to do.
4961366	4962987	Which I refuse to.
4963127	4964127	I didn't shave the buttons.
4964367	4968328	That's because you're smart.
4968368	4971109	You should have the mad scientist here build you a real controller.
4971149	4973610	Take the circuit board out of that old controller.
4973630	4974830	Because he'll never finish it.
4974870	4976770	He doesn't finish any of his projects.
4977090	4979691	The only one he's ever finished is the orange Xbox thing.
4980931	4982752	Now, now, I finished those pads
4983160	4983480	Hey, look.
4983500	4984281	The pads are done.
4984601	4985982	And they broke after like a week.
4986162	4987063	They did not break.
4987103	4988504	They work perfectly fine.
4988524	4990706	It's just they build up a lot of static electricity.
4991306	4994769	The trick is to get it done cosmetically before you get it done functionally.
4995649	4997471	Because it's like your arcade cap.
4997571	4998531	The thing works.
4999252	5001754	So it's like, damn, why should I work on it more?
5001794	5002294	It works.
5002314	5003795	It doesn't look so great.
5004776	5005016	All right.
5005276	5009059	We've got our caller online, our poor caller sitting there just listening to us yell at each other.
5009539	5009900	Hi.
5010660	5010920	Hi.
5010980	5011561	How you doing?
5011581	5011661	Good.
5012961	5019926	I will get to that 7th style break at some point because I know you wanted to hear some 7th style music to celebrate your 2DX goodness.
5022288	5027572	Anything that you think the home versions are lacking versus the arcade version, having played both?
5029094	5034438	I've had such little experience with the arcade version, I wouldn't know what to say, what to do.
5034458	5041183	I can't really comment on arcade song list versus home song list because these are the only songs that I know
5042975	5044055	So politically correct.
5047438	5054603	I guess if I could say that my controller is a little unresponsive in some portions.
5055143	5059006	The turntable right now is the bane of my existence.
5059066	5062388	I'm so tempted to turn on auto-scratch, but then I don't learn anything.
5063128	5065330	Out of curiosity, what kind of controller did you pick up?
5065350	5066751	Did you pick up an official Konami one?
5067429	5068069	Yes, I did.
5068149	5070090	The official Konami one.
5070330	5070790	Good for you.
5070830	5071691	Those are the ones you want to get.
5072431	5072831	Good job.
5074051	5077133	Well, and just take very, very good care of it.
5077213	5081414	Like, seriously, the next one I get, I'm going to put it back in the box every time I play.
5081454	5091238	I'm going to, like, wrap it back up so that a damn piece of dust does not get into that thing because I don't know how my current controller got ruined, but it's just screwed beyond belief and it makes me sad.
5092631	5094252	Anything else you want to share with us today, O'Mullet?
5095813	5097114	That's pretty much it.
5097214	5102638	I'm in 2DX and I'm not off the DDR bandwagon yet.
5103158	5104099	Alright, sounds good.
5104699	5112065	You know, a lot of people when they go over to 2DX, they start adopting that DDR sucks attitude.
5113185	5118949	Believe it or not, I can kind of see where they're coming from because 2DX is a hell of a lot more challenging than DDR is.
5120030	5121211	It's a different game.
5122159	5123442	It's a different game.
5123582	5124163	Yes, it is.
5124264	5126007	Comparing apples to oranges.
5134482	5137503	With DDR, you're moving your whole body.
5137963	5140104	With 2DX, you're moving your fingers.
5140524	5147507	Now, granted, it may take longer to get better at this or whatever, but it's certainly a different type of challenge.
5147847	5157610	Definitely, one of them is challenging your physical ability, while one of them is challenging a little more your musical and rhythmic ability.
5158071	5159351	So, it's very different.
5159949	5160369	That's true.
5160389	5160930	That's true.
5177600	5179020	and it was fantastic.
5179281	5180841	It can't be that much harder.
5180861	5181761	You see like these, what?
5182181	5182902	What's the biggest song?
5182942	5184622	Is it like a 10-foot these days?
5184782	5186122	Oh, on DDR?
5186262	5186803	Yeah, 10-foot.
5186823	5189563	You could go over to... It's called like Nuclear-tastic or something?
5189583	5193765	You could go over to In The Groove and they have like 13s, Pandemonium or something like that.
5193785	5194905	It's like a super tough song.
5194925	5198626	I remember watching these people play like, you know, like the 8-foot songs, like in the day.
5198766	5202927	And I'm watching these songs, like, I don't know, what was the one, Dropout or something like that?
5203267	5205648	And I'm watching you guys play this and I'm like, oh dear God!
5206745	5207666	What the hell?
5208026	5209607	You can't move that fast.
5209827	5216811	The person that does the 2DX one-handed would go over to DDR and probably... After playing a song.
5217112	5223195	And the person that plays DDR and plays the 14-footers or whatever would probably go over to 2DX and go, Too many lines!
5223416	5224136	Too many lines!
5224736	5226938	That's pretty much how I went into it.
5227665	5228706	Looks can be deceiving, my friend.
5252778	5253919	It's the cartoon bunnies.
5253939	5254819	That's where they get you.
5254939	5256540	It is all about keyboard mania.
5256640	5257780	God bless keyboard mania.
5257840	5258820	Rest your soul in peace.
5258940	5259481	I miss ye.
5261361	5262222	Did they kill it?
5262522	5263942	Yeah, well, pretty much.
5264002	5266823	I mean, it's on indefinite hiatus, basically.
5267444	5268184	That means it's dead.
5268284	5269164	Yeah, basically.
5271425	5275026	All right, we're going to let you go because I've got other people that are hammering the lines that want to get in.
5275166	5276547	Oh, yes, please, work in your plug.
5277688	5280670	InsidePulse.com My column's on Fridays.
5280850	5281911	Read it, please.
5282331	5282991	It pays the bills.
5283031	5284552	No, I don't get paid shit for this.
5285173	5286954	Are you going to get to go to E3 because of it?
5286974	5288094	Because you have a column on the intro?
5288114	5289375	I have final exams.
5289475	5291476	You poor bastard!
5292477	5295399	They always organize final exams when E3 is.
5295419	5296579	I hate my college.
5296639	5298781	I hate it to death.
5298841	5299881	How many more years is college?
5301282	5303784	At the end of this year, I should be out, finally.
5303884	5304844	Then we'll see you next year.
5305185	5306385	Alright, have a good one, buddy.
5307970	5308190	Later.
5308330	5308571	Later.
5329574	5338037	Well, my computer was down for a couple of weeks, and then my anime cosplay club, we were getting ready for Capcom, and we were taking Sundays for rehearsals.
5339337	5339838	Okay, okay.
5339878	5340918	So we got that together, yeah.
5341078	5346200	Yeah, people like to use Sunday nights for other things, even though they should understand that this program is on.
5346260	5347540	I mean, hello.
5347560	5348621	They should all be in church.
5350221	5351021	Worshipping us.
5351902	5352202	Just kidding.
5352222	5353542	Well, this is my church right here.
5353722	5354563	This is my church.
5354763	5355963	Church of Orange Lines Radio.
5356163	5356763	Amen!
5357144	5357584	Amen!
5358857	5359878	Can I get an amen?
5360058	5361399	Testify, my brother.
5363700	5365061	God, that's a scary notion.
5365922	5367563	That is a scary-ass notion.
5367803	5368564	Don't praise us.
5368924	5369224	Don't.
5369345	5370405	You being the head of a church?
5370445	5373608	We're just big, stupid kids like the rest of you.
5373668	5379572	Rob, you can't deny the financial opportunities in being the head of a church.
5380512	5384175	Plus, when you get tired of it being a church, it can become a cult.
5384235	5385776	And then you can be a cult leader.
5385856	5390559	Okay, I'd be one of those churches that would be like on the Daily Show because we have the topless preachers.
5390679	5394482	I mean, that would be... What church is this?
5395743	5397064	That's what I'm talking about.
5398062	5400823	Well, if you guys were a church, it'd be a tax write-off.
5401223	5402423	Oh my God, he's got a point.
5403723	5406564	If we were a church, we could write this shit off on our taxes.
5406584	5407564	That's what I was telling you.
5407584	5409864	You can't deny the financial opportunity.
5409924	5410925	Can I get an amen?
5411685	5416966	There's a guy I met at Coast Con eight years ago who has the Church of the Great Green Frog.
5418026	5420387	He did it just so he could have the tax write-off.
5420627	5423407	And he was going around passing Get Out of Hell free cards.
5425168	5427348	There is a first church of Pac-Man as well.
5428070	5430231	There's also the Partridge Family Cult.
5431672	5434033	I kid you not, the Partridge Family Cult exists.
5434073	5434633	That's hot.
5436714	5444898	It fully looked like the Monopoly card, except it had a frog with wings, wearing a tuxedo, and it was the Church of the Great Green Frog.
5446018	5447499	I'm going to see if he has a website.
5449120	5452762	Anyway, before we got off on that tangent, how was the convention that you went to?
5453722	5454623	It was really good.
5455023	5457704	Some people complained it was in two different hotels, but
5458191	5459491	I had a great time overall.
5459751	5463412	It was packed as hell and it was tons of Naruto cosplayers.
5463692	5464712	Gee, I wonder why.
5465292	5467533	Could it be because it was NarutoCon?
5468553	5470794	That and it was licensed just that week.
5471674	5472594	Oh, yeah, that's right.
5472894	5473494	I heard that news.
5473534	5474114	Very cool.
5475094	5477875	Yeah, we got together for the giant photo shoot.
5477895	5479435	There was about 200 of us.
5479815	5481296	We're all in front of the hotel.
5481696	5484976	People that want to take our pictures are going into the streets.
5485337	5487517	We're telling people to drive around us.
5488143	5489906	Security's coming out settling us out.
5489926	5490647	You gotta move.
5490687	5491268	You gotta move.
5491548	5492450	There's 200 of us.
5492730	5494513	Where are we going to move to?
5494713	5498118	Were they taking pictures, like, for promotional purposes as well?
5498138	5499140	Like, are you gonna be famous?
5500330	5503531	No, it was a giant Naruto cosplay photo shoot.
5503831	5504171	Oh, okay.
5504231	5505492	Everybody wanted to jump in on it.
5505592	5506452	That's still pretty cool.
5506672	5507092	Very cool.
5507212	5510633	Yeah, I can post links to some pictures if you'd like later.
5510994	5511834	Post them in the chat room.
5511854	5512834	Let our chatters check it out.
5512854	5513314	It'd be cool.
5513574	5514695	That I will in just a bit.
5514855	5516275	All right, sounds good.
5516735	5518276	Any video gaming going on at the convention?
5519456	5521757	I couldn't even make it over to the gaming section.
5521917	5527459	All I know is that if it was the same setup like last year, it was like maybe...
5528106	5532467	There's probably one American Idol set up, two Karaoke Revolution.
5532487	5532927	Wait, wait, wait.
5533007	5534007	American Idol?
5534687	5534947	Yes.
5535248	5536348	At one of these conventions?
5536408	5537388	What the heck?
5537648	5538588	That's not Japanese.
5538668	5539148	What is that?
5539949	5540929	That's crap.
5541989	5544249	After Gwen Stefani's CD, I'm calling.
5544930	5547850	They're going to try to get her to come to a con to sing any of those songs.
5549751	5550191	And I'm done.
5550251	5551291	That's when I'll retire.
5551747	5552127	Wow.
5552507	5553268	Okay, okay.
5553588	5559931	I think you were breaking up a little bit there, but I picked up most of that, I think, about the Gwen Stefani CD and after her latest inspirations and everything.
5560691	5561511	Very interesting.
5561571	5561891	Wow.
5563632	5563932	All right.
5566113	5567574	Anything else you wanted to share with us tonight?
5567594	5568014	What are you calling?
5569255	5570055	The skit that we did.
5571076	5573036	We did Naruto 2 Ninja Rap.
5573116	5575297	We won Best Technical Job.
5575978	5577218	Best Technical Job.
5577498	5581200	What exactly is the technical component of a skit at an anime convention?
5581840	5587763	The fact that the tech group loved the fact that they were able to post GoNinjaGo on the big screens while we were dancing.
5588644	5589404	That's very cool.
5590265	5590605	Yeah.
5591225	5591785	Very cool.
5593266	5594907	Alright, well congratulations on the award.
5594967	5595687	What did you get for that?
5597508	5598929	We just got a trophy, that was it.
5599069	5601130	It seems that cons are getting cheaper and cheaper.
5601150	5606153	I remember when you won, they gave you like a box set and a stack of music and other stuff.
5606213	5607194	Now it's just a certificate.
5607234	5610095	Hey, you got a NarutoCon trophy.
5610195	5611396	Who needs a fucking Oscar, right?
5612571	5612931	True.
5614552	5615553	I have my fandom.
5616234	5616774	There you go.
5617274	5620176	Alright, before I let you go, can I get an amen?
5621317	5621838	Amen!
5621958	5622558	Thank you very much.
5622578	5623039	Have a good one.
5623739	5624099	You too.
5624219	5624540	Later.
5624620	5625040	Laters.
5625260	5625560	Bye.
5626821	5632405	I'd like it to be said that that whole phone call is like why I don't go to anime conventions anymore.
5632926	5633366	Why not?
5634587	5636668	Have you been to an anime convention?
5636848	5637509	Not in a long time.
5637529	5638430	Wait, hold on there, caller.
5639170	5640351	Not in a long time.
5641212	5641692	The skit
5642540	5643241	DarkSakura, DarkSakura.com
5660698	5662340	All this jive about Dillager
5686733	5688095	Liz, waiting for us to shut up.
5688316	5690960	I'm sorry, Zach, I will shut up now so you can talk.
5691040	5692061	What's on your mind?
5693203	5694505	It needs to be the legend of hang-ups.
5695896	5701120	All this jive about Dillinger's skate plan song on Guitar Freaks and Drum Mania.
5701420	5704763	The fact that it was basically shunned upon in this chatroom, no offense.
5705824	5711488	And, you know, I as a metalhead, I mean, what's the deal with the rest of the chatroom?
5711508	5718434	Why is, like, you know, it's almost split, let alone almost, you know, leaning towards hatred towards this song.
5718494	5719855	You know what, Zaku?
5719935	5721496	I sense a bunch of haters about this.
5722588	5723088	But think about it Skye
5746721	5757606	Think about it, I mean, you have a song, you have Konami right here, who's basically has the balls to even license a song in the first place, so that way they could attract a newer, you know, newer type of group.
5757626	5760907	They're being very eclectic with the songs that they have so far.
5761607	5765449	And so, you know, in this, if they were to go stateside with Good Adoram...
5766172	5768193	They'll pick up the metalheads like that if they have that song.
5768433	5770334	Well, here's my thought.
5770394	5777738	If they have the balls to license that song, I mean, as interesting of a selection as it is or whatever, why don't they have the balls to put out a new DDR?
5779378	5780679	Now, let's go ahead and stop right there, okay?
5780699	5785341	Well, that's a different story, but... No self-respecting metalhead will ever play Guitar Freaks.
5785361	5788803	Yeah, that's a different story, but regarding this one... Ever.
5789603	5791744	Now, that's a pretty controversial point, Dan.
5791784	5794906	What makes you say that no metalhead would ever play Guitar Freaks?
5795865	5799508	Because let's be honest, Guitar Freaks is silly.
5799688	5802650	You're playing this plastic guitar.
5802691	5805313	How about Drum Mania?
5805353	5808055	Now Drum Mania is a lot cooler than Guitar Freaks.
5808075	5810056	Drum Mania is actually hammered on a drum.
5810277	5814380	I can see somebody being like, you know, Guitar Freaks.
5814440	5815701	I play Guitar Freaks at home, right?
5815721	5817522	And I got my little plastic ukulele.
5818263	5821606	And I'm wailing out hard to whatever song I can play on the home version.
5823362	5825646	and I'm like, dude, I look stupid.
5826748	5828432	But in my mind, you know, I'm like...
5828973	5830274	You know, a god of rock.
5830995	5832676	And that's awesome.
5832756	5834738	But it's like, you're going to get a metalhead, right?
5834798	5839261	A real metalhead, which there aren't any more real metalheads.
5839281	5841563	People who play the guitars are metalheads.
5841643	5843204	People who play in a band are metalheads.
5843224	5845406	The people who are real metalheads play the guitar.
5845426	5847248	They don't play the guitar for you.
5847268	5848389	They play the real drums.
5848509	5849269	They play bass.
5849349	5850130	They play all that.
5850170	5850951	They're in a band.
5851291	5853793	I've seen guys with mullets playing guitar freaks.
5855304	5856685	Oh yeah, but no, no, no.
5856805	5858725	Bullet and Metalhead, well, okay.
5859646	5863107	Yeah, gotcha.
5863527	5864027	Think about it.
5864307	5867769	Think about the metalheads that play not only DDR, but Bomani games in general.
5868089	5868509	Like me.
5869389	5873231	You know, it started off with DDR, and then it moved on to other games, like 2DX.
5873251	5875211	And you never see a metalhead playing DDR.
5876572	5876872	Ever.
5876892	5879353	But Zaku is saying he is a metalhead who's playing DDR.
5879373	5879993	Zaku's a faker.
5882082	5885544	Metalheads do two things, right?
5885864	5888906	They smoke weed, and they listen to metal.
5889486	5890127	And that's it.
5890327	5891647	That is a stereotype.
5892108	5893128	Hey, man.
5893148	5893809	That's bull, man.
5893829	5894429	It's just a stereotype.
5894469	5896690	It wouldn't be a stereotype if it wasn't true.
5897090	5904855	You'd be surprised at the number of people that play DDR, not just regular... No, no, I wouldn't be... Trust me, I wouldn't be surprised at the number of people who play DDR.
5905315	5910118	I'd be surprised at the number of Metalheads who play DDR, because as far as I'm concerned, that number is zero.
5910238	5910438	Yes.
5911448	5913509	Well, no, you got one right here.
5913669	5915570	Okay, Zaku, congratulations.
5915610	5917531	You are the exception that proves the rule.
5918051	5918572	I'm wrong.
5919212	5927837	Metalheads are rushing to arcades right now to throw down the Mad Dance Dance action.
5927857	5936921	Because, you know, the brand of electronic hip-hop, or not even hip-hop, electronic pop music inside of it, really appeals to the rocker and their soul.
5938362	5939983	Yeah, but we're different.
5941004	5942508	Well, we play DDR, remember that.
5943289	5943931	Yes, you are.
5944372	5949844	Dude, nothing like B4U, the fucking J-pop metalhead rockers.
5949884	5950987	That's what I'm talking about!
5951553	5952434	You know it's true.
5952734	5959758	There is no self-respecting metalhead who would hear the music from a B-Mani machine and not run over and kill it.
5959978	5967642	Now maybe that one song we just heard might be the beginning of the metalhead B-Mani renaissance.
5968223	5969323	It's not happening.
5969583	5972105	I need to clarify something for Zaku.
5972425	5975687	We've made careers out of taking things out of context, okay?
5976327	5977408	Politicians do it every day.
5979082	5988826	And incidentally, the opinions of my fucked up self are in no way, shape, or form the opinions of Orange Lounge Radio or anybody else in the whole damn world.
5988846	5990066	But they're pretty damn funny.
5990246	5992207	Exactly, I agree with that.
5992247	5993207	Quit fucking on my program.
5993487	5998869	The fact of the matter is this, you know, there's not only two metalheads or any other type of people playing EDR.
5998889	6000449	You're taking off his headset.
6000469	6001990	People who listen to rap music, yes.
6002719	6009261	Yeah, no, rap people playing DDR, you know, punks, scots, metalheads, as I said before.
6009541	6010602	Almost everyone plays DDR.
6010622	6011462	Don't forget bags.
6011482	6012222	You might not know it.
6012883	6013303	Exactly.
6013323	6015263	That too.
6015844	6016304	Oh yeah!
6016484	6016884	Woo!
6016904	6017284	Woo!
6017304	6018084	Yeah!
6018244	6021346	Woo!
6021386	6027448	That's just killing it, man.
6028568	6029368	That's just killing it.
6030009	6030949	You just killed it right there.
6032066	6032386	Sorry.
6032986	6035027	Konami has the balls to go that far.
6035187	6037108	I mean, you know, live with it.
6037148	6038409	I mean, that's what they did.
6038789	6039689	It's already been done.
6039789	6043631	The license has already been acquired and it's going to be in there no matter what you say.
6044952	6045332	That's it.
6045352	6050214	Seriously, I've been arguing for years that there needs to be more metal music in Guitar Freaks.
6050774	6052075	Because it would appeal to me.
6053876	6057277	But again, I can't really see a real metalhead going out there playing.
6057817	6059118	Yeah, but you don't know that for sure.
6059682	6063483	I'm sorry if I'm talking over you, Rob's computer's crossing around.
6063863	6067545	You have to think of, you know, take for a second and think of, you know, Konami's rationale.
6067905	6071326	What do they want out of, you know, out of Guitar Freaks and any other Bomani game?
6071546	6072446	You know, more people.
6072926	6077388	They would sure, in most cases, they would love to pick up, you know, many types of people.
6077608	6083770	Not just, you know, the typical, you know, typical regular person who probably doesn't listen to metal, but just, you know, a new type.
6084490	6086050	Spread out their bass a little.
6086551	6087671	So that way they get everyone.
6088154	6090956	and they get more, you know, and that's more, you know, more sales than that.
6090976	6091837	Well, you know what?
6092077	6092498	You know what?
6092818	6095120	The bottom line is, and we gotta move on soon.
6095420	6104908	As much as I enjoy it when you call into the show, Saku, because damn, I haven't laughed this hard in months.
6105048	6110673	I think the Gita Dora mix is promising to be a very diverse selection of music.
6111654	6113736	And if we win over some metalheads...
6114440	6115321	Then, hey, great.
6115461	6118104	And if we don't, well, we always have the fags, right?
6118544	6120326	I mean, yeah.
6120426	6121667	It wins for everyone.
6121707	6124970	Because, you know, the more it's eclectic, the more everyone will join in.
6125251	6131857	Incidentally, since the games aren't meant for America anyway, they're just appealing to the Japanese metalhead.
6131897	6133919	And the Japanese metalhead is stuck in 1988.
6136267	6137748	When metal was metal.
6137848	6138970	That is a very good observation.
6139250	6142193	Before it was... On that note... More 80s rock.
6142533	6144596	On that note, Zach... Guitar freaks.
6151823	6152924	and I'm putting up the horns.
6152964	6153745	Watch the webcam.
6153765	6154285	The horns are up.
6154305	6155626	I think we should bury the hatchet right now.
6155666	6156266	I think it's done.
6156306	6158508	I think I flamed and ranted long enough.
6158868	6159949	I made my point clear.
6160169	6162671	Alright.
6162872	6164653	Have a good one, Zaku.
6164693	6167475	Thank you for your... Have a good one.
6167775	6168096	Later.
6168476	6168776	Bye.
6170277	6171718	I can hear that a little bit, by the way.
6171978	6172239	Alright.
6173780	6174300	Wow.
6178023	6179584	Damn, you need to come visit us more often.
6179604	6180645	That was good stuff.
6181386	6181726	Alright.
6182728	6184914	I need a break after that, I need to breathe a little bit
6186105	6189946	We'll open up the Skype line later for more of you guys who want to call in.
6190326	6192047	In the meantime, though, we've got a cage match to get to.
6192087	6194848	We want to get to the FUs of the week as well and some other news.
6195248	6197429	Maybe we'll have time for a DDR Freak post of the week.
6197529	6197849	I don't know.
6197869	6198269	We'll see.
6198369	6201130	Speaking of DDR Freak, Friday nights, check it out.
6201230	6202330	Orange Lounge Radio Rewind.
6202530	6205091	Maybe you are checking us out right now on the Rewind over there.
6205631	6213414	We appreciate their support in helping us out and their efforts to help us convert people to the Church of Orange Lounge.
6213434	6214254	Can I get an amen?
6215704	6216165	Amen!

6726092	6729535	We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio.
6730836	6732577	After, oh man, I had to catch my breath.
6732637	6734098	I was just laughing so hard.
6734398	6735299	Dan, you crack me up.
6735599	6736200	I'm glad you're here.
6736300	6737080	That's what I do.
6737261	6737901	You want to laugh?
6738101	6742404	Go buy an ignition pad at the Marconi GameStop.
6742645	6745327	I'll be the first in line to be berated by Dan.
6745427	6745887	That's right.
6746167	6748789	Dan will berate you and your taste in music in person.
6748829	6753173	Only if you step up saying, I'm the DDR playing metal freak.
6756764	6757104	You know what?
6757164	6761828	At the next DDR tournament, I'm going to find a bunch of metalheads to, you know, send you a special FU.
6761848	6763970	Zaku's already proven that he's the exception to the rule.
6764330	6767333	I think we can find at least one other.
6767353	6771016	There was another guy in the chatroom saying that he was... I'm saying my argument is now null and void.
6771817	6775480	I said no metalheads are Bimani fans, and he said I'm a metalhead, I don't want to be a metalhead.
6775700	6777461	I don't have a way to disprove his metalness.
6778182	6781144	I can't say that his Bimaniness makes him less of a metalhead.
6781485	6785348	The truth is the guy might eat, sleep, and breathe metal and then go out and play DDR.
6785888	6788650	Maybe he puts on a Walkman and listens to metal while he's playing DDR.
6788670	6790031	So basically you got pwned.
6790512	6791092	I got told.
6791633	6792373	That's what I said.
6792413	6794595	You know, you said, I'm metalhead.
6794635	6795836	I said, oh, I guess I'm wrong.
6796056	6796557	I got told.
6797117	6797517	All right.
6798538	6800660	Loki, you were wanting to mention something there?
6803142	6804943	Crap, I don't even remember now.
6806545	6808066	Damn, I don't remember.
6808706	6832954	I just tried to blank I was, I'm sure I was I appreciate it I don't want to alienate the listeners I cannot remember what the hell I was thinking It just like, poof, went away Oh, now I remember, now I remember I was just going to say, yeah, Metalhead's playing DDR That was like the black people watching the films nominated for the Oscars As Chris Rock was pointing out in the beginning of the Oscars That was great
6834557	6840818	Yeah, he was going around at what was the theater, the Magic Johnson Theater, asking the people if they'd seen Sideways or Million Dollar Baby.
6840838	6842639	They're like, no.
6842719	6844779	And he says, what was your favorite movie of the last year?
6844799	6846620	And some of them are like, Chronicles of Riddick.
6848580	6850581	Anyway, what are you laughing at there?
6850661	6851921	Tell the listeners what's up.
6851961	6857162	The link that DJ Ranma S posted in the chat room of the PlayStation 3.
6858823	6859903	It's not for real though, is it?
6859923	6860343	What is it?
6860443	6861643	It's a fake, but it's funny.
6862204	6863584	Nobody knows what the PlayStation 3 is.
6864298	6868162	Well, you know, we just got a new submission for Orange Launch Radio.
6868262	6871885	I'm having to turn it down because it's not citing a source for more information.
6872305	6883175	But somebody did send us a new submission that says, coming to us from SummerDog, says, Nintendo will debut the Nintendo Revolution in May at E3.
6883316	6885257	Well, we'll find out when we're at E3.
6886338	6886919	That's old news.
6887319	6892502	All three console makers were going to be debuting their new consoles at E3.
6892622	6894724	We'll be lucky to get a tech demo on the PS3.
6894744	6895885	That's not surprising.
6896205	6897085	I knew that was coming.
6897346	6898827	We'll be lucky to get a tech demo on the PS3.
6899007	6910374	And what people don't know is the connectivity with the DS, which will be with the new system, because it will be also wireless, Bluetooth, or whatever it is.
6911015	6913296	I think Sony will be downplaying the PS3 at E3.
6914097	6915818	I think they'll be really trying to push the PSP.
6917165	6919146	and I don't think they have enough of a system together yet.
6921187	6927330	All they've said is sell processor rocks and it's finished and that we're using an upgraded emotion engine as the I.O.
6927650	6930191	All I know is we're selling UMD movies now.
6930251	6931192	We're distributing them.
6933193	6934333	That's sad.
6934713	6937234	I don't really want to see that format take off at all.
6937675	6937995	It won't.
6938415	6941456	I think it's going to flop just like DVHS.
6941657	6943137	What's DVHS you may ask?
6943297	6943958	Yeah, that's right.
6943978	6944738	Digital VHS.
6946827	6956314	We were talking about this briefly on the podcast, which by the way, if you haven't checked out the podcast, check it out, www.orangeloungeradio.com and click on Orange Lounge Radio to go for more information on the podcast.
6956656	6957316	Check it out, bitches.
6957336	6959017	You'll see anything that's owned by Sony.
6959037	6959517	Yeah, and Spider-Man.
6959617	6960597	Columbia Pictures, Action Flick.
6986157	6988058	Yeah, you're not going to be seeing dramas on the PSP.
6988119	6990900	Exactly, you wouldn't see foreign films.
6991260	6993042	You're not going to see that stuff on a PSP.
6993082	6994963	With a new format, it's not going to happen.
6995883	6997825	DVD has taken over the market.
6998265	7000226	It's been the first thing since VHS to do so.
7000586	7003828	There's always been a superior format to VHS out there.
7005169	7005709	Like Beta.
7006390	7008051	Beta, Laserdisc.
7009296	7010016	All sorts of stuff.
7010337	7011638	None of it could ever take over the market.
7011718	7016844	The only thing I could see that possibly happened with this is the price point is pretty good.
7017004	7022970	It is $19.99 retail for these, which is kind of like that sweet number for movies and stuff.
7023951	7029057	You could see a new release movie coming out, UMD or whatever, at the same time.
7030057	7043968	But it's just really, honestly, the format, unless, and this is a big if, unless, like, the new PS3 is going to play UMD and DVD or something like that, you know, I don't really see any people buying stuff just to take it with them on the road.
7044008	7052375	I mean, do you really need to watch, you know, Spider-Man 2 that much?
7052595	7058380	And the difference, you know, a lot of times people, you know, have DVD players in cars, and I can see this is why they're trying to market this.
7059000	7065104	But that's because each individual kid has their own screen or there's a central screen there.
7065144	7070228	Kids are going to try to share a portable game system to watch a movie.
7070428	7071349	It's not going to happen.
7071709	7073971	Well, it's just that Sony develops technology.
7074631	7077333	And they feel compelled to use this technology somehow.
7077813	7078574	Like Minidisc.
7079134	7081676	How many years has Sony spent trying to pimp Minidisc?
7082496	7083857	They're still trying to pimp that shit.
7083877	7083998	700 years.
7085600	7091082	Yeah, they're still trying to push minidisc as a viable format, and minidisc will never be a viable format.
7091402	7093703	Yes, it has its uses, sure.
7094264	7095524	It's a neat little machine.
7096344	7099085	You know, if the PSP took minidiscs, that would rock.
7099826	7100686	But it's not happening.
7100706	7101807	That would have been a smart idea.
7101827	7101907	Yeah.
7103207	7105248	Because the discs are the same size, am I not correct?
7105588	7107429	Except for the UMD is rounded.
7108209	7108729	Oh, jeez.
7109810	7110050	So...
7110458	7115359	But yeah, it's like, if your PSP could play minidisc audio, that would be sick.
7117040	7120341	You know, it's the same thing with the UMD movie format.
7120401	7129763	It's like, Sony developed the technology, and they're a publicly traded company, so it took them, you know, a gajillion years, and stockholders are going like, what the crap are you going to do with this UMD?
7129803	7132504	And Sony was like, we're going to make a portable game system out of it.
7133164	7135085	Now they're like, we can play movies with it too.
7135625	7137765	So they feel compelled to use it.
7139086	7139766	And that's good.
7140866	7146412	It'd be nice that it takes off, and I think that it's cool to have a handheld that's going to play discs.
7146873	7157484	And this proprietary new format will never, ever, ever be able to be pirated to a PC to be played on an emulator, or pirated over the internet.
7157524	7161729	Because it's proprietary, and they just can't read them.
7162692	7165214	You know that in like 20 minutes they're going to be on Licksang.
7167215	7171418	Licksang's going to be like, you can only buy these for purposeful backing up.
7171718	7172218	Very legal.
7173039	7173639	Don't pirate.
7174460	7175180	You'll get a suit.
7178883	7179643	Hey, man.
7180484	7180864	All right.
7181324	7185187	Well, we'll see how the format does when the launch of the PSP is coming up very soon.
7185307	7186468	Do you remember the launch date?
7186548	7187749	March 24th.
7187789	7188349	March 24th.
7188469	7189550	If you live in the Sacramento area.
7190014	7193256	GameStop, Marconi and Fulton, come reserve yours now.
7193376	7199298	If you don't, when you come in to buy one, and I don't have any because I won't, I'm going to laugh my ass off.
7200839	7202400	I will not be getting a PSP on lunch today.
7202840	7204121	We'll have our, you can check it out.
7204281	7205021	Alright, that sounds good.
7205061	7205761	I traded in a DS.
7206702	7207962	Oh, see, I love my DS.
7207982	7208543	We had two.
7208703	7209523	I still have my DS.
7209543	7210023	Oh, that's good.
7210644	7211904	It's our DS now.
7212865	7214125	It lives in my laptop now.
7214345	7215806	Okay, well I guess it's my PSP.
7216646	7217127	Alright.
7217167	7217727	God told.
7219144	7220765	Jamie just popped me the bird.
7221766	7224748	Can you believe that that kind of behavior would be going on here?
7225669	7226150	Look at that.
7227130	7231214	Well, if you think about what it means in slang terms, you know, hey, hot.
7231674	7232014	All right.
7232495	7233195	Yeah.
7233315	7236538	Let's get to the Orange Lounge Radio cage match, shall we?
7241331	7245814	Three songs doing battle with each other and you get to pick the winner.

7269995	7273638	The one that gets the most votes from you guys in the chatroom goes into rotation all week long.
7274359	7276800	You only get to hear a clip of the song that won last week.
7277321	7287328	And speaking of last week, we actually had a song win for the third time, which means if it wins tonight, it is retired forever.
7287649	7288269	Thank God.
7288309	7290651	And it will become only the third song...
7291232	7292253	Orange Lounge History
7328613	7330496	I'm on a stakeout I'm on a stakeout
7351573	7352534	Thank you for watching!
7380743	7390646	The feeling is elating, biding my time Yeah, I know that you'll soon be mine Soon to mine Can't let you see me Can't let you see me Can't let you see me
7425655	7430558	Alright, that was last week's winner for the third time in a row, Freeze Pop with Stakeout.
7430618	7434140	Let's get into some new songs that are going to challenge that tonight.
7434160	7436862	And we're going to start it off with Loki's pick.
7437062	7438502	Loki, what did you pick for us tonight?
7441044	7441344	Girls.
7441364	7442165	What the hell?
7443085	7446187	Okay, I picked... No, I did not pick girls.
7446667	7448688	That joke is old and done with.
7449689	7449889	I meant...
7450433	7452054	I missed my opportunity for that joke.
7452074	7452775	Don't worry, I'll come back.
7453175	7455397	And so I picked a different song.
7455477	7460740	I picked another, a different drum label artist.
7461161	7463542	And this group is called the Dignity of Labor.
7464303	7469807	And their song, actually the one only song I see that this artist has done, at least it's on a different drum.
7469827	7473349	It's called XRV, the Never Rock A Mix.
7474050	7477072	And it's, I don't know what the hell an XRV is.
7477771	7482815	I didn't listen to the lyrics of the song, but it sounds cool, so this is the song for you.
7485557	7486638	Alright, from a different drum.
7487138	7489740	The Dignity of Labor, XRV, The Never Rockin' Me.
7489961	7500829	And I even edited it down for you guys, because, you know, it was a club-type song, you know, so I edited the end down, so don't listen to all that, you know, drum track and everything.
7501630	7503171	But it's still a good six minutes long.
7504692	7505773	It's like five and a half.
7507034	7508535	My thing says six and a half.
7510777	7512258	It's not six and a half.
7512458	7513099	It should not be.
7513479	7514620	Hold on a second here.
7516721	7518402	Oh, you probably copied it earlier.
7518523	7519743	Does that say edit on it?
7521225	7523426	Okay, that's because you didn't copy the right one.
7525247	7526248	I was prepared.
7526388	7528910	You just tried to screw me over.
7529411	7529731	Damn it.
7532276	7538059	I had it all ready to go for you, and I took all the extra time to edit it down for you, and you know what?
7539660	7540840	This is the thanks I get.
7543682	7547844	See, the 6.5 version would have been the one with the outro on it.
7548464	7550425	So I got rid of that, so you don't have to listen to it.
7551686	7553647	So now we have the one that's good.
7556988	7558109	Alright, here it is.
7558269	7559870	Dignity of Labor, XRV.
7559930	7560230	Enjoy.
7562645	7563309	YXR, VVVVV
7615433	7616844	There is a fallacy
7772825	7778969	All I generate, there is no form I cannot penetrate.
7779290	7784013	If only you could see the pain I feel in you.
7784133	7790918	A mirror to your soul is free, without a trace of vanity.
7791078	7793680	I'll share with you the mastery.
7793700	7796262	Reveal your agony with exalting you.
7799884	7801588	Thanks for watching!
7901653	7903754	Okay, that was song number two in tonight's cage match.
7903834	7907376	The Dignity of Labor with XRV, the Neveraka mix.
7907856	7912439	Was that A-OK or was it A-S-S?
7912979	7913400	Jamie?
7913920	7918222	There wasn't enough variation in it to really make it... It was very generic sounding, I'm sorry.
7918282	7918983	It gets so sick.
7921624	7923405	It was better than Freeze Pop, I'll give it that.
7924826	7927367	Better than Freeze Pop, that's all you need to know.
7928688	7930409	Loki, is that all you have to say about it anymore?
7931283	7932824	It's better than Freeze Pop.
7933544	7935505	Anything is better than Freeze Pop.
7935765	7936306	Anything.
7938227	7938747	Anything.
7938867	7939267	I mean it.
7939587	7940308	Give it a score.
7941869	7943770	It gets a better than Freeze Pop score.
7944730	7949353	Dan, your opinion on the song, and then you give it something on a scale of 1 to 10.
7949793	7951113	That song was eternal.
7951814	7953335	I didn't think it would ever end.
7955016	7956856	That being said, it didn't suck.
7957057	7958277	It was just really long.
7958717	7959618	Talk a little bit about it.
7961973	7964694	I disagree with Loki, Freeze Pop is better than that song.
7964994	7969996	Not that that song was bad, it was just very, very, very long and very, very, very dry.
7970656	7980300	Like, I think I could cut about a minute and a half out of that song and I'd really like it, but as far as the six and a half minute marathon mix, man, whatever, no.
7980360	7983681	So I give it a six for the number of minutes it almost was.
7984001	7988303	For dry, long songs, I realize it's awesome.
7988363	7989944	Jamie, your turn, your pick.
7989964	7990804	What did you pick for us tonight?
7991415	7994376	Um, I know it's a remix of Bloodhound Gang.
7994976	7995496	It sure is.
7996016	7996636	The Bad Touch.
7996656	7997116	The Bad Touch.
7997316	7999277	Yes, but it's by KMFDM.
7999397	7999657	Yeah.
7999937	8001017	Which should be interesting.
8003818	8004198	Alright.
8004578	8009939	Yeah, I had forgotten that I had it and then I looked on a DVD and was like, oh, I have this, cool.
8011219	8012420	Alright, so here it is.
8012440	8013340	Anything else you want to say about it?
8014360	8014840	Cool.
8015120	8015660	Let's do it.
8015880	8018601	Bloodhound Gang, The Bad Touch, KMFDM mix.
8018681	8018981	Enjoy.
8027236	8035411	Well now, we call this the act of mating, but there are several other very important differences between human beings and animals that you should know about.
8078355	8098243	I want you smothered, want you covered, like my Waffle House Ash Browns, I'm a disc of the FedEx, never reaching a fix, just like a football stock You are a clown to make me rise an hour early, just like daylight's taking time You and me, baby, ain't nothing but mammals, so let's do it like they do on the Discovery Channel You and me, baby, ain't nothing but mammals, so let's do it like they do on the Discovery Channel
8125794	8134812	Lost Catacombs of Egypt, only God knows where we stuck it Hieroglyphics, let me be specific, I wanna be down in your southeast But I got this notion that the motion of your ocean
8154597	8155481	Thanks for watching!
8186327	8213061	Nothing but mammals, so let's do it like they do on the Discovery Channel Do it again now You and me, baby, ain't nothing but mammals So let's do it like they do on the Discovery Channel Do it now You and me, baby, ain't nothing but mammals So let's do it like they do on the Discovery Channel Do it again now You and me, baby, ain't nothing but mammals So let's do it like they do on the Discovery Channel
8251188	8251794	Thanks for watching!
8282515	8287517	Alright, that was Bloodhound Gang with Bad Touch, KMFDM Mix, song number 3 tonight.
8287557	8290218	Let's see what the folks in the studio thought of that one.
8290278	8290578	Jamie?
8292319	8298261	I love that song, and I had, you know, set it aside, and then I found the mix, I was like, I love this mix!
8298921	8303803	It's a great mix of a great song, so it gets a 9.8 infinity.
8303903	8306544	It's both of our own songs.
8307409	8313194	Because I get to vote for any damn song I want to as official goddess of this radio station.
8313254	8316977	Well, also you have to remember though, yeah, you got pwned again.
8317277	8322501	You have to remember that we actually don't get to vote for the winner.
8322581	8324342	We just get to give our big fat opinions.
8324622	8325663	It's like American Idol.
8326064	8328726	Simon gets to give his opinion, but he doesn't get to pick the winner.
8329586	8330167	So it's like that.
8330767	8331728	Loki, your opinion.
8332929	8334110	Gets a 10 because it's KMFDM.
8334190	8334390	Fair.
8337663	8339124	And it's better than Freeze Pop.
8341746	8345009	I actually like the original song quite a bit, but I'm sorry, Jamie.
8345089	8347111	I really did not dig that remix at all.
8347991	8348832	I wasn't feeling it.
8348912	8349372	I'm sorry.
8349572	8353836	I like the Eiffel 65 mix of that song a lot, but maybe because it's more Euro.
8353896	8354276	I don't know.
8354396	8355577	But I wasn't into that one.
8356218	8358099	I can only really give that a 6 as well.
8358319	8358720	I'm sorry.
8359760	8360081	Dan.
8361001	8362803	That remix was the mad generic.
8363583	8364044	It's like...
8364702	8365403	Words from the song.
8367384	8368204	Words from the song.
8368905	8370546	It gets like a four and a half.
8371006	8375009	That's only because if I score it any lower, Jamie will throw heavier things at me.
8377210	8380413	Alright, well while Jamie... Oh, three and a half.
8380553	8390379	While Jamie finds something heavy to throw at Dan, let's recap the three songs you can vote for tonight, starting with Freeze Pops, Stakeout.
8390479	8391100	One and a half.
8391380	8392140	Six point nine.
8398280	8402141	Song number two, The Dignity of Labor with XRV.
8413704	8419345	And song number three, The Bloodhound Gang with Bad Touch, the Apple 60, I'm sorry, Bad Touch.
8419585	8421886	And no Euro crap on my song, thank you.
8423226	8424347	Sorry, wishful thinking there.
8424607	8425947	The KMFDM Mix.
8437715	8438595	All right, guys.
8438756	8441197	Place vote now.
8441357	8446141	Send a private message to Sky in the chat room with your votes.
8446341	8448002	Boy, did I fuck that one up, didn't I?
8454007	8455448	Now your words are a mix.
8457069	8457389	All right.
8457950	8460952	Loki, what's going on in the sim scene lately?
8464102	8467869	Have we heard any more news about the election that was last year?
8471816	8473319	What in the hell are you talking about?
8474090	8477351	Just say no, because there's nothing going on in the sim scene!
8477771	8479531	Nothing, zero, nada!
8480531	8486272	There's more going on in my bathroom right now than there is in the goddamn sim scene.
8486612	8487572	Zilch.
8487632	8488112	Nothing.
8488533	8491053	To be honest, there's more sim files out there.
8491093	8491593	Guess what?
8491613	8492793	They still suck.
8493833	8500895	There's more really crappy songs that people make that still really suck, and there's more Max remixes out there that still really suck.
8501615	8502275	To be honest...
8503773	8504715	Thank you for watching!
8522421	8538859	Really, you know, get into another game, maybe, you know, discover girls, I don't know, just something else, but really, there's nothing going on at all in the sim scene, nothing nada, except for one little thing, and that's just that this is...
8540760	8542361	Loki, doing his part to promote the hobby.
8542381	8544922	This is a DDRXXMix official website.
8545262	8549104	They're doing version 2.0 right now, and they have this funny little thing on there.
8549224	8552165	I just have to read it because it's just, you know, funny.
8552845	8556026	And it is this little English thing.
8556086	8559808	It says, how we stand as dancer to dance.
8560208	8564290	So I just thought that was funny, and that's all that I have to contribute as far as that.
8567131	8569232	How can we stand as dancer to dance?
8570256	8570677	DDRUK is gone.
8591327	8593869	DDR Maniacs is never coming back as far as I'm concerned.
8593909	8596631	It's been gone for months, so really, does anyone miss it?
8596711	8597432	No.
8598893	8599894	It's just, it's gone.
8601475	8605678	DDR UK, I'm sure they're going to come back someday, but it's going to be too late anyways.
8605758	8609220	It's just like the melting pot, remember that old-ass site that used to be around?
8610101	8610521	It's gone.
8613513	8616355	I'm afraid to say it, but yeah, there's nothing going on in the sim scene.
8616375	8617396	The sim scene's dying.
8617756	8618196	It's gone.
8619817	8620958	It's really, there's not much left.
8621198	8622259	So, that's it.
8624340	8624760	Now, wait a minute.
8624800	8628142	I played a cool thing that one of our listeners did.
8628182	8633385	He did a Simphile to the Gem theme song by FreezePop, and it was pretty rad, I gotta say.
8633485	8634186	Check it out, guys.
8634846	8635467	It's pretty rad.
8636147	8636928	It is outrageous.
8637468	8639849	Truly, truly, truly outrageous.
8641050	8642591	Dude, the Misfits songs are better.
8644696	8646297	I want, you know what I want?
8646538	8673039	Oh my god, oh my god, sim people, oh my god, sim people, sim people Oh my god, oh my god, do this Get all of Jem's songs and make like an all Jem DDR mix And you can have some Misfits songs too because they were cool too But like, I want to make like this whole mix of DDR just out of songs that were featured in Jem Tell me that would not rock That would not rock You're a liar!
8674164	8674965	Yes, I am.
8677267	8677848	Come on, Loki.
8678108	8679990	They can open up DDRUK back up for this.
8681632	8689220	I was just going to give you an example here of why there's nothing available right now.
8689400	8690762	And I really got to find the song.
8690822	8695827	I downloaded it earlier, and I know I'm probably not going to find it because there's just too much shit out there right now.
8697785	8698445	Here we go.
8699246	8708788	Okay, this is a perfect example of why you do not need... I mean, just sim files nowadays, they're just really bad.
8709129	8718211	And I cannot stress how bad they are, but I think I can come close with this song right here.
8718651	8723413	Now, granted, it's not as colorful as Mac's vagina, but you know what?
8723693	8723873	It's...
8724864	8725645	Pretty bad.
8725925	8727366	And this is a sim file.
8727967	8741518	You can go out there and you can definitely thank Thunderbird, that's B-Y-R-D, 24 on BomaniStyle.com for this wonderful piece of crap.
8741958	8747342	This is six subs, seven grams of fat.
8748463	8750165	Or seven subs of six grams of fat.
8751366	8751606	Enjoy.
8770069	8770250	Hey!
8770511	8772659	This is the week with you!
8802222	8804583	You make this song stop and you make it stop now.
8805224	8807065	Ow, my eardrums.
8808526	8809727	How do I unplug your computer?
8809767	8814229	How do I do it?
8815970	8817971	Please, turn it off.
8819132	8820113	Jesus, yes I can.
8820353	8821654	Oh dear God.
8821894	8826436	See, that right there is why this stuff sucks.
8826857	8829538	Really, do we need this crap?
8830239	8830619	Honestly.
8833416	8834597	This is why the sim scene is dying.
8834717	8835438	It's because of this crap.
8836859	8837159	I'm done.
8840261	8840681	Alright.
8845404	8852048	Well, I just made a last call for cage match votes, and it's been about 30 seconds, so I think that's enough time.
8852088	8853869	Do you guys want to know who won tonight's cage match?
8855390	8855791	Sure.
8856451	8857131	Do we ever.
8857392	8859433	This is a very interesting situation.
8862508	8865110	One vote yet again decides the cage match.
8866591	8870414	And it decides the cage match to be a tie once again.
8870914	8872015	Tie cage match.
8872856	8874877	Song number one tied tonight.
8880221	8883443	Dignity of Labor, XRV.
8884544	8887246	And song number two tied tonight.
8888991	8889871	Freeze Pop.
8893112	8902376	And let's go to the rule book that shows that, oh yes, if in case of a tie, the host whose song did not get picked gets to break the tie.
8902436	8910679	So Jamie, is she going to retire Freeze Pop or is she going to deny Freeze Pop that right and pick the other song?
8910739	8911779	Freeze Pop's going down.
8912079	8915780	On one hand, I could torture all of our listeners with more Freeze Pop.
8915800	8916681	You did that last time.
8916881	8917661	I did that last time.
8920586	8921706	Rob, Rob.
8921987	8922207	Yes.
8922727	8923527	Rob.
8923567	8923767	What?
8924848	8925408	Loser!
8926488	8927228	Ha ha!
8927609	8928769	Loser!
8929789	8931290	That's alright, that's alright.
8931510	8934111	Rob.
8934331	8934691	What?
8934711	8934791	What?
8937612	8940413	Alright, so new winner tonight, thanks to Jamie.
8940793	8944615	Jamie denies Freeze Pop the entrance to retire.
8945835	8946875	XRV wins.
8946935	8948176	But in reality, kids...
8948834	8951556	If you don't agree with that, maybe you should have gotten your friend to vote.
8951757	8955480	Because only one vote made the difference there.
8957021	8957382	Alright.
8959483	8962426	So next week you all get Britney Spears remix, courtesy of me.
8962546	8963947	So enjoy that next week.
8964668	8965229	Awesome.
8965249	8968311	We're going to have an awesome cage match next week.
8969192	8971014	Loki's going to play that song we just heard.
8974673	8977174	All right, yes, we definitely need the FUs after that one.
8977515	8980076	So we're going to go to break, and then when we come back, the FUs of the week.
8980536	8983878	So send us your FUs over private message, and we'll get to them.
8984038	8986139	In this break, you get a potpourri.
8986439	8988060	You get potpourri de mamani.
8990241	8991362	Potpourri de mamani.
8991382	8992423	Potpourri, rock.
8992463	8993083	Potpourri.
8993903	8997165	Starting it off with Setsugeka from TenStyle.
8998586	8999086	We'll be back.
8999547	9000267	More Orange Launch Radio.
9140154	9140815	Thanks for watching!
9163257	9164218	Thank you for watching!
9288325	9288810	Thank you.
9383971	9388055	Hello everybody, welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio.
9388155	9395621	We are going to get into the FUs of the week fairly shortly here.
9404918	9407381	Thank you guys for being loyal and sticking with us.
9423795	9424855	I know, I don't care this year.
9425336	9438880	The only ones I saw, I saw Finding Neverland, which I really, really liked, but for some reason people wanted to stay far away from that movie, but it was really good, I guess because supposedly the guy was an accused child molester or something, but it was a good movie, whatever, let it just be a movie.
9439900	9441501	And I saw Sideways, which was also funny.
9442495	9442976	And they suck.
9442996	9443296	Who cares?
9460143	9467686	And actually, I would say the best motion picture of the year would be Paris Hilton's sex tape, actually, would be the Oscar winner for this year.
9468667	9471828	I don't know if you saw it, but it was a fine performance by Miss Hilton.
9471848	9472368	Negative.
9473529	9474149	Negative.
9474849	9481532	When she just stops in the middle of what she's doing to pick up that cell phone, I was moved.
9482452	9483853	There was no dramatic focus.
9484395	9492298	Personally, I thought that the art direction in Cameron Diaz, the bondage video that she did, was much better.
9492698	9493158	Say what?
9494119	9497240	Yeah, there's a Cameron Diaz bondage video.
9497300	9498760	It's fucking hot!
9500381	9500641	Anyways.
9500661	9504202	We have to use Jamie's computer to look up some porn.
9507224	9509104	Now we know where that spyware is coming from.
9509484	9509765	We did...
9511750	9524275	We did watch, I don't know, like 10 minutes of the Oscars while it was sitting here on the TV, and we were waiting for the show to start, and Drew Barrymore came out, and what did Loki say something about, I saw a movie with her in it where she was naked and had blood on her boobs.
9524395	9524856	What was that?
9525276	9526476	What was that you were talking about?
9527317	9537681	She was in this really shitty horror movie, and I don't remember the name of it, but there was a shower scene where blood was coming out of the shower heads, and it was going over her breasts, so she was being...
9538510	9543132	It was her, naked, with her boobies, and her boobies were being covered by fake blood.
9544852	9545193	Oh yeah.
9546373	9548794	And the funny thing about Drew Barrymore was she was like 10 at the time.
9549614	9557697	And she was already cracked out and had to take these really bad movies to keep her career alive.
9559918	9560318	Wow.
9562239	9564340	Let's move on to the FUs of the week, shall we?
9565120	9567841	Jamie, why is it we do these FUs of the week every single week?
9570919	9574262	Because Danny hates humanity.
9574282	9576964	That includes all of you.
9577064	9578946	I mean, all of this is bad.
9578966	9581028	But here is justice.
9581068	9582429	Here is punishment.
9582449	9585251	Here is... This is fucked up!
9586052	9587453	They expect you to dust.
9588654	9591977	And the two years of it we... worth of it that we stirred up.
9591997	9593058	Five years.
9593078	9594880	You didn't live in that damn apartment for five years.
9594900	9595540	Four years.
9597242	9598223	Lots of years.
9599600	9600801	Shut up, my F.U.
9602702	9603262	Big F.U.
9603302	9604123	to my allergies.
9604723	9604944	F.U.
9604964	9607785	to stupid people who speed past me in the rain.
9609807	9609947	F.U.
9609987	9611488	to Dan for interrupting me.
9612048	9613489	Yeah.
9614350	9616291	I'm surprised that actually you guys don't get an F.U.
9616311	9617672	to Dan every week.
9618612	9621814	In fact, I think that by now it should just be a feature.
9622195	9623215	So, Jamie, F.U.
9623255	9623976	to Dan, right?
9624436	9625477	Fucking duh.
9626537	9626818	Dan.
9628419	9628959	Shut up, please.
9629927	9632269	Or I'll throw the ferret at you.
9634270	9634991	Throw the ferret?
9635031	9636252	Does that mean what I think it means?
9637492	9637993	It doesn't.
9641976	9644157	And F you to being sick for a week.
9646098	9646899	Ow, you bitch!
9647940	9648860	I threw the ferret back.
9650662	9653904	The voice thing landed on my collarbone.
9653924	9655285	F you to pain.
9656306	9657186	Collarbone nothing.
9657566	9658307	I hit her in the rack.
9658769	9659329	I'm a good throw.
9659349	9660930	You hit me on my damn collarbone.
9661230	9662651	Shut up, this is radio, they don't know.
9666332	9667633	You hit my laptop, you die.
9667653	9672635	Aha, deflected.
9672715	9675937	She wears such a bad aim.
9677317	9677897	Uh, FUs?
9678358	9678738	Oh yeah.
9679418	9682980	Um, FU to being distracted by the ferret being thrown by Dan.
9685201	9686901	FU to my laundry not being dry yet.
9687802	9688222	And, uh,
9689475	9692904	SU to Chipotle for having really good rice that I can't eat.
9693826	9694307	Loki.
9696533	9696854	Loki.
9702397	9706619	First off, fuck you the Oscars, because they still suck.
9706819	9710480	Even if you do get Chris Rock to host it, that does not make them any better.
9710580	9711660	They just still suck.
9711960	9713981	And I feel sorry for Chris Rock for having to do that.
9714481	9720543	I know he's hard up on money, and the need to take that job, but my god.
9721003	9722084	You know, what's going to be next?
9722164	9724185	Dave Chappelle hosting the Oscars?
9724925	9728466	That might get me to watch it, but I don't think it's going to happen.
9729096	9748286	Um, fuck you to my computer for, first off, you know, the power supply being all fucked up, and then I had to get a new one, and then the stupid little fan that was, you know, cooling my graphics, uh, proc card there, uh, well, it's too noisy, so I had to pull it out of there as well, and come to find out it wasn't doing shit.
9748586	9749086	Actually, the...
9749426	9752708	Fan was not even over the heat sink, so it was doing nothing.
9753149	9754129	So that kind of was lame.
9754630	9760794	And then, um, fuck you to Final Fantasy because it's been all laggy and weird lately.
9761454	9762215	I don't know why.
9762275	9766478	It's like you'd think that they hosted the servers in the United States or something.
9766618	9768599	Because, I mean, they're really shitty.
9769260	9775824	And then, uh, fuck you to Golf Land because, once again, you just do not maintain your stuff there.
9775924	9776825	I mean, my god.
9777885	9778506	I can't believe...
9779279	9782982	You would think that they were Microsoft or something with all the shit that was broken there.
9784563	9785364	I just don't get it.
9786565	9791689	And, um... Finally, um... Fuck these Macs because they suck.
9791749	9798314	Okay, I'm done.
9801276	9802517	F you to Final Fantasy XI.
9803318	9805640	I'm really getting sick of your bullshit, you little game.
9806561	9808282	Link, come over here so I can kick your ass.
9810789	9815072	and F you to me sleeping 12 hours yesterday and 10 hours today.
9815092	9815893	That's a lot of sleep.
9817154	9822218	And F you to some drama that was going on last week.
9822958	9827422	Oh my god, F you to big projects that fall in my lap at the last freaking minute.
9827542	9828363	I hate that stuff.
9828423	9828923	I hate it!
9829744	9831385	You guys have more advance notice of this.
9831445	9834187	Quit giving it to me at the last minute and then making me, like, die.
9834327	9834808	I hate that.
9835128	9837470	I hate you neither.
9845500	9846120	I have not.
9846321	9848222	I can't say I have.
9848502	9855608	And then F you to people bitching about the Oscars because, you know, I have to do this show.
9856029	9863575	I don't get to go to the big gay Oscar party and sit around and be catty and talk about how ugly everybody looks in their dress with people.
9864035	9865316	The big gay party.
9865917	9866157	Yes.
9867524	9870846	If I wasn't doing this show, I would be at a big gay Oscar party right now.
9871086	9871627	I know I would.
9872447	9875309	Because the Oscars are the Super Bowls for gays.
9875469	9875770	It is.
9877130	9882594	If I wasn't doing this show, I'd be at an Oscar party too because we're having a free one at work and I get free booze and food.
9883495	9885597	That's the only reason I'd go though, is for the free booze and food.
9885857	9887258	I wouldn't go because of the Oscars.
9887298	9888038	Fuck the Oscars.
9888599	9888879	I'd just
9889201	9891863	I do what I do for all of our company parties.
9891963	9894144	I go get food, get full, and leave.
9894825	9897506	And say, fuck them, I ain't waiting for the end of year party.
9898307	9898747	Totally.
9898827	9900608	Free food would have rocked.
9901169	9903770	I could go for, like, some cocktail weenies right now.
9904090	9905251	Don't make the gay joke.
9905431	9905832	Stop.
9906092	9906572	Stop it.
9906832	9910134	We did that for the Seinfeld last episode.
9910474	9912256	We totally crushed the Seinfeld party.
9912396	9913436	Ate their food and left.
9915658	9916918	Were there cocktail weenies there?
9916938	9917699	No, they had cake.
9918717	9919437	Cake is good.
9920418	9923480	See, I could be eating Oscar cake right now, but I'm doing this show.
9926722	9927323	I'm spent.
9928243	9930525	Jamie, you have one you wanted to add, okay?
9930545	9934587	F you to Squenix for pushing back the date for the Final Fantasy XI Atlas.
9935268	9935588	That's it.
9936929	9938069	Are they writing it themselves?
9938470	9943733	I think you gotta blame Brady Games for that one.
9943953	9944874	Brady Games took it anyway.
9945974	9947775	Dan, did you have any FUs of the week you wanted to give?
9948115	9965471	I'd like to level a giant FU at Ultracade who think that they're super clever trying to trademark the name MAME and the logo for MAME because he wants, you know, to have, I guess, a hold on the emulation market.
9966852	9970435	The guy's name is David R. Foley and he's an asshole.
9971317	9974079	And he'll never win because it's not his logo to begin with.
9974220	9977983	Oh yeah, it predates his company by like, what, five years?
9979724	9981165	Ultracade, by the way, sucks.
9981786	9982647	Ultracade sucks.
9982947	9988091	And I bet you if you take apart an Ultracade and decompile his source code, I bet you that it's made anyway.
9988792	9989312	Faster.
9991994	9994697	And that's about it.
9994857	9996338	Ultracades need to burn in hell.
9996678	9999541	And I was all down with Ultracade because I'm like, dude, that's a good idea.
10000265	10004889	I was going to save that for, you know, our podcast, but whatever.
10006370	10007051	Hey, that's all good.
10007651	10008352	Sorry about that.
10008572	10009172	Oh, no biggie.
10009533	10010533	Talk about it on the show.
10011274	10012715	Say fuck off to Ultracade.
10013556	10014537	Y'all go to arcades.
10014917	10017819	You go to arcades, kick the Ultracade when you walk by it.
10019101	10020021	I did yesterday.
10020802	10022383	I'm not just talking boot at once.
10022403	10025045	I'm talking kick the fucking hell out of it.
10025065	10025386	Okay.
10026226	10026667	You know what?
10026847	10028048	We'll make that the first...

10057694	10060575	Let's move on to the chatroom FUs, unless you had anything else.
10061636	10061976	I'm done.
10062856	10063397	Fuck all for me.
10063557	10064177	I want chocolate.
10066078	10068579	I've been eating like so much ice cream today, it's disgusting.
10068739	10069559	I'm rating Rob Scrooge.
10071560	10073881	Alright, let's go on to the next chatroom FUs.
10076302	10084886	Zaku, our old buddy Zaku, the metalhead, says FU to actor-director Clint Eastwood for denying veteran director Martin Scorsese his chance at an Oscar.
10086334	10089036	If Martin Scorsese wasn't such a cocksucker, he'd win more awards.
10093680	10094841	Clint Eastwood deserved it.
10095662	10097903	Don't get in another argument with him, please.
10098023	10100425	Can you give the man a hug, please, Dan?
10100485	10100846	Negative.
10103368	10104068	Can you try?
10104128	10105470	Can you give the man a cyber hug?
10105710	10109092	If he's a real metalhead, he's all greasy and nasty and doesn't want to be hugged.
10110133	10111074	All right, fine.
10111374	10112295	How about a handshake?
10112555	10113276	How about a handshake?
10114277	10115377	I'll give him a bong hit.
10115598	10115918	All right.
10116776	10118457	Loki, what were you going to add to that?
10120218	10120698	Nothing?
10122019	10122459	Nothing.
10124900	10129862	F you to my mouth being held tightly by a rubber band because of my braces and the pain it brings.
10130343	10131063	I've been there.
10131363	10131863	It's horrible.
10132664	10135305	F you to having two unmerciful midterms this week.
10135345	10139387	And F you to people that rag on Dillager Escape Plan's song in Guitadora V.
10141431	10144872	Illusion says, F you to all the freeze pop haters.
10144972	10146612	It's all about fancy ultra fresh.
10147152	10150913	I read a review that said the CD sucked and it was better used as a frisbee.
10151593	10156554	Then I scrolled up on the page and saw their glowing review of Yellow Card CD, Ocean Avenue.
10156894	10158135	Then I said, oh, I get it.
10158175	10159455	You have horrible taste in music.
10159915	10161075	Anyway, I'm rambling.
10161956	10162856	F you to Jamie.
10163076	10164736	It was one week from retirement.
10164976	10165476	One week.
10167277	10167777	You know what?
10167877	10168497	Suck it up.
10170205	10171586	Got told, bitches!
10171606	10176468	If your song was good, it would have made it the four weeks, but it sucked!
10177729	10180810	No, better yet, F you to the people that voted for the song.
10183112	10185953	Illusion continues on saying, P.S.
10186253	10190495	F you to that awful Guitar Freaks drum mania song that you played earlier.
10190916	10192937	It's like my ears were on there, period.
10195058	10195658	No, man.
10195678	10196679	No, no, no, no, no.
10196919	10199260	I take offense to this because...
10199878	10203301	No man will ever, ever know what that's like.
10204461	10206843	No one will ever know what the pain of PMS is.
10207944	10209605	That's why we have to share with our attitude.
10209685	10210666	Oh, I think we do.
10217071	10218792	You'd like to think that, wouldn't you?
10219492	10224796	No, see, we have to suffer the physical pain, so we share the emotional pain with you.
10224836	10227238	Come on, what's worse, physical or emotional pain?
10229702	10231722	Life Long Torture.
10231902	10232483	That's okay.
10232523	10234623	I'll just get advice for your balls next time.
10234643	10236403	It's Punishment From Above.
10241685	10243825	I'd like to level a fuck you to PMS.
10245265	10249526	That goddamn excuse for women to be bitchy doesn't need to exist.
10250866	10251847	Fucking deal with it.
10251887	10255587	It's going to happen for the rest of your life.
10257748	10258168	No, it won't.
10258937	10263261	When menopause hits, you get it every day for the rest of your life.
10263281	10265262	I've still got like seven people to go through.
10265382	10266463	That's when you get killed.
10267084	10268785	I heard it here first.
10272508	10273889	Did you ever see Logan's run?
10275911	10276571	Exactly.
10277272	10278072	We've got a runner.
10278693	10285598	You know that when they're pregnant, they're front heavy, so when you just put them next to a cliff or something, two birds with one stone, man.
10286980	10287360	Nice.
10289035	10292739	Oh, hey, look, what are you doing throwing the weasel at somebody, or the weasel?
10292759	10295362	What are you doing throwing the ferret at somebody else?
10295943	10296423	Slut.
10296944	10298105	I used to throw it at Rob.
10298125	10301188	Oh yeah, but we know Rob's not going to throw it at me.
10301208	10304652	My cheeks hurt from laughing so hard, okay?
10305092	10305533	Seriously.
10305553	10305773	Seriously.
10308672	10314756	Lama Juice says, F you to Fred who works at Red Octane and I'm so damn glad his ass got fired.
10314796	10319059	He lost a lot of people's orders making me wait another month for my Octane pad.
10319739	10324963	F you to school because apparently they had no problem sending them to GameStop, however.
10325263	10328405	They're all at the GameStop on Marconi.
10330066	10332488	Come and buy your damn dance pad.
10333200	10339602	A big F you to the GameStop Distribution Center for sending me 14 red octane ignition pads.
10341023	10344544	Llama Juice also says F you to school because I have to wake up early tomorrow.
10345224	10348805	And F you to anyone whose name starts with a J, just because I can.
10349486	10349986	Oh, wait.
10350786	10352447	Jamie has an issue with that.
10353587	10354187	Fuck you.
10354347	10354827	Who was that?
10355268	10355888	Llama Juice.
10356448	10356888	Fuck you.
10357668	10358209	Oh, yeah.
10358349	10359109	Llama Juice.
10360360	10363501	Oh yeah, and F you to anyone who can't pronounce my name correctly.
10363901	10365982	Leama Juice, WTF.
10366442	10367702	Leama Juice.
10371763	10379565	Okay, if you name yourself after an animal, a butt ugly one at that, expect to have the name pronounced like damn animals is.
10380426	10382686	Ooh, Jamie's on the warpath now after the J comment.
10383487	10388268	DarkLionXVI says, F you to the gangster that hit my cousin in the head with a hammer four times.
10388448	10388608	Ouch.
10389821	10393083	Though my cousin's fine, he suffered a big lump and several stitches.
10393583	10396165	I want those bastards responsible to be dead in front of me.
10396525	10396685	Ouch.
10397185	10400407	Either that hammer was too small or that gangsta wasn't swinging very hard.
10401027	10401347	You know what?
10401388	10404009	Somebody was just trying to imitate Donkey Kong where they had...
10409524	10412386	DarkLionXVI says, F you to the right side of my body.
10412746	10417970	Whenever I play 2DX and the note pattern dominates the right hand side, my right arm gets numb.
10419451	10420832	I just hope it's not a stroke.
10422490	10432517	I completely know what you mean, because you know, when I'm masturbating vigorously, you know, my rights, I get numbed too sometimes, so it's totally understandable.
10432557	10435659	I knew as soon as somebody said stroke, there was going to be a joke.
10439741	10444424	Alright, Angel says, F you to me feeling like shit, Tearsniff.
10444804	10448967	You'll notice she's not here tonight, that's because she is giving an F you because she feels like shit.
10453223	10454504	Yeah.
10454564	10454884	Moving on.
10457105	10465590	Flareone says, F you to Roanert Park, Scandia, for getting Madden Football as their token one new game every six months arcade game.
10466111	10469553	Also, fuck them for hypnotizing me into losing my keys there last night.
10472298	10477561	StepItOff, 1215, says, F you to all the good games coming out at the same time so I can't afford them.
10477941	10482923	And F you to the people who don't show up for Outside the Box, but I appreciate what Sky did on Thursday because the chat was great.
10483203	10483564	Thank you.
10485064	10487906	DJ Ranma S says, F you to Million Dollar Baby, yo.
10487986	10491348	Explain to me how the fuck does a movie that barely anyone heard of win?
10491428	10492308	Someone pass me a 40.
10494869	10497171	And lastly, SSJ100Matt,
10498615	10502959	says F you the week to me, to Skype, for playing the tub girl theme.
10503099	10506001	I mean, Christina Aguilera's dirty on Thursday's show.
10506622	10507102	Long story.
10508804	10513488	And also an F you to Scorsese being screwed over for the Best Director Oscar.
10517331	10519072	He got screwed so he gets an F you?
10520493	10520934	I don't know.
10521354	10522975	He doesn't get an F you for being a jerk.
10524297	10525958	You know we're going to hear about this for months.
10528757	10531099	It'll be on entertainment tonight, all night long.
10531299	10531820	Tomorrow night.
10531840	10537845	Seriously, you'll go to a news site and it'll be like, Scorsese fucks for the Oscars.
10537945	10542348	You know what I heard today from my sister?
10542669	10547993	She's telling me that there's a show that's called Celebrities Without Makeup.
10549114	10552977	It's played after American Idol and it's just ugly ass celebrities.
10553317	10557681	There was a big post It premiered on Thursday It was ugly.
10559586	10560566	The Simpsons The Simpsons
10584244	10586625	Well, American Idol is their top-rated program.
10586665	10587285	You gotta give them that.
10587305	10588285	Well, yeah, but come on, man.
10588545	10590026	What's Fox's show?
10591246	10591667	Like, what?
10591927	10593787	It's on season, like, 3,406?
10594127	10598429	It's been going a while.
10598649	10601110	In the next episode, Homer becomes a psycho killer.
10601130	10604791	Fox didn't have Seinfeld.
10604811	10606332	That was NBC.
10606672	10607272	What's her name?
10607352	10609653	Patsy is a lesbian on it now.
10609673	10610233	No, Patty is a lesbian.
10610253	10610613	Patty.
10610813	10611053	Whatever.
10611073	10611553	Patsy, Patty, same thing.
10611573	10613054	Yeah, it's like, who the hell didn't see that coming?
10615589	10617530	So when did they get their AIDS character?
10618430	10619431	Like Sesame Street.
10621432	10622372	Like Sesame Street?
10623033	10631076	That was Sesame Street, Africa that had the character because a lot of folks in that region where that Sesame Street was, it's a very real problem they have there.
10632717	10634318	Hey, what do you think got Mr. Hooper?
10635538	10640221	All those, you know, monkey lovers out there.
10640281	10641641	What is Grover anyway?
10643102	10643722	I don't know.
10643862	10644843	He's adorable.
10646570	10647130	No, he's not.
10647150	10648851	He's a fucking, like... Near?
10649191	10652353	No, because... He's an illegal immigrant is what he is.
10652713	10653773	From where?
10654394	10656134	They're all fucking hiding in the alleys.
10657355	10658776	Okay.
10660276	10661757	They all live in Oscar's trash can.
10661917	10662797	Because you know what?
10662958	10664518	You know that market that's on the street?
10664578	10665299	It's a big front.
10665319	10668360	It's a big, you know, fucking heroin and all sorts of drugs.
10668420	10670861	If I had an illegal immigrant living in my house, I'd be a grouch, too.
10672102	10673122	And Snuffleupagus?
10673422	10674703	Man, what a pot fiend.
10676163	10678405	And what about Big Bert?
10680267	10680868	Total queer.
10683591	10684992	Well, we already know about Bert and Ernie.
10685553	10686314	And Bert is evil.
10688115	10690498	I am so mad that the Bert is evil side is gone.
10691018	10691599	It's gone?
10691699	10692400	What happened to it?
10693323	10694964	It's been gone for some time.
10695004	10697704	I think someone mirrored it, but the original site's gone.
10698185	10700465	Did PBS slam the Iron Fist of Justice on their ass?
10700485	10701706	It was only up for like 600 years, probably.
10701766	10703486	I don't know, but... Oh, how sad.
10703706	10706767	The Children's Television Workshop got medieval on their ass.
10707828	10708228	All right.
10708688	10712409	One more story for you guys, and then it's about time to start calling it a show.
10713330	10717171	Red Octane, the group that creates the Ignition Pad.
10717191	10719031	Come to the GameStop Walmart.
10719052	10720392	We've got millions of them.
10721730	10725113	They're going to be publishing video games for the PlayStation 2.
10726514	10733559	Interesting, because Red Octane, to this point, has always been like a distributor, a pad maker, and they've never really made games.
10734779	10735880	Not that kind of pad maker.
10737141	10738502	Wow, they've never made games.
10738682	10740564	I'm sure their games are just going to rock.
10741124	10744587	They're going to be awesome, because they have so much experience in making games.
10744727	10746188	Oh wait, no they don't!
10746368	10748790	Well, they're not actually making the game, they're just going to distribute it.
10748810	10750671	They're going to be publishing the software.
10751718	10755940	The first title for the PlayStation 2 computer entertainment system will be announced in spring of 2005.
10756360	10765924	Kai Huang, president of Red Octane, says, Launching into a new business segment with the publishing of video games is a natural evolution for us.
10766324	10773727	We are committed to delivering the same high quality and fun found in our peripherals with the upcoming Red Octane software line.
10774827	10779249	So everybody, buy Red Octane accessories now, because they're going out of business.
10781829	10791257	Well, you know, you can look at this as a good thing or a bad thing.
10791797	10795701	Are there any, like, great dancing franchises or something that happen from over here?
10796701	10797442	I smell something.
10797462	10802206	I smell a distributor for In the Groove.
10803387	10806990	I was just about to say, wouldn't that be hilarious if the title they end up announcing is In the Groove?
10807566	10810767	Oh my god, Bomani Scene would not shut up for months.
10811047	10812208	They would not shut up.
10812688	10816989	You could shoot them in the face and they would not shut up about this.
10817850	10819070	If that's what they end up publishing.
10819090	10822431	Didn't someone just recently announce that they're doing a Pump It Up mix over here too?
10822611	10822851	Yes.
10824292	10824912	Who's doing that?
10826533	10827033	I don't know.
10827953	10829314	Mastiff, who did...
10830424	10831684	Well, Mastiff designed the game.
10831704	10832145	Designed?
10832185	10833545	I think Anna Mero's going to put it out.
10834025	10834245	Who?
10834445	10836286	I don't... Ah, do we have it on the site?
10836306	10836846	I don't remember.
10836866	10837566	Anna Mero did pump it up.
10837906	10839447	Yeah, Anna Mero did pump it up originally.
10839667	10840927	Who would release it in the States?
10841888	10843748	Well, Mastiff's going to design it.
10843888	10846829	Mastiff did something else pretty cool recently, I think.
10847849	10848330	Anna Mero.
10848350	10849710	All right.
10851442	10854044	I thought that would be a natural fit for a Red Octane distributor.
10854064	10856685	Well, that would be good, because then Red Octane can make a whole new pump-it-up pad, too.
10856705	10857426	That would certainly be interesting.
10857446	10861508	But unless they have something real popular, Home DDR still sells real well.
10861708	10866771	I mean, I don't know if anyone here really cares, but... Yeah, how does this... You actually work... Home DDR sells real well.
10866991	10867091	Yeah.
10867111	10868652	You sell lots of copies.
10868852	10869113	Mm-hmm.
10870053	10871734	Why won't people buy fucking ignition pads?
10871774	10872194	I don't know.
10873295	10875076	But, uh... But you sell the $20 pads, no problem.
10875096	10876977	Home DDR... Oh, fucking tons of them.
10877618	10879859	Because people come back three or four times, like, buy one good one.
10880019	10880860	No.
10881080	10881160	Um...
10882597	10884399	Although no one buys MC Grooves.
10886040	10893648	So it's like, they're going to release some sort of game, and it's just going to get smoked.
10894889	10896331	And then Red Octane is going to go out of business.
10897652	10898993	So get your ignition pads now.
10899274	10900175	I won't have them forever.
10900395	10903278	Someone's going to buy those pads, or I'm going to find someone to take them off my hands.
10903518	10906541	If Red Octane was publishing in the groove...
10907515	10912760	Doesn't Red Octane have, like, Konami's official blessing to be their pad distributor or something like that?
10913260	10913660	No.
10914601	10922408	They're not a licensed pad, but Konami has, I guess, what, didn't Jason Enos say that it's the best pad you can get?
10922908	10925671	Pretty much, because Konami doesn't really do their own pads anymore.
10925711	10928914	They did them, like, once in a great-ass while.
10929554	10934979	I've gone right up to Konami, and I've gone up to Namco when I go to trade shows, and I go to manager conferences, and I say, Hey!
10936041	10938364	Why the hell can't we get more Konami brand dancepads?
10939065	10941368	And they go, well, because Konami makes games.
10941428	10943470	We're not a peripheral manufacturer.
10943830	10946113	We make enough to promote the sales of the game.
10947435	10949197	And then we let the third parties take over.
10949417	10950579	Let's talk to Konami style.
10951360	10957382	Well, I'm just saying, if it ends up being that it is in the groove, because, you know, it's just kind of the pieces of the puzzle fit together.
10957682	10960323	Hmm, Red Octane announces they're going to publish a game.
10960663	10964325	Hmm, in the groove says they want to do a home version, but is looking for a publisher.
10964625	10965485	Hmm, hmm.
10965965	10972027	If it all ends up adding together, it would be very interesting to see what that effect has on Red Octane's relationship with Konami.
10972067	10972708	It won't matter.
10973428	10973688	Really?
10973948	10974168	Yeah.
10974688	10979470	Because, again, Red Octane does not operate with the explicit...
10981030	10982291	They don't license Konami.
10982311	10988175	That's why the red octane pad doesn't look just like what you'd think a Konami pad would look like.
10988195	10989015	It looks real similar.
10989155	10989416	Right.
10989776	10990536	But it looks different.
10992338	10993699	It's a totally different sort of thing.
10994059	11002324	Just because Konami says, yeah, these pads don't suck, wouldn't it suck if the official Konami manufacturer was Mad Catz?
11004266	11005046	That would be true.
11005186	11010730	Konami's going to say, hey, look, you can get dance pads from any of these companies out there because it saves them having to make them.
11011829	11013570	But it still lets their products sell.
11014791	11018413	So they may as well say that somebody's the best, and apparently that was Red Octane.
11020594	11029619	Well, it'll just be interesting to see how things heat up when In The Groove does possibly find the publisher.
11030039	11031479	Does In The Groove use a different pad layout?
11031560	11032800	No, it's the same pad layout.
11033441	11034601	Then why would it be?
11034881	11036582	Because it's competition for Konami.
11036742	11037923	It's not competition for Konami.
11040401	11045624	It's like if I went out and I made a flip cartoon and tried to put it up against, you know, the Incredibles.
11047865	11048706	I'd get crushed.
11049386	11050187	Crushed.
11050727	11052348	Well, I mean, we'll see what happens.
11052388	11052968	We'll see what happens.
11053668	11053869	Yeah.
11054189	11054429	All right.
11054489	11055469	Anyway, we got to wrap it up, though.
11055509	11058791	We got to go around and get everybody's final thoughts because it's time to wrap up the show.
11058971	11059852	Dan, your final thought.
11060592	11061853	Red Oxen Edition pads.
11062273	11063574	GameStop on Marconi.
11064514	11065135	Come and get them.
11066455	11067656	Loki, your final thought.
11070714	11072435	Go outside.
11073095	11074456	Except if it's GameStop.
11074496	11077857	If it's GameStop, invite the red octane ignition pads.
11078818	11080298	Because, you know what?
11081799	11082279	You need them.
11082999	11083740	You need to buy them.
11084300	11085420	Plus, they're comfy to sit on.
11088302	11091443	My final thought is, um, I want a beer.
11097141	11101724	I want a beer to not spill on my new ignition pad that I bought for the GameStop on Marconi.
11103105	11103866	Jamie, your final thought.
11105367	11106228	Ouch.
11108149	11109970	I need an ignition pad for my pain.
11110031	11112592	From GameStop.
11112973	11113493	From GameStop.
11113553	11113974	On Marconi.
11114134	11115174	On Marconi and Fulton.
11115455	11115875	Alright.
11116616	11117937	Final word of the show.
11118537	11121739	One word and one word only to wrap it all up.
11121840	11123801	Sum up tonight's show in one word.
11124382	11125562	You know I gotta give it to Dan.
11125923	11126223	Dan?
11126243	11126303	Dan?
11126670	11128090	What is tonight's final word?
