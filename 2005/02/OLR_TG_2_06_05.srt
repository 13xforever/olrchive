Your internet radio home for discussion on rhythm and music gaming, and all the news on video games that don't suck.

And now, here are your hosts, DarkSakura, Skye, and Loki.

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Hello again everybody, and welcome back to our podcast!

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Thanks a bunch for subscribing.

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:33,240
My name is Rob Roberts, you might know me as Sky. Joining me as always, awesome co-hosts, we love them,

8
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:41,240
say hello to Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers. Hi. Hi. How are you? I'm not gonna do it. Save it for the

9
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:47,320
three hour show. All right. www.orangelaunchradio.com, by the way, we're a part of that website,

10
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:51,080
we could do a three hour show every Sunday night over there. It's tons of fun, and then we have all

11
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:56,360
the spin-off programming too. But the podcast is something else we bring to you, to talk about

12
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:58,960
video games that don't suck.

13
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:02,000
And here's another host that doesn't suck, Loki!

14
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Hi.

15
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Hello.

16
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,780
Um, hope you guys enjoyed the Super Bowl, or as we call it, the Stupid Bowl, or as one

17
00:01:08,780 --> 00:01:11,840
of our listeners called it on Sunday Night Show, the Super Bowl.

18
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:14,440
That was pretty great.

19
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:18,080
You know what, nothing against you guys that are into the Super Bowl, but it's just not

20
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:19,640
for us, really.

21
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:24,600
And you know what, neither are really football-based video games, or basketball games, or any of

22
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:25,600
that stuff.

23
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:30,040
sports video games that you find that you actually enjoy Dark Sakura?

24
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:31,440
Tecmo Bowl.

25
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:33,680
Tecmo Bowl for NES, absolutely.

26
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:37,720
And High Impact for SNES.

27
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:42,680
My favorites would probably be two old school 8-bit Nintendo games,

28
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:45,600
Ice Hockey and Blades of Steel.

29
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:47,600
I went through this whole hockey phase.

30
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:52,440
Actually, I was kind of impressed with the ESPN game that came out on Xbox.

31
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:54,080
Because it's pretty...

32
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:55,760
It looks like you're watching TV.

33
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:56,760
It's pretty.

34
00:01:56,760 --> 00:02:00,560
I don't know, I just, I feel like, I think we've talked about this on the three hour

35
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:05,080
show before, but to play a sports game, I feel like I should be outside actually playing

36
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:06,440
the sport.

37
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:07,440
That's just me though.

38
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:10,480
I like sports entertainment games, like Raw and SmackDown.

39
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:12,440
Yeah, cause that's stuff I would do.

40
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:13,440
Just for the creative wrestler.

41
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:14,440
Cause I'm a big baby.

42
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:15,680
Cause we made the Macho Man.

43
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:17,640
Loki, your thoughts on sports games?

44
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:23,900
I don't play sports games, unless you consider, you know, BMX XXX a sports game.

45
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:24,900
Why not?

46
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:26,340
They just don't do it for me.

47
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:31,460
I don't like watching sports normally, and I don't like playing sports games.

48
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:33,380
I just dislike sports.

49
00:02:33,380 --> 00:02:34,380
I don't know.

50
00:02:34,380 --> 00:02:38,380
Well, if you guys want to talk about sports games, there's some other podcasts out there

51
00:02:38,380 --> 00:02:39,380
where they do talk about it.

52
00:02:39,380 --> 00:02:42,060
Now, if there's anything wrong with that, just not our cup of tea.

53
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:44,820
We want to talk about other types of video games.

54
00:02:44,820 --> 00:02:46,980
For instance, the games we've been playing this week.

55
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:49,780
Jamie, what kind of games have you been playing this week?

56
00:02:49,780 --> 00:02:50,780
Guitar Freaks.

57
00:02:50,780 --> 00:02:51,780
Ah, yes.

58
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:55,380
I yes we broke it back and I played some poppin nine

59
00:02:55,380 --> 00:02:59,340
oh you've had quite a bimani filled week a music gaming week haven't you a couple

60
00:02:59,340 --> 00:02:59,800
days

61
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:03,360
yeah every time I go home Dan's either playing

62
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:08,160
well he's now playing snake eater I thought he beat Metal Gear

63
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:11,220
solid three no no yeah he didn't bother home

64
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:14,300
bass playing that now but I've been coming home to playing

65
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:17,420
a guitar freaks it's been funny isn't so cute

66
00:03:17,420 --> 00:03:20,540
so but but at least it's both Konami games

67
00:03:20,540 --> 00:03:26,240
And then you go from like US Konami to Japanese Konami and I don't know and then I was playing

68
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:33,760
Of course, it's so it's so weird to hear you talk about playing Final Fantasy 11. That was me and Loki's thing. I

69
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,240
Don't play it that much like an hour a day

70
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:45,800
All right, whatever school that's how it starts. That's how it starts. I have a life me, too

71
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:49,120
I go to school and the gym and I work I

72
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:58,680
I work and I drink you exercise your liquor I do you know what I work out I

73
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:02,120
pick up that heavy bottle of liquor and I pick it up and bring it towards my

74
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:05,120
mouth it's a little fleck forget it who am I trying to kid

75
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:11,120
look you would even playing this week other than Final Fantasy not really much

76
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:17,400
I played some flash games last night that were weird kind of came over the

77
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:21,000
website it was just um like they had one it was drunken walk where you had to

78
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:25,520
like make sure your characters balanced otherwise he falls over and passes out

79
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:31,400
there was another one that was called wheel and it was like it was some weird

80
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:34,240
flash games there's a lot of really interesting stuff out there that people

81
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:40,280
make and there's just a lot of fun so mainly that stuff mostly Final Fantasy

82
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:45,960
though alright as far as the games I've been playing this week a DDR angel who's

83
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:50,280
a common guest we have on the Sunday show. She's heard me constantly bitching about no

84
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:56,240
good games out on DS right now. So she decided to bring over Mr. Driller on the DS so I could

85
00:04:56,240 --> 00:05:00,620
check it out because she's like, hey, there's this new game. And I played it a little bit

86
00:05:00,620 --> 00:05:03,900
before like maybe for like five minutes, but I didn't really get to play it a little more

87
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:11,840
in depth until earlier. And it's kind of neat. I like it. You know, it's the same Mr. Driller

88
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:15,340
game. There's really not a whole lot that the DS adds to it. It's just like, oh, it's

89
00:05:15,340 --> 00:05:20,140
another freaking mr. driller game but mr. driller is kind of one of those games

90
00:05:20,140 --> 00:05:23,980
where like I really want to get good at it because I like puzzle games a lot

91
00:05:23,980 --> 00:05:29,100
like some of my favorite games or puzzle games like Tetris super puzzle fighter

92
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:33,940
2 turbo and all that I want to be good at mr. driller but the strategy isn't

93
00:05:33,940 --> 00:05:37,940
clicking for me like I can't figure out how to get good at that game I just I

94
00:05:37,940 --> 00:05:42,420
keep hammering I want to drill down as fast as possible because I think that's

95
00:05:42,420 --> 00:05:45,820
way to do it but it's you have to think about where the bricks are gonna fall

96
00:05:45,820 --> 00:05:52,020
and my brain isn't developed yet it's too tough but yeah mr. driller DS it's

97
00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:56,180
just freaking mr. driller but I guess one cool thing about it is it's got the

98
00:05:56,180 --> 00:05:59,780
whole you know wireless multiplayer thing so it's kind of neat kind of nice

99
00:05:59,780 --> 00:06:03,860
to see DS's do that who was telling me about the DS picked oh chat thing that's

100
00:06:03,860 --> 00:06:06,980
being developed I hadn't read anything on that Loki or yours mentioning

101
00:06:06,980 --> 00:06:10,420
something about this what did you read well it's not really a picked oh chat

102
00:06:10,420 --> 00:06:17,180
thing. It's some, um, god I can't remember which game it is. There's a game coming out

103
00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:21,720
where, while you're playing the game, I think it's even like a puzzle game or something

104
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:26,060
like that, where you're playing the game and there'll be a little icon or whatever that'll

105
00:06:26,060 --> 00:06:31,960
come up if someone's within distance of you that's in PictoChat and you can quit out your

106
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:38,800
game to go to PictoChat or use, you know, invite them into a multiplayer game. So it

107
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:42,640
it was kind of neat and I wished that they would add that to, you know, future games

108
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:47,120
because it's really something that's lacking. I mean, I think it'd be cool, like, what they

109
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:54,440
should do is, like, with Xbox online, where you can see, or Xbox Live, where you can see

110
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:57,800
who's online, what game they're playing, that type of thing. They should have that when

111
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:00,800
you're walking around the DS, where it's just like, okay, this person's playing this game,

112
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:04,240
oh, this person's in PictoChat, you know, that kind of thing. And you can, like, send

113
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:08,740
little PMs to them or whatever to say, hey, you know, come chat with me or hey, I want

114
00:07:08,740 --> 00:07:11,120
to play a multiplayer game with you or something like that.

115
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:13,840
That's what they need.

116
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:19,220
I absolutely agree the DS needed something like this from the start and a lot of Xbox

117
00:07:19,220 --> 00:07:22,720
Live games when Xbox Live was first out didn't have this either and they really needed it

118
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:28,320
because you know, I want to know if certain people around are playing the DS, who's in

119
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:32,820
PictoChat, what room, it's like when they first advertise the DS, do you remember that

120
00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:36,600
movie they were showing at E3 and they showed like the kid was reading a book

121
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:39,800
upstairs and the mom was sending a message on PictoChat saying like come

122
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:45,120
down to dinner well how would the kid ever know that if your DS is off you're

123
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:48,440
not in PictoChat the thing doesn't beep to let you know somebody's trying to

124
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:51,920
send you a PictoChat message or anything like that it's like the system now

125
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:57,040
granted when you see things at E3 it's stuff that's in development so you know

126
00:07:57,040 --> 00:08:00,520
maybe that thing hadn't been finalized or whatever but at least it needs

127
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:04,640
something where I think you were saying this to me early at least it could show

128
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:08,480
you like who around you if people are playing DS's around you like when you if

129
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:11,420
you look at the webcam for one of our Sunday night shows here we do an orange

130
00:08:11,420 --> 00:08:14,640
on radio there's usually five people here in studio all playing DS's there

131
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:19,000
should be a way to see what game each person around you's playing honestly ds

132
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:24,080
needs something like that so possibly though something that will be coming out

133
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:28,060
later something that they might have at e3 who knows I mean I'm sure they haven't

134
00:08:28,060 --> 00:08:33,260
you know they might have you know overlooked it early on but definitely not

135
00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:35,900
overlooked it completely I'm sure there's something out there maybe

136
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:42,300
there's a reason why they couldn't do that I don't know we shall see all right

137
00:08:42,300 --> 00:08:46,060
I want to talk about some gaming news going on we got a launch date for PSP in

138
00:08:46,060 --> 00:08:53,020
North America it's gonna launch March 24th guess how much it's gonna cost 250

139
00:08:53,020 --> 00:08:57,340
or as they would have you want to know 249 of course that doesn't figure in the

140
00:08:57,340 --> 00:09:01,420
so you really are gonna be paying 250 plus for this and it's gonna come with a

141
00:09:01,420 --> 00:09:08,660
32 megabyte memory stick including oh there will be 24 games that are

142
00:09:08,660 --> 00:09:12,900
confirmed for the launch which is probably more games than the DS has out

143
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:16,940
now so that's one that's one thing the PSP is gonna have going out the gate so

144
00:09:16,940 --> 00:09:23,740
if I were Nintendo I'd be a little worried right now but PSP has a firm

145
00:09:23,740 --> 00:09:29,620
date set now here's the interesting thing there may be another I think or

146
00:09:29,620 --> 00:09:35,160
what was this deal here it's um okay I'm sorry also in the pack headphones with a

147
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:41,520
remote control battery pack AC adapter case cleaning cloth game demo so you're

148
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:46,180
not getting any actual games that are plugged in but if you're one of the

149
00:09:46,180 --> 00:09:52,760
first million people to buy a PSP you get a free copy of spider-man 2 the

150
00:09:52,760 --> 00:10:00,480
movie just for your PSP on UMD format of course. So you have a copy of Spider-Man 2 to take

151
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:05,020
with you everywhere you go as if you didn't know in the movie on DVD already. I mean talk

152
00:10:05,020 --> 00:10:11,000
about a horde movie. I mean you can get Spider-Man 2 in the checkout lane at the grocery store.

153
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:15,940
That's how like everywhere this movie is and of course it's a huge movie. It's a very audience

154
00:10:15,940 --> 00:10:20,680
friendly movie. I like the movie. A lot of people like the movie but damn talk about

155
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:24,840
over saturation I don't know if that's you know that doesn't make me that

156
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:28,400
excited to be one of the first million people is like ooh I can have spider-man

157
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:35,240
2 again in my pocket to watch again I'm just wondering if they fixed the

158
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:39,920
amazing game launcher function I mentioned this one more time for our

159
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:43,840
listeners the game launcher function where if you twist it your game shoots

160
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:53,880
out so you can hold up a bank with the game launcher really no Rob okay maybe

161
00:10:53,880 --> 00:11:01,560
not now one of the things that I have to laugh about this is the memory stick

162
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:09,480
thing with that I'm sure people are gonna have Linux on this in no time

163
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:13,480
people will install Linux in a shoe box

164
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:18,080
anything with a monitor they will try to install Linux on did we talk about this

165
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:21,160
last week I don't remember what show was we talked about Linux being installed on

166
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:22,040
the iPod

167
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:25,280
and I'm just like they will install Linux on anything

168
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:29,080
anything called Linux on an iPod I have seen

169
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:32,480
they're working on Linux on the DS right now honestly

170
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:35,680
I kid you not it's so

171
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:46,960
crazy do they have Linux on Commodore 64 that rocks that's so rocks all right

172
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:50,840
quick gaming no I want to get to dark sacros advice column for the week I want

173
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:54,200
to give a quick gaming you know this is a series I played for a little bit I

174
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:57,640
didn't finish this game though but it was a it was a good game it kind of felt

175
00:11:57,640 --> 00:11:59,920
like watching a movie sometimes though I didn't have a lot of control over the

176
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:06,920
Zeno Saga, it's getting a sequel. It came out a while ago, it came out, it felt like it came out quite a while ago.

177
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:17,920
It's just now getting a sequel, February 15th, very soon, Zeno Saga Part 2, developed by Monolith Soft, same studio that did Episode 1.

178
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:25,920
And Zeno Saga 2 will have more than 100 skills for characters, including Last Revenge, Overload, Double Power.

179
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:29,880
new to the battle system are double attacks and that would be like a team-up mode where

180
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:35,760
you do a team-up and you do one big assault so Xenosaga 2. Anybody, did you ever play

181
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:40,320
the Xenosaga games at all Jamie? No. You didn't just really get into the series? No. I thought

182
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:46,080
you were the one that turned, I know one of my old, that was, one of my old buddies made

183
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:48,520
me play it, actually play it, but I thought you were the one that first told me about

184
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:53,560
it. That was Miklotov, who was into Xenosaga 2. Maybe, I don't know. I don't know where

185
00:12:53,560 --> 00:13:00,320
I did remember, however, the hint to the existence of Xenogears in Final Fantasy 7, when Cloud's

186
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:10,320
in the hospital, and he's mumbling incoherently, and he says, Xenogias, Z-E-N-O dot dot dot,

187
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:11,320
G-I-A-S.

188
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:16,880
All sorts of little inside jokes in those Squeenix games.

189
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:21,220
Alright, um, we here at Orange Honors Radio, not only do we want to make your lives, I'm

190
00:13:21,220 --> 00:13:25,120
sorry, not only do we want to talk about what's going on in the video game world, but we want

191
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:26,840
to make your lives better.

192
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:32,320
Therefore, the usually angsty Dark Sacra has her little advice column for you guys, and

193
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:36,760
we call it Dark Sacra's Advice Column.

194
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:40,160
Jamie, what did you bring for us this week?

195
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:44,080
Today's bit of advice is how to win a bar fight.

196
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:50,320
State laws stipulate that you may use sufficient force to stop an attack, but you may not deliver

197
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:53,760
any sort of punitive retribution to your attacker.

198
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:56,320
Remembering this may save you a costly trip to the court.

199
00:13:56,320 --> 00:14:00,720
Basically, in English, you can stop someone from attacking you but can't budge them back.

200
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:01,720
Aww.

201
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:02,720
Can't get your pay back.

202
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:03,720
Where's the fun in that bar fight?

203
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:05,200
Eh, this is just how to win.

204
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:06,560
What about breaking a bottle on their head?

205
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:07,560
Does that count?

206
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:11,840
If it's enough to stop them from hitting you again, sure.

207
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:15,520
Anyway, here's four easy steps to win a bar fight.

208
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:19,200
Number one, attack the most sensitive areas of your opponent.

209
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:21,200
Eyes, groin, knee, and throat.

210
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:22,120
Stay close.

211
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:25,460
If your opponent is large, he will need room to hit you.

212
00:14:25,460 --> 00:14:28,520
Two, attack repeatedly and be efficient.

213
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:32,320
Make fast, repeated blows to any or all sensitive areas.

214
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:36,280
I want a nice, clean, efficient bar fight.

215
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:40,080
That means kicking the balls repeatedly.

216
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:41,240
Repeatedly.

217
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:42,560
Just repeatedly punch the groin.

218
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:43,680
Number three.

219
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:45,960
If necessary, use a weapon.

220
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:49,600
Choices include telephones, pens, bottles, books, beer

221
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:52,560
mugs, coffee cups, and keys.

222
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:53,760
Four.

223
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:55,640
Protect yourself from additional attackers

224
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:57,520
by fighting with your back too, but not up

225
00:14:57,520 --> 00:15:00,480
against a corner or a wall.

226
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:02,160
Very interesting.

227
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:04,640
I also have a little bit more to add to that.

228
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:05,160
OK.

229
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:07,120
It's a move that they taught us in my karate class.

230
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:07,400
OK.

231
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:09,480
If you happen to be picked up and have the ever-loving chick

232
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:12,820
squeezed out of you all you have to do is get your hands free and hit them on

233
00:15:12,820 --> 00:15:17,260
the side of the head with your palm I would demonstrate but our listeners

234
00:15:17,260 --> 00:15:20,120
will not see that kind of like how when you do something stupid your mom smacks

235
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:23,320
you upside the head and goes what were you thinking oh no it's more of like a

236
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:28,320
tank like with both hands both hands on the side because it will disorient them

237
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:34,140
oh very interesting thought thank you Jamie for helping to better our lives so

238
00:15:34,140 --> 00:15:38,240
yes next next next time you're in a bar fight you'll win that way next time you

239
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:43,200
you guys go to the bar and you get in that argument, DSPSP, DSPSP, and then it erupts

240
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:45,680
into a fight, now you know, kicking the groin repeatedly.

241
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:48,300
Gouge out the eyes. Exactly.

242
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:55,460
Make sure that you hit people with your elbow. Let's talk about gaming and movies. Don't

243
00:15:55,460 --> 00:16:01,240
we love it when video games cross over and become movies? Okay, maybe not, but it doesn't

244
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:07,760
stop it from happening. Guess what game's coming next? Of course, you knew this was

245
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:12,640
gonna happen variety is reporting that Microsoft has quietly put the finishing

246
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:17,600
touches on a million-dollar deal with the guy that wrote the movie 28 days

247
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:26,940
later to adapt halo the movie oh first of all now I like 28 days later that was

248
00:16:26,940 --> 00:16:31,760
a good movie I don't know it was a good zombie movie weird ending but you know

249
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:35,240
It was a good movie.

250
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:36,240
We...

251
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:38,980
Halo movie.

252
00:16:38,980 --> 00:16:41,520
We better not see what the Master Chief looks like.

253
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:43,680
28 Days Later, a good zombie movie.

254
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:45,560
Evil Dead, a good zombie movie.

255
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:47,040
28 Days Later...

256
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:50,780
What the hell was that?

257
00:16:50,780 --> 00:16:52,640
That was more like what it is.

258
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:59,520
It's like, you know, we want to kind of do a Dawn of the Dead, but not quite Dawn of

259
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:00,960
the Dead.

260
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:03,640
make them run because that's a little different you know they don't normally

261
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:13,160
run and then we'll just go ahead and make a really shitty ending here's the

262
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:16,760
weird thing about Halo is that in many aspects it already is a movie so I don't

263
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:20,760
kind of understand the but of course a lot of the Resident Evil games had a

264
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:23,520
very movie feel to them and they made a game they made a movie out of that

265
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:28,840
anyway but I mean yeah I mean they made two movies out of Resident Evil but the

266
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:34,840
The only movie that should ever be made, and I'm sure Jamie's gonna agree with me on this,

267
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:36,440
is Red vs. Blue the movie.

268
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:37,440
Yes!

269
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:38,440
We need Red vs. Blue the movie.

270
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:43,100
That is the only way that this movie will be any good, because Red vs. Blue, they could

271
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:47,460
honestly put that on TV, and that would be entertaining.

272
00:17:47,460 --> 00:17:52,360
I was gonna say Castlevania the movie, which we've been bitching about for years, and no,

273
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:54,720
Van Helsing was not Castlevania the movie.

274
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:55,720
I'm sorry.

275
00:17:55,720 --> 00:18:01,000
needs to be like Dracula X version anyway I want to mention this though

276
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:05,440
because Microsoft thinks that they've learned from mistakes like Resident Evil

277
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:09,680
Apocalypse and Alone in the Dark which were hated by critics this is what

278
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:14,200
they've decided here what they're gonna do they're going to develop their own

279
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:18,560
script and then shop it to studios once it's satisfied so Microsoft's developing

280
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:24,760
this script internally so could that be good we'll see I think that that's good

281
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:29,760
because at least then it will stay Halo and not like Hollywood Halo.

282
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:33,760
Well, it's easy not to fuck up their movie. Don't get into that one guy that made those three movies.

283
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:39,760
I mean, you know, he's the one that's, you know, crapping out these really shitty scripts.

284
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:42,760
Actually, I believe Resident Evil and Mortal Kombat were done by one guy,

285
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:47,760
and then Alone in the Dark and, um, House of the Dead were done by another guy.

286
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:53,760
Okay, House of the Dead, Alone in the Dark guy, that's the guy that should not touch any scripts for anything ever.

287
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:57,200
never ever ever touch anything okay

288
00:18:57,200 --> 00:19:01,040
it scares me enough that the guy that you know directed Catwoman

289
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:04,120
is going to be doing Akira that scares the shit out of me

290
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:07,560
yes he will be doing the live-action Akira what

291
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:11,280
yes so look forward to that piece of shit coming out

292
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:15,000
somewhere

293
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:19,560
inside I am crying and watch him fully base it off of the anime which would

294
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:23,400
absolutely suck they'd need to base it off of the manga for it to be any good

295
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:27,180
hear that I realize you kind of work in the industry a little bit so you pick up

296
00:19:27,180 --> 00:19:30,480
on things like that but where did you hear something like that it was on any

297
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:34,260
cool news like a while ago they have because they had a whole big thing about

298
00:19:34,260 --> 00:19:39,900
it and how they're like oh god why you know but I don't know don't get me wrong

299
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:43,740
I love ain't it cool news calm but I hope that's another one of their fake

300
00:19:43,740 --> 00:19:48,940
ass rumors I really do there are some other ones there was um oh god I want to

301
00:19:48,940 --> 00:19:55,220
say who was the James Cameron's gonna be picking up battle angel which is gonna

302
00:19:55,220 --> 00:20:00,020
be good now that would be good James Cameron doing that so I can see that

303
00:20:00,020 --> 00:20:05,220
happening pretty being pretty sweet of course you have the live-action a on

304
00:20:05,220 --> 00:20:10,220
flux movie coming out which should be pretty good I imagine I have issues with

305
00:20:10,220 --> 00:20:15,620
Charlize Theron though but I'll say that for another show anyway moving on

306
00:20:15,620 --> 00:20:18,180
Uh, speaking of movies, now let's go the other way.

307
00:20:18,180 --> 00:20:20,720
Let's talk about movies going into games.

308
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:22,580
This was a big story this week.

309
00:20:22,580 --> 00:20:29,100
EA is developing a game based on an old movie, The Godfather.

310
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:34,580
They're doing a Godfather game, and this made news this week because I believe Marlon Brando

311
00:20:34,580 --> 00:20:39,060
was quoted in an interview a long time ago, or somehow an article came up about him this

312
00:20:39,060 --> 00:20:40,060
week.

313
00:20:40,060 --> 00:20:44,360
No, he wasn't quoted, but somebody had said about him that he initially refused the part

314
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:51,720
he played in the movie The Godfather, he refused that because he felt that the movie glorified

315
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:58,520
the Mafia. And it turns out he actually has loaned his voice talents to this game. Yes,

316
00:20:58,520 --> 00:21:03,240
he's dead, he did it before he died. This game's been in production for quite some time.

317
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:08,520
Marlon Brando actually loaned his voice to the game. And what is this game going to be

318
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:14,280
doing? Glorifying the Mafia, you betcha. And I hear that he's going to be releasing a new

319
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:19,680
album with Tupac coming out later on cuz you know Elvis and Elvis yeah because

320
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:25,480
they make new music even after they're dead so anyways you're just thinking

321
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:32,560
well Robert Duvall and James Caan Robert Duvall and James Caan will also be

322
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:35,960
loaning their voices to this so that should be interesting and EA is gonna

323
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:41,320
have a big gala premiere of the Godfather February 10th and guess what

324
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:44,200
it's gonna be first shown to the public in the New York City neighborhood

325
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:50,240
of Little Italy. Isn't that cute? Alright, one more news story for you guys tonight.

326
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:55,800
I'm excited about this. I really am. I saved the best for last. Capcom is going to be doing

327
00:21:55,800 --> 00:22:01,100
a couple new compilations. And you know how they did the Mega Man anniversary collection

328
00:22:01,100 --> 00:22:05,240
last year, which was such a good idea. Oh, it was such a good idea. I was very pleased

329
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:08,640
with that game. Did you play the Mega Man compilation at all?

330
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:10,880
I did, but the timing was way off.

331
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:14,400
Did you play it on GameCube or PS2?

332
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:17,360
I think that we had Dan try it out on PS2.

333
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:17,860
Hm.

334
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:23,360
Because, on the NES, he can do, um, Quick Man's level without using the time stopper.

335
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:26,080
And, uh, he couldn't do it on the PS2.

336
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:28,240
But he came home and did it again on the NES.

337
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:29,200
Interesting.

338
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:30,740
Hm.

339
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:32,320
We'll see.

340
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:36,960
Um, but Mega Man, they're also going to be doing a Mega Man X collection,

341
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:39,960
because the Mega Man Anniversary Collection did so well, they're going to do a compilation

342
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:41,700
of all the Mega Man X games.

343
00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:43,440
This really shouldn't be a surprise to anyone.

344
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:46,720
I think this is kind of a foregone conclusion, but that's pretty cool.

345
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:50,640
They actually released this little trailer that just, they haven't said exactly what

346
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:54,560
games are going to be in it, but they did catch one unlockable that's going to be in

347
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:55,560
the game.

348
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:59,200
Mega Man Battle and Chase will be an unlockable that's in the Mega Man X.

349
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:00,200
That's pretty obscure.

350
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:01,200
That's cool.

351
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:04,160
Yeah, but I mean if you think about it, the two arcade games that they put in the Mega

352
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:10,460
collection to begin with were also pretty obscure. Where's Mega Man Soccer? I want that

353
00:23:10,460 --> 00:23:17,500
in a collection. What? You know what they need? Is fucking Mega Man Legends 3, okay?

354
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:22,100
I love those games. Even a Mega Man Legends online would be awesome, because that could

355
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:28,660
totally, you know, become an RPG, even though it was like all weird and everything. Capcom,

356
00:23:28,660 --> 00:23:34,100
Capcom, by the way, is also going to be developing a Capcom Classics collection, and it's going

357
00:23:34,100 --> 00:23:39,360
to be basically this compilation of classic games from Capcom.

358
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:43,380
They haven't said what games are going to be in it, but they're hinting that it will

359
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:49,940
include old school favorites, such as those that have been seen in the Capcom Generations

360
00:23:49,940 --> 00:23:53,940
compilations that were released in Japan for the Saturn and PlayStation.

361
00:23:53,940 --> 00:23:55,180
I actually have one of those.

362
00:23:55,180 --> 00:23:59,740
I have the Makai Mora set, which is Ghouls and Ghosts, Ghosts and Goblins.

363
00:23:59,740 --> 00:24:02,060
Ooh. See now, I think those are the kinds of things.

364
00:24:02,060 --> 00:24:05,660
And might I say, Capcom,

365
00:24:05,660 --> 00:24:09,460
pretty pretty pretty please, I have a couple requests.

366
00:24:09,460 --> 00:24:13,180
Bionic Commando. Strider.

367
00:24:13,180 --> 00:24:18,300
Magic Sword. Strider.

368
00:24:18,300 --> 00:24:21,100
And Quiz and Dragons. How cool would that be?

369
00:24:21,100 --> 00:24:24,420
Quiz and Dragons. Okay, I'm kidding on the last one.

370
00:24:24,420 --> 00:24:39,420
The thing about Strider is that they released it as part of the Strider 2, which is funny because they even made the changes, because we have the Japanese version and the US version because my fiance is a big Strider fiend.

371
00:24:39,420 --> 00:24:49,420
For any of our listeners who ever frequented any of the Strider sites, he actually had Neo Strider's own back in the day, which is one of the first ones out there.

372
00:24:49,420 --> 00:24:55,060
Wow. Um, but on the first one where he's swinging he sort of goes ha ha ha ha the

373
00:24:55,060 --> 00:24:59,900
whole time. He doesn't do that in the US one and they fully did the US one when they

374
00:24:59,900 --> 00:25:08,180
brought that out. We need, um, we need, uh, Captain Commando. Yes. We need Captain

375
00:25:08,180 --> 00:25:13,580
Commando. Yes we do. And we need the D&D games. And I want Super Slam Masters

376
00:25:13,580 --> 00:25:18,180
again. Super Slam. Well Captain Commando did come out on the PlayStation. It was

377
00:25:18,180 --> 00:25:23,700
3 player. I don't remember that coming out of the PlayStation. It did. I have it. It's

378
00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:28,300
awesome. Alright, we'll see. Oh, I have high hopes for this. I hope it's as good as those

379
00:25:28,300 --> 00:25:31,820
Midway collections. Seriously, those are some of the best collections I've played. And I

380
00:25:31,820 --> 00:25:36,320
hope it's not like the Nintendo collections where they put 20, I'm sorry, they put one

381
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:41,020
game and released it for 20 bucks on a Game Boy Advance cart. Especially when it's games

382
00:25:41,020 --> 00:25:46,180
that were unlockable in other games, i.e. Metroid. Shame. I mean, a couple of them were

383
00:25:46,180 --> 00:25:51,740
like Zelda was cool but seriously 20 bucks for Donkey Kong I don't think so

384
00:25:51,740 --> 00:25:56,020
that's not the way to do these compilations Midway knows how to do the

385
00:25:56,020 --> 00:25:59,700
compilations I hope Capcom takes the page out of their book as you could just

386
00:25:59,700 --> 00:26:03,340
play Animal Crossing get all those games that's like Animal Crossing it's like a

387
00:26:03,340 --> 00:26:09,860
$240 value or it's one way to think about it all right that's gonna do it

388
00:26:09,860 --> 00:26:14,340
for this podcast Jamie any parting words for our listeners parting words
