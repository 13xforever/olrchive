11
00:00:35,656 --> 00:00:35,937
Hi.

12
00:00:36,757 --> 00:00:36,997
Hi.

13
00:00:37,337 --> 00:00:37,637
[SPEAKER_02]: How are you?

14
00:00:39,138 --> 00:00:40,038
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not going to do it.

15
00:00:40,798 --> 00:00:41,959
[SPEAKER_02]: Save it for the three-hour show.

16
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:45,061
[SPEAKER_02]: www.orangeloungeradio.com

17
00:01:05,245 --> 00:01:05,845
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for watching!

18
00:01:27,990 --> 00:01:31,591
[SPEAKER_02]: Tecmo Bowl and High Impact for SNES Ice Hockey and Blades of Steel

19
00:01:52,313 --> 00:02:16,925
[SPEAKER_02]: because it's pretty it's pretty watching tv it's pretty i don't know i just i feel like a lot of it i think we've talked about this on the three-hour show before but to play a sports game i feel like i should be outside actually playing the sport that's just me though i like sports entertainment games like raw and smackdown yeah because that's stuff i would create a wrestler because i'm a big macho man loki your thoughts on sports games

20
00:02:18,095 --> 00:02:23,501
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't play sports games unless you consider, you know, BMX XXX a sports game.

21
00:02:23,861 --> 00:02:24,262
[SPEAKER_02]: Why not?

22
00:02:25,463 --> 00:02:26,344
[SPEAKER_02]: Just don't do it for me.

23
00:02:26,524 --> 00:02:30,729
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't like watching sports normally and I don't like playing sports games.

24
00:02:31,610 --> 00:02:32,932
[SPEAKER_02]: I just dislike sports.

25
00:02:33,492 --> 00:02:33,813
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

26
00:02:35,103 --> 00:02:39,384
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, if you guys want to talk about sports games, there's some other podcasts out there where they do talk about it.

27
00:02:39,424 --> 00:02:42,005
[SPEAKER_02]: Not that there's anything wrong with that, just, you know, not our cup of tea.

28
00:02:42,025 --> 00:02:44,185
[SPEAKER_02]: We want to talk about other types of video games.

29
00:02:44,785 --> 00:02:46,986
[SPEAKER_02]: For instance, the games we've been playing this week.

30
00:02:47,386 --> 00:02:48,746
[SPEAKER_02]: Jimmy, what kind of games have you been playing this week?

31
00:02:49,527 --> 00:02:50,307
[SPEAKER_03]: Guitar Freaks.

32
00:02:52,647 --> 00:02:52,987
[SPEAKER_02]: Ah, yes.

33
00:02:53,688 --> 00:02:54,328
[SPEAKER_03]: We broke it back down.

34
00:02:54,368 --> 00:02:55,028
[SPEAKER_03]: I played some Papa 9.

35
00:02:56,048 --> 00:02:58,949
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, you've had quite a Bomani-filled week, a music gaming week, haven't you?

36
00:02:58,969 --> 00:02:59,669
[SPEAKER_03]: Just a couple days.

37
00:03:00,309 --> 00:03:00,489
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah?

38
00:03:00,509 --> 00:03:00,669
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

39
00:03:01,410 --> 00:03:03,190
[SPEAKER_03]: Every time I go home, Dan's either playing...

40
00:03:04,764 --> 00:03:06,005
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, he's now playing Snake Eater.

41
00:03:07,085 --> 00:03:08,446
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought he beat Metal Gear Solid 3.

42
00:03:09,447 --> 00:03:10,007
[SPEAKER_02]: No, not yet.

43
00:03:10,027 --> 00:03:10,567
[SPEAKER_03]: He didn't bother.

44
00:03:11,468 --> 00:03:15,290
[SPEAKER_03]: But he's playing that now, but I've been coming home to him playing Guitar Freaks.

45
00:03:15,390 --> 00:03:15,910
[SPEAKER_03]: It's been funny.

46
00:03:16,490 --> 00:03:17,271
[SPEAKER_03]: It's been so cute.

47
00:03:17,291 --> 00:03:20,373
[SPEAKER_02]: But at least it's both Konami games.

48
00:03:21,073 --> 00:03:23,975
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you go from US Konami to Japanese Konami.

49
00:03:24,835 --> 00:03:25,135
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

50
00:03:25,475 --> 00:03:27,256
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I was playing Final Fantasy XI.

51
00:03:28,017 --> 00:03:28,397
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course.

52
00:03:28,477 --> 00:03:32,099
[SPEAKER_02]: It's so weird to hear you talk about playing Final Fantasy XI.

53
00:03:32,219 --> 00:03:33,600
[SPEAKER_02]: That was me and Loki's thing.

54
00:03:35,228 --> 00:03:36,469
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't play it that much.

55
00:03:37,209 --> 00:03:38,329
[SPEAKER_03]: Like an hour a day.

56
00:03:40,050 --> 00:03:40,850
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, whatever.

57
00:03:40,870 --> 00:03:41,270
[SPEAKER_03]: After school.

58
00:03:41,551 --> 00:03:42,431
[SPEAKER_02]: That's how it starts.

59
00:03:42,811 --> 00:03:43,591
[SPEAKER_02]: That's how it starts.

60
00:03:44,212 --> 00:03:44,952
[SPEAKER_03]: I have a life.

61
00:03:45,432 --> 00:03:45,992
[SPEAKER_03]: Me too!

62
00:03:46,713 --> 00:03:48,914
[SPEAKER_03]: I go to school and the gym and I work.

63
00:03:49,834 --> 00:03:52,915
[SPEAKER_02]: I work and I drink.

64
00:03:54,796 --> 00:03:56,337
[SPEAKER_03]: You exercise your liquor.

65
00:03:56,937 --> 00:03:57,917
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what?

66
00:03:58,077 --> 00:03:58,778
[SPEAKER_02]: I work out.

67
00:03:58,858 --> 00:04:02,499
[SPEAKER_02]: I pick up that heavy bottle of liquor and I pick it up and bring it towards my mouth.

68
00:04:02,579 --> 00:04:03,379
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a little flick.

69
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:04,240
[SPEAKER_02]: Forget it.

70
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:04,880
[SPEAKER_02]: Who am I trying to kid?

71
00:04:05,478 --> 00:04:06,579
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki, what have you been playing this week?

72
00:04:08,801 --> 00:04:11,243
[SPEAKER_02]: Other than Final Fantasy, not really much.

73
00:04:11,463 --> 00:04:14,645
[SPEAKER_02]: I played some Flash games last night that were weird.

74
00:04:16,647 --> 00:04:17,828
[SPEAKER_02]: God, I can't remember the website.

75
00:04:17,968 --> 00:04:25,594
[SPEAKER_02]: It was just, like, they had one, it was Drunken Walk, where you had to, like, make sure your character's balanced, otherwise he falls over and passes out.

76
00:04:26,154 --> 00:04:32,019
[SPEAKER_02]: There was another one that was called Wheel, and it was, like, it was some weird Flash games.

77
00:04:32,039 --> 00:04:34,661
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot of really interesting stuff out there that people make, and

78
00:04:35,521 --> 00:04:35,922
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for watching!

79
00:04:45,075 --> 00:05:06,173
[SPEAKER_02]: DDR Angel, who's a common guest we have on the Sunday show, she's heard me constantly bitching about no good games out on DS right now, so she decided to bring over Mr. Driller on the DS so I could check it out, because she's like, hey, there's this new game, and I played it a little bit before, maybe for like five minutes, but I didn't really get to play it a little more in depth until earlier, and...

80
00:05:07,961 --> 00:05:08,622
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of neat.

81
00:05:08,962 --> 00:05:09,943
[SPEAKER_02]: I like it.

82
00:05:10,063 --> 00:05:11,844
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the same Mr. Driller game.

83
00:05:11,864 --> 00:05:14,446
[SPEAKER_02]: There's really not a whole lot that the DS adds to it.

84
00:05:14,506 --> 00:05:17,788
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just like, oh, it's another freaking Mr. Driller game.

85
00:05:18,529 --> 00:05:24,053
[SPEAKER_02]: But Mr. Driller is kind of one of those games where I really want to get good at it because I like puzzle games a lot.

86
00:05:24,073 --> 00:05:30,337
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of my favorite games are puzzle games like Tetris, Super Puzzle Fighter 2 Turbo, and all that.

87
00:05:30,898 --> 00:05:32,399
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to be good at Mr. Driller, but

88
00:05:33,061 --> 00:05:34,862
[SPEAKER_02]: The strategy isn't clicking for me.

89
00:05:34,962 --> 00:05:37,244
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, I can't figure out how to get good at that game.

90
00:05:37,584 --> 00:05:38,905
[SPEAKER_02]: I just, I keep hammering.

91
00:05:39,185 --> 00:05:43,068
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to drill down as fast as possible because I think that's the way to do it.

92
00:05:43,128 --> 00:05:47,672
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's, you have to think about where the bricks are going to fall and my brain isn't developed yet.

93
00:05:47,812 --> 00:05:48,712
[SPEAKER_02]: It's too tough.

94
00:05:50,594 --> 00:05:53,736
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, Mr. Driller DS, it's just freaking Mr. Driller.

95
00:05:54,281 --> 00:05:54,321
[SPEAKER_02]: D.S.

96
00:05:54,341 --> 00:05:54,521
[SPEAKER_02]: PiktoChat

97
00:06:14,036 --> 00:06:15,177
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't remember which game it is.

98
00:06:15,697 --> 00:06:36,949
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a game coming out where while you're playing the game I think it's even like a puzzle game or something like that where you're playing the game and there will be a little icon or whatever that will come up if someone's within distance of you that's in PictoChat and you can quit out your game to go to PictoChat or invite them into a multiplayer game.

99
00:06:37,989 --> 00:06:42,952
[SPEAKER_02]: So it was kind of neat and I wish that they would add that to future games because

100
00:06:43,516 --> 00:06:44,756
[SPEAKER_02]: or something like that.

101
00:06:44,796 --> 00:06:46,337
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what they need.

102
00:07:13,959 --> 00:07:23,085
[SPEAKER_02]: I absolutely agree the DS needed something like this from the start and a lot of Xbox Live games when Xbox Live was first out didn't have this either and they really needed it because

103
00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:27,821
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I want to know if certain people around are playing the DS.

104
00:07:27,961 --> 00:07:29,141
[SPEAKER_02]: Who's in PictoChat?

105
00:07:29,481 --> 00:07:29,962
[SPEAKER_02]: What room?

106
00:07:29,982 --> 00:07:34,443
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, when they first advertised the DS, do you remember that movie they were showing at E3?

107
00:07:34,783 --> 00:07:40,604
[SPEAKER_02]: And they showed like the kid was reading a book upstairs and the mom was sending a message on PictoChat saying like, come down and eat dinner?

108
00:07:41,004 --> 00:07:43,125
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, how would the kid ever know that?

109
00:07:43,505 --> 00:07:46,166
[SPEAKER_02]: If your DS is off, you're not in PictoChat.

110
00:07:46,186 --> 00:07:50,387
[SPEAKER_02]: The thing doesn't beep to let you know somebody's trying to send you a PictoChat message or anything like that.

111
00:07:50,707 --> 00:07:51,347
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like the system...

112
00:07:51,907 --> 00:08:20,652
[SPEAKER_02]: now granted when you see things at E3 it's stuff that's in development so you know maybe that thing hadn't been finalized or whatever but at least it needs something where I think you were saying this to me earlier at least it could show you like who around you if people are playing DS's around you like when you if you look at the webcam for one of our Sunday night shows here we do on Orange Sounds Radio there's usually five people here in studio all playing DS's there should be a way to see what game each person around you is playing honestly DS needs something like that so

113
00:08:22,133 --> 00:08:22,994
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

114
00:08:53,157 --> 00:09:21,396
[SPEAKER_02]: 250 or as they would have you want to know 249 of course that doesn't figure in the tax so you really are going to be paying 250 plus for this and it's going to come with a 32 megabyte memory stick including there will be 24 games that are confirmed for the launch which is probably more games than the DS has out now so that's one thing the PSP is going to have going out the gate so if I were Nintendo I'd be a little worried right now but

115
00:09:22,452 --> 00:09:24,573
[SPEAKER_02]: PSP has a firm date set.

116
00:09:24,894 --> 00:09:26,075
[SPEAKER_02]: Now here's the interesting thing.

117
00:09:26,655 --> 00:09:30,918
[SPEAKER_02]: There may be another, I think, or what was this deal here?

118
00:09:31,258 --> 00:09:33,220
[SPEAKER_02]: It's, okay, I'm sorry.

119
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:42,266
[SPEAKER_02]: Also in the pack, headphones with a remote control, battery pack, AC adapter, case, cleaning cloth, game demo, so you're not getting any

120
00:09:43,408 --> 00:09:44,169
[SPEAKER_02]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

121
00:10:02,165 --> 00:10:04,506
[SPEAKER_02]: As if you didn't know in the movie on DVD already.

122
00:10:04,566 --> 00:10:06,207
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, talk about a horde movie.

123
00:10:06,347 --> 00:10:10,789
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, you can get Spider-Man 2 in the checkout lane at the grocery store.

124
00:10:10,829 --> 00:10:12,710
[SPEAKER_02]: That's how, like, everywhere this movie is.

125
00:10:12,730 --> 00:10:14,531
[SPEAKER_02]: And of course, it's a huge movie.

126
00:10:14,831 --> 00:10:16,732
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a very audience-friendly movie.

127
00:10:16,892 --> 00:10:17,632
[SPEAKER_02]: I like the movie.

128
00:10:17,652 --> 00:10:18,753
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of people like the movie.

129
00:10:18,813 --> 00:10:21,614
[SPEAKER_02]: But damn, talk about oversaturation.

130
00:10:21,734 --> 00:10:22,835
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if that's, you know...

131
00:10:24,028 --> 00:10:32,976
[SPEAKER_02]: That doesn't make me that excited to be one of the first million people who's like, Ooh, I can have Spider-Man 2 again in my pocket to watch again.

132
00:10:33,757 --> 00:10:36,840
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just wondering if they fixed the amazing game launcher function.

133
00:10:38,801 --> 00:10:40,243
[SPEAKER_02]: Mention this one more time for our listeners.

134
00:10:40,843 --> 00:10:44,166
[SPEAKER_03]: The game launcher function where if you twist it, your game shoots out.

135
00:10:46,148 --> 00:10:48,330
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can hold up a bank with the game launcher, really.

136
00:10:50,152 --> 00:10:50,472
[SPEAKER_03]: No, Rob.

137
00:10:53,548 --> 00:10:54,148
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, maybe not.

138
00:10:55,789 --> 00:11:02,350
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, one of the things that I have to laugh about this is the memory stick thing.

139
00:11:04,151 --> 00:11:07,591
[SPEAKER_02]: With that, I'm sure people are going to have Linux on this in no time.

140
00:11:10,612 --> 00:11:13,273
[SPEAKER_02]: People will install Linux in a shoebox.

141
00:11:13,893 --> 00:11:17,394
[SPEAKER_02]: Anything with a monitor, they will try to install Linux on.

142
00:11:17,414 --> 00:11:18,674
[SPEAKER_02]: Didn't we talk about this last week?

143
00:11:18,714 --> 00:11:19,794
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't remember which show it was.

144
00:11:19,814 --> 00:11:22,875
[SPEAKER_02]: We talked about Linux being installed on the iPod, and I'm just like,

145
00:11:23,513 --> 00:11:25,154
[SPEAKER_02]: They will install Linux on anything.

146
00:11:25,414 --> 00:11:25,855
[SPEAKER_02]: Anything.

147
00:11:25,875 --> 00:11:27,256
[SPEAKER_03]: They will install Linux on an iPod.

148
00:11:29,358 --> 00:11:32,340
[SPEAKER_02]: They're working on Linux on the DS right now, honestly.

149
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:33,941
[SPEAKER_02]: I kid you not.

150
00:11:34,762 --> 00:11:36,783
[SPEAKER_02]: It's so crazy.

151
00:11:40,166 --> 00:11:41,927
[SPEAKER_02]: Do they have Linux on Commodore 64?

152
00:11:42,768 --> 00:11:43,408
[SPEAKER_02]: That rocks.

153
00:11:44,489 --> 00:11:45,270
[SPEAKER_02]: That so rocks.

154
00:11:45,350 --> 00:11:45,630
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright.

155
00:11:47,830 --> 00:12:09,850
[SPEAKER_02]: quick gaming note, I want to get to DarkSakura's advice column for the week, I want to give a quick gaming note, this is a series I played for a little bit, I didn't finish this game though, but it was a good game, it kind of felt like watching a movie sometimes though, I didn't have a lot of control over the game, Xenosaga, it's getting a sequel, it came out a while ago, it came out, it felt like it came out quite a while ago, it's just now getting a sequel, February 15th,

156
00:12:11,238 --> 00:12:18,021
[SPEAKER_02]: Very soon, Xenosaga Part 2, developed by Monolith Soft, same studio that did Episode 1.

157
00:12:19,202 --> 00:12:25,625
[SPEAKER_02]: And Xenosaga 2 will have more than 100 skills for characters, including Last Revenge, Overload, Double Power.

158
00:12:25,985 --> 00:12:32,688
[SPEAKER_02]: New to the battle system are Double Attacks, and that will be like a team-up mode, where you do a team-up and you do one big assault.

159
00:12:32,768 --> 00:12:33,949
[SPEAKER_02]: So, Xenosaga 2.

160
00:12:35,269 --> 00:12:37,050
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you ever play the Xenosaga games at all, Jamie?

161
00:12:37,913 --> 00:12:38,073
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

162
00:12:38,193 --> 00:12:39,534
[SPEAKER_02]: You didn't just really get into the series?

163
00:12:39,914 --> 00:12:40,054
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

164
00:12:40,154 --> 00:12:48,578
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought you were the one that... That was... One of my old buddies made me play it, actually play it, but I thought you were the one that first told me about it.

165
00:12:48,598 --> 00:12:51,159
[SPEAKER_03]: That was Miklatov, who was into Xenogears.

166
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:51,960
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe.

167
00:12:52,580 --> 00:12:53,060
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

168
00:12:53,260 --> 00:13:00,984
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't remember, however, the hint to the existence of Xenogears in Final Fantasy VII, when Cloud's in the hospital.

169
00:13:01,879 --> 00:13:03,440
[SPEAKER_03]: And he's mumbling incoherently.

170
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,781
[SPEAKER_03]: And he says, Zenogias.

171
00:13:08,001 --> 00:13:09,802
[SPEAKER_03]: Z-E-N-O dot dot dot.

172
00:13:09,862 --> 00:13:10,742
[SPEAKER_03]: G-I-A-S.

173
00:13:13,863 --> 00:13:16,084
[SPEAKER_02]: All sorts of little inside jokes in those Squeenix games.

174
00:13:16,865 --> 00:13:17,245
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright.

175
00:13:18,485 --> 00:13:21,446
[SPEAKER_02]: We here at Orange House Radio, not only do we want to make your lives... I'm sorry.

176
00:13:21,486 --> 00:13:26,308
[SPEAKER_02]: Not only do we want to talk about what's going on in the video game world, but we want to make your lives better.

177
00:13:26,688 --> 00:13:29,169
[SPEAKER_02]: Therefore, the usually angsty DarkSakura...

178
00:13:29,827 --> 00:13:35,855
[SPEAKER_02]: has her little advice column for you guys and we call it DarkSakura's Advice Column.

179
00:13:37,618 --> 00:13:39,300
[SPEAKER_02]: Jamie, what did you bring for us this week?

180
00:13:39,821 --> 00:13:42,104
[SPEAKER_03]: Today's bit of advice is how to win a bar fight.

181
00:13:43,860 --> 00:13:52,745
[SPEAKER_03]: Most state laws stipulate that you may use sufficient force to stop an attack, but you may not deliver any sort of punitive retribution to your attacker.

182
00:13:53,706 --> 00:13:56,207
[SPEAKER_03]: Remembering this may save you a costly trip to the court.

183
00:13:56,247 --> 00:13:59,849
[SPEAKER_03]: Basically, in English, you can stop someone from attacking you, but you can't punch them back.

184
00:14:01,210 --> 00:14:01,350
[SPEAKER_02]: Aww.

185
00:14:02,111 --> 00:14:03,712
[SPEAKER_02]: Where's the fun in that bar fight?

186
00:14:04,132 --> 00:14:05,093
[SPEAKER_03]: Eh, this is just how to win.

187
00:14:05,113 --> 00:14:06,553
[SPEAKER_02]: What about breaking a bottle on their head?

188
00:14:06,593 --> 00:14:07,134
[SPEAKER_02]: Does that count?

189
00:14:07,914 --> 00:14:10,216
[SPEAKER_03]: If it's enough to stop them from hitting you again, sure.

190
00:14:11,778 --> 00:14:14,559
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, here's four easy steps to win a bar fight.

191
00:14:15,539 --> 00:14:18,800
[SPEAKER_03]: Number one, attack the most sensitive areas of your opponent.

192
00:14:19,300 --> 00:14:20,681
[SPEAKER_03]: Eyes, groin, knee, and throat.

193
00:14:21,241 --> 00:14:21,941
[SPEAKER_03]: Stay close.

194
00:14:22,121 --> 00:14:24,562
[SPEAKER_03]: If your opponent is large, he will need room to hit you.

195
00:14:25,422 --> 00:14:28,183
[SPEAKER_03]: Two, attack repeatedly and be efficient.

196
00:14:28,543 --> 00:14:32,244
[SPEAKER_03]: Make fast, repeated blows to any or all sensitive areas.

197
00:14:32,284 --> 00:14:34,925
[SPEAKER_02]: I want a nice, clean, efficient bar fight.

198
00:14:36,285 --> 00:14:38,526
[SPEAKER_03]: That means kicking the balls repeatedly.

199
00:14:40,452 --> 00:14:45,356
[SPEAKER_03]: Number three, if necessary, use a weapon.

200
00:14:45,976 --> 00:14:51,360
[SPEAKER_03]: Choices include telephones, pens, bottles, books, beer mugs, coffee cups, and keys.

201
00:14:52,581 --> 00:14:59,025
[SPEAKER_03]: Four, protect yourself from additional attackers by fighting with your back too, but not up against a corner or a wall.

202
00:15:00,506 --> 00:15:01,467
[SPEAKER_02]: Very interesting.

203
00:15:02,248 --> 00:15:04,569
[SPEAKER_03]: I also have a little bit more to add to that.

204
00:15:04,689 --> 00:15:04,970
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

205
00:15:04,990 --> 00:15:06,831
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a move that they taught us in my karate class.

206
00:15:07,416 --> 00:15:14,302
[SPEAKER_03]: If you happen to be picked up and have the ever-loving chick squeezed out of you, all you have to do is get your hands free and hit them on the side of the head with your palms.

207
00:15:15,663 --> 00:15:17,985
[SPEAKER_03]: I would demonstrate, but our listeners will not see that.

208
00:15:18,025 --> 00:15:21,948
[SPEAKER_02]: Kind of like how when you do something stupid, your mom smacks you upside the head and goes, What were you thinking?

209
00:15:22,428 --> 00:15:26,131
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, no, it's more of like with both hands at once.

210
00:15:26,231 --> 00:15:28,373
[SPEAKER_03]: Both hands on the side, because it will disorient them.

211
00:15:30,234 --> 00:15:30,975
[SPEAKER_02]: Very interesting thought.

212
00:15:32,005 --> 00:15:33,006
[SPEAKER_02]: DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

213
00:15:59,591 --> 00:16:02,192
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, maybe not, but it doesn't stop it from happening.

214
00:16:03,233 --> 00:16:04,914
[SPEAKER_02]: Guess what game's coming next?

215
00:16:06,074 --> 00:16:08,456
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, you knew this was going to happen.

216
00:16:08,816 --> 00:16:21,823
[SPEAKER_02]: Variety is reporting that Microsoft has quietly put the finishing touches on a million dollar deal with the guy that wrote the movie 28 Days Later to adapt Halo, the movie.

217
00:16:22,343 --> 00:16:24,384
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, first of all.

218
00:16:25,284 --> 00:16:26,685
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, I like 28 Days Later.

219
00:16:26,745 --> 00:16:27,746
[SPEAKER_02]: That was a good movie.

220
00:16:27,806 --> 00:16:28,106
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

221
00:16:28,877 --> 00:16:29,897
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a good zombie movie.

222
00:16:30,918 --> 00:16:35,359
[SPEAKER_02]: Weird ending, but you know, it was a good movie.

223
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:37,600
[SPEAKER_03]: Halo movie.

224
00:16:38,900 --> 00:16:40,981
[SPEAKER_03]: We better not see what the Master Chief looks like.

225
00:16:42,162 --> 00:16:43,362
[SPEAKER_02]: 28 Days Later, a good zombie movie.

226
00:16:43,522 --> 00:16:45,423
[SPEAKER_02]: Evil Dead, a good zombie movie.

227
00:16:45,923 --> 00:16:47,984
[SPEAKER_02]: 28 Days Later, what the hell was that?

228
00:16:50,604 --> 00:16:52,285
[SPEAKER_02]: That was more like what it is.

229
00:16:52,525 --> 00:16:57,807
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, you know, we want to kind of do a Dawn of the Dead, but

230
00:16:58,399 --> 00:17:28,003
[SPEAKER_02]: not quite Dawn of the Dead let's make them run because that's a little different you know they don't normally run and then um we'll just go ahead and um I don't know make a really shitty ending here's the weird thing about Halo is that in many aspects it already is a movie so I don't kind of understand the but of course a lot of the Resident Evil games had a very movie feel to them and they made a game they made a movie out of that anyway but I mean yeah they made they made two movies out of Resident Evil but

231
00:17:28,851 --> 00:17:36,133
[SPEAKER_02]: The only movie that should ever be made, and I'm sure Jamie's going to agree with me on this, is Red vs. Blue the movie.

232
00:17:36,553 --> 00:17:37,834
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, we need Red vs. Blue the movie.

233
00:17:37,874 --> 00:17:46,696
[SPEAKER_02]: That is the only way that this movie will be any good, because Red vs. Blue, they could honestly put that on TV, and that would be entertaining.

234
00:17:47,597 --> 00:17:54,599
[SPEAKER_02]: I was going to say Castlevania the movie, which we've been bitching about for years, and no, Van Helsing was not Castlevania the movie.

235
00:17:54,799 --> 00:17:55,319
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry.

236
00:17:55,699 --> 00:17:58,420
[SPEAKER_03]: It needs to be like Dracula X version.

237
00:17:59,460 --> 00:18:01,101
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's good because at least then it will stay Halo

238
00:18:28,211 --> 00:18:57,062
[SPEAKER_02]: and not like Hollywood Halo well it's easy not to fuck up their movie don't get it to that one guy that made those three movies I mean he's the one that's crapping out these really shitty scripts actually I believe Resident Evil and Mortal Kombat were done by one guy and then Alone in the Dark and House of the Dead were done by another guy House of the Dead and Alone in the Dark guy that's the guy that should not touch any scripts for anything ever never ever ever touch anything okay

239
00:18:57,606 --> 00:19:02,409
[SPEAKER_02]: It scares me enough that the guy that directed Catwoman is going to be doing Akira.

240
00:19:02,589 --> 00:19:03,910
[SPEAKER_02]: That scares the shit out of me.

241
00:19:03,930 --> 00:19:04,010
[SPEAKER_01]: What?

242
00:19:04,530 --> 00:19:06,771
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, he will be doing the live action Akira.

243
00:19:07,091 --> 00:19:07,392
[SPEAKER_02]: What?

244
00:19:07,812 --> 00:19:11,194
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, so look forward to that piece of shit coming out.

245
00:19:14,435 --> 00:19:16,397
[SPEAKER_02]: Somewhere inside, I am crying.

246
00:19:16,677 --> 00:19:20,679
[SPEAKER_03]: And watch him fully base it off of the anime, which would absolutely suck.

247
00:19:21,249 --> 00:19:23,109
[SPEAKER_03]: They need to base it off of the manga for it to be any good.

248
00:19:23,129 --> 00:19:23,970
[SPEAKER_02]: Why did you hear that?

249
00:19:24,270 --> 00:19:29,351
[SPEAKER_02]: I realize you kind of work in the industry a little bit, so you pick up on things like that, but where did you hear something like that?

250
00:19:30,071 --> 00:19:31,652
[SPEAKER_02]: It was on Ain't It Cool News like a while ago.

251
00:19:32,132 --> 00:19:35,973
[SPEAKER_02]: They have, um, because they had a whole big thing about it and how they're like, oh god, why?

252
00:19:36,553 --> 00:19:37,913
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, but, I don't know.

253
00:19:39,333 --> 00:19:44,435
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't get me wrong, I love Ain'tItCoolNews.com, but I hope that's another one of their fake-ass rumors.

254
00:19:44,635 --> 00:19:45,195
[SPEAKER_02]: I really do.

255
00:19:45,795 --> 00:19:46,655
[SPEAKER_02]: There were some other ones.

256
00:19:46,715 --> 00:19:49,316
[SPEAKER_02]: There was, um, oh god, I want to say...

257
00:19:50,464 --> 00:19:50,864
[SPEAKER_02]: Who was it?

258
00:19:50,904 --> 00:19:55,587
[SPEAKER_02]: James Cameron's going to be picking up Battle Angel, which is going to be good.

259
00:19:55,887 --> 00:19:56,567
[SPEAKER_03]: That would be good.

260
00:19:56,848 --> 00:19:57,928
[SPEAKER_02]: James Cameron doing that.

261
00:19:58,088 --> 00:20:02,911
[SPEAKER_02]: So I can see that being pretty sweet.

262
00:20:02,931 --> 00:20:08,254
[SPEAKER_02]: Then, of course, you have the live-action Aeon Flux movie coming out, which should be pretty good, I imagine.

263
00:20:09,735 --> 00:20:12,436
[SPEAKER_02]: I have issues with Charlize Theron, though, but I'll save that for another show.

264
00:20:13,997 --> 00:20:15,318
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, moving on.

265
00:20:16,231 --> 00:20:18,053
[SPEAKER_02]: Speaking of movies, now let's go the other way.

266
00:20:18,113 --> 00:20:20,354
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's talk about movies going into games.

267
00:20:20,675 --> 00:20:22,096
[SPEAKER_02]: This was a big story this week.

268
00:20:22,536 --> 00:20:28,680
[SPEAKER_02]: EA is developing a game based on an old movie, The Godfather.

269
00:20:29,060 --> 00:20:39,448
[SPEAKER_02]: They're doing a Godfather game, and this made news this week because I believe Marlon Brando was quoted in an interview a long time ago, or somehow an article came up about him this week.

270
00:20:40,048 --> 00:20:43,631
[SPEAKER_02]: No, he wasn't quoted, but somebody had said about him that he initially refused

271
00:20:44,111 --> 00:20:47,812
[SPEAKER_02]: The part he played in the movie The Godfather, you know, you can't refuse that whole thing.

272
00:20:48,312 --> 00:20:52,393
[SPEAKER_02]: He refused that because he felt that the movie glorified the Mafia.

273
00:20:53,613 --> 00:20:57,854
[SPEAKER_02]: And it turns out he actually has loaned his voice talents to this game.

274
00:20:58,394 --> 00:20:59,334
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, he's dead.

275
00:20:59,654 --> 00:21:00,875
[SPEAKER_02]: He did it before he died.

276
00:21:00,935 --> 00:21:03,075
[SPEAKER_02]: This game's been in production for quite some time.

277
00:21:03,335 --> 00:21:07,056
[SPEAKER_02]: Marlon Brando actually loaned his voice to the game.

278
00:21:07,396 --> 00:21:08,876
[SPEAKER_02]: And what is this game going to be doing?

279
00:21:09,517 --> 00:21:11,257
[SPEAKER_02]: Glorifying the Mafia, you betcha.

280
00:21:12,483 --> 00:21:17,064
[SPEAKER_02]: And I hear that he's going to be releasing a new album with Tupac coming out later on.

281
00:21:17,204 --> 00:21:18,225
[SPEAKER_02]: And Elvis.

282
00:21:18,585 --> 00:21:21,786
[SPEAKER_02]: And Elvis, yeah, because they make new music even after they're dead.

283
00:21:23,546 --> 00:21:24,507
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyways, you were saying?

284
00:21:26,327 --> 00:21:34,810
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, Robert Duvall and James Caan will also be loading their voices to this, so that should be interesting.

285
00:21:35,230 --> 00:21:38,551
[SPEAKER_02]: And EA is going to have a big gala premiere of The Godfather February 10th.

286
00:21:40,271 --> 00:21:41,412
[SPEAKER_02]: and guess what?

287
00:21:41,512 --> 00:21:44,993
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to be first shown to the public in the New York City neighborhood of Little Italy.

288
00:21:45,473 --> 00:21:45,974
[SPEAKER_02]: Isn't that cute?

289
00:21:47,334 --> 00:21:47,795
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright.

290
00:21:48,595 --> 00:21:50,236
[SPEAKER_02]: One more news story for you guys tonight.

291
00:21:50,336 --> 00:21:51,356
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm excited about this.

292
00:21:51,556 --> 00:21:52,036
[SPEAKER_02]: I really am.

293
00:21:52,337 --> 00:21:53,317
[SPEAKER_02]: I saved the best for last.

294
00:21:54,217 --> 00:21:58,499
[SPEAKER_02]: Capcom is going to be doing a couple new compilations.

295
00:21:59,100 --> 00:22:02,781
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know how they did the Mega Man Anniversary Collection last year, which was such a good idea.

296
00:22:03,282 --> 00:22:04,222
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, it was such a good idea.

297
00:22:04,542 --> 00:22:05,763
[SPEAKER_02]: I was very pleased with that game.

298
00:22:06,603 --> 00:22:08,104
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you play the Mega Man compilation at all?

299
00:22:08,941 --> 00:22:10,702
[SPEAKER_03]: I did, but the timing was way off.

300
00:22:12,743 --> 00:22:14,064
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you play it on GameCube or PS2?

301
00:22:14,884 --> 00:22:17,225
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that we had Dan try it out on PS2.

302
00:22:18,205 --> 00:22:23,188
[SPEAKER_03]: Because on the NES, he can do Quickman's level without using the time stopper.

303
00:22:24,388 --> 00:22:25,969
[SPEAKER_03]: And he couldn't do it on the PS2.

304
00:22:26,349 --> 00:22:28,070
[SPEAKER_03]: But he came home and did it again on the NES.

305
00:22:28,690 --> 00:22:29,070
[SPEAKER_02]: Interesting.

306
00:22:30,311 --> 00:22:32,132
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll see.

307
00:22:33,264 --> 00:22:41,247
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but Mega Man, they're also going to be doing a Mega Man X collection, because the Mega Man Anniversary Collection did so well, they're going to do a compilation of all the Mega Man X games.

308
00:22:41,647 --> 00:22:43,467
[SPEAKER_02]: This really shouldn't be a surprise to anyone.

309
00:22:43,507 --> 00:22:46,248
[SPEAKER_02]: I think this is kind of a foregone conclusion, but that's pretty cool.

310
00:22:46,728 --> 00:22:54,911
[SPEAKER_02]: They actually released this little trailer that just, they haven't said exactly what games are going to be in it, but they did catch one unlockable that's going to be in the game.

311
00:22:55,291 --> 00:22:59,072
[SPEAKER_02]: Mega Man Battle and Chase will be an unlockable that's in the Mega Man X collection.

312
00:22:59,329 --> 00:23:00,749
[SPEAKER_03]: It's pretty obscure, that's cool.

313
00:23:00,930 --> 00:23:06,912
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, but I mean, if you think about it, the two arcade games that they put in the Mega Man collection to begin with were also pretty obscure.

314
00:23:07,572 --> 00:23:08,852
[SPEAKER_02]: Where's Mega Man Soccer?

315
00:23:10,093 --> 00:23:11,273
[SPEAKER_02]: I want that in a collection.

316
00:23:12,994 --> 00:23:13,214
[SPEAKER_02]: What?

317
00:23:13,914 --> 00:23:14,614
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what they need?

318
00:23:15,174 --> 00:23:17,455
[SPEAKER_02]: Is fucking Mega Man Legends 3, okay?

319
00:23:17,695 --> 00:23:18,596
[SPEAKER_02]: I love those games.

320
00:23:18,896 --> 00:23:21,436
[SPEAKER_02]: Even a Mega Man Legends Online would be awesome.

321
00:23:21,757 --> 00:23:25,858
[SPEAKER_02]: Because that could totally, you know, become an RPG, even though it's like all weird and everything.

322
00:23:28,339 --> 00:23:39,003
[SPEAKER_02]: Capcom, by the way, is also going to be developing a Capcom Classics Collection, and it's going to be basically this compilation of classic games from Capcom.

323
00:23:39,363 --> 00:23:53,948
[SPEAKER_02]: They haven't said what games are going to be in it, but they're hinting that it will include old school favorites, such as those that have been seen in the Capcom's Generations compilations that were released in Japan for the Saturn and PlayStation.

324
00:23:54,068 --> 00:23:55,128
[SPEAKER_03]: I actually have one of those.

325
00:23:55,148 --> 00:23:57,649
[SPEAKER_03]: I have the Makai Mura set, which is...

326
00:23:58,459 --> 00:24:24,348
[SPEAKER_02]: ghouls and ghosts, ghosts and goblins see now I think those are the kinds of things and might I say Capcom pretty pretty pretty please I have a couple requests Bionic Commando, Strider Magic Sword Strider and Quiz and Dragons how cool would that be okay I'm kidding on the last one

327
00:24:24,651 --> 00:24:31,613
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, I want them to do, though, an arcade compl... The thing about Strider is that they released it as part of the Strider 2 set.

328
00:24:33,374 --> 00:24:37,275
[SPEAKER_03]: Which is funny, because they even made the changes... Because we have the Japanese version and the U.S.

329
00:24:37,295 --> 00:24:39,196
[SPEAKER_03]: version, because my fiancé is a big Strider fiend.

330
00:24:41,297 --> 00:24:46,919
[SPEAKER_03]: For any of our listeners who ever frequented any of the Strider sites, he actually had Neo Strider's Strider Zone back in the day.

331
00:24:48,179 --> 00:24:49,540
[SPEAKER_03]: Which is one of the first ones out there.

332
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:49,900
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.

333
00:24:51,849 --> 00:24:55,430
[SPEAKER_03]: But the first one where he's swinging, he sort of goes, ha, ha, ha, ha, the whole time.

334
00:24:55,851 --> 00:24:56,771
[SPEAKER_03]: He doesn't do that in the U.S.

335
00:24:56,871 --> 00:24:59,072
[SPEAKER_03]: one, and they fully did the U.S.

336
00:24:59,632 --> 00:25:00,332
[SPEAKER_03]: when they brought that out.

337
00:25:00,873 --> 00:25:05,655
[SPEAKER_03]: But we need Captain Commando.

338
00:25:07,035 --> 00:25:07,255
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

339
00:25:07,575 --> 00:25:08,636
[SPEAKER_03]: We need Captain Commando.

340
00:25:08,896 --> 00:25:09,276
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, we do.

341
00:25:09,576 --> 00:25:10,777
[SPEAKER_03]: And we need the D&D games.

342
00:25:12,417 --> 00:25:14,078
[SPEAKER_02]: And I want Super Slam Masters again.

343
00:25:14,358 --> 00:25:15,058
[SPEAKER_03]: Super Slam Masters.

344
00:25:15,419 --> 00:25:17,680
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, Captain Commando did come out on the PlayStation.

345
00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:18,620
[SPEAKER_02]: It was three-player.

346
00:25:19,810 --> 00:25:21,231
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't remember that coming out on the PlayStation.

347
00:25:21,251 --> 00:25:21,471
[SPEAKER_02]: It did.

348
00:25:21,792 --> 00:25:22,132
[SPEAKER_02]: I have it.

349
00:25:22,732 --> 00:25:23,493
[SPEAKER_02]: It's awesome.

350
00:25:24,794 --> 00:25:25,614
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, we'll see.

351
00:25:26,015 --> 00:25:27,236
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I have high hopes for this.

352
00:25:27,336 --> 00:25:29,337
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope it's as good as those Midway collections.

353
00:25:29,377 --> 00:25:31,339
[SPEAKER_02]: Seriously, those are some of the best collections I've played.

354
00:25:31,739 --> 00:25:39,625
[SPEAKER_02]: And I hope it's not like the Nintendo collections where they put 20... I'm sorry, they put one game, released it for 20 bucks on a Game Boy Advance cart.

355
00:25:39,925 --> 00:25:43,268
[SPEAKER_02]: Especially when it's games that were unlockable in other games, i.e.

356
00:25:43,348 --> 00:25:43,968
[SPEAKER_02]: Metroid.

357
00:25:44,509 --> 00:25:44,889
[SPEAKER_02]: Shame.

358
00:25:44,929 --> 00:25:47,471
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, a couple of them were cool, like Zelda was cool.

359
00:25:48,402 --> 00:25:50,763
[SPEAKER_02]: But seriously, $20 for Donkey Kong?

360
00:25:51,004 --> 00:25:51,864
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think so.

361
00:25:52,464 --> 00:25:54,266
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not the way to do these compilations.

362
00:25:54,646 --> 00:25:56,567
[SPEAKER_02]: Midway knows how to do the compilations.

363
00:25:56,867 --> 00:25:58,408
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope Capcom takes the page out of their book.

364
00:25:59,369 --> 00:26:01,910
[SPEAKER_02]: You could just play Animal Crossing and get all those games.

365
00:26:02,450 --> 00:26:05,312
[SPEAKER_02]: Animal Crossing is like a $240 value.

366
00:26:07,313 --> 00:26:08,394
[SPEAKER_02]: It's one way to think about it.

367
00:26:08,554 --> 00:26:10,915
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, that's going to do it for this podcast.

368
00:26:11,236 --> 00:26:12,957
[SPEAKER_02]: Jamie, any parting words for our listeners?

369
00:26:13,357 --> 00:26:13,957
[SPEAKER_02]: Parting words?

370
00:26:15,018 --> 00:26:15,378
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki.

371
00:26:16,839 --> 00:26:16,979
[SPEAKER_02]: Nope.

372
00:26:18,168 --> 00:26:20,249
[SPEAKER_02]: Well then I guess I will be apathetic too.

373
00:26:20,390 --> 00:26:21,050
[SPEAKER_02]: Have a good one.

374
00:26:21,090 --> 00:26:22,431
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for subscribing to us.

375
00:26:22,831 --> 00:26:23,832
[SPEAKER_02]: See you next week guys.
