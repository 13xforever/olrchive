And they've kind of the levels of some instruments are up a little and down

99
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:55,660
It's all cleaner and it's nice and crisp and clear when you listen to this on the soundtrack a lot of these songs are just

What so proudly we hailed

128
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:04,500
Therefore, veggie

129
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:09,500
And joy is our own

130
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:59,160

Some great songs in there.

135
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:09,200
That last song you guys heard was actually, I think it was one of the songs that you actually,

136
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:13,040
it was like an unlock or release later song, 2Dx Red, I could be wrong on that, but I know

137
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:19,180
that song didn't come out until after a lot of the others, Ryu, with an, it's, forgive

138
00:17:19,180 --> 00:17:24,440
me if I pronounce this wrong, it's just a-gee-ha, or something like that, A-G-E-H-A, a-gee-ha.

139
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:25,440
A-gee-ha.

140
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:26,440
I think so.

141
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:34,240
that the song sphere from 2d x11 pretty cool song evo 66 which by the way is by

142
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:38,800
the same group that did North from 2d x4 style you guys remember that song it was

143
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:48,160
like very I don't know like like Renaissance fair rave type song I really

144
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:52,240
don't know how to explain that song well let me play a little bit of North okay

145
00:17:52,240 --> 00:18:04,840
Okay, here's a little, like, clip of North from 2DX4 style.

146
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:21,440
Kinda, like, happy, like, fluid or something, and then they go from that to this.

147
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:30,480
this is a little more Rave-ish, I don't know. I don't know, how do you get from point A

148
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:36,560
to point B? I have no idea. All right. And then starting that set off, Injection of Love,

149
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:42,840
the song where she says, Fook me. What the Fook is going on over there, you guys? What

150
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:46,040
are you guys? No, we're just Fooking around. Oh, okay. What are you Fooking doing? What

151
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:52,640

155
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:12,760
LiveJournal, really. Jamie, how was your week, how was your day? Um, my week was pretty okay.

156
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:14,480
It was, work was great.

157
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:16,720
I love my job now.

158
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:20,720
You know, I made a comment to my boss that I had no job stress.

159
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:24,600
He was like, what was this business where I was like, no, there's a difference between

160
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:28,420
having a lot of work to do and having emotional stress, and I don't have any of that at my

161
00:19:28,420 --> 00:19:29,420
job now.

162
00:19:29,420 --> 00:19:30,580
So it's been really great.

163
00:19:30,580 --> 00:19:31,960
I can go to work happy.

164
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:33,520
I can leave happy.

165
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:35,440
I can be happy all day at work.

166
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:36,600
How many people can say that?

167
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:38,680
When I got my last promotion, I felt the exact same way.

168
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:46,360
I went from feeling useless to feeling good about what I did.

169
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:48,320
I literally felt useless in my old position.

170
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:51,360
In my old position I had the evil VP who I hoped dies.

171
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:53,360
I liked everybody I worked with.

172
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:57,820
I don't think I've really worked with any bad people unless they were people who weren't

173
00:19:57,820 --> 00:19:58,820
there very long.

174
00:19:58,820 --> 00:20:00,000
I enjoy my entire team.

175
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:04,880
I've had the fortune of working with good people, but that doesn't always mean that

176
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:07,640
I was doing the best kind of work, you know what I mean?

177
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:13,140
My work is really easy, it's all spreadsheets and computer stuff that I don't have to really...

178
00:20:13,140 --> 00:20:17,060
I can listen to my music, as long as I can listen to my music and do my work, I'm a happy

179
00:20:17,060 --> 00:20:18,060
bunny.

180
00:20:18,060 --> 00:20:19,060
And what do you do?

181
00:20:19,060 --> 00:20:20,060
You listen to a fan of the opera while you work?

182
00:20:20,060 --> 00:20:21,060
Dude, I was.

183
00:20:21,060 --> 00:20:25,060
And one of my co-workers came up and goes, oh my god, this is awesome, so which track

184
00:20:25,060 --> 00:20:26,060
are you on?

185
00:20:26,060 --> 00:20:30,060
She tried to figure out what track I was listening to by the playlist.

186
00:20:30,060 --> 00:20:34,860
I want to know, is it timed so that when you walk in the door, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo,

187
00:20:34,860 --> 00:20:35,860
doo, doo.

188
00:20:35,860 --> 00:20:36,860
When I'm driving, yes.

189
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:40,240
That's how I wake up in the morning is by putting in my Phantom of the Opera soundtrack.

190
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:44,060
That should be somebody's alarm in the morning.

191
00:20:44,060 --> 00:20:48,740
Like, can you imagine you're resting all peacefully and then the sun's coming up and then your CD player kicks in

192
00:20:48,740 --> 00:20:49,760
and it's at max volume?

193
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:53,120
Doooooo! Do do do do doooooo!

194
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:56,380
That would be awesome. I should do that again one day.

195
00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:59,380
You just have to be very funny chandeliers.

196
00:20:59,380 --> 00:21:02,580
Yeah, it's so loud the chandelier falls. Ha ha ha. Anyway.

197
00:21:02,580 --> 00:21:06,780
And in our case it would be the halogen lamp falls over.

198
00:21:06,780 --> 00:21:11,780
Um, it turns out it was the cat after all. She's, you know, the cat.

199
00:21:11,780 --> 00:21:12,780
Your cat's playing?

200
00:21:12,780 --> 00:21:15,780
The cat's the bantam.

201
00:21:15,780 --> 00:21:17,780
How do you tune your cats?

202
00:21:17,780 --> 00:21:21,780
Kick her.

203
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:25,780
I don't know. She wakes, I swear I wake up to the cat in the face.

204
00:21:25,780 --> 00:21:26,780
Meow.

205
00:21:26,780 --> 00:21:28,780
Mom, feed me.

206
00:21:28,780 --> 00:21:29,780
Meow.

207
00:21:29,780 --> 00:21:30,780
Meow.

208
00:21:30,780 --> 00:21:31,780
Meow.

209
00:21:31,780 --> 00:21:32,780
Meow.

210
00:21:32,780 --> 00:21:33,780
Meow.

211
00:21:33,780 --> 00:21:34,780
Meow.

212
00:21:34,780 --> 00:21:35,780
Meow.

213
00:21:35,780 --> 00:21:39,120
on your face this week? She's been sleeping under the covers. Okay, that's good, because

214
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:42,100
I remember last week, Shermie had slipped on your face the night before. You were kind

215
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:46,660
of out of it last week. I was on lots of drugs. Yeah. Lots of drugs. I mean, if I had had

216
00:21:46,660 --> 00:21:51,860
pussy in my face all night long, I'd probably be... You'd need drugs. I'd need a lot of

217
00:21:51,860 --> 00:21:57,740
drugs, honey. Well, anyway, um, we had Guitar Freaks hooked up, so we've been playing Guitar

218
00:21:57,740 --> 00:22:03,180
Freaks all week. Oh yeah? Um, I finally... Are you pissed off that they never released

219
00:22:03,180 --> 00:22:07,860
any new ones on PlayStation? Dan is, but we're looking for the second I pen now. Okay. But

220
00:22:07,860 --> 00:22:13,260
I finally, finally passed Liar Liar all the way through. Yay. I'm not really all that

221
00:22:13,260 --> 00:22:19,500
great at Guitar Freaks. But I can pass Carnival Day like it's a, you know, nothing. That was

222
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:25,460
one of the bonus tracks from Fifth. Why, why will they not put Guitar Freaks 5, it's Guitar

223
00:22:25,460 --> 00:22:30,380
Freaks 5 isn't out for home, right? Yeah, it is. I thought Guitar Freaks 4... It's the

224
00:22:30,380 --> 00:22:40,380
one that was Guitadora. Guitar Freaks 5, Germania 4. I thought that they stopped with 4.3. I

225
00:22:40,380 --> 00:22:44,820
think it's 4.3 is where they stopped. Okay, no, you're right. It's 3 seconds and then

226
00:22:44,820 --> 00:22:49,860
4.3. 4.3. And then 5.4 is the one they really need to do. Like, all of my favorite Guitar

227
00:22:49,860 --> 00:22:54,140
Freak songs were on 5th. And then 6. And there's, you know, there's good ones as the series

228
00:22:54,140 --> 00:22:59,140
It depends on you though on the 4th, 3rd, and Liar Liar and Dynamite.

229
00:22:59,140 --> 00:23:04,140
I'm not saying there's bad songs, but I'm just saying all the songs I want to play,

230
00:23:04,140 --> 00:23:09,900
what would make me get a guitar, little controller and all that stuff, cause I would never get

231
00:23:09,900 --> 00:23:14,660
a drum set at home type thing, it's just, I just, I really suck at Drummania and it's

232
00:23:14,660 --> 00:23:18,460
not that game I want to get better at.

233
00:23:18,460 --> 00:23:20,140
Good for you, but not for me.

234
00:23:20,140 --> 00:23:21,500
I got it pretty cheap too.

235
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:25,060
guitar freaks is kind of fun I like out I love what I love about guitar freaks

236
00:23:25,060 --> 00:23:28,180
is the cheesy side of me I love how you get bonus points for when you do the

237
00:23:28,180 --> 00:23:32,620
whale like you know lift the guitar up like you're a rock star okay I'm lame

238
00:23:32,620 --> 00:23:44,280
whatever I shoot myself in the head like a rock star but no what else mainly you

239
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:47,500
know in a did school doing a project for my art class it's supposed to be my

240
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:50,500
midterm so we're starting it now because we're not gonna have a test we're just

241
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:56,420
going to do a project. And I have to take, I told you about this earlier, but you take

242
00:23:56,420 --> 00:24:01,820
a picture from a magazine, you have to redo it as a pencil contour drawing, and then redo

243
00:24:01,820 --> 00:24:10,460
it as a ink contour, then do an ink wash version of the picture, ContiCrayon, oil pastel, water

244
00:24:10,460 --> 00:24:19,740
color, there's another one that I'm forgetting, charcoal, which I hate charcoal, and another

245
00:24:19,740 --> 00:24:24,460
version. The same painting over and over. Yeah. And so far I'm almost done with my charcoal

246
00:24:24,460 --> 00:24:31,660
one. My Conti-Cran one's almost done. That leaves me the ink wash, oil pastel, watercolor,

247
00:24:31,660 --> 00:24:38,720
and then the random one. You basically reinvent the picture. I am a horrible, horrible artist.

248
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:44,020
I will never take an art class. It's the one thing I was not meant to do ever in my life

249
00:24:44,020 --> 00:24:50,220
was taken our class. Sorry. I'm helping with the other thing that I brought today. The

250
00:24:50,220 --> 00:24:58,500
other thing that my house has been taken up with has been Dracula X on the TurboDuo. And

251
00:24:58,500 --> 00:25:04,900
I have, for later on today, brought that. Okay, we'll talk about that later. Been doing

252
00:25:04,900 --> 00:25:11,860
lots of retro gaming in the house. We've been playing Tengen Tetris. Why? It sucked. No,

253
00:25:11,860 --> 00:25:18,600
I didn't like it. I did I did not get the big deal with Tang and Tetris. I mean sure it has cooperative place

254
00:25:18,980 --> 00:25:22,140
Okay, I'll give you that it does have the multi the better multiplayer

255
00:25:22,140 --> 00:25:27,780
But the music was better in the Nintendo and the graphics were better and it was cutesier. It was it was Nintendo five

256
00:25:28,340 --> 00:25:34,700
Tang and Tetris had cooperative play which makes it all worth it, but Tang and Tetris outside of that was really ghetto

257
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:41,580
It looked like Commodore 64 Tetris. No, worse. It looked like Atari 800 Tetris.

258
00:25:41,580 --> 00:25:45,860
Well, it was made by Atari. Yeah, and it looked like they took a direct

259
00:25:45,860 --> 00:25:50,060
port from the Atari 800. I mean, it's still cool because it's like,

260
00:25:50,060 --> 00:25:55,500
ooh, the game that was like banned in a court of law, you know, type thing.

261
00:25:55,500 --> 00:25:59,900
They can't make this game anymore. For that reason, it's cool, but still, it's

262
00:25:59,900 --> 00:26:04,660
not the best Tetris game, in my opinion. The one on Game Boy was really the greatest

263
00:26:04,660 --> 00:26:08,660
I'm one of the shining stars of my collection.

264
00:26:08,660 --> 00:26:12,660
Understandable. What about your cartridge of Custer's Revenge?

265
00:26:12,660 --> 00:26:16,660
We don't have a cartridge of Custer's Revenge. You need one.

266
00:26:16,660 --> 00:26:20,660
We've got a ROM of it. Actually, I take that back. We have a ROM chip of it.

267
00:26:20,660 --> 00:26:24,660
Almost, okay, the ROM chip is cool, but as far as the ROM

268
00:26:24,660 --> 00:26:28,660
on the computer goes, almost everybody that's ever emulated Atari 2600

269
00:26:28,660 --> 00:26:32,660
on their PC, the first thing they go and download is Custer's Revenge.

270
00:26:32,660 --> 00:26:34,660
And X-Man.

271
00:26:34,660 --> 00:26:37,660
Custer's Revenge, X-Man, and Adventure.

272
00:26:37,660 --> 00:26:39,660
Or E.T.

273
00:26:39,660 --> 00:26:41,660
E.T. is horrible, I actually own E.T.

274
00:26:41,660 --> 00:26:45,660
Because people usually remember Adventure and E.T. for two very different reasons.

275
00:26:45,660 --> 00:26:47,660
E.T. is the worst game ever.

276
00:26:47,660 --> 00:26:51,660
And Adventure probably for most people the best game ever that they played.

277
00:26:51,660 --> 00:26:53,660
Or Yars' Revenge.

278
00:26:53,660 --> 00:26:57,660
Pac-Man was the second worst game ever.

279
00:26:57,660 --> 00:27:01,660
Isn't that interesting that Yars' Revenge and E.T. had a lot of the same staff?

280
00:27:01,660 --> 00:27:04,660
And one's the worst game ever, and one's the best game ever?

281
00:27:04,660 --> 00:27:07,660
Um, I went to the panel that they did at Classic Gaming Expo.

282
00:27:07,660 --> 00:27:09,660
Oh, I should have gone to that.

283
00:27:09,660 --> 00:27:10,660
A lot of those guys.

284
00:27:10,660 --> 00:27:11,660
Was that this year, or was that last year?

285
00:27:11,660 --> 00:27:12,660
Battlezone, that was this past year.

286
00:27:12,660 --> 00:27:13,660
Was it?

287
00:27:13,660 --> 00:27:17,660
Battlezone, and um, quite a number of other games.

288
00:27:17,660 --> 00:27:18,660
Defender.

289
00:27:18,660 --> 00:27:20,660
That was pretty cool.

290
00:27:22,660 --> 00:27:26,660
But um, yesterday I hung out with Iguana Girl.

291
00:27:26,660 --> 00:27:27,660
We went shopping.

292
00:27:27,660 --> 00:27:29,660
Had dinner.

293
00:27:29,660 --> 00:27:34,660
I burned a bunch, I mean, made pictures of a bunch of DVDs on the night.

294
00:27:34,660 --> 00:27:38,660
I thought she was going to say she burned a bunch of forest or something.

295
00:27:38,660 --> 00:27:40,660
I burned a bunch of people.

296
00:27:40,660 --> 00:27:44,660
And played more of the Final Fantasy game.

297
00:27:44,660 --> 00:27:48,660
Well, you at the mall, I can imagine you wanted to burn down some people.

298
00:27:48,660 --> 00:27:50,660
Did you walk by any girls that were all shopping together?

299
00:27:50,660 --> 00:27:53,660
Oh my god, oh my god, you're going to look so cute in that. Oh my god.

300
00:27:53,660 --> 00:27:56,660
The mall was busy like Christmas busy. It was insane.

301
00:27:56,660 --> 00:28:00,660
It was everyone teaming up for the Super Bowl.

302
00:28:00,660 --> 00:28:04,660
Damn! More of the S-word! The Stupid Bowl!

303
00:28:04,660 --> 00:28:08,660
Here's what it is. Since the Stupid Bowl was going on today,

304
00:28:08,660 --> 00:28:12,660
and all the women knew they'd have to be in the kitchen today, they went to the mall yesterday.

305
00:28:12,660 --> 00:28:16,660
Okay, you know what? This is, you know, the zeroes.

306
00:28:16,660 --> 00:28:20,660
I'm just kidding.

307
00:28:20,660 --> 00:28:24,660
People better get some liberation going on.

308
00:28:24,660 --> 00:28:30,600
nachos get their own damn beer I'm just kidding with you I like getting y'all

309
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:43,080
riled up I like that I like burning a fire on you what what what what what are

310
00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:51,360
you done are you done are you done what hey you

311
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:53,080
You weren't high.

312
00:28:53,080 --> 00:28:55,120
You are high.

313
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:56,120
Anything else?

314
00:28:56,120 --> 00:28:57,280
I'm high on that.

315
00:28:57,280 --> 00:28:58,280
Anything else?

316
00:28:58,280 --> 00:28:59,280
No.

317
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:00,280
Let's keep the show going, people.

318
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:05,600
Oh, other than stupid cookie woman, but I'm bringing that up during the FUs.

319
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:06,600
Stupid cookie woman.

320
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:08,080
Reading about the stupid cookie woman.

321
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:09,680
All right, I'll have to hear about this later.

322
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:12,720
No, it's about the two girls who baked all the cookies for her neighborhood and then

323
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:15,240
the one woman sued them.

324
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:16,560
Huh.

325
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:20,180
I will be discussing that later.

326
00:29:20,180 --> 00:29:24,140
we talk about the stupid Bowl for a minute sure I hate it but go ahead I

327
00:29:24,140 --> 00:29:27,900
well I'm just I'm surprised we have this many people listening tonight with that

328
00:29:27,900 --> 00:29:34,860
whole thing going on but what is your grudge against the stupid Bowl Jamie it's

329
00:29:34,860 --> 00:29:40,820
like a bastardized version of rugby at least rugby has men getting bloody

330
00:29:40,820 --> 00:29:50,980
wearing shorts big advantages there real football soccer and on top of that it's

331
00:29:50,980 --> 00:29:54,820
just another excuse for millions and millions of Americans to sit on their

332
00:29:54,820 --> 00:30:00,380
lazy asses drink beer and scream obscenities at their TV that's a

333
00:30:00,380 --> 00:30:03,240
different than the other Sunday night yeah I was gonna say instead we

334
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:10,060
encourage you to we are encouraging our listeners to sit home drink juice and

335
00:30:10,060 --> 00:30:15,640
and uh... sit and listen to obscenities be screamed at them

336
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:18,280
you know if i was one screaming the obscenities at them that would be

337
00:30:18,280 --> 00:30:20,200
worthwhile

338
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:24,500
what's stopping you

339
00:30:24,500 --> 00:30:26,480
i need a really big megaphone

340
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:30,040
you're not even into the uh... commercials at all

341
00:30:30,040 --> 00:30:31,220
no cause they're stupid

342
00:30:31,220 --> 00:30:32,900
and uh...

343
00:30:32,900 --> 00:30:36,320
the halftime show the wardrobe malfunctions no

344
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:38,380
no this year was Paul McCartney

345
00:30:38,380 --> 00:30:40,380
I would have watched that.

346
00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:43,380
Yeah, if he had a wardrobe malfunction, I'm sure there would have been coverage.

347
00:30:43,380 --> 00:30:45,380
I'm sure his wife would have been.

348
00:30:45,380 --> 00:30:51,380
Can you imagine Paul McCartney like having a wardrobe malfunction where like a ball falls out or something?

349
00:30:51,380 --> 00:30:53,380
That's disgusting!

350
00:30:53,380 --> 00:30:54,380
I seriously doubt it.

351
00:30:54,380 --> 00:30:57,380
I would petition the FCC myself.

352
00:30:57,380 --> 00:31:04,380
I bet you Saturday Live is going to get him next time and he's going to have a wardrobe malfunction like Janet where his shirt rips off or something.

353
00:31:04,380 --> 00:31:06,380
That's disgusting.

354
00:31:06,380 --> 00:31:12,580
shirt ripped off? What? Uh-oh. You broke something, you fixed it.

355
00:31:12,580 --> 00:31:15,980
My previous... Well, are you done? Are you done?

356
00:31:15,980 --> 00:31:20,100
I guess so! Well, are you done?

357
00:31:20,100 --> 00:31:27,100
I guess so. Fine. I guess I'll go then.

358
00:31:27,140 --> 00:31:32,140
You're done since you said you're done. I just said I guess so, I didn't say I was

359
00:31:32,140 --> 00:31:35,740
done. See, this is my pet peeve about women. They

360
00:31:35,740 --> 00:31:39,740
They don't fucking come out and say yes or no. They always have to go, maybe.

361
00:31:39,740 --> 00:31:43,740
Fine! I'm done!

362
00:31:43,740 --> 00:31:47,740
Speak!

363
00:31:47,740 --> 00:31:51,740
Anyways, I just fixed the monitor because it wasn't working.

364
00:31:51,740 --> 00:31:55,740
And my previous assumption of there's two sets of cords going

365
00:31:55,740 --> 00:31:59,740
to the screen, and I thought one of them was for the standard

366
00:31:59,740 --> 00:32:03,740
composite input. You have to set up your story because you can't

367
00:32:03,740 --> 00:32:05,740
I can't assume that every-

368
00:32:05,740 --> 00:32:07,740
I was getting there, okay?

369
00:32:07,740 --> 00:32:09,740
Alright, alright.

370
00:32:09,740 --> 00:32:11,740
Anyway.

371
00:32:11,740 --> 00:32:13,740
It worked exactly like I thought.

372
00:32:13,740 --> 00:32:15,740
So when I unplugged something, it worked perfectly.

373
00:32:15,740 --> 00:32:19,740
So, now the monitor works and I'm happy.

374
00:32:19,740 --> 00:32:23,740
But because I tried cutting something off of the Dremel tool, I accidentally grinded something out.

375
00:32:23,740 --> 00:32:28,740
So anyways, the monitor thing, this is for that computer that I'm building that's inside of an Xbox.

376
00:32:28,740 --> 00:32:38,740
The monitor itself is a old PlayStation 1 monitor, LCD thing, that's like 5 inch, and right now we have the TurboDuo on there, so...

377
00:32:38,740 --> 00:32:42,740
Are we gonna be able to play Final Fantasy XI on it?

378
00:32:42,740 --> 00:32:50,740
Um, you know, to be honest, I could do that, but not on that computer. You're not gonna be able to play Final Fantasy XI on that computer.

379
00:32:50,740 --> 00:32:51,740
No!

380
00:32:51,740 --> 00:32:54,740
That computer is way too weak.

381
00:32:54,740 --> 00:33:02,740
You can play Final Fantasy on the emulator, Final Fantasy 3, or 6.

382
00:33:02,740 --> 00:33:04,740
Hurray.

383
00:33:04,740 --> 00:33:08,740
You can play Fantasy Star Online.

384
00:33:08,740 --> 00:33:12,740
I don't even know if the computer is powerful enough to handle that. Probably not.

385
00:33:12,740 --> 00:33:16,740
It's only like, what, 1 gigahertz? So.

386
00:33:16,740 --> 00:33:19,740
I'll be lucky if I can play Leisure Suit Larry on it.

387
00:33:19,740 --> 00:33:23,740
Oh, you can play the original one. That's nothing.

388
00:33:23,740 --> 00:33:26,500
Yeah, so that's what I've been working on for the last few days

389
00:33:29,280 --> 00:33:31,840
The rest of the week was me being sick and

390
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:41,180
Just playing a lot of Final Fantasy we went to the buffet yesterday and that was fun because I hadn't been there and

391
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:45,920
What else oh

392
00:33:47,020 --> 00:33:50,240
That's pretty much it just people quitting at my work now

393
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:56,420
that's funny because they're going to be screwed and I don't care and yeah it's

394
00:33:56,420 --> 00:34:02,400
just that kind of thing that's all that happened to me all righty let's hear

395
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:08,320
from DDR angel how was your week how's your day not much just a lot of school

396
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:13,200
and homework and you know the usual stuff working and running into creepy

397
00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:19,000
guys it fries on Tuesday nights yes running into you know actually it was

398
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:32,000
It was kind of funny, I went over to Fry's on Tuesday and aside from watching 23rd Magus play DDR, again, because he always has to stop there for some reason just to show off or whatever.

399
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:35,000
Okay, not really show off, just play.

400
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:44,000
So, I was looking for a new speaker set and just some other stuff that I needed and I ran into BUGS! And that was fun.

401
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,000
Yes, and I recovered perfectly fine, thank you.

402
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:49,000
What did I do? I did nothing!

403
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:50,000
Yeah, you said you ran into me.

404
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,000
Yes, I did. No, no, no, no, no.

405
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,000
That would be 23rd Magus running into you.

406
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,000
Puppy porn? What?

407
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,000
I don't want to know, okay, um...

408
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,000
It's the puppy bowl!

409
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:00,000
...sidebar conversation edit now. Okay.

410
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,000
Puppies don't have bowls?

411
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,000
Um, not much other than that.

412
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:07,000
I really wish that I could play, uh, Pwner Finishing Alert this week, but, um...

413
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:11,000
Homework kind of got into the way, uh, into the way and all that stuff.

414
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:15,000
So, this week hopefully I will get things done, um...

415
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:21,460
probably tonight or tomorrow and then I can play with everyone yay and that'd be

416
00:35:21,460 --> 00:35:25,580
it be gentle when you play with all of us

417
00:35:26,580 --> 00:35:30,580
how was your week how was your day I ran into this creepy person at fries on

418
00:35:30,580 --> 00:35:42,260
Tuesday night I'm not creepy I'm angelic I wasn't talking about you he's creepy

419
00:35:42,260 --> 00:35:48,260
He gave me this weird eye, like damn I know you. I gave him the weird eye, like I do know you.

420
00:35:48,260 --> 00:35:54,260
Well, I would call it something, but then... yeah. Never mind.

421
00:35:54,260 --> 00:35:57,260
I'll just call it the eyebrow.

422
00:36:00,260 --> 00:36:03,260
Anyway, other than that, how was your week in the day?

423
00:36:03,260 --> 00:36:09,260
I ended up in San Jose yesterday for a birthday party. Lots of video games and other various games.

424
00:36:09,260 --> 00:36:10,260
Yes, how did that go?

425
00:36:10,260 --> 00:36:14,820
that went pretty well. Mm-hmm. And got back at like 2 a.m. beat my brother home.

426
00:36:14,820 --> 00:36:20,220
It was working. Uh-huh. He kind of, he was kind of surprised to see his big brother

427
00:36:20,220 --> 00:36:24,060
sitting at the computer in the kitchen when he walked in at 3 a.m. Can't blame

428
00:36:24,060 --> 00:36:27,500
him. I'd be surprised too if somebody was sitting at the computer in my kitchen at

429
00:36:27,500 --> 00:36:35,240
3 a.m. And, let's see. Picked up two video games today. The toy locator store over at the

430
00:36:35,240 --> 00:36:39,560
outlets had buy one get one fifty percent off so I got

431
00:36:39,560 --> 00:36:43,080
Civ III and Douglas Adams Titanic

432
00:36:43,080 --> 00:36:46,480
two games I've really wanted to play for a long time

433
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:50,360
now I can actually afford them. I'm curious about Civ III like I haven't

434
00:36:50,360 --> 00:36:51,040
really played it

435
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:55,280
Oh well, if you want to give it a test drive. Yeah, I might have to try that out

436
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:58,760
I heard that Civ III was

437
00:36:58,760 --> 00:37:03,400
a little more like Civ I than Civ II was because Civ II was too much for me

438
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:09,320
like I, oh my god, like it's too complicated. Sim 1's bad enough, but Sim 2 is like, oh

439
00:37:09,320 --> 00:37:14,320
my god! But somebody told me that Sim 3 is a little, a little easier, but I hope that's

440
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:19,840
true. Nothing beats Populous though. Populous was cool because you could drown people by

441
00:37:19,840 --> 00:37:25,320
just taking away all the land. If you guys have never played Populous, check it out sometime,

442
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:28,580
seriously. But it was out for what, SNES? Yeah, it was out on Super, I owned it on Super

443
00:37:28,580 --> 00:37:31,920
Nintendo, okay? I thought we had it for the computer as well. Yeah, it was out on the

444
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:36,940
the computer as well. It was really a computer game too. It was one of those games that some

445
00:37:36,940 --> 00:37:41,320
genius decided they were going to port from PC to Super Nintendo. Although the game really,

446
00:37:41,320 --> 00:37:47,100
really was not designed to be played on the console. But you tried anyway. And that's

447
00:37:47,100 --> 00:37:51,780
how it was on Super Nintendo. The game was awesome. Drowning your own people are the

448
00:37:51,780 --> 00:37:56,460
best. My week's been pretty damn boring. And Tuesday is going to be a very interesting

449
00:37:56,460 --> 00:38:03,620
day with the funeral. A lot of people from the past life have come out of the woodwork.

450
00:38:03,620 --> 00:38:09,620
That's tomorrow? Tuesday. Tuesday. I, well, yeah. Your work. I'll talk to you, well, yeah,

451
00:38:09,620 --> 00:38:18,620
there's that and, you know, I just, I don't like funerals. I really, really don't, so,

452
00:38:18,620 --> 00:38:23,620
But other than that, nope, which is pretty standard.

453
00:38:23,620 --> 00:38:25,620
Alright, fair enough.

454
00:38:25,620 --> 00:38:27,620
My week and my day, I guess it's my turn.

455
00:38:27,620 --> 00:38:29,620
Okay, I want to expand on the buffet thing.

456
00:38:29,620 --> 00:38:32,620
We went to Thunder Valley Casino, which is this little Indian casino.

457
00:38:32,620 --> 00:38:33,620
Well, it's not really little.

458
00:38:33,620 --> 00:38:39,620
It's this big Indian casino that is somewhere between here, where we are in Sacramento,

459
00:38:39,620 --> 00:38:43,620
and Reno, which is where all the gambling used to happen.

460
00:38:43,620 --> 00:38:47,620
But now that they have this new Indian casino, that's where everybody in this area goes to gamble,

461
00:38:47,620 --> 00:38:51,700
Reno is practically going bankrupt because of it but I went there and they

462
00:38:51,700 --> 00:38:58,560
have this huge buffet it's so good and I swear that the buffet at a place like

463
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:02,240
that is the only place where you could just get like like Loki brought back a

464
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:08,500
dish from the buffet he had egg flour soup and two two pieces of corn from the

465
00:39:08,500 --> 00:39:12,580
buffet and I'm just like only only at a buffet like I brought back one plate

466
00:39:12,580 --> 00:39:18,500
that had like this really good tortellini on it, and coconut shrimp. And I think my

467
00:39:18,500 --> 00:39:23,420
buddy Christopher put it best, the coconut shrimp tasted like a Krispy Kreme donut. It

468
00:39:23,420 --> 00:39:27,660
was so good. And I love coconut shrimp, I had so much coconut yesterday, I had that,

469
00:39:27,660 --> 00:39:31,860
and I had a coconut cream pie. Sorry, am I making you guys hungry? I'm sorry. I ate so

470
00:39:31,860 --> 00:39:41,420
much, I was so full. And then I lost $75 in the casino. Go me, I rock. And, Loki, how

471
00:39:41,420 --> 00:39:46,500
How long would you say it took me to lose $75?

472
00:39:46,500 --> 00:39:47,500
About ten minutes.

473
00:39:47,500 --> 00:39:48,500
About ten minutes.

474
00:39:48,500 --> 00:39:53,440
Cause I play quarters and dollars.

475
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:55,420
I don't stick around for that nickel stuff.

476
00:39:55,420 --> 00:39:56,420
That ain't gambling.

477
00:39:56,420 --> 00:39:57,420
That's just...

478
00:39:57,420 --> 00:39:59,420
That's how you don't lose $75.

479
00:39:59,420 --> 00:40:03,980
Cause a buck gets you twenty plays.

480
00:40:03,980 --> 00:40:08,140
Oh, for a nickel, well, see, no, no, no.

481
00:40:08,140 --> 00:40:10,500
Because on nickel machines, this actually, you know what?

482
00:40:10,500 --> 00:40:13,980
can relate this to Bimani because a lot of those nickel machines are built by

483
00:40:13,980 --> 00:40:17,220
Konami. You may not know this but Konami actually has a lot of these machines as

484
00:40:17,220 --> 00:40:21,060
well and the deal with is that a lot of the nickel machines that are out there

485
00:40:21,060 --> 00:40:25,900
are actually video slot machines and the way they're built they have five reels

486
00:40:25,900 --> 00:40:31,380
and when you put that you can play them nine different ways it's like you could

487
00:40:31,380 --> 00:40:35,580
play it straight across you could play it diagonally bouncing around this way

488
00:40:35,580 --> 00:40:40,180
and that way and like making little mountains and valleys it's crazy all the

489
00:40:40,180 --> 00:40:43,900
different line patterns that you can have when you play on a nickel slot

490
00:40:43,900 --> 00:40:48,220
machine so if you want to play all nine ways on the nickel slot you're really

491
00:40:48,220 --> 00:40:56,860
spending 50 cents a pull but that's crap because that stuff is programmed only

492
00:40:56,860 --> 00:41:00,980
spit out so I hate playing nickel slots to be honest there's actually more than

493
00:41:00,980 --> 00:41:04,460
five arrows so it's better than pump up

494
00:41:04,460 --> 00:41:09,460
Did you say you wanted me back for my witty remarks?

495
00:41:09,460 --> 00:41:10,460
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

496
00:41:10,460 --> 00:41:11,460
Man, look what you got yourself into.

497
00:41:11,460 --> 00:41:12,460
I'm starting to reconsider that thought.

498
00:41:12,460 --> 00:41:14,460
What's up with my bass?

499
00:41:14,460 --> 00:41:16,460
And then, what else was there?

500
00:41:16,460 --> 00:41:21,460
There was the buffet yesterday and I was going to talk about something else I can't remember.

501
00:41:21,460 --> 00:41:23,460
I guess I had a pretty good week otherwise.

502
00:41:23,460 --> 00:41:25,460
Pretty mellow.

503
00:41:25,460 --> 00:41:26,460
I didn't do a lot.

504
00:41:26,460 --> 00:41:27,460
I was sick Wednesday.

505
00:41:27,460 --> 00:41:28,460
I didn't go to work.

506
00:41:28,460 --> 00:41:30,460
And so, you know, that's kind of a bummer.

507
00:41:30,460 --> 00:41:34,020
Don't drink on weeknights, kids.

508
00:41:34,020 --> 00:41:37,740
This is something I learned. Don't drink on a weeknight.

509
00:41:37,740 --> 00:41:41,140
Yeah, don't overdrink on a weeknight. Don't do it without a plan.

510
00:41:41,140 --> 00:41:45,060
Don't take seven shots of straight up rum on a weeknight within the scope of an

511
00:41:45,060 --> 00:41:45,500
hour.

512
00:41:45,500 --> 00:41:49,740
You know, that wouldn't stop me.

513
00:41:49,740 --> 00:41:53,340
Don't do that at any time.

514
00:41:53,340 --> 00:41:58,500
Seriously, if I ever do that again, I'm checking myself into AA or something

515
00:41:58,500 --> 00:42:03,260
and I'm not into those 12-step programs. I'm a one-step program kind of person. I'm no

516
00:42:03,260 --> 00:42:09,580
more drinking on weeknights period. Step one, remove cap. Step two, take shot glass. That's

517
00:42:09,580 --> 00:42:19,300
your 12-step program. Pour liquor. Step four, drink. Step five, fuck the other steps. I

518
00:42:19,300 --> 00:42:25,540
have a two-step program, over the tracks, brewery. You live right near him? Yes. For

519
00:42:25,540 --> 00:42:27,540
For those that don't know, you live near a brewery.

520
00:42:27,540 --> 00:42:29,540
I don't even know that I live near a brewery.

521
00:42:29,540 --> 00:42:31,540
How the hell am I going to tell anyone else?

522
00:42:31,540 --> 00:42:35,540
I've got to come out there sometime. It's just weeknight, drive...

523
00:42:35,540 --> 00:42:36,540
Drive with someone.

524
00:42:36,540 --> 00:42:39,540
I know, I will. Someday.

525
00:42:39,540 --> 00:42:41,540
Take the train.

526
00:42:41,540 --> 00:42:42,540
Someday.

527
00:42:42,540 --> 00:42:46,540
I guess that's it for now. If I think there's something else exciting, I'll tell you guys about it later.

528
00:42:46,540 --> 00:42:48,540
But gambling was a highlight of my weekend. What?

529
00:42:51,540 --> 00:42:52,540
No.

530
00:42:52,540 --> 00:42:58,540
I didn't. I was antisocial this weekend. I was very antisocial this weekend.

531
00:42:58,540 --> 00:43:02,540
That's kind of the theme of my whole week, was antisocialness. That's alright.

532
00:43:02,540 --> 00:43:09,540
Alright, you guys are sick of hearing about us, I'm sure. We're going to come back, we're going to take a break, we're going to come back and we're going to talk about some Bomani news going on out there right now.

533
00:43:09,540 --> 00:43:17,540
We've got some news on 2DX Nightstyle going on, and we've got some news on UltraMix 2, kind of, sorta.

534
00:43:17,540 --> 00:43:23,540
Even though the game's already out, we have some more news on Ultramix 2 that's all been developing throughout today, in fact.

535
00:43:23,540 --> 00:43:30,540
No Song Pack 8 yet, and all sorts of other stuff that we can come up with.

536
00:43:30,540 --> 00:43:32,540
Plus, Jamie has something she wants to share with you guys, too.

537
00:43:32,540 --> 00:43:40,540
I'm not really sure how we're going to do this on air, how this is going to translate to radio, but you seem to have something already planned, Jamie, for our listeners.

538
00:43:40,540 --> 00:43:41,540
Webcam.

539
00:43:41,540 --> 00:43:42,540
And it's a follow-up to last week, right?

540
00:43:42,540 --> 00:43:43,540
Yeah, it's a follow-up to last week.

541
00:43:43,540 --> 00:43:48,240
last week. I'm glad you brought up the webcam. www.orangelaungeradio.com and you can see

542
00:43:48,240 --> 00:43:51,820
our webcam. Also, don't forget to join our chat room while you're there and we are a

543
00:43:51,820 --> 00:43:54,860
fully interactive program. Check out the Skype line while you're there as well. Click on

00:43:54,860 --> 00:43:58,560

545
00:43:58,560 --> 00:44:04,420

546
00:44:04,420 --> 00:44:11,420
we get back from this break, announcement. Big, huge Orange Launch Radio announcement

547
00:44:11,420 --> 00:44:15,580
though could change the future of everything as we know it

548
00:44:15,580 --> 00:44:18,840
will be back after this

549
00:44:18,840 --> 00:44:22,300
yes somebody's going to be fired for doing something about alright

550
00:44:22,300 --> 00:44:25,700
uh... more two d x red music in this break starting off with a little bit of

551
00:44:25,700 --> 00:44:32,700
of Akira Yamaoka. Thank you very much. We'll be back.

552
00:45:55,700 --> 00:46:02,700
It's been long since we've been together

553
00:46:02,700 --> 00:46:08,700
Even though we've been together

554
00:46:08,700 --> 00:46:16,700
We've been together since we've been together

555
00:48:16,700 --> 00:48:18,700
Come on

556
00:49:46,700 --> 00:49:47,700
Hey!

557
00:49:47,700 --> 00:49:48,700
Hey!

558
00:49:48,700 --> 00:49:49,700
Hey!

559
00:49:49,700 --> 00:49:50,700
Hey!

560
00:50:20,700 --> 00:50:21,700
Hey!

561
00:50:24,700 --> 00:50:25,700
Hey!

562
00:50:55,700 --> 00:50:59,700
the

563
00:50:59,700 --> 00:51:03,700
the

564
00:51:03,700 --> 00:51:07,700
the

565
00:51:07,700 --> 00:51:11,700
the

566
00:51:11,700 --> 00:51:15,700
the

567
00:51:15,700 --> 00:51:19,700
the

568
00:51:19,700 --> 00:51:23,700
the

569
00:52:23,700 --> 00:52:49,980
We

570
00:52:49,980 --> 00:52:53,100
are back here on Orange Lounge Radio.

571
00:52:53,100 --> 00:52:58,160
you enjoyed that break of some 2DX Red music. Now that the OST is out, you can really take

572
00:52:58,160 --> 00:53:03,980
a second look at a lot of those songs. It really just shows you how much the quality

573
00:53:03,980 --> 00:53:09,900
of an MP3 or quality of a rip can really affect the way you perceive a song. For instance,

574
00:53:09,900 --> 00:53:15,140
what would be a song? Well, I would say EVO66 was one of those songs. We played that one

575
00:53:15,140 --> 00:53:18,740
a little bit earlier in the show. That was one of those songs that I just, when I heard

576
00:53:18,740 --> 00:53:23,300
the soundboard rip, or the one from the game, I was just kind of like, oh, this sounds okay.

577
00:53:23,300 --> 00:53:26,940
But then, like, when I was listening to the soundtrack on, I was like, oh, this is kind

578
00:53:26,940 --> 00:53:30,500
of groovy. Like, it really, you know, it kind of thumps a lot more. I guess because you

579
00:53:30,500 --> 00:53:33,620
get more of the bass and the fullness of the sound. Like, this is a really, like, thumping

580
00:53:33,620 --> 00:53:38,860
song. And considering I live too far away from any 2DX Red machines, so I haven't really

581
00:53:38,860 --> 00:53:43,660
gotten to play the actual machine, this is the only way I kind of get to live 2DX Red.

582
00:53:43,660 --> 00:53:44,660
Where are they around here?

583
00:54:13,660 --> 00:54:42,300
I don't know. Pause it for a minute. Stop for a minute. Okay, because you just played

584
00:54:42,300 --> 00:54:47,280
the Soundtrack 1 side-by-side. Okay, it probably is not going to translate well, though, over

585
00:54:47,280 --> 00:54:50,520
our stream, because our stream is for dial-up radio, so I don't think you're going to get

586
00:54:50,520 --> 00:54:54,940
the same quality there, because you're probably like, that sounds the same to me. Probably

587
00:54:54,940 --> 00:54:59,380
does. But here's the thing, is that, for those of us in studio, we can hear it a little more.

588
00:54:59,380 --> 00:55:03,040
You really can hear a lot more of the stereo effects, I think, and just kind of like the

589
00:55:03,040 --> 00:55:07,240
fullness of the instruments. I don't know, it makes a big difference to me. It's huge.

590
00:55:07,240 --> 00:55:11,640
It's like the difference, it's like when somebody rips an MP3 at 112 and 192.

591
00:55:11,640 --> 00:55:15,040
Sure, it sounds just fine at 112, you can understand everything perfectly,

592
00:55:15,040 --> 00:55:17,240
but at 192 it's like, oh my god.

593
00:55:17,240 --> 00:55:20,240
It sounds just like the CD.

594
00:55:20,240 --> 00:55:22,240
Anyway.

595
00:55:22,240 --> 00:55:25,240
Um, let's see, what else was I gonna bring up here?

596
00:55:25,240 --> 00:55:28,640
Uh, big news for Orange Lounge Radio.

597
00:55:28,640 --> 00:55:34,540
I don't wanna spill too much, however sometime before the end of the month,

598
00:55:34,540 --> 00:55:38,540
We're officially going to be making some big changes to the station.

599
00:55:38,540 --> 00:55:40,540
Big changes.

600
00:55:40,540 --> 00:55:42,540
Yeah, we're firing Loki.

601
00:55:44,540 --> 00:55:47,540
He's just too angry. No, of course we're not firing Loki.

602
00:55:47,540 --> 00:55:49,540
We're cloning Rob.

603
00:55:49,540 --> 00:55:51,540
Something will be leaving the station, however.

604
00:55:51,540 --> 00:55:54,540
Something's leaving. Something's coming.

605
00:55:54,540 --> 00:55:56,540
Instead, it's going to be interesting.

606
00:55:56,540 --> 00:55:58,540
Maybe you're cocky?

607
00:55:59,540 --> 00:56:03,540
I don't want to say too much more, but we're going to freshen up Orange Lounge a little bit.

608
00:56:03,540 --> 00:56:07,560
just said that Orange Lawn is getting too stale. We're gonna freshen things up around

609
00:56:07,560 --> 00:56:11,500
here a little bit. So the... FDS? We don't have an official... Yeah, we're gonna spray

610
00:56:11,500 --> 00:56:23,000
some FDS on our station. Cause it needs it. But we'll announce an official date soon.

611
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:27,120
So stay tuned to our website, orangelawnjr.com for more details. We can just go ahead and

612
00:56:27,120 --> 00:56:31,720
tell them that we were finally bought out by Sirius Broadcasting and our... Actually

613
00:56:31,720 --> 00:56:37,080
The Comcast bought us, and starting next week we're going to be called G4 Orange Lounge

614
00:56:37,080 --> 00:56:38,080
Radio.

615
00:56:38,080 --> 00:56:39,080
G4 Orange Lounge.

616
00:56:39,080 --> 00:56:44,060
Yeah, yeah, we're G4 Orange Lounge.

617
00:56:44,060 --> 00:56:48,200
And then in three weeks, they'll just be G4 again.

618
00:56:48,200 --> 00:56:52,600
With all the original content removed.

619
00:56:52,600 --> 00:56:58,300
Yeah, except all of us will have been fired and like, you know, maybe the F.U.'s segment

620
00:56:58,300 --> 00:56:59,300
is still intact.

621
00:56:59,300 --> 00:57:00,300
That'll be the one thing they keep.

622
00:57:00,300 --> 00:57:21,300
And all of us will be replaced by busty Asian chicks and American Idol rejects, and that'll be it. We'll be a great radio station to look at.

623
00:57:21,300 --> 00:57:23,300
Dude, what else could we bash about G4?

624
00:57:23,300 --> 00:57:30,300
Dude, you know what? I would be on the Busty Asian Chick show because I can appreciate their talents.

625
00:57:30,300 --> 00:57:32,300
Are you a Busty Asian Chick?

626
00:57:32,300 --> 00:57:39,300
Who knows, guys? I said something new's coming to Orange Lounge Radio this month. Maybe the Busty Asian Chick show. We'll see.

627
00:57:39,300 --> 00:57:44,300
Hey, Loki needs a spin-off show.

628
00:57:48,300 --> 00:57:53,300
You should put an ad in the paper, try to get some busty Asian chicks over here once a week, and just talk.

629
00:57:56,300 --> 00:57:58,300
So, how are they doing today?

630
00:58:01,300 --> 00:58:04,300
Good, good. That's right, bounce a little bit.

631
00:58:04,300 --> 00:58:07,740
hmm yeah

632
00:58:07,740 --> 00:58:10,580
today we're gonna play some DDR

633
00:58:10,580 --> 00:58:13,620
yeah it'll be great radio, Loki, it'll be excellent radio

634
00:58:13,620 --> 00:58:15,060
just so I can point out

635
00:58:15,060 --> 00:58:18,820
I know the folks at home can't see her naked light riding around on the

636
00:58:18,820 --> 00:58:22,440
DDR pad but I can guarantee that she's doing it

637
00:58:22,440 --> 00:58:23,500
yeah

638
00:58:23,500 --> 00:58:26,260
go for that triple A

639
00:58:26,260 --> 00:58:27,660
slower

640
00:58:27,660 --> 00:58:28,260
slower

641
00:58:28,260 --> 00:58:32,980
this is why radio porn never took off

642
00:58:32,980 --> 00:58:37,020
yet yet radio on the fire radio on the phone sex on the phone is still do you

643
00:58:37,020 --> 00:58:38,420
know interactive

644
00:58:38,420 --> 00:58:40,800
by direction

645
00:58:40,800 --> 00:58:42,980
where an interactive program

646
00:58:42,980 --> 00:58:48,700
yes skype sex

647
00:58:48,700 --> 00:58:50,000
program

648
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:52,860
all right move right along

649
00:58:52,860 --> 00:58:57,740
time out some stuff going on in the money world uh...

650
00:58:57,740 --> 00:58:59,200
i was going to point this out

651
00:58:59,200 --> 00:59:04,200
There's an interesting thread going on over on DDRFreak right now, and it has to do with Ultramix 2.

652
00:59:06,200 --> 00:59:14,200
And, uh, one of the moderators over there, Cutris, noticed that there was a lot of stuff going on with the website.

653
00:59:14,200 --> 00:59:21,200
That there was a pattern to the way all these images, the images, the song images, were put on the site.

654
00:59:21,200 --> 00:59:28,460
So, I'm not sure what inspired him to do it, but he wrote a Perl script that will check

655
00:59:28,460 --> 00:59:33,100
for the existence of every possible song banner, because basically every song banner on the

656
00:59:33,100 --> 00:59:41,840
site is four letters, underscore, T-H. So he wrote this script that will scan everything

657
00:59:41,840 --> 00:59:46,060
on the site and put in all these different combinations of letters. And he noticed that

658
00:59:46,060 --> 00:59:53,500
if you put in CRZY underscore th it actually pulls up a banner and it's not

659
00:59:53,500 --> 00:59:59,280
this is on the Konami of Hawaii site it's actually a banner that says crazy

660
00:59:59,280 --> 01:00:06,360
and love by Beyonce and it's got its own cute little artsy pattern so what the

661
01:00:06,360 --> 01:00:10,840
hell's the song banner doing on Konami of Hawaii site don't know nobody's

662
01:00:10,840 --> 01:00:14,840
I guess like White and Apple have a PowerBook G5 link.

663
01:00:40,840 --> 01:00:42,440
Are you guys still on IRC?

664
01:00:42,440 --> 01:00:43,440
No, there was a big split.

665
01:00:43,440 --> 01:00:46,840
Oh, I got kicked from chat completely, so I'll try to get back in.

666
01:00:46,840 --> 01:00:52,840
Could it be that they were songs that were supposed to be there and now they're not there anymore?

667
01:00:52,840 --> 01:00:55,040
Don't know, but they're on the site.

668
01:00:55,040 --> 01:00:59,040
That's not the only one, there's more songs.

669
01:00:59,040 --> 01:01:05,740
Including Boom Boom Dollar, the KOG G3 mix by King Kong D Jungle Girls.

670
01:01:05,740 --> 01:01:07,840
You know, that was the one in third mix, the speed one.

671
01:01:07,840 --> 01:01:11,560
Hold On Me. That was the Para Para song that was in DDR Extreme.

672
01:01:11,560 --> 01:01:14,880
I love that song. And then there's also a song banner that was found

673
01:01:14,880 --> 01:01:20,620
In My Dreams by Nomi. That's a licensed song you guys. It's not the same In My

674
01:01:20,620 --> 01:01:22,160
Dreams that was in

675
01:01:22,160 --> 01:01:25,840
Dance Maniacs but it's actually

676
01:01:25,840 --> 01:01:30,360
a commercial song and aren't you lucky I have a little clip of it actually

677
01:01:30,360 --> 01:01:36,800
if I can find it.

678
01:01:36,800 --> 01:01:39,800
I'm looking right now. I know I had it somewhere.

679
01:01:39,800 --> 01:01:41,800
Here's a little clip of that song.

680
01:01:41,800 --> 01:01:43,800
Because some folks even on the thread were asking,

681
01:01:43,800 --> 01:01:44,800
what in the hell is that song?

682
01:01:44,800 --> 01:01:46,800
This is it. This is In My Dreams by Nomi.

683
01:02:14,800 --> 01:02:27,480
So, interesting that Banners exists not just for that song, but for the Crazy in Love Beyonce,

684
01:02:27,480 --> 01:02:33,400
yet neither one appears to have any connection to Ultra Mix 2.

685
01:02:33,400 --> 01:02:35,600
How do you think to do something like that?

686
01:02:35,600 --> 01:02:38,320
I gotta hand it to Cutris.

687
01:02:38,320 --> 01:02:43,500
I mean sure I've heard of scanning directories to see if there's files in there that aren't

688
01:02:43,500 --> 01:02:48,400
linked or something like that. But to figure out that, gee, there's a pattern, maybe there's

689
01:02:48,400 --> 01:02:52,120
songs missing. I guess maybe what he was doing is he was trying to look for the banners for

690
01:02:52,120 --> 01:02:56,960
Song Pack 8, maybe. I'm thinking maybe that was it, and then stumbled across this instead.

691
01:02:56,960 --> 01:03:07,240
I don't know, but hats off to him. Crazy. Anyway. So, more to develop on now. I guess

692
01:03:07,240 --> 01:03:15,400
we will see what happens. Are they going to end up in a song pack? Who knows? Alright.

693
01:03:15,400 --> 01:03:24,000
Moving on. I also want to talk about something that's going on with BeatMania 2DX Night Style

694
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:30,780
Consumer. That's a big thing that's going on right now. This is interesting is that

695
01:03:30,780 --> 01:03:35,520
Night Style is going to be coming out next month, but there's going to be, get this,

696
01:03:35,520 --> 01:03:40,380
Seven different ways to buy 2DX for Ninth Style.

697
01:03:40,380 --> 01:03:45,080
Seven different packages that Konami Style is putting out.

698
01:03:45,080 --> 01:03:52,700
Ninth Style plus a benefit CD, a Visual Emotions 2 DVD that you can just buy by itself.

699
01:03:52,700 --> 01:03:57,520
Ninth Style plus the CD plus Visual Emotions 2 plus a poster.

700
01:03:57,520 --> 01:03:59,320
That's going to run you about a hundred bucks.

701
01:03:59,320 --> 01:04:03,820
Ninth Style plus a benefit CD plus V-Rare 10 plus poster.

702
01:04:03,820 --> 01:04:12,820
And then, just all these combinations. There's Visual Emotions 2, Poster, V-Rare 10, and then all these goodies.

703
01:04:12,820 --> 01:04:17,820
My gosh, there's a gazillion different ways you can buy this. It almost sounds like something Nintendo would do.

704
01:04:17,820 --> 01:04:26,820
And there's the one at the bottom there, Night Style, Benefit CD, V-Rare 10, member of B4U, and a poster.

705
01:04:26,820 --> 01:04:29,820
And that's gonna run you about 200.

706
01:04:29,820 --> 01:04:37,020
Yes, you can actually buy yourself, buy yourself a member of B4U.

707
01:04:37,020 --> 01:04:38,020
That's lovely.

708
01:04:38,020 --> 01:04:39,020
Is it torture?

709
01:04:39,020 --> 01:04:47,940
It sounds like something that, yes, there's a keychain.

710
01:04:47,940 --> 01:04:52,900
Translation that was posted to the live journal community, BM underscore 2DX, this is very

711
01:04:52,900 --> 01:04:53,900
nice.

712
01:04:53,900 --> 01:04:58,620
B-Mania 2DX it seems in order to put out, it is the portable strap which finishes the

713
01:04:58,620 --> 01:05:02,700
The whole, remember this is English here, with the metal material and the good set which

714
01:05:02,700 --> 01:05:06,260
designs the various designs of 2DX as the sticker.

715
01:05:06,260 --> 01:05:09,680
The metal portable strap, the mark of 2DX stamped in the metal plate.

716
01:05:09,680 --> 01:05:14,880
In addition, the yearning AAA mark of the user is stamped on plate back.

717
01:05:14,880 --> 01:05:19,320
So in other words, they're going to have this kind of AAA keychain it sounds like.

718
01:05:19,320 --> 01:05:23,480
Some of the songs that are going to be on Visual Emotions 2, some of the videos that

719
01:05:23,480 --> 01:05:30,480
going to be on it. Doll, Lucy, Space Fight, Quasar, so a lot of the newer songs. But then

720
01:05:30,480 --> 01:05:35,600
it kind of goes back to some of the old ones, too. Summer Vacation, 2DX, the song from,

721
01:05:35,600 --> 01:05:43,240
what, Fifth Style, Burn in the Floor, Leading Cyber. Doesn't this sound like something Nintendo

722
01:05:43,240 --> 01:05:47,240
would do, repackaging the same thing seven different ways? It's like, you should buy

723
01:05:47,240 --> 01:05:50,960
seven Game Boy Advances so you can have them all in different colors. Wouldn't that be

724
01:05:50,960 --> 01:05:57,360
be fabulous? How many iMac colors are there? Yeah, exactly. It's like an iMac. Uh, Jamie,

725
01:05:57,360 --> 01:06:02,400
you're gonna get nice style, right? I'm debating. Are you gonna go for one of these frilly combinations

726
01:06:02,400 --> 01:06:06,600
if you do it? I'm debating. Probably just gonna get the game. Maybe it'll be rare. Are

727
01:06:06,600 --> 01:06:11,660
you gonna do the one where you can buy a member of B4U? No, that's okay. Not unless I get

728
01:06:11,660 --> 01:06:18,660
to, you know, abuse and, you know, maybe draw on her with a Sharpie or something. Beautiful.

729
01:06:18,660 --> 01:06:25,660
How about you, Loki? Any interest in this stuff at all? You're not a big 2DX fan, though, huh?

730
01:06:25,660 --> 01:06:30,660
No, I'm not really a huge fan of 2DX. I don't really even play 2DX, so...

731
01:06:30,660 --> 01:06:37,660
No, I'm not excited about this at all. The only thing I'd be excited about is, like, V-R 10. Maybe that's about it, though.

732
01:06:37,660 --> 01:06:43,660
Everything else is just old to me. You know, like, I don't really care about the Visual Emotion CD or whatever that is.

733
01:06:43,660 --> 01:06:56,660
The benefit CD might be cool, because I think it might be the live performance or whatever they did, you know how they do those invitation only concerts and crap. I think that's probably what it is, the second one of those.

734
01:06:56,660 --> 01:07:06,660
Yeah, it'd be rare. Just like the audio CDs that are coming with that. And of course, the consumer tracks that will be on 2DX9, so that'll be cool.

735
01:07:06,660 --> 01:07:16,660
Um, this is interesting, um, this just in, and it goes back to the topic we were talking

736
01:07:16,660 --> 01:07:22,580
about previously, literally, just in, Elmo posted this in chat, it says, use the letters

737
01:07:22,580 --> 01:07:27,300
SCAN, and that whole Konami of Hawaii site thing with the hidden banners, if you use

738
01:07:27,300 --> 01:07:34,060
SCAN, S-C-A-N, as the letters, Mystique, Scandalous, that's the song I've heard of the club a few

739
01:07:34,060 --> 01:07:38,500
times that's definitely a big license song I know that song so very

740
01:07:38,500 --> 01:07:44,620
interesting all hidden away on Konami of Hawaii's site for some reason who knows

741
01:07:44,620 --> 01:07:50,580
and of course Jason in our chat room our resident one of our many internet geeks

742
01:07:50,580 --> 01:07:56,300
we have to listen to this show is kind of is talking about what you found the

743
01:07:56,300 --> 01:08:00,220
banner for randomly typing in letters I did AAA and I found a well we all know

744
01:08:00,220 --> 01:08:03,220
that A's in the game I know but I mean I was just randomly typing in letters yeah

745
01:08:03,220 --> 01:08:09,740
Yeah, yeah. It works. But he says that if you think about it, every DDR version, you

746
01:08:09,740 --> 01:08:13,220
remember the master song list? Loki's talked about this on the show before in the past.

747
01:08:13,220 --> 01:08:16,620
If you haven't listened to the show in a while, you probably never heard this. But basically

748
01:08:16,620 --> 01:08:22,100
the every DDR song has this four letter code and some kind of master list of songs that's

749
01:08:22,100 --> 01:08:28,140
out there. And is there a connection between that list and the fact that the way these

750
01:08:28,140 --> 01:08:34,260
files were named, the songs happened to have a four letter link to them. So, maybe they

751
01:08:34,260 --> 01:08:44,260
were kind of, who knows, linking that all together. Very interesting. Very, very, very

752
01:08:44,260 --> 01:08:49,700
interesting. Oh my gosh, look at this. I don't, what are they doing? Somebody must be running

753
01:08:49,700 --> 01:08:57,180
it right now. El Mollet just said, use the letters P-A-R-T and you get this song. Pink,

754
01:08:57,180 --> 01:09:02,300
get the party started you guys know pink right yeah yeah wasn't that a pump song

755
01:09:02,300 --> 01:09:09,940
too yeah there's a pump song weird weird stuff

756
01:09:10,100 --> 01:09:16,900
you're ready here first for some reason pink Beyonce mystique they're all

757
01:09:16,900 --> 01:09:20,860
lurking on Konami of Hawaii site is there a big song pack planned for the

758
01:09:20,860 --> 01:09:30,660
future? Who knows? Who knows? Interesting. Let's see where to go to now. I think we'll

759
01:09:30,660 --> 01:09:33,760
take a break. And when we come back from this break, we're going to do the cage match. How's

760
01:09:33,760 --> 01:09:37,260
that sound to you guys? Actually, what we'll do is we'll also open up the Skype line when

761
01:09:37,260 --> 01:09:40,880
we come back. I bet some of you guys might want to comment on either the situation with

762
01:09:40,880 --> 01:09:46,840
the song banners or possibly 2DX night style consumer news. I know some of you folks out

763
01:09:46,840 --> 01:09:49,420
there were really wanting to comment on some of the stuff going on there with that. So

764
01:09:49,420 --> 01:09:54,780
we will certainly open up the skype line for you guys. We're going to start off this break

765
01:09:54,780 --> 01:10:01,940
with a little song from 2DX Red called Gigadelic. Gigadelic? Like a gigabyte? Gigadelic. We'll

766
01:10:01,940 --> 01:10:03,940
We'll be back after this.

767
01:10:31,940 --> 01:10:32,440
Hey!

768
01:10:36,240 --> 01:10:36,740
Hey!

769
01:10:36,740 --> 01:10:37,240
Hey!

770
01:10:37,240 --> 01:10:37,740
Hey!

771
01:10:42,740 --> 01:10:43,240
Hey!

772
01:12:43,240 --> 01:12:46,700
Je me sauvignon d'être un proure

773
01:12:46,700 --> 01:12:52,100
C'est un sérémer, je m'appelle pas en c'est, c'est

01:12:52,100 --> 01:12:57,460
Je vous pouvez pas quelqu'il fois

01:12:57,460 --> 01:13:03,060
Quelqu'il fois, quelqu'il fois

776
01:13:03,060 --> 01:13:08,460
Je vous pouvez pas quelqu'il fois

777
01:14:08,460 --> 01:14:10,460
You

778
01:14:38,460 --> 01:14:45,460
When the time is coming for the show

779
01:14:45,460 --> 01:15:05,460
When the time is coming for the show

780
01:15:05,460 --> 01:15:08,460
The time is coming for the show

781
01:15:08,460 --> 01:15:11,460
We got so excited

782
01:15:11,460 --> 01:15:13,460
I remember last time

783
01:15:13,460 --> 01:15:15,460
When I

784
01:15:15,460 --> 01:15:17,460
Got crazy

785
01:15:17,460 --> 01:15:19,460
Looking over the crowd

786
01:15:19,460 --> 01:15:22,460
I could see them having fun

787
01:15:22,460 --> 01:15:25,460
When the music and the car

788
01:15:25,460 --> 01:15:28,460
Met together on the floor

789
01:15:28,460 --> 01:15:32,460
When they'll take shining cards off your tree

790
01:15:32,460 --> 01:15:36,460
Show me the way for a loving, amazing

791
01:15:36,460 --> 01:15:41,460
House and two dogs, what's all this love for you?

792
01:15:54,460 --> 01:15:57,460
Don't you know the crowd?

793
01:15:57,460 --> 01:16:00,460
I can see them having fun

794
01:16:00,460 --> 01:16:06,460
When the music and the cards match together and look up

795
01:16:06,460 --> 01:16:10,460
Where they'll take shining cards off your plate

796
01:16:10,460 --> 01:16:13,460
Show me the way for loving

797
01:16:13,460 --> 01:16:17,460
And making cards until you're

798
01:16:17,460 --> 01:16:20,460
I promise I'm for you

799
01:16:47,460 --> 01:16:58,220
We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio, and you should see our chat room, they're going

800
01:16:58,220 --> 01:17:01,780
crazy trying to come up with all these four-letter combinations now to try and figure out what

801
01:17:01,780 --> 01:17:06,340
else they can find on the site. Even though, apparently there's a script that's running,

802
01:17:06,340 --> 01:17:10,420
I think it was running for a while and then it stopped. Cutress made a post about he had

803
01:17:10,420 --> 01:17:14,300
to stop it, and he's thinking about starting it again. That's not stopping people in our

804
01:17:14,300 --> 01:17:17,820
chat room from going and trying to figure out all the four-letter combinations. Now

805
01:17:17,820 --> 01:17:22,320
somebody's trying to dig up a master list so they can go through all the four letters.

806
01:17:22,320 --> 01:17:26,260
I wouldn't know anything about that. God damn, you people got time on your hands.

807
01:17:26,260 --> 01:17:32,440
It's beautiful. It's crazy how obsessed people are with DDR. Maybe not necessarily obsessed

808
01:17:32,440 --> 01:17:37,980
with DDR, but just obsessed. Pointing the finger. Yeah, finding, solving the mystery.

809
01:17:37,980 --> 01:17:43,740
There's a little bit of a thrill of it, I think. It's kind of neat. Matt? Or Loki? I

810
01:17:43,740 --> 01:17:52,740
I was going to say that there were a few four-letter codes I think I had posted on our site a long-ass time ago, but if you look in the news archives, you probably could find it.

811
01:17:52,740 --> 01:17:55,740
So, anyways.

812
01:17:55,740 --> 01:17:58,740
Very interesting.

813
01:17:58,740 --> 01:18:02,740
Yeah, I think if you do a news archive search, there is a master list somewhere.

814
01:18:02,740 --> 01:18:03,740
Huh.

815
01:18:03,740 --> 01:18:06,740
They were numeric.

816
01:18:06,740 --> 01:18:08,740
Yeah. Hmm.

817
01:18:08,740 --> 01:18:09,740
And they didn't work.

818
01:18:09,740 --> 01:18:10,740
And what, the...

819
01:18:10,740 --> 01:18:12,740
The numeric codes don't work.

820
01:18:12,740 --> 01:18:20,120
oh they don't interesting I tried about six or seven of them well they're gonna

821
01:18:20,120 --> 01:18:25,580
there some folks are are going in the crazy and trying to find something out

822
01:18:25,580 --> 01:18:31,080
good luck you guys and if you find out more tell us so we can spoil the news on

823
01:18:31,080 --> 01:18:35,720
air for everybody what news it is we don't know just you know hey this song

824
01:18:35,720 --> 01:18:40,000
banner sitting here in a directory not being used for anything probably don't

825
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:44,760
mean shit, but boy, isn't it funny what Konami keeps on their site? I wonder what other kind

826
01:18:44,760 --> 01:18:48,760
of goodies Konami has on their site. Maybe they've got like top secret documents and

827
01:18:48,760 --> 01:18:53,720
stuff all hidden on their website, who knows. Anyway, we're going to open up the Skype line

828
01:18:53,720 --> 01:18:58,320
for those of you guys who want to give us a call. Just go to www.orangelandradio.com,

829
01:18:58,320 --> 01:19:02,920
click on interact with us, and you can read all about how you, yes you the listener, can

830
01:19:02,920 --> 01:19:08,760
call us. We're ghetto, you see, and we can't afford an 800 number really, so we have you

831
01:19:08,760 --> 01:19:15,040
call us using this fancy little internet program so do that and call us and we'll

832
01:19:15,040 --> 01:19:19,160
take your call live on air and you can interact with us that way so we'll open

833
01:19:19,160 --> 01:19:22,680
up the sky believe it usually takes a little bit for folks to call in because

834
01:19:22,680 --> 01:19:26,680
of the buffer we are getting one call right now though let's go to it hello

835
01:19:26,680 --> 01:19:34,120
you are on orange lounge radio legend of Zaku hello legend of Zaku how are you

836
01:19:34,120 --> 01:19:41,120
Let me see, he's trying to figure out any other banners that I can actually guess from the site.

837
01:19:41,120 --> 01:19:47,120
It's just not a Skype line segment if Zaku doesn't hammer the lines and get in first, man. It's crazy.

838
01:19:47,120 --> 01:19:50,120
It's just luck, man. I just managed to hit it first.

839
01:19:50,120 --> 01:19:54,120
Apparently, yeah. Now there's a bunch of people trying to get in right now, but you got in there first. Lucky you.

840
01:19:54,120 --> 01:20:02,120
Why, is my question, why are you hammering the site trying to find all these different letter combinations?

841
01:20:02,120 --> 01:20:07,120
Think about it. I mean, if you find it, then you'll probably be the first one to know.

842
01:20:07,120 --> 01:20:11,120
You know, and then you'll be tempted to just, you know, spread the news.

843
01:20:11,120 --> 01:20:17,120
And then, you know, if it gets to that point where Konami finds out what we're actually doing, then it might be a problem.

844
01:20:17,120 --> 01:20:20,120
Because we know too much.

845
01:20:20,120 --> 01:20:25,120
What exactly are you finding out? That's the problem. We have no idea what we're finding out.

846
01:20:25,120 --> 01:20:26,180
finding out

847
01:20:26,180 --> 01:20:28,420
we've got to find out banners

848
01:20:28,420 --> 01:20:31,420
i mean they could be part of you know possibly to find out whatever might be

849
01:20:31,420 --> 01:20:35,340
on the next uh... the next song packs it could also just be something fucking

850
01:20:35,340 --> 01:20:38,620
with us it could be somebody fucking with us that could be it completely

851
01:20:38,620 --> 01:20:41,320
somebody's just fucking with ya could be true

852
01:20:41,320 --> 01:20:43,100
i you know cutriss is a i mean

853
01:20:43,100 --> 01:20:44,420
but great guys

854
01:20:44,420 --> 01:20:48,540
but he's a mod on ddr freak what a perfect person to be in cahoots with

855
01:20:48,540 --> 01:20:50,620
konami right yes

856
01:20:50,620 --> 01:20:52,820
although i doubt it the only one who could

857
01:20:52,820 --> 01:20:56,820
After last year's April Fool's joke, though, I wouldn't put it past anybody.

858
01:20:56,820 --> 01:20:59,820
You know what? I'm not going to say anything.

859
01:20:59,820 --> 01:21:02,820
The way Konami has involvement in this, you know, this thing.

860
01:21:02,820 --> 01:21:06,820
So, the only thing I'm saying is, I mean, it's real simple.

861
01:21:06,820 --> 01:21:10,820
We already know that some of the good licenses we've managed to figure out,

862
01:21:10,820 --> 01:21:17,820
and I'm surprised at how far Konami is going, and we don't even know to what extent they are going to.

863
01:21:17,820 --> 01:21:19,820
Yeah, you're right. We don't know.

864
01:21:19,820 --> 01:21:25,820
Oh, the access for, you know, who's trying to, or what files are trying to be loaded and all that stuff?

865
01:21:25,820 --> 01:21:33,820
I mean, no, the fact that we managed to uncover certain licenses that, you know, we thought, you know, Konami would never, you know, imagine getting.

866
01:21:33,820 --> 01:21:40,820
Well, as far as I know, though, the webmaster of the Konami site there reads the DDR Freak thread.

867
01:21:40,820 --> 01:21:45,820
She's going to wake up Monday morning and see this and meow.

868
01:21:45,820 --> 01:21:46,820
Rename the files?

869
01:21:46,820 --> 01:21:51,660
probably the files are going to be gone at some point tomorrow, but what cat? The question

870
01:21:51,660 --> 01:21:57,500
is, if the files are deleted, then we know we found something we weren't supposed to

871
01:21:57,500 --> 01:22:04,380
find. But what? What cat and what bag was just let out? We don't know.

872
01:22:04,380 --> 01:22:08,820
I don't think they have anything on us. They have nothing on us. We just managed to find

873
01:22:08,820 --> 01:22:10,160
it because of dumb luck.

874
01:22:10,160 --> 01:22:17,060
Either way, either way, even if these songs, even if this whole thing was just set up to

875
01:22:17,060 --> 01:22:25,920
fuck with us and these songs never see the light of day, you bet, you bet, yeah seriously,

876
01:22:25,920 --> 01:22:31,820
you bet some jerk over on one of the sim files sites, just kidding, love you guys, there'll

877
01:22:31,820 --> 01:22:36,500
be sim files made out of these songs strictly so that somebody can use these banners.

878
01:22:36,500 --> 01:22:49,500
That's true. I don't know. It depends. I mean, it could go either way. We're just basically taking stabs in the dark right now and we're hitting something.

879
01:22:49,500 --> 01:22:52,500
I think that's a nice way to sum it up.

880
01:22:52,500 --> 01:22:59,500
I mean, Konami... I can only thank Konami for basically trying at least to get some decent licenses

881
01:22:59,500 --> 01:23:01,500
compared to the ones that they did for Europe.

882
01:23:02,500 --> 01:23:03,500
Beyonce?

883
01:23:03,500 --> 01:23:05,500
You know, from what I've seen.

884
01:23:05,500 --> 01:23:07,500
Beyonce? That's huge!

885
01:23:07,500 --> 01:23:10,500
That is huge! Crazy in Love by Beyonce.

886
01:23:10,500 --> 01:23:11,500
That is huge!

887
01:23:11,500 --> 01:23:14,500
If that is going to be in one of the downloadable song packs...

888
01:23:14,500 --> 01:23:16,500
I'll just wait for the steps.

889
01:23:16,500 --> 01:23:21,500
If that is going to be in one of the downloadable song packs, that is freaking huge.

890
01:23:21,500 --> 01:23:25,580
The first question people are going to ask probably will be, why the hell wasn't this

891
01:23:25,580 --> 01:23:26,940
in the game to start with?

892
01:23:26,940 --> 01:23:28,600
But we don't know.

893
01:23:28,600 --> 01:23:29,860
We don't know any of this.

894
01:23:29,860 --> 01:23:30,940
Will our questions ever be answered?

895
01:23:30,940 --> 01:23:31,940
Probably not.

896
01:23:31,940 --> 01:23:33,700
Well, yeah, that's another good question.

897
01:23:33,700 --> 01:23:36,980
But I'll just, but I'll judge that song once I see the steps.

898
01:23:36,980 --> 01:23:38,540
Well, yeah, it always comes down to that.

899
01:23:38,540 --> 01:23:42,060
Because if they're like eight, like most of the new songs, like eight to nine, like most

900
01:23:42,060 --> 01:23:47,140
of the new songs are, then, you know, then I'll make my, I'll make my decision.

901
01:23:47,140 --> 01:23:48,140
Alright.

902
01:23:48,140 --> 01:23:50,340
Until then, we can only just speculate.

903
01:23:50,340 --> 01:23:51,340
Sounds good.

904
01:23:51,340 --> 01:23:54,520
with us, Saku. That's about it. Alright, I got other people trying to get in, so I'm

905
01:23:54,520 --> 01:24:05,520
going to have to let you go. Um... bye. Alright. Bye, Saku. Have a good one. Later. You know,

906
01:24:05,520 --> 01:24:08,780
somebody in the chat room just pointed out something very interesting. The chat room

907
01:24:08,780 --> 01:24:14,520
just died. I know what you're doing. You're all trying to hammer that site right now.

908
01:24:14,520 --> 01:24:19,080
Okay, maybe not. Maybe some of you guys had to go watch the last part of the stupid bowl

909
01:24:19,080 --> 01:24:24,840
and see that what the Patriots won. Who are the Patriots? Who are they? I... Is it what?

910
01:24:24,840 --> 01:24:29,160
New England. Oh, New England. Some team. Like the whole... Yeah. The whole part of that

911
01:24:29,160 --> 01:24:34,640
nation? The New England? All of it? They've won it for the past couple of years. Oh, I'm

912
01:24:34,640 --> 01:24:37,680
totally not even paying attention to the Skype line. There's another call coming in. Let's

913
01:24:37,680 --> 01:24:45,800
go to it. Hi, you're on Orange Lawns Radio. Hello, you are on Orange Lawns Radio. You're

914
01:24:45,800 --> 01:24:47,800
You're soon to not be on Orange Lawn's Radio.

915
01:25:15,800 --> 01:25:22,300
If you're going to call the show, before you call us, add this username to your Skype list, give them a call.

916
01:25:22,300 --> 01:25:26,800
Echo123. It's Echo123.

917
01:25:26,800 --> 01:25:31,300
And when you call that, you can hear yourself. It's like, literally an echo.

918
01:25:31,300 --> 01:25:36,300
So you can tell if your Skype line's working or not. So, really good tip for you guys. So, give that a try.

919
01:25:36,300 --> 01:25:37,800
Anyway, what's on your mind, Ziggy?

920
01:25:37,800 --> 01:25:40,300
Well, it's about night style.

921
01:25:40,300 --> 01:25:43,300
Ah, yes, night style. What's up with night style?

922
01:25:43,300 --> 01:25:48,300
Yeah, I was, yeah, yeah, this benefit CD, which is really obvious.

923
01:25:48,300 --> 01:25:51,300
What is this benefit CD? What is this?

924
01:25:51,300 --> 01:25:56,300
I think it has something to do with, you know, with, uh, for every benefit CD that you buy, it will go to charity.

925
01:25:56,300 --> 01:25:59,300
Isn't it for the tsunami victims?

926
01:25:59,300 --> 01:26:01,300
I was gonna say, I was gonna say, that's all I've heard.

927
01:26:01,300 --> 01:26:07,300
Every time I hear the word benefit lately, I know it's some type of tsunami benefit thing.

928
01:26:07,300 --> 01:26:12,300
Don't get me wrong, great idea, great concept, lot of people there need help.

929
01:26:12,300 --> 01:26:18,260
But you know, there's other good organizations out there to donate to too. That's all I want to say. Yeah, so

930
01:26:19,100 --> 01:26:21,100
So have you seen the uh?

931
01:26:21,180 --> 01:26:26,720
Cover art for a night style. I did see the cover art for night style, but I didn't show it to the other people in studio

932
01:26:27,340 --> 01:26:33,300
And now I have no idea where the box art went. It's Rob's lousy. I know I'm horrible

933
01:26:33,300 --> 01:26:36,780
I I will dig it up though the box art. What did you think of the box art?

934
01:26:36,780 --> 01:26:42,780
Well, it's really fine to me, actually. Everybody at the Money Style has been complaining about it.

935
01:26:42,780 --> 01:26:50,780
You know what? And when I looked at it, it looked fine to me, too. I don't know what the people are bitching about, really. It's better than some of the other ones, I think.

936
01:26:50,780 --> 01:26:57,780
They're actually buying what's in the game, not what's on the cover art.

937
01:26:57,780 --> 01:27:01,360
point here it is for those of you in studio and we'll actually actually I can

938
01:27:01,360 --> 01:27:06,180
post this as well hahaha in our chat room here is a picture of the night

939
01:27:06,180 --> 01:27:10,380
style cover what do you guys think of that

940
01:27:10,380 --> 01:27:19,820
Logan it looks cool that's kind of that's pretty bad I don't see the

941
01:27:19,820 --> 01:27:24,860
problem with it I mean they've got your mandatory DJ girl on it so you know and

942
01:27:24,860 --> 01:27:34,420
Eddy. Uh huh. Are those the two new characters in 9th Style? Yeah, they're the 2DX DJs representing

943
01:27:34,420 --> 01:27:39,320
9th Style. That's what I thought. Yuhua and Eddy. That's what I thought, and it looks

944
01:27:39,320 --> 01:27:46,060
fine to me. Look at that, it looks like she just got a manicure today. You know, those

945
01:27:46,060 --> 01:27:51,700
people who've been complaining, they were thinking of the actual poster as the cover

946
01:27:51,700 --> 01:27:58,700
art for Night Style. Oh, because that was the poster as well? It's supposed to be the

947
01:27:58,700 --> 01:28:07,060
poster. So Konami got a little lazy, who cares? I'm happy as hell that we're getting Night

948
01:28:07,060 --> 01:28:11,240
Style in the first place. If they're going to get a little sloppy and make the poster

949
01:28:11,240 --> 01:28:16,500
the same thing as the cover art, I don't care. It's a fine picture. I would be more much

950
01:28:16,500 --> 01:28:19,500
I'm much happier if they put reincarnation back on night style.

951
01:28:20,500 --> 01:28:24,500
Oh, reincarnation. Aren't they supposed to be bringing a bunch of songs back?

952
01:28:25,500 --> 01:28:31,500
Actually, I already mentioned to you last time that there would be three songs that would mostly come back.

953
01:28:32,500 --> 01:28:36,500
Right. Well, aren't there songs that have new anothers that need to be accounted for?

954
01:28:37,500 --> 01:28:40,500
Yeah. Jams, Screams, Minimalion, and Checking You Out.

955
01:28:41,500 --> 01:28:42,500
Right, right. Okay. That's right.

956
01:28:42,500 --> 01:28:44,500
Hmm.

957
01:28:44,500 --> 01:28:46,500
Well, it sounds like it's going to be a good mix either way.

958
01:28:46,500 --> 01:28:49,500
I can't wait to hear more details. I can't wait to see that full song list.

959
01:28:49,500 --> 01:28:54,500
And what I really want to see, I want to see if we get any more preview tracks from 10th and 11th.

960
01:28:54,500 --> 01:28:57,500
And I want to see, and I know it's red, but I'm calling it 11th.

961
01:28:57,500 --> 01:28:59,500
I want to see if there are, like, good preview songs.

962
01:28:59,500 --> 01:29:01,500
I want Kachak.

963
01:29:01,500 --> 01:29:02,500
What?

964
01:29:02,500 --> 01:29:03,500
I want Kachak.

965
01:29:03,500 --> 01:29:05,500
Kachak would be cool.

966
01:29:05,500 --> 01:29:10,500
I personally would love to have the Ryu song, Agiha.

967
01:29:10,500 --> 01:29:11,500
I want that song.

968
01:29:11,500 --> 01:29:12,500
I want that song.

969
01:29:12,500 --> 01:29:13,500
Huh?

970
01:29:13,500 --> 01:29:14,500
I get hot.

971
01:29:14,500 --> 01:29:15,500
I get hot.

972
01:29:15,500 --> 01:29:16,500
Oh, sorry.

973
01:29:16,500 --> 01:29:17,500
You sound like you're coughing up a hairball.

974
01:29:17,500 --> 01:29:18,500
I get hot.

975
01:29:18,500 --> 01:29:19,500
I get hot.

976
01:29:19,500 --> 01:29:20,500
I get hot.

977
01:29:20,500 --> 01:29:21,500
I want that song.

978
01:29:21,500 --> 01:29:25,540
All right, well, you've been listening to this show long enough.

979
01:29:25,540 --> 01:29:27,500
You know I'm really white when it comes to my pronunciation.

980
01:29:27,500 --> 01:29:30,820
Yeah, but I'm always here to help you out.

981
01:29:30,820 --> 01:29:31,820
Well, I appreciate it.

982
01:29:31,820 --> 01:29:33,620
It's the beauty of the Skype line.

983
01:29:33,620 --> 01:29:35,740
I can be corrected almost in person.

984
01:29:35,740 --> 01:29:36,740
It's great.

985
01:29:36,740 --> 01:29:37,980
You can be corrected in person.

986
01:29:37,980 --> 01:29:40,940
Yeah, when Jamie isn't here to correct me in person, you are.

987
01:29:40,940 --> 01:29:41,940
It's just, it's beautiful.

988
01:29:41,940 --> 01:29:42,940
Yeah.

989
01:29:42,940 --> 01:29:48,780
And there's another one that you mispronounce it a lot, uh, you know, the artist, uh, Cheer

990
01:29:48,780 --> 01:29:50,860
Train, who's actually Fujita Blender.

991
01:29:50,860 --> 01:29:51,860
Fujita?

992
01:29:51,860 --> 01:29:52,860
Yeah.

993
01:29:52,860 --> 01:29:53,860
I like Fuzita.

994
01:29:53,860 --> 01:29:54,860
Oh.

995
01:29:54,860 --> 01:29:55,860
Alright.

996
01:29:55,860 --> 01:29:59,700
We're gonna let you go, because we're getting other calls, and I want to let you get back

997
01:29:59,700 --> 01:30:01,660
to that AOL conversation you're having in the background.

998
01:30:01,660 --> 01:30:02,660
Alright?

999
01:30:02,660 --> 01:30:03,660
Alright.

1000
01:30:03,660 --> 01:30:04,660
Have a good one.

1001
01:30:04,660 --> 01:30:05,660
Later.

1002
01:30:05,660 --> 01:30:06,660
Bye.

1003
01:30:06,660 --> 01:30:07,660
We got another call.

1004
01:30:07,660 --> 01:30:09,620
We'll take, we'll take one more call, then maybe we'll go to the cage match after this.

1005
01:30:09,620 --> 01:30:10,620
I don't know.

1006
01:30:10,620 --> 01:30:13,620
What, you don't like talking to people on the Skype line?

1007
01:30:13,620 --> 01:30:15,620
I like talking to people, but I'm ready for the cage match.

1008
01:30:15,620 --> 01:30:17,620
Oh, you want to bring it on?

1009
01:30:17,620 --> 01:30:19,620
Well, I just don't really care.

1010
01:30:19,620 --> 01:30:20,620
Alright, let me get to this person...

1011
01:30:20,620 --> 01:30:22,620
It's already been brought in.

1012
01:30:22,620 --> 01:30:26,620
Let me get to this poor person who's sitting here on the Skype line waiting for us to acknowledge their presence.

1013
01:30:26,620 --> 01:30:28,620
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio!

1014
01:30:28,620 --> 01:30:30,620
Hey, Sky, it's El Mullet again.

1015
01:30:30,620 --> 01:30:32,620
Hello, El Mullet!

1016
01:30:32,620 --> 01:30:36,620
What is going on? You guys are just digging through Konami's site right now.

1017
01:30:36,620 --> 01:30:39,620
You're posting all these crazy banners. What's going on?

1018
01:30:39,620 --> 01:30:43,620
Well, all these crazy banners equal two that I found, but...

1019
01:30:43,620 --> 01:30:46,620
Hey! That's more than I found!

1020
01:30:46,620 --> 01:30:51,620
I just put in two random words, and I pulled out two things.

1021
01:30:51,620 --> 01:30:53,620
I have no idea.

1022
01:30:53,620 --> 01:30:57,620
So you're trying to think of, like, four-letter words that might come up with something.

1023
01:30:57,620 --> 01:31:00,620
Yeah, something like that, and then I'm bored.

1024
01:31:00,620 --> 01:31:04,620
Wow, and you found two. What do you think this all is? What do you think this all adds up to?

1025
01:31:04,620 --> 01:31:19,620
I wouldn't read too much into it personally. I mean, I'm sure that there's some sort of explanation why we've managed to pull up five licensed songs. I'm thinking maybe, you know, they were there, but now they're not there, you know.

1026
01:31:19,620 --> 01:31:24,620
Five songs? Five songs in a song pack? Loki, Loki's tapping my leg for something.

1027
01:31:24,620 --> 01:31:35,620
It might be noticed, or I might mention that not only by putting in who those directories are, you're pulling up stuff from UltraMix 2 but UltraMix 1.

1028
01:31:35,620 --> 01:31:38,620
So I could theorize it could be also UltraMix 3.

1029
01:31:38,620 --> 01:31:43,620
Ah, now that's a good thought there. Maybe these are possible UltraMix 3 songs.

1030
01:31:43,620 --> 01:31:44,620
Or UltraMix 7.

1031
01:31:44,620 --> 01:31:49,620
That's enough of Song Pack 5 by doing the same thing, so that's UltraMix 1.

1032
01:31:49,620 --> 01:31:59,620
Interesting. Because we all know Ultramix 3 has to happen at this point. It has to. Has to happen. And if it doesn't happen, there will be burnination going on.

1033
01:31:59,620 --> 01:32:10,620
I mean, I'm going to amount all this banner finding. Remember when a picture was leaked that had the take it to the morning light banner from DDR Max and it had an SP4 icon on it?

1034
01:32:10,620 --> 01:32:13,620
I remember that. I remember that. And it didn't mean shit.

1035
01:32:13,620 --> 01:32:18,620
Yeah, it didn't mean shit. What we could be pulling up right now could very well not be meaning shit at all.

1036
01:32:18,620 --> 01:32:25,060
all. They're pretty banners. That Crazy in Love banner is kind of cute. That's not the

1037
01:32:25,060 --> 01:32:30,100
kind of banner I would have put for that song. I would have just put a big booty as the banner

1038
01:32:30,100 --> 01:32:35,100
for Crazy in Love, because every time that song comes on, I just think of booty dancing.

1039
01:32:35,100 --> 01:32:38,860
But yet the Crazy in Love banner... I don't want to hear that song now. No, no you don't.

1040
01:32:38,860 --> 01:32:43,260
I don't think I have it. Believe it or not, I don't think I have it on my drive. You think

1041
01:32:43,260 --> 01:32:47,420
that would be a song? I need that song. I need to play it Tuesday. I have plenty of

1042
01:32:47,420 --> 01:33:06,420
I've been looking for crazy right now in love, I've been looking for crazy right now, I've

1043
01:33:06,420 --> 01:33:13,420
play a little clip here. Here it is, here it is. Come on, don't you want to shake your

1044
01:33:18,820 --> 01:33:25,820
booty? This is the part I like. Yeah, that would be, oh I'm sorry, I totally cut it off

1045
01:33:25,820 --> 01:33:29,820
Looking so crazy in the hood, got me looking, got me looking so crazy in the hood

1046
01:33:55,820 --> 01:34:02,060
also pulled like two Konami original banners we pulled the Cutris pulled off

1047
01:34:02,060 --> 01:34:08,380
GMD and hold on me that's right so who knows where that's going on so that's

1048
01:34:08,380 --> 01:34:14,060
seven songs so it's not a true song pack that's true that's true so there's more

1049
01:34:14,060 --> 01:34:21,140
than five so who knows what's going on I'm sure an explanation will be offered

1050
01:34:21,140 --> 01:34:26,980
you know, eventually, like how Song Pack 8 is going to be released eventually.

1051
01:34:26,980 --> 01:34:32,380
Don't get me started on that, I'm so mad at Microsoft for that.

1052
01:34:32,380 --> 01:34:39,700
One of the licensed songs for Ultramix One, Shiny Disco Balls was one, and Do That Fang,

1053
01:34:39,700 --> 01:34:41,700
Castles in the Sky.

1054
01:34:41,700 --> 01:34:42,700
Okay.

1055
01:34:42,700 --> 01:34:47,340
Loki's trying to pull up all these banners from Ultramix One over there, I think, or

1056
01:34:47,340 --> 01:34:48,340
something.

1057
01:34:48,340 --> 01:34:49,340
I don't know what he's doing.

1058
01:34:49,340 --> 01:34:55,840
You know that if trying to find something secret that you're not supposed to see on some website is involved,

1059
01:34:55,840 --> 01:34:56,840
Loki's in on it.

1060
01:34:57,840 --> 01:34:59,840
Anything else you want to share with us, Emelot?

1061
01:35:00,340 --> 01:35:03,840
That's pretty much it. This is the big topic of conversation right now, after all.

1062
01:35:03,840 --> 01:35:04,840
You know what?

1063
01:35:05,840 --> 01:35:13,340
Unfortunately, the way things work in the Bemani scene is it seems like now we're getting in this rhythm of getting all our games at the end of the year in the Christmas season,

1064
01:35:13,340 --> 01:35:17,660
which makes everything post Christmas to E3

1065
01:35:17,660 --> 01:35:21,300
a real dead period. But

1066
01:35:21,300 --> 01:35:24,940
that's why we talk about other stuff too. What can we say? Exactly.

1067
01:35:24,940 --> 01:35:29,060
Alright. Hey, plug your site. Insightpulse.com

1068
01:35:29,060 --> 01:35:32,580

1069
01:35:32,580 --> 01:35:36,580

I know some you guys are still trying to get through on the skype line I'm really

1076
01:35:59,300 --> 01:36:01,420

01:36:13,820 --> 01:36:16,980
ask him what their trick is to get in because they always seem to be able to do

1082
01:36:16,980 --> 01:36:17,900
it somehow

1083
01:36:17,900 --> 01:36:21,060

1087
01:36:35,220 --> 01:36:41,620
last week in the orange lounge radio cage match it kind of surprised us

1088
01:36:41,620 --> 01:36:46,780
because echo image was given the boot from the cage match and it was replaced

1089
01:36:46,780 --> 01:36:53,020
by dream that's right j-pop artist dream with their rendition of night of fire

1090
01:36:53,020 --> 01:36:55,340

01:36:55,340 --> 01:37:00,180
para para it was Jamie's pick so that's going to be the first song you guys hear

tonight as a reminder the way the cage match works you hear three songs one of

01:37:05,020 --> 01:37:09,540

1095
01:37:14,100 --> 01:37:18,940

1097
01:37:23,020 --> 01:37:28,420

01:39:23,020 --> 01:39:52,220
Alright, so song number one in tonight's cage match, last week's winner, Dream, Night

1099
01:39:52,220 --> 01:39:58,140
of Fire. Will it win again? We'll see. We gotta bring in two challengers though first.

1100
01:39:58,140 --> 01:40:04,100
First up, my pick! Yay, me! Um, I'm gonna pick a band that, this has won the cage match

1101
01:40:04,100 --> 01:40:09,180
a couple times. It's a real popular band amongst, I think, the folks that play DDR, although

1102
01:40:09,180 --> 01:40:16,260
it's not a DDR band. Yeah. But, um, one of our listeners, Allusion, was kind enough to

1103
01:40:16,260 --> 01:40:20,780

1104
01:40:20,780 --> 01:40:25,060
I think it was out last year and I'm just loving it. I'm loving it

This is a song called stake out

1108

Enjoy!

1109
01:41:06,180 --> 01:41:07,180

Ooooooh

Oh just calm down, please, oh come

I've seen you here before

1119
01:41:29,180 --> 01:41:32,180
I want to see you more

1120
01:41:32,180 --> 01:41:35,180
Enjoy your bed inside my head

1121
01:41:35,180 --> 01:41:41,180
I want you in my bed from far away I'll check you out

1122
01:41:41,180 --> 01:41:43,180
Can't let you see me

1123
01:41:44,180 --> 01:41:46,180
I wanna shake out

1124
01:41:47,180 --> 01:41:49,180
I wanna shake out

1125
01:41:50,180 --> 01:41:52,180
I wanna shake out

1126
01:41:52,180 --> 01:42:13,460
I've got a plan in mind for you I'm waiting till the time is right

1127
01:42:13,460 --> 01:42:16,900
I know that you like what I do No need to put up a fight

1128
01:42:16,900 --> 01:42:19,740
Watching you from far away You look so sweet and clueless

1129
01:42:19,740 --> 01:42:22,740
Soon I'll move in on my prey. It's time for me to do this.

1130
01:42:35,740 --> 01:42:38,740
Watching and waiting.

1131
01:42:38,740 --> 01:42:42,740
The feeling is elating.

1132
01:42:42,740 --> 01:42:45,740
Lying my time.

1133
01:42:45,740 --> 01:42:50,740
Yeah, I know that you're someone

1134
01:42:53,740 --> 01:42:55,740
Someone

1135
01:42:57,740 --> 01:43:03,380
Can't let you see me

1136
01:43:03,740 --> 01:43:06,940
I'm on the stakeout

1137
01:43:07,140 --> 01:43:10,060
I'm on the stakeout

1138
01:43:10,200 --> 01:43:12,580
I'm on a stakeout

1139
01:43:42,580 --> 01:43:44,580
I'm gonna shake out, shake out

1140
01:43:45,580 --> 01:43:47,580
I'm gonna shake out, shake out

1141
01:43:48,580 --> 01:43:50,580
I'm gonna shake out, shake out

1142
01:43:53,580 --> 01:43:55,580
Now I know that you're in my mind

1143
01:44:00,580 --> 01:44:05,580
Alright, first challenger tonight, song number two, Freeze Pop Stake Out

1144
01:44:06,580 --> 01:44:09,580
Did that song stick out in your mind, or would you like to take it out to the trash?

1145
01:44:09,580 --> 01:44:18,580
I like freeze pop because that song just didn't do it for me. Still, it was a good song, so they gave it a 7.

1146
01:44:31,580 --> 01:44:33,580
I like freeze pop, I give it a 9.

1147
01:44:33,580 --> 01:44:35,580
Okay, good. Angel!

1148
01:44:35,580 --> 01:44:37,580
I love Breezepop.

1149
01:44:37,580 --> 01:44:44,580
And, uh, the only time I knew that- knew them, rather, is from, obviously, Amplitude and, uh, frequency.

1150
01:44:44,580 --> 01:44:51,580
So, that sort of did it all for me, and that song is really happy and stuff, so I'll give it a nine.

1151
01:44:51,580 --> 01:44:54,580
A nine from Angel. Loki!

1152
01:44:54,580 --> 01:44:57,580
I absolutely hate Breezepop. I hate-

1153
01:44:57,580 --> 01:44:58,580
We hate you!

1154
01:44:58,580 --> 01:45:03,380
I don't give a shit. You know what? I hate that fucking song. It's awful. It's a one

1155
01:45:03,900 --> 01:45:08,920
Awful, I'm sorry talking over synthesizers is not fucking music awful

1156
01:45:12,660 --> 01:45:17,820
Yes, whereas whereas the song that is oversynth to all hell says girls

1157
01:45:20,100 --> 01:45:22,100
Is music

1158
01:45:22,380 --> 01:45:25,940
Did I never I never said it was good when I put it in okay

1159
01:45:25,940 --> 01:45:36,940
Okay, last time I checked, you're supposed to like the songs, at least somewhat, that you are going to put in the cagement. Call me crazy. Maybe I missed that memo.

1160
01:45:36,940 --> 01:45:38,940
Maybe, maybe.

1161
01:45:38,940 --> 01:45:50,940
Anyway, my thoughts on Freeze Pop. I feel completely opposite from Loki. I think the minimalist synth sound that they have, I think that is what makes them so cool.

1162
01:45:50,940 --> 01:45:55,300
love her voice because she has this very I don't care what you all think type

1163
01:45:55,300 --> 01:46:00,180
thing in your voice I just I love her voice and the pop culture references are

1164
01:46:00,180 --> 01:46:04,100
awesome but they're not cheesy like I've heard bands with cheesy pop culture

1165
01:46:04,100 --> 01:46:09,980
references it's bad they're good yeah yeah so I would give them like I would

1166
01:46:09,980 --> 01:46:13,660
give it like seriously like an eight and a half maybe a nine eight three quarters

1167
01:46:13,660 --> 01:46:16,980
let's give it an eight and three quarters I like it a lot all right let's

1168
01:46:16,980 --> 01:46:20,980
Let's get to song number three, which is Loki's Pick. What did he pick?

1169
01:46:20,980 --> 01:46:23,980
It doesn't matter, it sucks.

1170
01:46:23,980 --> 01:46:26,980
Thank you. Thank you.

1171
01:46:26,980 --> 01:46:29,980
No, um, what I picked was...

1172
01:46:29,980 --> 01:46:36,980
It was actually a song I had heard a while ago and I had downloaded just for the hell of it, because I like the song.

1173
01:46:36,980 --> 01:46:38,980
It's another freeze pop song, isn't it?

1174
01:46:38,980 --> 01:46:41,980
No, it's not a freeze pop song. Thank God.

1175
01:46:41,980 --> 01:46:43,980
Thank God for that.

1176
01:46:43,980 --> 01:46:48,140
No, this is The Killers with Somebody Told Me.

1177
01:46:48,140 --> 01:46:50,340
And it would be like perfect for like Guitar Freaks.

1178
01:46:50,340 --> 01:46:51,340
Cool.

1179
01:46:51,340 --> 01:46:55,280
Alright, Loki says this is his Guitar Freaks song that he would like to see.

1180
01:46:55,280 --> 01:46:57,740
The Killers, Somebody Told Me, song number three.

1181
01:46:57,740 --> 01:46:58,240
Enjoy

1182
01:47:27,740 --> 01:47:37,740
I'm breaking my back just to know your name But having eight clothes in a place like this

1183
01:47:37,740 --> 01:47:47,740
Anything goes but don't blink you might miss Cause having eight clothes in a place like this

1184
01:47:47,740 --> 01:47:56,740
I said I'm having eight clothes in a place like this Bring it back down, bring it back down tonight

1185
01:47:56,740 --> 01:47:58,740
Oh, oh, oh, oh

1186
01:47:58,740 --> 01:48:04,740
Never thought I'd let a rumor ruin my moonlight

1187
01:48:04,740 --> 01:48:08,740
Somebody told me you had a golden breast

1188
01:48:08,740 --> 01:48:10,740
Looked like a girlfriend

1189
01:48:10,740 --> 01:48:13,740
And I had it better be the pair of real-time shears

1190
01:48:13,740 --> 01:48:15,740
And I'm off the next show

1191
01:48:15,740 --> 01:48:17,740
And I'm off the next show

1192
01:48:17,740 --> 01:48:18,740
And I'm off the next show

1193
01:48:18,740 --> 01:48:20,740
Oh, whoopee, whoopee

1194
01:48:20,740 --> 01:48:23,740
Ready, let's roll on to something new

1195
01:48:23,740 --> 01:48:28,740
Take it in so that I'm leaving without you

1196
01:48:30,740 --> 01:48:33,740
I'm ready, let's roll on to something new

1197
01:48:33,740 --> 01:48:37,740
But heaven ain't close to no place like this

1198
01:48:37,740 --> 01:48:43,740
Anything goes to some place you might live

1199
01:48:44,740 --> 01:48:47,740
Cause heaven ain't close to no place like this

1200
01:48:47,740 --> 01:48:51,740
I said heaven ain't close to no place like this

1201
01:48:51,740 --> 01:48:56,740
Bring it back down, bring it back down tonight

1202
01:48:58,740 --> 01:49:04,740
Never thought I'd ever ruin my moonlight

1203
01:49:04,740 --> 01:49:08,740
Somebody told me you had a boyfriend

1204
01:49:08,740 --> 01:49:10,740
Who looked like his girlfriend

1205
01:49:10,740 --> 01:49:12,740
And I hadn't met him yet

1206
01:49:12,740 --> 01:49:15,740
Respect him, it's uncomfortable

1207
01:49:15,740 --> 01:49:19,740
I've got potential for rushing, rushing around

1208
01:49:19,740 --> 01:49:25,740
Taste yourself of me

1209
01:49:25,740 --> 01:49:32,740
I said baby, baby, please

1210
01:49:32,740 --> 01:49:38,740
But I just don't know now

1211
01:49:40,740 --> 01:49:45,740
We are one and we are trying

1212
01:49:45,740 --> 01:49:47,740
Somebody told me

1213
01:50:17,740 --> 01:50:21,240
Who doesn't have to grow fast, they don't have to crack you

1214
01:50:21,240 --> 01:50:24,740
But every time she gets you, it's not confidential

1215
01:50:24,740 --> 01:50:29,740
And I'm not present, I'm rushing, rushing around

1216
01:50:54,740 --> 01:50:59,740
I know, since I don't listen to the radio, this is pretty new to me, so I like it a lot.

1217
01:51:00,740 --> 01:51:02,740
Negative 7, I've been hearing it all week.

1218
01:51:03,740 --> 01:51:07,740
Yeah, I know. Negative 7, I've been hearing it all week.

1219
01:51:10,740 --> 01:51:12,740
It's pretty good. What are you rocking?

1220
01:51:12,740 --> 01:51:21,500
This, boys and girls, let this be a lesson to you. If you're thinking right now that

1221
01:51:21,500 --> 01:51:26,540
this song is overplayed, it's time for you to turn off the radio, seriously, and start

1222
01:51:26,540 --> 01:51:30,880
listening to internet radio and other forms of entertainment that's out there, because

1223
01:51:30,880 --> 01:51:35,540
I have heard that song on the radio the few times I forgot to bring my iPod in the car

1224
01:51:35,540 --> 01:51:38,980
so I could listen to podcasts. I did turn on the radio and I have heard that song so

1225
01:51:38,980 --> 01:51:41,940
I know it's a little mainstream, but I'm not sick of it

1226
01:51:41,940 --> 01:51:48,940
It still feels fresh to me because I haven't allowed corporate horde radio to ruin that song for me yet. Therefore that song I

1227
01:51:49,460 --> 01:51:51,180
Still kind of dig it

1228
01:51:51,180 --> 01:51:53,740
It's a little weird for this cage match

1229
01:51:53,740 --> 01:51:56,780
But I still like the song and don't want to give it a low score

1230
01:51:56,780 --> 01:51:58,780
So I have to give it like a seven and a half

1231
01:51:58,900 --> 01:52:00,100
Loki

1232
01:52:00,100 --> 01:52:02,100
It gets a ten. I was

1233
01:52:02,660 --> 01:52:07,620
No torn between this one or another song put in so I figured I'll try this one and if it doesn't work

1234
01:52:07,620 --> 01:52:12,940
I'll try the next one next week all right fair enough that's it three songs

1235
01:52:12,940 --> 01:52:17,900
your turn your your turn your time to vote here we go the three songs you can

1236
01:52:17,900 --> 01:52:22,700

And song number three that you can vote for tonight, The Killers, Somebody Told Me

1239

Alright, place vote now. Send a private message to Skye in the chat room with your vote and

1241
01:53:10,040 --> 01:53:15,640
two or song number three. Meanwhile, Orange Lounge Radio moves right along, and I gotta

1242
01:53:15,640 --> 01:53:21,760
ask Loki a question I ask Loki every week. What the hell's going on in the sim scene

1243
01:53:21,760 --> 01:53:29,640
now? Anything? Um, I don't think so, really. Other than just people, you know, being afraid

1244
01:53:29,640 --> 01:53:37,360
about, you know, DRA coming after them for downloading sim files and that type of thing.

1245
01:53:37,360 --> 01:53:46,200
All the websites are down, DDRManiaX and DDRUK, two of the big three that are out there are

1246
01:53:46,200 --> 01:53:47,200
down.

1247
01:53:47,200 --> 01:53:52,680
And last week I mentioned, you know, there's a bunch of different sort of food mix type

1248
01:53:52,680 --> 01:54:00,080
packs you can download or check out, and once again those are on the forums for Bill Monning's

1249
01:54:00,080 --> 01:54:02,000
style, you can find those.

1250
01:54:02,000 --> 01:54:07,240
Really nothing's been going on, I think everyone's been just gearing up for Super Bowl or something

1251
01:54:07,240 --> 01:54:11,720
like that because really there's nothing out there. I'm sure you'll see some more coming

1252
01:54:11,720 --> 01:54:18,000
out though for the 2DX Red stuff that's come out because obviously now that the OST rips

1253
01:54:18,000 --> 01:54:23,320
aren't out there you can, you know, bet that there's going to be some of those sim files

1254
01:54:23,320 --> 01:54:31,760
coming out. But besides that, really nothing else going on. It's been just quiet and dead

1255
01:54:31,760 --> 01:54:40,880
like all the websites. So, that's up. That's everything. Kind of sucks.

1256
01:54:40,880 --> 01:54:45,200
You know, is it just that the sim file authors are using the Super Bowl as an excuse to have

1257
01:54:45,200 --> 01:54:52,080
more time to look at Asian prawn on the internet? I don't know why you'd want to look at Asian

1258
01:54:52,080 --> 01:54:56,920
porn, since Asian porn censored, but sure. I guess.

1259
01:54:56,920 --> 01:55:01,360
Well, we can't see Loki's screen for- Let me rephrase. Porn with big-tittied Asian

1260
01:55:01,360 --> 01:55:08,040
girls. Okay, that's completely acceptable then. Can't, I can't tell you how disappointed

1261
01:55:08,040 --> 01:55:11,960
I was when I bought actually like a bunch of VCDs of Asian porn and it was all fucking

1262
01:55:11,960 --> 01:55:16,240
censored. I was like, what the hell is this? This is retarded. This is the dumbest thing.

1263
01:55:16,240 --> 01:55:22,880
Oh my God, those pixels look so hot. You know, mosaics are not sexy. What was the one that

1264
01:55:22,880 --> 01:55:29,680
I got from Dark Sound? The one that Final Fuck X was actually the, that was the first,

1265
01:55:29,680 --> 01:55:35,620
is actually Final Fuck 10, really, was actually the first Asian full-on, like, porn from Asia

1266
01:55:35,620 --> 01:55:38,980
I'd actually seen. It was cosplay porn. Yes, it was cosplay porn with characters from Final

1267
01:55:38,980 --> 01:55:43,180
Fantasy. Didn't we actually do this on the show? I want to say we actually played this

1268
01:55:43,180 --> 01:55:47,220
on the show on an earlier episode. We didn't? No, maybe way back in the day. We did it as

1269
01:55:47,220 --> 01:55:51,860
part of an afterbirth. We did the Dance Dance porn, though. I remember... Yeah, that was

1270
01:55:51,860 --> 01:55:55,780
the one. Loki gave his review of the Dance Dance porn, or what was it called? You remember

1271
01:55:55,780 --> 01:56:00,700
dance fuck or something something like that I have it buried under here on my

1272
01:56:00,700 --> 01:56:05,460
desk somewhere because I remember after I like I bought it or whatever I watched

1273
01:56:05,460 --> 01:56:10,140
it once ago this is interesting and then just kind of tossed it and you know it

1274
01:56:10,140 --> 01:56:17,140
became part of the mass collection of stuff on my desk I what I this was way

1275
01:56:17,140 --> 01:56:21,340
back like episode 30 or 40 like in that area this is like two years ago I think

1276
01:56:21,340 --> 01:56:25,220
we're looking at what the hell was this all about I remember there was it was

1277
01:56:25,220 --> 01:56:30,320
the Dance Dance Fuck movie, and you know, Loki bought it off eBay, because, you know,

1278
01:56:30,320 --> 01:56:35,260
haha, maybe it's connected to Dance Dance Revolution somehow, had nothing to do with

1279
01:56:35,260 --> 01:56:40,640
anything. For those that are unfamiliar out there, and I will show, this is more for the

1280
01:56:40,640 --> 01:56:50,640
in-studio folks, um, there is DDR porn out there. Sadly enough, there is porn that, no,

1281
01:56:50,640 --> 01:56:57,540
porn that's out there and if you if you go here to the but myself image porns

1282
01:56:57,540 --> 01:57:03,440
and we go to the not work safe category here we can see that there are some

1283
01:57:03,440 --> 01:57:16,980
actual you know those you people posting on this board what the hell is wrong

1284
01:57:16,980 --> 01:57:23,980
What's wrong with you? You're drawing pornography to- ugh!

1285
01:57:24,980 --> 01:57:26,980
It's just 4chan, get over it.

1286
01:57:32,980 --> 01:57:34,980
Head hurts.

1287
01:57:34,980 --> 01:57:36,980
Head hurts.

1288
01:57:36,980 --> 01:57:38,980
Jamie, surely you have something to add on this.

1289
01:57:38,980 --> 01:57:40,980
I thought yaoi doujinshi.

1290
01:57:40,980 --> 01:57:46,980
It's just 4chan. It's all things hentai.

1291
01:57:46,980 --> 01:57:52,980
But it's DDR-ish characters. It looks like somebody drew that one.

1292
01:57:52,980 --> 01:57:54,980
It looks like somebody painted that one. It said Max...

1293
01:57:54,980 --> 01:57:59,980
Look! Colors! Beatmania 2DX characters book for adults only.

1294
01:57:59,980 --> 01:58:05,980
Like, the song Colors, and you've got all these girls with big titties standing in front of Colors.

1295
01:58:05,980 --> 01:58:34,860
What is that picture of Tran sitting there where you can totally see her clam?

1296
01:58:34,860 --> 01:58:51,980
is that? Her clam? Wow, way to go there Rob. Welcome to the 90s. I don't care. Now they're

1297
01:58:51,980 --> 01:58:56,580
all posting about it in the chat room. At least she got him to stop typing in random

1298
01:58:56,580 --> 01:59:02,500
four letter words. Now this is going to give more ideas. They're going to try 4chan. Is

1299
01:59:02,500 --> 01:59:11,500
that the orange lounge characters naked? What is wrong? Seriously! Post that link in the

1300
01:59:11,500 --> 01:59:18,780
chatroom. Can you post that link in the chatroom? Somebody found a picture on these bimani style

1301
01:59:18,780 --> 01:59:27,380
porn boards of the orange lounge characters from Mobomoga just naked. Seriously people,

1302
01:59:27,380 --> 01:59:32,860
out of the house. If this is you posting this, this is your homework assignment. You are

1303
01:59:32,860 --> 01:59:40,560
to go outdoors and get at least 3 hours of fresh air this week. And I want you to touch

1304
01:59:40,560 --> 01:59:46,060
a real girl. Make sure you have her permission first and your mom doesn't count, ok? I want

1305
01:59:46,060 --> 01:59:54,420
you to actually go out and touch a real girl. What is? Jamie, look at this one! It's the

1306
01:59:54,420 --> 02:00:00,340
Oh my god, I want to make an icon out of that.

1307
02:00:00,340 --> 02:00:06,340
I want a link to that.

1308
02:00:06,340 --> 02:00:08,820
I just need some heavy breathing to go along with all this.

1309
02:00:08,820 --> 02:00:13,860
Flair O'Nai says that the naked picture of Tartan Toffee should be our new banner for

1310
02:00:13,860 --> 02:00:14,860
Orange Lounge.

1311
02:00:14,860 --> 02:00:15,860
We could do that.

1312
02:00:15,860 --> 02:00:17,060
Well, we do have a site remodeling coming up.

1313
02:00:17,060 --> 02:00:18,060
Hey, how about that?

1314
02:00:18,060 --> 02:00:19,700
We'll just have that in our banner.

1315
02:00:19,700 --> 02:00:20,700
Okay.

1316
02:00:20,700 --> 02:00:22,800
Seen that picture before?

1317
02:00:22,800 --> 02:00:23,800
Forget it.

1318
02:00:23,800 --> 02:00:29,800
I'm done. I'm not going to talk about pornography anymore on the radio. This is pointless, people.

1319
02:00:29,800 --> 02:00:31,800
For the next five minutes.

1320
02:00:31,800 --> 02:00:34,800
Just look at what you missed out on, though, if you're not in the chat room.

1321
02:00:34,800 --> 02:00:36,800
All right, you guys want to know who won the cage match?

1322
02:00:36,800 --> 02:00:37,800
No.

1323
02:00:37,800 --> 02:00:38,800
No?

1324
02:00:38,800 --> 02:00:39,800
Yeah.

1325
02:00:39,800 --> 02:00:40,800
Yeah?

1326
02:00:40,800 --> 02:00:42,800
All right, let's hear who won tonight's cage match.

1327
02:00:42,800 --> 02:00:47,800
The winner of tonight's cage match is...

1328
02:00:47,800 --> 02:01:02,280
Freeze Pop wins tonight.

1329
02:01:02,280 --> 02:01:04,280
And Loki's mad at me.

1330
02:01:04,280 --> 02:01:08,400
Alright, let's go to a break, shall we boys and girls?

1331
02:01:08,400 --> 02:01:14,360
We're gonna go to a break and in this break we gotta get ourselves some more 2DX music

1332
02:01:14,360 --> 02:01:17,440
from 2DX Red because the soundtrack, if you didn't hear, we've been talking about this

1333
02:01:17,440 --> 02:01:22,520
all night. The soundtrack to 2DX Red came out this week, AKA 2DX11 style. That's what

1334
02:01:22,520 --> 02:01:28,360
I've been calling it. I know that's not the real name, and I also don't care, by the way.

1335
02:01:28,360 --> 02:01:31,400
So we've been playing some songs from that all night long, so we're going to keep that

1336
02:01:31,400 --> 02:01:39,840
up. I think what we will play in this break, what are we going to do? I want to play, actually,

1337
02:01:39,840 --> 02:01:44,640
there's a really good song by Sota Fujimori that I want to play. I like that song, so

1338
02:01:44,640 --> 02:01:46,200
So we're going to start it off with that.

1339
02:01:46,200 --> 02:01:49,240
It's called The Hope of Tomorrow, so we're going to start it off with that.

1340
02:01:49,240 --> 02:01:52,160
Maybe we'll do some DJ Simon in this break as well.

1341
02:01:52,160 --> 02:01:57,780
And did we do Don't Be Afraid Myself yet?

1342
02:01:57,780 --> 02:02:01,080
I don't think we did, so we have to do Don't Be Afraid Myself, because I like that song.

1343
02:02:01,080 --> 02:02:02,080
More Freeze Pop.

1344
02:02:02,080 --> 02:02:04,360
No, no, more Freeze Pop tonight.

1345
02:02:04,360 --> 02:02:08,740
And I guess, should we do the Polteri one?

1346
02:02:08,740 --> 02:02:09,740
Why not?

1347
02:02:09,740 --> 02:02:11,620
I'm feeling, I'm feeling risky tonight.

1348
02:02:11,620 --> 02:02:13,340
We're going to do, it's not Naoki.

1349
02:02:13,340 --> 02:02:16,740
June featuring Polteri. So I have no hope.

1350
02:02:16,740 --> 02:02:21,380
We're gonna see how that is raspberry heart. All right, we're gonna play all those songs and we'll be back after this

1351
02:03:16,740 --> 02:03:20,740
And maybe you won't expect this

1352
02:03:20,740 --> 02:03:27,240
And I will appear as I go

1353
02:03:27,240 --> 02:03:29,740
I can't help

1354
02:07:59,740 --> 02:08:01,740
Oh

1355
02:08:59,740 --> 02:09:04,740
Yeah! Come on, let's go!

1356
02:09:29,740 --> 02:09:39,740
Well I'll be there for you

1357
02:09:39,740 --> 02:09:45,740
I wanted to be the one to talk to you

1358
02:09:45,740 --> 02:09:51,740
Why I can't always be left behind

1359
02:09:51,740 --> 02:09:54,740
I know you wanted to say goodbye

1360
02:09:54,740 --> 02:09:57,740
But you said you'd stay, I wonder why

1361
02:09:57,740 --> 02:10:03,740
But I know that I wanna be with you forever and ever

1362
02:10:03,740 --> 02:10:05,740
Hey, you're so true

1363
02:10:05,740 --> 02:10:07,740
Make you feel ashamed once again

1364
02:10:07,740 --> 02:10:11,740
Our hearts will fly to take us back up to the sky

1365
02:10:11,740 --> 02:10:15,740
I even have to bring up the vibes in me

1366
02:10:15,740 --> 02:10:17,740
Bring the vibes out of your heart

1367
02:10:17,740 --> 02:10:19,740
When you've done it, you've taken it

1368
02:10:19,740 --> 02:10:21,740
Where are you?

1369
02:10:21,740 --> 02:10:23,740
Don't you know that it's so true?

1370
02:10:23,740 --> 02:10:30,740
I'll always be there for you my raspberry horn, raspberry horn, raspberry horn

1371
02:10:31,740 --> 02:10:37,740
Gaming radio, so uncensored, that even Tom Brokaw could get a job with us.

1372
02:10:37,740 --> 02:10:39,740
Uh, B-B-Bukawky?

1373
02:10:39,740 --> 02:10:41,740
Orange Lounge Radio.

1374
02:10:41,740 --> 02:10:42,740
Thanks, Tom.

1375
02:10:46,740 --> 02:10:49,740
We're back. Sorry about that, that last song got cut off a little bit.

1376
02:10:49,740 --> 02:10:52,740
I'm sure none of you guys minded that much, because it is voluntary.

1377
02:10:52,740 --> 02:11:03,740
I'm kidding, but apparently one of my macros in IRC happens to control my Winamp, and that is why I'm not going to install more of these crappy scripts into my, uh, MIRC anymore.

1378
02:11:03,740 --> 02:11:12,740
So, apologies for that, but at least you got a little taste there of Politary, June featuring Politary with Raspberry Heart.

1379
02:11:12,740 --> 02:11:16,520
very hard and I so wasn't ready to come back from break damn it oh well that's

1380
02:11:16,520 --> 02:11:22,940
all right what we're gonna do now is we got the TV thingy hooked up do you need

1381
02:11:22,940 --> 02:11:30,100
some time to get that done or is already hooked up for what she's got well I just

1382
02:11:30,100 --> 02:11:34,740
don't know how to set it up that's good we're good to go all right Jamie wants

1383
02:11:34,740 --> 02:11:40,600
to share with us another follow-up to something from last week this has been a

1384
02:11:40,600 --> 02:11:44,680
running thing for like two weeks now is well Jamie I'll let you set this up for

1385
02:11:44,680 --> 02:11:50,500
the listeners what's going on here I brought the Japanese version of Dracula

1386
02:11:50,500 --> 02:11:55,000
X to not turn in the moonlight that came out over here as Castlevania Symphony of

1387
02:11:55,000 --> 02:12:00,220
the night I brought the precursor I brought with me Dracula X for the PC

1388
02:12:00,220 --> 02:12:04,360
engine duo so this is kind of neat because she actually had to bring her

1389
02:12:04,360 --> 02:12:10,200
whole little system here, a TurboDuo, which is ages old for a game system.

1390
02:12:10,200 --> 02:12:13,480
And it's like one of the first CD systems. It's like we're having a classic gaming expo

1391
02:12:13,480 --> 02:12:16,840
in my house right now. It's awesome. Well this game goes for eBay from anywhere

1392
02:12:16,840 --> 02:12:22,960
between $150 to $350. We actually didn't pay for ours, it was used to pay us back when

1393
02:12:22,960 --> 02:12:27,680
someone owed us $100. She picked it up for us in Japan for about

1394
02:12:27,680 --> 02:12:35,120
ten for about a about a hundred dollars okay Wow I'm turning it on now and be

1395
02:12:35,120 --> 02:12:40,380
watching the webcam okay so if you want to check out the webcam go to www.orange

1396
02:12:40,380 --> 02:12:45,140
launch radio.com the webcams right there so look at it people view the old

1397
02:12:45,140 --> 02:12:49,860
schoolness of the super CD-ROM 2 system of course if you're listening to us on

1398
02:12:49,860 --> 02:12:53,820
like a rebroadcast or something such as the one that happens on DDR freak radio

1399
02:12:53,820 --> 02:12:58,180
every Friday night. You don't get to participate along with the webcam because it's not going

1400
02:12:58,180 --> 02:13:02,500
on right now, but at least you get to hear us kind of talk about it. So now, I notice

1401
02:13:02,500 --> 02:13:09,580
the boot-up screen here for this system you've got, it says Super CD-ROM 2 system, like,

1402
02:13:09,580 --> 02:13:16,100
but it says CD-ROM squared. What the hell's the 2?

1403
02:13:16,100 --> 02:13:23,220
I think it's because it's a dual-speed CD. Oh my gosh, it's lightning fast then. It's

1404
02:13:23,220 --> 02:13:24,220
It's a dual-speed CD.

1405
02:13:24,220 --> 02:13:25,220
It's a Saturn.

1406
02:13:25,220 --> 02:13:26,220
Amazing.

1407
02:13:26,220 --> 02:13:27,220
It's blazing fast.

1408
02:13:27,220 --> 02:13:28,220
Anyway, this is the...

1409
02:13:28,220 --> 02:13:36,220
I'm going to go ahead and let the whole intro play through because it's in German.

1410
02:13:36,220 --> 02:13:39,940
And our listeners want nothing more than to hear German right now, I'm sure.

1411
02:13:39,940 --> 02:13:43,100
I might skip through some of it, but...

1412
02:13:43,100 --> 02:13:44,100
I can't hear it.

1413
02:13:44,100 --> 02:13:45,100
Oh, there we go.

1414
02:13:45,100 --> 02:13:46,100
Oh, I hear it.

1415
02:13:46,100 --> 02:13:47,100
Remember the old Konami sound?

1416
02:13:47,100 --> 02:13:50,220
Oh, I used to love that sound when I put it in a Super Nintendo game.

1417
02:13:50,220 --> 02:13:51,220
Beautiful.

1418
02:13:51,220 --> 02:13:52,660
Up, up, down, down, left, right, left, right.

1419
02:13:52,660 --> 02:13:53,660
I hear it a little bit.

1420
02:13:56,660 --> 02:13:57,660
It's quiet, but I hear it.

1421
02:14:03,660 --> 02:14:04,660
There we go.

1422
02:14:08,660 --> 02:14:10,660
So what is this part all about here, Dark Sacra?

1423
02:14:11,660 --> 02:14:13,660
They're sacrificing virgins to bring back Dracula.

1424
02:14:13,660 --> 02:14:15,660
Dracula. Awesome.

1425
02:14:31,660 --> 02:14:37,660
There's the Virgin. This is awesome because it's German with Japanese subtitles.

1426
02:14:37,660 --> 02:14:40,660
And I hope people are saving these for me, please.

1427
02:14:45,660 --> 02:14:47,660
Ooh, there's a good shot of the Virgin there on the webcam.

1428
02:14:50,660 --> 02:14:53,660
Ooh, they killed the Virgin! Oh no, she did. Oh no, they didn't.

1429
02:14:55,660 --> 02:14:57,660
She likes to be a Virgin, huh?

1430
02:14:57,660 --> 02:15:04,660
...

1431
02:15:06,160 --> 02:15:09,460
Clarify something in the chat room, because we don't have motion going on right now.

1432
02:15:09,460 --> 02:15:11,160
Is there a full motion video on this game?

1433
02:15:11,160 --> 02:15:14,160
It's fake motion. You know, like...

1434
02:15:14,160 --> 02:15:16,160
Like Ninja Gaiden cinematics.

1435
02:15:16,160 --> 02:15:17,160
Yeah.

1436
02:15:17,160 --> 02:15:20,160
It has some animation.

1437
02:15:20,160 --> 02:15:22,160
It's spread over stills.

1438
02:15:22,160 --> 02:15:29,160
The only word I understood in the whole thing was flighter mouth, which is fat.

1439
02:15:33,160 --> 02:15:36,160
I understood a heck of a lot more than that.

1440
02:15:36,160 --> 02:15:37,160
Ooh, what did it say?

1441
02:15:37,160 --> 02:15:38,160
It says you suck.

1442
02:15:38,160 --> 02:15:39,160
No.

1443
02:15:39,160 --> 02:15:42,160
No, it actually just said Loki sucks because he doesn't like freeze pops.

1444
02:15:42,160 --> 02:15:47,160
Okay, there's one more bit of the intro I'm going to play after that, the other one I

1445
02:15:47,160 --> 02:15:48,160
showed you.

1446
02:15:48,160 --> 02:15:50,160
And then, here it is.

1447
02:15:50,160 --> 02:15:54,720
Victor the school teacher why do you feel the need to share this with our

1448
02:15:54,720 --> 02:15:59,280
listeners this is the kind of culture they need to be educated in the way to

1449
02:15:59,280 --> 02:16:01,880
the old school

1450
02:16:02,120 --> 02:16:09,560
who is Japanese user like the best bit of jacket of what I love about this game

1451
02:16:09,560 --> 02:16:14,680
is to have a lot of updated Castlevania themes in it oh my god well and updated

1452
02:16:14,680 --> 02:16:18,520
for that time and I'll tell you what for our chat room I'm willing to mp3 the

1453
02:16:18,520 --> 02:16:24,880
a whole CD for you. This music really speaks to me. It sends the message to me that free

1454
02:16:24,880 --> 02:16:31,880
pop is an actual music and it sucks! That's what it says to me. The way it looks on the

1455
02:16:31,880 --> 02:16:38,840
The way it looks on the webcam, it almost looks like the skeletons are dancing.

1456
02:16:38,840 --> 02:16:55,840
Yeah, it's thriller all of a sudden, some of the dicks.

1457
02:16:55,840 --> 02:16:56,840
Dracula.

1458
02:16:56,840 --> 02:16:59,720
Okay, so I'll play a little bit of it.

1459
02:16:59,720 --> 02:17:09,720
But you have to hear, though, Maria, because Maria is a playable character in this, and she's a cheesy little girl in a pink dress, that there's birds.

1460
02:17:09,720 --> 02:17:18,720
Yeah, what the hell is that? That's, you know, maybe I'm just out of touch with the whole, you know, Castlevania slash Dracula series, but what the hell is up with the throwing birds?

1461
02:17:18,720 --> 02:17:22,720
All the characters always had a whip, or like a knife or something.

1462
02:17:22,720 --> 02:17:26,880
whole manly ending where he's marching out of the castle triumphant and Maria

1463
02:17:26,880 --> 02:17:30,480
has one where she's being followed by her little animal friends skipping while

1464
02:17:30,480 --> 02:17:34,900
there's happy music playing. Jamie stop making the grudge noise. And also this

1465
02:17:34,900 --> 02:17:40,040
should sound familiar though. I always love that satanic church music that

1466
02:17:40,040 --> 02:17:46,040
have? See, for anyone who's ever played this on the Super Nintendo, it gives you a hint,

1467
02:17:46,040 --> 02:17:51,720
but this is, you can tell that Symphony of the Night is definitely a secret. You know,

1468
02:17:51,720 --> 02:17:56,920
this would be good music to play, like, say, I don't know, before a certain wedding in

1469
02:17:56,920 --> 02:18:02,240
a church. Dude, that would be great! I should play that before my wedding. So let's see,

1470
02:18:02,240 --> 02:18:12,760
we want Maria or do it Richter Maria sounded like Chun Li there yeah she did

1471
02:18:12,760 --> 02:18:18,480
go get that all right I'll go ahead and start with whatever the hell this

1472
02:18:18,480 --> 02:18:23,560
difficult level is I know I should start with the very beginning just start music

1473
02:18:23,560 --> 02:18:40,880
I'm being soothed by the music. Hey, run away. I'm not soothed. Soothe me. Okay. Jamie's

1474
02:18:40,880 --> 02:18:52,560
playing for a little bit here. And then they ate the minstrels. I get to fight death now.

1475
02:18:52,560 --> 02:19:01,560
So, in the game right now, Jamie is riding on a horseback in carriage or something.

1476
02:19:01,560 --> 02:19:11,560
The graphic, by the way, should look familiar at the beginning of the night.

1477
02:19:11,560 --> 02:19:18,560
And Van Helsing completely ripped the scene off, I might add.

1478
02:19:18,560 --> 02:19:22,540
For people that said that Van Helsing was Castlevania the movie

1479
02:19:23,240 --> 02:19:30,560
Screw you because honestly Van Helsing sucked and a Castlevania movie would be awesome. They would not do that to a Castlevania movie

1480
02:19:31,320 --> 02:19:33,320
Actually, they would that's the problem

1481
02:19:33,800 --> 02:19:41,500
There were no flying vampire babies in Castlevania as far as I'm aware. There were the flying monkeys, but the

1482
02:19:41,500 --> 02:19:46,500
I also want people to pay attention if they happen to make it to the camp.

1483
02:19:46,500 --> 02:19:51,500
The opening graphic you'll remember is exactly the same as it was on Symphony of the Night.

1484
02:19:51,500 --> 02:19:56,500
Which is funny because the opening graphic has a little upside down blue triangle when you play as Richter.

1485
02:19:56,500 --> 02:20:01,500
But when you play as Maria, it's an upside down pink triangle.

1486
02:20:01,500 --> 02:20:06,500
And for you fellow family, aka homos out there, you know what an upside down pink triangle means.

1487
02:20:36,500 --> 02:20:43,500
the Saturn and not turn in the moonlight. I'll do it. I have a Saturn. I have a few

1488
02:20:44,340 --> 02:20:51,020
Saturns actually. I may have a completed save file on that one. Awesome. Now what I love

1489
02:20:51,020 --> 02:20:54,840
about this part of the game too is it looks like she's actually going through the old

1490
02:20:54,840 --> 02:21:01,180
town in Castlevania. And Jamie's saying it is the old town from Castlevania 2, Simon's

1491
02:21:01,180 --> 02:21:05,260
Quest. So for those of you guys that are looking on the webcam right now, you're like, damn

1492
02:21:05,260 --> 02:21:09,260
It looks like the same graphics they had in Simon's Quest. Well, it is.

1493
02:21:19,260 --> 02:21:22,260
Just sounds like a bunch of broken glass everywhere right now.

1494
02:21:22,260 --> 02:21:24,260
Whoa, hey, what was that?

1495
02:21:24,260 --> 02:21:31,260
As I mentioned before when we were watching her play this earlier, it sounds like the same sound effects from Mega Man.

1496
02:21:31,260 --> 02:21:38,260
But they're two different companies. Mega Man is Capcom. Castlevania is Konami. How the hell do you figure?

1497
02:21:43,260 --> 02:21:46,260
There's a hidden place that I can't get to with Richter.

1498
02:21:46,260 --> 02:21:47,260
Don't.

1499
02:21:47,260 --> 02:21:57,620
Anyway, Loki, Castlevania is Konami, Mega Man is Capcom, they cannot share the sound

1500
02:21:57,620 --> 02:22:00,660
effects, the world would explode.

1501
02:22:00,660 --> 02:22:01,660
No.

1502
02:22:01,660 --> 02:22:05,620
What the hell was that?

1503
02:22:05,620 --> 02:22:07,620
That was dinner.

1504
02:22:07,620 --> 02:22:11,900
Shumi says it was the gargoyle.

1505
02:22:11,900 --> 02:22:19,600
See, it's almost like being at somebody's house, watching them play games, except in

1506
02:22:19,600 --> 02:22:28,840
this case you have your back turned and you only get to look once every 30 seconds.

1507
02:22:28,840 --> 02:22:30,240
You just gotta wonder what you're missing.

1508
02:22:30,240 --> 02:22:31,240
Oh, what happened?

1509
02:22:31,240 --> 02:22:32,240
The music stopped.

1510
02:22:32,240 --> 02:22:33,240
Oh, load time.

1511
02:22:33,240 --> 02:22:35,240
Make your own music, yay!

1512
02:22:35,240 --> 02:22:38,440
Oh, here we go.

1513
02:22:38,440 --> 02:22:42,440
Are you fighting the boss right now?

1514
02:22:42,440 --> 02:22:47,440
Yeah, you died last time you fought this boss.

1515
02:22:47,440 --> 02:22:52,440
This sounds 8-bit. This song sounds 8-bit.

1516
02:22:52,440 --> 02:22:57,440
Excuse me.

1517
02:22:58,440 --> 02:23:00,440
Excuse me again.

1518
02:23:00,440 --> 02:23:07,440
I don't know what I ate.

1519
02:23:09,340 --> 02:23:16,340
Loki! Stop that!

1520
02:23:21,320 --> 02:23:25,080
Jamie died. No, she's not dead yet.

1521
02:23:25,080 --> 02:23:27,440
Now she's... Oh!

1522
02:23:27,440 --> 02:23:29,320
Did you hear that sound?

1523
02:23:29,320 --> 02:23:36,320
I swear to God that was the sound it made when you died in like Zelda.

1524
02:23:37,400 --> 02:23:41,400
You need the axe for this. You always needed the axe for the first boss in any

1525
02:23:41,400 --> 02:23:45,840
Castlevania game. What's up with that?

1526
02:23:45,840 --> 02:23:50,160
Alright.

1527
02:23:50,160 --> 02:23:52,760
What?

1528
02:23:52,760 --> 02:23:56,360
Jamie's just trying to get to the next level so you can hear the music because it is

1529
02:23:56,360 --> 02:23:58,880
really awesome.

1530
02:23:58,880 --> 02:24:01,160
And then after that, we're going to go into the FUs of the Week.

1531
02:24:01,160 --> 02:24:04,040
So you guys, by the way, if you're in our chat room right now,

1532
02:24:04,040 --> 02:24:05,880
you can send those FUs of the Week.

1533
02:24:05,880 --> 02:24:08,880
Just send a private message to Sky in the chat room with your FU.

1534
02:24:23,480 --> 02:24:24,800
Did you kill it?

1535
02:24:24,800 --> 02:24:25,400
She killed it.

1536
02:24:25,400 --> 02:24:25,900
Yay.

1537
02:24:25,900 --> 02:24:27,960
I killed it.

1538
02:24:27,960 --> 02:24:34,960
What's up with the disco ball? Like, the crystal that drops on the ceiling is like a little disco ball. It's crazy.

1539
02:24:36,960 --> 02:24:37,960
Makes you want to dance.

1540
02:24:38,960 --> 02:24:42,960
Ooh, it's sparkling. It's a sparkling disco ball.

1541
02:24:43,960 --> 02:24:45,960
And as you can see, it's a red ball with fire in it.

1542
02:24:46,960 --> 02:24:48,960
Well, the cam hasn't updated yet, so I can't see it, but...

1543
02:24:48,960 --> 02:24:49,960
Sorry.

1544
02:24:49,960 --> 02:24:50,960
That's alright.

1545
02:24:52,960 --> 02:24:53,960
I know that noise.

1546
02:24:53,960 --> 02:24:59,960
Believe it or not, I actually like the first level music better on the Super Nintendo version, but all the rest of it's better.

1547
02:25:02,960 --> 02:25:07,960
Alright, now you have to hear the music at the beginning of the stage. It's the whole reason we played this whole first stage.

1548
02:25:07,960 --> 02:25:10,960
I forgot, I also have Sound Test open.

1549
02:25:16,960 --> 02:25:18,960
Sound familiar?

1550
02:25:18,960 --> 02:25:23,960
p0k3smot42o1 the way the bird squawks right at the pause in the song

1551
02:25:48,960 --> 02:25:52,960
Alright. Alright, we're gonna wrap it up for this segment.

1552
02:25:52,960 --> 02:25:56,960
Wait, wait, what? One more thing? Oh, okay.

1553
02:25:56,960 --> 02:26:00,960
Um, I'm gonna actually play a song that I want to be my F music.

1554
02:26:00,960 --> 02:26:04,960
Okay, just for this once.

1555
02:26:04,960 --> 02:26:08,960
Alright, well I'm gonna turn down the volume until you get to that part.

1556
02:26:08,960 --> 02:26:12,960
Well great, what are we supposed to talk about in the meantime? I have no idea.

1557
02:26:12,960 --> 02:26:16,960
Now what are we supposed to do?

1558
02:26:16,960 --> 02:26:23,360
test okay well that that won't take that long no just because this is my favorite

1559
02:26:23,360 --> 02:26:27,220
piece of music in the game and I forgot the sound test existed I guess what I'll

1560
02:26:27,220 --> 02:26:30,000
do for a minute here while I queue up the F use of the week which by the way

1561
02:26:30,000 --> 02:26:33,200
you guys should be sitting in I'll take a moment to plug our spin-off shows

1562
02:26:33,200 --> 02:26:37,820
Monday night on Orange Lounge radio diversion the Orange Lounge radio remix

1563
02:26:37,820 --> 02:26:42,240
show a bunch of your favorite remixes not only just I can hear your computer

1564
02:26:42,240 --> 02:26:45,160
Sorry buddy.

1565
02:26:45,160 --> 02:26:47,040
It is.

1566
02:26:47,040 --> 02:26:48,040
I hear it.

1567
02:26:48,040 --> 02:26:50,840
And so do our listeners.

1568
02:26:50,840 --> 02:26:57,420
Whatever your working on there, I just heard in my speaker.

1569
02:26:57,420 --> 02:26:59,000
Listener!

1570
02:26:59,000 --> 02:27:00,520
Listeners!

1571
02:27:00,520 --> 02:27:02,060
Tell Loki you can hear it.

1572
02:27:02,060 --> 02:27:04,440
Well they're fucking wrong.

1573
02:27:04,440 --> 02:27:06,120
Because look, fliers.

1574
02:27:06,120 --> 02:27:09,120
It's on our computer.

1575
02:27:09,120 --> 02:27:10,640
Try it again.

1576
02:27:10,640 --> 02:27:11,640
I don't hear it now.

1577
02:27:11,640 --> 02:27:17,920
I hear it oh no that was the TV right there okay but I'm telling you I heard

1578
02:27:17,920 --> 02:27:22,520
whatever this thing was it's uh it's you're doing it I can tell it is anyway

1579
02:27:22,520 --> 02:27:27,880
found it you guys don't care anyway not yet not yet yeah not yet keep it down

1580
02:27:27,880 --> 02:27:35,160
God we're gonna get into the F use of the week oh yeah before I fit I needed

1581
02:27:35,160 --> 02:27:41,000
to talk to keep finishing up our spin-off programming all right Tuesday

1582
02:27:41,000 --> 02:27:45,400
night pump up the volume 7 o'clock or what says 730 for show but 645 is for

1583
02:27:45,400 --> 02:27:48,640
pre-show Thursday night outside the box 7 o'clock when we feel like doing a show

1584
02:27:48,640 --> 02:27:52,240
we do one all right now I can do Jamie why do we have to do the F use of the

1585
02:27:52,240 --> 02:27:55,280
week every week because we're angry but this music is too happy to be angry

1586
02:27:55,280 --> 02:27:57,400
about

1587
02:27:57,400 --> 02:28:13,840
um I'm angry about the woman with the cookies okay this is the only thing I'm really angry

1588
02:28:13,840 --> 02:28:21,920
about there was this couple of girls not be posting a link in the chat room soon but they

1589
02:28:21,920 --> 02:28:25,480
went around their neighborhood passing out cookies and they were leaving them on doorsteps

1590
02:28:25,480 --> 02:28:30,560
of surprises. This one woman sued them for causing her anxiety because they knocked on

1591
02:28:30,560 --> 02:28:36,280
the door, she didn't answer, and so they left them and ran as a surprise. Well, they offered

1592
02:28:36,280 --> 02:28:40,760
to pay her medical damages, so she did apparently get checked into the hospital for nearly having

1593
02:28:40,760 --> 02:28:47,760
a heart attack or something. And instead, she sued them for the punitive damages. Well,

1594
02:28:48,520 --> 02:28:54,720
she didn't win that, but she did win what the girls offered her anyway. So, it's a big

1595
02:28:54,720 --> 02:29:01,720
Also, a big F.U. to all of you school children who do not believe in the goddamn first amendment.

1596
02:29:01,720 --> 02:29:12,720
There was a survey done saying that something like 80% of students I think should believe the government has control over our public media.

1597
02:29:12,720 --> 02:29:14,720
That's in direct violation of the first amendment.

1598
02:29:14,720 --> 02:29:17,720
We also don't know how to properly dispose of the flag either.

1599
02:29:17,720 --> 02:29:19,720
I think that vibrating is illegal.

1600
02:29:19,720 --> 02:29:23,720
Um, I think that that's really stupid.

1601
02:29:23,720 --> 02:29:27,720
Just a big F-you to general ignorance of damn near everybody.

1602
02:29:27,720 --> 02:29:31,720
And I blame their parents. That's it.

1603
02:29:31,720 --> 02:29:35,720
Loki's turn!

1604
02:29:35,720 --> 02:29:39,720
I want to get this cold, because I've had a sore throat for like

1605
02:29:39,720 --> 02:29:43,720
an entire week, and that's really the only symptom that I have from that being congested.

1606
02:29:43,720 --> 02:29:47,720
So, that kind of sucks, because talking on the phone

1607
02:29:47,720 --> 02:29:54,440
all day at work, and he just irritates it, and that's no picnic. And then, fuck you to

1608
02:29:54,440 --> 02:30:01,440
stupid, lame-ass people with cell phones. God damn it, I want a law to be passed where

1609
02:30:01,440 --> 02:30:06,240
people cannot drive with cell phones. In fact, there was a fucking study done that people

1610
02:30:06,240 --> 02:30:10,440
are more dangerous driving with cell phones than they would be intoxicated.

1611
02:30:10,440 --> 02:30:11,760
You're making it illegal.

1612
02:30:11,760 --> 02:30:14,760
Thank God! Because you know what? People can't fucking do it.

1613
02:30:14,760 --> 02:30:18,560
I've been in a car with you talking on your cell phone.

1614
02:30:18,560 --> 02:30:24,120
I just use speakerphone. Doesn't matter, even, even with speakerphone, there's still the

1615
02:30:24,120 --> 02:30:28,840
reaction time is much worse. The impending, although, was supposed to make provisions for hands-free.

1616
02:30:28,840 --> 02:30:34,160
So, you know what? So that goes for all you women out there driving those SUVs

1617
02:30:34,160 --> 02:30:38,080
and with those stupid cell phones. Ha! You can't do it any longer!

1618
02:30:38,080 --> 02:30:41,120
So, to hell with you people. Anyways,

1619
02:30:41,120 --> 02:30:48,120
Then also, um, fuck you to the goddamn Indian casinos, actually, because, you know, I think

1620
02:30:48,120 --> 02:30:52,200
it's quite funny that people go there and spend all their money, oh, look at, this is

1621
02:30:52,200 --> 02:30:57,080
as nice because they have, you know, all this, we can go gamble and stuff, but guess what,

1622
02:30:57,080 --> 02:31:01,120
you don't win, they're just doing a reverse rapeage on you, okay, they're just gonna rape

1623
02:31:01,120 --> 02:31:07,340
you of your money, because we raped them of their land, so, you know, I don't feel sorry

1624
02:31:07,340 --> 02:31:14,040
for anyone that goes there and loses all their money. So to hell with them. And I think that's

1625
02:31:14,040 --> 02:31:18,000
pretty much it for now because I can't really think of anything else. There was another

1626
02:31:18,000 --> 02:31:32,320
thing I was thinking of earlier, but it's gone, so that'll be it. My turn. My first

1627
02:31:32,320 --> 02:31:37,480
First F.U. goes to Loki for having two F.U.s that were involving me somehow in some way

1628
02:31:37,480 --> 02:31:42,360
because A. I love talking on my cell phone while I drive and I do it just fine, and B.

1629
02:31:42,360 --> 02:31:48,360
I lost $75 at the casino last night, but I don't care, I had fun and I won $100 the last

1630
02:31:48,360 --> 02:31:49,360
time I was there.

1631
02:31:49,360 --> 02:31:53,260
But on that note, F.U. to the fact that I was not able to keep up my winning streak

1632
02:31:53,260 --> 02:31:56,220
last night, that made me sad, but oh well.

1633
02:31:56,220 --> 02:32:00,540
I had fun while it lasted, even though it didn't last very long, but then again, neither

1634
02:32:00,540 --> 02:32:01,540
do orgasms.

1635
02:32:01,540 --> 02:32:05,540
Um, what else did I give an FU to?

1636
02:32:05,540 --> 02:32:10,040
Uh, an FU to just, like, hangovers. That's a big one.

1637
02:32:10,040 --> 02:32:19,540
Uh, an FU to drama in general, because there's just drama sometimes, and it makes things messy, and that's all I can say about that, really.

1638
02:32:21,040 --> 02:32:26,040
Let's move on. Let's talk to some of the other folks that are here in studio. Angel?

1639
02:32:26,040 --> 02:32:34,040
All right, uh, F.U. to my instructor, because, uh, I'm saying something I did- or, saying I did something that I didn't do.

1640
02:32:34,040 --> 02:32:36,040
And that's all that needs to be said about that.

1641
02:32:36,040 --> 02:32:43,040
Uh, F.U. to myself for not giving myself enough sleep during the week. I think that happens to all of us at one point or another.

1642
02:32:43,040 --> 02:32:49,040
Uh, and other than that, uh, not much, because I'm not really that angsty.

1643
02:32:49,040 --> 02:32:52,040
But then again, when am I ever that angsty?

1644
02:32:52,040 --> 02:32:56,040
Mmm, you've been like borderline angsty, I've seen.

1645
02:32:56,040 --> 02:33:00,040
Alright. Uhh, bugged.

1646
02:33:00,040 --> 02:33:04,040
Just a nice little FU to low-key about freeze-pop.

1647
02:33:04,040 --> 02:33:08,040
You demob-ass. He just will not let that drop!

1648
02:33:08,040 --> 02:33:12,040
He will not drop the freeze-pop grudge.

1649
02:33:12,040 --> 02:33:16,040
Oh boy. We're not supposed to drop demob-ass, everyone's supposed to say it.

1650
02:33:16,040 --> 02:33:20,040
It's gonna be the next... Deathcake.

1651
02:33:20,040 --> 02:33:22,040
What the fuck is Deathcake?

1652
02:33:23,040 --> 02:33:25,040
Is it an Eddie-user? Oh, okay.

1653
02:33:26,040 --> 02:33:30,040
We brought up the cake or death with the Vicar or Die and Deathcake.

1654
02:33:33,040 --> 02:33:36,040
I thought you had a response to that look, that's why I gave you the mic.

1655
02:33:36,040 --> 02:33:38,040
Alright, is that it, Bug?

1656
02:33:38,040 --> 02:33:39,040
Yeah.

1657
02:33:39,040 --> 02:33:41,040
Alright. Chat room time!

1658
02:33:41,040 --> 02:33:44,040
Let's see what the folks on the chat room have to say. Yeah, I know, who cares.

1659
02:33:44,040 --> 02:33:50,760
illusion says F you to Jamster for just being Jamster and being on every

1660
02:33:50,760 --> 02:33:56,000
commercial break you know who owns Jamster who you got to be kidding no

1661
02:33:56,000 --> 02:34:02,060
they're a subsidiary of Versailles Jesus okay here you go guys there's actually a

1662
02:34:02,060 --> 02:34:05,900
petition on the internet to stop Jamster and I would urge you all to sign it even

1663
02:34:05,900 --> 02:34:09,480
though I'm not huge on internet petitions this is one I can believe in I

1664
02:34:09,480 --> 02:34:13,880
don't care if it has like minimal impact if we can stop one Jamster commercial

1665
02:34:13,880 --> 02:34:16,880
We've done our job.

1666
02:34:16,880 --> 02:34:19,880
Illusion also says, an F you to Shakey's.

1667
02:34:19,880 --> 02:34:22,880
Stopping their karaoke right before my friends and I got there.

1668
02:34:22,880 --> 02:34:24,880
So we didn't get to do Love Shack again.

1669
02:34:24,880 --> 02:34:28,880
Hey, that's the song that Iguana Girl and I always do, is Love Shack.

1670
02:34:28,880 --> 02:34:32,880
We did it on this show once, actually.

1671
02:34:32,880 --> 02:34:37,880
KK Slider says, F you to Final Fantasy XI, taking my life.

1672
02:34:37,880 --> 02:34:42,880
I sympathize. What, Jamie? What did you say to KK Slider?

1673
02:34:42,880 --> 02:34:43,880
Oh.

1674
02:34:43,880 --> 02:34:44,880
Addict.

1675
02:34:44,880 --> 02:34:45,880
Jamie says, Addict.

1676
02:34:45,880 --> 02:34:50,920
AznBuddyPaul says, F you to heartbreakers.

1677
02:34:50,920 --> 02:34:55,620
There have been like two gazillion breakups lately.

1678
02:34:55,620 --> 02:34:58,880
You just, maybe you just a playa.

1679
02:34:58,880 --> 02:35:06,320
Sephiroth1215 says, F you to no service pack 8 yet and no 2DX in America yet even though

1680
02:35:06,320 --> 02:35:08,560
I have a feeling it will be soon.

1681
02:35:08,560 --> 02:35:10,280
Song pack, I always say service pack.

1682
02:35:10,280 --> 02:35:12,640
Song pack 8.

1683
02:35:12,640 --> 02:35:18,480
Sephiroth1215 also says, and f you for no outside the box once again, I have more fun

1684
02:35:18,480 --> 02:35:19,480
on that show.

1685
02:35:19,480 --> 02:35:22,600
Well, I'm sure the others are pleased to hear that.

1686
02:35:22,600 --> 02:35:28,080
What can I say, real life gets in the way sometimes, we'll see, we'll see what happens.

1687
02:35:28,080 --> 02:35:32,600
Legend of Zaku says, f you to the fact I'm still unemployed, f you to wasting away my

1688
02:35:32,600 --> 02:35:37,360
body by not eating right, thus losing my stamina when playing DDR, and f you to Valentine's

1689
02:35:37,360 --> 02:35:41,240
Day coming up next week, and me still not having a Valentine.

1690
02:35:41,240 --> 02:35:48,240
Jaded2005 says, F you to my computer for acting weird at the worst possible time yesterday

1691
02:35:48,560 --> 02:35:53,560
while playing Doom 3. And what time would that be?

1692
02:35:53,560 --> 02:36:00,560
Flaronay says, F you to the Super Bowl. Oh no, I'm sorry. I didn't read this right.

1693
02:36:03,840 --> 02:36:08,840
It says, F you to the Super Bow movement in parentheses. F you to the Super Bow.

1694
02:36:08,840 --> 02:36:12,840
I think I had one of those earlier.

1695
02:36:12,840 --> 02:36:16,840
And who won? The Patriots or the Eagles?

1696
02:36:16,840 --> 02:36:20,840
The Wet Ones.

1697
02:36:20,840 --> 02:36:24,840
One FU for tonight.

1698
02:36:24,840 --> 02:36:28,840
FU to EvilMaoki2Dx for making me spit water on the wall

1699
02:36:28,840 --> 02:36:32,840
so many times every time he sent me pictures.

1700
02:36:32,840 --> 02:36:36,840
Would those be 4chan pictures?

1701
02:36:36,840 --> 02:36:42,840
directed at certain people, but that, you know, I can tell that, you know, that's a light-hearted F.U., so those are okay.

1702
02:36:42,840 --> 02:36:46,840
I know who won the Super Bowl movement, it was the Browns.

1703
02:36:46,840 --> 02:36:52,840
You're welcome.

1704
02:36:52,840 --> 02:36:57,840
Do I have to come back next week? I thought Lanky Sal made the worst jokes possible.

1705
02:36:57,840 --> 02:37:01,840
Where do you think he learned them from?

1706
02:37:01,840 --> 02:37:07,840
VX JasonXV, resident webmaster and slave boy will be his official title with the new business structure.

1707
02:37:07,840 --> 02:37:13,840
FU to work, constant FU to work. I don't like all the workload being pushed off on me.

1708
02:37:17,840 --> 02:37:21,840
Right Shannon Joyce says, Joyce says FU to the world.

1709
02:37:21,840 --> 02:37:32,840
And EvilMaoki2Dx would like to say, one quick FU for Ragnarok Online. Taking my life away.

1710
02:37:32,840 --> 02:37:41,840
Korean knock-off. I miss Ragnarok. Korean life-sucking game, right?

1711
02:37:41,840 --> 02:37:49,840
What? Ragnarok? Yeah, Ragnarok's another one of those life-sucking MMORPGs that you play and you start going,

1712
02:37:49,840 --> 02:37:51,840
How did I ever get into this in the first place?

1713
02:37:51,840 --> 02:37:57,840
I did like Ragnarok, though. It was so cute. I will play Ragnarok, too, probably.

1714
02:37:57,840 --> 02:38:02,840
And people that know me know that I don't really have a whole lot of time for those other MMORPGs,

1715
02:38:02,840 --> 02:38:05,840
but I will give Ragnarok Online 2 a chance.

1716
02:38:05,840 --> 02:38:08,840
It was adorable.

1717
02:38:08,840 --> 02:38:12,600
I'm sorry, I still had that picture for the longest time on my phone

1718
02:38:12,600 --> 02:38:17,160
of your mage and my assassin. Seriously, where else could me,

1719
02:38:17,160 --> 02:38:20,720
a guy, get a character with red spiky hair like I have in real life sometimes

1720
02:38:20,720 --> 02:38:25,040
and then get a big purple bow to wear in my hair? That bow gave me plus one intelligence.

1721
02:38:25,040 --> 02:38:28,160
What other MMORPG will let me wear a big purple

1722
02:38:28,160 --> 02:38:32,480
feminine bow in my hair? And I never did get one of the huge ass ribbons

1723
02:38:32,480 --> 02:38:36,000
though, that's what made me sad. You know, I had almost got you one until you said that you

1724
02:38:36,000 --> 02:38:41,200
quit. I might have come back just for the big ribbon.

1725
02:38:41,200 --> 02:38:45,080
Wasn't there a cake song about that?

1726
02:38:45,080 --> 02:38:50,360
I don't, a ribbon? Pretty pink ribbon or something like that?

1727
02:38:50,360 --> 02:38:54,920
Something like that, I don't know. Alright, we're gonna go to

1728
02:38:54,920 --> 02:38:58,880
another break here when we come back. We're gonna head on over to

1729
02:38:58,880 --> 02:39:02,440
DDR Freak and check out our DDR

1730
02:39:02,440 --> 02:39:05,620
chit-chat post of the week and we're gonna chit-chat about it a little bit

1731
02:39:05,620 --> 02:39:10,360
here in studio as well. So we're gonna do that when we come back after this break

1732
02:39:10,360 --> 02:39:17,320
featuring some more music from 2DX Red and we're gonna start it off with... we'll

1733
02:39:17,320 --> 02:39:21,640
start off with a song that you actually saw in 8th style as well if you picked

1734
02:39:21,640 --> 02:39:25,000
up the home version but it's a good song. It really is a good song and it's worth

1735
02:39:25,000 --> 02:39:29,080
playing again. It's Spiral Galaxy. Enjoy guys. We'll be back with more Orange

1736
02:39:29,080 --> 02:39:36,080
launch radio.

1737
02:41:59,080 --> 02:42:01,080
Can I live?

1738
02:42:03,080 --> 02:42:05,080
You've changed me now.

1739
02:42:05,080 --> 02:42:07,080
I can fly.

1740
02:42:07,080 --> 02:42:14,080
It's my life, it's my life, it's my life.

1741
02:43:07,080 --> 02:43:35,080
It's my life, it's my life It's my life, it's my life

1742
02:45:05,080 --> 02:45:12,080
And now, let's listen to the music.

1743
02:45:35,080 --> 02:45:40,240
into an Orange Lounge Radio staff meeting as they debate some of the new

1744
02:45:40,240 --> 02:45:43,280
programming coming to Orange Lounge Radio.

1745
02:45:43,280 --> 02:45:47,780
Um, Jamie, I have a suggestion about some of the music in our Bamani Music & More program.

1746
02:45:47,780 --> 02:45:48,980
Can we talk about that?

1747
02:45:48,980 --> 02:45:51,580
No subject will ever be taboo.

1748
02:45:51,580 --> 02:45:55,580
Well, I was thinking maybe we should move, pump up the volume from Tuesday nights?

1749
02:45:55,580 --> 02:45:58,580
Except, of course, the subject that was just on our discussion.

1750
02:45:58,580 --> 02:46:04,580
Okay, well, what would you think if maybe we cut back on some of the tack music we play on the station?

1751
02:46:04,580 --> 02:46:06,580
I collect your fucking head.

1752
02:46:07,580 --> 02:46:09,580
Just like this fucker here.

1753
02:46:11,580 --> 02:46:14,580
Oh my god, why did you do that to Loki?

1754
02:46:14,580 --> 02:46:18,580
The holic thing on episode 69 was just a joke!

1755
02:46:18,580 --> 02:46:21,580
Now if any of you sons of bitches

1756
02:46:21,580 --> 02:46:23,580
got anything else to say,

1757
02:46:23,580 --> 02:46:25,580
NOW'S THE FUCKING TIME!

1758
02:46:53,580 --> 02:46:57,700
six maybe? I think so. Although that's still one of my favorites.

1759
02:46:57,700 --> 02:47:01,500
You know that's based off an old banner I once saw on DDR Freak and I thought it was

1760
02:47:01,500 --> 02:47:02,700
great. It had a photoshopped...

1761
02:47:02,700 --> 02:47:05,940
It was somebody's signature banner and it said your post... or no, it was something

1762
02:47:05,940 --> 02:47:09,640
that would post in a thread and it said your post makes Captain Jack cry

1763
02:47:09,640 --> 02:47:13,260
and it was a photoshopped image of Captain Jack and his little

1764
02:47:13,260 --> 02:47:16,620
like singer and their mouths were turned upside down

1765
02:47:16,620 --> 02:47:20,660
so it looked like they were frowning and then tears were drawn on. It was so funny.

1766
02:47:20,660 --> 02:47:22,540
I like the one that you made based on

1767
02:47:22,540 --> 02:47:25,680
Dan's old joke with the one-hit wonder. Oh yeah.

1768
02:47:25,680 --> 02:47:29,620
Oh yeah. Because you can sing one-hit wonder to the

1769
02:47:29,620 --> 02:47:33,880
whole thing of Take On Me practically. And you know what? I will open it up to the

1770
02:47:33,880 --> 02:47:37,040
listeners. The listeners have said, can we make promos for you guys?

1771
02:47:37,040 --> 02:47:40,560
Sure! Why the hell not? Make us a promo.

1772
02:47:40,560 --> 02:47:44,480
You could even sneak in your name in there somehow. I don't know.

1773
02:47:44,480 --> 02:47:49,620
Be creative. We don't care. So we're gonna have an unofficial contest and the prize

1774
02:47:49,620 --> 02:47:50,880
if you win the contest

1775
02:47:50,880 --> 02:47:54,560
is you get your promo plate on the air. What? What?

1776
02:47:54,560 --> 02:47:57,760
I will send, we will send you autographed

1777
02:47:57,760 --> 02:48:01,200
of the EX-2 and

1778
02:48:01,200 --> 02:48:04,560
the Max-2, whatever the word...

1779
02:48:04,560 --> 02:48:07,560
The Ultramix-2 and the

1780
02:48:07,560 --> 02:48:12,120
extreme V-rares? Yes. I will send you autographed copies.

1781
02:48:12,120 --> 02:48:16,560
We will send you autographed copies. Alright, we will pick our favorites and we will send them autographed copies

1782
02:48:16,560 --> 02:48:17,400
of the V-rares.

1783
02:48:17,400 --> 02:48:23,400
By us. By us. And whoever else we can dig up. Maybe we can get some DDR Freak friends to sign them, too.

1784
02:48:25,400 --> 02:48:32,400
Granted, it's not as good as the, um, Make Edit Get Porn contest, but it will have to do.

1785
02:48:32,400 --> 02:48:38,400
Did we ever have a winner for that? We didn't even end up... Oh, yeah, that's right. That's right. I remember now. I remember that. That was a long time ago.

1786
02:48:38,400 --> 02:48:43,400
What happened with that? For those who weren't listening back then, what happened with the Make Edit Get Porn contest?

1787
02:48:43,400 --> 02:48:56,400
Well, we did have a winner. And the winner at the time was Dave. Those of you who have been listening to the show forever might remember Dave, how he used to come on and listen in the studio with us.

1788
02:48:56,400 --> 02:48:57,400
How he used to race me home.

1789
02:48:57,400 --> 02:49:03,400
Him and Paul. But, you know, they do not, for some reason, come over anymore.

1790
02:49:03,400 --> 02:49:04,400
We're not cool anymore.

1791
02:49:04,400 --> 02:49:12,400
We're not cool anymore. So, they're probably out screwing girls now, basically. They discovered girls.

1792
02:49:12,400 --> 02:49:14,400
if you're ready to hit or something.

1793
02:49:42,400 --> 02:49:53,440
almost porn, but you know, it's enough. Oh, how I miss the days. Alright. Anyway, free

1794
02:49:53,440 --> 02:50:05,480
porn! Let's get into the DDR chit-chat post of the week. That's right, when we get bored

1795
02:50:05,480 --> 02:50:10,280
on this show and we're desperate for materials, we turn to our buddies over on DDR Freak to

1796
02:50:10,280 --> 02:50:14,760
to provide us with the inspiration we need to keep this show going.

1797
02:50:14,760 --> 02:50:19,400
And we pick a post from DDR Chit Chat and make it our post of the week.

1798
02:50:19,400 --> 02:50:23,920
Now, it was very tempting to use this as the post of the week, which

1799
02:50:23,920 --> 02:50:28,440
actually was suggested to us by Flair O'Nai, which had the subject,

1800
02:50:28,440 --> 02:50:31,480
does this girl worth risking?

1801
02:50:31,480 --> 02:50:35,280
Hi, several months ago, I have signed erotic teen site.

1802
02:50:35,280 --> 02:50:39,160
I have asked owner of this site, and he gave me mail one of the models.

1803
02:50:39,160 --> 02:50:43,600
Her name is Julia, and here her free page.

1804
02:50:43,600 --> 02:50:47,400
How do you think it is possible to have long relation with such models?

1805
02:50:47,400 --> 02:50:52,440
Is it safe to go Ukraine now for meeting?

1806
02:50:52,440 --> 02:50:53,440
But I thought...

1807
02:50:53,440 --> 02:50:59,740
That sounds amazing when you like the Henry Rollins bit about the guy from Hungary.

1808
02:50:59,740 --> 02:51:03,340
You know the problem I have with that post, besides the fact that it doesn't make any

1809
02:51:03,340 --> 02:51:12,180
fucking sense, is that we have to have a little bit of a discussion on the post of the week,

1810
02:51:12,180 --> 02:51:15,900
so that does not work for the post of the week, I apologize.

1811
02:51:15,900 --> 02:51:21,380
Now this was actually, I can't fault this post for wording or grammar or anything, it's

1812
02:51:21,380 --> 02:51:27,060
actually a pretty interesting post, I gotta ask the folks in chat, or the folks not only

1813
02:51:27,060 --> 02:51:30,740
in chat, but the folks in the studio what they think about this one.

1814
02:51:30,740 --> 02:51:34,940
This is a post and it's titled, Middle Finger Usage.

1815
02:51:34,940 --> 02:51:39,540
We've all seen people make use of their middle finger in pictures of their DDR accomplishments.

1816
02:51:39,540 --> 02:51:43,940
What's the significance of this?

1817
02:51:43,940 --> 02:51:47,140
Does it symbolize hate for the song?

1818
02:51:47,140 --> 02:51:50,460
Does it mean the accomplishment was hard to do?

1819
02:51:50,460 --> 02:51:53,860
Are they full of rage and don't know where to let it out?

1820
02:51:53,860 --> 02:51:56,180
Is it the in thing to do?

1821
02:51:56,180 --> 02:51:58,060
If so, why did it become this way?

1822
02:51:58,060 --> 02:52:01,660
Do they want to look like rebels, and are they succeeding?

1823
02:52:01,660 --> 02:52:04,800
Are they conformists who don't even know the significance?

1824
02:52:04,800 --> 02:52:10,820
I suspect a combination of the last three, but I don't really know.

1825
02:52:10,820 --> 02:52:14,180
It's telling the song, I fucked your mom, and that's it.

1826
02:52:14,180 --> 02:52:15,180
That's what it is.

1827
02:52:15,180 --> 02:52:20,060
More or less, you know, it's like, ha, I fucked your mom, and I triple-aged you.

1828
02:52:20,060 --> 02:52:21,060
The end.

1829
02:52:21,060 --> 02:52:23,940
Is that where the expression, I triple-aged your mom, comes from?

1830
02:52:23,940 --> 02:52:24,940
Because I've heard that.

1831
02:52:24,940 --> 02:52:27,860
I've read that expression a lot on some of the message boards, and I always read that

1832
02:52:27,860 --> 02:52:33,100
and go, God, you're 14. To be honest, I'm just totally guessing. I have no fucking clue

1833
02:52:33,100 --> 02:52:39,220
why. I think it's because kids are stupid. I mean, because maybe flashing your penis

1834
02:52:39,220 --> 02:52:45,420
is illegal. So, you know, flipping off the camera is like, look at me, I'm hardcore and

1835
02:52:45,420 --> 02:52:48,940
I'm rebellious. I don't know.

1836
02:52:48,940 --> 02:52:52,860
Jamie, are there any pictures of you on the Internet giving the middle finger on a DDR

1837
02:52:52,860 --> 02:52:53,860
machine?

1838
02:52:53,860 --> 02:52:55,740
Um, there have been, actually.

1839
02:52:55,740 --> 02:52:57,940
Why were you given the finger?

1840
02:52:57,940 --> 02:53:01,480
I think I was pissed off at the song.

1841
02:53:01,480 --> 02:53:02,820
It's just a song?

1842
02:53:02,820 --> 02:53:04,720
What did the song do to you?

1843
02:53:04,720 --> 02:53:05,720
It fizzled.

1844
02:53:05,720 --> 02:53:09,140
Fucked her mother.

1845
02:53:09,140 --> 02:53:11,220
Did the song AAA your mom?

1846
02:53:11,220 --> 02:53:14,020
Back in the day, possibly, but not currently.

1847
02:53:14,020 --> 02:53:18,020
Her husband would take exception to that.

1848
02:53:18,020 --> 02:53:19,020
Bugged?

1849
02:53:19,020 --> 02:53:22,340
Now you've given the middle finger to several DDR machines, right?

1850
02:53:22,340 --> 02:53:23,340
Sure why not?

1851
02:53:23,340 --> 02:53:25,720
I could go do that right now.

1852
02:53:25,720 --> 02:53:29,240
But are you just giving the middle finger to the DDR machine because you're like, fucking

1853
02:53:29,240 --> 02:53:30,240
losers or what?

1854
02:53:30,240 --> 02:53:34,360
No, it's because I can't get my zipper down at the same time.

1855
02:53:34,360 --> 02:53:38,240
You're supposed to laugh, dammit.

1856
02:53:38,240 --> 02:53:40,440
Here's a quote from the chat room.

1857
02:53:40,440 --> 02:53:43,260
Wow, that's a really good question.

1858
02:53:43,260 --> 02:53:47,320
And Illusion says, I'm only going to say this because I know Illusion happens to live in

1859
02:53:47,320 --> 02:53:50,120
this same area, so I guess he's including himself.

1860
02:53:50,120 --> 02:53:53,560
Illusion says, all those SoCal people always flip off the camera.

1861
02:53:53,560 --> 02:53:58,400
They look like such dipshits.

1862
02:53:58,400 --> 02:54:00,360
I don't know.

1863
02:54:00,360 --> 02:54:01,360
I don't know why.

1864
02:54:01,360 --> 02:54:04,760
I mean, I flip off the cameras and I flip off the webcam all the time.

1865
02:54:04,760 --> 02:54:05,760
It's just...

1866
02:54:05,760 --> 02:54:10,480
I have a picture of me flipping off people wearing a cast, and then I had the cast cut

1867
02:54:10,480 --> 02:54:13,080
off with hedge-cutters.

1868
02:54:13,080 --> 02:54:16,580
That was one of the few pictures that you posted on Oregon's radio, wasn't it?

1869
02:54:16,580 --> 02:54:20,520
You know, when I flip you guys off on the webcam...

1870
02:54:20,520 --> 02:54:22,000
It's a symbol of love.

1871
02:54:22,000 --> 02:54:23,000
It is.

1872
02:54:23,000 --> 02:54:26,500
symbol of love because what I really fucking love you well what is the word

1873
02:54:26,500 --> 02:54:31,240
fuck really mean though it means I want to make love to you so when I flip you

1874
02:54:31,240 --> 02:54:34,760
guys off on the webcam I'm saying I want to make love to you and when they flip

1875
02:54:34,760 --> 02:54:38,560
you off when they're playing DDR they're really saying I want to make sweet sweet

1876
02:54:38,560 --> 02:54:44,080
love to that song I just played that's not the way I always understand it

1877
02:54:44,080 --> 02:54:48,840
especially when there's a lot of cursing that doesn't go with the love you know

1878
02:54:48,840 --> 02:54:56,440
I've triple A'd that song and I'd like to make sweet sweet love to your mom or something,

1879
02:54:56,440 --> 02:54:58,540
I don't know.

1880
02:54:58,540 --> 02:55:02,900
Maybe Loki just does it because he heard freeze pop over the intercom when the picture was

1881
02:55:02,900 --> 02:55:03,900
taken.

1882
02:55:03,900 --> 02:55:04,900
What now?

1883
02:55:04,900 --> 02:55:05,900
To my best!

1884
02:55:05,900 --> 02:55:06,900
I completely missed that.

1885
02:55:06,900 --> 02:55:07,900
Yes, yes you did.

1886
02:55:07,900 --> 02:55:08,900
It's funny.

1887
02:55:08,900 --> 02:55:17,860
I'm sure it wasn't, but that's okay.

1888
02:55:17,860 --> 02:55:19,240
And we have a question from the chat room.

1889
02:55:19,240 --> 02:55:22,140
Flair O'Nai says, you want to make love to me, Sky?

1890
02:55:22,140 --> 02:55:24,300
In reality, yes, I want to make love to all of you.

1891
02:55:24,300 --> 02:55:25,720
And there's a good reason for that,

1892
02:55:25,720 --> 02:55:29,100
because you guys are what have made this station so damn great.

1893
02:55:29,100 --> 02:55:32,060
And for that, I just want to make love to all of you.

1894
02:55:32,060 --> 02:55:34,060
For those of you guys that are in the chat room

1895
02:55:34,060 --> 02:55:37,580
and support this show, hey, DDR Angel's running away right now.

1896
02:55:37,580 --> 02:55:38,780
Why are you doing that?

1897
02:55:38,780 --> 02:55:42,100
I didn't mean now, just someday.

1898
02:55:42,100 --> 02:55:44,580
In the metaphorical sense, that doesn't mean I actually

1899
02:55:44,580 --> 02:55:45,700
want to take your clothes.

1900
02:55:45,700 --> 02:55:47,420
In the metaphorical sense.

1901
02:55:47,420 --> 02:55:51,420
You know what I'm saying? Jamie, don't you want to make love to all our listeners in the metaphorical sense?

1902
02:55:51,420 --> 02:55:53,420
Hell no!

1903
02:55:53,420 --> 02:55:59,420
Do you know where some of those people have been? Some have been with your mother!

1904
02:55:59,420 --> 02:56:03,420
Do we have any, like, hot Asian, big-breasted chicks listening? Because...

1905
02:56:03,420 --> 02:56:04,420
I am.

1906
02:56:04,420 --> 02:56:06,420
Otherwise, you know.

1907
02:56:06,420 --> 02:56:10,420
I am, and you can't prove that I'm not.

1908
02:56:10,420 --> 02:56:18,420
Yeah, I think I can. But anyways, um, cause I know it's mostly adolescent guys, and I'm not into that, so.

1909
02:56:22,420 --> 02:56:35,420
We need to be hitting up our big breasted Asian demographic, god dammit. Cause this is what we're, like, really hurting on, is the big breasted female Asian demographic. You know, age range of, you know, 21 to 28.

1910
02:56:35,420 --> 02:56:41,420
Well, maybe you need to think of a show that would cater to the big breasted Asian women. Think about this one.

1911
02:56:41,420 --> 02:56:44,420
Big booby chicks.

1912
02:56:44,420 --> 02:56:48,420
That'd be a BBC show.

1913
02:56:48,420 --> 02:56:58,420
Well, I could think of a couple ideas for a show. However, they would be very inappropriate for the radio.

1914
02:56:58,420 --> 02:57:00,420
Like this isn't?

1915
02:57:00,420 --> 02:57:07,260
Well, I'm trying to back away from, you know, making, you know, excessive amounts of racial

1916
02:57:07,260 --> 02:57:08,780
stereotypes and...

1917
02:57:08,780 --> 02:57:11,660
Other people have an idea, ask G4 how they did it.

1918
02:57:11,660 --> 02:57:16,860
Now Rai-Chan and Joyce are sitting there in the chat room and they're saying, I've got

1919
02:57:16,860 --> 02:57:19,620
the hot, hot Asian over here.

1920
02:57:19,620 --> 02:57:24,300
And now they're claiming that there's no, they said, if you don't require big breasts,

1921
02:57:24,300 --> 02:57:25,980
but I'm thinking the breasts are just fine.

1922
02:57:25,980 --> 02:57:28,620
I'm thinking that they're just being a little self-deprecating.

1923
02:57:28,620 --> 02:57:34,020
two women over there listening. Hey, that's two out of, you know, whatever. That's a good

1924
02:57:34,020 --> 02:57:44,020
percentage. It's more than one. Yes, Darth Zagre. I'm not commenting. You know what?

1925
02:57:44,020 --> 02:57:49,100
Wise. Very wise. If we have the big boobied Asian women show, we can certainly have the

1926
02:57:49,100 --> 02:57:59,900
pantsless rage show. That's fine. The what? Old joke. You need to, Loki, you seriously

1927
02:57:59,900 --> 02:58:11,060
need to register a site. Just bigbreastedasianchicksonddr.com. Quick, hold his credit card. Maybe our webmaster

1928
02:58:11,060 --> 02:58:17,260
can help us make that happen. You know, it's only like, what, nine dollars or something

1929
02:58:17,260 --> 02:58:21,620
the register domain name. It's really fucking cheap. I'll just have it point to, you know,

1930
02:58:21,620 --> 02:58:33,140
Loki Fusion, so. Anyway, now Rychan and Joyce are arguing about their boobies. I don't know,

1931
02:58:33,140 --> 02:58:36,880
maybe we'll get them on the Skype line another week. Sorry guys, but we do have to bring

1932
02:58:36,880 --> 02:58:40,780
this show to a close. We're getting towards it. Yes, Loki. I mean, not saying that I'm

1933
02:58:40,780 --> 02:58:45,740
hating against, you know, the Asians with smaller breasts. I mean, that's all good.

1934
02:58:45,740 --> 02:58:49,060
you mean? You can't hate on it. Like they say,

1935
02:58:49,060 --> 02:58:52,060
any more than a handful is a waste. So...

1936
02:58:52,060 --> 02:58:56,060
Or is that a mouthful? I can't remember. I think it's a mouthful.

1937
02:58:56,060 --> 02:59:03,500
Yes. And we're getting a post to our website here. It says www.bigbreastedasians.com

1938
02:59:03,500 --> 02:59:07,140
I'm sure that site already exists, people. I'm sure it does.

1939
02:59:07,140 --> 02:59:10,340
Here's the catch though. Big Breasted Asians

1940
02:59:10,340 --> 02:59:14,580
playing DDR is the catch.

1941
02:59:14,580 --> 02:59:18,540
Oh it doesn't... Bigbreastedasians.com doesn't exist?

1942
02:59:18,540 --> 02:59:22,660
Wow.

1943
02:59:22,660 --> 02:59:28,660
We need to register Big Breasted Asians and have it point to Orange Lounge Radio.

1944
02:59:28,660 --> 02:59:35,660
Big Breasted Asian Women Playing DDR.com certainly doesn't have that.

1945
02:59:35,660 --> 02:59:39,500
Alright.

1946
02:59:39,500 --> 02:59:48,500
Loki's gonna work on that. I can't believe Big Breasted Asians isn't registered. Somebody can get us that for Christmas and have it point to Orange Lounge Radio.

1947
02:59:48,500 --> 03:00:03,500
Seriously, I will point that to Orange Lounge Radio if I can do that. It's only a few bucks. I mean, I could do that. That'd be funny.

1948
03:00:03,500 --> 03:00:10,360
Oh, actually, Jason says BigBreastedAsians.com does exist.

1949
03:00:10,360 --> 03:00:11,360
He checked.

1950
03:00:11,360 --> 03:00:14,360
I just checked and it wasn't there.

1951
03:00:14,360 --> 03:00:15,360
It may be registered.

1952
03:00:15,360 --> 03:00:17,560
It may be registered with no website.

1953
03:00:17,560 --> 03:00:20,400
That's probably it then.

1954
03:00:20,400 --> 03:00:22,280
Alright.

1955
03:00:22,280 --> 03:00:27,000
I would have a hard time believing that BigBreastedAsians.com wouldn't exist.

1956
03:00:27,000 --> 03:00:32,040
Now maybe there could be like BigTittied Asians or BigJugged Asians or well, you know what,

1957
03:00:32,040 --> 03:00:36,640
We really need to end this show at this point, I'm thinking.

1958
03:00:36,640 --> 03:00:40,640
In order to do that, we have to go around and get everybody's final thought.

1959
03:00:40,640 --> 03:00:42,560
Bud, your final thought.

1960
03:00:42,560 --> 03:00:43,560
Puppy bowl.

1961
03:00:43,560 --> 03:00:46,920
DDR Angel, your final thought.

1962
03:00:46,920 --> 03:00:52,240
Um, I don't have one, sorry.

1963
03:00:52,240 --> 03:00:56,420
Dark sa- or, actually, Loki, your final thought.

1964
03:00:56,420 --> 03:01:01,320
I hope that battery doesn't explode when I'm done charging it and plug it into the monitor,

1965
03:01:01,320 --> 03:01:05,320
So it's like I've had really bad luck with batteries.

1966
03:01:05,320 --> 03:01:07,400
Lick it first.

1967
03:01:07,400 --> 03:01:10,800
My final thought is you better take that shit outside when you plug it in the first time

1968
03:01:10,800 --> 03:01:12,840
in case you start any fires.

1969
03:01:12,840 --> 03:01:14,040
DarkSakura, your final thought.

1970
03:01:14,040 --> 03:01:20,520
Japanese games that have intros in German are awesome.

1971
03:01:20,520 --> 03:01:24,280
Tonight's final word, I'm going to give the final word of the show tonight to DDR Angel

1972
03:01:24,280 --> 03:01:28,720
because she hasn't said shit tonight, so she needs to get at least one word in.

1973
03:01:28,720 --> 03:01:30,560
And thank you guys very much for listening.

1974
03:01:30,560 --> 03:01:33,680
We will see you next week, same bat time, same bat channel.

1975
03:01:33,680 --> 03:01:35,780
Thanks a lot for tuning in and supporting Orange Lounge Radio.

1976

1979
03:01:44,940 --> 03:01:45,940
We appreciate it.

1980
03:01:45,940 --> 03:01:46,940
Love you guys.

1981
03:01:46,940 --> 03:01:47,940
All right, Angel.

1982
03:01:47,940 --> 03:01:48,940
Tonight's final word.

1983
03:01:48,940 --> 03:01:49,940
Bye.

1984
03:01:49,940 --> 03:01:56,280

1988
03:02:13,280 --> 03:02:17,280
Hi, I'm Cornolio. I need TV for my bunghole.

1989
03:02:17,280 --> 03:02:19,280
Screw you!

1990
03:02:19,280 --> 03:02:21,280
Do not make my bunghole angry.

1991
03:02:21,280 --> 03:02:23,280
Do you have any olio?

1992
03:02:23,280 --> 03:02:29,600
Ah, and, Gunterbud, Lord of the Mountains, behold my Patrick Duffy leg!

1993
03:02:29,600 --> 03:02:30,720
Are you threatening me?

1994
03:02:30,720 --> 03:02:32,320
Go home, you little dildo!

1995
03:02:32,320 --> 03:02:33,680
You will give me TV!

1996
03:02:33,680 --> 03:02:34,640
Bongoglio?

1997
03:02:34,640 --> 03:02:36,240
Kick him in the nads, Beavis.

1998
03:02:36,240 --> 03:02:36,720
Aye.

1999
03:02:36,720 --> 03:02:38,240
Does not your scrotum need kicking?

2000
03:02:41,120 --> 03:02:43,120
Oh my God! They killed Kenny!

2001
03:02:43,760 --> 03:02:45,120
You bastard!

2002
03:02:45,120 --> 03:02:46,960
You piece of crap! I'll kill you!

2003
03:02:46,960 --> 03:03:05,320
Thank you very much for listening, and we'll see you next week.

2004
03:03:16,960 --> 03:03:34,480
Another night gone here at the Orange Lounge Studio.

2005
03:03:34,480 --> 03:03:36,640
Another work week about ready to start.

2006
03:03:36,640 --> 03:03:39,000
Another school week about ready to start.

2007
03:03:39,000 --> 03:03:40,000
Sadness.

2008
03:03:40,000 --> 03:03:41,000
What?

2009
03:03:41,000 --> 03:03:43,000
What, Angel?

2010
03:03:43,000 --> 03:03:50,880
I just whispered the death the death game and he didn't even say anything because I

2011
03:03:50,880 --> 03:03:58,720
