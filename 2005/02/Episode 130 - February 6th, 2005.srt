125
00:17:23,645 --> 00:17:24,025

00:17:24,445 --> 00:17:24,785
[SPEAKER_15]: Agiha.

127
00:17:25,145 --> 00:17:25,485
[SPEAKER_25]: I think so.

128
00:17:26,146 --> 00:17:30,267
[SPEAKER_25]: Before that, the song Sphere from 2DX11, pretty cool song.

129
00:17:30,987 --> 00:17:37,689
[SPEAKER_25]: EVO66, which by the way, is by the same group that did North from 2DX4 style.

130
00:17:37,709 --> 00:17:38,569
[SPEAKER_25]: You guys remember that song?

131
00:17:38,629 --> 00:17:46,231
[SPEAKER_25]: It was like very, I don't know, like Renaissance Fair Rave type song.

132
00:17:47,446 --> 00:17:49,868
[SPEAKER_25]: I really don't know how to explain that song.

133
00:17:50,769 --> 00:17:52,430
[SPEAKER_25]: Wait, let me play a little bit of North.

134
00:17:52,490 --> 00:17:55,572
[SPEAKER_25]: Here's a little clip of North from 2DX4 style.

135
00:17:58,054 --> 00:18:05,800
[SPEAKER_25]: It's kind of like happy.

136
00:18:10,163 --> 00:18:11,184
[SPEAKER_25]: Like flute or something.

137
00:18:11,284 --> 00:18:13,446
[SPEAKER_25]: And then they go from that to this.

138
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:22,841
[SPEAKER_25]: I guess this is a little more Ravish.

139
00:18:22,881 --> 00:18:23,261
[SPEAKER_25]: I don't know.

140
00:18:28,643 --> 00:18:28,963
[SPEAKER_25]: I don't know.

141
00:18:29,143 --> 00:18:31,204

00:18:31,284 --> 00:18:32,085
[SPEAKER_25]: I have no idea.

143
00:18:32,905 --> 00:18:33,185
[SPEAKER_25]: All right.

144
00:18:34,145 --> 00:18:38,387
[SPEAKER_25]: And then starting that set off, Injection of Love, the song where she says, Fook me.

145
00:18:40,508 --> 00:18:42,229
[SPEAKER_25]: What the fook is going on over there, you guys?

146
00:18:43,329 --> 00:18:44,330
[SPEAKER_25]: We're just fooking around.

147
00:18:44,570 --> 00:18:44,870

[SPEAKER_25]: How was your day?

158
00:19:01,744 --> 00:19:04,946
[SPEAKER_25]: Your chance to catch up with us and what we've been doing.

159
00:19:05,306 --> 00:19:06,627
[SPEAKER_25]: It's better than LiveJournal, really.

160
00:19:06,967 --> 00:19:07,688
[SPEAKER_25]: Jamie, how was your week?

161
00:19:07,728 --> 00:19:10,109
[SPEAKER_07]: How was your day?

162
00:19:10,189 --> 00:19:11,890
[SPEAKER_07]: My week was pretty okay.

163
00:19:12,751 --> 00:19:13,931
[SPEAKER_07]: It was... Work was great.

164
00:19:14,572 --> 00:19:15,432
[SPEAKER_07]: I love my job now.

165
00:19:16,673 --> 00:19:16,953
[SPEAKER_07]: You know...

166
00:19:17,850 --> 00:19:20,712
[SPEAKER_07]: I made a comment to my boss that I had no job stress.

167
00:19:21,032 --> 00:19:22,513
[SPEAKER_07]: He was like, what was this business?

168
00:19:22,533 --> 00:19:27,075
[SPEAKER_07]: I was like, no, there's a difference between having a lot of work to do and having emotional stress.

169
00:19:27,576 --> 00:19:28,876
[SPEAKER_07]: And I don't have any of that at my job now.

170
00:19:29,097 --> 00:19:30,097
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's been really great.

171
00:19:30,697 --> 00:19:31,938
[SPEAKER_07]: I can go to work happy.

172
00:19:32,058 --> 00:19:33,019
[SPEAKER_07]: I can leave happy.

173
00:19:33,639 --> 00:19:35,100
[SPEAKER_07]: I can be happy all day at work.

174
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:36,361
[SPEAKER_07]: How many people can say that?

175
00:19:36,541 --> 00:19:38,702
[SPEAKER_25]: When I got my last promotion, I felt the exact same way.

176
00:19:38,762 --> 00:19:45,486
[SPEAKER_25]: I went from feeling useless to feeling good about what I did.

177
00:19:46,444 --> 00:19:48,425
[SPEAKER_25]: I literally felt useless in my old position.

178
00:19:48,545 --> 00:19:51,166
[SPEAKER_07]: In my old position I had the evil VP, who I hope dies.

179
00:19:51,566 --> 00:19:52,807
[SPEAKER_25]: I liked everybody I worked with.

180
00:19:53,487 --> 00:19:58,449
[SPEAKER_25]: I don't think I've really worked with any bad people unless they were people who weren't there very long.

181
00:19:58,729 --> 00:19:59,789
[SPEAKER_07]: I enjoyed my entire team.

182
00:20:00,029 --> 00:20:07,312
[SPEAKER_25]: Yeah, I've had the fortunacy of working with good people, but that doesn't always mean that I was doing the best kind of work, you know what I mean?

183
00:20:07,594 --> 00:20:08,616
[SPEAKER_07]: My work is really easy.

184
00:20:08,656 --> 00:20:14,186
[SPEAKER_07]: It's all spreadsheets and computer stuff that I don't have to really... I can listen to my music.

185
00:20:14,247 --> 00:20:17,192
[SPEAKER_07]: As long as I can listen to my music and do my work, I'm a happy bunny.

186
00:20:17,292 --> 00:20:17,853
[SPEAKER_25]: And what do you do?

187
00:20:17,893 --> 00:20:19,236
[SPEAKER_25]: You listen to Phantom of the Opera while you work?

188
00:20:19,376 --> 00:20:19,937
[SPEAKER_07]: Dude, I was.

189
00:20:20,769 --> 00:20:24,290
[SPEAKER_07]: and one of my co-workers came up and goes, oh my god, this is awesome.

190
00:20:24,610 --> 00:20:26,571
[SPEAKER_07]: So which track are you on?

191
00:20:26,591 --> 00:20:29,932
[SPEAKER_07]: She tried to figure out what track I was listening to by the playlist.

192
00:20:30,112 --> 00:20:36,195
[SPEAKER_25]: I want to know, is it timed so that when you walk in the door... When I'm driving, yes.

193
00:20:37,015 --> 00:20:40,116
[SPEAKER_07]: That's how I wake up in the morning is by putting in my Phantom of the Opera soundtrack.

194
00:20:41,806 --> 00:20:43,927
[SPEAKER_25]: That should be somebody's alarm in the morning.

195
00:20:44,227 --> 00:20:49,668
[SPEAKER_25]: Like, can you imagine, you know, you're resting all peacefully and then the sun's coming up and then your CD player kicks in and it's at max volume.

196
00:20:50,108 --> 00:20:52,829
[SPEAKER_25]: Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo.

197
00:20:53,089 --> 00:20:54,129
[SPEAKER_14]: That would be awesome.

198
00:20:54,309 --> 00:20:55,689
[SPEAKER_14]: I should do that to Dan one day.

199
00:20:55,709 --> 00:20:57,110
[SPEAKER_14]: You just have to be where falling chandeliers.

200
00:20:59,110 --> 00:21:01,151
[SPEAKER_25]: Yeah, it's so loud the chandelier falls.

201
00:21:01,231 --> 00:21:01,771
[SPEAKER_25]: Ha, ha, ha.

202
00:21:01,851 --> 00:21:02,111
[SPEAKER_25]: Anyway.

203
00:21:02,991 --> 00:21:04,771
[SPEAKER_07]: In our case, it'd be the halogen lamp falls over.

204
00:21:07,812 --> 00:21:09,152
[SPEAKER_07]: It turns out it was the cat after all.

205
00:21:09,192 --> 00:21:11,373
[SPEAKER_07]: She's, you know, the cat

206
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:12,760
[SPEAKER_05]: Your cat's playing?

207
00:21:13,180 --> 00:21:14,401
[SPEAKER_07]: The cat's the bandit.

208
00:21:14,441 --> 00:21:16,802
[SPEAKER_05]: How do you tune your cats?

209
00:21:17,682 --> 00:21:17,982
[SPEAKER_07]: Kick her.

210
00:21:21,923 --> 00:21:22,304
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

211
00:21:22,324 --> 00:21:25,245
[SPEAKER_07]: That's where I wake up to cat in the face.

212
00:21:25,805 --> 00:21:26,445
[SPEAKER_07]: Meow!

213
00:21:27,365 --> 00:21:28,206
[SPEAKER_07]: Mom, feed me!

214
00:21:28,986 --> 00:21:29,166
Meow!

215
00:21:32,912 --> 00:21:34,113
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

216
00:21:59,993 --> 00:22:04,475
[SPEAKER_25]: Are you pissed off that they never released any new ones on PlayStation?

217
00:22:04,615 --> 00:22:06,576
[SPEAKER_07]: Dan is, but we're looking for the second Append now.

218
00:22:06,916 --> 00:22:07,197
[SPEAKER_25]: Oh, okay.

219
00:22:07,677 --> 00:22:10,578
[SPEAKER_07]: But I finally, finally passed Liar Liar all the way through.

220
00:22:11,439 --> 00:22:11,719
[SPEAKER_07]: Yay.

221
00:22:12,659 --> 00:22:14,100
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not really all that great at Guitar Freaks.

222
00:22:15,201 --> 00:22:18,362
[SPEAKER_07]: But I can pass Carnival Day like it's, you know, nothing.

223
00:22:19,303 --> 00:22:20,663
[SPEAKER_07]: That was one of the bonus tracks from 5th.

224
00:22:22,264 --> 00:22:24,505
[SPEAKER_25]: Why will they not put Guitar Freaks 5?

225
00:22:25,145 --> 00:22:27,326
[SPEAKER_25]: It's Guitar Freaks 5 isn't out for home, right?

226
00:22:28,027 --> 00:22:28,467
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it is.

227
00:22:29,571 --> 00:22:31,593
[SPEAKER_07]: I thought Guitar Freak's fourth... It's the one labeled Guitarra.

228
00:22:33,154 --> 00:22:35,175
[SPEAKER_07]: Guitar Freak's fifth, Germania fourth.

229
00:22:38,618 --> 00:22:40,279
[SPEAKER_25]: I thought that they stopped with fourth third.

230
00:22:40,499 --> 00:22:42,000
[SPEAKER_25]: I think it's fourth third is where they stop.

231
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:43,241
[SPEAKER_25]: I'm sure somebody in the chat... Okay, no, you're right.

232
00:22:43,301 --> 00:22:45,163
[SPEAKER_07]: It's three seconds and then fourth third.

233
00:22:45,183 --> 00:22:45,663
[SPEAKER_25]: Fourth third.

234
00:22:45,743 --> 00:22:48,325
[SPEAKER_25]: And then five, four is the one they really need to do.

235
00:22:48,645 --> 00:22:51,107
[SPEAKER_25]: Like, all of my favorite Guitar Freak songs were on fifth.

236
00:22:51,127 --> 00:22:51,888
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

237
00:22:51,948 --> 00:22:52,628
[SPEAKER_25]: And then six.

238
00:22:52,668 --> 00:22:54,370
[SPEAKER_25]: And there's, you know, there's good ones as the series goes on.

239
00:22:54,390 --> 00:22:57,052
[SPEAKER_07]: It depends on you, though, on the fourth third.

240
00:22:57,172 --> 00:22:57,352
[SPEAKER_07]: Well...

241
00:22:57,754 --> 00:22:59,175
[SPEAKER_07]: and Liar Liar and Dynamite.

242
00:22:59,235 --> 00:23:11,864
[SPEAKER_25]: I'm not saying there's bad songs, but I'm just saying all the songs I want to play, what would make me get a guitar, little controller and all that stuff, because I would never get a drum set at home type thing.

243
00:23:11,904 --> 00:23:16,387
[SPEAKER_25]: It's just, I just, I really suck at Drum Mania and it's not a game I want to get better at.

244
00:23:18,354 --> 00:23:19,895
[SPEAKER_25]: Good for you, but not for me.

245
00:23:19,915 --> 00:23:21,396
[SPEAKER_07]: I got it pretty cheap, too.

246
00:23:21,436 --> 00:23:23,877
[SPEAKER_25]: But Guitar Freaks is kind of fun.

247
00:23:23,917 --> 00:23:26,018
[SPEAKER_25]: What I love about Guitar Freaks is the cheesy side of me.

248
00:23:26,038 --> 00:23:29,560
[SPEAKER_25]: I love how you get bonus points for when you do the little... With the whale.

249
00:23:29,620 --> 00:23:31,461
[SPEAKER_25]: Like, you know, lift the guitar up like you're a rock star.

250
00:23:32,141 --> 00:23:33,062
[SPEAKER_25]: Okay, I'm lame, whatever.

251
00:23:33,322 --> 00:23:35,323
[SPEAKER_07]: I shoot myself in the head like a rock star.

252
00:23:37,084 --> 00:23:41,766
[SPEAKER_07]: But, um... No, uh... What else?

253
00:23:42,167 --> 00:23:42,227
[SPEAKER_07]: Um...

254
00:23:43,812 --> 00:23:46,754
[SPEAKER_07]: mainly, you know, and I did school, doing a project for my art class.

255
00:23:46,814 --> 00:23:51,337
[SPEAKER_07]: It's supposed to be my midterm, so we're starting it now, because we're not going to have a test, we're just going to do a project.

256
00:23:52,278 --> 00:24:12,032
[SPEAKER_07]: And I have to take, I told you about this earlier, but you take a picture from a magazine, you have to redo it as a pencil contour drawing, and then redo it as a ink contour, then do an ink wash version of the picture, Conti crayon, oil pastel, watercolor, um...

257
00:24:15,071 --> 00:24:16,432
[SPEAKER_07]: There's another one that I'm forgetting.

258
00:24:16,532 --> 00:24:18,112
[SPEAKER_07]: Charcoal, which I hate charcoal.

259
00:24:18,913 --> 00:24:21,114
[SPEAKER_25]: So you have to do the same painting over and over.

260
00:24:21,194 --> 00:24:21,394
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

261
00:24:22,134 --> 00:24:24,515
[SPEAKER_07]: And so far, I'm almost done with my charcoal one.

262
00:24:24,835 --> 00:24:26,356
[SPEAKER_07]: My ContiCran one's almost done.

263
00:24:26,416 --> 00:24:32,799
[SPEAKER_07]: That leaves me the ink wash, oil pastel, watercolor, and then the random one.

264
00:24:32,839 --> 00:24:35,120
[SPEAKER_07]: You basically reinvent the picture.

265
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:38,721
[SPEAKER_25]: I am a horrible, horrible artist.

266
00:24:38,781 --> 00:24:39,982
[SPEAKER_25]: I will never take an art class.

267
00:24:40,282 --> 00:24:44,704
[SPEAKER_25]: It's the one thing I was not meant to do ever in my life was take an art class.

268
00:24:47,229 --> 00:24:49,750
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm helping with the other thing that I brought today.

269
00:24:50,210 --> 00:24:56,795
[SPEAKER_07]: The other thing that my house has been taking up with has been Dracula X on the Turbo Duo.

270
00:24:58,256 --> 00:25:02,939
[SPEAKER_07]: And I have, for later on today, brought that.

271
00:25:03,119 --> 00:25:04,379
[SPEAKER_23]: Okay, we'll talk about that later.

272
00:25:04,399 --> 00:25:06,181
[SPEAKER_07]: I've been doing lots of retro gaming in the house.

273
00:25:06,201 --> 00:25:07,541
[SPEAKER_07]: We've been playing Tengen Tetris.

274
00:25:07,922 --> 00:25:08,222
Why?

275
00:25:08,302 --> 00:25:10,764
[SPEAKER_25]: It sucked.

276
00:25:10,824 --> 00:25:11,424
[SPEAKER_25]: It sucked.

277
00:25:11,784 --> 00:25:12,845
[SPEAKER_07]: No, it was awesome.

278
00:25:13,125 --> 00:25:16,367
[SPEAKER_25]: I did not get the big deal with Tank and Tetris.

279
00:25:16,407 --> 00:25:18,769
[SPEAKER_07]: Tank and Tetris has cooperative play.

280
00:25:19,209 --> 00:25:20,390
[SPEAKER_25]: Okay, I'll give you that.

281
00:25:20,490 --> 00:25:22,211
[SPEAKER_25]: It does have the better multiplayer.

282
00:25:22,491 --> 00:25:26,294
[SPEAKER_25]: But the music was better, and the Nintendo and the graphics were better, and it was cutesier.

283
00:25:26,634 --> 00:25:28,075
[SPEAKER_07]: It was Nintendo-fied!

284
00:25:28,475 --> 00:25:31,598
[SPEAKER_07]: Tank and Tetris had cooperative play, which makes it all worth it.

285
00:25:31,678 --> 00:25:34,840
[SPEAKER_25]: But Tank and Tetris, outside of that, was really ghetto.

286
00:25:36,048 --> 00:25:37,049
[SPEAKER_08]: It was still Tink and Tetris.

287
00:25:37,069 --> 00:25:38,911
[SPEAKER_25]: It looked like Commodore 64 Tetris.

288
00:25:39,071 --> 00:25:39,612
[SPEAKER_25]: No, worse.

289
00:25:39,852 --> 00:25:41,574
[SPEAKER_25]: It looked like Atari 800 Tetris.

290
00:25:41,854 --> 00:25:43,256
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, it was made by Atari.

291
00:25:43,796 --> 00:25:46,879
[SPEAKER_25]: Yeah, and it looked like they took a direct port from the Atari 800.

292
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:55,148
[SPEAKER_25]: I mean, it's still cool because it's like, ooh, the game that was banned in a court of law type thing.

293
00:25:55,488 --> 00:25:56,669
[SPEAKER_25]: They can't make this game anymore.

294
00:25:57,370 --> 00:25:58,972
[SPEAKER_25]: For that reason, it's cool, but still...

295
00:25:59,796 --> 00:26:01,958
[SPEAKER_25]: It's not the best Tetris game, in my opinion.

296
00:26:02,439 --> 00:26:04,521
[SPEAKER_25]: The one on Game Boy was really the greatest Tetris game.

297
00:26:04,561 --> 00:26:06,603
[SPEAKER_07]: It's still one of the shining stars of my collection.

298
00:26:08,505 --> 00:26:09,246
[SPEAKER_25]: Understandable.

299
00:26:09,967 --> 00:26:11,768
[SPEAKER_25]: What about your cartridge of Custer's Revenge?

300
00:26:12,449 --> 00:26:14,191
[SPEAKER_07]: We don't have a cartridge of Custer's Revenge.

301
00:26:14,211 --> 00:26:16,153
[SPEAKER_25]: You need one.

302
00:26:16,173 --> 00:26:17,194
[SPEAKER_07]: We've got a ROM of it.

303
00:26:18,215 --> 00:26:19,136
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually, I take that back.

304
00:26:19,616 --> 00:26:21,038
[SPEAKER_07]: We have a ROM chip of it.

305
00:26:22,380 --> 00:26:32,905
[SPEAKER_25]: Okay, the ROM chip is cool, but as far as the ROM on the computer goes, almost everybody that's ever emulated Atari 2600 on their PC, the first thing they go and download is Custer's Revenge.

306
00:26:32,985 --> 00:26:33,686
[SPEAKER_08]: And X-Man.

307
00:26:34,726 --> 00:26:37,027
[SPEAKER_25]: Custer's Revenge, X-Man, and Adventure.

308
00:26:37,808 --> 00:26:38,348
[SPEAKER_25]: Or E.T.

309
00:26:39,568 --> 00:26:39,869
[SPEAKER_07]: E.T.

310
00:26:39,929 --> 00:26:40,429
[SPEAKER_07]: is horrible.

311
00:26:40,469 --> 00:26:41,469
[SPEAKER_07]: I actually own E.T.

312
00:26:41,589 --> 00:26:44,251
[SPEAKER_25]: Because people usually remember Adventure and E.T.

313
00:26:44,291 --> 00:26:45,451
[SPEAKER_25]: for two very different reasons.

314
00:26:46,172 --> 00:26:46,312
[SPEAKER_07]: E.T.

315
00:26:46,372 --> 00:26:47,692
[SPEAKER_07]: is the worst game ever.

316
00:26:48,032 --> 00:26:51,254
[SPEAKER_25]: And Adventure, probably, for most people, the best game ever that they played.

317
00:26:52,074 --> 00:26:53,034
[SPEAKER_25]: or Yars' Revenge.

318
00:26:53,454 --> 00:26:54,295
[SPEAKER_07]: Pac-Man.

319
00:26:55,415 --> 00:26:57,516
[SPEAKER_07]: Pac-Man was the second worst game ever.

320
00:26:58,256 --> 00:27:00,557
[SPEAKER_25]: Isn't that interesting that Yars' Revenge and E.T.

321
00:27:00,617 --> 00:27:01,817
[SPEAKER_25]: had a lot of the same staff?

322
00:27:03,078 --> 00:27:04,958
[SPEAKER_25]: And one's the worst game ever and one's the best game ever?

323
00:27:05,638 --> 00:27:07,899
[SPEAKER_07]: I went to the panel that they did at Classic Gaming Expo.

324
00:27:08,779 --> 00:27:10,240
[SPEAKER_25]: Oh, I should have gone to that.

325
00:27:10,280 --> 00:27:11,920
[SPEAKER_07]: Was that this year or was that last year?

326
00:27:11,940 --> 00:27:13,081
[SPEAKER_07]: That was this past year.

327
00:27:13,201 --> 00:27:18,042
[SPEAKER_07]: Did Battlezone and quite a number of other games.

328
00:27:18,102 --> 00:27:18,562
[SPEAKER_07]: Defender.

329
00:27:19,683 --> 00:27:20,303
[SPEAKER_07]: That was pretty cool.

330
00:27:22,981 --> 00:27:26,344
[SPEAKER_07]: But yesterday I hung out with Iguana Girl.

331
00:27:26,985 --> 00:27:27,626
[SPEAKER_07]: We went shopping.

332
00:27:28,747 --> 00:27:29,147
[SPEAKER_07]: Had dinner.

333
00:27:30,589 --> 00:27:33,411
[SPEAKER_07]: I burned a bunch, I mean, made pictures of a bunch of DVDs.

334
00:27:35,433 --> 00:27:37,796
[SPEAKER_25]: I thought she was going to say she burned a bunch of forest or something.

335
00:27:38,877 --> 00:27:39,778
[SPEAKER_07]: I burned a bunch of people.

336
00:27:41,419 --> 00:27:44,382
[SPEAKER_07]: And played more of the Final Fantasy game.

337
00:27:45,424 --> 00:27:48,366
[SPEAKER_25]: Well, you at the mall, I can imagine you wanting to burn down some people.

338
00:27:48,506 --> 00:27:50,828
[SPEAKER_25]: Did you walk by any girls that were shopping together?

339
00:27:50,848 --> 00:27:51,628
[SPEAKER_25]: Oh, my God.

340
00:27:51,868 --> 00:27:53,389
[SPEAKER_25]: Oh, my God, you're going to look so cute in that.

341
00:27:53,489 --> 00:27:55,551
[SPEAKER_07]: The mall was busy, like Christmas busy.

342
00:27:55,651 --> 00:27:56,491
[SPEAKER_07]: It was insane.

343
00:27:57,312 --> 00:28:00,094
[SPEAKER_05]: It was everyone teaming up for Super Bowl.

344
00:28:01,014 --> 00:28:01,414
[SPEAKER_25]: Damn.

345
00:28:02,055 --> 00:28:03,356
[SPEAKER_07]: More of the S word.

346
00:28:03,476 --> 00:28:04,156
[SPEAKER_25]: Here's what it is.

347
00:28:04,196 --> 00:28:04,857
[SPEAKER_25]: The stupid bowl.

348
00:28:05,377 --> 00:28:06,798
[SPEAKER_25]: Here's what it is.

349
00:28:06,838 --> 00:28:11,401
[SPEAKER_25]: Since the stupid bowl was going on today, and all the women knew they'd have to be in the kitchen today,

350
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:13,000
[SPEAKER_25]: They went to the mall yesterday.

351
00:28:13,361 --> 00:28:14,641
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, you know what?

352
00:28:14,881 --> 00:28:17,282
[SPEAKER_07]: This is, you know, the zeros.

353
00:28:20,203 --> 00:28:20,983
[SPEAKER_25]: I'm just kidding.

354
00:28:21,003 --> 00:28:23,104
[SPEAKER_07]: People better get some, you know, liberation going on.

355
00:28:23,784 --> 00:28:26,005
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe men make their own damn nachos and get their own damn beer.

356
00:28:27,586 --> 00:28:28,646
[SPEAKER_25]: I'm just kidding with you.

357
00:28:30,007 --> 00:28:31,167
[SPEAKER_25]: I like getting y'all riled up.

358
00:28:31,447 --> 00:28:34,708
[SPEAKER_25]: I like burning a fire on ya.

359
00:28:34,768 --> 00:28:35,408
[SPEAKER_07]: Rob.

360
00:28:35,428 --> 00:28:35,669
[SPEAKER_07]: Rob.

361
00:28:36,529 --> 00:28:36,749
[SPEAKER_07]: Rob.

362
00:28:37,149 --> 00:28:37,329
[SPEAKER_25]: Rob.

363
00:28:37,349 --> 00:28:37,529
[SPEAKER_25]: Rob.

364
00:28:37,789 --> 00:28:37,949
[SPEAKER_25]: Rob.

365
00:28:43,052 --> 00:28:43,592
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you done?

366
00:28:44,213 --> 00:28:44,573
[SPEAKER_08]: Rob!

367
00:28:45,353 --> 00:28:45,873
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you done?

368
00:28:45,893 --> 00:28:45,973
[SPEAKER_03]: Rob!

369
00:28:45,993 --> 00:28:46,794
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you done?

370
00:28:47,974 --> 00:28:48,254
[SPEAKER_23]: What?

371
00:28:49,015 --> 00:28:49,255
[SPEAKER_08]: Hi.

372
00:28:49,535 --> 00:28:49,755
[SPEAKER_23]: Hi.

373
00:28:51,316 --> 00:28:51,976
[SPEAKER_05]: You weren't high.

374
00:28:53,036 --> 00:28:53,657
[SPEAKER_23]: You are high.

375
00:28:54,917 --> 00:28:55,297
[SPEAKER_25]: Anything else?

376
00:28:55,357 --> 00:28:56,338
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm high on life.

377
00:28:57,038 --> 00:28:57,578
[SPEAKER_25]: Anything else?

378
00:28:58,038 --> 00:28:58,298
[SPEAKER_07]: No.

379
00:28:58,419 --> 00:28:59,919
[SPEAKER_25]: Let's keep the show going, people!

380
00:29:00,780 --> 00:29:04,041
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, other than stupid cookie woman, but I'm bringing that up during the FU's.

381
00:29:05,296 --> 00:29:06,276
[SPEAKER_23]: Stupid Cookie Woman.

382
00:29:06,456 --> 00:29:08,117
[SPEAKER_07]: Reading about the Stupid Cookie Woman.

383
00:29:08,297 --> 00:29:09,717
[SPEAKER_23]: Alright, I'll have to hear about this later.

384
00:29:09,737 --> 00:29:13,678
[SPEAKER_07]: No, it's about the two girls who baked all the cookies for her neighborhood and then the one woman sued them.

385
00:29:16,539 --> 00:29:16,879
[SPEAKER_23]: Huh.

386
00:29:17,579 --> 00:29:19,520
[SPEAKER_07]: I will be discussing that later.

387
00:29:20,100 --> 00:29:21,680
[SPEAKER_25]: Can we talk about the Stupid Bowl for a minute?

388
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:22,360
[SPEAKER_07]: Sure.

389
00:29:22,660 --> 00:29:23,681
[SPEAKER_08]: I hate it, but go ahead.

390
00:29:25,041 --> 00:29:28,662
[SPEAKER_25]: Well, I'm surprised we have this many people listening tonight with that whole thing going on.

391
00:29:29,002 --> 00:29:31,823
[SPEAKER_25]: But what is your grudge against the Stupid Bowl, Jamie?

392
00:29:33,363 --> 00:29:33,503
[SPEAKER_07]: It's

393
00:29:35,785 --> 00:29:37,586
[SPEAKER_07]: Like a bastardized version of rugby.

394
00:29:39,127 --> 00:29:41,829
[SPEAKER_07]: At least rugby has men getting bloody wearing shorts.

395
00:29:44,510 --> 00:29:45,270
[SPEAKER_07]: Big advantages there.

396
00:29:47,152 --> 00:29:48,092
[SPEAKER_07]: Real football is soccer.

397
00:29:50,073 --> 00:30:00,059
[SPEAKER_07]: And on top of that, it's just another excuse for millions and millions of Americans to sit on their lazy asses, drink beer, and scream obscenities at their TV.

398
00:30:00,179 --> 00:30:01,540
[SPEAKER_07]: How's that different from any other Sunday night?

399
00:30:02,037 --> 00:30:13,146
[SPEAKER_25]: Yeah, I was going to say, instead we encourage you to, we are encouraging our listeners to sit home, drink juice, and sit and listen to obscenities be screamed at them.

400
00:30:15,708 --> 00:30:18,830
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, if I were the one screaming the obscenities at them, that would be worthwhile.

401
00:30:20,251 --> 00:30:20,892
[SPEAKER_05]: What's stopping you?

402
00:30:24,574 --> 00:30:26,056
[SPEAKER_07]: I need a really big megaphone.

403
00:30:43,706 --> 00:30:44,866
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sure his wife would have been happy.

404
00:30:44,887 --> 00:30:51,149
[SPEAKER_25]: Can you imagine Paul McCartney having a wardrobe malfunction where a ball falls out or something?

405
00:30:51,529 --> 00:30:52,730
[SPEAKER_25]: That's disgusting.

406
00:30:52,870 --> 00:30:54,290
[SPEAKER_07]: I seriously doubt it.

407
00:30:54,770 --> 00:30:57,011
[SPEAKER_25]: I would petition the FCC myself.

408
00:30:57,352 --> 00:31:04,114
[SPEAKER_05]: I bet you Saturday Night Live is going to get him next time and he's going to have a wardrobe malfunction like Janet where his shirt rips off or something.

409
00:31:04,534 --> 00:31:05,355
[SPEAKER_05]: That's disgusting.

410
00:31:06,175 --> 00:31:07,055
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki's shirt ripped off?

411
00:31:07,075 --> 00:31:07,235
[SPEAKER_05]: What?

412
00:31:08,316 --> 00:31:08,556
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh-oh.

413
00:31:09,997 --> 00:31:11,057
[SPEAKER_05]: You broke something, you fixed it.

414
00:31:12,538 --> 00:31:13,278
[SPEAKER_25]: My previous...

415
00:31:13,874 --> 00:31:14,734
[SPEAKER_25]: Well, are you done?

416
00:31:15,495 --> 00:31:15,755
[SPEAKER_05]: You done?

417
00:31:16,055 --> 00:31:16,715
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess so.

418
00:31:18,776 --> 00:31:19,436
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, are you done?

419
00:31:20,196 --> 00:31:20,816
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess so.

420
00:31:24,617 --> 00:31:24,977
[SPEAKER_25]: Fine.

421
00:31:25,718 --> 00:31:26,478
[SPEAKER_25]: I guess I'll go then.

422
00:31:27,018 --> 00:31:28,679
[SPEAKER_25]: You're done since you said you're done.

423
00:31:29,819 --> 00:31:30,679
[SPEAKER_07]: I just said I guess so.

424
00:31:30,699 --> 00:31:33,640
[SPEAKER_07]: I didn't say I was done.

425
00:31:33,740 --> 00:31:35,681
[SPEAKER_25]: See, this is my pet peeve about women.

426
00:31:35,701 --> 00:31:37,641
[SPEAKER_25]: They don't fucking come out and say yes or no.

427
00:31:37,821 --> 00:31:39,582
[SPEAKER_25]: They always have to go maybe.

428
00:31:39,782 --> 00:31:40,382
[SPEAKER_07]: Fine.

429
00:31:40,502 --> 00:31:41,342
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm done.

430
00:31:44,855 --> 00:31:45,235
[SPEAKER_25]: Speak!

431
00:31:48,137 --> 00:31:48,477
[SPEAKER_25]: Anyways.

432
00:31:50,038 --> 00:31:52,800
[SPEAKER_25]: I just fixed the monitor because it wasn't working.

433
00:31:52,820 --> 00:32:00,945
[SPEAKER_25]: And my previous assumption of there's two sets of cords going to the screen, and I thought one of them was for the standard composite inputs.

434
00:32:00,985 --> 00:32:05,808
[SPEAKER_25]: You have to set up your story because you can't assume that every... English for the technological illiterate.

435
00:32:05,828 --> 00:32:06,688
[SPEAKER_25]: I was getting there.

436
00:32:06,908 --> 00:32:07,789
[SPEAKER_25]: Alright, alright.

437
00:32:07,809 --> 00:32:08,069
[SPEAKER_25]: Shit.

438
00:32:08,990 --> 00:32:09,490
[SPEAKER_25]: Anyways.

439
00:32:11,538 --> 00:32:15,881
[SPEAKER_25]: It worked exactly like I thought, so when I unplugged something, it worked perfectly.

440
00:32:16,322 --> 00:32:19,344
[SPEAKER_25]: So, now the monitor works, and I'm happy.

441
00:32:19,884 --> 00:32:23,907
[SPEAKER_25]: But because I tried cutting something off of the Dremel tool, I accidentally grounded something up.

442
00:32:24,007 --> 00:32:28,470
[SPEAKER_25]: So anyways, the monitor thing, this is for that computer that I'm building that's inside of an Xbox.

443
00:32:29,110 --> 00:32:34,994
[SPEAKER_25]: The monitor itself is an old PlayStation 1 monitor, LCD thing, that's like 5 inch.

444
00:32:35,735 --> 00:32:38,517
[SPEAKER_25]: And right now we have the Turbo Duo on there, so...

445
00:32:39,349 --> 00:32:41,190
[SPEAKER_25]: Are we going to be able to play Final Fantasy XI on it?

446
00:32:43,792 --> 00:32:48,896
[SPEAKER_25]: You know, to be honest, I could do that, but not on that computer.

447
00:32:48,916 --> 00:32:50,697
[SPEAKER_25]: You're not going to be able to play Final Fantasy XI on that computer.

448
00:32:50,797 --> 00:32:51,037
[SPEAKER_25]: Nope!

449
00:32:51,778 --> 00:32:53,079
[SPEAKER_25]: That computer is way too weak.

450
00:32:55,220 --> 00:32:59,703
[SPEAKER_25]: You can play Final Fantasy on the emulator.

451
00:33:00,264 --> 00:33:00,964
[SPEAKER_25]: Final Fantasy III.

452
00:33:01,845 --> 00:33:02,245
[SPEAKER_25]: Or VI.

453
00:33:02,405 --> 00:33:02,906
[SPEAKER_05]: Hooray.

454
00:33:04,667 --> 00:33:06,248
[SPEAKER_05]: You can play Phantasy Star Online.

455
00:33:09,433 --> 00:33:10,194
[SPEAKER_25]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

456
00:33:29,727 --> 00:33:36,892
[SPEAKER_25]: The rest of the week was me being sick and just playing a lot of Final Fantasy.

457
00:33:36,972 --> 00:33:41,015
[SPEAKER_25]: We went to the buffet yesterday and that was fun because I hadn't been there.

458
00:33:41,836 --> 00:33:44,678
[SPEAKER_25]: And what else?

459
00:33:45,498 --> 00:33:48,140
[SPEAKER_25]: Oh, that's pretty much it.

460
00:33:48,560 --> 00:33:54,104
[SPEAKER_25]: Just people quitting at my work now and that's funny because they're going to be screwed and I don't care.

461
00:33:55,846 --> 00:33:57,607
[SPEAKER_25]: Yeah, it's just that kind of thing.

462
00:33:59,144 --> 00:34:00,065
[SPEAKER_25]: That's all that happened to me.

463
00:34:01,226 --> 00:34:04,189
[SPEAKER_25]: Alrighty, let's hear from DDR Angel.

464
00:34:04,349 --> 00:34:04,889
[SPEAKER_25]: How was your week?

465
00:34:04,929 --> 00:34:05,410
[SPEAKER_25]: How was your day?

466
00:34:06,971 --> 00:34:07,352
[SPEAKER_08]: Not much.

467
00:34:07,432 --> 00:34:11,356
[SPEAKER_08]: Just a lot of school and homework and, you know, the usual stuff.

468
00:34:11,416 --> 00:34:14,659
[SPEAKER_05]: Working and... Running into creepy guys at fries on Tuesday nights?

469
00:34:14,959 --> 00:34:16,240
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, running into you.

470
00:34:17,842 --> 00:34:19,643
[SPEAKER_08]: No, actually it was kind of funny.

471
00:34:19,864 --> 00:34:20,204
[SPEAKER_08]: I, um...

472
00:34:20,842 --> 00:34:31,768
[SPEAKER_08]: went over to Fry's on Tuesday and aside from watching 23rd Magus play DDR again because he always has to stop there for some reason just to show off or whatever.

473
00:34:32,248 --> 00:34:33,168
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, not really show off.

474
00:34:33,769 --> 00:34:34,149
[SPEAKER_08]: Just play.

475
00:34:35,129 --> 00:34:42,233
[SPEAKER_08]: So I was looking for a new speaker set and just some other stuff that I needed and I ran into Bugged!

476
00:34:43,354 --> 00:34:43,714
[SPEAKER_08]: And that was fun.

477
00:34:43,734 --> 00:34:45,395
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, and I recovered perfectly fine, thank you.

478
00:34:46,655 --> 00:34:47,135
[SPEAKER_08]: What did I do?

479
00:34:48,016 --> 00:34:48,916
[SPEAKER_08]: I did nothing!

480
00:34:49,237 --> 00:34:49,957
[SPEAKER_05]: You said you ran into me.

481
00:34:50,359 --> 00:34:51,360
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, I did.

482
00:34:51,420 --> 00:34:52,120
[SPEAKER_08]: No, no, no, no, no.

483
00:34:52,140 --> 00:34:53,622
[SPEAKER_08]: That would be 23rd Magus running into you.

484
00:34:53,662 --> 00:34:54,142
[SPEAKER_08]: Puppy porn?

485
00:34:54,202 --> 00:34:54,422
[SPEAKER_08]: What?

486
00:34:55,843 --> 00:34:56,484
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't want to know.

487
00:34:56,564 --> 00:34:56,904
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

488
00:34:57,665 --> 00:34:58,285
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the puppy bowl.

489
00:34:58,325 --> 00:35:01,228
[SPEAKER_05]: Puppies don't have bowls?

490
00:35:02,268 --> 00:35:02,989
[SPEAKER_08]: Not much other than that.

491
00:35:03,049 --> 00:35:10,975
[SPEAKER_08]: I really wish that I could play Final Fantasy XI this week, but homework kind of got in the way and all that stuff.

492
00:35:11,416 --> 00:35:18,441
[SPEAKER_08]: So this week, hopefully, I will get things done probably tonight or tomorrow, and then I can play with everyone.

493
00:35:18,461 --> 00:35:18,521
[SPEAKER_08]: Yay!

494
00:35:18,862 --> 00:35:19,222
[SPEAKER_08]: Yay!

495
00:35:21,092 --> 00:35:21,652
[SPEAKER_08]: And that'd be it.

496
00:35:22,353 --> 00:35:23,714
[SPEAKER_25]: Be gentle when you play with all of us.

497
00:35:27,456 --> 00:35:27,996
[SPEAKER_25]: How was your week?

498
00:35:28,036 --> 00:35:28,637
[SPEAKER_25]: How was your day?

499
00:35:28,977 --> 00:35:31,238
[SPEAKER_05]: I ran into this creepy person at Fry's on Tuesday night.

500
00:35:34,580 --> 00:35:36,261
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not creepy, I'm angelic.

501
00:35:36,481 --> 00:35:37,302
[SPEAKER_05]: I wasn't talking about you.

502
00:35:37,322 --> 00:35:39,623
[SPEAKER_05]: I was the other creepy one.

503
00:35:39,663 --> 00:35:40,384
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, he's creepy.

504
00:35:41,244 --> 00:35:41,524
He was.

505
00:35:43,225 --> 00:35:45,487
[SPEAKER_05]: He gave me this weird eye like, damn, I know you.

506
00:35:45,947 --> 00:35:47,628
[SPEAKER_05]: I gave him the weird eye like, I do know you.

507
00:35:48,604 --> 00:35:53,768
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I would call it something, but then... Yeah, never mind.

508
00:35:54,688 --> 00:35:56,870
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll just call it the eyebrow.

509
00:36:00,632 --> 00:36:02,674
[SPEAKER_25]: Anyway, other than that, how was your week and your day?

510
00:36:03,314 --> 00:36:06,536
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, ended up in San Jose yesterday for a birthday party.

511
00:36:07,037 --> 00:36:09,078
[SPEAKER_05]: Lots of video games and other various games.

512
00:36:09,338 --> 00:36:10,179
[SPEAKER_25]: Yes, how'd that go?

513
00:36:10,359 --> 00:36:11,460
[SPEAKER_05]: That went pretty well.

514
00:36:12,140 --> 00:36:14,882
[SPEAKER_05]: And, uh, got back at like 2am, beat my brother home.

515
00:36:15,783 --> 00:36:16,583
[SPEAKER_05]: It was working.

516
00:36:16,963 --> 00:36:17,224
[SPEAKER_24]: Uh-huh.

517
00:36:17,664 --> 00:36:17,904
[SPEAKER_05]: Heh heh.

518
00:36:19,007 --> 00:36:22,430
[SPEAKER_05]: He was kind of surprised to see his big brother sitting at the computer in the kitchen when he walked in at 3am.

519
00:36:23,710 --> 00:36:24,211
[SPEAKER_05]: Can't blame him.

520
00:36:24,531 --> 00:36:27,933
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd be surprised too if somebody was sitting at the computer in my kitchen at 3am.

521
00:36:28,994 --> 00:36:30,315
[SPEAKER_05]: And, uh, let's see.

522
00:36:31,275 --> 00:36:32,396
[SPEAKER_05]: Picked up two video games today.

523
00:36:33,857 --> 00:36:42,362
[SPEAKER_05]: The toy liquidator store over at the outlets had buy one get one 50% off, so I got Civ 3 and Douglas Adams Titanic.

524
00:36:43,863 --> 00:36:45,624
[SPEAKER_05]: Two games I've really wanted to play for a long time.

525
00:36:46,565 --> 00:36:48,086
[SPEAKER_05]: Now that I can actually afford them,

526
00:36:48,530 --> 00:36:50,991
[SPEAKER_25]: I'm curious about Civ 3, like, I haven't really played it.

527
00:36:51,912 --> 00:36:53,593
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, well, if you want to give it a test drive.

528
00:36:53,833 --> 00:36:55,193
[SPEAKER_25]: Yeah, I might have to try that out.

529
00:36:56,694 --> 00:37:03,338
[SPEAKER_25]: I heard that Civ 3 was a little more like Civ 1 than Civ 2 was, because Civ 2 was too much for me.

530
00:37:03,498 --> 00:37:06,759
[SPEAKER_25]: Like, I, oh my god, like, it's too complicated.

531
00:37:07,300 --> 00:37:09,821
[SPEAKER_25]: Civ 1's bad enough, but Civ 2 is like, oh my god.

532
00:37:10,181 --> 00:37:14,623
[SPEAKER_25]: But somebody told me that Civ 3 is a little easier, but I hope that's true.

533
00:37:14,923 --> 00:37:15,924
[SPEAKER_05]: Nothing beats Populous, though.

534
00:37:17,190 --> 00:37:21,336
[SPEAKER_25]: Populous was cool because you could drown people by just taking away all the land.

535
00:37:22,578 --> 00:37:25,241
[SPEAKER_25]: If you guys have never played Populous, check it out sometime.

536
00:37:25,642 --> 00:37:27,164
[SPEAKER_25]: Seriously.

537
00:37:27,725 --> 00:37:29,547
[SPEAKER_25]: I owned it on Super Nintendo, okay?

538
00:37:29,567 --> 00:37:31,210
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it was out on the computer as well.

539
00:37:33,653 --> 00:37:35,194
[SPEAKER_25]: It was really a computer game, too.

540
00:37:35,214 --> 00:37:40,075
[SPEAKER_25]: It was one of those games that some genius decided they were going to port from PC to Super Nintendo.

541
00:37:40,435 --> 00:37:43,796
[SPEAKER_25]: Although the game really, really was not designed to be played on the console.

542
00:37:44,196 --> 00:37:45,617
[SPEAKER_25]: But you try it anyway.

543
00:37:46,757 --> 00:37:48,158
[SPEAKER_25]: And that's how it was on Super Nintendo.

544
00:37:48,478 --> 00:37:49,518
[SPEAKER_25]: The game was awesome.

545
00:37:50,678 --> 00:37:52,059
[SPEAKER_25]: Drowning your own people are the best.

546
00:37:52,239 --> 00:37:53,599
[SPEAKER_05]: My week's been pretty damn boring.

547
00:37:54,300 --> 00:37:58,161
[SPEAKER_05]: And Tuesday's going to be a very interesting day with the funeral.

548
00:37:58,861 --> 00:38:02,082
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot of people from the past life have come out of the woodwork.

549
00:38:03,437 --> 00:38:04,177
[SPEAKER_25]: That's tomorrow?

550
00:38:04,818 --> 00:38:05,138
[SPEAKER_05]: Tuesday.

551
00:38:05,258 --> 00:38:05,678
[SPEAKER_23]: Tuesday.

552
00:38:06,358 --> 00:38:07,539
[SPEAKER_23]: I... Well, yeah.

553
00:38:07,859 --> 00:38:08,219
[SPEAKER_05]: You work.

554
00:38:08,399 --> 00:38:09,560
[SPEAKER_23]: I'll talk to... Well, yeah, that.

555
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:10,080
[SPEAKER_23]: There's that.

556
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:13,901
[SPEAKER_23]: And, you know, I just... I don't like funerals.

557
00:38:17,123 --> 00:38:18,883
[SPEAKER_25]: I really, really don't, so... Yeah.

558
00:38:18,903 --> 00:38:19,063
[SPEAKER_25]: Yeah.

559
00:38:20,304 --> 00:38:22,765
[SPEAKER_05]: But other than that, well, it's pretty standard.

560
00:38:23,705 --> 00:38:24,085
[SPEAKER_25]: All right.

561
00:38:25,086 --> 00:38:25,466
[SPEAKER_25]: Fair enough.

562
00:38:26,436 --> 00:38:27,197
[SPEAKER_25]: My week and my day.

563
00:38:27,217 --> 00:38:27,917
[SPEAKER_25]: I guess it's my turn.

564
00:38:28,238 --> 00:38:29,959
[SPEAKER_25]: Okay, I want to expand on the buffet thing.

565
00:38:29,999 --> 00:38:33,321
[SPEAKER_25]: We went to Thunder Valley Casino, which is this little Indian casino.

566
00:38:33,341 --> 00:38:34,062
[SPEAKER_25]: Well, it's not really little.

567
00:38:34,082 --> 00:38:43,388
[SPEAKER_25]: It's this big Indian casino that is somewhere between here, where we are in Sacramento, and Reno, which is where all the gambling used to happen.

568
00:38:43,789 --> 00:38:49,473
[SPEAKER_25]: But now that they have this new Indian casino, that's where everybody in this area goes to gamble, and Reno is practically going bankrupt because of it.

569
00:38:49,853 --> 00:38:51,455
[SPEAKER_25]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

570
00:39:11,253 --> 00:39:16,035
[SPEAKER_25]: Like, I brought back one plate that had like this really good tortellini on it and coconut shrimp.

571
00:39:18,135 --> 00:39:19,756
[SPEAKER_25]: And I think my buddy Christopher put it best.

572
00:39:19,796 --> 00:39:22,537
[SPEAKER_25]: The coconut shrimp tasted like a Krispy Kreme donut.

573
00:39:23,377 --> 00:39:24,277
[SPEAKER_25]: It was so good.

574
00:39:24,957 --> 00:39:25,838
[SPEAKER_25]: And I love coconut shrimp.

575
00:39:25,878 --> 00:39:26,818
[SPEAKER_25]: I had so much coconut yesterday.

576
00:39:26,838 --> 00:39:28,618
[SPEAKER_25]: I had that and I had a coconut cream pie.

577
00:39:29,379 --> 00:39:30,579
[SPEAKER_25]: Sorry, am I making you guys hungry?

578
00:39:30,599 --> 00:39:30,919
[SPEAKER_25]: I'm sorry.

579
00:39:31,339 --> 00:39:32,440
[SPEAKER_25]: I ate so much.

580
00:39:32,540 --> 00:39:33,100
[SPEAKER_25]: I was so full.

581
00:39:33,540 --> 00:39:36,821
[SPEAKER_25]: And then I lost $75 in the casino.

582
00:39:37,581 --> 00:39:37,961
[SPEAKER_25]: Go me.

583
00:39:38,221 --> 00:39:38,561
[SPEAKER_25]: I rock.

584
00:39:39,182 --> 00:39:39,302
[SPEAKER_25]: So...

585
00:39:41,068 --> 00:39:42,949
[SPEAKER_25]: Loki, how long would you say it took me to lose $75?

586
00:39:43,710 --> 00:39:47,032
[SPEAKER_25]: About 10 minutes.

587
00:39:47,312 --> 00:39:52,075
[SPEAKER_25]: Because I play quarters and dollars.

588
00:39:53,716 --> 00:39:55,277
[SPEAKER_25]: I don't stick around for that nickel stuff.

589
00:39:55,317 --> 00:39:56,138
[SPEAKER_25]: That ain't gambling.

590
00:39:57,038 --> 00:39:58,659
[SPEAKER_05]: That's how you don't lose $75.

591
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:01,301
[SPEAKER_05]: Because a buck gets you 20 plays.

592
00:40:05,882 --> 00:40:07,703
[SPEAKER_25]: Oh, well, see, no, no, no.

593
00:40:07,883 --> 00:40:14,464
[SPEAKER_25]: Because on nickel machines, this actually, you know what, we can relate this to Bomani because a lot of those nickel machines are built by Konami.

594
00:40:14,685 --> 00:40:17,445
[SPEAKER_25]: You may not know this, but Konami actually has a lot of these machines as well.

595
00:40:18,166 --> 00:40:22,927
[SPEAKER_25]: And the deal is that a lot of the nickel machines that are out there are actually video slot machines.

596
00:40:23,667 --> 00:40:26,088
[SPEAKER_25]: And the way they're built, they have five reels.

597
00:40:27,088 --> 00:40:30,329
[SPEAKER_25]: And when you put that, you can play them nine different ways.

598
00:40:30,808 --> 00:40:38,733
[SPEAKER_25]: It's like you could play it straight across, you could play it diagonally, bouncing around this way and that way, and making little mountains and valleys.

599
00:40:39,233 --> 00:40:44,216
[SPEAKER_25]: It's crazy, all the different line patterns that you can have when you play on a nickel slot machine.

600
00:40:44,577 --> 00:40:49,540
[SPEAKER_25]: So, if you want to play all nine ways on a nickel slot, you're really spending 50 cents a pull.

601
00:40:51,281 --> 00:40:52,662
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, but you have nine chances to win.

602
00:40:54,603 --> 00:40:58,045
[SPEAKER_25]: But that's crap, because that stuff is programmed to only spit out so much money.

603
00:40:58,385 --> 00:40:59,866
[SPEAKER_25]: I hate playing nickel slots, to be honest.

604
00:41:00,367 --> 00:41:02,528
[SPEAKER_05]: There's actually more than five arrows, so it's better than pump butt.

605
00:41:24,096 --> 00:41:25,036
[SPEAKER_23]: Pretty mellow.

606
00:41:25,557 --> 00:41:26,217
[SPEAKER_23]: I didn't do a lot.

607
00:41:26,257 --> 00:41:27,758
[SPEAKER_23]: I was sick Wednesday.

608
00:41:27,778 --> 00:41:28,578
[SPEAKER_23]: I didn't go to work.

609
00:41:28,678 --> 00:41:30,119
[SPEAKER_23]: And so, you know, that's kind of a bummer.

610
00:41:30,179 --> 00:41:33,861
[SPEAKER_23]: But don't drink on weeknights, kids.

611
00:41:33,981 --> 00:41:34,781
[SPEAKER_23]: This is something I learned.

612
00:41:34,841 --> 00:41:35,762
[SPEAKER_23]: Don't drink on a weeknight.

613
00:41:37,022 --> 00:41:38,023
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't over-drink on a weeknight.

614
00:41:38,043 --> 00:41:39,924
[SPEAKER_25]: Yeah, don't over-drink on a weeknight.

615
00:41:40,064 --> 00:41:41,144
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't do it without a plan.

616
00:41:41,324 --> 00:41:45,386
[SPEAKER_25]: Don't take seven shots of straight-up rum on a weeknight within the scope of an hour.

617
00:41:46,967 --> 00:41:47,267
[SPEAKER_07]: You know?

618
00:41:47,947 --> 00:41:48,208
[SPEAKER_25]: Yes?

619
00:41:49,068 --> 00:41:49,668
[SPEAKER_07]: That would stop me.

620
00:41:50,949 --> 00:41:52,029
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't do that at any time.

621
00:41:52,650 --> 00:41:53,110
[SPEAKER_25]: Seriously?

622
00:41:55,020 --> 00:42:00,621
[SPEAKER_25]: If I ever do that again, I'm checking myself into AA or something, and I'm not into those 12-step programs.

623
00:42:01,042 --> 00:42:02,662
[SPEAKER_25]: I'm a one-step program kind of person.

624
00:42:02,742 --> 00:42:04,803
[SPEAKER_25]: I'm no more drinking on weeknights, period.

625
00:42:04,823 --> 00:42:06,363
[SPEAKER_07]: Step one, remove cap.

626
00:42:06,823 --> 00:42:09,604
[SPEAKER_07]: Step two, take shot glass.

627
00:42:10,244 --> 00:42:11,844
[SPEAKER_04]: That's your 12-step program.

628
00:42:11,864 --> 00:42:12,384
[SPEAKER_07]: Poor liquor.

629
00:42:12,745 --> 00:42:14,085
[SPEAKER_07]: Step four, drink.

630
00:42:14,205 --> 00:42:16,145
[SPEAKER_07]: Step five, fuck the other steps.

631
00:42:19,166 --> 00:42:21,267
[SPEAKER_05]: I have a two-step program over the tracks.

632
00:42:21,727 --> 00:42:22,127
[SPEAKER_05]: Brewery.

633
00:42:24,167 --> 00:42:24,887
[SPEAKER_25]: You live right near him.

634
00:42:25,267 --> 00:42:25,448
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

635
00:42:25,468 --> 00:42:27,228
[SPEAKER_25]: For those that don't know, you live near a brewery.

636
00:42:27,748 --> 00:42:28,969
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't even know that I live near a brewery.

637
00:42:28,989 --> 00:42:31,350
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know how long I tell anyone else.

638
00:42:31,390 --> 00:42:32,650
[SPEAKER_25]: I've got to come out there sometime.

639
00:42:32,690 --> 00:42:34,791
[SPEAKER_25]: It's just weeknight, drive.

640
00:42:34,811 --> 00:42:36,812
[SPEAKER_25]: You can drive with someone.

641
00:42:37,112 --> 00:42:37,752
[SPEAKER_25]: I know, I will.

642
00:42:38,533 --> 00:42:39,013
[SPEAKER_25]: Someday.

643
00:42:40,153 --> 00:42:40,693
[SPEAKER_05]: Take the train.

644
00:42:41,614 --> 00:42:41,934
[SPEAKER_23]: Someday.

645
00:42:43,715 --> 00:42:44,555
[SPEAKER_25]: I guess that's it for now.

646
00:42:44,595 --> 00:42:46,836
[SPEAKER_25]: If I think of something else exciting, I'll tell you guys about it later.

647
00:42:46,876 --> 00:42:48,436
[SPEAKER_25]: But gambling was the highlight of my weekend.

648
00:42:48,476 --> 00:42:48,656
[SPEAKER_25]: What?

649
00:42:52,218 --> 00:42:52,818
[SPEAKER_23]: No, I didn't.

650
00:42:54,682 --> 00:42:56,084
[SPEAKER_23]: I was antisocial this weekend.

651
00:42:56,264 --> 00:42:57,766
[SPEAKER_23]: I was very antisocial this weekend.

652
00:42:58,607 --> 00:43:00,849
[SPEAKER_23]: That was kind of the theme of my whole week, was antisocialness.

653
00:43:01,230 --> 00:43:01,610
[SPEAKER_23]: That's all right.

654
00:43:03,303 --> 00:43:05,224
[SPEAKER_25]: All right, you guys are sick of hearing about us, I'm sure.

655
00:43:05,244 --> 00:43:05,885
[SPEAKER_25]: We're going to come back.

656
00:43:05,905 --> 00:43:06,525
[SPEAKER_25]: We're going to take a break.

657
00:43:06,545 --> 00:43:09,828
[SPEAKER_25]: We're going to come back, and we're going to talk about some Bomani news going on out there right now.

658
00:43:09,868 --> 00:43:17,213
[SPEAKER_25]: We've got some news on 2DX9 style going on, and we've got some news on Ultramix 2, kind of, sort of.

659
00:43:17,974 --> 00:43:23,518
[SPEAKER_25]: Even though the game's already out, we have some more news on Ultramix 2 that's all been developing throughout today, in fact.

660
00:43:23,758 --> 00:43:26,300
[SPEAKER_25]: No, no Song Pack 8 yet, and...

661
00:43:28,706 --> 00:43:30,247
[SPEAKER_25]: All sorts of other stuff that we can come up with.

662
00:43:30,307 --> 00:43:32,749
[SPEAKER_25]: Plus, Jamie has something she wants to share with you guys, too.

663
00:43:33,189 --> 00:43:40,273
[SPEAKER_25]: I'm not really sure how we're going to do this on air, how this is going to translate to radio, but you seem to have something already planned, Jamie, for our listeners.

664
00:43:40,573 --> 00:43:41,033
[SPEAKER_07]: Webcam.

665
00:43:41,534 --> 00:43:42,874
[SPEAKER_25]: And it's a follow-up to last week, right?

666
00:43:42,934 --> 00:43:43,915
[SPEAKER_07]: It is a follow-up to last week.

667
00:43:43,935 --> 00:43:45,116
[SPEAKER_25]: I'm glad you brought up the webcam.

668
00:43:45,316 --> 00:43:46,696
[SPEAKER_25]: www.orangeloungeradio.com

669
00:43:47,877 --> 00:43:48,818
[SPEAKER_25]: And you can see our webcam.

670
00:43:48,878 --> 00:43:50,939
[SPEAKER_25]: Also, don't forget to join our chat room while you're there.

671
00:43:51,399 --> 00:43:53,020
[SPEAKER_25]: And we are a fully interactive program.

672
00:43:53,060 --> 00:43:54,521
[SPEAKER_25]: Check out the Skype line while you're there as well.

673
00:43:54,541 --> 00:43:56,922
[SPEAKER_25]: Click on Interact With Us to find out more information about that.

674
00:43:57,382 --> 00:44:00,924
[SPEAKER_25]: We will open up the Skype line a little later in the show for you guys so you can interact with us.

675
00:44:01,645 --> 00:44:01,985
[SPEAKER_24]: Indeed.

676
00:44:03,046 --> 00:44:06,888
[SPEAKER_25]: Also, when we get back from this break, announcement.

677
00:44:07,668 --> 00:44:14,132
[SPEAKER_25]: Big, huge, Orange Launch Radio announcement that could change the future of everything as we know it.

678
00:44:15,633 --> 00:44:16,413
[SPEAKER_23]: We'll be back after this.

679
00:44:18,908 --> 00:44:20,531
[SPEAKER_25]: Yeah, somebody's going to be fired for good.

680
00:44:20,551 --> 00:44:21,593
[SPEAKER_23]: Donald Trump is swinging by.

681
00:44:21,713 --> 00:44:21,973
[SPEAKER_23]: All right.

682
00:44:22,935 --> 00:44:26,702
[SPEAKER_25]: More 2DX Red music in this break, starting it off with a little bit of Akira Yamaoka.

683
00:44:26,762 --> 00:44:27,303
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you very much.

684
00:44:27,383 --> 00:44:27,804
[SPEAKER_25]: We'll be back.

685
00:46:58,012 --> 00:46:58,633
[SPEAKER_14]: S, Actdeft,

686
00:47:25,225 --> 00:47:27,807
Thank you for watching!

687
00:47:59,637 --> 00:48:00,657
Thank you for watching

688
00:49:09,221 --> 00:49:11,244
Thanks for watching!

689
00:51:10,514 --> 00:51:11,054
and many more.

690
00:52:13,554 --> 00:52:15,375
From the Step Squad to Orange Lab, this PDR sucks!

691
00:52:49,918 --> 00:52:52,740
[SPEAKER_25]: We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio.

692
00:52:52,980 --> 00:52:55,843
[SPEAKER_25]: Hope you enjoyed that break of some 2DX Red music.

693
00:52:56,283 --> 00:52:59,766
[SPEAKER_25]: Now that the OST is out, you can really take a second look at a lot of those songs.

694
00:53:01,928 --> 00:53:07,112
[SPEAKER_25]: It really just shows you how much the quality of an MP3 or the quality of a rip can really affect...

695
00:53:07,672 --> 00:53:09,152
[SPEAKER_25]: The way you perceive a song.

696
00:53:09,232 --> 00:53:13,693
[SPEAKER_25]: For instance, what would be a song... Well, I would say EVO 66 was one of those songs.

697
00:53:14,374 --> 00:53:16,154
[SPEAKER_25]: We played that one a little bit earlier in the show.

698
00:53:16,534 --> 00:53:22,815
[SPEAKER_25]: That was one of those songs that when I heard the soundboard rip or the one from the game, I was just kind of like, oh, that sounds okay.

699
00:53:23,236 --> 00:53:27,396
[SPEAKER_25]: But then when I was listening to the soundtrack on it, I was like, oh, this is kind of groovy.

700
00:53:27,677 --> 00:53:29,677
[SPEAKER_25]: It really kind of thumps a lot more.

701
00:53:29,977 --> 00:53:32,238
[SPEAKER_25]: I guess because you get more of the bass and the fullness of the sound.

702
00:53:32,258 --> 00:53:33,938
[SPEAKER_25]: This is a really thumping song.

703
00:53:34,558 --> 00:53:43,344
[SPEAKER_25]: And considering I live too far away from any 2DX Red machines, so I haven't really gotten to play the actual machine, this is the only way I kind of get to live 2DX Red.

704
00:53:43,684 --> 00:53:45,545
[SPEAKER_05]: Where are they around here?

705
00:53:45,806 --> 00:53:52,090
[SPEAKER_25]: I think there might be one at Sviggle last I heard, but I know Arcade Infinity has one for sure.

706
00:53:54,211 --> 00:53:55,352
[SPEAKER_25]: Oh, you got them both.

707
00:53:56,255 --> 00:53:57,056
[SPEAKER_25]: So you could play them.

708
00:53:58,216 --> 00:54:00,078
[SPEAKER_25]: You want to play one side by side or something?

709
00:54:01,299 --> 00:54:03,020
[SPEAKER_25]: Play EVO 66.

710
00:54:03,140 --> 00:54:04,921
[SPEAKER_25]: Play a little clip of that one.

711
00:54:04,961 --> 00:54:06,082
[SPEAKER_25]: Just jump in the middle of the song.

712
00:54:06,102 --> 00:54:06,643
[SPEAKER_25]: Play a little bit.

713
00:54:07,623 --> 00:54:08,504
[SPEAKER_25]: What's down there at the bottom?

714
00:54:08,584 --> 00:54:08,904
[SPEAKER_25]: Techno.

715
00:54:10,465 --> 00:54:10,785
[SPEAKER_25]: Techno.

716
00:54:10,966 --> 00:54:11,286
[SPEAKER_25]: There it is.

717
00:54:11,886 --> 00:54:12,767
[SPEAKER_25]: Play a little clip of that.

718
00:54:14,388 --> 00:54:16,790
See how it's kind of like...

719
00:54:29,849 --> 00:54:32,850
I don't know.

720
00:54:32,870 --> 00:54:39,532
[SPEAKER_14]: Pause it for a minute.

721
00:54:39,592 --> 00:54:40,913
[SPEAKER_25]: Pause it for a minute.

722
00:54:41,013 --> 00:54:41,453
[SPEAKER_25]: Stop for a minute.

723
00:54:41,473 --> 00:54:43,594
[SPEAKER_25]: Okay, because you just played the soundtrack one side by side.

724
00:54:43,934 --> 00:54:44,154
[SPEAKER_25]: Okay.

725
00:54:44,867 --> 00:54:46,148
[SPEAKER_25]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

726
00:55:11,748 --> 00:55:12,888
[SPEAKER_25]: Sure, it sounds just fine at 112.

727
00:55:13,368 --> 00:55:14,749
[SPEAKER_25]: You can understand everything perfectly.

728
00:55:15,069 --> 00:55:16,909
[SPEAKER_25]: But at 192, it's like, oh my god.

729
00:55:16,929 --> 00:55:18,229
[SPEAKER_25]: It sounds just like the CD.

730
00:55:20,370 --> 00:55:20,630
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway.

731
00:55:23,110 --> 00:55:23,690
[SPEAKER_25]: Let's see.

732
00:55:23,810 --> 00:55:25,090
[SPEAKER_25]: What else was I going to bring up here?

733
00:55:26,291 --> 00:55:28,111
[SPEAKER_25]: Big news for Orange Lounge Radio.

734
00:55:28,711 --> 00:55:30,071
[SPEAKER_25]: I don't want to spill too much.

735
00:55:30,771 --> 00:55:38,133
[SPEAKER_25]: However, sometime before the end of the month, we're officially going to be making some big changes to the station.

736
00:55:38,153 --> 00:55:38,613
[SPEAKER_25]: Big changes.

737
00:55:38,673 --> 00:55:39,993
[SPEAKER_25]: Big changes.

738
00:55:40,492 --> 00:55:40,812
[SPEAKER_07]: Radio Kake?

739
00:55:59,420 --> 00:56:03,141
[SPEAKER_25]: I don't want to say too much more, but we're going to freshen up Orange Lounge a little bit.

740
00:56:03,181 --> 00:56:05,682
[SPEAKER_25]: For those of you that said that Orange Lounge is getting too stale.

741
00:56:05,722 --> 00:56:08,123
[SPEAKER_25]: We're going to freshen things up around here a little bit.

742
00:56:08,623 --> 00:56:10,004
[SPEAKER_25]: FDS?

743
00:56:10,084 --> 00:56:13,785
[SPEAKER_25]: We don't have an official... Yeah, we're going to spray some FDS on our station.

744
00:56:14,725 --> 00:56:15,706
[SPEAKER_25]: Because it needs it.

745
00:56:19,407 --> 00:56:22,688
[SPEAKER_25]: But we'll announce an official date soon.

746
00:56:22,908 --> 00:56:25,689
[SPEAKER_25]: So stay tuned to our website, OrangeLoungeRadio.com for more details.

747
00:56:26,349 --> 00:56:28,010
[SPEAKER_07]: We can just go ahead and tell them that we were...

748
00:56:28,683 --> 00:56:29,824
[SPEAKER_07]: with all the original content removed.

749
00:56:53,504 --> 00:56:58,948
[SPEAKER_25]: Yeah, except all of us will have been fired and, like, you know, maybe the FU segment's still intact.

750
00:56:58,968 --> 00:57:00,048
[SPEAKER_25]: That'll be the one thing they keep.

751
00:57:00,128 --> 00:57:00,549
[SPEAKER_25]: That'll be it.

752
00:57:00,569 --> 00:57:04,351
[SPEAKER_05]: And don't talk about Bomani anymore.

753
00:57:06,132 --> 00:57:06,392
[SPEAKER_25]: Yeah.

754
00:57:07,092 --> 00:57:08,673
[SPEAKER_25]: And we won't ever talk about Bomani anymore.

755
00:57:08,733 --> 00:57:09,894
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll only talk about country music.

756
00:57:10,274 --> 00:57:14,136
[SPEAKER_25]: And all of us will be replaced by busty Asian chicks and American Idol rejects.

757
00:57:14,917 --> 00:57:18,359
[SPEAKER_25]: And, uh... That'll be it.

758
00:57:20,040 --> 00:57:20,941
[SPEAKER_25]: Loki needs a spin-off show.

759
00:57:48,260 --> 00:57:53,682
[SPEAKER_25]: You should put an ad in the paper, try to get some bustiation chicks over here once a week, and just talk.

760
00:57:56,263 --> 00:57:57,983
[SPEAKER_25]: So, how are they doing today?

761
00:58:01,024 --> 00:58:02,365
[SPEAKER_25]: Good, good.

762
00:58:02,945 --> 00:58:03,905
[SPEAKER_25]: That's right, bounce a little bit.

763
00:58:05,065 --> 00:58:05,546
[SPEAKER_25]: Yeah.

764
00:58:07,746 --> 00:58:09,367
[SPEAKER_25]: Today we're going to play some DDR.

765
00:58:09,387 --> 00:58:13,128
[SPEAKER_25]: Yeah, it'll be great radio, Loki, it'll be excellent radio.

766
00:58:15,086 --> 00:58:21,408
[SPEAKER_25]: I know the folks at home can't see her naked writhing around on the DDR pad, but I can guarantee that she's doing it.

767
00:58:22,448 --> 00:58:22,968
[SPEAKER_25]: Yeah.

768
00:58:23,448 --> 00:58:24,328
[SPEAKER_25]: Go for that AAA.

769
00:58:25,148 --> 00:58:25,468
[SPEAKER_25]: Oh yeah.

770
00:58:26,329 --> 00:58:26,709
[SPEAKER_25]: Slower.

771
00:58:27,749 --> 00:58:28,169
[SPEAKER_25]: Slower.

772
00:58:28,189 --> 00:58:33,150
[SPEAKER_05]: This is why radio porn never took off.

773
00:58:33,350 --> 00:58:37,191
[SPEAKER_25]: Yet radio on the phone, or radio on the phone, sex on the phone is still, you know.

774
00:58:37,211 --> 00:58:37,931
[SPEAKER_05]: That's interactive.

775
00:58:38,031 --> 00:58:39,031
[SPEAKER_05]: That's bi-directional.

776
00:58:40,812 --> 00:58:42,192
[SPEAKER_25]: We're an interactive program.

777
00:58:43,001 --> 00:58:49,686
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, Skype sex, Skype phone sex, that would be... Crap, I gotta go patent that now.

778
00:58:50,046 --> 00:58:50,927
[SPEAKER_25]: Alright, moving right along.

779
00:58:52,708 --> 00:58:54,989
[SPEAKER_25]: Let's talk about some stuff going on in the Mimani world.

780
00:58:57,791 --> 00:58:58,832
[SPEAKER_25]: I was gonna point this out.

781
00:58:59,192 --> 00:59:03,956
[SPEAKER_25]: There's an interesting thread going on over on DDR Freak right now, and it has to do with Ultramix 2.

782
00:59:06,397 --> 00:59:09,860
[SPEAKER_25]: And one of the moderators over there, Cutress...

783
00:59:10,948 --> 00:59:11,629
[SPEAKER_25]: DarkSakura, Luke, Carameldansen

784
00:59:41,589 --> 01:00:08,985
[SPEAKER_25]: everything on the site and put in all these different combinations of letters and he noticed that if you put in CRZY underscore TH it actually pulls up a banner and it's not this is on Konami of Hawaii's site it's actually a banner that says Crazy in Love by Beyonce and it's got it's own cute little artsy pattern so what the hell is this song banner doing on Konami of Hawaii's site?

785
01:00:09,085 --> 01:00:09,405
[SPEAKER_25]: don't know

786
01:00:10,546 --> 01:00:14,448
[SPEAKER_05]: Looks like why did Apple have a PowerBook G5 link?

787
01:00:33,482 --> 01:00:37,805
[SPEAKER_25]: Could it be that maybe I just got disconnected from IRC?

788
01:00:37,925 --> 01:00:38,245
[SPEAKER_25]: I don't know.

789
01:00:38,946 --> 01:00:40,287
[SPEAKER_25]: I'll try to get back in there.

790
01:00:40,907 --> 01:00:41,687
[SPEAKER_25]: Are you guys still on IRC?

791
01:00:41,747 --> 01:00:43,309
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, there was a big split.

792
01:00:43,909 --> 01:00:46,331
[SPEAKER_25]: Oh, I got kicked from chat completely, so I'll try to get back in.

793
01:00:46,931 --> 01:00:52,014
[SPEAKER_25]: Could it be that they were songs that were supposed to be there, and now they're not there anymore?

794
01:00:52,935 --> 01:00:53,235
[SPEAKER_25]: Don't know.

795
01:00:53,835 --> 01:00:54,556
[SPEAKER_25]: But they're on the site.

796
01:00:55,177 --> 01:00:55,657
[SPEAKER_25]: In My Dreams by Nomi

797
01:01:18,157 --> 01:01:19,397
[SPEAKER_25]: That's a licensed song, you guys.

798
01:01:19,457 --> 01:01:27,240
[SPEAKER_25]: It's not the same In My Dreams that was in Dance Maniacs, but it's actually a commercial song.

799
01:01:27,840 --> 01:01:28,720
[SPEAKER_25]: And aren't you lucky?

800
01:01:28,780 --> 01:01:30,240
[SPEAKER_25]: I have a little clip of it, actually.

801
01:01:31,481 --> 01:01:32,201
[SPEAKER_25]: If I can find it.

802
01:01:36,922 --> 01:01:37,642
[SPEAKER_25]: I'm looking right now.

803
01:01:37,682 --> 01:01:38,563
[SPEAKER_25]: I know I had it somewhere.

804
01:01:39,783 --> 01:01:41,423
[SPEAKER_25]: Here's a little clip of that song.

805
01:01:41,624 --> 01:01:44,884
[SPEAKER_25]: Because some folks even on the thread were asking, what in the hell is that song?

806
01:01:44,904 --> 01:01:45,345
[SPEAKER_25]: This is it.

807
01:01:45,585 --> 01:01:46,845
[SPEAKER_25]: This is In My Dreams by Nomi.

808
01:02:19,269 --> 01:02:30,251
[SPEAKER_25]: So interesting that banners exist, not just for that song, but for the Crazy in Love, Beyonce, yet neither one appears to have any connection to Ultramix 2.

809
01:02:33,292 --> 01:02:35,572
[SPEAKER_25]: How do you think to do something like that?

810
01:02:35,632 --> 01:02:36,952
[SPEAKER_25]: I gotta hand it to Cutress.

811
01:02:37,032 --> 01:02:45,634
[SPEAKER_25]: I mean, sure, I've heard of scanning directories to see if there's files in there that aren't linked or something like that, but to figure out that

812
01:02:46,388 --> 01:02:47,509
[SPEAKER_25]: Gee, there's a pattern.

813
01:02:47,869 --> 01:02:49,110
[SPEAKER_25]: Maybe there's songs missing.

814
01:02:49,130 --> 01:02:53,433
[SPEAKER_25]: I guess maybe what he was doing is he was trying to look for the banners for Song Pack 8, maybe.

815
01:02:53,733 --> 01:02:56,555
[SPEAKER_25]: I'm thinking maybe that was it, and then stumbled across this instead.

816
01:02:57,055 --> 01:02:58,776
[SPEAKER_25]: I don't know, but hats off to him.

817
01:02:59,997 --> 01:03:00,518
[SPEAKER_25]: Crazy.

818
01:03:02,419 --> 01:03:02,699
[SPEAKER_25]: Anyway.

819
01:03:04,881 --> 01:03:06,922
[SPEAKER_25]: So, more to develop on now.

820
01:03:07,002 --> 01:03:08,243
[SPEAKER_25]: I guess we will see what happens.

821
01:03:08,903 --> 01:03:10,244
[SPEAKER_25]: Are they going to end up in a song pack?

822
01:03:10,284 --> 01:03:10,625
[SPEAKER_25]: Who knows?

823
01:03:13,366 --> 01:03:13,647
[SPEAKER_25]: Alright.

824
01:03:15,208 --> 01:03:15,608
[SPEAKER_25]: Moving on.

825
01:03:17,987 --> 01:03:24,149
[SPEAKER_25]: I also want to talk about something that's going on with Beatmania 2DX Night Style Consumer.

826
01:03:25,510 --> 01:03:27,031
[SPEAKER_25]: That's a big thing that's going on right now.

827
01:03:29,572 --> 01:03:39,816
[SPEAKER_25]: This is interesting, is that Night Style is going to be coming out next month, but there's going to be, get this, seven different ways to buy 2DX for Night Style.

828
01:03:40,336 --> 01:03:43,597
[SPEAKER_25]: Seven different packages that Konami Style is putting out.

829
01:03:45,143 --> 01:03:52,128
[SPEAKER_25]: Nightstyle plus a Benefit CD, a Visual Emotions 2 DVD that you can just buy by itself.

830
01:03:52,808 --> 01:03:56,991
[SPEAKER_25]: Nightstyle plus the CD, plus Visual Emotions 2, plus a poster.

831
01:03:57,552 --> 01:03:58,552
[SPEAKER_25]: That's going to run you about $100.

832
01:03:59,413 --> 01:04:02,975
[SPEAKER_25]: Nightstyle plus a Benefit CD, plus V-Rare 10, plus poster.

833
01:04:03,896 --> 01:04:05,917
[SPEAKER_25]: And then just all these combinations.

834
01:04:05,977 --> 01:04:12,562
[SPEAKER_25]: There's Visual Emotions 2, poster, V-Rare 10, and then all these goodies together.

835
01:04:13,371 --> 01:04:15,733
[SPEAKER_25]: My gosh, there's a gazillion different ways you can buy this.

836
01:04:15,793 --> 01:04:17,274
[SPEAKER_25]: It almost sounds like something Nintendo would do.

837
01:04:17,955 --> 01:04:19,116
[SPEAKER_25]: There's the one at the bottom there.

838
01:04:19,196 --> 01:04:26,502
[SPEAKER_25]: Nightstyle, Benefit CD, VRare 10, member of B4U, and a poster.

839
01:04:26,882 --> 01:04:27,763
[SPEAKER_25]: And that's going to run you about $200.

840
01:04:30,005 --> 01:04:36,810
[SPEAKER_25]: Yes, you could actually buy yourself a member of B4U.

841
01:04:37,091 --> 01:04:37,611
[SPEAKER_25]: That's lovely.

842
01:04:38,152 --> 01:04:38,692
[SPEAKER_08]: To torture?

843
01:04:38,992 --> 01:04:42,095
[SPEAKER_25]: It sounds like something that... Yes, there's a keychain.

844
01:04:47,665 --> 01:04:52,409
[SPEAKER_25]: Translation that was posted to the live journal community, BM underscore 2DX.

845
01:04:52,449 --> 01:04:53,170
[SPEAKER_25]: This is very nice.

846
01:04:53,710 --> 01:05:00,076
[SPEAKER_25]: Beatmania 2DX, it seems, in order to put out, it is the portable strap which finishes the whole... Remember, this is English here.

847
01:05:00,376 --> 01:05:05,481
[SPEAKER_25]: With the metal material and the good set which designs the various designs of 2DX as the sticker.

848
01:05:06,181 --> 01:05:09,306
[SPEAKER_25]: The metal portable strap, the mark of 2DX stamped in the metal plate.

849
01:05:09,626 --> 01:05:14,393
[SPEAKER_25]: In addition, the yearning AAA mark of the user is stamped on plate back.

850
01:05:14,794 --> 01:05:18,580
[SPEAKER_25]: So in other words, they're going to have this kind of AAA keychain, it sounds like.

851
01:05:19,187 --> 01:05:22,831
[SPEAKER_25]: Some of the songs that are going to be on Visual Emotions, too.

852
01:05:22,871 --> 01:05:23,952
[SPEAKER_25]: Some of the videos that are going to be on it.

853
01:05:24,093 --> 01:05:28,658
[SPEAKER_25]: Doll, Lucy, Space Fight, Quasar.

854
01:05:29,018 --> 01:05:30,280
[SPEAKER_25]: So a lot of the newer songs.

855
01:05:30,300 --> 01:05:32,302
[SPEAKER_25]: But then it kind of goes back to some of the old ones, too.

856
01:05:32,362 --> 01:05:36,527
[SPEAKER_25]: Summer Vacation, 2DX, the song from, what, Fizz Style?

857
01:05:37,407 --> 01:05:39,550
[SPEAKER_25]: Burn in the Floor, Leading Cyber.

858
01:05:41,311 --> 01:05:46,093
[SPEAKER_25]: Doesn't this sound like something Nintendo would do, repackaging the same thing seven different ways?

859
01:05:46,133 --> 01:05:50,594
[SPEAKER_25]: It's like, you should buy seven Game Boy Advances so you can have them all in different colors.

860
01:05:50,654 --> 01:05:51,474
[SPEAKER_25]: Wouldn't that be fabulous?

861
01:05:52,975 --> 01:05:54,055
[SPEAKER_05]: How many iMac colors are there?

862
01:05:54,175 --> 01:05:54,795
[SPEAKER_25]: Yeah, exactly.

863
01:05:54,875 --> 01:05:55,616
[SPEAKER_25]: It's like an iMac.

864
01:05:57,096 --> 01:05:58,997
[SPEAKER_25]: Jamie, you're going to get Night Style, right?

865
01:05:59,897 --> 01:06:00,457
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm debating.

866
01:06:00,497 --> 01:06:02,858
[SPEAKER_25]: Are you going to go for one of these frilly combinations if you do it?

867
01:06:03,778 --> 01:06:04,318
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm debating.

868
01:06:04,858 --> 01:06:05,699
[SPEAKER_07]: Probably just going to get the game.

869
01:06:05,999 --> 01:06:06,599
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe it'll be rare.

870
01:06:06,699 --> 01:06:08,740
[SPEAKER_25]: Are you going to do the one where you can buy a member of B4U?

871
01:06:09,200 --> 01:06:09,780
[SPEAKER_07]: No, that's okay.

872
01:06:11,066 --> 01:06:16,469
[SPEAKER_07]: Not unless I get to, you know, abuse and, you know, maybe draw on her with a Sharpie or something.

873
01:06:40,922 --> 01:06:43,924
[SPEAKER_25]: You know, like, I don't really care about the Visual Emotions CD or whatever it is.

874
01:06:44,424 --> 01:06:49,327
[SPEAKER_25]: You know, the Benefits CD might be cool, because it might be, I think it might be the live performance or whatever they did.

875
01:06:49,367 --> 01:06:54,570
[SPEAKER_25]: You know how they do those, you know, invitation-only concerts and crap.

876
01:06:54,830 --> 01:06:56,751
[SPEAKER_25]: I think that's probably what it is, the second one of those.

877
01:06:56,871 --> 01:06:59,252
[SPEAKER_25]: But, yeah, it'd be rare.

878
01:06:59,492 --> 01:07:02,074
[SPEAKER_25]: Just like the audio CDs there, you know, coming with that.

879
01:07:02,114 --> 01:07:06,597
[SPEAKER_25]: And of course, you know, the consumer tracks that will be on 2DX9, so that'll be cool.

880
01:07:09,078 --> 01:07:09,198
[SPEAKER_25]: Hmm.

881
01:07:11,844 --> 01:07:12,705
[SPEAKER_25]: This is interesting.

882
01:07:14,066 --> 01:07:17,449
[SPEAKER_25]: This just in, and it goes back to the topic we were talking about previously.

883
01:07:17,749 --> 01:07:18,810
[SPEAKER_25]: Literally, just in.

884
01:07:19,670 --> 01:07:21,031
[SPEAKER_25]: El Mullet posted this in chat.

885
01:07:21,051 --> 01:07:26,636
[SPEAKER_25]: It says, use the letters S-C-A-N in that whole Konami of Hawaii site thing with the hidden banners.

886
01:07:26,956 --> 01:07:31,980
[SPEAKER_25]: If you use scan, S-C-A-N, as the letters, mystique, scandalous.

887
01:07:32,681 --> 01:07:34,382
[SPEAKER_25]: That's a song I've heard at the club a few times.

888
01:07:34,422 --> 01:07:36,043
[SPEAKER_25]: That's definitely a big licensed song.

889
01:07:36,083 --> 01:07:36,784
[SPEAKER_25]: I know that song.

890
01:07:36,924 --> 01:07:38,245
[SPEAKER_25]: Very interesting.

891
01:07:38,285 --> 01:07:39,086
[SPEAKER_25]: Very interesting.

892
01:07:40,186 --> 01:07:42,747
[SPEAKER_25]: All hidden away on Konami of Hawaii's site for some reason.

893
01:07:44,268 --> 01:07:44,748
[SPEAKER_24]: Who knows?

894
01:07:45,669 --> 01:07:54,012
[SPEAKER_25]: And of course, Jason in our chat room, our resident, one of our many internet geeks we have to listen to this show, is kind of, is talking about what?

895
01:07:55,933 --> 01:07:57,854
[SPEAKER_07]: He found the banner for A. I was just randomly typing in letters.

896
01:07:57,914 --> 01:08:01,216
[SPEAKER_07]: I did A, A, A, A, and I found A. Well, we all know that A's in the game already.

897
01:08:01,236 --> 01:08:02,976
[SPEAKER_07]: I know, but I mean, I was just randomly typing in letters.

898
01:08:03,076 --> 01:08:04,237
[SPEAKER_25]: Yeah, yeah, it works.

899
01:08:05,594 --> 01:08:11,116
[SPEAKER_25]: But he says that if you think about it, every DDR version, you remember the master song list?

900
01:08:11,237 --> 01:08:13,138
[SPEAKER_25]: Loki's talked about this on the show before in the past.

901
01:08:13,158 --> 01:08:15,359
[SPEAKER_25]: If you haven't listened to the show in a while, you probably never heard this.

902
01:08:15,399 --> 01:08:22,563
[SPEAKER_25]: But basically, every DDR song has this four-letter code and some kind of master list of songs that's out there.

903
01:08:23,263 --> 01:08:32,608
[SPEAKER_25]: And is there a connection between that list and the fact that the way these files were named, the songs happen to have a four-letter link to them?

904
01:08:33,280 --> 01:08:37,703
[SPEAKER_25]: So maybe they were kind of, who knows, linking that all together.

905
01:08:39,524 --> 01:08:40,525
[SPEAKER_25]: Very interesting.

906
01:08:43,587 --> 01:08:44,768
[SPEAKER_25]: Very, very, very interesting.

907
01:08:46,449 --> 01:08:47,650
[SPEAKER_25]: Oh my gosh, look at this.

908
01:08:48,010 --> 01:08:48,510
[SPEAKER_25]: What are they doing?

909
01:08:48,931 --> 01:08:50,332
[SPEAKER_25]: Somebody must be running it right now.

910
01:08:50,432 --> 01:08:55,996
[SPEAKER_25]: El Mullet just said, use the letters P-A-R-T and you get this song.

911
01:08:56,336 --> 01:08:58,237
[SPEAKER_25]: Pink, get the party started.

912
01:08:58,998 --> 01:09:01,359
[SPEAKER_25]: You guys know Pink, right?

913
01:09:01,419 --> 01:09:02,340
[SPEAKER_25]: Wasn't that a Pump song?

914
01:09:03,437 --> 01:09:04,618
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, there's a bump song.

915
01:09:06,119 --> 01:09:06,520
[SPEAKER_25]: Weird.

916
01:09:07,381 --> 01:09:08,061
[SPEAKER_25]: Weird stuff.

917
01:09:10,883 --> 01:09:11,784
[SPEAKER_25]: You're already here first.

918
01:09:12,685 --> 01:09:18,610
[SPEAKER_25]: For some reason, Pink, Beyonce, Mystique, they're all lurking on Konami of Hawaii's site.

919
01:09:18,910 --> 01:09:21,212
[SPEAKER_25]: Is there a big song pack planned for the future?

920
01:09:22,012 --> 01:09:22,473
[SPEAKER_24]: Who knows?

921
01:09:22,773 --> 01:09:23,133
[SPEAKER_25]: Who knows?

922
01:09:24,755 --> 01:09:25,215
[SPEAKER_25]: Interesting.

923
01:09:27,857 --> 01:09:29,238
[SPEAKER_25]: Let's see, where to go to now?

924
01:09:30,399 --> 01:09:31,100
[SPEAKER_25]: I think we'll take a break.

925
01:09:31,829 --> 01:09:32,069
[SPEAKER_25]: GIGADELIC

926
01:09:59,588 --> 01:10:00,129
[SPEAKER_25]: Gigadelic?

927
01:10:00,509 --> 01:10:01,130
[SPEAKER_25]: Like a gigabyte?

928
01:10:01,170 --> 01:10:01,711
[SPEAKER_25]: Gigadelic.

929
01:10:01,811 --> 01:10:02,572
[SPEAKER_25]: We'll be back after this.

930
01:12:39,344 --> 01:12:40,165
Thank you for watching!

931
01:14:30,911 --> 01:14:33,212
DarkSakura, DarkSakura

932
01:16:41,386 --> 01:16:47,668
[SPEAKER_24]: Orange Lounge Radio we put your thing down flip it and reverse it we are back here on Orange Lounge Radio

933
01:16:57,020 --> 01:16:57,880
[SPEAKER_25]: You should see our chatroom.

934
01:16:57,900 --> 01:17:03,062
[SPEAKER_25]: They're going crazy trying to come up with all these four-letter combinations now to try and figure out what else they can find on the site.

935
01:17:03,542 --> 01:17:09,363
[SPEAKER_25]: Even though, apparently, there's a script that's running, I think it was running for a while and then it stopped.

936
01:17:09,423 --> 01:17:12,724
[SPEAKER_25]: Cutter's made a post about he had to stop it and he's thinking about starting it again.

937
01:17:13,024 --> 01:17:17,446
[SPEAKER_25]: That's not stopping people in our chatroom from going and trying to figure out all the four-letter combinations.

938
01:17:17,806 --> 01:17:21,407
[SPEAKER_25]: Now somebody's trying to dig up a master list so they can go through all the four letters.

939
01:17:22,387 --> 01:17:23,387
[SPEAKER_08]: I wouldn't know anything about that.

940
01:17:23,407 --> 01:17:25,768
[SPEAKER_25]: God damn, you people got time on your hands.

941
01:17:26,149 --> 01:17:26,850
[SPEAKER_25]: It's beautiful.

942
01:17:28,491 --> 01:17:31,113
[SPEAKER_25]: It's crazy how obsessed people are with DDR.

943
01:17:31,233 --> 01:17:36,157
[SPEAKER_25]: Maybe not necessarily obsessed with DDR, but just... Pointing the finger?

944
01:17:36,177 --> 01:17:37,459
[SPEAKER_25]: Yeah, solving the mystery.

945
01:17:37,819 --> 01:17:39,660
[SPEAKER_25]: There's a little bit of a thrill of it, I think.

946
01:17:39,700 --> 01:17:40,241
[SPEAKER_25]: It's kind of neat.

947
01:17:40,641 --> 01:17:40,861
[SPEAKER_25]: Matt?

948
01:17:41,602 --> 01:17:41,962
[SPEAKER_25]: Or Loki?

949
01:17:43,644 --> 01:17:51,811
[SPEAKER_25]: I was going to say that there were a few four-letter codes I think I had posted on our site a long-ass time ago, but if you look in the news archives, you probably can find it.

950
01:17:53,152 --> 01:17:54,653
[SPEAKER_25]: So, anyways.

951
01:17:57,361 --> 01:17:57,941
[SPEAKER_23]: Very interesting.

952
01:17:59,182 --> 01:18:02,183
[SPEAKER_25]: Yeah, I think if you do a news archive search, there is a master list somewhere.

953
01:18:03,803 --> 01:18:04,504
[SPEAKER_07]: They were numeric.

954
01:18:07,505 --> 01:18:08,345
[SPEAKER_25]: Yeah.

955
01:18:08,585 --> 01:18:09,125
[SPEAKER_07]: And they didn't work.

956
01:18:10,466 --> 01:18:12,567
[SPEAKER_07]: The numeric codes don't work.

957
01:18:13,547 --> 01:18:14,047
[SPEAKER_25]: Oh, they don't.

958
01:18:14,948 --> 01:18:15,388
[SPEAKER_25]: Interesting.

959
01:18:16,148 --> 01:18:18,109
[SPEAKER_07]: I tried about six or seven of them.

960
01:18:18,789 --> 01:18:25,712
[SPEAKER_25]: Well, some folks are going crazy and trying to find something out.

961
01:18:26,032 --> 01:18:26,632
[SPEAKER_25]: Good luck, you guys.

962
01:18:28,502 --> 01:18:31,785
[SPEAKER_25]: And if you find out more, tell us so we can spoil the news on air for everybody.

963
01:18:32,766 --> 01:18:34,267
[SPEAKER_25]: What news it is, we don't know.

964
01:18:34,427 --> 01:18:38,911
[SPEAKER_25]: Just, you know, hey, this song banner's sitting here in a directory not being used for anything.

965
01:18:39,592 --> 01:18:43,776
[SPEAKER_25]: Probably don't mean shit, but... Boy, isn't it funny what Konami keeps on their site?

966
01:18:44,116 --> 01:18:46,418
[SPEAKER_25]: I wonder what other kind of goodies Konami has on their site.

967
01:18:46,918 --> 01:18:50,442
[SPEAKER_25]: Maybe they've got, like, top secret documents and stuff all hidden on their website.

968
01:18:50,502 --> 01:18:50,782
[SPEAKER_25]: Who knows?

969
01:18:52,415 --> 01:18:55,178
[SPEAKER_25]: Anyway, we're going to open up the Skype line for those of you guys who want to give us a call.

970
01:18:55,258 --> 01:19:03,567
[SPEAKER_25]: Just go to www.OrangeLoungeRadio.com, click on Interact With Us, and you can read all about how you, yes, you, the listener, can call us.

971
01:19:04,167 --> 01:19:11,235
[SPEAKER_25]: We're ghetto, you see, and we can't afford an 800 number, really, so we have you call us using this fancy little internet program.

972
01:19:12,196 --> 01:19:13,017
[SPEAKER_25]: So, do that.

973
01:19:13,712 --> 01:19:14,252
[SPEAKER_25]: Legend of Zaku

974
01:19:34,965 --> 01:19:35,605
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me see.

975
01:19:35,665 --> 01:19:41,328
[SPEAKER_01]: He's trying to figure out any other banners that I can actually guess.

976
01:19:41,768 --> 01:19:46,610
[SPEAKER_25]: It's just not a Skype line segment if Zaku doesn't hammer the lines and get in first, man.

977
01:19:46,670 --> 01:19:47,470
[SPEAKER_25]: It's crazy.

978
01:19:47,990 --> 01:19:48,931
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just luck, man.

979
01:19:48,971 --> 01:19:50,071
[SPEAKER_01]: I just managed to hit it first.

980
01:19:50,171 --> 01:19:50,831
[SPEAKER_25]: Apparently, yeah.

981
01:19:50,871 --> 01:19:53,833
[SPEAKER_25]: Now there's a bunch of people trying to get in right now, but you got in there first.

982
01:19:53,913 --> 01:19:54,313
[SPEAKER_25]: Lucky you.

983
01:19:56,494 --> 01:19:57,674
[SPEAKER_25]: Why, is my question.

984
01:19:57,754 --> 01:20:02,596
[SPEAKER_25]: Why are you hammering the site trying to find all these different letter combinations?

985
01:20:03,243 --> 01:20:03,784
[SPEAKER_01]: Think about it.

986
01:20:03,904 --> 01:20:07,068
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, if you find it, then you'll probably be the first one to know.

987
01:20:07,909 --> 01:20:11,153
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, and then you'll be tempted to just, you know, spread the news.

988
01:20:11,673 --> 01:20:17,600
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, you know, if it gets to that point where Konami finds out what we're actually doing, then it might be a problem.

989
01:20:18,001 --> 01:20:18,161
[SPEAKER_01]: But...

990
01:20:20,487 --> 01:20:22,409
[SPEAKER_25]: What exactly are you finding out?

991
01:20:22,529 --> 01:20:23,790
[SPEAKER_25]: That's the problem.

992
01:20:23,830 --> 01:20:25,671
[SPEAKER_25]: We have no idea what we're finding out.

993
01:20:25,691 --> 01:20:27,713
[SPEAKER_01]: No, we're just finding out banners.

994
01:20:28,393 --> 01:20:33,697
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, possibly we could find out whatever might be on the next songpacks.

995
01:20:33,898 --> 01:20:35,619
[SPEAKER_01]: It could also just be somebody fucking with us.

996
01:20:35,859 --> 01:20:37,320
[SPEAKER_25]: It could be somebody fucking with us.

997
01:20:37,360 --> 01:20:38,601
[SPEAKER_25]: That could be it, completely.

998
01:20:38,681 --> 01:20:39,902
[SPEAKER_25]: Somebody's just fucking with you.

999
01:20:39,922 --> 01:20:40,983
[SPEAKER_25]: That could be true.

1000
01:20:41,524 --> 01:20:46,147
[SPEAKER_25]: You know, Cutris is a great guy, but he's a mod on DDR Freak.

1001
01:20:46,187 --> 01:20:49,350
[SPEAKER_25]: What a perfect person to be in cahoots with Konami, right?

1002
01:20:49,430 --> 01:20:49,610
[SPEAKER_25]: Yes.

1003
01:20:50,560 --> 01:20:51,161
[SPEAKER_25]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1004
01:21:05,618 --> 01:21:06,359
[SPEAKER_01]: It's real simple.

1005
01:21:07,259 --> 01:21:17,487
[SPEAKER_01]: We already know that some of the good licenses we managed to figure out and I'm surprised at how far Konami is going and we don't even know to what extent they are going to.

1006
01:21:18,849 --> 01:21:19,349
[SPEAKER_25]: Yeah, you're right.

1007
01:21:19,389 --> 01:21:19,829
[SPEAKER_25]: We don't know.

1008
01:21:20,710 --> 01:21:25,354
[SPEAKER_25]: The access for who's trying to or what files are trying to be loaded and all that stuff?

1009
01:21:25,454 --> 01:21:25,734
[SPEAKER_25]: I mean the

1010
01:21:27,196 --> 01:21:33,921
[SPEAKER_01]: No, the fact that we managed to uncover certain licenses that we thought Konami would never imagine getting.

1011
01:21:34,082 --> 01:21:40,867
[SPEAKER_25]: Well, as far as I know, though, the webmaster of the Konami site there reads the DDR Freak thread.

1012
01:21:41,207 --> 01:21:45,351
[SPEAKER_25]: She's going to wake up Monday morning and see this and meow.

1013
01:21:45,371 --> 01:21:46,271
[SPEAKER_25]: Rename the files?

1014
01:21:46,612 --> 01:21:49,174
[SPEAKER_25]: Well, probably the files are going to be gone at some point tomorrow.

1015
01:21:49,474 --> 01:21:54,558
[SPEAKER_25]: The question is, if the files are deleted...

1016
01:21:55,268 --> 01:21:57,949
[SPEAKER_25]: Then we know we found something we weren't supposed to find.

1017
01:21:58,909 --> 01:21:59,569
[SPEAKER_25]: But what?

1018
01:22:00,190 --> 01:22:02,550
[SPEAKER_25]: What cat and what bag was just let out?

1019
01:22:03,191 --> 01:22:03,651
[SPEAKER_25]: We don't know.

1020
01:22:04,431 --> 01:22:05,811
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think they have anything on us.

1021
01:22:06,292 --> 01:22:07,592
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, they have nothing on us.

1022
01:22:07,652 --> 01:22:09,793
[SPEAKER_01]: We just managed to find it because of dumb luck.

1023
01:22:10,313 --> 01:22:10,873
[SPEAKER_25]: Either way.

1024
01:22:11,713 --> 01:22:12,594
[SPEAKER_25]: Either way.

1025
01:22:13,454 --> 01:22:23,057
[SPEAKER_25]: Even if these songs... Even if this whole thing was just set up to fuck with us and these songs never see the light of day, you bet... It's a Groundhog's Day thing.

1026
01:22:23,659 --> 01:22:24,279
[SPEAKER_25]: That's true.

1027
01:22:24,339 --> 01:22:24,819
[SPEAKER_25]: I don't know.

1028
01:22:24,879 --> 01:22:25,279
[SPEAKER_25]: It depends.

1029
01:22:25,319 --> 01:22:28,260
[SPEAKER_25]: I mean, it could go either way.

1030
01:22:28,280 --> 01:22:32,581
[SPEAKER_25]: We're just basically taking stabs in the dark right now and we're hitting something.

1031
01:22:50,891 --> 01:22:52,532
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's a nice way to sum it up.

1032
01:22:52,592 --> 01:23:01,436
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, Konami, I can only thank Konami for basically trying at least to get some decent licenses compared to the ones that they did for Europe.

1033
01:23:02,517 --> 01:23:07,539
[SPEAKER_25]: Beyonce, Beyonce, that's huge.

1034
01:23:08,179 --> 01:23:08,940
[SPEAKER_25]: That is huge.

1035
01:23:09,120 --> 01:23:11,581
[SPEAKER_25]: Crazy in Love by Beyonce, that is huge.

1036
01:23:12,361 --> 01:23:15,263
[SPEAKER_25]: If that is going to be in one of the downloadable songpacks...

1037
01:23:17,142 --> 01:23:21,205
[SPEAKER_25]: If that is going to be in one of the downloadable song packs, that is freaking huge.

1038
01:23:21,325 --> 01:23:26,528
[SPEAKER_25]: And the first question people are going to ask probably will be, why the hell wasn't this in the game to start with?

1039
01:23:26,708 --> 01:23:28,209
[SPEAKER_25]: But we don't know.

1040
01:23:28,530 --> 01:23:29,250
[SPEAKER_25]: We don't know any of this.

1041
01:23:29,730 --> 01:23:30,911
[SPEAKER_25]: Will our questions ever be answered?

1042
01:23:30,931 --> 01:23:31,171
[SPEAKER_01]: Probably not.

1043
01:23:31,191 --> 01:23:32,172
[SPEAKER_01]: That's another good question.

1044
01:23:33,601 --> 01:23:36,922
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'll judge that song once I see the steps.

1045
01:23:37,022 --> 01:23:38,362
[SPEAKER_25]: Well, yeah, it always comes down to that.

1046
01:23:38,382 --> 01:23:47,124
[SPEAKER_01]: If they're like eight, like most of the new songs, like eight to nine, like most of the new songs are, then, you know, then I'll make my decision.

1047
01:23:47,544 --> 01:23:47,804
[SPEAKER_25]: All right.

1048
01:23:47,824 --> 01:23:49,584
[SPEAKER_01]: Until then, we can only just speculate.

1049
01:23:50,064 --> 01:23:50,484
[SPEAKER_25]: Sounds good.

1050
01:23:50,524 --> 01:23:51,885
[SPEAKER_25]: Anything else you want to share with us, Zaku?

1051
01:23:51,925 --> 01:23:52,505
[SPEAKER_01]: That's about it.

1052
01:23:52,665 --> 01:23:52,885
[SPEAKER_25]: All right.

1053
01:23:53,305 --> 01:23:55,145
[SPEAKER_25]: I got other people trying to get in, so I'm going to have to let you go.

1054
01:23:56,446 --> 01:23:57,906
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, bye.

1055
01:23:59,206 --> 01:23:59,486
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

1056
01:23:59,566 --> 01:24:00,066
[SPEAKER_25]: Bye, Zaku.

1057
01:24:00,086 --> 01:24:00,466
[SPEAKER_25]: Have a good one.

1058
01:24:01,247 --> 01:24:01,487
[SPEAKER_25]: Later.

1059
01:24:03,067 --> 01:24:03,287
[SPEAKER_24]: Huh.

1060
01:24:04,611 --> 01:24:07,812
[SPEAKER_25]: You know, somebody in the chat room just pointed out something very interesting.

1061
01:24:08,072 --> 01:24:09,753
[SPEAKER_25]: The chat room just died.

1062
01:24:10,413 --> 01:24:11,413
[SPEAKER_25]: I know what you're doing.

1063
01:24:12,654 --> 01:24:14,534
[SPEAKER_25]: You're all trying to hammer that site right now.

1064
01:24:14,594 --> 01:24:15,235
[SPEAKER_25]: Okay, maybe not.

1065
01:24:15,275 --> 01:24:21,197
[SPEAKER_25]: Maybe some of you guys had to go watch the last part of this stupid bowl and see what the Patriots won.

1066
01:24:21,357 --> 01:24:22,077
[SPEAKER_25]: Who are the Patriots?

1067
01:24:22,417 --> 01:24:22,837
[SPEAKER_25]: Who are they?

1068
01:24:22,857 --> 01:24:24,298
[SPEAKER_25]: New England.

1069
01:24:24,338 --> 01:24:24,538
[SPEAKER_25]: What?

1070
01:24:24,838 --> 01:24:25,298
[SPEAKER_12]: New England.

1071
01:24:25,478 --> 01:24:26,018
[SPEAKER_25]: Oh, New England.

1072
01:24:26,098 --> 01:24:26,679
[SPEAKER_12]: Some team.

1073
01:24:26,959 --> 01:24:29,560
[SPEAKER_25]: Like the whole part of that nation?

1074
01:24:29,920 --> 01:24:30,540
[SPEAKER_25]: New England, all of them?

1075
01:24:33,418 --> 01:24:36,578
[SPEAKER_25]: Oh, I'm totally not even paying attention to the Skype line.

1076
01:24:36,598 --> 01:24:37,559
[SPEAKER_25]: There's another call coming in.

1077
01:24:37,579 --> 01:24:38,019
[SPEAKER_25]: Let's go to it.

1078
01:24:38,319 --> 01:24:39,439
[SPEAKER_25]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

1079
01:24:41,880 --> 01:24:43,480
[SPEAKER_25]: Hello, you are on Orange Lounge Radio.

1080
01:24:45,701 --> 01:24:47,101
[SPEAKER_05]: You're soon to not be on Orange Lounge Radio.

1081
01:24:47,461 --> 01:24:49,402
[SPEAKER_25]: I think we got a problem hearing you, buddy.

1082
01:24:49,442 --> 01:24:53,563
[SPEAKER_25]: Make sure that your microphones turn on and all that.

1083
01:24:56,264 --> 01:24:57,424
[SPEAKER_25]: Try talking to us one more time.

1084
01:24:59,185 --> 01:24:59,825
[SPEAKER_25]: Can't hear you, buddy.

1085
01:24:59,845 --> 01:25:00,765
[SPEAKER_25]: Sorry, we're going to have to let you go.

1086
01:25:02,372 --> 01:25:02,872
[SPEAKER_25]: That's a bummer.

1087
01:25:03,012 --> 01:25:03,713
[SPEAKER_25]: Let's go to here.

1088
01:25:03,993 --> 01:25:05,514
[SPEAKER_25]: Oh, I think we got... Did we get it?

1089
01:25:05,694 --> 01:25:06,595
[SPEAKER_25]: Hi, you're on Orange Sounds Radio.

1090
01:25:07,155 --> 01:25:08,396
[SPEAKER_25]: Yo, Skye, Siggy here.

1091
01:25:08,536 --> 01:25:09,237
[SPEAKER_25]: Hi, Siggy.

1092
01:25:10,017 --> 01:25:11,438
[SPEAKER_25]: Ah, finally.

1093
01:25:11,478 --> 01:25:15,201
[SPEAKER_25]: Real quick, I gotta offer one piece of advice to prospective people calling in.

1094
01:25:15,994 --> 01:25:21,257
[SPEAKER_25]: If you're going to call the show, before you call us, add this username to your Skype list.

1095
01:25:21,337 --> 01:25:22,137
[SPEAKER_25]: Give them a call.

1096
01:25:22,658 --> 01:25:25,159
[SPEAKER_25]: Echo123.

1097
01:25:25,259 --> 01:25:26,680
[SPEAKER_25]: It's Echo123.

1098
01:25:27,060 --> 01:25:29,381
[SPEAKER_25]: And when you call that, you can hear yourself.

1099
01:25:29,762 --> 01:25:31,162
[SPEAKER_25]: It's like literally an echo.

1100
01:25:31,503 --> 01:25:33,404
[SPEAKER_25]: So you can tell if your Skype line is working or not.

1101
01:25:33,484 --> 01:25:35,045
[SPEAKER_25]: So really good tip for you guys.

1102
01:25:35,105 --> 01:25:35,985
[SPEAKER_25]: So give that a try.

1103
01:25:36,365 --> 01:25:37,426
[SPEAKER_25]: Anyway, what's on your mind, Siggy?

1104
01:25:38,086 --> 01:25:39,627
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, it's about night style.

1105
01:25:40,788 --> 01:25:42,209
[SPEAKER_25]: Ah, yes, night style.

1106
01:25:42,229 --> 01:25:42,949
[SPEAKER_25]: What's up with night style?

1107
01:25:43,766 --> 01:25:46,427
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't get me wrong, great idea, great concept, a lot of people there need help.

1108
01:26:12,745 --> 01:26:16,128
[SPEAKER_25]: But, you know, there's other good organizations out there to donate to, too.

1109
01:26:16,188 --> 01:26:16,828
[SPEAKER_25]: That's all I want to say.

1110
01:26:17,328 --> 01:26:17,629
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

1111
01:26:18,169 --> 01:26:22,793
[SPEAKER_06]: So, have you seen the cover art for Night Style?

1112
01:26:22,933 --> 01:26:26,876
[SPEAKER_25]: I did see the cover art for Night Style, but I didn't show it to the other people in studio.

1113
01:26:28,237 --> 01:26:30,178
[SPEAKER_25]: And now I have no idea where the box art went.

1114
01:26:30,478 --> 01:26:31,579
[SPEAKER_25]: That's because Rob's lousy.

1115
01:26:32,340 --> 01:26:33,320
[SPEAKER_25]: I know, I'm horrible.

1116
01:26:33,661 --> 01:26:35,682
[SPEAKER_25]: I will dig it up, though, the box art.

1117
01:26:35,702 --> 01:26:36,843
[SPEAKER_25]: What did you think of the box art?

1118
01:26:37,355 --> 01:26:39,978
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, it's really fine to me, actually.

1119
01:26:40,038 --> 01:26:42,421
[SPEAKER_06]: Everybody at the Monty Stall has been complaining about it.

1120
01:26:42,822 --> 01:26:43,182
[SPEAKER_25]: You know what?

1121
01:26:43,242 --> 01:26:45,405
[SPEAKER_25]: And when I looked at it, it looked fine to me, too.

1122
01:26:45,545 --> 01:26:47,207
[SPEAKER_25]: I don't know what the people are bitching about, really.

1123
01:26:47,307 --> 01:26:50,170
[SPEAKER_25]: It's better than some of the other ones, I think.

1124
01:26:51,654 --> 01:26:57,336
[SPEAKER_06]: They're actually buying what's in the game, not what's on the cover, right?

1125
01:26:57,476 --> 01:26:58,016
[SPEAKER_25]: Very good point.

1126
01:26:58,237 --> 01:27:00,157
[SPEAKER_25]: Here it is, for those of you in the studio.

1127
01:27:00,437 --> 01:27:04,199
[SPEAKER_25]: Actually, I can post this as well, ha ha ha, in our chat room.

1128
01:27:04,519 --> 01:27:07,220
[SPEAKER_25]: Here is a picture of the 9th style cover.

1129
01:27:07,920 --> 01:27:08,680
[SPEAKER_25]: What do you guys think of that?

1130
01:27:11,181 --> 01:27:12,562
[SPEAKER_05]: It looks a lot like Loki's head.

1131
01:27:14,202 --> 01:27:14,703
[SPEAKER_25]: It looks cool.

1132
01:27:15,343 --> 01:27:17,084
[SPEAKER_05]: That's kind of rad.

1133
01:27:18,044 --> 01:27:18,264
Yeah.

1134
01:27:19,403 --> 01:27:20,324
[SPEAKER_25]: I don't see the problem with it.

1135
01:27:20,484 --> 01:27:25,431
[SPEAKER_25]: I mean, they've got your mandatory DJ girl on it, so... Yeah, Iroha and Eri.

1136
01:27:26,272 --> 01:27:26,572
[SPEAKER_25]: Uh-huh.

1137
01:27:28,755 --> 01:27:30,597
[SPEAKER_25]: Are those the two new characters in 9th Style?

1138
01:27:31,278 --> 01:27:35,002
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, they're the 2DX DJs representing 9th Style.

1139
01:27:35,022 --> 01:27:35,743
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what I thought.

1140
01:27:36,204 --> 01:27:37,025
[SPEAKER_06]: Iroha and Eri.

1141
01:27:37,813 --> 01:27:39,995
[SPEAKER_25]: That's what I thought, and it looks fine to me.

1142
01:27:40,715 --> 01:27:42,857
[SPEAKER_25]: Look at that, it looks like she just got a manicure today.

1143
01:27:44,498 --> 01:27:52,984
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, those people who have been complaining, they were thinking of the actual poster as the cover art for Night Style.

1144
01:27:54,945 --> 01:27:57,167
[SPEAKER_25]: Oh, because that was the poster as well?

1145
01:27:57,607 --> 01:27:58,828
[SPEAKER_06]: It's supposed to be the poster.

1146
01:27:59,148 --> 01:28:01,069
[SPEAKER_25]: So Konami got a little lazy, who cares?

1147
01:28:01,830 --> 01:28:02,030
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

1148
01:28:04,114 --> 01:28:08,335
[SPEAKER_25]: I'm happy as hell that we're getting Night Style in the first place.

1149
01:28:09,115 --> 01:28:13,276
[SPEAKER_25]: If they're going to get a little sloppy and make the poster the same thing as the cover art, I don't care.

1150
01:28:13,976 --> 01:28:14,876
[SPEAKER_25]: It's a fine picture.

1151
01:28:15,797 --> 01:28:20,718
[SPEAKER_06]: I would be more much happy if they put a reincarnation back on Night Style.

1152
01:28:20,738 --> 01:28:23,858
[SPEAKER_06]: Aren't they supposed to be bringing a bunch of songs back?

1153
01:28:25,199 --> 01:28:31,180
[SPEAKER_06]: Actually, I already mentioned to you last time that there would be three songs that would mostly come back.

1154
01:28:32,486 --> 01:28:36,728
[SPEAKER_25]: Right, well, because aren't there songs that have new anothers that need to be accounted for?

1155
01:28:36,888 --> 01:28:38,089
[SPEAKER_25]: Yeah.

1156
01:28:38,109 --> 01:28:40,490
[SPEAKER_06]: Jam, Screams, Minimalian, and Checking You Out.

1157
01:28:40,550 --> 01:28:41,671
[SPEAKER_25]: Right, right, okay, that's right.

1158
01:28:42,811 --> 01:28:45,273
[SPEAKER_25]: Hmm.

1159
01:28:45,313 --> 01:28:47,093
[SPEAKER_25]: Well, it sounds like it's going to be a good mix either way.

1160
01:28:47,113 --> 01:28:48,194
[SPEAKER_25]: I can't wait to hear more details.

1161
01:28:48,274 --> 01:28:49,795
[SPEAKER_25]: I can't wait to see that full song list.

1162
01:28:50,375 --> 01:28:59,740
[SPEAKER_25]: And what I really want to see, I want to see if we get any more preview tracks from 10th and 11th, and I want to see, and I know it's red, but I'm calling it 11th, I want to see if there are good preview songs.

1163
01:29:00,465 --> 01:29:02,166
[SPEAKER_25]: I want Kachak!

1164
01:29:02,686 --> 01:29:03,447
[SPEAKER_06]: I want Kachak!

1165
01:29:03,467 --> 01:29:03,727
[SPEAKER_25]: AGEHA!

1166
01:29:03,747 --> 01:29:03,927
[SPEAKER_25]: AGEHA!

1167
01:29:03,967 --> 01:29:04,127
[SPEAKER_25]: AGEHA!

1168
01:29:23,450 --> 01:29:25,451
[SPEAKER_25]: All right, well, you've been listening to the show long enough.

1169
01:29:25,491 --> 01:29:27,632
[SPEAKER_25]: You know I'm really white when it comes to my pronunciation.

1170
01:29:27,992 --> 01:29:30,653
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, but I'm always here to help you out.

1171
01:29:30,853 --> 01:29:31,953
[SPEAKER_25]: Well, I appreciate it.

1172
01:29:32,213 --> 01:29:33,614
[SPEAKER_25]: It's the beauty of the Skype line.

1173
01:29:33,654 --> 01:29:35,595
[SPEAKER_25]: I can be corrected almost in person.

1174
01:29:35,675 --> 01:29:36,095
[SPEAKER_25]: It's great.

1175
01:29:36,415 --> 01:29:37,996
[SPEAKER_07]: You can be corrected in person.

1176
01:29:38,036 --> 01:29:40,757
[SPEAKER_25]: Yeah, when Jamie isn't here to correct me in person, you are.

1177
01:29:40,877 --> 01:29:41,917
[SPEAKER_25]: It's beautiful.

1178
01:29:41,937 --> 01:29:42,097
[SPEAKER_25]: Shut up.

1179
01:29:44,522 --> 01:29:44,762
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

1180
01:29:45,062 --> 01:29:47,163
[SPEAKER_06]: And there's another one that you mispronounced it a lot.

1181
01:29:47,583 --> 01:29:50,603
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, the artist, the cheer train, it was actually Fujita Blender.

1182
01:29:50,803 --> 01:29:51,404
[SPEAKER_25]: Fujita.

1183
01:29:51,784 --> 01:29:52,024
[SPEAKER_25]: Yeah.

1184
01:29:52,324 --> 01:29:56,065
[SPEAKER_25]: I like Fusita.

1185
01:29:56,485 --> 01:29:56,945
[SPEAKER_25]: All right.

1186
01:29:57,305 --> 01:30:01,586
[SPEAKER_25]: We're going to let you go because we're getting other calls and I want to let you get back to that AOL conversation you're having in the background.

1187
01:30:01,686 --> 01:30:01,946
[SPEAKER_25]: All right?

1188
01:30:02,446 --> 01:30:02,686
[SPEAKER_24]: All right.

1189
01:30:02,946 --> 01:30:03,406
[SPEAKER_25]: Have a good one.

1190
01:30:03,906 --> 01:30:04,146
[SPEAKER_24]: Later.

1191
01:30:04,327 --> 01:30:04,587
[SPEAKER_25]: Bye.

1192
01:30:06,047 --> 01:30:06,887
[SPEAKER_25]: We got another call.

1193
01:30:06,907 --> 01:30:09,008
[SPEAKER_25]: We'll take one more call and maybe we'll go to Cage Match after this.

1194
01:30:09,648 --> 01:30:09,928
[SPEAKER_25]: I don't know.

1195
01:30:10,068 --> 01:30:10,348
[SPEAKER_07]: Please.

1196
01:30:10,368 --> 01:30:10,768
[SPEAKER_25]: All right.

1197
01:30:11,677 --> 01:30:13,578
[SPEAKER_25]: What, you don't like talking to people on the Skype line?

1198
01:30:13,598 --> 01:30:15,038
[SPEAKER_07]: I like talking to people, but I'm ready for the cage match.

1199
01:30:15,639 --> 01:30:16,659
[SPEAKER_25]: Oh, you want to bring it on.

1200
01:30:17,439 --> 01:30:19,020
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I just don't really care.

1201
01:30:19,040 --> 01:30:20,840
[SPEAKER_25]: Alright, let me get to this person here.

1202
01:30:20,860 --> 01:30:21,821
[SPEAKER_07]: It's already been brought in.

1203
01:30:22,441 --> 01:30:26,542
[SPEAKER_25]: Let me get to this poor person who's sitting here on the Skype line waiting for us to acknowledge their presence.

1204
01:30:26,963 --> 01:30:28,283
[SPEAKER_25]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

1205
01:30:28,903 --> 01:30:30,584
[SPEAKER_25]: Hey, Sky, it's El Mullet again.

1206
01:30:30,664 --> 01:30:32,044
[SPEAKER_25]: Hello, El Mullet.

1207
01:30:32,544 --> 01:30:33,525
[SPEAKER_25]: What is going on?

1208
01:30:33,585 --> 01:30:36,506
[SPEAKER_25]: You guys are just digging through Konami's site right now.

1209
01:30:36,566 --> 01:30:38,727
[SPEAKER_25]: You're posting all these crazy banners.

1210
01:30:38,807 --> 01:30:39,467
[SPEAKER_25]: What's going on?

1211
01:30:40,100 --> 01:30:43,263
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, all these crazy banners equal two that I found.

1212
01:30:44,063 --> 01:30:46,205
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, that's more than I found.

1213
01:30:47,606 --> 01:30:51,629
[SPEAKER_00]: I just put in two random words and I pulled out two things.

1214
01:30:52,350 --> 01:30:53,210
[SPEAKER_00]: I have no idea.

1215
01:30:53,671 --> 01:30:57,094
[SPEAKER_25]: So you're trying to think of like four letter words that might come up with something.

1216
01:30:57,774 --> 01:30:58,815
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, something like that.

1217
01:31:00,476 --> 01:31:01,297
[SPEAKER_25]: Wow, and you found two.

1218
01:31:01,557 --> 01:31:02,638
[SPEAKER_25]: What do you think this all is?

1219
01:31:02,658 --> 01:31:03,819
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you think this all adds up to?

1220
01:31:05,089 --> 01:31:07,110
[SPEAKER_00]: I wouldn't read too much into it personally.

1221
01:31:07,430 --> 01:31:13,594
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I'm sure that there's some sort of explanation why we've managed to pull up five licensed songs.

1222
01:31:14,675 --> 01:31:19,118
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm thinking maybe, you know, they were there, but now they're not there, you know.

1223
01:31:19,418 --> 01:31:20,218
[SPEAKER_25]: Five songs?

1224
01:31:20,839 --> 01:31:22,400
[SPEAKER_25]: Five songs in a song pack?

1225
01:31:22,500 --> 01:31:25,281
[SPEAKER_25]: Loki, Loki's tapping my leg for some reason.

1226
01:31:25,381 --> 01:31:29,484
[SPEAKER_25]: It might be noticed, or I might mention that not only...

1227
01:31:30,091 --> 01:31:58,885
[SPEAKER_25]: by putting into those directories are you pulling up stuff from Ultramix 2 but Ultramix 1 so I could theorize it could be also Ultramix 3 now that's a good thought there maybe these are possible Ultramix 3 songs or Ultramix 7 by doing the same thing so that's Ultramix 1 interesting because we all know Ultramix 3 has to happen at this point it has to has to happen and if it doesn't happen there will be burnination going on

1228
01:32:00,513 --> 01:32:02,775
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to mount all this banner finding.

1229
01:32:02,815 --> 01:32:10,240
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember when a picture was leaked that had the Take It to the Morning Light banner from DDR Max and it had an SP4 icon on it?

1230
01:32:10,360 --> 01:32:11,400
[SPEAKER_25]: I remember that.

1231
01:32:11,500 --> 01:32:12,041
[SPEAKER_25]: I remember that.

1232
01:32:12,101 --> 01:32:12,921
[SPEAKER_25]: And it didn't mean shit.

1233
01:32:12,941 --> 01:32:14,722
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it didn't mean shit.

1234
01:32:14,943 --> 01:32:18,845
[SPEAKER_00]: What we could be pulling up right now could very well not be meaning shit at all.

1235
01:32:19,506 --> 01:32:21,367
[SPEAKER_25]: But then again... They're pretty banners.

1236
01:32:21,427 --> 01:32:23,028
[SPEAKER_25]: That Crazy in Love banner is kind of cute.

1237
01:32:24,257 --> 01:32:24,997
[SPEAKER_25]: I need that song.

1238
01:32:25,017 --> 01:32:26,238
[SPEAKER_25]: I need to play it Tuesday.

1239
01:32:26,258 --> 01:32:26,698
[SPEAKER_25]: I have plenty of...

1240
01:32:49,522 --> 01:32:52,104
[SPEAKER_25]: Yeah, maybe we'll grab a little clip of it off the iTunes store.

1241
01:32:52,124 --> 01:32:54,205
[SPEAKER_25]: How could anybody have not heard Crazy in Love, though?

1242
01:32:54,285 --> 01:32:54,625
[SPEAKER_25]: Seriously.

1243
01:32:54,965 --> 01:32:57,807
[SPEAKER_25]: Our listeners, you've got to be living in a cave if you've never heard Crazy in Love.

1244
01:32:57,867 --> 01:33:01,829
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just my spin teacher plays that in spin class, and it's fun.

1245
01:33:02,710 --> 01:33:02,970
[SPEAKER_25]: Hold on.

1246
01:33:03,010 --> 01:33:06,032
[SPEAKER_25]: I'm sorry, Elmola, but now Jamie's got me on a different subject here.

1247
01:33:06,072 --> 01:33:07,413
[SPEAKER_25]: We've got to play a little clip here.

1248
01:33:07,833 --> 01:33:08,193
[SPEAKER_25]: Here it is.

1249
01:33:08,253 --> 01:33:08,533
[SPEAKER_25]: Here it is.

1250
01:33:17,819 --> 01:33:18,139
[SPEAKER_02]: Come on.

1251
01:33:18,159 --> 01:33:19,120
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't you want to shake your booty?

1252
01:33:31,637 --> 01:33:32,458
[SPEAKER_25]: This is the part I like.

1253
01:33:33,298 --> 01:33:33,919
[SPEAKER_25]: Oh, I'm sorry.

1254
01:33:34,079 --> 01:33:35,160
[SPEAKER_25]: I totally cut it off right there.

1255
01:33:39,823 --> 01:33:41,164
[SPEAKER_25]: Those could be cool little gallops.

1256
01:33:41,625 --> 01:33:42,085
[SPEAKER_25]: Come on.

1257
01:33:42,826 --> 01:33:44,107
[SPEAKER_25]: That would have been a great DDR song.

1258
01:33:45,188 --> 01:33:46,789
[SPEAKER_25]: I hope the Ultramix 3 thing is the case.

1259
01:33:46,949 --> 01:33:48,290
[SPEAKER_25]: Or a song pack, but we'll see.

1260
01:33:49,551 --> 01:33:52,033
[SPEAKER_25]: I have a feeling that we're being fucked with, and it doesn't mean shit.

1261
01:33:53,461 --> 01:34:00,282
[SPEAKER_00]: Not only were we pulling licensed banners, we also pulled two Konami original banners.

1262
01:34:01,183 --> 01:34:04,123
[SPEAKER_00]: Cutris pulled off GMD and Hold On Me.

1263
01:34:04,183 --> 01:34:04,703
[SPEAKER_24]: That's right.

1264
01:34:05,383 --> 01:34:07,824
[SPEAKER_00]: So who knows where that's going.

1265
01:34:08,124 --> 01:34:11,625
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's seven songs, so it's not a true song pack.

1266
01:34:13,145 --> 01:34:13,525
[SPEAKER_25]: That's true.

1267
01:34:13,565 --> 01:34:14,625
[SPEAKER_25]: So there's more than five.

1268
01:34:14,765 --> 01:34:17,166
[SPEAKER_00]: So who knows what's going on.

1269
01:34:19,298 --> 01:34:22,180
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure an explanation will be offered, you know, eventually.

1270
01:34:22,500 --> 01:34:25,582
[SPEAKER_00]: Like how Song Pack 8 is going to be released eventually.

1271
01:34:49,845 --> 01:34:56,590
[SPEAKER_25]: You know that if trying to find something secret that you're not supposed to see on some website is involved, Loki's in on it.

1272
01:34:57,931 --> 01:34:59,352
[SPEAKER_25]: Anything else you want to share with us, Amolet?

1273
01:35:00,313 --> 01:35:01,233
[SPEAKER_00]: That's pretty much it.

1274
01:35:01,273 --> 01:35:03,935
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the big topic of conversation right now, after all.

1275
01:35:04,055 --> 01:35:04,696
[SPEAKER_25]: You know what?

1276
01:35:06,017 --> 01:35:19,006
[SPEAKER_25]: Unfortunately, the way things work in the Mamani scene is it seems like now we're getting in this rhythm of getting all our games at the end of the year in the Christmas season, which makes everything post-Christmas to E3 a real dead period.

1277
01:35:20,802 --> 01:35:23,043
[SPEAKER_25]: But that's why we talk about other stuff, too.

1278
01:35:23,103 --> 01:35:23,644
[SPEAKER_25]: What can we say?

1279
01:35:24,444 --> 01:35:24,864
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.

1280
01:35:25,044 --> 01:35:25,385
[SPEAKER_25]: All right.

1281
01:35:25,605 --> 01:35:26,545
[SPEAKER_25]: Hey, plug your site.

1282
01:35:27,646 --> 01:35:28,967
[SPEAKER_00]: InsidePulse.com.

1283
01:35:30,227 --> 01:35:30,768
[SPEAKER_00]: Visit it.

1284
01:35:31,668 --> 01:35:32,509
[SPEAKER_00]: Love us, damn it.

1285
01:35:32,809 --> 01:35:33,269
[SPEAKER_00]: Love us.

1286
01:35:34,009 --> 01:35:34,670
[SPEAKER_25]: But not too much.

1287
01:35:35,590 --> 01:35:36,171
[SPEAKER_00]: Not too much.

1288
01:35:36,291 --> 01:35:39,332
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, love us to the extent of you're not being creepy about it.

1289
01:35:39,452 --> 01:35:39,733
[SPEAKER_25]: All right.

1290
01:35:39,933 --> 01:35:40,413
[SPEAKER_25]: Sounds good.

1291
01:35:40,713 --> 01:35:43,495
[SPEAKER_25]: So visit Inside Pulse and read the Elmullet column.

1292
01:35:44,876 --> 01:35:46,637
[SPEAKER_25]: Actually, it's not called the Elmullet column, though.

1293
01:35:48,277 --> 01:35:48,838
[SPEAKER_25]: But look for it.

1294
01:35:48,878 --> 01:35:49,218
[SPEAKER_25]: It's great.

1295
01:35:51,089 --> 01:35:52,050
[SPEAKER_25]: Alright, thanks for the call.

1296
01:35:52,890 --> 01:35:53,071
[SPEAKER_25]: Bye.

1297
01:35:53,251 --> 01:35:53,711
[SPEAKER_25]: Have a good one.

1298
01:36:19,722 --> 01:36:20,482
[SPEAKER_25]: I can't explain it.

1299
01:36:20,522 --> 01:36:20,983
[SPEAKER_25]: It's crazy.

1300
01:36:23,084 --> 01:36:23,524
[SPEAKER_25]: All right.

1301
01:36:24,704 --> 01:36:30,827
[SPEAKER_25]: As a reminder, you guys, to participate in this next segment, you're going to want to be in our chat room, www.orangeloungeradio.com.

1302
01:36:31,207 --> 01:36:32,368
[SPEAKER_25]: Click on chat.

1303
01:36:32,468 --> 01:36:34,989
[SPEAKER_25]: It is time for the Orange Lounge Radio Cage Match.

1304
01:36:37,290 --> 01:36:47,274
[SPEAKER_25]: Last week in the Orange Lounge Radio Cage Match, it kind of surprised us because Echo Image was given the boot from the Cage Match, and it was replaced by...

1305
01:36:48,106 --> 01:36:56,077
[SPEAKER_25]: Dream, that's right, J-pop artist Dream, with their rendition of Night of Fire, the song you might recognize from 2DX, Parapara.

1306
01:36:56,497 --> 01:37:00,563
[SPEAKER_25]: It was Jamie's pick, so that's going to be the first song you guys hear tonight.

1307
01:37:00,703 --> 01:37:04,088
[SPEAKER_25]: As a reminder, the way the cage match works, you hear three songs.

1308
01:37:04,808 --> 01:37:06,429
[SPEAKER_25]: One of them you hear a clip of.

1309
01:37:06,489 --> 01:37:07,950
[SPEAKER_25]: It's the song that won last week.

1310
01:37:08,251 --> 01:37:11,052
[SPEAKER_25]: Two songs you hear brand new in their entirety.

1311
01:37:11,653 --> 01:37:19,598
[SPEAKER_25]: And you're going to pick your favorite and the winning song goes into rotation all week long on Orange Lounge Radio's Bomani Music and More program.

1312
01:37:19,678 --> 01:37:20,419
[SPEAKER_25]: You get the vote.

1313
01:37:21,059 --> 01:37:21,660
[SPEAKER_25]: So here it is.

1314
01:37:21,780 --> 01:37:23,561
[SPEAKER_25]: Song number one you get to pick from tonight.

1315
01:37:24,221 --> 01:37:26,563
[SPEAKER_25]: Last week's winner, Dream, Night of Fire.

1316
01:37:32,660 --> 01:37:33,781
Thank you for watching!

1317
01:38:03,288 --> 01:38:09,090
[SPEAKER_14]: More deeply, I want to know the truth of you Don't say sweet, kind words Because it will stain my heart and make me feel like crying

1318
01:38:45,337 --> 01:38:48,199
[SPEAKER_14]: Night of Fire, I'm so happy to be with you.

1319
01:38:48,219 --> 01:38:50,761
Night of Fire, I want to feel fate with you.

1320
01:38:50,781 --> 01:38:55,044
Night of Fire, I can't say it, but there are days when I want you to hug me.

1321
01:38:55,064 --> 01:38:56,825
Night of Fire, I'm attracted to you.

1322
01:38:56,845 --> 01:38:58,906
Night of Fire, I don't know what to do.

1323
01:39:22,370 --> 01:39:23,570
[SPEAKER_14]: Thanks for watching!

1324
01:39:47,430 --> 01:39:53,131
[SPEAKER_25]: Alright, song number one in tonight's cage match, last week's winner, Dream, Night of Fire.

1325
01:39:53,311 --> 01:39:54,191
[SPEAKER_25]: Will it win again?

1326
01:39:54,672 --> 01:39:55,192
[SPEAKER_25]: We'll see.

1327
01:39:55,252 --> 01:39:57,192
[SPEAKER_25]: We've got to bring in two challengers, though, first.

1328
01:39:57,872 --> 01:40:00,173
[SPEAKER_25]: First up, my pick, yay, me.

1329
01:40:01,373 --> 01:40:04,814
[SPEAKER_25]: I'm going to pick a band that has won the cage match a couple times.

1330
01:40:05,214 --> 01:40:10,395
[SPEAKER_25]: It's a real popular band amongst, I think, the folks that play DDR, although it's not a DDR band.

1331
01:40:11,550 --> 01:40:11,930
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

1332
01:40:12,391 --> 01:40:13,952
[SPEAKER_25]: Yay, Freeze Pop.

1333
01:40:13,972 --> 01:40:14,172
[SPEAKER_25]: Enjoy.

1334
01:40:41,364 --> 01:40:44,286
[SPEAKER_14]: I know you work across the street in the indie record store.

1335
01:40:44,306 --> 01:40:46,107
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm thinking someday that we'll meet.

1336
01:40:46,167 --> 01:40:47,608
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm thinking we'll do something more.

1337
01:40:47,668 --> 01:40:48,629
[SPEAKER_14]: I hide behind my magazine.

1338
01:40:48,649 --> 01:40:49,709
[SPEAKER_14]: Then I see you walk on by.

1339
01:40:49,769 --> 01:40:50,690
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm not ready to be seen.

1340
01:40:50,870 --> 01:40:51,310
[SPEAKER_14]: I'll just

1341
01:41:47,552 --> 01:41:50,880
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm on a stakeout I'm on a stakeout I'm on a stakeout

1342
01:42:09,714 --> 01:42:10,816
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you for watching!

1343
01:42:39,291 --> 01:42:48,420
[SPEAKER_14]: The feeling is elating, biding my time Yeah, I know that you'll soon be mine Soon to mine Can't let you see me Can't let you see me Can't let you see me

1344
01:43:45,183 --> 01:43:47,905
[SPEAKER_14]: All right, first challenger tonight, song number two, Freeze Pop, Stake Out.

1345
01:43:47,925 --> 01:43:50,907
Did that song stick out in your mind, or would you like to take it out to the trash?

1346
01:43:50,927 --> 01:43:51,107
Jamie.

1347
01:43:51,127 --> 01:43:51,287
Jamie.

1348
01:44:11,914 --> 01:44:14,355
[SPEAKER_07]: I like Freeze Pop, but that song just didn't do it for me.

1349
01:44:15,236 --> 01:44:17,657
[SPEAKER_07]: Still, it was a good song, so they get a 7.

1350
01:44:18,678 --> 01:44:19,958
[SPEAKER_25]: Alright, 7 from Jamie.

1351
01:44:20,499 --> 01:44:20,819
[SPEAKER_25]: Bugs!

1352
01:44:24,160 --> 01:44:28,002
[SPEAKER_25]: Can't hear you, you gotta practically give head to that mic, you gotta get that close.

1353
01:44:28,263 --> 01:44:30,804
[SPEAKER_05]: There you go, now talk.

1354
01:44:31,744 --> 01:44:32,985
[SPEAKER_05]: I like Freeze Pop, I give it a 9.

1355
01:44:33,125 --> 01:44:33,525
[SPEAKER_25]: Perfect.

1356
01:44:34,006 --> 01:44:34,426
[SPEAKER_25]: Okay, good.

1357
01:44:34,446 --> 01:44:34,566
[SPEAKER_25]: Angel!

1358
01:44:34,626 --> 01:44:34,826
[SPEAKER_25]: Angel!

1359
01:44:36,038 --> 01:44:39,080
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't give a shit, you know what?

1360
01:44:39,140 --> 01:44:40,281
[SPEAKER_08]: I hate that fucking song.

1361
01:44:40,301 --> 01:44:40,922
[SPEAKER_08]: It's awful.

1362
01:44:41,422 --> 01:44:42,122
[SPEAKER_08]: It gets a 1.

1363
01:44:42,163 --> 01:44:42,383
[SPEAKER_08]: AWFUL!

1364
01:45:05,120 --> 01:45:08,003
[SPEAKER_25]: I'm sorry, talking over synthesizers is not fucking music.

1365
01:45:08,283 --> 01:45:08,403
[SPEAKER_07]: Awful.

1366
01:45:08,423 --> 01:45:09,924
[SPEAKER_07]: At least it's not a negative number.

1367
01:45:11,926 --> 01:45:13,247
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't give my BS.

1368
01:45:13,387 --> 01:45:21,114
[SPEAKER_25]: Yes, whereas a song that is over synth to all hell, so it's GROSS, GROSS, GROSS, is music.

1369
01:45:22,756 --> 01:45:26,019
[SPEAKER_25]: Did I never... I never said it was good when I put it in, okay?

1370
01:45:26,039 --> 01:45:26,139
[SPEAKER_25]: Yeah.

1371
01:45:27,975 --> 01:45:34,084
[SPEAKER_25]: Last time I checked, you're supposed to like the songs, at least somewhat, that you are going to put in the cagement.

1372
01:45:34,344 --> 01:45:35,306
[SPEAKER_25]: Call me crazy.

1373
01:45:35,386 --> 01:45:36,447
[SPEAKER_25]: Maybe you missed that memo.

1374
01:45:36,467 --> 01:45:36,908
[SPEAKER_14]: Crazy.

1375
01:45:37,289 --> 01:45:37,589
[SPEAKER_25]: All right.

1376
01:45:37,629 --> 01:45:37,990
[SPEAKER_14]: Anyway.

1377
01:45:38,531 --> 01:45:38,951
[SPEAKER_25]: Anyway.

1378
01:45:40,574 --> 01:45:42,016
[SPEAKER_25]: My thoughts on Freeze Pop.

1379
01:45:42,842 --> 01:45:45,184
[SPEAKER_25]: I feel completely opposite from Loki.

1380
01:45:45,304 --> 01:45:50,247
[SPEAKER_25]: I think the minimalist synth sound that they have, I think that is what makes them so cool.

1381
01:45:50,687 --> 01:45:56,710
[SPEAKER_25]: And I love her voice, because she has this very, I don't care what you all think type thing in your voice.

1382
01:45:56,770 --> 01:45:57,811
[SPEAKER_25]: I love her voice.

1383
01:45:58,472 --> 01:46:02,194
[SPEAKER_25]: And the pop culture references are awesome, but they're not cheesy.

1384
01:46:02,254 --> 01:46:04,515
[SPEAKER_25]: Like, I've heard bands with cheesy pop culture references.

1385
01:46:04,635 --> 01:46:05,156
[SPEAKER_25]: It's bad.

1386
01:46:05,776 --> 01:46:06,256
[SPEAKER_25]: They're good.

1387
01:46:07,237 --> 01:46:07,457
[SPEAKER_25]: Yeah.

1388
01:46:07,890 --> 01:46:15,635
[SPEAKER_25]: Yeah, so I would give them like, I would give it like seriously like an 8.5, maybe a 9, 8.75, let's give it an 8.75, I like it a lot.

1389
01:46:16,536 --> 01:46:20,018
[SPEAKER_25]: Alright, let's get to song number 3, which is Loki's pick, what did he pick?

1390
01:46:21,660 --> 01:46:22,920
[SPEAKER_05]: Doesn't matter, it sucks.

1391
01:46:24,301 --> 01:46:26,203
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you, thank you.

1392
01:46:27,904 --> 01:46:33,788
[SPEAKER_25]: No, what I picked was, it was actually a song I had heard a while ago and I had downloaded just recently.

1393
01:46:34,511 --> 01:46:36,393
[SPEAKER_25]: for the hell of it, because I like the song.

1394
01:46:36,753 --> 01:46:38,154
[SPEAKER_05]: It's another freeze-pop song, isn't it?

1395
01:46:38,995 --> 01:46:41,117
[SPEAKER_25]: No, it's not a freeze-pop song, thank God.

1396
01:46:42,037 --> 01:46:43,058
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank God for that.

1397
01:46:43,839 --> 01:46:44,239
[SPEAKER_25]: Shit.

1398
01:46:44,780 --> 01:46:46,902
[SPEAKER_25]: No, this is The Killers with Somebody Told Me.

1399
01:46:48,083 --> 01:46:50,004
[SPEAKER_25]: And it would be perfect for Guitar Freaks.

1400
01:46:51,706 --> 01:46:55,229
[SPEAKER_25]: Alright, Loki says this is his Guitar Freaks song that he would like to see.

1401
01:46:55,269 --> 01:46:57,551
[SPEAKER_25]: The Killers, Somebody Told Me, song number three.

1402
01:46:57,671 --> 01:46:57,811
[SPEAKER_25]: Enjoy.

1403
01:46:57,831 --> 01:46:57,931
[SPEAKER_24]: Enjoy.

1404
01:47:02,677 --> 01:47:09,641
I'm breaking my back just to know your name Seventeen tracks and I'm hiding with this game

1405
01:47:35,951 --> 01:47:37,033
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you for watching!

1406
01:48:07,668 --> 01:48:11,089
DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft

1407
01:48:44,457 --> 01:49:01,349
Just have it ain't close in a place like this I said I have it ain't close in a place like this Bring it back down, bring it back down tonight Never thought I'd better leave my room in my blue night Somebody told me you had a boyfriend Who looked like his girlfriend

1408
01:49:15,960 --> 01:49:20,783
I said baby, baby, please But I just don't know now We all want to see you cry

1409
01:49:49,648 --> 01:49:50,568
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1410
01:50:37,324 --> 01:50:41,625
[SPEAKER_25]: Alright, that was song number three, The Killers, Somebody Told Me.

1411
01:50:42,406 --> 01:50:44,986
[SPEAKER_25]: Will we tell you to vote for that one or not?

1412
01:50:45,046 --> 01:50:46,707
[SPEAKER_25]: Even though it's not our decision, it's yours.

1413
01:50:46,787 --> 01:50:48,368
[SPEAKER_25]: But we'll tell you our opinion anyway.

1414
01:50:48,428 --> 01:50:48,728
[SPEAKER_25]: Jamie?

1415
01:50:49,168 --> 01:50:49,808
[SPEAKER_07]: I like that song.

1416
01:50:49,868 --> 01:50:50,408
[SPEAKER_07]: It gets a nine.

1417
01:50:51,889 --> 01:50:58,971
[SPEAKER_07]: I thought I've heard another version of it before, but since I don't listen to the radio, this is pretty new to me, so I like it a lot.

1418
01:50:59,351 --> 01:50:59,691
[SPEAKER_25]: Alright.

1419
01:51:00,251 --> 01:51:00,511
[SPEAKER_25]: Bug?

1420
01:51:02,792 --> 01:51:03,732
[SPEAKER_25]: I can't hear you, buddy.

1421
01:51:04,113 --> 01:51:04,613
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I know.

1422
01:51:06,417 --> 01:51:06,717
[SPEAKER_05]: Negative 7.

1423
01:51:06,757 --> 01:51:09,178
[SPEAKER_25]: I've been hearing it all week.

1424
01:51:09,278 --> 01:51:09,518
[SPEAKER_25]: Angel.

1425
01:51:11,119 --> 01:51:11,639
[SPEAKER_08]: It's pretty good.

1426
01:51:11,659 --> 01:51:12,239
[SPEAKER_08]: What are you rocking?

1427
01:51:12,379 --> 01:51:15,400
[SPEAKER_08]: Eight and a half.

1428
01:51:17,921 --> 01:51:20,122
[SPEAKER_25]: This, boys and girls, let this be a lesson to you.

1429
01:51:20,182 --> 01:51:25,063
[SPEAKER_25]: If you're thinking right now that this song is overplayed, it's time for you to turn off the radio.

1430
01:51:25,203 --> 01:51:25,704
[SPEAKER_25]: Seriously.

1431
01:51:26,124 --> 01:51:30,005
[SPEAKER_25]: And start listening to internet radio and other forms of entertainment that's out there.

1432
01:51:30,592 --> 01:51:30,672
[SPEAKER_25]: LOKI

1433
01:52:00,620 --> 01:52:03,841
[SPEAKER_25]: Night of Fire Night of Fire More deeply Your...

1434
01:52:29,051 --> 01:52:31,792
[SPEAKER_25]: And song number two, Freeze Pop, Stakeout.

1435
01:52:32,652 --> 01:52:36,153
[SPEAKER_14]: And song number three that you can vote for tonight, The Killers, Somebody Told Me.

1436
01:52:36,173 --> 01:52:38,294
[SPEAKER_14]: Somebody told me that I'm living without you.

1437
01:52:38,334 --> 01:52:39,915
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm ready, let's roll on to something new.

1438
01:52:57,573 --> 01:53:00,894
[SPEAKER_25]: Alright, place vote now.

1439
01:53:01,054 --> 01:53:08,816
[SPEAKER_25]: Send a private message to Sky in the chat room with your vote and we'll add it all up and let you guys know who the winner is.

1440
01:53:08,936 --> 01:53:11,516
[SPEAKER_25]: Song number one, song number two, or song number three.

1441
01:53:12,496 --> 01:53:18,838
[SPEAKER_25]: Meanwhile, Orange Lounge Radio moves right along and I gotta ask Loki a question I ask Loki every week.

1442
01:53:20,202 --> 01:53:21,923
[SPEAKER_25]: What the hell's going on in the sim scene now?

1443
01:53:22,444 --> 01:53:22,824
[SPEAKER_25]: Anything?

1444
01:53:25,667 --> 01:53:26,808
[SPEAKER_25]: I don't think so, really.

1445
01:53:27,728 --> 01:53:35,215
[SPEAKER_25]: Other than just people, you know, being afraid about, you know, DRA coming after them for downloading sim files and that type of thing.

1446
01:53:37,216 --> 01:53:38,577
[SPEAKER_25]: Still, the websites are down.

1447
01:53:38,698 --> 01:53:41,380
[SPEAKER_25]: DDR Mania X and DDR UK.

1448
01:53:41,400 --> 01:53:41,780
[SPEAKER_25]: One of the

1449
01:53:43,448 --> 01:53:46,574
[SPEAKER_25]: 2 of the big 3 that are out there are down.

1450
01:53:46,735 --> 01:53:54,049
[SPEAKER_25]: And last week I mentioned there was a bunch of different sort of food mix type packs you can download or

1451
01:53:54,659 --> 01:54:00,361
[SPEAKER_25]: Check out, and once again, those are on the forums for Bill Monty's style.

1452
01:54:00,381 --> 01:54:01,261
[SPEAKER_25]: You can find those.

1453
01:54:01,721 --> 01:54:03,962
[SPEAKER_25]: Really, nothing's been going on.

1454
01:54:04,142 --> 01:54:07,643
[SPEAKER_25]: I think everyone's been just gearing up for Super Bowl or something like that.

1455
01:54:08,423 --> 01:54:10,144
[SPEAKER_25]: Because, really, there's nothing out there.

1456
01:54:10,364 --> 01:54:12,665
[SPEAKER_25]: I'm sure you'll see some more coming out, though, for the 2DX...

1457
01:54:14,366 --> 01:54:38,117
[SPEAKER_25]: Red stuff that's come out because obviously now that the OST rips aren't out there you can you know bet that there's going to be some of those sim files coming out but besides that really nothing else going on it's been just quiet and dead like all the websites so that's up that's everything kinda sucks

1458
01:54:40,788 --> 01:54:47,770
[SPEAKER_25]: You know, is it just that the sim file authors are using the Super Bowl as an excuse to have more time to look at Asian porn on the internet?

1459
01:54:50,391 --> 01:54:56,892
[SPEAKER_25]: I don't know why you'd want to look at Asian porn since Asian porn is censored, but sure, I guess.

1460
01:54:57,473 --> 01:54:58,913
[SPEAKER_05]: We can't see Loki's screen for a minute.

1461
01:54:58,933 --> 01:54:59,673
[SPEAKER_25]: Let me rephrase.

1462
01:54:59,773 --> 01:55:01,694
[SPEAKER_25]: Porn with big-tittied Asian girls.

1463
01:55:03,454 --> 01:55:05,075
[SPEAKER_25]: Okay, that's completely acceptable then.

1464
01:55:05,835 --> 01:55:06,055
[SPEAKER_24]: Can't.

1465
01:55:06,522 --> 01:55:07,983
[SPEAKER_25]: What was the one that I got from DarkSound?

1466
01:55:26,227 --> 01:55:32,570
[SPEAKER_25]: FinalFuckX was actually the first Asian full-on porn from Asia I'd actually seen.

1467
01:55:32,870 --> 01:55:35,371
[SPEAKER_25]: It was cosplay porn.

1468
01:55:35,551 --> 01:55:39,494
[SPEAKER_25]: Yes, it was cosplay porn with characters from Final Fantasy.

1469
01:55:39,834 --> 01:55:41,535
[SPEAKER_25]: Didn't we actually do this on the show?

1470
01:55:41,935 --> 01:55:44,736
[SPEAKER_25]: I want to say we actually played this on the show on an earlier episode.

1471
01:55:44,756 --> 01:55:45,076
[SPEAKER_25]: We didn't?

1472
01:55:45,417 --> 01:55:46,737
[SPEAKER_07]: No, maybe way back in the day.

1473
01:55:46,757 --> 01:55:48,118
[SPEAKER_07]: We did it as part of an afterbirth.

1474
01:55:48,318 --> 01:55:49,959
[SPEAKER_25]: We did the Dance Dance part.

1475
01:55:50,379 --> 01:55:50,959
[SPEAKER_25]: Porn, though.

1476
01:55:50,999 --> 01:55:55,301
[SPEAKER_25]: I remember Loki gave his review of the Dance Dance Porn, or what was it called?

1477
01:55:55,321 --> 01:55:56,822
[SPEAKER_25]: You remember Dance Dance Fuck or something?

1478
01:55:57,683 --> 01:55:58,403
[SPEAKER_25]: Something like that.

1479
01:55:58,623 --> 01:56:01,725
[SPEAKER_25]: I have it buried under here on my desk somewhere.

1480
01:56:02,045 --> 01:56:09,308
[SPEAKER_25]: Because I remember after I bought it or whatever, I watched it once and I go, okay, this is interesting, and then just kind of tossed it.

1481
01:56:09,688 --> 01:56:13,430
[SPEAKER_25]: And, you know, it became part of the mass collection of stuff on my desk.

1482
01:56:14,851 --> 01:56:14,871
[SPEAKER_25]: I...

1483
01:56:15,820 --> 01:56:17,722
[SPEAKER_25]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1484
01:56:36,670 --> 01:56:45,636
[SPEAKER_25]: For those that are unfamiliar out there, and I will show, this is more for the in-studio folks, there is DDR porn out there.

1485
01:56:46,397 --> 01:56:49,779
[SPEAKER_25]: Sadly enough, there is porn that exists.

1486
01:56:50,240 --> 01:56:51,581
[SPEAKER_25]: No, there's porn that's out there.

1487
01:56:52,241 --> 01:57:04,650
[SPEAKER_25]: And if you go here to the, but myself, image porns, and we go to the not work safe category here, we can see that there are some actual, you know...

1488
01:57:07,515 --> 01:57:08,255
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh my god!

1489
01:57:08,536 --> 01:57:09,356
[SPEAKER_09]: Get a life!

1490
01:57:09,936 --> 01:57:10,597
[SPEAKER_09]: All of you!

1491
01:57:11,237 --> 01:57:12,017
[SPEAKER_25]: Get a life!

1492
01:57:13,798 --> 01:57:17,540
[SPEAKER_25]: Those of you people posting on this board, what the hell is wrong with you?

1493
01:57:18,601 --> 01:57:22,943
[SPEAKER_25]: You're drawing pornography to... Ugh!

1494
01:57:24,964 --> 01:57:26,364
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just 4chan, get over it.

1495
01:57:32,908 --> 01:57:33,348
[SPEAKER_25]: Head hurts.

1496
01:57:33,368 --> 01:57:33,648
[SPEAKER_07]: Head hurts.

1497
01:57:36,502 --> 01:57:38,366
[SPEAKER_25]: Jamie, surely you have something to add on this.

1498
01:57:38,807 --> 01:57:39,268
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just 4chan.

1499
01:57:39,308 --> 01:57:44,319
[SPEAKER_07]: It's all things hentai.

1500
01:57:48,629 --> 01:57:50,971
[SPEAKER_25]: But it's DDR-ish characters.

1501
01:57:51,651 --> 01:57:53,533
[SPEAKER_25]: It looks like somebody drew that one.

1502
01:57:53,593 --> 01:57:55,034
[SPEAKER_25]: It looks like somebody painted that one.

1503
01:57:55,074 --> 01:57:56,115
[SPEAKER_25]: It said Max... Look!

1504
01:57:56,495 --> 01:57:57,015
[SPEAKER_25]: Colors!

1505
01:57:57,476 --> 01:58:00,438
[SPEAKER_25]: Beatmania 2DX characters book for adults only.

1506
01:58:00,798 --> 01:58:06,122
[SPEAKER_25]: Like, the song Colors, and you've got all these girls with big titties standing in front of Colors.

1507
01:58:06,142 --> 01:58:10,405
[SPEAKER_25]: There goes the cover.

1508
01:58:12,487 --> 01:58:13,067
[SPEAKER_25]: Oh, hooray.

1509
01:58:13,147 --> 01:58:13,568
[SPEAKER_25]: Yowie.

1510
01:58:13,828 --> 01:58:14,929
[SPEAKER_25]: Hooray, because that's any better.

1511
01:58:14,949 --> 01:58:16,430
[SPEAKER_14]: Sigh.

1512
01:58:18,797 --> 01:58:24,178
[SPEAKER_25]: Anyway, so the Dance Dance Porn or whatever it was, was... Huh?

1513
01:58:29,059 --> 01:58:29,379
[SPEAKER_25]: Great.

1514
01:58:30,320 --> 01:58:34,661
[SPEAKER_25]: What is that picture of Tran sitting there where you can totally see her clam?

1515
01:58:34,761 --> 01:58:35,421
[SPEAKER_25]: What is that?

1516
01:58:36,581 --> 01:58:37,501
[SPEAKER_25]: Her clam?

1517
01:58:39,222 --> 01:58:40,822
[SPEAKER_05]: Wow, way to go there, Rob.

1518
01:58:42,102 --> 01:58:42,862
[SPEAKER_05]: Welcome to the 90s.

1519
01:58:44,943 --> 01:58:45,343
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't care.

1520
01:58:51,723 --> 01:58:54,125
[SPEAKER_25]: Now they're all posting about it in the chatroom.

1521
01:58:54,445 --> 01:58:57,668
[SPEAKER_25]: At least you got them to stop typing in random four-letter words.

1522
01:58:57,888 --> 01:58:59,289
[SPEAKER_05]: Now this is going to get more ideas.

1523
01:58:59,309 --> 01:59:00,650
[SPEAKER_05]: They're going to try, like, 4chan.

1524
01:59:02,432 --> 01:59:05,194
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that the Orange Lounge characters naked?

1525
01:59:07,095 --> 01:59:08,016
[SPEAKER_25]: What is wrong?

1526
01:59:08,516 --> 01:59:09,297
[SPEAKER_25]: Seriously!

1527
01:59:10,598 --> 01:59:11,859
[SPEAKER_25]: Post that link in the chatroom.

1528
01:59:11,879 --> 01:59:13,020
[SPEAKER_25]: Can you post that link in the chatroom?

1529
01:59:13,040 --> 01:59:13,981
[SPEAKER_25]: Yeah.

1530
01:59:16,798 --> 01:59:23,601
[SPEAKER_25]: Somebody found a picture on these Bomani-style porn boards of the Orange Lounge characters from Mobomoga just naked.

1531
01:59:24,841 --> 01:59:28,022
[SPEAKER_25]: Seriously, people, get out of the house.

1532
01:59:28,462 --> 01:59:32,284
[SPEAKER_25]: If this is you posting this, this is your homework assignment.

1533
01:59:32,664 --> 01:59:36,465
[SPEAKER_25]: You are to go outdoors and get at least three hours of fresh air this week.

1534
01:59:38,866 --> 01:59:41,287
[SPEAKER_25]: And I want you to touch a real girl.

1535
01:59:42,702 --> 01:59:45,464
[SPEAKER_25]: Make sure you have her permission first, and your mom doesn't count, okay?

1536
01:59:45,824 --> 01:59:48,947
[SPEAKER_25]: I want you to actually go out and touch a real girl.

1537
01:59:48,987 --> 01:59:51,449
[SPEAKER_25]: What is... Jamie, look at this one!

1538
01:59:54,151 --> 01:59:55,692
[SPEAKER_14]: It's the chick from Poppin' Music!

1539
01:59:55,712 --> 01:59:57,634
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh my god, I want to make an icon out of that!

1540
02:00:00,396 --> 02:00:01,196
[SPEAKER_07]: I want a link to that.

1541
02:00:06,521 --> 02:00:08,302
[SPEAKER_05]: I just need some heavy breathing to go along with all this.

1542
02:00:08,905 --> 02:00:14,448
[SPEAKER_25]: Claire O'Neil says that the naked picture of tart and toffee should be our new banner for Orange Lounge.

1543
02:00:14,588 --> 02:00:15,488
[SPEAKER_25]: We could do that.

1544
02:00:15,508 --> 02:00:16,909
[SPEAKER_25]: We do have a site remodeling coming up.

1545
02:00:17,109 --> 02:00:17,789
[SPEAKER_25]: Hey, how about that?

1546
02:00:17,809 --> 02:00:18,930
[SPEAKER_25]: We'll just have that in our banner.

1547
02:00:21,611 --> 02:00:22,632
[SPEAKER_07]: I've seen that picture before.

1548
02:00:22,792 --> 02:00:23,572
[SPEAKER_25]: Forget it, forget it.

1549
02:00:25,173 --> 02:00:25,553
[SPEAKER_25]: I'm done.

1550
02:00:25,773 --> 02:00:28,114
[SPEAKER_25]: I'm not going to talk about pornography anymore on the radio.

1551
02:00:28,154 --> 02:00:29,255
[SPEAKER_25]: This is pointless, people.

1552
02:00:30,756 --> 02:00:32,076
[SPEAKER_05]: For the next five minutes.

1553
02:00:32,356 --> 02:00:34,617
[SPEAKER_25]: Just look at what you missed out on, though, if you're not in the chat room.

1554
02:00:34,637 --> 02:00:36,638
[SPEAKER_25]: Alright, you guys want to know who won the cage match?

1555
02:00:37,439 --> 02:00:37,659
[SPEAKER_25]: No.

1556
02:00:37,679 --> 02:00:37,719
[SPEAKER_25]: No.

1557
02:00:38,746 --> 02:00:39,026
[SPEAKER_25]: No?

1558
02:00:40,107 --> 02:00:40,488
[SPEAKER_25]: Yeah?

1559
02:00:41,108 --> 02:00:42,549
[SPEAKER_25]: Alright, let's hear who won tonight's cage match.

1560
02:00:43,190 --> 02:00:52,578
[SPEAKER_25]: The winner of tonight's cage match is... Freeze Pop!

1561
02:00:52,658 --> 02:00:55,641
[SPEAKER_14]: Yay, we get to kill Loki!

1562
02:00:57,322 --> 02:00:58,923
[SPEAKER_25]: Freeze Pop wins tonight.

1563
02:01:02,186 --> 02:01:03,027
[SPEAKER_25]: And Loki's mad at me.

1564
02:01:03,047 --> 02:01:05,329
[SPEAKER_25]: Alright.

1565
02:01:05,349 --> 02:01:05,529
[SPEAKER_25]: Alright.

1566
02:01:06,417 --> 02:01:08,279
[SPEAKER_25]: Let's go to a break, shall we, boys and girls?

1567
02:01:08,299 --> 02:01:12,945
[SPEAKER_25]: We're going to go to a break, and in this break we've got to get ourselves some more 2DX music.

1568
02:01:14,324 --> 02:01:23,188
[SPEAKER_25]: from 2DX Red, because the soundtrack, if you didn't hear, we've been talking about this all night, the soundtrack to 2DX Red came out this week, aka 2DX 11th Style, that's what I've been calling it.

1569
02:01:23,488 --> 02:01:26,870
[SPEAKER_25]: I know that's not the real name, and I also don't care, by the way.

1570
02:01:28,310 --> 02:01:31,532
[SPEAKER_25]: So we've been playing some songs from that all night long, so we're going to keep that up.

1571
02:01:32,392 --> 02:01:35,534
[SPEAKER_25]: I think what we will play in this break, what are we going to do?

1572
02:01:36,034 --> 02:01:36,134
[SPEAKER_25]: Um...

1573
02:01:38,803 --> 02:01:43,585
[SPEAKER_25]: I want to play, actually, there's a really good song by Soda Fujimori that I want to play.

1574
02:01:43,845 --> 02:01:45,746
[SPEAKER_25]: I like that song, so we're going to start it off with that.

1575
02:01:46,086 --> 02:01:48,627
[SPEAKER_25]: It's called The Hope of Tomorrow, so we're going to start it off with that.

1576
02:01:49,047 --> 02:01:51,368
[SPEAKER_25]: Maybe we'll do some DJ Simon in this break as well.

1577
02:01:52,108 --> 02:01:55,930
[SPEAKER_25]: Did we do Don't Be Afraid Myself yet?

1578
02:01:57,790 --> 02:02:00,572
[SPEAKER_25]: I don't think we did, so we have to do Don't Be Afraid Myself because I like that song.

1579
02:02:00,952 --> 02:02:01,872
[SPEAKER_25]: More Freeze Pop.

1580
02:02:02,452 --> 02:02:03,833
[SPEAKER_25]: No, no more Freeze Pop tonight.

1581
02:02:04,293 --> 02:02:06,834
[SPEAKER_25]: And I guess, should we do the Politary one?

1582
02:02:08,652 --> 02:02:09,874
[SPEAKER_25]: Why not?

1583
02:02:10,254 --> 02:02:11,496
[SPEAKER_25]: I'm feeling risky tonight.

1584
02:02:11,516 --> 02:02:12,898
[SPEAKER_25]: We're going to do... It's not Naoki.

1585
02:02:13,218 --> 02:02:15,441
[SPEAKER_25]: It's June featuring Paula Terry.

1586
02:02:15,461 --> 02:02:16,662
[SPEAKER_25]: So have a little hope.

1587
02:02:17,123 --> 02:02:17,964
[SPEAKER_25]: We're going to see how that is.

1588
02:02:18,024 --> 02:02:18,565
[SPEAKER_25]: Raspberry Heart.

1589
02:02:18,585 --> 02:02:21,449
[SPEAKER_25]: Alright, we're going to play all those songs and we'll be back after this.

1590
02:03:37,397 --> 02:03:38,021
Thanks for watching!

1591
02:07:41,024 --> 02:07:43,052
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you for watching!

1592
02:08:16,013 --> 02:08:16,736
[SPEAKER_14]: Thanks for watching!

1593
02:09:02,250 --> 02:09:02,590
Yeah!

1594
02:09:02,690 --> 02:09:03,891
C'mon, let's go!

1595
02:09:03,971 --> 02:09:08,734
You say you're a gift from my heart, but I may be too short and I've got to begin.

1596
02:09:08,774 --> 02:09:11,415
Sometimes it's tough, a little bit lonely or lonely.

1597
02:09:11,515 --> 02:09:13,316
I'm not a game of chess, but you're my heart.

1598
02:09:13,336 --> 02:09:16,478
You're only what you give, and that's what I should learn.

1599
02:09:16,538 --> 02:09:18,960
You know what to do for you, my mystery heart.

1600
02:09:37,173 --> 02:09:42,300
I wanted to be the one to keep up with you Why I can't stop with being left behind

1601
02:10:09,333 --> 02:10:11,175
Gaming Radio, so uncensored.

1602
02:10:35,792 --> 02:10:40,300
[SPEAKER_04]: and even Tom Brokaw could get a job with us.

1603
02:10:40,480 --> 02:10:41,762
[SPEAKER_04]: Orange Lounge Radio.

1604
02:10:47,574 --> 02:10:48,014
[SPEAKER_25]: We're back.

1605
02:10:48,395 --> 02:10:48,875
[SPEAKER_25]: Sorry about that.

1606
02:10:48,895 --> 02:10:50,636
[SPEAKER_25]: That last song got cut off a little bit.

1607
02:10:50,716 --> 02:10:53,178
[SPEAKER_25]: I'm sure none of you guys minded that much because it was Politary.

1608
02:10:53,858 --> 02:10:54,259
[SPEAKER_25]: I'm kidding.

1609
02:10:54,439 --> 02:11:04,365
[SPEAKER_25]: But apparently one of my macros in IRC happens to control my Winamp, and that is why I'm not going to install more of these crappy scripts into my MRC anymore.

1610
02:11:04,446 --> 02:11:06,307
[SPEAKER_25]: So apologies for that.

1611
02:11:07,748 --> 02:11:09,989
[SPEAKER_25]: But at least you got a little taste there of Politary.

1612
02:11:11,050 --> 02:11:13,252
[SPEAKER_25]: June featuring Politary with Raspberry Heart.

1613
02:11:13,712 --> 02:11:15,613
[SPEAKER_25]: And I so wasn't ready to come back from break.

1614
02:11:15,693 --> 02:11:16,013
[SPEAKER_25]: Damn it.

1615
02:11:16,154 --> 02:11:16,754
[SPEAKER_25]: Oh, well, that's all right.

1616
02:11:18,640 --> 02:11:22,382
[SPEAKER_25]: What we're going to do now is... Do we have the TV thingy hooked up?

1617
02:11:22,682 --> 02:11:23,662
[SPEAKER_25]: Do you need some time to get that done?

1618
02:11:23,942 --> 02:11:24,663
[SPEAKER_25]: Or is it already hooked up?

1619
02:11:25,283 --> 02:11:26,263
[SPEAKER_25]: For what she's got?

1620
02:11:29,265 --> 02:11:30,846
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I just don't know how to set it up.

1621
02:11:31,686 --> 02:11:32,486
[SPEAKER_03]: That's good, we're good to go.

1622
02:11:33,667 --> 02:11:38,870
[SPEAKER_25]: Alright, Jamie wants to share with us another follow-up to something from last week.

1623
02:11:40,130 --> 02:11:42,511
[SPEAKER_25]: This has been a running thing for like two weeks now.

1624
02:11:43,232 --> 02:11:45,113
[SPEAKER_25]: Well, Jamie, I'll let you set this up for the listeners.

1625
02:11:45,153 --> 02:11:45,793
[SPEAKER_25]: What's going on here?

1626
02:11:47,600 --> 02:11:55,272
[SPEAKER_07]: I brought the Japanese version of Dracula X to Nocturne in the Moonlight that came out over here as Castlevania Symphony of the Night.

1627
02:11:56,033 --> 02:11:56,955
[SPEAKER_07]: I brought the Precursor.

1628
02:11:57,556 --> 02:12:00,761
[SPEAKER_07]: I brought with me Dracula X for the PC Engine Duo.

1629
02:12:01,437 --> 02:12:10,204
[SPEAKER_25]: So this is kind of neat, because she actually had to bring her whole little system here, a Turbo Duo, which is ages old for a game system.

1630
02:12:10,304 --> 02:12:11,845
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like one of the first CD systems.

1631
02:12:12,025 --> 02:12:14,767
[SPEAKER_25]: It's like we're having a classic gaming expo in my house right now.

1632
02:12:14,947 --> 02:12:15,388
[SPEAKER_25]: It's awesome.

1633
02:12:15,408 --> 02:12:17,209
[SPEAKER_07]: This game goes for eBay from anywhere between $150 to $350.

1634
02:12:20,352 --> 02:12:21,833
[SPEAKER_07]: We actually didn't pay for ours.

1635
02:12:21,913 --> 02:12:23,434
[SPEAKER_07]: It was used to pay us back when someone owed us $100.

1636
02:12:23,514 --> 02:12:24,014
[SPEAKER_07]: Yikes!

1637
02:12:24,774 --> 02:12:30,799
[SPEAKER_07]: She picked it up for us in Japan for about $100.

1638
02:12:31,059 --> 02:12:32,400
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

1639
02:12:33,560 --> 02:12:33,881
[SPEAKER_25]: Wow.

1640
02:12:33,981 --> 02:12:34,641
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm turning it on now.

1641
02:12:34,701 --> 02:12:35,882
[SPEAKER_07]: And be watching the webcam.

1642
02:12:36,642 --> 02:12:41,145
[SPEAKER_25]: Okay, so if you want to check out the webcam, go to www.orangelandrita.com.

1643
02:12:41,165 --> 02:12:41,866
[SPEAKER_25]: The webcam's right there.

1644
02:12:42,326 --> 02:12:43,447
[SPEAKER_25]: So look at it, people.

1645
02:12:44,358 --> 02:12:47,879
[SPEAKER_07]: View the old schoolness of the Super CD-ROM 2 system.

1646
02:12:47,899 --> 02:13:01,422
[SPEAKER_25]: Of course, if you're listening to us on like a rebroadcast or something, such as the one that happens on DDR Freak Radio every Friday night, you don't get to participate along with the webcam because it's not going on right now, but at least you get to hear us kind of talk about it.

1647
02:13:01,742 --> 02:13:06,023
[SPEAKER_25]: So now I noticed the boot up screen here for this system you've got.

1648
02:13:06,123 --> 02:13:11,164
[SPEAKER_25]: It says Super CD-ROM 2 system, but it says CD-ROM squared.

1649
02:13:11,184 --> 02:13:12,404
[SPEAKER_25]: What the hell's the 2?

1650
02:13:15,889 --> 02:13:19,652
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's because it's a dual speed CD.

1651
02:13:20,593 --> 02:13:22,834
[SPEAKER_25]: Oh my gosh, it's lightning fast then.

1652
02:13:23,154 --> 02:13:24,395
[SPEAKER_25]: It's a dual speed CD.

1653
02:13:24,475 --> 02:13:25,276
[SPEAKER_25]: It's a Saturn.

1654
02:13:26,697 --> 02:13:28,518
[SPEAKER_25]: Amazing, it's blazing fast.

1655
02:13:29,039 --> 02:13:33,722
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway, I'm going to go ahead and let the whole intro play through because it's in German.

1656
02:13:36,144 --> 02:13:39,406
[SPEAKER_25]: And our listeners want nothing more than to hear German right now, I'm sure.

1657
02:13:40,026 --> 02:13:43,569
[SPEAKER_07]: I might skip through some of it, but I can't hear it.

1658
02:13:45,530 --> 02:13:47,131
[SPEAKER_07]: Remember the old Konami sound?

1659
02:13:47,331 --> 02:13:48,552
[SPEAKER_25]: Up, up, down, down, left, right, left, right.

1660
02:13:48,592 --> 02:13:51,434
[SPEAKER_25]: So what is this part all about here, DarkSakura?

1661
02:14:11,906 --> 02:14:14,227
[SPEAKER_07]: They're sacrificing virgins to bring back Dracula.

1662
02:14:14,648 --> 02:14:15,088
[SPEAKER_25]: Awesome.

1663
02:14:15,148 --> 02:14:17,049
[SPEAKER_16]: There's the virgin.

1664
02:14:17,129 --> 02:14:23,053
[SPEAKER_16]: This is awesome because it's German with Japanese subtitles.

1665
02:14:23,073 --> 02:14:27,016
[SPEAKER_16]: And I hope people are saving these for me, please.

1666
02:14:40,649 --> 02:14:41,950
[SPEAKER_16]: We want you to rule the world.

1667
02:14:41,970 --> 02:14:44,331
[SPEAKER_16]: We are waiting for you, smiling, to overcome the decline.

1668
02:14:44,351 --> 02:14:45,852
[SPEAKER_16]: After 100 years, the evil has risen again.

1669
02:15:06,414 --> 02:15:09,257
[SPEAKER_25]: Uh, clarify something in the chat room because we don't have motion going on right now.

1670
02:15:09,577 --> 02:15:11,299
[SPEAKER_25]: Is there a full motion video on this game?

1671
02:15:11,539 --> 02:15:12,841
[SPEAKER_07]: It's fake motion.

1672
02:15:13,321 --> 02:15:16,044
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, like... Like Ninja Gaiden cinematics.

1673
02:15:16,064 --> 02:15:16,685
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah.

1674
02:15:17,486 --> 02:15:19,848
[SPEAKER_16]: It has some animation.

1675
02:15:19,948 --> 02:15:20,889
[SPEAKER_05]: It's spread over stills.

1676
02:15:20,929 --> 02:15:21,590
[SPEAKER_16]: Dracula!

1677
02:15:29,204 --> 02:15:31,346
[SPEAKER_07]: Why do you feel the need to share this with our listeners?

1678
02:15:31,426 --> 02:15:33,527
[SPEAKER_07]: Is this some kind of culture?

1679
02:15:33,547 --> 02:15:34,348
[SPEAKER_07]: Because they need to be...

1680
02:15:58,149 --> 02:16:08,295
[SPEAKER_07]: Educated in the ways of the old school.

1681
02:16:08,535 --> 02:16:12,637
[SPEAKER_02]: What I love about this game is it has a lot of updated Castlevania themes in it.

1682
02:16:12,818 --> 02:16:13,338
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my god.

1683
02:16:13,798 --> 02:16:15,239
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, updated for that time.

1684
02:16:15,299 --> 02:16:19,381
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'll tell you what, for our chat room, I am willing to mp3 the whole CD for you.

1685
02:16:21,202 --> 02:16:22,683
[SPEAKER_25]: This music really speaks to me.

1686
02:16:22,783 --> 02:16:27,306
[SPEAKER_02]: It sends the message to me that Freepop is an actual music and it sucks!

1687
02:16:28,052 --> 02:16:29,113
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what it says to me.

1688
02:16:35,395 --> 02:16:38,557
[SPEAKER_02]: The way it looks on the webcam, it almost looks like the skeletons are dancing.

1689
02:16:38,597 --> 02:16:40,798
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, thriller all of a sudden.

1690
02:16:40,858 --> 02:16:41,658
[SPEAKER_02]: Shaun of the Dead.

1691
02:16:56,684 --> 02:16:59,565
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, so I'll play a little bit of it.

1692
02:16:59,845 --> 02:17:02,065
[SPEAKER_07]: But you have to hear, though, Maria.

1693
02:17:02,085 --> 02:17:04,305
[SPEAKER_07]: Because Maria is a playable character in this.

1694
02:17:04,985 --> 02:17:07,506
[SPEAKER_07]: And she's a cheesy little girl in a pink dress.

1695
02:17:08,666 --> 02:17:09,406
[SPEAKER_07]: That throws birds.

1696
02:17:09,606 --> 02:17:10,766
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, what the hell is that?

1697
02:17:11,066 --> 02:17:15,887
[SPEAKER_25]: That's, you know, maybe I'm just out of touch with the whole Castlevania slash Dracula series.

1698
02:17:16,227 --> 02:17:18,588
[SPEAKER_25]: But what the hell is up with the throwing birds?

1699
02:17:19,648 --> 02:17:22,288
[SPEAKER_25]: All the characters always had a whip or like a knife or something.

1700
02:17:22,308 --> 02:17:26,069
[SPEAKER_07]: Richter gets the whole manly ending where he's marching out of the castle triumphant.

1701
02:17:26,539 --> 02:17:31,802
[SPEAKER_07]: and Maria has one where she's being followed by her little animal friends skipping while there's happy music playing.

1702
02:17:31,882 --> 02:17:33,003
[SPEAKER_25]: Jamie, stop making the grudge noise.

1703
02:17:34,444 --> 02:17:36,465
[SPEAKER_07]: And also, this should sound familiar, though.

1704
02:17:37,506 --> 02:17:41,048
[SPEAKER_25]: I always love that satanic church music that Castlevania games have.

1705
02:17:41,368 --> 02:17:50,714
[SPEAKER_07]: See, for anyone who's ever played this on the Super Nintendo, it gives you a hint, but this is... You can tell that Symphony of the Night is definitely a sequel to this game.

1706
02:17:50,734 --> 02:17:55,477
[SPEAKER_25]: You know, this would be good music to play, like, say, I don't know, before a certain wedding.

1707
02:17:56,861 --> 02:17:57,542
[SPEAKER_12]: in a church.

1708
02:17:57,562 --> 02:17:58,543
[SPEAKER_07]: Dude, that would be great.

1709
02:17:58,643 --> 02:18:00,064
[SPEAKER_07]: I should play that before my wedding.

1710
02:18:01,745 --> 02:18:03,367
[SPEAKER_07]: So let's see, do we want Maria?

1711
02:18:03,387 --> 02:18:05,489
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes, sir!

1712
02:18:06,049 --> 02:18:06,770
[SPEAKER_07]: Or do we want Richter?

1713
02:18:06,890 --> 02:18:09,232
[SPEAKER_15]: That's good for Richter.

1714
02:18:09,252 --> 02:18:10,793
[SPEAKER_25]: Maria sounded like Chun-Li there.

1715
02:18:11,253 --> 02:18:12,114
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, sir!

1716
02:18:12,174 --> 02:18:13,555
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, she did go, yes, sir.

1717
02:18:13,696 --> 02:18:14,756
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright.

1718
02:18:17,219 --> 02:18:19,280
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll go ahead and start with whatever the hell this difficult level is.

1719
02:18:20,581 --> 02:18:22,143
[SPEAKER_07]: I know, I should start with the very beginning.

1720
02:18:22,163 --> 02:18:22,363
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

1721
02:18:30,656 --> 02:18:32,177
[SPEAKER_25]: I'm being soothed by the music.

1722
02:18:32,418 --> 02:18:32,978
[SPEAKER_25]: Hey, run away.

1723
02:18:34,399 --> 02:18:35,240
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not soothed.

1724
02:18:36,261 --> 02:18:36,781
[SPEAKER_02]: Soothe me.

1725
02:18:39,203 --> 02:18:39,443
[SPEAKER_25]: Okay.

1726
02:18:40,664 --> 02:18:41,705
[SPEAKER_25]: Jamie's playing for a little bit here.

1727
02:18:46,709 --> 02:18:48,010
[SPEAKER_07]: And then they ate the minstrels.

1728
02:18:48,030 --> 02:18:49,131
[SPEAKER_07]: I get to fight death now.

1729
02:18:52,153 --> 02:18:53,574
[SPEAKER_25]: Truckwagon!

1730
02:18:56,356 --> 02:19:01,400
[SPEAKER_25]: So, in the game right now, Jamie is riding on a horseback and carriage or something.

1731
02:19:01,961 --> 02:19:06,545
[SPEAKER_07]: The graphic, by the way, should look familiar at the beginning of Symphony of the Night.

1732
02:19:11,569 --> 02:19:15,892
[SPEAKER_25]: And Van Helsing completely ripped his bean off.

1733
02:19:16,472 --> 02:19:16,893
[SPEAKER_25]: I might add.

1734
02:19:18,908 --> 02:19:28,712
[SPEAKER_25]: For people that said that Van Helsing was Castlevania the movie, screw you, because honestly, Van Helsing sucked, and a Castlevania movie would be awesome.

1735
02:19:28,912 --> 02:19:31,573
[SPEAKER_25]: They would not do that to a Castlevania movie.

1736
02:19:31,633 --> 02:19:32,793
[SPEAKER_25]: Actually, they would, that's the problem.

1737
02:19:34,194 --> 02:19:38,736
[SPEAKER_25]: There were no flying vampire babies in Castlevania, as far as I'm aware.

1738
02:19:38,936 --> 02:19:44,178
[SPEAKER_25]: Now, there were the flying monkeys, but the... Oh, the music is so good.

1739
02:19:44,198 --> 02:19:47,039
[SPEAKER_07]: I also want people to pay attention if they happen to make it to the camp.

1740
02:19:47,506 --> 02:19:52,030
[SPEAKER_07]: The opening graphic, you'll remember, is exactly the same as it was on Symphony of the Night.

1741
02:19:53,411 --> 02:19:57,955
[SPEAKER_25]: Which is funny, because the opening graphic has a little upside-down blue triangle when you play as Richter.

1742
02:19:58,476 --> 02:20:01,398
[SPEAKER_25]: But when you play as Maria, it's an upside-down pink triangle.

1743
02:20:02,079 --> 02:20:07,764
[SPEAKER_25]: And for you fellow family, aka homos out there, you know what an upside-down pink triangle means.

1744
02:20:14,446 --> 02:20:17,788
[SPEAKER_25]: I think I did play something very similar to this on Super Nintendo.

1745
02:20:17,808 --> 02:20:22,772
[SPEAKER_07]: Also, Richter should look very familiar to everybody because it's exactly the same sprite used in Symphony of the Night.

1746
02:20:22,832 --> 02:20:23,112
[SPEAKER_25]: It is.

1747
02:20:23,292 --> 02:20:23,812
[SPEAKER_25]: It seriously is.

1748
02:20:23,832 --> 02:20:26,974
[SPEAKER_07]: They actually changed the sprite for the Saturn version to look like his portrait.

1749
02:20:27,555 --> 02:20:27,815
[SPEAKER_25]: Huh.

1750
02:20:32,778 --> 02:20:33,178
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what?

1751
02:20:33,218 --> 02:20:38,662
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm thinking to make this whole thing complete, next week you need to bring the Saturn and Nocturne and the Moonlight.

1752
02:20:38,942 --> 02:20:40,503
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll do it.

1753
02:20:43,155 --> 02:20:43,895
[SPEAKER_24]: I have a Saturn.

1754
02:20:43,995 --> 02:20:45,016
[SPEAKER_24]: I have a few Saturns, actually.

1755
02:20:45,036 --> 02:20:46,897
[SPEAKER_07]: I may have a completed save file on that one.

1756
02:20:48,037 --> 02:20:48,397
[SPEAKER_02]: Awesome.

1757
02:20:50,498 --> 02:21:01,622
[SPEAKER_25]: Now what I love about this part of the game, too, is it looks like she's actually going through the old town in Castle... Oh, and Jamie's saying it is the old town from Castlevania II, Simon's Quest.

1758
02:21:01,922 --> 02:21:07,945
[SPEAKER_25]: So for those of you guys that are looking on the webcam right now, you're like, damn, it looks like the same graphics they had in Simon's Quest.

1759
02:21:08,025 --> 02:21:08,725
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it is.

1760
02:21:19,298 --> 02:21:21,799
[SPEAKER_25]: It just sounds like a bunch of broken glass everywhere right now.

1761
02:21:21,819 --> 02:21:23,720
[SPEAKER_25]: Whoa, hey, what was that?

1762
02:21:24,840 --> 02:21:30,322
[SPEAKER_25]: As I mentioned before when we were watching her play this earlier, it sounds like the same sound effects from Mega Man.

1763
02:21:32,063 --> 02:21:33,584
[SPEAKER_25]: But they're two different companies!

1764
02:21:33,684 --> 02:21:36,505
[SPEAKER_25]: Mega Man is Capcom, Castlevania is Konami.

1765
02:21:36,545 --> 02:21:37,685
[SPEAKER_25]: How the hell do you figure?

1766
02:21:37,705 --> 02:21:45,869
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a hidden place that I can't get to with Richter.

1767
02:21:46,529 --> 02:21:46,789
[SPEAKER_12]: Don't.

1768
02:21:51,423 --> 02:21:56,466
[SPEAKER_25]: Anyway, Loki, Castlevania is Konami, Mega Man is Capcom.

1769
02:21:56,526 --> 02:21:57,966
[SPEAKER_25]: They cannot share the sound effects.

1770
02:21:59,107 --> 02:22:00,168
[SPEAKER_25]: The world would explode.

1771
02:22:03,729 --> 02:22:04,930
[SPEAKER_02]: What the hell was that?

1772
02:22:05,550 --> 02:22:06,291
[SPEAKER_02]: That was dinner.

1773
02:22:09,192 --> 02:22:10,493
[SPEAKER_02]: Jamie says it was the gargoyle.

1774
02:22:14,095 --> 02:22:16,476
[SPEAKER_02]: See, it's almost like being at somebody's house.

1775
02:22:17,139 --> 02:22:23,282
[SPEAKER_25]: watching them play games, except in this case you have your back turned and you only get to look once every 30 seconds.

1776
02:22:28,725 --> 02:22:30,006
[SPEAKER_05]: You just got to wonder what you're missing.

1777
02:22:30,126 --> 02:22:31,047
[SPEAKER_25]: Oh, what happened?

1778
02:22:31,067 --> 02:22:31,647
[SPEAKER_25]: The music stopped.

1779
02:22:32,227 --> 02:22:32,928
[SPEAKER_25]: Oh, load time.

1780
02:22:34,989 --> 02:22:36,029
[SPEAKER_25]: Make your own music.

1781
02:22:36,169 --> 02:22:36,910
[SPEAKER_25]: Oh, here we go.

1782
02:22:38,371 --> 02:22:39,551
[SPEAKER_25]: Are you fighting the boss right now?

1783
02:22:42,373 --> 02:22:44,214
[SPEAKER_25]: Yeah, you died last time you fought this boss.

1784
02:22:47,455 --> 02:22:48,535
[SPEAKER_25]: This sounds 8-bit.

1785
02:22:48,615 --> 02:22:49,356
[SPEAKER_25]: This song sounds 8-bit.

1786
02:22:49,476 --> 02:22:51,356
[SPEAKER_25]: Oh.

1787
02:22:52,257 --> 02:22:52,837
[SPEAKER_03]: Excuse me.

1788
02:22:58,239 --> 02:22:59,099
[SPEAKER_03]: Excuse me again.

1789
02:22:59,119 --> 02:23:01,780
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know what I ate.

1790
02:23:09,423 --> 02:23:10,703
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki, stop that.

1791
02:23:12,684 --> 02:23:12,884
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

1792
02:23:21,354 --> 02:23:22,134
[SPEAKER_02]: Jamie died.

1793
02:23:22,314 --> 02:23:23,675
[SPEAKER_02]: No, she's not dead yet.

1794
02:23:25,136 --> 02:23:29,298
[SPEAKER_12]: Now she's... Did you hear that sound?

1795
02:23:29,478 --> 02:23:32,400
[SPEAKER_25]: I swear to God that was the sound it made when you died in like Zelda.

1796
02:23:37,423 --> 02:23:38,644
[SPEAKER_25]: You need the axe for this.

1797
02:23:38,784 --> 02:23:42,146
[SPEAKER_25]: You always needed the axe for the first boss in any Castlevania game.

1798
02:23:42,186 --> 02:23:42,686
[SPEAKER_25]: What's up with that?

1799
02:23:45,928 --> 02:23:46,228
[SPEAKER_25]: Alright.

1800
02:23:50,208 --> 02:23:50,448
[SPEAKER_25]: What?

1801
02:23:50,468 --> 02:23:57,310
[SPEAKER_25]: Alright, Jamie's just trying to get to the next level so you can hear the music, because it is really awesome.

1802
02:23:58,891 --> 02:24:00,831
[SPEAKER_25]: And then after that, we're going to go into the FUs of the week.

1803
02:24:01,151 --> 02:24:05,573
[SPEAKER_25]: So you guys, by the way, if you're in our chatroom right now, you can send those FUs of the week.

1804
02:24:05,893 --> 02:24:09,054
[SPEAKER_25]: Just send a private message to Sky in the chatroom with your FU.

1805
02:24:23,547 --> 02:24:24,147
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you kill it?

1806
02:24:24,808 --> 02:24:25,348
[SPEAKER_02]: She killed it.

1807
02:24:25,388 --> 02:24:26,149
[SPEAKER_02]: Yay!

1808
02:24:26,209 --> 02:24:29,391
[SPEAKER_07]: Here we get the disco ball.

1809
02:24:30,331 --> 02:24:31,412
[SPEAKER_25]: What's up with the disco ball?

1810
02:24:31,472 --> 02:24:34,274
[SPEAKER_25]: Like, the crystal that drops from the ceiling is like a little disco ball.

1811
02:24:34,314 --> 02:24:34,754
[SPEAKER_25]: It's crazy.

1812
02:24:36,976 --> 02:24:37,716
[SPEAKER_25]: Makes you want to dance.

1813
02:24:39,437 --> 02:24:40,198
[SPEAKER_25]: Ooh, it's sparkling.

1814
02:24:41,138 --> 02:24:42,499
[SPEAKER_25]: It's a sparkling disco ball.

1815
02:24:43,900 --> 02:24:45,961
[SPEAKER_07]: And as you can see, it's a red ball with fire in it.

1816
02:24:47,362 --> 02:24:49,984
[SPEAKER_25]: Well, the cam hasn't updated yet, so I can't see it, but... Sorry.

1817
02:24:50,304 --> 02:24:50,785
[SPEAKER_07]: That's all right.

1818
02:24:53,320 --> 02:24:54,021
[SPEAKER_25]: I know that noise.

1819
02:24:55,162 --> 02:24:59,505
[SPEAKER_07]: Believe it or not, I actually like the first level music better on the Super Nintendo version, but all the rest of it's better.

1820
02:25:03,088 --> 02:25:05,029
[SPEAKER_25]: Alright, now you have to hear the music at the beginning of the stage.

1821
02:25:05,069 --> 02:25:07,031
[SPEAKER_25]: It's the whole reason we played this whole first stage.

1822
02:25:08,552 --> 02:25:10,193
[SPEAKER_07]: I forgot I also have sound test open.

1823
02:25:17,018 --> 02:25:17,719
[SPEAKER_03]: Sound familiar?

1824
02:25:23,644 --> 02:25:26,365
[SPEAKER_25]: Yeah, it's the old school song from like Castlevania 1.

1825
02:25:26,685 --> 02:25:27,525
[SPEAKER_25]: It's the first stage.

1826
02:25:27,825 --> 02:25:39,728
[SPEAKER_02]: Awesome.

1827
02:25:39,808 --> 02:25:42,749
[SPEAKER_02]: It was funny the way the bird squawked right at the pause in the song.

1828
02:25:49,111 --> 02:25:49,491
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright.

1829
02:25:50,711 --> 02:25:52,792
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, we're going to wrap it up for this segment.

1830
02:25:54,557 --> 02:25:55,217
[SPEAKER_25]: Wait, wait, what?

1831
02:25:55,317 --> 02:25:55,737
[SPEAKER_25]: One more thing?

1832
02:25:56,657 --> 02:25:56,897
[SPEAKER_25]: Oh, okay.

1833
02:25:57,438 --> 02:26:00,558
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, I'm gonna actually play a song that I want to be in my effing music.

1834
02:26:00,578 --> 02:26:02,359
[SPEAKER_25]: Okay.

1835
02:26:02,379 --> 02:26:02,959
[SPEAKER_07]: Just for this once.

1836
02:26:03,299 --> 02:26:04,179
[SPEAKER_25]: Okay, just for this once.

1837
02:26:04,219 --> 02:26:05,119
[SPEAKER_07]: But I have to get to it, so.

1838
02:26:05,459 --> 02:26:05,879
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright.

1839
02:26:06,079 --> 02:26:08,420
[SPEAKER_25]: Well, I'm gonna turn down the volume until you get to that part.

1840
02:26:09,020 --> 02:26:09,440
[SPEAKER_25]: Well, great.

1841
02:26:09,460 --> 02:26:11,000
[SPEAKER_25]: What are we supposed to talk about in the meantime?

1842
02:26:11,040 --> 02:26:11,680
[SPEAKER_25]: I have no idea.

1843
02:26:12,461 --> 02:26:12,681
[SPEAKER_25]: Eesh.

1844
02:26:14,361 --> 02:26:15,241
[SPEAKER_25]: Now what are we supposed to do?

1845
02:26:15,261 --> 02:26:17,222
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, I'm just getting to the sound test.

1846
02:26:17,722 --> 02:26:18,102
[SPEAKER_25]: Oh, okay.

1847
02:26:18,822 --> 02:26:20,362
[SPEAKER_25]: Well, that won't take that long.

1848
02:26:20,502 --> 02:26:20,622
[SPEAKER_07]: No.

1849
02:26:22,483 --> 02:26:24,243
[SPEAKER_07]: Just because this is my favorite piece of music in the game.

1850
02:26:25,171 --> 02:26:26,552
[SPEAKER_07]: And I forgot the sound test existed.

1851
02:26:26,732 --> 02:26:30,775
[SPEAKER_25]: I guess what I'll do for a minute here while I queue up the FUs of the week, which, by the way, you guys should be sitting in.

1852
02:26:31,435 --> 02:26:33,276
[SPEAKER_25]: I'll take a moment to plug our spinoff shows.

1853
02:26:33,817 --> 02:26:38,240
[SPEAKER_25]: Monday night on Orange Lounge Radio, Diversion, the Orange Lounge Radio remix show.

1854
02:26:38,420 --> 02:26:40,321
[SPEAKER_25]: A bunch of your favorite remixes.

1855
02:26:40,821 --> 02:26:42,442
[SPEAKER_25]: Not only just... I can hear your computer, buddy.

1856
02:26:43,923 --> 02:26:46,705
[SPEAKER_25]: Loki, your computer's coming out the... It is.

1857
02:26:47,125 --> 02:26:47,466
[SPEAKER_25]: I hear it.

1858
02:26:48,406 --> 02:26:49,147
[SPEAKER_25]: And so do our listeners.

1859
02:26:50,808 --> 02:26:51,168
[SPEAKER_25]: Whatever you...

1860
02:26:53,658 --> 02:26:55,539
[SPEAKER_25]: Whatever you're working on there, I just heard in my speaker.

1861
02:26:58,881 --> 02:27:01,463
[SPEAKER_25]: Listeners, tell Loki you can hear it.

1862
02:27:07,147 --> 02:27:08,007
[SPEAKER_25]: Try it again, try it again.

1863
02:27:10,669 --> 02:27:11,289
[SPEAKER_25]: I don't hear it now.

1864
02:27:11,890 --> 02:27:12,230
[SPEAKER_25]: I hear it.

1865
02:27:13,271 --> 02:27:14,591
[SPEAKER_25]: Oh, no, that was the TV right there.

1866
02:27:14,611 --> 02:27:14,972
[SPEAKER_25]: Okay.

1867
02:27:15,152 --> 02:27:15,352
[SPEAKER_24]: Okay.

1868
02:27:17,093 --> 02:27:18,935
[SPEAKER_25]: But I'm telling you, I heard whatever this thing was.

1869
02:27:19,535 --> 02:27:22,017
[SPEAKER_25]: It's a, it's a, you're doing a, I can tell what it is.

1870
02:27:22,257 --> 02:27:22,517
[SPEAKER_25]: Anyway.

1871
02:27:22,858 --> 02:27:23,218
[SPEAKER_25]: Found it.

1872
02:27:23,598 --> 02:27:24,259
[SPEAKER_25]: You guys don't care.

1873
02:27:24,499 --> 02:27:24,739
[SPEAKER_25]: Anyway.

1874
02:27:25,460 --> 02:27:26,621
[SPEAKER_25]: Not yet, not yet, not yet.

1875
02:27:27,521 --> 02:27:27,942
[SPEAKER_25]: Keep it down.

1876
02:27:28,522 --> 02:27:28,763
[SPEAKER_25]: God.

1877
02:27:29,843 --> 02:27:31,525
[SPEAKER_25]: We're going to get into the FUs of the week.

1878
02:27:33,666 --> 02:27:38,130
[SPEAKER_25]: Oh yeah, before I, I need to keep finishing up our spin-off programming.

1879
02:27:39,231 --> 02:27:39,771
[SPEAKER_07]: I found music.

1880
02:27:40,072 --> 02:27:40,332
[SPEAKER_25]: All right.

1881
02:27:40,663 --> 02:27:42,543
[SPEAKER_25]: Tuesday night, pump up the volume, 7 o'clock.

1882
02:27:43,024 --> 02:27:43,284
[SPEAKER_25]: Or what?

1883
02:27:43,304 --> 02:27:45,764
[SPEAKER_25]: It says 7.30 for show, but 6.45-ish for pre-show.

1884
02:27:45,864 --> 02:27:47,525
[SPEAKER_25]: Thursday night, outside the box, 7 o'clock.

1885
02:27:47,545 --> 02:27:49,085
[SPEAKER_25]: When we feel like doing a show, we do one.

1886
02:27:49,445 --> 02:27:52,826
[SPEAKER_25]: Alright, now we can do... Jamie, why do we have to do the FUs of the week every week?

1887
02:27:52,926 --> 02:27:55,527
[SPEAKER_07]: Because we're angry, but this music is too happy to be angry about.

1888
02:27:56,987 --> 02:27:57,207
[SPEAKER_07]: Ready?

1889
02:28:07,990 --> 02:28:08,090
[SPEAKER_07]: Um...

1890
02:28:09,048 --> 02:28:11,430
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm angry about the woman with the cookies.

1891
02:28:12,110 --> 02:28:14,112
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, this is the only thing I'm really angry about.

1892
02:28:17,234 --> 02:28:26,282
[SPEAKER_07]: There was this, these couple of teenage girls, and I'll be posting a link in the chat room soon, but they went around their neighborhood passing out cookies and they were leaving them on doorsteps with surprises.

1893
02:28:26,382 --> 02:28:34,268
[SPEAKER_07]: This one woman sued them for causing her anxiety because they knocked on the door, she didn't answer, and so they left them and ran as a surprise.

1894
02:28:35,689 --> 02:28:41,751
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, they offered to pay her medical damages because she did apparently get checked into the hospital for nearly having a heart attack or something.

1895
02:28:42,772 --> 02:28:48,294
[SPEAKER_07]: And, uh, instead, uh, she sued them for the punitive damages.

1896
02:28:48,334 --> 02:28:52,175
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, she didn't win that, but she did win what the girls offered her anyway.

1897
02:28:52,535 --> 02:28:55,036
[SPEAKER_07]: So, it's a big mess.

1898
02:28:55,056 --> 02:28:56,557
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to post a link to that in my live journal.

1899
02:28:56,677 --> 02:29:02,559
[SPEAKER_07]: Also, a big F-you to all of you school children who do not believe in the goddamn First Amendment.

1900
02:29:04,629 --> 02:29:12,853
[SPEAKER_07]: There was a survey done that stated something like 80% of students, I think, should believe the government has control over our public media.

1901
02:29:13,613 --> 02:29:15,374
[SPEAKER_07]: That's in direct violation of the First Amendment.

1902
02:29:15,694 --> 02:29:17,915
[SPEAKER_07]: They also don't know how to properly dispose of the flag, either.

1903
02:29:17,935 --> 02:29:21,276
[SPEAKER_07]: They think that flag burning is illegal.

1904
02:29:22,016 --> 02:29:23,117
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that that's really stupid.

1905
02:29:23,937 --> 02:29:27,418
[SPEAKER_07]: Just a big F you to general ignorance of damn near everybody.

1906
02:29:27,679 --> 02:29:28,599
[SPEAKER_07]: And I blame their parents.

1907
02:29:29,519 --> 02:29:29,839
[SPEAKER_07]: That's it.

1908
02:29:32,561 --> 02:29:33,301
[SPEAKER_25]: Loki's turn.

1909
02:29:37,250 --> 02:29:44,315
[SPEAKER_25]: Fuck you this cold, because I've had a sore throat for like an entire week, and that's really the only symptom that I have from that and being congested.

1910
02:29:44,915 --> 02:29:52,461
[SPEAKER_25]: So, that kind of sucks, because talking on the phone all day at work, it just irritates it, and that's no picnic.

1911
02:29:53,602 --> 02:29:58,065
[SPEAKER_25]: And then, fuck you to stupid, um, lame-ass people with cell phones.

1912
02:29:58,525 --> 02:29:59,786
[SPEAKER_25]: God damn it, I want...

1913
02:30:00,501 --> 02:30:02,783
[SPEAKER_25]: A law to be passed where people cannot drive with cell phones.

1914
02:30:02,843 --> 02:30:10,308
[SPEAKER_25]: In fact, there was a fucking study done that people are more dangerous driving with cell phones than they would be intoxicated.

1915
02:30:10,328 --> 02:30:11,169
[SPEAKER_07]: They're making it illegal.

1916
02:30:11,869 --> 02:30:12,550
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank God!

1917
02:30:12,730 --> 02:30:13,391
[SPEAKER_02]: Because you know what?

1918
02:30:13,451 --> 02:30:14,772
[SPEAKER_02]: People can't fucking do it.

1919
02:30:16,653 --> 02:30:18,514
[SPEAKER_07]: I've been in a car with you talking on your cell phone.

1920
02:30:18,674 --> 02:30:19,595
[SPEAKER_02]: I just use speakerphone.

1921
02:30:21,076 --> 02:30:21,557
[SPEAKER_24]: Doesn't matter.

1922
02:30:21,717 --> 02:30:26,140
[SPEAKER_25]: Even with speakerphone, the reaction time is much worse.

1923
02:30:26,200 --> 02:30:28,782
[SPEAKER_07]: The impending law, though, is supposed to make provisions for hands-free driving.

1924
02:30:30,100 --> 02:30:30,801
[SPEAKER_25]: So, you know what?

1925
02:30:31,361 --> 02:30:35,925
[SPEAKER_25]: So that goes for all you women out there driving those SUVs and with those stupid cell phones.

1926
02:30:36,105 --> 02:30:36,425
[SPEAKER_25]: Ha!

1927
02:30:36,686 --> 02:30:37,967
[SPEAKER_25]: You can't do it any longer.

1928
02:30:39,428 --> 02:30:40,329
[SPEAKER_25]: To hell with you people.

1929
02:30:40,789 --> 02:30:41,109
[SPEAKER_25]: Anyways.

1930
02:30:42,330 --> 02:30:45,733
[SPEAKER_25]: Then also, um, fuck you, the goddamn Indian casinos.

1931
02:30:46,334 --> 02:30:46,634
[SPEAKER_25]: Actually...

1932
02:30:47,153 --> 02:31:11,836
[SPEAKER_25]: because, you know, I think it's quite funny that people go there and spend all their money, oh, look at this, this is nice, because they have, you know, all this, we can go gamble and stuff, but guess what, you don't win, they're just doing a reverse rapage on you, okay, they're just going to rape you of your money, because we raped them of their land, so, you know, I don't feel sorry for anyone that goes there and loses all their money, so to hell with them, and, um,

1933
02:31:13,665 --> 02:31:14,286
[SPEAKER_25]: That'll be it.

1934
02:31:14,326 --> 02:31:14,807
[SPEAKER_25]: My turn.

1935
02:31:31,975 --> 02:31:48,866
[SPEAKER_25]: My first FU goes to Loki for having two FUs that were involving me somehow in some way, because A, I love talking on my cell phone while I drive, and I do it just fine, and B, I lost $75 at the casino last night, but I don't care, I had fun, and I won $100 the last time I was there.

1936
02:31:49,206 --> 02:31:56,091
[SPEAKER_25]: But on that note, FU to the fact that I was not able to keep up my winning streak last night, that made me sad, but oh well.

1937
02:31:56,331 --> 02:32:01,274
[SPEAKER_25]: I had fun while it lasted, even though it didn't last very long, but then again, neither do orgasms.

1938
02:32:01,958 --> 02:32:05,499
[SPEAKER_25]: Um, what else would I give an F you to?

1939
02:32:06,059 --> 02:32:10,000
[SPEAKER_25]: An F you to just, like, hangovers, that's a big one.

1940
02:32:10,540 --> 02:32:19,502
[SPEAKER_25]: An F you to drama in general, because there's just drama sometimes, and it makes things messy, and that's all I can say about that, really.

1941
02:32:21,383 --> 02:32:21,963
[SPEAKER_25]: Let's move on.

1942
02:32:22,723 --> 02:32:25,544
[SPEAKER_25]: Let's talk to some of the other folks that are here in studio.

1943
02:32:25,684 --> 02:32:25,884
[SPEAKER_25]: Angel.

1944
02:32:27,759 --> 02:32:33,762
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, F you to my instructor because I'm saying I did something that I didn't do.

1945
02:32:34,583 --> 02:32:36,004
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's all that needs to be said about that.

1946
02:32:37,084 --> 02:32:40,086
[SPEAKER_08]: F you to myself for not giving myself enough sleep during the week.

1947
02:32:40,406 --> 02:32:42,907
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that happens to all of us at one point or another.

1948
02:32:45,088 --> 02:32:48,790
[SPEAKER_08]: And other than that, not much because I'm not really that angsty.

1949
02:32:48,870 --> 02:32:51,832
[SPEAKER_08]: But then again, when am I ever that angsty?

1950
02:32:54,153 --> 02:32:56,054
[SPEAKER_25]: You've been like borderline angsty, I've seen.

1951
02:32:57,035 --> 02:32:57,335
[SPEAKER_25]: Alright.

1952
02:32:58,791 --> 02:32:59,572
[SPEAKER_25]: Uh, Bugged.

1953
02:33:01,032 --> 02:33:03,233
[SPEAKER_05]: Just a nice little FU to Loki about freeze pop.

1954
02:33:05,634 --> 02:33:06,374
[SPEAKER_25]: You dumb mob ass.

1955
02:33:06,394 --> 02:33:08,215
[SPEAKER_25]: He just will not let that drop.

1956
02:33:08,735 --> 02:33:10,976
[SPEAKER_25]: He will not drop the freeze pop grudge.

1957
02:33:12,077 --> 02:33:12,517
[SPEAKER_24]: Oh boy.

1958
02:33:12,837 --> 02:33:14,117
[SPEAKER_05]: No, we're not supposed to drop the mob ass.

1959
02:33:14,157 --> 02:33:15,018
[SPEAKER_05]: Everyone's supposed to say it.

1960
02:33:15,478 --> 02:33:18,539
[SPEAKER_05]: It's gonna be the next... Death Cake.

1961
02:33:20,400 --> 02:33:21,320
What the fuck's Death Cake?

1962
02:33:23,341 --> 02:33:24,082
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that an Eddie Izzard?

1963
02:33:24,742 --> 02:33:25,042
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

1964
02:33:25,908 --> 02:33:33,151
[SPEAKER_07]: We brought up the cake or death with the vicar or die and death cake.

1965
02:33:33,672 --> 02:33:35,012
[SPEAKER_25]: I thought you had a response to that, Loki.

1966
02:33:35,052 --> 02:33:35,773
[SPEAKER_25]: That's why I gave you the mic.

1967
02:33:36,253 --> 02:33:37,033
[SPEAKER_25]: All right, is that it, bugged?

1968
02:33:38,314 --> 02:33:38,514
[SPEAKER_25]: Yeah.

1969
02:33:38,694 --> 02:33:38,934
[SPEAKER_25]: All right.

1970
02:33:39,454 --> 02:33:40,315
[SPEAKER_25]: Chat room time.

1971
02:33:41,215 --> 02:33:42,656
[SPEAKER_25]: Let's see what the folks on chat room have to say.

1972
02:33:42,776 --> 02:33:43,176
[SPEAKER_25]: Yeah, I know.

1973
02:33:43,196 --> 02:33:43,576
[SPEAKER_25]: Who cares?

1974
02:33:44,937 --> 02:33:51,560
[SPEAKER_25]: Illusion says F you to Jamster for just being Jamster and being on every commercial break.

1975
02:33:51,580 --> 02:33:52,720
[SPEAKER_25]: You know who owns Jamster?

1976
02:33:52,820 --> 02:33:53,081
[SPEAKER_25]: Who?

1977
02:33:53,341 --> 02:33:53,941
[SPEAKER_05]: Verisign.

1978
02:33:54,898 --> 02:33:55,739
[SPEAKER_25]: You gotta be kidding.

1979
02:33:55,879 --> 02:33:59,002
[SPEAKER_05]: No, they're a subsidiary of Rare Science.

1980
02:33:59,022 --> 02:33:59,383
[SPEAKER_25]: Jesus.

1981
02:33:59,743 --> 02:34:01,505
[SPEAKER_25]: Okay, here you go, guys.

1982
02:34:01,525 --> 02:34:05,429
[SPEAKER_25]: There's actually a petition on the internet to stop Jamster, and I would urge you all to sign it.

1983
02:34:05,709 --> 02:34:09,293
[SPEAKER_25]: Even though I'm not huge on internet petitions, this is one I can believe in.

1984
02:34:09,793 --> 02:34:11,875
[SPEAKER_25]: I don't care if it has, like, minimal impact.

1985
02:34:11,915 --> 02:34:15,559
[SPEAKER_25]: If we can stop one Jamster commercial from airing, we've done our job.

1986
02:34:17,262 --> 02:34:24,986
[SPEAKER_25]: Illusion also says, an F you to Shakey's, stopping their karaoke right before my friends and I got there so we didn't get to do Love Shack again.

1987
02:34:25,347 --> 02:34:29,169
[SPEAKER_25]: Hey, that's the song that Iguana Girl and I always do, is Love Shack.

1988
02:34:29,309 --> 02:34:30,669
[SPEAKER_25]: We did it on this show once, actually.

1989
02:34:33,831 --> 02:34:34,291
[SPEAKER_25]: K.K.

1990
02:34:34,351 --> 02:34:37,633
[SPEAKER_25]: Slider says, F you to Final Fantasy XI, taking my life.

1991
02:34:39,694 --> 02:34:40,575
[SPEAKER_03]: I sympathize.

1992
02:34:40,635 --> 02:34:41,936
[SPEAKER_25]: What, Jamie, what did you say to K.K.

1993
02:34:41,956 --> 02:34:42,216
[SPEAKER_25]: Slider?

1994
02:34:43,136 --> 02:34:43,396
[SPEAKER_25]: Addict.

1995
02:34:43,436 --> 02:34:44,297
[SPEAKER_25]: Jamie says, Addict.

1996
02:34:46,827 --> 02:34:50,129
[SPEAKER_25]: AZN Buddy Paul says, F you to Heartbreakers.

1997
02:34:50,809 --> 02:34:55,931
[SPEAKER_25]: There have been like two gazillion breakups lately.

1998
02:34:55,991 --> 02:34:57,012
[SPEAKER_25]: Maybe you're just a player.

1999
02:34:58,832 --> 02:35:03,695
[SPEAKER_25]: Sephiroth1215 says, F you to No Service Pack 8 yet.

2000
02:35:04,315 --> 02:35:08,817
[SPEAKER_25]: And no 2DX in America yet, even though I have a feeling it will be soon.

2001
02:35:08,837 --> 02:35:09,797
[SPEAKER_25]: I always say Service Pack.

2002
02:35:10,078 --> 02:35:10,658
[SPEAKER_25]: Song Pack 8.

2003
02:35:12,597 --> 02:35:17,504
[SPEAKER_25]: Sephiroth 1215 also says, and F you for no outside the box once again.

2004
02:35:17,524 --> 02:35:19,166
[SPEAKER_25]: I have more fun on that show.

2005
02:35:19,226 --> 02:35:21,088
[SPEAKER_25]: Well, I'm sure the others are pleased to hear that.

2006
02:35:22,510 --> 02:35:23,211
[SPEAKER_25]: What can I say?

2007
02:35:23,311 --> 02:35:25,034
[SPEAKER_25]: Real life gets in the way sometimes.

2008
02:35:25,514 --> 02:35:25,975
[SPEAKER_25]: We'll see.

2009
02:35:26,656 --> 02:35:27,397
[SPEAKER_25]: We'll see what happens.

2010
02:35:28,007 --> 02:35:31,068
[SPEAKER_25]: Legend of Zaku says, F you to the fact that I'm still unemployed.

2011
02:35:31,648 --> 02:35:36,049
[SPEAKER_25]: F you to wasting away my body by not eating right, thus losing my stamina when playing DDR.

2012
02:35:36,409 --> 02:35:40,689
[SPEAKER_25]: And F you to Valentine's Day coming up next week, and me still not having a valentine.

2013
02:35:43,590 --> 02:35:50,091
[SPEAKER_25]: Jaded2005 says, F you to my computer for acting weird at the worst possible time yesterday while playing Doom 3.

2014
02:35:52,552 --> 02:35:53,772
[SPEAKER_25]: And what time would that be?

2015
02:35:53,912 --> 02:35:54,152
[SPEAKER_25]: Jeez.

2016
02:35:57,219 --> 02:35:58,780
[SPEAKER_25]: I think I had one of those earlier.

2017
02:35:58,840 --> 02:35:59,360
[SPEAKER_25]: Uh, the wet ones.

2018
02:35:59,400 --> 02:36:02,221
[SPEAKER_25]: DarkLionXVI says, One FU for tonight.

2019
02:36:25,187 --> 02:36:31,509
[SPEAKER_25]: FU to EvilNauki2DX for making me spit water on the wall so many times every time he sent me pictures.

2020
02:36:32,830 --> 02:36:34,730
[SPEAKER_05]: Would those be 4chan pictures?

2021
02:36:34,911 --> 02:36:42,393
[SPEAKER_25]: Well, usually I don't read FUs directed at certain people, but that, you know, I can tell that, you know, that's a light-hearted FU, so those are okay.

2022
02:36:43,754 --> 02:36:46,775
[SPEAKER_05]: I know who won the Super Bowl movement, it was the Browns.

2023
02:36:51,496 --> 02:36:51,916
[SPEAKER_25]: You're welcome.

2024
02:36:54,976 --> 02:36:57,717
[SPEAKER_25]: I thought LankyStyle made the worst jokes possible.

2025
02:36:57,737 --> 02:36:58,738
[SPEAKER_05]: Where do you think he learned them from?

2026
02:37:02,040 --> 02:37:07,704
[SPEAKER_25]: TheXJasonXV, Resident Webmaster, and Slaveboy will be his official title with the new business structure.

2027
02:37:08,425 --> 02:37:09,025
[SPEAKER_25]: F you to work.

2028
02:37:09,185 --> 02:37:10,446
[SPEAKER_25]: Constant F you to work.

2029
02:37:10,606 --> 02:37:13,688
[SPEAKER_25]: I don't like all the workload being pushed off on me.

2030
02:37:18,231 --> 02:37:21,814
[SPEAKER_25]: Right Shannon Joyce says, Joyce says F you to the world.

2031
02:37:25,151 --> 02:37:30,693
[SPEAKER_25]: and EvilNauki2DX would like to say one quick FU for Ragnarok Online.

2032
02:37:31,413 --> 02:37:32,474
[SPEAKER_25]: Taking my life away.

2033
02:37:33,774 --> 02:37:34,594
[SPEAKER_05]: Korean knockoff.

2034
02:37:34,914 --> 02:37:38,055
[SPEAKER_14]: It's Ragnarok!

2035
02:37:39,416 --> 02:37:45,838
[SPEAKER_05]: Korean life-sucking game, right?

2036
02:37:45,858 --> 02:37:51,700
[SPEAKER_25]: Yeah, Ragnarok's another one of those life-sucking MMORPGs that you play and you start going, how did I ever get into this in the first place?

2037
02:37:53,078 --> 02:38:05,167
[SPEAKER_25]: I did like Ragnarok though, it was so cute I will play Ragnarok 2 probably and people that know me know that I don't really have a whole lot of time for those other MMORPGs but I will give Ragnarok Online 2 a chance

2038
02:38:07,882 --> 02:38:08,683
[SPEAKER_07]: It was adorable.

2039
02:38:09,503 --> 02:38:09,924
[SPEAKER_25]: It's cute.

2040
02:38:09,944 --> 02:38:15,147
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sorry, I still had that picture for the longest time on my phone of your mage and my assassin.

2041
02:38:15,348 --> 02:38:23,013
[SPEAKER_25]: Seriously, where else could me, a guy, get a character with red spiky hair like I have in real life sometimes and then get a big purple bow to wear in my hair?

2042
02:38:23,113 --> 02:38:25,055
[SPEAKER_07]: That bow gave you plus one intelligence.

2043
02:38:25,215 --> 02:38:29,438
[SPEAKER_25]: What other MMORPG will let me wear a big purple feminine bow in my hair?

2044
02:38:29,538 --> 02:38:32,780
[SPEAKER_25]: And I never did get one of the huge ass ribbons, though.

2045
02:38:32,800 --> 02:38:33,601
[SPEAKER_25]: That's what made me sad.

2046
02:38:33,621 --> 02:38:36,563
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, I had almost got you one until you said that you quit.

2047
02:38:39,136 --> 02:38:41,117
[SPEAKER_25]: I might have come back just for the big ribbon.

2048
02:38:43,758 --> 02:38:45,039
[SPEAKER_05]: Wasn't there a cake song about that?

2049
02:38:46,760 --> 02:38:47,760
[SPEAKER_25]: I don't... a ribbon?

2050
02:38:49,081 --> 02:38:50,361
[SPEAKER_05]: Pretty Pink Ribbon or something like that?

2051
02:38:51,062 --> 02:38:51,962
[SPEAKER_25]: Something like that, I don't know.

2052
02:38:53,041 --> 02:38:55,764
[SPEAKER_25]: All right, we're going to go to another break here.

2053
02:38:55,784 --> 02:39:03,933
[SPEAKER_25]: And when we come back, we're going to head on over to DDR Freak and check out our DDR Chit Chat Post of the Week.

2054
02:39:04,013 --> 02:39:06,675
[SPEAKER_25]: And we're going to chit chat about it a little bit here in studio as well.

2055
02:39:07,216 --> 02:39:08,758
[SPEAKER_25]: So we're going to do that when we come back.

2056
02:39:09,697 --> 02:39:14,663
[SPEAKER_25]: After this break, featuring some more music from 2DX Red.

2057
02:39:15,203 --> 02:39:22,371
[SPEAKER_25]: And we're going to start it off with a song that you actually saw in 8th style as well, if you picked up the home version.

2058
02:39:22,731 --> 02:39:23,592
[SPEAKER_25]: But it's a good song.

2059
02:39:23,953 --> 02:39:25,515
[SPEAKER_25]: It really is a good song, and it's worth playing again.

2060
02:39:25,575 --> 02:39:26,536
[SPEAKER_25]: It's Spiral Galaxy.

2061
02:39:27,076 --> 02:39:27,577
[SPEAKER_25]: Enjoy, guys.

2062
02:39:27,597 --> 02:39:29,499
[SPEAKER_25]: We'll be back with more Orange Launch Radio.

2063
02:39:45,149 --> 02:39:46,030
Thanks for watching!

2064
02:40:09,389 --> 02:40:09,969

Thanks for watching!

2069
02:42:24,969 --> 02:42:25,850
Thanks for watching!

2070
02:43:21,963 --> 02:43:25,227
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura DarkSakura, DarkSakura

2071
02:44:34,737 --> 02:44:35,721
Thanks for watching!

2072
02:45:33,664 --> 02:45:43,042
[SPEAKER_21]: And now, let's listen in to an Orange Lounge Radio staff meeting as they debate some of the new programming coming to Orange Lounge Radio.

2073
02:45:43,773 --> 02:45:47,857
[SPEAKER_25]: Jamie, I have a suggestion about some of the music in our Bomani Music and More program.

2074
02:45:47,897 --> 02:45:48,858
[SPEAKER_25]: Can we talk about that?

2075
02:45:49,138 --> 02:45:51,500
[SPEAKER_15]: No subject will ever be taboo.

2076
02:45:51,761 --> 02:45:55,404
[SPEAKER_25]: Well, I was thinking maybe we should move Pump Up the Volume from Tuesday Nights.

2077
02:45:55,924 --> 02:45:58,467
[SPEAKER_25]: Except, of course, a subject that was just under discussion.

2078
02:45:58,987 --> 02:46:04,332
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, well, what would you think if maybe we cut back on some of the tack music we play on the station?

2079
02:46:04,873 --> 02:46:06,174
[SPEAKER_15]: I collect your fucking head.

2080
02:46:08,112 --> 02:46:09,613
[SPEAKER_06]: Just like this fucker here.

2081
02:46:10,714 --> 02:46:14,398
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my god, why did you do that to Loki?

2082
02:46:14,678 --> 02:46:18,041
[SPEAKER_02]: The holic thing on episode 69 was just a joke!

2083
02:46:18,982 --> 02:46:25,428
[SPEAKER_18]: Now if any of you sons of bitches got anything else to say, now's the fucking time!

2084
02:46:26,669 --> 02:46:30,393
[SPEAKER_21]: Orange Lounge Radio, where everybody has a say.

2085
02:46:34,810 --> 02:46:38,373
[SPEAKER_25]: You know what else needs to happen when the station changes later this month?

2086
02:46:39,615 --> 02:46:40,275
[SPEAKER_25]: New promos.

2087
02:46:41,676 --> 02:46:43,278
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm thinking it's about time.

2088
02:46:43,438 --> 02:46:44,739
[SPEAKER_25]: I love that promo.

2089
02:46:44,799 --> 02:46:45,600
[SPEAKER_25]: Don't get me wrong.

2090
02:46:46,081 --> 02:46:47,242
[SPEAKER_25]: But damn, we need some new ones.

2091
02:46:47,882 --> 02:46:48,303
[SPEAKER_25]: Seriously.

2092
02:46:48,403 --> 02:46:51,786
[SPEAKER_25]: How long have we been using the Captain Jack crying one?

2093
02:46:51,966 --> 02:46:52,387
[SPEAKER_25]: Seriously.

2094
02:46:52,767 --> 02:46:54,529
[SPEAKER_07]: Since episode six, baby.

2095
02:46:55,475 --> 02:46:56,956
[SPEAKER_25]: I like the one that you made based on Dan's old joke.

2096
02:47:24,232 --> 02:47:24,973
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

2097
02:47:46,147 --> 02:47:46,788
[SPEAKER_25]: We don't care.

2098
02:47:47,228 --> 02:47:49,030
[SPEAKER_25]: So we're going to have an unofficial contest.

2099
02:47:49,090 --> 02:47:52,614
[SPEAKER_25]: And the prize, if you win the contest, is you get your promo plate on the air.

2100
02:47:53,495 --> 02:47:53,716
[SPEAKER_25]: What?

2101
02:47:53,856 --> 02:48:04,468
[SPEAKER_07]: We will send you autographed the EX-2 and the MAX-2, whatever the work.

2102
02:48:06,236 --> 02:48:09,177
[SPEAKER_25]: The Ultramix 2 and the Extreme V-Rares?

2103
02:48:09,277 --> 02:48:09,577
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

2104
02:48:10,917 --> 02:48:13,118
[SPEAKER_07]: I will send you autographed copies.

2105
02:48:13,338 --> 02:48:17,219
[SPEAKER_25]: Alright, we will pick our favorites and we will send them autographed copies of the V-Rares.

2106
02:48:17,639 --> 02:48:17,979
[SPEAKER_07]: By us.

2107
02:48:18,159 --> 02:48:18,639
[SPEAKER_25]: By us.

2108
02:48:18,879 --> 02:48:20,120
[SPEAKER_25]: And whoever else we can dig up.

2109
02:48:20,160 --> 02:48:22,500
[SPEAKER_25]: Maybe we can get some DDR Freak friends to sign them too.

2110
02:48:25,521 --> 02:48:31,723
[SPEAKER_25]: Granted, it's not as good as the Make Edit Get Porn contest, but it will have to do.

2111
02:48:33,035 --> 02:48:33,595
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you for watching!

2112
02:48:45,106 --> 02:48:48,168
[SPEAKER_25]: We did have a winner, and the winner at the time was Dave.

2113
02:48:48,308 --> 02:48:56,053
[SPEAKER_25]: Those of you who have been listening to the show forever might remember Dave, how he used to come on and listen in the studio with us.

2114
02:48:56,173 --> 02:48:57,434
[SPEAKER_07]: How he used to race me home.

2115
02:48:57,574 --> 02:49:02,777
[SPEAKER_25]: Him and Paul, but they do not, for some reason, come over anymore.

2116
02:49:02,797 --> 02:49:03,878
[SPEAKER_25]: We're not cool anymore.

2117
02:49:03,918 --> 02:49:04,839
[SPEAKER_25]: We're not cool anymore.

2118
02:49:07,380 --> 02:49:09,642
[SPEAKER_25]: They're probably out screwing girls now, basically.

2119
02:49:09,682 --> 02:49:12,463
[SPEAKER_25]: They discovered girls.

2120
02:49:12,483 --> 02:49:13,464
[SPEAKER_05]: Puberty hit or something?

2121
02:49:15,342 --> 02:49:26,830
[SPEAKER_25]: But anyways, so, he won one of the prizes and I ended up giving him literally a 50 box of porn.

2122
02:49:27,851 --> 02:49:33,055
[SPEAKER_25]: And we're talking like, this isn't no small box of porn, this was a giant box of porn.

2123
02:49:35,096 --> 02:49:36,197
[SPEAKER_25]: And he earned every bit of it too.

2124
02:49:38,922 --> 02:49:40,404
[SPEAKER_25]: DDR Chit Chat Post of the Week

2125
02:50:04,170 --> 02:50:13,438
[SPEAKER_25]: That's right, when we get bored on this show and we're desperate for materials, we turn to our buddies over on DDR Freak to provide us with the inspiration we need to keep this show going.

2126
02:50:14,740 --> 02:50:18,883
[SPEAKER_25]: And we pick a post from DDR Chit Chat and make it our Post of the Week.

2127
02:50:19,404 --> 02:50:30,534
[SPEAKER_25]: Now, it was very tempting to use this as the Post of the Week, which actually was suggested to us by Flairone, which had the subject, Does this girl worth risking?

2128
02:50:31,457 --> 02:50:34,959
[SPEAKER_25]: Hi, several months ago I have signed erotic teen site.

2129
02:50:35,239 --> 02:50:39,060
[SPEAKER_25]: I have asked owner of this site and he gave me mail one of the models.

2130
02:50:39,140 --> 02:50:43,122
[SPEAKER_25]: Her name is Julia and here her free page.

2131
02:50:43,562 --> 02:50:47,004
[SPEAKER_25]: How do you think it is possible to have long relation with such models?

2132
02:50:47,384 --> 02:50:49,485
[SPEAKER_25]: Is it safe to go Ukraine now for meeting?

2133
02:50:52,446 --> 02:50:56,748
[SPEAKER_25]: That sounds amazingly like the Henry Rollins bit about the guy from Hungary.

2134
02:50:59,693 --> 02:51:12,038
[SPEAKER_25]: You know, the problem I have with that post, besides the fact it doesn't make any fucking sense, is that we have to have a little bit of a discussion on the post of the week.

2135
02:51:12,138 --> 02:51:14,339
[SPEAKER_25]: So, that does not work for the post of the week.

2136
02:51:14,379 --> 02:51:14,999
[SPEAKER_25]: I apologize.

2137
02:51:15,880 --> 02:51:21,242
[SPEAKER_25]: Now, this was actually, I can't fault this post for wording or grammar or anything.

2138
02:51:21,302 --> 02:51:23,843
[SPEAKER_25]: It's actually a pretty interesting post.

2139
02:51:23,903 --> 02:51:29,325
[SPEAKER_25]: I gotta ask the folks in chat, or the folks not only in chat, but the folks in studio what they think about this one.

2140
02:51:30,671 --> 02:51:40,773
[SPEAKER_25]: This is a post and it's titled, Middle Finger Usage We've all seen people make use of their middle finger in pictures of their DDR accomplishments What's the significance of this?

2141
02:51:43,794 --> 02:51:46,094
[SPEAKER_25]: Does it symbolize hate for the song?

2142
02:51:47,055 --> 02:51:49,515
[SPEAKER_25]: Does it mean the accomplishment was hard to do?

2143
02:51:50,455 --> 02:51:53,176
[SPEAKER_25]: Are they full of rage and don't know where to let it out?

2144
02:51:53,857 --> 02:51:55,458
[SPEAKER_25]: Is it the end thing to do?

2145
02:51:56,179 --> 02:51:57,720
[SPEAKER_25]: If so, why did it become this way?

2146
02:51:58,061 --> 02:52:00,903
[SPEAKER_25]: Do they want to look like rebels, and are they succeeding?

2147
02:52:01,604 --> 02:52:04,226
[SPEAKER_25]: Are they conformists who don't even know the significance?

2148
02:52:04,906 --> 02:52:08,629
[SPEAKER_25]: I suspect a combination of the last three, but I don't really know.

2149
02:52:10,711 --> 02:52:13,633
[SPEAKER_25]: It's telling the song, I fucked your mom, and that's it.

2150
02:52:14,014 --> 02:52:14,855
[SPEAKER_25]: That's what it is.

2151
02:52:15,875 --> 02:52:19,699
[SPEAKER_25]: More or less, you know, it's like, ha, I fucked your mom, and I triple-A'd you.

2152
02:52:20,019 --> 02:52:20,259
[SPEAKER_25]: The end.

2153
02:52:21,334 --> 02:52:23,735
[SPEAKER_25]: Is that where the expression, I triple-A'd your mom, comes from?

2154
02:52:23,775 --> 02:52:24,556
[SPEAKER_25]: Because I've heard that.

2155
02:52:24,796 --> 02:52:27,117
[SPEAKER_25]: I've read that expression a lot on some of the message boards.

2156
02:52:27,137 --> 02:52:28,498
[SPEAKER_25]: And I always read that and go, God, you're 14.

2157
02:52:28,538 --> 02:52:32,059
[SPEAKER_25]: To be honest, I'm just totally guessing.

2158
02:52:32,079 --> 02:52:33,500
[SPEAKER_25]: I have no fucking clue why.

2159
02:52:33,900 --> 02:52:35,441
[SPEAKER_25]: I think it's because kids are stupid.

2160
02:52:36,021 --> 02:52:40,083
[SPEAKER_25]: I mean, because maybe flashing your penis is illegal.

2161
02:52:40,563 --> 02:52:46,286
[SPEAKER_25]: So, you know, flipping off the camera is like, look at me, I'm hardcore and I'm rebellious.

2162
02:52:47,567 --> 02:52:47,867
[SPEAKER_25]: I don't know.

2163
02:52:49,028 --> 02:52:52,949
[SPEAKER_25]: Jamie, are there any pictures of you on the internet giving the middle finger on a DDR machine?

2164
02:52:53,769 --> 02:52:54,790
[SPEAKER_07]: There have been, actually.

2165
02:52:55,630 --> 02:52:56,010
[SPEAKER_25]: Why?

2166
02:52:56,550 --> 02:52:57,630
[SPEAKER_25]: Why were you giving the finger?

2167
02:52:58,010 --> 02:52:59,771
[SPEAKER_07]: I think I was pissed off at the song.

2168
02:53:01,391 --> 02:53:02,432
[SPEAKER_25]: It's just a song.

2169
02:53:02,732 --> 02:53:04,012
[SPEAKER_25]: What did the song do to you?

2170
02:53:04,972 --> 02:53:06,413
[SPEAKER_25]: Fuck your mother.

2171
02:53:09,053 --> 02:53:10,514
[SPEAKER_25]: Did the song triple A your mom?

2172
02:53:11,094 --> 02:53:13,034
[SPEAKER_07]: Back in the day, possibly, but not currently.

2173
02:53:13,975 --> 02:53:15,415
[SPEAKER_07]: Her husband would take exception to that.

2174
02:53:17,975 --> 02:53:21,396
[SPEAKER_25]: Bugged, now you've given the middle finger to several DDR machines, right?

2175
02:53:22,477 --> 02:53:23,097
[SPEAKER_05]: Sure, why not?

2176
02:53:23,717 --> 02:53:24,538
[SPEAKER_05]: I can go do that right now.

2177
02:53:25,598 --> 02:53:30,040
[SPEAKER_25]: But are you just giving the middle finger to the DDR machine because you're like fucking losers or what?

2178
02:53:30,300 --> 02:53:32,001
[SPEAKER_05]: No, it's because I can't get my zipper down at the same time.

2179
02:53:34,182 --> 02:53:36,603
[SPEAKER_05]: You're supposed to laugh, damn it.

2180
02:53:38,143 --> 02:53:39,684
[SPEAKER_25]: Here's a quote from the chat room.

2181
02:53:41,169 --> 02:53:42,850
[SPEAKER_25]: Wow, that's a really good question.

2182
02:53:43,150 --> 02:53:49,672
[SPEAKER_25]: And Illusion says, I'm only going to say this because I know Illusion happens to live in this same area, so I guess he's including himself.

2183
02:53:50,052 --> 02:53:53,453
[SPEAKER_25]: Illusion says, all those SoCal people always flip off the camera.

2184
02:53:53,493 --> 02:53:54,953
[SPEAKER_25]: They look like such dipshits.

2185
02:53:58,454 --> 02:53:59,254
[SPEAKER_25]: I don't know.

2186
02:54:00,395 --> 02:54:00,895
[SPEAKER_25]: I don't know why.

2187
02:54:01,155 --> 02:54:02,495
[SPEAKER_25]: I mean, I flip off the camera sometimes.

2188
02:54:02,535 --> 02:54:04,236
[SPEAKER_25]: I flip off the webcam all the time.

2189
02:54:04,636 --> 02:54:07,517
[SPEAKER_25]: I have a picture of me flipping off people wearing a cast.

2190
02:54:09,500 --> 02:54:12,702
[SPEAKER_07]: And then I had the cast cut off with hedge cutters.

2191
02:54:12,982 --> 02:54:15,924
[SPEAKER_25]: That was one of the few pictures that you posted on Orange Sounds Radio, wasn't it?

2192
02:54:16,484 --> 02:54:22,067
[SPEAKER_25]: You know, when I flip you guys off on the webcam... It's a symbol of love.

2193
02:54:22,167 --> 02:54:22,707
[SPEAKER_25]: It is.

2194
02:54:22,767 --> 02:54:23,688
[SPEAKER_25]: It's a symbol of love.

2195
02:54:23,748 --> 02:54:25,609
[SPEAKER_25]: We really fucking love you.

2196
02:54:25,649 --> 02:54:27,670
[SPEAKER_25]: Well, what does the word fuck really mean, though?

2197
02:54:27,710 --> 02:54:29,411
[SPEAKER_25]: It means, I want to make love to you.

2198
02:54:30,410 --> 02:54:33,632
[SPEAKER_25]: So when I flip you guys off on the webcam, I'm saying, I want to make love to you.

2199
02:54:34,072 --> 02:54:40,636
[SPEAKER_25]: And when they flip you off when they're playing DDR, they're really saying, I want to make sweet, sweet love to that song I just played.

2200
02:54:42,538 --> 02:54:51,963
[SPEAKER_05]: That's not the way I always understand it, especially when there's a lot of cursing that doesn't go with the love, you know, the God damn, doesn't really match.

2201
02:54:52,284 --> 02:54:56,986
[SPEAKER_25]: I've triplied that song and I'd like to make sweet, sweet love to your mom or something, I don't know.

2202
02:54:58,334 --> 02:55:03,338
[SPEAKER_25]: Maybe Loki just does it because he heard Freeze pop over the intercom when the picture was taken.

2203
02:55:05,360 --> 02:55:05,700
[SPEAKER_25]: What now?

2204
02:55:07,402 --> 02:55:08,123
[SPEAKER_05]: Do my best!

2205
02:55:10,505 --> 02:55:11,566
[SPEAKER_25]: I completely missed that.

2206
02:55:11,806 --> 02:55:12,586
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, yes you did.

2207
02:55:12,646 --> 02:55:13,027
[SPEAKER_05]: It's funny.

2208
02:55:14,408 --> 02:55:15,529
[SPEAKER_25]: I'm sure it wasn't, but that's okay.

2209
02:55:17,798 --> 02:55:19,159
[SPEAKER_25]: And we have a question from the chatroom.

2210
02:55:19,200 --> 02:55:21,201
[SPEAKER_25]: Flairone says, you want to make love to me, Sky?

2211
02:55:22,202 --> 02:55:24,203
[SPEAKER_25]: In reality, yes, I want to make love to all of you.

2212
02:55:24,244 --> 02:55:28,987
[SPEAKER_25]: And there's a good reason for that, because you guys are what have made this station so damn great.

2213
02:55:29,187 --> 02:55:31,169
[SPEAKER_25]: And for that, I want to make love to all of you.

2214
02:55:32,510 --> 02:55:37,534
[SPEAKER_25]: For those of you guys that are in the chatroom and support this show, DDR Angel's running away right now.

2215
02:55:37,574 --> 02:55:38,255
[SPEAKER_25]: Why are you doing that?

2216
02:55:38,755 --> 02:55:41,117
[SPEAKER_25]: I didn't mean now, you know, just someday.

2217
02:55:41,137 --> 02:55:41,217
[SPEAKER_25]: Okay.

2218
02:55:42,082 --> 02:55:43,402
[SPEAKER_25]: In the metaphorical sense.

2219
02:55:43,442 --> 02:55:45,423
[SPEAKER_25]: That doesn't mean I actually want to take your club.

2220
02:55:45,663 --> 02:55:46,804
[SPEAKER_25]: In the metaphorical sense.

2221
02:55:47,344 --> 02:55:48,044
[SPEAKER_25]: You get what I'm saying?

2222
02:55:48,664 --> 02:55:51,225
[SPEAKER_25]: Jamie, don't you want to make love to all our listeners in the metaphorical sense?

2223
02:55:51,265 --> 02:55:51,845
[SPEAKER_25]: Hell no!

2224
02:55:53,046 --> 02:55:54,486
[SPEAKER_25]: Do you know where some of those people have been?

2225
02:55:55,026 --> 02:55:55,966
[SPEAKER_05]: Some have been with your mother!

2226
02:55:59,227 --> 02:56:02,829
[SPEAKER_25]: Do we have any hot Asian big-breasted chicks listening?

2227
02:56:03,629 --> 02:56:03,889
[SPEAKER_05]: I am.

2228
02:56:04,029 --> 02:56:04,829
[SPEAKER_25]: Otherwise, you know.

2229
02:56:05,810 --> 02:56:07,030
[SPEAKER_05]: I am, and you can't prove that I'm not.

2230
02:56:10,288 --> 02:56:33,853
[SPEAKER_25]: Yeah, I think I can, but anyways, um, cause I know it's mostly ad-listing guys, and I'm not into that, so, we need to be hitting up our big-breasted Asian demographic, goddammit, cause this is what we're, like, really hurting on, is the big-breasted female Asian demographic, you know, age range of, you know, 21 to 28.

2231
02:56:36,468 --> 02:56:40,150
[SPEAKER_25]: Well, maybe you need to think of a show that would cater to the big-breasted Asian women.

2232
02:56:40,610 --> 02:56:41,350
[SPEAKER_25]: Think about this one.

2233
02:56:42,210 --> 02:56:42,991
[SPEAKER_05]: Big Booby Chicks.

2234
02:56:46,092 --> 02:56:47,093
[SPEAKER_05]: That'd be a BBC show.

2235
02:56:49,634 --> 02:56:54,036
[SPEAKER_25]: Well, I could think of a couple ideas for a show.

2236
02:56:54,536 --> 02:56:57,857
[SPEAKER_25]: However, they would be very inappropriate for the radio.

2237
02:56:59,118 --> 02:56:59,658
[SPEAKER_05]: Like this isn't?

2238
02:57:01,351 --> 02:57:08,217
[SPEAKER_25]: Well, I'm trying to back away from making excessive amounts of racial stereotypes.

2239
02:57:08,677 --> 02:57:09,598
[SPEAKER_05]: Other people have an idea.

2240
02:57:09,718 --> 02:57:10,719
[SPEAKER_05]: Ask G4 how they did it.

2241
02:57:11,599 --> 02:57:13,981
[SPEAKER_25]: Now, Rychan and Joyce are sitting there in the chat room.

2242
02:57:14,942 --> 02:57:18,565
[SPEAKER_25]: And they're saying, I've got the hot, hot Asian over here.

2243
02:57:19,506 --> 02:57:24,189
[SPEAKER_25]: And now they're claiming that there's no... They said, if you don't require big breasts.

2244
02:57:24,209 --> 02:57:25,931
[SPEAKER_25]: But I'm thinking the breasts are just fine.

2245
02:57:25,971 --> 02:57:28,052
[SPEAKER_25]: I'm thinking that they're just being a little self-deprecating.

2246
02:57:28,433 --> 02:57:30,034
[SPEAKER_25]: That's two women over there listening.

2247
02:57:31,041 --> 02:57:33,222
[SPEAKER_25]: Hey, that's two out of, you know, whatever.

2248
02:57:33,262 --> 02:57:34,542
[SPEAKER_25]: That's a good percentage.

2249
02:57:34,743 --> 02:57:35,463
[SPEAKER_25]: It's more than one.

2250
02:57:39,745 --> 02:57:40,605
[SPEAKER_25]: Yes, DarkSakura.

2251
02:57:41,085 --> 02:57:42,025
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not commenting.

2252
02:57:43,686 --> 02:57:44,006
[SPEAKER_25]: Wise.

2253
02:57:44,146 --> 02:57:44,767
[SPEAKER_25]: Very wise.

2254
02:57:45,487 --> 02:57:50,769
[SPEAKER_25]: If we have the big boobied Asian women show, we can certainly have the pantsless rage show.

2255
02:57:51,129 --> 02:57:51,569
[SPEAKER_25]: That's fine.

2256
02:57:54,991 --> 02:57:55,471
[SPEAKER_25]: The what?

2257
02:57:57,589 --> 02:57:58,089
[SPEAKER_07]: Old joke.

2258
02:57:58,430 --> 02:58:07,716
[SPEAKER_25]: You need to, Loki, you seriously need to register a site, just bigbreastedasianchicksonddr.com Quick, hold his credit card.

2259
02:58:09,677 --> 02:58:12,179
[SPEAKER_25]: Maybe, maybe our webmaster can help us make that happen.

2260
02:58:12,199 --> 02:58:18,583
[SPEAKER_25]: You know, it's only like, what, nine dollars or something to register a domain name.

2261
02:58:19,123 --> 02:58:20,084
[SPEAKER_25]: It's really fucking cheap.

2262
02:58:20,484 --> 02:58:22,926
[SPEAKER_25]: I'll just have it point to, you know, Loki Fusion, so.

2263
02:58:27,339 --> 02:58:32,102
[SPEAKER_25]: Anyway, now Rychan and Joyce are arguing about their boobies.

2264
02:58:32,982 --> 02:58:35,164
[SPEAKER_25]: I don't know, maybe we'll get them on the skyline another week.

2265
02:58:35,404 --> 02:58:38,025
[SPEAKER_25]: Sorry guys, but we do have to bring this show to a close.

2266
02:58:38,866 --> 02:58:39,326
[SPEAKER_25]: Yes, Loki?

2267
02:58:40,006 --> 02:58:43,448
[SPEAKER_25]: I mean, not saying that I'm hating against the Asians with smaller breasts.

2268
02:58:43,508 --> 02:58:44,589
[SPEAKER_25]: I mean, that's all good.

2269
02:58:45,790 --> 02:58:47,171
[SPEAKER_25]: I mean, you can't hate on it.

2270
02:58:48,171 --> 02:58:51,333
[SPEAKER_25]: Like they say, any more than a handful is a waste.

2271
02:58:51,693 --> 02:58:53,734
[SPEAKER_25]: So, or was that a mouthful?

2272
02:58:53,895 --> 02:58:54,475
[SPEAKER_25]: I can't remember.

2273
02:58:54,495 --> 02:58:56,416
[SPEAKER_25]: I think it was a mouthful, yes.

2274
02:58:58,489 --> 02:59:00,550
[SPEAKER_25]: and we're getting a post to our website here.

2275
02:59:00,570 --> 02:59:06,252
[SPEAKER_25]: It says www.bigbreastedasians.com I'm sure that site already exists, people.

2276
02:59:06,352 --> 02:59:07,052
[SPEAKER_25]: I'm sure it does.

2277
02:59:07,812 --> 02:59:08,672
[SPEAKER_25]: Here's the catch, though.

2278
02:59:08,772 --> 02:59:14,534
[SPEAKER_25]: Big Breasted Asians playing DDR is the catch.

2279
02:59:14,774 --> 02:59:15,215
[SPEAKER_25]: Oh, it doesn't?

2280
02:59:15,555 --> 02:59:18,356
[SPEAKER_25]: Bigbreastedasians.com doesn't exist?

2281
02:59:22,117 --> 02:59:22,497
[SPEAKER_25]: Wow.

2282
02:59:22,517 --> 02:59:22,577
[SPEAKER_25]: Wow.

2283
02:59:24,324 --> 02:59:28,708
[SPEAKER_25]: We need to register big-breasted Asians and have it point to Orange Lounge Radio.

2284
02:59:32,511 --> 02:59:37,536
[SPEAKER_25]: Big-breasted Asian women playing DDR.com certainly doesn't have a thing.

2285
02:59:39,117 --> 02:59:39,418
[SPEAKER_25]: Alright.

2286
02:59:39,438 --> 02:59:41,099
[SPEAKER_25]: Alright.

2287
02:59:41,139 --> 02:59:42,280
[SPEAKER_25]: Loki's going to work on that.

2288
02:59:42,420 --> 02:59:45,163
[SPEAKER_25]: I can't believe big-breasted Asians isn't registered.

2289
02:59:45,783 --> 02:59:48,586
[SPEAKER_25]: Somebody can get us that for Christmas and have it point to Orange Lounge Radio.

2290
02:59:51,500 --> 02:59:56,283
[SPEAKER_25]: Seriously, I will point that to Orange Lounge Radio if I can do that.

2291
02:59:58,045 --> 03:00:01,328
[SPEAKER_25]: I will seriously... Wait, it's like only a few bucks.

2292
03:00:01,408 --> 03:00:02,368
[SPEAKER_25]: I mean, I could do that.

2293
03:00:02,849 --> 03:00:03,369
[SPEAKER_25]: That'd be funny.

2294
03:00:06,071 --> 03:00:10,235
[SPEAKER_25]: Oh, actually, Jason says BigBreastedAsians.com does exist.

2295
03:00:10,335 --> 03:00:10,835
[SPEAKER_25]: He checked.

2296
03:00:11,396 --> 03:00:12,717
[SPEAKER_08]: I just checked and it wasn't there.

2297
03:00:14,338 --> 03:00:15,639
[SPEAKER_05]: It may be registered.

2298
03:00:15,679 --> 03:00:17,061
[SPEAKER_25]: It may be registered with no website.

2299
03:00:17,561 --> 03:00:18,762
[SPEAKER_08]: That's probably it then.

2300
03:00:20,493 --> 03:00:25,975
[SPEAKER_25]: Alright, I would have a hard time believing that BigBreastedAsians.com wouldn't exist.

2301
03:00:26,955 --> 03:00:34,277
[SPEAKER_25]: Now maybe there could be like BigTittiedAsians or BigJuggedAsians or well, you know what, we really need to end this show at this point, I'm thinking.

2302
03:00:36,618 --> 03:00:40,499
[SPEAKER_25]: In order to do that, we have to go around and get everybody's final thought.

2303
03:00:41,079 --> 03:00:42,000
[SPEAKER_25]: Bud, your final thought.

2304
03:00:42,340 --> 03:00:43,020
[SPEAKER_25]: Puppy Bowl.

2305
03:00:44,560 --> 03:00:46,461
[SPEAKER_25]: And TDR Angel, your final thought.

2306
03:00:48,001 --> 03:00:50,062
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, I don't have one, sorry.

2307
03:00:52,079 --> 03:00:54,120
[SPEAKER_25]: DarkSakura... Actually, Loki, your final thought.

2308
03:00:56,460 --> 03:01:00,702
[SPEAKER_25]: I hope that battery doesn't explode when I'm done charging it and plug it into the monitor.

2309
03:01:01,262 --> 03:01:04,703
[SPEAKER_25]: So it's like I've had really bad luck with batteries.

2310
03:01:05,203 --> 03:01:05,764
[SPEAKER_25]: Lick it first.

2311
03:01:07,364 --> 03:01:11,966
[SPEAKER_25]: My final thought is you better take that shit outside when you plug it in the first time in case you start any fires.

2312
03:01:12,686 --> 03:01:13,686
[SPEAKER_25]: DarkSakura, your final thought.

2313
03:01:14,106 --> 03:01:16,687
[SPEAKER_07]: Japanese games that have intros in German are awesome.

2314
03:01:18,268 --> 03:01:18,808
[SPEAKER_25]: Second thought.

2315
03:01:20,202 --> 03:01:21,682
[SPEAKER_25]: Tonight's final word.

2316
03:01:21,782 --> 03:01:27,763
[SPEAKER_25]: I'm going to give the final word of the show tonight to DDR Angel because she hasn't said shit tonight so she needs to get at least one word in.

2317
03:01:28,763 --> 03:01:30,164
[SPEAKER_25]: And thank you guys very much for listening.

2318
03:01:30,504 --> 03:01:31,684
[SPEAKER_25]: We will see you next week.

2319
03:01:31,744 --> 03:01:33,224
[SPEAKER_25]: Same bat time, same bat channel.

2320

[SPEAKER_25]: Thanks a lot for tuning in and supporting Orange Lounge Radio.

2321
03:01:35,625 --> 03:01:39,345

03:01:45,606 --> 03:01:46,006
[SPEAKER_25]: Love you guys.

2326
03:01:46,287 --> 03:01:46,767
[SPEAKER_25]: All right, Angel.

2327
03:01:46,987 --> 03:01:47,647
[SPEAKER_25]: Tonight's final word.

2328
03:01:48,667 --> 03:01:48,967
[SPEAKER_08]: Bye.

2329
03:01:50,330 --> 03:01:55,195
[SPEAKER_20]: That does it for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio Live.

2333
03:02:13,852 --> 03:02:14,852
[SPEAKER_17]: I am Cornholio.

2334
03:02:15,232 --> 03:02:16,613
[SPEAKER_17]: I need tippy for my bunghole.

2335
03:02:16,853 --> 03:02:18,633
[SPEAKER_17]: Screw you!

2336
03:02:18,933 --> 03:02:20,414
[SPEAKER_17]: Do not make my bunghole angry.

2337
03:02:21,494 --> 03:02:22,494
[SPEAKER_17]: Do you have any oleo?

2338
03:02:23,874 --> 03:02:27,095
[SPEAKER_18]: I am Gusterbuzz, Lord of the Mountains.

[SPEAKER_18]: Behold my Patrick Duffy legs.

2340
03:02:29,816 --> 03:02:30,596
[SPEAKER_17]: Are you threatening me?

2341
03:02:30,836 --> 03:02:32,357
[SPEAKER_18]: Go home, you little dildo.

2342
03:02:32,557 --> 03:02:34,477
[SPEAKER_18]: You will give me tippy, Bungholio.

2343
03:02:34,757 --> 03:02:36,097
[SPEAKER_17]: Kick him in the nads, Beavis.

2344
03:02:36,638 --> 03:02:36,738
Aye.

2345
03:02:36,898 --> 03:02:38,298
[SPEAKER_17]: Does not your scrotum need kicking?

2346
03:02:39,330 --> 03:02:44,952
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you very much for listening, and we'll see you next week.

2347
03:03:31,070 --> 03:03:33,791
[SPEAKER_25]: Another night gone here at the Orange Lounge studio.

2348
03:03:34,211 --> 03:03:36,393
[SPEAKER_25]: Another work week about ready to start.

2349
03:03:36,413 --> 03:03:38,053
[SPEAKER_25]: Another school week about ready to start.

2350
03:03:40,615 --> 03:03:41,355
[SPEAKER_25]: Sadness.

2351
03:03:42,216 --> 03:03:42,416
[SPEAKER_03]: What?

2352
03:03:43,817 --> 03:03:44,237
[SPEAKER_03]: What, Angel?

2353
03:03:46,658 --> 03:03:50,160
[SPEAKER_08]: I just whispered the death game and he didn't even say anything.

2354
03:03:50,640 --> 03:03:51,561
[SPEAKER_08]: Because I couldn't hear you.

2355
03:03:52,661 --> 03:03:55,463
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, yeah, it was supposed to be like a seven days type whisper thing.

2356
03:03:57,724 --> 03:03:59,265
[SPEAKER_25]: Jamie, you look like you're about to say something over there.

2357
03:04:01,246 --> 03:04:01,726
[SPEAKER_08]: LighterMouth
