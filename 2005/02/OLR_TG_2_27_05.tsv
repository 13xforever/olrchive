317	3958	Orange Lounge Radio To Go Edition, week of February 28th, 2005.
4598	15562	And now, the Orange Lounge Radio To Go Edition, your internet radio home for discussion on rhythm and music gaming, and all the news on video games that don't suck.
16022	20243	And now, here are your hosts, DarkSakura, Sky, and Loki.
21331	23392	Hello again everybody!
23612	31897	Welcome to another edition of the Orange Lounge Radio To Go Edition, our podcast where we get to talk to you about video games that don't suck.
32577	36239	And honestly, a few that do suck sometimes, they just slip in there by chance.
36980	41282	Joining me as always, my lovely co-host, say hello to DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.
41302	42163	Suck is relative.
43103	43944	It is.
44004	46685	What I may think sucks, you may think not sucks.
47506	48146	Like freeze pops.
49175	52117	Final Fantasy XI because that's all I've been conscious for
68891	69572	I've been sick.
69692	72113	Oh yes, you've been battling the sickness this week.
72434	72994	The disease.
74035	77117	Does it kind of help you to just sit there and veg out to the roleplaying?
77137	80199	You're like, slash, slash, cure, cure.
80219	81921	Or in your case, cure, cure.
82221	89646	Actually, in my case, it's been, the order is blind, poisoned, paralyzed.
89666	91308	You got your system worked out.
91788	94470	Yeah, I have my system worked out, sadly.
95089	97790	But you're much farther in the game this time than you were the first time around.
97910	101451	Yeah, I hit level 10 on my sub job.
101611	103232	What do you think is doing it for you?
103272	105892	Just the fact that you have more people to play with this time?
106052	109333	The fact that I just have people to play with in general.
110414	114775	I maybe played for three months and played with people all of twice.
119116	119617	So that's it?
119677	120497	Just Final Fantasy XI?
121917	122738	And some Guitar Freaks.
123618	124038	Very cool.
125124	125785	Just for the heck of it.
126265	127346	Because Dan wanted to play.
127766	128347	That's a good reason.
128867	130388	All right, Loki, what have you been playing?
131429	136292	I played, well, I started off the week trying to get some other games.
136932	140835	I played a little bit of Final Fantasy featuring Charlie's Angels.
140875	142436	I mean, Final Fantasy X too.
143277	145778	And that lost my interest really quick.
146379	148140	It's just too annoying.
148340	150642	Honestly, the voice acting drove me away.
150782	151282	It was just...
152819	153280	Scary.
153660	158025	I couldn't possibly go through that game anymore with Riku yelling some really weird shit.
158725	159226	It's not for me.
159724	163827	So then I went and played a little bit of Derby Owner's Club and my horse, i.e.
163887	165989	Children, is doing very well.
166329	171554	Now explain, some folks out there may have never heard of Derby Owner's Club because this podcast goes to a slightly different audience.
171634	172875	What is Derby Owner's Club all about?
172895	175037	Derby Owner's Club is this game made by Sega.
175097	179120	It's giant, it's huge, it's a good $100,000 cabinet.
179160	186826	Basically what you do is you raise and race racing horses and it's pretty much got the whole jockey thing.
186886	188608	You train your horses and you...
189328	190929	I should scan some of my cards for our listeners.
190949	191930	I only have four horses, because my...
214371	216432	I have a horse named Brittany Spears somewhere.
216472	217372	She might still be in my wallet.
217392	218253	I remember Politary.
218413	219994	Yes, I had a horse named Politary as well.
220294	222355	I have Magical Sound, who's retired.
222956	227879	I have Last Message, and Shiroi that's an all-white horse, which is like one of the rarest ones.
228599	230200	And I have Gangoro, who's a panda.
231361	233923	I also had a horse named George Bush at one point.
234043	234483	Yes, you did.
234543	235844	Because, you know, so I could whip him.
236364	236764	It was fun.
237445	240887	The other horse racing game I like was Daytona.
241229	243611	Remember Daytona and the horse code that they had?
244432	250939	What was the game that they used to have at the bowling alley here in town where you would ride the horse humping machine?
250979	251619	What was that?
252761	253782	Final Furlong.
253882	254903	Final Furlong!
255043	257005	Oh, God, that game was hilarious.
257705	259507	I think they still have that game, to be honest.
259687	260008	Really?
260028	261850	I didn't see it when I was there a couple weeks ago.
261990	263571	Well, I know they had it at one time.
263611	265253	They had it at Paradise Island.
265757	266378	I love Prop Cycle!
283311	284431	Prop Cycle's cool, though.
284471	285872	That's a good laugh.
286772	293314	I want to position myself next to the back of the bike and feel the breeze, especially after a game of DDR.
293714	295934	I worked at a Namco arcade when Prop Cycle came out.
295974	297495	My boss played it.
297535	298615	They're early to play it.
298855	304676	I actually do have Prop Cycle in the main cabinet, and sadly enough, something's lost in the transition.
304796	306837	It is not the same.
306877	309158	Prop Cycle's one of those games that cannot be emulated.
309278	310838	You can hook up an exercise bike to it.
311198	312299	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
339554	340676	God bless Dave and Busters.
340916	345243	A place where you can drink and then play the games, even though the games are extremely overpriced, as are the drinks.
345524	345884	Still fun.
346425	349951	One thing, though, in the defensive final furlong is that it's a really good ab workout.
351674	352034	It is.
352475	353737	I got very tired playing that game.
354689	357891	Anything else you've been playing besides Derby Owner's Club and your horse, I Eat Children?
357911	360873	Let's see, what else have I been playing?
363755	367157	Really, I haven't been playing anything other than that, I don't think.
368118	370359	Oh, we played a little bit of the guy game this week.
370439	371900	Oh, damn you, I was going to bring that up.
372000	374381	Me and Loki were playing the guy game this week.
376042	377123	I'll let you talk about it.
377323	378504	All I will say is I played the game.
379409	380529	All right, I'll finish.
380790	388012	I was playing the game, and you know, some folks may be surprised by that statement because I know the rumors that are going around about me, and they're all true.
388913	389613	But you know what?
389893	392234	Playing those kinds of games are fun once in a while, damn it.
393774	395235	You know, you get to see boobs, and that's funny.
395655	400977	So we were playing this game, and man, the girl that I decided to play as, she was so ugly.
401793	402753	So ugly.
403413	404193	And I won.
404273	406054	So my girl got to do a lap dance at the end.
406074	407414	And everybody was like, God, no.
407614	416036	As I put it earlier in the other show, she was a cross between, I would say, Tori Spelling and Bea Arthur.
416756	417416	So it was China.
418876	420997	Kind of, except like, you know, blonde.
421197	423397	She had the Tori Spelling horse face.
423457	427318	And there's this one thing, picture of her where she's wearing like an orange nightie.
427678	428958	And it looks like she just ate a baby.
429600	430140	It really does.
430401	436385	Because she spread it out, and it's sort of like the color, because it wasn't too crisp of color.
436465	439547	It kind of matched her skin color, so it looked like she just blew up.
441168	447152	And I remember exclaiming, oh my god, she exploded, and Loki's girlfriend was just in stitches for like 15 minutes.
447172	447753	It was funny.
448653	449874	So was I. It was funny.
449914	451035	Sounds riotous.
452391	455015	Too bad there's not going to be a sequel because of that lawsuit and everything.
455115	455756	That makes me sad.
455776	456557	Oh, I'm sure there will be.
456697	458240	But they got the lawsuit!
458260	463828	They're still going to do it, I bet you, because they'll probably say, oh, well, you know, breach of contract.
464790	465651	or whatever you know.
466351	467752	There's got to be some sort of protection.
467772	475477	They can't do breach of contract because any contract created with a minor is voidable.
475497	479439	What kind of protection do companies have against people that are going to be lying to them?
479579	482921	The contract is still voidable whether they know the age or not.
482961	488064	If they are of the age of minority within their state, then there technically is no contract.
488104	488484	That's true.
489485	490926	Legally, there is not a contract.
490946	492647	I think they could probably still sue them.
493371	495493	They can't see there, but they can take a suit.
496714	500917	What was the... There is a suit they could probably take against their parents for allowing the...
502612	504854	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
525813	529115	I don't know, but couldn't they, like, you know, take losses or something?
529455	534078	Couldn't they blame the losses of this game because they had to pull it off the shelves on these parents?
534158	534718	You know what?
535059	538300	Long story short, it's too hard to see the boobs in that game anyway.
538340	540602	Seriously, you gotta cheat if you really want to see the boobs.
540882	542723	So, you know, I mean, come on.
542763	543984	You're not ever gonna see the boobs.
544024	545985	I didn't even realize it, though, when we played...
546645	550229	You know, yesterday, I thought there was like three different sets of pictures.
550650	554094	Then I went and scrolled down, there was like a good seven or eight sets.
554154	555516	I'm like, holy crap!
555956	557578	I'm like, I have to go through all of this?
557598	558679	Yeah, that was a lot of boobs.
559240	560081	Alright, let's move on.
560481	563865	Let's change the topic to something else that is completely on another topic.
564225	567109	Completely from boobs to the family-friendly Nintendo.
568058	583969	Now we've kind of been speculating that Nintendo's going to do this for quite some time, but they're actually going to do this new thing with the DS, and they're going to start testing this in Japan, where you can actually use these kiosks in selected stores around Japan, and you can download things to your DS.
584369	588552	Which, you know, duh, we kind of suspected something like this would happen for a while, it's just a, you know...
589421	591682	An obvious side effect of the technology.
592103	593163	It is an awesome idea.
593483	594184	And this is the cool thing.
594204	597245	You're going to be able to download demos onto your DS.
597626	608271	So if you ever walked into like a GameStop and you've been wanting to play the demo that's there but some damn seven-year-old kid's been sitting on there for the past two hours while his mom's in Victoria's Secret or something and left her kid in GameStop.
609352	611633	And you've been wanting to play the demo but the damn kid won't get off.
611693	613334	Well now you won't have to worry about that stuff anymore.
613574	618497	You just download the DS demo right onto your DS and you could just walk out the store and play it in the food court.
619105	621728	As long as you don't turn your DS off, you can still have that demo.
622268	625572	They actually sort of did that with the GBA, like in Animal Crossing.
626233	626753	Kind of, yeah.
626833	632960	You could play the game on your GBA, but if you turned it off, you lost it of course.
633188	635349	And that's probably where this idea started to stem from.
635409	638269	Because, unfortunately, you had to have the GameCube and the wire and everything.
638509	640290	But now that we got Bluetooth and wireless, hey.
640310	654093	Well, that is also, from what I hear, that's what they're doing with the Nintendo Revolution system, the brand new console system that they're going to be unveiling, is the connectivity with that is going to be similar to what the Advance was with the GameCube.
654313	655513	I would be shocked.
655794	661455	I would be absolutely shocked if the Revolution did not have some type of Bluetooth...
662342	663924	All their controllers are wireless.
663944	664925	They're all going to be wireless.
664945	666126	Well, that's not a bad idea either, honestly.
666166	667867	It's time for that to happen too.
667887	669789	So we can lose the controllers right along with the remotes, honestly.
669809	672071	It's time for that to start happening.
689524	693188	What's also interesting is the game Jam with the Band.
693488	694910	There's this game they have in Japan.
694930	695870	They don't have it here yet.
695910	698273	I don't remember if they have plans to bring this over here yet or not.
698613	703638	But you can actually download additional music for this game via the kiosks.
703978	706621	And it saves to your DS somehow.
706661	711586	And I never knew the DS had a type of drive in it, but it must have some type of memory flash or something because...
712046	713888	The information will actually save.
714209	718013	But I guess if you think about it, Loki, aren't the games just on flashcards anyway?
718433	722818	So maybe when you're downloading the information, it's going right onto the game?
723078	724199	I have no idea how that works.
724700	725821	Enlighten me, TechMassa.
726822	727263	I have no idea.
727283	727603	I'm sorry.
727643	729245	I'm being distracted by Tekken 5 here.
729385	730266	Okay, we're going to turn that off.
730406	731067	That's alright.
731548	731828	Alright.
732665	735166	Well, then I suppose we will get into Tekken 5 news.
735186	736146	Let's talk about Tekken 5.
736466	737687	Tekken 5 is out.
738467	741068	It really just kind of came out in the middle of nowhere.
741428	743148	Like, I remember mentioning it.
743328	744489	It came out Friday.
745089	748370	But really, it was like, dang, all of a sudden Tekken 5's out.
748690	750790	And here's the crazy thing about Tekken 5.
751891	755712	It's got Tekken 1, 2, and 3 all in it.
756052	758413	And, and, and, and Starblade.
759213	760253	That's so cool.
761254	761874	You know how...
762887	783236	I think it was Tekken, the first Tekken or Tekken 2 had like a Galaga Yeah For the loading game That's right This one has freaking Starblade as the loading game Talk about a step up there That's pretty cool Ridge Racer had Galaga Huh But a lot of the Namco games had loading games
783726	784307	Interesting.
784447	786468	Now, have you gotten a chance to play much Tekken 5 at all yet?
787309	789551	I unwrapped it before we walked out of the door, literally.
789771	790232	Gotcha.
790352	792774	So you haven't really had a chance to, but you played the arcade version.
793294	794656	Yeah, I played it in Alabama.
795536	804845	The only arcades in my hometown are Namco arcades, unless you count Ground Zero, and that's just privately owned.
805505	810850	But the first thing I did was make a beeline to Tekken 5, because Tekken 5 had just recently come out.
811368	815149	in California, but it had been out at all the Namco arcades ages ago.
815690	816630	So no one was there.
816670	818151	I got to play it as much as I wanted to.
819931	820352	Very cool.
821872	825053	Okay, so I'm looking forward to playing this game.
825073	827814	I'll give you a full review on Tekken 5 as soon as I can.
827994	828415	Next week.
828575	829395	Next week, yes.
829575	830355	Loki and I will both.
830976	832536	We will duel to the death on Tekken 5.
832676	834397	I suck at Tekken, so that'll be great.
835035	836116	I get to own you both.
836236	837497	I'm not that great at Tekken.
837517	839418	Jamie will kick both our asses, honestly.
839819	842921	I like Huarong because he has this really cheap move I always do with him.
843221	843822	Is he in Tekken 5?
844282	844482	Yes.
844622	845122	Oh, he better be.
845223	845423	Good.
845523	845763	Yay.
845923	846223	I'm saved.
846243	848005	And, of course, my man Gene is in there.
849205	852428	You can tell I'm such a Tekken 5 noob and I have not touched the arcade version yet.
852448	854890	But, seriously, every time I want to go play in the arcade, huge line.
854970	855290	Huge.
856911	857631	I have my card.
857651	859673	I haven't been able to use it since I came back in the States.
860662	870729	It kind of doesn't seem like there was much time between the arcade release and the home release, but I guess what you're saying about the Namco... I remember the little movie at E3, and then, bam, arcade, whoa.
870769	872691	Bam, arcade, and then, bam, home version.
872771	873391	It's like, yeesh.
875173	875493	All right.
876654	880037	Let's go ahead and move on to one other quick story.
880217	881498	Very interesting announcement.
881538	884840	We've had something Nintendo and something Sony with Tekken.
884860	886882	Now let's get to something Xbox, Microsoft.
887975	898700	Hironobu Sakaguchi has joined up with Microsoft to develop role playing game video games exclusively for the upcoming next gen Xbox system.
898780	900201	Why is this such a big deal?
900641	905644	Well, if you didn't recognize the name, Sakaguchi is the creator of the Final Fantasy franchise.
907104	907805	Very interesting.
907905	908505	Good for them.
908825	911426	I'd like to see them expand on games like Fable.
913748	916549	The Xbox needs some
917663	937349	like different variety kinds of games I think I think Fable was a good place for the Xbox to go despite how you might feel about that game it was kind of like what is the Xbox really freaking lacking oh a good RPG well finally you get Fable way later so I think this is a good direction for Microsoft to be looking into so just my thought I don't know any other thoughts from you guys
939266	964141	I could definitely hopefully they're gonna be making some good games maybe an online game I would hope for an online game I don't know about MMO because I'm kind of headed up to here with MMOs but I don't know I guess that's where the money's at right I'll wait and see wait and see all right now of course we here at Orange Lounge Radio we're not just here to fill you in on all the video game news that doesn't suck but we're here to better your lives as well
964979	969021	What better way to do that than allow Jamie to give you her advice column.
969061	977764	So, DarkSakura, turn that anger that you usually have on our three-hour program at OrangeLaunchRadio.com and turn it into a little bit of love for our listeners.
982646	987027	I swear to you people, I give you good advice and you never follow it.
987307	989248	Did someone fail a lie detector test last week?
990242	991043	I guess so.
991563	992804	We have a bunch of liars listening.
992824	994886	Yes, and his name is Mr. Jackson.
996627	1000490	Today's advice is how to get to the surface if your scuba tank runs out of air.
1001771	1004834	Number one, signal to your fellow divers that you are having a problem.
1004894	1006315	Point to your tank or regulator.
1007416	1009718	Now that's just common sense, Jamie.
1010719	1011819	Alright, I need to hear the other steps.
1011900	1012360	Number two,
1013078	1018020	If someone comes to your aid, share his or her regulator passing it back and forth while swimming slowly to the surface.
1019001	1018020	3.
1019441	1024043	If no one can help you, keep your regulator in your mouth as air may expand in the tank as you ascend.
1024463	1027045	Look straight up so that your airway is as straight as possible.
1027065	1027045	4.
1030486	1033388	Swim to the surface at a moderate rate.
1033588	1038810	Exhale continuously as you swim up, but do not exhaust all of your air in the first few seconds of your ascent.
1039331	1042132	If you do not exhale continuously, you risk an aneurysm.
1044998	1048339	And another bit of the thing to add to that, just don't go scuba diving.
1053720	1058381	If people were meant to swim that deep, they'd have gills, like in Waterworld.
1060181	1063981	Or if you go scuba diving, go down like maybe 20 feet at the most.
1064181	1064782	Use a snorkel.
1064942	1066642	Did you actually see the Waterworld movie?
1066722	1066842	No.
1066902	1067462	Oh, okay.
1067982	1068662	I know they had gills.
1070062	1070743	I know it sucked.
1071743	1072863	Kevin Costner, of course.
1073669	1078411	I know I just made a comment about not wanting to talk about MMOs, but I had to mention this one.
1079812	1090216	Anarchy Online players will soon be seeing advertisements on billboards that are stationed in central regions of the game's landscape.
1090896	1099640	They're teaming up with New York City-based Massive, the folks that create Anarchy Online, and they are going to be putting ads inside the game.
1100120	1102041	What do you think about ads in MMOs?
1103143	1105804	I hear, though, the game's gonna go free, I think.
1105884	1128895	I guess, now, that would make sense, why there's ads in it, I suppose, but seriously, after the news that we got about the Slash Pizza in EverQuest 2 last week with the Pizza Hut, I mean, this is a totally obvious... To be honest, I mean, in a game like that, I don't really, I haven't ever played Anarchy Online, but if it's on billboards or something, I really don't see that deterring away from the game really that much.
1129475	1129735	I mean...
1130703	1133444	If it were in Final Fantasy XI, though, that would totally detract.
1133584	1135645	Yeah, that would make more sense.
1136166	1144810	I can't wait for the day when I go into one of my Burning Circle Notorious Monster Battles and it's like, Pepsi presents the Burning Circle Battle!
1145250	1148492	Britney Spears coming out singing a song, and then you get to attack the monster.
1148572	1149792	Who is Britney Spears, actually?
1149952	1154995	I can understand something like that, say, in Matrix Online, where you're going to have billboards and ads.
1155595	1158036	In that type of environment, something like that would make sense.
1158156	1159217	That would actually be
1160140	1163942	PowerAid, just like in the game.
1165683	1170686	That would actually be a good way to get a little bit of extra money in there.
1171306	1174308	I wouldn't see it in Ragnarok Online.
1175809	1186434	To be honest, if they're going to put ads in a game and then they're going to say, I don't know, make it free or reduce the fees it's going to cost every month, of course you're going to get people that are going to be like, fuck that, I don't care.
1186535	1187335	Hey, as long as I don't...
1188361	1191942	As long as it's not pop-ups, because I fucking hate pop-ups.
1192002	1193423	Well, that's going to deter from the game.
1194363	1196664	It's all about gameplay and these things.
1197064	1202626	Otherwise, you're going to get people not going to shell out the 20 bucks or whatever it is a month to play these things.
1203246	1205867	So, why not?
1206228	1207348	I don't see a problem with it.
1207588	1212050	And Anarchy Online seems like, to me, it's a pretty dynamic game as it is.
1212610	1214250	Pretty futuristic and stuff.
1214290	1215651	So, I guess it could fit.
1216317	1217438	You know, and a few billboards.
1217478	1217918	Who cares?
1217978	1222082	You know, whether it be some generic thing that doesn't exist or an actual product, who cares?
1222682	1224884	I mean, it doesn't detract from the game that much.
1224944	1227306	And even if they have like, you know, what is it?
1227366	1233090	Like maybe even vending machines or something that we're like strewn about, you know, or other crap, you know, product placement and stuff.
1233491	1234331	It really doesn't matter.
1234451	1237454	How about like in Duke Nukem 3D where I could blow those vending machines up?
1238368	1239028	I don't like this ad!
1239048	1241070	We shall see how far they take this idea, because...
1263473	1265054	Anything they can advertise on, they'll do it.
1265074	1269895	I'm still waiting for my slash pizza and slash porn, but, you know, no luck yet.
1270455	1270795	All right.
1271615	1272596	Back to Nintendo.
1272656	1279658	They're going to be releasing a whole lot of titles in May, including Pokemon Emerald and Fire Emblem, the Sacred Stones.
1280298	1284339	Also coming out in May, Donkey Konga 2 and Geist.
1285459	1288100	And any of those games going to be on the DS?
1288120	1288460	Yes.
1289244	1298226	Actually, no, they are all being released for the... Not Pokemon... I'm sorry, Pokemon Emerald and Fire Emblem, of course, are Game Boy Advance titles.
1298706	1300906	Donkey Konga 2 and Geist, GameCube titles.
1301286	1303487	Shocking, no DS titles.
1303927	1306207	Wow, only one in February.
1306727	1311988	Gee, I don't think the PSP is going to blow them out of the water when it fucking gets released.
1312568	1313729	You mean the Great Game Shooter?
1314169	1315309	Yes, the Great Game Shooter.
1316400	1321070	Pokemon Emerald, of course, being the next saga in the... It's another Pokemon game.
1321110	1321951	What else do I need to say?
1322032	1323174	It's another freaking Pokemon game.
1324919	1330182	You know, I remember another console system a while back that actually had pretty good graphics but no games for it.
1330463	1332424	I don't know if anyone remembers the Atari Lynx.
1333004	1333444	Oh, yes.
1333665	1334805	Dude, we've got a Lynx.
1334845	1336406	We have a bunch of games for it, too.
1336426	1337367	You have everything.
1337407	1339608	Just because you own it doesn't mean it was successful.
1339668	1340409	You have everything.
1340449	1345152	The Lynx was awesome, and it had that great commercial where the kids snuck out of class to sit in the bathroom to play it.
1345372	1347053	And the Lynx had Tempest 2000, which was rad.
1347073	1350075	My point being, though, is that if they... Oh, no, never mind.
1350595	1353477	I'm getting the Lynx... No, I'm getting the Lynx mixed up with the Jaguar.
1353993	1356894	That's... See, that's how much I played these systems.
1357514	1357715	What?
1359835	1363537	If I had a ruler and was a nun, you'd be in trouble.
1363617	1364077	Whatever.
1364377	1370079	The point being is the fact that they have the lack of games is going to kill that system, sadly enough.
1370840	1376742	They really need to get on the ball here with getting even third-party... But it can play the Advance games.
1376802	1377863	You need the Pac-Man Marvel Advance game.
1377883	1378283	Oh, goody.
1378543	1378943	Guess what?
1379003	1381704	The Game Boy Advance can play the Game Boy games.
1382124	1382765	But you know what?
1382825	1383705	That doesn't matter.
1385464	1387305	We need Marble Madness.
1388206	1388787	Damn straight.
1388807	1389727	And Crystal Castles.
1390668	1392630	Using the stylus as a trackball.
1392990	1395732	That would be a good idea for Atari or somebody to put out.
1395792	1396793	I believe they're doing that.
1396933	1397173	Good.
1397533	1399615	Smart people.
1399715	1405659	Fire Emblem, of course, is the long-running strategy RPG series, and it'll have new characters, yada yada.
1405700	1409102	Donkey Konga's the game with the bongos, you know, music game, lots of fun.
1409663	1410143	Geist.
1410623	1414046	You will be in the role of a ghost who possesses people.
1415216	1415617	Fire Emblem Wind
1427225	1428186	Thanks for watching!
1446917	1447977	Little piece of news here.
1448517	1452959	The Fable soundtrack is coming out, or it just came out recently.
1453399	1456380	And it has the Fable theme, which was created by Danny Elfman.
1456400	1457780	Of course, you know, oingo boingo.
1459600	1464922	And it's being released by Something Else, S-U-M, Something Else Studios.
1465002	1469063	And it has a lot of the score as well by Russell Shaw, which kind of makes me think...
1470046	1472347	Why the hell don't more video games get soundtrack releases?
1472747	1473128	Seriously.
1473148	1475069	They do in Japan, just about every game that comes out.
1475109	1479411	Well, sure, in Japan, but I'm talking about America, so I don't have to pay... It's happening more often.
1480351	1485334	But for games like Fable, what about games like DDR getting full soundtracks?
1485374	1489896	I guess they have the VRairs, I guess, but there's other games with great soundtracks as well.
1490256	1492177	Katamari Damacy, hello.
1492557	1493898	Yeah, that had great music.
1494158	1496039	Where's the domestic soundtrack release?
1496059	1497640	Although, I know that...
1499329	1516301	of course the soundtrack will probably cost as much as the game but hey well there are games that did come out that they put soundtracks out for like I have to think about it actually it's sad you know what they could do well for all of the
1518385	1519326	Grand Theft Auto games.
1519486	1519746	Yeah.
1520006	1520926	You know what they could do, though?
1521427	1527450	Why don't they just release Katamari Damacy Special Edition, including the soundtrack and a poster.
1527850	1528230	Sell it for $30.
1528290	1529291	There you go.
1529351	1529631	Guess what?
1529651	1531052	You made your money and you sold the game again.
1531192	1531872	That's so Nintendo.
1531912	1533813	I could do it in Korea and include an umbrella.
1534314	1535714	Because you know what?
1535734	1537695	People out there are buying Special Editions.
1537735	1540437	That's a brand new thing now that they're doing with all these games that are coming out.
1540537	1541718	Tekken 5 Special Edition, $100.
1542498	1542978	Exactly.
1543158	1544679	And it's just that's the thing.
1545640	1547761	If you want your soundtrack, put it in the Special Edition.
1548379	1549239	That's the way to do it.
1551400	1551781	All right.
1551841	1553882	That's going to wrap it up for tonight's podcast.
1553962	1557443	Thank you guys very much for downloading us and staying loyal to our show.
1557463	1558384	We appreciate it.
1558704	1560304	Jamie, any parting words for our listeners tonight?
1561945	1562145	Al.
1563246	1563546	Loki.
1564426	1570669	Altercade trying to copyright MAME is bad.
1571249	1574391	Do not play Altercade and fight this to the death.
1575490	1579751	Not only is it bad, but it's stupid, and they have no legal grounds.
1580131	1582852	It's so bad, it should have its own word.
1582952	1584973	It's like bad wrong, or badong.
1586753	1588754	Sorry, that's a Kung Pao reference there.
1589754	1594876	And my final thought, I guess, would be, thou shalt kick an Ultracade machine when you see it.
1596296	1597457	Have a great one, everybody.
1597657	1598557	We'll see you next time.
