happy lip you shut up all right let's get into uh video game news that doesn't suck well and

01:18.700 --> 01:23.020
maybe it's some sucky news but we'll see uh dark sacra what have you been playing this week what

01:23.020 --> 01:25.740
What have been into I guess I should say what even playing for the past two weeks

01:28.140 --> 01:30.540
Wow what a fun game only $49.95

01:38.900 --> 01:46.060
Okay, sounds good. We'll go over to Loki. What do you been playing this week? I've been playing my computers broken. What happened

01:46.060 --> 01:48.940
I think the power supply went out

01:48.940 --> 01:55.640
Uh, all I know is the power supply was very fucking hot, and I shut off the compu- well,

01:55.640 --> 02:01.220
I was running through town as my mule in Final Fantasy XI and I was like pew, off.

02:01.220 --> 02:04.760
Did your computer finally just decide to tell you, look buddy, you play too much of this

02:04.760 --> 02:06.600
damn game, you need a break?

02:06.600 --> 02:10.880
No, it, I think it's the power supply because it's, it was literally really hot.

02:10.880 --> 02:15.700
I mean, I, I was touching the case and the case was actually burning my fingers, I mean,

02:15.700 --> 02:22.020
That's not usually a good sign if that's happening, and I think the power supply is just shot.

02:22.020 --> 02:26.900
Could be all the dust that was in there, it just might have stopped the fan and then the

02:26.900 --> 02:29.300
power supply overheated and just died.

02:29.300 --> 02:32.280
So I got by a new power supply and that sucks.

02:32.280 --> 02:38.220
Before that, I was playing Final Fantasy XI, a little bit of Matrix online, and when I

02:38.220 --> 02:42.580
say a little bit of Matrix online, I cannot stress how little I've been playing.

02:42.580 --> 02:49.580
I played through the tutorial again and got bored with it again and then um what else

02:49.580 --> 02:57.580
did I do um I was playing this stupid game that was like it was another freeware game

02:57.580 --> 03:03.860
where you launch gnomes into the air and you like see how far you can get them to fly and

03:03.860 --> 03:09.740
I don't know that was amusing for about five minutes and then uh that's about all I've

03:09.740 --> 03:12.440
have been playing I'm gonna actually start getting into some more console

03:12.440 --> 03:16.940
games this week since my computer's down so now heaven forbid yeah you might have

03:16.940 --> 03:20.800
to play some console games this week what are you gonna do well I'm hopefully

03:20.800 --> 03:25.000
gonna get my Grand Theft Auto San Andreas back because I want to play that

03:25.000 --> 03:33.400
but if not I guess shutter I guess I could start and play through maybe with

03:33.400 --> 03:37.720
cheating of course because I can't play these games legitimately Final Fantasy X

03:37.720 --> 03:46.800
two oh my gosh 10 all right yes we this was a big issue a while back on the

03:46.800 --> 03:51.140
three-hour program that we do over at orange lounge radio.com we actually

03:51.140 --> 03:54.580
wrote squeamix we wrote them an email and said you need to tell us how this is

03:54.580 --> 03:59.320
pronounced is it X 2 or 10 2 because this is a huge argument between Jamie

03:59.320 --> 04:05.440
and our chat room and turns out Jamie was right oh it's 10 2 which it's so

04:05.440 --> 04:10.400
silly though it's 10-2 but I mean it makes sense at the same time. What can you call this Final Fantasy X-I?

04:10.400 --> 04:18.400
Sometimes I call it FFXI for sure. There are too damn many Taro Taro on my screen. Anyway, Jamie

04:18.400 --> 04:22.320
are y'all cleaned up all better? Yeah I was playing Final Fantasy 11. This week that's all you've been

04:22.320 --> 04:29.480
playing this week? In Silent Hill 3. Oh in Silent Hill 3. And Super Punch-Out. Right on Super Punch-Out. Hey you

04:29.480 --> 04:33.280
know what Super Punch-Out if I remember right it kind of came out towards the end of the Super

04:33.280 --> 04:38.240
Nintendo it was kind of overlooked it feels like it seems like not a lot of

04:38.240 --> 04:41.880
people knew about super punch how everybody knew Mike Tyson's punch out

04:41.880 --> 04:47.980
maybe it's just my neck of the woods gratis 3 good choice which is like the

04:47.980 --> 04:54.080
only version I think that with Dan and I could be what what possessed you to get

04:54.080 --> 05:00.000
into Silent Hill 3 as opposed to for other me okay and actually the Xbox

05:00.000 --> 05:05.480
wasn't hooked up it's just it's as simple as that sometimes yeah that was

05:05.480 --> 05:11.200
it that's for games I've been playing this week WarioWare touched I went out

05:11.200 --> 05:15.680
and got Tuesday the day came out I loved the WarioWare original on Game Boy

05:15.680 --> 05:21.880
Advance wasn't such a fan of the one on Game Boy or Game Boy GameCube because

05:21.880 --> 05:25.840
the problem with it for me is it was just a rehashed version of the same

05:25.840 --> 05:29.480
thing I'd already played and not that it was necessarily a bad game per se

05:29.480 --> 05:34.640
because the multiplayer stuff was hilarious, but I just got really annoyed that I fell

05:34.640 --> 05:40.080
into that Nintendo trap of buying the same thing, just a little bit better, a little

05:40.080 --> 05:45.360
newer, so it made me mad and I only played it a couple times. But now, WarioWare Touched

05:45.360 --> 05:50.920
is out and it's not a rehashed version, it's got like 180 new games, it's awesome. The

05:50.920 --> 05:55.380
only thing that kind of bugged me about it is that I played it so much that I pretty

05:55.380 --> 05:59.300
much unlocked everything after just two days of sitting down with it for a couple hours

05:59.300 --> 06:03.940
and playing it so I kind of I've got one thing left to unlock and that's the one

06:03.940 --> 06:07.900
where you've got to go play everything every little game and get the scores it's

06:07.900 --> 06:12.540
gonna take me forever but I do love WarioWare and it's just so cool with the

06:12.540 --> 06:16.180
pen it's a little weird because they have microphone games mixed in now and

06:16.180 --> 06:20.580
every microphone game is some type of blowing so it's like draw draw draw draw

06:20.580 --> 06:26.060
draw draw it's kind of WarioWare but hey if you like the original WarioWare if

06:26.060 --> 06:30.620
If you like Feel the Magic XXXY, very similar, you'll like WarioWare Touched.

06:30.620 --> 06:32.620
I like the Parrot.

06:32.620 --> 06:34.620
Yeah, the Parrot minigame is very cool.

06:34.620 --> 06:38.700
Because we couldn't get to work at first, but then we finally did, and that was the best.

06:38.700 --> 06:41.180
Some of the unlocks are so weird.

06:41.180 --> 06:43.500
Like, the original WarioWare had some awesome unlocks.

06:43.500 --> 06:46.220
Like, it had Dr. Wario that you could get in it,

06:46.220 --> 06:53.260
and it had the little game you got with the little bird that would eat the things that fall down from the sky.

06:53.260 --> 06:59.260
WarioWare Touch doesn't have quite the same cool unlocks. Like, you can unlock a calculator.

06:59.260 --> 07:05.260
You can unlock a fortune teller. You can unlock a yo-yo.

07:05.260 --> 07:07.260
What was the gelatin thing?

07:07.260 --> 07:12.260
Yeah, one of the unlocks is a piece of jello. It's the custard game.

07:12.260 --> 07:17.260
And all you do is you poke it with your stylus and it goes boing-boing-boing-boing when you poke it with the stylus.

07:17.260 --> 07:20.260
That's all it is. It's crazy.

07:20.260 --> 07:22.300
But that's the kind of thing you come to expect from WarioWare.

07:22.300 --> 07:23.860
So it's all good.

07:23.860 --> 07:26.780
All right, let's get into some news that's going on this week.

07:26.780 --> 07:28.660
Jamie was mentioning about Xbox.

07:28.660 --> 07:30.840
So this is certainly important to announce.

07:30.840 --> 07:33.860
Check the date on the bottom of your Xbox to see when it was

07:33.860 --> 07:38.420
manufactured, because if it was pre-October 2003,

07:38.420 --> 07:42.100
specifically October 23, 2003, you're entitled to a power

07:42.100 --> 07:43.060
cord replacement.

07:43.060 --> 07:45.260
Check out Xbox.com for the details.

07:45.260 --> 07:49.780
But apparently, the old power cord was causing some Xboxes

07:49.780 --> 07:57.940
overheat and possibly catch fire careful so we we checked the the date on mine

07:57.940 --> 08:02.020
and luckily it was in 2004 so I'm okay which is good because I'm lazy and I

08:02.020 --> 08:05.420
probably never call the claim I might need to replace yet one for the orange

08:05.420 --> 08:13.580
box because oh wait so check it out you may be eligible for this xbox.com for

08:13.580 --> 08:17.620
more information since you guys love to talk about Final Fantasy 11 and hey I do

08:17.620 --> 08:22.520
do too. It's only natural that we mention this about Final Fantasy XII. Fans that are

08:22.520 --> 08:27.320
eager to get their hands on Final Fantasy XII may have to keep waiting. It may not be

08:27.320 --> 08:34.160
released in the spring of 2005 as it was previously anticipated. However on the bright side, Squeenix

08:34.160 --> 08:39.580
is trying to release a new game every month starting April 1st. April 1st being the two

08:39.580 --> 08:47.300
year anniversary of when Square and Enix merged, or as we lovingly call them, Squeenix.

08:47.300 --> 08:52.000
So we're gonna see it at E3 this year again, it sounds like, which is kinda weird.

08:52.000 --> 08:58.220
It has then been brought to my attention that it's supposed to be Squenix, because the CEO

08:58.220 --> 09:00.860
of Enix actually said Enix.

09:00.860 --> 09:05.120
Right, and that's fine, calling it Squenix, but I like Squee, like Squee!

09:05.120 --> 09:07.440
So we call it Squenix.

09:07.440 --> 09:14.200
I know it's not supposed to be Squenix, but you know, who calls it Squenix?

09:14.200 --> 09:19.400
Asian girl in the commercial. This is an exciting story

09:19.400 --> 09:23.320
for those you guys that are fans of Mario Kart. They're making an arcade

09:23.320 --> 09:24.760
version of Mario Kart.

09:24.760 --> 09:28.400
Don't get too excited, it's only announced for Japanese arcades right now

09:28.400 --> 09:29.520
but then again

09:29.520 --> 09:33.400
F-Zero AX was only supposed to be in Japanese arcades at first and it did end

09:33.400 --> 09:36.800
up coming to America albeit very limited release because the machines were very

09:36.800 --> 09:37.480
expensive.

09:37.480 --> 09:41.800
But Mario Kart is coming to Japanese arcades. Here's the weird thing though.

09:41.800 --> 09:49.080
It's using the Triforce system, which is Nintendo, Namco, and Sega.

09:49.080 --> 09:54.380
Now they haven't said anything about what Sega's involvement is with this game necessarily,

09:54.380 --> 10:00.080
but Namco sure as heck is involved because Ms. Pac-Man and Pac-Man and Blinky are all

10:00.080 --> 10:01.660
going to have their own carts.

10:01.660 --> 10:04.040
So you can race Mario versus Pac-Man.

10:04.040 --> 10:07.480
And we were kind of talking about this earlier on the three hour show.

10:07.480 --> 10:11.440
What if you could play a Sonic or some of the Sega characters?

10:11.440 --> 10:13.840
I still hope that Sonic doesn't get a car.

10:13.840 --> 10:15.760
Yeah, Sonic would just run alongside him.

10:15.760 --> 10:17.720
They also need Mappy.

10:17.720 --> 10:19.920
That would be cool, Mappy from Namco.

10:19.920 --> 10:22.040
And Nights needs to be in it, but Nights needs to fly.

10:22.040 --> 10:24.680
And the dude from Katamari Damacy, the prince.

10:24.680 --> 10:26.800
Yeah, he needs to roll a Katamari.

10:26.800 --> 10:28.800
You know they're gonna have all these inside jokes

10:28.800 --> 10:29.900
in the background and stuff.

10:29.900 --> 10:30.840
Anyway, that's very exciting.

10:30.840 --> 10:32.680
It's gonna use the card system as well.

10:32.680 --> 10:35.800
You know the, like, Initial D and F-Zero AX had?

10:35.800 --> 10:38.480
The little magnetic card that you can use in the game?

10:38.480 --> 10:39.960
This is gonna have that as well.

10:39.960 --> 10:43.480
so very exciting news keep your fingers crossed that this stuff comes over to

10:43.480 --> 10:45.440
america cuz I bet it'll be a big hit

10:45.440 --> 10:48.780
even though I don't know if it's just me but arcades

10:48.780 --> 10:52.760
just not as cool as they used to be. It's a bunch of ticket eaters now

10:52.760 --> 10:56.760
you know what they need to make another game like star blade was with the giant

10:56.760 --> 10:57.760
rotating machine

10:57.760 --> 11:01.200
cool they need to

11:01.200 --> 11:05.160
something else for me to if I'm gonna pay 75 cents or

11:05.160 --> 11:08.480
a dollar a game I want the machine to move with me in it

11:08.480 --> 11:11.060
How about just another Dragon's Lair?

11:11.060 --> 11:12.060
Those games are cool.

11:12.060 --> 11:13.060
We do need another game like that.

11:13.060 --> 11:16.140
How about an arcade version caught the Mario Damacy with a trackball?

11:16.140 --> 11:18.740
That'd be cool.

11:18.740 --> 11:20.580
A giant trackball.

11:20.580 --> 11:21.580
Yes.

11:21.580 --> 11:26.220
Here's a game that's been at an arcades recently and it's coming to the console very soon.

11:26.220 --> 11:29.100
Tekken 5 is coming out February 25th.

11:29.100 --> 11:34.060
It's the first game that's been released since, of course, Tekken 4 in the Tekken series,

11:34.060 --> 11:38.060
but that was back in 2002, so this is the first one we've had in a while.

11:38.060 --> 11:46.060
gonna sell for $49.99. Of course there's going to be a premium set that comes

11:46.060 --> 11:50.480
with a special controller designed specifically for Tekken 5 and a Tekken

11:50.480 --> 12:01.140
themed 6 disc DVD case $99.99 if you want that. So, hmm, PlayStation 2 February 25th.

12:01.140 --> 12:06.460
I know you were a big Tekken girl, Dark Sakura. I love Tekken. Any thoughts on Tekken 5?

12:06.460 --> 12:07.460
Are you excited about this?

12:07.460 --> 12:12.420
I'm so happy, and then once the game comes out, I get the poster at Dan's Game Stop to

12:12.420 --> 12:13.420
put in my cubicle.

12:13.420 --> 12:14.420
You just want the free stuff.

12:14.420 --> 12:17.660
Dude, it's coming with, um, the first three!

12:17.660 --> 12:18.660
Alright.

12:18.660 --> 12:23.860
So, how can you go wrong with that, having arcade perfect versions at home?

12:23.860 --> 12:29.860
Instead of having to use our, uh, um, the main cabinet?

12:29.860 --> 12:31.780
How does the Tekken 5 cards work?

12:31.780 --> 12:35.340
I mean, this may sound like such a dumb question, but I never really got into the Tekken games,

12:35.340 --> 12:38.980
especially in the arcades, because the people in the arcades are scary good and I cannot

12:38.980 --> 12:43.180
waste money playing them, they will school me 11 ways from Tuesday.

12:43.180 --> 12:48.760
You can, um, put it, you buy the card, you choose a character and you raise your character

12:48.760 --> 12:53.920
on that card. You can actually accessorize them, get them like hats and different outfits

12:53.920 --> 13:00.500
and things. So it's Barbie Tekken. Sort of. But you also save your improvements that you

13:00.500 --> 13:02.500
make with the character too.

13:02.500 --> 13:08.060
Alright, speaking of improvements, Orange Lounge Radio To Go is here to better your

13:08.060 --> 13:14.700
life and what way to do it better than Dark Sakura and her advice column.

13:14.700 --> 13:22.300
Her piece of advice for the week to help make your life a little bit better.

13:22.300 --> 13:27.880
Alright and she's going to be giving that to us and she missed out on last week so it

13:27.880 --> 13:29.620
has to be twice as good this week.

13:29.620 --> 13:36.620
Today's advice is how to fool a lie detector test, which everyone needs to know in case you're ever arrested.

13:36.620 --> 13:44.620
Number one. Examiners will administer a pre-test before the actual polygraph to create a baseline of reactions.

13:44.620 --> 13:51.620
During the pre-test, force yourself to breathe faster than normal and display confidence. Never appear nervous or shy.

13:51.620 --> 13:56.620
Number two. Maintain eye contact with the examiner. Do not fidget.

13:56.620 --> 14:03.620
Do not, however, sit completely still. Move something subtly but regularly. Your toes, your fingers, hips, etc.

14:03.620 --> 14:10.620
3. Do not try to anticipate the questions you will be asked. Think positive and relaxing thoughts.

14:10.620 --> 14:19.620
4. When answering control questions truthfully, bite your tongue slightly.

14:19.620 --> 14:24.300
This hopefully will give a false reading. Examiners may find it impossible to

14:24.300 --> 14:28.620
decipher your test because the readings are inconsistent, as in they show stress

14:28.620 --> 14:33.380
both when you're answering truthfully and when you could be lying. A little bit of

14:33.380 --> 14:38.340
trivia about the polygraph. Interesting. The guy who created the polygraph is

14:38.340 --> 14:45.840
also the creator of Wonder Woman. No way! And her golden lasso is a tribute to the

14:45.840 --> 14:51.200
an eye detector. Wow, you learn something new every day. Yeah. This program being no

14:51.200 --> 14:59.120
exception. Interesting, so. He was also into bondage and SNM. Thanks for sharing. You know,

14:59.120 --> 15:07.280
that explains a lot about Wonder Woman. It really, really does. Yep. Wow. Um, this is

15:07.280 --> 15:11.480
interesting because apparently what's going on right now is there's a new bill going around

15:11.480 --> 15:17.320
California legislature legislation right now where they are trying to pass a new

15:17.320 --> 15:21.320
bill that will limit the sales of M rated games to minors in other words

15:21.320 --> 15:26.560
it's gonna make it illegal to sell M rated games to minors what do you guys

15:26.560 --> 15:30.640
think about this the games are intended for people over the age of 17 anyway so

15:30.640 --> 15:36.080
I don't see why that's a problem is this is this an excuse for lazy parenting

15:36.080 --> 15:43.340
though? Yes. As I always say, parents need to do their job. Don't rely on the

15:43.340 --> 15:48.140
government to do your job for you. I'm okay with this law and all. I don't think

15:48.140 --> 15:53.940
it's such a bad thing, but I think it's kind of an excuse in a way, you know. Why

15:53.940 --> 15:56.900
aren't the parents being more involved? The parents should know what games. Who's

15:56.900 --> 16:00.980
giving the money to the kids? Because if you're under 17, chances are you don't

16:00.980 --> 16:04.700
have a job. Maybe you do. Maybe you do. And if that's the case, they're probably

16:04.700 --> 16:08.660
also old enough to know what games are good for you and what games aren't so my

16:08.660 --> 16:12.260
question is if the parents are giving the kids the money shouldn't the parents

16:12.260 --> 16:18.580
know where the money's going I don't get it but I'm okay with the bill I mean

16:18.580 --> 16:22.900
whatever if you have any feedback you can email us to go at orange launch

16:22.900 --> 16:26.940
radio comm anything that has to do with what you hear on the orange launch radio

16:26.940 --> 16:33.300
to go edition again that's to go to go at orange launch radio comm think of

16:33.300 --> 16:40.480
Togo and Slana. Exactly. And then think of us. Exactly. Some other interesting

16:40.480 --> 16:44.400
announcements going on this week, Midway sent out a press release that they are

16:44.400 --> 16:48.680
reviving the Gauntlet series. They're gonna be releasing a game called Gauntlet

16:48.680 --> 16:54.360
Seven Sorrows. Need game badly. Blending an intuitive combat system, accessible

16:54.360 --> 16:58.360
role-playing game elements, and new junction skills, Seven Sorrows features

16:58.360 --> 17:02.600
the dynamic co-op it's known for and for the first time ever, it is online

17:02.600 --> 17:07.400
supporting up to four players hmm so that's pretty cool seven sorrows is the

17:07.400 --> 17:11.080
fusion of fantasy fighting action with a strategy of user-friendly RPG elements

17:11.080 --> 17:14.800
providing gamers a deep engaging gameplay experience complete with solo

17:14.800 --> 17:19.120
play co-op and an online community the new fighting system allows for easy

17:19.120 --> 17:23.360
pickup and play while simultaneously offering deeper choices for more advanced

17:23.360 --> 17:26.760
players additionally online role-playing game and collection elements add

17:26.760 --> 17:30.360
significant replay value to the game not all coming from their press release

17:30.360 --> 17:34.960
remember don't shoot the food so basically this sounds like gauntlet

17:34.960 --> 17:39.880
legacy except you know now it's going to be online and I got to admit I wasn't

17:39.880 --> 17:45.800
all into gauntlet legacy I mean it was it was okay it was kind of Diablo to me

17:45.800 --> 17:52.120
but the original was just so good and then this new one comes along and I

17:52.120 --> 17:58.840
don't know it just seems repetitive granted the old one wasn't I don't know

17:58.840 --> 18:03.640
repetitive seemed to be okay back then I don't know how to explain it but gauntlet

18:03.640 --> 18:07.120
the original didn't feel quite as repetitive as legacy did but maybe it's

18:07.120 --> 18:11.480
just me maybe I didn't give the game a fair enough chance any thoughts you know

18:11.480 --> 18:19.040
I tried to get into it we played it at home a bit on the n64 but I wasn't even

18:19.040 --> 18:23.680
into field gauntlet I had it on Dreamcast I wasn't even into the old

18:23.680 --> 18:28.000
gauntlet at all I liked gauntlet 2 on NES how's my favorite Loki any thoughts

18:28.000 --> 18:35.200
on gauntlet I like gauntlet legends cuz I is always pojo pojo all the time I was

18:35.200 --> 18:40.320
a giant chicken walking around shooting fire was that like a code or something I

18:40.320 --> 18:43.560
never knew about that there was a code you could be pojo the entire time and

18:43.560 --> 18:51.480
that was I think it was egg and then 911 was the password oh boy

18:51.480 --> 18:57.040
interesting and also coming from Midway I think this is interesting they're

18:57.040 --> 19:01.000
They're going to be releasing Midway Arcade Treasures 3.

19:01.000 --> 19:04.700
So you know Midway Arcade Treasures has been doing very well, the series.

19:04.700 --> 19:08.540
They're put together really great, and if you're a fan of classic gaming at all, I highly

19:08.540 --> 19:14.880
recommend the games, Midway Arcade Classics 1 and 2, these treasure games.

19:14.880 --> 19:18.940
Now they're going to do a 3, but I'm a little weirded out by 3 because this is the deal

19:18.940 --> 19:20.220
with 3.

19:20.220 --> 19:24.360
It's only going to be, it's not going to be 20 games, it's only going to be 8 games because

19:24.360 --> 19:26.580
there's somewhat newer games in here.

19:26.580 --> 19:30.000
And here's the other weird thing, they're all racing games.

19:30.000 --> 19:35.540
You're gonna get Badlands, Hydro Thunder, Off-Road Thunder, Race Drivin', San Francisco

19:35.540 --> 19:42.560
Rush, San Francisco Rush 2049, Stun Runner, and Super Off-Road and the Bonus Tracks Pack.

19:42.560 --> 19:46.040
That sounds cool, that'd be best if it was Multi-Tap or something.

19:46.040 --> 19:52.360
Hydro Thunder was pretty cool, Off-Road Thunder was awesome, that game was pretty sweet, and

19:52.360 --> 19:56.440
San Francisco Rush and Rush 2049, those are pretty sweet.

19:56.440 --> 20:02.040
they didn't say Arctic Thunder did it? It did not. But it's all about Hydro Thunder

20:02.040 --> 20:06.600
because Dan and I on Dreamcast, we played Hydro Thunder like crazy and I used to go

20:06.600 --> 20:10.280
play it at the arcade all the time. Now see that's the thing that weirds me out about

20:10.280 --> 20:14.040
this is that I'm cool with all these games, they are great games, but for me they're great

20:14.040 --> 20:17.880
games in the arcade. There's so much of a difference between like actually sitting in

20:17.880 --> 20:21.980
the big Hydro Thunder cabinet and changing the gears and racing and that and having the

20:21.980 --> 20:26.260
the force feedback and everything, there's such a difference between that and the console

20:26.260 --> 20:31.260
experience to me, it's just not the same. I don't know, is it just me?

20:31.260 --> 20:39.940
It's a matter of opinion. I guess. Maybe. This will certainly be worth checking out,

20:39.940 --> 20:45.140
I enjoy Treasures 1 and 2 so much, but I think it's one of those things, to me this strikes

20:45.140 --> 20:49.920
me as something that Midway is just trying to continue to cash in on this Treasure success,

20:49.920 --> 20:54.520
they've released all their games now hopefully their port of San Francisco

20:54.520 --> 21:00.600
rush will be better than the PlayStation or the Nintendo 64 versions of that game

21:00.600 --> 21:04.040
well these should be hypothetically arcade perfect ports they should be

21:04.040 --> 21:09.500
just arcade emulated ports hypothetically well damn I want to see

21:09.500 --> 21:16.160
my copy of off-road thunder then for me because I download that shit of course

21:16.160 --> 21:23.160
of course all right moving on in video game news I thought this was way and I

21:23.160 --> 21:26.840
think this is a good one for us to close on tonight this story was just far too

21:26.840 --> 21:31.560
interesting and shocking we did bring it up on the three-hour show but we got to

21:31.560 --> 21:37.240
mention it here they're gonna be incorporating a new slash command into

21:37.240 --> 21:42.400
EverQuest 2 yes the MMORPG EverQuest 2 and when I say slash command I mean like

21:42.400 --> 21:46.300
you know sometimes you could hit slash attack to attack something slash say or

21:46.300 --> 21:50.080
slash shout well now they're gonna be putting in a new command called slash

21:50.080 --> 21:55.520
pizza and when you type slash pizza it will bring up a Pizza Hut ordering

21:55.520 --> 22:01.240
window and you can order Pizza Hut Express delivered to you to your door so

22:01.240 --> 22:04.720
you have another excuse never to get up from your chair except to go to the

22:04.720 --> 22:11.160
bathroom as if people playing EverQuest needed more excuses I what slash

22:11.160 --> 22:17.900
commands are gonna come next slash beer slash orgy slash prostitute for blowjob

22:17.900 --> 22:26.660
I mean what it's just I I understand why they're doing it although it's it's got

22:26.660 --> 22:32.540
to be a little bit insulting in a way to here you guys are too lazy to get up and

22:32.540 --> 22:37.740
use the phone we wouldn't want to take you away from your questing they're

22:37.740 --> 22:42.040
facilitating the addictions and you know what I don't think that Final Fantasy 11

22:42.040 --> 22:44.800
would ever get something like that one because they have the little disclaimer

22:44.800 --> 22:48.300
you know don't forget your real life well now I think to be fair I think

22:48.300 --> 22:53.460
EverQuest 2 does have some type of disclaimer and this could just as easily

22:53.460 --> 22:58.100
be built into any I mean it's just EverQuest kind of gets that bad rap to

22:58.100 --> 23:01.500
begin with it but this is something that they could have honestly built in

23:01.500 --> 23:07.360
anything crack yeah exactly ever cracked with pizza could I get my pizza with

23:07.360 --> 23:13.860
crack on it Loki any thoughts it was this something you'd use probably only

23:13.860 --> 23:19.920
because it's Pizza Hut we I would not be using it only because we don't mean

23:19.920 --> 23:25.680
locally so there would be no of no use to me but okay hypothetically there's a

23:25.680 --> 23:33.040
Pizza Hut a mile away hell yeah I love Pizza Hut but I don't like online

23:33.040 --> 23:38.040
ordering because I mean honestly I've worked at a pizza place I know how dumb

23:38.040 --> 23:43.440
they are there's no way that they can do online ordering very well there's I mean

23:43.440 --> 23:48.440
they've got to mess that shit up so and really I mean I have a portable phone

23:48.440 --> 23:52.160
right next to my computer I just picked that sucker up and I can order pizza

23:52.160 --> 23:57.040
while playing a game at the same time. I mean, you can do it over the phone probably a lot

23:57.040 --> 24:02.160
quicker too and it wouldn't interrupt your gameplay as would a, you know, a giant window

24:02.160 --> 24:06.260
over your screen. That and they can repeat back your order to you to make sure they got

24:06.260 --> 24:12.420
it right. Exactly. Alright, to be continued, I'm sure, do you guys think that this will

24:12.420 --> 24:17.380
be a trend? Seeing these more commercial sell out integrations into these games? As somebody

24:17.380 --> 24:20.320
joked during the three hour show, it's just a matter of time before he can buy the pizza

24:20.320 --> 24:25.440
a with Gil or gold or whatever the in-game currency is yeah sadly yes and

24:25.440 --> 24:29.040
I'm sure it's just a matter of time before we start seeing more of these

24:29.040 --> 24:34.160
types of commercial integrations into our favorite online RPGs because we

24:34.160 --> 24:41.040
spend so much time in them addicts and on that note that's going to do it for

24:41.040 --> 24:44.800
