21008	24769	Hello again, everybody, and welcome back to our podcast.

37337	37637	How are you?
39138	40038	I'm not going to do it.

43880	45061	www.orangeloungeradio.com
65245	65845	Thanks for watching!
87990	91591	Tecmo Bowl and High Impact for SNES Ice Hockey and Blades of Steel
112313	136925	because it's pretty it's pretty watching tv it's pretty i don't know i just i feel like a lot of it i think we've talked about this on the three-hour show before but to play a sports game i feel like i should be outside actually playing the sport that's just me though i like sports entertainment games like raw and smackdown yeah because that's stuff i would create a wrestler because i'm a big macho man loki your thoughts on sports games
138095	143501	I don't play sports games unless you consider, you know, BMX XXX a sports game.
143861	144262	Why not?
145463	146344	Just don't do it for me.
146524	150729	I don't like watching sports normally and I don't like playing sports games.
151610	152932	I just dislike sports.
153492	153813	I don't know.
155103	159384	Well, if you guys want to talk about sports games, there's some other podcasts out there where they do talk about it.
159424	162005	Not that there's anything wrong with that, just, you know, not our cup of tea.
162025	164185	We want to talk about other types of video games.
164785	166986	For instance, the games we've been playing this week.
167386	168746	Jimmy, what kind of games have you been playing this week?
169527	170307	Guitar Freaks.
172647	172987	Ah, yes.
173688	174328	We broke it back down.
174368	175028	I played some Papa 9.
176048	178949	Oh, you've had quite a Bomani-filled week, a music gaming week, haven't you?
178969	179669	Just a couple days.
180309	180489	Yeah?
180509	180669	Yeah.
181410	183190	Every time I go home, Dan's either playing...
184764	186005	Well, he's now playing Snake Eater.
187085	188446	I thought he beat Metal Gear Solid 3.
189447	190007	No, not yet.
190027	190567	He didn't bother.
191468	195290	But he's playing that now, but I've been coming home to him playing Guitar Freaks.
195390	195910	It's been funny.
196490	197271	It's been so cute.
197291	200373	But at least it's both Konami games.
201073	203975	And then you go from US Konami to Japanese Konami.
204835	205135	I don't know.
205475	207256	And then I was playing Final Fantasy XI.
208017	208397	Of course.
208477	212099	It's so weird to hear you talk about playing Final Fantasy XI.
212219	213600	That was me and Loki's thing.
215228	216469	I don't play it that much.
217209	218329	Like an hour a day.
220050	220850	Alright, whatever.
220870	221270	After school.
221551	222431	That's how it starts.
222811	223591	That's how it starts.
224212	224952	I have a life.
225432	225992	Me too!
226713	228914	I go to school and the gym and I work.
229834	232915	I work and I drink.
234796	236337	You exercise your liquor.
236937	237917	You know what?
238077	238778	I work out.
238858	242499	I pick up that heavy bottle of liquor and I pick it up and bring it towards my mouth.
242579	243379	It's a little flick.
243900	244240	Forget it.
244280	244880	Who am I trying to kid?
245478	246579	Loki, what have you been playing this week?
248801	251243	Other than Final Fantasy, not really much.
251463	254645	I played some Flash games last night that were weird.
256647	257828	God, I can't remember the website.
257968	265594	It was just, like, they had one, it was Drunken Walk, where you had to, like, make sure your character's balanced, otherwise he falls over and passes out.
266154	272019	There was another one that was called Wheel, and it was, like, it was some weird Flash games.
272039	274661	There's a lot of really interesting stuff out there that people make, and
275521	275922	Thanks for watching!
285075	306173	DDR Angel, who's a common guest we have on the Sunday show, she's heard me constantly bitching about no good games out on DS right now, so she decided to bring over Mr. Driller on the DS so I could check it out, because she's like, hey, there's this new game, and I played it a little bit before, maybe for like five minutes, but I didn't really get to play it a little more in depth until earlier, and...
307961	308622	It's kind of neat.
308962	309943	I like it.
310063	311844	It's the same Mr. Driller game.
311864	314446	There's really not a whole lot that the DS adds to it.
314506	317788	It's just like, oh, it's another freaking Mr. Driller game.
318529	324053	But Mr. Driller is kind of one of those games where I really want to get good at it because I like puzzle games a lot.
324073	330337	Some of my favorite games are puzzle games like Tetris, Super Puzzle Fighter 2 Turbo, and all that.
330898	332399	I want to be good at Mr. Driller, but
333061	334862	The strategy isn't clicking for me.
334962	337244	Like, I can't figure out how to get good at that game.
337584	338905	I just, I keep hammering.
339185	343068	I want to drill down as fast as possible because I think that's the way to do it.
343128	347672	But it's, you have to think about where the bricks are going to fall and my brain isn't developed yet.
347812	348712	It's too tough.
350594	353736	But yeah, Mr. Driller DS, it's just freaking Mr. Driller.
354281	354321	D.S.
354341	354521	PiktoChat
374036	375177	I can't remember which game it is.
375697	396949	There's a game coming out where while you're playing the game I think it's even like a puzzle game or something like that where you're playing the game and there will be a little icon or whatever that will come up if someone's within distance of you that's in PictoChat and you can quit out your game to go to PictoChat or invite them into a multiplayer game.
397989	402952	So it was kind of neat and I wish that they would add that to future games because
403516	404756	or something like that.
404796	406337	That's what they need.
433959	443085	I absolutely agree the DS needed something like this from the start and a lot of Xbox Live games when Xbox Live was first out didn't have this either and they really needed it because
443940	447821	You know, I want to know if certain people around are playing the DS.
447961	449141	Who's in PictoChat?
449481	449962	What room?
449982	454443	It's like, when they first advertised the DS, do you remember that movie they were showing at E3?
454783	460604	And they showed like the kid was reading a book upstairs and the mom was sending a message on PictoChat saying like, come down and eat dinner?
461004	463125	Well, how would the kid ever know that?
463505	466166	If your DS is off, you're not in PictoChat.
466186	470387	The thing doesn't beep to let you know somebody's trying to send you a PictoChat message or anything like that.
470707	471347	It's like the system...
471907	500652	now granted when you see things at E3 it's stuff that's in development so you know maybe that thing hadn't been finalized or whatever but at least it needs something where I think you were saying this to me earlier at least it could show you like who around you if people are playing DS's around you like when you if you look at the webcam for one of our Sunday night shows here we do on Orange Sounds Radio there's usually five people here in studio all playing DS's there should be a way to see what game each person around you is playing honestly DS needs something like that so
502133	502994	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
533157	561396	250 or as they would have you want to know 249 of course that doesn't figure in the tax so you really are going to be paying 250 plus for this and it's going to come with a 32 megabyte memory stick including there will be 24 games that are confirmed for the launch which is probably more games than the DS has out now so that's one thing the PSP is going to have going out the gate so if I were Nintendo I'd be a little worried right now but
562452	564573	PSP has a firm date set.
564894	566075	Now here's the interesting thing.
566655	570918	There may be another, I think, or what was this deal here?
571258	573220	It's, okay, I'm sorry.
573300	582266	Also in the pack, headphones with a remote control, battery pack, AC adapter, case, cleaning cloth, game demo, so you're not getting any
583408	584169	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
602165	604506	As if you didn't know in the movie on DVD already.
604566	606207	I mean, talk about a horde movie.
606347	610789	I mean, you can get Spider-Man 2 in the checkout lane at the grocery store.
610829	612710	That's how, like, everywhere this movie is.
612730	614531	And of course, it's a huge movie.
614831	616732	It's a very audience-friendly movie.
616892	617632	I like the movie.
617652	618753	A lot of people like the movie.
618813	621614	But damn, talk about oversaturation.
621734	622835	I don't know if that's, you know...
624028	632976	That doesn't make me that excited to be one of the first million people who's like, Ooh, I can have Spider-Man 2 again in my pocket to watch again.
633757	636840	I'm just wondering if they fixed the amazing game launcher function.
638801	640243	Mention this one more time for our listeners.
640843	644166	The game launcher function where if you twist it, your game shoots out.
646148	648330	So you can hold up a bank with the game launcher, really.
650152	650472	No, Rob.
653548	654148	Okay, maybe not.
655789	662350	Now, one of the things that I have to laugh about this is the memory stick thing.
664151	667591	With that, I'm sure people are going to have Linux on this in no time.
670612	673273	People will install Linux in a shoebox.
673893	677394	Anything with a monitor, they will try to install Linux on.
677414	678674	Didn't we talk about this last week?
678714	679794	I don't remember which show it was.
679814	682875	We talked about Linux being installed on the iPod, and I'm just like,
683513	685154	They will install Linux on anything.
685414	685855	Anything.
685875	687256	They will install Linux on an iPod.
689358	692340	They're working on Linux on the DS right now, honestly.
693120	693941	I kid you not.
694762	696783	It's so crazy.
700166	701927	Do they have Linux on Commodore 64?
702768	703408	That rocks.
704489	705270	That so rocks.
705350	705630	Alright.
707830	729850	quick gaming note, I want to get to DarkSakura's advice column for the week, I want to give a quick gaming note, this is a series I played for a little bit, I didn't finish this game though, but it was a good game, it kind of felt like watching a movie sometimes though, I didn't have a lot of control over the game, Xenosaga, it's getting a sequel, it came out a while ago, it came out, it felt like it came out quite a while ago, it's just now getting a sequel, February 15th,
731238	738021	Very soon, Xenosaga Part 2, developed by Monolith Soft, same studio that did Episode 1.
739202	745625	And Xenosaga 2 will have more than 100 skills for characters, including Last Revenge, Overload, Double Power.
745985	752688	New to the battle system are Double Attacks, and that will be like a team-up mode, where you do a team-up and you do one big assault.
752768	753949	So, Xenosaga 2.
755269	757050	Did you ever play the Xenosaga games at all, Jamie?
757913	758073	No.
758193	759534	You didn't just really get into the series?
759914	760054	No.
760154	768578	I thought you were the one that... That was... One of my old buddies made me play it, actually play it, but I thought you were the one that first told me about it.
768598	771159	That was Miklatov, who was into Xenogears.
771700	771960	Maybe.
772580	773060	I don't know.
773260	780984	I didn't remember, however, the hint to the existence of Xenogears in Final Fantasy VII, when Cloud's in the hospital.
781879	783440	And he's mumbling incoherently.
784000	786781	And he says, Zenogias.
788001	789802	Z-E-N-O dot dot dot.
789862	790742	G-I-A-S.
793863	796084	All sorts of little inside jokes in those Squeenix games.
796865	797245	Alright.
798485	801446	We here at Orange House Radio, not only do we want to make your lives... I'm sorry.
801486	806308	Not only do we want to talk about what's going on in the video game world, but we want to make your lives better.
806688	809169	Therefore, the usually angsty DarkSakura...
809827	815855	has her little advice column for you guys and we call it DarkSakura's Advice Column.
817618	819300	Jamie, what did you bring for us this week?
819821	822104	Today's bit of advice is how to win a bar fight.
823860	832745	Most state laws stipulate that you may use sufficient force to stop an attack, but you may not deliver any sort of punitive retribution to your attacker.
833706	836207	Remembering this may save you a costly trip to the court.
836247	839849	Basically, in English, you can stop someone from attacking you, but you can't punch them back.
841210	841350	Aww.
842111	843712	Where's the fun in that bar fight?
844132	845093	Eh, this is just how to win.
845113	846553	What about breaking a bottle on their head?
846593	847134	Does that count?
847914	850216	If it's enough to stop them from hitting you again, sure.
851778	854559	Anyway, here's four easy steps to win a bar fight.
855539	858800	Number one, attack the most sensitive areas of your opponent.
859300	860681	Eyes, groin, knee, and throat.
861241	861941	Stay close.
862121	864562	If your opponent is large, he will need room to hit you.
865422	868183	Two, attack repeatedly and be efficient.
868543	872244	Make fast, repeated blows to any or all sensitive areas.
872284	874925	I want a nice, clean, efficient bar fight.
876285	878526	That means kicking the balls repeatedly.
880452	885356	Number three, if necessary, use a weapon.
885976	891360	Choices include telephones, pens, bottles, books, beer mugs, coffee cups, and keys.
892581	899025	Four, protect yourself from additional attackers by fighting with your back too, but not up against a corner or a wall.
900506	901467	Very interesting.
902248	904569	I also have a little bit more to add to that.
904689	904970	Okay.
904990	906831	It's a move that they taught us in my karate class.
907416	914302	If you happen to be picked up and have the ever-loving chick squeezed out of you, all you have to do is get your hands free and hit them on the side of the head with your palms.
915663	917985	I would demonstrate, but our listeners will not see that.
918025	921948	Kind of like how when you do something stupid, your mom smacks you upside the head and goes, What were you thinking?
922428	926131	Oh, no, it's more of like with both hands at once.
926231	928373	Both hands on the side, because it will disorient them.
930234	930975	Very interesting thought.
932005	933006	DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
959591	962192	Okay, maybe not, but it doesn't stop it from happening.
963233	964914	Guess what game's coming next?
966074	968456	Of course, you knew this was going to happen.
968816	981823	Variety is reporting that Microsoft has quietly put the finishing touches on a million dollar deal with the guy that wrote the movie 28 Days Later to adapt Halo, the movie.
982343	984384	Oh, first of all.
985284	986685	Now, I like 28 Days Later.
986745	987746	That was a good movie.
987806	988106	I don't know.
988877	989897	It was a good zombie movie.
990918	995359	Weird ending, but you know, it was a good movie.
996080	997600	Halo movie.
998900	1000981	We better not see what the Master Chief looks like.
1002162	1003362	28 Days Later, a good zombie movie.
1003522	1005423	Evil Dead, a good zombie movie.
1005923	1007984	28 Days Later, what the hell was that?
1010604	1012285	That was more like what it is.
1012525	1017807	It's like, you know, we want to kind of do a Dawn of the Dead, but
1018399	1048003	not quite Dawn of the Dead let's make them run because that's a little different you know they don't normally run and then um we'll just go ahead and um I don't know make a really shitty ending here's the weird thing about Halo is that in many aspects it already is a movie so I don't kind of understand the but of course a lot of the Resident Evil games had a very movie feel to them and they made a game they made a movie out of that anyway but I mean yeah they made they made two movies out of Resident Evil but
1048851	1056133	The only movie that should ever be made, and I'm sure Jamie's going to agree with me on this, is Red vs. Blue the movie.
1056553	1057834	Yes, we need Red vs. Blue the movie.
1057874	1066696	That is the only way that this movie will be any good, because Red vs. Blue, they could honestly put that on TV, and that would be entertaining.
1067597	1074599	I was going to say Castlevania the movie, which we've been bitching about for years, and no, Van Helsing was not Castlevania the movie.
1074799	1075319	I'm sorry.
1075699	1078420	It needs to be like Dracula X version.
1079460	1081101	I think that's good because at least then it will stay Halo
1108211	1137062	and not like Hollywood Halo well it's easy not to fuck up their movie don't get it to that one guy that made those three movies I mean he's the one that's crapping out these really shitty scripts actually I believe Resident Evil and Mortal Kombat were done by one guy and then Alone in the Dark and House of the Dead were done by another guy House of the Dead and Alone in the Dark guy that's the guy that should not touch any scripts for anything ever never ever ever touch anything okay
1137606	1142409	It scares me enough that the guy that directed Catwoman is going to be doing Akira.
1142589	1143910	That scares the shit out of me.
1143930	1144010	What?
1144530	1146771	Yes, he will be doing the live action Akira.
1147091	1147392	What?
1147812	1151194	Yes, so look forward to that piece of shit coming out.
1154435	1156397	Somewhere inside, I am crying.
1156677	1160679	And watch him fully base it off of the anime, which would absolutely suck.
1161249	1163109	They need to base it off of the manga for it to be any good.
1163129	1163970	Why did you hear that?
1164270	1169351	I realize you kind of work in the industry a little bit, so you pick up on things like that, but where did you hear something like that?
1170071	1171652	It was on Ain't It Cool News like a while ago.
1172132	1175973	They have, um, because they had a whole big thing about it and how they're like, oh god, why?
1176553	1177913	You know, but, I don't know.
1179333	1184435	Don't get me wrong, I love Ain'tItCoolNews.com, but I hope that's another one of their fake-ass rumors.
1184635	1185195	I really do.
1185795	1186655	There were some other ones.
1186715	1189316	There was, um, oh god, I want to say...
1190464	1190864	Who was it?
1190904	1195587	James Cameron's going to be picking up Battle Angel, which is going to be good.
1195887	1196567	That would be good.
1196848	1197928	James Cameron doing that.
1198088	1202911	So I can see that being pretty sweet.
1202931	1208254	Then, of course, you have the live-action Aeon Flux movie coming out, which should be pretty good, I imagine.
1209735	1212436	I have issues with Charlize Theron, though, but I'll save that for another show.
1213997	1215318	Anyway, moving on.
1216231	1218053	Speaking of movies, now let's go the other way.
1218113	1220354	Let's talk about movies going into games.
1220675	1222096	This was a big story this week.
1222536	1228680	EA is developing a game based on an old movie, The Godfather.
1229060	1239448	They're doing a Godfather game, and this made news this week because I believe Marlon Brando was quoted in an interview a long time ago, or somehow an article came up about him this week.
1240048	1243631	No, he wasn't quoted, but somebody had said about him that he initially refused
1244111	1247812	The part he played in the movie The Godfather, you know, you can't refuse that whole thing.
1248312	1252393	He refused that because he felt that the movie glorified the Mafia.
1253613	1257854	And it turns out he actually has loaned his voice talents to this game.
1258394	1259334	Yes, he's dead.
1259654	1260875	He did it before he died.
1260935	1263075	This game's been in production for quite some time.
1263335	1267056	Marlon Brando actually loaned his voice to the game.
1267396	1268876	And what is this game going to be doing?
1269517	1271257	Glorifying the Mafia, you betcha.
1272483	1277064	And I hear that he's going to be releasing a new album with Tupac coming out later on.
1277204	1278225	And Elvis.
1278585	1281786	And Elvis, yeah, because they make new music even after they're dead.
1283546	1284507	Anyways, you were saying?
1286327	1294810	Well, Robert Duvall and James Caan will also be loading their voices to this, so that should be interesting.
1295230	1298551	And EA is going to have a big gala premiere of The Godfather February 10th.
1300271	1301412	and guess what?
1301512	1304993	It's going to be first shown to the public in the New York City neighborhood of Little Italy.
1305473	1305974	Isn't that cute?
1307334	1307795	Alright.
1308595	1310236	One more news story for you guys tonight.
1310336	1311356	I'm excited about this.
1311556	1312036	I really am.
1312337	1313317	I saved the best for last.
1314217	1318499	Capcom is going to be doing a couple new compilations.
1319100	1322781	And you know how they did the Mega Man Anniversary Collection last year, which was such a good idea.
1323282	1324222	Oh, it was such a good idea.
1324542	1325763	I was very pleased with that game.
1326603	1328104	Did you play the Mega Man compilation at all?
1328941	1330702	I did, but the timing was way off.
1332743	1334064	Did you play it on GameCube or PS2?
1334884	1337225	I think that we had Dan try it out on PS2.
1338205	1343188	Because on the NES, he can do Quickman's level without using the time stopper.
1344388	1345969	And he couldn't do it on the PS2.
1346349	1348070	But he came home and did it again on the NES.
1348690	1349070	Interesting.
1350311	1352132	We'll see.
1353264	1361247	Um, but Mega Man, they're also going to be doing a Mega Man X collection, because the Mega Man Anniversary Collection did so well, they're going to do a compilation of all the Mega Man X games.
1361647	1363467	This really shouldn't be a surprise to anyone.
1363507	1366248	I think this is kind of a foregone conclusion, but that's pretty cool.
1366728	1374911	They actually released this little trailer that just, they haven't said exactly what games are going to be in it, but they did catch one unlockable that's going to be in the game.
1375291	1379072	Mega Man Battle and Chase will be an unlockable that's in the Mega Man X collection.
1379329	1380749	It's pretty obscure, that's cool.
1380930	1386912	Yeah, but I mean, if you think about it, the two arcade games that they put in the Mega Man collection to begin with were also pretty obscure.
1387572	1388852	Where's Mega Man Soccer?
1390093	1391273	I want that in a collection.
1392994	1393214	What?
1393914	1394614	You know what they need?
1395174	1397455	Is fucking Mega Man Legends 3, okay?
1397695	1398596	I love those games.
1398896	1401436	Even a Mega Man Legends Online would be awesome.
1401757	1405858	Because that could totally, you know, become an RPG, even though it's like all weird and everything.
1408339	1419003	Capcom, by the way, is also going to be developing a Capcom Classics Collection, and it's going to be basically this compilation of classic games from Capcom.
1419363	1433948	They haven't said what games are going to be in it, but they're hinting that it will include old school favorites, such as those that have been seen in the Capcom's Generations compilations that were released in Japan for the Saturn and PlayStation.
1434068	1435128	I actually have one of those.
1435148	1437649	I have the Makai Mura set, which is...
1438459	1464348	ghouls and ghosts, ghosts and goblins see now I think those are the kinds of things and might I say Capcom pretty pretty pretty please I have a couple requests Bionic Commando, Strider Magic Sword Strider and Quiz and Dragons how cool would that be okay I'm kidding on the last one
1464651	1471613	Now, I want them to do, though, an arcade compl... The thing about Strider is that they released it as part of the Strider 2 set.
1473374	1477275	Which is funny, because they even made the changes... Because we have the Japanese version and the U.S.
1477295	1479196	version, because my fiancé is a big Strider fiend.
1481297	1486919	For any of our listeners who ever frequented any of the Strider sites, he actually had Neo Strider's Strider Zone back in the day.
1488179	1489540	Which is one of the first ones out there.
1489760	1489900	Wow.
1491849	1495430	But the first one where he's swinging, he sort of goes, ha, ha, ha, ha, the whole time.
1495851	1496771	He doesn't do that in the U.S.
1496871	1499072	one, and they fully did the U.S.
1499632	1500332	when they brought that out.
1500873	1505655	But we need Captain Commando.
1507035	1507255	Yes.
1507575	1508636	We need Captain Commando.
1508896	1509276	Yes, we do.
1509576	1510777	And we need the D&D games.
1512417	1514078	And I want Super Slam Masters again.
1514358	1515058	Super Slam Masters.
1515419	1517680	Well, Captain Commando did come out on the PlayStation.
1518040	1518620	It was three-player.
1519810	1521231	I don't remember that coming out on the PlayStation.
1521251	1521471	It did.
1521792	1522132	I have it.
1522732	1523493	It's awesome.
1524794	1525614	Alright, we'll see.
1526015	1527236	Oh, I have high hopes for this.
1527336	1529337	I hope it's as good as those Midway collections.
1529377	1531339	Seriously, those are some of the best collections I've played.
1531739	1539625	And I hope it's not like the Nintendo collections where they put 20... I'm sorry, they put one game, released it for 20 bucks on a Game Boy Advance cart.
1539925	1543268	Especially when it's games that were unlockable in other games, i.e.
1543348	1543968	Metroid.
1544509	1544889	Shame.
1544929	1547471	I mean, a couple of them were cool, like Zelda was cool.
1548402	1550763	But seriously, $20 for Donkey Kong?
1551004	1551864	I don't think so.
1552464	1554266	That's not the way to do these compilations.
1554646	1556567	Midway knows how to do the compilations.
1556867	1558408	I hope Capcom takes the page out of their book.
1559369	1561910	You could just play Animal Crossing and get all those games.
1562450	1565312	Animal Crossing is like a $240 value.
1567313	1568394	It's one way to think about it.
1568554	1570915	Alright, that's going to do it for this podcast.
1571236	1572957	Jamie, any parting words for our listeners?
1573357	1573957	Parting words?
1575018	1575378	Loki.
1576839	1576979	Nope.
1578168	1580249	Well then I guess I will be apathetic too.
1580390	1581050	Have a good one.
1581090	1582431	Thanks for subscribing to us.
1582831	1583832	See you next week guys.
