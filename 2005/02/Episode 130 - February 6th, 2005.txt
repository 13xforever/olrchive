Orange Lounge Radio
Oh, God.
Call me Daddy.
Orange Lounge may contain adult content.
Orange Lounge may contain many four-letter words.
Orange Lounge may contain a scene of nudity.
Orange Lounge may contain plenty of... Just kidding.
Orange Lounge Radio will not contain any of that in this episode.
Well, isn't that special?
Orange Lounge Radio Live is a fully interactive program via our website at www.orangeloungeradio.com And now, here are your hosts for Orange Lounge Radio Live, DarkSakura, Sky, and Loki.
We are live!
And this is episode number 130 for this episode.
February the 6th, 2005.
You're tuned in to the B-Money scene's most apathetic, when it comes to football anyway, radio station of all things B-Money.
My name is Rob Roberts, you might know me as Sky.
Joining me, as always, are my awesome co-hosts in this corner, the happiest bunny on the farm, Miss Jamie Summers, a.k.a.
DarkSakura.
You know that's coming out on DVD this Tuesday.
If anybody is out there maybe thinking that, God damn, Jamie's beating that joke in the ground.
She's just, you know, trying to help those folks out, sell some DVDs.
Because hearing that sound 20 times a show, doesn't that make you want to buy the movie?
Also joining us, say hello to TechMassaLoki.
You're knee-deep in silence right now.
And I'm knee-deep in not turning the mic on.
There you go.
What did you say before that?
You're knee-deep in... I'm such a dumb-up-ass.
Dumb-up-ass.
Hilarious, those of you that were listening last week.
He's knee-deep in hot poo.
I finished the monitor, though.
For what?
Nobody knows what you're talking about.
I finished the monitor.
The monitor for the PC I'm building.
Okay.
Because I mounted a monitor inside of a case.
We have to show this on the webcam.
I will.
Because it's very dorky.
And our listeners love that dorky stuff.
I gotta find the goddamn strap though for this because it doesn't have a handle.
It's around here somewhere.
In my mess.
Alright, also joining us tonight, say hello to our special guest.
Say hello to DDR Angel!
Hi!
I have chicken and stuff and... Yeah, my stomach's gonna be full in about five minutes.
Leave me alone.
My stomach is still full from yesterday.
Oh my god.
I'm going to talk about that in a little bit.
You had stuff, and it was good.
I had stuff upon stuff, covered in stuff, and then flavored with extra stuff.
It was beautiful.
It was much stuff.
Extreme.
No, wait, that was bad.
Max stuff.
Oh, hi.
Say hello also to special guest Bug.
Hi.
How you doing?
I'm doing good.
I like saying your name.
Bug!
It's Dad's birthday, so it wasn't my dad.
What?
We're having a hard time hearing you, so... It's Dad's birthday.
Oh.
Oh.
No, my dad.
Your dad.
No, no, no.
My dad.
It was Rib's day then.
Well, that's good.
I, too, am full of meaty goodness.
Alright, we'll have to talk about fun days.
We'll have to talk about Bomani news, all that stuff going on right now.
in the Mimani world.
But first, we're going to do a break.
And tonight, you guys...
2DX Red, the soundtrack, it came out this week.
And I'll tell you what, you take another listen to some of these songs when it's on the actual soundtrack and the levels of some instruments are up a little and down, it's all cleaner and it's nice and crisp and clear.
When you listen to this on the soundtrack, a lot of these songs are just awesome.
So we're going to be playing some stuff from the official soundtrack tonight.
We're going to start it off with a song called Injection of Love.
I love this song.
This is the one that has the F-word in it.
So listen for it.
We played this either last week or the week before.
But listen to the soundtrack version and some more 2DX Red music tonight.
And we'll be back.
Injection of Love also makes it sound like... I know, Injection of Love makes it sound like fucking to begin with, doesn't it?
It makes it sound like it's full of meaty goodness as well.
You lie down on that bed!
I'm gonna inject you with love!
Dumbass.
Are you ready to get injected with love?
Ejected or injected?
That about says it.
Yep, it's definitely time for Orange Lounge Radio.
We'll be back after this.
Thank you for watching!
Thanks for watching!
Thanks for watching!

Hi-ho, Kermit the Frog here, informing you that today's broadcast of Orange Lounge Radio is brought to you by the letter V, the letter A, and the number 59.
Can you tell me how to get, how to get to Sesame Street?
Orange Lounge Radio
and it's, forgive me if I pronounce this wrong, it's just Agiha or something like that?
A-G-E-H-A.
Agiha.
Agiha.
I think so.
Before that, the song Sphere from 2DX11, pretty cool song.
EVO66, which by the way, is by the same group that did North from 2DX4 style.
You guys remember that song?
It was like very, I don't know, like Renaissance Fair Rave type song.
I really don't know how to explain that song.
Wait, let me play a little bit of North.
Here's a little clip of North from 2DX4 style.
It's kind of like happy.
Like flute or something.
And then they go from that to this.
I guess this is a little more Ravish.
I don't know.
I don't know.
How do you get from point A to point B?
I have no idea.
All right.
And then starting that set off, Injection of Love, the song where she says, Fook me.
What the fook is going on over there, you guys?
We're just fooking around.
Okay.
What are you fooking doing?
What the fook is that?
Just showing a picture.
Oh, okay.
That's a pretty fucking good picture.
Alright, anyway.
Let the joke die.
Alright.
We're going to start off tonight's show as we do every week, playing a little bit of How was your week?
How was your day?
Your chance to catch up with us and what we've been doing.
It's better than LiveJournal, really.
Jamie, how was your week?
How was your day?
My week was pretty okay.
It was... Work was great.
I love my job now.
You know...
I made a comment to my boss that I had no job stress.
He was like, what was this business?
I was like, no, there's a difference between having a lot of work to do and having emotional stress.
And I don't have any of that at my job now.
So it's been really great.
I can go to work happy.
I can leave happy.
I can be happy all day at work.
How many people can say that?
When I got my last promotion, I felt the exact same way.
I went from feeling useless to feeling good about what I did.
I literally felt useless in my old position.
In my old position I had the evil VP, who I hope dies.
I liked everybody I worked with.
I don't think I've really worked with any bad people unless they were people who weren't there very long.
I enjoyed my entire team.
Yeah, I've had the fortunacy of working with good people, but that doesn't always mean that I was doing the best kind of work, you know what I mean?
My work is really easy.
It's all spreadsheets and computer stuff that I don't have to really... I can listen to my music.
As long as I can listen to my music and do my work, I'm a happy bunny.
And what do you do?
You listen to Phantom of the Opera while you work?
Dude, I was.
and one of my co-workers came up and goes, oh my god, this is awesome.
So which track are you on?
She tried to figure out what track I was listening to by the playlist.
I want to know, is it timed so that when you walk in the door... When I'm driving, yes.
That's how I wake up in the morning is by putting in my Phantom of the Opera soundtrack.
That should be somebody's alarm in the morning.
Like, can you imagine, you know, you're resting all peacefully and then the sun's coming up and then your CD player kicks in and it's at max volume.
Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo.
That would be awesome.
I should do that to Dan one day.
You just have to be where falling chandeliers.
Yeah, it's so loud the chandelier falls.
Ha, ha, ha.
Anyway.
In our case, it'd be the halogen lamp falls over.
It turns out it was the cat after all.
She's, you know, the cat
Your cat's playing?
The cat's the bandit.
How do you tune your cats?
Kick her.
I don't know.
That's where I wake up to cat in the face.
Meow!
Mom, feed me!
Meow!
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Are you pissed off that they never released any new ones on PlayStation?
Dan is, but we're looking for the second Append now.
Oh, okay.
But I finally, finally passed Liar Liar all the way through.
Yay.
I'm not really all that great at Guitar Freaks.
But I can pass Carnival Day like it's, you know, nothing.
That was one of the bonus tracks from 5th.
Why will they not put Guitar Freaks 5?
It's Guitar Freaks 5 isn't out for home, right?
Yeah, it is.
I thought Guitar Freak's fourth... It's the one labeled Guitarra.
Guitar Freak's fifth, Germania fourth.
I thought that they stopped with fourth third.
I think it's fourth third is where they stop.
I'm sure somebody in the chat... Okay, no, you're right.
It's three seconds and then fourth third.
Fourth third.
And then five, four is the one they really need to do.
Like, all of my favorite Guitar Freak songs were on fifth.
Yeah.
And then six.
And there's, you know, there's good ones as the series goes on.
It depends on you, though, on the fourth third.
Well...
and Liar Liar and Dynamite.
I'm not saying there's bad songs, but I'm just saying all the songs I want to play, what would make me get a guitar, little controller and all that stuff, because I would never get a drum set at home type thing.
It's just, I just, I really suck at Drum Mania and it's not a game I want to get better at.
Good for you, but not for me.
I got it pretty cheap, too.
But Guitar Freaks is kind of fun.
What I love about Guitar Freaks is the cheesy side of me.
I love how you get bonus points for when you do the little... With the whale.
Like, you know, lift the guitar up like you're a rock star.
Okay, I'm lame, whatever.
I shoot myself in the head like a rock star.
But, um... No, uh... What else?
Um...
mainly, you know, and I did school, doing a project for my art class.
It's supposed to be my midterm, so we're starting it now, because we're not going to have a test, we're just going to do a project.
And I have to take, I told you about this earlier, but you take a picture from a magazine, you have to redo it as a pencil contour drawing, and then redo it as a ink contour, then do an ink wash version of the picture, Conti crayon, oil pastel, watercolor, um...
There's another one that I'm forgetting.
Charcoal, which I hate charcoal.
So you have to do the same painting over and over.
Yeah.
And so far, I'm almost done with my charcoal one.
My ContiCran one's almost done.
That leaves me the ink wash, oil pastel, watercolor, and then the random one.
You basically reinvent the picture.
I am a horrible, horrible artist.
I will never take an art class.
It's the one thing I was not meant to do ever in my life was take an art class.
I'm helping with the other thing that I brought today.
The other thing that my house has been taking up with has been Dracula X on the Turbo Duo.
And I have, for later on today, brought that.
Okay, we'll talk about that later.
I've been doing lots of retro gaming in the house.
We've been playing Tengen Tetris.
Why?
It sucked.
It sucked.
No, it was awesome.
I did not get the big deal with Tank and Tetris.
Tank and Tetris has cooperative play.
Okay, I'll give you that.
It does have the better multiplayer.
But the music was better, and the Nintendo and the graphics were better, and it was cutesier.
It was Nintendo-fied!
Tank and Tetris had cooperative play, which makes it all worth it.
But Tank and Tetris, outside of that, was really ghetto.
It was still Tink and Tetris.
It looked like Commodore 64 Tetris.
No, worse.
It looked like Atari 800 Tetris.
Well, it was made by Atari.
Yeah, and it looked like they took a direct port from the Atari 800.
I mean, it's still cool because it's like, ooh, the game that was banned in a court of law type thing.
They can't make this game anymore.
For that reason, it's cool, but still...
It's not the best Tetris game, in my opinion.
The one on Game Boy was really the greatest Tetris game.
It's still one of the shining stars of my collection.
Understandable.
What about your cartridge of Custer's Revenge?
We don't have a cartridge of Custer's Revenge.
You need one.
We've got a ROM of it.
Actually, I take that back.
We have a ROM chip of it.
Okay, the ROM chip is cool, but as far as the ROM on the computer goes, almost everybody that's ever emulated Atari 2600 on their PC, the first thing they go and download is Custer's Revenge.
And X-Man.
Custer's Revenge, X-Man, and Adventure.
Or E.T.
E.T.
is horrible.
I actually own E.T.
Because people usually remember Adventure and E.T.
for two very different reasons.
E.T.
is the worst game ever.
And Adventure, probably, for most people, the best game ever that they played.
or Yars' Revenge.
Pac-Man.
Pac-Man was the second worst game ever.
Isn't that interesting that Yars' Revenge and E.T.
had a lot of the same staff?
And one's the worst game ever and one's the best game ever?
I went to the panel that they did at Classic Gaming Expo.
Oh, I should have gone to that.
Was that this year or was that last year?
That was this past year.
Did Battlezone and quite a number of other games.
Defender.
That was pretty cool.
But yesterday I hung out with Iguana Girl.
We went shopping.
Had dinner.
I burned a bunch, I mean, made pictures of a bunch of DVDs.
I thought she was going to say she burned a bunch of forest or something.
I burned a bunch of people.
And played more of the Final Fantasy game.
Well, you at the mall, I can imagine you wanting to burn down some people.
Did you walk by any girls that were shopping together?
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God, you're going to look so cute in that.
The mall was busy, like Christmas busy.
It was insane.
It was everyone teaming up for Super Bowl.
Damn.
More of the S word.
Here's what it is.
The stupid bowl.
Here's what it is.
Since the stupid bowl was going on today, and all the women knew they'd have to be in the kitchen today,
They went to the mall yesterday.
Okay, you know what?
This is, you know, the zeros.
I'm just kidding.
People better get some, you know, liberation going on.
Maybe men make their own damn nachos and get their own damn beer.
I'm just kidding with you.
I like getting y'all riled up.
I like burning a fire on ya.
Rob.
Rob.
Rob.
Rob.
Rob.
Rob.
Are you done?
Rob!
Are you done?
Rob!
Are you done?
What?
Hi.
Hi.
You weren't high.
You are high.
Anything else?
I'm high on life.
Anything else?
No.
Let's keep the show going, people!
Oh, other than stupid cookie woman, but I'm bringing that up during the FU's.
Stupid Cookie Woman.
Reading about the Stupid Cookie Woman.
Alright, I'll have to hear about this later.
No, it's about the two girls who baked all the cookies for her neighborhood and then the one woman sued them.
Huh.
I will be discussing that later.
Can we talk about the Stupid Bowl for a minute?
Sure.
I hate it, but go ahead.
Well, I'm surprised we have this many people listening tonight with that whole thing going on.
But what is your grudge against the Stupid Bowl, Jamie?
It's
Like a bastardized version of rugby.
At least rugby has men getting bloody wearing shorts.
Big advantages there.
Real football is soccer.
And on top of that, it's just another excuse for millions and millions of Americans to sit on their lazy asses, drink beer, and scream obscenities at their TV.
How's that different from any other Sunday night?
Yeah, I was going to say, instead we encourage you to, we are encouraging our listeners to sit home, drink juice, and sit and listen to obscenities be screamed at them.
You know, if I were the one screaming the obscenities at them, that would be worthwhile.
What's stopping you?
I need a really big megaphone.
I'm sure his wife would have been happy.
Can you imagine Paul McCartney having a wardrobe malfunction where a ball falls out or something?
That's disgusting.
I seriously doubt it.
I would petition the FCC myself.
I bet you Saturday Night Live is going to get him next time and he's going to have a wardrobe malfunction like Janet where his shirt rips off or something.
That's disgusting.
Loki's shirt ripped off?
What?
Uh-oh.
You broke something, you fixed it.
My previous...
Well, are you done?
You done?
I guess so.
Well, are you done?
I guess so.
Fine.
I guess I'll go then.
You're done since you said you're done.
I just said I guess so.
I didn't say I was done.
See, this is my pet peeve about women.
They don't fucking come out and say yes or no.
They always have to go maybe.
Fine.
I'm done.
Speak!
Anyways.
I just fixed the monitor because it wasn't working.
And my previous assumption of there's two sets of cords going to the screen, and I thought one of them was for the standard composite inputs.
You have to set up your story because you can't assume that every... English for the technological illiterate.
I was getting there.
Alright, alright.
Shit.
Anyways.
It worked exactly like I thought, so when I unplugged something, it worked perfectly.
So, now the monitor works, and I'm happy.
But because I tried cutting something off of the Dremel tool, I accidentally grounded something up.
So anyways, the monitor thing, this is for that computer that I'm building that's inside of an Xbox.
The monitor itself is an old PlayStation 1 monitor, LCD thing, that's like 5 inch.
And right now we have the Turbo Duo on there, so...
Are we going to be able to play Final Fantasy XI on it?
You know, to be honest, I could do that, but not on that computer.
You're not going to be able to play Final Fantasy XI on that computer.
Nope!
That computer is way too weak.
You can play Final Fantasy on the emulator.
Final Fantasy III.
Or VI.
Hooray.
You can play Phantasy Star Online.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
The rest of the week was me being sick and just playing a lot of Final Fantasy.
We went to the buffet yesterday and that was fun because I hadn't been there.
And what else?
Oh, that's pretty much it.
Just people quitting at my work now and that's funny because they're going to be screwed and I don't care.
Yeah, it's just that kind of thing.
That's all that happened to me.
Alrighty, let's hear from DDR Angel.
How was your week?
How was your day?
Not much.
Just a lot of school and homework and, you know, the usual stuff.
Working and... Running into creepy guys at fries on Tuesday nights?
Yes, running into you.
No, actually it was kind of funny.
I, um...
went over to Fry's on Tuesday and aside from watching 23rd Magus play DDR again because he always has to stop there for some reason just to show off or whatever.
Okay, not really show off.
Just play.
So I was looking for a new speaker set and just some other stuff that I needed and I ran into Bugged!
And that was fun.
Yes, and I recovered perfectly fine, thank you.
What did I do?
I did nothing!
You said you ran into me.
Yes, I did.
No, no, no, no, no.
That would be 23rd Magus running into you.
Puppy porn?
What?
I don't want to know.
Okay.
It's the puppy bowl.
Puppies don't have bowls?
Not much other than that.
I really wish that I could play Final Fantasy XI this week, but homework kind of got in the way and all that stuff.
So this week, hopefully, I will get things done probably tonight or tomorrow, and then I can play with everyone.
Yay!
Yay!
And that'd be it.
Be gentle when you play with all of us.
How was your week?
How was your day?
I ran into this creepy person at Fry's on Tuesday night.
I'm not creepy, I'm angelic.
I wasn't talking about you.
I was the other creepy one.
Yeah, he's creepy.
He was.
He gave me this weird eye like, damn, I know you.
I gave him the weird eye like, I do know you.
Well, I would call it something, but then... Yeah, never mind.
I'll just call it the eyebrow.
Anyway, other than that, how was your week and your day?
Uh, ended up in San Jose yesterday for a birthday party.
Lots of video games and other various games.
Yes, how'd that go?
That went pretty well.
And, uh, got back at like 2am, beat my brother home.
It was working.
Uh-huh.
Heh heh.
He was kind of surprised to see his big brother sitting at the computer in the kitchen when he walked in at 3am.
Can't blame him.
I'd be surprised too if somebody was sitting at the computer in my kitchen at 3am.
And, uh, let's see.
Picked up two video games today.
The toy liquidator store over at the outlets had buy one get one 50% off, so I got Civ 3 and Douglas Adams Titanic.
Two games I've really wanted to play for a long time.
Now that I can actually afford them,
I'm curious about Civ 3, like, I haven't really played it.
Oh, well, if you want to give it a test drive.
Yeah, I might have to try that out.
I heard that Civ 3 was a little more like Civ 1 than Civ 2 was, because Civ 2 was too much for me.
Like, I, oh my god, like, it's too complicated.
Civ 1's bad enough, but Civ 2 is like, oh my god.
But somebody told me that Civ 3 is a little easier, but I hope that's true.
Nothing beats Populous, though.
Populous was cool because you could drown people by just taking away all the land.
If you guys have never played Populous, check it out sometime.
Seriously.
I owned it on Super Nintendo, okay?
Yeah, it was out on the computer as well.
It was really a computer game, too.
It was one of those games that some genius decided they were going to port from PC to Super Nintendo.
Although the game really, really was not designed to be played on the console.
But you try it anyway.
And that's how it was on Super Nintendo.
The game was awesome.
Drowning your own people are the best.
My week's been pretty damn boring.
And Tuesday's going to be a very interesting day with the funeral.
A lot of people from the past life have come out of the woodwork.
That's tomorrow?
Tuesday.
Tuesday.
I... Well, yeah.
You work.
I'll talk to... Well, yeah, that.
There's that.
And, you know, I just... I don't like funerals.
I really, really don't, so... Yeah.
Yeah.
But other than that, well, it's pretty standard.
All right.
Fair enough.
My week and my day.
I guess it's my turn.
Okay, I want to expand on the buffet thing.
We went to Thunder Valley Casino, which is this little Indian casino.
Well, it's not really little.
It's this big Indian casino that is somewhere between here, where we are in Sacramento, and Reno, which is where all the gambling used to happen.
But now that they have this new Indian casino, that's where everybody in this area goes to gamble, and Reno is practically going bankrupt because of it.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Like, I brought back one plate that had like this really good tortellini on it and coconut shrimp.
And I think my buddy Christopher put it best.
The coconut shrimp tasted like a Krispy Kreme donut.
It was so good.
And I love coconut shrimp.
I had so much coconut yesterday.
I had that and I had a coconut cream pie.
Sorry, am I making you guys hungry?
I'm sorry.
I ate so much.
I was so full.
And then I lost $75 in the casino.
Go me.
I rock.
So...
Loki, how long would you say it took me to lose $75?
About 10 minutes.
Because I play quarters and dollars.
I don't stick around for that nickel stuff.
That ain't gambling.
That's how you don't lose $75.
Because a buck gets you 20 plays.
Oh, well, see, no, no, no.
Because on nickel machines, this actually, you know what, we can relate this to Bomani because a lot of those nickel machines are built by Konami.
You may not know this, but Konami actually has a lot of these machines as well.
And the deal is that a lot of the nickel machines that are out there are actually video slot machines.
And the way they're built, they have five reels.
And when you put that, you can play them nine different ways.
It's like you could play it straight across, you could play it diagonally, bouncing around this way and that way, and making little mountains and valleys.
It's crazy, all the different line patterns that you can have when you play on a nickel slot machine.
So, if you want to play all nine ways on a nickel slot, you're really spending 50 cents a pull.
Yes, but you have nine chances to win.
But that's crap, because that stuff is programmed to only spit out so much money.
I hate playing nickel slots, to be honest.
There's actually more than five arrows, so it's better than pump butt.
Pretty mellow.
I didn't do a lot.
I was sick Wednesday.
I didn't go to work.
And so, you know, that's kind of a bummer.
But don't drink on weeknights, kids.
This is something I learned.
Don't drink on a weeknight.
Don't over-drink on a weeknight.
Yeah, don't over-drink on a weeknight.
Don't do it without a plan.
Don't take seven shots of straight-up rum on a weeknight within the scope of an hour.
You know?
Yes?
That would stop me.
Don't do that at any time.
Seriously?
If I ever do that again, I'm checking myself into AA or something, and I'm not into those 12-step programs.
I'm a one-step program kind of person.
I'm no more drinking on weeknights, period.
Step one, remove cap.
Step two, take shot glass.
That's your 12-step program.
Poor liquor.
Step four, drink.
Step five, fuck the other steps.
I have a two-step program over the tracks.
Brewery.
You live right near him.
Yes.
For those that don't know, you live near a brewery.
I don't even know that I live near a brewery.
I don't know how long I tell anyone else.
I've got to come out there sometime.
It's just weeknight, drive.
You can drive with someone.
I know, I will.
Someday.
Take the train.
Someday.
I guess that's it for now.
If I think of something else exciting, I'll tell you guys about it later.
But gambling was the highlight of my weekend.
What?
No, I didn't.
I was antisocial this weekend.
I was very antisocial this weekend.
That was kind of the theme of my whole week, was antisocialness.
That's all right.
All right, you guys are sick of hearing about us, I'm sure.
We're going to come back.
We're going to take a break.
We're going to come back, and we're going to talk about some Bomani news going on out there right now.
We've got some news on 2DX9 style going on, and we've got some news on Ultramix 2, kind of, sort of.
Even though the game's already out, we have some more news on Ultramix 2 that's all been developing throughout today, in fact.
No, no Song Pack 8 yet, and...
All sorts of other stuff that we can come up with.
Plus, Jamie has something she wants to share with you guys, too.
I'm not really sure how we're going to do this on air, how this is going to translate to radio, but you seem to have something already planned, Jamie, for our listeners.
Webcam.
And it's a follow-up to last week, right?
It is a follow-up to last week.
I'm glad you brought up the webcam.
www.orangeloungeradio.com
And you can see our webcam.
Also, don't forget to join our chat room while you're there.
And we are a fully interactive program.
Check out the Skype line while you're there as well.
Click on Interact With Us to find out more information about that.
We will open up the Skype line a little later in the show for you guys so you can interact with us.
Indeed.
Also, when we get back from this break, announcement.
Big, huge, Orange Launch Radio announcement that could change the future of everything as we know it.
We'll be back after this.
Yeah, somebody's going to be fired for good.
Donald Trump is swinging by.
All right.
More 2DX Red music in this break, starting it off with a little bit of Akira Yamaoka.
Thank you very much.
We'll be back.
S, Actdeft,
Thank you for watching!
Thank you for watching
Thanks for watching!
and many more.
From the Step Squad to Orange Lab, this PDR sucks!
We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio.
Hope you enjoyed that break of some 2DX Red music.
Now that the OST is out, you can really take a second look at a lot of those songs.
It really just shows you how much the quality of an MP3 or the quality of a rip can really affect...
The way you perceive a song.
For instance, what would be a song... Well, I would say EVO 66 was one of those songs.
We played that one a little bit earlier in the show.
That was one of those songs that when I heard the soundboard rip or the one from the game, I was just kind of like, oh, that sounds okay.
But then when I was listening to the soundtrack on it, I was like, oh, this is kind of groovy.
It really kind of thumps a lot more.
I guess because you get more of the bass and the fullness of the sound.
This is a really thumping song.
And considering I live too far away from any 2DX Red machines, so I haven't really gotten to play the actual machine, this is the only way I kind of get to live 2DX Red.
Where are they around here?
I think there might be one at Sviggle last I heard, but I know Arcade Infinity has one for sure.
Oh, you got them both.
So you could play them.
You want to play one side by side or something?
Play EVO 66.
Play a little clip of that one.
Just jump in the middle of the song.
Play a little bit.
What's down there at the bottom?
Techno.
Techno.
There it is.
Play a little clip of that.
See how it's kind of like...
I don't know.
Pause it for a minute.
Pause it for a minute.
Stop for a minute.
Okay, because you just played the soundtrack one side by side.
Okay.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Sure, it sounds just fine at 112.
You can understand everything perfectly.
But at 192, it's like, oh my god.
It sounds just like the CD.
Anyway.
Let's see.
What else was I going to bring up here?
Big news for Orange Lounge Radio.
I don't want to spill too much.
However, sometime before the end of the month, we're officially going to be making some big changes to the station.
Big changes.
Big changes.
Radio Kake?
I don't want to say too much more, but we're going to freshen up Orange Lounge a little bit.
For those of you that said that Orange Lounge is getting too stale.
We're going to freshen things up around here a little bit.
FDS?
We don't have an official... Yeah, we're going to spray some FDS on our station.
Because it needs it.
But we'll announce an official date soon.
So stay tuned to our website, OrangeLoungeRadio.com for more details.
We can just go ahead and tell them that we were...
with all the original content removed.
Yeah, except all of us will have been fired and, like, you know, maybe the FU segment's still intact.
That'll be the one thing they keep.
That'll be it.
And don't talk about Bomani anymore.
Yeah.
And we won't ever talk about Bomani anymore.
We'll only talk about country music.
And all of us will be replaced by busty Asian chicks and American Idol rejects.
And, uh... That'll be it.
Loki needs a spin-off show.
You should put an ad in the paper, try to get some bustiation chicks over here once a week, and just talk.
So, how are they doing today?
Good, good.
That's right, bounce a little bit.
Yeah.
Today we're going to play some DDR.
Yeah, it'll be great radio, Loki, it'll be excellent radio.
I know the folks at home can't see her naked writhing around on the DDR pad, but I can guarantee that she's doing it.
Yeah.
Go for that AAA.
Oh yeah.
Slower.
Slower.
This is why radio porn never took off.
Yet radio on the phone, or radio on the phone, sex on the phone is still, you know.
That's interactive.
That's bi-directional.
We're an interactive program.
Yes, Skype sex, Skype phone sex, that would be... Crap, I gotta go patent that now.
Alright, moving right along.
Let's talk about some stuff going on in the Mimani world.
I was gonna point this out.
There's an interesting thread going on over on DDR Freak right now, and it has to do with Ultramix 2.
And one of the moderators over there, Cutress...
DarkSakura, Luke, Carameldansen
everything on the site and put in all these different combinations of letters and he noticed that if you put in CRZY underscore TH it actually pulls up a banner and it's not this is on Konami of Hawaii's site it's actually a banner that says Crazy in Love by Beyonce and it's got it's own cute little artsy pattern so what the hell is this song banner doing on Konami of Hawaii's site?
don't know
Looks like why did Apple have a PowerBook G5 link?
Could it be that maybe I just got disconnected from IRC?
I don't know.
I'll try to get back in there.
Are you guys still on IRC?
Yeah, there was a big split.
Oh, I got kicked from chat completely, so I'll try to get back in.
Could it be that they were songs that were supposed to be there, and now they're not there anymore?
Don't know.
But they're on the site.
In My Dreams by Nomi
That's a licensed song, you guys.
It's not the same In My Dreams that was in Dance Maniacs, but it's actually a commercial song.
And aren't you lucky?
I have a little clip of it, actually.
If I can find it.
I'm looking right now.
I know I had it somewhere.
Here's a little clip of that song.
Because some folks even on the thread were asking, what in the hell is that song?
This is it.
This is In My Dreams by Nomi.
So interesting that banners exist, not just for that song, but for the Crazy in Love, Beyonce, yet neither one appears to have any connection to Ultramix 2.
How do you think to do something like that?
I gotta hand it to Cutress.
I mean, sure, I've heard of scanning directories to see if there's files in there that aren't linked or something like that, but to figure out that
Gee, there's a pattern.
Maybe there's songs missing.
I guess maybe what he was doing is he was trying to look for the banners for Song Pack 8, maybe.
I'm thinking maybe that was it, and then stumbled across this instead.
I don't know, but hats off to him.
Crazy.
Anyway.
So, more to develop on now.
I guess we will see what happens.
Are they going to end up in a song pack?
Who knows?
Alright.
Moving on.
I also want to talk about something that's going on with Beatmania 2DX Night Style Consumer.
That's a big thing that's going on right now.
This is interesting, is that Night Style is going to be coming out next month, but there's going to be, get this, seven different ways to buy 2DX for Night Style.
Seven different packages that Konami Style is putting out.
Nightstyle plus a Benefit CD, a Visual Emotions 2 DVD that you can just buy by itself.
Nightstyle plus the CD, plus Visual Emotions 2, plus a poster.
That's going to run you about $100.
Nightstyle plus a Benefit CD, plus V-Rare 10, plus poster.
And then just all these combinations.
There's Visual Emotions 2, poster, V-Rare 10, and then all these goodies together.
My gosh, there's a gazillion different ways you can buy this.
It almost sounds like something Nintendo would do.
There's the one at the bottom there.
Nightstyle, Benefit CD, VRare 10, member of B4U, and a poster.
And that's going to run you about $200.
Yes, you could actually buy yourself a member of B4U.
That's lovely.
To torture?
It sounds like something that... Yes, there's a keychain.
Translation that was posted to the live journal community, BM underscore 2DX.
This is very nice.
Beatmania 2DX, it seems, in order to put out, it is the portable strap which finishes the whole... Remember, this is English here.
With the metal material and the good set which designs the various designs of 2DX as the sticker.
The metal portable strap, the mark of 2DX stamped in the metal plate.
In addition, the yearning AAA mark of the user is stamped on plate back.
So in other words, they're going to have this kind of AAA keychain, it sounds like.
Some of the songs that are going to be on Visual Emotions, too.
Some of the videos that are going to be on it.
Doll, Lucy, Space Fight, Quasar.
So a lot of the newer songs.
But then it kind of goes back to some of the old ones, too.
Summer Vacation, 2DX, the song from, what, Fizz Style?
Burn in the Floor, Leading Cyber.
Doesn't this sound like something Nintendo would do, repackaging the same thing seven different ways?
It's like, you should buy seven Game Boy Advances so you can have them all in different colors.
Wouldn't that be fabulous?
How many iMac colors are there?
Yeah, exactly.
It's like an iMac.
Jamie, you're going to get Night Style, right?
I'm debating.
Are you going to go for one of these frilly combinations if you do it?
I'm debating.
Probably just going to get the game.
Maybe it'll be rare.
Are you going to do the one where you can buy a member of B4U?
No, that's okay.
Not unless I get to, you know, abuse and, you know, maybe draw on her with a Sharpie or something.
You know, like, I don't really care about the Visual Emotions CD or whatever it is.
You know, the Benefits CD might be cool, because it might be, I think it might be the live performance or whatever they did.
You know how they do those, you know, invitation-only concerts and crap.
I think that's probably what it is, the second one of those.
But, yeah, it'd be rare.
Just like the audio CDs there, you know, coming with that.
And of course, you know, the consumer tracks that will be on 2DX9, so that'll be cool.
Hmm.
This is interesting.
This just in, and it goes back to the topic we were talking about previously.
Literally, just in.
El Mullet posted this in chat.
It says, use the letters S-C-A-N in that whole Konami of Hawaii site thing with the hidden banners.
If you use scan, S-C-A-N, as the letters, mystique, scandalous.
That's a song I've heard at the club a few times.
That's definitely a big licensed song.
I know that song.
Very interesting.
Very interesting.
All hidden away on Konami of Hawaii's site for some reason.
Who knows?
And of course, Jason in our chat room, our resident, one of our many internet geeks we have to listen to this show, is kind of, is talking about what?
He found the banner for A. I was just randomly typing in letters.
I did A, A, A, A, and I found A. Well, we all know that A's in the game already.
I know, but I mean, I was just randomly typing in letters.
Yeah, yeah, it works.
But he says that if you think about it, every DDR version, you remember the master song list?
Loki's talked about this on the show before in the past.
If you haven't listened to the show in a while, you probably never heard this.
But basically, every DDR song has this four-letter code and some kind of master list of songs that's out there.
And is there a connection between that list and the fact that the way these files were named, the songs happen to have a four-letter link to them?
So maybe they were kind of, who knows, linking that all together.
Very interesting.
Very, very, very interesting.
Oh my gosh, look at this.
What are they doing?
Somebody must be running it right now.
El Mullet just said, use the letters P-A-R-T and you get this song.
Pink, get the party started.
You guys know Pink, right?
Wasn't that a Pump song?
Yeah, there's a bump song.
Weird.
Weird stuff.
You're already here first.
For some reason, Pink, Beyonce, Mystique, they're all lurking on Konami of Hawaii's site.
Is there a big song pack planned for the future?
Who knows?
Who knows?
Interesting.
Let's see, where to go to now?
I think we'll take a break.
GIGADELIC
Gigadelic?
Like a gigabyte?
Gigadelic.
We'll be back after this.
Thank you for watching!
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Orange Lounge Radio we put your thing down flip it and reverse it we are back here on Orange Lounge Radio
You should see our chatroom.
They're going crazy trying to come up with all these four-letter combinations now to try and figure out what else they can find on the site.
Even though, apparently, there's a script that's running, I think it was running for a while and then it stopped.
Cutter's made a post about he had to stop it and he's thinking about starting it again.
That's not stopping people in our chatroom from going and trying to figure out all the four-letter combinations.
Now somebody's trying to dig up a master list so they can go through all the four letters.
I wouldn't know anything about that.
God damn, you people got time on your hands.
It's beautiful.
It's crazy how obsessed people are with DDR.
Maybe not necessarily obsessed with DDR, but just... Pointing the finger?
Yeah, solving the mystery.
There's a little bit of a thrill of it, I think.
It's kind of neat.
Matt?
Or Loki?
I was going to say that there were a few four-letter codes I think I had posted on our site a long-ass time ago, but if you look in the news archives, you probably can find it.
So, anyways.
Very interesting.
Yeah, I think if you do a news archive search, there is a master list somewhere.
They were numeric.
Yeah.
And they didn't work.
The numeric codes don't work.
Oh, they don't.
Interesting.
I tried about six or seven of them.
Well, some folks are going crazy and trying to find something out.
Good luck, you guys.
And if you find out more, tell us so we can spoil the news on air for everybody.
What news it is, we don't know.
Just, you know, hey, this song banner's sitting here in a directory not being used for anything.
Probably don't mean shit, but... Boy, isn't it funny what Konami keeps on their site?
I wonder what other kind of goodies Konami has on their site.
Maybe they've got, like, top secret documents and stuff all hidden on their website.
Who knows?
Anyway, we're going to open up the Skype line for those of you guys who want to give us a call.
Just go to www.OrangeLoungeRadio.com, click on Interact With Us, and you can read all about how you, yes, you, the listener, can call us.
We're ghetto, you see, and we can't afford an 800 number, really, so we have you call us using this fancy little internet program.
So, do that.
Legend of Zaku
Let me see.
He's trying to figure out any other banners that I can actually guess.
It's just not a Skype line segment if Zaku doesn't hammer the lines and get in first, man.
It's crazy.
It's just luck, man.
I just managed to hit it first.
Apparently, yeah.
Now there's a bunch of people trying to get in right now, but you got in there first.
Lucky you.
Why, is my question.
Why are you hammering the site trying to find all these different letter combinations?
Think about it.
I mean, if you find it, then you'll probably be the first one to know.
You know, and then you'll be tempted to just, you know, spread the news.
And then, you know, if it gets to that point where Konami finds out what we're actually doing, then it might be a problem.
But...
What exactly are you finding out?
That's the problem.
We have no idea what we're finding out.
No, we're just finding out banners.
I mean, possibly we could find out whatever might be on the next songpacks.
It could also just be somebody fucking with us.
It could be somebody fucking with us.
That could be it, completely.
Somebody's just fucking with you.
That could be true.
You know, Cutris is a great guy, but he's a mod on DDR Freak.
What a perfect person to be in cahoots with Konami, right?
Yes.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
It's real simple.
We already know that some of the good licenses we managed to figure out and I'm surprised at how far Konami is going and we don't even know to what extent they are going to.
Yeah, you're right.
We don't know.
The access for who's trying to or what files are trying to be loaded and all that stuff?
I mean the
No, the fact that we managed to uncover certain licenses that we thought Konami would never imagine getting.
Well, as far as I know, though, the webmaster of the Konami site there reads the DDR Freak thread.
She's going to wake up Monday morning and see this and meow.
Rename the files?
Well, probably the files are going to be gone at some point tomorrow.
The question is, if the files are deleted...
Then we know we found something we weren't supposed to find.
But what?
What cat and what bag was just let out?
We don't know.
I don't think they have anything on us.
I mean, they have nothing on us.
We just managed to find it because of dumb luck.
Either way.
Either way.
Even if these songs... Even if this whole thing was just set up to fuck with us and these songs never see the light of day, you bet... It's a Groundhog's Day thing.
That's true.
I don't know.
It depends.
I mean, it could go either way.
We're just basically taking stabs in the dark right now and we're hitting something.
I think that's a nice way to sum it up.
I mean, Konami, I can only thank Konami for basically trying at least to get some decent licenses compared to the ones that they did for Europe.
Beyonce, Beyonce, that's huge.
That is huge.
Crazy in Love by Beyonce, that is huge.
If that is going to be in one of the downloadable songpacks...
If that is going to be in one of the downloadable song packs, that is freaking huge.
And the first question people are going to ask probably will be, why the hell wasn't this in the game to start with?
But we don't know.
We don't know any of this.
Will our questions ever be answered?
Probably not.
That's another good question.
But I'll judge that song once I see the steps.
Well, yeah, it always comes down to that.
If they're like eight, like most of the new songs, like eight to nine, like most of the new songs are, then, you know, then I'll make my decision.
All right.
Until then, we can only just speculate.
Sounds good.
Anything else you want to share with us, Zaku?
That's about it.
All right.
I got other people trying to get in, so I'm going to have to let you go.
Um, bye.
All right.
Bye, Zaku.
Have a good one.
Later.
Huh.
You know, somebody in the chat room just pointed out something very interesting.
The chat room just died.
I know what you're doing.
You're all trying to hammer that site right now.
Okay, maybe not.
Maybe some of you guys had to go watch the last part of this stupid bowl and see what the Patriots won.
Who are the Patriots?
Who are they?
New England.
What?
New England.
Oh, New England.
Some team.
Like the whole part of that nation?
New England, all of them?
Oh, I'm totally not even paying attention to the Skype line.
There's another call coming in.
Let's go to it.
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
Hello, you are on Orange Lounge Radio.
You're soon to not be on Orange Lounge Radio.
I think we got a problem hearing you, buddy.
Make sure that your microphones turn on and all that.
Try talking to us one more time.
Can't hear you, buddy.
Sorry, we're going to have to let you go.
That's a bummer.
Let's go to here.
Oh, I think we got... Did we get it?
Hi, you're on Orange Sounds Radio.
Yo, Skye, Siggy here.
Hi, Siggy.
Ah, finally.
Real quick, I gotta offer one piece of advice to prospective people calling in.
If you're going to call the show, before you call us, add this username to your Skype list.
Give them a call.
Echo123.
It's Echo123.
And when you call that, you can hear yourself.
It's like literally an echo.
So you can tell if your Skype line is working or not.
So really good tip for you guys.
So give that a try.
Anyway, what's on your mind, Siggy?
Well, it's about night style.
Ah, yes, night style.
What's up with night style?
Don't get me wrong, great idea, great concept, a lot of people there need help.
But, you know, there's other good organizations out there to donate to, too.
That's all I want to say.
Yeah.
So, have you seen the cover art for Night Style?
I did see the cover art for Night Style, but I didn't show it to the other people in studio.
And now I have no idea where the box art went.
That's because Rob's lousy.
I know, I'm horrible.
I will dig it up, though, the box art.
What did you think of the box art?
Well, it's really fine to me, actually.
Everybody at the Monty Stall has been complaining about it.
You know what?
And when I looked at it, it looked fine to me, too.
I don't know what the people are bitching about, really.
It's better than some of the other ones, I think.
They're actually buying what's in the game, not what's on the cover, right?
Very good point.
Here it is, for those of you in the studio.
Actually, I can post this as well, ha ha ha, in our chat room.
Here is a picture of the 9th style cover.
What do you guys think of that?
It looks a lot like Loki's head.
It looks cool.
That's kind of rad.
Yeah.
I don't see the problem with it.
I mean, they've got your mandatory DJ girl on it, so... Yeah, Iroha and Eri.
Uh-huh.
Are those the two new characters in 9th Style?
Yeah, they're the 2DX DJs representing 9th Style.
That's what I thought.
Iroha and Eri.
That's what I thought, and it looks fine to me.
Look at that, it looks like she just got a manicure today.
You know, those people who have been complaining, they were thinking of the actual poster as the cover art for Night Style.
Oh, because that was the poster as well?
It's supposed to be the poster.
So Konami got a little lazy, who cares?
Yeah.
I'm happy as hell that we're getting Night Style in the first place.
If they're going to get a little sloppy and make the poster the same thing as the cover art, I don't care.
It's a fine picture.
I would be more much happy if they put a reincarnation back on Night Style.
Aren't they supposed to be bringing a bunch of songs back?
Actually, I already mentioned to you last time that there would be three songs that would mostly come back.
Right, well, because aren't there songs that have new anothers that need to be accounted for?
Yeah.
Jam, Screams, Minimalian, and Checking You Out.
Right, right, okay, that's right.
Hmm.
Well, it sounds like it's going to be a good mix either way.
I can't wait to hear more details.
I can't wait to see that full song list.
And what I really want to see, I want to see if we get any more preview tracks from 10th and 11th, and I want to see, and I know it's red, but I'm calling it 11th, I want to see if there are good preview songs.
I want Kachak!
I want Kachak!
AGEHA!
AGEHA!
AGEHA!
All right, well, you've been listening to the show long enough.
You know I'm really white when it comes to my pronunciation.
Yeah, but I'm always here to help you out.
Well, I appreciate it.
It's the beauty of the Skype line.
I can be corrected almost in person.
It's great.
You can be corrected in person.
Yeah, when Jamie isn't here to correct me in person, you are.
It's beautiful.
Shut up.
Yeah.
And there's another one that you mispronounced it a lot.
You know, the artist, the cheer train, it was actually Fujita Blender.
Fujita.
Yeah.
I like Fusita.
All right.
We're going to let you go because we're getting other calls and I want to let you get back to that AOL conversation you're having in the background.
All right?
All right.
Have a good one.
Later.
Bye.
We got another call.
We'll take one more call and maybe we'll go to Cage Match after this.
I don't know.
Please.
All right.
What, you don't like talking to people on the Skype line?
I like talking to people, but I'm ready for the cage match.
Oh, you want to bring it on.
Well, I just don't really care.
Alright, let me get to this person here.
It's already been brought in.
Let me get to this poor person who's sitting here on the Skype line waiting for us to acknowledge their presence.
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
Hey, Sky, it's El Mullet again.
Hello, El Mullet.
What is going on?
You guys are just digging through Konami's site right now.
You're posting all these crazy banners.
What's going on?
Well, all these crazy banners equal two that I found.
Hey, that's more than I found.
I just put in two random words and I pulled out two things.
I have no idea.
So you're trying to think of like four letter words that might come up with something.
Yeah, something like that.
Wow, and you found two.
What do you think this all is?
What do you think this all adds up to?
I wouldn't read too much into it personally.
I mean, I'm sure that there's some sort of explanation why we've managed to pull up five licensed songs.
I'm thinking maybe, you know, they were there, but now they're not there, you know.
Five songs?
Five songs in a song pack?
Loki, Loki's tapping my leg for some reason.
It might be noticed, or I might mention that not only...
by putting into those directories are you pulling up stuff from Ultramix 2 but Ultramix 1 so I could theorize it could be also Ultramix 3 now that's a good thought there maybe these are possible Ultramix 3 songs or Ultramix 7 by doing the same thing so that's Ultramix 1 interesting because we all know Ultramix 3 has to happen at this point it has to has to happen and if it doesn't happen there will be burnination going on
I'm going to mount all this banner finding.
Remember when a picture was leaked that had the Take It to the Morning Light banner from DDR Max and it had an SP4 icon on it?
I remember that.
I remember that.
And it didn't mean shit.
Yeah, it didn't mean shit.
What we could be pulling up right now could very well not be meaning shit at all.
But then again... They're pretty banners.
That Crazy in Love banner is kind of cute.
I need that song.
I need to play it Tuesday.
I have plenty of...
Yeah, maybe we'll grab a little clip of it off the iTunes store.
How could anybody have not heard Crazy in Love, though?
Seriously.
Our listeners, you've got to be living in a cave if you've never heard Crazy in Love.
It's just my spin teacher plays that in spin class, and it's fun.
Hold on.
I'm sorry, Elmola, but now Jamie's got me on a different subject here.
We've got to play a little clip here.
Here it is.
Here it is.
Come on.
Don't you want to shake your booty?
This is the part I like.
Oh, I'm sorry.
I totally cut it off right there.
Those could be cool little gallops.
Come on.
That would have been a great DDR song.
I hope the Ultramix 3 thing is the case.
Or a song pack, but we'll see.
I have a feeling that we're being fucked with, and it doesn't mean shit.
Not only were we pulling licensed banners, we also pulled two Konami original banners.
Cutris pulled off GMD and Hold On Me.
That's right.
So who knows where that's going.
So that's seven songs, so it's not a true song pack.
That's true.
So there's more than five.
So who knows what's going on.
I'm sure an explanation will be offered, you know, eventually.
Like how Song Pack 8 is going to be released eventually.
You know that if trying to find something secret that you're not supposed to see on some website is involved, Loki's in on it.
Anything else you want to share with us, Amolet?
That's pretty much it.
This is the big topic of conversation right now, after all.
You know what?
Unfortunately, the way things work in the Mamani scene is it seems like now we're getting in this rhythm of getting all our games at the end of the year in the Christmas season, which makes everything post-Christmas to E3 a real dead period.
But that's why we talk about other stuff, too.
What can we say?
Exactly.
All right.
Hey, plug your site.
InsidePulse.com.
Visit it.
Love us, damn it.
Love us.
But not too much.
Not too much.
I mean, love us to the extent of you're not being creepy about it.
All right.
Sounds good.
So visit Inside Pulse and read the Elmullet column.
Actually, it's not called the Elmullet column, though.
But look for it.
It's great.
Alright, thanks for the call.
Bye.
Have a good one.
I can't explain it.
It's crazy.
All right.
As a reminder, you guys, to participate in this next segment, you're going to want to be in our chat room, www.orangeloungeradio.com.

It is time for the Orange Lounge Radio Cage Match.
Last week in the Orange Lounge Radio Cage Match, it kind of surprised us because Echo Image was given the boot from the Cage Match, and it was replaced by...
Dream, that's right, J-pop artist Dream, with their rendition of Night of Fire, the song you might recognize from 2DX, Parapara.
It was Jamie's pick, so that's going to be the first song you guys hear tonight.
As a reminder, the way the cage match works, you hear three songs.
One of them you hear a clip of.
It's the song that won last week.
Two songs you hear brand new in their entirety.
And you're going to pick your favorite and the winning song goes into rotation all week long on Orange Lounge Radio's Bomani Music and More program.
You get the vote.
So here it is.
Song number one you get to pick from tonight.
Last week's winner, Dream, Night of Fire.
Thank you for watching!
More deeply, I want to know the truth of you Don't say sweet, kind words Because it will stain my heart and make me feel like crying
Night of Fire, I'm so happy to be with you.
Night of Fire, I want to feel fate with you.
Night of Fire, I can't say it, but there are days when I want you to hug me.
Night of Fire, I'm attracted to you.
Night of Fire, I don't know what to do.
Thanks for watching!
Alright, song number one in tonight's cage match, last week's winner, Dream, Night of Fire.
Will it win again?
We'll see.
We've got to bring in two challengers, though, first.
First up, my pick, yay, me.
I'm going to pick a band that has won the cage match a couple times.
It's a real popular band amongst, I think, the folks that play DDR, although it's not a DDR band.
Yeah.
Yay, Freeze Pop.
Enjoy.
I know you work across the street in the indie record store.
I'm thinking someday that we'll meet.
I'm thinking we'll do something more.
I hide behind my magazine.
Then I see you walk on by.
I'm not ready to be seen.
I'll just
I'm on a stakeout I'm on a stakeout I'm on a stakeout
Thank you for watching!
The feeling is elating, biding my time Yeah, I know that you'll soon be mine Soon to mine Can't let you see me Can't let you see me Can't let you see me
All right, first challenger tonight, song number two, Freeze Pop, Stake Out.
Did that song stick out in your mind, or would you like to take it out to the trash?
Jamie.
Jamie.
I like Freeze Pop, but that song just didn't do it for me.
Still, it was a good song, so they get a 7.
Alright, 7 from Jamie.
Bugs!
Can't hear you, you gotta practically give head to that mic, you gotta get that close.
There you go, now talk.
I like Freeze Pop, I give it a 9.
Perfect.
Okay, good.
Angel!
Angel!
I don't give a shit, you know what?
I hate that fucking song.
It's awful.
It gets a 1.
AWFUL!
I'm sorry, talking over synthesizers is not fucking music.
Awful.
At least it's not a negative number.
Don't give my BS.
Yes, whereas a song that is over synth to all hell, so it's GROSS, GROSS, GROSS, is music.
Did I never... I never said it was good when I put it in, okay?
Yeah.
Last time I checked, you're supposed to like the songs, at least somewhat, that you are going to put in the cagement.
Call me crazy.
Maybe you missed that memo.
Crazy.
All right.
Anyway.
Anyway.
My thoughts on Freeze Pop.
I feel completely opposite from Loki.
I think the minimalist synth sound that they have, I think that is what makes them so cool.
And I love her voice, because she has this very, I don't care what you all think type thing in your voice.
I love her voice.
And the pop culture references are awesome, but they're not cheesy.
Like, I've heard bands with cheesy pop culture references.
It's bad.
They're good.
Yeah.
Yeah, so I would give them like, I would give it like seriously like an 8.5, maybe a 9, 8.75, let's give it an 8.75, I like it a lot.
Alright, let's get to song number 3, which is Loki's pick, what did he pick?
Doesn't matter, it sucks.
Thank you, thank you.
No, what I picked was, it was actually a song I had heard a while ago and I had downloaded just recently.
for the hell of it, because I like the song.
It's another freeze-pop song, isn't it?
No, it's not a freeze-pop song, thank God.
Thank God for that.
Shit.
No, this is The Killers with Somebody Told Me.
And it would be perfect for Guitar Freaks.
Alright, Loki says this is his Guitar Freaks song that he would like to see.
The Killers, Somebody Told Me, song number three.
Enjoy.
Enjoy.
I'm breaking my back just to know your name Seventeen tracks and I'm hiding with this game
Thank you for watching!
DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft
Just have it ain't close in a place like this I said I have it ain't close in a place like this Bring it back down, bring it back down tonight Never thought I'd better leave my room in my blue night Somebody told me you had a boyfriend Who looked like his girlfriend
I said baby, baby, please But I just don't know now We all want to see you cry
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
Alright, that was song number three, The Killers, Somebody Told Me.
Will we tell you to vote for that one or not?
Even though it's not our decision, it's yours.
But we'll tell you our opinion anyway.
Jamie?
I like that song.
It gets a nine.
I thought I've heard another version of it before, but since I don't listen to the radio, this is pretty new to me, so I like it a lot.
Alright.
Bug?
I can't hear you, buddy.
Yeah, I know.
Negative 7.
I've been hearing it all week.
Angel.
It's pretty good.
What are you rocking?
Eight and a half.
This, boys and girls, let this be a lesson to you.
If you're thinking right now that this song is overplayed, it's time for you to turn off the radio.
Seriously.
And start listening to internet radio and other forms of entertainment that's out there.
LOKI
Night of Fire Night of Fire More deeply Your...
And song number two, Freeze Pop, Stakeout.
And song number three that you can vote for tonight, The Killers, Somebody Told Me.
Somebody told me that I'm living without you.
I'm ready, let's roll on to something new.
Alright, place vote now.
Send a private message to Sky in the chat room with your vote and we'll add it all up and let you guys know who the winner is.
Song number one, song number two, or song number three.
Meanwhile, Orange Lounge Radio moves right along and I gotta ask Loki a question I ask Loki every week.
What the hell's going on in the sim scene now?
Anything?
I don't think so, really.
Other than just people, you know, being afraid about, you know, DRA coming after them for downloading sim files and that type of thing.
Still, the websites are down.
DDR Mania X and DDR UK.
One of the
2 of the big 3 that are out there are down.
And last week I mentioned there was a bunch of different sort of food mix type packs you can download or
Check out, and once again, those are on the forums for Bill Monty's style.
You can find those.
Really, nothing's been going on.
I think everyone's been just gearing up for Super Bowl or something like that.
Because, really, there's nothing out there.
I'm sure you'll see some more coming out, though, for the 2DX...
Red stuff that's come out because obviously now that the OST rips aren't out there you can you know bet that there's going to be some of those sim files coming out but besides that really nothing else going on it's been just quiet and dead like all the websites so that's up that's everything kinda sucks
You know, is it just that the sim file authors are using the Super Bowl as an excuse to have more time to look at Asian porn on the internet?
I don't know why you'd want to look at Asian porn since Asian porn is censored, but sure, I guess.
We can't see Loki's screen for a minute.
Let me rephrase.
Porn with big-tittied Asian girls.
Okay, that's completely acceptable then.
Can't.
What was the one that I got from DarkSound?
FinalFuckX was actually the first Asian full-on porn from Asia I'd actually seen.
It was cosplay porn.
Yes, it was cosplay porn with characters from Final Fantasy.
Didn't we actually do this on the show?
I want to say we actually played this on the show on an earlier episode.
We didn't?
No, maybe way back in the day.
We did it as part of an afterbirth.
We did the Dance Dance part.
Porn, though.
I remember Loki gave his review of the Dance Dance Porn, or what was it called?
You remember Dance Dance Fuck or something?
Something like that.
I have it buried under here on my desk somewhere.
Because I remember after I bought it or whatever, I watched it once and I go, okay, this is interesting, and then just kind of tossed it.
And, you know, it became part of the mass collection of stuff on my desk.
I...
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
For those that are unfamiliar out there, and I will show, this is more for the in-studio folks, there is DDR porn out there.
Sadly enough, there is porn that exists.
No, there's porn that's out there.
And if you go here to the, but myself, image porns, and we go to the not work safe category here, we can see that there are some actual, you know...
Oh my god!
Get a life!
All of you!
Get a life!
Those of you people posting on this board, what the hell is wrong with you?
You're drawing pornography to... Ugh!
It's just 4chan, get over it.
Head hurts.
Head hurts.
Jamie, surely you have something to add on this.
It's just 4chan.
It's all things hentai.
But it's DDR-ish characters.
It looks like somebody drew that one.
It looks like somebody painted that one.
It said Max... Look!
Colors!
Beatmania 2DX characters book for adults only.
Like, the song Colors, and you've got all these girls with big titties standing in front of Colors.
There goes the cover.
Oh, hooray.
Yowie.
Hooray, because that's any better.
Sigh.
Anyway, so the Dance Dance Porn or whatever it was, was... Huh?
Great.
What is that picture of Tran sitting there where you can totally see her clam?
What is that?
Her clam?
Wow, way to go there, Rob.
Welcome to the 90s.
I don't care.
Now they're all posting about it in the chatroom.
At least you got them to stop typing in random four-letter words.
Now this is going to get more ideas.
They're going to try, like, 4chan.
Is that the Orange Lounge characters naked?
What is wrong?
Seriously!
Post that link in the chatroom.
Can you post that link in the chatroom?
Yeah.
Somebody found a picture on these Bomani-style porn boards of the Orange Lounge characters from Mobomoga just naked.
Seriously, people, get out of the house.
If this is you posting this, this is your homework assignment.
You are to go outdoors and get at least three hours of fresh air this week.
And I want you to touch a real girl.
Make sure you have her permission first, and your mom doesn't count, okay?
I want you to actually go out and touch a real girl.
What is... Jamie, look at this one!
It's the chick from Poppin' Music!
Oh my god, I want to make an icon out of that!
I want a link to that.
I just need some heavy breathing to go along with all this.
Claire O'Neil says that the naked picture of tart and toffee should be our new banner for Orange Lounge.
We could do that.
We do have a site remodeling coming up.
Hey, how about that?
We'll just have that in our banner.
I've seen that picture before.
Forget it, forget it.
I'm done.
I'm not going to talk about pornography anymore on the radio.
This is pointless, people.
For the next five minutes.
Just look at what you missed out on, though, if you're not in the chat room.
Alright, you guys want to know who won the cage match?
No.
No.
No?
Yeah?
Alright, let's hear who won tonight's cage match.
The winner of tonight's cage match is... Freeze Pop!
Yay, we get to kill Loki!
Freeze Pop wins tonight.
And Loki's mad at me.
Alright.
Alright.
Let's go to a break, shall we, boys and girls?
We're going to go to a break, and in this break we've got to get ourselves some more 2DX music.
from 2DX Red, because the soundtrack, if you didn't hear, we've been talking about this all night, the soundtrack to 2DX Red came out this week, aka 2DX 11th Style, that's what I've been calling it.
I know that's not the real name, and I also don't care, by the way.
So we've been playing some songs from that all night long, so we're going to keep that up.
I think what we will play in this break, what are we going to do?
Um...
I want to play, actually, there's a really good song by Soda Fujimori that I want to play.
I like that song, so we're going to start it off with that.
It's called The Hope of Tomorrow, so we're going to start it off with that.
Maybe we'll do some DJ Simon in this break as well.
Did we do Don't Be Afraid Myself yet?
I don't think we did, so we have to do Don't Be Afraid Myself because I like that song.
More Freeze Pop.
No, no more Freeze Pop tonight.
And I guess, should we do the Politary one?
Why not?
I'm feeling risky tonight.
We're going to do... It's not Naoki.
It's June featuring Paula Terry.
So have a little hope.
We're going to see how that is.
Raspberry Heart.
Alright, we're going to play all those songs and we'll be back after this.
Thanks for watching!
Thank you for watching!
Thanks for watching!
Yeah!
C'mon, let's go!
You say you're a gift from my heart, but I may be too short and I've got to begin.
Sometimes it's tough, a little bit lonely or lonely.
I'm not a game of chess, but you're my heart.
You're only what you give, and that's what I should learn.
You know what to do for you, my mystery heart.
I wanted to be the one to keep up with you Why I can't stop with being left behind
Gaming Radio, so uncensored.
and even Tom Brokaw could get a job with us.
Orange Lounge Radio.
We're back.
Sorry about that.
That last song got cut off a little bit.
I'm sure none of you guys minded that much because it was Politary.
I'm kidding.
But apparently one of my macros in IRC happens to control my Winamp, and that is why I'm not going to install more of these crappy scripts into my MRC anymore.
So apologies for that.
But at least you got a little taste there of Politary.
June featuring Politary with Raspberry Heart.
And I so wasn't ready to come back from break.
Damn it.
Oh, well, that's all right.
What we're going to do now is... Do we have the TV thingy hooked up?
Do you need some time to get that done?
Or is it already hooked up?
For what she's got?
Well, I just don't know how to set it up.
That's good, we're good to go.
Alright, Jamie wants to share with us another follow-up to something from last week.
This has been a running thing for like two weeks now.
Well, Jamie, I'll let you set this up for the listeners.
What's going on here?
I brought the Japanese version of Dracula X to Nocturne in the Moonlight that came out over here as Castlevania Symphony of the Night.
I brought the Precursor.
I brought with me Dracula X for the PC Engine Duo.
So this is kind of neat, because she actually had to bring her whole little system here, a Turbo Duo, which is ages old for a game system.
It's like one of the first CD systems.
It's like we're having a classic gaming expo in my house right now.
It's awesome.
This game goes for eBay from anywhere between $150 to $350.
We actually didn't pay for ours.
It was used to pay us back when someone owed us $100.
Yikes!
She picked it up for us in Japan for about $100.
Okay.
Wow.
I'm turning it on now.
And be watching the webcam.
Okay, so if you want to check out the webcam, go to www.orangelandrita.com.
The webcam's right there.
So look at it, people.
View the old schoolness of the Super CD-ROM 2 system.
Of course, if you're listening to us on like a rebroadcast or something, such as the one that happens on DDR Freak Radio every Friday night, you don't get to participate along with the webcam because it's not going on right now, but at least you get to hear us kind of talk about it.
So now I noticed the boot up screen here for this system you've got.
It says Super CD-ROM 2 system, but it says CD-ROM squared.
What the hell's the 2?
I think it's because it's a dual speed CD.
Oh my gosh, it's lightning fast then.
It's a dual speed CD.
It's a Saturn.
Amazing, it's blazing fast.
Anyway, I'm going to go ahead and let the whole intro play through because it's in German.
And our listeners want nothing more than to hear German right now, I'm sure.
I might skip through some of it, but I can't hear it.
Remember the old Konami sound?
Up, up, down, down, left, right, left, right.
So what is this part all about here, DarkSakura?
They're sacrificing virgins to bring back Dracula.
Awesome.
There's the virgin.
This is awesome because it's German with Japanese subtitles.
And I hope people are saving these for me, please.
We want you to rule the world.
We are waiting for you, smiling, to overcome the decline.
After 100 years, the evil has risen again.
Uh, clarify something in the chat room because we don't have motion going on right now.
Is there a full motion video on this game?
It's fake motion.
You know, like... Like Ninja Gaiden cinematics.
Yeah.
It has some animation.
It's spread over stills.
Dracula!
Why do you feel the need to share this with our listeners?
Is this some kind of culture?
Because they need to be...
Educated in the ways of the old school.
What I love about this game is it has a lot of updated Castlevania themes in it.
Oh my god.
Well, updated for that time.
And I'll tell you what, for our chat room, I am willing to mp3 the whole CD for you.
This music really speaks to me.
It sends the message to me that Freepop is an actual music and it sucks!
That's what it says to me.
The way it looks on the webcam, it almost looks like the skeletons are dancing.
Yeah, thriller all of a sudden.
Shaun of the Dead.
Okay, so I'll play a little bit of it.
But you have to hear, though, Maria.
Because Maria is a playable character in this.
And she's a cheesy little girl in a pink dress.
That throws birds.
Yeah, what the hell is that?
That's, you know, maybe I'm just out of touch with the whole Castlevania slash Dracula series.
But what the hell is up with the throwing birds?
All the characters always had a whip or like a knife or something.
Richter gets the whole manly ending where he's marching out of the castle triumphant.
and Maria has one where she's being followed by her little animal friends skipping while there's happy music playing.
Jamie, stop making the grudge noise.
And also, this should sound familiar, though.
I always love that satanic church music that Castlevania games have.
See, for anyone who's ever played this on the Super Nintendo, it gives you a hint, but this is... You can tell that Symphony of the Night is definitely a sequel to this game.
You know, this would be good music to play, like, say, I don't know, before a certain wedding.
in a church.
Dude, that would be great.
I should play that before my wedding.
So let's see, do we want Maria?
Yes, sir!
Or do we want Richter?
That's good for Richter.
Maria sounded like Chun-Li there.
Yes, sir!
Well, she did go, yes, sir.
Alright.
I'll go ahead and start with whatever the hell this difficult level is.
I know, I should start with the very beginning.
Okay.
I'm being soothed by the music.
Hey, run away.
I'm not soothed.
Soothe me.
Okay.
Jamie's playing for a little bit here.
And then they ate the minstrels.
I get to fight death now.
Truckwagon!
So, in the game right now, Jamie is riding on a horseback and carriage or something.
The graphic, by the way, should look familiar at the beginning of Symphony of the Night.
And Van Helsing completely ripped his bean off.
I might add.
For people that said that Van Helsing was Castlevania the movie, screw you, because honestly, Van Helsing sucked, and a Castlevania movie would be awesome.
They would not do that to a Castlevania movie.
Actually, they would, that's the problem.
There were no flying vampire babies in Castlevania, as far as I'm aware.
Now, there were the flying monkeys, but the... Oh, the music is so good.
I also want people to pay attention if they happen to make it to the camp.
The opening graphic, you'll remember, is exactly the same as it was on Symphony of the Night.
Which is funny, because the opening graphic has a little upside-down blue triangle when you play as Richter.
But when you play as Maria, it's an upside-down pink triangle.
And for you fellow family, aka homos out there, you know what an upside-down pink triangle means.
I think I did play something very similar to this on Super Nintendo.
Also, Richter should look very familiar to everybody because it's exactly the same sprite used in Symphony of the Night.
It is.
It seriously is.
They actually changed the sprite for the Saturn version to look like his portrait.
Huh.
You know what?
I'm thinking to make this whole thing complete, next week you need to bring the Saturn and Nocturne and the Moonlight.
I'll do it.
I have a Saturn.
I have a few Saturns, actually.
I may have a completed save file on that one.
Awesome.
Now what I love about this part of the game, too, is it looks like she's actually going through the old town in Castle... Oh, and Jamie's saying it is the old town from Castlevania II, Simon's Quest.
So for those of you guys that are looking on the webcam right now, you're like, damn, it looks like the same graphics they had in Simon's Quest.
Well, it is.
It just sounds like a bunch of broken glass everywhere right now.
Whoa, hey, what was that?
As I mentioned before when we were watching her play this earlier, it sounds like the same sound effects from Mega Man.
But they're two different companies!
Mega Man is Capcom, Castlevania is Konami.
How the hell do you figure?
There's a hidden place that I can't get to with Richter.
Don't.
Anyway, Loki, Castlevania is Konami, Mega Man is Capcom.
They cannot share the sound effects.
The world would explode.
What the hell was that?
That was dinner.
Jamie says it was the gargoyle.
See, it's almost like being at somebody's house.
watching them play games, except in this case you have your back turned and you only get to look once every 30 seconds.
You just got to wonder what you're missing.
Oh, what happened?
The music stopped.
Oh, load time.
Make your own music.
Oh, here we go.
Are you fighting the boss right now?
Yeah, you died last time you fought this boss.
This sounds 8-bit.
This song sounds 8-bit.
Oh.
Excuse me.
Excuse me again.
I don't know what I ate.
Loki, stop that.
Okay.
Jamie died.
No, she's not dead yet.
Now she's... Did you hear that sound?
I swear to God that was the sound it made when you died in like Zelda.
You need the axe for this.
You always needed the axe for the first boss in any Castlevania game.
What's up with that?
Alright.
What?
Alright, Jamie's just trying to get to the next level so you can hear the music, because it is really awesome.
And then after that, we're going to go into the FUs of the week.
So you guys, by the way, if you're in our chatroom right now, you can send those FUs of the week.
Just send a private message to Sky in the chatroom with your FU.
Did you kill it?
She killed it.
Yay!
Here we get the disco ball.
What's up with the disco ball?
Like, the crystal that drops from the ceiling is like a little disco ball.
It's crazy.
Makes you want to dance.
Ooh, it's sparkling.
It's a sparkling disco ball.
And as you can see, it's a red ball with fire in it.
Well, the cam hasn't updated yet, so I can't see it, but... Sorry.
That's all right.
I know that noise.
Believe it or not, I actually like the first level music better on the Super Nintendo version, but all the rest of it's better.
Alright, now you have to hear the music at the beginning of the stage.
It's the whole reason we played this whole first stage.
I forgot I also have sound test open.
Sound familiar?
Yeah, it's the old school song from like Castlevania 1.
It's the first stage.
Awesome.
It was funny the way the bird squawked right at the pause in the song.
Alright.
Alright, we're going to wrap it up for this segment.
Wait, wait, what?
One more thing?
Oh, okay.
Um, I'm gonna actually play a song that I want to be in my effing music.
Okay.
Just for this once.
Okay, just for this once.
But I have to get to it, so.
Alright.
Well, I'm gonna turn down the volume until you get to that part.
Well, great.
What are we supposed to talk about in the meantime?
I have no idea.
Eesh.
Now what are we supposed to do?
Um, I'm just getting to the sound test.
Oh, okay.
Well, that won't take that long.
No.
Just because this is my favorite piece of music in the game.
And I forgot the sound test existed.
I guess what I'll do for a minute here while I queue up the FUs of the week, which, by the way, you guys should be sitting in.
I'll take a moment to plug our spinoff shows.
Monday night on Orange Lounge Radio, Diversion, the Orange Lounge Radio remix show.
A bunch of your favorite remixes.
Not only just... I can hear your computer, buddy.
Loki, your computer's coming out the... It is.
I hear it.
And so do our listeners.
Whatever you...
Whatever you're working on there, I just heard in my speaker.
Listeners, tell Loki you can hear it.
Try it again, try it again.
I don't hear it now.
I hear it.
Oh, no, that was the TV right there.
Okay.
Okay.
But I'm telling you, I heard whatever this thing was.
It's a, it's a, you're doing a, I can tell what it is.
Anyway.
Found it.
You guys don't care.
Anyway.
Not yet, not yet, not yet.
Keep it down.
God.
We're going to get into the FUs of the week.
Oh yeah, before I, I need to keep finishing up our spin-off programming.
I found music.
All right.
Tuesday night, pump up the volume, 7 o'clock.
Or what?
It says 7.30 for show, but 6.45-ish for pre-show.
Thursday night, outside the box, 7 o'clock.
When we feel like doing a show, we do one.
Alright, now we can do... Jamie, why do we have to do the FUs of the week every week?
Because we're angry, but this music is too happy to be angry about.
Ready?
Um...
I'm angry about the woman with the cookies.
Okay, this is the only thing I'm really angry about.
There was this, these couple of teenage girls, and I'll be posting a link in the chat room soon, but they went around their neighborhood passing out cookies and they were leaving them on doorsteps with surprises.
This one woman sued them for causing her anxiety because they knocked on the door, she didn't answer, and so they left them and ran as a surprise.
Well, they offered to pay her medical damages because she did apparently get checked into the hospital for nearly having a heart attack or something.
And, uh, instead, uh, she sued them for the punitive damages.
Well, she didn't win that, but she did win what the girls offered her anyway.
So, it's a big mess.
I'm going to post a link to that in my live journal.
Also, a big F-you to all of you school children who do not believe in the goddamn First Amendment.
There was a survey done that stated something like 80% of students, I think, should believe the government has control over our public media.
That's in direct violation of the First Amendment.
They also don't know how to properly dispose of the flag, either.
They think that flag burning is illegal.
I think that that's really stupid.
Just a big F you to general ignorance of damn near everybody.
And I blame their parents.
That's it.
Loki's turn.
Fuck you this cold, because I've had a sore throat for like an entire week, and that's really the only symptom that I have from that and being congested.
So, that kind of sucks, because talking on the phone all day at work, it just irritates it, and that's no picnic.
And then, fuck you to stupid, um, lame-ass people with cell phones.
God damn it, I want...
A law to be passed where people cannot drive with cell phones.
In fact, there was a fucking study done that people are more dangerous driving with cell phones than they would be intoxicated.
They're making it illegal.
Thank God!
Because you know what?
People can't fucking do it.
I've been in a car with you talking on your cell phone.
I just use speakerphone.
Doesn't matter.
Even with speakerphone, the reaction time is much worse.
The impending law, though, is supposed to make provisions for hands-free driving.
So, you know what?
So that goes for all you women out there driving those SUVs and with those stupid cell phones.
Ha!
You can't do it any longer.
To hell with you people.
Anyways.
Then also, um, fuck you, the goddamn Indian casinos.
Actually...
because, you know, I think it's quite funny that people go there and spend all their money, oh, look at this, this is nice, because they have, you know, all this, we can go gamble and stuff, but guess what, you don't win, they're just doing a reverse rapage on you, okay, they're just going to rape you of your money, because we raped them of their land, so, you know, I don't feel sorry for anyone that goes there and loses all their money, so to hell with them, and, um,
That'll be it.
My turn.
My first FU goes to Loki for having two FUs that were involving me somehow in some way, because A, I love talking on my cell phone while I drive, and I do it just fine, and B, I lost $75 at the casino last night, but I don't care, I had fun, and I won $100 the last time I was there.
But on that note, FU to the fact that I was not able to keep up my winning streak last night, that made me sad, but oh well.
I had fun while it lasted, even though it didn't last very long, but then again, neither do orgasms.
Um, what else would I give an F you to?
An F you to just, like, hangovers, that's a big one.
An F you to drama in general, because there's just drama sometimes, and it makes things messy, and that's all I can say about that, really.
Let's move on.
Let's talk to some of the other folks that are here in studio.
Angel.
Alright, F you to my instructor because I'm saying I did something that I didn't do.
And that's all that needs to be said about that.
F you to myself for not giving myself enough sleep during the week.
I think that happens to all of us at one point or another.
And other than that, not much because I'm not really that angsty.
But then again, when am I ever that angsty?
You've been like borderline angsty, I've seen.
Alright.
Uh, Bugged.
Just a nice little FU to Loki about freeze pop.
You dumb mob ass.
He just will not let that drop.
He will not drop the freeze pop grudge.
Oh boy.
No, we're not supposed to drop the mob ass.
Everyone's supposed to say it.
It's gonna be the next... Death Cake.
What the fuck's Death Cake?
Is that an Eddie Izzard?
Okay.
We brought up the cake or death with the vicar or die and death cake.
I thought you had a response to that, Loki.
That's why I gave you the mic.
All right, is that it, bugged?
Yeah.
All right.
Chat room time.
Let's see what the folks on chat room have to say.
Yeah, I know.
Who cares?
Illusion says F you to Jamster for just being Jamster and being on every commercial break.
You know who owns Jamster?
Who?
Verisign.
You gotta be kidding.
No, they're a subsidiary of Rare Science.
Jesus.
Okay, here you go, guys.
There's actually a petition on the internet to stop Jamster, and I would urge you all to sign it.
Even though I'm not huge on internet petitions, this is one I can believe in.
I don't care if it has, like, minimal impact.
If we can stop one Jamster commercial from airing, we've done our job.
Illusion also says, an F you to Shakey's, stopping their karaoke right before my friends and I got there so we didn't get to do Love Shack again.
Hey, that's the song that Iguana Girl and I always do, is Love Shack.
We did it on this show once, actually.
K.K.
Slider says, F you to Final Fantasy XI, taking my life.
I sympathize.
What, Jamie, what did you say to K.K.
Slider?
Addict.
Jamie says, Addict.
AZN Buddy Paul says, F you to Heartbreakers.
There have been like two gazillion breakups lately.
Maybe you're just a player.
Sephiroth1215 says, F you to No Service Pack 8 yet.
And no 2DX in America yet, even though I have a feeling it will be soon.
I always say Service Pack.
Song Pack 8.
Sephiroth 1215 also says, and F you for no outside the box once again.
I have more fun on that show.
Well, I'm sure the others are pleased to hear that.
What can I say?
Real life gets in the way sometimes.
We'll see.
We'll see what happens.
Legend of Zaku says, F you to the fact that I'm still unemployed.
F you to wasting away my body by not eating right, thus losing my stamina when playing DDR.
And F you to Valentine's Day coming up next week, and me still not having a valentine.
Jaded2005 says, F you to my computer for acting weird at the worst possible time yesterday while playing Doom 3.
And what time would that be?
Jeez.
I think I had one of those earlier.
Uh, the wet ones.
DarkLionXVI says, One FU for tonight.
FU to EvilNauki2DX for making me spit water on the wall so many times every time he sent me pictures.
Would those be 4chan pictures?
Well, usually I don't read FUs directed at certain people, but that, you know, I can tell that, you know, that's a light-hearted FU, so those are okay.
I know who won the Super Bowl movement, it was the Browns.
You're welcome.
I thought LankyStyle made the worst jokes possible.
Where do you think he learned them from?
TheXJasonXV, Resident Webmaster, and Slaveboy will be his official title with the new business structure.
F you to work.
Constant F you to work.
I don't like all the workload being pushed off on me.
Right Shannon Joyce says, Joyce says F you to the world.
and EvilNauki2DX would like to say one quick FU for Ragnarok Online.
Taking my life away.
Korean knockoff.
It's Ragnarok!
Korean life-sucking game, right?
Yeah, Ragnarok's another one of those life-sucking MMORPGs that you play and you start going, how did I ever get into this in the first place?
I did like Ragnarok though, it was so cute I will play Ragnarok 2 probably and people that know me know that I don't really have a whole lot of time for those other MMORPGs but I will give Ragnarok Online 2 a chance
It was adorable.
It's cute.
I'm sorry, I still had that picture for the longest time on my phone of your mage and my assassin.
Seriously, where else could me, a guy, get a character with red spiky hair like I have in real life sometimes and then get a big purple bow to wear in my hair?
That bow gave you plus one intelligence.
What other MMORPG will let me wear a big purple feminine bow in my hair?
And I never did get one of the huge ass ribbons, though.
That's what made me sad.
You know, I had almost got you one until you said that you quit.
I might have come back just for the big ribbon.
Wasn't there a cake song about that?
I don't... a ribbon?
Pretty Pink Ribbon or something like that?
Something like that, I don't know.
All right, we're going to go to another break here.
And when we come back, we're going to head on over to DDR Freak and check out our DDR Chit Chat Post of the Week.
And we're going to chit chat about it a little bit here in studio as well.
So we're going to do that when we come back.
After this break, featuring some more music from 2DX Red.
And we're going to start it off with a song that you actually saw in 8th style as well, if you picked up the home version.
But it's a good song.
It really is a good song, and it's worth playing again.
It's Spiral Galaxy.
Enjoy, guys.
We'll be back with more Orange Launch Radio.
Thanks for watching!
Thanks for watching!
Thanks for watching!
Thanks for watching!
Thanks for watching!
Thanks for watching!
Thanks for watching!
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Thanks for watching!
And now, let's listen in to an Orange Lounge Radio staff meeting as they debate some of the new programming coming to Orange Lounge Radio.
Jamie, I have a suggestion about some of the music in our Bomani Music and More program.
Can we talk about that?
No subject will ever be taboo.
Well, I was thinking maybe we should move Pump Up the Volume from Tuesday Nights.
Except, of course, a subject that was just under discussion.
Okay, well, what would you think if maybe we cut back on some of the tack music we play on the station?
I collect your fucking head.
Just like this fucker here.
Oh my god, why did you do that to Loki?
The holic thing on episode 69 was just a joke!
Now if any of you sons of bitches got anything else to say, now's the fucking time!
Orange Lounge Radio, where everybody has a say.
You know what else needs to happen when the station changes later this month?
New promos.
I'm thinking it's about time.
I love that promo.
Don't get me wrong.
But damn, we need some new ones.
Seriously.
How long have we been using the Captain Jack crying one?
Seriously.
Since episode six, baby.
I like the one that you made based on Dan's old joke.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
We don't care.
So we're going to have an unofficial contest.
And the prize, if you win the contest, is you get your promo plate on the air.
What?
We will send you autographed the EX-2 and the MAX-2, whatever the work.
The Ultramix 2 and the Extreme V-Rares?
Yes.
I will send you autographed copies.
Alright, we will pick our favorites and we will send them autographed copies of the V-Rares.
By us.
By us.
And whoever else we can dig up.
Maybe we can get some DDR Freak friends to sign them too.
Granted, it's not as good as the Make Edit Get Porn contest, but it will have to do.
Thank you for watching!
We did have a winner, and the winner at the time was Dave.
Those of you who have been listening to the show forever might remember Dave, how he used to come on and listen in the studio with us.
How he used to race me home.
Him and Paul, but they do not, for some reason, come over anymore.
We're not cool anymore.
We're not cool anymore.
They're probably out screwing girls now, basically.
They discovered girls.
Puberty hit or something?
But anyways, so, he won one of the prizes and I ended up giving him literally a 50 box of porn.
And we're talking like, this isn't no small box of porn, this was a giant box of porn.
And he earned every bit of it too.
DDR Chit Chat Post of the Week
That's right, when we get bored on this show and we're desperate for materials, we turn to our buddies over on DDR Freak to provide us with the inspiration we need to keep this show going.
And we pick a post from DDR Chit Chat and make it our Post of the Week.
Now, it was very tempting to use this as the Post of the Week, which actually was suggested to us by Flairone, which had the subject, Does this girl worth risking?
Hi, several months ago I have signed erotic teen site.
I have asked owner of this site and he gave me mail one of the models.
Her name is Julia and here her free page.
How do you think it is possible to have long relation with such models?
Is it safe to go Ukraine now for meeting?
That sounds amazingly like the Henry Rollins bit about the guy from Hungary.
You know, the problem I have with that post, besides the fact it doesn't make any fucking sense, is that we have to have a little bit of a discussion on the post of the week.
So, that does not work for the post of the week.
I apologize.
Now, this was actually, I can't fault this post for wording or grammar or anything.
It's actually a pretty interesting post.
I gotta ask the folks in chat, or the folks not only in chat, but the folks in studio what they think about this one.
This is a post and it's titled, Middle Finger Usage We've all seen people make use of their middle finger in pictures of their DDR accomplishments What's the significance of this?
Does it symbolize hate for the song?
Does it mean the accomplishment was hard to do?
Are they full of rage and don't know where to let it out?
Is it the end thing to do?
If so, why did it become this way?
Do they want to look like rebels, and are they succeeding?
Are they conformists who don't even know the significance?
I suspect a combination of the last three, but I don't really know.
It's telling the song, I fucked your mom, and that's it.
That's what it is.
More or less, you know, it's like, ha, I fucked your mom, and I triple-A'd you.
The end.
Is that where the expression, I triple-A'd your mom, comes from?
Because I've heard that.
I've read that expression a lot on some of the message boards.
And I always read that and go, God, you're 14.
To be honest, I'm just totally guessing.
I have no fucking clue why.
I think it's because kids are stupid.
I mean, because maybe flashing your penis is illegal.
So, you know, flipping off the camera is like, look at me, I'm hardcore and I'm rebellious.
I don't know.
Jamie, are there any pictures of you on the internet giving the middle finger on a DDR machine?
There have been, actually.
Why?
Why were you giving the finger?
I think I was pissed off at the song.
It's just a song.
What did the song do to you?
Fuck your mother.
Did the song triple A your mom?
Back in the day, possibly, but not currently.
Her husband would take exception to that.
Bugged, now you've given the middle finger to several DDR machines, right?
Sure, why not?
I can go do that right now.
But are you just giving the middle finger to the DDR machine because you're like fucking losers or what?
No, it's because I can't get my zipper down at the same time.
You're supposed to laugh, damn it.
Here's a quote from the chat room.
Wow, that's a really good question.
And Illusion says, I'm only going to say this because I know Illusion happens to live in this same area, so I guess he's including himself.
Illusion says, all those SoCal people always flip off the camera.
They look like such dipshits.
I don't know.
I don't know why.
I mean, I flip off the camera sometimes.
I flip off the webcam all the time.
I have a picture of me flipping off people wearing a cast.
And then I had the cast cut off with hedge cutters.
That was one of the few pictures that you posted on Orange Sounds Radio, wasn't it?
You know, when I flip you guys off on the webcam... It's a symbol of love.
It is.
It's a symbol of love.
We really fucking love you.
Well, what does the word fuck really mean, though?
It means, I want to make love to you.
So when I flip you guys off on the webcam, I'm saying, I want to make love to you.
And when they flip you off when they're playing DDR, they're really saying, I want to make sweet, sweet love to that song I just played.
That's not the way I always understand it, especially when there's a lot of cursing that doesn't go with the love, you know, the God damn, doesn't really match.
I've triplied that song and I'd like to make sweet, sweet love to your mom or something, I don't know.
Maybe Loki just does it because he heard Freeze pop over the intercom when the picture was taken.
What now?
Do my best!
I completely missed that.
Yes, yes you did.
It's funny.
I'm sure it wasn't, but that's okay.
And we have a question from the chatroom.
Flairone says, you want to make love to me, Sky?
In reality, yes, I want to make love to all of you.
And there's a good reason for that, because you guys are what have made this station so damn great.
And for that, I want to make love to all of you.
For those of you guys that are in the chatroom and support this show, DDR Angel's running away right now.
Why are you doing that?
I didn't mean now, you know, just someday.
Okay.
In the metaphorical sense.
That doesn't mean I actually want to take your club.
In the metaphorical sense.
You get what I'm saying?
Jamie, don't you want to make love to all our listeners in the metaphorical sense?
Hell no!
Do you know where some of those people have been?
Some have been with your mother!
Do we have any hot Asian big-breasted chicks listening?
I am.
Otherwise, you know.
I am, and you can't prove that I'm not.
Yeah, I think I can, but anyways, um, cause I know it's mostly ad-listing guys, and I'm not into that, so, we need to be hitting up our big-breasted Asian demographic, goddammit, cause this is what we're, like, really hurting on, is the big-breasted female Asian demographic, you know, age range of, you know, 21 to 28.
Well, maybe you need to think of a show that would cater to the big-breasted Asian women.
Think about this one.
Big Booby Chicks.
That'd be a BBC show.
Well, I could think of a couple ideas for a show.
However, they would be very inappropriate for the radio.
Like this isn't?
Well, I'm trying to back away from making excessive amounts of racial stereotypes.
Other people have an idea.
Ask G4 how they did it.
Now, Rychan and Joyce are sitting there in the chat room.
And they're saying, I've got the hot, hot Asian over here.
And now they're claiming that there's no... They said, if you don't require big breasts.
But I'm thinking the breasts are just fine.
I'm thinking that they're just being a little self-deprecating.
That's two women over there listening.
Hey, that's two out of, you know, whatever.
That's a good percentage.
It's more than one.
Yes, DarkSakura.
I'm not commenting.
Wise.
Very wise.
If we have the big boobied Asian women show, we can certainly have the pantsless rage show.
That's fine.
The what?
Old joke.
You need to, Loki, you seriously need to register a site, just bigbreastedasianchicksonddr.com Quick, hold his credit card.
Maybe, maybe our webmaster can help us make that happen.
You know, it's only like, what, nine dollars or something to register a domain name.
It's really fucking cheap.
I'll just have it point to, you know, Loki Fusion, so.
Anyway, now Rychan and Joyce are arguing about their boobies.
I don't know, maybe we'll get them on the skyline another week.
Sorry guys, but we do have to bring this show to a close.
Yes, Loki?
I mean, not saying that I'm hating against the Asians with smaller breasts.
I mean, that's all good.
I mean, you can't hate on it.
Like they say, any more than a handful is a waste.
So, or was that a mouthful?
I can't remember.
I think it was a mouthful, yes.
and we're getting a post to our website here.
It says www.bigbreastedasians.com I'm sure that site already exists, people.
I'm sure it does.
Here's the catch, though.
Big Breasted Asians playing DDR is the catch.
Oh, it doesn't?
Bigbreastedasians.com doesn't exist?
Wow.
Wow.
We need to register big-breasted Asians and have it point to Orange Lounge Radio.
Big-breasted Asian women playing DDR.com certainly doesn't have a thing.
Alright.
Alright.
Loki's going to work on that.
I can't believe big-breasted Asians isn't registered.
Somebody can get us that for Christmas and have it point to Orange Lounge Radio.
Seriously, I will point that to Orange Lounge Radio if I can do that.
I will seriously... Wait, it's like only a few bucks.
I mean, I could do that.
That'd be funny.
Oh, actually, Jason says BigBreastedAsians.com does exist.
He checked.
I just checked and it wasn't there.
It may be registered.
It may be registered with no website.
That's probably it then.
Alright, I would have a hard time believing that BigBreastedAsians.com wouldn't exist.
Now maybe there could be like BigTittiedAsians or BigJuggedAsians or well, you know what, we really need to end this show at this point, I'm thinking.
In order to do that, we have to go around and get everybody's final thought.
Bud, your final thought.
Puppy Bowl.
And TDR Angel, your final thought.
Um, I don't have one, sorry.
DarkSakura... Actually, Loki, your final thought.
I hope that battery doesn't explode when I'm done charging it and plug it into the monitor.
So it's like I've had really bad luck with batteries.
Lick it first.
My final thought is you better take that shit outside when you plug it in the first time in case you start any fires.
DarkSakura, your final thought.
Japanese games that have intros in German are awesome.
Second thought.
Tonight's final word.
I'm going to give the final word of the show tonight to DDR Angel because she hasn't said shit tonight so she needs to get at least one word in.
And thank you guys very much for listening.
We will see you next week.
Same bat time, same bat channel.
Thanks a lot for tuning in and supporting Orange Lounge Radio.
Don't forget ways you can whore us up is you can vote us a five in your player window.
Vote us five stars and listen to us 24 hours a day, seven days a week.
Just, you know, whore up our ratings.
We appreciate it.
Love you guys.
All right, Angel.
Tonight's final word.
Bye.

Sadness.
What?
What, Angel?
I just whispered the death game and he didn't even say anything.
Because I couldn't hear you.
Well, yeah, it was supposed to be like a seven days type whisper thing.
Jamie, you look like you're about to say something over there.
