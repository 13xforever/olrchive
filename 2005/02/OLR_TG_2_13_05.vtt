00:28.500 --> 00:34.780
Here we are the week of Valentine's Day. I hope you all are having a lovely Valentine's Day. I know I'm not

00:35.940 --> 00:38.200
Because I'm single as hell, but that's alright

00:38.580 --> 00:42.580
Dark Sakura is actually out tonight because she's spending the holiday with her fiance

00:42.580 --> 00:48.220
So we have some guests filling in tonight. Say hello to DDR angel. Hello. Hi DDR angel. Welcome to our podcast

00:49.060 --> 00:55.940
Glad to be here. We also have bugged here tonight. Hola. Hello bugged. How are you? Very quiet. Unfortunately, that's alright

00:55.940 --> 01:00.260
it happens you're making up for it nice and loud yeah all right so you get it

01:00.260 --> 01:03.500
takes two people to fill in for dark Sakura apparently no we like we like

01:03.500 --> 01:08.140
having guests on the show it rocks Loki's here of course though I am and

01:08.140 --> 01:13.180
he's all excited about that orange box PC he just finished up explain really

01:13.180 --> 01:15.980
briefly for our podcast listeners I know you went into it in detail on the three

01:15.980 --> 01:21.580
hour show this week but what is it that you did here I put a PC a micro ITX PC

01:21.580 --> 01:27.580
Which is a, it's a form factor. It's 15 centimeters by 15 centimeters. It's the size of the motherboard.

01:27.580 --> 01:33.580
And, um, it's inside of an Xbox that's painted orange. Hence the orange box.

01:34.580 --> 01:38.580
Now, if Bill Gates finds out about this, do you think you're going to be in any trouble, or?

01:39.580 --> 01:44.580
The only trouble I'd be in is because I have a pirated version of Windows in it, but that's about it.

01:44.580 --> 01:47.580
Oh, that and the movies that might be on the hard drive.

01:47.580 --> 01:50.580
It's not RIAA or MPAA friendly.

01:50.580 --> 01:54.580
You do know anyone can download this podcast, right?

01:54.580 --> 01:58.580
Whatever, I don't care. I'll put Linux on it!

01:58.580 --> 02:02.580
Don't make me put Linux on it! God damn it, I will.

02:02.580 --> 02:06.580
Free BSD all the way.

02:06.580 --> 02:10.580
You took a little PS1 monitor, they don't really sell

02:10.580 --> 02:14.580
so many of those anymore because they don't sell the PS1 so much, but you actually took one of those portable 5 inch monitors.

02:14.580 --> 02:18.580
How the hell are you able to see anything on this thing?

02:18.580 --> 02:23.980
enlarged all the fonts on it to very large and you know I also have thank God

02:23.980 --> 02:27.700
for Windows and having that you know feature the magnifier for those people

02:27.700 --> 02:33.140
that can't see shit you load that up there and anything that you you know

02:33.140 --> 02:37.660
move over with your mouse it will enlarge in the slow window for you so

02:37.660 --> 02:44.300
I've used that a lot and but it be to be honest actually you can see quite a bit

02:44.300 --> 02:48.140
on that monitor because it's such a high resolution small text is the only

02:48.140 --> 02:52.220
problem I noticed it's very crisp so if you do plan to use it for movies and

02:52.220 --> 02:56.300
your games or something it's gonna be very crisp kind of hard to see but

02:56.300 --> 03:00.540
interesting all right um I thought we go around and before we get into this

03:00.540 --> 03:03.420
week's gaming news this we do have some guests on the panel tonight I thought we

03:03.420 --> 03:05.700
could talk about what kind of games you've been playing this week what kind

03:05.700 --> 03:13.780
of stuff have you been into Angel the MXO beta test which was yeah and for

03:13.780 --> 03:17.900
those not in the know in the acronym know that was matrix online right

03:17.900 --> 03:24.900
I noticed that people are selling, because you had to have a code to get into the Matrix

03:24.900 --> 03:25.900
online beta test, right?

03:25.900 --> 03:28.820
I noticed people are selling those codes on eBay.

03:28.820 --> 03:30.780
My first question is, A, is that legal?

03:30.780 --> 03:31.780
Probably not.

03:31.780 --> 03:32.780
But B, is it worth it?

03:32.780 --> 03:33.780
I don't know.

03:33.780 --> 03:35.660
You can get it at five bucks for fries.

03:35.660 --> 03:37.220
I mean, at fries.

03:37.220 --> 03:38.220
Okay.

03:38.220 --> 03:41.060
Go to fries and get it for five bucks.

03:41.060 --> 03:44.820
So and you're doing like a pre-order then, and then you get to play the game on beta

03:44.820 --> 03:45.820
test as well.

03:45.820 --> 03:46.820
Yeah.

03:46.820 --> 03:47.820
That's cool.

03:47.820 --> 03:56.060
Right? A little bit. I'm only level two. And I played it maybe about an hour, an hour at the most on this.

03:56.640 --> 04:04.420
It looks pretty. It's a little, a little difficult to get into it. Because it's just like they kind of

04:05.580 --> 04:10.660
throw you into it with not really giving you any direction. The only real thing you have is missions that you take.

04:10.660 --> 04:16.660
And the missions don't really progress the story along that much. I've actually lost track of what the hell the story is.

04:16.660 --> 04:24.660
And the graphics, I like it. It looks really cool. It looks like you're playing an online game set in like almost like a Grand Theft Auto type environment.

04:24.660 --> 04:28.660
But you can go into all the buildings and you can run around the rooms and everything.

04:28.660 --> 04:34.660
So that's kind of cool. But it's real easy to like lose track of what's going on and that.

04:34.660 --> 04:40.660
And I couldn't tell, you know, the NPC characters from the player characters and whatnot. I have no idea what the hell I'm doing in it.

04:40.660 --> 04:50.660
So, for people that may not have gotten into online gaming, but like the Matrix franchise, and they try to play this, they're going to be probably turned off by it, I think.

04:50.660 --> 04:53.660
Alright, what else have you been playing this week, Angel?

04:53.660 --> 05:08.660
Actually, I watched someone play World of Warcraft, so I'm kind of getting, I don't know, I kind of wanted, but I kind of don't, because, you know, I don't want to be, you know, whooping on Final Fantasy XI too much, because I do like that one a lot more, so.

05:08.660 --> 05:12.940
I know it's it's tough. I as much as I love fantasy 11

05:12.940 --> 05:16.540
I everybody is raving about World of Warcraft and the time I saw it

05:16.540 --> 05:19.620
I was kind of like because I watched somebody play it too and I was kind of like

05:19.620 --> 05:22.940
Yeah, but I kind of feel like I owe it to myself now with everybody just

05:23.740 --> 05:26.220
Gushing over this game that I need to really sit down and play it

05:26.220 --> 05:29.840
but again, I said this on the three hour show that we do at orange was ready calm, but

05:30.660 --> 05:35.860
The the number one thing I hear why people like this game is because it's easier to play by yourself

05:35.860 --> 05:40.220
which to me kind of defeats the purpose of the massively multiplayer concept in

05:40.220 --> 05:44.340
the first place but to each their own whatever that's what you like with our

05:44.340 --> 05:49.660
copy of World of Warcraft we actually got a 10-day trial thing like you could

05:49.660 --> 05:53.700
actually give the code to somebody else and try it for 10 days so you know it's

05:53.700 --> 05:58.480
open to me I can I can do it but I don't know you know we'll see interesting if

05:58.480 --> 06:01.700
you do end up doing it I want your 10-day card that you get because I want

06:01.700 --> 06:08.180
check it out a little more in depth. Oh, you mean if I buy my own copies? Yeah, yeah. Oh yeah, no problem. Cool!

06:08.180 --> 06:11.920
I've also been playing a lot of there this week now, for those that don't know.

06:11.920 --> 06:13.440
It's, it's like uh...

06:13.440 --> 06:14.740
TSO, but better.

06:14.740 --> 06:21.540
And uh... Well, you're playing the acronyms game again. The Sims Online, right? Oh, sorry, Sims Online. That's alright, that's alright.

06:21.540 --> 06:22.420
Alright.

06:22.420 --> 06:29.420
Um... It's chat about TSO and uh... MXO on OLR. Yeah, see? There you go. Acronym game.

06:29.420 --> 06:30.980
Alright, that's fine.

06:30.980 --> 06:33.720
for those who want more information on there

06:33.720 --> 06:36.300
uh... open up your internet explorer i mean uh...

06:36.300 --> 06:41.160
explorer or uh... firefox if you're smarter actually you can't because it's

06:41.160 --> 06:44.060
like picky about that it won't let you do it

06:44.060 --> 06:48.560
i know sucks lame whatever it's probably don't want to play it

06:48.560 --> 06:52.100
it's like an XML thing or something something anyway uh... yeah so just go to

06:52.100 --> 06:53.520
there dot com

06:53.520 --> 06:56.940
you know find out for yourself if you really like it or not

06:56.940 --> 07:00.020
Fair enough. So it's kind of like The Sims Online, but without all the prostitution.

07:00.020 --> 07:01.020
Okay.

07:01.020 --> 07:02.020
Whatever.

07:02.020 --> 07:08.460
Well, fun in that. Seriously, that's the only reason why I play The Sims Online.

07:08.460 --> 07:12.240
That's what I heard The Sims Online turned into, is it was like Vegas and I don't know

07:12.240 --> 07:14.020
if this is true, but I was reading articles on this.

07:14.020 --> 07:15.020
I don't play it anymore.

07:15.020 --> 07:22.160
Sims Online turned into this big gambling, crack dealing site. I don't, crazy. I just

07:22.160 --> 07:26.420
know that The Sims Online was not quite as popular as I think they'd hoped it would be,

07:26.420 --> 07:28.620
considering the popularity of The Sims.

07:28.620 --> 07:32.960
I also got to see Minish Cap this week, that was pretty cool.

07:32.960 --> 07:36.560
By the way, speaking of The Sims, I want to get this out real quick, The Sims celebrated

07:36.560 --> 07:41.480
its 5th anniversary this week, and guess, get this, The Sims has shipped since its release

07:41.480 --> 07:47.300
52 million units and been translated into 17 different languages.

07:47.300 --> 07:52.540
The series of games has been a top seller for 4 of the past 5 years.

07:52.540 --> 07:53.540
Crazy huh?

07:53.540 --> 07:54.660
Wow, yay for that.

07:54.660 --> 08:00.980
I remember the first time I played The Sims, I had to kill people.

08:00.980 --> 08:02.900
I don't know about the rest of you.

08:02.900 --> 08:04.540
I know this is true with you, Loki.

08:04.540 --> 08:08.180
When you did your review of The Sims 2, you were like, how many interesting ways could

08:08.180 --> 08:10.020
I kill people in this game?

08:10.020 --> 08:14.700
Exactly, and I have to really go back to that and find some more ways to do that, because

08:14.700 --> 08:18.940
my elaborate death house didn't turn out as fun as I thought it would be.

08:18.940 --> 08:21.820
You end up with piles of stuff?

08:21.820 --> 08:28.640
No, people just didn't want to die that quickly, like I kept, because I was putting in the

08:28.640 --> 08:33.120
cheat codes where you can move any object around, so I was picking up people there walking

08:33.120 --> 08:38.740
by the house and throwing them up into a room that was enclosed.

08:38.740 --> 08:41.980
They didn't like that too much and they were panicking, it was fun.

08:41.980 --> 08:48.000
I was trying my best to catch a guy on fire, but that really didn't happen.

08:48.000 --> 08:51.800
I remember how you put the giant diving board on the roof and you were going to wait for

08:51.800 --> 08:54.900
somebody to dive and then you were going to take away the pool while they were in the

08:54.900 --> 09:01.680
mid-air, but nobody would ever jump off the board, because they were all so sad.

09:01.680 --> 09:07.880
They also didn't want to jump to their death. I thought that would be a way to do it, but

09:07.880 --> 09:15.280
no one wanted to commit suicide. They really need to release a patch where it's less friendly,

09:15.280 --> 09:19.520
just kind of let people die. Oh, of course I had the nude patch so people would be walking

09:19.520 --> 09:24.160
and naked all the time too. The Sims Morbid Edition. Only on the internet. Anything else

09:24.160 --> 09:28.800
you've been playing Angel? Not that I can think of at the moment. Alright, fair enough.

09:28.800 --> 09:34.880
Bud, what have you been playing this week? Maps.google.com. Now that is a very cool site.

09:34.880 --> 09:39.760
I checked this out. Very cool. Like just, sometimes it's fun to just play with those

09:39.760 --> 09:45.960
Atlas programs and like, oh here's my house and here's you know, but it's, what they don't

09:45.960 --> 09:49.700
have, which I think is really cool, and I think MapQuest has this, but it has like the

09:49.700 --> 09:53.740
satellite view version. Or does Google have that now? I don't know.

09:53.740 --> 10:01.240
They have something similar. This is actually an article on Hackaday.com. They had a website

10:01.240 --> 10:07.960
that had both Google's map feature and this other map feature where you can actually plug

10:07.960 --> 10:19.960
I don't know, it was like coordinates actually, and you can view the Google map and then also the actual satellite picture.

10:19.960 --> 10:20.960
That was the London one, right?

10:20.960 --> 10:24.960
I don't remember, but anyways.

10:24.960 --> 10:29.960
Alright, he's gonna look that one up. So you've been playing with that though? Oh, yes?

10:29.960 --> 10:33.520
yet again another Linux

10:33.520 --> 10:37.640
they stuck Linux in a Billy Bass

10:37.640 --> 10:42.080
the singing fish

10:42.080 --> 10:45.080
the singing fish things

10:45.080 --> 10:49.800
why people why? a follow up to last week when we were talking about they won't install Linux in

10:49.800 --> 10:50.460
anything

10:50.460 --> 10:55.280
there you go they've installed Linux in a Billy Bass. My pants are still Linux free

10:55.280 --> 11:00.820
for now anything else you've been playing with other than the maps game

11:00.820 --> 11:06.320
I've been playing the real-world game of employment I haven't had time to play a

11:06.320 --> 11:09.120
damn game this week all right well you're a lot of fun to have on this show

11:09.120 --> 11:14.720
then yeah it's all right make it a halo 2 oh I don't like my Mac I watched my

11:14.720 --> 11:20.160
Mac sleep all week I haven't played halo in a long time it's kind of sad

11:20.160 --> 11:24.800
anyway um what I've been playing this week I've been playing I actually

11:24.800 --> 11:28.400
decided I well I play mr. driller a little more because angel let me borrow

11:28.400 --> 11:32.580
mr. driller and I actually remember how last week I said I needed to get good at

11:32.580 --> 11:36.720
the game and figure out the strategies I think I'm getting okay I'm finally

11:36.720 --> 11:39.880
learning how to get some of those tricky air capsules without having to dig

11:39.880 --> 11:42.800
straight down all the time and I'm getting the concept all it took was a

11:42.800 --> 11:49.240
little time and I figured it out also I decided to go a little retro let this

11:49.240 --> 11:53.560
week because you might remember that dark Sakura she brought with her to the

11:53.560 --> 12:00.360
three hour show last week, she brought Dracula X, but the Japanese version on the Turbo Duo,

12:00.360 --> 12:04.000
okay? And we were watching little clips from that. Well, I remembered somebody said that

12:04.000 --> 12:08.560
there was a Super Nintendo version of that game that came out, and I played it, and it's

12:08.560 --> 12:13.880
awful compared to the one that she brought last week on the Turbo Duo. It is just dreadful,

12:13.880 --> 12:17.600
and I remember I had played that game a long time ago when it first came out, and I was

12:17.600 --> 12:22.100
like, what happened to the Castlevania games? They used to be so cool. So I decided instead

12:22.100 --> 12:27.020
to go back and play Super Castlevania IV, because that game is awesome, and it's a great

12:27.020 --> 12:31.580
Castlevania game. So I was feeling a little retro this week. You had a comment, Angel?

12:31.580 --> 12:34.500
I was gonna say, I didn't even know you had a Super Nintendo.

12:34.500 --> 12:35.900
Oh yes you did.

12:35.900 --> 12:39.420
I have one on my PC. Get it?

12:39.420 --> 12:40.900
Oh yeah, whatever.

12:40.900 --> 12:46.100
Heh heh, heh heh, heh heh. Alright. Loki, what kind of games have you been playing this

12:46.100 --> 12:47.100
week?

12:47.100 --> 12:52.100
Um, just, I played the Matrix online in Final Fantasy 11.

12:52.100 --> 12:58.860
I haven't even gotten back to Grand Theft Auto San Andreas yet.

12:58.860 --> 13:03.820
I really need to go back to that, it'll be fun.

13:03.820 --> 13:07.460
No other game I'm going to be playing soon, which comes out tomorrow.

13:07.460 --> 13:11.080
Yep, WarioWare Touched.

13:11.080 --> 13:12.900
That's going to be the next game.

13:12.900 --> 13:16.580
I'm very excited about WarioWare Touched, and I think it's great that they're releasing

13:16.580 --> 13:19.900
it on Valentine's Day for those that are downloading the podcast throughout the week. He's talking

13:19.900 --> 13:23.580
about Valentine's Day. Now does it ship? This is one thing that always confused the hell

13:23.580 --> 13:28.180
out of me. Is it shipping tomorrow or is it shelving tomorrow? Because you know that they

13:28.180 --> 13:31.900
have a ship day and then usually the shelf date is one or two days afterwards. Is it

13:31.900 --> 13:37.140
shipping or shelving tomorrow? That's what I want to know.

13:37.140 --> 13:43.220
Well I don't know. I have only been going by IGN site which has the release date for

13:43.220 --> 13:48.940
tomorrow so whatever that means probably the ship so I'm not gonna go to the store

13:48.940 --> 13:52.260
till Tuesday but I'm very excited nonetheless to be playing this game I'm

13:52.260 --> 13:54.540
very excited we'll bring you a full review of that next week because you

13:54.540 --> 13:57.480
know we're all gonna be playing that you you you like the WarioWare games too

13:57.480 --> 14:05.340
right angel yes I do there might be a GameStop trip in the near future is it

14:05.340 --> 14:10.020
supposed to have multiplayer in this one I don't remember I hope they took some

14:10.020 --> 14:13.200
of the good ideas from the GameCube one because the GameCube WarioWare was like

14:13.200 --> 14:17.760
eh, you know, because it was basically the same darn game, but it had such a cool like

14:17.760 --> 14:18.760
multiplayer edition.

14:18.760 --> 14:19.760
But multiplayer is so much fun!

14:19.760 --> 14:22.040
It is so much fun!

14:22.040 --> 14:23.040
Only one player.

14:23.040 --> 14:24.040
Doh!

14:24.040 --> 14:25.040
Doh!

14:25.040 --> 14:28.900
Classic Nintendo, they'll do the multiplayer in the next release, and it'll be the same

14:28.900 --> 14:32.800
damn game, but multiplayer, oh well, gotta love them.

14:32.800 --> 14:37.040
Alright, let's talk about some news this week, we'll start it, we'll actually start it off

14:37.040 --> 14:38.040
with Nintendo.

14:38.040 --> 14:42.240
I have quite a little bit of Nintendo news to talk about right now.

14:42.240 --> 14:50.140
This is interesting, EBgames.com is listing a Metroid pinball game for the DS.

14:50.140 --> 14:55.040
Very interesting, I don't know, they're listing it on their game as tentative December 5th.

14:55.040 --> 15:00.680
Nintendo of America will not comment on this, but if you think about it, in the game, in

15:00.680 --> 15:05.160
Metroid the game, Samus does condense into the little ball, it's one of the first things

15:05.160 --> 15:10.080
she gets, so I don't know, this would be kind of a fit.

15:10.080 --> 15:13.600
Why did that suddenly bring me back to, like, Sonic Spinball?

15:13.600 --> 15:15.880
That's the first thing I thought of, too, was Sonic Spinball.

15:15.880 --> 15:19.240
Because it had, like, that same look in the sewer stage in the beginning.

15:19.240 --> 15:20.240
I don't know.

15:20.240 --> 15:21.240
Bug?

15:21.240 --> 15:22.240
Same thing.

15:22.240 --> 15:23.240
Same thing.

15:23.240 --> 15:24.580
Sonic Spinball and Pokemon.

15:24.580 --> 15:28.600
I guess the Pokemon Pinball games do pretty well, so why not, since we haven't had a new

15:28.600 --> 15:31.080
Pokemon game in a while, why not go into another series?

15:31.080 --> 15:34.000
And then Mario had a pinball game as well.

15:34.000 --> 15:35.000
What?

15:35.000 --> 15:37.400
Yeah, Mario had a pinball game too long ago on the Advance.

15:37.400 --> 15:38.400
Logie?

15:38.400 --> 15:45.780
I don't know why why with pinball games I mean why I guess it would work though

15:45.780 --> 15:48.860
with the two shoulder buttons that'd be kind of neat but where's the taller the

15:48.860 --> 15:55.180
screens tall yeah I I don't know I could see as more as like a little mini game

15:55.180 --> 16:00.220
that they might include with like you know the Metroid Prime Hunters or

16:00.220 --> 16:06.840
something like that interesting to see coming out soon or actually I should say

16:06.840 --> 16:11.640
just was released not too long ago. Judge Dredd, Dredd vs Death? Why are they releasing

16:11.640 --> 16:20.880
Judge Dredd games? Honestly, I am the law. Couldn't tell you that one. Also in the news

16:20.880 --> 16:25.400
about Nintendo, this story is coming out of the Japanese Trademark and Patent Office,

16:25.400 --> 16:29.020
or at least that's the place that inspired this story. Nintendo has registered a couple

16:29.020 --> 16:35.280
trademarks recently, one of them being the Nintendo V-Pocket. Now, you don't know what

16:35.280 --> 16:40.200
that means but it also has a little logo that goes with it and the rumors saying

16:40.200 --> 16:46.560
that maybe it's some type of DS adapter who knows could it be that rumored mpeg

16:46.560 --> 16:54.480
for an mp3 adapter don't know who knows it is it is that adapter v-pocket video

16:54.480 --> 16:58.520
pocket hello come on it doesn't take a genius to figure this one out I mean

16:58.520 --> 17:02.280
that's what it is it's what's gonna be it because everyone what everyone loves

17:02.280 --> 17:08.600
and is eating up portable video. And now that the PSP is going to have the UMD format, of

17:08.600 --> 17:13.000
course they're going to need to come up with their own format for, you know, to be used

17:13.000 --> 17:18.720
with the DS or to be used with, you know, the GBA. So, of course, that's what it is.

17:18.720 --> 17:24.840
Alright, we'll see if you're right. Speaking of the games coming out for PSP, or I should

17:24.840 --> 17:30.200
say the movies, there's actually going to be some movies released on UMD format on April

17:30.200 --> 17:35.980
19th here in America and we're gonna have films xxx xxx or you want to call

17:35.980 --> 17:40.640
it you know that Vin Diesel movie hellboy resident evil apocalypse and

17:40.640 --> 17:45.160
once upon a time in Mexico they're gonna be released on that UMD format

17:45.160 --> 17:50.600
specifically for your PSP so you can watch movies on the go sound interesting

17:50.600 --> 17:56.680
to anybody is this something you'd be interested in no it's interesting like

17:56.680 --> 18:02.680
perspective of me because I work at a video distribution company so it's yet

18:02.680 --> 18:11.440
another format that won't take off just like the DVHS so nice try we'll see how

18:11.440 --> 18:14.640
long it goes but I don't think people are gonna be buying their copies know

18:14.640 --> 18:17.200
what's gonna happen they're gonna find a way to just put this on a flash card

18:17.200 --> 18:25.920
for you know it won't work if you buy one of it this is one of the stories we

18:25.920 --> 18:28.560
about last week if you buy one of the first million units you're gonna get a

18:28.560 --> 18:33.800
copy of spider-man 2 so but as I movies ahoy yeah as I mentioned last week who

18:33.800 --> 18:38.040
doesn't know in that movie already anyway I mean anybody that had a remote

18:38.040 --> 18:41.680
interest in that movie probably has it already I don't know this is my thought

18:41.680 --> 18:46.000
but what I another interesting thing about this format that he is interesting

18:46.000 --> 18:50.280
is that I don't really see this catch it me personally I don't see this catching

18:50.280 --> 18:55.640
on too much because I think there's a very limited genre as to what can be

18:55.640 --> 19:00.120
released on the PSP I don't see them releasing like at Academy Award-winning

19:00.120 --> 19:05.080
foreign films on UMD format I think it's gonna be mostly these bang-bang shoot

19:05.080 --> 19:14.080
them up films the the hardware to create the format is not readily available and

19:14.080 --> 19:17.320
therefore it's probably not gonna fly that well it's gonna be like mini disc

19:17.320 --> 19:21.480
it's gonna be an underground thing where you know there's gonna be some people

19:21.480 --> 19:25.200
that have it and a lot of people that don't even know what the fuck it is you

19:25.200 --> 19:28.560
You know, and it seems to me that if you want to watch movies on the go, they already have

19:28.560 --> 19:30.160
portable DVD players, and they're pretty...

19:30.160 --> 19:31.160
They don't have a proprietary format.

19:31.160 --> 19:33.200
Yeah, and they're relatively easy to use.

19:33.200 --> 19:37.240
My mother, of all people, has a portable DVD player, and she knows how to use it.

19:37.240 --> 19:41.080
But I could never imagine, you know, if she didn't have one, hypothetically, I could not

19:41.080 --> 19:45.520
imagine buying her a PSP so she could watch movies on the go.

19:45.520 --> 19:48.600
So I just think that the amount of movies they're going to be able to release on this

19:48.600 --> 19:49.960
is going to be pretty limited.

19:49.960 --> 19:50.960
I don't know.

19:50.960 --> 19:52.960
I don't think this is going to catch on, but eh, I could be wrong.

19:52.960 --> 19:58.120
have to do you want to buy your movies in yeah and then just DVD here's where I

19:58.120 --> 20:01.840
think Nintendo actually might be more successful in this well this is the

20:01.840 --> 20:04.620
interesting part if they do decide to release their thing because if you look

20:04.620 --> 20:07.860
at the Game Boy Advance movies that they have out right now like the spongebob

20:07.860 --> 20:12.060
and the strawberry shortcake and all that stuff they have out right the

20:12.060 --> 20:17.960
reason why these are easy for kids is because they're great for car rides you

20:17.960 --> 20:21.820
give the kid the little game and they can sit and watch it while they're on

20:21.820 --> 20:24.940
on the road and on the road a long drive to somewhere.

20:24.940 --> 20:27.220
But I can't imagine giving a kid a PSP

20:27.220 --> 20:29.740
and having him watch Hellboy in the backseat of the car.

20:29.740 --> 20:33.100
You know, I just, I think Nintendo and their bit

20:33.100 --> 20:35.180
of a family friendly quote unquote edge,

20:35.180 --> 20:37.860
although they took a lot of crap for that back in the day,

20:37.860 --> 20:39.940
I think that's gonna help them out in this market.

20:39.940 --> 20:42.100
But that's just my personal thought.

20:42.100 --> 20:44.100
Unless the PSP decides to get competitive

20:44.100 --> 20:46.280
and release some of their own kid friendly stuff,

20:46.280 --> 20:48.420
because I think that's really where this stuff is handy.

20:48.420 --> 20:49.600
But, what do I know?

20:52.380 --> 20:55.260
You know, I'm just waiting and waiting.

20:55.260 --> 20:57.820
I know it's gonna happen, or where they're gonna,

20:57.820 --> 21:00.040
cause this, okay, you've got, you know,

21:00.040 --> 21:04.080
the PSP has got the memory stick port on it, okay?

21:04.940 --> 21:08.300
You can buy, I'm sure they're gonna release something

21:08.300 --> 21:09.880
that's gonna plug into that damn thing

21:09.880 --> 21:13.500
that you're just gonna be able to put some other format

21:13.500 --> 21:16.060
of movie on a flash card in that damn thing.

21:16.060 --> 21:20.260
I don't know I don't see people going out and buying all these UMD

21:20.260 --> 21:23.260
format movies. Why bother?

21:23.260 --> 21:28.020
Why even? Yeah. I wouldn't even rent them. Maybe portable?

21:28.020 --> 21:32.660
No I mean to be honest if you've got your PSP

21:32.660 --> 21:36.020
okay this is just my thought if you got your PSP and you're on a car ride you're going to be playing

21:36.020 --> 21:36.940
fucking games

21:36.940 --> 21:42.120
you're not going to be watching movies. That's why you bought PSP's to play the portable games

21:42.120 --> 21:45.940
not to watch the movies. It is portable PlayStation not portable DVD.

21:45.940 --> 21:51.500
But, nobody thought the Game Boy video thing would catch on for the same reason, yet they're

21:51.500 --> 21:55.380
selling like hotcakes at Walmart.

21:55.380 --> 21:58.660
Because they're cheap, and people will buy anything from Walmart.

21:58.660 --> 22:08.140
Alright, let's move on to another, actually I wanted to say real quick though, there is

22:08.140 --> 22:15.220
another Nintendo trademark that got filed, this one's interesting, it's PCGP.

22:15.220 --> 22:18.680
And the way the logo looks is every letter is in a circle.

22:18.680 --> 22:24.400
No idea what that could be about, but the speculation is, perhaps the P is like Pokemon,

22:24.400 --> 22:27.560
so maybe it's a new peripheral for some type of Pokemon game?

22:27.560 --> 22:28.560
Who knows?

22:28.560 --> 22:33.500
P, G, or I'm sorry, P, C, G, P. Sounds like some new drug.

22:33.500 --> 22:34.500
I don't know.

22:34.500 --> 22:35.500
Logie?

22:35.500 --> 22:41.120
Do you see it after to play?

22:41.120 --> 22:48.000
No, if I was going to guess I would say maybe, I'm probably going to be way off on this,

22:48.000 --> 22:52.400
PC Gaming Portal, in other words it's something for the DS if you have a Wi-Fi adapter or

22:52.400 --> 22:55.680
Bluetooth or whatever to be playing over the internet with someone else.

22:55.680 --> 22:57.720
Or to download more content.

22:57.720 --> 23:00.120
Or something like that.

23:00.120 --> 23:03.400
That guess is very cool, but I think you're wrong.

23:03.400 --> 23:07.480
I don't know, it just seems a little ugly for that, but that's a very cool guess.

23:07.480 --> 23:12.980
Well, it's a guess but they will be announcing something of that sort at e3. So

23:13.540 --> 23:18.920
You know whether this be what it is that will eventually happen. So that's that

23:19.600 --> 23:21.600
Very interesting. All right

23:21.980 --> 23:25.760
One other quick story. I know we don't talk about the end gauge too much on here

23:25.760 --> 23:29.860
And there's a reason for that, but I thought it would be interesting to mention that the x-men legends game

23:30.140 --> 23:33.920
It's done pretty well on the consoles actually and I you know, it's not a bad game

23:33.920 --> 23:37.480
It kind of reminded me of Diablo it was like Diablo x-men was kind of what it was

23:37.520 --> 23:40.420
but it's gonna be coming to the engage which

23:42.560 --> 23:47.320
The engage seems very limited to me and I just don't know how they're gonna pull it off I

23:48.080 --> 23:53.080
But whatever it I mean they might as well put it on the Game Boy Color, but what do you think?

23:55.120 --> 23:59.400
Which is actually very similar to the engage is more useful

23:59.400 --> 24:04.280
little bit of freaking n-gauge because I don't have to talk-o-talk.

24:04.280 --> 24:09.480
But the one cool thing about it, it will feature a wireless multiplayer mode, and that was

24:09.480 --> 24:13.000
one cool thing about X-Men Legends is that it had a multiplayer mode, I mean granted

24:13.000 --> 24:16.440
you had to play for a little bit before you could get multiplayer with it, but it does

24:16.440 --> 24:19.240
have multiplayer mode, so...

24:19.240 --> 24:23.140
I know none of us in here own an n-gauge, but hypothetically, if you did, would there

24:23.140 --> 24:24.600
be an interest in this?

24:24.600 --> 24:25.600
No.

24:25.600 --> 24:29.600
I would have to really question why I owned an N-Gage first.

24:29.600 --> 24:33.600
You'd have to find the other three people in the country that bought the N-Gage.

24:33.600 --> 24:36.600
I mean, really, um...

24:36.600 --> 24:40.600
I had to laugh every time I walked by the N-Gage booth at E3

24:40.600 --> 24:43.600
and all the people trying to get you to go in.

24:43.600 --> 24:46.600
That was my favorite part, because they're like,

24:46.600 --> 24:48.600
COME ON! CHECK IT OUT!

24:48.600 --> 24:51.600
And I go play, I'm like, this is crap.

24:51.600 --> 24:53.600
So, anyways.

24:53.600 --> 24:57.600
All right one more quick story, and then we're gonna wrap it up. I thought this was interesting

24:57.600 --> 25:03.280
I actually read this story was a link that was on slash dot earlier this week specifically their games portion games dot slash dot

25:03.280 --> 25:05.660
Org which is very cool site check it out

25:06.080 --> 25:09.920
If you haven't already if you're a nerd chances are you already you're very familiar with slash dot

25:09.920 --> 25:12.880
But maybe you're not they had a link to this article that talked about

25:13.940 --> 25:15.380
how

25:15.380 --> 25:21.640
Important are review scores in game buying really and I thought I'd kind of pose that same question to us here in the studio

25:21.640 --> 25:25.640
How much do you pay attention to the reviews that a game gets?

25:25.640 --> 25:28.640
Have you ever been influenced to buy a game based on the reviews?

25:28.640 --> 25:33.640
And if not that, what does influence you to buy games, out of curiosity?

25:33.640 --> 25:35.640
I'll start with Loki.

25:35.640 --> 25:40.640
I don't really go by the numbers or whatever, but I'll listen to what they have to say about the game

25:40.640 --> 25:45.640
and consider those factors, you know, since they've played the game.

25:45.640 --> 25:46.640
But a lot of times it really-

25:46.640 --> 25:48.640
That would be a review.

25:48.640 --> 25:55.640
No shit Sherlock. I'm talking about like I'm not going to say okay if he gives it a 10. I'm not going to go out and buy it just because he gives it a 10.

25:55.640 --> 26:03.640
You know I have to look at the reasons why he's giving it a 10. I don't know. It's a good test so I can save my $5 and not rent the thing.

26:03.640 --> 26:13.640
But I don't know. I really most of the time when it comes down to reviews I don't really listen to reviews. It's more buzz that I've heard about the game beforehand.

26:13.640 --> 26:17.800
beforehand that determines whether I buy it or not then of course you know I'll

26:17.800 --> 26:22.720
listen to whether it's crap or not certain games have not done this with

26:22.720 --> 26:31.440
driver 3 and I have learned that lesson so um yeah it helps a little bit but I

26:31.440 --> 26:37.560
don't really you know just go by just reviews angel um pretty much what look

26:37.560 --> 26:42.160
you said just what I do except for the fact that like I'll go to a friend's

26:42.160 --> 26:46.960
or something that already bought it right away and I'll try it there and you know it's pretty much a

26:48.960 --> 26:54.240
visual review pretty much you know you know what I'm trying to say yeah you review by watching

26:54.240 --> 27:01.440
somebody else or trying it myself afterwards and whatever and you know usually probably about 95%

27:01.440 --> 27:06.720
of the time I will end up getting the game that I try because it's just you know I'll find it cool

27:06.720 --> 27:12.440
or whatever, but there is that odd chance where, you know, I don't buy it, and right

27:12.440 --> 27:17.120
now it's being far between, but hey, something might happen down the line, who knows?

27:17.120 --> 27:18.120
Interesting.

27:18.120 --> 27:19.120
Bugged.

27:19.120 --> 27:20.920
I ask my friends.

27:20.920 --> 27:26.180
You know, I feel very similar, is that Buzz does a lot more for me than an actual review,

27:26.180 --> 27:31.640
although I have bought games based on reviews, but not necessarily because it got a glowing

27:31.640 --> 27:34.100
review, because everybody likes different types of games.

27:34.100 --> 27:38.860
For instance, we don't talk a whole lot about sports-based games, although it's a huge market

27:38.860 --> 27:39.860
for gaming.

27:39.860 --> 27:40.860
Or FPSs.

27:40.860 --> 27:44.980
Well, okay, we sometimes talk Halo and Doom a little bit, but for the most part we don't

27:44.980 --> 27:46.280
obsess over those games.

27:46.280 --> 27:51.320
Like the war games, all those war sim games that are first person, you know, there's gazillions

27:51.320 --> 27:52.380
of them.

27:52.380 --> 27:57.220
We don't really talk about a whole lot of those because they just aren't for us.

27:57.220 --> 28:00.680
I'm really generalizing here, I guess maybe I mean for me, but I think what I know of

28:00.680 --> 28:05.200
Loki and Dark Sakura and you guys they're not really our type of game so

28:05.200 --> 28:09.620
maybe one of those games comes out and it gets a great score and perhaps it's a

28:09.620 --> 28:13.760
good game but it's not really just the kind of game I want to play but at the

28:13.760 --> 28:18.040
same time maybe a game comes out and it gets a pretty low score case in point

28:18.040 --> 28:22.820
DDR ultra mix to got a low score from one of those magazines out there but

28:22.820 --> 28:27.020
hurry but I say but I yeah Katamari even got some low scores out there very few

28:27.020 --> 28:32.540
though. It was a pretty critically appreciated game. But it's still, you know, I know I love

28:32.540 --> 28:36.160
that series of games, so I'm going to pick it up anyway. But sometimes there has been

28:36.160 --> 28:41.100
a game based on the review, like maybe they have one on one of the TV networks they're

28:41.100 --> 28:44.920
reviewing a game, and then I look at the game in motion and I go, oh, that looks like kind

28:44.920 --> 28:48.320
of a cool game, I want to pick that up. Like, you remember Under the Skin? We saw that on

28:48.320 --> 28:51.920
a review show. I don't even think they gave it a good review. But we were just like, cool,

28:51.920 --> 28:56.000
you can be an alien and, like, you know, fuck with people. So it looked like a cool game.

28:56.000 --> 28:58.000
I played it all of one time

28:59.720 --> 29:03.600
