maybe it's some sucky news but we'll see uh dark sacra what have you been playing this week what

17
00:01:23,020 --> 00:01:25,740
What have been into I guess I should say what even playing for the past two weeks

18
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:30,540
Wow what a fun game only $49.95

19
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:46,060
Okay, sounds good. We'll go over to Loki. What do you been playing this week? I've been playing my computers broken. What happened

20
00:01:46,060 --> 00:01:48,940
I think the power supply went out

21
00:01:48,940 --> 00:01:55,640
Uh, all I know is the power supply was very fucking hot, and I shut off the compu- well,

22
00:01:55,640 --> 00:02:01,220
I was running through town as my mule in Final Fantasy XI and I was like pew, off.

23
00:02:01,220 --> 00:02:04,760
Did your computer finally just decide to tell you, look buddy, you play too much of this

24
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:06,600
damn game, you need a break?

25
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:10,880
No, it, I think it's the power supply because it's, it was literally really hot.

26
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:15,700
I mean, I, I was touching the case and the case was actually burning my fingers, I mean,

27
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:22,020
That's not usually a good sign if that's happening, and I think the power supply is just shot.

28
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:26,900
Could be all the dust that was in there, it just might have stopped the fan and then the

29
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:29,300
power supply overheated and just died.

30
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:32,280
So I got by a new power supply and that sucks.

31
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:38,220
Before that, I was playing Final Fantasy XI, a little bit of Matrix online, and when I

32
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:42,580
say a little bit of Matrix online, I cannot stress how little I've been playing.

33
00:02:42,580 --> 00:02:49,580
I played through the tutorial again and got bored with it again and then um what else

34
00:02:49,580 --> 00:02:57,580
did I do um I was playing this stupid game that was like it was another freeware game

35
00:02:57,580 --> 00:03:03,860
where you launch gnomes into the air and you like see how far you can get them to fly and

36
00:03:03,860 --> 00:03:09,740
I don't know that was amusing for about five minutes and then uh that's about all I've

37
00:03:09,740 --> 00:03:12,440
have been playing I'm gonna actually start getting into some more console

38
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:16,940
games this week since my computer's down so now heaven forbid yeah you might have

39
00:03:16,940 --> 00:03:20,800
to play some console games this week what are you gonna do well I'm hopefully

40
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:25,000
gonna get my Grand Theft Auto San Andreas back because I want to play that

41
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:33,400
but if not I guess shutter I guess I could start and play through maybe with

42
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:37,720
cheating of course because I can't play these games legitimately Final Fantasy X

43
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:46,800
two oh my gosh 10 all right yes we this was a big issue a while back on the

44
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:51,140
three-hour program that we do over at orange lounge radio.com we actually

45
00:03:51,140 --> 00:03:54,580
wrote squeamix we wrote them an email and said you need to tell us how this is

46
00:03:54,580 --> 00:03:59,320
pronounced is it X 2 or 10 2 because this is a huge argument between Jamie

47
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:05,440
and our chat room and turns out Jamie was right oh it's 10 2 which it's so

48
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:10,400
silly though it's 10-2 but I mean it makes sense at the same time. What can you call this Final Fantasy X-I?

49
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:18,400
Sometimes I call it FFXI for sure. There are too damn many Taro Taro on my screen. Anyway, Jamie

50
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:22,320
are y'all cleaned up all better? Yeah I was playing Final Fantasy 11. This week that's all you've been

51
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:29,480
playing this week? In Silent Hill 3. Oh in Silent Hill 3. And Super Punch-Out. Right on Super Punch-Out. Hey you

52
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:33,280
know what Super Punch-Out if I remember right it kind of came out towards the end of the Super

53
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:38,240
Nintendo it was kind of overlooked it feels like it seems like not a lot of

54
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:41,880
people knew about super punch how everybody knew Mike Tyson's punch out

55
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:47,980
maybe it's just my neck of the woods gratis 3 good choice which is like the

56
00:04:47,980 --> 00:04:54,080
only version I think that with Dan and I could be what what possessed you to get

57
00:04:54,080 --> 00:05:00,000
into Silent Hill 3 as opposed to for other me okay and actually the Xbox

58
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:05,480
wasn't hooked up it's just it's as simple as that sometimes yeah that was

59
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:11,200
it that's for games I've been playing this week WarioWare touched I went out

60
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:15,680
and got Tuesday the day came out I loved the WarioWare original on Game Boy

61
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:21,880
Advance wasn't such a fan of the one on Game Boy or Game Boy GameCube because

62
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:25,840
the problem with it for me is it was just a rehashed version of the same

63
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:29,480
thing I'd already played and not that it was necessarily a bad game per se

64
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:34,640
because the multiplayer stuff was hilarious, but I just got really annoyed that I fell

65
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:40,080
into that Nintendo trap of buying the same thing, just a little bit better, a little

66
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:45,360
newer, so it made me mad and I only played it a couple times. But now, WarioWare Touched

67
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:50,920
is out and it's not a rehashed version, it's got like 180 new games, it's awesome. The

68
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:55,380
only thing that kind of bugged me about it is that I played it so much that I pretty

69
00:05:55,380 --> 00:05:59,300
much unlocked everything after just two days of sitting down with it for a couple hours

70
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:03,940
and playing it so I kind of I've got one thing left to unlock and that's the one

71
00:06:03,940 --> 00:06:07,900
where you've got to go play everything every little game and get the scores it's

72
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:12,540
gonna take me forever but I do love WarioWare and it's just so cool with the

73
00:06:12,540 --> 00:06:16,180
pen it's a little weird because they have microphone games mixed in now and

74
00:06:16,180 --> 00:06:20,580
every microphone game is some type of blowing so it's like draw draw draw draw

75
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:26,060
draw draw it's kind of WarioWare but hey if you like the original WarioWare if

76
00:06:26,060 --> 00:06:30,620
If you like Feel the Magic XXXY, very similar, you'll like WarioWare Touched.

77
00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:32,620
I like the Parrot.

78
00:06:32,620 --> 00:06:34,620
Yeah, the Parrot minigame is very cool.

79
00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:38,700
Because we couldn't get to work at first, but then we finally did, and that was the best.

80
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:41,180
Some of the unlocks are so weird.

81
00:06:41,180 --> 00:06:43,500
Like, the original WarioWare had some awesome unlocks.

82
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:46,220
Like, it had Dr. Wario that you could get in it,

83
00:06:46,220 --> 00:06:53,260
and it had the little game you got with the little bird that would eat the things that fall down from the sky.

84
00:06:53,260 --> 00:06:59,260
WarioWare Touch doesn't have quite the same cool unlocks. Like, you can unlock a calculator.

85
00:06:59,260 --> 00:07:05,260
You can unlock a fortune teller. You can unlock a yo-yo.

86
00:07:05,260 --> 00:07:07,260
What was the gelatin thing?

87
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:12,260
Yeah, one of the unlocks is a piece of jello. It's the custard game.

88
00:07:12,260 --> 00:07:17,260
And all you do is you poke it with your stylus and it goes boing-boing-boing-boing when you poke it with the stylus.

89
00:07:17,260 --> 00:07:20,260
That's all it is. It's crazy.

90
00:07:20,260 --> 00:07:22,300
But that's the kind of thing you come to expect from WarioWare.

91
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:23,860
So it's all good.

92
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:26,780
All right, let's get into some news that's going on this week.

93
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:28,660
Jamie was mentioning about Xbox.

94
00:07:28,660 --> 00:07:30,840
So this is certainly important to announce.

95
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:33,860
Check the date on the bottom of your Xbox to see when it was

96
00:07:33,860 --> 00:07:38,420
manufactured, because if it was pre-October 2003,

97
00:07:38,420 --> 00:07:42,100
specifically October 23, 2003, you're entitled to a power

98
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:43,060
cord replacement.

99
00:07:43,060 --> 00:07:45,260
Check out Xbox.com for the details.

100
00:07:45,260 --> 00:07:49,780
But apparently, the old power cord was causing some Xboxes

101
00:07:49,780 --> 00:07:57,940
overheat and possibly catch fire careful so we we checked the the date on mine

102
00:07:57,940 --> 00:08:02,020
and luckily it was in 2004 so I'm okay which is good because I'm lazy and I

103
00:08:02,020 --> 00:08:05,420
probably never call the claim I might need to replace yet one for the orange

104
00:08:05,420 --> 00:08:13,580
box because oh wait so check it out you may be eligible for this xbox.com for

105
00:08:13,580 --> 00:08:17,620
more information since you guys love to talk about Final Fantasy 11 and hey I do

106
00:08:17,620 --> 00:08:22,520
do too. It's only natural that we mention this about Final Fantasy XII. Fans that are

107
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:27,320
eager to get their hands on Final Fantasy XII may have to keep waiting. It may not be

108
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:34,160
released in the spring of 2005 as it was previously anticipated. However on the bright side, Squeenix

109
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:39,580
is trying to release a new game every month starting April 1st. April 1st being the two

110
00:08:39,580 --> 00:08:47,300
year anniversary of when Square and Enix merged, or as we lovingly call them, Squeenix.

111
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:52,000
So we're gonna see it at E3 this year again, it sounds like, which is kinda weird.

112
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:58,220
It has then been brought to my attention that it's supposed to be Squenix, because the CEO

113
00:08:58,220 --> 00:09:00,860
of Enix actually said Enix.

114
00:09:00,860 --> 00:09:05,120
Right, and that's fine, calling it Squenix, but I like Squee, like Squee!

115
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:07,440
So we call it Squenix.

116
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:14,200
I know it's not supposed to be Squenix, but you know, who calls it Squenix?

117
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:19,400
Asian girl in the commercial. This is an exciting story

118
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:23,320
for those you guys that are fans of Mario Kart. They're making an arcade

119
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:24,760
version of Mario Kart.

120
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:28,400
Don't get too excited, it's only announced for Japanese arcades right now

121
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:29,520
but then again

122
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:33,400
F-Zero AX was only supposed to be in Japanese arcades at first and it did end

123
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:36,800
up coming to America albeit very limited release because the machines were very

124
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:37,480
expensive.

125
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:41,800
But Mario Kart is coming to Japanese arcades. Here's the weird thing though.

126
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:49,080
It's using the Triforce system, which is Nintendo, Namco, and Sega.

127
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:54,380
Now they haven't said anything about what Sega's involvement is with this game necessarily,

128
00:09:54,380 --> 00:10:00,080
but Namco sure as heck is involved because Ms. Pac-Man and Pac-Man and Blinky are all

129
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:01,660
going to have their own carts.

130
00:10:01,660 --> 00:10:04,040
So you can race Mario versus Pac-Man.

131
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:07,480
And we were kind of talking about this earlier on the three hour show.

132
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:11,440
What if you could play a Sonic or some of the Sega characters?

133
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:13,840
I still hope that Sonic doesn't get a car.

134
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:15,760
Yeah, Sonic would just run alongside him.

135
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:17,720
They also need Mappy.

136
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:19,920
That would be cool, Mappy from Namco.

137
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:22,040
And Nights needs to be in it, but Nights needs to fly.

138
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:24,680
And the dude from Katamari Damacy, the prince.

139
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:26,800
Yeah, he needs to roll a Katamari.

140
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:28,800
You know they're gonna have all these inside jokes

141
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:29,900
in the background and stuff.

142
00:10:29,900 --> 00:10:30,840
Anyway, that's very exciting.

143
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:32,680
It's gonna use the card system as well.

144
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:35,800
You know the, like, Initial D and F-Zero AX had?

145
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:38,480
The little magnetic card that you can use in the game?

146
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:39,960
This is gonna have that as well.

147
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:43,480
so very exciting news keep your fingers crossed that this stuff comes over to

148
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:45,440
america cuz I bet it'll be a big hit

149
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:48,780
even though I don't know if it's just me but arcades

150
00:10:48,780 --> 00:10:52,760
just not as cool as they used to be. It's a bunch of ticket eaters now

151
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:56,760
you know what they need to make another game like star blade was with the giant

152
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:57,760
rotating machine

153
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:01,200
cool they need to

154
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:05,160
something else for me to if I'm gonna pay 75 cents or

155
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:08,480
a dollar a game I want the machine to move with me in it

156
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:11,060
How about just another Dragon's Lair?

157
00:11:11,060 --> 00:11:12,060
Those games are cool.

158
00:11:12,060 --> 00:11:13,060
We do need another game like that.

159
00:11:13,060 --> 00:11:16,140
How about an arcade version caught the Mario Damacy with a trackball?

160
00:11:16,140 --> 00:11:18,740
That'd be cool.

161
00:11:18,740 --> 00:11:20,580
A giant trackball.

162
00:11:20,580 --> 00:11:21,580
Yes.

163
00:11:21,580 --> 00:11:26,220
Here's a game that's been at an arcades recently and it's coming to the console very soon.

164
00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:29,100
Tekken 5 is coming out February 25th.

165
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:34,060
It's the first game that's been released since, of course, Tekken 4 in the Tekken series,

166
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:38,060
but that was back in 2002, so this is the first one we've had in a while.

167
00:11:38,060 --> 00:11:46,060
gonna sell for $49.99. Of course there's going to be a premium set that comes

168
00:11:46,060 --> 00:11:50,480
with a special controller designed specifically for Tekken 5 and a Tekken

169
00:11:50,480 --> 00:12:01,140
themed 6 disc DVD case $99.99 if you want that. So, hmm, PlayStation 2 February 25th.

170
00:12:01,140 --> 00:12:06,460
I know you were a big Tekken girl, Dark Sakura. I love Tekken. Any thoughts on Tekken 5?

171
00:12:06,460 --> 00:12:07,460
Are you excited about this?

172
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:12,420
I'm so happy, and then once the game comes out, I get the poster at Dan's Game Stop to

173
00:12:12,420 --> 00:12:13,420
put in my cubicle.

174
00:12:13,420 --> 00:12:14,420
You just want the free stuff.

175
00:12:14,420 --> 00:12:17,660
Dude, it's coming with, um, the first three!

176
00:12:17,660 --> 00:12:18,660
Alright.

177
00:12:18,660 --> 00:12:23,860
So, how can you go wrong with that, having arcade perfect versions at home?

178
00:12:23,860 --> 00:12:29,860
Instead of having to use our, uh, um, the main cabinet?

179
00:12:29,860 --> 00:12:31,780
How does the Tekken 5 cards work?

180
00:12:31,780 --> 00:12:35,340
I mean, this may sound like such a dumb question, but I never really got into the Tekken games,

181
00:12:35,340 --> 00:12:38,980
especially in the arcades, because the people in the arcades are scary good and I cannot

182
00:12:38,980 --> 00:12:43,180
waste money playing them, they will school me 11 ways from Tuesday.

183
00:12:43,180 --> 00:12:48,760
You can, um, put it, you buy the card, you choose a character and you raise your character

184
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:53,920
on that card. You can actually accessorize them, get them like hats and different outfits

185
00:12:53,920 --> 00:13:00,500
and things. So it's Barbie Tekken. Sort of. But you also save your improvements that you

186
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:02,500
make with the character too.

187
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:08,060
Alright, speaking of improvements, Orange Lounge Radio To Go is here to better your

188
00:13:08,060 --> 00:13:14,700
life and what way to do it better than Dark Sakura and her advice column.

189
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:22,300
Her piece of advice for the week to help make your life a little bit better.

190
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:27,880
Alright and she's going to be giving that to us and she missed out on last week so it

191
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:29,620
has to be twice as good this week.

192
00:13:29,620 --> 00:13:36,620
Today's advice is how to fool a lie detector test, which everyone needs to know in case you're ever arrested.

193
00:13:36,620 --> 00:13:44,620
Number one. Examiners will administer a pre-test before the actual polygraph to create a baseline of reactions.

194
00:13:44,620 --> 00:13:51,620
During the pre-test, force yourself to breathe faster than normal and display confidence. Never appear nervous or shy.

195
00:13:51,620 --> 00:13:56,620
Number two. Maintain eye contact with the examiner. Do not fidget.

196
00:13:56,620 --> 00:14:03,620
Do not, however, sit completely still. Move something subtly but regularly. Your toes, your fingers, hips, etc.

197
00:14:03,620 --> 00:14:10,620
3. Do not try to anticipate the questions you will be asked. Think positive and relaxing thoughts.

198
00:14:10,620 --> 00:14:19,620
4. When answering control questions truthfully, bite your tongue slightly.

199
00:14:19,620 --> 00:14:24,300
This hopefully will give a false reading. Examiners may find it impossible to

200
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:28,620
decipher your test because the readings are inconsistent, as in they show stress

201
00:14:28,620 --> 00:14:33,380
both when you're answering truthfully and when you could be lying. A little bit of

202
00:14:33,380 --> 00:14:38,340
trivia about the polygraph. Interesting. The guy who created the polygraph is

203
00:14:38,340 --> 00:14:45,840
also the creator of Wonder Woman. No way! And her golden lasso is a tribute to the

204
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:51,200
an eye detector. Wow, you learn something new every day. Yeah. This program being no

205
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:59,120
exception. Interesting, so. He was also into bondage and SNM. Thanks for sharing. You know,

206
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:07,280
that explains a lot about Wonder Woman. It really, really does. Yep. Wow. Um, this is

207
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:11,480
interesting because apparently what's going on right now is there's a new bill going around

208
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:17,320
California legislature legislation right now where they are trying to pass a new

209
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:21,320
bill that will limit the sales of M rated games to minors in other words

210
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:26,560
it's gonna make it illegal to sell M rated games to minors what do you guys

211
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:30,640
think about this the games are intended for people over the age of 17 anyway so

212
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:36,080
I don't see why that's a problem is this is this an excuse for lazy parenting

213
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:43,340
though? Yes. As I always say, parents need to do their job. Don't rely on the

214
00:15:43,340 --> 00:15:48,140
government to do your job for you. I'm okay with this law and all. I don't think

215
00:15:48,140 --> 00:15:53,940
it's such a bad thing, but I think it's kind of an excuse in a way, you know. Why

216
00:15:53,940 --> 00:15:56,900
aren't the parents being more involved? The parents should know what games. Who's

217
00:15:56,900 --> 00:16:00,980
giving the money to the kids? Because if you're under 17, chances are you don't

218
00:16:00,980 --> 00:16:04,700
have a job. Maybe you do. Maybe you do. And if that's the case, they're probably

219
00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:08,660
also old enough to know what games are good for you and what games aren't so my

220
00:16:08,660 --> 00:16:12,260
question is if the parents are giving the kids the money shouldn't the parents

221
00:16:12,260 --> 00:16:18,580
know where the money's going I don't get it but I'm okay with the bill I mean

222
00:16:18,580 --> 00:16:22,900
whatever if you have any feedback you can email us to go at orange launch

223
00:16:22,900 --> 00:16:26,940
radio comm anything that has to do with what you hear on the orange launch radio

224
00:16:26,940 --> 00:16:33,300
to go edition again that's to go to go at orange launch radio comm think of

225
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:40,480
Togo and Slana. Exactly. And then think of us. Exactly. Some other interesting

226
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:44,400
announcements going on this week, Midway sent out a press release that they are

227
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:48,680
reviving the Gauntlet series. They're gonna be releasing a game called Gauntlet

228
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:54,360
Seven Sorrows. Need game badly. Blending an intuitive combat system, accessible

229
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:58,360
role-playing game elements, and new junction skills, Seven Sorrows features

230
00:16:58,360 --> 00:17:02,600
the dynamic co-op it's known for and for the first time ever, it is online

231
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:07,400
supporting up to four players hmm so that's pretty cool seven sorrows is the

232
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:11,080
fusion of fantasy fighting action with a strategy of user-friendly RPG elements

233
00:17:11,080 --> 00:17:14,800
providing gamers a deep engaging gameplay experience complete with solo

234
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:19,120
play co-op and an online community the new fighting system allows for easy

235
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:23,360
pickup and play while simultaneously offering deeper choices for more advanced

236
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:26,760
players additionally online role-playing game and collection elements add

237
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:30,360
significant replay value to the game not all coming from their press release

238
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:34,960
remember don't shoot the food so basically this sounds like gauntlet

239
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:39,880
legacy except you know now it's going to be online and I got to admit I wasn't

240
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:45,800
all into gauntlet legacy I mean it was it was okay it was kind of Diablo to me

241
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:52,120
but the original was just so good and then this new one comes along and I

242
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:58,840
don't know it just seems repetitive granted the old one wasn't I don't know

243
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:03,640
repetitive seemed to be okay back then I don't know how to explain it but gauntlet

244
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:07,120
the original didn't feel quite as repetitive as legacy did but maybe it's

245
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:11,480
just me maybe I didn't give the game a fair enough chance any thoughts you know

246
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:19,040
I tried to get into it we played it at home a bit on the n64 but I wasn't even

247
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:23,680
into field gauntlet I had it on Dreamcast I wasn't even into the old

248
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:28,000
gauntlet at all I liked gauntlet 2 on NES how's my favorite Loki any thoughts

249
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:35,200
on gauntlet I like gauntlet legends cuz I is always pojo pojo all the time I was

250
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:40,320
a giant chicken walking around shooting fire was that like a code or something I

251
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:43,560
never knew about that there was a code you could be pojo the entire time and

252
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:51,480
that was I think it was egg and then 911 was the password oh boy

253
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:57,040
interesting and also coming from Midway I think this is interesting they're

254
00:18:57,040 --> 00:19:01,000
They're going to be releasing Midway Arcade Treasures 3.

255
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:04,700
So you know Midway Arcade Treasures has been doing very well, the series.

256
00:19:04,700 --> 00:19:08,540
They're put together really great, and if you're a fan of classic gaming at all, I highly

257
00:19:08,540 --> 00:19:14,880
recommend the games, Midway Arcade Classics 1 and 2, these treasure games.

258
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:18,940
Now they're going to do a 3, but I'm a little weirded out by 3 because this is the deal

259
00:19:18,940 --> 00:19:20,220
with 3.

260
00:19:20,220 --> 00:19:24,360
It's only going to be, it's not going to be 20 games, it's only going to be 8 games because

261
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:26,580
there's somewhat newer games in here.

262
00:19:26,580 --> 00:19:30,000
And here's the other weird thing, they're all racing games.

263
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:35,540
You're gonna get Badlands, Hydro Thunder, Off-Road Thunder, Race Drivin', San Francisco

264
00:19:35,540 --> 00:19:42,560
Rush, San Francisco Rush 2049, Stun Runner, and Super Off-Road and the Bonus Tracks Pack.

265
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:46,040
That sounds cool, that'd be best if it was Multi-Tap or something.

266
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:52,360
Hydro Thunder was pretty cool, Off-Road Thunder was awesome, that game was pretty sweet, and

267
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:56,440
San Francisco Rush and Rush 2049, those are pretty sweet.

268
00:19:56,440 --> 00:20:02,040
they didn't say Arctic Thunder did it? It did not. But it's all about Hydro Thunder

269
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:06,600
because Dan and I on Dreamcast, we played Hydro Thunder like crazy and I used to go

270
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:10,280
play it at the arcade all the time. Now see that's the thing that weirds me out about

271
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:14,040
this is that I'm cool with all these games, they are great games, but for me they're great

272
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:17,880
games in the arcade. There's so much of a difference between like actually sitting in

273
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:21,980
the big Hydro Thunder cabinet and changing the gears and racing and that and having the

274
00:20:21,980 --> 00:20:26,260
the force feedback and everything, there's such a difference between that and the console

275
00:20:26,260 --> 00:20:31,260
experience to me, it's just not the same. I don't know, is it just me?

276
00:20:31,260 --> 00:20:39,940
It's a matter of opinion. I guess. Maybe. This will certainly be worth checking out,

277
00:20:39,940 --> 00:20:45,140
I enjoy Treasures 1 and 2 so much, but I think it's one of those things, to me this strikes

278
00:20:45,140 --> 00:20:49,920
me as something that Midway is just trying to continue to cash in on this Treasure success,

279
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:54,520
they've released all their games now hopefully their port of San Francisco

280
00:20:54,520 --> 00:21:00,600
rush will be better than the PlayStation or the Nintendo 64 versions of that game

281
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:04,040
well these should be hypothetically arcade perfect ports they should be

282
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:09,500
just arcade emulated ports hypothetically well damn I want to see

283
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:16,160
my copy of off-road thunder then for me because I download that shit of course

284
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:23,160
of course all right moving on in video game news I thought this was way and I

285
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:26,840
think this is a good one for us to close on tonight this story was just far too

286
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:31,560
interesting and shocking we did bring it up on the three-hour show but we got to

287
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:37,240
mention it here they're gonna be incorporating a new slash command into

288
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:42,400
EverQuest 2 yes the MMORPG EverQuest 2 and when I say slash command I mean like

289
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:46,300
you know sometimes you could hit slash attack to attack something slash say or

290
00:21:46,300 --> 00:21:50,080
slash shout well now they're gonna be putting in a new command called slash

291
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:55,520
pizza and when you type slash pizza it will bring up a Pizza Hut ordering

292
00:21:55,520 --> 00:22:01,240
window and you can order Pizza Hut Express delivered to you to your door so

293
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:04,720
you have another excuse never to get up from your chair except to go to the

294
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:11,160
bathroom as if people playing EverQuest needed more excuses I what slash

295
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:17,900
commands are gonna come next slash beer slash orgy slash prostitute for blowjob

296
00:22:17,900 --> 00:22:26,660
I mean what it's just I I understand why they're doing it although it's it's got

297
00:22:26,660 --> 00:22:32,540
to be a little bit insulting in a way to here you guys are too lazy to get up and

298
00:22:32,540 --> 00:22:37,740
use the phone we wouldn't want to take you away from your questing they're

299
00:22:37,740 --> 00:22:42,040
facilitating the addictions and you know what I don't think that Final Fantasy 11

300
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:44,800
would ever get something like that one because they have the little disclaimer

301
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:48,300
you know don't forget your real life well now I think to be fair I think

302
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:53,460
EverQuest 2 does have some type of disclaimer and this could just as easily

303
00:22:53,460 --> 00:22:58,100
be built into any I mean it's just EverQuest kind of gets that bad rap to

304
00:22:58,100 --> 00:23:01,500
begin with it but this is something that they could have honestly built in

305
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:07,360
anything crack yeah exactly ever cracked with pizza could I get my pizza with

306
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:13,860
crack on it Loki any thoughts it was this something you'd use probably only

307
00:23:13,860 --> 00:23:19,920
because it's Pizza Hut we I would not be using it only because we don't mean

308
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:25,680
locally so there would be no of no use to me but okay hypothetically there's a

309
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:33,040
Pizza Hut a mile away hell yeah I love Pizza Hut but I don't like online

310
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:38,040
ordering because I mean honestly I've worked at a pizza place I know how dumb

311
00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:43,440
they are there's no way that they can do online ordering very well there's I mean

312
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:48,440
they've got to mess that shit up so and really I mean I have a portable phone

313
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:52,160
right next to my computer I just picked that sucker up and I can order pizza

314
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:57,040
while playing a game at the same time. I mean, you can do it over the phone probably a lot

315
00:23:57,040 --> 00:24:02,160
quicker too and it wouldn't interrupt your gameplay as would a, you know, a giant window

316
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:06,260
over your screen. That and they can repeat back your order to you to make sure they got

317
00:24:06,260 --> 00:24:12,420
it right. Exactly. Alright, to be continued, I'm sure, do you guys think that this will

318
00:24:12,420 --> 00:24:17,380
be a trend? Seeing these more commercial sell out integrations into these games? As somebody

319
00:24:17,380 --> 00:24:20,320
joked during the three hour show, it's just a matter of time before he can buy the pizza

320
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:25,440
a with Gil or gold or whatever the in-game currency is yeah sadly yes and

321
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:29,040
I'm sure it's just a matter of time before we start seeing more of these

322
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:34,160
types of commercial integrations into our favorite online RPGs because we

323
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:41,040
spend so much time in them addicts and on that note that's going to do it for

324
