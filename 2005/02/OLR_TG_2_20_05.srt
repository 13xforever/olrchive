00:00:00,459 --> 00:00:03,962
[SPEAKER_04]: Orange Lounge Radio To Go Edition, week of February 21st, 2005.

2
00:00:04,562 --> 00:00:15,770
[SPEAKER_00]: And now, the Orange Lounge Radio To Go Edition, your internet radio home for discussion on rhythm and music gaming and all the news on video games that don't suck.

3
00:00:16,190 --> 00:00:20,533
[SPEAKER_00]: And now, here are your hosts, DarkSakura, Sky, and Loki.

4
00:00:21,734 --> 00:00:23,075
[SPEAKER_04]: Hello, everybody.

5
00:00:23,515 --> 00:00:28,739
[SPEAKER_04]: One more time, thanks a bunch for tuning in to subscribing, downloading, whatever it did.

6
00:00:29,502 --> 00:00:30,162
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

7
00:00:52,466 --> 00:00:54,308
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm feeling kind of crappy tonight

8
00:01:15,020 --> 00:01:18,421
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's get into video game news that doesn't suck.

9
00:01:18,501 --> 00:01:20,522
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, maybe it's some sucky news, but we'll see.

10
00:01:21,342 --> 00:01:23,043
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, what have you been playing this week?

11
00:01:23,063 --> 00:01:23,663
[SPEAKER_04]: What have you been into?

12
00:01:24,103 --> 00:01:25,664
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess I should say, what have you been playing for the past two weeks?

13
00:01:25,684 --> 00:01:27,484
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been playing Spill the Seven Up on my arm.

14
00:01:28,565 --> 00:01:29,525
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow, what a fun game!

15
00:01:29,625 --> 00:01:30,525
[SPEAKER_04]: Only $49.95 from Nintendo.

16
00:01:30,725 --> 00:01:32,886
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that the sequel to Cool Spot?

17
00:01:34,507 --> 00:01:35,567
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been playing Silent Hill 3.

18
00:01:36,538 --> 00:01:36,678
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh.

19
00:01:37,039 --> 00:01:38,279
[SPEAKER_02]: I need to go clean my arm.

20
00:01:38,299 --> 00:01:38,940
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll come back to me.

21
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:40,021
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, sounds good.

22
00:01:40,081 --> 00:01:41,241
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll go over to Loki.

23
00:01:41,281 --> 00:01:42,342
[SPEAKER_03]: What have you been playing this week?

24
00:01:42,662 --> 00:01:45,004
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been playing My Computer's Broken.

25
00:01:45,564 --> 00:01:46,165
[SPEAKER_03]: What happened?

26
00:01:47,085 --> 00:01:49,087
[SPEAKER_03]: I think the power supply went out.

27
00:01:49,807 --> 00:01:55,151
[SPEAKER_03]: All I know is the power supply was very fucking hot, and I shut off the computer.

28
00:01:55,171 --> 00:01:59,193
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I was running through town as my mule in Final Fantasy XI.

29
00:01:59,234 --> 00:01:59,534
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like...

30
00:02:00,661 --> 00:02:00,801
[SPEAKER_04]: Off.

31
00:02:01,142 --> 00:02:05,405
[SPEAKER_04]: Did your computer finally just decide to tell you, look buddy, you play too much of this damn game.

32
00:02:05,525 --> 00:02:06,165
[SPEAKER_04]: You need a break.

33
00:02:06,566 --> 00:02:10,829
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I think it's the power supply because it was really, really hot.

34
00:02:10,929 --> 00:02:14,892
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I was touching the case and the case was actually burning my fingers.

35
00:02:15,052 --> 00:02:19,175
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, that's not usually a good sign if that's happening.

36
00:02:19,675 --> 00:02:21,537
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think the power supply is just shot.

37
00:02:21,957 --> 00:02:23,578
[SPEAKER_03]: Could be all the dust that was in there.

38
00:02:24,279 --> 00:02:28,702
[SPEAKER_03]: It might have stopped the fan and then the power supply overheated and just died.

39
00:02:29,282 --> 00:02:31,644
[SPEAKER_03]: So I got Binding Power Supply and that sucks.

40
00:02:32,084 --> 00:02:36,867
[SPEAKER_03]: Before that, I was playing Final Fantasy XI, a little bit of Matrix Online.

41
00:02:38,007 --> 00:02:42,450
[SPEAKER_03]: And when I say a little bit of Matrix Online, I cannot stress how little I've been playing.

42
00:02:42,710 --> 00:02:47,233
[SPEAKER_03]: I played through the tutorial again and got bored with it again.

43
00:02:47,533 --> 00:02:50,154
[SPEAKER_03]: And then, what else did I do?

44
00:02:52,543 --> 00:03:19,118
[SPEAKER_03]: I was playing this stupid game that was like it was another freeware game where you launch gnomes into the air and you like see how far you can get them to fly and I don't know that was amusing for about five minutes and then uh that's about all I've been playing I'm gonna actually start getting into some more console games this week since my computer's down so now heaven forbid yeah you might have to play some console games this week what are you gonna do

45
00:03:20,290 --> 00:03:36,727
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I'm hopefully going to get my Grand Theft Auto San Andreas back because I want to play that, but if not, I guess, Shudder, I guess I could start and play through, maybe, with cheating, of course, because I can't play these games legitimately.

46
00:03:37,027 --> 00:03:38,108
[SPEAKER_03]: Final Fantasy X2.

47
00:03:38,709 --> 00:03:39,369
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh my gosh.

48
00:03:40,270 --> 00:03:40,631
[SPEAKER_01]: Ten.

49
00:03:41,692 --> 00:03:42,052
[SPEAKER_04]: Whatever.

50
00:03:43,354 --> 00:03:43,734
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

51
00:03:45,031 --> 00:03:50,213
[SPEAKER_04]: This was a big issue a while back on the three-hour program that we do over at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

52
00:03:50,553 --> 00:03:52,193
[SPEAKER_04]: We actually wrote Squeenix.

53
00:03:52,273 --> 00:03:55,094
[SPEAKER_04]: We wrote them an email and said, you need to tell us how this is pronounced.

54
00:03:55,174 --> 00:03:56,874
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it X2 or 10-2?

55
00:03:57,214 --> 00:04:00,135
[SPEAKER_04]: Because this is a huge argument between Jamie and our chat room.

56
00:04:00,395 --> 00:04:01,616
[SPEAKER_04]: And it turns out Jamie was right.

57
00:04:01,636 --> 00:04:02,696
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm always right.

58
00:04:03,376 --> 00:04:04,136
[SPEAKER_04]: It's 10-2.

59
00:04:05,197 --> 00:04:06,277
[SPEAKER_04]: It's so silly, though.

60
00:04:06,317 --> 00:04:06,817
[SPEAKER_04]: It's 10-2.

61
00:04:06,897 --> 00:04:08,638
[SPEAKER_04]: But, I mean, it makes sense at the same time.

62
00:04:08,658 --> 00:04:10,158
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you call this Final Fantasy X-I?

63
00:04:11,158 --> 00:04:11,739
[SPEAKER_04]: and Super Punch-Out!! !

64
00:04:27,734 --> 00:04:28,894
[SPEAKER_04]: Right on, Super Punch-Out!

65
00:04:29,315 --> 00:04:29,875
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, you know what?

66
00:04:29,895 --> 00:04:30,555
[SPEAKER_04]: Super Punch-Out!

67
00:04:30,795 --> 00:04:33,696
[SPEAKER_04]: If I remember right, it kind of came out towards the end of the Super Nintendo.

68
00:04:33,996 --> 00:04:35,696
[SPEAKER_04]: It was kind of overlooked, it feels like.

69
00:04:35,716 --> 00:04:36,837
[SPEAKER_02]: It was in the high day.

70
00:04:37,337 --> 00:04:40,058
[SPEAKER_04]: It seems like not a lot of people knew about Super Punch-Out!

71
00:04:40,138 --> 00:04:41,918
[SPEAKER_04]: Everybody knew Mike Tyson's Punch-Out!

72
00:04:42,338 --> 00:04:44,119
[SPEAKER_02]: Not a lot of people were in there.

73
00:04:44,239 --> 00:04:45,159
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe it was just my neck of the woods.

74
00:04:45,579 --> 00:04:45,839
[SPEAKER_04]: Gradius 3?

75
00:04:46,419 --> 00:04:46,800
[SPEAKER_04]: Good choice.

76
00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:51,701
[SPEAKER_02]: Which is like the only version I think that Dan and I could beat.

77
00:04:52,121 --> 00:04:53,161
[SPEAKER_02]: The Super Nintendo one.

78
00:04:53,361 --> 00:04:54,722
[SPEAKER_04]: What possessed you to get into Silent Hill 3?

79
00:04:55,925 --> 00:04:56,665
[SPEAKER_04]: As opposed to four.

80
00:04:56,845 --> 00:04:57,926
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, okay.

81
00:04:58,866 --> 00:05:00,727
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, the Xbox wasn't hooked up.

82
00:05:01,927 --> 00:05:02,908
[SPEAKER_02]: That was it.

83
00:05:03,288 --> 00:05:04,648
[SPEAKER_04]: It's as simple as that sometimes.

84
00:05:05,069 --> 00:05:05,689
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that was it.

85
00:05:07,910 --> 00:05:10,671
[SPEAKER_04]: As for games I've been playing this week, WarioWare Touched.

86
00:05:10,871 --> 00:05:12,651
[SPEAKER_04]: I went out and got Tuesday the day it came out.

87
00:05:12,751 --> 00:05:16,153
[SPEAKER_04]: I love the WarioWare original on Game Boy Advance.

88
00:05:16,773 --> 00:05:22,015
[SPEAKER_04]: Wasn't such a fan of the one on Game Boy, or not Game Boy, GameCube, because...

89
00:05:22,839 --> 00:05:26,940
[SPEAKER_04]: The problem with it for me is it was just a rehashed version of the same thing I'd already played.

90
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:40,323
[SPEAKER_04]: And not that it was necessarily a bad game per se, because the multiplayer stuff was hilarious, but I just got really annoyed that I fell into that Nintendo trap of buying the same thing, just a little bit better, a little newer.

91
00:05:40,883 --> 00:05:43,144
[SPEAKER_04]: So it made me mad, and I only played it a couple times.

92
00:05:43,464 --> 00:05:47,184
[SPEAKER_04]: But now, WarioWare Touched is out, and it's not a rehashed version.

93
00:05:47,224 --> 00:05:48,025
[SPEAKER_04]: It's got like 180 new games.

94
00:05:50,091 --> 00:05:50,732
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

95
00:06:11,377 --> 00:06:12,879
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just so cool with the pen.

96
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:18,405
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a little weird because they have microphone games mixed in now, and every microphone game is some type of blowing.

97
00:06:18,445 --> 00:06:21,068
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's like, draw, draw, draw, draw, draw, draw.

98
00:06:22,450 --> 00:06:30,639
[SPEAKER_04]: It's kind of WarioWare, but hey, if you like the original WarioWare, if you like Feel the Magic XXXY, very similar, you'll like WarioWare Touched.

99
00:06:31,059 --> 00:06:31,760
[SPEAKER_03]: I recommend it.

100
00:06:32,759 --> 00:06:34,179
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, the parrot minigame is very cool.

101
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:38,541
[SPEAKER_03]: Because we couldn't get to work at first, but then we finally did, and that was the best.

102
00:06:39,241 --> 00:06:41,042
[SPEAKER_04]: Some of the unlocks are so weird.

103
00:06:41,362 --> 00:06:43,543
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, the original WarioWare had some awesome unlocks.

104
00:06:43,563 --> 00:06:52,766
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, it had Dr. Wario that you could get in it, and it had the little game you got with the little bird that would eat the things that fall down from the sky.

105
00:06:53,426 --> 00:06:56,447
[SPEAKER_04]: WarioWare Touch doesn't have quite the same cool unlocks.

106
00:06:56,487 --> 00:06:58,388
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, you can unlock a calculator.

107
00:06:59,408 --> 00:07:01,609
[SPEAKER_04]: You can unlock a fortune teller.

108
00:07:02,540 --> 00:07:04,542
[SPEAKER_04]: You can unlock a yo-yo.

109
00:07:05,623 --> 00:07:07,524
[SPEAKER_04]: What was the gelatin thing?

110
00:07:07,544 --> 00:07:10,367
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, one of the unlocks is a piece of jello.

111
00:07:11,088 --> 00:07:12,129
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the custard game.

112
00:07:12,429 --> 00:07:17,533
[SPEAKER_04]: And all you do is you poke it with your stylus and it goes boing, boing, boing when you poke it with the stylus.

113
00:07:17,573 --> 00:07:18,154
[SPEAKER_04]: That's all it is.

114
00:07:19,175 --> 00:07:19,815
[SPEAKER_04]: It's crazy.

115
00:07:20,236 --> 00:07:22,798
[SPEAKER_04]: But that's the kind of thing you come to expect from WarioWare, so it's all good.

116
00:07:23,857 --> 00:07:26,058
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, let's get into some news that's going on this week.

117
00:07:26,738 --> 00:07:30,460
[SPEAKER_04]: Jamie was mentioning about Xbox, so this is certainly important to announce.

118
00:07:30,820 --> 00:07:42,966
[SPEAKER_04]: Check the date on the bottom of your Xbox to see when it was manufactured, because if it was pre-October 2003, specifically October 23rd, 2003, you're entitled to a power cord replacement.

119
00:07:43,006 --> 00:07:44,887
[SPEAKER_04]: Check out Xbox.com for the details.

120
00:07:45,267 --> 00:07:52,371
[SPEAKER_04]: But apparently, the old power cord was causing some Xboxes to overheat and possibly catch fire.

121
00:07:53,607 --> 00:07:53,987
[SPEAKER_04]: Careful.

122
00:07:54,848 --> 00:07:58,970
[SPEAKER_04]: So we checked the date on mine, and luckily it was in 2004.

123
00:08:00,090 --> 00:08:03,012
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm okay, which is good because I'm lazy, and I probably would have never filed a claim.

124
00:08:03,092 --> 00:08:07,174
[SPEAKER_03]: I might need to replace you for the orange box because... Oh, wait.

125
00:08:09,715 --> 00:08:11,276
[SPEAKER_04]: So check it out.

126
00:08:11,316 --> 00:08:12,557
[SPEAKER_04]: You may be eligible for this.

127
00:08:12,697 --> 00:08:14,097
[SPEAKER_04]: Xbox.com for more information.

128
00:08:14,578 --> 00:08:20,881
[SPEAKER_04]: Since you guys love to talk about Final Fantasy XI, and hey, I do too, it's only natural that we mention this about Final Fantasy XII.

129
00:08:22,079 --> 00:08:24,301
[SPEAKER_04]: Final Fantasy XII Final Fantasy XII Final Fantasy XII Final Fantasy XII

130
00:08:51,834 --> 00:08:52,434
[SPEAKER_02]: Squenix, Squenix

131
00:09:17,677 --> 00:09:21,918
[SPEAKER_04]: This is an exciting story for those of you guys that are fans of Mario Kart.

132
00:09:22,158 --> 00:09:24,639
[SPEAKER_04]: They're making an arcade version of Mario Kart.

133
00:09:24,939 --> 00:09:25,879
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't get too excited.

134
00:09:25,939 --> 00:09:37,342
[SPEAKER_04]: It's only announced for Japanese arcades right now, but then again, F-Zero AX was only supposed to be in Japanese arcades at first, and it did end up coming to America, albeit very limited release because the machines were very expensive.

135
00:09:37,882 --> 00:09:40,403
[SPEAKER_04]: But Mario Kart is coming to Japanese arcades.

136
00:09:40,463 --> 00:09:41,603
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's the weird thing, though.

137
00:09:42,283 --> 00:09:45,744
[SPEAKER_04]: It's using the Triforce system, which is Nintendo...

138
00:09:46,545 --> 00:09:57,589
[SPEAKER_04]: Namco, and Sega now they haven't said anything about what Sega's involvement is with this game necessarily but Namco sure as heck is involved because Ms.

139
00:09:57,629 --> 00:10:13,154
[SPEAKER_04]: Pac-Man and Pac-Man and Blinky are all going to have their own karts so you can race Mario vs. Pac-Man and we were kind of talking about this earlier on the 3 hour show what if you could play as Sonic or some of the Sega characters I still hope that Sonic doesn't get a car

140
00:10:13,891 --> 00:10:15,492
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, Sonic would just run alongside him.

141
00:10:15,753 --> 00:10:16,633
[SPEAKER_02]: They also need Mappy.

142
00:10:17,714 --> 00:10:18,575
[SPEAKER_04]: That would be cool.

143
00:10:18,635 --> 00:10:19,576
[SPEAKER_04]: Mappy from Namco.

144
00:10:20,016 --> 00:10:21,958
[SPEAKER_02]: And Knights needs to be in it, but Knights needs to fly.

145
00:10:22,038 --> 00:10:23,960
[SPEAKER_04]: And the dude from Katamari Damashii, the prince.

146
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:26,102
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, he needs to roll to Katamari.

147
00:10:26,882 --> 00:10:29,665
[SPEAKER_04]: You know they're going to have all these inside jokes in the background and stuff.

148
00:10:29,965 --> 00:10:30,826
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, that's very exciting.

149
00:10:30,846 --> 00:10:32,507
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to use the card system as well.

150
00:10:32,707 --> 00:10:35,570
[SPEAKER_04]: You know the initial D and F-Zero AX had?

151
00:10:35,830 --> 00:10:37,832
[SPEAKER_04]: The little magnetic card that you can use in the game?

152
00:10:38,484 --> 00:10:39,584
[SPEAKER_04]: This is going to have that as well.

153
00:10:40,004 --> 00:10:41,285
[SPEAKER_04]: So very exciting news.

154
00:10:41,685 --> 00:10:45,306
[SPEAKER_04]: Keep your fingers crossed that this stuff comes over to America because I bet it'll be a big hit.

155
00:10:45,706 --> 00:10:50,247
[SPEAKER_04]: Even though, I don't know if it's just me, but arcades are just not as cool as they used to be.

156
00:10:50,707 --> 00:10:52,627
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a bunch of ticket eaters now.

157
00:10:53,507 --> 00:10:53,967
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what?

158
00:10:54,067 --> 00:10:57,608
[SPEAKER_02]: They need to make another game like Starblade was with the giant rotating machine.

159
00:10:59,369 --> 00:10:59,689
[SPEAKER_04]: Cool.

160
00:11:00,549 --> 00:11:01,009
[SPEAKER_02]: They need to.

161
00:11:01,727 --> 00:11:08,392
[SPEAKER_02]: Something else for me to... If I'm going to pay 75 cents or a dollar a game, I want the machine to move with me in it.

162
00:11:09,253 --> 00:11:10,474
[SPEAKER_04]: How about just another Dragon's Lair?

163
00:11:10,954 --> 00:11:11,695
[SPEAKER_04]: Those games are cool.

164
00:11:11,775 --> 00:11:12,836
[SPEAKER_03]: We do need another game like that.

165
00:11:12,856 --> 00:11:15,918
[SPEAKER_03]: How about an arcade version of Katamari Damacy with a trackball?

166
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:18,100
[SPEAKER_03]: That'd be cool.

167
00:11:18,801 --> 00:11:19,922
[SPEAKER_02]: A giant trackball.

168
00:11:20,262 --> 00:11:20,562
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

169
00:11:22,243 --> 00:11:25,826
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's a game that's been out in arcades recently, and it's coming to the console very soon.

170
00:11:25,906 --> 00:11:28,348
[SPEAKER_04]: Tekken 5 is coming out February 25th.

171
00:11:29,875 --> 00:11:33,678
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the first game that's been released since, of course, Tekken 4 in the Tekken series.

172
00:11:33,958 --> 00:11:37,421
[SPEAKER_04]: But that was back in 2002, so this is the first one we've had in a while.

173
00:11:37,961 --> 00:11:39,002
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to sell for $49.99.

174
00:11:39,543 --> 00:11:54,314
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course, there's going to be a premium set that comes with a special controller designed specifically for Tekken 5 and a Tekken-themed 6-disc DVD case, $99.99 if you want that.

175
00:11:59,528 --> 00:12:06,290
[SPEAKER_04]: PlayStation 2, February 25th I know you were a big Tekken girl, DarkSakura I love Tekken Any thoughts on Tekken 5?

176
00:12:06,490 --> 00:12:22,553
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm so happy, and then once the game comes out, I get the poster at Dan's GameStop You just want the free stuff Dude, it's coming with the first three Alright So how can you go wrong with that, having arcade-perfect versions at home?

177
00:12:23,616 --> 00:12:28,697
[SPEAKER_02]: instead of having to use our the main cabinet.

178
00:12:29,797 --> 00:12:31,597
[SPEAKER_04]: How does the Tekken 5 cards work?

179
00:12:31,877 --> 00:12:39,959
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, this may sound like such a dumb question, but I never really got into the Tekken games, especially in the arcades, because the people in the arcades are scary good, and I cannot waste money playing them.

180
00:12:39,999 --> 00:12:42,179
[SPEAKER_04]: They will school me 11 ways from Tuesday.

181
00:12:43,099 --> 00:12:49,400
[SPEAKER_02]: You can put it, you buy the card, and you choose a character, and you raise your character on that card.

182
00:12:50,041 --> 00:12:52,721
[SPEAKER_02]: You can actually accessorize them, get them like hats and

183
00:12:53,442 --> 00:12:55,463
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's Barbie Tekken.

184
00:12:56,704 --> 00:12:57,084
[SPEAKER_02]: Sort of.

185
00:12:57,624 --> 00:13:01,427
[SPEAKER_02]: But you also save your improvements that you make with the character too.

186
00:13:02,527 --> 00:13:02,787
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

187
00:13:04,268 --> 00:13:14,354
[SPEAKER_04]: Speaking of improvements, Orange Lounge Radio To Go is here to better your life and what way to do it better than DarkSakura and her advice column.

188
00:13:14,634 --> 00:13:18,236
[SPEAKER_04]: Her piece of advice for the week to help make your life a little bit better.

189
00:13:28,253 --> 00:13:35,737
[SPEAKER_02]: Today's advice is how to fool a lie detector test, which everyone needs to know in case you're ever arrested.

190
00:13:37,318 --> 00:13:44,482
[SPEAKER_02]: Number one, examiners will administer a pre-test before the actual polygraph to create a baseline of reactions.

191
00:13:45,203 --> 00:13:48,865
[SPEAKER_02]: During the pretest, force yourself to breathe faster than normal and display confidence.

192
00:13:49,366 --> 00:13:50,867
[SPEAKER_02]: Never appear nervous or shy.

193
00:13:52,168 --> 00:13:55,550
[SPEAKER_02]: Number two, maintain eye contact with the examiner.

194
00:13:55,650 --> 00:13:56,430
[SPEAKER_02]: Do not fidget.

195
00:13:56,811 --> 00:13:58,852
[SPEAKER_02]: Do not, however, sit completely still.

196
00:13:59,372 --> 00:14:01,173
[SPEAKER_02]: Move something subtly but regularly.

197
00:14:01,273 --> 00:14:03,115
[SPEAKER_02]: Your toes, your fingers, hips, etc.

198
00:14:03,855 --> 00:14:07,798
[SPEAKER_02]: Number three, do not try to anticipate the questions you will be asked.

199
00:14:08,238 --> 00:14:10,159
[SPEAKER_02]: Think positive and relaxing thoughts.

200
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:12,801
[SPEAKER_02]: And the last one, number four, when answering questions,

201
00:14:15,904 --> 00:14:19,287
[SPEAKER_02]: When answering control questions truthfully, bite your tongue slightly.

202
00:14:20,568 --> 00:14:22,209
[SPEAKER_02]: This hopefully will give a false reading.

203
00:14:22,750 --> 00:14:31,658
[SPEAKER_02]: Examiners may find it impossible to decipher your test because the readings are inconsistent, as in they show stress both when you're answering truthfully and when you could be lying.

204
00:14:32,939 --> 00:14:34,760
[SPEAKER_02]: A little bit of trivia about the polygraph.

205
00:14:36,081 --> 00:14:36,642
[SPEAKER_04]: Interesting.

206
00:14:36,702 --> 00:14:39,965
[SPEAKER_02]: The guy who created the polygraph is also the creator of Wonder Woman.

207
00:14:40,928 --> 00:14:41,468
[SPEAKER_04]: No way.

208
00:14:41,849 --> 00:14:46,392
[SPEAKER_02]: And her golden lasso is a tribute to the lie detector.

209
00:14:47,752 --> 00:14:48,093
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow.

210
00:14:48,513 --> 00:14:49,694
[SPEAKER_04]: You learn something new every day.

211
00:14:49,934 --> 00:14:50,154
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.

212
00:14:50,234 --> 00:14:51,635
[SPEAKER_04]: This program being no exception.

213
00:14:52,075 --> 00:14:52,475
[SPEAKER_04]: Interesting.

214
00:14:52,575 --> 00:14:54,877
[SPEAKER_02]: He was also into bondage and SNM.

215
00:14:56,098 --> 00:14:57,178
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for sharing.

216
00:14:58,579 --> 00:15:01,061
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, that explains a lot about Wonder Woman.

217
00:15:01,121 --> 00:15:02,122
[SPEAKER_04]: It really, really does.

218
00:15:02,682 --> 00:15:02,862
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.

219
00:15:03,502 --> 00:15:03,703
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow.

220
00:15:06,977 --> 00:15:20,780
[SPEAKER_04]: This is interesting because apparently what's going on right now is there's a new bill going around the California legislation right now where they are trying to pass a new bill that will limit the sales of M-rated games to minors.

221
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:26,261
[SPEAKER_04]: In other words, it's going to make it illegal to sell M-rated games to minors.

222
00:15:26,301 --> 00:15:27,221
[SPEAKER_03]: What do you guys think about this?

223
00:15:27,921 --> 00:15:33,322
[SPEAKER_03]: The games are intended for people over the age of 17 anyway, so I don't see why that's a problem.

224
00:15:33,762 --> 00:15:36,263
[SPEAKER_03]: Is this an excuse for lazy parenting though?

225
00:15:37,093 --> 00:15:37,394
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

226
00:15:39,257 --> 00:15:42,022
[SPEAKER_02]: As I always say, parents need to do their job.

227
00:15:42,723 --> 00:15:44,927
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't rely on the government to do your job for you.

228
00:15:46,070 --> 00:15:47,713
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm okay with this law and all.

229
00:15:47,793 --> 00:15:49,917
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think it's such a bad thing, but I think...

230
00:15:50,620 --> 00:15:53,462
[SPEAKER_04]: It's kind of an excuse, in a way, you know?

231
00:15:53,842 --> 00:15:55,643
[SPEAKER_04]: Why aren't the parents being more involved?

232
00:15:55,663 --> 00:15:56,764
[SPEAKER_04]: The parents should know what games.

233
00:15:56,804 --> 00:15:58,345
[SPEAKER_04]: Who's giving the money to the kids?

234
00:15:58,806 --> 00:16:01,567
[SPEAKER_04]: Because if you're under 17, chances are you don't have a job.

235
00:16:01,607 --> 00:16:02,848
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe you do, maybe you do.

236
00:16:03,188 --> 00:16:07,611
[SPEAKER_04]: And if that's the case, you're probably also old enough to know what games are good for you and what games aren't.

237
00:16:08,092 --> 00:16:13,075
[SPEAKER_04]: So, my question is, if the parents are giving the kids the money, shouldn't the parents know where the money's going?

238
00:16:13,816 --> 00:16:14,256
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't get it.

239
00:16:16,057 --> 00:16:18,118
[SPEAKER_04]: But, I'm okay with the bill.

240
00:16:18,399 --> 00:16:18,839
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, whatever.

241
00:16:18,859 --> 00:16:19,019
[SPEAKER_04]: Whatever.

242
00:16:19,923 --> 00:16:23,586
[SPEAKER_04]: If you have any feedback, you can email us togo at orange lounge radio dot com.

243
00:16:23,666 --> 00:16:27,709
[SPEAKER_04]: Anything that has to do with what you hear on the Orange Lounge Radio to go edition.

244
00:16:28,090 --> 00:16:32,954
[SPEAKER_04]: Again, that's to go to go at orange lounge radio dot com.

245
00:16:33,034 --> 00:16:34,235
[SPEAKER_01]: Think of Togo and Slana.

246
00:16:34,675 --> 00:16:34,975
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.

247
00:16:34,995 --> 00:16:35,736
[SPEAKER_01]: And then think of us.

248
00:16:36,597 --> 00:16:36,997
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly.

249
00:16:38,898 --> 00:16:39,319
[SPEAKER_04]: Some other.

250
00:16:39,958 --> 00:16:42,281
[SPEAKER_04]: Interesting announcements going on this week.

251
00:16:42,401 --> 00:16:46,385
[SPEAKER_04]: Midway sent out a press release that they are reviving the Gauntlet series.

252
00:16:46,746 --> 00:16:49,949
[SPEAKER_04]: They're going to be releasing a game called Gauntlet Seven Sorrows.

253
00:16:50,109 --> 00:16:51,551
[SPEAKER_04]: Need game badly.

254
00:16:51,691 --> 00:17:01,322
[SPEAKER_04]: Blending an intuitive combat system, accessible role-playing game elements, and new junction skills, Seven Sorrows features the dynamic co-op it's known for, and for the first time ever,

255
00:17:01,792 --> 00:17:04,534
[SPEAKER_04]: It is online, supporting up to four players.

256
00:17:04,954 --> 00:17:05,995
[SPEAKER_04]: Hmm, so that's pretty cool.

257
00:17:06,655 --> 00:17:17,302
[SPEAKER_04]: Seven Sorrows is the fusion of fantasy fighting action with a strategy of user-friendly RPG elements, providing gamers a deep, engaging gameplay experience, complete with solo play, co-op, and an online community.

258
00:17:17,362 --> 00:17:23,907
[SPEAKER_04]: The new fighting system allows for easy pick-up and play, while simultaneously offering deeper choices for more advanced players.

259
00:17:24,387 --> 00:17:29,070
[SPEAKER_04]: Additionally, online role-playing game and collection elements add significant replay value to the game.

260
00:17:29,110 --> 00:17:30,491
[SPEAKER_04]: That all coming from their press release.

261
00:17:30,831 --> 00:17:57,442
[SPEAKER_04]: remember don't shoot the food so basically this sounds like Gauntlet Legacy except you know now it's going to be online and I gotta admit I wasn't all into Gauntlet Legacy I mean it was it was okay it was kind of Diablo to me but the original was just so good and then this new one comes along and I don't know it just seems repetitive granted the old one wasn't

262
00:17:58,567 --> 00:18:01,089
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know, repetitive seemed to be okay back then.

263
00:18:01,149 --> 00:18:02,270
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know how to explain it.

264
00:18:02,651 --> 00:18:06,654
[SPEAKER_04]: But Gauntlet, the original, didn't feel quite as repetitive as Legacy did.

265
00:18:06,694 --> 00:18:07,535
[SPEAKER_04]: But maybe it's just me.

266
00:18:07,615 --> 00:18:09,196
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe I didn't give the game a fair enough chance.

267
00:18:09,337 --> 00:18:09,717
[SPEAKER_04]: Any thoughts?

268
00:18:11,258 --> 00:18:13,340
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I tried to get into it.

269
00:18:13,380 --> 00:18:15,562
[SPEAKER_02]: We played it at home a bit on the N64.

270
00:18:16,503 --> 00:18:17,063
[SPEAKER_02]: But, eh.

271
00:18:18,545 --> 00:18:19,866
[SPEAKER_02]: I wasn't even into the old Gauntlet.

272
00:18:20,366 --> 00:18:21,347
[SPEAKER_04]: I had it on Dreamcast.

273
00:18:22,388 --> 00:18:24,590
[SPEAKER_02]: I wasn't even into the old Gauntlet at all.

274
00:18:24,963 --> 00:18:26,424
[SPEAKER_04]: I liked Gauntlet 2 on NES.

275
00:18:26,584 --> 00:18:27,145
[SPEAKER_03]: That was my favorite.

276
00:18:27,445 --> 00:18:28,465
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki, any thoughts on Gauntlet?

277
00:18:29,026 --> 00:18:31,708
[SPEAKER_03]: I like Gauntlet Legends because I was always Pojo.

278
00:18:33,969 --> 00:18:35,070
[SPEAKER_03]: Pojo all the time.

279
00:18:35,110 --> 00:18:36,571
[SPEAKER_03]: I was a giant chicken walking around.

280
00:18:37,892 --> 00:18:38,652
[SPEAKER_03]: Shooting fire.

281
00:18:39,273 --> 00:18:40,274
[SPEAKER_03]: Was that like a code or something?

282
00:18:40,294 --> 00:18:40,774
[SPEAKER_03]: I never knew about that.

283
00:18:40,794 --> 00:18:41,414
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, there was a code.

284
00:18:41,434 --> 00:18:43,015
[SPEAKER_03]: You could be Pojo the entire time.

285
00:18:43,596 --> 00:18:49,420
[SPEAKER_03]: And that was... I think it was egg and then 911 was the password.

286
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:50,400
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh boy.

287
00:18:50,421 --> 00:18:52,002
[SPEAKER_03]: Interesting.

288
00:18:52,042 --> 00:18:52,502
[SPEAKER_03]: Interesting.

289
00:18:53,957 --> 00:18:54,938
[SPEAKER_04]: Midway Arcade Treasures 3

290
00:19:14,875 --> 00:19:19,238
[SPEAKER_04]: Now they're going to do a 3, but I'm a little weirded out by 3 because this is the deal with 3.

291
00:19:20,159 --> 00:19:26,123
[SPEAKER_04]: It's only going to be, it's not going to be 20 games, it's only going to be 8 games because there's somewhat newer games in here.

292
00:19:26,563 --> 00:19:29,225
[SPEAKER_04]: And here's the other weird thing, they're all racing games.

293
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:42,209
[SPEAKER_04]: Badlands, Hydro Thunder, Offroad Thunder, Race Drivin', San Francisco Rush, San Francisco Rush 2049, Stun Runner, Super Offroad, and the bonus Trax Pack.

294
00:19:42,509 --> 00:19:43,109
[SPEAKER_03]: That sounds cool.

295
00:19:43,129 --> 00:19:45,751
[SPEAKER_03]: That'd be best if it was multi-tap or something.

296
00:19:46,091 --> 00:19:47,512
[SPEAKER_03]: Hydro Thunder was pretty cool.

297
00:19:47,733 --> 00:19:49,133
[SPEAKER_03]: Offroad Thunder was awesome.

298
00:19:49,454 --> 00:19:51,015
[SPEAKER_03]: That game was pretty sweet.

299
00:19:51,395 --> 00:19:56,138
[SPEAKER_03]: And San Francisco Rush and Rush 2049, those are pretty sweet.

300
00:19:56,339 --> 00:19:58,320
[SPEAKER_02]: They didn't say Arctic Thunder, did it?

301
00:19:58,680 --> 00:19:59,121
[SPEAKER_03]: It did not.

302
00:19:59,661 --> 00:19:59,721
[SPEAKER_02]: Ah.

303
00:20:00,202 --> 00:20:29,951
[SPEAKER_04]: but it's all about Hydro Thunder because Dan and I on Dreamcast we played Hydro Thunder like crazy and I used to go play it at the arcade all the time now see that's the thing that weirds me out about this is that I'm cool with all these games they are great games but for me they're great games in the arcade there's so much of a difference between like actually sitting in the big Hydro Thunder cabinet and changing the gears and racing and that and having the force feedback and everything there's such a difference between that and the console experience to me it's just not the same I don't know is it just me

304
00:20:34,045 --> 00:20:37,298
[SPEAKER_04]: it's a matter of opinion I guess, maybe

305
00:20:38,266 --> 00:20:39,928
[SPEAKER_04]: This will certainly be worth checking out.

306
00:20:40,048 --> 00:20:51,437
[SPEAKER_04]: I enjoy Treasures 1 and 2 so much, but I think it's one of those things, to me, this strikes me as something that Midway is just trying to continue to cash in on this Treasure success, but they've released all their games now.

307
00:20:51,457 --> 00:21:00,644
[SPEAKER_03]: Hopefully their port of San Francisco Rush will be better than the PlayStation or the Nintendo 64 versions of that game.

308
00:21:00,664 --> 00:21:03,566
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, these should be, hypothetically, arcade-perfect ports.

309
00:21:03,686 --> 00:21:05,308
[SPEAKER_04]: They should be just arcade-emulated ports.

310
00:21:06,188 --> 00:21:06,769
[SPEAKER_04]: Hypothetically.

311
00:21:08,288 --> 00:21:14,930
[SPEAKER_03]: Well damn, I want to see my copy of Offroad Thunder then for MAME because I want to download that shit.

312
00:21:15,791 --> 00:21:16,811
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course, of course.

313
00:21:17,851 --> 00:21:19,872
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, moving on in video game news.

314
00:21:20,092 --> 00:21:25,194
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought this was way, and I think this is a good one for us to close on tonight.

315
00:21:25,234 --> 00:21:28,335
[SPEAKER_04]: This story was just far too interesting and shocking.

316
00:21:28,375 --> 00:21:32,256
[SPEAKER_04]: We did bring it up on the three hour show, but we gotta mention it here.

317
00:21:33,037 --> 00:21:37,138
[SPEAKER_04]: They're gonna be incorporating a new slash command into

318
00:21:37,952 --> 00:21:38,873
[SPEAKER_04]: EverQuest 2.

319
00:21:38,973 --> 00:21:40,413
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, the MMORPG EverQuest 2.

320
00:21:40,574 --> 00:21:47,077
[SPEAKER_04]: And when I say slash command, I mean like, you know, sometimes you get hit slash attack to attack something, slash say or slash shout.

321
00:21:47,758 --> 00:21:50,799
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, now they're going to be putting in a new command called slash pizza.

322
00:21:51,920 --> 00:22:02,366
[SPEAKER_04]: And when you type slash pizza, it will bring up a Pizza Hut ordering window and you can order Pizza Hut express delivered to your door so you have another excuse to

323
00:22:02,842 --> 00:22:12,667
[SPEAKER_04]: Never to get up from your chair except to go to the bathroom As if people playing EverQuest needed more excuses What slash commands are going to come next?

324
00:22:12,827 --> 00:22:13,628
[SPEAKER_04]: Slash beer?

325
00:22:14,248 --> 00:22:18,350
[SPEAKER_04]: Slash orgy Slash prostitute for blowjob?

326
00:22:18,410 --> 00:22:18,890
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, what?

327
00:22:22,332 --> 00:22:29,156
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just, I understand why they're doing it Although it's got to be a little bit insulting in a way, too

328
00:22:30,606 --> 00:22:33,349
[SPEAKER_04]: Here, you guys are too lazy to get up and use the phone.

329
00:22:35,530 --> 00:22:37,412
[SPEAKER_04]: We wouldn't want to take you away from your questing.

330
00:22:37,612 --> 00:22:39,054
[SPEAKER_02]: They're facilitating the addictions.

331
00:22:39,214 --> 00:22:39,854
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know what?

332
00:22:39,974 --> 00:22:46,160
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think that Final Fantasy XI would ever get something like that one because they have the little disclaimer, you know, don't forget your real life.

333
00:22:46,180 --> 00:22:46,260
[SPEAKER_02]: What?

334
00:22:46,505 --> 00:22:51,368
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, I think, to be fair, I think EverQuest 2 does have some type of disclaimer.

335
00:22:51,789 --> 00:22:58,813
[SPEAKER_04]: And this could just as easily be built into any... I mean, it's just EverQuest kind of gets that bad rap to begin with.

336
00:22:59,794 --> 00:23:01,835
[SPEAKER_04]: But this is something that they could have honestly built into anything.

337
00:23:01,855 --> 00:23:02,236
[SPEAKER_02]: EverCrack.

338
00:23:02,796 --> 00:23:03,296
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, exactly.

339
00:23:03,316 --> 00:23:04,237
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it's EverCrack with pizza.

340
00:23:06,418 --> 00:23:08,040
[SPEAKER_04]: Could I get my pizza with crack on it?

341
00:23:09,481 --> 00:23:10,281
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki, any thoughts?

342
00:23:10,321 --> 00:23:11,862
[SPEAKER_04]: Was this something you'd use, probably?

343
00:23:13,683 --> 00:23:14,444
[SPEAKER_03]: Only because...

344
00:23:15,387 --> 00:23:17,249
[SPEAKER_03]: It's Pizza Hut.

345
00:23:17,549 --> 00:23:20,512
[SPEAKER_03]: I would not be using it, only because we don't have any locally.

346
00:23:21,092 --> 00:23:24,115
[SPEAKER_03]: So they would be of no use to me.

347
00:23:24,635 --> 00:23:27,778
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, hypothetically, if there was a Pizza Hut a mile away.

348
00:23:28,359 --> 00:23:29,700
[SPEAKER_03]: Hell yeah, I love Pizza Hut.

349
00:23:30,220 --> 00:23:36,546
[SPEAKER_03]: But I don't like online ordering, because honestly, I've worked at a pizza place.

350
00:23:37,287 --> 00:23:38,548
[SPEAKER_03]: I know how dumb they are.

351
00:23:39,147 --> 00:23:42,249
[SPEAKER_03]: There's no way that they can do online ordering very well.

352
00:23:43,290 --> 00:23:44,971
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, they've gotta mess that shit up.

353
00:23:45,132 --> 00:23:54,098
[SPEAKER_03]: So, and really, I mean, I have a portable phone right next to my computer, I just pick that sucker up and I can order a pizza while playing a game at the same time.

354
00:23:54,178 --> 00:24:03,225
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, you can do it over the phone probably a lot quicker too, and it wouldn't interrupt your gameplay as would a, you know, giant window over your screen.

355
00:24:03,506 --> 00:24:06,768
[SPEAKER_02]: Then they can repeat back your order to you to make sure they got it right.

356
00:24:06,788 --> 00:24:07,288
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly.

357
00:24:07,328 --> 00:24:07,949
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly.

358
00:24:09,571 --> 00:24:10,932
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, to be continued.

359
00:24:11,292 --> 00:24:13,153
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you guys think that this will be a trend?

360
00:24:13,793 --> 00:24:16,775
[SPEAKER_04]: Seeing these more commercial sell-out integrations into these games?

361
00:24:17,075 --> 00:24:22,958
[SPEAKER_04]: As somebody joked during the three-hour show, it's just a matter of time before you can buy the pizza with gil, or gold, or whatever the in-game currency is.

362
00:24:23,818 --> 00:24:24,499
[SPEAKER_02]: Sadly, yes.

363
00:24:26,180 --> 00:24:35,405
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm sure it's just a matter of time before we start seeing more of these types of commercial integrations into our favorite online RPGs, because we spend so much time in them.

364
00:24:37,446 --> 00:24:37,786
[SPEAKER_02]: Addicts!

365
00:24:39,577 --> 00:24:42,078
[SPEAKER_04]: And on that note, that's going to do it for tonight's podcast.

366
00:24:42,118 --> 00:24:44,079
