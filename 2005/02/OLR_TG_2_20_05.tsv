459	3962	Orange Lounge Radio To Go Edition, week of February 21st, 2005.
4562	15770	And now, the Orange Lounge Radio To Go Edition, your internet radio home for discussion on rhythm and music gaming and all the news on video games that don't suck.
16190	20533	And now, here are your hosts, DarkSakura, Sky, and Loki.
21734	23075	Hello, everybody.
23515	28739	One more time, thanks a bunch for tuning in to subscribing, downloading, whatever it did.
29502	30162	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
52466	54308	I'm feeling kind of crappy tonight
75020	78421	Let's get into video game news that doesn't suck.
78501	80522	Well, maybe it's some sucky news, but we'll see.
81342	83043	DarkSakura, what have you been playing this week?
83063	83663	What have you been into?
84103	85664	I guess I should say, what have you been playing for the past two weeks?
85684	87484	I've been playing Spill the Seven Up on my arm.
88565	89525	Wow, what a fun game!
89625	90525	Only $49.95 from Nintendo.
90725	92886	Is that the sequel to Cool Spot?
94507	95567	I've been playing Silent Hill 3.
96538	96678	Oh.
97039	98279	I need to go clean my arm.
98299	98940	We'll come back to me.
99200	100021	Okay, sounds good.
100081	101241	We'll go over to Loki.
101281	102342	What have you been playing this week?
102662	105004	I've been playing My Computer's Broken.
105564	106165	What happened?
107085	109087	I think the power supply went out.
109807	115151	All I know is the power supply was very fucking hot, and I shut off the computer.
115171	119193	Well, I was running through town as my mule in Final Fantasy XI.
119234	119534	I was like...
120661	120801	Off.
121142	125405	Did your computer finally just decide to tell you, look buddy, you play too much of this damn game.
125525	126165	You need a break.
126566	130829	No, I think it's the power supply because it was really, really hot.
130929	134892	I mean, I was touching the case and the case was actually burning my fingers.
135052	139175	I mean, that's not usually a good sign if that's happening.
139675	141537	And I think the power supply is just shot.
141957	143578	Could be all the dust that was in there.
144279	148702	It might have stopped the fan and then the power supply overheated and just died.
149282	151644	So I got Binding Power Supply and that sucks.
152084	156867	Before that, I was playing Final Fantasy XI, a little bit of Matrix Online.
158007	162450	And when I say a little bit of Matrix Online, I cannot stress how little I've been playing.
162710	167233	I played through the tutorial again and got bored with it again.
167533	170154	And then, what else did I do?
172543	199118	I was playing this stupid game that was like it was another freeware game where you launch gnomes into the air and you like see how far you can get them to fly and I don't know that was amusing for about five minutes and then uh that's about all I've been playing I'm gonna actually start getting into some more console games this week since my computer's down so now heaven forbid yeah you might have to play some console games this week what are you gonna do
200290	216727	Well, I'm hopefully going to get my Grand Theft Auto San Andreas back because I want to play that, but if not, I guess, Shudder, I guess I could start and play through, maybe, with cheating, of course, because I can't play these games legitimately.
217027	218108	Final Fantasy X2.
218709	219369	Oh my gosh.
220270	220631	Ten.
221692	222052	Whatever.
223354	223734	All right.
225031	230213	This was a big issue a while back on the three-hour program that we do over at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.
230553	232193	We actually wrote Squeenix.
232273	235094	We wrote them an email and said, you need to tell us how this is pronounced.
235174	236874	Is it X2 or 10-2?
237214	240135	Because this is a huge argument between Jamie and our chat room.
240395	241616	And it turns out Jamie was right.
241636	242696	I'm always right.
243376	244136	It's 10-2.
245197	246277	It's so silly, though.
246317	246817	It's 10-2.
246897	248638	But, I mean, it makes sense at the same time.
248658	250158	Do you call this Final Fantasy X-I?
251158	251739	and Super Punch-Out! !
267734	268894	Right on, Super Punch-Out!
269315	269875	Hey, you know what?
269895	270555	Super Punch-Out!
270795	273696	If I remember right, it kind of came out towards the end of the Super Nintendo.
273996	275696	It was kind of overlooked, it feels like.
275716	276837	It was in the high day.
277337	280058	It seems like not a lot of people knew about Super Punch-Out!
280138	281918	Everybody knew Mike Tyson's Punch-Out!
282338	284119	Not a lot of people were in there.
284239	285159	Maybe it was just my neck of the woods.
285579	285839	Gradius 3?
286419	286800	Good choice.
287460	291701	Which is like the only version I think that Dan and I could beat.
292121	293161	The Super Nintendo one.
293361	294722	What possessed you to get into Silent Hill 3?
295925	296665	As opposed to four.
296845	297926	Oh, okay.
298866	300727	Actually, the Xbox wasn't hooked up.
301927	302908	That was it.
303288	304648	It's as simple as that sometimes.
305069	305689	Yeah, that was it.
307910	310671	As for games I've been playing this week, WarioWare Touched.
310871	312651	I went out and got Tuesday the day it came out.
312751	316153	I love the WarioWare original on Game Boy Advance.
316773	322015	Wasn't such a fan of the one on Game Boy, or not Game Boy, GameCube, because...
322839	326940	The problem with it for me is it was just a rehashed version of the same thing I'd already played.
327320	340323	And not that it was necessarily a bad game per se, because the multiplayer stuff was hilarious, but I just got really annoyed that I fell into that Nintendo trap of buying the same thing, just a little bit better, a little newer.
340883	343144	So it made me mad, and I only played it a couple times.
343464	347184	But now, WarioWare Touched is out, and it's not a rehashed version.
347224	348025	It's got like 180 new games.
350091	350732	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
371377	372879	It's just so cool with the pen.
373199	378405	It's a little weird because they have microphone games mixed in now, and every microphone game is some type of blowing.
378445	381068	So it's like, draw, draw, draw, draw, draw, draw.
382450	390639	It's kind of WarioWare, but hey, if you like the original WarioWare, if you like Feel the Magic XXXY, very similar, you'll like WarioWare Touched.
391059	391760	I recommend it.
392759	394179	Yeah, the parrot minigame is very cool.
394200	398541	Because we couldn't get to work at first, but then we finally did, and that was the best.
399241	401042	Some of the unlocks are so weird.
401362	403543	Like, the original WarioWare had some awesome unlocks.
403563	412766	Like, it had Dr. Wario that you could get in it, and it had the little game you got with the little bird that would eat the things that fall down from the sky.
413426	416447	WarioWare Touch doesn't have quite the same cool unlocks.
416487	418388	Like, you can unlock a calculator.
419408	421609	You can unlock a fortune teller.
422540	424542	You can unlock a yo-yo.
425623	427524	What was the gelatin thing?
427544	430367	Yeah, one of the unlocks is a piece of jello.
431088	432129	It's the custard game.
432429	437533	And all you do is you poke it with your stylus and it goes boing, boing, boing when you poke it with the stylus.
437573	438154	That's all it is.
439175	439815	It's crazy.
440236	442798	But that's the kind of thing you come to expect from WarioWare, so it's all good.
443857	446058	Alright, let's get into some news that's going on this week.
446738	450460	Jamie was mentioning about Xbox, so this is certainly important to announce.
450820	462966	Check the date on the bottom of your Xbox to see when it was manufactured, because if it was pre-October 2003, specifically October 23rd, 2003, you're entitled to a power cord replacement.
463006	464887	Check out Xbox.com for the details.
465267	472371	But apparently, the old power cord was causing some Xboxes to overheat and possibly catch fire.
473607	473987	Careful.
474848	478970	So we checked the date on mine, and luckily it was in 2004.
480090	483012	So I'm okay, which is good because I'm lazy, and I probably would have never filed a claim.
483092	487174	I might need to replace you for the orange box because... Oh, wait.
489715	491276	So check it out.
491316	492557	You may be eligible for this.
492697	494097	Xbox.com for more information.
494578	500881	Since you guys love to talk about Final Fantasy XI, and hey, I do too, it's only natural that we mention this about Final Fantasy XII.
502079	504301	Final Fantasy XII Final Fantasy XII Final Fantasy XII Final Fantasy XII
531834	532434	Squenix, Squenix
557677	561918	This is an exciting story for those of you guys that are fans of Mario Kart.
562158	564639	They're making an arcade version of Mario Kart.
564939	565879	Don't get too excited.
565939	577342	It's only announced for Japanese arcades right now, but then again, F-Zero AX was only supposed to be in Japanese arcades at first, and it did end up coming to America, albeit very limited release because the machines were very expensive.
577882	580403	But Mario Kart is coming to Japanese arcades.
580463	581603	Here's the weird thing, though.
582283	585744	It's using the Triforce system, which is Nintendo...
586545	597589	Namco, and Sega now they haven't said anything about what Sega's involvement is with this game necessarily but Namco sure as heck is involved because Ms.
597629	613154	Pac-Man and Pac-Man and Blinky are all going to have their own karts so you can race Mario vs. Pac-Man and we were kind of talking about this earlier on the 3 hour show what if you could play as Sonic or some of the Sega characters I still hope that Sonic doesn't get a car
613891	615492	Yes, Sonic would just run alongside him.
615753	616633	They also need Mappy.
617714	618575	That would be cool.
618635	619576	Mappy from Namco.
620016	621958	And Knights needs to be in it, but Knights needs to fly.
622038	623960	And the dude from Katamari Damashii, the prince.
624700	626102	Yeah, he needs to roll to Katamari.
626882	629665	You know they're going to have all these inside jokes in the background and stuff.
629965	630826	Anyway, that's very exciting.
630846	632507	It's going to use the card system as well.
632707	635570	You know the initial D and F-Zero AX had?
635830	637832	The little magnetic card that you can use in the game?
638484	639584	This is going to have that as well.
640004	641285	So very exciting news.
641685	645306	Keep your fingers crossed that this stuff comes over to America because I bet it'll be a big hit.
645706	650247	Even though, I don't know if it's just me, but arcades are just not as cool as they used to be.
650707	652627	It's a bunch of ticket eaters now.
653507	653967	You know what?
654067	657608	They need to make another game like Starblade was with the giant rotating machine.
659369	659689	Cool.
660549	661009	They need to.
661727	668392	Something else for me to... If I'm going to pay 75 cents or a dollar a game, I want the machine to move with me in it.
669253	670474	How about just another Dragon's Lair?
670954	671695	Those games are cool.
671775	672836	We do need another game like that.
672856	675918	How about an arcade version of Katamari Damacy with a trackball?
677480	678100	That'd be cool.
678801	679922	A giant trackball.
680262	680562	Yes.
682243	685826	Here's a game that's been out in arcades recently, and it's coming to the console very soon.
685906	688348	Tekken 5 is coming out February 25th.
689875	693678	It's the first game that's been released since, of course, Tekken 4 in the Tekken series.
693958	697421	But that was back in 2002, so this is the first one we've had in a while.
697961	699002	It's going to sell for $49.99.
699543	714314	Of course, there's going to be a premium set that comes with a special controller designed specifically for Tekken 5 and a Tekken-themed 6-disc DVD case, $99.99 if you want that.
719528	726290	PlayStation 2, February 25th I know you were a big Tekken girl, DarkSakura I love Tekken Any thoughts on Tekken 5?
726490	742553	I'm so happy, and then once the game comes out, I get the poster at Dan's GameStop You just want the free stuff Dude, it's coming with the first three Alright So how can you go wrong with that, having arcade-perfect versions at home?
743616	748697	instead of having to use our the main cabinet.
749797	751597	How does the Tekken 5 cards work?
751877	759959	I mean, this may sound like such a dumb question, but I never really got into the Tekken games, especially in the arcades, because the people in the arcades are scary good, and I cannot waste money playing them.
759999	762179	They will school me 11 ways from Tuesday.
763099	769400	You can put it, you buy the card, and you choose a character, and you raise your character on that card.
770041	772721	You can actually accessorize them, get them like hats and
773442	775463	So it's Barbie Tekken.
776704	777084	Sort of.
777624	781427	But you also save your improvements that you make with the character too.
782527	782787	Alright.
784268	794354	Speaking of improvements, Orange Lounge Radio To Go is here to better your life and what way to do it better than DarkSakura and her advice column.
794634	798236	Her piece of advice for the week to help make your life a little bit better.
808253	815737	Today's advice is how to fool a lie detector test, which everyone needs to know in case you're ever arrested.
817318	824482	Number one, examiners will administer a pre-test before the actual polygraph to create a baseline of reactions.
825203	828865	During the pretest, force yourself to breathe faster than normal and display confidence.
829366	830867	Never appear nervous or shy.
832168	835550	Number two, maintain eye contact with the examiner.
835650	836430	Do not fidget.
836811	838852	Do not, however, sit completely still.
839372	841173	Move something subtly but regularly.
841273	843115	Your toes, your fingers, hips, etc.
843855	847798	Number three, do not try to anticipate the questions you will be asked.
848238	850159	Think positive and relaxing thoughts.
850900	852801	And the last one, number four, when answering questions,
855904	859287	When answering control questions truthfully, bite your tongue slightly.
860568	862209	This hopefully will give a false reading.
862750	871658	Examiners may find it impossible to decipher your test because the readings are inconsistent, as in they show stress both when you're answering truthfully and when you could be lying.
872939	874760	A little bit of trivia about the polygraph.
876081	876642	Interesting.
876702	879965	The guy who created the polygraph is also the creator of Wonder Woman.
880928	881468	No way.
881849	886392	And her golden lasso is a tribute to the lie detector.
887752	888093	Wow.
888513	889694	You learn something new every day.
889934	890154	Yep.
890234	891635	This program being no exception.
892075	892475	Interesting.
892575	894877	He was also into bondage and SNM.
896098	897178	Thanks for sharing.
898579	901061	You know, that explains a lot about Wonder Woman.
901121	902122	It really, really does.
902682	902862	Yep.
903502	903703	Wow.
906977	920780	This is interesting because apparently what's going on right now is there's a new bill going around the California legislation right now where they are trying to pass a new bill that will limit the sales of M-rated games to minors.
920840	926261	In other words, it's going to make it illegal to sell M-rated games to minors.
926301	927221	What do you guys think about this?
927921	933322	The games are intended for people over the age of 17 anyway, so I don't see why that's a problem.
933762	936263	Is this an excuse for lazy parenting though?
937093	937394	Yes.
939257	942022	As I always say, parents need to do their job.
942723	944927	Don't rely on the government to do your job for you.
946070	947713	I'm okay with this law and all.
947793	949917	I don't think it's such a bad thing, but I think...
950620	953462	It's kind of an excuse, in a way, you know?
953842	955643	Why aren't the parents being more involved?
955663	956764	The parents should know what games.
956804	958345	Who's giving the money to the kids?
958806	961567	Because if you're under 17, chances are you don't have a job.
961607	962848	Maybe you do, maybe you do.
963188	967611	And if that's the case, you're probably also old enough to know what games are good for you and what games aren't.
968092	973075	So, my question is, if the parents are giving the kids the money, shouldn't the parents know where the money's going?
973816	974256	I don't get it.
976057	978118	But, I'm okay with the bill.
978399	978839	I mean, whatever.
978859	979019	Whatever.
979923	983586	If you have any feedback, you can email us togo at orange lounge radio dot com.
983666	987709	Anything that has to do with what you hear on the Orange Lounge Radio to go edition.
988090	992954	Again, that's to go to go at orange lounge radio dot com.
993034	994235	Think of Togo and Slana.
994675	994975	Exactly.
994995	995736	And then think of us.
996597	996997	Exactly.
998898	999319	Some other.
999958	1002281	Interesting announcements going on this week.
1002401	1006385	Midway sent out a press release that they are reviving the Gauntlet series.
1006746	1009949	They're going to be releasing a game called Gauntlet Seven Sorrows.
1010109	1011551	Need game badly.
1011691	1021322	Blending an intuitive combat system, accessible role-playing game elements, and new junction skills, Seven Sorrows features the dynamic co-op it's known for, and for the first time ever,
1021792	1024534	It is online, supporting up to four players.
1024954	1025995	Hmm, so that's pretty cool.
1026655	1037302	Seven Sorrows is the fusion of fantasy fighting action with a strategy of user-friendly RPG elements, providing gamers a deep, engaging gameplay experience, complete with solo play, co-op, and an online community.
1037362	1043907	The new fighting system allows for easy pick-up and play, while simultaneously offering deeper choices for more advanced players.
1044387	1049070	Additionally, online role-playing game and collection elements add significant replay value to the game.
1049110	1050491	That all coming from their press release.
1050831	1077442	remember don't shoot the food so basically this sounds like Gauntlet Legacy except you know now it's going to be online and I gotta admit I wasn't all into Gauntlet Legacy I mean it was it was okay it was kind of Diablo to me but the original was just so good and then this new one comes along and I don't know it just seems repetitive granted the old one wasn't
1078567	1081089	I don't know, repetitive seemed to be okay back then.
1081149	1082270	I don't know how to explain it.
1082651	1086654	But Gauntlet, the original, didn't feel quite as repetitive as Legacy did.
1086694	1087535	But maybe it's just me.
1087615	1089196	Maybe I didn't give the game a fair enough chance.
1089337	1089717	Any thoughts?
1091258	1093340	You know, I tried to get into it.
1093380	1095562	We played it at home a bit on the N64.
1096503	1097063	But, eh.
1098545	1099866	I wasn't even into the old Gauntlet.
1100366	1101347	I had it on Dreamcast.
1102388	1104590	I wasn't even into the old Gauntlet at all.
1104963	1106424	I liked Gauntlet 2 on NES.
1106584	1107145	That was my favorite.
1107445	1108465	Loki, any thoughts on Gauntlet?
1109026	1111708	I like Gauntlet Legends because I was always Pojo.
1113969	1115070	Pojo all the time.
1115110	1116571	I was a giant chicken walking around.
1117892	1118652	Shooting fire.
1119273	1120274	Was that like a code or something?
1120294	1120774	I never knew about that.
1120794	1121414	Yeah, there was a code.
1121434	1123015	You could be Pojo the entire time.
1123596	1129420	And that was... I think it was egg and then 911 was the password.
1129960	1130400	Oh boy.
1130421	1132002	Interesting.
1132042	1132502	Interesting.
1133957	1134938	Midway Arcade Treasures 3
1154875	1159238	Now they're going to do a 3, but I'm a little weirded out by 3 because this is the deal with 3.
1160159	1166123	It's only going to be, it's not going to be 20 games, it's only going to be 8 games because there's somewhat newer games in here.
1166563	1169225	And here's the other weird thing, they're all racing games.
1170480	1182209	Badlands, Hydro Thunder, Offroad Thunder, Race Drivin', San Francisco Rush, San Francisco Rush 2049, Stun Runner, Super Offroad, and the bonus Trax Pack.
1182509	1183109	That sounds cool.
1183129	1185751	That'd be best if it was multi-tap or something.
1186091	1187512	Hydro Thunder was pretty cool.
1187733	1189133	Offroad Thunder was awesome.
1189454	1191015	That game was pretty sweet.
1191395	1196138	And San Francisco Rush and Rush 2049, those are pretty sweet.
1196339	1198320	They didn't say Arctic Thunder, did it?
1198680	1199121	It did not.
1199661	1199721	Ah.
1200202	1229951	but it's all about Hydro Thunder because Dan and I on Dreamcast we played Hydro Thunder like crazy and I used to go play it at the arcade all the time now see that's the thing that weirds me out about this is that I'm cool with all these games they are great games but for me they're great games in the arcade there's so much of a difference between like actually sitting in the big Hydro Thunder cabinet and changing the gears and racing and that and having the force feedback and everything there's such a difference between that and the console experience to me it's just not the same I don't know is it just me
1234045	1237298	it's a matter of opinion I guess, maybe
1238266	1239928	This will certainly be worth checking out.
1240048	1251437	I enjoy Treasures 1 and 2 so much, but I think it's one of those things, to me, this strikes me as something that Midway is just trying to continue to cash in on this Treasure success, but they've released all their games now.
1251457	1260644	Hopefully their port of San Francisco Rush will be better than the PlayStation or the Nintendo 64 versions of that game.
1260664	1263566	Well, these should be, hypothetically, arcade-perfect ports.
1263686	1265308	They should be just arcade-emulated ports.
1266188	1266769	Hypothetically.
1268288	1274930	Well damn, I want to see my copy of Offroad Thunder then for MAME because I want to download that shit.
1275791	1276811	Of course, of course.
1277851	1279872	Alright, moving on in video game news.
1280092	1285194	I thought this was way, and I think this is a good one for us to close on tonight.
1285234	1288335	This story was just far too interesting and shocking.
1288375	1292256	We did bring it up on the three hour show, but we gotta mention it here.
1293037	1297138	They're gonna be incorporating a new slash command into
1297952	1298873	EverQuest 2.
1298973	1300413	Yes, the MMORPG EverQuest 2.
1300574	1307077	And when I say slash command, I mean like, you know, sometimes you get hit slash attack to attack something, slash say or slash shout.
1307758	1310799	Well, now they're going to be putting in a new command called slash pizza.
1311920	1322366	And when you type slash pizza, it will bring up a Pizza Hut ordering window and you can order Pizza Hut express delivered to your door so you have another excuse to
1322842	1332667	Never to get up from your chair except to go to the bathroom As if people playing EverQuest needed more excuses What slash commands are going to come next?
1332827	1333628	Slash beer?
1334248	1338350	Slash orgy Slash prostitute for blowjob?
1338410	1338890	I mean, what?
1342332	1349156	It's just, I understand why they're doing it Although it's got to be a little bit insulting in a way, too
1350606	1353349	Here, you guys are too lazy to get up and use the phone.
1355530	1357412	We wouldn't want to take you away from your questing.
1357612	1359054	They're facilitating the addictions.
1359214	1359854	And you know what?
1359974	1366160	I don't think that Final Fantasy XI would ever get something like that one because they have the little disclaimer, you know, don't forget your real life.
1366180	1366260	What?
1366505	1371368	Now, I think, to be fair, I think EverQuest 2 does have some type of disclaimer.
1371789	1378813	And this could just as easily be built into any... I mean, it's just EverQuest kind of gets that bad rap to begin with.
1379794	1381835	But this is something that they could have honestly built into anything.
1381855	1382236	EverCrack.
1382796	1383296	Yeah, exactly.
1383316	1384237	No, it's EverCrack with pizza.
1386418	1388040	Could I get my pizza with crack on it?
1389481	1390281	Loki, any thoughts?
1390321	1391862	Was this something you'd use, probably?
1393683	1394444	Only because...
1395387	1397249	It's Pizza Hut.
1397549	1400512	I would not be using it, only because we don't have any locally.
1401092	1404115	So they would be of no use to me.
1404635	1407778	Okay, hypothetically, if there was a Pizza Hut a mile away.
1408359	1409700	Hell yeah, I love Pizza Hut.
1410220	1416546	But I don't like online ordering, because honestly, I've worked at a pizza place.
1417287	1418548	I know how dumb they are.
1419147	1422249	There's no way that they can do online ordering very well.
1423290	1424971	I mean, they've gotta mess that shit up.
1425132	1434098	So, and really, I mean, I have a portable phone right next to my computer, I just pick that sucker up and I can order a pizza while playing a game at the same time.
1434178	1443225	I mean, you can do it over the phone probably a lot quicker too, and it wouldn't interrupt your gameplay as would a, you know, giant window over your screen.
1443506	1446768	Then they can repeat back your order to you to make sure they got it right.
1446788	1447288	Exactly.
1447328	1447949	Exactly.
1449571	1450932	Alright, to be continued.
1451292	1453153	Do you guys think that this will be a trend?
1453793	1456775	Seeing these more commercial sell-out integrations into these games?
1457075	1462958	As somebody joked during the three-hour show, it's just a matter of time before you can buy the pizza with gil, or gold, or whatever the in-game currency is.
1463818	1464499	Sadly, yes.
1466180	1475405	And I'm sure it's just a matter of time before we start seeing more of these types of commercial integrations into our favorite online RPGs, because we spend so much time in them.
1477446	1477786	Addicts!
1479577	1482078	And on that note, that's going to do it for tonight's podcast.
