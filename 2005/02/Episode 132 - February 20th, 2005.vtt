01:30.000 --> 01:32.000
You

02:00.000 --> 02:08.000
Thunder, rain and lightning, danger of water rising

02:08.000 --> 02:14.000
Lammasight, wailing in the train's last line

02:14.000 --> 02:20.000
The shadows of dark creatures, steel clouds floating in the air

02:20.000 --> 02:23.000
People lost their shelter

02:23.000 --> 02:26.000
What's gonna happen to us?

02:26.000 --> 02:32.000
All the steps we take, all the moves we make, all the pain and pain

02:32.000 --> 02:35.000
I see the chaos through everyone

02:35.000 --> 02:38.000
Who are we? What can we do?

02:38.000 --> 02:40.000
Doing all the same

02:40.000 --> 02:41.000
You ain't it?

02:41.000 --> 02:44.000
We have our own style that we won't change

02:44.000 --> 02:47.000
You're the man with the evil in life now

02:47.000 --> 02:52.000
There is no way I could lose

02:52.000 --> 02:56.000
Can't hold on much longer

02:56.000 --> 02:59.000
I will never let go

02:59.000 --> 03:02.000
I know it's a one way track

03:02.000 --> 03:05.000
Tell me now how long this will last

03:05.000 --> 03:08.000
I'm not gonna think this way

03:08.000 --> 03:11.000
Or will I count on others

03:11.000 --> 03:14.000
Close my eyes and feel it burn

03:14.000 --> 03:17.000
Now I see what I'm gonna do

03:17.000 --> 03:21.000
Open your heart, it's gonna be alright

03:26.000 --> 03:29.000
Ancient city blazing

03:29.000 --> 03:32.000
Shadows keep attacking

03:32.000 --> 03:35.000
Little children crying

03:35.000 --> 03:38.000
Confusion, hopeless anger

03:38.000 --> 03:44.000
I don't know what it could be, but you drive me crazy

03:44.000 --> 03:47.000
All your cunning tricks make me sick

03:47.000 --> 03:52.000
You won't pound it your own way

03:52.000 --> 03:55.000
Can't hold on much longer

03:55.000 --> 03:58.000
But I will never let go

03:58.000 --> 04:01.000
I know it's a one-way track

04:01.000 --> 04:04.000
Tell me now how long this will last

04:04.000 --> 04:07.000
I'm not gonna think this way

04:07.000 --> 04:10.000
Or will I count on others

04:10.000 --> 04:13.000
Close my eyes and feel the burn

04:13.000 --> 04:16.000
Now I see what I've got to do

04:16.000 --> 04:22.500
Open your heart and you will see

04:46.000 --> 04:59.000
If it won't stop, there will be no future for us

04:59.000 --> 05:07.000
It's all said and done, but all the hate got set free

05:07.000 --> 05:13.000
I know it's a one way track, tell me now how long this will last

05:13.000 --> 05:17.000
Close my eyes and feel the burn

05:17.000 --> 05:19.000
Now I see what I gotta do

05:19.000 --> 05:22.000
Gotta open your heart too

05:22.000 --> 05:25.000
Can't hold on much longer

05:25.000 --> 05:28.000
I will never let go

05:28.000 --> 05:31.000
I know it's a one way track

05:31.000 --> 05:34.000
Tell me now how long this will last

05:34.000 --> 05:37.000
I'm not gonna think this way

05:37.000 --> 05:40.000
Or will I count on others

05:40.000 --> 05:43.000
Close my eyes and feel the burn

05:43.000 --> 05:46.000
Now I see what I'm gonna do

05:46.000 --> 05:52.400
Open your heart, it's gonna be all right, yeah!

Wow, your mic is loud today!

09:09.220 --> 09:11.220
That's... yeah, that's too loud for me.

09:11.220 --> 09:16.220
That's a first! Dang, I wonder if we had to turn it up last week, because somebody else was there last week, so...

09:16.220 --> 09:20.220
I don't see how... I hate something echoey.

09:20.220 --> 09:23.220
Yeah, that is kind of weird. I wonder what's going on with that. We'll, uh, change that.

09:23.220 --> 09:25.220
La la la la la la la.

09:25.220 --> 09:29.220
That's weird. Okay, well, yeah, that is kind of weird. She sounds echoey.

09:29.220 --> 09:32.220
Turn down her gain a little bit. I think it's just her gain's up.

09:44.220 --> 09:50.220
Hi, I'm fixing stuff. I can't tell what the microphone is.

09:50.220 --> 09:55.220
In beautiful Orange Launch fashion. Can't tell which wire is which in this place.

09:55.220 --> 09:57.220

10:27.000 --> 10:28.160

I just gave something to Rob, and all of a sudden he goes, ooh! And I just completely lost my train of thought. Wonderful!

10:35.680 --> 10:39.580
DDR Angel knows how to kiss some ass around here. She's brought me a bunch of Pepsi

10:39.580 --> 10:43.200
bottle caps that have the iTunes songs on them, because she knows I'm like one of the

10:43.200 --> 10:47.280
only people that actually uses iTunes, and actually purchases songs legally through

10:47.280 --> 10:49.560
iTunes. So she's giving me

10:49.560 --> 10:50.560
Free songs!

10:50.560 --> 10:52.280
I'm so excited.

10:52.280 --> 10:55.220
And then she's also brought me candy.

10:55.220 --> 10:57.120
That is the best way to my heart.

10:57.120 --> 10:58.120
Music and candy.

10:58.120 --> 10:59.120
I have meat and caffeine.

10:59.120 --> 11:01.840
Well, that works for you.

11:01.840 --> 11:04.080
Meat and caffeine.

11:04.080 --> 11:05.720
And I'm music and candy.

11:05.720 --> 11:08.200
What would Loki be?

11:08.200 --> 11:09.200
Blood guts.

11:09.200 --> 11:10.200
Maybe.

11:10.200 --> 11:12.000
And porn.

11:12.000 --> 11:13.720
And cooking, because that's what he's doing right now.

11:13.720 --> 11:16.040
In fact, he's got our webcam in the kitchen.

11:16.040 --> 11:18.040
What the hell?

11:18.040 --> 11:25.040
orangelawnsradio.com

11:48.040 --> 11:52.200
figured what the hell I'll bring another old-school game next weekend to

11:52.200 --> 11:56.400
showcase you know that'll work I'll bring like the SNES and play punch-out

11:56.400 --> 12:02.400
awesome actually we broke out the ps1 today because we found that Dan's been

12:02.400 --> 12:07.280
playing tempest X all day that's awesome as in the kind of crappy version of

12:07.280 --> 12:13.320
tempest 2000 tempest is tempest my friend although tempest 2000 on the jack

12:13.320 --> 12:20.520
was the best. Not on the Saturn. Tempest on the Jag was the only game worth getting a

12:20.520 --> 12:28.120
Jag for. What about Defender 2000? Blah. No there was another, it was Alien vs. Predator.

12:28.120 --> 12:33.680
I guess so, I guess so. That's about the only Alien vs. Predator thing worth even remotely

12:33.680 --> 12:39.560
wasting your time with. The arcade game? Any arcade game, but not the movie. That was my

12:39.560 --> 12:45.320
point not the movie anyway yeah we're here for the next three hours you know

12:45.320 --> 12:50.600

12:50.600 --> 12:55.240
favorite segments cage match and maybe some Bahmani news too and if we've run

12:55.240 --> 12:57.960
out of Bahmani stuff I guess we'll talk about other video game stuff because

12:57.960 --> 13:05.560
we're dorks we're gonna start off this break with a potpourri of Bahmani music

13:05.560 --> 13:08.240
there is no theme this break we're just gonna play whatever the hell we want

13:08.240 --> 13:11.840
And we'll start it off with a song I want to hear, Shiny Disco Balls.

13:11.840 --> 13:14.760
We'll be back after this with more Orange Launch Radio, episode 132.

17:54.760 --> 17:59.760
music

17:59.760 --> 18:04.760
music

18:04.760 --> 18:09.760
music

19:09.760 --> 19:13.760
Just like a fool, I'm in the dark side

19:13.760 --> 19:16.760
Got a full staff, and I'm fighting myself now

19:16.760 --> 19:19.760
I'm in the dark side

19:19.760 --> 19:24.760
Not do it, not do it, not do it

19:24.760 --> 19:31.760
Not do it, not do it, not do it

19:31.760 --> 19:33.760
Fool, I'm in the dark side

20:03.760 --> 20:13.120
Listen to Orange Lounge Radio, because Bongo demands it!

20:13.120 --> 20:15.760
We are back here with more Orange Lounge Radio.

20:15.760 --> 20:21.640
Hello boys and girls on this happy 220-2005.

20:21.640 --> 20:23.920
That's a lot of twos and a lot of zeros.

20:23.920 --> 20:24.920
Yeah.

20:24.920 --> 20:26.800
Uh, I don't know.

20:26.800 --> 20:28.120
I'm out of clever things to say.

20:28.120 --> 20:29.600
There's a lot of zeros in the world.

20:29.600 --> 20:31.360
Oh, you're not so echoey anymore.

20:31.360 --> 20:32.360
Your echo went away.

20:32.360 --> 20:33.360
Yeah, but I'm still sniffy.

20:33.360 --> 20:41.120
I know there's been like disease going around. No, it's called someone decided to clean the upstairs room while I was in it. Okay

20:41.640 --> 20:47.640
Yeah, and there was like a thick layer of dust. Yeah, it's pretty bad. All right. Well, you know it needed doing

20:47.640 --> 20:51.400
I'm just was upset at the time. I'm a scared of moving out of this place

20:51.400 --> 20:54.240
You know, the orange launch radio is studio is moving in April

20:54.840 --> 20:58.620
So hopefully you'll have less of a drive to get to the orange launch studio Jamie

20:58.620 --> 21:04.200
me. Hopefully. Because the Orange Laundry Studios are moving and I fear what this place

21:04.200 --> 21:09.180
is going to look like when we move everything. Probably going to find God knows what behind

21:09.180 --> 21:15.540
all this stuff, but that's part of the joy in moving is finding these rare treasures.

21:15.540 --> 21:20.620
You're looking very studio-like today with your headphones on. Am I? Thank you. It's

21:20.620 --> 21:23.620
too bad they can't see it on the webcam, but that's alright. We don't need the webcam.

21:23.620 --> 21:26.620
What's with the headphones today? Actually, I usually wear these headphones. You probably

21:26.620 --> 21:30.260
can't notice it because my hair is usually bigger and so it kind of hides

21:30.260 --> 21:33.220
the headphones because my hair is so huge but since I got a haircut you can't

21:33.220 --> 21:37.580
see the headphones so well. That's right you weren't here last week because I got

21:37.580 --> 21:42.500
my hair cut just before last week's show. So speaking of last week we'll start off

21:42.500 --> 21:46.100
tonight's show by asking how was your week how was your day Dark Sacra? I don't

21:46.100 --> 21:50.860
even remember what I did last weekend. I know I had to do something. Oh yeah it

21:50.860 --> 21:58.780
it was celebrating Valentine's Day. I'm so bad. Didn't you say the man was listening

21:58.780 --> 22:04.200
tonight too? Yeah, I am. Whoops! Whoops! Um, seriously though, we went to Claim Jumper

22:04.200 --> 22:09.860
for dinner, and ate like everything in sight, and I had chocolate cream cheese pie. I wish

22:09.860 --> 22:13.100
I was in a relationship so I could go to Claim Jumper. You could go to Claim Jumper anyway.

22:13.100 --> 22:17.980
I know, but maybe somebody else would pay for it. I could just put out and get it paid

22:17.980 --> 22:25.580
for it. Hold up a little piece of a box. We'll give special favors for Claim Jumper. Exactly.

22:25.580 --> 22:32.560
It's worth it, too. I'm not a whore. Claim Jumper's worth it. I got one of the favorite

22:32.560 --> 22:40.660
things, whatever they call it, and I had the potato cakes and everything, and I had, it's

22:40.660 --> 22:45.780
like a half a chicken, and I took the rest of the chicken home. I like the leg. I was

22:45.780 --> 22:52.480
and they gave me a free cup of soup. Dan got like, for his appetizer, he got like a chili

22:52.480 --> 22:57.360
in the bread bowl. And I'm sitting here with my little cup of soup going, huh, soup. I'm

22:57.360 --> 23:01.160
sitting there staring at his bowl and eating part of it and it's like, there's no point

23:01.160 --> 23:04.800
you should be sitting there staring at his food here, have another cup. I was like, thank

23:04.800 --> 23:05.960
you, you get a good sip.

23:05.960 --> 23:11.640
Aw, that's nice. Claim Jumper has the best potato cheddar soup in the world, in the world.

23:11.640 --> 23:16.840
It has pieces of, uh, of, uh, slightly overcooked, uh, potato skin in it.

23:16.840 --> 23:17.340
Yeah.

23:17.340 --> 23:18.140
Because it's crunchy.

23:18.140 --> 23:20.840
For those who don't know what claims number is, because they don't have it everywhere, I think they only have it-

23:20.840 --> 23:21.840
I think it's only in California.

23:21.840 --> 23:27.340
Well, I think there- it's in other states too, but mostly on the West Coast, I'm not sure, but I know they don't have it everywhere,

23:27.340 --> 23:35.140
but basically it's- it's this giant log cabin themed restaurant, but the portions are like, they kill the buffalo out back and put it on your plate.

23:35.140 --> 23:37.340
I mean, seriously. This is how big it is.

23:37.340 --> 23:43.340
I didn't really do anything too Bimani-related. I played some Silent Hill 3.

23:43.340 --> 23:49.340
Silent Hill 4 is sorta, eh, creepy. Just sort of annoying creepy.

23:49.340 --> 23:52.340
Silent Hill 3 starts off like, shit your pants creepy.

23:52.340 --> 23:57.340
I screamed like a girl at one part of Silent Hill 4. It's a different kind of scare, I think.

23:57.340 --> 24:03.340
Silent Hill 3, dude. I only got as far as the first part of it, the dream part.

24:03.340 --> 24:09.340
But it was like, you know what, the Uzi in that game is so ridiculously not useful.

24:09.340 --> 24:11.340
I was like, ooh, a handgun, shoot the dog.

24:11.340 --> 24:15.340
Well, that's always the weird thing about Silent Hill is you don't, you can't really kill things.

24:15.340 --> 24:21.340
I mean, you can, but it's more, and that's kind of what really bugged me about Silent Hill when I first played it, too,

24:21.340 --> 24:23.340
because it's such a different type of game.

24:23.340 --> 24:27.340
And it's like, you know, my instinct when I play a video game is to kill everything.

24:27.340 --> 24:29.340
But in Silent Hill, you don't have enough ammo to kill everything.

24:29.340 --> 24:32.780
to kill everything. You have to be all Metal Gear Solid about it and you have to sneak

24:32.780 --> 24:37.940
by zombies and just run like hell. But that is so not the way I usually play adventure

24:37.940 --> 24:41.820
games. I want to explore every little corner. I want to kill everything because it might

24:41.820 --> 24:44.820
drop something I need. But that's not the same mindset you can approach a downhill game.

24:44.820 --> 24:51.340
I wasn't spoiling shit. Stop saying I spoiled anything.

24:51.340 --> 24:53.220
Don't listen to that Sharon.

24:53.220 --> 24:57.420
Anyway, Dan bought me roses.

24:57.420 --> 25:00.620
I came home from work the other day, and they were roses.

25:00.620 --> 25:02.940
Wait, now I believe, and I could find this, too,

25:02.940 --> 25:04.220
in an earlier podcast.

25:04.220 --> 25:05.740
You said something to, I remember

25:05.740 --> 25:07.420
in one of the podcasts, you said,

25:07.420 --> 25:09.540
I don't need roses, not flowery girl shit.

25:09.540 --> 25:11.380
My man buys me Silent Hill.

25:11.380 --> 25:15.460
Well, I'm really not very girly girly

25:15.460 --> 25:16.740
when it comes to relationships.

25:16.740 --> 25:20.360
But every so often, I want something sweet.

25:20.360 --> 25:22.780
I have to have my dose of sugar in the relationship,

25:22.780 --> 25:28.420
else I start you know getting lethargic you know without something to keep my I

25:28.420 --> 25:33.420
guess relationship blood sugar up or something you can't use Splenda for that

25:33.420 --> 25:39.180
no Splenda so he came home and gave me this box it's really long box I'm

25:39.180 --> 25:43.380
thinking oh well it's got like a poster in it or something and there were

25:43.380 --> 25:51.860
there's a dozen pink roses in it oh I know I feel all spoiled and special you

25:51.860 --> 25:58.500
are spoiled that's all right thank you but if you weren't spoiled you wouldn't

25:58.500 --> 26:02.340
bring that same charm to the show I don't think now you would you'd be

26:02.340 --> 26:17.620
charming either way shut up Rob you can stop shutting up now okay hi hi but

26:17.620 --> 26:21.900
that's that's really it we've been going through the old system stuff I found

26:21.900 --> 26:27.340
Dan found my copy of cotton for the PC engine duo so I have this feeling that

26:27.340 --> 26:30.140
tomorrow I'm gonna be breaking out the turbo graphics and playing a lot of

26:30.140 --> 26:34.660
cotton which is it's they came out actually on the Neo Geo pocket color in

26:34.660 --> 26:38.580
the States I think but it's a game where you play as the little witch riding her

26:38.580 --> 26:44.780
broom and she's addicted this candy that makes her throw up called willow it's

26:44.780 --> 26:53.220
funny and then she goes WEE-LAW! So, anyway, I'm done. Yay. Alright, Angel, how was your

26:53.220 --> 27:01.140
week? How was your day? Monday was... Monday. Yeah. I got chocolate and stuff. Is that new?

27:01.140 --> 27:06.820
Yes, that's new. He's pointing at my neck. Angel's got a heart around her neck. It's

27:06.820 --> 27:12.140
a little gold heart. I wonder where that came from. Hee hee. Tee hee, tee hee. Yeah, Magus's

27:12.140 --> 27:14.140
fall alright it's all good

27:14.140 --> 27:16.420
um...

27:16.420 --> 27:19.460
geez I don't remember what really happened this week

27:19.460 --> 27:24.700
aside from that and then you know school and work and stuff and

27:24.700 --> 27:28.980
and Rob's looking at his caps and playing with them

27:28.980 --> 27:30.340
yeah actually

27:30.340 --> 27:33.100
yeah he's got a couple songs to get now yay

27:33.100 --> 27:34.580
and uh...

27:34.580 --> 27:37.700
by the way I drank way too much soda this week for that

27:37.700 --> 27:38.940
so like

27:38.940 --> 27:40.500
you know

27:40.500 --> 27:54.500
Contrary to popular belief, as much as I like people to do things for me, you don't have to drink all that Pepsi to win me free songs. Seriously, moderation, honey, it's okay. I'll just take what you have extra. It's all good.

27:54.500 --> 27:56.500
Who said it was all regular soda?

27:56.500 --> 28:01.500
Still, still. Water's good too. You can do the water once in a while.

28:01.500 --> 28:27.500
Of course. Anyway, um, god, not much went on really. I mean, I played some games but not much. Oh yeah, and then the internet went out, dammit. Two days later, um, two days later and some, uh, phone calls. We finally have internet back, so that's good. And, um, I don't know what else happened this week. It just went by way too quick.

28:27.500 --> 28:28.500
week.

28:28.500 --> 28:31.780
Alright, then I guess you're done.

28:31.780 --> 28:35.500
Well, Loki looks like he's cooking, so I guess I'll talk about my week.

28:35.500 --> 28:38.260
My Valentine's Day, now I'm the single bitch in here.

28:38.260 --> 28:39.260
Everybody else is in a relationship.

28:39.260 --> 28:40.260
I'm the single bitch.

28:40.260 --> 28:41.260
That's fine.

28:41.260 --> 28:42.260
I'm okay with that.

28:42.260 --> 28:43.260
Hey, hey.

28:43.260 --> 28:44.260
I said he's lollipops.

28:44.260 --> 28:45.260
Alright.

28:45.260 --> 28:52.660
You did, but for Valentine's Day, actually one of my buddies had a little cook-over thing.

28:52.660 --> 28:54.900
Like he cooked dinner for a bunch of single people.

28:54.900 --> 28:57.420
He had like a singles dinner, which I think is really nice.

28:57.420 --> 28:58.420
That's a very good idea.

28:58.420 --> 29:00.760
It was very nice and very sweet, so I was happy that he did that.

29:00.760 --> 29:05.320
So he gave me something to do on Valentine's Day where I didn't feel lonely.

29:05.320 --> 29:08.580
And I didn't even have to put out, and I didn't have to buy flowers for anybody.

29:08.580 --> 29:12.840
So it was great.

29:12.840 --> 29:15.700
So I got steak on Valentine's Day.

29:15.700 --> 29:16.700
How great is that?

29:16.700 --> 29:18.620
I got homemade steak on Valentine's Day.

29:18.620 --> 29:19.960
It's awesome.

29:19.960 --> 29:20.960
So...

29:20.960 --> 29:22.140
Because beef is love.

29:22.140 --> 29:25.080
Seriously, it is.

29:25.080 --> 29:28.040
I know you perverts, not that kind of meat, meat.

29:28.040 --> 29:29.040
Bastards.

29:29.040 --> 29:32.960
Let's see, what else did I do this week?

29:32.960 --> 29:37.400
I played a lot of WarioWare Touched, because I bought it on the DS on Tuesday, the day

29:37.400 --> 29:38.400
it came out.

29:38.400 --> 29:41.560
Because, you know, I was all excited for a new WarioWare game.

29:41.560 --> 29:45.860
And there was a side of me where I was kind of like, what if they do the Nintendo thing

29:45.860 --> 29:49.460
and just recycle the same garbage again, I have to play the same damn minigames.

29:49.460 --> 29:52.840
But they're all new and that made me so happy, so I'll gush about that more on this week's

29:52.840 --> 29:54.000
podcast.

29:54.000 --> 29:58.340
definitely check that out if you haven't yet. Orioware is awesome. I'm very happy

29:58.340 --> 30:03.380
with it. There are some downsides to it though, so I'll talk about it later. And then

30:03.380 --> 30:06.420
I was doing a little bit of retro gaming too as well. I've been playing a little

30:06.420 --> 30:08.700
more of the emulator. I don't know why I've been getting so back into that

30:08.700 --> 30:12.820
lately. I think it's because like I've been trying to spend a little more

30:12.820 --> 30:15.980
gaming time with things other than Final Fantasy 11, although I've been playing

30:15.980 --> 30:20.700
that a little bit too. I actually went on Xbox Live for the first time in like two

30:20.700 --> 30:23.780
months, and so I found these people that were adding me as friends, and they

30:23.780 --> 30:27.380
probably had wondered if I thought the face of the earth or what but I finally

30:27.380 --> 30:34.760
added him back so hi and I decided to play Halo 2 online and I got killed so

30:34.760 --> 30:39.600
so bad I came in last place and like seventh place which is next last place

30:39.600 --> 30:43.840
and like twice as many kills as I did that is how sad it was I was just not

30:43.840 --> 30:48.080
meant to play Halo or any first-person shooter for that matter I don't think

30:48.080 --> 30:51.280
otherwise what did I end up doing in real life last night I went out to the

30:51.280 --> 30:57.080
casino and I lost $60 but you know that's okay because I'm gonna win it all

30:57.080 --> 31:03.160
back next time I'm gonna win it all back and I went to the buffet biggest buffets

31:03.160 --> 31:06.400
are awesome and you know when I went out to lunch with an old friend of mine

31:06.400 --> 31:09.280
today I went out to lunch with Julie today and she was saying you know when

31:09.280 --> 31:12.440
people say that they're going to the casino to go to the buffet that's just

31:12.440 --> 31:16.600
codes that's just code words for gambling and I'm like yeah sadly it is

31:16.600 --> 31:18.600
I go before the buffet.

31:18.600 --> 31:21.600
I only gambled a dollar.

31:21.600 --> 31:23.600
But you gambled.

31:23.600 --> 31:25.600
That's because I was bored. I was waiting for you to lose your seventy.

31:25.600 --> 31:29.600
Well you know what sucks is that I lost sixty dollars in like fifteen minutes.

31:29.600 --> 31:34.600
My buddy's playing pie gal poker, which I'd never heard of in my life, but I learned how to play by watching him.

31:34.600 --> 31:39.600
And he was there for like forty-five minutes and lost nine dollars. Nine.

31:39.600 --> 31:43.600
I lose sixty in a third of the time.

31:43.600 --> 31:45.600
Life sucks.

31:45.600 --> 31:51.600
I do. The chat room is saying you suck at gambling. I do suck at gambling. I'm just, I should stop. I really need to stop.

31:51.600 --> 31:53.600
But it's so addicting.

31:56.600 --> 31:58.600
Loki, how was your week? How was your day?

32:00.600 --> 32:04.600
He's getting his food finished up before he can talk on the microphone here.

32:04.600 --> 32:09.600
Is that still on cam? www.OrangeLoungeRadio.com? Our amazing Orange Lounge kitchen?

32:11.600 --> 32:13.600
Actually, we can't hear you, bud. Turn on the mic.

32:13.600 --> 32:20.600
Yes, it has a shot of the empty walk at the moment, which will be full.

32:20.600 --> 32:24.600
Well, had a cold this week, that sucked.

32:24.600 --> 32:27.600
I saw Constantine, that was pretty good.

32:27.600 --> 32:31.600
Played lots of Final Fantasy, that was pretty cool.

32:31.600 --> 32:38.600
And then, to top it all off, in the final nail in the coffin, my power supply goes out of my computer.

32:38.600 --> 32:39.600
That sucked.

32:39.600 --> 32:49.420
and so yeah so pretty much today was I was being very lethargic just like slept

32:49.420 --> 32:54.860
for 10 hours got up ate some waffles watched ghosts in the shell two

32:54.860 --> 32:58.540
innocents I actually watched one of my movies I got surprisingly enough and

32:58.540 --> 33:04.100
then slept for another three hours or I don't even know it slept for an hour or

33:04.100 --> 33:09.580
so I don't know why and now because I just realized I haven't had any actual

33:09.580 --> 33:14.820
protein in my body for a while and I kind of feel faint so I had to cook food

33:14.820 --> 33:20.620
and that's that was my week. When was the last time you ate? This morning I had

33:20.620 --> 33:25.380
waffles. Oh yeah waffles but no protein. No protein and waffles. Unfortunately not

33:25.380 --> 33:32.820
there's... Just waffle goodness. Waffle and Aunt Jemima. No protein and Aunt Jemima

33:32.820 --> 33:38.980
either or her syrup anyway. No her syrup has no protein in it. It's not very

33:38.980 --> 33:47.580
tangy either. Antimima might have protein in her though, but...anyway. Oh, and then

33:47.580 --> 33:53.460
we have another person who's knocking on the door, so... It's explicit! You know that knocker's

33:53.460 --> 33:58.180
just for decorative purposes, actually. Dude, I just found a neat link on somebody's picture.

33:58.180 --> 34:02.500
Alright, I'm done. Tell us about it. Alright, thanks, Logie. The Online Entomology Dictionary.

34:02.500 --> 34:08.540
That's pretty cool. And I guess just because I'm the only real nerd here that only I really

34:08.540 --> 34:12.160
would find that to be a cool thing well our listeners might be nerdy too you

34:12.160 --> 34:16.780
never know I'll link it in the chat room alright explicit since you just walked

34:16.780 --> 34:21.860
in why not tell us about your week in your day this week was been good and bad

34:21.860 --> 34:27.340
been busy throughout the whole time doing nothing but homework of course I'm

34:27.340 --> 34:33.620
taking like 15 units of class and I have two jobs so pretty hectic hey I heard

34:33.620 --> 34:39.620
I heard you ran into Magus this week in the arcade.

34:39.620 --> 34:42.620
Uh, what the hell?

34:42.620 --> 34:46.620
At school.

34:46.620 --> 34:49.620
A.R.C., you guys are playing Initial D or something?

34:49.620 --> 34:52.620
I don't play Initial D.

34:52.620 --> 34:57.620
This Dead Air was brought to you by a DDR Angel story.

34:57.620 --> 35:00.620
Hey, that's what I heard.

35:00.620 --> 35:04.620
Okay, whatever.

35:04.620 --> 35:08.620
Let's see, I did not get a chance to go to that tournament this Saturday.

35:08.620 --> 35:12.620
Oh yeah, that's right, there was another DDR tournament I didn't go to.

35:12.620 --> 35:16.620
I heard about it though. I heard about what happened at the tournament though.

35:16.620 --> 35:18.620
Ooh, what happened, Drama?

35:18.620 --> 35:23.620
Well, there's some good and bad stuff. Good was, it was a decent tournament and stuff, as far as I'm hearing.

35:23.620 --> 35:29.620
They've actually broadcasted a commercial for Marsh Madness.

35:29.620 --> 35:34.020
They did a commercial, like a little... No, no, they did like an intermission.

35:34.020 --> 35:38.220
Oh, okay. To talk about, um, March Madness 2K3

35:38.220 --> 35:41.740
with a combination of freestyle... March Madness 2003?

35:41.740 --> 35:44.820
I think... 2005, sorry. I think...

35:44.820 --> 35:48.820
Oh damn, I think we're a couple years late. I think we missed it.

35:48.820 --> 35:52.860
Sorry. That's alright. Anyways. What are they having it this year? March Madness always... Milpitas.

35:52.860 --> 35:57.780
Milpitas. But, uh, but, but, okay, now to go to the bad part of this...

35:57.780 --> 36:00.080
Wait, they had a Milpitas last year, didn't they?

36:00.080 --> 36:00.580
Yeah.

36:00.580 --> 36:02.380
I thought it was supposed to move around.

36:02.380 --> 36:05.580
But now they're going to the bad part about the whole tournament.

36:05.580 --> 36:08.080
Ooh, yay, drama, drama.

36:08.080 --> 36:13.780
According to what I've been hearing, the manager, Paul, in Milpitas Golf...

36:13.780 --> 36:15.880
Wait a minute, before you finish that sentence,

36:15.880 --> 36:20.980
the views and opinions expressed by Explicit are strictly his own and not those of Orange Law's Radio. Finish.

36:20.980 --> 36:23.980
Okay, what the...

36:23.980 --> 36:30.980
Okay, the manager in Milpitas Golf Land screwed the pads over.

36:30.980 --> 36:36.560
I heard there's people who are getting 10 misses in a song, or 12, there was no full

36:36.560 --> 36:39.100
combo throughout the whole tournament.

36:39.100 --> 36:40.100
Awesome.

36:40.100 --> 36:47.540
That's how bad the freaking pads were.

36:47.540 --> 36:53.620
Which also concerns me about Martial Madness 2K5, if the same result would happen again.

36:53.620 --> 36:56.620
Are they going to do DDR Idol in March Madness 2K5?

36:56.620 --> 37:00.620
Not this time. They're doing Freestyle Revolution Plus.

37:00.620 --> 37:05.620
No. Hey. No. As in Mike. No. You listening?

37:05.620 --> 37:10.620
I want DDR Idol. Now. Do it. Do it. Do it. Thank you.

37:10.620 --> 37:11.620
I'm not the one organizing it.

37:11.620 --> 37:13.620
I know. That's why I'm just putting out that special message.

37:13.620 --> 37:15.620
Do they have people in the Speed of Two or the one in April?

37:15.620 --> 37:18.620
The upcoming Sacramento tournament in April.

37:18.620 --> 37:20.620
We need another DDR Idol.

37:20.620 --> 37:29.620
Oh, speaking of tournament in April, somebody is actually in the process of organizing a tournament at that month in Sacramento.

37:29.620 --> 37:30.620
And it's not you?

37:30.620 --> 37:31.620
Not me.

37:31.620 --> 37:33.620
Oh, wow. Who's doing it?

37:33.620 --> 37:37.620
A friend of mine named DJ Aero. He's on the forums.

37:37.620 --> 37:38.620
Okay.

37:38.620 --> 37:42.620
Yeah, he wanted to go through the process of tournament organizing and stuff.

37:42.620 --> 37:44.620
Good luck! Good luck, kid!

37:44.620 --> 37:46.620
Have fun!

37:46.620 --> 37:50.620
It's not an easy path, but I have faith in him.

37:50.620 --> 37:52.620
No, it's really not easy.

37:52.620 --> 37:58.620
If he puts the time and effort into it, it'll be a good tourney. I don't doubt.

37:58.620 --> 38:02.620
Remember when we did tourneys, Janie? Did I say Janie?

38:02.620 --> 38:09.620
Yep. And this is as long as people can accept criticism without taking it personally?

38:09.620 --> 38:15.620
Sorry. I know, I know, I know. That was an issue back then, but...

38:15.620 --> 38:17.620
That was an issue a few weeks ago.

38:17.620 --> 38:28.620
Yeah, but there was a lot of heat and drama. There was like so much heat and drama at the time that I hope that it does not happen in July.

38:28.620 --> 38:37.620
Yeah, I made mistakes. I admit I made mistakes, but I admit my mistakes and learn from it and hopefully it doesn't happen.

38:37.620 --> 38:41.620
Good for you that you can admit that we've all made mistakes.

38:41.620 --> 39:01.620
A lot of things went through a tournament organizing itself. There's always going to be a conflict, an unexpected conflict that you may not be able to do, because it could be the pad issue, but sometimes the place may restrict you from doing certain things.

39:01.620 --> 39:06.140
I say next time there's a clause written into the contract that says

39:06.140 --> 39:10.140
or you know the the gaming thing that says if the pads break down during the

39:10.140 --> 39:10.700
tournament

39:10.700 --> 39:14.580
the tournament will instantly become a whack-a-mole competition and we'll just all play

39:14.580 --> 39:15.260
whack-a-mole

39:15.260 --> 39:20.020
because whack-a-mole is awesome. Well if there isn't really a big pad error on one side you can try

39:20.020 --> 39:20.620
doing it

39:20.620 --> 39:25.340
on the other. Unless if both sides are messed up.

39:25.340 --> 39:29.140
That's what happened at our first SACO tourney is that one of the

39:29.140 --> 39:36.140
sides was screwing up, so we ended up having to do PA all on one side, which, you know,

39:36.140 --> 39:41.020
it made things go a little longer, but at the same time, we were on schedule, I think,

39:41.020 --> 39:45.020
this was years ago, but I think it ended up being on schedule anyway, so we weren't too

39:45.020 --> 39:51.060
bad, but it was just kind of a bummer that that had to happen, you know, but, crap happens.

39:51.060 --> 39:52.060
It happens.

39:52.060 --> 39:55.620
But if both pads, like I said, if both pads don't function, then you can't really run

39:55.620 --> 40:00.100
tournament or just or I don't even know what's gonna happen right there

40:00.100 --> 40:04.460
what does the Milpitas have like 50 machines DER machines they can use?

40:04.460 --> 40:11.460
unfortunately it's under Paul or MGL's management manager itself it means this

40:11.460 --> 40:15.020
is what the reason why I mean hearing why did they not switch the pads the

40:15.020 --> 40:19.260
intergroove pads which is almost in good condition I don't like anyone plays in the

40:19.260 --> 40:25.020
groove I heard according to what I'm hearing from the sources I'm hearing

40:25.020 --> 40:28.020
In The Group makes a lot more money than DDR in Milpitas.

40:28.020 --> 40:31.020
Well, I'm not surprised, because there's no new DDR game.

40:31.020 --> 40:37.020
And the fact that they did not use the In The Group pads for that tournament makes me wonder what happened.

40:39.020 --> 40:43.020
I mean, they're extreme in 4th plus with the messed up pads, so...

40:46.020 --> 40:48.020
But anyways, let's move on. Sorry if I...

40:48.020 --> 40:53.020
No, that's alright. Don't listen to the chat room. Don't listen to the chat room.

40:53.020 --> 40:57.020
Here you go, Jamie. Here's some Advil.

40:57.020 --> 41:01.020
Or you can watch Willy Cook.

41:01.020 --> 41:05.020
We can learn from tournament drama.

41:05.020 --> 41:09.020
Is anybody going to E3? I want to.

41:09.020 --> 41:13.020
I know that Jamie and Matt are, but I have to do the business stuff for Orange Lounge still,

41:13.020 --> 41:17.020
which I need to get up off my ass and do this week.

41:17.020 --> 41:21.020
But I want to go. Why? Why are you asking?

41:21.020 --> 41:25.020
a group of people going to E3 and stuff, if possible.

41:25.020 --> 41:27.020
I'll be at E3, but I'm going with DDRFreak.

41:27.020 --> 41:32.020
Yeah, I'll be at E3, but, I mean, I have no- I'm too early to plan.

41:32.020 --> 41:39.020
Hey, who never knows? Who knows if the tickets will cost more, like, later on? I'm not really sure.

41:39.020 --> 41:45.020
Well, you can pay to get in if you got a couple hundred bucks sitting around, but, you know, you're supposed to

41:45.020 --> 41:47.020
get the hookup by having some game companies.

41:47.020 --> 41:56.020
I know like, I know like places like Gamestop, EB, and various other gaming companies, or as long as you have an access to like a gaming, or any interest of gaming itself.

41:56.020 --> 42:00.020
I had friends that went under EB Games and Gamestop, I've seen that.

42:00.020 --> 42:04.020
I know about, I know people too, as well, so.

42:04.020 --> 42:05.020
Well, we'll see.

42:05.020 --> 42:13.020
You can even say that you have a website dedicated to games, even though you don't have it.

42:13.020 --> 42:19.520
Now, now wait a minute, wait a minute. It is kind of hard to get in on a website, trust me, I know from experience,

42:19.520 --> 42:27.020
because we have a problem proving Orange Lounge Radio is a legit gaming thing, even though, God, we promote the hell out of certain video games,

42:27.020 --> 42:38.520
and our podcast is more popular than what we're doing here right now, so, you know, and it's listened to by quite a few people, but we're still, we're still just a hobby, I guess.

42:38.520 --> 42:40.020
Hmm.

42:40.020 --> 42:41.020
I don't know.

42:41.020 --> 42:46.020
Because I don't know if someone I knew who had a fake website and went into E3 for some, somehow.

42:46.020 --> 42:50.020
If you know who did, if you know what to do, I guess it's possible.

42:50.020 --> 42:55.020
But I don't, I'm not good with that stuff, like bargaining and dealing my way in, so.

42:55.020 --> 42:59.020
Hmm.

42:59.020 --> 43:03.020
Alright. Well anyway, what we're going to do is we're going to go to a break, we're going to come back,

43:03.020 --> 43:08.020
and then we're going to talk about some more Bomani news, I guess, if we have any to talk about this week.

43:08.020 --> 43:14.300
something. And all your favorite Orange Lounge Radio segments when we come back after this

43:14.300 --> 43:19.820
little break featuring another mix of various songs from various CDR mixes. We'll be back.

43:19.820 --> 43:26.820
listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

45:19.820 --> 45:24.820
To be or to be on my side

46:54.820 --> 46:56.820
Yeah

48:24.820 --> 48:38.260
Every time I lose my self-control It feels like I can't let you go

48:38.260 --> 48:48.900
I'm at the point of no return You don't ever wanna come back down

48:48.900 --> 48:52.400
I'm not so high up on the ground

48:52.400 --> 48:55.900
This feeling I will always do

48:55.900 --> 48:57.900
Do, do, do, do, do

48:57.900 --> 48:59.900
Getting away

48:59.900 --> 49:01.900
I'm flying

49:01.900 --> 49:04.900
I'm gonna head for paradise

49:04.900 --> 49:06.900
Nothing to say

49:06.900 --> 49:08.900
I'm climbing

49:08.900 --> 49:12.260
I wanna stay right here tonight

49:38.900 --> 50:06.300
And now, let's listen in to an Orange Lounge Radio staff meeting as they debate some of

50:06.300 --> 50:09.580
the new programming coming to Orange Lounge Radio.

50:09.580 --> 50:14.340
Um, Jamie, I have a suggestion about some of the music in our Bomani Music & More program,

50:14.340 --> 50:15.560
can we talk about that?

50:15.560 --> 50:17.740
No subject will ever be taboo.

50:17.740 --> 50:22.380
Well, I was thinking maybe we should move, pump up the volume from Tuesday nights?

50:22.380 --> 50:25.220
Except of course the subject that was just under discussion.

50:25.220 --> 50:30.020
Okay, well, what would you think if maybe we cut back on some of the tack music we play

50:30.020 --> 50:31.100
on the station?

50:31.100 --> 50:34.780
I collect your fucking head.

50:34.780 --> 50:41.780
Oh my god, why did you do that to Loki? The holic thing on episode 69 was just a joke!

50:41.780 --> 50:48.780
Now if any of you sons of bitches got anything else to say, now's the fucking time!

50:48.780 --> 50:54.780
Orange Lounge Radio, where everybody has a say.

50:54.780 --> 50:56.780
where everybody has a say.

51:24.780 --> 51:27.840
just be ready for that you want more information on getting in on the

51:27.840 --> 51:32.980
skyline www.orangelandtrader.com click on interact with us hey while you're on

51:32.980 --> 51:38.100
our website check out the podcast which by the way has been taken off quite a

51:38.100 --> 51:41.420
little bit of popularity it looks like so I'm very excited about that we've

51:41.420 --> 51:44.580
been downloaded a lot of time so it's a good time the podcast is a good time and

51:44.580 --> 51:48.700
you can take that show with with you uh everywhere you go and it's not the same

51:48.700 --> 51:54.180
it's not the rehashed crap we do here it's it's new crap so enjoy that how you

51:54.180 --> 51:56.180
What are you doing over there, DarkSakura? You good?

51:56.180 --> 51:58.180
I'm a little sniffy again.

51:58.180 --> 52:00.180
Oh, I'm sorry to hear it.

52:00.180 --> 52:04.180
Alright, before we get into what's going on with the match game,

52:04.180 --> 52:08.180
I thought we could talk about what's going on in the Bamani world,

52:08.180 --> 52:11.180
and a little bit of maybe the general gaming world as well.

52:11.180 --> 52:14.180
Loki, you heard something about what's going on with DDR.

52:14.180 --> 52:19.180
Apparently, there is a new DDR game out in arcades.

52:19.180 --> 52:21.180
But don't get excited just yet, kids.

52:21.180 --> 52:23.180
Yeah, it's another bootleg.

52:23.180 --> 52:25.180
Okay, well, give us some detail.

52:26.180 --> 52:27.680
Okay. Well.

52:29.180 --> 52:32.180
Coming to a Namco arcade near you. Yes, Namco.

52:33.180 --> 52:39.180
Such proprietors as, um, the DDR Megamix and all the other shitty bootlegs that Namco buys.

52:39.180 --> 52:41.180
Um. Go Namco.

52:41.180 --> 52:43.180
Namco didn't make them. They just bought them.

52:43.180 --> 52:46.180
No, they buy them. They dumb enough to buy them, like, four times, okay?

52:46.180 --> 52:50.180
Anyways. So, they are stocking... I see there's...

52:50.180 --> 52:52.180
...hundreds of these things.

52:52.180 --> 52:59.460
coming out to an arcade near you and it's basically a PlayStation 2 inside of

52:59.460 --> 53:04.940
cabinet with some special hardware and it's running I kid you not the DDR

53:04.940 --> 53:11.580
extreme the US version so you've got that running in there and well it sucks

53:11.580 --> 53:16.540
the pads aren't even normal pads they're just the shitty internet or like the

53:16.540 --> 53:23.220
the ones you can get off of eBay, so they break really quick. It's just shit. That's

53:23.220 --> 53:29.740
all that needs to be said. So basically, is it the same, it's just DDR

53:29.740 --> 53:33.060
Extreme on PS2? It's running straight off of PS2.

53:33.060 --> 53:35.820
How does that work with the quarters and all the different modes and stuff?

53:35.820 --> 53:39.100
You can actually buy stuff, they have them like for Dreamcast and stuff like that. You

53:39.100 --> 53:45.140
can actually get where it has a whole quarter system and it'll lock the game out. I don't

53:45.140 --> 53:50.300
really know how that would work though as far as you know allowing you to push

53:50.300 --> 53:53.460
start and I think might be have something to do with pushing start the

53:53.460 --> 53:58.940
start button er and that's how it works I'm not really sure to be honest how but

53:58.940 --> 54:04.500
I've seen him out there they do exist but yeah there's been pictures circling

54:04.500 --> 54:12.940
around the internet and it's literally a ps2 inside of a cabinet I was trying to

54:12.940 --> 54:15.940
find more information on this over on freak or something I'm having our time

54:15.940 --> 54:19.860
finding the thread I know I saw something was it it was that where was

54:19.860 --> 54:23.540
that maybe I'll have to check this out it does it do the song speed up thing

54:23.540 --> 54:27.340
that the last one did because remember the last bootleg would like speed the

54:27.340 --> 54:31.780
song up by 20% it was supposed to be this great new challenge no no no this

54:31.780 --> 54:38.800
isn't even this is just a PlayStation 2 running DDR extreme the US version does

54:38.800 --> 54:44.800
Does it have the webcam? With the itoy type interface.

54:44.800 --> 54:48.800
Does it actually have an itoy hooked up? Nope.

54:48.800 --> 54:56.800
That's lame. And the thing is, I think people are trying to push it off as like DDR 9th mix or whatever.

54:56.800 --> 54:58.800
It's pretty lame.

54:58.800 --> 55:03.800
Okay, I found that post. It's over here on aaroninjapan.com if you want to check this out.

55:03.800 --> 55:09.700
It's called Namco, once again outdoes itself in stupidity, posted by WinDoo, WinDoe, I

55:09.700 --> 55:13.480
think it's supposed to be WinDoe, D-E-U, 32.

55:13.480 --> 55:17.800
Hey kids, it's the new DDR mix, no, not Megamix, no, not even Extreme Plus.

55:17.800 --> 55:23.600
This time, we're really lower the bar by putting the PS2, US Extreme, and the 2A DDR cabinet.

55:23.600 --> 55:26.120
Not only that, but we've also changed the pads.

55:26.120 --> 55:30.360
They're now Cobalt Flux wannabes, included with sheet metal on metal contact, but with

55:30.360 --> 55:32.180
a springy, cushiony feel to them.

55:32.180 --> 55:33.380
Now the layout.

55:33.380 --> 55:36.900
When you insert a coin, a big ugly number appears at the bottom center of the screen.

55:36.900 --> 55:39.620
The thing looks like it came straight out of Atari.

55:39.620 --> 55:43.580
Now when you insert enough coins for a credit and press start, you go to the main menu of

55:43.580 --> 55:44.580
the game.

55:44.580 --> 55:47.780
You can't select anything though, it just goes straight into game mode.

55:47.780 --> 55:51.580
Here you have the option of selecting single, versus, or double, regardless of how many

55:51.580 --> 55:53.120
credits you put in.

55:53.120 --> 55:57.020
If you go to versus with one credit, you are stuck at the character selection screen until

55:57.020 --> 55:59.740
you put another credit to activate the other side.

55:59.740 --> 56:03.620
Time goes for double, only you can actually go into the song select screen and pick a

56:03.620 --> 56:04.620
song.

56:04.620 --> 56:09.780
However, one of the sides will not be active at all.

56:09.780 --> 56:11.000
On to the gameplay.

56:11.000 --> 56:15.760
If you've ever played DDR Extreme US CS or DDR Festival, you know what to expect.

56:15.760 --> 56:18.060
Anyway you pick the song, but what's this?

56:18.060 --> 56:19.340
No mod menu?

56:19.340 --> 56:23.220
That's right, no possible way to get into the modifier menu.

56:23.220 --> 56:25.520
All you can really do is pick your difficulty.

56:25.520 --> 56:29.140
I've noticed though messing around that you can hit the left right select buttons in place

56:29.140 --> 56:34.060
of the left right arrows. So if an L.R. jump freeze is coming up, no problem! Step off

56:34.060 --> 56:38.300
the pad and hit both the buttons at the same time. I've also noticed that if you're holding

56:38.300 --> 56:43.820
a freeze and hit the start button, the freeze drops, even though you're still on the arrow.

56:43.820 --> 56:47.580
Also if you're playing single player, a credit is in the machine, and someone decides to

56:47.580 --> 56:52.800
press the other side's start button during song select, then bam! Instant verses, also

56:52.800 --> 56:57.480
known as the third mix effect. And of course, if you're one song away from your completing

56:57.480 --> 57:02.700
your set and suddenly decide to play non-stop or challenge, no problem. Remember, in Extreme

57:02.700 --> 57:07.300
US Consumer, you can go into non-stop challenge even on your final song. And hey, if you really

57:07.300 --> 57:12.760
want to piss people off, go for the 20-song custom-ony course. With a possible 22 songs

57:12.760 --> 57:17.840
per game, there's no way you can lose. Well, actually, you've already lost if you've put

57:17.840 --> 57:23.540
your money into this piece of shit. That post again coming from window32 at erininjapan.com.

57:23.540 --> 57:25.540
Thank you for letting me plagiarize your post without any information.

57:25.540 --> 57:34.540
So as my theory went, it is pretty much, you know, you have to put in so many credits, and after a while, it will let you use the start button.

57:34.540 --> 57:37.540
That's why you can't get into the mods, because the mods use the start button.

57:37.540 --> 57:45.540
And obviously it's wired for the, you know, select screen and stuff, that's why the left and right work on that.

57:45.540 --> 57:48.540
So yeah, it's just a hack job.

57:48.540 --> 57:50.800
refresh my memory here for a little bit

57:50.800 --> 57:53.840
isn't there some type of disclaimer

57:53.840 --> 57:57.400
when you boot up the art stream u s it says something about

57:57.400 --> 58:01.960
this game is licensed for personal and home use only

58:01.960 --> 58:03.520
uh... any

58:03.520 --> 58:04.560
so come on

58:04.560 --> 58:07.620
every every game has that have a wife the f b i warning

58:07.620 --> 58:08.880
i don't everything

58:08.880 --> 58:10.600
and i don't like it

58:10.600 --> 58:11.800
use within the united

58:11.800 --> 58:13.640
states or whatever

58:13.640 --> 58:14.960
or north america

58:14.960 --> 58:18.160
however that works

58:18.160 --> 58:22.160
I've already sent an email to Konami, and I'm sure other people have too.

58:22.160 --> 58:25.160
Wait a minute. You sent an email to Konami to tell on them?

58:25.160 --> 58:27.160
Did you tell? Are you a tattletale?

58:27.160 --> 58:29.160
I just wanted to see what they'd say.

58:29.160 --> 58:30.160
Did they reply?

58:30.160 --> 58:31.160
Yeah, they did.

58:31.160 --> 58:33.160
They said they were forwarding it to their...

58:33.160 --> 58:34.160
Because I did...

58:34.160 --> 58:40.160
It was to Konami of Hawaii, and they were forwarding it to Konami of America or somewhere.

58:40.160 --> 58:42.160
I don't know, some other Konami division.

58:42.160 --> 58:45.160
Because Konami's got like 50 different divisions and we can't tell.

58:45.160 --> 58:46.160
They're all Konami to us.

58:46.160 --> 58:47.160
Yeah.

58:47.160 --> 58:49.160
Alright, interesting.

58:49.160 --> 58:54.160
This is the same day that I also wrote the email to PETA.

58:54.160 --> 58:57.160
Loki's been a big tattletale this week.

58:57.160 --> 59:00.160
What is that website, savetoby.com?

59:00.160 --> 59:03.160
There's this website where they're threatening to kill a bunny,

59:03.160 --> 59:05.160
and I was joking in Loki's live journal.

59:05.160 --> 59:07.160
I said, ha ha, you should send that to PETA.

59:07.160 --> 59:08.160
I bet they'd have a field day with it.

59:08.160 --> 59:09.160
So he did.

59:09.160 --> 59:13.160
He sent it to them, and they wrote back this huge old email that said,

59:13.160 --> 59:17.460
that said people like to play pranks on the internet and that's just sick I

59:17.460 --> 59:22.160
thought it was funny I hate PETA I so hate them but I just wanted to see that

59:22.160 --> 59:27.680
website get shut down because because he's making lots of money like 15 grand

59:27.680 --> 59:32.480
off of it so far explicit your thoughts on this

59:32.480 --> 59:36.480
Oh, your thoughts on that?

59:36.480 --> 59:40.480
What the fuck?

59:40.480 --> 59:44.480
DDR WTF mix. First we have

59:44.480 --> 59:48.480
the 20% speed up DDR Extreme Plus, and now we have

59:48.480 --> 59:52.480
this type of crap that doesn't even work at all.

59:52.480 --> 59:56.480
But, oh my gods, you can play

59:56.480 --> 01:00:00.480
Go West in the arcade and everything, and your reign.

01:00:00.480 --> 01:00:07.880
own work, so what's the point? If the pads are going to be broken within the next day,

01:00:07.880 --> 01:00:09.720
would there be an actual point of playing the game?

01:00:09.720 --> 01:00:18.920
Oh, it looks like, actually I'm getting a private message from one of our buddies in

01:00:18.920 --> 01:00:23.800
chat and he's actually sending me a link to a picture that shows you can actually get

01:00:23.800 --> 01:00:28.120
the modifiers in this crappy game. Let me post this picture, I hope they don't mind,

01:00:28.120 --> 01:00:31.780
but I'm gonna post it in our chat room and so you can take a look at that you

01:00:31.780 --> 01:00:34.720
actually can access the modifiers in this somehow looks like somebody figured

01:00:34.720 --> 01:00:38.400
it out so yeah you know how they did it huh they said they like stomped on a

01:00:38.400 --> 01:00:47.480
bunch of the buttons up up down down left right left right maybe no but maybe

01:00:47.480 --> 01:00:52.640
they have some video maybe maybe what they're trying to do is just inspire the

01:00:52.640 --> 01:00:57.060
they're getting their inspiration from the old mixes of DDR remember back when

01:00:57.060 --> 01:01:06.060
They're trying to make a buck off Namco. Honestly, I could take a shit in a box, put it in a DDR cabinet and sell it to Namco and they'd fucking buy it, because they're retarded.

01:01:09.060 --> 01:01:13.060
No, left down... Remember when left down right down left was little? LITTLE!

01:01:13.060 --> 01:01:25.060
You know, honestly, um, I should, you know, just create some stupid mix right now with stepmania and cellotone. I can make money, because they're gonna buy it. I'll say, it's DDR9 mix.

01:01:25.060 --> 01:01:31.060
And wouldn't that be ironic if Konami came after you because somebody tattled on you, just like you tattled on these guys?

01:01:31.060 --> 01:01:34.060
Well, obviously they haven't come after these people since they keep making them.

01:01:34.060 --> 01:01:36.060
Speaking of selling in StepMania...

01:01:36.060 --> 01:01:39.060
Yes, explicit. Speaking of selling in StepMania...

01:01:39.060 --> 01:01:50.060
Speaking of that, does anybody remember about some guy in eBay selling an actual bootlegged CD of StepMania and saying DDR complete?

01:01:50.060 --> 01:01:56.060
You can sell SetMania. You can. It's in the license agreement. You just can't include songs with it.

01:01:56.060 --> 01:02:01.060
Yeah, and one of the songs says Banner.png.

01:02:01.060 --> 01:02:07.060
On first, second, third, fourth, fifth, and et cetera, et cetera.

01:02:07.060 --> 01:02:12.060
So, what happened with this on eBay? Did something happen, or are we just talking...

01:02:12.060 --> 01:02:17.060
Six people bought it. Six people actually bought it. For ten bucks.

01:02:17.060 --> 01:02:22.100
the average Joe gamer doesn't know though the average parent trying to find

01:02:22.100 --> 01:02:25.740
that sees DDR on Good Morning America and wants to get it for their kids

01:02:25.740 --> 01:02:27.220
doesn't know crap about

01:02:27.220 --> 01:02:30.460
these people are just preying off the week

01:02:30.460 --> 01:02:33.940
okay does not include any of the MP3's

01:02:33.940 --> 01:02:37.980
to the way the way everything is organized

01:02:37.980 --> 01:02:41.820
in terms of folder wise you get

01:02:41.820 --> 01:02:46.020
highs off you in 6th, 7th and 8th mix so you have duplicates of the same song

01:02:46.020 --> 01:02:54.020
It's like those 64-in-1 Taiwanese bootlegs that used to be able to get for the NES.

01:02:54.020 --> 01:02:57.020
Exactly. Just like those, but much worse.

01:02:57.020 --> 01:03:01.020
Where it would have Contra in it eight times, but maybe the player was a different color.

01:03:01.020 --> 01:03:04.020
I bought that for my friend for Christmas.

01:03:04.020 --> 01:03:14.860
Hehehe, sad. Where the zapper gun looked like a normal gun. And the controller was an old

01:03:14.860 --> 01:03:22.920
Nintendo 64 controller that had the analog stick glued in there. And then the other controller

01:03:22.920 --> 01:03:33.940
was a Genesis controller that they wired up. It's funny because after Christmas or whatever,

01:03:33.940 --> 01:03:37.620
They never came back to their kiosk in the mall, they're gone.

01:03:37.620 --> 01:03:42.600
I'm surprised people don't put this show up on eBay.

01:03:42.600 --> 01:03:44.740
We'll sue your ass.

01:03:44.740 --> 01:03:48.180
No we won't.

01:03:48.180 --> 01:03:51.980
Would anybody buy- we should put copies of the show on eBay and see what happens.

01:03:51.980 --> 01:03:54.340
I'm gonna buy them.

01:03:54.340 --> 01:03:56.620
Anyway.

01:03:56.620 --> 01:04:02.240
Of course we're probably violating all sorts of copyright laws by doing that, but hey.

01:04:02.240 --> 01:04:06.440
What's going on in the sim scene right now, Loki? Anything going on in the sim scene?

01:04:06.440 --> 01:04:09.320
Even though all the sites are down?

01:04:09.320 --> 01:04:10.920
Um...

01:04:10.920 --> 01:04:14.320
No.

01:04:14.320 --> 01:04:18.000
Really, I don't think there's anything going on.

01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:22.720
I can't confirm that since my computer's broken, but uh...

01:04:22.720 --> 01:04:29.720
The last thing I remember from the DDR sim scene was last week with uh...

01:04:29.720 --> 01:04:34.720
What was that, Max? Max Vagina, yes.

01:04:34.720 --> 01:04:46.720
That's about, that's the creme de la creme of the, uh, sim scene there, so uh, Max Vagina.

01:04:46.720 --> 01:04:50.720
Hmm, yeah.

01:04:50.720 --> 01:04:52.720
On that note, I think we're going to go to another break.

01:04:52.720 --> 01:04:55.720
When we come back, boys and girls, we're going to get into tonight's Match Game!

01:04:55.720 --> 01:05:05.720
Yay! And after the match game, we're going to do the cage match and all those other segments you've come to know and love here on Orange Lounge Radio.

01:05:05.720 --> 01:05:15.720
So we will be back after this. In this break, hmm, how about we're going to do some Smile DK to start it off, because we haven't played Smile DK in a while.

01:05:15.720 --> 01:05:22.720
We'll be back after this.

01:05:45.720 --> 01:05:49.720
No more ringing on my phone

01:05:49.720 --> 01:05:53.720
No, just by and night I found your letter

01:05:53.720 --> 01:05:56.720
Maybe you don't love me anymore

01:05:56.720 --> 01:06:00.720
Foolish me, thinking we will last forever

01:06:00.720 --> 01:06:03.720
Dancing all alone, singing tambidos

01:06:03.720 --> 01:06:07.720
Listening to the music from the radio, oh

01:06:07.720 --> 01:06:10.720
Dancing all alone, singing tambidos

01:06:10.720 --> 01:06:13.280
We're sending them together with my room

01:06:13.280 --> 01:06:17.720
E-O-E-O, E-O-E-O, E-O-E-O

01:06:17.720 --> 01:06:21.320
And I feel lonely, I can't handle it, oh

01:06:21.320 --> 01:06:24.720
E-O-E-O, E-O-E-O

01:06:24.720 --> 01:06:28.720
When I feel lonely, I can only love, oh

01:08:54.720 --> 01:08:56.720
Like the time

01:08:57.720 --> 01:09:00.720
You're very hard, you look like a young fella

01:09:00.720 --> 01:09:03.720
Take me overnight

01:09:03.720 --> 01:09:05.720
Boom, boom, boom, boom

01:09:05.720 --> 01:09:07.720
Shake it like a bubble

01:09:07.720 --> 01:09:09.720
Boom, boom, boom, boom

01:09:09.720 --> 01:09:11.720
Back in the water

01:09:11.720 --> 01:09:12.720
Boom, boom, boom, boom

01:09:12.720 --> 01:09:14.720
Pushing all the buttons

01:09:14.720 --> 01:09:16.720
More

01:09:16.720 --> 01:09:18.720
Time

01:09:18.720 --> 01:09:20.720
Boom, boom, boom, boom

01:09:20.720 --> 01:09:21.720
Ay-ay-ay-ay

01:09:21.720 --> 01:09:23.720
Boom, boom, boom, boom

01:11:23.720 --> 01:11:43.240
Hi Ho, Kermit the Frog here informing you that today's broadcast of Orange Lounge Radio

01:11:43.240 --> 01:11:47.400
is brought to you by the letter B, the letter A, and the number 59.

01:11:47.400 --> 01:11:53.400
Can you tell me how to get, how to get to Sesame Street?

01:12:17.400 --> 01:12:22.160
I actually have a prize for our winner tonight.

01:12:22.160 --> 01:12:25.480
Oh, you have a prize? Not with me, but I will send it to them.

01:12:25.480 --> 01:12:28.680
I have a Resident Evil 4 music sampler.

01:12:28.680 --> 01:12:35.320
Very cool! An actual prize! And I have like an ESPN Sports one too if they want like a whole pack of them.

01:12:35.320 --> 01:12:40.000
So tonight you don't get hung up on if you win or you get, you know, your

01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:43.320
window closed, I suppose, if you're the chat room contestant. You win an

01:12:43.320 --> 01:12:47.360
actual prize. Amazing. Also the winner, going to the winner will be the company

01:12:47.360 --> 01:13:02.840
UbiSoft. Wow, okay. Alright, that's awesome. I have to see if I, I don't have my match

01:13:02.840 --> 01:13:07.880
game theme music anymore and I don't have Loki's computer to leech it from, so I suppose

01:13:07.880 --> 01:13:14.640
we'll have to fill in with our listless music tonight. Or I could just cough from the microphone.

01:13:14.640 --> 01:13:17.640
That would be a lovely way to do it. Alright.

01:13:17.640 --> 01:13:21.640
How about we just play Genocide, and that'll be the uh, match game music.

01:13:21.640 --> 01:13:29.640
Alright, we have to get a caller on the Skype line, so we're gonna open this up to the very first person to call us on the Skype line right now!

01:13:29.640 --> 01:13:36.640
First person to call us on the Skype line gets to play match game against our unknown contestant in the chat room, currently, because I haven't said who it is yet.

01:13:36.640 --> 01:13:43.640
And, we'll get a chance to win a Resident Evil 4 music sampler! Awesome.

01:13:43.640 --> 01:13:46.640
How is Resident Evil 4? I haven't really played it yet.

01:13:46.640 --> 01:13:47.640
I haven't really played it yet.

01:13:47.640 --> 01:13:49.640
I've seen it, and it looks very rad.

01:13:49.640 --> 01:13:50.640
It's very good.

01:13:50.640 --> 01:13:59.640
It's practically, if you're one of the casual games, it's probably one of the best, or by far the best Resident Evil out there.

01:13:59.640 --> 01:14:00.640
Wow.

01:14:00.640 --> 01:14:05.640
More dogs jumping through windows than you can ever imagine.

01:14:05.640 --> 01:14:13.640
I mean, it's like an actual 3D game rather than just a slight, like a camera view that was in 1, 2, and 3.

01:14:13.640 --> 01:14:15.640
You actually get to see everything.

01:14:18.640 --> 01:14:20.640
Nobody's calling in right now.

01:14:21.640 --> 01:14:23.640
Yeah, what demo bass is?

01:14:23.640 --> 01:14:26.640
Well, you know, we got that buffer, so it kind of makes things difficult,

01:14:26.640 --> 01:14:28.640
because we have a slight delay between the time I say,

01:14:28.640 --> 01:14:31.640
call now, and the time that they actually hear me say, call now.

01:14:31.640 --> 01:14:32.640
So...

01:14:32.640 --> 01:14:40.600
So, so, well you know what else is interesting is that a lot of our regulars who call in

01:14:40.600 --> 01:14:43.840
on the Skypliner are not here tonight, which is kind of weird.

01:14:43.840 --> 01:14:45.400
I don't know, what is going on tonight?

01:14:45.400 --> 01:14:48.960
What makes tonight so special?

01:14:48.960 --> 01:14:49.960
Three day weekend.

01:14:49.960 --> 01:14:53.680
Oh, I don't have a three day weekend.

01:14:53.680 --> 01:14:54.680
Why do these people get a three day weekend?

01:14:54.680 --> 01:14:56.680
Some of us work for a bank.

01:14:56.680 --> 01:14:58.680
Guess who doesn't have to work tomorrow?

01:14:58.680 --> 01:14:59.680
Me.

01:14:59.680 --> 01:15:14.340
Wow, you'd think by giving away a prize we'd have more people calling in.

01:15:14.340 --> 01:15:16.500
Fuck the Skype line, just have them do it through this charity.

01:15:16.500 --> 01:15:21.060
Well we have people that are in chat going, oh I've played before so I can't play again.

01:15:21.060 --> 01:15:23.220
Sure you can play again!

01:15:23.220 --> 01:15:25.780
Who cares?

01:15:25.780 --> 01:15:28.240
We actually have a prize to give away tonight.

01:15:28.240 --> 01:15:34.120
makes everybody eligible anyway all right if nobody calls in the fursuit

01:15:34.120 --> 01:15:37.120
because I know we've got a ton of people who are in chat because we have quite a

01:15:37.120 --> 01:15:40.680
few people in chat tonight but they just aren't on the skype line because you

01:15:40.680 --> 01:15:46.320
know you have to download skype and then you have to set it up and dah dah dah dah dah

01:15:46.320 --> 01:16:03.000
I'll just sit here and wait. We'll just sit here for the next two hours and I'll just

01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:14.800
wait. We can do that. Tick tock, tick tock. Wow. How stupid do we look right now?

01:16:14.800 --> 01:16:21.800
I see Paris Hilton's gonna be in a new horror movie coming up and it's called The Wax House.

01:16:21.800 --> 01:16:26.800
It looks decent, except Paris Hilton's in it and she doesn't get naked probably.

01:16:26.800 --> 01:16:31.800
I have something to add to that that you could probably make fun of.

01:16:31.800 --> 01:16:36.800
I heard her sidekick got hacked. Her T-Mobile sidekick got hacked.

01:16:36.800 --> 01:16:38.800
How does that work?

01:16:38.800 --> 01:16:43.620
We will um be doing Paris Hilton chat until somebody calls in the skype line

01:16:43.620 --> 01:16:46.920
So I suggest let me start downloading it fucking car already

01:16:47.920 --> 01:16:53.360
She did off Skype in if I know wait. No, I can't make fears down. Oh

01:16:54.060 --> 01:16:56.380
My god, you guys did you see the simple life this week?

01:16:56.380 --> 01:17:00.780
Oh my god was so funny you guys Paris Hilton was so funny on the simple life this week

01:17:00.940 --> 01:17:06.140
You know when she said, you know that one part when she said that's hot. I was so hot. Oh my god

01:17:06.140 --> 01:17:10.760
I love the civil life working at a more guy here, and you know and with her in the dead bodies

01:17:10.760 --> 01:17:16.140
And that was so creepy like oh my God, and then you totally needed to have a makeover

01:17:16.140 --> 01:17:20.740
She's like so my idol like I just want to be her one these days

01:17:20.740 --> 01:17:25.000
I wish I could be so rich and have all those clothes and the shoes. Oh my God

01:17:25.000 --> 01:17:42.000
Oh my god, did you see that episode where they were at the airport and they had to be

01:17:42.000 --> 01:17:46.000
the airport people and they were like waving and it was like they were dancing and they

01:17:46.000 --> 01:17:49.720
were just playing around and then they had to empty the poo out of the plane as punishment.

01:17:49.720 --> 01:17:51.520
It was so funny.

01:17:51.520 --> 01:17:53.960
And Paris Hilton was so funny.

01:17:53.960 --> 01:17:59.760
then the poo fell on them and then she's like wow I haven't done this since last

01:17:59.760 --> 01:18:07.600

01:18:12.040 --> 01:18:17.200

Now the skype line is lighting up with calls. I've got like four people hammering in all at once now.

01:18:58.800 --> 01:19:04.800
You ever hear that saying, you snooze, you lose? Well, apply it.

01:19:04.800 --> 01:19:13.800
You automatically win my eternal gratefulness. You have my gratitude forever.

01:19:13.800 --> 01:19:16.800
And the ferret loves you too.

01:19:16.800 --> 01:19:18.800
And I love the ferrets too, thank you.

01:19:22.800 --> 01:19:25.800
Okay, finally. You wanna know who you're playing against tonight, Ziggy?

01:19:26.800 --> 01:19:27.800
Uh, go ahead.

01:19:27.800 --> 01:19:31.800
Now you're playing for Resident Evil 4 sampler CD. Isn't that exciting?

01:19:32.800 --> 01:19:34.800
Uh, even though I don't play Silent Hill 4.

01:19:34.800 --> 01:19:36.800
Well, it's Resident Evil 4, so that's alright.

01:19:37.800 --> 01:19:38.800
Resident Evil 4!

01:19:38.800 --> 01:19:41.800
There's no way in hell I'm ever getting rid of my Silent Hill 4 sampler.

01:19:41.800 --> 01:19:42.800
I'm a kid!

01:19:43.800 --> 01:19:45.800
Oh, whatever.

01:19:45.800 --> 01:19:49.780
Think you just lost right there. I think I am lost

01:19:51.360 --> 01:19:53.360
All right

01:19:55.400 --> 01:19:59.680
All right, you're gonna play against MPQ in our chat room tonight

01:20:00.600 --> 01:20:06.000
All right, MPQ is gonna bring it. He was the guy who got our trivia question, right? Wait, hold on. Hold on, huh?

01:20:06.800 --> 01:20:08.800
Okay, I feel better. All right

01:20:09.040 --> 01:20:11.040
let's uh

01:20:11.040 --> 01:20:16.040
Let's get into tonight's match game. You know how the match game works, right?

01:20:16.040 --> 01:20:17.040
Yeah.

01:20:17.040 --> 01:20:21.040
Alright, we're going to ask you a question, and it has a blank in it.

01:20:21.040 --> 01:20:25.040
And then your job is to fill in the blank, and for every celebrity in the chatroom,

01:20:25.040 --> 01:20:28.040
or I'm sorry, every celebrity in the studio that you match, you get a point.

01:20:28.040 --> 01:20:32.040
But here's the thing, I'm going to be asking for an answer from MPQ as well.

01:20:32.040 --> 01:20:35.040
And for every answer that he matches, he gets a point.

01:20:35.040 --> 01:20:38.040
And he might walk away with that Resident Evil 4 sampler.

01:20:38.040 --> 01:20:44.040
So, don't let him do that, or you'll never understand the difference between Resident Evil and Silent Hill.

01:20:44.040 --> 01:20:45.040
Alright?

01:20:48.040 --> 01:20:50.040
Okay, repeat after me, Siggy.

01:20:50.040 --> 01:20:51.040
Resident Evil.

01:20:51.040 --> 01:20:53.040
Resident Evil, yeah, I got everything.

01:20:53.040 --> 01:20:54.040
Capcom.

01:20:54.040 --> 01:20:55.040
Yeah, I know.

01:20:55.040 --> 01:20:56.040
Silent Hill.

01:20:56.040 --> 01:20:57.040
Konami.

01:20:57.040 --> 01:20:58.040
Konami, there you go.

01:20:58.040 --> 01:20:59.040
I know, I know.

01:20:59.040 --> 01:21:00.040
Good.

01:21:00.040 --> 01:21:02.040
Yo, yo, turn down the Nitrous Oxide.

01:21:02.040 --> 01:21:05.040
Maybe we should send them a box of notebooks too.

01:21:05.040 --> 01:21:06.040
Wait, what?

01:21:06.040 --> 01:21:07.040
Maybe we should send them an Enterprise.

01:21:07.040 --> 01:21:09.040
Maybe. We'll see. We'll see if he's worthy.

01:21:09.040 --> 01:21:10.040
He sends you a rawhide bone.

01:21:10.040 --> 01:21:11.040
Let's see how he does.

01:21:11.040 --> 01:21:14.040
All right, here we go. First question. You guys ready?

01:21:14.040 --> 01:21:16.040
All right, here it is.

01:21:16.040 --> 01:21:22.040
Rob, hey, that's me, was all excited to start a brand new blogger this week

01:21:22.040 --> 01:21:25.040
all about his video game addictions.

01:21:25.040 --> 01:21:28.040
The staff and regulars of Orange Lounge Radio, though, were shocked

01:21:28.040 --> 01:21:33.040
when they visited the blog to find that the first entry wasn't about games at all,

01:21:33.040 --> 01:21:35.040
but about blank.

01:21:35.040 --> 01:21:39.040
OK, don't answer just yet, Siggy. We're going to let the celebrities have a chance to answer.

01:21:42.040 --> 01:21:51.040
Orange Lounge Radio staff was surprised to visit the blogger to find that it wasn't about video games at all, but the first entry was all about blank.

01:21:57.040 --> 01:21:58.040
Everybody's writing down.

01:21:58.040 --> 01:22:14.040
Okay, MPQ's locked in an answer.

01:22:14.040 --> 01:22:15.040
Jamie's dinged in.

01:22:15.040 --> 01:22:23.040
Magic came to heaven, love has got me breathing, love has got me breathing.

01:22:23.040 --> 01:22:27.040
Tell me what the feeling is, come on let's hear it.

01:22:27.040 --> 01:22:34.040
I got it!

01:22:35.420 --> 01:22:36.660
Alright.

01:22:36.660 --> 01:22:40.640
How you doing, Explicit? Got an answer?

01:22:40.640 --> 01:22:43.720
Staff and regulars of Warren's Lounge though were shocked when they visited the blog to find that the

01:22:43.720 --> 01:22:48.520
first entry wasn't about games at all but about blank.

01:22:48.520 --> 01:22:49.800
Angel, you got one?

01:22:49.800 --> 01:22:51.800
Still thinking. Angel's still thinking.

01:22:58.800 --> 01:22:59.800
Alright.

01:23:05.800 --> 01:23:07.800
Just the first thing that comes to your mind, Angel.

01:23:09.800 --> 01:23:13.800
Rob was all excited to start a brand new blogger this week all about his video game addictions.

01:23:13.800 --> 01:23:17.280
the staff and regulars of Orange Launch Radio though were shocked when they

01:23:17.280 --> 01:23:20.480
visited the blog to find that the first entry wasn't about games at all but

01:23:20.480 --> 01:23:30.160
about blank. Okay okay it looks like she's written something down explicit

01:23:30.160 --> 01:23:37.840
you good to go to? That it is it just go with your gut instinct all right all

01:23:37.840 --> 01:23:42.240
right Siggy here we go your answer please the staff and regulars of Orange

01:23:42.240 --> 01:23:44.240
Random Prawn!

01:24:12.240 --> 01:24:14.680
Boobies is not a match with Ham or Random Prawn.

01:24:14.680 --> 01:24:15.960
Explicit.

01:24:15.960 --> 01:24:17.000
Gay porn.

01:24:17.000 --> 01:24:21.640
Gay porn, I do believe that would be a match with Siggy.

01:24:21.640 --> 01:24:25.520
So one point for Siggy, zero for MPQ.

01:24:25.520 --> 01:24:26.600
Loki.

01:24:26.600 --> 01:24:29.360
Shocked to find it was all about Paris Hilton

01:24:29.360 --> 01:24:31.000
in her wonderful shoes.

01:24:31.000 --> 01:24:33.680
Paris Hilton.

01:24:33.680 --> 01:24:34.960
Not a match.

01:24:34.960 --> 01:24:35.960
Sorry.

01:24:35.960 --> 01:24:37.680
Angel.

01:24:37.680 --> 01:24:40.560
You're going to give me a look from the mouth.

01:24:40.560 --> 01:24:44.000
I said Kylie. All about Kylie.

01:24:44.000 --> 01:24:48.280
Very good answer but not a match, sorry. My answer was

01:24:48.280 --> 01:24:51.720
it was all about how he needed a date.

01:24:51.720 --> 01:24:55.000
This is the part where you feel pity.

01:24:55.000 --> 01:24:58.520
Thank you. Okay. Alright, thank you. Alright! That's enough.

01:24:58.520 --> 01:25:02.000
Alright. Alright, so Siggy's up by a point.

01:25:02.000 --> 01:25:06.480
Here we go. Question number two. It's MPQ's chance to catch up here.

01:25:06.480 --> 01:25:09.680
Loki was very sad. Oh,

01:25:09.680 --> 01:25:13.240
Where's my music? Where's my music? Thank you.

01:25:13.240 --> 01:25:16.440
Loki was very sad that his computer broke down.

01:25:16.440 --> 01:25:20.080
It seemed like the power supply just didn't want to cooperate anymore.

01:25:20.080 --> 01:25:25.000
He tried to fix it himself but couldn't, so he had his friend look at the PC

01:25:25.000 --> 01:25:28.200
who explained moments after opening it that,

01:25:28.200 --> 01:25:33.240
well, Loki, maybe it wouldn't have broken down so fast if you hadn't downloaded so much

01:25:33.240 --> 01:25:33.960
blank.

01:25:33.960 --> 01:25:53.040
Well, Loki, maybe it wouldn't have broke if you hadn't downloaded so much blank.

01:25:53.040 --> 01:25:54.360
Very funny, illusion.

01:25:54.360 --> 01:25:55.360
Very funny.

01:25:55.360 --> 01:25:58.920
I see our chat room there, huh?

01:25:58.920 --> 01:25:59.920
Yeah.

01:25:59.920 --> 01:26:05.920
Hey, laughter is my life, you know.

01:26:05.920 --> 01:26:14.920
Isn't this great? When you call in the skype line to the show, the chat room feels the need to make fun of you, as well as the rest of us here in the studio.

01:26:14.920 --> 01:26:17.920
Beautiful.

01:26:17.920 --> 01:26:23.920
One more time, I'll read this for the folks still thinking.

01:26:23.920 --> 01:26:27.920
Well, Loki was very sad that his computer broke down.

01:26:27.920 --> 01:26:31.920
It seemed like the power supply just didn't want to cooperate anymore.

01:26:31.920 --> 01:26:33.920
He tried to fix it himself, but couldn't.

01:26:33.920 --> 01:26:37.920
So he had his friend look at the PC who explained moments after opening it that,

01:26:37.920 --> 01:26:43.920
Well, Loki, maybe it wouldn't have broken down so fast if you hadn't downloaded so much blank.

01:26:43.920 --> 01:26:46.920
All right.

01:26:46.920 --> 01:26:49.920
I'm still waiting on the answer from MPQ as well.

01:26:49.920 --> 01:26:51.920
Oh no, there it is.

01:26:55.920 --> 01:26:57.920
Alright.

01:27:00.920 --> 01:27:02.920
How you guys doing? We ready?

01:27:02.920 --> 01:27:04.920
Looks like Angel's ready.

01:27:04.920 --> 01:27:06.920
Alright, everybody else is ready. And I think...

01:27:06.920 --> 01:27:08.920
Alright, we got MPQ's answer too.

01:27:08.920 --> 01:27:10.920
Alright, here we go.

01:27:10.920 --> 01:27:13.920
This time we'll go with MPQ first.

01:27:13.920 --> 01:27:18.920
MPQ says, well Loki, maybe it wouldn't have broken down so fast if you hadn't downloaded so much...

01:27:18.920 --> 01:27:23.220
Porn! Porn. Going for the obvious one there. Alright, Siggy.

01:27:23.220 --> 01:27:26.640
It wouldn't have broken down so fast if you hadn't downloaded so much.

01:27:26.640 --> 01:27:30.920
StepMania Sim Files. StepMania Sim Files.

01:27:30.920 --> 01:27:34.080
Oh, good answer. Good answer. Let's see. Jamie,

01:27:34.080 --> 01:27:38.640
wouldn't have broken so fast if you hadn't downloaded so much. Actually, I have to make this grammatically

01:27:38.640 --> 01:27:39.200
correct.

01:27:39.200 --> 01:27:42.600
So many. Final Fantasy XI porn patches.

01:27:42.600 --> 01:27:47.400
Final Fantasy XI porn patches. I don't know, is that a point for MPQ?

01:27:47.400 --> 01:27:51.220
Half a point. Half a point for MPQ! Yeah, look at that, there's so many of those online.

01:27:51.220 --> 01:27:55.500
Half a point for MPQ. Alright. So half, half a point to one point.

01:27:55.500 --> 01:27:59.240
Explicit! It would have broken down so fast if you hadn't download so much...

01:27:59.240 --> 01:28:02.280
So much hacking shit. So much hacking shit!

01:28:02.280 --> 01:28:07.120
Not a match, sorry guys. Loukey! It would have broken down so fast if you wouldn't have downloaded so much...

01:28:07.120 --> 01:28:10.580
Dust, because there's so much fucking dust in that case.

01:28:10.580 --> 01:28:13.720
Dust! If you hadn't downloaded so much dust!

01:28:13.720 --> 01:28:17.720
That's the only way I can figure it out, man. That case is dirty.

01:28:17.720 --> 01:28:21.720
All right, Angel. It wouldn't have broken so fast if you hadn't downloaded so many...

01:28:21.720 --> 01:28:23.720
Remixes of girls.

01:28:23.720 --> 01:28:25.720
Remixes of girls.

01:28:25.720 --> 01:28:26.720
Good answer.

01:28:26.720 --> 01:28:28.720
Good answer. Not a match.

01:28:28.720 --> 01:28:34.720
And I said, it wouldn't have broken so fast if you hadn't downloaded so many crappy remixes of Max 300.

01:28:34.720 --> 01:28:42.600
Now, now, Max Vagina has its special place in everyone's heart.

01:28:42.600 --> 01:28:51.040
All right, MPQ has half a point, Siggy has one point. It all comes down to this question.

01:28:51.040 --> 01:28:56.960
One point for MPQ could win it if Siggy doesn't get any. So we will see. And it's good he

01:28:56.960 --> 01:28:59.800
got half a point because this way we're not going to have a tie unless we get a half a

01:28:59.800 --> 01:29:04.000
point on this next one. But we'll see. And we've had a question about me, a question

01:29:04.000 --> 01:29:08.000
about Loki, so you know who this next one's about.

01:29:08.000 --> 01:29:09.320
Sure me.

01:29:09.320 --> 01:29:13.040
Dark Sakura decided that she was going to head out to RVGL

01:29:13.040 --> 01:29:14.960
to play some DER.

01:29:14.960 --> 01:29:17.440
Unfortunately, the pads were broken.

01:29:17.440 --> 01:29:19.920
And even more unfortunately for the parents and children

01:29:19.920 --> 01:29:23.000
present, they were shocked to hear Dark Sakura call

01:29:23.000 --> 01:29:24.880
the RVGL pads a blank.

01:29:30.400 --> 01:29:33.720
They were shocked to hear Dark Sakura call the Roseville Golf

01:29:33.720 --> 01:29:35.720
What's the plan, Pads? A blank.

01:29:38.520 --> 01:29:42.520
You can play with the grammar on that one a little bit if you need to. We'll make this a little harder. You can play with the grammar.

01:29:43.560 --> 01:29:46.560
So, she called the RVGL Pads blank, or she called them a blank.

01:29:52.120 --> 01:29:53.120
Alright.

01:29:53.120 --> 01:30:03.240
You know, if we go this year, we need to go see if the price is right.

01:30:03.240 --> 01:30:05.240
I know, I know.

01:30:05.240 --> 01:30:12.000
He isn't going to be living much longer, I mean, that hair can't turn much whiter.

01:30:12.000 --> 01:30:20.320
It's going to be transparent soon.

01:30:20.320 --> 01:30:31.240
They were shocked to hear DarkSakura call the RVGL pads a blank.

01:30:50.320 --> 01:30:59.480
Nothing, I'm just laughing at one of the answers.

01:30:59.480 --> 01:31:03.120
Alright, everybody ready in the studio?

01:31:03.120 --> 01:31:04.120
Yes?

01:31:04.120 --> 01:31:07.840
Alright, here we go.

01:31:07.840 --> 01:31:08.840
This is the last question.

01:31:08.840 --> 01:31:12.180
This is going to determine who walks away with a Resident Evil 4 music sampler.

01:31:12.180 --> 01:31:16.000
Dark Sakura decided that she was going to head out to RVGL and play some DDR.

01:31:16.000 --> 01:31:19.320
Unfortunately, the paths were broken and even more unfortunately, for the parents and children

01:31:19.320 --> 01:31:23.400
present, they were shocked to hear Dark Sakura call the RVGL pads A, Siggy?

01:31:23.400 --> 01:31:29.280
Piece of shit pad. Piece of shit pad. Not a piece of shit car, but a piece of shit

01:31:29.280 --> 01:31:35.840
pad. MPQ's answer says, was shocked to hear Dark Sakura call the

01:31:35.840 --> 01:31:43.040
Roseville Golf Land pads A, and I quote, fucking fuck shit fucker. So we will see,

01:31:43.040 --> 01:31:48.080
piece of shit pad and fucking fuck shit fucker. Dark Sakura, your

01:31:48.080 --> 01:31:49.080
Your answer, please.

01:31:49.080 --> 01:31:51.880
The metallic equivalent of fetid, regurgitated dog shit.

01:31:51.880 --> 01:31:52.880
Wow.

01:31:52.880 --> 01:32:01.260
Because they were all too stupid to know what fetid means.

01:32:01.260 --> 01:32:02.260
Not a match.

01:32:02.260 --> 01:32:04.460
Explicit, your answer.

01:32:04.460 --> 01:32:06.100
A motherfucking bitch.

01:32:06.100 --> 01:32:08.360
A motherfucking bitch.

01:32:08.360 --> 01:32:11.720
It's kind of close, but I'm not going to count it as a match.

01:32:11.720 --> 01:32:12.720
Sorry.

01:32:12.720 --> 01:32:13.720
Loki.

01:32:13.720 --> 01:32:15.080
Called them a?

01:32:15.080 --> 01:32:16.400
The lose.

01:32:16.400 --> 01:32:17.960
The lose.

01:32:17.960 --> 01:32:19.960
They are talloos.

01:32:19.960 --> 01:32:20.960
Alright.

01:32:20.960 --> 01:32:21.960
Angel, call the pads A.

01:32:21.960 --> 01:32:25.760
Let's just say she dropped the C-bomb.

01:32:25.760 --> 01:32:27.760
She dropped the C-bomb.

01:32:27.760 --> 01:32:28.760
But I don't.

01:32:28.760 --> 01:32:30.800
Rhymes with punt or shunt.

01:32:30.800 --> 01:32:32.720
I couldn't think of anything else.

01:32:32.720 --> 01:32:43.760
To quote Bette Midler, it starts with a C. It ends with a T and it spells cunt.

01:32:43.760 --> 01:32:45.000
Now that would have been a good answer.

01:32:45.000 --> 01:32:47.000
That's a direct quote.

01:32:47.000 --> 01:32:50.200
Here it is. It all comes down to this.

01:32:50.200 --> 01:32:54.720
If MPQ matches me on this one, he's walking away with a CD.

01:32:54.720 --> 01:32:57.720
If nobody matches me or Siggy matches it,

01:32:57.720 --> 01:33:02.360
Siggy's walking away with that CD. They were shocked to hear Dark Sakura called

01:33:02.360 --> 01:33:03.800
the Roseville Golf Land pads

01:33:03.800 --> 01:33:09.520
a sorrier time than staying at home watching the Paris Hilton porn,

01:33:09.520 --> 01:33:14.160
making Siggy our winner by a half-point.

01:33:14.160 --> 01:33:21.760
So if you want the CD, send me an email, or actually PM me your address and I will mail it to you.

01:33:21.760 --> 01:33:27.760
No, no. Watching the Paris Hilton video is not that sorry of a time. It is rather entertaining.

01:33:27.760 --> 01:33:32.960
So Siggy, you're our winner, and you're going to win that Resident Evil 4 sampler, and you know what?

01:33:32.960 --> 01:33:37.760
I'm actually kind of glad you won it, because now you'll be able to tell the difference between Resident Evil and Silent Hill.

01:33:37.760 --> 01:33:46.760
So, thanks for playing! Any victory speech you want to give?

01:33:46.760 --> 01:33:49.760
Well, not much, but I got some latest.

01:33:49.760 --> 01:33:52.760
Oh, sure. Oh, some actual news on this show?

01:33:52.760 --> 01:33:53.760
Yup.

01:33:53.760 --> 01:33:55.760
The hell? Alright, what's up? What's up, Ziggy?

01:33:55.760 --> 01:34:04.760
Meet me at GDX9 Style CS. It has been confirmed that number 13 by Taka, respect for JSB, is going to be included on the song list.

01:34:04.760 --> 01:34:07.760
That song is, that song is, like, frickin' hard, too.

01:34:07.760 --> 01:34:08.760
Yeah.

01:34:08.760 --> 01:34:09.760
Ooh.

01:34:09.760 --> 01:34:10.760
Interesting.

01:34:10.760 --> 01:34:11.760
How about, uh, 2DX Red?

01:34:11.760 --> 01:34:12.760
Any, um...

01:34:12.760 --> 01:34:15.760
Well, nothing much on 2DX Red.

01:34:15.760 --> 01:34:16.760
Hmm.

01:34:16.760 --> 01:34:20.760
Well, I'd like to see, cause if there were some Red unlocks in 8 style, then maybe they'd

01:34:20.760 --> 01:34:21.760
be nice enough to put something...

01:34:21.760 --> 01:34:24.760
The last unlocked one was for the, uh, Scorpion Fire.

01:34:24.760 --> 01:34:25.760
Oh, okay.

01:34:25.760 --> 01:34:26.760
Well.

01:34:26.760 --> 01:34:31.360
All right, well, how about, do we know anything else about consumer tracks for 9 style yet?

01:34:31.360 --> 01:34:32.760
Cause that's what I'm curious about.

01:34:32.760 --> 01:34:35.260
Well, that's the only one confirmed, number 13.

01:34:35.260 --> 01:34:38.260
Well, that's something. But we've already heard number 13. We know that song.

01:34:38.260 --> 01:34:39.260
Yeah.

01:34:39.260 --> 01:34:42.260
Even if you don't, I will play number 13 in a future break.

01:34:42.260 --> 01:34:48.260
And, just for the record, Siggy, before we let you go, any response to the chatroom?

01:34:48.260 --> 01:34:51.260
They're teasing you on your laugh. Do you have anything you want to say in response to that?

01:34:51.260 --> 01:34:56.260
Well, I don't care what these people say. I just like to laugh the way I want to.

01:34:56.260 --> 01:35:01.260
That's, you preach on. Don't give a crap what our chatroom says. We sure don't, alright?

01:35:01.260 --> 01:35:09.260
Yeah. Oh, by the way, the song A and AA, they're actually pronounced as Ace and Double Ace.

01:35:09.260 --> 01:35:14.260
Ace and Double Ace. Oh, like a deck of cards, Ace and Double Ace. I get it.

01:35:14.260 --> 01:35:21.260
I like A and AA. Screw that. I'm gonna call it A and AA.

01:35:21.260 --> 01:35:24.260
Remember, EDR is the thirteenth step.

01:35:24.260 --> 01:35:27.260
Or A and A.

01:35:27.260 --> 01:35:29.260
Ah!

01:35:29.260 --> 01:35:32.620
Alright, thanks for the call, Siggy. Congratulations on your win.

01:35:32.620 --> 01:35:34.620
Email, you got Jamie's email, right?

01:35:34.620 --> 01:35:37.620
Yeah, yeah, I'll just send a private message.

01:35:37.620 --> 01:35:39.620
Okay, he'll send a private message.

01:35:39.620 --> 01:35:40.620
Yeah, I'm in the chatroom right now.

01:35:40.620 --> 01:35:41.620
Alright. Sounds good!

01:35:41.620 --> 01:35:42.620
Alright.

01:35:42.620 --> 01:35:43.620
Congratulations, man.

01:35:43.620 --> 01:35:44.620
Thank you, Sky!

01:35:44.620 --> 01:35:46.620
No problem, good job. Bye.

01:35:46.620 --> 01:35:50.620
Actually, to be accurate, according to Dennis, Larry Nyquil is the thirteenth step.

01:35:50.620 --> 01:35:55.620
When I hear the word ace, I can't help but think of...

01:35:55.620 --> 01:36:01.620
of, um, what was that, Wild Zero? Or whatever?

01:36:01.620 --> 01:36:02.620
What?

01:36:02.620 --> 01:36:08.620
Or, not Wild Zero, um, that stupid zombie movie. Remember?

01:36:08.620 --> 01:36:10.620
I have no idea what you're talking about right now.

01:36:10.620 --> 01:36:11.620
That was Wild Zero.

01:36:11.620 --> 01:36:12.620
Yeah, it was Wild Zero.

01:36:12.620 --> 01:36:14.620
I got you the soundtrack, the record for that.

01:36:14.620 --> 01:36:15.620
Ace!

01:36:15.620 --> 01:36:17.620
I do remember that, I have that still.

01:36:17.620 --> 01:36:19.620
Who was that, Guitar Wolf?

01:36:19.620 --> 01:36:20.620
Guitar Wolf, that was it.

01:36:20.620 --> 01:36:22.620
Ace!

01:36:22.620 --> 01:36:25.620
Okay, I'm lost. That's alright.

01:36:25.620 --> 01:36:30.620
Every time I hear Ace, I start thinking of this line from Red Dwarf.

01:36:30.620 --> 01:36:33.620
Your nickname was never Ace, maybe Acehole.

01:36:33.620 --> 01:36:36.620
You're an Acehole.

01:36:36.620 --> 01:36:44.620
I don't know if anybody in here watched a lot of Red Dwarf, but Remor always called himself Ace.

01:36:44.620 --> 01:36:48.620
Finally, Lister told him off and said that his nickname was Acehole.

01:36:48.620 --> 01:37:01.620
Alright. Um, we're gonna go to break, and in this break we're gonna hear, I just, I will play some number 13, and we'll play some Ace as well, or as I like to say it, Ahh! Ahh!

01:37:01.620 --> 01:37:12.620
So we'll play that, and then we're gonna do the, um, cage match when we come back, and, uh, I, I do wanna talk about one non-Baumani piece of video game news, even though it's not the podcast,

01:37:12.620 --> 01:37:17.340
There's just something that went in the news this week that is just too damn

01:37:17.340 --> 01:37:21.820
funny for us not to pass up. And especially with this many of us that

01:37:21.820 --> 01:37:25.880
play MMORPGs. So you know we're gonna talk about this. I'll teach you with that.

01:37:25.880 --> 01:37:31.040
We'll be back after this with more Orange Launch Radio.

01:38:25.880 --> 01:38:27.880
I hope you enjoyed this video.

01:38:27.880 --> 01:38:29.880
If you did, please subscribe to my channel.

01:39:29.880 --> 01:39:31.880
You

01:43:29.880 --> 01:43:59.800
We are back here on Orange Lawn's radio, and Jamie's spreading the inside joke love.

01:43:59.800 --> 01:44:07.040
here in the studio this is an old joke from under sedation live I know you know

01:44:07.040 --> 01:44:10.520
wasn't that reunion show supposed to happen like soon it's this eventually

01:44:10.520 --> 01:44:16.480
okay but um this was back when mint skittles came out right and Travis was

01:44:16.480 --> 01:44:22.200
joking about the making mint scattles to make your but be minty fresh yes okay

01:44:22.200 --> 01:44:26.120
and I made a label you actually made the label and photo or paint shop pro I'm

01:44:26.120 --> 01:44:28.920
sorry I forgot you're not a Photoshop girl I have to use Photoshop and I hate

01:44:28.920 --> 01:44:34.160
it okay anyway we are back here on orange we are gonna get into the cage

01:44:34.160 --> 01:44:37.280
match rather shortly but I had to talk about this story that came up because

01:44:37.280 --> 01:44:41.240
it's just too dang good and it's actually something that was posted to

01:44:41.240 --> 01:44:44.480
our website earlier this week so if you stay on top of our website you've

01:44:44.480 --> 01:44:53.240
already read this but if you don't we're gonna read it again basically it has to

01:44:53.240 --> 01:44:57.320
do with ever quest to now I know that that's an MMORPG that none of us play

01:44:57.320 --> 01:45:02.000
We're mostly Final Fantasy XI addicts. Maybe, maybe some of us have dabbled in

01:45:02.000 --> 01:45:05.600
the World of Warcraft. I know Jamie was big on Ragnarok. I was too for a little

01:45:05.600 --> 01:45:09.400
while. So some various ones. EverQuest isn't one we've really touched, but it is

01:45:09.400 --> 01:45:12.560
a big one. It's a big one. I know people are really into EverQuest. Well, they're

01:45:12.560 --> 01:45:17.660
gonna add a new command line feature into EverQuest 2. You know how you can

01:45:17.660 --> 01:45:23.560
slash say, slash, you know, fight. You type in the little command slash whatever. Well

01:45:23.560 --> 01:45:29.860
they're putting a new one into EverQuest 2. It's called slash pizza and if you type

01:45:29.860 --> 01:45:34.980
slash pizza it'll actually open up a little web browser right on top of your

01:45:34.980 --> 01:45:40.040
EverQuest 2 screen and take it directly to Pizza Hut.com where you can order a

01:45:40.040 --> 01:45:45.420
pizza and have it delivered right to your home so that you can play EverQuest

01:45:45.420 --> 01:45:52.480
all night long. That's fucking sad. This is exactly why I wanted to bring this up

01:45:52.480 --> 01:45:54.480
What the fuck?

01:46:02.480 --> 01:46:03.480
No.

01:46:04.480 --> 01:46:10.480
Because if I'm hungry, I can go into the kitchen and cook some food.

01:46:11.480 --> 01:46:16.480
If I wanted to go out to eat, my ass would log out and go out to eat.

01:46:16.480 --> 01:46:20.480
eat. Because guess what? There's real people out in the world.

01:46:20.480 --> 01:46:24.480
But you've had pizza delivered to you before, right? Maybe once in a while?

01:46:24.480 --> 01:46:28.480
Yeah, but not like because I was too lazy to log my ass off the damn game and go get it.

01:46:28.480 --> 01:46:32.480
Right, you order pizza because, you know, you want...

01:46:32.480 --> 01:46:36.480
I was too lazy to go get away from my movie and go get it.

01:46:36.480 --> 01:46:40.480
Exactly, exactly. The sad thing is, I know people

01:46:40.480 --> 01:46:44.480
that will use, I would probably use this quite a bit if they

01:46:44.480 --> 01:46:49.940
this in Final Fantasy XI, but at the same time, that would probably be the point where

01:46:49.940 --> 01:46:56.440
I'd have to say, oh my god, Rob, look at yourself, should I be happy if we had a Pizza Hut near

01:46:56.440 --> 01:47:03.200
us? That's true, we don't even have a Pizza Hut in town. The pizza place closest to my

01:47:03.200 --> 01:47:08.200
house is actually Round Table. Well, right, so even if they built this in Final Fantasy

01:47:08.200 --> 01:47:11.840
We wouldn't be able to use it if we could only pay for those pizzas in Gil

01:47:14.960 --> 01:47:20.240
That's the next thing we're moving to what if you could pay for the pizza using the online game currency

01:47:20.240 --> 01:47:22.240
How sad would that be?

01:47:22.400 --> 01:47:28.120
Or like if you order the pizza, then your character gets like, you know a vitality up or something

01:47:30.080 --> 01:47:35.360
Maximum hit points have increased because you ordered Pizza Hut. Is this where advertising is going?

01:47:35.360 --> 01:47:40.360
I mean, order Taco Bell and receive Bio Effect.

01:47:46.360 --> 01:47:51.360
No, and if you like, order from Del Taco, you get the Dia one.

01:47:52.360 --> 01:47:55.360
You mean diarrhea? Is that what's okay?

01:47:55.360 --> 01:47:57.360
Alright, order anything ho-

01:48:01.360 --> 01:48:03.360
Order anything hot so as to cast fire.

01:48:04.360 --> 01:48:06.360
Actually, Ferraga, sorry.

01:48:06.360 --> 01:48:10.360
Your ass begins casting fire on Little Goblin.

01:48:12.360 --> 01:48:14.360
Wow, that's amazing.

01:48:18.360 --> 01:48:20.360
What other slash features do you think-

01:48:20.360 --> 01:48:22.360
First slash pizza, what's next?

01:48:22.360 --> 01:48:24.360
Slash blowjob? Get a hooker?

01:48:24.360 --> 01:48:29.360
You get a hooker to come to your house and have sex with you because nobody else will because you play EverQuest all day?

01:48:29.360 --> 01:48:34.360
No, you'd order an in-game prostitute.

01:48:34.360 --> 01:48:42.360
So I would like to just, I would just like to kind of humor that question. What other type of slash features would you like to see in EverQuest?

01:48:42.360 --> 01:48:46.360
Yeah, this might make a good list list later on. We'll have to see.

01:48:46.360 --> 01:48:55.360
I think a good one would be slash exercise, where when you type it in, the game shuts down, and your computer shuts off, and it won't let you turn it on for 50 minutes.

01:48:55.360 --> 01:49:00.360
So you have to go out and exercise.

01:49:00.360 --> 01:49:05.360
Yes, yes, you can see my computer has gone into that feature right now.

01:49:05.360 --> 01:49:11.360
Apparently you typed it in earlier, Loki.

01:49:41.360 --> 01:49:48.360
So that they would make the muscles contract and expand to the point that it gets tired

01:49:48.360 --> 01:49:53.160
out as though you had exercised it, and that's all that that ab thing is.

01:49:53.160 --> 01:49:55.620
So it just makes you feel like you've exercised it?

01:49:55.620 --> 01:49:56.620
Sort of.

01:49:56.620 --> 01:49:59.680
It's just to wear out the muscles to the point it would relax, because for me it was hitting

01:49:59.680 --> 01:50:00.680
the nerve.

01:50:00.680 --> 01:50:01.680
That sounds painful.

01:50:01.680 --> 01:50:02.680
It's not.

01:50:02.680 --> 01:50:03.680
I could never put one of those things on.

01:50:03.680 --> 01:50:04.680
It's light electricity.

01:50:04.680 --> 01:50:12.400
But they also do that for patients who have to keep the muscles from atrophy.

01:50:12.400 --> 01:50:15.720
Isn't that like how Spider-Man became Spider-Man?

01:50:15.720 --> 01:50:18.840
No, you got bit by a damn radioactive spider.

01:50:18.840 --> 01:50:22.240
Well, radioactive spider, radioactive ab belt, same thing.

01:50:22.240 --> 01:50:25.800
It's not radioactive, it's electricity.

01:50:25.800 --> 01:50:28.640
Close enough.

01:50:28.640 --> 01:50:31.480
Alright.

01:50:31.480 --> 01:50:40.480
I guess we'll get into the Orange Lawns Radio Cage Match since all those jokes are dead and gone now.

01:50:40.480 --> 01:50:43.480
I agree with Elmo. There needs to be a slash slash.

01:50:43.480 --> 01:50:54.480
Except they said, for me, what are you implying? That I can't write my own erotic stories offline? Please.

01:50:54.480 --> 01:51:02.880
please. Alright, let's get into tonight's cage match boys and girls. The way the cage

I know that you like what I do No need to put up a fight

01:53:00.520 --> 01:53:03.520
Watching you from far away, you look so sweet and clueless

01:53:03.520 --> 01:53:06.520
Soon I'll move in on my prey, it's time for me to do this

01:53:20.520 --> 01:53:22.520
Watching and waiting

01:53:23.520 --> 01:53:25.520
The feeling you're feeling

01:53:26.520 --> 01:53:28.520
Live in my time

01:53:28.520 --> 01:53:34.520
Yeah, I know that you're soon to be mine

01:53:37.520 --> 01:53:38.520
Soon to be mine

01:53:41.520 --> 01:53:47.520
Can't let you see me

01:53:47.520 --> 01:53:49.520
I'm on a stakeout

01:53:50.520 --> 01:53:52.520
I'm on a stakeout

01:53:52.520 --> 01:54:03.520
Alright, that's our returning champion, Freezepop, with Stake Out. It is up against two new songs

01:54:03.520 --> 01:54:08.260
this week, starting off with a song that Jamie picked, and it actually looks like one I've

01:54:08.260 --> 01:54:13.800
heard before, but not in this. I don't remember the name of the song, I just picked it. It's

01:54:13.800 --> 01:54:19.560
the filter in Crystal Method, and I don't remember the name of the song. It's called

01:54:19.560 --> 01:54:24.120
can't you trip like I do yes yes and it was actually a popular song several

01:54:24.120 --> 01:54:27.880
years ago but we'll see on soundtrack it was on the spawn soundtrack that's right

01:54:27.880 --> 01:54:30.960
I didn't know that I just like the song that's all right there's hey there's

01:54:30.960 --> 01:54:33.600
nothing hey I put a top boy I put Gwen Stefani in and it ended up getting

01:54:33.600 --> 01:54:35.840
retired there's nothing wrong with putting a popular song in. Who swore they

01:54:35.840 --> 01:54:39.640
picked this song as a cadence like way earlier. No you picked a crystal

01:54:39.640 --> 01:54:43.640
you picked crystal method before but never for this one. Who the hell cares

01:54:43.640 --> 01:54:46.680
anyway we can't remember it it doesn't matter. That's right if we don't remember then it

01:54:46.680 --> 01:54:53.680
Alright, here it is. Song number two, tonight's cage match, Filter and Crystal Method. Can't you trip like I do?

01:55:16.680 --> 01:55:29.680
I got the peace of mind of a killer soul I got the rationale of a New York cop

01:55:29.680 --> 01:55:38.680
I got the patience of a chopping block, yeah Just like I do

01:55:38.680 --> 01:55:40.680
I'm a nerd, I'm a nerd

01:55:41.680 --> 01:55:43.680
Just like I do

01:55:44.680 --> 01:55:45.680
I'm a nerd

01:55:56.680 --> 01:55:59.680
I've got the acumen, I don't know

01:55:59.680 --> 01:56:01.680
But season will grow

01:56:01.680 --> 01:56:04.680
I've got the black or stay

01:56:04.680 --> 01:56:07.680
Of a billion souls

01:56:07.680 --> 01:56:12.980
I got the world down my back, but I don't seem to care

01:56:12.980 --> 01:56:18.680
I got the comprehension of the world, but where, yeah

01:56:18.680 --> 01:56:21.680
Just like I do

01:56:21.680 --> 01:56:24.680
Just like I do

01:56:24.680 --> 01:56:26.680
Just like I do

01:56:29.680 --> 01:56:32.680
Just like I do

01:56:32.680 --> 01:57:00.680
Can't do, can't do, trippin' I do Can't do, can't do, trippin' I do

01:57:00.680 --> 01:57:04.680
Down on my back I can't sleep cause I'm forming

01:57:04.680 --> 01:57:08.680
Eyes in my teeth I can't see cause I'm eating

01:57:08.680 --> 01:57:12.680
Cash for the noise I can't think cause it's crushing

01:57:12.680 --> 01:57:16.680
Back on my feet like a freight train I'm going

01:57:16.680 --> 01:57:24.680
Can everybody feel like I do?

01:57:24.680 --> 01:57:47.680
Can't you, can't you strip back at you Can't you, can't you strip back at you

01:57:54.680 --> 01:58:23.680
Can't fix it, can't fix it, can't you feel it again?

01:58:24.680 --> 01:58:28.680
Can't you walk in two regions just like us?

01:58:28.680 --> 01:58:36.680
Can't you walk in two regions just like us?

01:58:36.680 --> 01:58:52.680
Can't you walk in two regions just like us?

01:59:22.680 --> 01:59:27.960
girls in studio thought of that one that was can't strip like i do can you trip it jamie

01:59:27.960 --> 01:59:35.400
i like that song so it gets a nine explicit i like the drums in the actual song it's a

01:59:35.400 --> 01:59:41.840
pretty good song but i don't know the voice kind of i don't know it's i say 8.5 8.5 low-key

01:59:41.840 --> 01:59:49.920
this song is old i used to play this song um while playing qsar so um it gets the nine

01:59:49.920 --> 01:59:54.920
I like Satan on there, that was my favorite one.

01:59:54.920 --> 01:59:55.920
You would.

01:59:55.920 --> 01:59:56.920
Angel?

01:59:56.920 --> 02:00:01.920
Nine chocolate covered pants, I mean, um, nine.

02:00:01.920 --> 02:00:02.920
Okay.

02:00:02.920 --> 02:00:06.920
And I give it, I know, I know, I give it, um, it's like one of those songs like it starts

02:00:06.920 --> 02:00:10.920
off really really cool and then as it goes on I'm kind of like, alright, time to end.

02:00:10.920 --> 02:00:12.920
But I still like it, it's groovy.

02:00:12.920 --> 02:00:15.920
I give it like a 7.5.

02:00:15.920 --> 02:00:16.920
Alright.

02:00:16.920 --> 02:00:17.920
Loki, your turn.

02:00:17.920 --> 02:00:22.920
Number three tonight is by you. What'd you pick? Well, it's not by you, but you picked it.

02:00:22.920 --> 02:00:36.920
Well, this song, I don't really know how to describe this song. This song is just different. It's one of those things I found on Amazon, searching for free music.

02:00:36.920 --> 02:00:44.080
and it's just catchy I don't know a lot of people aren't gonna like it but you

02:00:44.080 --> 02:00:48.640
know I like I've been listening to my car it's just catchy and apparently it

02:00:48.640 --> 02:00:56.040
it was it's a I guess on the charts over in India because that's you know it's an

02:00:56.040 --> 02:01:02.760
Indian artist that DJ Sishar did the remix of it and from a movie I

02:01:02.760 --> 02:01:06.160
can't remember what the movie is called though I think it's like Tamil or

02:01:06.160 --> 02:01:07.260
something like that

02:01:07.260 --> 02:01:09.560
but uh...

02:01:09.560 --> 02:01:10.840
i don't know

02:01:10.840 --> 02:01:13.880
but yeah it it's a very

02:01:13.880 --> 02:01:15.880
it's an interesting song

02:01:15.880 --> 02:01:20.760
trampy dancy, it's got a little bit of guitar. Can you pronounce this name?

02:01:20.760 --> 02:01:25.120
uh... i think it's pronounced like uh... kekakekka or something. Well that's the artist

02:01:25.120 --> 02:01:29.880
kekakekka. Kekakekka is the artist. It's the Tamils song, it's the name of the actual song.

02:01:29.880 --> 02:01:32.160
It says in the title, it says

02:01:32.160 --> 02:01:37.680
you and i apologize profusely to um... everybody in the movie it's from

02:01:37.680 --> 02:01:38.520
it

02:01:38.520 --> 02:01:42.640
it's the movie that's from union urea union urea looks like you're in your

02:01:42.640 --> 02:01:45.520
except that the movie that's well-paid camel is

02:01:45.520 --> 02:01:48.080
the language i think it's both in it

02:01:48.080 --> 02:01:48.560
it

02:01:48.560 --> 02:01:52.440
uh... it's the title song for that movie that's remix by the state of the

02:01:52.440 --> 02:01:54.320
citizen of the art of the cake

02:01:54.320 --> 02:01:58.900
take a kick there were a pj sitar makes the remixing take a caca

02:01:58.900 --> 02:02:02.000

02:02:42.000 --> 02:02:47.000

02:02:47.000 --> 02:02:52.000
music

02:02:52.000 --> 02:02:57.000
music

02:07:27.000 --> 02:07:29.000
Three, two, one, back

02:07:57.000 --> 02:08:04.000
all

02:08:08.940 --> 02:08:11.280
right we are back and that was

02:08:11.280 --> 02:08:15.260
kicka kicka DJ sit are three mixin and a song we

02:08:15.260 --> 02:08:18.680
I believe and I apologize again for butchering absolutely butchering the

02:08:18.680 --> 02:08:19.440
pronunciation is

02:08:19.440 --> 02:08:23.900
the urine you re let's see what you guys think

02:08:23.900 --> 02:08:32.440
Jamie Dark Sakura and a half from Dark Sakura explicit that's pretty good but

02:08:32.440 --> 02:08:36.140
some reason I didn't like the beginning too much but once again to the actual

02:08:36.140 --> 02:08:43.660
music yeah 8.5 8.5 from explicit Loki I love the backbeat for that song that was

02:08:43.660 --> 02:08:46.980
one of the things about DJ Siddharth even his other stuff that he has is

02:08:46.980 --> 02:08:51.340
really good beats to all of it why he chose I mean I understand why he chose

02:08:51.340 --> 02:08:59.340
remix that song to be you know an indian dj so i mean it makes sense but um it was i don't know i

02:08:59.340 --> 02:09:04.860
i if i understood the vocals i'm sure it'd make more sense or if i heard the original song it

02:09:04.860 --> 02:09:09.660
makes more sense to me but since i didn't you know i gave it a nine though it's decent but

02:09:09.660 --> 02:09:16.700
it probably's annoying to a lot of people angels i liked it a lot just like uh another

02:09:16.700 --> 02:09:24.260
other Indian artist that I heard, it kind of just reminded me of that. So, I'll be nice.

02:09:24.260 --> 02:09:27.380
I'll give it a nine.

02:09:27.380 --> 02:09:30.460
I actually surprisingly liked that song quite a bit. I just think it needed some of the

02:09:30.460 --> 02:09:34.500
fat trimmed from it, like the beginning was a little slow and there's some parts that

02:09:34.500 --> 02:09:37.220
could have been cut, because that song was over six minutes, well, just about over six

02:09:37.220 --> 02:09:41.620
minutes. And I think it could have been cut down a little bit, a little more compact,

02:09:41.620 --> 02:09:44.900
about four minutes probably would have been good. Otherwise though, I do like the beat.

02:09:44.900 --> 02:09:47.180
I like kind of what they remixed there. That's pretty cool

02:09:47.180 --> 02:09:50.740
I understand though why it has the big beginning because it's probably meant for

02:09:51.420 --> 02:09:53.420
Mixing in to your normal. Yeah

02:09:53.580 --> 02:09:57.600
But as far as you know playing it by itself, it kind of hurts it for that

02:09:57.600 --> 02:09:59.620
So I give it an eight and a half though. It was still a good song

02:09:59.940 --> 02:10:04.020
All right, which is surprising that I liked yet another Loki's caveman song

02:10:04.020 --> 02:10:05.700
You know the one you put in a couple weeks ago

02:10:05.700 --> 02:10:09.820
I've been listening to a ton in my car and I thought the echoing green one

02:10:09.820 --> 02:10:14.260
and I actually downloaded you know what the funny thing about that echo image

02:10:14.260 --> 02:10:18.260
because you said it sounded like them echo image actually remixed that song

02:10:18.260 --> 02:10:21.900
it's available on iTunes I actually used one of my free songs for it but here's

02:10:21.900 --> 02:10:26.220
the thing it sucks it really sucks I was so sad

02:10:26.220 --> 02:10:31.500
like good song good band this is gonna be awesome sucks oh anyway back to the

02:10:31.500 --> 02:10:36.620
issue at hand here let's recap the three songs you can vote for tonight song

02:10:36.620 --> 02:10:46.620
Song number one, last week's winner, Freezepop, Stakeout.

02:10:46.620 --> 02:10:50.360
And song number two you can vote for tonight, Filter and the Crystal Method, Can't You Trip

02:10:50.360 --> 02:10:59.940
Like I Do?

02:10:59.940 --> 02:11:03.100
I had to pick the quietest part of that song by random there, whoops.

02:11:03.100 --> 02:11:07.500
Keka Keka, a remix by DJ Siddharth, is song number three, Urine Urie.

02:11:07.500 --> 02:11:22.500
Alright guys, place vote now. Send a private message to Sky in the chatroom with your vote

02:11:22.500 --> 02:11:28.540
and the winning song will be in rotation all week long. And it will be your fault too.

02:11:28.540 --> 02:11:31.540
Send a private message to Sky right now with your vote. Meanwhile,

02:11:31.540 --> 02:11:36.040
you know, I was just thinking this week about song pack number 8

02:11:36.040 --> 02:11:41.140
on the Xbox and... Is that ever gonna come out? I don't know. I'm starting to worry.

02:11:41.140 --> 02:11:44.380
It's still not out. What in the hell is going on?

02:11:44.380 --> 02:11:48.260
Somebody needs to get bitch slapped and I don't think it's Konami. I think it's

02:11:48.260 --> 02:11:49.380
somebody at Microsoft.

02:11:49.380 --> 02:11:52.900
I guess they're too busy concerning themselves with the Xboxes that caught

02:11:52.900 --> 02:11:54.740
on fire or something. I don't know.

02:11:54.740 --> 02:11:58.940
Because you heard about this, right? The Microsoft had to recall

02:11:58.940 --> 02:12:02.420
the power cords for Xboxes that were made

02:12:02.420 --> 02:12:07.380
prior to October 2003 because I guess if you leave it on for a prolonged period

02:12:07.380 --> 02:12:08.140
of time

02:12:08.140 --> 02:12:15.140
it will catch fire. They say it's only a one in ten thousand chance but you know

02:12:15.460 --> 02:12:18.660
those types of lawsuits are still pretty big deal so they gotta recall

02:12:18.660 --> 02:12:22.980
and they'll send you a free power cord. I got an email on it although I believe

02:12:22.980 --> 02:12:30.680
My particular Xbox is immune because it's a Halo Xbox. I got the Halo limited edition. I don't think it affects these.

02:12:30.680 --> 02:12:35.680
I still got an email on it because they suspect it. I don't know. I got to check it out at least.

02:12:35.680 --> 02:12:39.680
Any comments on this? Anything you guys have heard? Extra on this?

02:12:39.680 --> 02:12:43.680
Our first Xbox already died, so it's kind of moot for me.

02:12:43.680 --> 02:12:49.980
That's, yeah, I guess that's what I hear is that the Xboxes don't last too long usually.

02:12:49.980 --> 02:12:54.060
so here's the email I got it says Microsoft has chosen to replace the

02:12:54.060 --> 02:13:00.140
power cords on Xbox console manufactured before October 23rd 2003 our records

02:13:00.140 --> 02:13:03.740
indicate that you may own one of these consoles hey that's me check the

02:13:03.740 --> 02:13:07.180
manufacturer date on the bottom of your console no action is necessary if your

02:13:07.180 --> 02:13:12.420
console is manufactured on or after October 23rd 2003 now I'm all curious

02:13:12.420 --> 02:13:18.420
Loki's gonna look look he's gonna go look at that manufacture date I thought

02:13:18.420 --> 02:13:23.420
I thought I bought mine after that, but I guess that doesn't mean it was manufactured after that day, necessarily.

02:13:23.420 --> 02:13:26.420
We'll see.

02:13:26.420 --> 02:13:30.420
I actually didn't know about that, but okay.

02:13:30.420 --> 02:13:35.420
You know what's sad is that must have actually happened for them to realize it.

02:13:35.420 --> 02:13:37.420
What the hell, April 16th?

02:13:37.420 --> 02:13:42.420
Yep, my Xbox was made April 16th, 2004. I am immune, motherfucker.

02:13:42.420 --> 02:13:45.420
That's the same, that's my birthday.

02:13:45.420 --> 02:13:50.420
Yes. Right on. Yeah, that's the exact date of my birthday. I was like, what the...

02:13:50.420 --> 02:13:54.420
Hey, that's cool. Oh well. Yeah, I haven't had my Xbox that long.

02:13:54.420 --> 02:13:57.420
Because those Halo ones just came out, so.

02:13:57.420 --> 02:14:02.420
I should get a new cord anyway, just because they're really expensive otherwise.

02:14:02.420 --> 02:14:05.420
Oh yeah, just get it for free, since they're...

02:14:07.420 --> 02:14:11.420
You know, fixing the problem, according to what they're saying.

02:14:11.420 --> 02:14:14.420
When did this happen though? I didn't hear about this.

02:14:14.420 --> 02:14:20.420
It's just this week. Xbox sent out all the emails to people this week. So check your Xboxes, kids.

02:14:20.420 --> 02:14:26.420
If you have an Xbox that was manufactured before October 23rd, 2003, you better get a new power corridor.

02:14:26.420 --> 02:14:28.420
There might be a fire! A bad fire!

02:14:28.420 --> 02:14:30.420
Fry-cro-soft.

02:14:30.420 --> 02:14:33.420
Fry-cro-soft. Alright.

02:14:33.420 --> 02:14:42.420
One other thing I wanted to bring up, it's not really Brumani related per se, but I think this is pretty cool and needs to be discussed.

02:14:42.420 --> 02:14:48.620
discussed, is that a new game has been announced. Games are Fun ran the story on this, and they

02:14:48.620 --> 02:14:55.260
got some screenshots from Mario Kart GP. And guys, this is not a new console game, this

02:14:55.260 --> 02:15:02.180
is a new arcade game. Mario Kart arcade. Discussed. Bitch, is you all going down? It's gonna have

02:15:02.180 --> 02:15:06.180
Pac-Man and Ms. Pac-Man in it, and it's put up by Namco. Yep, because Namco and Nintendo

02:15:06.180 --> 02:15:10.140
teamed up for this. Here's the thing I'm wondering, and it's the thing that I've been wondering

02:15:10.140 --> 02:15:18.660
a while. It's on Triforce hardware. Triforce, three companies. Namco, Nintendo, and Sega.

02:15:18.660 --> 02:15:23.540
Yes, Sega being the one. Where are the Sega characters? Yeah, that's a good question.

02:15:23.540 --> 02:15:27.780
You know, Sega has better things they could be doing, like putting out another Knight's

02:15:27.780 --> 02:15:33.140
game. Damn it. But, come on, having Sonic in Mario Kart, wouldn't that be the weirdest

02:15:33.140 --> 02:15:39.500
thing ever? God, I shouldn't have a car. I guess that's a good point. Okay, so Sonic

02:15:39.500 --> 02:15:42.880
And it would be like in Sonic R.

02:15:42.880 --> 02:15:46.120
Sonic does not get a car.

02:15:46.120 --> 02:15:50.280
Sonic does not get a car.

02:15:50.280 --> 02:15:51.760
How much do you wanna bet?

02:15:51.760 --> 02:15:56.640
This is gonna be tied in with either another Mario Kart game that's gonna be released for

02:15:56.640 --> 02:16:02.060
the like the GameCube or the new console.

02:16:02.060 --> 02:16:06.120
Yeah, because it looks like you know, cuz that was the way F-Zero worked, is that it

02:16:06.120 --> 02:16:13.560
kind of teamed up with one one of the home versions there so it should be a

02:16:13.560 --> 02:16:21.640
card game you can save your progress anyway it looks very cool it does have

02:16:21.640 --> 02:16:25.160
actually it does have the card and Mario Kart is supposed to have the card system

02:16:25.160 --> 02:16:31.520
with it very good just like f-zero did you know what huh I'm very it's very

02:16:31.520 --> 02:16:35.760
interesting that they're using so many card games now you know back when the

02:16:35.760 --> 02:16:38.560
The Neo Geo's were first kind of big.

02:16:38.560 --> 02:16:39.560
God, I remember those.

02:16:39.560 --> 02:16:41.260
They were supposed to have it.

02:16:41.260 --> 02:16:47.060
And I remember watching this back on, um, what was the, what was the show?

02:16:47.060 --> 02:16:48.960
It was the GamePro show.

02:16:48.960 --> 02:16:50.520
Oh, God.

02:16:50.520 --> 02:16:53.560
You know the GamePro show was filmed locally here in this area?

02:16:53.560 --> 02:16:55.760
Oh, I lived in Alabama at the time.

02:16:55.760 --> 02:16:57.480
Well, yeah, it was filmed at the Channel 3 studios.

02:16:57.480 --> 02:16:58.480
Isn't that weird?

02:16:58.480 --> 02:17:02.520
But I remember where, um, you were supposed to have a memory card that worked from your

02:17:02.520 --> 02:17:05.280
Neo Geo home system to the arcade systems.

02:17:05.280 --> 02:17:08.640
between the MVS and the AVS

02:17:08.640 --> 02:17:11.960
I never, and I actually saw

02:17:11.960 --> 02:17:15.400
the machine, you know you can look on the old Neo Geo machines

02:17:15.400 --> 02:17:18.720
and actually see the card readers on them. Would it be maybe that that didn't catch on

02:17:18.720 --> 02:17:22.440
because nobody owned a Neo Geo because of the price? Now granted I know you own a Neo Geo

02:17:22.440 --> 02:17:24.080
but you are an exception to the rule.

02:17:24.080 --> 02:17:27.680
That's because me and Dan are cool. Yeah, I mean you got

02:17:27.680 --> 02:17:31.000
man, it's like cheaper than buying the arcade system. Seriously!

02:17:31.000 --> 02:17:35.160
You might as well have bought the arcade system for how much that thing costs. I don't know, he'll have to correct me on this one but I think

02:17:35.160 --> 02:17:40.000
he traded a Sega CD for it but that's the thing is that really that's why it

02:17:40.000 --> 02:17:43.800
was so damn much because in a way you were getting the arcade system on your

02:17:43.800 --> 02:17:51.440
TV with the same damn thing so crazy alright we're gonna go to a break boys

02:17:51.440 --> 02:17:54.360
and girls so we can tally up the cage match votes and when we come back we're

02:17:54.360 --> 02:17:57.160
gonna get into the FUs of the week please don't send in your FUs the week

02:17:57.160 --> 02:17:59.400
just yet though I got to get the cage match out of the way and then we'll

02:17:59.400 --> 02:18:03.640
accept those I'll let you know when so whoa excuse me we will be back after

02:18:03.640 --> 02:18:07.840
this with more excuse me how unprofessional but when was the show

02:18:07.840 --> 02:18:10.840
ever professional more orange on trader we're gonna start off this break with

02:18:10.840 --> 02:18:14.120
something Jamie wanted to hear and I think this is an appropriate song

02:18:14.120 --> 02:18:19.960
considering the Xbox news we just talked about. So we'll be back after this.

02:18:44.120 --> 02:18:50.120
Realize my fire, cause I'm real

02:18:50.120 --> 02:18:52.120
No more

02:18:52.120 --> 02:18:54.120
Stayin' on the down, I'm takin' higher

02:18:54.120 --> 02:18:56.120
Feel your body burnin' whippin' by one step

02:18:56.120 --> 02:18:58.120
A little closer

02:18:58.120 --> 02:19:00.120
Turn around and shake it like you're a poster

02:19:00.120 --> 02:19:02.120
A rollercoaster

02:19:02.120 --> 02:19:04.120
About this time I'll make a suggestion

02:19:04.120 --> 02:19:06.120
Get on the dance floor and use this stretchy hip hop

02:19:06.120 --> 02:19:08.120
And when I find the spot

02:19:08.120 --> 02:19:10.120
Realize my fire

02:19:10.120 --> 02:19:22.120
Your love is my only desire Realize the fire over me

02:19:22.120 --> 02:19:29.120
Realize the fire Your love is my only desire

02:19:29.120 --> 02:19:36.120
Realize the fire over me

02:19:36.120 --> 02:19:37.120
Come on!

02:21:06.120 --> 02:21:07.120
Let's go!

02:21:07.120 --> 02:21:08.120
Let's go!

02:21:08.120 --> 02:21:09.120
Let's go!

02:21:09.120 --> 02:21:36.120
Thanks for watching!

02:21:39.120 --> 02:21:41.120
Thank you very much.

02:22:39.120 --> 02:22:41.120
Yeah

02:23:39.120 --> 02:23:41.120
I'm on fire!

02:23:41.120 --> 02:23:43.120
I'm on fire!

02:23:47.120 --> 02:23:49.120
I'm on fire!

02:23:49.120 --> 02:24:17.120
Come on, lady, come and go Come on, lady, girl, you have to write

02:24:17.120 --> 02:24:21.820
Night's a danger, not the best it's mean

02:24:21.820 --> 02:24:23.620
Yeah, rock it, rock it, rock it, rock it

02:24:23.620 --> 02:24:26.120
I'm a singer, so I'll also make my name

02:24:26.120 --> 02:24:28.120
I'll make it if you know how

02:24:28.120 --> 02:24:31.120
I like to be a person for me

02:24:31.120 --> 02:24:34.620
Night's on fire, you better, better think

02:24:34.620 --> 02:24:37.620
You better, better be in the grave to say

02:24:37.620 --> 02:24:40.620
Night's on fire, you're the lover over me

02:24:40.620 --> 02:24:43.620
You're the lover over the rock, you're never me

02:24:43.620 --> 02:24:45.620
You're a nightfall fire

02:24:45.620 --> 02:24:47.120
You've got a plan of things

02:24:47.120 --> 02:24:49.120
You've got a battle for the end of dreams

02:24:49.120 --> 02:24:50.120
To play

02:24:50.120 --> 02:24:51.620
Nightfall fire

02:24:51.620 --> 02:24:53.120
Come over for the beat

02:24:53.120 --> 02:24:54.620
Come over for the set

02:24:54.620 --> 02:24:56.620
You're a nightfall fire

02:25:01.120 --> 02:25:03.120
You're a nightfall fire

02:25:03.120 --> 02:25:15.920
Mr. Random person on the street, who by the way is not an actor, what do you think of

02:25:15.920 --> 02:25:18.220
the orange lounge being on a music and more show?

02:25:18.220 --> 02:25:25.760
The music is like being transported to just this dancing spaceship place.

02:25:25.760 --> 02:25:27.980
It's unearthly.

02:25:27.980 --> 02:25:32.520
It's like being at a club except you don't have to actually ask someone to dance.

02:25:32.520 --> 02:25:38.600
We are back here on Orange Lawns Radio, and we're going to get into the FUs of the Week.

02:25:38.600 --> 02:25:42.400
But first, boys and girls, I bet you are dying to know who won tonight's cage match.

02:25:42.400 --> 02:25:45.240
Tweet, tweet, tweet, tweet.

02:25:45.240 --> 02:25:46.240
Chirp!

02:25:46.240 --> 02:25:48.000
Sorry, we're all dead.

02:25:48.000 --> 02:25:49.000
That's right.

02:25:49.000 --> 02:25:50.000
Actually, actually.

02:25:50.000 --> 02:25:51.000
Thanks.

02:25:51.000 --> 02:25:54.960
All right, well, here it is.

02:25:54.960 --> 02:26:03.960
cage match was so close that only one vote separated a tie between two songs

02:26:03.960 --> 02:26:09.120
from the third song so one vote any other way could have swung it completely

02:26:09.120 --> 02:26:15.680
different so here are the two songs that are tied tonight song number one is

02:26:15.680 --> 02:26:26.620
freeze-pop again and song number three is the other one that tied song number

02:26:26.620 --> 02:26:32.000
two being one vote behind so in the orange lounge rules to do it states that

02:26:32.000 --> 02:26:37.560
the host whose song did not tie gets to break the tie so Jamie is it gonna be

02:26:37.560 --> 02:26:44.560
Freezepop or Tekkakekka? Freezepop. Freezepop is the winner once again!

02:26:47.240 --> 02:26:53.240
Just because I want to irritate the people who don't like it.

02:26:53.240 --> 02:26:56.320
Alright. Freezepop wins

02:26:56.320 --> 02:27:00.240
for the third week in a row. Guess what boys and girls? If it wins next week it

02:27:00.240 --> 02:27:01.920
will be the third song

02:27:01.920 --> 02:27:05.040
in Orange Lounge history to get retired

02:27:05.040 --> 02:27:09.840
from the Orange Lounge Cage Match. The other ones being Gwen Stefani, Whatcha Waitin' For

02:27:09.840 --> 02:27:13.360
and Echo Image, Come Back are the two other songs that have been retired.

02:27:15.200 --> 02:27:19.200
I can't believe that Gwen Stefani went those whole four weeks. Have you heard her new single, though?

02:27:19.760 --> 02:27:22.880
It's hot. It's totally hot. I'm gonna put it in the Cage Match later.

02:27:23.920 --> 02:27:30.000
If I was a rich girl. Anyway, sorry. You know what? That's from Fiddler on the Roof.

02:27:30.000 --> 02:27:37.200
It is, but it's awesome, and in the video they're all dressed up like pirates.

02:27:37.200 --> 02:27:41.840
Why should they be dressed up as pirates for a song that's from...

02:27:41.840 --> 02:27:42.840
Because it's MTV.

02:27:42.840 --> 02:27:48.360
It's from a play about Russian Jews.

02:27:48.360 --> 02:27:49.760
Okay?

02:27:49.760 --> 02:27:51.160
That's...

02:27:51.160 --> 02:27:53.920
Has anybody ever...

02:27:53.920 --> 02:27:57.320
I was gonna say, isn't that your girlfriend, Loki?

02:27:57.320 --> 02:27:59.320
Fiddler on the Roof?

02:27:59.320 --> 02:28:03.320
She would qualify the Russian Jew part, yes.

02:28:05.320 --> 02:28:09.320
I'm gonna start calling your girlfriend Fiddler on the Roof.

02:28:10.320 --> 02:28:15.320
When Stefani, like, now has dropped in my esteem.

02:28:15.320 --> 02:28:17.320
But she's cool!

02:28:17.320 --> 02:28:22.320
But she's being an idiot. And I don't appreciate idiots.

02:28:24.320 --> 02:28:25.320
Alright.

02:28:25.320 --> 02:28:27.320
But we need to do the effus now.

02:28:27.320 --> 02:28:32.920
Okay, and why is it that we do these FUs of the week every single week?

02:28:32.920 --> 02:28:34.920
Because of Gwen Stefani!

02:28:34.920 --> 02:28:56.260
Fuck musicians who think they can get away with taking something that was perfectly fine

02:28:56.260 --> 02:29:01.940
the way it was and completely misinterpreting it in such a horrible way.

02:29:01.940 --> 02:29:07.740
you Gwen Stefani right in your ear because your ass isn't good enough in

02:29:07.740 --> 02:29:11.120
fact your ass is probably never mind I won't say anything you know what's

02:29:11.120 --> 02:29:17.860
ironic is that she's dating a guy from a band named Bush and thank you Gavin for

02:29:17.860 --> 02:29:28.060
dating her oh damn somebody just got told that's exactly what your fiance in

02:29:28.060 --> 02:29:30.060
I mean, the chat room just said, somebody just got told.

02:29:30.060 --> 02:29:32.060
Alright, that's awesome.

02:29:32.060 --> 02:29:35.060
Um, an F.U. goes to, uh...

02:29:35.060 --> 02:29:41.060
See, I drove past an accident yesterday that was caused by an old person driving a car.

02:29:41.060 --> 02:29:48.060
They need to make people, once they hit a certain age, take a very strict driving test.

02:29:48.060 --> 02:29:54.060
Another F.U. goes towards idiots who drive SUVs.

02:29:54.060 --> 02:30:00.060
I can understand driving an SUV if you have a legitimate need for it, but...

02:30:00.060 --> 02:30:02.060
Like you go camping every week.

02:30:02.060 --> 02:30:10.060
Yeah, I can go camping. You know what? Back in the 80s, they had these things called station wagons to cart your children around in.

02:30:10.060 --> 02:30:19.060
If you're going to breed and carry other people's spawn with you, don't drive a fucking SUV, drive a station wagon.

02:30:19.060 --> 02:30:22.060
I'm going to get a hearse to cart my children around in.

02:30:22.060 --> 02:30:24.060
That'd be awesome.

02:30:24.060 --> 02:30:30.060
Another thing, don't fucking drive while you talk on your goddamn cell phone.

02:30:32.060 --> 02:30:36.060
Bad rob.

02:30:36.060 --> 02:30:40.180
I cannot wait until this is made illegal

02:30:40.180 --> 02:30:43.740
because it is proven

02:30:43.740 --> 02:30:47.420
that you drive, that you know the people in general do not pay

02:30:47.420 --> 02:30:52.060
as much attention to the road as you would if you were not talking on your cell

02:30:52.060 --> 02:30:52.540
phone

02:30:52.540 --> 02:30:55.780
you know first of all

02:30:55.780 --> 02:30:59.940
do you drive with your laptop on? Okay never mind there are people who do that

02:30:59.940 --> 02:31:01.740
If I could

02:31:01.740 --> 02:31:04.740
Cause people are fucking retards too.

02:31:04.740 --> 02:31:09.740
If we're gonna ban cell phone usage, can we ban people who put on makeup while driving then too?

02:31:09.740 --> 02:31:10.740
You know what, that...

02:31:10.740 --> 02:31:16.740
I almost got hit with someone driving with a laptop on their lap.

02:31:16.740 --> 02:31:20.740
Another thing is just people who think that they need to be one car ahead.

02:31:20.740 --> 02:31:21.740
Oh, that I hate.

02:31:21.740 --> 02:31:22.740
Oh my god, your car...

02:31:22.740 --> 02:31:26.740
And I can understand if the person is actually going 20 miles under the speed limit in front of you,

02:31:26.740 --> 02:31:28.740
because then they are a safety hazard.

02:31:28.740 --> 02:31:36.740
But if I'm going, normally I tend to speed a little bit. I drive about five to ten miles over the speed limit sometimes.

02:31:36.740 --> 02:31:53.740
But when someone passes me, no, that's just inexcusable. Nothing is, you don't need to be somewhere in so much of a hurry that you should endanger your lives and the lives of everybody else on the road.

02:31:53.740 --> 02:31:57.420
really care about the person driving, because you know what, if they die, that's Darwinism

02:31:57.420 --> 02:32:03.940
at work. You know, but when they hurt other people in the process because of their stupidity,

02:32:03.940 --> 02:32:07.620
that's where I draw the line. Now if they decide to run off the overpass into the river

02:32:07.620 --> 02:32:17.620
and they're the only ones hurt, fine. You know. Another thing is, I am bad at this,

02:32:17.620 --> 02:32:23.340
I am getting better, but I don't ride up on people's asses. You know, I do have an issue

02:32:23.340 --> 02:32:28.340
with my following distance, but I don't drive all the way up on somebody's bumper where

02:32:28.340 --> 02:32:34.860
if, you know, the person in front of me stopped, I wouldn't have any time. There was this person

02:32:34.860 --> 02:32:41.460
who was right on my ass driving home from work the other day, and I'm just glad that

02:32:41.460 --> 02:32:45.660
I had good breaks, because I actually did have to stop very quickly to avoid hitting

02:32:45.660 --> 02:32:52.660
an animal, and the person came very close to running into my rear end, so I kind of

02:32:54.020 --> 02:32:57.700
wish that they had so I could, you know, make them go through all the hassle of getting

02:32:57.700 --> 02:33:01.980
worse and, you know, having their insurance rate go up, but, you know, I had better things

02:33:01.980 --> 02:33:08.980
to do with my time. But that's really it. It's mostly about drivers.

02:33:09.180 --> 02:33:13.260
Alright, let's go on to Loki. I have one more.

02:33:13.260 --> 02:33:15.260
Okay, let's not go on to Loki.

02:33:15.260 --> 02:33:18.260
People who think that diet pills are the ways to lose weight.

02:33:18.260 --> 02:33:21.260
You know how to lose weight? Get off your ass and work it off.

02:33:23.260 --> 02:33:24.260
That's it.

02:33:24.260 --> 02:33:26.260
Okay. You sure?

02:33:26.260 --> 02:33:27.260
Alright.

02:33:27.260 --> 02:33:29.260
Alright. Loki!

02:33:29.260 --> 02:33:31.260
And dust. Fuck you, dust.

02:33:31.260 --> 02:33:34.260
Fuck you to my cold.

02:33:34.260 --> 02:33:36.260
It sucked.

02:33:36.260 --> 02:33:38.260
Still stuffed up.

02:33:38.260 --> 02:33:40.260
Been all tired.

02:33:40.260 --> 02:33:42.260
No tired. Tired bad.

02:33:42.260 --> 02:33:52.260
And, uh, fucking to my computer for being broken, because I'm gonna have withdrawals, especially now that I think I've realized that Brad hasn't returned Grand Theft Auto San Andreas yet.

02:33:52.260 --> 02:34:00.260
So I don't know what I'm gonna do now. Does that mean I have to finish playing, uh, Wind Waker? I guess so.

02:34:00.260 --> 02:34:05.260
And then, finally, the most important one of them all!

02:34:05.260 --> 02:34:09.260
Fuck you, Golf Land! Fuck you and your ugly asses!

02:34:09.260 --> 02:34:13.460
Fuck you, Keith! Fuck you, management of Golf Land and Roseville Golf Land!

02:34:13.460 --> 02:34:18.260
Thank you, cause you know, I love to be taxed on my own fucking money!

02:34:18.260 --> 02:34:21.860
Let's flashback here to the summer, when I got to build

02:34:21.860 --> 02:34:26.460
a brand new set mania cabinet for Golf Land. I did this as purely as a favor, because

02:34:26.460 --> 02:34:31.360
their sales had sucked, no one's come to the arcade, the scene had basically died.

02:34:31.360 --> 02:34:36.360
So, what was my deal with them? I would charge them for parts, they would reimburse me, the end.

02:34:36.360 --> 02:34:40.360
Okay, they would have a wonderful cabinet, I would do all the labor for free, that's it.

02:34:41.360 --> 02:34:49.360
So, a thousand dollars later, you know, I have this cabinet that's built here, they go to pay me, and they're dragging their feet.

02:34:49.360 --> 02:34:54.360
They don't wanna, you know, they're just like, oh Keith's never there, oh the check's on its way, da da da da da.

02:34:54.360 --> 02:35:00.860
so it's been dragging and dragging and finally I get paid and then they have

02:35:00.860 --> 02:35:07.440
the audacity to send me a 1099 for it a 1099 for my own money that they were

02:35:07.440 --> 02:35:11.220
supposed to be reimbursed me for why am I getting taxed on my own money fuck them

02:35:11.220 --> 02:35:20.400
fuck them um a 1098 for one that you pay taxes no 1099 are the ones they get

02:35:20.400 --> 02:35:27.120
tax on its miscellaneous income and actually I think you're meaning a w-2

02:35:27.120 --> 02:35:31.260
no it's a 1099 nobody's right it is the 1099 oh never mind you're right you're

02:35:31.260 --> 02:35:39.040
right right right w-2s are for wages I guess they also put out 1099, 1098, and

02:35:39.040 --> 02:35:45.800
5498 and W2Gs. They put out 1099s for returned funds for us I work in

02:35:45.800 --> 02:35:49.340
mortgage they put out 1099s for foreclosures and bankruptcies too. Yes because I know

02:35:49.340 --> 02:35:58.340
I know what these are because I get them from, um, our work for, you know, our fifth cards, so, you know, that's cool that we get those and stuff.

02:35:58.340 --> 02:36:05.340
So taxes! You know how much that's gonna cost me, Golf Land? That's gonna cost me $150 out of my pocket for your stupid shit.

02:36:05.340 --> 02:36:07.340
Good concept.

02:36:07.340 --> 02:36:09.340
Take them to Smockland's Court.

02:36:09.340 --> 02:36:11.340
It's really not worth it, you know? It's really not.

02:36:11.340 --> 02:36:13.340
A machine, by the way, which no longer operates.

02:36:13.340 --> 02:36:17.340
Yeah, the machine's been stolen, it's been converted back, er, you know, whatever.

02:36:17.340 --> 02:36:19.340
Take the check to Golfie to make them pay it.

02:36:19.340 --> 02:36:25.340
It's not worth it, honestly, because it was hard enough to get them to pay for it.

02:36:25.340 --> 02:36:27.340
It's not worth my time.

02:36:27.340 --> 02:36:31.340
You know what, I always say it's worth time to prove somebody wrong.

02:36:31.340 --> 02:36:38.340
No, here's the thing, the only reason they were going to have a 1099 for me before,

02:36:38.340 --> 02:36:41.340
because they said, oh well you don't have the receipts for it anymore.

02:36:41.340 --> 02:36:45.340
Bullshit, I gave those to Keith, he knew he had them, he lost them, that's it.

02:36:45.340 --> 02:36:50.020
it so I I didn't think to make copies because I didn't think it's gonna be a

02:36:50.020 --> 02:36:54.100
problem so anyway so then so they figured out way what they're gonna do is

02:36:54.100 --> 02:36:57.180
they're gonna make this fake invoice okay and make it look like I'm some

02:36:57.180 --> 02:37:00.900
computer company and then they're gonna give voices to that so I wouldn't get

02:37:00.900 --> 02:37:05.420
you know charged a 1099 port and that was the deal that was you know they

02:37:05.420 --> 02:37:08.660
made it clear that I wasn't gonna get a 1099 for it and that everything was all

02:37:08.660 --> 02:37:13.440
good and I was done well guess what they gave me a 1099 anyway go into the

02:37:13.440 --> 02:37:16.440
and take back $150 in parts out of the machine.

02:37:16.440 --> 02:37:19.440
I can't really do that.

02:37:19.440 --> 02:37:20.440
For their idiocy.

02:37:20.440 --> 02:37:22.440
Well, that'd be theft.

02:37:22.440 --> 02:37:24.440
I'd pursue it.

02:37:24.440 --> 02:37:27.440
So, yeah, they fucked me over again.

02:37:27.440 --> 02:37:33.440
Just go in there with a chocolate gun and wave it around.

02:37:33.440 --> 02:37:36.440
I sent an email to Keith, who wasn't very nice,

02:37:36.440 --> 02:37:39.440
and, you know, he hasn't responded. Surprise.

02:37:39.440 --> 02:37:41.440
Never ever responds, so, you know what, fuck him.

02:37:41.440 --> 02:37:46.440
And I'm officially, you know, I'm boycotting Golf Land, I'm not going back there ever again.

02:37:46.440 --> 02:37:51.440
And I would urge everyone else to do the same, because they're just gonna fuck everyone over, so...

02:37:51.440 --> 02:37:53.440
Just enjoy.

02:37:53.440 --> 02:37:57.440
I lost, actually, on that cabinet, over $230.

02:37:57.440 --> 02:37:59.440
So thank you, Golf Land, you know.

02:37:59.440 --> 02:38:03.440
No, this is what I get for doing you guys a favor. Thanks a lot.

02:38:03.440 --> 02:38:05.440
I'm done.

02:38:05.440 --> 02:38:08.440
Alrighty, moving on.

02:38:08.440 --> 02:38:21.440
How can I follow that one up? F you to myself because I have a whole stack of tests to correct and I haven't started yet and I have to have them done by tomorrow morning.

02:38:21.440 --> 02:38:25.440
But hey, I got better things to do like play Final Fantasy and WarioWare.

02:38:25.440 --> 02:38:45.440
And a nephew to WarioWare for being too short. I'm already all the way through it. I have one unlock left to get, and it's the unlock that you would get when you get a flower on every single minigame. And that's going to take me too long to get, so I said fuck it. So, that's it. I really don't have a lot of interesting to say.

02:38:45.440 --> 02:38:47.440
We need to put the parrot.

02:38:47.440 --> 02:38:49.440
The parrot was cool.

02:38:49.440 --> 02:38:54.440
And the last unlock I got was a soundtrack thing.

02:38:54.440 --> 02:38:57.440
So now I can get Ashley's theme song.

02:38:57.440 --> 02:39:01.440
Because I'm uninterrupted and the theme song for Ashley is cool.

02:39:01.440 --> 02:39:03.440
So I'm going to rip the theme song.

02:39:03.440 --> 02:39:05.440
Because it's rad.

02:39:05.440 --> 02:39:08.440
Let's go to our guest FUs.

02:39:08.440 --> 02:39:11.440
I guess we'll start it off with explicit.

02:39:11.440 --> 02:39:22.440
Well, now that I found out everybody was already talking about the FUs already, Jamie was talking about the SEVs, I was going to say the same thing, so my FE goes to that section.

02:39:22.440 --> 02:39:36.440
And the FE to RVGL, I think Logi explained most of that, some of that already. Let's see. Oh yeah, big FE goes to fucking parents who blame it on the media.

02:39:36.440 --> 02:39:49.840
Okay, an F.V. goes to parents accusing the media for actions that kids commit all for

02:39:49.840 --> 02:39:54.880
their own, what they think is a bad influence to kids.

02:39:54.880 --> 02:40:02.240
First of all, if you're going to let your kids play stuff like Halo 2 or Grand Theft

02:40:02.240 --> 02:40:05.440
part of San Andreas you should know what the consequences are and tell your kids

02:40:05.440 --> 02:40:12.800
how what not to do and I mean talk to your kids don't blame it on the media

02:40:12.800 --> 02:40:22.680
for such actions I mean you bought from the game I was about to get there too

02:40:22.680 --> 02:40:28.720
I mean parents are the most responsible ones for the issues we had a lot we had

02:40:28.720 --> 02:40:42.720
My aunt just had a lawsuit with some games. For some reason I told her that it's not really worth the lawsuit.

02:40:42.720 --> 02:40:49.720
They treat their kids the wrong way and that's all I'm about to say.

02:40:49.720 --> 02:40:57.720
FV goes to, of course, they have already discussed this before, the Milpies Golf Land issue with pads.

02:40:57.720 --> 02:41:08.720
They should have switched it within the groove pads, and hopefully they make sure that the pads are going to be well for March Madness 2k5.

02:41:08.720 --> 02:41:13.720
But to make sure everything calms down, I'll say to be continued for now.

02:41:13.720 --> 02:41:16.720
Alright then, Angel's turn to get ranty.

02:41:16.720 --> 02:41:20.720
Of you to know internet for two days, that sucked.

02:41:20.720 --> 02:41:24.720
Yeah.

02:41:24.720 --> 02:41:28.720
And of you to have Final Fantasy XI not working, that sucks.

02:41:28.720 --> 02:41:32.720
It black screens right after the play online stuff's over.

02:41:32.720 --> 02:41:36.720
And I think it might have to do with the last update we just had.

02:41:36.720 --> 02:41:40.720
I don't know what's up with that. Damn it, I want to play.

02:41:40.720 --> 02:41:44.720
Call Squeenix and call him a bunch of fucking fuckers.

02:41:44.720 --> 02:41:55.760
maybe and if you don't like a you know the holiday weekend because it went too

02:41:55.760 --> 02:42:00.660
fast again so you know tomorrow's the last day of that be glad you get a

02:42:00.660 --> 02:42:04.780
holiday weekend sit down sit down actually it doesn't really count because

02:42:04.780 --> 02:42:09.020
Friday and Monday don't have school anyway so it's like just a regular week

02:42:09.020 --> 02:42:15.820
for me anyway except for maybe possible things being closed tomorrow other than

02:42:15.820 --> 02:42:21.620
that you know it's just a regular week for me

02:42:22.020 --> 02:42:34.620
all right let's go on to the chat room FUs started off with dark lion xvi one

02:42:34.620 --> 02:42:40.700
FU for tonight. FU to the chat room for teasing me about the way I laugh. I don't give a flying

02:42:40.700 --> 02:42:45.340
fuck what you guys say about my laugh. I laugh the way I wanted to, so in the words of Yoda,

02:42:45.340 --> 02:42:53.780
up the shut fuck. Preach on, brother. RPGKing7 says, first, thanks for reading my FU last

02:42:53.780 --> 02:43:00.380
week. You're welcome. I actually think it would be up the shut fuck. Shut up. RPGKing7

02:43:00.380 --> 02:43:04.900
says, thanks for reading my F.U. last week. You're welcome. This week, F.U. to kill Steelers

02:43:04.900 --> 02:43:14.700

02:43:14.700 --> 02:43:20.000
me to call into OrangeLawn's radio now, only to take the spot himself. Now I feel the need

02:43:20.000 --> 02:43:26.860
to pwn him at Guilty Gear X to reload again. Ouch. It's on. It's on. Somebody just got

02:43:26.860 --> 02:43:31.640
served. MPQ says, F you to Final Fantasy 11 for not working on my computer. F you to my

02:43:31.640 --> 02:43:35.980
computer for not being capable of playing real games. F you to game tracks for letting

02:43:35.980 --> 02:43:41.580
the DDR machine slowly die. F you to myself for getting so emo over Final Fantasy 11 not

02:43:41.580 --> 02:43:50.720
working. F you to EB, any comments for that Angel? Uh, call Squeenix? F you to EB for

02:43:50.720 --> 02:43:54.880
not giving me cash back for the game not working so I had to buy something else. And F you

02:43:54.880 --> 02:44:01.420
to iTunes for not having real good music available. Hey, do a search for an iMix called Dance

02:44:01.420 --> 02:44:05.580
Dance Revolution and it says Orange Laundrio's name in the description and it's all a whole

02:44:05.580 --> 02:44:09.980
bunch of Dance Dance Revolution songs. I put it together and it's on iTunes. Look for it.

02:44:09.980 --> 02:44:14.480
I'll find a link. Maybe I can find a link. Mikolatov says, first FU of the week goes

02:44:14.480 --> 02:44:20.460
to gaming expenses. E3 plus PSP plus night style equals pornus. Second FU goes to my

02:44:20.460 --> 02:44:24.240
Nintendo DS. I have two games and they are the only two games I want for the next several

02:44:24.240 --> 02:44:28.960
months therefore I may trade it in towards my PSP purchase. Final F.U. goes

02:44:28.960 --> 02:44:35.220
to my car smelling like burning every time I drive it. Bugz says F.U. to no

02:44:35.220 --> 02:44:42.160
naked hot tubbing this week I'm a demub ass. Sephiroth1215 or 1215 or

02:44:42.160 --> 02:44:47.260
1215 says F.U. to all the snow that is falling right now and an F.U. for the

02:44:47.260 --> 02:44:53.160
difficulty being raised all the way up on the DDR machine. Illusion says F.U. to

02:44:53.160 --> 02:44:59.560
Shakeys not having the regular I got you babe to do karaoke to they had some lame remix with bad synth in it

02:44:59.920 --> 02:45:03.680
Anyway, it was totally lame and not gay enough for the incredibly homoerotic

02:45:03.680 --> 02:45:09.220
I got you babe karaoke that I was doing with Larry a big burly construction worker from the bay that whispers sweet

02:45:09.220 --> 02:45:11.220
Nothing's into my ear at night

02:45:12.080 --> 02:45:14.080
Huh

02:45:14.440 --> 02:45:16.440
Huh

02:45:16.440 --> 02:45:19.180
Just just a wake-up call if you guys are falling asleep there

02:45:19.180 --> 02:45:25.420
Anyway, FU to this week for going by so slow but that it was only 4 days long.

02:45:25.420 --> 02:45:29.980
Illusions says FU to Gwen Stefani for selling out and her crappy new song that makes me

02:45:29.980 --> 02:45:32.420
cry.

02:45:32.420 --> 02:45:35.420
John Fields says huge FU to NCSX.

02:45:35.420 --> 02:45:40.780
I waited 12 days and you still haven't gotten PlayStation, er, PlayStation, Phantasy Star

02:45:40.780 --> 02:45:42.740
Online episode 4 in.

02:45:42.740 --> 02:45:44.300
I had to go with Haumea.

02:45:44.300 --> 02:45:45.300
FU.

02:45:45.300 --> 02:45:52.300
F you to not having enough hours in a week. DJ Ranma S says F you to a friend of mine

02:45:52.340 --> 02:45:56.260
for being a dick to this girl I know. Payback's a bitch, cause I'm gonna go for it while you

02:45:56.260 --> 02:46:03.180
waller in your own self-pity. Let's have tea! I love that name. Let's have tea. I like tea.

02:46:03.180 --> 02:46:07.580
I need tea right now, cause my voice is in a horse. That's a very pleasant name. Which

02:46:07.580 --> 02:46:13.340
so doesn't work for this segment. So I'm renaming this person Let's Have Evil Tea. You know

02:46:13.340 --> 02:46:14.340
That'd be funny.

02:46:14.340 --> 02:46:15.340
What?

02:46:15.340 --> 02:46:18.340
Um, well, it's kind of random.

02:46:18.340 --> 02:46:19.340
Okay.

02:46:19.340 --> 02:46:23.180
Um, but you know how we were talking about earlier, how they have those slash whatevers?

02:46:23.180 --> 02:46:24.180
Yeah.

02:46:24.180 --> 02:46:30.140
Okay, well, if you're like constipated, you can have slash logout.

02:46:30.140 --> 02:46:34.140
Ha ha, ha ha ha ha.

02:46:34.140 --> 02:46:35.380
That was nasty.

02:46:35.380 --> 02:46:36.900
I hate you.

02:46:36.900 --> 02:46:41.860
Let's have tea, says F you to the guy who hit my stepdad's SUV earlier today.

02:46:41.860 --> 02:46:47.020
got flipped and totaled. That's what you get for having an SUV? Hey, hey, hey, that's not

02:46:47.020 --> 02:46:53.780
nice. He has a... Or it might be a she, sorry. They have a pleasant name. I think it was

02:46:53.780 --> 02:47:00.780
Julie who drove by a wreck where an SUV and like a minivan ran into each other and the

02:47:00.780 --> 02:47:04.980
SUV rolled and landed on the minivan. No matter what kind of car you drive, people... I think

02:47:04.980 --> 02:47:08.900
about two birds with one stone. I mean, what... I mean, SUVs are so big in the first place,

02:47:08.900 --> 02:47:13.900
to take a lot of talent to crash into one so I mean come on tell your dad to

02:47:13.900 --> 02:47:20.940
like get a real car now stepdad one of one that's got a lower center of gravity

02:47:20.940 --> 02:47:26.420
legends that who says f you to elements of my school student body aka the elitist

02:47:26.420 --> 02:47:31.140
for dropping emo bombs last week over the n-word being used in a play in my

02:47:31.140 --> 02:47:36.340
school that illustrates the horrors of slavery America has a way of driving the

02:47:36.340 --> 02:47:39.900
point across that slavery was really fucked up back then which is I in my

02:47:39.900 --> 02:47:45.100
humble opinion the best way to do it okay I know I'm old okay but what the

02:47:45.100 --> 02:47:50.580
hell's an emo bomb well you know what what emo is emo is that you know I'm so

02:47:50.580 --> 02:47:58.340
sad I'm gonna slash my wrist because I'm so sad you know it's basically modern

02:47:58.340 --> 02:48:04.540
god yeah kind of modern Gotham happy colors okay so basically it's like the

02:48:04.540 --> 02:48:08.840
people who bag on movies without seeing them like they bag on dogma for being a

02:48:08.840 --> 02:48:12.340
satanic movie without realizing that it's actually a pretty religious movie

02:48:12.340 --> 02:48:16.180
at heart I think that's kind of the point Zach was trying to make here f you

02:48:16.180 --> 02:48:20.740
to freeze pop infecting the ears of orange launch radio listeners and f you

02:48:20.740 --> 02:48:24.940
to tonight's internet connection at my campus causing causing major skipping in

02:48:24.940 --> 02:48:30.180
and then he got cut off dark night says one f you to squeamish for making the

02:48:30.180 --> 02:48:37.640
cutscenes in Star Ocean too darn long. I have to add another one. Okay. F you to the

02:48:37.640 --> 02:48:45.060
burning sensation of liquid daquil. And Let's Have Tea would just like to follow

02:48:45.060 --> 02:48:53.100
up the ever-pleasant Let's Have Tea. He did get a real car, a Corvette. Forgiven.

02:48:53.100 --> 02:48:57.620
Alright, we're gonna do a quickie break and when we come back we'll do a little

questions now for Ask Orange Lounge, and in this break, gotcha!

02:50:32.660 --> 02:50:40.660
If you can say goodbye, baby, tell me why

02:50:46.660 --> 02:50:53.660
You say that love is not a possession You say that love needs fantasy

02:50:53.660 --> 02:51:00.660
You say we must fear this devotion But you don't say that you love me

02:51:00.660 --> 02:51:07.660
Sometimes I wonder what I'm doing Sometimes I'm cold and serious

02:51:07.660 --> 02:51:14.660
But when you touch my body and close your eyes My little baby, I don't realize

02:51:14.660 --> 02:51:22.660
If you can say goodbye, baby, tell me why You don't wanna love me just like I do

02:51:22.660 --> 02:51:27.660
You can say goodbye, tell me what I've got to do

02:51:29.660 --> 02:51:33.660
If you can say goodbye, baby tell me why

02:51:34.660 --> 02:51:36.660
You don't wanna love me, just like I do

02:51:36.660 --> 02:51:42.660
Just like I do, you can't say goodbye Tell me what I've got to do

02:52:06.660 --> 02:52:13.660
Rock over London. Rock over Chicago. Orange Lounge Radio. It's a good place to listen

02:52:13.660 --> 02:52:18.660
to the music.

02:52:18.660 --> 02:52:23.840
We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio, and we're about ready to wrap up tonight's show,

02:52:23.840 --> 02:52:28.100
but darn it, it's time for you guys to contribute a little something to this train wreck of

02:52:28.100 --> 02:52:35.660
a show, so we're gonna do a little bit of Ask Orange Lounge.

02:52:35.660 --> 02:52:38.060
we're playing on the webcam right now by the way I hope you guys are watching

02:52:38.060 --> 02:52:41.420
over there it's kind of fun www.orangeloungeradio.com anyway let's get into this

02:52:41.420 --> 02:52:44.220
week's Ask Orange Lounge

02:52:48.060 --> 02:52:53.860
let's ask orange lounge some stupid question what will we find out this week

02:52:53.860 --> 02:53:00.900
on orange lounge radio is there a point to this segment I don't think so it's

02:53:00.900 --> 02:53:16.580
only here to fill a little time question from RPG King 7 question is what is

02:53:16.580 --> 02:53:24.100
everyone in the lounges opinions of us Canadians what do we think of Canadians

02:53:24.100 --> 02:53:30.720
they're from Canada I know Loki's thinking of something horrible to say

02:53:30.720 --> 02:53:34.600
say here. I'm not thinking anything horrible. No, honestly, Canadians are cool. They've

02:53:34.600 --> 02:53:39.800
got, you know, laxer laws up there, it seems like, you know, and it's just, you know, it's

02:53:39.800 --> 02:53:45.280
a little cold for my taste, but... It's just cold. It's just, you know, it's cool. I mean,

02:53:45.280 --> 02:53:49.160
I don't think anything wrong against Canadians. They got the gay marriage thing up there.

02:53:49.160 --> 02:53:52.680
They're ahead of the game as far as I'm concerned. They've got that stuff going for them. But

02:53:52.680 --> 02:53:56.680
here's my problem with Canada. If I went to Canada, I'd be out of a job, because I work

02:53:56.680 --> 02:54:00.200
in the health care industry, and they've got the nationalized health care thing going on,

02:54:00.200 --> 02:54:01.200
I'd be out of a job.

02:54:01.200 --> 02:54:06.960
Well, the only thing I don't like is French Canadians, but that's just because I don't

02:54:06.960 --> 02:54:07.960
like the French.

02:54:07.960 --> 02:54:09.460
No one likes the French Canadians.

02:54:09.460 --> 02:54:10.460
That's not true.

02:54:10.460 --> 02:54:11.460
I'm kidding.

02:54:11.460 --> 02:54:17.320
So, I mean, and there's other, hey, you know, Canada gave us Jim Carrey, you know.

02:54:17.320 --> 02:54:18.800
And Alanis Morissette, my favorite.

02:54:18.800 --> 02:54:24.640
Yeah, well, okay, they gave us Jim Carrey, and, um, shut up.

02:54:24.640 --> 02:54:29.100
And they also gave us Tom, oh wait, no, no, Tom Green.

02:54:29.100 --> 02:54:32.020
You can have Tom Greenback, actually.

02:54:32.020 --> 02:54:36.980
Dan says, too nice, too close, and too quiet.

02:54:36.980 --> 02:54:38.480
Yeah, you know, what are they plotting?

02:54:38.480 --> 02:54:39.900
They all live near the border up there, you know.

02:54:39.900 --> 02:54:40.580
No, I'm kidding.

02:54:40.580 --> 02:54:46.260
Actually, I went, years ago, I went to Vancouver and Victoria Island.

02:54:46.260 --> 02:54:48.340
I thought it was just beautiful out there.

02:54:48.340 --> 02:54:51.820
That would be a place I could live if it wasn't so goddamn cold and rainy.

02:54:51.820 --> 02:54:53.900
But it's beautiful out there.

02:54:53.900 --> 02:54:55.220
It's great.

02:54:55.220 --> 02:54:58.100
I do not, I can safely say I have no issues with Canada.

02:54:58.100 --> 02:55:01.740
and I've met a lot of very cool Canadians online. The weird thing is they

02:55:01.740 --> 02:55:03.080
like all live in Toronto

02:55:03.080 --> 02:55:07.340
which is, I guess Toronto's where it's at. Go Leafs!

02:55:07.340 --> 02:55:10.480
Well, yeah,

02:55:10.480 --> 02:55:14.040
um, they have good musicians. That's all I gotta say.

02:55:14.040 --> 02:55:17.780
Shatner's Canadian? Oh God.

02:55:17.780 --> 02:55:21.020
Rob already said Alanis Morissette, so I gotta say Berniculides, cuz, yeah.

02:55:21.020 --> 02:55:24.740
Or Celine Dion? Moving on.

02:55:24.740 --> 02:55:28.180
Well the game is Jim Carrey. I know.

02:55:28.180 --> 02:55:31.900
What about Bryan Adams? Legend of Zaku says,

02:55:31.900 --> 02:55:35.860
seeing that you guys are the drinking type, have you ever thought of creating

02:55:35.860 --> 02:55:38.300
some Bamani themed cocktail drinks?

02:55:38.300 --> 02:55:41.740
My fire,

02:55:41.740 --> 02:55:48.740
like Goldschlager and... Max 300, Goldschlager, Jagermeister, and 151 all

02:55:48.740 --> 02:55:55.300
51 all mixed together.

02:55:55.300 --> 02:55:56.300
I don't know.

02:55:56.300 --> 02:55:57.300
I don't know.

02:55:57.300 --> 02:55:58.300
I don't know.

02:55:58.300 --> 02:56:06.500
I imagine some dork out there has thought of something.

02:56:06.500 --> 02:56:08.580
Maybe that's a thread we should start on the forums.

02:56:08.580 --> 02:56:10.420
See what people can come up with a drink.

02:56:10.420 --> 02:56:13.100
You know, I have a friend who's going to bartending school.

02:56:13.100 --> 02:56:16.280
So what I'll do is I will ask him to come up with some new drinks.

02:56:16.280 --> 02:56:17.280
Maybe he's even listening.

02:56:17.280 --> 02:56:23.280
He's starting Bartender School this week. I'll ask him to try and come up with some new drinks, and when he tells me what's in it, I will give them names.

02:56:23.280 --> 02:56:25.280
And we will come up with a Bomani drink.

02:56:25.280 --> 02:56:29.280
We could use the one that I made with the orange juice and the Malibu.

02:56:29.280 --> 02:56:30.280
I remember that. That was pretty good.

02:56:30.280 --> 02:56:32.280
That can be Summer Love.

02:56:32.280 --> 02:56:33.280
My Summer Love?

02:56:33.280 --> 02:56:34.280
My Summer Love.

02:56:34.280 --> 02:56:35.280
I was thinking the same thing.

02:56:35.280 --> 02:56:36.280
Okay. Anyway.

02:56:40.280 --> 02:56:41.280
Miklatov.

02:56:41.280 --> 02:56:45.280
Dear Ask Orange Lounge, please make some E3 plans.

02:56:45.280 --> 02:56:46.280
Alright, stop bugging me.

02:56:46.280 --> 02:56:51.200
and boom boom dollar was not on DER first mix meaning it had no basic step

02:56:51.200 --> 02:56:52.280
rating hey buddy

02:56:52.280 --> 02:56:55.360
it was on US first mix

02:56:55.360 --> 02:56:59.560
which was basically just the Japanese first mix imported

02:56:59.560 --> 02:57:06.680
or 1.5 mix. MPQ says why do laptops make shitty

02:57:06.680 --> 02:57:11.080
gaming PCs? DarkSakura who has a laptop in her lap care to answer

02:57:11.080 --> 02:57:15.080
I haven't actually tried to run any games on this although I could install the

02:57:15.080 --> 02:57:23.280
Actually, my laptop would probably be very good for gaming, because I've got a G-Force

02:57:23.280 --> 02:57:32.400
in here, and I've got a 3.06 processor, and a bunch of RAM.

02:57:32.400 --> 02:57:33.400
Mine would run Final Fantasy XI.

02:57:33.400 --> 02:57:37.000
I'm going to download the benchmark and see if my laptop would run Final Fantasy XI.

02:57:37.000 --> 02:57:39.500
Just so I can laugh.

02:57:39.500 --> 02:57:40.500
You know what?

02:57:40.500 --> 02:57:43.520
I think part of the problem, at least with older laptops, newer ones don't do this so

02:57:43.520 --> 02:57:44.520
much, but the older ones?

02:57:44.520 --> 02:57:49.520
Like, if you change the way you're looking at the screen, it gets lighter and darker, like it's just the way the display works.

02:57:49.520 --> 02:57:50.520
It's just an LCD screen.

02:57:50.520 --> 02:57:54.520
Exactly, and that annoyed the shit out of me, but new ones don't really have that problem.

02:57:54.520 --> 02:57:55.520
That's not a problem.

02:57:55.520 --> 02:57:57.520
I know, but I'm thinking about old ones.

02:57:57.520 --> 02:58:03.520
The problem is that laptops are generation behind, usually, and they're also very expensive.

02:58:03.520 --> 02:58:07.520
Also, since they're passively cooled and they don't have any actual fans inside of them,

02:58:07.520 --> 02:58:17.520
You get really hot and you can't put all that expensive, you know, high-powered, you know, devices and stuff, video cards, sound cards, all that stuff in there.

02:58:17.520 --> 02:58:31.520
Now, granted, Alienware does make laptops, and they can get some pretty decent laptops out there, but when it's gonna come, you know, between laptop and, you know, PC, you're gonna be better off with a PC.

02:58:31.520 --> 02:58:33.520
For the money.

02:58:33.520 --> 02:58:54.520
Alright, let's see here. Al Mullet wants to ask, as a future newbie to Beatmania 2DX, there are quite a few songs I haven't heard yet. What would be your favorites to play? Maybe one favorite song to play in 2DX. Mine would be Deadline, as horrid as that song is. I absolutely love that song, Deadline 5th Style.

02:58:54.520 --> 02:59:02.520
I used to be really fond of playing Sync, but now it would probably have to be, I actually really did call it, on both levels, so.

02:59:02.520 --> 02:59:08.520
When you're first getting started and you're still playing one-stars, Five Fathoms on Third Style is pretty rad and it has the right video.

02:59:08.520 --> 02:59:09.520
Five Fathoms, that would be the one.

02:59:09.520 --> 02:59:11.520
Five Fathoms is like the best song to learn on for one-star.

02:59:11.520 --> 02:59:16.520
Yeah, it's the one with the DDR in the video, like the old-ass DDR that had Boom Boom Dollar in it.

02:59:16.520 --> 02:59:17.520
Mikutov.

02:59:17.520 --> 02:59:24.520
Let's see, we got a lot of questions in a little time. I'm going to try and get through as many of these as we can.

02:59:24.520 --> 02:59:26.520
You can still submit some, though, if you want. I'm looking through some.

02:59:26.520 --> 02:59:32.520
John Fields says, Hey Sky, why isn't this show or station listed on the Wikipedia?

02:59:32.520 --> 02:59:38.520
I'm somewhat familiar with Wikipedia. Is that like the user-created encyclopedia?

02:59:38.520 --> 02:59:45.520
Kind of like, what do they call that Mozilla database of all the sites? Free web or something?

02:59:45.520 --> 02:59:47.520
I found Mobile, Alabama on the Wikipedia.

02:59:47.520 --> 02:59:51.520
You know what, I just have no idea how to hook something like that up.

02:59:51.520 --> 02:59:55.520
like that up. If somebody wants to send me an email and tell me how to do it, Rob at

02:59:55.520 --> 02:59:59.440
OrangeLoungeRadio.com or if you just want to submit it, as long as you don't talk shit

02:59:59.440 --> 03:00:04.520
about it, you have my blessings. And I imagine DarkSacker and Loki feel the same way, yes?

03:00:04.520 --> 03:00:08.800
Whatever. Yeah, don't fuck it up. That's all we ask.

03:00:08.800 --> 03:00:15.880
Let's Have Tea would like to know, what is the high score in Orange Lounge Radio Pinball?

03:00:15.880 --> 03:00:20.280
Little known fact, before I got into DDR, I was a pinball whore. I really loved pinball.

03:00:20.280 --> 03:00:24.280
Rob was the pinball wizard. He was blind and used to be called Tommy.

03:00:24.280 --> 03:00:33.280
My favorite ones, I always liked the Return from Mars game that had the little animations that were inside it.

03:00:33.280 --> 03:00:36.280
You know they actually did one for Star Wars Episode I as well.

03:00:36.280 --> 03:00:37.280
They had a little hologram one.

03:00:37.280 --> 03:00:41.280
And as much as I am not huge into Star Wars, that pinball game was pretty cool.

03:00:41.280 --> 03:00:46.280
I would have to say my very favorite pinball machine, though, was probably the Addams Family.

03:00:46.280 --> 03:00:48.280
But lots of people liked that machine.

03:00:48.280 --> 03:00:49.280
House of Magic.

03:00:49.280 --> 03:00:54.400
House of Magic's awesome, too. Those are probably two of the top tables out there. Another one

03:00:54.400 --> 03:00:59.960
that I always liked was Pinbot, which is kind of a running joke on outside the box when

03:00:59.960 --> 03:01:04.440
it's actually on the air. But Pinbot's a really cool one, too. I always liked that one. And

03:01:04.440 --> 03:01:07.800
the NES version, not the same. In fact, it's very much not the same.

03:01:07.800 --> 03:01:14.720
What was I going to say? My favorite time playing, what was it, Invasion of Mars or

03:01:14.720 --> 03:01:21.120
whatever that one was called, Return to Mars, was when we rubber banded, we opened up the

03:01:21.120 --> 03:01:27.680
machine and rubber banded down the two sides and so the ball can only be lost through the

03:01:27.680 --> 03:01:33.160
center and we'd play like to the end of the game on that. It was fun.

03:01:33.160 --> 03:01:39.800
I want my bike night 2000. But my pinball machine when I went to the University of South

03:01:39.800 --> 03:01:50.680
Alabama was World Cup soccer, 94, because I was always really good at hitting the goal.

03:01:50.680 --> 03:01:57.740
And Dan and I, a little after I first moved out here, we used to go to Godfather's Pizza

03:01:57.740 --> 03:02:03.200
in Thomas and play Last Action Hero pinball all the time.

03:02:03.200 --> 03:02:08.380
Ooh, JasonXB brings up a good point in the chat room, some PC pinball games that were

03:02:08.380 --> 03:02:12.820
actually really good, Epic Pinball. The Epic Pinball games were awesome.

03:02:12.820 --> 03:02:17.080
You can get Pin Mame. Pin Mame's not the same to me. I would rather

03:02:17.080 --> 03:02:20.800
play Epic Pinball than Pin Mame. Epic Pinball I bet's in Abandonware probably

03:02:20.800 --> 03:02:24.400
right now. Probably. As much as I think Pin Mame is an awesome

03:02:24.400 --> 03:02:29.360
idea and I totally support the project, it just... I don't know. It doesn't work for

03:02:29.360 --> 03:02:35.560
me. It doesn't... I think it's because I prefer the tables that were created for the PC. On

03:02:35.560 --> 03:02:40.160
a PC if that makes any sense I don't know there's some really good virtual

03:02:40.160 --> 03:02:46.160
tables there I used to have and if anybody can think of this and private

03:02:46.160 --> 03:02:50.120
message me the pinball game that this was I would love you forever there was a

03:02:50.120 --> 03:02:56.280
pinball game I used to have on my old ass PC my hundred megahertz PC and it

03:02:56.280 --> 03:03:00.640
had four tables in it one of them was like a haunted house I think the other

03:03:00.640 --> 03:03:06.320
one was a raceway, one of them was a circus, and I remember the circus table was a demo

03:03:06.320 --> 03:03:09.500
you could download on the internet, but then there was another one called, like, Billion

03:03:09.500 --> 03:03:14.320
Dollar Game Show or something. It was a game and it had four tables. It wasn't Epic, it

03:03:14.320 --> 03:03:18.840
was some other pinball game. If I could find that again, I would be so happy. Did Sierra

03:03:18.840 --> 03:03:22.200
make a pinball game? I don't think it was Sierra either, I think it was some other unknown

03:03:22.200 --> 03:03:27.680
company. Well, I saw one of the people, I talked to one of the people at E3, um, last

03:03:27.680 --> 03:03:33.240
year who said that they were working on a pinball game for the PS2 that was

03:03:33.240 --> 03:03:37.800
supposed to emulate a bunch of the old tables hmm that's cool and I'm not sure

03:03:37.800 --> 03:03:42.160
which ones were gonna be on there they only had like a basic you know just

03:03:42.160 --> 03:03:46.640
generic table for demo but I heard that I'd asked about they said they were

03:03:46.640 --> 03:03:52.560
seeking some licenses or something hmm I want them to actually go to Capcom and

03:03:52.560 --> 03:03:57.660
produce the it was when I had brought up on the show before that Dan showed me

03:03:57.660 --> 03:04:02.380
there's only like I think 16 of them in existence and I can't remember the name

03:04:02.380 --> 03:04:10.020
of it it was something bar the he needs to p.m. me the name of it I'm as soon as

03:04:10.020 --> 03:04:14.600
I get it I'll tell you but I had like the little dancing girl in the background

03:04:14.600 --> 03:04:20.020
you could play the family edition or the non family edition and it was I can't

03:04:20.020 --> 03:04:28.260
remember the name of it now their most shittiest the shittiest pinball game I

03:04:28.260 --> 03:04:38.060
think I've ever played was dr. dude it was awful you know what somebody in the

03:04:38.060 --> 03:04:44.380
chat room is posting a suggestion for the game that I that they think it is

03:04:44.380 --> 03:04:50.540
and it was big bang that was thank you hyper 3d pinball you know what I think I

03:04:50.540 --> 03:04:55.380
own this game but I don't think it's the same one I'm trying to think of right

03:04:55.380 --> 03:05:00.140
now I'm trying to find more pictures of it it's making me mad I think it might

03:05:00.140 --> 03:05:06.100
be by the same company but it wasn't that game I don't remember darn it oh

03:05:06.100 --> 03:05:09.060
well we only have a little bit of show left okay I appreciate you guys trying

03:05:09.060 --> 03:05:13.060
I'm posting pictures of this table in the chatroom.

03:05:13.060 --> 03:05:25.060
But that's the one, and they only made a few of them because this was in production right before Capcom's pinball division went out.

03:05:25.060 --> 03:05:30.060
I want a pinball table. I want a Black Knight 2000 machine.

03:05:30.060 --> 03:05:37.060
Somebody's suggesting that maybe it's extreme pinball?

03:05:37.060 --> 03:05:41.060
And yes, I, I will, um, oh my gosh, I think this is it.

03:05:44.060 --> 03:05:50.060
Uh oh. No, no, I don't think it is. Oh, I think I have that game too, but that's not the one I'm thinking of.

03:05:50.060 --> 03:05:57.060
I'm not sure. Anyways. I can't tell! I'm so upset, because I really want this. You guys don't understand, I want this game again.

03:06:00.060 --> 03:06:05.060
Grr. No, that's not it. Darn it. Oh well. Maybe someday.

03:06:05.060 --> 03:06:09.220
Okay, um, let's see. What we're gonna do now is we're gonna go around and get everybody's...

03:06:09.220 --> 03:06:11.700
Oh, I'll do one more question, really quick.

03:06:11.700 --> 03:06:13.900
Uh, Allusion, and sorry to those guys we didn't get to.

03:06:13.900 --> 03:06:14.700
Allusion asks,

03:06:14.700 --> 03:06:20.380
Hey guys, I have a question. What did you do for Valentine's Day? Did you get shagged up vigorously?

03:06:20.380 --> 03:06:25.140
I had chocolate cheese pie.

03:06:25.140 --> 03:06:28.900
I had dinner with my boy.

03:06:28.900 --> 03:06:30.900
And then I went to school on actual Valentine's Day.

03:06:34.900 --> 03:06:36.900
Alright. I made pasta.

03:06:37.900 --> 03:06:39.900
And then I got shagged vigorously.

03:06:41.900 --> 03:06:45.900
I did not get shagged vigorously this Valentine's Day, but that's okay.

03:06:46.900 --> 03:06:48.900
I can deal with rejection.

03:06:50.900 --> 03:06:52.900
It's time to go around and get everybody's final thought.

03:06:52.900 --> 03:06:54.900
Thank you guys for tuning into Orange Launch Radio tonight.

03:06:54.900 --> 03:06:58.900
Let's start it off with Explicit. Your final thought, please.

03:06:58.900 --> 03:07:00.900
Jamie, get Will soon.

03:07:00.900 --> 03:07:03.900
Angel, your final thought.

03:07:03.900 --> 03:07:06.900
Final Finishing. Must work-y. Dang it.

03:07:06.900 --> 03:07:09.900
Loki, your final thought.

03:07:09.900 --> 03:07:14.900
I'm only down to two PCs now. What am I to do?

03:07:14.900 --> 03:07:21.900
My final thought is, um, when will Outside the Box return? Nobody knows.

03:07:21.900 --> 03:07:23.900
DarkSakura, your final thought?

03:07:23.900 --> 03:07:26.900
I won a Black Knight 2000 pinball machine.

03:07:26.900 --> 03:07:31.900
That's it, guys. Thanks for tuning in. Check out our podcast, dammit!

03:07:31.900 --> 03:07:34.900
DarkSakura, you can have tonight's final word.

03:07:34.900 --> 03:07:36.900
Oh, final word.

03:07:36.900 --> 03:07:41.900
The final word of the evening is...

03:07:41.900 --> 03:07:46.900

03:09:09.660 --> 03:09:10.660
Pop.

03:09:10.660 --> 03:09:24.660
He had it comin', he had it comin', he only had himself to blame.

03:09:24.660 --> 03:09:32.660
If you'd have been there, if you'd have seen it, I bet you you wouldn't have done the same.

03:09:32.660 --> 03:09:35.660
The best flesh I've ever wished

03:09:35.660 --> 03:09:39.660
The best flesh I've ever wished

03:09:39.660 --> 03:09:43.660
You know how people have these little habits that get you down?

03:09:43.660 --> 03:09:44.660
Like...

03:09:44.660 --> 03:09:45.660
Bernie.

03:09:45.660 --> 03:09:47.660
Bernie likes to chew gum.

03:09:47.660 --> 03:09:49.660
No, not chew.

03:09:49.660 --> 03:09:50.660
Pop.

03:09:50.660 --> 03:09:55.660
So I came home this one day and I'm really irritated and I'm looking for a little bit of sympathy.

03:09:55.660 --> 03:10:00.660
And there's Bernie, lying on the couch, drinking a beer and chewing.

03:10:00.660 --> 03:10:02.660
No, not chewing.

03:10:02.660 --> 03:10:03.660
Poppin'!

03:10:03.660 --> 03:10:09.660
So I said to him, I said, you pop that gum one more time.

03:10:09.660 --> 03:10:11.660
And he did.

03:10:11.660 --> 03:10:16.660
So I took the shotgun off the wall and I fired two warning shots.

03:10:16.660 --> 03:10:20.660
Into his head.

03:10:20.660 --> 03:10:24.660
He had it comin', he had it comin'

03:10:24.660 --> 03:10:28.660
He only had it felt so plain

03:10:28.660 --> 03:10:35.660
If you'd have been there, if you'd have heard it, I betcha you would have done the same

03:10:42.660 --> 03:10:46.660
I met Ezekiel Young from Salt Lake City about two years ago

03:10:46.660 --> 03:10:49.660
And he told me he was single, and we hit it off right away

03:10:49.660 --> 03:10:53.660
So we started living together, he'd go to work, he'd come home

03:10:53.660 --> 03:10:56.660
I'd fix him a drink, we'd have dinner

03:10:56.660 --> 03:11:06.300
and then I found out single he told me single my ass not only was he married he

03:11:06.300 --> 03:11:12.020
had six wives one of those Mormons you know so that night when he came home

03:11:12.020 --> 03:11:20.220
from work I fixed in his drink as usual you know some guys just can't hold their

03:11:20.220 --> 03:11:43.080
Now I'm standing in the kitchen carving up the chicken for dinner minding my own business

03:11:43.080 --> 03:11:47.900
in storms my husband will burn in jealous rage you've been screwing the milk man he

03:11:47.900 --> 03:11:54.500
He was crazy and he kept on screaming you've been screwing the milk man, and then he ran into my knife

03:11:55.100 --> 03:11:57.420
He ran into my knife ten times

03:12:07.420 --> 03:12:09.420
Me get a shaker

03:12:09.420 --> 03:12:11.980
Most my yucca here. It's locum left on my fear

03:12:12.700 --> 03:12:14.700
in the glitch of the movie

03:12:14.700 --> 03:12:43.580
My sister Veronica and I had this double act, and my husband Charlie traveled around with

03:12:43.580 --> 03:12:49.260
us. Now for the last number in our act we did these 20 acrobatic tricks in a row. One, two,

03:12:49.260 --> 03:12:54.300
three, four, five splits, spread eagles, backflips, flip flops, one right after the other.

03:12:55.100 --> 03:12:59.820
So this one night before the show we're down at the hotel Cicero, the three of us

03:12:59.820 --> 03:13:07.420
boozing, having a few laughs, and we run out of ice so I go out to get some. I come back,

03:13:07.420 --> 03:13:16.660
open the door and there's Veronica and Charlie doing number 17 the spread eagle

03:13:16.660 --> 03:13:21.820
well I was in such a state of shock I completely blacked out I can't remember

03:13:21.820 --> 03:13:27.220
a thing it wasn't until later when I was washing the blood off my hands I even

03:13:27.220 --> 03:13:29.220
knew they were dead.

03:13:57.220 --> 03:14:00.220
Could you tell me that I was wrong?

03:14:01.220 --> 03:14:04.220
I loved Al Lipschitz more than I could possibly say.

03:14:04.220 --> 03:14:06.220
He was a real artistic guy.

03:14:06.220 --> 03:14:07.220
Sensitive.

03:14:07.220 --> 03:14:08.220
A painter.

03:14:08.220 --> 03:14:11.220
But he was always trying to find himself.

03:14:11.220 --> 03:14:13.220
He'd go out every night looking for himself.

03:14:13.220 --> 03:14:20.220
And on the way, he found Ruth, Gladys, Rosemary, and Irving.

03:14:20.220 --> 03:14:23.220
I guess you could say we broke up because of artistic differences.

03:14:23.220 --> 03:14:25.220
He saw himself as alive.

03:14:25.220 --> 03:14:27.220
And I saw him dead.

03:15:25.220 --> 03:15:32.660
Thank you very much for listening, and we'll see you next week.

03:15:55.220 --> 03:16:07.100
Okay, we figured it out. It's either Pinball Dreams or Pinball Fantasies. They're both

03:16:07.100 --> 03:16:11.500
made by the same developer. They're very similar. So I'm going to check them both out. That

03:16:11.500 --> 03:16:14.340
was it, though. When I do the image search in Google, I get the images of the game I

03:16:14.340 --> 03:16:20.260
remember. So thank you, Jason, for helping me find that out. So I'm very happy. It's

03:16:20.260 --> 03:16:25.140
either Pinball Dreams or Pinball Fantasies. One is the sequel to the other. So that was

03:16:25.140 --> 03:16:28.580
