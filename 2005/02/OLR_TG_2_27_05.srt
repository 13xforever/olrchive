00:00:00,317 --> 00:00:03,958
[SPEAKER_04]: Orange Lounge Radio To Go Edition, week of February 28th, 2005.

2
00:00:04,598 --> 00:00:15,562
[SPEAKER_00]: And now, the Orange Lounge Radio To Go Edition, your internet radio home for discussion on rhythm and music gaming, and all the news on video games that don't suck.

3
00:00:16,022 --> 00:00:20,243
[SPEAKER_00]: And now, here are your hosts, DarkSakura, Sky, and Loki.

4
00:00:21,331 --> 00:00:23,392
[SPEAKER_04]: Hello again everybody!

5
00:00:23,612 --> 00:00:31,897
[SPEAKER_04]: Welcome to another edition of the Orange Lounge Radio To Go Edition, our podcast where we get to talk to you about video games that don't suck.

6
00:00:32,577 --> 00:00:36,239
[SPEAKER_04]: And honestly, a few that do suck sometimes, they just slip in there by chance.

7
00:00:36,980 --> 00:00:41,282
[SPEAKER_04]: Joining me as always, my lovely co-host, say hello to DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.

8
00:00:41,302 --> 00:00:42,163
[SPEAKER_03]: Suck is relative.

9
00:00:43,103 --> 00:00:43,944
[SPEAKER_04]: It is.

10
00:00:44,004 --> 00:00:46,685
[SPEAKER_04]: What I may think sucks, you may think not sucks.

11
00:00:47,506 --> 00:00:48,146
[SPEAKER_02]: Like freeze pops.

12
00:00:49,175 --> 00:00:52,117
[SPEAKER_04]: Final Fantasy XI because that's all I've been conscious for

13
00:01:08,891 --> 00:01:09,572
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been sick.

14
00:01:09,692 --> 00:01:12,113
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yes, you've been battling the sickness this week.

15
00:01:12,434 --> 00:01:12,994
[SPEAKER_02]: The disease.

16
00:01:14,035 --> 00:01:17,117
[SPEAKER_04]: Does it kind of help you to just sit there and veg out to the roleplaying?

17
00:01:17,137 --> 00:01:20,199
[SPEAKER_04]: You're like, slash, slash, cure, cure.

18
00:01:20,219 --> 00:01:21,921
[SPEAKER_04]: Or in your case, cure, cure.

19
00:01:22,221 --> 00:01:29,646
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, in my case, it's been, the order is blind, poisoned, paralyzed.

20
00:01:29,666 --> 00:01:31,308
[SPEAKER_04]: You got your system worked out.

21
00:01:31,788 --> 00:01:34,470
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I have my system worked out, sadly.

22
00:01:35,089 --> 00:01:37,790
[SPEAKER_04]: But you're much farther in the game this time than you were the first time around.

23
00:01:37,910 --> 00:01:41,451
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I hit level 10 on my sub job.

24
00:01:41,611 --> 00:01:43,232
[SPEAKER_04]: What do you think is doing it for you?

25
00:01:43,272 --> 00:01:45,892
[SPEAKER_04]: Just the fact that you have more people to play with this time?

26
00:01:46,052 --> 00:01:49,333
[SPEAKER_03]: The fact that I just have people to play with in general.

27
00:01:50,414 --> 00:01:54,775
[SPEAKER_03]: I maybe played for three months and played with people all of twice.

28
00:01:59,116 --> 00:01:59,617
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's it?

29
00:01:59,677 --> 00:02:00,497
[SPEAKER_04]: Just Final Fantasy XI?

30
00:02:01,917 --> 00:02:02,738
[SPEAKER_03]: And some Guitar Freaks.

31
00:02:03,618 --> 00:02:04,038
[SPEAKER_04]: Very cool.

32
00:02:05,124 --> 00:02:05,785
[SPEAKER_04]: Just for the heck of it.

33
00:02:06,265 --> 00:02:07,346
[SPEAKER_03]: Because Dan wanted to play.

34
00:02:07,766 --> 00:02:08,347
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a good reason.

35
00:02:08,867 --> 00:02:10,388
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, Loki, what have you been playing?

36
00:02:11,429 --> 00:02:16,292
[SPEAKER_05]: I played, well, I started off the week trying to get some other games.

37
00:02:16,932 --> 00:02:20,835
[SPEAKER_05]: I played a little bit of Final Fantasy featuring Charlie's Angels.

38
00:02:20,875 --> 00:02:22,436
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, Final Fantasy X too.

39
00:02:23,277 --> 00:02:25,778
[SPEAKER_05]: And that lost my interest really quick.

40
00:02:26,379 --> 00:02:28,140
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just too annoying.

41
00:02:28,340 --> 00:02:30,642
[SPEAKER_05]: Honestly, the voice acting drove me away.

42
00:02:30,782 --> 00:02:31,282
[SPEAKER_05]: It was just...

43
00:02:32,819 --> 00:02:33,280
[SPEAKER_05]: Scary.

44
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:38,025
[SPEAKER_05]: I couldn't possibly go through that game anymore with Riku yelling some really weird shit.

45
00:02:38,725 --> 00:02:39,226
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not for me.

46
00:02:39,724 --> 00:02:43,827
[SPEAKER_05]: So then I went and played a little bit of Derby Owner's Club and my horse, i.e.

47
00:02:43,887 --> 00:02:45,989
[SPEAKER_05]: Children, is doing very well.

48
00:02:46,329 --> 00:02:51,554
[SPEAKER_04]: Now explain, some folks out there may have never heard of Derby Owner's Club because this podcast goes to a slightly different audience.

49
00:02:51,634 --> 00:02:52,875
[SPEAKER_04]: What is Derby Owner's Club all about?

50
00:02:52,895 --> 00:02:55,037
[SPEAKER_05]: Derby Owner's Club is this game made by Sega.

51
00:02:55,097 --> 00:02:59,120
[SPEAKER_05]: It's giant, it's huge, it's a good $100,000 cabinet.

52
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:06,826
[SPEAKER_05]: Basically what you do is you raise and race racing horses and it's pretty much got the whole jockey thing.

53
00:03:06,886 --> 00:03:08,608
[SPEAKER_05]: You train your horses and you...

54
00:03:09,328 --> 00:03:10,929
[SPEAKER_05]: I should scan some of my cards for our listeners.

55
00:03:10,949 --> 00:03:11,930
[SPEAKER_05]: I only have four horses, because my...

56
00:03:34,371 --> 00:03:36,432
[SPEAKER_04]: I have a horse named Brittany Spears somewhere.

57
00:03:36,472 --> 00:03:37,372
[SPEAKER_04]: She might still be in my wallet.

58
00:03:37,392 --> 00:03:38,253
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember Politary.

59
00:03:38,413 --> 00:03:39,994
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, I had a horse named Politary as well.

60
00:03:40,294 --> 00:03:42,355
[SPEAKER_03]: I have Magical Sound, who's retired.

61
00:03:42,956 --> 00:03:47,879
[SPEAKER_03]: I have Last Message, and Shiroi that's an all-white horse, which is like one of the rarest ones.

62
00:03:48,599 --> 00:03:50,200
[SPEAKER_03]: And I have Gangoro, who's a panda.

63
00:03:51,361 --> 00:03:53,923
[SPEAKER_04]: I also had a horse named George Bush at one point.

64
00:03:54,043 --> 00:03:54,483
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, you did.

65
00:03:54,543 --> 00:03:55,844
[SPEAKER_04]: Because, you know, so I could whip him.

66
00:03:56,364 --> 00:03:56,764
[SPEAKER_04]: It was fun.

67
00:03:57,445 --> 00:04:00,887
[SPEAKER_05]: The other horse racing game I like was Daytona.

68
00:04:01,229 --> 00:04:03,611
[SPEAKER_05]: Remember Daytona and the horse code that they had?

69
00:04:04,432 --> 00:04:10,939
[SPEAKER_04]: What was the game that they used to have at the bowling alley here in town where you would ride the horse humping machine?

70
00:04:10,979 --> 00:04:11,619
[SPEAKER_04]: What was that?

71
00:04:12,761 --> 00:04:13,782
[SPEAKER_05]: Final Furlong.

72
00:04:13,882 --> 00:04:14,903
[SPEAKER_04]: Final Furlong!

73
00:04:15,043 --> 00:04:17,005
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, God, that game was hilarious.

74
00:04:17,705 --> 00:04:19,507
[SPEAKER_05]: I think they still have that game, to be honest.

75
00:04:19,687 --> 00:04:20,008
[SPEAKER_03]: Really?

76
00:04:20,028 --> 00:04:21,850
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't see it when I was there a couple weeks ago.

77
00:04:21,990 --> 00:04:23,571
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I know they had it at one time.

78
00:04:23,611 --> 00:04:25,253
[SPEAKER_05]: They had it at Paradise Island.

79
00:04:25,757 --> 00:04:26,378
[SPEAKER_05]: I love Prop Cycle!

80
00:04:43,311 --> 00:04:44,431
[SPEAKER_04]: Prop Cycle's cool, though.

81
00:04:44,471 --> 00:04:45,872
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a good laugh.

82
00:04:46,772 --> 00:04:53,314
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to position myself next to the back of the bike and feel the breeze, especially after a game of DDR.

83
00:04:53,714 --> 00:04:55,934
[SPEAKER_03]: I worked at a Namco arcade when Prop Cycle came out.

84
00:04:55,974 --> 00:04:57,495
[SPEAKER_03]: My boss played it.

85
00:04:57,535 --> 00:04:58,615
[SPEAKER_03]: They're early to play it.

86
00:04:58,855 --> 00:05:04,676
[SPEAKER_05]: I actually do have Prop Cycle in the main cabinet, and sadly enough, something's lost in the transition.

87
00:05:04,796 --> 00:05:06,837
[SPEAKER_04]: It is not the same.

88
00:05:06,877 --> 00:05:09,158
[SPEAKER_04]: Prop Cycle's one of those games that cannot be emulated.

89
00:05:09,278 --> 00:05:10,838
[SPEAKER_03]: You can hook up an exercise bike to it.

90
00:05:11,198 --> 00:05:12,299
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

91
00:05:39,554 --> 00:05:40,676
[SPEAKER_04]: God bless Dave and Busters.

92
00:05:40,916 --> 00:05:45,243
[SPEAKER_04]: A place where you can drink and then play the games, even though the games are extremely overpriced, as are the drinks.

93
00:05:45,524 --> 00:05:45,884
[SPEAKER_04]: Still fun.

94
00:05:46,425 --> 00:05:49,951
[SPEAKER_03]: One thing, though, in the defensive final furlong is that it's a really good ab workout.

95
00:05:51,674 --> 00:05:52,034
[SPEAKER_05]: It is.

96
00:05:52,475 --> 00:05:53,737
[SPEAKER_05]: I got very tired playing that game.

97
00:05:54,689 --> 00:05:57,891
[SPEAKER_04]: Anything else you've been playing besides Derby Owner's Club and your horse, I Eat Children?

98
00:05:57,911 --> 00:06:00,873
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's see, what else have I been playing?

99
00:06:03,755 --> 00:06:07,157
[SPEAKER_05]: Really, I haven't been playing anything other than that, I don't think.

100
00:06:08,118 --> 00:06:10,359
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, we played a little bit of the guy game this week.

101
00:06:10,439 --> 00:06:11,900
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, damn you, I was going to bring that up.

102
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,381
[SPEAKER_04]: Me and Loki were playing the guy game this week.

103
00:06:16,042 --> 00:06:17,123
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll let you talk about it.

104
00:06:17,323 --> 00:06:18,504
[SPEAKER_05]: All I will say is I played the game.

105
00:06:19,409 --> 00:06:20,529
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, I'll finish.

106
00:06:20,790 --> 00:06:28,012
[SPEAKER_04]: I was playing the game, and you know, some folks may be surprised by that statement because I know the rumors that are going around about me, and they're all true.

107
00:06:28,913 --> 00:06:29,613
[SPEAKER_04]: But you know what?

108
00:06:29,893 --> 00:06:32,234
[SPEAKER_04]: Playing those kinds of games are fun once in a while, damn it.

109
00:06:33,774 --> 00:06:35,235
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, you get to see boobs, and that's funny.

110
00:06:35,655 --> 00:06:40,977
[SPEAKER_04]: So we were playing this game, and man, the girl that I decided to play as, she was so ugly.

111
00:06:41,793 --> 00:06:42,753
[SPEAKER_04]: So ugly.

112
00:06:43,413 --> 00:06:44,193
[SPEAKER_04]: And I won.

113
00:06:44,273 --> 00:06:46,054
[SPEAKER_04]: So my girl got to do a lap dance at the end.

114
00:06:46,074 --> 00:06:47,414
[SPEAKER_04]: And everybody was like, God, no.

115
00:06:47,614 --> 00:06:56,036
[SPEAKER_05]: As I put it earlier in the other show, she was a cross between, I would say, Tori Spelling and Bea Arthur.

116
00:06:56,756 --> 00:06:57,416
[SPEAKER_03]: So it was China.

117
00:06:58,876 --> 00:07:00,997
[SPEAKER_04]: Kind of, except like, you know, blonde.

118
00:07:01,197 --> 00:07:03,397
[SPEAKER_05]: She had the Tori Spelling horse face.

119
00:07:03,457 --> 00:07:07,318
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's this one thing, picture of her where she's wearing like an orange nightie.

120
00:07:07,678 --> 00:07:08,958
[SPEAKER_04]: And it looks like she just ate a baby.

121
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:10,140
[SPEAKER_04]: It really does.

122
00:07:10,401 --> 00:07:16,385
[SPEAKER_05]: Because she spread it out, and it's sort of like the color, because it wasn't too crisp of color.

123
00:07:16,465 --> 00:07:19,547
[SPEAKER_05]: It kind of matched her skin color, so it looked like she just blew up.

124
00:07:21,168 --> 00:07:27,152
[SPEAKER_04]: And I remember exclaiming, oh my god, she exploded, and Loki's girlfriend was just in stitches for like 15 minutes.

125
00:07:27,172 --> 00:07:27,753
[SPEAKER_04]: It was funny.

126
00:07:28,653 --> 00:07:29,874
[SPEAKER_04]: So was I. It was funny.

127
00:07:29,914 --> 00:07:31,035
[SPEAKER_03]: Sounds riotous.

128
00:07:32,391 --> 00:07:35,015
[SPEAKER_04]: Too bad there's not going to be a sequel because of that lawsuit and everything.

129
00:07:35,115 --> 00:07:35,756
[SPEAKER_04]: That makes me sad.

130
00:07:35,776 --> 00:07:36,557
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I'm sure there will be.

131
00:07:36,697 --> 00:07:38,240
[SPEAKER_04]: But they got the lawsuit!

132
00:07:38,260 --> 00:07:43,828
[SPEAKER_05]: They're still going to do it, I bet you, because they'll probably say, oh, well, you know, breach of contract.

133
00:07:44,790 --> 00:07:45,651
[SPEAKER_05]: or whatever you know.

134
00:07:46,351 --> 00:07:47,752
[SPEAKER_05]: There's got to be some sort of protection.

135
00:07:47,772 --> 00:07:55,477
[SPEAKER_03]: They can't do breach of contract because any contract created with a minor is voidable.

136
00:07:55,497 --> 00:07:59,439
[SPEAKER_05]: What kind of protection do companies have against people that are going to be lying to them?

137
00:07:59,579 --> 00:08:02,921
[SPEAKER_03]: The contract is still voidable whether they know the age or not.

138
00:08:02,961 --> 00:08:08,064
[SPEAKER_03]: If they are of the age of minority within their state, then there technically is no contract.

139
00:08:08,104 --> 00:08:08,484
[SPEAKER_05]: That's true.

140
00:08:09,485 --> 00:08:10,926
[SPEAKER_03]: Legally, there is not a contract.

141
00:08:10,946 --> 00:08:12,647
[SPEAKER_05]: I think they could probably still sue them.

142
00:08:13,371 --> 00:08:15,493
[SPEAKER_03]: They can't see there, but they can take a suit.

143
00:08:16,714 --> 00:08:20,917
[SPEAKER_03]: What was the... There is a suit they could probably take against their parents for allowing the...

144
00:08:22,612 --> 00:08:24,854
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

145
00:08:45,813 --> 00:08:49,115
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know, but couldn't they, like, you know, take losses or something?

146
00:08:49,455 --> 00:08:54,078
[SPEAKER_05]: Couldn't they blame the losses of this game because they had to pull it off the shelves on these parents?

147
00:08:54,158 --> 00:08:54,718
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what?

148
00:08:55,059 --> 00:08:58,300
[SPEAKER_04]: Long story short, it's too hard to see the boobs in that game anyway.

149
00:08:58,340 --> 00:09:00,602
[SPEAKER_04]: Seriously, you gotta cheat if you really want to see the boobs.

150
00:09:00,882 --> 00:09:02,723
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, I mean, come on.

151
00:09:02,763 --> 00:09:03,984
[SPEAKER_04]: You're not ever gonna see the boobs.

152
00:09:04,024 --> 00:09:05,985
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't even realize it, though, when we played...

153
00:09:06,645 --> 00:09:10,229
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, yesterday, I thought there was like three different sets of pictures.

154
00:09:10,650 --> 00:09:14,094
[SPEAKER_05]: Then I went and scrolled down, there was like a good seven or eight sets.

155
00:09:14,154 --> 00:09:15,516
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm like, holy crap!

156
00:09:15,956 --> 00:09:17,578
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm like, I have to go through all of this?

157
00:09:17,598 --> 00:09:18,679
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that was a lot of boobs.

158
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:20,081
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, let's move on.

159
00:09:20,481 --> 00:09:23,865
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's change the topic to something else that is completely on another topic.

160
00:09:24,225 --> 00:09:27,109
[SPEAKER_04]: Completely from boobs to the family-friendly Nintendo.

161
00:09:28,058 --> 00:09:43,969
[SPEAKER_04]: Now we've kind of been speculating that Nintendo's going to do this for quite some time, but they're actually going to do this new thing with the DS, and they're going to start testing this in Japan, where you can actually use these kiosks in selected stores around Japan, and you can download things to your DS.

162
00:09:44,369 --> 00:09:48,552
[SPEAKER_04]: Which, you know, duh, we kind of suspected something like this would happen for a while, it's just a, you know...

163
00:09:49,421 --> 00:09:51,682
[SPEAKER_04]: An obvious side effect of the technology.

164
00:09:52,103 --> 00:09:53,163
[SPEAKER_04]: It is an awesome idea.

165
00:09:53,483 --> 00:09:54,184
[SPEAKER_04]: And this is the cool thing.

166
00:09:54,204 --> 00:09:57,245
[SPEAKER_04]: You're going to be able to download demos onto your DS.

167
00:09:57,626 --> 00:10:08,271
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you ever walked into like a GameStop and you've been wanting to play the demo that's there but some damn seven-year-old kid's been sitting on there for the past two hours while his mom's in Victoria's Secret or something and left her kid in GameStop.

168
00:10:09,352 --> 00:10:11,633
[SPEAKER_04]: And you've been wanting to play the demo but the damn kid won't get off.

169
00:10:11,693 --> 00:10:13,334
[SPEAKER_04]: Well now you won't have to worry about that stuff anymore.

170
00:10:13,574 --> 00:10:18,497
[SPEAKER_04]: You just download the DS demo right onto your DS and you could just walk out the store and play it in the food court.

171
00:10:19,105 --> 00:10:21,728
[SPEAKER_04]: As long as you don't turn your DS off, you can still have that demo.

172
00:10:22,268 --> 00:10:25,572
[SPEAKER_03]: They actually sort of did that with the GBA, like in Animal Crossing.

173
00:10:26,233 --> 00:10:26,753
[SPEAKER_04]: Kind of, yeah.

174
00:10:26,833 --> 00:10:32,960
[SPEAKER_03]: You could play the game on your GBA, but if you turned it off, you lost it of course.

175
00:10:33,188 --> 00:10:35,349
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's probably where this idea started to stem from.

176
00:10:35,409 --> 00:10:38,269
[SPEAKER_04]: Because, unfortunately, you had to have the GameCube and the wire and everything.

177
00:10:38,509 --> 00:10:40,290
[SPEAKER_04]: But now that we got Bluetooth and wireless, hey.

178
00:10:40,310 --> 00:10:54,093
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, that is also, from what I hear, that's what they're doing with the Nintendo Revolution system, the brand new console system that they're going to be unveiling, is the connectivity with that is going to be similar to what the Advance was with the GameCube.

179
00:10:54,313 --> 00:10:55,513
[SPEAKER_04]: I would be shocked.

180
00:10:55,794 --> 00:11:01,455
[SPEAKER_04]: I would be absolutely shocked if the Revolution did not have some type of Bluetooth...

181
00:11:02,342 --> 00:11:03,924
[SPEAKER_04]: All their controllers are wireless.

182
00:11:03,944 --> 00:11:04,925
[SPEAKER_05]: They're all going to be wireless.

183
00:11:04,945 --> 00:11:06,126
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, that's not a bad idea either, honestly.

184
00:11:06,166 --> 00:11:07,867
[SPEAKER_05]: It's time for that to happen too.

185
00:11:07,887 --> 00:11:09,789
[SPEAKER_05]: So we can lose the controllers right along with the remotes, honestly.

186
00:11:09,809 --> 00:11:12,071
[SPEAKER_05]: It's time for that to start happening.

187
00:11:29,524 --> 00:11:33,188
[SPEAKER_04]: What's also interesting is the game Jam with the Band.

188
00:11:33,488 --> 00:11:34,910
[SPEAKER_04]: There's this game they have in Japan.

189
00:11:34,930 --> 00:11:35,870
[SPEAKER_04]: They don't have it here yet.

190
00:11:35,910 --> 00:11:38,273
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't remember if they have plans to bring this over here yet or not.

191
00:11:38,613 --> 00:11:43,638
[SPEAKER_04]: But you can actually download additional music for this game via the kiosks.

192
00:11:43,978 --> 00:11:46,621
[SPEAKER_04]: And it saves to your DS somehow.

193
00:11:46,661 --> 00:11:51,586
[SPEAKER_04]: And I never knew the DS had a type of drive in it, but it must have some type of memory flash or something because...

194
00:11:52,046 --> 00:11:53,888
[SPEAKER_04]: The information will actually save.

195
00:11:54,209 --> 00:11:58,013
[SPEAKER_04]: But I guess if you think about it, Loki, aren't the games just on flashcards anyway?

196
00:11:58,433 --> 00:12:02,818
[SPEAKER_04]: So maybe when you're downloading the information, it's going right onto the game?

197
00:12:03,078 --> 00:12:04,199
[SPEAKER_04]: I have no idea how that works.

198
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:05,821
[SPEAKER_04]: Enlighten me, TechMassa.

199
00:12:06,822 --> 00:12:07,263
[SPEAKER_04]: I have no idea.

200
00:12:07,283 --> 00:12:07,603
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry.

201
00:12:07,643 --> 00:12:09,245
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm being distracted by Tekken 5 here.

202
00:12:09,385 --> 00:12:10,266
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, we're going to turn that off.

203
00:12:10,406 --> 00:12:11,067
[SPEAKER_04]: That's alright.

204
00:12:11,548 --> 00:12:11,828
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

205
00:12:12,665 --> 00:12:15,166
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, then I suppose we will get into Tekken 5 news.

206
00:12:15,186 --> 00:12:16,146
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's talk about Tekken 5.

207
00:12:16,466 --> 00:12:17,687
[SPEAKER_04]: Tekken 5 is out.

208
00:12:18,467 --> 00:12:21,068
[SPEAKER_04]: It really just kind of came out in the middle of nowhere.

209
00:12:21,428 --> 00:12:23,148
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, I remember mentioning it.

210
00:12:23,328 --> 00:12:24,489
[SPEAKER_03]: It came out Friday.

211
00:12:25,089 --> 00:12:28,370
[SPEAKER_04]: But really, it was like, dang, all of a sudden Tekken 5's out.

212
00:12:28,690 --> 00:12:30,790
[SPEAKER_04]: And here's the crazy thing about Tekken 5.

213
00:12:31,891 --> 00:12:35,712
[SPEAKER_04]: It's got Tekken 1, 2, and 3 all in it.

214
00:12:36,052 --> 00:12:38,413
[SPEAKER_03]: And, and, and, and Starblade.

215
00:12:39,213 --> 00:12:40,253
[SPEAKER_04]: That's so cool.

216
00:12:41,254 --> 00:12:41,874
[SPEAKER_03]: You know how...

217
00:12:42,887 --> 00:13:03,236
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it was Tekken, the first Tekken or Tekken 2 had like a Galaga Yeah For the loading game That's right This one has freaking Starblade as the loading game Talk about a step up there That's pretty cool Ridge Racer had Galaga Huh But a lot of the Namco games had loading games

218
00:13:03,726 --> 00:13:04,307
[SPEAKER_04]: Interesting.

219
00:13:04,447 --> 00:13:06,468
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, have you gotten a chance to play much Tekken 5 at all yet?

220
00:13:07,309 --> 00:13:09,551
[SPEAKER_03]: I unwrapped it before we walked out of the door, literally.

221
00:13:09,771 --> 00:13:10,232
[SPEAKER_04]: Gotcha.

222
00:13:10,352 --> 00:13:12,774
[SPEAKER_04]: So you haven't really had a chance to, but you played the arcade version.

223
00:13:13,294 --> 00:13:14,656
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I played it in Alabama.

224
00:13:15,536 --> 00:13:24,845
[SPEAKER_03]: The only arcades in my hometown are Namco arcades, unless you count Ground Zero, and that's just privately owned.

225
00:13:25,505 --> 00:13:30,850
[SPEAKER_03]: But the first thing I did was make a beeline to Tekken 5, because Tekken 5 had just recently come out.

226
00:13:31,368 --> 00:13:35,149
[SPEAKER_03]: in California, but it had been out at all the Namco arcades ages ago.

227
00:13:35,690 --> 00:13:36,630
[SPEAKER_03]: So no one was there.

228
00:13:36,670 --> 00:13:38,151
[SPEAKER_03]: I got to play it as much as I wanted to.

229
00:13:39,931 --> 00:13:40,352
[SPEAKER_04]: Very cool.

230
00:13:41,872 --> 00:13:45,053
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, so I'm looking forward to playing this game.

231
00:13:45,073 --> 00:13:47,814
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll give you a full review on Tekken 5 as soon as I can.

232
00:13:47,994 --> 00:13:48,415
[SPEAKER_04]: Next week.

233
00:13:48,575 --> 00:13:49,395
[SPEAKER_04]: Next week, yes.

234
00:13:49,575 --> 00:13:50,355
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki and I will both.

235
00:13:50,976 --> 00:13:52,536
[SPEAKER_04]: We will duel to the death on Tekken 5.

236
00:13:52,676 --> 00:13:54,397
[SPEAKER_03]: I suck at Tekken, so that'll be great.

237
00:13:55,035 --> 00:13:56,116
[SPEAKER_03]: I get to own you both.

238
00:13:56,236 --> 00:13:57,497
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not that great at Tekken.

239
00:13:57,517 --> 00:13:59,418
[SPEAKER_04]: Jamie will kick both our asses, honestly.

240
00:13:59,819 --> 00:14:02,921
[SPEAKER_04]: I like Huarong because he has this really cheap move I always do with him.

241
00:14:03,221 --> 00:14:03,822
[SPEAKER_04]: Is he in Tekken 5?

242
00:14:04,282 --> 00:14:04,482
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

243
00:14:04,622 --> 00:14:05,122
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, he better be.

244
00:14:05,223 --> 00:14:05,423
[SPEAKER_04]: Good.

245
00:14:05,523 --> 00:14:05,763
[SPEAKER_04]: Yay.

246
00:14:05,923 --> 00:14:06,223
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm saved.

247
00:14:06,243 --> 00:14:08,005
[SPEAKER_03]: And, of course, my man Gene is in there.

248
00:14:09,205 --> 00:14:12,428
[SPEAKER_04]: You can tell I'm such a Tekken 5 noob and I have not touched the arcade version yet.

249
00:14:12,448 --> 00:14:14,890
[SPEAKER_04]: But, seriously, every time I want to go play in the arcade, huge line.

250
00:14:14,970 --> 00:14:15,290
[SPEAKER_04]: Huge.

251
00:14:16,911 --> 00:14:17,631
[SPEAKER_03]: I have my card.

252
00:14:17,651 --> 00:14:19,673
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't been able to use it since I came back in the States.

253
00:14:20,662 --> 00:14:30,729
[SPEAKER_04]: It kind of doesn't seem like there was much time between the arcade release and the home release, but I guess what you're saying about the Namco... I remember the little movie at E3, and then, bam, arcade, whoa.

254
00:14:30,769 --> 00:14:32,691
[SPEAKER_04]: Bam, arcade, and then, bam, home version.

255
00:14:32,771 --> 00:14:33,391
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like, yeesh.

256
00:14:35,173 --> 00:14:35,493
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

257
00:14:36,654 --> 00:14:40,037
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's go ahead and move on to one other quick story.

258
00:14:40,217 --> 00:14:41,498
[SPEAKER_04]: Very interesting announcement.

259
00:14:41,538 --> 00:14:44,840
[SPEAKER_04]: We've had something Nintendo and something Sony with Tekken.

260
00:14:44,860 --> 00:14:46,882
[SPEAKER_04]: Now let's get to something Xbox, Microsoft.

261
00:14:47,975 --> 00:14:58,700
[SPEAKER_04]: Hironobu Sakaguchi has joined up with Microsoft to develop role playing game video games exclusively for the upcoming next gen Xbox system.

262
00:14:58,780 --> 00:15:00,201
[SPEAKER_04]: Why is this such a big deal?

263
00:15:00,641 --> 00:15:05,644
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, if you didn't recognize the name, Sakaguchi is the creator of the Final Fantasy franchise.

264
00:15:07,104 --> 00:15:07,805
[SPEAKER_04]: Very interesting.

265
00:15:07,905 --> 00:15:08,505
[SPEAKER_04]: Good for them.

266
00:15:08,825 --> 00:15:11,426
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd like to see them expand on games like Fable.

267
00:15:13,748 --> 00:15:16,549
[SPEAKER_04]: The Xbox needs some

268
00:15:17,663 --> 00:15:37,349
[SPEAKER_04]: like different variety kinds of games I think I think Fable was a good place for the Xbox to go despite how you might feel about that game it was kind of like what is the Xbox really freaking lacking oh a good RPG well finally you get Fable way later so I think this is a good direction for Microsoft to be looking into so just my thought I don't know any other thoughts from you guys

269
00:15:39,266 --> 00:16:04,141
[SPEAKER_04]: I could definitely hopefully they're gonna be making some good games maybe an online game I would hope for an online game I don't know about MMO because I'm kind of headed up to here with MMOs but I don't know I guess that's where the money's at right I'll wait and see wait and see all right now of course we here at Orange Lounge Radio we're not just here to fill you in on all the video game news that doesn't suck but we're here to better your lives as well

270
00:16:04,979 --> 00:16:09,021
[SPEAKER_04]: What better way to do that than allow Jamie to give you her advice column.

271
00:16:09,061 --> 00:16:17,764
[SPEAKER_04]: So, DarkSakura, turn that anger that you usually have on our three-hour program at OrangeLaunchRadio.com and turn it into a little bit of love for our listeners.

272
00:16:22,646 --> 00:16:27,027
[SPEAKER_03]: I swear to you people, I give you good advice and you never follow it.

273
00:16:27,307 --> 00:16:29,248
[SPEAKER_04]: Did someone fail a lie detector test last week?

274
00:16:30,242 --> 00:16:31,043
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess so.

275
00:16:31,563 --> 00:16:32,804
[SPEAKER_03]: We have a bunch of liars listening.

276
00:16:32,824 --> 00:16:34,886
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, and his name is Mr. Jackson.

277
00:16:36,627 --> 00:16:40,490
[SPEAKER_03]: Today's advice is how to get to the surface if your scuba tank runs out of air.

278
00:16:41,771 --> 00:16:44,834
[SPEAKER_03]: Number one, signal to your fellow divers that you are having a problem.

279
00:16:44,894 --> 00:16:46,315
[SPEAKER_03]: Point to your tank or regulator.

280
00:16:47,416 --> 00:16:49,718
[SPEAKER_04]: Now that's just common sense, Jamie.

281
00:16:50,719 --> 00:16:51,819
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, I need to hear the other steps.

282
00:16:51,900 --> 00:16:52,360
[SPEAKER_03]: Number two,

283
00:16:53,078 --> 00:16:58,020
[SPEAKER_03]: If someone comes to your aid, share his or her regulator passing it back and forth while swimming slowly to the surface.

284
00:16:59,001 --> 00:16:58,020
3.

285
00:16:59,441 --> 00:17:04,043
[SPEAKER_03]: If no one can help you, keep your regulator in your mouth as air may expand in the tank as you ascend.

286
00:17:04,463 --> 00:17:07,045
[SPEAKER_03]: Look straight up so that your airway is as straight as possible.

287
00:17:07,065 --> 00:17:07,045
4.

288
00:17:10,486 --> 00:17:13,388
[SPEAKER_03]: Swim to the surface at a moderate rate.

289
00:17:13,588 --> 00:17:18,810
[SPEAKER_03]: Exhale continuously as you swim up, but do not exhaust all of your air in the first few seconds of your ascent.

290
00:17:19,331 --> 00:17:22,132
[SPEAKER_03]: If you do not exhale continuously, you risk an aneurysm.

291
00:17:24,998 --> 00:17:28,339
[SPEAKER_03]: And another bit of the thing to add to that, just don't go scuba diving.

292
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:38,381
[SPEAKER_03]: If people were meant to swim that deep, they'd have gills, like in Waterworld.

293
00:17:40,181 --> 00:17:43,981
[SPEAKER_05]: Or if you go scuba diving, go down like maybe 20 feet at the most.

294
00:17:44,181 --> 00:17:44,782
[SPEAKER_03]: Use a snorkel.

295
00:17:44,942 --> 00:17:46,642
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you actually see the Waterworld movie?

296
00:17:46,722 --> 00:17:46,842
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

297
00:17:46,902 --> 00:17:47,462
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, okay.

298
00:17:47,982 --> 00:17:48,662
[SPEAKER_03]: I know they had gills.

299
00:17:50,062 --> 00:17:50,743
[SPEAKER_04]: I know it sucked.

300
00:17:51,743 --> 00:17:52,863
[SPEAKER_03]: Kevin Costner, of course.

301
00:17:53,669 --> 00:17:58,411
[SPEAKER_04]: I know I just made a comment about not wanting to talk about MMOs, but I had to mention this one.

302
00:17:59,812 --> 00:18:10,216
[SPEAKER_04]: Anarchy Online players will soon be seeing advertisements on billboards that are stationed in central regions of the game's landscape.

303
00:18:10,896 --> 00:18:19,640
[SPEAKER_04]: They're teaming up with New York City-based Massive, the folks that create Anarchy Online, and they are going to be putting ads inside the game.

304
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:22,041
[SPEAKER_04]: What do you think about ads in MMOs?

305
00:18:23,143 --> 00:18:25,804
[SPEAKER_04]: I hear, though, the game's gonna go free, I think.

306
00:18:25,884 --> 00:18:48,895
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess, now, that would make sense, why there's ads in it, I suppose, but seriously, after the news that we got about the Slash Pizza in EverQuest 2 last week with the Pizza Hut, I mean, this is a totally obvious... To be honest, I mean, in a game like that, I don't really, I haven't ever played Anarchy Online, but if it's on billboards or something, I really don't see that deterring away from the game really that much.

307
00:18:49,475 --> 00:18:49,735
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean...

308
00:18:50,703 --> 00:18:53,444
[SPEAKER_03]: If it were in Final Fantasy XI, though, that would totally detract.

309
00:18:53,584 --> 00:18:55,645
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that would make more sense.

310
00:18:56,166 --> 00:19:04,810
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't wait for the day when I go into one of my Burning Circle Notorious Monster Battles and it's like, Pepsi presents the Burning Circle Battle!

311
00:19:05,250 --> 00:19:08,492
[SPEAKER_04]: Britney Spears coming out singing a song, and then you get to attack the monster.

312
00:19:08,572 --> 00:19:09,792
[SPEAKER_04]: Who is Britney Spears, actually?

313
00:19:09,952 --> 00:19:14,995
[SPEAKER_03]: I can understand something like that, say, in Matrix Online, where you're going to have billboards and ads.

314
00:19:15,595 --> 00:19:18,036
[SPEAKER_03]: In that type of environment, something like that would make sense.

315
00:19:18,156 --> 00:19:19,217
[SPEAKER_03]: That would actually be

316
00:19:20,140 --> 00:19:23,942
[SPEAKER_05]: PowerAid, just like in the game.

317
00:19:25,683 --> 00:19:30,686
[SPEAKER_03]: That would actually be a good way to get a little bit of extra money in there.

318
00:19:31,306 --> 00:19:34,308
[SPEAKER_03]: I wouldn't see it in Ragnarok Online.

319
00:19:35,809 --> 00:19:46,434
[SPEAKER_05]: To be honest, if they're going to put ads in a game and then they're going to say, I don't know, make it free or reduce the fees it's going to cost every month, of course you're going to get people that are going to be like, fuck that, I don't care.

320
00:19:46,535 --> 00:19:47,335
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, as long as I don't...

321
00:19:48,361 --> 00:19:51,942
[SPEAKER_04]: As long as it's not pop-ups, because I fucking hate pop-ups.

322
00:19:52,002 --> 00:19:53,423
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, that's going to deter from the game.

323
00:19:54,363 --> 00:19:56,664
[SPEAKER_05]: It's all about gameplay and these things.

324
00:19:57,064 --> 00:20:02,626
[SPEAKER_05]: Otherwise, you're going to get people not going to shell out the 20 bucks or whatever it is a month to play these things.

325
00:20:03,246 --> 00:20:05,867
[SPEAKER_05]: So, why not?

326
00:20:06,228 --> 00:20:07,348
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't see a problem with it.

327
00:20:07,588 --> 00:20:12,050
[SPEAKER_05]: And Anarchy Online seems like, to me, it's a pretty dynamic game as it is.

328
00:20:12,610 --> 00:20:14,250
[SPEAKER_05]: Pretty futuristic and stuff.

329
00:20:14,290 --> 00:20:15,651
[SPEAKER_05]: So, I guess it could fit.

330
00:20:16,317 --> 00:20:17,438
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, and a few billboards.

331
00:20:17,478 --> 00:20:17,918
[SPEAKER_05]: Who cares?

332
00:20:17,978 --> 00:20:22,082
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, whether it be some generic thing that doesn't exist or an actual product, who cares?

333
00:20:22,682 --> 00:20:24,884
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, it doesn't detract from the game that much.

334
00:20:24,944 --> 00:20:27,306
[SPEAKER_05]: And even if they have like, you know, what is it?

335
00:20:27,366 --> 00:20:33,090
[SPEAKER_05]: Like maybe even vending machines or something that we're like strewn about, you know, or other crap, you know, product placement and stuff.

336
00:20:33,491 --> 00:20:34,331
[SPEAKER_05]: It really doesn't matter.

337
00:20:34,451 --> 00:20:37,454
[SPEAKER_04]: How about like in Duke Nukem 3D where I could blow those vending machines up?

338
00:20:38,368 --> 00:20:39,028
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't like this ad!

339
00:20:39,048 --> 00:20:41,070
[SPEAKER_05]: We shall see how far they take this idea, because...

340
00:21:03,473 --> 00:21:05,054
[SPEAKER_04]: Anything they can advertise on, they'll do it.

341
00:21:05,074 --> 00:21:09,895
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm still waiting for my slash pizza and slash porn, but, you know, no luck yet.

342
00:21:10,455 --> 00:21:10,795
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

343
00:21:11,615 --> 00:21:12,596
[SPEAKER_04]: Back to Nintendo.

344
00:21:12,656 --> 00:21:19,658
[SPEAKER_04]: They're going to be releasing a whole lot of titles in May, including Pokemon Emerald and Fire Emblem, the Sacred Stones.

345
00:21:20,298 --> 00:21:24,339
[SPEAKER_04]: Also coming out in May, Donkey Konga 2 and Geist.

346
00:21:25,459 --> 00:21:28,100
[SPEAKER_04]: And any of those games going to be on the DS?

347
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:28,460
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

348
00:21:29,244 --> 00:21:38,226
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, no, they are all being released for the... Not Pokemon... I'm sorry, Pokemon Emerald and Fire Emblem, of course, are Game Boy Advance titles.

349
00:21:38,706 --> 00:21:40,906
[SPEAKER_04]: Donkey Konga 2 and Geist, GameCube titles.

350
00:21:41,286 --> 00:21:43,487
[SPEAKER_05]: Shocking, no DS titles.

351
00:21:43,927 --> 00:21:46,207
[SPEAKER_05]: Wow, only one in February.

352
00:21:46,727 --> 00:21:51,988
[SPEAKER_05]: Gee, I don't think the PSP is going to blow them out of the water when it fucking gets released.

353
00:21:52,568 --> 00:21:53,729
[SPEAKER_03]: You mean the Great Game Shooter?

354
00:21:54,169 --> 00:21:55,309
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, the Great Game Shooter.

355
00:21:56,400 --> 00:22:01,070
[SPEAKER_04]: Pokemon Emerald, of course, being the next saga in the... It's another Pokemon game.

356
00:22:01,110 --> 00:22:01,951
[SPEAKER_04]: What else do I need to say?

357
00:22:02,032 --> 00:22:03,174
[SPEAKER_04]: It's another freaking Pokemon game.

358
00:22:04,919 --> 00:22:10,182
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I remember another console system a while back that actually had pretty good graphics but no games for it.

359
00:22:10,463 --> 00:22:12,424
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if anyone remembers the Atari Lynx.

360
00:22:13,004 --> 00:22:13,444
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, yes.

361
00:22:13,665 --> 00:22:14,805
[SPEAKER_03]: Dude, we've got a Lynx.

362
00:22:14,845 --> 00:22:16,406
[SPEAKER_03]: We have a bunch of games for it, too.

363
00:22:16,426 --> 00:22:17,367
[SPEAKER_04]: You have everything.

364
00:22:17,407 --> 00:22:19,608
[SPEAKER_04]: Just because you own it doesn't mean it was successful.

365
00:22:19,668 --> 00:22:20,409
[SPEAKER_04]: You have everything.

366
00:22:20,449 --> 00:22:25,152
[SPEAKER_03]: The Lynx was awesome, and it had that great commercial where the kids snuck out of class to sit in the bathroom to play it.

367
00:22:25,372 --> 00:22:27,053
[SPEAKER_04]: And the Lynx had Tempest 2000, which was rad.

368
00:22:27,073 --> 00:22:30,075
[SPEAKER_05]: My point being, though, is that if they... Oh, no, never mind.

369
00:22:30,595 --> 00:22:33,477
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm getting the Lynx... No, I'm getting the Lynx mixed up with the Jaguar.

370
00:22:33,993 --> 00:22:36,894
[SPEAKER_03]: That's... See, that's how much I played these systems.

371
00:22:37,514 --> 00:22:37,715
[SPEAKER_04]: What?

372
00:22:39,835 --> 00:22:43,537
[SPEAKER_03]: If I had a ruler and was a nun, you'd be in trouble.

373
00:22:43,617 --> 00:22:44,077
[SPEAKER_03]: Whatever.

374
00:22:44,377 --> 00:22:50,079
[SPEAKER_05]: The point being is the fact that they have the lack of games is going to kill that system, sadly enough.

375
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:56,742
[SPEAKER_05]: They really need to get on the ball here with getting even third-party... But it can play the Advance games.

376
00:22:56,802 --> 00:22:57,863
[SPEAKER_03]: You need the Pac-Man Marvel Advance game.

377
00:22:57,883 --> 00:22:58,283
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, goody.

378
00:22:58,543 --> 00:22:58,943
[SPEAKER_05]: Guess what?

379
00:22:59,003 --> 00:23:01,704
[SPEAKER_05]: The Game Boy Advance can play the Game Boy games.

380
00:23:02,124 --> 00:23:02,765
[SPEAKER_05]: But you know what?

381
00:23:02,825 --> 00:23:03,705
[SPEAKER_05]: That doesn't matter.

382
00:23:05,464 --> 00:23:07,305
[SPEAKER_03]: We need Marble Madness.

383
00:23:08,206 --> 00:23:08,787
[SPEAKER_04]: Damn straight.

384
00:23:08,807 --> 00:23:09,727
[SPEAKER_03]: And Crystal Castles.

385
00:23:10,668 --> 00:23:12,630
[SPEAKER_03]: Using the stylus as a trackball.

386
00:23:12,990 --> 00:23:15,732
[SPEAKER_04]: That would be a good idea for Atari or somebody to put out.

387
00:23:15,792 --> 00:23:16,793
[SPEAKER_04]: I believe they're doing that.

388
00:23:16,933 --> 00:23:17,173
[SPEAKER_04]: Good.

389
00:23:17,533 --> 00:23:19,615
[SPEAKER_04]: Smart people.

390
00:23:19,715 --> 00:23:25,659
[SPEAKER_04]: Fire Emblem, of course, is the long-running strategy RPG series, and it'll have new characters, yada yada.

391
00:23:25,700 --> 00:23:29,102
[SPEAKER_04]: Donkey Konga's the game with the bongos, you know, music game, lots of fun.

392
00:23:29,663 --> 00:23:30,143
[SPEAKER_04]: Geist.

393
00:23:30,623 --> 00:23:34,046
[SPEAKER_04]: You will be in the role of a ghost who possesses people.

394
00:23:35,216 --> 00:23:35,617
[SPEAKER_04]: Fire Emblem Wind

395
00:23:47,225 --> 00:23:48,186
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for watching!

396
00:24:06,917 --> 00:24:07,977
[SPEAKER_04]: Little piece of news here.

397
00:24:08,517 --> 00:24:12,959
[SPEAKER_04]: The Fable soundtrack is coming out, or it just came out recently.

398
00:24:13,399 --> 00:24:16,380
[SPEAKER_04]: And it has the Fable theme, which was created by Danny Elfman.

399
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:17,780
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course, you know, oingo boingo.

400
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:24,922
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's being released by Something Else, S-U-M, Something Else Studios.

401
00:24:25,002 --> 00:24:29,063
[SPEAKER_04]: And it has a lot of the score as well by Russell Shaw, which kind of makes me think...

402
00:24:30,046 --> 00:24:32,347
[SPEAKER_04]: Why the hell don't more video games get soundtrack releases?

403
00:24:32,747 --> 00:24:33,128
[SPEAKER_04]: Seriously.

404
00:24:33,148 --> 00:24:35,069
[SPEAKER_03]: They do in Japan, just about every game that comes out.

405
00:24:35,109 --> 00:24:39,411
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, sure, in Japan, but I'm talking about America, so I don't have to pay... It's happening more often.

406
00:24:40,351 --> 00:24:45,334
[SPEAKER_04]: But for games like Fable, what about games like DDR getting full soundtracks?

407
00:24:45,374 --> 00:24:49,896
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess they have the VRairs, I guess, but there's other games with great soundtracks as well.

408
00:24:50,256 --> 00:24:52,177
[SPEAKER_04]: Katamari Damacy, hello.

409
00:24:52,557 --> 00:24:53,898
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that had great music.

410
00:24:54,158 --> 00:24:56,039
[SPEAKER_04]: Where's the domestic soundtrack release?

411
00:24:56,059 --> 00:24:57,640
[SPEAKER_03]: Although, I know that...

412
00:24:59,329 --> 00:25:16,301
[SPEAKER_03]: of course the soundtrack will probably cost as much as the game but hey well there are games that did come out that they put soundtracks out for like I have to think about it actually it's sad you know what they could do well for all of the

413
00:25:18,385 --> 00:25:19,326
[SPEAKER_03]: Grand Theft Auto games.

414
00:25:19,486 --> 00:25:19,746
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

415
00:25:20,006 --> 00:25:20,926
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what they could do, though?

416
00:25:21,427 --> 00:25:27,450
[SPEAKER_05]: Why don't they just release Katamari Damacy Special Edition, including the soundtrack and a poster.

417
00:25:27,850 --> 00:25:28,230
[SPEAKER_05]: Sell it for $30.

418
00:25:28,290 --> 00:25:29,291
[SPEAKER_05]: There you go.

419
00:25:29,351 --> 00:25:29,631
[SPEAKER_05]: Guess what?

420
00:25:29,651 --> 00:25:31,052
[SPEAKER_05]: You made your money and you sold the game again.

421
00:25:31,192 --> 00:25:31,872
[SPEAKER_05]: That's so Nintendo.

422
00:25:31,912 --> 00:25:33,813
[SPEAKER_03]: I could do it in Korea and include an umbrella.

423
00:25:34,314 --> 00:25:35,714
[SPEAKER_05]: Because you know what?

424
00:25:35,734 --> 00:25:37,695
[SPEAKER_05]: People out there are buying Special Editions.

425
00:25:37,735 --> 00:25:40,437
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a brand new thing now that they're doing with all these games that are coming out.

426
00:25:40,537 --> 00:25:41,718
[SPEAKER_04]: Tekken 5 Special Edition, $100.

427
00:25:42,498 --> 00:25:42,978
[SPEAKER_05]: Exactly.

428
00:25:43,158 --> 00:25:44,679
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's just that's the thing.

429
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:47,761
[SPEAKER_05]: If you want your soundtrack, put it in the Special Edition.

430
00:25:48,379 --> 00:25:49,239
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the way to do it.

431
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:51,781
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

432
00:25:51,841 --> 00:25:53,882
[SPEAKER_04]: That's going to wrap it up for tonight's podcast.

433
00:25:53,962 --> 00:25:57,443
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you guys very much for downloading us and staying loyal to our show.

434
00:25:57,463 --> 00:25:58,384
[SPEAKER_04]: We appreciate it.

435
00:25:58,704 --> 00:26:00,304
[SPEAKER_04]: Jamie, any parting words for our listeners tonight?

436
00:26:01,945 --> 00:26:02,145
[SPEAKER_04]: Al.

437
00:26:03,246 --> 00:26:03,546
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki.

438
00:26:04,426 --> 00:26:10,669
[SPEAKER_05]: Altercade trying to copyright MAME is bad.

439
00:26:11,249 --> 00:26:14,391
[SPEAKER_05]: Do not play Altercade and fight this to the death.

440
00:26:15,490 --> 00:26:19,751
[SPEAKER_03]: Not only is it bad, but it's stupid, and they have no legal grounds.

441
00:26:20,131 --> 00:26:22,852
[SPEAKER_05]: It's so bad, it should have its own word.

442
00:26:22,952 --> 00:26:24,973
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like bad wrong, or badong.

443
00:26:26,753 --> 00:26:28,754
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry, that's a Kung Pao reference there.

444
00:26:29,754 --> 00:26:34,876
[SPEAKER_04]: And my final thought, I guess, would be, thou shalt kick an Ultracade machine when you see it.

445
00:26:36,296 --> 00:26:37,457
[SPEAKER_04]: Have a great one, everybody.

446
00:26:37,657 --> 00:26:38,557
