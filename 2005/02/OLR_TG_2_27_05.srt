podcast where we get to talk to you about video games that don't suck and

8
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:36,280
honestly a few that do suck sometimes they just slip in there by chance

9
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:41,560
joining me as always my lovely co-host say hello to dark Sakura Jamie such as

10
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:48,320
relative it is what I may think sucks you may think not sucks like freeze pop

11
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:53,840
don't go there don't go there with me also with us as always the lovable Loki

12
00:00:53,840 --> 00:01:01,700
yes I am you sure are yes I am all right um so let's get right into it what kind

13
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:05,300
of games you've been playing this week what even up to Jamie lots of Final

14
00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:10,060
Fantasy 11 because that's all I've been conscious for I've been oh yes you've

15
00:01:10,060 --> 00:01:14,700
been battling the to sickness this week so disease and that does it kind of help

16
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:19,340
you to just sit there and veg out to the role-playing you're like slash slash

17
00:01:19,340 --> 00:01:25,280
cure cure in your case cure cure actually in my case it's been the order

18
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:33,840
is blind you get your system worked out yeah yeah I have my system worked out

19
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:37,040
sadly but you're much farther in the game this time than you were the first

20
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:42,960
time around so yeah I hit level 10 on my sub job what do you think is doing it

21
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:46,100
for you just the fact that you have more people to play with this time or the

22
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:52,660
fact that I just have people to play with, in general, since I maybe played for three

23
00:01:52,660 --> 00:01:55,660
months and played with people all of twice.

24
00:01:55,660 --> 00:02:01,940
Okay, alright, so that's it, just Final Fantasy XI?

25
00:02:01,940 --> 00:02:03,700
And some guitar freaks.

26
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:06,460
Very cool, just for the heck of it.

27
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:07,860
Because Dan wanted to play.

28
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:08,860
That's a good reason.

29
00:02:08,860 --> 00:02:10,900
Alright, Loki, what have you been playing?

30
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:17,540
I played, well I started off the week trying to get some other games, I played a little

31
00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:24,660
bit of Final Fantasy featuring Charlie's Angels, I mean Final Fantasy X-2, and that lost my

32
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:26,660
interest really quick.

33
00:02:26,660 --> 00:02:33,380
Just too annoying, honestly the voice acting drove me away, it was just, ah, scary.

34
00:02:33,380 --> 00:02:38,740
I couldn't possibly go through that game anymore with Riku yelling some really weird shit,

35
00:02:38,740 --> 00:02:39,740
it's not for me.

36
00:02:39,740 --> 00:02:43,940
So then I went and played a little bit of Derby Owners Club and my horse, i.e.

37
00:02:43,940 --> 00:02:46,340
Children, is doing very well.

38
00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:49,580
Now explain, some folks out there may have never heard of Derby Owners Club because this

39
00:02:49,580 --> 00:02:51,680
podcast goes to a slightly different audience.

40
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:52,900
What is Derby Owners Club all about?

41
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:55,140
Derby Owners Club is this game made by Sega.

42
00:02:55,140 --> 00:02:59,620
It's giant, it's huge, it's a good $100,000 cabinet.

43
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:05,660
Basically what you do is you race and race racing horses and it's pretty much got the

44
00:03:05,660 --> 00:03:11,100
whole jockey thing you train your horses and you you know do the large races and

45
00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:15,760
it's all these two giant screens and you can actually later on the game you can

46
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:20,000
actually retire your horses breed them together and it all uses those magnetic

47
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,820
cards that you might have seen on like you know initial DM you know f0 GX that

48
00:03:24,820 --> 00:03:29,940
type of thing hmm I should scan some of my cards for our listeners you shouldn't

49
00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:34,660
put them on the way because not a lot of people have seen this game I have a

50
00:03:34,660 --> 00:03:39,060
horse named Britney Spears somewhere. She might still be in my wallet. I remember Polteri. Yes, I had a horse named

51
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:46,660
Polteri as well. I have Magical Sound, who's retired. I have Last Message and Shiroi that's an all-white horse, which is

52
00:03:46,660 --> 00:03:56,660
like one of the rarest ones. And I have Gongoro, who's a panda. I also had a horse named George Bush at one point. Yes. Because, you know, so I could whip him. This is fun.

53
00:03:56,660 --> 00:04:03,660
The other horse racing game I like was Daytona. Remember Daytona and the horse code that they had?

54
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:11,660
What was the game that they used to have at the bowling alley here in town where you would ride the horse humping machine? What was that?

55
00:04:11,660 --> 00:04:13,660
That was Final Furlong.

56
00:04:13,660 --> 00:04:16,660
Final Furlong! Oh god, that game was hilarious.

57
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:19,660
I think they still have that game to be honest.

58
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:20,660
Really?

59
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:21,660
I didn't see it when I was there a couple weeks ago.

60
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:26,780
Well, I know they had it at one time they had it at Paradise Island the other arcade near us

61
00:04:26,780 --> 00:04:31,820
Oh, I remember seeing that but I remember the first time I played them like this looks like fun

62
00:04:31,820 --> 00:04:35,720
And it just looks like you're humping the horse. It's just the weirdest thing

63
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:39,740
There's only a few arcade games and when I watch people play it, they make me giggle every time

64
00:04:39,740 --> 00:04:41,860
That's one of them and prop cycles the other ones

65
00:04:42,980 --> 00:04:45,180
Prop cycles cool though. That's like a good laugh

66
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:47,500
I'm on I like when it's I want to sit

67
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:53,140
Kind of position myself next to the back of the bike and like feel the breeze especially after a game of DDR

68
00:04:53,140 --> 00:04:58,580
You know, I worked at a Namco arcade when prop cycle came out. Well, that's my boss. I would get there early to play it

69
00:04:58,580 --> 00:05:04,620
I actually do have prop cycle in the main cabinet and sadly enough something is lost in the transition

70
00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:10,820
It's absolutely it is not the same prop cycles one of those games. It cannot be emulated because it's not exercise bike to it

71
00:05:10,820 --> 00:05:14,180
Maybe now that would work. It doesn't work too. Well, it's kind of

72
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:20,860
of laggy, very very laggy. Well, technology will get better eventually, but it's a great

73
00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:24,420
game. But it just makes me giggle because you've got this person on the bike pedaling

74
00:05:24,420 --> 00:05:26,820
around. It's just a funny thing to see in our game. What about the rowing game at Dave

75
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:30,860
and Busters? That is very cool. I don't even remember the name of that game. It's just

76
00:05:30,860 --> 00:05:37,820
the rowing game. They have that also at Paradise Island. Wow. That's a lot of fun to play,

77
00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:41,500
especially when you've been drinking. God bless Dave and Busters, a place where you

78
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:44,560
can drink and then play games even though the games are extremely overpriced

79
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:48,220
as are the drinks still fun one thing though in the defensive final for long

80
00:05:48,220 --> 00:05:53,740
is that it's a really good out workout it is I got very tired playing that game

81
00:05:53,740 --> 00:05:56,700
all right anything else you've been playing besides Derby owners club and

82
00:05:56,700 --> 00:06:04,080
your horse I eat children um see what else have I been playing really I

83
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:09,260
haven't played anything other than that I don't think oh we played a little bit

84
00:06:09,260 --> 00:06:12,920
the guy game this week. Oh damn you, I was going to bring that up. Me and Loki were playing

85
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:18,280
the guy game this week. Well, I'll let you talk about it. All I will say is I played

86
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:24,420
the game. Alright, I'll fit in. I was playing the game and you know, some folks may be surprised

87
00:06:24,420 --> 00:06:27,480
by that statement because I know the rumors that are going around about me and they're

88
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:33,840
all true. But you know what? Playing those kinds of games are fun once in a while, dammit.

89
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:37,640
You know, you get to see boobs and that's funny. So we were playing this game and man,

90
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:41,840
The girl that I decided to play as, she was so ugly.

91
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:43,440
So ugly.

92
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:47,620
And I won, so my girl got to do a lap dance at the end, and everybody was like, God no!

93
00:06:47,620 --> 00:06:54,280
As I put it earlier in the other show, she was a cross between, um, I would say Tori

94
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:56,760
Spelling and Bea Arthur.

95
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:58,760
So it was China?

96
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:01,240
Kind of, except like, you know, with blonde.

97
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:03,500
She had the Tori Spelling horse face.

98
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:07,220
there's this one thing picture of her where she's wearing like an orange 90

99
00:07:07,220 --> 00:07:11,420
and it looks like she just ate a baby it really does because she spread it out

100
00:07:11,420 --> 00:07:16,500
it's sort of like the color because it was like it wasn't too crisp of color it

101
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:21,300
kind of matched her skin color so it looked like she just blew up and I

102
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:25,700
remember exclaiming oh my god she exploded and Loki's girlfriend was just

103
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:32,500
in stitches for like 15 minutes was funny so was I I was it was funny too

104
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:35,000
bad there's not gonna be a sequel because that lawsuit and everything

105
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:41,020
makes me sad I'm sure there will be the lawsuit I bet you because they'll

106
00:07:41,020 --> 00:07:46,540
probably say oh well you know breach of contract or whatever you know or there's

107
00:07:46,540 --> 00:07:50,660
got to be some sort of protection do breach of contract because any contract

108
00:07:50,660 --> 00:07:56,780
created with a minor is how would you I mean how what kind of protection do

109
00:07:56,780 --> 00:08:00,340
companies have against people that are going to matter to them the contract is

110
00:08:00,340 --> 00:08:04,500
still voidable whether they know the age or not if they are of the age of minority within

111
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:10,120
their state then there is no there technically is no contract that's true legally there is

112
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:14,240
not a contract I think they could probably still sue them they can't see there but they

113
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:19,840
could they can take a suit of there is a suit they could probably take against their parents

114
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:26,520
for allowing the unless she's emancipated but exactly it would be her parents responsibility

115
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:30,040
for letting her go to the spring break, I think, and publicly flash people.

116
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:34,000
And I'm sure they could also, you know, bring up some sort of, well, I don't know, I don't

117
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
know.

118
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Doesn't that be child endangerment?

119
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:41,720
They can't really go against the parents, um, except for, perhaps, expenses, but that's

120
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:42,720
not really it.

121
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:44,500
Um, legally, though, there's nothing the company can do.

122
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:45,500
They were in the wrong.

123
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:46,500
Hmm.

124
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:49,200
I don't know, but couldn't they, like, you know, take losses or something?

125
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:53,060
Couldn't they blame the losses of this game because they had to pull it off the shelves

126
00:08:53,060 --> 00:08:54,200
out on these parents?

127
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:58,280
You know what, long story short, it's too hard to see the boobs in that game anyway.

128
00:08:58,280 --> 00:09:00,920
Seriously, you gotta cheat if you really want to see the boobs.

129
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:03,880
So you know, I mean, come on, you're not ever gonna see this.

130
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:08,720
I didn't even realize it though, when we played, you know, yesterday, I thought there was like

131
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:13,220
three different sets of pictures, then I went and scrolled down, there was like a good seven

132
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:17,480
or eight sets, I'm like, holy crap, I'm like, I have to go through all of this.

133
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:18,800
Yeah, that was a lot of boobs.

134
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:20,600
Alright, let's move on.

135
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:24,760
Let's change the topic to something else that is completely on another topic, completely

136
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:28,120
from boobs to the family-friendly Nintendo.

137
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:31,360
Now we've kind of been speculating that Nintendo's going to do this for quite some time, but

138
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:35,360
they're actually going to do this new thing with the DS, and they're going to start testing

139
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:41,340
this in Japan, where you can actually use these kiosks in selected stores around Japan,

140
00:09:41,340 --> 00:09:46,600
and you can download things to your DS, which, you know, duh, we kind of suspected something

141
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:50,900
like this would happen for a while it's just a you know an obvious side effect

142
00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:54,420
of the technology it is an awesome idea and this is the cool thing you're gonna

143
00:09:54,420 --> 00:09:58,980
be able to download demos onto your DS so if you ever walked in to like a

144
00:09:58,980 --> 00:10:02,380
GameStop and you've been wanting to play the demo that's there but some damn

145
00:10:02,380 --> 00:10:05,540
seven-year-old kids been sitting on there for the past two hours and while

146
00:10:05,540 --> 00:10:08,540
his mom's in Victoria's Secret or something left her kid in GameStop and

147
00:10:08,540 --> 00:10:11,980
you've been wanting to play the demo but the damn kid won't get off well now you

148
00:10:11,980 --> 00:10:15,260
won't have to worry about that stuff anymore you just download the DS demo

149
00:10:15,260 --> 00:10:17,980
right under your DS and you could just walk out the store and play it in the

150
00:10:17,980 --> 00:10:21,380
food court as long as you don't turn your DS off you could still have that

151
00:10:21,380 --> 00:10:26,620
demo they actually sort of did that with the GBA like in Animal Crossing kind of

152
00:10:26,620 --> 00:10:32,020
yeah could play the game on your on your GBA but you know if you turned it off

153
00:10:32,020 --> 00:10:34,780
you lost it of course and that's probably where this idea started to

154
00:10:34,780 --> 00:10:38,020
stem from because unfortunately you had to have the GameCube and the wire and

155
00:10:38,020 --> 00:10:42,180
everything but now that we got bluetooth and wireless hey that is also from what

156
00:10:42,180 --> 00:10:45,920
I hear that's what they're doing with the Nintendo Revolution system, the brand new

157
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:50,160
console system that they're going to be unveiling, is the connectivity with that is going to

158
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:54,120
be similar to what the advance was with the GameCube.

159
00:10:54,120 --> 00:11:00,080
I would be shocked, I would be absolutely shocked if the Revolution did not have some

160
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:03,880
type of Bluetooth thing that will communicate with the DS.

161
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:09,080
Well they were talking about what was, I think it was either a PS3 or Xbox 360 or 2 or whatever

162
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:13,640
the hell they're calling it now, where they were seeing that out of the box, I think it

163
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:19,520
was the Xbox, that all their controllers are wireless. They're all going to be wireless.

164
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:23,520
Well that's not a bad idea either, honestly. It's time for that to happen too. So we can

165
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:27,640
lose the controllers right along with the remotes, honestly. It's time for that to start

166
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:34,120
happening. What's also interesting is the game Jam with the Band. There's this game

167
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:37,240
they have in Japan. They don't have it here yet. I don't remember if they have plans to

168
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:40,720
bring this over here yet or not but you can actually download additional music

169
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:47,000
for this game via the kiosks so and it saves to your DS somehow and I never

170
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:50,280
knew the DS had a type of drive in it but it must have some type of memory

171
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:54,320
flash or something because the information will actually save but I

172
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:58,520
guess if you think about it Loki aren't the games just on flashcards anyway so

173
00:11:58,520 --> 00:12:02,460
maybe when you're downloading the information it's going right onto the

174
00:12:02,460 --> 00:12:06,740
game. I have no idea how that works. Enlighten me, Tecmasa.

175
00:12:06,740 --> 00:12:10,100
I have no idea. I'm sorry, I'm being distracted by Tekken 5 here. Okay, we're gonna turn that

176
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:15,500
off. That's alright. Alright. Well then I suppose we will get into Tekken 5 news. Let's

177
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:21,540
talk about Tekken 5. Tekken 5 is out? It really just kinda came out in the middle of nowhere.

178
00:12:21,540 --> 00:12:27,260
Like I remember mentioning it. It came out Friday. But really, it was like, dang, all

179
00:12:27,260 --> 00:12:34,420
sudden Tekken 5 is out. And here's the crazy thing about Tekken 5. It's got Tekken 1, 2,

180
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:43,400
and 3 all in it. And, and, and, and Star Blade. That's so cool. You know how I think it was

181
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:50,920
Tekken, the first Tekken or Tekken 2 had like a Galaga. Yeah. For the loading game. That's

182
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:51,920
That's right.

183
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:53,560
And has freakin' Starblade as the loading game.

184
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:55,800
Talk about a step up there.

185
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:57,640
That's pretty cool.

186
00:12:57,640 --> 00:12:58,960
Ridge Racer had Galaga.

187
00:12:58,960 --> 00:12:59,960
Huh.

188
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:03,680
But a lot of the Namco games had loading games.

189
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:04,680
Interesting.

190
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:07,200
Now have you gotten a chance to play match of Tekken 5 at all yet?

191
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:09,960
I unwrapped it before we walked out of the door, literally.

192
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:10,960
Gotcha.

193
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:11,960
So you haven't really had a chance to tell.

194
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:12,960
But you played the arcade version.

195
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:13,960
Yeah.

196
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:14,960
I played it in Alabama.

197
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:20,960
Cause it, you know, I went right to, the only arcades in my hometown are Namco arcades.

198
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:24,960
Unless you count, um, Ground Zero and that's just privately owned.

199
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:31,960
But, um, first thing I did was make a beeline to Tekken 5 cause Tekken 5 had just recently come out in California

200
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:34,960
but it had been out, um, at all the Namco arcades ages ago.

201
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:38,960
So no one was there, I got to play it as much as I wanted to.

202
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:40,960
Very cool.

203
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:47,960
Um, okay, so, I'm looking forward to playing this game. I'll give you a full review on Tekken 5 as soon as I can.

204
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:48,460
Next week.

205
00:13:48,460 --> 00:13:52,960
Next week! Yes, Loki and I will both- we will duel to the death on Tekken 5.

206
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:54,460
I suck at Tekken, so that'll be great.

207
00:13:54,460 --> 00:13:55,960
I'll get to own you both.

208
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:59,460
I'm not that great at Tekken. Jaime will kick both our asses, honestly.

209
00:13:59,460 --> 00:14:02,960
I like Hoa Rong, because he has this really cheap move I always do with him.

210
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:03,960
Is he in Tekken 5?

211
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:04,460
Yes.

212
00:14:04,460 --> 00:14:05,960
Oh, he better be. Good! Yay! I'm saved.

213
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:07,960
And of course, my man Jean is in there.

214
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:12,440
You can tell I'm such a Tekken 5 noob and I have not touched the arcade version yet,

215
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:15,200
but seriously, every time I want to go play in the arcade, huge line, huge!

216
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:19,560
I have my card, I haven't been able to use it since I came back in the state.

217
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:23,800
Now that, now, it kind of doesn't seem like there was much time between the arcade release

218
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:26,480
and the home release, but I guess what you're saying about the Namco.

219
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:30,640
I remember the little movie at E3 and then, bam, arcade, whoa.

220
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:33,320
Bam, arcade, and then bam, home version, it's like, yeesh.

221
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:38,840
Alright, let's go ahead and move on to

222
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:42,120
one other quick story. Very interesting announcement. We've had

223
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:45,700
something Nintendo and something Sony with tech and now let's get to something

224
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:50,000
Xbox. Microsoft. Hironobu Sakaguchi

225
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:54,440
has joined up with Microsoft to develop role-playing game video games

226
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:56,120
exclusively for

227
00:14:56,120 --> 00:15:00,440
the upcoming next-gen Xbox system. Why is this such a big deal?

228
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:07,320
Well, if you didn't recognize the name, Sakaguchi is the creator of the Final Fantasy franchise.

229
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:08,320
Very interesting.

230
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:09,320
Good for them.

231
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:13,800
I'd like to see them expand on games like Fable.

232
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:19,520
The Xbox needs some, like, different variety kinds of games, I think.

233
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:23,640
I think Fable was a good place for the Xbox to go, despite how you might feel about that

234
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:24,640
game.

235
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:26,920
It was kind of like, what is the Xbox really freaking lacking?

236
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:28,200
Oh, a good RPG.

237
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:32,580
well finally you get fable way later so I think this is a good direction for

238
00:15:32,580 --> 00:15:36,720
Microsoft to be looking into so just my thought I don't know any other thoughts

239
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:41,420
from you guys I could definitely hopefully they're gonna be making some

240
00:15:41,420 --> 00:15:45,940
good games maybe an online game I would hope for an online game I don't know

241
00:15:45,940 --> 00:15:50,400
about MMO because I'm kind of headed up to here with MMOs but I don't know I

242
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:55,820
guess that's where the money's at right I'll wait and see wait and see all right

243
00:15:55,820 --> 00:15:59,660
Alright, now of course we here at Orange Lounge Radio, we're not just here to fill you in

244
00:15:59,660 --> 00:16:04,820
on all the video game news that doesn't suck, but we're here to better your lives as well.

245
00:16:04,820 --> 00:16:09,140
But what better way to do that than allow Jamie to give you her advice column.

246
00:16:09,140 --> 00:16:15,020
So Dark Sakura, turn that anger that you usually have on our three hour program at OrangeLoungeRadio.com

247
00:16:15,020 --> 00:16:18,540
and turn it into a little bit of love for our listeners.

248
00:16:18,540 --> 00:16:26,500
I swear you people I give you good advice you never follow it so here's

249
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:31,300
some advice did someone fail a lie detector test last week I guess so all

250
00:16:31,300 --> 00:16:37,340
right we have a bunch of liars yes and his name is mr. Jackson today's advice

251
00:16:37,340 --> 00:16:42,180
is how to get to the surface if your scuba tank runs out of air number one

252
00:16:42,180 --> 00:16:45,580
signal to your fellow divers that you are having a problem point to your tank

253
00:16:45,580 --> 00:16:56,020
or regulator. 2. If someone comes to your age, share his or her regulator, passing it

254
00:16:56,020 --> 00:17:00,700
back and forth while swimming slowly to the surface. 3. If no one can help you, keep your

255
00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:05,140
regulator in your mouth as air may expand in the tank as you ascend. Look straight up

256
00:17:05,140 --> 00:17:13,660
so that your airway is as straight as possible. 4. Swim to the surface at a moderate rate.

257
00:17:13,660 --> 00:17:17,660
Exhale continuously as you swim up but do not exhaust all of your air in the first few

258
00:17:17,660 --> 00:17:19,360
seconds of your ascent.

259
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:25,180
If you do not exhale continuously, you risk an aneurysm.

260
00:17:25,180 --> 00:17:33,780
And another bit of the thing to add to that, just don't go scuba diving.

261
00:17:33,780 --> 00:17:40,220
If people were meant to swim that deep, they'd have gills, like in Waterworld.

262
00:17:40,220 --> 00:17:44,780
if you go scuba diving go down like maybe 20 feet at the most you snorkel

263
00:17:44,780 --> 00:17:50,140
did you actually see the water world movie okay I know they had gills I know

264
00:17:50,140 --> 00:17:55,220
it sucked well I don't Costner of course I know I just made a comment about not

265
00:17:55,220 --> 00:17:59,100
wanting to talk about MMOs but I had to mention this one

266
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:05,740
anarchy anarchy anarchy online players will soon be seeing advertisements on

267
00:18:05,740 --> 00:18:10,660
on billboards that are stationed in central regions of the game's landscape

268
00:18:10,660 --> 00:18:14,340
uh... they're teaming up with the new york city based massive

269
00:18:14,340 --> 00:18:17,840
uh... the folks that create anarchy online and uh... they're going to be

270
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:20,100
putting ads inside the game

271
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:23,060
what do you think about ads in m m o s

272
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:25,500
i hear though the game's gonna go free

273
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:29,100
i think i guess now that would make sense why there's ads in it i suppose but

274
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:30,680
seriously funding

275
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:34,280
after the news that we got about the slash pizza in a request to last week

276
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:35,460
with the pizza hut

277
00:18:35,460 --> 00:18:38,960
I mean, this is a totally obvious-

278
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:42,960
To be honest, I mean, in a game like that, I don't really- I haven't ever played Anarchy

279
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:47,720
Online, but if it's on billboards or something, I really don't see that deterring away from

280
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:49,420
the game really that much.

281
00:18:49,420 --> 00:18:50,420
I mean...

282
00:18:50,420 --> 00:18:53,400
If it were in Final Fantasy XI, though, that would totally detract.

283
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:54,400
Yeah, that would make no sense.

284
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:58,360
Oh, I can't wait for the day- I can't wait for the day when I go into one of my Burning

285
00:18:58,360 --> 00:19:05,440
Circle Notorious Monster battles and it's like, Pepsi presents the Burning Circle Battle!

286
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:08,620
Britney Spears coming out singing a song, and then you get to attack the monster, who

287
00:19:08,620 --> 00:19:09,620
is Britney Spears actually?

288
00:19:09,620 --> 00:19:13,220
You know, like, I can understand something like that, say, in Matrix online, where you're

289
00:19:13,220 --> 00:19:15,100
going to have billboards and ads.

290
00:19:15,100 --> 00:19:16,100
Right.

291
00:19:16,100 --> 00:19:18,320
In that type of environment, something like that would make sense.

292
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:20,740
That would actually be a good way to-

293
00:19:20,740 --> 00:19:23,100
Powerade.

294
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:25,180
Just like in the game, you know?

295
00:19:25,180 --> 00:19:30,220
But that would actually be a good way to get a little bit of extra money in there.

296
00:19:30,220 --> 00:19:35,180
But like, in something that's, you know, like, I wouldn't see it in Ragnarok online.

297
00:19:35,180 --> 00:19:39,380
No, to be honest if they're gonna put ads in a game and then they're gonna like say

298
00:19:39,380 --> 00:19:43,140
I don't know make it free or reduce the fees. It's gonna cost her a month

299
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:46,300
Of course, you're gonna get people everybody. I'm fucked that I don't care, you know

300
00:19:46,300 --> 00:19:51,860
Hey, as long as I mean really long as it's not pop-ups cuz I fucking hate pop-ups

301
00:19:51,860 --> 00:19:53,860
Well, that's gonna turn from the game

302
00:19:53,900 --> 00:19:56,540
It's all about you know gameplay and these good things

303
00:19:56,540 --> 00:20:01,220
You know, otherwise you're gonna get people not gonna you know, shell out the 20 bucks or whatever

304
00:20:01,220 --> 00:20:03,220
It is a month to play these things. So

305
00:20:03,220 --> 00:20:14,220
So, you know, why not? I don't see a problem with it, and Anarchy Online seems like to me it's a pretty dynamic game as it is, pretty futuristic and stuff.

306
00:20:14,220 --> 00:20:22,220
So I guess it could fit in a few billboards, who cares? Whether it be some generic thing that doesn't exist or an actual product, who cares?

307
00:20:22,220 --> 00:20:30,220
I mean, it doesn't detract from the game that much, and even if they have like, you know, what is it, maybe even vending machines or something that we're like strewn about,

308
00:20:30,220 --> 00:20:34,180
You know or other crap, you know product placement and stuff. It really doesn't matter

309
00:20:34,180 --> 00:20:37,360
How about like in Duke Nukem 3d where I could blow those vending machines up?

310
00:20:37,900 --> 00:20:43,020
That would be awesome actually, but I'm just saying it's I don't like this ad. It's not a big deal

311
00:20:43,020 --> 00:20:45,700
I think would know these ads being in there

312
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:48,580
It's when they go a little bit beyond that when you know

313
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:53,480
Your loading screens have you know ads in it and like all that stuff that might get annoying

314
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:57,980
But I think just screwing about making it actually fit the environment. I don't think that's a big deal

315
00:20:57,980 --> 00:21:04,540
Well, we shall see how far they take this idea, because anything they can advertise

316
00:21:04,540 --> 00:21:05,540
on they'll do it.

317
00:21:05,540 --> 00:21:10,460
I'm still waiting for my slash pizza and slash porn, but you know, no luck yet.

318
00:21:10,460 --> 00:21:15,380
Alright, back to Nintendo, they're going to be releasing a whole lot of titles in May,

319
00:21:15,380 --> 00:21:20,460
including Pokemon Emerald and Fire Emblem The Sacred Stones.

320
00:21:20,460 --> 00:21:25,500
Also coming out in May, Donkey Konga 2 and Geist.

321
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:31,180
any of those games gonna be on the DS actually no they are all being released

322
00:21:31,180 --> 00:21:36,740
for the not not Pokemon it I'm sorry Pokemon emerald and fire emblem of

323
00:21:36,740 --> 00:21:40,920
course our Gameboy advanced titles Donkey Kong 2 and Geist GameCube titles

324
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:49,060
no do you know DS titles Wow only one in February gee I don't think the PSP is

325
00:21:49,060 --> 00:21:53,360
gonna blow them out of the water when it gets released you mean the great game

326
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:58,300
shooter yes the great game shooter Pokemon emerald of course being the

327
00:21:58,300 --> 00:22:01,880
next saga in the put it's it's another Pokemon game what else do I need to say

328
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:06,800
it's another freaking Pokemon game you know I remember another console system

329
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:10,340
a while back that actually had pretty good graphics but no games for it I

330
00:22:10,340 --> 00:22:15,080
don't know if anyone remembers the Atari links oh yes we've got links we have a

331
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:18,300
bunch of games for you you have everything just because you own it

332
00:22:18,300 --> 00:22:21,660
doesn't mean it was successful you have everything it was awesome and it had

333
00:22:21,660 --> 00:22:26,900
Great commercial where the kids not got a class to sit in the bathroom to play it and the links had tempest 2000 which was

334
00:22:26,900 --> 00:22:31,900
My point beam though. Is that if they oh, no, never mind. I'm getting the links Jaguar. Hello

335
00:22:31,900 --> 00:22:37,640
I'm getting the links mixed up with the Jaguar. That's my see that's how much I played these systems. What?

336
00:22:39,260 --> 00:22:41,420
If I had a ruler and was a nun

337
00:22:43,420 --> 00:22:49,020
Whatever the point being is is the fact that they have the lack of games is gonna kill that system

338
00:22:49,020 --> 00:22:54,480
And sadly enough if they really need to get on the ball here with you know getting even like third parties

339
00:22:54,480 --> 00:23:01,580
But it can play the advanced games the pac-man marble goodie guess what the gameboy advance can play the gameboy games

340
00:23:01,740 --> 00:23:03,740
But you know what that doesn't matter

341
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:07,080
We need marble madness

342
00:23:07,900 --> 00:23:09,900
damn, sir crystal castles

343
00:23:10,460 --> 00:23:15,700
Using the stylus as a trackball that would be a good idea for like Atari or somebody to put out

344
00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:18,020
I believe they're doing it good smart people

345
00:23:19,340 --> 00:23:21,540
Fire Emblem of course is the long-running

346
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:27,520
Strategy RPG series and it'll have new characters yada yada Donkey Kong is the game with a bongos

347
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:34,020
You know music game lots of fun Geist you will be in the role of a ghost who possesses people

348
00:23:34,860 --> 00:23:40,060
So it's a game about possessing people that sounds kind of cool. No that sounds pretty cool, but it's already been done

349
00:23:40,060 --> 00:23:46,120
I'm wondering why they're just now jumping on fire. Oh, wait a second. There's been like seven other versions out in Japan

350
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:48,700
Cuz it's just now starting to take off here

351
00:23:48,700 --> 00:23:55,320
I was a game out there that I saw at e3 where he possessed stuff including like a dog food bowl now

352
00:23:55,320 --> 00:24:02,800
That might have been guys though. Yeah, that probably was guys. Never mind. I sound like an idiot. It's all right. Nothing. Nothing abnormal

353
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:06,620
Lastly

354
00:24:06,620 --> 00:24:14,580
Little piece of news here the fable soundtrack is coming out or it just came out recently and it has the fable theme

355
00:24:14,580 --> 00:24:17,740
Which was created by Danny Elfman, of course, you know, we can go boy go

356
00:24:18,420 --> 00:24:21,780
And it's being released by something else

357
00:24:22,420 --> 00:24:28,780
Sum something else studios and it has a lot of the score as well by Russell Shaw, which kind of makes me think

358
00:24:29,620 --> 00:24:35,000
Why the hell don't more video games get soundtrack releases seriously do in Japan just about every game that comes out

359
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:38,600
Well, sure, in Japan, but I'm talking about America, so I don't have to pay-

360
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:40,400
What's happening more often?

361
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:45,320
But for games like Fable, what about games like DDR getting full soundtracks?

362
00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:49,480
I guess they have the VRares, I guess, but there's other games with great soundtracks

363
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:50,480
as well.

364
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:51,920
Katamari Damacy, hello.

365
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:54,200
Yeah, that had great music.

366
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:56,200
Where's the domestic soundtrack release?

367
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:58,640
Although, um, I know that, um...

368
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:03,240
Of course, the soundtrack will probably cost as much as the game, but hey.

369
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:05,160
Well

370
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:07,160
there are games that

371
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:10,520
they put soundtracks out for like I

372
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:16,200
Have to think about it actually or dad. You know what they could do they did well for all of the

373
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:23,320
Grand Theft Auto games yeah, you know they could do though. Why don't they just near release Katamari Damacy

374
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:29,240
Special Edition including the soundtrack in a poster sell it for 30 bucks there you go

375
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:31,640
Guess what you made your money, and you sold the game again. That's so

376
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:33,960
Like in Korea and include a umbrella.

377
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:37,640
Because guess, because you know what people out there are buying special editions.

378
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:40,480
That's a brand new thing now that they're doing with all these games that are coming out.

379
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:42,360
Tekken 5 special edition, 100 bucks.

380
00:25:42,360 --> 00:25:47,880
Exactly, and it's just, that's the thing, that's, you know, if you want your soundtrack, put it in the special edition.

381
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:49,400
That's the way to do it.

382
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:53,880
Alright, that's gonna wrap it up for tonight's podcast.

383
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:58,480
Thank you guys very much for downloading us and staying loyal to our show. We appreciate it.

384
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:00,480
Jamie, any parting words for our listeners tonight?

385
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:02,480
L.

386
00:26:02,980 --> 00:26:03,980
Loki.

387
00:26:03,980 --> 00:26:10,980
Ultracade trying to copyright MAME is bad.

388
00:26:10,980 --> 00:26:14,980
Do not play Ultracade and fight this to the death.

389
00:26:14,980 --> 00:26:19,980
Not only is it bad, but it's stupid and they have no legal grounds.

390
00:26:19,980 --> 00:26:24,980
It's so bad it should have its own word. It's like bad wrong or badong.

391
00:26:24,980 --> 00:26:29,820
Sorry, that's a Kung Pao reference there.

392
00:26:29,820 --> 00:26:34,660
And my final thought I guess would be, thou shalt kick an Ultracade machine when you see

393
00:26:34,660 --> 00:26:36,380
it.

394
00:26:36,380 --> 00:26:51,620
Have a great one everybody, we'll see you next time.
