01:31.109 --> 01:34.212
[SPEAKER_16]: I'll listen to the sound of the wind, and I'll stack up my mirrors.

01:34.352 --> 01:37.394
[SPEAKER_16]: I want to get the same feeling, a life that's irreplaceable.

01:37.534 --> 01:40.056

[SPEAKER_20]: There's a

06:32.674 --> 06:35.657

07:08.492 --> 07:13.433
[SPEAKER_20]: Although, I don't know, we might want to turn it on later to show... Yeah, we're probably going to turn it on a little later, it's just not on right now.

[SPEAKER_27]: This is radio station CJ Boogie with a brand new world premiere song for Captain Jack, Only You.

14:11.705 --> 14:17.567
[SPEAKER_09]: Please listen to Orange Lounge Radio, because real radio makes Captain Jack cry.

14:22.308 --> 14:27.270
[SPEAKER_20]: Hello boys and girls, and welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 131.

14:28.210 --> 14:31.791
[SPEAKER_20]: In progress, we're here on this Valentine's Day eve.

14:33.035 --> 14:37.599
[SPEAKER_20]: Happy Valentine's Day to all you lovebirds out there, all you happy, sweet little couples.

14:38.600 --> 14:41.922
[SPEAKER_20]: And to the rest of you, happy Bitter Singles Awareness Day.

14:42.202 --> 14:45.905
[SPEAKER_20]: Yes, you're in the same boat that I am, so the next break of songs will be for you.

14:47.066 --> 14:50.930
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm going to pick some good bitter, angry songs for the next break.

14:51.130 --> 14:52.511
[SPEAKER_20]: I don't know if there's really a whole lot of

14:53.208 --> 14:53.428
[SPEAKER_20]: Jamey

15:14.033 --> 15:15.954
[SPEAKER_20]: AKA DarkSakura is not here tonight.

15:16.534 --> 15:20.016
[SPEAKER_20]: She is spending Valentine's Day Eve with her man.

15:20.496 --> 15:25.158
[SPEAKER_20]: Because, you know, she's engaged and, you know, has her hetero life partner or whatever.

15:25.799 --> 15:27.299
[SPEAKER_20]: I can't remember how she refers to them.

15:27.340 --> 15:29.741
[SPEAKER_20]: But, you know, they're out and doing their thing.

15:30.541 --> 15:34.123
[SPEAKER_20]: I guess because tomorrow being a work day, it's a little harder to do stuff.

15:34.163 --> 15:37.905
[SPEAKER_20]: So they're doing their lovey-dovey stuff tonight.

15:39.525 --> 15:40.886
[SPEAKER_20]: I suppose we can forgive it.

15:41.426 --> 15:42.687
[SPEAKER_20]: As long as it's only once a year.

15:43.493 --> 15:46.456
[SPEAKER_20]: The minute they try to bring Valentine's Day into another holiday, forget it.

15:46.536 --> 15:47.016
[SPEAKER_20]: It's done with.

15:51.120 --> 15:53.563
[SPEAKER_20]: Wait a minute, wait, wait.

15:53.963 --> 15:55.424
[SPEAKER_20]: Loki's saying something about, I'll allow it.

15:56.405 --> 15:59.008
[SPEAKER_20]: Loki, I thought Valentine's Day was a pain in the ass for you.

15:59.028 --> 16:05.734
[SPEAKER_19]: I said, I'll allow it, as Judge Mills Lane would say.

16:07.035 --> 16:07.336
[SPEAKER_20]: Alright.

16:09.864 --> 16:13.487
[SPEAKER_20]: We'll start off the show as we usually do, playing a little bit of How Was Your Week, How Was Your Day?

16:14.067 --> 16:19.311
[SPEAKER_20]: And I guess we all know that DarkSakura is the one that usually starts us off, and we all know that she's doing great tonight, I'm sure.

16:19.892 --> 16:22.734
[SPEAKER_20]: So, you know, well, I guess we'll go to DDR Angel.

16:22.814 --> 16:24.135
[SPEAKER_20]: DDR Angel, how was your week, how was your day?

16:24.956 --> 16:27.538
[SPEAKER_30]: Actually, it was kind of depressing for once.

16:28.218 --> 16:28.939
[SPEAKER_30]: Me, depressed?

16:29.019 --> 16:29.739
[SPEAKER_30]: Yeah, right.

16:29.879 --> 16:31.400
[SPEAKER_30]: Okay.

16:32.221 --> 16:34.923
[SPEAKER_30]: First of all, like, Tuesday when I went to school, everything was fine.

16:36.024 --> 16:38.506
[SPEAKER_30]: Until, like, just before my second class.

16:39.011 --> 16:42.512
[SPEAKER_30]: When I realized my Linux book was missing.

16:43.492 --> 16:46.773
[SPEAKER_30]: And so I was in a slight panic, emailed the teacher, all that stuff.

16:47.953 --> 16:48.973
[SPEAKER_30]: Wondering where the hell it went.

16:49.293 --> 16:55.535
[SPEAKER_30]: And also, in the next 48 hours, I was preparing myself to actually have to go out and buy the book again.

16:56.255 --> 17:04.797
[SPEAKER_30]: But I went to class Thursday, and it turns out that the student that sits next to me decided to grab it on accident.

17:04.837 --> 17:06.477
[SPEAKER_30]: So she ran up to me on...

17:07.267 --> 17:36.117
[SPEAKER_30]: Thursday and gave it back and you know was really apologetic and stuff and so it was just a turn around from a bad situation to a good one again so that turned out really well and the next depressing thing that happened to me is unfortunately permanent so that kind of sucks the radio station I was DJing for KTHR also known as Pulse before it was KTHR um

17:36.980 --> 17:46.743
[SPEAKER_30]: They ended up shutting down this week, so after three years of my life, I'm no longer DJing for a station that I actually like DJing for, so that kind of sucks.

17:46.763 --> 17:51.745
[SPEAKER_20]: You know what, and all that news about what they're doing, I think it's time for us to quit too.

17:52.586 --> 18:03.189
[SPEAKER_30]: Well, it was sad for me because, honestly, if it wasn't for Orange Lounge, I wouldn't have found them or anything like that, and that was two and a half years ago.

18:06.056 --> 18:14.442
[SPEAKER_30]: Something like that, when you went to your buddy's show and boom, next thing you know I'm DJing for them.

18:14.602 --> 18:17.004
[SPEAKER_20]: Oh, that's right.

18:17.064 --> 18:21.447
[SPEAKER_20]: You didn't find out about them until I went and did the guest thing on their network.

18:21.827 --> 18:22.607
[SPEAKER_13]: Yep, that's right.

18:22.808 --> 18:25.790
[SPEAKER_20]: And you know, that DJ, she's back in town this weekend, so it's kind of neat.

18:27.030 --> 18:28.852
[SPEAKER_20]: I don't think she's listening, though.

18:28.972 --> 18:30.253
[SPEAKER_20]: No, she's out.

18:30.353 --> 18:32.214
[SPEAKER_20]: She's either working or she's partying.

18:32.674 --> 18:34.215
[SPEAKER_20]: There's not a whole lot else to do in town with you.

18:34.235 --> 18:35.016
[SPEAKER_20]: Probably partying, you know.

18:36.118 --> 18:36.418
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh yeah.

18:36.778 --> 19:04.555
[SPEAKER_30]: So, you know, I either have a choice of going to a newer radio station or just kind of hanging low and whatever and, you know, if it wasn't, I realize that Orange Lodge was obviously my first radio station I was associated with, so you guys are always going to be first, but as far as, you know, side work was concerned, the other radio station was just what I did and for half the week I was just really down and

19:05.345 --> 19:08.689
[SPEAKER_30]: I still am a little bit, but I'm getting over it a little bit, you know, slowly.

19:09.469 --> 19:17.658
[SPEAKER_20]: Well, you know, and as I said, because you'd mentioned this, and LJ, LiveJournal, for those who don't know, LJ is a place where we can all get a little emo when we need to be.

19:18.019 --> 19:18.759
[SPEAKER_29]: Yeah, really.

19:19.280 --> 19:21.462
[SPEAKER_20]: You made a little bit of an emo post earlier this week.

19:21.883 --> 19:22.263
[SPEAKER_29]: I did.

19:22.283 --> 19:22.904
[SPEAKER_29]: Because you were sad.

19:22.944 --> 19:24.806
[SPEAKER_29]: You were like, I'm so depressed.

19:25.627 --> 19:26.788
[SPEAKER_29]: I really was, though.

19:27.188 --> 19:46.426
[SPEAKER_20]: But, I mean, you know, as I mentioned in LiveJournal, I'll tell you again, for the benefit of our listeners, you know, when a radio station like that closes down, you just have to remember the good memories you have of the people you met there, and, you know, you'll know those people for some time, and some of them will go off and do other projects, and, you know, maybe you can help them out with that, but you'll remember the radio station for a long time.

19:46.747 --> 19:47.607
[SPEAKER_20]: You know, it's inevitable.

19:47.728 --> 19:50.230
[SPEAKER_20]: Orange Lounge Radio will not last forever, you know.

19:50.660 --> 19:52.721
[SPEAKER_20]: The three of us have to die someday.

19:54.402 --> 20:00.585
[SPEAKER_19]: So... I don't plan on dying ever, so... I can't help it.

20:00.645 --> 20:03.547
[SPEAKER_20]: Oh, you clicked on... Oh, you know the secret to immortality then.

20:03.827 --> 20:05.028
[SPEAKER_20]: From that banner on the internet.

20:05.068 --> 20:06.849
[SPEAKER_20]: The secret of... Forget it.

20:07.089 --> 20:07.949
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, go fake.

20:08.369 --> 20:13.352
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, they sent out one spam mail seeing who had actually, you know, hit on that.

20:13.612 --> 20:15.433
[SPEAKER_19]: And actually one of them was real.

20:18.455 --> 20:18.815
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh, I see.

20:18.855 --> 20:19.055
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay.

20:19.075 --> 20:19.155
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay.

20:19.542 --> 20:20.203
[SPEAKER_19]: And you know what?

20:20.663 --> 20:23.606
[SPEAKER_19]: Not only will I live forever, but my penis is larger than ever.

20:27.449 --> 20:30.291
[SPEAKER_19]: And you're getting V1 Agra really cheap?

20:31.012 --> 20:31.432
[SPEAKER_20]: Exactly.

20:31.472 --> 20:32.233
[SPEAKER_31]: V1 Agra?

20:32.493 --> 20:34.235
[SPEAKER_20]: And my breasts, they're firm and large.

20:36.597 --> 20:43.623
[SPEAKER_20]: Anyway, it's inevitable that Orange Lounge Radio is going to die someday, so I hope you all don't.

20:44.264 --> 20:45.365
[SPEAKER_20]: Get too teary-eyed when it happens.

20:45.405 --> 20:48.967
[SPEAKER_20]: Someday, but I hope not soon, just because... It's not going to happen soon.

20:49.367 --> 20:50.428
[SPEAKER_30]: I don't think so.

20:50.708 --> 21:01.736
[SPEAKER_20]: Unless we get the offer to take this to a real thing, like satellite radio, or go to some television outlet.

21:05.138 --> 21:10.822
[SPEAKER_20]: As I've said this time and time again, I would sell out in .5 seconds to the highest bidder.

21:12.307 --> 21:14.748
[SPEAKER_20]: My soul is up for... I'm putting my soul up on eBay.

21:16.549 --> 21:16.789
[SPEAKER_20]: Anyway.

21:17.890 --> 21:19.471
[SPEAKER_20]: I'd be like, you're going to pay me to do this?

21:19.871 --> 21:20.191
[SPEAKER_20]: Okay.

21:21.512 --> 21:23.373
[SPEAKER_20]: Do you want to pay me for doing Wayne's World?

21:23.553 --> 21:23.953
[SPEAKER_20]: Sure.

21:25.774 --> 21:27.955
[SPEAKER_30]: How did I know you were going to go there?

21:28.836 --> 21:30.156
[SPEAKER_20]: That movie is like my anthem.

21:30.617 --> 21:32.257
[SPEAKER_20]: It's like... Anyway, sorry.

21:32.478 --> 21:33.018
[SPEAKER_20]: I'll shut up now.

21:33.358 --> 21:33.558
[SPEAKER_20]: Angel.

21:34.238 --> 21:37.060
[SPEAKER_30]: Um... Jeez, what else did I get into this week?

21:38.181 --> 21:38.921
[SPEAKER_30]: Uh...

21:40.296 --> 21:41.837
[SPEAKER_30]: Some online game that I can't talk about.

21:42.857 --> 21:43.797
[SPEAKER_30]: Loki knows what I'm talking about.

21:43.957 --> 21:44.217
[SPEAKER_30]: Anyway.

21:45.598 --> 21:47.699
[SPEAKER_30]: Yeah, so that was pretty fun.

21:49.259 --> 21:52.720
[SPEAKER_30]: God, I haven't even been able to play Final Fantasy XI this week.

21:53.260 --> 21:55.061
[SPEAKER_30]: Just because of all the crap that's been going on.

21:58.062 --> 21:58.842
[SPEAKER_30]: I guess that's it.

21:58.862 --> 22:01.723
[SPEAKER_30]: I can't really remember much else.

22:01.943 --> 22:02.844
[SPEAKER_30]: Great.

22:03.204 --> 22:03.544
[SPEAKER_30]: What?

22:04.004 --> 22:06.585
[SPEAKER_20]: I just had to point out, they're making bids in the chat room right now.

22:10.567 --> 22:11.168
[SPEAKER_20]: No comment.

22:11.248 --> 22:13.129
[SPEAKER_20]: I need to learn to keep my mouth shut on this show.

22:13.390 --> 22:19.095
[SPEAKER_20]: I know it would make for interesting radio if I didn't say anything, but every time I open my mouth, I get myself in trouble with the chat room.

22:19.135 --> 22:22.017
[SPEAKER_19]: All I got to do is pay more than I'm making out of my job, which isn't that much.

22:22.037 --> 22:22.638
[SPEAKER_19]: Which isn't much.

22:22.758 --> 22:23.919
[SPEAKER_20]: Some of these bids are making.

22:24.179 --> 22:25.340
[SPEAKER_20]: Some of these bids are making.

22:27.942 --> 22:29.524
[SPEAKER_19]: So far, all but, like, one.

22:29.544 --> 22:33.667
[SPEAKER_17]: Anyway, sorry, Angel.

22:33.687 --> 22:34.328
[SPEAKER_17]: We keep cutting you off.

22:34.548 --> 22:35.069
[SPEAKER_30]: No, it's okay.

22:35.369 --> 22:36.009
[SPEAKER_30]: I would go for the...

22:37.466 --> 22:38.187
[SPEAKER_30]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

23:03.331 --> 23:10.976
[SPEAKER_20]: Well, kind of, except you don't have, like, the... There's no prostitutes and gamblers and all that stuff that basically... Because you heard this is what happened to Sims Online.

23:11.016 --> 23:17.840
[SPEAKER_20]: Sims Online was supposed to be this, you know, great new online experience game, and it quickly turned into every Vegas street corner.

23:18.280 --> 23:19.301
[SPEAKER_19]: That's fucking awesome.

23:20.181 --> 23:24.224
[SPEAKER_19]: I would play Sims Online if it didn't cost money, just for that.

23:24.984 --> 23:31.128
[SPEAKER_30]: Well, theirs is actually kind of worse, because you end up using your own money to get, you know, game money...

23:31.713 --> 23:32.513
[SPEAKER_30]: and all that stuff.

23:32.853 --> 23:35.094
[SPEAKER_30]: So you kind of have to watch yourself, otherwise you'll go broke.

23:35.714 --> 23:37.355
[SPEAKER_20]: That's the other interesting thing about there.

23:37.455 --> 23:43.496
[SPEAKER_20]: They have made buying the in-game currency with real money, like, not a problem.

23:44.256 --> 23:45.957
[SPEAKER_30]: Seriously, because you'll... That's the way it should be.

23:45.997 --> 23:59.541
[SPEAKER_20]: Whereas every other online role-playing game, you know, Final Fantasy, EverQuest, World of Warcraft, you know, they frown on people selling the gold or the gil or the whatevers outside of the game for real money.

23:59.821 --> 24:00.461
[SPEAKER_20]: But there...

24:01.829 --> 24:03.709
[SPEAKER_19]: I haven't learned jack shit from farming.

24:04.069 --> 24:07.170
[SPEAKER_19]: All I learned is that I might die if I'm not paying attention.

24:09.970 --> 24:14.171
[SPEAKER_30]: Yeah, so, I mean, there's kind of different like that.

24:15.591 --> 24:18.292
[SPEAKER_30]: I ended up getting there married, quote, end quote.

24:20.032 --> 24:20.272
[SPEAKER_20]: Aww.

24:20.292 --> 24:20.652
[SPEAKER_30]: Shut up.

24:22.433 --> 24:23.313
[SPEAKER_30]: It was cute, whatever.

24:23.433 --> 24:24.893
[SPEAKER_20]: So you had an online wedding?

24:25.973 --> 24:26.093
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah.

24:26.753 --> 24:27.493
[SPEAKER_20]: Only in America.

24:28.014 --> 24:30.554
[SPEAKER_19]: I want a there honeymoon.

24:33.228 --> 24:34.849
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah, what did you do for the there honeymoon?

24:35.710 --> 24:36.871
[SPEAKER_30]: Um, nothing yet.

24:36.911 --> 24:37.651
[SPEAKER_30]: He said he's going to do it.

24:38.152 --> 24:39.633
[SPEAKER_30]: He said he'll probably do it tonight or whatever.

24:39.653 --> 24:40.954
[SPEAKER_22]: He's going to do it tonight.

24:40.974 --> 24:42.014
[SPEAKER_22]: He's going to do it tonight.

24:42.034 --> 24:43.335
[SPEAKER_30]: Shut the hell up.

24:44.136 --> 24:46.558
[SPEAKER_30]: Hey, it was kind of cool, but he shot me off a cliff.

24:47.518 --> 24:48.279
[SPEAKER_30]: Yeah, shut up.

24:48.739 --> 24:49.740
[SPEAKER_30]: I knew that was going to go there.

24:49.760 --> 24:52.042
[SPEAKER_20]: Can you buy some there condoms with real life money?

24:53.683 --> 24:54.824
[SPEAKER_30]: See, now I got them started.

24:54.864 --> 24:56.265
[SPEAKER_30]: What the hell was I thinking?

24:56.285 --> 24:57.846
[SPEAKER_19]: You better get there morning after pill.

24:58.559 --> 25:01.121
[SPEAKER_19]: Otherwise you're going to have their illegitimate child.

25:01.382 --> 25:03.243
[SPEAKER_30]: Okay, this is just as bad as a piss joke.

25:03.283 --> 25:04.504
[SPEAKER_19]: Who's their baby daddy?

25:06.786 --> 25:07.306
[SPEAKER_30]: Hey now.

25:07.787 --> 25:08.087
[SPEAKER_22]: Sorry.

25:08.187 --> 25:09.528
[SPEAKER_30]: Anyway, he shot me off a cliff.

25:09.588 --> 25:10.269
[SPEAKER_30]: That was kind of funny.

25:10.869 --> 25:11.510
[SPEAKER_30]: Wait, what?

25:12.771 --> 25:17.775
[SPEAKER_30]: We jumped into a buggy, quote unquote, their car, and he hit the boost and I jumped off.

25:18.255 --> 25:19.016
[SPEAKER_30]: We flew off the cliff.

25:19.076 --> 25:19.697
[SPEAKER_30]: It was kind of funny.

25:20.157 --> 25:22.279
[SPEAKER_20]: So you got married and then jumped off a cliff?

25:22.399 --> 25:22.559
[SPEAKER_30]: Yeah.

25:23.630 --> 25:30.471
[SPEAKER_19]: Well, you know, I did watch a story last night about this guy that was trying to get people to commit suicide on Valentine's Day.

25:31.211 --> 25:36.052
[SPEAKER_19]: See, all it takes is one bitter person and they're all dead.

25:40.573 --> 25:41.193
[SPEAKER_19]: Wow.

25:41.773 --> 25:42.433
[SPEAKER_20]: They're dead.

25:42.453 --> 25:48.815
[SPEAKER_30]: If only you guys knew about that game, you probably wouldn't be picking on me so much, but hey, it's always fun.

25:49.515 --> 25:50.855
[SPEAKER_20]: It sounds like fun, it's just I...

25:51.266 --> 25:51.526
[SPEAKER_20]: Firebomber

26:20.049 --> 26:21.630
[SPEAKER_20]: I don't know if it's Boma or Bama.

26:22.050 --> 26:22.650
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm going to say Bama.

26:22.670 --> 26:23.971
[SPEAKER_20]: I like that because it sounds like fire than bomb.

26:24.251 --> 26:27.532
[SPEAKER_20]: FireBama says their STDs suck, so be careful.

26:28.953 --> 26:29.853
[SPEAKER_20]: Don't get their herpes.

26:31.354 --> 26:32.514
[SPEAKER_30]: Yeah.

26:33.295 --> 26:33.575
[SPEAKER_30]: No.

26:33.775 --> 26:37.097
[SPEAKER_19]: That would suck if you could catch diseases from online games.

26:37.357 --> 26:37.937
[SPEAKER_30]: Oh, jeez.

26:40.138 --> 26:42.979
[SPEAKER_20]: I think online games are kind of a disease in general.

26:43.039 --> 26:43.919
[SPEAKER_20]: I mean, seriously.

26:44.400 --> 26:44.920
[SPEAKER_20]: There's got to be...

26:45.430 --> 26:51.232
[SPEAKER_20]: I bet if I went to a shrink and I told them how much I played Final Fantasy XI, she'd fucking slap me upside the head and say, GO OUTSIDE!

26:51.793 --> 26:55.474
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm gonna sue Final Fantasy XI and Square Enix for making me lazy.

26:56.154 --> 27:03.877
[SPEAKER_20]: But they have their disclaimer at the start of the game that says, you know, Don't forget your family and friends and work.

27:04.118 --> 27:07.799
[SPEAKER_19]: No, I didn't forget my family, friends, and work, but I'm sitting on my ass playing the game.

27:08.519 --> 27:12.741
[SPEAKER_19]: I acknowledge that they exist, however, you know.

27:13.920 --> 27:15.261
[SPEAKER_31]: I think about them all the time.

27:15.561 --> 27:17.622
[SPEAKER_31]: And I think about how much they don't love me.

27:18.622 --> 27:20.883
[SPEAKER_29]: Which is why I'm playing this goddamn game.

27:21.863 --> 27:24.565
[SPEAKER_29]: If I get killed by a goblin one more... Okay, I'll shut up.

27:29.046 --> 27:29.607
[SPEAKER_29]: Next!

27:30.187 --> 27:31.047
[SPEAKER_29]: Because I'm done.

27:31.607 --> 27:32.588
[SPEAKER_19]: Loki, how was your week?

27:32.628 --> 27:33.148
[SPEAKER_19]: How was your day?

27:34.949 --> 27:40.071
[SPEAKER_19]: Well... I don't even really remember what happened this week.

27:41.031 --> 27:42.892
[SPEAKER_19]: Not much of anything I'd imagine.

27:43.636 --> 27:57.430
[SPEAKER_19]: Um, let's see, well, today, I spent most of the day playing Final Fantasy, drinking milk and eating bacon bits, and, and, um, then what else did I do?

27:57.450 --> 28:06.739
[SPEAKER_20]: Oh yeah, I started charging my battery, but I found out that, wait, bacon bits, you just eat them right out of the, right out of the can, right?

28:06.759 --> 28:07.160
[SPEAKER_19]: Come here.

28:08.931 --> 28:10.652
[SPEAKER_20]: You just eat the bacon bits right out of the jar.

28:10.672 --> 28:12.232
[SPEAKER_19]: Yep, ate about half the container.

28:12.252 --> 28:13.512
[SPEAKER_20]: Can I put the jar on the webcam?

28:13.872 --> 28:15.893
[SPEAKER_20]: I don't know if the cam's actually up and running just yet.

28:15.953 --> 28:16.493
[SPEAKER_20]: I'll check on that first.

28:16.513 --> 28:19.033
[SPEAKER_19]: It looks up and running, but it might not be up and running on the website.

28:19.053 --> 28:20.734
[SPEAKER_20]: I have to make sure everything's running on the web end.

28:21.154 --> 28:21.574
[SPEAKER_20]: No, it's not.

28:21.854 --> 28:22.514
[SPEAKER_20]: I will set it up.

28:22.554 --> 28:25.695
[SPEAKER_20]: I'll set the webcam up, and I will go show the jar of bacon bits while you talk about your week here.

28:27.255 --> 28:29.075
[SPEAKER_19]: So anyways, yeah, I was eating those.

28:29.215 --> 28:35.337
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't know why, because I had this really crappy soup for lunch, and it just wasn't hitting the spot.

28:35.837 --> 28:37.417
[SPEAKER_19]: So bacon bits, it was, and

28:37.972 --> 29:06.905
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't know, it worked, so whatever, um, so then, also, um, what else happened this week, oh, my co-worker quit finally, and my other co-worker put in his notice, so, I'm all alone, and, um, what else did I do, oh, some other crap I worked on, the thing that pissed me off though is my battery, that cost me $200 is fucked up, and, so now I gotta return it, so, you know, hey,

29:08.988 --> 29:09.408
[SPEAKER_19]: What the hell?

29:11.309 --> 29:16.550
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh yeah, so then as I'm playing Final Fantasy and partying and eating bacon bits, I spill that crap all over the place.

29:17.330 --> 29:23.932
[SPEAKER_20]: So, you know, probably just something stuck in my... For the record, these are imitation bacon buds.

29:25.753 --> 29:27.613
[SPEAKER_19]: Whatever, it's the cheap shit, okay?

29:29.954 --> 29:30.694
[SPEAKER_19]: Don't be hatin'.

29:31.654 --> 29:32.575
[SPEAKER_19]: Nelly likes them too.

29:34.315 --> 29:36.016
[SPEAKER_19]: So anyways, and see you ate him?

29:36.376 --> 29:36.876
[SPEAKER_19]: You ate him too.

29:38.223 --> 29:39.164
[SPEAKER_19]: And I'm grimacing.

29:39.204 --> 29:40.024
[SPEAKER_19]: These are gross.

29:40.084 --> 29:41.185
[SPEAKER_19]: How can you... Ugh!

29:41.865 --> 29:42.526
[SPEAKER_30]: Oh, God!

29:44.407 --> 29:45.487
[SPEAKER_30]: Acquired taste, Robin.

29:45.547 --> 29:50.370
[SPEAKER_19]: And again, I'm also the same person who takes shots of, you know, maple syrup and eats rice.

29:51.191 --> 29:51.551
[SPEAKER_19]: Raw.

29:52.051 --> 29:52.852
[SPEAKER_19]: Without being cooked.

29:54.653 --> 29:57.475
[SPEAKER_20]: Oh, you also eat the top ramen just right out of the bag, uncooked, too.

29:57.515 --> 29:59.216
[SPEAKER_30]: That I can do, unfortunately.

29:59.396 --> 29:59.896
[SPEAKER_20]: Oh, God!

30:00.016 --> 30:00.857
[SPEAKER_20]: What is wrong with you people?

30:01.197 --> 30:01.597
[SPEAKER_30]: What?

30:02.278 --> 30:06.200
[SPEAKER_30]: I can do it, but, you know, I haven't... I haven't eaten it in a...

30:07.862 --> 30:09.163
[SPEAKER_30]: Okay, that I won't do.

30:09.823 --> 30:11.204
[SPEAKER_20]: Now my breast is going to smell like pork.

30:12.365 --> 30:15.888
[SPEAKER_19]: That bacon bit flavor is never going to leave your stomach.

30:16.888 --> 30:17.929
[SPEAKER_19]: That's one of the things about it.

30:18.489 --> 30:24.794
[SPEAKER_20]: Can't you just get some lettuce and some ranch dressing and then have yourself a salad and then put the bacon bits on the salad?

30:25.014 --> 30:26.295
[SPEAKER_19]: I fucking hate salad, dude.

30:26.415 --> 30:27.515
[SPEAKER_19]: Salad is nasty.

30:28.216 --> 30:28.916
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm sorry, man.

30:28.956 --> 30:33.319
[SPEAKER_19]: I cannot imagine eating grass or shrubbery or something like that.

30:33.699 --> 30:34.380
[SPEAKER_19]: That's just nasty.

30:34.440 --> 30:35.140
[SPEAKER_20]: Bunnies do it.

30:35.180 --> 30:35.741
[SPEAKER_20]: Why can't you?

30:37.110 --> 30:38.932
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, but bunnies poop like crazy.

30:40.653 --> 30:42.435
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't fucking take shits like that.

30:46.559 --> 30:46.999
[SPEAKER_20]: I give up.

30:48.881 --> 30:50.022
[SPEAKER_19]: So anyways, um...

30:50.868 --> 30:52.349
[SPEAKER_19]: So yeah, my week was filled with that.

30:52.489 --> 31:01.537
[SPEAKER_19]: And then I got to play... I'm part of the Matrix Online Stress Test 1, which I might say that I'm never going to buy that fucking game because it's lame.

31:02.038 --> 31:03.319
[SPEAKER_19]: It's so awful.

31:03.759 --> 31:07.022
[SPEAKER_20]: I mean, granted, it looks... Don't you have some type of non-disclosure agreement?

31:07.302 --> 31:10.625
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh yeah, I won't tell you why it sucks, but I'm going to tell you that it sucks.

31:11.146 --> 31:13.548
[SPEAKER_19]: No, really, it... I...

31:14.702 --> 31:15.522
[SPEAKER_19]: I like the game.

31:15.542 --> 31:16.543
[SPEAKER_19]: I mean, it's pretty.

31:17.203 --> 31:21.865
[SPEAKER_19]: And the idea, like, they have with, you know, the music where it's dynamic to what you're doing.

31:21.925 --> 31:23.026
[SPEAKER_19]: It changes and that kind of thing.

31:23.066 --> 31:23.706
[SPEAKER_19]: That's cool.

31:24.666 --> 31:26.787
[SPEAKER_19]: But I don't know what the fuck I'm doing at all.

31:26.927 --> 31:31.189
[SPEAKER_19]: I, like, got in there and I'm like, um, yeah.

31:32.010 --> 31:33.330
[SPEAKER_19]: And you just kind of run around.

31:33.370 --> 31:38.332
[SPEAKER_19]: The fighting system's awkward and just... Well, now, wait.

31:38.552 --> 31:39.693
[SPEAKER_20]: I signed no agreements.

31:40.071 --> 31:48.198
[SPEAKER_20]: and I happen to see a friend playing this game so I could express my comments because I'm not holding no agreement.

31:48.538 --> 31:49.018
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't care.

31:49.058 --> 31:51.220
[SPEAKER_19]: They can fucking sue my ass.

31:51.260 --> 31:52.221
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't really give a shit.

31:52.241 --> 31:54.943
[SPEAKER_20]: They ain't gonna get anything.

31:54.983 --> 31:57.145
[SPEAKER_20]: We already talked about how much you make.

31:58.546 --> 32:00.107
[SPEAKER_20]: You certainly don't get paid for this show.

32:00.848 --> 32:01.508
[SPEAKER_19]: Exactly.

32:02.709 --> 32:05.872
[SPEAKER_19]: So, um... Yeah, um...

32:07.423 --> 32:09.104
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, it's not that great.

32:23.175 --> 32:27.698
[SPEAKER_19]: It looks better than I thought it was going to be, and it also, the graphics are pretty good.

32:28.319 --> 32:32.261
[SPEAKER_19]: The amount of, like, ways you can customize your character is pretty cool.

32:33.302 --> 32:38.085
[SPEAKER_19]: But, like, I did about six or seven of the missions, and I was bored out of my mind.

32:38.185 --> 32:39.366
[SPEAKER_19]: I'd only gotten to level two.

32:39.426 --> 32:41.567
[SPEAKER_19]: I had no idea how to level up on anything.

32:41.627 --> 32:42.768
[SPEAKER_20]: Did you get to do any bullet time?

32:43.388 --> 32:43.629
[SPEAKER_20]: No.

32:43.809 --> 32:45.150
[SPEAKER_20]: See, that's what everybody wants.

32:45.190 --> 32:45.990
[SPEAKER_20]: They want bullet time.

32:46.030 --> 32:46.611
[SPEAKER_20]: They want it now.

32:47.371 --> 32:48.652
[SPEAKER_19]: But the thing is, it's like,

32:49.800 --> 32:51.041
[SPEAKER_19]: Well, actually, no, I take that back.

32:51.101 --> 32:53.363
[SPEAKER_19]: There was one move that I did, it's called Cheap Shot.

32:53.863 --> 32:57.085
[SPEAKER_19]: You kind of turn around and in bullet time you kick the guy in the nuts.

32:57.385 --> 32:57.826
[SPEAKER_14]: Cheap Shot 20.

32:58.546 --> 32:59.547
[SPEAKER_19]: So that was kind of cool.

32:59.567 --> 33:00.007
[SPEAKER_14]: Now you got me.

33:00.027 --> 33:05.311
[SPEAKER_19]: But, you know, other than that, it's just like I didn't really know how to, like, progress in the game.

33:05.331 --> 33:08.273
[SPEAKER_19]: Whereas Final Fantasy is pretty simple, you walk outside, kill shit.

33:09.273 --> 33:09.914
[SPEAKER_19]: Exactly.

33:09.934 --> 33:10.674
[SPEAKER_20]: You murder bunnies.

33:10.894 --> 33:15.778
[SPEAKER_19]: Like, I couldn't tell, exactly, I couldn't tell who was the NPCs, who were not the NPCs.

33:16.438 --> 33:17.239
[SPEAKER_19]: Who are the enemies?

33:17.319 --> 33:18.100
[SPEAKER_19]: Who could I fight?

33:18.420 --> 33:19.661
[SPEAKER_19]: What the hell the story was?

33:19.921 --> 33:21.142
[SPEAKER_19]: It's just, it was all confusing.

33:21.402 --> 33:23.544
[SPEAKER_19]: There was a tutorial that I did and I had to quit the game.

33:23.824 --> 33:26.026
[SPEAKER_19]: So then I couldn't go back to the tutorial again.

33:26.586 --> 33:32.111
[SPEAKER_19]: And it's just like, and then Morpheus drones on for about five minutes once you get in the game for the first time.

33:32.611 --> 33:35.614
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm just like, okay, I don't know what the hell's going on.

33:36.314 --> 33:36.935
[SPEAKER_19]: It was confusing.

33:37.455 --> 33:39.317
[SPEAKER_20]: So it was kind of like the second Matrix movie.

33:40.538 --> 33:43.300
[SPEAKER_19]: It's probably better than the second Matrix movie.

33:46.224 --> 33:46.584
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't know.

33:46.904 --> 33:47.905
[SPEAKER_19]: I'll probably play it again.

33:47.965 --> 33:49.886
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't really know when the stress test ends.

33:49.926 --> 33:51.748
[SPEAKER_19]: I think it's either this week or two weeks from now.

33:51.788 --> 33:52.388
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm not sure.

33:53.029 --> 33:56.731
[SPEAKER_20]: You know, I was actually watching TV last night and for some reason we have free HBO right now.

33:56.871 --> 34:00.934
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm not going to complain, but we have free HBO because I just by chance was channel surfing and I ended up on HBO.

34:01.314 --> 34:03.116
[SPEAKER_20]: And they were showing the second Matrix movie.

34:04.056 --> 34:07.279
[SPEAKER_20]: And so I started to watch it for like five minutes and I was like, I'm bored.

34:07.299 --> 34:07.819
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm going to bed.

34:10.961 --> 34:11.221
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah.

34:11.762 --> 34:13.583
[SPEAKER_19]: And I love, I don't know, it's just just

34:14.676 --> 34:42.130
[SPEAKER_19]: whatever, try it if you want but don't I'd recommend probably Final Fantasy I don't know if that was my first online game or whatever to get into I'd probably be confused it'd probably turn me off to online games it's very good if you're like a first person shooter type person and you're getting into online games that'd be the way to go because the controls are that of a first person shooter and so you'd probably feel right at home with that

34:42.523 --> 34:46.205
[SPEAKER_20]: So like if you're a Quake, Doom, Halo nut, maybe.

34:46.765 --> 34:48.026
[SPEAKER_20]: Alright, sounds good.

34:48.726 --> 34:52.628
[SPEAKER_20]: I was going to say... Ah, forget it.

34:53.208 --> 34:54.369
[SPEAKER_20]: Oh yeah, I know what I was going to say.

34:54.469 --> 34:56.389
[SPEAKER_20]: I still want to give World of Warcraft a fair shot.

34:56.670 --> 35:06.014
[SPEAKER_20]: I got to observe World of Warcraft a little bit, and it seemed interesting, but I wasn't like wowed.

35:07.120 --> 35:07.681
[SPEAKER_20]: Pun intended.

35:14.880 --> 35:19.203
[SPEAKER_30]: Magus actually picked it up, so I've been watching him play it.

35:19.583 --> 35:20.203
[SPEAKER_20]: Does it look good?

35:20.643 --> 35:22.164
[SPEAKER_30]: Yeah, it looks good.

35:22.184 --> 35:23.245
[SPEAKER_30]: I mean, it's Blizzard.

35:23.645 --> 35:29.608
[SPEAKER_30]: But it was kind of funny, because he was killing stuff, and all of a sudden I hear Diablo 2 sounds, and I'm going, huh?

35:29.628 --> 35:31.689
[SPEAKER_30]: I turn around and I'm like, oh wait, Blizzard game.

35:32.930 --> 35:34.411
[SPEAKER_20]: So they just recycled the same effects.

35:34.431 --> 35:35.051
[SPEAKER_20]: Well, you know, whatever.

35:35.071 --> 35:37.512
[SPEAKER_30]: Kind of, sort of, yeah.

35:37.992 --> 35:42.795
[SPEAKER_30]: The characters don't look as pretty as Final Fantasy XI, because it's different, so...

35:44.504 --> 36:12.056
[SPEAKER_30]: about the only funny thing that I find actually amusing is like they can do like little dances and stuff no matter what you know depending on what race you choose that was hilarious like the what the dark undead guy can like rock out and stuff it's really funny you know what's interesting is the number one thing I hear about World of Warcraft is that they say it's more built for the casual player who wants to play by themself

36:12.506 --> 36:14.166
[SPEAKER_20]: and doesn't really want to party up a whole lot.

36:14.226 --> 36:21.168
[SPEAKER_20]: And my first reaction is, well, then why play a multiplayer massive online game if you want to play by yourself?

36:23.129 --> 36:24.149
[SPEAKER_20]: That's the part I don't get.

36:24.269 --> 36:26.209
[SPEAKER_19]: But other than that... Because here's why.

36:26.229 --> 36:32.851
[SPEAKER_19]: Because when you get down to Final Fantasy or whatever in the higher levels, if you don't find a party, you're stuck.

36:32.911 --> 36:35.091
[SPEAKER_19]: You're just sitting there for hours doing nothing.

36:35.652 --> 36:37.292
[SPEAKER_19]: And that's why.

36:38.615 --> 36:40.435
[SPEAKER_19]: People will get turned off by that kind of crap.

36:40.636 --> 36:44.056
[SPEAKER_19]: Because they don't, you know, obviously, you know, they could be doing thousands of others.

36:44.076 --> 36:45.957
[SPEAKER_19]: You can find things to do even when you're high level.

36:45.977 --> 36:56.940
[SPEAKER_19]: You can find things to do, but people want to be leveling up, and they can't do that by... Because you could do, you know, in Final Fantasy XI, you could do sin thing, you could do gardening, but, you know, people don't want to...

37:05.482 --> 37:05.842
[SPEAKER_19]: DarkSakura.com

37:28.540 --> 37:30.721
[SPEAKER_20]: Let's move on, and Explicit joined us.

37:30.781 --> 37:35.144
[SPEAKER_20]: He snuck in through the door while we were talking there a little bit ago.

37:35.204 --> 37:36.104
[SPEAKER_20]: So how you doing, Explicit?

37:37.825 --> 37:39.986
[SPEAKER_26]: Pretty okay for the whole week.

37:40.186 --> 37:42.247
[SPEAKER_20]: Well, I was going to ask, how was your week, how was your day, sir?

37:42.948 --> 37:54.774
[SPEAKER_26]: Well, this whole week's been hell, been pretty much hell, due to all of unnecessary drama that's been shoved in my face the whole week.

37:56.588 --> 37:58.970
[SPEAKER_26]: Special, like, right after the tournament, of course.

37:59.571 --> 38:01.112
[SPEAKER_20]: How did things go at the tournament, by the way?

38:01.372 --> 38:09.820
[SPEAKER_26]: Okay, like, during the tournament, it went very well, because, like, I mean, we had the speakers and had the microphones to talk to people and what they think about the tournament so far.

38:11.141 --> 38:12.222
[SPEAKER_26]: And it seems pretty fair.

38:12.242 --> 38:13.703
[SPEAKER_26]: I mean, a lot of people had fun and stuff.

38:14.684 --> 38:16.525
[SPEAKER_26]: But, of course, we always get the bad news.

38:16.806 --> 38:18.647
[SPEAKER_26]: Of course, we all know, drama.

38:19.848 --> 38:21.149
[SPEAKER_20]: Drama, drama revolution.

38:21.189 --> 38:22.250
[SPEAKER_20]: Where would we be without it?

38:22.470 --> 38:22.931
[SPEAKER_26]: Yeah.

38:23.539 --> 38:28.845
[SPEAKER_26]: Unfortunately, we get somebody who was bitching about, bitching the whole time.

38:29.946 --> 38:34.051
[SPEAKER_26]: I'm like, and trying to get into the faces of the people calculating the scores.

38:34.952 --> 38:37.495
[SPEAKER_26]: Okay, let us, first of all, let us do our jobs.

38:38.456 --> 38:39.898
[SPEAKER_26]: Don't come around bitching and bitching.

38:40.038 --> 38:42.681
[SPEAKER_26]: I understand you drove like three hours away from home.

38:43.291 --> 38:43.371
[SPEAKER_26]: Hmm.

38:58.506 --> 39:08.055
[SPEAKER_26]: Of course, you get people bitching about, some people bitching about the pad issues, which is, which is starting to be common in every tournament, since B3 maybe.

39:08.836 --> 39:14.120
[SPEAKER_26]: Where someone like, bitch about, oh, I got a great, we should do a doober because the arrow's not working.

39:15.962 --> 39:17.003
[SPEAKER_20]: No, the player's not working.

39:18.144 --> 39:18.384
[SPEAKER_26]: Obviously.

39:19.040 --> 39:25.504
[SPEAKER_26]: It happened in Sunnyvale Golf Land 3 numerous times where everyone had to play one pad because the left side is not working.

39:25.785 --> 39:27.225
[SPEAKER_20]: I heard you took my suggestion though.

39:27.286 --> 39:37.252
[SPEAKER_20]: I heard that you actually made them all sign a form that says the rules are final and pad disputes will be... I heard that you made everybody sign a form.

39:37.292 --> 39:37.752
[SPEAKER_26]: Yes, I did.

39:37.992 --> 39:38.293
[SPEAKER_20]: Good.

39:38.393 --> 39:38.913
[SPEAKER_20]: Good for you.

39:39.553 --> 39:44.457
[SPEAKER_26]: Unfortunately, some people went out of the barrier.

39:44.777 --> 39:45.457
[SPEAKER_26]: Look what happened.

39:45.497 --> 39:46.298
[SPEAKER_26]: They got kicked out.

39:47.644 --> 39:49.306
[SPEAKER_26]: The one person got kicked out of the tournament.

39:49.987 --> 39:52.790
[SPEAKER_26]: See this is what happens if you start drama.

39:52.830 --> 39:56.313
[SPEAKER_26]: Before the tournament you should have asked me questions personally and during the forums.

39:56.994 --> 40:00.337
[SPEAKER_26]: I'll see what I can do with the solution so it doesn't become a rush hour.

40:01.849 --> 40:07.812
[SPEAKER_20]: I think there should be a settlement process if there is reasonable doubt that the machine's malfunctioning.

40:07.852 --> 40:11.194
[SPEAKER_20]: But what that exactly is, does it take two people bitching?

40:11.234 --> 40:12.695
[SPEAKER_20]: Does it take whatever?

40:12.715 --> 40:15.396
[SPEAKER_20]: And then what's the process to review the machine?

40:15.436 --> 40:17.117
[SPEAKER_20]: You've got to set that all up in advance.

40:17.157 --> 40:18.958
[SPEAKER_20]: I think once a reasonable process is established...

40:19.912 --> 40:23.134
[SPEAKER_20]: There's really no way you can complain about it.

40:23.354 --> 40:29.637
[SPEAKER_26]: It's a little debatable because sometimes the techs are not there to help buy the parts.

40:29.677 --> 40:34.460
[SPEAKER_26]: You know, each arrow has four sensors itself.

40:35.400 --> 40:43.805
[SPEAKER_26]: And buying 32 parts in case one of them goes dead is not really a reasonable solution because you're spending a lot of money itself because you're going to owe the whole...

40:44.716 --> 40:46.917
[SPEAKER_26]: Like vendors, money, because they're spending parts on this.

40:47.937 --> 40:51.658
[SPEAKER_26]: So you're basically going to be left in a deficit like right after the whole tournament is over.

40:53.319 --> 41:03.702
[SPEAKER_20]: The sad thing is you could bring a brand new pad in there, brand spanking new pad, and somehow it's possible it could get fucked up during the tournament and it would not work.

41:03.923 --> 41:11.265
[SPEAKER_20]: So you just have to, I don't know, you just sometimes have to just bite the bullet and accept that things aren't always going to work perfectly at the tournament.

41:11.775 --> 41:17.937
[SPEAKER_26]: Yeah, I mean, I understand that, but, I mean, this is why, like, in my opinion, I'm not trying to say, like, it's, like, unacceptable, as some people might say.

41:18.717 --> 41:23.758
[SPEAKER_26]: Some people also have to check on player styles, like, sort of like freestyle in a way.

41:23.778 --> 41:28.359
[SPEAKER_26]: You have to figure out ways to make sure you get the perfects, rather than just try to cheat your way.

41:28.379 --> 41:31.960
[SPEAKER_26]: I mean, here's a question.

41:32.040 --> 41:32.880
[SPEAKER_26]: What would you rather have?

41:33.380 --> 41:37.701
[SPEAKER_26]: Someone who would accept defeat, or someone who would actually pitch too much so they can get a do-over in favor?

41:38.061 --> 41:39.962
[SPEAKER_26]: They're part of the tournament, so they can move up.

41:40.283 --> 41:44.725
[SPEAKER_20]: Someone who takes the defeat and takes the criticism on how to get better, of course.

41:45.427 --> 42:01.739
[SPEAKER_26]: Yeah, unfortunately, it comes to a point where, oh my god, like, here's an example, like, one of the rounds, I think, somebody got, the person, like, I'm not gonna say any names, the person got, like, 13 grades, and then he claims that he got 3 grades on that song.

42:03.480 --> 42:06.783
[SPEAKER_26]: Unfortunately, he said, oh my god, I got 10 grades on the same arrow.

42:07.724 --> 42:11.306
[SPEAKER_26]: We checked his playstyle, he's been getting the grades on the wrong arrow.

42:14.048 --> 42:14.609
[SPEAKER_20]: Interesting.

42:15.680 --> 42:17.861
[SPEAKER_26]: Yeah, and then of course you've got the rules.

42:18.902 --> 42:22.264
[SPEAKER_26]: Like I said before, they should have asked beforehand so we could come up with solutions.

42:23.145 --> 42:29.809
[SPEAKER_26]: I mean, Tony did it, or should I say Andrew, he was worried about putting suggestions about dark mode.

42:30.329 --> 42:33.951
[SPEAKER_26]: I added another option, which is one speed.

42:34.311 --> 42:34.952
[SPEAKER_22]: Right.

42:35.052 --> 42:35.792
[SPEAKER_26]: One of the two ways.

42:36.072 --> 42:36.253
[SPEAKER_22]: Right.

42:36.293 --> 42:36.813
[SPEAKER_26]: I'm not going to make it...

42:37.313 --> 42:38.934
[SPEAKER_26]: The tournament's more like an advanced format.

42:38.954 --> 42:42.336
[SPEAKER_26]: It's not really like the same traditional format like everyone thinks it is.

42:43.277 --> 42:48.860
[SPEAKER_26]: I'm thinking about using a traditional so people do... It'll cause less bitching for tournaments.

42:49.120 --> 42:51.882
[SPEAKER_26]: Or cancel singles PA overall.

42:51.922 --> 43:01.568
[SPEAKER_20]: Well, you know, you gotta just... It's one of those things where I think it gets to a point where if the rules are gonna be outside the box a little bit, then if you're a competitor, you gotta review the rules, and if it's not for you, don't enter.

43:02.408 --> 43:03.629
[SPEAKER_20]: Wait for the next tournament.

43:03.649 --> 43:06.731
[SPEAKER_26]: I mean, look... I'm not trying to blame...

43:07.130 --> 43:07.490
[SPEAKER_20]: DarkReverse

43:29.777 --> 43:41.789
[SPEAKER_20]: And the complaints were kind of minimal on it, because we outlined the rules in advance and said, here are the songs, and you'll have to do it dark or verse, and if you don't like it, don't enter.

43:41.809 --> 43:44.631
[SPEAKER_26]: The thing is, I released the songs during the tournament.

43:45.352 --> 43:50.997
[SPEAKER_26]: I said in the rules completely that the songs are going to be released during the tournament.

43:51.538 --> 43:54.541
[SPEAKER_26]: There are 16 songs to choose from, from easy to hard.

43:55.086 --> 44:00.270
[SPEAKER_20]: We did this really weird setup, and I wish I could find those rules again, because I think they're actually pretty good.

44:00.571 --> 44:12.621
[SPEAKER_20]: But it was like, you could choose a song from list A, B, or C, and B would keep your score even, A would reduce your score automatically by a little bit, because they were easier songs, and C would increase your score by a little bit, because they were like 9-footers and hard songs.

44:12.641 --> 44:13.641
[SPEAKER_26]: Yeah, I know that system.

44:13.682 --> 44:14.943
[SPEAKER_26]: You guys did a teeter system.

44:15.043 --> 44:15.703
[SPEAKER_26]: Yeah.

44:15.783 --> 44:18.145
[SPEAKER_26]: I mean, that was a system that worked very well.

44:18.486 --> 44:19.807
[SPEAKER_26]: I was thinking about using it for...

44:20.908 --> 44:21.729
[SPEAKER_26]: By pissing all over it.

44:39.568 --> 44:59.860
[SPEAKER_26]: and of course you see TOs quitting tournaments because of it because they can't handle the situation and this is where I came in and take some numerous action eliminating the pests alright well anything else in your week outside the tournament how else was your week and stuff

45:01.277 --> 45:03.899
[SPEAKER_26]: Okay, I'll explain some more of the tournament later, like probably my FUs.

45:03.999 --> 45:04.240
[SPEAKER_20]: Okay.

45:04.800 --> 45:05.741
[SPEAKER_26]: Well, it's been hell.

45:06.602 --> 45:13.267
[SPEAKER_26]: And, oh yeah, of course, everyone knows about Ash Wednesday, where they had to sacrifice something for 40 days and 40 nights.

45:13.587 --> 45:14.148
[SPEAKER_20]: Oh yeah, Lent.

45:14.388 --> 45:15.129
[SPEAKER_20]: Okay.

45:15.329 --> 45:15.809
[SPEAKER_26]: I got a question.

45:15.829 --> 45:17.691
[SPEAKER_26]: Did anybody sacrifice anything for Lent?

45:18.572 --> 45:20.133
[SPEAKER_20]: I sacrificed going to church.

45:21.014 --> 45:21.354
[SPEAKER_26]: Wow.

45:22.415 --> 45:22.955
[SPEAKER_26]: Wow.

45:27.354 --> 45:31.616
[SPEAKER_20]: And all due respect, it's not my cup of tea for that stuff.

45:31.716 --> 45:35.178
[SPEAKER_20]: So no, I don't celebrate Lent.

45:36.558 --> 45:37.179
[SPEAKER_20]: What'd you give up?

45:38.099 --> 45:43.862
[SPEAKER_26]: It's pretty ashamed to say on Orange Lounge Radio, but I'll say it right now.

45:43.982 --> 45:44.202
[SPEAKER_20]: What?

45:44.422 --> 45:46.643
[SPEAKER_26]: I sacrificed getting a boner for Lent.

45:47.403 --> 45:48.424
[SPEAKER_20]: Wait, wait, wait.

45:48.484 --> 45:50.405
[SPEAKER_20]: You sacrificed getting a boner.

45:50.885 --> 45:52.866
[SPEAKER_20]: You're not allowed to get a boner for the next 40 days.

45:52.886 --> 45:53.106
[SPEAKER_26]: Yes.

45:56.616 --> 45:58.998
[SPEAKER_19]: I sacrifice masturbating with my left hand.

45:59.398 --> 46:01.620
[SPEAKER_19]: It's strictly right hand from now on.

46:02.260 --> 46:03.501
[SPEAKER_20]: Wait, wait, wait.

46:03.541 --> 46:06.563
[SPEAKER_20]: What are you going to do if that hot Asian girl with big boobs walks by?

46:06.603 --> 46:09.885
[SPEAKER_20]: Are you just going to look the other way real quick before dirty thoughts?

46:09.985 --> 46:10.586
[SPEAKER_26]: I've found ways.

46:10.606 --> 46:17.290
[SPEAKER_26]: I'm drinking a lot of water to gulp down and... It's a tough decision.

46:17.350 --> 46:20.532
[SPEAKER_26]: It's basically a land that no man has gone before.

46:20.552 --> 46:20.752
[SPEAKER_26]: Wait...

46:21.926 --> 46:23.127
[SPEAKER_20]: You gotta tape it down.

46:23.988 --> 46:29.232
[SPEAKER_20]: That's what you're gonna have to do, is you're going to have to tuck your penis back and make yourself have a vagina.

46:29.272 --> 46:31.994
[SPEAKER_20]: That's the only way you're gonna stop getting a boner all together.

46:32.054 --> 46:33.855
[SPEAKER_29]: Oh boy, he really wants one of those!

46:33.955 --> 46:36.758
[SPEAKER_19]: Even that is not, you know, foolproof either, I mean.

46:38.719 --> 46:45.965
[SPEAKER_19]: That is like, I'd like to compare it to like the octopus, you know, where you have multiple brains, you know, octopuses, octopi have...

46:46.798 --> 46:52.663
[SPEAKER_19]: multiple brains, they have brains that control their feet, or their tentacles, or whatever, and, you know, their normal brain.

46:53.843 --> 46:59.748
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm sorry, but once that signal, once you see, once Hot Girl's signal has gone down to their brain, it's all over.

46:59.828 --> 47:03.891
[SPEAKER_20]: What are you going to do if you wake up in the morning, and then you're like, Oh, fuck!

47:04.852 --> 47:05.693
[SPEAKER_20]: God hates me!

47:05.813 --> 47:06.473
[SPEAKER_20]: What are you going to do?

47:07.174 --> 47:08.315
[SPEAKER_26]: So, wait, here's the thing.

47:08.355 --> 47:09.856
[SPEAKER_26]: So far, I've actually survived.

47:10.276 --> 47:11.477
[SPEAKER_26]: I'm not going to need a boner.

47:12.078 --> 47:13.779
[SPEAKER_26]: I've seen attractive women, but no boner.

47:15.484 --> 47:17.145
[SPEAKER_26]: and I woke up, no boner.

47:17.505 --> 47:18.826
[SPEAKER_26]: I took a piss, no boner.

47:22.287 --> 47:23.688
[SPEAKER_20]: Does like a semi count?

47:25.009 --> 47:27.790
[SPEAKER_26]: And here's the thing, no, I'm not taking any anti-viagra.

47:30.271 --> 47:30.792
[SPEAKER_21]: Wow.

47:31.212 --> 47:31.772
[SPEAKER_21]: Wow.

47:32.333 --> 47:37.855
[SPEAKER_26]: So yes, it's a challenge, but I'm living up to my word, no boner for the next 40 days.

47:38.175 --> 47:40.277
[SPEAKER_20]: I hate to say it, but keep us posted.

47:41.317 --> 47:42.057
[SPEAKER_26]: It's on my LJ.

47:42.958 --> 47:43.378
[SPEAKER_20]: Alright.

47:44.158 --> 47:45.099
[SPEAKER_26]: For those who want to check out

47:46.217 --> 47:55.323
[SPEAKER_20]: You know if he comes back here on day 39, I'm going to have like the rotating, you know, big-titted Asian prawn hentai, everything going on the screen in here.

47:55.443 --> 47:59.186
[SPEAKER_19]: I should have like a sign that says, you know, gone this many days without wood.

48:02.768 --> 48:03.189
[SPEAKER_20]: Wow.

48:04.790 --> 48:05.230
[SPEAKER_20]: Amazing.

48:08.752 --> 48:09.093
[SPEAKER_20]: Alright.

48:10.273 --> 48:10.634
[SPEAKER_20]: My way...

48:15.615 --> 48:20.257
[SPEAKER_20]: I could take that down the gutter even further, but for the sake of humanity, I'm not going to.

48:21.177 --> 48:21.978
[SPEAKER_20]: Good luck, my friend.

48:22.018 --> 48:22.358
[SPEAKER_20]: Good luck.

48:22.458 --> 48:23.098
[SPEAKER_20]: That's all I have to say.

48:23.118 --> 48:23.458
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh, come on, man.

48:23.498 --> 48:24.519
[SPEAKER_19]: We need time to kill.

48:25.059 --> 48:25.599
[SPEAKER_20]: No, it's all right.

48:25.639 --> 48:25.999
[SPEAKER_20]: It's all right.

48:26.339 --> 48:26.719
[SPEAKER_20]: Trust me.

48:26.899 --> 48:27.640
[SPEAKER_20]: You don't want me to go there.

48:31.761 --> 48:34.242
[SPEAKER_20]: Sorry, I'm having a comedy show in my mind.

48:34.282 --> 48:35.943
[SPEAKER_20]: This is why we'll never make it.

48:36.543 --> 48:37.023
[SPEAKER_20]: Seriously.

48:41.471 --> 48:43.515
[SPEAKER_20]: The folks from Satellite Radio are listening right now.

48:43.615 --> 48:50.026
[SPEAKER_20]: Oh, we just found out about this program that's all about gaming and these people here are all into gaming and they've done it for years.

48:50.046 --> 48:50.868
[SPEAKER_20]: They've got to be good at this.

48:51.389 --> 48:52.090
[SPEAKER_20]: Now they're tuning in.

48:53.007 --> 48:54.828
[SPEAKER_20]: You're going to get a boner in 40 days.

48:54.848 --> 48:56.528
[SPEAKER_20]: You can't go 40 days without a boner.

48:56.728 --> 48:58.669
[SPEAKER_20]: We're going to put big-titted women on the screen.

48:58.909 --> 49:11.634
[SPEAKER_19]: To tell you how much G4 has sold out to just, you know, selling everything with sex on their damn station, because that's, I guess, the only way they think it's going to work, they're going to have some football game coverage featuring the Lingerie Bowl girls.

49:13.455 --> 49:14.395
[SPEAKER_20]: Oh, yeah, that's game-related.

49:15.176 --> 49:15.436
[SPEAKER_20]: Oh, yeah.

49:18.317 --> 49:20.298
[SPEAKER_20]: Is that the tech TV part of the station?

49:20.518 --> 49:20.538
[SPEAKER_20]: I...

49:22.546 --> 49:22.786
[SPEAKER_17]: Anyway.

49:23.447 --> 49:24.888
[SPEAKER_20]: No, no, see, you forget.

49:25.008 --> 49:27.090
[SPEAKER_20]: Tech TV's no longer part of the station.

49:27.250 --> 49:28.371
[SPEAKER_20]: Oh, my bad, my bad.

49:29.733 --> 49:30.053
[SPEAKER_20]: Anyway.

49:31.969 --> 49:34.211
[SPEAKER_20]: My week and my day, since we didn't get around to it yet.

49:34.691 --> 49:36.053
[SPEAKER_20]: My week and my day were pretty good.

49:36.633 --> 49:40.256
[SPEAKER_20]: I went out to the clubs last night, you know, shaking my thing.

49:40.296 --> 49:43.159
[SPEAKER_20]: And it's so hilarious when you hear DDR songs at the club.

49:43.659 --> 49:49.925
[SPEAKER_20]: I know I'm such a loser for thinking that, but you know, we were dancing in the room where all the videos come on.

49:50.205 --> 49:52.928
[SPEAKER_20]: And they played shiny disco balls, you know, from Ultramix.

49:54.309 --> 49:58.913
[SPEAKER_20]: And I just... To illusion in the chat room, we call those weekdays.

50:14.191 --> 50:20.055
[SPEAKER_19]: Loki should have a spin-off show where he feels on big-breasted Asian girls and shouts racial slurs for two straight hours.

50:20.696 --> 50:21.757
[SPEAKER_19]: I call those weekdays.

50:22.817 --> 50:23.578
[SPEAKER_20]: Alright, alright.

50:24.018 --> 50:25.199
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm sorry, Explosive, you were saying?

50:25.719 --> 50:29.342
[SPEAKER_26]: Speaking of that, guess what I heard on 24 Hour Fitness when I was working out?

50:30.512 --> 50:31.793
[SPEAKER_26]: Someone actually played... Butterfly.

50:32.013 --> 50:32.193
[SPEAKER_26]: No.

50:33.174 --> 50:33.995
[SPEAKER_26]: Era from TAC.

50:34.695 --> 50:34.995
[SPEAKER_26]: What?

50:35.396 --> 50:36.136
[SPEAKER_26]: I'm serious.

50:36.456 --> 50:40.699
[SPEAKER_26]: I was working out with the weights, and I heard Era.

50:40.719 --> 50:42.981
[SPEAKER_26]: I'm like, what the fuck?

50:44.482 --> 50:46.263
[SPEAKER_20]: On like the 24... What do they have in there?

50:46.283 --> 50:48.925
[SPEAKER_20]: Like a 24-hour fitness radio station or music?

50:48.945 --> 50:49.766
[SPEAKER_26]: No, they play it regular.

50:49.786 --> 50:54.429
[SPEAKER_26]: They play any songs that people put in their music box and play it all.

50:54.790 --> 50:59.273
[SPEAKER_26]: They play like some of the stuff from DDR Max, like Sandstorm or...

51:00.828 --> 51:04.489
[SPEAKER_20]: I know that Jamie had burned a CD for her spin group.

51:04.629 --> 51:05.850
[SPEAKER_20]: They do the bike spin thing.

51:06.350 --> 51:08.010
[SPEAKER_20]: But I don't know how many Bomani Shants she put on.

51:08.030 --> 51:10.191
[SPEAKER_20]: I think it was mostly like top 40 junk.

51:10.531 --> 51:13.732
[SPEAKER_20]: And this was funny to burn one of these CDs for Jamie to have to make her, you know.

51:13.932 --> 51:15.513
[SPEAKER_20]: But they had to get something that was friendly to everybody.

51:15.533 --> 51:20.774
[SPEAKER_20]: She's like, and of course she comes to me, Rob, do you have Toxic by Britney?

51:20.794 --> 51:23.555
[SPEAKER_26]: Oh, wait a minute, wait a minute.

51:23.575 --> 51:23.995
[SPEAKER_20]: What, what?

51:24.376 --> 51:25.456
[SPEAKER_26]: I see a comment about...

51:27.883 --> 51:28.503
[SPEAKER_26]: laugh out loud.

51:28.543 --> 51:31.605
[SPEAKER_26]: It's even more crazy to see someone doing DDR steps in clubs.

51:31.645 --> 51:32.626
[SPEAKER_20]: I was just getting to that.

51:32.686 --> 51:38.730
[SPEAKER_20]: When Shiny Disco Balls came on, I was kind of like dancing like, disco, disco, disco, like doing the little steps.

51:38.750 --> 51:56.083
[SPEAKER_26]: Speaking of that, speaking of that, okay, this is, speaking of, speaking relating to the tournament, I know it's over, but I found out the reason why someone wanted to win first place was to take this girl to this junior prom and to realize, I would, I would imagine if he does DDR in a freaking prom.

51:57.119 --> 51:57.900
[SPEAKER_20]: Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

51:58.560 --> 52:02.543
[SPEAKER_20]: Some guy wanted to win the tournament because if he won the tournament... Like money and stuff?

52:03.404 --> 52:04.004
[SPEAKER_20]: Oh, okay.

52:04.044 --> 52:06.626
[SPEAKER_20]: I thought the girl wouldn't date him unless he won the tournament type thing.

52:06.646 --> 52:07.487
[SPEAKER_25]: I know the girl, too.

52:07.807 --> 52:09.428
[SPEAKER_20]: Oh, okay.

52:09.448 --> 52:15.433
[SPEAKER_20]: That's a really bad setup for like DDR Freak the movie, you know, like... Never mind.

52:15.753 --> 52:17.374
[SPEAKER_26]: Yeah, you know, this is ridiculous.

52:17.414 --> 52:19.476
[SPEAKER_26]: It's very sad, but true.

52:19.496 --> 52:19.576
[SPEAKER_19]: True.

52:21.616 --> 52:26.458
[SPEAKER_19]: You basically have to rip off the whole storyline for 10K Commotion.

52:26.758 --> 52:29.339
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm not having another DDR Freak movie discussion.

52:30.419 --> 52:31.920
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm not having it again on the show.

52:31.940 --> 52:33.701
[SPEAKER_19]: You should be 10K Commotion the movie.

52:33.741 --> 52:35.041
[SPEAKER_19]: That would be the only way it would work.

52:35.581 --> 52:35.981
[SPEAKER_19]: Only way.

52:36.482 --> 52:37.142
[SPEAKER_19]: No other way.

52:37.442 --> 52:41.423
[SPEAKER_19]: None of this robot chick Asian person dancer.

52:41.904 --> 52:42.084
[SPEAKER_19]: No.

52:42.584 --> 52:43.544
[SPEAKER_20]: Can I talk about my week?

52:44.945 --> 52:45.305
[SPEAKER_19]: I guess.

52:45.405 --> 52:45.685
[SPEAKER_20]: All right.

52:46.331 --> 53:11.769
[SPEAKER_20]: So, Friday night I was hanging out with some friends and we went over to Rice Princess' house, you know, the one from Outside the Box, although we haven't really done Outside the Box in several weeks, which I apologize for, but, you know, there's just been other circumstances coming up and the show may be moved or retooled in the near future, so I appreciate those of you guys who are bearing with us, but we just have a lot of other crap that's been getting in the way, so something might change with that.

53:11.849 --> 53:14.291
[SPEAKER_20]: Anyway, but as far as

53:14.711 --> 53:15.631
[SPEAKER_20]: Friday nights go.

53:15.872 --> 53:22.214
[SPEAKER_20]: I saw, for the very first time in my life, and I know this is hard to believe, I had never seen The Fifth Element before, the movie.

53:22.514 --> 53:23.555
[SPEAKER_20]: I finally saw it Friday night.

53:25.256 --> 53:28.577
[SPEAKER_20]: It was very gay, really.

53:30.398 --> 53:31.919
[SPEAKER_20]: Like the costumes and everything.

53:32.559 --> 53:34.020
[SPEAKER_20]: No, I don't know how to describe it.

53:34.200 --> 53:35.340
[SPEAKER_20]: It was alright, I guess.

53:35.660 --> 53:41.563
[SPEAKER_20]: Although, the thing I thought was kind of cool about The Fifth Element was that it was kind of like a video game plot.

53:42.143 --> 53:42.703
[SPEAKER_20]: It really was.

53:42.763 --> 53:44.164
[SPEAKER_20]: It was a total video game plot.

53:45.916 --> 53:48.398
[SPEAKER_20]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

54:06.044 --> 54:07.706
[SPEAKER_20]: We're going to look at the other half now.

54:07.766 --> 54:11.970
[SPEAKER_20]: We did some, you know, happy, lovey-dovey songs in the first break.

54:12.030 --> 54:16.414
[SPEAKER_20]: Now we're going to do some angry songs for Singles Awareness Day.

54:16.714 --> 54:17.495
[SPEAKER_20]: Some anger.

54:18.415 --> 54:21.318
[SPEAKER_26]: Speaking of Valentine's Day as well, coming up.

54:21.939 --> 54:22.179
[SPEAKER_20]: What?

54:22.639 --> 54:23.200
[SPEAKER_20]: A quick thought?

54:23.660 --> 54:23.921
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah?

54:24.241 --> 54:25.502
[SPEAKER_20]: Are you doing anything for Valentine's Day?

54:25.782 --> 54:27.124
[SPEAKER_20]: Unfortunately, no.

54:27.284 --> 54:28.925
[SPEAKER_20]: It's a good thing, or else you might get a boner.

54:29.846 --> 54:30.747
[SPEAKER_26]: Oh, yeah, that's true.

54:31.468 --> 54:31.928
[SPEAKER_26]: That is true.

54:32.358 --> 54:38.343
[SPEAKER_26]: Oh wait, wait, actually no, that'll make it worse because I gotta work after school and... Yeah.

54:38.803 --> 54:39.144
[SPEAKER_26]: Alright.

54:39.224 --> 54:40.705
[SPEAKER_26]: Deal with people smooching.

54:42.747 --> 54:45.589
[SPEAKER_26]: Each and every time.

54:45.669 --> 54:47.050
[SPEAKER_26]: The desire is increasing.

54:48.011 --> 54:49.633
[SPEAKER_20]: Alright, we'll be back after this.

54:49.653 --> 54:56.218
[SPEAKER_20]: We're gonna start it off with an angry Korean, and then we'll be back with more Orange Launch Radio, including some actual Vimani news, believe it or not.

54:56.238 --> 54:59.461
[SPEAKER_20]: There's quite a little bit going on this week, so we're gonna talk about that when we come back after this.

56:35.212 --> 56:36.153
Thank you for watching!

58:12.612 --> 58:13.152
[SPEAKER_14]: and many more.

58:40.430 --> 58:41.430
Thank you for watching!

59:07.168 --> 59:08.349
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, yeah, yeah

59:29.284 --> 59:30.786
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

01:01:31.058 --> 01:01:39.603
[SPEAKER_31]: Hiho, Kermit the Frog here, informing you that today's broadcast of Orange Lounge Radio is brought to you by the letter B, the letter A, and the number 59.

01:01:39.643 --> 01:01:45.466
[SPEAKER_14]: Can you tell me how to get, how to get to Sesame Street?

01:01:45.826 --> 01:01:49.409
[SPEAKER_20]: We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 131.

01:01:50.969 --> 01:01:57.033
[SPEAKER_20]: A happy early Valentine's Day to all of you people out there, or Singles Awareness Day, whatever the case may be for you.

01:01:58.280 --> 01:02:00.542
[SPEAKER_20]: As promised, we're going to talk about some Bavani news right now.

01:02:00.622 --> 01:02:03.784
[SPEAKER_20]: Big news, Dancing Stage Unleashed 2.

01:02:04.464 --> 01:02:06.726
[SPEAKER_20]: At least if you're in Europe, this will be big news to you.

01:02:06.806 --> 01:02:09.208
[SPEAKER_20]: For everybody else, not so big a news.

01:02:09.268 --> 01:02:11.269
[SPEAKER_20]: But at least there's a new DDR game on the way.

01:02:11.870 --> 01:02:12.310
[SPEAKER_20]: What do you know?

01:02:13.911 --> 01:02:15.993
[SPEAKER_20]: A few tracks have already been announced for this game.

01:02:16.033 --> 01:02:16.573
[SPEAKER_20]: Pretty cool.

01:02:16.953 --> 01:02:18.855
[SPEAKER_20]: Basement Jax, where's your head at?

01:02:19.675 --> 01:02:25.980
[SPEAKER_20]: Girls Aloud, Love Machine, Happy Mondays, Step On, Supergrass, Alright.

01:02:26.556 --> 01:02:32.277
[SPEAKER_20]: Donna Summer, Hot Stuff, The Jam, A Town Called Malice.

01:02:32.958 --> 01:02:36.058
[SPEAKER_20]: All of them supposedly supposed to have the background videos to them as well.

01:02:36.959 --> 01:02:37.779
[SPEAKER_20]: Very interesting.

01:02:37.919 --> 01:02:38.799
[SPEAKER_20]: Also, you know what else?

01:02:39.379 --> 01:02:46.341
[SPEAKER_20]: Basically, by the way, for those who don't know, Dancing Stage Unleashed, it's basically going to be their version of Ultramix 2.

01:02:47.441 --> 01:02:48.682
[SPEAKER_20]: So, they're getting that.

01:02:49.322 --> 01:02:54.203
[SPEAKER_20]: What's very interesting about this, though, the rumor is that you're going to be able to play this on Xbox Live.

01:02:54.733 --> 01:02:59.576
[SPEAKER_20]: You'll be able to play against people in the US if you're in Canada.

01:03:00.116 --> 01:03:03.939
[SPEAKER_20]: But only on those songs that the two games share.

01:03:05.220 --> 01:03:09.582
[SPEAKER_20]: So that should be interesting though, is that now you can settle the score with any of your buddies that live in Europe.

01:03:09.942 --> 01:03:11.924
[SPEAKER_20]: You can actually play on Xbox Live against them.

01:03:12.744 --> 01:03:13.985
[SPEAKER_20]: Loki, your thoughts on Unleashed 2?

01:03:16.106 --> 01:03:17.027
[SPEAKER_19]: Really just nothing new.

01:03:17.797 --> 01:03:22.639
[SPEAKER_19]: as far as gameplay features other than the online thing.

01:03:24.640 --> 01:03:36.306
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm interested to see, though, because you know how Ultramix 2, they had their deal with a different drum, what they're going to do as far as the extra music for this game.

01:03:36.366 --> 01:03:40.448
[SPEAKER_19]: I wonder if they're going to team up with maybe a UK label or something like that.

01:03:40.708 --> 01:03:44.510
[SPEAKER_19]: That would be what I'm waiting for to see what's going to happen there.

01:03:48.450 --> 01:03:52.054
[SPEAKER_20]: Any thoughts on Unleashed 2 from Angel or Explicit?

01:03:55.057 --> 01:03:55.818
[SPEAKER_30]: Sounds pretty cool.

01:03:56.158 --> 01:04:03.345
[SPEAKER_30]: I mean, there's a couple songs that they always get that we don't, that I wish that we had, but, you know, I can keep wishing, whatever.

01:04:04.887 --> 01:04:07.950
[SPEAKER_20]: I know, it seems like Europe always gets these awesome licenses, don't they?

01:04:08.591 --> 01:04:08.731
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah.

01:04:08.751 --> 01:04:10.833
[SPEAKER_20]: Basie and Jax is awesome, and they're getting, oh man.

01:04:11.428 --> 01:04:11.668
[SPEAKER_30]: See?

01:04:11.848 --> 01:04:12.629
[SPEAKER_30]: Now you're bummed too.

01:04:12.809 --> 01:04:13.370
[SPEAKER_20]: I know.

01:04:13.470 --> 01:04:14.010
[SPEAKER_20]: A little bit.

01:04:14.450 --> 01:04:15.151
[SPEAKER_20]: I want them all.

01:04:15.211 --> 01:04:15.771
[SPEAKER_20]: I want all those.

01:04:16.092 --> 01:04:18.193
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm tempted to get a Europe PS2 at this point.

01:04:18.253 --> 01:04:19.574
[SPEAKER_20]: Although this is going to be for Xbox.

01:04:19.955 --> 01:04:22.417
[SPEAKER_20]: I still want a Europe PS2 just to get all the games.

01:04:22.937 --> 01:04:25.979
[SPEAKER_20]: But of course then I'd have to get the converter so the TV would show it.

01:04:26.420 --> 01:04:27.681
[SPEAKER_20]: It's just not worth it that much.

01:04:27.801 --> 01:04:28.181
[SPEAKER_20]: I don't know.

01:04:29.182 --> 01:04:29.602
[SPEAKER_20]: Exquisite?

01:04:30.123 --> 01:04:30.483
[SPEAKER_20]: Your thoughts?

01:04:30.703 --> 01:04:35.407
[SPEAKER_26]: Well, I'm thinking it's the same songs and different steps.

01:04:35.687 --> 01:04:36.748
[SPEAKER_26]: New songs and new steps.

01:04:36.788 --> 01:04:38.449
[SPEAKER_26]: That's basically what I'm hearing so far.

01:04:38.469 --> 01:04:40.671
[SPEAKER_26]: We got the Xbox Lite like I stated earlier.

01:04:41.926 --> 01:04:42.846
[SPEAKER_26]: Good thought.

01:04:42.866 --> 01:04:45.288
[SPEAKER_26]: I would be interested to know if they're going to get the song packs as well.

01:04:45.308 --> 01:04:45.608
[SPEAKER_26]: Who knows?

01:04:45.628 --> 01:04:49.429
[SPEAKER_26]: Because that would be a whole lot of songs that you could play, you know, against.

01:04:49.449 --> 01:04:50.670
[SPEAKER_26]: Because how many songs is it going to share with...

01:05:11.195 --> 01:05:11.656
[SPEAKER_20]: Ultramix 2.

01:05:12.036 --> 01:05:12.436
[SPEAKER_20]: I don't know.

01:05:12.516 --> 01:05:12.916
[SPEAKER_20]: Probably.

01:05:13.357 --> 01:05:17.419
[SPEAKER_20]: I mean, I guess you can probably bet that most of the Konami originals are going to carry over.

01:05:17.459 --> 01:05:19.480
[SPEAKER_20]: Things like, I don't know, Zero One, Root 80s.

01:05:19.520 --> 01:05:21.202
[SPEAKER_13]: The staple songs that everybody wants.

01:05:21.362 --> 01:05:22.142
[SPEAKER_20]: But, I don't know.

01:05:22.162 --> 01:05:22.903
[SPEAKER_20]: Will they all?

01:05:22.983 --> 01:05:23.463
[SPEAKER_20]: Who knows?

01:05:23.663 --> 01:05:24.203
[SPEAKER_20]: We don't know yet.

01:05:24.363 --> 01:05:26.265
[SPEAKER_20]: So, we shall see.

01:05:27.425 --> 01:05:28.746
[SPEAKER_26]: But then we always have Step Mania.

01:05:29.967 --> 01:05:33.189
[SPEAKER_26]: But then we always have Step Mania in case we don't get the songs.

01:05:34.049 --> 01:05:38.372
[SPEAKER_26]: Like Ultramix 3 or Extreme 2 or even with DDR with Mario.

01:05:39.329 --> 01:05:43.312
[SPEAKER_20]: You know, I'm just looking forward to getting to kick some British ass on Xbox Live, actually.

01:05:43.412 --> 01:05:44.713
[SPEAKER_20]: No, I'm kidding.

01:05:45.493 --> 01:05:46.634
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm going to get hate mail from that one.

01:05:47.114 --> 01:05:51.858
[SPEAKER_20]: Actually, I can't wait to start hearing some of those sexy, sexy accents through the speaker.

01:05:53.299 --> 01:05:53.819
[SPEAKER_26]: Name some.

01:05:54.299 --> 01:05:57.422
[SPEAKER_20]: You know the, hello, I hope you're having a good day.

01:05:58.663 --> 01:06:00.524
[SPEAKER_20]: Would you like to do some DD on, then have some tea?

01:06:00.544 --> 01:06:03.586
[SPEAKER_25]: Of course.

01:06:05.451 --> 01:06:08.534
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm getting so much hate mail from anybody that's listening to this in Europe right now.

01:06:08.574 --> 01:06:09.575
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm just joking.

01:06:10.235 --> 01:06:11.276
[SPEAKER_20]: Okay, I'm in California.

01:06:11.356 --> 01:06:14.198
[SPEAKER_20]: Haha, we all have blonde hair and blue eyes and go surfing, huh?

01:06:14.879 --> 01:06:15.539
[SPEAKER_26]: What?

01:06:18.541 --> 01:06:22.525
[SPEAKER_20]: Oh, that could be interesting because you might be playing people in other countries.

01:06:22.685 --> 01:06:23.285
[SPEAKER_20]: Is that possible?

01:06:24.086 --> 01:06:26.768
[SPEAKER_20]: Do they sell the stuff outside of...

01:06:27.538 --> 01:06:29.579
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you for watching, and I'll see you next time.

01:06:51.829 --> 01:06:54.150
[SPEAKER_20]: We can speak the universal language of kickin' ass!

01:06:54.751 --> 01:06:58.713
[SPEAKER_26]: Oh, get it up.

01:06:59.153 --> 01:07:02.095
[SPEAKER_30]: Did I tell you about the last time I beat an Asian on DDR?

01:07:04.036 --> 01:07:04.496
[SPEAKER_20]: Wait, what?

01:07:04.756 --> 01:07:06.137
[SPEAKER_30]: Even though that was a long-ass time ago?

01:07:06.157 --> 01:07:06.918
[SPEAKER_25]: What was this, Angel?

01:07:06.958 --> 01:07:07.178
[SPEAKER_30]: What?

01:07:08.859 --> 01:07:12.521
[SPEAKER_30]: Oh, I actually beat an Asian playing DDR6 Mix.

01:07:13.604 --> 01:07:14.224
[SPEAKER_20]: How old was she?

01:07:14.304 --> 01:07:14.584
[SPEAKER_20]: Six?

01:07:15.744 --> 01:07:17.365
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm just kidding.

01:07:19.345 --> 01:07:20.806
[SPEAKER_30]: He was like 19 or something.

01:07:22.806 --> 01:07:28.167
[SPEAKER_30]: He didn't believe that there was actually American people playing DDR and all that stuff.

01:07:29.287 --> 01:07:30.548
[SPEAKER_30]: It was kind of funny.

01:07:32.628 --> 01:07:33.148
[SPEAKER_30]: That's cool.

01:07:34.288 --> 01:07:35.849
[SPEAKER_30]: It was in the middle of Japan.

01:07:35.929 --> 01:07:36.509
[SPEAKER_30]: We know this.

01:07:37.523 --> 01:07:38.684
[SPEAKER_30]: This was like two years ago.

01:07:38.724 --> 01:07:45.087
[SPEAKER_20]: And it's so funny because, you know, some folks make the assumption that instantly, oh, we're all going to get killed by the Japanese on DDR if this happens.

01:07:45.527 --> 01:07:46.227
[SPEAKER_20]: But you know what?

01:07:46.567 --> 01:07:50.549
[SPEAKER_20]: Just like they're shitty American players, they're shitty Japanese players, you know?

01:07:50.869 --> 01:07:54.571
[SPEAKER_20]: Everybody's new to DDR at some point, so, you know, you've got to start somewhere.

01:07:54.711 --> 01:07:59.654
[SPEAKER_30]: Until you watch some Japanese girl walk up to the TDX machine and just completely own everyone else.

01:08:00.274 --> 01:08:00.834
[SPEAKER_30]: That was insane.

01:08:01.275 --> 01:08:01.575
[SPEAKER_30]: Okay.

01:08:03.536 --> 01:08:05.897
[SPEAKER_26]: Anyways, you've got people saying, yo, kero DDR.

01:08:07.313 --> 01:08:08.073
[SPEAKER_20]: Oh my god.

01:08:09.734 --> 01:08:10.394
[SPEAKER_20]: Just stop.

01:08:10.594 --> 01:08:11.775
[SPEAKER_20]: Seriously, stop.

01:08:16.717 --> 01:08:17.637
[SPEAKER_20]: More news going on.

01:08:17.737 --> 01:08:21.599
[SPEAKER_20]: Actually, I don't know if you guys noticed, but DDR Freak had a whole lot of news this week.

01:08:21.639 --> 01:08:23.579
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm sure a lot of you guys are watching DDR Freak.

01:08:23.920 --> 01:08:28.581
[SPEAKER_20]: And we, of course, have to show a little love to DDR Freak because they replay us on their Friday nights on DDR Freak Radio.

01:08:29.722 --> 01:08:30.162
[SPEAKER_20]: Kisses.

01:08:31.255 --> 01:08:32.397
[SPEAKER_20]: So they have a lot of stuff.

01:08:32.778 --> 01:08:37.086
[SPEAKER_20]: And really what I've noticed this week is a whole lot of looking for people.

01:08:37.427 --> 01:08:38.408
[SPEAKER_20]: They're looking for people.

01:08:38.428 --> 01:08:39.290
[SPEAKER_20]: There's all sorts of stuff.

01:08:39.470 --> 01:08:41.154
[SPEAKER_20]: It's like casting calls left and right.

01:08:41.194 --> 01:08:42.115
[SPEAKER_20]: They're looking for people.

01:08:42.175 --> 01:08:42.757
[SPEAKER_20]: It's interesting.

01:08:44.201 --> 01:08:51.148
[SPEAKER_20]: Speaking of Yokiro DDR, a Spanish language network was looking for a Spanish-speaking DDR player.

01:08:51.448 --> 01:08:52.529
[SPEAKER_20]: We don't know what's going on.

01:08:52.609 --> 01:08:54.071
[SPEAKER_20]: I don't know what ended up happening with that.

01:08:54.271 --> 01:08:56.733
[SPEAKER_20]: I didn't end up reading the comments, but they were looking for somebody.

01:08:58.395 --> 01:09:06.883
[SPEAKER_20]: First for Women magazine was looking for a mother who lost weight playing DDR with their kid, which I think, you know what, I think that's kind of neat.

01:09:07.183 --> 01:09:07.724
[SPEAKER_20]: That's kind of cool.

01:09:08.376 --> 01:09:12.382
[SPEAKER_20]: I know my mom wouldn't even know how to turn on a PlayStation, let alone get up and play DDR.

01:09:12.402 --> 01:09:14.084
[SPEAKER_26]: Cool mommies, not mine.

01:09:19.119 --> 01:09:21.500
[SPEAKER_20]: And this is a call that everybody could participate on.

01:09:21.540 --> 01:09:23.380
[SPEAKER_20]: This is what I thought was really cool.

01:09:23.600 --> 01:09:26.541
[SPEAKER_20]: DDR Freak was helping out the Make-A-Wish Foundation of Indiana.

01:09:26.601 --> 01:09:28.681
[SPEAKER_20]: They were helping this child's dream come true.

01:09:29.662 --> 01:09:35.843
[SPEAKER_20]: This child, Robbie, has a kidney disease, and his wish was for a game room in his home featuring DDR.

01:09:36.203 --> 01:09:42.265
[SPEAKER_20]: So they just rallied the troops together to buy him just the supremo setup for DDR.

01:09:42.285 --> 01:09:42.945
[SPEAKER_20]: So that's kind of cool.

01:09:43.205 --> 01:09:44.465
[SPEAKER_20]: If you're interested in that, check it out.

01:09:44.545 --> 01:09:46.846
[SPEAKER_20]: It's the February 10th headline over on DDRFreak.com.

01:09:47.774 --> 01:09:48.955
[SPEAKER_20]: is certainly worth participating in.

01:09:49.496 --> 01:09:58.543
[SPEAKER_20]: And Red Octane, this was just announced recently, Red Octane's going to be doing a focus group in Sunnyvale this Friday and next Friday.

01:09:59.064 --> 01:10:06.070
[SPEAKER_20]: And I guess if you participate, which, by the way, is at 7 o'clock, you have to have your own transportation to Sunnyvale, so if you're on the East Coast, sorry, you're screwed.

01:10:06.090 --> 01:10:09.433
[SPEAKER_20]: But if you're somewhere in the Bay Area, Red Octane will provide dinner.

01:10:10.594 --> 01:10:11.454
[SPEAKER_20]: I wonder what kind of dinner.

01:10:11.474 --> 01:10:13.276
[SPEAKER_26]: All right.

01:10:14.819 --> 01:10:17.581
[SPEAKER_20]: Maybe I should write and inquire, are we going to get Black Angus?

01:10:17.661 --> 01:10:19.222
[SPEAKER_20]: Or are you going to get, like, you know, McD's?

01:10:19.242 --> 01:10:22.725
[SPEAKER_26]: It's Friday, February 18th and Friday, February 25th at 7 o'clock.

01:10:22.745 --> 01:10:23.205
[SPEAKER_26]: You know what?

01:10:23.245 --> 01:10:26.188
[SPEAKER_26]: What's funny is I'm actually tempted to sign up for it.

01:10:26.208 --> 01:10:26.708
[SPEAKER_26]: I'm so damn curious.

01:10:26.748 --> 01:10:26.868
[SPEAKER_26]: I just...

01:10:43.422 --> 01:10:43.943
[SPEAKER_20]: RedOctane GotSkill

01:11:01.756 --> 01:11:03.277
[SPEAKER_26]: I wish I could go, but I can't.

01:11:03.917 --> 01:11:11.441
[SPEAKER_26]: Plus, people say it's a bad idea to even go anyways because, you know, some people will still get heated up with drama from the last tournament.

01:11:11.561 --> 01:11:12.341
[SPEAKER_26]: It's just stupid.

01:11:13.002 --> 01:11:13.762
[SPEAKER_26]: People should grow.

01:11:13.802 --> 01:11:17.924
[SPEAKER_26]: I mean, I don't want that, which is the reason why I won't be going as well.

01:11:18.965 --> 01:11:21.066
[SPEAKER_26]: So I'll let people take care of their business there.

01:11:22.492 --> 01:11:25.033
[SPEAKER_20]: You're a bitter, bitter man after some of these tournaments, aren't you?

01:11:25.473 --> 01:11:30.596
[SPEAKER_26]: No, because I'm always bitter to those who can't accept defeat or think they're 100% correct.

01:11:31.236 --> 01:11:33.917
[SPEAKER_26]: When they're obviously not, they can't admit their own mistakes.

01:11:35.698 --> 01:11:37.899
[SPEAKER_26]: Instead of trying to get better, they just whine.

01:11:38.359 --> 01:11:40.560
[SPEAKER_26]: So, I'm just going to leave it as is.

01:11:41.260 --> 01:11:43.021
[SPEAKER_26]: Some of the competitors I know are going to go there.

01:11:43.801 --> 01:11:44.802
[SPEAKER_26]: Some of the Sacktown people...

01:11:46.304 --> 01:11:49.828
[SPEAKER_26]: Team Piss or There's actually a Team Piss now?

01:11:49.968 --> 01:12:02.545
[SPEAKER_26]: No, just Team PI Some people call it the Paradise Island Sacktown Squad but it's just called Team PI Not Team Piss Interesting No more piss jokes now I'm trying

01:12:03.482 --> 01:12:21.593
[SPEAKER_20]: Alright, if you guys are interested in the Red Octane Focus group, you can check that out on www.ddrfreak.com I'm sure there will be non-disclosure agreements involved, so even if we do get to check it out, if I do decide I want to put in and I get picked, I probably won't be able to talk about it, but, you know, it'll be still kind of neat to see.

01:12:21.913 --> 01:12:22.513
[SPEAKER_20]: So, we'll see.

01:12:23.394 --> 01:12:23.874
[SPEAKER_20]: We will see.

01:12:24.935 --> 01:12:25.355
[SPEAKER_20]: Moving on.

01:12:26.836 --> 01:12:27.636
[SPEAKER_20]: This is big news.

01:12:27.696 --> 01:12:28.257
[SPEAKER_20]: This is huge.

01:12:28.857 --> 01:12:29.558
[SPEAKER_20]: This is huge news.

01:12:29.678 --> 01:12:30.118
[SPEAKER_20]: How huge?

01:12:30.838 --> 01:12:31.158
[SPEAKER_20]: Huge.

01:12:31.339 --> 01:12:31.899
[SPEAKER_20]: Bigger than big.

01:12:34.946 --> 01:12:36.687
[SPEAKER_20]: I was supposed to release Exceed 2, not just Exceed.

01:12:52.820 --> 01:12:53.661
[SPEAKER_20]: Well, here it is.

01:12:53.921 --> 01:12:57.526
[SPEAKER_20]: This is the press release straight from InsertCredit.com.

01:12:58.167 --> 01:13:05.918
[SPEAKER_20]: Mastiff has announced that it will be publishing Animero's Pump It Up Exceed for PlayStation 2 and Xbox in North America in June.

01:13:06.976 --> 01:13:15.481
[SPEAKER_20]: They made the announcement at the Metreon, and we had an Ace Pump It Up player named Smidget there, and they were strutting their stuff on an arcade in a home version of the Dance Mat game.

01:13:15.902 --> 01:13:24.447
[SPEAKER_20]: The Pump It Up franchise, according to this press release, has sold over a quarter million copies of the arcade versions and PC versions thus far.

01:13:25.336 --> 01:13:26.917
[SPEAKER_20]: Now you'll notice they don't say what country.

01:13:27.817 --> 01:13:31.079
[SPEAKER_26]: I know, but I already know what countries have been selling Pump It Up pretty well.

01:13:31.599 --> 01:13:36.042
[SPEAKER_20]: I imagine the PC version isn't doing too badly, but probably not so much in this country.

01:13:36.422 --> 01:13:40.024
[SPEAKER_20]: Although, you know, Red Octane has it in their store, and I imagine a lot of people pick it up through there.

01:13:40.044 --> 01:13:41.144
[SPEAKER_26]: Here's the thing, though.

01:13:41.565 --> 01:13:49.829
[SPEAKER_26]: Let's see, Pump It Up is more international than DDR, because I know Pump It Up is mainly supported in Mexico and mainly South America as well.

01:13:49.869 --> 01:13:50.049
[SPEAKER_20]: Right.

01:13:50.549 --> 01:13:53.571
[SPEAKER_26]: Because America, mainly DDR, overpopulated the whole...

01:13:54.457 --> 01:13:56.898
[SPEAKER_26]: You got your Pump fans, though.

01:13:56.938 --> 01:13:59.519
[SPEAKER_26]: I mean, overall, compared to other countries.

01:13:59.579 --> 01:14:01.860
[SPEAKER_26]: I know Mexico populizes Pump It Up.

01:14:03.140 --> 01:14:05.301
[SPEAKER_26]: Argentina, Chile, or anywhere in South America.

01:14:05.401 --> 01:14:06.502
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah, I've heard the same thing.

01:14:06.542 --> 01:14:12.724
[SPEAKER_20]: A lot of South American countries are really big on Pump It Up, as well as a lot of the countries in the East that aren't Japan or China.

01:14:12.804 --> 01:14:15.225
[SPEAKER_20]: A lot of those other countries... Korea.

01:14:15.245 --> 01:14:17.106
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah, definitely.

01:14:17.246 --> 01:14:20.067
[SPEAKER_26]: I'm not sure what other places support Pump It Up as well.

01:14:21.064 --> 01:14:35.034
[SPEAKER_20]: It should be noted, this is not going to be the exact same as the Korean PS2 version that was just launched, because there's going to be some exclusive songs, including a song by Stereogram called Walkie Talkie Man, and it's going to have the actual video that runs in the background.

01:14:35.074 --> 01:14:37.856
[SPEAKER_20]: For those of you guys who haven't seen it, it's like a claymation video.

01:14:37.876 --> 01:14:38.977
[SPEAKER_20]: It's kind of a rock song.

01:14:39.318 --> 01:14:40.879
[SPEAKER_20]: It's not your typical dance song.

01:14:40.939 --> 01:14:42.740
[SPEAKER_20]: It's kind of more of a rockish song.

01:14:43.060 --> 01:14:48.204
[SPEAKER_20]: But then again, a lot of the Korean songs in Pump It Up were kind of rock songs, so...

01:14:49.113 --> 01:14:49.793
[SPEAKER_20]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

01:15:19.654 --> 01:15:20.494
[SPEAKER_20]: I don't know how they do it.

01:15:20.554 --> 01:15:33.758
[SPEAKER_20]: If you could do autoplay on the middle, which wouldn't really be the game then, there's really no way to get these third-party pads to work unless the third-party pad has all the buttons, I don't know, is a nine-square pad or something.

01:15:34.298 --> 01:15:36.319
[SPEAKER_20]: The lack of a center button is really going to screw things up.

01:15:36.479 --> 01:15:37.839
[SPEAKER_20]: Loki?

01:15:37.899 --> 01:15:41.280
[SPEAKER_20]: There are the, oh, what pads are those?

01:15:41.360 --> 01:15:47.022
[SPEAKER_19]: There are the, I want to say Cobalt Flux pads do have the center button.

01:15:48.712 --> 01:15:51.294
[SPEAKER_19]: Those will be able to be used, but those are high-end ones.

01:15:52.375 --> 01:15:57.319
[SPEAKER_20]: As nice of a pad as Cobalt Flux is, how popular is it really?

01:15:57.660 --> 01:16:00.602
[SPEAKER_20]: It's not the kind of thing you walk into GameStop and purchase, right?

01:16:01.083 --> 01:16:03.946
[SPEAKER_20]: I had a hard enough time finding an Ignition 2.0 locally.

01:16:04.266 --> 01:16:10.752
[SPEAKER_20]: And even when I bought an Ignition 2.0, I spent $100 on DancePad, they were like, we've never sold one of these before.

01:16:10.812 --> 01:16:12.193
[SPEAKER_20]: You're actually going to buy this?

01:16:12.774 --> 01:16:14.075
[SPEAKER_20]: What the fuck is wrong with you?

01:16:15.458 --> 01:16:17.343
[SPEAKER_20]: And I was just kind of like, it's a good pad.

01:16:17.603 --> 01:16:20.751
[SPEAKER_20]: I don't want to spend $20 on the cheap pad that's going to break next week.

01:16:21.243 --> 01:16:22.284
[SPEAKER_20]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

01:16:46.306 --> 01:16:50.589
[SPEAKER_26]: Granted, it might be a little bit... It's really not the same dance style though.

01:16:50.849 --> 01:16:51.249
[SPEAKER_26]: It's really not.

01:17:14.003 --> 01:17:15.884
[SPEAKER_20]: I think Pump It Up is easier to freestyle to.

01:17:16.004 --> 01:17:22.988
[SPEAKER_26]: I think a lot of the songs you automatically, like your body's in a motion where you're... Yeah, because you're given a lot of room on freestyle itself in Pump It Up.

01:17:23.088 --> 01:17:25.550
[SPEAKER_20]: And like I said, it's a real different type of music too.

01:17:26.791 --> 01:17:29.052
[SPEAKER_19]: That's my problem with it, and this is the big one.

01:17:29.913 --> 01:17:33.455
[SPEAKER_19]: How the fuck are you going to be able to play those extreme and crazy songs?

01:17:34.075 --> 01:17:34.796
[SPEAKER_26]: That is true!

01:17:36.054 --> 01:17:38.356
[SPEAKER_26]: There's one song that's impossible to even beat.

01:17:38.436 --> 01:17:42.858
[SPEAKER_19]: There's where they have the four or five button mashing.

01:17:42.878 --> 01:17:46.220
[SPEAKER_19]: I mean, it's just not fun.

01:17:46.280 --> 01:17:54.666
[SPEAKER_19]: That's my main complaint about Pump It Up at the beginning is those crazy songs where you have to do knee drops and shit.

01:17:54.866 --> 01:17:55.326
[SPEAKER_19]: No thanks.

01:17:56.940 --> 01:17:59.122
[SPEAKER_20]: In The Groove is not DDR Unless it's convenient for it to be DDR

01:18:25.057 --> 01:18:29.618
[SPEAKER_20]: because whenever people bitch about a lack of DDR, then they go, oh, well, there's always In The Groove.

01:18:30.138 --> 01:18:32.439
[SPEAKER_20]: I thought you just said In The Groove wasn't DDR.

01:18:34.039 --> 01:18:35.120
[SPEAKER_20]: That's my number one complaint.

01:18:35.640 --> 01:18:36.000
[SPEAKER_26]: Same here.

01:18:36.020 --> 01:18:37.180
[SPEAKER_26]: I mean, some people are confused.

01:18:37.200 --> 01:18:38.640
[SPEAKER_26]: They're basically two different games.

01:18:38.660 --> 01:18:41.661
[SPEAKER_26]: They have different timing, different music, different options.

01:18:42.541 --> 01:18:44.522
[SPEAKER_26]: I mean, it's all different.

01:18:44.862 --> 01:18:46.302
[SPEAKER_26]: Some people say they're trying to compare.

01:18:46.322 --> 01:18:49.003
[SPEAKER_26]: It's like, ooh, In The Groove is DDR 9th mix.

01:18:50.563 --> 01:18:50.823
[SPEAKER_20]: No.

01:18:52.044 --> 01:18:53.224
[SPEAKER_20]: No, I wouldn't go that far.

01:18:54.679 --> 01:18:54.779
[SPEAKER_20]: Pump

01:19:16.718 --> 01:19:17.739
[SPEAKER_26]: Pump it up, yeah.

01:19:39.441 --> 01:19:48.024
[SPEAKER_20]: You and I, you being the Bomani addict, because you're actually taking time to tune in and listen to this show, you and I understand the differences between DDR and Pump It Up.

01:19:48.885 --> 01:19:56.368
[SPEAKER_20]: But the casual gamer, a parent who walks into a GameStop buying the stuff for their kid, are they going to really understand the difference?

01:19:56.768 --> 01:19:56.928
[SPEAKER_20]: No.

01:19:56.968 --> 01:20:01.510
[SPEAKER_20]: And the people who are supplying this, I think a lot of people are going to view it as a cheap knockoff of DDR.

01:20:02.290 --> 01:20:03.070
[SPEAKER_26]: Yeah, obviously.

01:20:03.190 --> 01:20:05.371
[SPEAKER_20]: I think that's the way the casual gamer is going to look at it.

01:20:05.751 --> 01:20:07.872
[SPEAKER_20]: Now, but here's the thing, if the price is right...

01:20:08.433 --> 01:20:09.254
[SPEAKER_20]: That could help it.

01:20:10.094 --> 01:20:12.597
[SPEAKER_20]: You know, somebody wants to get into the dance thing.

01:20:13.457 --> 01:20:19.542
[SPEAKER_26]: According to how they view, that's just like, just because Pump It has a stepping arrow does not mean it's a rip-off of DDR.

01:20:19.582 --> 01:20:28.289
[SPEAKER_26]: Look at other games like, that's just like saying, ooh, there's a lot of Mario knock-offs, or there's a lot of Doom knock-offs, and et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.

01:20:28.310 --> 01:20:29.991
[SPEAKER_26]: I can keep going on and on about that.

01:20:30.542 --> 01:20:35.086
[SPEAKER_20]: Here's the thing, again, again, you're talking about the casual gamer versus the addict, the dance game addict.

01:20:35.106 --> 01:20:38.528
[SPEAKER_20]: The casual gamer, you can see that a game is not Mario.

01:20:38.608 --> 01:20:40.430
[SPEAKER_20]: You can see that this game is not Mario.

01:20:41.050 --> 01:20:45.153
[SPEAKER_20]: But you see that this is another dance game with arrows that scroll up to the top of the screen that you hit them.

01:20:45.994 --> 01:20:47.175
[SPEAKER_20]: You and I understand the difference.

01:20:47.836 --> 01:20:48.416
[SPEAKER_20]: Most people don't.

01:20:49.682 --> 01:20:50.583
[SPEAKER_26]: Sadly, that's true.

01:20:52.064 --> 01:20:52.685
[SPEAKER_26]: Unfortunately.

01:20:52.705 --> 01:21:01.051
[SPEAKER_26]: Because so many people are so narrow-minded to judge from their first impressions without getting a chance to look deeply what the game is all about.

01:21:02.052 --> 01:21:10.259
[SPEAKER_26]: It's like, ooh, they say, ooh, Resident Evil, or anything they see is popular, they're going to buy it, regardless if the game is either good or bad.

01:21:10.499 --> 01:21:12.581
[SPEAKER_26]: You just look from their eyes.

01:21:15.742 --> 01:21:25.005
[SPEAKER_26]: I think the price has a lot to do with it.

01:21:25.785 --> 01:21:30.247
[SPEAKER_20]: I'd be very curious to know how that little Mad Catz game is selling right now.

01:21:30.287 --> 01:21:33.208
[SPEAKER_20]: That shitty little Mad Catz GameCube game, the dance game.

01:21:33.268 --> 01:21:36.029
[SPEAKER_20]: I'd be very curious to know how that's doing right now.

01:21:36.049 --> 01:21:39.670
[SPEAKER_20]: I don't think it's doing too hot, but I'd be very curious to know.

01:21:40.878 --> 01:21:43.339
[SPEAKER_26]: From my source, I think it's not doing good at all.

01:21:44.100 --> 01:21:45.620
[SPEAKER_26]: Considering that some people actually played it.

01:21:45.660 --> 01:21:48.821
[SPEAKER_26]: It just feels unnatural.

01:21:48.841 --> 01:21:52.703
[SPEAKER_20]: But again, the people that you're talking to are DDR and Bomani addicts.

01:21:52.743 --> 01:21:53.383
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm not talking about DDR.

01:21:53.403 --> 01:21:55.324
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm talking about casual gamers.

01:21:55.784 --> 01:21:57.365
[SPEAKER_26]: Not just DDR addicts and stuff.

01:21:58.325 --> 01:21:59.966
[SPEAKER_26]: Not the people we know in the community.

01:22:00.166 --> 01:22:02.007
[SPEAKER_26]: Just regular casual gamers.

01:22:02.527 --> 01:22:06.449
[SPEAKER_20]: I'd just be curious to know.

01:22:06.829 --> 01:22:07.569
[SPEAKER_20]: But that's the thing.

01:22:08.469 --> 01:22:09.590
[SPEAKER_20]: This is my other concern.

01:22:10.623 --> 01:22:14.726
[SPEAKER_20]: What if that game, heaven forbid, is somebody's first exposure to a dance game?

01:22:15.506 --> 01:22:17.067
[SPEAKER_20]: Then they'd never want to play DDR.

01:22:17.668 --> 01:22:20.730
[SPEAKER_20]: They'd be all, oh, I played one of those dancing games once, it was stupid.

01:22:23.792 --> 01:22:29.115
[SPEAKER_26]: Yeah, like I said, something that comes first will always get the fish, and people are just going to buy that.

01:22:29.495 --> 01:22:34.559
[SPEAKER_20]: I think that's where, and when a lot of folks say, I'm kind of going on a little tangent here, but I don't care.

01:22:34.599 --> 01:22:39.302
[SPEAKER_20]: When a lot of folks say, and back to the in the groove, not being DDR, again...

01:22:39.946 --> 01:22:40.446
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah, unfortunately.

01:22:40.466 --> 01:22:41.246
[SPEAKER_20]: So, something to think about.

01:23:10.883 --> 01:23:11.964
[SPEAKER_26]: That's how I view sports games.

01:23:12.004 --> 01:23:12.724
[SPEAKER_26]: Madden, Blitz...

01:23:38.339 --> 01:23:39.540
[SPEAKER_20]: They're all football games to me.

01:23:40.901 --> 01:23:42.962
[SPEAKER_20]: They're interchangeable parts to me.

01:23:43.182 --> 01:23:44.342
[SPEAKER_20]: A football game is a football game.

01:23:44.722 --> 01:23:50.785
[SPEAKER_20]: But if I were the sports guy, I would be saying, Oh, Sky, you're an ignorant motherfucker.

01:23:50.845 --> 01:23:53.006
[SPEAKER_20]: These games are all different.

01:23:53.306 --> 01:23:57.529
[SPEAKER_20]: This game's got this license, and this game you can play in the street.

01:23:58.689 --> 01:24:01.550
[SPEAKER_20]: But to me, the football games, they're all the same.

01:24:01.590 --> 01:24:02.591
[SPEAKER_20]: I played one, I played them all.

01:24:05.091 --> 01:24:06.152
[SPEAKER_26]: Okay, that's true.

01:24:06.212 --> 01:24:13.539
[SPEAKER_26]: Maybe I'm just being a little too critical with what I think about certain games, especially when I've played practically almost every game there is.

01:24:14.700 --> 01:24:18.123
[SPEAKER_26]: Mainly because I go to a friend of mine who keeps running games and I play them.

01:24:20.209 --> 01:24:22.150
[SPEAKER_20]: Alright, we're going to take a break, you guys.

01:24:22.370 --> 01:24:25.052
[SPEAKER_20]: We're going to take a break, and then when we come back, we're going to open up the Skype line.

01:24:25.452 --> 01:24:28.133
[SPEAKER_20]: We want to hear from some of you guys, some comments after this break.

01:24:28.213 --> 01:24:32.335
[SPEAKER_20]: I want to talk about Loki's little work of art he's completed this week.

01:24:32.355 --> 01:24:34.256
[SPEAKER_20]: Some of you guys have heard about this.

01:24:34.276 --> 01:24:35.057
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah, it's right there.

01:24:35.097 --> 01:24:35.477
[SPEAKER_20]: Look at that.

01:24:35.877 --> 01:24:36.477
[SPEAKER_20]: Isn't that crazy?

01:24:37.538 --> 01:24:39.839
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah, we'll talk about that when we come back from the break.

01:24:39.859 --> 01:24:40.539
[SPEAKER_20]: We're going to talk about all that.

01:24:40.559 --> 01:24:42.621
[SPEAKER_20]: We're going to open up the Skype line, and we're going to have ourselves a cage match.

01:24:42.661 --> 01:24:43.421
[SPEAKER_20]: Believe it or not...

01:24:44.291 --> 01:24:45.692
[SPEAKER_20]: We're kind of running long right now.

01:24:45.712 --> 01:24:47.832
[SPEAKER_20]: We're actually behind schedule.

01:24:47.872 --> 01:24:50.013
[SPEAKER_20]: We should have been in the cage match already, so this is going to be interesting.

01:24:50.353 --> 01:24:51.193
[SPEAKER_20]: I know, it's weird.

01:24:51.993 --> 01:24:55.294
[SPEAKER_20]: I totally thought... I was like, shit, it's going to be a short show tonight.

01:24:55.314 --> 01:24:56.395
[SPEAKER_20]: We've got nothing to talk about.

01:24:56.895 --> 01:24:59.076
[SPEAKER_20]: Luckily, there's been a lot of news that's helped us keep going.

01:24:59.716 --> 01:25:01.156
[SPEAKER_20]: We'll talk about all this stuff when we come back.

01:25:01.236 --> 01:25:05.157
[SPEAKER_20]: In this break, another type of love song for your Valentine's Day.

01:25:05.798 --> 01:25:06.278
[SPEAKER_20]: We'll be back.

01:25:08.908 --> 01:25:22.015
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, do it all night, do it with me I'll take you to heaven if you make me feel free, babe Do it tonight, do it all right Just take me and shake me till I burn up inside

01:25:52.728 --> 01:25:53.492
Thank you for watching!

01:26:33.166 --> 01:26:34.424
[SPEAKER_04]: Come on, do it with me.

01:27:12.431 --> 01:27:13.014
Thanks for watching!

01:28:47.354 --> 01:28:58.924
[SPEAKER_14]: I open my eyes and everything's still the same I turn to the guy who was dead last night I'm asking, what's your name?

01:29:34.716 --> 01:29:36.000
Thanks for watching!

01:30:20.925 --> 01:30:21.906
and many more.

01:31:13.860 --> 01:31:14.880
Thanks for watching!

01:31:40.223 --> 01:31:41.464
[SPEAKER_20]: Orange Lounge Radio.

01:31:41.804 --> 01:31:43.966
[SPEAKER_20]: We put your thing down, flip it, and reverse it.

01:31:49.689 --> 01:31:51.591
[SPEAKER_17]: You know, they played that song at the club last night, too.

01:31:52.471 --> 01:31:54.252
[SPEAKER_20]: Gotta beat, better work it.

01:31:54.473 --> 01:31:55.093
[SPEAKER_20]: I love that song.

01:31:55.333 --> 01:31:55.633
[SPEAKER_20]: Love it.

01:31:56.454 --> 01:32:02.338
[SPEAKER_20]: Anyway, in that break you heard some songs there, a different type of Valentine's Day for you.

01:32:02.778 --> 01:32:08.642
[SPEAKER_20]: Do It All Night, Injection of Love, So Many Men, and Jack and Mark Get Busy.

01:32:09.178 --> 01:32:09.478
[SPEAKER_20]: Get it?

01:32:09.798 --> 01:32:10.299
[SPEAKER_20]: Jack and Mark?

01:32:10.319 --> 01:32:10.939
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah, alright.

01:32:12.000 --> 01:32:16.883
[SPEAKER_20]: Even though the song really has nothing... Anyway, I just think it's got a funny title.

01:32:17.383 --> 01:32:25.848
[SPEAKER_20]: I couldn't think of a fourth song that was kind of... Without doing like a four song erotic break, trying to mix up the artists a little bit, I couldn't think of a fourth song.

01:32:26.589 --> 01:32:31.072
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm sure now they'll be yelling ideas in the chat room, so we'll see.

01:32:31.092 --> 01:32:31.532
[SPEAKER_20]: Anyway.

01:32:31.552 --> 01:32:31.772
[SPEAKER_20]: Anyway.

01:32:32.771 --> 01:32:34.592
[SPEAKER_20]: We are going to open up the Skype line in a little bit.

01:32:34.612 --> 01:32:41.335
[SPEAKER_20]: If you're trying to call in right now, we're not going to take your call just yet because we want to give folks a chance to fire up the Skype line and call in.

01:32:42.175 --> 01:32:43.636
[SPEAKER_20]: www.orangeonradio.com.

01:32:43.656 --> 01:32:45.877
[SPEAKER_20]: Click on Interact With Us if you want more information.

01:32:45.917 --> 01:32:49.138
[SPEAKER_20]: Before we do that, though, I want to talk about Loki's little project.

01:32:49.983 --> 01:32:58.909
[SPEAKER_20]: Loki's been working on this project for several weeks now, and this is exciting to me, because he has actually finished this project.

01:32:59.009 --> 01:33:02.111
[SPEAKER_20]: And I've known Loki a while now, and he never finishes his projects.

01:33:02.632 --> 01:33:05.193
[SPEAKER_20]: This is like the first project I've seen him actually finish.

01:33:05.233 --> 01:33:06.814
[SPEAKER_20]: So, Loki, set it up for us.

01:33:07.555 --> 01:33:10.757
[SPEAKER_20]: What is this you're doing, and why did you... Angel, if you'd be so kind.

01:33:12.538 --> 01:33:14.940
[SPEAKER_20]: What is this you're doing, and why?

01:33:14.960 --> 01:33:15.040
[SPEAKER_20]: Okay.

01:33:16.443 --> 01:33:20.484
[SPEAKER_19]: I basically made a portable computer that's inside of an Xbox.

01:33:21.605 --> 01:33:21.965
[SPEAKER_19]: Why?

01:33:22.545 --> 01:33:23.025
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't know.

01:33:23.165 --> 01:33:26.926
[SPEAKER_19]: I could have simply bought a laptop for the amount of money they spent building this damn thing.

01:33:27.046 --> 01:33:30.688
[SPEAKER_20]: By the way, screen caps on orangeonsradio.com right now if you want to save them.

01:33:30.728 --> 01:33:31.588
[SPEAKER_20]: That would be lovely.

01:33:31.748 --> 01:33:32.948
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm sure we'd appreciate that.

01:33:33.869 --> 01:33:35.369
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah, because I need, you know.

01:33:35.869 --> 01:33:38.370
[SPEAKER_19]: Anyways, there it is.

01:33:38.790 --> 01:33:39.710
[SPEAKER_19]: It's on the webcam.

01:33:41.191 --> 01:33:41.811
[SPEAKER_19]: The orange box.

01:33:42.554 --> 01:33:43.254
[SPEAKER_19]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

01:34:13.957 --> 01:34:15.938
[SPEAKER_19]: It's got Windows XP on it right now.

01:34:16.878 --> 01:34:21.719
[SPEAKER_19]: I have built a portable monitor to go with it, which is on the webcam right now.

01:34:22.179 --> 01:34:30.841
[SPEAKER_19]: It's actually inside of a metal CD case, and it runs off of batteries if it needs to be, which in this case it is running off of battery power right now.

01:34:31.701 --> 01:34:35.022
[SPEAKER_19]: Normally the PC itself actually does have a battery, however...

01:34:36.028 --> 01:34:40.311
[SPEAKER_19]: As of charging it up today, it looks like the battery is defective or something.

01:34:40.331 --> 01:34:43.713
[SPEAKER_19]: It only charged about 75% of the way before it said it was full.

01:34:44.473 --> 01:34:47.355
[SPEAKER_19]: And it's not, so I have to send that back.

01:34:47.395 --> 01:34:48.536
[SPEAKER_19]: So that kind of sucks.

01:34:50.077 --> 01:34:52.738
[SPEAKER_19]: Everything looks really sweet.

01:34:52.818 --> 01:34:54.960
[SPEAKER_19]: I wish I could open the case up for you guys to see.

01:34:55.040 --> 01:35:00.023
[SPEAKER_19]: It's got a UV fan on the top of it, kind of like a blower.

01:35:01.383 --> 01:35:06.285
[SPEAKER_19]: And so basically the whole thing is just, you know, self-contained in this Xbox case right now.

01:35:06.986 --> 01:35:07.466
[SPEAKER_19]: Pretty sweet.

01:35:07.486 --> 01:35:20.632
[SPEAKER_19]: It's kind of slow because Micro-ITX PCs are only, they have the processor built into the actual motherboard, and it's only 1 gigahertz, so we're talking a little slow, but...

01:35:21.584 --> 01:35:23.725
[SPEAKER_20]: You know, hey, for a portable PC, it's not bad.

01:35:24.586 --> 01:35:28.248
[SPEAKER_20]: I think it's interesting that the monitor is just one of those PS1 screens.

01:35:29.549 --> 01:35:31.150
[SPEAKER_20]: It's crazy.

01:35:31.971 --> 01:35:33.552
[SPEAKER_20]: How can you see things on that?

01:35:34.332 --> 01:35:35.293
[SPEAKER_20]: Very carefully.

01:35:35.653 --> 01:35:37.374
[SPEAKER_20]: Literally, it's a five-inch monitor.

01:35:38.041 --> 01:35:43.724
[SPEAKER_20]: And as if those 15-inch screens weren't bad enough, you are doing computing work on a 5-inch monitor.

01:35:43.965 --> 01:35:51.869
[SPEAKER_19]: Well, I have a shortcut on the desktop for the magnifier in case I can't read something.

01:35:52.489 --> 01:35:57.512
[SPEAKER_19]: Because it does get tough, especially when I set up the graphics and stuff.

01:35:57.612 --> 01:36:04.596
[SPEAKER_19]: I have the resolution set really low so I can actually be able to do stuff with it.

01:36:06.462 --> 01:36:10.785
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah, it's a lovely shot of our floor there on the webcam right now in the massive DVD collection there.

01:36:14.208 --> 01:36:17.750
[SPEAKER_19]: And so, yeah, the lowest I could go... I'm sorry, what do you want?

01:36:18.010 --> 01:36:19.411
[SPEAKER_25]: What's the resolution by 320x240?

01:36:19.852 --> 01:36:22.293
[SPEAKER_25]: I don't think you can go that low, can you?

01:36:23.334 --> 01:36:25.696
[SPEAKER_26]: Is it the PS screen?

01:36:25.716 --> 01:36:33.661
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm not sure if it can go by... No, it's really actually, to be honest, because I have it 640x480 and I adjusted all the fonts so they're huge.

01:36:34.422 --> 01:36:34.482
[SPEAKER_19]: Um...

01:36:35.040 --> 01:36:36.721
[SPEAKER_19]: I can actually read it pretty well.

01:36:36.941 --> 01:36:43.606
[SPEAKER_19]: I mean, the icon, you know, the icons, you can read what they say on it and everything.

01:36:44.947 --> 01:36:46.468
[SPEAKER_19]: It's not that hard to read.

01:36:46.628 --> 01:36:54.814
[SPEAKER_19]: And like I said, I have the magnifier, you know, macro, or not really macro, but a shortcut to the magnifier.

01:36:54.974 --> 01:36:59.077
[SPEAKER_19]: And if I can't read anything, you just move it over there and you can actually read it.

01:36:59.117 --> 01:37:03.600
[SPEAKER_19]: There's a little window at the top that magnifies everything really big so you can actually see it.

01:37:04.096 --> 01:37:11.042
[SPEAKER_19]: But this monitor, I mean, not only will it output, it'll output to anything that takes the TV out, you know, or TV in.

01:37:11.182 --> 01:37:16.306
[SPEAKER_19]: So I can hook this up to the TV and that's, you know, you won't have any problem seeing the picture.

01:37:16.807 --> 01:37:22.371
[SPEAKER_19]: This is just for, you know, to make it sure portable, which I hope to take it with me to E3.

01:37:24.333 --> 01:37:26.615
[SPEAKER_19]: That was the whole purpose of building it in the first place.

01:37:27.475 --> 01:37:28.156
[SPEAKER_19]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

01:37:43.535 --> 01:37:47.176
[SPEAKER_19]: And the Xbox being the largest console system that I can think of.

01:37:48.416 --> 01:37:49.536
[SPEAKER_20]: Well, you know what's funny?

01:37:50.297 --> 01:37:53.397
[SPEAKER_20]: Have you shown an above shot of it where they can see the fan?

01:37:53.737 --> 01:37:59.999
[SPEAKER_20]: Because it's so funny because you actually drilled out that little Xbox logo that's in the center of an Xbox, and that's where you put the fan.

01:38:00.439 --> 01:38:02.059
[SPEAKER_20]: And I find that so hilarious.

01:38:02.099 --> 01:38:02.579
[SPEAKER_20]: I don't know why.

01:38:02.639 --> 01:38:03.979
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm so easily amused by that.

01:38:04.339 --> 01:38:06.720
[SPEAKER_20]: But the way you laid everything out is so funny.

01:38:07.280 --> 01:38:08.000
[SPEAKER_20]: Plus, I think it's funny.

01:38:08.040 --> 01:38:10.501
[SPEAKER_20]: You were telling me about how you were holding some of the stuff in.

01:38:10.861 --> 01:38:11.161
[SPEAKER_20]: You were...

01:38:12.430 --> 01:38:20.957
[SPEAKER_20]: Literally parts of this computer are being held together by duct tape and zip ties.

01:38:20.977 --> 01:38:21.817
[SPEAKER_19]: No, not duct tape.

01:38:22.558 --> 01:38:23.799
[SPEAKER_19]: Zip ties for the most part.

01:38:24.239 --> 01:38:32.446
[SPEAKER_19]: The hard drive is being held in by zip ties because the way it had to be mounted, I couldn't mount it on the bottom because I didn't have the right screws for it.

01:38:32.926 --> 01:38:36.188
[SPEAKER_19]: So I actually mounted it with zip ties and that sucker ain't moving.

01:38:36.208 --> 01:38:36.709
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay.

01:38:37.403 --> 01:38:38.643
[SPEAKER_19]: CD-ROM CD Burner

01:38:57.710 --> 01:38:58.491
[SPEAKER_20]: You actually have a drive?

01:38:58.551 --> 01:39:00.373
[SPEAKER_20]: I didn't realize you had a drive in there.

01:39:00.453 --> 01:39:01.674
[SPEAKER_20]: Where the hell did you fit that?

01:39:01.854 --> 01:39:03.115
[SPEAKER_19]: There's a CD burner in there.

01:39:03.135 --> 01:39:09.059
[SPEAKER_19]: It actually fits in there right where the normal drive would be.

01:39:09.079 --> 01:39:09.880
[SPEAKER_19]: That is crazy.

01:39:09.900 --> 01:39:14.664
[SPEAKER_19]: The only problem is lately it's been sticking, so I've got to figure out why that is.

01:39:15.124 --> 01:39:18.286
[SPEAKER_19]: But that barely fit in there with the fan in there.

01:39:18.807 --> 01:39:20.788
[SPEAKER_20]: It's literally pressed up right against the fan.

01:39:21.849 --> 01:39:25.332
[SPEAKER_20]: Dark Knight says if Bill Gates were to see that, Loki would be so toast right now.

01:39:26.488 --> 01:39:28.169
[SPEAKER_19]: It's running Microsoft Windows.

01:39:31.431 --> 01:39:32.911
[SPEAKER_19]: It's not like I put Linux in it.

01:39:33.071 --> 01:39:34.392
[SPEAKER_20]: Can you install Linux on it?

01:39:34.412 --> 01:39:36.713
[SPEAKER_20]: Because God knows they'll install Linux on anything they can.

01:39:38.894 --> 01:39:40.555
[SPEAKER_20]: I think it's quite a little complicated.

01:39:40.715 --> 01:39:44.377
[SPEAKER_20]: But you didn't go out and buy an Xbox and gut it.

01:39:44.477 --> 01:39:46.258
[SPEAKER_19]: No, I bought a case online.

01:39:46.358 --> 01:39:46.798
[SPEAKER_20]: On eBay.

01:39:47.519 --> 01:39:48.019
[SPEAKER_19]: Not on eBay.

01:39:48.059 --> 01:39:53.762
[SPEAKER_19]: There's an actual website that they sell case mods and stuff so you can buy clear cases.

01:39:53.782 --> 01:39:54.862
[SPEAKER_19]: I should have bought a clear case.

01:39:54.882 --> 01:39:55.583
[SPEAKER_19]: That would have been cool.

01:39:55.603 --> 01:39:56.243
[SPEAKER_19]: But they were like,

01:39:56.678 --> 01:40:04.421
[SPEAKER_19]: I bought a case and everything is mounted on my own.

01:40:04.461 --> 01:40:09.884
[SPEAKER_19]: I had to make and drill mounts for the motherboard.

01:40:10.004 --> 01:40:11.985
[SPEAKER_19]: I had to dremel the hell out of this.

01:40:12.605 --> 01:40:19.428
[SPEAKER_19]: I want to move it so I can show the other side here, but I'm afraid I'm going to knock the power thing out again.

01:40:21.243 --> 01:40:49.092
[SPEAKER_19]: but anyways, yeah, um, unlike most PCs where you have all your ports on the back of the PC this has all the ports on the side of the Xbox, so it would be on the left hand side, um, and I unfortunately cannot reach the camera over there to see that, but trust me, they're there um, and then the power's in the back, the power right now was being held on by hot glue, however that fell off, so it's being held on by uh, um wire right now, that's

01:40:49.622 --> 01:40:52.343
[SPEAKER_19]: Just temporary until I get some super glue to put that on there.

01:40:52.463 --> 01:40:58.026
[SPEAKER_20]: No, I thought the original idea for this is that it was going to be something you were going to have in a backpack or something and carry around with you.

01:40:58.166 --> 01:41:01.128
[SPEAKER_19]: I guess that idea is kind of out the window at this point.

01:41:01.248 --> 01:41:01.928
[SPEAKER_19]: What the hell?

01:41:02.689 --> 01:41:07.651
[SPEAKER_19]: To buy stuff to make your own wearable PC is way too expensive.

01:41:07.731 --> 01:41:13.094
[SPEAKER_20]: I was just thinking, my God, with a fan on the top like that, that's kind of dangerous in a way, if you're not careful.

01:41:13.254 --> 01:41:17.156
[SPEAKER_19]: Well, I'm going to have a grill over it, so that's not going to be a problem.

01:41:17.536 --> 01:41:19.437
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, right now, though, it doesn't have a grill over it.

01:41:19.741 --> 01:41:31.985
[SPEAKER_19]: That's the cool thing about this, though, is with the fan being right over... Where the fan is located is right on top of the RAM and the North and South Bridge on the motherboard.

01:41:32.025 --> 01:41:35.866
[SPEAKER_19]: You know, the two main chips that they have on there to do all the processing.

01:41:36.286 --> 01:41:40.147
[SPEAKER_19]: And then slightly diagonal of that is the processor.

01:41:40.848 --> 01:41:45.229
[SPEAKER_19]: So all of the heat that's generated off that is just shot out of the top like nothing.

01:41:45.809 --> 01:41:48.130
[SPEAKER_19]: So this PC will not overheat at all.

01:41:49.301 --> 01:41:49.981
[SPEAKER_19]: XBOX BOOT UP SCREEN

01:42:14.540 --> 01:42:15.360
[SPEAKER_19]: That is the background.

01:42:16.281 --> 01:42:18.682
[SPEAKER_19]: I can't get a very good shot of the picture right now.

01:42:20.143 --> 01:42:23.965
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, it says... Maybe I'll see if we can get in here.

01:42:24.785 --> 01:42:27.787
[SPEAKER_19]: Well, anyways, it says the Orange Box PC created by Loki.

01:42:27.887 --> 01:42:30.548
[SPEAKER_19]: I'll post the pictures of that screen later.

01:42:31.269 --> 01:42:36.551
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, it is the actual screen there, and I have the theme kind of going with it.

01:42:36.972 --> 01:42:39.473
[SPEAKER_19]: This case that's in right now, actually...

01:42:40.277 --> 01:42:41.998
[SPEAKER_19]: I'll probably just unplug this real quick.

01:42:42.018 --> 01:42:43.539
[SPEAKER_20]: Are there a lot of people out there that have done this?

01:42:43.699 --> 01:42:45.740
[SPEAKER_20]: Turned their Xboxes and gutted them and done PCs?

01:42:46.060 --> 01:42:48.081
[SPEAKER_19]: There's a few people that have.

01:42:49.162 --> 01:42:55.045
[SPEAKER_19]: I've seen one that they've actually shoved a GameCube inside of an Xbox as well as an Xbox.

01:42:55.546 --> 01:42:56.326
[SPEAKER_21]: Interesting.

01:42:56.366 --> 01:43:02.830
[SPEAKER_19]: Then I've seen people that have actually taken the whole Xbox stuff out, put it in a PC case with a PlayStation 2 and...

01:43:05.339 --> 01:43:11.682
[SPEAKER_19]: and also pretty much all the game systems all in one, which is kind of retarded, but whatever.

01:43:12.643 --> 01:43:20.927
[SPEAKER_19]: But yeah, and I've got to paint the case still for the modern orange as well to match the rest, but that's optional, of course.

01:43:22.028 --> 01:43:22.548
[SPEAKER_20]: Interesting.

01:43:22.668 --> 01:43:23.749
[SPEAKER_20]: All right, well, thanks for sharing.

01:43:23.809 --> 01:43:29.472
[SPEAKER_20]: Maybe we can get some clearer pics and put them up on our website because we don't really use our... I can use the cam page for anything.

01:43:30.152 --> 01:43:30.813
[SPEAKER_19]: We'll figure something out.

01:43:30.833 --> 01:43:31.553
[SPEAKER_20]: All right, we'll figure something out.

01:43:31.949 --> 01:43:35.852
[SPEAKER_20]: Anyway, we are going to open up the Skype line for some feedback if you guys want to call in.

01:43:35.872 --> 01:43:39.074
[SPEAKER_20]: If you want to talk about the Xbox PC, if you have any questions for Loki on that.

01:43:39.535 --> 01:43:45.279
[SPEAKER_20]: Or, of course, we're willing to talk to you guys for a little bit about the Pump It Up news, about the DDR news, all that stuff.

01:43:46.079 --> 01:43:49.001
[SPEAKER_20]: Call in right now, www.orangeloungeradio.com.

01:43:49.341 --> 01:43:53.985
[SPEAKER_20]: Click on the Interact With Us link for more information about how to get a hold of us through the Skype line.

01:43:54.465 --> 01:43:59.809
[SPEAKER_20]: Meanwhile, while we wait for that, because it takes a minute for the buffer to hit, let's say hello to Bugged, who just joined us in the studio.

01:44:00.543 --> 01:44:02.164
[SPEAKER_02]: Hello to Bugged, who just joined us in the studio.

01:44:02.224 --> 01:44:02.864
[SPEAKER_20]: How you doing, sir?

01:44:02.884 --> 01:44:04.365
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, naked hot tubbing, actually.

01:44:05.386 --> 01:44:05.606
[SPEAKER_02]: What?

01:44:06.046 --> 01:44:06.766
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that was yesterday.

01:44:07.407 --> 01:44:09.007
[SPEAKER_02]: Every night in San Jose, I did some naked hot tubbing.

01:44:12.509 --> 01:44:13.730
[SPEAKER_02]: Close your mouth or you're tracking flies.

01:44:13.750 --> 01:44:14.010
[SPEAKER_02]: Wait.

01:44:15.010 --> 01:44:15.971
[SPEAKER_20]: Run that by me again.

01:44:16.051 --> 01:44:16.471
[SPEAKER_20]: Why?

01:44:16.871 --> 01:44:17.432
[SPEAKER_20]: Why the hell not?

01:44:19.793 --> 01:44:20.333
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay, whatever.

01:44:20.613 --> 01:44:21.274
[SPEAKER_02]: There was a hot tub?

01:44:22.654 --> 01:44:22.995
[SPEAKER_20]: I don't know.

01:44:23.115 --> 01:44:24.015
[SPEAKER_20]: I don't know how to follow that up.

01:44:24.035 --> 01:44:24.615
[SPEAKER_20]: All right, let's go.

01:44:24.956 --> 01:44:26.516
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank God we have somebody on the Skype line.

01:44:26.556 --> 01:44:27.557
[SPEAKER_20]: Hi, you're on Orange Sounds Radio.

01:44:29.704 --> 01:44:34.867
[SPEAKER_20]: Legend of Zaku here Hello, Legend of Zaku, you're a little bit choppy tonight, what's up?

01:44:38.529 --> 01:44:52.517
[SPEAKER_12]: Let me see, yeah, the choppiness of my school's connection, IRC basically kicking me out You know, basically dying on me a few times, that's why they used a new program for IRC now Well, life sucks, what's on your mind?

01:44:54.731 --> 01:44:55.291
[SPEAKER_12]: Let me see.

01:44:56.292 --> 01:45:02.955
[SPEAKER_12]: All this jive about people just, you know, being so pessimistic about, you know, can I make another mix, another arcade mix?

01:45:03.015 --> 01:45:06.136
[SPEAKER_12]: That's just really, I don't know, that's kind of getting to me personally.

01:45:07.817 --> 01:45:12.259
[SPEAKER_20]: You're just upset that people are pretty much writing it off and people are saying it's never going to happen?

01:45:12.839 --> 01:45:14.000
[SPEAKER_12]: They're doubters.

01:45:14.060 --> 01:45:17.181
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, they're basically pessimistic as we speak.

01:45:17.201 --> 01:45:20.582
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm not saying any names, but that's the mood I'm sensing right now.

01:45:20.943 --> 01:45:21.323
[SPEAKER_12]: Well...

01:45:22.645 --> 01:45:28.027
[SPEAKER_20]: You can't say that there's for sure never going to be another Konami arcade mix because there is one coming out in Europe.

01:45:28.087 --> 01:45:28.728
[SPEAKER_20]: We know that much.

01:45:28.928 --> 01:45:29.708
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

01:45:30.308 --> 01:45:37.051
[SPEAKER_12]: If it does good, then Konami can rethink their plans of bringing it stateside.

01:45:37.312 --> 01:45:40.773
[SPEAKER_20]: Is it possible there will be a new arcade mix?

01:45:40.933 --> 01:45:41.614
[SPEAKER_20]: I say yes.

01:45:42.134 --> 01:45:42.394
[SPEAKER_20]: But...

01:45:43.167 --> 01:45:46.133
[SPEAKER_20]: I don't think we really know at this point what's going to happen.

01:45:46.153 --> 01:45:51.222
[SPEAKER_20]: If it's going to happen tomorrow, if it's going to happen in the next couple of years, or what.

01:45:51.242 --> 01:45:52.985
[SPEAKER_02]: Is this a life-turning event for you?

01:45:53.967 --> 01:45:54.188
[SPEAKER_02]: Well...

01:45:55.109 --> 01:46:08.215
[SPEAKER_20]: No, but at the same time, it's kind of sad that DDR introduced me to all these people and gave me an idea for a radio show that we've been doing for the past few years and everything.

01:46:08.695 --> 01:46:13.697
[SPEAKER_20]: It's just kind of sad that DDR helped with all that and now the game is not happening.

01:46:14.117 --> 01:46:16.118
[SPEAKER_20]: And that's why people are so passionate about it.

01:46:16.158 --> 01:46:19.400
[SPEAKER_12]: Because people have been sucking down on Xtreme for about two years now.

01:46:20.363 --> 01:46:31.087
[SPEAKER_20]: I agree that the longer it goes on, the more that the other games, like In the Groove and Pump It Up, are going to catch on.

01:46:31.187 --> 01:46:33.787
[SPEAKER_12]: So I agree that Konami is shooting themselves in the foot, but what can you do?

01:46:33.807 --> 01:46:36.028
[SPEAKER_12]: What the hell?

01:46:36.488 --> 01:46:36.888
[SPEAKER_21]: What the hell?

01:46:41.880 --> 01:46:44.583
[SPEAKER_20]: I don't know what that noise was either, but that's right.

01:46:45.644 --> 01:46:59.158
[SPEAKER_20]: Well, you know, as far as the petitions and things go, that's all nice and dandy, but I think it really sits in Konami of Japan's court, and we're all basically their bitches right now until they make a decision.

01:47:01.536 --> 01:47:04.158
[SPEAKER_12]: Don't we have advocates such as Jason Enos?

01:47:04.859 --> 01:47:05.900
[SPEAKER_12]: Don't we got these people?

01:47:05.980 --> 01:47:07.141
[SPEAKER_20]: They're fabulous more.

01:47:21.454 --> 01:47:21.994
[SPEAKER_20]: Fabulous!

01:47:22.554 --> 01:47:35.717
[SPEAKER_20]: DDR Extreme, despite all the crap... Well, despite all the crap DDR Extreme got from some people, they tried something different, they tried a lot of new things, and for the most part, it was pretty cool.

01:47:35.857 --> 01:47:38.037
[SPEAKER_20]: And for the casual player, it was very cool.

01:47:38.457 --> 01:47:42.638
[SPEAKER_20]: So, as far as DDR Home stuff in America, they're really not doing anything wrong.

01:47:42.838 --> 01:47:43.738
[SPEAKER_20]: They're doing everything right.

01:47:44.338 --> 01:47:45.658
[SPEAKER_20]: So, you can't fault them.

01:47:46.579 --> 01:47:47.519
[SPEAKER_20]: So, I don't know.

01:47:47.959 --> 01:47:48.259
[SPEAKER_12]: I know.

01:47:50.383 --> 01:47:53.786
[SPEAKER_12]: I know, I can't, I know, I can accept that, but, you know, come on now.

01:47:53.946 --> 01:47:59.010
[SPEAKER_12]: Two years without a mix, that's just, you know, there has to be something done.

01:47:59.791 --> 01:48:00.151
[SPEAKER_12]: Anything.

01:48:00.231 --> 01:48:05.095
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't care if you just make at least a faint, you know, action of just starting to make one.

01:48:05.575 --> 01:48:10.197
[SPEAKER_12]: I would care as long as I know that you guys are thinking, as long as I know that Konami's thinking of something.

01:48:10.397 --> 01:48:13.498
[SPEAKER_20]: Well, hopefully they'll give us a clue at some point.

01:48:13.538 --> 01:48:19.139
[SPEAKER_20]: But anyway, Zach, we're going to let you go because there's a bunch of people trying to get in and you're kind of fading out anyway, so I've got to let you go, buddy.

01:48:19.179 --> 01:48:19.760
[SPEAKER_20]: But have a good one.

01:48:19.800 --> 01:48:20.400
[SPEAKER_20]: Thanks for calling.

01:48:20.780 --> 01:48:21.060
[SPEAKER_20]: Later.

01:48:22.481 --> 01:48:24.001
[SPEAKER_20]: All right, let's pick up this one.

01:48:24.901 --> 01:48:25.942
[SPEAKER_20]: Hi, you're on Orange Lawns Radio.

01:48:27.002 --> 01:48:28.462
[SPEAKER_32]: Hey, Sky, it's Al Mullet again.

01:48:28.603 --> 01:48:29.403
[SPEAKER_32]: Hello, Al Mullet.

01:48:29.423 --> 01:48:29.903
[SPEAKER_32]: What's on your mind?

01:48:31.209 --> 01:48:35.512
[SPEAKER_32]: Well, basically, Legend of Zaku was talking about how he wasn't going to name names.

01:48:35.552 --> 01:48:37.193
[SPEAKER_32]: Well, that was the other half of that argument.

01:48:37.293 --> 01:48:38.334
[SPEAKER_20]: Okay, all right.

01:48:38.374 --> 01:48:40.195
[SPEAKER_20]: So you want to give us the other half of the story here, then?

01:48:40.796 --> 01:48:53.884
[SPEAKER_32]: Well, basically, all my other half was is that I'm sure Konami would love to release another arcade mix here in the States, but then again, they're going to have to look at how profitable is it going to be for them at this point in time.

01:48:56.686 --> 01:48:56.706
[SPEAKER_20]: I...

01:48:58.343 --> 01:49:01.725
[SPEAKER_20]: I would think it's profitable, personally, but I don't know.

01:49:01.825 --> 01:49:06.607
[SPEAKER_20]: I mean, I don't have... I have a skewed perspective, and I think we all do as DDR addicts.

01:49:06.667 --> 01:49:10.349
[SPEAKER_20]: We think our game is perfect and it's making Konami tons of money, and we don't really know.

01:49:11.010 --> 01:49:23.336
[SPEAKER_20]: But when I see the imitators doing well, such as Pump It Up is doing so well that now they're going to do a home release, it kind of makes me go, hmm, if the imitators are doing well...

01:49:25.569 --> 01:49:36.276
[SPEAKER_20]: That's true, but now that the imitators are moving to the home markets, I'm hoping that this news about Puppet Up being released on a console in the US is a huge wake-up call.

01:49:36.596 --> 01:49:45.662
[SPEAKER_20]: But then again, the US console scene is not where Konami needs a wake-up call, because as I said in the last call, they're doing everything right, as far as I'm concerned.

01:49:46.483 --> 01:49:47.504
[SPEAKER_32]: That's true, that's true.

01:49:47.884 --> 01:49:49.405
[SPEAKER_20]: They're not the ones that need the wake-up call.

01:49:49.465 --> 01:49:51.066
[SPEAKER_20]: They should go out and release this in Japan.

01:49:52.569 --> 01:49:58.393
[SPEAKER_20]: Right, I mean, the one thing that really... Which I guess they've done already, but who knows.

01:49:58.433 --> 01:50:03.196
[SPEAKER_32]: The one thing that really gets me is that people are bitching and moaning, the U.S.

01:50:03.236 --> 01:50:06.898
[SPEAKER_32]: needs a new arcade mix when there hasn't been a new U.S.

01:50:07.038 --> 01:50:08.559
[SPEAKER_32]: arcade mix in years.

01:50:09.700 --> 01:50:16.824
[SPEAKER_20]: Well, that's a very good point, is people often confuse these Japanese releases that get imported as U.S.

01:50:17.184 --> 01:50:18.085
[SPEAKER_20]: releases, but...

01:50:18.935 --> 01:50:24.576
[SPEAKER_32]: Not only that, but we kind of shot our own selves in the foot as far as US arcade games go.

01:50:25.096 --> 01:50:33.938
[SPEAKER_32]: Because when DDRUSA was released, the arcade version, it seemed more people wanted to play the imports.

01:50:33.958 --> 01:50:36.899
[SPEAKER_32]: They wanted to play the ones with the 50, the 80, the 100 song lists.

01:50:36.959 --> 01:50:40.400
[SPEAKER_20]: Well, because DDRUSA, for the most part, was crap.

01:50:40.440 --> 01:50:43.601
[SPEAKER_20]: And so was the first home release, when you put it side by side with the import.

01:50:43.641 --> 01:50:45.161
[SPEAKER_20]: But now, I trust...

01:50:46.038 --> 01:50:49.199
[SPEAKER_20]: Canami of America way more now than I would have back then.

01:50:49.920 --> 01:50:54.142
[SPEAKER_20]: Because I would think that if they put out an arcade, like I said, I said this when Ultra Mix 2 first came out.

01:50:54.622 --> 01:50:56.883
[SPEAKER_20]: Make Canami of Hawaii do the next arcade mix.

01:50:57.303 --> 01:50:58.604
[SPEAKER_20]: We'll all want to have sex with it.

01:50:58.704 --> 01:50:59.364
[SPEAKER_20]: It'll be beautiful.

01:51:01.945 --> 01:51:03.366
[SPEAKER_20]: Hook up with a different drum again.

01:51:04.166 --> 01:51:05.047
[SPEAKER_20]: It'll be a beautiful mix.

01:51:05.914 --> 01:51:06.775
[SPEAKER_20]: Nobody's going to complain.

01:51:07.055 --> 01:51:09.758
[SPEAKER_32]: I agree 100% with you there, Sky.

01:51:09.798 --> 01:51:16.185
[SPEAKER_32]: Anyway, moving off of this subject, the reason why I wanted to call was because of the new P.I.U.

01:51:16.305 --> 01:51:17.306
[SPEAKER_32]: North American release.

01:51:18.026 --> 01:51:20.449
[SPEAKER_20]: Sometimes I just like to take the I out and call it P.U.,

01:51:22.142 --> 01:51:22.623
[SPEAKER_21]: I just got here.

01:51:22.703 --> 01:51:23.083
[SPEAKER_20]: I just got here.

01:51:23.103 --> 01:51:23.944
[SPEAKER_20]: There's been no comedy.

01:51:23.964 --> 01:51:25.025
[SPEAKER_21]: There's a song list for the U.S.

01:51:25.045 --> 01:51:25.465
[SPEAKER_21]: one out?

01:51:49.608 --> 01:51:57.550
[SPEAKER_32]: Yeah, if you check down in the DDR Freak thread, if you check down like very low in the second post, they've already released a song list.

01:51:58.110 --> 01:52:05.052
[SPEAKER_32]: It's going to be very heavily influenced by the Korean version, the Korean home version.

01:52:05.772 --> 01:52:12.994
[SPEAKER_32]: It's going to be 85 songs, tons of banya, there's going to be tons of K-pop.

01:52:13.194 --> 01:52:14.575
[SPEAKER_20]: Surprise, tons of banya.

01:52:15.115 --> 01:52:15.875
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah, obviously.

01:52:16.670 --> 01:52:18.351
[SPEAKER_32]: But there's going to be lots of K-pop.

01:52:19.693 --> 01:52:23.015
[SPEAKER_32]: You've heard that there's going to be some exclusive American content.

01:52:24.617 --> 01:52:28.720
[SPEAKER_32]: The K-pop dwarfs that by like five or six times.

01:52:28.940 --> 01:52:29.741
[SPEAKER_20]: Interesting.

01:52:30.462 --> 01:52:34.085
[SPEAKER_20]: Are you saying the song list is on page two of that thread, is what you said?

01:52:34.405 --> 01:52:34.865
[SPEAKER_20]: Page two.

01:52:34.985 --> 01:52:35.546
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, there it is.

01:52:36.247 --> 01:52:36.547
[SPEAKER_20]: I see it.

01:52:36.607 --> 01:52:37.147
[SPEAKER_20]: Okay, never mind.

01:52:37.187 --> 01:52:37.528
[SPEAKER_20]: I got it.

01:52:37.588 --> 01:52:37.888
[SPEAKER_20]: I see it.

01:52:38.268 --> 01:52:39.409
[SPEAKER_20]: Ooh, we get Starion.

01:52:39.449 --> 01:52:39.990
[SPEAKER_20]: That's hot.

01:52:40.410 --> 01:52:41.171
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah, definitely.

01:52:41.191 --> 01:52:42.252
[SPEAKER_26]: That's an obvious one.

01:52:42.512 --> 01:52:43.773
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah, I know, but that song's so hot.

01:52:43.813 --> 01:52:43.953
[SPEAKER_20]: NXT 2.

01:52:47.759 --> 01:52:49.360
[SPEAKER_20]: Crystal Method, Name of the Game.

01:52:50.000 --> 01:52:55.282
[SPEAKER_20]: Wasn't somebody, somebody was saying that that song needed to be in a dance game for like the longest time.

01:52:55.422 --> 01:52:56.242
[SPEAKER_20]: Was it you, Lanky?

01:52:56.882 --> 01:52:59.983
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm thinking Lanky Style said it, but maybe it was you, Loki.

01:53:00.083 --> 01:53:00.443
[SPEAKER_20]: I don't know.

01:53:01.004 --> 01:53:01.524
[SPEAKER_20]: That's hot.

01:53:02.224 --> 01:53:05.505
[SPEAKER_20]: Elvis, Little Less Conversation, which is funny, that's a DDR song.

01:53:05.885 --> 01:53:10.127
[SPEAKER_20]: Let's Groove, not the DDR version, but the original Earth, Wind, Fire.

01:53:11.307 --> 01:53:13.348
[SPEAKER_20]: And Rapper's Delight, Sugar Hill Gang.

01:53:13.448 --> 01:53:14.308
[SPEAKER_24]: What the hell?

01:53:14.868 --> 01:53:16.189
[SPEAKER_20]: Hey, that's kind of hot.

01:53:17.059 --> 01:53:19.682
[SPEAKER_32]: They're borrowing a lot from Dancing Stage, I can see.

01:53:20.022 --> 01:53:21.064
[SPEAKER_20]: Interesting.

01:53:21.464 --> 01:53:22.365
[SPEAKER_26]: Seems to be interesting.

01:53:22.946 --> 01:53:23.486
[SPEAKER_20]: Alright.

01:53:24.287 --> 01:53:26.470
[SPEAKER_20]: And then, like, just a whole shitload of Banya songs.

01:53:27.448 --> 01:53:45.325
[SPEAKER_32]: I've also noticed that we have about 15 songs less so far than the Korean version and I think that's a pretty good move because it seems like in the Korean song list they put all of their good stuff on one disc and I don't like that.

01:53:45.625 --> 01:53:53.412
[SPEAKER_32]: If I see all of their good stuff in one game it probably means that they're not going to have a hell of a lot of good stuff for the sequel.

01:53:54.958 --> 01:53:58.923
[SPEAKER_20]: My only concern with buying this game at this point is that I don't want to spend the money on the other pad.

01:53:59.204 --> 01:54:00.726
[SPEAKER_20]: So this game better be well-priced.

01:54:02.608 --> 01:54:10.338
[SPEAKER_32]: But they say this is going to be bundled with a pad, so at least there's that.

01:54:11.260 --> 01:54:12.341
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, I'm willing to check it out.

01:54:14.304 --> 01:54:16.485
[SPEAKER_32]: I'm just happy that I get to play Turkey March at home.

01:54:18.245 --> 01:54:19.106
[SPEAKER_32]: I'm not that fickle.

01:54:20.226 --> 01:54:21.967
[SPEAKER_32]: For DDR, it's Moonlight Shadow.

01:54:22.567 --> 01:54:24.527
[SPEAKER_32]: And to a lesser extent, Undude Trois.

01:54:24.647 --> 01:54:26.928
[SPEAKER_32]: For Pump It Up, it's Turkey March.

01:54:27.708 --> 01:54:28.109
[SPEAKER_20]: You know what?

01:54:28.189 --> 01:54:30.169
[SPEAKER_20]: And for me, it's Funky Tonight.

01:54:30.289 --> 01:54:31.050
[SPEAKER_20]: I love that song.

01:54:31.330 --> 01:54:32.930
[SPEAKER_20]: And Starion.

01:54:33.951 --> 01:54:35.891
[SPEAKER_20]: So I'm thrilled as hell about this mix.

01:54:36.231 --> 01:54:36.831
[SPEAKER_20]: So that's cool.

01:54:37.392 --> 01:54:40.893
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you for giving us a heads up to the song list there.

01:54:40.913 --> 01:54:41.413
[SPEAKER_20]: I appreciate that.

01:54:41.897 --> 01:54:43.779
[SPEAKER_20]: www.insidepulse.com visit it, love it, read his column have a good one, bye bye

01:55:03.001 --> 01:55:03.962
[SPEAKER_26]: Yeah, I agree too.

01:55:04.462 --> 01:55:06.944
[SPEAKER_20]: I would read it all for you guys, but there's a lot to it.

01:55:06.984 --> 01:55:10.687
[SPEAKER_20]: But basically, all those big pump songs you guys know about, they're in there.

01:55:10.967 --> 01:55:14.570
[SPEAKER_20]: Actually, I didn't see if Run To You was in there, but somebody in the chatroom will tell me.

01:55:14.630 --> 01:55:23.476
[SPEAKER_26]: I don't think so, because they took out the license for Run To You and XSEED 2, and they're probably taking out the new license from DJ Doc itself.

01:55:24.537 --> 01:55:25.398
[SPEAKER_20]: Maybe, I don't know, we'll see.

01:55:25.438 --> 01:55:26.599
[SPEAKER_20]: Somebody in the chatroom will tell me, I don't know.

01:55:26.619 --> 01:55:27.059
[SPEAKER_26]: We'll see what's up.

01:55:27.899 --> 01:55:30.580
[SPEAKER_20]: Alright, why don't we get to the cage match?

01:55:30.660 --> 01:55:33.982
[SPEAKER_20]: I will open up the Skype line again a little bit later in the show if you guys are interested in calling in.

01:55:34.022 --> 01:55:40.445
[SPEAKER_20]: But for right now, we're going to get into the Orange Lounge Radio cage match because we're running a little bit behind in show right now.

01:55:41.666 --> 01:55:45.188
[SPEAKER_20]: So remember guys, if you want to participate in the cage match, you have to be in our chat room.

01:55:46.108 --> 01:55:50.910
[SPEAKER_20]: www.orangeloungeradio.com and click on chat.

01:55:52.771 --> 01:55:53.972
[SPEAKER_20]: And we're going to move into the cage match.

01:55:56.129 --> 01:56:00.194
[SPEAKER_20]: The way the Orange Lounge Radio Cage Match works, we play three songs for you guys.

01:56:00.214 --> 01:56:09.604
[SPEAKER_20]: You guys vote on your favorite, and the winning song goes into rotation all week long on Orange Lounge Radio's 24-7 Bomani Music & More program.

01:56:10.185 --> 01:56:14.971
[SPEAKER_20]: Last week in the Orange Lounge Cage Match, Freeze Poop, I'm sorry, Freeze Pop won.

01:56:17.625 --> 01:56:19.607
[SPEAKER_20]: You have to hear all their songs so you can get that joke.

01:56:20.028 --> 01:56:28.297
[SPEAKER_20]: Freeze Pop, a favorite band of ours from Amplitude and Frequency and Boston, won with their song called Stakeout.

01:56:32.119 --> 01:56:32.960
[SPEAKER_20]: All right, well, we'll see.

01:56:33.240 --> 01:56:36.503
[SPEAKER_20]: Will Loki be happy and Freeze Pop will be voted out tonight?

01:56:36.943 --> 01:56:39.726
[SPEAKER_20]: Or will I be happy and this song stays in for another week?

01:56:39.786 --> 01:56:40.426
[SPEAKER_20]: We will find out.

01:56:40.466 --> 01:56:41.567
[SPEAKER_20]: It's in your hands, you guys.

01:56:41.988 --> 01:56:44.990
[SPEAKER_20]: Here's a clip, because you only get to hear a clip because it won last week.

01:56:45.331 --> 01:56:47.312
[SPEAKER_20]: Remember, you can't vote until all three songs have played.

01:56:47.352 --> 01:56:51.256
[SPEAKER_20]: Here's a clip of song number one, last week's winner, Freeze Pop, Stakeout.

01:57:14.508 --> 01:57:18.672
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm on a stakeout I'm on a stakeout I'm on a stakeout

01:57:36.913 --> 01:57:49.687
[SPEAKER_03]: I've got a plan in mind for you I'm waiting till the time is right I know that you like what I do No need to put up a fight Watching you from far away You look so sweet and clueless Soon I'll move in on my prey It's time for me to do this

01:58:06.620 --> 01:58:16.250
[SPEAKER_03]: The feeling is elating, biding my time Yeah, I know that you'll soon be mine Soon to mine Can't let you see me, can't let you see me, can't let you see me

01:58:49.688 --> 01:58:52.511
DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

01:59:10.464 --> 01:59:18.366
[SPEAKER_19]: I picked this song by a group that sounds just like Echo Image, and they also have, their group name is almost like Echo Image, it's Echoing Green.

01:59:19.286 --> 01:59:19.686
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay.

01:59:21.066 --> 01:59:22.447
[SPEAKER_19]: And this is the time of my life.

01:59:23.087 --> 01:59:24.347
[SPEAKER_20]: Actually, it's the story of our lives.

01:59:24.387 --> 01:59:27.628
[SPEAKER_19]: Whatever, story of our lives, time of my life, close enough.

01:59:27.708 --> 01:59:28.868
[SPEAKER_19]: Story of our lives.

01:59:29.068 --> 01:59:30.488
[SPEAKER_20]: Any reason you wanted to pick this?

01:59:31.008 --> 01:59:33.509
[SPEAKER_19]: It just, I don't know, it reminded me of Echo Image.

01:59:34.429 --> 01:59:38.910
[SPEAKER_20]: Alright, here it is, song number two, Loki's pick, Echoing Green, Story of Our Lives.

01:59:54.696 --> 02:00:00.479
[SPEAKER_14]: and everything is meaningless when the weather's waiting we're captive to this place

02:00:47.303 --> 02:01:12.881
[SPEAKER_14]: A song to stay behind to sing the story of our lives In this place, loneliness is never-ending constant

02:01:21.538 --> 02:01:22.903
[SPEAKER_14]: DarkSakura.com

02:02:40.931 --> 02:02:41.971
Music Music Music Music Music

02:03:12.152 --> 02:03:12.739
Thanks for watching!

02:04:40.013 --> 02:04:40.574
Thanks for watching!

02:05:10.539 --> 02:05:12.779
[SPEAKER_20]: Okay, that was song number two in tonight's cage match.

02:05:12.919 --> 02:05:15.340
[SPEAKER_20]: Echoing Green, Story of Our Lives.

02:05:15.800 --> 02:05:17.920
[SPEAKER_20]: Let's see what we thought of that here in the room.

02:05:18.040 --> 02:05:19.421
[SPEAKER_20]: Start off with Angel tonight.

02:05:20.461 --> 02:05:23.821
[SPEAKER_30]: I thought it did remind me a little bit of Echo Image, so I'll give them that.

02:05:24.081 --> 02:05:26.022
[SPEAKER_30]: Um, it's pretty good.

02:05:26.042 --> 02:05:28.762
[SPEAKER_30]: Um, seven and a half.

02:05:29.502 --> 02:05:30.423
[SPEAKER_21]: Alright, Exquisite.

02:05:32.503 --> 02:05:33.623
[SPEAKER_26]: Uh, Nate, it's pretty good.

02:05:33.963 --> 02:05:36.164
[SPEAKER_26]: I can see a big influence on Echo Image.

02:05:36.544 --> 02:05:36.944
[SPEAKER_21]: Alright.

02:05:37.724 --> 02:05:38.044
[SPEAKER_21]: Uh, Bug.

02:05:40.470 --> 02:05:40.770
[SPEAKER_21]: What?

02:05:42.951 --> 02:05:44.332
[SPEAKER_21]: Give it a score on a scale of 1 to 10.

02:05:45.513 --> 02:05:46.013
[SPEAKER_21]: Alright, fine.

02:05:46.053 --> 02:05:46.373
[SPEAKER_21]: Loki.

02:05:47.314 --> 02:05:47.654
[SPEAKER_21]: Loki.

02:05:48.775 --> 02:05:52.617
[SPEAKER_19]: I liked it, so it gets a 9.

02:05:53.658 --> 02:06:01.923
[SPEAKER_20]: For once, I actually kind of like a song that Loki put in Cage Match a whole lot, but I think it's a little long and it's kind of weird for Cage Match.

02:06:02.083 --> 02:06:06.426
[SPEAKER_20]: I don't know if I could hear that on our station, but I like the song, so I have to give it at least an 8.

02:06:07.246 --> 02:06:07.787
[SPEAKER_20]: It's not like an 8.5.

02:06:08.877 --> 02:06:13.761
[SPEAKER_20]: Alright, let's get into song number three this week, which comes to us via DarkSakura.

02:06:13.861 --> 02:06:18.165
[SPEAKER_20]: Even though she's not here tonight, she still gets to put a song in, so here it is.

02:06:18.605 --> 02:06:21.948
[SPEAKER_20]: She has chosen some Schwarzstein for you guys.

02:06:23.169 --> 02:06:26.372
[SPEAKER_20]: And I believe it's a band she put in Cage Match before, but this is a new song.

02:06:26.412 --> 02:06:29.734
[SPEAKER_20]: It's called Faster Love, and it's song number three in tonight's Cage Match.

02:06:29.774 --> 02:06:30.235
[SPEAKER_20]: Enjoy, you guys.

02:06:33.945 --> 02:06:34.646
Thanks for watching!

02:07:06.988 --> 02:07:08.190
Thanks for watching!

02:07:37.057 --> 02:07:38.158
Thank you for watching!

02:08:37.350 --> 02:08:39.671
Thank you for watching!

02:09:07.831 --> 02:09:09.132
[SPEAKER_14]: DarkSakura

02:09:49.491 --> 02:09:50.872
Thank you for watching.

02:09:50.932 --> 02:09:52.233
See you next time.

02:10:22.182 --> 02:10:23.422
Thank you for watching!

02:10:45.262 --> 02:10:46.602
Thank you for watching!

02:11:20.515 --> 02:11:25.659
[SPEAKER_20]: Song number three, Schwerstein, and that was actually called Festerlove, not Fasterlove.

02:11:25.699 --> 02:11:26.940
[SPEAKER_20]: I fucked that up when I was announcing it.

02:11:26.960 --> 02:11:27.620
[SPEAKER_20]: It's Festerlove.

02:11:27.920 --> 02:11:31.303
[SPEAKER_20]: I have a strange feeling that Jamie picked that one on purpose with the holiday tomorrow.

02:11:31.463 --> 02:11:31.823
[SPEAKER_20]: I don't know.

02:11:32.604 --> 02:11:32.904
[SPEAKER_20]: Angel.

02:11:35.005 --> 02:11:37.347
[SPEAKER_11]: It was okay.

02:11:37.407 --> 02:11:39.569
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm not sure if that's it.

02:11:40.790 --> 02:11:41.750
[SPEAKER_11]: She's seven.

02:11:42.971 --> 02:11:43.291
[SPEAKER_17]: All right.

02:11:44.292 --> 02:11:44.772
[SPEAKER_17]: Exquisite.

02:11:45.793 --> 02:11:46.514
[SPEAKER_26]: You have to...

02:11:47.392 --> 02:11:49.213
[SPEAKER_26]: I dub it Cher Takes Up Nose Whistling.

02:11:49.253 --> 02:11:50.514
[SPEAKER_26]: It went on far too long.

02:11:50.534 --> 02:11:50.634
[SPEAKER_26]: Three.

02:11:50.694 --> 02:11:51.014
[SPEAKER_26]: Uh, Loki.

02:12:14.600 --> 02:12:20.282
[SPEAKER_19]: If Cher were retarded and were to sing gothic music, that would be the song.

02:12:21.602 --> 02:12:25.043
[SPEAKER_19]: So it gets a 2.

02:12:25.303 --> 02:12:28.704
[SPEAKER_20]: That song, I kind of liked the beat a lot.

02:12:29.764 --> 02:12:33.005
[SPEAKER_20]: So that was really cool, and I was all into the song when it first started.

02:12:33.025 --> 02:12:37.466
[SPEAKER_20]: But the guy's voice, if emo were on a scale of 0 to 10, he was like a 15.

02:12:37.586 --> 02:12:40.947
[SPEAKER_20]: It just made me want to slit my wrist.

02:12:41.417 --> 02:12:45.358
[SPEAKER_20]: So, I don't know, I guess I would give it like a... Six and a half?

02:12:45.578 --> 02:12:46.058
[SPEAKER_20]: Eh, seven.

02:12:46.138 --> 02:12:47.098
[SPEAKER_20]: I'll give it a seven overall.

02:12:48.079 --> 02:12:52.640
[SPEAKER_20]: I mean, I like the music a lot, it was just the guy's voice was kind of like, oh god, ah, wow.

02:12:53.080 --> 02:12:56.841
[SPEAKER_20]: Alright, so remember though, it isn't up to us, it's up to you guys in the chatroom.

02:12:57.201 --> 02:12:59.182
[SPEAKER_20]: So here it is, a recap, and then you can vote.

02:13:27.875 --> 02:13:34.139
[SPEAKER_14]: And song number three you can vote for tonight is Schwarzstein, Fester Love.

02:13:50.277 --> 02:13:54.019
[SPEAKER_20]: In the meantime, Loki, what's going on in the sim scene right now?

02:13:56.341 --> 02:14:03.105
[SPEAKER_19]: You know, I hate to say this, but nothing, absolutely nada is happening in the sim scene right now.

02:14:04.146 --> 02:14:04.686
[SPEAKER_19]: I can't even...

02:14:05.757 --> 02:14:10.360
[SPEAKER_19]: I can't really even comment on anything that's going on because really there's nothing going on.

02:14:10.520 --> 02:14:10.860
[SPEAKER_19]: Nothing.

02:14:10.980 --> 02:14:11.220
[SPEAKER_19]: Zip.

02:14:12.041 --> 02:14:12.781
[SPEAKER_19]: No tournaments.

02:14:13.442 --> 02:14:14.442
[SPEAKER_19]: No files.

02:14:15.563 --> 02:14:16.123
[SPEAKER_19]: No nothing.

02:14:16.204 --> 02:14:17.084
[SPEAKER_19]: Just nothing.

02:14:18.545 --> 02:14:22.828
[SPEAKER_19]: However, however, I will take this time to play you one little song.

02:14:23.668 --> 02:14:28.611
[SPEAKER_19]: Because this is a sim file and yes, it's one of those ones I downloaded.

02:14:28.751 --> 02:14:29.071
[SPEAKER_19]: Why?

02:14:29.192 --> 02:14:31.713
[SPEAKER_19]: Because it says Max 300 Remix.

02:14:32.894 --> 02:14:34.695
[SPEAKER_19]: So why do I... I thought you hated those Maxes.

02:14:35.294 --> 02:14:36.696
[SPEAKER_19]: I have to listen to every single one.

02:14:36.856 --> 02:14:40.180
[SPEAKER_19]: It is my duty to listen to them just in case there's a good one.

02:14:40.280 --> 02:14:42.843
[SPEAKER_19]: And honestly, that happens every now and then.

02:14:43.363 --> 02:14:49.230
[SPEAKER_19]: So, this song, for your listening pleasure, is Max Vagina.

02:14:50.211 --> 02:14:50.712
[SPEAKER_19]: That's right.

02:14:51.172 --> 02:14:52.093
[SPEAKER_19]: Max Vagina.

02:14:52.293 --> 02:14:52.654
[SPEAKER_19]: Enjoy.

02:14:52.674 --> 02:14:53.835
[SPEAKER_19]: Max Vagina.

02:16:39.349 --> 02:16:43.311
[SPEAKER_20]: So yeah, that's what's going on in the sim scene right there.

02:16:43.371 --> 02:16:45.793
[SPEAKER_20]: Explicit, did you get a boner with that song?

02:16:45.853 --> 02:16:47.274
[SPEAKER_24]: I was about to say that, no!

02:16:48.815 --> 02:16:49.495
[SPEAKER_24]: It struck more.

02:16:50.856 --> 02:16:52.237
[SPEAKER_24]: What the hell was that?

02:16:52.677 --> 02:16:55.559
[SPEAKER_24]: Seriously, what was that?

02:16:55.599 --> 02:16:56.840
[SPEAKER_26]: I can explain what that is.

02:16:57.500 --> 02:16:59.061
[SPEAKER_26]: I know where the sources are from, it

02:16:59.676 --> 02:17:01.896
[SPEAKER_26]: Okay, first I take away... Wait a minute, wait a minute.

02:17:01.916 --> 02:17:03.857
[SPEAKER_20]: Is this why you had to give up the boner thing for Lent?

02:17:06.798 --> 02:17:07.798
[SPEAKER_26]: I'm not gonna comment from that.

02:17:08.538 --> 02:17:09.598
[SPEAKER_26]: It's not even close.

02:17:09.658 --> 02:17:12.459
[SPEAKER_26]: Because there's no visuals.

02:17:12.619 --> 02:17:13.979
[SPEAKER_26]: Sound effects, okay, I can handle.

02:17:14.599 --> 02:17:21.221
[SPEAKER_26]: I can hear... All the time without getting a boner, but... Visuals... Is where it comes from.

02:17:21.341 --> 02:17:22.521
[SPEAKER_26]: Anyways, back to the story.

02:17:23.041 --> 02:17:24.201
[SPEAKER_26]: Lent was crap.

02:17:24.781 --> 02:17:26.522
[SPEAKER_26]: I know the sources where it came from.

02:17:26.602 --> 02:17:27.362
[SPEAKER_26]: It's basically Max150...

02:17:32.237 --> 02:17:49.937
[SPEAKER_26]: and I think the sound effects that were like the porno sounds is from the video the porno video from City Crawford I actually have that DVD too it's from a song by a group called the Porno Rockers that's the group name um

02:17:52.000 --> 02:17:55.242
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, it's just like, you know, I don't know.

02:17:55.262 --> 02:17:56.904
[SPEAKER_19]: It's more like a cut and paste issue.

02:17:57.244 --> 02:18:00.446
[SPEAKER_19]: I download that stuff just because, you know, it's fun to hear.

02:18:00.866 --> 02:18:05.610
[SPEAKER_19]: You just have to listen to them because you don't really realize how bad they are.

02:18:06.130 --> 02:18:07.791
[SPEAKER_19]: But then again, those are funny sometimes.

02:18:08.732 --> 02:18:12.054
[SPEAKER_20]: To the person who made that, screw you.

02:18:12.415 --> 02:18:15.557
[SPEAKER_20]: Seriously, sorry, but what the hell was that?

02:18:16.738 --> 02:18:45.699
[SPEAKER_19]: You can think, BanzaiGTV Oh, I know, I've seen this guy remixed, okay And he has done other sim files also, like Sabrina, a step file announcer, which is someone on But we have Paranoia Extreme Rock Mix, Twinkle Twinkle Shocking Star, the Sailor Moon theme Yeah, he's got quite a bit of stuff he's done, but whatever

02:18:46.829 --> 02:18:48.049
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't know, I thought that was funny.

02:18:48.389 --> 02:18:52.191
[SPEAKER_26]: This is why I stopped downloading stuff from Be Mighty Star, unless they're good quality.

02:18:53.911 --> 02:18:59.953
[SPEAKER_26]: I'm sick and tired of hearing Max remixes that are cut and paste, that sound like too much cut and paste.

02:19:01.473 --> 02:19:03.334
[SPEAKER_17]: All I have to say is dot, dot, dot.

02:19:04.934 --> 02:19:06.815
[SPEAKER_20]: You guys want to find out who won tonight's cage match?

02:19:07.955 --> 02:19:08.535
[SPEAKER_17]: You ready to know?

02:19:08.555 --> 02:19:10.376
[SPEAKER_17]: Alright, here it is.

02:19:11.096 --> 02:19:14.817
[SPEAKER_20]: Winning song of tonight's cage match as determined by your votes...

02:19:17.765 --> 02:19:18.986
[SPEAKER_20]: Freeze Pop!

02:19:20.167 --> 02:19:23.349
[SPEAKER_20]: Two weeks in a row, Freeze Pop wins tonight.

02:19:24.490 --> 02:19:26.591
[SPEAKER_20]: Not very many votes ahead of the other two, though.

02:19:26.792 --> 02:19:28.153
[SPEAKER_20]: Kind of surprising, it was kind of close.

02:19:28.213 --> 02:19:33.096
[SPEAKER_20]: A lot more votes for songs two and three than I would have guessed from the initial chatroom feedback.

02:19:34.717 --> 02:19:39.741
[SPEAKER_20]: Some very interesting thoughts there in the chatroom.

02:19:40.276 --> 02:19:41.397
[SPEAKER_20]: Anyway, we're going to go to a break.

02:19:42.337 --> 02:19:46.760
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm out of theme ideas for this break, so I think we're just going to play random stuff in this break.

02:19:48.301 --> 02:19:52.444
[SPEAKER_20]: We'll come back after this with more Orange Lounge Radio, including the FUs of the week.

02:19:53.204 --> 02:19:57.887
[SPEAKER_20]: I want to do a little more Skype later on if we can, etc., etc.

02:19:57.988 --> 02:20:00.909
[SPEAKER_20]: So in this break, we'll start off with The Shining Polaris.

02:20:00.949 --> 02:20:01.870
[SPEAKER_20]: We haven't played this song in a while.

02:20:02.130 --> 02:20:02.911
[SPEAKER_20]: We'll be back after this.

02:20:03.791 --> 02:20:04.532
[SPEAKER_20]: More Orange Lounge Radio.

[SPEAKER_20]: Hello and welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio, episode 131 in progress.

02:27:47.113 --> 02:27:48.194
[SPEAKER_20]: We just wrapped up the cage match.

02:27:48.214 --> 02:27:49.434
[SPEAKER_20]: We're going to move into the FUs of the Week.

02:27:50.120 --> 02:28:02.269
[SPEAKER_20]: However, what we're going to do now is actually, I wanted to talk to some folks, some friends of the show, because I figured, you know, it's Valentine's Day and this would be an appropriate theme to do, right?

02:28:02.670 --> 02:28:05.752
[SPEAKER_20]: We're going to talk to an actual DDR couple.

02:28:07.433 --> 02:28:08.354
[SPEAKER_20]: Isn't this going to be nice?

02:28:08.494 --> 02:28:09.375
[SPEAKER_20]: Alright, let's talk to them.

02:28:09.415 --> 02:28:10.916
[SPEAKER_20]: Let me give them a call and see if they pick up.

02:28:12.197 --> 02:28:15.079
[SPEAKER_20]: I figured something to fit with the theme of the holiday coming up.

02:28:15.700 --> 02:28:16.280
[SPEAKER_20]: One ringy dingy.

02:28:21.597 --> 02:28:22.558
[SPEAKER_21]: Hello?

02:28:24.178 --> 02:28:24.639
[SPEAKER_29]: Hello?

02:28:24.899 --> 02:28:25.399
[SPEAKER_21]: Hello?

02:28:26.880 --> 02:28:28.641
[SPEAKER_20]: Hi, is this Jason and Raichan?

02:28:29.301 --> 02:28:30.041
[SPEAKER_18]: It may be.

02:28:31.342 --> 02:28:32.102
[SPEAKER_20]: I think it is.

02:28:32.683 --> 02:28:33.003
[SPEAKER_18]: It is.

02:28:33.223 --> 02:28:33.943
[SPEAKER_20]: How are you guys?

02:28:34.464 --> 02:28:35.124
[SPEAKER_18]: We're pretty good.

02:28:35.664 --> 02:28:37.645
[SPEAKER_20]: Happy Valentine's Day a little early to you guys.

02:28:38.165 --> 02:28:39.146
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you, Rob.

02:28:39.306 --> 02:28:41.787
[SPEAKER_20]: Now, you guys are under the same roof right now, correct?

02:28:42.268 --> 02:28:42.468
[SPEAKER_18]: Yep.

02:28:42.788 --> 02:28:43.208
[SPEAKER_18]: Thankfully.

02:28:44.184 --> 02:28:45.345
[SPEAKER_20]: Awww, so cute.

02:28:45.745 --> 02:28:50.428
[SPEAKER_20]: Because now, for those that don't know, you guys are kind of doing one of those long-distance thingy-thingies, right?

02:28:50.908 --> 02:28:51.128
[SPEAKER_13]: Yep.

02:28:51.648 --> 02:28:54.730
[SPEAKER_20]: So you have to travel once in a while to see each other, so... Yep.

02:28:55.030 --> 02:28:56.191
[SPEAKER_20]: That's what's going on right now.

02:28:56.591 --> 02:29:01.754
[SPEAKER_20]: Well, with the holiday coming up, and I can't help but think of all those threads on DDR Freak that goes...

02:29:02.344 --> 02:29:05.127
[SPEAKER_20]: Oh my gods, how do I meet a girlfriend playing DDR?

02:29:05.767 --> 02:29:11.473
[SPEAKER_20]: So I just thought maybe you guys could share a little bit about how you guys met and how it moved on, everything like that.

02:29:11.493 --> 02:29:14.055
[SPEAKER_20]: If you could give us a little history of your guys' relationship.

02:29:16.217 --> 02:29:19.180
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, see, me being a whole Southwest moderator...

02:29:22.230 --> 02:29:23.730
[SPEAKER_18]: Slurred over private messages.

02:29:44.105 --> 02:29:50.970
[SPEAKER_18]: and me being the good, dutiful moderator had to tell her that, hey, right-hand, your images are too big.

02:29:51.110 --> 02:29:52.391
[SPEAKER_18]: Could you link them for me, please?

02:29:54.152 --> 02:29:59.736
[SPEAKER_18]: And as soon as I did that, I was rummaging around LiveJournal and apparently she knew one of my friends as well.

02:30:00.317 --> 02:30:05.881
[SPEAKER_18]: I saw her avatar and a picture and a comment and we just kind of started talking.

02:30:06.826 --> 02:30:13.048
[SPEAKER_01]: And you actually forgot to mention the fact that in that PM it said, I hate to cover up such a pretty face.

02:30:13.128 --> 02:30:15.289
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh, of course, you have to have that.

02:30:15.989 --> 02:30:16.970
[SPEAKER_20]: Oh, la la la.

02:30:17.130 --> 02:30:17.930
[SPEAKER_20]: Oh, that's so cute.

02:30:20.471 --> 02:30:22.752
[SPEAKER_20]: Right, Chan, what was your reaction when you got the private message?

02:30:22.872 --> 02:30:25.253
[SPEAKER_20]: Were you like, ah, who's this weirdo hitting on me, or what?

02:30:25.913 --> 02:30:27.714
[SPEAKER_01]: At that point, I didn't see it as that.

02:30:27.814 --> 02:30:32.256
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind of amusing, because I was still, oh my god, it's the moderator, he's messaging me.

02:30:36.590 --> 02:30:40.132
[SPEAKER_20]: So you guys didn't meet necessarily at an arcade or anything.

02:30:40.172 --> 02:30:42.033
[SPEAKER_20]: You actually met through the online forums.

02:30:42.954 --> 02:30:44.475
[SPEAKER_20]: So what was the first time you guys met in person?

02:30:46.776 --> 02:30:47.596
[SPEAKER_18]: November 1st.

02:30:47.736 --> 02:30:49.077
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes, the night after Halloween.

02:30:50.178 --> 02:30:50.758
[SPEAKER_20]: How did it work out?

02:30:50.798 --> 02:30:51.459
[SPEAKER_20]: How did you guys meet?

02:30:51.519 --> 02:30:52.099
[SPEAKER_20]: How did it all happen?

02:30:53.160 --> 02:30:57.202
[SPEAKER_18]: I was going to take a trip up to Colorado, and I did.

02:30:58.823 --> 02:30:59.903
[SPEAKER_20]: It's just that simple, huh?

02:31:00.444 --> 02:31:00.884
[SPEAKER_18]: Pretty much.

02:31:01.805 --> 02:31:04.186
[SPEAKER_20]: Wow, well, you make interviewing really easy then.

02:31:04.734 --> 02:31:08.857
[SPEAKER_20]: I must get dead pleasing.

02:31:10.098 --> 02:31:14.001
[SPEAKER_18]: Officially, it would be, what, a year and a month now?

02:31:14.562 --> 02:31:21.166
[SPEAKER_18]: And that was only three months before when we first met, so one year and four months now, and one year and one month officially.

02:31:21.186 --> 02:31:22.968
[SPEAKER_20]: Mm-hmm.

02:31:27.256 --> 02:31:30.578
[SPEAKER_20]: So do you guys play DDR together or any of that dorky stuff?

02:31:30.658 --> 02:31:32.779
[SPEAKER_20]: Or what do you guys, is DDR just kind of there?

02:31:32.840 --> 02:31:34.440
[SPEAKER_20]: It's just an interest you guys both have?

02:31:34.501 --> 02:31:38.863
[SPEAKER_20]: Or do you sometimes go out and do the nerdy Bomani things together, like travel to arcades?

02:31:38.903 --> 02:31:39.644
[SPEAKER_20]: Or what do you guys do?

02:31:39.684 --> 02:31:42.185
[SPEAKER_01]: Yesterday I went to MGL.

02:31:42.345 --> 02:31:44.187
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, mostly Jason Blade.

02:31:44.527 --> 02:31:46.868
[SPEAKER_01]: The night before that we went and played some 2DX.

02:31:47.609 --> 02:31:48.689
[SPEAKER_01]: Played a little bit of DDR.

02:31:49.210 --> 02:31:51.011
[SPEAKER_01]: Beatmania 3, Dance Maniacs.

02:31:52.412 --> 02:31:54.413
[SPEAKER_20]: Do you guys have little competitions or anything like that?

02:31:55.854 --> 02:31:57.275
[SPEAKER_18]: She owns me in home versions.

02:31:57.716 --> 02:32:00.178
[SPEAKER_18]: I usually do it a little bit better in the arcade, but not always.

02:32:01.039 --> 02:32:01.900
[SPEAKER_20]: Oh, that's kind of cute.

02:32:02.481 --> 02:32:02.621
Yeah.

02:32:03.461 --> 02:32:04.703
[SPEAKER_20]: Any plans for the big day tomorrow?

02:32:06.544 --> 02:32:12.330
[SPEAKER_18]: Going to work, unfortunately for me, but I'm going to go in early so I can get out early and take her out to dinner or something really nice.

02:32:12.590 --> 02:32:15.093
[SPEAKER_20]: Did somebody say fucking in the microphone?

02:32:16.354 --> 02:32:17.075
[SPEAKER_20]: Shame on you.

02:32:17.135 --> 02:32:18.136
[SPEAKER_20]: This is a family show.

02:32:19.433 --> 02:32:21.874
[SPEAKER_20]: Bug just... Was that Angel?

02:32:22.255 --> 02:32:23.295
[SPEAKER_20]: Angel did that?

02:32:23.355 --> 02:32:23.575
[SPEAKER_20]: No.

02:32:24.076 --> 02:32:24.596
[SPEAKER_20]: It was Bug.

02:32:24.836 --> 02:32:26.377
[SPEAKER_20]: Bug was whispering in the microphone.

02:32:26.698 --> 02:32:30.020
[SPEAKER_20]: Fucking... He probably just couldn't hear it.

02:32:32.341 --> 02:32:33.742
[SPEAKER_20]: That's none of your business.

02:32:33.983 --> 02:32:34.883
[SPEAKER_20]: That's none of your business.

02:32:34.903 --> 02:32:35.944
[SPEAKER_20]: Don't you know that's rude?

02:32:37.565 --> 02:32:38.145
[SPEAKER_02]: Damn straight.

02:32:38.606 --> 02:32:39.046
[SPEAKER_20]: Sides.

02:32:40.107 --> 02:32:42.829
[SPEAKER_20]: We all know they're going to stay virginal until they get married.

02:32:43.549 --> 02:32:43.829
[SPEAKER_20]: Right?

02:32:44.430 --> 02:32:44.630
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah.

02:32:44.910 --> 02:32:45.430
[SPEAKER_20]: Okay, anyway.

02:32:46.711 --> 02:32:47.652
[SPEAKER_20]: Let's change the topic.

02:32:50.864 --> 02:32:53.365
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought I already changed the topic right there.

02:32:53.585 --> 02:33:01.511
[SPEAKER_20]: Do you guys have any advice for those guys out there that are all sad because of the Valentine's Day holiday and all they want is a gamer girlfriend?

02:33:01.591 --> 02:33:02.531
[SPEAKER_20]: Do you guys have any advice?

02:33:03.392 --> 02:33:04.293
[SPEAKER_18]: Stop whining.

02:33:04.693 --> 02:33:05.694
[SPEAKER_18]: Stop bitching.

02:33:06.214 --> 02:33:08.475
[SPEAKER_18]: Stop obsessing.

02:33:09.096 --> 02:33:13.719
[SPEAKER_18]: And be yourself and try opening your mouth and shutting it normally.

02:33:14.219 --> 02:33:16.321
[SPEAKER_19]: And commit suicide.

02:33:16.421 --> 02:33:17.261
[SPEAKER_29]: Amen to all that.

02:33:17.341 --> 02:33:18.022
[SPEAKER_20]: Stop it, Loki.

02:33:18.302 --> 02:33:18.682
[SPEAKER_20]: Stop it.

02:33:19.142 --> 02:33:19.763
[SPEAKER_20]: And buy lots of lube.

02:33:21.844 --> 02:33:25.207
[SPEAKER_20]: She's also had people try hitting on me through her.

02:33:50.766 --> 02:33:53.667
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, they express their, uh, fads.

02:33:54.487 --> 02:33:59.269
[SPEAKER_18]: I wouldn't say, no, not fantasies, but they express their heavy likes for me.

02:33:59.749 --> 02:34:00.589
[SPEAKER_18]: Other guys, yes.

02:34:01.690 --> 02:34:03.790
[SPEAKER_17]: And I apologize profusely about that, Jason.

02:34:04.490 --> 02:34:07.091
[SPEAKER_18]: It's okay, Rob.

02:34:07.111 --> 02:34:07.831
[SPEAKER_18]: We know you're on it.

02:34:08.632 --> 02:34:16.074
[SPEAKER_19]: All these nerdy people need to do is just rent a porno, get a nice dinner, and it's like a date right there.

02:34:18.567 --> 02:34:18.967
[SPEAKER_14]: Wow.

02:34:47.523 --> 02:34:49.265
[SPEAKER_18]: For some reason, I failed to be surprised.

02:34:49.285 --> 02:34:52.968
[SPEAKER_20]: I mean, I know it firsthand, though.

02:34:52.988 --> 02:34:53.188
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

02:35:17.012 --> 02:35:20.556
[SPEAKER_20]: No, actually, I got invited to a gay singles dinner.

02:35:21.918 --> 02:35:24.701
[SPEAKER_20]: How gay is that in the overview?

02:35:26.223 --> 02:35:28.345
[SPEAKER_20]: But yeah, definitely, I'm going, obviously.

02:35:28.846 --> 02:35:31.609
[SPEAKER_20]: It's one of my buddies that's having it, so I'm like, okay, yeah, it sounds like fun.

02:35:32.850 --> 02:35:34.632
[SPEAKER_20]: So there's something for everybody on Valentine's Day.

02:35:35.053 --> 02:35:35.233
[SPEAKER_20]: What?

02:35:36.141 --> 02:35:38.823
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm sure you'll have a gay old time.

02:35:38.923 --> 02:35:43.507
[SPEAKER_20]: I will, and then I'm going to come home and masturbate until the sun rises next day.

02:35:43.907 --> 02:35:44.688
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm kidding, I'm kidding.

02:35:44.708 --> 02:35:45.649
[SPEAKER_20]: Thanks for the details.

02:35:45.749 --> 02:35:47.210
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm kidding, I'm kidding, I'm totally kidding.

02:35:48.051 --> 02:35:50.673
[SPEAKER_20]: Anything else you guys want to share about... You don't have that much stamina.

02:35:51.554 --> 02:35:51.874
[SPEAKER_20]: Shut up.

02:35:52.354 --> 02:35:53.735
[SPEAKER_20]: Anything else you guys want to share?

02:35:54.096 --> 02:35:57.178
[SPEAKER_20]: Any exciting things going on this week while she's paying a visit?

02:35:59.300 --> 02:36:03.303
[SPEAKER_18]: For some reason I keep thinking she's going to leave on Saturday, but she's actually here until Tuesday.

02:36:03.924 --> 02:36:05.345
[SPEAKER_18]: And so that's making me happy every day.

02:36:05.365 --> 02:36:05.665
[SPEAKER_18]: I think I'm

02:36:06.908 --> 02:36:09.109
[SPEAKER_20]: Aw, you were cutting out for half that sentence, but that's okay.

02:36:09.129 --> 02:36:09.729
[SPEAKER_20]: It's still cute.

02:36:10.249 --> 02:36:14.511
[SPEAKER_18]: We're trying to share a headset to the best of our ability.

02:36:14.931 --> 02:36:15.311
[SPEAKER_20]: Oh, I see.

02:36:15.331 --> 02:36:15.751
[SPEAKER_20]: That's cool.

02:36:16.712 --> 02:36:20.073
[SPEAKER_20]: Rai-Chan, any plans for this week?

02:36:21.614 --> 02:36:22.134
[SPEAKER_01]: Not really.

02:36:22.894 --> 02:36:24.195
[SPEAKER_20]: Just enjoying each other's company?

02:36:24.215 --> 02:36:25.795
[SPEAKER_18]: Spend it normally, like our advice says.

02:36:26.215 --> 02:36:26.515
[SPEAKER_20]: Okay.

02:36:26.856 --> 02:36:27.336
[SPEAKER_20]: That's cool.

02:36:27.616 --> 02:36:28.076
[SPEAKER_20]: Works for me.

02:36:28.096 --> 02:36:29.116
[SPEAKER_20]: All right, you guys.

02:36:29.316 --> 02:36:32.057
[SPEAKER_20]: Thanks for letting us bug you, and have a happy Valentine's Day, okay?

02:36:32.117 --> 02:36:32.778
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you, Rob.

02:36:32.798 --> 02:36:33.358
[SPEAKER_20]: You're welcome.

02:36:33.378 --> 02:36:33.558
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you.

02:36:33.925 --> 02:36:34.445
[SPEAKER_20]: Bye.

02:36:34.525 --> 02:36:34.925
[SPEAKER_20]: Kisses.

02:36:35.266 --> 02:36:36.126
[SPEAKER_20]: Bye-bye.

02:36:36.406 --> 02:36:38.847
[SPEAKER_20]: It was nice to talk to them.

02:36:39.247 --> 02:36:39.487
[SPEAKER_20]: What?

02:36:40.367 --> 02:36:41.548
[SPEAKER_02]: None of us here are bitter, right?

02:36:42.828 --> 02:36:43.329
[SPEAKER_20]: Let's see.

02:36:44.409 --> 02:36:49.631
[SPEAKER_20]: Single, single, single, dating, engaged.

02:36:50.451 --> 02:36:50.911
[SPEAKER_00]: Bitch boy.

02:36:53.272 --> 02:36:55.693
[SPEAKER_20]: So we got mostly single, but anyway.

02:36:57.194 --> 02:36:57.474
[SPEAKER_20]: Oh, well.

02:37:00.157 --> 02:37:02.298
[SPEAKER_20]: What we're going to do now is we're going to get into another segment.

02:37:02.338 --> 02:37:09.083
[SPEAKER_20]: I thought it would be very good to follow up the very lovey-dovey, aw, isn't that cute segment with one of our favorite segments, the FUs of the week.

02:37:10.824 --> 02:37:13.786
[SPEAKER_20]: So what we're going to do now is get into those FUs of the week.

02:37:14.046 --> 02:37:17.989
[SPEAKER_20]: This is the part, oh, by the way, if you guys want to send in an FU of the week, just send me a private message.

02:37:18.089 --> 02:37:23.412
[SPEAKER_20]: My name is Sky in the chat room with your FU, but please try to keep it somewhat reasonable in length.

02:37:23.772 --> 02:37:26.094
[SPEAKER_20]: If it's too long, I'm going to cut it short because I can do that.

02:37:28.573 --> 02:37:30.174
[SPEAKER_20]: That includes you in studio.

02:37:31.855 --> 02:37:37.340
[SPEAKER_20]: So this is the part where I would normally ask Jamie, why do we do the FUs of the week every single week?

02:37:37.400 --> 02:37:41.323
[SPEAKER_20]: But she's not here, so I'm going to ask Loki, why is it we do the FUs of the week every single week?

02:37:42.524 --> 02:37:43.524
[SPEAKER_20]: Because we have anger.

02:37:50.149 --> 02:37:51.931
Oh, this is bad.

02:37:52.011 --> 02:37:52.551
Here is justice.

02:37:52.651 --> 02:37:53.932
[SPEAKER_14]: Here is punishment.

02:37:59.835 --> 02:38:04.456
[SPEAKER_20]: Even though DarkSakura is not here tonight, she's spending the time with her boyfriend.

02:38:04.496 --> 02:38:06.857
[SPEAKER_20]: She did want me to enter in an FU on behalf.

02:38:07.217 --> 02:38:08.997
[SPEAKER_20]: She would like to give an FU to people.

02:38:09.497 --> 02:38:10.398
[SPEAKER_20]: In general, everybody.

02:38:11.298 --> 02:38:11.898
[SPEAKER_20]: So there you go.

02:38:12.138 --> 02:38:13.238
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll give an FU straight back.

02:38:13.778 --> 02:38:14.078
[SPEAKER_20]: Alright.

02:38:14.999 --> 02:38:15.839
[SPEAKER_20]: Loki's turn!

02:38:18.319 --> 02:38:18.820
[SPEAKER_19]: Fuck you, dude.

02:38:18.840 --> 02:38:22.981
[SPEAKER_19]: The company that sold me the goddamn battery for my Orange Box PC.

02:38:23.481 --> 02:38:26.041
[SPEAKER_19]: Because the battery is defective.

02:38:26.281 --> 02:38:27.402
[SPEAKER_19]: It will not charge.

02:38:27.562 --> 02:38:28.842
[SPEAKER_19]: In fact, um...

02:38:29.580 --> 02:38:34.725
[SPEAKER_19]: It charges, according to the battery, about only 75% of the way, because only three of the four lights are on there.

02:38:35.445 --> 02:38:40.590
[SPEAKER_19]: And not only that, when I was trying to charge it and plugging it in, it's all sparky now, the little bottom thing.

02:38:41.090 --> 02:38:42.892
[SPEAKER_19]: So that's probably not a good sign either.

02:38:43.393 --> 02:38:49.316
[SPEAKER_19]: So anyways, so fuck you then, because that battery cost me almost $200, and that doesn't make me too happy.

02:38:50.177 --> 02:39:05.585
[SPEAKER_19]: And then finally, fuck you to The Matrix Online, because I went to go play it yesterday, just to give it a second go around, and it was admins only on that one server I was on, so I said fuck it, I'm tired of this.

02:39:07.116 --> 02:39:08.137
[SPEAKER_19]: So I'm not going to play it.

02:39:09.258 --> 02:39:13.183
[SPEAKER_19]: And it sucks for me for not having any money.

02:39:13.243 --> 02:39:16.927
[SPEAKER_19]: So fuck it to me for spending my money on useless shit that I don't need.

02:39:17.407 --> 02:39:18.548
[SPEAKER_19]: A.K.A.

02:39:18.568 --> 02:39:19.669
[SPEAKER_19]: the Orange Box.

02:39:20.550 --> 02:39:24.134
[SPEAKER_19]: And yeah, that's pretty much it right now.

02:39:33.530 --> 02:39:52.223
[SPEAKER_20]: I'd like to give an F you to myself for being all fashion conscious last night and I was seriously being such a woman and I like changed my outfit like four times before I was willing to leave the house and I was like how does my hair look and I was making I was making Loki and his girlfriend like you know be my fashion judges or whatever so an F you to that.

02:39:53.338 --> 02:39:53.519
[SPEAKER_20]: D.R.

02:39:53.639 --> 02:39:53.839
[SPEAKER_20]: ANGEL

02:40:09.693 --> 02:40:31.307
[SPEAKER_30]: Alright, uh, F you to me for, like, not watching my book more carefully this week, cause I had to get it swiped at least, you know, for 48 hours, and I got all, like, paranoid and, uh, stressed and all that crap, and so the book got, uh, returned to me on Thursday, and all that, so, screw that, um...

02:40:32.779 --> 02:40:40.465
[SPEAKER_30]: F you to KTHR closing down because, um, you know, it was too soon, in my opinion.

02:40:41.106 --> 02:40:44.048
[SPEAKER_30]: But, you know, there's nothing I can do about now, so screw that.

02:40:44.308 --> 02:40:44.789
[SPEAKER_30]: Whatever.

02:40:45.449 --> 02:40:47.931
[SPEAKER_30]: I'll live on, or, you know, I'll move on.

02:40:48.592 --> 02:40:50.133
[SPEAKER_30]: And, uh, fuck you to being an I.L.

02:40:50.153 --> 02:40:55.778
[SPEAKER_30]: because it just makes, you know, that alarm that much sooner to go off and it sucks.

02:40:55.818 --> 02:40:56.198
[SPEAKER_30]: Whatever.

02:40:56.218 --> 02:40:56.318
[SPEAKER_30]: Um...

02:41:00.546 --> 02:41:01.386
[SPEAKER_30]: I guess that's about it.

02:41:01.526 --> 02:41:02.586
[SPEAKER_30]: I don't really know.

02:41:04.107 --> 02:41:06.527
[SPEAKER_30]: I lost my train of thought, so I guess it doesn't matter.

02:41:07.948 --> 02:41:08.288
[SPEAKER_17]: Alright.

02:41:08.488 --> 02:41:09.828
[SPEAKER_30]: So, whatever, I'm done.

02:41:10.228 --> 02:41:11.929
[SPEAKER_17]: Alright, let's move on to Bud.

02:41:11.949 --> 02:41:20.751
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you to myself, because I forgot to invite you to the after funeral party on Tuesday night.

02:41:21.751 --> 02:41:22.891
[SPEAKER_02]: It was Jägermeister.

02:41:23.531 --> 02:41:24.151
[SPEAKER_20]: You're in trouble.

02:41:24.451 --> 02:41:25.011
[SPEAKER_20]: No, that's alright.

02:41:25.051 --> 02:41:25.432
[SPEAKER_20]: It's cool.

02:41:25.472 --> 02:41:25.912
[SPEAKER_20]: I understand.

02:41:25.932 --> 02:41:26.652
[SPEAKER_20]: But, uh...

02:41:27.699 --> 02:41:29.540
[SPEAKER_20]: Too bad all those people aren't still in town, though.

02:41:29.920 --> 02:41:31.261
[SPEAKER_20]: I bet they'd love to see me now.

02:41:31.801 --> 02:41:32.541
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm fabulous.

02:41:33.061 --> 02:41:33.301
[SPEAKER_02]: What?

02:41:33.462 --> 02:41:34.402
[SPEAKER_02]: Most of them are, actually.

02:41:34.422 --> 02:41:35.923
[SPEAKER_02]: Most of them didn't actually leave town.

02:41:36.203 --> 02:41:36.583
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh, really?

02:41:36.603 --> 02:41:38.264
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh, we should all hang out or something.

02:41:38.724 --> 02:41:39.424
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to try.

02:41:39.964 --> 02:41:42.806
[SPEAKER_21]: But, uh... I'm a little different than I was in high school.

02:41:43.166 --> 02:41:43.346
[SPEAKER_02]: Nah.

02:41:43.526 --> 02:41:47.087
[SPEAKER_02]: I never would have guessed.

02:41:47.188 --> 02:41:49.769
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, your flame's showing.

02:41:50.049 --> 02:41:50.629
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh, sorry.

02:41:52.350 --> 02:41:54.991
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh... F you to the barrier, DJ.

02:41:55.011 --> 02:41:56.211
[SPEAKER_02]: You're so damn far away.

02:41:56.912 --> 02:41:57.252
[SPEAKER_29]: Yeah.

02:41:57.771 --> 02:41:58.231
[SPEAKER_29]: Agreed.

02:41:58.511 --> 02:42:00.893
[SPEAKER_20]: I still want to know about this naked hot tubbing stuff.

02:42:02.734 --> 02:42:03.814
[SPEAKER_21]: Whose place was this at?

02:42:04.294 --> 02:42:06.776
[SPEAKER_21]: I can't tell you.

02:42:06.856 --> 02:42:07.756
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay, alright, fine.

02:42:08.597 --> 02:42:12.238
[SPEAKER_02]: There was a dual G5 Power Mac involved, too.

02:42:13.139 --> 02:42:14.219
[SPEAKER_21]: Power Mac, okay.

02:42:15.520 --> 02:42:15.900
[SPEAKER_21]: Hot.

02:42:15.920 --> 02:42:17.481
[SPEAKER_21]: Alright.

02:42:18.702 --> 02:42:19.122
[SPEAKER_21]: Fair enough.

02:42:19.982 --> 02:42:22.984
[SPEAKER_02]: And, well, of course, the usual FUs to kill viruses.

02:42:23.764 --> 02:42:23.944
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay.

02:42:24.044 --> 02:42:26.465
[SPEAKER_02]: And not enough time in the fucking week.

02:42:29.706 --> 02:42:30.406
[SPEAKER_21]: Fair enough.

02:42:31.047 --> 02:42:32.128
[SPEAKER_21]: Alright, explicit.

02:42:35.291 --> 02:42:43.218
[SPEAKER_26]: I want to give an FD to some white Ford Mustang for trying to run my ass over when it says walk on my part.

02:42:43.438 --> 02:42:53.347
[SPEAKER_26]: When I'm walking in the pedestrian... No, I should not be run over just because you're in a damn hurry running 60 miles an hour and turning right on a red lane.

02:42:54.028 --> 02:42:54.689
[SPEAKER_26]: My god, I...

02:42:56.750 --> 02:43:02.032
[SPEAKER_26]: and FU2 and Zuma469 for causing a shitload of drama on the tournament, obviously.

02:43:03.453 --> 02:43:06.895
[SPEAKER_26]: If you don't like the rules, don't even go to the tournaments.

02:43:07.235 --> 02:43:09.776
[SPEAKER_26]: You send us to numerous tournaments and we're getting sick of it.

02:43:10.616 --> 02:43:16.999
[SPEAKER_26]: You bring your drama, personal drama, that Team469 shouldn't even be involved, and you bring it in front of our faces.

02:43:17.600 --> 02:43:18.280
[SPEAKER_26]: Look what happens.

02:43:18.940 --> 02:43:19.801
[SPEAKER_26]: Now you're banned.

02:43:20.721 --> 02:43:21.922
[SPEAKER_26]: Luckily we did not kick your ass.

02:43:24.255 --> 02:43:27.779
[SPEAKER_26]: I want to give an F you for my video card from frying up like shit.

02:43:29.942 --> 02:43:34.667
[SPEAKER_26]: Somehow, like, I think I started smelling smoke on my video card for Radeon 9800.

02:43:34.747 --> 02:43:39.353
[SPEAKER_26]: I still have to fix the problem, but if I can't fix it, I have to...

02:43:40.533 --> 02:43:54.718
[SPEAKER_26]: and FU2 whoever turned off my fucking firewall, now I got a fucking virus I can't even delete until I do some very good research towards it, because not even Adaware or any of those other programs could even check it out.

02:43:57.179 --> 02:44:04.322
[SPEAKER_26]: FU2, whoever was spreading a fucking rumor about my family and stuff, that someone said that one of our family members hate each other, you know how much

02:44:05.183 --> 02:44:09.084
[SPEAKER_26]: The pain that is for the family if someone ever hears that type of shit.

02:44:10.324 --> 02:44:13.445
[SPEAKER_26]: It hurts, a lot of tears have been going through that type of issue.

02:44:15.366 --> 02:44:19.127
[SPEAKER_26]: But luckily everything is solved and whoever said that type of shit should be killed.

02:44:19.147 --> 02:44:20.927
[SPEAKER_26]: Most likely, honestly.

02:44:21.708 --> 02:44:31.970
[SPEAKER_26]: FU2 being broke as hell because I spent a lot of money and now I owe like some people for the tournament since that's what some people say like the tournament got rigged over prizes.

02:44:32.791 --> 02:44:33.731
[SPEAKER_26]: Get the fuck over it.

02:44:34.750 --> 02:44:39.813
[SPEAKER_26]: and a few to losing a shitload of money on Friday at Thunder Valley Casino on Blackjack.

02:44:40.734 --> 02:44:41.594
[SPEAKER_17]: That was me last week.

02:44:43.415 --> 02:44:44.256
[SPEAKER_17]: Except not Blackjack.

02:44:45.857 --> 02:44:50.540
[SPEAKER_26]: Well, in the fact, yeah, I lost fucking 90 bucks over fucking Blackjack itself.

02:44:51.800 --> 02:44:53.721
[SPEAKER_26]: Some people can't even play fucking Blackjack pretty well.

02:44:53.741 --> 02:44:55.462
[SPEAKER_26]: They hit them when they're not supposed to hit.

02:44:56.707 --> 02:45:00.169
[SPEAKER_26]: Okay, if you see a six on the field, you're not supposed to fucking hit.

02:45:00.569 --> 02:45:03.870
[SPEAKER_26]: You're supposed to leave it to stay because they know the dealer is in trouble.

02:45:04.451 --> 02:45:05.771
[SPEAKER_26]: You hit and they give you 21.

02:45:06.011 --> 02:45:06.952
[SPEAKER_26]: You get fucked over.

02:45:07.332 --> 02:45:07.972
[SPEAKER_26]: Thanks a lot.

02:45:09.273 --> 02:45:12.574
[SPEAKER_26]: And since it is a three-hour show, I want to say to be continued.

02:45:13.495 --> 02:45:17.837
[SPEAKER_26]: My angst will never... Alright, alright.

02:45:19.958 --> 02:45:25.300
[SPEAKER_20]: Alright, let's move on to the next segment, which would be the chatroom FUs.

02:45:28.566 --> 02:45:48.467
[SPEAKER_20]: starting it off with MPQ in order of severity F you to the laggy broadcast F you to myself for inadvertently reformatting my hard drive twice in a week F you to my parents for losing the wireless network password and F you to my little sister for drawing on my laptop with a permanent marker dope

02:45:50.017 --> 02:45:57.545
[SPEAKER_20]: DarkKnight says, I think this might be a running FU, but FU to Valentine's Day and being broke and single and having to work on Valentine's Day.

02:45:58.847 --> 02:46:10.079
[SPEAKER_20]: Zaku says, FU to being worried about getting work, FU to Valentine's Day for being so discriminating to singles, and FU to having to wait until I'm employed so that I can buy the Bomani hardware I desire.

02:46:11.514 --> 02:46:13.616
[SPEAKER_20]: Illusion says F you to Valentine's Day.

02:46:13.756 --> 02:46:18.539
[SPEAKER_20]: Okay, I've got two girls that were in love with me, but they tell me this after they get a boyfriend.

02:46:18.559 --> 02:46:19.120
[SPEAKER_20]: What the fuck?

02:46:19.500 --> 02:46:25.985
[SPEAKER_20]: Anyway, I'm going to drown my Valentine's sorrow in a big tub of chocolate ice cream and multiple viewings of When Harry Met Sally.

02:46:28.927 --> 02:46:39.474
[SPEAKER_20]: VXJasonXV and Rychan, since they're together in the same place right now, you know, they said, I guess we could say F you to anyone in advance that F you's Valentine's Day.

02:46:43.129 --> 02:46:44.350
[SPEAKER_20]: Ouch, it's a clarin war there.

02:46:45.971 --> 02:46:51.893
[SPEAKER_20]: RPGKing7 says, if you do get this FU, an FU to all the employers that won't hire me.

02:46:52.013 --> 02:46:56.075
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm desperate for a job, but not male gigolo desperate.

02:46:57.416 --> 02:47:01.298
[SPEAKER_20]: And an FU to losing all my PlayStation 2 data, and to Valentine's Day.

02:47:05.219 --> 02:47:10.642
[SPEAKER_20]: StepEdOff1215 says, FU to constantly being broke and never being able to get anything I want.

02:47:13.255 --> 02:47:19.882
[SPEAKER_20]: and Lama Juice says, F you to Red Octane for losing my order for my metal pad that I waited the two months for.

02:47:21.624 --> 02:47:25.569
[SPEAKER_20]: And to Microsoft, because my Xbox isn't reading discs anymore.

02:47:29.433 --> 02:47:32.376
[SPEAKER_20]: And Dork says, F you to Valentine's Day and girls.

02:47:32.556 --> 02:47:34.078
[SPEAKER_20]: Insert frowny face here.

02:47:35.353 --> 02:47:41.356
[SPEAKER_20]: Oh, I think that was a bit of a recurring theme there tonight, the FU to Valentine's Day.

02:47:41.816 --> 02:47:42.016
[SPEAKER_20]: Yes?

02:47:42.256 --> 02:47:45.377
[SPEAKER_30]: Hugs to DK, because that's not cool.

02:47:45.597 --> 02:47:45.857
[SPEAKER_30]: Oh, well.

02:47:45.957 --> 02:47:46.578
[SPEAKER_20]: What, just him?

02:47:48.118 --> 02:47:48.699
[SPEAKER_20]: I know, I know.

02:47:48.719 --> 02:47:51.200
[SPEAKER_20]: A lot of people are sad about Valentine's Day, though.

02:47:51.900 --> 02:47:53.100
[SPEAKER_30]: Okay, hugs to you, too, then.

02:47:53.460 --> 02:47:54.161
[SPEAKER_30]: There, better?

02:47:54.641 --> 02:47:54.901
[SPEAKER_20]: Much.

02:47:55.221 --> 02:47:55.521
[SPEAKER_30]: Okay.

02:47:56.522 --> 02:47:56.822
[SPEAKER_20]: All right.

02:47:58.803 --> 02:47:59.383
[SPEAKER_20]: Let's see.

02:47:59.503 --> 02:48:01.064
[SPEAKER_20]: When the hell is that you're watching, Loki?

02:48:01.084 --> 02:48:03.705
[SPEAKER_20]: It looks like some public access production of Superman.

02:48:03.725 --> 02:48:04.205
[SPEAKER_20]: What is this?

02:48:05.546 --> 02:48:06.666
[SPEAKER_19]: It's the world's finest.

02:48:06.766 --> 02:48:12.868
[SPEAKER_19]: It's a fan-made trailer for a movie that doesn't exist.

02:48:14.309 --> 02:48:14.649
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't know.

02:48:16.150 --> 02:48:18.810
[SPEAKER_20]: Where do people get the time to do that, seriously?

02:48:19.351 --> 02:48:24.212
[SPEAKER_20]: I mean, I guess, then again, this is coming from a guy who co-hosts a three-hour internet show dedicated to video games.

02:48:24.973 --> 02:48:28.894
[SPEAKER_19]: Well, this guy's actually trying to get himself, you know, work.

02:48:29.614 --> 02:48:32.395
[SPEAKER_19]: It's a director that does the stuff, and he's done the same ones.

02:48:32.415 --> 02:48:34.856
[SPEAKER_19]: He did another one called Batman Dead End, which was...

02:48:36.027 --> 02:48:37.888
[SPEAKER_19]: Batman vs. Alien vs. Predator.

02:48:38.268 --> 02:48:38.928
[SPEAKER_19]: It's a little short.

02:48:39.028 --> 02:48:40.309
[SPEAKER_19]: It was really well done.

02:48:40.649 --> 02:48:46.291
[SPEAKER_20]: That was the one that was really cool in the beginning, and then when it was Predator-fied, I was like, this is gay.

02:48:48.132 --> 02:48:52.434
[SPEAKER_19]: They did another one called Grayson, too, which is supposed to be like Robin stuff.

02:48:52.554 --> 02:48:53.354
[SPEAKER_19]: It looks cool.

02:48:53.534 --> 02:48:55.275
[SPEAKER_19]: I mean, they have pretty cool people.

02:48:56.956 --> 02:48:58.396
[SPEAKER_19]: It's better than your average fan film.

02:48:58.436 --> 02:48:59.077
[SPEAKER_19]: Let's just put that one.

02:48:59.537 --> 02:48:59.997
[SPEAKER_19]: But anyways, yeah.

02:49:02.717 --> 02:49:03.277
[SPEAKER_20]: Interesting.

02:49:03.397 --> 02:49:04.358
[SPEAKER_20]: Where can you download that?

02:49:04.838 --> 02:49:06.359
[SPEAKER_20]: Is that like an Ain't It Cool News thing?

02:49:07.159 --> 02:49:10.601
[SPEAKER_19]: I believe TheForce.net has links to these.

02:49:10.821 --> 02:49:14.983
[SPEAKER_19]: They have like a fan film link for like other stuff.

02:49:15.183 --> 02:49:24.427
[SPEAKER_19]: You can also get some weird Matrix ones too, but like another one that's pretty cool is Matrix Run Program, I think is the name of that one.

02:49:24.847 --> 02:49:26.248
[SPEAKER_19]: That was pretty well done too.

02:49:28.464 --> 02:49:37.910
[SPEAKER_20]: So this director's trying to find work, so what he does is he wastes tons of money making these fake-ass trailers for movies so that internet nerds can get big boners over them.

02:49:37.970 --> 02:49:38.490
[SPEAKER_20]: Is that correct?

02:49:38.830 --> 02:49:39.591
[SPEAKER_20]: Except explicit.

02:49:40.912 --> 02:49:41.532
[SPEAKER_19]: Exactly.

02:49:43.673 --> 02:49:43.993
[SPEAKER_20]: Alright.

02:49:45.374 --> 02:49:45.875
[SPEAKER_20]: Interesting.

02:49:46.335 --> 02:49:51.238
[SPEAKER_20]: Alright, we're going to take a quick break, and then when we come back, we're going to wrap things up.

02:49:51.818 --> 02:49:53.879
[SPEAKER_20]: And please keep your boners secured at all times.

02:49:54.300 --> 02:49:54.460
[SPEAKER_20]: Yep.

02:49:54.780 --> 02:49:57.542
[SPEAKER_20]: And then there might be a few other surprises when we come back from break.

02:49:57.562 --> 02:49:57.802
[SPEAKER_20]: We'll see.

02:49:59.363 --> 02:49:59.923
[SPEAKER_20]: But no boners.

02:50:00.364 --> 02:50:01.625
[SPEAKER_20]: So, yes, Loki.

02:50:02.246 --> 02:50:08.232
[SPEAKER_19]: I mean, these would, I mean, obviously they're not theatrical quality, but I could definitely see this being like a TV movie or something.

02:50:08.252 --> 02:50:10.634
[SPEAKER_19]: They really should let this guy make movies.

02:50:11.215 --> 02:50:12.617
[SPEAKER_19]: Because I think they'd be pretty decent.

02:50:12.797 --> 02:50:15.460
[SPEAKER_19]: I mean, they'd be better than like, you know, Lois and Clark and stuff.

02:50:16.761 --> 02:50:18.583
[SPEAKER_20]: I don't think they should let this guy ever make a movie.

02:50:20.391 --> 02:50:26.215
[SPEAKER_19]: They let the guy that made, what was it, Uwe Boll or whatever his name is Okay, they let him make movies, why not this guy?

02:50:26.515 --> 02:50:46.669
[SPEAKER_20]: Because I would rather Uwe Boll make movies than this guy Because if this guy actually gets a deal and actually gets to make a movie Every freaking person on the internet will be turning out crap trying to imitate this So sorry dude, but I hope it doesn't work No comments to that, Loki?

02:50:47.779 --> 02:50:49.802
[SPEAKER_19]: That was completely and utterly retarded.

02:50:50.444 --> 02:50:51.025
[SPEAKER_19]: Your idea.

02:50:51.145 --> 02:50:51.666
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm sorry.

02:50:53.208 --> 02:50:53.789
[SPEAKER_20]: Ah, suck it.

02:50:53.869 --> 02:50:55.031
[SPEAKER_20]: Alright, we're going to go to a break.

02:50:55.813 --> 02:50:56.313
[SPEAKER_20]: We'll be back.

02:50:56.654 --> 02:50:59.459
[SPEAKER_20]: I thought we could do some disco tunes in this break, so we'll be back after this.

02:51:59.106 --> 02:51:59.502
[SPEAKER_14]: Thanks for watching!

02:52:36.738 --> 02:52:43.101
I am gonna stand my ground, nothing in the world's gonna bring me down.

02:52:43.361 --> 02:52:50.765
Hear me yell and hear me roar, I am something that you can't ignore.

02:52:51.185 --> 02:52:59.089
I am here for all of us, I am this and we're all that we want.

02:53:02.289 --> 02:53:03.550
DJ Ranma S, Actdeft

02:53:30.531 --> 02:53:35.475
Gaming Radio, so uncensored, uncensored.

02:54:00.928 --> 02:54:05.452
[SPEAKER_10]: and even Tom Brokaw could get a job with us.

02:54:05.612 --> 02:54:06.973
[SPEAKER_10]: Orange Lounge Radio.

02:54:10.295 --> 02:54:12.657
[SPEAKER_20]: We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio.

02:54:14.218 --> 02:54:15.299
[SPEAKER_20]: About to wrap stuff up.

02:54:15.900 --> 02:54:24.086
[SPEAKER_20]: But you know, when we get towards the end of the show and we're running out of things to talk about, we always turn to the DDR community to find us some inspiration.

02:54:24.526 --> 02:54:28.910
[SPEAKER_20]: And of course, we like to head on over to the biggest DDR site out there,

02:54:29.454 --> 02:54:36.716
[SPEAKER_20]: TheDDRFreak.com And we like to find ourselves the DDR Freak Post of the Week.

02:54:36.796 --> 02:54:39.237
[SPEAKER_20]: So we're going to look at our DDR Chit Chat Post of the Week.

02:54:45.799 --> 02:54:47.319
[SPEAKER_20]: It was actually Slim Pickens this week.

02:54:47.360 --> 02:54:50.040
[SPEAKER_20]: There was really not a whole lot of newbie posts.

02:54:50.100 --> 02:54:52.681
[SPEAKER_20]: I mean, there was some, but nothing that hilarious.

02:54:52.721 --> 02:54:54.982
[SPEAKER_20]: So this was hard for me to make a determination.

02:54:55.002 --> 02:54:56.922
[SPEAKER_20]: But I did decide on this post here.

02:54:57.743 --> 02:54:58.503
[SPEAKER_20]: This is a post...

02:54:59.315 --> 02:55:05.658
[SPEAKER_20]: and it's called American Songs Are Wrecking DDR.

02:55:06.238 --> 02:55:07.059
[SPEAKER_20]: And the post goes like this.

02:55:07.759 --> 02:55:13.122
[SPEAKER_20]: Whose idea was it to put songs made by Cher and Madonna in DDR?

02:55:13.722 --> 02:55:16.443
[SPEAKER_20]: Unless you're a housewife, these songs gotta go.

02:55:17.744 --> 02:55:22.326
[SPEAKER_20]: They didn't put Max Period in Extreme US and I didn't think they were making DDR anymore.

02:55:23.038 --> 02:55:23.799
[SPEAKER_20]: I got a question.

02:55:43.669 --> 02:55:46.691
[SPEAKER_26]: Doesn't really matter if a song is like 300 beats p.m.

02:55:46.751 --> 02:55:47.172
[SPEAKER_26]: or more.

02:55:47.192 --> 02:55:55.578
[SPEAKER_26]: Because honestly, everyone who complains about this wants a Max song in it or Paranoia Survivor, Paranoia Survivor Max into any of the U.S.

02:55:55.598 --> 02:55:56.199
[SPEAKER_26]: releases.

02:55:56.939 --> 02:56:03.724
[SPEAKER_26]: Of course, everyone knows there's no Paranoia Survivor or Survivor Max in like Vulture Mix or the New York Stream series.

02:56:04.024 --> 02:56:08.668
[SPEAKER_19]: Hell, Paranoia Survivor and Survivor Max are just sped up versions of the other song.

02:56:09.208 --> 02:56:09.649
[SPEAKER_19]: Woo!

02:56:09.749 --> 02:56:11.050
[SPEAKER_19]: Paranoia Survivor and woo!

02:56:11.090 --> 02:56:12.391
[SPEAKER_19]: Paranoia Survivor Max!

02:56:13.180 --> 02:56:15.221
[SPEAKER_19]: which is a sped up version of the song.

02:56:16.401 --> 02:56:17.961
[SPEAKER_19]: Wow, that took a lot of work there.

02:56:18.981 --> 02:56:19.902
[SPEAKER_19]: See, that's what's sad.

02:56:20.322 --> 02:56:26.883
[SPEAKER_19]: People, you know, they probably look at these people playing SimFiles and they're like, hey, they like Max 600, it's just sped up Max 300.

02:56:27.864 --> 02:56:29.404
[SPEAKER_19]: Let's do that with Paranoia Survivor.

02:56:29.424 --> 02:56:31.105
[SPEAKER_19]: We have two songs for the price of one.

02:56:32.505 --> 02:56:33.125
[SPEAKER_20]: Exactly.

02:56:34.325 --> 02:56:40.947
[SPEAKER_20]: I don't know about you guys, but I think DDR is all about fun and trying to play Sakura heavy on a homepad is not fun.

02:56:42.253 --> 02:57:02.852
[SPEAKER_26]: Dancing around to Cher and Madonna, fun I mean, I don't mind about the song list, but some people just have to get a grip that a mix is not going to have all ten footers Rob, that's just the gay in you, saying that Hey, I like a lot of songs in DDR, not just the gay ones

02:57:06.700 --> 02:57:07.620
[SPEAKER_20]: Angel, your thoughts.

02:57:07.641 --> 02:57:09.082
[SPEAKER_20]: Do you have any thoughts on this one?

02:57:09.522 --> 02:57:09.682
[SPEAKER_20]: No?

02:57:09.762 --> 02:57:10.343
[SPEAKER_20]: She's shaking her head.

02:57:11.304 --> 02:57:11.584
[SPEAKER_20]: Okay.

02:57:12.685 --> 02:57:13.926
[SPEAKER_20]: Instead, she's giving me candy.

02:57:13.966 --> 02:57:14.947
[SPEAKER_20]: Ooh, that's a very good thing.

02:57:15.007 --> 02:57:15.607
[SPEAKER_20]: I like candy.

02:57:15.868 --> 02:57:17.129
[SPEAKER_20]: Candy's a good way to make me happy.

02:57:17.409 --> 02:57:19.230
[SPEAKER_20]: These little, like, they look like Pringles, but they're not.

02:57:19.251 --> 02:57:20.311
[SPEAKER_20]: They're little chocolate chip things.

02:57:20.772 --> 02:57:21.152
[SPEAKER_20]: Swoops?

02:57:21.232 --> 02:57:21.813
[SPEAKER_20]: Is that what they're called?

02:57:22.413 --> 02:57:23.935
[SPEAKER_26]: Yeah, I mean, yeah.

02:57:24.135 --> 02:57:33.323
[SPEAKER_26]: Like, related to my question, like, would anybody buy a mix that had 70 paranoias and 10 maxes all in just one package?

02:57:33.443 --> 02:57:33.663
[SPEAKER_26]: Yeah.

02:57:35.563 --> 02:57:36.343
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes, I might.

02:57:37.744 --> 02:57:44.025
[SPEAKER_20]: Because honestly... Seriously, why don't we release a home mix?

02:57:44.085 --> 02:57:45.325
[SPEAKER_20]: These are the songs we'll put in it.

02:57:45.345 --> 02:57:51.707
[SPEAKER_20]: We'll put Max Period, Paranoia Survivor Max, the Max 300 mix from Ultramix 2.

02:57:52.127 --> 02:57:52.507
[SPEAKER_20]: You know what?

02:57:52.547 --> 02:57:52.927
[SPEAKER_20]: Fuck it.

02:57:52.967 --> 02:57:58.528
[SPEAKER_20]: We'll just license a whole bunch of Nine Inch Nails and Crystal Method and all these really fast groups that do fast songs.

02:57:58.548 --> 02:58:02.109
[SPEAKER_20]: We'll license all their tracks and we'll put it in a home mix and we'll call...

02:58:02.987 --> 02:58:06.370
[SPEAKER_20]: Good fucking luck, Mix, playing this on your fucking homepad.

02:58:07.871 --> 02:58:14.557
[SPEAKER_26]: Or they could just do, infuse the song like everybody, does it be my style, Max Dinosaur or 1, 2, 3, 4, Max 300.

02:58:14.877 --> 02:58:20.241
[SPEAKER_20]: And then we'll call it, I hope you own a fucking Cobalt Flux, Mix.

02:58:20.481 --> 02:58:23.084
[SPEAKER_20]: Seriously, because that's the only way you're going to pass any of this shit.

02:58:24.365 --> 02:58:25.846
[SPEAKER_20]: Or DDR Controller, Mix.

02:58:26.767 --> 02:58:28.068
[SPEAKER_20]: Button, Button Revolution.

02:58:28.328 --> 02:58:29.289
[SPEAKER_26]: Rape, Rape Revolution.

02:58:30.189 --> 02:58:30.850
[SPEAKER_26]: How rapey that is.

02:58:31.235 --> 02:58:32.916
[SPEAKER_20]: or America's Beatmania.

02:58:36.278 --> 02:58:37.639
[SPEAKER_20]: There you go.

02:58:38.240 --> 02:58:41.382
[SPEAKER_20]: You guys that wanted a Beatmania USA, there you go.

02:58:41.422 --> 02:58:45.344
[SPEAKER_20]: They're just going to release a DDR mix and have nothing but 10s and 11s in it.

02:58:45.484 --> 02:58:47.025
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah, they'll have 11-footers in it now.

02:58:47.265 --> 02:58:48.946
[SPEAKER_20]: And they'll call it Beatmania USA.

02:58:49.387 --> 02:58:49.807
[SPEAKER_20]: There it is.

02:58:50.868 --> 02:58:51.568
[SPEAKER_26]: Problem solved.

02:58:53.329 --> 02:58:53.709
[SPEAKER_26]: In a way.

02:58:57.068 --> 02:59:01.352
[SPEAKER_20]: Anyway, I think that's going to do it for tonight's episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

02:59:02.132 --> 02:59:05.275
[SPEAKER_20]: So now we're going to go around and get everybody's final thought.

02:59:06.415 --> 02:59:07.856
[SPEAKER_20]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

02:59:28.969 --> 02:59:32.712
[SPEAKER_20]: and I would urge you to read through the instructions on our website.

02:59:32.732 --> 02:59:38.856
[SPEAKER_20]: If that's one of you, if you mark that answer, read through the instructions on our website under the Orange Lounge Radio To Go edition page.

02:59:38.956 --> 02:59:39.816
[SPEAKER_20]: It's really easy.

02:59:40.236 --> 02:59:44.879
[SPEAKER_20]: All you got to do is download a program called iPotter and you can get this at what?

02:59:44.960 --> 02:59:50.483
[SPEAKER_20]: It's just iPotter.sourceforge.net or even just put it into like Google, do a search for it.

02:59:50.823 --> 02:59:56.307
[SPEAKER_20]: It's really easy to find and then it gives you like a window in there where you put in a URL just like a web browser.

02:59:56.667 --> 02:59:57.568
[SPEAKER_20]: Put in our URL.

02:59:57.668 --> 02:59:58.849
[SPEAKER_20]: It is super, super easy.

02:59:58.989 --> 03:00:04.593
[SPEAKER_20]: Again, you do not need an iPod or any type of portable MP3 device to listen to the show.

03:00:04.653 --> 03:00:09.516
[SPEAKER_20]: They only call it a podcast because it sounds cute and iPods happen to be popular.

03:00:09.896 --> 03:00:10.997
[SPEAKER_20]: You don't need one.

03:00:11.337 --> 03:00:11.637
[SPEAKER_20]: Loki.

03:00:12.278 --> 03:00:17.281
[SPEAKER_19]: I did find one of the songs that could be on that, you know, good fucking luck mix.

03:00:18.582 --> 03:00:19.583
[SPEAKER_19]: Berserker, Reality.

03:00:24.166 --> 03:00:25.067
[SPEAKER_19]: What the fuck?

03:00:26.019 --> 03:00:31.202
[SPEAKER_19]: And sadly enough, that is the same file that you've found on BomaniStyle.com.

03:00:31.262 --> 03:00:34.224
[SPEAKER_26]: I've seen a lot of realities, I just don't download them.

03:00:34.324 --> 03:00:36.566
[SPEAKER_20]: You know what, and we'll just let DM Ashura do all the music.

03:00:40.148 --> 03:00:48.433
[SPEAKER_20]: And then, you know what, DM Ashura will do all the music, and then, who's that kid that does all the crazy-ass Oni steps?

03:00:48.593 --> 03:00:48.754
[SPEAKER_20]: He's

03:00:49.892 --> 03:00:50.292
[SPEAKER_20]: NakedHotTubbing

03:01:20.310 --> 03:01:21.491
[SPEAKER_20]: Explicit, your final thought.

03:01:21.972 --> 03:01:25.655
[SPEAKER_26]: I survived the anti-boner Lent so far.

03:01:26.156 --> 03:01:26.576
[SPEAKER_20]: So far.

03:01:26.596 --> 03:01:29.199
[SPEAKER_26]: So don't send me any more porn or anything like that.

03:01:29.379 --> 03:01:30.420
[SPEAKER_20]: And what is your email address?

03:01:31.141 --> 03:01:31.321
[SPEAKER_20]: Huh?

03:01:32.001 --> 03:01:32.822
[SPEAKER_20]: What is your email address?

03:01:33.483 --> 03:01:38.588
[SPEAKER_26]: Explicitalpha at yahoo.com Just look up his profile on DDR3.

03:01:39.128 --> 03:01:39.989
[SPEAKER_20]: Angel, your final thought.

03:01:40.830 --> 03:01:44.273
[SPEAKER_30]: Need more time in a week to play Final Fantasy XI.

03:01:44.293 --> 03:01:44.533
[SPEAKER_30]: Yeah.

03:01:44.854 --> 03:01:45.014
[SPEAKER_30]: Yeah.

03:01:46.894 --> 03:01:50.997
[SPEAKER_20]: My final thought is... I don't want to go back to work tomorrow.

03:01:51.057 --> 03:01:55.220
[SPEAKER_20]: And tomorrow's Valentine's Day and it's going to suck because everybody's going to have flowers and shit.

03:01:55.260 --> 03:01:56.281
[SPEAKER_20]: And I don't have that stuff.

03:01:56.942 --> 03:01:57.742
[SPEAKER_20]: Loki, your final thought.

03:01:59.804 --> 03:02:01.585
[SPEAKER_19]: I know I'm clicking and I don't care.

03:02:03.767 --> 03:02:09.651
[SPEAKER_19]: No, my final thought is... I don't want to have to return this fucking battery.

03:02:10.492 --> 03:02:11.152
[SPEAKER_19]: Sucks.

03:02:11.773 --> 03:02:11.152
$200.

03:02:14.815 --> 03:02:16.236
[SPEAKER_20]: And the final word of the show...

03:02:16.823 --> 03:02:18.704
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm going to give the final word of the show to Loki.

03:02:18.944 --> 03:02:20.665
[SPEAKER_20]: Loki, one word to sum it all up tonight.

03:02:23.686 --> 03:02:24.147
[SPEAKER_08]: Bacon!

03:02:25.667 --> 03:02:30.530
[SPEAKER_08]: That does it for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio Live.

03:02:31.350 --> 03:02:35.572

[SPEAKER_00]: And now, today's Ebonics language lesson.

03:02:55.200 --> 03:02:55.940
[SPEAKER_00]: Meeting girls.

03:02:56.720 --> 03:02:58.621
[SPEAKER_00]: My, you're a lovely young lady.

03:02:59.341 --> 03:03:01.002
[SPEAKER_23]: Damn, you's a fine mother******.

03:03:01.982 --> 03:03:04.023
[SPEAKER_00]: Damn, you's a fine mother******.

03:03:05.424 --> 03:03:07.045
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's go for a ride, shall we?

03:03:07.665 --> 03:03:10.426
[SPEAKER_23]: Hey baby, jump in my little ride and let's rotate these ties.

03:03:11.112 --> 03:03:15.094
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, baby, let's jump in my lowrider and let's rotate these tires.

03:03:16.155 --> 03:03:17.055
[SPEAKER_00]: You are beautiful.

03:03:17.515 --> 03:03:18.836
[SPEAKER_00]: I would like to make love to you.

03:03:19.556 --> 03:03:21.517
[SPEAKER_23]: Damn, bitch, you stupid fly.

03:03:21.978 --> 03:03:24.419
[SPEAKER_23]: Let me pull up to that bumper and smack that monkey.

03:03:25.039 --> 03:03:26.960
[SPEAKER_00]: Damn, bitch, you stupid fly.

03:03:27.340 --> 03:03:29.902
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me pull up to your bumper and smack that monkey.

03:03:30.802 --> 03:03:31.883
[SPEAKER_00]: Greeting old friends.

03:03:32.663 --> 03:03:33.263
[SPEAKER_00]: Hello, sir.

03:03:33.964 --> 03:03:35.324
[SPEAKER_14]: What up, dog?

03:03:36.145 --> 03:03:37.666
[SPEAKER_00]: What up, dog?

03:03:38.906 --> 03:03:40.167
[SPEAKER_00]: May I borrow some money?

03:03:40.874 --> 03:03:42.154
[SPEAKER_23]: Hey, let me hold some ends.

03:03:42.234 --> 03:03:43.995
[SPEAKER_23]: I hit you back on the first, my brother.

03:03:44.535 --> 03:03:45.956
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, let me hold some ends.

03:03:46.156 --> 03:03:48.456
[SPEAKER_00]: I will hit you back on the first, my brother.

03:03:49.777 --> 03:03:50.477
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have it?

03:03:50.897 --> 03:03:51.678
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks anyway.

03:03:52.518 --> 03:03:53.318
[SPEAKER_23]: F*** you.

03:03:54.198 --> 03:03:54.919
[SPEAKER_00]: F*** you.

03:03:56.079 --> 03:03:57.059
[SPEAKER_00]: Making new friends.

03:03:57.699 --> 03:03:58.320
[SPEAKER_00]: Hello, sir.

03:03:58.940 --> 03:03:59.460
[SPEAKER_23]: What up?

03:04:00.160 --> 03:04:00.620
[SPEAKER_00]: What up?

03:04:01.981 --> 03:04:04.422
[SPEAKER_00]: I admire your fashionable running shoes.

03:04:05.042 --> 03:04:08.463
[SPEAKER_23]: Drop them Nikes off your ass before I blast you, mother f***er.

03:04:09.096 --> 03:04:12.738
[SPEAKER_00]: Drop them Nikes off your ass before I blast you, mother****.

03:04:14.039 --> 03:04:16.601
[SPEAKER_00]: I used to be a stuck-up white boy, faking the funk.

03:04:17.041 --> 03:04:17.661
[SPEAKER_00]: Bump that.

03:04:18.302 --> 03:04:24.166
[SPEAKER_00]: I ain't bull**** on Front Street no more, thanks to the Wake Up Crew's Ebonics language lesson.

03:04:25.466 --> 03:04:27.268
[SPEAKER_00]: Available in a hood near you.

03:04:30.530 --> 03:04:34.032
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you very much for listening, and we'll see you next week.

03:04:54.212 --> 03:04:56.913
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you very much boys and girls for tuning in tonight and listening to us.

03:04:56.993 --> 03:04:57.954
[SPEAKER_20]: We do appreciate it.

03:04:58.274 --> 03:05:04.496
[SPEAKER_20]: We're now going to go back to our Bomani Music and More program featuring all your DDR, 2DX, and Dance Mania favorites.

03:05:05.036 --> 03:05:06.917
[SPEAKER_20]: Again, thanks bunches and bunches for listening.

03:05:07.457 --> 03:05:11.639
[SPEAKER_20]: And we hope to see you guys back here next week for more Orange Lounge Radio.

03:05:11.659 --> 03:05:12.840
[SPEAKER_20]: Don't forget about our podcast too.

03:05:12.960 --> 03:05:13.480
[SPEAKER_20]: It's very cool.
