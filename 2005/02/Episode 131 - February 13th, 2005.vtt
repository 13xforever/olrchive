08:58.600 --> 09:03.600
I need someone to stay in the car

09:03.600 --> 09:06.600

09:06.600 --> 09:10.600
But you'll give me what it takes

09:10.600 --> 09:19.600
Don't you need to make someone to be on the phone

09:19.600 --> 09:21.600
You

09:21.600 --> 09:42.800
Love, I just gotta have it, I believe in love, so let it go

09:42.800 --> 09:46.800
Surprised it finally happened to me

09:49.800 --> 09:54.800
Now I've realized this was a love from me

09:56.800 --> 10:00.800
Cause when we dance together

10:00.800 --> 10:04.800
You're like a dream come true

10:04.800 --> 10:07.800
I feel so beautiful

10:07.800 --> 10:12.800
What's inside is all those of you

10:12.800 --> 10:18.800
Love, I just gotta have it I believe in love

10:18.800 --> 10:24.800
I can't be without it Come to me and make your confession

10:24.800 --> 10:30.800
Love, come let it go Love, I just gotta have it

10:30.800 --> 10:36.800
I believe in love I can't be without it

10:36.800 --> 10:40.240
Come to me and make your confession

10:40.240 --> 10:44.240
Love, who let it go?

11:10.240 --> 11:25.240
Sometimes I am thinking of being too blind

11:25.240 --> 11:33.240
Sometimes I'm too close to what I have to be

11:33.240 --> 11:38.240
So I feel a friction line

11:38.240 --> 11:41.240
So I do it myself

11:41.240 --> 11:46.240
And I can't wait for my memories

11:46.240 --> 11:48.240
To come to my life

11:49.240 --> 11:53.240
I call you, I need you

11:53.240 --> 11:57.240
I want to be your love

11:57.240 --> 12:00.240
I gave you my touch

12:00.240 --> 12:04.240
I gave you all my life

12:04.240 --> 12:08.240
I lie here, I call you

12:08.240 --> 12:12.240
I live for you all my life

12:12.240 --> 12:20.240
I always need to be with you

I wanted you

12:31.240 --> 12:35.240
I've been waiting for you

12:35.240 --> 12:46.800
This is radio station CJ Boogie, with a brand new world premiere song for Captain Jack,

12:46.800 --> 12:47.800

12:47.800 --> 13:00.400
Only you, can make me feel so true, I'll never never be so blue, as long as I have you.

13:00.400 --> 13:10.400
Only you, can't make it feel so true Whatever ever I can't do, it's because of you

13:10.400 --> 13:18.400
Only you, can't make it feel so true Cause I would never be so blue, oh that's right

13:18.400 --> 13:20.400

Hello boys and girls and welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio episode number 131.

14:28.280 --> 14:33.260
In progress, we're here on this Valentine's Day eve.

14:33.260 --> 14:38.680
Happy Valentine's Day to all you lovebirds out there, all you happy, sweet little couples.

14:38.680 --> 14:41.920
And to the rest of you, happy Bitter Singles Awareness Day.

14:41.920 --> 14:47.040
Yes, you're in the same boat that I am, so the next break of songs will be for you.

14:47.040 --> 14:51.040
I'm going to pick some good bitter, bitter angry songs for the next break.

14:51.040 --> 14:55.920
I don't know if there's really a whole lot of breakup songs that are in DDR or Bomani

14:55.920 --> 14:57.600
in general.

14:57.600 --> 15:01.920
The chat room is helping me come up with a few good ideas, but I think it's just going

15:01.920 --> 15:05.680
to be a lot of angry songs next break, a lot of anger, because that's what Valentine's

15:05.680 --> 15:07.440
Day makes me feel, is a lot of anger.

15:07.440 --> 15:11.360
I'm allowed to be bitter once in a while.

15:11.360 --> 15:13.320
Anyway, you are listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

15:13.320 --> 15:16.620
Jamie, aka DarkSakura, is not here tonight.

15:16.620 --> 15:23.920
She is spending Valentine's Day Eve with her man, because she's engaged and has her hetero

15:23.920 --> 15:25.280
life partner or whatever.

15:25.280 --> 15:29.560
I can't remember how she refers to them, but you know they're out and doing their thing

15:29.560 --> 15:36.560
I guess because tomorrow being a workday. It's a little harder to do stuff, so they're doing they're doing their lovey-dovey stuff tonight

15:37.360 --> 15:39.360
so I

15:39.480 --> 15:42.520
Suppose we can forgive it as long as it's only once a year

15:43.040 --> 15:47.020
The minute they try to bring Valentine's Day in like another holiday forget it. It's done with

15:50.760 --> 15:52.760
Wait a minute

15:52.760 --> 16:02.440
I thought Valentine's Day was a pain in the ass for you.

16:02.440 --> 16:07.240
I said I'll allow it, as Judge Mills Lane would say.

16:07.240 --> 16:12.840
Alright, we'll start off the show as we usually do, playing a little bit of How Was Your Week,

16:12.840 --> 16:16.760
How Was Your Day, and I guess we all know that Dark Sakura is the one that usually starts

16:16.760 --> 16:19.960
us off and we all know that she's doing great tonight, I'm sure.

16:19.960 --> 16:23.840
So, uh, you know. Well, I guess we'll go to DDR Angel. DDR Angel, how was your week, how

16:23.840 --> 16:24.840
was your day?

16:24.840 --> 16:32.400
Um, actually it was kind of depressing for once. Me? Depressed? Yeah, right. Okay. First

16:32.400 --> 16:37.640
of all, like, Tuesday when I went to school everything was fine until, like, just before

16:37.640 --> 16:45.000
my second class when I realized my Linux book was missing. And so I was, like, in a slight

16:45.000 --> 16:49.720
panic, emailed the teacher, all that stuff, wondering where the hell it went. And also,

16:49.720 --> 16:55.040
So in the next 48 hours, I was preparing myself to actually have to go out and buy the book

16:55.040 --> 16:56.380
again.

16:56.380 --> 17:02.800
But I went to class Thursday, and it turns out that the student that sits next to me,

17:02.800 --> 17:09.280
I decided to grab it on accident, so she ran up to me on Thursday and gave it back, and

17:09.280 --> 17:17.320
was really apologetic and stuff, so it was just a turnaround from a bad situation to

17:17.320 --> 17:18.320
a good one again.

17:18.320 --> 17:24.560
that turned out really well and the next depressing thing that happened to me is

17:24.560 --> 17:31.880
unfortunately permanent so that kind of sucks the radio station I was DJing for

17:31.880 --> 17:38.280
kthr also known as pulse before it was kthr they ended up shutting down this

17:38.280 --> 17:43.960
week so after three years of my life I'm no longer teaching for a station that I

17:43.960 --> 17:48.200
actually like DJing for so that kind of sucks you know what and and all that

17:48.200 --> 17:51.440
news about what they're doing just you know I think it's time for us to quit

17:51.440 --> 17:56.280
too well it was sad for me because honestly if it wasn't for orange lounge

17:56.280 --> 18:01.400
I wouldn't have you know found them or anything like that so and that was you

18:01.400 --> 18:08.560
know three or what two and a half years ago something like that when I when your

18:08.560 --> 18:14.240
buddy you went to your buddy's show and boom next thing you know I'm DJing for

18:14.240 --> 18:19.340
so yeah oh that's that's right you didn't find out about them until I went

18:19.340 --> 18:24.060
and did the guest thing on their network okay and you know that DJ she's back in

18:24.060 --> 18:29.940
town this weekend so it's kind of neat I know I haven't seen her no she's she's

18:29.940 --> 18:34.260
out she's either working or she's partying there's not a whole lot to do

18:34.260 --> 18:42.320
in town oh yeah so you know I either have a choice of going to a newer radio

18:42.320 --> 18:48.160
station or just kind of hanging low and whatever and you know if it wasn't I

18:48.160 --> 18:52.640
realized that Orange Losers was obviously my first radio station I was associated

18:52.640 --> 18:56.840
with so you guys are always going to be first but as far as you know side work

18:56.840 --> 19:02.280
was concerned the other radio station was just what I did and for half the

19:02.280 --> 19:07.040
week I was just really down and I still am a little bit but I'm getting over it

19:07.040 --> 19:10.800
a little bit you know right slowly well you know and as I said because you

19:10.800 --> 19:15.760
you'd mentioned this in LJ, LiveJournal, for those who don't know, LJ is a place where

19:15.760 --> 19:20.680
we can all get a little emo when we need to be, and you made a little bit of an emo post

19:20.680 --> 19:21.680
earlier this week.

19:21.680 --> 19:22.680
I did.

19:22.680 --> 19:25.560
Because you were sad, you were like, I'm so depressed.

19:25.560 --> 19:27.280
I really was though.

19:27.280 --> 19:31.960
But I mean, as I mentioned in LiveJournal, I'll tell you again, for the benefit of our

19:31.960 --> 19:35.240
listeners, when a radio station like that closes down, you just have to remember the

19:35.240 --> 19:38.920
good memories you have of the people you met there, and you'll know those people for some

19:38.920 --> 19:43.060
time and some of them will go off and do other projects and you know maybe can

19:43.060 --> 19:46.020
help them out with that but you know you'll remember the radio station for a

19:46.020 --> 19:48.880
long time you know it's inevitable orange launch radio will not last

19:48.880 --> 19:56.980
forever you know the three of us have to die someday so I don't plan on dying

19:56.980 --> 20:02.500
ever so I can't help it oh you oh you clicked on oh you know the secret to

20:02.500 --> 20:07.360
immortality then from that banner on the internet the secret of forget it yeah go

20:07.360 --> 20:15.360
So, Fig, the one- yeah, they sent out one spam mail scene who had actually, you know, hit on that, and, um, actually one of them was real.

20:18.360 --> 20:23.360
Oh, I see, okay. And you know what? Not only will I live forever, but my penis is larger than ever.

20:27.360 --> 20:30.360
And you're getting V1 Agra? Really cheap?

20:30.360 --> 20:31.360
Exactly.

20:31.360 --> 20:32.360
V1 Agra?

20:32.360 --> 20:34.360
And my breasts, they're firm and large.

20:34.360 --> 20:42.560
Anyway, it's inevitable that Orange Lounge Radio is going to die someday, so I hope you

20:42.560 --> 20:45.360
all don't get too teary-eyed when it happens.

20:45.360 --> 20:48.040
Someday, but I hope not soon, just because...

20:48.040 --> 20:49.040
It's not going to happen soon.

20:49.040 --> 20:50.720
I don't think so, but...

20:50.720 --> 20:56.800
Unless we get the offer to, you know, take this to like, a real thing, like satellite

20:56.800 --> 21:02.720
radio, or go to some television outlet.

21:02.720 --> 21:10.240
So as I said, I've said this time and time again, I would sell out in 0.5 seconds to

21:10.240 --> 21:12.320
the highest bidder.

21:12.320 --> 21:13.320
My soul is up for...

21:13.320 --> 21:15.320
I'm putting my soul up on eBay.

21:15.320 --> 21:20.320
Anyway, I'd be like, you're going to pay me to do this?

21:20.320 --> 21:21.320
Okay.

21:21.320 --> 21:23.920
You want to pay me for doing Wayne's World?

21:23.920 --> 21:24.920
Sure.

21:24.920 --> 21:28.880
How did I know you were going to go there?

21:28.880 --> 21:30.680
That movie is like my anthem.

21:30.680 --> 21:31.680
It's like...

21:31.680 --> 21:32.680
Anyway, sorry.

21:32.680 --> 21:41.720

been able to play but i think c11 this week just because all the crap that's been going on geez

21:55.480 --> 22:01.480
Um, I guess that's it. I mean, I can't really remember much else.

22:01.480 --> 22:02.480
Great.

22:02.480 --> 22:03.480
Two big things. What?

22:03.480 --> 22:06.480
I just had to point out, they're making bids in the chatroom right now.

22:06.480 --> 22:10.480
Ah, no comment.

22:10.480 --> 22:12.480
I need to learn to keep my mouth shut on this show.

22:12.480 --> 22:15.480
I know it wouldn't make for interesting radio if I didn't say anything,

22:15.480 --> 22:18.480
but every time I open my mouth, I get myself in trouble with the chatroom.

22:18.480 --> 22:21.480
All I got to do is pay more than making out my job, which isn't that much.

22:21.480 --> 22:24.120
Which isn't much! Some of these bids they're makin'!

22:24.120 --> 22:26.640
Some of these bids they're makin'!

22:26.640 --> 22:32.840
So far, all but like one.

22:32.840 --> 22:34.440
Anyway, sorry Angel, we keep cutting you off.

22:34.440 --> 22:37.480
No, it's okay. I would go for the

22:37.480 --> 22:40.840
cute frilly thing that happened this week, but it's not, you know, you guys won't

22:40.840 --> 22:42.200
care, so...

22:42.200 --> 22:43.580
Well, tell it anyway.

22:43.580 --> 22:46.080
At least we can make fun of it.

22:46.080 --> 22:48.120
Yeah, okay, you can make fun of it no problem.

22:48.120 --> 22:52.600
That other game I usually play during the week, uh, There, um...

22:52.600 --> 22:55.760
Now for those who don't know what There is, explain this a little bit. What is There?

22:55.760 --> 23:00.640
It's like Sims, but better. But over there? Yeah, shut up.

23:00.640 --> 23:05.520
Is it, it's kind of like Sims Online? Well, kind of, except you don't have, like, the, um...

23:05.520 --> 23:08.760
There's no prostitutes and gamblers and all that stuff that basically...

23:08.760 --> 23:11.880
Because you heard this is what happened to Sims Online. Sims Online was supposed to be

23:11.880 --> 23:13.040
this, you know,

23:13.040 --> 23:17.520
great new online experience game and it quickly turned into every Vegas street

23:17.520 --> 23:23.760
corner. That's fucking awesome. I would play Sims Online if it didn't cost money, just

23:23.760 --> 23:29.120
for that. Well, there's actually kind of worse, because you end up using your own money to

23:29.120 --> 23:34.480
get, you know, game money and all that stuff, so you kind of have to watch yourself, otherwise

23:34.480 --> 23:39.000
you'll go broke. That's the other interesting thing about there. They have made buying the

23:39.000 --> 23:45.240
in-game currency with real money, like, not a problem. Seriously, because you'll... That's

23:45.240 --> 23:59.240
Whereas every other online role-playing game, you know Final Fantasy, EverQuest, World of Warcraft, you know they frown on people selling the gold or the gil or the whatevers outside of the game for real money.

23:59.240 --> 24:01.240
But there...

24:01.240 --> 24:09.240
I didn't learn Jack's ship from Barman. All I learned is that I might die if I'm not paying attention.

24:09.240 --> 24:16.600
yeah so I mean there's kind of different like that uh I ended up getting their

24:16.600 --> 24:24.120
married quote-unquote oh shut up it was cute whatever so you had an online

24:24.120 --> 24:33.520
wedding yeah only only in America I wanna I wanna their honeymoon yeah what

24:33.520 --> 24:37.680
did you do for the their honeymoon um nothing yet he said he's gonna do it

24:37.680 --> 24:40.280
Yeah, he said I probably would do it tonight or whatever, I don't know.

24:40.280 --> 24:41.780
You're gonna do it tonight, huh?

24:41.780 --> 24:43.780
Shut the hell up!

24:43.780 --> 24:46.780
Hey, it was kinda cool that he shot me off the cliff.

24:46.780 --> 24:49.780
Yeah, shut up. I knew that was gonna go there.

24:49.780 --> 24:52.280
Can you buy some their condoms with real life money?

24:52.280 --> 24:56.280
Ugh! See, now I got them started. What the hell was I thinking?

24:56.280 --> 24:58.280
You better get their morning after pill.

24:58.280 --> 25:01.280
Otherwise you're gonna have their illegitimate child.

25:01.280 --> 25:03.280
Okay, this is just as bad as a piss joke.

25:03.280 --> 25:05.280
Who their baby daddy?

25:05.280 --> 25:10.360
Hey now. Sorry. Anyway, he shot me off a cliff. That was kind of funny.

25:10.360 --> 25:15.680
Wait, what? We jumped into a buggy quote-unquote their car and

25:15.680 --> 25:19.720
he hit the boost and I jumped off, we flew off the cliff. That was kind of funny.

25:19.720 --> 25:24.160
So, you got married and then jumped off a cliff? Yeah. Never mind.

25:24.160 --> 25:27.960
You know, I do watch a story last night about this guy that was trying to get people to

25:27.960 --> 25:34.320
get, you know, to commit suicide on Valentine's Day. See, all it takes is one bitter person and, you know.

25:34.320 --> 25:40.440
they're all dead

25:40.440 --> 25:44.080
wow if only you guys... they're dead

25:44.080 --> 25:47.800
if only you guys knew about that game you probably wouldn't be picking on me so much

25:47.800 --> 25:48.800
but hey it's always fun

25:48.800 --> 25:52.720
I know it sounds like fun it's just I I only have enough time for one game you

25:52.720 --> 25:54.640
know this I can't

25:54.640 --> 25:58.080
I know and I don't know how you do it I can't play more in one game

25:58.080 --> 26:01.700
come Tuesday I'm gonna have to go back to Final Fantasy 11 just because

26:01.700 --> 26:06.060
there is going to be down for like 28 hours or something because they're like relocating

26:06.060 --> 26:07.680
their servers and all that crap so...

26:07.680 --> 26:09.460
They're relocating their servers.

26:09.460 --> 26:10.460
Sorry.

26:10.460 --> 26:16.780
I opened a can of worms!

26:16.780 --> 26:22.220
Oh uh, comment from the chat room, Firebama, I don't know if it's Boma or Bama, I'm gonna

26:22.220 --> 26:24.660
say Bama, I like that it sounds like fire the bomb.

26:24.660 --> 26:29.100
Firebama says their STDs suck, so be careful.

26:29.100 --> 26:30.660
Don't get their herpes.

26:30.660 --> 26:33.660
Yeah. No.

26:33.660 --> 26:37.660
That would suck if you could catch diseases from online games.

26:37.660 --> 26:39.660
Oh jeez.

26:39.660 --> 26:44.660
I think online games are kind of a disease in general. I mean, seriously.

26:44.660 --> 26:50.660
I bet if I went to a shrink and I told them how much I played Final Fantasy XI, she'd fucking slap me upside the head and say,

26:50.660 --> 26:51.660
Go outside!

26:51.660 --> 26:55.660
I'm gonna sue Final Fantasy XI and Square Enix for making me lazy.

26:55.660 --> 26:59.140
but they have their disclaimer at the start of the game that says you know

26:59.140 --> 27:03.980
don't don't forget your family and don't forget your family and friends and work

27:03.980 --> 27:07.100
no I didn't forget my family friends and work but I'm sitting on my ass

27:07.100 --> 27:10.900
playing the game. I acknowledge that they exist however

27:10.900 --> 27:15.420
I think about them all the time

27:15.420 --> 27:18.780
and I think about how much they don't love me

27:18.780 --> 27:21.860
which is why I'm playing this god damn game

27:21.860 --> 27:28.860
If I get killed by a goblin, one more- okay I'll shut up.

27:28.940 --> 27:30.220
Next!

27:30.220 --> 27:31.520
Because I'm done.

27:31.520 --> 27:34.780
Loki, how was your week, how was your day?

27:34.780 --> 27:38.220
Well, um...

27:38.220 --> 27:40.960
I don't even really remember what happened this week.

27:40.960 --> 27:43.340
Not much of anything I'd imagine.

27:43.340 --> 27:46.540
Um...

27:46.540 --> 27:47.700
Well, today

27:47.700 --> 27:52.780
I spent, uh, most of the day playing Final Fantasy, drinking milk, and eating bacon bits.

27:52.780 --> 27:56.460
And, um...

27:56.460 --> 27:58.540
Then what else did I do?

27:58.540 --> 28:02.380
Oh yeah, I started charging my battery, but I found nothing.

28:02.380 --> 28:04.100
Wait, bacon bits? You just...

28:04.100 --> 28:05.660
eat them right out of the...

28:05.660 --> 28:08.100
right out of the can, right?

28:08.100 --> 28:11.740
You just eat the bacon bits right out of the jar? Yep, ate about half the container.

28:11.740 --> 28:15.220
Can I put the jar on the webcam? Well, I don't know if the cam's actually up and

28:15.220 --> 28:17.940
running just yet. I'll check on that first. Well, it's up and running, but it might not

28:17.940 --> 28:20.700
be up and running on the website. I have to make sure everything is running on the web

28:20.700 --> 28:24.060
end. No, it's not. I will set it up, I'll set the webcam up, and I will go show the

28:24.060 --> 28:28.820
jar of bacon bits while you talk about your week here. So anyways, yeah, I was eating

28:28.820 --> 28:33.700
those. I don't know why, because I have, like, this really crappy soup for lunch, and it

28:33.700 --> 28:39.220
just wasn't, you know, hitting the spot. So bacon bits, it was, and I don't know, it worked.

28:39.220 --> 28:45.960
So whatever, so then also what else happened this week, oh my coworker quit finally, and

28:45.960 --> 28:54.400
my other coworker put in his notice, so I'll be all alone, and what else did I do, oh some

28:54.400 --> 29:00.300
other crap I worked on, the thing that pissed me off was my battery that cost me $200 is

29:00.300 --> 29:12.100
fucked up and so now I gotta return it so you know hey the hell oh yeah so then

29:12.100 --> 29:15.660
as I'm playing Final Fantasy and party and eating bacon bits I spill that crap

29:15.660 --> 29:21.700
all over the place so you know probably just some stuck in my for the record

29:21.700 --> 29:30.140
these are imitation bacon buds whatever it's the cheap shit okay don't

29:30.140 --> 29:37.140
be hating. Nellie likes them too. So anyways. And see you ate him! You ate him too!

29:38.300 --> 29:44.340
And I'm grimacing. These are gross. How could you? Ugh! Oh god!

29:44.340 --> 29:47.760
Acquire a taste, Robin. Acquire a taste. And again, I'm also the same person who takes

29:47.760 --> 29:53.740
shots of, you know, Maple Serpent eats rice. Raw. Without being cooked.

29:53.740 --> 29:57.500
Oh, you also eat the top ramen just right out of the bag uncooked too.

29:57.500 --> 29:58.800
That I can do, unfortunately.

29:58.800 --> 30:01.100
Oh, God! Oh, yeah, like, what is wrong with you people?

30:01.100 --> 30:05.100
What? I can do it, but, you know, I haven't...

30:05.100 --> 30:07.500
I haven't eaten it in a...

30:07.500 --> 30:09.700
Okay, that I won't do.

30:09.700 --> 30:12.300
Now my breath's gonna smell like pork.

30:12.300 --> 30:16.800
That bacon bit...flavor's never gonna leave your stomach.

30:16.800 --> 30:18.400
That's one of the things about it.

30:18.400 --> 30:22.200
Can't you just get some lettuce, and some ranch dressing,

30:22.200 --> 30:24.900
and then have yourself a salad, and then put the bacon bits on the salad?

30:24.900 --> 30:28.820
Fucking hate salad dude salad is nasty. I'm sorry, man

30:28.820 --> 30:35.720
I cannot imagine eating like grass or you know shrubbery or something like that. That's just nast bunnies do it. Why can't you?

30:36.700 --> 30:39.380
Yeah, but bunnies poop like crazy. I

30:40.380 --> 30:42.620
Don't fucking take shits like that. I

30:46.260 --> 30:48.260
Give up

30:48.860 --> 30:50.420
Anyways

30:50.420 --> 30:57.100
So yeah, my week was filled with that and then I got to play I'm part of the matrix online stress test one

30:57.180 --> 31:01.180
Which I might say that I'm never gonna buy that fucking game because it's lame

31:02.780 --> 31:09.060
Awful, I mean granted don't you have some type of non-disclosure agreement? Oh, yeah, I will tell you why it sucks

31:09.060 --> 31:12.580
but I'm gonna tell you that sucks, you know, really it I

31:13.540 --> 31:15.380
I like the game

31:15.380 --> 31:19.980
it mean it's pretty in the idea like they have with you know the music where

31:19.980 --> 31:23.180
it's dynamic to what you're doing it changes and that kind of thing that's

31:23.180 --> 31:27.900
cool but I don't know what the fuck I'm doing at all I like got in there I'm

31:27.900 --> 31:35.060
like yeah and you just kind of run around the fighting systems awkward and

31:35.060 --> 31:43.140
just well now wait I I sign no agreement and I happen to see a friend playing

31:43.140 --> 31:48.420
playing this game, so I could express my comments, because I'm not holding no agreement.

31:48.420 --> 31:52.580
I don't care, they can fucking sue my ass, I don't really give a shit.

31:52.580 --> 31:57.700
They ain't gonna get anything, we already talked about how much you make.

31:57.700 --> 32:01.180
You certainly don't get paid for this show.

32:01.180 --> 32:02.180
Exactly.

32:02.180 --> 32:09.700
So, um, yeah, um, yeah, it's not that great.

32:09.700 --> 32:12.260
You know what though, actually in observing it though, I feel a little different.

32:12.260 --> 32:13.900
I actually kind of wanted to play it.

32:13.900 --> 32:16.460
I was kind of like, oh this looks interesting.

32:16.460 --> 32:18.340
Like if I had more of a tutorial.

32:18.340 --> 32:21.020
It looks better than I thought it was going to be.

32:21.020 --> 32:22.020
Yeah.

32:22.020 --> 32:23.020
I'll give you that.

32:23.020 --> 32:27.320
It looks better than I thought it was going to be, and it also, the graphics are pretty

32:27.320 --> 32:28.380
good.

32:28.380 --> 32:33.440
The amount of like, ways you can customize your character is pretty cool.

32:33.440 --> 32:38.180
But like, I did about six or seven of the missions, and I was bored out of my mind.

32:38.180 --> 32:39.380
I'd only gotten to level two.

32:39.380 --> 32:44.300
had no idea how to level up on anything. Did you get to do any bullet time? No. See, that's

32:44.300 --> 32:49.360
what everybody wants. They want bullet time. They want it now. But the thing is, it's like,

32:49.360 --> 32:52.880
I, well, actually, no, I take that back. There was one move that I did, it's called Cheap

32:52.880 --> 32:57.800
Shot. You kinda turn around and in bullet time you kick the guy in the nuts. Cheap Shot

32:57.800 --> 33:02.920
20. So that was kinda cool. Now you got me. But, um, you know, other than that, it's just

33:02.920 --> 33:06.440
like, I didn't really know how to, like, progress in the game, whereas Final Fantasy is pretty

33:06.440 --> 33:12.280
simply you walk outside kill shit. Exactly. You murder bunnies. Like I couldn't tell exactly

33:12.280 --> 33:17.380
I couldn't tell what who was the NPCs who were not the NPCs who were the enemies who

33:17.380 --> 33:22.160
could I fight what the hell the story was it's just it was all confusing there's a tutorial

33:22.160 --> 33:27.180
that I did and I had to quit the game so then I couldn't go back to the tutorial again and

33:27.180 --> 33:31.360
it's just like and then Morpheus drones on for about five minutes once you get the game

33:31.360 --> 33:36.360
for the first time. I was just like, okay, I don't know what the hell's going on. It

33:36.360 --> 33:37.360
was confusing.

33:37.360 --> 33:39.240
So it was kind of like the second Matrix movie?

33:39.240 --> 33:47.280
It's probably better than the second Matrix movie. You know, but I don't know. I'll probably

33:47.280 --> 33:50.680
play it again. I don't really know when the stress test ends. I think it's either this

33:50.680 --> 33:53.080
week or two weeks from now. I'm not sure.

33:53.080 --> 33:56.280
You know, I was actually watching TV last night, and for some reason we have free HBO

33:56.280 --> 33:59.280
right now. I'm not going to complain, but we have free HBO, because I just by chance

33:59.280 --> 34:02.520
was channel starving and I ended up on HBO and they were showing the second

34:02.520 --> 34:06.440
matrix movie and so I started to watch it for like five minutes and I was like

34:06.440 --> 34:15.720
I'm bored I'm going to bed yeah and I love it's just whatever try it if you

34:15.720 --> 34:22.640
want but don't I'd recommend probably Final Fantasy it's just I don't know if

34:22.640 --> 34:26.600
that was my first online game or whatever to get into I'd probably be

34:26.600 --> 34:31.280
confused it it probably turned me off to online games it's it's very good if

34:31.280 --> 34:34.760
you're like a first-person shooter type person and you're getting into online

34:34.760 --> 34:38.760
games that would be the way to go because the controls are that of a

34:38.760 --> 34:42.120
first-person shooter and so you'd probably feel right at home with that

34:42.120 --> 34:47.880
it's like if you're a you know quake doom Halo nut maybe all right sounds

34:47.880 --> 34:54.920
good um I was gonna say forget oh oh yeah I know I was gonna say I still want

34:54.920 --> 35:00.020
give World of Warcraft a fair shot. I got to observe World of Warcraft a little bit

35:00.020 --> 35:08.280
and it seemed interesting, so, but I wasn't like, wowed. Pun intended. You know, I wasn't

35:08.280 --> 35:11.560
like on the floor like, oh my gosh, I have to play this game, like a lot of people who

35:11.560 --> 35:14.300
have been playing it have said. But, Angel?

35:14.300 --> 35:19.480
Um, Magus actually picked it up, so I've been watching him play it.

35:19.480 --> 35:20.480
Does it look good?

35:20.480 --> 35:24.440
yeah it looks it looks good I mean it's it's Blizzard but it was kind of funny

35:24.440 --> 35:28.780
because he was like killing stuff and all of a sudden I hear Diablo 2 sounds

35:28.780 --> 35:34.020
I'm going huh I'm like oh wait Blizzard game so they just recycled the same

35:34.020 --> 35:39.380
effects well you know whatever yeah um the characters characters don't look as

35:39.380 --> 35:44.900
pretty as you know Final Fantasy 11 because it's different so about the only

35:44.900 --> 35:49.180
funny thing that I find actually amusing is like they can do like little dances

35:49.180 --> 35:56.520
and stuff no matter what, you know, depending on what race you choose, that was hilarious.

35:56.520 --> 36:04.360
Like the, what, the dark undead guy can like rock out and stuff, it's really funny.

36:04.360 --> 36:07.100
You know what's interesting is the number one thing I hear about World of Warcraft is

36:07.100 --> 36:12.840
that they say it's more built for the casual player who wants to play by themself and doesn't

36:12.840 --> 36:18.660
really want to party up a whole lot, and my first reaction is, well then why play a multiplayer

36:18.660 --> 36:24.220
a massive online game if you want to play by yourself! That's the part I don't get,

36:24.220 --> 36:29.020
but other than that... Because, here's why, because in like, when you get down to Final

36:29.020 --> 36:33.020
Fantasy or whatever, in the higher levels, if you don't find a party, you're stuck. You're

36:33.020 --> 36:39.580
just sitting there for hours doing nothing, and that's why. People will get turned off

36:39.580 --> 36:43.620
by that kind of crap. Because they don't, you know, obviously know they could be doing

36:43.620 --> 36:47.340
thousands of other things. You can find things to do, even when you're high level. But people

36:47.340 --> 36:50.620
want to be leveling up and they can't do that

36:50.620 --> 36:54.900
but you cuz you could do you know in fires let me you could do something you

36:54.900 --> 36:55.300
could do

36:55.300 --> 36:58.540
are you know but you know people don't want stuff that's very misleading in

36:58.540 --> 37:00.580
Final Fantasy 11 for example you know

37:00.580 --> 37:03.920
easy prey stuff when you're level right 10

37:03.920 --> 37:07.900
is fucking easy when you get up to like level 30 whatever

37:07.900 --> 37:12.300
you can't kill an easy prey thing by yourself it's just that kind of

37:12.300 --> 37:16.100
I'm difficulty stuff they need to kinda fix that a bit

37:16.100 --> 37:20.500
because I want to be fighting something that's easy to pray and have it be easy to kill.

37:20.500 --> 37:25.100
Whereas I don't get shit for experience, but I want it to be fucking easy to kill.

37:25.100 --> 37:35.100
Alright. Let's move on, and Explicit joined us. He snuck in through the door while we were talking there a little bit ago.

37:35.100 --> 37:36.100
So how you doing, Explicit?

37:36.100 --> 37:40.100
Pretty okay for the whole week.

37:40.100 --> 37:42.100
Well, I was going to ask, how was your week, how was your day, sir?

37:42.100 --> 37:51.660
Well, this whole week's been hell, this whole, been pretty much hell, due to all of unnecessary

37:51.660 --> 37:58.380
drama that's been shoved in my face the whole week, especially like right after the tournament

37:58.380 --> 37:59.600
of course.

37:59.600 --> 38:01.300
How did things go with the tournament, by the way?

38:01.300 --> 38:05.740
Okay, like during the tournament it went very well, because like, I mean, we had the speakers

38:05.740 --> 38:11.220
and had the microphone to talk to people and what they think about the tournament so far,

38:11.220 --> 38:15.180
know it seems pretty fair I mean a lot of people had fun and stuff but I heard

38:15.180 --> 38:21.320
a lot of the bad news of course we all know drama drama drama revolution where

38:21.320 --> 38:25.640
would we be without it yeah unfortunately we get a bit we get

38:25.640 --> 38:30.880
somebody who was bitching about bitching the whole time I'm like and trying to

38:30.880 --> 38:35.400
get into the faces of the judge to the people calculating the scores okay let

38:35.400 --> 38:39.880
us do first of all let us do our jobs don't come around bitching and bitching

38:39.880 --> 38:44.480
I don't understand you drove like three hours away from home, but if you're not gonna let us do our jobs

38:44.480 --> 38:47.680
How the hell are we gonna get the whole tournament finished in the time?

38:48.920 --> 38:50.920
unfortunately the tournament

38:51.680 --> 38:55.760
The PA tournament ended at 645 instead of six o'clock as expected

38:57.160 --> 38:59.700
Hmm, yeah, of course you get people fishing about

39:00.360 --> 39:03.480
certain people some people fishing about the pad issues, which is

39:03.960 --> 39:07.880
Which started to be common in every tournament since b3 maybe?

39:07.880 --> 39:12.980
be where someone like bitch back oh the I got a great we should do a do because

39:12.980 --> 39:19.900
the arrows not working no the players not working it happened in Sundayville

39:19.900 --> 39:24.560
golf plan three numerous times were everyone had to play one pad because the

39:24.560 --> 39:27.820
left side is not working I heard you took my suggestion though I heard that

39:27.820 --> 39:33.380
you actually made them all sign a form that says the rules are final and pad

39:33.380 --> 39:37.740
disputes will be didn't I had heard that you made everybody sign a form yes I did

39:37.740 --> 39:42.980
good good for you unfortunately some people like went out to the bear like

39:42.980 --> 39:47.820
some people went out of the barrier look what happens they got kicked out the one

39:47.820 --> 39:52.780
person got kicked out see this is what happens if you start drama you this is

39:52.780 --> 39:55.780
before the tournament you should have asked me questions personally and during

39:55.780 --> 39:59.980
the forms I'll see what I can do with the solution so it doesn't become a rush

39:59.980 --> 40:06.100
hour I think there should be a settlement process if there is reasonable

40:06.100 --> 40:10.260
doubt that the machine's malfunctioning, but you know, what that exactly is, does it take

40:10.260 --> 40:14.760
two people bitching, does it take whatever, you know, and then what's the process to review

40:14.760 --> 40:17.940
the machine, you know, you gotta set that all up in advance, I think once a reasonable

40:17.940 --> 40:22.180
process is established, there's really no way you can complain about it.

40:22.180 --> 40:26.020
But here's the thing though, it's a little debatable because sometimes the techs are

40:26.020 --> 40:32.780
not there to help, to help buy the parts, you know, like buy, let's see, you know like

40:32.780 --> 40:37.080
each arrow has four sensors itself right and buying 32 parts in case one of them

40:37.080 --> 40:41.160
goes dead is not really a reasonable solution because you're spending a lot

40:41.160 --> 40:45.520
of money itself because you know you're not owed the whole like vendors money

40:45.520 --> 40:49.100
because they're spending parts on this so you're basically gonna be left in a

40:49.100 --> 40:54.160
deficit like right after the whole tournament is over the sad thing is is

40:54.160 --> 41:00.280
you could bring a brand new pad in there brand spanking new pad and somehow it's

41:00.280 --> 41:04.000
possible it could get fucked up during the tournament and it would not work so

41:04.000 --> 41:08.000
you just have to I don't know you just sometimes have to just bite the bullet

41:08.000 --> 41:11.280
and accept that things aren't always gonna work perfectly at the tournament

41:11.280 --> 41:15.080
yeah I mean I understand that but I mean this is why it's like in my opinion I'm

41:15.080 --> 41:17.800
not trying to say like it's like unacceptable at some people might say

41:17.800 --> 41:23.000
some people also have to check to check on player styles like freeze sort of

41:23.000 --> 41:25.640
like freeze down the way you have to figure out ways to make sure you get the

41:25.640 --> 41:30.360
perfect rather than just try to cheat your way I mean here's I mean here's a

41:30.360 --> 41:32.720
here's an honorable here's a here's a question what would you rather have

41:32.720 --> 41:36.560
someone who would accept defeat or someone who likes to bitch too much so

41:36.560 --> 41:39.720
they can get a do-over in favor they're part of the tournament so they can move

41:39.720 --> 41:44.080
up someone who takes the defeat and takes the criticism on how to get better

41:44.080 --> 41:49.220
of course yeah unfortunately it comes to a point where oh my god like here's a

41:49.220 --> 41:54.120
here's an example like one of the rounds I think somebody got the person like

41:54.120 --> 42:00.120
I'm not gonna say any names. The person got like 13 greats and then he claims

42:00.120 --> 42:05.460
that he got three greats on that song. Unfortunately he said, oh my god I got

42:05.460 --> 42:09.600
10 greats on the same arrow. We checked his playstyle, he's been getting the

42:09.600 --> 42:17.400
greats on the wrong arrow. Interesting. Yeah and then of course you got the

42:17.400 --> 42:21.320
rules. Like I said before they should have asked beforehand so he can come up

42:21.320 --> 42:27.980
solutions. I mean, Tody did it, or should I say Andrew, he was worried about

42:27.980 --> 42:33.860
putting suggestions about dark mode. I added another option, which is one speed.

42:33.860 --> 42:37.860
Right. Like one of the two ways. Right. I'm not gonna make it, the tournament's more

42:37.860 --> 42:41.380
like an advanced format, it's not really like the same traditional format like

42:41.380 --> 42:45.860
everyone thinks it is. I'm thinking about using a traditional so people do,

42:45.860 --> 42:49.140
They'll cause less bitching for tournaments.

42:49.140 --> 42:51.500
Or cancel singles PA overall.

42:51.500 --> 42:53.800
Well, you know, you gotta just...

42:53.800 --> 42:56.940
It's one of those things where I think it gets to a point where if the rules are gonna

42:56.940 --> 43:00.300
be outside the box a little bit, then if you're a competitor, you gotta review the rules.

43:00.300 --> 43:01.660
And if it's not for you, don't enter.

43:01.660 --> 43:04.180
Wait for the next tournament.

43:04.180 --> 43:07.260
I'm not trying to blame...

43:07.260 --> 43:08.260
When we did...

43:08.260 --> 43:11.980
We did a tournament a while back and the qualifier...

43:11.980 --> 43:13.700
I don't remember which tournament this was.

43:13.700 --> 43:18.020
I want to say it was Shaft a while back a couple years ago. This was the one at Scandi

43:18.020 --> 43:21.540
It was the first one we did it was it was the same one. We had the 2d x-tournament at

43:23.140 --> 43:28.620
And the qualifier because it wasn't March Madness the qualifier had to be on dark reverse and

43:29.820 --> 43:33.900
We've the complaints were kind of minimal on it because we outlined physically no complaint

43:33.900 --> 43:39.020
we we outlined the rules in advance and said here are the songs and you'll have to do it dark reverse and

43:39.020 --> 43:41.940
And if you don't like it, don't enter.

43:41.940 --> 43:45.820
The thing is, I released the songs during the tournament.

43:45.820 --> 43:49.860
I said in the rules completely that the songs are going to be

43:49.860 --> 43:51.580
released during the tournament.

43:51.580 --> 43:55.060
There are 16 songs to choose from, from easy to hard.

43:55.060 --> 43:58.220
We did this really weird setup, and I wish I could find those

43:58.220 --> 44:00.620
rules again, because I think they're actually pretty good.

44:00.620 --> 44:03.460
But it was like, you could choose a song from list A, B,

44:03.460 --> 44:06.620
or C, and B would keep your score even.

44:06.620 --> 44:08.820
A would reduce your score automatically by a little bit,

44:08.820 --> 44:12.820
because they were easier songs and C would increase the score by a little bit because they were like 9-footers and hard songs.

44:12.820 --> 44:14.820
Yeah, I know that system. You guys did a tier system.

44:14.820 --> 44:15.820
Yeah.

44:15.820 --> 44:23.820
I mean, that was a system that worked very well. I was thinking about using it for Sacktown Smackdown or what people call piss.

44:23.820 --> 44:28.820
Unfortunately, considering that the community is starting to be a bitch hole.

44:28.820 --> 44:36.820
I'm not trying to say any names here, but it comes to a point where people are ruining the fun for everybody else.

44:36.820 --> 44:41.340
this is where I pissing all over it this is of course you seem like you see

44:41.340 --> 44:45.380
TOS like quitting tournaments because of it because they can't handle the

44:45.380 --> 44:50.940
situation and this is where I came in and take some take some numerous action

44:50.940 --> 44:56.980
eliminating though eliminating the pests all right well anything else in your

44:56.980 --> 45:01.860
week outside the tournament how else was your week and stuff okay I'll spend some

45:01.860 --> 45:05.220
more of the tournament later like probably at FU's um okay well it's been

45:05.220 --> 45:09.940
hell lately and oh yeah of course you got everyone knows about Ash Wednesday

45:09.940 --> 45:14.020
where they had to sacrifice something for 40 days and 40 nights oh yeah Lent

45:14.020 --> 45:19.340
okay any I got a question did anybody sacrifice anything for Lent? I sacrificed

45:19.340 --> 45:31.260
going to church. Wow. Now I and I'll do respect it's not my cup of tea for that

45:31.260 --> 45:38.180
stuff so no I didn't sell I don't celebrate one what'd you give up it's

45:38.180 --> 45:43.600
pretty it's pretty a shame you to say in Orange House radio I'll say it right now

45:43.600 --> 45:48.560
what I sacrificed getting a boner for Lent getting you wait wait you

45:48.560 --> 45:52.120
sacrificed getting a boner you are you're not allowed to get a boner for

45:52.120 --> 45:59.440
the next 40 days yes I sacrificed masturbating with my left hand it's

45:59.440 --> 46:03.620
Strictly right hand from now on wait. Wait, what are you gonna do?

46:03.620 --> 46:08.540
What are you gonna do it that hot asian girl with big boobs walks by you just gonna look the other way real quick before

46:08.860 --> 46:12.420
dirty thoughts that way that drinking a lot of water to gulp down and

46:15.900 --> 46:20.260
It's a tough decision it's like basically a lint that no man has gone before

46:21.500 --> 46:23.500
You got to tape it down

46:23.620 --> 46:29.100
That's what you're gonna have to do is you're going to have to tuck your penis back and make yourself have a vagina

46:29.100 --> 46:31.900
That's the only way you're gonna stop getting a boner all together.

46:31.900 --> 46:33.900
Oh boy, he really wants one of those!

46:33.900 --> 46:36.900
Even that is not, you know, foolproof either, I mean...

46:36.900 --> 46:39.900
That is like...

46:39.900 --> 46:44.900
I'd like to compare it to, like, the octopus, you know, where you have multiple brains, you know, octopuses...

46:44.900 --> 46:47.900
Octopi have multiple brains.

46:47.900 --> 46:52.900
They have brains to control their feet, or their tentacles, or whatever, and, you know, their normal brain.

46:52.900 --> 46:55.900
I'm sorry, but what's that signal? What do you see?

46:55.900 --> 47:00.420
What's hot girl signal has gone down to the air brain? It's all over what what are you gonna?

47:00.420 --> 47:03.700
Do if you wake up in the morning, and then you're like oh fuck

47:04.500 --> 47:09.620
God hates me. What are you gonna? Do so wait? Here's the thing so far. I've actually survived

47:09.820 --> 47:14.540
I'm not gonna need a boner. I've seen this attractive way, but no boner and

47:15.260 --> 47:18.700
I woke up no boner. I took a piss no boner

47:21.940 --> 47:23.940
Does like a semi-count

47:23.940 --> 47:27.940
And here's the thing, no I'm not taking any anti-viagra.

47:29.940 --> 47:31.940
Wow. Wow.

47:31.940 --> 47:37.940
So yes, it's a challenge, but I'm living up to my word. No boner for the next 40 days.

47:37.940 --> 47:40.940
I hate to say it, but keep us posted.

47:40.940 --> 47:42.940
It's on my LJ.

47:42.940 --> 47:43.940
Alright.

47:43.940 --> 47:45.940
For those who want to check out the-

47:45.940 --> 47:54.940
You know if he comes back here on day 39, I'm going to have like the rotating, you know, big-titted Asian prawn hentai, everything going on the screen in here.

47:54.940 --> 47:58.940
I should have like a sign that says, you know, gone this many days without wood.

48:01.940 --> 48:04.940
Wow. Amazing.

48:04.940 --> 48:08.940
That's amazing.

48:08.940 --> 48:14.940
Alright, my way...

48:14.940 --> 48:20.940
I could take that down the gutter even further, but for the sake of humanity I'm not going to.

48:20.940 --> 48:22.940
Good luck my friend, good luck, that's all I have to say.

48:22.940 --> 48:24.940
Oh come on man, we need time to kill.

48:24.940 --> 48:31.940
Nah, it's alright, it's alright. Trust me, you don't want me to go there.

48:31.940 --> 48:34.500
I'm sorry, I'm having a comedy show on my mind.

48:34.500 --> 48:36.420
And this is why we'll never make it...

48:36.420 --> 48:37.420
Seriously.

48:37.420 --> 48:44.660
The folks from Satellite Radio are listening right now, oh, we've just found out about

48:44.660 --> 48:49.180
this program that's all about gaming and these people here are all into gaming and they've

48:49.180 --> 48:51.420
done it for years, they gotta be good at this.

48:51.420 --> 48:52.420
Now they're tuning in.

48:52.420 --> 48:56.820
You're gonna get a boner in 40 days, you can't go 40 days without a boner.

48:56.820 --> 48:58.900
We're gonna put big-titted women on the screen.

48:58.900 --> 49:03.260
To tell you how much G4 has sold out to just, you know, selling everything with sex on their

49:03.260 --> 49:06.460
damn station, because that's, I guess, the only way they think it's going to work, they're

49:06.460 --> 49:13.380
going to have some football game coverage featuring the Lingerie Bowl girls.

49:13.380 --> 49:16.060
Oh yeah, that's game related.

49:16.060 --> 49:18.340
Oh yeah.

49:18.340 --> 49:20.700
Is that the Tech TV part of the station?

49:20.700 --> 49:21.700
I...

49:21.700 --> 49:22.700
Anyway.

49:22.700 --> 49:25.140
No, no, see, you forget.

49:25.140 --> 49:27.140
Tech TV's no longer part of the station.

49:27.140 --> 49:28.140
Oh, my bad.

49:28.140 --> 49:53.140
Anyway, my week and my day, since we didn't get around to it yet, my week and my day were pretty good. I went out to the clubs last night, you know, shaking my thing, and it's so hilarious when you hear DDR songs at the club. I know I'm such a loser for thinking that, but you know, we were dancing in the room where all the videos come on, and they played shiny disco balls, you know, from Ultramix.

49:53.140 --> 49:58.740
And I just to illusion in the chat room we call those weekdays

50:01.420 --> 50:03.420
What comment were you responding to

50:07.580 --> 50:10.460
Love the state said on the mic low key. We need to hear that

50:10.460 --> 50:16.960
I was responding to the comment Loki should have a spin-off show where he feels on big-breasted

50:17.180 --> 50:21.580
Asian girls and shouts racial slurs for two straight hours. I call those weekdays

50:21.580 --> 50:25.580
Alright, alright. I'm sorry explicit, you were saying?

50:25.580 --> 50:29.580
Speaking of that, guess what I heard in 24 Hour Fitness when I was working out?

50:29.580 --> 50:33.580
Someone asked to play- Butterfly! No.

50:33.580 --> 50:37.580
Era from TAC. What? I'm serious. I was working out

50:37.580 --> 50:41.580
with the wades, and I heard Era. I'm like

50:41.580 --> 50:45.580
what the fuck? On like the 24- what do they

50:45.580 --> 50:49.580
have in there? Like a 24 hour fitness radio station or music? No, they play it regular

50:49.580 --> 50:59.580
Any song that people put in their music box, they played some of the stuff from GDR Max, like Sandstorm.

50:59.580 --> 51:05.580
I know that Jamie had burned a CD for her spin group, they do the bike spin thing.

51:05.580 --> 51:09.580
But I don't know how many Bimani songs she put on. I think it was mostly like top 40 junk.

51:09.580 --> 51:13.580
And this was funny to burn one of these CDs for Jamie to have to make her, you know.

51:13.580 --> 51:15.580
But they had to get something that was friendly to everybody.

51:15.580 --> 51:20.860
She's like, and of course she comes to me, Rob, do you have Toxic by Britney?

51:20.860 --> 51:23.580
Oh wait, oh wait a minute, wait a minute.

51:23.580 --> 51:24.580
What, what?

51:24.580 --> 51:30.940
I see a comment about, laugh out loud, it's even more crazy to see someone doing DDR steps

51:30.940 --> 51:31.940
in clubs.

51:31.940 --> 51:32.940
Dude, I was just getting to that.

51:32.940 --> 51:37.420
When Shiny Disco Balls came on, I was kind of like dancing, like, Disco, Disco, Disco,

51:37.420 --> 51:39.420
like doing the little steps in UltraBates.

51:39.420 --> 51:42.500
Speaking of that, speaking of that, okay, this is, speaking of, speaking relating to

51:42.500 --> 51:47.060
the tournament I know it's over but I found out the reason why someone wanted to win first place

51:47.060 --> 51:53.220
was to take this girl to this junior prom and to realize I would I would imagine if he

51:54.100 --> 52:00.020
does DDR in the freaking prom wait wait wait wait wait some guy wanted to win the tournament

52:00.020 --> 52:05.060
because if he won the tournament like money stuff okay I thought I thought the girl wouldn't date

52:05.060 --> 52:10.900
him unless he won the tournament type I know the girl too okay that's a really bad setup for like

52:10.900 --> 52:16.600
DDR freak the movie you know like never mind yeah yeah you know this is

52:16.600 --> 52:23.580
ridiculous it's very sad but true you basically have to rip off the whole

52:23.580 --> 52:28.780
storyline for 10k commotion I'm not having another DDR freak movie

52:28.780 --> 52:37.540
discussion I'm not having it again on the show the only way no other way none

52:37.540 --> 52:45.200
this robot chick Asian person dancer no never can I talk about my week I guess

52:45.200 --> 52:49.280
all right so Friday night Friday night I was hanging out with some friends and we

52:49.280 --> 52:53.360
went over to rice princesses house you know the one from outside the box

52:53.360 --> 52:55.920
although we haven't really done outside the box in several weeks which I

52:55.920 --> 52:59.760
apologize guys for but you know there's just been other circumstances coming up

52:59.760 --> 53:05.680
and the show may be moved or retooled in the near future so I appreciate those

53:05.680 --> 53:09.100
you guys who are bearing with us, but we just have a lot of other crap that's been getting

53:09.100 --> 53:15.400
in the way, so something might change with that. Anyway, um, but as far as Friday nights

53:15.400 --> 53:19.940
go, I saw, for the very first time in my life, and I know this is hard to believe, I had

53:19.940 --> 53:26.340
never seen The Fifth Element before, the movie. I finally saw it Friday night. It was very,

53:26.340 --> 53:34.140
um, gay, really. Like the costumes and everything, and, no, I don't know how to describe it.

53:34.140 --> 53:37.660
it was alright I guess. Although the thing I thought was kind of cool about the fifth

53:37.660 --> 53:43.560
element was that it was kind of like a video game plot. It really was. It was a total video

53:43.560 --> 53:50.720
game plot. Anyway. So I guess that was pretty much it. I mean my weekend was the only exciting

53:50.720 --> 53:55.320
part of my week I guess. I didn't have a whole lot else going on. I was kind of lazy. Oh

53:55.320 --> 54:01.400
well. Alright. Any other comments before we go to break? Chirp, chirp, chirp, chirp. Explicit?

54:01.400 --> 54:06.740

I know I'm so wrong

01:00:14.780 --> 01:00:25.780
Why, why, why should I?

Hi ho, Kermit the Frog here informing you that today's broadcast of Orange Lounge Radio

01:01:36.260 --> 01:01:45.880
is brought to you by the letter B, the letter A, and the number 59.

01:01:45.880 --> 01:01:50.880
We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 131.

01:01:50.880 --> 01:01:56.040
A happy early Valentine's Day to all of you people out there, or Singles Awareness Day,

01:01:56.040 --> 01:01:58.360
whatever the case may be for you.

01:01:58.360 --> 01:02:00.800
As promised, we're going to talk about some Bimani news right now.

01:02:00.800 --> 01:02:06.360
Big news, Dancing Stage Unleashed 2, at least if you're in Europe, this will be big news

01:02:06.360 --> 01:02:11.120
to you, for everybody else, not so big a news, but at least there's a new DDR game on the

01:02:11.120 --> 01:02:12.120
way.

01:02:12.120 --> 01:02:14.120
What do you know?

01:02:14.120 --> 01:02:17.780
tracks have already been announced for this game pretty cool basement jacks

01:02:17.780 --> 01:02:24.820
where's your head at girls allowed love machine happy Mondays step on super

01:02:24.820 --> 01:02:33.320
grass all right Donna summer hot stuff the jam a town called malice all of them

01:02:33.320 --> 01:02:37.160
supposedly supposed to have the background videos to them as well very

01:02:37.160 --> 01:02:40.760
interesting also you know what else basically by the way for those who don't

01:02:40.760 --> 01:02:47.520
Dancing Stage Unleashed, it's basically gonna be their version of Ultramix 2, so

01:02:47.520 --> 01:02:50.960
they're getting that. What's very interesting about this, though, the rumor

01:02:50.960 --> 01:02:55.720
is is that you're gonna be able to play this on Xbox Live. You'll be able to play

01:02:55.720 --> 01:03:02.640
against people in the US if you're in Canada, but only on those songs that the

01:03:02.640 --> 01:03:07.320
two games share. So that should be interesting, though, is that now you can

01:03:07.320 --> 01:03:10.240
settle the score with any of your buddies that live in Europe. You can

01:03:10.240 --> 01:03:16.320
actually play on Xbox Live against them? Loki, your thoughts on Unleashed 2?

01:03:16.320 --> 01:03:22.080
Really just nothing new as far as, you know, gameplay features other than, you know, the

01:03:22.080 --> 01:03:28.440
online thing. I'm interested to see, though, because you know how Ultramix 2, they had

01:03:28.440 --> 01:03:34.000
their deal with a different drum, what they're going to do as far as, you know, the extra

01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:38.120
music for this, you know, game. I wonder if they're going to team up with, like, maybe

01:03:38.120 --> 01:03:43.880
a UK label or something like that. That would be what I'm waiting for to see what's going

01:03:43.880 --> 01:03:48.520
to happen there.

01:03:48.520 --> 01:03:55.260
Any thoughts on Unleashed 2 from Angel or Explicit?

01:03:55.260 --> 01:03:59.780
Sounds pretty cool. I mean, there's a couple songs that they always get that we don't that

01:03:59.780 --> 01:04:04.800
I wish that we had, but you know, I can keep wishing, whatever.

01:04:04.800 --> 01:04:08.560
I know, it seems like Europe always gets these awesome licenses, don't they?

01:04:08.560 --> 01:04:11.440
Basie and Jax is awesome, and they're getting... oh man.

01:04:11.440 --> 01:04:16.160
See? Now you're bummed too. I know, a little bit. I want them all. I want all those here, but I'm

01:04:16.160 --> 01:04:19.880
tempted to get a Europe PS2 at this point, although this is going to be for Xbox.

01:04:19.880 --> 01:04:22.900
I still want a Europe PS2 just to get, like, all the games,

01:04:22.900 --> 01:04:26.360
but of course then I'd have to get the converter, so the TV would show it.

01:04:26.360 --> 01:04:29.100
It's just not worth it that much. I don't know.

01:04:29.100 --> 01:04:34.780
explicit your thoughts well i'm thinking it's it's just the same songs and same in different

01:04:34.780 --> 01:04:39.180
steps like the new songs and new steps that's basically i'm hearing so far i mean we got xbox

01:04:39.180 --> 01:04:45.180
flight like stated earlier i don't know it looks like it's like every time they release like the

01:04:45.180 --> 01:04:49.660
dancing stage is like the same old stuff i mean there's a i don't know it might have been i think

01:04:49.660 --> 01:04:53.820
there should be like more new stuff maybe but i'm not gonna judge it from a cover until it's

01:04:53.820 --> 01:04:58.620
released good thought i never want i'll never judge a game until the game is released and i

01:04:58.620 --> 01:05:01.420
actually play it. I would be interested to know if they're gonna get the song

01:05:01.420 --> 01:05:06.500
packs as well. Because that would be a whole lot of songs that you could play

01:05:06.500 --> 01:05:12.060
you know against because how many songs is it gonna share with Ultramix 2? I

01:05:12.060 --> 01:05:15.580
don't know probably I mean I guess you can probably bet that most of the

01:05:15.580 --> 01:05:19.220
Konami originals are going to carry over things like I don't know Zero One, Route

01:05:19.220 --> 01:05:26.540
80, but I don't know will they all who knows we don't know yet so we shall see.

01:05:26.540 --> 01:05:31.100
but then we always have step mania if it's but then we always have step mania

01:05:31.100 --> 01:05:37.420
in case yeah you don't get the songs yeah like ultramix 3 or extreme 2 or even

01:05:37.420 --> 01:05:41.060
with DDR with Mario you know I'm just looking forward to getting to kick some

01:05:41.060 --> 01:05:46.340
British ass on Xbox live actually no I'm kidding I'm gonna get hate mail from

01:05:46.340 --> 01:05:50.900
that one actually I can't wait to start hearing some of those sexy sexy accents

01:05:50.900 --> 01:05:57.760
through the speaker name some you know the hello I hope you having a good day

01:05:57.760 --> 01:06:06.440
would you like to do some TD on then have some tea I'm getting so much hate

01:06:06.440 --> 01:06:08.960
mail from anybody that's listening to this in Europe right now I'm just I'm

01:06:08.960 --> 01:06:12.560
just joking okay I'm in California haha we all have blonde hair and blue eyes

01:06:12.560 --> 01:06:13.560
and go surfing, huh?

01:06:13.560 --> 01:06:14.560
What?

01:06:14.560 --> 01:06:18.560
They speak to you in the spagnole of Francais.

01:06:18.560 --> 01:06:22.560
Oh, that could be interesting because you might be playing people in other countries.

01:06:22.560 --> 01:06:23.560
Is that possible?

01:06:23.560 --> 01:06:27.560
Do they sell the stuff outside of Britain?

01:06:27.560 --> 01:06:29.560
Do they sell it in like France, Spain?

01:06:29.560 --> 01:06:30.560
I don't even know.

01:06:30.560 --> 01:06:31.560
I don't know either.

01:06:31.560 --> 01:06:32.560
I imagine it wouldn't be that hard yet.

01:06:32.560 --> 01:06:35.560
Everything is done by the whole European system.

01:06:35.560 --> 01:06:40.560
It's not just the British anymore.

01:06:40.560 --> 01:06:45.560
Let's get the Japanese on there, too. Let's settle this once and for all. Seriously.

01:06:45.560 --> 01:06:47.560
Blank. Blank.

01:06:47.560 --> 01:06:54.560
Come on. Who cares if we can't speak the same language? We can speak the universal language of kickin' ass.

01:06:54.560 --> 01:06:58.560
Or, or, or, or, or, or, or, or whatever some French is.

01:06:58.560 --> 01:06:59.560
Oh, get it up.

01:06:59.560 --> 01:07:03.560
Did I tell you about the last time I, uh, beaten an Asian on DDR?

01:07:03.560 --> 01:07:04.560
Wait, what?

01:07:04.560 --> 01:07:06.560
Even though that was a long-ass time ago.

01:07:06.560 --> 01:07:08.560
What was this, Angel? What?

01:07:08.560 --> 01:07:13.060
Oh, I actually, uh, beat an Asian playing, uh, DDR6 mix.

01:07:13.060 --> 01:07:15.060
How old was she, six?

01:07:15.060 --> 01:07:18.060
I'm just kidding! I'm just kidding!

01:07:19.060 --> 01:07:21.060
He was, like, nineteen or something.

01:07:21.060 --> 01:07:22.060
That's cool.

01:07:22.060 --> 01:07:24.060
And he couldn't- he didn't believe that, like,

01:07:24.060 --> 01:07:29.060
there was actually American people playing DDR and all that stuff, and...

01:07:29.060 --> 01:07:31.060
It was kind of funny.

01:07:31.060 --> 01:07:33.060
Hm. That's cool.

01:07:33.060 --> 01:07:34.060
Anyways.

01:07:34.060 --> 01:07:37.060
It was in the middle of Japan, and we know this.

01:07:37.060 --> 01:07:39.060
This is like two years ago.

01:07:39.060 --> 01:07:42.060
And it's so funny because you know some folks make the assumption that instantly,

01:07:42.060 --> 01:07:45.060
Oh, we're all gonna get killed by the Japanese on DDR if this happens.

01:07:45.060 --> 01:07:50.060
But you know what? Just like their shitty American players, they're shitty Japanese players.

01:07:50.060 --> 01:07:54.060
Everybody's new to DDR at some point, so you know, you gotta start somewhere.

01:07:54.060 --> 01:08:00.060
Until you watch some Japanese girl walk up to the TDX machine and just completely own everyone else.

01:08:00.060 --> 01:08:02.060
That was insane. Okay.

01:08:02.060 --> 01:08:07.060
Anyways, you've got people saying, yo quiero, DDR!

01:08:07.060 --> 01:08:09.060
Oh my god.

01:08:09.060 --> 01:08:12.060
Just stop. Seriously, stop.

01:08:12.060 --> 01:08:13.060
Okay, okay.

01:08:13.060 --> 01:08:14.060
Alright.

01:08:14.060 --> 01:08:16.060
I'll stop with the...

01:08:16.060 --> 01:08:19.060
More news going on. Actually, I don't know if you guys noticed, but

01:08:19.060 --> 01:08:23.060
DDR Freak had a whole lot of news this week. I'm sure a lot of you guys are watching DDR Freak.

01:08:23.060 --> 01:08:28.060
And we, of course, have to show a little love to DDR Freak because they replay us on their Friday nights on DDR Freak Radio.

01:08:28.060 --> 01:08:34.220
Freak Radio. Kisses. So they have a lot of stuff. And really what I've noticed this week

01:08:34.220 --> 01:08:39.540
is a whole lot of looking for people. They're looking for people. There's all sorts of stuff.

01:08:39.540 --> 01:08:44.600
It's like casting calls left and right. They're looking for people. It's interesting. Speaking

01:08:44.600 --> 01:08:51.500
of Yo Quiero DDR, a Spanish language network was looking for a Spanish speaking DDR player.

01:08:51.500 --> 01:08:54.700
We don't know what's going on. I don't know what ended up happening with that. I didn't

01:08:54.700 --> 01:09:00.040
reading the comments, but they were looking for somebody. First For Women magazine was

01:09:00.040 --> 01:09:05.280
looking for a mother who lost weight playing DDR with their kid, which I think, you know

01:09:05.280 --> 01:09:09.340
what, I think that's kind of neat. That's kind of cool. I know my mom wouldn't even

01:09:09.340 --> 01:09:12.360
know how to turn on a PlayStation, let alone get up and play DDR.

01:09:12.360 --> 01:09:15.480
I know some mothers who have like five-year-old children.

01:09:15.480 --> 01:09:21.640
Cool mommies, not mine. And this is a call that everybody could participate on. This

01:09:21.640 --> 01:09:23.680
This is what I thought was really cool.

01:09:23.680 --> 01:09:26.640
DDR Freak was helping out the Make-A-Wish Foundation of Indiana.

01:09:26.640 --> 01:09:29.760
They were helping this child's dream come true.

01:09:29.760 --> 01:09:34.800
This child, Robbie, has a kidney disease, and his wish was for a game room in his home

01:09:34.800 --> 01:09:36.260
featuring DDR.

01:09:36.260 --> 01:09:42.160
So they just rallied the troops together to buy him just like the supremo setup for DDR.

01:09:42.160 --> 01:09:43.260
So that's kind of cool.

01:09:43.260 --> 01:09:44.620
If you're interested in that, check it out.

01:09:44.620 --> 01:09:49.640
It's the February 10th headline over on DDRFreak.com, certainly worth participating in.

01:09:49.640 --> 01:09:54.860
And Red Octane, this was just announced recently, Red Octane is going to be doing a focus group

01:09:54.860 --> 01:09:59.140
in Sunnyvale this Friday and next Friday.

01:09:59.140 --> 01:10:02.920
And I guess if you participate, which by the way is at 7 o'clock, you have to have your

01:10:02.920 --> 01:10:06.120
own transportation to Sunnyvale, so if you're on the East Coast, sorry, you're screwed,

01:10:06.120 --> 01:10:10.860
but if you're somewhere in the Bay Area, Red Octane will provide dinner, I wonder what

01:10:10.860 --> 01:10:14.980
kind of dinner?

01:10:14.980 --> 01:10:18.220
Maybe I should write and inquire, are we going to get Black Angus, or are you going to get

01:10:18.220 --> 01:10:19.220
like, you know, McD's?

01:10:19.220 --> 01:10:20.220
Interesting.

01:10:20.220 --> 01:10:26.500
Maybe I can talk to Red Octane, but unfortunately I can't make it those Friday, Thursday, Friday,

01:10:26.500 --> 01:10:27.500
or Saturday.

01:10:27.500 --> 01:10:31.420
It's Friday, February 18th and Friday, February 25th at 7 o'clock.

01:10:31.420 --> 01:10:33.940
Maybe the 25th I could maybe make it.

01:10:33.940 --> 01:10:35.840
I know that this week I cannot.

01:10:35.840 --> 01:10:39.500
You know what, what's funny is I'm actually tempted to sign up for it.

01:10:39.500 --> 01:10:43.500
I'm so damn curious.

01:10:43.500 --> 01:10:44.500
I'm very tempted.

01:10:44.500 --> 01:10:45.500
That's all I have to say.

01:10:45.500 --> 01:10:47.500
You know, it's also pretty interesting as well.

01:10:47.500 --> 01:10:51.500
A tournament is also the day after, too.

01:10:51.500 --> 01:10:53.500
Another tournament in Milpitas.

01:10:53.500 --> 01:10:55.500
Another one? What are they doing this time?

01:10:55.500 --> 01:10:57.500
It's also what Red Octane is involved in as well.

01:10:57.500 --> 01:10:59.500
It's called Got Skill.

01:11:01.500 --> 01:11:03.500
I wish I could go, but I can't.

01:11:03.500 --> 01:11:11.500
Plus, people say it's a bad idea to even go anyways because, you know, some people will still get heated up with drama from the last tournament.

01:11:11.500 --> 01:11:15.500
It's just stupid. People should grow... I mean, I don't want that...

01:11:15.500 --> 01:11:18.500
Which is the reason why I won't be going as well.

01:11:18.500 --> 01:11:21.500
So I'll let people take care of their business there.

01:11:21.500 --> 01:11:25.500
You're a bitter, bitter man after some of these tournaments, aren't you?

01:11:25.500 --> 01:11:30.500
No, because I'm only bitter to those who cannot accept defeat or think they're like 100% correct.

01:11:30.500 --> 01:11:34.500
When they're obviously not, they can't admit their own mistakes.

01:11:34.500 --> 01:11:38.500
Instead of trying to get better, they just whine.

01:11:38.500 --> 01:11:40.500
So, I'm just going to leave it as is.

01:11:40.500 --> 01:11:45.500
is. Some of the competitors I know are going to go there, like, some of the Sacktown people

01:11:45.500 --> 01:11:51.780
of Team Piss or... There's actually a Team Piss now? No, just Team Piss. Oh, okay. Some

01:11:51.780 --> 01:11:55.780
people call it the Paradise Island Sacktown Squad, but you just call it Team P.I. Not

01:11:55.780 --> 01:12:04.240
Team Piss. Interesting. No more piss jokes now. I'm trying. Alright, if you guys are

01:12:04.240 --> 01:12:10.360
interested in the Red Octane focus group, you can check that out on www.ddrfreak.com.

01:12:10.360 --> 01:12:14.320
I'm sure there will be non-disclosure agreements involved, so even if we do get to check it

01:12:14.320 --> 01:12:18.720
out, if I do decide I want to put in and I get picked, I probably won't be able to talk

01:12:18.720 --> 01:12:25.080
about it, but, you know, it'll be still kind of neat to see. So, we'll see. We will see.

01:12:25.080 --> 01:12:29.680
Moving on. This is big news. This is huge. This is huge news.

01:12:29.680 --> 01:12:30.680
How huge?

01:12:30.680 --> 01:12:31.840
Huge. Bigger than big.

01:12:31.840 --> 01:12:39.000
You know that other dancing game? Not in the groove, but the other one, the Korean one.

01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:40.000
Pump It Up.

01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:41.320
Oh, what about it?

01:12:41.320 --> 01:12:46.080
Pump It Up Exceed is going to be released in North America on the PlayStation 2.

01:12:46.080 --> 01:12:47.080
Yes, I heard about it.

01:12:47.080 --> 01:12:48.080
Very interesting, huh?

01:12:48.080 --> 01:12:52.880
How are you supposed to release Exceed 2, not just Exceed?

01:12:52.880 --> 01:12:58.720
Well, here it is. This is the press release straight from InsertCredit.com. Mastiff has

01:12:58.720 --> 01:13:04.280
announced that it will be publishing Andamiro's Pump It Up Exceed for Playstation 2 and Xbox

01:13:04.280 --> 01:13:10.840
in North America in June. They made the announcement at the Metreon and we had an ace Pump It Up

01:13:10.840 --> 01:13:14.520
player named Smidget there and they were strutting their stuff on an arcade and a home version

01:13:14.520 --> 01:13:19.100
of the Dance Mat game. The Pump It Up franchise, according to this press release, has sold

01:13:19.100 --> 01:13:25.540
over a quarter million copies of the arcade versions and PC versions thus far. Now you'll

01:13:25.540 --> 01:13:27.780
You'll notice they don't say what country.

01:13:27.780 --> 01:13:31.500
I already know what countries have been selling Pump It Up pretty well.

01:13:31.500 --> 01:13:36.140
I imagine the PC version isn't doing too badly, but probably not so much in this country.

01:13:36.140 --> 01:13:39.420
Although, you know, Red Octane has it in their store, and I imagine a lot of people pick

01:13:39.420 --> 01:13:40.420
it up through there.

01:13:40.420 --> 01:13:41.420
Here's the thing, though.

01:13:41.420 --> 01:13:45.420
Let's see, Pump It Up's more international than DDR, because I know Pump It Up's mainly

01:13:45.420 --> 01:13:53.140
supported in Mexico and mainly South America as well, because America mainly DDR overpopulated

01:13:53.140 --> 01:13:54.880
the whole franchise.

01:13:54.880 --> 01:13:56.440
You got your pump fans, though.

01:13:56.440 --> 01:13:59.560
I mean, like, overall, compared to, like, other countries.

01:13:59.560 --> 01:14:05.320
I know Mexico popularizes Pump It Up, Argentina, Chile, or anywhere in South America.

01:14:05.320 --> 01:14:08.520
Yeah, I've heard the same thing, a lot of South American countries really big on Pump

01:14:08.520 --> 01:14:13.000
It Up, as well as a lot of the countries in the East that aren't Japan or China, a lot

01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:14.600
of those, like, other countries.

01:14:14.600 --> 01:14:15.600
Korean, Korea.

01:14:15.600 --> 01:14:16.600
Yeah, definitely.

01:14:16.600 --> 01:14:21.100
I'm not sure what other places support Pump It Up, as well.

01:14:21.100 --> 01:14:25.660
It should be noted this is not going to be the exact same as the Korean PS2 version that

01:14:25.660 --> 01:14:30.040
was just launched because there's going to be some exclusive songs, including a song

01:14:30.040 --> 01:14:34.480
by Stereogram called Walkie Talkie Man, and it's going to have the actual video that runs

01:14:34.480 --> 01:14:35.480
in the background.

01:14:35.480 --> 01:14:37.920
For those of you guys who haven't seen it, it's like a claymation video.

01:14:37.920 --> 01:14:39.080
It's kind of a rock song.

01:14:39.080 --> 01:14:40.960
It's not your typical dance song.

01:14:40.960 --> 01:14:43.140
It's kind of more of a rockish song.

01:14:43.140 --> 01:14:49.040
But then again, a lot of the Korean songs in Pump It Up were kind of rock songs, so

01:14:49.040 --> 01:14:51.400
It kind of makes sense why they're doing this.

01:14:51.400 --> 01:14:52.920
So what do you guys think?

01:14:52.920 --> 01:14:54.240
Good idea, bad idea?

01:14:54.240 --> 01:14:55.400
I mean, it's a great idea, but I just

01:14:55.400 --> 01:14:58.240
want to know how the axis system is going to work.

01:14:58.240 --> 01:15:01.760
You know how Pump It Up has the middle and the diagonals.

01:15:01.760 --> 01:15:04.440
I'm not sure how the pads are going to work on this.

01:15:04.440 --> 01:15:07.280
That's my first initial thought, is that Pump It Up immediately

01:15:07.280 --> 01:15:11.000
has a kind of, they're screwed out the gate.

01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:13.740
Because all these third party pads and stuff,

01:15:13.740 --> 01:15:16.860
unless they do some kind of axis tilting, which even then

01:15:16.860 --> 01:15:19.860
wouldn't really work because you wouldn't have a middle button I don't

01:15:19.860 --> 01:15:22.940
know how they do it if you could do autoplay on the middle which wouldn't

01:15:22.940 --> 01:15:27.260
really be the game then there's really no way to get these third-party pads to

01:15:27.260 --> 01:15:32.780
work unless the third-party pad has all the buttons I don't know is a nine

01:15:32.780 --> 01:15:36.000
square pad or something the lack of a center button is really gonna screw

01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:43.460
things up Loki there are the what pads are those there the I want to say cold

01:15:43.460 --> 01:15:50.220
But, Cobalt Flux pads do have the center button, so those will be able to be used, but those

01:15:50.220 --> 01:15:52.420
are like high-end ones.

01:15:52.420 --> 01:15:57.780
As nice of a pad as Cobalt Flux is, how popular is it really?

01:15:57.780 --> 01:16:01.060
It's not the kind of thing you walk into GameStop and purchase, right?

01:16:01.060 --> 01:16:05.940
I had a hard enough time finding an Ignition 2.0 locally, and even when I bought an Ignition

01:16:05.940 --> 01:16:10.940
2.0, I spent $100 on an Aspad, they were like, we've never sold one of these before, you're

01:16:10.940 --> 01:16:12.900
You're actually going to buy this?

01:16:12.900 --> 01:16:15.540
The fuck is wrong with you?

01:16:15.540 --> 01:16:18.180
And I was just kind of like, it's a good pad.

01:16:18.180 --> 01:16:21.380
I don't want to spend 20 bucks on the cheap pad that's going to break next week.

01:16:21.380 --> 01:16:26.380
But again, it all goes back to the fact that, you know, these Pump It Up pads aren't as

01:16:26.380 --> 01:16:28.580
easily buyable in the store.

01:16:28.580 --> 01:16:32.140
How likable is it that these places are going to want to buy these pads and stock them in

01:16:32.140 --> 01:16:33.140
the store?

01:16:33.140 --> 01:16:36.180
I think it brings a lot of confusion to the market in a way.

01:16:36.180 --> 01:16:37.180
Very confusing.

01:16:37.180 --> 01:16:40.060
I mean, first of all, Pump It Up is a very hard game to learn.

01:16:40.060 --> 01:16:45.300
You know, cause you know how, you know how like many, same idea, you see this thing,

01:16:45.300 --> 01:16:50.500
you step on it, granted it might be a little bit, I mean the problem is like so many like,

01:16:50.500 --> 01:16:55.420
like this is coming from the Pump It Up player itself, um, I play Pump It Up, and I've seen

01:16:55.420 --> 01:17:00.180
like numerous like people who are just looking over DDR than Pump It Up, so you know, they

01:17:00.180 --> 01:17:04.260
think Pump It Up is like a rip off of DDR because it has the same arrows, and it's hard

01:17:04.260 --> 01:17:08.900
to play cause it's diagonals, you know, they just want to say something simple like up,

01:17:08.900 --> 01:17:13.000
down left right it's really not the same dance style though it's really not it's

01:17:13.000 --> 01:17:16.480
really isn't I think pump it up is easier to freestyle to I think a lot of

01:17:16.480 --> 01:17:21.000
the songs you automatically like your body's an emotion where you're giving a

01:17:21.000 --> 01:17:24.040
lot of room on freestyle itself and pump it up and like I said it's a real

01:17:24.040 --> 01:17:29.040
different type of music too it's my problem with it and this is the big one

01:17:29.040 --> 01:17:34.200
how the fuck are you gonna be able to play those extreme and crazy songs that

01:17:34.200 --> 01:17:38.200
That is true. There's one song that's impossible to even beat.

01:17:38.200 --> 01:17:46.200
There's where they have the four or five, you know, button mashing. I mean, it's just not fun.

01:17:46.200 --> 01:17:56.200
That's my main complaint about Pump It Up to the Game is those crazy songs where you have to do, like, knee drops and shit. No thanks.

01:17:56.200 --> 01:18:00.200
Well, that was my issue with In the Groove, but we're not talking about that game right now.

01:18:00.200 --> 01:18:01.200
In the Groove is a different game than the...

01:18:01.200 --> 01:18:03.200
Yeah, I know. Anyway...

01:18:03.200 --> 01:18:10.780
Well, I've said this at least like every week for the past few weeks, my beef with In The

01:18:10.780 --> 01:18:18.000
Groove is that, and specifically In The Groove's fan base, sorry guys, but this is my beef,

01:18:18.000 --> 01:18:25.520
is that In The Groove is not DDR, unless it's convenient for it to be DDR, because whenever

01:18:25.520 --> 01:18:29.100
people bitch about, you know, a lack of DDR, then they go, oh well there's always In The

01:18:29.100 --> 01:18:34.700
groove I thought you just said in the groove wasn't DDR that's my number one

01:18:34.700 --> 01:18:38.460
complaint here I mean some people confused they're basically two different

01:18:38.460 --> 01:18:43.460
games you have different timing different music different options it's

01:18:43.460 --> 01:18:47.780
all different some people say they're trying to compare like oh in the group

01:18:47.780 --> 01:18:55.480
is DDR night mix and no no I wouldn't go that far I I but I think for the most

01:18:55.480 --> 01:18:59.080
part in the groove you know I've said this before in the groove kind of

01:18:59.080 --> 01:19:10.080
It is DDR. It's just, but it's evolved. It's evolved DDR. They're beating Konami to the punch. That's what they're doing. I mean, whatever.

01:19:10.080 --> 01:19:16.080
But anyways, back to what I was talking about.

01:19:16.080 --> 01:19:17.080
Pump.

01:19:17.080 --> 01:19:27.080
Pump it up, yeah. I just want to see how the game turns out and how many songs it can fit. They said the PS2 hardware could actually handle it, and Xbox hardware still could handle it.

01:19:27.080 --> 01:19:28.080
Oh yeah.

01:19:28.080 --> 01:19:48.080
I don't see this game doing well because of the fact that I think, and this is kind of ironic, I think a lot of places are going to view it, and remember folks, you and I, you being the Bamani addict because you're actually taking time to tune in and listen to this show, you and I understand the differences between DDR and Pump It Up.

01:19:48.080 --> 01:19:56.080
But, the casual gamer, somebody who walks into a game, a parent who walks into a game and stops buying the stuff for their kid, are they going to really understand the difference?

01:19:56.080 --> 01:20:01.080
No. And the people who are supplying this, I think a lot of people are going to view it as a cheap knockoff of DDR.

01:20:01.080 --> 01:20:03.080
Yeah, obviously.

01:20:03.080 --> 01:20:09.080
I think that's the way the casual gamer is going to look at it. Now, but here's the thing, if the price is right, that could help it.

01:20:09.080 --> 01:20:13.080
You know, somebody wants to get into the dance thing and...

01:20:13.080 --> 01:20:19.580
According to how they view, that's just like, just because Pump It has a stepping arrow does not mean it's a rip-off of the year.

01:20:19.580 --> 01:20:28.280
Look at other games, like, that's just like saying, ooh, there's a lot of Mario knock-offs, or there's a lot of Doom knock-offs, and et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.

01:20:28.280 --> 01:20:30.280
I can keep going on and on and on about...

01:20:30.280 --> 01:20:35.080
Here's the thing, again, again, you're talking about the casual gamer versus the addict, the dance game addict.

01:20:35.080 --> 01:20:38.580
The casual gamer, what you can see that a game is not Mario.

01:20:38.580 --> 01:20:43.300
You can see that this game is not Mario, but you see that this is another dance game with

01:20:43.300 --> 01:20:45.980
arrows that scroll up to the top of the screen, that you hit them.

01:20:45.980 --> 01:20:47.940
You and I understand the difference.

01:20:47.940 --> 01:20:48.940
Most people don't.

01:20:48.940 --> 01:20:56.740
Sadly, that's true, unfortunately, because so many people are so narrow-minded to judge

01:20:56.740 --> 01:21:00.520
from their first impressions without getting a chance to look deeply what the game is all

01:21:00.520 --> 01:21:01.520
about.

01:21:01.520 --> 01:21:06.300
It's like, ooh, they say, ooh, Resident Evil, or anything they see is popular, they're going

01:21:06.300 --> 01:21:14.220
to buy it, regardless if the game is either good or bad, you just look from their eyes,

01:21:14.220 --> 01:21:20.820
which kind of makes me wonder if people are paying attention to what they purchase and

01:21:20.820 --> 01:21:21.820
stuff.

01:21:21.820 --> 01:21:25.660
I think the price has a lot to do with it.

01:21:25.660 --> 01:21:30.660
I'd be very curious to know how that little Mad Catz game is selling right now, that shitty

01:21:30.660 --> 01:21:34.700
little Mad Catz GameCube game, the dance game, I'd be very curious to know how that's doing

01:21:34.700 --> 01:21:35.700
right now.

01:21:35.700 --> 01:21:39.700
I don't think it's doing too hot, but I'd be very curious to know.

01:21:39.700 --> 01:21:43.700
From my source, I think it's not doing good at all,

01:21:43.700 --> 01:21:47.700
considering that some people actually played it.

01:21:47.700 --> 01:21:51.700
But again, the people that you're talking to are DDR

01:21:51.700 --> 01:21:55.700
and Bamani addicts. I'm not talking about DDR, I'm talking about casual gamers.

01:21:55.700 --> 01:21:59.700
Not just DDR addicts and stuff. Not the people we know in the community,

01:21:59.700 --> 01:22:03.700
just regular casual gamers itself.

01:22:03.700 --> 01:22:20.700
I'd just be curious to know. I mean, but that's the thing. This is my other concern. What if that game, heaven forbid, is somebody's first exposure to a dance game? Then they'd never want to play DDR. They'd be all, oh, I played one of those dancing games once. It was stupid.

01:22:20.700 --> 01:22:28.700
Yeah, like I said, something that comes first will always get the fish and people are just going to buy that.

01:22:28.700 --> 01:22:33.180
that I think that's where and when a lot of folks say I'm kind of going on a

01:22:33.180 --> 01:22:36.460
little tangent here but I don't care what a lot of folks say and then back to

01:22:36.460 --> 01:22:41.620
the in the groove not being DDR again we're the addicts that have played the

01:22:41.620 --> 01:22:45.660
dance games for years and years we understand that difference but to say

01:22:45.660 --> 01:22:49.140
that you know well you have all these fighting games and people understand

01:22:49.140 --> 01:22:54.100
that the fighting games are different they all look different these dance

01:22:54.100 --> 01:22:58.820
games kind of look the same sure they have their subtle differences but they

01:22:58.820 --> 01:23:03.520
kind of look the same so to most people they don't see those differences a dance

01:23:03.520 --> 01:23:13.020
game is a dance game so something to think about like if Sonic Sonic came out

01:23:13.020 --> 01:23:16.880
first and you know people gonna jump on that bag of bandwagon because I think

01:23:16.880 --> 01:23:21.820
it's the first I came out then anything else trying to be like it is just a

01:23:21.820 --> 01:23:28.340
a knockoff and nothing to sell. Just like how Madden, I'm just trying to post examples

01:23:28.340 --> 01:23:38.920
here, come on now. That's how I view sports games. Madden, Blitz, they're all football

01:23:38.920 --> 01:23:44.900
games to me. They're interchangeable parts to me. A football game is a football game.

01:23:44.900 --> 01:23:50.980
But now if I were the sports guy, I would be saying, oh, Sky, you're an ignorant motherfucker.

01:23:50.980 --> 01:23:56.140
games are all different like this game's got this license and this game you play

01:23:56.140 --> 01:24:00.460
and then you can play in the street and these different but to me the football

01:24:00.460 --> 01:24:06.860
games they're all the same I played one I played them all maybe I'm just being a

01:24:06.860 --> 01:24:10.580
little too critical with when I think about certain games especially when I

01:24:10.580 --> 01:24:15.340
played practically almost every game there is

01:24:15.340 --> 01:24:18.340
Go to a friend of mine who keeps running games and I play them.

01:24:45.340 --> 01:25:15.260
Oh, do it all night. Do it with me. I'll take you to heaven if you make me feel free.

01:25:15.260 --> 01:25:22.260
Do it tonight, do it alright Just take me and shake me till I burn up inside, aww

01:25:36.260 --> 01:25:40.260
You may have got sex with Sam and Fred and Drizzle Max

01:25:40.260 --> 01:25:43.260
You may be the slave of Tim and Tom and Ed some days

01:25:43.260 --> 01:25:46.760
You may do it again with handsome friends and checking care

01:25:46.760 --> 01:25:50.760
But you're gonna feel so free when you do it with me

01:25:50.760 --> 01:25:53.760
Do it all night, do it with me

01:25:53.760 --> 01:25:56.760
I'll take you to heaven if you make me feel free

01:25:56.760 --> 01:26:00.760
Baby, do it tonight, do it alright

01:26:00.760 --> 01:26:03.760
Just take me and shake me till I burn up inside

01:26:03.760 --> 01:26:07.760
Oh, do it all night, do it with me

01:26:07.760 --> 01:26:10.760
Hard as a fire and as strong as a tree

01:26:10.760 --> 01:26:14.260
Do it tonight, do it alright

01:26:14.260 --> 01:26:17.760
You got it, I knew it, you can do it tonight

01:26:25.760 --> 01:26:28.760
You're the home of the fire, of the straw in the tree

01:26:28.760 --> 01:26:35.760
Come on, do it with me.

01:27:28.760 --> 01:27:30.760
I'm gonna trust me

01:27:30.760 --> 01:27:35.760
I see them, I see them

01:27:35.760 --> 01:27:38.760
Yuma, Yuma, don't get me

01:27:38.760 --> 01:27:41.760

More or less, I'll be there

Yuma, Yuma, don't touch me for me

01:27:50.760 --> 01:27:53.760
Ooh-ah, ooh-ah, don't touch me

01:28:23.760 --> 01:28:51.760
This morning, I open my eyes And everything's still the same

01:28:51.760 --> 01:29:00.760
I turned to the guy who was dated last night And now I can watch your lips

01:29:00.760 --> 01:29:07.760
I think it needs to happen more and more I love those men one and all

01:29:07.760 --> 01:29:15.760
Each new one of me makes my heart beat fast When I see them so strong and tall

01:29:45.760 --> 01:29:47.760
I'll get it too

01:30:15.760 --> 01:30:15.860

They serve a bit of it, my name is, they serve a bit of it, my name is...

01:31:49.760 --> 01:31:52.600
You know they played that song at the club last night too, the...

01:31:52.600 --> 01:31:59.080
a beat better work it I love that song love it anyway um in that break you

01:31:59.080 --> 01:32:02.980
heard some songs there some a different type of Valentine's Day for you do it

01:32:02.980 --> 01:32:09.940
all night injection of love so many men and Jack and Mark get busy get it Jack

01:32:09.940 --> 01:32:16.100
and Mark yeah even though the song really has nothing anyway I just think

01:32:16.100 --> 01:32:19.820
it's got a funny title I was I couldn't think of a fourth song that was kind of

01:32:19.820 --> 01:32:24.060
that without doing like a four-song erotic break trying to mix up the

01:32:24.060 --> 01:32:27.660
artists a little bit I couldn't think of a four song I'm sure now they'll be

01:32:27.660 --> 01:32:32.980
yelling it's yelling ideas in the chat room so yeah we'll see anyway we are

01:32:32.980 --> 01:32:35.460
gonna open up the skype line in a little bit if you're trying to call in right

01:32:35.460 --> 01:32:39.380

01:32:39.380 --> 01:32:43.860
chance to fire up the skype line and call in www.orangeontrader.com click on

01:32:43.860 --> 01:32:46.940
interact with us if you want more information before we do that though I

01:32:46.940 --> 01:32:51.860
want to talk about Loki's little project. Loki's been working on this project for

01:32:51.860 --> 01:32:57.580
several weeks now and this is exciting to me because he has actually finished

01:32:57.580 --> 01:33:02.100
this project and I've known Loki a while now and he never finishes his projects.

01:33:02.100 --> 01:33:06.460
This is like the first project I've seen him actually finish. So Loki set it up

01:33:06.460 --> 01:33:12.860
for us. What is this you're doing and why, Angel if you'd be so kind, what is this

01:33:12.860 --> 01:33:19.040
you're doing and why I basically made a portable computer that's inside of an

01:33:19.040 --> 01:33:25.040
xbox why I don't know I could have simply bought a laptop for the amount of

01:33:25.040 --> 01:33:28.460
money they spent building this damn thing by the way it's screen caps on

01:33:28.460 --> 01:33:31.380
orange andre dot-com right now if you want to save them that would be lovely

01:33:31.380 --> 01:33:38.860
I'm sure we'd appreciate that yeah cuz I need you know anyways there it is it's

01:33:38.860 --> 01:33:46.460
on the webcam, the orange box. There really looks like, you know, an Xbox. It's all orange.

01:33:46.460 --> 01:33:51.920
How did you build this? What parts went into this? Well, there's a micro-ITX board that's

01:33:51.920 --> 01:33:58.780
inside. It's a very small 15 centimeter by 15 centimeter motherboard. There's a 160 hard

01:33:58.780 --> 01:34:03.960
drive which is going to have wonderful rips of movies and whatnot to take with me because

01:34:03.960 --> 01:34:09.880
it's also going to be used as a media-type computer when I'm done. I'd be hooking up

01:34:09.880 --> 01:34:16.760
to a TV, you know, to play movies off of and whatnot. It's got Windows XP on it right now.

01:34:16.760 --> 01:34:22.280
I have built a portable monitor to go with it, which is on the webcam right now. It's

01:34:22.280 --> 01:34:28.200
actually inside of a metal CD case, and it runs off of batteries if it needs to be, which

01:34:28.200 --> 01:34:33.480
in this case it is running off of battery power right now. Normally, the PC itself actually

01:34:33.480 --> 01:34:38.080
does have a battery however as I'm charging up today it looks like that the

01:34:38.080 --> 01:34:42.800
battery is defective or something and only charged about 75% of the way before

01:34:42.800 --> 01:34:47.840
it said it was full and it's not so I have to send that back so that kind of

01:34:47.840 --> 01:34:53.640
sucks but um everything um it looks really sweet I wish I could open the

01:34:53.640 --> 01:34:59.480
case up for you guys to see it's got a UV fan on the top of it a kind of a like

01:34:59.480 --> 01:35:04.760
a blower. And so, basically the whole thing is just, you know, self-contained in this

01:35:04.760 --> 01:35:12.280
Xbox case right now. It's pretty sweet. It's kind of slow, because micro-ITX PCs are only,

01:35:12.280 --> 01:35:17.480
they're, they have the processor built into the actual motherboard, and it's only one

01:35:17.480 --> 01:35:23.200
gigahertz. So, we're talking a little slow, but, you know, hey, for a portable PC, it's

01:35:23.200 --> 01:35:28.240
not bad. I think it's interesting that the monitor is just one of those PS1 screens.

01:35:28.240 --> 01:35:33.640
It's crazy. How can you see things on that?

01:35:33.640 --> 01:35:34.640
Very carefully.

01:35:34.640 --> 01:35:40.680
It's a five, literally, it's a five inch monitor. And as if those like fifteen inch screens

01:35:40.680 --> 01:35:43.880
weren't bad enough, you are doing computing work on a five inch monitor.

01:35:43.880 --> 01:35:51.400
Well, I have a shortcut on the desktop for the magnifier in case, you know, I can't read

01:35:51.400 --> 01:35:57.120
something. Because, you know, it does get tough. Especially when I set up the graphics

01:35:57.120 --> 01:36:02.560
and stuff. I have the resolution set really low, so I can actually, you know, be able

01:36:02.560 --> 01:36:04.560
to, you know, do stuff with it.

01:36:04.560 --> 01:36:10.080
Yeah, it's a lovely shot of our floor there on the webcam right now, and the massive DVD

01:36:10.080 --> 01:36:14.360
collection there.

01:36:14.360 --> 01:36:16.320
And so, yeah, the lowest I could go...

01:36:16.320 --> 01:36:17.960
I'm sorry, so was it, what do you want?

01:36:17.960 --> 01:36:21.000
Was the resolution by 320 by 240?

01:36:21.000 --> 01:36:22.280
I don't think you can go that low, can you?

01:36:22.280 --> 01:36:27.280
It is a pro-PS screen, I'm not sure if it can go by...

01:36:27.280 --> 01:36:37.280
No, it's really actually, to be honest, because I have it 640x480 and I adjusted all the fonts so they're huge, I can actually read it pretty well.

01:36:37.280 --> 01:36:43.100
icon you know the icons you can read what they you know say on it and

01:36:43.100 --> 01:36:49.140
everything and it's not that hard to read and like I said I have the

01:36:49.140 --> 01:36:54.680
magnifier you know macro or not really macro but a shortcut to the magnifier

01:36:54.680 --> 01:36:58.520
and if I can't read anything you just move it over there and you can actually

01:36:58.520 --> 01:37:02.240
read it there's a little like window at the top that magnifies everything really

01:37:02.240 --> 01:37:06.980
big so you can actually see it but this monitor I mean not only will it output

01:37:06.980 --> 01:37:12.220
it'll output to anything that takes the TV out, you know, or TV in. So I can hook this

01:37:12.220 --> 01:37:16.900
up to the TV and that's, you know, we won't have any problems seeing the picture. This

01:37:16.900 --> 01:37:24.380
is just for, you know, to make it sure portable, which I hope to take it with me, the E3. That

01:37:24.380 --> 01:37:29.040
was the whole purpose of building it in the first place. Now, if I can only get that goddamn

01:37:29.040 --> 01:37:34.600
battery to work. Yeah. I just think it's so crazy you took an Xbox. Why did you decide

01:37:34.600 --> 01:37:36.500
to put a computer inside an Xbox.

01:37:36.500 --> 01:37:44.500
Because honestly, I thought about first doing a Dreamcast, too small, and the Xbox being

01:37:44.500 --> 01:37:47.700
the largest console system that I can think of.

01:37:47.700 --> 01:37:51.900
Well you know what's funny is that, I don't know, have you shown like an above shot of

01:37:51.900 --> 01:37:53.900
it where they can see the fan?

01:37:53.900 --> 01:37:57.900
Because it's so funny because you actually drilled out that little Xbox logo that's in

01:37:57.900 --> 01:38:02.060
the center of an Xbox, and that's where you put the fan, and I find that so hilarious,

01:38:02.060 --> 01:38:04.440
I don't know why I'm so easily amused by that.

01:38:04.440 --> 01:38:08.120
but the way you laid everything out is so funny. Plus, I think it's funny, you were

01:38:08.120 --> 01:38:13.120
telling me about how you were holding some of the stuff in. You were, literally parts

01:38:13.120 --> 01:38:17.880
of this computer are being held together, oh that's a nice shot right there on the webcam.

01:38:17.880 --> 01:38:20.880
Literally parts of this are being held together by duct tape and zip ties.

01:38:20.880 --> 01:38:27.240
No, not duct tape. Zip ties for the most part. The hard drive is being held in by zip ties

01:38:27.240 --> 01:38:31.560
because the way it had to be mounted, I couldn't mount it on the bottom because I didn't have

01:38:31.560 --> 01:38:36.600
the right screws for it. So I actually mounted it with zip ties, and that sucker ain't movin'.

01:38:36.600 --> 01:38:43.220
So, um, that's pretty good. Um, the CD-ROM is actually being held in there, not by duct

01:38:43.220 --> 01:38:49.360
tape, but it's just double-stick tape that, you know, has a five-pound, um, weight limit

01:38:49.360 --> 01:38:54.280
on it, so the CD-ROM's fine. And it's this little laptop, I actually have a laptop CD

01:38:54.280 --> 01:38:59.620
burner in here. Wow. See, for... You actually have a drive, I didn't realize you had a drive

01:38:59.620 --> 01:39:06.620
in there. Why the hell did you fit that? There's a CD burner in there that actually fits in

01:39:06.620 --> 01:39:12.520
there right where the normal drive would be. That is crazy! The only problem is, lately

01:39:12.520 --> 01:39:17.380
it's been sticking, so I gotta figure out why that is, but that barely fit in there.

01:39:17.380 --> 01:39:22.220
With the fan in there, it's literally pressed up right against the fan. Now, Dark Knight

01:39:22.220 --> 01:39:26.980
says, if Bill Gates were to see that, Loki would be so toast right now. It's running

01:39:26.980 --> 01:39:32.740
Microsoft Windows. It's not like I put Linux in it.

01:39:32.740 --> 01:39:36.400
Yeah, can you install Linux on it? Because God knows they'll install Linux on anything

01:39:36.400 --> 01:39:43.600
they can. I think it's quite a little complicated. But you didn't go out and buy an Xbox and

01:39:43.600 --> 01:39:47.640
gut it. No, I bought a case online. On eBay.

01:39:47.640 --> 01:39:53.160
Not on eBay. There's an actual website that sells case mods and stuff so you can buy clear

01:39:53.160 --> 01:39:55.900
clear cases. I should have bought a clear case, that would have been cool, but they

01:39:55.900 --> 01:40:03.240
were like $30 more, so I was like, ask for it. So, I bought a case, and the hard drive,

01:40:03.240 --> 01:40:10.240
everything's mounted on my own. I had to make and drill mounts for the motherboard. I had

01:40:10.240 --> 01:40:16.600
to dremel the hell out of this. I want to move it so I can show the other side here,

01:40:16.600 --> 01:40:21.320
But I'm afraid that I'm going to knock the power thing out again.

01:40:21.320 --> 01:40:27.760
But anyways, yeah, unlike most PCs where you have all your ports on the back of the PC,

01:40:27.760 --> 01:40:33.080
this has all the ports on the side of the Xbox, so it'd be on the left-hand side, and

01:40:33.080 --> 01:40:38.920
I unfortunately cannot reach the camera over there to see that, but trust me, they're there.

01:40:38.920 --> 01:40:40.600
And then the power's in the back.

01:40:40.600 --> 01:40:44.620
The power right now was being held on by hot glue, however that fell off, so it's being

01:40:44.620 --> 01:40:52.220
held on by a wire right now. That's just temporary until I get some super glue to put that on

01:40:52.220 --> 01:40:53.220
there.

01:40:53.220 --> 01:40:55.140
No, I thought the original idea for this is that it was going to be something you were

01:40:55.140 --> 01:40:58.980
going to like have in a backpack or something and carry around with you. I guess that idea

01:40:58.980 --> 01:40:59.980
is kind of out the window at this point.

01:40:59.980 --> 01:41:05.620
Uh, that idea, that, no, what the hell. There's, to buy stuff to make your own, like, wearable

01:41:05.620 --> 01:41:07.460
PC is way too expensive.

01:41:07.460 --> 01:41:10.900
Because I was just thinking, my God, with a fan on the top like that, that's kind of

01:41:10.900 --> 01:41:13.180
dangerous, in a way, if you're not careful.

01:41:13.180 --> 01:41:17.460
Well, I'm going to have a grill over it, so that's not going to be a problem.

01:41:17.460 --> 01:41:19.700
Yeah, right now, though, it doesn't have a grill over it.

01:41:19.700 --> 01:41:23.020
That's the cool thing about this, though, is with the fan being right over,

01:41:23.020 --> 01:41:31.980
where the fan is located is right on top of the RAM and the north and south bridge on the motherboard,

01:41:31.980 --> 01:41:36.220
you know, the two main chips that they have on there to do all the processing.

01:41:36.220 --> 01:41:40.740
And then slightly diagonal of that is the processor,

01:41:40.740 --> 01:41:45.700
So all of the heat that's generally off of that is just shot out of the top like nothing.

01:41:45.700 --> 01:41:49.940
So this PC will not overheat at all, which is awesome.

01:41:49.940 --> 01:41:53.260
And then the hard drive is pretty large.

01:41:53.260 --> 01:41:58.380
It takes about half the Xbox case itself, and that has its own fan as well.

01:41:58.380 --> 01:42:01.580
I actually used the Xbox fan that was built into the case.

01:42:01.580 --> 01:42:02.660
Wow.

01:42:02.660 --> 01:42:05.760
Now, they're saying in the chatroom, Dark Knight says it would have been awesome

01:42:05.760 --> 01:42:09.100
if the Xbox boot-up screen followed by the Windows boot-up music,

01:42:09.100 --> 01:42:13.820
but you actually took the Xbox boot-up screen and that's your background on the PC, right?

01:42:13.820 --> 01:42:19.500
That is the background. Um, I can't get a very good shot at the picture right now, but, um,

01:42:19.500 --> 01:42:24.460
yeah, it says, uh, I'll, maybe I'll see if we can get in here, uh,

01:42:24.460 --> 01:42:28.940
well anyways, it says the Orange Box PC created by Loki. I'll post the pictures

01:42:28.940 --> 01:42:33.340
of that scene later, but, um, yeah, that, it is the actual, um,

01:42:33.340 --> 01:42:36.620
screen there, and I have a theme kinda going with it.

01:42:36.620 --> 01:42:42.120
This case that's in right now, um, actually, I'm gonna just probably just unplug this real quick.

01:42:42.120 --> 01:42:46.120
Are there a lot of people out there that have done this? Turned their Xboxes and gutted them and done PCs?

01:42:46.120 --> 01:42:55.120
There's, um, a few people that have, um, I've seen one that they've actually shoved a GameCube inside of an Xbox, as well as an Xbox.

01:42:55.120 --> 01:42:56.120
Interesting.

01:42:56.120 --> 01:43:12.120
Then I've seen people that have actually taken the whole Xbox stuff out, put it in a PC case with a Playstation 2, and also pretty much all the game systems all in one, which is kind of retarded, but whatever.

01:43:12.120 --> 01:43:21.120
And I've got to paint the case still for the modern orange as well to match the rest, but that's optional of course.

01:43:21.120 --> 01:43:27.120
Interesting. Alright, well thanks for sharing. Maybe we can get some clearer picks and put them up on our website, because we don't really use our...

01:43:27.120 --> 01:43:29.120
I can use the campaign for anything.

01:43:29.120 --> 01:43:30.120
We'll figure something out.

01:43:30.120 --> 01:43:31.120
Alright, we'll figure something out.

01:43:31.120 --> 01:43:35.120
Alright, anyway, we are going to open up the Skype line for some feedback, if you guys want to call in.

01:43:35.120 --> 01:43:39.120
If you want to talk about the Xbox PC, if you have any questions for Loki on that.

01:43:39.120 --> 01:43:45.120
Or, of course, we're willing to talk to you guys for a little bit about the Pump It Up news, about the DDR news, all that stuff.

01:43:45.120 --> 01:43:51.740
stuff, call in right now, www.orangelaundraider.com, click on the interact with us link for more

01:43:51.740 --> 01:43:54.560
information about how to get a hold of us through the Skype line.

01:43:54.560 --> 01:43:57.840
Meanwhile while we wait for that, because it takes a minute for the buffer to hit, say

01:43:57.840 --> 01:44:00.520
hello to Bugd, who just joined us in the studio.

01:44:00.520 --> 01:44:02.240
Hello to Bugd, who just joined us in the studio.

01:44:02.240 --> 01:44:03.240
How you doing, sir?

01:44:03.240 --> 01:44:04.240
Uh, naked hot tubbing, actually.

01:44:04.240 --> 01:44:05.240
What?

01:44:05.240 --> 01:44:06.240
Yeah, that was yesterday.

01:44:06.240 --> 01:44:09.480
I went down to San Jose and did some naked hot tubbing.

01:44:09.480 --> 01:44:14.200
Close your mouth, you're tracking flies.

01:44:14.200 --> 01:44:16.200
Run that by me again. Why?

01:44:16.200 --> 01:44:17.200
Why the hell not?

01:44:19.200 --> 01:44:20.200
Okay, whatever.

01:44:20.200 --> 01:44:21.200
There was a hot tub?

01:44:22.200 --> 01:44:23.200
I don't know. I don't know how to follow that up.

01:44:23.200 --> 01:44:24.200
Alright, let's go.

01:44:24.200 --> 01:44:26.200
Thank God we have somebody on the Skype line.

01:44:26.200 --> 01:44:27.200
Hi, you're on Orange Sounds Radio.

01:44:29.200 --> 01:44:30.200
Legend of Zaku here.

01:44:30.200 --> 01:44:32.200
Hello. Hello, Legend of Zaku.

01:44:32.200 --> 01:44:34.200
You're a little bit choppy tonight. What's up?

01:44:38.200 --> 01:44:39.200
Let me see.

01:44:39.200 --> 01:44:41.200
Yeah, the choppiness of my school's connection.

01:44:41.200 --> 01:44:46.560
connection, IRC basically kicking me out, you know, basically dying on me a few times,

01:44:46.560 --> 01:44:50.080
that's why they use a new program for IRC now.

01:44:50.080 --> 01:44:52.480
Well, life sucks, what's on your mind?

01:44:54.560 --> 01:45:00.400
Let me see, all this jive about people just, you know, being so pessimistic about, you know,

01:45:00.400 --> 01:45:04.960
can I make another mix, another arcade mix, that's just really, I don't know, that's kind

01:45:04.960 --> 01:45:10.640
of getting to me personally. You're just upset that people are pretty much writing it off and

01:45:10.640 --> 01:45:12.640
and people are saying it's never gonna happen?

01:45:12.640 --> 01:45:17.140
They're doubters. I mean, they're basically pessimistic as we speak.

01:45:17.140 --> 01:45:20.640
I'm not saying any names, but that's the mood I'm sensing right now.

01:45:20.640 --> 01:45:26.440
Well, you can't say that there's for sure never gonna be another Konami arcade mix,

01:45:26.440 --> 01:45:28.840
because there is one coming out in Europe. We know that much.

01:45:28.840 --> 01:45:37.040
Yes. If it does good, then, you know, Konami can rethink their plans of, you know, bringing it stateside.

01:45:37.040 --> 01:45:46.040
Is it possible there will be a new arcade mix? I say yes, but I just, I don't think we really know at this point what's going to happen.

01:45:46.040 --> 01:45:51.040
If it's going to happen, you know, tomorrow, if it's going to happen in the next, you know, couple of years, or what?

01:45:51.040 --> 01:45:53.040
And if this is a life-turning event for you?

01:45:53.040 --> 01:46:02.040
Well, no. No, but at the same time, it's kind of sad that, you know, DDR introduced me to all these people,

01:46:02.040 --> 01:46:06.480
and you know it gave me an idea for a radio show that you know we've been

01:46:06.480 --> 01:46:09.560
doing for the past few years and everything it's just kind of sad that

01:46:09.560 --> 01:46:14.360
DDR you know helped with all that and now the game is not happening and that's

01:46:14.360 --> 01:46:17.280
why people are so passionate about it. It's because people have been sucking

01:46:17.280 --> 01:46:22.520
down on Xtreme for about two years now. I agree that it's good that the longer it

01:46:22.520 --> 01:46:27.320
goes on the more that the other games like In The Groove and Pump It Up are

01:46:27.320 --> 01:46:33.400
gonna catch on so I agree the Konami shooting themselves in the foot but what

01:46:33.400 --> 01:46:43.560
can you do what what the hell I know I don't know what that noise was either but

01:46:43.560 --> 01:46:50.800
that's right um well you know I I don't you know as far as the petitions and

01:46:50.800 --> 01:46:55.640
things go that's all nice and dandy but I think it really sits in Konami of

01:46:55.640 --> 01:46:58.760
Japan's court and we're all basically their bitches right now until they make

01:46:58.760 --> 01:47:09.080
a decision well yeah but yes we do and he's but he you have to remember he's

01:47:09.080 --> 01:47:14.360
with Konami of America and as far as the American home versions are going they're

01:47:14.360 --> 01:47:21.980
freakin fabulous ultra mix 2 was a fabulous mix and a DDR 3 more fabulous

01:47:21.980 --> 01:47:31.060
A DDR Extreme, despite all the crap DDR Extreme got from some people, they tried something

01:47:31.060 --> 01:47:35.940
different, they tried a lot of new things, and for the most part it was pretty cool.

01:47:35.940 --> 01:47:38.500
And for the casual player, it was very cool.

01:47:38.500 --> 01:47:42.920
So as far as DDR home stuff in America, they're really not doing anything wrong.

01:47:42.920 --> 01:47:44.380
They're doing everything right.

01:47:44.380 --> 01:47:46.620
So you can't fault them.

01:47:46.620 --> 01:47:48.620
So I don't know.

01:47:48.620 --> 01:48:10.620
I know, I can accept that, but you know, come on now. Two weeks without a mix, there has to be something done. Anything. I don't care if you just make at least a faint action of just starting to make one. I would care as long as I know that you guys are thinking of something.

01:48:10.620 --> 01:48:22.620
Well, hopefully they'll give us a clue at some point, but anyway, Zaku, we're going to let you go because there's a bunch of people trying to get in, and you're kind of fading out anyway, so I've got to let you go, buddy, but have a good one. Thanks for calling. Later.

01:48:22.620 --> 01:48:26.620
Alright, let's pick up this one. Hi, you're on Orange Lawn's radio.

01:48:26.620 --> 01:48:28.620
Hey, Sky, it's Elmoet again.

01:48:28.620 --> 01:48:30.620
Hello, Elmoet, what's on your mind?

01:48:30.620 --> 01:48:37.620
Well, basically, Legend of Zaku was talking about how he wasn't going to name names while I was the other half of that argument.

01:48:37.620 --> 01:48:40.620
Okay, alright, so you want to give us the other half of the story here then?

01:48:40.620 --> 01:48:48.620
Well basically, all my other half was, is that I'm sure Konami would love to release another arcade mix here in the States,

01:48:48.620 --> 01:48:54.620
but then again, they're going to have to look at how profitable is it going to be for them at this point in time.

01:48:57.620 --> 01:49:01.620
I would think it's profitable, personally, but I don't know.

01:49:01.620 --> 01:49:06.980
I mean I don't have, I have a skewed perspective and I think we all do as DDR addicts, we think

01:49:06.980 --> 01:49:11.220
our game is perfect and it's making Konami tons of money and we don't really know.

01:49:11.220 --> 01:49:17.300
But when I see the imitators doing well, such as Pump It Up is doing so well that now they're

01:49:17.300 --> 01:49:25.740
going to do a home release, it kind of makes me go, hmm, if the imitators are doing well...

01:49:25.740 --> 01:49:31.380
That's true, but now that the imitators are moving to the home markets, I'm hoping that

01:49:31.380 --> 01:49:35.900
But this news about PuppetUp being released on a console in the U.S. is a huge wake-up

01:49:35.900 --> 01:49:36.900
call.

01:49:36.900 --> 01:49:41.500
But then again, the U.S. console scene is not where Konami needs a wake-up call.

01:49:41.500 --> 01:49:45.100
Because they're, as I said in the last call, they're doing everything right, as far as

01:49:45.100 --> 01:49:46.100
I'm concerned.

01:49:46.100 --> 01:49:47.100
So...

01:49:47.100 --> 01:49:48.100
That's true.

01:49:48.100 --> 01:49:49.100
That's true.

01:49:49.100 --> 01:49:50.100
They're not the ones that need the wake-up call.

01:49:50.100 --> 01:49:52.100
They should go out and release this to Japan.

01:49:52.100 --> 01:49:53.100
Right.

01:49:53.100 --> 01:49:54.100
I mean...

01:49:54.100 --> 01:49:55.100
The one thing that really...

01:49:55.100 --> 01:49:56.100
Which I guess they've done already.

01:49:56.100 --> 01:49:57.100
But...

01:49:57.100 --> 01:49:58.100
Yeah, most likely.

01:49:58.100 --> 01:50:01.740
Just the one thing that really gets me is that people are

01:50:01.740 --> 01:50:06.380
bitching and moaning, the U.S. needs a new arcade mix, when there hasn't been a new

01:50:06.380 --> 01:50:09.640
U.S. arcade mix in years.

01:50:09.640 --> 01:50:13.900
Well, that's a very good point, is people often confuse these

01:50:13.900 --> 01:50:18.620
Japanese releases that get imported as U.S. releases.

01:50:18.620 --> 01:50:20.180
Not only that, but

01:50:20.180 --> 01:50:25.140
we kind of shot our own selves in the foot as far as U.S. arcade games go,

01:50:25.140 --> 01:50:33.340
Because when DDR USA was released, the arcade version, it seemed more people wanted to play

01:50:33.340 --> 01:50:34.340
the imports.

01:50:34.340 --> 01:50:37.060
They wanted to play the ones with the 50, the 80, the 100 song.

01:50:37.060 --> 01:50:42.340
Well because DDR USA for the most part was crap, and so was the first home release, when

01:50:42.340 --> 01:50:43.700
you put it side by side with the import.

01:50:43.700 --> 01:50:50.140
But now, I trust Konami of America way more now than I would have back then.

01:50:50.140 --> 01:50:53.060
Because I would think that if they put out an arcade, like I said, I said this when Ultra

01:50:53.060 --> 01:50:57.900
Mix 2 first came out. Make Konami of Hawaii do the next arcade mix. We'll all want to

01:50:57.900 --> 01:51:04.460
have sex with it. It'll be beautiful. Look up with a different drum again. It'll be a

01:51:04.460 --> 01:51:07.020
beautiful mix. Nobody's going to complain.

01:51:07.020 --> 01:51:11.980
I agree 100% with you there, Sky. Anyway, moving off of this subject, the reason why

01:51:11.980 --> 01:51:17.960
I wanted to call was because of the new PIU North American release.

01:51:17.960 --> 01:51:20.600
Sometimes I'd just like to take the I out and call it P.U.

01:51:22.040 --> 01:51:24.040
Never mind. Anyway, sorry, yes, all right.

01:51:24.040 --> 01:51:24.540
You're funny.

01:51:24.540 --> 01:51:25.280
Yeah, I know.

01:51:25.280 --> 01:51:27.100
Who said there wasn't any comedy on this show?

01:51:27.100 --> 01:51:28.000
They don't pay me to be funny.

01:51:28.000 --> 01:51:28.500
Uh...

01:51:28.500 --> 01:51:29.640
I just got here.

01:51:29.640 --> 01:51:30.140
Pup...

01:51:30.140 --> 01:51:30.640
Pup...

01:51:30.880 --> 01:51:31.380
Yes, Bug?

01:51:31.380 --> 01:51:32.040
I-I just got here.

01:51:32.040 --> 01:51:32.540
Whatever.

01:51:32.540 --> 01:51:33.280
There's been no comedy.

01:51:33.280 --> 01:51:33.780
Uh...

01:51:34.480 --> 01:51:35.840
Pump it up in the U.S. What'd you wanna say?

01:51:36.540 --> 01:51:40.380
I wanted to say that I am a very happy person for them doing this.

01:51:41.320 --> 01:51:46.260
And I'm looking at the song list and it looks to be a very, very tough package to beat.

01:51:46.260 --> 01:51:51.740
there's a song list for the u.s. well yeah if you check down in the DDR freak

01:51:51.740 --> 01:51:56.180
thread if you check down like very low in the second post they've already

01:51:56.180 --> 01:52:03.140
released a song list it's going to be very heavily influenced by the Korean

01:52:03.140 --> 01:52:11.100
version the Korean home version it's going to be 85 songs tons of Banya

01:52:11.100 --> 01:52:14.500
There's gonna be tons of kpop surprise tons of Banya

01:52:16.260 --> 01:52:22.940
But there's going to be lots of kpop I'm there's there's you've heard that there's going to be some exclusive American content

01:52:23.300 --> 01:52:28.260
Okay, the kpop dwarfs that by like five or six times

01:52:29.020 --> 01:52:34.780
Interesting. I I'm still is it you're saying the song list is on page two of that thread is what you said page two

01:52:34.780 --> 01:52:39.820
Oh, there it is. I see it. Okay. Never mind. I got it. I see it. Ooh, we get starry on that's hot

01:52:39.820 --> 01:52:41.820
Yeah, definitely. That's an obvious one. That's been...

01:52:41.820 --> 01:52:43.820
Yeah, I know, but that song is so hot.

01:52:43.820 --> 01:52:45.820
NXT, NXT 2...

01:52:47.820 --> 01:52:49.820
Crystal Method, name of the game.

01:52:49.820 --> 01:52:54.820
Wasn't somebody... Somebody was saying that that song needed to be in a dance game for like the longest time.

01:52:54.820 --> 01:53:00.820
Was it you? I'm thinking Lanky style said it, but maybe it was you, Logy. I don't know.

01:53:00.820 --> 01:53:05.820
That's hot. Elvis, Little Less Conversation, which is funny, that's a DDR song.

01:53:05.820 --> 01:53:11.220
Let's Groove, not the DDR version, but the original Earth Wind Fire.

01:53:11.220 --> 01:53:13.420
And Rapper's Delight, Sugarhill Gang.

01:53:13.420 --> 01:53:14.780
What the hell?

01:53:14.780 --> 01:53:17.060
Hey, that's kinda hot.

01:53:17.060 --> 01:53:19.940
They're borrowing a lot from Dancing Stage, I can see.

01:53:19.940 --> 01:53:21.460
Interesting.

01:53:21.460 --> 01:53:24.260
Seems to be interesting.

01:53:24.260 --> 01:53:27.020
And then like just a whole shitload of Banya songs.

01:53:27.020 --> 01:53:29.420
Yeah, I've also noticed that

01:53:29.420 --> 01:53:32.980
we have about fifteen songs less so far

01:53:32.980 --> 01:53:34.700
than the

01:53:34.700 --> 01:53:38.640
Korean version and I think that's a pretty good move because it seemed like

01:53:38.640 --> 01:53:40.240
in the Korean song list

01:53:40.240 --> 01:53:43.960
they put all of their good stuff on one disc

01:53:43.960 --> 01:53:48.380
and I don't like that. If I see all their good stuff in one game

01:53:48.380 --> 01:53:51.800
it doesn't mean that, it probably means that they're not going to have a hell of

01:53:51.800 --> 01:53:54.880
a lot of good stuff for the sequel.

01:53:54.880 --> 01:53:58.000
My only concern with buying this game at this point is that I don't want to spend

01:53:58.000 --> 01:53:59.140
the money on the other pad.

01:53:59.140 --> 01:54:02.560
So this game better be well priced.

01:54:02.560 --> 01:54:10.560
But they say this is going to be bundled with a pad, so at least there's that.

01:54:10.560 --> 01:54:12.560
Well, I'm willing to check it out.

01:54:12.560 --> 01:54:16.560
I'm just happy that I get to play Turkey March at home.

01:54:16.560 --> 01:54:19.560
I'm not that fickle!

01:54:19.560 --> 01:54:22.560
For DDR, it's Moonlight Shadow.

01:54:22.560 --> 01:54:24.560
And, to a lesser extent, Un Deux Trois.

01:54:24.560 --> 01:54:27.560
For Pump It Up, it's Turkey March.

01:54:27.560 --> 01:54:37.560
You know what, and for me, it's Funky Tonight. I love that song. And Starry On. So I'm thrilled as hell about this mix. So that's cool.

01:54:37.560 --> 01:54:41.560
Thank you for letting, thank you for giving us a heads up to the song list there. I appreciate that.

01:54:41.560 --> 01:54:42.560
No problem.

01:54:42.560 --> 01:54:45.560
Alright, we gotta let you go on Mullet, but I'll let you work in a quick plug.

01:54:45.560 --> 01:54:49.560
www.insidepulse.com again.

01:54:49.560 --> 01:54:51.560
Visit it. Love it. Read us column.

01:54:51.560 --> 01:54:52.560
Exactly.

01:54:52.560 --> 01:54:54.560
Alright, have a good one. Bye bye.

01:54:54.560 --> 01:54:58.560
I'm all happy about Pump It Up now. That's pretty good.

01:54:58.560 --> 01:55:02.560
That is a way better song list than what I was expecting.

01:55:02.560 --> 01:55:06.560
Yeah, I agree too. I would read it all for you guys, but there's a lot to it.

01:55:06.560 --> 01:55:10.560
But basically, all those big Pump songs you guys know about, they're in there.

01:55:10.560 --> 01:55:14.560
Actually, I didn't see if Run To You was in there, but somebody in the chat won't tell me.

01:55:14.560 --> 01:55:18.560
I don't think so, because they took out the license for Run To You in C2,

01:55:18.560 --> 01:55:23.560
and they've probably been taking out the new license from DJ Doc itself.

01:55:23.560 --> 01:55:26.560
Maybe, I don't know, we'll see. Somebody in chat room will tell me, I don't know.

01:55:26.560 --> 01:55:27.560
We'll see what's up.

01:55:27.560 --> 01:55:33.560
Alright, um, why don't we get to the cage match? I will open up the skype line again a little bit later and show if you guys are interested in calling in,

01:55:33.560 --> 01:55:40.560
but for right now we're going to get into the Orange Lounge Radio cage match because we're running a little bit behind in show right now.

01:55:40.560 --> 01:55:45.560
So remember guys, if you want to participate in the cage match, you have to be in our chat room.

01:55:45.560 --> 01:55:49.560
www.orangeloungeradio.com

01:55:49.560 --> 01:55:52.560
and click on Chat

01:55:52.560 --> 01:55:55.560
and we're going to move into the Cage Match.

01:55:55.560 --> 01:55:58.560
The way the Orange Lounge Radio Cage Match works

01:55:58.560 --> 01:56:00.560
we play three songs for you guys.

01:56:00.560 --> 01:56:02.560
You guys vote on your favorite

01:56:02.560 --> 01:56:05.560
and the winning song goes into rotation all week long

01:56:05.560 --> 01:56:07.560
on Orange Lounge Radio's 24-7

01:56:07.560 --> 01:56:09.560
Bomani Music and More program.

01:56:09.560 --> 01:56:12.560
Last week in the Orange Lounge Cage Match

01:56:12.560 --> 01:56:15.560
Freezepoop, I'm sorry, Freezepop won.

01:56:17.560 --> 01:56:19.560
You have to hear all their songs, you need to get that joke.

01:56:19.560 --> 01:56:25.560
Freezepop, a favorite band of ours from Amplitude and Frequency and Boston,

01:56:25.560 --> 01:56:28.560
won with their song called Stakeout.

01:56:31.560 --> 01:56:36.560
Alright, well we'll see, will Loki be happy and Freezepop will be voted out tonight,

01:56:36.560 --> 01:56:39.560
or will I be happy and this song stays in for another week?

01:56:39.560 --> 01:56:41.560
We will find out, it's in your hands you guys.

01:56:41.560 --> 01:56:45.060
Here's a clip, because you only get to hear a clip, because it won last week.

01:56:45.060 --> 01:56:48.860
Remember, you can't vote until all three songs have played. Here's a clip of song number one,

01:56:48.860 --> 01:56:49.900
last week's winner,

01:56:49.900 --> 01:56:56.900
freeze-pop stakeout

01:57:19.900 --> 01:57:21.900
I'm on a stakeout

01:57:36.900 --> 01:57:39.900
I've got a plan in mind for you, I'm waiting till the time is right

01:57:39.900 --> 01:57:42.900
I know that you like what I do, no need to put up a fight

01:57:42.900 --> 01:57:45.900
Watching you from far away, you look so sweet and clueless

01:57:45.900 --> 01:57:49.900
Soon I'll move in on my prey, it's time for me to do this

01:58:02.900 --> 01:58:08.900
Watching and waiting, the feeling is elating

01:58:08.900 --> 01:58:10.900
I need my time

01:58:12.900 --> 01:58:16.900
Yeah, I know that you'll soon be mine

01:58:20.900 --> 01:58:22.900
Soon be mine

01:58:24.900 --> 01:58:26.900
Can't let you see me

01:58:26.900 --> 01:58:28.900
Can't let you see me

01:58:28.900 --> 01:58:30.900
Can't let you see me

01:58:30.900 --> 01:58:32.900
I'm on a shakeout

01:58:32.900 --> 01:58:34.900
Shaking and wasting

01:58:34.900 --> 01:58:36.900
I'm on a shakeout

01:58:36.900 --> 01:59:02.180
All right, song number one, a clip of last week's winner, Freezepop with Stakeout.

01:59:02.180 --> 01:59:05.740
Let's get into song number two, which is brought to us by Loki.

01:59:05.740 --> 01:59:10.380
Earth to Loki, what did you pick tonight?

01:59:10.380 --> 01:59:15.160
I picked this song by a group that sounds just like Echo Image, and they also have

01:59:15.160 --> 01:59:19.220
their group name is almost like Echo Image, it's Echoing Green.

01:59:19.220 --> 01:59:21.100
Okay.

01:59:21.100 --> 01:59:22.980
And this is the time of my life.

01:59:22.980 --> 01:59:27.780
Actually, it's the story of our lives. Whatever, story of our lives, time of my life, close enough.

01:59:27.780 --> 01:59:32.340
The story of our lives. Any reason you wanted to pick this?

01:59:32.340 --> 01:59:34.380
It just, I don't know, it reminded me of Echo Image.

01:59:34.380 --> 01:59:39.380
Alright, here it is, song number two, Loki's Pick, Echoing Green, Story of Our Lives.

02:00:04.380 --> 02:00:16.380
So we take our hopes and hold them away We'll change them to the notes of yesterday

02:00:16.380 --> 02:00:21.380
The chains of getting died

02:00:21.380 --> 02:00:27.380
Tonight, our dreams are in our sight

02:00:27.380 --> 02:00:31.380
Just when lifted out of nowhere

02:00:31.380 --> 02:00:34.380
With sunspots in our eyes

02:00:34.380 --> 02:00:38.380
We see the glory of our lives

02:00:38.380 --> 02:00:42.380
Our hearts are burning bright

02:00:42.380 --> 02:00:46.380
Just when lifted out of nowhere

02:00:46.380 --> 02:00:49.380
Our songs all stay behind

02:00:49.380 --> 02:00:53.380
To sing the story of our lives

02:01:06.380 --> 02:01:08.380
In this place

02:01:09.380 --> 02:01:12.380
Loneliness is never-ending

02:01:13.380 --> 02:01:15.380
Consenting

02:01:15.380 --> 02:01:19.380
We reached a bitter taste

02:01:19.380 --> 02:01:25.380
For now, the heart's way down with nothing

02:01:25.380 --> 02:01:30.380
Darkness gives our innocence away

02:01:30.380 --> 02:01:35.380
But now we're seeking light

02:01:35.380 --> 02:01:41.380
Tonight, our dreams are in our sight

02:01:41.380 --> 02:01:48.380
Cause when they're still not knowin' When the sun shines in our eyes

02:01:48.380 --> 02:01:56.380
We see the glory of our lives Our hearts are burning bright

02:01:56.380 --> 02:02:03.380
Cause when they're still not knowin' Our songs all stay behind

02:02:03.380 --> 02:02:07.380
But to sing the story of our lives

02:02:11.380 --> 02:02:14.380
The story of our lives

02:02:44.380 --> 02:03:03.380
She comes first as the moon She melts in my throat yesterday

02:03:03.380 --> 02:03:10.380
She's not getting tied to a knife

02:03:25.380 --> 02:03:28.380
Our dreams are in our sights

02:03:28.380 --> 02:03:40.380
Cause when the sun shines in our eyes We see the glory of our lives

02:03:40.380 --> 02:03:47.380
Our hearts are burning bright Cause when the sun shines in our eyes

02:03:47.380 --> 02:03:57.380
The pain of love we find, we hold the glory of our lives

02:03:57.380 --> 02:04:02.380
In the story of our lives

02:04:02.380 --> 02:04:12.380
Behold the glory of our lives

02:04:12.380 --> 02:04:20.380
In the story of our lives

02:04:50.380 --> 02:05:15.940
Okay, that was song number two in tonight's cage match, Echoing Green, story of our lives.

02:05:15.940 --> 02:05:18.220
Let's see what we thought of that here in the room.

02:05:18.220 --> 02:05:22.580
off with angel tonight I thought it did remind me a little bit of echo image

02:05:22.580 --> 02:05:27.700
I'll give them that um it's pretty good

02:05:28.540 --> 02:05:45.500
all right explicit all right bug what you give it a score on a scale of 10 all

02:05:45.500 --> 02:05:50.500
Alright, fine. Loki. Loki. I liked it, so it gets a 9.

02:05:53.500 --> 02:05:58.500
For once, I actually kind of like a song that Loki put in Cage Match a whole lot.

02:05:58.500 --> 02:06:03.500
But, I think it's a little long and it's kind of weird for Cage Match. I don't know if I could hear that on our station.

02:06:03.500 --> 02:06:08.500
But, I like the song, so I have to give it at least an 8. It's not like an 8 and a half.

02:06:08.500 --> 02:06:15.500
Alright, let's get into song number three this week, which comes to us via Dark Sakura, even though she's not here tonight.

02:06:15.500 --> 02:06:22.000
She still gets to put a song in, so here it is. She has chosen some, uh, Schwarzstein for you guys.

02:06:22.000 --> 02:06:26.280
hmm and I believe it's a band she put in cage match before but this is a new song

02:06:26.280 --> 02:06:29.640
it's called faster love and it's song number three in tonight's cage match

02:06:29.640 --> 02:06:31.640
Enjoy you guys!

02:07:29.640 --> 02:07:31.640
Oh

02:07:59.640 --> 02:08:04.440
No

02:08:29.640 --> 02:08:31.640
Oh

02:08:59.640 --> 02:09:05.520
He'll go onEN

02:09:29.640 --> 02:09:34.640
Oh,

02:09:34.640 --> 02:09:39.640
Oh,

02:09:39.640 --> 02:09:44.640
Oh,

02:09:44.640 --> 02:09:49.640
Oh,

02:09:49.640 --> 02:09:54.640
Oh,

02:11:24.640 --> 02:11:27.640
Not faster love. I fucked that up when I was announcing it. It's faster love.

02:11:27.640 --> 02:11:31.640
I have a strange feeling that Jamie picked that one on purpose with the holiday tomorrow. I don't know.

02:11:31.640 --> 02:11:33.640
Uh, Angel!

02:11:34.640 --> 02:11:36.640
It was okay.

02:11:36.640 --> 02:11:38.640
I'm just a little thirsty.

02:11:38.640 --> 02:11:40.640
Um...

02:11:40.640 --> 02:11:42.640
Geez. Seven?

02:11:42.640 --> 02:11:45.640
Alright, uh, explicit.

02:11:45.640 --> 02:11:49.640
We have that, um, gothic, gothic feeling.

02:11:49.640 --> 02:11:54.640
For some reason it kind of makes you feel like you're in a church listening to techno music, or...

02:11:54.640 --> 02:11:58.640
I don't know how to interpret it. It's a different type of style of music, but...

02:11:58.640 --> 02:12:00.640
I'll just give it an 8.

02:12:04.640 --> 02:12:07.640
I'd dub it Cher Takes Up Nose Whistlin'.

02:12:07.640 --> 02:12:09.640
It went on far too long. 3.

02:12:37.640 --> 02:12:43.460
Okay, like just maybe want to slit my wrist. So I don't know. I guess I would give it like a

02:12:44.500 --> 02:12:49.420
Six and a half seven. I'll give it seven overall. I mean, I like the music a lot

02:12:49.420 --> 02:12:55.120
It was just the guy's voice was kind of like oh god. I wow. All right. So remember though, it isn't up to us

02:12:55.120 --> 02:12:56.760
It's up to you guys in the chat room

02:12:56.760 --> 02:12:59.840
So here it is a recap and then you can vote song number one

02:12:59.840 --> 02:13:10.080
One you can vote for tonight is last week's winner, Freeze Pop with Stakeout.

02:13:10.080 --> 02:13:23.320
And song number two you can vote for tonight is Echoing Green, Story of Our Lives.

02:13:23.320 --> 02:13:25.340
And song number three you can vote for tonight,

02:13:25.340 --> 02:13:27.500
Schwarzstein, Festerlove.

02:13:27.500 --> 02:13:35.700
["Festerlove"]

02:13:35.700 --> 02:13:39.620
Alright guys, place, vote, now!

02:13:39.620 --> 02:13:44.100
Send a private message to Skye in the chat room with your vote.

02:13:44.100 --> 02:13:49.140
And we will tally all those votes up and let you guys know who the winner is very soon.

02:13:49.140 --> 02:13:54.140
In the meantime, Loki, what's going on in the sim scene right now?

02:13:54.140 --> 02:14:03.140
No, I'd hate to say this, but nothing, absolutely nada is happening in the sim scene right now.

02:14:03.140 --> 02:14:10.140
I can't even, I can't really even comment on anything that's going on, cause really there's nothing going on.

02:14:10.140 --> 02:14:17.140
Nothing, zip, no tournaments, no files, no nothing, just nothing.

02:14:17.140 --> 02:14:24.140
However, however, I will take this time to play you one little song. Because, this is

02:14:24.860 --> 02:14:31.300
a sim file, and yes, it's one of those ones I downloaded. Why? Because it says Max 300

02:14:31.300 --> 02:14:33.740
Remix. So why do I-

02:14:33.740 --> 02:14:35.140
I thought you hated those Maxes.

02:14:35.140 --> 02:14:39.680
I have to listen to every single one. It is my duty to listen to them, just in case there's

02:14:39.680 --> 02:14:45.940
a good one. And honestly, that happens every now and then. So, this song, for your listening

02:14:45.940 --> 02:14:52.940
pleasure is Max Vagina. That's right, Max Vagina. Enjoy!

02:15:15.940 --> 02:15:40.940
Oh yeah, you should have your voice in the cut, and then try to make it a little harder.

02:15:40.940 --> 02:15:42.940
Fuck man, I don't believe you.

02:15:42.940 --> 02:15:44.940
Take me in.

02:15:44.940 --> 02:15:46.940
All right.

02:15:46.940 --> 02:15:48.940
All right.

02:15:48.940 --> 02:15:50.940
All right.

02:15:50.940 --> 02:15:52.940
All right.

02:15:52.940 --> 02:15:54.940
All right.

02:15:54.940 --> 02:15:56.940
All right.

02:15:56.940 --> 02:15:58.940
All right.

02:15:58.940 --> 02:16:00.940
Let's do it!

02:16:28.940 --> 02:16:42.660
So yeah, that's what's going on in the simp scene right there.

02:16:42.660 --> 02:16:45.420
Uh, explicit, did you get a boner with that song?

02:16:45.420 --> 02:16:48.860
I was about to say that, no!

02:16:48.860 --> 02:16:49.860
It struck more.

02:16:49.860 --> 02:16:50.860
What the hell was that?

02:16:50.860 --> 02:16:51.860
Seriously, what was that?

02:16:51.860 --> 02:16:52.860
What?

02:16:52.860 --> 02:16:57.460
I can explain what that is.

02:16:57.460 --> 02:16:59.660
I know where the sources are from.

02:16:59.660 --> 02:17:01.620
Okay, first I take, wait a minute, wait a minute,

02:17:01.620 --> 02:17:02.860
wait a minute, is this why you had to give up

02:17:02.860 --> 02:17:04.060
the boner thing for Lent?

02:17:06.820 --> 02:17:08.580
I'm not gonna comment from that.

02:17:08.580 --> 02:17:10.540
It's not even close.

02:17:11.500 --> 02:17:14.600
There's no visuals, sound effects, okay, I can handle.

02:17:14.600 --> 02:17:17.180
I can hear, ah, ah, ah, all the time

02:17:17.180 --> 02:17:21.300
without getting a boner, but visuals is where it comes from.

02:17:21.300 --> 02:17:23.060
Anyways, back to the story.

02:17:23.060 --> 02:17:24.740
That was crap.

02:17:24.740 --> 02:17:26.580
I know the sources where it came from

02:17:26.580 --> 02:17:34.420
basically Max 150 sound effects and I think the sound effects that were like

02:17:34.420 --> 02:17:41.460
the porno sounds is from the video the porno video from City Crawford I

02:17:41.460 --> 02:17:46.580
actually have that DVD too it's from a song by a group called the porno rockers

02:17:46.580 --> 02:17:55.940
that's the group name yeah it's just like you know I don't know more like a

02:17:55.940 --> 02:18:07.940
I download that stuff just because, you know, it's fun to hear. You just have to listen to them, because you don't really realize how bad they are. But then again, those are funny sometimes.

02:18:07.940 --> 02:18:15.940
To the person who made that, screw you. Seriously, sorry, but what the hell was that?

02:18:15.940 --> 02:18:19.940
You can think, BanzaiGTV.

02:18:19.940 --> 02:18:23.940
Oh, I know, I've seen this guy remix, okay.

02:18:23.940 --> 02:18:31.940
And he has done other sim files also like Sabrina, a step file announcer, which is someone on um...

02:18:31.940 --> 02:18:39.940
But we have Paranoid Extreme, Rock Mix, Twinkle Twinkle, Shocking Star, the Sailor Moon theme, um...

02:18:39.940 --> 02:18:45.940
Yeah, he's got quite a bit of stuff he's done, but um... whatever.

02:18:45.940 --> 02:18:47.940
I don't know, I thought that was funny.

02:18:47.940 --> 02:18:52.940
This is why I stopped downloading stuff from Be Mighty Star, unless they're good quality.

02:18:52.940 --> 02:19:00.940
I'm sick and tired of seeing hearing max remixes that are cut and paste, more than I sound like too much cut and paste.

02:19:00.940 --> 02:19:04.940
All I have to say is dot dot dot.

02:19:04.940 --> 02:19:07.940
You guys want to find out who won tonight's cage match?

02:19:07.940 --> 02:19:08.940
You ready to know?

02:19:08.940 --> 02:19:09.940
Sure.

02:19:09.940 --> 02:19:10.940
Alright, here it is.

02:19:10.940 --> 02:19:15.940
Winning song of tonight's cage match as determined by your vote.

02:19:15.940 --> 02:19:25.860
Freezepop! Two weeks in a row, Freezepop wins tonight. Not very many votes ahead of the

02:19:25.860 --> 02:19:29.900
other two, though. Kind of surprising, it was kind of close. A lot more votes for songs

02:19:29.900 --> 02:19:35.940
two and three than I would have guessed from the initial chat room feedback, so some very

02:19:35.940 --> 02:19:42.420
interesting thoughts there in the chat room. Anyway, we're going to go to a break. I'm

02:19:42.420 --> 02:19:46.400
out of theme ideas for this break, so I think we're just going to play random stuff in this

02:19:46.400 --> 02:19:52.100
break. We'll come back after this with more Orange Launch Radio, including the FUs of

02:19:52.100 --> 02:19:58.380
the week. Want to do a little more Skype later on if we can, et cetera, et cetera. So in

02:19:58.380 --> 02:20:01.640
this break, we'll start off with the Shining Polaris. We haven't played this song in a

02:20:01.640 --> 02:20:08.640
while. We'll be back after this. More Orange Lounge Radio.

02:21:01.640 --> 02:21:06.640
The shine of my life

02:21:08.640 --> 02:21:13.640
The shine of my life

02:21:43.640 --> 02:21:48.640
If you will show me what you've got in your heart

02:21:48.640 --> 02:21:54.640
Let me know you're where you're at

02:22:24.640 --> 02:22:29.640
Make me do it any way

02:22:33.640 --> 02:22:39.640
I don't want to be alone

02:22:39.640 --> 02:22:45.640
I don't want to be alone

02:22:45.640 --> 02:22:52.640
I don't want to be alone

02:24:22.640 --> 02:24:29.640
Let's go!

02:24:29.640 --> 02:24:36.640
Let's go!

02:24:36.640 --> 02:24:43.640
Let's go!

02:24:43.640 --> 02:24:50.640
Let's go!

02:24:50.640 --> 02:24:51.640
Let's go!

02:25:21.640 --> 02:25:46.140
One, two, one, two, three, four!

02:25:46.140 --> 02:25:48.140
1, 2, 3, 4!

02:26:46.140 --> 02:26:50.140
It's good to know that love's not going to pass

02:27:00.140 --> 02:27:01.140
Let's go

02:27:01.140 --> 02:27:04.140
Like a sushi-style delight

02:27:04.140 --> 02:27:06.140
Like even falling like a light

02:27:06.140 --> 02:27:09.140
We're gonna all be together soon, right?

02:27:09.140 --> 02:27:11.140
Don't let me go

02:27:11.140 --> 02:27:14.140
Like a sushi-style delight

02:27:14.140 --> 02:27:33.140
It's time for the best part of Orange Lounge, this video starts!

02:27:33.140 --> 02:27:34.140
Holla!

02:27:34.140 --> 02:27:35.140
Stop!

02:27:35.140 --> 02:27:36.140
Stop!

02:27:36.140 --> 02:27:37.140
Stop!

02:27:37.140 --> 02:27:38.140
Stop!

02:27:38.140 --> 02:27:39.140
Stop!

02:27:39.140 --> 02:27:40.140
Stop!

02:27:40.140 --> 02:27:41.140
Stop!

02:27:41.140 --> 02:27:47.380
Hello and welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio episode 131 in progress we just

wrapped up the cage match we're gonna move into the FUs of the week however

02:27:50.420 --> 02:27:56.300
what we're going to do now is actually I wanted to talk to some folks some

02:27:56.300 --> 02:28:00.420
friends of the show because I figured you know it's Valentine's Day and this

02:28:00.420 --> 02:28:05.100
would be an appropriate theme to do right we're gonna talk to an actual DDR

02:28:05.100 --> 02:28:09.940
couple this is gonna be nice all right let's talk to them let me give them a

02:28:09.940 --> 02:28:14.660
call and see if they pick up. I think it's something to fit with the theme of the holiday

02:28:14.660 --> 02:28:17.660
coming up. One ringy dingy.

02:28:17.660 --> 02:28:33.300
Hello. Hello. Hello. Hi, is this Jason and Rai-chan? It may be. I think it is. It is.

02:28:33.300 --> 02:28:38.420
How are you guys? We're pretty good. Happy Valentine's Day a little early to you guys.

02:28:38.420 --> 02:28:39.420
Thank you.

02:28:39.420 --> 02:28:42.220
Now you guys are under the same roof right now, correct?

02:28:42.220 --> 02:28:43.220
Yep.

02:28:43.220 --> 02:28:44.220
Thankfully.

02:28:44.220 --> 02:28:45.940
Aww, so cute.

02:28:45.940 --> 02:28:49.500
Because now, for those that don't know, you guys are kind of doing one of those long distance

02:28:49.500 --> 02:28:51.140
thingy thingies, right?

02:28:51.140 --> 02:28:52.140
Yep.

02:28:52.140 --> 02:28:54.540
So you have to travel once in a while to see each other, so.

02:28:54.540 --> 02:28:55.540
Yep.

02:28:55.540 --> 02:28:56.540
That's what's going on right now.

02:28:56.540 --> 02:29:01.220
Well, with the holiday coming up, and I can't help but think of all those threads on DDR

02:29:01.220 --> 02:29:05.840
Freak that goes, oh my gods, how do I meet a girlfriend playing DDR?

02:29:05.840 --> 02:29:08.920
So I just thought maybe, you know, you guys could share a little bit about how you guys

02:29:08.920 --> 02:29:12.840
met and, you know, how it moved on, everything like that, if you could give us a little history

02:29:12.840 --> 02:29:14.840
of your guys' relationship.

02:29:14.840 --> 02:29:23.680
Well, see, me being a whole Southwest moderator, I, um, flirted over private messages.

02:29:23.680 --> 02:29:26.840
That's the way all girls' hearts don't, you know, I mean, come on, Rob.

02:29:26.840 --> 02:29:27.840
Oh, I forgot.

02:29:27.840 --> 02:29:31.280
Yeah, that's right, the moderatorship on DDR Freak instantly gives you a huge internet

02:29:31.280 --> 02:29:33.280
penis, I forgot about that.

02:29:33.280 --> 02:29:34.280
Exactly.

02:29:34.280 --> 02:29:40.360
basically the way we see it is just she uh we at southwest had a little what do you look like

02:29:40.360 --> 02:29:46.200
thread going and so she posted some pictures of herself and me being the good dutiful

02:29:47.080 --> 02:29:52.040
moderator had to tell her that hey right-hand your images are too big could you link them for me

02:29:52.040 --> 02:29:58.920
please and as soon as i did that i was rummaging around live journal and apparently she knew one

02:29:58.920 --> 02:30:02.280
friends as well. I saw her avatar in a picture,

02:30:02.280 --> 02:30:05.960
in a comment, and we just kinda started talking.

02:30:05.960 --> 02:30:09.320
And you actually forgot to mention the fact that

02:30:09.320 --> 02:30:13.040
in that PM it said, I hate to cover up such a pretty face.

02:30:13.040 --> 02:30:17.040
Oh, of course, you have to have them.

02:30:17.040 --> 02:30:20.400
Oh, that's so cute.

02:30:20.400 --> 02:30:23.280
Right now, what was your reaction when you got the private message? Were you like,

02:30:23.280 --> 02:30:27.400
ah, who's this weirdo hitting on me, or what? At that point, I didn't see it as that.

02:30:27.400 --> 02:30:32.400
It's kind of amazing because I was still, oh my god, it's the moderator, he's messaging me.

02:30:36.400 --> 02:30:41.400
So you guys didn't meet necessarily at an arcade or anything, you actually met through the online forums.

02:30:42.400 --> 02:30:44.400
So what was the first time you guys met in person?

02:30:46.400 --> 02:30:47.400
November 1st.

02:30:47.400 --> 02:30:49.400
Yes, the night after Halloween.

02:30:49.400 --> 02:30:52.400
How did it work out, how did you guys meet, how did it all happen?

02:30:52.400 --> 02:30:58.400
I was going to take a trip up to Colorado, and I did.

02:30:58.400 --> 02:31:00.400
It's just that simple, huh?

02:31:00.400 --> 02:31:01.400
Pretty much.

02:31:01.400 --> 02:31:04.400
Wow, well you make interviewing really easy then.

02:31:04.400 --> 02:31:07.400
I make it that easy.

02:31:07.400 --> 02:31:09.400
How long have you guys been together now?

02:31:09.400 --> 02:31:14.400
Officially, it would be a year and a month now,

02:31:14.400 --> 02:31:17.400
and that was only three months before when we first met,

02:31:17.400 --> 02:31:19.400
so one year and four months now,

02:31:19.400 --> 02:31:21.400
and one year and one month officially.

02:31:21.400 --> 02:31:39.400
Wow, how cute. So, um, so do you guys play DDR together or any of that dorky stuff? Or what do you guys, is DDR just kind of there? It's just an interest you guys both have? Or do you sometimes go out and do the nerdy bamani things together, like travel to arcades? Or what do you guys do?

02:31:39.400 --> 02:31:47.400
Yesterday we went to MGL. Well, most of Jason played. The night before that we went and played some 2DX.

02:31:47.400 --> 02:31:51.400
Played a little bit of DDR. Beat Mania 3, Dance Mania.

02:31:55.400 --> 02:32:00.400
She owns me in home versions. I usually do it a little bit better in the arcade, but not always.

02:32:00.400 --> 02:32:04.780
Oh that's kinda cute. Any plans for the big day tomorrow?

02:32:04.780 --> 02:32:08.380
Uh, going to work unfortunately for me

02:32:08.380 --> 02:32:12.540
but I'm gonna go in early so I can get out early and take her out to dinner or something really nice.

02:32:12.540 --> 02:32:18.260
Did somebody say fucking in the microphone? Shame on you, this is a family show.

02:32:18.260 --> 02:32:21.380
Bug, Bug just, was that Angel?

02:32:21.380 --> 02:32:24.620
Angel did that? No. It was Bug.

02:32:24.620 --> 02:32:28.660
Bug was whispering in the microphone, fucking.

02:32:28.660 --> 02:32:31.660
You probably just couldn't hear it.

02:32:31.660 --> 02:32:32.340
I see.

02:32:32.340 --> 02:32:34.020
That's none of your business.

02:32:34.020 --> 02:32:35.180
That's none of your business.

02:32:35.180 --> 02:32:37.580
Don't you know that's rude?

02:32:37.580 --> 02:32:38.500
Damn straight.

02:32:38.500 --> 02:32:41.020
Besides, we all know they're going

02:32:41.020 --> 02:32:44.420
to stay virginal until they get married, right?

02:32:44.420 --> 02:32:44.940
Yeah.

02:32:44.940 --> 02:32:47.740
OK, anyway, let's change the topic.

02:32:50.740 --> 02:32:51.500
Do you have any?

02:32:51.500 --> 02:32:53.660
I thought I already changed the topic right there.

02:32:53.660 --> 02:32:57.060
Do you guys have any advice for those guys out there

02:32:57.060 --> 02:33:01.300
that are all sad because of the Valentine's Day holiday and all they want is a gamer girlfriend.

02:33:01.300 --> 02:33:02.740
Do you guys have any advice?

02:33:02.740 --> 02:33:11.980
Stop whining, stop bitching, stop obsessing and be yourself and try opening your mouth

02:33:11.980 --> 02:33:14.300
and shutting it normally.

02:33:14.300 --> 02:33:15.300
And commit suicide.

02:33:15.300 --> 02:33:17.500
Amen to all that.

02:33:17.500 --> 02:33:18.500
Stop it, Loki.

02:33:18.500 --> 02:33:19.500
Stop it.

02:33:19.500 --> 02:33:21.300
Invite lots of loot.

02:33:21.300 --> 02:33:23.300
I don't know.

02:33:31.300 --> 02:33:33.300
Stop trying so hard.

02:33:35.300 --> 02:33:37.300
I don't know.

02:33:41.300 --> 02:33:43.300
Just don't be freakish about it.

02:33:43.300 --> 02:33:46.300
We've had some pretty freaky people come up to me, so.

02:33:47.300 --> 02:33:50.300
She's also had people try hitting on me. You or her?

02:33:51.300 --> 02:34:00.300
Well, they express their, uh, fads. I wouldn't say, no, not fantasies, but they express their heavy likes for me. Other guys, yes.

02:34:01.300 --> 02:34:04.300
And I apologize profusely about that, Jason.

02:34:06.300 --> 02:34:08.300
It's okay, Rob. We know you're all.

02:34:08.300 --> 02:34:16.300
All these nerdy people need to do is just rent a porno, get a nice dinner, and it's like a date right there.

02:34:19.300 --> 02:34:28.300
You know, sadly enough, they actually have DVDs out there, because I've gotten them free from...

02:34:28.300 --> 02:34:44.300
Oh, what is it? I don't remember the company. But anyways, there are these DVDs of, like, these women that, you know, pose for those, um, you know, like, import car magazines and stuff like that, and they actually have virtual dates as a feature on the DVD.

02:34:44.300 --> 02:34:46.300
So if you get one of those, you know, it's...

02:34:46.300 --> 02:34:47.300
Wow.

02:34:47.300 --> 02:34:50.300
For some reason, I failed to be surprised.

02:34:50.300 --> 02:34:51.300
Well...

02:34:51.300 --> 02:34:52.300
Tomorrow, I'm gonna send myself...

02:34:52.300 --> 02:34:55.300
I mean, I know it firsthand, though. Thank you.

02:34:55.300 --> 02:34:59.500
Tomorrow I'm going to send myself flowers at work, so I can look popular.

02:34:59.500 --> 02:35:00.500
What, Angel?

02:35:00.500 --> 02:35:05.780
I can send you some pies in Final Fantasy XI and be like, Happy Valentine's Day.

02:35:05.780 --> 02:35:09.420
Yeah, this Valentine's Day I'm going to spend some time with the one I love, so I'll be

02:35:09.420 --> 02:35:11.620
in Final Fantasy XI all evening.

02:35:11.620 --> 02:35:12.620
Okay.

02:35:12.620 --> 02:35:21.900
No, actually, I got invited to a gay singles dinner.

02:35:21.900 --> 02:35:25.900
And how gay is that in the overview?

02:35:25.900 --> 02:35:28.900
But yeah, definitely I'm going, obviously.

02:35:28.900 --> 02:35:32.900
One of my buddies is having it, so I'm like, okay, yeah, it sounds like fun.

02:35:32.900 --> 02:35:35.900
So there's something for everybody on Valentine's Day. What?

02:35:35.900 --> 02:35:38.900
I'm sure you'll have a gay old time.

02:35:38.900 --> 02:35:43.900
I will, and then I'm going to come home and masturbate until the sun rises next day.

02:35:43.900 --> 02:35:44.900
I'm kidding, I'm kidding.

02:35:44.900 --> 02:35:45.900
Thanks for the details.

02:35:45.900 --> 02:35:47.900
I'm kidding, I'm totally kidding.

02:35:47.900 --> 02:35:49.900
Anything else you guys want to share about...

02:35:49.900 --> 02:35:54.120
that much down below it shut up anything else you guys want to share any any

02:35:54.120 --> 02:35:59.560
exciting things going on this week while while she's paying a visit or for some

02:35:59.560 --> 02:36:02.520
reason I keep thinking she's gonna leave on Saturday but she's actually here

02:36:02.520 --> 02:36:07.620
until Tuesday and so that's me happy every day I think I'm oh you're cutting

02:36:07.620 --> 02:36:12.920
out for half that sentence so that's okay it's still cute all right I had to

02:36:12.920 --> 02:36:15.900
share a headset to the best of our ability oh I see that's cool

02:36:15.900 --> 02:36:20.900
Rai Chan, any plans for this week?

02:36:20.900 --> 02:36:22.900
Not really.

02:36:22.900 --> 02:36:24.900
Just enjoying each other's company?

02:36:24.900 --> 02:36:26.900
Just spend it normally, like our advice says.

02:36:26.900 --> 02:36:28.900
Okay, that's cool. Works for me.

02:36:28.900 --> 02:36:31.900
Alright you guys, thanks for letting us bug you, and have a happy Valentine's Day, okay?

02:36:31.900 --> 02:36:32.900
Thank you, Rob.

02:36:32.900 --> 02:36:33.900
You're welcome.

02:36:33.900 --> 02:36:34.900
Thank you.

02:36:34.900 --> 02:36:35.900
Bye, kisses.

02:36:35.900 --> 02:36:36.900
Bye, everybody.

02:36:36.900 --> 02:36:37.900
Bye-bye.

02:36:37.900 --> 02:36:38.900
Oh, it was nice to talk to them.

02:36:38.900 --> 02:36:39.900
What?

02:36:39.900 --> 02:36:40.900
What?

02:36:40.900 --> 02:36:42.900
None of us here are bitter, right?

02:36:42.900 --> 02:36:56.400
see single single single dating engaged so so we got mostly single but anyway oh

02:36:56.400 --> 02:37:02.520
well what we're gonna do now is we're gonna get into another segment I thought

02:37:02.520 --> 02:37:05.820
it would be very good to follow up the very lovey-dovey ah isn't that cute

02:37:05.820 --> 02:37:11.760
segment with one of our favorite segments the F use of the week so what

02:37:11.760 --> 02:37:14.140
What we're going to do now is get into those FUs of the Week.

02:37:14.140 --> 02:37:15.140
This is the part...

02:37:15.140 --> 02:37:17.680
Oh, by the way, if you guys want to send in an FU of the Week, just send me a private

02:37:17.680 --> 02:37:18.680
message.

02:37:18.680 --> 02:37:22.820
My name is Skye in the chatroom with your FU, but please try to keep it somewhat reasonable

02:37:22.820 --> 02:37:23.820
in length.

02:37:23.820 --> 02:37:28.660
If it's too long, I'm going to cut it short because I can do that.

02:37:28.660 --> 02:37:31.640
That includes you in studio, all right?

02:37:31.640 --> 02:37:36.580
So, this is the part where I would normally ask, Jamie, why do we do the FUs of the Week

02:37:36.580 --> 02:37:37.580
every single week?

02:37:37.580 --> 02:37:40.840
But she's not here, so I'm going to ask, Loki, why is it we do the FUs of the Week every

02:37:40.840 --> 02:37:59.960
single week. Because we have anger.

02:37:59.960 --> 02:38:04.560
Even though Dark Sacra is not here tonight, she's spending the time with her boyfriend.

02:38:04.560 --> 02:38:09.400
She did want me to enter in an F.U. on behalf. She would like to give an F.U. to people,

02:38:09.400 --> 02:38:11.280
in general, everybody.

02:38:11.280 --> 02:38:13.480
So there you go.

02:38:13.480 --> 02:38:14.900
That's alright.

02:38:14.900 --> 02:38:18.280
Loki's turn!

02:38:18.280 --> 02:38:23.440
Fuck you dude, the company that sold me the goddamn battery for my orange box PC

02:38:23.440 --> 02:38:25.340
because the battery is

02:38:25.340 --> 02:38:29.480
defective. It will not charge, in fact

02:38:29.480 --> 02:38:33.840
it charges according to the battery about only 75% of the way because only three of the four

02:38:33.840 --> 02:38:35.200
lights are on there.

02:38:35.200 --> 02:38:41.040
And, not only that, when I was trying to charge it and plugging it in, it's all sparky now, the little bottom thing.

02:38:41.040 --> 02:38:43.340
So that's probably not a good sign either.

02:38:43.340 --> 02:38:47.800
So anyways, so fuck you then, because that battery cost me almost $200.

02:38:47.800 --> 02:38:49.940
And that doesn't make me too happy.

02:38:49.940 --> 02:38:51.140
Um...

02:38:51.140 --> 02:38:55.380
And then finally, uh, fuck you to The Matrix Online, because...

02:38:55.380 --> 02:39:00.980
I went to go play it yesterday, just to give it a second, you know, go around, and um...

02:39:00.980 --> 02:39:08.980
It was admins only on that one server I was on, so I said fuck it, I'm tired of this, so I'm not gonna play it.

02:39:08.980 --> 02:39:19.980
And, um, sucks for me for not having any money, so, uh, fucking me for spending my money on useless shit that I don't need, um, aka, uh, the orange box.

02:39:19.980 --> 02:39:24.980
And yeah, that's pretty much it right now.

02:39:49.980 --> 02:39:55.020
judges or whatever so an F you to that an F you to the fact that I really didn't

02:39:55.020 --> 02:39:57.860
do a whole lot with my week but I had a really good weekend so I can't really

02:39:57.860 --> 02:40:02.300
complain it kind of leaves everything on a high note so I guess it's really it I

02:40:02.300 --> 02:40:05.620
don't have a whole lot else to vent about tonight so let's move on to our

02:40:05.620 --> 02:40:12.140
guests in studio we'll start it off with the ER angel all right F you to me for

02:40:12.140 --> 02:40:16.540
like not watching my book more carefully this week because I did get it swiped at

02:40:16.540 --> 02:40:22.000
least you know from 48 hours and I got all like paranoid and stressed and all

02:40:22.000 --> 02:40:30.440
that crap until the book got returned to me on Thursday and all that so screw

02:40:30.440 --> 02:40:39.840
that I've used to kthr closing down because you know it it was too soon in

02:40:39.840 --> 02:40:46.480
my opinion but you know there's nothing about now so whatever I'll live all

02:40:46.480 --> 02:40:52.560
you know, I'll move on. And, uh, fucking it being an I.L. because it just makes, you

02:40:52.560 --> 02:41:00.560
know, that alarm that much sooner to go off and it sucks, and whatever. Um, I guess that's

02:41:00.560 --> 02:41:07.560
about it. I don't really know. I lost my share of that, so I guess this doesn't even matter.

02:41:07.560 --> 02:41:14.560
Alright. So, whatever, I'm done. Alright, let's move on to Bug. Fucking to myself because

02:41:14.560 --> 02:41:18.560
I forgot who the vice used to be after funeral party on Tuesday night.

02:41:21.560 --> 02:41:23.560
It was Jagermeister.

02:41:23.560 --> 02:41:26.560
You're in trouble. No, that's alright. It's cool. I understand.

02:41:26.560 --> 02:41:27.560
But, uh...

02:41:27.560 --> 02:41:31.560
Too bad all those people aren't still in town, though. I bet they'd love to see me now.

02:41:31.560 --> 02:41:35.560
Most of them are. Most of them are, actually. Most of them didn't actually leak out.

02:41:35.560 --> 02:41:38.560
Oh, really? Oh, we should all hang out or something.

02:41:38.560 --> 02:41:40.560
We're gonna try. But, uh, uh...

02:41:40.560 --> 02:41:43.560
I'm a little different than I was in high school.

02:41:43.560 --> 02:41:47.560
No. No one would have guessed.

02:41:47.560 --> 02:41:49.560
Oh, your plane's showing.

02:41:49.560 --> 02:41:51.560
Oh, sorry.

02:41:51.560 --> 02:41:53.560
Uh...

02:41:53.560 --> 02:41:56.560
If you took the barrier, you'd be so damn far away.

02:41:56.560 --> 02:41:58.560
Yeah. Agreed.

02:41:58.560 --> 02:42:01.560
I just don't want to know about this naked hot tubbing stuff.

02:42:01.560 --> 02:42:02.560
Huh?

02:42:02.560 --> 02:42:04.560
Whose place was this at?

02:42:04.560 --> 02:42:06.560
I can't tell you.

02:42:06.560 --> 02:42:08.560
Okay, alright, fine.

02:42:08.560 --> 02:42:12.560
There was a dual G5 Power Mac involved here.

02:42:12.560 --> 02:42:35.660
power Mac okay hot all right yeah fair enough all right explicit I want to give

02:42:35.660 --> 02:42:40.420
an FD to some white Ford mistake we're trying to run my ass over when when it

02:42:40.420 --> 02:42:45.420
says walk on my on my part when I'm walking in this when I'm walking in the

02:42:45.420 --> 02:42:48.900
pedestrian no I should not be run over because just because you're in a damn

02:42:48.900 --> 02:42:55.740

02:42:55.740 --> 02:43:01.380
and f you to in Zuma 469 for causing a shitload of drama the tournament

02:43:01.380 --> 02:43:05.900
obviously you know if you can't stand it you don't like the rules don't don't

02:43:05.900 --> 02:43:08.780
even go to the tournament you send us to numerous tournaments and

02:43:08.780 --> 02:43:13.740
we're getting sick of it. You bring your drama personal drama that forced the

02:43:13.740 --> 02:43:16.540
team four six nine shouldn't even be involved and you bring it in front of our

02:43:16.540 --> 02:43:21.420
faces. Look what happens. Now you're banned. Luckily we did not kick

02:43:21.420 --> 02:43:26.020
your ass. I want to give an eff you for my video

02:43:26.020 --> 02:43:32.220
card from frying up like shit. Somehow like I think I started smoking my

02:43:32.220 --> 02:43:41.220
video card for Radeon 9800. I still have to fix the problem, but if I can't fix that I have to do it with it right now.

02:43:41.220 --> 02:43:47.220
And FU2 whoever turned off my fucking firewall, now I got a fucking virus I couldn't even delete

02:43:47.220 --> 02:43:53.220
until I do some very good research towards it. Because not even Attaware or any of those other programs

02:43:53.220 --> 02:44:00.460
could even take it out f you to whoever was spreading a fucking rumor about my

02:44:00.460 --> 02:44:03.660
family and stuff that someone said that one of our family members hate each

02:44:03.660 --> 02:44:07.500
other you know how much pain pain that is where the family if someone ever hears

02:44:07.500 --> 02:44:12.620
that type of shit towards it hurts a lot of tears have been going through that

02:44:12.620 --> 02:44:18.340
type of issue but luckily everything is solved and whoever said that have a shit

02:44:18.340 --> 02:44:25.300
should be killed if you to being broke as hell that spent a lot of money and

02:44:25.300 --> 02:44:29.740
and now I owe like some people for the tournament since that's what some people

02:44:29.740 --> 02:44:35.300
say that the tournament got rigged over prizes get the fuck over it a few to

02:44:35.300 --> 02:44:39.820

02:44:39.820 --> 02:44:47.660
that was me last week except not blackjack well in the fat yeah I lost I

02:44:47.660 --> 02:44:53.700
I lost fucking 90 bucks over a fucking blackjack itself because someone some people can't even play fucking blackjack pretty well

02:44:53.700 --> 02:44:55.700
They hit him when I'm not supposed to hit

02:44:56.420 --> 02:44:58.420
Okay, if you see a six on the field

02:44:58.460 --> 02:45:00.140
You're not supposed to fucking hit

02:45:00.140 --> 02:45:03.880
You're supposed to leave it stay because they know they're at the US and it's in trouble

02:45:03.880 --> 02:45:07.780
Yeah, you hit and they gave him 21 you get fucked over. Thanks a lot

02:45:08.780 --> 02:45:12.520
And since it is a three-hour show, I want to say to be continued

02:45:13.100 --> 02:45:15.100
my ink will never

02:45:15.100 --> 02:45:28.820
Alright, let's move on to the next segment, which would be the chatroom FUs.

02:45:28.820 --> 02:45:32.360
Starting it off with MPQ.

02:45:32.360 --> 02:45:38.100
In order of severity, FU to the laggy broadcast, FU to myself for inadvertently reformatting

02:45:38.100 --> 02:45:43.580
my hard drive twice in a week, FU to my parents for losing the wireless network password,

02:45:43.580 --> 02:45:50.020
And F you to my little sister for drawing on my laptop with a permanent marker.

02:45:50.020 --> 02:45:54.640
Dark Knight says I think this might be a running F you, but F you to Valentine's Day and being

02:45:54.640 --> 02:45:58.820
broke and single and having to work on Valentine's Day.

02:45:58.820 --> 02:46:04.260
Zaku says F you to being worried about getting work, F you to Valentine's Day for being so

02:46:04.260 --> 02:46:08.260
discriminating to singles, and F you to having to wait till I'm employed so that I can buy

02:46:08.260 --> 02:46:11.420
the Bomani hardware I desire.

02:46:11.420 --> 02:46:15.620
illusion says f you to valentine's day okay i've got two girls that were in

02:46:15.620 --> 02:46:16.780

02:46:16.780 --> 02:46:19.420
but they tell me this after they get a boyfriend what the fuck

02:46:19.420 --> 02:46:23.060
anyway i'm gonna draw my valentine's sorrow in a big tub of chocolate ice

02:46:23.060 --> 02:46:23.700
cream

02:46:23.700 --> 02:46:28.860
and multiple viewings of when harry met sally

02:46:28.860 --> 02:46:33.060
bs bx jason xd and right chance and they're together in the same place right

02:46:33.060 --> 02:46:33.860
now you know

02:46:33.860 --> 02:46:38.420
they said uh... i guess we could say f u to anyone in advance that f u's

02:46:38.420 --> 02:46:51.180
Valentine's Day. RPGKing7 says, if you do get this FU, an FU to all the employers that

02:46:51.180 --> 02:46:58.380
won't hire me. I'm desperate for a job, but not male gigolo desperate. And an FU to losing

02:46:58.380 --> 02:47:08.140

and dork says f you to valentine's day and girls insert frowny face here

02:47:35.200 --> 02:47:39.480

02:47:39.480 --> 02:47:45.520
f you to uh... valentine's day so yes hugs to dk

02:47:45.520 --> 02:47:48.040
oh well what just him

02:47:48.040 --> 02:47:51.820
i know i know a lot of people are sad about valentine's day though

02:47:51.820 --> 02:47:54.580
Okay, hugs to you too then. There. Better?

02:47:54.580 --> 02:47:58.100
Much. Okay.

02:47:58.100 --> 02:48:01.760
Um, let's see. When the hell is that you're watching, Loki? It looks like some

02:48:01.760 --> 02:48:05.480
public access production of Superman. What is this?

02:48:05.480 --> 02:48:09.100
It's the world's finest. It's a

02:48:09.100 --> 02:48:16.100
fan-made trailer for a movie that doesn't exist.

02:48:16.100 --> 02:48:19.300
Where do people get the time to do that? Seriously?

02:48:19.300 --> 02:48:24.300
I mean, I guess, but then again, this coming from a guy who co-hosts a three-hour internet show dedicated to video games.

02:48:24.300 --> 02:48:29.300
Well, this guy's actually trying to get himself, you know, work.

02:48:29.300 --> 02:48:32.300
It's a director that does the stuff, and he's done the same ones.

02:48:32.300 --> 02:48:38.300
He did another one called Batman Dead End, which was Batman vs. Alien vs. Predator.

02:48:38.300 --> 02:48:40.300
It's a little short. It was really well done.

02:48:40.300 --> 02:48:47.300
That was the one that was really cool in the beginning, and then when it was Predator-fied, I was like, this is gay.

02:48:47.300 --> 02:48:55.300
But they did another one called Grayson 2 which is supposed to be like Robin stuff. It looks cool. I mean they have like pretty cool people.

02:48:56.300 --> 02:49:00.300
It's better than your average fan film. Let's just put that one. But anyways, yeah.

02:49:02.300 --> 02:49:06.300
Interesting. Where can you download that? Is that like an ain't it cool news thing?

02:49:06.300 --> 02:49:15.300
I believe the Force.net has links to these. They have like a fan film link for like other stuff.

02:49:15.300 --> 02:49:24.300
You can also get some weird Matrix ones too, but like another one that's pretty cool is Matrix Run Program, I think is the name of that one.

02:49:24.300 --> 02:49:26.300
That was pretty well done too.

02:49:26.300 --> 02:49:39.300
So, this director's trying to find work, so what he does is he wastes tons of money making these fake ass trailers for movies so that internet nerds can get big boners over them. Is that correct? Except explicit.

02:49:39.300 --> 02:49:51.300
Exactly. Alright. Interesting. Alright, we're going to take a quick break and then when we come back, we're going to wrap things up.

02:49:51.300 --> 02:49:53.300
And please keep your boners secured at all times.

02:49:53.300 --> 02:49:54.300
at all times.

02:49:54.300 --> 02:49:58.300
And then there might be a few other surprises when we come back from break. We'll see.

02:49:58.300 --> 02:50:02.300
But no boners. So, yes, Logie.

02:50:02.300 --> 02:50:08.300
I mean, these would, I mean, obviously they're not theatrical quality, but I could definitely see this being like a TV movie or something.

02:50:08.300 --> 02:50:15.300
They really should let this guy make movies. Because I think they'd be pretty decent. I mean, they'd be better than like, you know, Lois and Clark and stuff.

02:50:15.300 --> 02:50:19.300
I don't think they should let this guy ever make a movie.

02:50:19.300 --> 02:50:26.300
They let the guy that made, uh, what was it, Unbow or whatever his name was, okay, they let him make movies. Why not this guy?

02:50:26.300 --> 02:50:34.300
Because I would rather Uwe Boll make movies than this guy because if this guy actually gets a deal and actually gets to make a movie,

02:50:34.300 --> 02:50:43.300
every freaking person on the internet will be turning out crap trying to imitate this. So sorry, dude, but, uh, hope it doesn't work.

02:50:45.300 --> 02:50:47.300
No comments to that, Loki?

02:50:47.300 --> 02:50:51.520
That was completely and utterly retarded your idea, I'm sorry

02:50:53.080 --> 02:50:58.440
Suck it. All right, we're gonna go to a break. We'll be back. I thought we could do some disco tunes in this break

02:50:58.440 --> 02:51:00.440
So we'll be back after this

02:51:28.440 --> 02:51:30.440
We're gonna ride for life

02:51:31.440 --> 02:51:33.440
Baby, ride for life

02:51:34.440 --> 02:51:37.440
We're gonna move tonight

02:51:39.440 --> 02:51:41.440
Let's move tonight

02:51:42.440 --> 02:51:44.440
Yeah, we'll ride for life

02:51:46.440 --> 02:51:48.440
Baby, ride for life

02:51:49.440 --> 02:51:52.440
We're gonna move tonight

02:51:52.440 --> 02:51:56.440
Oh, let this go

02:51:56.440 --> 02:52:00.440
Alright

02:52:00.440 --> 02:52:04.440
Oh, let this go

02:52:04.440 --> 02:52:08.440
Stand up, stand up, stand up, stand up, alright

02:52:08.440 --> 02:52:12.440
Let this go, try to get through

02:52:12.440 --> 02:52:16.440
Alright, alright, alright

02:52:16.440 --> 02:52:20.440
Let this go, say it shows

02:52:20.440 --> 02:52:25.060
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

02:52:28.160 --> 02:52:29.800
Break down

02:52:29.800 --> 02:52:31.960
With me and she

02:52:31.960 --> 02:52:33.760
Break down

02:52:33.760 --> 02:52:35.560
With me and she

02:52:35.560 --> 02:52:39.400
Here I am gonna stand my ground

02:52:39.400 --> 02:52:43.060
Nothing in the world's gonna bring me down

02:52:43.060 --> 02:52:47.060
Hit me, yell and give me roar

02:52:47.060 --> 02:52:50.400
I am something that you can't ignore

02:52:50.400 --> 02:52:54.400
I am here for all of us

02:52:54.400 --> 02:53:01.400
I am this and we're all so fabulous

02:53:01.400 --> 02:53:04.400
So free go, so beautiful

02:53:04.400 --> 02:53:07.400
So free gay, free go, so fabulous

02:53:07.400 --> 02:53:12.400
So free gay, free go, so free gay

02:53:12.400 --> 02:53:14.400
You're strong like a deer, like a deer

02:53:14.400 --> 02:53:16.400
Better be ready, gonna get your attention

02:53:16.400 --> 02:53:36.400
I'm an original baby, no carbon copies, a fake verse for me

02:54:06.400 --> 02:54:12.800
radio. We are back here on Orange Lounge radio

02:54:12.800 --> 02:54:17.960
about to wrap stuff up. But you know when we get towards the end of the show

02:54:17.960 --> 02:54:22.520
and we're running out of things to talk about, we always turn to the DDR community to

02:54:22.520 --> 02:54:24.200
find us some inspiration

02:54:24.200 --> 02:54:27.360
and of course we like to head on over to the biggest

02:54:27.360 --> 02:54:31.720
DDR site out there, the ddrfreak.com

02:54:31.720 --> 02:54:35.720
and we like to find ourselves the ddrfreak

02:54:35.720 --> 02:54:39.160
Post of the week, so we're gonna look at our DDR chit chat post of the week

02:54:42.240 --> 02:54:44.240
Did you do

02:54:45.360 --> 02:54:50.080
It was actually slim pickins this week there was really not a whole lot of newbie posts

02:54:50.080 --> 02:54:52.680
I mean there was some but nothing that hilarious

02:54:52.680 --> 02:54:56.960
So this is hard for me to make a determination, but I did decide on this this post here

02:54:57.360 --> 02:55:01.880
This is a post and it's called American songs are wrecking

02:55:02.520 --> 02:55:04.520
DDR um

02:55:04.520 --> 02:55:10.420
Um and the post goes like this um whose idea was it to put songs made by like

02:55:10.420 --> 02:55:17.840
Cher and Madonna in DDR unless you're a housewife these songs gotta go they

02:55:17.840 --> 02:55:22.300
didn't put max period in extreme u.s. and I didn't think they're making DDR anymore

02:55:22.300 --> 02:55:26.620
anyway mod chips are becoming illegal and buying another Japanese PlayStation

02:55:26.620 --> 02:55:30.420
2 will only cost too much and I can't play my Japan only songs because of

02:55:30.420 --> 02:55:34.460
stupid American songs not to be offensive I'm just saying that the

02:55:34.460 --> 02:55:39.100
American songs are stopping songs like Sakura and max period for making it into

02:55:39.100 --> 02:55:45.780
us DDR games I got a question does it really matter if a song is like 300

02:55:45.780 --> 02:55:50.260
beats p.m. or more because honestly everyone who complains about this is

02:55:50.260 --> 02:55:55.080
wants a max song in it or paranoia survivor paranoia survivor max into any

02:55:55.080 --> 02:55:59.140
of the u.s. releases of course everyone knows there's no paranoia survivor or

02:55:59.140 --> 02:56:04.140
and I don't know if you know about the Paranoia Survivor Max, like the Vulture Mix or the extreme series.

02:56:04.140 --> 02:56:09.140
Hell, Paranoia Survivor and Survivor Max are just sped up versions of the other song!

02:56:09.140 --> 02:56:16.140
Wooo! Paranoia Survivor and Wooo! Paranoia Survivor Max! Which is a sped up version of the song.

02:56:16.140 --> 02:56:24.140
Wow, that took a lot of work there. See, that's what's sad. People, you know, they probably looked at these people playing Sim Files and they're like,

02:56:24.140 --> 02:56:30.880
They like max 600s just sped up max 300. Let's do that with paranoid survivor. We have two songs for the price of one

02:56:32.540 --> 02:56:33.980
Exactly I

02:56:33.980 --> 02:56:38.660
Don't know about you guys, but I think DDR is all about fun and trying to play Sakura

02:56:39.080 --> 02:56:41.080
Heavy on a home pad is not fun

02:56:42.080 --> 02:56:44.080
dancing around to Sharon Madonna fun

02:56:45.800 --> 02:56:47.520
I mean, I don't mind about the song list

02:56:47.520 --> 02:56:51.880
But some people just have to get a grip that mix is not gonna have all ten footers

02:56:51.880 --> 02:56:55.880
Rob, that's just the gay in you, saying that.

02:56:55.880 --> 02:56:59.880
Hey! I like

02:56:59.880 --> 02:57:03.880
a lot of songs in DDR, not just the gay ones.

02:57:03.880 --> 02:57:07.880
So, Angel, your thoughts.

02:57:07.880 --> 02:57:11.880
You have any thoughts on this one? No? She's shaking her head.

02:57:11.880 --> 02:57:15.880
Okay. Instead she's giving me candy. Ooh, that's a very good thing. I like candy.

02:57:15.880 --> 02:57:19.880
Candy's a good way to make me happy. These little, like, they look like Pringles, but they're not. They're little chocolate chip things.

02:57:19.880 --> 02:57:21.880
Swoops, is that what they're called?

02:57:21.880 --> 02:57:27.880
Yeah, I mean, yeah, but related to my question, would anybody buy a mix that had

02:57:27.880 --> 02:57:32.880
70 paranoia and 10 maxes all in just one package?

02:57:32.880 --> 02:57:36.880
Yeah, yes they might.

02:57:36.880 --> 02:57:39.880
Cause, honestly.

02:57:39.880 --> 02:57:44.880
Seriously, why don't we release a home mix, and these are the songs we'll put in it.

02:57:44.880 --> 02:57:50.600
put in it we'll put like max period paranoid survivor max the max 300 mix

02:57:50.600 --> 02:57:54.360
from ultra mix to you know what fuck it we'll just license a whole bunch of

02:57:54.360 --> 02:57:57.980
nine-inch nails and the crystal method and all these really fast groups to do

02:57:57.980 --> 02:58:01.800
fast songs will license all their tracks and we'll put it in a home mix and we'll

02:58:01.800 --> 02:58:07.960
call good fucking luck mix playing this on your fucking home pad

02:58:07.960 --> 02:58:12.600
they could just do and fuse the song like everybody doesn't be my style max

02:58:12.600 --> 02:58:24.600
I hope you own a fucking cobalt flux mix, seriously, because that's the only way you're going to pass any of this shit.

02:58:24.600 --> 02:58:28.600
Or DDR controller mix. Button button revolution.

02:58:28.600 --> 02:58:31.600
Rape rape revolution. How rapey that is.

02:58:31.600 --> 02:58:36.600
Or America's Beatmania.

02:58:36.600 --> 02:58:41.300
go that's what you guys that have won it wanted a beat mania USA there you go

02:58:41.300 --> 02:58:45.600
they're just gonna release a DDR mix and have nothing but tens and 11s in it yeah

02:58:45.600 --> 02:58:49.600
they'll have 11 footers in it now and they'll call it beat mania USA there it

02:58:49.600 --> 02:59:01.280
is anyway I think that's gonna do it for tonight's episode of orange lounge radio

02:59:01.280 --> 02:59:06.520
so now we're gonna go around and get everybody's final thought oh I do want

02:59:06.520 --> 02:59:08.840
want to make a plug real fast though before we go around and get everybody's

02:59:08.840 --> 02:59:13.400
final thought the podcast our podcast rocks seriously you should download it

02:59:13.400 --> 02:59:17.080
although I do notice and if you haven't taken the poll that's on the main page

02:59:17.080 --> 02:59:20.240
of orange lounge radio.com yet in the upper right hand corner if you haven't

02:59:20.240 --> 02:59:23.040
taken that poll yet please do because it's helping us gauge a little bit I do

02:59:23.040 --> 02:59:26.960
notice a lot of you are saying you can't listen to the podcast because it's kind

02:59:26.960 --> 02:59:31.520
of complicated to set up and I would urge you to read through the

02:59:31.520 --> 02:59:34.560
instructions on our website if that's one of you that if you mark that answer

02:59:34.560 --> 02:59:38.640
or read through the instructions on our website under the Orange Lounge Radio To-Go edition

02:59:38.640 --> 02:59:43.780
page, it's really easy. All you gotta do is download a program called iPodter, and you

02:59:43.780 --> 02:59:49.880
can get this at, what, it's just ipodter.sourceforge.net, or even just put it into, like, Google, do

02:59:49.880 --> 02:59:54.120
a search for it. It's really easy to find, and then it gives you, like, a window in there

02:59:54.120 --> 02:59:59.680
where you put in a URL, just like a web browser. Put in our URL, it is super, super easy. Again,

02:59:59.680 --> 03:00:04.680
You do not need an iPod or any type of portable MP3 device to listen to the show.

03:00:04.680 --> 03:00:09.960
They only call it a podcast because it sounds cute and iPods happen to be popular.

03:00:09.960 --> 03:00:11.320
You don't need one.

03:00:11.320 --> 03:00:12.320
Logie?

03:00:12.320 --> 03:00:18.600
I did find one of the songs that could be on that, you know, Good Fucking Luck mix.

03:00:18.600 --> 03:00:19.600
Berserker, reality!

03:00:19.600 --> 03:00:26.120
What the fuck?

03:00:26.120 --> 03:00:30.120
And sadly enough, that is a sim file that can be found on BomaniStyle.com.

03:00:30.120 --> 03:00:34.120
I've seen a lot of realities, I just don't download them.

03:00:34.120 --> 03:00:38.120
You know what? We'll just let DM Ashura do all the music.

03:00:38.120 --> 03:00:42.120
And then, you know what? DM Ashura will do all the music,

03:00:42.120 --> 03:00:46.120
and then, um, who's that

03:00:46.120 --> 03:00:50.120
kid that does all the crazy-ass Oni steps?

03:00:50.120 --> 03:00:54.120
Everybody gets a big boner except for you when he releases a new sim file.

03:00:54.120 --> 03:00:58.120
What is his name? And then he retired, came back.

03:00:58.120 --> 03:01:02.120
No! What is it? Bimani ruler?

03:01:02.120 --> 03:01:06.120
He can do all the steps.

03:01:06.120 --> 03:01:10.120
Oh god. I don't even think he cares about zip files anymore.

03:01:10.120 --> 03:01:14.120
Good for him. Alright. Obviously. Alright, now let's go around and get everybody's

03:01:14.120 --> 03:01:18.120
final thought. Bug, your final thought. Naked hot tummy.

03:01:18.120 --> 03:01:22.120
Explicit, your final thought.

03:01:22.120 --> 03:01:26.120
I survived the anti-boner lent, so far.

03:01:26.120 --> 03:01:26.620
So far.

03:01:26.620 --> 03:01:29.120
So don't send me any more porn or anything like that.

03:01:29.120 --> 03:01:31.120
And what is your email address?

03:01:31.120 --> 03:01:32.120
Huh?

03:01:32.120 --> 03:01:33.120
What is your email address?

03:01:33.120 --> 03:01:36.120

03:01:36.120 --> 03:01:38.120
Just look up his profile on DDR3.

03:01:38.120 --> 03:01:40.120
Angel, your final thought?

03:01:40.120 --> 03:01:46.120
Need more time in a week to play, um, Final Fantasy XI. Yeah.

03:01:46.120 --> 03:01:51.520

03:01:51.520 --> 03:01:54.560

03:02:17.040 --> 03:02:22.520
