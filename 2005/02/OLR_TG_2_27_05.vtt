00:19.780 --> 00:21.200
Loki

00:21.200 --> 00:23.200
Hello again, everybody

00:23.460 --> 00:27.480
Welcome to another edition of the orange lounge radio to go edition our

00:27.480 --> 00:32.080
podcast where we get to talk to you about video games that don't suck and

00:32.080 --> 00:36.280
honestly a few that do suck sometimes they just slip in there by chance

00:36.280 --> 00:41.560
joining me as always my lovely co-host say hello to dark Sakura Jamie such as

00:41.560 --> 00:48.320
relative it is what I may think sucks you may think not sucks like freeze pop

00:48.320 --> 00:53.840
don't go there don't go there with me also with us as always the lovable Loki

00:53.840 --> 01:01.700
yes I am you sure are yes I am all right um so let's get right into it what kind

01:01.700 --> 01:05.300
of games you've been playing this week what even up to Jamie lots of Final

01:05.300 --> 01:10.060
Fantasy 11 because that's all I've been conscious for I've been oh yes you've

01:10.060 --> 01:14.700
been battling the to sickness this week so disease and that does it kind of help

01:14.700 --> 01:19.340
you to just sit there and veg out to the role-playing you're like slash slash

01:19.340 --> 01:25.280
cure cure in your case cure cure actually in my case it's been the order

01:25.280 --> 01:33.840
is blind you get your system worked out yeah yeah I have my system worked out

01:33.840 --> 01:37.040
sadly but you're much farther in the game this time than you were the first

01:37.040 --> 01:42.960
time around so yeah I hit level 10 on my sub job what do you think is doing it

01:42.960 --> 01:46.100
for you just the fact that you have more people to play with this time or the

01:46.100 --> 01:52.660
fact that I just have people to play with, in general, since I maybe played for three

01:52.660 --> 01:55.660
months and played with people all of twice.

01:55.660 --> 02:01.940
Okay, alright, so that's it, just Final Fantasy XI?

02:01.940 --> 02:03.700
And some guitar freaks.

02:03.700 --> 02:06.460
Very cool, just for the heck of it.

02:06.460 --> 02:07.860
Because Dan wanted to play.

02:07.860 --> 02:08.860
That's a good reason.

02:08.860 --> 02:10.900
Alright, Loki, what have you been playing?

02:10.900 --> 02:17.540
I played, well I started off the week trying to get some other games, I played a little

02:17.540 --> 02:24.660
bit of Final Fantasy featuring Charlie's Angels, I mean Final Fantasy X-2, and that lost my

02:24.660 --> 02:26.660
interest really quick.

02:26.660 --> 02:33.380
Just too annoying, honestly the voice acting drove me away, it was just, ah, scary.

02:33.380 --> 02:38.740
I couldn't possibly go through that game anymore with Riku yelling some really weird shit,

02:38.740 --> 02:39.740
it's not for me.

02:39.740 --> 02:43.940
So then I went and played a little bit of Derby Owners Club and my horse, i.e.

02:43.940 --> 02:46.340
Children, is doing very well.

02:46.340 --> 02:49.580
Now explain, some folks out there may have never heard of Derby Owners Club because this

02:49.580 --> 02:51.680
podcast goes to a slightly different audience.

02:51.680 --> 02:52.900
What is Derby Owners Club all about?

02:52.900 --> 02:55.140
Derby Owners Club is this game made by Sega.

02:55.140 --> 02:59.620
It's giant, it's huge, it's a good $100,000 cabinet.

02:59.620 --> 03:05.660
Basically what you do is you race and race racing horses and it's pretty much got the

03:05.660 --> 03:11.100
whole jockey thing you train your horses and you you know do the large races and

03:11.100 --> 03:15.760
it's all these two giant screens and you can actually later on the game you can

03:15.760 --> 03:20.000
actually retire your horses breed them together and it all uses those magnetic

03:20.000 --> 03:24.820
cards that you might have seen on like you know initial DM you know f0 GX that

03:24.820 --> 03:29.940
type of thing hmm I should scan some of my cards for our listeners you shouldn't

03:29.940 --> 03:34.660
put them on the way because not a lot of people have seen this game I have a

03:34.660 --> 03:39.060
horse named Britney Spears somewhere. She might still be in my wallet. I remember Polteri. Yes, I had a horse named

03:39.060 --> 03:46.660
Polteri as well. I have Magical Sound, who's retired. I have Last Message and Shiroi that's an all-white horse, which is

03:46.660 --> 03:56.660
like one of the rarest ones. And I have Gongoro, who's a panda. I also had a horse named George Bush at one point. Yes. Because, you know, so I could whip him. This is fun.

03:56.660 --> 04:03.660
The other horse racing game I like was Daytona. Remember Daytona and the horse code that they had?

04:03.660 --> 04:11.660
What was the game that they used to have at the bowling alley here in town where you would ride the horse humping machine? What was that?

04:11.660 --> 04:13.660
That was Final Furlong.

04:13.660 --> 04:16.660
Final Furlong! Oh god, that game was hilarious.

04:16.660 --> 04:19.660
I think they still have that game to be honest.

04:19.660 --> 04:20.660
Really?

04:20.660 --> 04:21.660
I didn't see it when I was there a couple weeks ago.

04:21.660 --> 04:26.780
Well, I know they had it at one time they had it at Paradise Island the other arcade near us

04:26.780 --> 04:31.820
Oh, I remember seeing that but I remember the first time I played them like this looks like fun

04:31.820 --> 04:35.720
And it just looks like you're humping the horse. It's just the weirdest thing

04:35.720 --> 04:39.740
There's only a few arcade games and when I watch people play it, they make me giggle every time

04:39.740 --> 04:41.860
That's one of them and prop cycles the other ones

04:42.980 --> 04:45.180
Prop cycles cool though. That's like a good laugh

04:45.180 --> 04:47.500
I'm on I like when it's I want to sit

04:47.500 --> 04:53.140
Kind of position myself next to the back of the bike and like feel the breeze especially after a game of DDR

04:53.140 --> 04:58.580
You know, I worked at a Namco arcade when prop cycle came out. Well, that's my boss. I would get there early to play it

04:58.580 --> 05:04.620
I actually do have prop cycle in the main cabinet and sadly enough something is lost in the transition

05:04.620 --> 05:10.820
It's absolutely it is not the same prop cycles one of those games. It cannot be emulated because it's not exercise bike to it

05:10.820 --> 05:14.180
Maybe now that would work. It doesn't work too. Well, it's kind of

05:14.180 --> 05:20.860
of laggy, very very laggy. Well, technology will get better eventually, but it's a great

05:20.860 --> 05:24.420
game. But it just makes me giggle because you've got this person on the bike pedaling

05:24.420 --> 05:26.820
around. It's just a funny thing to see in our game. What about the rowing game at Dave

05:26.820 --> 05:30.860
and Busters? That is very cool. I don't even remember the name of that game. It's just

05:30.860 --> 05:37.820
the rowing game. They have that also at Paradise Island. Wow. That's a lot of fun to play,

05:37.820 --> 05:41.500
especially when you've been drinking. God bless Dave and Busters, a place where you

05:41.500 --> 05:44.560
can drink and then play games even though the games are extremely overpriced

05:44.560 --> 05:48.220
as are the drinks still fun one thing though in the defensive final for long

05:48.220 --> 05:53.740
is that it's a really good out workout it is I got very tired playing that game

05:53.740 --> 05:56.700
all right anything else you've been playing besides Derby owners club and

05:56.700 --> 06:04.080
your horse I eat children um see what else have I been playing really I

06:04.080 --> 06:09.260
haven't played anything other than that I don't think oh we played a little bit

06:09.260 --> 06:12.920
the guy game this week. Oh damn you, I was going to bring that up. Me and Loki were playing

06:12.920 --> 06:18.280
the guy game this week. Well, I'll let you talk about it. All I will say is I played

06:18.280 --> 06:24.420
the game. Alright, I'll fit in. I was playing the game and you know, some folks may be surprised

06:24.420 --> 06:27.480
by that statement because I know the rumors that are going around about me and they're

06:27.480 --> 06:33.840
all true. But you know what? Playing those kinds of games are fun once in a while, dammit.

06:33.840 --> 06:37.640
You know, you get to see boobs and that's funny. So we were playing this game and man,

06:37.640 --> 06:41.840
The girl that I decided to play as, she was so ugly.

06:41.840 --> 06:43.440
So ugly.

06:43.440 --> 06:47.620
And I won, so my girl got to do a lap dance at the end, and everybody was like, God no!

06:47.620 --> 06:54.280
As I put it earlier in the other show, she was a cross between, um, I would say Tori

06:54.280 --> 06:56.760
Spelling and Bea Arthur.

06:56.760 --> 06:58.760
So it was China?

06:58.760 --> 07:01.240
Kind of, except like, you know, with blonde.

07:01.240 --> 07:03.500
She had the Tori Spelling horse face.

07:03.500 --> 07:07.220
there's this one thing picture of her where she's wearing like an orange 90

07:07.220 --> 07:11.420
and it looks like she just ate a baby it really does because she spread it out

07:11.420 --> 07:16.500
it's sort of like the color because it was like it wasn't too crisp of color it

07:16.500 --> 07:21.300
kind of matched her skin color so it looked like she just blew up and I

07:21.300 --> 07:25.700
remember exclaiming oh my god she exploded and Loki's girlfriend was just

07:25.700 --> 07:32.500
in stitches for like 15 minutes was funny so was I I was it was funny too

07:32.500 --> 07:35.000
bad there's not gonna be a sequel because that lawsuit and everything

07:35.000 --> 07:41.020
makes me sad I'm sure there will be the lawsuit I bet you because they'll

07:41.020 --> 07:46.540
probably say oh well you know breach of contract or whatever you know or there's

07:46.540 --> 07:50.660
got to be some sort of protection do breach of contract because any contract

07:50.660 --> 07:56.780
created with a minor is how would you I mean how what kind of protection do

07:56.780 --> 08:00.340
companies have against people that are going to matter to them the contract is

08:00.340 --> 08:04.500
still voidable whether they know the age or not if they are of the age of minority within

08:04.500 --> 08:10.120
their state then there is no there technically is no contract that's true legally there is

08:10.120 --> 08:14.240
not a contract I think they could probably still sue them they can't see there but they

08:14.240 --> 08:19.840
could they can take a suit of there is a suit they could probably take against their parents

08:19.840 --> 08:26.520
for allowing the unless she's emancipated but exactly it would be her parents responsibility

08:26.520 --> 08:30.040
for letting her go to the spring break, I think, and publicly flash people.

08:30.040 --> 08:34.000
And I'm sure they could also, you know, bring up some sort of, well, I don't know, I don't

08:34.000 --> 08:35.000
know.

08:35.000 --> 08:36.000
Doesn't that be child endangerment?

08:36.000 --> 08:41.720
They can't really go against the parents, um, except for, perhaps, expenses, but that's

08:41.720 --> 08:42.720
not really it.

08:42.720 --> 08:44.500
Um, legally, though, there's nothing the company can do.

08:44.500 --> 08:45.500
They were in the wrong.

08:45.500 --> 08:46.500
Hmm.

08:46.500 --> 08:49.200
I don't know, but couldn't they, like, you know, take losses or something?

08:49.200 --> 08:53.060
Couldn't they blame the losses of this game because they had to pull it off the shelves

08:53.060 --> 08:54.200
out on these parents?

08:54.200 --> 08:58.280
You know what, long story short, it's too hard to see the boobs in that game anyway.

08:58.280 --> 09:00.920
Seriously, you gotta cheat if you really want to see the boobs.

09:00.920 --> 09:03.880
So you know, I mean, come on, you're not ever gonna see this.

09:03.880 --> 09:08.720
I didn't even realize it though, when we played, you know, yesterday, I thought there was like

09:08.720 --> 09:13.220
three different sets of pictures, then I went and scrolled down, there was like a good seven

09:13.220 --> 09:17.480
or eight sets, I'm like, holy crap, I'm like, I have to go through all of this.

09:17.480 --> 09:18.800
Yeah, that was a lot of boobs.

09:18.800 --> 09:20.600
Alright, let's move on.

09:20.600 --> 09:24.760
Let's change the topic to something else that is completely on another topic, completely

09:24.760 --> 09:28.120
from boobs to the family-friendly Nintendo.

09:28.120 --> 09:31.360
Now we've kind of been speculating that Nintendo's going to do this for quite some time, but

09:31.360 --> 09:35.360
they're actually going to do this new thing with the DS, and they're going to start testing

09:35.360 --> 09:41.340
this in Japan, where you can actually use these kiosks in selected stores around Japan,

09:41.340 --> 09:46.600
and you can download things to your DS, which, you know, duh, we kind of suspected something

09:46.600 --> 09:50.900
like this would happen for a while it's just a you know an obvious side effect

09:50.900 --> 09:54.420
of the technology it is an awesome idea and this is the cool thing you're gonna

09:54.420 --> 09:58.980
be able to download demos onto your DS so if you ever walked in to like a

09:58.980 --> 10:02.380
GameStop and you've been wanting to play the demo that's there but some damn

10:02.380 --> 10:05.540
seven-year-old kids been sitting on there for the past two hours and while

10:05.540 --> 10:08.540
his mom's in Victoria's Secret or something left her kid in GameStop and

10:08.540 --> 10:11.980
you've been wanting to play the demo but the damn kid won't get off well now you

10:11.980 --> 10:15.260
won't have to worry about that stuff anymore you just download the DS demo

10:15.260 --> 10:17.980
right under your DS and you could just walk out the store and play it in the

10:17.980 --> 10:21.380
food court as long as you don't turn your DS off you could still have that

10:21.380 --> 10:26.620
demo they actually sort of did that with the GBA like in Animal Crossing kind of

10:26.620 --> 10:32.020
yeah could play the game on your on your GBA but you know if you turned it off

10:32.020 --> 10:34.780
you lost it of course and that's probably where this idea started to

10:34.780 --> 10:38.020
stem from because unfortunately you had to have the GameCube and the wire and

10:38.020 --> 10:42.180
everything but now that we got bluetooth and wireless hey that is also from what

10:42.180 --> 10:45.920
I hear that's what they're doing with the Nintendo Revolution system, the brand new

10:45.920 --> 10:50.160
console system that they're going to be unveiling, is the connectivity with that is going to

10:50.160 --> 10:54.120
be similar to what the advance was with the GameCube.

10:54.120 --> 11:00.080
I would be shocked, I would be absolutely shocked if the Revolution did not have some

11:00.080 --> 11:03.880
type of Bluetooth thing that will communicate with the DS.

11:03.880 --> 11:09.080
Well they were talking about what was, I think it was either a PS3 or Xbox 360 or 2 or whatever

11:09.080 --> 11:13.640
the hell they're calling it now, where they were seeing that out of the box, I think it

11:13.640 --> 11:19.520
was the Xbox, that all their controllers are wireless. They're all going to be wireless.

11:19.520 --> 11:23.520
Well that's not a bad idea either, honestly. It's time for that to happen too. So we can

11:23.520 --> 11:27.640
lose the controllers right along with the remotes, honestly. It's time for that to start

11:27.640 --> 11:34.120
happening. What's also interesting is the game Jam with the Band. There's this game

11:34.120 --> 11:37.240
they have in Japan. They don't have it here yet. I don't remember if they have plans to

11:37.240 --> 11:40.720
bring this over here yet or not but you can actually download additional music

11:40.720 --> 11:47.000
for this game via the kiosks so and it saves to your DS somehow and I never

11:47.000 --> 11:50.280
knew the DS had a type of drive in it but it must have some type of memory

11:50.280 --> 11:54.320
flash or something because the information will actually save but I

11:54.320 --> 11:58.520
guess if you think about it Loki aren't the games just on flashcards anyway so

11:58.520 --> 12:02.460
maybe when you're downloading the information it's going right onto the

12:02.460 --> 12:06.740
game. I have no idea how that works. Enlighten me, Tecmasa.

12:06.740 --> 12:10.100
I have no idea. I'm sorry, I'm being distracted by Tekken 5 here. Okay, we're gonna turn that

12:10.100 --> 12:15.500
off. That's alright. Alright. Well then I suppose we will get into Tekken 5 news. Let's

12:15.500 --> 12:21.540
talk about Tekken 5. Tekken 5 is out? It really just kinda came out in the middle of nowhere.

12:21.540 --> 12:27.260
Like I remember mentioning it. It came out Friday. But really, it was like, dang, all

12:27.260 --> 12:34.420
sudden Tekken 5 is out. And here's the crazy thing about Tekken 5. It's got Tekken 1, 2,

12:34.420 --> 12:43.400
and 3 all in it. And, and, and, and Star Blade. That's so cool. You know how I think it was

12:43.400 --> 12:50.920
Tekken, the first Tekken or Tekken 2 had like a Galaga. Yeah. For the loading game. That's

12:50.920 --> 12:51.920
That's right.

12:51.920 --> 12:53.560
And has freakin' Starblade as the loading game.

12:53.560 --> 12:55.800
Talk about a step up there.

12:55.800 --> 12:57.640
That's pretty cool.

12:57.640 --> 12:58.960
Ridge Racer had Galaga.

12:58.960 --> 12:59.960
Huh.

12:59.960 --> 13:03.680
But a lot of the Namco games had loading games.

13:03.680 --> 13:04.680
Interesting.

13:04.680 --> 13:07.200
Now have you gotten a chance to play match of Tekken 5 at all yet?

13:07.200 --> 13:09.960
I unwrapped it before we walked out of the door, literally.

13:09.960 --> 13:10.960
Gotcha.

13:10.960 --> 13:11.960
So you haven't really had a chance to tell.

13:11.960 --> 13:12.960
But you played the arcade version.

13:12.960 --> 13:13.960
Yeah.

13:13.960 --> 13:14.960
I played it in Alabama.

13:14.960 --> 13:20.960
Cause it, you know, I went right to, the only arcades in my hometown are Namco arcades.

13:20.960 --> 13:24.960
Unless you count, um, Ground Zero and that's just privately owned.

13:24.960 --> 13:31.960
But, um, first thing I did was make a beeline to Tekken 5 cause Tekken 5 had just recently come out in California

13:31.960 --> 13:34.960
but it had been out, um, at all the Namco arcades ages ago.

13:34.960 --> 13:38.960
So no one was there, I got to play it as much as I wanted to.

13:38.960 --> 13:40.960
Very cool.

13:40.960 --> 13:47.960
Um, okay, so, I'm looking forward to playing this game. I'll give you a full review on Tekken 5 as soon as I can.

13:47.960 --> 13:48.460
Next week.

13:48.460 --> 13:52.960
Next week! Yes, Loki and I will both- we will duel to the death on Tekken 5.

13:52.960 --> 13:54.460
I suck at Tekken, so that'll be great.

13:54.460 --> 13:55.960
I'll get to own you both.

13:55.960 --> 13:59.460
I'm not that great at Tekken. Jaime will kick both our asses, honestly.

13:59.460 --> 14:02.960
I like Hoa Rong, because he has this really cheap move I always do with him.

14:02.960 --> 14:03.960
Is he in Tekken 5?

14:03.960 --> 14:04.460
Yes.

14:04.460 --> 14:05.960
Oh, he better be. Good! Yay! I'm saved.

14:05.960 --> 14:07.960
And of course, my man Jean is in there.

14:07.960 --> 14:12.440
You can tell I'm such a Tekken 5 noob and I have not touched the arcade version yet,

14:12.440 --> 14:15.200
but seriously, every time I want to go play in the arcade, huge line, huge!

14:15.200 --> 14:19.560
I have my card, I haven't been able to use it since I came back in the state.

14:19.560 --> 14:23.800
Now that, now, it kind of doesn't seem like there was much time between the arcade release

14:23.800 --> 14:26.480
and the home release, but I guess what you're saying about the Namco.

14:26.480 --> 14:30.640
I remember the little movie at E3 and then, bam, arcade, whoa.

14:30.640 --> 14:33.320
Bam, arcade, and then bam, home version, it's like, yeesh.

14:33.320 --> 14:38.840
Alright, let's go ahead and move on to

14:38.840 --> 14:42.120
one other quick story. Very interesting announcement. We've had

14:42.120 --> 14:45.700
something Nintendo and something Sony with tech and now let's get to something

14:45.700 --> 14:50.000
Xbox. Microsoft. Hironobu Sakaguchi

14:50.000 --> 14:54.440
has joined up with Microsoft to develop role-playing game video games

14:54.440 --> 14:56.120
exclusively for

14:56.120 --> 15:00.440
the upcoming next-gen Xbox system. Why is this such a big deal?

15:00.440 --> 15:07.320
Well, if you didn't recognize the name, Sakaguchi is the creator of the Final Fantasy franchise.

15:07.320 --> 15:08.320
Very interesting.

15:08.320 --> 15:09.320
Good for them.

15:09.320 --> 15:13.800
I'd like to see them expand on games like Fable.

15:13.800 --> 15:19.520
The Xbox needs some, like, different variety kinds of games, I think.

15:19.520 --> 15:23.640
I think Fable was a good place for the Xbox to go, despite how you might feel about that

15:23.640 --> 15:24.640
game.

15:24.640 --> 15:26.920
It was kind of like, what is the Xbox really freaking lacking?

15:26.920 --> 15:28.200
Oh, a good RPG.

15:28.200 --> 15:32.580
well finally you get fable way later so I think this is a good direction for

15:32.580 --> 15:36.720
Microsoft to be looking into so just my thought I don't know any other thoughts

15:36.720 --> 15:41.420
from you guys I could definitely hopefully they're gonna be making some

15:41.420 --> 15:45.940
good games maybe an online game I would hope for an online game I don't know

15:45.940 --> 15:50.400
about MMO because I'm kind of headed up to here with MMOs but I don't know I

15:50.400 --> 15:55.820
guess that's where the money's at right I'll wait and see wait and see all right

15:55.820 --> 15:59.660
Alright, now of course we here at Orange Lounge Radio, we're not just here to fill you in

15:59.660 --> 16:04.820
on all the video game news that doesn't suck, but we're here to better your lives as well.

16:04.820 --> 16:09.140
But what better way to do that than allow Jamie to give you her advice column.

16:09.140 --> 16:15.020
So Dark Sakura, turn that anger that you usually have on our three hour program at OrangeLoungeRadio.com

16:15.020 --> 16:18.540
and turn it into a little bit of love for our listeners.

16:18.540 --> 16:26.500
I swear you people I give you good advice you never follow it so here's

16:26.500 --> 16:31.300
some advice did someone fail a lie detector test last week I guess so all

16:31.300 --> 16:37.340
right we have a bunch of liars yes and his name is mr. Jackson today's advice

16:37.340 --> 16:42.180
is how to get to the surface if your scuba tank runs out of air number one

16:42.180 --> 16:45.580
signal to your fellow divers that you are having a problem point to your tank

16:45.580 --> 16:56.020
or regulator. 2. If someone comes to your age, share his or her regulator, passing it

16:56.020 --> 17:00.700
back and forth while swimming slowly to the surface. 3. If no one can help you, keep your

17:00.700 --> 17:05.140
regulator in your mouth as air may expand in the tank as you ascend. Look straight up

17:05.140 --> 17:13.660
so that your airway is as straight as possible. 4. Swim to the surface at a moderate rate.

17:13.660 --> 17:17.660
Exhale continuously as you swim up but do not exhaust all of your air in the first few

17:17.660 --> 17:19.360
seconds of your ascent.

17:19.360 --> 17:25.180
If you do not exhale continuously, you risk an aneurysm.

17:25.180 --> 17:33.780
And another bit of the thing to add to that, just don't go scuba diving.

17:33.780 --> 17:40.220
If people were meant to swim that deep, they'd have gills, like in Waterworld.

17:40.220 --> 17:44.780
if you go scuba diving go down like maybe 20 feet at the most you snorkel

17:44.780 --> 17:50.140
did you actually see the water world movie okay I know they had gills I know

17:50.140 --> 17:55.220
it sucked well I don't Costner of course I know I just made a comment about not

17:55.220 --> 17:59.100
wanting to talk about MMOs but I had to mention this one

17:59.100 --> 18:05.740
anarchy anarchy anarchy online players will soon be seeing advertisements on

18:05.740 --> 18:10.660
on billboards that are stationed in central regions of the game's landscape

18:10.660 --> 18:14.340
uh... they're teaming up with the new york city based massive

18:14.340 --> 18:17.840
uh... the folks that create anarchy online and uh... they're going to be

18:17.840 --> 18:20.100
putting ads inside the game

18:20.100 --> 18:23.060
what do you think about ads in m m o s

18:23.060 --> 18:25.500
i hear though the game's gonna go free

18:25.500 --> 18:29.100
i think i guess now that would make sense why there's ads in it i suppose but

18:29.100 --> 18:30.680
seriously funding

18:30.680 --> 18:34.280
after the news that we got about the slash pizza in a request to last week

18:34.280 --> 18:35.460
with the pizza hut

18:35.460 --> 18:38.960
I mean, this is a totally obvious-

18:38.960 --> 18:42.960
To be honest, I mean, in a game like that, I don't really- I haven't ever played Anarchy

18:42.960 --> 18:47.720
Online, but if it's on billboards or something, I really don't see that deterring away from

18:47.720 --> 18:49.420
the game really that much.

18:49.420 --> 18:50.420
I mean...

18:50.420 --> 18:53.400
If it were in Final Fantasy XI, though, that would totally detract.

18:53.400 --> 18:54.400
Yeah, that would make no sense.

18:54.400 --> 18:58.360
Oh, I can't wait for the day- I can't wait for the day when I go into one of my Burning

18:58.360 --> 19:05.440
Circle Notorious Monster battles and it's like, Pepsi presents the Burning Circle Battle!

19:05.440 --> 19:08.620
Britney Spears coming out singing a song, and then you get to attack the monster, who

19:08.620 --> 19:09.620
is Britney Spears actually?

19:09.620 --> 19:13.220
You know, like, I can understand something like that, say, in Matrix online, where you're

19:13.220 --> 19:15.100
going to have billboards and ads.

19:15.100 --> 19:16.100
Right.

19:16.100 --> 19:18.320
In that type of environment, something like that would make sense.

19:18.320 --> 19:20.740
That would actually be a good way to-

19:20.740 --> 19:23.100
Powerade.

19:23.100 --> 19:25.180
Just like in the game, you know?

19:25.180 --> 19:30.220
But that would actually be a good way to get a little bit of extra money in there.

19:30.220 --> 19:35.180
But like, in something that's, you know, like, I wouldn't see it in Ragnarok online.

19:35.180 --> 19:39.380
No, to be honest if they're gonna put ads in a game and then they're gonna like say

19:39.380 --> 19:43.140
I don't know make it free or reduce the fees. It's gonna cost her a month

19:43.140 --> 19:46.300
Of course, you're gonna get people everybody. I'm fucked that I don't care, you know

19:46.300 --> 19:51.860
Hey, as long as I mean really long as it's not pop-ups cuz I fucking hate pop-ups

19:51.860 --> 19:53.860
Well, that's gonna turn from the game

19:53.900 --> 19:56.540
It's all about you know gameplay and these good things

19:56.540 --> 20:01.220
You know, otherwise you're gonna get people not gonna you know, shell out the 20 bucks or whatever

20:01.220 --> 20:03.220
It is a month to play these things. So

20:03.220 --> 20:14.220
So, you know, why not? I don't see a problem with it, and Anarchy Online seems like to me it's a pretty dynamic game as it is, pretty futuristic and stuff.

20:14.220 --> 20:22.220
So I guess it could fit in a few billboards, who cares? Whether it be some generic thing that doesn't exist or an actual product, who cares?

20:22.220 --> 20:30.220
I mean, it doesn't detract from the game that much, and even if they have like, you know, what is it, maybe even vending machines or something that we're like strewn about,

20:30.220 --> 20:34.180
You know or other crap, you know product placement and stuff. It really doesn't matter

20:34.180 --> 20:37.360
How about like in Duke Nukem 3d where I could blow those vending machines up?

20:37.900 --> 20:43.020
That would be awesome actually, but I'm just saying it's I don't like this ad. It's not a big deal

20:43.020 --> 20:45.700
I think would know these ads being in there

20:45.700 --> 20:48.580
It's when they go a little bit beyond that when you know

20:48.580 --> 20:53.480
Your loading screens have you know ads in it and like all that stuff that might get annoying

20:53.480 --> 20:57.980
But I think just screwing about making it actually fit the environment. I don't think that's a big deal

20:57.980 --> 21:04.540
Well, we shall see how far they take this idea, because anything they can advertise

21:04.540 --> 21:05.540
on they'll do it.

21:05.540 --> 21:10.460
I'm still waiting for my slash pizza and slash porn, but you know, no luck yet.

21:10.460 --> 21:15.380
Alright, back to Nintendo, they're going to be releasing a whole lot of titles in May,

21:15.380 --> 21:20.460
including Pokemon Emerald and Fire Emblem The Sacred Stones.

21:20.460 --> 21:25.500
Also coming out in May, Donkey Konga 2 and Geist.

21:25.500 --> 21:31.180
any of those games gonna be on the DS actually no they are all being released

21:31.180 --> 21:36.740
for the not not Pokemon it I'm sorry Pokemon emerald and fire emblem of

21:36.740 --> 21:40.920
course our Gameboy advanced titles Donkey Kong 2 and Geist GameCube titles

21:40.920 --> 21:49.060
no do you know DS titles Wow only one in February gee I don't think the PSP is

21:49.060 --> 21:53.360
gonna blow them out of the water when it gets released you mean the great game

21:53.360 --> 21:58.300
shooter yes the great game shooter Pokemon emerald of course being the

21:58.300 --> 22:01.880
next saga in the put it's it's another Pokemon game what else do I need to say

22:01.880 --> 22:06.800
it's another freaking Pokemon game you know I remember another console system

22:06.800 --> 22:10.340
a while back that actually had pretty good graphics but no games for it I

22:10.340 --> 22:15.080
don't know if anyone remembers the Atari links oh yes we've got links we have a

22:15.080 --> 22:18.300
bunch of games for you you have everything just because you own it

22:18.300 --> 22:21.660
doesn't mean it was successful you have everything it was awesome and it had

22:21.660 --> 22:26.900
Great commercial where the kids not got a class to sit in the bathroom to play it and the links had tempest 2000 which was

22:26.900 --> 22:31.900
My point beam though. Is that if they oh, no, never mind. I'm getting the links Jaguar. Hello

22:31.900 --> 22:37.640
I'm getting the links mixed up with the Jaguar. That's my see that's how much I played these systems. What?

22:39.260 --> 22:41.420
If I had a ruler and was a nun

22:43.420 --> 22:49.020
Whatever the point being is is the fact that they have the lack of games is gonna kill that system

22:49.020 --> 22:54.480
And sadly enough if they really need to get on the ball here with you know getting even like third parties

22:54.480 --> 23:01.580
But it can play the advanced games the pac-man marble goodie guess what the gameboy advance can play the gameboy games

23:01.740 --> 23:03.740
But you know what that doesn't matter

23:05.080 --> 23:07.080
We need marble madness

23:07.900 --> 23:09.900
damn, sir crystal castles

23:10.460 --> 23:15.700
Using the stylus as a trackball that would be a good idea for like Atari or somebody to put out

23:15.700 --> 23:18.020
I believe they're doing it good smart people

23:19.340 --> 23:21.540
Fire Emblem of course is the long-running

23:22.100 --> 23:27.520
Strategy RPG series and it'll have new characters yada yada Donkey Kong is the game with a bongos

23:27.520 --> 23:34.020
You know music game lots of fun Geist you will be in the role of a ghost who possesses people

23:34.860 --> 23:40.060
So it's a game about possessing people that sounds kind of cool. No that sounds pretty cool, but it's already been done

23:40.060 --> 23:46.120
I'm wondering why they're just now jumping on fire. Oh, wait a second. There's been like seven other versions out in Japan

23:46.640 --> 23:48.700
Cuz it's just now starting to take off here

23:48.700 --> 23:55.320
I was a game out there that I saw at e3 where he possessed stuff including like a dog food bowl now

23:55.320 --> 24:02.800
That might have been guys though. Yeah, that probably was guys. Never mind. I sound like an idiot. It's all right. Nothing. Nothing abnormal

24:05.320 --> 24:06.620
Lastly

24:06.620 --> 24:14.580
Little piece of news here the fable soundtrack is coming out or it just came out recently and it has the fable theme

24:14.580 --> 24:17.740
Which was created by Danny Elfman, of course, you know, we can go boy go

24:18.420 --> 24:21.780
And it's being released by something else

24:22.420 --> 24:28.780
Sum something else studios and it has a lot of the score as well by Russell Shaw, which kind of makes me think

24:29.620 --> 24:35.000
Why the hell don't more video games get soundtrack releases seriously do in Japan just about every game that comes out

24:35.000 --> 24:38.600
Well, sure, in Japan, but I'm talking about America, so I don't have to pay-

24:38.600 --> 24:40.400
What's happening more often?

24:40.400 --> 24:45.320
But for games like Fable, what about games like DDR getting full soundtracks?

24:45.320 --> 24:49.480
I guess they have the VRares, I guess, but there's other games with great soundtracks

24:49.480 --> 24:50.480
as well.

24:50.480 --> 24:51.920
Katamari Damacy, hello.

24:51.920 --> 24:54.200
Yeah, that had great music.

24:54.200 --> 24:56.200
Where's the domestic soundtrack release?

24:56.200 --> 24:58.640
Although, um, I know that, um...

24:58.640 --> 25:03.240
Of course, the soundtrack will probably cost as much as the game, but hey.

25:03.240 --> 25:05.160
Well

25:05.160 --> 25:07.160
there are games that

25:07.360 --> 25:10.520
they put soundtracks out for like I

25:11.720 --> 25:16.200
Have to think about it actually or dad. You know what they could do they did well for all of the

25:18.080 --> 25:23.320
Grand Theft Auto games yeah, you know they could do though. Why don't they just near release Katamari Damacy

25:23.960 --> 25:29.240
Special Edition including the soundtrack in a poster sell it for 30 bucks there you go

25:29.240 --> 25:31.640
Guess what you made your money, and you sold the game again. That's so

25:31.640 --> 25:33.960
Like in Korea and include a umbrella.

25:33.960 --> 25:37.640
Because guess, because you know what people out there are buying special editions.

25:37.640 --> 25:40.480
That's a brand new thing now that they're doing with all these games that are coming out.

25:40.480 --> 25:42.360
Tekken 5 special edition, 100 bucks.

25:42.360 --> 25:47.880
Exactly, and it's just, that's the thing, that's, you know, if you want your soundtrack, put it in the special edition.

25:47.880 --> 25:49.400
That's the way to do it.

25:51.080 --> 25:53.880
Alright, that's gonna wrap it up for tonight's podcast.

25:53.880 --> 25:58.480
Thank you guys very much for downloading us and staying loyal to our show. We appreciate it.

25:58.480 --> 26:00.480
Jamie, any parting words for our listeners tonight?

26:01.480 --> 26:02.480
L.

26:02.980 --> 26:03.980
Loki.

26:03.980 --> 26:10.980
Ultracade trying to copyright MAME is bad.

26:10.980 --> 26:14.980
Do not play Ultracade and fight this to the death.

26:14.980 --> 26:19.980
Not only is it bad, but it's stupid and they have no legal grounds.

26:19.980 --> 26:24.980
It's so bad it should have its own word. It's like bad wrong or badong.

26:24.980 --> 26:29.820
Sorry, that's a Kung Pao reference there.

26:29.820 --> 26:34.660
And my final thought I guess would be, thou shalt kick an Ultracade machine when you see

26:34.660 --> 26:36.380
it.

26:36.380 --> 26:51.620
Have a great one everybody, we'll see you next time.
