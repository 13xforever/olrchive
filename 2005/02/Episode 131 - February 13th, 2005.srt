57
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:28,600
Would you tell me now?

58
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:03,600
I need someone to stay in the car

00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:06,600

00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,600
You

63
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:42,800
Love, I just gotta have it, I believe in love, so let it go

64
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:46,800
Surprised it finally happened to me

65
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:54,800
Now I've realized this was a love from me

66
00:09:56,800 --> 00:10:00,800
Cause when we dance together

67
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:04,800
You're like a dream come true

68
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:07,800
I feel so beautiful

69
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:12,800
What's inside is all those of you

70
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:18,800
Love, I just gotta have it I believe in love

71
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:24,800
I can't be without it Come to me and make your confession

72
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:30,800
Love, come let it go Love, I just gotta have it

73
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:36,800
I believe in love I can't be without it

74
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:40,240
Come to me and make your confession

75
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:44,240
Love, who let it go?

76
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:25,240
Sometimes I am thinking of being too blind

77
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:33,240
Sometimes I'm too close to what I have to be

78
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:38,240
So I feel a friction line

79
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:41,240
So I do it myself

80
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:46,240
And I can't wait for my memories

81
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:48,240
To come to my life

82
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:53,240
I call you, I need you

83
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:57,240
I want to be your love

84
00:11:57,240 --> 00:12:00,240
I gave you my touch

85
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:04,240
I gave you all my life

86
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:08,240
I lie here, I call you

87
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:12,240
I live for you all my life

88
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:20,240
I always need to be with you

89
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:25,240

Hello boys and girls and welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio episode number 131.

114
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:33,260
In progress, we're here on this Valentine's Day eve.

115
00:14:33,260 --> 00:14:38,680
Happy Valentine's Day to all you lovebirds out there, all you happy, sweet little couples.

116
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:41,920
And to the rest of you, happy Bitter Singles Awareness Day.

117
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:47,040
Yes, you're in the same boat that I am, so the next break of songs will be for you.

118
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:51,040
I'm going to pick some good bitter, bitter angry songs for the next break.

119
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:55,920
I don't know if there's really a whole lot of breakup songs that are in DDR or Bomani

120
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:57,600
in general.

121
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:01,920
The chat room is helping me come up with a few good ideas, but I think it's just going

122
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:05,680
to be a lot of angry songs next break, a lot of anger, because that's what Valentine's

123
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:07,440
Day makes me feel, is a lot of anger.

124
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:11,360
I'm allowed to be bitter once in a while.

125
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:13,320
Anyway, you are listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

126
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:16,620
Jamie, aka DarkSakura, is not here tonight.

127
00:15:16,620 --> 00:15:23,920
She is spending Valentine's Day Eve with her man, because she's engaged and has her hetero

128
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:25,280
life partner or whatever.

129
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:29,560
I can't remember how she refers to them, but you know they're out and doing their thing

130
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:36,560
I guess because tomorrow being a workday. It's a little harder to do stuff, so they're doing they're doing their lovey-dovey stuff tonight

131
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:39,360
so I

132
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:42,520
Suppose we can forgive it as long as it's only once a year

133
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:47,020
The minute they try to bring Valentine's Day in like another holiday forget it. It's done with

134
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:52,760
Wait a minute

135
00:15:52,760 --> 00:16:02,440
I thought Valentine's Day was a pain in the ass for you.

136
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:07,240
I said I'll allow it, as Judge Mills Lane would say.

137
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:12,840
Alright, we'll start off the show as we usually do, playing a little bit of How Was Your Week,

138
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:16,760
How Was Your Day, and I guess we all know that Dark Sakura is the one that usually starts

139
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:19,960
us off and we all know that she's doing great tonight, I'm sure.

140
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:23,840
So, uh, you know. Well, I guess we'll go to DDR Angel. DDR Angel, how was your week, how

141
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:24,840
was your day?

142
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:32,400
Um, actually it was kind of depressing for once. Me? Depressed? Yeah, right. Okay. First

143
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:37,640
of all, like, Tuesday when I went to school everything was fine until, like, just before

144
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:45,000
my second class when I realized my Linux book was missing. And so I was, like, in a slight

145
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:49,720
panic, emailed the teacher, all that stuff, wondering where the hell it went. And also,

146
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:55,040
So in the next 48 hours, I was preparing myself to actually have to go out and buy the book

147
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:56,380
again.

148
00:16:56,380 --> 00:17:02,800
But I went to class Thursday, and it turns out that the student that sits next to me,

149
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:09,280
I decided to grab it on accident, so she ran up to me on Thursday and gave it back, and

150
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:17,320
was really apologetic and stuff, so it was just a turnaround from a bad situation to

151
00:17:17,320 --> 00:17:18,320
a good one again.

152
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:24,560
that turned out really well and the next depressing thing that happened to me is

153
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:31,880
unfortunately permanent so that kind of sucks the radio station I was DJing for

154
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:38,280
kthr also known as pulse before it was kthr they ended up shutting down this

155
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:43,960
week so after three years of my life I'm no longer teaching for a station that I

156
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:48,200
actually like DJing for so that kind of sucks you know what and and all that

157
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:51,440
news about what they're doing just you know I think it's time for us to quit

158
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:56,280
too well it was sad for me because honestly if it wasn't for orange lounge

159
00:17:56,280 --> 00:18:01,400
I wouldn't have you know found them or anything like that so and that was you

160
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:08,560
know three or what two and a half years ago something like that when I when your

161
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:14,240
buddy you went to your buddy's show and boom next thing you know I'm DJing for

162
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:19,340
so yeah oh that's that's right you didn't find out about them until I went

163
00:18:19,340 --> 00:18:24,060
and did the guest thing on their network okay and you know that DJ she's back in

164
00:18:24,060 --> 00:18:29,940
town this weekend so it's kind of neat I know I haven't seen her no she's she's

165
00:18:29,940 --> 00:18:34,260
out she's either working or she's partying there's not a whole lot to do

166
00:18:34,260 --> 00:18:42,320
in town oh yeah so you know I either have a choice of going to a newer radio

167
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:48,160
station or just kind of hanging low and whatever and you know if it wasn't I

168
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:52,640
realized that Orange Losers was obviously my first radio station I was associated

169
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:56,840
with so you guys are always going to be first but as far as you know side work

170
00:18:56,840 --> 00:19:02,280
was concerned the other radio station was just what I did and for half the

171
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:07,040
week I was just really down and I still am a little bit but I'm getting over it

172
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:10,800
a little bit you know right slowly well you know and as I said because you

173
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:15,760
you'd mentioned this in LJ, LiveJournal, for those who don't know, LJ is a place where

174
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:20,680
we can all get a little emo when we need to be, and you made a little bit of an emo post

175
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:21,680
earlier this week.

176
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:22,680
I did.

177
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:25,560
Because you were sad, you were like, I'm so depressed.

178
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:27,280
I really was though.

179
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:31,960
But I mean, as I mentioned in LiveJournal, I'll tell you again, for the benefit of our

180
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:35,240
listeners, when a radio station like that closes down, you just have to remember the

181
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:38,920
good memories you have of the people you met there, and you'll know those people for some

182
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:43,060
time and some of them will go off and do other projects and you know maybe can

183
00:19:43,060 --> 00:19:46,020
help them out with that but you know you'll remember the radio station for a

184
00:19:46,020 --> 00:19:48,880
long time you know it's inevitable orange launch radio will not last

185
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:56,980
forever you know the three of us have to die someday so I don't plan on dying

186
00:19:56,980 --> 00:20:02,500
ever so I can't help it oh you oh you clicked on oh you know the secret to

187
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:07,360
immortality then from that banner on the internet the secret of forget it yeah go

188
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:15,360
So, Fig, the one- yeah, they sent out one spam mail scene who had actually, you know, hit on that, and, um, actually one of them was real.

189
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:23,360
Oh, I see, okay. And you know what? Not only will I live forever, but my penis is larger than ever.

190
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:30,360
And you're getting V1 Agra? Really cheap?

191
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:31,360
Exactly.

192
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:32,360
V1 Agra?

193
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:34,360
And my breasts, they're firm and large.

194
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:42,560
Anyway, it's inevitable that Orange Lounge Radio is going to die someday, so I hope you

195
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:45,360
all don't get too teary-eyed when it happens.

196
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:48,040
Someday, but I hope not soon, just because...

197
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:49,040
It's not going to happen soon.

198
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:50,720
I don't think so, but...

199
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:56,800
Unless we get the offer to, you know, take this to like, a real thing, like satellite

200
00:20:56,800 --> 00:21:02,720
radio, or go to some television outlet.

201
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:10,240
So as I said, I've said this time and time again, I would sell out in 0.5 seconds to

202
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:12,320
the highest bidder.

203
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:13,320
My soul is up for...

204
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:15,320
I'm putting my soul up on eBay.

205
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:20,320
Anyway, I'd be like, you're going to pay me to do this?

206
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:21,320
Okay.

207
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:23,920
You want to pay me for doing Wayne's World?

208
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:24,920
Sure.

209
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:28,880
How did I know you were going to go there?

210
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:30,680
That movie is like my anthem.

211
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:31,680
It's like...

212
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:32,680
Anyway, sorry.

213
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:41,720
up now angel um geez what else did i get into this week uh some online game that i can't talk about

214
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:50,040
loki knows what i'm talking about anyway um yeah so that that was pretty fun um god i haven't even

215
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:55,480
been able to play but i think c11 this week just because all the crap that's been going on geez

216
00:21:55,480 --> 00:22:01,480
Um, I guess that's it. I mean, I can't really remember much else.

217
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:02,480
Great.

218
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:03,480
Two big things. What?

219
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:06,480
I just had to point out, they're making bids in the chatroom right now.

220
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:10,480
Ah, no comment.

221
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:12,480
I need to learn to keep my mouth shut on this show.

222
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:15,480
I know it wouldn't make for interesting radio if I didn't say anything,

223
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:18,480
but every time I open my mouth, I get myself in trouble with the chatroom.

224
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:21,480
All I got to do is pay more than making out my job, which isn't that much.

225
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:24,120
Which isn't much! Some of these bids they're makin'!

226
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:26,640
Some of these bids they're makin'!

227
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:32,840
So far, all but like one.

228
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:34,440
Anyway, sorry Angel, we keep cutting you off.

229
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:37,480
No, it's okay. I would go for the

230
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:40,840
cute frilly thing that happened this week, but it's not, you know, you guys won't

231
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:42,200
care, so...

232
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:43,580
Well, tell it anyway.

233
00:22:43,580 --> 00:22:46,080
At least we can make fun of it.

234
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:48,120
Yeah, okay, you can make fun of it no problem.

235
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:52,600
That other game I usually play during the week, uh, There, um...

236
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:55,760
Now for those who don't know what There is, explain this a little bit. What is There?

237
00:22:55,760 --> 00:23:00,640
It's like Sims, but better. But over there? Yeah, shut up.

238
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:05,520
Is it, it's kind of like Sims Online? Well, kind of, except you don't have, like, the, um...

239
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:08,760
There's no prostitutes and gamblers and all that stuff that basically...

240
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:11,880
Because you heard this is what happened to Sims Online. Sims Online was supposed to be

241
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:13,040
this, you know,

242
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:17,520
great new online experience game and it quickly turned into every Vegas street

243
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:23,760
corner. That's fucking awesome. I would play Sims Online if it didn't cost money, just

244
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:29,120
for that. Well, there's actually kind of worse, because you end up using your own money to

245
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:34,480
get, you know, game money and all that stuff, so you kind of have to watch yourself, otherwise

246
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:39,000
you'll go broke. That's the other interesting thing about there. They have made buying the

247
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:45,240
in-game currency with real money, like, not a problem. Seriously, because you'll... That's

248
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:59,240
Whereas every other online role-playing game, you know Final Fantasy, EverQuest, World of Warcraft, you know they frown on people selling the gold or the gil or the whatevers outside of the game for real money.

249
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:01,240
But there...

250
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:09,240
I didn't learn Jack's ship from Barman. All I learned is that I might die if I'm not paying attention.

251
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:16,600
yeah so I mean there's kind of different like that uh I ended up getting their

252
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:24,120
married quote-unquote oh shut up it was cute whatever so you had an online

253
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:33,520
wedding yeah only only in America I wanna I wanna their honeymoon yeah what

254
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:37,680
did you do for the their honeymoon um nothing yet he said he's gonna do it

255
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:40,280
Yeah, he said I probably would do it tonight or whatever, I don't know.

256
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:41,780
You're gonna do it tonight, huh?

257
00:24:41,780 --> 00:24:43,780
Shut the hell up!

258
00:24:43,780 --> 00:24:46,780
Hey, it was kinda cool that he shot me off the cliff.

259
00:24:46,780 --> 00:24:49,780
Yeah, shut up. I knew that was gonna go there.

260
00:24:49,780 --> 00:24:52,280
Can you buy some their condoms with real life money?

261
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:56,280
Ugh! See, now I got them started. What the hell was I thinking?

262
00:24:56,280 --> 00:24:58,280
You better get their morning after pill.

263
00:24:58,280 --> 00:25:01,280
Otherwise you're gonna have their illegitimate child.

264
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:03,280
Okay, this is just as bad as a piss joke.

265
00:25:03,280 --> 00:25:05,280
Who their baby daddy?

266
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:10,360
Hey now. Sorry. Anyway, he shot me off a cliff. That was kind of funny.

267
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:15,680
Wait, what? We jumped into a buggy quote-unquote their car and

268
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:19,720
he hit the boost and I jumped off, we flew off the cliff. That was kind of funny.

269
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:24,160
So, you got married and then jumped off a cliff? Yeah. Never mind.

270
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:27,960
You know, I do watch a story last night about this guy that was trying to get people to

271
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:34,320
get, you know, to commit suicide on Valentine's Day. See, all it takes is one bitter person and, you know.

272
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:40,440
they're all dead

273
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:44,080
wow if only you guys... they're dead

274
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:47,800
if only you guys knew about that game you probably wouldn't be picking on me so much

275
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:48,800
but hey it's always fun

276
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:52,720
I know it sounds like fun it's just I I only have enough time for one game you

277
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:54,640
know this I can't

278
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:58,080
I know and I don't know how you do it I can't play more in one game

279
00:25:58,080 --> 00:26:01,700
come Tuesday I'm gonna have to go back to Final Fantasy 11 just because

280
00:26:01,700 --> 00:26:06,060
there is going to be down for like 28 hours or something because they're like relocating

281
00:26:06,060 --> 00:26:07,680
their servers and all that crap so...

282
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:09,460
They're relocating their servers.

283
00:26:09,460 --> 00:26:10,460
Sorry.

284
00:26:10,460 --> 00:26:16,780
I opened a can of worms!

285
00:26:16,780 --> 00:26:22,220
Oh uh, comment from the chat room, Firebama, I don't know if it's Boma or Bama, I'm gonna

286
00:26:22,220 --> 00:26:24,660
say Bama, I like that it sounds like fire the bomb.

287
00:26:24,660 --> 00:26:29,100
Firebama says their STDs suck, so be careful.

288
00:26:29,100 --> 00:26:30,660
Don't get their herpes.

289
00:26:30,660 --> 00:26:33,660
Yeah. No.

290
00:26:33,660 --> 00:26:37,660
That would suck if you could catch diseases from online games.

291
00:26:37,660 --> 00:26:39,660
Oh jeez.

292
00:26:39,660 --> 00:26:44,660
I think online games are kind of a disease in general. I mean, seriously.

293
00:26:44,660 --> 00:26:50,660
I bet if I went to a shrink and I told them how much I played Final Fantasy XI, she'd fucking slap me upside the head and say,

294
00:26:50,660 --> 00:26:51,660
Go outside!

295
00:26:51,660 --> 00:26:55,660
I'm gonna sue Final Fantasy XI and Square Enix for making me lazy.

296
00:26:55,660 --> 00:26:59,140
but they have their disclaimer at the start of the game that says you know

297
00:26:59,140 --> 00:27:03,980
don't don't forget your family and don't forget your family and friends and work

298
00:27:03,980 --> 00:27:07,100
no I didn't forget my family friends and work but I'm sitting on my ass

299
00:27:07,100 --> 00:27:10,900
playing the game. I acknowledge that they exist however

300
00:27:10,900 --> 00:27:15,420
I think about them all the time

301
00:27:15,420 --> 00:27:18,780
and I think about how much they don't love me

302
00:27:18,780 --> 00:27:21,860
which is why I'm playing this god damn game

303
00:27:21,860 --> 00:27:28,860
If I get killed by a goblin, one more- okay I'll shut up.

304
00:27:28,940 --> 00:27:30,220
Next!

305
00:27:30,220 --> 00:27:31,520
Because I'm done.

306
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:34,780
Loki, how was your week, how was your day?

307
00:27:34,780 --> 00:27:38,220
Well, um...

308
00:27:38,220 --> 00:27:40,960
I don't even really remember what happened this week.

309
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:43,340
Not much of anything I'd imagine.

310
00:27:43,340 --> 00:27:46,540
Um...

311
00:27:46,540 --> 00:27:47,700
Well, today

312
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:52,780
I spent, uh, most of the day playing Final Fantasy, drinking milk, and eating bacon bits.

313
00:27:52,780 --> 00:27:56,460
And, um...

314
00:27:56,460 --> 00:27:58,540
Then what else did I do?

315
00:27:58,540 --> 00:28:02,380
Oh yeah, I started charging my battery, but I found nothing.

316
00:28:02,380 --> 00:28:04,100
Wait, bacon bits? You just...

317
00:28:04,100 --> 00:28:05,660
eat them right out of the...

318
00:28:05,660 --> 00:28:08,100
right out of the can, right?

319
00:28:08,100 --> 00:28:11,740
You just eat the bacon bits right out of the jar? Yep, ate about half the container.

320
00:28:11,740 --> 00:28:15,220
Can I put the jar on the webcam? Well, I don't know if the cam's actually up and

321
00:28:15,220 --> 00:28:17,940
running just yet. I'll check on that first. Well, it's up and running, but it might not

322
00:28:17,940 --> 00:28:20,700
be up and running on the website. I have to make sure everything is running on the web

323
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:24,060
end. No, it's not. I will set it up, I'll set the webcam up, and I will go show the

324
00:28:24,060 --> 00:28:28,820
jar of bacon bits while you talk about your week here. So anyways, yeah, I was eating

325
00:28:28,820 --> 00:28:33,700
those. I don't know why, because I have, like, this really crappy soup for lunch, and it

326
00:28:33,700 --> 00:28:39,220
just wasn't, you know, hitting the spot. So bacon bits, it was, and I don't know, it worked.

327
00:28:39,220 --> 00:28:45,960
So whatever, so then also what else happened this week, oh my coworker quit finally, and

328
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:54,400
my other coworker put in his notice, so I'll be all alone, and what else did I do, oh some

329
00:28:54,400 --> 00:29:00,300
other crap I worked on, the thing that pissed me off was my battery that cost me $200 is

330
00:29:00,300 --> 00:29:12,100
fucked up and so now I gotta return it so you know hey the hell oh yeah so then

331
00:29:12,100 --> 00:29:15,660
as I'm playing Final Fantasy and party and eating bacon bits I spill that crap

332
00:29:15,660 --> 00:29:21,700
all over the place so you know probably just some stuck in my for the record

333
00:29:21,700 --> 00:29:30,140
these are imitation bacon buds whatever it's the cheap shit okay don't

334
00:29:30,140 --> 00:29:37,140
be hating. Nellie likes them too. So anyways. And see you ate him! You ate him too!

335
00:29:38,300 --> 00:29:44,340
And I'm grimacing. These are gross. How could you? Ugh! Oh god!

336
00:29:44,340 --> 00:29:47,760
Acquire a taste, Robin. Acquire a taste. And again, I'm also the same person who takes

337
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:53,740
shots of, you know, Maple Serpent eats rice. Raw. Without being cooked.

338
00:29:53,740 --> 00:29:57,500
Oh, you also eat the top ramen just right out of the bag uncooked too.

339
00:29:57,500 --> 00:29:58,800
That I can do, unfortunately.

340
00:29:58,800 --> 00:30:01,100
Oh, God! Oh, yeah, like, what is wrong with you people?

341
00:30:01,100 --> 00:30:05,100
What? I can do it, but, you know, I haven't...

342
00:30:05,100 --> 00:30:07,500
I haven't eaten it in a...

343
00:30:07,500 --> 00:30:09,700
Okay, that I won't do.

344
00:30:09,700 --> 00:30:12,300
Now my breath's gonna smell like pork.

345
00:30:12,300 --> 00:30:16,800
That bacon bit...flavor's never gonna leave your stomach.

346
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:18,400
That's one of the things about it.

347
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:22,200
Can't you just get some lettuce, and some ranch dressing,

348
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:24,900
and then have yourself a salad, and then put the bacon bits on the salad?

349
00:30:24,900 --> 00:30:28,820
Fucking hate salad dude salad is nasty. I'm sorry, man

350
00:30:28,820 --> 00:30:35,720
I cannot imagine eating like grass or you know shrubbery or something like that. That's just nast bunnies do it. Why can't you?

351
00:30:36,700 --> 00:30:39,380
Yeah, but bunnies poop like crazy. I

352
00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:42,620
Don't fucking take shits like that. I

353
00:30:46,260 --> 00:30:48,260
Give up

354
00:30:48,860 --> 00:30:50,420
Anyways

355
00:30:50,420 --> 00:30:57,100
So yeah, my week was filled with that and then I got to play I'm part of the matrix online stress test one

356
00:30:57,180 --> 00:31:01,180
Which I might say that I'm never gonna buy that fucking game because it's lame

357
00:31:02,780 --> 00:31:09,060
Awful, I mean granted don't you have some type of non-disclosure agreement? Oh, yeah, I will tell you why it sucks

358
00:31:09,060 --> 00:31:12,580
but I'm gonna tell you that sucks, you know, really it I

359
00:31:13,540 --> 00:31:15,380
I like the game

360
00:31:15,380 --> 00:31:19,980
it mean it's pretty in the idea like they have with you know the music where

361
00:31:19,980 --> 00:31:23,180
it's dynamic to what you're doing it changes and that kind of thing that's

362
00:31:23,180 --> 00:31:27,900
cool but I don't know what the fuck I'm doing at all I like got in there I'm

363
00:31:27,900 --> 00:31:35,060
like yeah and you just kind of run around the fighting systems awkward and

364
00:31:35,060 --> 00:31:43,140
just well now wait I I sign no agreement and I happen to see a friend playing

365
00:31:43,140 --> 00:31:48,420
playing this game, so I could express my comments, because I'm not holding no agreement.

366
00:31:48,420 --> 00:31:52,580
I don't care, they can fucking sue my ass, I don't really give a shit.

367
00:31:52,580 --> 00:31:57,700
They ain't gonna get anything, we already talked about how much you make.

368
00:31:57,700 --> 00:32:01,180
You certainly don't get paid for this show.

369
00:32:01,180 --> 00:32:02,180
Exactly.

370
00:32:02,180 --> 00:32:09,700
So, um, yeah, um, yeah, it's not that great.

371
00:32:09,700 --> 00:32:12,260
You know what though, actually in observing it though, I feel a little different.

372
00:32:12,260 --> 00:32:13,900
I actually kind of wanted to play it.

373
00:32:13,900 --> 00:32:16,460
I was kind of like, oh this looks interesting.

374
00:32:16,460 --> 00:32:18,340
Like if I had more of a tutorial.

375
00:32:18,340 --> 00:32:21,020
It looks better than I thought it was going to be.

376
00:32:21,020 --> 00:32:22,020
Yeah.

377
00:32:22,020 --> 00:32:23,020
I'll give you that.

378
00:32:23,020 --> 00:32:27,320
It looks better than I thought it was going to be, and it also, the graphics are pretty

379
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:28,380
good.

380
00:32:28,380 --> 00:32:33,440
The amount of like, ways you can customize your character is pretty cool.

381
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:38,180
But like, I did about six or seven of the missions, and I was bored out of my mind.

382
00:32:38,180 --> 00:32:39,380
I'd only gotten to level two.

383
00:32:39,380 --> 00:32:44,300
had no idea how to level up on anything. Did you get to do any bullet time? No. See, that's

384
00:32:44,300 --> 00:32:49,360
what everybody wants. They want bullet time. They want it now. But the thing is, it's like,

385
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:52,880
I, well, actually, no, I take that back. There was one move that I did, it's called Cheap

386
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:57,800
Shot. You kinda turn around and in bullet time you kick the guy in the nuts. Cheap Shot

387
00:32:57,800 --> 00:33:02,920
20. So that was kinda cool. Now you got me. But, um, you know, other than that, it's just

388
00:33:02,920 --> 00:33:06,440
like, I didn't really know how to, like, progress in the game, whereas Final Fantasy is pretty

389
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:12,280
simply you walk outside kill shit. Exactly. You murder bunnies. Like I couldn't tell exactly

390
00:33:12,280 --> 00:33:17,380
I couldn't tell what who was the NPCs who were not the NPCs who were the enemies who

391
00:33:17,380 --> 00:33:22,160
could I fight what the hell the story was it's just it was all confusing there's a tutorial

392
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:27,180
that I did and I had to quit the game so then I couldn't go back to the tutorial again and

393
00:33:27,180 --> 00:33:31,360
it's just like and then Morpheus drones on for about five minutes once you get the game

394
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:36,360
for the first time. I was just like, okay, I don't know what the hell's going on. It

395
00:33:36,360 --> 00:33:37,360
was confusing.

396
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:39,240
So it was kind of like the second Matrix movie?

397
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:47,280
It's probably better than the second Matrix movie. You know, but I don't know. I'll probably

398
00:33:47,280 --> 00:33:50,680
play it again. I don't really know when the stress test ends. I think it's either this

399
00:33:50,680 --> 00:33:53,080
week or two weeks from now. I'm not sure.

400
00:33:53,080 --> 00:33:56,280
You know, I was actually watching TV last night, and for some reason we have free HBO

401
00:33:56,280 --> 00:33:59,280
right now. I'm not going to complain, but we have free HBO, because I just by chance

402
00:33:59,280 --> 00:34:02,520
was channel starving and I ended up on HBO and they were showing the second

403
00:34:02,520 --> 00:34:06,440
matrix movie and so I started to watch it for like five minutes and I was like

404
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:15,720
I'm bored I'm going to bed yeah and I love it's just whatever try it if you

405
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:22,640
want but don't I'd recommend probably Final Fantasy it's just I don't know if

406
00:34:22,640 --> 00:34:26,600
that was my first online game or whatever to get into I'd probably be

407
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:31,280
confused it it probably turned me off to online games it's it's very good if

408
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:34,760
you're like a first-person shooter type person and you're getting into online

409
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:38,760
games that would be the way to go because the controls are that of a

410
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:42,120
first-person shooter and so you'd probably feel right at home with that

411
00:34:42,120 --> 00:34:47,880
it's like if you're a you know quake doom Halo nut maybe all right sounds

412
00:34:47,880 --> 00:34:54,920
good um I was gonna say forget oh oh yeah I know I was gonna say I still want

413
00:34:54,920 --> 00:35:00,020
give World of Warcraft a fair shot. I got to observe World of Warcraft a little bit

414
00:35:00,020 --> 00:35:08,280
and it seemed interesting, so, but I wasn't like, wowed. Pun intended. You know, I wasn't

415
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:11,560
like on the floor like, oh my gosh, I have to play this game, like a lot of people who

416
00:35:11,560 --> 00:35:14,300
have been playing it have said. But, Angel?

417
00:35:14,300 --> 00:35:19,480
Um, Magus actually picked it up, so I've been watching him play it.

418
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:20,480
Does it look good?

419
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:24,440
yeah it looks it looks good I mean it's it's Blizzard but it was kind of funny

420
00:35:24,440 --> 00:35:28,780
because he was like killing stuff and all of a sudden I hear Diablo 2 sounds

421
00:35:28,780 --> 00:35:34,020
I'm going huh I'm like oh wait Blizzard game so they just recycled the same

422
00:35:34,020 --> 00:35:39,380
effects well you know whatever yeah um the characters characters don't look as

423
00:35:39,380 --> 00:35:44,900
pretty as you know Final Fantasy 11 because it's different so about the only

424
00:35:44,900 --> 00:35:49,180
funny thing that I find actually amusing is like they can do like little dances

425
00:35:49,180 --> 00:35:56,520
and stuff no matter what, you know, depending on what race you choose, that was hilarious.

426
00:35:56,520 --> 00:36:04,360
Like the, what, the dark undead guy can like rock out and stuff, it's really funny.

427
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:07,100
You know what's interesting is the number one thing I hear about World of Warcraft is

428
00:36:07,100 --> 00:36:12,840
that they say it's more built for the casual player who wants to play by themself and doesn't

429
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:18,660
really want to party up a whole lot, and my first reaction is, well then why play a multiplayer

430
00:36:18,660 --> 00:36:24,220
a massive online game if you want to play by yourself! That's the part I don't get,

431
00:36:24,220 --> 00:36:29,020
but other than that... Because, here's why, because in like, when you get down to Final

432
00:36:29,020 --> 00:36:33,020
Fantasy or whatever, in the higher levels, if you don't find a party, you're stuck. You're

433
00:36:33,020 --> 00:36:39,580
just sitting there for hours doing nothing, and that's why. People will get turned off

434
00:36:39,580 --> 00:36:43,620
by that kind of crap. Because they don't, you know, obviously know they could be doing

435
00:36:43,620 --> 00:36:47,340
thousands of other things. You can find things to do, even when you're high level. But people

436
00:36:47,340 --> 00:36:50,620
want to be leveling up and they can't do that

437
00:36:50,620 --> 00:36:54,900
but you cuz you could do you know in fires let me you could do something you

438
00:36:54,900 --> 00:36:55,300
could do

439
00:36:55,300 --> 00:36:58,540
are you know but you know people don't want stuff that's very misleading in

440
00:36:58,540 --> 00:37:00,580
Final Fantasy 11 for example you know

441
00:37:00,580 --> 00:37:03,920
easy prey stuff when you're level right 10

442
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:07,900
is fucking easy when you get up to like level 30 whatever

443
00:37:07,900 --> 00:37:12,300
you can't kill an easy prey thing by yourself it's just that kind of

444
00:37:12,300 --> 00:37:16,100
I'm difficulty stuff they need to kinda fix that a bit

445
00:37:16,100 --> 00:37:20,500
because I want to be fighting something that's easy to pray and have it be easy to kill.

446
00:37:20,500 --> 00:37:25,100
Whereas I don't get shit for experience, but I want it to be fucking easy to kill.

447
00:37:25,100 --> 00:37:35,100
Alright. Let's move on, and Explicit joined us. He snuck in through the door while we were talking there a little bit ago.

448
00:37:35,100 --> 00:37:36,100
So how you doing, Explicit?

449
00:37:36,100 --> 00:37:40,100
Pretty okay for the whole week.

450
00:37:40,100 --> 00:37:42,100
Well, I was going to ask, how was your week, how was your day, sir?

451
00:37:42,100 --> 00:37:51,660
Well, this whole week's been hell, this whole, been pretty much hell, due to all of unnecessary

452
00:37:51,660 --> 00:37:58,380
drama that's been shoved in my face the whole week, especially like right after the tournament

453
00:37:58,380 --> 00:37:59,600
of course.

454
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:01,300
How did things go with the tournament, by the way?

455
00:38:01,300 --> 00:38:05,740
Okay, like during the tournament it went very well, because like, I mean, we had the speakers

456
00:38:05,740 --> 00:38:11,220
and had the microphone to talk to people and what they think about the tournament so far,

457
00:38:11,220 --> 00:38:15,180
know it seems pretty fair I mean a lot of people had fun and stuff but I heard

458
00:38:15,180 --> 00:38:21,320
a lot of the bad news of course we all know drama drama drama revolution where

459
00:38:21,320 --> 00:38:25,640
would we be without it yeah unfortunately we get a bit we get

460
00:38:25,640 --> 00:38:30,880
somebody who was bitching about bitching the whole time I'm like and trying to

461
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:35,400
get into the faces of the judge to the people calculating the scores okay let

462
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:39,880
us do first of all let us do our jobs don't come around bitching and bitching

463
00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:44,480
I don't understand you drove like three hours away from home, but if you're not gonna let us do our jobs

464
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:47,680
How the hell are we gonna get the whole tournament finished in the time?

465
00:38:48,920 --> 00:38:50,920
unfortunately the tournament

466
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:55,760
The PA tournament ended at 645 instead of six o'clock as expected

467
00:38:57,160 --> 00:38:59,700
Hmm, yeah, of course you get people fishing about

468
00:39:00,360 --> 00:39:03,480
certain people some people fishing about the pad issues, which is

469
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:07,880
Which started to be common in every tournament since b3 maybe?

470
00:39:07,880 --> 00:39:12,980
be where someone like bitch back oh the I got a great we should do a do because

471
00:39:12,980 --> 00:39:19,900
the arrows not working no the players not working it happened in Sundayville

472
00:39:19,900 --> 00:39:24,560
golf plan three numerous times were everyone had to play one pad because the

473
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:27,820
left side is not working I heard you took my suggestion though I heard that

474
00:39:27,820 --> 00:39:33,380
you actually made them all sign a form that says the rules are final and pad

475
00:39:33,380 --> 00:39:37,740
disputes will be didn't I had heard that you made everybody sign a form yes I did

476
00:39:37,740 --> 00:39:42,980
good good for you unfortunately some people like went out to the bear like

477
00:39:42,980 --> 00:39:47,820
some people went out of the barrier look what happens they got kicked out the one

478
00:39:47,820 --> 00:39:52,780
person got kicked out see this is what happens if you start drama you this is

479
00:39:52,780 --> 00:39:55,780
before the tournament you should have asked me questions personally and during

480
00:39:55,780 --> 00:39:59,980
the forms I'll see what I can do with the solution so it doesn't become a rush

481
00:39:59,980 --> 00:40:06,100
hour I think there should be a settlement process if there is reasonable

482
00:40:06,100 --> 00:40:10,260
doubt that the machine's malfunctioning, but you know, what that exactly is, does it take

483
00:40:10,260 --> 00:40:14,760
two people bitching, does it take whatever, you know, and then what's the process to review

484
00:40:14,760 --> 00:40:17,940
the machine, you know, you gotta set that all up in advance, I think once a reasonable

485
00:40:17,940 --> 00:40:22,180
process is established, there's really no way you can complain about it.

486
00:40:22,180 --> 00:40:26,020
But here's the thing though, it's a little debatable because sometimes the techs are

487
00:40:26,020 --> 00:40:32,780
not there to help, to help buy the parts, you know, like buy, let's see, you know like

488
00:40:32,780 --> 00:40:37,080
each arrow has four sensors itself right and buying 32 parts in case one of them

489
00:40:37,080 --> 00:40:41,160
goes dead is not really a reasonable solution because you're spending a lot

490
00:40:41,160 --> 00:40:45,520
of money itself because you know you're not owed the whole like vendors money

491
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:49,100
because they're spending parts on this so you're basically gonna be left in a

492
00:40:49,100 --> 00:40:54,160
deficit like right after the whole tournament is over the sad thing is is

493
00:40:54,160 --> 00:41:00,280
you could bring a brand new pad in there brand spanking new pad and somehow it's

494
00:41:00,280 --> 00:41:04,000
possible it could get fucked up during the tournament and it would not work so

495
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:08,000
you just have to I don't know you just sometimes have to just bite the bullet

496
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:11,280
and accept that things aren't always gonna work perfectly at the tournament

497
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:15,080
yeah I mean I understand that but I mean this is why it's like in my opinion I'm

498
00:41:15,080 --> 00:41:17,800
not trying to say like it's like unacceptable at some people might say

499
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:23,000
some people also have to check to check on player styles like freeze sort of

500
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:25,640
like freeze down the way you have to figure out ways to make sure you get the

501
00:41:25,640 --> 00:41:30,360
perfect rather than just try to cheat your way I mean here's I mean here's a

502
00:41:30,360 --> 00:41:32,720
here's an honorable here's a here's a question what would you rather have

503
00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:36,560
someone who would accept defeat or someone who likes to bitch too much so

504
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:39,720
they can get a do-over in favor they're part of the tournament so they can move

505
00:41:39,720 --> 00:41:44,080
up someone who takes the defeat and takes the criticism on how to get better

506
00:41:44,080 --> 00:41:49,220
of course yeah unfortunately it comes to a point where oh my god like here's a

507
00:41:49,220 --> 00:41:54,120
here's an example like one of the rounds I think somebody got the person like

508
00:41:54,120 --> 00:42:00,120
I'm not gonna say any names. The person got like 13 greats and then he claims

509
00:42:00,120 --> 00:42:05,460
that he got three greats on that song. Unfortunately he said, oh my god I got

510
00:42:05,460 --> 00:42:09,600
10 greats on the same arrow. We checked his playstyle, he's been getting the

511
00:42:09,600 --> 00:42:17,400
greats on the wrong arrow. Interesting. Yeah and then of course you got the

512
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:21,320
rules. Like I said before they should have asked beforehand so he can come up

513
00:42:21,320 --> 00:42:27,980
solutions. I mean, Tody did it, or should I say Andrew, he was worried about

514
00:42:27,980 --> 00:42:33,860
putting suggestions about dark mode. I added another option, which is one speed.

515
00:42:33,860 --> 00:42:37,860
Right. Like one of the two ways. Right. I'm not gonna make it, the tournament's more

516
00:42:37,860 --> 00:42:41,380
like an advanced format, it's not really like the same traditional format like

517
00:42:41,380 --> 00:42:45,860
everyone thinks it is. I'm thinking about using a traditional so people do,

518
00:42:45,860 --> 00:42:49,140
They'll cause less bitching for tournaments.

519
00:42:49,140 --> 00:42:51,500
Or cancel singles PA overall.

520
00:42:51,500 --> 00:42:53,800
Well, you know, you gotta just...

521
00:42:53,800 --> 00:42:56,940
It's one of those things where I think it gets to a point where if the rules are gonna

522
00:42:56,940 --> 00:43:00,300
be outside the box a little bit, then if you're a competitor, you gotta review the rules.

523
00:43:00,300 --> 00:43:01,660
And if it's not for you, don't enter.

524
00:43:01,660 --> 00:43:04,180
Wait for the next tournament.

525
00:43:04,180 --> 00:43:07,260
I'm not trying to blame...

526
00:43:07,260 --> 00:43:08,260
When we did...

527
00:43:08,260 --> 00:43:11,980
We did a tournament a while back and the qualifier...

528
00:43:11,980 --> 00:43:13,700
I don't remember which tournament this was.

529
00:43:13,700 --> 00:43:18,020
I want to say it was Shaft a while back a couple years ago. This was the one at Scandi

530
00:43:18,020 --> 00:43:21,540
It was the first one we did it was it was the same one. We had the 2d x-tournament at

531
00:43:23,140 --> 00:43:28,620
And the qualifier because it wasn't March Madness the qualifier had to be on dark reverse and

532
00:43:29,820 --> 00:43:33,900
We've the complaints were kind of minimal on it because we outlined physically no complaint

533
00:43:33,900 --> 00:43:39,020
we we outlined the rules in advance and said here are the songs and you'll have to do it dark reverse and

534
00:43:39,020 --> 00:43:41,940
And if you don't like it, don't enter.

535
00:43:41,940 --> 00:43:45,820
The thing is, I released the songs during the tournament.

536
00:43:45,820 --> 00:43:49,860
I said in the rules completely that the songs are going to be

537
00:43:49,860 --> 00:43:51,580
released during the tournament.

538
00:43:51,580 --> 00:43:55,060
There are 16 songs to choose from, from easy to hard.

539
00:43:55,060 --> 00:43:58,220
We did this really weird setup, and I wish I could find those

540
00:43:58,220 --> 00:44:00,620
rules again, because I think they're actually pretty good.

541
00:44:00,620 --> 00:44:03,460
But it was like, you could choose a song from list A, B,

542
00:44:03,460 --> 00:44:06,620
or C, and B would keep your score even.

543
00:44:06,620 --> 00:44:08,820
A would reduce your score automatically by a little bit,

544
00:44:08,820 --> 00:44:12,820
because they were easier songs and C would increase the score by a little bit because they were like 9-footers and hard songs.

545
00:44:12,820 --> 00:44:14,820
Yeah, I know that system. You guys did a tier system.

546
00:44:14,820 --> 00:44:15,820
Yeah.

547
00:44:15,820 --> 00:44:23,820
I mean, that was a system that worked very well. I was thinking about using it for Sacktown Smackdown or what people call piss.

548
00:44:23,820 --> 00:44:28,820
Unfortunately, considering that the community is starting to be a bitch hole.

549
00:44:28,820 --> 00:44:36,820
I'm not trying to say any names here, but it comes to a point where people are ruining the fun for everybody else.

550
00:44:36,820 --> 00:44:41,340
this is where I pissing all over it this is of course you seem like you see

551
00:44:41,340 --> 00:44:45,380
TOS like quitting tournaments because of it because they can't handle the

552
00:44:45,380 --> 00:44:50,940
situation and this is where I came in and take some take some numerous action

553
00:44:50,940 --> 00:44:56,980
eliminating though eliminating the pests all right well anything else in your

554
00:44:56,980 --> 00:45:01,860
week outside the tournament how else was your week and stuff okay I'll spend some

555
00:45:01,860 --> 00:45:05,220
more of the tournament later like probably at FU's um okay well it's been

556
00:45:05,220 --> 00:45:09,940
hell lately and oh yeah of course you got everyone knows about Ash Wednesday

557
00:45:09,940 --> 00:45:14,020
where they had to sacrifice something for 40 days and 40 nights oh yeah Lent

558
00:45:14,020 --> 00:45:19,340
okay any I got a question did anybody sacrifice anything for Lent? I sacrificed

559
00:45:19,340 --> 00:45:31,260
going to church. Wow. Now I and I'll do respect it's not my cup of tea for that

560
00:45:31,260 --> 00:45:38,180
stuff so no I didn't sell I don't celebrate one what'd you give up it's

561
00:45:38,180 --> 00:45:43,600
pretty it's pretty a shame you to say in Orange House radio I'll say it right now

562
00:45:43,600 --> 00:45:48,560
what I sacrificed getting a boner for Lent getting you wait wait you

563
00:45:48,560 --> 00:45:52,120
sacrificed getting a boner you are you're not allowed to get a boner for

564
00:45:52,120 --> 00:45:59,440
the next 40 days yes I sacrificed masturbating with my left hand it's

565
00:45:59,440 --> 00:46:03,620
Strictly right hand from now on wait. Wait, what are you gonna do?

566
00:46:03,620 --> 00:46:08,540
What are you gonna do it that hot asian girl with big boobs walks by you just gonna look the other way real quick before

567
00:46:08,860 --> 00:46:12,420
dirty thoughts that way that drinking a lot of water to gulp down and

568
00:46:15,900 --> 00:46:20,260
It's a tough decision it's like basically a lint that no man has gone before

569
00:46:21,500 --> 00:46:23,500
You got to tape it down

570
00:46:23,620 --> 00:46:29,100
That's what you're gonna have to do is you're going to have to tuck your penis back and make yourself have a vagina

571
00:46:29,100 --> 00:46:31,900
That's the only way you're gonna stop getting a boner all together.

572
00:46:31,900 --> 00:46:33,900
Oh boy, he really wants one of those!

573
00:46:33,900 --> 00:46:36,900
Even that is not, you know, foolproof either, I mean...

574
00:46:36,900 --> 00:46:39,900
That is like...

575
00:46:39,900 --> 00:46:44,900
I'd like to compare it to, like, the octopus, you know, where you have multiple brains, you know, octopuses...

576
00:46:44,900 --> 00:46:47,900
Octopi have multiple brains.

577
00:46:47,900 --> 00:46:52,900
They have brains to control their feet, or their tentacles, or whatever, and, you know, their normal brain.

578
00:46:52,900 --> 00:46:55,900
I'm sorry, but what's that signal? What do you see?

579
00:46:55,900 --> 00:47:00,420
What's hot girl signal has gone down to the air brain? It's all over what what are you gonna?

580
00:47:00,420 --> 00:47:03,700
Do if you wake up in the morning, and then you're like oh fuck

581
00:47:04,500 --> 00:47:09,620
God hates me. What are you gonna? Do so wait? Here's the thing so far. I've actually survived

582
00:47:09,820 --> 00:47:14,540
I'm not gonna need a boner. I've seen this attractive way, but no boner and

583
00:47:15,260 --> 00:47:18,700
I woke up no boner. I took a piss no boner

584
00:47:21,940 --> 00:47:23,940
Does like a semi-count

585
00:47:23,940 --> 00:47:27,940
And here's the thing, no I'm not taking any anti-viagra.

586
00:47:29,940 --> 00:47:31,940
Wow. Wow.

587
00:47:31,940 --> 00:47:37,940
So yes, it's a challenge, but I'm living up to my word. No boner for the next 40 days.

588
00:47:37,940 --> 00:47:40,940
I hate to say it, but keep us posted.

589
00:47:40,940 --> 00:47:42,940
It's on my LJ.

590
00:47:42,940 --> 00:47:43,940
Alright.

591
00:47:43,940 --> 00:47:45,940
For those who want to check out the-

592
00:47:45,940 --> 00:47:54,940
You know if he comes back here on day 39, I'm going to have like the rotating, you know, big-titted Asian prawn hentai, everything going on the screen in here.

593
00:47:54,940 --> 00:47:58,940
I should have like a sign that says, you know, gone this many days without wood.

594
00:48:01,940 --> 00:48:04,940
Wow. Amazing.

595
00:48:04,940 --> 00:48:08,940
That's amazing.

596
00:48:08,940 --> 00:48:14,940
Alright, my way...

597
00:48:14,940 --> 00:48:20,940
I could take that down the gutter even further, but for the sake of humanity I'm not going to.

598
00:48:20,940 --> 00:48:22,940
Good luck my friend, good luck, that's all I have to say.

599
00:48:22,940 --> 00:48:24,940
Oh come on man, we need time to kill.

600
00:48:24,940 --> 00:48:31,940
Nah, it's alright, it's alright. Trust me, you don't want me to go there.

601
00:48:31,940 --> 00:48:34,500
I'm sorry, I'm having a comedy show on my mind.

602
00:48:34,500 --> 00:48:36,420
And this is why we'll never make it...

603
00:48:36,420 --> 00:48:37,420
Seriously.

604
00:48:37,420 --> 00:48:44,660
The folks from Satellite Radio are listening right now, oh, we've just found out about

605
00:48:44,660 --> 00:48:49,180
this program that's all about gaming and these people here are all into gaming and they've

606
00:48:49,180 --> 00:48:51,420
done it for years, they gotta be good at this.

607
00:48:51,420 --> 00:48:52,420
Now they're tuning in.

608
00:48:52,420 --> 00:48:56,820
You're gonna get a boner in 40 days, you can't go 40 days without a boner.

609
00:48:56,820 --> 00:48:58,900
We're gonna put big-titted women on the screen.

610
00:48:58,900 --> 00:49:03,260
To tell you how much G4 has sold out to just, you know, selling everything with sex on their

611
00:49:03,260 --> 00:49:06,460
damn station, because that's, I guess, the only way they think it's going to work, they're

612
00:49:06,460 --> 00:49:13,380
going to have some football game coverage featuring the Lingerie Bowl girls.

613
00:49:13,380 --> 00:49:16,060
Oh yeah, that's game related.

614
00:49:16,060 --> 00:49:18,340
Oh yeah.

615
00:49:18,340 --> 00:49:20,700
Is that the Tech TV part of the station?

616
00:49:20,700 --> 00:49:21,700
I...

617
00:49:21,700 --> 00:49:22,700
Anyway.

618
00:49:22,700 --> 00:49:25,140
No, no, see, you forget.

619
00:49:25,140 --> 00:49:27,140
Tech TV's no longer part of the station.

620
00:49:27,140 --> 00:49:28,140
Oh, my bad.

621
00:49:28,140 --> 00:49:53,140
Anyway, my week and my day, since we didn't get around to it yet, my week and my day were pretty good. I went out to the clubs last night, you know, shaking my thing, and it's so hilarious when you hear DDR songs at the club. I know I'm such a loser for thinking that, but you know, we were dancing in the room where all the videos come on, and they played shiny disco balls, you know, from Ultramix.

622
00:49:53,140 --> 00:49:58,740
And I just to illusion in the chat room we call those weekdays

623
00:50:01,420 --> 00:50:03,420
What comment were you responding to

624
00:50:07,580 --> 00:50:10,460
Love the state said on the mic low key. We need to hear that

625
00:50:10,460 --> 00:50:16,960
I was responding to the comment Loki should have a spin-off show where he feels on big-breasted

626
00:50:17,180 --> 00:50:21,580
Asian girls and shouts racial slurs for two straight hours. I call those weekdays

627
00:50:21,580 --> 00:50:25,580
Alright, alright. I'm sorry explicit, you were saying?

628
00:50:25,580 --> 00:50:29,580
Speaking of that, guess what I heard in 24 Hour Fitness when I was working out?

629
00:50:29,580 --> 00:50:33,580
Someone asked to play- Butterfly! No.

630
00:50:33,580 --> 00:50:37,580
Era from TAC. What? I'm serious. I was working out

631
00:50:37,580 --> 00:50:41,580
with the wades, and I heard Era. I'm like

632
00:50:41,580 --> 00:50:45,580
what the fuck? On like the 24- what do they

633
00:50:45,580 --> 00:50:49,580
have in there? Like a 24 hour fitness radio station or music? No, they play it regular

634
00:50:49,580 --> 00:50:59,580
Any song that people put in their music box, they played some of the stuff from GDR Max, like Sandstorm.

635
00:50:59,580 --> 00:51:05,580
I know that Jamie had burned a CD for her spin group, they do the bike spin thing.

636
00:51:05,580 --> 00:51:09,580
But I don't know how many Bimani songs she put on. I think it was mostly like top 40 junk.

637
00:51:09,580 --> 00:51:13,580
And this was funny to burn one of these CDs for Jamie to have to make her, you know.

638
00:51:13,580 --> 00:51:15,580
But they had to get something that was friendly to everybody.

639
00:51:15,580 --> 00:51:20,860
She's like, and of course she comes to me, Rob, do you have Toxic by Britney?

640
00:51:20,860 --> 00:51:23,580
Oh wait, oh wait a minute, wait a minute.

641
00:51:23,580 --> 00:51:24,580
What, what?

642
00:51:24,580 --> 00:51:30,940
I see a comment about, laugh out loud, it's even more crazy to see someone doing DDR steps

643
00:51:30,940 --> 00:51:31,940
in clubs.

644
00:51:31,940 --> 00:51:32,940
Dude, I was just getting to that.

645
00:51:32,940 --> 00:51:37,420
When Shiny Disco Balls came on, I was kind of like dancing, like, Disco, Disco, Disco,

646
00:51:37,420 --> 00:51:39,420
like doing the little steps in UltraBates.

647
00:51:39,420 --> 00:51:42,500
Speaking of that, speaking of that, okay, this is, speaking of, speaking relating to

648
00:51:42,500 --> 00:51:47,060
the tournament I know it's over but I found out the reason why someone wanted to win first place

649
00:51:47,060 --> 00:51:53,220
was to take this girl to this junior prom and to realize I would I would imagine if he

650
00:51:54,100 --> 00:52:00,020
does DDR in the freaking prom wait wait wait wait wait some guy wanted to win the tournament

651
00:52:00,020 --> 00:52:05,060
because if he won the tournament like money stuff okay I thought I thought the girl wouldn't date

652
00:52:05,060 --> 00:52:10,900
him unless he won the tournament type I know the girl too okay that's a really bad setup for like

653
00:52:10,900 --> 00:52:16,600
DDR freak the movie you know like never mind yeah yeah you know this is

654
00:52:16,600 --> 00:52:23,580
ridiculous it's very sad but true you basically have to rip off the whole

655
00:52:23,580 --> 00:52:28,780
storyline for 10k commotion I'm not having another DDR freak movie

656
00:52:28,780 --> 00:52:37,540
discussion I'm not having it again on the show the only way no other way none

657
00:52:37,540 --> 00:52:45,200
this robot chick Asian person dancer no never can I talk about my week I guess

658
00:52:45,200 --> 00:52:49,280
all right so Friday night Friday night I was hanging out with some friends and we

659
00:52:49,280 --> 00:52:53,360
went over to rice princesses house you know the one from outside the box

660
00:52:53,360 --> 00:52:55,920
although we haven't really done outside the box in several weeks which I

661
00:52:55,920 --> 00:52:59,760
apologize guys for but you know there's just been other circumstances coming up

662
00:52:59,760 --> 00:53:05,680
and the show may be moved or retooled in the near future so I appreciate those

663
00:53:05,680 --> 00:53:09,100
you guys who are bearing with us, but we just have a lot of other crap that's been getting

664
00:53:09,100 --> 00:53:15,400
in the way, so something might change with that. Anyway, um, but as far as Friday nights

665
00:53:15,400 --> 00:53:19,940
go, I saw, for the very first time in my life, and I know this is hard to believe, I had

666
00:53:19,940 --> 00:53:26,340
never seen The Fifth Element before, the movie. I finally saw it Friday night. It was very,

667
00:53:26,340 --> 00:53:34,140
um, gay, really. Like the costumes and everything, and, no, I don't know how to describe it.

668
00:53:34,140 --> 00:53:37,660
it was alright I guess. Although the thing I thought was kind of cool about the fifth

669
00:53:37,660 --> 00:53:43,560
element was that it was kind of like a video game plot. It really was. It was a total video

670
00:53:43,560 --> 00:53:50,720
game plot. Anyway. So I guess that was pretty much it. I mean my weekend was the only exciting

671
00:53:50,720 --> 00:53:55,320
part of my week I guess. I didn't have a whole lot else going on. I was kind of lazy. Oh

672
00:53:55,320 --> 00:54:01,400
well. Alright. Any other comments before we go to break? Chirp, chirp, chirp, chirp. Explicit?

00:54:01,400 --> 00:54:06,740

For the end, for the end

01:00:14,780 --> 01:00:25,780
Why, why, why should I?

Hi ho, Kermit the Frog here informing you that today's broadcast of Orange Lounge Radio

693
01:01:36,260 --> 01:01:45,880
is brought to you by the letter B, the letter A, and the number 59.

694
01:01:45,880 --> 01:01:50,880
We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 131.

695
01:01:50,880 --> 01:01:56,040
A happy early Valentine's Day to all of you people out there, or Singles Awareness Day,

696
01:01:56,040 --> 01:01:58,360
whatever the case may be for you.

697
01:01:58,360 --> 01:02:00,800
As promised, we're going to talk about some Bimani news right now.

698
01:02:00,800 --> 01:02:06,360
Big news, Dancing Stage Unleashed 2, at least if you're in Europe, this will be big news

699
01:02:06,360 --> 01:02:11,120
to you, for everybody else, not so big a news, but at least there's a new DDR game on the

700
01:02:11,120 --> 01:02:12,120
way.

701
01:02:12,120 --> 01:02:14,120
What do you know?

702
01:02:14,120 --> 01:02:17,780
tracks have already been announced for this game pretty cool basement jacks

703
01:02:17,780 --> 01:02:24,820
where's your head at girls allowed love machine happy Mondays step on super

704
01:02:24,820 --> 01:02:33,320
grass all right Donna summer hot stuff the jam a town called malice all of them

705
01:02:33,320 --> 01:02:37,160
supposedly supposed to have the background videos to them as well very

706
01:02:37,160 --> 01:02:40,760
interesting also you know what else basically by the way for those who don't

707
01:02:40,760 --> 01:02:47,520
Dancing Stage Unleashed, it's basically gonna be their version of Ultramix 2, so

708
01:02:47,520 --> 01:02:50,960
they're getting that. What's very interesting about this, though, the rumor

709
01:02:50,960 --> 01:02:55,720
is is that you're gonna be able to play this on Xbox Live. You'll be able to play

710
01:02:55,720 --> 01:03:02,640
against people in the US if you're in Canada, but only on those songs that the

711
01:03:02,640 --> 01:03:07,320
two games share. So that should be interesting, though, is that now you can

712
01:03:07,320 --> 01:03:10,240
settle the score with any of your buddies that live in Europe. You can

713
01:03:10,240 --> 01:03:16,320
actually play on Xbox Live against them? Loki, your thoughts on Unleashed 2?

714
01:03:16,320 --> 01:03:22,080
Really just nothing new as far as, you know, gameplay features other than, you know, the

715
01:03:22,080 --> 01:03:28,440
online thing. I'm interested to see, though, because you know how Ultramix 2, they had

716
01:03:28,440 --> 01:03:34,000
their deal with a different drum, what they're going to do as far as, you know, the extra

717
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:38,120
music for this, you know, game. I wonder if they're going to team up with, like, maybe

718
01:03:38,120 --> 01:03:43,880
a UK label or something like that. That would be what I'm waiting for to see what's going

719
01:03:43,880 --> 01:03:48,520
to happen there.

720
01:03:48,520 --> 01:03:55,260
Any thoughts on Unleashed 2 from Angel or Explicit?

721
01:03:55,260 --> 01:03:59,780
Sounds pretty cool. I mean, there's a couple songs that they always get that we don't that

722
01:03:59,780 --> 01:04:04,800
I wish that we had, but you know, I can keep wishing, whatever.

723
01:04:04,800 --> 01:04:08,560
I know, it seems like Europe always gets these awesome licenses, don't they?

724
01:04:08,560 --> 01:04:11,440
Basie and Jax is awesome, and they're getting... oh man.

725
01:04:11,440 --> 01:04:16,160
See? Now you're bummed too. I know, a little bit. I want them all. I want all those here, but I'm

726
01:04:16,160 --> 01:04:19,880
tempted to get a Europe PS2 at this point, although this is going to be for Xbox.

727
01:04:19,880 --> 01:04:22,900
I still want a Europe PS2 just to get, like, all the games,

728
01:04:22,900 --> 01:04:26,360
but of course then I'd have to get the converter, so the TV would show it.

729
01:04:26,360 --> 01:04:29,100
It's just not worth it that much. I don't know.

730
01:04:29,100 --> 01:04:34,780
explicit your thoughts well i'm thinking it's it's just the same songs and same in different

731
01:04:34,780 --> 01:04:39,180
steps like the new songs and new steps that's basically i'm hearing so far i mean we got xbox

732
01:04:39,180 --> 01:04:45,180
flight like stated earlier i don't know it looks like it's like every time they release like the

733
01:04:45,180 --> 01:04:49,660
dancing stage is like the same old stuff i mean there's a i don't know it might have been i think

734
01:04:49,660 --> 01:04:53,820
there should be like more new stuff maybe but i'm not gonna judge it from a cover until it's

735
01:04:53,820 --> 01:04:58,620
released good thought i never want i'll never judge a game until the game is released and i

736
01:04:58,620 --> 01:05:01,420
actually play it. I would be interested to know if they're gonna get the song

737
01:05:01,420 --> 01:05:06,500
packs as well. Because that would be a whole lot of songs that you could play

738
01:05:06,500 --> 01:05:12,060
you know against because how many songs is it gonna share with Ultramix 2? I

739
01:05:12,060 --> 01:05:15,580
don't know probably I mean I guess you can probably bet that most of the

740
01:05:15,580 --> 01:05:19,220
Konami originals are going to carry over things like I don't know Zero One, Route

741
01:05:19,220 --> 01:05:26,540
80, but I don't know will they all who knows we don't know yet so we shall see.

742
01:05:26,540 --> 01:05:31,100
but then we always have step mania if it's but then we always have step mania

743
01:05:31,100 --> 01:05:37,420
in case yeah you don't get the songs yeah like ultramix 3 or extreme 2 or even

744
01:05:37,420 --> 01:05:41,060
with DDR with Mario you know I'm just looking forward to getting to kick some

745
01:05:41,060 --> 01:05:46,340
British ass on Xbox live actually no I'm kidding I'm gonna get hate mail from

746
01:05:46,340 --> 01:05:50,900
that one actually I can't wait to start hearing some of those sexy sexy accents

747
01:05:50,900 --> 01:05:57,760
through the speaker name some you know the hello I hope you having a good day

748
01:05:57,760 --> 01:06:06,440
would you like to do some TD on then have some tea I'm getting so much hate

749
01:06:06,440 --> 01:06:08,960
mail from anybody that's listening to this in Europe right now I'm just I'm

750
01:06:08,960 --> 01:06:12,560
just joking okay I'm in California haha we all have blonde hair and blue eyes

751
01:06:12,560 --> 01:06:13,560
and go surfing, huh?

752
01:06:13,560 --> 01:06:14,560
What?

753
01:06:14,560 --> 01:06:18,560
They speak to you in the spagnole of Francais.

754
01:06:18,560 --> 01:06:22,560
Oh, that could be interesting because you might be playing people in other countries.

755
01:06:22,560 --> 01:06:23,560
Is that possible?

756
01:06:23,560 --> 01:06:27,560
Do they sell the stuff outside of Britain?

757
01:06:27,560 --> 01:06:29,560
Do they sell it in like France, Spain?

758
01:06:29,560 --> 01:06:30,560
I don't even know.

759
01:06:30,560 --> 01:06:31,560
I don't know either.

760
01:06:31,560 --> 01:06:32,560
I imagine it wouldn't be that hard yet.

761
01:06:32,560 --> 01:06:35,560
Everything is done by the whole European system.

762
01:06:35,560 --> 01:06:40,560
It's not just the British anymore.

763
01:06:40,560 --> 01:06:45,560
Let's get the Japanese on there, too. Let's settle this once and for all. Seriously.

764
01:06:45,560 --> 01:06:47,560
Blank. Blank.

765
01:06:47,560 --> 01:06:54,560
Come on. Who cares if we can't speak the same language? We can speak the universal language of kickin' ass.

766
01:06:54,560 --> 01:06:58,560
Or, or, or, or, or, or, or, or whatever some French is.

767
01:06:58,560 --> 01:06:59,560
Oh, get it up.

768
01:06:59,560 --> 01:07:03,560
Did I tell you about the last time I, uh, beaten an Asian on DDR?

769
01:07:03,560 --> 01:07:04,560
Wait, what?

770
01:07:04,560 --> 01:07:06,560
Even though that was a long-ass time ago.

771
01:07:06,560 --> 01:07:08,560
What was this, Angel? What?

772
01:07:08,560 --> 01:07:13,060
Oh, I actually, uh, beat an Asian playing, uh, DDR6 mix.

773
01:07:13,060 --> 01:07:15,060
How old was she, six?

774
01:07:15,060 --> 01:07:18,060
I'm just kidding! I'm just kidding!

775
01:07:19,060 --> 01:07:21,060
He was, like, nineteen or something.

776
01:07:21,060 --> 01:07:22,060
That's cool.

777
01:07:22,060 --> 01:07:24,060
And he couldn't- he didn't believe that, like,

778
01:07:24,060 --> 01:07:29,060
there was actually American people playing DDR and all that stuff, and...

779
01:07:29,060 --> 01:07:31,060
It was kind of funny.

780
01:07:31,060 --> 01:07:33,060
Hm. That's cool.

781
01:07:33,060 --> 01:07:34,060
Anyways.

782
01:07:34,060 --> 01:07:37,060
It was in the middle of Japan, and we know this.

783
01:07:37,060 --> 01:07:39,060
This is like two years ago.

784
01:07:39,060 --> 01:07:42,060
And it's so funny because you know some folks make the assumption that instantly,

785
01:07:42,060 --> 01:07:45,060
Oh, we're all gonna get killed by the Japanese on DDR if this happens.

786
01:07:45,060 --> 01:07:50,060
But you know what? Just like their shitty American players, they're shitty Japanese players.

787
01:07:50,060 --> 01:07:54,060
Everybody's new to DDR at some point, so you know, you gotta start somewhere.

788
01:07:54,060 --> 01:08:00,060
Until you watch some Japanese girl walk up to the TDX machine and just completely own everyone else.

789
01:08:00,060 --> 01:08:02,060
That was insane. Okay.

790
01:08:02,060 --> 01:08:07,060
Anyways, you've got people saying, yo quiero, DDR!

791
01:08:07,060 --> 01:08:09,060
Oh my god.

792
01:08:09,060 --> 01:08:12,060
Just stop. Seriously, stop.

793
01:08:12,060 --> 01:08:13,060
Okay, okay.

794
01:08:13,060 --> 01:08:14,060
Alright.

795
01:08:14,060 --> 01:08:16,060
I'll stop with the...

796
01:08:16,060 --> 01:08:19,060
More news going on. Actually, I don't know if you guys noticed, but

797
01:08:19,060 --> 01:08:23,060
DDR Freak had a whole lot of news this week. I'm sure a lot of you guys are watching DDR Freak.

798
01:08:23,060 --> 01:08:28,060
And we, of course, have to show a little love to DDR Freak because they replay us on their Friday nights on DDR Freak Radio.

799
01:08:28,060 --> 01:08:34,220
Freak Radio. Kisses. So they have a lot of stuff. And really what I've noticed this week

800
01:08:34,220 --> 01:08:39,540
is a whole lot of looking for people. They're looking for people. There's all sorts of stuff.

801
01:08:39,540 --> 01:08:44,600
It's like casting calls left and right. They're looking for people. It's interesting. Speaking

802
01:08:44,600 --> 01:08:51,500
of Yo Quiero DDR, a Spanish language network was looking for a Spanish speaking DDR player.

803
01:08:51,500 --> 01:08:54,700
We don't know what's going on. I don't know what ended up happening with that. I didn't

804
01:08:54,700 --> 01:09:00,040
reading the comments, but they were looking for somebody. First For Women magazine was

805
01:09:00,040 --> 01:09:05,280
looking for a mother who lost weight playing DDR with their kid, which I think, you know

806
01:09:05,280 --> 01:09:09,340
what, I think that's kind of neat. That's kind of cool. I know my mom wouldn't even

807
01:09:09,340 --> 01:09:12,360
know how to turn on a PlayStation, let alone get up and play DDR.

808
01:09:12,360 --> 01:09:15,480
I know some mothers who have like five-year-old children.

809
01:09:15,480 --> 01:09:21,640
Cool mommies, not mine. And this is a call that everybody could participate on. This

810
01:09:21,640 --> 01:09:23,680
This is what I thought was really cool.

811
01:09:23,680 --> 01:09:26,640
DDR Freak was helping out the Make-A-Wish Foundation of Indiana.

812
01:09:26,640 --> 01:09:29,760
They were helping this child's dream come true.

813
01:09:29,760 --> 01:09:34,800
This child, Robbie, has a kidney disease, and his wish was for a game room in his home

814
01:09:34,800 --> 01:09:36,260
featuring DDR.

815
01:09:36,260 --> 01:09:42,160
So they just rallied the troops together to buy him just like the supremo setup for DDR.

816
01:09:42,160 --> 01:09:43,260
So that's kind of cool.

817
01:09:43,260 --> 01:09:44,620
If you're interested in that, check it out.

818
01:09:44,620 --> 01:09:49,640
It's the February 10th headline over on DDRFreak.com, certainly worth participating in.

819
01:09:49,640 --> 01:09:54,860
And Red Octane, this was just announced recently, Red Octane is going to be doing a focus group

820
01:09:54,860 --> 01:09:59,140
in Sunnyvale this Friday and next Friday.

821
01:09:59,140 --> 01:10:02,920
And I guess if you participate, which by the way is at 7 o'clock, you have to have your

822
01:10:02,920 --> 01:10:06,120
own transportation to Sunnyvale, so if you're on the East Coast, sorry, you're screwed,

823
01:10:06,120 --> 01:10:10,860
but if you're somewhere in the Bay Area, Red Octane will provide dinner, I wonder what

824
01:10:10,860 --> 01:10:14,980
kind of dinner?

825
01:10:14,980 --> 01:10:18,220
Maybe I should write and inquire, are we going to get Black Angus, or are you going to get

826
01:10:18,220 --> 01:10:19,220
like, you know, McD's?

827
01:10:19,220 --> 01:10:20,220
Interesting.

828
01:10:20,220 --> 01:10:26,500
Maybe I can talk to Red Octane, but unfortunately I can't make it those Friday, Thursday, Friday,

829
01:10:26,500 --> 01:10:27,500
or Saturday.

830
01:10:27,500 --> 01:10:31,420
It's Friday, February 18th and Friday, February 25th at 7 o'clock.

831
01:10:31,420 --> 01:10:33,940
Maybe the 25th I could maybe make it.

832
01:10:33,940 --> 01:10:35,840
I know that this week I cannot.

833
01:10:35,840 --> 01:10:39,500
You know what, what's funny is I'm actually tempted to sign up for it.

834
01:10:39,500 --> 01:10:43,500
I'm so damn curious.

835
01:10:43,500 --> 01:10:44,500
I'm very tempted.

836
01:10:44,500 --> 01:10:45,500
That's all I have to say.

837
01:10:45,500 --> 01:10:47,500
You know, it's also pretty interesting as well.

838
01:10:47,500 --> 01:10:51,500
A tournament is also the day after, too.

839
01:10:51,500 --> 01:10:53,500
Another tournament in Milpitas.

840
01:10:53,500 --> 01:10:55,500
Another one? What are they doing this time?

841
01:10:55,500 --> 01:10:57,500
It's also what Red Octane is involved in as well.

842
01:10:57,500 --> 01:10:59,500
It's called Got Skill.

843
01:11:01,500 --> 01:11:03,500
I wish I could go, but I can't.

844
01:11:03,500 --> 01:11:11,500
Plus, people say it's a bad idea to even go anyways because, you know, some people will still get heated up with drama from the last tournament.

845
01:11:11,500 --> 01:11:15,500
It's just stupid. People should grow... I mean, I don't want that...

846
01:11:15,500 --> 01:11:18,500
Which is the reason why I won't be going as well.

847
01:11:18,500 --> 01:11:21,500
So I'll let people take care of their business there.

848
01:11:21,500 --> 01:11:25,500
You're a bitter, bitter man after some of these tournaments, aren't you?

849
01:11:25,500 --> 01:11:30,500
No, because I'm only bitter to those who cannot accept defeat or think they're like 100% correct.

850
01:11:30,500 --> 01:11:34,500
When they're obviously not, they can't admit their own mistakes.

851
01:11:34,500 --> 01:11:38,500
Instead of trying to get better, they just whine.

852
01:11:38,500 --> 01:11:40,500
So, I'm just going to leave it as is.

853
01:11:40,500 --> 01:11:45,500
is. Some of the competitors I know are going to go there, like, some of the Sacktown people

854
01:11:45,500 --> 01:11:51,780
of Team Piss or... There's actually a Team Piss now? No, just Team Piss. Oh, okay. Some

855
01:11:51,780 --> 01:11:55,780
people call it the Paradise Island Sacktown Squad, but you just call it Team P.I. Not

856
01:11:55,780 --> 01:12:04,240
Team Piss. Interesting. No more piss jokes now. I'm trying. Alright, if you guys are

857
01:12:04,240 --> 01:12:10,360
interested in the Red Octane focus group, you can check that out on www.ddrfreak.com.

858
01:12:10,360 --> 01:12:14,320
I'm sure there will be non-disclosure agreements involved, so even if we do get to check it

859
01:12:14,320 --> 01:12:18,720
out, if I do decide I want to put in and I get picked, I probably won't be able to talk

860
01:12:18,720 --> 01:12:25,080
about it, but, you know, it'll be still kind of neat to see. So, we'll see. We will see.

861
01:12:25,080 --> 01:12:29,680
Moving on. This is big news. This is huge. This is huge news.

862
01:12:29,680 --> 01:12:30,680
How huge?

863
01:12:30,680 --> 01:12:31,840
Huge. Bigger than big.

864
01:12:31,840 --> 01:12:39,000
You know that other dancing game? Not in the groove, but the other one, the Korean one.

865
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:40,000
Pump It Up.

866
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:41,320
Oh, what about it?

867
01:12:41,320 --> 01:12:46,080
Pump It Up Exceed is going to be released in North America on the PlayStation 2.

868
01:12:46,080 --> 01:12:47,080
Yes, I heard about it.

869
01:12:47,080 --> 01:12:48,080
Very interesting, huh?

870
01:12:48,080 --> 01:12:52,880
How are you supposed to release Exceed 2, not just Exceed?

871
01:12:52,880 --> 01:12:58,720
Well, here it is. This is the press release straight from InsertCredit.com. Mastiff has

872
01:12:58,720 --> 01:13:04,280
announced that it will be publishing Andamiro's Pump It Up Exceed for Playstation 2 and Xbox

873
01:13:04,280 --> 01:13:10,840
in North America in June. They made the announcement at the Metreon and we had an ace Pump It Up

874
01:13:10,840 --> 01:13:14,520
player named Smidget there and they were strutting their stuff on an arcade and a home version

875
01:13:14,520 --> 01:13:19,100
of the Dance Mat game. The Pump It Up franchise, according to this press release, has sold

876
01:13:19,100 --> 01:13:25,540
over a quarter million copies of the arcade versions and PC versions thus far. Now you'll

877
01:13:25,540 --> 01:13:27,780
You'll notice they don't say what country.

878
01:13:27,780 --> 01:13:31,500
I already know what countries have been selling Pump It Up pretty well.

879
01:13:31,500 --> 01:13:36,140
I imagine the PC version isn't doing too badly, but probably not so much in this country.

880
01:13:36,140 --> 01:13:39,420
Although, you know, Red Octane has it in their store, and I imagine a lot of people pick

881
01:13:39,420 --> 01:13:40,420
it up through there.

882
01:13:40,420 --> 01:13:41,420
Here's the thing, though.

883
01:13:41,420 --> 01:13:45,420
Let's see, Pump It Up's more international than DDR, because I know Pump It Up's mainly

884
01:13:45,420 --> 01:13:53,140
supported in Mexico and mainly South America as well, because America mainly DDR overpopulated

885
01:13:53,140 --> 01:13:54,880
the whole franchise.

886
01:13:54,880 --> 01:13:56,440
You got your pump fans, though.

887
01:13:56,440 --> 01:13:59,560
I mean, like, overall, compared to, like, other countries.

888
01:13:59,560 --> 01:14:05,320
I know Mexico popularizes Pump It Up, Argentina, Chile, or anywhere in South America.

889
01:14:05,320 --> 01:14:08,520
Yeah, I've heard the same thing, a lot of South American countries really big on Pump

890
01:14:08,520 --> 01:14:13,000
It Up, as well as a lot of the countries in the East that aren't Japan or China, a lot

891
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:14,600
of those, like, other countries.

892
01:14:14,600 --> 01:14:15,600
Korean, Korea.

893
01:14:15,600 --> 01:14:16,600
Yeah, definitely.

894
01:14:16,600 --> 01:14:21,100
I'm not sure what other places support Pump It Up, as well.

895
01:14:21,100 --> 01:14:25,660
It should be noted this is not going to be the exact same as the Korean PS2 version that

896
01:14:25,660 --> 01:14:30,040
was just launched because there's going to be some exclusive songs, including a song

897
01:14:30,040 --> 01:14:34,480
by Stereogram called Walkie Talkie Man, and it's going to have the actual video that runs

898
01:14:34,480 --> 01:14:35,480
in the background.

899
01:14:35,480 --> 01:14:37,920
For those of you guys who haven't seen it, it's like a claymation video.

900
01:14:37,920 --> 01:14:39,080
It's kind of a rock song.

901
01:14:39,080 --> 01:14:40,960
It's not your typical dance song.

902
01:14:40,960 --> 01:14:43,140
It's kind of more of a rockish song.

903
01:14:43,140 --> 01:14:49,040
But then again, a lot of the Korean songs in Pump It Up were kind of rock songs, so

904
01:14:49,040 --> 01:14:51,400
It kind of makes sense why they're doing this.

905
01:14:51,400 --> 01:14:52,920
So what do you guys think?

906
01:14:52,920 --> 01:14:54,240
Good idea, bad idea?

907
01:14:54,240 --> 01:14:55,400
I mean, it's a great idea, but I just

908
01:14:55,400 --> 01:14:58,240
want to know how the axis system is going to work.

909
01:14:58,240 --> 01:15:01,760
You know how Pump It Up has the middle and the diagonals.

910
01:15:01,760 --> 01:15:04,440
I'm not sure how the pads are going to work on this.

911
01:15:04,440 --> 01:15:07,280
That's my first initial thought, is that Pump It Up immediately

912
01:15:07,280 --> 01:15:11,000
has a kind of, they're screwed out the gate.

913
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:13,740
Because all these third party pads and stuff,

914
01:15:13,740 --> 01:15:16,860
unless they do some kind of axis tilting, which even then

915
01:15:16,860 --> 01:15:19,860
wouldn't really work because you wouldn't have a middle button I don't

916
01:15:19,860 --> 01:15:22,940
know how they do it if you could do autoplay on the middle which wouldn't

917
01:15:22,940 --> 01:15:27,260
really be the game then there's really no way to get these third-party pads to

918
01:15:27,260 --> 01:15:32,780
work unless the third-party pad has all the buttons I don't know is a nine

919
01:15:32,780 --> 01:15:36,000
square pad or something the lack of a center button is really gonna screw

920
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:43,460
things up Loki there are the what pads are those there the I want to say cold

921
01:15:43,460 --> 01:15:50,220
But, Cobalt Flux pads do have the center button, so those will be able to be used, but those

922
01:15:50,220 --> 01:15:52,420
are like high-end ones.

923
01:15:52,420 --> 01:15:57,780
As nice of a pad as Cobalt Flux is, how popular is it really?

924
01:15:57,780 --> 01:16:01,060
It's not the kind of thing you walk into GameStop and purchase, right?

925
01:16:01,060 --> 01:16:05,940
I had a hard enough time finding an Ignition 2.0 locally, and even when I bought an Ignition

926
01:16:05,940 --> 01:16:10,940
2.0, I spent $100 on an Aspad, they were like, we've never sold one of these before, you're

927
01:16:10,940 --> 01:16:12,900
You're actually going to buy this?

928
01:16:12,900 --> 01:16:15,540
The fuck is wrong with you?

929
01:16:15,540 --> 01:16:18,180
And I was just kind of like, it's a good pad.

930
01:16:18,180 --> 01:16:21,380
I don't want to spend 20 bucks on the cheap pad that's going to break next week.

931
01:16:21,380 --> 01:16:26,380
But again, it all goes back to the fact that, you know, these Pump It Up pads aren't as

932
01:16:26,380 --> 01:16:28,580
easily buyable in the store.

933
01:16:28,580 --> 01:16:32,140
How likable is it that these places are going to want to buy these pads and stock them in

934
01:16:32,140 --> 01:16:33,140
the store?

935
01:16:33,140 --> 01:16:36,180
I think it brings a lot of confusion to the market in a way.

936
01:16:36,180 --> 01:16:37,180
Very confusing.

937
01:16:37,180 --> 01:16:40,060
I mean, first of all, Pump It Up is a very hard game to learn.

938
01:16:40,060 --> 01:16:45,300
You know, cause you know how, you know how like many, same idea, you see this thing,

939
01:16:45,300 --> 01:16:50,500
you step on it, granted it might be a little bit, I mean the problem is like so many like,

940
01:16:50,500 --> 01:16:55,420
like this is coming from the Pump It Up player itself, um, I play Pump It Up, and I've seen

941
01:16:55,420 --> 01:17:00,180
like numerous like people who are just looking over DDR than Pump It Up, so you know, they

942
01:17:00,180 --> 01:17:04,260
think Pump It Up is like a rip off of DDR because it has the same arrows, and it's hard

943
01:17:04,260 --> 01:17:08,900
to play cause it's diagonals, you know, they just want to say something simple like up,

944
01:17:08,900 --> 01:17:13,000
down left right it's really not the same dance style though it's really not it's

945
01:17:13,000 --> 01:17:16,480
really isn't I think pump it up is easier to freestyle to I think a lot of

946
01:17:16,480 --> 01:17:21,000
the songs you automatically like your body's an emotion where you're giving a

947
01:17:21,000 --> 01:17:24,040
lot of room on freestyle itself and pump it up and like I said it's a real

948
01:17:24,040 --> 01:17:29,040
different type of music too it's my problem with it and this is the big one

949
01:17:29,040 --> 01:17:34,200
how the fuck are you gonna be able to play those extreme and crazy songs that

950
01:17:34,200 --> 01:17:38,200
That is true. There's one song that's impossible to even beat.

951
01:17:38,200 --> 01:17:46,200
There's where they have the four or five, you know, button mashing. I mean, it's just not fun.

952
01:17:46,200 --> 01:17:56,200
That's my main complaint about Pump It Up to the Game is those crazy songs where you have to do, like, knee drops and shit. No thanks.

953
01:17:56,200 --> 01:18:00,200
Well, that was my issue with In the Groove, but we're not talking about that game right now.

954
01:18:00,200 --> 01:18:01,200
In the Groove is a different game than the...

955
01:18:01,200 --> 01:18:03,200
Yeah, I know. Anyway...

956
01:18:03,200 --> 01:18:10,780
Well, I've said this at least like every week for the past few weeks, my beef with In The

957
01:18:10,780 --> 01:18:18,000
Groove is that, and specifically In The Groove's fan base, sorry guys, but this is my beef,

958
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:25,520
is that In The Groove is not DDR, unless it's convenient for it to be DDR, because whenever

959
01:18:25,520 --> 01:18:29,100
people bitch about, you know, a lack of DDR, then they go, oh well there's always In The

960
01:18:29,100 --> 01:18:34,700
groove I thought you just said in the groove wasn't DDR that's my number one

961
01:18:34,700 --> 01:18:38,460
complaint here I mean some people confused they're basically two different

962
01:18:38,460 --> 01:18:43,460
games you have different timing different music different options it's

963
01:18:43,460 --> 01:18:47,780
all different some people say they're trying to compare like oh in the group

964
01:18:47,780 --> 01:18:55,480
is DDR night mix and no no I wouldn't go that far I I but I think for the most

965
01:18:55,480 --> 01:18:59,080
part in the groove you know I've said this before in the groove kind of

966
01:18:59,080 --> 01:19:10,080
It is DDR. It's just, but it's evolved. It's evolved DDR. They're beating Konami to the punch. That's what they're doing. I mean, whatever.

967
01:19:10,080 --> 01:19:16,080
But anyways, back to what I was talking about.

968
01:19:16,080 --> 01:19:17,080
Pump.

969
01:19:17,080 --> 01:19:27,080
Pump it up, yeah. I just want to see how the game turns out and how many songs it can fit. They said the PS2 hardware could actually handle it, and Xbox hardware still could handle it.

970
01:19:27,080 --> 01:19:28,080
Oh yeah.

971
01:19:28,080 --> 01:19:48,080
I don't see this game doing well because of the fact that I think, and this is kind of ironic, I think a lot of places are going to view it, and remember folks, you and I, you being the Bamani addict because you're actually taking time to tune in and listen to this show, you and I understand the differences between DDR and Pump It Up.

972
01:19:48,080 --> 01:19:56,080
But, the casual gamer, somebody who walks into a game, a parent who walks into a game and stops buying the stuff for their kid, are they going to really understand the difference?

973
01:19:56,080 --> 01:20:01,080
No. And the people who are supplying this, I think a lot of people are going to view it as a cheap knockoff of DDR.

974
01:20:01,080 --> 01:20:03,080
Yeah, obviously.

975
01:20:03,080 --> 01:20:09,080
I think that's the way the casual gamer is going to look at it. Now, but here's the thing, if the price is right, that could help it.

976
01:20:09,080 --> 01:20:13,080
You know, somebody wants to get into the dance thing and...

977
01:20:13,080 --> 01:20:19,580
According to how they view, that's just like, just because Pump It has a stepping arrow does not mean it's a rip-off of the year.

978
01:20:19,580 --> 01:20:28,280
Look at other games, like, that's just like saying, ooh, there's a lot of Mario knock-offs, or there's a lot of Doom knock-offs, and et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.

979
01:20:28,280 --> 01:20:30,280
I can keep going on and on and on about...

980
01:20:30,280 --> 01:20:35,080
Here's the thing, again, again, you're talking about the casual gamer versus the addict, the dance game addict.

981
01:20:35,080 --> 01:20:38,580
The casual gamer, what you can see that a game is not Mario.

982
01:20:38,580 --> 01:20:43,300
You can see that this game is not Mario, but you see that this is another dance game with

983
01:20:43,300 --> 01:20:45,980
arrows that scroll up to the top of the screen, that you hit them.

984
01:20:45,980 --> 01:20:47,940
You and I understand the difference.

985
01:20:47,940 --> 01:20:48,940
Most people don't.

986
01:20:48,940 --> 01:20:56,740
Sadly, that's true, unfortunately, because so many people are so narrow-minded to judge

987
01:20:56,740 --> 01:21:00,520
from their first impressions without getting a chance to look deeply what the game is all

988
01:21:00,520 --> 01:21:01,520
about.

989
01:21:01,520 --> 01:21:06,300
It's like, ooh, they say, ooh, Resident Evil, or anything they see is popular, they're going

990
01:21:06,300 --> 01:21:14,220
to buy it, regardless if the game is either good or bad, you just look from their eyes,

991
01:21:14,220 --> 01:21:20,820
which kind of makes me wonder if people are paying attention to what they purchase and

992
01:21:20,820 --> 01:21:21,820
stuff.

993
01:21:21,820 --> 01:21:25,660
I think the price has a lot to do with it.

994
01:21:25,660 --> 01:21:30,660
I'd be very curious to know how that little Mad Catz game is selling right now, that shitty

995
01:21:30,660 --> 01:21:34,700
little Mad Catz GameCube game, the dance game, I'd be very curious to know how that's doing

996
01:21:34,700 --> 01:21:35,700
right now.

997
01:21:35,700 --> 01:21:39,700
I don't think it's doing too hot, but I'd be very curious to know.

998
01:21:39,700 --> 01:21:43,700
From my source, I think it's not doing good at all,

999
01:21:43,700 --> 01:21:47,700
considering that some people actually played it.

1000
01:21:47,700 --> 01:21:51,700
But again, the people that you're talking to are DDR

1001
01:21:51,700 --> 01:21:55,700
and Bamani addicts. I'm not talking about DDR, I'm talking about casual gamers.

1002
01:21:55,700 --> 01:21:59,700
Not just DDR addicts and stuff. Not the people we know in the community,

1003
01:21:59,700 --> 01:22:03,700
just regular casual gamers itself.

1004
01:22:03,700 --> 01:22:20,700
I'd just be curious to know. I mean, but that's the thing. This is my other concern. What if that game, heaven forbid, is somebody's first exposure to a dance game? Then they'd never want to play DDR. They'd be all, oh, I played one of those dancing games once. It was stupid.

1005
01:22:20,700 --> 01:22:28,700
Yeah, like I said, something that comes first will always get the fish and people are just going to buy that.

1006
01:22:28,700 --> 01:22:33,180
that I think that's where and when a lot of folks say I'm kind of going on a

1007
01:22:33,180 --> 01:22:36,460
little tangent here but I don't care what a lot of folks say and then back to

1008
01:22:36,460 --> 01:22:41,620
the in the groove not being DDR again we're the addicts that have played the

1009
01:22:41,620 --> 01:22:45,660
dance games for years and years we understand that difference but to say

1010
01:22:45,660 --> 01:22:49,140
that you know well you have all these fighting games and people understand

1011
01:22:49,140 --> 01:22:54,100
that the fighting games are different they all look different these dance

1012
01:22:54,100 --> 01:22:58,820
games kind of look the same sure they have their subtle differences but they

1013
01:22:58,820 --> 01:23:03,520
kind of look the same so to most people they don't see those differences a dance

1014
01:23:03,520 --> 01:23:13,020
game is a dance game so something to think about like if Sonic Sonic came out

1015
01:23:13,020 --> 01:23:16,880
first and you know people gonna jump on that bag of bandwagon because I think

1016
01:23:16,880 --> 01:23:21,820
it's the first I came out then anything else trying to be like it is just a

1017
01:23:21,820 --> 01:23:28,340
a knockoff and nothing to sell. Just like how Madden, I'm just trying to post examples

1018
01:23:28,340 --> 01:23:38,920
here, come on now. That's how I view sports games. Madden, Blitz, they're all football

1019
01:23:38,920 --> 01:23:44,900
games to me. They're interchangeable parts to me. A football game is a football game.

1020
01:23:44,900 --> 01:23:50,980
But now if I were the sports guy, I would be saying, oh, Sky, you're an ignorant motherfucker.

1021
01:23:50,980 --> 01:23:56,140
games are all different like this game's got this license and this game you play

1022
01:23:56,140 --> 01:24:00,460
and then you can play in the street and these different but to me the football

1023
01:24:00,460 --> 01:24:06,860
games they're all the same I played one I played them all maybe I'm just being a

1024
01:24:06,860 --> 01:24:10,580
little too critical with when I think about certain games especially when I

1025
01:24:10,580 --> 01:24:15,340
played practically almost every game there is

1026
01:24:15,340 --> 01:24:18,340
Go to a friend of mine who keeps running games and I play them.

1027
01:24:45,340 --> 01:25:15,260
Oh, do it all night. Do it with me. I'll take you to heaven if you make me feel free.

1028
01:25:15,260 --> 01:25:22,260
Do it tonight, do it alright Just take me and shake me till I burn up inside, aww

1029
01:25:36,260 --> 01:25:40,260
You may have got sex with Sam and Fred and Drizzle Max

1030
01:25:40,260 --> 01:25:43,260
You may be the slave of Tim and Tom and Ed some days

1031
01:25:43,260 --> 01:25:46,760
You may do it again with handsome friends and checking care

1032
01:25:46,760 --> 01:25:50,760
But you're gonna feel so free when you do it with me

1033
01:25:50,760 --> 01:25:53,760
Do it all night, do it with me

1034
01:25:53,760 --> 01:25:56,760
I'll take you to heaven if you make me feel free

1035
01:25:56,760 --> 01:26:00,760
Baby, do it tonight, do it alright

1036
01:26:00,760 --> 01:26:03,760
Just take me and shake me till I burn up inside

1037
01:26:03,760 --> 01:26:07,760
Oh, do it all night, do it with me

1038
01:26:07,760 --> 01:26:10,760
Hard as a fire and as strong as a tree

1039
01:26:10,760 --> 01:26:14,260
Do it tonight, do it alright

1040
01:26:14,260 --> 01:26:17,760
You got it, I knew it, you can do it tonight

1041
01:26:25,760 --> 01:26:28,760
You're the home of the fire, of the straw in the tree

1042
01:26:28,760 --> 01:26:35,760
Come on, do it with me.

1043
01:27:28,760 --> 01:27:30,760
I'm gonna trust me

1044
01:27:30,760 --> 01:27:35,760
I see them, I see them

1045
01:27:35,760 --> 01:27:38,760

More or less, I'll be there

Yuma, Yuma, don't touch me for me

1050
01:27:50,760 --> 01:27:53,760
Ooh-ah, ooh-ah, don't touch me

1051
01:28:23,760 --> 01:28:51,760
This morning, I open my eyes And everything's still the same

1052
01:28:51,760 --> 01:29:00,760
I turned to the guy who was dated last night And now I can watch your lips

1053
01:29:00,760 --> 01:29:07,760
I think it needs to happen more and more I love those men one and all

1054
01:29:07,760 --> 01:29:15,760
Each new one of me makes my heart beat fast When I see them so strong and tall

1055
01:29:45,760 --> 01:29:47,760

that without doing like a four-song erotic break trying to mix up the

1085
01:32:24,060 --> 01:32:27,660
artists a little bit I couldn't think of a four song I'm sure now they'll be

01:32:43,860 --> 01:32:46,940
interact with us if you want more information before we do that though I

1091
01:32:46,940 --> 01:32:51,860
want to talk about Loki's little project. Loki's been working on this project for

1092
01:32:51,860 --> 01:32:57,580
several weeks now and this is exciting to me because he has actually finished

1093
01:32:57,580 --> 01:33:02,100
this project and I've known Loki a while now and he never finishes his projects.

1094
01:33:02,100 --> 01:33:06,460
This is like the first project I've seen him actually finish. So Loki set it up

1095
01:33:06,460 --> 01:33:12,860
for us. What is this you're doing and why, Angel if you'd be so kind, what is this

1096
01:33:12,860 --> 01:33:19,040
you're doing and why I basically made a portable computer that's inside of an

1097
01:33:19,040 --> 01:33:25,040
xbox why I don't know I could have simply bought a laptop for the amount of

1098
01:33:25,040 --> 01:33:28,460
money they spent building this damn thing by the way it's screen caps on

1099
01:33:28,460 --> 01:33:31,380
orange andre dot-com right now if you want to save them that would be lovely

1100
01:33:31,380 --> 01:33:38,860
I'm sure we'd appreciate that yeah cuz I need you know anyways there it is it's

1101
01:33:38,860 --> 01:33:46,460
on the webcam, the orange box. There really looks like, you know, an Xbox. It's all orange.

1102
01:33:46,460 --> 01:33:51,920
How did you build this? What parts went into this? Well, there's a micro-ITX board that's

1103
01:33:51,920 --> 01:33:58,780
inside. It's a very small 15 centimeter by 15 centimeter motherboard. There's a 160 hard

1104
01:33:58,780 --> 01:34:03,960
drive which is going to have wonderful rips of movies and whatnot to take with me because

1105
01:34:03,960 --> 01:34:09,880
it's also going to be used as a media-type computer when I'm done. I'd be hooking up

1106
01:34:09,880 --> 01:34:16,760
to a TV, you know, to play movies off of and whatnot. It's got Windows XP on it right now.

1107
01:34:16,760 --> 01:34:22,280
I have built a portable monitor to go with it, which is on the webcam right now. It's

1108
01:34:22,280 --> 01:34:28,200
actually inside of a metal CD case, and it runs off of batteries if it needs to be, which

1109
01:34:28,200 --> 01:34:33,480
in this case it is running off of battery power right now. Normally, the PC itself actually

1110
01:34:33,480 --> 01:34:38,080
does have a battery however as I'm charging up today it looks like that the

1111
01:34:38,080 --> 01:34:42,800
battery is defective or something and only charged about 75% of the way before

1112
01:34:42,800 --> 01:34:47,840
it said it was full and it's not so I have to send that back so that kind of

1113
01:34:47,840 --> 01:34:53,640
sucks but um everything um it looks really sweet I wish I could open the

1114
01:34:53,640 --> 01:34:59,480
case up for you guys to see it's got a UV fan on the top of it a kind of a like

1115
01:34:59,480 --> 01:35:04,760
a blower. And so, basically the whole thing is just, you know, self-contained in this

1116
01:35:04,760 --> 01:35:12,280
Xbox case right now. It's pretty sweet. It's kind of slow, because micro-ITX PCs are only,

1117
01:35:12,280 --> 01:35:17,480
they're, they have the processor built into the actual motherboard, and it's only one

1118
01:35:17,480 --> 01:35:23,200
gigahertz. So, we're talking a little slow, but, you know, hey, for a portable PC, it's

1119
01:35:23,200 --> 01:35:28,240
not bad. I think it's interesting that the monitor is just one of those PS1 screens.

1120
01:35:28,240 --> 01:35:33,640
It's crazy. How can you see things on that?

1121
01:35:33,640 --> 01:35:34,640
Very carefully.

1122
01:35:34,640 --> 01:35:40,680
It's a five, literally, it's a five inch monitor. And as if those like fifteen inch screens

1123
01:35:40,680 --> 01:35:43,880
weren't bad enough, you are doing computing work on a five inch monitor.

1124
01:35:43,880 --> 01:35:51,400
Well, I have a shortcut on the desktop for the magnifier in case, you know, I can't read

1125
01:35:51,400 --> 01:35:57,120
something. Because, you know, it does get tough. Especially when I set up the graphics

1126
01:35:57,120 --> 01:36:02,560
and stuff. I have the resolution set really low, so I can actually, you know, be able

1127
01:36:02,560 --> 01:36:04,560
to, you know, do stuff with it.

1128
01:36:04,560 --> 01:36:10,080
Yeah, it's a lovely shot of our floor there on the webcam right now, and the massive DVD

1129
01:36:10,080 --> 01:36:14,360
collection there.

1130
01:36:14,360 --> 01:36:16,320
And so, yeah, the lowest I could go...

1131
01:36:16,320 --> 01:36:17,960
I'm sorry, so was it, what do you want?

1132
01:36:17,960 --> 01:36:21,000
Was the resolution by 320 by 240?

1133
01:36:21,000 --> 01:36:22,280
I don't think you can go that low, can you?

1134
01:36:22,280 --> 01:36:27,280
It is a pro-PS screen, I'm not sure if it can go by...

1135
01:36:27,280 --> 01:36:37,280
No, it's really actually, to be honest, because I have it 640x480 and I adjusted all the fonts so they're huge, I can actually read it pretty well.

1136
01:36:37,280 --> 01:36:43,100
icon you know the icons you can read what they you know say on it and

1137
01:36:43,100 --> 01:36:49,140
everything and it's not that hard to read and like I said I have the

1138
01:36:49,140 --> 01:36:54,680
magnifier you know macro or not really macro but a shortcut to the magnifier

1139
01:36:54,680 --> 01:36:58,520
and if I can't read anything you just move it over there and you can actually

1140
01:36:58,520 --> 01:37:02,240
read it there's a little like window at the top that magnifies everything really

1141
01:37:02,240 --> 01:37:06,980
big so you can actually see it but this monitor I mean not only will it output

1142
01:37:06,980 --> 01:37:12,220
it'll output to anything that takes the TV out, you know, or TV in. So I can hook this

1143
01:37:12,220 --> 01:37:16,900
up to the TV and that's, you know, we won't have any problems seeing the picture. This

1144
01:37:16,900 --> 01:37:24,380
is just for, you know, to make it sure portable, which I hope to take it with me, the E3. That

1145
01:37:24,380 --> 01:37:29,040
was the whole purpose of building it in the first place. Now, if I can only get that goddamn

1146
01:37:29,040 --> 01:37:34,600
battery to work. Yeah. I just think it's so crazy you took an Xbox. Why did you decide

1147
01:37:34,600 --> 01:37:36,500
to put a computer inside an Xbox.

1148
01:37:36,500 --> 01:37:44,500
Because honestly, I thought about first doing a Dreamcast, too small, and the Xbox being

1149
01:37:44,500 --> 01:37:47,700
the largest console system that I can think of.

1150
01:37:47,700 --> 01:37:51,900
Well you know what's funny is that, I don't know, have you shown like an above shot of

1151
01:37:51,900 --> 01:37:53,900
it where they can see the fan?

1152
01:37:53,900 --> 01:37:57,900
Because it's so funny because you actually drilled out that little Xbox logo that's in

1153
01:37:57,900 --> 01:38:02,060
the center of an Xbox, and that's where you put the fan, and I find that so hilarious,

1154
01:38:02,060 --> 01:38:04,440
I don't know why I'm so easily amused by that.

1155
01:38:04,440 --> 01:38:08,120
but the way you laid everything out is so funny. Plus, I think it's funny, you were

1156
01:38:08,120 --> 01:38:13,120
telling me about how you were holding some of the stuff in. You were, literally parts

1157
01:38:13,120 --> 01:38:17,880
of this computer are being held together, oh that's a nice shot right there on the webcam.

1158
01:38:17,880 --> 01:38:20,880
Literally parts of this are being held together by duct tape and zip ties.

1159
01:38:20,880 --> 01:38:27,240
No, not duct tape. Zip ties for the most part. The hard drive is being held in by zip ties

1160
01:38:27,240 --> 01:38:31,560
because the way it had to be mounted, I couldn't mount it on the bottom because I didn't have

1161
01:38:31,560 --> 01:38:36,600
the right screws for it. So I actually mounted it with zip ties, and that sucker ain't movin'.

1162
01:38:36,600 --> 01:38:43,220
So, um, that's pretty good. Um, the CD-ROM is actually being held in there, not by duct

1163
01:38:43,220 --> 01:38:49,360
tape, but it's just double-stick tape that, you know, has a five-pound, um, weight limit

1164
01:38:49,360 --> 01:38:54,280
on it, so the CD-ROM's fine. And it's this little laptop, I actually have a laptop CD

1165
01:38:54,280 --> 01:38:59,620
burner in here. Wow. See, for... You actually have a drive, I didn't realize you had a drive

1166
01:38:59,620 --> 01:39:06,620
in there. Why the hell did you fit that? There's a CD burner in there that actually fits in

1167
01:39:06,620 --> 01:39:12,520
there right where the normal drive would be. That is crazy! The only problem is, lately

1168
01:39:12,520 --> 01:39:17,380
it's been sticking, so I gotta figure out why that is, but that barely fit in there.

1169
01:39:17,380 --> 01:39:22,220
With the fan in there, it's literally pressed up right against the fan. Now, Dark Knight

1170
01:39:22,220 --> 01:39:26,980
says, if Bill Gates were to see that, Loki would be so toast right now. It's running

1171
01:39:26,980 --> 01:39:32,740
Microsoft Windows. It's not like I put Linux in it.

1172
01:39:32,740 --> 01:39:36,400
Yeah, can you install Linux on it? Because God knows they'll install Linux on anything

1173
01:39:36,400 --> 01:39:43,600
they can. I think it's quite a little complicated. But you didn't go out and buy an Xbox and

1174
01:39:43,600 --> 01:39:47,640
gut it. No, I bought a case online. On eBay.

1175
01:39:47,640 --> 01:39:53,160
Not on eBay. There's an actual website that sells case mods and stuff so you can buy clear

1176
01:39:53,160 --> 01:39:55,900
clear cases. I should have bought a clear case, that would have been cool, but they

1177
01:39:55,900 --> 01:40:03,240
were like $30 more, so I was like, ask for it. So, I bought a case, and the hard drive,

1178
01:40:03,240 --> 01:40:10,240
everything's mounted on my own. I had to make and drill mounts for the motherboard. I had

1179
01:40:10,240 --> 01:40:16,600
to dremel the hell out of this. I want to move it so I can show the other side here,

1180
01:40:16,600 --> 01:40:21,320
But I'm afraid that I'm going to knock the power thing out again.

1181
01:40:21,320 --> 01:40:27,760
But anyways, yeah, unlike most PCs where you have all your ports on the back of the PC,

1182
01:40:27,760 --> 01:40:33,080
this has all the ports on the side of the Xbox, so it'd be on the left-hand side, and

1183
01:40:33,080 --> 01:40:38,920
I unfortunately cannot reach the camera over there to see that, but trust me, they're there.

1184
01:40:38,920 --> 01:40:40,600
And then the power's in the back.

1185
01:40:40,600 --> 01:40:44,620
The power right now was being held on by hot glue, however that fell off, so it's being

1186
01:40:44,620 --> 01:40:52,220
held on by a wire right now. That's just temporary until I get some super glue to put that on

1187
01:40:52,220 --> 01:40:53,220
there.

1188
01:40:53,220 --> 01:40:55,140
No, I thought the original idea for this is that it was going to be something you were

1189
01:40:55,140 --> 01:40:58,980
going to like have in a backpack or something and carry around with you. I guess that idea

1190
01:40:58,980 --> 01:40:59,980
is kind of out the window at this point.

1191
01:40:59,980 --> 01:41:05,620
Uh, that idea, that, no, what the hell. There's, to buy stuff to make your own, like, wearable

1192
01:41:05,620 --> 01:41:07,460
PC is way too expensive.

1193
01:41:07,460 --> 01:41:10,900
Because I was just thinking, my God, with a fan on the top like that, that's kind of

1194
01:41:10,900 --> 01:41:13,180
dangerous, in a way, if you're not careful.

1195
01:41:13,180 --> 01:41:17,460
Well, I'm going to have a grill over it, so that's not going to be a problem.

1196
01:41:17,460 --> 01:41:19,700
Yeah, right now, though, it doesn't have a grill over it.

1197
01:41:19,700 --> 01:41:23,020
That's the cool thing about this, though, is with the fan being right over,

1198
01:41:23,020 --> 01:41:31,980
where the fan is located is right on top of the RAM and the north and south bridge on the motherboard,

1199
01:41:31,980 --> 01:41:36,220
you know, the two main chips that they have on there to do all the processing.

1200
01:41:36,220 --> 01:41:40,740
And then slightly diagonal of that is the processor,

1201
01:41:40,740 --> 01:41:45,700
So all of the heat that's generally off of that is just shot out of the top like nothing.

1202
01:41:45,700 --> 01:41:49,940
So this PC will not overheat at all, which is awesome.

1203
01:41:49,940 --> 01:41:53,260
And then the hard drive is pretty large.

1204
01:41:53,260 --> 01:41:58,380
It takes about half the Xbox case itself, and that has its own fan as well.

1205
01:41:58,380 --> 01:42:01,580
I actually used the Xbox fan that was built into the case.

1206
01:42:01,580 --> 01:42:02,660
Wow.

1207
01:42:02,660 --> 01:42:05,760
Now, they're saying in the chatroom, Dark Knight says it would have been awesome

1208
01:42:05,760 --> 01:42:09,100
if the Xbox boot-up screen followed by the Windows boot-up music,

1209
01:42:09,100 --> 01:42:13,820
but you actually took the Xbox boot-up screen and that's your background on the PC, right?

1210
01:42:13,820 --> 01:42:19,500
That is the background. Um, I can't get a very good shot at the picture right now, but, um,

1211
01:42:19,500 --> 01:42:24,460
yeah, it says, uh, I'll, maybe I'll see if we can get in here, uh,

1212
01:42:24,460 --> 01:42:28,940
well anyways, it says the Orange Box PC created by Loki. I'll post the pictures

1213
01:42:28,940 --> 01:42:33,340
of that scene later, but, um, yeah, that, it is the actual, um,

1214
01:42:33,340 --> 01:42:36,620
screen there, and I have a theme kinda going with it.

1215
01:42:36,620 --> 01:42:42,120
This case that's in right now, um, actually, I'm gonna just probably just unplug this real quick.

1216
01:42:42,120 --> 01:42:46,120
Are there a lot of people out there that have done this? Turned their Xboxes and gutted them and done PCs?

1217
01:42:46,120 --> 01:42:55,120
There's, um, a few people that have, um, I've seen one that they've actually shoved a GameCube inside of an Xbox, as well as an Xbox.

1218
01:42:55,120 --> 01:42:56,120
Interesting.

1219
01:42:56,120 --> 01:43:12,120
Then I've seen people that have actually taken the whole Xbox stuff out, put it in a PC case with a Playstation 2, and also pretty much all the game systems all in one, which is kind of retarded, but whatever.

1220
01:43:12,120 --> 01:43:21,120
And I've got to paint the case still for the modern orange as well to match the rest, but that's optional of course.

1221
01:43:21,120 --> 01:43:27,120
Interesting. Alright, well thanks for sharing. Maybe we can get some clearer picks and put them up on our website, because we don't really use our...

1222
01:43:27,120 --> 01:43:29,120
I can use the campaign for anything.

1223
01:43:29,120 --> 01:43:30,120
We'll figure something out.

1224
01:43:30,120 --> 01:43:31,120
Alright, we'll figure something out.

1225
01:43:31,120 --> 01:43:35,120
Alright, anyway, we are going to open up the Skype line for some feedback, if you guys want to call in.

1226
01:43:35,120 --> 01:43:39,120
If you want to talk about the Xbox PC, if you have any questions for Loki on that.

1227
01:43:39,120 --> 01:43:45,120
Or, of course, we're willing to talk to you guys for a little bit about the Pump It Up news, about the DDR news, all that stuff.

1228
01:43:45,120 --> 01:43:51,740
stuff, call in right now, www.orangelaundraider.com, click on the interact with us link for more

1229
01:43:51,740 --> 01:43:54,560
information about how to get a hold of us through the Skype line.

1230
01:43:54,560 --> 01:43:57,840
Meanwhile while we wait for that, because it takes a minute for the buffer to hit, say

1231
01:43:57,840 --> 01:44:00,520
hello to Bugd, who just joined us in the studio.

1232
01:44:00,520 --> 01:44:02,240
Hello to Bugd, who just joined us in the studio.

1233
01:44:02,240 --> 01:44:03,240
How you doing, sir?

1234
01:44:03,240 --> 01:44:04,240
Uh, naked hot tubbing, actually.

1235
01:44:04,240 --> 01:44:05,240
What?

1236
01:44:05,240 --> 01:44:06,240
Yeah, that was yesterday.

1237
01:44:06,240 --> 01:44:09,480
I went down to San Jose and did some naked hot tubbing.

1238
01:44:09,480 --> 01:44:14,200
Close your mouth, you're tracking flies.

1239
01:44:14,200 --> 01:44:16,200
Run that by me again. Why?

1240
01:44:16,200 --> 01:44:17,200
Why the hell not?

1241
01:44:19,200 --> 01:44:20,200
Okay, whatever.

1242
01:44:20,200 --> 01:44:21,200
There was a hot tub?

1243
01:44:22,200 --> 01:44:23,200
I don't know. I don't know how to follow that up.

1244
01:44:23,200 --> 01:44:24,200
Alright, let's go.

1245
01:44:24,200 --> 01:44:26,200
Thank God we have somebody on the Skype line.

1246
01:44:26,200 --> 01:44:27,200
Hi, you're on Orange Sounds Radio.

1247
01:44:29,200 --> 01:44:30,200
Legend of Zaku here.

1248
01:44:30,200 --> 01:44:32,200
Hello. Hello, Legend of Zaku.

1249
01:44:32,200 --> 01:44:34,200
You're a little bit choppy tonight. What's up?

1250
01:44:38,200 --> 01:44:39,200
Let me see.

1251
01:44:39,200 --> 01:44:41,200
Yeah, the choppiness of my school's connection.

1252
01:44:41,200 --> 01:44:46,560
connection, IRC basically kicking me out, you know, basically dying on me a few times,

1253
01:44:46,560 --> 01:44:50,080
that's why they use a new program for IRC now.

1254
01:44:50,080 --> 01:44:52,480
Well, life sucks, what's on your mind?

1255
01:44:54,560 --> 01:45:00,400
Let me see, all this jive about people just, you know, being so pessimistic about, you know,

1256
01:45:00,400 --> 01:45:04,960
can I make another mix, another arcade mix, that's just really, I don't know, that's kind

1257
01:45:04,960 --> 01:45:10,640
of getting to me personally. You're just upset that people are pretty much writing it off and

1258
01:45:10,640 --> 01:45:12,640
and people are saying it's never gonna happen?

1259
01:45:12,640 --> 01:45:17,140
They're doubters. I mean, they're basically pessimistic as we speak.

1260
01:45:17,140 --> 01:45:20,640
I'm not saying any names, but that's the mood I'm sensing right now.

1261
01:45:20,640 --> 01:45:26,440
Well, you can't say that there's for sure never gonna be another Konami arcade mix,

1262
01:45:26,440 --> 01:45:28,840
because there is one coming out in Europe. We know that much.

1263
01:45:28,840 --> 01:45:37,040
Yes. If it does good, then, you know, Konami can rethink their plans of, you know, bringing it stateside.

1264
01:45:37,040 --> 01:45:46,040
Is it possible there will be a new arcade mix? I say yes, but I just, I don't think we really know at this point what's going to happen.

1265
01:45:46,040 --> 01:45:51,040
If it's going to happen, you know, tomorrow, if it's going to happen in the next, you know, couple of years, or what?

1266
01:45:51,040 --> 01:45:53,040
And if this is a life-turning event for you?

1267
01:45:53,040 --> 01:46:02,040
Well, no. No, but at the same time, it's kind of sad that, you know, DDR introduced me to all these people,

1268
01:46:02,040 --> 01:46:06,480
and you know it gave me an idea for a radio show that you know we've been

1269
01:46:06,480 --> 01:46:09,560
doing for the past few years and everything it's just kind of sad that

1270
01:46:09,560 --> 01:46:14,360
DDR you know helped with all that and now the game is not happening and that's

1271
01:46:14,360 --> 01:46:17,280
why people are so passionate about it. It's because people have been sucking

1272
01:46:17,280 --> 01:46:22,520
down on Xtreme for about two years now. I agree that it's good that the longer it

1273
01:46:22,520 --> 01:46:27,320
goes on the more that the other games like In The Groove and Pump It Up are

1274
01:46:27,320 --> 01:46:33,400
gonna catch on so I agree the Konami shooting themselves in the foot but what

1275
01:46:33,400 --> 01:46:43,560
can you do what what the hell I know I don't know what that noise was either but

1276
01:46:43,560 --> 01:46:50,800
that's right um well you know I I don't you know as far as the petitions and

1277
01:46:50,800 --> 01:46:55,640
things go that's all nice and dandy but I think it really sits in Konami of

1278
01:46:55,640 --> 01:46:58,760
Japan's court and we're all basically their bitches right now until they make

1279
01:46:58,760 --> 01:47:09,080
a decision well yeah but yes we do and he's but he you have to remember he's

1280
01:47:09,080 --> 01:47:14,360
with Konami of America and as far as the American home versions are going they're

1281
01:47:14,360 --> 01:47:21,980
freakin fabulous ultra mix 2 was a fabulous mix and a DDR 3 more fabulous

1282
01:47:21,980 --> 01:47:31,060
A DDR Extreme, despite all the crap DDR Extreme got from some people, they tried something

1283
01:47:31,060 --> 01:47:35,940
different, they tried a lot of new things, and for the most part it was pretty cool.

1284
01:47:35,940 --> 01:47:38,500
And for the casual player, it was very cool.

1285
01:47:38,500 --> 01:47:42,920
So as far as DDR home stuff in America, they're really not doing anything wrong.

1286
01:47:42,920 --> 01:47:44,380
They're doing everything right.

1287
01:47:44,380 --> 01:47:46,620
So you can't fault them.

1288
01:47:46,620 --> 01:47:48,620
So I don't know.

1289
01:47:48,620 --> 01:48:10,620
I know, I can accept that, but you know, come on now. Two weeks without a mix, there has to be something done. Anything. I don't care if you just make at least a faint action of just starting to make one. I would care as long as I know that you guys are thinking of something.

1290
01:48:10,620 --> 01:48:22,620
Well, hopefully they'll give us a clue at some point, but anyway, Zaku, we're going to let you go because there's a bunch of people trying to get in, and you're kind of fading out anyway, so I've got to let you go, buddy, but have a good one. Thanks for calling. Later.

1291
01:48:22,620 --> 01:48:26,620
Alright, let's pick up this one. Hi, you're on Orange Lawn's radio.

1292
01:48:26,620 --> 01:48:28,620
Hey, Sky, it's Elmoet again.

1293
01:48:28,620 --> 01:48:30,620
Hello, Elmoet, what's on your mind?

1294
01:48:30,620 --> 01:48:37,620
Well, basically, Legend of Zaku was talking about how he wasn't going to name names while I was the other half of that argument.

1295
01:48:37,620 --> 01:48:40,620
Okay, alright, so you want to give us the other half of the story here then?

1296
01:48:40,620 --> 01:48:48,620
Well basically, all my other half was, is that I'm sure Konami would love to release another arcade mix here in the States,

1297
01:48:48,620 --> 01:48:54,620
but then again, they're going to have to look at how profitable is it going to be for them at this point in time.

1298
01:48:57,620 --> 01:49:01,620
I would think it's profitable, personally, but I don't know.

1299
01:49:01,620 --> 01:49:06,980
I mean I don't have, I have a skewed perspective and I think we all do as DDR addicts, we think

1300
01:49:06,980 --> 01:49:11,220
our game is perfect and it's making Konami tons of money and we don't really know.

1301
01:49:11,220 --> 01:49:17,300
But when I see the imitators doing well, such as Pump It Up is doing so well that now they're

1302
01:49:17,300 --> 01:49:25,740
going to do a home release, it kind of makes me go, hmm, if the imitators are doing well...

1303
01:49:25,740 --> 01:49:31,380
That's true, but now that the imitators are moving to the home markets, I'm hoping that

1304
01:49:31,380 --> 01:49:35,900
But this news about PuppetUp being released on a console in the U.S. is a huge wake-up

1305
01:49:35,900 --> 01:49:36,900
call.

1306
01:49:36,900 --> 01:49:41,500
But then again, the U.S. console scene is not where Konami needs a wake-up call.

1307
01:49:41,500 --> 01:49:45,100
Because they're, as I said in the last call, they're doing everything right, as far as

1308
01:49:45,100 --> 01:49:46,100
I'm concerned.

1309
01:49:46,100 --> 01:49:47,100
So...

1310
01:49:47,100 --> 01:49:48,100
That's true.

1311
01:49:48,100 --> 01:49:49,100
That's true.

1312
01:49:49,100 --> 01:49:50,100
They're not the ones that need the wake-up call.

1313
01:49:50,100 --> 01:49:52,100
They should go out and release this to Japan.

1314
01:49:52,100 --> 01:49:53,100
Right.

1315
01:49:53,100 --> 01:49:54,100
I mean...

1316
01:49:54,100 --> 01:49:55,100
The one thing that really...

1317
01:49:55,100 --> 01:49:56,100
Which I guess they've done already.

1318
01:49:56,100 --> 01:49:57,100
But...

1319
01:49:57,100 --> 01:49:58,100
Yeah, most likely.

1320
01:49:58,100 --> 01:50:01,740
Just the one thing that really gets me is that people are

1321
01:50:01,740 --> 01:50:06,380
bitching and moaning, the U.S. needs a new arcade mix, when there hasn't been a new

1322
01:50:06,380 --> 01:50:09,640
U.S. arcade mix in years.

1323
01:50:09,640 --> 01:50:13,900
Well, that's a very good point, is people often confuse these

1324
01:50:13,900 --> 01:50:18,620
Japanese releases that get imported as U.S. releases.

1325
01:50:18,620 --> 01:50:20,180
Not only that, but

1326
01:50:20,180 --> 01:50:25,140
we kind of shot our own selves in the foot as far as U.S. arcade games go,

1327
01:50:25,140 --> 01:50:33,340
Because when DDR USA was released, the arcade version, it seemed more people wanted to play

1328
01:50:33,340 --> 01:50:34,340
the imports.

1329
01:50:34,340 --> 01:50:37,060
They wanted to play the ones with the 50, the 80, the 100 song.

1330
01:50:37,060 --> 01:50:42,340
Well because DDR USA for the most part was crap, and so was the first home release, when

1331
01:50:42,340 --> 01:50:43,700
you put it side by side with the import.

1332
01:50:43,700 --> 01:50:50,140
But now, I trust Konami of America way more now than I would have back then.

1333
01:50:50,140 --> 01:50:53,060
Because I would think that if they put out an arcade, like I said, I said this when Ultra

1334
01:50:53,060 --> 01:50:57,900
Mix 2 first came out. Make Konami of Hawaii do the next arcade mix. We'll all want to

1335
01:50:57,900 --> 01:51:04,460
have sex with it. It'll be beautiful. Look up with a different drum again. It'll be a

1336
01:51:04,460 --> 01:51:07,020
beautiful mix. Nobody's going to complain.

1337
01:51:07,020 --> 01:51:11,980
I agree 100% with you there, Sky. Anyway, moving off of this subject, the reason why

1338
01:51:11,980 --> 01:51:17,960
I wanted to call was because of the new PIU North American release.

1339
01:51:17,960 --> 01:51:20,600
Sometimes I'd just like to take the I out and call it P.U.

1340
01:51:22,040 --> 01:51:24,040
Never mind. Anyway, sorry, yes, all right.

1341
01:51:24,040 --> 01:51:24,540
You're funny.

1342
01:51:24,540 --> 01:51:25,280
Yeah, I know.

1343
01:51:25,280 --> 01:51:27,100
Who said there wasn't any comedy on this show?

1344
01:51:27,100 --> 01:51:28,000
They don't pay me to be funny.

1345
01:51:28,000 --> 01:51:28,500
Uh...

1346
01:51:28,500 --> 01:51:29,640
I just got here.

1347
01:51:29,640 --> 01:51:30,140
Pup...

1348
01:51:30,140 --> 01:51:30,640
Pup...

1349
01:51:30,880 --> 01:51:31,380
Yes, Bug?

1350
01:51:31,380 --> 01:51:32,040
I-I just got here.

1351
01:51:32,040 --> 01:51:32,540
Whatever.

1352
01:51:32,540 --> 01:51:33,280
There's been no comedy.

1353
01:51:33,280 --> 01:51:33,780
Uh...

1354
01:51:34,480 --> 01:51:35,840
Pump it up in the U.S. What'd you wanna say?

1355
01:51:36,540 --> 01:51:40,380
I wanted to say that I am a very happy person for them doing this.

1356
01:51:41,320 --> 01:51:46,260
And I'm looking at the song list and it looks to be a very, very tough package to beat.

1357
01:51:46,260 --> 01:51:51,740
there's a song list for the u.s. well yeah if you check down in the DDR freak

1358
01:51:51,740 --> 01:51:56,180
thread if you check down like very low in the second post they've already

1359
01:51:56,180 --> 01:52:03,140
released a song list it's going to be very heavily influenced by the Korean

1360
01:52:03,140 --> 01:52:11,100
version the Korean home version it's going to be 85 songs tons of Banya

1361
01:52:11,100 --> 01:52:14,500
There's gonna be tons of kpop surprise tons of Banya

1362
01:52:16,260 --> 01:52:22,940
But there's going to be lots of kpop I'm there's there's you've heard that there's going to be some exclusive American content

1363
01:52:23,300 --> 01:52:28,260
Okay, the kpop dwarfs that by like five or six times

1364
01:52:29,020 --> 01:52:34,780
Interesting. I I'm still is it you're saying the song list is on page two of that thread is what you said page two

1365
01:52:34,780 --> 01:52:39,820
Oh, there it is. I see it. Okay. Never mind. I got it. I see it. Ooh, we get starry on that's hot

1366
01:52:39,820 --> 01:52:41,820
Yeah, definitely. That's an obvious one. That's been...

1367
01:52:41,820 --> 01:52:43,820
Yeah, I know, but that song is so hot.

1368
01:52:43,820 --> 01:52:45,820
NXT, NXT 2...

1369
01:52:47,820 --> 01:52:49,820
Crystal Method, name of the game.

1370
01:52:49,820 --> 01:52:54,820
Wasn't somebody... Somebody was saying that that song needed to be in a dance game for like the longest time.

1371
01:52:54,820 --> 01:53:00,820
Was it you? I'm thinking Lanky style said it, but maybe it was you, Logy. I don't know.

1372
01:53:00,820 --> 01:53:05,820
That's hot. Elvis, Little Less Conversation, which is funny, that's a DDR song.

1373
01:53:05,820 --> 01:53:11,220
Let's Groove, not the DDR version, but the original Earth Wind Fire.

1374
01:53:11,220 --> 01:53:13,420
And Rapper's Delight, Sugarhill Gang.

1375
01:53:13,420 --> 01:53:14,780
What the hell?

1376
01:53:14,780 --> 01:53:17,060
Hey, that's kinda hot.

1377
01:53:17,060 --> 01:53:19,940
They're borrowing a lot from Dancing Stage, I can see.

1378
01:53:19,940 --> 01:53:21,460
Interesting.

1379
01:53:21,460 --> 01:53:24,260
Seems to be interesting.

1380
01:53:24,260 --> 01:53:27,020
And then like just a whole shitload of Banya songs.

1381
01:53:27,020 --> 01:53:29,420
Yeah, I've also noticed that

1382
01:53:29,420 --> 01:53:32,980
we have about fifteen songs less so far

1383
01:53:32,980 --> 01:53:34,700
than the

1384
01:53:34,700 --> 01:53:38,640
Korean version and I think that's a pretty good move because it seemed like

1385
01:53:38,640 --> 01:53:40,240
in the Korean song list

1386
01:53:40,240 --> 01:53:43,960
they put all of their good stuff on one disc

1387
01:53:43,960 --> 01:53:48,380
and I don't like that. If I see all their good stuff in one game

1388
01:53:48,380 --> 01:53:51,800
it doesn't mean that, it probably means that they're not going to have a hell of

1389
01:53:51,800 --> 01:53:54,880
a lot of good stuff for the sequel.

1390
01:53:54,880 --> 01:53:58,000
My only concern with buying this game at this point is that I don't want to spend

1391
01:53:58,000 --> 01:53:59,140
the money on the other pad.

1392
01:53:59,140 --> 01:54:02,560
So this game better be well priced.

1393
01:54:02,560 --> 01:54:10,560
But they say this is going to be bundled with a pad, so at least there's that.

1394
01:54:10,560 --> 01:54:12,560
Well, I'm willing to check it out.

1395
01:54:12,560 --> 01:54:16,560
I'm just happy that I get to play Turkey March at home.

1396
01:54:16,560 --> 01:54:19,560
I'm not that fickle!

1397
01:54:19,560 --> 01:54:22,560
For DDR, it's Moonlight Shadow.

1398
01:54:22,560 --> 01:54:24,560
And, to a lesser extent, Un Deux Trois.

1399
01:54:24,560 --> 01:54:27,560
For Pump It Up, it's Turkey March.

1400
01:54:27,560 --> 01:54:37,560
You know what, and for me, it's Funky Tonight. I love that song. And Starry On. So I'm thrilled as hell about this mix. So that's cool.

1401
01:54:37,560 --> 01:54:41,560
Thank you for letting, thank you for giving us a heads up to the song list there. I appreciate that.

1402
01:54:41,560 --> 01:54:42,560
No problem.

1403
01:54:42,560 --> 01:54:45,560
Alright, we gotta let you go on Mullet, but I'll let you work in a quick plug.

1404
01:54:45,560 --> 01:54:49,560
www.insidepulse.com again.

1405
01:54:49,560 --> 01:54:51,560
Visit it. Love it. Read us column.

1406
01:54:51,560 --> 01:54:52,560
Exactly.

1407
01:54:52,560 --> 01:54:54,560
Alright, have a good one. Bye bye.

1408
01:54:54,560 --> 01:54:58,560
I'm all happy about Pump It Up now. That's pretty good.

1409
01:54:58,560 --> 01:55:02,560
That is a way better song list than what I was expecting.

1410
01:55:02,560 --> 01:55:06,560
Yeah, I agree too. I would read it all for you guys, but there's a lot to it.

1411
01:55:06,560 --> 01:55:10,560
But basically, all those big Pump songs you guys know about, they're in there.

1412
01:55:10,560 --> 01:55:14,560
Actually, I didn't see if Run To You was in there, but somebody in the chat won't tell me.

1413
01:55:14,560 --> 01:55:18,560
I don't think so, because they took out the license for Run To You in C2,

1414
01:55:18,560 --> 01:55:23,560
and they've probably been taking out the new license from DJ Doc itself.

1415
01:55:23,560 --> 01:55:26,560
Maybe, I don't know, we'll see. Somebody in chat room will tell me, I don't know.

1416
01:55:26,560 --> 01:55:27,560
We'll see what's up.

1417
01:55:27,560 --> 01:55:33,560
Alright, um, why don't we get to the cage match? I will open up the skype line again a little bit later and show if you guys are interested in calling in,

1418
01:55:33,560 --> 01:55:40,560
but for right now we're going to get into the Orange Lounge Radio cage match because we're running a little bit behind in show right now.

1419
01:55:40,560 --> 01:55:45,560
So remember guys, if you want to participate in the cage match, you have to be in our chat room.

1420
01:55:45,560 --> 01:55:49,560
www.orangeloungeradio.com

1421
01:55:49,560 --> 01:55:52,560
and click on Chat

1422
01:55:52,560 --> 01:55:55,560
and we're going to move into the Cage Match.

1423
01:55:55,560 --> 01:55:58,560
The way the Orange Lounge Radio Cage Match works

1424
01:55:58,560 --> 01:56:00,560
we play three songs for you guys.

1425
01:56:00,560 --> 01:56:02,560
You guys vote on your favorite

1426
01:56:02,560 --> 01:56:05,560
and the winning song goes into rotation all week long

1427
01:56:05,560 --> 01:56:07,560
on Orange Lounge Radio's 24-7

1428
01:56:07,560 --> 01:56:09,560
Bomani Music and More program.

1429
01:56:09,560 --> 01:56:12,560
Last week in the Orange Lounge Cage Match

1430
01:56:12,560 --> 01:56:15,560
Freezepoop, I'm sorry, Freezepop won.

1431
01:56:17,560 --> 01:56:19,560
You have to hear all their songs, you need to get that joke.

1432
01:56:19,560 --> 01:56:25,560
Freezepop, a favorite band of ours from Amplitude and Frequency and Boston,

1433
01:56:25,560 --> 01:56:28,560
won with their song called Stakeout.

1434
01:56:31,560 --> 01:56:36,560
Alright, well we'll see, will Loki be happy and Freezepop will be voted out tonight,

1435
01:56:36,560 --> 01:56:39,560
or will I be happy and this song stays in for another week?

1436
01:56:39,560 --> 01:56:41,560
We will find out, it's in your hands you guys.

1437
01:56:41,560 --> 01:56:45,060
Here's a clip, because you only get to hear a clip, because it won last week.

1438
01:56:45,060 --> 01:56:48,860
Remember, you can't vote until all three songs have played. Here's a clip of song number one,

1439
01:56:48,860 --> 01:56:49,900
last week's winner,

1440
01:56:49,900 --> 01:56:56,900
freeze-pop stakeout

1441
01:57:19,900 --> 01:57:21,900
I'm on a stakeout

1442
01:57:36,900 --> 01:57:39,900
I've got a plan in mind for you, I'm waiting till the time is right

1443
01:57:39,900 --> 01:57:42,900
I know that you like what I do, no need to put up a fight

1444
01:57:42,900 --> 01:57:45,900
Watching you from far away, you look so sweet and clueless

1445
01:57:45,900 --> 01:57:49,900
Soon I'll move in on my prey, it's time for me to do this

1446
01:58:02,900 --> 01:58:08,900
Watching and waiting, the feeling is elating

1447
01:58:08,900 --> 01:58:10,900
I need my time

1448
01:58:12,900 --> 01:58:16,900
Yeah, I know that you'll soon be mine

1449
01:58:20,900 --> 01:58:22,900
Soon be mine

1450
01:58:24,900 --> 01:58:26,900
Can't let you see me

1451
01:58:26,900 --> 01:58:28,900
Can't let you see me

1452
01:58:28,900 --> 01:58:30,900
Can't let you see me

1453
01:58:30,900 --> 01:58:32,900
I'm on a shakeout

1454
01:58:32,900 --> 01:58:34,900
Shaking and wasting

1455
01:58:34,900 --> 01:58:36,900
I'm on a shakeout

1456
01:58:36,900 --> 01:59:02,180
All right, song number one, a clip of last week's winner, Freezepop with Stakeout.

1457
01:59:02,180 --> 01:59:05,740
Let's get into song number two, which is brought to us by Loki.

1458
01:59:05,740 --> 01:59:10,380
Earth to Loki, what did you pick tonight?

1459
01:59:10,380 --> 01:59:15,160
I picked this song by a group that sounds just like Echo Image, and they also have

1460
01:59:15,160 --> 01:59:19,220
their group name is almost like Echo Image, it's Echoing Green.

1461
01:59:19,220 --> 01:59:21,100
Okay.

1462
01:59:21,100 --> 01:59:22,980
And this is the time of my life.

1463
01:59:22,980 --> 01:59:27,780
Actually, it's the story of our lives. Whatever, story of our lives, time of my life, close enough.

1464
01:59:27,780 --> 01:59:32,340
The story of our lives. Any reason you wanted to pick this?

1465
01:59:32,340 --> 01:59:34,380
It just, I don't know, it reminded me of Echo Image.

1466
01:59:34,380 --> 01:59:39,380
Alright, here it is, song number two, Loki's Pick, Echoing Green, Story of Our Lives.

1467
02:00:04,380 --> 02:00:16,380
So we take our hopes and hold them away We'll change them to the notes of yesterday

1468
02:00:16,380 --> 02:00:21,380
The chains of getting died

1469
02:00:21,380 --> 02:00:27,380
Tonight, our dreams are in our sight

1470
02:00:27,380 --> 02:00:31,380
Just when lifted out of nowhere

1471
02:00:31,380 --> 02:00:34,380
With sunspots in our eyes

1472
02:00:34,380 --> 02:00:38,380
We see the glory of our lives

1473
02:00:38,380 --> 02:00:42,380
Our hearts are burning bright

1474
02:00:42,380 --> 02:00:46,380
Just when lifted out of nowhere

1475
02:00:46,380 --> 02:00:49,380
Our songs all stay behind

1476
02:00:49,380 --> 02:00:53,380
To sing the story of our lives

1477
02:01:06,380 --> 02:01:08,380
In this place

1478
02:01:09,380 --> 02:01:12,380
Loneliness is never-ending

1479
02:01:13,380 --> 02:01:15,380
Consenting

1480
02:01:15,380 --> 02:01:19,380
We reached a bitter taste

1481
02:01:19,380 --> 02:01:25,380
For now, the heart's way down with nothing

1482
02:01:25,380 --> 02:01:30,380
Darkness gives our innocence away

1483
02:01:30,380 --> 02:01:35,380
But now we're seeking light

1484
02:01:35,380 --> 02:01:41,380
Tonight, our dreams are in our sight

1485
02:01:41,380 --> 02:01:48,380
Cause when they're still not knowin' When the sun shines in our eyes

1486
02:01:48,380 --> 02:01:56,380
We see the glory of our lives Our hearts are burning bright

1487
02:01:56,380 --> 02:02:03,380
Cause when they're still not knowin' Our songs all stay behind

1488
02:02:03,380 --> 02:02:07,380
But to sing the story of our lives

1489
02:02:11,380 --> 02:02:14,380
The story of our lives

1490
02:02:44,380 --> 02:03:03,380
She comes first as the moon She melts in my throat yesterday

1491
02:03:03,380 --> 02:03:10,380
She's not getting tied to a knife

1492
02:03:25,380 --> 02:03:28,380
Our dreams are in our sights

1493
02:03:28,380 --> 02:03:40,380
Cause when the sun shines in our eyes We see the glory of our lives

1494
02:03:40,380 --> 02:03:47,380
Our hearts are burning bright Cause when the sun shines in our eyes

1495
02:03:47,380 --> 02:03:57,380
The pain of love we find, we hold the glory of our lives

1496
02:03:57,380 --> 02:04:02,380
In the story of our lives

1497
02:04:02,380 --> 02:04:12,380
Behold the glory of our lives

1498
02:04:12,380 --> 02:04:20,380
In the story of our lives

1499
02:04:50,380 --> 02:05:15,940
Okay, that was song number two in tonight's cage match, Echoing Green, story of our lives.

1500
02:05:15,940 --> 02:05:18,220
Let's see what we thought of that here in the room.

1501
02:05:18,220 --> 02:05:22,580
off with angel tonight I thought it did remind me a little bit of echo image

1502
02:05:22,580 --> 02:05:27,700
I'll give them that um it's pretty good

1503
02:05:28,540 --> 02:05:45,500
all right explicit all right bug what you give it a score on a scale of 10 all

1504
02:05:45,500 --> 02:05:50,500
Alright, fine. Loki. Loki. I liked it, so it gets a 9.

1505
02:05:53,500 --> 02:05:58,500
For once, I actually kind of like a song that Loki put in Cage Match a whole lot.

1506
02:05:58,500 --> 02:06:03,500
But, I think it's a little long and it's kind of weird for Cage Match. I don't know if I could hear that on our station.

1507
02:06:03,500 --> 02:06:08,500
But, I like the song, so I have to give it at least an 8. It's not like an 8 and a half.

1508
02:06:08,500 --> 02:06:15,500
Alright, let's get into song number three this week, which comes to us via Dark Sakura, even though she's not here tonight.

1509
02:06:15,500 --> 02:06:22,000
She still gets to put a song in, so here it is. She has chosen some, uh, Schwarzstein for you guys.

1510
02:06:22,000 --> 02:06:26,280
hmm and I believe it's a band she put in cage match before but this is a new song

1511
02:06:26,280 --> 02:06:29,640
it's called faster love and it's song number three in tonight's cage match

1512
02:06:29,640 --> 02:06:31,640
Enjoy you guys!

1513
02:07:29,640 --> 02:07:31,640
Oh

1514
02:07:59,640 --> 02:08:04,440
No

1515
02:08:29,640 --> 02:08:31,640
Oh

1516
02:08:59,640 --> 02:09:05,520
He'll go onEN

1517
02:09:29,640 --> 02:09:34,640
Oh,

1518
02:09:34,640 --> 02:09:39,640
Oh,

1519
02:09:39,640 --> 02:09:44,640
Oh,

1520
02:09:44,640 --> 02:09:49,640
Oh,

1521
02:09:49,640 --> 02:09:54,640
Oh,

1522
02:11:24,640 --> 02:11:27,640
Not faster love. I fucked that up when I was announcing it. It's faster love.

1523
02:11:27,640 --> 02:11:31,640
I have a strange feeling that Jamie picked that one on purpose with the holiday tomorrow. I don't know.

1524
02:11:31,640 --> 02:11:33,640
Uh, Angel!

1525
02:11:34,640 --> 02:11:36,640
It was okay.

1526
02:11:36,640 --> 02:11:38,640
I'm just a little thirsty.

1527
02:11:38,640 --> 02:11:40,640
Um...

1528
02:11:40,640 --> 02:11:42,640
Geez. Seven?

1529
02:11:42,640 --> 02:11:45,640
Alright, uh, explicit.

1530
02:11:45,640 --> 02:11:49,640
We have that, um, gothic, gothic feeling.

1531
02:11:49,640 --> 02:11:54,640
For some reason it kind of makes you feel like you're in a church listening to techno music, or...

1532
02:11:54,640 --> 02:11:58,640
I don't know how to interpret it. It's a different type of style of music, but...

1533
02:11:58,640 --> 02:12:00,640
I'll just give it an 8.

1534
02:12:04,640 --> 02:12:07,640
I'd dub it Cher Takes Up Nose Whistlin'.

1535
02:12:07,640 --> 02:12:09,640
It went on far too long. 3.

1536
02:12:37,640 --> 02:12:43,460
Okay, like just maybe want to slit my wrist. So I don't know. I guess I would give it like a

1537
02:12:44,500 --> 02:12:49,420
Six and a half seven. I'll give it seven overall. I mean, I like the music a lot

1538
02:12:49,420 --> 02:12:55,120
It was just the guy's voice was kind of like oh god. I wow. All right. So remember though, it isn't up to us

1539
02:12:55,120 --> 02:12:56,760
It's up to you guys in the chat room

1540
02:12:56,760 --> 02:12:59,840
So here it is a recap and then you can vote song number one

1541
02:12:59,840 --> 02:13:10,080

Alright guys, place, vote, now!

1547
02:13:39,620 --> 02:13:44,100
Send a private message to Skye in the chat room with your vote.

1548
02:13:44,100 --> 02:13:49,140
And we will tally all those votes up and let you guys know who the winner is very soon.

1549
02:13:49,140 --> 02:13:54,140
In the meantime, Loki, what's going on in the sim scene right now?

1550
02:13:54,140 --> 02:14:03,140
No, I'd hate to say this, but nothing, absolutely nada is happening in the sim scene right now.

1551
02:14:03,140 --> 02:14:10,140
I can't even, I can't really even comment on anything that's going on, cause really there's nothing going on.

1552
02:14:10,140 --> 02:14:17,140
Nothing, zip, no tournaments, no files, no nothing, just nothing.

1553
02:14:17,140 --> 02:14:24,140
However, however, I will take this time to play you one little song. Because, this is

1554
02:14:24,860 --> 02:14:31,300
a sim file, and yes, it's one of those ones I downloaded. Why? Because it says Max 300

1555
02:14:31,300 --> 02:14:33,740
Remix. So why do I-

1556
02:14:33,740 --> 02:14:35,140
I thought you hated those Maxes.

1557
02:14:35,140 --> 02:14:39,680
I have to listen to every single one. It is my duty to listen to them, just in case there's

1558
02:14:39,680 --> 02:14:45,940
a good one. And honestly, that happens every now and then. So, this song, for your listening

1559
02:14:45,940 --> 02:14:52,940
pleasure is Max Vagina. That's right, Max Vagina. Enjoy!

1560
02:15:15,940 --> 02:15:40,940
Oh yeah, you should have your voice in the cut, and then try to make it a little harder.

1561
02:15:40,940 --> 02:15:42,940
Fuck man, I don't believe you.

1562
02:15:42,940 --> 02:15:44,940
Take me in.

1563
02:15:44,940 --> 02:15:46,940
All right.

1564
02:15:46,940 --> 02:15:48,940
All right.

1565
02:15:48,940 --> 02:15:50,940
All right.

1566
02:15:50,940 --> 02:15:52,940
All right.

1567
02:15:52,940 --> 02:15:54,940
All right.

1568
02:15:54,940 --> 02:15:56,940
All right.

1569
02:15:56,940 --> 02:15:58,940
All right.

1570
02:15:58,940 --> 02:16:00,940
Let's do it!

1571
02:16:28,940 --> 02:16:42,660
So yeah, that's what's going on in the simp scene right there.

1572
02:16:42,660 --> 02:16:45,420
Uh, explicit, did you get a boner with that song?

1573
02:16:45,420 --> 02:16:48,860
I was about to say that, no!

1574
02:16:48,860 --> 02:16:49,860
It struck more.

1575
02:16:49,860 --> 02:16:50,860
What the hell was that?

1576
02:16:50,860 --> 02:16:51,860
Seriously, what was that?

1577
02:16:51,860 --> 02:16:52,860
What?

1578
02:16:52,860 --> 02:16:57,460
I can explain what that is.

1579
02:16:57,460 --> 02:16:59,660
I know where the sources are from.

1580
02:16:59,660 --> 02:17:01,620
Okay, first I take, wait a minute, wait a minute,

1581
02:17:01,620 --> 02:17:02,860
wait a minute, is this why you had to give up

1582
02:17:02,860 --> 02:17:04,060
the boner thing for Lent?

1583
02:17:06,820 --> 02:17:08,580
I'm not gonna comment from that.

1584
02:17:08,580 --> 02:17:10,540
It's not even close.

1585
02:17:11,500 --> 02:17:14,600
There's no visuals, sound effects, okay, I can handle.

1586
02:17:14,600 --> 02:17:17,180
I can hear, ah, ah, ah, all the time

1587
02:17:17,180 --> 02:17:21,300
without getting a boner, but visuals is where it comes from.

1588
02:17:21,300 --> 02:17:23,060
Anyways, back to the story.

1589
02:17:23,060 --> 02:17:24,740
That was crap.

1590
02:17:24,740 --> 02:17:26,580
I know the sources where it came from

1591
02:17:26,580 --> 02:17:34,420
basically Max 150 sound effects and I think the sound effects that were like

1592
02:17:34,420 --> 02:17:41,460
the porno sounds is from the video the porno video from City Crawford I

1593
02:17:41,460 --> 02:17:46,580
actually have that DVD too it's from a song by a group called the porno rockers

1594
02:17:46,580 --> 02:17:55,940
that's the group name yeah it's just like you know I don't know more like a

1595
02:17:55,940 --> 02:18:07,940
I download that stuff just because, you know, it's fun to hear. You just have to listen to them, because you don't really realize how bad they are. But then again, those are funny sometimes.

1596
02:18:07,940 --> 02:18:15,940
To the person who made that, screw you. Seriously, sorry, but what the hell was that?

1597
02:18:15,940 --> 02:18:19,940
You can think, BanzaiGTV.

1598
02:18:19,940 --> 02:18:23,940
Oh, I know, I've seen this guy remix, okay.

1599
02:18:23,940 --> 02:18:31,940
And he has done other sim files also like Sabrina, a step file announcer, which is someone on um...

1600
02:18:31,940 --> 02:18:39,940
But we have Paranoid Extreme, Rock Mix, Twinkle Twinkle, Shocking Star, the Sailor Moon theme, um...

1601
02:18:39,940 --> 02:18:45,940
Yeah, he's got quite a bit of stuff he's done, but um... whatever.

1602
02:18:45,940 --> 02:18:47,940
I don't know, I thought that was funny.

1603
02:18:47,940 --> 02:18:52,940
This is why I stopped downloading stuff from Be Mighty Star, unless they're good quality.

1604
02:18:52,940 --> 02:19:00,940
I'm sick and tired of seeing hearing max remixes that are cut and paste, more than I sound like too much cut and paste.

1605
02:19:00,940 --> 02:19:04,940
All I have to say is dot dot dot.

1606
02:19:04,940 --> 02:19:07,940
You guys want to find out who won tonight's cage match?

1607
02:19:07,940 --> 02:19:08,940
You ready to know?

1608
02:19:08,940 --> 02:19:09,940
Sure.

1609
02:19:09,940 --> 02:19:10,940
Alright, here it is.

1610
02:19:10,940 --> 02:19:15,940
Winning song of tonight's cage match as determined by your vote.

1611
02:19:15,940 --> 02:19:25,860
Freezepop! Two weeks in a row, Freezepop wins tonight. Not very many votes ahead of the

1612
02:19:25,860 --> 02:19:29,900
other two, though. Kind of surprising, it was kind of close. A lot more votes for songs

1613
02:19:29,900 --> 02:19:35,940
two and three than I would have guessed from the initial chat room feedback, so some very

1614
02:19:35,940 --> 02:19:42,420
interesting thoughts there in the chat room. Anyway, we're going to go to a break. I'm

1615
02:19:42,420 --> 02:19:46,400
out of theme ideas for this break, so I think we're just going to play random stuff in this

1616
02:19:46,400 --> 02:19:52,100
break. We'll come back after this with more Orange Launch Radio, including the FUs of

1617
02:19:52,100 --> 02:19:58,380
the week. Want to do a little more Skype later on if we can, et cetera, et cetera. So in

1618
02:19:58,380 --> 02:20:01,640
this break, we'll start off with the Shining Polaris. We haven't played this song in a

1619
02:20:01,640 --> 02:20:08,640
while. We'll be back after this. More Orange Lounge Radio.

1620
02:21:01,640 --> 02:21:06,640
The shine of my life

1621
02:21:08,640 --> 02:21:13,640
The shine of my life

1622
02:21:43,640 --> 02:21:48,640
If you will show me what you've got in your heart

1623
02:21:48,640 --> 02:21:54,640
Let me know you're where you're at

1624
02:22:24,640 --> 02:22:29,640
Make me do it any way

1625
02:22:33,640 --> 02:22:39,640
I don't want to be alone

1626
02:22:39,640 --> 02:22:45,640
I don't want to be alone

1627
02:22:45,640 --> 02:22:52,640
I don't want to be alone

1628
02:24:22,640 --> 02:24:29,640
Let's go!

1629
02:24:29,640 --> 02:24:36,640
Let's go!

1630
02:24:36,640 --> 02:24:43,640
Let's go!

1631
02:24:43,640 --> 02:24:50,640
Let's go!

1632
02:24:50,640 --> 02:24:51,640
Let's go!

1633
02:25:21,640 --> 02:25:46,140
One, two, one, two, three, four!

1634
02:25:46,140 --> 02:25:48,140
1, 2, 3, 4!

1635
02:26:46,140 --> 02:26:50,140
It's good to know that love's not going to pass

1636
02:27:00,140 --> 02:27:01,140
Let's go

1637
02:27:01,140 --> 02:27:04,140
Like a sushi-style delight

1638
02:27:04,140 --> 02:27:06,140
Like even falling like a light

1639
02:27:06,140 --> 02:27:09,140
We're gonna all be together soon, right?

1640
02:27:09,140 --> 02:27:11,140
Don't let me go

1641
02:27:11,140 --> 02:27:14,140
Like a sushi-style delight

1642
02:27:14,140 --> 02:27:33,140
It's time for the best part of Orange Lounge, this video starts!

1643
02:27:33,140 --> 02:27:34,140
Holla!

1644
02:27:34,140 --> 02:27:35,140
Stop!

1645
02:27:35,140 --> 02:27:36,140
Stop!

1646
02:27:36,140 --> 02:27:37,140
Stop!

1647
02:27:37,140 --> 02:27:38,140
Stop!

1648
02:27:38,140 --> 02:27:39,140
Stop!

1649
02:27:39,140 --> 02:27:40,140
Stop!

1650
02:27:40,140 --> 02:27:41,140
Stop!

1651
02:27:41,140 --> 02:27:47,380
Hello and welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio episode 131 in progress we just

1652
02:27:47,380 --> 02:27:50,420
wrapped up the cage match we're gonna move into the FUs of the week however

1653
02:27:50,420 --> 02:27:56,300
what we're going to do now is actually I wanted to talk to some folks some

1654
02:27:56,300 --> 02:28:00,420
friends of the show because I figured you know it's Valentine's Day and this

1655
02:28:00,420 --> 02:28:05,100
would be an appropriate theme to do right we're gonna talk to an actual DDR

1656
02:28:05,100 --> 02:28:09,940
couple this is gonna be nice all right let's talk to them let me give them a

1657
02:28:09,940 --> 02:28:14,660
call and see if they pick up. I think it's something to fit with the theme of the holiday

1658
02:28:14,660 --> 02:28:17,660
coming up. One ringy dingy.

1659
02:28:17,660 --> 02:28:33,300
Hello. Hello. Hello. Hi, is this Jason and Rai-chan? It may be. I think it is. It is.

1660
02:28:33,300 --> 02:28:38,420
How are you guys? We're pretty good. Happy Valentine's Day a little early to you guys.

1661
02:28:38,420 --> 02:28:39,420
Thank you.

1662
02:28:39,420 --> 02:28:42,220
Now you guys are under the same roof right now, correct?

1663
02:28:42,220 --> 02:28:43,220
Yep.

1664
02:28:43,220 --> 02:28:44,220
Thankfully.

1665
02:28:44,220 --> 02:28:45,940
Aww, so cute.

1666
02:28:45,940 --> 02:28:49,500
Because now, for those that don't know, you guys are kind of doing one of those long distance

1667
02:28:49,500 --> 02:28:51,140
thingy thingies, right?

1668
02:28:51,140 --> 02:28:52,140
Yep.

1669
02:28:52,140 --> 02:28:54,540
So you have to travel once in a while to see each other, so.

1670
02:28:54,540 --> 02:28:55,540
Yep.

1671
02:28:55,540 --> 02:28:56,540
That's what's going on right now.

1672
02:28:56,540 --> 02:29:01,220
Well, with the holiday coming up, and I can't help but think of all those threads on DDR

1673
02:29:01,220 --> 02:29:05,840
Freak that goes, oh my gods, how do I meet a girlfriend playing DDR?

1674
02:29:05,840 --> 02:29:08,920
So I just thought maybe, you know, you guys could share a little bit about how you guys

1675
02:29:08,920 --> 02:29:12,840
met and, you know, how it moved on, everything like that, if you could give us a little history

1676
02:29:12,840 --> 02:29:14,840
of your guys' relationship.

1677
02:29:14,840 --> 02:29:23,680
Well, see, me being a whole Southwest moderator, I, um, flirted over private messages.

1678
02:29:23,680 --> 02:29:26,840
That's the way all girls' hearts don't, you know, I mean, come on, Rob.

1679
02:29:26,840 --> 02:29:27,840
Oh, I forgot.

1680
02:29:27,840 --> 02:29:31,280
Yeah, that's right, the moderatorship on DDR Freak instantly gives you a huge internet

1681
02:29:31,280 --> 02:29:33,280
penis, I forgot about that.

1682
02:29:33,280 --> 02:29:34,280
Exactly.

1683
02:29:34,280 --> 02:29:40,360
basically the way we see it is just she uh we at southwest had a little what do you look like

1684
02:29:40,360 --> 02:29:46,200
thread going and so she posted some pictures of herself and me being the good dutiful

1685
02:29:47,080 --> 02:29:52,040
moderator had to tell her that hey right-hand your images are too big could you link them for me

1686
02:29:52,040 --> 02:29:58,920
please and as soon as i did that i was rummaging around live journal and apparently she knew one

1687
02:29:58,920 --> 02:30:02,280
friends as well. I saw her avatar in a picture,

1688
02:30:02,280 --> 02:30:05,960
in a comment, and we just kinda started talking.

1689
02:30:05,960 --> 02:30:09,320
And you actually forgot to mention the fact that

1690
02:30:09,320 --> 02:30:13,040
in that PM it said, I hate to cover up such a pretty face.

1691
02:30:13,040 --> 02:30:17,040
Oh, of course, you have to have them.

1692
02:30:17,040 --> 02:30:20,400
Oh, that's so cute.

1693
02:30:20,400 --> 02:30:23,280
Right now, what was your reaction when you got the private message? Were you like,

1694
02:30:23,280 --> 02:30:27,400
ah, who's this weirdo hitting on me, or what? At that point, I didn't see it as that.

1695
02:30:27,400 --> 02:30:32,400
It's kind of amazing because I was still, oh my god, it's the moderator, he's messaging me.

1696
02:30:36,400 --> 02:30:41,400
So you guys didn't meet necessarily at an arcade or anything, you actually met through the online forums.

1697
02:30:42,400 --> 02:30:44,400
So what was the first time you guys met in person?

1698
02:30:46,400 --> 02:30:47,400
November 1st.

1699
02:30:47,400 --> 02:30:49,400
Yes, the night after Halloween.

1700
02:30:49,400 --> 02:30:52,400
How did it work out, how did you guys meet, how did it all happen?

1701
02:30:52,400 --> 02:30:58,400
I was going to take a trip up to Colorado, and I did.

1702
02:30:58,400 --> 02:31:00,400
It's just that simple, huh?

1703
02:31:00,400 --> 02:31:01,400
Pretty much.

1704
02:31:01,400 --> 02:31:04,400
Wow, well you make interviewing really easy then.

1705
02:31:04,400 --> 02:31:07,400
I make it that easy.

1706
02:31:07,400 --> 02:31:09,400
How long have you guys been together now?

1707
02:31:09,400 --> 02:31:14,400
Officially, it would be a year and a month now,

1708
02:31:14,400 --> 02:31:17,400
and that was only three months before when we first met,

1709
02:31:17,400 --> 02:31:19,400
so one year and four months now,

1710
02:31:19,400 --> 02:31:21,400
and one year and one month officially.

1711
02:31:21,400 --> 02:31:39,400
Wow, how cute. So, um, so do you guys play DDR together or any of that dorky stuff? Or what do you guys, is DDR just kind of there? It's just an interest you guys both have? Or do you sometimes go out and do the nerdy bamani things together, like travel to arcades? Or what do you guys do?

1712
02:31:39,400 --> 02:31:47,400
Yesterday we went to MGL. Well, most of Jason played. The night before that we went and played some 2DX.

1713
02:31:47,400 --> 02:31:51,400
Played a little bit of DDR. Beat Mania 3, Dance Mania.

1714
02:31:55,400 --> 02:32:00,400
She owns me in home versions. I usually do it a little bit better in the arcade, but not always.

1715
02:32:00,400 --> 02:32:04,780
Oh that's kinda cute. Any plans for the big day tomorrow?

1716
02:32:04,780 --> 02:32:08,380
Uh, going to work unfortunately for me

1717
02:32:08,380 --> 02:32:12,540
but I'm gonna go in early so I can get out early and take her out to dinner or something really nice.

1718
02:32:12,540 --> 02:32:18,260
Did somebody say fucking in the microphone? Shame on you, this is a family show.

1719
02:32:18,260 --> 02:32:21,380
Bug, Bug just, was that Angel?

1720
02:32:21,380 --> 02:32:24,620
Angel did that? No. It was Bug.

1721
02:32:24,620 --> 02:32:28,660
Bug was whispering in the microphone, fucking.

1722
02:32:28,660 --> 02:32:31,660
You probably just couldn't hear it.

1723
02:32:31,660 --> 02:32:32,340
I see.

1724
02:32:32,340 --> 02:32:34,020
That's none of your business.

1725
02:32:34,020 --> 02:32:35,180
That's none of your business.

1726
02:32:35,180 --> 02:32:37,580
Don't you know that's rude?

1727
02:32:37,580 --> 02:32:38,500
Damn straight.

1728
02:32:38,500 --> 02:32:41,020
Besides, we all know they're going

1729
02:32:41,020 --> 02:32:44,420
to stay virginal until they get married, right?

1730
02:32:44,420 --> 02:32:44,940
Yeah.

1731
02:32:44,940 --> 02:32:47,740
OK, anyway, let's change the topic.

1732
02:32:50,740 --> 02:32:51,500
Do you have any?

1733
02:32:51,500 --> 02:32:53,660
I thought I already changed the topic right there.

1734
02:32:53,660 --> 02:32:57,060
Do you guys have any advice for those guys out there

1735
02:32:57,060 --> 02:33:01,300
that are all sad because of the Valentine's Day holiday and all they want is a gamer girlfriend.

1736
02:33:01,300 --> 02:33:02,740
Do you guys have any advice?

1737
02:33:02,740 --> 02:33:11,980
Stop whining, stop bitching, stop obsessing and be yourself and try opening your mouth

1738
02:33:11,980 --> 02:33:14,300
and shutting it normally.

1739
02:33:14,300 --> 02:33:15,300
And commit suicide.

1740
02:33:15,300 --> 02:33:17,500
Amen to all that.

1741
02:33:17,500 --> 02:33:18,500
Stop it, Loki.

1742
02:33:18,500 --> 02:33:19,500
Stop it.

1743
02:33:19,500 --> 02:33:21,300
Invite lots of loot.

1744
02:33:21,300 --> 02:33:23,300
I don't know.

1745
02:33:31,300 --> 02:33:33,300
Stop trying so hard.

1746
02:33:35,300 --> 02:33:37,300
I don't know.

1747
02:33:41,300 --> 02:33:43,300
Just don't be freakish about it.

1748
02:33:43,300 --> 02:33:46,300
We've had some pretty freaky people come up to me, so.

1749
02:33:47,300 --> 02:33:50,300
She's also had people try hitting on me. You or her?

1750
02:33:51,300 --> 02:34:00,300
Well, they express their, uh, fads. I wouldn't say, no, not fantasies, but they express their heavy likes for me. Other guys, yes.

1751
02:34:01,300 --> 02:34:04,300
And I apologize profusely about that, Jason.

1752
02:34:06,300 --> 02:34:08,300
It's okay, Rob. We know you're all.

1753
02:34:08,300 --> 02:34:16,300
All these nerdy people need to do is just rent a porno, get a nice dinner, and it's like a date right there.

1754
02:34:19,300 --> 02:34:28,300
You know, sadly enough, they actually have DVDs out there, because I've gotten them free from...

1755
02:34:28,300 --> 02:34:44,300
Oh, what is it? I don't remember the company. But anyways, there are these DVDs of, like, these women that, you know, pose for those, um, you know, like, import car magazines and stuff like that, and they actually have virtual dates as a feature on the DVD.

1756
02:34:44,300 --> 02:34:46,300
So if you get one of those, you know, it's...

1757
02:34:46,300 --> 02:34:47,300
Wow.

1758
02:34:47,300 --> 02:34:50,300
For some reason, I failed to be surprised.

1759
02:34:50,300 --> 02:34:51,300
Well...

1760
02:34:51,300 --> 02:34:52,300
Tomorrow, I'm gonna send myself...

1761
02:34:52,300 --> 02:34:55,300
I mean, I know it firsthand, though. Thank you.

1762
02:34:55,300 --> 02:34:59,500
Tomorrow I'm going to send myself flowers at work, so I can look popular.

1763
02:34:59,500 --> 02:35:00,500
What, Angel?

1764
02:35:00,500 --> 02:35:05,780
I can send you some pies in Final Fantasy XI and be like, Happy Valentine's Day.

1765
02:35:05,780 --> 02:35:09,420
Yeah, this Valentine's Day I'm going to spend some time with the one I love, so I'll be

1766
02:35:09,420 --> 02:35:11,620
in Final Fantasy XI all evening.

1767
02:35:11,620 --> 02:35:12,620
Okay.

1768
02:35:12,620 --> 02:35:21,900
No, actually, I got invited to a gay singles dinner.

1769
02:35:21,900 --> 02:35:25,900
And how gay is that in the overview?

1770
02:35:25,900 --> 02:35:28,900
But yeah, definitely I'm going, obviously.

1771
02:35:28,900 --> 02:35:32,900
One of my buddies is having it, so I'm like, okay, yeah, it sounds like fun.

1772
02:35:32,900 --> 02:35:35,900
So there's something for everybody on Valentine's Day. What?

1773
02:35:35,900 --> 02:35:38,900
I'm sure you'll have a gay old time.

1774
02:35:38,900 --> 02:35:43,900
I will, and then I'm going to come home and masturbate until the sun rises next day.

1775
02:35:43,900 --> 02:35:44,900
I'm kidding, I'm kidding.

1776
02:35:44,900 --> 02:35:45,900
Thanks for the details.

1777
02:35:45,900 --> 02:35:47,900
I'm kidding, I'm totally kidding.

1778
02:35:47,900 --> 02:35:49,900
Anything else you guys want to share about...

1779
02:35:49,900 --> 02:35:54,120
that much down below it shut up anything else you guys want to share any any

1780
02:35:54,120 --> 02:35:59,560
exciting things going on this week while while she's paying a visit or for some

1781
02:35:59,560 --> 02:36:02,520
reason I keep thinking she's gonna leave on Saturday but she's actually here

1782
02:36:02,520 --> 02:36:07,620
until Tuesday and so that's me happy every day I think I'm oh you're cutting

1783
02:36:07,620 --> 02:36:12,920
out for half that sentence so that's okay it's still cute all right I had to

1784
02:36:12,920 --> 02:36:15,900
share a headset to the best of our ability oh I see that's cool

1785
02:36:15,900 --> 02:36:20,900
Rai Chan, any plans for this week?

1786
02:36:20,900 --> 02:36:22,900
Not really.

1787
02:36:22,900 --> 02:36:24,900
Just enjoying each other's company?

1788
02:36:24,900 --> 02:36:26,900
Just spend it normally, like our advice says.

1789
02:36:26,900 --> 02:36:28,900
Okay, that's cool. Works for me.

1790
02:36:28,900 --> 02:36:31,900
Alright you guys, thanks for letting us bug you, and have a happy Valentine's Day, okay?

1791
02:36:31,900 --> 02:36:32,900
Thank you, Rob.

1792
02:36:32,900 --> 02:36:33,900
You're welcome.

1793
02:36:33,900 --> 02:36:34,900
Thank you.

1794
02:36:34,900 --> 02:36:35,900
Bye, kisses.

1795
02:36:35,900 --> 02:36:36,900
Bye, everybody.

1796
02:36:36,900 --> 02:36:37,900
Bye-bye.

1797
02:36:37,900 --> 02:36:38,900
Oh, it was nice to talk to them.

1798
02:36:38,900 --> 02:36:39,900
What?

1799
02:36:39,900 --> 02:36:40,900
What?

1800
02:36:40,900 --> 02:36:42,900
None of us here are bitter, right?

1801
02:36:42,900 --> 02:36:56,400
see single single single dating engaged so so we got mostly single but anyway oh

1802
02:36:56,400 --> 02:37:02,520
well what we're gonna do now is we're gonna get into another segment I thought

1803
02:37:02,520 --> 02:37:05,820
it would be very good to follow up the very lovey-dovey ah isn't that cute

1804
02:37:05,820 --> 02:37:11,760
segment with one of our favorite segments the F use of the week so what

1805
02:37:11,760 --> 02:37:14,140
What we're going to do now is get into those FUs of the Week.

1806
02:37:14,140 --> 02:37:15,140
This is the part...

1807
02:37:15,140 --> 02:37:17,680
Oh, by the way, if you guys want to send in an FU of the Week, just send me a private

1808
02:37:17,680 --> 02:37:18,680
message.

1809
02:37:18,680 --> 02:37:22,820
My name is Skye in the chatroom with your FU, but please try to keep it somewhat reasonable

1810
02:37:22,820 --> 02:37:23,820
in length.

1811
02:37:23,820 --> 02:37:28,660
If it's too long, I'm going to cut it short because I can do that.

1812
02:37:28,660 --> 02:37:31,640
That includes you in studio, all right?

1813
02:37:31,640 --> 02:37:36,580
So, this is the part where I would normally ask, Jamie, why do we do the FUs of the Week

1814
02:37:36,580 --> 02:37:37,580
every single week?

1815
02:37:37,580 --> 02:37:40,840
But she's not here, so I'm going to ask, Loki, why is it we do the FUs of the Week every

1816
02:37:40,840 --> 02:37:59,960
single week. Because we have anger.

1817
02:37:59,960 --> 02:38:04,560
Even though Dark Sacra is not here tonight, she's spending the time with her boyfriend.

1818
02:38:04,560 --> 02:38:09,400
She did want me to enter in an F.U. on behalf. She would like to give an F.U. to people,

1819
02:38:09,400 --> 02:38:11,280
in general, everybody.

1820
02:38:11,280 --> 02:38:13,480
So there you go.

1821
02:38:13,480 --> 02:38:14,900
That's alright.

1822
02:38:14,900 --> 02:38:18,280
Loki's turn!

1823
02:38:18,280 --> 02:38:23,440
Fuck you dude, the company that sold me the goddamn battery for my orange box PC

1824
02:38:23,440 --> 02:38:25,340
because the battery is

1825
02:38:25,340 --> 02:38:29,480
defective. It will not charge, in fact

1826
02:38:29,480 --> 02:38:33,840
it charges according to the battery about only 75% of the way because only three of the four

1827
02:38:33,840 --> 02:38:35,200
lights are on there.

1828
02:38:35,200 --> 02:38:41,040
And, not only that, when I was trying to charge it and plugging it in, it's all sparky now, the little bottom thing.

1829
02:38:41,040 --> 02:38:43,340
So that's probably not a good sign either.

1830
02:38:43,340 --> 02:38:47,800
So anyways, so fuck you then, because that battery cost me almost $200.

1831
02:38:47,800 --> 02:38:49,940
And that doesn't make me too happy.

1832
02:38:49,940 --> 02:38:51,140
Um...

1833
02:38:51,140 --> 02:38:55,380
And then finally, uh, fuck you to The Matrix Online, because...

1834
02:38:55,380 --> 02:39:00,980
I went to go play it yesterday, just to give it a second, you know, go around, and um...

1835
02:39:00,980 --> 02:39:08,980
It was admins only on that one server I was on, so I said fuck it, I'm tired of this, so I'm not gonna play it.

1836
02:39:08,980 --> 02:39:19,980
And, um, sucks for me for not having any money, so, uh, fucking me for spending my money on useless shit that I don't need, um, aka, uh, the orange box.

1837
02:39:19,980 --> 02:39:24,980
And yeah, that's pretty much it right now.

1838
02:39:49,980 --> 02:39:55,020
judges or whatever so an F you to that an F you to the fact that I really didn't

1839
02:39:55,020 --> 02:39:57,860
do a whole lot with my week but I had a really good weekend so I can't really

1840
02:39:57,860 --> 02:40:02,300
complain it kind of leaves everything on a high note so I guess it's really it I

1841
02:40:02,300 --> 02:40:05,620
don't have a whole lot else to vent about tonight so let's move on to our

1842
02:40:05,620 --> 02:40:12,140
guests in studio we'll start it off with the ER angel all right F you to me for

1843
02:40:12,140 --> 02:40:16,540
like not watching my book more carefully this week because I did get it swiped at

1844
02:40:16,540 --> 02:40:22,000
least you know from 48 hours and I got all like paranoid and stressed and all

1845
02:40:22,000 --> 02:40:30,440
that crap until the book got returned to me on Thursday and all that so screw

1846
02:40:30,440 --> 02:40:39,840
that I've used to kthr closing down because you know it it was too soon in

1847
02:40:39,840 --> 02:40:46,480
my opinion but you know there's nothing about now so whatever I'll live all

1848
02:40:46,480 --> 02:40:52,560
you know, I'll move on. And, uh, fucking it being an I.L. because it just makes, you

1849
02:40:52,560 --> 02:41:00,560
know, that alarm that much sooner to go off and it sucks, and whatever. Um, I guess that's

1850
02:41:00,560 --> 02:41:07,560
about it. I don't really know. I lost my share of that, so I guess this doesn't even matter.

1851
02:41:07,560 --> 02:41:14,560
Alright. So, whatever, I'm done. Alright, let's move on to Bug. Fucking to myself because

1852
02:41:14,560 --> 02:41:18,560
I forgot who the vice used to be after funeral party on Tuesday night.

1853
02:41:21,560 --> 02:41:23,560
It was Jagermeister.

1854
02:41:23,560 --> 02:41:26,560
You're in trouble. No, that's alright. It's cool. I understand.

1855
02:41:26,560 --> 02:41:27,560
But, uh...

1856
02:41:27,560 --> 02:41:31,560
Too bad all those people aren't still in town, though. I bet they'd love to see me now.

1857
02:41:31,560 --> 02:41:35,560
Most of them are. Most of them are, actually. Most of them didn't actually leak out.

1858
02:41:35,560 --> 02:41:38,560
Oh, really? Oh, we should all hang out or something.

1859
02:41:38,560 --> 02:41:40,560
We're gonna try. But, uh, uh...

1860
02:41:40,560 --> 02:41:43,560
I'm a little different than I was in high school.

1861
02:41:43,560 --> 02:41:47,560
No. No one would have guessed.

1862
02:41:47,560 --> 02:41:49,560
Oh, your plane's showing.

1863
02:41:49,560 --> 02:41:51,560
Oh, sorry.

1864
02:41:51,560 --> 02:41:53,560
Uh...

1865
02:41:53,560 --> 02:41:56,560
If you took the barrier, you'd be so damn far away.

1866
02:41:56,560 --> 02:41:58,560
Yeah. Agreed.

1867
02:41:58,560 --> 02:42:01,560
I just don't want to know about this naked hot tubbing stuff.

1868
02:42:01,560 --> 02:42:02,560
Huh?

1869
02:42:02,560 --> 02:42:04,560
Whose place was this at?

1870
02:42:04,560 --> 02:42:06,560
I can't tell you.

1871
02:42:06,560 --> 02:42:08,560
Okay, alright, fine.

1872
02:42:08,560 --> 02:42:12,560
There was a dual G5 Power Mac involved here.

1873
02:42:12,560 --> 02:42:35,660
power Mac okay hot all right yeah fair enough all right explicit I want to give

1874
02:42:35,660 --> 02:42:40,420
an FD to some white Ford mistake we're trying to run my ass over when when it

1875
02:42:40,420 --> 02:42:45,420
says walk on my on my part when I'm walking in this when I'm walking in the

1876
02:42:45,420 --> 02:42:48,900
pedestrian no I should not be run over because just because you're in a damn

1877
02:42:48,900 --> 02:42:55,740

1878
02:42:55,740 --> 02:43:01,380
and f you to in Zuma 469 for causing a shitload of drama the tournament

1879
02:43:01,380 --> 02:43:05,900
obviously you know if you can't stand it you don't like the rules don't don't

1880
02:43:05,900 --> 02:43:08,780
even go to the tournament you send us to numerous tournaments and

1881
02:43:08,780 --> 02:43:13,740
we're getting sick of it. You bring your drama personal drama that forced the

1882
02:43:13,740 --> 02:43:16,540
team four six nine shouldn't even be involved and you bring it in front of our

1883
02:43:16,540 --> 02:43:21,420
faces. Look what happens. Now you're banned. Luckily we did not kick

1884
02:43:21,420 --> 02:43:26,020
your ass. I want to give an eff you for my video

1885
02:43:26,020 --> 02:43:32,220
card from frying up like shit. Somehow like I think I started smoking my

1886
02:43:32,220 --> 02:43:41,220
video card for Radeon 9800. I still have to fix the problem, but if I can't fix that I have to do it with it right now.

1887
02:43:41,220 --> 02:43:47,220
And FU2 whoever turned off my fucking firewall, now I got a fucking virus I couldn't even delete

1888
02:43:47,220 --> 02:43:53,220
until I do some very good research towards it. Because not even Attaware or any of those other programs

1889
02:43:53,220 --> 02:44:00,460
could even take it out f you to whoever was spreading a fucking rumor about my

1890
02:44:00,460 --> 02:44:03,660
family and stuff that someone said that one of our family members hate each

1891
02:44:03,660 --> 02:44:07,500
other you know how much pain pain that is where the family if someone ever hears

1892
02:44:07,500 --> 02:44:12,620
that type of shit towards it hurts a lot of tears have been going through that

1893
02:44:12,620 --> 02:44:18,340
type of issue but luckily everything is solved and whoever said that have a shit

1894
02:44:18,340 --> 02:44:25,300
should be killed if you to being broke as hell that spent a lot of money and

1895
02:44:25,300 --> 02:44:29,740
and now I owe like some people for the tournament since that's what some people

1896
02:44:29,740 --> 02:44:35,300
say that the tournament got rigged over prizes get the fuck over it a few to

1897
02:44:35,300 --> 02:44:39,820
losing a shitload of money on Friday at the Thunder Valley casino on blackjack

1898
02:44:39,820 --> 02:44:47,660
that was me last week except not blackjack well in the fat yeah I lost I

1899
02:44:47,660 --> 02:44:53,700
I lost fucking 90 bucks over a fucking blackjack itself because someone some people can't even play fucking blackjack pretty well

1900
02:44:53,700 --> 02:44:55,700
They hit him when I'm not supposed to hit

1901
02:44:56,420 --> 02:44:58,420
Okay, if you see a six on the field

1902
02:44:58,460 --> 02:45:00,140
You're not supposed to fucking hit

1903
02:45:00,140 --> 02:45:03,880
You're supposed to leave it stay because they know they're at the US and it's in trouble

1904
02:45:03,880 --> 02:45:07,780
Yeah, you hit and they gave him 21 you get fucked over. Thanks a lot

1905
02:45:08,780 --> 02:45:12,520
And since it is a three-hour show, I want to say to be continued

1906
02:45:13,100 --> 02:45:15,100
my ink will never

1907
02:45:15,100 --> 02:45:28,820
Alright, let's move on to the next segment, which would be the chatroom FUs.

1908
02:45:28,820 --> 02:45:32,360
Starting it off with MPQ.

1909
02:45:32,360 --> 02:45:38,100
In order of severity, FU to the laggy broadcast, FU to myself for inadvertently reformatting

1910
02:45:38,100 --> 02:45:43,580
my hard drive twice in a week, FU to my parents for losing the wireless network password,

1911
02:45:43,580 --> 02:45:50,020
And F you to my little sister for drawing on my laptop with a permanent marker.

1912
02:45:50,020 --> 02:45:54,640
Dark Knight says I think this might be a running F you, but F you to Valentine's Day and being

1913
02:45:54,640 --> 02:45:58,820
broke and single and having to work on Valentine's Day.

1914
02:45:58,820 --> 02:46:04,260
Zaku says F you to being worried about getting work, F you to Valentine's Day for being so

1915
02:46:04,260 --> 02:46:08,260
discriminating to singles, and F you to having to wait till I'm employed so that I can buy

1916
02:46:08,260 --> 02:46:11,420
the Bomani hardware I desire.

1917
02:46:11,420 --> 02:46:15,620
illusion says f you to valentine's day okay i've got two girls that were in

1918
02:46:15,620 --> 02:46:16,780

1919
02:46:16,780 --> 02:46:19,420
but they tell me this after they get a boyfriend what the fuck

1920
02:46:19,420 --> 02:46:23,060
anyway i'm gonna draw my valentine's sorrow in a big tub of chocolate ice

1921
02:46:23,060 --> 02:46:23,700

1922
02:46:23,700 --> 02:46:28,860
and multiple viewings of when harry met sally

1924
02:46:33,060 --> 02:46:33,860
now you know

1925
02:46:33,860 --> 02:46:38,420
they said uh... i guess we could say f u to anyone in advance that f u's

1926
02:46:38,420 --> 02:46:51,180
Valentine's Day. RPGKing7 says, if you do get this FU, an FU to all the employers that

1927
02:46:51,180 --> 02:46:58,380
won't hire me. I'm desperate for a job, but not male gigolo desperate. And an FU to losing

1928
02:46:58,380 --> 02:47:08,140
all my PlayStation 2 data and to Valentine's Day. Step it off. 1215 says F you to constantly

1929
02:47:08,140 --> 02:47:15,180
being broke and never being able to get anything I want. And Llama Juice says F you to red

1930
02:47:15,180 --> 02:47:22,900
octane for losing my order for my metal pad that I waited the two months for. And to Microsoft

1931
02:47:22,900 --> 02:47:29,300
because my xbox isn't reading discs anymore

1932
02:47:29,300 --> 02:47:35,200
and dork says f you to valentine's day and girls insert frowny face here

1933
02:47:35,200 --> 02:47:39,480
oh i think that was a bit of a recurring thing there tonight the uh...

1934
02:47:39,480 --> 02:47:45,520
f you to uh... valentine's day so yes hugs to dk

1935
02:47:45,520 --> 02:47:48,040
oh well what just him

1936
02:47:48,040 --> 02:47:51,820
i know i know a lot of people are sad about valentine's day though

1937
02:47:51,820 --> 02:47:54,580
Okay, hugs to you too then. There. Better?

1938
02:47:54,580 --> 02:47:58,100
Much. Okay.

1939
02:47:58,100 --> 02:48:01,760
Um, let's see. When the hell is that you're watching, Loki? It looks like some

1940
02:48:01,760 --> 02:48:05,480
public access production of Superman. What is this?

1941
02:48:05,480 --> 02:48:09,100
It's the world's finest. It's a

1942
02:48:09,100 --> 02:48:16,100
fan-made trailer for a movie that doesn't exist.

1943
02:48:16,100 --> 02:48:19,300
Where do people get the time to do that? Seriously?

1944
02:48:19,300 --> 02:48:24,300
I mean, I guess, but then again, this coming from a guy who co-hosts a three-hour internet show dedicated to video games.

1945
02:48:24,300 --> 02:48:29,300
Well, this guy's actually trying to get himself, you know, work.

1946
02:48:29,300 --> 02:48:32,300
It's a director that does the stuff, and he's done the same ones.

1947
02:48:32,300 --> 02:48:38,300
He did another one called Batman Dead End, which was Batman vs. Alien vs. Predator.

1948
02:48:38,300 --> 02:48:40,300
It's a little short. It was really well done.

1949
02:48:40,300 --> 02:48:47,300
That was the one that was really cool in the beginning, and then when it was Predator-fied, I was like, this is gay.

1950
02:48:47,300 --> 02:48:55,300
But they did another one called Grayson 2 which is supposed to be like Robin stuff. It looks cool. I mean they have like pretty cool people.

1951
02:48:56,300 --> 02:49:00,300
It's better than your average fan film. Let's just put that one. But anyways, yeah.

1952
02:49:02,300 --> 02:49:06,300
Interesting. Where can you download that? Is that like an ain't it cool news thing?

1953
02:49:06,300 --> 02:49:15,300
I believe the Force.net has links to these. They have like a fan film link for like other stuff.

1954
02:49:15,300 --> 02:49:24,300
You can also get some weird Matrix ones too, but like another one that's pretty cool is Matrix Run Program, I think is the name of that one.

1955
02:49:24,300 --> 02:49:26,300
That was pretty well done too.

1956
02:49:26,300 --> 02:49:39,300
So, this director's trying to find work, so what he does is he wastes tons of money making these fake ass trailers for movies so that internet nerds can get big boners over them. Is that correct? Except explicit.

1957
02:49:39,300 --> 02:49:51,300
Exactly. Alright. Interesting. Alright, we're going to take a quick break and then when we come back, we're going to wrap things up.

1958
02:49:51,300 --> 02:49:53,300
And please keep your boners secured at all times.

1959
02:49:53,300 --> 02:49:54,300
at all times.

1960
02:49:54,300 --> 02:49:58,300
And then there might be a few other surprises when we come back from break. We'll see.

1961
02:49:58,300 --> 02:50:02,300
But no boners. So, yes, Logie.

1962
02:50:02,300 --> 02:50:08,300
I mean, these would, I mean, obviously they're not theatrical quality, but I could definitely see this being like a TV movie or something.

1963
02:50:08,300 --> 02:50:15,300
They really should let this guy make movies. Because I think they'd be pretty decent. I mean, they'd be better than like, you know, Lois and Clark and stuff.

1964
02:50:15,300 --> 02:50:19,300
I don't think they should let this guy ever make a movie.

1965
02:50:19,300 --> 02:50:26,300
They let the guy that made, uh, what was it, Unbow or whatever his name was, okay, they let him make movies. Why not this guy?

1966
02:50:26,300 --> 02:50:34,300
Because I would rather Uwe Boll make movies than this guy because if this guy actually gets a deal and actually gets to make a movie,

1967
02:50:34,300 --> 02:50:43,300
every freaking person on the internet will be turning out crap trying to imitate this. So sorry, dude, but, uh, hope it doesn't work.

1968
02:50:45,300 --> 02:50:47,300
No comments to that, Loki?

1969
02:50:47,300 --> 02:50:51,520
That was completely and utterly retarded your idea, I'm sorry

1970
02:50:53,080 --> 02:50:58,440
Suck it. All right, we're gonna go to a break. We'll be back. I thought we could do some disco tunes in this break

1971
02:50:58,440 --> 02:51:00,440
So we'll be back after this

1972
02:51:28,440 --> 02:51:30,440
We're gonna ride for life

1973
02:51:31,440 --> 02:51:33,440
Baby, ride for life

1974
02:51:34,440 --> 02:51:37,440
We're gonna move tonight

1975
02:51:39,440 --> 02:51:41,440
Let's move tonight

1976
02:51:42,440 --> 02:51:44,440
Yeah, we'll ride for life

1977
02:51:46,440 --> 02:51:48,440
Baby, ride for life

1978
02:51:49,440 --> 02:51:52,440
We're gonna move tonight

1979
02:51:52,440 --> 02:51:56,440
Oh, let this go

1980
02:51:56,440 --> 02:52:00,440
Alright

1981
02:52:00,440 --> 02:52:04,440
Oh, let this go

1982
02:52:04,440 --> 02:52:08,440
Stand up, stand up, stand up, stand up, alright

1983
02:52:08,440 --> 02:52:12,440
Let this go, try to get through

1984
02:52:12,440 --> 02:52:16,440
Alright, alright, alright

1985
02:52:16,440 --> 02:52:20,440
Let this go, say it shows

1986
02:52:20,440 --> 02:52:25,060
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

1987
02:52:28,160 --> 02:52:29,800
Break down

1988
02:52:29,800 --> 02:52:31,960
With me and she

1989
02:52:31,960 --> 02:52:33,760
Break down

1990
02:52:33,760 --> 02:52:35,560
With me and she

1991
02:52:35,560 --> 02:52:39,400
Here I am gonna stand my ground

1992
02:52:39,400 --> 02:52:43,060
Nothing in the world's gonna bring me down

1993
02:52:43,060 --> 02:52:47,060
Hit me, yell and give me roar

1994
02:52:47,060 --> 02:52:50,400
I am something that you can't ignore

1995
02:52:50,400 --> 02:52:54,400
I am here for all of us

1996
02:52:54,400 --> 02:53:01,400
I am this and we're all so fabulous

1997
02:53:01,400 --> 02:53:04,400
So free go, so beautiful

1998
02:53:04,400 --> 02:53:07,400
So free gay, free go, so fabulous

1999
02:53:07,400 --> 02:53:12,400
So free gay, free go, so free gay

You're strong like a deer, like a deer

2001
02:53:14,400 --> 02:53:16,400
Better be ready, gonna get your attention

2002
02:53:16,400 --> 02:53:36,400
I'm an original baby, no carbon copies, a fake verse for me

2003
02:54:06,400 --> 02:54:12,800
radio. We are back here on Orange Lounge radio

2004
02:54:12,800 --> 02:54:17,960
about to wrap stuff up. But you know when we get towards the end of the show

2005
02:54:17,960 --> 02:54:22,520
and we're running out of things to talk about, we always turn to the DDR community to

2006
02:54:22,520 --> 02:54:24,200
find us some inspiration

2007
02:54:24,200 --> 02:54:27,360
and of course we like to head on over to the biggest

2008
02:54:27,360 --> 02:54:31,720
DDR site out there, the ddrfreak.com

2009
02:54:31,720 --> 02:54:35,720
and we like to find ourselves the ddrfreak

2010
02:54:35,720 --> 02:54:39,160
Post of the week, so we're gonna look at our DDR chit chat post of the week

2011
02:54:42,240 --> 02:54:44,240
Did you do

2012
02:54:45,360 --> 02:54:50,080
It was actually slim pickins this week there was really not a whole lot of newbie posts

2013
02:54:50,080 --> 02:54:52,680
I mean there was some but nothing that hilarious

2014
02:54:52,680 --> 02:54:56,960
So this is hard for me to make a determination, but I did decide on this this post here

2015
02:54:57,360 --> 02:55:01,880
This is a post and it's called American songs are wrecking

2016
02:55:02,520 --> 02:55:04,520
DDR um

2017
02:55:04,520 --> 02:55:10,420
Um and the post goes like this um whose idea was it to put songs made by like

2018
02:55:10,420 --> 02:55:17,840
Cher and Madonna in DDR unless you're a housewife these songs gotta go they

2019
02:55:17,840 --> 02:55:22,300
didn't put max period in extreme u.s. and I didn't think they're making DDR anymore

2020
02:55:22,300 --> 02:55:26,620
anyway mod chips are becoming illegal and buying another Japanese PlayStation

2021
02:55:26,620 --> 02:55:30,420
2 will only cost too much and I can't play my Japan only songs because of

2022
02:55:30,420 --> 02:55:34,460
stupid American songs not to be offensive I'm just saying that the

2023
02:55:34,460 --> 02:55:39,100
American songs are stopping songs like Sakura and max period for making it into

2024
02:55:39,100 --> 02:55:45,780
us DDR games I got a question does it really matter if a song is like 300

2025
02:55:45,780 --> 02:55:50,260
beats p.m. or more because honestly everyone who complains about this is

2026
02:55:50,260 --> 02:55:55,080
wants a max song in it or paranoia survivor paranoia survivor max into any

2027
02:55:55,080 --> 02:55:59,140
of the u.s. releases of course everyone knows there's no paranoia survivor or

2028
02:55:59,140 --> 02:56:04,140
and I don't know if you know about the Paranoia Survivor Max, like the Vulture Mix or the extreme series.

2029
02:56:04,140 --> 02:56:09,140
Hell, Paranoia Survivor and Survivor Max are just sped up versions of the other song!

2030
02:56:09,140 --> 02:56:16,140
Wooo! Paranoia Survivor and Wooo! Paranoia Survivor Max! Which is a sped up version of the song.

2031
02:56:16,140 --> 02:56:24,140
Wow, that took a lot of work there. See, that's what's sad. People, you know, they probably looked at these people playing Sim Files and they're like,

2032
02:56:24,140 --> 02:56:30,880
They like max 600s just sped up max 300. Let's do that with paranoid survivor. We have two songs for the price of one

2033
02:56:32,540 --> 02:56:33,980
Exactly I

2034
02:56:33,980 --> 02:56:38,660
Don't know about you guys, but I think DDR is all about fun and trying to play Sakura

2035
02:56:39,080 --> 02:56:41,080
Heavy on a home pad is not fun

2036
02:56:42,080 --> 02:56:44,080
dancing around to Sharon Madonna fun

2037
02:56:45,800 --> 02:56:47,520
I mean, I don't mind about the song list

2038
02:56:47,520 --> 02:56:51,880
But some people just have to get a grip that mix is not gonna have all ten footers

2039
02:56:51,880 --> 02:56:55,880
Rob, that's just the gay in you, saying that.

2040
02:56:55,880 --> 02:56:59,880
Hey! I like

2041
02:56:59,880 --> 02:57:03,880
a lot of songs in DDR, not just the gay ones.

2042
02:57:03,880 --> 02:57:07,880
So, Angel, your thoughts.

2043
02:57:07,880 --> 02:57:11,880
You have any thoughts on this one? No? She's shaking her head.

2044
02:57:11,880 --> 02:57:15,880
Okay. Instead she's giving me candy. Ooh, that's a very good thing. I like candy.

2045
02:57:15,880 --> 02:57:19,880
Candy's a good way to make me happy. These little, like, they look like Pringles, but they're not. They're little chocolate chip things.

2046
02:57:19,880 --> 02:57:21,880
Swoops, is that what they're called?

2047
02:57:21,880 --> 02:57:27,880
Yeah, I mean, yeah, but related to my question, would anybody buy a mix that had

2048
02:57:27,880 --> 02:57:32,880
70 paranoia and 10 maxes all in just one package?

2049
02:57:32,880 --> 02:57:36,880
Yeah, yes they might.

2050
02:57:36,880 --> 02:57:39,880
Cause, honestly.

2051
02:57:39,880 --> 02:57:44,880
Seriously, why don't we release a home mix, and these are the songs we'll put in it.

2052
02:57:44,880 --> 02:57:50,600
put in it we'll put like max period paranoid survivor max the max 300 mix

2053
02:57:50,600 --> 02:57:54,360
from ultra mix to you know what fuck it we'll just license a whole bunch of

2054
02:57:54,360 --> 02:57:57,980
nine-inch nails and the crystal method and all these really fast groups to do

2055
02:57:57,980 --> 02:58:01,800
fast songs will license all their tracks and we'll put it in a home mix and we'll

2056
02:58:01,800 --> 02:58:07,960
call good fucking luck mix playing this on your fucking home pad

2057
02:58:07,960 --> 02:58:12,600
they could just do and fuse the song like everybody doesn't be my style max

2058
02:58:12,600 --> 02:58:24,600
I hope you own a fucking cobalt flux mix, seriously, because that's the only way you're going to pass any of this shit.

2059
02:58:24,600 --> 02:58:28,600
Or DDR controller mix. Button button revolution.

2060
02:58:28,600 --> 02:58:31,600
Rape rape revolution. How rapey that is.

2061
02:58:31,600 --> 02:58:36,600
Or America's Beatmania.

2062
02:58:36,600 --> 02:58:41,300
go that's what you guys that have won it wanted a beat mania USA there you go

2063
02:58:41,300 --> 02:58:45,600
they're just gonna release a DDR mix and have nothing but tens and 11s in it yeah

2064
02:58:45,600 --> 02:58:49,600
they'll have 11 footers in it now and they'll call it beat mania USA there it

2065
02:58:49,600 --> 02:59:01,280
is anyway I think that's gonna do it for tonight's episode of orange lounge radio

2066
02:59:01,280 --> 02:59:06,520
so now we're gonna go around and get everybody's final thought oh I do want

2067
02:59:06,520 --> 02:59:08,840
want to make a plug real fast though before we go around and get everybody's

2068
02:59:08,840 --> 02:59:13,400
final thought the podcast our podcast rocks seriously you should download it

2069
02:59:13,400 --> 02:59:17,080
although I do notice and if you haven't taken the poll that's on the main page

2070
02:59:17,080 --> 02:59:20,240
of orange lounge radio.com yet in the upper right hand corner if you haven't

2071
02:59:20,240 --> 02:59:23,040
taken that poll yet please do because it's helping us gauge a little bit I do

2072
02:59:23,040 --> 02:59:26,960
notice a lot of you are saying you can't listen to the podcast because it's kind

2073
02:59:26,960 --> 02:59:31,520
of complicated to set up and I would urge you to read through the

2074
02:59:31,520 --> 02:59:34,560
instructions on our website if that's one of you that if you mark that answer

2075
02:59:34,560 --> 02:59:38,640
or read through the instructions on our website under the Orange Lounge Radio To-Go edition

2076
02:59:38,640 --> 02:59:43,780
page, it's really easy. All you gotta do is download a program called iPodter, and you

2077
02:59:43,780 --> 02:59:49,880
can get this at, what, it's just ipodter.sourceforge.net, or even just put it into, like, Google, do

2078
02:59:49,880 --> 02:59:54,120
a search for it. It's really easy to find, and then it gives you, like, a window in there

2079
02:59:54,120 --> 02:59:59,680
where you put in a URL, just like a web browser. Put in our URL, it is super, super easy. Again,

2080
02:59:59,680 --> 03:00:04,680
You do not need an iPod or any type of portable MP3 device to listen to the show.

2081
03:00:04,680 --> 03:00:09,960
They only call it a podcast because it sounds cute and iPods happen to be popular.

2082
03:00:09,960 --> 03:00:11,320
You don't need one.

2083
03:00:11,320 --> 03:00:12,320
Logie?

2084
03:00:12,320 --> 03:00:18,600
I did find one of the songs that could be on that, you know, Good Fucking Luck mix.

2085
03:00:18,600 --> 03:00:19,600
Berserker, reality!

2086
03:00:19,600 --> 03:00:26,120
What the fuck?

2087
03:00:26,120 --> 03:00:30,120
And sadly enough, that is a sim file that can be found on BomaniStyle.com.

2088
03:00:30,120 --> 03:00:34,120
I've seen a lot of realities, I just don't download them.

2089
03:00:34,120 --> 03:00:38,120
You know what? We'll just let DM Ashura do all the music.

2090
03:00:38,120 --> 03:00:42,120
And then, you know what? DM Ashura will do all the music,

2091
03:00:42,120 --> 03:00:46,120
and then, um, who's that

2092
03:00:46,120 --> 03:00:50,120
kid that does all the crazy-ass Oni steps?

2093
03:00:50,120 --> 03:00:54,120
Everybody gets a big boner except for you when he releases a new sim file.

2094
03:00:54,120 --> 03:00:58,120
What is his name? And then he retired, came back.

2095
03:00:58,120 --> 03:01:02,120
No! What is it? Bimani ruler?

2096
03:01:02,120 --> 03:01:06,120
He can do all the steps.

2097
03:01:06,120 --> 03:01:10,120
Oh god. I don't even think he cares about zip files anymore.

2098
03:01:10,120 --> 03:01:14,120
Good for him. Alright. Obviously. Alright, now let's go around and get everybody's

2099
03:01:14,120 --> 03:01:18,120
final thought. Bug, your final thought. Naked hot tummy.

2100
03:01:18,120 --> 03:01:22,120
Explicit, your final thought.

2101
03:01:22,120 --> 03:01:26,120
I survived the anti-boner lent, so far.

2102
03:01:26,120 --> 03:01:26,620
So far.

2103
03:01:26,620 --> 03:01:29,120
So don't send me any more porn or anything like that.

2104
03:01:29,120 --> 03:01:31,120
And what is your email address?

2105
03:01:31,120 --> 03:01:32,120
Huh?

2106
03:01:32,120 --> 03:01:33,120
What is your email address?

2107
03:01:33,120 --> 03:01:36,120
Explicitalpha.yahoo.com

2108
03:01:36,120 --> 03:01:38,120
Just look up his profile on DDR3.

2109
03:01:38,120 --> 03:01:40,120
Angel, your final thought?

2110
03:01:40,120 --> 03:01:46,120
Need more time in a week to play, um, Final Fantasy XI. Yeah.

2111
03:01:46,120 --> 03:01:51,520
my final thought is I don't want to go back to work tomorrow and tomorrow's

2112
03:01:51,520 --> 03:01:54,560
Valentine's Day and it's gonna suck because everybody's gonna have flowers

2113
03:01:54,560 --> 03:02:00,120
and shit and I don't have that stuff Loki your final thought I know I'm

2114
03:02:00,120 --> 03:02:08,520
clicking and I don't care now my final thought is I don't want to have to

2115
03:02:08,520 --> 03:02:17,040

2116
03:02:17,040 --> 03:02:22,520

You are beautiful.

I would like to make love to you.

2130
03:03:19,560 --> 03:03:22,080
Damn bitch, you stupid fly.

Damn bitch, you stupid fly.

2133
03:03:27,460 --> 03:03:30,880
Let me pull up to your bumper and smack that monkey.

2134
03:03:30,880 --> 03:03:32,760
Greeting old friends.

2135
03:03:32,760 --> 03:03:33,760
Hello sir.

2136
03:03:33,760 --> 03:03:35,760
What up, dawg?

2137
03:03:35,760 --> 03:03:37,760
What up, dawg?

2138
03:03:38,760 --> 03:03:40,760
May I borrow some money?

2139
03:03:40,760 --> 03:03:43,760
Hey, let me hold some ends. I'll hit you back on the first, my brother.

2140

Hey, let me hold some ends. I will hit you back on the first, my brother.

2141
03:03:49,760 --> 03:03:51,760
You don't have it? Thanks anyway.

03:03:51,760 --> 03:03:53,760
F*** you!

What up?

2147
03:04:01,760 --> 03:04:04,960
I admire your fashionable running shoes.

2148
03:04:04,960 --> 03:04:09,040
Drop them Nikes off your ass before I blast you, motherf***er!

2149
03:04:09,040 --> 03:04:13,840
Drop them Nikes off your ass before I blast you, motherf***er!

2150
03:04:13,840 --> 03:04:16,960
I used to be a stuck-up white boy faking the funk.

2151
03:04:16,960 --> 03:04:20,800
Bump that! I ain't bullsh** on Front Street no more,
