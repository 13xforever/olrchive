00:14:28,210 --> 00:14:31,791
[SPEAKER_20]: In progress, we're here on this Valentine's Day eve.

[SPEAKER_20]: Yes, you're in the same boat that I am, so the next break of songs will be for you.

68
00:14:47,066 --> 00:14:50,930
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm going to pick some good bitter, angry songs for the next break.

69
00:14:51,130 --> 00:14:52,511
[SPEAKER_20]: I don't know if there's really a whole lot of

70
00:14:53,208 --> 00:14:53,428
[SPEAKER_20]: Jamey

71
00:15:14,033 --> 00:15:15,954
[SPEAKER_20]: AKA DarkSakura is not here tonight.

72
00:15:16,534 --> 00:15:20,016
[SPEAKER_20]: She is spending Valentine's Day Eve with her man.

73
00:15:20,496 --> 00:15:25,158
[SPEAKER_20]: Because, you know, she's engaged and, you know, has her hetero life partner or whatever.

74
00:15:25,799 --> 00:15:27,299
[SPEAKER_20]: I can't remember how she refers to them.

75
00:15:27,340 --> 00:15:29,741
[SPEAKER_20]: But, you know, they're out and doing their thing.

76
00:15:30,541 --> 00:15:34,123
[SPEAKER_20]: I guess because tomorrow being a work day, it's a little harder to do stuff.

77
00:15:34,163 --> 00:15:37,905
[SPEAKER_20]: So they're doing their lovey-dovey stuff tonight.

78
00:15:39,525 --> 00:15:40,886
[SPEAKER_20]: I suppose we can forgive it.

79
00:15:41,426 --> 00:15:42,687
[SPEAKER_20]: As long as it's only once a year.

80
00:15:43,493 --> 00:15:46,456
[SPEAKER_20]: The minute they try to bring Valentine's Day into another holiday, forget it.

81
00:15:46,536 --> 00:15:47,016
[SPEAKER_20]: It's done with.

82
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:53,563
[SPEAKER_20]: Wait a minute, wait, wait.

83
00:15:53,963 --> 00:15:55,424
[SPEAKER_20]: Loki's saying something about, I'll allow it.

84
00:15:56,405 --> 00:15:59,008
[SPEAKER_20]: Loki, I thought Valentine's Day was a pain in the ass for you.

85
00:15:59,028 --> 00:16:05,734
[SPEAKER_19]: I said, I'll allow it, as Judge Mills Lane would say.

86
00:16:07,035 --> 00:16:07,336
[SPEAKER_20]: Alright.

87
00:16:09,864 --> 00:16:13,487
[SPEAKER_20]: We'll start off the show as we usually do, playing a little bit of How Was Your Week, How Was Your Day?

88
00:16:14,067 --> 00:16:19,311
[SPEAKER_20]: And I guess we all know that DarkSakura is the one that usually starts us off, and we all know that she's doing great tonight, I'm sure.

89
00:16:19,892 --> 00:16:22,734
[SPEAKER_20]: So, you know, well, I guess we'll go to DDR Angel.

90
00:16:22,814 --> 00:16:24,135
[SPEAKER_20]: DDR Angel, how was your week, how was your day?

91
00:16:24,956 --> 00:16:27,538
[SPEAKER_30]: Actually, it was kind of depressing for once.

92
00:16:28,218 --> 00:16:28,939
[SPEAKER_30]: Me, depressed?

93
00:16:29,019 --> 00:16:29,739
[SPEAKER_30]: Yeah, right.

94
00:16:29,879 --> 00:16:31,400
[SPEAKER_30]: Okay.

95
00:16:32,221 --> 00:16:34,923
[SPEAKER_30]: First of all, like, Tuesday when I went to school, everything was fine.

96
00:16:36,024 --> 00:16:38,506
[SPEAKER_30]: Until, like, just before my second class.

97
00:16:39,011 --> 00:16:42,512
[SPEAKER_30]: When I realized my Linux book was missing.

98
00:16:43,492 --> 00:16:46,773
[SPEAKER_30]: And so I was in a slight panic, emailed the teacher, all that stuff.

99
00:16:47,953 --> 00:16:48,973
[SPEAKER_30]: Wondering where the hell it went.

100
00:16:49,293 --> 00:16:55,535
[SPEAKER_30]: And also, in the next 48 hours, I was preparing myself to actually have to go out and buy the book again.

101
00:16:56,255 --> 00:17:04,797
[SPEAKER_30]: But I went to class Thursday, and it turns out that the student that sits next to me decided to grab it on accident.

102
00:17:04,837 --> 00:17:06,477
[SPEAKER_30]: So she ran up to me on...

103
00:17:07,267 --> 00:17:36,117
[SPEAKER_30]: Thursday and gave it back and you know was really apologetic and stuff and so it was just a turn around from a bad situation to a good one again so that turned out really well and the next depressing thing that happened to me is unfortunately permanent so that kind of sucks the radio station I was DJing for KTHR also known as Pulse before it was KTHR um

104
00:17:36,980 --> 00:17:46,743
[SPEAKER_30]: They ended up shutting down this week, so after three years of my life, I'm no longer DJing for a station that I actually like DJing for, so that kind of sucks.

105
00:17:46,763 --> 00:17:51,745
[SPEAKER_20]: You know what, and all that news about what they're doing, I think it's time for us to quit too.

106
00:17:52,586 --> 00:18:03,189
[SPEAKER_30]: Well, it was sad for me because, honestly, if it wasn't for Orange Lounge, I wouldn't have found them or anything like that, and that was two and a half years ago.

107
00:18:06,056 --> 00:18:14,442
[SPEAKER_30]: Something like that, when you went to your buddy's show and boom, next thing you know I'm DJing for them.

108
00:18:14,602 --> 00:18:17,004
[SPEAKER_20]: Oh, that's right.

109
00:18:17,064 --> 00:18:21,447
[SPEAKER_20]: You didn't find out about them until I went and did the guest thing on their network.

110
00:18:21,827 --> 00:18:22,607
[SPEAKER_13]: Yep, that's right.

111
00:18:22,808 --> 00:18:25,790
[SPEAKER_20]: And you know, that DJ, she's back in town this weekend, so it's kind of neat.

112
00:18:27,030 --> 00:18:28,852
[SPEAKER_20]: I don't think she's listening, though.

113
00:18:28,972 --> 00:18:30,253
[SPEAKER_20]: No, she's out.

114
00:18:30,353 --> 00:18:32,214
[SPEAKER_20]: She's either working or she's partying.

115
00:18:32,674 --> 00:18:34,215
[SPEAKER_20]: There's not a whole lot else to do in town with you.

116
00:18:34,235 --> 00:18:35,016
[SPEAKER_20]: Probably partying, you know.

117
00:18:36,118 --> 00:18:36,418
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh yeah.

118
00:18:36,778 --> 00:19:04,555
[SPEAKER_30]: So, you know, I either have a choice of going to a newer radio station or just kind of hanging low and whatever and, you know, if it wasn't, I realize that Orange Lodge was obviously my first radio station I was associated with, so you guys are always going to be first, but as far as, you know, side work was concerned, the other radio station was just what I did and for half the week I was just really down and

119
00:19:05,345 --> 00:19:08,689
[SPEAKER_30]: I still am a little bit, but I'm getting over it a little bit, you know, slowly.

120
00:19:09,469 --> 00:19:17,658
[SPEAKER_20]: Well, you know, and as I said, because you'd mentioned this, and LJ, LiveJournal, for those who don't know, LJ is a place where we can all get a little emo when we need to be.

121
00:19:18,019 --> 00:19:18,759
[SPEAKER_29]: Yeah, really.

122
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:21,462
[SPEAKER_20]: You made a little bit of an emo post earlier this week.

123
00:19:21,883 --> 00:19:22,263
[SPEAKER_29]: I did.

124
00:19:22,283 --> 00:19:22,904
[SPEAKER_29]: Because you were sad.

125
00:19:22,944 --> 00:19:24,806
[SPEAKER_29]: You were like, I'm so depressed.

126
00:19:25,627 --> 00:19:26,788
[SPEAKER_29]: I really was, though.

127
00:19:27,188 --> 00:19:46,426
[SPEAKER_20]: But, I mean, you know, as I mentioned in LiveJournal, I'll tell you again, for the benefit of our listeners, you know, when a radio station like that closes down, you just have to remember the good memories you have of the people you met there, and, you know, you'll know those people for some time, and some of them will go off and do other projects, and, you know, maybe you can help them out with that, but you'll remember the radio station for a long time.

128
00:19:46,747 --> 00:19:47,607
[SPEAKER_20]: You know, it's inevitable.

129
00:19:47,728 --> 00:19:50,230
[SPEAKER_20]: Orange Lounge Radio will not last forever, you know.

130
00:19:50,660 --> 00:19:52,721
[SPEAKER_20]: The three of us have to die someday.

131
00:19:54,402 --> 00:20:00,585
[SPEAKER_19]: So... I don't plan on dying ever, so... I can't help it.

132
00:20:00,645 --> 00:20:03,547
[SPEAKER_20]: Oh, you clicked on... Oh, you know the secret to immortality then.

133
00:20:03,827 --> 00:20:05,028
[SPEAKER_20]: From that banner on the internet.

134
00:20:05,068 --> 00:20:06,849
[SPEAKER_20]: The secret of... Forget it.

135
00:20:07,089 --> 00:20:07,949
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, go fake.

136
00:20:08,369 --> 00:20:13,352
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, they sent out one spam mail seeing who had actually, you know, hit on that.

137
00:20:13,612 --> 00:20:15,433
[SPEAKER_19]: And actually one of them was real.

138
00:20:18,455 --> 00:20:18,815
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh, I see.

139
00:20:18,855 --> 00:20:19,055
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay.

140
00:20:19,075 --> 00:20:19,155
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay.

141
00:20:19,542 --> 00:20:20,203
[SPEAKER_19]: And you know what?

142
00:20:20,663 --> 00:20:23,606
[SPEAKER_19]: Not only will I live forever, but my penis is larger than ever.

143
00:20:27,449 --> 00:20:30,291
[SPEAKER_19]: And you're getting V1 Agra really cheap?

144
00:20:31,012 --> 00:20:31,432
[SPEAKER_20]: Exactly.

145
00:20:31,472 --> 00:20:32,233
[SPEAKER_31]: V1 Agra?

146
00:20:32,493 --> 00:20:34,235
[SPEAKER_20]: And my breasts, they're firm and large.

147
00:20:36,597 --> 00:20:43,623
[SPEAKER_20]: Anyway, it's inevitable that Orange Lounge Radio is going to die someday, so I hope you all don't.

148
00:20:44,264 --> 00:20:45,365
[SPEAKER_20]: Get too teary-eyed when it happens.

149
00:20:45,405 --> 00:20:48,967
[SPEAKER_20]: Someday, but I hope not soon, just because... It's not going to happen soon.

150
00:20:49,367 --> 00:20:50,428
[SPEAKER_30]: I don't think so.

151
00:20:50,708 --> 00:21:01,736
[SPEAKER_20]: Unless we get the offer to take this to a real thing, like satellite radio, or go to some television outlet.

152
00:21:05,138 --> 00:21:10,822
[SPEAKER_20]: As I've said this time and time again, I would sell out in .5 seconds to the highest bidder.

153
00:21:12,307 --> 00:21:14,748
[SPEAKER_20]: My soul is up for... I'm putting my soul up on eBay.

154
00:21:16,549 --> 00:21:16,789
[SPEAKER_20]: Anyway.

155
00:21:17,890 --> 00:21:19,471
[SPEAKER_20]: I'd be like, you're going to pay me to do this?

156
00:21:19,871 --> 00:21:20,191
[SPEAKER_20]: Okay.

157
00:21:21,512 --> 00:21:23,373
[SPEAKER_20]: Do you want to pay me for doing Wayne's World?

158
00:21:23,553 --> 00:21:23,953
[SPEAKER_20]: Sure.

159
00:21:25,774 --> 00:21:27,955
[SPEAKER_30]: How did I know you were going to go there?

160
00:21:28,836 --> 00:21:30,156
[SPEAKER_20]: That movie is like my anthem.

161
00:21:30,617 --> 00:21:32,257
[SPEAKER_20]: It's like... Anyway, sorry.

162
00:21:32,478 --> 00:21:33,018
[SPEAKER_20]: I'll shut up now.

163
00:21:33,358 --> 00:21:33,558
[SPEAKER_20]: Angel.

164
00:21:34,238 --> 00:21:37,060
[SPEAKER_30]: Um... Jeez, what else did I get into this week?

165
00:21:38,181 --> 00:21:38,921
[SPEAKER_30]: Uh...

166
00:21:40,296 --> 00:21:41,837
[SPEAKER_30]: Some online game that I can't talk about.

167
00:21:42,857 --> 00:21:43,797
[SPEAKER_30]: Loki knows what I'm talking about.

168
00:21:43,957 --> 00:21:44,217
[SPEAKER_30]: Anyway.

169
00:21:45,598 --> 00:21:47,699
[SPEAKER_30]: Yeah, so that was pretty fun.

170
00:21:49,259 --> 00:21:52,720
[SPEAKER_30]: God, I haven't even been able to play Final Fantasy XI this week.

171
00:21:53,260 --> 00:21:55,061
[SPEAKER_30]: Just because of all the crap that's been going on.

172
00:21:58,062 --> 00:21:58,842
[SPEAKER_30]: I guess that's it.

173
00:21:58,862 --> 00:22:01,723
[SPEAKER_30]: I can't really remember much else.

174
00:22:01,943 --> 00:22:02,844
[SPEAKER_30]: Great.

175
00:22:03,204 --> 00:22:03,544
[SPEAKER_30]: What?

176
00:22:04,004 --> 00:22:06,585
[SPEAKER_20]: I just had to point out, they're making bids in the chat room right now.

177
00:22:10,567 --> 00:22:11,168
[SPEAKER_20]: No comment.

178
00:22:11,248 --> 00:22:13,129
[SPEAKER_20]: I need to learn to keep my mouth shut on this show.

179
00:22:13,390 --> 00:22:19,095
[SPEAKER_20]: I know it would make for interesting radio if I didn't say anything, but every time I open my mouth, I get myself in trouble with the chat room.

180
00:22:19,135 --> 00:22:22,017
[SPEAKER_19]: All I got to do is pay more than I'm making out of my job, which isn't that much.

181
00:22:22,037 --> 00:22:22,638
[SPEAKER_19]: Which isn't much.

182
00:22:22,758 --> 00:22:23,919
[SPEAKER_20]: Some of these bids are making.

183
00:22:24,179 --> 00:22:25,340
[SPEAKER_20]: Some of these bids are making.

184
00:22:27,942 --> 00:22:29,524
[SPEAKER_19]: So far, all but, like, one.

185
00:22:29,544 --> 00:22:33,667
[SPEAKER_17]: Anyway, sorry, Angel.

186
00:22:33,687 --> 00:22:34,328
[SPEAKER_17]: We keep cutting you off.

187
00:22:34,548 --> 00:22:35,069
[SPEAKER_30]: No, it's okay.

188
00:22:35,369 --> 00:22:36,009
[SPEAKER_30]: I would go for the...

189
00:22:37,466 --> 00:22:38,187
[SPEAKER_30]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

190
00:23:03,331 --> 00:23:10,976
[SPEAKER_20]: Well, kind of, except you don't have, like, the... There's no prostitutes and gamblers and all that stuff that basically... Because you heard this is what happened to Sims Online.

191
00:23:11,016 --> 00:23:17,840
[SPEAKER_20]: Sims Online was supposed to be this, you know, great new online experience game, and it quickly turned into every Vegas street corner.

192
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:19,301
[SPEAKER_19]: That's fucking awesome.

193
00:23:20,181 --> 00:23:24,224
[SPEAKER_19]: I would play Sims Online if it didn't cost money, just for that.

194
00:23:24,984 --> 00:23:31,128
[SPEAKER_30]: Well, theirs is actually kind of worse, because you end up using your own money to get, you know, game money...

195
00:23:31,713 --> 00:23:32,513
[SPEAKER_30]: and all that stuff.

196
00:23:32,853 --> 00:23:35,094
[SPEAKER_30]: So you kind of have to watch yourself, otherwise you'll go broke.

197
00:23:35,714 --> 00:23:37,355
[SPEAKER_20]: That's the other interesting thing about there.

198
00:23:37,455 --> 00:23:43,496
[SPEAKER_20]: They have made buying the in-game currency with real money, like, not a problem.

199
00:23:44,256 --> 00:23:45,957
[SPEAKER_30]: Seriously, because you'll... That's the way it should be.

200
00:23:45,997 --> 00:23:59,541
[SPEAKER_20]: Whereas every other online role-playing game, you know, Final Fantasy, EverQuest, World of Warcraft, you know, they frown on people selling the gold or the gil or the whatevers outside of the game for real money.

201
00:23:59,821 --> 00:24:00,461
[SPEAKER_20]: But there...

202
00:24:01,829 --> 00:24:03,709
[SPEAKER_19]: I haven't learned jack shit from farming.

203
00:24:04,069 --> 00:24:07,170
[SPEAKER_19]: All I learned is that I might die if I'm not paying attention.

204
00:24:09,970 --> 00:24:14,171
[SPEAKER_30]: Yeah, so, I mean, there's kind of different like that.

205
00:24:15,591 --> 00:24:18,292
[SPEAKER_30]: I ended up getting there married, quote, end quote.

206
00:24:20,032 --> 00:24:20,272
[SPEAKER_20]: Aww.

207
00:24:20,292 --> 00:24:20,652
[SPEAKER_30]: Shut up.

208
00:24:22,433 --> 00:24:23,313
[SPEAKER_30]: It was cute, whatever.

209
00:24:23,433 --> 00:24:24,893
[SPEAKER_20]: So you had an online wedding?

210
00:24:25,973 --> 00:24:26,093
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah.

211
00:24:26,753 --> 00:24:27,493
[SPEAKER_20]: Only in America.

212
00:24:28,014 --> 00:24:30,554
[SPEAKER_19]: I want a there honeymoon.

213
00:24:33,228 --> 00:24:34,849
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah, what did you do for the there honeymoon?

214
00:24:35,710 --> 00:24:36,871
[SPEAKER_30]: Um, nothing yet.

215
00:24:36,911 --> 00:24:37,651
[SPEAKER_30]: He said he's going to do it.

216
00:24:38,152 --> 00:24:39,633
[SPEAKER_30]: He said he'll probably do it tonight or whatever.

217
00:24:39,653 --> 00:24:40,954
[SPEAKER_22]: He's going to do it tonight.

218
00:24:40,974 --> 00:24:42,014
[SPEAKER_22]: He's going to do it tonight.

219
00:24:42,034 --> 00:24:43,335
[SPEAKER_30]: Shut the hell up.

220
00:24:44,136 --> 00:24:46,558
[SPEAKER_30]: Hey, it was kind of cool, but he shot me off a cliff.

221
00:24:47,518 --> 00:24:48,279
[SPEAKER_30]: Yeah, shut up.

222
00:24:48,739 --> 00:24:49,740
[SPEAKER_30]: I knew that was going to go there.

223
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:52,042
[SPEAKER_20]: Can you buy some there condoms with real life money?

224
00:24:53,683 --> 00:24:54,824
[SPEAKER_30]: See, now I got them started.

225
00:24:54,864 --> 00:24:56,265
[SPEAKER_30]: What the hell was I thinking?

226
00:24:56,285 --> 00:24:57,846
[SPEAKER_19]: You better get there morning after pill.

227
00:24:58,559 --> 00:25:01,121
[SPEAKER_19]: Otherwise you're going to have their illegitimate child.

228
00:25:01,382 --> 00:25:03,243
[SPEAKER_30]: Okay, this is just as bad as a piss joke.

229
00:25:03,283 --> 00:25:04,504
[SPEAKER_19]: Who's their baby daddy?

230
00:25:06,786 --> 00:25:07,306
[SPEAKER_30]: Hey now.

231
00:25:07,787 --> 00:25:08,087
[SPEAKER_22]: Sorry.

232
00:25:08,187 --> 00:25:09,528
[SPEAKER_30]: Anyway, he shot me off a cliff.

233
00:25:09,588 --> 00:25:10,269
[SPEAKER_30]: That was kind of funny.

234
00:25:10,869 --> 00:25:11,510
[SPEAKER_30]: Wait, what?

235
00:25:12,771 --> 00:25:17,775
[SPEAKER_30]: We jumped into a buggy, quote unquote, their car, and he hit the boost and I jumped off.

236
00:25:18,255 --> 00:25:19,016
[SPEAKER_30]: We flew off the cliff.

237
00:25:19,076 --> 00:25:19,697
[SPEAKER_30]: It was kind of funny.

238
00:25:20,157 --> 00:25:22,279
[SPEAKER_20]: So you got married and then jumped off a cliff?

239
00:25:22,399 --> 00:25:22,559
[SPEAKER_30]: Yeah.

240
00:25:23,630 --> 00:25:30,471
[SPEAKER_19]: Well, you know, I did watch a story last night about this guy that was trying to get people to commit suicide on Valentine's Day.

241
00:25:31,211 --> 00:25:36,052
[SPEAKER_19]: See, all it takes is one bitter person and they're all dead.

242
00:25:40,573 --> 00:25:41,193
[SPEAKER_19]: Wow.

243
00:25:41,773 --> 00:25:42,433
[SPEAKER_20]: They're dead.

244
00:25:42,453 --> 00:25:48,815
[SPEAKER_30]: If only you guys knew about that game, you probably wouldn't be picking on me so much, but hey, it's always fun.

245
00:25:49,515 --> 00:25:50,855
[SPEAKER_20]: It sounds like fun, it's just I...

246
00:25:51,266 --> 00:25:51,526
[SPEAKER_20]: Firebomber

247
00:26:20,049 --> 00:26:21,630
[SPEAKER_20]: I don't know if it's Boma or Bama.

248
00:26:22,050 --> 00:26:22,650
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm going to say Bama.

249
00:26:22,670 --> 00:26:23,971
[SPEAKER_20]: I like that because it sounds like fire than bomb.

250
00:26:24,251 --> 00:26:27,532
[SPEAKER_20]: FireBama says their STDs suck, so be careful.

251
00:26:28,953 --> 00:26:29,853
[SPEAKER_20]: Don't get their herpes.

252
00:26:31,354 --> 00:26:32,514
[SPEAKER_30]: Yeah.

253
00:26:33,295 --> 00:26:33,575
[SPEAKER_30]: No.

254
00:26:33,775 --> 00:26:37,097
[SPEAKER_19]: That would suck if you could catch diseases from online games.

255
00:26:37,357 --> 00:26:37,937
[SPEAKER_30]: Oh, jeez.

256
00:26:40,138 --> 00:26:42,979
[SPEAKER_20]: I think online games are kind of a disease in general.

257
00:26:43,039 --> 00:26:43,919
[SPEAKER_20]: I mean, seriously.

258
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:44,920
[SPEAKER_20]: There's got to be...

259
00:26:45,430 --> 00:26:51,232
[SPEAKER_20]: I bet if I went to a shrink and I told them how much I played Final Fantasy XI, she'd fucking slap me upside the head and say, GO OUTSIDE!

260
00:26:51,793 --> 00:26:55,474
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm gonna sue Final Fantasy XI and Square Enix for making me lazy.

261
00:26:56,154 --> 00:27:03,877
[SPEAKER_20]: But they have their disclaimer at the start of the game that says, you know, Don't forget your family and friends and work.

262
00:27:04,118 --> 00:27:07,799
[SPEAKER_19]: No, I didn't forget my family, friends, and work, but I'm sitting on my ass playing the game.

263
00:27:08,519 --> 00:27:12,741
[SPEAKER_19]: I acknowledge that they exist, however, you know.

264
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:15,261
[SPEAKER_31]: I think about them all the time.

265
00:27:15,561 --> 00:27:17,622
[SPEAKER_31]: And I think about how much they don't love me.

266
00:27:18,622 --> 00:27:20,883
[SPEAKER_29]: Which is why I'm playing this goddamn game.

267
00:27:21,863 --> 00:27:24,565
[SPEAKER_29]: If I get killed by a goblin one more... Okay, I'll shut up.

268
00:27:29,046 --> 00:27:29,607
[SPEAKER_29]: Next!

269
00:27:30,187 --> 00:27:31,047
[SPEAKER_29]: Because I'm done.

270
00:27:31,607 --> 00:27:32,588
[SPEAKER_19]: Loki, how was your week?

271
00:27:32,628 --> 00:27:33,148
[SPEAKER_19]: How was your day?

272
00:27:34,949 --> 00:27:40,071
[SPEAKER_19]: Well... I don't even really remember what happened this week.

273
00:27:41,031 --> 00:27:42,892
[SPEAKER_19]: Not much of anything I'd imagine.

274
00:27:43,636 --> 00:27:57,430
[SPEAKER_19]: Um, let's see, well, today, I spent most of the day playing Final Fantasy, drinking milk and eating bacon bits, and, and, um, then what else did I do?

275
00:27:57,450 --> 00:28:06,739
[SPEAKER_20]: Oh yeah, I started charging my battery, but I found out that, wait, bacon bits, you just eat them right out of the, right out of the can, right?

276
00:28:06,759 --> 00:28:07,160
[SPEAKER_19]: Come here.

277
00:28:08,931 --> 00:28:10,652
[SPEAKER_20]: You just eat the bacon bits right out of the jar.

278
00:28:10,672 --> 00:28:12,232
[SPEAKER_19]: Yep, ate about half the container.

279
00:28:12,252 --> 00:28:13,512
[SPEAKER_20]: Can I put the jar on the webcam?

280
00:28:13,872 --> 00:28:15,893
[SPEAKER_20]: I don't know if the cam's actually up and running just yet.

281
00:28:15,953 --> 00:28:16,493
[SPEAKER_20]: I'll check on that first.

282
00:28:16,513 --> 00:28:19,033
[SPEAKER_19]: It looks up and running, but it might not be up and running on the website.

283
00:28:19,053 --> 00:28:20,734
[SPEAKER_20]: I have to make sure everything's running on the web end.

284
00:28:21,154 --> 00:28:21,574
[SPEAKER_20]: No, it's not.

285
00:28:21,854 --> 00:28:22,514
[SPEAKER_20]: I will set it up.

286
00:28:22,554 --> 00:28:25,695
[SPEAKER_20]: I'll set the webcam up, and I will go show the jar of bacon bits while you talk about your week here.

287
00:28:27,255 --> 00:28:29,075
[SPEAKER_19]: So anyways, yeah, I was eating those.

288
00:28:29,215 --> 00:28:35,337
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't know why, because I had this really crappy soup for lunch, and it just wasn't hitting the spot.

289
00:28:35,837 --> 00:28:37,417
[SPEAKER_19]: So bacon bits, it was, and

290
00:28:37,972 --> 00:29:06,905
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't know, it worked, so whatever, um, so then, also, um, what else happened this week, oh, my co-worker quit finally, and my other co-worker put in his notice, so, I'm all alone, and, um, what else did I do, oh, some other crap I worked on, the thing that pissed me off though is my battery, that cost me $200 is fucked up, and, so now I gotta return it, so, you know, hey,

291
00:29:08,988 --> 00:29:09,408
[SPEAKER_19]: What the hell?

292
00:29:11,309 --> 00:29:16,550
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh yeah, so then as I'm playing Final Fantasy and partying and eating bacon bits, I spill that crap all over the place.

293
00:29:17,330 --> 00:29:23,932
[SPEAKER_20]: So, you know, probably just something stuck in my... For the record, these are imitation bacon buds.

294
00:29:25,753 --> 00:29:27,613
[SPEAKER_19]: Whatever, it's the cheap shit, okay?

295
00:29:29,954 --> 00:29:30,694
[SPEAKER_19]: Don't be hatin'.

296
00:29:31,654 --> 00:29:32,575
[SPEAKER_19]: Nelly likes them too.

297
00:29:34,315 --> 00:29:36,016
[SPEAKER_19]: So anyways, and see you ate him?

298
00:29:36,376 --> 00:29:36,876
[SPEAKER_19]: You ate him too.

299
00:29:38,223 --> 00:29:39,164
[SPEAKER_19]: And I'm grimacing.

300
00:29:39,204 --> 00:29:40,024
[SPEAKER_19]: These are gross.

301
00:29:40,084 --> 00:29:41,185
[SPEAKER_19]: How can you... Ugh!

302
00:29:41,865 --> 00:29:42,526
[SPEAKER_30]: Oh, God!

303
00:29:44,407 --> 00:29:45,487
[SPEAKER_30]: Acquired taste, Robin.

304
00:29:45,547 --> 00:29:50,370
[SPEAKER_19]: And again, I'm also the same person who takes shots of, you know, maple syrup and eats rice.

305
00:29:51,191 --> 00:29:51,551
[SPEAKER_19]: Raw.

306
00:29:52,051 --> 00:29:52,852
[SPEAKER_19]: Without being cooked.

307
00:29:54,653 --> 00:29:57,475
[SPEAKER_20]: Oh, you also eat the top ramen just right out of the bag, uncooked, too.

308
00:29:57,515 --> 00:29:59,216
[SPEAKER_30]: That I can do, unfortunately.

309
00:29:59,396 --> 00:29:59,896
[SPEAKER_20]: Oh, God!

310
00:30:00,016 --> 00:30:00,857
[SPEAKER_20]: What is wrong with you people?

311
00:30:01,197 --> 00:30:01,597
[SPEAKER_30]: What?

312
00:30:02,278 --> 00:30:06,200
[SPEAKER_30]: I can do it, but, you know, I haven't... I haven't eaten it in a...

313
00:30:07,862 --> 00:30:09,163
[SPEAKER_30]: Okay, that I won't do.

314
00:30:09,823 --> 00:30:11,204
[SPEAKER_20]: Now my breast is going to smell like pork.

315
00:30:12,365 --> 00:30:15,888
[SPEAKER_19]: That bacon bit flavor is never going to leave your stomach.

316
00:30:16,888 --> 00:30:17,929
[SPEAKER_19]: That's one of the things about it.

317
00:30:18,489 --> 00:30:24,794
[SPEAKER_20]: Can't you just get some lettuce and some ranch dressing and then have yourself a salad and then put the bacon bits on the salad?

318
00:30:25,014 --> 00:30:26,295
[SPEAKER_19]: I fucking hate salad, dude.

319
00:30:26,415 --> 00:30:27,515
[SPEAKER_19]: Salad is nasty.

320
00:30:28,216 --> 00:30:28,916
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm sorry, man.

321
00:30:28,956 --> 00:30:33,319
[SPEAKER_19]: I cannot imagine eating grass or shrubbery or something like that.

322
00:30:33,699 --> 00:30:34,380
[SPEAKER_19]: That's just nasty.

323
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:35,140
[SPEAKER_20]: Bunnies do it.

324
00:30:35,180 --> 00:30:35,741
[SPEAKER_20]: Why can't you?

325
00:30:37,110 --> 00:30:38,932
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, but bunnies poop like crazy.

326
00:30:40,653 --> 00:30:42,435
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't fucking take shits like that.

327
00:30:46,559 --> 00:30:46,999
[SPEAKER_20]: I give up.

328
00:30:48,881 --> 00:30:50,022
[SPEAKER_19]: So anyways, um...

329
00:30:50,868 --> 00:30:52,349
[SPEAKER_19]: So yeah, my week was filled with that.

330
00:30:52,489 --> 00:31:01,537
[SPEAKER_19]: And then I got to play... I'm part of the Matrix Online Stress Test 1, which I might say that I'm never going to buy that fucking game because it's lame.

331
00:31:02,038 --> 00:31:03,319
[SPEAKER_19]: It's so awful.

332
00:31:03,759 --> 00:31:07,022
[SPEAKER_20]: I mean, granted, it looks... Don't you have some type of non-disclosure agreement?

333
00:31:07,302 --> 00:31:10,625
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh yeah, I won't tell you why it sucks, but I'm going to tell you that it sucks.

334
00:31:11,146 --> 00:31:13,548
[SPEAKER_19]: No, really, it... I...

335
00:31:14,702 --> 00:31:15,522
[SPEAKER_19]: I like the game.

336
00:31:15,542 --> 00:31:16,543
[SPEAKER_19]: I mean, it's pretty.

337
00:31:17,203 --> 00:31:21,865
[SPEAKER_19]: And the idea, like, they have with, you know, the music where it's dynamic to what you're doing.

338
00:31:21,925 --> 00:31:23,026
[SPEAKER_19]: It changes and that kind of thing.

339
00:31:23,066 --> 00:31:23,706
[SPEAKER_19]: That's cool.

340
00:31:24,666 --> 00:31:26,787
[SPEAKER_19]: But I don't know what the fuck I'm doing at all.

341
00:31:26,927 --> 00:31:31,189
[SPEAKER_19]: I, like, got in there and I'm like, um, yeah.

342
00:31:32,010 --> 00:31:33,330
[SPEAKER_19]: And you just kind of run around.

343
00:31:33,370 --> 00:31:38,332
[SPEAKER_19]: The fighting system's awkward and just... Well, now, wait.

344
00:31:38,552 --> 00:31:39,693
[SPEAKER_20]: I signed no agreements.

345
00:31:40,071 --> 00:31:48,198
[SPEAKER_20]: and I happen to see a friend playing this game so I could express my comments because I'm not holding no agreement.

346
00:31:48,538 --> 00:31:49,018
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't care.

347
00:31:49,058 --> 00:31:51,220
[SPEAKER_19]: They can fucking sue my ass.

348
00:31:51,260 --> 00:31:52,221
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't really give a shit.

349
00:31:52,241 --> 00:31:54,943
[SPEAKER_20]: They ain't gonna get anything.

350
00:31:54,983 --> 00:31:57,145
[SPEAKER_20]: We already talked about how much you make.

351
00:31:58,546 --> 00:32:00,107
[SPEAKER_20]: You certainly don't get paid for this show.

352
00:32:00,848 --> 00:32:01,508
[SPEAKER_19]: Exactly.

353
00:32:02,709 --> 00:32:05,872
[SPEAKER_19]: So, um... Yeah, um...

354
00:32:07,423 --> 00:32:09,104
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, it's not that great.

355
00:32:23,175 --> 00:32:27,698
[SPEAKER_19]: It looks better than I thought it was going to be, and it also, the graphics are pretty good.

356
00:32:28,319 --> 00:32:32,261
[SPEAKER_19]: The amount of, like, ways you can customize your character is pretty cool.

357
00:32:33,302 --> 00:32:38,085
[SPEAKER_19]: But, like, I did about six or seven of the missions, and I was bored out of my mind.

358
00:32:38,185 --> 00:32:39,366
[SPEAKER_19]: I'd only gotten to level two.

359
00:32:39,426 --> 00:32:41,567
[SPEAKER_19]: I had no idea how to level up on anything.

360
00:32:41,627 --> 00:32:42,768
[SPEAKER_20]: Did you get to do any bullet time?

361
00:32:43,388 --> 00:32:43,629
[SPEAKER_20]: No.

362
00:32:43,809 --> 00:32:45,150
[SPEAKER_20]: See, that's what everybody wants.

363
00:32:45,190 --> 00:32:45,990
[SPEAKER_20]: They want bullet time.

364
00:32:46,030 --> 00:32:46,611
[SPEAKER_20]: They want it now.

365
00:32:47,371 --> 00:32:48,652
[SPEAKER_19]: But the thing is, it's like,

366
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:51,041
[SPEAKER_19]: Well, actually, no, I take that back.

367
00:32:51,101 --> 00:32:53,363
[SPEAKER_19]: There was one move that I did, it's called Cheap Shot.

368
00:32:53,863 --> 00:32:57,085
[SPEAKER_19]: You kind of turn around and in bullet time you kick the guy in the nuts.

369
00:32:57,385 --> 00:32:57,826
[SPEAKER_14]: Cheap Shot 20.

370
00:32:58,546 --> 00:32:59,547
[SPEAKER_19]: So that was kind of cool.

371
00:32:59,567 --> 00:33:00,007
[SPEAKER_14]: Now you got me.

372
00:33:00,027 --> 00:33:05,311
[SPEAKER_19]: But, you know, other than that, it's just like I didn't really know how to, like, progress in the game.

373
00:33:05,331 --> 00:33:08,273
[SPEAKER_19]: Whereas Final Fantasy is pretty simple, you walk outside, kill shit.

374
00:33:09,273 --> 00:33:09,914
[SPEAKER_19]: Exactly.

375
00:33:09,934 --> 00:33:10,674
[SPEAKER_20]: You murder bunnies.

376
00:33:10,894 --> 00:33:15,778
[SPEAKER_19]: Like, I couldn't tell, exactly, I couldn't tell who was the NPCs, who were not the NPCs.

377
00:33:16,438 --> 00:33:17,239
[SPEAKER_19]: Who are the enemies?

378
00:33:17,319 --> 00:33:18,100
[SPEAKER_19]: Who could I fight?

379
00:33:18,420 --> 00:33:19,661
[SPEAKER_19]: What the hell the story was?

380
00:33:19,921 --> 00:33:21,142
[SPEAKER_19]: It's just, it was all confusing.

381
00:33:21,402 --> 00:33:23,544
[SPEAKER_19]: There was a tutorial that I did and I had to quit the game.

382
00:33:23,824 --> 00:33:26,026
[SPEAKER_19]: So then I couldn't go back to the tutorial again.

383
00:33:26,586 --> 00:33:32,111
[SPEAKER_19]: And it's just like, and then Morpheus drones on for about five minutes once you get in the game for the first time.

384
00:33:32,611 --> 00:33:35,614
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm just like, okay, I don't know what the hell's going on.

385
00:33:36,314 --> 00:33:36,935
[SPEAKER_19]: It was confusing.

386
00:33:37,455 --> 00:33:39,317
[SPEAKER_20]: So it was kind of like the second Matrix movie.

387
00:33:40,538 --> 00:33:43,300
[SPEAKER_19]: It's probably better than the second Matrix movie.

388
00:33:46,224 --> 00:33:46,584
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't know.

389
00:33:46,904 --> 00:33:47,905
[SPEAKER_19]: I'll probably play it again.

390
00:33:47,965 --> 00:33:49,886
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't really know when the stress test ends.

391
00:33:49,926 --> 00:33:51,748
[SPEAKER_19]: I think it's either this week or two weeks from now.

392
00:33:51,788 --> 00:33:52,388
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm not sure.

393
00:33:53,029 --> 00:33:56,731
[SPEAKER_20]: You know, I was actually watching TV last night and for some reason we have free HBO right now.

394
00:33:56,871 --> 00:34:00,934
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm not going to complain, but we have free HBO because I just by chance was channel surfing and I ended up on HBO.

395
00:34:01,314 --> 00:34:03,116
[SPEAKER_20]: And they were showing the second Matrix movie.

396
00:34:04,056 --> 00:34:07,279
[SPEAKER_20]: And so I started to watch it for like five minutes and I was like, I'm bored.

397
00:34:07,299 --> 00:34:07,819
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm going to bed.

398
00:34:10,961 --> 00:34:11,221
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah.

399
00:34:11,762 --> 00:34:13,583
[SPEAKER_19]: And I love, I don't know, it's just just

400
00:34:14,676 --> 00:34:42,130
[SPEAKER_19]: whatever, try it if you want but don't I'd recommend probably Final Fantasy I don't know if that was my first online game or whatever to get into I'd probably be confused it'd probably turn me off to online games it's very good if you're like a first person shooter type person and you're getting into online games that'd be the way to go because the controls are that of a first person shooter and so you'd probably feel right at home with that

401
00:34:42,523 --> 00:34:46,205
[SPEAKER_20]: So like if you're a Quake, Doom, Halo nut, maybe.

402
00:34:46,765 --> 00:34:48,026
[SPEAKER_20]: Alright, sounds good.

403
00:34:48,726 --> 00:34:52,628
[SPEAKER_20]: I was going to say... Ah, forget it.

404
00:34:53,208 --> 00:34:54,369
[SPEAKER_20]: Oh yeah, I know what I was going to say.

405
00:34:54,469 --> 00:34:56,389
[SPEAKER_20]: I still want to give World of Warcraft a fair shot.

406
00:34:56,670 --> 00:35:06,014
[SPEAKER_20]: I got to observe World of Warcraft a little bit, and it seemed interesting, but I wasn't like wowed.

407
00:35:07,120 --> 00:35:07,681
[SPEAKER_20]: Pun intended.

408
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:19,203
[SPEAKER_30]: Magus actually picked it up, so I've been watching him play it.

409
00:35:19,583 --> 00:35:20,203
[SPEAKER_20]: Does it look good?

410
00:35:20,643 --> 00:35:22,164
[SPEAKER_30]: Yeah, it looks good.

411
00:35:22,184 --> 00:35:23,245
[SPEAKER_30]: I mean, it's Blizzard.

412
00:35:23,645 --> 00:35:29,608
[SPEAKER_30]: But it was kind of funny, because he was killing stuff, and all of a sudden I hear Diablo 2 sounds, and I'm going, huh?

413
00:35:29,628 --> 00:35:31,689
[SPEAKER_30]: I turn around and I'm like, oh wait, Blizzard game.

414
00:35:32,930 --> 00:35:34,411
[SPEAKER_20]: So they just recycled the same effects.

415
00:35:34,431 --> 00:35:35,051
[SPEAKER_20]: Well, you know, whatever.

416
00:35:35,071 --> 00:35:37,512
[SPEAKER_30]: Kind of, sort of, yeah.

417
00:35:37,992 --> 00:35:42,795
[SPEAKER_30]: The characters don't look as pretty as Final Fantasy XI, because it's different, so...

418
00:35:44,504 --> 00:36:12,056
[SPEAKER_30]: about the only funny thing that I find actually amusing is like they can do like little dances and stuff no matter what you know depending on what race you choose that was hilarious like the what the dark undead guy can like rock out and stuff it's really funny you know what's interesting is the number one thing I hear about World of Warcraft is that they say it's more built for the casual player who wants to play by themself

419
00:36:12,506 --> 00:36:14,166
[SPEAKER_20]: and doesn't really want to party up a whole lot.

420
00:36:14,226 --> 00:36:21,168
[SPEAKER_20]: And my first reaction is, well, then why play a multiplayer massive online game if you want to play by yourself?

421
00:36:23,129 --> 00:36:24,149
[SPEAKER_20]: That's the part I don't get.

422
00:36:24,269 --> 00:36:26,209
[SPEAKER_19]: But other than that... Because here's why.

423
00:36:26,229 --> 00:36:32,851
[SPEAKER_19]: Because when you get down to Final Fantasy or whatever in the higher levels, if you don't find a party, you're stuck.

424
00:36:32,911 --> 00:36:35,091
[SPEAKER_19]: You're just sitting there for hours doing nothing.

425
00:36:35,652 --> 00:36:37,292
[SPEAKER_19]: And that's why.

426
00:36:38,615 --> 00:36:40,435
[SPEAKER_19]: People will get turned off by that kind of crap.

427
00:36:40,636 --> 00:36:44,056
[SPEAKER_19]: Because they don't, you know, obviously, you know, they could be doing thousands of others.

428
00:36:44,076 --> 00:36:45,957
[SPEAKER_19]: You can find things to do even when you're high level.

429
00:36:45,977 --> 00:36:56,940
[SPEAKER_19]: You can find things to do, but people want to be leveling up, and they can't do that by... Because you could do, you know, in Final Fantasy XI, you could do sin thing, you could do gardening, but, you know, people don't want to...

430
00:37:05,482 --> 00:37:05,842
[SPEAKER_19]: DarkSakura.com

431
00:37:28,540 --> 00:37:30,721
[SPEAKER_20]: Let's move on, and Explicit joined us.

432
00:37:30,781 --> 00:37:35,144
[SPEAKER_20]: He snuck in through the door while we were talking there a little bit ago.

433
00:37:35,204 --> 00:37:36,104
[SPEAKER_20]: So how you doing, Explicit?

434
00:37:37,825 --> 00:37:39,986
[SPEAKER_26]: Pretty okay for the whole week.

435
00:37:40,186 --> 00:37:42,247
[SPEAKER_20]: Well, I was going to ask, how was your week, how was your day, sir?

436
00:37:42,948 --> 00:37:54,774
[SPEAKER_26]: Well, this whole week's been hell, been pretty much hell, due to all of unnecessary drama that's been shoved in my face the whole week.

437
00:37:56,588 --> 00:37:58,970
[SPEAKER_26]: Special, like, right after the tournament, of course.

438
00:37:59,571 --> 00:38:01,112
[SPEAKER_20]: How did things go at the tournament, by the way?

439
00:38:01,372 --> 00:38:09,820
[SPEAKER_26]: Okay, like, during the tournament, it went very well, because, like, I mean, we had the speakers and had the microphones to talk to people and what they think about the tournament so far.

440
00:38:11,141 --> 00:38:12,222
[SPEAKER_26]: And it seems pretty fair.

441
00:38:12,242 --> 00:38:13,703
[SPEAKER_26]: I mean, a lot of people had fun and stuff.

442
00:38:14,684 --> 00:38:16,525
[SPEAKER_26]: But, of course, we always get the bad news.

443
00:38:16,806 --> 00:38:18,647
[SPEAKER_26]: Of course, we all know, drama.

444
00:38:19,848 --> 00:38:21,149
[SPEAKER_20]: Drama, drama revolution.

445
00:38:21,189 --> 00:38:22,250
[SPEAKER_20]: Where would we be without it?

446
00:38:22,470 --> 00:38:22,931
[SPEAKER_26]: Yeah.

447
00:38:23,539 --> 00:38:28,845
[SPEAKER_26]: Unfortunately, we get somebody who was bitching about, bitching the whole time.

448
00:38:29,946 --> 00:38:34,051
[SPEAKER_26]: I'm like, and trying to get into the faces of the people calculating the scores.

449
00:38:34,952 --> 00:38:37,495
[SPEAKER_26]: Okay, let us, first of all, let us do our jobs.

450
00:38:38,456 --> 00:38:39,898
[SPEAKER_26]: Don't come around bitching and bitching.

451
00:38:40,038 --> 00:38:42,681
[SPEAKER_26]: I understand you drove like three hours away from home.

452
00:38:43,291 --> 00:38:43,371
[SPEAKER_26]: Hmm.

453
00:38:58,506 --> 00:39:08,055
[SPEAKER_26]: Of course, you get people bitching about, some people bitching about the pad issues, which is, which is starting to be common in every tournament, since B3 maybe.

454
00:39:08,836 --> 00:39:14,120
[SPEAKER_26]: Where someone like, bitch about, oh, I got a great, we should do a doober because the arrow's not working.

455
00:39:15,962 --> 00:39:17,003
[SPEAKER_20]: No, the player's not working.

456
00:39:18,144 --> 00:39:18,384
[SPEAKER_26]: Obviously.

457
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:25,504
[SPEAKER_26]: It happened in Sunnyvale Golf Land 3 numerous times where everyone had to play one pad because the left side is not working.

458
00:39:25,785 --> 00:39:27,225
[SPEAKER_20]: I heard you took my suggestion though.

459
00:39:27,286 --> 00:39:37,252
[SPEAKER_20]: I heard that you actually made them all sign a form that says the rules are final and pad disputes will be... I heard that you made everybody sign a form.

460
00:39:37,292 --> 00:39:37,752
[SPEAKER_26]: Yes, I did.

461
00:39:37,992 --> 00:39:38,293
[SPEAKER_20]: Good.

462
00:39:38,393 --> 00:39:38,913
[SPEAKER_20]: Good for you.

463
00:39:39,553 --> 00:39:44,457
[SPEAKER_26]: Unfortunately, some people went out of the barrier.

464
00:39:44,777 --> 00:39:45,457
[SPEAKER_26]: Look what happened.

465
00:39:45,497 --> 00:39:46,298
[SPEAKER_26]: They got kicked out.

466
00:39:47,644 --> 00:39:49,306
[SPEAKER_26]: The one person got kicked out of the tournament.

467
00:39:49,987 --> 00:39:52,790
[SPEAKER_26]: See this is what happens if you start drama.

468
00:39:52,830 --> 00:39:56,313
[SPEAKER_26]: Before the tournament you should have asked me questions personally and during the forums.

469
00:39:56,994 --> 00:40:00,337
[SPEAKER_26]: I'll see what I can do with the solution so it doesn't become a rush hour.

470
00:40:01,849 --> 00:40:07,812
[SPEAKER_20]: I think there should be a settlement process if there is reasonable doubt that the machine's malfunctioning.

471
00:40:07,852 --> 00:40:11,194
[SPEAKER_20]: But what that exactly is, does it take two people bitching?

472
00:40:11,234 --> 00:40:12,695
[SPEAKER_20]: Does it take whatever?

473
00:40:12,715 --> 00:40:15,396
[SPEAKER_20]: And then what's the process to review the machine?

474
00:40:15,436 --> 00:40:17,117
[SPEAKER_20]: You've got to set that all up in advance.

475
00:40:17,157 --> 00:40:18,958
[SPEAKER_20]: I think once a reasonable process is established...

476
00:40:19,912 --> 00:40:23,134
[SPEAKER_20]: There's really no way you can complain about it.

477
00:40:23,354 --> 00:40:29,637
[SPEAKER_26]: It's a little debatable because sometimes the techs are not there to help buy the parts.

478
00:40:29,677 --> 00:40:34,460
[SPEAKER_26]: You know, each arrow has four sensors itself.

479
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:43,805
[SPEAKER_26]: And buying 32 parts in case one of them goes dead is not really a reasonable solution because you're spending a lot of money itself because you're going to owe the whole...

480
00:40:44,716 --> 00:40:46,917
[SPEAKER_26]: Like vendors, money, because they're spending parts on this.

481
00:40:47,937 --> 00:40:51,658
[SPEAKER_26]: So you're basically going to be left in a deficit like right after the whole tournament is over.

482
00:40:53,319 --> 00:41:03,702
[SPEAKER_20]: The sad thing is you could bring a brand new pad in there, brand spanking new pad, and somehow it's possible it could get fucked up during the tournament and it would not work.

483
00:41:03,923 --> 00:41:11,265
[SPEAKER_20]: So you just have to, I don't know, you just sometimes have to just bite the bullet and accept that things aren't always going to work perfectly at the tournament.

484
00:41:11,775 --> 00:41:17,937
[SPEAKER_26]: Yeah, I mean, I understand that, but, I mean, this is why, like, in my opinion, I'm not trying to say, like, it's, like, unacceptable, as some people might say.

485
00:41:18,717 --> 00:41:23,758
[SPEAKER_26]: Some people also have to check on player styles, like, sort of like freestyle in a way.

486
00:41:23,778 --> 00:41:28,359
[SPEAKER_26]: You have to figure out ways to make sure you get the perfects, rather than just try to cheat your way.

487
00:41:28,379 --> 00:41:31,960
[SPEAKER_26]: I mean, here's a question.

488
00:41:32,040 --> 00:41:32,880
[SPEAKER_26]: What would you rather have?

489
00:41:33,380 --> 00:41:37,701
[SPEAKER_26]: Someone who would accept defeat, or someone who would actually pitch too much so they can get a do-over in favor?

490
00:41:38,061 --> 00:41:39,962
[SPEAKER_26]: They're part of the tournament, so they can move up.

491
00:41:40,283 --> 00:41:44,725
[SPEAKER_20]: Someone who takes the defeat and takes the criticism on how to get better, of course.

492
00:41:45,427 --> 00:42:01,739
[SPEAKER_26]: Yeah, unfortunately, it comes to a point where, oh my god, like, here's an example, like, one of the rounds, I think, somebody got, the person, like, I'm not gonna say any names, the person got, like, 13 grades, and then he claims that he got 3 grades on that song.

493
00:42:03,480 --> 00:42:06,783
[SPEAKER_26]: Unfortunately, he said, oh my god, I got 10 grades on the same arrow.

494
00:42:07,724 --> 00:42:11,306
[SPEAKER_26]: We checked his playstyle, he's been getting the grades on the wrong arrow.

495
00:42:14,048 --> 00:42:14,609
[SPEAKER_20]: Interesting.

496
00:42:15,680 --> 00:42:17,861
[SPEAKER_26]: Yeah, and then of course you've got the rules.

497
00:42:18,902 --> 00:42:22,264
[SPEAKER_26]: Like I said before, they should have asked beforehand so we could come up with solutions.

498
00:42:23,145 --> 00:42:29,809
[SPEAKER_26]: I mean, Tony did it, or should I say Andrew, he was worried about putting suggestions about dark mode.

499
00:42:30,329 --> 00:42:33,951
[SPEAKER_26]: I added another option, which is one speed.

500
00:42:34,311 --> 00:42:34,952
[SPEAKER_22]: Right.

501
00:42:35,052 --> 00:42:35,792
[SPEAKER_26]: One of the two ways.

502
00:42:36,072 --> 00:42:36,253
[SPEAKER_22]: Right.

503
00:42:36,293 --> 00:42:36,813
[SPEAKER_26]: I'm not going to make it...

504
00:42:37,313 --> 00:42:38,934
[SPEAKER_26]: The tournament's more like an advanced format.

505
00:42:38,954 --> 00:42:42,336
[SPEAKER_26]: It's not really like the same traditional format like everyone thinks it is.

506
00:42:43,277 --> 00:42:48,860
[SPEAKER_26]: I'm thinking about using a traditional so people do... It'll cause less bitching for tournaments.

507
00:42:49,120 --> 00:42:51,882
[SPEAKER_26]: Or cancel singles PA overall.

508
00:42:51,922 --> 00:43:01,568
[SPEAKER_20]: Well, you know, you gotta just... It's one of those things where I think it gets to a point where if the rules are gonna be outside the box a little bit, then if you're a competitor, you gotta review the rules, and if it's not for you, don't enter.

509
00:43:02,408 --> 00:43:03,629
[SPEAKER_20]: Wait for the next tournament.

510
00:43:03,649 --> 00:43:06,731
[SPEAKER_26]: I mean, look... I'm not trying to blame...

511
00:43:07,130 --> 00:43:07,490
[SPEAKER_20]: DarkReverse

512
00:43:29,777 --> 00:43:41,789
[SPEAKER_20]: And the complaints were kind of minimal on it, because we outlined the rules in advance and said, here are the songs, and you'll have to do it dark or verse, and if you don't like it, don't enter.

513
00:43:41,809 --> 00:43:44,631
[SPEAKER_26]: The thing is, I released the songs during the tournament.

514
00:43:45,352 --> 00:43:50,997
[SPEAKER_26]: I said in the rules completely that the songs are going to be released during the tournament.

515
00:43:51,538 --> 00:43:54,541
[SPEAKER_26]: There are 16 songs to choose from, from easy to hard.

516
00:43:55,086 --> 00:44:00,270
[SPEAKER_20]: We did this really weird setup, and I wish I could find those rules again, because I think they're actually pretty good.

517
00:44:00,571 --> 00:44:12,621
[SPEAKER_20]: But it was like, you could choose a song from list A, B, or C, and B would keep your score even, A would reduce your score automatically by a little bit, because they were easier songs, and C would increase your score by a little bit, because they were like 9-footers and hard songs.

518
00:44:12,641 --> 00:44:13,641
[SPEAKER_26]: Yeah, I know that system.

519
00:44:13,682 --> 00:44:14,943
[SPEAKER_26]: You guys did a teeter system.

520
00:44:15,043 --> 00:44:15,703
[SPEAKER_26]: Yeah.

521
00:44:15,783 --> 00:44:18,145
[SPEAKER_26]: I mean, that was a system that worked very well.

522
00:44:18,486 --> 00:44:19,807
[SPEAKER_26]: I was thinking about using it for...

523
00:44:20,908 --> 00:44:21,729
[SPEAKER_26]: By pissing all over it.

524
00:44:39,568 --> 00:44:59,860
[SPEAKER_26]: and of course you see TOs quitting tournaments because of it because they can't handle the situation and this is where I came in and take some numerous action eliminating the pests alright well anything else in your week outside the tournament how else was your week and stuff

525
00:45:01,277 --> 00:45:03,899
[SPEAKER_26]: Okay, I'll explain some more of the tournament later, like probably my FUs.

526
00:45:03,999 --> 00:45:04,240
[SPEAKER_20]: Okay.

527
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:05,741
[SPEAKER_26]: Well, it's been hell.

528
00:45:06,602 --> 00:45:13,267
[SPEAKER_26]: And, oh yeah, of course, everyone knows about Ash Wednesday, where they had to sacrifice something for 40 days and 40 nights.

529
00:45:13,587 --> 00:45:14,148
[SPEAKER_20]: Oh yeah, Lent.

530
00:45:14,388 --> 00:45:15,129
[SPEAKER_20]: Okay.

531
00:45:15,329 --> 00:45:15,809
[SPEAKER_26]: I got a question.

532
00:45:15,829 --> 00:45:17,691
[SPEAKER_26]: Did anybody sacrifice anything for Lent?

533
00:45:18,572 --> 00:45:20,133
[SPEAKER_20]: I sacrificed going to church.

534
00:45:21,014 --> 00:45:21,354
[SPEAKER_26]: Wow.

535
00:45:22,415 --> 00:45:22,955
[SPEAKER_26]: Wow.

536
00:45:27,354 --> 00:45:31,616
[SPEAKER_20]: And all due respect, it's not my cup of tea for that stuff.

537
00:45:31,716 --> 00:45:35,178
[SPEAKER_20]: So no, I don't celebrate Lent.

538
00:45:36,558 --> 00:45:37,179
[SPEAKER_20]: What'd you give up?

539
00:45:38,099 --> 00:45:43,862
[SPEAKER_26]: It's pretty ashamed to say on Orange Lounge Radio, but I'll say it right now.

540
00:45:43,982 --> 00:45:44,202
[SPEAKER_20]: What?

541
00:45:44,422 --> 00:45:46,643
[SPEAKER_26]: I sacrificed getting a boner for Lent.

542
00:45:47,403 --> 00:45:48,424
[SPEAKER_20]: Wait, wait, wait.

543
00:45:48,484 --> 00:45:50,405
[SPEAKER_20]: You sacrificed getting a boner.

544
00:45:50,885 --> 00:45:52,866
[SPEAKER_20]: You're not allowed to get a boner for the next 40 days.

545
00:45:52,886 --> 00:45:53,106
[SPEAKER_26]: Yes.

546
00:45:56,616 --> 00:45:58,998
[SPEAKER_19]: I sacrifice masturbating with my left hand.

547
00:45:59,398 --> 00:46:01,620
[SPEAKER_19]: It's strictly right hand from now on.

548
00:46:02,260 --> 00:46:03,501
[SPEAKER_20]: Wait, wait, wait.

549
00:46:03,541 --> 00:46:06,563
[SPEAKER_20]: What are you going to do if that hot Asian girl with big boobs walks by?

550
00:46:06,603 --> 00:46:09,885
[SPEAKER_20]: Are you just going to look the other way real quick before dirty thoughts?

551
00:46:09,985 --> 00:46:10,586
[SPEAKER_26]: I've found ways.

552
00:46:10,606 --> 00:46:17,290
[SPEAKER_26]: I'm drinking a lot of water to gulp down and... It's a tough decision.

553
00:46:17,350 --> 00:46:20,532
[SPEAKER_26]: It's basically a land that no man has gone before.

554
00:46:20,552 --> 00:46:20,752
[SPEAKER_26]: Wait...

555
00:46:21,926 --> 00:46:23,127
[SPEAKER_20]: You gotta tape it down.

556
00:46:23,988 --> 00:46:29,232
[SPEAKER_20]: That's what you're gonna have to do, is you're going to have to tuck your penis back and make yourself have a vagina.

557
00:46:29,272 --> 00:46:31,994
[SPEAKER_20]: That's the only way you're gonna stop getting a boner all together.

558
00:46:32,054 --> 00:46:33,855
[SPEAKER_29]: Oh boy, he really wants one of those!

559
00:46:33,955 --> 00:46:36,758
[SPEAKER_19]: Even that is not, you know, foolproof either, I mean.

560
00:46:38,719 --> 00:46:45,965
[SPEAKER_19]: That is like, I'd like to compare it to like the octopus, you know, where you have multiple brains, you know, octopuses, octopi have...

561
00:46:46,798 --> 00:46:52,663
[SPEAKER_19]: multiple brains, they have brains that control their feet, or their tentacles, or whatever, and, you know, their normal brain.

562
00:46:53,843 --> 00:46:59,748
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm sorry, but once that signal, once you see, once Hot Girl's signal has gone down to their brain, it's all over.

563
00:46:59,828 --> 00:47:03,891
[SPEAKER_20]: What are you going to do if you wake up in the morning, and then you're like, Oh, fuck!

564
00:47:04,852 --> 00:47:05,693
[SPEAKER_20]: God hates me!

565
00:47:05,813 --> 00:47:06,473
[SPEAKER_20]: What are you going to do?

566
00:47:07,174 --> 00:47:08,315
[SPEAKER_26]: So, wait, here's the thing.

567
00:47:08,355 --> 00:47:09,856
[SPEAKER_26]: So far, I've actually survived.

568
00:47:10,276 --> 00:47:11,477
[SPEAKER_26]: I'm not going to need a boner.

569
00:47:12,078 --> 00:47:13,779
[SPEAKER_26]: I've seen attractive women, but no boner.

570
00:47:15,484 --> 00:47:17,145
[SPEAKER_26]: and I woke up, no boner.

571
00:47:17,505 --> 00:47:18,826
[SPEAKER_26]: I took a piss, no boner.

572
00:47:22,287 --> 00:47:23,688
[SPEAKER_20]: Does like a semi count?

573
00:47:25,009 --> 00:47:27,790
[SPEAKER_26]: And here's the thing, no, I'm not taking any anti-viagra.

574
00:47:30,271 --> 00:47:30,792
[SPEAKER_21]: Wow.

575
00:47:31,212 --> 00:47:31,772
[SPEAKER_21]: Wow.

576
00:47:32,333 --> 00:47:37,855
[SPEAKER_26]: So yes, it's a challenge, but I'm living up to my word, no boner for the next 40 days.

577
00:47:38,175 --> 00:47:40,277
[SPEAKER_20]: I hate to say it, but keep us posted.

578
00:47:41,317 --> 00:47:42,057
[SPEAKER_26]: It's on my LJ.

579
00:47:42,958 --> 00:47:43,378
[SPEAKER_20]: Alright.

580
00:47:44,158 --> 00:47:45,099
[SPEAKER_26]: For those who want to check out

581
00:47:46,217 --> 00:47:55,323
[SPEAKER_20]: You know if he comes back here on day 39, I'm going to have like the rotating, you know, big-titted Asian prawn hentai, everything going on the screen in here.

582
00:47:55,443 --> 00:47:59,186
[SPEAKER_19]: I should have like a sign that says, you know, gone this many days without wood.

583
00:48:02,768 --> 00:48:03,189
[SPEAKER_20]: Wow.

584
00:48:04,790 --> 00:48:05,230
[SPEAKER_20]: Amazing.

585
00:48:08,752 --> 00:48:09,093
[SPEAKER_20]: Alright.

586
00:48:10,273 --> 00:48:10,634
[SPEAKER_20]: My way...

587
00:48:15,615 --> 00:48:20,257
[SPEAKER_20]: I could take that down the gutter even further, but for the sake of humanity, I'm not going to.

588
00:48:21,177 --> 00:48:21,978
[SPEAKER_20]: Good luck, my friend.

589
00:48:22,018 --> 00:48:22,358
[SPEAKER_20]: Good luck.

590
00:48:22,458 --> 00:48:23,098
[SPEAKER_20]: That's all I have to say.

591
00:48:23,118 --> 00:48:23,458
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh, come on, man.

592
00:48:23,498 --> 00:48:24,519
[SPEAKER_19]: We need time to kill.

593
00:48:25,059 --> 00:48:25,599
[SPEAKER_20]: No, it's all right.

594
00:48:25,639 --> 00:48:25,999
[SPEAKER_20]: It's all right.

595
00:48:26,339 --> 00:48:26,719
[SPEAKER_20]: Trust me.

596
00:48:26,899 --> 00:48:27,640
[SPEAKER_20]: You don't want me to go there.

597
00:48:31,761 --> 00:48:34,242
[SPEAKER_20]: Sorry, I'm having a comedy show in my mind.

598
00:48:34,282 --> 00:48:35,943
[SPEAKER_20]: This is why we'll never make it.

599
00:48:36,543 --> 00:48:37,023
[SPEAKER_20]: Seriously.

600
00:48:41,471 --> 00:48:43,515
[SPEAKER_20]: The folks from Satellite Radio are listening right now.

601
00:48:43,615 --> 00:48:50,026
[SPEAKER_20]: Oh, we just found out about this program that's all about gaming and these people here are all into gaming and they've done it for years.

602
00:48:50,046 --> 00:48:50,868
[SPEAKER_20]: They've got to be good at this.

603
00:48:51,389 --> 00:48:52,090
[SPEAKER_20]: Now they're tuning in.

604
00:48:53,007 --> 00:48:54,828
[SPEAKER_20]: You're going to get a boner in 40 days.

605
00:48:54,848 --> 00:48:56,528
[SPEAKER_20]: You can't go 40 days without a boner.

606
00:48:56,728 --> 00:48:58,669
[SPEAKER_20]: We're going to put big-titted women on the screen.

607
00:48:58,909 --> 00:49:11,634
[SPEAKER_19]: To tell you how much G4 has sold out to just, you know, selling everything with sex on their damn station, because that's, I guess, the only way they think it's going to work, they're going to have some football game coverage featuring the Lingerie Bowl girls.

608
00:49:13,455 --> 00:49:14,395
[SPEAKER_20]: Oh, yeah, that's game-related.

609
00:49:15,176 --> 00:49:15,436
[SPEAKER_20]: Oh, yeah.

610
00:49:18,317 --> 00:49:20,298
[SPEAKER_20]: Is that the tech TV part of the station?

611
00:49:20,518 --> 00:49:20,538
[SPEAKER_20]: I...

612
00:49:22,546 --> 00:49:22,786
[SPEAKER_17]: Anyway.

613
00:49:23,447 --> 00:49:24,888
[SPEAKER_20]: No, no, see, you forget.

614
00:49:25,008 --> 00:49:27,090
[SPEAKER_20]: Tech TV's no longer part of the station.

615
00:49:27,250 --> 00:49:28,371
[SPEAKER_20]: Oh, my bad, my bad.

616
00:49:29,733 --> 00:49:30,053
[SPEAKER_20]: Anyway.

617
00:49:31,969 --> 00:49:34,211
[SPEAKER_20]: My week and my day, since we didn't get around to it yet.

618
00:49:34,691 --> 00:49:36,053
[SPEAKER_20]: My week and my day were pretty good.

619
00:49:36,633 --> 00:49:40,256
[SPEAKER_20]: I went out to the clubs last night, you know, shaking my thing.

620
00:49:40,296 --> 00:49:43,159
[SPEAKER_20]: And it's so hilarious when you hear DDR songs at the club.

621
00:49:43,659 --> 00:49:49,925
[SPEAKER_20]: I know I'm such a loser for thinking that, but you know, we were dancing in the room where all the videos come on.

622
00:49:50,205 --> 00:49:52,928
[SPEAKER_20]: And they played shiny disco balls, you know, from Ultramix.

623
00:49:54,309 --> 00:49:58,913
[SPEAKER_20]: And I just... To illusion in the chat room, we call those weekdays.

624
00:50:14,191 --> 00:50:20,055
[SPEAKER_19]: Loki should have a spin-off show where he feels on big-breasted Asian girls and shouts racial slurs for two straight hours.

625
00:50:20,696 --> 00:50:21,757
[SPEAKER_19]: I call those weekdays.

626
00:50:22,817 --> 00:50:23,578
[SPEAKER_20]: Alright, alright.

627
00:50:24,018 --> 00:50:25,199
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm sorry, Explosive, you were saying?

628
00:50:25,719 --> 00:50:29,342
[SPEAKER_26]: Speaking of that, guess what I heard on 24 Hour Fitness when I was working out?

629
00:50:30,512 --> 00:50:31,793
[SPEAKER_26]: Someone actually played... Butterfly.

630
00:50:32,013 --> 00:50:32,193
[SPEAKER_26]: No.

631
00:50:33,174 --> 00:50:33,995
[SPEAKER_26]: Era from TAC.

632
00:50:34,695 --> 00:50:34,995
[SPEAKER_26]: What?

633
00:50:35,396 --> 00:50:36,136
[SPEAKER_26]: I'm serious.

634
00:50:36,456 --> 00:50:40,699
[SPEAKER_26]: I was working out with the weights, and I heard Era.

635
00:50:40,719 --> 00:50:42,981
[SPEAKER_26]: I'm like, what the fuck?

636
00:50:44,482 --> 00:50:46,263
[SPEAKER_20]: On like the 24... What do they have in there?

637
00:50:46,283 --> 00:50:48,925
[SPEAKER_20]: Like a 24-hour fitness radio station or music?

638
00:50:48,945 --> 00:50:49,766
[SPEAKER_26]: No, they play it regular.

639
00:50:49,786 --> 00:50:54,429
[SPEAKER_26]: They play any songs that people put in their music box and play it all.

640
00:50:54,790 --> 00:50:59,273
[SPEAKER_26]: They play like some of the stuff from DDR Max, like Sandstorm or...

641
00:51:00,828 --> 00:51:04,489
[SPEAKER_20]: I know that Jamie had burned a CD for her spin group.

642
00:51:04,629 --> 00:51:05,850
[SPEAKER_20]: They do the bike spin thing.

643
00:51:06,350 --> 00:51:08,010
[SPEAKER_20]: But I don't know how many Bomani Shants she put on.

644
00:51:08,030 --> 00:51:10,191
[SPEAKER_20]: I think it was mostly like top 40 junk.

645
00:51:10,531 --> 00:51:13,732
[SPEAKER_20]: And this was funny to burn one of these CDs for Jamie to have to make her, you know.

646
00:51:13,932 --> 00:51:15,513
[SPEAKER_20]: But they had to get something that was friendly to everybody.

647
00:51:15,533 --> 00:51:20,774
[SPEAKER_20]: She's like, and of course she comes to me, Rob, do you have Toxic by Britney?

648
00:51:20,794 --> 00:51:23,555
[SPEAKER_26]: Oh, wait a minute, wait a minute.

649
00:51:23,575 --> 00:51:23,995
[SPEAKER_20]: What, what?

650
00:51:24,376 --> 00:51:25,456
[SPEAKER_26]: I see a comment about...

651
00:51:27,883 --> 00:51:28,503
[SPEAKER_26]: laugh out loud.

652
00:51:28,543 --> 00:51:31,605
[SPEAKER_26]: It's even more crazy to see someone doing DDR steps in clubs.

653
00:51:31,645 --> 00:51:32,626
[SPEAKER_20]: I was just getting to that.

654
00:51:32,686 --> 00:51:38,730
[SPEAKER_20]: When Shiny Disco Balls came on, I was kind of like dancing like, disco, disco, disco, like doing the little steps.

655
00:51:38,750 --> 00:51:56,083
[SPEAKER_26]: Speaking of that, speaking of that, okay, this is, speaking of, speaking relating to the tournament, I know it's over, but I found out the reason why someone wanted to win first place was to take this girl to this junior prom and to realize, I would, I would imagine if he does DDR in a freaking prom.

656
00:51:57,119 --> 00:51:57,900
[SPEAKER_20]: Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

657
00:51:58,560 --> 00:52:02,543
[SPEAKER_20]: Some guy wanted to win the tournament because if he won the tournament... Like money and stuff?

658
00:52:03,404 --> 00:52:04,004
[SPEAKER_20]: Oh, okay.

659
00:52:04,044 --> 00:52:06,626
[SPEAKER_20]: I thought the girl wouldn't date him unless he won the tournament type thing.

660
00:52:06,646 --> 00:52:07,487
[SPEAKER_25]: I know the girl, too.

661
00:52:07,807 --> 00:52:09,428
[SPEAKER_20]: Oh, okay.

662
00:52:09,448 --> 00:52:15,433
[SPEAKER_20]: That's a really bad setup for like DDR Freak the movie, you know, like... Never mind.

663
00:52:15,753 --> 00:52:17,374
[SPEAKER_26]: Yeah, you know, this is ridiculous.

664
00:52:17,414 --> 00:52:19,476
[SPEAKER_26]: It's very sad, but true.

665
00:52:19,496 --> 00:52:19,576
[SPEAKER_19]: True.

666
00:52:21,616 --> 00:52:26,458
[SPEAKER_19]: You basically have to rip off the whole storyline for 10K Commotion.

667
00:52:26,758 --> 00:52:29,339
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm not having another DDR Freak movie discussion.

668
00:52:30,419 --> 00:52:31,920
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm not having it again on the show.

669
00:52:31,940 --> 00:52:33,701
[SPEAKER_19]: You should be 10K Commotion the movie.

670
00:52:33,741 --> 00:52:35,041
[SPEAKER_19]: That would be the only way it would work.

671
00:52:35,581 --> 00:52:35,981
[SPEAKER_19]: Only way.

672
00:52:36,482 --> 00:52:37,142
[SPEAKER_19]: No other way.

673
00:52:37,442 --> 00:52:41,423
[SPEAKER_19]: None of this robot chick Asian person dancer.

674
00:52:41,904 --> 00:52:42,084
[SPEAKER_19]: No.

675
00:52:42,584 --> 00:52:43,544
[SPEAKER_20]: Can I talk about my week?

676
00:52:44,945 --> 00:52:45,305
[SPEAKER_19]: I guess.

677
00:52:45,405 --> 00:52:45,685
[SPEAKER_20]: All right.

678
00:52:46,331 --> 00:53:11,769
[SPEAKER_20]: So, Friday night I was hanging out with some friends and we went over to Rice Princess' house, you know, the one from Outside the Box, although we haven't really done Outside the Box in several weeks, which I apologize for, but, you know, there's just been other circumstances coming up and the show may be moved or retooled in the near future, so I appreciate those of you guys who are bearing with us, but we just have a lot of other crap that's been getting in the way, so something might change with that.

679
00:53:11,849 --> 00:53:14,291
[SPEAKER_20]: Anyway, but as far as

680
00:53:14,711 --> 00:53:15,631
[SPEAKER_20]: Friday nights go.

681
00:53:15,872 --> 00:53:22,214
[SPEAKER_20]: I saw, for the very first time in my life, and I know this is hard to believe, I had never seen The Fifth Element before, the movie.

682
00:53:22,514 --> 00:53:23,555
[SPEAKER_20]: I finally saw it Friday night.

683
00:53:25,256 --> 00:53:28,577
[SPEAKER_20]: It was very gay, really.

684
00:53:30,398 --> 00:53:31,919
[SPEAKER_20]: Like the costumes and everything.

685
00:53:32,559 --> 00:53:34,020
[SPEAKER_20]: No, I don't know how to describe it.

686
00:53:34,200 --> 00:53:35,340
[SPEAKER_20]: It was alright, I guess.

687
00:53:35,660 --> 00:53:41,563
[SPEAKER_20]: Although, the thing I thought was kind of cool about The Fifth Element was that it was kind of like a video game plot.

688
00:53:42,143 --> 00:53:42,703
[SPEAKER_20]: It really was.

689
00:53:42,763 --> 00:53:44,164
[SPEAKER_20]: It was a total video game plot.

690
00:53:45,916 --> 00:53:48,398
[SPEAKER_20]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

691
00:54:06,044 --> 00:54:07,706
[SPEAKER_20]: We're going to look at the other half now.

692
00:54:07,766 --> 00:54:11,970
[SPEAKER_20]: We did some, you know, happy, lovey-dovey songs in the first break.

693
00:54:12,030 --> 00:54:16,414
[SPEAKER_20]: Now we're going to do some angry songs for Singles Awareness Day.

694
00:54:16,714 --> 00:54:17,495
[SPEAKER_20]: Some anger.

695
00:54:18,415 --> 00:54:21,318
[SPEAKER_26]: Speaking of Valentine's Day as well, coming up.

696
00:54:21,939 --> 00:54:22,179
[SPEAKER_20]: What?

697
00:54:22,639 --> 00:54:23,200
[SPEAKER_20]: A quick thought?

698
00:54:23,660 --> 00:54:23,921
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah?

699
00:54:24,241 --> 00:54:25,502
[SPEAKER_20]: Are you doing anything for Valentine's Day?

700
00:54:25,782 --> 00:54:27,124
[SPEAKER_20]: Unfortunately, no.

701
00:54:27,284 --> 00:54:28,925
[SPEAKER_20]: It's a good thing, or else you might get a boner.

702
00:54:29,846 --> 00:54:30,747
[SPEAKER_26]: Oh, yeah, that's true.

703
00:54:31,468 --> 00:54:31,928
[SPEAKER_26]: That is true.

704
00:54:32,358 --> 00:54:38,343
[SPEAKER_26]: Oh wait, wait, actually no, that'll make it worse because I gotta work after school and... Yeah.

705
00:54:38,803 --> 00:54:39,144
[SPEAKER_26]: Alright.

706
00:54:39,224 --> 00:54:40,705
[SPEAKER_26]: Deal with people smooching.

707
00:54:42,747 --> 00:54:45,589
[SPEAKER_26]: Each and every time.

708
00:54:45,669 --> 00:54:47,050
[SPEAKER_26]: The desire is increasing.

709
00:54:48,011 --> 00:54:49,633
[SPEAKER_20]: Alright, we'll be back after this.

710
00:54:49,653 --> 00:54:56,218
[SPEAKER_20]: We're gonna start it off with an angry Korean, and then we'll be back with more Orange Launch Radio, including some actual Vimani news, believe it or not.

711
00:54:56,238 --> 00:54:59,461
[SPEAKER_20]: There's quite a little bit going on this week, so we're gonna talk about that when we come back after this.

712
00:56:35,212 --> 00:56:36,153
Thank you for watching!

713
00:58:12,612 --> 00:58:13,152
[SPEAKER_14]: and many more.

714
00:58:40,430 --> 00:58:41,430
Thank you for watching!

715
00:59:07,168 --> 00:59:08,349
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, yeah, yeah

716
00:59:29,284 --> 00:59:30,786
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

717
01:01:31,058 --> 01:01:39,603
[SPEAKER_31]: Hiho, Kermit the Frog here, informing you that today's broadcast of Orange Lounge Radio is brought to you by the letter B, the letter A, and the number 59.

718
01:01:39,643 --> 01:01:45,466
[SPEAKER_14]: Can you tell me how to get, how to get to Sesame Street?

719
01:01:45,826 --> 01:01:49,409
[SPEAKER_20]: We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 131.

720
01:01:50,969 --> 01:01:57,033
[SPEAKER_20]: A happy early Valentine's Day to all of you people out there, or Singles Awareness Day, whatever the case may be for you.

721
01:01:58,280 --> 01:02:00,542
[SPEAKER_20]: As promised, we're going to talk about some Bavani news right now.

722
01:02:00,622 --> 01:02:03,784
[SPEAKER_20]: Big news, Dancing Stage Unleashed 2.

723
01:02:04,464 --> 01:02:06,726
[SPEAKER_20]: At least if you're in Europe, this will be big news to you.

724
01:02:06,806 --> 01:02:09,208
[SPEAKER_20]: For everybody else, not so big a news.

725
01:02:09,268 --> 01:02:11,269
[SPEAKER_20]: But at least there's a new DDR game on the way.

726
01:02:11,870 --> 01:02:12,310
[SPEAKER_20]: What do you know?

727
01:02:13,911 --> 01:02:15,993
[SPEAKER_20]: A few tracks have already been announced for this game.

728
01:02:16,033 --> 01:02:16,573
[SPEAKER_20]: Pretty cool.

729
01:02:16,953 --> 01:02:18,855
[SPEAKER_20]: Basement Jax, where's your head at?

730
01:02:19,675 --> 01:02:25,980
[SPEAKER_20]: Girls Aloud, Love Machine, Happy Mondays, Step On, Supergrass, Alright.

731
01:02:26,556 --> 01:02:32,277
[SPEAKER_20]: Donna Summer, Hot Stuff, The Jam, A Town Called Malice.

732
01:02:32,958 --> 01:02:36,058
[SPEAKER_20]: All of them supposedly supposed to have the background videos to them as well.

733
01:02:36,959 --> 01:02:37,779
[SPEAKER_20]: Very interesting.

734
01:02:37,919 --> 01:02:38,799
[SPEAKER_20]: Also, you know what else?

735
01:02:39,379 --> 01:02:46,341
[SPEAKER_20]: Basically, by the way, for those who don't know, Dancing Stage Unleashed, it's basically going to be their version of Ultramix 2.

736
01:02:47,441 --> 01:02:48,682
[SPEAKER_20]: So, they're getting that.

737
01:02:49,322 --> 01:02:54,203
[SPEAKER_20]: What's very interesting about this, though, the rumor is that you're going to be able to play this on Xbox Live.

738
01:02:54,733 --> 01:02:59,576
[SPEAKER_20]: You'll be able to play against people in the US if you're in Canada.

739
01:03:00,116 --> 01:03:03,939
[SPEAKER_20]: But only on those songs that the two games share.

740
01:03:05,220 --> 01:03:09,582
[SPEAKER_20]: So that should be interesting though, is that now you can settle the score with any of your buddies that live in Europe.

741
01:03:09,942 --> 01:03:11,924
[SPEAKER_20]: You can actually play on Xbox Live against them.

742
01:03:12,744 --> 01:03:13,985
[SPEAKER_20]: Loki, your thoughts on Unleashed 2?

743
01:03:16,106 --> 01:03:17,027
[SPEAKER_19]: Really just nothing new.

744
01:03:17,797 --> 01:03:22,639
[SPEAKER_19]: as far as gameplay features other than the online thing.

745
01:03:24,640 --> 01:03:36,306
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm interested to see, though, because you know how Ultramix 2, they had their deal with a different drum, what they're going to do as far as the extra music for this game.

746
01:03:36,366 --> 01:03:40,448
[SPEAKER_19]: I wonder if they're going to team up with maybe a UK label or something like that.

747
01:03:40,708 --> 01:03:44,510
[SPEAKER_19]: That would be what I'm waiting for to see what's going to happen there.

748
01:03:48,450 --> 01:03:52,054
[SPEAKER_20]: Any thoughts on Unleashed 2 from Angel or Explicit?

749
01:03:55,057 --> 01:03:55,818
[SPEAKER_30]: Sounds pretty cool.

750
01:03:56,158 --> 01:04:03,345
[SPEAKER_30]: I mean, there's a couple songs that they always get that we don't, that I wish that we had, but, you know, I can keep wishing, whatever.

751
01:04:04,887 --> 01:04:07,950
[SPEAKER_20]: I know, it seems like Europe always gets these awesome licenses, don't they?

752
01:04:08,591 --> 01:04:08,731
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah.

753
01:04:08,751 --> 01:04:10,833
[SPEAKER_20]: Basie and Jax is awesome, and they're getting, oh man.

754
01:04:11,428 --> 01:04:11,668
[SPEAKER_30]: See?

755
01:04:11,848 --> 01:04:12,629
[SPEAKER_30]: Now you're bummed too.

756
01:04:12,809 --> 01:04:13,370
[SPEAKER_20]: I know.

757
01:04:13,470 --> 01:04:14,010
[SPEAKER_20]: A little bit.

758
01:04:14,450 --> 01:04:15,151
[SPEAKER_20]: I want them all.

759
01:04:15,211 --> 01:04:15,771
[SPEAKER_20]: I want all those.

760
01:04:16,092 --> 01:04:18,193
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm tempted to get a Europe PS2 at this point.

761
01:04:18,253 --> 01:04:19,574
[SPEAKER_20]: Although this is going to be for Xbox.

762
01:04:19,955 --> 01:04:22,417
[SPEAKER_20]: I still want a Europe PS2 just to get all the games.

763
01:04:22,937 --> 01:04:25,979
[SPEAKER_20]: But of course then I'd have to get the converter so the TV would show it.

764
01:04:26,420 --> 01:04:27,681
[SPEAKER_20]: It's just not worth it that much.

765
01:04:27,801 --> 01:04:28,181
[SPEAKER_20]: I don't know.

766
01:04:29,182 --> 01:04:29,602
[SPEAKER_20]: Exquisite?

767
01:04:30,123 --> 01:04:30,483
[SPEAKER_20]: Your thoughts?

768
01:04:30,703 --> 01:04:35,407
[SPEAKER_26]: Well, I'm thinking it's the same songs and different steps.

769
01:04:35,687 --> 01:04:36,748
[SPEAKER_26]: New songs and new steps.

770
01:04:36,788 --> 01:04:38,449
[SPEAKER_26]: That's basically what I'm hearing so far.

771
01:04:38,469 --> 01:04:40,671
[SPEAKER_26]: We got the Xbox Lite like I stated earlier.

772
01:04:41,926 --> 01:04:42,846
[SPEAKER_26]: Good thought.

773
01:04:42,866 --> 01:04:45,288
[SPEAKER_26]: I would be interested to know if they're going to get the song packs as well.

774
01:04:45,308 --> 01:04:45,608
[SPEAKER_26]: Who knows?

775
01:04:45,628 --> 01:04:49,429
[SPEAKER_26]: Because that would be a whole lot of songs that you could play, you know, against.

776
01:04:49,449 --> 01:04:50,670
[SPEAKER_26]: Because how many songs is it going to share with...

777
01:05:11,195 --> 01:05:11,656
[SPEAKER_20]: Ultramix 2.

778
01:05:12,036 --> 01:05:12,436
[SPEAKER_20]: I don't know.

779
01:05:12,516 --> 01:05:12,916
[SPEAKER_20]: Probably.

780
01:05:13,357 --> 01:05:17,419
[SPEAKER_20]: I mean, I guess you can probably bet that most of the Konami originals are going to carry over.

781
01:05:17,459 --> 01:05:19,480
[SPEAKER_20]: Things like, I don't know, Zero One, Root 80s.

782
01:05:19,520 --> 01:05:21,202
[SPEAKER_13]: The staple songs that everybody wants.

783
01:05:21,362 --> 01:05:22,142
[SPEAKER_20]: But, I don't know.

784
01:05:22,162 --> 01:05:22,903
[SPEAKER_20]: Will they all?

785
01:05:22,983 --> 01:05:23,463
[SPEAKER_20]: Who knows?

786
01:05:23,663 --> 01:05:24,203
[SPEAKER_20]: We don't know yet.

787
01:05:24,363 --> 01:05:26,265
[SPEAKER_20]: So, we shall see.

788
01:05:27,425 --> 01:05:28,746
[SPEAKER_26]: But then we always have Step Mania.

789
01:05:29,967 --> 01:05:33,189
[SPEAKER_26]: But then we always have Step Mania in case we don't get the songs.

790
01:05:34,049 --> 01:05:38,372
[SPEAKER_26]: Like Ultramix 3 or Extreme 2 or even with DDR with Mario.

791
01:05:39,329 --> 01:05:43,312
[SPEAKER_20]: You know, I'm just looking forward to getting to kick some British ass on Xbox Live, actually.

792
01:05:43,412 --> 01:05:44,713
[SPEAKER_20]: No, I'm kidding.

793
01:05:45,493 --> 01:05:46,634
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm going to get hate mail from that one.

794
01:05:47,114 --> 01:05:51,858
[SPEAKER_20]: Actually, I can't wait to start hearing some of those sexy, sexy accents through the speaker.

795
01:05:53,299 --> 01:05:53,819
[SPEAKER_26]: Name some.

796
01:05:54,299 --> 01:05:57,422
[SPEAKER_20]: You know the, hello, I hope you're having a good day.

797
01:05:58,663 --> 01:06:00,524
[SPEAKER_20]: Would you like to do some DD on, then have some tea?

798
01:06:00,544 --> 01:06:03,586
[SPEAKER_25]: Of course.

799
01:06:05,451 --> 01:06:08,534
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm getting so much hate mail from anybody that's listening to this in Europe right now.

800
01:06:08,574 --> 01:06:09,575
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm just joking.

801
01:06:10,235 --> 01:06:11,276
[SPEAKER_20]: Okay, I'm in California.

802
01:06:11,356 --> 01:06:14,198
[SPEAKER_20]: Haha, we all have blonde hair and blue eyes and go surfing, huh?

803
01:06:14,879 --> 01:06:15,539
[SPEAKER_26]: What?

804
01:06:18,541 --> 01:06:22,525
[SPEAKER_20]: Oh, that could be interesting because you might be playing people in other countries.

805
01:06:22,685 --> 01:06:23,285
[SPEAKER_20]: Is that possible?

806
01:06:24,086 --> 01:06:26,768
[SPEAKER_20]: Do they sell the stuff outside of...

807
01:06:27,538 --> 01:06:29,579
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you for watching, and I'll see you next time.

808
01:06:51,829 --> 01:06:54,150
[SPEAKER_20]: We can speak the universal language of kickin' ass!

809
01:06:54,751 --> 01:06:58,713
[SPEAKER_26]: Oh, get it up.

810
01:06:59,153 --> 01:07:02,095
[SPEAKER_30]: Did I tell you about the last time I beat an Asian on DDR?

811
01:07:04,036 --> 01:07:04,496
[SPEAKER_20]: Wait, what?

812
01:07:04,756 --> 01:07:06,137
[SPEAKER_30]: Even though that was a long-ass time ago?

813
01:07:06,157 --> 01:07:06,918
[SPEAKER_25]: What was this, Angel?

814
01:07:06,958 --> 01:07:07,178
[SPEAKER_30]: What?

815
01:07:08,859 --> 01:07:12,521
[SPEAKER_30]: Oh, I actually beat an Asian playing DDR6 Mix.

816
01:07:13,604 --> 01:07:14,224
[SPEAKER_20]: How old was she?

817
01:07:14,304 --> 01:07:14,584
[SPEAKER_20]: Six?

818
01:07:15,744 --> 01:07:17,365
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm just kidding.

819
01:07:19,345 --> 01:07:20,806
[SPEAKER_30]: He was like 19 or something.

820
01:07:22,806 --> 01:07:28,167
[SPEAKER_30]: He didn't believe that there was actually American people playing DDR and all that stuff.

821
01:07:29,287 --> 01:07:30,548
[SPEAKER_30]: It was kind of funny.

822
01:07:32,628 --> 01:07:33,148
[SPEAKER_30]: That's cool.

823
01:07:34,288 --> 01:07:35,849
[SPEAKER_30]: It was in the middle of Japan.

824
01:07:35,929 --> 01:07:36,509
[SPEAKER_30]: We know this.

825
01:07:37,523 --> 01:07:38,684
[SPEAKER_30]: This was like two years ago.

826
01:07:38,724 --> 01:07:45,087
[SPEAKER_20]: And it's so funny because, you know, some folks make the assumption that instantly, oh, we're all going to get killed by the Japanese on DDR if this happens.

827
01:07:45,527 --> 01:07:46,227
[SPEAKER_20]: But you know what?

828
01:07:46,567 --> 01:07:50,549
[SPEAKER_20]: Just like they're shitty American players, they're shitty Japanese players, you know?

829
01:07:50,869 --> 01:07:54,571
[SPEAKER_20]: Everybody's new to DDR at some point, so, you know, you've got to start somewhere.

830
01:07:54,711 --> 01:07:59,654
[SPEAKER_30]: Until you watch some Japanese girl walk up to the TDX machine and just completely own everyone else.

831
01:08:00,274 --> 01:08:00,834
[SPEAKER_30]: That was insane.

832
01:08:01,275 --> 01:08:01,575
[SPEAKER_30]: Okay.

833
01:08:03,536 --> 01:08:05,897
[SPEAKER_26]: Anyways, you've got people saying, yo, kero DDR.

834
01:08:07,313 --> 01:08:08,073
[SPEAKER_20]: Oh my god.

835
01:08:09,734 --> 01:08:10,394
[SPEAKER_20]: Just stop.

836
01:08:10,594 --> 01:08:11,775
[SPEAKER_20]: Seriously, stop.

837
01:08:16,717 --> 01:08:17,637
[SPEAKER_20]: More news going on.

838
01:08:17,737 --> 01:08:21,599
[SPEAKER_20]: Actually, I don't know if you guys noticed, but DDR Freak had a whole lot of news this week.

839
01:08:21,639 --> 01:08:23,579
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm sure a lot of you guys are watching DDR Freak.

840
01:08:23,920 --> 01:08:28,581
[SPEAKER_20]: And we, of course, have to show a little love to DDR Freak because they replay us on their Friday nights on DDR Freak Radio.

841
01:08:29,722 --> 01:08:30,162
[SPEAKER_20]: Kisses.

842
01:08:31,255 --> 01:08:32,397
[SPEAKER_20]: So they have a lot of stuff.

843
01:08:32,778 --> 01:08:37,086
[SPEAKER_20]: And really what I've noticed this week is a whole lot of looking for people.

844
01:08:37,427 --> 01:08:38,408
[SPEAKER_20]: They're looking for people.

845
01:08:38,428 --> 01:08:39,290
[SPEAKER_20]: There's all sorts of stuff.

846
01:08:39,470 --> 01:08:41,154
[SPEAKER_20]: It's like casting calls left and right.

847
01:08:41,194 --> 01:08:42,115
[SPEAKER_20]: They're looking for people.

848
01:08:42,175 --> 01:08:42,757
[SPEAKER_20]: It's interesting.

849
01:08:44,201 --> 01:08:51,148
[SPEAKER_20]: Speaking of Yokiro DDR, a Spanish language network was looking for a Spanish-speaking DDR player.

850
01:08:51,448 --> 01:08:52,529
[SPEAKER_20]: We don't know what's going on.

851
01:08:52,609 --> 01:08:54,071
[SPEAKER_20]: I don't know what ended up happening with that.

852
01:08:54,271 --> 01:08:56,733
[SPEAKER_20]: I didn't end up reading the comments, but they were looking for somebody.

853
01:08:58,395 --> 01:09:06,883
[SPEAKER_20]: First for Women magazine was looking for a mother who lost weight playing DDR with their kid, which I think, you know what, I think that's kind of neat.

854
01:09:07,183 --> 01:09:07,724
[SPEAKER_20]: That's kind of cool.

855
01:09:08,376 --> 01:09:12,382
[SPEAKER_20]: I know my mom wouldn't even know how to turn on a PlayStation, let alone get up and play DDR.

856
01:09:12,402 --> 01:09:14,084
[SPEAKER_26]: Cool mommies, not mine.

857
01:09:19,119 --> 01:09:21,500
[SPEAKER_20]: And this is a call that everybody could participate on.

858
01:09:21,540 --> 01:09:23,380
[SPEAKER_20]: This is what I thought was really cool.

859
01:09:23,600 --> 01:09:26,541
[SPEAKER_20]: DDR Freak was helping out the Make-A-Wish Foundation of Indiana.

860
01:09:26,601 --> 01:09:28,681
[SPEAKER_20]: They were helping this child's dream come true.

861
01:09:29,662 --> 01:09:35,843
[SPEAKER_20]: This child, Robbie, has a kidney disease, and his wish was for a game room in his home featuring DDR.

862
01:09:36,203 --> 01:09:42,265
[SPEAKER_20]: So they just rallied the troops together to buy him just the supremo setup for DDR.

863
01:09:42,285 --> 01:09:42,945
[SPEAKER_20]: So that's kind of cool.

864
01:09:43,205 --> 01:09:44,465
[SPEAKER_20]: If you're interested in that, check it out.

865
01:09:44,545 --> 01:09:46,846
[SPEAKER_20]: It's the February 10th headline over on DDRFreak.com.

866
01:09:47,774 --> 01:09:48,955
[SPEAKER_20]: is certainly worth participating in.

867
01:09:49,496 --> 01:09:58,543
[SPEAKER_20]: And Red Octane, this was just announced recently, Red Octane's going to be doing a focus group in Sunnyvale this Friday and next Friday.

868
01:09:59,064 --> 01:10:06,070
[SPEAKER_20]: And I guess if you participate, which, by the way, is at 7 o'clock, you have to have your own transportation to Sunnyvale, so if you're on the East Coast, sorry, you're screwed.

869
01:10:06,090 --> 01:10:09,433
[SPEAKER_20]: But if you're somewhere in the Bay Area, Red Octane will provide dinner.

870
01:10:10,594 --> 01:10:11,454
[SPEAKER_20]: I wonder what kind of dinner.

871
01:10:11,474 --> 01:10:13,276
[SPEAKER_26]: All right.

872
01:10:14,819 --> 01:10:17,581
[SPEAKER_20]: Maybe I should write and inquire, are we going to get Black Angus?

873
01:10:17,661 --> 01:10:19,222
[SPEAKER_20]: Or are you going to get, like, you know, McD's?

874
01:10:19,242 --> 01:10:22,725
[SPEAKER_26]: It's Friday, February 18th and Friday, February 25th at 7 o'clock.

875
01:10:22,745 --> 01:10:23,205
[SPEAKER_26]: You know what?

876
01:10:23,245 --> 01:10:26,188
[SPEAKER_26]: What's funny is I'm actually tempted to sign up for it.

877
01:10:26,208 --> 01:10:26,708
[SPEAKER_26]: I'm so damn curious.

878
01:10:26,748 --> 01:10:26,868
[SPEAKER_26]: I just...

879
01:10:43,422 --> 01:10:43,943
[SPEAKER_20]: RedOctane GotSkill

880
01:11:01,756 --> 01:11:03,277
[SPEAKER_26]: I wish I could go, but I can't.

881
01:11:03,917 --> 01:11:11,441
[SPEAKER_26]: Plus, people say it's a bad idea to even go anyways because, you know, some people will still get heated up with drama from the last tournament.

882
01:11:11,561 --> 01:11:12,341
[SPEAKER_26]: It's just stupid.

883
01:11:13,002 --> 01:11:13,762
[SPEAKER_26]: People should grow.

884
01:11:13,802 --> 01:11:17,924
[SPEAKER_26]: I mean, I don't want that, which is the reason why I won't be going as well.

885
01:11:18,965 --> 01:11:21,066
[SPEAKER_26]: So I'll let people take care of their business there.

886
01:11:22,492 --> 01:11:25,033
[SPEAKER_20]: You're a bitter, bitter man after some of these tournaments, aren't you?

887
01:11:25,473 --> 01:11:30,596
[SPEAKER_26]: No, because I'm always bitter to those who can't accept defeat or think they're 100% correct.

888
01:11:31,236 --> 01:11:33,917
[SPEAKER_26]: When they're obviously not, they can't admit their own mistakes.

889
01:11:35,698 --> 01:11:37,899
[SPEAKER_26]: Instead of trying to get better, they just whine.

890
01:11:38,359 --> 01:11:40,560
[SPEAKER_26]: So, I'm just going to leave it as is.

891
01:11:41,260 --> 01:11:43,021
[SPEAKER_26]: Some of the competitors I know are going to go there.

892
01:11:43,801 --> 01:11:44,802
[SPEAKER_26]: Some of the Sacktown people...

893
01:11:46,304 --> 01:11:49,828
[SPEAKER_26]: Team Piss or There's actually a Team Piss now?

894
01:11:49,968 --> 01:12:02,545
[SPEAKER_26]: No, just Team PI Some people call it the Paradise Island Sacktown Squad but it's just called Team PI Not Team Piss Interesting No more piss jokes now I'm trying

895
01:12:03,482 --> 01:12:21,593
[SPEAKER_20]: Alright, if you guys are interested in the Red Octane Focus group, you can check that out on www.ddrfreak.com I'm sure there will be non-disclosure agreements involved, so even if we do get to check it out, if I do decide I want to put in and I get picked, I probably won't be able to talk about it, but, you know, it'll be still kind of neat to see.

896
01:12:21,913 --> 01:12:22,513
[SPEAKER_20]: So, we'll see.

897
01:12:23,394 --> 01:12:23,874
[SPEAKER_20]: We will see.

898
01:12:24,935 --> 01:12:25,355
[SPEAKER_20]: Moving on.

899
01:12:26,836 --> 01:12:27,636
[SPEAKER_20]: This is big news.

900
01:12:27,696 --> 01:12:28,257
[SPEAKER_20]: This is huge.

901
01:12:28,857 --> 01:12:29,558
[SPEAKER_20]: This is huge news.

902
01:12:29,678 --> 01:12:30,118
[SPEAKER_20]: How huge?

903
01:12:30,838 --> 01:12:31,158
[SPEAKER_20]: Huge.

904
01:12:31,339 --> 01:12:31,899
[SPEAKER_20]: Bigger than big.

905
01:12:34,946 --> 01:12:36,687
[SPEAKER_20]: I was supposed to release Exceed 2, not just Exceed.

906
01:12:52,820 --> 01:12:53,661
[SPEAKER_20]: Well, here it is.

907
01:12:53,921 --> 01:12:57,526
[SPEAKER_20]: This is the press release straight from InsertCredit.com.

908
01:12:58,167 --> 01:13:05,918
[SPEAKER_20]: Mastiff has announced that it will be publishing Animero's Pump It Up Exceed for PlayStation 2 and Xbox in North America in June.

909
01:13:06,976 --> 01:13:15,481
[SPEAKER_20]: They made the announcement at the Metreon, and we had an Ace Pump It Up player named Smidget there, and they were strutting their stuff on an arcade in a home version of the Dance Mat game.

910
01:13:15,902 --> 01:13:24,447
[SPEAKER_20]: The Pump It Up franchise, according to this press release, has sold over a quarter million copies of the arcade versions and PC versions thus far.

911
01:13:25,336 --> 01:13:26,917
[SPEAKER_20]: Now you'll notice they don't say what country.

912
01:13:27,817 --> 01:13:31,079
[SPEAKER_26]: I know, but I already know what countries have been selling Pump It Up pretty well.

913
01:13:31,599 --> 01:13:36,042
[SPEAKER_20]: I imagine the PC version isn't doing too badly, but probably not so much in this country.

914
01:13:36,422 --> 01:13:40,024
[SPEAKER_20]: Although, you know, Red Octane has it in their store, and I imagine a lot of people pick it up through there.

915
01:13:40,044 --> 01:13:41,144
[SPEAKER_26]: Here's the thing, though.

916
01:13:41,565 --> 01:13:49,829
[SPEAKER_26]: Let's see, Pump It Up is more international than DDR, because I know Pump It Up is mainly supported in Mexico and mainly South America as well.

917
01:13:49,869 --> 01:13:50,049
[SPEAKER_20]: Right.

918
01:13:50,549 --> 01:13:53,571
[SPEAKER_26]: Because America, mainly DDR, overpopulated the whole...

919
01:13:54,457 --> 01:13:56,898
[SPEAKER_26]: You got your Pump fans, though.

920
01:13:56,938 --> 01:13:59,519
[SPEAKER_26]: I mean, overall, compared to other countries.

921
01:13:59,579 --> 01:14:01,860
[SPEAKER_26]: I know Mexico populizes Pump It Up.

922
01:14:03,140 --> 01:14:05,301
[SPEAKER_26]: Argentina, Chile, or anywhere in South America.

923
01:14:05,401 --> 01:14:06,502
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah, I've heard the same thing.

924
01:14:06,542 --> 01:14:12,724
[SPEAKER_20]: A lot of South American countries are really big on Pump It Up, as well as a lot of the countries in the East that aren't Japan or China.

925
01:14:12,804 --> 01:14:15,225
[SPEAKER_20]: A lot of those other countries... Korea.

926
01:14:15,245 --> 01:14:17,106
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah, definitely.

927
01:14:17,246 --> 01:14:20,067
[SPEAKER_26]: I'm not sure what other places support Pump It Up as well.

928
01:14:21,064 --> 01:14:35,034
[SPEAKER_20]: It should be noted, this is not going to be the exact same as the Korean PS2 version that was just launched, because there's going to be some exclusive songs, including a song by Stereogram called Walkie Talkie Man, and it's going to have the actual video that runs in the background.

929
01:14:35,074 --> 01:14:37,856
[SPEAKER_20]: For those of you guys who haven't seen it, it's like a claymation video.

930
01:14:37,876 --> 01:14:38,977
[SPEAKER_20]: It's kind of a rock song.

931
01:14:39,318 --> 01:14:40,879
[SPEAKER_20]: It's not your typical dance song.

932
01:14:40,939 --> 01:14:42,740
[SPEAKER_20]: It's kind of more of a rockish song.

933
01:14:43,060 --> 01:14:48,204
[SPEAKER_20]: But then again, a lot of the Korean songs in Pump It Up were kind of rock songs, so...

934
01:14:49,113 --> 01:14:49,793
[SPEAKER_20]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

935
01:15:19,654 --> 01:15:20,494
[SPEAKER_20]: I don't know how they do it.

936
01:15:20,554 --> 01:15:33,758
[SPEAKER_20]: If you could do autoplay on the middle, which wouldn't really be the game then, there's really no way to get these third-party pads to work unless the third-party pad has all the buttons, I don't know, is a nine-square pad or something.

937
01:15:34,298 --> 01:15:36,319
[SPEAKER_20]: The lack of a center button is really going to screw things up.

938
01:15:36,479 --> 01:15:37,839
[SPEAKER_20]: Loki?

939
01:15:37,899 --> 01:15:41,280
[SPEAKER_20]: There are the, oh, what pads are those?

940
01:15:41,360 --> 01:15:47,022
[SPEAKER_19]: There are the, I want to say Cobalt Flux pads do have the center button.

941
01:15:48,712 --> 01:15:51,294
[SPEAKER_19]: Those will be able to be used, but those are high-end ones.

942
01:15:52,375 --> 01:15:57,319
[SPEAKER_20]: As nice of a pad as Cobalt Flux is, how popular is it really?

943
01:15:57,660 --> 01:16:00,602
[SPEAKER_20]: It's not the kind of thing you walk into GameStop and purchase, right?

944
01:16:01,083 --> 01:16:03,946
[SPEAKER_20]: I had a hard enough time finding an Ignition 2.0 locally.

945
01:16:04,266 --> 01:16:10,752
[SPEAKER_20]: And even when I bought an Ignition 2.0, I spent $100 on DancePad, they were like, we've never sold one of these before.

946
01:16:10,812 --> 01:16:12,193
[SPEAKER_20]: You're actually going to buy this?

947
01:16:12,774 --> 01:16:14,075
[SPEAKER_20]: What the fuck is wrong with you?

948
01:16:15,458 --> 01:16:17,343
[SPEAKER_20]: And I was just kind of like, it's a good pad.

949
01:16:17,603 --> 01:16:20,751
[SPEAKER_20]: I don't want to spend $20 on the cheap pad that's going to break next week.

950
01:16:21,243 --> 01:16:22,284
[SPEAKER_20]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

951
01:16:46,306 --> 01:16:50,589
[SPEAKER_26]: Granted, it might be a little bit... It's really not the same dance style though.

952
01:16:50,849 --> 01:16:51,249
[SPEAKER_26]: It's really not.

953
01:17:14,003 --> 01:17:15,884
[SPEAKER_20]: I think Pump It Up is easier to freestyle to.

954
01:17:16,004 --> 01:17:22,988
[SPEAKER_26]: I think a lot of the songs you automatically, like your body's in a motion where you're... Yeah, because you're given a lot of room on freestyle itself in Pump It Up.

955
01:17:23,088 --> 01:17:25,550
[SPEAKER_20]: And like I said, it's a real different type of music too.

956
01:17:26,791 --> 01:17:29,052
[SPEAKER_19]: That's my problem with it, and this is the big one.

957
01:17:29,913 --> 01:17:33,455
[SPEAKER_19]: How the fuck are you going to be able to play those extreme and crazy songs?

958
01:17:34,075 --> 01:17:34,796
[SPEAKER_26]: That is true!

959
01:17:36,054 --> 01:17:38,356
[SPEAKER_26]: There's one song that's impossible to even beat.

960
01:17:38,436 --> 01:17:42,858
[SPEAKER_19]: There's where they have the four or five button mashing.

961
01:17:42,878 --> 01:17:46,220
[SPEAKER_19]: I mean, it's just not fun.

962
01:17:46,280 --> 01:17:54,666
[SPEAKER_19]: That's my main complaint about Pump It Up at the beginning is those crazy songs where you have to do knee drops and shit.

963
01:17:54,866 --> 01:17:55,326
[SPEAKER_19]: No thanks.

964
01:17:56,940 --> 01:17:59,122
[SPEAKER_20]: In The Groove is not DDR Unless it's convenient for it to be DDR

965
01:18:25,057 --> 01:18:29,618
[SPEAKER_20]: because whenever people bitch about a lack of DDR, then they go, oh, well, there's always In The Groove.

966
01:18:30,138 --> 01:18:32,439
[SPEAKER_20]: I thought you just said In The Groove wasn't DDR.

967
01:18:34,039 --> 01:18:35,120
[SPEAKER_20]: That's my number one complaint.

968
01:18:35,640 --> 01:18:36,000
[SPEAKER_26]: Same here.

969
01:18:36,020 --> 01:18:37,180
[SPEAKER_26]: I mean, some people are confused.

970
01:18:37,200 --> 01:18:38,640
[SPEAKER_26]: They're basically two different games.

971
01:18:38,660 --> 01:18:41,661
[SPEAKER_26]: They have different timing, different music, different options.

972
01:18:42,541 --> 01:18:44,522
[SPEAKER_26]: I mean, it's all different.

973
01:18:44,862 --> 01:18:46,302
[SPEAKER_26]: Some people say they're trying to compare.

974
01:18:46,322 --> 01:18:49,003
[SPEAKER_26]: It's like, ooh, In The Groove is DDR 9th mix.

975
01:18:50,563 --> 01:18:50,823
[SPEAKER_20]: No.

976
01:18:52,044 --> 01:18:53,224
[SPEAKER_20]: No, I wouldn't go that far.

977
01:18:54,679 --> 01:18:54,779
[SPEAKER_20]: Pump

978
01:19:16,718 --> 01:19:17,739
[SPEAKER_26]: Pump it up, yeah.

979
01:19:39,441 --> 01:19:48,024
[SPEAKER_20]: You and I, you being the Bomani addict, because you're actually taking time to tune in and listen to this show, you and I understand the differences between DDR and Pump It Up.

980
01:19:48,885 --> 01:19:56,368
[SPEAKER_20]: But the casual gamer, a parent who walks into a GameStop buying the stuff for their kid, are they going to really understand the difference?

981
01:19:56,768 --> 01:19:56,928
[SPEAKER_20]: No.

982
01:19:56,968 --> 01:20:01,510
[SPEAKER_20]: And the people who are supplying this, I think a lot of people are going to view it as a cheap knockoff of DDR.

983
01:20:02,290 --> 01:20:03,070
[SPEAKER_26]: Yeah, obviously.

984
01:20:03,190 --> 01:20:05,371
[SPEAKER_20]: I think that's the way the casual gamer is going to look at it.

985
01:20:05,751 --> 01:20:07,872
[SPEAKER_20]: Now, but here's the thing, if the price is right...

986
01:20:08,433 --> 01:20:09,254
[SPEAKER_20]: That could help it.

987
01:20:10,094 --> 01:20:12,597
[SPEAKER_20]: You know, somebody wants to get into the dance thing.

988
01:20:13,457 --> 01:20:19,542
[SPEAKER_26]: According to how they view, that's just like, just because Pump It has a stepping arrow does not mean it's a rip-off of DDR.

989
01:20:19,582 --> 01:20:28,289
[SPEAKER_26]: Look at other games like, that's just like saying, ooh, there's a lot of Mario knock-offs, or there's a lot of Doom knock-offs, and et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.

990
01:20:28,310 --> 01:20:29,991
[SPEAKER_26]: I can keep going on and on about that.

991
01:20:30,542 --> 01:20:35,086
[SPEAKER_20]: Here's the thing, again, again, you're talking about the casual gamer versus the addict, the dance game addict.

992
01:20:35,106 --> 01:20:38,528
[SPEAKER_20]: The casual gamer, you can see that a game is not Mario.

993
01:20:38,608 --> 01:20:40,430
[SPEAKER_20]: You can see that this game is not Mario.

994
01:20:41,050 --> 01:20:45,153
[SPEAKER_20]: But you see that this is another dance game with arrows that scroll up to the top of the screen that you hit them.

995
01:20:45,994 --> 01:20:47,175
[SPEAKER_20]: You and I understand the difference.

996
01:20:47,836 --> 01:20:48,416
[SPEAKER_20]: Most people don't.

997
01:20:49,682 --> 01:20:50,583
[SPEAKER_26]: Sadly, that's true.

998
01:20:52,064 --> 01:20:52,685
[SPEAKER_26]: Unfortunately.

999
01:20:52,705 --> 01:21:01,051
[SPEAKER_26]: Because so many people are so narrow-minded to judge from their first impressions without getting a chance to look deeply what the game is all about.

1000
01:21:02,052 --> 01:21:10,259
[SPEAKER_26]: It's like, ooh, they say, ooh, Resident Evil, or anything they see is popular, they're going to buy it, regardless if the game is either good or bad.

1001
01:21:10,499 --> 01:21:12,581
[SPEAKER_26]: You just look from their eyes.

1002
01:21:15,742 --> 01:21:25,005
[SPEAKER_26]: I think the price has a lot to do with it.

1003
01:21:25,785 --> 01:21:30,247
[SPEAKER_20]: I'd be very curious to know how that little Mad Catz game is selling right now.

1004
01:21:30,287 --> 01:21:33,208
[SPEAKER_20]: That shitty little Mad Catz GameCube game, the dance game.

1005
01:21:33,268 --> 01:21:36,029
[SPEAKER_20]: I'd be very curious to know how that's doing right now.

1006
01:21:36,049 --> 01:21:39,670
[SPEAKER_20]: I don't think it's doing too hot, but I'd be very curious to know.

1007
01:21:40,878 --> 01:21:43,339
[SPEAKER_26]: From my source, I think it's not doing good at all.

1008
01:21:44,100 --> 01:21:45,620
[SPEAKER_26]: Considering that some people actually played it.

1009
01:21:45,660 --> 01:21:48,821
[SPEAKER_26]: It just feels unnatural.

1010
01:21:48,841 --> 01:21:52,703
[SPEAKER_20]: But again, the people that you're talking to are DDR and Bomani addicts.

1011
01:21:52,743 --> 01:21:53,383
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm not talking about DDR.

1012
01:21:53,403 --> 01:21:55,324
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm talking about casual gamers.

1013
01:21:55,784 --> 01:21:57,365
[SPEAKER_26]: Not just DDR addicts and stuff.

1014
01:21:58,325 --> 01:21:59,966
[SPEAKER_26]: Not the people we know in the community.

1015
01:22:00,166 --> 01:22:02,007
[SPEAKER_26]: Just regular casual gamers.

1016
01:22:02,527 --> 01:22:06,449
[SPEAKER_20]: I'd just be curious to know.

1017
01:22:06,829 --> 01:22:07,569
[SPEAKER_20]: But that's the thing.

1018
01:22:08,469 --> 01:22:09,590
[SPEAKER_20]: This is my other concern.

1019
01:22:10,623 --> 01:22:14,726
[SPEAKER_20]: What if that game, heaven forbid, is somebody's first exposure to a dance game?

1020
01:22:15,506 --> 01:22:17,067
[SPEAKER_20]: Then they'd never want to play DDR.

1021
01:22:17,668 --> 01:22:20,730
[SPEAKER_20]: They'd be all, oh, I played one of those dancing games once, it was stupid.

1022
01:22:23,792 --> 01:22:29,115
[SPEAKER_26]: Yeah, like I said, something that comes first will always get the fish, and people are just going to buy that.

1023
01:22:29,495 --> 01:22:34,559
[SPEAKER_20]: I think that's where, and when a lot of folks say, I'm kind of going on a little tangent here, but I don't care.

1024
01:22:34,599 --> 01:22:39,302
[SPEAKER_20]: When a lot of folks say, and back to the in the groove, not being DDR, again...

1025
01:22:39,946 --> 01:22:40,446
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah, unfortunately.

1026
01:22:40,466 --> 01:22:41,246
[SPEAKER_20]: So, something to think about.

1027
01:23:10,883 --> 01:23:11,964
[SPEAKER_26]: That's how I view sports games.

1028
01:23:12,004 --> 01:23:12,724
[SPEAKER_26]: Madden, Blitz...

1029
01:23:38,339 --> 01:23:39,540
[SPEAKER_20]: They're all football games to me.

1030
01:23:40,901 --> 01:23:42,962
[SPEAKER_20]: They're interchangeable parts to me.

1031
01:23:43,182 --> 01:23:44,342
[SPEAKER_20]: A football game is a football game.

1032
01:23:44,722 --> 01:23:50,785
[SPEAKER_20]: But if I were the sports guy, I would be saying, Oh, Sky, you're an ignorant motherfucker.

1033
01:23:50,845 --> 01:23:53,006
[SPEAKER_20]: These games are all different.

1034
01:23:53,306 --> 01:23:57,529
[SPEAKER_20]: This game's got this license, and this game you can play in the street.

1035
01:23:58,689 --> 01:24:01,550
[SPEAKER_20]: But to me, the football games, they're all the same.

1036
01:24:01,590 --> 01:24:02,591
[SPEAKER_20]: I played one, I played them all.

1037
01:24:05,091 --> 01:24:06,152
[SPEAKER_26]: Okay, that's true.

1038
01:24:06,212 --> 01:24:13,539
[SPEAKER_26]: Maybe I'm just being a little too critical with what I think about certain games, especially when I've played practically almost every game there is.

1039
01:24:14,700 --> 01:24:18,123
[SPEAKER_26]: Mainly because I go to a friend of mine who keeps running games and I play them.

1040
01:24:20,209 --> 01:24:22,150
[SPEAKER_20]: Alright, we're going to take a break, you guys.

1041
01:24:22,370 --> 01:24:25,052
[SPEAKER_20]: We're going to take a break, and then when we come back, we're going to open up the Skype line.

1042
01:24:25,452 --> 01:24:28,133
[SPEAKER_20]: We want to hear from some of you guys, some comments after this break.

1043
01:24:28,213 --> 01:24:32,335
[SPEAKER_20]: I want to talk about Loki's little work of art he's completed this week.

1044
01:24:32,355 --> 01:24:34,256
[SPEAKER_20]: Some of you guys have heard about this.

1045
01:24:34,276 --> 01:24:35,057
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah, it's right there.

1046
01:24:35,097 --> 01:24:35,477
[SPEAKER_20]: Look at that.

1047
01:24:35,877 --> 01:24:36,477
[SPEAKER_20]: Isn't that crazy?

1048
01:24:37,538 --> 01:24:39,839
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah, we'll talk about that when we come back from the break.

1049
01:24:39,859 --> 01:24:40,539
[SPEAKER_20]: We're going to talk about all that.

1050
01:24:40,559 --> 01:24:42,621
[SPEAKER_20]: We're going to open up the Skype line, and we're going to have ourselves a cage match.

1051
01:24:42,661 --> 01:24:43,421
[SPEAKER_20]: Believe it or not...

1052
01:24:44,291 --> 01:24:45,692
[SPEAKER_20]: We're kind of running long right now.

1053
01:24:45,712 --> 01:24:47,832
[SPEAKER_20]: We're actually behind schedule.

1054
01:24:47,872 --> 01:24:50,013
[SPEAKER_20]: We should have been in the cage match already, so this is going to be interesting.

1055
01:24:50,353 --> 01:24:51,193
[SPEAKER_20]: I know, it's weird.

1056
01:24:51,993 --> 01:24:55,294
[SPEAKER_20]: I totally thought... I was like, shit, it's going to be a short show tonight.

1057
01:24:55,314 --> 01:24:56,395
[SPEAKER_20]: We've got nothing to talk about.

1058
01:24:56,895 --> 01:24:59,076
[SPEAKER_20]: Luckily, there's been a lot of news that's helped us keep going.

1059
01:24:59,716 --> 01:25:01,156
[SPEAKER_20]: We'll talk about all this stuff when we come back.

1060
01:25:01,236 --> 01:25:05,157
[SPEAKER_20]: In this break, another type of love song for your Valentine's Day.

1061
01:25:05,798 --> 01:25:06,278
[SPEAKER_20]: We'll be back.

1062
01:25:08,908 --> 01:25:22,015
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, do it all night, do it with me I'll take you to heaven if you make me feel free, babe Do it tonight, do it all right Just take me and shake me till I burn up inside

1063
01:25:52,728 --> 01:25:53,492
Thank you for watching!

1064
01:26:33,166 --> 01:26:34,424
[SPEAKER_04]: Come on, do it with me.

1065
01:27:12,431 --> 01:27:13,014
Thanks for watching!

1066
01:28:47,354 --> 01:28:58,924
[SPEAKER_14]: I open my eyes and everything's still the same I turn to the guy who was dead last night I'm asking, what's your name?

1067
01:29:34,716 --> 01:29:36,000
Thanks for watching!

1068
01:30:20,925 --> 01:30:21,906
and many more.

1069
01:31:13,860 --> 01:31:14,880
Thanks for watching!

1070
01:31:40,223 --> 01:31:41,464
[SPEAKER_20]: Orange Lounge Radio.

1071
01:31:41,804 --> 01:31:43,966
[SPEAKER_20]: We put your thing down, flip it, and reverse it.

1072
01:31:49,689 --> 01:31:51,591
[SPEAKER_17]: You know, they played that song at the club last night, too.

1073
01:31:52,471 --> 01:31:54,252
[SPEAKER_20]: Gotta beat, better work it.

1074
01:31:54,473 --> 01:31:55,093
[SPEAKER_20]: I love that song.

1075
01:31:55,333 --> 01:31:55,633
[SPEAKER_20]: Love it.

1076
01:31:56,454 --> 01:32:02,338
[SPEAKER_20]: Anyway, in that break you heard some songs there, a different type of Valentine's Day for you.

1077
01:32:02,778 --> 01:32:08,642
[SPEAKER_20]: Do It All Night, Injection of Love, So Many Men, and Jack and Mark Get Busy.

1078
01:32:09,178 --> 01:32:09,478
[SPEAKER_20]: Get it?

1079
01:32:09,798 --> 01:32:10,299
[SPEAKER_20]: Jack and Mark?

1080
01:32:10,319 --> 01:32:10,939
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah, alright.

1081
01:32:12,000 --> 01:32:16,883
[SPEAKER_20]: Even though the song really has nothing... Anyway, I just think it's got a funny title.

1082
01:32:17,383 --> 01:32:25,848
[SPEAKER_20]: I couldn't think of a fourth song that was kind of... Without doing like a four song erotic break, trying to mix up the artists a little bit, I couldn't think of a fourth song.

1083
01:32:26,589 --> 01:32:31,072
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm sure now they'll be yelling ideas in the chat room, so we'll see.

1084
01:32:31,092 --> 01:32:31,532
[SPEAKER_20]: Anyway.

1085
01:32:31,552 --> 01:32:31,772
[SPEAKER_20]: Anyway.

1086
01:32:32,771 --> 01:32:34,592
[SPEAKER_20]: We are going to open up the Skype line in a little bit.

1087
01:32:34,612 --> 01:32:41,335
[SPEAKER_20]: If you're trying to call in right now, we're not going to take your call just yet because we want to give folks a chance to fire up the Skype line and call in.

1088
01:32:42,175 --> 01:32:43,636
[SPEAKER_20]: www.orangeonradio.com.

1089
01:32:43,656 --> 01:32:45,877
[SPEAKER_20]: Click on Interact With Us if you want more information.

1090
01:32:45,917 --> 01:32:49,138
[SPEAKER_20]: Before we do that, though, I want to talk about Loki's little project.

1091
01:32:49,983 --> 01:32:58,909
[SPEAKER_20]: Loki's been working on this project for several weeks now, and this is exciting to me, because he has actually finished this project.

1092
01:32:59,009 --> 01:33:02,111
[SPEAKER_20]: And I've known Loki a while now, and he never finishes his projects.

1093
01:33:02,632 --> 01:33:05,193
[SPEAKER_20]: This is like the first project I've seen him actually finish.

1094
01:33:05,233 --> 01:33:06,814
[SPEAKER_20]: So, Loki, set it up for us.

1095
01:33:07,555 --> 01:33:10,757
[SPEAKER_20]: What is this you're doing, and why did you... Angel, if you'd be so kind.

1096
01:33:12,538 --> 01:33:14,940
[SPEAKER_20]: What is this you're doing, and why?

1097
01:33:14,960 --> 01:33:15,040
[SPEAKER_20]: Okay.

1098
01:33:16,443 --> 01:33:20,484
[SPEAKER_19]: I basically made a portable computer that's inside of an Xbox.

1099
01:33:21,605 --> 01:33:21,965
[SPEAKER_19]: Why?

1100
01:33:22,545 --> 01:33:23,025
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't know.

1101
01:33:23,165 --> 01:33:26,926
[SPEAKER_19]: I could have simply bought a laptop for the amount of money they spent building this damn thing.

1102
01:33:27,046 --> 01:33:30,688
[SPEAKER_20]: By the way, screen caps on orangeonsradio.com right now if you want to save them.

1103
01:33:30,728 --> 01:33:31,588
[SPEAKER_20]: That would be lovely.

1104
01:33:31,748 --> 01:33:32,948
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm sure we'd appreciate that.

1105
01:33:33,869 --> 01:33:35,369
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah, because I need, you know.

1106
01:33:35,869 --> 01:33:38,370
[SPEAKER_19]: Anyways, there it is.

1107
01:33:38,790 --> 01:33:39,710
[SPEAKER_19]: It's on the webcam.

1108
01:33:41,191 --> 01:33:41,811
[SPEAKER_19]: The orange box.

1109
01:33:42,554 --> 01:33:43,254
[SPEAKER_19]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1110
01:34:13,957 --> 01:34:15,938
[SPEAKER_19]: It's got Windows XP on it right now.

1111
01:34:16,878 --> 01:34:21,719
[SPEAKER_19]: I have built a portable monitor to go with it, which is on the webcam right now.

1112
01:34:22,179 --> 01:34:30,841
[SPEAKER_19]: It's actually inside of a metal CD case, and it runs off of batteries if it needs to be, which in this case it is running off of battery power right now.

1113
01:34:31,701 --> 01:34:35,022
[SPEAKER_19]: Normally the PC itself actually does have a battery, however...

1114
01:34:36,028 --> 01:34:40,311
[SPEAKER_19]: As of charging it up today, it looks like the battery is defective or something.

1115
01:34:40,331 --> 01:34:43,713
[SPEAKER_19]: It only charged about 75% of the way before it said it was full.

1116
01:34:44,473 --> 01:34:47,355
[SPEAKER_19]: And it's not, so I have to send that back.

1117
01:34:47,395 --> 01:34:48,536
[SPEAKER_19]: So that kind of sucks.

1118
01:34:50,077 --> 01:34:52,738
[SPEAKER_19]: Everything looks really sweet.

1119
01:34:52,818 --> 01:34:54,960
[SPEAKER_19]: I wish I could open the case up for you guys to see.

1120
01:34:55,040 --> 01:35:00,023
[SPEAKER_19]: It's got a UV fan on the top of it, kind of like a blower.

1121
01:35:01,383 --> 01:35:06,285
[SPEAKER_19]: And so basically the whole thing is just, you know, self-contained in this Xbox case right now.

1122
01:35:06,986 --> 01:35:07,466
[SPEAKER_19]: Pretty sweet.

1123
01:35:07,486 --> 01:35:20,632
[SPEAKER_19]: It's kind of slow because Micro-ITX PCs are only, they have the processor built into the actual motherboard, and it's only 1 gigahertz, so we're talking a little slow, but...

1124
01:35:21,584 --> 01:35:23,725
[SPEAKER_20]: You know, hey, for a portable PC, it's not bad.

1125
01:35:24,586 --> 01:35:28,248
[SPEAKER_20]: I think it's interesting that the monitor is just one of those PS1 screens.

1126
01:35:29,549 --> 01:35:31,150
[SPEAKER_20]: It's crazy.

1127
01:35:31,971 --> 01:35:33,552
[SPEAKER_20]: How can you see things on that?

1128
01:35:34,332 --> 01:35:35,293
[SPEAKER_20]: Very carefully.

1129
01:35:35,653 --> 01:35:37,374
[SPEAKER_20]: Literally, it's a five-inch monitor.

1130
01:35:38,041 --> 01:35:43,724
[SPEAKER_20]: And as if those 15-inch screens weren't bad enough, you are doing computing work on a 5-inch monitor.

1131
01:35:43,965 --> 01:35:51,869
[SPEAKER_19]: Well, I have a shortcut on the desktop for the magnifier in case I can't read something.

1132
01:35:52,489 --> 01:35:57,512
[SPEAKER_19]: Because it does get tough, especially when I set up the graphics and stuff.

1133
01:35:57,612 --> 01:36:04,596
[SPEAKER_19]: I have the resolution set really low so I can actually be able to do stuff with it.

1134
01:36:06,462 --> 01:36:10,785
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah, it's a lovely shot of our floor there on the webcam right now in the massive DVD collection there.

1135
01:36:14,208 --> 01:36:17,750
[SPEAKER_19]: And so, yeah, the lowest I could go... I'm sorry, what do you want?

1136
01:36:18,010 --> 01:36:19,411
[SPEAKER_25]: What's the resolution by 320x240?

1137
01:36:19,852 --> 01:36:22,293
[SPEAKER_25]: I don't think you can go that low, can you?

1138
01:36:23,334 --> 01:36:25,696
[SPEAKER_26]: Is it the PS screen?

1139
01:36:25,716 --> 01:36:33,661
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm not sure if it can go by... No, it's really actually, to be honest, because I have it 640x480 and I adjusted all the fonts so they're huge.

1140
01:36:34,422 --> 01:36:34,482
[SPEAKER_19]: Um...

1141
01:36:35,040 --> 01:36:36,721
[SPEAKER_19]: I can actually read it pretty well.

1142
01:36:36,941 --> 01:36:43,606
[SPEAKER_19]: I mean, the icon, you know, the icons, you can read what they say on it and everything.

1143
01:36:44,947 --> 01:36:46,468
[SPEAKER_19]: It's not that hard to read.

1144
01:36:46,628 --> 01:36:54,814
[SPEAKER_19]: And like I said, I have the magnifier, you know, macro, or not really macro, but a shortcut to the magnifier.

1145
01:36:54,974 --> 01:36:59,077
[SPEAKER_19]: And if I can't read anything, you just move it over there and you can actually read it.

1146
01:36:59,117 --> 01:37:03,600
[SPEAKER_19]: There's a little window at the top that magnifies everything really big so you can actually see it.

1147
01:37:04,096 --> 01:37:11,042
[SPEAKER_19]: But this monitor, I mean, not only will it output, it'll output to anything that takes the TV out, you know, or TV in.

1148
01:37:11,182 --> 01:37:16,306
[SPEAKER_19]: So I can hook this up to the TV and that's, you know, you won't have any problem seeing the picture.

1149
01:37:16,807 --> 01:37:22,371
[SPEAKER_19]: This is just for, you know, to make it sure portable, which I hope to take it with me to E3.

1150
01:37:24,333 --> 01:37:26,615
[SPEAKER_19]: That was the whole purpose of building it in the first place.

1151
01:37:27,475 --> 01:37:28,156
[SPEAKER_19]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1152
01:37:43,535 --> 01:37:47,176
[SPEAKER_19]: And the Xbox being the largest console system that I can think of.

1153
01:37:48,416 --> 01:37:49,536
[SPEAKER_20]: Well, you know what's funny?

1154
01:37:50,297 --> 01:37:53,397
[SPEAKER_20]: Have you shown an above shot of it where they can see the fan?

1155
01:37:53,737 --> 01:37:59,999
[SPEAKER_20]: Because it's so funny because you actually drilled out that little Xbox logo that's in the center of an Xbox, and that's where you put the fan.

1156
01:38:00,439 --> 01:38:02,059
[SPEAKER_20]: And I find that so hilarious.

1157
01:38:02,099 --> 01:38:02,579
[SPEAKER_20]: I don't know why.

1158
01:38:02,639 --> 01:38:03,979
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm so easily amused by that.

1159
01:38:04,339 --> 01:38:06,720
[SPEAKER_20]: But the way you laid everything out is so funny.

1160
01:38:07,280 --> 01:38:08,000
[SPEAKER_20]: Plus, I think it's funny.

1161
01:38:08,040 --> 01:38:10,501
[SPEAKER_20]: You were telling me about how you were holding some of the stuff in.

1162
01:38:10,861 --> 01:38:11,161
[SPEAKER_20]: You were...

1163
01:38:12,430 --> 01:38:20,957
[SPEAKER_20]: Literally parts of this computer are being held together by duct tape and zip ties.

1164
01:38:20,977 --> 01:38:21,817
[SPEAKER_19]: No, not duct tape.

1165
01:38:22,558 --> 01:38:23,799
[SPEAKER_19]: Zip ties for the most part.

1166
01:38:24,239 --> 01:38:32,446
[SPEAKER_19]: The hard drive is being held in by zip ties because the way it had to be mounted, I couldn't mount it on the bottom because I didn't have the right screws for it.

1167
01:38:32,926 --> 01:38:36,188
[SPEAKER_19]: So I actually mounted it with zip ties and that sucker ain't moving.

1168
01:38:36,208 --> 01:38:36,709
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay.

1169
01:38:37,403 --> 01:38:38,643
[SPEAKER_19]: CD-ROM CD Burner

1170
01:38:57,710 --> 01:38:58,491
[SPEAKER_20]: You actually have a drive?

1171
01:38:58,551 --> 01:39:00,373
[SPEAKER_20]: I didn't realize you had a drive in there.

1172
01:39:00,453 --> 01:39:01,674
[SPEAKER_20]: Where the hell did you fit that?

1173
01:39:01,854 --> 01:39:03,115
[SPEAKER_19]: There's a CD burner in there.

1174
01:39:03,135 --> 01:39:09,059
[SPEAKER_19]: It actually fits in there right where the normal drive would be.

1175
01:39:09,079 --> 01:39:09,880
[SPEAKER_19]: That is crazy.

1176
01:39:09,900 --> 01:39:14,664
[SPEAKER_19]: The only problem is lately it's been sticking, so I've got to figure out why that is.

1177
01:39:15,124 --> 01:39:18,286
[SPEAKER_19]: But that barely fit in there with the fan in there.

1178
01:39:18,807 --> 01:39:20,788
[SPEAKER_20]: It's literally pressed up right against the fan.

1179
01:39:21,849 --> 01:39:25,332
[SPEAKER_20]: Dark Knight says if Bill Gates were to see that, Loki would be so toast right now.

1180
01:39:26,488 --> 01:39:28,169
[SPEAKER_19]: It's running Microsoft Windows.

1181
01:39:31,431 --> 01:39:32,911
[SPEAKER_19]: It's not like I put Linux in it.

1182
01:39:33,071 --> 01:39:34,392
[SPEAKER_20]: Can you install Linux on it?

1183
01:39:34,412 --> 01:39:36,713
[SPEAKER_20]: Because God knows they'll install Linux on anything they can.

1184
01:39:38,894 --> 01:39:40,555
[SPEAKER_20]: I think it's quite a little complicated.

1185
01:39:40,715 --> 01:39:44,377
[SPEAKER_20]: But you didn't go out and buy an Xbox and gut it.

1186
01:39:44,477 --> 01:39:46,258
[SPEAKER_19]: No, I bought a case online.

1187
01:39:46,358 --> 01:39:46,798
[SPEAKER_20]: On eBay.

1188
01:39:47,519 --> 01:39:48,019
[SPEAKER_19]: Not on eBay.

1189
01:39:48,059 --> 01:39:53,762
[SPEAKER_19]: There's an actual website that they sell case mods and stuff so you can buy clear cases.

1190
01:39:53,782 --> 01:39:54,862
[SPEAKER_19]: I should have bought a clear case.

1191
01:39:54,882 --> 01:39:55,583
[SPEAKER_19]: That would have been cool.

1192
01:39:55,603 --> 01:39:56,243
[SPEAKER_19]: But they were like,

1193
01:39:56,678 --> 01:40:04,421
[SPEAKER_19]: I bought a case and everything is mounted on my own.

1194
01:40:04,461 --> 01:40:09,884
[SPEAKER_19]: I had to make and drill mounts for the motherboard.

1195
01:40:10,004 --> 01:40:11,985
[SPEAKER_19]: I had to dremel the hell out of this.

1196
01:40:12,605 --> 01:40:19,428
[SPEAKER_19]: I want to move it so I can show the other side here, but I'm afraid I'm going to knock the power thing out again.

1197
01:40:21,243 --> 01:40:49,092
[SPEAKER_19]: but anyways, yeah, um, unlike most PCs where you have all your ports on the back of the PC this has all the ports on the side of the Xbox, so it would be on the left hand side, um, and I unfortunately cannot reach the camera over there to see that, but trust me, they're there um, and then the power's in the back, the power right now was being held on by hot glue, however that fell off, so it's being held on by uh, um wire right now, that's

1198
01:40:49,622 --> 01:40:52,343
[SPEAKER_19]: Just temporary until I get some super glue to put that on there.

1199
01:40:52,463 --> 01:40:58,026
[SPEAKER_20]: No, I thought the original idea for this is that it was going to be something you were going to have in a backpack or something and carry around with you.

1200
01:40:58,166 --> 01:41:01,128
[SPEAKER_19]: I guess that idea is kind of out the window at this point.

1201
01:41:01,248 --> 01:41:01,928
[SPEAKER_19]: What the hell?

1202
01:41:02,689 --> 01:41:07,651
[SPEAKER_19]: To buy stuff to make your own wearable PC is way too expensive.

1203
01:41:07,731 --> 01:41:13,094
[SPEAKER_20]: I was just thinking, my God, with a fan on the top like that, that's kind of dangerous in a way, if you're not careful.

1204
01:41:13,254 --> 01:41:17,156
[SPEAKER_19]: Well, I'm going to have a grill over it, so that's not going to be a problem.

1205
01:41:17,536 --> 01:41:19,437
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, right now, though, it doesn't have a grill over it.

1206
01:41:19,741 --> 01:41:31,985
[SPEAKER_19]: That's the cool thing about this, though, is with the fan being right over... Where the fan is located is right on top of the RAM and the North and South Bridge on the motherboard.

1207
01:41:32,025 --> 01:41:35,866
[SPEAKER_19]: You know, the two main chips that they have on there to do all the processing.

1208
01:41:36,286 --> 01:41:40,147
[SPEAKER_19]: And then slightly diagonal of that is the processor.

1209
01:41:40,848 --> 01:41:45,229
[SPEAKER_19]: So all of the heat that's generated off that is just shot out of the top like nothing.

1210
01:41:45,809 --> 01:41:48,130
[SPEAKER_19]: So this PC will not overheat at all.

1211
01:41:49,301 --> 01:41:49,981
[SPEAKER_19]: XBOX BOOT UP SCREEN

1212
01:42:14,540 --> 01:42:15,360
[SPEAKER_19]: That is the background.

1213
01:42:16,281 --> 01:42:18,682
[SPEAKER_19]: I can't get a very good shot of the picture right now.

1214
01:42:20,143 --> 01:42:23,965
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, it says... Maybe I'll see if we can get in here.

1215
01:42:24,785 --> 01:42:27,787
[SPEAKER_19]: Well, anyways, it says the Orange Box PC created by Loki.

1216
01:42:27,887 --> 01:42:30,548
[SPEAKER_19]: I'll post the pictures of that screen later.

1217
01:42:31,269 --> 01:42:36,551
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, it is the actual screen there, and I have the theme kind of going with it.

1218
01:42:36,972 --> 01:42:39,473
[SPEAKER_19]: This case that's in right now, actually...

1219
01:42:40,277 --> 01:42:41,998
[SPEAKER_19]: I'll probably just unplug this real quick.

1220
01:42:42,018 --> 01:42:43,539
[SPEAKER_20]: Are there a lot of people out there that have done this?

1221
01:42:43,699 --> 01:42:45,740
[SPEAKER_20]: Turned their Xboxes and gutted them and done PCs?

1222
01:42:46,060 --> 01:42:48,081
[SPEAKER_19]: There's a few people that have.

1223
01:42:49,162 --> 01:42:55,045
[SPEAKER_19]: I've seen one that they've actually shoved a GameCube inside of an Xbox as well as an Xbox.

1224
01:42:55,546 --> 01:42:56,326
[SPEAKER_21]: Interesting.

1225
01:42:56,366 --> 01:43:02,830
[SPEAKER_19]: Then I've seen people that have actually taken the whole Xbox stuff out, put it in a PC case with a PlayStation 2 and...

1226
01:43:05,339 --> 01:43:11,682
[SPEAKER_19]: and also pretty much all the game systems all in one, which is kind of retarded, but whatever.

1227
01:43:12,643 --> 01:43:20,927
[SPEAKER_19]: But yeah, and I've got to paint the case still for the modern orange as well to match the rest, but that's optional, of course.

1228
01:43:22,028 --> 01:43:22,548
[SPEAKER_20]: Interesting.

1229
01:43:22,668 --> 01:43:23,749
[SPEAKER_20]: All right, well, thanks for sharing.

1230
01:43:23,809 --> 01:43:29,472
[SPEAKER_20]: Maybe we can get some clearer pics and put them up on our website because we don't really use our... I can use the cam page for anything.

1231
01:43:30,152 --> 01:43:30,813
[SPEAKER_19]: We'll figure something out.

1232
01:43:30,833 --> 01:43:31,553
[SPEAKER_20]: All right, we'll figure something out.

1233
01:43:31,949 --> 01:43:35,852
[SPEAKER_20]: Anyway, we are going to open up the Skype line for some feedback if you guys want to call in.

1234
01:43:35,872 --> 01:43:39,074
[SPEAKER_20]: If you want to talk about the Xbox PC, if you have any questions for Loki on that.

1235
01:43:39,535 --> 01:43:45,279
[SPEAKER_20]: Or, of course, we're willing to talk to you guys for a little bit about the Pump It Up news, about the DDR news, all that stuff.

1236
01:43:46,079 --> 01:43:49,001
[SPEAKER_20]: Call in right now, www.orangeloungeradio.com.

1237
01:43:49,341 --> 01:43:53,985
[SPEAKER_20]: Click on the Interact With Us link for more information about how to get a hold of us through the Skype line.

1238
01:43:54,465 --> 01:43:59,809
[SPEAKER_20]: Meanwhile, while we wait for that, because it takes a minute for the buffer to hit, let's say hello to Bugged, who just joined us in the studio.

1239
01:44:00,543 --> 01:44:02,164
[SPEAKER_02]: Hello to Bugged, who just joined us in the studio.

1240
01:44:02,224 --> 01:44:02,864
[SPEAKER_20]: How you doing, sir?

1241
01:44:02,884 --> 01:44:04,365
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, naked hot tubbing, actually.

1242
01:44:05,386 --> 01:44:05,606
[SPEAKER_02]: What?

1243
01:44:06,046 --> 01:44:06,766
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that was yesterday.

1244
01:44:07,407 --> 01:44:09,007
[SPEAKER_02]: Every night in San Jose, I did some naked hot tubbing.

1245
01:44:12,509 --> 01:44:13,730
[SPEAKER_02]: Close your mouth or you're tracking flies.

1246
01:44:13,750 --> 01:44:14,010
[SPEAKER_02]: Wait.

1247
01:44:15,010 --> 01:44:15,971
[SPEAKER_20]: Run that by me again.

1248
01:44:16,051 --> 01:44:16,471
[SPEAKER_20]: Why?

1249
01:44:16,871 --> 01:44:17,432
[SPEAKER_20]: Why the hell not?

1250
01:44:19,793 --> 01:44:20,333
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay, whatever.

1251
01:44:20,613 --> 01:44:21,274
[SPEAKER_02]: There was a hot tub?

1252
01:44:22,654 --> 01:44:22,995
[SPEAKER_20]: I don't know.

1253
01:44:23,115 --> 01:44:24,015
[SPEAKER_20]: I don't know how to follow that up.

1254
01:44:24,035 --> 01:44:24,615
[SPEAKER_20]: All right, let's go.

1255
01:44:24,956 --> 01:44:26,516
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank God we have somebody on the Skype line.

1256
01:44:26,556 --> 01:44:27,557
[SPEAKER_20]: Hi, you're on Orange Sounds Radio.

1257
01:44:29,704 --> 01:44:34,867
[SPEAKER_20]: Legend of Zaku here Hello, Legend of Zaku, you're a little bit choppy tonight, what's up?

1258
01:44:38,529 --> 01:44:52,517
[SPEAKER_12]: Let me see, yeah, the choppiness of my school's connection, IRC basically kicking me out You know, basically dying on me a few times, that's why they used a new program for IRC now Well, life sucks, what's on your mind?

1259
01:44:54,731 --> 01:44:55,291
[SPEAKER_12]: Let me see.

1260
01:44:56,292 --> 01:45:02,955
[SPEAKER_12]: All this jive about people just, you know, being so pessimistic about, you know, can I make another mix, another arcade mix?

1261
01:45:03,015 --> 01:45:06,136
[SPEAKER_12]: That's just really, I don't know, that's kind of getting to me personally.

1262
01:45:07,817 --> 01:45:12,259
[SPEAKER_20]: You're just upset that people are pretty much writing it off and people are saying it's never going to happen?

1263
01:45:12,839 --> 01:45:14,000
[SPEAKER_12]: They're doubters.

1264
01:45:14,060 --> 01:45:17,181
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, they're basically pessimistic as we speak.

1265
01:45:17,201 --> 01:45:20,582
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm not saying any names, but that's the mood I'm sensing right now.

1266
01:45:20,943 --> 01:45:21,323
[SPEAKER_12]: Well...

1267
01:45:22,645 --> 01:45:28,027
[SPEAKER_20]: You can't say that there's for sure never going to be another Konami arcade mix because there is one coming out in Europe.

1268
01:45:28,087 --> 01:45:28,728
[SPEAKER_20]: We know that much.

1269
01:45:28,928 --> 01:45:29,708
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

1270
01:45:30,308 --> 01:45:37,051
[SPEAKER_12]: If it does good, then Konami can rethink their plans of bringing it stateside.

1271
01:45:37,312 --> 01:45:40,773
[SPEAKER_20]: Is it possible there will be a new arcade mix?

1272
01:45:40,933 --> 01:45:41,614
[SPEAKER_20]: I say yes.

1273
01:45:42,134 --> 01:45:42,394
[SPEAKER_20]: But...

1274
01:45:43,167 --> 01:45:46,133
[SPEAKER_20]: I don't think we really know at this point what's going to happen.

1275
01:45:46,153 --> 01:45:51,222
[SPEAKER_20]: If it's going to happen tomorrow, if it's going to happen in the next couple of years, or what.

1276
01:45:51,242 --> 01:45:52,985
[SPEAKER_02]: Is this a life-turning event for you?

1277
01:45:53,967 --> 01:45:54,188
[SPEAKER_02]: Well...

1278
01:45:55,109 --> 01:46:08,215
[SPEAKER_20]: No, but at the same time, it's kind of sad that DDR introduced me to all these people and gave me an idea for a radio show that we've been doing for the past few years and everything.

1279
01:46:08,695 --> 01:46:13,697
[SPEAKER_20]: It's just kind of sad that DDR helped with all that and now the game is not happening.

1280
01:46:14,117 --> 01:46:16,118
[SPEAKER_20]: And that's why people are so passionate about it.

1281
01:46:16,158 --> 01:46:19,400
[SPEAKER_12]: Because people have been sucking down on Xtreme for about two years now.

1282
01:46:20,363 --> 01:46:31,087
[SPEAKER_20]: I agree that the longer it goes on, the more that the other games, like In the Groove and Pump It Up, are going to catch on.

1283
01:46:31,187 --> 01:46:33,787
[SPEAKER_12]: So I agree that Konami is shooting themselves in the foot, but what can you do?

1284
01:46:33,807 --> 01:46:36,028
[SPEAKER_12]: What the hell?

1285
01:46:36,488 --> 01:46:36,888
[SPEAKER_21]: What the hell?

1286
01:46:41,880 --> 01:46:44,583
[SPEAKER_20]: I don't know what that noise was either, but that's right.

1287
01:46:45,644 --> 01:46:59,158
[SPEAKER_20]: Well, you know, as far as the petitions and things go, that's all nice and dandy, but I think it really sits in Konami of Japan's court, and we're all basically their bitches right now until they make a decision.

1288
01:47:01,536 --> 01:47:04,158
[SPEAKER_12]: Don't we have advocates such as Jason Enos?

1289
01:47:04,859 --> 01:47:05,900
[SPEAKER_12]: Don't we got these people?

1290
01:47:05,980 --> 01:47:07,141
[SPEAKER_20]: They're fabulous more.

1291
01:47:21,454 --> 01:47:21,994
[SPEAKER_20]: Fabulous!

1292
01:47:22,554 --> 01:47:35,717
[SPEAKER_20]: DDR Extreme, despite all the crap... Well, despite all the crap DDR Extreme got from some people, they tried something different, they tried a lot of new things, and for the most part, it was pretty cool.

1293
01:47:35,857 --> 01:47:38,037
[SPEAKER_20]: And for the casual player, it was very cool.

1294
01:47:38,457 --> 01:47:42,638
[SPEAKER_20]: So, as far as DDR Home stuff in America, they're really not doing anything wrong.

1295
01:47:42,838 --> 01:47:43,738
[SPEAKER_20]: They're doing everything right.

1296
01:47:44,338 --> 01:47:45,658
[SPEAKER_20]: So, you can't fault them.

1297
01:47:46,579 --> 01:47:47,519
[SPEAKER_20]: So, I don't know.

1298
01:47:47,959 --> 01:47:48,259
[SPEAKER_12]: I know.

1299
01:47:50,383 --> 01:47:53,786
[SPEAKER_12]: I know, I can't, I know, I can accept that, but, you know, come on now.

1300
01:47:53,946 --> 01:47:59,010
[SPEAKER_12]: Two years without a mix, that's just, you know, there has to be something done.

1301
01:47:59,791 --> 01:48:00,151
[SPEAKER_12]: Anything.

1302
01:48:00,231 --> 01:48:05,095
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't care if you just make at least a faint, you know, action of just starting to make one.

1303
01:48:05,575 --> 01:48:10,197
[SPEAKER_12]: I would care as long as I know that you guys are thinking, as long as I know that Konami's thinking of something.

1304
01:48:10,397 --> 01:48:13,498
[SPEAKER_20]: Well, hopefully they'll give us a clue at some point.

1305
01:48:13,538 --> 01:48:19,139
[SPEAKER_20]: But anyway, Zach, we're going to let you go because there's a bunch of people trying to get in and you're kind of fading out anyway, so I've got to let you go, buddy.

1306
01:48:19,179 --> 01:48:19,760
[SPEAKER_20]: But have a good one.

1307
01:48:19,800 --> 01:48:20,400
[SPEAKER_20]: Thanks for calling.

1308
01:48:20,780 --> 01:48:21,060
[SPEAKER_20]: Later.

1309
01:48:22,481 --> 01:48:24,001
[SPEAKER_20]: All right, let's pick up this one.

1310
01:48:24,901 --> 01:48:25,942
[SPEAKER_20]: Hi, you're on Orange Lawns Radio.

1311
01:48:27,002 --> 01:48:28,462
[SPEAKER_32]: Hey, Sky, it's Al Mullet again.

1312
01:48:28,603 --> 01:48:29,403
[SPEAKER_32]: Hello, Al Mullet.

1313
01:48:29,423 --> 01:48:29,903
[SPEAKER_32]: What's on your mind?

1314
01:48:31,209 --> 01:48:35,512
[SPEAKER_32]: Well, basically, Legend of Zaku was talking about how he wasn't going to name names.

1315
01:48:35,552 --> 01:48:37,193
[SPEAKER_32]: Well, that was the other half of that argument.

1316
01:48:37,293 --> 01:48:38,334
[SPEAKER_20]: Okay, all right.

1317
01:48:38,374 --> 01:48:40,195
[SPEAKER_20]: So you want to give us the other half of the story here, then?

1318
01:48:40,796 --> 01:48:53,884
[SPEAKER_32]: Well, basically, all my other half was is that I'm sure Konami would love to release another arcade mix here in the States, but then again, they're going to have to look at how profitable is it going to be for them at this point in time.

1319
01:48:56,686 --> 01:48:56,706
[SPEAKER_20]: I...

1320
01:48:58,343 --> 01:49:01,725
[SPEAKER_20]: I would think it's profitable, personally, but I don't know.

1321
01:49:01,825 --> 01:49:06,607
[SPEAKER_20]: I mean, I don't have... I have a skewed perspective, and I think we all do as DDR addicts.

1322
01:49:06,667 --> 01:49:10,349
[SPEAKER_20]: We think our game is perfect and it's making Konami tons of money, and we don't really know.

1323
01:49:11,010 --> 01:49:23,336
[SPEAKER_20]: But when I see the imitators doing well, such as Pump It Up is doing so well that now they're going to do a home release, it kind of makes me go, hmm, if the imitators are doing well...

1324
01:49:25,569 --> 01:49:36,276
[SPEAKER_20]: That's true, but now that the imitators are moving to the home markets, I'm hoping that this news about Puppet Up being released on a console in the US is a huge wake-up call.

1325
01:49:36,596 --> 01:49:45,662
[SPEAKER_20]: But then again, the US console scene is not where Konami needs a wake-up call, because as I said in the last call, they're doing everything right, as far as I'm concerned.

1326
01:49:46,483 --> 01:49:47,504
[SPEAKER_32]: That's true, that's true.

1327
01:49:47,884 --> 01:49:49,405
[SPEAKER_20]: They're not the ones that need the wake-up call.

1328
01:49:49,465 --> 01:49:51,066
[SPEAKER_20]: They should go out and release this in Japan.

1329
01:49:52,569 --> 01:49:58,393
[SPEAKER_20]: Right, I mean, the one thing that really... Which I guess they've done already, but who knows.

1330
01:49:58,433 --> 01:50:03,196
[SPEAKER_32]: The one thing that really gets me is that people are bitching and moaning, the U.S.

1331
01:50:03,236 --> 01:50:06,898
[SPEAKER_32]: needs a new arcade mix when there hasn't been a new U.S.

1332
01:50:07,038 --> 01:50:08,559
[SPEAKER_32]: arcade mix in years.

1333
01:50:09,700 --> 01:50:16,824
[SPEAKER_20]: Well, that's a very good point, is people often confuse these Japanese releases that get imported as U.S.

1334
01:50:17,184 --> 01:50:18,085
[SPEAKER_20]: releases, but...

1335
01:50:18,935 --> 01:50:24,576
[SPEAKER_32]: Not only that, but we kind of shot our own selves in the foot as far as US arcade games go.

1336
01:50:25,096 --> 01:50:33,938
[SPEAKER_32]: Because when DDRUSA was released, the arcade version, it seemed more people wanted to play the imports.

1337
01:50:33,958 --> 01:50:36,899
[SPEAKER_32]: They wanted to play the ones with the 50, the 80, the 100 song lists.

1338
01:50:36,959 --> 01:50:40,400
[SPEAKER_20]: Well, because DDRUSA, for the most part, was crap.

1339
01:50:40,440 --> 01:50:43,601
[SPEAKER_20]: And so was the first home release, when you put it side by side with the import.

1340
01:50:43,641 --> 01:50:45,161
[SPEAKER_20]: But now, I trust...

1341
01:50:46,038 --> 01:50:49,199
[SPEAKER_20]: Canami of America way more now than I would have back then.

1342
01:50:49,920 --> 01:50:54,142
[SPEAKER_20]: Because I would think that if they put out an arcade, like I said, I said this when Ultra Mix 2 first came out.

1343
01:50:54,622 --> 01:50:56,883
[SPEAKER_20]: Make Canami of Hawaii do the next arcade mix.

1344
01:50:57,303 --> 01:50:58,604
[SPEAKER_20]: We'll all want to have sex with it.

1345
01:50:58,704 --> 01:50:59,364
[SPEAKER_20]: It'll be beautiful.

1346
01:51:01,945 --> 01:51:03,366
[SPEAKER_20]: Hook up with a different drum again.

1347
01:51:04,166 --> 01:51:05,047
[SPEAKER_20]: It'll be a beautiful mix.

1348
01:51:05,914 --> 01:51:06,775
[SPEAKER_20]: Nobody's going to complain.

1349
01:51:07,055 --> 01:51:09,758
[SPEAKER_32]: I agree 100% with you there, Sky.

1350
01:51:09,798 --> 01:51:16,185
[SPEAKER_32]: Anyway, moving off of this subject, the reason why I wanted to call was because of the new P.I.U.

1351
01:51:16,305 --> 01:51:17,306
[SPEAKER_32]: North American release.

1352
01:51:18,026 --> 01:51:20,449
[SPEAKER_20]: Sometimes I just like to take the I out and call it P.U.,

1353
01:51:22,142 --> 01:51:22,623
[SPEAKER_21]: I just got here.

1354
01:51:22,703 --> 01:51:23,083
[SPEAKER_20]: I just got here.

1355
01:51:23,103 --> 01:51:23,944
[SPEAKER_20]: There's been no comedy.

1356
01:51:23,964 --> 01:51:25,025
[SPEAKER_21]: There's a song list for the U.S.

1357
01:51:25,045 --> 01:51:25,465
[SPEAKER_21]: one out?

1358
01:51:49,608 --> 01:51:57,550
[SPEAKER_32]: Yeah, if you check down in the DDR Freak thread, if you check down like very low in the second post, they've already released a song list.

1359
01:51:58,110 --> 01:52:05,052
[SPEAKER_32]: It's going to be very heavily influenced by the Korean version, the Korean home version.

1360
01:52:05,772 --> 01:52:12,994
[SPEAKER_32]: It's going to be 85 songs, tons of banya, there's going to be tons of K-pop.

1361
01:52:13,194 --> 01:52:14,575
[SPEAKER_20]: Surprise, tons of banya.

1362
01:52:15,115 --> 01:52:15,875
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah, obviously.

1363
01:52:16,670 --> 01:52:18,351
[SPEAKER_32]: But there's going to be lots of K-pop.

1364
01:52:19,693 --> 01:52:23,015
[SPEAKER_32]: You've heard that there's going to be some exclusive American content.

1365
01:52:24,617 --> 01:52:28,720
[SPEAKER_32]: The K-pop dwarfs that by like five or six times.

1366
01:52:28,940 --> 01:52:29,741
[SPEAKER_20]: Interesting.

1367
01:52:30,462 --> 01:52:34,085
[SPEAKER_20]: Are you saying the song list is on page two of that thread, is what you said?

1368
01:52:34,405 --> 01:52:34,865
[SPEAKER_20]: Page two.

1369
01:52:34,985 --> 01:52:35,546
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, there it is.

1370
01:52:36,247 --> 01:52:36,547
[SPEAKER_20]: I see it.

1371
01:52:36,607 --> 01:52:37,147
[SPEAKER_20]: Okay, never mind.

1372
01:52:37,187 --> 01:52:37,528
[SPEAKER_20]: I got it.

1373
01:52:37,588 --> 01:52:37,888
[SPEAKER_20]: I see it.

1374
01:52:38,268 --> 01:52:39,409
[SPEAKER_20]: Ooh, we get Starion.

1375
01:52:39,449 --> 01:52:39,990
[SPEAKER_20]: That's hot.

1376
01:52:40,410 --> 01:52:41,171
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah, definitely.

1377
01:52:41,191 --> 01:52:42,252
[SPEAKER_26]: That's an obvious one.

1378
01:52:42,512 --> 01:52:43,773
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah, I know, but that song's so hot.

1379
01:52:43,813 --> 01:52:43,953
[SPEAKER_20]: NXT 2.

1380
01:52:47,759 --> 01:52:49,360
[SPEAKER_20]: Crystal Method, Name of the Game.

1381
01:52:50,000 --> 01:52:55,282
[SPEAKER_20]: Wasn't somebody, somebody was saying that that song needed to be in a dance game for like the longest time.

1382
01:52:55,422 --> 01:52:56,242
[SPEAKER_20]: Was it you, Lanky?

1383
01:52:56,882 --> 01:52:59,983
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm thinking Lanky Style said it, but maybe it was you, Loki.

1384
01:53:00,083 --> 01:53:00,443
[SPEAKER_20]: I don't know.

1385
01:53:01,004 --> 01:53:01,524
[SPEAKER_20]: That's hot.

1386
01:53:02,224 --> 01:53:05,505
[SPEAKER_20]: Elvis, Little Less Conversation, which is funny, that's a DDR song.

1387
01:53:05,885 --> 01:53:10,127
[SPEAKER_20]: Let's Groove, not the DDR version, but the original Earth, Wind, Fire.

1388
01:53:11,307 --> 01:53:13,348
[SPEAKER_20]: And Rapper's Delight, Sugar Hill Gang.

1389
01:53:13,448 --> 01:53:14,308
[SPEAKER_24]: What the hell?

1390
01:53:14,868 --> 01:53:16,189
[SPEAKER_20]: Hey, that's kind of hot.

1391
01:53:17,059 --> 01:53:19,682
[SPEAKER_32]: They're borrowing a lot from Dancing Stage, I can see.

1392
01:53:20,022 --> 01:53:21,064
[SPEAKER_20]: Interesting.

1393
01:53:21,464 --> 01:53:22,365
[SPEAKER_26]: Seems to be interesting.

1394
01:53:22,946 --> 01:53:23,486
[SPEAKER_20]: Alright.

1395
01:53:24,287 --> 01:53:26,470
[SPEAKER_20]: And then, like, just a whole shitload of Banya songs.

1396
01:53:27,448 --> 01:53:45,325
[SPEAKER_32]: I've also noticed that we have about 15 songs less so far than the Korean version and I think that's a pretty good move because it seems like in the Korean song list they put all of their good stuff on one disc and I don't like that.

1397
01:53:45,625 --> 01:53:53,412
[SPEAKER_32]: If I see all of their good stuff in one game it probably means that they're not going to have a hell of a lot of good stuff for the sequel.

1398
01:53:54,958 --> 01:53:58,923
[SPEAKER_20]: My only concern with buying this game at this point is that I don't want to spend the money on the other pad.

1399
01:53:59,204 --> 01:54:00,726
[SPEAKER_20]: So this game better be well-priced.

1400
01:54:02,608 --> 01:54:10,338
[SPEAKER_32]: But they say this is going to be bundled with a pad, so at least there's that.

1401
01:54:11,260 --> 01:54:12,341
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, I'm willing to check it out.

1402
01:54:14,304 --> 01:54:16,485
[SPEAKER_32]: I'm just happy that I get to play Turkey March at home.

1403
01:54:18,245 --> 01:54:19,106
[SPEAKER_32]: I'm not that fickle.

1404
01:54:20,226 --> 01:54:21,967
[SPEAKER_32]: For DDR, it's Moonlight Shadow.

1405
01:54:22,567 --> 01:54:24,527
[SPEAKER_32]: And to a lesser extent, Undude Trois.

1406
01:54:24,647 --> 01:54:26,928
[SPEAKER_32]: For Pump It Up, it's Turkey March.

1407
01:54:27,708 --> 01:54:28,109
[SPEAKER_20]: You know what?

1408
01:54:28,189 --> 01:54:30,169
[SPEAKER_20]: And for me, it's Funky Tonight.

1409
01:54:30,289 --> 01:54:31,050
[SPEAKER_20]: I love that song.

1410
01:54:31,330 --> 01:54:32,930
[SPEAKER_20]: And Starion.

1411
01:54:33,951 --> 01:54:35,891
[SPEAKER_20]: So I'm thrilled as hell about this mix.

1412
01:54:36,231 --> 01:54:36,831
[SPEAKER_20]: So that's cool.

1413
01:54:37,392 --> 01:54:40,893
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you for giving us a heads up to the song list there.

1414
01:54:40,913 --> 01:54:41,413
[SPEAKER_20]: I appreciate that.

1415
01:54:41,897 --> 01:54:43,779
[SPEAKER_20]: www.insidepulse.com visit it, love it, read his column have a good one, bye bye

1416
01:55:03,001 --> 01:55:03,962
[SPEAKER_26]: Yeah, I agree too.

1417
01:55:04,462 --> 01:55:06,944
[SPEAKER_20]: I would read it all for you guys, but there's a lot to it.

1418
01:55:06,984 --> 01:55:10,687
[SPEAKER_20]: But basically, all those big pump songs you guys know about, they're in there.

1419
01:55:10,967 --> 01:55:14,570
[SPEAKER_20]: Actually, I didn't see if Run To You was in there, but somebody in the chatroom will tell me.

1420
01:55:14,630 --> 01:55:23,476
[SPEAKER_26]: I don't think so, because they took out the license for Run To You and XSEED 2, and they're probably taking out the new license from DJ Doc itself.

1421
01:55:24,537 --> 01:55:25,398
[SPEAKER_20]: Maybe, I don't know, we'll see.

1422
01:55:25,438 --> 01:55:26,599
[SPEAKER_20]: Somebody in the chatroom will tell me, I don't know.

1423
01:55:26,619 --> 01:55:27,059
[SPEAKER_26]: We'll see what's up.

1424
01:55:27,899 --> 01:55:30,580
[SPEAKER_20]: Alright, why don't we get to the cage match?

1425
01:55:30,660 --> 01:55:33,982
[SPEAKER_20]: I will open up the Skype line again a little bit later in the show if you guys are interested in calling in.

1426
01:55:34,022 --> 01:55:40,445
[SPEAKER_20]: But for right now, we're going to get into the Orange Lounge Radio cage match because we're running a little bit behind in show right now.

1427

[SPEAKER_20]: So remember guys, if you want to participate in the cage match, you have to be in our chat room.

1430
01:55:56,129 --> 01:56:00,194
[SPEAKER_20]: The way the Orange Lounge Radio Cage Match works, we play three songs for you guys.

1431
01:56:00,214 --> 01:56:09,604
[SPEAKER_20]: You guys vote on your favorite, and the winning song goes into rotation all week long on Orange Lounge Radio's 24-7 Bomani Music & More program.

1432
01:56:10,185 --> 01:56:14,971
[SPEAKER_20]: Last week in the Orange Lounge Cage Match, Freeze Poop, I'm sorry, Freeze Pop won.

1433
01:56:17,625 --> 01:56:19,607
[SPEAKER_20]: You have to hear all their songs so you can get that joke.

1434
01:56:20,028 --> 01:56:28,297
[SPEAKER_20]: Freeze Pop, a favorite band of ours from Amplitude and Frequency and Boston, won with their song called Stakeout.

1435
01:56:32,119 --> 01:56:32,960
[SPEAKER_20]: All right, well, we'll see.

1436
01:56:33,240 --> 01:56:36,503
[SPEAKER_20]: Will Loki be happy and Freeze Pop will be voted out tonight?

1437
01:56:36,943 --> 01:56:39,726
[SPEAKER_20]: Or will I be happy and this song stays in for another week?

1438
01:56:39,786 --> 01:56:40,426
[SPEAKER_20]: We will find out.

1439
01:56:40,466 --> 01:56:41,567
[SPEAKER_20]: It's in your hands, you guys.

1440
01:56:41,988 --> 01:56:44,990
[SPEAKER_20]: Here's a clip, because you only get to hear a clip because it won last week.

1441
01:56:45,331 --> 01:56:47,312
[SPEAKER_20]: Remember, you can't vote until all three songs have played.

1442
01:56:47,352 --> 01:56:51,256
[SPEAKER_20]: Here's a clip of song number one, last week's winner, Freeze Pop, Stakeout.

1443
01:57:14,508 --> 01:57:18,672
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm on a stakeout I'm on a stakeout I'm on a stakeout

1444
01:57:36,913 --> 01:57:49,687
[SPEAKER_03]: I've got a plan in mind for you I'm waiting till the time is right I know that you like what I do No need to put up a fight Watching you from far away You look so sweet and clueless Soon I'll move in on my prey It's time for me to do this

1445
01:58:06,620 --> 01:58:16,250
[SPEAKER_03]: The feeling is elating, biding my time Yeah, I know that you'll soon be mine Soon to mine Can't let you see me, can't let you see me, can't let you see me

1446
01:58:49,688 --> 01:58:52,511
DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1447
01:59:10,464 --> 01:59:18,366
[SPEAKER_19]: I picked this song by a group that sounds just like Echo Image, and they also have, their group name is almost like Echo Image, it's Echoing Green.

1448
01:59:19,286 --> 01:59:19,686
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay.

1449
01:59:21,066 --> 01:59:22,447
[SPEAKER_19]: And this is the time of my life.

1450
01:59:23,087 --> 01:59:24,347
[SPEAKER_20]: Actually, it's the story of our lives.

1451
01:59:24,387 --> 01:59:27,628
[SPEAKER_19]: Whatever, story of our lives, time of my life, close enough.

1452
01:59:27,708 --> 01:59:28,868
[SPEAKER_19]: Story of our lives.

1453
01:59:29,068 --> 01:59:30,488
[SPEAKER_20]: Any reason you wanted to pick this?

1454
01:59:31,008 --> 01:59:33,509
[SPEAKER_19]: It just, I don't know, it reminded me of Echo Image.

1455
01:59:34,429 --> 01:59:38,910
[SPEAKER_20]: Alright, here it is, song number two, Loki's pick, Echoing Green, Story of Our Lives.

1456
01:59:54,696 --> 02:00:00,479
[SPEAKER_14]: and everything is meaningless when the weather's waiting we're captive to this place

1457
02:00:47,303 --> 02:01:12,881
[SPEAKER_14]: A song to stay behind to sing the story of our lives In this place, loneliness is never-ending constant

1458
02:01:21,538 --> 02:01:22,903
[SPEAKER_14]: DarkSakura.com

1459
02:02:40,931 --> 02:02:41,971
Music Music Music Music Music

1460
02:03:12,152 --> 02:03:12,739
Thanks for watching!

1461
02:04:40,013 --> 02:04:40,574
Thanks for watching!

1462
02:05:10,539 --> 02:05:12,779
[SPEAKER_20]: Okay, that was song number two in tonight's cage match.

1463
02:05:12,919 --> 02:05:15,340
[SPEAKER_20]: Echoing Green, Story of Our Lives.

1464
02:05:15,800 --> 02:05:17,920
[SPEAKER_20]: Let's see what we thought of that here in the room.

1465
02:05:18,040 --> 02:05:19,421
[SPEAKER_20]: Start off with Angel tonight.

1466
02:05:20,461 --> 02:05:23,821
[SPEAKER_30]: I thought it did remind me a little bit of Echo Image, so I'll give them that.

1467
02:05:24,081 --> 02:05:26,022
[SPEAKER_30]: Um, it's pretty good.

1468
02:05:26,042 --> 02:05:28,762
[SPEAKER_30]: Um, seven and a half.

1469
02:05:29,502 --> 02:05:30,423
[SPEAKER_21]: Alright, Exquisite.

1470
02:05:32,503 --> 02:05:33,623
[SPEAKER_26]: Uh, Nate, it's pretty good.

1471
02:05:33,963 --> 02:05:36,164
[SPEAKER_26]: I can see a big influence on Echo Image.

1472
02:05:36,544 --> 02:05:36,944
[SPEAKER_21]: Alright.

1473
02:05:37,724 --> 02:05:38,044
[SPEAKER_21]: Uh, Bug.

1474
02:05:40,470 --> 02:05:40,770
[SPEAKER_21]: What?

1475
02:05:42,951 --> 02:05:44,332
[SPEAKER_21]: Give it a score on a scale of 1 to 10.

1476
02:05:45,513 --> 02:05:46,013
[SPEAKER_21]: Alright, fine.

1477
02:05:46,053 --> 02:05:46,373
[SPEAKER_21]: Loki.

1478
02:05:47,314 --> 02:05:47,654
[SPEAKER_21]: Loki.

1479
02:05:48,775 --> 02:05:52,617
[SPEAKER_19]: I liked it, so it gets a 9.

1480
02:05:53,658 --> 02:06:01,923
[SPEAKER_20]: For once, I actually kind of like a song that Loki put in Cage Match a whole lot, but I think it's a little long and it's kind of weird for Cage Match.

1481
02:06:02,083 --> 02:06:06,426
[SPEAKER_20]: I don't know if I could hear that on our station, but I like the song, so I have to give it at least an 8.

1482
02:06:07,246 --> 02:06:07,787
[SPEAKER_20]: It's not like an 8.5.

1483
02:06:08,877 --> 02:06:13,761
[SPEAKER_20]: Alright, let's get into song number three this week, which comes to us via DarkSakura.

1484
02:06:13,861 --> 02:06:18,165
[SPEAKER_20]: Even though she's not here tonight, she still gets to put a song in, so here it is.

1485
02:06:18,605 --> 02:06:21,948
[SPEAKER_20]: She has chosen some Schwarzstein for you guys.

1486
02:06:23,169 --> 02:06:26,372
[SPEAKER_20]: And I believe it's a band she put in Cage Match before, but this is a new song.

1487
02:06:26,412 --> 02:06:29,734
[SPEAKER_20]: It's called Faster Love, and it's song number three in tonight's Cage Match.

1488
02:06:29,774 --> 02:06:30,235
[SPEAKER_20]: Enjoy, you guys.

1489
02:06:33,945 --> 02:06:34,646
Thanks for watching!

1490
02:07:06,988 --> 02:07:08,190
Thanks for watching!

1491
02:07:37,057 --> 02:07:38,158
Thank you for watching!

1492
02:08:37,350 --> 02:08:39,671
Thank you for watching!

1493
02:09:07,831 --> 02:09:09,132
[SPEAKER_14]: DarkSakura

1494
02:09:49,491 --> 02:09:50,872
Thank you for watching.

1495
02:09:50,932 --> 02:09:52,233
See you next time.

1496
02:10:22,182 --> 02:10:23,422
Thank you for watching!

1497
02:10:45,262 --> 02:10:46,602
Thank you for watching!

1498
02:11:20,515 --> 02:11:25,659
[SPEAKER_20]: Song number three, Schwerstein, and that was actually called Festerlove, not Fasterlove.

1499
02:11:25,699 --> 02:11:26,940
[SPEAKER_20]: I fucked that up when I was announcing it.

1500
02:11:26,960 --> 02:11:27,620
[SPEAKER_20]: It's Festerlove.

1501
02:11:27,920 --> 02:11:31,303
[SPEAKER_20]: I have a strange feeling that Jamie picked that one on purpose with the holiday tomorrow.

1502
02:11:31,463 --> 02:11:31,823
[SPEAKER_20]: I don't know.

1503
02:11:32,604 --> 02:11:32,904
[SPEAKER_20]: Angel.

1504
02:11:35,005 --> 02:11:37,347
[SPEAKER_11]: It was okay.

1505
02:11:37,407 --> 02:11:39,569
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm not sure if that's it.

1506
02:11:40,790 --> 02:11:41,750
[SPEAKER_11]: She's seven.

1507
02:11:42,971 --> 02:11:43,291
[SPEAKER_17]: All right.

1508
02:11:44,292 --> 02:11:44,772
[SPEAKER_17]: Exquisite.

1509
02:11:45,793 --> 02:11:46,514
[SPEAKER_26]: You have to...

1510
02:11:47,392 --> 02:11:49,213
[SPEAKER_26]: I dub it Cher Takes Up Nose Whistling.

1511
02:11:49,253 --> 02:11:50,514
[SPEAKER_26]: It went on far too long.

1512
02:11:50,534 --> 02:11:50,634
[SPEAKER_26]: Three.

1513
02:11:50,694 --> 02:11:51,014
[SPEAKER_26]: Uh, Loki.

1514
02:12:14,600 --> 02:12:20,282
[SPEAKER_19]: If Cher were retarded and were to sing gothic music, that would be the song.

1515
02:12:21,602 --> 02:12:25,043
[SPEAKER_19]: So it gets a 2.

1516
02:12:25,303 --> 02:12:28,704
[SPEAKER_20]: That song, I kind of liked the beat a lot.

1517
02:12:29,764 --> 02:12:33,005
[SPEAKER_20]: So that was really cool, and I was all into the song when it first started.

1518
02:12:33,025 --> 02:12:37,466
[SPEAKER_20]: But the guy's voice, if emo were on a scale of 0 to 10, he was like a 15.

1519
02:12:37,586 --> 02:12:40,947
[SPEAKER_20]: It just made me want to slit my wrist.

1520
02:12:41,417 --> 02:12:45,358
[SPEAKER_20]: So, I don't know, I guess I would give it like a... Six and a half?

1521
02:12:45,578 --> 02:12:46,058
[SPEAKER_20]: Eh, seven.

1522
02:12:46,138 --> 02:12:47,098
[SPEAKER_20]: I'll give it a seven overall.

1523
02:12:48,079 --> 02:12:52,640
[SPEAKER_20]: I mean, I like the music a lot, it was just the guy's voice was kind of like, oh god, ah, wow.

1524
02:12:53,080 --> 02:12:56,841
[SPEAKER_20]: Alright, so remember though, it isn't up to us, it's up to you guys in the chatroom.

1525
02:12:57,201 --> 02:12:59,182
[SPEAKER_20]: So here it is, a recap, and then you can vote.

1526
02:12:59,282 --> 02:13:03,163
[SPEAKER_20]: Song number one you can vote for tonight is last week's winner, Freeze Pop with Stakeout.

02:13:09,963 --> 02:13:14,046
[SPEAKER_20]: And song number two you can vote for tonight is Echoing Green, Story of Our Lives.

1529
02:13:27,875 --> 02:13:34,139
[SPEAKER_14]: And song number three you can vote for tonight is Schwarzstein, Fester Love.

1530
02:13:35,888 --> 02:13:39,470
[SPEAKER_20]: Alright guys, place vote now.

1531

02:13:44,273 --> 02:13:48,856
[SPEAKER_20]: And we will tally all those votes up and let you guys know who the winner is very soon.

1533
02:13:50,277 --> 02:13:54,019
[SPEAKER_20]: In the meantime, Loki, what's going on in the sim scene right now?

1534
02:13:56,341 --> 02:14:03,105
[SPEAKER_19]: You know, I hate to say this, but nothing, absolutely nada is happening in the sim scene right now.

1535
02:14:04,146 --> 02:14:04,686
[SPEAKER_19]: I can't even...

1536
02:14:05,757 --> 02:14:10,360
[SPEAKER_19]: I can't really even comment on anything that's going on because really there's nothing going on.

1537
02:14:10,520 --> 02:14:10,860
[SPEAKER_19]: Nothing.

1538
02:14:10,980 --> 02:14:11,220
[SPEAKER_19]: Zip.

1539
02:14:12,041 --> 02:14:12,781
[SPEAKER_19]: No tournaments.

1540
02:14:13,442 --> 02:14:14,442
[SPEAKER_19]: No files.

1541
02:14:15,563 --> 02:14:16,123
[SPEAKER_19]: No nothing.

1542
02:14:16,204 --> 02:14:17,084
[SPEAKER_19]: Just nothing.

1543
02:14:18,545 --> 02:14:22,828
[SPEAKER_19]: However, however, I will take this time to play you one little song.

1544
02:14:23,668 --> 02:14:28,611
[SPEAKER_19]: Because this is a sim file and yes, it's one of those ones I downloaded.

1545
02:14:28,751 --> 02:14:29,071
[SPEAKER_19]: Why?

1546
02:14:29,192 --> 02:14:31,713
[SPEAKER_19]: Because it says Max 300 Remix.

1547
02:14:32,894 --> 02:14:34,695
[SPEAKER_19]: So why do I... I thought you hated those Maxes.

1548
02:14:35,294 --> 02:14:36,696
[SPEAKER_19]: I have to listen to every single one.

1549
02:14:36,856 --> 02:14:40,180
[SPEAKER_19]: It is my duty to listen to them just in case there's a good one.

1550
02:14:40,280 --> 02:14:42,843
[SPEAKER_19]: And honestly, that happens every now and then.

1551
02:14:43,363 --> 02:14:49,230
[SPEAKER_19]: So, this song, for your listening pleasure, is Max Vagina.

1552
02:14:50,211 --> 02:14:50,712
[SPEAKER_19]: That's right.

1553
02:14:51,172 --> 02:14:52,093
[SPEAKER_19]: Max Vagina.

1554
02:14:52,293 --> 02:14:52,654
[SPEAKER_19]: Enjoy.

1555
02:14:52,674 --> 02:14:53,835
[SPEAKER_19]: Max Vagina.

1556
02:16:39,349 --> 02:16:43,311
[SPEAKER_20]: So yeah, that's what's going on in the sim scene right there.

1557
02:16:43,371 --> 02:16:45,793
[SPEAKER_20]: Explicit, did you get a boner with that song?

1558
02:16:45,853 --> 02:16:47,274
[SPEAKER_24]: I was about to say that, no!

1559
02:16:48,815 --> 02:16:49,495
[SPEAKER_24]: It struck more.

1560
02:16:50,856 --> 02:16:52,237
[SPEAKER_24]: What the hell was that?

1561
02:16:52,677 --> 02:16:55,559
[SPEAKER_24]: Seriously, what was that?

1562
02:16:55,599 --> 02:16:56,840
[SPEAKER_26]: I can explain what that is.

1563
02:16:57,500 --> 02:16:59,061
[SPEAKER_26]: I know where the sources are from, it

1564
02:16:59,676 --> 02:17:01,896
[SPEAKER_26]: Okay, first I take away... Wait a minute, wait a minute.

1565
02:17:01,916 --> 02:17:03,857
[SPEAKER_20]: Is this why you had to give up the boner thing for Lent?

1566
02:17:06,798 --> 02:17:07,798
[SPEAKER_26]: I'm not gonna comment from that.

1567
02:17:08,538 --> 02:17:09,598
[SPEAKER_26]: It's not even close.

1568
02:17:09,658 --> 02:17:12,459
[SPEAKER_26]: Because there's no visuals.

1569
02:17:12,619 --> 02:17:13,979
[SPEAKER_26]: Sound effects, okay, I can handle.

1570
02:17:14,599 --> 02:17:21,221
[SPEAKER_26]: I can hear... All the time without getting a boner, but... Visuals... Is where it comes from.

1571
02:17:21,341 --> 02:17:22,521
[SPEAKER_26]: Anyways, back to the story.

1572
02:17:23,041 --> 02:17:24,201
[SPEAKER_26]: Lent was crap.

1573
02:17:24,781 --> 02:17:26,522
[SPEAKER_26]: I know the sources where it came from.

1574
02:17:26,602 --> 02:17:27,362
[SPEAKER_26]: It's basically Max150...

1575
02:17:32,237 --> 02:17:49,937
[SPEAKER_26]: and I think the sound effects that were like the porno sounds is from the video the porno video from City Crawford I actually have that DVD too it's from a song by a group called the Porno Rockers that's the group name um

1576
02:17:52,000 --> 02:17:55,242
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, it's just like, you know, I don't know.

1577
02:17:55,262 --> 02:17:56,904
[SPEAKER_19]: It's more like a cut and paste issue.

1578
02:17:57,244 --> 02:18:00,446
[SPEAKER_19]: I download that stuff just because, you know, it's fun to hear.

1579
02:18:00,866 --> 02:18:05,610
[SPEAKER_19]: You just have to listen to them because you don't really realize how bad they are.

1580
02:18:06,130 --> 02:18:07,791
[SPEAKER_19]: But then again, those are funny sometimes.

1581
02:18:08,732 --> 02:18:12,054
[SPEAKER_20]: To the person who made that, screw you.

1582
02:18:12,415 --> 02:18:15,557
[SPEAKER_20]: Seriously, sorry, but what the hell was that?

1583
02:18:16,738 --> 02:18:45,699
[SPEAKER_19]: You can think, BanzaiGTV Oh, I know, I've seen this guy remixed, okay And he has done other sim files also, like Sabrina, a step file announcer, which is someone on But we have Paranoia Extreme Rock Mix, Twinkle Twinkle Shocking Star, the Sailor Moon theme Yeah, he's got quite a bit of stuff he's done, but whatever

1584
02:18:46,829 --> 02:18:48,049
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't know, I thought that was funny.

1585
02:18:48,389 --> 02:18:52,191
[SPEAKER_26]: This is why I stopped downloading stuff from Be Mighty Star, unless they're good quality.

1586
02:18:53,911 --> 02:18:59,953
[SPEAKER_26]: I'm sick and tired of hearing Max remixes that are cut and paste, that sound like too much cut and paste.

1587
02:19:01,473 --> 02:19:03,334
[SPEAKER_17]: All I have to say is dot, dot, dot.

1588
02:19:04,934 --> 02:19:06,815
[SPEAKER_20]: You guys want to find out who won tonight's cage match?

1589
02:19:07,955 --> 02:19:08,535
[SPEAKER_17]: You ready to know?

1590
02:19:08,555 --> 02:19:10,376
[SPEAKER_17]: Alright, here it is.

1591
02:19:11,096 --> 02:19:14,817
[SPEAKER_20]: Winning song of tonight's cage match as determined by your votes...

1592
02:19:17,765 --> 02:19:18,986
[SPEAKER_20]: Freeze Pop!

1593
02:19:20,167 --> 02:19:23,349
[SPEAKER_20]: Two weeks in a row, Freeze Pop wins tonight.

1594
02:19:24,490 --> 02:19:26,591
[SPEAKER_20]: Not very many votes ahead of the other two, though.

1595
02:19:26,792 --> 02:19:28,153
[SPEAKER_20]: Kind of surprising, it was kind of close.

1596
02:19:28,213 --> 02:19:33,096
[SPEAKER_20]: A lot more votes for songs two and three than I would have guessed from the initial chatroom feedback.

1597
02:19:34,717 --> 02:19:39,741
[SPEAKER_20]: Some very interesting thoughts there in the chatroom.

1598
02:19:40,276 --> 02:19:41,397
[SPEAKER_20]: Anyway, we're going to go to a break.

1599
02:19:42,337 --> 02:19:46,760
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm out of theme ideas for this break, so I think we're just going to play random stuff in this break.

1600
02:19:48,301 --> 02:19:52,444
[SPEAKER_20]: We'll come back after this with more Orange Lounge Radio, including the FUs of the week.

1601
02:19:53,204 --> 02:19:57,887
[SPEAKER_20]: I want to do a little more Skype later on if we can, etc., etc.

1602
02:19:57,988 --> 02:20:00,909
[SPEAKER_20]: So in this break, we'll start off with The Shining Polaris.

1603
02:20:00,949 --> 02:20:01,870
[SPEAKER_20]: We haven't played this song in a while.

1604
02:20:02,130 --> 02:20:02,911
[SPEAKER_20]: We'll be back after this.

1605
02:20:03,791 --> 02:20:04,532

1619
02:27:47,113 --> 02:27:48,194
[SPEAKER_20]: We just wrapped up the cage match.

1620
02:27:48,214 --> 02:27:49,434
[SPEAKER_20]: We're going to move into the FUs of the Week.

1621
02:27:50,120 --> 02:28:02,269
[SPEAKER_20]: However, what we're going to do now is actually, I wanted to talk to some folks, some friends of the show, because I figured, you know, it's Valentine's Day and this would be an appropriate theme to do, right?

1622
02:28:02,670 --> 02:28:05,752
[SPEAKER_20]: We're going to talk to an actual DDR couple.

1623
02:28:07,433 --> 02:28:08,354
[SPEAKER_20]: Isn't this going to be nice?

1624
02:28:08,494 --> 02:28:09,375
[SPEAKER_20]: Alright, let's talk to them.

1625
02:28:09,415 --> 02:28:10,916
[SPEAKER_20]: Let me give them a call and see if they pick up.

1626
02:28:12,197 --> 02:28:15,079
[SPEAKER_20]: I figured something to fit with the theme of the holiday coming up.

1627
02:28:15,700 --> 02:28:16,280
[SPEAKER_20]: One ringy dingy.

1628
02:28:21,597 --> 02:28:22,558
[SPEAKER_21]: Hello?

1629
02:28:24,178 --> 02:28:24,639
[SPEAKER_29]: Hello?

1630
02:28:24,899 --> 02:28:25,399
[SPEAKER_21]: Hello?

1631
02:28:26,880 --> 02:28:28,641
[SPEAKER_20]: Hi, is this Jason and Raichan?

1632
02:28:29,301 --> 02:28:30,041
[SPEAKER_18]: It may be.

1633
02:28:31,342 --> 02:28:32,102
[SPEAKER_20]: I think it is.

1634
02:28:32,683 --> 02:28:33,003
[SPEAKER_18]: It is.

1635
02:28:33,223 --> 02:28:33,943
[SPEAKER_20]: How are you guys?

1636
02:28:34,464 --> 02:28:35,124
[SPEAKER_18]: We're pretty good.

1637
02:28:35,664 --> 02:28:37,645
[SPEAKER_20]: Happy Valentine's Day a little early to you guys.

1638
02:28:38,165 --> 02:28:39,146
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you, Rob.

1639
02:28:39,306 --> 02:28:41,787
[SPEAKER_20]: Now, you guys are under the same roof right now, correct?

1640
02:28:42,268 --> 02:28:42,468
[SPEAKER_18]: Yep.

1641
02:28:42,788 --> 02:28:43,208
[SPEAKER_18]: Thankfully.

1642
02:28:44,184 --> 02:28:45,345
[SPEAKER_20]: Awww, so cute.

1643
02:28:45,745 --> 02:28:50,428
[SPEAKER_20]: Because now, for those that don't know, you guys are kind of doing one of those long-distance thingy-thingies, right?

1644
02:28:50,908 --> 02:28:51,128
[SPEAKER_13]: Yep.

1645
02:28:51,648 --> 02:28:54,730
[SPEAKER_20]: So you have to travel once in a while to see each other, so... Yep.

1646
02:28:55,030 --> 02:28:56,191
[SPEAKER_20]: That's what's going on right now.

1647
02:28:56,591 --> 02:29:01,754
[SPEAKER_20]: Well, with the holiday coming up, and I can't help but think of all those threads on DDR Freak that goes...

1648
02:29:02,344 --> 02:29:05,127
[SPEAKER_20]: Oh my gods, how do I meet a girlfriend playing DDR?

1649
02:29:05,767 --> 02:29:11,473
[SPEAKER_20]: So I just thought maybe you guys could share a little bit about how you guys met and how it moved on, everything like that.

1650
02:29:11,493 --> 02:29:14,055
[SPEAKER_20]: If you could give us a little history of your guys' relationship.

1651
02:29:16,217 --> 02:29:19,180
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, see, me being a whole Southwest moderator...

1652
02:29:22,230 --> 02:29:23,730
[SPEAKER_18]: Slurred over private messages.

1653
02:29:44,105 --> 02:29:50,970
[SPEAKER_18]: and me being the good, dutiful moderator had to tell her that, hey, right-hand, your images are too big.

1654
02:29:51,110 --> 02:29:52,391
[SPEAKER_18]: Could you link them for me, please?

1655
02:29:54,152 --> 02:29:59,736
[SPEAKER_18]: And as soon as I did that, I was rummaging around LiveJournal and apparently she knew one of my friends as well.

1656
02:30:00,317 --> 02:30:05,881
[SPEAKER_18]: I saw her avatar and a picture and a comment and we just kind of started talking.

1657
02:30:06,826 --> 02:30:13,048
[SPEAKER_01]: And you actually forgot to mention the fact that in that PM it said, I hate to cover up such a pretty face.

1658
02:30:13,128 --> 02:30:15,289
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh, of course, you have to have that.

1659
02:30:15,989 --> 02:30:16,970
[SPEAKER_20]: Oh, la la la.

1660
02:30:17,130 --> 02:30:17,930
[SPEAKER_20]: Oh, that's so cute.

1661
02:30:20,471 --> 02:30:22,752
[SPEAKER_20]: Right, Chan, what was your reaction when you got the private message?

1662
02:30:22,872 --> 02:30:25,253
[SPEAKER_20]: Were you like, ah, who's this weirdo hitting on me, or what?

1663
02:30:25,913 --> 02:30:27,714
[SPEAKER_01]: At that point, I didn't see it as that.

1664
02:30:27,814 --> 02:30:32,256
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind of amusing, because I was still, oh my god, it's the moderator, he's messaging me.

1665
02:30:36,590 --> 02:30:40,132
[SPEAKER_20]: So you guys didn't meet necessarily at an arcade or anything.

1666
02:30:40,172 --> 02:30:42,033
[SPEAKER_20]: You actually met through the online forums.

1667
02:30:42,954 --> 02:30:44,475
[SPEAKER_20]: So what was the first time you guys met in person?

1668
02:30:46,776 --> 02:30:47,596
[SPEAKER_18]: November 1st.

1669
02:30:47,736 --> 02:30:49,077
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes, the night after Halloween.

1670
02:30:50,178 --> 02:30:50,758
[SPEAKER_20]: How did it work out?

1671
02:30:50,798 --> 02:30:51,459
[SPEAKER_20]: How did you guys meet?

1672
02:30:51,519 --> 02:30:52,099
[SPEAKER_20]: How did it all happen?

1673
02:30:53,160 --> 02:30:57,202
[SPEAKER_18]: I was going to take a trip up to Colorado, and I did.

1674
02:30:58,823 --> 02:30:59,903
[SPEAKER_20]: It's just that simple, huh?

1675
02:31:00,444 --> 02:31:00,884
[SPEAKER_18]: Pretty much.

1676
02:31:01,805 --> 02:31:04,186
[SPEAKER_20]: Wow, well, you make interviewing really easy then.

1677
02:31:04,734 --> 02:31:08,857
[SPEAKER_20]: I must get dead pleasing.

1678
02:31:10,098 --> 02:31:14,001
[SPEAKER_18]: Officially, it would be, what, a year and a month now?

1679
02:31:14,562 --> 02:31:21,166
[SPEAKER_18]: And that was only three months before when we first met, so one year and four months now, and one year and one month officially.

1680
02:31:21,186 --> 02:31:22,968
[SPEAKER_20]: Mm-hmm.

1681
02:31:27,256 --> 02:31:30,578
[SPEAKER_20]: So do you guys play DDR together or any of that dorky stuff?

1682
02:31:30,658 --> 02:31:32,779
[SPEAKER_20]: Or what do you guys, is DDR just kind of there?

1683
02:31:32,840 --> 02:31:34,440
[SPEAKER_20]: It's just an interest you guys both have?

1684
02:31:34,501 --> 02:31:38,863
[SPEAKER_20]: Or do you sometimes go out and do the nerdy Bomani things together, like travel to arcades?

1685
02:31:38,903 --> 02:31:39,644
[SPEAKER_20]: Or what do you guys do?

1686
02:31:39,684 --> 02:31:42,185
[SPEAKER_01]: Yesterday I went to MGL.

1687
02:31:42,345 --> 02:31:44,187
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, mostly Jason Blade.

1688
02:31:44,527 --> 02:31:46,868
[SPEAKER_01]: The night before that we went and played some 2DX.

1689
02:31:47,609 --> 02:31:48,689
[SPEAKER_01]: Played a little bit of DDR.

1690
02:31:49,210 --> 02:31:51,011
[SPEAKER_01]: Beatmania 3, Dance Maniacs.

1691
02:31:52,412 --> 02:31:54,413
[SPEAKER_20]: Do you guys have little competitions or anything like that?

1692
02:31:55,854 --> 02:31:57,275
[SPEAKER_18]: She owns me in home versions.

1693
02:31:57,716 --> 02:32:00,178
[SPEAKER_18]: I usually do it a little bit better in the arcade, but not always.

1694
02:32:01,039 --> 02:32:01,900
[SPEAKER_20]: Oh, that's kind of cute.

1695
02:32:02,481 --> 02:32:02,621
Yeah.

1696
02:32:03,461 --> 02:32:04,703
[SPEAKER_20]: Any plans for the big day tomorrow?

1697
02:32:06,544 --> 02:32:12,330
[SPEAKER_18]: Going to work, unfortunately for me, but I'm going to go in early so I can get out early and take her out to dinner or something really nice.

1698
02:32:12,590 --> 02:32:15,093
[SPEAKER_20]: Did somebody say fucking in the microphone?

1699
02:32:16,354 --> 02:32:17,075
[SPEAKER_20]: Shame on you.

1700
02:32:17,135 --> 02:32:18,136
[SPEAKER_20]: This is a family show.

1701
02:32:19,433 --> 02:32:21,874
[SPEAKER_20]: Bug just... Was that Angel?

1702
02:32:22,255 --> 02:32:23,295
[SPEAKER_20]: Angel did that?

1703
02:32:23,355 --> 02:32:23,575
[SPEAKER_20]: No.

1704
02:32:24,076 --> 02:32:24,596
[SPEAKER_20]: It was Bug.

1705
02:32:24,836 --> 02:32:26,377
[SPEAKER_20]: Bug was whispering in the microphone.

1706
02:32:26,698 --> 02:32:30,020
[SPEAKER_20]: Fucking... He probably just couldn't hear it.

1707
02:32:32,341 --> 02:32:33,742
[SPEAKER_20]: That's none of your business.

1708
02:32:33,983 --> 02:32:34,883
[SPEAKER_20]: That's none of your business.

1709
02:32:34,903 --> 02:32:35,944
[SPEAKER_20]: Don't you know that's rude?

1710
02:32:37,565 --> 02:32:38,145
[SPEAKER_02]: Damn straight.

1711
02:32:38,606 --> 02:32:39,046
[SPEAKER_20]: Sides.

1712
02:32:40,107 --> 02:32:42,829
[SPEAKER_20]: We all know they're going to stay virginal until they get married.

1713
02:32:43,549 --> 02:32:43,829
[SPEAKER_20]: Right?

1714
02:32:44,430 --> 02:32:44,630
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah.

1715
02:32:44,910 --> 02:32:45,430
[SPEAKER_20]: Okay, anyway.

1716
02:32:46,711 --> 02:32:47,652
[SPEAKER_20]: Let's change the topic.

1717
02:32:50,864 --> 02:32:53,365
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought I already changed the topic right there.

1718
02:32:53,585 --> 02:33:01,511
[SPEAKER_20]: Do you guys have any advice for those guys out there that are all sad because of the Valentine's Day holiday and all they want is a gamer girlfriend?

1719
02:33:01,591 --> 02:33:02,531
[SPEAKER_20]: Do you guys have any advice?

1720
02:33:03,392 --> 02:33:04,293
[SPEAKER_18]: Stop whining.

1721
02:33:04,693 --> 02:33:05,694
[SPEAKER_18]: Stop bitching.

1722
02:33:06,214 --> 02:33:08,475
[SPEAKER_18]: Stop obsessing.

1723
02:33:09,096 --> 02:33:13,719
[SPEAKER_18]: And be yourself and try opening your mouth and shutting it normally.

1724
02:33:14,219 --> 02:33:16,321
[SPEAKER_19]: And commit suicide.

1725
02:33:16,421 --> 02:33:17,261
[SPEAKER_29]: Amen to all that.

1726
02:33:17,341 --> 02:33:18,022
[SPEAKER_20]: Stop it, Loki.

1727
02:33:18,302 --> 02:33:18,682
[SPEAKER_20]: Stop it.

1728
02:33:19,142 --> 02:33:19,763
[SPEAKER_20]: And buy lots of lube.

1729
02:33:21,844 --> 02:33:25,207
[SPEAKER_20]: She's also had people try hitting on me through her.

1730
02:33:50,766 --> 02:33:53,667
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, they express their, uh, fads.

1731
02:33:54,487 --> 02:33:59,269
[SPEAKER_18]: I wouldn't say, no, not fantasies, but they express their heavy likes for me.

1732
02:33:59,749 --> 02:34:00,589
[SPEAKER_18]: Other guys, yes.

1733
02:34:01,690 --> 02:34:03,790
[SPEAKER_17]: And I apologize profusely about that, Jason.

1734
02:34:04,490 --> 02:34:07,091
[SPEAKER_18]: It's okay, Rob.

1735
02:34:07,111 --> 02:34:07,831
[SPEAKER_18]: We know you're on it.

1736
02:34:08,632 --> 02:34:16,074
[SPEAKER_19]: All these nerdy people need to do is just rent a porno, get a nice dinner, and it's like a date right there.

1737
02:34:18,567 --> 02:34:18,967
[SPEAKER_14]: Wow.

1738
02:34:47,523 --> 02:34:49,265
[SPEAKER_18]: For some reason, I failed to be surprised.

1739
02:34:49,285 --> 02:34:52,968
[SPEAKER_20]: I mean, I know it firsthand, though.

1740
02:34:52,988 --> 02:34:53,188
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

1741
02:35:17,012 --> 02:35:20,556
[SPEAKER_20]: No, actually, I got invited to a gay singles dinner.

1742
02:35:21,918 --> 02:35:24,701
[SPEAKER_20]: How gay is that in the overview?

1743
02:35:26,223 --> 02:35:28,345
[SPEAKER_20]: But yeah, definitely, I'm going, obviously.

1744
02:35:28,846 --> 02:35:31,609
[SPEAKER_20]: It's one of my buddies that's having it, so I'm like, okay, yeah, it sounds like fun.

1745
02:35:32,850 --> 02:35:34,632
[SPEAKER_20]: So there's something for everybody on Valentine's Day.

1746
02:35:35,053 --> 02:35:35,233
[SPEAKER_20]: What?

1747
02:35:36,141 --> 02:35:38,823
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm sure you'll have a gay old time.

1748
02:35:38,923 --> 02:35:43,507
[SPEAKER_20]: I will, and then I'm going to come home and masturbate until the sun rises next day.

1749
02:35:43,907 --> 02:35:44,688
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm kidding, I'm kidding.

1750
02:35:44,708 --> 02:35:45,649
[SPEAKER_20]: Thanks for the details.

1751
02:35:45,749 --> 02:35:47,210
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm kidding, I'm kidding, I'm totally kidding.

1752
02:35:48,051 --> 02:35:50,673
[SPEAKER_20]: Anything else you guys want to share about... You don't have that much stamina.

1753
02:35:51,554 --> 02:35:51,874
[SPEAKER_20]: Shut up.

1754
02:35:52,354 --> 02:35:53,735
[SPEAKER_20]: Anything else you guys want to share?

1755
02:35:54,096 --> 02:35:57,178
[SPEAKER_20]: Any exciting things going on this week while she's paying a visit?

1756
02:35:59,300 --> 02:36:03,303
[SPEAKER_18]: For some reason I keep thinking she's going to leave on Saturday, but she's actually here until Tuesday.

1757
02:36:03,924 --> 02:36:05,345
[SPEAKER_18]: And so that's making me happy every day.

1758
02:36:05,365 --> 02:36:05,665
[SPEAKER_18]: I think I'm

1759
02:36:06,908 --> 02:36:09,109
[SPEAKER_20]: Aw, you were cutting out for half that sentence, but that's okay.

1760
02:36:09,129 --> 02:36:09,729
[SPEAKER_20]: It's still cute.

1761
02:36:10,249 --> 02:36:14,511
[SPEAKER_18]: We're trying to share a headset to the best of our ability.

1762
02:36:14,931 --> 02:36:15,311
[SPEAKER_20]: Oh, I see.

1763
02:36:15,331 --> 02:36:15,751
[SPEAKER_20]: That's cool.

1764
02:36:16,712 --> 02:36:20,073
[SPEAKER_20]: Rai-Chan, any plans for this week?

1765
02:36:21,614 --> 02:36:22,134
[SPEAKER_01]: Not really.

1766
02:36:22,894 --> 02:36:24,195
[SPEAKER_20]: Just enjoying each other's company?

1767
02:36:24,215 --> 02:36:25,795
[SPEAKER_18]: Spend it normally, like our advice says.

1768
02:36:26,215 --> 02:36:26,515
[SPEAKER_20]: Okay.

1769
02:36:26,856 --> 02:36:27,336
[SPEAKER_20]: That's cool.

1770
02:36:27,616 --> 02:36:28,076
[SPEAKER_20]: Works for me.

1771
02:36:28,096 --> 02:36:29,116
[SPEAKER_20]: All right, you guys.

1772
02:36:29,316 --> 02:36:32,057
[SPEAKER_20]: Thanks for letting us bug you, and have a happy Valentine's Day, okay?

1773
02:36:32,117 --> 02:36:32,778
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you, Rob.

1774
02:36:32,798 --> 02:36:33,358
[SPEAKER_20]: You're welcome.

1775
02:36:33,378 --> 02:36:33,558
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you.

1776
02:36:33,925 --> 02:36:34,445
[SPEAKER_20]: Bye.

1777
02:36:34,525 --> 02:36:34,925
[SPEAKER_20]: Kisses.

1778
02:36:35,266 --> 02:36:36,126
[SPEAKER_20]: Bye-bye.

1779
02:36:36,406 --> 02:36:38,847
[SPEAKER_20]: It was nice to talk to them.

1780
02:36:39,247 --> 02:36:39,487
[SPEAKER_20]: What?

1781
02:36:40,367 --> 02:36:41,548
[SPEAKER_02]: None of us here are bitter, right?

1782
02:36:42,828 --> 02:36:43,329
[SPEAKER_20]: Let's see.

1783
02:36:44,409 --> 02:36:49,631
[SPEAKER_20]: Single, single, single, dating, engaged.

1784
02:36:50,451 --> 02:36:50,911
[SPEAKER_00]: Bitch boy.

1785
02:36:53,272 --> 02:36:55,693
[SPEAKER_20]: So we got mostly single, but anyway.

1786
02:36:57,194 --> 02:36:57,474
[SPEAKER_20]: Oh, well.

1787
02:37:00,157 --> 02:37:02,298
[SPEAKER_20]: What we're going to do now is we're going to get into another segment.

1788
02:37:02,338 --> 02:37:09,083
[SPEAKER_20]: I thought it would be very good to follow up the very lovey-dovey, aw, isn't that cute segment with one of our favorite segments, the FUs of the week.

1789
02:37:10,824 --> 02:37:13,786
[SPEAKER_20]: So what we're going to do now is get into those FUs of the week.

1790
02:37:14,046 --> 02:37:17,989
[SPEAKER_20]: This is the part, oh, by the way, if you guys want to send in an FU of the week, just send me a private message.

1791
02:37:18,089 --> 02:37:23,412
[SPEAKER_20]: My name is Sky in the chat room with your FU, but please try to keep it somewhat reasonable in length.

1792
02:37:23,772 --> 02:37:26,094
[SPEAKER_20]: If it's too long, I'm going to cut it short because I can do that.

1793
02:37:28,573 --> 02:37:30,174
[SPEAKER_20]: That includes you in studio.

1794
02:37:31,855 --> 02:37:37,340
[SPEAKER_20]: So this is the part where I would normally ask Jamie, why do we do the FUs of the week every single week?

1795
02:37:37,400 --> 02:37:41,323
[SPEAKER_20]: But she's not here, so I'm going to ask Loki, why is it we do the FUs of the week every single week?

1796
02:37:42,524 --> 02:37:43,524
[SPEAKER_20]: Because we have anger.

1797
02:37:50,149 --> 02:37:51,931
Oh, this is bad.

1798
02:37:52,011 --> 02:37:52,551
Here is justice.

1799
02:37:52,651 --> 02:37:53,932
[SPEAKER_14]: Here is punishment.

1800
02:37:59,835 --> 02:38:04,456
[SPEAKER_20]: Even though DarkSakura is not here tonight, she's spending the time with her boyfriend.

1801
02:38:04,496 --> 02:38:06,857
[SPEAKER_20]: She did want me to enter in an FU on behalf.

1802
02:38:07,217 --> 02:38:08,997
[SPEAKER_20]: She would like to give an FU to people.

1803
02:38:09,497 --> 02:38:10,398
[SPEAKER_20]: In general, everybody.

1804
02:38:11,298 --> 02:38:11,898
[SPEAKER_20]: So there you go.

1805
02:38:12,138 --> 02:38:13,238
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll give an FU straight back.

1806
02:38:13,778 --> 02:38:14,078
[SPEAKER_20]: Alright.

1807
02:38:14,999 --> 02:38:15,839
[SPEAKER_20]: Loki's turn!

1808
02:38:18,319 --> 02:38:18,820
[SPEAKER_19]: Fuck you, dude.

1809
02:38:18,840 --> 02:38:22,981
[SPEAKER_19]: The company that sold me the goddamn battery for my Orange Box PC.

1810
02:38:23,481 --> 02:38:26,041
[SPEAKER_19]: Because the battery is defective.

1811
02:38:26,281 --> 02:38:27,402
[SPEAKER_19]: It will not charge.

1812
02:38:27,562 --> 02:38:28,842
[SPEAKER_19]: In fact, um...

1813
02:38:29,580 --> 02:38:34,725
[SPEAKER_19]: It charges, according to the battery, about only 75% of the way, because only three of the four lights are on there.

1814
02:38:35,445 --> 02:38:40,590
[SPEAKER_19]: And not only that, when I was trying to charge it and plugging it in, it's all sparky now, the little bottom thing.

1815
02:38:41,090 --> 02:38:42,892
[SPEAKER_19]: So that's probably not a good sign either.

1816
02:38:43,393 --> 02:38:49,316
[SPEAKER_19]: So anyways, so fuck you then, because that battery cost me almost $200, and that doesn't make me too happy.

1817
02:38:50,177 --> 02:39:05,585
[SPEAKER_19]: And then finally, fuck you to The Matrix Online, because I went to go play it yesterday, just to give it a second go around, and it was admins only on that one server I was on, so I said fuck it, I'm tired of this.

1818
02:39:07,116 --> 02:39:08,137
[SPEAKER_19]: So I'm not going to play it.

1819
02:39:09,258 --> 02:39:13,183
[SPEAKER_19]: And it sucks for me for not having any money.

1820
02:39:13,243 --> 02:39:16,927
[SPEAKER_19]: So fuck it to me for spending my money on useless shit that I don't need.

1821
02:39:17,407 --> 02:39:18,548
[SPEAKER_19]: A.K.A.

1822
02:39:18,568 --> 02:39:19,669
[SPEAKER_19]: the Orange Box.

1823
02:39:20,550 --> 02:39:24,134
[SPEAKER_19]: And yeah, that's pretty much it right now.

1824
02:39:33,530 --> 02:39:52,223
[SPEAKER_20]: I'd like to give an F you to myself for being all fashion conscious last night and I was seriously being such a woman and I like changed my outfit like four times before I was willing to leave the house and I was like how does my hair look and I was making I was making Loki and his girlfriend like you know be my fashion judges or whatever so an F you to that.

1825
02:39:53,338 --> 02:39:53,519
[SPEAKER_20]: D.R.

1826
02:39:53,639 --> 02:39:53,839
[SPEAKER_20]: ANGEL

1827
02:40:09,693 --> 02:40:31,307
[SPEAKER_30]: Alright, uh, F you to me for, like, not watching my book more carefully this week, cause I had to get it swiped at least, you know, for 48 hours, and I got all, like, paranoid and, uh, stressed and all that crap, and so the book got, uh, returned to me on Thursday, and all that, so, screw that, um...

1828
02:40:32,779 --> 02:40:40,465
[SPEAKER_30]: F you to KTHR closing down because, um, you know, it was too soon, in my opinion.

1829
02:40:41,106 --> 02:40:44,048
[SPEAKER_30]: But, you know, there's nothing I can do about now, so screw that.

1830
02:40:44,308 --> 02:40:44,789
[SPEAKER_30]: Whatever.

1831
02:40:45,449 --> 02:40:47,931
[SPEAKER_30]: I'll live on, or, you know, I'll move on.

1832
02:40:48,592 --> 02:40:50,133
[SPEAKER_30]: And, uh, fuck you to being an I.L.

1833
02:40:50,153 --> 02:40:55,778
[SPEAKER_30]: because it just makes, you know, that alarm that much sooner to go off and it sucks.

1834
02:40:55,818 --> 02:40:56,198
[SPEAKER_30]: Whatever.

1835
02:40:56,218 --> 02:40:56,318
[SPEAKER_30]: Um...

1836
02:41:00,546 --> 02:41:01,386
[SPEAKER_30]: I guess that's about it.

1837
02:41:01,526 --> 02:41:02,586
[SPEAKER_30]: I don't really know.

1838
02:41:04,107 --> 02:41:06,527
[SPEAKER_30]: I lost my train of thought, so I guess it doesn't matter.

1839
02:41:07,948 --> 02:41:08,288
[SPEAKER_17]: Alright.

1840
02:41:08,488 --> 02:41:09,828
[SPEAKER_30]: So, whatever, I'm done.

1841
02:41:10,228 --> 02:41:11,929
[SPEAKER_17]: Alright, let's move on to Bud.

1842
02:41:11,949 --> 02:41:20,751
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you to myself, because I forgot to invite you to the after funeral party on Tuesday night.

1843
02:41:21,751 --> 02:41:22,891
[SPEAKER_02]: It was Jägermeister.

1844
02:41:23,531 --> 02:41:24,151
[SPEAKER_20]: You're in trouble.

1845
02:41:24,451 --> 02:41:25,011
[SPEAKER_20]: No, that's alright.

1846
02:41:25,051 --> 02:41:25,432
[SPEAKER_20]: It's cool.

1847
02:41:25,472 --> 02:41:25,912
[SPEAKER_20]: I understand.

1848
02:41:25,932 --> 02:41:26,652
[SPEAKER_20]: But, uh...

1849
02:41:27,699 --> 02:41:29,540
[SPEAKER_20]: Too bad all those people aren't still in town, though.

1850
02:41:29,920 --> 02:41:31,261
[SPEAKER_20]: I bet they'd love to see me now.

1851
02:41:31,801 --> 02:41:32,541
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm fabulous.

1852
02:41:33,061 --> 02:41:33,301
[SPEAKER_02]: What?

1853
02:41:33,462 --> 02:41:34,402
[SPEAKER_02]: Most of them are, actually.

1854
02:41:34,422 --> 02:41:35,923
[SPEAKER_02]: Most of them didn't actually leave town.

1855
02:41:36,203 --> 02:41:36,583
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh, really?

1856
02:41:36,603 --> 02:41:38,264
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh, we should all hang out or something.

1857
02:41:38,724 --> 02:41:39,424
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to try.

1858
02:41:39,964 --> 02:41:42,806
[SPEAKER_21]: But, uh... I'm a little different than I was in high school.

1859
02:41:43,166 --> 02:41:43,346
[SPEAKER_02]: Nah.

1860
02:41:43,526 --> 02:41:47,087
[SPEAKER_02]: I never would have guessed.

1861
02:41:47,188 --> 02:41:49,769
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, your flame's showing.

1862
02:41:50,049 --> 02:41:50,629
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh, sorry.

1863
02:41:52,350 --> 02:41:54,991
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh... F you to the barrier, DJ.

1864
02:41:55,011 --> 02:41:56,211
[SPEAKER_02]: You're so damn far away.

1865
02:41:56,912 --> 02:41:57,252
[SPEAKER_29]: Yeah.

1866
02:41:57,771 --> 02:41:58,231
[SPEAKER_29]: Agreed.

1867
02:41:58,511 --> 02:42:00,893
[SPEAKER_20]: I still want to know about this naked hot tubbing stuff.

1868
02:42:02,734 --> 02:42:03,814
[SPEAKER_21]: Whose place was this at?

1869
02:42:04,294 --> 02:42:06,776
[SPEAKER_21]: I can't tell you.

1870
02:42:06,856 --> 02:42:07,756
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay, alright, fine.

1871
02:42:08,597 --> 02:42:12,238
[SPEAKER_02]: There was a dual G5 Power Mac involved, too.

1872
02:42:13,139 --> 02:42:14,219
[SPEAKER_21]: Power Mac, okay.

1873
02:42:15,520 --> 02:42:15,900
[SPEAKER_21]: Hot.

1874
02:42:15,920 --> 02:42:17,481
[SPEAKER_21]: Alright.

1875
02:42:18,702 --> 02:42:19,122
[SPEAKER_21]: Fair enough.

1876
02:42:19,982 --> 02:42:22,984
[SPEAKER_02]: And, well, of course, the usual FUs to kill viruses.

1877
02:42:23,764 --> 02:42:23,944
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay.

1878
02:42:24,044 --> 02:42:26,465
[SPEAKER_02]: And not enough time in the fucking week.

1879
02:42:29,706 --> 02:42:30,406
[SPEAKER_21]: Fair enough.

1880
02:42:31,047 --> 02:42:32,128
[SPEAKER_21]: Alright, explicit.

1881
02:42:35,291 --> 02:42:43,218
[SPEAKER_26]: I want to give an FD to some white Ford Mustang for trying to run my ass over when it says walk on my part.

1882
02:42:43,438 --> 02:42:53,347
[SPEAKER_26]: When I'm walking in the pedestrian... No, I should not be run over just because you're in a damn hurry running 60 miles an hour and turning right on a red lane.

1883
02:42:54,028 --> 02:42:54,689
[SPEAKER_26]: My god, I...

1884
02:42:56,750 --> 02:43:02,032
[SPEAKER_26]: and FU2 and Zuma469 for causing a shitload of drama on the tournament, obviously.

1885
02:43:03,453 --> 02:43:06,895
[SPEAKER_26]: If you don't like the rules, don't even go to the tournaments.

1886
02:43:07,235 --> 02:43:09,776
[SPEAKER_26]: You send us to numerous tournaments and we're getting sick of it.

1887
02:43:10,616 --> 02:43:16,999
[SPEAKER_26]: You bring your drama, personal drama, that Team469 shouldn't even be involved, and you bring it in front of our faces.

1888
02:43:17,600 --> 02:43:18,280
[SPEAKER_26]: Look what happens.

1889
02:43:18,940 --> 02:43:19,801
[SPEAKER_26]: Now you're banned.

1890
02:43:20,721 --> 02:43:21,922
[SPEAKER_26]: Luckily we did not kick your ass.

1891
02:43:24,255 --> 02:43:27,779
[SPEAKER_26]: I want to give an F you for my video card from frying up like shit.

1892
02:43:29,942 --> 02:43:34,667
[SPEAKER_26]: Somehow, like, I think I started smelling smoke on my video card for Radeon 9800.

1893
02:43:34,747 --> 02:43:39,353
[SPEAKER_26]: I still have to fix the problem, but if I can't fix it, I have to...

1894
02:43:40,533 --> 02:43:54,718
[SPEAKER_26]: and FU2 whoever turned off my fucking firewall, now I got a fucking virus I can't even delete until I do some very good research towards it, because not even Adaware or any of those other programs could even check it out.

1895
02:43:57,179 --> 02:44:04,322
[SPEAKER_26]: FU2, whoever was spreading a fucking rumor about my family and stuff, that someone said that one of our family members hate each other, you know how much

1896
02:44:05,183 --> 02:44:09,084
[SPEAKER_26]: The pain that is for the family if someone ever hears that type of shit.

1897
02:44:10,324 --> 02:44:13,445
[SPEAKER_26]: It hurts, a lot of tears have been going through that type of issue.

1898
02:44:15,366 --> 02:44:19,127
[SPEAKER_26]: But luckily everything is solved and whoever said that type of shit should be killed.

1899
02:44:19,147 --> 02:44:20,927
[SPEAKER_26]: Most likely, honestly.

1900
02:44:21,708 --> 02:44:31,970
[SPEAKER_26]: FU2 being broke as hell because I spent a lot of money and now I owe like some people for the tournament since that's what some people say like the tournament got rigged over prizes.

1901
02:44:32,791 --> 02:44:33,731
[SPEAKER_26]: Get the fuck over it.

1902
02:44:34,750 --> 02:44:39,813
[SPEAKER_26]: and a few to losing a shitload of money on Friday at Thunder Valley Casino on Blackjack.

1903
02:44:40,734 --> 02:44:41,594
[SPEAKER_17]: That was me last week.

1904
02:44:43,415 --> 02:44:44,256
[SPEAKER_17]: Except not Blackjack.

1905
02:44:45,857 --> 02:44:50,540
[SPEAKER_26]: Well, in the fact, yeah, I lost fucking 90 bucks over fucking Blackjack itself.

1906
02:44:51,800 --> 02:44:53,721
[SPEAKER_26]: Some people can't even play fucking Blackjack pretty well.

1907
02:44:53,741 --> 02:44:55,462
[SPEAKER_26]: They hit them when they're not supposed to hit.

1908
02:44:56,707 --> 02:45:00,169
[SPEAKER_26]: Okay, if you see a six on the field, you're not supposed to fucking hit.

1909
02:45:00,569 --> 02:45:03,870
[SPEAKER_26]: You're supposed to leave it to stay because they know the dealer is in trouble.

1910
02:45:04,451 --> 02:45:05,771
[SPEAKER_26]: You hit and they give you 21.

1911
02:45:06,011 --> 02:45:06,952
[SPEAKER_26]: You get fucked over.

1912
02:45:07,332 --> 02:45:07,972
[SPEAKER_26]: Thanks a lot.

1913
02:45:09,273 --> 02:45:12,574
[SPEAKER_26]: And since it is a three-hour show, I want to say to be continued.

1914
02:45:13,495 --> 02:45:17,837
[SPEAKER_26]: My angst will never... Alright, alright.

1915
02:45:19,958 --> 02:45:25,300
[SPEAKER_20]: Alright, let's move on to the next segment, which would be the chatroom FUs.

1916
02:45:28,566 --> 02:45:48,467
[SPEAKER_20]: starting it off with MPQ in order of severity F you to the laggy broadcast F you to myself for inadvertently reformatting my hard drive twice in a week F you to my parents for losing the wireless network password and F you to my little sister for drawing on my laptop with a permanent marker dope

1917
02:45:50,017 --> 02:45:57,545
[SPEAKER_20]: DarkKnight says, I think this might be a running FU, but FU to Valentine's Day and being broke and single and having to work on Valentine's Day.

1918
02:45:58,847 --> 02:46:10,079
[SPEAKER_20]: Zaku says, FU to being worried about getting work, FU to Valentine's Day for being so discriminating to singles, and FU to having to wait until I'm employed so that I can buy the Bomani hardware I desire.

1919
02:46:11,514 --> 02:46:13,616
[SPEAKER_20]: Illusion says F you to Valentine's Day.

1920
02:46:13,756 --> 02:46:18,539
[SPEAKER_20]: Okay, I've got two girls that were in love with me, but they tell me this after they get a boyfriend.

1921
02:46:18,559 --> 02:46:19,120
[SPEAKER_20]: What the fuck?

1922
02:46:19,500 --> 02:46:25,985
[SPEAKER_20]: Anyway, I'm going to drown my Valentine's sorrow in a big tub of chocolate ice cream and multiple viewings of When Harry Met Sally.

1923
02:46:28,927 --> 02:46:39,474
[SPEAKER_20]: VXJasonXV and Rychan, since they're together in the same place right now, you know, they said, I guess we could say F you to anyone in advance that F you's Valentine's Day.

1924
02:46:43,129 --> 02:46:44,350
[SPEAKER_20]: Ouch, it's a clarin war there.

1925
02:46:45,971 --> 02:46:51,893
[SPEAKER_20]: RPGKing7 says, if you do get this FU, an FU to all the employers that won't hire me.

1926
02:46:52,013 --> 02:46:56,075
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm desperate for a job, but not male gigolo desperate.

1927
02:46:57,416 --> 02:47:01,298
[SPEAKER_20]: And an FU to losing all my PlayStation 2 data, and to Valentine's Day.

1928
02:47:05,219 --> 02:47:10,642
[SPEAKER_20]: StepEdOff1215 says, FU to constantly being broke and never being able to get anything I want.

1929
02:47:13,255 --> 02:47:19,882
[SPEAKER_20]: and Lama Juice says, F you to Red Octane for losing my order for my metal pad that I waited the two months for.

1930
02:47:21,624 --> 02:47:25,569
[SPEAKER_20]: And to Microsoft, because my Xbox isn't reading discs anymore.

1931
02:47:29,433 --> 02:47:32,376
[SPEAKER_20]: And Dork says, F you to Valentine's Day and girls.

1932
02:47:32,556 --> 02:47:34,078
[SPEAKER_20]: Insert frowny face here.

1933
02:47:35,353 --> 02:47:41,356
[SPEAKER_20]: Oh, I think that was a bit of a recurring theme there tonight, the FU to Valentine's Day.

1934
02:47:41,816 --> 02:47:42,016
[SPEAKER_20]: Yes?

1935
02:47:42,256 --> 02:47:45,377
[SPEAKER_30]: Hugs to DK, because that's not cool.

1936
02:47:45,597 --> 02:47:45,857
[SPEAKER_30]: Oh, well.

1937
02:47:45,957 --> 02:47:46,578
[SPEAKER_20]: What, just him?

1938
02:47:48,118 --> 02:47:48,699
[SPEAKER_20]: I know, I know.

1939
02:47:48,719 --> 02:47:51,200
[SPEAKER_20]: A lot of people are sad about Valentine's Day, though.

1940
02:47:51,900 --> 02:47:53,100
[SPEAKER_30]: Okay, hugs to you, too, then.

1941
02:47:53,460 --> 02:47:54,161
[SPEAKER_30]: There, better?

1942
02:47:54,641 --> 02:47:54,901
[SPEAKER_20]: Much.

1943
02:47:55,221 --> 02:47:55,521
[SPEAKER_30]: Okay.

1944
02:47:56,522 --> 02:47:56,822
[SPEAKER_20]: All right.

1945
02:47:58,803 --> 02:47:59,383
[SPEAKER_20]: Let's see.

1946
02:47:59,503 --> 02:48:01,064
[SPEAKER_20]: When the hell is that you're watching, Loki?

1947
02:48:01,084 --> 02:48:03,705
[SPEAKER_20]: It looks like some public access production of Superman.

1948
02:48:03,725 --> 02:48:04,205
[SPEAKER_20]: What is this?

1949
02:48:05,546 --> 02:48:06,666
[SPEAKER_19]: It's the world's finest.

1950
02:48:06,766 --> 02:48:12,868
[SPEAKER_19]: It's a fan-made trailer for a movie that doesn't exist.

1951
02:48:14,309 --> 02:48:14,649
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't know.

1952
02:48:16,150 --> 02:48:18,810
[SPEAKER_20]: Where do people get the time to do that, seriously?

1953
02:48:19,351 --> 02:48:24,212
[SPEAKER_20]: I mean, I guess, then again, this is coming from a guy who co-hosts a three-hour internet show dedicated to video games.

1954
02:48:24,973 --> 02:48:28,894
[SPEAKER_19]: Well, this guy's actually trying to get himself, you know, work.

1955
02:48:29,614 --> 02:48:32,395
[SPEAKER_19]: It's a director that does the stuff, and he's done the same ones.

1956
02:48:32,415 --> 02:48:34,856
[SPEAKER_19]: He did another one called Batman Dead End, which was...

1957
02:48:36,027 --> 02:48:37,888
[SPEAKER_19]: Batman vs. Alien vs. Predator.

1958
02:48:38,268 --> 02:48:38,928
[SPEAKER_19]: It's a little short.

1959
02:48:39,028 --> 02:48:40,309
[SPEAKER_19]: It was really well done.

1960
02:48:40,649 --> 02:48:46,291
[SPEAKER_20]: That was the one that was really cool in the beginning, and then when it was Predator-fied, I was like, this is gay.

1961
02:48:48,132 --> 02:48:52,434
[SPEAKER_19]: They did another one called Grayson, too, which is supposed to be like Robin stuff.

1962
02:48:52,554 --> 02:48:53,354
[SPEAKER_19]: It looks cool.

1963
02:48:53,534 --> 02:48:55,275
[SPEAKER_19]: I mean, they have pretty cool people.

1964
02:48:56,956 --> 02:48:58,396
[SPEAKER_19]: It's better than your average fan film.

1965
02:48:58,436 --> 02:48:59,077
[SPEAKER_19]: Let's just put that one.

1966
02:48:59,537 --> 02:48:59,997
[SPEAKER_19]: But anyways, yeah.

1967
02:49:02,717 --> 02:49:03,277
[SPEAKER_20]: Interesting.

1968
02:49:03,397 --> 02:49:04,358
[SPEAKER_20]: Where can you download that?

1969
02:49:04,838 --> 02:49:06,359
[SPEAKER_20]: Is that like an Ain't It Cool News thing?

1970
02:49:07,159 --> 02:49:10,601
[SPEAKER_19]: I believe TheForce.net has links to these.

1971
02:49:10,821 --> 02:49:14,983
[SPEAKER_19]: They have like a fan film link for like other stuff.

1972
02:49:15,183 --> 02:49:24,427
[SPEAKER_19]: You can also get some weird Matrix ones too, but like another one that's pretty cool is Matrix Run Program, I think is the name of that one.

1973
02:49:24,847 --> 02:49:26,248
[SPEAKER_19]: That was pretty well done too.

1974
02:49:28,464 --> 02:49:37,910
[SPEAKER_20]: So this director's trying to find work, so what he does is he wastes tons of money making these fake-ass trailers for movies so that internet nerds can get big boners over them.

1975
02:49:37,970 --> 02:49:38,490
[SPEAKER_20]: Is that correct?

1976
02:49:38,830 --> 02:49:39,591
[SPEAKER_20]: Except explicit.

1977
02:49:40,912 --> 02:49:41,532
[SPEAKER_19]: Exactly.

1978
02:49:43,673 --> 02:49:43,993
[SPEAKER_20]: Alright.

1979
02:49:45,374 --> 02:49:45,875
[SPEAKER_20]: Interesting.

1980
02:49:46,335 --> 02:49:51,238
[SPEAKER_20]: Alright, we're going to take a quick break, and then when we come back, we're going to wrap things up.

1981
02:49:51,818 --> 02:49:53,879
[SPEAKER_20]: And please keep your boners secured at all times.

1982
02:49:54,300 --> 02:49:54,460
[SPEAKER_20]: Yep.

1983
02:49:54,780 --> 02:49:57,542
[SPEAKER_20]: And then there might be a few other surprises when we come back from break.

1984
02:49:57,562 --> 02:49:57,802
[SPEAKER_20]: We'll see.

1985
02:49:59,363 --> 02:49:59,923
[SPEAKER_20]: But no boners.

1986
02:50:00,364 --> 02:50:01,625
[SPEAKER_20]: So, yes, Loki.

1987
02:50:02,246 --> 02:50:08,232
[SPEAKER_19]: I mean, these would, I mean, obviously they're not theatrical quality, but I could definitely see this being like a TV movie or something.

1988
02:50:08,252 --> 02:50:10,634
[SPEAKER_19]: They really should let this guy make movies.

1989
02:50:11,215 --> 02:50:12,617
[SPEAKER_19]: Because I think they'd be pretty decent.

1990
02:50:12,797 --> 02:50:15,460
[SPEAKER_19]: I mean, they'd be better than like, you know, Lois and Clark and stuff.

1991
02:50:16,761 --> 02:50:18,583
[SPEAKER_20]: I don't think they should let this guy ever make a movie.

1992
02:50:20,391 --> 02:50:26,215
[SPEAKER_19]: They let the guy that made, what was it, Uwe Boll or whatever his name is Okay, they let him make movies, why not this guy?

1993
02:50:26,515 --> 02:50:46,669
[SPEAKER_20]: Because I would rather Uwe Boll make movies than this guy Because if this guy actually gets a deal and actually gets to make a movie Every freaking person on the internet will be turning out crap trying to imitate this So sorry dude, but I hope it doesn't work No comments to that, Loki?

1994
02:50:47,779 --> 02:50:49,802
[SPEAKER_19]: That was completely and utterly retarded.

1995
02:50:50,444 --> 02:50:51,025
[SPEAKER_19]: Your idea.

1996
02:50:51,145 --> 02:50:51,666
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm sorry.

1997
02:50:53,208 --> 02:50:53,789
[SPEAKER_20]: Ah, suck it.

1998
02:50:53,869 --> 02:50:55,031
[SPEAKER_20]: Alright, we're going to go to a break.

1999
02:50:55,813 --> 02:50:56,313
[SPEAKER_20]: We'll be back.

2000
02:50:56,654 --> 02:50:59,459
[SPEAKER_20]: I thought we could do some disco tunes in this break, so we'll be back after this.

2001
02:51:59,106 --> 02:51:59,502
[SPEAKER_14]: Thanks for watching!

2002
02:52:36,738 --> 02:52:43,101
I am gonna stand my ground, nothing in the world's gonna bring me down.

2003
02:52:43,361 --> 02:52:50,765
Hear me yell and hear me roar, I am something that you can't ignore.

2004
02:52:51,185 --> 02:52:59,089
I am here for all of us, I am this and we're all that we want.

2005
02:53:02,289 --> 02:53:03,550

02:54:10,295 --> 02:54:12,657
[SPEAKER_20]: We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio.

2010
02:54:14,218 --> 02:54:15,299
[SPEAKER_20]: About to wrap stuff up.

2011
02:54:15,900 --> 02:54:24,086
[SPEAKER_20]: But you know, when we get towards the end of the show and we're running out of things to talk about, we always turn to the DDR community to find us some inspiration.

2012
02:54:24,526 --> 02:54:28,910
[SPEAKER_20]: And of course, we like to head on over to the biggest DDR site out there,

2013
02:54:29,454 --> 02:54:36,716
[SPEAKER_20]: TheDDRFreak.com And we like to find ourselves the DDR Freak Post of the Week.

2014
02:54:36,796 --> 02:54:39,237
[SPEAKER_20]: So we're going to look at our DDR Chit Chat Post of the Week.

2015
02:54:45,799 --> 02:54:47,319
[SPEAKER_20]: It was actually Slim Pickens this week.

2016
02:54:47,360 --> 02:54:50,040
[SPEAKER_20]: There was really not a whole lot of newbie posts.

2017
02:54:50,100 --> 02:54:52,681
[SPEAKER_20]: I mean, there was some, but nothing that hilarious.

2018
02:54:52,721 --> 02:54:54,982
[SPEAKER_20]: So this was hard for me to make a determination.

2019
02:54:55,002 --> 02:54:56,922
[SPEAKER_20]: But I did decide on this post here.

2020
02:54:57,743 --> 02:54:58,503
[SPEAKER_20]: This is a post...

2021
02:54:59,315 --> 02:55:05,658
[SPEAKER_20]: and it's called American Songs Are Wrecking DDR.

2022
02:55:06,238 --> 02:55:07,059
[SPEAKER_20]: And the post goes like this.

2023
02:55:07,759 --> 02:55:13,122
[SPEAKER_20]: Whose idea was it to put songs made by Cher and Madonna in DDR?

2024
02:55:13,722 --> 02:55:16,443
[SPEAKER_20]: Unless you're a housewife, these songs gotta go.

2025
02:55:17,744 --> 02:55:22,326
[SPEAKER_20]: They didn't put Max Period in Extreme US and I didn't think they were making DDR anymore.

2026
02:55:23,038 --> 02:55:23,799
[SPEAKER_20]: I got a question.

2027
02:55:43,669 --> 02:55:46,691
[SPEAKER_26]: Doesn't really matter if a song is like 300 beats p.m.

2028
02:55:46,751 --> 02:55:47,172
[SPEAKER_26]: or more.

2029
02:55:47,192 --> 02:55:55,578
[SPEAKER_26]: Because honestly, everyone who complains about this wants a Max song in it or Paranoia Survivor, Paranoia Survivor Max into any of the U.S.

2030
02:55:55,598 --> 02:55:56,199
[SPEAKER_26]: releases.

2031
02:55:56,939 --> 02:56:03,724
[SPEAKER_26]: Of course, everyone knows there's no Paranoia Survivor or Survivor Max in like Vulture Mix or the New York Stream series.

2032
02:56:04,024 --> 02:56:08,668
[SPEAKER_19]: Hell, Paranoia Survivor and Survivor Max are just sped up versions of the other song.

2033
02:56:09,208 --> 02:56:09,649
[SPEAKER_19]: Woo!

2034
02:56:09,749 --> 02:56:11,050
[SPEAKER_19]: Paranoia Survivor and woo!

2035
02:56:11,090 --> 02:56:12,391
[SPEAKER_19]: Paranoia Survivor Max!

2036
02:56:13,180 --> 02:56:15,221
[SPEAKER_19]: which is a sped up version of the song.

2037
02:56:16,401 --> 02:56:17,961
[SPEAKER_19]: Wow, that took a lot of work there.

2038
02:56:18,981 --> 02:56:19,902
[SPEAKER_19]: See, that's what's sad.

2039
02:56:20,322 --> 02:56:26,883
[SPEAKER_19]: People, you know, they probably look at these people playing SimFiles and they're like, hey, they like Max 600, it's just sped up Max 300.

2040
02:56:27,864 --> 02:56:29,404
[SPEAKER_19]: Let's do that with Paranoia Survivor.

2041
02:56:29,424 --> 02:56:31,105
[SPEAKER_19]: We have two songs for the price of one.

2042
02:56:32,505 --> 02:56:33,125
[SPEAKER_20]: Exactly.

2043
02:56:34,325 --> 02:56:40,947
[SPEAKER_20]: I don't know about you guys, but I think DDR is all about fun and trying to play Sakura heavy on a homepad is not fun.

2044
02:56:42,253 --> 02:57:02,852
[SPEAKER_26]: Dancing around to Cher and Madonna, fun I mean, I don't mind about the song list, but some people just have to get a grip that a mix is not going to have all ten footers Rob, that's just the gay in you, saying that Hey, I like a lot of songs in DDR, not just the gay ones

2045
02:57:06,700 --> 02:57:07,620
[SPEAKER_20]: Angel, your thoughts.

2046
02:57:07,641 --> 02:57:09,082
[SPEAKER_20]: Do you have any thoughts on this one?

2047
02:57:09,522 --> 02:57:09,682
[SPEAKER_20]: No?

2048
02:57:09,762 --> 02:57:10,343
[SPEAKER_20]: She's shaking her head.

2049
02:57:11,304 --> 02:57:11,584
[SPEAKER_20]: Okay.

2050
02:57:12,685 --> 02:57:13,926
[SPEAKER_20]: Instead, she's giving me candy.

2051
02:57:13,966 --> 02:57:14,947
[SPEAKER_20]: Ooh, that's a very good thing.

2052
02:57:15,007 --> 02:57:15,607
[SPEAKER_20]: I like candy.

2053
02:57:15,868 --> 02:57:17,129
[SPEAKER_20]: Candy's a good way to make me happy.

2054
02:57:17,409 --> 02:57:19,230
[SPEAKER_20]: These little, like, they look like Pringles, but they're not.

2055
02:57:19,251 --> 02:57:20,311
[SPEAKER_20]: They're little chocolate chip things.

2056
02:57:20,772 --> 02:57:21,152
[SPEAKER_20]: Swoops?

2057
02:57:21,232 --> 02:57:21,813
[SPEAKER_20]: Is that what they're called?

2058
02:57:22,413 --> 02:57:23,935
[SPEAKER_26]: Yeah, I mean, yeah.

2059
02:57:24,135 --> 02:57:33,323
[SPEAKER_26]: Like, related to my question, like, would anybody buy a mix that had 70 paranoias and 10 maxes all in just one package?

2060
02:57:33,443 --> 02:57:33,663
[SPEAKER_26]: Yeah.

2061
02:57:35,563 --> 02:57:36,343
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes, I might.

2062
02:57:37,744 --> 02:57:44,025
[SPEAKER_20]: Because honestly... Seriously, why don't we release a home mix?

2063
02:57:44,085 --> 02:57:45,325
[SPEAKER_20]: These are the songs we'll put in it.

2064
02:57:45,345 --> 02:57:51,707
[SPEAKER_20]: We'll put Max Period, Paranoia Survivor Max, the Max 300 mix from Ultramix 2.

2065
02:57:52,127 --> 02:57:52,507
[SPEAKER_20]: You know what?

2066
02:57:52,547 --> 02:57:52,927
[SPEAKER_20]: Fuck it.

2067
02:57:52,967 --> 02:57:58,528
[SPEAKER_20]: We'll just license a whole bunch of Nine Inch Nails and Crystal Method and all these really fast groups that do fast songs.

2068
02:57:58,548 --> 02:58:02,109
[SPEAKER_20]: We'll license all their tracks and we'll put it in a home mix and we'll call...

2069
02:58:02,987 --> 02:58:06,370
[SPEAKER_20]: Good fucking luck, Mix, playing this on your fucking homepad.

2070
02:58:07,871 --> 02:58:14,557
[SPEAKER_26]: Or they could just do, infuse the song like everybody, does it be my style, Max Dinosaur or 1, 2, 3, 4, Max 300.

2071
02:58:14,877 --> 02:58:20,241
[SPEAKER_20]: And then we'll call it, I hope you own a fucking Cobalt Flux, Mix.

2072
02:58:20,481 --> 02:58:23,084
[SPEAKER_20]: Seriously, because that's the only way you're going to pass any of this shit.

2073
02:58:24,365 --> 02:58:25,846
[SPEAKER_20]: Or DDR Controller, Mix.

2074
02:58:26,767 --> 02:58:28,068
[SPEAKER_20]: Button, Button Revolution.

2075
02:58:28,328 --> 02:58:29,289
[SPEAKER_26]: Rape, Rape Revolution.

2076
02:58:30,189 --> 02:58:30,850
[SPEAKER_26]: How rapey that is.

2077
02:58:31,235 --> 02:58:32,916
[SPEAKER_20]: or America's Beatmania.

2078
02:58:36,278 --> 02:58:37,639
[SPEAKER_20]: There you go.

2079
02:58:38,240 --> 02:58:41,382
[SPEAKER_20]: You guys that wanted a Beatmania USA, there you go.

2080
02:58:41,422 --> 02:58:45,344
[SPEAKER_20]: They're just going to release a DDR mix and have nothing but 10s and 11s in it.

2081
02:58:45,484 --> 02:58:47,025
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah, they'll have 11-footers in it now.

2082
02:58:47,265 --> 02:58:48,946
[SPEAKER_20]: And they'll call it Beatmania USA.

2083
02:58:49,387 --> 02:58:49,807
[SPEAKER_20]: There it is.

2084
02:58:50,868 --> 02:58:51,568
[SPEAKER_26]: Problem solved.

2085
02:58:53,329 --> 02:58:53,709
[SPEAKER_26]: In a way.

2086
02:58:57,068 --> 02:59:01,352
[SPEAKER_20]: Anyway, I think that's going to do it for tonight's episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

2087
02:59:02,132 --> 02:59:05,275
[SPEAKER_20]: So now we're going to go around and get everybody's final thought.

2088
02:59:06,415 --> 02:59:07,856
[SPEAKER_20]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

2089
02:59:28,969 --> 02:59:32,712
[SPEAKER_20]: and I would urge you to read through the instructions on our website.

2090
02:59:32,732 --> 02:59:38,856
[SPEAKER_20]: If that's one of you, if you mark that answer, read through the instructions on our website under the Orange Lounge Radio To Go edition page.

2091
02:59:38,956 --> 02:59:39,816
[SPEAKER_20]: It's really easy.

2092
02:59:40,236 --> 02:59:44,879
[SPEAKER_20]: All you got to do is download a program called iPotter and you can get this at what?

2093
02:59:44,960 --> 02:59:50,483
[SPEAKER_20]: It's just iPotter.sourceforge.net or even just put it into like Google, do a search for it.

2094
02:59:50,823 --> 02:59:56,307
[SPEAKER_20]: It's really easy to find and then it gives you like a window in there where you put in a URL just like a web browser.

2095
02:59:56,667 --> 02:59:57,568
[SPEAKER_20]: Put in our URL.

2096
02:59:57,668 --> 02:59:58,849
[SPEAKER_20]: It is super, super easy.

2097
02:59:58,989 --> 03:00:04,593
[SPEAKER_20]: Again, you do not need an iPod or any type of portable MP3 device to listen to the show.

2098
03:00:04,653 --> 03:00:09,516
[SPEAKER_20]: They only call it a podcast because it sounds cute and iPods happen to be popular.

2099
03:00:09,896 --> 03:00:10,997
[SPEAKER_20]: You don't need one.

2100
03:00:11,337 --> 03:00:11,637
[SPEAKER_20]: Loki.

2101
03:00:12,278 --> 03:00:17,281
[SPEAKER_19]: I did find one of the songs that could be on that, you know, good fucking luck mix.

2102
03:00:18,582 --> 03:00:19,583
[SPEAKER_19]: Berserker, Reality.

2103
03:00:24,166 --> 03:00:25,067
[SPEAKER_19]: What the fuck?

2104
03:00:26,019 --> 03:00:31,202
[SPEAKER_19]: And sadly enough, that is the same file that you've found on BomaniStyle.com.

2105
03:00:31,262 --> 03:00:34,224
[SPEAKER_26]: I've seen a lot of realities, I just don't download them.

2106
03:00:34,324 --> 03:00:36,566
[SPEAKER_20]: You know what, and we'll just let DM Ashura do all the music.

2107
03:00:40,148 --> 03:00:48,433
[SPEAKER_20]: And then, you know what, DM Ashura will do all the music, and then, who's that kid that does all the crazy-ass Oni steps?

2108
03:00:48,593 --> 03:00:48,754
[SPEAKER_20]: He's

2109
03:00:49,892 --> 03:00:50,292
[SPEAKER_20]: NakedHotTubbing

2110
03:01:20,310 --> 03:01:21,491
[SPEAKER_20]: Explicit, your final thought.

2111
03:01:21,972 --> 03:01:25,655
[SPEAKER_26]: I survived the anti-boner Lent so far.

2112
03:01:26,156 --> 03:01:26,576
[SPEAKER_20]: So far.

2113
03:01:26,596 --> 03:01:29,199
[SPEAKER_26]: So don't send me any more porn or anything like that.

2114
03:01:29,379 --> 03:01:30,420
[SPEAKER_20]: And what is your email address?

2115
03:01:31,141 --> 03:01:31,321
[SPEAKER_20]: Huh?

2116
03:01:32,001 --> 03:01:32,822
[SPEAKER_20]: What is your email address?

2117
03:01:33,483 --> 03:01:38,588
[SPEAKER_26]: Explicitalpha at yahoo.com Just look up his profile on DDR3.

2118
03:01:39,128 --> 03:01:39,989
[SPEAKER_20]: Angel, your final thought.

2119
03:01:40,830 --> 03:01:44,273
[SPEAKER_30]: Need more time in a week to play Final Fantasy XI.

2120
03:01:44,293 --> 03:01:44,533
[SPEAKER_30]: Yeah.

2121
03:01:44,854 --> 03:01:45,014
[SPEAKER_30]: Yeah.

2122
03:01:46,894 --> 03:01:50,997
[SPEAKER_20]: My final thought is... I don't want to go back to work tomorrow.

2123
03:01:51,057 --> 03:01:55,220
[SPEAKER_20]: And tomorrow's Valentine's Day and it's going to suck because everybody's going to have flowers and shit.

2124
03:01:55,260 --> 03:01:56,281
[SPEAKER_20]: And I don't have that stuff.

2125
03:01:56,942 --> 03:01:57,742
[SPEAKER_20]: Loki, your final thought.

2126
03:01:59,804 --> 03:02:01,585
[SPEAKER_19]: I know I'm clicking and I don't care.

2127
03:02:03,767 --> 03:02:09,651
[SPEAKER_19]: No, my final thought is... I don't want to have to return this fucking battery.

2128
03:02:10,492 --> 03:02:11,152
[SPEAKER_19]: Sucks.

2129
03:02:11,773 --> 03:02:11,152
$200.

2130
03:02:14,815 --> 03:02:16,236
[SPEAKER_20]: And the final word of the show...

2131
03:02:16,823 --> 03:02:18,704
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm going to give the final word of the show to Loki.

2132
03:02:18,944 --> 03:02:20,665
[SPEAKER_20]: Loki, one word to sum it all up tonight.

2133
03:02:23,686 --> 03:02:24,147
[SPEAKER_08]: Bacon!

2134
03:02:25,667 --> 03:02:30,530
[SPEAKER_08]: That does it for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio Live.

2135
03:02:31,350 --> 03:02:35,572
[SPEAKER_08]: Orange Lounge Radio Live is an Orange Lounge Radio production.

2136
03:02:36,072 --> 03:02:43,456

2137
03:02:44,375 --> 03:02:48,357
[SPEAKER_08]: And now, here is your fortune cookie message of the day.

2138
03:02:51,698 --> 03:02:54,419
[SPEAKER_00]: And now, today's Ebonics language lesson.

2139
03:02:55,200 --> 03:02:55,940
[SPEAKER_00]: Meeting girls.

2140
03:02:56,720 --> 03:02:58,621
[SPEAKER_00]: My, you're a lovely young lady.

2141
03:02:59,341 --> 03:03:01,002
[SPEAKER_23]: Damn, you's a fine mother******.

2142
03:03:01,982 --> 03:03:04,023
[SPEAKER_00]: Damn, you's a fine mother******.

2143
03:03:05,424 --> 03:03:07,045
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's go for a ride, shall we?

2144
03:03:07,665 --> 03:03:10,426
[SPEAKER_23]: Hey baby, jump in my little ride and let's rotate these ties.

2145
03:03:11,112 --> 03:03:15,094
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, baby, let's jump in my lowrider and let's rotate these tires.

2146
03:03:16,155 --> 03:03:17,055
[SPEAKER_00]: You are beautiful.

2147
03:03:17,515 --> 03:03:18,836
[SPEAKER_00]: I would like to make love to you.

2148
03:03:19,556 --> 03:03:21,517
[SPEAKER_23]: Damn, bitch, you stupid fly.

2149
03:03:21,978 --> 03:03:24,419
[SPEAKER_23]: Let me pull up to that bumper and smack that monkey.

2150
03:03:25,039 --> 03:03:26,960
[SPEAKER_00]: Damn, bitch, you stupid fly.

2151
03:03:27,340 --> 03:03:29,902
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me pull up to your bumper and smack that monkey.

2152
03:03:30,802 --> 03:03:31,883
[SPEAKER_00]: Greeting old friends.

2153
03:03:32,663 --> 03:03:33,263
