410	3932	Orange Lounge Radio To Go Edition, week of February 14th, 2005.
4453	15800	And now, the Orange Lounge Radio To Go Edition, your internet radio home for discussion on rhythm and music gaming, and all the news on video games that don't suck.
16220	20463	And now, here are your hosts, DarkSakura, Sky, and Loki.
21417	28418	Hello everybody once again, and thank you for subscribing to our podcast and downloading yet another episode.
28838	31299	Here we are, the week of Valentine's Day.
31819	34139	I hope you all are having a lovely Valentine's Day.
34239	34920	I know I'm not.
36300	38260	Because I'm single as hell, but that's alright.
38920	42661	DarkSakura is actually out tonight because she's spending the holiday with her fianc√©.
42961	44381	So we have some guests filling in tonight.
44441	45722	Say hello to DDR Angel.
46002	46322	Hello.
46662	48302	Hi DDR Angel, welcome to our podcast.
49468	50569	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
79159	83843	I put a PC, a Micro ITX PC, which is a form factor.
83923	87226	It's 15 centimeters by 15 centimeters is the size of the motherboard.
88127	91610	And it's inside of an Xbox that's painted orange.
92130	93331	Hence the orange box.
95253	98495	Now, if Bill Gates finds out about this, do you think you're going to be in any trouble?
98516	104240	The only trouble I'd be in is because I have a pirated version of Windows in it, but that's about it.
104861	107283	Oh, that and the movies that might be on the hard drive.
107955	110817	It's not RIA or MPA friendly.
111537	114019	You do know anyone can download this podcast, right?
115880	116820	Whatever, I don't care.
117601	118541	I'll put Linux on it.
118962	120382	Don't make me put Linux on it.
120582	121483	God damn it, I will.
121703	123064	Free BSD all the way.
125285	126366	And how's the monitor work?
126746	132309	You took like a little PS1 monitor that, you know, they don't really sell so many of those anymore because they don't sell the PS1 so much.
132590	134871	But you actually took one of those little portable 5-inch monitors.
135171	136612	How the hell are you able to see anything on this thing?
137951	141012	Very carefully enlarged all the fonts on it to very large.
141572	148913	And, you know, I also have, thank God for Windows and having that, you know, feature the magnifier for those people that can't see shit.
149933	157434	You load that up there and anything that you, you know, move over with your mouse, it will enlarge in this little window for you.
157514	158995	So I've used that a lot.
160895	166456	But to be honest, actually you can see quite a bit on that monitor because it's such a high resolution monitor.
167165	168586	Small text is the only problem.
169347	174172	I notice it's very crisp, so if you do plan to use it for movies or games or something, it's going to be very crisp.
174392	177295	Kind of hard to see, but interesting.
177975	185382	Alright, I thought we'd go around, and before we get into this week's gaming news, since we do have some guests on the panel tonight, I thought we could talk about what kind of games you've been playing this week.
185422	186563	What kind of stuff have you been into?
186904	187124	Angel?
188705	192189	The MXO beta test, which was...
192765	193445	Yeah, whatever.
193585	196746	And for those not in the know, in the acronym know, that was Matrix Online, right?
196766	197467	Yeah, Matrix Online.
200067	201188	Whatever, I'll give it another week.
201468	205749	Do you think it's... I noticed that people are selling... Because you had to have a code to get into the Matrix Online beta test, right?
206029	208250	I noticed people are selling those codes on eBay.
208810	210571	My first question is, A, is that legal?
210611	211031	Probably not.
211071	211971	But B, is it worth it?
211991	213452	I don't know.
213512	215372	You can get it at five bucks for fries.
215772	216993	I mean, at fries.
217313	217593	Okay.
218253	219554	Go to fries and get it for five bucks.
220154	220454	That's what I...
221433	225476	And you're doing like a pre-order then, and then you get to play the game on beta test as well.
225796	226196	That's cool.
226477	228158	Now, Loki, you've been playing this too, right?
228938	229418	A little bit.
229939	230939	I'm only level two.
231440	236003	And I played it maybe about an hour, an hour at the most on this.
236803	237504	It looks pretty.
238604	244308	It's a little difficult to get into it because it's just like they kind of,
245703	246283	and so on.
270709	273090	Alright, what else have you been playing this week, Angel?
294398	300903	Actually, I watched someone play World of Warcraft, so I'm kind of getting a... I don't know.
300963	308628	I kind of want it, but I kind of don't because I don't want to be whooping on Final Fantasy XI too much because I do like that one a lot more.
308648	310169	I know.
310270	310670	It's tough.
310950	315473	As much as I love Final Fantasy XI, everybody is raving about World of Warcraft.
315513	320097	And the time I saw it, I was kind of like... Because I watched somebody play it too, and I was kind of like, eh.
320637	323099	But I kind of feel like I owe it to myself now with everybody just...
323908	324568	Thank you for watching!
343275	343795	That's what you like.
343975	349438	With our copy of World of Warcraft, we actually got a 10-day trial thing.
349458	352520	You could actually give the code to somebody else and try it for 10 days.
353680	354381	It's open to me.
354461	357202	I can do it, but I don't know.
357222	357602	We'll see.
357922	358403	Interesting.
358443	362725	If you do end up doing it, I want your 10-day card that you get because I want to check it out a little more in depth.
362805	364346	Oh, you mean if I buy my own copy?
364366	364706	Yeah, yeah.
364926	365146	Oh, yeah.
365186	365586	No problem.
365806	365986	Cool.
368226	371348	I've also been playing a lot of there this week now for those that don't know.
372368	374289	It's like TSO but better.
375610	377671	Whoa, you're playing the acronyms game again.
377711	378452	The Sims Online.
378692	382034	That's right.
383034	386156	It's chat about TSO and MXO on OLR.
387517	387757	See?
387977	388777	There you go.
388837	389398	Acronym game.
391059	396962	For those that want more information on their Open Up Your Internet Explorer I mean Explorer
397575	399056	or Firefox if you're smarter.
399196	402038	Actually, you can't because it's picky about that.
402098	403278	It won't let you do it.
403419	403659	What?
404119	404419	I know.
404499	404839	Sucks.
405040	405320	Lame.
405480	405920	Whatever.
406100	406680	Don't want to play it.
408642	410143	It's like an XML thing or something.
410503	415526	Anyway, yeah, so just go to there.com and find out for yourself if you really like it or not.
415986	416326	Okay.
416947	417267	Fair enough.
417287	419988	So it's kind of like The Sims Online but without all the prostitution.
421009	421249	Okay.
422150	422610	Whatever.
423190	424151	What's so fun in that?
425117	428179	Seriously, that's the only reason why I play The Sims Online.
428920	430821	That's what I heard The Sims Online turned into.
431002	434124	It was like Vegas, and I don't know if this is true, but I was reading articles on this.
434764	439848	Sims Online turned into this big gambling, crack-dealing site.
440869	441309	Crazy.
441950	447934	I just know that The Sims Online was not quite as popular as I think they'd hoped it would be, considering the popularity of The Sims.
448695	450536	I also got to see Minish Cap this week.
450556	451197	That was pretty cool.
452944	455045	By the way, speaking of The Sims, I want to get this out real quick.
455405	458166	The Sims celebrated its fifth anniversary this week.
458466	466949	And get this, The Sims has shipped, since its release, 52 million units and been translated into 17 different languages.
467289	471891	The series of games has been a top seller for four of the past five years.
472471	473152	Crazy, huh?
473392	474612	Wow, yay for that.
476373	479114	The first time I played The Sims, I had to kill people.
481095	482195	I don't know about the rest of you.
482998	484459	I know this is true with you, Loki.
484479	489401	When you did your review of The Sims 2, you were like, how many interesting ways could I kill people in this game?
490562	494103	Exactly, and I have to really go back to that and find some more ways to do that.
494523	498465	Because my elaborate death house didn't turn out as fun as I thought it would be.
499846	501487	Ended up with piles of stuff.
502187	504748	No, people just didn't want to die that quickly.
506529	510711	Because I was putting in the cheat codes where you can move any object around.
511232	516094	So I was picking up people that were walking by the house and throwing them up into a room that was enclosed.
518635	520756	They didn't like that too much and they were panicking.
520816	521257	It was fun.
522137	525759	I was trying my best to catch a guy on fire but that really didn't happen.
528060	535383	I remember how you put the giant diving board on the roof and you were going to wait for somebody to dive and then you were going to take away the pool while they were in the midair.
535983	539965	But nobody would ever jump off the board because they were all so sad.
541636	543717	They also didn't want to jump to their death.
544017	549758	I thought that would be, you know, a way to do it, but no one wanted to commit suicide.
549798	556400	They really need to, like, release a patch where, you know, it's less, you know, friendly, you know, just kind of let people die.
557560	560621	Of course, I have the nude patch, so people will be walking around naked all the time, too.
561361	562582	The Sims Morbid Edition.
562742	563602	Only on the internet.
563722	564802	Anything else you've been playing, Angel?
565963	567803	Uh, not that I can think of at the moment.
567983	568703	Alright, fair enough.
568783	570024	Bud, what have you been playing this week?
570264	570824	Maps.google.com
573092	574513	Now, that is a very cool site.
574993	575693	I checked this out.
576133	577654	Very cool.
578274	582955	Sometimes it's fun to just play with those Atlas programs and like, oh, here's my house and here's, you know.
585176	591798	Now, what they don't have, which I think is really cool, and I think MapQuest has this, but it has like the satellite view version.
591858	592979	Or does Google have that now?
593499	593819	I don't know.
594800	595820	They have something similar.
596220	599501	There was actually an article on Hackaday.com.
599761	601962	They had a website that had both
602651	619583	Google's map feature and this other map feature where you can actually plug in I don't know, it was like coordinates actually and you can view the Google map and then also the actual satellite picture.
619603	620604	That was the London one, right?
622045	624807	I don't remember, but anyways.
625708	626929	Alright, he's going to look that one up.
626969	629030	So you've been playing with that though?
629370	629911	Oh, yes.
629931	629991	Yes.
631957	633959	Yet again, another Linux.
635080	637482	They stuck Linux in a Billy Bass.
638343	641105	What is a Billy Bass?
641145	642006	The singing fish.
642186	643647	The singing fish things.
645129	646630	Why, people, why?
647030	650393	A follow-up to last week when we were talking about they won't install Linux in anything.
650493	652575	There you go, they've installed Linux in a Billy Bass.
654036	655237	My pants are still Linux-free.
656318	656719	For now.
658101	660964	Anything else you've been playing with other than the maps game?
661044	663327	I've been playing the real world game of employment.
665369	667251	I haven't had time to play a damn game this week.
667491	669433	Alright, well you're a lot of fun to have on this show then.
669513	670133	Yeah.
670334	670694	It's alright.
670834	671715	I didn't even make it to Halo 2.
673117	675739	I watched my Mac sleep all week.
675819	678963	I haven't played Halo in a long time.
679023	679643	It's kind of sad.
679663	680364	I don't know.
680911	693860	Anyway, what I've been playing this week, I've been playing... I actually decided... Well, I played Mr. Driller a little more, because Angel let me borrow Mr. Driller, and I actually... Remember how last week I said I needed to get good at the game and figure out the strategies?
694560	695841	I think I'm getting okay.
696241	701845	I'm finally learning how to get some of those tricky air capsules without having to dig straight down all the time, and I'm getting the concept.
702265	704467	All it took was a little time, and I figured it out.
705608	705908	Also...
707438	714642	I decided to go a little retro this week because you might remember that DarkSakura, she brought with her to the three hour show last week.
714662	720665	She brought Dracula X, but the Japanese version on the Turbo Duo.
720925	722246	And we were watching little clips from that.
722526	726888	Well, I remember somebody said that there was a Super Nintendo version of that game that came out and I played it.
727822	732824	and it's awful compared to the one that she brought last week on the TurboDuo.
732864	739526	It is just dreadful and I remember I had played that game a long time ago when it first came out and I was like, what happened to the Castlevania games?
739546	740546	They used to be so cool.
741087	747689	So I decided instead to go back and play Super Castlevania 4 because that game is awesome and it's a great Castlevania game.
747789	749870	So I was feeling a little retro this week.
750910	751550	You had a common angel?
751570	754051	I was going to say, I didn't even know you had a Super Nintendo.
755031	755632	Oh yes, he did.
755972	756532	I have one.
757026	757666	on my PC.
759147	763648	Get it?
764629	766289	Loki, what kind of games have you been playing this week?
768330	771892	I played Matrix Online and Final Fantasy XI.
772132	777053	I haven't even gotten back to Grand Theft Auto San Andreas yet.
778874	780235	I really need to go back to that.
781435	781975	It'll be fun.
783776	786657	No other game I'm going to be playing soon, which comes out tomorrow.
788140	789781	Yep, WarioWare Touched.
790881	791901	That's going to be the next game.
792961	797723	I'm very excited about WarioWare Touched, and I think it's great that they're releasing it on Valentine's Day.
797783	800544	For those that are downloading the podcast throughout the week, he's talking about Valentine's Day.
800864	801744	Now, does it ship?
802084	803845	This is one thing that always confuses the hell out of me.
804245	807306	Is it shipping tomorrow, or is it shelving tomorrow?
807366	811307	Because you know that they have a ship day, and then usually the shelf date is one or two days afterwards.
811707	813208	Is it shipping or shelving tomorrow?
813588	814288	That's what I want to know.
816936	817577	Well, I don't know.
817818	823612	I have only been going by IGN's site, which has the release date for tomorrow.
824093	825176	So, whatever that means.
826960	832064	Probably the ship, so I'm not going to go to the store until Tuesday, but I'm very excited nonetheless to be playing this game.
832204	832684	I'm very excited.
832704	835567	We'll bring you a full review of that next week, because you know we're all going to be playing that.
835747	837868	You like the WarioWare games too, right Angel?
837988	838649	Yes, I do.
840911	844654	There might be a GameStop trip in the near future.
844974	846735	Is it supposed to have multiplayer in this one?
846895	847416	I don't remember.
848550	849210	I don't remember either.
849250	858552	I hope they took some of the good ideas from the GameCube one, because the GameCube WarioWare was like, eh, you know, because it was basically the same darn game, but it had such a cool, like, multiplayer edition.
858572	859812	But multiplayer is so much fun!
859932	860973	It is so much fun!
861973	862493	Only one player.
863153	863453	Don't!
863553	863933	Don't!
865033	870935	Classic Nintendo, they'll do the multiplayer in the next release, and it'll be the same damn game, but multiplayer.
871395	872235	Oh well, gotta love them.
873277	875118	Alright, let's talk about some news this week.
875138	877839	We'll actually start it off with Nintendo.
877879	880341	I have quite a little bit of Nintendo news to talk about right now.
882182	882902	This is interesting.
883162	888425	EBGames.com is listing a Metroid pinball game for the DS.
889986	890706	Very interesting.
890826	894468	I don't know, they're listing it on their game as tentative December 5th.
895129	901512	Nintendo of America will not comment on this, but if you think about it, in the game, in Metroid the game...
902245	904347	Samus does condense into the little ball.
904388	906790	It's one of the first things she gets, so I don't know.
907070	908772	This would be kind of a fit.
910034	913337	Why did that suddenly bring me back to, like, Sonic Spinball?
913518	915380	That's the first thing I thought of, too, was Sonic Spinball.
915720	919264	Because it had, like, that same look in the sewer stage in the beginning.
919284	919644	I don't know.
920445	921166	Same thing.
921827	922287	Same thing.
922468	923629	Sonic Spinball and Pokemon.
924648	930869	I guess the Pokemon pinball games do pretty well, so why not, since we haven't had a new Pokemon game in a while, why not go into another series?
931649	933690	Mario had a pinball game as well.
934090	934290	What?
934810	937271	Yeah, Mario had a pinball game not too long ago on the Advance.
938191	938431	Loki.
939791	940231	I don't know.
940451	942071	Why with the pinball games?
942212	944412	I mean, why?
944972	947092	I guess it would work, though, with the two shoulder buttons.
947112	947733	That'd be kind of neat.
947833	948493	The screen's tall.
950919	979675	yeah I don't know I could see it as more as like a little mini game that they might include with like you know the Metroid Prime Hunters or something like that interesting to see coming out soon or actually I should say just was released not too long ago Judge Dread Dread vs. Death why are they releasing Judge Dread games honestly I am the law couldn't tell you that one um
980385	987469	Also in the news about Nintendo, this story is coming out of the Japanese Trademark and Patent Office, or at least that's the place that inspired this story.
987829	993332	Nintendo has registered a couple trademarks recently, one of them being the Nintendo V-Pocket.
994393	1002917	Now, you don't know what that means, but it also has a little logo that goes with it, and the rumor is saying that maybe it's some type of DS adapter.
1003398	1003878	Who knows?
1004278	1008520	Could it be that rumored MPEG-4 and MP3 adapter?
1009121	1009601	Don't know.
1010319	1010699	Who knows?
1011740	1012080	It is.
1012640	1013560	It is the adapter.
1013601	1014241	V Pocket.
1014301	1015101	Video Pocket.
1015141	1015481	Hello.
1015561	1015962	Come on.
1016502	1018183	It doesn't take a genius to figure this one out.
1018363	1019443	I mean, that's what it is.
1020224	1020864	That's what it's going to be.
1020884	1024405	Because everyone loves and is eating up portable video.
1024926	1036911	And now that the PSP is going to have the UMD format, of course they're going to need to come up with their own format for, you know, to be used with the DS or to be used with, you know, the GBA.
1036971	1038372	So, of course, that's what it is.
1039477	1040618	Alright, we'll see if you're right.
1041358	1062870	Speaking of the games coming out for PSP, or I should say the movies, there's actually going to be some movies released on UMD format on April 19th here in America, and we're going to have films XXX, XXX, whatever you want to call it, you know that Vin Diesel movie, Hellboy, Resident Evil Apocalypse, and Once Upon a Time in Mexico.
1063170	1068693	They're going to be released on that UMD format specifically for your PSP so you can watch movies on the go.
1069927	1071067	Sound interesting to anybody?
1071868	1073128	Is this something you'd be interested in?
1074368	1074569	No.
1075529	1087813	It's interesting in perspective of me, because I work at a video distribution company, so it's yet another format that won't take off, just like the DVHS.
1088373	1090654	So, nice try.
1090734	1094295	We'll see how long it goes, but I don't think people are going to be buying other copies.
1094315	1098376	I know what's going to happen is they're going to find a way to just put this on a flash card for, you know,
1100113	1100573	It won't work.
1100593	1105074	Aren't the USPSPs coming with Spider-Man 2 and UMD?
1105194	1106535	This is one of the stories we talked about last week.
1106555	1109555	If you buy one of the first million units, you're going to get a copy of Spider-Man 2.
1110956	1116057	But as I mentioned last week, who doesn't own that movie already anyway?
1116857	1120018	I mean, anybody that had a remote interest in that movie probably has it already.
1120418	1120738	I don't know.
1121058	1121778	That's just my thought.
1122578	1126299	But another interesting thing about this format that I think is interesting is that
1127066	1137135	I don't really see this catching on too much because I think there's a very limited genre as to what can be released on the PSP.
1137295	1142539	I don't see them releasing Academy Award winning foreign films on UMD format.
1142960	1145742	I think it's going to be mostly these bang bang shoot-em-up films.
1146022	1149285	Although I believe they also opened the format.
1150313	1156057	The hardware to create the format is not readily available, and therefore it's probably not going to fly that well.
1156417	1164322	It's going to be like Minidisc, it's going to be an underground thing where there's going to be some people that have it, and a lot of people that don't even know what the fuck it is.
1165142	1169725	You know, and it seems to me that if you want to watch movies on the go, they already have portable DVD players.
1169745	1171186	They don't have a proprietary format.
1171406	1174069	How many formats do you want to buy your movies in?
1195953	1220619	DHS, DVD Here's where I think Nintendo actually might be more successful in this This is the interesting part, if they do decide to release their thing Because if you look at the Game Boy Advance movies that they have out right now Like the Spongebob and the Strawberry Shortcake and all that stuff they have out The reason why these are easy for kids is because they're great for car rides You give the kid the little game and they can sit and watch it
1221331	1224633	while they're on the road and on the road a long drive to somewhere.
1224933	1229996	But I can't imagine giving a kid a PSP and having them watch Hellboy in the backseat of the car, you know?
1231177	1239862	I think Nintendo and their bit of a family-friendly, quote-unquote, edge, although they took a lot of crap for that back in the day, I think that's going to help them out in this market.
1239922	1241723	But that's just my personal thought.
1242144	1248267	Unless the PSP decides to get competitive and release some of their own kid-friendly stuff, because I think that's really where this stuff is handy.
1248407	1249348	But what do I know?
1253106	1255167	I'm just waiting and waiting.
1255307	1257588	I know it's going to happen.
1257608	1266312	The PSP has got the memory stick port on it.
1266972	1275716	I'm sure they're going to release something that's going to plug into that damn thing that you're just going to be able to put some other format of movie on a flash card in that damn thing.
1277376	1277756	I don't know.
1277776	1281438	I don't see people going out and buying all these UMD format movies.
1282597	1283117	Why bother?
1283618	1284618	Why even, yeah.
1284638	1286019	I wouldn't even rent them.
1286900	1296826	Maybe portable, but... No, I mean, to be honest, if you've got your PSP, okay, and this is just my thought, if you've got your PSP and you're on a car ride, you're playing fucking games.
1297186	1298807	You're not even watching movies.
1299367	1303850	That's why you bought PSPs, to play the portable games, not to watch the movies.
1303930	1305891	It is portable PlayStation, not portable DVD.
1306692	1306852	But...
1307816	1308757	Nintendo is a trusted name.
1324918	1325959	Let's move on to another.
1326380	1330864	Actually, I wanted to say real quick, though, there is another Nintendo trademark that got filed.
1330904	1331685	This one's interesting.
1332105	1334708	It's PCGP.
1335209	1338031	And the way the logo looks is every letter is in a circle.
1338692	1343757	No idea what that could be about, but the speculation is perhaps the P is like Pokemon.
1344398	1346941	So maybe it's a new peripheral for some type of Pokemon game.
1347561	1348002	Who knows?
1350862	1357765	PCGP sounds like some new drug I don't know, Loki?
1359806	1360746	PC adapter to play?
1361126	1375332	No, if I was going to guess I would say maybe I'm probably going to be way off on this PC gaming portal in other words it's something for the DS if you have a wifi adapter or bluetooth or whatever to be playing over the internet with someone else.
1375713	1377493	Or to download more content.
1378234	1378754	Or something like that.
1380006	1383448	That guess is very cool, but I think you're wrong.
1383668	1387089	I don't know, it just seems a little early for that, but that's a very cool guess.
1387890	1399035	Well, it's a guess, but they will be announcing something of that sort at E3, so whether this be what it is, that will eventually happen, so that's that.
1399995	1400956	Very interesting.
1401116	1401396	All right.
1402452	1403393	One other quick story.
1403433	1414001	I know we don't talk about the N-Gage too much on here, and there's a reason for that, but I thought it would be interesting to mention that the X-Men Legends game, it's done pretty well on the consoles, actually, and it's not a bad game.
1414421	1415602	It kind of reminded me of Diablo.
1415622	1417563	It was like Diablo X-Men was kind of what it was.
1417964	1427130	But it's going to be coming to the N-Gage, which... The N-Gage seems very limited to me, and I just don't know how they're going to pull it off.
1428491	1429292	But whatever, it's...
1429818	1433140	I mean, they might as well put it on the Game Boy Color, but what do you think?
1434461	1441586	I think my cell phone, which is actually very similar to the N-Gage, is more useful than a freaking N-Gage because I don't have to taco-talk.
1444168	1452474	But the one cool thing about it, it will feature a wireless multiplayer mode, and that was one cool thing about X-Men Legends, that it had a multiplayer mode.
1452534	1457678	I mean, granted, you had to play for a little bit before you could get multiplayer with it, but it does have multiplayer mode, so...
1459318	1464021	I know none of us in here own an N-Gage, but hypothetically, if you did, would there be an interest in this?
1465081	1465301	No.
1466702	1469244	I would have to really question why I owned an N-Gage.
1470284	1473246	You'd have to find the other three people in the country that bought the N-Gage.
1474547	1483352	I mean, really, I had to laugh every time I walked by the N-Gage booth at E3 and all the people trying to get you to go in.
1485062	1488184	That was my favorite part because they were like, come on, check it out!
1488584	1490105	And I go play, I'm like, this is crap.
1491786	1492847	So, anyways.
1494068	1496070	Alright, one more quick story and then we're going to wrap it up.
1496490	1497611	I thought this was interesting.
1497671	1498651	I actually read this story.
1498691	1505316	It was a link that was on Slashdot earlier this week, specifically their games portion, games.slashdot.org, which is a very cool site.
1505356	1507238	Check it out if you haven't already.
1507318	1510580	If you're a nerd, chances are you're already very familiar with Slashdot, but maybe you're not.
1511341	1513102	They had a link to this article that talked about
1514366	1518548	How important are review scores in game buying, really?
1518889	1521690	And I thought I'd kind of pose that same question to us here in the studio.
1522190	1525572	How much do you pay attention to the reviews that a game gets?
1525672	1528314	Have you ever been influenced to buy a game based on the reviews?
1529634	1533897	And if not that, what does influence you to buy games, out of curiosity?
1533997	1534757	I'll start with Loki.
1535798	1543862	I don't really go by the numbers or whatever, but I'll listen to what they have to say about the game and consider those factors, you know, since they've played the game.
1545969	1547550	But a lot of times it really... That would be a review.
1549351	1551032	No shit, Sherlock.
1551553	1555976	I'm talking about like, I'm not going to say, okay, if he gives it a 10, I'm not going to go out and buy it just because he gives it a 10.
1556196	1558397	I have to look at the reasons why he's giving it a 10.
1559678	1559998	I don't know.
1560679	1564121	It's a good test so I can save my $5 and not rent the thing.
1564942	1566643	But I don't know.
1566963	1571826	I really, most of the time when it comes down to reviews, I don't really listen to reviews.
1571886	1574268	It's more buzz that I've heard about the game beforehand.
1574907	1575107	Angel
1596942	1605849	Pretty much what Loki said is what I do, except for the fact that I'll go to a friend's house or something that already bought it right away and I'll try it there.
1606449	1611113	It's pretty much a visual review, pretty much.
1611973	1612814	You know what I'm trying to say.
1613154	1614995	Yeah, you review by watching somebody else.
1615436	1618038	Or trying it myself afterwards and whatever.
1619078	1625503	Usually, probably about 95% of the time, I will end up getting the game that I try because it's just crazy.
1625774	1626455	I Ask My Friends
1640868	1642109	You know, I feel very similar.
1642849	1645990	Buzz does a lot more for me than an actual review.
1646171	1651913	Although, I have bought games based on reviews, but not necessarily because it got a glowing review.
1651973	1653994	Because everybody likes different types of games.
1654054	1659397	For instance, we don't talk a whole lot about sports-based games, although it's a huge market for gaming.
1659597	1660137	or FPS.
1685134	1688075	So maybe one of those games comes out and it gets a great score.
1688675	1693177	And perhaps it's a good game, but it's not really just the kind of game I want to play.
1693497	1697258	But at the same time, maybe a game comes out and it gets a pretty low score.
1697378	1702140	Case in point, DDR Ultramix 2 got a low score from one of those magazines out there.
1703580	1706661	But I say, yeah, Katamari even got some low scores out there.
1706701	1707221	Very few, though.
1707241	1708882	It was a pretty critically appreciated game.
1710086	1737841	but it's still you know I know I love that series of games so I'm going to pick it up anyway but sometimes there has been a game based on the review like maybe they have one on one of the TV networks they're reviewing a game and then I look at the game in motion I go oh that looks like kind of a cool game I want to pick that up like you remember Under the Skin we saw that on a review show I don't even think they gave it a good review but we were just like cool you can be an alien and like you know fuck with people so it looked like a cool game I played it all of one time
1741314	1744875	Anyway, if you guys have comments or feedback for our show, we always do appreciate that.
1744995	1752476	Email address is togo at orangeloungeradio.com T-O-G-O at orangeloungeradio.com We've got to wrap it up.
1752496	1754377	We're running kind of long tonight, guys.
1754397	1755817	We're almost at a half hour of a show here.
1755837	1756697	That's pretty long for us.
1757037	1758878	But I'm going to go around and get everybody's final thought.
1759118	1761598	Thank you very much for being here tonight, DDR Angel, and filling in.
1761858	1762599	You're welcome.
1762699	1763159	Final thought?
1764899	1765799	More Final Fantasy XI.
1766699	1768640	Bugged, thank you very much for filling in and being here tonight.
1768920	1769360	Absolutely.
1769380	1769900	Your final thought?
