1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Waiting for you, where are you? I can't find you

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:18,000
I'm here and waiting for you, I'll wait forever for you

3
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,000
No, no, no, no

4
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Why won't you come back down

5
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
As she, she

6
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Loves more than me

7
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:43,000
I thought I could love you better

8
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,000
But we're always together

9
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:52,000
And if we took some time apart

10
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:58,000
You would find me no more

11
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:03,000
I'm here and waiting for you

12
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Where are you? I can't find you

13
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:13,000
I'm here and waiting for you

14
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:19,000
And I'll wait forever for you

15
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:52,000
I've been lost when you went to me

16
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:57,000
I'm your dream

17
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:04,000
There's no sense when I'm the only room

18
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Without you

19
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:19,000
I'm here, I'm waiting for you Where are you? I can't find you

20
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:29,000
I'm here, I'm waiting for you I'll wait forever for you

21
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:36,000
I'm here, I'm waiting for you Where are you?

22
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:44,000
I cannot, I cannot find you I'm waiting for you

23
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Where are you? Where are you?

24
00:04:44,000 --> 00:05:12,000

Orange Lounge may contain plenty of...

35
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Just kidding, Orange Lounge Radio will not contain any of that in this episode.

36
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Well, isn't that special?

39
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:19,280
We are live, and this is episode number 133 for this, February the 27th of 2005.

40
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:27,800
You're tuned into the B-Money scene's most Oscar-worthy radio station of all things B-Money.

41
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:31,780
My name is Rob Roberts. You might know me as Sky. Joining me as always are my awesome

42
00:07:31,780 --> 00:07:36,780
co-hosts. Say hello to the happiest bunny on the farm, Ms. Jamie Summers, AKA, Dark

43
00:07:36,780 --> 00:07:44,100
Tekra. Fuck the Oscars. That's right, that's tonight's theme tonight. Fuck the Oscars.

44
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:50,900
The Oscar goes to me for being so great. Also joining us. I'm sorry, you can't win the Oscar

45
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:55,900
because you didn't get naked. I did not get naked this year. I might tonight, however.

46
00:07:55,900 --> 00:08:02,460
I'm getting the old thumbs up from our special guest, who we will get to momentarily after

47
00:08:02,460 --> 00:08:05,240
we introduce, Loki Tecmessa.

48
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:09,560
I have porn on one side and rights on the other.

49
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:17,120
That sounds like a very interesting porno I want, never mind.

50
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:22,800
Also joining us tonight, say hello to our very special guest who, believe it or not,

51
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:30,000
And 133 weeks of Orange Lounge Radio has never been to a live show, I do not believe.

52
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
No?

53
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Was there one other time?

54
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:36,880
There was the tournament and then there was when I did it at the house.

55
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:40,080
Okay, so, but it has never been here at the Orange Lounge Studios?

56
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:41,080
No, not here.

57
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:43,680
Alright, so make sure the mic's on, bud.

58
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:45,280
Make sure it's in the on position.

59
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:46,280
Really?

60
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:47,280
Into the microphone.

61
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:48,280
Hello.

62
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:49,280
Oh, there you go.

63
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:52,520
Say hello to Dan!

64
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:55,520
And why is Dan so special, Dark Sakura?

65
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:58,520
Uh, cause we're getting married one day.

66
00:08:58,520 --> 00:08:59,520
Cause I rock.

67
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:02,520
Dan is Dark Sakura's hetero-life mate.

68
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:05,520
Yes, my hetero-life mate.

69
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:11,520
So, this should be a very interesting show, because now I have someone to gang up on Jamie

70
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:12,520
with.

71
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:13,520
This is going to be fantastic.

72
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:18,520
Yeah, but when we get home, Dan's ass is going to be kicked.

73
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:20,520
I'd like to think that, wouldn't you?

74
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:23,360
Second five, I'll school you.

75
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:26,040
Loki, you're too busy eating on this show, always,

76
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:27,320
to make fun of Jamie with me.

77
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:28,160
I'm kidding.

78
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:30,240
I can't make fun of Jamie because she kicks my ass

79
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:32,920
and makes me cry.

80
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:36,000
Anyway, we will be back shortly after a quick break

81
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,360
to kick things off in tonight's show.

82
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:39,760
During tonight's show, by the way,

83
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:43,280
we're going to have a brand new song premiere for you guys.

84
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:44,840
Those of you guys with Xboxes, I'm

85
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:46,180
sure you already heard this one.

86
00:09:46,180 --> 00:09:49,440
It's the brand new In My Eyes mix from Song Pack 8.

Kiss me with a hammer, motherfucker to me

106
00:14:56,800 --> 00:15:01,800
Make me feel a little heavy

107
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:11,800
I don't know what to do

108
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:17,800
I don't know what to do

109
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:24,800
I don't know what to do

110
00:15:54,800 --> 00:16:20,280
After this song, we'll be having a Let Them Move marathon.

111
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:21,280
Nooooooo!

112
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:23,560

like to thank my mother and my father that was the best acceptance speech of

122
00:17:10,840 --> 00:17:15,800
all time when Fiona Apple got up there said she was drunk off her ass this is

123
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:19,200
like what the MTV Awards were like ten years ago almost at this point she gets

124
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:26,680
up there oh my god was that really ten years ago yeah living here when it

126
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:38,240
the stage she's like this world this world is bullshit go with yourself go

127
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:40,800
with yourself that's all I remember she's all go with yourself and then she

128
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:45,480
started spouting off about Maya Angelou and I know why the courage Berg sings I

129
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:51,980
it whatever anyway we'll start off tonight's show with the old favorites

130
00:17:51,980 --> 00:17:56,280
talking a little bit about ourselves our weeks and our days so you can further

131
00:17:56,280 --> 00:18:01,080
your stalking adventures of us Jamie start us off how was your week how was

132
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:06,300
your day I was diseased this week they like gave me the handbook for the

133
00:18:06,300 --> 00:18:13,440
recently diseased okay no one gets the Beetlejuice joke I've never you know I've

134
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:22,320
never seen Beetlejuice. We need to fix this! This is why I can't watch the Oscars, even

135
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:26,220
though they call it the Gay Man Super Bowl, and if you hadn't heard the little rumor going

136
00:18:26,220 --> 00:18:31,400
around about me, even though they call it the Gay Man Super Bowl, I can't watch this

137
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:37,360
program because I don't see any of the movies, like ever. I think this year, I've seen two

138
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:43,760
of the movies which is like more than ever. I would have to second that. I don't really

139
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:47,160
go to the movies that much anymore. And when I do go to the movies I usually see like four

140
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:51,960
and shit. I usually pick a movie and then see it a bajillion times. Like I saw Phantom

141
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:58,680
of the Opera twice. Well see I saw Rocky Horror Picture Show like 200 and something

142
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:04,560
times. 20 million times. If I have to see another period piece starring Leonardo DiCaprio

143
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:08,200
I am going to scream.

144
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:10,660
Or fucking Dame Judi Dench.

145
00:19:10,660 --> 00:19:15,400
Dame Judi Dench in every period piece there ever was. There's Dame Judi Dench.

146
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:19,680
Don't get me wrong, Dame Judi Dench is a great actress, but damn.

147
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:25,220
My week. Oh yeah, sorry. My week was spent in a coma.

148
00:19:25,220 --> 00:19:30,060
Well, more like being half in a coma and half playing Final Fantasy XI.

149
00:19:30,060 --> 00:19:34,420
Because I did not have the energy to move out of my chair.

150
00:19:34,420 --> 00:19:42,440
it'll do that to you. No. I basically ran a fever. The highest it was when I checked

151
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:51,640
was 103. And it's like Friday, like Saturday, I stopped running a fever. I went to the doctor.

152
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:58,420
She said, your ass ain't going to work. And basically I had some type of viral infection

153
00:19:58,420 --> 00:20:04,940
that almost became, she said that it was leaving me very open to bacteria, and that it was

154
00:20:04,940 --> 00:20:09,320
basically settled in my sinuses, and I had fluid in my ears, so I was having bad vertigo

155
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:15,720
and everything, it was fun. Who needs drugs when you have sicknesses? And so I got prescription

156
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:21,940
stuff, yay, drank lots of water, and danced with me for ribs Friday. There were some good

157
00:20:21,940 --> 00:20:26,740
ribs. Mmm ribs! We went to Tony Roma's, and I felt crappy while I was there. I've never

158
00:20:26,740 --> 00:20:33,060
been to Tony Romo's. And then he bought a whole bunch of wrestling DVDs at Dimple.

159
00:20:43,060 --> 00:20:49,620
And what else did I do? Oh yeah, yesterday we cleaned our room and found the floor.

160
00:20:49,620 --> 00:20:58,140
we threw away like two years worth of crap um I got disconnected from the chat

161
00:20:58,140 --> 00:21:01,980
room shut up

162
00:21:04,980 --> 00:21:12,940
but I also well what else did I do oh yeah today we went and bought like lots

163
00:21:12,940 --> 00:21:20,300
of stuff, and had dinner, and that was it. And I got second five! Which is, even though

164
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:27,260
I haven't played the home version yet, the most awesome game in the world. That's it.

165
00:21:27,260 --> 00:21:31,620
Alright, Loki! I know you're trying to eat, but it's your turn. How was your week, how

166
00:21:31,620 --> 00:21:42,340
was your day? So anyways, I was chewing, and then stuff happened. No, um, right now, since

167
00:21:42,340 --> 00:21:46,780
I had sort of like lunch for breakfast I'm having breakfast for dinner you know

168
00:21:46,780 --> 00:21:50,660
just to kind of balance things out. You're having a dyslexic meal day!

169
00:21:50,660 --> 00:21:55,940
Exactly I'm having you know it's actually pretty good for me

170
00:21:55,940 --> 00:22:03,020
Crispix it's damn good and you know I've already eaten half the box holy crap

171
00:22:03,020 --> 00:22:09,820
there's not much in there anyways so yeah this week what I do okay to start

172
00:22:09,820 --> 00:22:14,280
things off first off computer was out of commission we do remember that on Sunday

173
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:20,320
commuter it was gone I was like you know I can wait a week until I get paid next

174
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:28,200
to fix it that's okay so the next day so I watched robot chicken robot chicken

175
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:32,740
is fucking hilarious I don't normally endorse television programs however I

176
00:22:32,740 --> 00:22:38,840
will endorse robot chicken tonight 1130 comedy okay cartoon network

177
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:43,720
And if you're on the East Coast, you better be taping it, because we're still on at that time.

178
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:48,720
Okay. Cartoon Network. Fucking awesome. Best 15 minutes of your life.

179
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:52,160
That's 15 minutes, man. Think about it. I mean, that's...

180
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:56,280
You got 15 minutes still left over after it's done to watch something else.

181
00:22:56,280 --> 00:23:01,360
Perfect. Anyways, so definitely watch that. It's hilarious.

182
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:05,040
I honestly... I'm glad it was only 15 minutes long, because I was laughing so hard,

183
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:08,160
I probably would have passed out if it was any longer, so...

184
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:10,160
It was great.

185
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:19,160
Then, because remember, you have organic internal organs and you can get cancer.

186
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:25,160
Anyways, everybody who saw Robot Chicken is kind of chuckling.

187
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:28,160
They're not really laughing because it wasn't that funny, but they're chuckling a little bit.

188
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:30,160
Anybody who didn't see it is going,

189
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:34,160
Loki, shut up. I don't get you.

190
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:56,160
Um, the rest of the week, um, was filled with, uh, watching, um, well, actually, just playing, uh, Final Fantasy XI, and, um, I tried actually playing Final Fantasy X2, but then I realized that for some reason, whatever, for some reason I realized the cheat device would not work with it.

191
00:23:56,160 --> 00:24:06,160
So, um, that, uh, that stopped pretty quick. That got really annoying. I just, I could not stand the voice acting, and it was just, please stop.

192
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:15,160
And then, what else did we play? Oh, the guy game! Played some of the guy game, and that was hilarious because the woman looked like she exploded.

193
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:31,160
I actually played the guy game last night with him and with Loki and his girlfriend and one of Loki's other friends and my friend Christopher was just kind of sitting in the corner playing DS going what's wrong with you people.

194
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:37,160
But I was playing the guy game. I owned at the guy game. I just like point out.

195
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:38,160
He was president.

196
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:39,160
Did you get boobies?

197
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:42,240
I got my girl to give me a lap dance at the end.

198
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:45,880
Except my girl looked like a dude.

199
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:49,520
So I was right.

200
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:54,440
But I mean she looked okay when it wasn't like a still photo of her when

201
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:56,600
she was kind of in motion she looked alright.

202
00:24:56,600 --> 00:24:59,920
But the still photos did not do that girl justice.

203
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:02,800
It was like somewhere between Tori Spelling and Bea Arthur.

204
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:06,640
Seriously there was this one picture of her where she, what was the name of the model

205
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:11,320
in the game. I don't remember. She's the one that looks like a horse.

206
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:15,200
We didn't know China was in the guy game.

207
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:16,400
So anyways, yeah.

208
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:19,920
So we did that. I went and played some horse crack because I had to get rid of

209
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:24,520
some of my tokens left over from that horrible place called Golfland.

210
00:25:24,520 --> 00:25:26,020
And uh... I still...

211
00:25:26,020 --> 00:25:30,820
You know, my boycott still exists. You know, I just have to get rid of these tokens so that I'm

212
00:25:30,820 --> 00:25:32,380
you know, rid of their evil.

213
00:25:32,380 --> 00:25:33,880
And uh...

214
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:43,280
But I have to say, I eat children, my horse, in Derby Cracker, kickin' ass, and, um, what

215
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:44,280
else do I do?

216
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:45,280
Well, that's pretty much it.

217
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:48,320
Just kinda hung around.

218
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:55,360
You know, I retired a horse, like, in two days, when they got a doc over there.

219
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:57,080
This is so weird.

220
00:25:57,080 --> 00:26:01,120
I haven't really been to Golf Land in, like, I don't know, four months.

221
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:05,160
I hear Country Club Lanes has In The Groove, but I'm too lazy to go over there and play

222
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:06,160
it.

223
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:07,760
What the hell am I doing this show for?

224
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:08,760
I don't know.

225
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:11,320
But, honestly, they had a new Sega shooter there.

226
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:12,320
That was kind of neat.

227
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:13,480
That game is awesome.

228
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:14,480
I didn't actually get to see it.

229
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:15,480
Go Squad?

230
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:16,480
Yeah.

231
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:17,480
That game is really fun.

232
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:18,480
Dan and I played it.

233
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:19,480
I didn't really get to play anything else.

234
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:24,720
You know, I'm really just, you know, the DDR is kind of getting old as far as, you know,

235
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:26,920
there's not been really new coming out.

236
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:30,960
And I'm starting to, like, take interest in the other arcade games again, you know.

237
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:37,960
you know, where when I was in the DDRs, kinda like, other arcade games, eh, fuck them, you know, I'm just playing DDR, you know, where now...

238
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:40,960
DDR's got a line.

239
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:44,960
Yeah, that was it, actually. There was a ton of people standing around the damn thing.

240
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:50,960
Is DDR going through a renaissance right now? Because, like, there's fucking tons of people always playing it, when I'm actually...

241
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:51,960
When I am at an arcade?

242
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:56,960
No one's playing Derby Owners Club, at all. Maybe one other person, that's why I came in second and third.

243
00:26:56,960 --> 00:27:02,960
Extreme is what? Like two and a half years old now, and it's still getting these huge crowds.

244
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:04,960
And Max 2? Crazy.

245
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:09,960
There is more people on Max 2. Probably that's because the Extreme pads are fucked up.

246
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:17,960
I went and played Guitar Freaks yesterday. One, my left hand hurt like a bitch, because I'm just not used to playing it anymore.

247
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:21,960
Guess I gotta start masturbating with my left hand now, you know, get it used to that kind of stuff.

248
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:28,160
But um, but their fucking green button on there was messed up. It was like, you couldn't put it on there.

249
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:29,960
Damn that fucking green button!

250
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:46,760
Seriously, I was failing songs because of it! Fuck them! And their crappy stuff, yeah I guess you know, they got tired of, they wanted to save money apparently, cause you know, after all they ripped me off on money, so why not? Let's just not fix anything.

251
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:53,760
I hear they're actually going to get a fourth DDR machine, which will be in the groove, so that's rumored.

252
00:27:53,760 --> 00:28:00,760
Fuck them, anyways. It's another machine that they won't maintain. I'm done.

253
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:09,760
Well, my weekend, my day was pretty good. I mean, gosh, Loki already kind of hit on some of the stuff I wanted to talk about, like the guy game thing going on last night.

254
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:14,840
last night that was kind of fun and you know just kind of went out earlier this

255
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:19,560
week and I've been busy with work though it's had me really exhausted so I've

256
00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:23,000
been just napping a whole lot been playing a lot of Final Fantasy 11 of

257
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:27,480
course and boy did I just hit my point of frustration today I just want to quit

258
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:32,880
that game because I'm on this quest right now that you have to do you have

259
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:37,320
to do it if you want to get past level 50 and it is a bitch and it's very hard

260
00:28:37,320 --> 00:28:40,120
to get people to help you with it because everybody knows it's a bitch but

261
00:28:40,120 --> 00:28:43,840
finally I had some people helping me today with it and so I was very happy

262
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:51,880
but we all died I died twice I was just upset I was crying made me want to quit

263
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:56,240
and then otherwise I've been playing a little bit of DS I decided to start

264
00:28:56,240 --> 00:29:00,840
playing Final Fantasy 2 on my GBA last night or not maybe actually DS but GBA

265
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:04,760
mode because I haven't really played Final Fantasy 2 ever and at first I was

266
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:27,760
I was like, well, I have to beat Final Fantasy I before I can play Final Fantasy II, but I got sick of Final Fantasy I, so I want to get back into Final Fantasy II and see what it's really all about, because I know very little about the game and the story. I mean, I know bits and pieces here and there. And I recognized the song in the beginning, because everybody knows that Imperial March song that's in Final Fantasy II, so that was cool.

267
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:31,680
and gosh outside of that not really a whole lot

268
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:35,240
I am not that exciting this week or any week

269
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:39,760
to be honest it's kind of sad let's move on

270
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:43,240
Dan would you like to share with us how your week is and how your days going and

271
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:43,840
all that stuff?

272
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:47,160
I had to deal with a sick Jamie all week

273
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:50,920
I'm sure you could all relate with how much fun that is

274
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:54,480
do you give her a bell when she's sick like she can ring a bell

275
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:57,600
Yeah, that's all she needs.

276
00:29:57,600 --> 00:30:01,280
Another way to make more noise.

277
00:30:01,280 --> 00:30:02,560
No, actually it was pretty good.

278
00:30:02,560 --> 00:30:04,440
I took a bunch of days off this week,

279
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:05,880
which turned out to be good timing,

280
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:07,000
because even though she was sick,

281
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,000
it let me spend a lot of time at home with Jamie,

282
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,920
and we had fun.

283
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:12,800
Aw.

284
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:15,280
Well, I managed to get her to clean the bedroom, which

285
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:16,520
five years.

286
00:30:16,520 --> 00:30:18,680
Not two years, five years.

287
00:30:18,680 --> 00:30:21,000
We unpacked stuff I hadn't seen since I packed it

288
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,460
before we moved into that apartment.

289
00:30:22,460 --> 00:30:24,280
It was bad.

290
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:27,180
I'm gonna be moving in April, and I'm very much dreading it.

291
00:30:27,180 --> 00:30:29,480
I... oh god, it's gonna suck.

292
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:31,880
I swear to god, I'm gonna call 1-800-JUNK. Anyway.

293
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:32,880
1-800-GARBAGE.

294
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:35,080
That 1-800-GET-JUNK, or whatever it is?

295
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:35,680
Yeah.

296
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:36,280
GOT-JUNK.

297
00:30:36,280 --> 00:30:38,280
1-800-GOT-TOLD.

298
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:41,080
Haven't had a lot of chance to do a lot of gaming,

299
00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:43,080
which is kind of bizarre since I've been at home all week.

300
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:45,480
Sucks, but hey, whatcha gonna do?

301
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:49,480
Am I supposed to be talking soon?

302
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:51,080
Oh, yeah, it's cool, it's cool.

303
00:30:51,080 --> 00:30:59,080
Our show is in constant need of stretch. More! More!

304
00:30:59,080 --> 00:31:04,080
Well, now for those who don't know, you're okay with me mentioning what you do for a living?

305
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:09,080
I work for the evil empire of gaming. GameStop.

306
00:31:09,080 --> 00:31:14,080
We crush all independent video game stores beneath our heels. Including mine.

307
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:18,080
I was going to say you work for a major video game dealer, but since you said it.

308
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:22,800
GameStop, Marconi, buy all your dance dance stuff from us.

309
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:25,680
I have like 15 ignition pads, okay?

310
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:27,160
I need somebody to buy them.

311
00:31:27,160 --> 00:31:32,960
I'm coming on this show because I need you guys to buy ignition pads from the GameStop

312
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:33,960
on Marconi.

313
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:37,520
You go to any other GameStop, it doesn't fucking help me.

314
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:39,440
You gotta buy them from me, please.

315
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:41,160
I sold five in one week.

316
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:43,560
The company said, oh, these things are hot.

317
00:31:43,560 --> 00:31:46,720
Sent me like seven cases of them.

318
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:52,320
There's two per case. I can't get rid of them. They're $100 a piece. I saw the $20 ones like

319
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:55,240
they're going out of style. Someone buy an ignition pad. Please.

320
00:31:55,240 --> 00:31:58,760
You know, I went to GameStop to buy an ignition pad once. It wasn't yours. But...

321
00:31:58,760 --> 00:32:01,960
Yeah, yeah, yeah. You see how that works? Fucker.

322
00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:05,480
Are you doing another GameStop to buy an ignition pad?

323
00:32:05,480 --> 00:32:10,320
Now I'm taking over your show. I needed an ignition pad now. At least I went

324
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:14,680
to GameStop. Yeah. Because that really helps me.

325
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:17,680
I'm sorry, I thought there was this whole corporate synergy thing going on.

326
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:21,680
At least I supported your opposition. You see, they make us compete. We fight to the death.

327
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:27,680
And I usually win because, let's be honest, the rest of the GameStop managers in this area, posers.

328
00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:32,680
But really, by ignition pad, GameStop, Marconi and Fulton.

329
00:32:32,680 --> 00:32:37,680
Marconi and Fulton, yes. So if you disagree with Dan's comments, come see him in person.

330
00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:39,680
Come on by.

331
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:45,460
I mean, I'm already on the webcam, you know what I look like, you ain't gonna miss me.

332
00:32:45,460 --> 00:32:50,320
If you're in the Sacramento area, you are hereby obligated to shop at my store.

333
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:54,080
Get all this dance dance crap out of my store.

334
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:58,880
I'll get new dance dance crap and that's fine.

335
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:04,760
You know, I went into your competing game stop once and I went and bought a new ignition

336
00:33:04,760 --> 00:33:05,760
pad.

337
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:12,840
like whoa you're actually buying an ignition pad I don't think I've ever

338
00:33:12,840 --> 00:33:20,320
seen anyone buy one Wow are you sure that's what you want like I'm like way

339
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:23,880
to sell it buddy way to sell it it's because aren't you supposed to ask me if

340
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:28,320
I want to pre-order the next fucking pad or something because of my involvement

341
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:32,320
with you guys with Jamie I know how shit-hot the ignition pad is it is

342
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:38,400
it's supposed to be. I've never used one, but I know it's supposed to be frickin' unbelievable.

343
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:45,280
If you're gonna play DDR at home, seriously, at all, you should spend the money and get

344
00:33:45,280 --> 00:33:51,520
one. Because the $20 pads ain't worth your time. No, no, they suck. But yeah, so I pimped

345
00:33:51,520 --> 00:33:55,600
a bunch of them one week and we were feeling real good about that. Boom rang around, bit

346
00:33:55,600 --> 00:34:05,040
me in the come by ignition pads from me please. I have these pads over here that I don't even

347
00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:11,520
use. So sad. Use them with your sick ass arcade machine. I do use them with my sick ass arcade

348
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:19,000
machine. My problem is the sick ass static electricity is created by the sick ass Lexan

349
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:26,960
that's in there it kind of you know fries my sick-ass keyboard encoder board

350
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:32,840
and that doesn't work very well static it'll stop you so I just I need to

351
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:38,160
ground those pads and then we'll be all good because goddamn it they were

352
00:34:38,160 --> 00:34:47,240
expensive enough to build I don't need to be buying anymore no more anyways and

353
00:34:47,240 --> 00:34:52,240
And besides, the whole reason I built the cabinet and these pads is so I didn't have to go back to Golfland.

354
00:34:52,240 --> 00:34:56,240
Now they've just, you know, finalized that by trying to rip me off.

355
00:34:56,240 --> 00:34:58,240
So...

356
00:34:58,240 --> 00:35:01,240
Perfect! It's all coming to play.

357
00:35:01,240 --> 00:35:04,240
The purpose of GameStop is to rip people off and kill their soul.

358
00:35:07,240 --> 00:35:10,240
We sell the GameStop. Or MovieStop.

359
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:13,240
Yeah.

360
00:35:13,240 --> 00:35:14,240
Wait, wait.

361
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:16,240
There's actually a company called MovieStop now?

362
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:21,740
They're kicking the idea around for out here.

363
00:35:21,740 --> 00:35:28,740
Yeah, and they're buying games, or not games, but they're movies for their GameStops also from us.

364
00:35:28,740 --> 00:35:35,740
We have a person that works in my key accounts department that doesn't know shit about anything, and he sells to them.

365
00:35:35,740 --> 00:35:40,740
Ironically, when I was in Mobile, there was one right next door to an EB.

366
00:35:40,740 --> 00:35:47,740
but yeah

367
00:35:48,580 --> 00:35:54,660
okay so so the GameStop on one hand is an evil empire but on the other hand you need to get rid of those

368
00:35:54,660 --> 00:35:56,820
ignition pads so come to the GameStop and

369
00:35:56,820 --> 00:36:01,380
hey they're an evil empire but they sign the paychecks at the end of the week

370
00:36:01,380 --> 00:36:04,460
I get to sell video games for a living

371
00:36:04,460 --> 00:36:08,540
at least they're not Walmart yeah now that's an evil empire

372
00:36:08,540 --> 00:36:10,540
A giant evil empire.

373
00:36:10,540 --> 00:36:17,540
You know what? Starbucks is an evil empire, too, but that doesn't make Frappuccinos taste any less, you know, yeah, seriously.

374
00:36:17,540 --> 00:36:21,540
I mean, Starbucks, actually, from what I understand, Starbucks treats its employees pretty well.

375
00:36:21,540 --> 00:36:23,540
I know people that work at Starbucks and they have nice things to say about it.

376
00:36:23,540 --> 00:36:26,540
My understanding is that Starbucks managers make bank.

377
00:36:26,540 --> 00:36:27,540
Yeah, so Starbucks...

378
00:36:27,540 --> 00:36:28,540
Stock options...

379
00:36:28,540 --> 00:36:33,540
But yet people hate Starbucks because it's killing all the independent coffee shops or whatever.

380
00:36:33,540 --> 00:36:36,540
Dude, did you ever go to an independent coffee shop?

381
00:36:36,540 --> 00:36:37,540
No, you didn't.

382
00:36:37,540 --> 00:36:41,160
Actually, I did. Shut up. You're screwing up my argument. I did.

383
00:36:41,160 --> 00:36:45,520
I did, but... Okay, did you go to it a lot? No, I didn't go to it a lot. Have you gone to Starbucks more?

384
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:49,520
And the independent coffee shop did not have a drive-thru. Yeah.

385
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:54,360
And that's really the clincher for Starbucks, is that if I can, like, drive home

386
00:36:54,360 --> 00:36:58,340
and, you know, pick up a... pick up a mocha latte, frappa

387
00:36:58,340 --> 00:37:02,320
lotta coffee chocino thing... They weren't... they didn't have drive-thrus

388
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:06,160
and they weren't in the mall. If you work at the mall, you drink Starbucks.

389
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:09,800
because they pump something through the air. I don't drink Starbucks, but when I worked

390
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:12,040
at the wall, I drink Starbucks like a fucking fiend.

391
00:37:12,040 --> 00:37:16,480
Could it be the smell of coffee in the air? No, it's not. The ball doesn't smell like

392
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:18,440
it. You go to the mall, does it smell like coffee?

393
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:21,960
Subliminal messages in the Muzak. It is funny though. If you get ice water from

394
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:28,080
Starbucks and you drink it, it tastes like coffee. I'm frigging serious, man. Try it.

395
00:37:28,080 --> 00:37:31,520
Just try it. And they won't turn you down because it's like a corporate mandate from

396
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:35,360
Starbucks. If you ask for water, they got to give you water. Not to mention, you know,

397
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:41,660
humanity I hate it when I go into places and you ask for water and this is

398
00:37:41,660 --> 00:37:47,560
especially bad at places that have a DDR machine ie Roseville Golf Land sucks you

399
00:37:47,560 --> 00:37:52,460
want to go and you go to play DDR and then you work up a sweat and you want to

400
00:37:52,460 --> 00:38:03,440
go get a nice glass ice water that'll be 25 cents for the cop then then they

401
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:08,440
They won't do it? No, probably not, because they'll claim it's unsanitary or something. I haven't tried it.

402
00:38:08,440 --> 00:38:13,440
I just end up going off in a huff to the drinking fountain. Mike, you bastards, I'm pumping in a-

403
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:18,440
The drinking fountain is scary. It's got like gum and like tobacco and it's like, what the crap?

404
00:38:18,440 --> 00:38:26,440
There's no way in hell I'm going to win my Oscar pool. I like lost like the last three or four or five.

405
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:31,440
Ah, dammit. Anyways, sorry to derail that whole train.

406
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:34,440
You poor, poor bastard. Anyway, back to me.

407
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:42,440
I don't know, let's go to break.

408
00:38:42,440 --> 00:38:44,440
Do we get to break things on break?

409
00:38:44,440 --> 00:38:50,440
Uh, possibly, because the music that we're gonna play might be something that you wanna break some music- or break some stuff to.

410
00:38:50,440 --> 00:38:52,440
If it's voluntary?

411
00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:54,440
No, actually it's gonna be athletics.

412
00:38:54,440 --> 00:38:55,440
Woohoo!

413
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:58,440
And some folks wanted to hear War Game, so I was gonna indulge that request.

414
00:38:58,440 --> 00:39:00,440
I have a vote for Disco Dog.

415
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:04,120
we will we will get disco dog in there as well and some other athletic favorite

416
00:39:04,120 --> 00:39:04,680
songs

417
00:39:04,680 --> 00:39:08,200
and then we're gonna come back and we're gonna talk a little bit about Bomani

418
00:39:08,200 --> 00:39:11,680
no yeah we got we got news

419
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:14,720
we got big Gita Dora news big news

420
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:17,840
and we also have big UltraMix 2 stuff

421
00:39:17,840 --> 00:39:21,440
even more Lou that earns a squee

422
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:26,280
now do the are the ignition pads the PlayStation 2 and Xbox kind that have both

423
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:27,520
yeah they're the dual compatible

424
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:32,420
And you know, cause you know what's funny is that when this DDR, I don't think they

425
00:39:32,420 --> 00:39:35,600
do either, but you know what's funny is that if this Dance Dance Revolution with Mario

426
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:40,440
comes out in the US, which we all expect it will, they'll have to have new ignition pads

427
00:39:40,440 --> 00:39:41,440
that have all three.

428
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:45,680
Incidentally, while we're on the subject of Dance Dance Revolution with Mario, which needs

429
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:51,400
to come out because the videos are hilarious, has anybody here played that, whatever it

430
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:54,400
is, MC Groove's Dance Beat?

431
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:57,840
I have only heard of the atrocities of this game.

432
00:39:57,840 --> 00:40:04,240
I have never sold a copy.

433
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:09,320
They sent me some, we put a box out, we had them sitting around.

434
00:40:09,320 --> 00:40:12,440
People like look at it, they see the box, they like run away screaming.

435
00:40:12,440 --> 00:40:13,440
Who released it?

436
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:14,440
Is it THQ or something?

437
00:40:14,440 --> 00:40:16,480
All I can say is send it back.

438
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:18,720
I can't send it back.

439
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:22,480
The company store, they sent me the shit they want in it.

440
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:26,080
You need to go put it on their doorstep and ring the doorbell and run.

441
00:40:26,080 --> 00:40:27,080
And light it on fire.

442
00:40:27,080 --> 00:40:33,320
Then when they step in it like they're burning Coleco plastic, they'll be like, noooo!

443
00:40:33,320 --> 00:40:34,320
It's pretty bad.

444
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:35,320
Yeah, that's right here.

445
00:40:35,320 --> 00:40:36,320
It's really, really bad.

446
00:40:36,320 --> 00:40:38,680
It's actually by Mad Cats, the same company...

447
00:40:38,680 --> 00:40:39,680
That's right, Mad Cats.

448
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:42,440
The same company that makes those $20 dance pads.

449
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:46,560
The Beat Pad.

450
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:51,400
Because after you play with them, you want to beat yourself with a stick, honestly.

451
00:40:51,400 --> 00:40:52,400
It's bad.

452
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:56,120
full versions of songs, and you'd think that would be a good thing because as like parents

453
00:40:56,120 --> 00:41:01,320
just don't understand and stuff, but there's really nothing else to it. I mean, besides

454
00:41:01,320 --> 00:41:09,320
the somewhat interesting music, the steps don't make any sense at all, and the visuals

455
00:41:09,320 --> 00:41:14,620
leave a lot to be desired. The entire game, without the music, is probably about the size

456
00:41:14,620 --> 00:41:21,100
where it would fit on a three and a half inch floppy disk to use in your GameCube floppy

457
00:41:21,100 --> 00:41:27,340
drive. Anyway, let's go to break. We're gonna start it off with some War Game. We'll be

458
00:41:27,340 --> 00:41:34,340
We'll be back after this with more Orange Lounge Radio.

459
00:41:57,340 --> 00:41:59,340
To have a fun like a girl turn on a movie

460
00:41:59,340 --> 00:42:02,340
People suffer, die, that's right, I'm looking out for you

461
00:42:02,340 --> 00:42:04,340
I'm put on my ass, I'm put on my kid

462
00:42:04,340 --> 00:42:06,340
Put your money in my pocket, just to pull it down

463
00:42:06,340 --> 00:42:09,340
I'm put on my ass, I'm put on my kid

464
00:42:09,340 --> 00:42:12,340
Sleep when it rains, I'm feeling so good

465
00:42:12,340 --> 00:42:14,340
How many people can I think about it?

466
00:42:14,340 --> 00:42:16,340
No matter who you are, and who I don't wanna be

467
00:42:16,340 --> 00:42:20,340
This city has a different reality, no about the enemy

468
00:42:20,340 --> 00:42:22,340
Where I feel the curse from the cash flow is this

469
00:42:22,340 --> 00:42:26,340
Everybody who I have, you don't have to think on your best

470
00:46:56,340 --> 00:47:19,940
I got the blood in me I got the blood in me

471
00:47:19,940 --> 00:47:23,940
You're gonna let it be

472
00:47:24,940 --> 00:47:26,940
I gotta let it get out

473
00:47:26,940 --> 00:47:29,940
I gotta let it

474
00:47:29,940 --> 00:47:30,940
I'm holding it

475
00:47:30,940 --> 00:47:31,940
If you don't feel it

476
00:47:31,940 --> 00:47:32,940
for my baby

477
00:47:32,940 --> 00:47:33,940
I wanna be

478
00:47:33,940 --> 00:47:34,940
both of us

479
00:47:34,940 --> 00:47:35,940
Don't let it be

480
00:47:35,940 --> 00:47:36,940
Oh my

481
00:47:36,940 --> 00:47:40,940
Oh my

482
00:47:40,940 --> 00:47:42,940
Oh my

483
00:47:42,940 --> 00:47:47,940
Oh my

484
00:47:47,940 --> 00:47:48,940
Oh my

485
00:48:48,940 --> 00:49:00,940
We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio. During the break there, Dan was talking to me about a little bit of the celebrity that he gets from being the dude from GameStop.

486
00:49:00,940 --> 00:49:04,940
What was some of the stuff? You were telling me you get harassed in restaurants and things?

487
00:49:04,940 --> 00:49:11,940
Well, we just got an IM or a message from someone who thought that they knew who I was.

488
00:49:11,940 --> 00:49:12,940
Right.

489
00:49:12,940 --> 00:49:17,280
You don't know me.

490
00:49:17,280 --> 00:49:22,100
But it's like you manage a video game store and you're shocked because you see all these

491
00:49:22,100 --> 00:49:24,780
people come through your store and some of them you get to know because they come in

492
00:49:24,780 --> 00:49:25,780
a lot.

493
00:49:25,780 --> 00:49:30,500
Some of them you start to dread seeing and you know who I'm talking to if you're listening.

494
00:49:30,500 --> 00:49:33,680
You're not listening, I know.

495
00:49:33,680 --> 00:49:40,060
And sometimes it's like you can be, I was a thousand miles from home, I was at E3 and

496
00:49:40,060 --> 00:49:44,100
guy walks up to me and he's like, I know you from somewhere. I'm like, you should know

497
00:49:44,100 --> 00:49:51,140
me. I'm famous. I just wonder. Do you know me? I am so famous. But he figured out who

498
00:49:51,140 --> 00:49:55,820
I was and he ran into me again and he's like, he's like, you're the guy from GameStop. And

499
00:49:55,820 --> 00:49:58,920
I'm thinking, wow, this guy's probably been sitting here that whole goddamn show, three

500
00:49:58,920 --> 00:50:04,360
days of video games, thinking, where the hell did I know that guy from? You've been in that

501
00:50:04,360 --> 00:50:07,740
position though, haven't you before, where you swear to God you recognize somebody and

502
00:50:07,740 --> 00:50:11,180
can't think of where you know him from and it just preys on your mind.

503
00:50:11,180 --> 00:50:14,100
It's obvious and like I said, it's just I thought it was pathetic that it wasn't like

504
00:50:14,100 --> 00:50:17,340
I was trying to think of someone who might have been a childhood friend or a grade school

505
00:50:17,340 --> 00:50:21,300
buddy. This was the guy who came to me and bought Final Fantasy II weeks ago.

506
00:50:21,300 --> 00:50:28,300
Dude, you delivered my pizza once. Damn, you didn't bring me any peppers. You

507
00:50:28,300 --> 00:50:34,100
bastard. So yeah, it's freaky freaky.

508
00:50:34,100 --> 00:50:37,600
I used to get that sometimes back when I did Rocky Horror Picture Show and I was still

509
00:50:37,600 --> 00:50:42,120
around and I was emceeing and I would do the big beginning where we had like the virgin

510
00:50:42,120 --> 00:50:43,120
sacrifice.

511
00:50:43,120 --> 00:50:44,800
Just everyone knows who Rob is anyway.

512
00:50:44,800 --> 00:50:45,800
Big dumb fun.

513
00:50:45,800 --> 00:50:46,800
Well, whatever.

514
00:50:46,800 --> 00:50:49,680
I've had people walk up to me and be like, you know Rob, don't you?

515
00:50:49,680 --> 00:50:50,680
Shut up.

516
00:50:50,680 --> 00:50:51,680
Duh!

517
00:50:51,680 --> 00:50:56,600
I, uh, no, but I would be at the mall or something and like these girls would walk by me and

518
00:50:56,600 --> 00:51:03,600
going like, you're the guy who took my virginity!

519
00:51:04,880 --> 00:51:11,880
I'm like, don't say that with your mother there!

520
00:51:11,880 --> 00:51:17,880
Trust me, it wasn't me. Bye!

521
00:51:17,880 --> 00:51:18,880
That's no good.

522
00:51:18,880 --> 00:51:23,640
I've had that happen. I'm just like, oh my god.

523
00:51:23,640 --> 00:51:27,640
Tell your mother you mean you're Rocky, and what were you doing out after midnight anyway?

524
00:51:27,640 --> 00:51:29,640
Your mom probably thought that was worse.

525
00:51:29,640 --> 00:51:30,640
What? You were at Rocky?

526
00:51:30,640 --> 00:51:31,640
You were at Rocky? What did you do that at?

527
00:51:31,640 --> 00:51:32,640
Just what?

528
00:51:36,640 --> 00:51:40,640
Well, years ago, years upon years ago, I used to have a public access show,

529
00:51:40,640 --> 00:51:44,640
which actually kind of leads into the week, or leads back to the week and day stuff,

530
00:51:44,640 --> 00:51:48,640
because we were so bored, what was this, last night or Friday night?

531
00:51:48,640 --> 00:51:49,640
It must have been Friday night.

532
00:51:49,640 --> 00:51:55,680
so bored and I was in one of those moods where I actually dug up a copy of my old public

533
00:51:55,680 --> 00:52:00,120
access show and I put it on and I let my friends watch it that were here.

534
00:52:00,120 --> 00:52:01,120
That was hilarious.

535
00:52:01,120 --> 00:52:02,120
That would have been awesome.

536
00:52:02,120 --> 00:52:03,120
I'm sorry I missed that.

537
00:52:03,120 --> 00:52:06,640
Oh my god, what was I letting myself be subjected to with that?

538
00:52:06,640 --> 00:52:07,640
I don't know.

539
00:52:07,640 --> 00:52:08,960
Loki actually caught some of it.

540
00:52:08,960 --> 00:52:09,960
Any thoughts?

541
00:52:09,960 --> 00:52:13,880
It was, uh, strange.

542
00:52:13,880 --> 00:52:18,360
So you know, I used to, because it used to be on public access in this area, so you know

543
00:52:18,360 --> 00:52:24,000
know, when I'd be out at the mall, people would kind of be looking at me like, isn't

544
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:28,560
that that gay guy from TV? They're like, I don't want to admit that I watch it, but I

545
00:52:28,560 --> 00:52:33,720
want to approach it. I don't want anyone to... That's what you do, is they approach you,

546
00:52:33,720 --> 00:52:38,000
and they're like, didn't I see you on TV, and you just start pointing at, just laughing.

547
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:42,280
You watch that? You got a problem. You need to go do something. They don't want to admit

548
00:52:42,280 --> 00:52:45,760
they watch public access. Well, of course, they don't want to, you know, the boomerangs

549
00:52:45,760 --> 00:52:49,880
back around. And a show that I was a part of, nonetheless, on public access. See, you're

550
00:52:49,880 --> 00:52:56,800
missing, don't implicate yourself. Sorry, my twin. Exactly. Well, the point is mad humiliation

551
00:52:56,800 --> 00:53:02,760
of them while taking none of the responsibility on yourself, even though you're wholly responsible.

552
00:53:02,760 --> 00:53:05,760
You know what, you know what it was with the show, and I've talked to my former co-host

553
00:53:05,760 --> 00:53:11,360
about this before, we were just ahead of our time. Yeah. Really? Exactly. We were. Because

554
00:53:11,360 --> 00:53:15,120
eventually everything's in style. Give, give the show about ten more years, it'll be ripe

555
00:53:15,120 --> 00:53:23,600
and funny. I'd like to think that. Anyway, moving on, let's talk about some actual

556
00:53:23,600 --> 00:53:29,540
Bomani news going on this week in the DDR world right now. We actually had Song Pack

557
00:53:29,540 --> 00:53:39,480
8 finally made its way out, and this literally came the day after we had the Song Packs be

558
00:53:39,480 --> 00:53:44,120
made available in Canada, and I believe it's seven bucks, Canadian, that they wanted for

559
00:53:44,120 --> 00:53:47,480
the song packs which are five songs but this is huge news for those folks that

560
00:53:47,480 --> 00:53:50,240
live in Canada and if you live in Canada you weren't aware of this well you know

561
00:53:50,240 --> 00:53:55,840
now you can actually download all the song packs one through what eight now I

562
00:53:55,840 --> 00:53:59,360
think you can at least get one through seven I'm pretty sure you can get eight

563
00:53:59,360 --> 00:54:05,340
at this point now so anyway um definitely check that out if you're in

564
00:54:05,340 --> 00:54:09,680
Canada and you've been wanting to get those it's definitely worth it but for

565
00:54:09,680 --> 00:54:16,280
For us here in America, we've just been waiting and waiting and waiting for Song Pack 8 to

566
00:54:16,280 --> 00:54:21,800
come out, because it has some new songs that are new to DDR and haven't been in DDR before,

567
00:54:21,800 --> 00:54:28,540
such as Cosmic Cowgirl, that song from DDR Free, er, Guitar Freaks, not DDR Freak, that's

568
00:54:28,540 --> 00:54:29,540
a different thing.

569
00:54:29,540 --> 00:54:32,140
Which is a whole ton of fun to play on Drummania.

570
00:54:32,140 --> 00:54:33,140
Yes it is.

571
00:54:33,140 --> 00:54:35,100
And you know what's funny about the steps to Cosmic Cowgirl?

572
00:54:35,100 --> 00:54:38,300
It is very similar to kind of how you play it on basic

573
00:54:38,300 --> 00:54:41,460
on the guitar so I thought that was kind of funny.

574
00:54:41,460 --> 00:54:44,500
And then, let's see, what else is there?

575
00:54:44,500 --> 00:54:48,620
Bailalakia, Carried with the Wind

576
00:54:48,620 --> 00:54:52,820
was another one. And then we have, that's also from Guitar Freaks and it's

577
00:54:52,820 --> 00:54:53,580
kind of a very

578
00:54:53,580 --> 00:54:56,620
poppish sort of song, like one of those lute songs.

579
00:54:56,620 --> 00:55:00,420
And then also Kind Lady, Interlude,

580
00:55:00,420 --> 00:55:03,860
which is cool, because Kind Lady is cool. And then we have

581
00:55:03,860 --> 00:55:07,980
more deep which is coming over from Max USA 2 or whatever

582
00:55:07,980 --> 00:55:13,820
and then we have another brand new one and it's a remix of in my eyes and it's

583
00:55:13,820 --> 00:55:15,980
done by the folks in the band neuropa

584
00:55:15,980 --> 00:55:19,140
who did the song standing still in time for Ultramix 2

585
00:55:19,140 --> 00:55:22,940
and so we're gonna do we're gonna go ahead and play that for you guys cuz we

586
00:55:22,940 --> 00:55:24,940
know not all you guys have an Xbox out there

587
00:55:24,940 --> 00:55:27,600
you probably want to check out the song maybe you're thinking about buying the

588
00:55:27,600 --> 00:55:28,080
pack

589
00:55:28,080 --> 00:55:31,940
here it is a remix of in my eyes it's the neuropa mix

590
00:55:31,940 --> 00:55:38,940
premiere here on Orange Lounge Radio. Enjoy!

591
00:56:01,940 --> 00:56:06,940
You like to make me feel

592
00:56:10,940 --> 00:56:14,940
You like to make me feel

593
00:56:16,940 --> 00:56:22,940
That you don't need to feel

594
00:56:23,940 --> 00:56:27,940
You like to make me feel

595
00:56:27,940 --> 00:56:33,940
I will never be cringy

596
00:56:37,940 --> 00:56:43,940
If I'm dead, then I'm gonna die

597
00:56:44,940 --> 00:56:48,940
If I'm dead, then I'm gonna die

598
00:57:18,940 --> 00:57:33,820
Alright, that was a premiere here of In My Eyes, the Naropa Mix.

599
00:57:33,820 --> 00:57:35,820
That being said, what did y'all think?

600
00:57:35,820 --> 00:57:41,660
DarkSagra, I know you have an opinion.

601
00:57:41,660 --> 00:57:46,380
It starts with an A, and it ends with an S, and it spells ass!

602
00:57:46,380 --> 00:57:51,700
another one of those I've made this argument before where they tried too

603
00:57:51,700 --> 00:57:57,380
hard to put too much in it and do too many things at once no the only ever

604
00:57:57,380 --> 00:58:02,680
good mix that I've heard that was not the original was the midi head one yeah

605
00:58:02,680 --> 00:58:06,060
I agree the midi head one is superior. Which was also good because there wasn't any man

606
00:58:06,060 --> 00:58:07,060
I'm singing.

607
00:58:36,060 --> 00:58:39,700
on it is that I think it's not it's too much there's too many things going on

608
00:58:39,700 --> 00:58:42,820
there's part of it well I guess it was a mix but I'd recognize part of it from

609
00:58:42,820 --> 00:58:45,860
something that I totally didn't expect it to be from and I'll be thinking hey I

610
00:58:45,860 --> 00:58:51,460
like that but I don't like it here and and I feel bad because I really like

611
00:58:51,460 --> 00:58:55,660
Naropa and I really really really like their other song and Ultramix too I

612
00:58:55,660 --> 00:59:00,980
think it's awesome but I just don't know where that mix came from honestly

613
00:59:00,980 --> 00:59:06,580
Do the chatroom who just took a shot at the Sega Master System sucks.

614
00:59:06,580 --> 00:59:14,980
Back on track, back on track, hold on, we can hate on people who hate Sega later.

615
00:59:14,980 --> 00:59:20,020
But the remix itself is just, it's so busy and there's so much going on, I just, I don't

616
00:59:20,020 --> 00:59:24,300
know, the MIDI head one I thought was way better, that one, I hate to say it, I don't

617
00:59:24,300 --> 00:59:25,300
really care for it.

618
00:59:25,300 --> 00:59:29,740
But the weird thing about it is, is that when you actually play it in the game, the steps

619
00:59:29,740 --> 00:59:33,980
I actually like a whole lot which is kinda weird because

620
00:59:33,980 --> 00:59:38,860
the steps are kinda odd and they don't really go with the beat at all but I

621
00:59:38,860 --> 00:59:41,460
think that's the reason why I like it so much is because it's very

622
00:59:41,460 --> 00:59:44,620
different like they're different and you think there's only so many different

623
00:59:44,620 --> 00:59:46,580
patterns you can do with four arrows

624
00:59:46,580 --> 00:59:50,300
and everything you can do, everything that can be done has been done

625
00:59:50,300 --> 00:59:54,260
but I think that the steps to the song when I played it, it was the first song I

626
00:59:54,260 --> 00:59:56,780
played in a long long time where I went huh

627
00:59:56,780 --> 01:00:00,940
these steps are kinda unique I like it so for that reason it kinda made it a

628
01:00:00,940 --> 01:00:03,100
fun one to dance to but the song itself

629
01:00:03,100 --> 01:00:07,540
I'd like could I take those steps to put them on a different song and

630
01:00:07,540 --> 01:00:10,940
I'd be much happier because that song doesn't really do it for me

631
01:00:10,940 --> 01:00:15,820
I can't really see getting down to that so well maybe you guys have a different

632
01:00:15,820 --> 01:00:18,780
thought we will open up the Skype line later if you guys have a thought on that

you can learn all sorts of detail about the Skype line. Alright speaking of the

636
01:00:34,420 --> 01:00:38,300
Skype line, we're gonna go to the Skype line pretty quick and we're going to

637
01:00:38,300 --> 01:00:42,420
talk to one of our buddies on the Skype line who sent us some news this week on

638
01:00:42,420 --> 01:00:46,700
Gitadora, the brand new incarnation of Gitadora. It's gonna be a little

639
01:00:46,700 --> 01:00:51,020
different so let's see if we can get him on the Skype line. I just sent him a

640
01:00:51,020 --> 01:00:55,380
message that says we're calling so hopefully he's there and hopefully we

641
01:00:55,380 --> 01:01:01,380
don't have lag issues or any of that stuff going on so we'll find out and

642
01:01:01,380 --> 01:01:09,900
we're gonna talk about guitar freaks and drum mania V like the song V like peace

643
01:01:09,900 --> 01:01:14,620
and now it doesn't want to call that's very odd oh it's just saying connecting

644
01:01:14,620 --> 01:01:21,220
dot the dot connecting oh no and it says user not online what happened

645
01:01:21,220 --> 01:01:31,540
Alright fine, what we'll do is we'll go here, we're gonna go to the list.

646
01:01:31,540 --> 01:01:35,340
I'm actually very excited to be seeing at least some type of new

647
01:01:35,340 --> 01:01:39,920
incarnation of Guitar Freaks and Drummania, because it seems like that series was getting

648
01:01:39,920 --> 01:01:40,920
very stale.

649
01:01:40,920 --> 01:01:44,900
It was kinda like, oh, here comes 9th mix, oh, here comes 10th mix, oh, here

650
01:01:44,900 --> 01:01:45,900
comes 11th mix.

651
01:01:45,900 --> 01:01:47,520
This is the same thing over and over.

652
01:01:47,520 --> 01:01:52,440
now it sounds like that there's actually something new to expect out of this

653
01:01:52,440 --> 01:01:56,080
guitar freaks and guys just you know the skyline isn't open for general calls

654
01:01:56,080 --> 01:02:00,480
just yet but we'll be taking those calls a little bit later so don't get too

655
01:02:00,480 --> 01:02:09,200
impatient we will get those calls later but first I want to talk about this so

656
01:02:09,200 --> 01:02:16,240
what's going on right now with this is I guess it's location testing right now or

657
01:02:16,240 --> 01:02:19,780
something weird's going on right now but we have a little bit of a song list we

658
01:02:19,780 --> 01:02:23,380
have some song lists going on right now and we're gonna post this a little later

659
01:02:23,380 --> 01:02:28,240
a romanized song list thank you very much to Dark LionXVI gave us a romanized

660
01:02:28,240 --> 01:02:32,100
song list of Guitar Freaks and Drum Mania V and we're gonna post that on our

661
01:02:32,100 --> 01:02:36,620
website a little later the romanized list but let's see let me point out some

662
01:02:36,620 --> 01:02:40,580
highlights through the list here a brand new Thomas Howard Lichtenstein song

663
01:02:40,580 --> 01:02:46,020
You'll Be a Man this is what they call it there's a band called Pooh and they

664
01:02:46,020 --> 01:02:51,300
have a song called Mushroom Boy. Best Name Ever. Desrow featuring Shige with

665
01:02:51,300 --> 01:02:57,540
Endless Cruising and Brad Holmes After a Hard Day and then we have some licensed

666
01:02:57,540 --> 01:03:04,880
songs they're actually covers by various folks but we have Sakonabo by Otsuka Ai

667
01:03:04,880 --> 01:03:11,340
and then we have Friends by Rebecca, NGS by Asian Kung Fu Generation, Nocturne

668
01:03:11,340 --> 01:03:20,180
number nine by Hotei Tomoyasu, Wild Challenger by Jindoo, and this is this

669
01:03:20,180 --> 01:03:25,220
is the best right here in my opinion, Misery Loo by the Spaghetti Surfers. You

670
01:03:25,220 --> 01:03:28,940
remember Misery Loo? Misery Loo was a song from Pulp Fiction.

671
01:03:28,940 --> 01:03:37,340
That song was awesome. And then there's gonna be some licensed

672
01:03:37,340 --> 01:03:43,260
songs as performed by the original musician that go on in this as well and

673
01:03:43,260 --> 01:03:50,860
let's see we're gonna try getting our buddy back on the line here again I'm

674
01:03:50,860 --> 01:03:55,900
gonna tell him to call us hopefully something weird's going on there

675
01:03:58,540 --> 01:04:03,540
and we have some licensed songs is being performed by the original artists and

676
01:04:03,540 --> 01:04:07,860
and what I thought was interesting about this is that there's a Vanilla Ninja song

677
01:04:07,860 --> 01:04:11,780
in there and you know Vanilla Ninja was a girl group that did Tough Enough

678
01:04:11,780 --> 01:04:15,900
in Ultra Mix 2. Vanilla Ninja is on the list and they are doing

679
01:04:15,900 --> 01:04:20,860
the song Liar, which I think is very interesting. Oh there's our buddy.

680
01:04:20,860 --> 01:04:23,860
Hi, Siggy.

681
01:04:23,860 --> 01:04:27,020
Hey Skye, Siggy here. Finally, we got you on the line.

682
01:04:27,020 --> 01:04:31,420
I don't know what the heck happened. Skye's acting funny tonight, I don't know what's going on.

683
01:04:31,420 --> 01:04:35,340
okay so we've been talking a little bit about guitar freaks, drum mania, V

684
01:04:35,340 --> 01:04:39,100
we were talking about the original songs, the licensed cover songs, I was just getting

685
01:04:39,100 --> 01:04:41,500
into the licensed songs performed by the original artists

686
01:04:41,500 --> 01:04:45,340
and I was kind of going vanilla ninja WTF

687
01:04:45,340 --> 01:04:49,140
exclamation exclamation, they're the girly band from

688
01:04:49,140 --> 01:04:53,340
Ultramix 2, what the hell are they doing here? Any thoughts?

689
01:04:53,340 --> 01:04:57,260
I don't know, I've never heard of Vanilla Ninja. Vanilla Ninja's the group that did

690
01:04:57,260 --> 01:04:58,060
Tough Enough

691
01:04:58,060 --> 01:05:03,900
in Ultramix 2 and it's also in the group. I'm not going to do a DDR Ultramix and stuff.

692
01:05:03,900 --> 01:05:07,620
Do you do the in the groove thing at all? Oh, I never, never.

693
01:05:07,620 --> 01:05:10,620
I never go for in the groove. Alright, well that's fine. That's my thing.

694
01:05:10,620 --> 01:05:14,860
Well, I'd play a little clip but I just don't feel like it right now.

695
01:05:14,860 --> 01:05:19,020
Tell me about some of the other stuff we can expect with

696
01:05:19,020 --> 01:05:20,500
Guitar Freaks and Drummania V.

697
01:05:20,500 --> 01:05:23,780
Stuff you've heard about. Well, not

698
01:05:23,780 --> 01:05:27,420
not really much to expect but on the official website of

699
01:05:27,420 --> 01:05:36,420
GITADORA-V right now. The GITADORA team is apologizing because they did not include the hidden option.

700
01:05:36,420 --> 01:05:38,420
Weird.

701
01:05:38,420 --> 01:05:39,420
The hidden option.

702
01:05:39,420 --> 01:05:42,420
Isn't this game location testing right now or did it actually...

703
01:05:42,420 --> 01:05:44,420
They're already actually playing right now.

704
01:05:44,420 --> 01:05:46,420
Oh wow. Interesting.

705
01:05:46,420 --> 01:05:50,420
Yeah, the official website of GITADORA-V is open.

706
01:05:50,420 --> 01:05:56,420
But sometimes those websites just go up when they're location testing. Is this game actually out and about now?

707
01:05:56,420 --> 01:06:01,420
There wasn't anything said about the locations yet, so that means that they're already playing.

708
01:06:01,420 --> 01:06:02,420
Oh wow!

709
01:06:02,420 --> 01:06:03,420
And!

710
01:06:03,420 --> 01:06:04,420
Abedand!

711
01:06:04,420 --> 01:06:10,060
Alright, so you wanted to introduce a little song here, something that we can actually

712
01:06:10,060 --> 01:06:12,420
expect to hear in Guitar Freak's Drummy and Ivy, yes?

713
01:06:12,420 --> 01:06:17,260
Yup, it is the exact licensed song performed by the original artist.

714
01:06:17,260 --> 01:06:18,260
Very cool.

715
01:06:18,260 --> 01:06:20,420
So, uh, Bimani Metalheads, rejoice!

716
01:06:20,420 --> 01:06:22,940
Oh, is this a metal song we're gonna get to hear?

717
01:06:22,940 --> 01:06:24,420
Yup, it is a metal song.

718
01:06:24,420 --> 01:06:25,420
Oh boy.

719
01:06:25,420 --> 01:06:28,420
Okay, so you want to introduce this for us?

720
01:06:28,420 --> 01:06:34,420
So I'll introduce the song. Here it is, the Dillinger Escape Plan with Panasonic Youth.

721
01:06:58,420 --> 01:07:01,420
I haven't done it in time

722
01:07:01,420 --> 01:07:05,920
Now, now, for the product

723
01:07:05,920 --> 01:07:07,420
What's the verdict?

724
01:07:07,420 --> 01:07:10,920
Can't have us getting to know

725
01:07:10,920 --> 01:07:13,920
You're so cold on the sky

726
01:07:13,920 --> 01:07:16,920
That's not what I'm doing

727
01:07:16,920 --> 01:07:19,920
For the last time

728
01:07:19,920 --> 01:07:23,420
So this is what I want

729
01:07:23,420 --> 01:07:25,920
We've come to an understanding

730
01:07:25,920 --> 01:07:28,920
You and I profit

731
01:07:29,920 --> 01:07:32,920
Roll on through to the race of secrets

732
01:07:32,920 --> 01:07:35,920
No more excuses

733
01:07:35,920 --> 01:08:00,720
Now our number's up, let's dance, lead up by the front

734
01:08:00,720 --> 01:08:11,720
I'll cut my own world around both sides, TIGERS!

735
01:08:11,720 --> 01:08:15,720
Will you do it without your statement?

736
01:08:15,720 --> 01:08:20,720
The other side is messed right side up

737
01:08:20,720 --> 01:08:25,720
And over time we try to tear the streets down

738
01:08:25,720 --> 01:08:33,720
We're getting all the power for the quick The paragraph that's never been so hectic

739
01:08:38,720 --> 01:08:40,720
The life that's kept firm

740
01:08:43,720 --> 01:08:45,720
The mother's address

741
01:08:45,720 --> 01:08:47,720
It's hand in hand

742
01:08:47,720 --> 01:08:49,720
The life that's kept firm

743
01:08:49,720 --> 01:08:51,720
Look what she's done

744
01:08:51,720 --> 01:08:55,220
Revolution! Give us a call, there's no way!

745
01:08:55,220 --> 01:08:59,720
Watch it now! Revolution! Give us a call, there's no way!

746
01:08:59,720 --> 01:09:09,280
Certainly a diverse reaction to that song in the chat room and hold on a

747
01:09:09,280 --> 01:09:15,400
minute cuz my head's still ringing a little bit there. Wow. This reminds me of all of the

748
01:09:15,400 --> 01:09:19,440
nights when after watching Saturday Night Live I would tune in for Headbanger's

749
01:09:19,440 --> 01:09:27,920
Ball. I have to sum that up with this is the perfect summation of that song in

750
01:09:27,920 --> 01:09:37,560
the chat right now from SSJ 100 Matt awesomely crappy you know what okay I

751
01:09:37,560 --> 01:09:42,200
guess the metalhead folks because some folks in the chat room are just cheering

752
01:09:42,200 --> 01:09:45,800
at this and some people are just absolutely saying I don't even want to

753
01:09:45,800 --> 01:09:52,320
play guitar freaks Drummania V right now if this song's on it but some folks are

754
01:09:52,320 --> 01:09:57,600
just saying this is awesome so certainly a diverse selection of music to be in

755
01:09:57,600 --> 01:10:00,680
in the next uh... guitar freaks to our media integration

756
01:10:00,680 --> 01:10:03,680
i totally play that song that's just great

757
01:10:03,680 --> 01:10:08,240
set my hand on her like a bitch but i'd play that song i would play that song

758
01:10:08,240 --> 01:10:12,360
you get the whaling bonus for like whacking the guitar against the machine when you're done

759
01:10:12,360 --> 01:10:16,080
that's the kind of song where i would wail and then swing the guitar around and smack

760
01:10:16,080 --> 01:10:19,600
a roseville golf land child in the face

761
01:10:19,600 --> 01:10:20,600
in front of his mother

762
01:10:20,600 --> 01:10:33,040
Can you imagine the drum mania part of that song?

763
01:10:33,040 --> 01:10:42,560
That's not going to be an easy song, whatever that is, that's very interesting.

764
01:10:42,560 --> 01:10:45,680
Some folks in the chat room are saying, here are the lyrics to that song, and then just

765
01:10:45,680 --> 01:10:49,200
banging on the keyboard, because you really can't understand.

766
01:10:49,200 --> 01:10:50,460
Let me take a little clip.

767
01:10:50,460 --> 01:10:53,500
Siggy, help me understand here, because you seem to be in the middle.

768
01:10:53,500 --> 01:10:55,380
Help me understand what they're saying in this song.

769
01:10:55,380 --> 01:11:05,500
Let me get you to the part where they're actually singing.

770
01:11:05,500 --> 01:11:08,640
Sounds like...

771
01:11:08,640 --> 01:11:11,380
Lords of Dishwasher Scabies, is what I heard.

772
01:11:11,380 --> 01:11:12,380
I don't...

773
01:11:12,380 --> 01:11:17,860
Honestly, I don't really, I haven't gotten, I haven't checked out the lyrics to Panasonic

774
01:11:17,860 --> 01:11:25,160
use yet. Okay. So this is a thrash metal. So yeah, it's kind of really hard to understand.

775
01:11:25,160 --> 01:11:34,660
It certainly does make me want to break things. Seriously. Alright, well, it's certainly a

776
01:11:34,660 --> 01:11:39,140
sign of diversity to come in the next Guitar Freeze. Any other news on this new mix you

777
01:11:39,140 --> 01:11:43,900
want to share with us? Well, let me just help you out pronouncing the songs right. Please

778
01:11:43,900 --> 01:11:49,260
do because I have issues apparently yeah um this uh the carried by the wind sound

779
01:11:49,260 --> 01:11:54,940
it's actually pronounced balalaika ah okay well yeah I needed help with that

780
01:11:54,940 --> 01:11:59,660
balalaika okay I'll forget that but thanks for trying and then I'm gonna

781
01:11:59,660 --> 01:12:04,100
mention some songs like an extra stage ancient breeze by uh oh no he day you key

782
01:12:04,100 --> 01:12:10,580
and the white tornado by trick trap so wait there's two extra stages right you

783
01:12:10,580 --> 01:12:14,420
get to pick. Yeah, he gets to pick. Because usually, like in the older guitar freaks,

784
01:12:14,420 --> 01:12:17,440
you don't get to pick. But I noticed, I think in the newer one, like some of the

785
01:12:17,440 --> 01:12:21,660
newer ones, you got, you get to start picking a little later on. I just remember, what was it,

786
01:12:21,660 --> 01:12:31,500
fifth note was fourth mix with, uh, we have screensaver, um, with, uh, Carnival Day. And going,

787
01:12:31,500 --> 01:12:35,260
what the hell song is this? Because it kicked my ass the first time around. I

788
01:12:35,260 --> 01:12:39,740
I remember fireball. Fireballs! From like six and fifth.

789
01:12:39,740 --> 01:12:44,140
But now I can beat carnival to easy. All the songs now are a lot harder than

790
01:12:44,140 --> 01:12:48,060
they used to be. Yeah on the Gita Dora V there are two

791
01:12:48,060 --> 01:12:52,220
special stages, which is encore uh fairy tales by uh

792
01:12:52,220 --> 01:12:55,660
Izumi Mutsuishiko and the premium encore stage. Here's a

793
01:12:55,660 --> 01:12:59,340
little bit interesting. The Zabu Fluta by Wanyan Panic. Now the

794
01:12:59,340 --> 01:13:04,940
song the Zabu Fluta is a is a Mozart song. Hmm.

795
01:13:04,940 --> 01:13:09,940
But I'm sure they've made it very difficult to play and rock out because it's a premium encore.

796
01:13:09,940 --> 01:13:13,940
Any idea what the differences are between an encore and a premium encore at this point?

797
01:13:13,940 --> 01:13:18,940
Well, it's kind of like a GITADORA 10-9.

798
01:13:18,940 --> 01:13:28,940
Like, you know, if you have a double S on an extra stage, you get to access premium encore stage, which was a timepiece bass 2.

799
01:13:28,940 --> 01:13:30,940
Right. Okay.

800
01:13:30,940 --> 01:13:42,940
If you don't get, you know, if you don't get it, if you got an S, you get to access on score stage, which is, you know, which is a model DD5 on GITADORA 9. It's kind of like that.

801
01:13:42,940 --> 01:13:46,940
Okay, okay. That makes sense. Sounds cool. Loki, you had a comment? You want to say something?

802
01:13:46,940 --> 01:13:47,940
No.

803
01:13:47,940 --> 01:13:50,940
Oh, I thought you did. You were, like, reaching for the mic, I thought.

804
01:13:50,940 --> 01:13:51,940
Fine.

805
01:13:51,940 --> 01:13:57,940
Alright, any other comments you want to tell us about GITADORA V until we start seeing some machines here in the States and we start getting some news around here?

806
01:13:57,940 --> 01:14:04,940
There are revival songs. I'm not sure whether it's going to be an E-Amusement access or not.

807
01:14:04,940 --> 01:14:07,940
But here are the songs that are going to be rev- that are revived.

808
01:14:07,940 --> 01:14:19,940
Model DD2, Herring Row, Staff, Smile For You, High, Sweet Illusion, Po-Pouris d'Orange, Heaven Inside, and depend on the long version.

809
01:14:19,940 --> 01:14:23,940
Come on, everybody knows that song is Po-Pouris d'Orange. Come on.

810
01:14:23,940 --> 01:14:25,940
It's potpourri de orange!

811
01:14:25,940 --> 01:14:27,940
It's pauperie de orange!

812
01:14:29,940 --> 01:14:31,940
But I hate the French!

813
01:14:31,940 --> 01:14:33,940
I'm kidding. I'm kidding.

814
01:14:33,940 --> 01:14:35,940
Everybody knows that song.

815
01:14:35,940 --> 01:14:37,940
It's potpourri de orange.

816
01:14:37,940 --> 01:14:39,940
Don't give me that de orange stuff.

817
01:14:39,940 --> 01:14:41,940
It's de orange.

818
01:14:41,940 --> 01:14:43,940
It's much better when you pronounce it in France, monsieur.

819
01:14:43,940 --> 01:14:45,940
Just like you're listening to de orange lounge radio.

820
01:14:45,940 --> 01:14:47,940
It's de orange.

821
01:14:47,940 --> 01:14:49,940
It's not de orange lounge radio.

822
01:14:49,940 --> 01:14:55,940
And yeah, and the other Orange Lawn song is pronounced Plutori de Marmalade.

823
01:14:55,940 --> 01:14:59,940
Okay, well now I've heard Marmalade, but that's only because I know the song.

824
01:14:59,940 --> 01:15:02,940
Creole Lady Marmalade.

825
01:15:06,940 --> 01:15:11,940
Alright, Siggy, thanks for the updates on Gita Dora V. We appreciate it.

826
01:15:11,940 --> 01:15:14,940
Even if that song gave us all a headache, we do appreciate it.

827
01:15:14,940 --> 01:15:16,940
Alright, have a good one, buddy.

828
01:15:16,940 --> 01:15:17,940
Alright, later.

829
01:15:17,940 --> 01:15:18,940
Later!

830
01:15:18,940 --> 01:15:23,380
always helping us out there. Helping me out with my pronunciation because I have

831
01:15:23,380 --> 01:15:24,740
issues pronouncing things.

832
01:15:24,740 --> 01:15:28,780
Because I've given up.

833
01:15:28,780 --> 01:15:33,300
You know what, at some point we're going to roll you over here to this

834
01:15:33,300 --> 01:15:36,580
screen so you can see this list and you're going to start reading all this

835
01:15:36,580 --> 01:15:38,140
stuff so they can make fun of me.

836
01:15:38,140 --> 01:15:41,500
Okay. Okay. Or they can make fun of you instead of me.

837
01:15:41,500 --> 01:15:44,780
I found the lyrics. You found the lyrics?

838
01:15:44,780 --> 01:15:48,060
Okay, these are the lyrics to that song.

839
01:15:48,060 --> 01:15:52,820
I'm going to give you a little taste of the lyrics.

840
01:15:52,820 --> 01:15:55,820
Should I do it in their style?

841
01:15:55,820 --> 01:16:03,420
We wrote these plans, took the order, the architecture, and followed them to the end

842
01:16:03,420 --> 01:16:06,440
until the gears ground cold and relentless.

843
01:16:06,440 --> 01:16:10,740
There was no remorse, we had none, we kept on with no trace of a regret.

844
01:16:10,740 --> 01:16:15,740
I never saw any blood, no soul for the body, watched them turn, her scab-covered skin...

845
01:16:15,740 --> 01:16:19,940
Hey, that's the part that I thought was Dishwasher Scabies, because it's scared.

846
01:16:19,940 --> 01:16:24,460
Her scab-covered skin into a stone like a coal in the sky, searching for the dawn for

847
01:16:24,460 --> 01:16:29,180
the last time, bloated with wide eyes wide, we've come to an understanding.

848
01:16:29,180 --> 01:16:32,580
You lose, I profit, high noon, and there ain't no secrets no more.

849
01:16:32,580 --> 01:16:34,020
The song is called what?

850
01:16:34,020 --> 01:16:36,140
Well, I'm not going to read the whole damn song.

851
01:16:36,140 --> 01:16:37,140
And it's one giant run-on.

852
01:16:37,140 --> 01:16:42,140
Yeah, the whole thing is one giant run-on sentence, which is not much of a surprise.

853
01:16:42,140 --> 01:16:44,140
What's the song called again?

854
01:16:44,140 --> 01:16:46,140
It's called Panasonic Youth.

855
01:16:46,140 --> 01:16:52,140
I thought it was going to be about, like, VCRs and TVs and the 3DO.

856
01:16:52,140 --> 01:16:59,140
When I first read it, I only heard, I don't know, somehow my eyes only caught the Sonic Youth part.

857
01:16:59,140 --> 01:17:03,140
And I was like, cool, we're getting a Sonic Youth song in Guitar Freaks.

858
01:17:03,140 --> 01:17:06,140
And then I was disappointed.

859
01:17:06,140 --> 01:17:11,360
especially once you heard it. There is a Sonic Youth song that I would want in

860
01:17:11,360 --> 01:17:16,020
Guitar Freaks and that's a hundred percent. I want way more songs in Guitar

861
01:17:16,020 --> 01:17:21,900
Freaks and more home versions. We definitely need more home versions. Amen. I need to put my

862
01:17:21,900 --> 01:17:26,320
drum mania controller to use. Dude, I've been session-moding it like all the

863
01:17:26,320 --> 01:17:30,820
time. You just won't come down and play. Alright. If you can hear the breathing in the

864
01:17:30,820 --> 01:17:34,300
background that's because we did pick up the skype line. Even though I didn't say

865
01:17:34,300 --> 01:17:38,000
It was open and hell people were calling in anyway. Ah hell. Let's take a call

866
01:17:38,680 --> 01:17:45,840
You're on Orange Lounge radio who dis this is Elle mullet. Hello Elle mullet. How you doing? I'm doing good sky

867
01:17:45,840 --> 01:17:52,400
How about yourself? I'm okay. I'm trying to get over the dishwashers dishwater scabies song, but otherwise I'm doing okay

868
01:17:53,480 --> 01:17:55,120
What's on your mind?

869
01:17:55,120 --> 01:17:58,740
Well, I have recently taken the plunge into 2dx

870
01:17:58,740 --> 01:18:04,740
Congratulations! How does one take the plunge, so to speak, in 2DX?

871
01:18:04,740 --> 01:18:08,740
Well, you spent $250 on games in the controller.

872
01:18:08,740 --> 01:18:09,740
That's quite a plunge.

873
01:18:09,740 --> 01:18:10,740
Been there.

874
01:18:10,740 --> 01:18:12,740
Been there, done that, yes.

875
01:18:12,740 --> 01:18:15,740
And so how are you enjoying the water now that you've taken the plunge?

876
01:18:15,740 --> 01:18:18,740
I am enjoying the water very much.

877
01:18:18,740 --> 01:18:21,740
The water kicks my ass, but I'm enjoying it.

878
01:18:21,740 --> 01:18:25,740
It's poisonous water. It feels cold and prickly.

879
01:18:25,740 --> 01:18:31,740
How is it going for you? How are you warming up into the game?

880
01:18:31,740 --> 01:18:36,740
Did you jump right into hard stuff, or did you just start on beginner mode or drill mode?

881
01:18:36,740 --> 01:18:38,740
How are you getting into this game?

882
01:18:38,740 --> 01:18:43,740
Well, I wanted to start on Light 7, but I was forced into beginner mode because, well,

883
01:18:43,740 --> 01:18:48,740
two stars on Light 7 kicked my ass, and that couldn't have been right.

884
01:18:48,740 --> 01:18:53,740
It's tough. It's a tough game. Have you ever played the arcade version at all?

885
01:18:53,740 --> 01:18:58,300
Actually, I have a total of two times. Once in

886
01:18:58,300 --> 01:19:02,820
03 when I went to Vegas and once in 04 when the machine in Vegas moved to a

887
01:19:02,820 --> 01:19:03,660
different place.

888
01:19:03,660 --> 01:19:07,060
So you at least had some idea of what to expect?

889
01:19:07,060 --> 01:19:11,180
Pretty much. I mean I had like more

890
01:19:11,180 --> 01:19:16,100
experience in the original Beatmania, actually.

891
01:19:16,100 --> 01:19:19,740
I played it a few more times. Okay, right on.

892
01:19:19,740 --> 01:19:25,860
So now usually there's that big question that always goes around out there is that, you

893
01:19:25,860 --> 01:19:29,820
know, I'm new to 2DX, what style should I buy?

894
01:19:29,820 --> 01:19:31,620
So what styles did you end up buying?

895
01:19:31,620 --> 01:19:37,860
I ended up getting 7th and 8th style being as they are the most current ones.

896
01:19:37,860 --> 01:19:42,820
So far I like 7th style the best because it has the more fleshed out beginner's mode and

897
01:19:42,820 --> 01:19:45,940
it has more of the songs that I like.

898
01:19:45,940 --> 01:19:49,180
Interesting because I kind of preferred 8th style when I played them both.

899
01:19:49,180 --> 01:19:53,180
Yeah, it's kind of interesting, but okay, alright. Well of course, but we have a different perspective.

900
01:19:53,180 --> 01:19:55,180
You know, we're not new.

901
01:19:55,180 --> 01:19:58,180
I spent three hours playing 8th style one night.

902
01:19:58,180 --> 01:19:59,180
That's pretty hot.

903
01:19:59,180 --> 01:20:00,180
On New Year's Eve.

904
01:20:00,180 --> 01:20:01,180
Which one has burning heat?

905
01:20:01,180 --> 01:20:02,180
7th.

906
01:20:02,180 --> 01:20:04,180
7th, yes.

907
01:20:04,180 --> 01:20:07,180
And 7th style rocks.

908
01:20:07,180 --> 01:20:13,180
It's not that I don't like 8th style, it's that 7th style is much better for me to get into.

909
01:20:13,180 --> 01:20:20,540
too. I can play more songs on beginner. It's much easier for me to go through. Then I go

910
01:20:20,540 --> 01:20:25,060
to 8th style, play a few songs, and go back to 7th style and cower in the corner of beginners

911
01:20:25,060 --> 01:20:26,060
mode again.

912
01:20:26,060 --> 01:20:33,540
There you go. So, is your goal to become a 2DX master? Are you going to pick up the other

913
01:20:33,540 --> 01:20:38,140
styles at some point, or do you think this is going to be it for you, or what's going

914
01:20:38,140 --> 01:20:39,220
on?

915
01:20:39,220 --> 01:20:46,180
I'm looking into purchasing 9th Style eventually when it comes out but I'm leaning toward waiting

916
01:20:46,180 --> 01:20:48,500
for it rather than pre-ordering for it.

917
01:20:48,500 --> 01:20:53,060
I'd rather get good on the two games that I have before jumping into a third one and

918
01:20:53,060 --> 01:20:55,460
spreading myself even further.

919
01:20:55,460 --> 01:21:02,060
See the interesting thing about my 2DX life or whatever is that the two styles that I

920
01:21:02,060 --> 01:21:04,860
don't own are 7th and 8th.

921
01:21:04,860 --> 01:21:07,740
I just now that ninth is coming out though. Oh my god

922
01:21:07,740 --> 01:21:13,220
I love night style song list so much that I'm gonna have to get myself back into 2dx like it or not

923
01:21:13,220 --> 01:21:18,000
But my controller sucks and that's the one thing that's holding me back from playing a lot of 2dx

924
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:23,100
I don't get is why my controller which is what a good two years older than yours. Mm-hmm

925
01:21:23,100 --> 01:21:27,980
It's still in perfect condition. Mine took a lot of abuse, especially when I fell off of the van

926
01:21:28,620 --> 01:21:29,980
I then I don't know

927
01:21:29,980 --> 01:21:32,020
I really don't know what to tell you on that one

928
01:21:32,020 --> 01:21:36,660
I'd like to tell that story, but we don't have that kind of time. Well, actually we do have quite a bit of time

929
01:21:37,420 --> 01:21:42,540
Told her don't take the fucking controller. You're not going to use it. We're going to a convention

930
01:21:42,540 --> 01:21:46,500
We're gonna have other things to do. She's like no no, no, no, I gotta take it. It's brand new

931
01:21:46,500 --> 01:21:50,860
I mean, we just got it beautiful shape. I said no, it's gonna get abused

932
01:21:50,860 --> 01:21:52,860
You're gonna throw on the back of the van something's gonna happen

933
01:21:52,860 --> 01:21:54,860
We get there we pull the parking garage

934
01:21:54,860 --> 01:21:56,940
We pop open the back of the van.

935
01:21:56,940 --> 01:21:59,700
The controller doesn't just fall out.

936
01:21:59,700 --> 01:22:06,660
It like gets propelled out, flies across the parking garage, and just clatters to the pavement.

937
01:22:06,660 --> 01:22:12,980
Jamie's got a look on her face like, and I'm like, see, I fucking told you that was going

938
01:22:12,980 --> 01:22:13,980
to happen.

939
01:22:13,980 --> 01:22:15,940
And that's probably the sound she made too, huh?

940
01:22:15,940 --> 01:22:16,940
Exactly.

941
01:22:16,940 --> 01:22:17,940
I mean, she looked shocked.

942
01:22:17,940 --> 01:22:18,940
And that thing had been broken.

943
01:22:18,940 --> 01:22:24,340
I would have never ever let her forget it, but she got off lucky and it worked just fine.

944
01:22:24,340 --> 01:22:27,860
And we took it apart and gave it a little service and you know

945
01:22:27,860 --> 01:22:31,180
We didn't take it apart that day. No, we took it all apart

946
01:22:31,180 --> 01:22:36,060
We cleaned every button and it works a lot better now. We did that recently. We didn't do any of that

947
01:22:36,060 --> 01:22:37,240
No, no, we didn't do it that day

948
01:22:37,240 --> 01:22:41,940
We didn't do any of that bizarre shaving the buttons like some idiots that we know is what I refuse to

949
01:22:42,260 --> 01:22:45,120
But I didn't shave the buttons. That's why you're smart

950
01:22:47,820 --> 01:22:48,520
But you know

951
01:22:48,520 --> 01:22:51,440
I'm a mad scientist here build you a real controller take the

952
01:22:51,440 --> 01:22:53,640
to take the circuit board out of that old controller.

953
01:22:53,640 --> 01:22:54,920
Because he'll never finish it.

954
01:22:54,920 --> 01:22:57,120
He doesn't finish any of his projects.

955
01:22:57,120 --> 01:23:00,960
The only one he's ever finished is the orange Xbox thing.

956
01:23:00,960 --> 01:23:03,160
Now, now, I've finished those pads.

957
01:23:03,160 --> 01:23:03,660
Hey, look.

958
01:23:03,660 --> 01:23:04,640
The pads are done.

959
01:23:04,640 --> 01:23:06,080
And they broke after like a week.

960
01:23:06,080 --> 01:23:07,160
They did not break.

961
01:23:07,160 --> 01:23:08,560
They work perfectly fine.

962
01:23:08,560 --> 01:23:11,320
It's just they build up a lot of static electricity.

963
01:23:11,320 --> 01:23:13,640
The trick is to get it done cosmetically before you

964
01:23:13,640 --> 01:23:15,800
get it done functionally.

965
01:23:15,800 --> 01:23:17,600
Because it's like your arcade cap.

966
01:23:17,600 --> 01:23:19,280
This thing works.

967
01:23:19,280 --> 01:23:21,800
So it's like, damn, why should I work on it more?

968
01:23:21,800 --> 01:23:22,800
It works!

969
01:23:22,800 --> 01:23:24,360
It doesn't look so great.

970
01:23:24,360 --> 01:23:28,100
Alright, we've got our caller on the line, our poor caller sitting there just listening

971
01:23:28,100 --> 01:23:29,520
to us yell at each other.

972
01:23:29,520 --> 01:23:30,520
Hi.

973
01:23:30,520 --> 01:23:32,860
Hi, how you doing?

974
01:23:32,860 --> 01:23:36,200
I will get to that 7th style break at some point, because I know you wanted to hear some

975
01:23:36,200 --> 01:23:39,280
7th style music to celebrate your 2DX goodness.

976
01:23:39,280 --> 01:23:41,360
Burning heat!

977
01:23:41,360 --> 01:23:46,880
Um, anything that you think the home versions are lacking versus the arcade version, having

978
01:23:46,880 --> 01:23:49,000
played both?

979
01:23:49,000 --> 01:23:54,000
I've had such little experience with the arcade version, I wouldn't know what to say, what

980
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:59,960
to do. I can't really comment on arcade song list versus home song list because these are

981
01:23:59,960 --> 01:24:03,020
the only songs that I know right now.

982
01:24:03,020 --> 01:24:09,240
So politically correct. That's alright.

983
01:24:09,240 --> 01:24:17,240
If I could say that my controller is a little unresponsive in some portions, the turntable

984
01:24:17,240 --> 01:24:23,240
Right now is the bane of my existence. I'm so tempted to turn on auto-scratch, but then I don't learn anything.

985
01:24:23,240 --> 01:24:27,240
Out of curiosity, what kind of controller did you pick up? Did you pick up an official Konami one?

986
01:24:27,240 --> 01:24:30,240
Yes, I did. The official Konami one.

987
01:24:30,240 --> 01:24:34,240
Good for you. Those are the ones you want to get. Good job.

988
01:24:34,240 --> 01:24:41,240
Well, and just take very, very good care of it. Like, seriously, the next one I get, I'm going to put it back in the box every time I play.

989
01:24:41,240 --> 01:24:45,760
I'm going to wrap it back up so that a damn piece of dust does not get into that thing

990
01:24:45,760 --> 01:24:50,360
because I don't know how my current controller got ruined, but it's just screwed beyond belief

991
01:24:50,360 --> 01:24:52,760
and it makes me sad.

992
01:24:52,760 --> 01:24:55,960
Anything else you want to share with us today, ElMullet?

993
01:24:55,960 --> 01:24:57,120
That's pretty much it.

994
01:24:57,120 --> 01:25:02,960
I'm in 2DX and I'm not off the DDR bandwagon yet.

995
01:25:02,960 --> 01:25:04,440
Alright, sounds good.

996
01:25:04,440 --> 01:25:07,880
Good, because we don't, you know a lot of people when they go over to 2DX, they start

997
01:25:07,880 --> 01:25:11,160
adopting that DDR sucks attitude, you know what I'm saying?

998
01:25:11,160 --> 01:25:19,160
Believe it or not, I can kind of see where they're coming from because 2DX is a hell of a lot more challenging than DDR is.

999
01:25:19,160 --> 01:25:21,160
It's just, it's a different game.

1000
01:25:21,160 --> 01:25:23,160
I'm not sure I believe that.

1001
01:25:23,160 --> 01:25:26,160
It's a different game, yes it is. Comparing apples to oranges.

1002
01:25:26,160 --> 01:25:37,160
I'm not sure I believe that either because, and I know, oh god, I'm going to get shot, I'm already getting hate mail right now for that statement, but it's, I mean with DDR you're moving your whole body.

1003
01:25:37,160 --> 01:25:42,760
body. With 2DX, you're moving your fingers. Now granted, you know, it may take longer

1004
01:25:42,760 --> 01:25:47,840
to get better at this or whatever, but it's certainly a different type of challenge. Like

1005
01:25:47,840 --> 01:25:51,920
definitely one of them is challenging your physical ability, while one of them is kind

1006
01:25:51,920 --> 01:25:59,400
of challenging a little more your musical and rhythmic ability. So it's very different.

1007
01:25:59,400 --> 01:26:03,240
They both come down to smashing the right button at the right moment.

1008
01:26:03,240 --> 01:26:09,240
That's where people make the mistake. You have to go to town on DDR.

1009
01:26:09,240 --> 01:26:13,240
Where on Beatmania, I've seen this dude playing it with one hand.

1010
01:26:13,240 --> 01:26:16,240
And obviously the dude was some sort of freaky nature.

1011
01:26:16,240 --> 01:26:21,240
And it was fantastic. It can't be that much harder.

1012
01:26:21,240 --> 01:26:25,240
You see these what? What's the biggest song? Is it like a ten foot these days?

1013
01:26:25,240 --> 01:26:27,240
Oh, on DDR? Yeah, ten foot.

1014
01:26:27,240 --> 01:26:30,240
You could go over to Nucleartastic or something?

1015
01:26:30,240 --> 01:26:32,200
in the groove and they have like 13s,

1016
01:26:32,200 --> 01:26:33,920
pandemonium or something like that,

1017
01:26:33,920 --> 01:26:34,760
is like a super tough song.

1018
01:26:34,760 --> 01:26:36,320
I remember watching these people play like,

1019
01:26:36,320 --> 01:26:39,200
you know, like the eight foot songs, like in the day.

1020
01:26:39,200 --> 01:26:41,240
And I'm watching these songs, like, I don't know,

1021
01:26:41,240 --> 01:26:43,320
what was the one, Dropout or something like that.

1022
01:26:43,320 --> 01:26:44,860
And I'm watching you guys play this, I'm like,

1023
01:26:44,860 --> 01:26:48,080
oh dear God, what the hell?

1024
01:26:48,080 --> 01:26:49,900
You can't move that fast.

1025
01:26:49,900 --> 01:26:52,440
The person that does the 2DX one-handed

1026
01:26:52,440 --> 01:26:54,400
would go over to DDR and probably,

1027
01:26:54,400 --> 01:26:57,080
ah, ah, after playing a song.

1028
01:26:57,080 --> 01:26:59,940
And the person that plays DDR and plays the 14 footers

1029
01:26:59,940 --> 01:27:04,940
or whatever, would probably go over to 2DX and go TOO MANY LINES! TOO MANY LINES!

1030
01:27:04,940 --> 01:27:07,940
That's pretty much how I went into it.

1031
01:27:07,940 --> 01:27:13,940
Honestly, you want the most complicated game I've seen in that whole series. It's that frickin' poppin' music.

1032
01:27:13,940 --> 01:27:18,940
I looked at that game and I'm like, what's this like? Beatmania for retards?

1033
01:27:18,940 --> 01:27:19,940
It's so cute!

1034
01:27:19,940 --> 01:27:22,940
It's really easy with the huge buttons and everything.

1035
01:27:22,940 --> 01:27:27,940
And so Jamie throws down like one of the harder songs and I was just like, oh god!

1036
01:27:27,940 --> 01:27:28,940
This game's horrible.

1037
01:27:28,940 --> 01:27:32,380
looks can be deceiving my friend

1038
01:27:32,380 --> 01:27:36,140
you are with the cartoon bunnies that's where they get you is all about keyboard

1039
01:27:36,140 --> 01:27:41,140
maniac god bless keyboard mania rest your soul in peace i miss you

1040
01:27:41,140 --> 01:27:42,480

let's see let's go over to

1059
01:28:34,340 --> 01:28:37,500
this one hi you're on orange launch radio

1060
01:28:37,500 --> 01:28:41,540
hey what's up it's ron from new york how you guys doing good hello ron from new

1061
01:28:41,540 --> 01:28:43,460
york how you doing

1062
01:28:43,460 --> 01:28:47,300
i'm doing good i'm just glad to hear you guys after not hearing you for about three weeks

1063
01:28:47,300 --> 01:28:49,540
yeah what's up where you been

1064
01:28:49,540 --> 01:28:52,740
well my computer was down for a couple of weeks and then um...

1065
01:28:52,740 --> 01:28:54,620
my aunt made a cosplay cup

1066
01:28:54,620 --> 01:28:59,160
We were getting ready for Capticon and we were taking Sundays for rehearsals.

1067
01:28:59,160 --> 01:29:03,560
Okay, okay. Yeah, people like to use Sunday nights for other things, even

1068
01:29:03,560 --> 01:29:07,160
though they should understand that this program is on, I mean...

1069
01:29:07,160 --> 01:29:11,680
Hello. They should all be in church. Worshipping us.

1070
01:29:11,680 --> 01:29:14,720
Just kidding. This is my church right here. This is my church.

1071
01:29:14,720 --> 01:29:18,760
Church of Orange on Radio. Amen! Amen!

1072
01:29:18,760 --> 01:29:23,640
Can I get an amen? Testify my brother!

1073
01:29:23,640 --> 01:29:27,640
God, that's a scary notion. That is a scary-ass notion.

1074
01:29:27,640 --> 01:29:31,360
Don't praise us. Don't. You being the head of a church? We're just, we're just,

1075
01:29:31,360 --> 01:29:34,560
we're just big stupid kids like the rest of you. Rob, you can't,

1076
01:29:34,560 --> 01:29:38,000
you can't deny the financial opportunities

1077
01:29:38,000 --> 01:29:43,200
in being the head of a church. Plus, when you get tired of it being a church, it can, it can

1078
01:29:43,200 --> 01:29:44,200
become a cult.

1079
01:29:44,200 --> 01:29:48,280
And then you can be a cult leader. Okay, I'd be one of those churches that would be like on the

1080
01:29:48,280 --> 01:29:51,440
daily show because we have the topless preachers. I mean, that would be...

1081
01:29:51,440 --> 01:29:54,560
What church is this?

1082
01:29:54,560 --> 01:29:59,520
That's what I'm talking about. Well, if you guys were a church,

1083
01:29:59,520 --> 01:30:02,520
it'd be a tax riddle. Oh my god, he's got a point.

1084
01:30:02,520 --> 01:30:06,720
If we were a church, we could write this shit off on our taxes.

1085
01:30:06,720 --> 01:30:09,920
That's what I was telling you. You can't deny the financial opportunity.

1086
01:30:09,920 --> 01:30:13,440
Can I get an amen?

1087
01:30:13,440 --> 01:30:17,120
There's a guy I met at Coast Con eight years ago who has the Church of the Great Green Frog.

1088
01:30:17,120 --> 01:30:20,480
He did it just so he could have the tax write-off.

1089
01:30:20,480 --> 01:30:25,040
and he was going around passing get out of hell free cards

1090
01:30:25,040 --> 01:30:27,920
there is a first church of pac-man as well

1091
01:30:27,920 --> 01:30:31,520
there's also the partridge family cult

1092
01:30:31,520 --> 01:30:34,960
i can you not the partridge family cult exists that's hot

1093
01:30:34,960 --> 01:30:38,640
this guy's having problems it was it fully looked like the monopoly card

1094
01:30:38,640 --> 01:30:43,440
except it had a frog with wings wearing a tuxedo and it's and it was

1095
01:30:43,440 --> 01:30:48,960
the church of the great green frog i'm gonna see if i can if you have a website

1096
01:30:48,960 --> 01:30:52,960
Anyway, before we got off on that tangent, how was the convention that you went to?

1097
01:30:52,960 --> 01:30:59,960
It was really good. Some people complained it was in two different hotels, but I had a great time overall.

1098
01:30:59,960 --> 01:31:04,960
It was packed as hell, and it was tons of Naruto cosplayers. Gee, I wonder why.

1099
01:31:04,960 --> 01:31:07,960
Because it was Naruto-kan?

1100
01:31:07,960 --> 01:31:10,960
That, and it was licensed just that week.

1101
01:31:10,960 --> 01:31:14,960
Oh, yeah, that's right. I heard that news. Very cool.

1102
01:31:14,960 --> 01:31:34,960
Yeah. We got together for the giant photo shoot. There was about 200 of us. We're all in front of the hotel. People that want to take our pictures are going into the streets. We're telling people to drive around us. Security's coming out and telling us, oh, you gotta move, you gotta move. There's 200 of us. Where are we going to move to?

1103
01:31:34,960 --> 01:31:39,960
Were they taking pictures, like, for promotional purposes as well? Like, are you gonna be famous?

1104
01:31:39,960 --> 01:31:45,960
Nah, there was a giant Naruto cosplay photoshoot, so everybody wanted to jump in on it.

1105
01:31:45,960 --> 01:31:47,960
That's still pretty cool. Very cool.

1106
01:31:47,960 --> 01:31:50,960
Yeah, I can post links to some pictures if you'd like later.

1107
01:31:50,960 --> 01:31:53,960
Post them in the chatroom. Let our chatters check it out. Be cool.

1108
01:31:53,960 --> 01:31:54,960
Then I will in just a bit.

1109
01:31:54,960 --> 01:31:58,960
Alright, sounds good. Any video gaming going on at the convention?

1110
01:31:58,960 --> 01:32:01,960
I couldn't even make it over to the gaming section.

1111
01:32:01,960 --> 01:32:08,960
All I know is that if it was the same setup like last year, there was like maybe two...

1112
01:32:08,960 --> 01:32:12,460
There's probably one American Idol set up, two karaoke revolutions...

1113
01:32:12,460 --> 01:32:14,460
Wait, wait, wait. American Idol?

1114
01:32:14,460 --> 01:32:15,460
Yes, I'm serious.

1115
01:32:15,460 --> 01:32:17,460
At one of these conventions? What the heck? That's not...

1116
01:32:17,460 --> 01:32:19,460
That's not Japanese. What is that?

1117
01:32:19,460 --> 01:32:20,460
That's crap.

1118
01:32:20,460 --> 01:32:21,460
Well, I'm...

1119
01:32:21,460 --> 01:32:24,460
After Gwen Stefani's CD, I'm calling...

1120
01:32:24,460 --> 01:32:28,460
They're gonna try to get her to come to a con to sing any of those songs.

1121
01:32:28,460 --> 01:32:31,460
And I'm done. That's when I'll retire.

1122
01:32:31,460 --> 01:32:33,460
Wow. Wow. Okay, okay.

1123
01:32:33,460 --> 01:32:37,460
I think... You were breaking up a little bit there, but I picked up most of that, I think, about the Gwen Stefani CD

1124
01:32:37,460 --> 01:32:40,900
CD and after her latest inspirations and everything.

1125
01:32:40,900 --> 01:32:41,900
Very interesting.

1126
01:32:41,900 --> 01:32:42,900
Wow.

1127
01:32:42,900 --> 01:32:43,900
Alright.

1128
01:32:43,900 --> 01:32:49,280
Anything else you wanted to share with us tonight, when you called in?

1129
01:32:49,280 --> 01:32:51,100
The skit that we did.

1130
01:32:51,100 --> 01:32:56,220
We did Naruto to Ninja Rap, we won best technical job.

1131
01:32:56,220 --> 01:32:57,580
Best technical job.

1132
01:32:57,580 --> 01:33:01,860
What exactly is the technical component of a skit at an anime convention?

1133
01:33:01,860 --> 01:33:06,100
The fact that the tech group loved, the fact that they were able to post Go Ninja Go on

1134
01:33:06,100 --> 01:33:08,660
in the big screens while we were dancing.

1135
01:33:08,660 --> 01:33:10,260
That's very cool.

1136
01:33:10,260 --> 01:33:11,220
Yeah.

1137
01:33:11,220 --> 01:33:13,020
Very cool.

1138
01:33:13,020 --> 01:33:14,940
All right, well, congratulations on the award.

1139
01:33:14,940 --> 01:33:17,540
What did you get for that?

1140
01:33:17,540 --> 01:33:18,460
We just got a trophy.

1141
01:33:18,460 --> 01:33:19,060
That was it.

1142
01:33:19,060 --> 01:33:21,180
It seems that cons are getting cheaper and cheaper.

1143
01:33:21,180 --> 01:33:22,760
I remember when you won, they gave you

1144
01:33:22,760 --> 01:33:26,180
a box set and a stack of music and other stuff.

1145
01:33:26,180 --> 01:33:27,300
Now it's just a certificate.

1146
01:33:27,300 --> 01:33:30,180
Hey, you got a Naruto-Con trophy.

1147
01:33:30,180 --> 01:33:32,580
Who needs a fucking Oscar, right?

1148
01:33:32,580 --> 01:33:34,540
True.

1149
01:33:34,540 --> 01:33:36,540
I have my fandom.

1150
01:33:36,540 --> 01:33:40,540
There you go. Alright, before I let you go, can I get an amen?

1151
01:33:40,540 --> 01:33:42,540
Amen!

1152
01:33:42,540 --> 01:33:44,540
Thank you very much, have a good one.

1153
01:33:44,540 --> 01:33:46,540
You too. Later.

1154
01:33:46,540 --> 01:33:52,540
I'd like it to be said that that whole phone call is like, why I don't go to anime conventions anymore.

1155
01:33:52,540 --> 01:33:54,540
Why not?

1156
01:33:54,540 --> 01:33:56,540
Have you been to an anime convention?

1157
01:33:56,540 --> 01:34:00,540
Not in a long time. Wait, hold on there, caller. Not in a long time.

1158
01:34:00,540 --> 01:34:07,540
The skits, you wait like three hours to get in and see the skit. It's like huge. It's like the best thing there.

1159
01:34:07,540 --> 01:34:12,540
And they're just terrible.

1160
01:34:12,540 --> 01:34:16,540
You know what? We should go do a skit at a convention sometime, because we would own.

1161
01:34:16,540 --> 01:34:20,540
We had really good ideas, but you know, we could never do them.

1162
01:34:20,540 --> 01:34:22,540
Because they'd kick us out.

1163
01:34:22,540 --> 01:34:25,540
Our technical award is getting our asses kicked out of the car.

1164
01:34:25,540 --> 01:34:27,540
Let's do the Church of Orange Lounge skit.

1165
01:34:27,540 --> 01:34:30,140
All right, sarcastic caller, I hear you over there.

1166
01:34:30,140 --> 01:34:31,740
Shut the fuck up!

1167
01:34:31,740 --> 01:34:34,140
Let's go to the caller. Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

1168
01:34:34,140 --> 01:34:37,140
Yeah, this is Legend of Zaku, always unfaithful.

1169
01:34:37,140 --> 01:34:38,140
What's on your mind, Zaku?

1170
01:34:38,140 --> 01:34:40,140
This is the one and only Legend of Zaku.

1171
01:34:40,140 --> 01:34:43,140
Did you hear that little smart-ass sitting over there going...

1172
01:34:43,140 --> 01:34:46,140
All this jive about Dillinger...

1173
01:34:46,140 --> 01:34:48,140
waiting for us to shut...

1174
01:34:48,140 --> 01:34:51,140
I'm sorry, Zaku, I will shut up now so you can talk.

1175
01:34:51,140 --> 01:34:53,140
What's on your mind?

1176
01:34:53,140 --> 01:34:55,140
It needs to be the Legend of Hang-Up.

1177
01:34:55,140 --> 01:35:01,140
All this jive about Dillinger Escape Plant's song on Guitar Freaks and Drummania.

1178
01:35:01,140 --> 01:35:05,140
The fact that it was basically shunned upon in this chatroom, no offense.

1179
01:35:05,140 --> 01:35:11,140
And, you know, Eyes of Metalhead, I mean, I mean, what's the deal with the rest of the chatroom?

1180
01:35:11,140 --> 01:35:18,140
Why is, like, you know, it's almost, it's almost split, let alone almost, you know, leaning towards hatred, towards this song.

1181
01:35:18,140 --> 01:35:19,140
You know what, Zaku?

1182
01:35:19,140 --> 01:35:22,140
See, I sense a bunch of haters about this.

1183
01:35:22,140 --> 01:35:26,080
Zach was the same thing whenever anyone brings up smile DK

1184
01:35:26,080 --> 01:35:29,140
brings up erotic brings up

1185
01:35:29,140 --> 01:35:32,740
ready for you it's either love it love it hate it hate it

1186
01:35:32,740 --> 01:35:36,020
got smiling KB for you in Iraq all

1187
01:35:36,020 --> 01:35:40,300
yes see but I kinda like them

1188
01:35:40,300 --> 01:35:43,460
so about it yeah okay

1189
01:35:43,460 --> 01:35:47,820
yeah but think about it sky think about it I mean

1190
01:35:47,820 --> 01:35:51,940
you have a song you have Konami right here who's basically have the balls to

1191
01:35:51,940 --> 01:35:57,940
to even license the song in the first place, so that way they could attract a newer type of group.

1192
01:35:57,940 --> 01:36:01,940
They're being very eclectic with the songs that they have so far.

1193
01:36:01,940 --> 01:36:08,940
And so, you know, if they were to go stateside with Gudadora, they would pick up the metal heads like that if they had that song.

1194
01:36:08,940 --> 01:36:15,940
Well, here's my thought. If they have the balls to license that song, I mean, as interesting of a selection as it is or whatever,

1195
01:36:15,940 --> 01:36:19,940
why don't they have the balls to put out a new DDR?

1196
01:36:19,940 --> 01:36:28,940
stop right there, okay? Well, that's a different story, but regarding this... No self-reflecting metalhead would ever play Guitar Freaks. Yeah, that's a different story, but regarding this one? Ever.

1197
01:36:28,940 --> 01:36:34,940
What? Oh, now that's a pretty controversial point, Dan. What would you, what makes you say that no metalhead would ever play Guitar Freaks?

1198
01:36:34,940 --> 01:36:43,940
Because, let's be honest. Because I've seen... Guitar Freaks is silly. I've seen... You're playing this plastic guitar. How about Drummania?

1199
01:36:43,940 --> 01:36:49,460
Now, drum mania is a lot cooler than guitar freaks, because drum mania is actually hammered

1200
01:36:49,460 --> 01:36:50,460
on a drum.

1201
01:36:50,460 --> 01:36:55,700
I can see somebody being like, you know, guitar freaks, I play guitar freaks at home, right,

1202
01:36:55,700 --> 01:37:00,860
and I got my little plastic ukulele, and I'm wailing out hard to whatever song I can play

1203
01:37:00,860 --> 01:37:08,180
on the home version, and I'm like, dude, I look stupid, but in my mind, you know, I'm

1204
01:37:08,180 --> 01:37:13,900
like, you know, a god of rock, and that's awesome, but it's like, we're going to get

1205
01:37:13,900 --> 01:37:17,880
When you get a metalhead, right? A real metalhead, which there aren't any more real metalheads.

1206
01:37:17,880 --> 01:37:20,000
You've all died out!

1207
01:37:20,000 --> 01:37:21,920
People who play the guitars are metalheads.

1208
01:37:21,920 --> 01:37:24,220
People who play in a band are metalheads.

1209
01:37:24,220 --> 01:37:25,240
The people who are real metalheads play the guitar.

1210
01:37:25,240 --> 01:37:27,520
I don't play the guitar freaks.

1211
01:37:27,520 --> 01:37:31,340
They play drum, they play bass, they play all that, they're in the band.

1212
01:37:31,340 --> 01:37:35,920
I've seen guys with mullets playing guitar freaks.

1213
01:37:35,920 --> 01:37:39,020
Well yeah, no, no, no. bullet and metalhead...

1214
01:37:39,020 --> 01:37:39,940
Well, alright.

1215
01:37:39,940 --> 01:37:41,060
Yeah, gotcha!

1216
01:37:41,060 --> 01:37:46,460
got told. But still. Think about it. Think about the metalheads that play not only DDR

1217
01:37:46,460 --> 01:37:51,420
but bimani games in general. Like me. I, you know, it started off with DDR and then it

1218
01:37:51,420 --> 01:37:57,060
moved on to other games like 2DX. And you'd never see a metalhead playing DDR. Ever. But

1219
01:37:57,060 --> 01:38:02,660
Zaku is saying he is a metalhead who's playing DDR. Zaku's a faker. Yeah, that's true. Metalheads

1220
01:38:02,660 --> 01:38:09,860
do, metalheads do two things, right? They smoke weed and they listen to metal. And that's

1221
01:38:09,860 --> 01:38:10,860
Hey man.

1222
01:38:10,860 --> 01:38:11,860
That's bull, man.

1223
01:38:11,860 --> 01:38:12,860
It's just a stereotype.

1224
01:38:12,860 --> 01:38:16,860
It wouldn't be a stereotype if it wasn't true.

1225
01:38:16,860 --> 01:38:20,700
You'd be surprised at the number of people that play DDR, not just regular, not just...

1226
01:38:20,700 --> 01:38:24,420
No, no, I wouldn't be, trust me, I wouldn't be surprised at the number of people who play

1227
01:38:24,420 --> 01:38:25,420
DDR.

1228
01:38:25,420 --> 01:38:29,100
I'd be surprised at the number of metalheads who play DDR, because as far as I'm concerned,

1229
01:38:29,100 --> 01:38:30,100
that number is zero.

1230
01:38:30,100 --> 01:38:31,100
Yes.

1231
01:38:31,100 --> 01:38:33,220
Well, no, you got one right here.

1232
01:38:33,220 --> 01:38:34,220
Yes, sir.

1233
01:38:34,220 --> 01:38:35,220
Okay.

1234
01:38:35,220 --> 01:38:36,220
Vaku, congratulations.

1235
01:38:36,220 --> 01:38:37,900
You are the exception that proves the rule.

1236
01:38:37,900 --> 01:38:39,660
I'm wrong.

1237
01:38:39,660 --> 01:38:47,820
are rushing to arcades right now to throw down the mad dance dance action

1238
01:38:47,820 --> 01:38:53,160
because you know the brand of electronic hip-hop or not even hip-hop electronic

1239
01:38:53,160 --> 01:38:58,740
pop music inside of it really appeals to the rocker in their soul

1240
01:38:58,740 --> 01:39:03,640
yeah but we're different, well we play DDR remember that I know yes you are

1241
01:39:03,640 --> 01:39:09,640
Dude, nothing like B4U, the fucking J-pop metalhead rockers.

1242
01:39:09,640 --> 01:39:19,640
That's what I'm talking about. You know it's true. There is no self-respecting metalhead who would hear the music from a B-mani machine and not run over and kill it.

1243
01:39:19,640 --> 01:39:28,640
Now maybe that one song we just heard might be the beginning of the metalhead bimani renaissance. It's not happening.

1244
01:39:28,640 --> 01:39:35,640
I need to clarify something for Zaku. We've made careers out of taking things out of context, okay?

1245
01:39:35,640 --> 01:39:37,640
Politicians do it every day.

1246
01:39:37,640 --> 01:39:48,640
And, incidentally, the opinions of my fucked up self are in no way, shape, or form the opinions of Orange Lounge Radio, or anybody else in the whole damn world.

1247
01:39:48,640 --> 01:39:49,640
But they're pretty damn funny.

1248
01:39:49,640 --> 01:39:51,640
Exactly, I agree with that.

1249
01:39:51,640 --> 01:39:52,640
Quick buck on my program.

1250
01:39:52,640 --> 01:39:58,640
The fact of the matter is this, you know, there's not only metalheads or any other type of people playing DDR

1251
01:39:58,640 --> 01:40:00,640
Dude, you're taking off his headset

1252
01:40:00,640 --> 01:40:09,640
Yeah, people who listen to rap music, but yes, rap people playing DDR, you know, punks, scots, metalheads, as I said before

1253
01:40:09,640 --> 01:40:10,640
Almost everyone plays them

1254
01:40:10,640 --> 01:40:11,640
Don't forget fags

1255
01:40:11,640 --> 01:40:12,640
Even if you might not know it

1256
01:40:12,640 --> 01:40:13,640
Exactly

1257
01:40:13,640 --> 01:40:32,120
That's just killing it, that's just killing it, you just killed it right there.

1258
01:40:32,120 --> 01:40:33,120
Sorry.

1259
01:40:33,120 --> 01:40:37,800
Konami has the balls to go that far, I mean, you know, live with it, I mean, that's what

1260
01:40:37,800 --> 01:40:41,920
they did, it's already been done, the license has already been acquired, and it's gonna

1261
01:40:41,920 --> 01:40:47,520
be in there no matter what you say. That's it. Seriously, I've been arguing for years

1262
01:40:47,520 --> 01:40:51,720
that there needs to be more metal music in Guitar Freaks. Because it would appeal to

1263
01:40:51,720 --> 01:40:58,280
me. But again, I can't really see a real metal head going out there playing. Yeah, but you

1264
01:40:58,280 --> 01:41:05,240
don't know that for sure. Sorry, I'm sorry if I'm talking over you. You have to take

1265
01:41:05,240 --> 01:41:10,280
for a second and think of Konami's rationale. What do they want out of Guitar Freaks and

1266
01:41:10,280 --> 01:41:16,560
any other Bomani game. You know, more people. In most cases they would love to pick up many

1267
01:41:16,560 --> 01:41:22,500
types of people. Not just the typical regular person who probably doesn't listen to metal,

1268
01:41:22,500 --> 01:41:28,280
but just a new type. Spread out their base a little. So that way they get everyone. And

1269
01:41:28,280 --> 01:41:31,380
they get more, you know, and that's more salient than that.

1270
01:41:31,380 --> 01:41:36,620
You know what? You know what? The bottom line is, and we gotta move on soon. As much as

1271
01:41:36,620 --> 01:41:39,880
Of course I enjoy it when you call into the show Zaku because damn I haven't laughed this

1272
01:41:39,880 --> 01:41:44,880
hard in months.

1273
01:41:44,880 --> 01:41:51,700
I think the Gita Dora mix is promising to be a very diverse selection of music.

1274
01:41:51,700 --> 01:41:55,500
And if we win over some metal heads, then hey great.

1275
01:41:55,500 --> 01:42:00,800
And if we don't, well we always have the fags, right?

1276
01:42:00,800 --> 01:42:05,180
It wins for everyone because the more it's eclectic, the more everyone will join in.

1277
01:42:05,180 --> 01:42:09,700
Incidentally, since the games aren't meant for America anyway,

1278
01:42:09,700 --> 01:42:13,200
they're just appealing to the Japanese Metalhead. And the Japanese Metalhead

1279
01:42:13,200 --> 01:42:16,200
is stuck in 1988.

1280
01:42:16,200 --> 01:42:19,820
When metal was metal. That is a very good observation. Before it was

1281
01:42:19,820 --> 01:42:23,460
RAWR! RAWR! RAWR! RAWR!

1282
01:42:23,460 --> 01:42:27,220
The one game is RAWR!

1283
01:42:27,220 --> 01:42:31,780
More 80's rock. On that note, Zack Kocarfreak.

1284
01:42:31,780 --> 01:42:34,780
And I'm putting up the horns. Watch the webcam. The horns are up.

1285
01:42:34,780 --> 01:42:39,780
I think we should bury the hatchet right now. I think it's done. I think I flamed and ranted long enough. I made my point clear.

1286
01:42:39,780 --> 01:42:40,780
All right.

1287
01:42:40,780 --> 01:42:42,780
The metalhead's in the bikini scene. That's it.

1288
01:42:42,780 --> 01:42:44,780
Have a good one, Zaku. Thank you for your...

1289
01:42:44,780 --> 01:42:46,780
Good man, Zaku.

1290
01:42:46,780 --> 01:42:47,780
Goodbye.

1291
01:42:47,780 --> 01:42:48,780
Later.

1292
01:42:48,780 --> 01:42:49,780
Bye.

1293
01:42:49,780 --> 01:42:51,780
I can hear that a little bit, by the way, just so you know.

1294
01:42:51,780 --> 01:42:52,780
All right.

1295
01:42:53,780 --> 01:42:54,780
Wow.

1296
01:42:57,780 --> 01:43:00,780
Damn, you need to come visit us more often. That was good stuff.

1297
01:43:00,780 --> 01:43:05,020
Alright, I need a break after that. I need to breathe a little bit.

1298
01:43:05,020 --> 01:43:08,100
Alright, we'll open up the Skyline later for

1299
01:43:08,100 --> 01:43:11,940
more of you guys who want to call in. In the meantime though, we've got a cage match to get to.

1300
01:43:11,940 --> 01:43:14,340
We want to get to the FUs of the Week as well and some other

1301
01:43:14,340 --> 01:43:18,120
news. Maybe we'll have time for a DDR Freak post of the week. I don't know, we'll see.

1302
01:43:18,120 --> 01:43:19,420
Speaking of DDR Freak,

1303
01:43:19,420 --> 01:43:22,460
Friday nights, check it out, Orange Soft Radio Rewind.

1304
01:43:22,460 --> 01:43:26,100
Maybe you are checking us out right now on the rewind over there. We appreciate

1305
01:43:26,100 --> 01:43:27,540
their support in helping us out

1306
01:43:27,540 --> 01:43:30,980
and their efforts to help us

1307
01:43:30,980 --> 01:43:34,380
convert people to the Church of Orange Lounge. Can I get an Amen?

1308
01:43:34,380 --> 01:43:38,540
Amen. Amen. Alright, that's great. That was some enthusiasm there.

1309
01:43:38,540 --> 01:43:41,860
Alright, let's go to this. In fact, I have a somewhat

1310
01:43:41,860 --> 01:43:46,740
inspirational sounding piece here to kick off our seventh style break of

1311
01:43:46,740 --> 01:43:48,620
music. So we'll start it off with this one

1312
01:43:48,620 --> 01:43:53,100
called Glorious Days and we'll be back after this. Because every day Orange Lounge Radio is on

1313
01:43:53,100 --> 01:43:54,260
it's a glorious day, right?

1314
01:43:54,260 --> 01:43:56,260
So Damn Glorious!

1315
01:45:24,260 --> 01:45:25,700
What kind of love am I?

1316
01:45:54,260 --> 01:45:56,260
Thanks for watching!

1317
01:47:54,260 --> 01:48:13,260
Baby, it's long, let's go We change the door, the lights will go

1318
01:48:13,260 --> 01:48:16,260
Whoa Baby, it's long, let's go

1319
01:48:16,260 --> 01:48:20,260
Life forever, can't wait till tomorrow

1320
01:48:20,260 --> 01:48:48,260
I want you baby, maybe tonight

1321
01:48:48,260 --> 01:48:50,260
I take you far away

1322
01:48:50,260 --> 01:48:53,260
I see you dancing

1323
01:48:53,260 --> 01:48:56,260
Shining like a jewel

1324
01:48:56,260 --> 01:48:58,260
Burning for love

1325
01:48:58,260 --> 01:49:02,260
In the golden light of love inside of

1326
01:49:02,260 --> 01:49:05,260
My breath, my heaven

1327
01:49:05,260 --> 01:49:08,260
Your precious fire for me

1328
01:49:08,260 --> 01:49:10,260
Baby it's all this gold

1329
01:49:10,260 --> 01:49:14,260
Reaching out, I don't wanna let you go

1330
01:49:14,260 --> 01:49:16,260
Baby it's all this gold

1331
01:49:16,260 --> 01:49:23,260
Can't wait till tomorrow, baby it's all in gold

1332
01:49:23,260 --> 01:49:27,260
Reaching out, I don't wanna let you go, oh

1333
01:49:27,260 --> 01:49:31,260
Baby it's all in gold, it's all in gold

1334
01:49:31,260 --> 01:49:33,260
Can't wait till tomorrow

1335
01:49:33,260 --> 01:49:48,260
I need you, baby

1336
01:49:48,260 --> 01:49:50,260
What is it for you?

1337
01:50:18,260 --> 01:50:25,260
The beauty of the night

1338
01:50:48,260 --> 01:50:50,260
The beauty of life

1339
01:51:48,260 --> 01:52:12,980
We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio, after, oh man, I had to catch my breath after, I

1340
01:52:12,980 --> 01:52:14,220
was just laughing so hard.

1341
01:52:14,220 --> 01:52:15,580
Dan, you crack me up.

1342
01:52:15,580 --> 01:52:16,580
I'm glad you're here.

1343
01:52:16,580 --> 01:52:17,580
That's what I do.

1344
01:52:17,580 --> 01:52:22,580
Go buy an ignition pad at the Marconi GameStuff.

1345
01:52:22,580 --> 01:52:25,580
Be the first in line to be berated by Dan.

1346
01:52:25,580 --> 01:52:29,580
That's right. Dan will berate you and your taste of music in person and tell you...

1347
01:52:29,580 --> 01:52:36,580
Only if you don't, you know, you step up saying, I'm the DDR playing metal freak.

1348
01:52:36,580 --> 01:52:41,580
You know what? At the next DDR tournament, I'm going to find a bunch of metalheads to, you know, send you a special F.U.

1349
01:52:41,580 --> 01:52:44,580
Well, Zach has already proven that he's the exception to the rule.

1350
01:52:44,580 --> 01:52:47,420
I think we can find at least one other.

1351
01:52:47,420 --> 01:52:49,220
There was another guy in the chatroom saying that he was...

1352
01:52:49,220 --> 01:52:51,580
I'm saying my argument is now null and void.

1353
01:52:51,580 --> 01:52:55,260
I said no metalheads are Bimani fans and he said I'm a metalhead, I don't want to be on

1354
01:52:55,260 --> 01:52:58,020
BIMA, so I don't have any way to disprove his metalness.

1355
01:52:58,020 --> 01:53:01,500
I can't say that his Bimani-ness makes him less of a metalhead.

1356
01:53:01,500 --> 01:53:06,080
The truth is the guy might eat, sleep, and breathe metal and then go out and play DDR.

1357
01:53:06,080 --> 01:53:08,700
Maybe he puts on a Walkman and listens to metal while he's playing DDR.

1358
01:53:08,700 --> 01:53:10,180
So basically you got pwned.

1359
01:53:10,180 --> 01:53:11,180
I got told.

1360
01:53:11,180 --> 01:53:12,180
That's what I said.

1361
01:53:12,180 --> 01:53:17,180
You know, you said, you said, I'm a metalhead, so I guess I'm wrong. I got told.

1362
01:53:17,180 --> 01:53:21,180
Alright, uh, Loki, you were wanting to say, mention something there?

1363
01:53:21,180 --> 01:53:28,180
Um, crap, I don't even remember now, um, damn, I don't remember.

1364
01:53:28,180 --> 01:53:29,180
I just tried to blank.

1365
01:53:29,180 --> 01:53:31,180
You were bugging to back me up.

1366
01:53:31,180 --> 01:53:32,180
I was, I'm sure I was.

1367
01:53:32,180 --> 01:53:36,180
I appreciate it. I don't want to alienate, I don't want to alienate Elizabeth.

1368
01:53:36,180 --> 01:53:40,180
I cannot remember what the hell I was thinking, it just like, went away.

1369
01:53:40,180 --> 01:53:53,180
Oh, and I remember, and I remember. I was just gonna say, yeah, Metalhead's playing DDR, that was like the black people watching the films nominated for the Oscars, as Chris Rock was pointing out in the beginning of the Oscars. That was great.

1370
01:53:54,180 --> 01:54:07,180
Yeah, he was going around at, what was the theater, the Magic Johnson theater, asking the people if they'd seen Sideways or Million Dollar Baby. They're like, no, and he says, what was your favorite movie of the last year? And some of them are like, Chronicles of Riddick.

1371
01:54:07,180 --> 01:54:10,620
What are you laughing at there?

1372
01:54:10,620 --> 01:54:15,260
Tell the listeners what's up. The link that DJ Ron Mazz posted in the chat room

1373
01:54:15,260 --> 01:54:20,380
of the PlayStation 3. It's not for real though, is it? What is it?

1374
01:54:20,380 --> 01:54:23,980
It's a fake, but it's funny. Nobody knows what the PlayStation 3 is.

1375
01:54:23,980 --> 01:54:28,300
Well, you know, I just, we just got a new submission for Orange Launch Radio. I'm

1376
01:54:28,300 --> 01:54:30,000
having to turn it down because it's not

1377
01:54:30,000 --> 01:54:34,380
citing a source for more information, but somebody did send us a new submission

1378
01:54:34,380 --> 01:54:35,020
that says

1379
01:54:35,020 --> 01:54:43,720
coming to us from Summer Dog says Nintendo will debut the Nintendo Revolution in May at E3.

1380
01:54:43,720 --> 01:54:45,720
Well, we'll find out when we're at E3.

1381
01:54:45,720 --> 01:54:52,720
That's old news. All three console makers were going to be debuting their new consoles at E3.

1382
01:54:52,720 --> 01:54:54,720
We'll be lucky to get to attack them on the PS3.

1383
01:54:54,720 --> 01:54:57,220
So, that's not surprising. I knew that was coming.

1384
01:54:57,220 --> 01:54:59,220
Yeah, we'll be lucky to get to attack them on the PS3, I swear.

1385
01:54:59,220 --> 01:55:11,220
What people don't know is the connectivity with the DS, which will be with the new system, because it will be also wireless Bluetooth or whatever it is.

1386
01:55:11,220 --> 01:55:21,220
I think Sony will be downplaying the PS3 at E3. I think they'll be really trying to push the PSP. And I don't think they have enough of a system together yet.

1387
01:55:21,220 --> 01:55:25,180
All they've said is, cell processor rocks and it's finished, and that we're using an

1388
01:55:25,180 --> 01:55:27,660
upgraded emotion engine as VIO.

1389
01:55:27,660 --> 01:55:31,940
All I know is we're selling UMD movies now, we're distributing them, so.

1390
01:55:31,940 --> 01:55:32,940
Oh yeah?

1391
01:55:32,940 --> 01:55:33,940
That's sad.

1392
01:55:33,940 --> 01:55:37,660
I don't really want to see that format take off at all.

1393
01:55:37,660 --> 01:55:38,660
It won't.

1394
01:55:38,660 --> 01:55:41,820
I think it's gonna flop just like DVHS.

1395
01:55:41,820 --> 01:55:42,820
What's DVHS UAS?

1396
01:55:42,820 --> 01:55:43,820
Yeah, that's right.

1397
01:55:43,820 --> 01:55:44,820
Special VHS.

1398
01:55:44,820 --> 01:55:49,760
Well, I was, we were talking about this briefly on the podcast, which by the way, if you haven't

1399
01:55:49,760 --> 01:55:55,060
check out the podcast, check it out, www.orangelaunchradio.com and click on Orange Launch Radio to go for

1400
01:55:55,060 --> 01:55:59,820
more information on the podcast. Check it out, bitches. But what we were talking about

1401
01:55:59,820 --> 01:56:04,740
on there a couple weeks ago, we were talking about the UMD format and how potential is

1402
01:56:04,740 --> 01:56:09,120
this thing to be successful, and I said not really, because there's a very limited capacity

1403
01:56:09,120 --> 01:56:14,060
of movies that can be shown on the PSP that would be popular, such as maybe children's

1404
01:56:14,060 --> 01:56:19,540
shows and action big bang movies like Hellboy, you know, Batman, whatever.

1405
01:56:19,540 --> 01:56:23,340
You'll see anything that's owned by Sony. Yeah, and Spiderman.

1406
01:56:23,340 --> 01:56:27,500
Columbia Pictures, Action Flicks. Yeah, you're not going to be seeing dramas

1407
01:56:27,500 --> 01:56:31,300
on the PSP. Exactly, you wouldn't see drama, foreign films,

1408
01:56:31,300 --> 01:56:33,140
you are not going to see that stuff on a PSP.

1409
01:56:33,140 --> 01:56:38,340
With a new format, it's not going to happen. DVD has taken over the market.

1410
01:56:38,340 --> 01:56:40,740
It's been the first thing since VHS to do so.

1411
01:56:40,740 --> 01:56:45,260
There's always been a superior format to VHS out there.

1412
01:56:45,260 --> 01:56:46,260
Like beta?

1413
01:56:46,260 --> 01:56:50,340
Beta, laserdisc, you know, all sorts of stuff.

1414
01:56:50,340 --> 01:56:51,740
None of it could ever take over the market.

1415
01:56:51,740 --> 01:56:56,580
The only thing I could see that possibly happening with this is the price point's pretty good.

1416
01:56:56,580 --> 01:57:02,340
It is $19.99 retail for these, which is kind of like that sweet number for like movies

1417
01:57:02,340 --> 01:57:07,740
and stuff that you could see like, you know, a new release movie coming out UMD or whatever

1418
01:57:07,740 --> 01:57:10,260
at the same time.

1419
01:57:10,260 --> 01:57:15,900
But it's just really honestly, the format less, and this is a big if, unless like the

1420
01:57:15,900 --> 01:57:21,340
new PS3 is gonna play UMD and DVD or something like that, you know, I don't really see any

1421
01:57:21,340 --> 01:57:23,980
people buying stuff just to take it with them on the road.

1422
01:57:23,980 --> 01:57:32,660
I mean, do you really need to watch, you know, Spider-Man 2 that much?

1423
01:57:32,660 --> 01:57:36,260
And the difference, you know, a lot of times people, you know, have DVD players in cars

1424
01:57:36,260 --> 01:57:39,060
and I can see this is why they're trying to market this.

1425
01:57:39,060 --> 01:57:43,900
But that's because each individual kid has their own screen or there's an essential screen

1426
01:57:43,900 --> 01:57:44,900
there.

1427
01:57:44,900 --> 01:57:50,500
You're right, kids are going to try to share a portable game system to watch a movie.

1428
01:57:50,500 --> 01:57:51,500
It's not going to happen.

1429
01:57:51,500 --> 01:57:56,620
Well, it's just that Sony develops technology, and they feel compelled to use this technology

1430
01:57:56,620 --> 01:57:57,900
somehow.

1431
01:57:57,900 --> 01:57:59,180
Like Minidisc.

1432
01:57:59,180 --> 01:58:02,660
How many years has Sony spent trying to pimp Minidisc?

1433
01:58:02,660 --> 01:58:04,980
They're still trying to pimp that shit.

1434
01:58:04,980 --> 01:58:05,980
700.

1435
01:58:05,980 --> 01:58:07,100
Yeah, they're still.

1436
01:58:07,100 --> 01:58:10,220
They're still trying to push MiniDisc as a viable format, and MiniDisc will never be

1437
01:58:10,220 --> 01:58:11,220
a viable format.

1438
01:58:11,220 --> 01:58:16,400
Yes, it has its uses, sure, it's a neat little machine.

1439
01:58:16,400 --> 01:58:19,940
You know, if the PSP took MiniDiscs, that would rock.

1440
01:58:19,940 --> 01:58:20,940
But it's not happening.

1441
01:58:20,940 --> 01:58:21,940
That would have been a smart idea.

1442
01:58:21,940 --> 01:58:22,940
Yeah.

1443
01:58:22,940 --> 01:58:25,460
Because the discs are the same size, am I not correct?

1444
01:58:25,460 --> 01:58:26,460
About?

1445
01:58:26,460 --> 01:58:27,700
Except for the UMD is rounded.

1446
01:58:27,700 --> 01:58:29,020
Oh, jeez.

1447
01:58:29,020 --> 01:58:35,900
So, but yeah, it's like, if your PSP could play MiniDisc audio, that would be sick.

1448
01:58:35,900 --> 01:58:40,600
It's the same thing with the UMD movie format.

1449
01:58:40,600 --> 01:58:45,560
It's like Sony developed the technology and they're a publicly traded company.

1450
01:58:45,560 --> 01:58:49,000
So it took them a gajillion years and stock orders are going, what the crap are you going

1451
01:58:49,000 --> 01:58:50,000
to do with this UMD?

1452
01:58:50,000 --> 01:58:53,200
And Sony was like, we're going to make a portable game system out of it.

1453
01:58:53,200 --> 01:58:56,320
Now they're like, we can play movies with it, too.

1454
01:58:56,320 --> 01:59:00,960
They feel compelled to use it and that's good.

1455
01:59:00,960 --> 01:59:05,760
It'd be nice that it takes off and I think that it's cool to have a handheld that's going

1456
01:59:05,760 --> 01:59:11,720
to play discs. And this proprietary new format will never, ever, ever... Do anything else.

1457
01:59:11,720 --> 01:59:17,000
No, be able to be pirated to a PC to be played on an emulator. Oh sure. Or pirated over the

1458
01:59:17,000 --> 01:59:22,880
internet. Because it's proprietary and we'll never, they just can't read them. You know

1459
01:59:22,880 --> 01:59:28,000
that in like 20 minutes they're going to be on Licksang. Licksang's going to be like,

1460
01:59:28,000 --> 01:59:34,760
you can only buy these for purposeful backing up. Very legal. Don't pirate. You'll get a

1461
01:59:34,760 --> 01:59:44,320
a suit. Hey, man. Alright. Well, we'll see how the format does when the launch of the

1462
01:59:44,320 --> 01:59:47,560
PSP is coming up very soon. Do you remember the launch date? It's March... March 24th.

1463
01:59:47,560 --> 01:59:52,840
March 24th. If you live in the Sacramento area, GameStop, Marconi and Fulton, come reserve

1464
01:59:52,840 --> 01:59:57,360
yours now. If you don't, when you come in to buy one, and I don't have any because I

1465
01:59:57,360 --> 02:00:02,960
won't, I'm going to laugh my ass off. I will not be getting a PSP on launch day. We'll

1466
02:00:02,960 --> 02:00:03,960
I've decided.

1467
02:00:03,960 --> 02:00:04,960
Alright, that sounds good.

1468
02:00:04,960 --> 02:00:05,960
I traded in a DS.

1469
02:00:05,960 --> 02:00:07,960
Oh, see, I love my DS.

1470
02:00:07,960 --> 02:00:08,960
We had two.

1471
02:00:08,960 --> 02:00:09,960
I still have my DS.

1472
02:00:09,960 --> 02:00:10,960
Oh, that's good.

1473
02:00:10,960 --> 02:00:11,960
It's our DS now.

1474
02:00:11,960 --> 02:00:13,960
It lives in my laptop bag.

1475
02:00:13,960 --> 02:00:15,960
Okay, well, I guess it's my PSP.

1476
02:00:15,960 --> 02:00:16,960
Alright.

1477
02:00:16,960 --> 02:00:17,960
Oh, God told.

1478
02:00:17,960 --> 02:00:18,960
Alright.

1479
02:00:18,960 --> 02:00:21,920
She made me just pop me the bird.

1480
02:00:21,920 --> 02:00:25,760
Can you believe that that kind of behavior would be going on here?

1481
02:00:25,760 --> 02:00:26,760
Look at that.

1482
02:00:26,760 --> 02:00:31,960
Well, if you think about what it means in slang terms, you know, hey, hot.

1483
02:00:31,960 --> 02:00:41,960
yeah let's get to the orange lounge radio cage match shall we three songs

1484
02:00:41,960 --> 02:00:47,840

click on chat to participate it's just a fun little thing we do to do for you

1486
02:00:52,120 --> 02:00:57,520
guys to have an input and a say and what goes in orange lounge radio lives 24

1487
02:00:57,520 --> 02:01:02,640
hour a day, seven day a week, Bamani Music and More program. You get one song to put

1488
02:01:02,640 --> 02:01:07,640
in there. So, here are your three choices for tonight. The way this works, we play three

1489
02:01:07,640 --> 02:01:12,320
songs for you guys. The one that gets the most votes from you guys in the chatroom goes

1490
02:01:12,320 --> 02:01:17,440
into rotation all week long. You only get to hear a clip of the song that won last week.

1491
02:01:17,440 --> 02:01:22,360
And speaking of last week, we actually had a song win for the third time, which means

1492
02:01:22,360 --> 02:01:31,120
If it wins tonight, it is retired forever, and it will become only the third song in

1493
02:01:31,120 --> 02:01:35,360
Orange Lounge history to lay claim to that title, which is very interesting because we've

1494
02:01:35,360 --> 02:01:37,680
retired quite a few songs in the past couple months.

1495
02:01:37,680 --> 02:01:42,040
All the retired songs were just recently in the past few months, so very interesting.

1496
02:01:42,040 --> 02:01:48,440
All right, here it is for the fourth week in a row, going for its final win and that

1497
02:01:48,440 --> 02:01:55,440
ultimate retireship freeze-pop with stakeout

1498
02:02:18,440 --> 02:02:34,440
I've got a plan in mind for you, I'm waiting till the time is right

1499
02:02:34,440 --> 02:02:37,940
I know that you like what I do, no need to put up a fight

1500
02:02:37,940 --> 02:02:40,940
Watching you from far away, you look so sweet and clueless

1501
02:02:40,940 --> 02:02:43,940
Soon I'll move in on my prey. It's time for me to do this.

1502
02:02:57,440 --> 02:02:59,440
Watching and waiting

1503
02:03:00,440 --> 02:03:03,440
The feeling is elating

1504
02:03:03,940 --> 02:03:05,440
Finding my time

1505
02:03:05,440 --> 02:03:23,800
Can't let you see me, can't let you see me, can't let you see me

1506
02:03:23,800 --> 02:03:50,280
Alright, that was last week's winner for the third time in a row, Freeze Pop with Stake

1507
02:03:50,280 --> 02:03:51,280
Out.

1508
02:03:51,280 --> 02:03:55,200
some new songs that are going to challenge that tonight. And we're going to start it

1509
02:03:55,200 --> 02:03:58,480
off with Loki's pick. Loki, what did you pick for us tonight?

1510
02:03:58,480 --> 02:04:08,480
Uh, Girls. The hell? Okay, I picked, no I did not pick Girls. That joke is old and done

1511
02:04:08,480 --> 02:04:14,480
with, I missed my opportunity for that joke, don't worry I'll come back. And um, so I picked

1512
02:04:14,480 --> 02:04:21,420
a different song I picked another a different drama label artist and this

1513
02:04:21,420 --> 02:04:26,960
group is called the dignity of labor and their song actually the one only song I

1514
02:04:26,960 --> 02:04:32,080
see that this artist has done at least it's on a different drum called xrv the

1515
02:04:32,080 --> 02:04:38,480
never aka mix and it's I don't know what the hell an xrv is I didn't listen to

1516
02:04:38,480 --> 02:04:45,600
the lyrics of the song but it sounds cool so this is the song for you all

1517
02:04:45,600 --> 02:04:50,120
right from a different drum the dignity of labor XRVs and ever after me and I

1518
02:04:50,120 --> 02:04:54,960
even it edited down for you guys because you know it was a club type song you

1519
02:04:54,960 --> 02:05:00,440
know so I edited the end down so don't listen to all that no drum track and

1520
02:05:00,440 --> 02:05:06,120
everything but it's still a good six minutes long it's like five and a half

1521
02:05:06,120 --> 02:05:16,980
my thing says six and a half it should not be hold on a second here oh you

1522
02:05:16,980 --> 02:05:22,020
probably copied it earlier does that say edit on it okay that's because you

1523
02:05:22,020 --> 02:05:29,700
didn't copy the right one I was prepared you just tried to screw me over damn it

1524
02:05:29,700 --> 02:05:41,700
I had it all ready to go for you, and I took all the extra time to edit it down for you, and you know what, this is the thanks I get.

1525
02:05:41,700 --> 02:05:54,700
See, a six and a half version would have been the one with, you know, the outro on it. So I got rid of that, so you don't have to listen to it, you know. So now we have the one that's, you know, good.

1526
02:05:54,700 --> 02:06:01,700
Alright, here it is, dignity of labor, XRV, enjoy.

1527
02:06:54,700 --> 02:07:03,700
There is a fallacy on your shield A fabrication you can't reconcile

1528
02:07:03,700 --> 02:07:08,700
And all around you crumbles like a brittle tie

1529
02:07:08,700 --> 02:07:14,700
And the way you keep yourself concealed Is like a vacant threat

1530
02:07:14,700 --> 02:07:22,700
Beside that certain smile And deep inside you rings a tone you can't deny

1531
02:07:22,700 --> 02:07:41,060
I may be blind, but I can't see The sex of the old man

1532
02:08:41,060 --> 02:08:55,060
If you're looking for a reason I can show you all I see

1533
02:08:55,060 --> 02:08:59,060
It reflects on me

1534
02:08:59,060 --> 02:09:02,060
Imagination

1535
02:09:02,060 --> 02:09:05,060
Imagination

1536
02:09:05,060 --> 02:09:09,060
It's integration

1537
02:09:09,060 --> 02:09:14,060
With the imagination of me

1538
02:09:14,060 --> 02:09:21,060
There is no form I cannot penetrate If only you could see the pain I feel in you

1539
02:09:44,060 --> 02:09:51,060
A mirror to your soul is free Without a trace of vanity

1540
02:09:51,060 --> 02:10:01,060
I'll share with you the mastery Reveal your agony with XRV

1541
02:10:01,060 --> 02:10:04,060
Yeah, yeah

1542
02:10:04,060 --> 02:10:11,060
XRV, yeah

1543
02:11:41,060 --> 02:11:53,060
Okay, that was song number two in tonight's cage match. The Dignity of Labor with XRV, the Neveraca mix. Was that A-okay or was it A-S-S? Jamie.

1544
02:11:53,060 --> 02:12:03,060
There wasn't enough variation in it to really make it. It was very generic sounding, I'm sorry. It was better than Freeze Pop, I'll give it that.

1545
02:12:03,060 --> 02:12:10,060
Better than Freeze Pop, that's all you need to know. Low-key, is that all you have to say about it anymore?

1546
02:12:10,060 --> 02:12:15,340
anymore it's better than freeze pop anything is better than freeze pop

1547
02:12:15,340 --> 02:12:23,380
anything anything I mean it give it a score it gets a better than freeze pop

1548
02:12:23,380 --> 02:12:28,700
score Dan your opinion on the song and then you give it something on a scale of

1549
02:12:28,700 --> 02:12:35,140
one to ten that song was eternal I didn't think you would ever and that

1550
02:12:35,140 --> 02:12:40,140
That being said, it didn't suck. It was just really long. I'll give it a 7.

1551
02:12:41,140 --> 02:12:50,140
I disagree with Loki. Freezepop is better than that song. Not that that song was bad, it was just very, very, very long and very, very, very dry.

1552
02:12:51,140 --> 02:13:00,140
Like, I think I could cut about a minute and a half out of that song and I'd really like it, but as far as the, like, six and a half minute marathon mix, man, whatever, no.

1553
02:13:00,140 --> 02:13:04,140
So I give it a six for the number of minutes it almost was.

1554
02:13:04,140 --> 02:13:08,140
For dry, long, free-rise is awesome.

1555
02:13:08,140 --> 02:13:12,140
Jamie, your turn, your pick. What'd you pick for us tonight?

1556
02:13:12,140 --> 02:13:15,140
I know it's a remix of Bloodhound Gang.

1557
02:13:15,140 --> 02:13:17,140
It sure is. The Bad Touch.

1558
02:13:17,140 --> 02:13:19,140
Yes, but it's by KMFDM.

1559
02:13:19,140 --> 02:13:20,140
Yeah.

1560
02:13:20,140 --> 02:13:24,140
Which should be interesting.

1561
02:13:24,140 --> 02:13:29,740
Yeah, I remember I had forgotten that I had it and then I looked on a DVD like oh I have this cool

1562
02:13:30,740 --> 02:13:33,340
All right. So here it is. Anything else you want to say about it?

1563
02:13:34,740 --> 02:13:38,900
Let's do it bloodhound gang the bad touch kmfdm mix. Enjoy

1564
02:13:38,900 --> 02:13:52,400
Well now, we call this the act of making, but there are several other very important

1565
02:13:52,400 --> 02:13:59,400
differences between human beings and animals that you should know about.

1566
02:14:22,400 --> 02:14:26,400
Can you do the kind of stuff that holy prince would sing about?

1567
02:14:26,400 --> 02:14:30,400
So put your hands down my pants, and I'll bet you'll feel nuts

1568
02:14:30,400 --> 02:14:34,400
Yes, I'm Cisco, yes, I'm Ebert, and you're getting two thumbs up

1569
02:14:34,400 --> 02:14:38,400
You've had enough of two in touch, you want it rough, you're out of bounds

1570
02:14:38,400 --> 02:14:42,400
I watch you smother, once you've covered, like my waffle hound, sash browns

1571
02:14:42,400 --> 02:14:44,400
I'm a different X, I will reach you apex, just like you before

1572
02:14:44,400 --> 02:14:50,400
Stop, you are inclined to meet me, rise an hour early, just like daylight savings time

1573
02:14:50,400 --> 02:14:53,700
You and me, baby, ain't nothing but mammals

1574
02:14:53,700 --> 02:14:57,700
So let's do it like they do on the Discovery Channel

1575
02:14:57,700 --> 02:14:58,400
Do it again now

1576
02:14:58,400 --> 02:15:01,400
You and me, baby, ain't nothing but mammals

1577
02:15:01,400 --> 02:15:05,400
So let's do it like they do on the Discovery Channel

1578
02:15:05,400 --> 02:15:06,400
Oh, here's one of them

1579
02:15:21,400 --> 02:15:25,400
Love, the kind you clean up with the mop and bucket

1580
02:15:25,400 --> 02:15:29,400
Like the lost catacombs of Egypt, only God knows where we stuck it

1581
02:15:29,400 --> 02:15:32,400
Hieroglyphics, let me be specific, I wanna be down in your south seat

1582
02:15:32,400 --> 02:15:34,400
But I got this notion that the motion of your ocean

1583
02:15:34,400 --> 02:15:36,400
Being a small craft advisory

1584
02:15:36,400 --> 02:15:37,400
So if I'm exercising

1585
02:15:37,400 --> 02:15:38,400
With eyes, eyes, eyes and thighs

1586
02:15:38,400 --> 02:15:40,400
You suck my battleship

1587
02:15:40,400 --> 02:15:41,400
Please turn me on

1588
02:15:41,400 --> 02:15:42,400
I'm Mr. Coffee

1589
02:15:42,400 --> 02:15:44,400
With an automatic tip

1590
02:15:44,400 --> 02:15:45,400
So show me yours

1591
02:15:45,400 --> 02:15:46,400
I'll show you my tool job

1592
02:15:46,400 --> 02:15:48,400
You'll love it just like Lyle

1593
02:15:48,400 --> 02:15:50,400
And then we'll do it doggy style

1594
02:15:50,400 --> 02:15:52,400
So we can both watch your smiles

1595
02:15:52,400 --> 02:15:53,400
Do it now

1596
02:15:53,400 --> 02:15:54,400
You and me, baby

1597
02:15:54,400 --> 02:15:55,400
Not too long ago

1598
02:15:55,400 --> 02:15:57,400
So let's do it like they do

1599
02:15:57,400 --> 02:15:59,400
On the Discovery Channel

1600
02:15:59,400 --> 02:16:00,400
Do it again now

1601
02:16:00,400 --> 02:16:08,400
You and me, baby, ain't nothing but mammals So let's do it like they do on the Discovery Channel

1602
02:16:08,400 --> 02:16:30,840
You and me, baby, ain't nothin' but mammals So let's do it like they do on the Discovery

1603
02:16:30,840 --> 02:16:32,120
channel Do it again now

1604
02:16:32,120 --> 02:16:39,480
You and me baby ain't nothin' but mammals so let's do it like they do on the Discovery Channel

1605
02:16:39,480 --> 02:16:47,660
You and me baby ain't nothin' but mammals, so let's do it like they do on the Discovery Channel

1606
02:16:47,660 --> 02:16:55,380
You and me baby ain't nothin' but mammals, so let's do it like they do on the Discovery Channel

1607
02:16:55,380 --> 02:17:23,380
We're the boy now We're the boy now

1608
02:17:53,380 --> 02:18:07,700
All right, that was Bloodhound Gang with a Bad Touch, KMSDM mix, song number three tonight.

1609
02:18:07,700 --> 02:18:10,780
Let's see what the folks in the studio thought of that one.

1610
02:18:10,780 --> 02:18:11,780
Jamie?

1611
02:18:11,780 --> 02:18:17,700
I love that song, and I had set it aside, and then I found the mix and was like, I love

1612
02:18:17,700 --> 02:18:18,700
this mix.

1613
02:18:18,700 --> 02:18:24,700
It's a great mix of a great song, so it gets a 9.8 infinity.

1614
02:18:24,700 --> 02:18:26,700
I think she's forcing her own song.

1615
02:18:26,700 --> 02:18:32,700
Because I get to vote for any damn song I want to, as official goddess of this radio station.

1616
02:18:32,700 --> 02:18:36,700
Well, also you have to remember though, yeah, you got pwned again.

1617
02:18:36,700 --> 02:18:37,700
You have to remember that we...

1618
02:18:37,700 --> 02:18:39,700
I get pwned all the time.

1619
02:18:39,700 --> 02:18:45,700
We actually don't get to vote for the winner. We just get to give our big fat opinions. It's like American Idol.

1620
02:18:45,700 --> 02:18:51,660
Simon gets to give his opinion, but he doesn't get to pick the winner so it's like that Loki your opinion

1621
02:18:52,500 --> 02:18:54,500
Get the time because it's cam FDM

1622
02:18:57,060 --> 02:18:59,060
And it's better than freeze pop

1623
02:19:00,620 --> 02:19:07,260
I actually like the original song quite a bit, but I'm sorry Jamie. I really did not take that remix at all I

1624
02:19:07,820 --> 02:19:13,660
Wasn't feeling it. I'm sorry. I like the Eiffel 65 mix of that song a lot, but maybe because it's more euro

1625
02:19:13,660 --> 02:19:18,660
I don't know, but I wasn't into that one. I can only really give that a six as well. I'm sorry

1626
02:19:19,420 --> 02:19:20,620
Dan

1627
02:19:20,620 --> 02:19:25,340
That remix was the mad generic. It's like words from the song

1628
02:19:27,060 --> 02:19:34,280
Words from the song it gets like a four and a half. That's only because if I scored any lower then y'all throw heavier things

1629
02:19:36,780 --> 02:19:38,780
All right, well while Jamie

1630
02:19:38,780 --> 02:19:41,780
Oh, three and a half.

1631
02:19:41,780 --> 02:19:45,540
While Jamie finds something heavy to throw at Dan,

1632
02:19:45,540 --> 02:19:48,060
let's recap the three songs you can vote for tonight,

1633
02:19:48,060 --> 02:19:49,940
starting with Freeze Pops, Stakeout.

1634
02:19:49,940 --> 02:19:50,440
One and a half.

1635
02:19:50,440 --> 02:19:51,100
One and a half.

1636
02:19:51,100 --> 02:19:53,560
Shake you out.

1637
02:19:53,560 --> 02:19:55,540
6.9.

1638
02:19:55,540 --> 02:19:58,260
I'm on a stakeout.

1639
02:19:58,260 --> 02:20:05,260
song number two the dignity of labor with x r v

1640
02:20:13,500 --> 02:20:17,820
and song number three the bloodhound gang with bad touch the apple sixty

1641
02:20:17,820 --> 02:20:23,180
uh... sorry bad touch and no euro crap on my phone thank you

1642
02:20:23,180 --> 02:20:30,180
Sorry, wishful thinking there. The KMFDM mix.

1643
02:20:37,420 --> 02:20:39,540
Alright guys, place

1644
02:20:39,540 --> 02:20:44,900

1645
02:20:44,900 --> 02:20:48,100

1646
02:20:48,100 --> 02:20:52,100
Doo doo doo doo doo.

1647
02:20:52,100 --> 02:20:56,100
Now your words are a mix.

1648
02:20:56,100 --> 02:21:00,100
Alright, Loki! What's going on in the Sims scene lately?

1649
02:21:00,100 --> 02:21:04,100
Rob, have we heard

1650
02:21:04,100 --> 02:21:08,100
any more news about the election that was last year?

1651
02:21:08,100 --> 02:21:12,100
What in the hell

1652
02:21:12,100 --> 02:21:16,100
are you talking about? Just say no because there's nothing going on

1653
02:21:16,100 --> 02:21:23,920
on the sim scene nothing zero nada there's more going on in my bathroom right now than

1654
02:21:23,920 --> 02:21:29,560
there is in the god damn sim scene dude their bathroom is scary too nothing to be honest

1655
02:21:29,560 --> 02:21:35,140
there's more sim files out there guess what they still suck there's more really crappy

1656
02:21:35,140 --> 02:21:39,800
songs that people make that still really suck and there's more max remixes out there that

1657
02:21:39,800 --> 02:21:47,120
still really suck. To be honest, I think you really need to go out and play another game.

1658
02:21:47,120 --> 02:21:52,200
Because, because honestly there's nothing for you on the internet as far as setme is

1659
02:21:52,200 --> 02:21:56,240
concerned. Do you really need any more sim files? I mean, my God, there's like thousands

1660
02:21:56,240 --> 02:22:01,560
of them out there. You can't tell me that you honestly play all of them all the time.

1661
02:22:01,560 --> 02:22:08,520
So, really, you know, get into another game. Maybe, you know, discover girls. I don't know.

1662
02:22:08,520 --> 02:22:14,280
just something else but really there's nothing going on at all in the sim scene

1663
02:22:14,280 --> 02:22:16,640
nothing nada

1664
02:22:16,640 --> 02:22:20,720
except for one little thing and that's just that this

1665
02:22:20,720 --> 02:22:22,800
loki doing his part to promote the hari

1666
02:22:22,800 --> 02:22:25,240
this is pdrxxmix official website

1667
02:22:25,240 --> 02:22:29,160
they're doing version 2.0 right now and they have this funny little thing on there

1668
02:22:29,160 --> 02:22:30,560
i just have to read it

1669
02:22:30,560 --> 02:22:32,620
because it's just you know funny

1670
02:22:32,620 --> 02:22:34,240
and um...

1671
02:22:34,240 --> 02:22:34,960
it is

1672
02:22:34,960 --> 02:22:36,720
this little engrish thing it says

1673
02:22:36,720 --> 02:22:39,960
How can we stand as dancer to dance?

1674
02:22:39,960 --> 02:22:44,400
So I just thought that was funny and that's all that I have to contribute as far as that.

1675
02:22:44,400 --> 02:22:49,320
How can we stand as dancer to dance?

1676
02:22:49,320 --> 02:22:52,960
What was that thing you were looking at? I saw you looking at something earlier.

1677
02:22:52,960 --> 02:22:54,240
It was like a popin'

1678
02:22:54,240 --> 02:22:57,400
music StepMania thing and I thought that looked interesting.

1679
02:22:57,400 --> 02:23:02,880
Uh, StepMania, the pop candy theme that's not even available for download, so that's it.

1680
02:23:02,880 --> 02:23:06,520
There's nothing going on, really. I mean,

1681
02:23:06,520 --> 02:23:08,880
nothing not a uh...

1682
02:23:08,880 --> 02:23:10,940
ddr uk is gone

1683
02:23:10,940 --> 02:23:14,400
uh... ddr maniacs is never coming back as far as i'm concerned it's been gone for

1684
02:23:14,400 --> 02:23:15,520
months so

1685
02:23:15,520 --> 02:23:18,280
really does anyone miss it now uh...

1686
02:23:18,280 --> 02:23:21,340
it's just it's gone

1687
02:23:21,340 --> 02:23:24,460
ddr uk i'm sure you're gonna come back someday but

1688
02:23:24,460 --> 02:23:27,720
it's gonna be too late anyways it's just like the melting pot remember that old

1689
02:23:27,720 --> 02:23:29,680
ass sight that used to be around

1690
02:23:29,680 --> 02:23:33,460
uh... it's gone so um...

1691
02:23:33,460 --> 02:23:38,460
I'm afraid to say it, but yeah. There's nothing going on in the sim scene. The sim scene's dying. It's gone.

1692
02:23:38,460 --> 02:23:43,460
It's really, there's not much left. So, that's it.

1693
02:23:43,460 --> 02:23:48,460
Now wait a minute. I played a cool thing that one of our listeners did.

1694
02:23:48,460 --> 02:23:53,460
He did a Simphile to the Gem theme song by Freezepop, and it was pretty rad, I gotta say.

1695
02:23:53,460 --> 02:24:00,460
Check it out, guys. It's pretty rad. It is outrageous. Truly, truly, truly outrageous.

1696
02:24:00,460 --> 02:24:05,460
Dude, the Misfits songs are better. They're gonna get ya.

1697
02:24:05,460 --> 02:24:10,460
I want, you know what I want? Oh my god! Oh my god! Sim people! Oh my god! Sim people! Sim people! Oh my god! Oh my god!

1698
02:24:10,460 --> 02:24:18,460
Do this. Get all of Gem's songs and make like an all Gem DDR mix.

1699
02:24:18,460 --> 02:24:28,460
And you can have some Misfits songs too, because they were cool too, but like, I want to make like this whole mix of DDR just out of songs that were featured in Gem.

1700
02:24:28,460 --> 02:24:37,460
tell me that would not rock that would not rock you're a liar yes I am come on

1701
02:24:37,460 --> 02:24:43,580
Loki they can open up DDR UK back up for this I was just gonna give you an example

1702
02:24:43,580 --> 02:24:50,380
here of why there's nothing available right now and I really got to find the

1703
02:24:50,380 --> 02:24:54,540
song I downloaded earlier and I know I'm probably gonna find it there's just too

1704
02:24:54,540 --> 02:25:02,900
much shit out there right now. Here we go. Okay, this is the perfect example of why you

1705
02:25:02,900 --> 02:25:11,940
do not need, I mean, just sim files nowadays, they're just really bad, and I cannot stress

1706
02:25:11,940 --> 02:25:19,940
how bad they are, but I think I can come close with this song right here. Now, granted, it's

1707
02:25:19,940 --> 02:25:26,640
not as colorful as Mac's vagina but you know what it's pretty bad and this is a

1708
02:25:26,640 --> 02:25:33,900
sim file you can go out there and you can definitely thank Thunderbird that's

1709
02:25:33,900 --> 02:25:43,580
byrd24 on BomaniStyle.com for this wonderful piece of crap this is

1710
02:25:43,580 --> 02:25:53,580
six subs seven grams of fat or seven subs of six grams of fat enjoy

1711
02:26:43,580 --> 02:26:57,260
make it stop now how do I unplug your computer how do I do it please turn it

1712
02:26:57,260 --> 02:27:03,860
off Jesus yes I can oh dear God see see that that that right there that right

1713
02:27:03,860 --> 02:27:13,180
there is why this stuff sucks really do we need this crap honestly okay

1714
02:27:13,180 --> 02:27:16,180
This is why the sim scene is dying. It's because of the crap, okay?

1715
02:27:16,180 --> 02:27:18,180
I'm done.

1716
02:27:19,180 --> 02:27:21,180
Alright.

1717
02:27:25,180 --> 02:27:34,180
Well, I just made a last call for Cagematch votes, uh, and it's been about 30 seconds, so I think that's enough time. Do you guys want to know who won tonight's Cagematch?

1718
02:27:35,180 --> 02:27:36,180
Sure.

1719
02:27:36,180 --> 02:27:37,180
Do we ever.

1720
02:27:37,180 --> 02:27:40,180
This is a very interesting situation.

1721
02:27:40,180 --> 02:27:45,340
One vote yet again decides the cage match

1722
02:27:45,340 --> 02:27:49,020
and it decides the cage match to be a

1723
02:27:49,020 --> 02:27:52,260
tie once again. Tie cage match.

1724
02:27:52,260 --> 02:27:59,260
Song number one tied tonight.

1725
02:28:00,260 --> 02:28:03,700
Dignity of labor XRV

1726
02:28:03,700 --> 02:28:07,380
and song number two tied tonight.

1727
02:28:07,380 --> 02:28:19,380
Let's go to the rule book that shows that, oh yes, if in case of a tie, the host whose

1728
02:28:19,380 --> 02:28:22,500
song did not get picked gets to break the tie.

1729
02:28:22,500 --> 02:28:29,380
So Jamie, is she going to retire freeze pop or is she going to deny freeze pop that right

1730
02:28:29,380 --> 02:28:30,900
and pick the other song?

1731
02:28:30,900 --> 02:28:32,100
Freeze pop's going down.

1732
02:28:32,100 --> 02:28:36,820
On one hand, I could torture all of our listeners with more freeze pop.

1733
02:28:36,820 --> 02:28:40,500
I did that last time.

1734
02:28:40,500 --> 02:28:43,820
Rob. Rob. Yes. What? What?

1735
02:28:43,820 --> 02:28:47,500
LOSER!

1736
02:28:47,500 --> 02:28:51,380
LOSER! That's alright, that's alright.

1737
02:28:51,380 --> 02:28:54,740
Rob. What? Rob. What? What?

1738
02:28:54,740 --> 02:29:00,540
Alright, so new winner tonight, thanks to Jamie.

1739
02:29:00,540 --> 02:29:04,820
Jamie denies freeze-pop the entrance to retire.

1740
02:29:04,820 --> 02:29:08,380
XRV wins. But in reality, kids,

1741
02:29:08,380 --> 02:29:11,620
you don't agree with that, maybe you should have gotten your friend a vote,

1742
02:29:11,620 --> 02:29:15,900
because only one vote made the difference there.

1743
02:29:15,900 --> 02:29:22,580
Alright, so next week you all get Britney Spears remix, courtesy of me, so

1744
02:29:22,580 --> 02:29:23,380
enjoy that

1745
02:29:23,380 --> 02:29:26,540
next week. And I'll throw in the J-Lo. Awesome.

1746
02:29:26,540 --> 02:29:31,140
We're going to have an awesome cage match next week. Loki's going to play that song we just heard.

1747
02:29:31,140 --> 02:29:38,620
Alright, yes, we definitely need the FUs after that one. So we're going to go to break, and

1748
02:29:38,620 --> 02:29:43,280
then when we come back, the FUs of the week. So, send us your FUs over private message

1749
02:29:43,280 --> 02:29:50,380
and we'll get to them. In this break, you get a potpourri. You get potpourri de baumannii.

1750
02:29:50,380 --> 02:29:56,520
Potpourri de baumannii. Potpourri, right. Potpourri. Starting it off with Setsugekka

1751
02:29:56,520 --> 02:30:00,320
We'll be back with more Orange Launch Radio.

1752
02:35:56,520 --> 02:36:24,840
The

1753
02:36:24,840 --> 02:36:43,440
Welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio. We are going to get into the FUs of the week fairly

1754
02:36:43,440 --> 02:36:49,120
shortly here. Again, we are on opposite the Oscars tonight, so thank you guys for being

1755
02:36:49,120 --> 02:36:53,720
loyal and sticking with us. And of course the chat room is all up in arms because they

1756
02:36:53,720 --> 02:36:58,680
all arguing about who won. It sounds like it was a million dollar baby night, cuz it

1757
02:36:58,680 --> 02:37:03,760
took the best picture and it took the best director, yadda yadda yadda yadda yadda.

1758
02:37:03,760 --> 02:37:07,920
I know, I don't care this year. The only ones I saw, I saw Finding Neverland, which I really

1759
02:37:07,920 --> 02:37:11,800
really liked, but for some reason people wanted to stay far away from that movie, but it was

1760
02:37:11,800 --> 02:37:15,560
really good, I guess because supposedly the guy was an accused child molester or something,

1761
02:37:15,560 --> 02:37:20,880
but it was a good movie, whatever, let it just be a movie. And I saw Sideways, which

1762
02:37:20,880 --> 02:37:26,280
was also funny. You know who the real winners were? The people who didn't watch

1763
02:37:26,280 --> 02:37:31,960
the Oscars. Those are the real winners. Because in the end they'll have more

1764
02:37:31,960 --> 02:37:36,480
money than you'll ever have and they're gonna rub it in your face. And they suck.

1765
02:37:36,480 --> 02:37:43,640
Who cares? And actually I would say the best motion picture of the year

1766
02:37:43,640 --> 02:37:47,720
would be Paris Hilton sex tape actually would be the Oscar winner for this year.

1767
02:37:47,720 --> 02:37:51,720
I don't know if you saw it, but it was a fine performance by Ms. Hilton.

1768
02:37:51,720 --> 02:37:54,720
Negative. Negative.

1769
02:37:54,720 --> 02:38:01,720
When she just stops in the middle of what she's doing to pick up that cell phone, I was moved.

1770
02:38:01,720 --> 02:38:03,720
There was no dramatic focus.

1771
02:38:03,720 --> 02:38:12,720
Personally, I thought that the art direction and Cameron Diaz, the bondage video that she did, was much better.

1772
02:38:12,720 --> 02:38:13,720
Say what?

1773
02:38:13,720 --> 02:38:18,120
Yeah, there's a camera Cameron Diaz bondage video it fucking hot

1774
02:38:20,100 --> 02:38:22,100
Anyways

1775
02:38:22,480 --> 02:38:24,480
Jamie's computer to look up some porn

1776
02:38:26,800 --> 02:38:30,340
Now we know where that spy was coming from we did we did

1777
02:38:31,320 --> 02:38:35,800
We did watch like I don't know like 10 minutes of the Oscars while I was sitting here on the TV

1778
02:38:35,800 --> 02:38:39,000
We were waiting for the show to start and Drew Barrymore came out

1779
02:38:39,000 --> 02:38:47,000
And what did Loki say something about, I saw a movie with her in it where she was naked and had blood on her boobs. What was that? What was that you were talking about?

1780
02:38:47,000 --> 02:38:57,000
She was in this really shitty horror movie and I don't remember the name of it but there was a shower scene where blood was coming out of the shower heads and it was going over her breasts.

1781
02:38:57,000 --> 02:39:06,000
So she was being, it was her naked with her boobies and her boobies were being covered by fake blood. Oh yeah.

1782
02:39:06,000 --> 02:39:09,000
And the funny thing about Drew Barrymore was she was like 10 at the time.

1783
02:39:13,000 --> 02:39:18,000
And she was already cracked out and had to take these really bad movies to keep her career alive.

1784
02:39:18,000 --> 02:39:25,000
Wow. Let's move on to the FUs of the week, shall we?

1785
02:39:25,000 --> 02:39:28,000
Jamie, why is it we do these FUs of the week every single week?

1786
02:39:28,000 --> 02:39:33,000
Because Jamie hates humanity.

1787
02:39:33,000 --> 02:39:35,000
I don't think he's all of you.

1788
02:39:35,000 --> 02:39:38,000
I mean, Paul, this is bad.

1789
02:39:38,000 --> 02:39:40,000
Here is justice.

1790
02:39:40,000 --> 02:39:42,000
Here is punishment.

1791
02:39:42,000 --> 02:39:44,000
Here...

1792
02:39:44,000 --> 02:39:46,000
This is fucked up.

1793
02:39:46,000 --> 02:39:52,000
They suck you to dust, and the two years of it, the fourth of it that we stirred up.

1794
02:39:52,000 --> 02:39:53,000
Five years.

1795
02:39:53,000 --> 02:39:55,000
You didn't live in that damn apartment for five years.

1796
02:39:55,000 --> 02:39:57,000
Four years.

1797
02:39:57,000 --> 02:39:59,000
Lots of years.

1798
02:39:59,000 --> 02:40:02,000
Shut up, Mike, my F.U.

1799
02:40:02,000 --> 02:40:04,000
Big F.U. to my allergies.

1800
02:40:04,000 --> 02:40:09,000
F.U. to stupid people who speed past me in the rain.

1801
02:40:09,000 --> 02:40:12,000
F.U. to Dan for interrupting me.

1802
02:40:12,000 --> 02:40:14,000
Yeah.

1803
02:40:14,000 --> 02:40:17,560
I'm surprised that actually you guys don't get an F you to Dan every week

1804
02:40:18,120 --> 02:40:25,080
I'm mad. In fact, I think that by now it should just be a feature. So Jamie F you to Dan right fucking duh

1805
02:40:28,040 --> 02:40:32,200
Shut up, please. Word. Or I'll throw the ferret at you

1806
02:40:33,920 --> 02:40:35,920
Throw the ferret? Does that mean what I think it means?

1807
02:40:37,000 --> 02:40:39,000
It doesn't

1808
02:40:39,000 --> 02:40:44,000
And ask you to being sick for a week.

1809
02:40:44,000 --> 02:40:47,000
Oh you bitch!

1810
02:40:47,000 --> 02:40:49,000
I threw the first bat.

1811
02:40:49,000 --> 02:40:54,000
The voice thing landed on my collarbone.

1812
02:40:54,000 --> 02:40:55,000
Ask you to pay.

1813
02:40:55,000 --> 02:40:57,000
Collarbone nothing.

1814
02:40:57,000 --> 02:40:58,000
I hit her in the rack.

1815
02:40:58,000 --> 02:40:59,000
I'm a good throw.

1816
02:40:59,000 --> 02:41:01,000
Hit me on my damn collarbone.

1817
02:41:01,000 --> 02:41:02,000
Shut up, this is radio.

1818
02:41:02,000 --> 02:41:03,000
They don't know.

1819
02:41:03,000 --> 02:41:08,000
You hit my laptop you die.

1820
02:41:38,000 --> 02:41:57,000
First off, fucking the Oscars, because they still suck. Even if you do get Chris Rock to host it, that does not make them any better. They just still suck. And I feel sorry for Chris Rock for having to do that. I know he's hard up on money, so...

1821
02:41:57,000 --> 02:42:02,300
and then need to take that job but my god you know what's gonna be next Dave

1822
02:42:02,300 --> 02:42:07,800
Chappelle hosting the Oscars that might get me to watch it but I don't think

1823
02:42:07,800 --> 02:42:12,200
it's gonna happen fuck you to my computer for first off you know the

1824
02:42:12,200 --> 02:42:16,000
power supply being all fucked up and then I have to get a new one and then

1825
02:42:16,000 --> 02:42:22,680
the stupid little fan that was you know cooling my graphics prop card there well

1826
02:42:22,680 --> 02:42:27,560
Well it's too noisy so I had to pull it out of there as well and come to find out it wasn't

1827
02:42:27,560 --> 02:42:28,560
doing shit.

1828
02:42:28,560 --> 02:42:32,760
Actually the fan was not even over the heat sink so it was doing nothing.

1829
02:42:32,760 --> 02:42:34,760
So that kind of was lame.

1830
02:42:34,760 --> 02:42:41,200
And then, um, Fuck You to Final Fantasy because it's been all laggy and weird lately.

1831
02:42:41,200 --> 02:42:42,200
I don't know why.

1832
02:42:42,200 --> 02:42:46,800
It's like you'd think that they hosted the servers in the United States or something.

1833
02:42:46,800 --> 02:42:49,320
Because, I mean, they're really shitty.

1834
02:42:49,320 --> 02:42:55,420
And then uh fuck you to Golf Land because once again you just do not maintain your stuff

1835
02:42:55,420 --> 02:43:01,380
there I mean my god I can't believe you would think that they were Microsoft or something

1836
02:43:01,380 --> 02:43:10,740
with all the shit that was broken there I just don't get it and um finally um fuck you

1837
02:43:10,740 --> 02:43:12,740
Okay, I'm done.

1838
02:43:20,740 --> 02:43:22,740
FU to Final Fantasy XI.

1839
02:43:22,740 --> 02:43:25,740
I'm really getting sick of your bullshit, you little game.

1840
02:43:25,740 --> 02:43:28,740
Link, come over here so I can kick your ass.

1841
02:43:30,740 --> 02:43:35,740
And FU to me sleeping 12 hours yesterday and 10 hours today. That's a lot of sleep.

1842
02:43:35,740 --> 02:43:44,140
and F you to some drama that was going on last week F oh my god F you to big

1843
02:43:44,140 --> 02:43:48,680
projects that fall in my lap at the last freaking minute I hate that stuff I hate

1844
02:43:48,680 --> 02:43:51,340
it you guys have more advanced notices this

1845
02:43:51,340 --> 02:43:54,580
quick giving it to me at the last minute and then making me like die I hate that

1846
02:43:54,580 --> 02:44:12,060
I have not. I can't say I have. And then F you to people, people bitching about the

1847
02:44:12,060 --> 02:44:18,180
Oscars because you know I have to do this show. I don't get to go to the big gay Oscar

1848
02:44:18,180 --> 02:44:22,900
party and sit around and be catty and talk about how ugly everybody looks in their dress

1849
02:44:22,900 --> 02:44:23,900
with people.

1850
02:44:23,900 --> 02:44:25,900
It's a big gay party.

1851
02:44:25,900 --> 02:44:26,900
Yes.

1852
02:44:26,900 --> 02:44:31,000
Because if I wasn't doing this show, I would be at a big gay Oscar party right now.

1853
02:44:31,000 --> 02:44:32,000
I know I would.

1854
02:44:32,000 --> 02:44:35,480
Because the Oscars are the Super Bowls for gays.

1855
02:44:35,480 --> 02:44:36,480
It is.

1856
02:44:36,480 --> 02:44:40,200
If I wasn't doing this show, I'd be at an Oscar party, too, because we're having a free

1857
02:44:40,200 --> 02:44:43,620
one at work and I'd get free booze and food.

1858
02:44:43,620 --> 02:44:45,400
That's the only reason I'd go, though, is for the free booze and food.

1859
02:44:45,400 --> 02:44:47,280
I wouldn't go because of the Oscars.

1860
02:44:47,280 --> 02:44:49,120
Fuck the Oscars.

1861
02:44:49,120 --> 02:44:51,880
I'd do what I do for all of our company parties.

1862
02:44:51,880 --> 02:44:57,080
I go get food, get full, and leave, and say fuck them, I ain't waiting for the end of

1863
02:44:57,080 --> 02:44:58,080
your party.

1864
02:44:58,080 --> 02:44:59,080
Totally.

1865
02:44:59,080 --> 02:45:01,000
Free food would have rocked.

1866
02:45:01,000 --> 02:45:04,280
I could go for like some cocktail weenies right now.

1867
02:45:04,280 --> 02:45:05,280
Don't make the gay joke.

1868
02:45:05,280 --> 02:45:06,280
Stop.

1869
02:45:06,280 --> 02:45:07,280
Stop it.

1870
02:45:07,280 --> 02:45:09,280
We did that for the Seinfeld last episode.

1871
02:45:09,280 --> 02:45:15,680
We totally crashed the Seinfeld party, ate their food and left.

1872
02:45:15,680 --> 02:45:17,160
Were there cocktail weenies there?

1873
02:45:17,160 --> 02:45:18,880
No, bad cake.

1874
02:45:18,880 --> 02:45:19,880
Cake is good.

1875
02:45:19,880 --> 02:45:26,640
See, I could be eating Oscar cake right now, but I'm doing this show.

1876
02:45:26,640 --> 02:45:27,640
I'm spent.

1877
02:45:27,640 --> 02:45:28,640
Jamie?

1878
02:45:28,640 --> 02:45:29,640
I have one to add.

1879
02:45:29,640 --> 02:45:30,640
You have one you wanted to add.

1880
02:45:30,640 --> 02:45:31,640
Okay.

1881
02:45:31,640 --> 02:45:32,640
F.U.

1882
02:45:32,640 --> 02:45:35,200
Desquenix for pushing back the date for the Final Fantasy XI Atlas.

1883
02:45:35,200 --> 02:45:36,960
That's it.

1884
02:45:36,960 --> 02:45:37,960
Are they writing it themselves?

1885
02:45:37,960 --> 02:45:41,680
I think, I think you gotta blame Brady Games for that one.

1886
02:45:41,680 --> 02:45:45,560
Oh, Brady, well, Brady Games sucks anyway.

1887
02:45:45,560 --> 02:45:46,560
Alright.

1888
02:45:46,560 --> 02:45:48,360
Dan, did you have any F.U.s of the week you wanted to give while you were here?

1889
02:45:48,360 --> 02:45:53,840
the level of giant f you at ultra K who who think that they're super clever

1890
02:45:53,840 --> 02:46:02,120
trying to trademark the name maim and the logo for maim because he wants you

1891
02:46:02,120 --> 02:46:07,920
know to have I guess a hold on the emulation market the guy's name is David

1892
02:46:07,920 --> 02:46:13,560
R Foley and he's an asshole and he'll never win because it's not his logo to

1893
02:46:13,560 --> 02:46:14,560
to begin with.

1894
02:46:14,560 --> 02:46:20,060
Well yeah, it predates its company by like, what, five years?

1895
02:46:20,060 --> 02:46:22,240
Ultracade by the way sucks.

1896
02:46:22,240 --> 02:46:23,240
Ultracade sucks.

1897
02:46:23,240 --> 02:46:27,120
And I bet you if you take apart an ultracade and decompile a source code, I bet you that

1898
02:46:27,120 --> 02:46:28,120
it's made anyway.

1899
02:46:28,120 --> 02:46:29,120
Bastard.

1900
02:46:29,120 --> 02:46:30,120
And that's about it.

1901
02:46:30,120 --> 02:46:36,640
So I got, Ultracade's need to burn in hell.

1902
02:46:36,640 --> 02:46:40,160
I was all down with Ultracade, because I'm like, dude, that's a good idea.

1903
02:46:40,160 --> 02:46:45,840
I was gonna save that for, you know, our podcast, but, uh, you know, whatever.

1904
02:46:45,840 --> 02:46:47,360
Hey, that's all good.

1905
02:46:47,360 --> 02:46:48,360
Sorry about that.

1906
02:46:48,360 --> 02:46:49,360
I don't know, Biggie.

1907
02:46:49,360 --> 02:46:50,360
We'll talk about it all day.

1908
02:46:50,360 --> 02:46:51,360
We're gonna love the show.

1909
02:46:51,360 --> 02:46:53,640
Say fuck off to Ultracade.

1910
02:46:53,640 --> 02:46:54,640
Y'all go to arcades.

1911
02:46:54,640 --> 02:46:58,960
You go to arcades, kick the Ultracade when you walk by it.

1912
02:46:58,960 --> 02:46:59,960
I did yesterday.

1913
02:46:59,960 --> 02:47:05,400
I'm not just talking booty at once, I'm talking kick the fucking hell out of her.

1914
02:47:05,400 --> 02:47:06,400
Okay.

1915
02:47:06,400 --> 02:47:07,400
I, I, you know what?

1916
02:47:07,400 --> 02:47:10,760
the first Church of Orange Lounge proclamation.

1917
02:47:10,760 --> 02:47:12,320
Kick the Ultracade.

1918
02:47:12,320 --> 02:47:14,020
Coming in at one.

1919
02:47:14,020 --> 02:47:20,120
When thou see an Ultracade machine, or an arcade legend, thou will kick it with thy

1920
02:47:20,120 --> 02:47:22,880
boot several times.

1921
02:47:22,880 --> 02:47:25,680
Or boot it with your kick.

1922
02:47:25,680 --> 02:47:28,600
That is the first official proclamation of the Church of Orange Lounge.

1923
02:47:28,600 --> 02:47:30,480
I hope you're writing this down.

1924
02:47:30,480 --> 02:47:32,680
Ultracade, thou shalt boot.

1925
02:47:32,680 --> 02:47:33,680
Alright.

1926
02:47:33,680 --> 02:47:34,680
There will be a quiz.

1927
02:47:34,680 --> 02:47:36,320
Yes there will.

1928
02:47:36,320 --> 02:47:40,720
Alright, let's move on to the chatroom FUs, unless you had anything else.

1929
02:47:40,720 --> 02:47:42,800
Uh, I'm done.

1930
02:47:42,800 --> 02:47:43,800
Fuck off with me.

1931
02:47:43,800 --> 02:47:46,000
I want chocolate.

1932
02:47:46,000 --> 02:47:48,680
I've been eating like so much ice cream today, it's disgusting.

1933
02:47:48,680 --> 02:47:50,680
I'm rating Rob Scruggs.

1934
02:47:50,680 --> 02:47:55,720
Alright, let's go on to the next, uh, chatroom FUs.

1935
02:47:55,720 --> 02:48:01,920
Zaku, our old buddy Zaku, the metalhead, says FU to actor-director Clint Eastwood for denying

1936
02:48:01,920 --> 02:48:05,040
veteran director, Martin Scorsese, his chance at an Oscar.

1937
02:48:05,040 --> 02:48:11,040
If Martin Scorsese wasn't such a cocksucker, he'd win more awards.

1938
02:48:11,040 --> 02:48:16,360
Clint Eastwood deserved it.

1939
02:48:16,360 --> 02:48:18,800
Don't get in another argument with him, please.

1940
02:48:18,800 --> 02:48:20,880
Can you give the man a hug, please, Dan?

1941
02:48:20,880 --> 02:48:21,880
Negative.

1942
02:48:21,880 --> 02:48:24,200
Can you try?

1943
02:48:24,200 --> 02:48:25,200
Can you give the man a cyber-hug?

1944
02:48:25,200 --> 02:48:29,440
If he's a real metalhead, he's all greasy and nasty and doesn't want to be hugged.

1945
02:48:29,440 --> 02:48:30,440
Alright, fine.

1946
02:48:30,440 --> 02:48:32,440
How about a handshake?

1947
02:48:32,440 --> 02:48:33,440
How about a handshake?

1948
02:48:33,440 --> 02:48:35,440
I'll give him a bong head.

1949
02:48:35,440 --> 02:48:36,440
Alright.

1950
02:48:36,440 --> 02:48:39,440
Loki, what were you going to add to that?

1951
02:48:39,440 --> 02:48:41,440
Nothing.

1952
02:48:41,440 --> 02:48:44,440
Nothing.

1953
02:48:44,440 --> 02:48:49,440
F you to my mouth being held tightly by a rubber band because of my braces and the pain it brings.

1954
02:48:49,440 --> 02:48:52,440
I've been there. It's horrible.

1955
02:48:52,440 --> 02:48:55,440
F you to having two unmerciful midterms this week.

1956
02:48:55,440 --> 02:49:01,440
F U to people that rag on Dillager Escape Plan's song in Gitadora V

1957
02:49:01,440 --> 02:49:07,440
Allusion says F U to all the freeze pop haters. It's all about fancy ultra fresh. I read a

1958
02:49:07,440 --> 02:49:12,240
review that said the CD sucked and it was better used as a frisbee. Then I scrolled

1959
02:49:12,240 --> 02:49:17,440
up on the page and saw their glowing review of yellow card CD Ocean Avenue. Then I said

1960
02:49:17,440 --> 02:49:23,280
oh I get it you have horrible taste to music. Anyway I'm rambling. F U to Jamie. It was

1961
02:49:23,280 --> 02:49:30,280
one week from retirement, one week. You know what? Suck it up! Got told, bitches! If your

1962
02:49:32,480 --> 02:49:38,920
song was good, it would have made it to four weeks, but it sucked! No, better yet, F you

1963
02:49:38,920 --> 02:49:45,920
to the people that voted for the song. Allusion continues on saying, P.S. F you to that awful

1964
02:49:45,920 --> 02:49:52,860
F you to that awful guitar freaks drum mania song that you played earlier. It's like my ears were on their period

1965
02:49:54,600 --> 02:49:56,600
No, man, I'm no no no no

1966
02:49:58,640 --> 02:50:03,120
Because no man will ever ever know what that's like

1967
02:50:04,000 --> 02:50:06,720
No one will ever know what the pain of PMS is

1968
02:50:06,720 --> 02:50:09,720
That's why we have to share with our attitude.

1969
02:50:09,720 --> 02:50:12,720
Oh, I think we do.

1970
02:50:12,720 --> 02:50:18,720
You'd like to think that, wouldn't you?

1971
02:50:18,720 --> 02:50:23,720
No, see, we had to suffer the physical pain, so we shared the emotional pain with you.

1972
02:50:23,720 --> 02:50:27,720
Come on, what's worse, physical or emotional pain?

1973
02:50:27,720 --> 02:50:31,720
Life long torture.

1974
02:50:31,720 --> 02:50:34,720
That's okay, I'll just get advice for your balls next time.

1975
02:50:34,720 --> 02:50:40,840
punishment from above

1976
02:50:40,840 --> 02:50:43,840
I'd like the level of fuck you to PMS

1977
02:50:43,840 --> 02:50:49,480
that god damn excuse for women to be bitchy doesn't need to exist

1978
02:50:49,480 --> 02:50:53,000
fucking deal with it, it's going to happen

1979
02:50:53,000 --> 02:50:58,200
for the rest of your life

1980
02:50:58,200 --> 02:51:01,680
oh my god, the menopause hits you get it

1981
02:51:01,680 --> 02:51:05,040
every day for the rest of your life I still got like seven people to go

1982
02:51:05,040 --> 02:51:13,080
through that's when you get killed I heard it here first did you ever see

1983
02:51:13,080 --> 02:51:22,200
Logan's run you know that when they're pregnant they're front-heavy so when you

1984
02:51:22,200 --> 02:51:26,120
just put them next to a cliff or something two birds of one stone man

1985
02:51:26,120 --> 02:51:37,120
Nice. Oh, hey, look, what are you doing throwing the weasel at somebody, or the weasel? What are you doing throwing the ferret at somebody else? Slut?

1986
02:51:37,120 --> 02:51:41,120
I used to throw it at Rob. Oh yeah, but we know Rob's not going to throw it at me.

1987
02:51:41,120 --> 02:51:48,120
My cheeks hurt from laughing so hard, okay? Seriously.

1988
02:51:48,120 --> 02:51:54,040
Llama Juice says, F you to Fred who works at Red Octane and I'm so damn glad his ass

1989
02:51:54,040 --> 02:51:55,040
got fired.

1990
02:51:55,040 --> 02:51:59,720
He lost a lot of people's orders making me wait another month for my Octane pad.

1991
02:51:59,720 --> 02:52:05,360
F you to school because apparently they had no problem sending them to GameStop however.

1992
02:52:05,360 --> 02:52:10,280
They're all at the GameStop on Marconi.

1993
02:52:10,280 --> 02:52:13,120
Come and buy your damn dance pad.

1994
02:52:13,120 --> 02:52:20,120
a big F U to the Gamestop distribution center for sending me 14 red octane ignition pads.

1995
02:52:21,240 --> 02:52:25,280
Llama Juice also says F U to school because I have to wake up early tomorrow.

1996
02:52:25,280 --> 02:52:31,360
And F U to anyone whose name starts with a J just because I can. Oh wait, Jamie has an

1997
02:52:31,360 --> 02:52:35,460
issue with that. Fuck you! Who is it?

1998
02:52:35,460 --> 02:52:37,560
Llama Juice. Fuck you.

1999
02:52:37,560 --> 02:52:44,560
Oh yeah, and F you to anyone who can't pronounce my name correctly, Leama Juice, WTF.

2000
02:52:46,560 --> 02:52:51,560
Leama Juice.

2001
02:52:51,560 --> 02:52:59,560
Okay, if you name yourself after an animal, a butt ugly one at that, expect to have the name pronounced like damn animals is.

2002
02:52:59,560 --> 02:53:02,560
Oh, Jamie's on the warpath now after the J comment.

2003
02:53:02,560 --> 02:53:07,560
DarkLionXVI says, F you to the gangster that hit my cousin in the head with a hammer four times.

2004
02:53:07,560 --> 02:53:12,560
Ouch. Though my cousin's fine, he suffered a big lump and several stitches.

2005
02:53:12,560 --> 02:53:16,560
I want those bastards responsible to be dead in front of me. Ouch.

2006
02:53:16,560 --> 02:53:20,560
Either that hammer was too small or that gangster wasn't swinging very hard.

2007
02:53:20,560 --> 02:53:24,560
You know what, somebody was just trying to imitate Donkey Kong where they had...

2008
02:53:24,560 --> 02:53:28,560
I'm sorry, I'm sorry. There was no reason for me to say that.

2009
02:53:28,560 --> 02:53:38,560
DarklineXVI says, F you to the right side of my body. Whenever I play 2DX and the note pattern dominates the right hand side, my right arm gets numb.

2010
02:53:38,560 --> 02:53:52,560
I just hope it's not a stroke. I completely know what you mean, because you know, when I'm masturbating vigorously, you know, my right side gets numb too sometimes, so it's totally understandable.

2011
02:53:52,560 --> 02:53:56,560
As soon as somebody said stroke, there was going to be a joke.

2012
02:53:59,560 --> 02:54:00,560
Alright.

2013
02:54:00,560 --> 02:54:04,560
Angel says, F you to me feeling like shit, tear sniff.

2014
02:54:04,560 --> 02:54:09,560
You'll notice she's not here tonight. That's because she is giving an F you because she feels like shit.

2015
02:54:12,560 --> 02:54:13,560
Yeah.

2016
02:54:13,560 --> 02:54:15,560
Uh, moving on.

2017
02:54:15,560 --> 02:54:22,440
Flair O'Nai says, F you to Rohnert Park Scandia for getting Madden Football as their

2018
02:54:22,440 --> 02:54:28,100
token one new game every six months arcade game. Also, fuck them for hypnotizing me into

2019
02:54:28,100 --> 02:54:34,840
losing my keys there last night. Step it off. 1215 says, F you to all the good

2020
02:54:34,840 --> 02:54:39,160
games coming out at the same time so I can't afford them. And F you to the people who don't

2021
02:54:39,160 --> 02:54:42,440
show up for Outside the Box, but I appreciate what Sky did on Thursday because the chat

2022
02:54:42,440 --> 02:54:48,480
was great. Thank you. DJ Rama S says, F you to Million Dollar Baby, yo. Explain to me

2023
02:54:48,480 --> 02:54:56,480
how the fuck does a movie that barely anyone heard of win? Someone pass me a 40. And lastly,

2024
02:54:56,480 --> 02:55:03,340
SSJ100Matt says, F you the week to me, to Skype, for playing the tub girl theme. I mean

2025
02:55:03,340 --> 02:55:10,620
Christina Aguilera's Dirty on Thursday's show. Long story. And also an F you to Scorsese

2026
02:55:10,620 --> 02:55:24,700
being screwed over for the best director Oscar I don't know you know we're gonna

2027
02:55:24,700 --> 02:55:30,940
hear about this for months it'll be on entertainment tonight all night long

2028
02:55:30,940 --> 02:55:41,840
tomorrow night you know what you know what I heard today you know from my

2029
02:55:41,840 --> 02:55:46,960
sister she's telling me that there is there's a show that's called celebrities

2030
02:55:46,960 --> 02:55:52,960
without makeup and it's played after American Idol edges ugly-ass celebrities

2031
02:55:52,960 --> 02:56:00,760
there was a big post it premiered on Thursday during celebrities looking like

2032
02:56:00,760 --> 02:56:04,760
You think you're bad, but look at this ugly picture of Oprah! Woooo!

2033
02:56:04,760 --> 02:56:08,760
It's like, is that what we've reduced ourselves to?

2034
02:56:08,760 --> 02:56:10,760
To like, going that they're ugly?

2035
02:56:10,760 --> 02:56:13,760
Well okay, it's on after American Idol, right? So that means it's on Fox.

2036
02:56:13,760 --> 02:56:14,760
Uh, yeah.

2037
02:56:14,760 --> 02:56:15,760
Are we all really surprised?

2038
02:56:15,760 --> 02:56:16,760
Good point.

2039
02:56:16,760 --> 02:56:20,760
This is Fox we're talking about, right? Their marquee show is The Simpsons.

2040
02:56:20,760 --> 02:56:22,760
Which is gonna be gone.

2041
02:56:22,760 --> 02:56:26,760
Actually, uh, well American Idol is their top-rated program.

2042
02:56:26,760 --> 02:56:36,760
Well, yeah, but come on, man. What's Fox's show? Like, what? It's on season, like, 3,406?

2043
02:56:36,760 --> 02:56:38,760
It's been going a while.

2044
02:56:38,760 --> 02:56:41,760
In the next episode, Homer becomes a psycho killer.

2045
02:56:41,760 --> 02:56:42,760
They did have Seinfeld.

2046
02:56:42,760 --> 02:56:46,760
Fox didn't have Seinfeld. That was NBC.

2047
02:56:46,760 --> 02:56:49,760
What's her name? Patsy is a lesbian on it now.

2048
02:56:49,760 --> 02:56:50,760
No, Patty is a lesbian.

2049
02:56:50,760 --> 02:56:51,760
Patty, whatever. Patsy, Patty, same thing.

2050
02:56:51,760 --> 02:56:55,760
Yeah, it's like, who the hell didn't see that coming?

2051
02:56:55,760 --> 02:57:03,160
they gonna get their AIDS character like Sesame Street like Sesame Street that

2052
02:57:03,160 --> 02:57:07,600
was Sesame Street Africa that had the character because a lot of folks in that

2053
02:57:07,600 --> 02:57:12,800
region where that Sesame Street was it's a very real problem they have there hey

2054
02:57:12,800 --> 02:57:20,280
what do you think got mr. Hooper all those you know monkey lovers out anyway

2055
02:57:20,280 --> 02:57:22,280
What is Grover anyway?

2056
02:57:22,280 --> 02:57:24,280
I don't know.

2057
02:57:24,280 --> 02:57:26,280
He's adorable.

2058
02:57:26,280 --> 02:57:28,280
No he's not. He's a fucking like...

2059
02:57:28,280 --> 02:57:30,280
Near?

2060
02:57:30,280 --> 02:57:32,280
He's an illegal immigrant is what he is.

2061
02:57:32,280 --> 02:57:34,280
Where?

2062
02:57:34,280 --> 02:57:36,280
They're all fucking hiding in the alleys.

2063
02:57:36,280 --> 02:57:38,280
Okay.

2064
02:57:40,280 --> 02:57:42,280
They all live in Oscar's trash can.

2065
02:57:42,280 --> 02:57:44,280
Cause you know what? You know that market that's on the street?

2066
02:57:44,280 --> 02:57:48,280
It's a big front. It's a big, you know, fucking heroin and all sorts of drugs.

2067
02:57:48,280 --> 02:57:52,280
If I had to leave a little immigrant food in my house, I'd be a grouch, too.

2068
02:57:52,280 --> 02:57:57,280
And Snuffleufficus? Man, what a pot fiend.

2069
02:57:57,280 --> 02:58:00,280
And what about Big Burt?

2070
02:58:00,280 --> 02:58:03,280
Total queer.

2071
02:58:03,280 --> 02:58:05,280
Well, we already know about Burt and Ernie.

2072
02:58:05,280 --> 02:58:08,280
And Burt is evil.

2073
02:58:08,280 --> 02:58:11,280
I am so mad that the Burt is Evil site is gone.

2074
02:58:11,280 --> 02:58:13,280
It's gone? What happened to it?

2075
02:58:13,280 --> 02:58:17,780
It's been gone for some time. I think someone mirrored it, but the original site's gone.

2076
02:58:17,780 --> 02:58:20,780
Did PBS slam the iron fist of justice on their ass?

2077
02:58:20,780 --> 02:58:21,780
600 years, probably.

2078
02:58:21,780 --> 02:58:22,780
I don't know, but...

2079
02:58:22,780 --> 02:58:23,780
Aw, how sad.

2080
02:58:23,780 --> 02:58:27,780
The children's television workshop got medieval on their ass.

2081
02:58:27,780 --> 02:58:33,280
Alright, one more story for you guys, and then it's about time to start calling it a show.

2082
02:58:33,280 --> 02:58:38,280
Red Octane, the group that creates the ignition pad.

2083
02:58:38,280 --> 02:58:41,780
Come to the GameStop, Omar, come on, we've got millions of them.

2084
02:58:41,780 --> 02:58:46,500
They're going to be publishing video games for the PlayStation 2.

2085
02:58:46,500 --> 02:58:48,500
Interesting, because Red Octane to this point

2086
02:58:48,500 --> 02:58:51,820
has always been like a distributor or a pad maker,

2087
02:58:51,820 --> 02:58:54,780
and they've never really made games.

2088
02:58:54,780 --> 02:58:57,140
Not that kind of pad maker.

2089
02:58:57,140 --> 02:58:58,660
Wow, they've never made games.

2090
02:58:58,660 --> 02:59:01,220
I'm sure their games are just going to rock.

2091
02:59:01,220 --> 02:59:04,280
They're going to be awesome, because they have so much experience in making

2092
02:59:04,280 --> 02:59:04,780
games.

2093
02:59:04,780 --> 02:59:06,020
Oh, wait, no, they don't.

2094
02:59:06,020 --> 02:59:07,900
Well, they're not actually making the game.

2095
02:59:07,900 --> 02:59:09,200
They're just going to distribute.

2096
02:59:09,200 --> 02:59:11,740
They're going to be publishing the software.

2097
02:59:11,740 --> 02:59:15,220
The first title for the PlayStation 2 computer entertainment system will be announced in

2098
02:59:15,220 --> 02:59:18,640
spring of 2005.

2099
02:59:18,640 --> 02:59:21,340
Kai Huang, president of Red Octane says,

2100
02:59:21,340 --> 02:59:24,980
Launching into a new business segment with the publishing of video games is a natural

2101
02:59:24,980 --> 02:59:26,360
evolution for us.

2102
02:59:26,360 --> 02:59:31,140
We are committed to delivering the same high quality and fun found in our peripherals with

2103
02:59:31,140 --> 02:59:34,220
the upcoming Red Octane software line.

2104
02:59:34,220 --> 02:59:40,980
So everybody, buy Red Octane accessories now, because they're going out of business.

2105
02:59:40,980 --> 02:59:45,660
well what if your store gets like 14 copies of their next game and it's like

2106
02:59:45,660 --> 02:59:50,340
MC mad cats groove 2 or something well you know you can look at this is a good

2107
02:59:50,340 --> 02:59:54,580
thing or a bad thing are there any like great dancing franchises or something

2108
02:59:54,580 --> 03:00:01,900
that happens over here I smell something I smell a distributor for in the groove

2109
03:00:01,900 --> 03:00:05,940
I was just about to say wouldn't that be hilarious if the title they end up

2110
03:00:05,940 --> 03:00:10,260
announcing is in the groove oh my god the money scene would not shut up for

2111
03:00:10,260 --> 03:00:15,340
months they would not shut up that you you could you could shoot them and the

2112
03:00:15,340 --> 03:00:18,700
face and they would not shut up about this if that's what they end up

2113
03:00:18,700 --> 03:00:21,380
publishing someone just recently announced that they're doing a pump it

2114
03:00:21,380 --> 03:00:27,820
up mix over here too yes who's doing that um I don't know I'd be a really

2115
03:00:27,820 --> 03:00:32,940
mass mass stiff who did well mass stiff designs designed I think Anna Mero is

2116
03:00:32,940 --> 03:00:37,340
gonna put it out or I don't do we have it on the site I don't remember it pump

2117
03:00:37,340 --> 03:00:42,700
up yeah and amaro did pump it up originally who would release it in the states well mastiff's

2118
03:00:42,700 --> 03:00:49,660
going to design it mastiff did something else pretty cool recently uh and amaro right

2119
03:00:51,180 --> 03:00:54,780
i thought that would be a natural fit for a red octane distributed well that would be because

2120
03:00:54,780 --> 03:00:58,300
then red octane can make a whole new pump it up pad too that would certainly be interesting real

2121
03:00:58,300 --> 03:01:03,580
popular home ddr still sells real well i mean i don't know if anyone here really cares but yeah

2122
03:01:03,580 --> 03:01:09,140
How does it say you actually work home BDR cells real? Well, yeah sell lots of copies. Mm-hmm

2123
03:01:09,620 --> 03:01:12,100
Why won't people buy fucking ignition pads? I don't know

2124
03:01:12,900 --> 03:01:15,180
But uh, he's over $20 pass home

2125
03:01:16,180 --> 03:01:19,780
Tons of them because people come back three or four times like buy one good one

2126
03:01:22,300 --> 03:01:24,300
Although no one buys MC grooves

2127
03:01:25,660 --> 03:01:27,580
So it's like

2128
03:01:27,580 --> 03:01:30,600
They're gonna they're gonna release some sort of big they're gonna release some sort of game

2129
03:01:30,600 --> 03:01:37,720
and it's just going to get smoked and then Red Octane is going to go out of business.

2130
03:01:37,720 --> 03:01:41,200
So get your ignition pads now. I won't have them forever. Someone is going to buy those

2131
03:01:41,200 --> 03:01:43,600
pads or I'm going to find someone to take them off my hands.

2132
03:01:43,600 --> 03:01:50,100
If Red Octane was publishing in the groove, doesn't Red Octane have like Konami's official

2133
03:01:50,100 --> 03:01:53,360
blessing to be their pad distributor or something like that?

2134
03:01:53,360 --> 03:02:01,160
So, they're not a licensed pad, but Konami has, I guess what, didn't Jason Enos say that

2135
03:02:01,160 --> 03:02:03,120
it's the best pad you can get?

2136
03:02:03,120 --> 03:02:05,760
Pretty much, because Konami doesn't really do their own pads anymore.

2137
03:02:05,760 --> 03:02:09,520
They did them like once in a great ass while.

2138
03:02:09,520 --> 03:02:13,120
I've gone right up to Konami and I've gone up to Namco when I go to trade shows and I

2139
03:02:13,120 --> 03:02:17,800
go to manager conferences and I say, hey, why the hell can't we get more Konami brand

2140
03:02:17,800 --> 03:02:19,160
dance pads?

2141
03:02:19,160 --> 03:02:23,880
They go, well, because Konami makes games, we're not a peripheral manufacturer.

2142
03:02:23,880 --> 03:02:28,780
We make enough to promote the sales of the game, and then we let the third parties take

2143
03:02:28,780 --> 03:02:29,780
over.

2144
03:02:29,780 --> 03:02:30,780
Let's talk to Konami style.

2145
03:02:30,780 --> 03:02:35,620
Well, I'm just saying, if it ends up being that it is In the Groove, because, you know,

2146
03:02:35,620 --> 03:02:39,280
it's just kind of the pieces of the puzzle fit together, hmm, Red Octane announces they're

2147
03:02:39,280 --> 03:02:43,260
going to publish a game, hmm, In the Groove says they want to do a home version but is

2148
03:02:43,260 --> 03:02:48,720
looking for a publisher, hmm, hmm, if it all ends up adding together, it would be very

2149
03:02:48,720 --> 03:02:52,040
Very interesting to see what that effect has on Red Octane's relationship with Konami.

2150
03:02:52,040 --> 03:02:53,040
It won't matter.

2151
03:02:53,040 --> 03:02:54,040
Really?

2152
03:02:54,040 --> 03:02:55,040
Yeah.

2153
03:02:55,040 --> 03:03:02,440
Because again, Red Octane does not operate with the explicit, they don't license Konami.

2154
03:03:02,440 --> 03:03:08,000
That's why the Red Octane pad doesn't look just like what you think a Konami pad would

2155
03:03:08,000 --> 03:03:09,000
look like.

2156
03:03:09,000 --> 03:03:10,000
It looks real similar.

2157
03:03:10,000 --> 03:03:11,000
Right.

2158
03:03:11,000 --> 03:03:12,000
But it looks different.

2159
03:03:12,000 --> 03:03:13,840
It's a totally different sort of thing.

2160
03:03:13,840 --> 03:03:17,320
Just because Konami says, yeah, these pads don't suck.

2161
03:03:17,320 --> 03:03:24,420
You know, wouldn't it suck if, you know, the official Konami manufacturer was Mad Catz?

2162
03:03:24,420 --> 03:03:25,420
That would be true.

2163
03:03:25,420 --> 03:03:26,420
No.

2164
03:03:26,420 --> 03:03:29,020
Konami's gonna say, hey, look, you can get dance pads from any of these companies out

2165
03:03:29,020 --> 03:03:34,840
there because it saves them having to make them, but it still lets their products sell.

2166
03:03:34,840 --> 03:03:39,220
So they may as well say that somebody's the best, and apparently that was Red Octane.

2167
03:03:39,220 --> 03:03:47,980
Well, it'll just be interesting to see how things heat up when In the Groove does possibly

2168
03:03:47,980 --> 03:03:48,980
find the publisher.

2169
03:03:48,980 --> 03:03:51,420
Does In the Groove use a different pad layout?

2170
03:03:51,420 --> 03:03:52,980
No, it's the same pad layout.

2171
03:03:52,980 --> 03:03:55,060
Then why would it end?

2172
03:03:55,060 --> 03:03:56,820
Because it's competition for Konami.

2173
03:03:56,820 --> 03:04:00,500
It's not competition for Konami.

2174
03:04:00,500 --> 03:04:04,940
It's like if I went out and I made a flip cartoon and tried to put it up against The

2175
03:04:04,940 --> 03:04:05,940
Incredibles.

2176
03:04:05,940 --> 03:04:10,940
I'd get crushed! Crushed!

2177
03:04:10,940 --> 03:04:13,940
Well, I mean, we'll see what happens. We'll see what happens.

2178
03:04:13,940 --> 03:04:14,940
Yeah.

2179
03:04:14,940 --> 03:04:18,940
Alright, anyway, we gotta wrap it up, though. We gotta go around and get everybody's final thoughts, because it's time to wrap up the show.

2180
03:04:18,940 --> 03:04:20,940
Dan, your final thought.

2181
03:04:20,940 --> 03:04:25,940
Red Ox and Ignition pads. GameStop on Marconi. Come and get them.

2182
03:04:25,940 --> 03:04:30,940
Loki, your final thought.

2183
03:04:30,940 --> 03:04:39,760
outside except if it's a game stop the red octane ignition pads because you

2184
03:04:39,760 --> 03:04:48,840
know what you need you need to buy them plus they're comfy to sit on my final

2185
03:04:48,840 --> 03:05:00,260
thought is I want a beer I want a beer to not spill on my new ignition pad that

2186
03:05:00,260 --> 03:05:08,940
bought for the GameStop on Marconi. Jamie, your final thought. Ouch. I need an ignition

2187
03:05:08,940 --> 03:05:16,900
pad for my pain. From GameStop. From GameStop. On Marconi. On Marconi and Fulton. Alright.

2188
03:05:16,900 --> 03:05:22,660
Final word of the show. One word and one word only to wrap it all up. Sum up tonight's show

2189
03:05:22,660 --> 03:05:29,620
in one word. You know I gotta give it to Dan. Dan, what is tonight's final word? Goodnight

2190
03:05:29,620 --> 03:05:33,900
Metalhead.

2191
03:05:33,900 --> 03:05:39,620
