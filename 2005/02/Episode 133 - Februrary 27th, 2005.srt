00:07:42,116 --> 00:07:42,996
[SPEAKER_15]: Fuck the Oscars.

00:07:44,056 --> 00:07:48,178
[SPEAKER_15]: The Oscar goes to me for being so great.

25
00:07:49,018 --> 00:07:52,199
[SPEAKER_11]: Also joining us... I'm sorry, you can't win the Oscar because you didn't get naked.

26
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:53,779
[SPEAKER_15]: I did not get naked this year.

27
00:07:54,099 --> 00:07:55,820
[SPEAKER_15]: I might tonight, however.

28
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:57,060
[SPEAKER_11]: No.

29
00:07:58,781 --> 00:08:00,722
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm getting the old thumbs up from our special guest.

00:08:00,982 --> 00:08:04,923
[SPEAKER_15]: Who we will get to momentarily after we introduce... Loki, TechMassa.

31
00:08:05,343 --> 00:08:07,604
[SPEAKER_21]: I have corn on one side and rice on the other.

32
00:08:09,437 --> 00:08:11,879
[SPEAKER_15]: That sounds like a very interesting porno I want.

33
00:08:11,939 --> 00:08:12,299
[SPEAKER_15]: Never mind.

34
00:08:16,962 --> 00:08:29,890
[SPEAKER_15]: Also joining us tonight, say hello to our very special guest, who, believe it or not, in 133 weeks of Orange Lounge Radio, has never been to a live show, I do not believe.

35
00:08:29,970 --> 00:08:30,130
[SPEAKER_15]: No?

36
00:08:30,230 --> 00:08:31,051
[SPEAKER_15]: Was there one other time?

37
00:08:32,111 --> 00:08:35,393
[SPEAKER_11]: There was the tournament, and then there was when I did it at the house.

38
00:08:36,034 --> 00:08:36,134
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh.

39
00:08:36,969 --> 00:08:40,051
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, but that's never been here at the Orange Lounge Studios.

40
00:08:40,071 --> 00:08:40,532
[SPEAKER_11]: No, not here.

41
00:08:41,793 --> 00:08:41,973
[SPEAKER_15]: Alright.

42
00:08:42,153 --> 00:08:43,234
[SPEAKER_15]: So make sure the mic's on, bud.

43
00:08:43,614 --> 00:08:45,315
[SPEAKER_15]: Make sure it's in the on position.

44
00:08:45,516 --> 00:08:45,776
[SPEAKER_15]: Really?

45
00:08:46,016 --> 00:08:46,857
[SPEAKER_11]: Into the microphone.

46
00:08:46,877 --> 00:08:47,337
[SPEAKER_15]: Hello.

47
00:08:47,537 --> 00:08:48,138
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, there you go.

48
00:08:48,258 --> 00:08:49,839
[SPEAKER_15]: Say hello to Dan!

49
00:08:52,441 --> 00:08:54,622
[SPEAKER_15]: And why is Dan so special, DarkSakura?

50
00:08:56,124 --> 00:08:57,385
[SPEAKER_11]: Uh, because we're getting married one day.

51
00:08:57,405 --> 00:08:58,846
[SPEAKER_11]: Because I rock.

52
00:08:59,726 --> 00:09:01,908
[SPEAKER_15]: Dan is DarkSakura's hetero life mate.

53
00:09:02,842 --> 00:09:04,763
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, my head went like this.

54
00:09:06,103 --> 00:09:11,665
[SPEAKER_15]: So this should be a very interesting show because now I have someone to gang up on Jamie with.

55
00:09:11,705 --> 00:09:12,766
[SPEAKER_15]: This is going to be fantastic.

56
00:09:13,066 --> 00:09:17,367
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, but when we get home, Dan's ass is going to be kicked.

57
00:09:17,387 --> 00:09:20,148
[SPEAKER_04]: You'd like to think that, wouldn't you?

58
00:09:20,188 --> 00:09:21,168
[SPEAKER_11]: He got second five.

59
00:09:21,228 --> 00:09:21,809
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll school you.

60
00:09:23,382 --> 00:09:27,125
[SPEAKER_15]: Loki, you're too busy eating on this show always to make fun of Jamie with me.

61
00:09:27,145 --> 00:09:27,665
[SPEAKER_15]: No, I'm kidding.

62
00:09:28,186 --> 00:09:30,988
[SPEAKER_15]: I can't make fun of Jamie because she kicks my ass and makes me cry.

63
00:09:32,929 --> 00:09:37,973
[SPEAKER_15]: Anyway, we will be back shortly after a quick break to kick things off in tonight's show.

64
00:09:38,474 --> 00:09:42,817
[SPEAKER_15]: During tonight's show, by the way, we're going to have a brand new song premiere for you guys.

65
00:09:43,297 --> 00:09:46,119
[SPEAKER_15]: Those of you guys with Xboxes, I'm sure you already heard this one.

66
00:09:46,159 --> 00:09:48,761
[SPEAKER_15]: It's the brand new In My Eyes mix from Song Pack 8.

67
00:09:49,402 --> 00:09:51,984
[SPEAKER_15]: But if you haven't had a chance to hear it yet, you're going to.

68
00:09:52,697 --> 00:09:56,282

00:16:20,337 --> 00:16:22,518
[SPEAKER_06]: No!

81
00:16:22,598 --> 00:16:23,258
[SPEAKER_15]: Just kidding.

82
00:16:23,699 --> 00:16:24,739

00:16:24,819 --> 00:16:26,420

00:16:32,685 --> 00:16:33,325
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you for watching!

86
00:17:01,058 --> 00:17:02,579
[SPEAKER_15]: I'd like to accept this award.

87
00:17:03,859 --> 00:17:05,780
[SPEAKER_15]: And I'd like to thank my mother and my father.

88
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:07,341
[SPEAKER_11]: This world is shit!

89
00:17:09,241 --> 00:17:11,582
[SPEAKER_15]: That was the best acceptance speech of all time.

90
00:17:11,983 --> 00:17:15,504
[SPEAKER_15]: When Fiona Apple got up there and said, she was drunk off her ass.

91
00:17:15,544 --> 00:17:18,625
[SPEAKER_15]: This is like what the MTV Awards, what, like 10 years ago almost at this point?

92
00:17:18,965 --> 00:17:21,426
[SPEAKER_15]: She gets up there, oh my god, was that really 10 years ago?

93
00:17:22,127 --> 00:17:22,387
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

94
00:17:22,627 --> 00:17:24,448
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm so old!

95
00:17:25,088 --> 00:17:27,149
[SPEAKER_11]: I was living here when it happened.

96
00:17:27,409 --> 00:17:28,089
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, okay, good.

97
00:17:29,230 --> 00:17:29,450
[SPEAKER_11]: Phew.

98
00:17:29,470 --> 00:17:30,050
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, maybe...

99
00:17:30,819 --> 00:17:31,139
[SPEAKER_11]: Jamey

100
00:17:59,878 --> 00:18:00,419
[SPEAKER_15]: Start us off.

101
00:18:00,459 --> 00:18:00,919
[SPEAKER_15]: How was your week?

102
00:18:00,939 --> 00:18:01,320
[SPEAKER_15]: How was your day?

103
00:18:16,111 --> 00:18:17,632
[SPEAKER_11]: I know, I'm just... We need to fix this.

104
00:18:19,753 --> 00:18:34,442
[SPEAKER_15]: This is why I can't watch the Oscars, even though they call it the Gay Man Super Bowl, and if you hadn't heard the little rumor going around about me, even though they call it the Gay Man Super Bowl, I can't watch this program because I don't see any of the movies, like ever.

105
00:18:35,302 --> 00:18:40,105
[SPEAKER_15]: I think this year I've seen two of the movies, which is like more than ever.

106
00:18:41,506 --> 00:18:43,307
[SPEAKER_11]: I would have to second that.

107
00:18:43,407 --> 00:18:44,988
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't really go to the movies that much anymore.

108
00:18:45,069 --> 00:18:47,690
[SPEAKER_15]: And when I do go to the movies, I usually see like foreign shit.

109
00:18:48,491 --> 00:18:51,113
[SPEAKER_11]: I usually pick a movie and then see it a bajillion times.

110
00:18:51,153 --> 00:18:52,734
[SPEAKER_11]: Like, I saw Phantom of the Opera twice.

111
00:18:55,335 --> 00:18:59,198
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, see, I saw Rocky Horror Picture Show like 200 and something times.

112
00:19:00,198 --> 00:19:05,702
[SPEAKER_21]: If I have to see another period piece starring Leonardo DiCaprio, I am going to scream.

113
00:19:08,304 --> 00:19:09,905
[SPEAKER_15]: Or fucking Dame Judi Dench.

114
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:13,882
[SPEAKER_15]: Dame Judi Dench in every period piece there ever was.

115
00:19:13,923 --> 00:19:15,103
[SPEAKER_15]: There's Dame Judi Dench.

116
00:19:15,444 --> 00:19:18,786
[SPEAKER_15]: Don't get me wrong, Dame Judi Dench is a great actress, but damn.

117
00:19:19,767 --> 00:19:20,127
[SPEAKER_11]: My week.

118
00:19:20,528 --> 00:19:21,048
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh yeah, sorry.

119
00:19:22,149 --> 00:19:23,630
[SPEAKER_11]: My week was spent in a coma.

120
00:19:25,331 --> 00:19:29,474
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, more like being half in a coma and half playing Final Fantasy XI.

121
00:19:30,055 --> 00:19:32,457
[SPEAKER_11]: Because I did not have the energy to move out of my chair.

122
00:19:34,518 --> 00:19:35,379
[SPEAKER_21]: It'll do that to you.

123
00:19:36,540 --> 00:19:36,700
[SPEAKER_11]: No.

124
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:36,760
[SPEAKER_11]: No.

125
00:19:37,666 --> 00:19:40,808
[SPEAKER_11]: I, um, I basically ran a fever.

126
00:19:41,228 --> 00:19:42,709
[SPEAKER_11]: The highest it was when I checked was 103.

127
00:19:42,969 --> 00:19:49,413
[SPEAKER_11]: And, uh, it's like Friday, like Saturday, I stopped running a fever.

128
00:19:50,353 --> 00:19:51,193
[SPEAKER_11]: I went to the doctor.

129
00:19:51,574 --> 00:19:53,575
[SPEAKER_11]: She said, your ass ain't going to work.

130
00:19:54,795 --> 00:20:06,922
[SPEAKER_11]: And basically I had some type of viral infection that almost became, she said that it was leaving me very open to bacteria and that it was basically settled in my sinuses and the head.

131
00:20:07,762 --> 00:20:08,202
[SPEAKER_11]: Microphone.

132
00:20:37,968 --> 00:20:43,670
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, and, uh, yeah.

133
00:20:43,690 --> 00:20:46,192
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, and, uh, what else did I do?

134
00:20:46,252 --> 00:20:49,213
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, yeah, yesterday we cleaned our room and found the floor.

135
00:20:50,593 --> 00:20:52,554
[SPEAKER_11]: We threw away, like, two years worth of crap.

136
00:20:54,455 --> 00:20:58,296
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, I got disconnected from the chat room.

137
00:20:59,677 --> 00:21:00,137
[SPEAKER_10]: Shut up!

138
00:21:02,018 --> 00:21:06,600
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, but I also, uh,

139
00:21:08,611 --> 00:21:09,592
[SPEAKER_11]: What else did I do?

140
00:21:10,633 --> 00:21:13,394
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh yeah, today we went and bought like lots of stuff.

141
00:21:14,675 --> 00:21:15,416
[SPEAKER_11]: And had dinner.

142
00:21:15,436 --> 00:21:16,436
[SPEAKER_11]: And that was it.

143
00:21:16,656 --> 00:21:17,397
[SPEAKER_11]: And it got second five!

144
00:21:19,578 --> 00:21:23,121
[SPEAKER_11]: Which is, even though I haven't played the home version yet, the most awesome game in the world.

145
00:21:25,502 --> 00:21:25,822
[SPEAKER_11]: That's it.

146
00:21:27,283 --> 00:21:28,324
[SPEAKER_15]: Alright, Loki!

147
00:21:29,625 --> 00:21:31,046
[SPEAKER_15]: I know you're trying to eat, but it's your turn.

148
00:21:31,086 --> 00:21:31,546
[SPEAKER_15]: How was your week?

149
00:21:31,566 --> 00:21:32,066
[SPEAKER_15]: How was your day?

150
00:21:32,647 --> 00:21:35,949
[SPEAKER_21]: So anyways... I was chewing...

151
00:21:37,341 --> 00:21:38,321
[SPEAKER_21]: and then stuff happened.

152
00:21:39,041 --> 00:21:39,181
[SPEAKER_21]: No.

153
00:21:41,742 --> 00:21:45,683
[SPEAKER_21]: Right now, since I had sort of like lunch for breakfast, I'm having breakfast for dinner.

154
00:21:46,543 --> 00:21:48,204
[SPEAKER_21]: You know, just to kind of balance things out.

155
00:21:48,284 --> 00:21:49,924
[SPEAKER_15]: You're having a dyslexic meal day.

156
00:21:51,044 --> 00:21:51,624
[SPEAKER_21]: Exactly.

157
00:21:52,945 --> 00:21:55,785
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm having, you know, it's actually pretty good for me.

158
00:21:56,105 --> 00:21:56,766
[SPEAKER_21]: Crispix.

159
00:21:57,886 --> 00:21:58,686
[SPEAKER_13]: It's damn good.

160
00:21:58,986 --> 00:22:01,887
[SPEAKER_13]: And, you know, I've already eaten half the box.

161
00:22:02,207 --> 00:22:02,967
[SPEAKER_13]: Holy crap.

162
00:22:03,867 --> 00:22:04,707
[SPEAKER_13]: There's not much in there.

163
00:22:05,928 --> 00:22:06,848
[SPEAKER_21]: Anyways, um,

164
00:22:07,418 --> 00:22:08,879
[SPEAKER_21]: So, yeah, this week, what did I do?

165
00:22:09,059 --> 00:22:12,460
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay, to start things off, first off, computer was out of commission.

166
00:22:12,700 --> 00:22:14,300
[SPEAKER_13]: We do remember that on Sunday.

167
00:22:15,661 --> 00:22:16,241
[SPEAKER_13]: It was gone.

168
00:22:16,261 --> 00:22:21,223
[SPEAKER_13]: I was like, you know, I can wait a week until I get paid next to fix it.

169
00:22:21,743 --> 00:22:24,004
[SPEAKER_13]: It's okay.

170
00:22:24,084 --> 00:22:26,965
[SPEAKER_13]: The next day... So, I watched Robot Chicken.

171
00:22:27,485 --> 00:22:29,746
[SPEAKER_13]: Robot Chicken is fucking hilarious.

172
00:22:29,846 --> 00:22:32,326
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't normally endorse television programs.

173
00:22:32,386 --> 00:22:34,787
[SPEAKER_15]: However, I will endorse Robot Chicken.

174
00:22:34,947 --> 00:22:35,307
[SPEAKER_13]: Tonight, 11.30.

175
00:22:35,548 --> 00:22:36,848
[SPEAKER_15]: Fucking comedy.

176
00:22:37,954 --> 00:22:40,396
[SPEAKER_15]: Cartoon Network, Best 15 Minutes of Your Life

177
00:23:01,514 --> 00:23:07,179
[SPEAKER_21]: I honestly, I'm glad it was only 15 minutes long, because I was laughing so hard, I probably would have passed out if it was any longer.

178
00:23:07,299 --> 00:23:08,760
[SPEAKER_21]: So, it was great.

179
00:23:10,161 --> 00:23:17,848
[SPEAKER_13]: Then, because remember, you have organic internal organs, and you can get cancer.

180
00:23:19,409 --> 00:23:19,710
[SPEAKER_13]: Anyways.

181
00:23:22,147 --> 00:23:24,949
[SPEAKER_15]: Everybody who saw Robot Chicken is kind of chuckling.

182
00:23:24,969 --> 00:23:27,591
[SPEAKER_15]: They're not really laughing because it wasn't that funny, but they're chuckling a little bit.

183
00:23:27,911 --> 00:23:30,993
[SPEAKER_15]: Anybody who didn't see it is going, Loki, shut up.

184
00:23:31,694 --> 00:23:32,795
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't get you.

185
00:23:34,136 --> 00:23:43,742
[SPEAKER_21]: So anyway, the rest of the week was filled with watching... Well, actually just playing Final Fantasy XI.

186
00:23:44,763 --> 00:23:50,807
[SPEAKER_21]: And I tried actually playing Final Fantasy XII, but then I realized that for some reason...

187
00:23:51,673 --> 00:23:52,514
[SPEAKER_21]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

188
00:24:18,499 --> 00:24:26,146
[SPEAKER_15]: I actually played the guy game last night with Loki and his girlfriend and one of Loki's other friends.

189
00:24:26,847 --> 00:24:30,890
[SPEAKER_15]: And my friend Christopher was just kind of sitting in the corner playing DS going, what's wrong with you people?

190
00:24:31,651 --> 00:24:32,812
[SPEAKER_15]: But I was playing the guy game.

191
00:24:33,813 --> 00:24:35,895
[SPEAKER_15]: I owned at the guy game.

192
00:24:36,295 --> 00:24:37,056
[SPEAKER_15]: I'd just like to point out.

193
00:24:37,997 --> 00:24:38,878
[SPEAKER_11]: Did you get boobies?

194
00:24:39,818 --> 00:24:42,100
[SPEAKER_15]: I got my girl to give me a lap dance at the end.

195
00:24:43,322 --> 00:24:44,823
[SPEAKER_15]: Except my girl looked like a dude.

196
00:24:48,424 --> 00:24:49,305
[SPEAKER_06]: So I was right.

197
00:24:50,866 --> 00:24:54,329
[SPEAKER_15]: But, I mean, she looked okay when it wasn't like a still photo of her.

198
00:24:54,369 --> 00:24:56,531
[SPEAKER_15]: When she was kind of in motion, she looked alright.

199
00:24:57,051 --> 00:24:59,553
[SPEAKER_15]: But the still photos did not do that girl justice.

200
00:24:59,573 --> 00:25:02,135
[SPEAKER_13]: It was like somewhere between Tori Spelling and Bea Arthur.

201
00:25:02,815 --> 00:25:04,637
[SPEAKER_15]: Seriously, there was this one picture of her.

202
00:25:05,518 --> 00:25:07,139
[SPEAKER_15]: What was the name of the model in the game?

203
00:25:07,499 --> 00:25:08,040
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't remember.

204
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:10,021
[SPEAKER_17]: She's the one that looks like a horse.

205
00:25:11,322 --> 00:25:12,923
[SPEAKER_17]: We didn't know Chyna was in the guy game.

206
00:25:15,245 --> 00:25:16,086
[SPEAKER_17]: So anyways, yes.

207
00:25:16,445 --> 00:25:17,045
[SPEAKER_13]: So we did that.

208
00:25:17,165 --> 00:25:23,969
[SPEAKER_13]: I went and played some horse crack because I had to get rid of some of my tokens left over from that horrible place called Golfland.

209
00:25:24,790 --> 00:25:28,211
[SPEAKER_13]: And I still, you know, my boycott still exists.

210
00:25:28,251 --> 00:25:32,754
[SPEAKER_13]: I just have to get rid of these tokens so that I'm rid of their evil.

211
00:25:34,015 --> 00:25:38,817
[SPEAKER_13]: But I have to say, I eat children, my horse, in derby crack.

212
00:25:39,618 --> 00:25:40,198
[SPEAKER_13]: Kickin' ass.

213
00:25:40,878 --> 00:25:43,920
[SPEAKER_21]: And what else did I do?

214
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:45,121
[SPEAKER_21]: Well, that's pretty much it.

215
00:25:45,261 --> 00:25:45,801
[SPEAKER_21]: Just kind of

216
00:25:46,283 --> 00:25:51,125
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, I retired a horse, like, in two days.

217
00:25:52,545 --> 00:25:54,406
[SPEAKER_11]: When they got Doc over there.

218
00:25:55,206 --> 00:25:56,107
[SPEAKER_15]: This is so weird.

219
00:25:56,127 --> 00:26:00,468
[SPEAKER_15]: I haven't really been to Golf Land in, like, I don't know, four months.

220
00:26:01,169 --> 00:26:05,110
[SPEAKER_15]: I hear Country Club Lanes has In The Groove, but I'm too lazy to go over there and play it.

221
00:26:05,879 --> 00:26:07,360
[SPEAKER_15]: What the hell am I doing this show for?

222
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:08,160
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know.

223
00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:11,141
[SPEAKER_13]: But, honestly, they had a new Sega shooter there.

224
00:26:11,181 --> 00:26:12,001
[SPEAKER_13]: That was kind of neat.

225
00:26:12,201 --> 00:26:13,162
[SPEAKER_11]: That game is awesome.

226
00:26:13,582 --> 00:26:14,822
[SPEAKER_13]: I didn't actually get to see it.

227
00:26:15,003 --> 00:26:15,323
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.

228
00:26:15,543 --> 00:26:16,623
[SPEAKER_11]: That game is really fun.

229
00:26:16,663 --> 00:26:17,343
[SPEAKER_11]: Dan and I played it.

230
00:26:17,684 --> 00:26:19,224
[SPEAKER_13]: I didn't really get to play anything else.

231
00:26:19,624 --> 00:26:26,287
[SPEAKER_13]: No, I'm really just, you know, DDR is kind of getting old as far as, you know, there's not been really new coming out.

232
00:26:26,827 --> 00:26:30,268
[SPEAKER_13]: And I'm starting to, like, take interest in the other arcade games again.

233
00:26:30,308 --> 00:26:31,629
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, back, you know, where...

234
00:26:32,102 --> 00:26:39,583
[SPEAKER_13]: When I was in the DDRs, kind of like, other arcade games, eh, fuck them, you know, I'm just playing DDR, you know, where now... DDR's got a line.

235
00:26:40,984 --> 00:26:42,064
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, that was it, actually.

236
00:26:42,084 --> 00:26:44,464
[SPEAKER_21]: There was a ton of people standing around the damn thing.

237
00:26:44,944 --> 00:26:46,985
[SPEAKER_15]: Is DDR going through a renaissance right now?

238
00:26:47,045 --> 00:26:49,885
[SPEAKER_15]: Because, like, there's fucking tons of people always playing it.

239
00:26:50,325 --> 00:26:53,626
[SPEAKER_15]: When I'm actually, when I am at an arcade... No one's playing Derby Owners Club at all.

240
00:26:54,326 --> 00:26:56,506
[SPEAKER_15]: Maybe one other person, that's why I came in second and third.

241
00:26:56,686 --> 00:26:59,987
[SPEAKER_15]: Extreme is what, like, two and a half years old now, and it's still...

242
00:27:01,394 --> 00:27:02,355
[SPEAKER_15]: Getting these huge crowds.

243
00:27:03,135 --> 00:27:03,756
[SPEAKER_21]: And Max too.

244
00:27:03,856 --> 00:27:04,276
[SPEAKER_15]: Crazy.

245
00:27:04,316 --> 00:27:05,697
[SPEAKER_21]: There is more people on Max too.

246
00:27:06,078 --> 00:27:09,620
[SPEAKER_21]: Probably that's because the extreme pads are fucked up.

247
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:11,602
[SPEAKER_13]: I went and played Guitar Freaks yesterday.

248
00:27:12,842 --> 00:27:17,246
[SPEAKER_13]: One, my left hand hurt like a bitch because I'm just not used to playing it anymore.

249
00:27:17,826 --> 00:27:21,689
[SPEAKER_13]: Guess I gotta start masturbating with my left hand now, you know, to get it used to that kind of stuff.

250
00:27:22,069 --> 00:27:26,292
[SPEAKER_13]: But their fucking green button on there was messed up.

251
00:27:26,513 --> 00:27:27,093
[SPEAKER_13]: It was like...

252
00:27:27,897 --> 00:27:30,018
[SPEAKER_13]: Damn that fucking green button!

253
00:27:30,038 --> 00:27:32,798
[SPEAKER_13]: Seriously, I was failing songs because of it!

254
00:27:33,598 --> 00:27:34,258
[SPEAKER_13]: Fuck them!

255
00:27:34,779 --> 00:27:35,919
[SPEAKER_13]: And their crappy stuff.

256
00:27:36,439 --> 00:27:44,181
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, I guess, you know, they got tired of... They wanted to save money, apparently, because, you know, after all, they ripped me off on money, so why not?

257
00:27:44,341 --> 00:27:45,841
[SPEAKER_13]: Let's just not fix anything.

258
00:27:46,881 --> 00:27:53,403
[SPEAKER_15]: I hear they're actually gonna get a fourth DDR machine, which'll be in the groove, so... That's rumored.

259
00:27:54,503 --> 00:27:55,383
[SPEAKER_21]: Fuck them, anyways.

260
00:27:56,067 --> 00:28:01,905
[SPEAKER_21]: It's another machine they won't maintain I'm done Well

261
00:28:02,816 --> 00:28:04,937
[SPEAKER_15]: My week and my day was pretty good.

262
00:28:04,997 --> 00:28:10,298
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, gosh, Loki already kind of hit on some of the stuff I wanted to talk about, like the guy game thing going on last night.

263
00:28:10,358 --> 00:28:11,018
[SPEAKER_15]: That was kind of fun.

264
00:28:11,738 --> 00:28:18,200
[SPEAKER_15]: And, you know, just kind of went out earlier this week, and I've been busy with work, though.

265
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:20,861
[SPEAKER_15]: It's had me really exhausted, so I've been just napping a whole lot.

266
00:28:21,241 --> 00:28:26,022
[SPEAKER_15]: Been playing a lot of Final Fantasy XI, of course, and boy, did I just hit my point of frustration today.

267
00:28:26,883 --> 00:28:28,003
[SPEAKER_15]: I just want to quit that game.

268
00:28:29,932 --> 00:28:30,612
[SPEAKER_15]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

269
00:28:52,233 --> 00:28:53,574
[SPEAKER_15]: Final Fantasy II Final Fantasy II

270
00:29:09,775 --> 00:29:13,897
[SPEAKER_15]: But I got sick of Final Fantasy 1, so I want to get back into Final Fantasy 2 and see what it's really all about.

271
00:29:14,577 --> 00:29:17,118
[SPEAKER_15]: Because I know very little about the game and the story.

272
00:29:17,218 --> 00:29:18,719
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, I know bits and pieces here and there.

273
00:29:19,059 --> 00:29:24,982
[SPEAKER_15]: And I recognized the song in the beginning, because everybody knows that Imperial March song that's in Final Fantasy 2.

274
00:29:26,422 --> 00:29:27,003
[SPEAKER_15]: So that was cool.

275
00:29:28,403 --> 00:29:31,605
[SPEAKER_15]: And, gosh, outside of that, not really a whole lot.

276
00:29:33,045 --> 00:29:35,866
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm not that exciting this week, or any week, to be honest.

277
00:29:36,327 --> 00:29:36,927
[SPEAKER_15]: It's kind of sad.

278
00:29:39,085 --> 00:29:39,665
[SPEAKER_15]: Let's move on.

279
00:29:40,186 --> 00:29:43,848
[SPEAKER_17]: Dan, would you like to share with us how your week is and how your day is going and all that stuff?

280
00:29:45,289 --> 00:29:47,070
[SPEAKER_17]: I had to deal with a sick Jamie all week.

281
00:29:47,970 --> 00:29:50,872
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm sure you can all relate with how much fun that is.

282
00:29:50,992 --> 00:29:53,113
[SPEAKER_17]: Do you give her a bell when she's sick?

283
00:29:53,173 --> 00:29:54,294
[SPEAKER_17]: Like she can ring a bell?

284
00:29:54,574 --> 00:29:55,815
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, that's all she needs.

285
00:29:57,716 --> 00:29:59,117
[SPEAKER_20]: Another way to make more noise.

286
00:30:01,362 --> 00:30:02,483
[SPEAKER_18]: No, actually, it was pretty good.

287
00:30:02,523 --> 00:30:09,185
[SPEAKER_18]: I took a bunch of days off this week, which turned out to be good timing, because even though she was sick, it let me spend a lot of time at home with Jamie, and we had fun.

288
00:30:10,165 --> 00:30:12,386
[SPEAKER_20]: Aww.

289
00:30:12,846 --> 00:30:16,408
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, you know, I managed to get her to clean the bedroom, which, you know, five years.

290
00:30:16,528 --> 00:30:18,328
[SPEAKER_18]: Not two years, five years.

291
00:30:18,729 --> 00:30:22,130
[SPEAKER_18]: We unpacked stuff I hadn't seen since I packed it before we moved into that apartment.

292
00:30:22,190 --> 00:30:22,690
[SPEAKER_18]: It was bad.

293
00:30:24,350 --> 00:30:27,092
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm going to be moving in April and I'm very much dreading it.

294
00:30:27,992 --> 00:30:29,173
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh god, it's going to suck.

295
00:30:29,994 --> 00:30:32,515
[SPEAKER_15]: I swear to god I'm going to call 1-800-JUNK.

296
00:30:32,536 --> 00:30:33,876
[SPEAKER_15]: 1-800-GARBAGE.

297
00:30:33,896 --> 00:30:35,037
[SPEAKER_15]: 1-800-GET-JUNK or whatever it is.

298
00:30:35,818 --> 00:30:37,319
[SPEAKER_15]: GOT-JUNK.

299
00:30:37,339 --> 00:30:38,060
[SPEAKER_18]: 1-800-GOT-TOLD.

300
00:30:39,461 --> 00:30:42,923
[SPEAKER_18]: Haven't had a lot of chance to do a lot of gaming, which is kind of bizarre since I've been at home all week.

301
00:30:44,244 --> 00:30:49,348
[SPEAKER_18]: Sucks, but hey, what are you going to do?

302
00:30:49,608 --> 00:30:50,929
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh yeah, it's cool, it's cool.

303
00:30:52,941 --> 00:30:57,144
[SPEAKER_15]: GameStop, Marconi, buy all your Dance Dance stuff from us.

304
00:31:23,380 --> 00:31:25,561
[SPEAKER_18]: I have like 15 ignition pads, okay?

305
00:31:25,721 --> 00:31:26,982
[SPEAKER_18]: I need somebody to buy them.

306
00:31:27,442 --> 00:31:33,765
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm coming on this show because I need you guys to buy ignition pads from the GameStop on Marconi.

307
00:31:34,005 --> 00:31:35,886
[SPEAKER_18]: You go to any other GameStop, it doesn't fucking help me.

308
00:31:37,427 --> 00:31:39,308
[SPEAKER_18]: You gotta buy them from me, please.

309
00:31:39,468 --> 00:31:40,668
[SPEAKER_18]: I sold five in one week.

310
00:31:41,088 --> 00:31:43,209
[SPEAKER_18]: The company said, oh, fuck, these things are hot.

311
00:31:43,389 --> 00:31:46,071
[SPEAKER_18]: Sent me like seven cases of them.

312
00:31:46,531 --> 00:31:47,551
[SPEAKER_18]: There's two per case.

313
00:31:48,472 --> 00:31:49,372
[SPEAKER_18]: I can't get rid of them.

314
00:31:50,033 --> 00:31:50,353
[SPEAKER_18]: They're $100 a piece.

315
00:31:51,488 --> 00:31:52,969
[SPEAKER_18]: I saw the $20 ones, like, they're going out of style.

316
00:31:53,049 --> 00:31:54,230
[SPEAKER_18]: Someone buy an ignition pad, please.

317
00:31:55,150 --> 00:31:57,331
[SPEAKER_17]: You know, I went to GameStop to buy an ignition pad once.

318
00:31:57,351 --> 00:31:57,811
[SPEAKER_17]: It wasn't yours.

319
00:31:58,272 --> 00:32:00,233
[SPEAKER_17]: Um, but... Yeah, yeah, yeah.

320
00:32:00,453 --> 00:32:01,293
[SPEAKER_17]: You see how that works?

321
00:32:01,774 --> 00:32:02,134
[SPEAKER_15]: Fucker.

322
00:32:03,114 --> 00:32:05,215
[SPEAKER_18]: Are you doing another GameStop to buy an ignition pad?

323
00:32:06,036 --> 00:32:07,036
[SPEAKER_18]: Now I'm taking over your show.

324
00:32:07,377 --> 00:32:09,558
[SPEAKER_15]: I needed an ignition pad now.

325
00:32:09,678 --> 00:32:10,999
[SPEAKER_15]: At least I went to GameStop.

326
00:32:12,519 --> 00:32:12,780
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah.

327
00:32:13,320 --> 00:32:14,601
[SPEAKER_17]: Because that really helps me.

328
00:32:15,221 --> 00:32:15,601
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm sorry.

329
00:32:15,621 --> 00:32:17,522
[SPEAKER_17]: I thought there was this whole corporate synergy thing going on.

330
00:32:17,542 --> 00:32:18,903
[SPEAKER_18]: At least I supported your opposition.

331
00:32:18,923 --> 00:32:20,043
[SPEAKER_18]: You see, they make us compete.

332
00:32:20,083 --> 00:32:20,984
[SPEAKER_18]: We fight to the death.

333
00:32:21,997 --> 00:32:26,781
[SPEAKER_18]: And I usually win because, let's be honest, the rest of the GameStop managers in this area, posers.

334
00:32:27,942 --> 00:32:32,746
[SPEAKER_18]: But really, by Ignition Pad, GameStop, Marconi and Fulton.

335
00:32:32,786 --> 00:32:34,327
[SPEAKER_15]: Marconi and Fulton, yes.

336
00:32:34,387 --> 00:32:37,750
[SPEAKER_15]: So if you disagree with Dan's comments, come see him in person.

337
00:32:37,770 --> 00:32:38,310
[SPEAKER_15]: Come on by.

338
00:32:38,330 --> 00:32:40,932
[SPEAKER_18]: I mean, I'm already on the webcam.

339
00:32:40,952 --> 00:32:41,653
[SPEAKER_18]: You know what I look like.

340
00:32:41,673 --> 00:32:42,834
[SPEAKER_18]: You ain't going to miss me.

341
00:32:45,436 --> 00:32:49,399
[SPEAKER_18]: If you're in the Sacramento area, you are hereby obligated to shop at my store.

342
00:32:50,228 --> 00:32:53,210
[SPEAKER_18]: Get all this Dance Dance crap out of my store.

343
00:32:54,110 --> 00:32:56,272
[SPEAKER_18]: I'll get new Dance Dance crap and that's fine.

344
00:32:58,833 --> 00:33:05,097
[SPEAKER_15]: You know, I went into your competing game stop once and I went and bought a new ignition pad.

345
00:33:05,457 --> 00:33:11,281
[SPEAKER_14]: And they were like, Whoa, you're actually buying an ignition pad?

346
00:33:12,082 --> 00:33:14,303
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't think I've ever seen anyone buy one.

347
00:33:15,824 --> 00:33:16,404
[SPEAKER_14]: Wow.

348
00:33:17,685 --> 00:33:18,986
[SPEAKER_14]: Are you sure that's what you want?

349
00:33:19,788 --> 00:33:21,949
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm like, way to sell it, buddy, way to sell it.

350
00:33:22,530 --> 00:33:26,572
[SPEAKER_15]: Aren't you supposed to ask me if I want to pre-order the next fucking pad or something?

351
00:33:26,852 --> 00:33:29,573
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, it's because of my involvement with you guys and with Jamie.

352
00:33:30,073 --> 00:33:33,015
[SPEAKER_18]: I know how shit-hot the ignition pad is supposed to be.

353
00:33:33,155 --> 00:33:37,217
[SPEAKER_18]: I've never used one, but I know it's supposed to be frickin' unbelievable.

354
00:33:38,358 --> 00:33:45,261
[SPEAKER_15]: If you're going to play DDR at home, seriously, at all, you should spend the money and get one.

355
00:33:45,501 --> 00:33:47,823
[SPEAKER_15]: Because the $20 pads ain't worth your time.

356
00:33:48,123 --> 00:33:48,623
[SPEAKER_18]: No, no, they suck.

357
00:33:50,017 --> 00:33:53,620
[SPEAKER_18]: But yeah, so I pimped a bunch of them one week and we were feeling real good about that.

358
00:33:54,341 --> 00:33:56,102
[SPEAKER_18]: Boom rang around, bit me in the ass.

359
00:33:56,262 --> 00:33:57,183
[SPEAKER_18]: Come buy ignition pads.

360
00:33:57,583 --> 00:34:02,087
[SPEAKER_18]: From me, please.

361
00:34:03,068 --> 00:34:05,409
[SPEAKER_21]: I have these pads over here that I don't even use.

362
00:34:07,111 --> 00:34:07,651
[SPEAKER_21]: So sad.

363
00:34:08,212 --> 00:34:09,653
[SPEAKER_18]: Use them with your sick ass arcade machines.

364
00:34:09,935 --> 00:34:11,836
[SPEAKER_21]: I do use them with my sick-ass arcade machine.

365
00:34:12,136 --> 00:34:19,680
[SPEAKER_13]: My problem is the sick-ass static electricity that's created by the sick-ass Lexin that's in there.

366
00:34:19,700 --> 00:34:29,145
[SPEAKER_13]: It kind of fries my sick-ass keyboard encoder board, and that doesn't work very well.

367
00:34:29,526 --> 00:34:29,946
[SPEAKER_18]: Static.

368
00:34:30,226 --> 00:34:30,866
[SPEAKER_18]: It'll stop you.

369
00:34:31,867 --> 00:34:35,449
[SPEAKER_13]: So I need to ground those pads, and then we'll be all good.

370
00:34:37,485 --> 00:34:39,566
[SPEAKER_13]: God damn it, they were expensive enough to build.

371
00:34:40,367 --> 00:34:42,007
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't need to be buying anymore.

372
00:34:43,048 --> 00:34:43,488
[SPEAKER_13]: No more.

373
00:34:45,549 --> 00:34:45,869
[SPEAKER_13]: Anyways.

374
00:34:47,190 --> 00:34:52,372
[SPEAKER_13]: And besides, the whole reason I built the cabinet and these pads is so I didn't have to go back to Golf Land.

375
00:34:52,432 --> 00:34:55,914
[SPEAKER_13]: Now they've just, you know, finalized that by trying to rip me off.

376
00:34:56,494 --> 00:34:58,715
[SPEAKER_13]: So, perfect.

377
00:34:59,156 --> 00:35:00,636
[SPEAKER_13]: It's all coming to play.

378
00:35:00,956 --> 00:35:03,918
[SPEAKER_11]: The purpose of GameStop is to rip people off and kill their soul.

379
00:35:07,922 --> 00:35:10,243
[SPEAKER_15]: We sell the GameStop or MovieStop.

380
00:35:12,144 --> 00:35:12,444
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.

381
00:35:13,284 --> 00:35:13,564
Wait, wait.

382
00:35:13,584 --> 00:35:15,945
[SPEAKER_15]: There's actually a company called MovieStop now?

383
00:35:16,845 --> 00:35:19,226
[SPEAKER_18]: I saw them in Alabama.

384
00:35:19,606 --> 00:35:21,627
[SPEAKER_18]: They're kicking the idea around for out here.

385
00:35:22,007 --> 00:35:28,589
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, and they're buying games, or not games, but they're movies for their GameStops also from us.

386
00:35:28,829 --> 00:35:35,611
[SPEAKER_13]: We have a person that works in my key accounts department that doesn't know shit about anything, and he sells to them.

387
00:35:36,258 --> 00:35:49,546
[SPEAKER_11]: Ironically, when I was in Mobile, there was one right next door to an EB.

388
00:35:51,207 --> 00:35:56,711
[SPEAKER_15]: GameStop, on one hand, is an evil empire, but on the other hand, you need to get rid of those ignition pads, so come to the GameStop.

389
00:35:57,191 --> 00:35:58,632
[SPEAKER_18]: Hey, they're an evil empire, but...

390
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:00,362
[SPEAKER_18]: They pay our bills.

391
00:36:00,442 --> 00:36:01,324
[SPEAKER_18]: At least they're not Walmart.

392
00:36:01,344 --> 00:36:02,366
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, now that's an evil empire.

393
00:36:02,486 --> 00:36:03,228
[SPEAKER_18]: A giant evil empire.

394
00:36:10,956 --> 00:36:16,998
[SPEAKER_15]: You know what, Starbucks is an evil empire too, but that doesn't make Frappuccino's taste any less, you know, yeah, seriously.

395
00:36:17,018 --> 00:36:21,380
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, Starbucks, actually, from what I understand, Starbucks treats its employees pretty well.

396
00:36:21,500 --> 00:36:23,721
[SPEAKER_15]: I know people that work at Starbucks and they have nice things to say about it.

397
00:36:23,741 --> 00:36:26,081
[SPEAKER_18]: My understanding is that Starbucks managers make bank.

398
00:36:26,341 --> 00:36:28,342
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, so Starbucks... Stock options.

399
00:36:28,362 --> 00:36:33,744
[SPEAKER_15]: But yet people hate Starbucks because it's killing all the independent coffee shops or whatever.

400
00:36:33,864 --> 00:36:35,805
[SPEAKER_18]: Dude, did you ever go to an independent coffee shop?

401
00:36:36,972 --> 00:36:37,513
[SPEAKER_18]: No, you didn't.

402
00:36:37,673 --> 00:36:38,433
[SPEAKER_15]: Actually, I did.

403
00:36:38,633 --> 00:36:39,014
[SPEAKER_18]: Shut up.

404
00:36:39,094 --> 00:36:40,735
[SPEAKER_18]: You're screwing up my argument.

405
00:36:40,795 --> 00:36:41,115
[SPEAKER_18]: I did.

406
00:36:41,296 --> 00:36:43,117
[SPEAKER_18]: I did, but... Okay, did you go to it a lot?

407
00:36:43,838 --> 00:36:44,678
[SPEAKER_15]: No, I didn't go to it a lot.

408
00:36:44,718 --> 00:36:45,759
[SPEAKER_18]: Have you gone to Starbucks more?

409
00:36:45,799 --> 00:36:47,881
[SPEAKER_15]: The independent coffee shop did not have a drive-thru.

410
00:36:49,142 --> 00:36:49,402
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah.

411
00:36:49,702 --> 00:37:03,373
[SPEAKER_15]: And that's really the clincher for Starbucks, is that if I can drive home and pick up a mocha latte frappalotta coffee chocino thing... They didn't have drive-thrus, and they weren't in the mall.

412
00:37:04,013 --> 00:37:05,993
[SPEAKER_18]: If you work at the mall, you drink Starbucks.

413
00:37:06,254 --> 00:37:07,814
[SPEAKER_18]: It's because they pump something through the air.

414
00:37:08,634 --> 00:37:11,775
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't drink Starbucks, but when I worked at the mall, I drank Starbucks like a fucking fiend.

415
00:37:11,935 --> 00:37:13,815
[SPEAKER_15]: Could it be the smell of coffee in the air?

416
00:37:14,295 --> 00:37:14,996
[SPEAKER_18]: No, it's not.

417
00:37:15,736 --> 00:37:18,056
[SPEAKER_18]: The mall doesn't smell like... You go to the mall, does it smell like coffee?

418
00:37:18,396 --> 00:37:19,977
[SPEAKER_11]: Subliminal messages in the music.

419
00:37:20,577 --> 00:37:21,097
[SPEAKER_18]: It is funny, though.

420
00:37:21,117 --> 00:37:24,458
[SPEAKER_18]: If you get ice water from Starbucks and you drink it, it tastes like coffee.

421
00:37:26,418 --> 00:37:27,459
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm friggin' serious, man.

422
00:37:27,499 --> 00:37:27,799
[SPEAKER_18]: Try it.

423
00:37:27,999 --> 00:37:28,419
[SPEAKER_18]: Just try it.

424
00:37:29,419 --> 00:37:31,940
[SPEAKER_18]: And they won't turn you down because it's like a corporate mandate from Starbucks.

425
00:37:31,980 --> 00:37:33,580
[SPEAKER_18]: If you ask for water, they gotta give you water.

426
00:37:36,100 --> 00:37:44,828
[SPEAKER_15]: I hate it when I go into places and you ask for water, and this is especially bad at places that have a DDR machine, i.e.

427
00:37:44,948 --> 00:37:46,330
[SPEAKER_15]: Roseville Golf Land.

428
00:37:46,770 --> 00:37:47,170
Sucks!

429
00:37:47,511 --> 00:37:54,337
[SPEAKER_15]: You want to go and you go to play DDR and then you work up a sweat and you want to go get a nice glass of ice water.

430
00:37:55,398 --> 00:37:57,840
[SPEAKER_06]: That'll be 25 cents for the cup.

431
00:37:59,441 --> 00:38:00,242
[SPEAKER_15]: What if you bring your own cup?

432
00:38:02,705 --> 00:38:04,546
[SPEAKER_15]: Then they won't do it.

433
00:38:05,046 --> 00:38:07,368
[SPEAKER_15]: No, probably not, because they'll claim it's unsanitary.

434
00:38:07,548 --> 00:38:08,168
[SPEAKER_15]: I haven't tried it.

435
00:38:08,449 --> 00:38:11,070
[SPEAKER_15]: I just end up going off in a huff to the drinking fountain.

436
00:38:11,450 --> 00:38:13,231
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm like, you bastards, I'm pumping it up.

437
00:38:13,251 --> 00:38:14,612
[SPEAKER_18]: That drinking fountain is scary.

438
00:38:14,772 --> 00:38:16,934
[SPEAKER_18]: It's got, like, gum and, like, tobacco.

439
00:38:16,954 --> 00:38:17,614
[SPEAKER_15]: Seriously.

440
00:38:17,674 --> 00:38:18,435
[SPEAKER_18]: It's like, what the crap?

441
00:38:18,475 --> 00:38:18,715
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah.

442
00:38:21,036 --> 00:38:23,157
[SPEAKER_21]: There's no way in hell I'm going to win my Oscar pool.

443
00:38:23,438 --> 00:38:26,019
[SPEAKER_21]: I, like, lost, like, the last three or four or five.

444
00:38:27,100 --> 00:38:27,700
[SPEAKER_21]: Ah, damn it.

445
00:38:28,401 --> 00:38:30,582
[SPEAKER_15]: Anyways, sorry to derail that whole train.

446
00:38:31,621 --> 00:38:33,262
[SPEAKER_15]: You poor, poor bastard.

447
00:38:33,382 --> 00:38:34,622
[SPEAKER_15]: Anyway, back to me.

448
00:38:40,484 --> 00:38:40,844
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't know.

449
00:38:40,864 --> 00:38:41,444
[SPEAKER_15]: Let's go to break.

450
00:38:43,085 --> 00:38:44,245
[SPEAKER_11]: Do we get to break things on break?

451
00:38:45,506 --> 00:38:50,507
[SPEAKER_15]: Possibly, because the music that we're going to play might be something that you want to break some stuff to.

452
00:38:50,848 --> 00:38:51,748
[SPEAKER_11]: If it's solitary.

453
00:38:52,739 --> 00:38:54,160
[SPEAKER_15]: No, actually it's going to be athletics.

454
00:38:54,520 --> 00:38:54,960
[SPEAKER_11]: Woohoo!

455
00:38:55,380 --> 00:38:58,962
[SPEAKER_15]: And some folks wanted to hear War Game, so I was going to indulge that request.

456
00:38:59,042 --> 00:39:00,303
[SPEAKER_11]: I vote for Disco Dog.

457
00:39:00,523 --> 00:39:04,505
[SPEAKER_15]: We will get Disco Dog in there as well, and some other athletic favorite songs.

458
00:39:05,105 --> 00:39:08,086
[SPEAKER_15]: And then we're going to come back, and we're going to talk a little bit about Bomani.

459
00:39:09,467 --> 00:39:09,887
[SPEAKER_11]: No!

460
00:39:10,147 --> 00:39:11,548
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, we got news.

461
00:39:11,768 --> 00:39:13,529
[SPEAKER_15]: We got big Guitadora news.

462
00:39:13,869 --> 00:39:14,530
[SPEAKER_15]: Big news!

463
00:39:15,350 --> 00:39:17,731
[SPEAKER_15]: And we also have big Ultramix 2 stuff.

464
00:39:18,572 --> 00:39:19,572
[SPEAKER_11]: Even more woo.

465
00:39:20,272 --> 00:39:21,253
[SPEAKER_11]: That earns a squeeze.

466
00:39:22,498 --> 00:39:26,160
[SPEAKER_15]: Now, are the ignition pads the PlayStation 2 and Xbox kind that have both?

467
00:39:26,180 --> 00:39:28,321
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, they're the dual compatibilities.

468
00:39:28,561 --> 00:39:31,783
[SPEAKER_15]: Because you know what's funny is that when this DDR... I don't think they make the single ones anymore.

469
00:39:32,083 --> 00:39:41,468
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't think they do either, but you know what's funny is that if this Dance Dance Revolution with Mario comes out in the US, which we all expect it will, they'll have to have new ignition pads that have all three.

470
00:39:42,469 --> 00:39:50,233
[SPEAKER_18]: Incidentally, while we're on the subject of Dance Dance Revolution with Mario, which needs to come out because the videos are hilarious, has anybody here played that

471
00:39:52,604 --> 00:40:11,843
[SPEAKER_18]: MC Groove's Dance Beat I have never sold a copy They sent me some, we put a box out, we had them sitting around People look at it, they see the box, they run away screaming

472
00:40:12,401 --> 00:40:13,021
[SPEAKER_18]: Who released it?

473
00:40:13,361 --> 00:40:14,542
[SPEAKER_17]: THQ or something?

474
00:40:15,022 --> 00:40:16,362
[SPEAKER_17]: All I can say is send it back.

475
00:40:17,142 --> 00:40:18,063
[SPEAKER_18]: I can't send it back.

476
00:40:18,563 --> 00:40:21,323
[SPEAKER_18]: The company store, they send me the shit they want in it.

477
00:40:21,343 --> 00:40:25,985
[SPEAKER_15]: Then you need to go put it on their doorstep and ring the doorbell and run.

478
00:40:26,005 --> 00:40:26,825
[SPEAKER_17]: And light it on fire.

479
00:40:28,485 --> 00:40:32,206
[SPEAKER_18]: Then when they step in it like the burning Coleco plastic, they'll be like, no!

480
00:40:33,247 --> 00:40:33,887
[SPEAKER_15]: It's pretty bad.

481
00:40:34,867 --> 00:40:36,028
[SPEAKER_15]: It's really, really bad.

482
00:40:36,048 --> 00:40:38,450
[SPEAKER_15]: It's actually by Mad Catz, the same company.

483
00:40:38,470 --> 00:40:39,411
[SPEAKER_15]: That's right, Mad Catz.

484
00:40:39,431 --> 00:40:41,694
[SPEAKER_15]: The same company that makes those $20 dance pads.

485
00:40:42,374 --> 00:40:43,235
[SPEAKER_15]: The beat pad.

486
00:40:46,419 --> 00:40:50,443
[SPEAKER_15]: Because after you play with them, you want to beat yourself with a stick, honestly.

487
00:40:51,303 --> 00:40:51,783
[SPEAKER_15]: It's bad.

488
00:40:51,863 --> 00:40:53,583
[SPEAKER_15]: It has the full versions of songs.

489
00:40:53,843 --> 00:40:57,504
[SPEAKER_15]: And you'd think that would be a good thing because I was like, parents just don't understand and stuff.

490
00:40:57,564 --> 00:41:00,245
[SPEAKER_15]: But there's really nothing else to it.

491
00:41:00,385 --> 00:41:05,426
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, besides the somewhat interesting music, the steps don't make any sense at all.

492
00:41:06,086 --> 00:41:10,247
[SPEAKER_15]: And the visuals leave a lot to be desired.

493
00:41:10,387 --> 00:41:17,448
[SPEAKER_15]: The entire game without the music is probably about the size where it would fit on a three and a half inch floppy disk.

494
00:41:19,807 --> 00:41:21,488
[SPEAKER_15]: to use in your GameCube floppy drive.

495
00:41:23,750 --> 00:41:25,672
[SPEAKER_15]: Anyway, let's go to break.

496
00:41:25,692 --> 00:41:27,193
[SPEAKER_15]: We're going to start it off with some more game.

497
00:41:27,233 --> 00:41:29,555
[SPEAKER_15]: We'll be back after this with more Orange Lounge Radio.

498
00:41:32,037 --> 00:41:33,359
[SPEAKER_06]: Orange Lounge Radio

499
00:42:12,638 --> 00:42:14,719
[SPEAKER_06]: How many people can think about it?

500
00:42:14,759 --> 00:42:17,120
No matter who you are, however you want to be.

501
00:42:17,140 --> 00:42:20,221
This is the end of a galaxy, no one but an enemy.

502
00:42:20,361 --> 00:42:22,562
Brought to you guys from the gods who are in this.

503
00:42:22,582 --> 00:42:23,943
Everybody who I have to kill.

Thank you for watching!

512
00:48:46,209 --> 00:48:49,752
[SPEAKER_14]: Orange Lounge Radio.

513
00:48:51,933 --> 00:48:54,335
[SPEAKER_15]: We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio.

514
00:48:54,595 --> 00:49:01,079
[SPEAKER_15]: During the break there, Dan was talking to me about a little bit of the celebrity that he gets from being the dude from GameStop.

515
00:49:01,640 --> 00:49:03,221
[SPEAKER_15]: What was some of the stuff you were telling me?

516
00:49:03,281 --> 00:49:05,062
[SPEAKER_15]: You get harassed in restaurants and things?

517
00:49:05,723 --> 00:49:06,163
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, it was

518
00:49:06,806 --> 00:49:12,249
[SPEAKER_18]: We just got an IM, or a message, from someone who thought that they knew who I was.

519
00:49:12,409 --> 00:49:12,629
[SPEAKER_18]: Right.

520
00:49:13,289 --> 00:49:13,890
[SPEAKER_18]: You don't know me.

521
00:49:17,152 --> 00:49:23,015
[SPEAKER_18]: But it's like, you manage a video game store, and you're shocked because you see all these people come through your store.

522
00:49:23,275 --> 00:49:25,056
[SPEAKER_18]: And some of them you get to know because they come in lots.

523
00:49:25,116 --> 00:49:27,197
[SPEAKER_18]: Some of them you start to dread seeing.

524
00:49:27,717 --> 00:49:29,078
[SPEAKER_18]: And you know who I'm talking to if you're listening.

525
00:49:30,368 --> 00:49:32,289
[SPEAKER_18]: You're not listening, I know.

526
00:49:33,589 --> 00:49:38,170
[SPEAKER_18]: And sometimes, it's like you can be, I was a thousand miles from home.

527
00:49:38,490 --> 00:49:39,290
[SPEAKER_18]: I was at E3.

528
00:49:39,950 --> 00:49:42,611
[SPEAKER_18]: Some guy walks up to me and he's like, I know you from somewhere.

529
00:49:43,251 --> 00:49:44,731
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm like, you should know me, I'm famous.

530
00:49:45,491 --> 00:49:46,671
[SPEAKER_18]: Do you know me?

531
00:49:46,891 --> 00:49:47,992
[SPEAKER_15]: I am so famous.

532
00:49:50,452 --> 00:49:55,253
[SPEAKER_18]: But he figured out who I was and he ran into me again and he's like, you're the guy from GameStop.

533
00:49:55,816 --> 00:50:02,193
[SPEAKER_18]: And I'm thinking, wow, this guy's probably been sitting here that whole goddamn show, three days of video games, thinking, why the hell did I know that guy first?

534
00:50:03,668 --> 00:50:10,871
[SPEAKER_15]: You've been in that position, though, haven't you, before, where you swear to God you recognize somebody and you can't think of where you know them from, and it just preys on your mind.

535
00:50:11,071 --> 00:50:13,372
[SPEAKER_18]: It's obvious, and like I said, it's just I thought it was pathetic.

536
00:50:13,792 --> 00:50:17,433
[SPEAKER_18]: It wasn't like I was trying to think of someone who might have been a childhood friend or a grade school buddy.

537
00:50:17,753 --> 00:50:20,894
[SPEAKER_18]: This was the guy who came to me and bought Final Fantasy two weeks ago.

538
00:50:21,114 --> 00:50:23,775
[SPEAKER_17]: Dude, you delivered my pizza once.

539
00:50:24,935 --> 00:50:27,756
[SPEAKER_17]: Damn, you didn't bring me any peppers.

540
00:50:28,156 --> 00:50:29,257
[SPEAKER_18]: You bastard.

541
00:50:32,335 --> 00:50:33,656
[SPEAKER_18]: So yeah, it's freaky freaky.

542
00:50:34,156 --> 00:50:43,223
[SPEAKER_15]: I used to get that sometimes back when I did Rocky Horror Picture Show and I was still around and I was emceeing and I would do the big beginning where we had like the virgin sacrifice, you know.

543
00:50:43,523 --> 00:50:44,704
[SPEAKER_18]: Everyone knows who Rob is anyway.

544
00:50:44,724 --> 00:50:46,666
[SPEAKER_15]: Big dumb fun, well, whatever.

545
00:50:46,866 --> 00:50:48,827
[SPEAKER_18]: I've had people walk up to me and be like, you know Rob, don't you?

546
00:50:49,508 --> 00:50:49,908
[SPEAKER_15]: Shut up.

547
00:50:49,928 --> 00:50:52,330
[SPEAKER_15]: Duh.

548
00:50:52,790 --> 00:50:58,915
[SPEAKER_15]: No, but I would be at the mall or something and these girls would walk by me and go like, you're the guy who took my virginity.

549
00:51:04,986 --> 00:51:07,667
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm like, don't say that with your mother there!

550
00:51:11,869 --> 00:51:12,729
[SPEAKER_17]: Trust me, it wasn't me.

551
00:51:12,829 --> 00:51:13,790
[SPEAKER_17]: Bye!

552
00:51:17,872 --> 00:51:18,552
[SPEAKER_20]: That's no good.

553
00:51:19,092 --> 00:51:19,953
[SPEAKER_15]: I've had that happen.

554
00:51:20,633 --> 00:51:21,753
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm just like, oh my god.

555
00:51:23,634 --> 00:51:25,415
[SPEAKER_15]: Tell your mother you mean you're Rocky.

556
00:51:25,955 --> 00:51:27,496
[SPEAKER_15]: What were you doing after midnight?

557
00:51:27,596 --> 00:51:29,197
[SPEAKER_15]: Mom probably thought that was worse.

558
00:51:29,237 --> 00:51:29,437
[SPEAKER_18]: What?

559
00:51:29,677 --> 00:51:30,437
[SPEAKER_18]: You were at Rocky?

560
00:51:30,457 --> 00:51:31,077
[SPEAKER_15]: You were at Rocky?

561
00:51:31,097 --> 00:51:31,718
[SPEAKER_06]: Why did you do that?

562
00:51:36,553 --> 00:51:47,003
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, years ago, years upon years ago, I used to have a public access show, which actually kind of leads back to the week and day stuff, because we were so bored.

563
00:51:47,043 --> 00:51:48,404
[SPEAKER_15]: What was this, last night or Friday night?

564
00:51:48,464 --> 00:51:49,265
[SPEAKER_15]: It must have been Friday night.

565
00:51:49,305 --> 00:51:59,575
[SPEAKER_15]: We were so bored, and I was in one of those moods where I actually dug up a copy of my old public access show, and I put it on, and I let my friends watch it that were here.

566
00:52:00,014 --> 00:52:00,874
[SPEAKER_19]: That was hilarious.

567
00:52:00,934 --> 00:52:01,875
[SPEAKER_19]: That would have been awesome.

568
00:52:01,955 --> 00:52:02,815
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm sorry I missed that.

569
00:52:03,055 --> 00:52:03,915
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, my God.

570
00:52:04,315 --> 00:52:06,636
[SPEAKER_15]: What was I letting myself be subjected to with that?

571
00:52:06,696 --> 00:52:07,036
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't know.

572
00:52:07,096 --> 00:52:08,497
[SPEAKER_15]: Loki actually caught some of it.

573
00:52:08,877 --> 00:52:09,337
[SPEAKER_15]: Any thoughts?

574
00:52:10,337 --> 00:52:12,198
[SPEAKER_21]: It was strange.

575
00:52:13,818 --> 00:52:25,342
[SPEAKER_15]: So, you know, I used to, because it used to be on public access in this area, so, you know, when I'd be out at the mall, people would kind of be looking at me like, isn't that that gay guy from TV?

576
00:52:25,362 --> 00:52:25,442
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.

577
00:52:26,687 --> 00:52:32,108
[SPEAKER_18]: They're like, I don't want to admit that I watch it, but I want to approach it.

578
00:52:32,208 --> 00:52:33,609
[SPEAKER_18]: That's what you do as they're approaching.

579
00:52:33,629 --> 00:52:34,709
[SPEAKER_18]: They're like, didn't I see you on TV?

580
00:52:34,729 --> 00:52:36,449
[SPEAKER_18]: And you just start pointing at them, just laughing.

581
00:52:37,370 --> 00:52:38,770
[SPEAKER_18]: What, you watch that?

582
00:52:38,850 --> 00:52:39,890
[SPEAKER_18]: You got a problem?

583
00:52:39,910 --> 00:52:41,471
[SPEAKER_18]: You need to go do something.

584
00:52:41,491 --> 00:52:43,451
[SPEAKER_15]: They don't want to admit they watch public access.

585
00:52:43,571 --> 00:52:46,392
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, of course, they don't want to, you know, boomerangs back around.

586
00:52:46,452 --> 00:52:49,253
[SPEAKER_15]: And a show that I was a part of, nonetheless, on public access.

587
00:52:49,613 --> 00:52:51,493
[SPEAKER_18]: See, you're missing, don't implicate yourself.

588
00:52:53,294 --> 00:52:54,214
[SPEAKER_15]: Sorry, my twin.

589
00:52:54,767 --> 00:52:55,468
[SPEAKER_18]: I'd like to think that.

590
00:53:21,980 --> 00:53:22,520
[SPEAKER_15]: Thanks for watching!

591
00:53:38,067 --> 00:53:45,553
[SPEAKER_15]: We had the songpacks be made available in Canada, and I believe it's seven bucks, Canadian, that they want for the songpacks, which are five songs.

592
00:53:45,853 --> 00:53:48,175
[SPEAKER_15]: But this is huge news for those folks that live in Canada.

593
00:53:48,235 --> 00:53:55,700
[SPEAKER_15]: And if you live in Canada and you weren't aware of this, well, you know now, you can actually download all the songpacks, one through, what, eight now.

594
00:53:56,220 --> 00:53:57,982
[SPEAKER_15]: I think you can at least get one through seven.

595
00:53:58,002 --> 00:54:00,183
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm pretty sure you can get eight at this point now.

596
00:54:00,784 --> 00:54:00,924
[SPEAKER_15]: So...

597
00:54:02,361 --> 00:54:06,783
[SPEAKER_15]: Anyway, definitely check that out if you're in Canada and you've been wanting to get those.

598
00:54:07,383 --> 00:54:08,184
[SPEAKER_15]: It's definitely worth it.

599
00:54:09,304 --> 00:54:16,587
[SPEAKER_15]: But for us here in America, we've just been waiting and waiting and waiting for Song Pack 8 to come out.

600
00:54:16,607 --> 00:54:21,669
[SPEAKER_15]: Because it has some new songs that are new to DDR and haven't been in DDR before.

601
00:54:21,730 --> 00:54:26,472
[SPEAKER_15]: Such as Cosmic Cowgirl, that song from DDR Freak... Guitar Freaks.

602
00:54:26,752 --> 00:54:28,352
[SPEAKER_15]: Guitar Freaks, not DDR Freak.

603
00:54:28,372 --> 00:54:29,073
[SPEAKER_15]: That's a different thing.

604
00:54:29,853 --> 00:54:31,814
[SPEAKER_11]: Which is a whole ton of fun to play on Drum Mania.

605
00:54:32,150 --> 00:54:32,630
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes, it is.

606
00:54:32,950 --> 00:54:35,091
[SPEAKER_15]: And you know what's funny about the steps to Cosmic Cowgirl?

607
00:54:35,371 --> 00:54:40,452
[SPEAKER_15]: It's very similar to kind of how you play it on basic on the guitar, so I thought that was kind of funny.

608
00:54:41,172 --> 00:54:41,392
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.

609
00:54:41,892 --> 00:54:44,392
[SPEAKER_15]: And then, let's see, what else is there?

610
00:54:46,873 --> 00:54:49,173
[SPEAKER_15]: By LaLakia, Carried With The Wind was another one.

611
00:54:49,694 --> 00:54:49,954
[SPEAKER_05]: Cool.

612
00:54:50,134 --> 00:54:50,294
[SPEAKER_15]: Yep.

613
00:54:50,534 --> 00:54:56,515
[SPEAKER_15]: And then we have, that's also from Guitar Freaks, and it's kind of a very pop-ish sort of song, like one of those lute songs.

614
00:54:57,225 --> 00:55:02,552
[SPEAKER_15]: and then also Kind Lady Interlude, which is cool, because Kind Lady is cool.

615
00:55:03,093 --> 00:55:07,879
[SPEAKER_15]: And then we have More Deep, which is coming over from Max USA too, or whatever.

616
00:55:08,580 --> 00:55:10,343
[SPEAKER_15]: And then we have another brand new one,

617
00:55:12,085 --> 00:55:19,028
[SPEAKER_15]: And it's a remix of In My Eyes, and it's done by the folks in the band Neuropa, who did the song Standing Still in Time for Ultramix 2.

618
00:55:20,169 --> 00:55:24,771
[SPEAKER_15]: And so what we're going to do, we're going to go ahead and play that for you guys, because we know not all you guys have an Xbox out there.

619
00:55:25,131 --> 00:55:26,612
[SPEAKER_15]: So you probably want to check out this song.

620
00:55:26,652 --> 00:55:27,953
[SPEAKER_15]: Maybe you're thinking about buying the pack.

621
00:55:28,693 --> 00:55:30,494
[SPEAKER_15]: Here it is, a remix of In My Eyes.

622
00:55:30,634 --> 00:55:34,136
[SPEAKER_15]: It's the Neuropa mix, premiere here on Orange Lounge Radio.

623
00:55:34,176 --> 00:55:34,396
[SPEAKER_15]: Enjoy.

624
00:56:17,944 --> 00:56:18,609
and many more.

625
00:57:29,457 --> 00:57:33,360
[SPEAKER_15]: Alright, that was a premiere here of In My Eyes, the Naropa mix.

626
00:57:33,621 --> 00:57:35,642
[SPEAKER_15]: That being said, what did y'all think?

627
00:57:36,063 --> 00:57:38,024
[SPEAKER_15]: DarkSakura, I know you have an opinion.

628
00:57:41,627 --> 00:57:44,870
[SPEAKER_11]: It starts with an A, and it ends with an S, and it spells ass!

629
00:57:46,291 --> 00:57:55,199
[SPEAKER_11]: It's another one of those... I've made this argument before where they try too hard to put too much in it, and do too many things at once.

630
00:57:55,940 --> 00:57:56,080
[SPEAKER_11]: No.

631
00:57:56,100 --> 00:57:56,140
[SPEAKER_11]: No.

632
00:57:56,747 --> 00:58:02,371
[SPEAKER_11]: The only ever good mix that I've heard that was not the original was the Midi Head one.

633
00:58:02,591 --> 00:58:03,171
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, I agree.

634
00:58:03,191 --> 00:58:04,012
[SPEAKER_15]: The Midi Head one is superior.

635
00:58:04,032 --> 00:58:06,474
[SPEAKER_11]: Which was also good because there wasn't any man singing.

636
00:58:07,735 --> 00:58:10,717
[SPEAKER_15]: Loki, what did you think of that one?

637
00:58:12,438 --> 00:58:13,619
[SPEAKER_21]: Eh, it's okay.

638
00:58:13,639 --> 00:58:14,639
[SPEAKER_21]: I don't know.

639
00:58:15,960 --> 00:58:20,343
[SPEAKER_21]: It's just... I don't know.

640
00:58:20,503 --> 00:58:23,045
[SPEAKER_13]: I have the same opinions on the I Feel remixes.

641
00:58:23,125 --> 00:58:23,986
[SPEAKER_13]: They're just like, eh.

642
00:58:25,106 --> 00:58:25,907
[SPEAKER_13]: Kind of lame.

643
00:58:26,897 --> 00:58:30,079
[SPEAKER_15]: Dan, I know you don't really play much DDR, but did you have an opinion on that song at all?

644
00:58:30,880 --> 00:58:34,222
[SPEAKER_20]: It sounded like four other crappy songs sort of jammed together.

645
00:58:34,703 --> 00:58:35,103
[SPEAKER_15]: You know what?

646
00:58:35,143 --> 00:58:38,105
[SPEAKER_15]: That's exactly my opinion on it, is that I think it's too much.

647
00:58:38,505 --> 00:58:39,526
[SPEAKER_15]: There's too many things going on there.

648
00:58:39,546 --> 00:58:47,712
[SPEAKER_18]: It's like I would recognize part of it, well, I guess it wasn't mixed, but I'd recognize part of it from something that I totally didn't expect it to be from, and I'd be thinking, hey, I like that, but I don't like it here.

649
00:58:48,673 --> 00:58:48,993
[SPEAKER_15]: And it's awful.

650
00:58:49,494 --> 00:58:55,503
[SPEAKER_15]: And I feel bad because I really like Naropa and I really, really, really like their other song and Ultramix too.

651
00:58:55,843 --> 00:59:00,870
[SPEAKER_15]: I think it's awesome, but I just don't know where that mix came from, honestly.

652
00:59:00,890 --> 00:59:03,774
[SPEAKER_18]: Hey, we knew in the chatroom we just took a shot at the Sega Master System.

653
00:59:03,834 --> 00:59:04,175
[SPEAKER_18]: Sucks.

654
00:59:06,448 --> 00:59:09,690
[SPEAKER_15]: Back on track, back on track.

655
00:59:09,890 --> 00:59:13,131
[SPEAKER_15]: Hold on, we can hate on people who hate Sega later.

656
00:59:14,772 --> 00:59:19,375
[SPEAKER_15]: But the remix itself is just, it's so busy and there's so much going on.

657
00:59:19,435 --> 00:59:20,195
[SPEAKER_15]: I just, I don't know.

658
00:59:20,335 --> 00:59:22,156
[SPEAKER_15]: The MIDI head one I thought was way better.

659
00:59:22,676 --> 00:59:24,997
[SPEAKER_15]: That one, I hate to say it, I don't really care for it.

660
00:59:25,037 --> 00:59:31,241
[SPEAKER_15]: But the weird thing about it is, is that when you actually play it in the game, the steps I actually like a whole lot.

661
00:59:31,961 --> 00:59:33,722
[SPEAKER_15]: Which is kind of weird because...

662
00:59:35,484 --> 00:59:41,925
[SPEAKER_15]: The steps are kind of odd, and they don't really go with the beat at all, but I think that's the reason why I like it so much, is because it's very different.

663
00:59:42,265 --> 00:59:58,269
[SPEAKER_15]: Like, they're different, and you'd think there's only so many different patterns you could do with four arrows, and everything you can do, everything that can be done has been done, but I think that the steps to the song when I played it, it was the first song I played in a long, long time where I went, huh, these steps are kind of unique.

664
00:59:58,469 --> 00:59:58,889
[SPEAKER_15]: I like it.

665
00:59:59,409 --> 01:00:10,858
[SPEAKER_15]: So, for that reason, it kind of made it a fun one to dance to, but the song itself, it's like, could I take those steps and put them on a different song, and I'd be much happier, because that song doesn't really do it for me.

666
01:00:11,618 --> 01:00:13,280
[SPEAKER_15]: I can't really see getting down to that, so.

667
01:00:14,661 --> 01:00:16,202
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, maybe you guys have a different thought.

668
01:00:16,262 --> 01:00:19,064
[SPEAKER_15]: We will open up the Skype line later if you guys have a thought on that one.

669
01:00:19,104 --> 01:00:21,046
[SPEAKER_15]: You can definitely share your opinion there with us.

670
01:00:21,566 --> 01:00:22,006
[SPEAKER_15]: www.

671
01:00:24,119 --> 01:00:53,043
[SPEAKER_15]: dot orange launch radio dot com click on interact with us and you can learn all sorts of detail about the skype line alright speaking of the skype line we're going to go to the skype line pretty quick and we're going to talk to one of our buddies on the skype line who sent us some news this week on Gita Dora the brand new incarnation of Gita Dora it's going to be a little different so let's see if we can get him on the skype line I just sent him a message that says we're calling so hopefully he's there

672
01:00:54,941 --> 01:00:57,203
[SPEAKER_15]: And hopefully we don't have lag issues or any of that stuff going on.

673
01:00:57,883 --> 01:00:58,683
[SPEAKER_15]: So we'll find out.

674
01:01:01,305 --> 01:01:09,969
[SPEAKER_15]: And we're going to talk about Guitar Freaks and Drum Mania V. Like the song, V. Like peace.

675
01:01:10,810 --> 01:01:11,870
[SPEAKER_15]: And now it doesn't want to call.

676
01:01:11,950 --> 01:01:12,590
[SPEAKER_15]: That's very odd.

677
01:01:13,691 --> 01:01:15,572
[SPEAKER_15]: It's just saying connecting, dot dot dot, connecting.

678
01:01:16,552 --> 01:01:18,113
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh no, and it says user not online.

679
01:01:18,133 --> 01:01:18,574
[SPEAKER_15]: What happened?

680
01:01:18,614 --> 01:01:19,334
[SPEAKER_15]: What happened?

681
01:01:22,708 --> 01:01:23,228
[SPEAKER_15]: All right, fine.

682
01:01:23,248 --> 01:01:24,589
[SPEAKER_15]: What we'll do is we'll go here.

683
01:01:24,669 --> 01:01:29,290
[SPEAKER_15]: We're going to go to the list.

684
01:01:31,611 --> 01:01:40,673
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm actually very excited to be seeing at least some type of new incarnation of Guitar Freaks and Drum Mania because it seems like that series was getting very stale.

685
01:01:40,953 --> 01:01:42,874
[SPEAKER_15]: It was kind of like, oh, here comes 9th mix.

686
01:01:43,134 --> 01:01:44,314
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, here comes 10th mix.

687
01:01:44,634 --> 01:01:45,655
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, here comes 11th mix.

688
01:01:45,735 --> 01:01:46,955
[SPEAKER_15]: It's just the same thing over and over.

689
01:01:47,415 --> 01:01:50,116
[SPEAKER_15]: But now it sounds like that there's actually something new

690
01:01:54,450 --> 01:01:59,538
[SPEAKER_15]: Skyplane isn't open for general calls just yet, but we'll be taking those calls a little bit later.

691
01:01:59,638 --> 01:02:00,880
[SPEAKER_15]: So don't get too impatient.

692
01:02:00,900 --> 01:02:02,302
[SPEAKER_15]: We will get those calls a little later.

693
01:02:03,784 --> 01:02:04,746
[SPEAKER_15]: But first I want to talk about this.

694
01:02:09,099 --> 01:02:17,504
[SPEAKER_15]: So what's going on right now with this is... I guess it's location testing right now, or something weird's going on right now.

695
01:02:17,924 --> 01:02:19,665
[SPEAKER_15]: But we have a little bit of a song list.

696
01:02:19,725 --> 01:02:21,386
[SPEAKER_15]: We have some song lists going on right now.

697
01:02:21,826 --> 01:02:23,567
[SPEAKER_15]: And we're going to post this a little later.

698
01:02:24,228 --> 01:02:25,448
[SPEAKER_15]: A Romanized song list.

699
01:02:25,468 --> 01:02:27,309
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you very much to DarkLionXVI.

700
01:02:27,329 --> 01:02:33,873
[SPEAKER_15]: They gave us a Romanized song list of Guitar Freaks and Drum Mania V. And we're going to post that on our website a little later, the Romanized list.

701
01:02:34,769 --> 01:02:35,449
[SPEAKER_15]: But let's see.

702
01:02:35,589 --> 01:02:38,030
[SPEAKER_15]: Let me point out some highlights through the list here.

703
01:02:38,670 --> 01:02:41,491
[SPEAKER_15]: A brand new Thomas Howard Lichtenstein song, You'll Be a Man.

704
01:02:42,231 --> 01:02:42,851
[SPEAKER_15]: That's what they call it.

705
01:02:43,171 --> 01:02:44,592
[SPEAKER_15]: There's a band called Pooh.

706
01:02:45,892 --> 01:02:47,372
[SPEAKER_15]: And they have a song called Mushroom Boy.

707
01:02:48,073 --> 01:02:48,893
[SPEAKER_11]: Best name ever.

708
01:02:49,073 --> 01:02:52,454
[SPEAKER_15]: Desro featuring Shige with Endless Cruising.

709
01:02:53,174 --> 01:02:55,354
[SPEAKER_15]: And Brad Holmes, After a Hard Day.

710
01:02:56,335 --> 01:02:57,975
[SPEAKER_15]: And then we have some licensed songs.

711
01:02:57,995 --> 01:03:00,436
[SPEAKER_15]: They're actually covers by various folks.

712
01:03:00,996 --> 01:03:01,456
[SPEAKER_15]: But we have...

713
01:03:02,085 --> 01:03:12,091
[SPEAKER_15]: Sakunabo by Otsuka Ai, and then we have Friends by Rebecca, NGS by Asian Kung Fu Generation, Nocturne No.

714
01:03:12,112 --> 01:03:25,120
[SPEAKER_15]: 9 by Hotei Tomoyasu, Wild Challenger by Jindu, and this is the best right here in my opinion, Misery Lou by the Spaghetti Surfers.

715
01:03:25,140 --> 01:03:26,020
[SPEAKER_15]: You remember Misery Lou?

716
01:03:26,080 --> 01:03:27,782
[SPEAKER_15]: Misery Lou is the song from Pulp Fiction.

717
01:03:28,182 --> 01:03:31,204
[SPEAKER_15]: Duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh.

718
01:03:32,386 --> 01:03:33,127
[SPEAKER_15]: That song was awesome.

719
01:03:35,249 --> 01:03:41,415
[SPEAKER_15]: And then there's going to be some licensed songs as performed by the original musician that go on in this as well.

720
01:03:43,397 --> 01:03:46,480
[SPEAKER_15]: And let's see, we're going to try getting our buddy back on the line here again.

721
01:03:50,805 --> 01:03:52,366
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm going to tell him to call us, hopefully.

722
01:03:52,867 --> 01:03:53,868
[SPEAKER_15]: Something weird's going on there.

723
01:03:59,814 --> 01:04:03,397
[SPEAKER_15]: And we have some licensed songs that's being performed by the original artists.

724
01:04:03,758 --> 01:04:08,582
[SPEAKER_15]: And what I thought was interesting about this is that there's a Vanilla Ninja song in there.

725
01:04:08,962 --> 01:04:12,646
[SPEAKER_15]: And you know Vanilla Ninja was a girl group that did Tough Enough in Ultra Mix 2?

726
01:04:13,126 --> 01:04:19,852
[SPEAKER_15]: Vanilla Ninja is on the list, and they are doing the song Liar, which I think is very interesting.

727
01:04:19,952 --> 01:04:20,673
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, there's our buddy.

728
01:04:22,334 --> 01:04:22,735
[SPEAKER_15]: Hi!

729
01:04:23,308 --> 01:04:23,668
[SPEAKER_15]: Siggy?

730
01:04:23,989 --> 01:04:25,169
[SPEAKER_15]: Hey guys, Siggy here.

731
01:04:25,230 --> 01:04:26,851
[SPEAKER_15]: Finally, we got you on the line.

732
01:04:27,431 --> 01:04:28,952
[SPEAKER_24]: I don't know what the heck happened.

733
01:04:29,032 --> 01:04:30,374
[SPEAKER_15]: Skype's acting funny tonight.

734
01:04:30,414 --> 01:04:31,314
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't know what's going on.

735
01:04:31,614 --> 01:04:38,600
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, so we've been talking a little bit about Guitar Freaks, Drug Mania, V. We were talking about the original songs, the licensed cover songs.

736
01:04:38,640 --> 01:04:46,266
[SPEAKER_15]: I was just getting into the licensed songs performed by the original artists, and I was kind of going, Vanilla Ninja, WTF!

737
01:04:46,706 --> 01:04:49,989
[SPEAKER_15]: They're the girly band from Ultramix 2.

738
01:04:50,329 --> 01:04:51,450
[SPEAKER_15]: What the hell are they doing here?

739
01:04:52,611 --> 01:04:53,171
[SPEAKER_15]: Any thoughts?

740
01:04:54,172 --> 01:04:54,572
[SPEAKER_24]: I don't know.

741
01:04:54,652 --> 01:04:56,132
[SPEAKER_24]: I've never heard of Vanilla Ninja.

742
01:04:56,212 --> 01:04:59,813
[SPEAKER_15]: Vanilla Ninja is the group that did Tough Enough in Ultramix 2.

743
01:04:59,913 --> 01:05:01,094
[SPEAKER_15]: And it's also in the groove.

744
01:05:01,174 --> 01:05:03,395
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm not into DDR Ultramix and stuff.

745
01:05:03,475 --> 01:05:05,635
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, do you do the in the groove thing at all?

746
01:05:06,376 --> 01:05:07,516
[SPEAKER_24]: Oh, I never, never.

747
01:05:07,696 --> 01:05:08,736
[SPEAKER_24]: I never go for in the groove.

748
01:05:08,977 --> 01:05:09,257
[SPEAKER_15]: All right.

749
01:05:09,297 --> 01:05:09,937
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, that's fine.

750
01:05:09,957 --> 01:05:10,477
[SPEAKER_24]: Not my thing.

751
01:05:12,018 --> 01:05:14,738
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, I'd play a little clip, but I just don't feel like it right now.

752
01:05:15,139 --> 01:05:22,061
[SPEAKER_15]: Tell me about some of the other stuff we can expect with Guitar Freaks and Drum Mania V. Stuff that you've heard about.

753
01:05:22,081 --> 01:05:22,221
[SPEAKER_24]: Well, uh...

754
01:05:23,348 --> 01:05:35,934
[SPEAKER_24]: Not really much to expect, but on the official website of Gita Dora V right now, the Gita Dora team is apologizing because they did not include the hidden option.

755
01:05:37,514 --> 01:05:38,015
[SPEAKER_15]: Weird.

756
01:05:38,355 --> 01:05:39,155
[SPEAKER_24]: The hidden option.

757
01:05:40,116 --> 01:05:44,798
[SPEAKER_15]: Isn't this game location testing right now, or did it actually... They're actually playing right now.

758
01:05:45,078 --> 01:05:45,498
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, wow.

759
01:05:46,438 --> 01:05:46,819
[SPEAKER_15]: Interesting.

760
01:05:47,379 --> 01:05:49,900
[SPEAKER_24]: Yeah, the official website of Gita Dora V is open.

761
01:05:51,027 --> 01:05:54,488
[SPEAKER_15]: But sometimes those websites just go up when they're location testing.

762
01:05:54,528 --> 01:05:56,029
[SPEAKER_15]: Is this game actually out and about now?

763
01:05:56,969 --> 01:06:01,131
[SPEAKER_24]: There wasn't anything said about the location test, so that means they're already playing.

764
01:06:01,471 --> 01:06:01,972
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, wow.

765
01:06:02,452 --> 01:06:02,712
[SPEAKER_24]: Yeah.

766
01:06:02,952 --> 01:06:03,472
[SPEAKER_15]: I'll be damned.

767
01:06:05,753 --> 01:06:06,033
[SPEAKER_15]: All right.

768
01:06:06,393 --> 01:06:12,436
[SPEAKER_15]: So you wanted to introduce a little song here, something that we can actually expect to hear in Guitar Freaks Drum Media V, yes?

769
01:06:13,016 --> 01:06:16,197
[SPEAKER_24]: It is the exact licensed song performed by the original artist.

770
01:06:17,098 --> 01:06:17,658
[SPEAKER_15]: Very cool.

771
01:06:18,198 --> 01:06:20,219
[SPEAKER_24]: So Bimani Metalheads, Rejoice.

772
01:06:20,922 --> 01:06:21,423
[SPEAKER_15]: We won't be sad

773
01:06:50,116 --> 01:06:55,561
We had none, we had none, we had none, we had none We had none, we had none, we had none

774
01:07:23,924 --> 01:07:30,851
[SPEAKER_06]: We've come to an understanding You are a prophet While I'm new to the race of secrets No more excuses

775
01:07:56,781 --> 01:08:02,145
[SPEAKER_06]: And all the time we try to tear the street down

776
01:09:02,995 --> 01:09:08,218
[SPEAKER_15]: Certainly a diverse reaction to that song in the chat room.

777
01:09:08,418 --> 01:09:11,600
[SPEAKER_15]: And hold on a minute because my head's still ringing a little bit there.

778
01:09:12,321 --> 01:09:12,561
[SPEAKER_15]: Wow.

779
01:09:13,939 --> 01:09:14,560
[SPEAKER_11]: Metalhead Haters

780
01:09:36,443 --> 01:09:49,893
[SPEAKER_15]: You know what, okay, I guess the metalhead folks, because some folks in the chatroom are just cheering at this, and some people are just absolutely saying, I don't even want to play Guitar Freaks Drum Mania V right now if this song's on it.

781
01:09:51,615 --> 01:09:59,781
[SPEAKER_15]: But some folks are just saying this is awesome, so certainly a diverse selection of music to be in the next Guitar Freaks Drum Mania incarnation.

782
01:10:00,602 --> 01:10:01,983
[SPEAKER_15]: I'd totally play that song.

783
01:10:02,083 --> 01:10:03,003
[SPEAKER_15]: That's just great.

784
01:10:03,444 --> 01:10:05,065
[SPEAKER_15]: Except my hand would hurt like a bitch.

785
01:10:05,444 --> 01:10:06,545
[SPEAKER_15]: But I'd play that song.

786
01:10:06,945 --> 01:10:07,826
[SPEAKER_15]: I would play that song.

787
01:10:08,146 --> 01:10:12,009
[SPEAKER_18]: You get the wailing bonus for, like, whacking the guitar against the machine when you're done?

788
01:10:12,109 --> 01:10:17,914
[SPEAKER_15]: That's the kind of song where I would wail and then swing the guitar around and smack a Roseville, Golfland child in the face.

789
01:10:19,515 --> 01:10:20,416
[SPEAKER_15]: In front of his mother.

790
01:10:20,436 --> 01:10:26,881
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't have any tokens for you, you little shit!

791
01:10:26,961 --> 01:10:31,185
[SPEAKER_21]: Can you imagine the drum mania part of that song?

792
01:10:32,865 --> 01:10:35,366
[SPEAKER_15]: That's not going to be an easy song, whatever that is.

793
01:10:35,406 --> 01:10:38,907
[SPEAKER_15]: That's very interesting.

794
01:10:42,428 --> 01:10:46,769
[SPEAKER_15]: Some folks in the chat room are saying, here are the lyrics to that song, and then just banging on the keyboard.

795
01:10:47,049 --> 01:10:48,429
[SPEAKER_15]: Because you really can't understand.

796
01:10:48,789 --> 01:10:50,150
[SPEAKER_15]: Let me take a little clip.

797
01:10:50,730 --> 01:10:53,110
[SPEAKER_15]: Siggy, help me understand here, because you seem to be in the middle.

798
01:10:53,371 --> 01:10:54,951
[SPEAKER_15]: Help me understand what they're saying in this song.

799
01:10:56,912 --> 01:10:58,192
[SPEAKER_15]: Let me get you to the part where they're actually singing.

800
01:11:05,195 --> 01:11:11,317
[SPEAKER_15]: Sounds like Lords of Dishwasher Scabies is what I heard.

801
01:11:12,518 --> 01:11:18,380
[SPEAKER_24]: Honestly, I haven't checked out the lyrics to Panasonic Youth yet.

802
01:11:18,540 --> 01:11:20,180
[SPEAKER_24]: This is a thrash metal.

803
01:11:23,001 --> 01:11:24,962
[SPEAKER_24]: So, yeah, it's kind of really hard to understand.

804
01:11:25,103 --> 01:11:26,864
[SPEAKER_15]: It certainly does make me want to break things.

805
01:11:29,066 --> 01:11:29,426
[SPEAKER_13]: Seriously.

806
01:11:31,808 --> 01:11:37,172
[SPEAKER_15]: All right, well, it's certainly a sign of diversity to come in the next Guitar Freaks.

807
01:11:37,512 --> 01:11:39,713
[SPEAKER_15]: Any other news on this new mix you want to share with us?

808
01:11:39,754 --> 01:11:43,456
[SPEAKER_24]: Well, let me just help you out pronouncing the songs right.

809
01:11:43,636 --> 01:11:45,818
[SPEAKER_15]: Please do, because I have issues, apparently.

810
01:11:48,180 --> 01:11:50,862
[SPEAKER_24]: The Carried by the Wind song, it's actually pronounced Balalaika.

811
01:11:50,922 --> 01:11:52,283
[SPEAKER_15]: Ah, okay.

812
01:11:53,621 --> 01:11:55,502
[SPEAKER_15]: Ancient Breeze by Ono Hideyuki and White Tornado by Trek Trap

813
01:12:11,710 --> 01:12:12,491
[SPEAKER_24]: Yeah, you get to pick.

814
01:12:12,611 --> 01:12:15,233
[SPEAKER_15]: Because usually, like in the older Guitar Freaks, you don't get to pick.

815
01:12:15,273 --> 01:12:19,857
[SPEAKER_15]: But I noticed, I think in the newer one, like some of the newer ones, you get to start picking a little later on.

816
01:12:20,217 --> 01:12:21,699
[SPEAKER_11]: I just remember, what was it?

817
01:12:22,019 --> 01:12:29,685
[SPEAKER_11]: Fifth note was fourth mix with Carnival Day.

818
01:12:31,267 --> 01:12:33,188
[SPEAKER_11]: And going, what the hell song is this?

819
01:12:33,208 --> 01:12:35,110
[SPEAKER_11]: Because it kicked my ass the first time around.

820
01:12:35,470 --> 01:12:36,671
[SPEAKER_15]: I remember Fireball.

821
01:12:37,211 --> 01:12:37,951
[SPEAKER_11]: Fireball.

822
01:12:37,991 --> 01:12:39,071
[SPEAKER_15]: From like 6 and 5.

823
01:12:39,912 --> 01:12:41,732
[SPEAKER_11]: But now I can beat Carnival Day easy.

824
01:12:42,913 --> 01:12:44,674
[SPEAKER_11]: All the songs now are a lot harder than they used to be.

825
01:12:46,354 --> 01:12:55,498
[SPEAKER_24]: Yeah, on the Gita Dora V, there are two special stages, which is Encore, Fairy Tales by Izumi Mitsushiko, and the Premium Encore stage.

826
01:12:55,538 --> 01:12:56,558
[SPEAKER_24]: Here's a little bit interesting.

827
01:12:56,838 --> 01:12:58,979
[SPEAKER_24]: The Zabu Fluta by Wanyan Panic.

828
01:12:59,199 --> 01:13:02,341
[SPEAKER_24]: Now, the song The Zabu Fluta is a Mozart song.

829
01:13:03,121 --> 01:13:03,361
[SPEAKER_15]: Hmm.

830
01:13:05,134 --> 01:13:10,159
[SPEAKER_15]: But I'm sure they've made it very difficult to play and rock out because it's a premium encore.

831
01:13:10,319 --> 01:13:13,622
[SPEAKER_15]: Any idea what the differences are between an encore and a premium encore at this point?

832
01:13:14,143 --> 01:13:17,386
[SPEAKER_24]: Well, it's kind of like Guitadora 10-9.

833
01:13:19,869 --> 01:13:28,217
[SPEAKER_24]: Like, you know, if you have a double ass on an extra stage, you get to access premium encore stage, which was a timepiece phase 2.

834
01:13:28,918 --> 01:13:29,198
[SPEAKER_15]: Right.

835
01:13:30,327 --> 01:13:30,647
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay.

836
01:13:31,228 --> 01:13:41,698
[SPEAKER_24]: If you don't get, you know, if you don't get an, if you got an S, you get to access Unscore Stage, which is, you know, which is a Model DD5 on a Guita Dora 9.

837
01:13:41,798 --> 01:13:42,619
[SPEAKER_24]: It's kind of like that.

838
01:13:43,119 --> 01:13:44,300
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, okay, that makes sense.

839
01:13:44,580 --> 01:13:45,041
[SPEAKER_15]: Sounds cool.

840
01:13:45,121 --> 01:13:46,082
[SPEAKER_15]: Loki, you had a comment?

841
01:13:46,102 --> 01:13:47,924
[SPEAKER_15]: You wanted to say something?

842
01:13:47,944 --> 01:13:48,164
[SPEAKER_15]: No.

843
01:13:48,644 --> 01:13:49,125
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, I thought you did.

844
01:13:49,165 --> 01:13:50,546
[SPEAKER_15]: You were like reaching for the mic, I thought.

845
01:13:50,566 --> 01:13:51,167
[SPEAKER_15]: Fine.

846
01:13:51,207 --> 01:13:51,447
[SPEAKER_15]: Fine.

847
01:13:52,840 --> 01:13:58,645
[SPEAKER_15]: Any other comments you want to tell us about Guitadora V until we start seeing some machines here in the States and we start getting some news around here?

848
01:13:58,705 --> 01:13:59,866
[SPEAKER_24]: There are revival songs.

849
01:13:59,946 --> 01:14:04,790
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm not sure whether it's going to be an e-amusement access or not.

850
01:14:05,030 --> 01:14:08,153
[SPEAKER_24]: But here are the songs that are going to be revived.

851
01:14:08,193 --> 01:14:13,958
[SPEAKER_24]: Model DD2, Herring Row, Staff, Smile For You, High...

852
01:14:14,764 --> 01:14:19,986
[SPEAKER_24]: Sweet Illusion, Potpourri d'Orange, Heaven Inside, and Depend on Me Long Version.

853
01:14:20,126 --> 01:14:23,087
[SPEAKER_15]: Come on, everybody knows that song is Potpourri d'Orange.

854
01:14:23,187 --> 01:14:23,567
[SPEAKER_15]: Come on.

855
01:14:24,208 --> 01:14:25,268
[SPEAKER_24]: Potpourri d'Orange.

856
01:14:26,668 --> 01:14:27,529
[SPEAKER_15]: It's Paul Sanderson.

857
01:14:30,050 --> 01:14:31,250
[SPEAKER_15]: But I hate the French.

858
01:14:31,810 --> 01:14:32,631
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm kidding, I'm kidding.

859
01:14:32,851 --> 01:14:33,531
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, merde.

860
01:14:35,292 --> 01:14:37,392
[SPEAKER_15]: Everybody knows that song is Potpourri d'Orange.

861
01:14:37,432 --> 01:14:38,933
[SPEAKER_15]: Don't give me that d'orange stuff.

862
01:14:39,580 --> 01:14:40,340
[SPEAKER_15]: It's Da Orange.

863
01:14:40,880 --> 01:14:43,021
[SPEAKER_15]: It's much better when it's pronounced in French, Monsieur.

864
01:14:43,041 --> 01:14:45,502
[SPEAKER_15]: Just like you're listening to Da Orange Lounge Radio, alright?

865
01:14:45,542 --> 01:14:46,202
[SPEAKER_15]: It's Da Orange.

866
01:14:46,342 --> 01:14:48,683
[SPEAKER_15]: It's not Da Orange Lounge Radio.

867
01:14:48,763 --> 01:14:55,785
[SPEAKER_24]: And yeah, and the other Orange Lounge song is pronounced Putori de Marmalade.

868
01:14:56,845 --> 01:14:59,826
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, well now I've heard Marmalade, but that's only because I know this song.

869
01:15:00,206 --> 01:15:02,587
[SPEAKER_15]: Criole de Marmalade.

870
01:15:07,618 --> 01:15:12,201
[SPEAKER_15]: Alright, Siggy, thanks for the updates on Guitadora V. We appreciate it.

871
01:15:12,281 --> 01:15:14,603
[SPEAKER_15]: Even if that song gave us all a headache, we do appreciate it.

872
01:15:15,524 --> 01:15:16,364
[SPEAKER_15]: Alright, have a good one, buddy.

873
01:15:16,384 --> 01:15:17,325
[SPEAKER_24]: Alright, later.

874
01:15:17,465 --> 01:15:17,745
[SPEAKER_15]: Later.

875
01:15:19,667 --> 01:15:20,727
[SPEAKER_15]: Always helping us out there.

876
01:15:21,128 --> 01:15:24,650
[SPEAKER_15]: Helping me out with my pronunciation because I have issues pronouncing things.

877
01:15:24,790 --> 01:15:25,671
[SPEAKER_11]: Because I've given up.

878
01:15:29,628 --> 01:15:30,048
[SPEAKER_15]: You know what?

879
01:15:30,308 --> 01:15:37,991
[SPEAKER_15]: At some point, we're going to roll you over here to this screen so you can see this list and you're going to start reading all this stuff so they can make fun of me.

880
01:15:38,451 --> 01:15:38,691
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay.

881
01:15:38,911 --> 01:15:40,611
[SPEAKER_15]: Or they can make fun of you instead of me.

882
01:15:41,171 --> 01:15:41,431
[SPEAKER_15]: Loki.

883
01:15:42,112 --> 01:15:42,832
[SPEAKER_21]: I found the lyrics.

884
01:15:43,332 --> 01:15:44,532
[SPEAKER_15]: You found the lyrics.

885
01:15:45,933 --> 01:15:48,713
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, these are the lyrics to that song, Panasonic.

886
01:15:48,733 --> 01:15:51,294
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm going to give you a little taste of the lyrics.

887
01:15:52,715 --> 01:15:53,855
[SPEAKER_15]: Should I do it in their style?

888
01:15:55,792 --> 01:15:57,393
[SPEAKER_18]: The idea is we want to know what they are.

889
01:15:57,853 --> 01:15:58,313
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, sorry.

890
01:15:58,734 --> 01:16:05,897
[SPEAKER_15]: We wrote these plans, took the order, the architecture, and followed them to the end until the gears ground cold and relentless.

891
01:16:06,377 --> 01:16:07,458
[SPEAKER_15]: There was no remorse.

892
01:16:07,578 --> 01:16:08,238
[SPEAKER_15]: We had none.

893
01:16:08,298 --> 01:16:10,319
[SPEAKER_15]: We kept on with no trace of a regret.

894
01:16:10,860 --> 01:16:13,381
[SPEAKER_15]: I never saw any blood, no soul for the body.

895
01:16:13,461 --> 01:16:15,722
[SPEAKER_15]: Watched them turn, her scab-covered skin.

896
01:16:15,942 --> 01:16:19,164
[SPEAKER_15]: Hey, that's the part that I thought was dishwasher scabies, because of the skin.

897
01:16:19,904 --> 01:16:34,111
[SPEAKER_15]: Her scab-covered skin into a stone like a coal in the sky Searching for the dawn for the last time Bloated with wide eyes wide We've come to an understanding You lose, I profit, high noon And there ain't no secrets no more The song is called what?

898
01:16:34,131 --> 01:16:35,712
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, I'm not going to read the whole damn song.

899
01:16:36,092 --> 01:16:37,192
[SPEAKER_15]: And it's one giant run-on.

900
01:16:38,533 --> 01:16:42,155
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, the whole thing is one giant run-on sentence, which is not much of a surprise.

901
01:16:42,635 --> 01:16:43,716
[SPEAKER_18]: What's the song called again?

902
01:16:44,256 --> 01:16:45,817
[SPEAKER_15]: It's called Panasonic Youth.

903
01:16:46,197 --> 01:16:48,438
[SPEAKER_18]: I thought it was going to be about, like, VCRs and...

904
01:16:54,158 --> 01:16:59,540
[SPEAKER_15]: When I first read it, I only heard, I don't know, somehow my eyes only caught the Sonic Youth part.

905
01:16:59,900 --> 01:17:03,001
[SPEAKER_15]: And I was like, cool, we're getting a Sonic Youth song in Guitar Freaks.

906
01:17:04,282 --> 01:17:05,622
[SPEAKER_15]: And then I was disappointed.

907
01:17:06,983 --> 01:17:08,043
[SPEAKER_18]: Especially once you heard it.

908
01:17:09,136 --> 01:17:12,119
[SPEAKER_11]: There is a Sonic Youth song that I would want in Guitar Freaks.

909
01:17:13,080 --> 01:17:13,461
[SPEAKER_11]: And that's 100%.

910
01:17:13,921 --> 01:17:16,384
[SPEAKER_18]: I want way more songs in Guitar Freaks.

911
01:17:16,464 --> 01:17:17,405
[SPEAKER_18]: And more home versions.

912
01:17:17,985 --> 01:17:20,408
[SPEAKER_15]: We definitely need more home versions.

913
01:17:20,668 --> 01:17:21,128
[SPEAKER_15]: Amen.

914
01:17:21,269 --> 01:17:23,491
[SPEAKER_18]: I need to put my Drum Mania controller to use.

915
01:17:24,172 --> 01:17:26,634
[SPEAKER_18]: Dude, I've been session moding it all the time.

916
01:17:26,654 --> 01:17:27,775
[SPEAKER_18]: You just won't come down and play.

917
01:17:28,176 --> 01:17:28,416
[SPEAKER_15]: All right.

918
01:17:29,826 --> 01:17:33,247
[SPEAKER_15]: If you can hear the breathing in the background, that's because we did pick up the Skype line.

919
01:17:33,547 --> 01:17:36,508
[SPEAKER_15]: Even though I didn't say it was open, eh, hell, people were calling in anyway.

920
01:17:36,848 --> 01:17:38,088
[SPEAKER_15]: Ah, hell, let's take a call.

921
01:17:39,028 --> 01:17:40,128
[SPEAKER_15]: You're on Orange Lounge Radio.

922
01:17:40,148 --> 01:17:40,508
[SPEAKER_15]: Who dis?

923
01:17:41,408 --> 01:17:42,529
[SPEAKER_15]: This is El Mullet.

924
01:17:42,909 --> 01:17:43,829
[SPEAKER_15]: Hello, El Mullet.

925
01:17:43,849 --> 01:17:44,409
[SPEAKER_15]: How you doing?

926
01:17:44,949 --> 01:17:45,969
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm doing good, Skye.

927
01:17:46,009 --> 01:17:46,789
[SPEAKER_23]: How about yourself?

928
01:17:47,370 --> 01:17:48,050
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm okay.

929
01:17:48,090 --> 01:17:52,511
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm trying to get over the Dishwater Scabies song, but otherwise I'm doing okay.

930
01:17:53,831 --> 01:17:54,431
[SPEAKER_15]: What's on your mind?

931
01:17:55,495 --> 01:17:58,856
[SPEAKER_23]: Well, I have recently taken the plunge into 2DX.

932
01:17:59,476 --> 01:18:00,916
[SPEAKER_15]: Congratulations!

933
01:18:01,616 --> 01:18:04,497
[SPEAKER_15]: How does one take the plunge, so to speak, into 2DX?

934
01:18:05,277 --> 01:18:08,638
[SPEAKER_23]: Well, you spend $250 on games in the controller.

935
01:18:08,698 --> 01:18:09,618
[SPEAKER_23]: That's quite a plunge.

936
01:18:10,938 --> 01:18:11,338
[SPEAKER_23]: Been there.

937
01:18:11,498 --> 01:18:12,699
[SPEAKER_15]: Been there, done that, yes.

938
01:18:13,079 --> 01:18:15,639
[SPEAKER_15]: And so how are you enjoying the water now that you've taken the plunge?

939
01:18:16,780 --> 01:18:18,420
[SPEAKER_23]: I am enjoying the water very much.

940
01:18:19,178 --> 01:18:19,719
[SPEAKER_23]: Thanks for watching!

941
01:18:26,916 --> 01:18:28,617
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, how is it going for you?

942
01:18:28,677 --> 01:18:31,879
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, how are you warming up into the game?

943
01:18:31,919 --> 01:18:36,843
[SPEAKER_15]: Did you jump right into hard stuff, or did you just start on beginner mode or drill mode?

944
01:18:36,883 --> 01:18:38,084
[SPEAKER_15]: How are you getting into this game?

945
01:18:38,104 --> 01:18:47,892
[SPEAKER_23]: Well, I wanted to start on Light 7, but I was forced into beginner mode because, well, two stars on Light 7 kicked my ass, and that couldn't have been right.

946
01:18:49,713 --> 01:18:50,234
[SPEAKER_23]: It's tough.

947
01:18:50,294 --> 01:18:50,914
[SPEAKER_23]: It's a tough game.

948
01:18:51,174 --> 01:18:53,216
[SPEAKER_23]: Have you ever played the arcade version at all?

949
01:18:54,125 --> 01:18:56,907
[SPEAKER_23]: Actually, I have a total of two times.

950
01:18:57,668 --> 01:19:03,532
[SPEAKER_23]: Once in 2003 when I went to Vegas, and once in 2004 when the machine in Vegas moved to a different place.

951
01:19:04,092 --> 01:19:06,934
[SPEAKER_23]: So you at least had some idea of what to expect?

952
01:19:07,935 --> 01:19:08,455
[SPEAKER_23]: Pretty much.

953
01:19:08,555 --> 01:19:15,981
[SPEAKER_23]: I mean, I had more experience in the original Beatmania, actually.

954
01:19:16,381 --> 01:19:17,562
[SPEAKER_23]: I played it a few more times.

955
01:19:18,894 --> 01:19:20,095
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, right on.

956
01:19:22,076 --> 01:19:29,139
[SPEAKER_15]: Now, usually there's that big question that always goes around out there is that, you know, I'm new to 2DX, what style should I buy?

957
01:19:29,739 --> 01:19:31,060
[SPEAKER_23]: So what styles did you end up buying?

958
01:19:31,640 --> 01:19:35,302
[SPEAKER_23]: I ended up getting 7th and 8th style being as they are the most current ones.

959
01:19:37,784 --> 01:19:44,367
[SPEAKER_23]: So far I like 7th style the best because it has the more fleshed out beginner's mode and it has more of the songs that I like.

960
01:19:45,842 --> 01:19:49,066
[SPEAKER_15]: Interesting, because I kind of preferred 8th style when I played them both.

961
01:19:49,086 --> 01:19:50,968
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, it's kind of interesting, but okay, alright.

962
01:19:51,208 --> 01:19:53,150
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, of course, but we have a different perspective.

963
01:19:53,170 --> 01:19:54,552
[SPEAKER_15]: You know, we're not new anymore.

964
01:19:54,572 --> 01:19:57,755
[SPEAKER_11]: I spent three hours playing 8th style one night.

965
01:19:58,215 --> 01:19:58,736
[SPEAKER_15]: That's pretty hot.

966
01:19:58,756 --> 01:19:59,437
[SPEAKER_11]: On New Year's Eve.

967
01:19:59,657 --> 01:20:00,798
[SPEAKER_18]: Which one has burning heat?

968
01:20:02,060 --> 01:20:02,140
[SPEAKER_15]: 7th.

969
01:20:03,601 --> 01:20:03,922
[SPEAKER_15]: 7th, yes.

970
01:20:04,422 --> 01:20:05,644
[SPEAKER_18]: Then 7th style rocks.

971
01:20:07,921 --> 01:20:13,582
[SPEAKER_23]: It's not that I don't like 8th style, it's that 7th style is much better for me to get into.

972
01:20:13,602 --> 01:20:15,362
[SPEAKER_23]: I can play more songs on beginner.

973
01:20:16,883 --> 01:20:20,163
[SPEAKER_23]: It's much easier for me to go through.

974
01:20:20,203 --> 01:20:25,564
[SPEAKER_23]: Then I go to 8th style, play a few songs, and go back to 7th style and cower in the corner of beginner's mode again.

975
01:20:27,344 --> 01:20:27,944
[SPEAKER_15]: There you go.

976
01:20:28,444 --> 01:20:32,605
[SPEAKER_15]: So, is your goal to become a 2DX master?

977
01:20:32,625 --> 01:20:37,326
[SPEAKER_15]: Are you going to pick up the other styles at some point, or do you think this is going to be it for you, or what

978
01:20:39,243 --> 01:20:48,111
[SPEAKER_23]: I'm looking into purchasing Ninth Style eventually when it comes out, but I'm leaning toward waiting for it rather than pre-ordering for it.

979
01:20:48,311 --> 01:20:54,397
[SPEAKER_23]: I'd rather get good on the two games that I have before jumping into a third one and spreading myself even further.

980
01:20:55,390 --> 01:20:55,931
[SPEAKER_15]: NightStyleSongList

981
01:21:15,532 --> 01:21:17,814
[SPEAKER_15]: And that's the one thing that's holding me back from playing a lot of 2DX.

982
01:21:17,835 --> 01:21:24,982
[SPEAKER_11]: That's what I don't get is why my controller, which is a good two years older than yours, is still in perfect condition.

983
01:21:25,102 --> 01:21:28,225
[SPEAKER_15]: Mine took a lot of abuse, especially when... Mine fell off of the van.

984
01:21:29,467 --> 01:21:30,107
[SPEAKER_15]: Then I don't know.

985
01:21:30,408 --> 01:21:32,009
[SPEAKER_15]: I really don't know what to tell you on that one.

986
01:21:32,049 --> 01:21:34,652
[SPEAKER_18]: I'd like to tell that story, but we don't have that kind of time.

987
01:21:35,273 --> 01:21:36,794
[SPEAKER_18]: Actually, we do have quite a bit of time.

988
01:21:37,739 --> 01:21:40,340
[SPEAKER_18]: Told her, don't take the fucking controller.

989
01:21:40,461 --> 01:21:41,561
[SPEAKER_18]: You're not going to use it.

990
01:21:41,601 --> 01:21:42,782
[SPEAKER_18]: We're going to a convention.

991
01:21:42,802 --> 01:21:43,962
[SPEAKER_18]: We're going to have other things to do.

992
01:21:43,982 --> 01:21:44,483
[SPEAKER_05]: I used it.

993
01:21:44,563 --> 01:21:45,343
[SPEAKER_18]: She's like, no, no, no, no, no.

994
01:21:45,363 --> 01:21:45,883
[SPEAKER_18]: I got to take it.

995
01:21:45,923 --> 01:21:46,604
[SPEAKER_18]: It's brand new.

996
01:21:46,744 --> 01:21:47,965
[SPEAKER_18]: I mean, we just got it.

997
01:21:48,045 --> 01:21:48,725
[SPEAKER_18]: Beautiful shape.

998
01:21:49,125 --> 01:21:50,666
[SPEAKER_18]: I said, no, it's going to get abused.

999
01:21:50,706 --> 01:21:52,027
[SPEAKER_18]: You're going to throw it in the back of the van.

1000
01:21:52,047 --> 01:21:52,887
[SPEAKER_18]: Something's going to happen.

1001
01:21:53,327 --> 01:21:53,968
[SPEAKER_18]: We get there.

1002
01:21:54,068 --> 01:21:55,028
[SPEAKER_18]: We pull in the parking garage.

1003
01:21:55,088 --> 01:21:56,609
[SPEAKER_18]: We pop open the back of the van.

1004
01:21:56,909 --> 01:21:59,371
[SPEAKER_18]: The controller doesn't just fall out.

1005
01:21:59,671 --> 01:22:01,832
[SPEAKER_18]: It like gets propelled out.

1006
01:22:02,312 --> 01:22:05,634
[SPEAKER_18]: Flies across the parking garage and just clatters in the pavement.

1007
01:22:06,704 --> 01:22:11,026
[SPEAKER_18]: Jamie's got a look on her face like... And I'm like, see?

1008
01:22:11,046 --> 01:22:13,527
[SPEAKER_18]: I fucking told you that was going to happen.

1009
01:22:13,607 --> 01:22:15,788
[SPEAKER_15]: And that's probably the sound she made, too, huh?

1010
01:22:15,848 --> 01:22:16,288
[SPEAKER_18]: Exactly.

1011
01:22:16,308 --> 01:22:17,688
[SPEAKER_18]: I mean, she looked shocked.

1012
01:22:17,708 --> 01:22:18,869
[SPEAKER_18]: And that thing had been broken.

1013
01:22:18,989 --> 01:22:21,170
[SPEAKER_18]: I would have never, ever let her forget it.

1014
01:22:21,210 --> 01:22:22,310
[SPEAKER_18]: But she got off lucky.

1015
01:22:22,950 --> 01:22:24,251
[SPEAKER_18]: And it worked just fine.

1016
01:22:24,831 --> 01:22:26,712
[SPEAKER_18]: And we took it apart and gave it a little service.

1017
01:22:26,832 --> 01:22:29,773
[SPEAKER_18]: We didn't take it apart that day.

1018
01:22:29,813 --> 01:22:31,293
[SPEAKER_18]: No, we took it all apart.

1019
01:22:31,394 --> 01:22:32,534
[SPEAKER_18]: We cleaned every button.

1020
01:22:33,044 --> 01:22:34,424
[SPEAKER_18]: and it works a lot better now.

1021
01:22:34,504 --> 01:22:35,385
[SPEAKER_11]: We did that recently.

1022
01:22:35,585 --> 01:22:37,265
[SPEAKER_18]: No, no, we didn't do it that day.

1023
01:22:37,665 --> 01:22:41,346
[SPEAKER_18]: We didn't do any of that bizarre shaving the buttons like some idiots that we know advise us to do.

1024
01:22:41,366 --> 01:22:42,987
[SPEAKER_18]: Which I refuse to.

1025
01:22:43,127 --> 01:22:44,127
[SPEAKER_15]: I didn't shave the buttons.

1026
01:22:44,367 --> 01:22:48,328
[SPEAKER_15]: That's because you're smart.

1027
01:22:48,368 --> 01:22:51,109
[SPEAKER_18]: You should have the mad scientist here build you a real controller.

1028
01:22:51,149 --> 01:22:53,610
[SPEAKER_18]: Take the circuit board out of that old controller.

1029
01:22:53,630 --> 01:22:54,830
[SPEAKER_15]: Because he'll never finish it.

1030
01:22:54,870 --> 01:22:56,770
[SPEAKER_15]: He doesn't finish any of his projects.

1031
01:22:57,090 --> 01:22:59,691
[SPEAKER_15]: The only one he's ever finished is the orange Xbox thing.

1032
01:23:00,931 --> 01:23:02,752
[SPEAKER_15]: Now, now, I finished those pads

1033
01:23:03,160 --> 01:23:03,480
[SPEAKER_15]: Hey, look.

1034
01:23:03,500 --> 01:23:04,281
[SPEAKER_15]: The pads are done.

1035
01:23:04,601 --> 01:23:05,982
[SPEAKER_15]: And they broke after like a week.

1036
01:23:06,162 --> 01:23:07,063
[SPEAKER_13]: They did not break.

1037
01:23:07,103 --> 01:23:08,504
[SPEAKER_13]: They work perfectly fine.

1038
01:23:08,524 --> 01:23:10,706
[SPEAKER_13]: It's just they build up a lot of static electricity.

1039
01:23:11,306 --> 01:23:14,769
[SPEAKER_18]: The trick is to get it done cosmetically before you get it done functionally.

1040
01:23:15,649 --> 01:23:17,471
[SPEAKER_18]: Because it's like your arcade cap.

1041
01:23:17,571 --> 01:23:18,531
[SPEAKER_18]: The thing works.

1042
01:23:19,252 --> 01:23:21,754
[SPEAKER_18]: So it's like, damn, why should I work on it more?

1043
01:23:21,794 --> 01:23:22,294
[SPEAKER_18]: It works.

1044
01:23:22,314 --> 01:23:23,795
[SPEAKER_18]: It doesn't look so great.

1045
01:23:24,776 --> 01:23:25,016
[SPEAKER_15]: All right.

1046
01:23:25,276 --> 01:23:29,059
[SPEAKER_15]: We've got our caller online, our poor caller sitting there just listening to us yell at each other.

1047
01:23:29,539 --> 01:23:29,900
[SPEAKER_15]: Hi.

1048
01:23:30,660 --> 01:23:30,920
[SPEAKER_15]: Hi.

1049
01:23:30,980 --> 01:23:31,561
[SPEAKER_15]: How you doing?

1050
01:23:31,581 --> 01:23:31,661
[SPEAKER_15]: Good.

1051
01:23:32,961 --> 01:23:39,926
[SPEAKER_15]: I will get to that 7th style break at some point because I know you wanted to hear some 7th style music to celebrate your 2DX goodness.

1052
01:23:42,288 --> 01:23:47,572
[SPEAKER_15]: Anything that you think the home versions are lacking versus the arcade version, having played both?

1053
01:23:49,094 --> 01:23:54,438
[SPEAKER_23]: I've had such little experience with the arcade version, I wouldn't know what to say, what to do.

1054
01:23:54,458 --> 01:24:01,183
[SPEAKER_23]: I can't really comment on arcade song list versus home song list because these are the only songs that I know

1055
01:24:02,975 --> 01:24:04,055
[SPEAKER_23]: So politically correct.

1056
01:24:07,438 --> 01:24:14,603
[SPEAKER_23]: I guess if I could say that my controller is a little unresponsive in some portions.

1057
01:24:15,143 --> 01:24:19,006
[SPEAKER_23]: The turntable right now is the bane of my existence.

1058
01:24:19,066 --> 01:24:22,388
[SPEAKER_23]: I'm so tempted to turn on auto-scratch, but then I don't learn anything.

1059
01:24:23,128 --> 01:24:25,330
[SPEAKER_15]: Out of curiosity, what kind of controller did you pick up?

1060
01:24:25,350 --> 01:24:26,751
[SPEAKER_15]: Did you pick up an official Konami one?

1061
01:24:27,429 --> 01:24:28,069
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes, I did.

1062
01:24:28,149 --> 01:24:30,090
[SPEAKER_15]: The official Konami one.

1063
01:24:30,330 --> 01:24:30,790
[SPEAKER_15]: Good for you.

1064
01:24:30,830 --> 01:24:31,691
[SPEAKER_15]: Those are the ones you want to get.

1065
01:24:32,431 --> 01:24:32,831
[SPEAKER_15]: Good job.

1066
01:24:34,051 --> 01:24:37,133
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, and just take very, very good care of it.

1067
01:24:37,213 --> 01:24:41,414
[SPEAKER_15]: Like, seriously, the next one I get, I'm going to put it back in the box every time I play.

1068
01:24:41,454 --> 01:24:51,238
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm going to, like, wrap it back up so that a damn piece of dust does not get into that thing because I don't know how my current controller got ruined, but it's just screwed beyond belief and it makes me sad.

1069
01:24:52,631 --> 01:24:54,252
[SPEAKER_23]: Anything else you want to share with us today, O'Mullet?

1070
01:24:55,813 --> 01:24:57,114
[SPEAKER_23]: That's pretty much it.

1071
01:24:57,214 --> 01:25:02,638
[SPEAKER_23]: I'm in 2DX and I'm not off the DDR bandwagon yet.

1072
01:25:03,158 --> 01:25:04,099
[SPEAKER_15]: Alright, sounds good.

1073
01:25:04,699 --> 01:25:12,065
[SPEAKER_15]: You know, a lot of people when they go over to 2DX, they start adopting that DDR sucks attitude.

1074
01:25:13,185 --> 01:25:18,949
[SPEAKER_23]: Believe it or not, I can kind of see where they're coming from because 2DX is a hell of a lot more challenging than DDR is.

1075
01:25:20,030 --> 01:25:21,211
[SPEAKER_23]: It's a different game.

1076
01:25:22,159 --> 01:25:23,442
[SPEAKER_23]: It's a different game.

1077
01:25:23,582 --> 01:25:24,163
[SPEAKER_23]: Yes, it is.

1078
01:25:24,264 --> 01:25:26,007
[SPEAKER_23]: Comparing apples to oranges.

1079
01:25:34,482 --> 01:25:37,503
[SPEAKER_15]: With DDR, you're moving your whole body.

1080
01:25:37,963 --> 01:25:40,104
[SPEAKER_15]: With 2DX, you're moving your fingers.

1081
01:25:40,524 --> 01:25:47,507
[SPEAKER_15]: Now, granted, it may take longer to get better at this or whatever, but it's certainly a different type of challenge.

1082
01:25:47,847 --> 01:25:57,610
[SPEAKER_15]: Definitely, one of them is challenging your physical ability, while one of them is challenging a little more your musical and rhythmic ability.

1083
01:25:58,071 --> 01:25:59,351
[SPEAKER_15]: So, it's very different.

1084
01:25:59,949 --> 01:26:00,369
[SPEAKER_18]: That's true.

1085
01:26:00,389 --> 01:26:00,930
[SPEAKER_18]: That's true.

1086
01:26:17,600 --> 01:26:19,020
[SPEAKER_18]: and it was fantastic.

1087
01:26:19,281 --> 01:26:20,841
[SPEAKER_18]: It can't be that much harder.

1088
01:26:20,861 --> 01:26:21,761
[SPEAKER_18]: You see like these, what?

1089
01:26:22,181 --> 01:26:22,902
[SPEAKER_18]: What's the biggest song?

1090
01:26:22,942 --> 01:26:24,622
[SPEAKER_18]: Is it like a 10-foot these days?

1091
01:26:24,782 --> 01:26:26,122
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, on DDR?

1092
01:26:26,262 --> 01:26:26,803
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, 10-foot.

1093
01:26:26,823 --> 01:26:29,563
[SPEAKER_18]: You could go over to... It's called like Nuclear-tastic or something?

1094
01:26:29,583 --> 01:26:33,765
[SPEAKER_15]: You could go over to In The Groove and they have like 13s, Pandemonium or something like that.

1095
01:26:33,785 --> 01:26:34,905
[SPEAKER_15]: It's like a super tough song.

1096
01:26:34,925 --> 01:26:38,626
[SPEAKER_18]: I remember watching these people play like, you know, like the 8-foot songs, like in the day.

1097
01:26:38,766 --> 01:26:42,927
[SPEAKER_18]: And I'm watching these songs, like, I don't know, what was the one, Dropout or something like that?

1098
01:26:43,267 --> 01:26:45,648
[SPEAKER_18]: And I'm watching you guys play this and I'm like, oh dear God!

1099
01:26:46,745 --> 01:26:47,666
[SPEAKER_18]: What the hell?

1100
01:26:48,026 --> 01:26:49,607
[SPEAKER_18]: You can't move that fast.

1101
01:26:49,827 --> 01:26:56,811
[SPEAKER_15]: The person that does the 2DX one-handed would go over to DDR and probably... After playing a song.

1102
01:26:57,112 --> 01:27:03,195
[SPEAKER_15]: And the person that plays DDR and plays the 14-footers or whatever would probably go over to 2DX and go, Too many lines!

1103
01:27:03,416 --> 01:27:04,136
[SPEAKER_18]: Too many lines!

1104
01:27:04,736 --> 01:27:06,938
[SPEAKER_23]: That's pretty much how I went into it.

1105
01:27:07,665 --> 01:27:08,706
[SPEAKER_18]: Looks can be deceiving, my friend.

1106
01:27:32,778 --> 01:27:33,919
[SPEAKER_23]: It's the cartoon bunnies.

1107
01:27:33,939 --> 01:27:34,819
[SPEAKER_23]: That's where they get you.

1108
01:27:34,939 --> 01:27:36,540
[SPEAKER_15]: It is all about keyboard mania.

1109
01:27:36,640 --> 01:27:37,780
[SPEAKER_15]: God bless keyboard mania.

1110
01:27:37,840 --> 01:27:38,820
[SPEAKER_15]: Rest your soul in peace.

1111
01:27:38,940 --> 01:27:39,481
[SPEAKER_15]: I miss ye.

1112
01:27:41,361 --> 01:27:42,222
[SPEAKER_20]: Did they kill it?

1113
01:27:42,522 --> 01:27:43,942
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, well, pretty much.

1114
01:27:44,002 --> 01:27:46,823
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, it's on indefinite hiatus, basically.

1115
01:27:47,444 --> 01:27:48,184
[SPEAKER_20]: That means it's dead.

1116
01:27:48,284 --> 01:27:49,164
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, basically.

1117
01:27:51,425 --> 01:27:55,026
[SPEAKER_15]: All right, we're going to let you go because I've got other people that are hammering the lines that want to get in.

1118
01:27:55,166 --> 01:27:56,547
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, yes, please, work in your plug.

1119
01:27:57,688 --> 01:28:00,670
[SPEAKER_23]: InsidePulse.com My column's on Fridays.

1120
01:28:00,850 --> 01:28:01,911
[SPEAKER_23]: Read it, please.

1121
01:28:02,331 --> 01:28:02,991
[SPEAKER_23]: It pays the bills.

1122
01:28:03,031 --> 01:28:04,552
[SPEAKER_23]: No, I don't get paid shit for this.

1123
01:28:05,173 --> 01:28:06,954
[SPEAKER_15]: Are you going to get to go to E3 because of it?

1124
01:28:06,974 --> 01:28:08,094
[SPEAKER_15]: Because you have a column on the intro?

1125
01:28:08,114 --> 01:28:09,375
[SPEAKER_23]: I have final exams.

1126
01:28:09,475 --> 01:28:11,476
[SPEAKER_23]: You poor bastard!

1127
01:28:12,477 --> 01:28:15,399
[SPEAKER_23]: They always organize final exams when E3 is.

1128
01:28:15,419 --> 01:28:16,579
[SPEAKER_23]: I hate my college.

1129
01:28:16,639 --> 01:28:18,781
[SPEAKER_23]: I hate it to death.

1130
01:28:18,841 --> 01:28:19,881
[SPEAKER_15]: How many more years is college?

1131
01:28:21,282 --> 01:28:23,784
[SPEAKER_23]: At the end of this year, I should be out, finally.

1132
01:28:23,884 --> 01:28:24,844
[SPEAKER_15]: Then we'll see you next year.

1133
01:28:25,185 --> 01:28:26,385
[SPEAKER_23]: Alright, have a good one, buddy.

1134
01:28:27,970 --> 01:28:28,190
[SPEAKER_15]: Later.

1135
01:28:28,330 --> 01:28:28,571
[SPEAKER_15]: Later.

1136
01:28:49,574 --> 01:28:58,037
[SPEAKER_26]: Well, my computer was down for a couple of weeks, and then my anime cosplay club, we were getting ready for Capcom, and we were taking Sundays for rehearsals.

1137
01:28:59,337 --> 01:28:59,838
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, okay.

1138
01:28:59,878 --> 01:29:00,918
[SPEAKER_26]: So we got that together, yeah.

1139
01:29:01,078 --> 01:29:06,200
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, people like to use Sunday nights for other things, even though they should understand that this program is on.

1140
01:29:06,260 --> 01:29:07,540
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, hello.

1141
01:29:07,560 --> 01:29:08,621
[SPEAKER_11]: They should all be in church.

1142
01:29:10,221 --> 01:29:11,021
[SPEAKER_15]: Worshipping us.

1143
01:29:11,902 --> 01:29:12,202
[SPEAKER_15]: Just kidding.

1144
01:29:12,222 --> 01:29:13,542
[SPEAKER_26]: Well, this is my church right here.

1145
01:29:13,722 --> 01:29:14,563
[SPEAKER_26]: This is my church.

1146
01:29:14,763 --> 01:29:15,963
[SPEAKER_26]: Church of Orange Lines Radio.

1147
01:29:16,163 --> 01:29:16,763
[SPEAKER_26]: Amen!

1148
01:29:17,144 --> 01:29:17,584
[SPEAKER_26]: Amen!

1149
01:29:18,857 --> 01:29:19,878
[SPEAKER_26]: Can I get an amen?

1150
01:29:20,058 --> 01:29:21,399
[SPEAKER_15]: Testify, my brother.

1151
01:29:23,700 --> 01:29:25,061
[SPEAKER_15]: God, that's a scary notion.

1152
01:29:25,922 --> 01:29:27,563
[SPEAKER_15]: That is a scary-ass notion.

1153
01:29:27,803 --> 01:29:28,564
[SPEAKER_15]: Don't praise us.

1154
01:29:28,924 --> 01:29:29,224
[SPEAKER_15]: Don't.

1155
01:29:29,345 --> 01:29:30,405
[SPEAKER_15]: You being the head of a church?

1156
01:29:30,445 --> 01:29:33,608
[SPEAKER_15]: We're just big, stupid kids like the rest of you.

1157
01:29:33,668 --> 01:29:39,572
[SPEAKER_18]: Rob, you can't deny the financial opportunities in being the head of a church.

1158
01:29:40,512 --> 01:29:44,175
[SPEAKER_18]: Plus, when you get tired of it being a church, it can become a cult.

1159
01:29:44,235 --> 01:29:45,776
[SPEAKER_18]: And then you can be a cult leader.

1160
01:29:45,856 --> 01:29:50,559
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, I'd be one of those churches that would be like on the Daily Show because we have the topless preachers.

1161
01:29:50,679 --> 01:29:54,482
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, that would be... What church is this?

1162
01:29:55,743 --> 01:29:57,064
[SPEAKER_19]: That's what I'm talking about.

1163
01:29:58,062 --> 01:30:00,823
[SPEAKER_19]: Well, if you guys were a church, it'd be a tax write-off.

1164
01:30:01,223 --> 01:30:02,423
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh my God, he's got a point.

1165
01:30:03,723 --> 01:30:06,564
[SPEAKER_15]: If we were a church, we could write this shit off on our taxes.

1166
01:30:06,584 --> 01:30:07,564
[SPEAKER_18]: That's what I was telling you.

1167
01:30:07,584 --> 01:30:09,864
[SPEAKER_18]: You can't deny the financial opportunity.

1168
01:30:09,924 --> 01:30:10,925
[SPEAKER_18]: Can I get an amen?

1169
01:30:11,685 --> 01:30:16,966
[SPEAKER_11]: There's a guy I met at Coast Con eight years ago who has the Church of the Great Green Frog.

1170
01:30:18,026 --> 01:30:20,387
[SPEAKER_11]: He did it just so he could have the tax write-off.

1171
01:30:20,627 --> 01:30:23,407
[SPEAKER_11]: And he was going around passing Get Out of Hell free cards.

1172
01:30:25,168 --> 01:30:27,348
[SPEAKER_18]: There is a first church of Pac-Man as well.

1173
01:30:28,070 --> 01:30:30,231
[SPEAKER_11]: There's also the Partridge Family Cult.

1174
01:30:31,672 --> 01:30:34,033
[SPEAKER_11]: I kid you not, the Partridge Family Cult exists.

1175
01:30:34,073 --> 01:30:34,633
[SPEAKER_25]: That's hot.

1176
01:30:36,714 --> 01:30:44,898
[SPEAKER_11]: It fully looked like the Monopoly card, except it had a frog with wings, wearing a tuxedo, and it was the Church of the Great Green Frog.

1177
01:30:46,018 --> 01:30:47,499
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm going to see if he has a website.

1178
01:30:49,120 --> 01:30:52,762
[SPEAKER_15]: Anyway, before we got off on that tangent, how was the convention that you went to?

1179
01:30:53,722 --> 01:30:54,623
[SPEAKER_26]: It was really good.

1180
01:30:55,023 --> 01:30:57,704
[SPEAKER_26]: Some people complained it was in two different hotels, but

1181
01:30:58,191 --> 01:30:59,491
[SPEAKER_26]: I had a great time overall.

1182
01:30:59,751 --> 01:31:03,412
[SPEAKER_26]: It was packed as hell and it was tons of Naruto cosplayers.

1183
01:31:03,692 --> 01:31:04,712
[SPEAKER_26]: Gee, I wonder why.

1184
01:31:05,292 --> 01:31:07,533
[SPEAKER_15]: Could it be because it was NarutoCon?

1185
01:31:08,553 --> 01:31:10,794
[SPEAKER_26]: That and it was licensed just that week.

1186
01:31:11,674 --> 01:31:12,594
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, yeah, that's right.

1187
01:31:12,894 --> 01:31:13,494
[SPEAKER_15]: I heard that news.

1188
01:31:13,534 --> 01:31:14,114
[SPEAKER_15]: Very cool.

1189
01:31:15,094 --> 01:31:17,875
[SPEAKER_26]: Yeah, we got together for the giant photo shoot.

1190
01:31:17,895 --> 01:31:19,435
[SPEAKER_26]: There was about 200 of us.

1191
01:31:19,815 --> 01:31:21,296
[SPEAKER_26]: We're all in front of the hotel.

1192
01:31:21,696 --> 01:31:24,976
[SPEAKER_26]: People that want to take our pictures are going into the streets.

1193
01:31:25,337 --> 01:31:27,517
[SPEAKER_26]: We're telling people to drive around us.

1194
01:31:28,143 --> 01:31:29,906
[SPEAKER_26]: Security's coming out settling us out.

1195
01:31:29,926 --> 01:31:30,647
[SPEAKER_26]: You gotta move.

1196
01:31:30,687 --> 01:31:31,268
[SPEAKER_26]: You gotta move.

1197
01:31:31,548 --> 01:31:32,450
[SPEAKER_26]: There's 200 of us.

1198
01:31:32,730 --> 01:31:34,513
[SPEAKER_26]: Where are we going to move to?

1199
01:31:34,713 --> 01:31:38,118
[SPEAKER_15]: Were they taking pictures, like, for promotional purposes as well?

1200
01:31:38,138 --> 01:31:39,140
[SPEAKER_15]: Like, are you gonna be famous?

1201
01:31:40,330 --> 01:31:43,531
[SPEAKER_26]: No, it was a giant Naruto cosplay photo shoot.

1202
01:31:43,831 --> 01:31:44,171
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, okay.

1203
01:31:44,231 --> 01:31:45,492
[SPEAKER_26]: Everybody wanted to jump in on it.

1204
01:31:45,592 --> 01:31:46,452
[SPEAKER_15]: That's still pretty cool.

1205
01:31:46,672 --> 01:31:47,092
[SPEAKER_15]: Very cool.

1206
01:31:47,212 --> 01:31:50,633
[SPEAKER_26]: Yeah, I can post links to some pictures if you'd like later.

1207
01:31:50,994 --> 01:31:51,834
[SPEAKER_15]: Post them in the chat room.

1208
01:31:51,854 --> 01:31:52,834
[SPEAKER_15]: Let our chatters check it out.

1209
01:31:52,854 --> 01:31:53,314
[SPEAKER_15]: It'd be cool.

1210
01:31:53,574 --> 01:31:54,695
[SPEAKER_26]: That I will in just a bit.

1211
01:31:54,855 --> 01:31:56,275
[SPEAKER_15]: All right, sounds good.

1212
01:31:56,735 --> 01:31:58,276
[SPEAKER_26]: Any video gaming going on at the convention?

1213
01:31:59,456 --> 01:32:01,757
[SPEAKER_26]: I couldn't even make it over to the gaming section.

1214
01:32:01,917 --> 01:32:07,459
[SPEAKER_26]: All I know is that if it was the same setup like last year, it was like maybe...

1215
01:32:08,106 --> 01:32:12,467
[SPEAKER_26]: There's probably one American Idol set up, two Karaoke Revolution.

1216
01:32:12,487 --> 01:32:12,927
[SPEAKER_15]: Wait, wait, wait.

1217
01:32:13,007 --> 01:32:14,007
[SPEAKER_15]: American Idol?

1218
01:32:14,687 --> 01:32:14,947
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

1219
01:32:15,248 --> 01:32:16,348
[SPEAKER_15]: At one of these conventions?

1220
01:32:16,408 --> 01:32:17,388
[SPEAKER_15]: What the heck?

1221
01:32:17,648 --> 01:32:18,588
[SPEAKER_15]: That's not Japanese.

1222
01:32:18,668 --> 01:32:19,148
[SPEAKER_15]: What is that?

1223
01:32:19,949 --> 01:32:20,929
[SPEAKER_15]: That's crap.

1224
01:32:21,989 --> 01:32:24,249
[SPEAKER_26]: After Gwen Stefani's CD, I'm calling.

1225
01:32:24,930 --> 01:32:27,850
[SPEAKER_26]: They're going to try to get her to come to a con to sing any of those songs.

1226
01:32:29,751 --> 01:32:30,191
[SPEAKER_26]: And I'm done.

1227
01:32:30,251 --> 01:32:31,291
[SPEAKER_26]: That's when I'll retire.

1228
01:32:31,747 --> 01:32:32,127
[SPEAKER_15]: Wow.

1229
01:32:32,507 --> 01:32:33,268
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, okay.

1230
01:32:33,588 --> 01:32:39,931
[SPEAKER_15]: I think you were breaking up a little bit there, but I picked up most of that, I think, about the Gwen Stefani CD and after her latest inspirations and everything.

1231
01:32:40,691 --> 01:32:41,511
[SPEAKER_15]: Very interesting.

1232
01:32:41,571 --> 01:32:41,891
[SPEAKER_15]: Wow.

1233
01:32:43,632 --> 01:32:43,932
[SPEAKER_15]: All right.

1234
01:32:46,113 --> 01:32:47,574
[SPEAKER_15]: Anything else you wanted to share with us tonight?

1235
01:32:47,594 --> 01:32:48,014
[SPEAKER_15]: What are you calling?

1236
01:32:49,255 --> 01:32:50,055
[SPEAKER_26]: The skit that we did.

1237
01:32:51,076 --> 01:32:53,036
[SPEAKER_26]: We did Naruto 2 Ninja Rap.

1238
01:32:53,116 --> 01:32:55,297
[SPEAKER_26]: We won Best Technical Job.

1239
01:32:55,978 --> 01:32:57,218
[SPEAKER_15]: Best Technical Job.

1240
01:32:57,498 --> 01:33:01,200
[SPEAKER_15]: What exactly is the technical component of a skit at an anime convention?

1241
01:33:01,840 --> 01:33:07,763
[SPEAKER_26]: The fact that the tech group loved the fact that they were able to post GoNinjaGo on the big screens while we were dancing.

1242
01:33:08,644 --> 01:33:09,404
[SPEAKER_15]: That's very cool.

1243
01:33:10,265 --> 01:33:10,605
[SPEAKER_26]: Yeah.

1244
01:33:11,225 --> 01:33:11,785
[SPEAKER_15]: Very cool.

1245
01:33:13,266 --> 01:33:14,907
[SPEAKER_15]: Alright, well congratulations on the award.

1246
01:33:14,967 --> 01:33:15,687
[SPEAKER_15]: What did you get for that?

1247
01:33:17,508 --> 01:33:18,929
[SPEAKER_26]: We just got a trophy, that was it.

1248
01:33:19,069 --> 01:33:21,130
[SPEAKER_26]: It seems that cons are getting cheaper and cheaper.

1249
01:33:21,150 --> 01:33:26,153
[SPEAKER_26]: I remember when you won, they gave you like a box set and a stack of music and other stuff.

1250
01:33:26,213 --> 01:33:27,194
[SPEAKER_26]: Now it's just a certificate.

1251
01:33:27,234 --> 01:33:30,095
[SPEAKER_15]: Hey, you got a NarutoCon trophy.

1252
01:33:30,195 --> 01:33:31,396
[SPEAKER_15]: Who needs a fucking Oscar, right?

1253
01:33:32,571 --> 01:33:32,931
[SPEAKER_26]: True.

1254
01:33:34,552 --> 01:33:35,553
[SPEAKER_26]: I have my fandom.

1255
01:33:36,234 --> 01:33:36,774
[SPEAKER_15]: There you go.

1256
01:33:37,274 --> 01:33:40,176
[SPEAKER_15]: Alright, before I let you go, can I get an amen?

1257
01:33:41,317 --> 01:33:41,838
[SPEAKER_26]: Amen!

1258
01:33:41,958 --> 01:33:42,558
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you very much.

1259
01:33:42,578 --> 01:33:43,039
[SPEAKER_15]: Have a good one.

1260
01:33:43,739 --> 01:33:44,099
[SPEAKER_15]: You too.

1261
01:33:44,219 --> 01:33:44,540
[SPEAKER_15]: Later.

1262
01:33:44,620 --> 01:33:45,040
[SPEAKER_18]: Laters.

1263
01:33:45,260 --> 01:33:45,560
[SPEAKER_18]: Bye.

1264
01:33:46,821 --> 01:33:52,405
[SPEAKER_18]: I'd like it to be said that that whole phone call is like why I don't go to anime conventions anymore.

1265
01:33:52,926 --> 01:33:53,366
[SPEAKER_15]: Why not?

1266
01:33:54,587 --> 01:33:56,668
[SPEAKER_18]: Have you been to an anime convention?

1267
01:33:56,848 --> 01:33:57,509
[SPEAKER_15]: Not in a long time.

1268
01:33:57,529 --> 01:33:58,430
[SPEAKER_15]: Wait, hold on there, caller.

1269
01:33:59,170 --> 01:34:00,351
[SPEAKER_15]: Not in a long time.

1270
01:34:01,212 --> 01:34:01,692
[SPEAKER_18]: The skit

1271
01:34:02,540 --> 01:34:03,241
[SPEAKER_18]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura.com

1272
01:34:20,698 --> 01:34:22,340
[SPEAKER_18]: All this jive about Dillager

1273
01:34:46,733 --> 01:34:48,095
[SPEAKER_15]: Liz, waiting for us to shut up.

1274
01:34:48,316 --> 01:34:50,960
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm sorry, Zach, I will shut up now so you can talk.

1275
01:34:51,040 --> 01:34:52,061
[SPEAKER_17]: What's on your mind?

1276
01:34:53,203 --> 01:34:54,505
[SPEAKER_17]: It needs to be the legend of hang-ups.

1277
01:34:55,896 --> 01:35:01,120
[SPEAKER_22]: All this jive about Dillinger's skate plan song on Guitar Freaks and Drum Mania.

1278
01:35:01,420 --> 01:35:04,763
[SPEAKER_22]: The fact that it was basically shunned upon in this chatroom, no offense.

1279
01:35:05,824 --> 01:35:11,488
[SPEAKER_22]: And, you know, I as a metalhead, I mean, what's the deal with the rest of the chatroom?

1280
01:35:11,508 --> 01:35:18,434
[SPEAKER_22]: Why is, like, you know, it's almost split, let alone almost, you know, leaning towards hatred towards this song.

1281
01:35:18,494 --> 01:35:19,855
[SPEAKER_15]: You know what, Zaku?

1282
01:35:19,935 --> 01:35:21,496
[SPEAKER_22]: I sense a bunch of haters about this.

1283
01:35:22,588 --> 01:35:23,088
[SPEAKER_15]: But think about it Skye

1284
01:35:46,721 --> 01:35:57,606
[SPEAKER_22]: Think about it, I mean, you have a song, you have Konami right here, who's basically has the balls to even license a song in the first place, so that way they could attract a newer, you know, newer type of group.

1285
01:35:57,626 --> 01:36:00,907
[SPEAKER_22]: They're being very eclectic with the songs that they have so far.

1286
01:36:01,607 --> 01:36:05,449
[SPEAKER_22]: And so, you know, in this, if they were to go stateside with Good Adoram...

1287
01:36:06,172 --> 01:36:08,193
[SPEAKER_22]: They'll pick up the metalheads like that if they have that song.

1288
01:36:08,433 --> 01:36:10,334
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, here's my thought.

1289
01:36:10,394 --> 01:36:17,738
[SPEAKER_15]: If they have the balls to license that song, I mean, as interesting of a selection as it is or whatever, why don't they have the balls to put out a new DDR?

1290
01:36:19,378 --> 01:36:20,679
[SPEAKER_18]: Now, let's go ahead and stop right there, okay?

1291
01:36:20,699 --> 01:36:25,341
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, that's a different story, but... No self-respecting metalhead will ever play Guitar Freaks.

1292
01:36:25,361 --> 01:36:28,803
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, that's a different story, but regarding this one... Ever.

1293
01:36:29,603 --> 01:36:31,744
[SPEAKER_15]: Now, that's a pretty controversial point, Dan.

1294
01:36:31,784 --> 01:36:34,906
[SPEAKER_15]: What makes you say that no metalhead would ever play Guitar Freaks?

1295
01:36:35,865 --> 01:36:39,508
[SPEAKER_18]: Because let's be honest, Guitar Freaks is silly.

1296
01:36:39,688 --> 01:36:42,650
[SPEAKER_18]: You're playing this plastic guitar.

1297
01:36:42,691 --> 01:36:45,313
[SPEAKER_22]: How about Drum Mania?

1298
01:36:45,353 --> 01:36:48,055
[SPEAKER_18]: Now Drum Mania is a lot cooler than Guitar Freaks.

1299
01:36:48,075 --> 01:36:50,056
[SPEAKER_18]: Drum Mania is actually hammered on a drum.

1300
01:36:50,277 --> 01:36:54,380
[SPEAKER_18]: I can see somebody being like, you know, Guitar Freaks.

1301
01:36:54,440 --> 01:36:55,701
[SPEAKER_18]: I play Guitar Freaks at home, right?

1302
01:36:55,721 --> 01:36:57,522
[SPEAKER_18]: And I got my little plastic ukulele.

1303
01:36:58,263 --> 01:37:01,606
[SPEAKER_18]: And I'm wailing out hard to whatever song I can play on the home version.

1304
01:37:03,362 --> 01:37:05,646
[SPEAKER_18]: and I'm like, dude, I look stupid.

1305
01:37:06,748 --> 01:37:08,432
[SPEAKER_18]: But in my mind, you know, I'm like...

1306
01:37:08,973 --> 01:37:10,274
[SPEAKER_18]: You know, a god of rock.

1307
01:37:10,995 --> 01:37:12,676
[SPEAKER_18]: And that's awesome.

1308
01:37:12,756 --> 01:37:14,738
[SPEAKER_18]: But it's like, you're going to get a metalhead, right?

1309
01:37:14,798 --> 01:37:19,261
[SPEAKER_18]: A real metalhead, which there aren't any more real metalheads.

1310
01:37:19,281 --> 01:37:21,563
[SPEAKER_22]: People who play the guitars are metalheads.

1311
01:37:21,643 --> 01:37:23,204
[SPEAKER_22]: People who play in a band are metalheads.

1312
01:37:23,224 --> 01:37:25,406
[SPEAKER_18]: The people who are real metalheads play the guitar.

1313
01:37:25,426 --> 01:37:27,248
[SPEAKER_18]: They don't play the guitar for you.

1314
01:37:27,268 --> 01:37:28,389
[SPEAKER_22]: They play the real drums.

1315
01:37:28,509 --> 01:37:29,269
[SPEAKER_22]: They play bass.

1316
01:37:29,349 --> 01:37:30,130
[SPEAKER_22]: They play all that.

1317
01:37:30,170 --> 01:37:30,951
[SPEAKER_22]: They're in a band.

1318
01:37:31,291 --> 01:37:33,793
[SPEAKER_15]: I've seen guys with mullets playing guitar freaks.

1319
01:37:35,304 --> 01:37:36,685
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh yeah, but no, no, no.

1320
01:37:36,805 --> 01:37:38,725
[SPEAKER_18]: Bullet and Metalhead, well, okay.

1321
01:37:39,646 --> 01:37:43,107
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, gotcha.

1322
01:37:43,527 --> 01:37:44,027
[SPEAKER_22]: Think about it.

1323
01:37:44,307 --> 01:37:47,769
[SPEAKER_22]: Think about the metalheads that play not only DDR, but Bomani games in general.

1324
01:37:48,089 --> 01:37:48,509
[SPEAKER_22]: Like me.

1325
01:37:49,389 --> 01:37:53,231
[SPEAKER_22]: You know, it started off with DDR, and then it moved on to other games, like 2DX.

1326
01:37:53,251 --> 01:37:55,211
[SPEAKER_17]: And you never see a metalhead playing DDR.

1327
01:37:56,572 --> 01:37:56,872
[SPEAKER_17]: Ever.

1328
01:37:56,892 --> 01:37:59,353
[SPEAKER_17]: But Zaku is saying he is a metalhead who's playing DDR.

1329
01:37:59,373 --> 01:37:59,993
[SPEAKER_17]: Zaku's a faker.

1330
01:38:02,082 --> 01:38:05,544
[SPEAKER_18]: Metalheads do two things, right?

1331
01:38:05,864 --> 01:38:08,906
[SPEAKER_18]: They smoke weed, and they listen to metal.

1332
01:38:09,486 --> 01:38:10,127
[SPEAKER_22]: And that's it.

1333
01:38:10,327 --> 01:38:11,647
[SPEAKER_22]: That is a stereotype.

1334
01:38:12,108 --> 01:38:13,128
[SPEAKER_22]: Hey, man.

1335
01:38:13,148 --> 01:38:13,809
[SPEAKER_22]: That's bull, man.

1336
01:38:13,829 --> 01:38:14,429
[SPEAKER_22]: It's just a stereotype.

1337
01:38:14,469 --> 01:38:16,690
[SPEAKER_22]: It wouldn't be a stereotype if it wasn't true.

1338
01:38:17,090 --> 01:38:24,855
[SPEAKER_22]: You'd be surprised at the number of people that play DDR, not just regular... No, no, I wouldn't be... Trust me, I wouldn't be surprised at the number of people who play DDR.

1339
01:38:25,315 --> 01:38:30,118
[SPEAKER_18]: I'd be surprised at the number of Metalheads who play DDR, because as far as I'm concerned, that number is zero.

1340
01:38:30,238 --> 01:38:30,438
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

1341
01:38:31,448 --> 01:38:33,509
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, no, you got one right here.

1342
01:38:33,669 --> 01:38:35,570
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay, Zaku, congratulations.

1343
01:38:35,610 --> 01:38:37,531
[SPEAKER_18]: You are the exception that proves the rule.

1344
01:38:38,051 --> 01:38:38,572
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm wrong.

1345
01:38:39,212 --> 01:38:47,837
[SPEAKER_18]: Metalheads are rushing to arcades right now to throw down the Mad Dance Dance action.

1346
01:38:47,857 --> 01:38:56,921
[SPEAKER_18]: Because, you know, the brand of electronic hip-hop, or not even hip-hop, electronic pop music inside of it, really appeals to the rocker and their soul.

1347
01:38:58,362 --> 01:38:59,983
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, but we're different.

1348
01:39:01,004 --> 01:39:02,508
[SPEAKER_22]: Well, we play DDR, remember that.

1349
01:39:03,289 --> 01:39:03,931
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes, you are.

1350
01:39:04,372 --> 01:39:09,844
[SPEAKER_13]: Dude, nothing like B4U, the fucking J-pop metalhead rockers.

1351
01:39:09,884 --> 01:39:10,987
[SPEAKER_18]: That's what I'm talking about!

1352
01:39:11,553 --> 01:39:12,434
[SPEAKER_18]: You know it's true.

1353
01:39:12,734 --> 01:39:19,758
[SPEAKER_18]: There is no self-respecting metalhead who would hear the music from a B-Mani machine and not run over and kill it.

1354
01:39:19,978 --> 01:39:27,642
[SPEAKER_18]: Now maybe that one song we just heard might be the beginning of the metalhead B-Mani renaissance.

1355
01:39:28,223 --> 01:39:29,323
[SPEAKER_15]: It's not happening.

1356
01:39:29,583 --> 01:39:32,105
[SPEAKER_15]: I need to clarify something for Zaku.

1357
01:39:32,425 --> 01:39:35,687
[SPEAKER_15]: We've made careers out of taking things out of context, okay?

1358
01:39:36,327 --> 01:39:37,408
[SPEAKER_15]: Politicians do it every day.

1359
01:39:39,082 --> 01:39:48,826
[SPEAKER_18]: And incidentally, the opinions of my fucked up self are in no way, shape, or form the opinions of Orange Lounge Radio or anybody else in the whole damn world.

1360
01:39:48,846 --> 01:39:50,066
[SPEAKER_18]: But they're pretty damn funny.

1361
01:39:50,246 --> 01:39:52,207
[SPEAKER_18]: Exactly, I agree with that.

1362
01:39:52,247 --> 01:39:53,207
[SPEAKER_18]: Quit fucking on my program.

1363
01:39:53,487 --> 01:39:58,869
[SPEAKER_22]: The fact of the matter is this, you know, there's not only two metalheads or any other type of people playing EDR.

1364
01:39:58,889 --> 01:40:00,449
[SPEAKER_18]: You're taking off his headset.

1365
01:40:00,469 --> 01:40:01,990
[SPEAKER_22]: People who listen to rap music, yes.

1366
01:40:02,719 --> 01:40:09,261
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, no, rap people playing DDR, you know, punks, scots, metalheads, as I said before.

1367
01:40:09,541 --> 01:40:10,602
[SPEAKER_22]: Almost everyone plays DDR.

1368
01:40:10,622 --> 01:40:11,462
[SPEAKER_18]: Don't forget bags.

1369
01:40:11,482 --> 01:40:12,222
[SPEAKER_22]: You might not know it.

1370
01:40:12,883 --> 01:40:13,303
[SPEAKER_18]: Exactly.

1371
01:40:13,323 --> 01:40:15,263
[SPEAKER_18]: That too.

1372
01:40:15,844 --> 01:40:16,304
[SPEAKER_22]: Oh yeah!

1373
01:40:16,484 --> 01:40:16,884
[SPEAKER_18]: Woo!

1374
01:40:16,904 --> 01:40:17,284
[SPEAKER_18]: Woo!

1375
01:40:17,304 --> 01:40:18,084
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah!

1376
01:40:18,244 --> 01:40:21,346
[SPEAKER_18]: Woo!

1377
01:40:21,386 --> 01:40:27,448
[SPEAKER_06]: That's just killing it, man.

1378
01:40:28,568 --> 01:40:29,368
[SPEAKER_22]: That's just killing it.

1379
01:40:30,009 --> 01:40:30,949
[SPEAKER_22]: You just killed it right there.

1380
01:40:32,066 --> 01:40:32,386
[SPEAKER_22]: Sorry.

1381
01:40:32,986 --> 01:40:35,027
[SPEAKER_22]: Konami has the balls to go that far.

1382
01:40:35,187 --> 01:40:37,108
[SPEAKER_22]: I mean, you know, live with it.

1383
01:40:37,148 --> 01:40:38,409
[SPEAKER_22]: I mean, that's what they did.

1384
01:40:38,789 --> 01:40:39,689
[SPEAKER_22]: It's already been done.

1385
01:40:39,789 --> 01:40:43,631
[SPEAKER_22]: The license has already been acquired and it's going to be in there no matter what you say.

1386
01:40:44,952 --> 01:40:45,332
[SPEAKER_22]: That's it.

1387
01:40:45,352 --> 01:40:50,214
[SPEAKER_18]: Seriously, I've been arguing for years that there needs to be more metal music in Guitar Freaks.

1388
01:40:50,774 --> 01:40:52,075
[SPEAKER_18]: Because it would appeal to me.

1389
01:40:53,876 --> 01:40:57,277
[SPEAKER_18]: But again, I can't really see a real metalhead going out there playing.

1390
01:40:57,817 --> 01:40:59,118
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, but you don't know that for sure.

1391
01:40:59,682 --> 01:41:03,483
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm sorry if I'm talking over you, Rob's computer's crossing around.

1392
01:41:03,863 --> 01:41:07,545
[SPEAKER_22]: You have to think of, you know, take for a second and think of, you know, Konami's rationale.

1393
01:41:07,905 --> 01:41:11,326
[SPEAKER_22]: What do they want out of, you know, out of Guitar Freaks and any other Bomani game?

1394
01:41:11,546 --> 01:41:12,446
[SPEAKER_22]: You know, more people.

1395
01:41:12,926 --> 01:41:17,388
[SPEAKER_22]: They would sure, in most cases, they would love to pick up, you know, many types of people.

1396
01:41:17,608 --> 01:41:23,770
[SPEAKER_22]: Not just, you know, the typical, you know, typical regular person who probably doesn't listen to metal, but just, you know, a new type.

1397
01:41:24,490 --> 01:41:26,050
[SPEAKER_22]: Spread out their bass a little.

1398
01:41:26,551 --> 01:41:27,671
[SPEAKER_22]: So that way they get everyone.

1399
01:41:28,154 --> 01:41:30,956
[SPEAKER_22]: and they get more, you know, and that's more, you know, more sales than that.

1400
01:41:30,976 --> 01:41:31,837
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, you know what?

1401
01:41:32,077 --> 01:41:32,498
[SPEAKER_15]: You know what?

1402
01:41:32,818 --> 01:41:35,120
[SPEAKER_15]: The bottom line is, and we gotta move on soon.

1403
01:41:35,420 --> 01:41:44,908
[SPEAKER_15]: As much as I enjoy it when you call into the show, Saku, because damn, I haven't laughed this hard in months.

1404
01:41:45,048 --> 01:41:50,673
[SPEAKER_15]: I think the Gita Dora mix is promising to be a very diverse selection of music.

1405
01:41:51,654 --> 01:41:53,736
[SPEAKER_15]: And if we win over some metalheads...

1406
01:41:54,440 --> 01:41:55,321
[SPEAKER_15]: Then, hey, great.

1407
01:41:55,461 --> 01:41:58,104
[SPEAKER_15]: And if we don't, well, we always have the fags, right?

1408
01:41:58,544 --> 01:42:00,326
[SPEAKER_22]: I mean, yeah.

1409
01:42:00,426 --> 01:42:01,667
[SPEAKER_22]: It wins for everyone.

1410
01:42:01,707 --> 01:42:04,970
[SPEAKER_22]: Because, you know, the more it's eclectic, the more everyone will join in.

1411
01:42:05,251 --> 01:42:11,857
[SPEAKER_18]: Incidentally, since the games aren't meant for America anyway, they're just appealing to the Japanese metalhead.

1412
01:42:11,897 --> 01:42:13,919
[SPEAKER_18]: And the Japanese metalhead is stuck in 1988.

1413
01:42:16,267 --> 01:42:17,748
[SPEAKER_18]: When metal was metal.

1414
01:42:17,848 --> 01:42:18,970
[SPEAKER_17]: That is a very good observation.

1415
01:42:19,250 --> 01:42:22,193
[SPEAKER_18]: Before it was... On that note... More 80s rock.

1416
01:42:22,533 --> 01:42:24,596
[SPEAKER_17]: On that note, Zach... Guitar freaks.

1417
01:42:31,823 --> 01:42:32,924
[SPEAKER_18]: and I'm putting up the horns.

1418
01:42:32,964 --> 01:42:33,745
[SPEAKER_18]: Watch the webcam.

1419
01:42:33,765 --> 01:42:34,285
[SPEAKER_18]: The horns are up.

1420
01:42:34,305 --> 01:42:35,626
[SPEAKER_22]: I think we should bury the hatchet right now.

1421
01:42:35,666 --> 01:42:36,266
[SPEAKER_22]: I think it's done.

1422
01:42:36,306 --> 01:42:38,508
[SPEAKER_22]: I think I flamed and ranted long enough.

1423
01:42:38,868 --> 01:42:39,949
[SPEAKER_22]: I made my point clear.

1424
01:42:40,169 --> 01:42:42,671
[SPEAKER_22]: Alright.

1425
01:42:42,872 --> 01:42:44,653
[SPEAKER_15]: Have a good one, Zaku.

1426
01:42:44,693 --> 01:42:47,475
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you for your... Have a good one.

1427
01:42:47,775 --> 01:42:48,096
[SPEAKER_15]: Later.

1428
01:42:48,476 --> 01:42:48,776
[SPEAKER_15]: Bye.

1429
01:42:50,277 --> 01:42:51,718
[SPEAKER_15]: I can hear that a little bit, by the way.

1430
01:42:51,978 --> 01:42:52,239
[SPEAKER_15]: Alright.

1431
01:42:53,780 --> 01:42:54,300
[SPEAKER_15]: Wow.

1432
01:42:58,023 --> 01:42:59,584
[SPEAKER_15]: Damn, you need to come visit us more often.

1433
01:42:59,604 --> 01:43:00,645
[SPEAKER_15]: That was good stuff.

1434
01:43:01,386 --> 01:43:01,726
[SPEAKER_15]: Alright.

1435
01:43:02,728 --> 01:43:04,914
[SPEAKER_15]: I need a break after that, I need to breathe a little bit

1436
01:43:06,105 --> 01:43:09,946
[SPEAKER_15]: We'll open up the Skype line later for more of you guys who want to call in.

1437
01:43:10,326 --> 01:43:12,047
[SPEAKER_15]: In the meantime, though, we've got a cage match to get to.

1438
01:43:12,087 --> 01:43:14,848
[SPEAKER_15]: We want to get to the FUs of the week as well and some other news.

1439
01:43:15,248 --> 01:43:17,429
[SPEAKER_15]: Maybe we'll have time for a DDR Freak post of the week.

1440
01:43:17,529 --> 01:43:17,849
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't know.

1441
01:43:17,869 --> 01:43:18,269
[SPEAKER_15]: We'll see.

1442
01:43:18,369 --> 01:43:21,130
[SPEAKER_15]: Speaking of DDR Freak, Friday nights, check it out.

1443
01:43:21,230 --> 01:43:22,330
[SPEAKER_15]: Orange Lounge Radio Rewind.

1444
01:43:22,530 --> 01:43:25,091
[SPEAKER_15]: Maybe you are checking us out right now on the Rewind over there.

1445
01:43:25,631 --> 01:43:33,414
[SPEAKER_15]: We appreciate their support in helping us out and their efforts to help us convert people to the Church of Orange Lounge.

1446
01:43:33,434 --> 01:43:34,254
[SPEAKER_26]: Can I get an amen?

1447
01:43:35,704 --> 01:43:36,165
[SPEAKER_26]: Amen!

1448
01:44:07,075 --> 01:44:08,476
Thank you for watching!

Thanks for watching!

[SPEAKER_06]: Baby it's on, let's go

Thanks for watching!

Thanks for watching!

1457
01:52:06,092 --> 01:52:09,535
[SPEAKER_15]: We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio.

1458
01:52:10,836 --> 01:52:12,577
[SPEAKER_15]: After, oh man, I had to catch my breath.

1459
01:52:12,637 --> 01:52:14,098
[SPEAKER_15]: I was just laughing so hard.

1460
01:52:14,398 --> 01:52:15,299
[SPEAKER_15]: Dan, you crack me up.

1461
01:52:15,599 --> 01:52:16,200
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm glad you're here.

1462
01:52:16,300 --> 01:52:17,080
[SPEAKER_18]: That's what I do.

1463
01:52:17,261 --> 01:52:17,901
[SPEAKER_15]: You want to laugh?

1464
01:52:18,101 --> 01:52:22,404
[SPEAKER_15]: Go buy an ignition pad at the Marconi GameStop.

1465
01:52:22,645 --> 01:52:25,327
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll be the first in line to be berated by Dan.

1466
01:52:25,427 --> 01:52:25,887
[SPEAKER_15]: That's right.

1467
01:52:26,167 --> 01:52:28,789
[SPEAKER_15]: Dan will berate you and your taste in music in person.

1468
01:52:28,829 --> 01:52:33,173
[SPEAKER_18]: Only if you step up saying, I'm the DDR playing metal freak.

1469
01:52:36,764 --> 01:52:37,104
[SPEAKER_15]: You know what?

1470
01:52:37,164 --> 01:52:41,828
[SPEAKER_15]: At the next DDR tournament, I'm going to find a bunch of metalheads to, you know, send you a special FU.

1471
01:52:41,848 --> 01:52:43,970
[SPEAKER_18]: Zaku's already proven that he's the exception to the rule.

1472
01:52:44,330 --> 01:52:47,333
[SPEAKER_15]: I think we can find at least one other.

1473
01:52:47,353 --> 01:52:51,016
[SPEAKER_18]: There was another guy in the chatroom saying that he was... I'm saying my argument is now null and void.

1474
01:52:51,817 --> 01:52:55,480
[SPEAKER_18]: I said no metalheads are Bimani fans, and he said I'm a metalhead, I don't want to be a metalhead.

1475
01:52:55,700 --> 01:52:57,461
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't have a way to disprove his metalness.

1476
01:52:58,182 --> 01:53:01,144
[SPEAKER_18]: I can't say that his Bimaniness makes him less of a metalhead.

1477
01:53:01,485 --> 01:53:05,348
[SPEAKER_18]: The truth is the guy might eat, sleep, and breathe metal and then go out and play DDR.

1478
01:53:05,888 --> 01:53:08,650
[SPEAKER_18]: Maybe he puts on a Walkman and listens to metal while he's playing DDR.

1479
01:53:08,670 --> 01:53:10,031
[SPEAKER_18]: So basically you got pwned.

1480
01:53:10,512 --> 01:53:11,092
[SPEAKER_18]: I got told.

1481
01:53:11,633 --> 01:53:12,373
[SPEAKER_18]: That's what I said.

1482
01:53:12,413 --> 01:53:14,595
[SPEAKER_18]: You know, you said, I'm metalhead.

1483
01:53:14,635 --> 01:53:15,836
[SPEAKER_18]: I said, oh, I guess I'm wrong.

1484
01:53:16,056 --> 01:53:16,557
[SPEAKER_18]: I got told.

1485
01:53:17,117 --> 01:53:17,517
[SPEAKER_15]: All right.

1486
01:53:18,538 --> 01:53:20,660
[SPEAKER_15]: Loki, you were wanting to mention something there?

1487
01:53:23,142 --> 01:53:24,943
[SPEAKER_15]: Crap, I don't even remember now.

1488
01:53:26,545 --> 01:53:28,066
[SPEAKER_19]: Damn, I don't remember.

1489
01:53:28,706 --> 01:53:52,954
[SPEAKER_13]: I just tried to blank I was, I'm sure I was I appreciate it I don't want to alienate the listeners I cannot remember what the hell I was thinking It just like, poof, went away Oh, now I remember, now I remember I was just going to say, yeah, Metalhead's playing DDR That was like the black people watching the films nominated for the Oscars As Chris Rock was pointing out in the beginning of the Oscars That was great

1490
01:53:54,557 --> 01:54:00,818
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, he was going around at what was the theater, the Magic Johnson Theater, asking the people if they'd seen Sideways or Million Dollar Baby.

1491
01:54:00,838 --> 01:54:02,639
[SPEAKER_15]: They're like, no.

1492
01:54:02,719 --> 01:54:04,779
[SPEAKER_15]: And he says, what was your favorite movie of the last year?

1493
01:54:04,799 --> 01:54:06,620
[SPEAKER_15]: And some of them are like, Chronicles of Riddick.

1494
01:54:08,580 --> 01:54:10,581
[SPEAKER_15]: Anyway, what are you laughing at there?

1495
01:54:10,661 --> 01:54:11,921
[SPEAKER_15]: Tell the listeners what's up.

1496
01:54:11,961 --> 01:54:17,162
[SPEAKER_11]: The link that DJ Ranma S posted in the chat room of the PlayStation 3.

1497
01:54:18,823 --> 01:54:19,903
[SPEAKER_15]: It's not for real though, is it?

1498
01:54:19,923 --> 01:54:20,343
[SPEAKER_11]: What is it?

1499
01:54:20,443 --> 01:54:21,643
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a fake, but it's funny.

1500
01:54:22,204 --> 01:54:23,584
[SPEAKER_18]: Nobody knows what the PlayStation 3 is.

1501
01:54:24,298 --> 01:54:28,162
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, you know, we just got a new submission for Orange Launch Radio.

1502
01:54:28,262 --> 01:54:31,885
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm having to turn it down because it's not citing a source for more information.

1503
01:54:32,305 --> 01:54:43,175
[SPEAKER_15]: But somebody did send us a new submission that says, coming to us from SummerDog, says, Nintendo will debut the Nintendo Revolution in May at E3.

1504
01:54:43,316 --> 01:54:45,257
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, we'll find out when we're at E3.

1505
01:54:46,338 --> 01:54:46,919
[SPEAKER_15]: That's old news.

1506
01:54:47,319 --> 01:54:52,502
[SPEAKER_15]: All three console makers were going to be debuting their new consoles at E3.

1507
01:54:52,622 --> 01:54:54,724
[SPEAKER_19]: We'll be lucky to get a tech demo on the PS3.

1508
01:54:54,744 --> 01:54:55,885
[SPEAKER_19]: That's not surprising.

1509
01:54:56,205 --> 01:54:57,085
[SPEAKER_19]: I knew that was coming.

1510
01:54:57,346 --> 01:54:58,827
[SPEAKER_19]: We'll be lucky to get a tech demo on the PS3.

1511
01:54:59,007 --> 01:55:10,374
[SPEAKER_13]: And what people don't know is the connectivity with the DS, which will be with the new system, because it will be also wireless, Bluetooth, or whatever it is.

1512
01:55:11,015 --> 01:55:13,296
[SPEAKER_18]: I think Sony will be downplaying the PS3 at E3.

1513
01:55:14,097 --> 01:55:15,818
[SPEAKER_18]: I think they'll be really trying to push the PSP.

1514
01:55:17,165 --> 01:55:19,146
[SPEAKER_18]: and I don't think they have enough of a system together yet.

1515
01:55:21,187 --> 01:55:27,330
[SPEAKER_18]: All they've said is sell processor rocks and it's finished and that we're using an upgraded emotion engine as the I.O.

1516
01:55:27,650 --> 01:55:30,191
[SPEAKER_19]: All I know is we're selling UMD movies now.

1517
01:55:30,251 --> 01:55:31,192
[SPEAKER_19]: We're distributing them.

1518
01:55:33,193 --> 01:55:34,333
[SPEAKER_13]: That's sad.

1519
01:55:34,713 --> 01:55:37,234
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't really want to see that format take off at all.

1520
01:55:37,675 --> 01:55:37,995
[SPEAKER_18]: It won't.

1521
01:55:38,415 --> 01:55:41,456
[SPEAKER_13]: I think it's going to flop just like DVHS.

1522
01:55:41,657 --> 01:55:43,137
[SPEAKER_13]: What's DVHS you may ask?

1523
01:55:43,297 --> 01:55:43,958
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, that's right.

1524
01:55:43,978 --> 01:55:44,738
[SPEAKER_13]: Digital VHS.

1525
01:55:46,827 --> 01:55:56,314
[SPEAKER_15]: We were talking about this briefly on the podcast, which by the way, if you haven't checked out the podcast, check it out, www.orangeloungeradio.com and click on Orange Lounge Radio to go for more information on the podcast.

1526
01:55:56,656 --> 01:55:57,316
[SPEAKER_15]: Check it out, bitches.

1527
01:55:57,336 --> 01:55:59,017
[SPEAKER_15]: You'll see anything that's owned by Sony.

1528
01:55:59,037 --> 01:55:59,517
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, and Spider-Man.

1529
01:55:59,617 --> 01:56:00,597
[SPEAKER_15]: Columbia Pictures, Action Flick.

1530
01:56:26,157 --> 01:56:28,058
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, you're not going to be seeing dramas on the PSP.

1531
01:56:28,119 --> 01:56:30,900
[SPEAKER_15]: Exactly, you wouldn't see foreign films.

1532
01:56:31,260 --> 01:56:33,042
[SPEAKER_15]: You're not going to see that stuff on a PSP.

1533
01:56:33,082 --> 01:56:34,963
[SPEAKER_18]: With a new format, it's not going to happen.

1534
01:56:35,883 --> 01:56:37,825
[SPEAKER_18]: DVD has taken over the market.

1535
01:56:38,265 --> 01:56:40,226
[SPEAKER_18]: It's been the first thing since VHS to do so.

1536
01:56:40,586 --> 01:56:43,828
[SPEAKER_18]: There's always been a superior format to VHS out there.

1537
01:56:45,169 --> 01:56:45,709
[SPEAKER_05]: Like Beta.

1538
01:56:46,390 --> 01:56:48,051
[SPEAKER_18]: Beta, Laserdisc.

1539
01:56:49,296 --> 01:56:50,016
[SPEAKER_18]: All sorts of stuff.

1540
01:56:50,337 --> 01:56:51,638
[SPEAKER_18]: None of it could ever take over the market.

1541
01:56:51,718 --> 01:56:56,844
[SPEAKER_13]: The only thing I could see that possibly happened with this is the price point is pretty good.

1542
01:56:57,004 --> 01:57:02,970
[SPEAKER_13]: It is $19.99 retail for these, which is kind of like that sweet number for movies and stuff.

1543
01:57:03,951 --> 01:57:09,057
[SPEAKER_13]: You could see a new release movie coming out, UMD or whatever, at the same time.

1544
01:57:10,057 --> 01:57:23,968
[SPEAKER_13]: But it's just really, honestly, the format, unless, and this is a big if, unless, like, the new PS3 is going to play UMD and DVD or something like that, you know, I don't really see any people buying stuff just to take it with them on the road.

1545
01:57:24,008 --> 01:57:32,375
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, do you really need to watch, you know, Spider-Man 2 that much?

1546
01:57:32,595 --> 01:57:38,380
[SPEAKER_13]: And the difference, you know, a lot of times people, you know, have DVD players in cars, and I can see this is why they're trying to market this.

1547
01:57:39,000 --> 01:57:45,104
[SPEAKER_13]: But that's because each individual kid has their own screen or there's a central screen there.

1548
01:57:45,144 --> 01:57:50,228
[SPEAKER_13]: Kids are going to try to share a portable game system to watch a movie.

1549
01:57:50,428 --> 01:57:51,349
[SPEAKER_13]: It's not going to happen.

1550
01:57:51,709 --> 01:57:53,971
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, it's just that Sony develops technology.

1551
01:57:54,631 --> 01:57:57,333
[SPEAKER_18]: And they feel compelled to use this technology somehow.

1552
01:57:57,813 --> 01:57:58,574
[SPEAKER_18]: Like Minidisc.

1553
01:57:59,134 --> 01:58:01,676
[SPEAKER_18]: How many years has Sony spent trying to pimp Minidisc?

1554
01:58:02,496 --> 01:58:03,857
[SPEAKER_18]: They're still trying to pimp that shit.

1555
01:58:03,877 --> 01:58:03,998
[SPEAKER_18]: 700 years.

1556
01:58:05,600 --> 01:58:11,082
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, they're still trying to push minidisc as a viable format, and minidisc will never be a viable format.

1557
01:58:11,402 --> 01:58:13,703
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes, it has its uses, sure.

1558
01:58:14,264 --> 01:58:15,524
[SPEAKER_18]: It's a neat little machine.

1559
01:58:16,344 --> 01:58:19,085
[SPEAKER_18]: You know, if the PSP took minidiscs, that would rock.

1560
01:58:19,826 --> 01:58:20,686
[SPEAKER_18]: But it's not happening.

1561
01:58:20,706 --> 01:58:21,807
[SPEAKER_17]: That would have been a smart idea.

1562
01:58:21,827 --> 01:58:21,907
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah.

1563
01:58:23,207 --> 01:58:25,248
[SPEAKER_17]: Because the discs are the same size, am I not correct?

1564
01:58:25,588 --> 01:58:27,429
[SPEAKER_18]: Except for the UMD is rounded.

1565
01:58:28,209 --> 01:58:28,729
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, jeez.

1566
01:58:29,810 --> 01:58:30,050
[SPEAKER_18]: So...

1567
01:58:30,458 --> 01:58:35,359
[SPEAKER_18]: But yeah, it's like, if your PSP could play minidisc audio, that would be sick.

1568
01:58:37,040 --> 01:58:40,341
[SPEAKER_18]: You know, it's the same thing with the UMD movie format.

1569
01:58:40,401 --> 01:58:49,763
[SPEAKER_18]: It's like, Sony developed the technology, and they're a publicly traded company, so it took them, you know, a gajillion years, and stockholders are going like, what the crap are you going to do with this UMD?

1570
01:58:49,803 --> 01:58:52,504
[SPEAKER_18]: And Sony was like, we're going to make a portable game system out of it.

1571
01:58:53,164 --> 01:58:55,085
[SPEAKER_18]: Now they're like, we can play movies with it too.

1572
01:58:55,625 --> 01:58:57,765
[SPEAKER_18]: So they feel compelled to use it.

1573
01:58:59,086 --> 01:58:59,766
[SPEAKER_18]: And that's good.

1574
01:59:00,866 --> 01:59:06,412
[SPEAKER_18]: It'd be nice that it takes off, and I think that it's cool to have a handheld that's going to play discs.

1575
01:59:06,873 --> 01:59:17,484
[SPEAKER_13]: And this proprietary new format will never, ever, ever be able to be pirated to a PC to be played on an emulator, or pirated over the internet.

1576
01:59:17,524 --> 01:59:21,729
[SPEAKER_13]: Because it's proprietary, and they just can't read them.

1577
01:59:22,692 --> 01:59:25,214
[SPEAKER_18]: You know that in like 20 minutes they're going to be on Licksang.

1578
01:59:27,215 --> 01:59:31,418
[SPEAKER_18]: Licksang's going to be like, you can only buy these for purposeful backing up.

1579
01:59:31,718 --> 01:59:32,218
[SPEAKER_18]: Very legal.

1580
01:59:33,039 --> 01:59:33,639
[SPEAKER_18]: Don't pirate.

1581
01:59:34,460 --> 01:59:35,180
[SPEAKER_18]: You'll get a suit.

1582
01:59:38,883 --> 01:59:39,643
[SPEAKER_20]: Hey, man.

1583
01:59:40,484 --> 01:59:40,864
[SPEAKER_15]: All right.

1584
01:59:41,324 --> 01:59:45,187
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, we'll see how the format does when the launch of the PSP is coming up very soon.

1585
01:59:45,307 --> 01:59:46,468
[SPEAKER_15]: Do you remember the launch date?

1586
01:59:46,548 --> 01:59:47,749
[SPEAKER_18]: March 24th.

1587
01:59:47,789 --> 01:59:48,349
[SPEAKER_15]: March 24th.

1588
01:59:48,469 --> 01:59:49,550
[SPEAKER_18]: If you live in the Sacramento area.

1589
01:59:50,014 --> 01:59:53,256
[SPEAKER_18]: GameStop, Marconi and Fulton, come reserve yours now.

1590
01:59:53,376 --> 01:59:59,298
[SPEAKER_18]: If you don't, when you come in to buy one, and I don't have any because I won't, I'm going to laugh my ass off.

1591
02:00:00,839 --> 02:00:02,400
[SPEAKER_15]: I will not be getting a PSP on lunch today.

1592
02:00:02,840 --> 02:00:04,121
[SPEAKER_15]: We'll have our, you can check it out.

1593
02:00:04,281 --> 02:00:05,021
[SPEAKER_15]: Alright, that sounds good.

1594
02:00:05,061 --> 02:00:05,761
[SPEAKER_18]: I traded in a DS.

1595
02:00:06,702 --> 02:00:07,962
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, see, I love my DS.

1596
02:00:07,982 --> 02:00:08,543
[SPEAKER_11]: We had two.

1597
02:00:08,703 --> 02:00:09,523
[SPEAKER_11]: I still have my DS.

1598
02:00:09,543 --> 02:00:10,023
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, that's good.

1599
02:00:10,644 --> 02:00:11,904
[SPEAKER_18]: It's our DS now.

1600
02:00:12,865 --> 02:00:14,125
[SPEAKER_11]: It lives in my laptop now.

1601
02:00:14,345 --> 02:00:15,806
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay, well I guess it's my PSP.

1602
02:00:16,646 --> 02:00:17,127
[SPEAKER_18]: Alright.

1603
02:00:17,167 --> 02:00:17,727
[SPEAKER_18]: God told.

1604
02:00:19,144 --> 02:00:20,765
[SPEAKER_18]: Jamie just popped me the bird.

1605
02:00:21,766 --> 02:00:24,748
[SPEAKER_18]: Can you believe that that kind of behavior would be going on here?

1606
02:00:25,669 --> 02:00:26,150
[SPEAKER_18]: Look at that.

1607
02:00:27,130 --> 02:00:31,214
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, if you think about what it means in slang terms, you know, hey, hot.

1608
02:00:31,674 --> 02:00:32,014
[SPEAKER_15]: All right.

1609
02:00:32,495 --> 02:00:33,195
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.

1610
02:00:33,315 --> 02:00:36,538
[SPEAKER_15]: Let's get to the Orange Lounge Radio cage match, shall we?

1611

02:01:17,321 --> 02:01:27,328
[SPEAKER_15]: And speaking of last week, we actually had a song win for the third time, which means if it wins tonight, it is retired forever.

1621
02:01:27,649 --> 02:01:28,269
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank God.

1622
02:01:28,309 --> 02:01:30,651
[SPEAKER_15]: And it will become only the third song...

1623
02:01:31,232 --> 02:01:32,253
[SPEAKER_15]: Orange Lounge History

1624
02:02:08,613 --> 02:02:10,496
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm on a stakeout I'm on a stakeout

1625
02:02:31,573 --> 02:02:32,534
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for watching!

1626
02:03:00,743 --> 02:03:10,646
[SPEAKER_06]: The feeling is elating, biding my time Yeah, I know that you'll soon be mine Soon to mine Can't let you see me Can't let you see me Can't let you see me

1627
02:03:45,655 --> 02:03:50,558
[SPEAKER_15]: Alright, that was last week's winner for the third time in a row, Freeze Pop with Stakeout.

1628
02:03:50,618 --> 02:03:54,140
[SPEAKER_15]: Let's get into some new songs that are going to challenge that tonight.

1629
02:03:54,160 --> 02:03:56,862
[SPEAKER_15]: And we're going to start it off with Loki's pick.

1630
02:03:57,062 --> 02:03:58,502
[SPEAKER_15]: Loki, what did you pick for us tonight?

1631
02:04:01,044 --> 02:04:01,344
[SPEAKER_13]: Girls.

1632
02:04:01,364 --> 02:04:02,165
[SPEAKER_13]: What the hell?

1633
02:04:03,085 --> 02:04:06,187
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, I picked... No, I did not pick girls.

1634
02:04:06,667 --> 02:04:08,688
[SPEAKER_13]: That joke is old and done with.

1635
02:04:09,689 --> 02:04:09,889
[SPEAKER_13]: I meant...

1636
02:04:10,433 --> 02:04:12,054
[SPEAKER_13]: I missed my opportunity for that joke.

1637
02:04:12,074 --> 02:04:12,775
[SPEAKER_13]: Don't worry, I'll come back.

1638
02:04:13,175 --> 02:04:15,397
[SPEAKER_13]: And so I picked a different song.

1639
02:04:15,477 --> 02:04:20,740
[SPEAKER_13]: I picked another, a different drum label artist.

1640
02:04:21,161 --> 02:04:23,542
[SPEAKER_13]: And this group is called the Dignity of Labor.

1641
02:04:24,303 --> 02:04:29,807
[SPEAKER_13]: And their song, actually the one only song I see that this artist has done, at least it's on a different drum.

1642
02:04:29,827 --> 02:04:33,349
[SPEAKER_13]: It's called XRV, the Never Rock A Mix.

1643
02:04:34,050 --> 02:04:37,072
[SPEAKER_13]: And it's, I don't know what the hell an XRV is.

1644
02:04:37,771 --> 02:04:42,815
[SPEAKER_13]: I didn't listen to the lyrics of the song, but it sounds cool, so this is the song for you.

1645
02:04:45,557 --> 02:04:46,638
[SPEAKER_15]: Alright, from a different drum.

1646
02:04:47,138 --> 02:04:49,740
[SPEAKER_15]: The Dignity of Labor, XRV, The Never Rockin' Me.

1647
02:04:49,961 --> 02:05:00,829
[SPEAKER_13]: And I even edited it down for you guys, because, you know, it was a club-type song, you know, so I edited the end down, so don't listen to all that, you know, drum track and everything.

1648
02:05:01,630 --> 02:05:03,171
[SPEAKER_15]: But it's still a good six minutes long.

1649
02:05:04,692 --> 02:05:05,773
[SPEAKER_21]: It's like five and a half.

1650
02:05:07,034 --> 02:05:08,535
[SPEAKER_15]: My thing says six and a half.

1651
02:05:10,777 --> 02:05:12,258
[SPEAKER_13]: It's not six and a half.

1652
02:05:12,458 --> 02:05:13,099
[SPEAKER_15]: It should not be.

1653
02:05:13,479 --> 02:05:14,620
[SPEAKER_13]: Hold on a second here.

1654
02:05:16,721 --> 02:05:18,402
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, you probably copied it earlier.

1655
02:05:18,523 --> 02:05:19,743
[SPEAKER_13]: Does that say edit on it?

1656
02:05:21,225 --> 02:05:23,426
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, that's because you didn't copy the right one.

1657
02:05:25,247 --> 02:05:26,248
[SPEAKER_13]: I was prepared.

1658
02:05:26,388 --> 02:05:28,910
[SPEAKER_13]: You just tried to screw me over.

1659
02:05:29,411 --> 02:05:29,731
[SPEAKER_13]: Damn it.

1660
02:05:32,276 --> 02:05:38,059
[SPEAKER_13]: I had it all ready to go for you, and I took all the extra time to edit it down for you, and you know what?

1661
02:05:39,660 --> 02:05:40,840
[SPEAKER_13]: This is the thanks I get.

1662
02:05:43,682 --> 02:05:47,844
[SPEAKER_13]: See, the 6.5 version would have been the one with the outro on it.

1663
02:05:48,464 --> 02:05:50,425
[SPEAKER_13]: So I got rid of that, so you don't have to listen to it.

1664
02:05:51,686 --> 02:05:53,647
[SPEAKER_13]: So now we have the one that's good.

1665
02:05:56,988 --> 02:05:58,109
[SPEAKER_15]: Alright, here it is.

1666
02:05:58,269 --> 02:05:59,870
[SPEAKER_15]: Dignity of Labor, XRV.

1667
02:05:59,930 --> 02:06:00,230
[SPEAKER_15]: Enjoy.

1668
02:06:02,645 --> 02:06:03,309
[SPEAKER_06]: YXR, VVVVV

1669
02:06:55,433 --> 02:06:56,844
There is a fallacy

1670
02:09:32,825 --> 02:09:38,969
All I generate, there is no form I cannot penetrate.

1671
02:09:39,290 --> 02:09:44,013
If only you could see the pain I feel in you.

1672
02:09:44,133 --> 02:09:50,918
A mirror to your soul is free, without a trace of vanity.

1673
02:09:51,078 --> 02:09:53,680
I'll share with you the mastery.

1674
02:09:53,700 --> 02:09:56,262
Reveal your agony with exalting you.

1675
02:09:59,884 --> 02:10:01,588
Thanks for watching!

1676
02:11:41,653 --> 02:11:43,754
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, that was song number two in tonight's cage match.

1677
02:11:43,834 --> 02:11:47,376
[SPEAKER_15]: The Dignity of Labor with XRV, the Neveraka mix.

1678
02:11:47,856 --> 02:11:52,439
[SPEAKER_15]: Was that A-OK or was it A-S-S?

1679
02:11:52,979 --> 02:11:53,400
[SPEAKER_15]: Jamie?

1680
02:11:53,920 --> 02:11:58,222
[SPEAKER_11]: There wasn't enough variation in it to really make it... It was very generic sounding, I'm sorry.

1681
02:11:58,282 --> 02:11:58,983
[SPEAKER_11]: It gets so sick.

1682
02:12:01,624 --> 02:12:03,405
[SPEAKER_11]: It was better than Freeze Pop, I'll give it that.

1683
02:12:04,826 --> 02:12:07,367
[SPEAKER_15]: Better than Freeze Pop, that's all you need to know.

1684
02:12:08,688 --> 02:12:10,409
[SPEAKER_15]: Loki, is that all you have to say about it anymore?

1685
02:12:11,283 --> 02:12:12,824
[SPEAKER_15]: It's better than Freeze Pop.

1686
02:12:13,544 --> 02:12:15,505
[SPEAKER_13]: Anything is better than Freeze Pop.

1687
02:12:15,765 --> 02:12:16,306
[SPEAKER_13]: Anything.

1688
02:12:18,227 --> 02:12:18,747
[SPEAKER_13]: Anything.

1689
02:12:18,867 --> 02:12:19,267
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean it.

1690
02:12:19,587 --> 02:12:20,308
[SPEAKER_13]: Give it a score.

1691
02:12:21,869 --> 02:12:23,770
[SPEAKER_13]: It gets a better than Freeze Pop score.

1692
02:12:24,730 --> 02:12:29,353
[SPEAKER_15]: Dan, your opinion on the song, and then you give it something on a scale of 1 to 10.

1693
02:12:29,793 --> 02:12:31,113
[SPEAKER_20]: That song was eternal.

1694
02:12:31,814 --> 02:12:33,335
[SPEAKER_20]: I didn't think it would ever end.

1695
02:12:35,016 --> 02:12:36,856
[SPEAKER_20]: That being said, it didn't suck.

1696
02:12:37,057 --> 02:12:38,277
[SPEAKER_20]: It was just really long.

1697
02:12:38,717 --> 02:12:39,618
[SPEAKER_20]: Talk a little bit about it.

1698
02:12:41,973 --> 02:12:44,694
[SPEAKER_15]: I disagree with Loki, Freeze Pop is better than that song.

1699
02:12:44,994 --> 02:12:49,996
[SPEAKER_15]: Not that that song was bad, it was just very, very, very long and very, very, very dry.

1700
02:12:50,656 --> 02:13:00,300
[SPEAKER_15]: Like, I think I could cut about a minute and a half out of that song and I'd really like it, but as far as the six and a half minute marathon mix, man, whatever, no.

1701
02:13:00,360 --> 02:13:03,681
[SPEAKER_15]: So I give it a six for the number of minutes it almost was.

1702
02:13:04,001 --> 02:13:08,303
[SPEAKER_20]: For dry, long songs, I realize it's awesome.

1703
02:13:08,363 --> 02:13:09,944
[SPEAKER_15]: Jamie, your turn, your pick.

1704
02:13:09,964 --> 02:13:10,804
[SPEAKER_15]: What did you pick for us tonight?

1705
02:13:11,415 --> 02:13:14,376
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, I know it's a remix of Bloodhound Gang.

1706
02:13:14,976 --> 02:13:15,496
[SPEAKER_15]: It sure is.

1707
02:13:16,016 --> 02:13:16,636
[SPEAKER_15]: The Bad Touch.

1708
02:13:16,656 --> 02:13:17,116
[SPEAKER_11]: The Bad Touch.

1709
02:13:17,316 --> 02:13:19,277
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes, but it's by KMFDM.

1710
02:13:19,397 --> 02:13:19,657
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

1711
02:13:19,937 --> 02:13:21,017
[SPEAKER_15]: Which should be interesting.

1712
02:13:23,818 --> 02:13:24,198
[SPEAKER_15]: Alright.

1713
02:13:24,578 --> 02:13:29,939
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I had forgotten that I had it and then I looked on a DVD and was like, oh, I have this, cool.

1714
02:13:31,219 --> 02:13:32,420
[SPEAKER_15]: Alright, so here it is.

1715
02:13:32,440 --> 02:13:33,340
[SPEAKER_15]: Anything else you want to say about it?

1716
02:13:34,360 --> 02:13:34,840
[SPEAKER_15]: Cool.

1717
02:13:35,120 --> 02:13:35,660
[SPEAKER_15]: Let's do it.

1718
02:13:35,880 --> 02:13:38,601
[SPEAKER_15]: Bloodhound Gang, The Bad Touch, KMFDM mix.

1719
02:13:38,681 --> 02:13:38,981
[SPEAKER_15]: Enjoy.

1720
02:13:47,236 --> 02:13:55,411
[SPEAKER_25]: Well now, we call this the act of mating, but there are several other very important differences between human beings and animals that you should know about.

1721
02:14:38,355 --> 02:14:58,243
I want you smothered, want you covered, like my Waffle House Ash Browns, I'm a disc of the FedEx, never reaching a fix, just like a football stock You are a clown to make me rise an hour early, just like daylight's taking time You and me, baby, ain't nothing but mammals, so let's do it like they do on the Discovery Channel You and me, baby, ain't nothing but mammals, so let's do it like they do on the Discovery Channel

1722
02:15:25,794 --> 02:15:34,812
Lost Catacombs of Egypt, only God knows where we stuck it Hieroglyphics, let me be specific, I wanna be down in your southeast But I got this notion that the motion of your ocean

1723
02:15:54,597 --> 02:15:55,481
Thanks for watching!

1724
02:16:26,327 --> 02:16:53,061
[SPEAKER_06]: Nothing but mammals, so let's do it like they do on the Discovery Channel Do it again now You and me, baby, ain't nothing but mammals So let's do it like they do on the Discovery Channel Do it now You and me, baby, ain't nothing but mammals So let's do it like they do on the Discovery Channel Do it again now You and me, baby, ain't nothing but mammals So let's do it like they do on the Discovery Channel

1725
02:17:31,188 --> 02:17:31,794
Thanks for watching!

1726
02:18:02,515 --> 02:18:07,517
[SPEAKER_15]: Alright, that was Bloodhound Gang with Bad Touch, KMFDM Mix, song number 3 tonight.

1727
02:18:07,557 --> 02:18:10,218
[SPEAKER_15]: Let's see what the folks in the studio thought of that one.

1728
02:18:10,278 --> 02:18:10,578
[SPEAKER_15]: Jamie?

1729
02:18:12,319 --> 02:18:18,261
[SPEAKER_11]: I love that song, and I had, you know, set it aside, and then I found the mix, I was like, I love this mix!

1730
02:18:18,921 --> 02:18:23,803
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a great mix of a great song, so it gets a 9.8 infinity.

1731
02:18:23,903 --> 02:18:26,544
[SPEAKER_11]: It's both of our own songs.

1732
02:18:27,409 --> 02:18:33,194
[SPEAKER_11]: Because I get to vote for any damn song I want to as official goddess of this radio station.

1733
02:18:33,254 --> 02:18:36,977
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, also you have to remember though, yeah, you got pwned again.

1734
02:18:37,277 --> 02:18:42,501
[SPEAKER_15]: You have to remember that we actually don't get to vote for the winner.

1735
02:18:42,581 --> 02:18:44,342
[SPEAKER_15]: We just get to give our big fat opinions.

1736
02:18:44,622 --> 02:18:45,663
[SPEAKER_15]: It's like American Idol.

1737
02:18:46,064 --> 02:18:48,726
[SPEAKER_15]: Simon gets to give his opinion, but he doesn't get to pick the winner.

1738
02:18:49,586 --> 02:18:50,167
[SPEAKER_15]: So it's like that.

1739
02:18:50,767 --> 02:18:51,728
[SPEAKER_15]: Loki, your opinion.

1740
02:18:52,929 --> 02:18:54,110
[SPEAKER_13]: Gets a 10 because it's KMFDM.

1741
02:18:54,190 --> 02:18:54,390
[SPEAKER_15]: Fair.

1742
02:18:57,663 --> 02:18:59,124
[SPEAKER_13]: And it's better than Freeze Pop.

1743
02:19:01,746 --> 02:19:05,009
[SPEAKER_15]: I actually like the original song quite a bit, but I'm sorry, Jamie.

1744
02:19:05,089 --> 02:19:07,111
[SPEAKER_15]: I really did not dig that remix at all.

1745
02:19:07,991 --> 02:19:08,832
[SPEAKER_15]: I wasn't feeling it.

1746
02:19:08,912 --> 02:19:09,372
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm sorry.

1747
02:19:09,572 --> 02:19:13,836
[SPEAKER_15]: I like the Eiffel 65 mix of that song a lot, but maybe because it's more Euro.

1748
02:19:13,896 --> 02:19:14,276
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't know.

1749
02:19:14,396 --> 02:19:15,577
[SPEAKER_15]: But I wasn't into that one.

1750
02:19:16,218 --> 02:19:18,099
[SPEAKER_15]: I can only really give that a 6 as well.

1751
02:19:18,319 --> 02:19:18,720
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm sorry.

1752
02:19:19,760 --> 02:19:20,081
[SPEAKER_15]: Dan.

1753
02:19:21,001 --> 02:19:22,803
[SPEAKER_20]: That remix was the mad generic.

1754
02:19:23,583 --> 02:19:24,044
[SPEAKER_20]: It's like...

1755
02:19:24,702 --> 02:19:25,403
[SPEAKER_20]: Words from the song.

1756
02:19:27,384 --> 02:19:28,204
[SPEAKER_18]: Words from the song.

1757
02:19:28,905 --> 02:19:30,546
[SPEAKER_18]: It gets like a four and a half.

1758
02:19:31,006 --> 02:19:35,009
[SPEAKER_18]: That's only because if I score it any lower, Jamie will throw heavier things at me.

1759
02:19:37,210 --> 02:19:40,413
[SPEAKER_18]: Alright, well while Jamie... Oh, three and a half.

1760
02:19:40,553 --> 02:19:50,379
[SPEAKER_15]: While Jamie finds something heavy to throw at Dan, let's recap the three songs you can vote for tonight, starting with Freeze Pops, Stakeout.

1761
02:19:50,479 --> 02:19:51,100
[SPEAKER_06]: One and a half.

1762
02:19:51,380 --> 02:19:52,140
[SPEAKER_06]: Six point nine.

1763
02:19:58,280 --> 02:20:02,141
[SPEAKER_15]: Song number two, The Dignity of Labor with XRV.

1764
02:20:13,704 --> 02:20:19,345
[SPEAKER_15]: And song number three, The Bloodhound Gang with Bad Touch, the Apple 60, I'm sorry, Bad Touch.

1765
02:20:19,585 --> 02:20:21,886
[SPEAKER_11]: And no Euro crap on my song, thank you.

1766
02:20:23,226 --> 02:20:24,347
[SPEAKER_15]: Sorry, wishful thinking there.

1767
02:20:24,607 --> 02:20:25,947
[SPEAKER_15]: The KMFDM Mix.

1768
02:20:37,715 --> 02:20:38,595
[SPEAKER_15]: All right, guys.

1769
02:20:38,756 --> 02:20:41,197
[SPEAKER_15]: Place vote now.

1770
02:20:41,357 --> 02:20:46,141
[SPEAKER_15]: Send a private message to Sky in the chat room with your votes.

1771
02:20:46,341 --> 02:20:48,002
[SPEAKER_15]: Boy, did I fuck that one up, didn't I?

1772
02:20:54,007 --> 02:20:55,448
[SPEAKER_18]: Now your words are a mix.

1773
02:20:57,069 --> 02:20:57,389
[SPEAKER_15]: All right.

1774
02:20:57,950 --> 02:21:00,952
[SPEAKER_15]: Loki, what's going on in the sim scene lately?

1775
02:21:04,102 --> 02:21:07,869
[SPEAKER_21]: Have we heard any more news about the election that was last year?

1776
02:21:11,816 --> 02:21:13,319
[SPEAKER_15]: What in the hell are you talking about?

1777
02:21:14,090 --> 02:21:17,351
[SPEAKER_13]: Just say no, because there's nothing going on in the sim scene!

1778
02:21:17,771 --> 02:21:19,531
[SPEAKER_13]: Nothing, zero, nada!

1779
02:21:20,531 --> 02:21:26,272
[SPEAKER_13]: There's more going on in my bathroom right now than there is in the goddamn sim scene.

1780
02:21:26,612 --> 02:21:27,572
[SPEAKER_05]: Zilch.

1781
02:21:27,632 --> 02:21:28,112
[SPEAKER_13]: Nothing.

1782
02:21:28,533 --> 02:21:31,053
[SPEAKER_13]: To be honest, there's more sim files out there.

1783
02:21:31,093 --> 02:21:31,593
[SPEAKER_13]: Guess what?

1784
02:21:31,613 --> 02:21:32,793
[SPEAKER_13]: They still suck.

1785
02:21:33,833 --> 02:21:40,895
[SPEAKER_13]: There's more really crappy songs that people make that still really suck, and there's more Max remixes out there that still really suck.

1786
02:21:41,615 --> 02:21:42,275
[SPEAKER_13]: To be honest...

1787
02:21:43,773 --> 02:21:44,715
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you for watching!

1788
02:22:02,421 --> 02:22:18,859
[SPEAKER_13]: Really, you know, get into another game, maybe, you know, discover girls, I don't know, just something else, but really, there's nothing going on at all in the sim scene, nothing nada, except for one little thing, and that's just that this is...

1789
02:22:20,760 --> 02:22:22,361
[SPEAKER_13]: Loki, doing his part to promote the hobby.

1790
02:22:22,381 --> 02:22:24,922
[SPEAKER_13]: This is a DDRXXMix official website.

1791
02:22:25,262 --> 02:22:29,104
[SPEAKER_13]: They're doing version 2.0 right now, and they have this funny little thing on there.

1792
02:22:29,224 --> 02:22:32,165
[SPEAKER_13]: I just have to read it because it's just, you know, funny.

1793
02:22:32,845 --> 02:22:36,026
[SPEAKER_13]: And it is this little English thing.

1794
02:22:36,086 --> 02:22:39,808
[SPEAKER_13]: It says, how we stand as dancer to dance.

1795
02:22:40,208 --> 02:22:44,290
[SPEAKER_15]: So I just thought that was funny, and that's all that I have to contribute as far as that.

1796
02:22:47,131 --> 02:22:49,232
[SPEAKER_15]: How can we stand as dancer to dance?

1797
02:22:50,256 --> 02:22:50,677
[SPEAKER_15]: DDRUK is gone.

1798
02:23:11,327 --> 02:23:13,869
[SPEAKER_13]: DDR Maniacs is never coming back as far as I'm concerned.

1799
02:23:13,909 --> 02:23:16,631
[SPEAKER_13]: It's been gone for months, so really, does anyone miss it?

1800
02:23:16,711 --> 02:23:17,432
[SPEAKER_13]: No.

1801
02:23:18,893 --> 02:23:19,894
[SPEAKER_13]: It's just, it's gone.

1802
02:23:21,475 --> 02:23:25,678
[SPEAKER_13]: DDR UK, I'm sure they're going to come back someday, but it's going to be too late anyways.

1803
02:23:25,758 --> 02:23:29,220
[SPEAKER_13]: It's just like the melting pot, remember that old-ass site that used to be around?

1804
02:23:30,101 --> 02:23:30,521
[SPEAKER_13]: It's gone.

1805
02:23:33,513 --> 02:23:36,355
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm afraid to say it, but yeah, there's nothing going on in the sim scene.

1806
02:23:36,375 --> 02:23:37,396
[SPEAKER_13]: The sim scene's dying.

1807
02:23:37,756 --> 02:23:38,196
[SPEAKER_13]: It's gone.

1808
02:23:39,817 --> 02:23:40,958
[SPEAKER_15]: It's really, there's not much left.

1809
02:23:41,198 --> 02:23:42,259
[SPEAKER_15]: So, that's it.

1810
02:23:44,340 --> 02:23:44,760
[SPEAKER_15]: Now, wait a minute.

1811
02:23:44,800 --> 02:23:48,142
[SPEAKER_15]: I played a cool thing that one of our listeners did.

1812
02:23:48,182 --> 02:23:53,385
[SPEAKER_15]: He did a Simphile to the Gem theme song by FreezePop, and it was pretty rad, I gotta say.

1813
02:23:53,485 --> 02:23:54,186
[SPEAKER_15]: Check it out, guys.

1814
02:23:54,846 --> 02:23:55,467
[SPEAKER_15]: It's pretty rad.

1815
02:23:56,147 --> 02:23:56,928
[SPEAKER_15]: It is outrageous.

1816
02:23:57,468 --> 02:23:59,849
[SPEAKER_15]: Truly, truly, truly outrageous.

1817
02:24:01,050 --> 02:24:02,591
[SPEAKER_18]: Dude, the Misfits songs are better.

1818
02:24:04,696 --> 02:24:06,297
[SPEAKER_17]: I want, you know what I want?

1819
02:24:06,538 --> 02:24:33,039
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh my god, oh my god, sim people, oh my god, sim people, sim people Oh my god, oh my god, do this Get all of Jem's songs and make like an all Jem DDR mix And you can have some Misfits songs too because they were cool too But like, I want to make like this whole mix of DDR just out of songs that were featured in Jem Tell me that would not rock That would not rock You're a liar!

1820
02:24:34,164 --> 02:24:34,965
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes, I am.

1821
02:24:37,267 --> 02:24:37,848
[SPEAKER_15]: Come on, Loki.

1822
02:24:38,108 --> 02:24:39,990
[SPEAKER_15]: They can open up DDRUK back up for this.

1823
02:24:41,632 --> 02:24:49,220
[SPEAKER_21]: I was just going to give you an example here of why there's nothing available right now.

1824
02:24:49,400 --> 02:24:50,762
[SPEAKER_21]: And I really got to find the song.

1825
02:24:50,822 --> 02:24:55,827
[SPEAKER_21]: I downloaded it earlier, and I know I'm probably not going to find it because there's just too much shit out there right now.

1826
02:24:57,785 --> 02:24:58,445
[SPEAKER_21]: Here we go.

1827
02:24:59,246 --> 02:25:08,788
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, this is a perfect example of why you do not need... I mean, just sim files nowadays, they're just really bad.

1828
02:25:09,129 --> 02:25:18,211
[SPEAKER_13]: And I cannot stress how bad they are, but I think I can come close with this song right here.

1829
02:25:18,651 --> 02:25:23,413
[SPEAKER_13]: Now, granted, it's not as colorful as Mac's vagina, but you know what?

1830
02:25:23,693 --> 02:25:23,873
[SPEAKER_13]: It's...

1831
02:25:24,864 --> 02:25:25,645
[SPEAKER_13]: Pretty bad.

1832
02:25:25,925 --> 02:25:27,366
[SPEAKER_13]: And this is a sim file.

1833
02:25:27,967 --> 02:25:41,518
[SPEAKER_13]: You can go out there and you can definitely thank Thunderbird, that's B-Y-R-D, 24 on BomaniStyle.com for this wonderful piece of crap.

1834
02:25:41,958 --> 02:25:47,342
[SPEAKER_21]: This is six subs, seven grams of fat.

1835
02:25:48,463 --> 02:25:50,165
[SPEAKER_21]: Or seven subs of six grams of fat.

1836
02:25:51,366 --> 02:25:51,606
[SPEAKER_21]: Enjoy.

1837
02:26:10,069 --> 02:26:10,250
Hey!

1838
02:26:10,511 --> 02:26:12,659
This is the week with you!

1839
02:26:42,222 --> 02:26:44,583
[SPEAKER_15]: You make this song stop and you make it stop now.

1840
02:26:45,224 --> 02:26:47,065
[SPEAKER_05]: Ow, my eardrums.

1841
02:26:48,526 --> 02:26:49,727
[SPEAKER_15]: How do I unplug your computer?

1842
02:26:49,767 --> 02:26:54,229
[SPEAKER_06]: How do I do it?

1843
02:26:55,970 --> 02:26:57,971
[SPEAKER_15]: Please, turn it off.

1844
02:26:59,132 --> 02:27:00,113
[SPEAKER_15]: Jesus, yes I can.

1845
02:27:00,353 --> 02:27:01,654
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh dear God.

1846
02:27:01,894 --> 02:27:06,436
[SPEAKER_13]: See, that right there is why this stuff sucks.

1847
02:27:06,857 --> 02:27:09,538
[SPEAKER_13]: Really, do we need this crap?

1848
02:27:10,239 --> 02:27:10,619
[SPEAKER_13]: Honestly.

1849
02:27:13,416 --> 02:27:14,597
[SPEAKER_21]: This is why the sim scene is dying.

1850
02:27:14,717 --> 02:27:15,438
[SPEAKER_21]: It's because of this crap.

1851
02:27:16,859 --> 02:27:17,159
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm done.

1852
02:27:20,261 --> 02:27:20,681
[SPEAKER_15]: Alright.

1853
02:27:25,404 --> 02:27:32,048
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, I just made a last call for cage match votes, and it's been about 30 seconds, so I think that's enough time.

1854
02:27:32,088 --> 02:27:33,869
[SPEAKER_15]: Do you guys want to know who won tonight's cage match?

1855
02:27:35,390 --> 02:27:35,791
[SPEAKER_15]: Sure.

1856
02:27:36,451 --> 02:27:37,131
[SPEAKER_15]: Do we ever.

1857
02:27:37,392 --> 02:27:39,433
[SPEAKER_15]: This is a very interesting situation.

1858
02:27:42,508 --> 02:27:45,110
[SPEAKER_15]: One vote yet again decides the cage match.

1859
02:27:46,591 --> 02:27:50,414
[SPEAKER_15]: And it decides the cage match to be a tie once again.

1860
02:27:50,914 --> 02:27:52,015
[SPEAKER_15]: Tie cage match.

1861
02:27:52,856 --> 02:27:54,877
[SPEAKER_15]: Song number one tied tonight.

1862
02:28:00,221 --> 02:28:03,443
[SPEAKER_15]: Dignity of Labor, XRV.

1863
02:28:04,544 --> 02:28:07,246
[SPEAKER_15]: And song number two tied tonight.

1864
02:28:08,991 --> 02:28:09,871
[SPEAKER_15]: Freeze Pop.

1865
02:28:13,112 --> 02:28:22,376
[SPEAKER_15]: And let's go to the rule book that shows that, oh yes, if in case of a tie, the host whose song did not get picked gets to break the tie.

1866
02:28:22,436 --> 02:28:30,679
[SPEAKER_15]: So Jamie, is she going to retire Freeze Pop or is she going to deny Freeze Pop that right and pick the other song?

1867
02:28:30,739 --> 02:28:31,779
[SPEAKER_15]: Freeze Pop's going down.

1868
02:28:32,079 --> 02:28:35,780
[SPEAKER_11]: On one hand, I could torture all of our listeners with more Freeze Pop.

1869
02:28:35,800 --> 02:28:36,681
[SPEAKER_11]: You did that last time.

1870
02:28:36,881 --> 02:28:37,661
[SPEAKER_11]: I did that last time.

1871
02:28:40,586 --> 02:28:41,706
[SPEAKER_11]: Rob, Rob.

1872
02:28:41,987 --> 02:28:42,207
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

1873
02:28:42,727 --> 02:28:43,527
[SPEAKER_05]: Rob.

1874
02:28:43,567 --> 02:28:43,767
[SPEAKER_05]: What?

1875
02:28:44,848 --> 02:28:45,408
[SPEAKER_06]: Loser!

1876
02:28:46,488 --> 02:28:47,228
[SPEAKER_06]: Ha ha!

1877
02:28:47,609 --> 02:28:48,769
[SPEAKER_15]: Loser!

1878
02:28:49,789 --> 02:28:51,290
[SPEAKER_15]: That's alright, that's alright.

1879
02:28:51,510 --> 02:28:54,111
[SPEAKER_10]: Rob.

1880
02:28:54,331 --> 02:28:54,691
[SPEAKER_15]: What?

1881
02:28:54,711 --> 02:28:54,791
[SPEAKER_15]: What?

1882
02:28:57,612 --> 02:29:00,413
[SPEAKER_15]: Alright, so new winner tonight, thanks to Jamie.

1883
02:29:00,793 --> 02:29:04,615
[SPEAKER_15]: Jamie denies Freeze Pop the entrance to retire.

1884
02:29:05,835 --> 02:29:06,875
[SPEAKER_15]: XRV wins.

1885
02:29:06,935 --> 02:29:08,176
[SPEAKER_15]: But in reality, kids...

1886
02:29:08,834 --> 02:29:11,556
[SPEAKER_15]: If you don't agree with that, maybe you should have gotten your friend to vote.

1887
02:29:11,757 --> 02:29:15,480
[SPEAKER_15]: Because only one vote made the difference there.

1888
02:29:17,021 --> 02:29:17,382
[SPEAKER_15]: Alright.

1889
02:29:19,483 --> 02:29:22,426
[SPEAKER_15]: So next week you all get Britney Spears remix, courtesy of me.

1890
02:29:22,546 --> 02:29:23,947
[SPEAKER_15]: So enjoy that next week.

1891
02:29:24,668 --> 02:29:25,229
[SPEAKER_16]: Awesome.

1892
02:29:25,249 --> 02:29:28,311
[SPEAKER_15]: We're going to have an awesome cage match next week.

1893
02:29:29,192 --> 02:29:31,014
[SPEAKER_16]: Loki's going to play that song we just heard.

1894
02:29:34,673 --> 02:29:37,174
[SPEAKER_15]: All right, yes, we definitely need the FUs after that one.

1895
02:29:37,515 --> 02:29:40,076
[SPEAKER_15]: So we're going to go to break, and then when we come back, the FUs of the week.

1896
02:29:40,536 --> 02:29:43,878
[SPEAKER_15]: So send us your FUs over private message, and we'll get to them.

1897
02:29:44,038 --> 02:29:46,139
[SPEAKER_15]: In this break, you get a potpourri.

1898
02:29:46,439 --> 02:29:48,060
[SPEAKER_15]: You get potpourri de mamani.

1899
02:29:50,241 --> 02:29:51,362
[SPEAKER_15]: Potpourri de mamani.

1900
02:29:51,382 --> 02:29:52,423
[SPEAKER_15]: Potpourri, rock.

1901
02:29:52,463 --> 02:29:53,083
[SPEAKER_15]: Potpourri.

1902
02:29:53,903 --> 02:29:57,165
[SPEAKER_15]: Starting it off with Setsugeka from TenStyle.

1903
02:29:58,586 --> 02:29:59,086
[SPEAKER_15]: We'll be back.

1904
02:29:59,547 --> 02:30:00,267
[SPEAKER_15]: More Orange Launch Radio.

1905
02:32:20,154 --> 02:32:20,815
Thanks for watching!

1906
02:32:43,257 --> 02:32:44,218
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you for watching!

1907
02:34:48,325 --> 02:34:48,810
Thank you.

1908
02:36:23,971 --> 02:36:28,055
[SPEAKER_06]: Hello everybody, welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio.

1909
02:36:28,155 --> 02:36:35,621
[SPEAKER_06]: We are going to get into the FUs of the week fairly shortly here.

1910
02:36:44,918 --> 02:36:47,381
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you guys for being loyal and sticking with us.

1911
02:37:03,795 --> 02:37:04,855
[SPEAKER_15]: I know, I don't care this year.

1912
02:37:05,336 --> 02:37:18,880
[SPEAKER_15]: The only ones I saw, I saw Finding Neverland, which I really, really liked, but for some reason people wanted to stay far away from that movie, but it was really good, I guess because supposedly the guy was an accused child molester or something, but it was a good movie, whatever, let it just be a movie.

1913
02:37:19,900 --> 02:37:21,501
[SPEAKER_15]: And I saw Sideways, which was also funny.

1914
02:37:22,495 --> 02:37:22,976
[SPEAKER_21]: And they suck.

1915
02:37:22,996 --> 02:37:23,296
[SPEAKER_21]: Who cares?

1916
02:37:40,143 --> 02:37:47,686
[SPEAKER_15]: And actually, I would say the best motion picture of the year would be Paris Hilton's sex tape, actually, would be the Oscar winner for this year.

1917
02:37:48,667 --> 02:37:51,828
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't know if you saw it, but it was a fine performance by Miss Hilton.

1918
02:37:51,848 --> 02:37:52,368
[SPEAKER_06]: Negative.

1919
02:37:53,529 --> 02:37:54,149
[SPEAKER_06]: Negative.

1920
02:37:54,849 --> 02:38:01,532
[SPEAKER_15]: When she just stops in the middle of what she's doing to pick up that cell phone, I was moved.

1921
02:38:02,452 --> 02:38:03,853
[SPEAKER_18]: There was no dramatic focus.

1922
02:38:04,395 --> 02:38:12,298
[SPEAKER_13]: Personally, I thought that the art direction in Cameron Diaz, the bondage video that she did, was much better.

1923
02:38:12,698 --> 02:38:13,158
[SPEAKER_20]: Say what?

1924
02:38:14,119 --> 02:38:17,240
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, there's a Cameron Diaz bondage video.

1925
02:38:17,300 --> 02:38:18,760
[SPEAKER_13]: It's fucking hot!

1926
02:38:20,381 --> 02:38:20,641
[SPEAKER_13]: Anyways.

1927
02:38:20,661 --> 02:38:24,202
[SPEAKER_18]: We have to use Jamie's computer to look up some porn.

1928
02:38:27,224 --> 02:38:29,104
[SPEAKER_18]: Now we know where that spyware is coming from.

1929
02:38:29,484 --> 02:38:29,765
[SPEAKER_15]: We did...

1930
02:38:31,750 --> 02:38:44,275
[SPEAKER_15]: We did watch, I don't know, like 10 minutes of the Oscars while it was sitting here on the TV, and we were waiting for the show to start, and Drew Barrymore came out, and what did Loki say something about, I saw a movie with her in it where she was naked and had blood on her boobs.

1931
02:38:44,395 --> 02:38:44,856
[SPEAKER_15]: What was that?

1932
02:38:45,276 --> 02:38:46,476
[SPEAKER_15]: What was that you were talking about?

1933
02:38:47,317 --> 02:38:57,681
[SPEAKER_21]: She was in this really shitty horror movie, and I don't remember the name of it, but there was a shower scene where blood was coming out of the shower heads, and it was going over her breasts, so she was being...

1934
02:38:58,510 --> 02:39:03,132
[SPEAKER_13]: It was her, naked, with her boobies, and her boobies were being covered by fake blood.

1935
02:39:04,852 --> 02:39:05,193
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh yeah.

1936
02:39:06,373 --> 02:39:08,794
[SPEAKER_18]: And the funny thing about Drew Barrymore was she was like 10 at the time.

1937
02:39:09,614 --> 02:39:17,697
[SPEAKER_18]: And she was already cracked out and had to take these really bad movies to keep her career alive.

1938
02:39:19,918 --> 02:39:20,318
[SPEAKER_15]: Wow.

1939
02:39:22,239 --> 02:39:24,340
[SPEAKER_15]: Let's move on to the FUs of the week, shall we?

1940
02:39:25,120 --> 02:39:27,841
[SPEAKER_15]: Jamie, why is it we do these FUs of the week every single week?

1941
02:39:30,919 --> 02:39:34,262
[SPEAKER_20]: Because Danny hates humanity.

1942
02:39:34,282 --> 02:39:36,964
[SPEAKER_20]: That includes all of you.

1943
02:39:37,064 --> 02:39:38,946
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, all of this is bad.

1944
02:39:38,966 --> 02:39:41,028
[SPEAKER_06]: But here is justice.

1945
02:39:41,068 --> 02:39:42,429
[SPEAKER_06]: Here is punishment.

1946
02:39:42,449 --> 02:39:45,251
[SPEAKER_06]: Here is... This is fucked up!

1947
02:39:46,052 --> 02:39:47,453
[SPEAKER_11]: They expect you to dust.

1948
02:39:48,654 --> 02:39:51,977
[SPEAKER_11]: And the two years of it we... worth of it that we stirred up.

1949
02:39:51,997 --> 02:39:53,058
[SPEAKER_12]: Five years.

1950
02:39:53,078 --> 02:39:54,880
[SPEAKER_11]: You didn't live in that damn apartment for five years.

1951
02:39:54,900 --> 02:39:55,540
[SPEAKER_12]: Four years.

1952
02:39:57,242 --> 02:39:58,223
[SPEAKER_12]: Lots of years.

1953
02:39:59,600 --> 02:40:00,801
[SPEAKER_11]: Shut up, my F.U.

1954
02:40:02,702 --> 02:40:03,262
[SPEAKER_11]: Big F.U.

1955
02:40:03,302 --> 02:40:04,123
[SPEAKER_11]: to my allergies.

1956
02:40:04,723 --> 02:40:04,944
[SPEAKER_11]: F.U.

1957
02:40:04,964 --> 02:40:07,785
[SPEAKER_11]: to stupid people who speed past me in the rain.

1958
02:40:09,807 --> 02:40:09,947
[SPEAKER_11]: F.U.

1959
02:40:09,987 --> 02:40:11,488
[SPEAKER_11]: to Dan for interrupting me.

1960
02:40:12,048 --> 02:40:13,489
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah.

1961
02:40:14,350 --> 02:40:16,291
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm surprised that actually you guys don't get an F.U.

1962
02:40:16,311 --> 02:40:17,672
[SPEAKER_18]: to Dan every week.

1963
02:40:18,612 --> 02:40:21,814
[SPEAKER_18]: In fact, I think that by now it should just be a feature.

1964
02:40:22,195 --> 02:40:23,215
[SPEAKER_18]: So, Jamie, F.U.

1965
02:40:23,255 --> 02:40:23,976
[SPEAKER_18]: to Dan, right?

1966
02:40:24,436 --> 02:40:25,477
[SPEAKER_18]: Fucking duh.

1967
02:40:26,537 --> 02:40:26,818
[SPEAKER_11]: Dan.

1968
02:40:28,419 --> 02:40:28,959
[SPEAKER_11]: Shut up, please.

1969
02:40:29,927 --> 02:40:32,269
[SPEAKER_11]: Or I'll throw the ferret at you.

1970
02:40:34,270 --> 02:40:34,991
[SPEAKER_18]: Throw the ferret?

1971
02:40:35,031 --> 02:40:36,252
[SPEAKER_18]: Does that mean what I think it means?

1972
02:40:37,492 --> 02:40:37,993
[SPEAKER_18]: It doesn't.

1973
02:40:41,976 --> 02:40:44,157
[SPEAKER_11]: And F you to being sick for a week.

1974
02:40:46,098 --> 02:40:46,899
[SPEAKER_11]: Ow, you bitch!

1975
02:40:47,940 --> 02:40:48,860
[SPEAKER_20]: I threw the ferret back.

1976
02:40:50,662 --> 02:40:53,904
[SPEAKER_11]: The voice thing landed on my collarbone.

1977
02:40:53,924 --> 02:40:55,285
[SPEAKER_11]: F you to pain.

1978
02:40:56,306 --> 02:40:57,186
[SPEAKER_20]: Collarbone nothing.

1979
02:40:57,566 --> 02:40:58,307
[SPEAKER_20]: I hit her in the rack.

1980
02:40:58,769 --> 02:40:59,329
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm a good throw.

1981
02:40:59,349 --> 02:41:00,930
[SPEAKER_11]: You hit me on my damn collarbone.

1982
02:41:01,230 --> 02:41:02,651
[SPEAKER_20]: Shut up, this is radio, they don't know.

1983
02:41:06,332 --> 02:41:07,633
[SPEAKER_11]: You hit my laptop, you die.

1984
02:41:07,653 --> 02:41:12,635
[SPEAKER_11]: Aha, deflected.

1985
02:41:12,715 --> 02:41:15,937
[SPEAKER_11]: She wears such a bad aim.

1986
02:41:17,317 --> 02:41:17,897
[SPEAKER_15]: Uh, FUs?

1987
02:41:18,358 --> 02:41:18,738
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh yeah.

1988
02:41:19,418 --> 02:41:22,980
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, FU to being distracted by the ferret being thrown by Dan.

1989
02:41:25,201 --> 02:41:26,901
[SPEAKER_11]: FU to my laundry not being dry yet.

1990
02:41:27,802 --> 02:41:28,222
[SPEAKER_11]: And, uh,

1991
02:41:29,475 --> 02:41:32,904
[SPEAKER_11]: SU to Chipotle for having really good rice that I can't eat.

1992
02:41:33,826 --> 02:41:34,307
[SPEAKER_11]: Loki.

1993
02:41:36,533 --> 02:41:36,854
[SPEAKER_15]: Loki.

1994
02:41:42,397 --> 02:41:46,619
[SPEAKER_13]: First off, fuck you the Oscars, because they still suck.

1995
02:41:46,819 --> 02:41:50,480
[SPEAKER_21]: Even if you do get Chris Rock to host it, that does not make them any better.

1996
02:41:50,580 --> 02:41:51,660
[SPEAKER_21]: They just still suck.

1997
02:41:51,960 --> 02:41:53,981
[SPEAKER_21]: And I feel sorry for Chris Rock for having to do that.

1998
02:41:54,481 --> 02:42:00,543
[SPEAKER_13]: I know he's hard up on money, and the need to take that job, but my god.

1999
02:42:01,003 --> 02:42:02,084
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, what's going to be next?

2000
02:42:02,164 --> 02:42:04,185
[SPEAKER_13]: Dave Chappelle hosting the Oscars?

2001
02:42:04,925 --> 02:42:08,466
[SPEAKER_13]: That might get me to watch it, but I don't think it's going to happen.

2002
02:42:09,096 --> 02:42:28,286
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, fuck you to my computer for, first off, you know, the power supply being all fucked up, and then I had to get a new one, and then the stupid little fan that was, you know, cooling my graphics, uh, proc card there, uh, well, it's too noisy, so I had to pull it out of there as well, and come to find out it wasn't doing shit.

2003
02:42:28,586 --> 02:42:29,086
[SPEAKER_13]: Actually, the...

2004
02:42:29,426 --> 02:42:32,708
[SPEAKER_13]: Fan was not even over the heat sink, so it was doing nothing.

2005
02:42:33,149 --> 02:42:34,129
[SPEAKER_13]: So that kind of was lame.

2006
02:42:34,630 --> 02:42:40,794
[SPEAKER_13]: And then, um, fuck you to Final Fantasy because it's been all laggy and weird lately.

2007
02:42:41,454 --> 02:42:42,215
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know why.

2008
02:42:42,275 --> 02:42:46,478
[SPEAKER_13]: It's like you'd think that they hosted the servers in the United States or something.

2009
02:42:46,618 --> 02:42:48,599
[SPEAKER_13]: Because, I mean, they're really shitty.

2010
02:42:49,260 --> 02:42:55,824
[SPEAKER_13]: And then, uh, fuck you to Golf Land because, once again, you just do not maintain your stuff there.

2011
02:42:55,924 --> 02:42:56,825
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, my god.

2012
02:42:57,885 --> 02:42:58,506
[SPEAKER_13]: I can't believe...

2013
02:42:59,279 --> 02:43:02,982
[SPEAKER_13]: You would think that they were Microsoft or something with all the shit that was broken there.

2014
02:43:04,563 --> 02:43:05,364
[SPEAKER_13]: I just don't get it.

2015
02:43:06,565 --> 02:43:11,689
[SPEAKER_13]: And, um... Finally, um... Fuck these Macs because they suck.

2016
02:43:11,749 --> 02:43:18,314
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, I'm done.

2017
02:43:21,276 --> 02:43:22,517
[SPEAKER_15]: F you to Final Fantasy XI.

2018
02:43:23,318 --> 02:43:25,640
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm really getting sick of your bullshit, you little game.

2019
02:43:26,561 --> 02:43:28,282
[SPEAKER_15]: Link, come over here so I can kick your ass.

2020
02:43:30,789 --> 02:43:35,072
[SPEAKER_15]: and F you to me sleeping 12 hours yesterday and 10 hours today.

2021
02:43:35,092 --> 02:43:35,893
[SPEAKER_15]: That's a lot of sleep.

2022
02:43:37,154 --> 02:43:42,218
[SPEAKER_15]: And F you to some drama that was going on last week.

2023
02:43:42,958 --> 02:43:47,422
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh my god, F you to big projects that fall in my lap at the last freaking minute.

2024
02:43:47,542 --> 02:43:48,363
[SPEAKER_15]: I hate that stuff.

2025
02:43:48,423 --> 02:43:48,923
[SPEAKER_15]: I hate it!

2026
02:43:49,744 --> 02:43:51,385
[SPEAKER_15]: You guys have more advance notice of this.

2027
02:43:51,445 --> 02:43:54,187
[SPEAKER_15]: Quit giving it to me at the last minute and then making me, like, die.

2028
02:43:54,327 --> 02:43:54,808
[SPEAKER_15]: I hate that.

2029
02:43:55,128 --> 02:43:57,470
[SPEAKER_19]: I hate you neither.

2030
02:44:05,500 --> 02:44:06,120
[SPEAKER_15]: I have not.

2031
02:44:06,321 --> 02:44:08,222
[SPEAKER_15]: I can't say I have.

2032
02:44:08,502 --> 02:44:15,608
[SPEAKER_15]: And then F you to people bitching about the Oscars because, you know, I have to do this show.

2033
02:44:16,029 --> 02:44:23,575
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't get to go to the big gay Oscar party and sit around and be catty and talk about how ugly everybody looks in their dress with people.

2034
02:44:24,035 --> 02:44:25,316
[SPEAKER_11]: The big gay party.

2035
02:44:25,917 --> 02:44:26,157
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

2036
02:44:27,524 --> 02:44:30,846
[SPEAKER_15]: If I wasn't doing this show, I would be at a big gay Oscar party right now.

2037
02:44:31,086 --> 02:44:31,627
[SPEAKER_15]: I know I would.

2038
02:44:32,447 --> 02:44:35,309
[SPEAKER_15]: Because the Oscars are the Super Bowls for gays.

2039
02:44:35,469 --> 02:44:35,770
[SPEAKER_15]: It is.

2040
02:44:37,130 --> 02:44:42,594
[SPEAKER_21]: If I wasn't doing this show, I'd be at an Oscar party too because we're having a free one at work and I get free booze and food.

2041
02:44:43,495 --> 02:44:45,597
[SPEAKER_21]: That's the only reason I'd go though, is for the free booze and food.

2042
02:44:45,857 --> 02:44:47,258
[SPEAKER_21]: I wouldn't go because of the Oscars.

2043
02:44:47,298 --> 02:44:48,038
[SPEAKER_21]: Fuck the Oscars.

2044
02:44:48,599 --> 02:44:48,879
[SPEAKER_21]: I'd just

2045
02:44:49,201 --> 02:44:51,863
[SPEAKER_21]: I do what I do for all of our company parties.

2046
02:44:51,963 --> 02:44:54,144
[SPEAKER_15]: I go get food, get full, and leave.

2047
02:44:54,825 --> 02:44:57,506
[SPEAKER_15]: And say, fuck them, I ain't waiting for the end of year party.

2048
02:44:58,307 --> 02:44:58,747
[SPEAKER_15]: Totally.

2049
02:44:58,827 --> 02:45:00,608
[SPEAKER_15]: Free food would have rocked.

2050
02:45:01,169 --> 02:45:03,770
[SPEAKER_15]: I could go for, like, some cocktail weenies right now.

2051
02:45:04,090 --> 02:45:05,251
[SPEAKER_15]: Don't make the gay joke.

2052
02:45:05,431 --> 02:45:05,832
[SPEAKER_15]: Stop.

2053
02:45:06,092 --> 02:45:06,572
[SPEAKER_15]: Stop it.

2054
02:45:06,832 --> 02:45:10,134
[SPEAKER_11]: We did that for the Seinfeld last episode.

2055
02:45:10,474 --> 02:45:12,256
[SPEAKER_11]: We totally crushed the Seinfeld party.

2056
02:45:12,396 --> 02:45:13,436
[SPEAKER_11]: Ate their food and left.

2057
02:45:15,658 --> 02:45:16,918
[SPEAKER_15]: Were there cocktail weenies there?

2058
02:45:16,938 --> 02:45:17,699
[SPEAKER_11]: No, they had cake.

2059
02:45:18,717 --> 02:45:19,437
[SPEAKER_15]: Cake is good.

2060
02:45:20,418 --> 02:45:23,480
[SPEAKER_15]: See, I could be eating Oscar cake right now, but I'm doing this show.

2061
02:45:26,722 --> 02:45:27,323
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm spent.

2062
02:45:28,243 --> 02:45:30,525
[SPEAKER_15]: Jamie, you have one you wanted to add, okay?

2063
02:45:30,545 --> 02:45:34,587
[SPEAKER_11]: F you to Squenix for pushing back the date for the Final Fantasy XI Atlas.

2064
02:45:35,268 --> 02:45:35,588
[SPEAKER_11]: That's it.

2065
02:45:36,929 --> 02:45:38,069
[SPEAKER_17]: Are they writing it themselves?

2066
02:45:38,470 --> 02:45:43,733
[SPEAKER_17]: I think you gotta blame Brady Games for that one.

2067
02:45:43,953 --> 02:45:44,874
[SPEAKER_11]: Brady Games took it anyway.

2068
02:45:45,974 --> 02:45:47,775
[SPEAKER_15]: Dan, did you have any FUs of the week you wanted to give?

2069
02:45:48,115 --> 02:46:05,471
[SPEAKER_18]: I'd like to level a giant FU at Ultracade who think that they're super clever trying to trademark the name MAME and the logo for MAME because he wants, you know, to have, I guess, a hold on the emulation market.

2070
02:46:06,852 --> 02:46:10,435
[SPEAKER_18]: The guy's name is David R. Foley and he's an asshole.

2071
02:46:11,317 --> 02:46:14,079
[SPEAKER_21]: And he'll never win because it's not his logo to begin with.

2072
02:46:14,220 --> 02:46:17,983
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh yeah, it predates his company by like, what, five years?

2073
02:46:19,724 --> 02:46:21,165
[SPEAKER_21]: Ultracade, by the way, sucks.

2074
02:46:21,786 --> 02:46:22,647
[SPEAKER_18]: Ultracade sucks.

2075
02:46:22,947 --> 02:46:28,091
[SPEAKER_18]: And I bet you if you take apart an Ultracade and decompile his source code, I bet you that it's made anyway.

2076
02:46:28,792 --> 02:46:29,312
[SPEAKER_18]: Faster.

2077
02:46:31,994 --> 02:46:34,697
[SPEAKER_18]: And that's about it.

2078
02:46:34,857 --> 02:46:36,338
[SPEAKER_18]: Ultracades need to burn in hell.

2079
02:46:36,678 --> 02:46:39,541
[SPEAKER_18]: And I was all down with Ultracade because I'm like, dude, that's a good idea.

2080
02:46:40,265 --> 02:46:44,889
[SPEAKER_15]: I was going to save that for, you know, our podcast, but whatever.

2081
02:46:46,370 --> 02:46:47,051
[SPEAKER_15]: Hey, that's all good.

2082
02:46:47,651 --> 02:46:48,352
[SPEAKER_18]: Sorry about that.

2083
02:46:48,572 --> 02:46:49,172
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, no biggie.

2084
02:46:49,533 --> 02:46:50,533
[SPEAKER_18]: Talk about it on the show.

2085
02:46:51,274 --> 02:46:52,715
[SPEAKER_18]: Say fuck off to Ultracade.

2086
02:46:53,556 --> 02:46:54,537
[SPEAKER_18]: Y'all go to arcades.

2087
02:46:54,917 --> 02:46:57,819
[SPEAKER_18]: You go to arcades, kick the Ultracade when you walk by it.

2088
02:46:59,101 --> 02:47:00,021
[SPEAKER_18]: I did yesterday.

2089
02:47:00,802 --> 02:47:02,383
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm not just talking boot at once.

2090
02:47:02,403 --> 02:47:05,045
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm talking kick the fucking hell out of it.

2091
02:47:05,065 --> 02:47:05,386
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay.

2092
02:47:06,226 --> 02:47:06,667
[SPEAKER_17]: You know what?

2093
02:47:06,847 --> 02:47:08,048
[SPEAKER_17]: We'll make that the first...

2094
02:47:08,755 --> 02:47:37,329
[SPEAKER_15]: Church of Orange Lounge Proclamation Kick the Ultracade Commandment 1 When thou see an Ultracade machine Or an Arcade Legends Thou will kick it with thy boot Several times Or boot it with your kick That is the first official proclamation of the Church of Orange Lounge I hope you're writing this down Ultracade Thou shalt boot There will be a quiz Yes there will Alright

2095
02:47:37,694 --> 02:47:40,575
[SPEAKER_15]: Let's move on to the chatroom FUs, unless you had anything else.

2096
02:47:41,636 --> 02:47:41,976
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm done.

2097
02:47:42,856 --> 02:47:43,397
[SPEAKER_18]: Fuck all for me.

2098
02:47:43,557 --> 02:47:44,177
[SPEAKER_18]: I want chocolate.

2099
02:47:46,078 --> 02:47:48,579
[SPEAKER_15]: I've been eating like so much ice cream today, it's disgusting.

2100
02:47:48,739 --> 02:47:49,559
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm rating Rob Scrooge.

2101
02:47:51,560 --> 02:47:53,881
[SPEAKER_15]: Alright, let's go on to the next chatroom FUs.

2102
02:47:56,302 --> 02:48:04,886
[SPEAKER_15]: Zaku, our old buddy Zaku, the metalhead, says FU to actor-director Clint Eastwood for denying veteran director Martin Scorsese his chance at an Oscar.

2103
02:48:06,334 --> 02:48:09,036
[SPEAKER_18]: If Martin Scorsese wasn't such a cocksucker, he'd win more awards.

2104
02:48:13,680 --> 02:48:14,841
[SPEAKER_15]: Clint Eastwood deserved it.

2105
02:48:15,662 --> 02:48:17,903
[SPEAKER_15]: Don't get in another argument with him, please.

2106
02:48:18,023 --> 02:48:20,425
[SPEAKER_15]: Can you give the man a hug, please, Dan?

2107
02:48:20,485 --> 02:48:20,846
[SPEAKER_15]: Negative.

2108
02:48:23,368 --> 02:48:24,068
[SPEAKER_15]: Can you try?

2109
02:48:24,128 --> 02:48:25,470
[SPEAKER_15]: Can you give the man a cyber hug?

2110
02:48:25,710 --> 02:48:29,092
[SPEAKER_18]: If he's a real metalhead, he's all greasy and nasty and doesn't want to be hugged.

2111
02:48:30,133 --> 02:48:31,074
[SPEAKER_15]: All right, fine.

2112
02:48:31,374 --> 02:48:32,295
[SPEAKER_15]: How about a handshake?

2113
02:48:32,555 --> 02:48:33,276
[SPEAKER_15]: How about a handshake?

2114
02:48:34,277 --> 02:48:35,377
[SPEAKER_18]: I'll give him a bong hit.

2115
02:48:35,598 --> 02:48:35,918
[SPEAKER_15]: All right.

2116
02:48:36,776 --> 02:48:38,457
[SPEAKER_15]: Loki, what were you going to add to that?

2117
02:48:40,218 --> 02:48:40,698
[SPEAKER_21]: Nothing?

2118
02:48:42,019 --> 02:48:42,459
[SPEAKER_20]: Nothing.

2119
02:48:44,900 --> 02:48:49,862
[SPEAKER_15]: F you to my mouth being held tightly by a rubber band because of my braces and the pain it brings.

2120
02:48:50,343 --> 02:48:51,063
[SPEAKER_15]: I've been there.

2121
02:48:51,363 --> 02:48:51,863
[SPEAKER_15]: It's horrible.

2122
02:48:52,664 --> 02:48:55,305
[SPEAKER_15]: F you to having two unmerciful midterms this week.

2123
02:48:55,345 --> 02:48:59,387
[SPEAKER_15]: And F you to people that rag on Dillager Escape Plan's song in Guitadora V.

2124
02:49:01,431 --> 02:49:04,872
[SPEAKER_15]: Illusion says, F you to all the freeze pop haters.

2125
02:49:04,972 --> 02:49:06,612
[SPEAKER_15]: It's all about fancy ultra fresh.

2126
02:49:07,152 --> 02:49:10,913
[SPEAKER_15]: I read a review that said the CD sucked and it was better used as a frisbee.

2127
02:49:11,593 --> 02:49:16,554
[SPEAKER_15]: Then I scrolled up on the page and saw their glowing review of Yellow Card CD, Ocean Avenue.

2128
02:49:16,894 --> 02:49:18,135
[SPEAKER_15]: Then I said, oh, I get it.

2129
02:49:18,175 --> 02:49:19,455
[SPEAKER_15]: You have horrible taste in music.

2130
02:49:19,915 --> 02:49:21,075
[SPEAKER_15]: Anyway, I'm rambling.

2131
02:49:21,956 --> 02:49:22,856
[SPEAKER_15]: F you to Jamie.

2132
02:49:23,076 --> 02:49:24,736
[SPEAKER_15]: It was one week from retirement.

2133
02:49:24,976 --> 02:49:25,476
[SPEAKER_15]: One week.

2134
02:49:27,277 --> 02:49:27,777
[SPEAKER_10]: You know what?

2135
02:49:27,877 --> 02:49:28,497
[SPEAKER_10]: Suck it up.

2136
02:49:30,205 --> 02:49:31,586
[SPEAKER_15]: Got told, bitches!

2137
02:49:31,606 --> 02:49:36,468
[SPEAKER_13]: If your song was good, it would have made it the four weeks, but it sucked!

2138
02:49:37,729 --> 02:49:40,810
[SPEAKER_15]: No, better yet, F you to the people that voted for the song.

2139
02:49:43,112 --> 02:49:45,953
[SPEAKER_15]: Illusion continues on saying, P.S.

2140
02:49:46,253 --> 02:49:50,495
[SPEAKER_15]: F you to that awful Guitar Freaks drum mania song that you played earlier.

2141
02:49:50,916 --> 02:49:52,937
[SPEAKER_15]: It's like my ears were on there, period.

2142
02:49:55,058 --> 02:49:55,658
[SPEAKER_11]: No, man.

2143
02:49:55,678 --> 02:49:56,679
[SPEAKER_11]: No, no, no, no, no.

2144
02:49:56,919 --> 02:49:59,260
[SPEAKER_11]: I take offense to this because...

2145
02:49:59,878 --> 02:50:03,301
[SPEAKER_11]: No man will ever, ever know what that's like.

2146
02:50:04,461 --> 02:50:06,843
[SPEAKER_11]: No one will ever know what the pain of PMS is.

2147
02:50:07,944 --> 02:50:09,605
[SPEAKER_11]: That's why we have to share with our attitude.

2148
02:50:09,685 --> 02:50:10,666
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, I think we do.

2149
02:50:17,071 --> 02:50:18,792
[SPEAKER_18]: You'd like to think that, wouldn't you?

2150
02:50:19,492 --> 02:50:24,796
[SPEAKER_11]: No, see, we have to suffer the physical pain, so we share the emotional pain with you.

2151
02:50:24,836 --> 02:50:27,238
[SPEAKER_18]: Come on, what's worse, physical or emotional pain?

2152
02:50:29,702 --> 02:50:31,722
[SPEAKER_18]: Life Long Torture.

2153
02:50:31,902 --> 02:50:32,483
[SPEAKER_10]: That's okay.

2154
02:50:32,523 --> 02:50:34,623
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll just get advice for your balls next time.

2155
02:50:34,643 --> 02:50:36,403
[SPEAKER_18]: It's Punishment From Above.

2156
02:50:41,685 --> 02:50:43,825
[SPEAKER_18]: I'd like to level a fuck you to PMS.

2157
02:50:45,265 --> 02:50:49,526
[SPEAKER_18]: That goddamn excuse for women to be bitchy doesn't need to exist.

2158
02:50:50,866 --> 02:50:51,847
[SPEAKER_18]: Fucking deal with it.

2159
02:50:51,887 --> 02:50:55,587
[SPEAKER_18]: It's going to happen for the rest of your life.

2160
02:50:57,748 --> 02:50:58,168
[SPEAKER_10]: No, it won't.

2161
02:50:58,937 --> 02:51:03,261
[SPEAKER_10]: When menopause hits, you get it every day for the rest of your life.

2162
02:51:03,281 --> 02:51:05,262
[SPEAKER_17]: I've still got like seven people to go through.

2163
02:51:05,382 --> 02:51:06,463
[SPEAKER_17]: That's when you get killed.

2164
02:51:07,084 --> 02:51:08,785
[SPEAKER_17]: I heard it here first.

2165
02:51:12,508 --> 02:51:13,889
[SPEAKER_18]: Did you ever see Logan's run?

2166
02:51:15,911 --> 02:51:16,571
[SPEAKER_18]: Exactly.

2167
02:51:17,272 --> 02:51:18,072
[SPEAKER_10]: We've got a runner.

2168
02:51:18,693 --> 02:51:25,598
[SPEAKER_13]: You know that when they're pregnant, they're front heavy, so when you just put them next to a cliff or something, two birds with one stone, man.

2169
02:51:26,980 --> 02:51:27,360
[SPEAKER_18]: Nice.

2170
02:51:29,035 --> 02:51:32,739
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh, hey, look, what are you doing throwing the weasel at somebody, or the weasel?

2171
02:51:32,759 --> 02:51:35,362
[SPEAKER_18]: What are you doing throwing the ferret at somebody else?

2172
02:51:35,943 --> 02:51:36,423
[SPEAKER_18]: Slut.

2173
02:51:36,944 --> 02:51:38,105
[SPEAKER_10]: I used to throw it at Rob.

2174
02:51:38,125 --> 02:51:41,188
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh yeah, but we know Rob's not going to throw it at me.

2175
02:51:41,208 --> 02:51:44,652
[SPEAKER_15]: My cheeks hurt from laughing so hard, okay?

2176
02:51:45,092 --> 02:51:45,533
[SPEAKER_15]: Seriously.

2177
02:51:45,553 --> 02:51:45,773
[SPEAKER_15]: Seriously.

2178
02:51:48,672 --> 02:51:54,756
[SPEAKER_15]: Lama Juice says, F you to Fred who works at Red Octane and I'm so damn glad his ass got fired.

2179
02:51:54,796 --> 02:51:59,059
[SPEAKER_15]: He lost a lot of people's orders making me wait another month for my Octane pad.

2180
02:51:59,739 --> 02:52:04,963
[SPEAKER_15]: F you to school because apparently they had no problem sending them to GameStop, however.

2181
02:52:05,263 --> 02:52:08,405
[SPEAKER_18]: They're all at the GameStop on Marconi.

2182
02:52:10,066 --> 02:52:12,488
[SPEAKER_18]: Come and buy your damn dance pad.

2183
02:52:13,200 --> 02:52:19,602
[SPEAKER_18]: A big F you to the GameStop Distribution Center for sending me 14 red octane ignition pads.

2184
02:52:21,023 --> 02:52:24,544
[SPEAKER_15]: Llama Juice also says F you to school because I have to wake up early tomorrow.

2185
02:52:25,224 --> 02:52:28,805
[SPEAKER_15]: And F you to anyone whose name starts with a J, just because I can.

2186
02:52:29,486 --> 02:52:29,986
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, wait.

2187
02:52:30,786 --> 02:52:32,447
[SPEAKER_15]: Jamie has an issue with that.

2188
02:52:33,587 --> 02:52:34,187
[SPEAKER_11]: Fuck you.

2189
02:52:34,347 --> 02:52:34,827
[SPEAKER_11]: Who was that?

2190
02:52:35,268 --> 02:52:35,888
[SPEAKER_15]: Llama Juice.

2191
02:52:36,448 --> 02:52:36,888
[SPEAKER_11]: Fuck you.

2192
02:52:37,668 --> 02:52:38,209
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, yeah.

2193
02:52:38,349 --> 02:52:39,109
[SPEAKER_15]: Llama Juice.

2194
02:52:40,360 --> 02:52:43,501
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh yeah, and F you to anyone who can't pronounce my name correctly.

2195
02:52:43,901 --> 02:52:45,982
[SPEAKER_15]: Leama Juice, WTF.

2196
02:52:46,442 --> 02:52:47,702
[SPEAKER_15]: Leama Juice.

2197
02:52:51,763 --> 02:52:59,565
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, if you name yourself after an animal, a butt ugly one at that, expect to have the name pronounced like damn animals is.

2198
02:53:00,426 --> 02:53:02,686
[SPEAKER_15]: Ooh, Jamie's on the warpath now after the J comment.

2199
02:53:03,487 --> 02:53:08,268
[SPEAKER_15]: DarkLionXVI says, F you to the gangster that hit my cousin in the head with a hammer four times.

2200
02:53:08,448 --> 02:53:08,608
[SPEAKER_15]: Ouch.

2201
02:53:09,821 --> 02:53:13,083
[SPEAKER_15]: Though my cousin's fine, he suffered a big lump and several stitches.

2202
02:53:13,583 --> 02:53:16,165
[SPEAKER_15]: I want those bastards responsible to be dead in front of me.

2203
02:53:16,525 --> 02:53:16,685
[SPEAKER_15]: Ouch.

2204
02:53:17,185 --> 02:53:20,407
[SPEAKER_20]: Either that hammer was too small or that gangsta wasn't swinging very hard.

2205
02:53:21,027 --> 02:53:21,347
[SPEAKER_15]: You know what?

2206
02:53:21,388 --> 02:53:24,009
[SPEAKER_15]: Somebody was just trying to imitate Donkey Kong where they had...

2207
02:53:29,524 --> 02:53:32,386
[SPEAKER_15]: DarkLionXVI says, F you to the right side of my body.

2208
02:53:32,746 --> 02:53:37,970
[SPEAKER_15]: Whenever I play 2DX and the note pattern dominates the right hand side, my right arm gets numb.

2209
02:53:39,451 --> 02:53:40,832
[SPEAKER_15]: I just hope it's not a stroke.

2210
02:53:42,490 --> 02:53:52,517
[SPEAKER_13]: I completely know what you mean, because you know, when I'm masturbating vigorously, you know, my rights, I get numbed too sometimes, so it's totally understandable.

2211
02:53:52,557 --> 02:53:55,659
[SPEAKER_18]: I knew as soon as somebody said stroke, there was going to be a joke.

2212
02:53:59,741 --> 02:54:04,424
[SPEAKER_15]: Alright, Angel says, F you to me feeling like shit, Tearsniff.

2213
02:54:04,804 --> 02:54:08,967
[SPEAKER_15]: You'll notice she's not here tonight, that's because she is giving an F you because she feels like shit.

2214
02:54:13,223 --> 02:54:14,504
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.

2215
02:54:14,564 --> 02:54:14,884
[SPEAKER_15]: Moving on.

2216
02:54:17,105 --> 02:54:25,590
[SPEAKER_15]: Flareone says, F you to Roanert Park, Scandia, for getting Madden Football as their token one new game every six months arcade game.

2217
02:54:26,111 --> 02:54:29,553
[SPEAKER_15]: Also, fuck them for hypnotizing me into losing my keys there last night.

2218
02:54:32,298 --> 02:54:37,561
[SPEAKER_15]: StepItOff, 1215, says, F you to all the good games coming out at the same time so I can't afford them.

2219
02:54:37,941 --> 02:54:42,923
[SPEAKER_15]: And F you to the people who don't show up for Outside the Box, but I appreciate what Sky did on Thursday because the chat was great.

2220
02:54:43,203 --> 02:54:43,564
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

2221
02:54:45,064 --> 02:54:47,906
[SPEAKER_15]: DJ Ranma S says, F you to Million Dollar Baby, yo.

2222
02:54:47,986 --> 02:54:51,348
[SPEAKER_15]: Explain to me how the fuck does a movie that barely anyone heard of win?

2223
02:54:51,428 --> 02:54:52,308
[SPEAKER_15]: Someone pass me a 40.

2224
02:54:54,869 --> 02:54:57,171
[SPEAKER_15]: And lastly, SSJ100Matt,

2225
02:54:58,615 --> 02:55:02,959
[SPEAKER_15]: says F you the week to me, to Skype, for playing the tub girl theme.

2226
02:55:03,099 --> 02:55:06,001
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, Christina Aguilera's dirty on Thursday's show.

2227
02:55:06,622 --> 02:55:07,102
[SPEAKER_15]: Long story.

2228
02:55:08,804 --> 02:55:13,488
[SPEAKER_15]: And also an F you to Scorsese being screwed over for the Best Director Oscar.

2229
02:55:17,331 --> 02:55:19,072
[SPEAKER_18]: He got screwed so he gets an F you?

2230
02:55:20,493 --> 02:55:20,934
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't know.

2231
02:55:21,354 --> 02:55:22,975
[SPEAKER_18]: He doesn't get an F you for being a jerk.

2232
02:55:24,297 --> 02:55:25,958
[SPEAKER_18]: You know we're going to hear about this for months.

2233
02:55:28,757 --> 02:55:31,099
[SPEAKER_15]: It'll be on entertainment tonight, all night long.

2234
02:55:31,299 --> 02:55:31,820
[SPEAKER_15]: Tomorrow night.

2235
02:55:31,840 --> 02:55:37,845
[SPEAKER_18]: Seriously, you'll go to a news site and it'll be like, Scorsese fucks for the Oscars.

2236
02:55:37,945 --> 02:55:42,348
[SPEAKER_13]: You know what I heard today from my sister?

2237
02:55:42,669 --> 02:55:47,993
[SPEAKER_13]: She's telling me that there's a show that's called Celebrities Without Makeup.

2238
02:55:49,114 --> 02:55:52,977
[SPEAKER_15]: It's played after American Idol and it's just ugly ass celebrities.

2239
02:55:53,317 --> 02:55:57,681
[SPEAKER_15]: There was a big post It premiered on Thursday It was ugly.

2240
02:55:59,586 --> 02:56:00,566
[SPEAKER_18]: The Simpsons The Simpsons

2241
02:56:24,244 --> 02:56:26,625
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, American Idol is their top-rated program.

2242
02:56:26,665 --> 02:56:27,285
[SPEAKER_15]: You gotta give them that.

2243
02:56:27,305 --> 02:56:28,285
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, yeah, but come on, man.

2244
02:56:28,545 --> 02:56:30,026
[SPEAKER_18]: What's Fox's show?

2245
02:56:31,246 --> 02:56:31,667
[SPEAKER_18]: Like, what?

2246
02:56:31,927 --> 02:56:33,787
[SPEAKER_18]: It's on season, like, 3,406?

2247
02:56:34,127 --> 02:56:38,429
[SPEAKER_15]: It's been going a while.

2248
02:56:38,649 --> 02:56:41,110
[SPEAKER_18]: In the next episode, Homer becomes a psycho killer.

2249
02:56:41,130 --> 02:56:44,791
[SPEAKER_15]: Fox didn't have Seinfeld.

2250
02:56:44,811 --> 02:56:46,332
[SPEAKER_15]: That was NBC.

2251
02:56:46,672 --> 02:56:47,272
[SPEAKER_15]: What's her name?

2252
02:56:47,352 --> 02:56:49,653
[SPEAKER_15]: Patsy is a lesbian on it now.

2253
02:56:49,673 --> 02:56:50,233
[SPEAKER_15]: No, Patty is a lesbian.

2254
02:56:50,253 --> 02:56:50,613
[SPEAKER_15]: Patty.

2255
02:56:50,813 --> 02:56:51,053
[SPEAKER_15]: Whatever.

2256
02:56:51,073 --> 02:56:51,553
[SPEAKER_15]: Patsy, Patty, same thing.

2257
02:56:51,573 --> 02:56:53,054
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, it's like, who the hell didn't see that coming?

2258
02:56:55,589 --> 02:56:57,530
[SPEAKER_15]: So when did they get their AIDS character?

2259
02:56:58,430 --> 02:56:59,431
[SPEAKER_15]: Like Sesame Street.

2260
02:57:01,432 --> 02:57:02,372
[SPEAKER_15]: Like Sesame Street?

2261
02:57:03,033 --> 02:57:11,076
[SPEAKER_15]: That was Sesame Street, Africa that had the character because a lot of folks in that region where that Sesame Street was, it's a very real problem they have there.

2262
02:57:12,717 --> 02:57:14,318
[SPEAKER_18]: Hey, what do you think got Mr. Hooper?

2263
02:57:15,538 --> 02:57:20,221
[SPEAKER_15]: All those, you know, monkey lovers out there.

2264
02:57:20,281 --> 02:57:21,641
[SPEAKER_19]: What is Grover anyway?

2265
02:57:23,102 --> 02:57:23,722
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't know.

2266
02:57:23,862 --> 02:57:24,843
[SPEAKER_11]: He's adorable.

2267
02:57:26,570 --> 02:57:27,130
[SPEAKER_13]: No, he's not.

2268
02:57:27,150 --> 02:57:28,851
[SPEAKER_13]: He's a fucking, like... Near?

2269
02:57:29,191 --> 02:57:32,353
[SPEAKER_11]: No, because... He's an illegal immigrant is what he is.

2270
02:57:32,713 --> 02:57:33,773
[SPEAKER_13]: From where?

2271
02:57:34,394 --> 02:57:36,134
[SPEAKER_13]: They're all fucking hiding in the alleys.

2272
02:57:37,355 --> 02:57:38,776
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

2273
02:57:40,276 --> 02:57:41,757
[SPEAKER_18]: They all live in Oscar's trash can.

2274
02:57:41,917 --> 02:57:42,797
[SPEAKER_13]: Because you know what?

2275
02:57:42,958 --> 02:57:44,518
[SPEAKER_13]: You know that market that's on the street?

2276
02:57:44,578 --> 02:57:45,299
[SPEAKER_13]: It's a big front.

2277
02:57:45,319 --> 02:57:48,360
[SPEAKER_13]: It's a big, you know, fucking heroin and all sorts of drugs.

2278
02:57:48,420 --> 02:57:50,861
[SPEAKER_11]: If I had an illegal immigrant living in my house, I'd be a grouch, too.

2279
02:57:52,102 --> 02:57:53,122
[SPEAKER_11]: And Snuffleupagus?

2280
02:57:53,422 --> 02:57:54,703
[SPEAKER_15]: Man, what a pot fiend.

2281
02:57:56,163 --> 02:57:58,405
[SPEAKER_19]: And what about Big Bert?

2282
02:58:00,267 --> 02:58:00,868
[SPEAKER_15]: Total queer.

2283
02:58:03,591 --> 02:58:04,992
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, we already know about Bert and Ernie.

2284
02:58:05,553 --> 02:58:06,314
[SPEAKER_11]: And Bert is evil.

2285
02:58:08,115 --> 02:58:10,498
[SPEAKER_11]: I am so mad that the Bert is evil side is gone.

2286
02:58:11,018 --> 02:58:11,599
[SPEAKER_11]: It's gone?

2287
02:58:11,699 --> 02:58:12,400
[SPEAKER_11]: What happened to it?

2288
02:58:13,323 --> 02:58:14,964
[SPEAKER_11]: It's been gone for some time.

2289
02:58:15,004 --> 02:58:17,704
[SPEAKER_11]: I think someone mirrored it, but the original site's gone.

2290
02:58:18,185 --> 02:58:20,465
[SPEAKER_15]: Did PBS slam the Iron Fist of Justice on their ass?

2291
02:58:20,485 --> 02:58:21,706
[SPEAKER_18]: It was only up for like 600 years, probably.

2292
02:58:21,766 --> 02:58:23,486
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know, but... Oh, how sad.

2293
02:58:23,706 --> 02:58:26,767
[SPEAKER_18]: The Children's Television Workshop got medieval on their ass.

2294
02:58:27,828 --> 02:58:28,228
[SPEAKER_15]: All right.

2295
02:58:28,688 --> 02:58:32,409
[SPEAKER_15]: One more story for you guys, and then it's about time to start calling it a show.

2296
02:58:33,330 --> 02:58:37,171
[SPEAKER_15]: Red Octane, the group that creates the Ignition Pad.

2297
02:58:37,191 --> 02:58:39,031
[SPEAKER_15]: Come to the GameStop Walmart.

2298
02:58:39,052 --> 02:58:40,392
[SPEAKER_15]: We've got millions of them.

2299
02:58:41,730 --> 02:58:45,113
[SPEAKER_15]: They're going to be publishing video games for the PlayStation 2.

2300
02:58:46,514 --> 02:58:53,559
[SPEAKER_15]: Interesting, because Red Octane, to this point, has always been like a distributor, a pad maker, and they've never really made games.

2301
02:58:54,779 --> 02:58:55,880
[SPEAKER_15]: Not that kind of pad maker.

2302
02:58:57,141 --> 02:58:58,502
[SPEAKER_15]: Wow, they've never made games.

2303
02:58:58,682 --> 02:59:00,564
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm sure their games are just going to rock.

2304
02:59:01,124 --> 02:59:04,587
[SPEAKER_13]: They're going to be awesome, because they have so much experience in making games.

2305
02:59:04,727 --> 02:59:06,188
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh wait, no they don't!

2306
02:59:06,368 --> 02:59:08,790
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, they're not actually making the game, they're just going to distribute it.

2307
02:59:08,810 --> 02:59:10,671
[SPEAKER_15]: They're going to be publishing the software.

2308
02:59:11,718 --> 02:59:15,940
[SPEAKER_15]: The first title for the PlayStation 2 computer entertainment system will be announced in spring of 2005.

2309
02:59:16,360 --> 02:59:25,924
[SPEAKER_15]: Kai Huang, president of Red Octane, says, Launching into a new business segment with the publishing of video games is a natural evolution for us.

2310
02:59:26,324 --> 02:59:33,727
[SPEAKER_15]: We are committed to delivering the same high quality and fun found in our peripherals with the upcoming Red Octane software line.

2311
02:59:34,827 --> 02:59:39,249
[SPEAKER_18]: So everybody, buy Red Octane accessories now, because they're going out of business.

2312
02:59:41,829 --> 02:59:51,257
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, you know, you can look at this as a good thing or a bad thing.

2313
02:59:51,797 --> 02:59:55,701
[SPEAKER_18]: Are there any, like, great dancing franchises or something that happen from over here?

2314
02:59:56,701 --> 02:59:57,442
[SPEAKER_13]: I smell something.

2315
02:59:57,462 --> 03:00:02,206
[SPEAKER_21]: I smell a distributor for In the Groove.

2316
03:00:03,387 --> 03:00:06,990
[SPEAKER_15]: I was just about to say, wouldn't that be hilarious if the title they end up announcing is In the Groove?

2317
03:00:07,566 --> 03:00:10,767
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh my god, Bomani Scene would not shut up for months.

2318
03:00:11,047 --> 03:00:12,208
[SPEAKER_15]: They would not shut up.

2319
03:00:12,688 --> 03:00:16,989
[SPEAKER_15]: You could shoot them in the face and they would not shut up about this.

2320
03:00:17,850 --> 03:00:19,070
[SPEAKER_15]: If that's what they end up publishing.

2321
03:00:19,090 --> 03:00:22,431
[SPEAKER_18]: Didn't someone just recently announce that they're doing a Pump It Up mix over here too?

2322
03:00:22,611 --> 03:00:22,851
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

2323
03:00:24,292 --> 03:00:24,912
[SPEAKER_18]: Who's doing that?

2324
03:00:26,533 --> 03:00:27,033
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't know.

2325
03:00:27,953 --> 03:00:29,314
[SPEAKER_15]: Mastiff, who did...

2326
03:00:30,424 --> 03:00:31,684
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, Mastiff designed the game.

2327
03:00:31,704 --> 03:00:32,145
[SPEAKER_15]: Designed?

2328
03:00:32,185 --> 03:00:33,545
[SPEAKER_15]: I think Anna Mero's going to put it out.

2329
03:00:34,025 --> 03:00:34,245
[SPEAKER_15]: Who?

2330
03:00:34,445 --> 03:00:36,286
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't... Ah, do we have it on the site?

2331
03:00:36,306 --> 03:00:36,846
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't remember.

2332
03:00:36,866 --> 03:00:37,566
[SPEAKER_18]: Anna Mero did pump it up.

2333
03:00:37,906 --> 03:00:39,447
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, Anna Mero did pump it up originally.

2334
03:00:39,667 --> 03:00:40,927
[SPEAKER_18]: Who would release it in the States?

2335
03:00:41,888 --> 03:00:43,748
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, Mastiff's going to design it.

2336
03:00:43,888 --> 03:00:46,829
[SPEAKER_18]: Mastiff did something else pretty cool recently, I think.

2337
03:00:47,849 --> 03:00:48,330
[SPEAKER_15]: Anna Mero.

2338
03:00:48,350 --> 03:00:49,710
[SPEAKER_18]: All right.

2339
03:00:51,442 --> 03:00:54,044
[SPEAKER_18]: I thought that would be a natural fit for a Red Octane distributor.

2340
03:00:54,064 --> 03:00:56,685
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, that would be good, because then Red Octane can make a whole new pump-it-up pad, too.

2341
03:00:56,705 --> 03:00:57,426
[SPEAKER_15]: That would certainly be interesting.

2342
03:00:57,446 --> 03:01:01,508
[SPEAKER_18]: But unless they have something real popular, Home DDR still sells real well.

2343
03:01:01,708 --> 03:01:06,771
[SPEAKER_18]: I mean, I don't know if anyone here really cares, but... Yeah, how does this... You actually work... Home DDR sells real well.

2344
03:01:06,991 --> 03:01:07,091
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah.

2345
03:01:07,111 --> 03:01:08,652
[SPEAKER_18]: You sell lots of copies.

2346
03:01:08,852 --> 03:01:09,113
[SPEAKER_18]: Mm-hmm.

2347
03:01:10,053 --> 03:01:11,734
[SPEAKER_18]: Why won't people buy fucking ignition pads?

2348
03:01:11,774 --> 03:01:12,194
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't know.

2349
03:01:13,295 --> 03:01:15,076
[SPEAKER_18]: But, uh... But you sell the $20 pads, no problem.

2350
03:01:15,096 --> 03:01:16,977
[SPEAKER_18]: Home DDR... Oh, fucking tons of them.

2351
03:01:17,618 --> 03:01:19,859
[SPEAKER_18]: Because people come back three or four times, like, buy one good one.

2352
03:01:20,019 --> 03:01:20,860
[SPEAKER_18]: No.

2353
03:01:21,080 --> 03:01:21,160
[SPEAKER_05]: Um...

2354
03:01:22,597 --> 03:01:24,399
[SPEAKER_18]: Although no one buys MC Grooves.

2355
03:01:26,040 --> 03:01:33,648
[SPEAKER_18]: So it's like, they're going to release some sort of game, and it's just going to get smoked.

2356
03:01:34,889 --> 03:01:36,331
[SPEAKER_18]: And then Red Octane is going to go out of business.

2357
03:01:37,652 --> 03:01:38,993
[SPEAKER_18]: So get your ignition pads now.

2358
03:01:39,274 --> 03:01:40,175
[SPEAKER_18]: I won't have them forever.

2359
03:01:40,395 --> 03:01:43,278
[SPEAKER_18]: Someone's going to buy those pads, or I'm going to find someone to take them off my hands.

2360
03:01:43,518 --> 03:01:46,541
[SPEAKER_15]: If Red Octane was publishing in the groove...

2361
03:01:47,515 --> 03:01:52,760
[SPEAKER_15]: Doesn't Red Octane have, like, Konami's official blessing to be their pad distributor or something like that?

2362
03:01:53,260 --> 03:01:53,660
[SPEAKER_15]: No.

2363
03:01:54,601 --> 03:02:02,408
[SPEAKER_18]: They're not a licensed pad, but Konami has, I guess, what, didn't Jason Enos say that it's the best pad you can get?

2364
03:02:02,908 --> 03:02:05,671
[SPEAKER_15]: Pretty much, because Konami doesn't really do their own pads anymore.

2365
03:02:05,711 --> 03:02:08,914
[SPEAKER_15]: They did them, like, once in a great-ass while.

2366
03:02:09,554 --> 03:02:14,979
[SPEAKER_18]: I've gone right up to Konami, and I've gone up to Namco when I go to trade shows, and I go to manager conferences, and I say, Hey!

2367
03:02:16,041 --> 03:02:18,364
[SPEAKER_18]: Why the hell can't we get more Konami brand dancepads?

2368
03:02:19,065 --> 03:02:21,368
[SPEAKER_18]: And they go, well, because Konami makes games.

2369
03:02:21,428 --> 03:02:23,470
[SPEAKER_18]: We're not a peripheral manufacturer.

2370
03:02:23,830 --> 03:02:26,113
[SPEAKER_18]: We make enough to promote the sales of the game.

2371
03:02:27,435 --> 03:02:29,197
[SPEAKER_18]: And then we let the third parties take over.

2372
03:02:29,417 --> 03:02:30,579
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's talk to Konami style.

2373
03:02:31,360 --> 03:02:37,382
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, I'm just saying, if it ends up being that it is in the groove, because, you know, it's just kind of the pieces of the puzzle fit together.

2374
03:02:37,682 --> 03:02:40,323
[SPEAKER_15]: Hmm, Red Octane announces they're going to publish a game.

2375
03:02:40,663 --> 03:02:44,325
[SPEAKER_15]: Hmm, in the groove says they want to do a home version, but is looking for a publisher.

2376
03:02:44,625 --> 03:02:45,485
[SPEAKER_15]: Hmm, hmm.

2377
03:02:45,965 --> 03:02:52,027
[SPEAKER_15]: If it all ends up adding together, it would be very interesting to see what that effect has on Red Octane's relationship with Konami.

2378
03:02:52,067 --> 03:02:52,708
[SPEAKER_18]: It won't matter.

2379
03:02:53,428 --> 03:02:53,688
[SPEAKER_15]: Really?

2380
03:02:53,948 --> 03:02:54,168
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah.

2381
03:02:54,688 --> 03:02:59,470
[SPEAKER_18]: Because, again, Red Octane does not operate with the explicit...

2382
03:03:01,030 --> 03:03:02,291
[SPEAKER_18]: They don't license Konami.

2383
03:03:02,311 --> 03:03:08,175
[SPEAKER_18]: That's why the red octane pad doesn't look just like what you'd think a Konami pad would look like.

2384
03:03:08,195 --> 03:03:09,015
[SPEAKER_18]: It looks real similar.

2385
03:03:09,155 --> 03:03:09,416
[SPEAKER_15]: Right.

2386
03:03:09,776 --> 03:03:10,536
[SPEAKER_18]: But it looks different.

2387
03:03:12,338 --> 03:03:13,699
[SPEAKER_18]: It's a totally different sort of thing.

2388
03:03:14,059 --> 03:03:22,324
[SPEAKER_18]: Just because Konami says, yeah, these pads don't suck, wouldn't it suck if the official Konami manufacturer was Mad Catz?

2389
03:03:24,266 --> 03:03:25,046
[SPEAKER_15]: That would be true.

2390
03:03:25,186 --> 03:03:30,730
[SPEAKER_18]: Konami's going to say, hey, look, you can get dance pads from any of these companies out there because it saves them having to make them.

2391
03:03:31,829 --> 03:03:33,570
[SPEAKER_18]: But it still lets their products sell.

2392
03:03:34,791 --> 03:03:38,413
[SPEAKER_18]: So they may as well say that somebody's the best, and apparently that was Red Octane.

2393
03:03:40,594 --> 03:03:49,619
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, it'll just be interesting to see how things heat up when In The Groove does possibly find the publisher.

2394
03:03:50,039 --> 03:03:51,479
[SPEAKER_18]: Does In The Groove use a different pad layout?

2395
03:03:51,560 --> 03:03:52,800
[SPEAKER_15]: No, it's the same pad layout.

2396
03:03:53,441 --> 03:03:54,601
[SPEAKER_18]: Then why would it be?

2397
03:03:54,881 --> 03:03:56,582
[SPEAKER_15]: Because it's competition for Konami.

2398
03:03:56,742 --> 03:03:57,923
[SPEAKER_18]: It's not competition for Konami.

2399
03:04:00,401 --> 03:04:05,624
[SPEAKER_18]: It's like if I went out and I made a flip cartoon and tried to put it up against, you know, the Incredibles.

2400
03:04:07,865 --> 03:04:08,706
[SPEAKER_18]: I'd get crushed.

2401
03:04:09,386 --> 03:04:10,187
[SPEAKER_18]: Crushed.

2402
03:04:10,727 --> 03:04:12,348
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, I mean, we'll see what happens.

2403
03:04:12,388 --> 03:04:12,968
[SPEAKER_15]: We'll see what happens.

2404
03:04:13,668 --> 03:04:13,869
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

2405
03:04:14,189 --> 03:04:14,429
[SPEAKER_15]: All right.

2406
03:04:14,489 --> 03:04:15,469
[SPEAKER_15]: Anyway, we got to wrap it up, though.

2407
03:04:15,509 --> 03:04:18,791
[SPEAKER_15]: We got to go around and get everybody's final thoughts because it's time to wrap up the show.

2408
03:04:18,971 --> 03:04:19,852
[SPEAKER_15]: Dan, your final thought.

2409
03:04:20,592 --> 03:04:21,853
[SPEAKER_18]: Red Oxen Edition pads.

2410
03:04:22,273 --> 03:04:23,574
[SPEAKER_18]: GameStop on Marconi.

2411
03:04:24,514 --> 03:04:25,135
[SPEAKER_18]: Come and get them.

2412
03:04:26,455 --> 03:04:27,656
[SPEAKER_15]: Loki, your final thought.

2413
03:04:30,714 --> 03:04:32,435
[SPEAKER_15]: Go outside.

2414
03:04:33,095 --> 03:04:34,456
[SPEAKER_21]: Except if it's GameStop.

2415
03:04:34,496 --> 03:04:37,857
[SPEAKER_21]: If it's GameStop, invite the red octane ignition pads.

2416
03:04:38,818 --> 03:04:40,298
[SPEAKER_21]: Because, you know what?

2417
03:04:41,799 --> 03:04:42,279
[SPEAKER_15]: You need them.

2418
03:04:42,999 --> 03:04:43,740
[SPEAKER_15]: You need to buy them.

2419
03:04:44,300 --> 03:04:45,420
[SPEAKER_15]: Plus, they're comfy to sit on.

2420
03:04:48,302 --> 03:04:51,443
[SPEAKER_15]: My final thought is, um, I want a beer.

2421
03:04:57,141 --> 03:05:01,724
[SPEAKER_15]: I want a beer to not spill on my new ignition pad that I bought for the GameStop on Marconi.

2422
03:05:03,105 --> 03:05:03,866
[SPEAKER_15]: Jamie, your final thought.

2423
03:05:05,367 --> 03:05:06,228
[SPEAKER_11]: Ouch.

2424
03:05:08,149 --> 03:05:09,970
[SPEAKER_11]: I need an ignition pad for my pain.

2425
03:05:10,031 --> 03:05:12,592
[SPEAKER_11]: From GameStop.

2426
03:05:12,973 --> 03:05:13,493
[SPEAKER_11]: From GameStop.

2427
03:05:13,553 --> 03:05:13,974
[SPEAKER_11]: On Marconi.

2428
03:05:14,134 --> 03:05:15,174
[SPEAKER_11]: On Marconi and Fulton.

2429
03:05:15,455 --> 03:05:15,875
[SPEAKER_15]: Alright.

2430
03:05:16,616 --> 03:05:17,937
[SPEAKER_15]: Final word of the show.

2431
03:05:18,537 --> 03:05:21,739
[SPEAKER_15]: One word and one word only to wrap it all up.

2432
03:05:21,840 --> 03:05:23,801
[SPEAKER_15]: Sum up tonight's show in one word.

2433
03:05:24,382 --> 03:05:25,562
[SPEAKER_15]: You know I gotta give it to Dan.

2434
03:05:25,923 --> 03:05:26,223
[SPEAKER_15]: Dan?

2435
03:05:26,243 --> 03:05:26,303
[SPEAKER_15]: Dan?

2436
03:05:26,670 --> 03:05:28,090
[SPEAKER_15]: What is tonight's final word?
