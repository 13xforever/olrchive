85905	91029	You can hear the sound of the wind, flowing, flowing, and this time, the sound of the wind.
91109	94212	I'll listen to the sound of the wind, and I'll stack up my mirrors.
94352	97394	I want to get the same feeling, a life that's irreplaceable.
97534	100056	It's a dream I had when I was young.

382741	386342	I mean, you got it tomorrow, so, you know, might as well talk about it today.
387322	391844	I'm sure we'll be talking about that as well as some of the stuff going on in the Bomani scene.
391864	392124	There's a
392674	395657	There's some interesting stuff going on out there, so we've got to definitely talk about that.

428492	433433	Although, I don't know, we might want to turn it on later to show... Yeah, we're probably going to turn it on a little later, it's just not on right now.

437855	442396	So, without further ado, we're going to get to some music, start off tonight's show.
443169	448233	and I figured since tomorrow is Valentine's Day we'll do some appropriately themed love songs.
448894	449394	Kinda.
449914	450195	I don't know.
450235	452696	I think I'm stretching it with a couple of them here but we'll see.

761460	767504	This is radio station CJ Boogie with a brand new world premiere song for Captain Jack, Only You.
851705	857567	Please listen to Orange Lounge Radio, because real radio makes Captain Jack cry.
862308	867270	Hello boys and girls, and welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 131.
868210	871791	In progress, we're here on this Valentine's Day eve.
873035	877599	Happy Valentine's Day to all you lovebirds out there, all you happy, sweet little couples.
878600	881922	And to the rest of you, happy Bitter Singles Awareness Day.
882202	885905	Yes, you're in the same boat that I am, so the next break of songs will be for you.
887066	890930	I'm going to pick some good bitter, angry songs for the next break.
891130	892511	I don't know if there's really a whole lot of
893208	893428	Jamey
914033	915954	AKA DarkSakura is not here tonight.
916534	920016	She is spending Valentine's Day Eve with her man.
920496	925158	Because, you know, she's engaged and, you know, has her hetero life partner or whatever.
925799	927299	I can't remember how she refers to them.
927340	929741	But, you know, they're out and doing their thing.
930541	934123	I guess because tomorrow being a work day, it's a little harder to do stuff.
934163	937905	So they're doing their lovey-dovey stuff tonight.
939525	940886	I suppose we can forgive it.
941426	942687	As long as it's only once a year.
943493	946456	The minute they try to bring Valentine's Day into another holiday, forget it.
946536	947016	It's done with.
951120	953563	Wait a minute, wait, wait.
953963	955424	Loki's saying something about, I'll allow it.
956405	959008	Loki, I thought Valentine's Day was a pain in the ass for you.
959028	965734	I said, I'll allow it, as Judge Mills Lane would say.
967035	967336	Alright.
969864	973487	We'll start off the show as we usually do, playing a little bit of How Was Your Week, How Was Your Day?
974067	979311	And I guess we all know that DarkSakura is the one that usually starts us off, and we all know that she's doing great tonight, I'm sure.
979892	982734	So, you know, well, I guess we'll go to DDR Angel.
982814	984135	DDR Angel, how was your week, how was your day?
984956	987538	Actually, it was kind of depressing for once.
988218	988939	Me, depressed?
989019	989739	Yeah, right.
989879	991400	Okay.
992221	994923	First of all, like, Tuesday when I went to school, everything was fine.
996024	998506	Until, like, just before my second class.
999011	1002512	When I realized my Linux book was missing.
1003492	1006773	And so I was in a slight panic, emailed the teacher, all that stuff.
1007953	1008973	Wondering where the hell it went.
1009293	1015535	And also, in the next 48 hours, I was preparing myself to actually have to go out and buy the book again.
1016255	1024797	But I went to class Thursday, and it turns out that the student that sits next to me decided to grab it on accident.
1024837	1026477	So she ran up to me on...
1027267	1056117	Thursday and gave it back and you know was really apologetic and stuff and so it was just a turn around from a bad situation to a good one again so that turned out really well and the next depressing thing that happened to me is unfortunately permanent so that kind of sucks the radio station I was DJing for KTHR also known as Pulse before it was KTHR um
1056980	1066743	They ended up shutting down this week, so after three years of my life, I'm no longer DJing for a station that I actually like DJing for, so that kind of sucks.
1066763	1071745	You know what, and all that news about what they're doing, I think it's time for us to quit too.
1072586	1083189	Well, it was sad for me because, honestly, if it wasn't for Orange Lounge, I wouldn't have found them or anything like that, and that was two and a half years ago.
1086056	1094442	Something like that, when you went to your buddy's show and boom, next thing you know I'm DJing for them.
1094602	1097004	Oh, that's right.
1097064	1101447	You didn't find out about them until I went and did the guest thing on their network.
1101827	1102607	Yep, that's right.
1102808	1105790	And you know, that DJ, she's back in town this weekend, so it's kind of neat.
1107030	1108852	I don't think she's listening, though.
1108972	1110253	No, she's out.
1110353	1112214	She's either working or she's partying.
1112674	1114215	There's not a whole lot else to do in town with you.
1114235	1115016	Probably partying, you know.
1116118	1116418	Oh yeah.
1116778	1144555	So, you know, I either have a choice of going to a newer radio station or just kind of hanging low and whatever and, you know, if it wasn't, I realize that Orange Lodge was obviously my first radio station I was associated with, so you guys are always going to be first, but as far as, you know, side work was concerned, the other radio station was just what I did and for half the week I was just really down and
1145345	1148689	I still am a little bit, but I'm getting over it a little bit, you know, slowly.
1149469	1157658	Well, you know, and as I said, because you'd mentioned this, and LJ, LiveJournal, for those who don't know, LJ is a place where we can all get a little emo when we need to be.
1158019	1158759	Yeah, really.
1159280	1161462	You made a little bit of an emo post earlier this week.
1161883	1162263	I did.
1162283	1162904	Because you were sad.
1162944	1164806	You were like, I'm so depressed.
1165627	1166788	I really was, though.
1167188	1186426	But, I mean, you know, as I mentioned in LiveJournal, I'll tell you again, for the benefit of our listeners, you know, when a radio station like that closes down, you just have to remember the good memories you have of the people you met there, and, you know, you'll know those people for some time, and some of them will go off and do other projects, and, you know, maybe you can help them out with that, but you'll remember the radio station for a long time.
1186747	1187607	You know, it's inevitable.
1187728	1190230	Orange Lounge Radio will not last forever, you know.
1190660	1192721	The three of us have to die someday.
1194402	1200585	So... I don't plan on dying ever, so... I can't help it.
1200645	1203547	Oh, you clicked on... Oh, you know the secret to immortality then.
1203827	1205028	From that banner on the internet.
1205068	1206849	The secret of... Forget it.
1207089	1207949	Yeah, go fake.
1208369	1213352	Yeah, they sent out one spam mail seeing who had actually, you know, hit on that.
1213612	1215433	And actually one of them was real.
1218455	1218815	Oh, I see.
1218855	1219055	Okay.
1219075	1219155	Okay.
1219542	1220203	And you know what?
1220663	1223606	Not only will I live forever, but my penis is larger than ever.
1227449	1230291	And you're getting V1 Agra really cheap?
1231012	1231432	Exactly.
1231472	1232233	V1 Agra?
1232493	1234235	And my breasts, they're firm and large.
1236597	1243623	Anyway, it's inevitable that Orange Lounge Radio is going to die someday, so I hope you all don't.
1244264	1245365	Get too teary-eyed when it happens.
1245405	1248967	Someday, but I hope not soon, just because... It's not going to happen soon.
1249367	1250428	I don't think so.
1250708	1261736	Unless we get the offer to take this to a real thing, like satellite radio, or go to some television outlet.
1265138	1270822	As I've said this time and time again, I would sell out in .5 seconds to the highest bidder.
1272307	1274748	My soul is up for... I'm putting my soul up on eBay.
1276549	1276789	Anyway.
1277890	1279471	I'd be like, you're going to pay me to do this?
1279871	1280191	Okay.
1281512	1283373	Do you want to pay me for doing Wayne's World?
1283553	1283953	Sure.
1285774	1287955	How did I know you were going to go there?
1288836	1290156	That movie is like my anthem.
1290617	1292257	It's like... Anyway, sorry.
1292478	1293018	I'll shut up now.
1293358	1293558	Angel.
1294238	1297060	Um... Jeez, what else did I get into this week?
1298181	1298921	Uh...
1300296	1301837	Some online game that I can't talk about.
1302857	1303797	Loki knows what I'm talking about.
1303957	1304217	Anyway.
1305598	1307699	Yeah, so that was pretty fun.
1309259	1312720	God, I haven't even been able to play Final Fantasy XI this week.
1313260	1315061	Just because of all the crap that's been going on.
1318062	1318842	I guess that's it.
1318862	1321723	I can't really remember much else.
1321943	1322844	Great.
1323204	1323544	What?
1324004	1326585	I just had to point out, they're making bids in the chat room right now.
1330567	1331168	No comment.
1331248	1333129	I need to learn to keep my mouth shut on this show.
1333390	1339095	I know it would make for interesting radio if I didn't say anything, but every time I open my mouth, I get myself in trouble with the chat room.
1339135	1342017	All I got to do is pay more than I'm making out of my job, which isn't that much.
1342037	1342638	Which isn't much.
1342758	1343919	Some of these bids are making.
1344179	1345340	Some of these bids are making.
1347942	1349524	So far, all but, like, one.
1349544	1353667	Anyway, sorry, Angel.
1353687	1354328	We keep cutting you off.
1354548	1355069	No, it's okay.
1355369	1356009	I would go for the...
1357466	1358187	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
1383331	1390976	Well, kind of, except you don't have, like, the... There's no prostitutes and gamblers and all that stuff that basically... Because you heard this is what happened to Sims Online.
1391016	1397840	Sims Online was supposed to be this, you know, great new online experience game, and it quickly turned into every Vegas street corner.
1398280	1399301	That's fucking awesome.
1400181	1404224	I would play Sims Online if it didn't cost money, just for that.
1404984	1411128	Well, theirs is actually kind of worse, because you end up using your own money to get, you know, game money...
1411713	1412513	and all that stuff.
1412853	1415094	So you kind of have to watch yourself, otherwise you'll go broke.
1415714	1417355	That's the other interesting thing about there.
1417455	1423496	They have made buying the in-game currency with real money, like, not a problem.
1424256	1425957	Seriously, because you'll... That's the way it should be.
1425997	1439541	Whereas every other online role-playing game, you know, Final Fantasy, EverQuest, World of Warcraft, you know, they frown on people selling the gold or the gil or the whatevers outside of the game for real money.
1439821	1440461	But there...
1441829	1443709	I haven't learned jack shit from farming.
1444069	1447170	All I learned is that I might die if I'm not paying attention.
1449970	1454171	Yeah, so, I mean, there's kind of different like that.
1455591	1458292	I ended up getting there married, quote, end quote.
1460032	1460272	Aww.
1460292	1460652	Shut up.
1462433	1463313	It was cute, whatever.
1463433	1464893	So you had an online wedding?
1465973	1466093	Yeah.
1466753	1467493	Only in America.
1468014	1470554	I want a there honeymoon.
1473228	1474849	Yeah, what did you do for the there honeymoon?
1475710	1476871	Um, nothing yet.
1476911	1477651	He said he's going to do it.
1478152	1479633	He said he'll probably do it tonight or whatever.
1479653	1480954	He's going to do it tonight.
1480974	1482014	He's going to do it tonight.
1482034	1483335	Shut the hell up.
1484136	1486558	Hey, it was kind of cool, but he shot me off a cliff.
1487518	1488279	Yeah, shut up.
1488739	1489740	I knew that was going to go there.
1489760	1492042	Can you buy some there condoms with real life money?
1493683	1494824	See, now I got them started.
1494864	1496265	What the hell was I thinking?
1496285	1497846	You better get there morning after pill.
1498559	1501121	Otherwise you're going to have their illegitimate child.
1501382	1503243	Okay, this is just as bad as a piss joke.
1503283	1504504	Who's their baby daddy?
1506786	1507306	Hey now.
1507787	1508087	Sorry.
1508187	1509528	Anyway, he shot me off a cliff.
1509588	1510269	That was kind of funny.
1510869	1511510	Wait, what?
1512771	1517775	We jumped into a buggy, quote unquote, their car, and he hit the boost and I jumped off.
1518255	1519016	We flew off the cliff.
1519076	1519697	It was kind of funny.
1520157	1522279	So you got married and then jumped off a cliff?
1522399	1522559	Yeah.
1523630	1530471	Well, you know, I did watch a story last night about this guy that was trying to get people to commit suicide on Valentine's Day.
1531211	1536052	See, all it takes is one bitter person and they're all dead.
1540573	1541193	Wow.
1541773	1542433	They're dead.
1542453	1548815	If only you guys knew about that game, you probably wouldn't be picking on me so much, but hey, it's always fun.
1549515	1550855	It sounds like fun, it's just I...
1551266	1551526	Firebomber
1580049	1581630	I don't know if it's Boma or Bama.
1582050	1582650	I'm going to say Bama.
1582670	1583971	I like that because it sounds like fire than bomb.
1584251	1587532	FireBama says their STDs suck, so be careful.
1588953	1589853	Don't get their herpes.
1591354	1592514	Yeah.
1593295	1593575	No.
1593775	1597097	That would suck if you could catch diseases from online games.
1597357	1597937	Oh, jeez.
1600138	1602979	I think online games are kind of a disease in general.
1603039	1603919	I mean, seriously.
1604400	1604920	There's got to be...
1605430	1611232	I bet if I went to a shrink and I told them how much I played Final Fantasy XI, she'd fucking slap me upside the head and say, GO OUTSIDE!
1611793	1615474	I'm gonna sue Final Fantasy XI and Square Enix for making me lazy.
1616154	1623877	But they have their disclaimer at the start of the game that says, you know, Don't forget your family and friends and work.
1624118	1627799	No, I didn't forget my family, friends, and work, but I'm sitting on my ass playing the game.
1628519	1632741	I acknowledge that they exist, however, you know.
1633920	1635261	I think about them all the time.
1635561	1637622	And I think about how much they don't love me.
1638622	1640883	Which is why I'm playing this goddamn game.
1641863	1644565	If I get killed by a goblin one more... Okay, I'll shut up.
1649046	1649607	Next!
1650187	1651047	Because I'm done.
1651607	1652588	Loki, how was your week?
1652628	1653148	How was your day?
1654949	1660071	Well... I don't even really remember what happened this week.
1661031	1662892	Not much of anything I'd imagine.
1663636	1677430	Um, let's see, well, today, I spent most of the day playing Final Fantasy, drinking milk and eating bacon bits, and, and, um, then what else did I do?
1677450	1686739	Oh yeah, I started charging my battery, but I found out that, wait, bacon bits, you just eat them right out of the, right out of the can, right?
1686759	1687160	Come here.
1688931	1690652	You just eat the bacon bits right out of the jar.
1690672	1692232	Yep, ate about half the container.
1692252	1693512	Can I put the jar on the webcam?
1693872	1695893	I don't know if the cam's actually up and running just yet.
1695953	1696493	I'll check on that first.
1696513	1699033	It looks up and running, but it might not be up and running on the website.
1699053	1700734	I have to make sure everything's running on the web end.
1701154	1701574	No, it's not.
1701854	1702514	I will set it up.
1702554	1705695	I'll set the webcam up, and I will go show the jar of bacon bits while you talk about your week here.
1707255	1709075	So anyways, yeah, I was eating those.
1709215	1715337	I don't know why, because I had this really crappy soup for lunch, and it just wasn't hitting the spot.
1715837	1717417	So bacon bits, it was, and
1717972	1746905	I don't know, it worked, so whatever, um, so then, also, um, what else happened this week, oh, my co-worker quit finally, and my other co-worker put in his notice, so, I'm all alone, and, um, what else did I do, oh, some other crap I worked on, the thing that pissed me off though is my battery, that cost me $200 is fucked up, and, so now I gotta return it, so, you know, hey,
1748988	1749408	What the hell?
1751309	1756550	Oh yeah, so then as I'm playing Final Fantasy and partying and eating bacon bits, I spill that crap all over the place.
1757330	1763932	So, you know, probably just something stuck in my... For the record, these are imitation bacon buds.
1765753	1767613	Whatever, it's the cheap shit, okay?
1769954	1770694	Don't be hatin'.
1771654	1772575	Nelly likes them too.
1774315	1776016	So anyways, and see you ate him?
1776376	1776876	You ate him too.
1778223	1779164	And I'm grimacing.
1779204	1780024	These are gross.
1780084	1781185	How can you... Ugh!
1781865	1782526	Oh, God!
1784407	1785487	Acquired taste, Robin.
1785547	1790370	And again, I'm also the same person who takes shots of, you know, maple syrup and eats rice.
1791191	1791551	Raw.
1792051	1792852	Without being cooked.
1794653	1797475	Oh, you also eat the top ramen just right out of the bag, uncooked, too.
1797515	1799216	That I can do, unfortunately.
1799396	1799896	Oh, God!
1800016	1800857	What is wrong with you people?
1801197	1801597	What?
1802278	1806200	I can do it, but, you know, I haven't... I haven't eaten it in a...
1807862	1809163	Okay, that I won't do.
1809823	1811204	Now my breast is going to smell like pork.
1812365	1815888	That bacon bit flavor is never going to leave your stomach.
1816888	1817929	That's one of the things about it.
1818489	1824794	Can't you just get some lettuce and some ranch dressing and then have yourself a salad and then put the bacon bits on the salad?
1825014	1826295	I fucking hate salad, dude.
1826415	1827515	Salad is nasty.
1828216	1828916	I'm sorry, man.
1828956	1833319	I cannot imagine eating grass or shrubbery or something like that.
1833699	1834380	That's just nasty.
1834440	1835140	Bunnies do it.
1835180	1835741	Why can't you?
1837110	1838932	Yeah, but bunnies poop like crazy.
1840653	1842435	I don't fucking take shits like that.
1846559	1846999	I give up.
1848881	1850022	So anyways, um...
1850868	1852349	So yeah, my week was filled with that.
1852489	1861537	And then I got to play... I'm part of the Matrix Online Stress Test 1, which I might say that I'm never going to buy that fucking game because it's lame.
1862038	1863319	It's so awful.
1863759	1867022	I mean, granted, it looks... Don't you have some type of non-disclosure agreement?
1867302	1870625	Oh yeah, I won't tell you why it sucks, but I'm going to tell you that it sucks.
1871146	1873548	No, really, it... I...
1874702	1875522	I like the game.
1875542	1876543	I mean, it's pretty.
1877203	1881865	And the idea, like, they have with, you know, the music where it's dynamic to what you're doing.
1881925	1883026	It changes and that kind of thing.
1883066	1883706	That's cool.
1884666	1886787	But I don't know what the fuck I'm doing at all.
1886927	1891189	I, like, got in there and I'm like, um, yeah.
1892010	1893330	And you just kind of run around.
1893370	1898332	The fighting system's awkward and just... Well, now, wait.
1898552	1899693	I signed no agreements.
1900071	1908198	and I happen to see a friend playing this game so I could express my comments because I'm not holding no agreement.
1908538	1909018	I don't care.
1909058	1911220	They can fucking sue my ass.
1911260	1912221	I don't really give a shit.
1912241	1914943	They ain't gonna get anything.
1914983	1917145	We already talked about how much you make.
1918546	1920107	You certainly don't get paid for this show.
1920848	1921508	Exactly.
1922709	1925872	So, um... Yeah, um...
1927423	1929104	Yeah, it's not that great.
1943175	1947698	It looks better than I thought it was going to be, and it also, the graphics are pretty good.
1948319	1952261	The amount of, like, ways you can customize your character is pretty cool.
1953302	1958085	But, like, I did about six or seven of the missions, and I was bored out of my mind.
1958185	1959366	I'd only gotten to level two.
1959426	1961567	I had no idea how to level up on anything.
1961627	1962768	Did you get to do any bullet time?
1963388	1963629	No.
1963809	1965150	See, that's what everybody wants.
1965190	1965990	They want bullet time.
1966030	1966611	They want it now.
1967371	1968652	But the thing is, it's like,
1969800	1971041	Well, actually, no, I take that back.
1971101	1973363	There was one move that I did, it's called Cheap Shot.
1973863	1977085	You kind of turn around and in bullet time you kick the guy in the nuts.
1977385	1977826	Cheap Shot 20.
1978546	1979547	So that was kind of cool.
1979567	1980007	Now you got me.
1980027	1985311	But, you know, other than that, it's just like I didn't really know how to, like, progress in the game.
1985331	1988273	Whereas Final Fantasy is pretty simple, you walk outside, kill shit.
1989273	1989914	Exactly.
1989934	1990674	You murder bunnies.
1990894	1995778	Like, I couldn't tell, exactly, I couldn't tell who was the NPCs, who were not the NPCs.
1996438	1997239	Who are the enemies?
1997319	1998100	Who could I fight?
1998420	1999661	What the hell the story was?
1999921	2001142	It's just, it was all confusing.
2001402	2003544	There was a tutorial that I did and I had to quit the game.
2003824	2006026	So then I couldn't go back to the tutorial again.
2006586	2012111	And it's just like, and then Morpheus drones on for about five minutes once you get in the game for the first time.
2012611	2015614	I'm just like, okay, I don't know what the hell's going on.
2016314	2016935	It was confusing.
2017455	2019317	So it was kind of like the second Matrix movie.
2020538	2023300	It's probably better than the second Matrix movie.
2026224	2026584	I don't know.
2026904	2027905	I'll probably play it again.
2027965	2029886	I don't really know when the stress test ends.
2029926	2031748	I think it's either this week or two weeks from now.
2031788	2032388	I'm not sure.
2033029	2036731	You know, I was actually watching TV last night and for some reason we have free HBO right now.
2036871	2040934	I'm not going to complain, but we have free HBO because I just by chance was channel surfing and I ended up on HBO.
2041314	2043116	And they were showing the second Matrix movie.
2044056	2047279	And so I started to watch it for like five minutes and I was like, I'm bored.
2047299	2047819	I'm going to bed.
2050961	2051221	Yeah.
2051762	2053583	And I love, I don't know, it's just just
2054676	2082130	whatever, try it if you want but don't I'd recommend probably Final Fantasy I don't know if that was my first online game or whatever to get into I'd probably be confused it'd probably turn me off to online games it's very good if you're like a first person shooter type person and you're getting into online games that'd be the way to go because the controls are that of a first person shooter and so you'd probably feel right at home with that
2082523	2086205	So like if you're a Quake, Doom, Halo nut, maybe.
2086765	2088026	Alright, sounds good.
2088726	2092628	I was going to say... Ah, forget it.
2093208	2094369	Oh yeah, I know what I was going to say.
2094469	2096389	I still want to give World of Warcraft a fair shot.
2096670	2106014	I got to observe World of Warcraft a little bit, and it seemed interesting, but I wasn't like wowed.
2107120	2107681	Pun intended.
2114880	2119203	Magus actually picked it up, so I've been watching him play it.
2119583	2120203	Does it look good?
2120643	2122164	Yeah, it looks good.
2122184	2123245	I mean, it's Blizzard.
2123645	2129608	But it was kind of funny, because he was killing stuff, and all of a sudden I hear Diablo 2 sounds, and I'm going, huh?
2129628	2131689	I turn around and I'm like, oh wait, Blizzard game.
2132930	2134411	So they just recycled the same effects.
2134431	2135051	Well, you know, whatever.
2135071	2137512	Kind of, sort of, yeah.
2137992	2142795	The characters don't look as pretty as Final Fantasy XI, because it's different, so...
2144504	2172056	about the only funny thing that I find actually amusing is like they can do like little dances and stuff no matter what you know depending on what race you choose that was hilarious like the what the dark undead guy can like rock out and stuff it's really funny you know what's interesting is the number one thing I hear about World of Warcraft is that they say it's more built for the casual player who wants to play by themself
2172506	2174166	and doesn't really want to party up a whole lot.
2174226	2181168	And my first reaction is, well, then why play a multiplayer massive online game if you want to play by yourself?
2183129	2184149	That's the part I don't get.
2184269	2186209	But other than that... Because here's why.
2186229	2192851	Because when you get down to Final Fantasy or whatever in the higher levels, if you don't find a party, you're stuck.
2192911	2195091	You're just sitting there for hours doing nothing.
2195652	2197292	And that's why.
2198615	2200435	People will get turned off by that kind of crap.
2200636	2204056	Because they don't, you know, obviously, you know, they could be doing thousands of others.
2204076	2205957	You can find things to do even when you're high level.
2205977	2216940	You can find things to do, but people want to be leveling up, and they can't do that by... Because you could do, you know, in Final Fantasy XI, you could do sin thing, you could do gardening, but, you know, people don't want to...
2225482	2225842	DarkSakura.com
2248540	2250721	Let's move on, and Explicit joined us.
2250781	2255144	He snuck in through the door while we were talking there a little bit ago.
2255204	2256104	So how you doing, Explicit?
2257825	2259986	Pretty okay for the whole week.
2260186	2262247	Well, I was going to ask, how was your week, how was your day, sir?
2262948	2274774	Well, this whole week's been hell, been pretty much hell, due to all of unnecessary drama that's been shoved in my face the whole week.
2276588	2278970	Special, like, right after the tournament, of course.
2279571	2281112	How did things go at the tournament, by the way?
2281372	2289820	Okay, like, during the tournament, it went very well, because, like, I mean, we had the speakers and had the microphones to talk to people and what they think about the tournament so far.
2291141	2292222	And it seems pretty fair.
2292242	2293703	I mean, a lot of people had fun and stuff.
2294684	2296525	But, of course, we always get the bad news.
2296806	2298647	Of course, we all know, drama.
2299848	2301149	Drama, drama revolution.
2301189	2302250	Where would we be without it?
2302470	2302931	Yeah.
2303539	2308845	Unfortunately, we get somebody who was bitching about, bitching the whole time.
2309946	2314051	I'm like, and trying to get into the faces of the people calculating the scores.
2314952	2317495	Okay, let us, first of all, let us do our jobs.
2318456	2319898	Don't come around bitching and bitching.
2320038	2322681	I understand you drove like three hours away from home.
2323291	2323371	Hmm.
2338506	2348055	Of course, you get people bitching about, some people bitching about the pad issues, which is, which is starting to be common in every tournament, since B3 maybe.
2348836	2354120	Where someone like, bitch about, oh, I got a great, we should do a doober because the arrow's not working.
2355962	2357003	No, the player's not working.
2358144	2358384	Obviously.
2359040	2365504	It happened in Sunnyvale Golf Land 3 numerous times where everyone had to play one pad because the left side is not working.
2365785	2367225	I heard you took my suggestion though.
2367286	2377252	I heard that you actually made them all sign a form that says the rules are final and pad disputes will be... I heard that you made everybody sign a form.
2377292	2377752	Yes, I did.
2377992	2378293	Good.
2378393	2378913	Good for you.
2379553	2384457	Unfortunately, some people went out of the barrier.
2384777	2385457	Look what happened.
2385497	2386298	They got kicked out.
2387644	2389306	The one person got kicked out of the tournament.
2389987	2392790	See this is what happens if you start drama.
2392830	2396313	Before the tournament you should have asked me questions personally and during the forums.
2396994	2400337	I'll see what I can do with the solution so it doesn't become a rush hour.
2401849	2407812	I think there should be a settlement process if there is reasonable doubt that the machine's malfunctioning.
2407852	2411194	But what that exactly is, does it take two people bitching?
2411234	2412695	Does it take whatever?
2412715	2415396	And then what's the process to review the machine?
2415436	2417117	You've got to set that all up in advance.
2417157	2418958	I think once a reasonable process is established...
2419912	2423134	There's really no way you can complain about it.
2423354	2429637	It's a little debatable because sometimes the techs are not there to help buy the parts.
2429677	2434460	You know, each arrow has four sensors itself.
2435400	2443805	And buying 32 parts in case one of them goes dead is not really a reasonable solution because you're spending a lot of money itself because you're going to owe the whole...
2444716	2446917	Like vendors, money, because they're spending parts on this.
2447937	2451658	So you're basically going to be left in a deficit like right after the whole tournament is over.
2453319	2463702	The sad thing is you could bring a brand new pad in there, brand spanking new pad, and somehow it's possible it could get fucked up during the tournament and it would not work.
2463923	2471265	So you just have to, I don't know, you just sometimes have to just bite the bullet and accept that things aren't always going to work perfectly at the tournament.
2471775	2477937	Yeah, I mean, I understand that, but, I mean, this is why, like, in my opinion, I'm not trying to say, like, it's, like, unacceptable, as some people might say.
2478717	2483758	Some people also have to check on player styles, like, sort of like freestyle in a way.
2483778	2488359	You have to figure out ways to make sure you get the perfects, rather than just try to cheat your way.
2488379	2491960	I mean, here's a question.
2492040	2492880	What would you rather have?
2493380	2497701	Someone who would accept defeat, or someone who would actually pitch too much so they can get a do-over in favor?
2498061	2499962	They're part of the tournament, so they can move up.
2500283	2504725	Someone who takes the defeat and takes the criticism on how to get better, of course.
2505427	2521739	Yeah, unfortunately, it comes to a point where, oh my god, like, here's an example, like, one of the rounds, I think, somebody got, the person, like, I'm not gonna say any names, the person got, like, 13 grades, and then he claims that he got 3 grades on that song.
2523480	2526783	Unfortunately, he said, oh my god, I got 10 grades on the same arrow.
2527724	2531306	We checked his playstyle, he's been getting the grades on the wrong arrow.
2534048	2534609	Interesting.
2535680	2537861	Yeah, and then of course you've got the rules.
2538902	2542264	Like I said before, they should have asked beforehand so we could come up with solutions.
2543145	2549809	I mean, Tony did it, or should I say Andrew, he was worried about putting suggestions about dark mode.
2550329	2553951	I added another option, which is one speed.
2554311	2554952	Right.
2555052	2555792	One of the two ways.
2556072	2556253	Right.
2556293	2556813	I'm not going to make it...
2557313	2558934	The tournament's more like an advanced format.
2558954	2562336	It's not really like the same traditional format like everyone thinks it is.
2563277	2568860	I'm thinking about using a traditional so people do... It'll cause less bitching for tournaments.
2569120	2571882	Or cancel singles PA overall.
2571922	2581568	Well, you know, you gotta just... It's one of those things where I think it gets to a point where if the rules are gonna be outside the box a little bit, then if you're a competitor, you gotta review the rules, and if it's not for you, don't enter.
2582408	2583629	Wait for the next tournament.
2583649	2586731	I mean, look... I'm not trying to blame...
2587130	2587490	DarkReverse
2609777	2621789	And the complaints were kind of minimal on it, because we outlined the rules in advance and said, here are the songs, and you'll have to do it dark or verse, and if you don't like it, don't enter.
2621809	2624631	The thing is, I released the songs during the tournament.
2625352	2630997	I said in the rules completely that the songs are going to be released during the tournament.
2631538	2634541	There are 16 songs to choose from, from easy to hard.
2635086	2640270	We did this really weird setup, and I wish I could find those rules again, because I think they're actually pretty good.
2640571	2652621	But it was like, you could choose a song from list A, B, or C, and B would keep your score even, A would reduce your score automatically by a little bit, because they were easier songs, and C would increase your score by a little bit, because they were like 9-footers and hard songs.
2652641	2653641	Yeah, I know that system.
2653682	2654943	You guys did a teeter system.
2655043	2655703	Yeah.
2655783	2658145	I mean, that was a system that worked very well.
2658486	2659807	I was thinking about using it for...
2660908	2661729	By pissing all over it.
2679568	2699860	and of course you see TOs quitting tournaments because of it because they can't handle the situation and this is where I came in and take some numerous action eliminating the pests alright well anything else in your week outside the tournament how else was your week and stuff
2701277	2703899	Okay, I'll explain some more of the tournament later, like probably my FUs.
2703999	2704240	Okay.
2704800	2705741	Well, it's been hell.
2706602	2713267	And, oh yeah, of course, everyone knows about Ash Wednesday, where they had to sacrifice something for 40 days and 40 nights.
2713587	2714148	Oh yeah, Lent.
2714388	2715129	Okay.
2715329	2715809	I got a question.
2715829	2717691	Did anybody sacrifice anything for Lent?
2718572	2720133	I sacrificed going to church.
2721014	2721354	Wow.
2722415	2722955	Wow.
2727354	2731616	And all due respect, it's not my cup of tea for that stuff.
2731716	2735178	So no, I don't celebrate Lent.
2736558	2737179	What'd you give up?
2738099	2743862	It's pretty ashamed to say on Orange Lounge Radio, but I'll say it right now.
2743982	2744202	What?
2744422	2746643	I sacrificed getting a boner for Lent.
2747403	2748424	Wait, wait, wait.
2748484	2750405	You sacrificed getting a boner.
2750885	2752866	You're not allowed to get a boner for the next 40 days.
2752886	2753106	Yes.
2756616	2758998	I sacrifice masturbating with my left hand.
2759398	2761620	It's strictly right hand from now on.
2762260	2763501	Wait, wait, wait.
2763541	2766563	What are you going to do if that hot Asian girl with big boobs walks by?
2766603	2769885	Are you just going to look the other way real quick before dirty thoughts?
2769985	2770586	I've found ways.
2770606	2777290	I'm drinking a lot of water to gulp down and... It's a tough decision.
2777350	2780532	It's basically a land that no man has gone before.
2780552	2780752	Wait...
2781926	2783127	You gotta tape it down.
2783988	2789232	That's what you're gonna have to do, is you're going to have to tuck your penis back and make yourself have a vagina.
2789272	2791994	That's the only way you're gonna stop getting a boner all together.
2792054	2793855	Oh boy, he really wants one of those!
2793955	2796758	Even that is not, you know, foolproof either, I mean.
2798719	2805965	That is like, I'd like to compare it to like the octopus, you know, where you have multiple brains, you know, octopuses, octopi have...
2806798	2812663	multiple brains, they have brains that control their feet, or their tentacles, or whatever, and, you know, their normal brain.
2813843	2819748	I'm sorry, but once that signal, once you see, once Hot Girl's signal has gone down to their brain, it's all over.
2819828	2823891	What are you going to do if you wake up in the morning, and then you're like, Oh, fuck!
2824852	2825693	God hates me!
2825813	2826473	What are you going to do?
2827174	2828315	So, wait, here's the thing.
2828355	2829856	So far, I've actually survived.
2830276	2831477	I'm not going to need a boner.
2832078	2833779	I've seen attractive women, but no boner.
2835484	2837145	and I woke up, no boner.
2837505	2838826	I took a piss, no boner.
2842287	2843688	Does like a semi count?
2845009	2847790	And here's the thing, no, I'm not taking any anti-viagra.
2850271	2850792	Wow.
2851212	2851772	Wow.
2852333	2857855	So yes, it's a challenge, but I'm living up to my word, no boner for the next 40 days.
2858175	2860277	I hate to say it, but keep us posted.
2861317	2862057	It's on my LJ.
2862958	2863378	Alright.
2864158	2865099	For those who want to check out
2866217	2875323	You know if he comes back here on day 39, I'm going to have like the rotating, you know, big-titted Asian prawn hentai, everything going on the screen in here.
2875443	2879186	I should have like a sign that says, you know, gone this many days without wood.
2882768	2883189	Wow.
2884790	2885230	Amazing.
2888752	2889093	Alright.
2890273	2890634	My way...
2895615	2900257	I could take that down the gutter even further, but for the sake of humanity, I'm not going to.
2901177	2901978	Good luck, my friend.
2902018	2902358	Good luck.
2902458	2903098	That's all I have to say.
2903118	2903458	Oh, come on, man.
2903498	2904519	We need time to kill.
2905059	2905599	No, it's all right.
2905639	2905999	It's all right.
2906339	2906719	Trust me.
2906899	2907640	You don't want me to go there.
2911761	2914242	Sorry, I'm having a comedy show in my mind.
2914282	2915943	This is why we'll never make it.
2916543	2917023	Seriously.
2921471	2923515	The folks from Satellite Radio are listening right now.
2923615	2930026	Oh, we just found out about this program that's all about gaming and these people here are all into gaming and they've done it for years.
2930046	2930868	They've got to be good at this.
2931389	2932090	Now they're tuning in.
2933007	2934828	You're going to get a boner in 40 days.
2934848	2936528	You can't go 40 days without a boner.
2936728	2938669	We're going to put big-titted women on the screen.
2938909	2951634	To tell you how much G4 has sold out to just, you know, selling everything with sex on their damn station, because that's, I guess, the only way they think it's going to work, they're going to have some football game coverage featuring the Lingerie Bowl girls.
2953455	2954395	Oh, yeah, that's game-related.
2955176	2955436	Oh, yeah.
2958317	2960298	Is that the tech TV part of the station?
2960518	2960538	I...
2962546	2962786	Anyway.
2963447	2964888	No, no, see, you forget.
2965008	2967090	Tech TV's no longer part of the station.
2967250	2968371	Oh, my bad, my bad.
2969733	2970053	Anyway.
2971969	2974211	My week and my day, since we didn't get around to it yet.
2974691	2976053	My week and my day were pretty good.
2976633	2980256	I went out to the clubs last night, you know, shaking my thing.
2980296	2983159	And it's so hilarious when you hear DDR songs at the club.
2983659	2989925	I know I'm such a loser for thinking that, but you know, we were dancing in the room where all the videos come on.
2990205	2992928	And they played shiny disco balls, you know, from Ultramix.
2994309	2998913	And I just... To illusion in the chat room, we call those weekdays.
3014191	3020055	Loki should have a spin-off show where he feels on big-breasted Asian girls and shouts racial slurs for two straight hours.
3020696	3021757	I call those weekdays.
3022817	3023578	Alright, alright.
3024018	3025199	I'm sorry, Explosive, you were saying?
3025719	3029342	Speaking of that, guess what I heard on 24 Hour Fitness when I was working out?
3030512	3031793	Someone actually played... Butterfly.
3032013	3032193	No.
3033174	3033995	Era from TAC.
3034695	3034995	What?
3035396	3036136	I'm serious.
3036456	3040699	I was working out with the weights, and I heard Era.
3040719	3042981	I'm like, what the fuck?
3044482	3046263	On like the 24... What do they have in there?
3046283	3048925	Like a 24-hour fitness radio station or music?
3048945	3049766	No, they play it regular.
3049786	3054429	They play any songs that people put in their music box and play it all.
3054790	3059273	They play like some of the stuff from DDR Max, like Sandstorm or...
3060828	3064489	I know that Jamie had burned a CD for her spin group.
3064629	3065850	They do the bike spin thing.
3066350	3068010	But I don't know how many Bomani Shants she put on.
3068030	3070191	I think it was mostly like top 40 junk.
3070531	3073732	And this was funny to burn one of these CDs for Jamie to have to make her, you know.
3073932	3075513	But they had to get something that was friendly to everybody.
3075533	3080774	She's like, and of course she comes to me, Rob, do you have Toxic by Britney?
3080794	3083555	Oh, wait a minute, wait a minute.
3083575	3083995	What, what?
3084376	3085456	I see a comment about...
3087883	3088503	laugh out loud.
3088543	3091605	It's even more crazy to see someone doing DDR steps in clubs.
3091645	3092626	I was just getting to that.
3092686	3098730	When Shiny Disco Balls came on, I was kind of like dancing like, disco, disco, disco, like doing the little steps.
3098750	3116083	Speaking of that, speaking of that, okay, this is, speaking of, speaking relating to the tournament, I know it's over, but I found out the reason why someone wanted to win first place was to take this girl to this junior prom and to realize, I would, I would imagine if he does DDR in a freaking prom.
3117119	3117900	Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
3118560	3122543	Some guy wanted to win the tournament because if he won the tournament... Like money and stuff?
3123404	3124004	Oh, okay.
3124044	3126626	I thought the girl wouldn't date him unless he won the tournament type thing.
3126646	3127487	I know the girl, too.
3127807	3129428	Oh, okay.
3129448	3135433	That's a really bad setup for like DDR Freak the movie, you know, like... Never mind.
3135753	3137374	Yeah, you know, this is ridiculous.
3137414	3139476	It's very sad, but true.
3139496	3139576	True.
3141616	3146458	You basically have to rip off the whole storyline for 10K Commotion.
3146758	3149339	I'm not having another DDR Freak movie discussion.
3150419	3151920	I'm not having it again on the show.
3151940	3153701	You should be 10K Commotion the movie.
3153741	3155041	That would be the only way it would work.
3155581	3155981	Only way.
3156482	3157142	No other way.
3157442	3161423	None of this robot chick Asian person dancer.
3161904	3162084	No.
3162584	3163544	Can I talk about my week?
3164945	3165305	I guess.
3165405	3165685	All right.
3166331	3191769	So, Friday night I was hanging out with some friends and we went over to Rice Princess' house, you know, the one from Outside the Box, although we haven't really done Outside the Box in several weeks, which I apologize for, but, you know, there's just been other circumstances coming up and the show may be moved or retooled in the near future, so I appreciate those of you guys who are bearing with us, but we just have a lot of other crap that's been getting in the way, so something might change with that.
3191849	3194291	Anyway, but as far as
3194711	3195631	Friday nights go.
3195872	3202214	I saw, for the very first time in my life, and I know this is hard to believe, I had never seen The Fifth Element before, the movie.
3202514	3203555	I finally saw it Friday night.
3205256	3208577	It was very gay, really.
3210398	3211919	Like the costumes and everything.
3212559	3214020	No, I don't know how to describe it.
3214200	3215340	It was alright, I guess.
3215660	3221563	Although, the thing I thought was kind of cool about The Fifth Element was that it was kind of like a video game plot.
3222143	3222703	It really was.
3222763	3224164	It was a total video game plot.
3225916	3228398	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3246044	3247706	We're going to look at the other half now.
3247766	3251970	We did some, you know, happy, lovey-dovey songs in the first break.
3252030	3256414	Now we're going to do some angry songs for Singles Awareness Day.
3256714	3257495	Some anger.
3258415	3261318	Speaking of Valentine's Day as well, coming up.
3261939	3262179	What?
3262639	3263200	A quick thought?
3263660	3263921	Yeah?
3264241	3265502	Are you doing anything for Valentine's Day?
3265782	3267124	Unfortunately, no.
3267284	3268925	It's a good thing, or else you might get a boner.
3269846	3270747	Oh, yeah, that's true.
3271468	3271928	That is true.
3272358	3278343	Oh wait, wait, actually no, that'll make it worse because I gotta work after school and... Yeah.
3278803	3279144	Alright.
3279224	3280705	Deal with people smooching.
3282747	3285589	Each and every time.
3285669	3287050	The desire is increasing.
3288011	3289633	Alright, we'll be back after this.
3289653	3296218	We're gonna start it off with an angry Korean, and then we'll be back with more Orange Launch Radio, including some actual Vimani news, believe it or not.
3296238	3299461	There's quite a little bit going on this week, so we're gonna talk about that when we come back after this.
3395212	3396153	Thank you for watching!
3492612	3493152	and many more.
3520430	3521430	Thank you for watching!
3547168	3548349	Yeah, yeah, yeah
3569284	3570786	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3691058	3699603	Hiho, Kermit the Frog here, informing you that today's broadcast of Orange Lounge Radio is brought to you by the letter B, the letter A, and the number 59.
3699643	3705466	Can you tell me how to get, how to get to Sesame Street?
3705826	3709409	We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 131.
3710969	3717033	A happy early Valentine's Day to all of you people out there, or Singles Awareness Day, whatever the case may be for you.
3718280	3720542	As promised, we're going to talk about some Bavani news right now.
3720622	3723784	Big news, Dancing Stage Unleashed 2.
3724464	3726726	At least if you're in Europe, this will be big news to you.
3726806	3729208	For everybody else, not so big a news.
3729268	3731269	But at least there's a new DDR game on the way.
3731870	3732310	What do you know?
3733911	3735993	A few tracks have already been announced for this game.
3736033	3736573	Pretty cool.
3736953	3738855	Basement Jax, where's your head at?
3739675	3745980	Girls Aloud, Love Machine, Happy Mondays, Step On, Supergrass, Alright.
3746556	3752277	Donna Summer, Hot Stuff, The Jam, A Town Called Malice.
3752958	3756058	All of them supposedly supposed to have the background videos to them as well.
3756959	3757779	Very interesting.
3757919	3758799	Also, you know what else?
3759379	3766341	Basically, by the way, for those who don't know, Dancing Stage Unleashed, it's basically going to be their version of Ultramix 2.
3767441	3768682	So, they're getting that.
3769322	3774203	What's very interesting about this, though, the rumor is that you're going to be able to play this on Xbox Live.
3774733	3779576	You'll be able to play against people in the US if you're in Canada.
3780116	3783939	But only on those songs that the two games share.
3785220	3789582	So that should be interesting though, is that now you can settle the score with any of your buddies that live in Europe.
3789942	3791924	You can actually play on Xbox Live against them.
3792744	3793985	Loki, your thoughts on Unleashed 2?
3796106	3797027	Really just nothing new.
3797797	3802639	as far as gameplay features other than the online thing.
3804640	3816306	I'm interested to see, though, because you know how Ultramix 2, they had their deal with a different drum, what they're going to do as far as the extra music for this game.
3816366	3820448	I wonder if they're going to team up with maybe a UK label or something like that.
3820708	3824510	That would be what I'm waiting for to see what's going to happen there.
3828450	3832054	Any thoughts on Unleashed 2 from Angel or Explicit?
3835057	3835818	Sounds pretty cool.
3836158	3843345	I mean, there's a couple songs that they always get that we don't, that I wish that we had, but, you know, I can keep wishing, whatever.
3844887	3847950	I know, it seems like Europe always gets these awesome licenses, don't they?
3848591	3848731	Yeah.
3848751	3850833	Basie and Jax is awesome, and they're getting, oh man.
3851428	3851668	See?
3851848	3852629	Now you're bummed too.
3852809	3853370	I know.
3853470	3854010	A little bit.
3854450	3855151	I want them all.
3855211	3855771	I want all those.
3856092	3858193	I'm tempted to get a Europe PS2 at this point.
3858253	3859574	Although this is going to be for Xbox.
3859955	3862417	I still want a Europe PS2 just to get all the games.
3862937	3865979	But of course then I'd have to get the converter so the TV would show it.
3866420	3867681	It's just not worth it that much.
3867801	3868181	I don't know.
3869182	3869602	Exquisite?
3870123	3870483	Your thoughts?
3870703	3875407	Well, I'm thinking it's the same songs and different steps.
3875687	3876748	New songs and new steps.
3876788	3878449	That's basically what I'm hearing so far.
3878469	3880671	We got the Xbox Lite like I stated earlier.
3881926	3882846	Good thought.
3882866	3885288	I would be interested to know if they're going to get the song packs as well.
3885308	3885608	Who knows?
3885628	3889429	Because that would be a whole lot of songs that you could play, you know, against.
3889449	3890670	Because how many songs is it going to share with...
3911195	3911656	Ultramix 2.
3912036	3912436	I don't know.
3912516	3912916	Probably.
3913357	3917419	I mean, I guess you can probably bet that most of the Konami originals are going to carry over.
3917459	3919480	Things like, I don't know, Zero One, Root 80s.
3919520	3921202	The staple songs that everybody wants.
3921362	3922142	But, I don't know.
3922162	3922903	Will they all?
3922983	3923463	Who knows?
3923663	3924203	We don't know yet.
3924363	3926265	So, we shall see.
3927425	3928746	But then we always have Step Mania.
3929967	3933189	But then we always have Step Mania in case we don't get the songs.
3934049	3938372	Like Ultramix 3 or Extreme 2 or even with DDR with Mario.
3939329	3943312	You know, I'm just looking forward to getting to kick some British ass on Xbox Live, actually.
3943412	3944713	No, I'm kidding.
3945493	3946634	I'm going to get hate mail from that one.
3947114	3951858	Actually, I can't wait to start hearing some of those sexy, sexy accents through the speaker.
3953299	3953819	Name some.
3954299	3957422	You know the, hello, I hope you're having a good day.
3958663	3960524	Would you like to do some DD on, then have some tea?
3960544	3963586	Of course.
3965451	3968534	I'm getting so much hate mail from anybody that's listening to this in Europe right now.
3968574	3969575	I'm just joking.
3970235	3971276	Okay, I'm in California.
3971356	3974198	Haha, we all have blonde hair and blue eyes and go surfing, huh?
3974879	3975539	What?
3978541	3982525	Oh, that could be interesting because you might be playing people in other countries.
3982685	3983285	Is that possible?
3984086	3986768	Do they sell the stuff outside of...
3987538	3989579	Thank you for watching, and I'll see you next time.
4011829	4014150	We can speak the universal language of kickin' ass!
4014751	4018713	Oh, get it up.
4019153	4022095	Did I tell you about the last time I beat an Asian on DDR?
4024036	4024496	Wait, what?
4024756	4026137	Even though that was a long-ass time ago?
4026157	4026918	What was this, Angel?
4026958	4027178	What?
4028859	4032521	Oh, I actually beat an Asian playing DDR6 Mix.
4033604	4034224	How old was she?
4034304	4034584	Six?
4035744	4037365	I'm just kidding.
4039345	4040806	He was like 19 or something.
4042806	4048167	He didn't believe that there was actually American people playing DDR and all that stuff.
4049287	4050548	It was kind of funny.
4052628	4053148	That's cool.
4054288	4055849	It was in the middle of Japan.
4055929	4056509	We know this.
4057523	4058684	This was like two years ago.
4058724	4065087	And it's so funny because, you know, some folks make the assumption that instantly, oh, we're all going to get killed by the Japanese on DDR if this happens.
4065527	4066227	But you know what?
4066567	4070549	Just like they're shitty American players, they're shitty Japanese players, you know?
4070869	4074571	Everybody's new to DDR at some point, so, you know, you've got to start somewhere.
4074711	4079654	Until you watch some Japanese girl walk up to the TDX machine and just completely own everyone else.
4080274	4080834	That was insane.
4081275	4081575	Okay.
4083536	4085897	Anyways, you've got people saying, yo, kero DDR.
4087313	4088073	Oh my god.
4089734	4090394	Just stop.
4090594	4091775	Seriously, stop.
4096717	4097637	More news going on.
4097737	4101599	Actually, I don't know if you guys noticed, but DDR Freak had a whole lot of news this week.
4101639	4103579	I'm sure a lot of you guys are watching DDR Freak.
4103920	4108581	And we, of course, have to show a little love to DDR Freak because they replay us on their Friday nights on DDR Freak Radio.
4109722	4110162	Kisses.
4111255	4112397	So they have a lot of stuff.
4112778	4117086	And really what I've noticed this week is a whole lot of looking for people.
4117427	4118408	They're looking for people.
4118428	4119290	There's all sorts of stuff.
4119470	4121154	It's like casting calls left and right.
4121194	4122115	They're looking for people.
4122175	4122757	It's interesting.
4124201	4131148	Speaking of Yokiro DDR, a Spanish language network was looking for a Spanish-speaking DDR player.
4131448	4132529	We don't know what's going on.
4132609	4134071	I don't know what ended up happening with that.
4134271	4136733	I didn't end up reading the comments, but they were looking for somebody.
4138395	4146883	First for Women magazine was looking for a mother who lost weight playing DDR with their kid, which I think, you know what, I think that's kind of neat.
4147183	4147724	That's kind of cool.
4148376	4152382	I know my mom wouldn't even know how to turn on a PlayStation, let alone get up and play DDR.
4152402	4154084	Cool mommies, not mine.
4159119	4161500	And this is a call that everybody could participate on.
4161540	4163380	This is what I thought was really cool.
4163600	4166541	DDR Freak was helping out the Make-A-Wish Foundation of Indiana.
4166601	4168681	They were helping this child's dream come true.
4169662	4175843	This child, Robbie, has a kidney disease, and his wish was for a game room in his home featuring DDR.
4176203	4182265	So they just rallied the troops together to buy him just the supremo setup for DDR.
4182285	4182945	So that's kind of cool.
4183205	4184465	If you're interested in that, check it out.
4184545	4186846	It's the February 10th headline over on DDRFreak.com.
4187774	4188955	is certainly worth participating in.
4189496	4198543	And Red Octane, this was just announced recently, Red Octane's going to be doing a focus group in Sunnyvale this Friday and next Friday.
4199064	4206070	And I guess if you participate, which, by the way, is at 7 o'clock, you have to have your own transportation to Sunnyvale, so if you're on the East Coast, sorry, you're screwed.
4206090	4209433	But if you're somewhere in the Bay Area, Red Octane will provide dinner.
4210594	4211454	I wonder what kind of dinner.
4211474	4213276	All right.
4214819	4217581	Maybe I should write and inquire, are we going to get Black Angus?
4217661	4219222	Or are you going to get, like, you know, McD's?
4219242	4222725	It's Friday, February 18th and Friday, February 25th at 7 o'clock.
4222745	4223205	You know what?
4223245	4226188	What's funny is I'm actually tempted to sign up for it.
4226208	4226708	I'm so damn curious.
4226748	4226868	I just...
4243422	4243943	RedOctane GotSkill
4261756	4263277	I wish I could go, but I can't.
4263917	4271441	Plus, people say it's a bad idea to even go anyways because, you know, some people will still get heated up with drama from the last tournament.
4271561	4272341	It's just stupid.
4273002	4273762	People should grow.
4273802	4277924	I mean, I don't want that, which is the reason why I won't be going as well.
4278965	4281066	So I'll let people take care of their business there.
4282492	4285033	You're a bitter, bitter man after some of these tournaments, aren't you?
4285473	4290596	No, because I'm always bitter to those who can't accept defeat or think they're 100% correct.
4291236	4293917	When they're obviously not, they can't admit their own mistakes.
4295698	4297899	Instead of trying to get better, they just whine.
4298359	4300560	So, I'm just going to leave it as is.
4301260	4303021	Some of the competitors I know are going to go there.
4303801	4304802	Some of the Sacktown people...
4306304	4309828	Team Piss or There's actually a Team Piss now?
4309968	4322545	No, just Team PI Some people call it the Paradise Island Sacktown Squad but it's just called Team PI Not Team Piss Interesting No more piss jokes now I'm trying
4323482	4341593	Alright, if you guys are interested in the Red Octane Focus group, you can check that out on www.ddrfreak.com I'm sure there will be non-disclosure agreements involved, so even if we do get to check it out, if I do decide I want to put in and I get picked, I probably won't be able to talk about it, but, you know, it'll be still kind of neat to see.
4341913	4342513	So, we'll see.
4343394	4343874	We will see.
4344935	4345355	Moving on.
4346836	4347636	This is big news.
4347696	4348257	This is huge.
4348857	4349558	This is huge news.
4349678	4350118	How huge?
4350838	4351158	Huge.
4351339	4351899	Bigger than big.
4354946	4356687	I was supposed to release Exceed 2, not just Exceed.
4372820	4373661	Well, here it is.
4373921	4377526	This is the press release straight from InsertCredit.com.
4378167	4385918	Mastiff has announced that it will be publishing Animero's Pump It Up Exceed for PlayStation 2 and Xbox in North America in June.
4386976	4395481	They made the announcement at the Metreon, and we had an Ace Pump It Up player named Smidget there, and they were strutting their stuff on an arcade in a home version of the Dance Mat game.
4395902	4404447	The Pump It Up franchise, according to this press release, has sold over a quarter million copies of the arcade versions and PC versions thus far.
4405336	4406917	Now you'll notice they don't say what country.
4407817	4411079	I know, but I already know what countries have been selling Pump It Up pretty well.
4411599	4416042	I imagine the PC version isn't doing too badly, but probably not so much in this country.
4416422	4420024	Although, you know, Red Octane has it in their store, and I imagine a lot of people pick it up through there.
4420044	4421144	Here's the thing, though.
4421565	4429829	Let's see, Pump It Up is more international than DDR, because I know Pump It Up is mainly supported in Mexico and mainly South America as well.
4429869	4430049	Right.
4430549	4433571	Because America, mainly DDR, overpopulated the whole...
4434457	4436898	You got your Pump fans, though.
4436938	4439519	I mean, overall, compared to other countries.
4439579	4441860	I know Mexico populizes Pump It Up.
4443140	4445301	Argentina, Chile, or anywhere in South America.
4445401	4446502	Yeah, I've heard the same thing.
4446542	4452724	A lot of South American countries are really big on Pump It Up, as well as a lot of the countries in the East that aren't Japan or China.
4452804	4455225	A lot of those other countries... Korea.
4455245	4457106	Yeah, definitely.
4457246	4460067	I'm not sure what other places support Pump It Up as well.
4461064	4475034	It should be noted, this is not going to be the exact same as the Korean PS2 version that was just launched, because there's going to be some exclusive songs, including a song by Stereogram called Walkie Talkie Man, and it's going to have the actual video that runs in the background.
4475074	4477856	For those of you guys who haven't seen it, it's like a claymation video.
4477876	4478977	It's kind of a rock song.
4479318	4480879	It's not your typical dance song.
4480939	4482740	It's kind of more of a rockish song.
4483060	4488204	But then again, a lot of the Korean songs in Pump It Up were kind of rock songs, so...
4489113	4489793	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
4519654	4520494	I don't know how they do it.
4520554	4533758	If you could do autoplay on the middle, which wouldn't really be the game then, there's really no way to get these third-party pads to work unless the third-party pad has all the buttons, I don't know, is a nine-square pad or something.
4534298	4536319	The lack of a center button is really going to screw things up.
4536479	4537839	Loki?
4537899	4541280	There are the, oh, what pads are those?
4541360	4547022	There are the, I want to say Cobalt Flux pads do have the center button.
4548712	4551294	Those will be able to be used, but those are high-end ones.
4552375	4557319	As nice of a pad as Cobalt Flux is, how popular is it really?
4557660	4560602	It's not the kind of thing you walk into GameStop and purchase, right?
4561083	4563946	I had a hard enough time finding an Ignition 2.0 locally.
4564266	4570752	And even when I bought an Ignition 2.0, I spent $100 on DancePad, they were like, we've never sold one of these before.
4570812	4572193	You're actually going to buy this?
4572774	4574075	What the fuck is wrong with you?
4575458	4577343	And I was just kind of like, it's a good pad.
4577603	4580751	I don't want to spend $20 on the cheap pad that's going to break next week.
4581243	4582284	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4606306	4610589	Granted, it might be a little bit... It's really not the same dance style though.
4610849	4611249	It's really not.
4634003	4635884	I think Pump It Up is easier to freestyle to.
4636004	4642988	I think a lot of the songs you automatically, like your body's in a motion where you're... Yeah, because you're given a lot of room on freestyle itself in Pump It Up.
4643088	4645550	And like I said, it's a real different type of music too.
4646791	4649052	That's my problem with it, and this is the big one.
4649913	4653455	How the fuck are you going to be able to play those extreme and crazy songs?
4654075	4654796	That is true!
4656054	4658356	There's one song that's impossible to even beat.
4658436	4662858	There's where they have the four or five button mashing.
4662878	4666220	I mean, it's just not fun.
4666280	4674666	That's my main complaint about Pump It Up at the beginning is those crazy songs where you have to do knee drops and shit.
4674866	4675326	No thanks.
4676940	4679122	In The Groove is not DDR Unless it's convenient for it to be DDR
4705057	4709618	because whenever people bitch about a lack of DDR, then they go, oh, well, there's always In The Groove.
4710138	4712439	I thought you just said In The Groove wasn't DDR.
4714039	4715120	That's my number one complaint.
4715640	4716000	Same here.
4716020	4717180	I mean, some people are confused.
4717200	4718640	They're basically two different games.
4718660	4721661	They have different timing, different music, different options.
4722541	4724522	I mean, it's all different.
4724862	4726302	Some people say they're trying to compare.
4726322	4729003	It's like, ooh, In The Groove is DDR 9th mix.
4730563	4730823	No.
4732044	4733224	No, I wouldn't go that far.
4734679	4734779	Pump
4756718	4757739	Pump it up, yeah.
4779441	4788024	You and I, you being the Bomani addict, because you're actually taking time to tune in and listen to this show, you and I understand the differences between DDR and Pump It Up.
4788885	4796368	But the casual gamer, a parent who walks into a GameStop buying the stuff for their kid, are they going to really understand the difference?
4796768	4796928	No.
4796968	4801510	And the people who are supplying this, I think a lot of people are going to view it as a cheap knockoff of DDR.
4802290	4803070	Yeah, obviously.
4803190	4805371	I think that's the way the casual gamer is going to look at it.
4805751	4807872	Now, but here's the thing, if the price is right...
4808433	4809254	That could help it.
4810094	4812597	You know, somebody wants to get into the dance thing.
4813457	4819542	According to how they view, that's just like, just because Pump It has a stepping arrow does not mean it's a rip-off of DDR.
4819582	4828289	Look at other games like, that's just like saying, ooh, there's a lot of Mario knock-offs, or there's a lot of Doom knock-offs, and et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.
4828310	4829991	I can keep going on and on about that.
4830542	4835086	Here's the thing, again, again, you're talking about the casual gamer versus the addict, the dance game addict.
4835106	4838528	The casual gamer, you can see that a game is not Mario.
4838608	4840430	You can see that this game is not Mario.
4841050	4845153	But you see that this is another dance game with arrows that scroll up to the top of the screen that you hit them.
4845994	4847175	You and I understand the difference.
4847836	4848416	Most people don't.
4849682	4850583	Sadly, that's true.
4852064	4852685	Unfortunately.
4852705	4861051	Because so many people are so narrow-minded to judge from their first impressions without getting a chance to look deeply what the game is all about.
4862052	4870259	It's like, ooh, they say, ooh, Resident Evil, or anything they see is popular, they're going to buy it, regardless if the game is either good or bad.
4870499	4872581	You just look from their eyes.
4875742	4885005	I think the price has a lot to do with it.
4885785	4890247	I'd be very curious to know how that little Mad Catz game is selling right now.
4890287	4893208	That shitty little Mad Catz GameCube game, the dance game.
4893268	4896029	I'd be very curious to know how that's doing right now.
4896049	4899670	I don't think it's doing too hot, but I'd be very curious to know.
4900878	4903339	From my source, I think it's not doing good at all.
4904100	4905620	Considering that some people actually played it.
4905660	4908821	It just feels unnatural.
4908841	4912703	But again, the people that you're talking to are DDR and Bomani addicts.
4912743	4913383	I'm not talking about DDR.
4913403	4915324	I'm talking about casual gamers.
4915784	4917365	Not just DDR addicts and stuff.
4918325	4919966	Not the people we know in the community.
4920166	4922007	Just regular casual gamers.
4922527	4926449	I'd just be curious to know.
4926829	4927569	But that's the thing.
4928469	4929590	This is my other concern.
4930623	4934726	What if that game, heaven forbid, is somebody's first exposure to a dance game?
4935506	4937067	Then they'd never want to play DDR.
4937668	4940730	They'd be all, oh, I played one of those dancing games once, it was stupid.
4943792	4949115	Yeah, like I said, something that comes first will always get the fish, and people are just going to buy that.
4949495	4954559	I think that's where, and when a lot of folks say, I'm kind of going on a little tangent here, but I don't care.
4954599	4959302	When a lot of folks say, and back to the in the groove, not being DDR, again...
4959946	4960446	Yeah, unfortunately.
4960466	4961246	So, something to think about.
4990883	4991964	That's how I view sports games.
4992004	4992724	Madden, Blitz...
5018339	5019540	They're all football games to me.
5020901	5022962	They're interchangeable parts to me.
5023182	5024342	A football game is a football game.
5024722	5030785	But if I were the sports guy, I would be saying, Oh, Sky, you're an ignorant motherfucker.
5030845	5033006	These games are all different.
5033306	5037529	This game's got this license, and this game you can play in the street.
5038689	5041550	But to me, the football games, they're all the same.
5041590	5042591	I played one, I played them all.
5045091	5046152	Okay, that's true.
5046212	5053539	Maybe I'm just being a little too critical with what I think about certain games, especially when I've played practically almost every game there is.
5054700	5058123	Mainly because I go to a friend of mine who keeps running games and I play them.
5060209	5062150	Alright, we're going to take a break, you guys.
5062370	5065052	We're going to take a break, and then when we come back, we're going to open up the Skype line.
5065452	5068133	We want to hear from some of you guys, some comments after this break.
5068213	5072335	I want to talk about Loki's little work of art he's completed this week.
5072355	5074256	Some of you guys have heard about this.
5074276	5075057	Yeah, it's right there.
5075097	5075477	Look at that.
5075877	5076477	Isn't that crazy?
5077538	5079839	Yeah, we'll talk about that when we come back from the break.
5079859	5080539	We're going to talk about all that.
5080559	5082621	We're going to open up the Skype line, and we're going to have ourselves a cage match.
5082661	5083421	Believe it or not...
5084291	5085692	We're kind of running long right now.
5085712	5087832	We're actually behind schedule.
5087872	5090013	We should have been in the cage match already, so this is going to be interesting.
5090353	5091193	I know, it's weird.
5091993	5095294	I totally thought... I was like, shit, it's going to be a short show tonight.
5095314	5096395	We've got nothing to talk about.
5096895	5099076	Luckily, there's been a lot of news that's helped us keep going.
5099716	5101156	We'll talk about all this stuff when we come back.
5101236	5105157	In this break, another type of love song for your Valentine's Day.
5105798	5106278	We'll be back.
5108908	5122015	Oh, do it all night, do it with me I'll take you to heaven if you make me feel free, babe Do it tonight, do it all right Just take me and shake me till I burn up inside
5152728	5153492	Thank you for watching!
5193166	5194424	Come on, do it with me.
5232431	5233014	Thanks for watching!
5327354	5338924	I open my eyes and everything's still the same I turn to the guy who was dead last night I'm asking, what's your name?
5374716	5376000	Thanks for watching!
5420925	5421906	and many more.
5473860	5474880	Thanks for watching!
5500223	5501464	Orange Lounge Radio.
5501804	5503966	We put your thing down, flip it, and reverse it.
5509689	5511591	You know, they played that song at the club last night, too.
5512471	5514252	Gotta beat, better work it.
5514473	5515093	I love that song.
5515333	5515633	Love it.
5516454	5522338	Anyway, in that break you heard some songs there, a different type of Valentine's Day for you.
5522778	5528642	Do It All Night, Injection of Love, So Many Men, and Jack and Mark Get Busy.
5529178	5529478	Get it?
5529798	5530299	Jack and Mark?
5530319	5530939	Yeah, alright.
5532000	5536883	Even though the song really has nothing... Anyway, I just think it's got a funny title.
5537383	5545848	I couldn't think of a fourth song that was kind of... Without doing like a four song erotic break, trying to mix up the artists a little bit, I couldn't think of a fourth song.
5546589	5551072	I'm sure now they'll be yelling ideas in the chat room, so we'll see.
5551092	5551532	Anyway.
5551552	5551772	Anyway.
5552771	5554592	We are going to open up the Skype line in a little bit.
5554612	5561335	If you're trying to call in right now, we're not going to take your call just yet because we want to give folks a chance to fire up the Skype line and call in.
5562175	5563636	www.orangeonradio.com.
5563656	5565877	Click on Interact With Us if you want more information.
5565917	5569138	Before we do that, though, I want to talk about Loki's little project.
5569983	5578909	Loki's been working on this project for several weeks now, and this is exciting to me, because he has actually finished this project.
5579009	5582111	And I've known Loki a while now, and he never finishes his projects.
5582632	5585193	This is like the first project I've seen him actually finish.
5585233	5586814	So, Loki, set it up for us.
5587555	5590757	What is this you're doing, and why did you... Angel, if you'd be so kind.
5592538	5594940	What is this you're doing, and why?
5594960	5595040	Okay.
5596443	5600484	I basically made a portable computer that's inside of an Xbox.
5601605	5601965	Why?
5602545	5603025	I don't know.
5603165	5606926	I could have simply bought a laptop for the amount of money they spent building this damn thing.
5607046	5610688	By the way, screen caps on orangeonsradio.com right now if you want to save them.
5610728	5611588	That would be lovely.
5611748	5612948	I'm sure we'd appreciate that.
5613869	5615369	Yeah, because I need, you know.
5615869	5618370	Anyways, there it is.
5618790	5619710	It's on the webcam.
5621191	5621811	The orange box.
5622554	5623254	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5653957	5655938	It's got Windows XP on it right now.
5656878	5661719	I have built a portable monitor to go with it, which is on the webcam right now.
5662179	5670841	It's actually inside of a metal CD case, and it runs off of batteries if it needs to be, which in this case it is running off of battery power right now.
5671701	5675022	Normally the PC itself actually does have a battery, however...
5676028	5680311	As of charging it up today, it looks like the battery is defective or something.
5680331	5683713	It only charged about 75% of the way before it said it was full.
5684473	5687355	And it's not, so I have to send that back.
5687395	5688536	So that kind of sucks.
5690077	5692738	Everything looks really sweet.
5692818	5694960	I wish I could open the case up for you guys to see.
5695040	5700023	It's got a UV fan on the top of it, kind of like a blower.
5701383	5706285	And so basically the whole thing is just, you know, self-contained in this Xbox case right now.
5706986	5707466	Pretty sweet.
5707486	5720632	It's kind of slow because Micro-ITX PCs are only, they have the processor built into the actual motherboard, and it's only 1 gigahertz, so we're talking a little slow, but...
5721584	5723725	You know, hey, for a portable PC, it's not bad.
5724586	5728248	I think it's interesting that the monitor is just one of those PS1 screens.
5729549	5731150	It's crazy.
5731971	5733552	How can you see things on that?
5734332	5735293	Very carefully.
5735653	5737374	Literally, it's a five-inch monitor.
5738041	5743724	And as if those 15-inch screens weren't bad enough, you are doing computing work on a 5-inch monitor.
5743965	5751869	Well, I have a shortcut on the desktop for the magnifier in case I can't read something.
5752489	5757512	Because it does get tough, especially when I set up the graphics and stuff.
5757612	5764596	I have the resolution set really low so I can actually be able to do stuff with it.
5766462	5770785	Yeah, it's a lovely shot of our floor there on the webcam right now in the massive DVD collection there.
5774208	5777750	And so, yeah, the lowest I could go... I'm sorry, what do you want?
5778010	5779411	What's the resolution by 320x240?
5779852	5782293	I don't think you can go that low, can you?
5783334	5785696	Is it the PS screen?
5785716	5793661	I'm not sure if it can go by... No, it's really actually, to be honest, because I have it 640x480 and I adjusted all the fonts so they're huge.
5794422	5794482	Um...
5795040	5796721	I can actually read it pretty well.
5796941	5803606	I mean, the icon, you know, the icons, you can read what they say on it and everything.
5804947	5806468	It's not that hard to read.
5806628	5814814	And like I said, I have the magnifier, you know, macro, or not really macro, but a shortcut to the magnifier.
5814974	5819077	And if I can't read anything, you just move it over there and you can actually read it.
5819117	5823600	There's a little window at the top that magnifies everything really big so you can actually see it.
5824096	5831042	But this monitor, I mean, not only will it output, it'll output to anything that takes the TV out, you know, or TV in.
5831182	5836306	So I can hook this up to the TV and that's, you know, you won't have any problem seeing the picture.
5836807	5842371	This is just for, you know, to make it sure portable, which I hope to take it with me to E3.
5844333	5846615	That was the whole purpose of building it in the first place.
5847475	5848156	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5863535	5867176	And the Xbox being the largest console system that I can think of.
5868416	5869536	Well, you know what's funny?
5870297	5873397	Have you shown an above shot of it where they can see the fan?
5873737	5879999	Because it's so funny because you actually drilled out that little Xbox logo that's in the center of an Xbox, and that's where you put the fan.
5880439	5882059	And I find that so hilarious.
5882099	5882579	I don't know why.
5882639	5883979	I'm so easily amused by that.
5884339	5886720	But the way you laid everything out is so funny.
5887280	5888000	Plus, I think it's funny.
5888040	5890501	You were telling me about how you were holding some of the stuff in.
5890861	5891161	You were...
5892430	5900957	Literally parts of this computer are being held together by duct tape and zip ties.
5900977	5901817	No, not duct tape.
5902558	5903799	Zip ties for the most part.
5904239	5912446	The hard drive is being held in by zip ties because the way it had to be mounted, I couldn't mount it on the bottom because I didn't have the right screws for it.
5912926	5916188	So I actually mounted it with zip ties and that sucker ain't moving.
5916208	5916709	Okay.
5917403	5918643	CD-ROM CD Burner
5937710	5938491	You actually have a drive?
5938551	5940373	I didn't realize you had a drive in there.
5940453	5941674	Where the hell did you fit that?
5941854	5943115	There's a CD burner in there.
5943135	5949059	It actually fits in there right where the normal drive would be.
5949079	5949880	That is crazy.
5949900	5954664	The only problem is lately it's been sticking, so I've got to figure out why that is.
5955124	5958286	But that barely fit in there with the fan in there.
5958807	5960788	It's literally pressed up right against the fan.
5961849	5965332	Dark Knight says if Bill Gates were to see that, Loki would be so toast right now.
5966488	5968169	It's running Microsoft Windows.
5971431	5972911	It's not like I put Linux in it.
5973071	5974392	Can you install Linux on it?
5974412	5976713	Because God knows they'll install Linux on anything they can.
5978894	5980555	I think it's quite a little complicated.
5980715	5984377	But you didn't go out and buy an Xbox and gut it.
5984477	5986258	No, I bought a case online.
5986358	5986798	On eBay.
5987519	5988019	Not on eBay.
5988059	5993762	There's an actual website that they sell case mods and stuff so you can buy clear cases.
5993782	5994862	I should have bought a clear case.
5994882	5995583	That would have been cool.
5995603	5996243	But they were like,
5996678	6004421	I bought a case and everything is mounted on my own.
6004461	6009884	I had to make and drill mounts for the motherboard.
6010004	6011985	I had to dremel the hell out of this.
6012605	6019428	I want to move it so I can show the other side here, but I'm afraid I'm going to knock the power thing out again.
6021243	6049092	but anyways, yeah, um, unlike most PCs where you have all your ports on the back of the PC this has all the ports on the side of the Xbox, so it would be on the left hand side, um, and I unfortunately cannot reach the camera over there to see that, but trust me, they're there um, and then the power's in the back, the power right now was being held on by hot glue, however that fell off, so it's being held on by uh, um wire right now, that's
6049622	6052343	Just temporary until I get some super glue to put that on there.
6052463	6058026	No, I thought the original idea for this is that it was going to be something you were going to have in a backpack or something and carry around with you.
6058166	6061128	I guess that idea is kind of out the window at this point.
6061248	6061928	What the hell?
6062689	6067651	To buy stuff to make your own wearable PC is way too expensive.
6067731	6073094	I was just thinking, my God, with a fan on the top like that, that's kind of dangerous in a way, if you're not careful.
6073254	6077156	Well, I'm going to have a grill over it, so that's not going to be a problem.
6077536	6079437	Yeah, right now, though, it doesn't have a grill over it.
6079741	6091985	That's the cool thing about this, though, is with the fan being right over... Where the fan is located is right on top of the RAM and the North and South Bridge on the motherboard.
6092025	6095866	You know, the two main chips that they have on there to do all the processing.
6096286	6100147	And then slightly diagonal of that is the processor.
6100848	6105229	So all of the heat that's generated off that is just shot out of the top like nothing.
6105809	6108130	So this PC will not overheat at all.
6109301	6109981	XBOX BOOT UP SCREEN
6134540	6135360	That is the background.
6136281	6138682	I can't get a very good shot of the picture right now.
6140143	6143965	Yeah, it says... Maybe I'll see if we can get in here.
6144785	6147787	Well, anyways, it says the Orange Box PC created by Loki.
6147887	6150548	I'll post the pictures of that screen later.
6151269	6156551	Yeah, it is the actual screen there, and I have the theme kind of going with it.
6156972	6159473	This case that's in right now, actually...
6160277	6161998	I'll probably just unplug this real quick.
6162018	6163539	Are there a lot of people out there that have done this?
6163699	6165740	Turned their Xboxes and gutted them and done PCs?
6166060	6168081	There's a few people that have.
6169162	6175045	I've seen one that they've actually shoved a GameCube inside of an Xbox as well as an Xbox.
6175546	6176326	Interesting.
6176366	6182830	Then I've seen people that have actually taken the whole Xbox stuff out, put it in a PC case with a PlayStation 2 and...
6185339	6191682	and also pretty much all the game systems all in one, which is kind of retarded, but whatever.
6192643	6200927	But yeah, and I've got to paint the case still for the modern orange as well to match the rest, but that's optional, of course.
6202028	6202548	Interesting.
6202668	6203749	All right, well, thanks for sharing.
6203809	6209472	Maybe we can get some clearer pics and put them up on our website because we don't really use our... I can use the cam page for anything.
6210152	6210813	We'll figure something out.
6210833	6211553	All right, we'll figure something out.
6211949	6215852	Anyway, we are going to open up the Skype line for some feedback if you guys want to call in.
6215872	6219074	If you want to talk about the Xbox PC, if you have any questions for Loki on that.
6219535	6225279	Or, of course, we're willing to talk to you guys for a little bit about the Pump It Up news, about the DDR news, all that stuff.
6226079	6229001	Call in right now, www.orangeloungeradio.com.
6229341	6233985	Click on the Interact With Us link for more information about how to get a hold of us through the Skype line.
6234465	6239809	Meanwhile, while we wait for that, because it takes a minute for the buffer to hit, let's say hello to Bugged, who just joined us in the studio.
6240543	6242164	Hello to Bugged, who just joined us in the studio.
6242224	6242864	How you doing, sir?
6242884	6244365	Uh, naked hot tubbing, actually.
6245386	6245606	What?
6246046	6246766	Yeah, that was yesterday.
6247407	6249007	Every night in San Jose, I did some naked hot tubbing.
6252509	6253730	Close your mouth or you're tracking flies.
6253750	6254010	Wait.
6255010	6255971	Run that by me again.
6256051	6256471	Why?
6256871	6257432	Why the hell not?
6259793	6260333	Okay, whatever.
6260613	6261274	There was a hot tub?
6262654	6262995	I don't know.
6263115	6264015	I don't know how to follow that up.
6264035	6264615	All right, let's go.
6264956	6266516	Thank God we have somebody on the Skype line.
6266556	6267557	Hi, you're on Orange Sounds Radio.
6269704	6274867	Legend of Zaku here Hello, Legend of Zaku, you're a little bit choppy tonight, what's up?
6278529	6292517	Let me see, yeah, the choppiness of my school's connection, IRC basically kicking me out You know, basically dying on me a few times, that's why they used a new program for IRC now Well, life sucks, what's on your mind?
6294731	6295291	Let me see.
6296292	6302955	All this jive about people just, you know, being so pessimistic about, you know, can I make another mix, another arcade mix?
6303015	6306136	That's just really, I don't know, that's kind of getting to me personally.
6307817	6312259	You're just upset that people are pretty much writing it off and people are saying it's never going to happen?
6312839	6314000	They're doubters.
6314060	6317181	I mean, they're basically pessimistic as we speak.
6317201	6320582	I'm not saying any names, but that's the mood I'm sensing right now.
6320943	6321323	Well...
6322645	6328027	You can't say that there's for sure never going to be another Konami arcade mix because there is one coming out in Europe.
6328087	6328728	We know that much.
6328928	6329708	Yes.
6330308	6337051	If it does good, then Konami can rethink their plans of bringing it stateside.
6337312	6340773	Is it possible there will be a new arcade mix?
6340933	6341614	I say yes.
6342134	6342394	But...
6343167	6346133	I don't think we really know at this point what's going to happen.
6346153	6351222	If it's going to happen tomorrow, if it's going to happen in the next couple of years, or what.
6351242	6352985	Is this a life-turning event for you?
6353967	6354188	Well...
6355109	6368215	No, but at the same time, it's kind of sad that DDR introduced me to all these people and gave me an idea for a radio show that we've been doing for the past few years and everything.
6368695	6373697	It's just kind of sad that DDR helped with all that and now the game is not happening.
6374117	6376118	And that's why people are so passionate about it.
6376158	6379400	Because people have been sucking down on Xtreme for about two years now.
6380363	6391087	I agree that the longer it goes on, the more that the other games, like In the Groove and Pump It Up, are going to catch on.
6391187	6393787	So I agree that Konami is shooting themselves in the foot, but what can you do?
6393807	6396028	What the hell?
6396488	6396888	What the hell?
6401880	6404583	I don't know what that noise was either, but that's right.
6405644	6419158	Well, you know, as far as the petitions and things go, that's all nice and dandy, but I think it really sits in Konami of Japan's court, and we're all basically their bitches right now until they make a decision.
6421536	6424158	Don't we have advocates such as Jason Enos?
6424859	6425900	Don't we got these people?
6425980	6427141	They're fabulous more.
6441454	6441994	Fabulous!
6442554	6455717	DDR Extreme, despite all the crap... Well, despite all the crap DDR Extreme got from some people, they tried something different, they tried a lot of new things, and for the most part, it was pretty cool.
6455857	6458037	And for the casual player, it was very cool.
6458457	6462638	So, as far as DDR Home stuff in America, they're really not doing anything wrong.
6462838	6463738	They're doing everything right.
6464338	6465658	So, you can't fault them.
6466579	6467519	So, I don't know.
6467959	6468259	I know.
6470383	6473786	I know, I can't, I know, I can accept that, but, you know, come on now.
6473946	6479010	Two years without a mix, that's just, you know, there has to be something done.
6479791	6480151	Anything.
6480231	6485095	I don't care if you just make at least a faint, you know, action of just starting to make one.
6485575	6490197	I would care as long as I know that you guys are thinking, as long as I know that Konami's thinking of something.
6490397	6493498	Well, hopefully they'll give us a clue at some point.
6493538	6499139	But anyway, Zach, we're going to let you go because there's a bunch of people trying to get in and you're kind of fading out anyway, so I've got to let you go, buddy.
6499179	6499760	But have a good one.
6499800	6500400	Thanks for calling.
6500780	6501060	Later.
6502481	6504001	All right, let's pick up this one.
6504901	6505942	Hi, you're on Orange Lawns Radio.
6507002	6508462	Hey, Sky, it's Al Mullet again.
6508603	6509403	Hello, Al Mullet.
6509423	6509903	What's on your mind?
6511209	6515512	Well, basically, Legend of Zaku was talking about how he wasn't going to name names.
6515552	6517193	Well, that was the other half of that argument.
6517293	6518334	Okay, all right.
6518374	6520195	So you want to give us the other half of the story here, then?
6520796	6533884	Well, basically, all my other half was is that I'm sure Konami would love to release another arcade mix here in the States, but then again, they're going to have to look at how profitable is it going to be for them at this point in time.
6536686	6536706	I...
6538343	6541725	I would think it's profitable, personally, but I don't know.
6541825	6546607	I mean, I don't have... I have a skewed perspective, and I think we all do as DDR addicts.
6546667	6550349	We think our game is perfect and it's making Konami tons of money, and we don't really know.
6551010	6563336	But when I see the imitators doing well, such as Pump It Up is doing so well that now they're going to do a home release, it kind of makes me go, hmm, if the imitators are doing well...
6565569	6576276	That's true, but now that the imitators are moving to the home markets, I'm hoping that this news about Puppet Up being released on a console in the US is a huge wake-up call.
6576596	6585662	But then again, the US console scene is not where Konami needs a wake-up call, because as I said in the last call, they're doing everything right, as far as I'm concerned.
6586483	6587504	That's true, that's true.
6587884	6589405	They're not the ones that need the wake-up call.
6589465	6591066	They should go out and release this in Japan.
6592569	6598393	Right, I mean, the one thing that really... Which I guess they've done already, but who knows.
6598433	6603196	The one thing that really gets me is that people are bitching and moaning, the U.S.
6603236	6606898	needs a new arcade mix when there hasn't been a new U.S.
6607038	6608559	arcade mix in years.
6609700	6616824	Well, that's a very good point, is people often confuse these Japanese releases that get imported as U.S.
6617184	6618085	releases, but...
6618935	6624576	Not only that, but we kind of shot our own selves in the foot as far as US arcade games go.
6625096	6633938	Because when DDRUSA was released, the arcade version, it seemed more people wanted to play the imports.
6633958	6636899	They wanted to play the ones with the 50, the 80, the 100 song lists.
6636959	6640400	Well, because DDRUSA, for the most part, was crap.
6640440	6643601	And so was the first home release, when you put it side by side with the import.
6643641	6645161	But now, I trust...
6646038	6649199	Canami of America way more now than I would have back then.
6649920	6654142	Because I would think that if they put out an arcade, like I said, I said this when Ultra Mix 2 first came out.
6654622	6656883	Make Canami of Hawaii do the next arcade mix.
6657303	6658604	We'll all want to have sex with it.
6658704	6659364	It'll be beautiful.
6661945	6663366	Hook up with a different drum again.
6664166	6665047	It'll be a beautiful mix.
6665914	6666775	Nobody's going to complain.
6667055	6669758	I agree 100% with you there, Sky.
6669798	6676185	Anyway, moving off of this subject, the reason why I wanted to call was because of the new P.I.U.
6676305	6677306	North American release.
6678026	6680449	Sometimes I just like to take the I out and call it P.U.,
6682142	6682623	I just got here.
6682703	6683083	I just got here.
6683103	6683944	There's been no comedy.
6683964	6685025	There's a song list for the U.S.
6685045	6685465	one out?
6709608	6717550	Yeah, if you check down in the DDR Freak thread, if you check down like very low in the second post, they've already released a song list.
6718110	6725052	It's going to be very heavily influenced by the Korean version, the Korean home version.
6725772	6732994	It's going to be 85 songs, tons of banya, there's going to be tons of K-pop.
6733194	6734575	Surprise, tons of banya.
6735115	6735875	Yeah, obviously.
6736670	6738351	But there's going to be lots of K-pop.
6739693	6743015	You've heard that there's going to be some exclusive American content.
6744617	6748720	The K-pop dwarfs that by like five or six times.
6748940	6749741	Interesting.
6750462	6754085	Are you saying the song list is on page two of that thread, is what you said?
6754405	6754865	Page two.
6754985	6755546	Oh, there it is.
6756247	6756547	I see it.
6756607	6757147	Okay, never mind.
6757187	6757528	I got it.
6757588	6757888	I see it.
6758268	6759409	Ooh, we get Starion.
6759449	6759990	That's hot.
6760410	6761171	Yeah, definitely.
6761191	6762252	That's an obvious one.
6762512	6763773	Yeah, I know, but that song's so hot.
6763813	6763953	NXT 2.
6767759	6769360	Crystal Method, Name of the Game.
6770000	6775282	Wasn't somebody, somebody was saying that that song needed to be in a dance game for like the longest time.
6775422	6776242	Was it you, Lanky?
6776882	6779983	I'm thinking Lanky Style said it, but maybe it was you, Loki.
6780083	6780443	I don't know.
6781004	6781524	That's hot.
6782224	6785505	Elvis, Little Less Conversation, which is funny, that's a DDR song.
6785885	6790127	Let's Groove, not the DDR version, but the original Earth, Wind, Fire.
6791307	6793348	And Rapper's Delight, Sugar Hill Gang.
6793448	6794308	What the hell?
6794868	6796189	Hey, that's kind of hot.
6797059	6799682	They're borrowing a lot from Dancing Stage, I can see.
6800022	6801064	Interesting.
6801464	6802365	Seems to be interesting.
6802946	6803486	Alright.
6804287	6806470	And then, like, just a whole shitload of Banya songs.
6807448	6825325	I've also noticed that we have about 15 songs less so far than the Korean version and I think that's a pretty good move because it seems like in the Korean song list they put all of their good stuff on one disc and I don't like that.
6825625	6833412	If I see all of their good stuff in one game it probably means that they're not going to have a hell of a lot of good stuff for the sequel.
6834958	6838923	My only concern with buying this game at this point is that I don't want to spend the money on the other pad.
6839204	6840726	So this game better be well-priced.
6842608	6850338	But they say this is going to be bundled with a pad, so at least there's that.
6851260	6852341	Well, I'm willing to check it out.
6854304	6856485	I'm just happy that I get to play Turkey March at home.
6858245	6859106	I'm not that fickle.
6860226	6861967	For DDR, it's Moonlight Shadow.
6862567	6864527	And to a lesser extent, Undude Trois.
6864647	6866928	For Pump It Up, it's Turkey March.
6867708	6868109	You know what?
6868189	6870169	And for me, it's Funky Tonight.
6870289	6871050	I love that song.
6871330	6872930	And Starion.
6873951	6875891	So I'm thrilled as hell about this mix.
6876231	6876831	So that's cool.
6877392	6880893	Thank you for giving us a heads up to the song list there.
6880913	6881413	I appreciate that.
6881897	6883779	www.insidepulse.com visit it, love it, read his column have a good one, bye bye
6903001	6903962	Yeah, I agree too.
6904462	6906944	I would read it all for you guys, but there's a lot to it.
6906984	6910687	But basically, all those big pump songs you guys know about, they're in there.
6910967	6914570	Actually, I didn't see if Run To You was in there, but somebody in the chatroom will tell me.
6914630	6923476	I don't think so, because they took out the license for Run To You and XSEED 2, and they're probably taking out the new license from DJ Doc itself.
6924537	6925398	Maybe, I don't know, we'll see.
6925438	6926599	Somebody in the chatroom will tell me, I don't know.
6926619	6927059	We'll see what's up.
6927899	6930580	Alright, why don't we get to the cage match?
6930660	6933982	I will open up the Skype line again a little bit later in the show if you guys are interested in calling in.
6934022	6940445	But for right now, we're going to get into the Orange Lounge Radio cage match because we're running a little bit behind in show right now.
6941666	6945188	So remember guys, if you want to participate in the cage match, you have to be in our chat room.
6946108	6950910	www.orangeloungeradio.com and click on chat.
6952771	6953972	And we're going to move into the cage match.
6956129	6960194	The way the Orange Lounge Radio Cage Match works, we play three songs for you guys.
6960214	6969604	You guys vote on your favorite, and the winning song goes into rotation all week long on Orange Lounge Radio's 24-7 Bomani Music & More program.
6970185	6974971	Last week in the Orange Lounge Cage Match, Freeze Poop, I'm sorry, Freeze Pop won.
6977625	6979607	You have to hear all their songs so you can get that joke.
6980028	6988297	Freeze Pop, a favorite band of ours from Amplitude and Frequency and Boston, won with their song called Stakeout.
6992119	6992960	All right, well, we'll see.
6993240	6996503	Will Loki be happy and Freeze Pop will be voted out tonight?
6996943	6999726	Or will I be happy and this song stays in for another week?
6999786	7000426	We will find out.
7000466	7001567	It's in your hands, you guys.
7001988	7004990	Here's a clip, because you only get to hear a clip because it won last week.
7005331	7007312	Remember, you can't vote until all three songs have played.
7007352	7011256	Here's a clip of song number one, last week's winner, Freeze Pop, Stakeout.
7034508	7038672	I'm on a stakeout I'm on a stakeout I'm on a stakeout
7056913	7069687	I've got a plan in mind for you I'm waiting till the time is right I know that you like what I do No need to put up a fight Watching you from far away You look so sweet and clueless Soon I'll move in on my prey It's time for me to do this
7086620	7096250	The feeling is elating, biding my time Yeah, I know that you'll soon be mine Soon to mine Can't let you see me, can't let you see me, can't let you see me
7129688	7132511	DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
7150464	7158366	I picked this song by a group that sounds just like Echo Image, and they also have, their group name is almost like Echo Image, it's Echoing Green.
7159286	7159686	Okay.
7161066	7162447	And this is the time of my life.
7163087	7164347	Actually, it's the story of our lives.
7164387	7167628	Whatever, story of our lives, time of my life, close enough.
7167708	7168868	Story of our lives.
7169068	7170488	Any reason you wanted to pick this?
7171008	7173509	It just, I don't know, it reminded me of Echo Image.
7174429	7178910	Alright, here it is, song number two, Loki's pick, Echoing Green, Story of Our Lives.
7194696	7200479	and everything is meaningless when the weather's waiting we're captive to this place
7247303	7272881	A song to stay behind to sing the story of our lives In this place, loneliness is never-ending constant
7281538	7282903	DarkSakura.com
7360931	7361971	Music Music Music Music Music
7392152	7392739	Thanks for watching!
7480013	7480574	Thanks for watching!
7510539	7512779	Okay, that was song number two in tonight's cage match.
7512919	7515340	Echoing Green, Story of Our Lives.
7515800	7517920	Let's see what we thought of that here in the room.
7518040	7519421	Start off with Angel tonight.
7520461	7523821	I thought it did remind me a little bit of Echo Image, so I'll give them that.
7524081	7526022	Um, it's pretty good.
7526042	7528762	Um, seven and a half.
7529502	7530423	Alright, Exquisite.
7532503	7533623	Uh, Nate, it's pretty good.
7533963	7536164	I can see a big influence on Echo Image.
7536544	7536944	Alright.
7537724	7538044	Uh, Bug.
7540470	7540770	What?
7542951	7544332	Give it a score on a scale of 1 to 10.
7545513	7546013	Alright, fine.
7546053	7546373	Loki.
7547314	7547654	Loki.
7548775	7552617	I liked it, so it gets a 9.
7553658	7561923	For once, I actually kind of like a song that Loki put in Cage Match a whole lot, but I think it's a little long and it's kind of weird for Cage Match.
7562083	7566426	I don't know if I could hear that on our station, but I like the song, so I have to give it at least an 8.
7567246	7567787	It's not like an 8.5.
7568877	7573761	Alright, let's get into song number three this week, which comes to us via DarkSakura.
7573861	7578165	Even though she's not here tonight, she still gets to put a song in, so here it is.
7578605	7581948	She has chosen some Schwarzstein for you guys.
7583169	7586372	And I believe it's a band she put in Cage Match before, but this is a new song.
7586412	7589734	It's called Faster Love, and it's song number three in tonight's Cage Match.
7589774	7590235	Enjoy, you guys.
7593945	7594646	Thanks for watching!
7626988	7628190	Thanks for watching!
7657057	7658158	Thank you for watching!
7717350	7719671	Thank you for watching!
7747831	7749132	DarkSakura
7789491	7790872	Thank you for watching.
7790932	7792233	See you next time.
7822182	7823422	Thank you for watching!
7845262	7846602	Thank you for watching!
7880515	7885659	Song number three, Schwerstein, and that was actually called Festerlove, not Fasterlove.
7885699	7886940	I fucked that up when I was announcing it.
7886960	7887620	It's Festerlove.
7887920	7891303	I have a strange feeling that Jamie picked that one on purpose with the holiday tomorrow.
7891463	7891823	I don't know.
7892604	7892904	Angel.
7895005	7897347	It was okay.
7897407	7899569	I'm not sure if that's it.
7900790	7901750	She's seven.
7902971	7903291	All right.
7904292	7904772	Exquisite.
7905793	7906514	You have to...
7907392	7909213	I dub it Cher Takes Up Nose Whistling.
7909253	7910514	It went on far too long.
7910534	7910634	Three.
7910694	7911014	Uh, Loki.
7934600	7940282	If Cher were retarded and were to sing gothic music, that would be the song.
7941602	7945043	So it gets a 2.
7945303	7948704	That song, I kind of liked the beat a lot.
7949764	7953005	So that was really cool, and I was all into the song when it first started.
7953025	7957466	But the guy's voice, if emo were on a scale of 0 to 10, he was like a 15.
7957586	7960947	It just made me want to slit my wrist.
7961417	7965358	So, I don't know, I guess I would give it like a... Six and a half?
7965578	7966058	Eh, seven.
7966138	7967098	I'll give it a seven overall.
7968079	7972640	I mean, I like the music a lot, it was just the guy's voice was kind of like, oh god, ah, wow.
7973080	7976841	Alright, so remember though, it isn't up to us, it's up to you guys in the chatroom.
7977201	7979182	So here it is, a recap, and then you can vote.
7979282	7983163	Song number one you can vote for tonight is last week's winner, Freeze Pop with Stakeout.
7989963	7994046	And song number two you can vote for tonight is Echoing Green, Story of Our Lives.
8003172	8007255	And song number three you can vote for tonight is Schwarzstein, Fester Love.
8007875	8014139	And song number three you can vote for tonight is Schwarzstein, Fester Love.
8015888	8019470	Alright guys, place vote now.
8019610	8023653	Send a private message to Sky in the chat room with your vote.
8024273	8028856	And we will tally all those votes up and let you guys know who the winner is very soon.
8030277	8034019	In the meantime, Loki, what's going on in the sim scene right now?
8036341	8043105	You know, I hate to say this, but nothing, absolutely nada is happening in the sim scene right now.
8044146	8044686	I can't even...
8045757	8050360	I can't really even comment on anything that's going on because really there's nothing going on.
8050520	8050860	Nothing.
8050980	8051220	Zip.
8052041	8052781	No tournaments.
8053442	8054442	No files.
8055563	8056123	No nothing.
8056204	8057084	Just nothing.
8058545	8062828	However, however, I will take this time to play you one little song.
8063668	8068611	Because this is a sim file and yes, it's one of those ones I downloaded.
8068751	8069071	Why?
8069192	8071713	Because it says Max 300 Remix.
8072894	8074695	So why do I... I thought you hated those Maxes.
8075294	8076696	I have to listen to every single one.
8076856	8080180	It is my duty to listen to them just in case there's a good one.
8080280	8082843	And honestly, that happens every now and then.
8083363	8089230	So, this song, for your listening pleasure, is Max Vagina.
8090211	8090712	That's right.
8091172	8092093	Max Vagina.
8092293	8092654	Enjoy.
8092674	8093835	Max Vagina.
8199349	8203311	So yeah, that's what's going on in the sim scene right there.
8203371	8205793	Explicit, did you get a boner with that song?
8205853	8207274	I was about to say that, no!
8208815	8209495	It struck more.
8210856	8212237	What the hell was that?
8212677	8215559	Seriously, what was that?
8215599	8216840	I can explain what that is.
8217500	8219061	I know where the sources are from, it
8219676	8221896	Okay, first I take away... Wait a minute, wait a minute.
8221916	8223857	Is this why you had to give up the boner thing for Lent?
8226798	8227798	I'm not gonna comment from that.
8228538	8229598	It's not even close.
8229658	8232459	Because there's no visuals.
8232619	8233979	Sound effects, okay, I can handle.
8234599	8241221	I can hear... All the time without getting a boner, but... Visuals... Is where it comes from.
8241341	8242521	Anyways, back to the story.
8243041	8244201	Lent was crap.
8244781	8246522	I know the sources where it came from.
8246602	8247362	It's basically Max150...
8252237	8269937	and I think the sound effects that were like the porno sounds is from the video the porno video from City Crawford I actually have that DVD too it's from a song by a group called the Porno Rockers that's the group name um
8272000	8275242	Yeah, it's just like, you know, I don't know.
8275262	8276904	It's more like a cut and paste issue.
8277244	8280446	I download that stuff just because, you know, it's fun to hear.
8280866	8285610	You just have to listen to them because you don't really realize how bad they are.
8286130	8287791	But then again, those are funny sometimes.
8288732	8292054	To the person who made that, screw you.
8292415	8295557	Seriously, sorry, but what the hell was that?
8296738	8325699	You can think, BanzaiGTV Oh, I know, I've seen this guy remixed, okay And he has done other sim files also, like Sabrina, a step file announcer, which is someone on But we have Paranoia Extreme Rock Mix, Twinkle Twinkle Shocking Star, the Sailor Moon theme Yeah, he's got quite a bit of stuff he's done, but whatever
8326829	8328049	I don't know, I thought that was funny.
8328389	8332191	This is why I stopped downloading stuff from Be Mighty Star, unless they're good quality.
8333911	8339953	I'm sick and tired of hearing Max remixes that are cut and paste, that sound like too much cut and paste.
8341473	8343334	All I have to say is dot, dot, dot.
8344934	8346815	You guys want to find out who won tonight's cage match?
8347955	8348535	You ready to know?
8348555	8350376	Alright, here it is.
8351096	8354817	Winning song of tonight's cage match as determined by your votes...
8357765	8358986	Freeze Pop!
8360167	8363349	Two weeks in a row, Freeze Pop wins tonight.
8364490	8366591	Not very many votes ahead of the other two, though.
8366792	8368153	Kind of surprising, it was kind of close.
8368213	8373096	A lot more votes for songs two and three than I would have guessed from the initial chatroom feedback.
8374717	8379741	Some very interesting thoughts there in the chatroom.
8380276	8381397	Anyway, we're going to go to a break.
8382337	8386760	I'm out of theme ideas for this break, so I think we're just going to play random stuff in this break.
8388301	8392444	We'll come back after this with more Orange Lounge Radio, including the FUs of the week.
8393204	8397887	I want to do a little more Skype later on if we can, etc., etc.
8397988	8400909	So in this break, we'll start off with The Shining Polaris.
8400949	8401870	We haven't played this song in a while.
8402130	8402911	We'll be back after this.
8403791	8404532	More Orange Lounge Radio.

8853448	8858150	Holla!
8859090	8866853	Hello and welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio, episode 131 in progress.
8867113	8868194	We just wrapped up the cage match.
8868214	8869434	We're going to move into the FUs of the Week.
8870120	8882269	However, what we're going to do now is actually, I wanted to talk to some folks, some friends of the show, because I figured, you know, it's Valentine's Day and this would be an appropriate theme to do, right?
8882670	8885752	We're going to talk to an actual DDR couple.
8887433	8888354	Isn't this going to be nice?
8888494	8889375	Alright, let's talk to them.
8889415	8890916	Let me give them a call and see if they pick up.
8892197	8895079	I figured something to fit with the theme of the holiday coming up.
8895700	8896280	One ringy dingy.
8901597	8902558	Hello?
8904178	8904639	Hello?
8904899	8905399	Hello?
8906880	8908641	Hi, is this Jason and Raichan?
8909301	8910041	It may be.
8911342	8912102	I think it is.
8912683	8913003	It is.
8913223	8913943	How are you guys?
8914464	8915124	We're pretty good.
8915664	8917645	Happy Valentine's Day a little early to you guys.
8918165	8919146	Thank you, Rob.
8919306	8921787	Now, you guys are under the same roof right now, correct?
8922268	8922468	Yep.
8922788	8923208	Thankfully.
8924184	8925345	Awww, so cute.
8925745	8930428	Because now, for those that don't know, you guys are kind of doing one of those long-distance thingy-thingies, right?
8930908	8931128	Yep.
8931648	8934730	So you have to travel once in a while to see each other, so... Yep.
8935030	8936191	That's what's going on right now.
8936591	8941754	Well, with the holiday coming up, and I can't help but think of all those threads on DDR Freak that goes...
8942344	8945127	Oh my gods, how do I meet a girlfriend playing DDR?
8945767	8951473	So I just thought maybe you guys could share a little bit about how you guys met and how it moved on, everything like that.
8951493	8954055	If you could give us a little history of your guys' relationship.
8956217	8959180	Well, see, me being a whole Southwest moderator...
8962230	8963730	Slurred over private messages.
8984105	8990970	and me being the good, dutiful moderator had to tell her that, hey, right-hand, your images are too big.
8991110	8992391	Could you link them for me, please?
8994152	8999736	And as soon as I did that, I was rummaging around LiveJournal and apparently she knew one of my friends as well.
9000317	9005881	I saw her avatar and a picture and a comment and we just kind of started talking.
9006826	9013048	And you actually forgot to mention the fact that in that PM it said, I hate to cover up such a pretty face.
9013128	9015289	Oh, of course, you have to have that.
9015989	9016970	Oh, la la la.
9017130	9017930	Oh, that's so cute.
9020471	9022752	Right, Chan, what was your reaction when you got the private message?
9022872	9025253	Were you like, ah, who's this weirdo hitting on me, or what?
9025913	9027714	At that point, I didn't see it as that.
9027814	9032256	It's kind of amusing, because I was still, oh my god, it's the moderator, he's messaging me.
9036590	9040132	So you guys didn't meet necessarily at an arcade or anything.
9040172	9042033	You actually met through the online forums.
9042954	9044475	So what was the first time you guys met in person?
9046776	9047596	November 1st.
9047736	9049077	Yes, the night after Halloween.
9050178	9050758	How did it work out?
9050798	9051459	How did you guys meet?
9051519	9052099	How did it all happen?
9053160	9057202	I was going to take a trip up to Colorado, and I did.
9058823	9059903	It's just that simple, huh?
9060444	9060884	Pretty much.
9061805	9064186	Wow, well, you make interviewing really easy then.
9064734	9068857	I must get dead pleasing.
9070098	9074001	Officially, it would be, what, a year and a month now?
9074562	9081166	And that was only three months before when we first met, so one year and four months now, and one year and one month officially.
9081186	9082968	Mm-hmm.
9087256	9090578	So do you guys play DDR together or any of that dorky stuff?
9090658	9092779	Or what do you guys, is DDR just kind of there?
9092840	9094440	It's just an interest you guys both have?
9094501	9098863	Or do you sometimes go out and do the nerdy Bomani things together, like travel to arcades?
9098903	9099644	Or what do you guys do?
9099684	9102185	Yesterday I went to MGL.
9102345	9104187	Well, mostly Jason Blade.
9104527	9106868	The night before that we went and played some 2DX.
9107609	9108689	Played a little bit of DDR.
9109210	9111011	Beatmania 3, Dance Maniacs.
9112412	9114413	Do you guys have little competitions or anything like that?
9115854	9117275	She owns me in home versions.
9117716	9120178	I usually do it a little bit better in the arcade, but not always.
9121039	9121900	Oh, that's kind of cute.
9122481	9122621	Yeah.
9123461	9124703	Any plans for the big day tomorrow?
9126544	9132330	Going to work, unfortunately for me, but I'm going to go in early so I can get out early and take her out to dinner or something really nice.
9132590	9135093	Did somebody say fucking in the microphone?
9136354	9137075	Shame on you.
9137135	9138136	This is a family show.
9139433	9141874	Bug just... Was that Angel?
9142255	9143295	Angel did that?
9143355	9143575	No.
9144076	9144596	It was Bug.
9144836	9146377	Bug was whispering in the microphone.
9146698	9150020	Fucking... He probably just couldn't hear it.
9152341	9153742	That's none of your business.
9153983	9154883	That's none of your business.
9154903	9155944	Don't you know that's rude?
9157565	9158145	Damn straight.
9158606	9159046	Sides.
9160107	9162829	We all know they're going to stay virginal until they get married.
9163549	9163829	Right?
9164430	9164630	Yeah.
9164910	9165430	Okay, anyway.
9166711	9167652	Let's change the topic.
9170864	9173365	I thought I already changed the topic right there.
9173585	9181511	Do you guys have any advice for those guys out there that are all sad because of the Valentine's Day holiday and all they want is a gamer girlfriend?
9181591	9182531	Do you guys have any advice?
9183392	9184293	Stop whining.
9184693	9185694	Stop bitching.
9186214	9188475	Stop obsessing.
9189096	9193719	And be yourself and try opening your mouth and shutting it normally.
9194219	9196321	And commit suicide.
9196421	9197261	Amen to all that.
9197341	9198022	Stop it, Loki.
9198302	9198682	Stop it.
9199142	9199763	And buy lots of lube.
9201844	9205207	She's also had people try hitting on me through her.
9230766	9233667	Well, they express their, uh, fads.
9234487	9239269	I wouldn't say, no, not fantasies, but they express their heavy likes for me.
9239749	9240589	Other guys, yes.
9241690	9243790	And I apologize profusely about that, Jason.
9244490	9247091	It's okay, Rob.
9247111	9247831	We know you're on it.
9248632	9256074	All these nerdy people need to do is just rent a porno, get a nice dinner, and it's like a date right there.
9258567	9258967	Wow.
9287523	9289265	For some reason, I failed to be surprised.
9289285	9292968	I mean, I know it firsthand, though.
9292988	9293188	Thank you.
9317012	9320556	No, actually, I got invited to a gay singles dinner.
9321918	9324701	How gay is that in the overview?
9326223	9328345	But yeah, definitely, I'm going, obviously.
9328846	9331609	It's one of my buddies that's having it, so I'm like, okay, yeah, it sounds like fun.
9332850	9334632	So there's something for everybody on Valentine's Day.
9335053	9335233	What?
9336141	9338823	I'm sure you'll have a gay old time.
9338923	9343507	I will, and then I'm going to come home and masturbate until the sun rises next day.
9343907	9344688	I'm kidding, I'm kidding.
9344708	9345649	Thanks for the details.
9345749	9347210	I'm kidding, I'm kidding, I'm totally kidding.
9348051	9350673	Anything else you guys want to share about... You don't have that much stamina.
9351554	9351874	Shut up.
9352354	9353735	Anything else you guys want to share?
9354096	9357178	Any exciting things going on this week while she's paying a visit?
9359300	9363303	For some reason I keep thinking she's going to leave on Saturday, but she's actually here until Tuesday.
9363924	9365345	And so that's making me happy every day.
9365365	9365665	I think I'm
9366908	9369109	Aw, you were cutting out for half that sentence, but that's okay.
9369129	9369729	It's still cute.
9370249	9374511	We're trying to share a headset to the best of our ability.
9374931	9375311	Oh, I see.
9375331	9375751	That's cool.
9376712	9380073	Rai-Chan, any plans for this week?
9381614	9382134	Not really.
9382894	9384195	Just enjoying each other's company?
9384215	9385795	Spend it normally, like our advice says.
9386215	9386515	Okay.
9386856	9387336	That's cool.
9387616	9388076	Works for me.
9388096	9389116	All right, you guys.
9389316	9392057	Thanks for letting us bug you, and have a happy Valentine's Day, okay?
9392117	9392778	Thank you, Rob.
9392798	9393358	You're welcome.
9393378	9393558	Thank you.
9393925	9394445	Bye.
9394525	9394925	Kisses.
9395266	9396126	Bye-bye.
9396406	9398847	It was nice to talk to them.
9399247	9399487	What?
9400367	9401548	None of us here are bitter, right?
9402828	9403329	Let's see.
9404409	9409631	Single, single, single, dating, engaged.
9410451	9410911	Bitch boy.
9413272	9415693	So we got mostly single, but anyway.
9417194	9417474	Oh, well.
9420157	9422298	What we're going to do now is we're going to get into another segment.
9422338	9429083	I thought it would be very good to follow up the very lovey-dovey, aw, isn't that cute segment with one of our favorite segments, the FUs of the week.
9430824	9433786	So what we're going to do now is get into those FUs of the week.
9434046	9437989	This is the part, oh, by the way, if you guys want to send in an FU of the week, just send me a private message.
9438089	9443412	My name is Sky in the chat room with your FU, but please try to keep it somewhat reasonable in length.
9443772	9446094	If it's too long, I'm going to cut it short because I can do that.
9448573	9450174	That includes you in studio.
9451855	9457340	So this is the part where I would normally ask Jamie, why do we do the FUs of the week every single week?
9457400	9461323	But she's not here, so I'm going to ask Loki, why is it we do the FUs of the week every single week?
9462524	9463524	Because we have anger.
9470149	9471931	Oh, this is bad.
9472011	9472551	Here is justice.
9472651	9473932	Here is punishment.
9479835	9484456	Even though DarkSakura is not here tonight, she's spending the time with her boyfriend.
9484496	9486857	She did want me to enter in an FU on behalf.
9487217	9488997	She would like to give an FU to people.
9489497	9490398	In general, everybody.
9491298	9491898	So there you go.
9492138	9493238	I'll give an FU straight back.
9493778	9494078	Alright.
9494999	9495839	Loki's turn!
9498319	9498820	Fuck you, dude.
9498840	9502981	The company that sold me the goddamn battery for my Orange Box PC.
9503481	9506041	Because the battery is defective.
9506281	9507402	It will not charge.
9507562	9508842	In fact, um...
9509580	9514725	It charges, according to the battery, about only 75% of the way, because only three of the four lights are on there.
9515445	9520590	And not only that, when I was trying to charge it and plugging it in, it's all sparky now, the little bottom thing.
9521090	9522892	So that's probably not a good sign either.
9523393	9529316	So anyways, so fuck you then, because that battery cost me almost $200, and that doesn't make me too happy.
9530177	9545585	And then finally, fuck you to The Matrix Online, because I went to go play it yesterday, just to give it a second go around, and it was admins only on that one server I was on, so I said fuck it, I'm tired of this.
9547116	9548137	So I'm not going to play it.
9549258	9553183	And it sucks for me for not having any money.
9553243	9556927	So fuck it to me for spending my money on useless shit that I don't need.
9557407	9558548	A.K.A.
9558568	9559669	the Orange Box.
9560550	9564134	And yeah, that's pretty much it right now.
9573530	9592223	I'd like to give an F you to myself for being all fashion conscious last night and I was seriously being such a woman and I like changed my outfit like four times before I was willing to leave the house and I was like how does my hair look and I was making I was making Loki and his girlfriend like you know be my fashion judges or whatever so an F you to that.
9593338	9593519	D.R.
9593639	9593839	ANGEL
9609693	9631307	Alright, uh, F you to me for, like, not watching my book more carefully this week, cause I had to get it swiped at least, you know, for 48 hours, and I got all, like, paranoid and, uh, stressed and all that crap, and so the book got, uh, returned to me on Thursday, and all that, so, screw that, um...
9632779	9640465	F you to KTHR closing down because, um, you know, it was too soon, in my opinion.
9641106	9644048	But, you know, there's nothing I can do about now, so screw that.
9644308	9644789	Whatever.
9645449	9647931	I'll live on, or, you know, I'll move on.
9648592	9650133	And, uh, fuck you to being an I.L.
9650153	9655778	because it just makes, you know, that alarm that much sooner to go off and it sucks.
9655818	9656198	Whatever.
9656218	9656318	Um...
9660546	9661386	I guess that's about it.
9661526	9662586	I don't really know.
9664107	9666527	I lost my train of thought, so I guess it doesn't matter.
9667948	9668288	Alright.
9668488	9669828	So, whatever, I'm done.
9670228	9671929	Alright, let's move on to Bud.
9671949	9680751	Thank you to myself, because I forgot to invite you to the after funeral party on Tuesday night.
9681751	9682891	It was Jägermeister.
9683531	9684151	You're in trouble.
9684451	9685011	No, that's alright.
9685051	9685432	It's cool.
9685472	9685912	I understand.
9685932	9686652	But, uh...
9687699	9689540	Too bad all those people aren't still in town, though.
9689920	9691261	I bet they'd love to see me now.
9691801	9692541	I'm fabulous.
9693061	9693301	What?
9693462	9694402	Most of them are, actually.
9694422	9695923	Most of them didn't actually leave town.
9696203	9696583	Oh, really?
9696603	9698264	Oh, we should all hang out or something.
9698724	9699424	We're going to try.
9699964	9702806	But, uh... I'm a little different than I was in high school.
9703166	9703346	Nah.
9703526	9707087	I never would have guessed.
9707188	9709769	Oh, your flame's showing.
9710049	9710629	Oh, sorry.
9712350	9714991	Uh... F you to the barrier, DJ.
9715011	9716211	You're so damn far away.
9716912	9717252	Yeah.
9717771	9718231	Agreed.
9718511	9720893	I still want to know about this naked hot tubbing stuff.
9722734	9723814	Whose place was this at?
9724294	9726776	I can't tell you.
9726856	9727756	Okay, alright, fine.
9728597	9732238	There was a dual G5 Power Mac involved, too.
9733139	9734219	Power Mac, okay.
9735520	9735900	Hot.
9735920	9737481	Alright.
9738702	9739122	Fair enough.
9739982	9742984	And, well, of course, the usual FUs to kill viruses.
9743764	9743944	Okay.
9744044	9746465	And not enough time in the fucking week.
9749706	9750406	Fair enough.
9751047	9752128	Alright, explicit.
9755291	9763218	I want to give an FD to some white Ford Mustang for trying to run my ass over when it says walk on my part.
9763438	9773347	When I'm walking in the pedestrian... No, I should not be run over just because you're in a damn hurry running 60 miles an hour and turning right on a red lane.
9774028	9774689	My god, I...
9776750	9782032	and FU2 and Zuma469 for causing a shitload of drama on the tournament, obviously.
9783453	9786895	If you don't like the rules, don't even go to the tournaments.
9787235	9789776	You send us to numerous tournaments and we're getting sick of it.
9790616	9796999	You bring your drama, personal drama, that Team469 shouldn't even be involved, and you bring it in front of our faces.
9797600	9798280	Look what happens.
9798940	9799801	Now you're banned.
9800721	9801922	Luckily we did not kick your ass.
9804255	9807779	I want to give an F you for my video card from frying up like shit.
9809942	9814667	Somehow, like, I think I started smelling smoke on my video card for Radeon 9800.
9814747	9819353	I still have to fix the problem, but if I can't fix it, I have to...
9820533	9834718	and FU2 whoever turned off my fucking firewall, now I got a fucking virus I can't even delete until I do some very good research towards it, because not even Adaware or any of those other programs could even check it out.
9837179	9844322	FU2, whoever was spreading a fucking rumor about my family and stuff, that someone said that one of our family members hate each other, you know how much
9845183	9849084	The pain that is for the family if someone ever hears that type of shit.
9850324	9853445	It hurts, a lot of tears have been going through that type of issue.
9855366	9859127	But luckily everything is solved and whoever said that type of shit should be killed.
9859147	9860927	Most likely, honestly.
9861708	9871970	FU2 being broke as hell because I spent a lot of money and now I owe like some people for the tournament since that's what some people say like the tournament got rigged over prizes.
9872791	9873731	Get the fuck over it.
9874750	9879813	and a few to losing a shitload of money on Friday at Thunder Valley Casino on Blackjack.
9880734	9881594	That was me last week.
9883415	9884256	Except not Blackjack.
9885857	9890540	Well, in the fact, yeah, I lost fucking 90 bucks over fucking Blackjack itself.
9891800	9893721	Some people can't even play fucking Blackjack pretty well.
9893741	9895462	They hit them when they're not supposed to hit.
9896707	9900169	Okay, if you see a six on the field, you're not supposed to fucking hit.
9900569	9903870	You're supposed to leave it to stay because they know the dealer is in trouble.
9904451	9905771	You hit and they give you 21.
9906011	9906952	You get fucked over.
9907332	9907972	Thanks a lot.
9909273	9912574	And since it is a three-hour show, I want to say to be continued.
9913495	9917837	My angst will never... Alright, alright.
9919958	9925300	Alright, let's move on to the next segment, which would be the chatroom FUs.
9928566	9948467	starting it off with MPQ in order of severity F you to the laggy broadcast F you to myself for inadvertently reformatting my hard drive twice in a week F you to my parents for losing the wireless network password and F you to my little sister for drawing on my laptop with a permanent marker dope
9950017	9957545	DarkKnight says, I think this might be a running FU, but FU to Valentine's Day and being broke and single and having to work on Valentine's Day.
9958847	9970079	Zaku says, FU to being worried about getting work, FU to Valentine's Day for being so discriminating to singles, and FU to having to wait until I'm employed so that I can buy the Bomani hardware I desire.
9971514	9973616	Illusion says F you to Valentine's Day.
9973756	9978539	Okay, I've got two girls that were in love with me, but they tell me this after they get a boyfriend.
9978559	9979120	What the fuck?
9979500	9985985	Anyway, I'm going to drown my Valentine's sorrow in a big tub of chocolate ice cream and multiple viewings of When Harry Met Sally.
9988927	9999474	VXJasonXV and Rychan, since they're together in the same place right now, you know, they said, I guess we could say F you to anyone in advance that F you's Valentine's Day.
10003129	10004350	Ouch, it's a clarin war there.
10005971	10011893	RPGKing7 says, if you do get this FU, an FU to all the employers that won't hire me.
10012013	10016075	I'm desperate for a job, but not male gigolo desperate.
10017416	10021298	And an FU to losing all my PlayStation 2 data, and to Valentine's Day.
10025219	10030642	StepEdOff1215 says, FU to constantly being broke and never being able to get anything I want.
10033255	10039882	and Lama Juice says, F you to Red Octane for losing my order for my metal pad that I waited the two months for.
10041624	10045569	And to Microsoft, because my Xbox isn't reading discs anymore.
10049433	10052376	And Dork says, F you to Valentine's Day and girls.
10052556	10054078	Insert frowny face here.
10055353	10061356	Oh, I think that was a bit of a recurring theme there tonight, the FU to Valentine's Day.
10061816	10062016	Yes?
10062256	10065377	Hugs to DK, because that's not cool.
10065597	10065857	Oh, well.
10065957	10066578	What, just him?
10068118	10068699	I know, I know.
10068719	10071200	A lot of people are sad about Valentine's Day, though.
10071900	10073100	Okay, hugs to you, too, then.
10073460	10074161	There, better?
10074641	10074901	Much.
10075221	10075521	Okay.
10076522	10076822	All right.
10078803	10079383	Let's see.
10079503	10081064	When the hell is that you're watching, Loki?
10081084	10083705	It looks like some public access production of Superman.
10083725	10084205	What is this?
10085546	10086666	It's the world's finest.
10086766	10092868	It's a fan-made trailer for a movie that doesn't exist.
10094309	10094649	I don't know.
10096150	10098810	Where do people get the time to do that, seriously?
10099351	10104212	I mean, I guess, then again, this is coming from a guy who co-hosts a three-hour internet show dedicated to video games.
10104973	10108894	Well, this guy's actually trying to get himself, you know, work.
10109614	10112395	It's a director that does the stuff, and he's done the same ones.
10112415	10114856	He did another one called Batman Dead End, which was...
10116027	10117888	Batman vs. Alien vs. Predator.
10118268	10118928	It's a little short.
10119028	10120309	It was really well done.
10120649	10126291	That was the one that was really cool in the beginning, and then when it was Predator-fied, I was like, this is gay.
10128132	10132434	They did another one called Grayson, too, which is supposed to be like Robin stuff.
10132554	10133354	It looks cool.
10133534	10135275	I mean, they have pretty cool people.
10136956	10138396	It's better than your average fan film.
10138436	10139077	Let's just put that one.
10139537	10139997	But anyways, yeah.
10142717	10143277	Interesting.
10143397	10144358	Where can you download that?
10144838	10146359	Is that like an Ain't It Cool News thing?
10147159	10150601	I believe TheForce.net has links to these.
10150821	10154983	They have like a fan film link for like other stuff.
10155183	10164427	You can also get some weird Matrix ones too, but like another one that's pretty cool is Matrix Run Program, I think is the name of that one.
10164847	10166248	That was pretty well done too.
10168464	10177910	So this director's trying to find work, so what he does is he wastes tons of money making these fake-ass trailers for movies so that internet nerds can get big boners over them.
10177970	10178490	Is that correct?
10178830	10179591	Except explicit.
10180912	10181532	Exactly.
10183673	10183993	Alright.
10185374	10185875	Interesting.
10186335	10191238	Alright, we're going to take a quick break, and then when we come back, we're going to wrap things up.
10191818	10193879	And please keep your boners secured at all times.
10194300	10194460	Yep.
10194780	10197542	And then there might be a few other surprises when we come back from break.
10197562	10197802	We'll see.
10199363	10199923	But no boners.
10200364	10201625	So, yes, Loki.
10202246	10208232	I mean, these would, I mean, obviously they're not theatrical quality, but I could definitely see this being like a TV movie or something.
10208252	10210634	They really should let this guy make movies.
10211215	10212617	Because I think they'd be pretty decent.
10212797	10215460	I mean, they'd be better than like, you know, Lois and Clark and stuff.
10216761	10218583	I don't think they should let this guy ever make a movie.
10220391	10226215	They let the guy that made, what was it, Uwe Boll or whatever his name is Okay, they let him make movies, why not this guy?
10226515	10246669	Because I would rather Uwe Boll make movies than this guy Because if this guy actually gets a deal and actually gets to make a movie Every freaking person on the internet will be turning out crap trying to imitate this So sorry dude, but I hope it doesn't work No comments to that, Loki?
10247779	10249802	That was completely and utterly retarded.
10250444	10251025	Your idea.
10251145	10251666	I'm sorry.
10253208	10253789	Ah, suck it.
10253869	10255031	Alright, we're going to go to a break.
10255813	10256313	We'll be back.
10256654	10259459	I thought we could do some disco tunes in this break, so we'll be back after this.
10319106	10319502	Thanks for watching!
10356738	10363101	I am gonna stand my ground, nothing in the world's gonna bring me down.
10363361	10370765	Hear me yell and hear me roar, I am something that you can't ignore.
10371185	10379089	I am here for all of us, I am this and we're all that we want.
10382289	10383550	DJ Ranma S, Actdeft
10410531	10415475	Gaming Radio, so uncensored, uncensored.
10440928	10445452	and even Tom Brokaw could get a job with us.
10445612	10446973	Orange Lounge Radio.
10450295	10452657	We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio.
10454218	10455299	About to wrap stuff up.
10455900	10464086	But you know, when we get towards the end of the show and we're running out of things to talk about, we always turn to the DDR community to find us some inspiration.
10464526	10468910	And of course, we like to head on over to the biggest DDR site out there,
10469454	10476716	TheDDRFreak.com And we like to find ourselves the DDR Freak Post of the Week.
10476796	10479237	So we're going to look at our DDR Chit Chat Post of the Week.
10485799	10487319	It was actually Slim Pickens this week.
10487360	10490040	There was really not a whole lot of newbie posts.
10490100	10492681	I mean, there was some, but nothing that hilarious.
10492721	10494982	So this was hard for me to make a determination.
10495002	10496922	But I did decide on this post here.
10497743	10498503	This is a post...
10499315	10505658	and it's called American Songs Are Wrecking DDR.
10506238	10507059	And the post goes like this.
10507759	10513122	Whose idea was it to put songs made by Cher and Madonna in DDR?
10513722	10516443	Unless you're a housewife, these songs gotta go.
10517744	10522326	They didn't put Max Period in Extreme US and I didn't think they were making DDR anymore.
10523038	10523799	I got a question.
10543669	10546691	Doesn't really matter if a song is like 300 beats p.m.
10546751	10547172	or more.
10547192	10555578	Because honestly, everyone who complains about this wants a Max song in it or Paranoia Survivor, Paranoia Survivor Max into any of the U.S.
10555598	10556199	releases.
10556939	10563724	Of course, everyone knows there's no Paranoia Survivor or Survivor Max in like Vulture Mix or the New York Stream series.
10564024	10568668	Hell, Paranoia Survivor and Survivor Max are just sped up versions of the other song.
10569208	10569649	Woo!
10569749	10571050	Paranoia Survivor and woo!
10571090	10572391	Paranoia Survivor Max!
10573180	10575221	which is a sped up version of the song.
10576401	10577961	Wow, that took a lot of work there.
10578981	10579902	See, that's what's sad.
10580322	10586883	People, you know, they probably look at these people playing SimFiles and they're like, hey, they like Max 600, it's just sped up Max 300.
10587864	10589404	Let's do that with Paranoia Survivor.
10589424	10591105	We have two songs for the price of one.
10592505	10593125	Exactly.
10594325	10600947	I don't know about you guys, but I think DDR is all about fun and trying to play Sakura heavy on a homepad is not fun.
10602253	10622852	Dancing around to Cher and Madonna, fun I mean, I don't mind about the song list, but some people just have to get a grip that a mix is not going to have all ten footers Rob, that's just the gay in you, saying that Hey, I like a lot of songs in DDR, not just the gay ones
10626700	10627620	Angel, your thoughts.
10627641	10629082	Do you have any thoughts on this one?
10629522	10629682	No?
10629762	10630343	She's shaking her head.
10631304	10631584	Okay.
10632685	10633926	Instead, she's giving me candy.
10633966	10634947	Ooh, that's a very good thing.
10635007	10635607	I like candy.
10635868	10637129	Candy's a good way to make me happy.
10637409	10639230	These little, like, they look like Pringles, but they're not.
10639251	10640311	They're little chocolate chip things.
10640772	10641152	Swoops?
10641232	10641813	Is that what they're called?
10642413	10643935	Yeah, I mean, yeah.
10644135	10653323	Like, related to my question, like, would anybody buy a mix that had 70 paranoias and 10 maxes all in just one package?
10653443	10653663	Yeah.
10655563	10656343	Yes, I might.
10657744	10664025	Because honestly... Seriously, why don't we release a home mix?
10664085	10665325	These are the songs we'll put in it.
10665345	10671707	We'll put Max Period, Paranoia Survivor Max, the Max 300 mix from Ultramix 2.
10672127	10672507	You know what?
10672547	10672927	Fuck it.
10672967	10678528	We'll just license a whole bunch of Nine Inch Nails and Crystal Method and all these really fast groups that do fast songs.
10678548	10682109	We'll license all their tracks and we'll put it in a home mix and we'll call...
10682987	10686370	Good fucking luck, Mix, playing this on your fucking homepad.
10687871	10694557	Or they could just do, infuse the song like everybody, does it be my style, Max Dinosaur or 1, 2, 3, 4, Max 300.
10694877	10700241	And then we'll call it, I hope you own a fucking Cobalt Flux, Mix.
10700481	10703084	Seriously, because that's the only way you're going to pass any of this shit.
10704365	10705846	Or DDR Controller, Mix.
10706767	10708068	Button, Button Revolution.
10708328	10709289	Rape, Rape Revolution.
10710189	10710850	How rapey that is.
10711235	10712916	or America's Beatmania.
10716278	10717639	There you go.
10718240	10721382	You guys that wanted a Beatmania USA, there you go.
10721422	10725344	They're just going to release a DDR mix and have nothing but 10s and 11s in it.
10725484	10727025	Yeah, they'll have 11-footers in it now.
10727265	10728946	And they'll call it Beatmania USA.
10729387	10729807	There it is.
10730868	10731568	Problem solved.
10733329	10733709	In a way.
10737068	10741352	Anyway, I think that's going to do it for tonight's episode of Orange Lounge Radio.
10742132	10745275	So now we're going to go around and get everybody's final thought.
10746415	10747856	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
10768969	10772712	and I would urge you to read through the instructions on our website.
10772732	10778856	If that's one of you, if you mark that answer, read through the instructions on our website under the Orange Lounge Radio To Go edition page.
10778956	10779816	It's really easy.
10780236	10784879	All you got to do is download a program called iPotter and you can get this at what?
10784960	10790483	It's just iPotter.sourceforge.net or even just put it into like Google, do a search for it.
10790823	10796307	It's really easy to find and then it gives you like a window in there where you put in a URL just like a web browser.
10796667	10797568	Put in our URL.
10797668	10798849	It is super, super easy.
10798989	10804593	Again, you do not need an iPod or any type of portable MP3 device to listen to the show.
10804653	10809516	They only call it a podcast because it sounds cute and iPods happen to be popular.
10809896	10810997	You don't need one.
10811337	10811637	Loki.
10812278	10817281	I did find one of the songs that could be on that, you know, good fucking luck mix.
10818582	10819583	Berserker, Reality.
10824166	10825067	What the fuck?
10826019	10831202	And sadly enough, that is the same file that you've found on BomaniStyle.com.
10831262	10834224	I've seen a lot of realities, I just don't download them.
10834324	10836566	You know what, and we'll just let DM Ashura do all the music.
10840148	10848433	And then, you know what, DM Ashura will do all the music, and then, who's that kid that does all the crazy-ass Oni steps?
10848593	10848754	He's
10849892	10850292	NakedHotTubbing
10880310	10881491	Explicit, your final thought.
10881972	10885655	I survived the anti-boner Lent so far.
10886156	10886576	So far.
10886596	10889199	So don't send me any more porn or anything like that.
10889379	10890420	And what is your email address?
10891141	10891321	Huh?
10892001	10892822	What is your email address?
10893483	10898588	Explicitalpha at yahoo.com Just look up his profile on DDR3.
10899128	10899989	Angel, your final thought.
10900830	10904273	Need more time in a week to play Final Fantasy XI.
10904293	10904533	Yeah.
10904854	10905014	Yeah.
10906894	10910997	My final thought is... I don't want to go back to work tomorrow.
10911057	10915220	And tomorrow's Valentine's Day and it's going to suck because everybody's going to have flowers and shit.
10915260	10916281	And I don't have that stuff.
10916942	10917742	Loki, your final thought.
10919804	10921585	I know I'm clicking and I don't care.
10923767	10929651	No, my final thought is... I don't want to have to return this fucking battery.
10930492	10931152	Sucks.
10931773	10931152	$200.
10934815	10936236	And the final word of the show...
10936823	10938704	I'm going to give the final word of the show to Loki.
10938944	10940665	Loki, one word to sum it all up tonight.
10943686	10944147	Bacon!
10945667	10950530	That does it for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio Live.

11045042	11048463	Drop them Nikes off your ass before I blast you, mother f***er.
11049096	11052738	Drop them Nikes off your ass before I blast you, mother****.
11054039	11056601	I used to be a stuck-up white boy, faking the funk.
11057041	11057661	Bump that.
