Orange Lounge Radio To Go Edition week of February 7th, 2005.

00:05.000 --> 00:09.000
And now, the Orange Lounge Radio To Go Edition.

00:09.000 --> 00:16.000
Your internet radio home for discussion on rhythm and music gaming, and all the news on video games that don't suck.

00:16.000 --> 00:21.000
And now, here are your hosts, DarkSakura, Skye, and Loki.

00:21.000 --> 00:25.000
Hello again everybody, and welcome back to our podcast!

00:25.000 --> 00:27.000
Thanks a bunch for subscribing.

00:27.000 --> 00:33.240
My name is Rob Roberts, you might know me as Sky. Joining me as always, awesome co-hosts, we love them,

00:33.240 --> 00:41.240
say hello to Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers. Hi. Hi. How are you? I'm not gonna do it. Save it for the

00:41.240 --> 00:47.320
three hour show. All right. www.orangelaunchradio.com, by the way, we're a part of that website,

00:47.320 --> 00:51.080
we could do a three hour show every Sunday night over there. It's tons of fun, and then we have all

00:51.080 --> 00:56.360
the spin-off programming too. But the podcast is something else we bring to you, to talk about

00:56.360 --> 00:58.960
video games that don't suck.

00:58.960 --> 01:02.000
And here's another host that doesn't suck, Loki!

01:02.000 --> 01:03.000
Hi.

01:03.000 --> 01:04.000
Hello.

01:04.000 --> 01:08.780
Um, hope you guys enjoyed the Super Bowl, or as we call it, the Stupid Bowl, or as one

01:08.780 --> 01:11.840
of our listeners called it on Sunday Night Show, the Super Bowl.

01:11.840 --> 01:14.440
That was pretty great.

01:14.440 --> 01:18.080
You know what, nothing against you guys that are into the Super Bowl, but it's just not

01:18.080 --> 01:19.640
for us, really.

01:19.640 --> 01:24.600
And you know what, neither are really football-based video games, or basketball games, or any of

01:24.600 --> 01:25.600
that stuff.

01:25.600 --> 01:30.040
sports video games that you find that you actually enjoy Dark Sakura?

01:30.040 --> 01:31.440
Tecmo Bowl.

01:31.440 --> 01:33.680
Tecmo Bowl for NES, absolutely.

01:33.680 --> 01:37.720
And High Impact for SNES.

01:37.720 --> 01:42.680
My favorites would probably be two old school 8-bit Nintendo games,

01:42.680 --> 01:45.600
Ice Hockey and Blades of Steel.

01:45.600 --> 01:47.600
I went through this whole hockey phase.

01:47.600 --> 01:52.440
Actually, I was kind of impressed with the ESPN game that came out on Xbox.

01:52.440 --> 01:54.080
Because it's pretty...

01:54.080 --> 01:55.760
It looks like you're watching TV.

01:55.760 --> 01:56.760
It's pretty.

01:56.760 --> 02:00.560
I don't know, I just, I feel like, I think we've talked about this on the three hour

02:00.560 --> 02:05.080
show before, but to play a sports game, I feel like I should be outside actually playing

02:05.080 --> 02:06.440
the sport.

02:06.440 --> 02:07.440
That's just me though.

02:07.440 --> 02:10.480
I like sports entertainment games, like Raw and SmackDown.

02:10.480 --> 02:12.440
Yeah, cause that's stuff I would do.

02:12.440 --> 02:13.440
Just for the creative wrestler.

02:13.440 --> 02:14.440
Cause I'm a big baby.

02:14.440 --> 02:15.680
Cause we made the Macho Man.

02:15.680 --> 02:17.640
Loki, your thoughts on sports games?

02:17.640 --> 02:23.900
I don't play sports games, unless you consider, you know, BMX XXX a sports game.

02:23.900 --> 02:24.900
Why not?

02:24.900 --> 02:26.340
They just don't do it for me.

02:26.340 --> 02:31.460
I don't like watching sports normally, and I don't like playing sports games.

02:31.460 --> 02:33.380
I just dislike sports.

02:33.380 --> 02:34.380
I don't know.

02:34.380 --> 02:38.380
Well, if you guys want to talk about sports games, there's some other podcasts out there

02:38.380 --> 02:39.380
where they do talk about it.

02:39.380 --> 02:42.060
Now, if there's anything wrong with that, just not our cup of tea.

02:42.060 --> 02:44.820
We want to talk about other types of video games.

02:44.820 --> 02:46.980
For instance, the games we've been playing this week.

02:46.980 --> 02:49.780
Jamie, what kind of games have you been playing this week?

02:49.780 --> 02:50.780
Guitar Freaks.

02:50.780 --> 02:51.780
Ah, yes.

02:51.780 --> 02:55.380
I yes we broke it back and I played some poppin nine

02:55.380 --> 02:59.340
oh you've had quite a bimani filled week a music gaming week haven't you a couple

02:59.340 --> 02:59.800
days

02:59.800 --> 03:03.360
yeah every time I go home Dan's either playing

03:03.360 --> 03:08.160
well he's now playing snake eater I thought he beat Metal Gear

03:08.160 --> 03:11.220
solid three no no yeah he didn't bother home

03:11.220 --> 03:14.300
bass playing that now but I've been coming home to playing

03:14.300 --> 03:17.420
a guitar freaks it's been funny isn't so cute

03:17.420 --> 03:20.540
so but but at least it's both Konami games

03:20.540 --> 03:26.240
And then you go from like US Konami to Japanese Konami and I don't know and then I was playing

03:27.480 --> 03:33.760
Of course, it's so it's so weird to hear you talk about playing Final Fantasy 11. That was me and Loki's thing. I

03:35.000 --> 03:38.240
Don't play it that much like an hour a day

03:39.560 --> 03:45.800
All right, whatever school that's how it starts. That's how it starts. I have a life me, too

03:45.800 --> 03:49.120
I go to school and the gym and I work I

03:49.120 --> 03:58.680
I work and I drink you exercise your liquor I do you know what I work out I

03:58.680 --> 04:02.120
pick up that heavy bottle of liquor and I pick it up and bring it towards my

04:02.120 --> 04:05.120
mouth it's a little fleck forget it who am I trying to kid

04:05.120 --> 04:11.120
look you would even playing this week other than Final Fantasy not really much

04:11.120 --> 04:17.400
I played some flash games last night that were weird kind of came over the

04:17.400 --> 04:21.000
website it was just um like they had one it was drunken walk where you had to

04:21.000 --> 04:25.520
like make sure your characters balanced otherwise he falls over and passes out

04:25.520 --> 04:31.400
there was another one that was called wheel and it was like it was some weird

04:31.400 --> 04:34.240
flash games there's a lot of really interesting stuff out there that people

04:34.240 --> 04:40.280
make and there's just a lot of fun so mainly that stuff mostly Final Fantasy

04:40.280 --> 04:45.960
though alright as far as the games I've been playing this week a DDR angel who's

04:45.960 --> 04:50.280
a common guest we have on the Sunday show. She's heard me constantly bitching about no

04:50.280 --> 04:56.240
good games out on DS right now. So she decided to bring over Mr. Driller on the DS so I could

04:56.240 --> 05:00.620
check it out because she's like, hey, there's this new game. And I played it a little bit

05:00.620 --> 05:03.900
before like maybe for like five minutes, but I didn't really get to play it a little more

05:03.900 --> 05:11.840
in depth until earlier. And it's kind of neat. I like it. You know, it's the same Mr. Driller

05:11.840 --> 05:15.340
game. There's really not a whole lot that the DS adds to it. It's just like, oh, it's

05:15.340 --> 05:20.140
another freaking mr. driller game but mr. driller is kind of one of those games

05:20.140 --> 05:23.980
where like I really want to get good at it because I like puzzle games a lot

05:23.980 --> 05:29.100
like some of my favorite games or puzzle games like Tetris super puzzle fighter

05:29.100 --> 05:33.940
2 turbo and all that I want to be good at mr. driller but the strategy isn't

05:33.940 --> 05:37.940
clicking for me like I can't figure out how to get good at that game I just I

05:37.940 --> 05:42.420
keep hammering I want to drill down as fast as possible because I think that's

05:42.420 --> 05:45.820
way to do it but it's you have to think about where the bricks are gonna fall

05:45.820 --> 05:52.020
and my brain isn't developed yet it's too tough but yeah mr. driller DS it's

05:52.020 --> 05:56.180
just freaking mr. driller but I guess one cool thing about it is it's got the

05:56.180 --> 05:59.780
whole you know wireless multiplayer thing so it's kind of neat kind of nice

05:59.780 --> 06:03.860
to see DS's do that who was telling me about the DS picked oh chat thing that's

06:03.860 --> 06:06.980
being developed I hadn't read anything on that Loki or yours mentioning

06:06.980 --> 06:10.420
something about this what did you read well it's not really a picked oh chat

06:10.420 --> 06:17.180
thing. It's some, um, god I can't remember which game it is. There's a game coming out

06:17.180 --> 06:21.720
where, while you're playing the game, I think it's even like a puzzle game or something

06:21.720 --> 06:26.060
like that, where you're playing the game and there'll be a little icon or whatever that'll

06:26.060 --> 06:31.960
come up if someone's within distance of you that's in PictoChat and you can quit out your

06:31.960 --> 06:38.800
game to go to PictoChat or use, you know, invite them into a multiplayer game. So it

06:38.800 --> 06:42.640
it was kind of neat and I wished that they would add that to, you know, future games

06:42.640 --> 06:47.120
because it's really something that's lacking. I mean, I think it'd be cool, like, what they

06:47.120 --> 06:54.440
should do is, like, with Xbox online, where you can see, or Xbox Live, where you can see

06:54.440 --> 06:57.800
who's online, what game they're playing, that type of thing. They should have that when

06:57.800 --> 07:00.800
you're walking around the DS, where it's just like, okay, this person's playing this game,

07:00.800 --> 07:04.240
oh, this person's in PictoChat, you know, that kind of thing. And you can, like, send

07:04.240 --> 07:08.740
little PMs to them or whatever to say, hey, you know, come chat with me or hey, I want

07:08.740 --> 07:11.120
to play a multiplayer game with you or something like that.

07:11.120 --> 07:13.840
That's what they need.

07:13.840 --> 07:19.220
I absolutely agree the DS needed something like this from the start and a lot of Xbox

07:19.220 --> 07:22.720
Live games when Xbox Live was first out didn't have this either and they really needed it

07:22.720 --> 07:28.320
because you know, I want to know if certain people around are playing the DS, who's in

07:28.320 --> 07:32.820
PictoChat, what room, it's like when they first advertise the DS, do you remember that

07:32.820 --> 07:36.600
movie they were showing at E3 and they showed like the kid was reading a book

07:36.600 --> 07:39.800
upstairs and the mom was sending a message on PictoChat saying like come

07:39.800 --> 07:45.120
down to dinner well how would the kid ever know that if your DS is off you're

07:45.120 --> 07:48.440
not in PictoChat the thing doesn't beep to let you know somebody's trying to

07:48.440 --> 07:51.920
send you a PictoChat message or anything like that it's like the system now

07:51.920 --> 07:57.040
granted when you see things at E3 it's stuff that's in development so you know

07:57.040 --> 08:00.520
maybe that thing hadn't been finalized or whatever but at least it needs

08:00.520 --> 08:04.640
something where I think you were saying this to me early at least it could show

08:04.640 --> 08:08.480
you like who around you if people are playing DS's around you like when you if

08:08.480 --> 08:11.420
you look at the webcam for one of our Sunday night shows here we do an orange

08:11.420 --> 08:14.640
on radio there's usually five people here in studio all playing DS's there

08:14.640 --> 08:19.000
should be a way to see what game each person around you's playing honestly ds

08:19.000 --> 08:24.080
needs something like that so possibly though something that will be coming out

08:24.080 --> 08:28.060
later something that they might have at e3 who knows I mean I'm sure they haven't

08:28.060 --> 08:33.260
you know they might have you know overlooked it early on but definitely not

08:33.260 --> 08:35.900
overlooked it completely I'm sure there's something out there maybe

08:35.900 --> 08:42.300
there's a reason why they couldn't do that I don't know we shall see all right

08:42.300 --> 08:46.060
I want to talk about some gaming news going on we got a launch date for PSP in

08:46.060 --> 08:53.020
North America it's gonna launch March 24th guess how much it's gonna cost 250

08:53.020 --> 08:57.340
or as they would have you want to know 249 of course that doesn't figure in the

08:57.340 --> 09:01.420
so you really are gonna be paying 250 plus for this and it's gonna come with a

09:01.420 --> 09:08.660
32 megabyte memory stick including oh there will be 24 games that are

09:08.660 --> 09:12.900
confirmed for the launch which is probably more games than the DS has out

09:12.900 --> 09:16.940
now so that's one that's one thing the PSP is gonna have going out the gate so

09:16.940 --> 09:23.740
if I were Nintendo I'd be a little worried right now but PSP has a firm

09:23.740 --> 09:29.620
date set now here's the interesting thing there may be another I think or

09:29.620 --> 09:35.160
what was this deal here it's um okay I'm sorry also in the pack headphones with a

09:35.160 --> 09:41.520
remote control battery pack AC adapter case cleaning cloth game demo so you're

09:41.520 --> 09:46.180
not getting any actual games that are plugged in but if you're one of the

09:46.180 --> 09:52.760
first million people to buy a PSP you get a free copy of spider-man 2 the

09:52.760 --> 10:00.480
movie just for your PSP on UMD format of course. So you have a copy of Spider-Man 2 to take

10:00.480 --> 10:05.020
with you everywhere you go as if you didn't know in the movie on DVD already. I mean talk

10:05.020 --> 10:11.000
about a horde movie. I mean you can get Spider-Man 2 in the checkout lane at the grocery store.

10:11.000 --> 10:15.940
That's how like everywhere this movie is and of course it's a huge movie. It's a very audience

10:15.940 --> 10:20.680
friendly movie. I like the movie. A lot of people like the movie but damn talk about

10:20.680 --> 10:24.840
over saturation I don't know if that's you know that doesn't make me that

10:24.840 --> 10:28.400
excited to be one of the first million people is like ooh I can have spider-man

10:28.400 --> 10:35.240
2 again in my pocket to watch again I'm just wondering if they fixed the

10:35.240 --> 10:39.920
amazing game launcher function I mentioned this one more time for our

10:39.920 --> 10:43.840
listeners the game launcher function where if you twist it your game shoots

10:43.840 --> 10:53.880
out so you can hold up a bank with the game launcher really no Rob okay maybe

10:53.880 --> 11:01.560
not now one of the things that I have to laugh about this is the memory stick

11:01.560 --> 11:09.480
thing with that I'm sure people are gonna have Linux on this in no time

11:09.480 --> 11:13.480
people will install Linux in a shoe box

11:13.480 --> 11:18.080
anything with a monitor they will try to install Linux on did we talk about this

11:18.080 --> 11:21.160
last week I don't remember what show was we talked about Linux being installed on

11:21.160 --> 11:22.040
the iPod

11:22.040 --> 11:25.280
and I'm just like they will install Linux on anything

11:25.280 --> 11:29.080
anything called Linux on an iPod I have seen

11:29.080 --> 11:32.480
they're working on Linux on the DS right now honestly

11:32.480 --> 11:35.680
I kid you not it's so

11:35.680 --> 11:46.960
crazy do they have Linux on Commodore 64 that rocks that's so rocks all right

11:46.960 --> 11:50.840
quick gaming no I want to get to dark sacros advice column for the week I want

11:50.840 --> 11:54.200
to give a quick gaming you know this is a series I played for a little bit I

11:54.200 --> 11:57.640
didn't finish this game though but it was a it was a good game it kind of felt

11:57.640 --> 11:59.920
like watching a movie sometimes though I didn't have a lot of control over the

11:59.920 --> 12:06.920
Zeno Saga, it's getting a sequel. It came out a while ago, it came out, it felt like it came out quite a while ago.

12:06.920 --> 12:17.920
It's just now getting a sequel, February 15th, very soon, Zeno Saga Part 2, developed by Monolith Soft, same studio that did Episode 1.

12:17.920 --> 12:25.920
And Zeno Saga 2 will have more than 100 skills for characters, including Last Revenge, Overload, Double Power.

12:25.920 --> 12:29.880
new to the battle system are double attacks and that would be like a team-up mode where

12:29.880 --> 12:35.760
you do a team-up and you do one big assault so Xenosaga 2. Anybody, did you ever play

12:35.760 --> 12:40.320
the Xenosaga games at all Jamie? No. You didn't just really get into the series? No. I thought

12:40.320 --> 12:46.080
you were the one that turned, I know one of my old, that was, one of my old buddies made

12:46.080 --> 12:48.520
me play it, actually play it, but I thought you were the one that first told me about

12:48.520 --> 12:53.560
it. That was Miklotov, who was into Xenosaga 2. Maybe, I don't know. I don't know where

12:53.560 --> 13:00.320
I did remember, however, the hint to the existence of Xenogears in Final Fantasy 7, when Cloud's

13:00.320 --> 13:10.320
in the hospital, and he's mumbling incoherently, and he says, Xenogias, Z-E-N-O dot dot dot,

13:10.320 --> 13:11.320
G-I-A-S.

13:11.320 --> 13:16.880
All sorts of little inside jokes in those Squeenix games.

13:16.880 --> 13:21.220
Alright, um, we here at Orange Honors Radio, not only do we want to make your lives, I'm

13:21.220 --> 13:25.120
sorry, not only do we want to talk about what's going on in the video game world, but we want

13:25.120 --> 13:26.840
to make your lives better.

13:26.840 --> 13:32.320
Therefore, the usually angsty Dark Sacra has her little advice column for you guys, and

13:32.320 --> 13:36.760
we call it Dark Sacra's Advice Column.

13:36.760 --> 13:40.160
Jamie, what did you bring for us this week?

13:40.160 --> 13:44.080
Today's bit of advice is how to win a bar fight.

13:44.080 --> 13:50.320
State laws stipulate that you may use sufficient force to stop an attack, but you may not deliver

13:50.320 --> 13:53.760
any sort of punitive retribution to your attacker.

13:53.760 --> 13:56.320
Remembering this may save you a costly trip to the court.

13:56.320 --> 14:00.720
Basically, in English, you can stop someone from attacking you but can't budge them back.

14:00.720 --> 14:01.720
Aww.

14:01.720 --> 14:02.720
Can't get your pay back.

14:02.720 --> 14:03.720
Where's the fun in that bar fight?

14:03.720 --> 14:05.200
Eh, this is just how to win.

14:05.200 --> 14:06.560
What about breaking a bottle on their head?

14:06.560 --> 14:07.560
Does that count?

14:07.560 --> 14:11.840
If it's enough to stop them from hitting you again, sure.

14:11.840 --> 14:15.520
Anyway, here's four easy steps to win a bar fight.

14:15.520 --> 14:19.200
Number one, attack the most sensitive areas of your opponent.

14:19.200 --> 14:21.200
Eyes, groin, knee, and throat.

14:21.200 --> 14:22.120
Stay close.

14:22.120 --> 14:25.460
If your opponent is large, he will need room to hit you.

14:25.460 --> 14:28.520
Two, attack repeatedly and be efficient.

14:28.520 --> 14:32.320
Make fast, repeated blows to any or all sensitive areas.

14:32.320 --> 14:36.280
I want a nice, clean, efficient bar fight.

14:36.280 --> 14:40.080
That means kicking the balls repeatedly.

14:40.080 --> 14:41.240
Repeatedly.

14:41.240 --> 14:42.560
Just repeatedly punch the groin.

14:42.560 --> 14:43.680
Number three.

14:43.680 --> 14:45.960
If necessary, use a weapon.

14:45.960 --> 14:49.600
Choices include telephones, pens, bottles, books, beer

14:49.600 --> 14:52.560
mugs, coffee cups, and keys.

14:52.560 --> 14:53.760
Four.

14:53.760 --> 14:55.640
Protect yourself from additional attackers

14:55.640 --> 14:57.520
by fighting with your back too, but not up

14:57.520 --> 15:00.480
against a corner or a wall.

15:00.480 --> 15:02.160
Very interesting.

15:02.160 --> 15:04.640
I also have a little bit more to add to that.

15:04.640 --> 15:05.160
OK.

15:05.160 --> 15:07.120
It's a move that they taught us in my karate class.

15:07.120 --> 15:07.400
OK.

15:07.400 --> 15:09.480
If you happen to be picked up and have the ever-loving chick

15:09.480 --> 15:12.820
squeezed out of you all you have to do is get your hands free and hit them on

15:12.820 --> 15:17.260
the side of the head with your palm I would demonstrate but our listeners

15:17.260 --> 15:20.120
will not see that kind of like how when you do something stupid your mom smacks

15:20.120 --> 15:23.320
you upside the head and goes what were you thinking oh no it's more of like a

15:23.320 --> 15:28.320
tank like with both hands both hands on the side because it will disorient them

15:28.320 --> 15:34.140
oh very interesting thought thank you Jamie for helping to better our lives so

15:34.140 --> 15:38.240
yes next next next time you're in a bar fight you'll win that way next time you

15:38.240 --> 15:43.200
you guys go to the bar and you get in that argument, DSPSP, DSPSP, and then it erupts

15:43.200 --> 15:45.680
into a fight, now you know, kicking the groin repeatedly.

15:45.680 --> 15:48.300
Gouge out the eyes. Exactly.

15:48.300 --> 15:55.460
Make sure that you hit people with your elbow. Let's talk about gaming and movies. Don't

15:55.460 --> 16:01.240
we love it when video games cross over and become movies? Okay, maybe not, but it doesn't

16:01.240 --> 16:07.760
stop it from happening. Guess what game's coming next? Of course, you knew this was

16:07.760 --> 16:12.640
gonna happen variety is reporting that Microsoft has quietly put the finishing

16:12.640 --> 16:17.600
touches on a million-dollar deal with the guy that wrote the movie 28 days

16:17.600 --> 16:26.940
later to adapt halo the movie oh first of all now I like 28 days later that was

16:26.940 --> 16:31.760
a good movie I don't know it was a good zombie movie weird ending but you know

16:31.760 --> 16:35.240
It was a good movie.

16:35.240 --> 16:36.240
We...

16:36.240 --> 16:38.980
Halo movie.

16:38.980 --> 16:41.520
We better not see what the Master Chief looks like.

16:41.520 --> 16:43.680
28 Days Later, a good zombie movie.

16:43.680 --> 16:45.560
Evil Dead, a good zombie movie.

16:45.560 --> 16:47.040
28 Days Later...

16:47.040 --> 16:50.780
What the hell was that?

16:50.780 --> 16:52.640
That was more like what it is.

16:52.640 --> 16:59.520
It's like, you know, we want to kind of do a Dawn of the Dead, but not quite Dawn of

16:59.520 --> 17:00.960
the Dead.

17:00.960 --> 17:03.640
make them run because that's a little different you know they don't normally

17:03.640 --> 17:13.160
run and then we'll just go ahead and make a really shitty ending here's the

17:13.160 --> 17:16.760
weird thing about Halo is that in many aspects it already is a movie so I don't

17:16.760 --> 17:20.760
kind of understand the but of course a lot of the Resident Evil games had a

17:20.760 --> 17:23.520
very movie feel to them and they made a game they made a movie out of that

17:23.520 --> 17:28.840
anyway but I mean yeah I mean they made two movies out of Resident Evil but the

17:28.840 --> 17:34.840
The only movie that should ever be made, and I'm sure Jamie's gonna agree with me on this,

17:34.840 --> 17:36.440
is Red vs. Blue the movie.

17:36.440 --> 17:37.440
Yes!

17:37.440 --> 17:38.440
We need Red vs. Blue the movie.

17:38.440 --> 17:43.100
That is the only way that this movie will be any good, because Red vs. Blue, they could

17:43.100 --> 17:47.460
honestly put that on TV, and that would be entertaining.

17:47.460 --> 17:52.360
I was gonna say Castlevania the movie, which we've been bitching about for years, and no,

17:52.360 --> 17:54.720
Van Helsing was not Castlevania the movie.

17:54.720 --> 17:55.720
I'm sorry.

17:55.720 --> 18:01.000
needs to be like Dracula X version anyway I want to mention this though

18:01.000 --> 18:05.440
because Microsoft thinks that they've learned from mistakes like Resident Evil

18:05.440 --> 18:09.680
Apocalypse and Alone in the Dark which were hated by critics this is what

18:09.680 --> 18:14.200
they've decided here what they're gonna do they're going to develop their own

18:14.200 --> 18:18.560
script and then shop it to studios once it's satisfied so Microsoft's developing

18:18.560 --> 18:24.760
this script internally so could that be good we'll see I think that that's good

18:24.760 --> 18:29.760
because at least then it will stay Halo and not like Hollywood Halo.

18:29.760 --> 18:33.760
Well, it's easy not to fuck up their movie. Don't get into that one guy that made those three movies.

18:33.760 --> 18:39.760
I mean, you know, he's the one that's, you know, crapping out these really shitty scripts.

18:39.760 --> 18:42.760
Actually, I believe Resident Evil and Mortal Kombat were done by one guy,

18:42.760 --> 18:47.760
and then Alone in the Dark and, um, House of the Dead were done by another guy.

18:47.760 --> 18:53.760
Okay, House of the Dead, Alone in the Dark guy, that's the guy that should not touch any scripts for anything ever.

18:53.760 --> 18:57.200
never ever ever touch anything okay

18:57.200 --> 19:01.040
it scares me enough that the guy that you know directed Catwoman

19:01.040 --> 19:04.120
is going to be doing Akira that scares the shit out of me

19:04.120 --> 19:07.560
yes he will be doing the live-action Akira what

19:07.560 --> 19:11.280
yes so look forward to that piece of shit coming out

19:11.280 --> 19:15.000
somewhere

19:15.000 --> 19:19.560
inside I am crying and watch him fully base it off of the anime which would

19:19.560 --> 19:23.400
absolutely suck they'd need to base it off of the manga for it to be any good

19:23.400 --> 19:27.180
hear that I realize you kind of work in the industry a little bit so you pick up

19:27.180 --> 19:30.480
on things like that but where did you hear something like that it was on any

19:30.480 --> 19:34.260
cool news like a while ago they have because they had a whole big thing about

19:34.260 --> 19:39.900
it and how they're like oh god why you know but I don't know don't get me wrong

19:39.900 --> 19:43.740
I love ain't it cool news calm but I hope that's another one of their fake

19:43.740 --> 19:48.940
ass rumors I really do there are some other ones there was um oh god I want to

19:48.940 --> 19:55.220
say who was the James Cameron's gonna be picking up battle angel which is gonna

19:55.220 --> 20:00.020
be good now that would be good James Cameron doing that so I can see that

20:00.020 --> 20:05.220
happening pretty being pretty sweet of course you have the live-action a on

20:05.220 --> 20:10.220
flux movie coming out which should be pretty good I imagine I have issues with

20:10.220 --> 20:15.620
Charlize Theron though but I'll say that for another show anyway moving on

20:15.620 --> 20:18.180
Uh, speaking of movies, now let's go the other way.

20:18.180 --> 20:20.720
Let's talk about movies going into games.

20:20.720 --> 20:22.580
This was a big story this week.

20:22.580 --> 20:29.100
EA is developing a game based on an old movie, The Godfather.

20:29.100 --> 20:34.580
They're doing a Godfather game, and this made news this week because I believe Marlon Brando

20:34.580 --> 20:39.060
was quoted in an interview a long time ago, or somehow an article came up about him this

20:39.060 --> 20:40.060
week.

20:40.060 --> 20:44.360
No, he wasn't quoted, but somebody had said about him that he initially refused the part

20:44.360 --> 20:51.720
he played in the movie The Godfather, he refused that because he felt that the movie glorified

20:51.720 --> 20:58.520
the Mafia. And it turns out he actually has loaned his voice talents to this game. Yes,

20:58.520 --> 21:03.240
he's dead, he did it before he died. This game's been in production for quite some time.

21:03.240 --> 21:08.520
Marlon Brando actually loaned his voice to the game. And what is this game going to be

21:08.520 --> 21:14.280
doing? Glorifying the Mafia, you betcha. And I hear that he's going to be releasing a new

21:14.280 --> 21:19.680
album with Tupac coming out later on cuz you know Elvis and Elvis yeah because

21:19.680 --> 21:25.480
they make new music even after they're dead so anyways you're just thinking

21:25.480 --> 21:32.560
well Robert Duvall and James Caan Robert Duvall and James Caan will also be

21:32.560 --> 21:35.960
loaning their voices to this so that should be interesting and EA is gonna

21:35.960 --> 21:41.320
have a big gala premiere of the Godfather February 10th and guess what

21:41.320 --> 21:44.200
it's gonna be first shown to the public in the New York City neighborhood

21:44.200 --> 21:50.240
of Little Italy. Isn't that cute? Alright, one more news story for you guys tonight.

21:50.240 --> 21:55.800
I'm excited about this. I really am. I saved the best for last. Capcom is going to be doing

21:55.800 --> 22:01.100
a couple new compilations. And you know how they did the Mega Man anniversary collection

22:01.100 --> 22:05.240
last year, which was such a good idea. Oh, it was such a good idea. I was very pleased

22:05.240 --> 22:08.640
with that game. Did you play the Mega Man compilation at all?

22:08.640 --> 22:10.880
I did, but the timing was way off.

22:12.320 --> 22:14.400
Did you play it on GameCube or PS2?

22:14.800 --> 22:17.360
I think that we had Dan try it out on PS2.

22:17.360 --> 22:17.860
Hm.

22:18.080 --> 22:23.360
Because, on the NES, he can do, um, Quick Man's level without using the time stopper.

22:24.160 --> 22:26.080
And, uh, he couldn't do it on the PS2.

22:26.080 --> 22:28.240
But he came home and did it again on the NES.

22:28.560 --> 22:29.200
Interesting.

22:30.240 --> 22:30.740
Hm.

22:31.680 --> 22:32.320
We'll see.

22:32.960 --> 22:36.960
Um, but Mega Man, they're also going to be doing a Mega Man X collection,

22:36.960 --> 22:39.960
because the Mega Man Anniversary Collection did so well, they're going to do a compilation

22:39.960 --> 22:41.700
of all the Mega Man X games.

22:41.700 --> 22:43.440
This really shouldn't be a surprise to anyone.

22:43.440 --> 22:46.720
I think this is kind of a foregone conclusion, but that's pretty cool.

22:46.720 --> 22:50.640
They actually released this little trailer that just, they haven't said exactly what

22:50.640 --> 22:54.560
games are going to be in it, but they did catch one unlockable that's going to be in

22:54.560 --> 22:55.560
the game.

22:55.560 --> 22:59.200
Mega Man Battle and Chase will be an unlockable that's in the Mega Man X.

22:59.200 --> 23:00.200
That's pretty obscure.

23:00.200 --> 23:01.200
That's cool.

23:01.200 --> 23:04.160
Yeah, but I mean if you think about it, the two arcade games that they put in the Mega

23:04.160 --> 23:10.460
collection to begin with were also pretty obscure. Where's Mega Man Soccer? I want that

23:10.460 --> 23:17.500
in a collection. What? You know what they need? Is fucking Mega Man Legends 3, okay?

23:17.500 --> 23:22.100
I love those games. Even a Mega Man Legends online would be awesome, because that could

23:22.100 --> 23:28.660
totally, you know, become an RPG, even though it was like all weird and everything. Capcom,

23:28.660 --> 23:34.100
Capcom, by the way, is also going to be developing a Capcom Classics collection, and it's going

23:34.100 --> 23:39.360
to be basically this compilation of classic games from Capcom.

23:39.360 --> 23:43.380
They haven't said what games are going to be in it, but they're hinting that it will

23:43.380 --> 23:49.940
include old school favorites, such as those that have been seen in the Capcom Generations

23:49.940 --> 23:53.940
compilations that were released in Japan for the Saturn and PlayStation.

23:53.940 --> 23:55.180
I actually have one of those.

23:55.180 --> 23:59.740
I have the Makai Mora set, which is Ghouls and Ghosts, Ghosts and Goblins.

23:59.740 --> 24:02.060
Ooh. See now, I think those are the kinds of things.

24:02.060 --> 24:05.660
And might I say, Capcom,

24:05.660 --> 24:09.460
pretty pretty pretty please, I have a couple requests.

24:09.460 --> 24:13.180
Bionic Commando. Strider.

24:13.180 --> 24:18.300
Magic Sword. Strider.

24:18.300 --> 24:21.100
And Quiz and Dragons. How cool would that be?

24:21.100 --> 24:24.420
Quiz and Dragons. Okay, I'm kidding on the last one.

24:24.420 --> 24:39.420
The thing about Strider is that they released it as part of the Strider 2, which is funny because they even made the changes, because we have the Japanese version and the US version because my fiance is a big Strider fiend.

24:39.420 --> 24:49.420
For any of our listeners who ever frequented any of the Strider sites, he actually had Neo Strider's own back in the day, which is one of the first ones out there.

24:49.420 --> 24:55.060
Wow. Um, but on the first one where he's swinging he sort of goes ha ha ha ha the

24:55.060 --> 24:59.900
whole time. He doesn't do that in the US one and they fully did the US one when they

24:59.900 --> 25:08.180
brought that out. We need, um, we need, uh, Captain Commando. Yes. We need Captain

25:08.180 --> 25:13.580
Commando. Yes we do. And we need the D&D games. And I want Super Slam Masters

25:13.580 --> 25:18.180
again. Super Slam. Well Captain Commando did come out on the PlayStation. It was

25:18.180 --> 25:23.700
3 player. I don't remember that coming out of the PlayStation. It did. I have it. It's

25:23.700 --> 25:28.300
awesome. Alright, we'll see. Oh, I have high hopes for this. I hope it's as good as those

25:28.300 --> 25:31.820
Midway collections. Seriously, those are some of the best collections I've played. And I

25:31.820 --> 25:36.320
hope it's not like the Nintendo collections where they put 20, I'm sorry, they put one

25:36.320 --> 25:41.020
game and released it for 20 bucks on a Game Boy Advance cart. Especially when it's games

25:41.020 --> 25:46.180
that were unlockable in other games, i.e. Metroid. Shame. I mean, a couple of them were

25:46.180 --> 25:51.740
like Zelda was cool but seriously 20 bucks for Donkey Kong I don't think so

25:51.740 --> 25:56.020
that's not the way to do these compilations Midway knows how to do the

25:56.020 --> 25:59.700
compilations I hope Capcom takes the page out of their book as you could just

25:59.700 --> 26:03.340
play Animal Crossing get all those games that's like Animal Crossing it's like a

26:03.340 --> 26:09.860
$240 value or it's one way to think about it all right that's gonna do it

26:09.860 --> 26:14.340
for this podcast Jamie any parting words for our listeners parting words

26:14.340 --> 26:21.420
