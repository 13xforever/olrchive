281081	283142	February the 6th, 2005.
284242	292964	You're tuned in to the B-Money scene's most apathetic, when it comes to football anyway, radio station of all things B-Money.
293544	295725	My name is Rob Roberts, you might know me as Sky.
296265	303587	Joining me, as always, are my awesome co-hosts in this corner, the happiest bunny on the farm, Miss Jamie Summers, a.k.a.
303627	308428	DarkSakura.
308468	310389	You know that's coming out on DVD this Tuesday.
312836	317219	If anybody is out there maybe thinking that, God damn, Jamie's beating that joke in the ground.
317259	321783	She's just, you know, trying to help those folks out, sell some DVDs.
322303	326747	Because hearing that sound 20 times a show, doesn't that make you want to buy the movie?
330710	333472	Also joining us, say hello to TechMassaLoki.
335553	337355	You're knee-deep in silence right now.
337635	340757	And I'm knee-deep in not turning the mic on.
340797	341338	There you go.
342987	343948	What did you say before that?
343968	349412	You're knee-deep in... I'm such a dumb-up-ass.
351113	351914	Dumb-up-ass.
352774	354676	Hilarious, those of you that were listening last week.
355476	356657	He's knee-deep in hot poo.
357478	358579	I finished the monitor, though.
360100	360560	For what?
360620	361641	Nobody knows what you're talking about.
361661	362502	I finished the monitor.
362662	364964	The monitor for the PC I'm building.
365284	365664	Okay.
365984	367986	Because I mounted a monitor inside of a case.
369319	370579	We have to show this on the webcam.
370619	370840	I will.
371040	372200	Because it's very dorky.
372900	374821	And our listeners love that dorky stuff.
375241	379322	I gotta find the goddamn strap though for this because it doesn't have a handle.
381262	382083	It's around here somewhere.
382443	382983	In my mess.
383563	387064	Alright, also joining us tonight, say hello to our special guest.
387604	388865	Say hello to DDR Angel!
390905	391265	Hi!
391785	397227	I have chicken and stuff and... Yeah, my stomach's gonna be full in about five minutes.
397267	397627	Leave me alone.
398470	400391	My stomach is still full from yesterday.
400491	401171	Oh my god.
401371	402971	I'm going to talk about that in a little bit.
404392	407333	You had stuff, and it was good.
408293	413634	I had stuff upon stuff, covered in stuff, and then flavored with extra stuff.
413754	414595	It was beautiful.
415495	416615	It was much stuff.
417035	417635	Extreme.
417776	418636	No, wait, that was bad.
420016	420816	Max stuff.
421156	421557	Oh, hi.
422097	424017	Say hello also to special guest Bug.
424858	425118	Hi.
425958	426458	How you doing?
427205	428166	I'm doing good.
428386	429166	I like saying your name.
429226	429527	Bug!
431148	433970	It's Dad's birthday, so it wasn't my dad.
433990	434070	What?
434090	436932	We're having a hard time hearing you, so... It's Dad's birthday.
437172	437292	Oh.
437772	437872	Oh.
438473	439073	No, my dad.
439313	439614	Your dad.
439634	439814	No, no, no.
439834	440754	My dad.
440835	441615	It was Rib's day then.
443216	443777	Well, that's good.
443797	445598	I, too, am full of meaty goodness.
447819	449360	Alright, we'll have to talk about fun days.
449761	452863	We'll have to talk about Bomani news, all that stuff going on right now.
453823	454905	in the Mimani world.
454946	456268	But first, we're going to do a break.
456449	457591	And tonight, you guys...
458892	461753	2DX Red, the soundtrack, it came out this week.
462133	472675	And I'll tell you what, you take another listen to some of these songs when it's on the actual soundtrack and the levels of some instruments are up a little and down, it's all cleaner and it's nice and crisp and clear.
473015	476475	When you listen to this on the soundtrack, a lot of these songs are just awesome.
476495	479256	So we're going to be playing some stuff from the official soundtrack tonight.
479656	483416	We're going to start it off with a song called Injection of Love.
483496	484277	I love this song.
484337	486097	This is the one that has the F-word in it.
486577	487317	So listen for it.
487377	489278	We played this either last week or the week before.
489598	495201	But listen to the soundtrack version and some more 2DX Red music tonight.
495881	496661	And we'll be back.
496681	501403	Injection of Love also makes it sound like... I know, Injection of Love makes it sound like fucking to begin with, doesn't it?
501423	502844	It makes it sound like it's full of meaty goodness as well.
502904	504304	You lie down on that bed!
504344	506165	I'm gonna inject you with love!
506505	507526	Dumbass.
509587	512268	Are you ready to get injected with love?
513648	514889	Ejected or injected?
519842	520643	That about says it.
520763	522726	Yep, it's definitely time for Orange Lounge Radio.
522746	523668	We'll be back after this.

991917	1010330	Hi-ho, Kermit the Frog here, informing you that today's broadcast of Orange Lounge Radio is brought to you by the letter V, the letter A, and the number 59.
1010430	1015854	Can you tell me how to get, how to get to Sesame Street?
1017216	1017756	Orange Lounge Radio
1037503	1041884	and it's, forgive me if I pronounce this wrong, it's just Agiha or something like that?
1042144	1043285	A-G-E-H-A.
1043645	1044025	Agiha.
1044445	1044785	Agiha.
1045145	1045485	I think so.
1046146	1050267	Before that, the song Sphere from 2DX11, pretty cool song.
1050987	1057689	EVO66, which by the way, is by the same group that did North from 2DX4 style.
1057709	1058569	You guys remember that song?
1058629	1066231	It was like very, I don't know, like Renaissance Fair Rave type song.
1067446	1069868	I really don't know how to explain that song.
1070769	1072430	Wait, let me play a little bit of North.
1072490	1075572	Here's a little clip of North from 2DX4 style.
1078054	1085800	It's kind of like happy.
1090163	1091184	Like flute or something.
1091284	1093446	And then they go from that to this.
1101300	1102841	I guess this is a little more Ravish.
1102881	1103261	I don't know.
1108643	1108963	I don't know.
1109143	1111204	How do you get from point A to point B?
1111284	1112085	I have no idea.
1112905	1113185	All right.
1114145	1118387	And then starting that set off, Injection of Love, the song where she says, Fook me.
1120508	1122229	What the fook is going on over there, you guys?
1123329	1124330	We're just fooking around.
1124570	1124870	Okay.
1124950	1125770	What are you fooking doing?
1125970	1126731	What the fook is that?
1126791	1127571	Just showing a picture.
1128997	1130378	Oh, okay.
1131459	1132739	That's a pretty fucking good picture.
1132879	1133660	Alright, anyway.
1134620	1135721	Let the joke die.
1136201	1136461	Alright.
1137702	1141044	We're going to start off tonight's show as we do every week, playing a little bit of How was your week?
1141084	1141664	How was your day?
1141744	1144946	Your chance to catch up with us and what we've been doing.
1145306	1146627	It's better than LiveJournal, really.
1146967	1147688	Jamie, how was your week?
1147728	1150109	How was your day?
1150189	1151890	My week was pretty okay.
1152751	1153931	It was... Work was great.
1154572	1155432	I love my job now.
1156673	1156953	You know...
1157850	1160712	I made a comment to my boss that I had no job stress.
1161032	1162513	He was like, what was this business?
1162533	1167075	I was like, no, there's a difference between having a lot of work to do and having emotional stress.
1167576	1168876	And I don't have any of that at my job now.
1169097	1170097	So it's been really great.
1170697	1171938	I can go to work happy.
1172058	1173019	I can leave happy.
1173639	1175100	I can be happy all day at work.
1175400	1176361	How many people can say that?
1176541	1178702	When I got my last promotion, I felt the exact same way.
1178762	1185486	I went from feeling useless to feeling good about what I did.
1186444	1188425	I literally felt useless in my old position.
1188545	1191166	In my old position I had the evil VP, who I hope dies.
1191566	1192807	I liked everybody I worked with.
1193487	1198449	I don't think I've really worked with any bad people unless they were people who weren't there very long.
1198729	1199789	I enjoyed my entire team.
1200029	1207312	Yeah, I've had the fortunacy of working with good people, but that doesn't always mean that I was doing the best kind of work, you know what I mean?
1207594	1208616	My work is really easy.
1208656	1214186	It's all spreadsheets and computer stuff that I don't have to really... I can listen to my music.
1214247	1217192	As long as I can listen to my music and do my work, I'm a happy bunny.
1217292	1217853	And what do you do?
1217893	1219236	You listen to Phantom of the Opera while you work?
1219376	1219937	Dude, I was.
1220769	1224290	and one of my co-workers came up and goes, oh my god, this is awesome.
1224610	1226571	So which track are you on?
1226591	1229932	She tried to figure out what track I was listening to by the playlist.
1230112	1236195	I want to know, is it timed so that when you walk in the door... When I'm driving, yes.
1237015	1240116	That's how I wake up in the morning is by putting in my Phantom of the Opera soundtrack.
1241806	1243927	That should be somebody's alarm in the morning.
1244227	1249668	Like, can you imagine, you know, you're resting all peacefully and then the sun's coming up and then your CD player kicks in and it's at max volume.
1250108	1252829	Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo.
1253089	1254129	That would be awesome.
1254309	1255689	I should do that to Dan one day.
1255709	1257110	You just have to be where falling chandeliers.
1259110	1261151	Yeah, it's so loud the chandelier falls.
1261231	1261771	Ha, ha, ha.
1261851	1262111	Anyway.
1262991	1264771	In our case, it'd be the halogen lamp falls over.
1267812	1269152	It turns out it was the cat after all.
1269192	1271373	She's, you know, the cat
1271960	1272760	Your cat's playing?
1273180	1274401	The cat's the bandit.
1274441	1276802	How do you tune your cats?
1277682	1277982	Kick her.
1281923	1282304	I don't know.
1282324	1285245	That's where I wake up to cat in the face.
1285805	1286445	Meow!
1287365	1288206	Mom, feed me!
1288986	1289166	Meow!
1292912	1294113	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1319993	1324475	Are you pissed off that they never released any new ones on PlayStation?
1324615	1326576	Dan is, but we're looking for the second Append now.
1326916	1327197	Oh, okay.
1327677	1330578	But I finally, finally passed Liar Liar all the way through.
1331439	1331719	Yay.
1332659	1334100	I'm not really all that great at Guitar Freaks.
1335201	1338362	But I can pass Carnival Day like it's, you know, nothing.
1339303	1340663	That was one of the bonus tracks from 5th.
1342264	1344505	Why will they not put Guitar Freaks 5?
1345145	1347326	It's Guitar Freaks 5 isn't out for home, right?
1348027	1348467	Yeah, it is.
1349571	1351593	I thought Guitar Freak's fourth... It's the one labeled Guitarra.
1353154	1355175	Guitar Freak's fifth, Germania fourth.
1358618	1360279	I thought that they stopped with fourth third.
1360499	1362000	I think it's fourth third is where they stop.
1362040	1363241	I'm sure somebody in the chat... Okay, no, you're right.
1363301	1365163	It's three seconds and then fourth third.
1365183	1365663	Fourth third.
1365743	1368325	And then five, four is the one they really need to do.
1368645	1371107	Like, all of my favorite Guitar Freak songs were on fifth.
1371127	1371888	Yeah.
1371948	1372628	And then six.
1372668	1374370	And there's, you know, there's good ones as the series goes on.
1374390	1377052	It depends on you, though, on the fourth third.
1377172	1377352	Well...
1377754	1379175	and Liar Liar and Dynamite.
1379235	1391864	I'm not saying there's bad songs, but I'm just saying all the songs I want to play, what would make me get a guitar, little controller and all that stuff, because I would never get a drum set at home type thing.
1391904	1396387	It's just, I just, I really suck at Drum Mania and it's not a game I want to get better at.
1398354	1399895	Good for you, but not for me.
1399915	1401396	I got it pretty cheap, too.
1401436	1403877	But Guitar Freaks is kind of fun.
1403917	1406018	What I love about Guitar Freaks is the cheesy side of me.
1406038	1409560	I love how you get bonus points for when you do the little... With the whale.
1409620	1411461	Like, you know, lift the guitar up like you're a rock star.
1412141	1413062	Okay, I'm lame, whatever.
1413322	1415323	I shoot myself in the head like a rock star.
1417084	1421766	But, um... No, uh... What else?
1422167	1422227	Um...
1423812	1426754	mainly, you know, and I did school, doing a project for my art class.
1426814	1431337	It's supposed to be my midterm, so we're starting it now, because we're not going to have a test, we're just going to do a project.
1432278	1452032	And I have to take, I told you about this earlier, but you take a picture from a magazine, you have to redo it as a pencil contour drawing, and then redo it as a ink contour, then do an ink wash version of the picture, Conti crayon, oil pastel, watercolor, um...
1455071	1456432	There's another one that I'm forgetting.
1456532	1458112	Charcoal, which I hate charcoal.
1458913	1461114	So you have to do the same painting over and over.
1461194	1461394	Yeah.
1462134	1464515	And so far, I'm almost done with my charcoal one.
1464835	1466356	My ContiCran one's almost done.
1466416	1472799	That leaves me the ink wash, oil pastel, watercolor, and then the random one.
1472839	1475120	You basically reinvent the picture.
1476480	1478721	I am a horrible, horrible artist.
1478781	1479982	I will never take an art class.
1480282	1484704	It's the one thing I was not meant to do ever in my life was take an art class.
1487229	1489750	I'm helping with the other thing that I brought today.
1490210	1496795	The other thing that my house has been taking up with has been Dracula X on the Turbo Duo.
1498256	1502939	And I have, for later on today, brought that.
1503119	1504379	Okay, we'll talk about that later.
1504399	1506181	I've been doing lots of retro gaming in the house.
1506201	1507541	We've been playing Tengen Tetris.
1507922	1508222	Why?
1508302	1510764	It sucked.
1510824	1511424	It sucked.
1511784	1512845	No, it was awesome.
1513125	1516367	I did not get the big deal with Tank and Tetris.
1516407	1518769	Tank and Tetris has cooperative play.
1519209	1520390	Okay, I'll give you that.
1520490	1522211	It does have the better multiplayer.
1522491	1526294	But the music was better, and the Nintendo and the graphics were better, and it was cutesier.
1526634	1528075	It was Nintendo-fied!
1528475	1531598	Tank and Tetris had cooperative play, which makes it all worth it.
1531678	1534840	But Tank and Tetris, outside of that, was really ghetto.
1536048	1537049	It was still Tink and Tetris.
1537069	1538911	It looked like Commodore 64 Tetris.
1539071	1539612	No, worse.
1539852	1541574	It looked like Atari 800 Tetris.
1541854	1543256	Well, it was made by Atari.
1543796	1546879	Yeah, and it looked like they took a direct port from the Atari 800.
1547480	1555148	I mean, it's still cool because it's like, ooh, the game that was banned in a court of law type thing.
1555488	1556669	They can't make this game anymore.
1557370	1558972	For that reason, it's cool, but still...
1559796	1561958	It's not the best Tetris game, in my opinion.
1562439	1564521	The one on Game Boy was really the greatest Tetris game.
1564561	1566603	It's still one of the shining stars of my collection.
1568505	1569246	Understandable.
1569967	1571768	What about your cartridge of Custer's Revenge?
1572449	1574191	We don't have a cartridge of Custer's Revenge.
1574211	1576153	You need one.
1576173	1577194	We've got a ROM of it.
1578215	1579136	Actually, I take that back.
1579616	1581038	We have a ROM chip of it.
1582380	1592905	Okay, the ROM chip is cool, but as far as the ROM on the computer goes, almost everybody that's ever emulated Atari 2600 on their PC, the first thing they go and download is Custer's Revenge.
1592985	1593686	And X-Man.
1594726	1597027	Custer's Revenge, X-Man, and Adventure.
1597808	1598348	Or E.T.
1599568	1599869	E.T.
1599929	1600429	is horrible.
1600469	1601469	I actually own E.T.
1601589	1604251	Because people usually remember Adventure and E.T.
1604291	1605451	for two very different reasons.
1606172	1606312	E.T.
1606372	1607692	is the worst game ever.
1608032	1611254	And Adventure, probably, for most people, the best game ever that they played.
1612074	1613034	or Yars' Revenge.
1613454	1614295	Pac-Man.
1615415	1617516	Pac-Man was the second worst game ever.
1618256	1620557	Isn't that interesting that Yars' Revenge and E.T.
1620617	1621817	had a lot of the same staff?
1623078	1624958	And one's the worst game ever and one's the best game ever?
1625638	1627899	I went to the panel that they did at Classic Gaming Expo.
1628779	1630240	Oh, I should have gone to that.
1630280	1631920	Was that this year or was that last year?
1631940	1633081	That was this past year.
1633201	1638042	Did Battlezone and quite a number of other games.
1638102	1638562	Defender.
1639683	1640303	That was pretty cool.
1642981	1646344	But yesterday I hung out with Iguana Girl.
1646985	1647626	We went shopping.
1648747	1649147	Had dinner.
1650589	1653411	I burned a bunch, I mean, made pictures of a bunch of DVDs.
1655433	1657796	I thought she was going to say she burned a bunch of forest or something.
1658877	1659778	I burned a bunch of people.
1661419	1664382	And played more of the Final Fantasy game.
1665424	1668366	Well, you at the mall, I can imagine you wanting to burn down some people.
1668506	1670828	Did you walk by any girls that were shopping together?
1670848	1671628	Oh, my God.
1671868	1673389	Oh, my God, you're going to look so cute in that.
1673489	1675551	The mall was busy, like Christmas busy.
1675651	1676491	It was insane.
1677312	1680094	It was everyone teaming up for Super Bowl.
1681014	1681414	Damn.
1682055	1683356	More of the S word.
1683476	1684156	Here's what it is.
1684196	1684857	The stupid bowl.
1685377	1686798	Here's what it is.
1686838	1691401	Since the stupid bowl was going on today, and all the women knew they'd have to be in the kitchen today,
1691840	1693000	They went to the mall yesterday.
1693361	1694641	Okay, you know what?
1694881	1697282	This is, you know, the zeros.
1700203	1700983	I'm just kidding.
1701003	1703104	People better get some, you know, liberation going on.
1703784	1706005	Maybe men make their own damn nachos and get their own damn beer.
1707586	1708646	I'm just kidding with you.
1710007	1711167	I like getting y'all riled up.
1711447	1714708	I like burning a fire on ya.
1714768	1715408	Rob.
1715428	1715669	Rob.
1716529	1716749	Rob.
1717149	1717329	Rob.
1717349	1717529	Rob.
1717789	1717949	Rob.
1723052	1723592	Are you done?
1724213	1724573	Rob!
1725353	1725873	Are you done?
1725893	1725973	Rob!
1725993	1726794	Are you done?
1727974	1728254	What?
1729015	1729255	Hi.
1729535	1729755	Hi.
1731316	1731976	You weren't high.
1733036	1733657	You are high.
1734917	1735297	Anything else?
1735357	1736338	I'm high on life.
1737038	1737578	Anything else?
1738038	1738298	No.
1738419	1739919	Let's keep the show going, people!
1740780	1744041	Oh, other than stupid cookie woman, but I'm bringing that up during the FU's.
1745296	1746276	Stupid Cookie Woman.
1746456	1748117	Reading about the Stupid Cookie Woman.
1748297	1749717	Alright, I'll have to hear about this later.
1749737	1753678	No, it's about the two girls who baked all the cookies for her neighborhood and then the one woman sued them.
1756539	1756879	Huh.
1757579	1759520	I will be discussing that later.
1760100	1761680	Can we talk about the Stupid Bowl for a minute?
1762000	1762360	Sure.
1762660	1763681	I hate it, but go ahead.
1765041	1768662	Well, I'm surprised we have this many people listening tonight with that whole thing going on.
1769002	1771823	But what is your grudge against the Stupid Bowl, Jamie?
1773363	1773503	It's
1775785	1777586	Like a bastardized version of rugby.
1779127	1781829	At least rugby has men getting bloody wearing shorts.
1784510	1785270	Big advantages there.
1787152	1788092	Real football is soccer.
1790073	1800059	And on top of that, it's just another excuse for millions and millions of Americans to sit on their lazy asses, drink beer, and scream obscenities at their TV.
1800179	1801540	How's that different from any other Sunday night?
1802037	1813146	Yeah, I was going to say, instead we encourage you to, we are encouraging our listeners to sit home, drink juice, and sit and listen to obscenities be screamed at them.
1815708	1818830	You know, if I were the one screaming the obscenities at them, that would be worthwhile.
1820251	1820892	What's stopping you?
1824574	1826056	I need a really big megaphone.
1843706	1844866	I'm sure his wife would have been happy.
1844887	1851149	Can you imagine Paul McCartney having a wardrobe malfunction where a ball falls out or something?
1851529	1852730	That's disgusting.
1852870	1854290	I seriously doubt it.
1854770	1857011	I would petition the FCC myself.
1857352	1864114	I bet you Saturday Night Live is going to get him next time and he's going to have a wardrobe malfunction like Janet where his shirt rips off or something.
1864534	1865355	That's disgusting.
1866175	1867055	Loki's shirt ripped off?
1867075	1867235	What?
1868316	1868556	Uh-oh.
1869997	1871057	You broke something, you fixed it.
1872538	1873278	My previous...
1873874	1874734	Well, are you done?
1875495	1875755	You done?
1876055	1876715	I guess so.
1878776	1879436	Well, are you done?
1880196	1880816	I guess so.
1884617	1884977	Fine.
1885718	1886478	I guess I'll go then.
1887018	1888679	You're done since you said you're done.
1889819	1890679	I just said I guess so.
1890699	1893640	I didn't say I was done.
1893740	1895681	See, this is my pet peeve about women.
1895701	1897641	They don't fucking come out and say yes or no.
1897821	1899582	They always have to go maybe.
1899782	1900382	Fine.
1900502	1901342	I'm done.
1904855	1905235	Speak!
1908137	1908477	Anyways.
1910038	1912800	I just fixed the monitor because it wasn't working.
1912820	1920945	And my previous assumption of there's two sets of cords going to the screen, and I thought one of them was for the standard composite inputs.
1920985	1925808	You have to set up your story because you can't assume that every... English for the technological illiterate.
1925828	1926688	I was getting there.
1926908	1927789	Alright, alright.
1927809	1928069	Shit.
1928990	1929490	Anyways.
1931538	1935881	It worked exactly like I thought, so when I unplugged something, it worked perfectly.
1936322	1939344	So, now the monitor works, and I'm happy.
1939884	1943907	But because I tried cutting something off of the Dremel tool, I accidentally grounded something up.
1944007	1948470	So anyways, the monitor thing, this is for that computer that I'm building that's inside of an Xbox.
1949110	1954994	The monitor itself is an old PlayStation 1 monitor, LCD thing, that's like 5 inch.
1955735	1958517	And right now we have the Turbo Duo on there, so...
1959349	1961190	Are we going to be able to play Final Fantasy XI on it?
1963792	1968896	You know, to be honest, I could do that, but not on that computer.
1968916	1970697	You're not going to be able to play Final Fantasy XI on that computer.
1970797	1971037	Nope!
1971778	1973079	That computer is way too weak.
1975220	1979703	You can play Final Fantasy on the emulator.
1980264	1980964	Final Fantasy III.
1981845	1982245	Or VI.
1982405	1982906	Hooray.
1984667	1986248	You can play Phantasy Star Online.
1989433	1990194	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
2009727	2016892	The rest of the week was me being sick and just playing a lot of Final Fantasy.
2016972	2021015	We went to the buffet yesterday and that was fun because I hadn't been there.
2021836	2024678	And what else?
2025498	2028140	Oh, that's pretty much it.
2028560	2034104	Just people quitting at my work now and that's funny because they're going to be screwed and I don't care.
2035846	2037607	Yeah, it's just that kind of thing.
2039144	2040065	That's all that happened to me.
2041226	2044189	Alrighty, let's hear from DDR Angel.
2044349	2044889	How was your week?
2044929	2045410	How was your day?
2046971	2047352	Not much.
2047432	2051356	Just a lot of school and homework and, you know, the usual stuff.
2051416	2054659	Working and... Running into creepy guys at fries on Tuesday nights?
2054959	2056240	Yes, running into you.
2057842	2059643	No, actually it was kind of funny.
2059864	2060204	I, um...
2060842	2071768	went over to Fry's on Tuesday and aside from watching 23rd Magus play DDR again because he always has to stop there for some reason just to show off or whatever.
2072248	2073168	Okay, not really show off.
2073769	2074149	Just play.
2075129	2082233	So I was looking for a new speaker set and just some other stuff that I needed and I ran into Bugged!
2083354	2083714	And that was fun.
2083734	2085395	Yes, and I recovered perfectly fine, thank you.
2086655	2087135	What did I do?
2088016	2088916	I did nothing!
2089237	2089957	You said you ran into me.
2090359	2091360	Yes, I did.
2091420	2092120	No, no, no, no, no.
2092140	2093622	That would be 23rd Magus running into you.
2093662	2094142	Puppy porn?
2094202	2094422	What?
2095843	2096484	I don't want to know.
2096564	2096904	Okay.
2097665	2098285	It's the puppy bowl.
2098325	2101228	Puppies don't have bowls?
2102268	2102989	Not much other than that.
2103049	2110975	I really wish that I could play Final Fantasy XI this week, but homework kind of got in the way and all that stuff.
2111416	2118441	So this week, hopefully, I will get things done probably tonight or tomorrow, and then I can play with everyone.
2118461	2118521	Yay!
2118862	2119222	Yay!
2121092	2121652	And that'd be it.
2122353	2123714	Be gentle when you play with all of us.
2127456	2127996	How was your week?
2128036	2128637	How was your day?
2128977	2131238	I ran into this creepy person at Fry's on Tuesday night.
2134580	2136261	I'm not creepy, I'm angelic.
2136481	2137302	I wasn't talking about you.
2137322	2139623	I was the other creepy one.
2139663	2140384	Yeah, he's creepy.
2141244	2141524	He was.
2143225	2145487	He gave me this weird eye like, damn, I know you.
2145947	2147628	I gave him the weird eye like, I do know you.
2148604	2153768	Well, I would call it something, but then... Yeah, never mind.
2154688	2156870	I'll just call it the eyebrow.
2160632	2162674	Anyway, other than that, how was your week and your day?
2163314	2166536	Uh, ended up in San Jose yesterday for a birthday party.
2167037	2169078	Lots of video games and other various games.
2169338	2170179	Yes, how'd that go?
2170359	2171460	That went pretty well.
2172140	2174882	And, uh, got back at like 2am, beat my brother home.
2175783	2176583	It was working.
2176963	2177224	Uh-huh.
2177664	2177904	Heh heh.
2179007	2182430	He was kind of surprised to see his big brother sitting at the computer in the kitchen when he walked in at 3am.
2183710	2184211	Can't blame him.
2184531	2187933	I'd be surprised too if somebody was sitting at the computer in my kitchen at 3am.
2188994	2190315	And, uh, let's see.
2191275	2192396	Picked up two video games today.
2193857	2202362	The toy liquidator store over at the outlets had buy one get one 50% off, so I got Civ 3 and Douglas Adams Titanic.
2203863	2205624	Two games I've really wanted to play for a long time.
2206565	2208086	Now that I can actually afford them,
2208530	2210991	I'm curious about Civ 3, like, I haven't really played it.
2211912	2213593	Oh, well, if you want to give it a test drive.
2213833	2215193	Yeah, I might have to try that out.
2216694	2223338	I heard that Civ 3 was a little more like Civ 1 than Civ 2 was, because Civ 2 was too much for me.
2223498	2226759	Like, I, oh my god, like, it's too complicated.
2227300	2229821	Civ 1's bad enough, but Civ 2 is like, oh my god.
2230181	2234623	But somebody told me that Civ 3 is a little easier, but I hope that's true.
2234923	2235924	Nothing beats Populous, though.
2237190	2241336	Populous was cool because you could drown people by just taking away all the land.
2242578	2245241	If you guys have never played Populous, check it out sometime.
2245642	2247164	Seriously.
2247725	2249547	I owned it on Super Nintendo, okay?
2249567	2251210	Yeah, it was out on the computer as well.
2253653	2255194	It was really a computer game, too.
2255214	2260075	It was one of those games that some genius decided they were going to port from PC to Super Nintendo.
2260435	2263796	Although the game really, really was not designed to be played on the console.
2264196	2265617	But you try it anyway.
2266757	2268158	And that's how it was on Super Nintendo.
2268478	2269518	The game was awesome.
2270678	2272059	Drowning your own people are the best.
2272239	2273599	My week's been pretty damn boring.
2274300	2278161	And Tuesday's going to be a very interesting day with the funeral.
2278861	2282082	A lot of people from the past life have come out of the woodwork.
2283437	2284177	That's tomorrow?
2284818	2285138	Tuesday.
2285258	2285678	Tuesday.
2286358	2287539	I... Well, yeah.
2287859	2288219	You work.
2288399	2289560	I'll talk to... Well, yeah, that.
2289600	2290080	There's that.
2290200	2293901	And, you know, I just... I don't like funerals.
2297123	2298883	I really, really don't, so... Yeah.
2298903	2299063	Yeah.
2300304	2302765	But other than that, well, it's pretty standard.
2303705	2304085	All right.
2305086	2305466	Fair enough.
2306436	2307197	My week and my day.
2307217	2307917	I guess it's my turn.
2308238	2309959	Okay, I want to expand on the buffet thing.
2309999	2313321	We went to Thunder Valley Casino, which is this little Indian casino.
2313341	2314062	Well, it's not really little.
2314082	2323388	It's this big Indian casino that is somewhere between here, where we are in Sacramento, and Reno, which is where all the gambling used to happen.
2323789	2329473	But now that they have this new Indian casino, that's where everybody in this area goes to gamble, and Reno is practically going bankrupt because of it.
2329853	2331455	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2351253	2356035	Like, I brought back one plate that had like this really good tortellini on it and coconut shrimp.
2358135	2359756	And I think my buddy Christopher put it best.
2359796	2362537	The coconut shrimp tasted like a Krispy Kreme donut.
2363377	2364277	It was so good.
2364957	2365838	And I love coconut shrimp.
2365878	2366818	I had so much coconut yesterday.
2366838	2368618	I had that and I had a coconut cream pie.
2369379	2370579	Sorry, am I making you guys hungry?
2370599	2370919	I'm sorry.
2371339	2372440	I ate so much.
2372540	2373100	I was so full.
2373540	2376821	And then I lost $75 in the casino.
2377581	2377961	Go me.
2378221	2378561	I rock.
2379182	2379302	So...
2381068	2382949	Loki, how long would you say it took me to lose $75?
2383710	2387032	About 10 minutes.
2387312	2392075	Because I play quarters and dollars.
2393716	2395277	I don't stick around for that nickel stuff.
2395317	2396138	That ain't gambling.
2397038	2398659	That's how you don't lose $75.
2398800	2401301	Because a buck gets you 20 plays.
2405882	2407703	Oh, well, see, no, no, no.
2407883	2414464	Because on nickel machines, this actually, you know what, we can relate this to Bomani because a lot of those nickel machines are built by Konami.
2414685	2417445	You may not know this, but Konami actually has a lot of these machines as well.
2418166	2422927	And the deal is that a lot of the nickel machines that are out there are actually video slot machines.
2423667	2426088	And the way they're built, they have five reels.
2427088	2430329	And when you put that, you can play them nine different ways.
2430808	2438733	It's like you could play it straight across, you could play it diagonally, bouncing around this way and that way, and making little mountains and valleys.
2439233	2444216	It's crazy, all the different line patterns that you can have when you play on a nickel slot machine.
2444577	2449540	So, if you want to play all nine ways on a nickel slot, you're really spending 50 cents a pull.
2451281	2452662	Yes, but you have nine chances to win.
2454603	2458045	But that's crap, because that stuff is programmed to only spit out so much money.
2458385	2459866	I hate playing nickel slots, to be honest.
2460367	2462528	There's actually more than five arrows, so it's better than pump butt.
2484096	2485036	Pretty mellow.
2485557	2486217	I didn't do a lot.
2486257	2487758	I was sick Wednesday.
2487778	2488578	I didn't go to work.
2488678	2490119	And so, you know, that's kind of a bummer.
2490179	2493861	But don't drink on weeknights, kids.
2493981	2494781	This is something I learned.
2494841	2495762	Don't drink on a weeknight.
2497022	2498023	Don't over-drink on a weeknight.
2498043	2499924	Yeah, don't over-drink on a weeknight.
2500064	2501144	Don't do it without a plan.
2501324	2505386	Don't take seven shots of straight-up rum on a weeknight within the scope of an hour.
2506967	2507267	You know?
2507947	2508208	Yes?
2509068	2509668	That would stop me.
2510949	2512029	Don't do that at any time.
2512650	2513110	Seriously?
2515020	2520621	If I ever do that again, I'm checking myself into AA or something, and I'm not into those 12-step programs.
2521042	2522662	I'm a one-step program kind of person.
2522742	2524803	I'm no more drinking on weeknights, period.
2524823	2526363	Step one, remove cap.
2526823	2529604	Step two, take shot glass.
2530244	2531844	That's your 12-step program.
2531864	2532384	Poor liquor.
2532745	2534085	Step four, drink.
2534205	2536145	Step five, fuck the other steps.
2539166	2541267	I have a two-step program over the tracks.
2541727	2542127	Brewery.
2544167	2544887	You live right near him.
2545267	2545448	Yes.
2545468	2547228	For those that don't know, you live near a brewery.
2547748	2548969	I don't even know that I live near a brewery.
2548989	2551350	I don't know how long I tell anyone else.
2551390	2552650	I've got to come out there sometime.
2552690	2554791	It's just weeknight, drive.
2554811	2556812	You can drive with someone.
2557112	2557752	I know, I will.
2558533	2559013	Someday.
2560153	2560693	Take the train.
2561614	2561934	Someday.
2563715	2564555	I guess that's it for now.
2564595	2566836	If I think of something else exciting, I'll tell you guys about it later.
2566876	2568436	But gambling was the highlight of my weekend.
2568476	2568656	What?
2572218	2572818	No, I didn't.
2574682	2576084	I was antisocial this weekend.
2576264	2577766	I was very antisocial this weekend.
2578607	2580849	That was kind of the theme of my whole week, was antisocialness.
2581230	2581610	That's all right.
2583303	2585224	All right, you guys are sick of hearing about us, I'm sure.
2585244	2585885	We're going to come back.
2585905	2586525	We're going to take a break.
2586545	2589828	We're going to come back, and we're going to talk about some Bomani news going on out there right now.
2589868	2597213	We've got some news on 2DX9 style going on, and we've got some news on Ultramix 2, kind of, sort of.
2597974	2603518	Even though the game's already out, we have some more news on Ultramix 2 that's all been developing throughout today, in fact.
2603758	2606300	No, no Song Pack 8 yet, and...
2608706	2610247	All sorts of other stuff that we can come up with.
2610307	2612749	Plus, Jamie has something she wants to share with you guys, too.
2613189	2620273	I'm not really sure how we're going to do this on air, how this is going to translate to radio, but you seem to have something already planned, Jamie, for our listeners.
2620573	2621033	Webcam.
2621534	2622874	And it's a follow-up to last week, right?
2622934	2623915	It is a follow-up to last week.
2623935	2625116	I'm glad you brought up the webcam.
2625316	2626696	www.orangeloungeradio.com
2627877	2628818	And you can see our webcam.
2628878	2630939	Also, don't forget to join our chat room while you're there.
2631399	2633020	And we are a fully interactive program.
2633060	2634521	Check out the Skype line while you're there as well.
2634541	2636922	Click on Interact With Us to find out more information about that.
2637382	2640924	We will open up the Skype line a little later in the show for you guys so you can interact with us.
2641645	2641985	Indeed.
2643046	2646888	Also, when we get back from this break, announcement.
2647668	2654132	Big, huge, Orange Launch Radio announcement that could change the future of everything as we know it.
2655633	2656413	We'll be back after this.
2658908	2660531	Yeah, somebody's going to be fired for good.
2660551	2661593	Donald Trump is swinging by.
2661713	2661973	All right.
2662935	2666702	More 2DX Red music in this break, starting it off with a little bit of Akira Yamaoka.
2666762	2667303	Thank you very much.
2667383	2667804	We'll be back.
2818012	2818633	S, Actdeft,
2845225	2847807	Thank you for watching!
2879637	2880657	Thank you for watching
2949221	2951244	Thanks for watching!
3070514	3071054	and many more.
3133554	3135375	From the Step Squad to Orange Lab, this PDR sucks!
3169918	3172740	We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio.
3172980	3175843	Hope you enjoyed that break of some 2DX Red music.
3176283	3179766	Now that the OST is out, you can really take a second look at a lot of those songs.
3181928	3187112	It really just shows you how much the quality of an MP3 or the quality of a rip can really affect...
3187672	3189152	The way you perceive a song.
3189232	3193693	For instance, what would be a song... Well, I would say EVO 66 was one of those songs.
3194374	3196154	We played that one a little bit earlier in the show.
3196534	3202815	That was one of those songs that when I heard the soundboard rip or the one from the game, I was just kind of like, oh, that sounds okay.
3203236	3207396	But then when I was listening to the soundtrack on it, I was like, oh, this is kind of groovy.
3207677	3209677	It really kind of thumps a lot more.
3209977	3212238	I guess because you get more of the bass and the fullness of the sound.
3212258	3213938	This is a really thumping song.
3214558	3223344	And considering I live too far away from any 2DX Red machines, so I haven't really gotten to play the actual machine, this is the only way I kind of get to live 2DX Red.
3223684	3225545	Where are they around here?
3225806	3232090	I think there might be one at Sviggle last I heard, but I know Arcade Infinity has one for sure.
3234211	3235352	Oh, you got them both.
3236255	3237056	So you could play them.
3238216	3240078	You want to play one side by side or something?
3241299	3243020	Play EVO 66.
3243140	3244921	Play a little clip of that one.
3244961	3246082	Just jump in the middle of the song.
3246102	3246643	Play a little bit.
3247623	3248504	What's down there at the bottom?
3248584	3248904	Techno.
3250465	3250785	Techno.
3250966	3251286	There it is.
3251886	3252767	Play a little clip of that.
3254388	3256790	See how it's kind of like...
3269849	3272850	I don't know.
3272870	3279532	Pause it for a minute.
3279592	3280913	Pause it for a minute.
3281013	3281453	Stop for a minute.
3281473	3283594	Okay, because you just played the soundtrack one side by side.
3283934	3284154	Okay.
3284867	3286148	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3311748	3312888	Sure, it sounds just fine at 112.
3313368	3314749	You can understand everything perfectly.
3315069	3316909	But at 192, it's like, oh my god.
3316929	3318229	It sounds just like the CD.
3320370	3320630	Anyway.
3323110	3323690	Let's see.
3323810	3325090	What else was I going to bring up here?
3326291	3328111	Big news for Orange Lounge Radio.
3328711	3330071	I don't want to spill too much.
3330771	3338133	However, sometime before the end of the month, we're officially going to be making some big changes to the station.
3338153	3338613	Big changes.
3338673	3339993	Big changes.
3340492	3340812	Radio Kake?
3359420	3363141	I don't want to say too much more, but we're going to freshen up Orange Lounge a little bit.
3363181	3365682	For those of you that said that Orange Lounge is getting too stale.
3365722	3368123	We're going to freshen things up around here a little bit.
3368623	3370004	FDS?
3370084	3373785	We don't have an official... Yeah, we're going to spray some FDS on our station.
3374725	3375706	Because it needs it.
3379407	3382688	But we'll announce an official date soon.
3382908	3385689	So stay tuned to our website, OrangeLoungeRadio.com for more details.
3386349	3388010	We can just go ahead and tell them that we were...
3388683	3389824	with all the original content removed.
3413504	3418948	Yeah, except all of us will have been fired and, like, you know, maybe the FU segment's still intact.
3418968	3420048	That'll be the one thing they keep.
3420128	3420549	That'll be it.
3420569	3424351	And don't talk about Bomani anymore.
3426132	3426392	Yeah.
3427092	3428673	And we won't ever talk about Bomani anymore.
3428733	3429894	We'll only talk about country music.
3430274	3434136	And all of us will be replaced by busty Asian chicks and American Idol rejects.
3434917	3438359	And, uh... That'll be it.
3440040	3440941	Loki needs a spin-off show.
3468260	3473682	You should put an ad in the paper, try to get some bustiation chicks over here once a week, and just talk.
3476263	3477983	So, how are they doing today?
3481024	3482365	Good, good.
3482945	3483905	That's right, bounce a little bit.
3485065	3485546	Yeah.
3487746	3489367	Today we're going to play some DDR.
3489387	3493128	Yeah, it'll be great radio, Loki, it'll be excellent radio.
3495086	3501408	I know the folks at home can't see her naked writhing around on the DDR pad, but I can guarantee that she's doing it.
3502448	3502968	Yeah.
3503448	3504328	Go for that AAA.
3505148	3505468	Oh yeah.
3506329	3506709	Slower.
3507749	3508169	Slower.
3508189	3513150	This is why radio porn never took off.
3513350	3517191	Yet radio on the phone, or radio on the phone, sex on the phone is still, you know.
3517211	3517931	That's interactive.
3518031	3519031	That's bi-directional.
3520812	3522192	We're an interactive program.
3523001	3529686	Yes, Skype sex, Skype phone sex, that would be... Crap, I gotta go patent that now.
3530046	3530927	Alright, moving right along.
3532708	3534989	Let's talk about some stuff going on in the Mimani world.
3537791	3538832	I was gonna point this out.
3539192	3543956	There's an interesting thread going on over on DDR Freak right now, and it has to do with Ultramix 2.
3546397	3549860	And one of the moderators over there, Cutress...
3550948	3551629	DarkSakura, Luke, Carameldansen
3581589	3608985	everything on the site and put in all these different combinations of letters and he noticed that if you put in CRZY underscore TH it actually pulls up a banner and it's not this is on Konami of Hawaii's site it's actually a banner that says Crazy in Love by Beyonce and it's got it's own cute little artsy pattern so what the hell is this song banner doing on Konami of Hawaii's site?
3609085	3609405	don't know
3610546	3614448	Looks like why did Apple have a PowerBook G5 link?
3633482	3637805	Could it be that maybe I just got disconnected from IRC?
3637925	3638245	I don't know.
3638946	3640287	I'll try to get back in there.
3640907	3641687	Are you guys still on IRC?
3641747	3643309	Yeah, there was a big split.
3643909	3646331	Oh, I got kicked from chat completely, so I'll try to get back in.
3646931	3652014	Could it be that they were songs that were supposed to be there, and now they're not there anymore?
3652935	3653235	Don't know.
3653835	3654556	But they're on the site.
3655177	3655657	In My Dreams by Nomi
3678157	3679397	That's a licensed song, you guys.
3679457	3687240	It's not the same In My Dreams that was in Dance Maniacs, but it's actually a commercial song.
3687840	3688720	And aren't you lucky?
3688780	3690240	I have a little clip of it, actually.
3691481	3692201	If I can find it.
3696922	3697642	I'm looking right now.
3697682	3698563	I know I had it somewhere.
3699783	3701423	Here's a little clip of that song.
3701624	3704884	Because some folks even on the thread were asking, what in the hell is that song?
3704904	3705345	This is it.
3705585	3706845	This is In My Dreams by Nomi.
3739269	3750251	So interesting that banners exist, not just for that song, but for the Crazy in Love, Beyonce, yet neither one appears to have any connection to Ultramix 2.
3753292	3755572	How do you think to do something like that?
3755632	3756952	I gotta hand it to Cutress.
3757032	3765634	I mean, sure, I've heard of scanning directories to see if there's files in there that aren't linked or something like that, but to figure out that
3766388	3767509	Gee, there's a pattern.
3767869	3769110	Maybe there's songs missing.
3769130	3773433	I guess maybe what he was doing is he was trying to look for the banners for Song Pack 8, maybe.
3773733	3776555	I'm thinking maybe that was it, and then stumbled across this instead.
3777055	3778776	I don't know, but hats off to him.
3779997	3780518	Crazy.
3782419	3782699	Anyway.
3784881	3786922	So, more to develop on now.
3787002	3788243	I guess we will see what happens.
3788903	3790244	Are they going to end up in a song pack?
3790284	3790625	Who knows?
3793366	3793647	Alright.
3795208	3795608	Moving on.
3797987	3804149	I also want to talk about something that's going on with Beatmania 2DX Night Style Consumer.
3805510	3807031	That's a big thing that's going on right now.
3809572	3819816	This is interesting, is that Night Style is going to be coming out next month, but there's going to be, get this, seven different ways to buy 2DX for Night Style.
3820336	3823597	Seven different packages that Konami Style is putting out.
3825143	3832128	Nightstyle plus a Benefit CD, a Visual Emotions 2 DVD that you can just buy by itself.
3832808	3836991	Nightstyle plus the CD, plus Visual Emotions 2, plus a poster.
3837552	3838552	That's going to run you about $100.
3839413	3842975	Nightstyle plus a Benefit CD, plus V-Rare 10, plus poster.
3843896	3845917	And then just all these combinations.
3845977	3852562	There's Visual Emotions 2, poster, V-Rare 10, and then all these goodies together.
3853371	3855733	My gosh, there's a gazillion different ways you can buy this.
3855793	3857274	It almost sounds like something Nintendo would do.
3857955	3859116	There's the one at the bottom there.
3859196	3866502	Nightstyle, Benefit CD, VRare 10, member of B4U, and a poster.
3866882	3867763	And that's going to run you about $200.
3870005	3876810	Yes, you could actually buy yourself a member of B4U.
3877091	3877611	That's lovely.
3878152	3878692	To torture?
3878992	3882095	It sounds like something that... Yes, there's a keychain.
3887665	3892409	Translation that was posted to the live journal community, BM underscore 2DX.
3892449	3893170	This is very nice.
3893710	3900076	Beatmania 2DX, it seems, in order to put out, it is the portable strap which finishes the whole... Remember, this is English here.
3900376	3905481	With the metal material and the good set which designs the various designs of 2DX as the sticker.
3906181	3909306	The metal portable strap, the mark of 2DX stamped in the metal plate.
3909626	3914393	In addition, the yearning AAA mark of the user is stamped on plate back.
3914794	3918580	So in other words, they're going to have this kind of AAA keychain, it sounds like.
3919187	3922831	Some of the songs that are going to be on Visual Emotions, too.
3922871	3923952	Some of the videos that are going to be on it.
3924093	3928658	Doll, Lucy, Space Fight, Quasar.
3929018	3930280	So a lot of the newer songs.
3930300	3932302	But then it kind of goes back to some of the old ones, too.
3932362	3936527	Summer Vacation, 2DX, the song from, what, Fizz Style?
3937407	3939550	Burn in the Floor, Leading Cyber.
3941311	3946093	Doesn't this sound like something Nintendo would do, repackaging the same thing seven different ways?
3946133	3950594	It's like, you should buy seven Game Boy Advances so you can have them all in different colors.
3950654	3951474	Wouldn't that be fabulous?
3952975	3954055	How many iMac colors are there?
3954175	3954795	Yeah, exactly.
3954875	3955616	It's like an iMac.
3957096	3958997	Jamie, you're going to get Night Style, right?
3959897	3960457	I'm debating.
3960497	3962858	Are you going to go for one of these frilly combinations if you do it?
3963778	3964318	I'm debating.
3964858	3965699	Probably just going to get the game.
3965999	3966599	Maybe it'll be rare.
3966699	3968740	Are you going to do the one where you can buy a member of B4U?
3969200	3969780	No, that's okay.
3971066	3976469	Not unless I get to, you know, abuse and, you know, maybe draw on her with a Sharpie or something.
4000922	4003924	You know, like, I don't really care about the Visual Emotions CD or whatever it is.
4004424	4009327	You know, the Benefits CD might be cool, because it might be, I think it might be the live performance or whatever they did.
4009367	4014570	You know how they do those, you know, invitation-only concerts and crap.
4014830	4016751	I think that's probably what it is, the second one of those.
4016871	4019252	But, yeah, it'd be rare.
4019492	4022074	Just like the audio CDs there, you know, coming with that.
4022114	4026597	And of course, you know, the consumer tracks that will be on 2DX9, so that'll be cool.
4029078	4029198	Hmm.
4031844	4032705	This is interesting.
4034066	4037449	This just in, and it goes back to the topic we were talking about previously.
4037749	4038810	Literally, just in.
4039670	4041031	El Mullet posted this in chat.
4041051	4046636	It says, use the letters S-C-A-N in that whole Konami of Hawaii site thing with the hidden banners.
4046956	4051980	If you use scan, S-C-A-N, as the letters, mystique, scandalous.
4052681	4054382	That's a song I've heard at the club a few times.
4054422	4056043	That's definitely a big licensed song.
4056083	4056784	I know that song.
4056924	4058245	Very interesting.
4058285	4059086	Very interesting.
4060186	4062747	All hidden away on Konami of Hawaii's site for some reason.
4064268	4064748	Who knows?
4065669	4074012	And of course, Jason in our chat room, our resident, one of our many internet geeks we have to listen to this show, is kind of, is talking about what?
4075933	4077854	He found the banner for A. I was just randomly typing in letters.
4077914	4081216	I did A, A, A, A, and I found A. Well, we all know that A's in the game already.
4081236	4082976	I know, but I mean, I was just randomly typing in letters.
4083076	4084237	Yeah, yeah, it works.
4085594	4091116	But he says that if you think about it, every DDR version, you remember the master song list?
4091237	4093138	Loki's talked about this on the show before in the past.
4093158	4095359	If you haven't listened to the show in a while, you probably never heard this.
4095399	4102563	But basically, every DDR song has this four-letter code and some kind of master list of songs that's out there.
4103263	4112608	And is there a connection between that list and the fact that the way these files were named, the songs happen to have a four-letter link to them?
4113280	4117703	So maybe they were kind of, who knows, linking that all together.
4119524	4120525	Very interesting.
4123587	4124768	Very, very, very interesting.
4126449	4127650	Oh my gosh, look at this.
4128010	4128510	What are they doing?
4128931	4130332	Somebody must be running it right now.
4130432	4135996	El Mullet just said, use the letters P-A-R-T and you get this song.
4136336	4138237	Pink, get the party started.
4138998	4141359	You guys know Pink, right?
4141419	4142340	Wasn't that a Pump song?
4143437	4144618	Yeah, there's a bump song.
4146119	4146520	Weird.
4147381	4148061	Weird stuff.
4150883	4151784	You're already here first.
4152685	4158610	For some reason, Pink, Beyonce, Mystique, they're all lurking on Konami of Hawaii's site.
4158910	4161212	Is there a big song pack planned for the future?
4162012	4162473	Who knows?
4162773	4163133	Who knows?
4164755	4165215	Interesting.
4167857	4169238	Let's see, where to go to now?
4170399	4171100	I think we'll take a break.
4171829	4172069	GIGADELIC
4199588	4200129	Gigadelic?
4200509	4201130	Like a gigabyte?
4201170	4201711	Gigadelic.
4201811	4202572	We'll be back after this.
4359344	4360165	Thank you for watching!
4470911	4473212	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4601386	4607668	Orange Lounge Radio we put your thing down flip it and reverse it we are back here on Orange Lounge Radio
4617020	4617880	You should see our chatroom.
4617900	4623062	They're going crazy trying to come up with all these four-letter combinations now to try and figure out what else they can find on the site.
4623542	4629363	Even though, apparently, there's a script that's running, I think it was running for a while and then it stopped.
4629423	4632724	Cutter's made a post about he had to stop it and he's thinking about starting it again.
4633024	4637446	That's not stopping people in our chatroom from going and trying to figure out all the four-letter combinations.
4637806	4641407	Now somebody's trying to dig up a master list so they can go through all the four letters.
4642387	4643387	I wouldn't know anything about that.
4643407	4645768	God damn, you people got time on your hands.
4646149	4646850	It's beautiful.
4648491	4651113	It's crazy how obsessed people are with DDR.
4651233	4656157	Maybe not necessarily obsessed with DDR, but just... Pointing the finger?
4656177	4657459	Yeah, solving the mystery.
4657819	4659660	There's a little bit of a thrill of it, I think.
4659700	4660241	It's kind of neat.
4660641	4660861	Matt?
4661602	4661962	Or Loki?
4663644	4671811	I was going to say that there were a few four-letter codes I think I had posted on our site a long-ass time ago, but if you look in the news archives, you probably can find it.
4673152	4674653	So, anyways.
4677361	4677941	Very interesting.
4679182	4682183	Yeah, I think if you do a news archive search, there is a master list somewhere.
4683803	4684504	They were numeric.
4687505	4688345	Yeah.
4688585	4689125	And they didn't work.
4690466	4692567	The numeric codes don't work.
4693547	4694047	Oh, they don't.
4694948	4695388	Interesting.
4696148	4698109	I tried about six or seven of them.
4698789	4705712	Well, some folks are going crazy and trying to find something out.
4706032	4706632	Good luck, you guys.
4708502	4711785	And if you find out more, tell us so we can spoil the news on air for everybody.
4712766	4714267	What news it is, we don't know.
4714427	4718911	Just, you know, hey, this song banner's sitting here in a directory not being used for anything.
4719592	4723776	Probably don't mean shit, but... Boy, isn't it funny what Konami keeps on their site?
4724116	4726418	I wonder what other kind of goodies Konami has on their site.
4726918	4730442	Maybe they've got, like, top secret documents and stuff all hidden on their website.
4730502	4730782	Who knows?
4732415	4735178	Anyway, we're going to open up the Skype line for those of you guys who want to give us a call.
4735258	4743567	Just go to www.OrangeLoungeRadio.com, click on Interact With Us, and you can read all about how you, yes, you, the listener, can call us.
4744167	4751235	We're ghetto, you see, and we can't afford an 800 number, really, so we have you call us using this fancy little internet program.
4752196	4753017	So, do that.
4753712	4754252	Legend of Zaku
4774965	4775605	Let me see.
4775665	4781328	He's trying to figure out any other banners that I can actually guess.
4781768	4786610	It's just not a Skype line segment if Zaku doesn't hammer the lines and get in first, man.
4786670	4787470	It's crazy.
4787990	4788931	It's just luck, man.
4788971	4790071	I just managed to hit it first.
4790171	4790831	Apparently, yeah.
4790871	4793833	Now there's a bunch of people trying to get in right now, but you got in there first.
4793913	4794313	Lucky you.
4796494	4797674	Why, is my question.
4797754	4802596	Why are you hammering the site trying to find all these different letter combinations?
4803243	4803784	Think about it.
4803904	4807068	I mean, if you find it, then you'll probably be the first one to know.
4807909	4811153	You know, and then you'll be tempted to just, you know, spread the news.
4811673	4817600	And then, you know, if it gets to that point where Konami finds out what we're actually doing, then it might be a problem.
4818001	4818161	But...
4820487	4822409	What exactly are you finding out?
4822529	4823790	That's the problem.
4823830	4825671	We have no idea what we're finding out.
4825691	4827713	No, we're just finding out banners.
4828393	4833697	I mean, possibly we could find out whatever might be on the next songpacks.
4833898	4835619	It could also just be somebody fucking with us.
4835859	4837320	It could be somebody fucking with us.
4837360	4838601	That could be it, completely.
4838681	4839902	Somebody's just fucking with you.
4839922	4840983	That could be true.
4841524	4846147	You know, Cutris is a great guy, but he's a mod on DDR Freak.
4846187	4849350	What a perfect person to be in cahoots with Konami, right?
4849430	4849610	Yes.
4850560	4851161	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
4865618	4866359	It's real simple.
4867259	4877487	We already know that some of the good licenses we managed to figure out and I'm surprised at how far Konami is going and we don't even know to what extent they are going to.
4878849	4879349	Yeah, you're right.
4879389	4879829	We don't know.
4880710	4885354	The access for who's trying to or what files are trying to be loaded and all that stuff?
4885454	4885734	I mean the
4887196	4893921	No, the fact that we managed to uncover certain licenses that we thought Konami would never imagine getting.
4894082	4900867	Well, as far as I know, though, the webmaster of the Konami site there reads the DDR Freak thread.
4901207	4905351	She's going to wake up Monday morning and see this and meow.
4905371	4906271	Rename the files?
4906612	4909174	Well, probably the files are going to be gone at some point tomorrow.
4909474	4914558	The question is, if the files are deleted...
4915268	4917949	Then we know we found something we weren't supposed to find.
4918909	4919569	But what?
4920190	4922550	What cat and what bag was just let out?
4923191	4923651	We don't know.
4924431	4925811	I don't think they have anything on us.
4926292	4927592	I mean, they have nothing on us.
4927652	4929793	We just managed to find it because of dumb luck.
4930313	4930873	Either way.
4931713	4932594	Either way.
4933454	4943057	Even if these songs... Even if this whole thing was just set up to fuck with us and these songs never see the light of day, you bet... It's a Groundhog's Day thing.
4943659	4944279	That's true.
4944339	4944819	I don't know.
4944879	4945279	It depends.
4945319	4948260	I mean, it could go either way.
4948280	4952581	We're just basically taking stabs in the dark right now and we're hitting something.
4970891	4972532	I think that's a nice way to sum it up.
4972592	4981436	I mean, Konami, I can only thank Konami for basically trying at least to get some decent licenses compared to the ones that they did for Europe.
4982517	4987539	Beyonce, Beyonce, that's huge.
4988179	4988940	That is huge.
4989120	4991581	Crazy in Love by Beyonce, that is huge.
4992361	4995263	If that is going to be in one of the downloadable songpacks...
4997142	5001205	If that is going to be in one of the downloadable song packs, that is freaking huge.
5001325	5006528	And the first question people are going to ask probably will be, why the hell wasn't this in the game to start with?
5006708	5008209	But we don't know.
5008530	5009250	We don't know any of this.
5009730	5010911	Will our questions ever be answered?
5010931	5011171	Probably not.
5011191	5012172	That's another good question.
5013601	5016922	But I'll judge that song once I see the steps.
5017022	5018362	Well, yeah, it always comes down to that.
5018382	5027124	If they're like eight, like most of the new songs, like eight to nine, like most of the new songs are, then, you know, then I'll make my decision.
5027544	5027804	All right.
5027824	5029584	Until then, we can only just speculate.
5030064	5030484	Sounds good.
5030524	5031885	Anything else you want to share with us, Zaku?
5031925	5032505	That's about it.
5032665	5032885	All right.
5033305	5035145	I got other people trying to get in, so I'm going to have to let you go.
5036446	5037906	Um, bye.
5039206	5039486	All right.
5039566	5040066	Bye, Zaku.
5040086	5040466	Have a good one.
5041247	5041487	Later.
5043067	5043287	Huh.
5044611	5047812	You know, somebody in the chat room just pointed out something very interesting.
5048072	5049753	The chat room just died.
5050413	5051413	I know what you're doing.
5052654	5054534	You're all trying to hammer that site right now.
5054594	5055235	Okay, maybe not.
5055275	5061197	Maybe some of you guys had to go watch the last part of this stupid bowl and see what the Patriots won.
5061357	5062077	Who are the Patriots?
5062417	5062837	Who are they?
5062857	5064298	New England.
5064338	5064538	What?
5064838	5065298	New England.
5065478	5066018	Oh, New England.
5066098	5066679	Some team.
5066959	5069560	Like the whole part of that nation?
5069920	5070540	New England, all of them?
5073418	5076578	Oh, I'm totally not even paying attention to the Skype line.
5076598	5077559	There's another call coming in.
5077579	5078019	Let's go to it.
5078319	5079439	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
5081880	5083480	Hello, you are on Orange Lounge Radio.
5085701	5087101	You're soon to not be on Orange Lounge Radio.
5087461	5089402	I think we got a problem hearing you, buddy.
5089442	5093563	Make sure that your microphones turn on and all that.
5096264	5097424	Try talking to us one more time.
5099185	5099825	Can't hear you, buddy.
5099845	5100765	Sorry, we're going to have to let you go.
5102372	5102872	That's a bummer.
5103012	5103713	Let's go to here.
5103993	5105514	Oh, I think we got... Did we get it?
5105694	5106595	Hi, you're on Orange Sounds Radio.
5107155	5108396	Yo, Skye, Siggy here.
5108536	5109237	Hi, Siggy.
5110017	5111438	Ah, finally.
5111478	5115201	Real quick, I gotta offer one piece of advice to prospective people calling in.
5115994	5121257	If you're going to call the show, before you call us, add this username to your Skype list.
5121337	5122137	Give them a call.
5122658	5125159	Echo123.
5125259	5126680	It's Echo123.
5127060	5129381	And when you call that, you can hear yourself.
5129762	5131162	It's like literally an echo.
5131503	5133404	So you can tell if your Skype line is working or not.
5133484	5135045	So really good tip for you guys.
5135105	5135985	So give that a try.
5136365	5137426	Anyway, what's on your mind, Siggy?
5138086	5139627	Well, it's about night style.
5140788	5142209	Ah, yes, night style.
5142229	5142949	What's up with night style?
5143766	5146427	Don't get me wrong, great idea, great concept, a lot of people there need help.
5172745	5176128	But, you know, there's other good organizations out there to donate to, too.
5176188	5176828	That's all I want to say.
5177328	5177629	Yeah.
5178169	5182793	So, have you seen the cover art for Night Style?
5182933	5186876	I did see the cover art for Night Style, but I didn't show it to the other people in studio.
5188237	5190178	And now I have no idea where the box art went.
5190478	5191579	That's because Rob's lousy.
5192340	5193320	I know, I'm horrible.
5193661	5195682	I will dig it up, though, the box art.
5195702	5196843	What did you think of the box art?
5197355	5199978	Well, it's really fine to me, actually.
5200038	5202421	Everybody at the Monty Stall has been complaining about it.
5202822	5203182	You know what?
5203242	5205405	And when I looked at it, it looked fine to me, too.
5205545	5207207	I don't know what the people are bitching about, really.
5207307	5210170	It's better than some of the other ones, I think.
5211654	5217336	They're actually buying what's in the game, not what's on the cover, right?
5217476	5218016	Very good point.
5218237	5220157	Here it is, for those of you in the studio.
5220437	5224199	Actually, I can post this as well, ha ha ha, in our chat room.
5224519	5227220	Here is a picture of the 9th style cover.
5227920	5228680	What do you guys think of that?
5231181	5232562	It looks a lot like Loki's head.
5234202	5234703	It looks cool.
5235343	5237084	That's kind of rad.
5238044	5238264	Yeah.
5239403	5240324	I don't see the problem with it.
5240484	5245431	I mean, they've got your mandatory DJ girl on it, so... Yeah, Iroha and Eri.
5246272	5246572	Uh-huh.
5248755	5250597	Are those the two new characters in 9th Style?
5251278	5255002	Yeah, they're the 2DX DJs representing 9th Style.
5255022	5255743	That's what I thought.
5256204	5257025	Iroha and Eri.
5257813	5259995	That's what I thought, and it looks fine to me.
5260715	5262857	Look at that, it looks like she just got a manicure today.
5264498	5272984	You know, those people who have been complaining, they were thinking of the actual poster as the cover art for Night Style.
5274945	5277167	Oh, because that was the poster as well?
5277607	5278828	It's supposed to be the poster.
5279148	5281069	So Konami got a little lazy, who cares?
5281830	5282030	Yeah.
5284114	5288335	I'm happy as hell that we're getting Night Style in the first place.
5289115	5293276	If they're going to get a little sloppy and make the poster the same thing as the cover art, I don't care.
5293976	5294876	It's a fine picture.
5295797	5300718	I would be more much happy if they put a reincarnation back on Night Style.
5300738	5303858	Aren't they supposed to be bringing a bunch of songs back?
5305199	5311180	Actually, I already mentioned to you last time that there would be three songs that would mostly come back.
5312486	5316728	Right, well, because aren't there songs that have new anothers that need to be accounted for?
5316888	5318089	Yeah.
5318109	5320490	Jam, Screams, Minimalian, and Checking You Out.
5320550	5321671	Right, right, okay, that's right.
5322811	5325273	Hmm.
5325313	5327093	Well, it sounds like it's going to be a good mix either way.
5327113	5328194	I can't wait to hear more details.
5328274	5329795	I can't wait to see that full song list.
5330375	5339740	And what I really want to see, I want to see if we get any more preview tracks from 10th and 11th, and I want to see, and I know it's red, but I'm calling it 11th, I want to see if there are good preview songs.
5340465	5342166	I want Kachak!
5342686	5343447	I want Kachak!
5343467	5343727	AGEHA!
5343747	5343927	AGEHA!
5343967	5344127	AGEHA!
5363450	5365451	All right, well, you've been listening to the show long enough.
5365491	5367632	You know I'm really white when it comes to my pronunciation.
5367992	5370653	Yeah, but I'm always here to help you out.
5370853	5371953	Well, I appreciate it.
5372213	5373614	It's the beauty of the Skype line.
5373654	5375595	I can be corrected almost in person.
5375675	5376095	It's great.
5376415	5377996	You can be corrected in person.
5378036	5380757	Yeah, when Jamie isn't here to correct me in person, you are.
5380877	5381917	It's beautiful.
5381937	5382097	Shut up.
5384522	5384762	Yeah.
5385062	5387163	And there's another one that you mispronounced it a lot.
5387583	5390603	You know, the artist, the cheer train, it was actually Fujita Blender.
5390803	5391404	Fujita.
5391784	5392024	Yeah.
5392324	5396065	I like Fusita.
5396485	5396945	All right.
5397305	5401586	We're going to let you go because we're getting other calls and I want to let you get back to that AOL conversation you're having in the background.
5401686	5401946	All right?
5402446	5402686	All right.
5402946	5403406	Have a good one.
5403906	5404146	Later.
5404327	5404587	Bye.
5406047	5406887	We got another call.
5406907	5409008	We'll take one more call and maybe we'll go to Cage Match after this.
5409648	5409928	I don't know.
5410068	5410348	Please.
5410368	5410768	All right.
5411677	5413578	What, you don't like talking to people on the Skype line?
5413598	5415038	I like talking to people, but I'm ready for the cage match.
5415639	5416659	Oh, you want to bring it on.
5417439	5419020	Well, I just don't really care.
5419040	5420840	Alright, let me get to this person here.
5420860	5421821	It's already been brought in.
5422441	5426542	Let me get to this poor person who's sitting here on the Skype line waiting for us to acknowledge their presence.
5426963	5428283	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
5428903	5430584	Hey, Sky, it's El Mullet again.
5430664	5432044	Hello, El Mullet.
5432544	5433525	What is going on?
5433585	5436506	You guys are just digging through Konami's site right now.
5436566	5438727	You're posting all these crazy banners.
5438807	5439467	What's going on?
5440100	5443263	Well, all these crazy banners equal two that I found.
5444063	5446205	Hey, that's more than I found.
5447606	5451629	I just put in two random words and I pulled out two things.
5452350	5453210	I have no idea.
5453671	5457094	So you're trying to think of like four letter words that might come up with something.
5457774	5458815	Yeah, something like that.
5460476	5461297	Wow, and you found two.
5461557	5462638	What do you think this all is?
5462658	5463819	What do you think this all adds up to?
5465089	5467110	I wouldn't read too much into it personally.
5467430	5473594	I mean, I'm sure that there's some sort of explanation why we've managed to pull up five licensed songs.
5474675	5479118	I'm thinking maybe, you know, they were there, but now they're not there, you know.
5479418	5480218	Five songs?
5480839	5482400	Five songs in a song pack?
5482500	5485281	Loki, Loki's tapping my leg for some reason.
5485381	5489484	It might be noticed, or I might mention that not only...
5490091	5518885	by putting into those directories are you pulling up stuff from Ultramix 2 but Ultramix 1 so I could theorize it could be also Ultramix 3 now that's a good thought there maybe these are possible Ultramix 3 songs or Ultramix 7 by doing the same thing so that's Ultramix 1 interesting because we all know Ultramix 3 has to happen at this point it has to has to happen and if it doesn't happen there will be burnination going on
5520513	5522775	I'm going to mount all this banner finding.
5522815	5530240	Remember when a picture was leaked that had the Take It to the Morning Light banner from DDR Max and it had an SP4 icon on it?
5530360	5531400	I remember that.
5531500	5532041	I remember that.
5532101	5532921	And it didn't mean shit.
5532941	5534722	Yeah, it didn't mean shit.
5534943	5538845	What we could be pulling up right now could very well not be meaning shit at all.
5539506	5541367	But then again... They're pretty banners.
5541427	5543028	That Crazy in Love banner is kind of cute.
5544257	5544997	I need that song.
5545017	5546238	I need to play it Tuesday.
5546258	5546698	I have plenty of...
5569522	5572104	Yeah, maybe we'll grab a little clip of it off the iTunes store.
5572124	5574205	How could anybody have not heard Crazy in Love, though?
5574285	5574625	Seriously.
5574965	5577807	Our listeners, you've got to be living in a cave if you've never heard Crazy in Love.
5577867	5581829	It's just my spin teacher plays that in spin class, and it's fun.
5582710	5582970	Hold on.
5583010	5586032	I'm sorry, Elmola, but now Jamie's got me on a different subject here.
5586072	5587413	We've got to play a little clip here.
5587833	5588193	Here it is.
5588253	5588533	Here it is.
5597819	5598139	Come on.
5598159	5599120	Don't you want to shake your booty?
5611637	5612458	This is the part I like.
5613298	5613919	Oh, I'm sorry.
5614079	5615160	I totally cut it off right there.
5619823	5621164	Those could be cool little gallops.
5621625	5622085	Come on.
5622826	5624107	That would have been a great DDR song.
5625188	5626789	I hope the Ultramix 3 thing is the case.
5626949	5628290	Or a song pack, but we'll see.
5629551	5632033	I have a feeling that we're being fucked with, and it doesn't mean shit.
5633461	5640282	Not only were we pulling licensed banners, we also pulled two Konami original banners.
5641183	5644123	Cutris pulled off GMD and Hold On Me.
5644183	5644703	That's right.
5645383	5647824	So who knows where that's going.
5648124	5651625	So that's seven songs, so it's not a true song pack.
5653145	5653525	That's true.
5653565	5654625	So there's more than five.
5654765	5657166	So who knows what's going on.
5659298	5662180	I'm sure an explanation will be offered, you know, eventually.
5662500	5665582	Like how Song Pack 8 is going to be released eventually.
5689845	5696590	You know that if trying to find something secret that you're not supposed to see on some website is involved, Loki's in on it.
5697931	5699352	Anything else you want to share with us, Amolet?
5700313	5701233	That's pretty much it.
5701273	5703935	This is the big topic of conversation right now, after all.
5704055	5704696	You know what?
5706017	5719006	Unfortunately, the way things work in the Mamani scene is it seems like now we're getting in this rhythm of getting all our games at the end of the year in the Christmas season, which makes everything post-Christmas to E3 a real dead period.
5720802	5723043	But that's why we talk about other stuff, too.
5723103	5723644	What can we say?
5724444	5724864	Exactly.
5725044	5725385	All right.
5725605	5726545	Hey, plug your site.
5727646	5728967	InsidePulse.com.
5730227	5730768	Visit it.
5731668	5732509	Love us, damn it.
5732809	5733269	Love us.
5734009	5734670	But not too much.
5735590	5736171	Not too much.
5736291	5739332	I mean, love us to the extent of you're not being creepy about it.
5739452	5739733	All right.
5739933	5740413	Sounds good.
5740713	5743495	So visit Inside Pulse and read the Elmullet column.
5744876	5746637	Actually, it's not called the Elmullet column, though.
5748277	5748838	But look for it.
5748878	5749218	It's great.
5751089	5752050	Alright, thanks for the call.
5752890	5753071	Bye.
5753251	5753711	Have a good one.
5779722	5780482	I can't explain it.
5780522	5780983	It's crazy.
5783084	5783524	All right.
5784704	5790827	As a reminder, you guys, to participate in this next segment, you're going to want to be in our chat room, www.orangeloungeradio.com.
5791207	5792368	Click on chat.
5792468	5794989	It is time for the Orange Lounge Radio Cage Match.
5797290	5807274	Last week in the Orange Lounge Radio Cage Match, it kind of surprised us because Echo Image was given the boot from the Cage Match, and it was replaced by...
5808106	5816077	Dream, that's right, J-pop artist Dream, with their rendition of Night of Fire, the song you might recognize from 2DX, Parapara.
5816497	5820563	It was Jamie's pick, so that's going to be the first song you guys hear tonight.
5820703	5824088	As a reminder, the way the cage match works, you hear three songs.
5824808	5826429	One of them you hear a clip of.
5826489	5827950	It's the song that won last week.
5828251	5831052	Two songs you hear brand new in their entirety.
5831653	5839598	And you're going to pick your favorite and the winning song goes into rotation all week long on Orange Lounge Radio's Bomani Music and More program.
5839678	5840419	You get the vote.
5841059	5841660	So here it is.
5841780	5843561	Song number one you get to pick from tonight.
5844221	5846563	Last week's winner, Dream, Night of Fire.
5852660	5853781	Thank you for watching!
5883288	5889090	More deeply, I want to know the truth of you Don't say sweet, kind words Because it will stain my heart and make me feel like crying
5925337	5928199	Night of Fire, I'm so happy to be with you.
5928219	5930761	Night of Fire, I want to feel fate with you.
5930781	5935044	Night of Fire, I can't say it, but there are days when I want you to hug me.
5935064	5936825	Night of Fire, I'm attracted to you.
5936845	5938906	Night of Fire, I don't know what to do.
5962370	5963570	Thanks for watching!
5987430	5993131	Alright, song number one in tonight's cage match, last week's winner, Dream, Night of Fire.
5993311	5994191	Will it win again?
5994672	5995192	We'll see.
5995252	5997192	We've got to bring in two challengers, though, first.
5997872	6000173	First up, my pick, yay, me.
6001373	6004814	I'm going to pick a band that has won the cage match a couple times.
6005214	6010395	It's a real popular band amongst, I think, the folks that play DDR, although it's not a DDR band.
6011550	6011930	Yeah.
6012391	6013952	Yay, Freeze Pop.
6013972	6014172	Enjoy.
6041364	6044286	I know you work across the street in the indie record store.
6044306	6046107	I'm thinking someday that we'll meet.
6046167	6047608	I'm thinking we'll do something more.
6047668	6048629	I hide behind my magazine.
6048649	6049709	Then I see you walk on by.
6049769	6050690	I'm not ready to be seen.
6050870	6051310	I'll just
6107552	6110880	I'm on a stakeout I'm on a stakeout I'm on a stakeout
6129714	6130816	Thank you for watching!
6159291	6168420	The feeling is elating, biding my time Yeah, I know that you'll soon be mine Soon to mine Can't let you see me Can't let you see me Can't let you see me
6225183	6227905	All right, first challenger tonight, song number two, Freeze Pop, Stake Out.
6227925	6230907	Did that song stick out in your mind, or would you like to take it out to the trash?
6230927	6231107	Jamie.
6231127	6231287	Jamie.
6251914	6254355	I like Freeze Pop, but that song just didn't do it for me.
6255236	6257657	Still, it was a good song, so they get a 7.
6258678	6259958	Alright, 7 from Jamie.
6260499	6260819	Bugs!
6264160	6268002	Can't hear you, you gotta practically give head to that mic, you gotta get that close.
6268263	6270804	There you go, now talk.
6271744	6272985	I like Freeze Pop, I give it a 9.
6273125	6273525	Perfect.
6274006	6274426	Okay, good.
6274446	6274566	Angel!
6274626	6274826	Angel!
6276038	6279080	I don't give a shit, you know what?
6279140	6280281	I hate that fucking song.
6280301	6280922	It's awful.
6281422	6282122	It gets a 1.
6282163	6282383	AWFUL!
6305120	6308003	I'm sorry, talking over synthesizers is not fucking music.
6308283	6308403	Awful.
6308423	6309924	At least it's not a negative number.
6311926	6313247	Don't give my BS.
6313387	6321114	Yes, whereas a song that is over synth to all hell, so it's GROSS, GROSS, GROSS, is music.
6322756	6326019	Did I never... I never said it was good when I put it in, okay?
6326039	6326139	Yeah.
6327975	6334084	Last time I checked, you're supposed to like the songs, at least somewhat, that you are going to put in the cagement.
6334344	6335306	Call me crazy.
6335386	6336447	Maybe you missed that memo.
6336467	6336908	Crazy.
6337289	6337589	All right.
6337629	6337990	Anyway.
6338531	6338951	Anyway.
6340574	6342016	My thoughts on Freeze Pop.
6342842	6345184	I feel completely opposite from Loki.
6345304	6350247	I think the minimalist synth sound that they have, I think that is what makes them so cool.
6350687	6356710	And I love her voice, because she has this very, I don't care what you all think type thing in your voice.
6356770	6357811	I love her voice.
6358472	6362194	And the pop culture references are awesome, but they're not cheesy.
6362254	6364515	Like, I've heard bands with cheesy pop culture references.
6364635	6365156	It's bad.
6365776	6366256	They're good.
6367237	6367457	Yeah.
6367890	6375635	Yeah, so I would give them like, I would give it like seriously like an 8.5, maybe a 9, 8.75, let's give it an 8.75, I like it a lot.
6376536	6380018	Alright, let's get to song number 3, which is Loki's pick, what did he pick?
6381660	6382920	Doesn't matter, it sucks.
6384301	6386203	Thank you, thank you.
6387904	6393788	No, what I picked was, it was actually a song I had heard a while ago and I had downloaded just recently.
6394511	6396393	for the hell of it, because I like the song.
6396753	6398154	It's another freeze-pop song, isn't it?
6398995	6401117	No, it's not a freeze-pop song, thank God.
6402037	6403058	Thank God for that.
6403839	6404239	Shit.
6404780	6406902	No, this is The Killers with Somebody Told Me.
6408083	6410004	And it would be perfect for Guitar Freaks.
6411706	6415229	Alright, Loki says this is his Guitar Freaks song that he would like to see.
6415269	6417551	The Killers, Somebody Told Me, song number three.
6417671	6417811	Enjoy.
6417831	6417931	Enjoy.
6422677	6429641	I'm breaking my back just to know your name Seventeen tracks and I'm hiding with this game
6455951	6457033	Thank you for watching!
6487668	6491089	DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft
6524457	6541349	Just have it ain't close in a place like this I said I have it ain't close in a place like this Bring it back down, bring it back down tonight Never thought I'd better leave my room in my blue night Somebody told me you had a boyfriend Who looked like his girlfriend
6555960	6560783	I said baby, baby, please But I just don't know now We all want to see you cry
6589648	6590568	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
6637324	6641625	Alright, that was song number three, The Killers, Somebody Told Me.
6642406	6644986	Will we tell you to vote for that one or not?
6645046	6646707	Even though it's not our decision, it's yours.
6646787	6648368	But we'll tell you our opinion anyway.
6648428	6648728	Jamie?
6649168	6649808	I like that song.
6649868	6650408	It gets a nine.
6651889	6658971	I thought I've heard another version of it before, but since I don't listen to the radio, this is pretty new to me, so I like it a lot.
6659351	6659691	Alright.
6660251	6660511	Bug?
6662792	6663732	I can't hear you, buddy.
6664113	6664613	Yeah, I know.
6666417	6666717	Negative 7.
6666757	6669178	I've been hearing it all week.
6669278	6669518	Angel.
6671119	6671639	It's pretty good.
6671659	6672239	What are you rocking?
6672379	6675400	Eight and a half.
6677921	6680122	This, boys and girls, let this be a lesson to you.
6680182	6685063	If you're thinking right now that this song is overplayed, it's time for you to turn off the radio.
6685203	6685704	Seriously.
6686124	6690005	And start listening to internet radio and other forms of entertainment that's out there.
6690592	6690672	LOKI
6720620	6723841	Night of Fire Night of Fire More deeply Your...
6749051	6751792	And song number two, Freeze Pop, Stakeout.
6752652	6756153	And song number three that you can vote for tonight, The Killers, Somebody Told Me.
6756173	6758294	Somebody told me that I'm living without you.
6758334	6759915	I'm ready, let's roll on to something new.
6777573	6780894	Alright, place vote now.
6781054	6788816	Send a private message to Sky in the chat room with your vote and we'll add it all up and let you guys know who the winner is.
6788936	6791516	Song number one, song number two, or song number three.
6792496	6798838	Meanwhile, Orange Lounge Radio moves right along and I gotta ask Loki a question I ask Loki every week.
6800202	6801923	What the hell's going on in the sim scene now?
6802444	6802824	Anything?
6805667	6806808	I don't think so, really.
6807728	6815215	Other than just people, you know, being afraid about, you know, DRA coming after them for downloading sim files and that type of thing.
6817216	6818577	Still, the websites are down.
6818698	6821380	DDR Mania X and DDR UK.
6821400	6821780	One of the
6823448	6826574	2 of the big 3 that are out there are down.
6826735	6834049	And last week I mentioned there was a bunch of different sort of food mix type packs you can download or
6834659	6840361	Check out, and once again, those are on the forums for Bill Monty's style.
6840381	6841261	You can find those.
6841721	6843962	Really, nothing's been going on.
6844142	6847643	I think everyone's been just gearing up for Super Bowl or something like that.
6848423	6850144	Because, really, there's nothing out there.
6850364	6852665	I'm sure you'll see some more coming out, though, for the 2DX...
6854366	6878117	Red stuff that's come out because obviously now that the OST rips aren't out there you can you know bet that there's going to be some of those sim files coming out but besides that really nothing else going on it's been just quiet and dead like all the websites so that's up that's everything kinda sucks
6880788	6887770	You know, is it just that the sim file authors are using the Super Bowl as an excuse to have more time to look at Asian porn on the internet?
6890391	6896892	I don't know why you'd want to look at Asian porn since Asian porn is censored, but sure, I guess.
6897473	6898913	We can't see Loki's screen for a minute.
6898933	6899673	Let me rephrase.
6899773	6901694	Porn with big-tittied Asian girls.
6903454	6905075	Okay, that's completely acceptable then.
6905835	6906055	Can't.
6906522	6907983	What was the one that I got from DarkSound?
6926227	6932570	FinalFuckX was actually the first Asian full-on porn from Asia I'd actually seen.
6932870	6935371	It was cosplay porn.
6935551	6939494	Yes, it was cosplay porn with characters from Final Fantasy.
6939834	6941535	Didn't we actually do this on the show?
6941935	6944736	I want to say we actually played this on the show on an earlier episode.
6944756	6945076	We didn't?
6945417	6946737	No, maybe way back in the day.
6946757	6948118	We did it as part of an afterbirth.
6948318	6949959	We did the Dance Dance part.
6950379	6950959	Porn, though.
6950999	6955301	I remember Loki gave his review of the Dance Dance Porn, or what was it called?
6955321	6956822	You remember Dance Dance Fuck or something?
6957683	6958403	Something like that.
6958623	6961725	I have it buried under here on my desk somewhere.
6962045	6969308	Because I remember after I bought it or whatever, I watched it once and I go, okay, this is interesting, and then just kind of tossed it.
6969688	6973430	And, you know, it became part of the mass collection of stuff on my desk.
6974851	6974871	I...
6975820	6977722	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
6996670	7005636	For those that are unfamiliar out there, and I will show, this is more for the in-studio folks, there is DDR porn out there.
7006397	7009779	Sadly enough, there is porn that exists.
7010240	7011581	No, there's porn that's out there.
7012241	7024650	And if you go here to the, but myself, image porns, and we go to the not work safe category here, we can see that there are some actual, you know...
7027515	7028255	Oh my god!
7028536	7029356	Get a life!
7029936	7030597	All of you!
7031237	7032017	Get a life!
7033798	7037540	Those of you people posting on this board, what the hell is wrong with you?
7038601	7042943	You're drawing pornography to... Ugh!
7044964	7046364	It's just 4chan, get over it.
7052908	7053348	Head hurts.
7053368	7053648	Head hurts.
7056502	7058366	Jamie, surely you have something to add on this.
7058807	7059268	It's just 4chan.
7059308	7064319	It's all things hentai.
7068629	7070971	But it's DDR-ish characters.
7071651	7073533	It looks like somebody drew that one.
7073593	7075034	It looks like somebody painted that one.
7075074	7076115	It said Max... Look!
7076495	7077015	Colors!
7077476	7080438	Beatmania 2DX characters book for adults only.
7080798	7086122	Like, the song Colors, and you've got all these girls with big titties standing in front of Colors.
7086142	7090405	There goes the cover.
7092487	7093067	Oh, hooray.
7093147	7093568	Yowie.
7093828	7094929	Hooray, because that's any better.
7094949	7096430	Sigh.
7098797	7104178	Anyway, so the Dance Dance Porn or whatever it was, was... Huh?
7109059	7109379	Great.
7110320	7114661	What is that picture of Tran sitting there where you can totally see her clam?
7114761	7115421	What is that?
7116581	7117501	Her clam?
7119222	7120822	Wow, way to go there, Rob.
7122102	7122862	Welcome to the 90s.
7124943	7125343	I don't care.
7131723	7134125	Now they're all posting about it in the chatroom.
7134445	7137668	At least you got them to stop typing in random four-letter words.
7137888	7139289	Now this is going to get more ideas.
7139309	7140650	They're going to try, like, 4chan.
7142432	7145194	Is that the Orange Lounge characters naked?
7147095	7148016	What is wrong?
7148516	7149297	Seriously!
7150598	7151859	Post that link in the chatroom.
7151879	7153020	Can you post that link in the chatroom?
7153040	7153981	Yeah.
7156798	7163601	Somebody found a picture on these Bomani-style porn boards of the Orange Lounge characters from Mobomoga just naked.
7164841	7168022	Seriously, people, get out of the house.
7168462	7172284	If this is you posting this, this is your homework assignment.
7172664	7176465	You are to go outdoors and get at least three hours of fresh air this week.
7178866	7181287	And I want you to touch a real girl.
7182702	7185464	Make sure you have her permission first, and your mom doesn't count, okay?
7185824	7188947	I want you to actually go out and touch a real girl.
7188987	7191449	What is... Jamie, look at this one!
7194151	7195692	It's the chick from Poppin' Music!
7195712	7197634	Oh my god, I want to make an icon out of that!
7200396	7201196	I want a link to that.
7206521	7208302	I just need some heavy breathing to go along with all this.
7208905	7214448	Claire O'Neil says that the naked picture of tart and toffee should be our new banner for Orange Lounge.
7214588	7215488	We could do that.
7215508	7216909	We do have a site remodeling coming up.
7217109	7217789	Hey, how about that?
7217809	7218930	We'll just have that in our banner.
7221611	7222632	I've seen that picture before.
7222792	7223572	Forget it, forget it.
7225173	7225553	I'm done.
7225773	7228114	I'm not going to talk about pornography anymore on the radio.
7228154	7229255	This is pointless, people.
7230756	7232076	For the next five minutes.
7232356	7234617	Just look at what you missed out on, though, if you're not in the chat room.
7234637	7236638	Alright, you guys want to know who won the cage match?
7237439	7237659	No.
7237679	7237719	No.
7238746	7239026	No?
7240107	7240488	Yeah?
7241108	7242549	Alright, let's hear who won tonight's cage match.
7243190	7252578	The winner of tonight's cage match is... Freeze Pop!
7252658	7255641	Yay, we get to kill Loki!
7257322	7258923	Freeze Pop wins tonight.
7262186	7263027	And Loki's mad at me.
7263047	7265329	Alright.
7265349	7265529	Alright.
7266417	7268279	Let's go to a break, shall we, boys and girls?
7268299	7272945	We're going to go to a break, and in this break we've got to get ourselves some more 2DX music.
7274324	7283188	from 2DX Red, because the soundtrack, if you didn't hear, we've been talking about this all night, the soundtrack to 2DX Red came out this week, aka 2DX 11th Style, that's what I've been calling it.
7283488	7286870	I know that's not the real name, and I also don't care, by the way.
7288310	7291532	So we've been playing some songs from that all night long, so we're going to keep that up.
7292392	7295534	I think what we will play in this break, what are we going to do?
7296034	7296134	Um...
7298803	7303585	I want to play, actually, there's a really good song by Soda Fujimori that I want to play.
7303845	7305746	I like that song, so we're going to start it off with that.
7306086	7308627	It's called The Hope of Tomorrow, so we're going to start it off with that.
7309047	7311368	Maybe we'll do some DJ Simon in this break as well.
7312108	7315930	Did we do Don't Be Afraid Myself yet?
7317790	7320572	I don't think we did, so we have to do Don't Be Afraid Myself because I like that song.
7320952	7321872	More Freeze Pop.
7322452	7323833	No, no more Freeze Pop tonight.
7324293	7326834	And I guess, should we do the Politary one?
7328652	7329874	Why not?
7330254	7331496	I'm feeling risky tonight.
7331516	7332898	We're going to do... It's not Naoki.
7333218	7335441	It's June featuring Paula Terry.
7335461	7336662	So have a little hope.
7337123	7337964	We're going to see how that is.
7338024	7338565	Raspberry Heart.
7338585	7341449	Alright, we're going to play all those songs and we'll be back after this.
7417397	7418021	Thanks for watching!
7661024	7663052	Thank you for watching!
7696013	7696736	Thanks for watching!
7742250	7742590	Yeah!
7742690	7743891	C'mon, let's go!
7743971	7748734	You say you're a gift from my heart, but I may be too short and I've got to begin.
7748774	7751415	Sometimes it's tough, a little bit lonely or lonely.
7751515	7753316	I'm not a game of chess, but you're my heart.
7753336	7756478	You're only what you give, and that's what I should learn.
7756538	7758960	You know what to do for you, my mystery heart.
7777173	7782300	I wanted to be the one to keep up with you Why I can't stop with being left behind
7809333	7811175	Gaming Radio, so uncensored.
7835792	7840300	and even Tom Brokaw could get a job with us.
7840480	7841762	Orange Lounge Radio.
7847574	7848014	We're back.
7848395	7848875	Sorry about that.
7848895	7850636	That last song got cut off a little bit.
7850716	7853178	I'm sure none of you guys minded that much because it was Politary.
7853858	7854259	I'm kidding.
7854439	7864365	But apparently one of my macros in IRC happens to control my Winamp, and that is why I'm not going to install more of these crappy scripts into my MRC anymore.
7864446	7866307	So apologies for that.
7867748	7869989	But at least you got a little taste there of Politary.
7871050	7873252	June featuring Politary with Raspberry Heart.
7873712	7875613	And I so wasn't ready to come back from break.
7875693	7876013	Damn it.
7876154	7876754	Oh, well, that's all right.
7878640	7882382	What we're going to do now is... Do we have the TV thingy hooked up?
7882682	7883662	Do you need some time to get that done?
7883942	7884663	Or is it already hooked up?
7885283	7886263	For what she's got?
7889265	7890846	Well, I just don't know how to set it up.
7891686	7892486	That's good, we're good to go.
7893667	7898870	Alright, Jamie wants to share with us another follow-up to something from last week.
7900130	7902511	This has been a running thing for like two weeks now.
7903232	7905113	Well, Jamie, I'll let you set this up for the listeners.
7905153	7905793	What's going on here?
7907600	7915272	I brought the Japanese version of Dracula X to Nocturne in the Moonlight that came out over here as Castlevania Symphony of the Night.
7916033	7916955	I brought the Precursor.
7917556	7920761	I brought with me Dracula X for the PC Engine Duo.
7921437	7930204	So this is kind of neat, because she actually had to bring her whole little system here, a Turbo Duo, which is ages old for a game system.
7930304	7931845	It's like one of the first CD systems.
7932025	7934767	It's like we're having a classic gaming expo in my house right now.
7934947	7935388	It's awesome.
7935408	7937209	This game goes for eBay from anywhere between $150 to $350.
7940352	7941833	We actually didn't pay for ours.
7941913	7943434	It was used to pay us back when someone owed us $100.
7943514	7944014	Yikes!
7944774	7950799	She picked it up for us in Japan for about $100.
7951059	7952400	Okay.
7953560	7953881	Wow.
7953981	7954641	I'm turning it on now.
7954701	7955882	And be watching the webcam.
7956642	7961145	Okay, so if you want to check out the webcam, go to www.orangelandrita.com.
7961165	7961866	The webcam's right there.
7962326	7963447	So look at it, people.
7964358	7967879	View the old schoolness of the Super CD-ROM 2 system.
7967899	7981422	Of course, if you're listening to us on like a rebroadcast or something, such as the one that happens on DDR Freak Radio every Friday night, you don't get to participate along with the webcam because it's not going on right now, but at least you get to hear us kind of talk about it.
7981742	7986023	So now I noticed the boot up screen here for this system you've got.
7986123	7991164	It says Super CD-ROM 2 system, but it says CD-ROM squared.
7991184	7992404	What the hell's the 2?
7995889	7999652	I think it's because it's a dual speed CD.
8000593	8002834	Oh my gosh, it's lightning fast then.
8003154	8004395	It's a dual speed CD.
8004475	8005276	It's a Saturn.
8006697	8008518	Amazing, it's blazing fast.
8009039	8013722	Anyway, I'm going to go ahead and let the whole intro play through because it's in German.
8016144	8019406	And our listeners want nothing more than to hear German right now, I'm sure.
8020026	8023569	I might skip through some of it, but I can't hear it.
8025530	8027131	Remember the old Konami sound?
8027331	8028552	Up, up, down, down, left, right, left, right.
8028592	8031434	So what is this part all about here, DarkSakura?
8051906	8054227	They're sacrificing virgins to bring back Dracula.
8054648	8055088	Awesome.
8055148	8057049	There's the virgin.
8057129	8063053	This is awesome because it's German with Japanese subtitles.
8063073	8067016	And I hope people are saving these for me, please.
8080649	8081950	We want you to rule the world.
8081970	8084331	We are waiting for you, smiling, to overcome the decline.
8084351	8085852	After 100 years, the evil has risen again.
8106414	8109257	Uh, clarify something in the chat room because we don't have motion going on right now.
8109577	8111299	Is there a full motion video on this game?
8111539	8112841	It's fake motion.
8113321	8116044	You know, like... Like Ninja Gaiden cinematics.
8116064	8116685	Yeah.
8117486	8119848	It has some animation.
8119948	8120889	It's spread over stills.
8120929	8121590	Dracula!
8129204	8131346	Why do you feel the need to share this with our listeners?
8131426	8133527	Is this some kind of culture?
8133547	8134348	Because they need to be...
8158149	8168295	Educated in the ways of the old school.
8168535	8172637	What I love about this game is it has a lot of updated Castlevania themes in it.
8172818	8173338	Oh my god.
8173798	8175239	Well, updated for that time.
8175299	8179381	And I'll tell you what, for our chat room, I am willing to mp3 the whole CD for you.
8181202	8182683	This music really speaks to me.
8182783	8187306	It sends the message to me that Freepop is an actual music and it sucks!
8188052	8189113	That's what it says to me.
8195395	8198557	The way it looks on the webcam, it almost looks like the skeletons are dancing.
8198597	8200798	Yeah, thriller all of a sudden.
8200858	8201658	Shaun of the Dead.
8216684	8219565	Okay, so I'll play a little bit of it.
8219845	8222065	But you have to hear, though, Maria.
8222085	8224305	Because Maria is a playable character in this.
8224985	8227506	And she's a cheesy little girl in a pink dress.
8228666	8229406	That throws birds.
8229606	8230766	Yeah, what the hell is that?
8231066	8235887	That's, you know, maybe I'm just out of touch with the whole Castlevania slash Dracula series.
8236227	8238588	But what the hell is up with the throwing birds?
8239648	8242288	All the characters always had a whip or like a knife or something.
8242308	8246069	Richter gets the whole manly ending where he's marching out of the castle triumphant.
8246539	8251802	and Maria has one where she's being followed by her little animal friends skipping while there's happy music playing.
8251882	8253003	Jamie, stop making the grudge noise.
8254444	8256465	And also, this should sound familiar, though.
8257506	8261048	I always love that satanic church music that Castlevania games have.
8261368	8270714	See, for anyone who's ever played this on the Super Nintendo, it gives you a hint, but this is... You can tell that Symphony of the Night is definitely a sequel to this game.
8270734	8275477	You know, this would be good music to play, like, say, I don't know, before a certain wedding.
8276861	8277542	in a church.
8277562	8278543	Dude, that would be great.
8278643	8280064	I should play that before my wedding.
8281745	8283367	So let's see, do we want Maria?
8283387	8285489	Yes, sir!
8286049	8286770	Or do we want Richter?
8286890	8289232	That's good for Richter.
8289252	8290793	Maria sounded like Chun-Li there.
8291253	8292114	Yes, sir!
8292174	8293555	Well, she did go, yes, sir.
8293696	8294756	Alright.
8297219	8299280	I'll go ahead and start with whatever the hell this difficult level is.
8300581	8302143	I know, I should start with the very beginning.
8302163	8302363	Okay.
8310656	8312177	I'm being soothed by the music.
8312418	8312978	Hey, run away.
8314399	8315240	I'm not soothed.
8316261	8316781	Soothe me.
8319203	8319443	Okay.
8320664	8321705	Jamie's playing for a little bit here.
8326709	8328010	And then they ate the minstrels.
8328030	8329131	I get to fight death now.
8332153	8333574	Truckwagon!
8336356	8341400	So, in the game right now, Jamie is riding on a horseback and carriage or something.
8341961	8346545	The graphic, by the way, should look familiar at the beginning of Symphony of the Night.
8351569	8355892	And Van Helsing completely ripped his bean off.
8356472	8356893	I might add.
8358908	8368712	For people that said that Van Helsing was Castlevania the movie, screw you, because honestly, Van Helsing sucked, and a Castlevania movie would be awesome.
8368912	8371573	They would not do that to a Castlevania movie.
8371633	8372793	Actually, they would, that's the problem.
8374194	8378736	There were no flying vampire babies in Castlevania, as far as I'm aware.
8378936	8384178	Now, there were the flying monkeys, but the... Oh, the music is so good.
8384198	8387039	I also want people to pay attention if they happen to make it to the camp.
8387506	8392030	The opening graphic, you'll remember, is exactly the same as it was on Symphony of the Night.
8393411	8397955	Which is funny, because the opening graphic has a little upside-down blue triangle when you play as Richter.
8398476	8401398	But when you play as Maria, it's an upside-down pink triangle.
8402079	8407764	And for you fellow family, aka homos out there, you know what an upside-down pink triangle means.
8414446	8417788	I think I did play something very similar to this on Super Nintendo.
8417808	8422772	Also, Richter should look very familiar to everybody because it's exactly the same sprite used in Symphony of the Night.
8422832	8423112	It is.
8423292	8423812	It seriously is.
8423832	8426974	They actually changed the sprite for the Saturn version to look like his portrait.
8427555	8427815	Huh.
8432778	8433178	You know what?
8433218	8438662	I'm thinking to make this whole thing complete, next week you need to bring the Saturn and Nocturne and the Moonlight.
8438942	8440503	I'll do it.
8443155	8443895	I have a Saturn.
8443995	8445016	I have a few Saturns, actually.
8445036	8446897	I may have a completed save file on that one.
8448037	8448397	Awesome.
8450498	8461622	Now what I love about this part of the game, too, is it looks like she's actually going through the old town in Castle... Oh, and Jamie's saying it is the old town from Castlevania II, Simon's Quest.
8461922	8467945	So for those of you guys that are looking on the webcam right now, you're like, damn, it looks like the same graphics they had in Simon's Quest.
8468025	8468725	Well, it is.
8479298	8481799	It just sounds like a bunch of broken glass everywhere right now.
8481819	8483720	Whoa, hey, what was that?
8484840	8490322	As I mentioned before when we were watching her play this earlier, it sounds like the same sound effects from Mega Man.
8492063	8493584	But they're two different companies!
8493684	8496505	Mega Man is Capcom, Castlevania is Konami.
8496545	8497685	How the hell do you figure?
8497705	8505869	There's a hidden place that I can't get to with Richter.
8506529	8506789	Don't.
8511423	8516466	Anyway, Loki, Castlevania is Konami, Mega Man is Capcom.
8516526	8517966	They cannot share the sound effects.
8519107	8520168	The world would explode.
8523729	8524930	What the hell was that?
8525550	8526291	That was dinner.
8529192	8530493	Jamie says it was the gargoyle.
8534095	8536476	See, it's almost like being at somebody's house.
8537139	8543282	watching them play games, except in this case you have your back turned and you only get to look once every 30 seconds.
8548725	8550006	You just got to wonder what you're missing.
8550126	8551047	Oh, what happened?
8551067	8551647	The music stopped.
8552227	8552928	Oh, load time.
8554989	8556029	Make your own music.
8556169	8556910	Oh, here we go.
8558371	8559551	Are you fighting the boss right now?
8562373	8564214	Yeah, you died last time you fought this boss.
8567455	8568535	This sounds 8-bit.
8568615	8569356	This song sounds 8-bit.
8569476	8571356	Oh.
8572257	8572837	Excuse me.
8578239	8579099	Excuse me again.
8579119	8581780	I don't know what I ate.
8589423	8590703	Loki, stop that.
8592684	8592884	Okay.
8601354	8602134	Jamie died.
8602314	8603675	No, she's not dead yet.
8605136	8609298	Now she's... Did you hear that sound?
8609478	8612400	I swear to God that was the sound it made when you died in like Zelda.
8617423	8618644	You need the axe for this.
8618784	8622146	You always needed the axe for the first boss in any Castlevania game.
8622186	8622686	What's up with that?
8625928	8626228	Alright.
8630208	8630448	What?
8630468	8637310	Alright, Jamie's just trying to get to the next level so you can hear the music, because it is really awesome.
8638891	8640831	And then after that, we're going to go into the FUs of the week.
8641151	8645573	So you guys, by the way, if you're in our chatroom right now, you can send those FUs of the week.
8645893	8649054	Just send a private message to Sky in the chatroom with your FU.
8663547	8664147	Did you kill it?
8664808	8665348	She killed it.
8665388	8666149	Yay!
8666209	8669391	Here we get the disco ball.
8670331	8671412	What's up with the disco ball?
8671472	8674274	Like, the crystal that drops from the ceiling is like a little disco ball.
8674314	8674754	It's crazy.
8676976	8677716	Makes you want to dance.
8679437	8680198	Ooh, it's sparkling.
8681138	8682499	It's a sparkling disco ball.
8683900	8685961	And as you can see, it's a red ball with fire in it.
8687362	8689984	Well, the cam hasn't updated yet, so I can't see it, but... Sorry.
8690304	8690785	That's all right.
8693320	8694021	I know that noise.
8695162	8699505	Believe it or not, I actually like the first level music better on the Super Nintendo version, but all the rest of it's better.
8703088	8705029	Alright, now you have to hear the music at the beginning of the stage.
8705069	8707031	It's the whole reason we played this whole first stage.
8708552	8710193	I forgot I also have sound test open.
8717018	8717719	Sound familiar?
8723644	8726365	Yeah, it's the old school song from like Castlevania 1.
8726685	8727525	It's the first stage.
8727825	8739728	Awesome.
8739808	8742749	It was funny the way the bird squawked right at the pause in the song.
8749111	8749491	Alright.
8750711	8752792	Alright, we're going to wrap it up for this segment.
8754557	8755217	Wait, wait, what?
8755317	8755737	One more thing?
8756657	8756897	Oh, okay.
8757438	8760558	Um, I'm gonna actually play a song that I want to be in my effing music.
8760578	8762359	Okay.
8762379	8762959	Just for this once.
8763299	8764179	Okay, just for this once.
8764219	8765119	But I have to get to it, so.
8765459	8765879	Alright.
8766079	8768420	Well, I'm gonna turn down the volume until you get to that part.
8769020	8769440	Well, great.
8769460	8771000	What are we supposed to talk about in the meantime?
8771040	8771680	I have no idea.
8772461	8772681	Eesh.
8774361	8775241	Now what are we supposed to do?
8775261	8777222	Um, I'm just getting to the sound test.
8777722	8778102	Oh, okay.
8778822	8780362	Well, that won't take that long.
8780502	8780622	No.
8782483	8784243	Just because this is my favorite piece of music in the game.
8785171	8786552	And I forgot the sound test existed.
8786732	8790775	I guess what I'll do for a minute here while I queue up the FUs of the week, which, by the way, you guys should be sitting in.
8791435	8793276	I'll take a moment to plug our spinoff shows.
8793817	8798240	Monday night on Orange Lounge Radio, Diversion, the Orange Lounge Radio remix show.
8798420	8800321	A bunch of your favorite remixes.
8800821	8802442	Not only just... I can hear your computer, buddy.
8803923	8806705	Loki, your computer's coming out the... It is.
8807125	8807466	I hear it.
8808406	8809147	And so do our listeners.
8810808	8811168	Whatever you...
8813658	8815539	Whatever you're working on there, I just heard in my speaker.
8818881	8821463	Listeners, tell Loki you can hear it.
8827147	8828007	Try it again, try it again.
8830669	8831289	I don't hear it now.
8831890	8832230	I hear it.
8833271	8834591	Oh, no, that was the TV right there.
8834611	8834972	Okay.
8835152	8835352	Okay.
8837093	8838935	But I'm telling you, I heard whatever this thing was.
8839535	8842017	It's a, it's a, you're doing a, I can tell what it is.
8842257	8842517	Anyway.
8842858	8843218	Found it.
8843598	8844259	You guys don't care.
8844499	8844739	Anyway.
8845460	8846621	Not yet, not yet, not yet.
8847521	8847942	Keep it down.
8848522	8848763	God.
8849843	8851525	We're going to get into the FUs of the week.
8853666	8858130	Oh yeah, before I, I need to keep finishing up our spin-off programming.
8859231	8859771	I found music.
8860072	8860332	All right.
8860663	8862543	Tuesday night, pump up the volume, 7 o'clock.
8863024	8863284	Or what?
8863304	8865764	It says 7.30 for show, but 6.45-ish for pre-show.
8865864	8867525	Thursday night, outside the box, 7 o'clock.
8867545	8869085	When we feel like doing a show, we do one.
8869445	8872826	Alright, now we can do... Jamie, why do we have to do the FUs of the week every week?
8872926	8875527	Because we're angry, but this music is too happy to be angry about.
8876987	8877207	Ready?
8887990	8888090	Um...
8889048	8891430	I'm angry about the woman with the cookies.
8892110	8894112	Okay, this is the only thing I'm really angry about.
8897234	8906282	There was this, these couple of teenage girls, and I'll be posting a link in the chat room soon, but they went around their neighborhood passing out cookies and they were leaving them on doorsteps with surprises.
8906382	8914268	This one woman sued them for causing her anxiety because they knocked on the door, she didn't answer, and so they left them and ran as a surprise.
8915689	8921751	Well, they offered to pay her medical damages because she did apparently get checked into the hospital for nearly having a heart attack or something.
8922772	8928294	And, uh, instead, uh, she sued them for the punitive damages.
8928334	8932175	Well, she didn't win that, but she did win what the girls offered her anyway.
8932535	8935036	So, it's a big mess.
8935056	8936557	I'm going to post a link to that in my live journal.
8936677	8942559	Also, a big F-you to all of you school children who do not believe in the goddamn First Amendment.
8944629	8952853	There was a survey done that stated something like 80% of students, I think, should believe the government has control over our public media.
8953613	8955374	That's in direct violation of the First Amendment.
8955694	8957915	They also don't know how to properly dispose of the flag, either.
8957935	8961276	They think that flag burning is illegal.
8962016	8963117	I think that that's really stupid.
8963937	8967418	Just a big F you to general ignorance of damn near everybody.
8967679	8968599	And I blame their parents.
8969519	8969839	That's it.
8972561	8973301	Loki's turn.
8977250	8984315	Fuck you this cold, because I've had a sore throat for like an entire week, and that's really the only symptom that I have from that and being congested.
8984915	8992461	So, that kind of sucks, because talking on the phone all day at work, it just irritates it, and that's no picnic.
8993602	8998065	And then, fuck you to stupid, um, lame-ass people with cell phones.
8998525	8999786	God damn it, I want...
9000501	9002783	A law to be passed where people cannot drive with cell phones.
9002843	9010308	In fact, there was a fucking study done that people are more dangerous driving with cell phones than they would be intoxicated.
9010328	9011169	They're making it illegal.
9011869	9012550	Thank God!
9012730	9013391	Because you know what?
9013451	9014772	People can't fucking do it.
9016653	9018514	I've been in a car with you talking on your cell phone.
9018674	9019595	I just use speakerphone.
9021076	9021557	Doesn't matter.
9021717	9026140	Even with speakerphone, the reaction time is much worse.
9026200	9028782	The impending law, though, is supposed to make provisions for hands-free driving.
9030100	9030801	So, you know what?
9031361	9035925	So that goes for all you women out there driving those SUVs and with those stupid cell phones.
9036105	9036425	Ha!
9036686	9037967	You can't do it any longer.
9039428	9040329	To hell with you people.
9040789	9041109	Anyways.
9042330	9045733	Then also, um, fuck you, the goddamn Indian casinos.
9046334	9046634	Actually...
9047153	9071836	because, you know, I think it's quite funny that people go there and spend all their money, oh, look at this, this is nice, because they have, you know, all this, we can go gamble and stuff, but guess what, you don't win, they're just doing a reverse rapage on you, okay, they're just going to rape you of your money, because we raped them of their land, so, you know, I don't feel sorry for anyone that goes there and loses all their money, so to hell with them, and, um,
9073665	9074286	That'll be it.
9074326	9074807	My turn.
9091975	9108866	My first FU goes to Loki for having two FUs that were involving me somehow in some way, because A, I love talking on my cell phone while I drive, and I do it just fine, and B, I lost $75 at the casino last night, but I don't care, I had fun, and I won $100 the last time I was there.
9109206	9116091	But on that note, FU to the fact that I was not able to keep up my winning streak last night, that made me sad, but oh well.
9116331	9121274	I had fun while it lasted, even though it didn't last very long, but then again, neither do orgasms.
9121958	9125499	Um, what else would I give an F you to?
9126059	9130000	An F you to just, like, hangovers, that's a big one.
9130540	9139502	An F you to drama in general, because there's just drama sometimes, and it makes things messy, and that's all I can say about that, really.
9141383	9141963	Let's move on.
9142723	9145544	Let's talk to some of the other folks that are here in studio.
9145684	9145884	Angel.
9147759	9153762	Alright, F you to my instructor because I'm saying I did something that I didn't do.
9154583	9156004	And that's all that needs to be said about that.
9157084	9160086	F you to myself for not giving myself enough sleep during the week.
9160406	9162907	I think that happens to all of us at one point or another.
9165088	9168790	And other than that, not much because I'm not really that angsty.
9168870	9171832	But then again, when am I ever that angsty?
9174153	9176054	You've been like borderline angsty, I've seen.
9177035	9177335	Alright.
9178791	9179572	Uh, Bugged.
9181032	9183233	Just a nice little FU to Loki about freeze pop.
9185634	9186374	You dumb mob ass.
9186394	9188215	He just will not let that drop.
9188735	9190976	He will not drop the freeze pop grudge.
9192077	9192517	Oh boy.
9192837	9194117	No, we're not supposed to drop the mob ass.
9194157	9195018	Everyone's supposed to say it.
9195478	9198539	It's gonna be the next... Death Cake.
9200400	9201320	What the fuck's Death Cake?
9203341	9204082	Is that an Eddie Izzard?
9204742	9205042	Okay.
9205908	9213151	We brought up the cake or death with the vicar or die and death cake.
9213672	9215012	I thought you had a response to that, Loki.
9215052	9215773	That's why I gave you the mic.
9216253	9217033	All right, is that it, bugged?
9218314	9218514	Yeah.
9218694	9218934	All right.
9219454	9220315	Chat room time.
9221215	9222656	Let's see what the folks on chat room have to say.
9222776	9223176	Yeah, I know.
9223196	9223576	Who cares?
9224937	9231560	Illusion says F you to Jamster for just being Jamster and being on every commercial break.
9231580	9232720	You know who owns Jamster?
9232820	9233081	Who?
9233341	9233941	Verisign.
9234898	9235739	You gotta be kidding.
9235879	9239002	No, they're a subsidiary of Rare Science.
9239022	9239383	Jesus.
9239743	9241505	Okay, here you go, guys.
9241525	9245429	There's actually a petition on the internet to stop Jamster, and I would urge you all to sign it.
9245709	9249293	Even though I'm not huge on internet petitions, this is one I can believe in.
9249793	9251875	I don't care if it has, like, minimal impact.
9251915	9255559	If we can stop one Jamster commercial from airing, we've done our job.
9257262	9264986	Illusion also says, an F you to Shakey's, stopping their karaoke right before my friends and I got there so we didn't get to do Love Shack again.
9265347	9269169	Hey, that's the song that Iguana Girl and I always do, is Love Shack.
9269309	9270669	We did it on this show once, actually.
9273831	9274291	K.K.
9274351	9277633	Slider says, F you to Final Fantasy XI, taking my life.
9279694	9280575	I sympathize.
9280635	9281936	What, Jamie, what did you say to K.K.
9281956	9282216	Slider?
9283136	9283396	Addict.
9283436	9284297	Jamie says, Addict.
9286827	9290129	AZN Buddy Paul says, F you to Heartbreakers.
9290809	9295931	There have been like two gazillion breakups lately.
9295991	9297012	Maybe you're just a player.
9298832	9303695	Sephiroth1215 says, F you to No Service Pack 8 yet.
9304315	9308817	And no 2DX in America yet, even though I have a feeling it will be soon.
9308837	9309797	I always say Service Pack.
9310078	9310658	Song Pack 8.
9312597	9317504	Sephiroth 1215 also says, and F you for no outside the box once again.
9317524	9319166	I have more fun on that show.
9319226	9321088	Well, I'm sure the others are pleased to hear that.
9322510	9323211	What can I say?
9323311	9325034	Real life gets in the way sometimes.
9325514	9325975	We'll see.
9326656	9327397	We'll see what happens.
9328007	9331068	Legend of Zaku says, F you to the fact that I'm still unemployed.
9331648	9336049	F you to wasting away my body by not eating right, thus losing my stamina when playing DDR.
9336409	9340689	And F you to Valentine's Day coming up next week, and me still not having a valentine.
9343590	9350091	Jaded2005 says, F you to my computer for acting weird at the worst possible time yesterday while playing Doom 3.
9352552	9353772	And what time would that be?
9353912	9354152	Jeez.
9357219	9358780	I think I had one of those earlier.
9358840	9359360	Uh, the wet ones.
9359400	9362221	DarkLionXVI says, One FU for tonight.
9385187	9391509	FU to EvilNauki2DX for making me spit water on the wall so many times every time he sent me pictures.
9392830	9394730	Would those be 4chan pictures?
9394911	9402393	Well, usually I don't read FUs directed at certain people, but that, you know, I can tell that, you know, that's a light-hearted FU, so those are okay.
9403754	9406775	I know who won the Super Bowl movement, it was the Browns.
9411496	9411916	You're welcome.
9414976	9417717	I thought LankyStyle made the worst jokes possible.
9417737	9418738	Where do you think he learned them from?
9422040	9427704	TheXJasonXV, Resident Webmaster, and Slaveboy will be his official title with the new business structure.
9428425	9429025	F you to work.
9429185	9430446	Constant F you to work.
9430606	9433688	I don't like all the workload being pushed off on me.
9438231	9441814	Right Shannon Joyce says, Joyce says F you to the world.
9445151	9450693	and EvilNauki2DX would like to say one quick FU for Ragnarok Online.
9451413	9452474	Taking my life away.
9453774	9454594	Korean knockoff.
9454914	9458055	It's Ragnarok!
9459416	9465838	Korean life-sucking game, right?
9465858	9471700	Yeah, Ragnarok's another one of those life-sucking MMORPGs that you play and you start going, how did I ever get into this in the first place?
9473078	9485167	I did like Ragnarok though, it was so cute I will play Ragnarok 2 probably and people that know me know that I don't really have a whole lot of time for those other MMORPGs but I will give Ragnarok Online 2 a chance
9487882	9488683	It was adorable.
9489503	9489924	It's cute.
9489944	9495147	I'm sorry, I still had that picture for the longest time on my phone of your mage and my assassin.
9495348	9503013	Seriously, where else could me, a guy, get a character with red spiky hair like I have in real life sometimes and then get a big purple bow to wear in my hair?
9503113	9505055	That bow gave you plus one intelligence.
9505215	9509438	What other MMORPG will let me wear a big purple feminine bow in my hair?
9509538	9512780	And I never did get one of the huge ass ribbons, though.
9512800	9513601	That's what made me sad.
9513621	9516563	You know, I had almost got you one until you said that you quit.
9519136	9521117	I might have come back just for the big ribbon.
9523758	9525039	Wasn't there a cake song about that?
9526760	9527760	I don't... a ribbon?
9529081	9530361	Pretty Pink Ribbon or something like that?
9531062	9531962	Something like that, I don't know.
9533041	9535764	All right, we're going to go to another break here.
9535784	9543933	And when we come back, we're going to head on over to DDR Freak and check out our DDR Chit Chat Post of the Week.
9544013	9546675	And we're going to chit chat about it a little bit here in studio as well.
9547216	9548758	So we're going to do that when we come back.
9549697	9554663	After this break, featuring some more music from 2DX Red.
9555203	9562371	And we're going to start it off with a song that you actually saw in 8th style as well, if you picked up the home version.
9562731	9563592	But it's a good song.
9563953	9565515	It really is a good song, and it's worth playing again.
9565575	9566536	It's Spiral Galaxy.
9567076	9567577	Enjoy, guys.
9567597	9569499	We'll be back with more Orange Launch Radio.
9585149	9586030	Thanks for watching!
9609389	9609969	Thanks for watching!
9634521	9635001	Thanks for watching!
9662376	9663418	Thanks for watching!
9672995	9673515	Thanks for watching!
9704497	9705538	Thanks for watching!
9744969	9745850	Thanks for watching!
9801963	9805227	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura DarkSakura, DarkSakura
9874737	9875721	Thanks for watching!
9933664	9943042	And now, let's listen in to an Orange Lounge Radio staff meeting as they debate some of the new programming coming to Orange Lounge Radio.
9943773	9947857	Jamie, I have a suggestion about some of the music in our Bomani Music and More program.
9947897	9948858	Can we talk about that?
9949138	9951500	No subject will ever be taboo.
9951761	9955404	Well, I was thinking maybe we should move Pump Up the Volume from Tuesday Nights.
9955924	9958467	Except, of course, a subject that was just under discussion.
9958987	9964332	Okay, well, what would you think if maybe we cut back on some of the tack music we play on the station?
9964873	9966174	I collect your fucking head.
9968112	9969613	Just like this fucker here.
9970714	9974398	Oh my god, why did you do that to Loki?
9974678	9978041	The holic thing on episode 69 was just a joke!
9978982	9985428	Now if any of you sons of bitches got anything else to say, now's the fucking time!
9986669	9990393	Orange Lounge Radio, where everybody has a say.
9994810	9998373	You know what else needs to happen when the station changes later this month?
9999615	10000275	New promos.
10001676	10003278	I'm thinking it's about time.
10003438	10004739	I love that promo.
10004799	10005600	Don't get me wrong.
10006081	10007242	But damn, we need some new ones.
10007882	10008303	Seriously.
10008403	10011786	How long have we been using the Captain Jack crying one?
10011966	10012387	Seriously.
10012767	10014529	Since episode six, baby.
10015475	10016956	I like the one that you made based on Dan's old joke.
10044232	10044973	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
10066147	10066788	We don't care.
10067228	10069030	So we're going to have an unofficial contest.
10069090	10072614	And the prize, if you win the contest, is you get your promo plate on the air.
10073495	10073716	What?
10073856	10084468	We will send you autographed the EX-2 and the MAX-2, whatever the work.
10086236	10089177	The Ultramix 2 and the Extreme V-Rares?
10089277	10089577	Yes.
10090917	10093118	I will send you autographed copies.
10093338	10097219	Alright, we will pick our favorites and we will send them autographed copies of the V-Rares.
10097639	10097979	By us.
10098159	10098639	By us.
10098879	10100120	And whoever else we can dig up.
10100160	10102500	Maybe we can get some DDR Freak friends to sign them too.
10105521	10111723	Granted, it's not as good as the Make Edit Get Porn contest, but it will have to do.
10113035	10113595	Thank you for watching!
10125106	10128168	We did have a winner, and the winner at the time was Dave.
10128308	10136053	Those of you who have been listening to the show forever might remember Dave, how he used to come on and listen in the studio with us.
10136173	10137434	How he used to race me home.
10137574	10142777	Him and Paul, but they do not, for some reason, come over anymore.
10142797	10143878	We're not cool anymore.
10143918	10144839	We're not cool anymore.
10147380	10149642	They're probably out screwing girls now, basically.
10149682	10152463	They discovered girls.
10152483	10153464	Puberty hit or something?
10155342	10166830	But anyways, so, he won one of the prizes and I ended up giving him literally a 50 box of porn.
10167851	10173055	And we're talking like, this isn't no small box of porn, this was a giant box of porn.
10175096	10176197	And he earned every bit of it too.
10178922	10180404	DDR Chit Chat Post of the Week
10204170	10213438	That's right, when we get bored on this show and we're desperate for materials, we turn to our buddies over on DDR Freak to provide us with the inspiration we need to keep this show going.
10214740	10218883	And we pick a post from DDR Chit Chat and make it our Post of the Week.
10219404	10230534	Now, it was very tempting to use this as the Post of the Week, which actually was suggested to us by Flairone, which had the subject, Does this girl worth risking?
10231457	10234959	Hi, several months ago I have signed erotic teen site.
10235239	10239060	I have asked owner of this site and he gave me mail one of the models.
10239140	10243122	Her name is Julia and here her free page.
10243562	10247004	How do you think it is possible to have long relation with such models?
10247384	10249485	Is it safe to go Ukraine now for meeting?
10252446	10256748	That sounds amazingly like the Henry Rollins bit about the guy from Hungary.
10259693	10272038	You know, the problem I have with that post, besides the fact it doesn't make any fucking sense, is that we have to have a little bit of a discussion on the post of the week.
10272138	10274339	So, that does not work for the post of the week.
10274379	10274999	I apologize.
10275880	10281242	Now, this was actually, I can't fault this post for wording or grammar or anything.
10281302	10283843	It's actually a pretty interesting post.
10283903	10289325	I gotta ask the folks in chat, or the folks not only in chat, but the folks in studio what they think about this one.
10290671	10300773	This is a post and it's titled, Middle Finger Usage We've all seen people make use of their middle finger in pictures of their DDR accomplishments What's the significance of this?
10303794	10306094	Does it symbolize hate for the song?
10307055	10309515	Does it mean the accomplishment was hard to do?
10310455	10313176	Are they full of rage and don't know where to let it out?
10313857	10315458	Is it the end thing to do?
10316179	10317720	If so, why did it become this way?
10318061	10320903	Do they want to look like rebels, and are they succeeding?
10321604	10324226	Are they conformists who don't even know the significance?
10324906	10328629	I suspect a combination of the last three, but I don't really know.
10330711	10333633	It's telling the song, I fucked your mom, and that's it.
10334014	10334855	That's what it is.
10335875	10339699	More or less, you know, it's like, ha, I fucked your mom, and I triple-A'd you.
10340019	10340259	The end.
10341334	10343735	Is that where the expression, I triple-A'd your mom, comes from?
10343775	10344556	Because I've heard that.
10344796	10347117	I've read that expression a lot on some of the message boards.
10347137	10348498	And I always read that and go, God, you're 14.
10348538	10352059	To be honest, I'm just totally guessing.
10352079	10353500	I have no fucking clue why.
10353900	10355441	I think it's because kids are stupid.
10356021	10360083	I mean, because maybe flashing your penis is illegal.
10360563	10366286	So, you know, flipping off the camera is like, look at me, I'm hardcore and I'm rebellious.
10367567	10367867	I don't know.
10369028	10372949	Jamie, are there any pictures of you on the internet giving the middle finger on a DDR machine?
10373769	10374790	There have been, actually.
10375630	10376010	Why?
10376550	10377630	Why were you giving the finger?
10378010	10379771	I think I was pissed off at the song.
10381391	10382432	It's just a song.
10382732	10384012	What did the song do to you?
10384972	10386413	Fuck your mother.
10389053	10390514	Did the song triple A your mom?
10391094	10393034	Back in the day, possibly, but not currently.
10393975	10395415	Her husband would take exception to that.
10397975	10401396	Bugged, now you've given the middle finger to several DDR machines, right?
10402477	10403097	Sure, why not?
10403717	10404538	I can go do that right now.
10405598	10410040	But are you just giving the middle finger to the DDR machine because you're like fucking losers or what?
10410300	10412001	No, it's because I can't get my zipper down at the same time.
10414182	10416603	You're supposed to laugh, damn it.
10418143	10419684	Here's a quote from the chat room.
10421169	10422850	Wow, that's a really good question.
10423150	10429672	And Illusion says, I'm only going to say this because I know Illusion happens to live in this same area, so I guess he's including himself.
10430052	10433453	Illusion says, all those SoCal people always flip off the camera.
10433493	10434953	They look like such dipshits.
10438454	10439254	I don't know.
10440395	10440895	I don't know why.
10441155	10442495	I mean, I flip off the camera sometimes.
10442535	10444236	I flip off the webcam all the time.
10444636	10447517	I have a picture of me flipping off people wearing a cast.
10449500	10452702	And then I had the cast cut off with hedge cutters.
10452982	10455924	That was one of the few pictures that you posted on Orange Sounds Radio, wasn't it?
10456484	10462067	You know, when I flip you guys off on the webcam... It's a symbol of love.
10462167	10462707	It is.
10462767	10463688	It's a symbol of love.
10463748	10465609	We really fucking love you.
10465649	10467670	Well, what does the word fuck really mean, though?
10467710	10469411	It means, I want to make love to you.
10470410	10473632	So when I flip you guys off on the webcam, I'm saying, I want to make love to you.
10474072	10480636	And when they flip you off when they're playing DDR, they're really saying, I want to make sweet, sweet love to that song I just played.
10482538	10491963	That's not the way I always understand it, especially when there's a lot of cursing that doesn't go with the love, you know, the God damn, doesn't really match.
10492284	10496986	I've triplied that song and I'd like to make sweet, sweet love to your mom or something, I don't know.
10498334	10503338	Maybe Loki just does it because he heard Freeze pop over the intercom when the picture was taken.
10505360	10505700	What now?
10507402	10508123	Do my best!
10510505	10511566	I completely missed that.
10511806	10512586	Yes, yes you did.
10512646	10513027	It's funny.
10514408	10515529	I'm sure it wasn't, but that's okay.
10517798	10519159	And we have a question from the chatroom.
10519200	10521201	Flairone says, you want to make love to me, Sky?
10522202	10524203	In reality, yes, I want to make love to all of you.
10524244	10528987	And there's a good reason for that, because you guys are what have made this station so damn great.
10529187	10531169	And for that, I want to make love to all of you.
10532510	10537534	For those of you guys that are in the chatroom and support this show, DDR Angel's running away right now.
10537574	10538255	Why are you doing that?
10538755	10541117	I didn't mean now, you know, just someday.
10541137	10541217	Okay.
10542082	10543402	In the metaphorical sense.
10543442	10545423	That doesn't mean I actually want to take your club.
10545663	10546804	In the metaphorical sense.
10547344	10548044	You get what I'm saying?
10548664	10551225	Jamie, don't you want to make love to all our listeners in the metaphorical sense?
10551265	10551845	Hell no!
10553046	10554486	Do you know where some of those people have been?
10555026	10555966	Some have been with your mother!
10559227	10562829	Do we have any hot Asian big-breasted chicks listening?
10563629	10563889	I am.
10564029	10564829	Otherwise, you know.
10565810	10567030	I am, and you can't prove that I'm not.
10570288	10593853	Yeah, I think I can, but anyways, um, cause I know it's mostly ad-listing guys, and I'm not into that, so, we need to be hitting up our big-breasted Asian demographic, goddammit, cause this is what we're, like, really hurting on, is the big-breasted female Asian demographic, you know, age range of, you know, 21 to 28.
10596468	10600150	Well, maybe you need to think of a show that would cater to the big-breasted Asian women.
10600610	10601350	Think about this one.
10602210	10602991	Big Booby Chicks.
10606092	10607093	That'd be a BBC show.
10609634	10614036	Well, I could think of a couple ideas for a show.
10614536	10617857	However, they would be very inappropriate for the radio.
10619118	10619658	Like this isn't?
10621351	10628217	Well, I'm trying to back away from making excessive amounts of racial stereotypes.
10628677	10629598	Other people have an idea.
10629718	10630719	Ask G4 how they did it.
10631599	10633981	Now, Rychan and Joyce are sitting there in the chat room.
10634942	10638565	And they're saying, I've got the hot, hot Asian over here.
10639506	10644189	And now they're claiming that there's no... They said, if you don't require big breasts.
10644209	10645931	But I'm thinking the breasts are just fine.
10645971	10648052	I'm thinking that they're just being a little self-deprecating.
10648433	10650034	That's two women over there listening.
10651041	10653222	Hey, that's two out of, you know, whatever.
10653262	10654542	That's a good percentage.
10654743	10655463	It's more than one.
10659745	10660605	Yes, DarkSakura.
10661085	10662025	I'm not commenting.
10663686	10664006	Wise.
10664146	10664767	Very wise.
10665487	10670769	If we have the big boobied Asian women show, we can certainly have the pantsless rage show.
10671129	10671569	That's fine.
10674991	10675471	The what?
10677589	10678089	Old joke.
10678430	10687716	You need to, Loki, you seriously need to register a site, just bigbreastedasianchicksonddr.com Quick, hold his credit card.
10689677	10692179	Maybe, maybe our webmaster can help us make that happen.
10692199	10698583	You know, it's only like, what, nine dollars or something to register a domain name.
10699123	10700084	It's really fucking cheap.
10700484	10702926	I'll just have it point to, you know, Loki Fusion, so.
10707339	10712102	Anyway, now Rychan and Joyce are arguing about their boobies.
10712982	10715164	I don't know, maybe we'll get them on the skyline another week.
10715404	10718025	Sorry guys, but we do have to bring this show to a close.
10718866	10719326	Yes, Loki?
10720006	10723448	I mean, not saying that I'm hating against the Asians with smaller breasts.
10723508	10724589	I mean, that's all good.
10725790	10727171	I mean, you can't hate on it.
10728171	10731333	Like they say, any more than a handful is a waste.
10731693	10733734	So, or was that a mouthful?
10733895	10734475	I can't remember.
10734495	10736416	I think it was a mouthful, yes.
10738489	10740550	and we're getting a post to our website here.
10740570	10746252	It says www.bigbreastedasians.com I'm sure that site already exists, people.
10746352	10747052	I'm sure it does.
10747812	10748672	Here's the catch, though.
10748772	10754534	Big Breasted Asians playing DDR is the catch.
10754774	10755215	Oh, it doesn't?
10755555	10758356	Bigbreastedasians.com doesn't exist?
10762117	10762497	Wow.
10762517	10762577	Wow.
10764324	10768708	We need to register big-breasted Asians and have it point to Orange Lounge Radio.
10772511	10777536	Big-breasted Asian women playing DDR.com certainly doesn't have a thing.
10779117	10779418	Alright.
10779438	10781099	Alright.
10781139	10782280	Loki's going to work on that.
10782420	10785163	I can't believe big-breasted Asians isn't registered.
10785783	10788586	Somebody can get us that for Christmas and have it point to Orange Lounge Radio.
10791500	10796283	Seriously, I will point that to Orange Lounge Radio if I can do that.
10798045	10801328	I will seriously... Wait, it's like only a few bucks.
10801408	10802368	I mean, I could do that.
10802849	10803369	That'd be funny.
10806071	10810235	Oh, actually, Jason says BigBreastedAsians.com does exist.
10810335	10810835	He checked.
10811396	10812717	I just checked and it wasn't there.
10814338	10815639	It may be registered.
10815679	10817061	It may be registered with no website.
10817561	10818762	That's probably it then.
10820493	10825975	Alright, I would have a hard time believing that BigBreastedAsians.com wouldn't exist.
10826955	10834277	Now maybe there could be like BigTittiedAsians or BigJuggedAsians or well, you know what, we really need to end this show at this point, I'm thinking.
10836618	10840499	In order to do that, we have to go around and get everybody's final thought.
10841079	10842000	Bud, your final thought.
10842340	10843020	Puppy Bowl.
10844560	10846461	And TDR Angel, your final thought.
10848001	10850062	Um, I don't have one, sorry.
10852079	10854120	DarkSakura... Actually, Loki, your final thought.
10856460	10860702	I hope that battery doesn't explode when I'm done charging it and plug it into the monitor.
10861262	10864703	So it's like I've had really bad luck with batteries.
10865203	10865764	Lick it first.
10867364	10871966	My final thought is you better take that shit outside when you plug it in the first time in case you start any fires.
10872686	10873686	DarkSakura, your final thought.
10874106	10876687	Japanese games that have intros in German are awesome.
10878268	10878808	Second thought.
10880202	10881682	Tonight's final word.
10881782	10887763	I'm going to give the final word of the show tonight to DDR Angel because she hasn't said shit tonight so she needs to get at least one word in.
10888763	10890164	And thank you guys very much for listening.
10890504	10891684	We will see you next week.

10936853	10938633	Screw you!

10947635	10949536	Behold my Patrick Duffy legs.
10949816	10950596	Are you threatening me?
10950836	10952357	Go home, you little dildo.
10952557	10954477	You will give me tippy, Bungholio.
10954757	10956097	Kick him in the nads, Beavis.

11016413	11018053	Another school week about ready to start.
11020615	11021355	Sadness.
11022216	11022416	What?
11023817	11024237	What, Angel?
11026658	11030160	I just whispered the death game and he didn't even say anything.
11030640	11031561	Because I couldn't hear you.
11032661	11035463	Well, yeah, it was supposed to be like a seven days type whisper thing.
11037724	11039265	Jamie, you look like you're about to say something over there.
11041246	11041726	LighterMouth
