And I'll tell you what, you take another list of some of these songs when it's on the actual soundtrack

07:47.020 --> 07:50.520
And they've kind of the levels of some instruments are up a little and down

07:50.520 --> 07:55.660
It's all cleaner and it's nice and crisp and clear when you listen to this on the soundtrack a lot of these songs are just

07:56.020 --> 08:01.500
Awesome, so we're going to be playing some stuff from the official soundtrack tonight. We're going to start it off with a song called

08:02.440 --> 08:07.340
Injection of love I love this song this is this is the one that has the f-word in it so listen for it

08:07.340 --> 08:11.020

13:49.700 --> 13:53.700
What so proudly we hailed

13:53.700 --> 13:57.700
at the twilight's last gleaming.

13:57.700 --> 14:01.700
What so proudly we hailed

17:03.300 --> 17:04.960
Some great songs in there.

17:04.960 --> 17:09.200
That last song you guys heard was actually, I think it was one of the songs that you actually,

17:09.200 --> 17:13.040
it was like an unlock or release later song, 2Dx Red, I could be wrong on that, but I know

17:13.040 --> 17:19.180
that song didn't come out until after a lot of the others, Ryu, with an, it's, forgive

17:19.180 --> 17:24.440
me if I pronounce this wrong, it's just a-gee-ha, or something like that, A-G-E-H-A, a-gee-ha.

17:24.440 --> 17:25.440
A-gee-ha.

17:25.440 --> 17:26.440
I think so.

17:26.440 --> 17:34.240
that the song sphere from 2d x11 pretty cool song evo 66 which by the way is by

17:34.240 --> 17:38.800
the same group that did North from 2d x4 style you guys remember that song it was

17:38.800 --> 17:48.160
like very I don't know like like Renaissance fair rave type song I really

17:48.160 --> 17:52.240
don't know how to explain that song well let me play a little bit of North okay

17:52.240 --> 18:04.840
Okay, here's a little, like, clip of North from 2DX4 style.

18:04.840 --> 18:21.440
Kinda, like, happy, like, fluid or something, and then they go from that to this.

18:21.440 --> 18:30.480
this is a little more Rave-ish, I don't know. I don't know, how do you get from point A

18:30.480 --> 18:36.560
to point B? I have no idea. All right. And then starting that set off, Injection of Love,

18:36.560 --> 18:42.840
the song where she says, Fook me. What the Fook is going on over there, you guys? What

18:42.840 --> 18:46.040
are you guys? No, we're just Fooking around. Oh, okay. What are you Fooking doing? What

18:46.040 --> 18:52.640

18:52.640 --> 18:58.440
picture. Alright, anyway. Let the joke die! Alright. Ah, we're gonna start off tonight

18:58.440 --> 19:01.280
showing us what we do every week, playing a little bit of How Was Your Week, How Was

19:01.280 --> 19:05.760
Your Day, your chance to catch up with us and what we've been doing. It's better than

19:05.760 --> 19:12.760
LiveJournal, really. Jamie, how was your week, how was your day? Um, my week was pretty okay.

19:12.760 --> 19:14.480
It was, work was great.

19:14.480 --> 19:16.720
I love my job now.

19:16.720 --> 19:20.720
You know, I made a comment to my boss that I had no job stress.

19:20.720 --> 19:24.600
He was like, what was this business where I was like, no, there's a difference between

19:24.600 --> 19:28.420
having a lot of work to do and having emotional stress, and I don't have any of that at my

19:28.420 --> 19:29.420
job now.

19:29.420 --> 19:30.580
So it's been really great.

19:30.580 --> 19:31.960
I can go to work happy.

19:31.960 --> 19:33.520
I can leave happy.

19:33.520 --> 19:35.440
I can be happy all day at work.

19:35.440 --> 19:36.600
How many people can say that?

19:36.600 --> 19:38.680
When I got my last promotion, I felt the exact same way.

19:38.680 --> 19:46.360
I went from feeling useless to feeling good about what I did.

19:46.360 --> 19:48.320
I literally felt useless in my old position.

19:48.320 --> 19:51.360
In my old position I had the evil VP who I hoped dies.

19:51.360 --> 19:53.360
I liked everybody I worked with.

19:53.360 --> 19:57.820
I don't think I've really worked with any bad people unless they were people who weren't

19:57.820 --> 19:58.820
there very long.

19:58.820 --> 20:00.000
I enjoy my entire team.

20:00.000 --> 20:04.880
I've had the fortune of working with good people, but that doesn't always mean that

20:04.880 --> 20:07.640
I was doing the best kind of work, you know what I mean?

20:07.640 --> 20:13.140
My work is really easy, it's all spreadsheets and computer stuff that I don't have to really...

20:13.140 --> 20:17.060
I can listen to my music, as long as I can listen to my music and do my work, I'm a happy

20:17.060 --> 20:18.060
bunny.

20:18.060 --> 20:19.060
And what do you do?

20:19.060 --> 20:20.060
You listen to a fan of the opera while you work?

20:20.060 --> 20:21.060
Dude, I was.

20:21.060 --> 20:25.060
And one of my co-workers came up and goes, oh my god, this is awesome, so which track

20:25.060 --> 20:26.060
are you on?

20:26.060 --> 20:30.060
She tried to figure out what track I was listening to by the playlist.

20:30.060 --> 20:34.860
I want to know, is it timed so that when you walk in the door, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo,

20:34.860 --> 20:35.860
doo, doo.

20:35.860 --> 20:36.860
When I'm driving, yes.

20:36.860 --> 20:40.240
That's how I wake up in the morning is by putting in my Phantom of the Opera soundtrack.

20:40.240 --> 20:44.060
That should be somebody's alarm in the morning.

20:44.060 --> 20:48.740
Like, can you imagine you're resting all peacefully and then the sun's coming up and then your CD player kicks in

20:48.740 --> 20:49.760
and it's at max volume?

20:49.760 --> 20:53.120
Doooooo! Do do do do doooooo!

20:53.120 --> 20:56.380
That would be awesome. I should do that again one day.

20:56.380 --> 20:59.380
You just have to be very funny chandeliers.

20:59.380 --> 21:02.580
Yeah, it's so loud the chandelier falls. Ha ha ha. Anyway.

21:02.580 --> 21:06.780
And in our case it would be the halogen lamp falls over.

21:06.780 --> 21:11.780
Um, it turns out it was the cat after all. She's, you know, the cat.

21:11.780 --> 21:12.780
Your cat's playing?

21:12.780 --> 21:15.780
The cat's the bantam.

21:15.780 --> 21:17.780
How do you tune your cats?

21:17.780 --> 21:21.780
Kick her.

21:21.780 --> 21:25.780
I don't know. She wakes, I swear I wake up to the cat in the face.

21:25.780 --> 21:26.780
Meow.

21:26.780 --> 21:28.780
Mom, feed me.

21:28.780 --> 21:29.780
Meow.

21:29.780 --> 21:30.780
Meow.

21:30.780 --> 21:31.780
Meow.

21:31.780 --> 21:32.780
Meow.

21:32.780 --> 21:33.780
Meow.

21:33.780 --> 21:34.780
Meow.

21:34.780 --> 21:35.780
Meow.

21:35.780 --> 21:39.120
on your face this week? She's been sleeping under the covers. Okay, that's good, because

21:39.120 --> 21:42.100
I remember last week, Shermie had slipped on your face the night before. You were kind

21:42.100 --> 21:46.660
of out of it last week. I was on lots of drugs. Yeah. Lots of drugs. I mean, if I had had

21:46.660 --> 21:51.860
pussy in my face all night long, I'd probably be... You'd need drugs. I'd need a lot of

21:51.860 --> 21:57.740
drugs, honey. Well, anyway, um, we had Guitar Freaks hooked up, so we've been playing Guitar

21:57.740 --> 22:03.180
Freaks all week. Oh yeah? Um, I finally... Are you pissed off that they never released

22:03.180 --> 22:07.860
any new ones on PlayStation? Dan is, but we're looking for the second I pen now. Okay. But

22:07.860 --> 22:13.260
I finally, finally passed Liar Liar all the way through. Yay. I'm not really all that

22:13.260 --> 22:19.500
great at Guitar Freaks. But I can pass Carnival Day like it's a, you know, nothing. That was

22:19.500 --> 22:25.460
one of the bonus tracks from Fifth. Why, why will they not put Guitar Freaks 5, it's Guitar

22:25.460 --> 22:30.380
Freaks 5 isn't out for home, right? Yeah, it is. I thought Guitar Freaks 4... It's the

22:30.380 --> 22:40.380
one that was Guitadora. Guitar Freaks 5, Germania 4. I thought that they stopped with 4.3. I

22:40.380 --> 22:44.820
think it's 4.3 is where they stopped. Okay, no, you're right. It's 3 seconds and then

22:44.820 --> 22:49.860
4.3. 4.3. And then 5.4 is the one they really need to do. Like, all of my favorite Guitar

22:49.860 --> 22:54.140
Freak songs were on 5th. And then 6. And there's, you know, there's good ones as the series

22:54.140 --> 22:59.140
It depends on you though on the 4th, 3rd, and Liar Liar and Dynamite.

22:59.140 --> 23:04.140
I'm not saying there's bad songs, but I'm just saying all the songs I want to play,

23:04.140 --> 23:09.900
what would make me get a guitar, little controller and all that stuff, cause I would never get

23:09.900 --> 23:14.660
a drum set at home type thing, it's just, I just, I really suck at Drummania and it's

23:14.660 --> 23:18.460
not that game I want to get better at.

23:18.460 --> 23:20.140
Good for you, but not for me.

23:20.140 --> 23:21.500
I got it pretty cheap too.

23:21.500 --> 23:25.060
guitar freaks is kind of fun I like out I love what I love about guitar freaks

23:25.060 --> 23:28.180
is the cheesy side of me I love how you get bonus points for when you do the

23:28.180 --> 23:32.620
whale like you know lift the guitar up like you're a rock star okay I'm lame

23:32.620 --> 23:44.280
whatever I shoot myself in the head like a rock star but no what else mainly you

23:44.280 --> 23:47.500
know in a did school doing a project for my art class it's supposed to be my

23:47.500 --> 23:50.500
midterm so we're starting it now because we're not gonna have a test we're just

23:50.500 --> 23:56.420
going to do a project. And I have to take, I told you about this earlier, but you take

23:56.420 --> 24:01.820
a picture from a magazine, you have to redo it as a pencil contour drawing, and then redo

24:01.820 --> 24:10.460
it as a ink contour, then do an ink wash version of the picture, ContiCrayon, oil pastel, water

24:10.460 --> 24:19.740
color, there's another one that I'm forgetting, charcoal, which I hate charcoal, and another

24:19.740 --> 24:24.460
version. The same painting over and over. Yeah. And so far I'm almost done with my charcoal

24:24.460 --> 24:31.660
one. My Conti-Cran one's almost done. That leaves me the ink wash, oil pastel, watercolor,

24:31.660 --> 24:38.720
and then the random one. You basically reinvent the picture. I am a horrible, horrible artist.

24:38.720 --> 24:44.020
I will never take an art class. It's the one thing I was not meant to do ever in my life

24:44.020 --> 24:50.220
was taken our class. Sorry. I'm helping with the other thing that I brought today. The

24:50.220 --> 24:58.500
other thing that my house has been taken up with has been Dracula X on the TurboDuo. And

24:58.500 --> 25:04.900
I have, for later on today, brought that. Okay, we'll talk about that later. Been doing

25:04.900 --> 25:11.860
lots of retro gaming in the house. We've been playing Tengen Tetris. Why? It sucked. No,

25:11.860 --> 25:18.600
I didn't like it. I did I did not get the big deal with Tang and Tetris. I mean sure it has cooperative place

25:18.980 --> 25:22.140
Okay, I'll give you that it does have the multi the better multiplayer

25:22.140 --> 25:27.780
But the music was better in the Nintendo and the graphics were better and it was cutesier. It was it was Nintendo five

25:28.340 --> 25:34.700
Tang and Tetris had cooperative play which makes it all worth it, but Tang and Tetris outside of that was really ghetto

25:34.700 --> 25:41.580
It looked like Commodore 64 Tetris. No, worse. It looked like Atari 800 Tetris.

25:41.580 --> 25:45.860
Well, it was made by Atari. Yeah, and it looked like they took a direct

25:45.860 --> 25:50.060
port from the Atari 800. I mean, it's still cool because it's like,

25:50.060 --> 25:55.500
ooh, the game that was like banned in a court of law, you know, type thing.

25:55.500 --> 25:59.900
They can't make this game anymore. For that reason, it's cool, but still, it's

25:59.900 --> 26:04.660
not the best Tetris game, in my opinion. The one on Game Boy was really the greatest

26:04.660 --> 26:08.660
I'm one of the shining stars of my collection.

26:08.660 --> 26:12.660
Understandable. What about your cartridge of Custer's Revenge?

26:12.660 --> 26:16.660
We don't have a cartridge of Custer's Revenge. You need one.

26:16.660 --> 26:20.660
We've got a ROM of it. Actually, I take that back. We have a ROM chip of it.

26:20.660 --> 26:24.660
Almost, okay, the ROM chip is cool, but as far as the ROM

26:24.660 --> 26:28.660
on the computer goes, almost everybody that's ever emulated Atari 2600

26:28.660 --> 26:32.660
on their PC, the first thing they go and download is Custer's Revenge.

26:32.660 --> 26:34.660
And X-Man.

26:34.660 --> 26:37.660
Custer's Revenge, X-Man, and Adventure.

26:37.660 --> 26:39.660
Or E.T.

26:39.660 --> 26:41.660
E.T. is horrible, I actually own E.T.

26:41.660 --> 26:45.660
Because people usually remember Adventure and E.T. for two very different reasons.

26:45.660 --> 26:47.660
E.T. is the worst game ever.

26:47.660 --> 26:51.660
And Adventure probably for most people the best game ever that they played.

26:51.660 --> 26:53.660
Or Yars' Revenge.

26:53.660 --> 26:57.660
Pac-Man was the second worst game ever.

26:57.660 --> 27:01.660
Isn't that interesting that Yars' Revenge and E.T. had a lot of the same staff?

27:01.660 --> 27:04.660
And one's the worst game ever, and one's the best game ever?

27:04.660 --> 27:07.660
Um, I went to the panel that they did at Classic Gaming Expo.

27:07.660 --> 27:09.660
Oh, I should have gone to that.

27:09.660 --> 27:10.660
A lot of those guys.

27:10.660 --> 27:11.660
Was that this year, or was that last year?

27:11.660 --> 27:12.660
Battlezone, that was this past year.

27:12.660 --> 27:13.660
Was it?

27:13.660 --> 27:17.660
Battlezone, and um, quite a number of other games.

27:17.660 --> 27:18.660
Defender.

27:18.660 --> 27:20.660
That was pretty cool.

27:22.660 --> 27:26.660
But um, yesterday I hung out with Iguana Girl.

27:26.660 --> 27:27.660
We went shopping.

27:27.660 --> 27:29.660
Had dinner.

27:29.660 --> 27:34.660
I burned a bunch, I mean, made pictures of a bunch of DVDs on the night.

27:34.660 --> 27:38.660
I thought she was going to say she burned a bunch of forest or something.

27:38.660 --> 27:40.660
I burned a bunch of people.

27:40.660 --> 27:44.660
And played more of the Final Fantasy game.

27:44.660 --> 27:48.660
Well, you at the mall, I can imagine you wanted to burn down some people.

27:48.660 --> 27:50.660
Did you walk by any girls that were all shopping together?

27:50.660 --> 27:53.660
Oh my god, oh my god, you're going to look so cute in that. Oh my god.

27:53.660 --> 27:56.660
The mall was busy like Christmas busy. It was insane.

27:56.660 --> 28:00.660
It was everyone teaming up for the Super Bowl.

28:00.660 --> 28:04.660
Damn! More of the S-word! The Stupid Bowl!

28:04.660 --> 28:08.660
Here's what it is. Since the Stupid Bowl was going on today,

28:08.660 --> 28:12.660
and all the women knew they'd have to be in the kitchen today, they went to the mall yesterday.

28:12.660 --> 28:16.660
Okay, you know what? This is, you know, the zeroes.

28:16.660 --> 28:20.660
I'm just kidding.

28:20.660 --> 28:24.660
People better get some liberation going on.

28:24.660 --> 28:30.600
nachos get their own damn beer I'm just kidding with you I like getting y'all

28:30.600 --> 28:43.080
riled up I like that I like burning a fire on you what what what what what are

28:43.080 --> 28:51.360
you done are you done are you done what hey you

28:51.360 --> 28:53.080
You weren't high.

28:53.080 --> 28:55.120
You are high.

28:55.120 --> 28:56.120
Anything else?

28:56.120 --> 28:57.280
I'm high on that.

28:57.280 --> 28:58.280
Anything else?

28:58.280 --> 28:59.280
No.

28:59.280 --> 29:00.280
Let's keep the show going, people.

29:00.280 --> 29:05.600
Oh, other than stupid cookie woman, but I'm bringing that up during the FUs.

29:05.600 --> 29:06.600
Stupid cookie woman.

29:06.600 --> 29:08.080
Reading about the stupid cookie woman.

29:08.080 --> 29:09.680
All right, I'll have to hear about this later.

29:09.680 --> 29:12.720
No, it's about the two girls who baked all the cookies for her neighborhood and then

29:12.720 --> 29:15.240
the one woman sued them.

29:15.240 --> 29:16.560
Huh.

29:16.560 --> 29:20.180
I will be discussing that later.

29:20.180 --> 29:24.140
we talk about the stupid Bowl for a minute sure I hate it but go ahead I

29:24.140 --> 29:27.900
well I'm just I'm surprised we have this many people listening tonight with that

29:27.900 --> 29:34.860
whole thing going on but what is your grudge against the stupid Bowl Jamie it's

29:34.860 --> 29:40.820
like a bastardized version of rugby at least rugby has men getting bloody

29:40.820 --> 29:50.980
wearing shorts big advantages there real football soccer and on top of that it's

29:50.980 --> 29:54.820
just another excuse for millions and millions of Americans to sit on their

29:54.820 --> 30:00.380
lazy asses drink beer and scream obscenities at their TV that's a

30:00.380 --> 30:03.240
different than the other Sunday night yeah I was gonna say instead we

30:03.240 --> 30:10.060
encourage you to we are encouraging our listeners to sit home drink juice and

30:10.060 --> 30:15.640
and uh... sit and listen to obscenities be screamed at them

30:15.640 --> 30:18.280
you know if i was one screaming the obscenities at them that would be

30:18.280 --> 30:20.200
worthwhile

30:20.200 --> 30:24.500
what's stopping you

30:24.500 --> 30:26.480
i need a really big megaphone

30:26.480 --> 30:30.040
you're not even into the uh... commercials at all

30:30.040 --> 30:31.220
no cause they're stupid

30:31.220 --> 30:32.900
and uh...

30:32.900 --> 30:36.320
the halftime show the wardrobe malfunctions no

30:36.320 --> 30:38.380
no this year was Paul McCartney

30:38.380 --> 30:40.380
I would have watched that.

30:40.380 --> 30:43.380
Yeah, if he had a wardrobe malfunction, I'm sure there would have been coverage.

30:43.380 --> 30:45.380
I'm sure his wife would have been.

30:45.380 --> 30:51.380
Can you imagine Paul McCartney like having a wardrobe malfunction where like a ball falls out or something?

30:51.380 --> 30:53.380
That's disgusting!

30:53.380 --> 30:54.380
I seriously doubt it.

30:54.380 --> 30:57.380
I would petition the FCC myself.

30:57.380 --> 31:04.380
I bet you Saturday Live is going to get him next time and he's going to have a wardrobe malfunction like Janet where his shirt rips off or something.

31:04.380 --> 31:06.380
That's disgusting.

31:06.380 --> 31:12.580
shirt ripped off? What? Uh-oh. You broke something, you fixed it.

31:12.580 --> 31:15.980
My previous... Well, are you done? Are you done?

31:15.980 --> 31:20.100
I guess so! Well, are you done?

31:20.100 --> 31:27.100
I guess so. Fine. I guess I'll go then.

31:27.140 --> 31:32.140
You're done since you said you're done. I just said I guess so, I didn't say I was

31:32.140 --> 31:35.740
done. See, this is my pet peeve about women. They

31:35.740 --> 31:39.740
They don't fucking come out and say yes or no. They always have to go, maybe.

31:39.740 --> 31:43.740
Fine! I'm done!

31:43.740 --> 31:47.740
Speak!

31:47.740 --> 31:51.740
Anyways, I just fixed the monitor because it wasn't working.

31:51.740 --> 31:55.740
And my previous assumption of there's two sets of cords going

31:55.740 --> 31:59.740
to the screen, and I thought one of them was for the standard

31:59.740 --> 32:03.740
composite input. You have to set up your story because you can't

32:03.740 --> 32:05.740
I can't assume that every-

32:05.740 --> 32:07.740
I was getting there, okay?

32:07.740 --> 32:09.740
Alright, alright.

32:09.740 --> 32:11.740
Anyway.

32:11.740 --> 32:13.740
It worked exactly like I thought.

32:13.740 --> 32:15.740
So when I unplugged something, it worked perfectly.

32:15.740 --> 32:19.740
So, now the monitor works and I'm happy.

32:19.740 --> 32:23.740
But because I tried cutting something off of the Dremel tool, I accidentally grinded something out.

32:23.740 --> 32:28.740
So anyways, the monitor thing, this is for that computer that I'm building that's inside of an Xbox.

32:28.740 --> 32:38.740
The monitor itself is a old PlayStation 1 monitor, LCD thing, that's like 5 inch, and right now we have the TurboDuo on there, so...

32:38.740 --> 32:42.740
Are we gonna be able to play Final Fantasy XI on it?

32:42.740 --> 32:50.740
Um, you know, to be honest, I could do that, but not on that computer. You're not gonna be able to play Final Fantasy XI on that computer.

32:50.740 --> 32:51.740
No!

32:51.740 --> 32:54.740
That computer is way too weak.

32:54.740 --> 33:02.740
You can play Final Fantasy on the emulator, Final Fantasy 3, or 6.

33:02.740 --> 33:04.740
Hurray.

33:04.740 --> 33:08.740
You can play Fantasy Star Online.

33:08.740 --> 33:12.740
I don't even know if the computer is powerful enough to handle that. Probably not.

33:12.740 --> 33:16.740
It's only like, what, 1 gigahertz? So.

33:16.740 --> 33:19.740
I'll be lucky if I can play Leisure Suit Larry on it.

33:19.740 --> 33:23.740
Oh, you can play the original one. That's nothing.

33:23.740 --> 33:26.500
Yeah, so that's what I've been working on for the last few days

33:29.280 --> 33:31.840
The rest of the week was me being sick and

33:34.960 --> 33:41.180
Just playing a lot of Final Fantasy we went to the buffet yesterday and that was fun because I hadn't been there and

33:43.920 --> 33:45.920
What else oh

33:47.020 --> 33:50.240
That's pretty much it just people quitting at my work now

33:50.240 --> 33:56.420
that's funny because they're going to be screwed and I don't care and yeah it's

33:56.420 --> 34:02.400
just that kind of thing that's all that happened to me all righty let's hear

34:02.400 --> 34:08.320
from DDR angel how was your week how's your day not much just a lot of school

34:08.320 --> 34:13.200
and homework and you know the usual stuff working and running into creepy

34:13.200 --> 34:19.000
guys it fries on Tuesday nights yes running into you know actually it was

34:19.000 --> 34:32.000
It was kind of funny, I went over to Fry's on Tuesday and aside from watching 23rd Magus play DDR, again, because he always has to stop there for some reason just to show off or whatever.

34:32.000 --> 34:35.000
Okay, not really show off, just play.

34:35.000 --> 34:44.000
So, I was looking for a new speaker set and just some other stuff that I needed and I ran into BUGS! And that was fun.

34:44.000 --> 34:46.000
Yes, and I recovered perfectly fine, thank you.

34:46.000 --> 34:49.000
What did I do? I did nothing!

34:49.000 --> 34:50.000
Yeah, you said you ran into me.

34:50.000 --> 34:52.000
Yes, I did. No, no, no, no, no.

34:52.000 --> 34:54.000
That would be 23rd Magus running into you.

34:54.000 --> 34:55.000
Puppy porn? What?

34:55.000 --> 34:57.000
I don't want to know, okay, um...

34:57.000 --> 34:59.000
It's the puppy bowl!

34:59.000 --> 35:00.000
...sidebar conversation edit now. Okay.

35:00.000 --> 35:01.000
Puppies don't have bowls?

35:01.000 --> 35:03.000
Um, not much other than that.

35:03.000 --> 35:07.000
I really wish that I could play, uh, Pwner Finishing Alert this week, but, um...

35:07.000 --> 35:11.000
Homework kind of got into the way, uh, into the way and all that stuff.

35:11.000 --> 35:15.000
So, this week hopefully I will get things done, um...

35:15.000 --> 35:21.460
probably tonight or tomorrow and then I can play with everyone yay and that'd be

35:21.460 --> 35:25.580
it be gentle when you play with all of us

35:26.580 --> 35:30.580
how was your week how was your day I ran into this creepy person at fries on

35:30.580 --> 35:42.260
Tuesday night I'm not creepy I'm angelic I wasn't talking about you he's creepy

35:42.260 --> 35:48.260
He gave me this weird eye, like damn I know you. I gave him the weird eye, like I do know you.

35:48.260 --> 35:54.260
Well, I would call it something, but then... yeah. Never mind.

35:54.260 --> 35:57.260
I'll just call it the eyebrow.

36:00.260 --> 36:03.260
Anyway, other than that, how was your week in the day?

36:03.260 --> 36:09.260
I ended up in San Jose yesterday for a birthday party. Lots of video games and other various games.

36:09.260 --> 36:10.260
Yes, how did that go?

36:10.260 --> 36:14.820
that went pretty well. Mm-hmm. And got back at like 2 a.m. beat my brother home.

36:14.820 --> 36:20.220
It was working. Uh-huh. He kind of, he was kind of surprised to see his big brother

36:20.220 --> 36:24.060
sitting at the computer in the kitchen when he walked in at 3 a.m. Can't blame

36:24.060 --> 36:27.500
him. I'd be surprised too if somebody was sitting at the computer in my kitchen at

36:27.500 --> 36:35.240
3 a.m. And, let's see. Picked up two video games today. The toy locator store over at the

36:35.240 --> 36:39.560
outlets had buy one get one fifty percent off so I got

36:39.560 --> 36:43.080
Civ III and Douglas Adams Titanic

36:43.080 --> 36:46.480
two games I've really wanted to play for a long time

36:46.480 --> 36:50.360
now I can actually afford them. I'm curious about Civ III like I haven't

36:50.360 --> 36:51.040
really played it

36:51.040 --> 36:55.280
Oh well, if you want to give it a test drive. Yeah, I might have to try that out

36:55.280 --> 36:58.760
I heard that Civ III was

36:58.760 --> 37:03.400
a little more like Civ I than Civ II was because Civ II was too much for me

37:03.400 --> 37:09.320
like I, oh my god, like it's too complicated. Sim 1's bad enough, but Sim 2 is like, oh

37:09.320 --> 37:14.320
my god! But somebody told me that Sim 3 is a little, a little easier, but I hope that's

37:14.320 --> 37:19.840
true. Nothing beats Populous though. Populous was cool because you could drown people by

37:19.840 --> 37:25.320
just taking away all the land. If you guys have never played Populous, check it out sometime,

37:25.320 --> 37:28.580
seriously. But it was out for what, SNES? Yeah, it was out on Super, I owned it on Super

37:28.580 --> 37:31.920
Nintendo, okay? I thought we had it for the computer as well. Yeah, it was out on the

37:31.920 --> 37:36.940
the computer as well. It was really a computer game too. It was one of those games that some

37:36.940 --> 37:41.320
genius decided they were going to port from PC to Super Nintendo. Although the game really,

37:41.320 --> 37:47.100
really was not designed to be played on the console. But you tried anyway. And that's

37:47.100 --> 37:51.780
how it was on Super Nintendo. The game was awesome. Drowning your own people are the

37:51.780 --> 37:56.460
best. My week's been pretty damn boring. And Tuesday is going to be a very interesting

37:56.460 --> 38:03.620
day with the funeral. A lot of people from the past life have come out of the woodwork.

38:03.620 --> 38:09.620
That's tomorrow? Tuesday. Tuesday. I, well, yeah. Your work. I'll talk to you, well, yeah,

38:09.620 --> 38:18.620
there's that and, you know, I just, I don't like funerals. I really, really don't, so,

38:18.620 --> 38:23.620
But other than that, nope, which is pretty standard.

38:23.620 --> 38:25.620
Alright, fair enough.

38:25.620 --> 38:27.620
My week and my day, I guess it's my turn.

38:27.620 --> 38:29.620
Okay, I want to expand on the buffet thing.

38:29.620 --> 38:32.620
We went to Thunder Valley Casino, which is this little Indian casino.

38:32.620 --> 38:33.620
Well, it's not really little.

38:33.620 --> 38:39.620
It's this big Indian casino that is somewhere between here, where we are in Sacramento,

38:39.620 --> 38:43.620
and Reno, which is where all the gambling used to happen.

38:43.620 --> 38:47.620
But now that they have this new Indian casino, that's where everybody in this area goes to gamble,

38:47.620 --> 38:51.700
Reno is practically going bankrupt because of it but I went there and they

38:51.700 --> 38:58.560
have this huge buffet it's so good and I swear that the buffet at a place like

38:58.560 --> 39:02.240
that is the only place where you could just get like like Loki brought back a

39:02.240 --> 39:08.500
dish from the buffet he had egg flour soup and two two pieces of corn from the

39:08.500 --> 39:12.580
buffet and I'm just like only only at a buffet like I brought back one plate

39:12.580 --> 39:18.500
that had like this really good tortellini on it, and coconut shrimp. And I think my

39:18.500 --> 39:23.420
buddy Christopher put it best, the coconut shrimp tasted like a Krispy Kreme donut. It

39:23.420 --> 39:27.660
was so good. And I love coconut shrimp, I had so much coconut yesterday, I had that,

39:27.660 --> 39:31.860
and I had a coconut cream pie. Sorry, am I making you guys hungry? I'm sorry. I ate so

39:31.860 --> 39:41.420
much, I was so full. And then I lost $75 in the casino. Go me, I rock. And, Loki, how

39:41.420 --> 39:46.500
How long would you say it took me to lose $75?

39:46.500 --> 39:47.500
About ten minutes.

39:47.500 --> 39:48.500
About ten minutes.

39:48.500 --> 39:53.440
Cause I play quarters and dollars.

39:53.440 --> 39:55.420
I don't stick around for that nickel stuff.

39:55.420 --> 39:56.420
That ain't gambling.

39:56.420 --> 39:57.420
That's just...

39:57.420 --> 39:59.420
That's how you don't lose $75.

39:59.420 --> 40:03.980
Cause a buck gets you twenty plays.

40:03.980 --> 40:08.140
Oh, for a nickel, well, see, no, no, no.

40:08.140 --> 40:10.500
Because on nickel machines, this actually, you know what?

40:10.500 --> 40:13.980
can relate this to Bimani because a lot of those nickel machines are built by

40:13.980 --> 40:17.220
Konami. You may not know this but Konami actually has a lot of these machines as

40:17.220 --> 40:21.060
well and the deal with is that a lot of the nickel machines that are out there

40:21.060 --> 40:25.900
are actually video slot machines and the way they're built they have five reels

40:25.900 --> 40:31.380
and when you put that you can play them nine different ways it's like you could

40:31.380 --> 40:35.580
play it straight across you could play it diagonally bouncing around this way

40:35.580 --> 40:40.180
and that way and like making little mountains and valleys it's crazy all the

40:40.180 --> 40:43.900
different line patterns that you can have when you play on a nickel slot

40:43.900 --> 40:48.220
machine so if you want to play all nine ways on the nickel slot you're really

40:48.220 --> 40:56.860
spending 50 cents a pull but that's crap because that stuff is programmed only

40:56.860 --> 41:00.980
spit out so I hate playing nickel slots to be honest there's actually more than

41:00.980 --> 41:04.460
five arrows so it's better than pump up

41:04.460 --> 41:09.460
Did you say you wanted me back for my witty remarks?

41:09.460 --> 41:10.460
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

41:10.460 --> 41:11.460
Man, look what you got yourself into.

41:11.460 --> 41:12.460
I'm starting to reconsider that thought.

41:12.460 --> 41:14.460
What's up with my bass?

41:14.460 --> 41:16.460
And then, what else was there?

41:16.460 --> 41:21.460
There was the buffet yesterday and I was going to talk about something else I can't remember.

41:21.460 --> 41:23.460
I guess I had a pretty good week otherwise.

41:23.460 --> 41:25.460
Pretty mellow.

41:25.460 --> 41:26.460
I didn't do a lot.

41:26.460 --> 41:27.460
I was sick Wednesday.

41:27.460 --> 41:28.460
I didn't go to work.

41:28.460 --> 41:30.460
And so, you know, that's kind of a bummer.

41:30.460 --> 41:34.020
Don't drink on weeknights, kids.

41:34.020 --> 41:37.740
This is something I learned. Don't drink on a weeknight.

41:37.740 --> 41:41.140
Yeah, don't overdrink on a weeknight. Don't do it without a plan.

41:41.140 --> 41:45.060
Don't take seven shots of straight up rum on a weeknight within the scope of an

41:45.060 --> 41:45.500
hour.

41:45.500 --> 41:49.740
You know, that wouldn't stop me.

41:49.740 --> 41:53.340
Don't do that at any time.

41:53.340 --> 41:58.500
Seriously, if I ever do that again, I'm checking myself into AA or something

41:58.500 --> 42:03.260
and I'm not into those 12-step programs. I'm a one-step program kind of person. I'm no

42:03.260 --> 42:09.580
more drinking on weeknights period. Step one, remove cap. Step two, take shot glass. That's

42:09.580 --> 42:19.300
your 12-step program. Pour liquor. Step four, drink. Step five, fuck the other steps. I

42:19.300 --> 42:25.540
have a two-step program, over the tracks, brewery. You live right near him? Yes. For

42:25.540 --> 42:27.540
For those that don't know, you live near a brewery.

42:27.540 --> 42:29.540
I don't even know that I live near a brewery.

42:29.540 --> 42:31.540
How the hell am I going to tell anyone else?

42:31.540 --> 42:35.540
I've got to come out there sometime. It's just weeknight, drive...

42:35.540 --> 42:36.540
Drive with someone.

42:36.540 --> 42:39.540
I know, I will. Someday.

42:39.540 --> 42:41.540
Take the train.

42:41.540 --> 42:42.540
Someday.

42:42.540 --> 42:46.540
I guess that's it for now. If I think there's something else exciting, I'll tell you guys about it later.

42:46.540 --> 42:48.540
But gambling was a highlight of my weekend. What?

42:51.540 --> 42:52.540
No.

42:52.540 --> 42:58.540
I didn't. I was antisocial this weekend. I was very antisocial this weekend.

42:58.540 --> 43:02.540
That's kind of the theme of my whole week, was antisocialness. That's alright.

43:02.540 --> 43:09.540
Alright, you guys are sick of hearing about us, I'm sure. We're going to come back, we're going to take a break, we're going to come back and we're going to talk about some Bomani news going on out there right now.

43:09.540 --> 43:17.540
We've got some news on 2DX Nightstyle going on, and we've got some news on UltraMix 2, kind of, sorta.

43:17.540 --> 43:23.540
Even though the game's already out, we have some more news on Ultramix 2 that's all been developing throughout today, in fact.

43:23.540 --> 43:30.540
No Song Pack 8 yet, and all sorts of other stuff that we can come up with.

43:30.540 --> 43:32.540
Plus, Jamie has something she wants to share with you guys, too.

43:32.540 --> 43:40.540
I'm not really sure how we're going to do this on air, how this is going to translate to radio, but you seem to have something already planned, Jamie, for our listeners.

43:40.540 --> 43:41.540
Webcam.

43:41.540 --> 43:42.540
And it's a follow-up to last week, right?

43:42.540 --> 43:43.540
Yeah, it's a follow-up to last week.

43:43.540 --> 43:48.240
last week. I'm glad you brought up the webcam. www.orangelaungeradio.com and you can see

43:48.240 --> 43:51.820

44:04.420 --> 44:11.420
we get back from this break, announcement. Big, huge Orange Launch Radio announcement

44:11.420 --> 44:15.580
though could change the future of everything as we know it

44:15.580 --> 44:18.840
will be back after this

44:18.840 --> 44:22.300
yes somebody's going to be fired for doing something about alright

44:22.300 --> 44:25.700
uh... more two d x red music in this break starting off with a little bit of

44:25.700 --> 44:32.700
of Akira Yamaoka. Thank you very much. We'll be back.

45:55.700 --> 46:02.700
It's been long since we've been together

46:02.700 --> 46:08.700
Even though we've been together

46:08.700 --> 46:16.700
We've been together since we've been together

48:16.700 --> 48:18.700
Come on

49:46.700 --> 49:47.700
Hey!

49:47.700 --> 49:48.700
Hey!

49:48.700 --> 49:49.700
Hey!

49:49.700 --> 49:50.700
Hey!

50:20.700 --> 50:21.700
Hey!

50:24.700 --> 50:25.700
Hey!

50:55.700 --> 50:59.700
the

50:59.700 --> 51:03.700
the

51:03.700 --> 51:07.700
the

51:07.700 --> 51:11.700
the

51:11.700 --> 51:15.700
the

51:15.700 --> 51:19.700
the

51:19.700 --> 51:23.700
the

52:23.700 --> 52:49.980
We

52:49.980 --> 52:53.100
are back here on Orange Lounge Radio.

52:53.100 --> 52:58.160
you enjoyed that break of some 2DX Red music. Now that the OST is out, you can really take

52:58.160 --> 53:03.980
a second look at a lot of those songs. It really just shows you how much the quality

53:03.980 --> 53:09.900
of an MP3 or quality of a rip can really affect the way you perceive a song. For instance,

53:09.900 --> 53:15.140
what would be a song? Well, I would say EVO66 was one of those songs. We played that one

53:15.140 --> 53:18.740
a little bit earlier in the show. That was one of those songs that I just, when I heard

53:18.740 --> 53:23.300
the soundboard rip, or the one from the game, I was just kind of like, oh, this sounds okay.

53:23.300 --> 53:26.940
But then, like, when I was listening to the soundtrack on, I was like, oh, this is kind

53:26.940 --> 53:30.500
of groovy. Like, it really, you know, it kind of thumps a lot more. I guess because you

53:30.500 --> 53:33.620
get more of the bass and the fullness of the sound. Like, this is a really, like, thumping

53:33.620 --> 53:38.860
song. And considering I live too far away from any 2DX Red machines, so I haven't really

53:38.860 --> 53:43.660
gotten to play the actual machine, this is the only way I kind of get to live 2DX Red.

53:43.660 --> 53:44.660
Where are they around here?

54:13.660 --> 54:42.300
I don't know. Pause it for a minute. Stop for a minute. Okay, because you just played

54:42.300 --> 54:47.280
the Soundtrack 1 side-by-side. Okay, it probably is not going to translate well, though, over

54:47.280 --> 54:50.520
our stream, because our stream is for dial-up radio, so I don't think you're going to get

54:50.520 --> 54:54.940
the same quality there, because you're probably like, that sounds the same to me. Probably

54:54.940 --> 54:59.380
does. But here's the thing, is that, for those of us in studio, we can hear it a little more.

54:59.380 --> 55:03.040
You really can hear a lot more of the stereo effects, I think, and just kind of like the

55:03.040 --> 55:07.240
fullness of the instruments. I don't know, it makes a big difference to me. It's huge.

55:07.240 --> 55:11.640
It's like the difference, it's like when somebody rips an MP3 at 112 and 192.

55:11.640 --> 55:15.040
Sure, it sounds just fine at 112, you can understand everything perfectly,

55:15.040 --> 55:17.240
but at 192 it's like, oh my god.

55:17.240 --> 55:20.240
It sounds just like the CD.

55:20.240 --> 55:22.240
Anyway.

55:22.240 --> 55:25.240
Um, let's see, what else was I gonna bring up here?

55:25.240 --> 55:28.640
Uh, big news for Orange Lounge Radio.

55:28.640 --> 55:34.540
I don't wanna spill too much, however sometime before the end of the month,

55:34.540 --> 55:38.540
We're officially going to be making some big changes to the station.

55:38.540 --> 55:40.540
Big changes.

55:40.540 --> 55:42.540
Yeah, we're firing Loki.

55:44.540 --> 55:47.540
He's just too angry. No, of course we're not firing Loki.

55:47.540 --> 55:49.540
We're cloning Rob.

55:49.540 --> 55:51.540
Something will be leaving the station, however.

55:51.540 --> 55:54.540
Something's leaving. Something's coming.

55:54.540 --> 55:56.540
Instead, it's going to be interesting.

55:56.540 --> 55:58.540
Maybe you're cocky?

55:59.540 --> 56:03.540
I don't want to say too much more, but we're going to freshen up Orange Lounge a little bit.

56:03.540 --> 56:07.560
just said that Orange Lawn is getting too stale. We're gonna freshen things up around

56:07.560 --> 56:11.500
here a little bit. So the... FDS? We don't have an official... Yeah, we're gonna spray

56:11.500 --> 56:23.000
some FDS on our station. Cause it needs it. But we'll announce an official date soon.

56:23.000 --> 56:27.120
So stay tuned to our website, orangelawnjr.com for more details. We can just go ahead and

56:27.120 --> 56:31.720
tell them that we were finally bought out by Sirius Broadcasting and our... Actually

56:31.720 --> 56:37.080
The Comcast bought us, and starting next week we're going to be called G4 Orange Lounge

56:37.080 --> 56:38.080
Radio.

56:38.080 --> 56:39.080
G4 Orange Lounge.

56:39.080 --> 56:44.060
Yeah, yeah, we're G4 Orange Lounge.

56:44.060 --> 56:48.200
And then in three weeks, they'll just be G4 again.

56:48.200 --> 56:52.600
With all the original content removed.

56:52.600 --> 56:58.300
Yeah, except all of us will have been fired and like, you know, maybe the F.U.'s segment

56:58.300 --> 56:59.300
is still intact.

56:59.300 --> 57:00.300
That'll be the one thing they keep.

57:00.300 --> 57:21.300
And all of us will be replaced by busty Asian chicks and American Idol rejects, and that'll be it. We'll be a great radio station to look at.

57:21.300 --> 57:23.300
Dude, what else could we bash about G4?

57:23.300 --> 57:30.300
Dude, you know what? I would be on the Busty Asian Chick show because I can appreciate their talents.

57:30.300 --> 57:32.300
Are you a Busty Asian Chick?

57:32.300 --> 57:39.300
Who knows, guys? I said something new's coming to Orange Lounge Radio this month. Maybe the Busty Asian Chick show. We'll see.

57:39.300 --> 57:44.300
Hey, Loki needs a spin-off show.

57:48.300 --> 57:53.300
You should put an ad in the paper, try to get some busty Asian chicks over here once a week, and just talk.

57:56.300 --> 57:58.300
So, how are they doing today?

58:01.300 --> 58:04.300
Good, good. That's right, bounce a little bit.

58:04.300 --> 58:07.740
hmm yeah

58:07.740 --> 58:10.580
today we're gonna play some DDR

58:10.580 --> 58:13.620
yeah it'll be great radio, Loki, it'll be excellent radio

58:13.620 --> 58:15.060
just so I can point out

58:15.060 --> 58:18.820
I know the folks at home can't see her naked light riding around on the

58:18.820 --> 58:22.440
DDR pad but I can guarantee that she's doing it

58:22.440 --> 58:23.500
yeah

58:23.500 --> 58:26.260
go for that triple A

58:26.260 --> 58:27.660
slower

58:27.660 --> 58:28.260
slower

58:28.260 --> 58:32.980
this is why radio porn never took off

58:32.980 --> 58:37.020
yet yet radio on the fire radio on the phone sex on the phone is still do you

58:37.020 --> 58:38.420
know interactive

58:38.420 --> 58:40.800
by direction

58:40.800 --> 58:42.980
where an interactive program

58:42.980 --> 58:48.700
yes skype sex

58:48.700 --> 58:50.000
program

58:50.000 --> 58:52.860
all right move right along

58:52.860 --> 58:57.740
time out some stuff going on in the money world uh...

58:57.740 --> 58:59.200
i was going to point this out

58:59.200 --> 59:04.200
There's an interesting thread going on over on DDRFreak right now, and it has to do with Ultramix 2.

59:06.200 --> 59:14.200
And, uh, one of the moderators over there, Cutris, noticed that there was a lot of stuff going on with the website.

59:14.200 --> 59:21.200
That there was a pattern to the way all these images, the images, the song images, were put on the site.

59:21.200 --> 59:28.460
So, I'm not sure what inspired him to do it, but he wrote a Perl script that will check

59:28.460 --> 59:33.100
for the existence of every possible song banner, because basically every song banner on the

59:33.100 --> 59:41.840
site is four letters, underscore, T-H. So he wrote this script that will scan everything

59:41.840 --> 59:46.060
on the site and put in all these different combinations of letters. And he noticed that

59:46.060 --> 59:53.500
if you put in CRZY underscore th it actually pulls up a banner and it's not

59:53.500 --> 59:59.280
this is on the Konami of Hawaii site it's actually a banner that says crazy

59:59.280 --> 01:00:06.360
and love by Beyonce and it's got its own cute little artsy pattern so what the

01:00:06.360 --> 01:00:10.840
hell's the song banner doing on Konami of Hawaii site don't know nobody's

01:00:10.840 --> 01:00:14.840
I guess like White and Apple have a PowerBook G5 link.

01:00:40.840 --> 01:00:42.440
Are you guys still on IRC?

01:00:42.440 --> 01:00:43.440
No, there was a big split.

01:00:43.440 --> 01:00:46.840
Oh, I got kicked from chat completely, so I'll try to get back in.

01:00:46.840 --> 01:00:52.840
Could it be that they were songs that were supposed to be there and now they're not there anymore?

01:00:52.840 --> 01:00:55.040
Don't know, but they're on the site.

01:00:55.040 --> 01:00:59.040
That's not the only one, there's more songs.

01:00:59.040 --> 01:01:05.740
Including Boom Boom Dollar, the KOG G3 mix by King Kong D Jungle Girls.

01:01:05.740 --> 01:01:07.840
You know, that was the one in third mix, the speed one.

01:01:07.840 --> 01:01:11.560
Hold On Me. That was the Para Para song that was in DDR Extreme.

01:01:11.560 --> 01:01:14.880
I love that song. And then there's also a song banner that was found

01:01:14.880 --> 01:01:20.620
In My Dreams by Nomi. That's a licensed song you guys. It's not the same In My

01:01:20.620 --> 01:01:22.160
Dreams that was in

01:01:22.160 --> 01:01:25.840
Dance Maniacs but it's actually

01:01:25.840 --> 01:01:30.360
a commercial song and aren't you lucky I have a little clip of it actually

01:01:30.360 --> 01:01:36.800
if I can find it.

01:01:36.800 --> 01:01:39.800
I'm looking right now. I know I had it somewhere.

01:01:39.800 --> 01:01:41.800
Here's a little clip of that song.

01:01:41.800 --> 01:01:43.800
Because some folks even on the thread were asking,

01:01:43.800 --> 01:01:44.800
what in the hell is that song?

01:01:44.800 --> 01:01:46.800
This is it. This is In My Dreams by Nomi.

01:02:14.800 --> 01:02:27.480
So, interesting that Banners exists not just for that song, but for the Crazy in Love Beyonce,

01:02:27.480 --> 01:02:33.400
yet neither one appears to have any connection to Ultra Mix 2.

01:02:33.400 --> 01:02:35.600
How do you think to do something like that?

01:02:35.600 --> 01:02:38.320
I gotta hand it to Cutris.

01:02:38.320 --> 01:02:43.500
I mean sure I've heard of scanning directories to see if there's files in there that aren't

01:02:43.500 --> 01:02:48.400
linked or something like that. But to figure out that, gee, there's a pattern, maybe there's

01:02:48.400 --> 01:02:52.120
songs missing. I guess maybe what he was doing is he was trying to look for the banners for

01:02:52.120 --> 01:02:56.960
Song Pack 8, maybe. I'm thinking maybe that was it, and then stumbled across this instead.

01:02:56.960 --> 01:03:07.240
I don't know, but hats off to him. Crazy. Anyway. So, more to develop on now. I guess

01:03:07.240 --> 01:03:15.400
we will see what happens. Are they going to end up in a song pack? Who knows? Alright.

01:03:15.400 --> 01:03:24.000
Moving on. I also want to talk about something that's going on with BeatMania 2DX Night Style

01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:30.780
Consumer. That's a big thing that's going on right now. This is interesting is that

01:03:30.780 --> 01:03:35.520
Night Style is going to be coming out next month, but there's going to be, get this,

01:03:35.520 --> 01:03:40.380
Seven different ways to buy 2DX for Ninth Style.

01:03:40.380 --> 01:03:45.080
Seven different packages that Konami Style is putting out.

01:03:45.080 --> 01:03:52.700
Ninth Style plus a benefit CD, a Visual Emotions 2 DVD that you can just buy by itself.

01:03:52.700 --> 01:03:57.520
Ninth Style plus the CD plus Visual Emotions 2 plus a poster.

01:03:57.520 --> 01:03:59.320
That's going to run you about a hundred bucks.

01:03:59.320 --> 01:04:03.820
Ninth Style plus a benefit CD plus V-Rare 10 plus poster.

01:04:03.820 --> 01:04:12.820
And then, just all these combinations. There's Visual Emotions 2, Poster, V-Rare 10, and then all these goodies.

01:04:12.820 --> 01:04:17.820
My gosh, there's a gazillion different ways you can buy this. It almost sounds like something Nintendo would do.

01:04:17.820 --> 01:04:26.820
And there's the one at the bottom there, Night Style, Benefit CD, V-Rare 10, member of B4U, and a poster.

01:04:26.820 --> 01:04:29.820
And that's gonna run you about 200.

01:04:29.820 --> 01:04:37.020
Yes, you can actually buy yourself, buy yourself a member of B4U.

01:04:37.020 --> 01:04:38.020
That's lovely.

01:04:38.020 --> 01:04:39.020
Is it torture?

01:04:39.020 --> 01:04:47.940
It sounds like something that, yes, there's a keychain.

01:04:47.940 --> 01:04:52.900
Translation that was posted to the live journal community, BM underscore 2DX, this is very

01:04:52.900 --> 01:04:53.900
nice.

01:04:53.900 --> 01:04:58.620
B-Mania 2DX it seems in order to put out, it is the portable strap which finishes the

01:04:58.620 --> 01:05:02.700
The whole, remember this is English here, with the metal material and the good set which

01:05:02.700 --> 01:05:06.260
designs the various designs of 2DX as the sticker.

01:05:06.260 --> 01:05:09.680
The metal portable strap, the mark of 2DX stamped in the metal plate.

01:05:09.680 --> 01:05:14.880
In addition, the yearning AAA mark of the user is stamped on plate back.

01:05:14.880 --> 01:05:19.320
So in other words, they're going to have this kind of AAA keychain it sounds like.

01:05:19.320 --> 01:05:23.480
Some of the songs that are going to be on Visual Emotions 2, some of the videos that

01:05:23.480 --> 01:05:30.480
going to be on it. Doll, Lucy, Space Fight, Quasar, so a lot of the newer songs. But then

01:05:30.480 --> 01:05:35.600
it kind of goes back to some of the old ones, too. Summer Vacation, 2DX, the song from,

01:05:35.600 --> 01:05:43.240
what, Fifth Style, Burn in the Floor, Leading Cyber. Doesn't this sound like something Nintendo

01:05:43.240 --> 01:05:47.240
would do, repackaging the same thing seven different ways? It's like, you should buy

01:05:47.240 --> 01:05:50.960
seven Game Boy Advances so you can have them all in different colors. Wouldn't that be

01:05:50.960 --> 01:05:57.360
be fabulous? How many iMac colors are there? Yeah, exactly. It's like an iMac. Uh, Jamie,

01:05:57.360 --> 01:06:02.400
you're gonna get nice style, right? I'm debating. Are you gonna go for one of these frilly combinations

01:06:02.400 --> 01:06:06.600
if you do it? I'm debating. Probably just gonna get the game. Maybe it'll be rare. Are

01:06:06.600 --> 01:06:11.660
you gonna do the one where you can buy a member of B4U? No, that's okay. Not unless I get

01:06:11.660 --> 01:06:18.660
to, you know, abuse and, you know, maybe draw on her with a Sharpie or something. Beautiful.

01:06:18.660 --> 01:06:25.660
How about you, Loki? Any interest in this stuff at all? You're not a big 2DX fan, though, huh?

01:06:25.660 --> 01:06:30.660
No, I'm not really a huge fan of 2DX. I don't really even play 2DX, so...

01:06:30.660 --> 01:06:37.660
No, I'm not excited about this at all. The only thing I'd be excited about is, like, V-R 10. Maybe that's about it, though.

01:06:37.660 --> 01:06:43.660
Everything else is just old to me. You know, like, I don't really care about the Visual Emotion CD or whatever that is.

01:06:43.660 --> 01:06:56.660
The benefit CD might be cool, because I think it might be the live performance or whatever they did, you know how they do those invitation only concerts and crap. I think that's probably what it is, the second one of those.

01:06:56.660 --> 01:07:06.660
Yeah, it'd be rare. Just like the audio CDs that are coming with that. And of course, the consumer tracks that will be on 2DX9, so that'll be cool.

01:07:06.660 --> 01:07:16.660
Um, this is interesting, um, this just in, and it goes back to the topic we were talking

01:07:16.660 --> 01:07:22.580
about previously, literally, just in, Elmo posted this in chat, it says, use the letters

01:07:22.580 --> 01:07:27.300
SCAN, and that whole Konami of Hawaii site thing with the hidden banners, if you use

01:07:27.300 --> 01:07:34.060
SCAN, S-C-A-N, as the letters, Mystique, Scandalous, that's the song I've heard of the club a few

01:07:34.060 --> 01:07:38.500
times that's definitely a big license song I know that song so very

01:07:38.500 --> 01:07:44.620
interesting all hidden away on Konami of Hawaii's site for some reason who knows

01:07:44.620 --> 01:07:50.580
and of course Jason in our chat room our resident one of our many internet geeks

01:07:50.580 --> 01:07:56.300
we have to listen to this show is kind of is talking about what you found the

01:07:56.300 --> 01:08:00.220
banner for randomly typing in letters I did AAA and I found a well we all know

01:08:00.220 --> 01:08:03.220
that A's in the game I know but I mean I was just randomly typing in letters yeah

01:08:03.220 --> 01:08:09.740
Yeah, yeah. It works. But he says that if you think about it, every DDR version, you

01:08:09.740 --> 01:08:13.220
remember the master song list? Loki's talked about this on the show before in the past.

01:08:13.220 --> 01:08:16.620
If you haven't listened to the show in a while, you probably never heard this. But basically

01:08:16.620 --> 01:08:22.100
the every DDR song has this four letter code and some kind of master list of songs that's

01:08:22.100 --> 01:08:28.140
out there. And is there a connection between that list and the fact that the way these

01:08:28.140 --> 01:08:34.260
files were named, the songs happened to have a four letter link to them. So, maybe they

01:08:34.260 --> 01:08:44.260
were kind of, who knows, linking that all together. Very interesting. Very, very, very

01:08:44.260 --> 01:08:49.700
interesting. Oh my gosh, look at this. I don't, what are they doing? Somebody must be running

01:08:49.700 --> 01:08:57.180
it right now. El Mollet just said, use the letters P-A-R-T and you get this song. Pink,

01:08:57.180 --> 01:09:02.300
get the party started you guys know pink right yeah yeah wasn't that a pump song

01:09:02.300 --> 01:09:09.940
too yeah there's a pump song weird weird stuff

01:09:10.100 --> 01:09:16.900
you're ready here first for some reason pink Beyonce mystique they're all

01:09:16.900 --> 01:09:20.860
lurking on Konami of Hawaii site is there a big song pack planned for the

01:09:20.860 --> 01:09:30.660
future? Who knows? Who knows? Interesting. Let's see where to go to now. I think we'll

01:09:30.660 --> 01:09:33.760
take a break. And when we come back from this break, we're going to do the cage match. How's

01:09:33.760 --> 01:09:37.260
that sound to you guys? Actually, what we'll do is we'll also open up the Skype line when

01:09:37.260 --> 01:09:40.880
we come back. I bet some of you guys might want to comment on either the situation with

01:09:40.880 --> 01:09:46.840
the song banners or possibly 2DX night style consumer news. I know some of you folks out

01:09:46.840 --> 01:09:49.420
there were really wanting to comment on some of the stuff going on there with that. So

01:09:49.420 --> 01:09:54.780
we will certainly open up the skype line for you guys. We're going to start off this break

01:09:54.780 --> 01:10:01.940
with a little song from 2DX Red called Gigadelic. Gigadelic? Like a gigabyte? Gigadelic. We'll

01:10:01.940 --> 01:10:03.940
We'll be back after this.

01:10:31.940 --> 01:10:32.440
Hey!

01:10:36.240 --> 01:10:36.740
Hey!

01:10:36.740 --> 01:10:37.240
Hey!

01:10:37.240 --> 01:10:37.740
Hey!

01:10:42.740 --> 01:10:43.240
Hey!

01:12:43.240 --> 01:12:46.700
Je me sauvignon d'être un proure

01:12:46.700 --> 01:12:52.100
C'est un sérémer, je m'appelle pas en c'est, c'est

01:12:52.100 --> 01:12:57.460
Je vous pouvez pas quelqu'il fois

01:12:57.460 --> 01:13:03.060
Quelqu'il fois, quelqu'il fois

01:13:03.060 --> 01:13:08.460
Je vous pouvez pas quelqu'il fois

01:14:08.460 --> 01:14:10.460
You

01:14:38.460 --> 01:14:45.460
When the time is coming for the show

01:14:45.460 --> 01:15:05.460
When the time is coming for the show

01:15:05.460 --> 01:15:08.460
The time is coming for the show

01:15:08.460 --> 01:15:11.460
We got so excited

01:15:11.460 --> 01:15:13.460
I remember last time

01:15:13.460 --> 01:15:15.460
When I

01:15:15.460 --> 01:15:17.460
Got crazy

01:15:17.460 --> 01:15:19.460
Looking over the crowd

01:15:19.460 --> 01:15:22.460
I could see them having fun

01:15:22.460 --> 01:15:25.460
When the music and the car

01:15:25.460 --> 01:15:28.460
Met together on the floor

01:15:28.460 --> 01:15:32.460
When they'll take shining cards off your tree

01:15:32.460 --> 01:15:36.460
Show me the way for a loving, amazing

01:15:36.460 --> 01:15:41.460
House and two dogs, what's all this love for you?

01:15:54.460 --> 01:15:57.460
Don't you know the crowd?

01:15:57.460 --> 01:16:00.460
I can see them having fun

01:16:00.460 --> 01:16:06.460
When the music and the cards match together and look up

01:16:06.460 --> 01:16:10.460
Where they'll take shining cards off your plate

01:16:10.460 --> 01:16:13.460
Show me the way for loving

01:16:13.460 --> 01:16:17.460
And making cards until you're

01:16:17.460 --> 01:16:20.460
I promise I'm for you

01:16:47.460 --> 01:16:58.220
We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio, and you should see our chat room, they're going

01:16:58.220 --> 01:17:01.780
crazy trying to come up with all these four-letter combinations now to try and figure out what

01:17:01.780 --> 01:17:06.340
else they can find on the site. Even though, apparently there's a script that's running,

01:17:06.340 --> 01:17:10.420
I think it was running for a while and then it stopped. Cutress made a post about he had

01:17:10.420 --> 01:17:14.300
to stop it, and he's thinking about starting it again. That's not stopping people in our

01:17:14.300 --> 01:17:17.820
chat room from going and trying to figure out all the four-letter combinations. Now

01:17:17.820 --> 01:17:22.320
somebody's trying to dig up a master list so they can go through all the four letters.

01:17:22.320 --> 01:17:26.260
I wouldn't know anything about that. God damn, you people got time on your hands.

01:17:26.260 --> 01:17:32.440
It's beautiful. It's crazy how obsessed people are with DDR. Maybe not necessarily obsessed

01:17:32.440 --> 01:17:37.980
with DDR, but just obsessed. Pointing the finger. Yeah, finding, solving the mystery.

01:17:37.980 --> 01:17:43.740
There's a little bit of a thrill of it, I think. It's kind of neat. Matt? Or Loki? I

01:17:43.740 --> 01:17:52.740
I was going to say that there were a few four-letter codes I think I had posted on our site a long-ass time ago, but if you look in the news archives, you probably could find it.

01:17:52.740 --> 01:17:55.740
So, anyways.

01:17:55.740 --> 01:17:58.740
Very interesting.

01:17:58.740 --> 01:18:02.740
Yeah, I think if you do a news archive search, there is a master list somewhere.

01:18:02.740 --> 01:18:03.740
Huh.

01:18:03.740 --> 01:18:06.740
They were numeric.

01:18:06.740 --> 01:18:08.740
Yeah. Hmm.

01:18:08.740 --> 01:18:09.740
And they didn't work.

01:18:09.740 --> 01:18:10.740
And what, the...

01:18:10.740 --> 01:18:12.740
The numeric codes don't work.

01:18:12.740 --> 01:18:20.120
oh they don't interesting I tried about six or seven of them well they're gonna

01:18:20.120 --> 01:18:25.580
there some folks are are going in the crazy and trying to find something out

01:18:25.580 --> 01:18:31.080
good luck you guys and if you find out more tell us so we can spoil the news on

01:18:31.080 --> 01:18:35.720
air for everybody what news it is we don't know just you know hey this song

01:18:35.720 --> 01:18:40.000
banner sitting here in a directory not being used for anything probably don't

01:18:40.000 --> 01:18:44.760
mean shit, but boy, isn't it funny what Konami keeps on their site? I wonder what other kind

01:18:44.760 --> 01:18:48.760
of goodies Konami has on their site. Maybe they've got like top secret documents and

01:18:48.760 --> 01:18:53.720
stuff all hidden on their website, who knows. Anyway, we're going to open up the Skype line

01:18:53.720 --> 01:18:58.320
for those of you guys who want to give us a call. Just go to www.orangelandradio.com,

01:18:58.320 --> 01:19:02.920
click on interact with us, and you can read all about how you, yes you the listener, can

01:19:02.920 --> 01:19:08.760
call us. We're ghetto, you see, and we can't afford an 800 number really, so we have you

01:19:08.760 --> 01:19:15.040
call us using this fancy little internet program so do that and call us and we'll

01:19:15.040 --> 01:19:19.160
take your call live on air and you can interact with us that way so we'll open

01:19:19.160 --> 01:19:22.680
up the sky believe it usually takes a little bit for folks to call in because

01:19:22.680 --> 01:19:26.680
of the buffer we are getting one call right now though let's go to it hello

01:19:26.680 --> 01:19:34.120
you are on orange lounge radio legend of Zaku hello legend of Zaku how are you

01:19:34.120 --> 01:19:41.120
Let me see, he's trying to figure out any other banners that I can actually guess from the site.

01:19:41.120 --> 01:19:47.120
It's just not a Skype line segment if Zaku doesn't hammer the lines and get in first, man. It's crazy.

01:19:47.120 --> 01:19:50.120
It's just luck, man. I just managed to hit it first.

01:19:50.120 --> 01:19:54.120
Apparently, yeah. Now there's a bunch of people trying to get in right now, but you got in there first. Lucky you.

01:19:54.120 --> 01:20:02.120
Why, is my question, why are you hammering the site trying to find all these different letter combinations?

01:20:02.120 --> 01:20:07.120
Think about it. I mean, if you find it, then you'll probably be the first one to know.

01:20:07.120 --> 01:20:11.120
You know, and then you'll be tempted to just, you know, spread the news.

01:20:11.120 --> 01:20:17.120
And then, you know, if it gets to that point where Konami finds out what we're actually doing, then it might be a problem.

01:20:17.120 --> 01:20:20.120
Because we know too much.

01:20:20.120 --> 01:20:25.120
What exactly are you finding out? That's the problem. We have no idea what we're finding out.

01:20:25.120 --> 01:20:26.180
finding out

01:20:26.180 --> 01:20:28.420
we've got to find out banners

01:20:28.420 --> 01:20:31.420
i mean they could be part of you know possibly to find out whatever might be

01:20:31.420 --> 01:20:35.340
on the next uh... the next song packs it could also just be something fucking

01:20:35.340 --> 01:20:38.620
with us it could be somebody fucking with us that could be it completely

01:20:38.620 --> 01:20:41.320
somebody's just fucking with ya could be true

01:20:41.320 --> 01:20:43.100
i you know cutriss is a i mean

01:20:43.100 --> 01:20:44.420
but great guys

01:20:44.420 --> 01:20:48.540
but he's a mod on ddr freak what a perfect person to be in cahoots with

01:20:48.540 --> 01:20:50.620
konami right yes

01:20:50.620 --> 01:20:52.820
although i doubt it the only one who could

01:20:52.820 --> 01:20:56.820
After last year's April Fool's joke, though, I wouldn't put it past anybody.

01:20:56.820 --> 01:20:59.820
You know what? I'm not going to say anything.

01:20:59.820 --> 01:21:02.820
The way Konami has involvement in this, you know, this thing.

01:21:02.820 --> 01:21:06.820
So, the only thing I'm saying is, I mean, it's real simple.

01:21:06.820 --> 01:21:10.820
We already know that some of the good licenses we've managed to figure out,

01:21:10.820 --> 01:21:17.820
and I'm surprised at how far Konami is going, and we don't even know to what extent they are going to.

01:21:17.820 --> 01:21:19.820
Yeah, you're right. We don't know.

01:21:19.820 --> 01:21:25.820
Oh, the access for, you know, who's trying to, or what files are trying to be loaded and all that stuff?

01:21:25.820 --> 01:21:33.820
I mean, no, the fact that we managed to uncover certain licenses that, you know, we thought, you know, Konami would never, you know, imagine getting.

01:21:33.820 --> 01:21:40.820
Well, as far as I know, though, the webmaster of the Konami site there reads the DDR Freak thread.

01:21:40.820 --> 01:21:45.820
She's going to wake up Monday morning and see this and meow.

01:21:45.820 --> 01:21:46.820
Rename the files?

01:21:46.820 --> 01:21:51.660
probably the files are going to be gone at some point tomorrow, but what cat? The question

01:21:51.660 --> 01:21:57.500
is, if the files are deleted, then we know we found something we weren't supposed to

01:21:57.500 --> 01:22:04.380
find. But what? What cat and what bag was just let out? We don't know.

01:22:04.380 --> 01:22:08.820
I don't think they have anything on us. They have nothing on us. We just managed to find

01:22:08.820 --> 01:22:10.160
it because of dumb luck.

01:22:10.160 --> 01:22:17.060
Either way, either way, even if these songs, even if this whole thing was just set up to

01:22:17.060 --> 01:22:25.920
fuck with us and these songs never see the light of day, you bet, you bet, yeah seriously,

01:22:25.920 --> 01:22:31.820
you bet some jerk over on one of the sim files sites, just kidding, love you guys, there'll

01:22:31.820 --> 01:22:36.500
be sim files made out of these songs strictly so that somebody can use these banners.

01:22:36.500 --> 01:22:49.500
That's true. I don't know. It depends. I mean, it could go either way. We're just basically taking stabs in the dark right now and we're hitting something.

01:22:49.500 --> 01:22:52.500
I think that's a nice way to sum it up.

01:22:52.500 --> 01:22:59.500
I mean, Konami... I can only thank Konami for basically trying at least to get some decent licenses

01:22:59.500 --> 01:23:01.500
compared to the ones that they did for Europe.

01:23:02.500 --> 01:23:03.500
Beyonce?

01:23:03.500 --> 01:23:05.500
You know, from what I've seen.

01:23:05.500 --> 01:23:07.500
Beyonce? That's huge!

01:23:07.500 --> 01:23:10.500
That is huge! Crazy in Love by Beyonce.

01:23:10.500 --> 01:23:11.500
That is huge!

01:23:11.500 --> 01:23:14.500
If that is going to be in one of the downloadable song packs...

01:23:14.500 --> 01:23:16.500
I'll just wait for the steps.

01:23:16.500 --> 01:23:21.500
If that is going to be in one of the downloadable song packs, that is freaking huge.

01:23:21.500 --> 01:23:25.580
The first question people are going to ask probably will be, why the hell wasn't this

01:23:25.580 --> 01:23:26.940
in the game to start with?

01:23:26.940 --> 01:23:28.600
But we don't know.

01:23:28.600 --> 01:23:29.860
We don't know any of this.

01:23:29.860 --> 01:23:30.940
Will our questions ever be answered?

01:23:30.940 --> 01:23:31.940
Probably not.

01:23:31.940 --> 01:23:33.700
Well, yeah, that's another good question.

01:23:33.700 --> 01:23:36.980
But I'll just, but I'll judge that song once I see the steps.

01:23:36.980 --> 01:23:38.540
Well, yeah, it always comes down to that.

01:23:38.540 --> 01:23:42.060
Because if they're like eight, like most of the new songs, like eight to nine, like most

01:23:42.060 --> 01:23:47.140
of the new songs are, then, you know, then I'll make my, I'll make my decision.

01:23:47.140 --> 01:23:48.140
Alright.

01:23:48.140 --> 01:23:50.340
Until then, we can only just speculate.

01:23:50.340 --> 01:23:51.340
Sounds good.

01:23:51.340 --> 01:23:54.520
with us, Saku. That's about it. Alright, I got other people trying to get in, so I'm

01:23:54.520 --> 01:24:05.520
going to have to let you go. Um... bye. Alright. Bye, Saku. Have a good one. Later. You know,

01:24:05.520 --> 01:24:08.780
somebody in the chat room just pointed out something very interesting. The chat room

01:24:08.780 --> 01:24:14.520
just died. I know what you're doing. You're all trying to hammer that site right now.

01:24:14.520 --> 01:24:19.080
Okay, maybe not. Maybe some of you guys had to go watch the last part of the stupid bowl

01:24:19.080 --> 01:24:24.840
and see that what the Patriots won. Who are the Patriots? Who are they? I... Is it what?

01:24:24.840 --> 01:24:29.160
New England. Oh, New England. Some team. Like the whole... Yeah. The whole part of that

01:24:29.160 --> 01:24:34.640
nation? The New England? All of it? They've won it for the past couple of years. Oh, I'm

01:24:34.640 --> 01:24:37.680
totally not even paying attention to the Skype line. There's another call coming in. Let's

01:24:37.680 --> 01:24:45.800
go to it. Hi, you're on Orange Lawns Radio. Hello, you are on Orange Lawns Radio. You're

01:24:45.800 --> 01:24:47.800
You're soon to not be on Orange Lawn's Radio.

01:25:15.800 --> 01:25:22.300
If you're going to call the show, before you call us, add this username to your Skype list, give them a call.

01:25:22.300 --> 01:25:26.800
Echo123. It's Echo123.

01:25:26.800 --> 01:25:31.300
And when you call that, you can hear yourself. It's like, literally an echo.

01:25:31.300 --> 01:25:36.300
So you can tell if your Skype line's working or not. So, really good tip for you guys. So, give that a try.

01:25:36.300 --> 01:25:37.800
Anyway, what's on your mind, Ziggy?

01:25:37.800 --> 01:25:40.300
Well, it's about night style.

01:25:40.300 --> 01:25:43.300
Ah, yes, night style. What's up with night style?

01:25:43.300 --> 01:25:48.300
Yeah, I was, yeah, yeah, this benefit CD, which is really obvious.

01:25:48.300 --> 01:25:51.300
What is this benefit CD? What is this?

01:25:51.300 --> 01:25:56.300
I think it has something to do with, you know, with, uh, for every benefit CD that you buy, it will go to charity.

01:25:56.300 --> 01:25:59.300
Isn't it for the tsunami victims?

01:25:59.300 --> 01:26:01.300
I was gonna say, I was gonna say, that's all I've heard.

01:26:01.300 --> 01:26:07.300
Every time I hear the word benefit lately, I know it's some type of tsunami benefit thing.

01:26:07.300 --> 01:26:12.300
Don't get me wrong, great idea, great concept, lot of people there need help.

01:26:12.300 --> 01:26:18.260
But you know, there's other good organizations out there to donate to too. That's all I want to say. Yeah, so

01:26:19.100 --> 01:26:21.100
So have you seen the uh?

01:26:21.180 --> 01:26:26.720
Cover art for a night style. I did see the cover art for night style, but I didn't show it to the other people in studio

01:26:27.340 --> 01:26:33.300
And now I have no idea where the box art went. It's Rob's lousy. I know I'm horrible

01:26:33.300 --> 01:26:36.780
I I will dig it up though the box art. What did you think of the box art?

01:26:36.780 --> 01:26:42.780
Well, it's really fine to me, actually. Everybody at the Money Style has been complaining about it.

01:26:42.780 --> 01:26:50.780
You know what? And when I looked at it, it looked fine to me, too. I don't know what the people are bitching about, really. It's better than some of the other ones, I think.

01:26:50.780 --> 01:26:57.780
They're actually buying what's in the game, not what's on the cover art.

01:26:57.780 --> 01:27:01.360
point here it is for those of you in studio and we'll actually actually I can

01:27:01.360 --> 01:27:06.180
post this as well hahaha in our chat room here is a picture of the night

01:27:06.180 --> 01:27:10.380
style cover what do you guys think of that

01:27:10.380 --> 01:27:19.820
Logan it looks cool that's kind of that's pretty bad I don't see the

01:27:19.820 --> 01:27:24.860
problem with it I mean they've got your mandatory DJ girl on it so you know and

01:27:24.860 --> 01:27:34.420
Eddy. Uh huh. Are those the two new characters in 9th Style? Yeah, they're the 2DX DJs representing

01:27:34.420 --> 01:27:39.320
9th Style. That's what I thought. Yuhua and Eddy. That's what I thought, and it looks

01:27:39.320 --> 01:27:46.060
fine to me. Look at that, it looks like she just got a manicure today. You know, those

01:27:46.060 --> 01:27:51.700
people who've been complaining, they were thinking of the actual poster as the cover

01:27:51.700 --> 01:27:58.700
art for Night Style. Oh, because that was the poster as well? It's supposed to be the

01:27:58.700 --> 01:28:07.060
poster. So Konami got a little lazy, who cares? I'm happy as hell that we're getting Night

01:28:07.060 --> 01:28:11.240
Style in the first place. If they're going to get a little sloppy and make the poster

01:28:11.240 --> 01:28:16.500
the same thing as the cover art, I don't care. It's a fine picture. I would be more much

01:28:16.500 --> 01:28:19.500
I'm much happier if they put reincarnation back on night style.

01:28:20.500 --> 01:28:24.500
Oh, reincarnation. Aren't they supposed to be bringing a bunch of songs back?

01:28:25.500 --> 01:28:31.500
Actually, I already mentioned to you last time that there would be three songs that would mostly come back.

01:28:32.500 --> 01:28:36.500
Right. Well, aren't there songs that have new anothers that need to be accounted for?

01:28:37.500 --> 01:28:40.500
Yeah. Jams, Screams, Minimalion, and Checking You Out.

01:28:41.500 --> 01:28:42.500
Right, right. Okay. That's right.

01:28:42.500 --> 01:28:44.500
Hmm.

01:28:44.500 --> 01:28:46.500
Well, it sounds like it's going to be a good mix either way.

01:28:46.500 --> 01:28:49.500
I can't wait to hear more details. I can't wait to see that full song list.

01:28:49.500 --> 01:28:54.500
And what I really want to see, I want to see if we get any more preview tracks from 10th and 11th.

01:28:54.500 --> 01:28:57.500
And I want to see, and I know it's red, but I'm calling it 11th.

01:28:57.500 --> 01:28:59.500
I want to see if there are, like, good preview songs.

01:28:59.500 --> 01:29:01.500
I want Kachak.

01:29:01.500 --> 01:29:02.500
What?

01:29:02.500 --> 01:29:03.500
I want Kachak.

01:29:03.500 --> 01:29:05.500
Kachak would be cool.

01:29:05.500 --> 01:29:10.500
I personally would love to have the Ryu song, Agiha.

01:29:10.500 --> 01:29:11.500
I want that song.

01:29:11.500 --> 01:29:12.500
I want that song.

01:29:12.500 --> 01:29:13.500
Huh?

01:29:13.500 --> 01:29:14.500
I get hot.

01:29:14.500 --> 01:29:15.500
I get hot.

01:29:15.500 --> 01:29:16.500
Oh, sorry.

01:29:16.500 --> 01:29:17.500
You sound like you're coughing up a hairball.

01:29:17.500 --> 01:29:18.500
I get hot.

01:29:18.500 --> 01:29:19.500
I get hot.

01:29:19.500 --> 01:29:20.500
I get hot.

01:29:20.500 --> 01:29:21.500
I want that song.

01:29:21.500 --> 01:29:25.540
All right, well, you've been listening to this show long enough.

01:29:25.540 --> 01:29:27.500
You know I'm really white when it comes to my pronunciation.

01:29:27.500 --> 01:29:30.820
Yeah, but I'm always here to help you out.

01:29:30.820 --> 01:29:31.820
Well, I appreciate it.

01:29:31.820 --> 01:29:33.620
It's the beauty of the Skype line.

01:29:33.620 --> 01:29:35.740
I can be corrected almost in person.

01:29:35.740 --> 01:29:36.740
It's great.

01:29:36.740 --> 01:29:37.980
You can be corrected in person.

01:29:37.980 --> 01:29:40.940
Yeah, when Jamie isn't here to correct me in person, you are.

01:29:40.940 --> 01:29:41.940
It's just, it's beautiful.

01:29:41.940 --> 01:29:42.940
Yeah.

01:29:42.940 --> 01:29:48.780
And there's another one that you mispronounce it a lot, uh, you know, the artist, uh, Cheer

01:29:48.780 --> 01:29:50.860
Train, who's actually Fujita Blender.

01:29:50.860 --> 01:29:51.860
Fujita?

01:29:51.860 --> 01:29:52.860
Yeah.

01:29:52.860 --> 01:29:53.860
I like Fuzita.

01:29:53.860 --> 01:29:54.860
Oh.

01:29:54.860 --> 01:29:55.860
Alright.

01:29:55.860 --> 01:29:59.700
We're gonna let you go, because we're getting other calls, and I want to let you get back

01:29:59.700 --> 01:30:01.660
to that AOL conversation you're having in the background.

01:30:01.660 --> 01:30:02.660
Alright?

01:30:02.660 --> 01:30:03.660
Alright.

01:30:03.660 --> 01:30:04.660
Have a good one.

01:30:04.660 --> 01:30:05.660
Later.

01:30:05.660 --> 01:30:06.660
Bye.

01:30:06.660 --> 01:30:07.660
We got another call.

01:30:07.660 --> 01:30:09.620
We'll take, we'll take one more call, then maybe we'll go to the cage match after this.

01:30:09.620 --> 01:30:10.620
I don't know.

01:30:10.620 --> 01:30:13.620
What, you don't like talking to people on the Skype line?

01:30:13.620 --> 01:30:15.620
I like talking to people, but I'm ready for the cage match.

01:30:15.620 --> 01:30:17.620
Oh, you want to bring it on?

01:30:17.620 --> 01:30:19.620
Well, I just don't really care.

01:30:19.620 --> 01:30:20.620
Alright, let me get to this person...

01:30:20.620 --> 01:30:22.620
It's already been brought in.

01:30:22.620 --> 01:30:26.620
Let me get to this poor person who's sitting here on the Skype line waiting for us to acknowledge their presence.

01:30:26.620 --> 01:30:28.620
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio!

01:30:28.620 --> 01:30:30.620
Hey, Sky, it's El Mullet again.

01:30:30.620 --> 01:30:32.620
Hello, El Mullet!

01:30:32.620 --> 01:30:36.620
What is going on? You guys are just digging through Konami's site right now.

01:30:36.620 --> 01:30:39.620
You're posting all these crazy banners. What's going on?

01:30:39.620 --> 01:30:43.620
Well, all these crazy banners equal two that I found, but...

01:30:43.620 --> 01:30:46.620
Hey! That's more than I found!

01:30:46.620 --> 01:30:51.620
I just put in two random words, and I pulled out two things.

01:30:51.620 --> 01:30:53.620
I have no idea.

01:30:53.620 --> 01:30:57.620
So you're trying to think of, like, four-letter words that might come up with something.

01:30:57.620 --> 01:31:00.620
Yeah, something like that, and then I'm bored.

01:31:00.620 --> 01:31:04.620
Wow, and you found two. What do you think this all is? What do you think this all adds up to?

01:31:04.620 --> 01:31:19.620
I wouldn't read too much into it personally. I mean, I'm sure that there's some sort of explanation why we've managed to pull up five licensed songs. I'm thinking maybe, you know, they were there, but now they're not there, you know.

01:31:19.620 --> 01:31:24.620
Five songs? Five songs in a song pack? Loki, Loki's tapping my leg for something.

01:31:24.620 --> 01:31:35.620
It might be noticed, or I might mention that not only by putting in who those directories are, you're pulling up stuff from UltraMix 2 but UltraMix 1.

01:31:35.620 --> 01:31:38.620
So I could theorize it could be also UltraMix 3.

01:31:38.620 --> 01:31:43.620
Ah, now that's a good thought there. Maybe these are possible UltraMix 3 songs.

01:31:43.620 --> 01:31:44.620
Or UltraMix 7.

01:31:44.620 --> 01:31:49.620
That's enough of Song Pack 5 by doing the same thing, so that's UltraMix 1.

01:31:49.620 --> 01:31:59.620
Interesting. Because we all know Ultramix 3 has to happen at this point. It has to. Has to happen. And if it doesn't happen, there will be burnination going on.

01:31:59.620 --> 01:32:10.620
I mean, I'm going to amount all this banner finding. Remember when a picture was leaked that had the take it to the morning light banner from DDR Max and it had an SP4 icon on it?

01:32:10.620 --> 01:32:13.620
I remember that. I remember that. And it didn't mean shit.

01:32:13.620 --> 01:32:18.620
Yeah, it didn't mean shit. What we could be pulling up right now could very well not be meaning shit at all.

01:32:18.620 --> 01:32:25.060
all. They're pretty banners. That Crazy in Love banner is kind of cute. That's not the

01:32:25.060 --> 01:32:30.100
kind of banner I would have put for that song. I would have just put a big booty as the banner

01:32:30.100 --> 01:32:35.100
for Crazy in Love, because every time that song comes on, I just think of booty dancing.

01:32:35.100 --> 01:32:38.860
But yet the Crazy in Love banner... I don't want to hear that song now. No, no you don't.

01:32:38.860 --> 01:32:43.260
I don't think I have it. Believe it or not, I don't think I have it on my drive. You think

01:32:43.260 --> 01:32:47.420
that would be a song? I need that song. I need to play it Tuesday. I have plenty of

01:32:47.420 --> 01:33:06.420
I've been looking for crazy right now in love, I've been looking for crazy right now, I've

01:33:06.420 --> 01:33:13.420
play a little clip here. Here it is, here it is. Come on, don't you want to shake your

01:33:18.820 --> 01:33:25.820
booty? This is the part I like. Yeah, that would be, oh I'm sorry, I totally cut it off

01:33:25.820 --> 01:33:29.820
Looking so crazy in the hood, got me looking, got me looking so crazy in the hood

01:33:55.820 --> 01:34:02.060
also pulled like two Konami original banners we pulled the Cutris pulled off

01:34:02.060 --> 01:34:08.380
GMD and hold on me that's right so who knows where that's going on so that's

01:34:08.380 --> 01:34:14.060
seven songs so it's not a true song pack that's true that's true so there's more

01:34:14.060 --> 01:34:21.140
than five so who knows what's going on I'm sure an explanation will be offered

01:34:21.140 --> 01:34:26.980
you know, eventually, like how Song Pack 8 is going to be released eventually.

01:34:26.980 --> 01:34:32.380
Don't get me started on that, I'm so mad at Microsoft for that.

01:34:32.380 --> 01:34:39.700
One of the licensed songs for Ultramix One, Shiny Disco Balls was one, and Do That Fang,

01:34:39.700 --> 01:34:41.700
Castles in the Sky.

01:34:41.700 --> 01:34:42.700
Okay.

01:34:42.700 --> 01:34:47.340
Loki's trying to pull up all these banners from Ultramix One over there, I think, or

01:34:47.340 --> 01:34:48.340
something.

01:34:48.340 --> 01:34:49.340
I don't know what he's doing.

01:34:49.340 --> 01:34:55.840
You know that if trying to find something secret that you're not supposed to see on some website is involved,

01:34:55.840 --> 01:34:56.840
Loki's in on it.

01:34:57.840 --> 01:34:59.840
Anything else you want to share with us, Emelot?

01:35:00.340 --> 01:35:03.840
That's pretty much it. This is the big topic of conversation right now, after all.

01:35:03.840 --> 01:35:04.840
You know what?

01:35:05.840 --> 01:35:13.340
Unfortunately, the way things work in the Bemani scene is it seems like now we're getting in this rhythm of getting all our games at the end of the year in the Christmas season,

01:35:13.340 --> 01:35:17.660
which makes everything post Christmas to E3

01:35:17.660 --> 01:35:21.300
a real dead period. But

01:35:21.300 --> 01:35:24.940
that's why we talk about other stuff too. What can we say? Exactly.

01:35:24.940 --> 01:35:29.060
Alright. Hey, plug your site. Insightpulse.com

01:35:29.060 --> 01:35:32.580

01:39:58.140 --> 01:40:04.100
First up, my pick! Yay, me! Um, I'm gonna pick a band that, this has won the cage match

01:40:04.100 --> 01:40:09.180
a couple times. It's a real popular band amongst, I think, the folks that play DDR, although

01:40:09.180 --> 01:40:16.260
it's not a DDR band. Yeah. But, um, one of our listeners, Allusion, was kind enough to

01:40:16.260 --> 01:40:20.780
send me a bunch of songs by this artist throughout the past week, including some songs off their

01:40:20.780 --> 01:40:25.060
I think it was out last year and I'm just loving it. I'm loving it

01:40:25.060 --> 01:40:31.120
So I got to play it for you guys right now. It's a little band out of Boston called freeze pop and

01:40:31.740 --> 01:40:33.740
This is a song called

01:40:34.140 --> 01:40:36.180
This is a song called stake out

01:40:36.180 --> 01:40:38.180
Enjoy!

01:41:06.180 --> 01:41:07.180
Can't spy

I want to see you more

01:41:32.180 --> 01:41:35.180
Enjoy your bed inside my head

Can't let you see me

01:41:44.180 --> 01:41:46.180
I wanna shake out

01:41:47.180 --> 01:41:49.180
I wanna shake out

01:41:50.180 --> 01:41:52.180

Watching you from far away You look so sweet and clueless

01:42:19.740 --> 01:42:22.740
Soon I'll move in on my prey. It's time for me to do this.

01:42:35.740 --> 01:42:38.740
Watching and waiting.

01:42:38.740 --> 01:42:42.740
The feeling is elating.

01:42:42.740 --> 01:42:45.740

Can't let you see me

01:43:03.740 --> 01:43:06.940
I'm on the stakeout

01:43:07.140 --> 01:43:10.060
I'm on the stakeout

01:43:10.200 --> 01:43:12.580
I'm on a stakeout

01:43:42.580 --> 01:43:44.580

I'm gonna shake out, shake out

01:43:53.580 --> 01:43:55.580
Now I know that you're in my mind

01:44:00.580 --> 01:44:05.580
Alright, first challenger tonight, song number two, Freeze Pop Stake Out

01:44:06.580 --> 01:44:09.580
Did that song stick out in your mind, or would you like to take it out to the trash?

01:44:09.580 --> 01:44:18.580
I like freeze pop because that song just didn't do it for me. Still, it was a good song, so they gave it a 7.

01:44:31.580 --> 01:44:33.580
I like freeze pop, I give it a 9.

01:44:33.580 --> 01:44:35.580
Okay, good. Angel!

01:44:35.580 --> 01:44:37.580
I love Breezepop.

01:44:37.580 --> 01:44:44.580
And, uh, the only time I knew that- knew them, rather, is from, obviously, Amplitude and, uh, frequency.

01:44:44.580 --> 01:44:51.580
So, that sort of did it all for me, and that song is really happy and stuff, so I'll give it a nine.

01:44:51.580 --> 01:44:54.580
A nine from Angel. Loki!

01:44:54.580 --> 01:44:57.580
I absolutely hate Breezepop. I hate-

01:44:57.580 --> 01:44:58.580
We hate you!

01:44:58.580 --> 01:45:03.380
I don't give a shit. You know what? I hate that fucking song. It's awful. It's a one

01:45:03.900 --> 01:45:08.920
Awful, I'm sorry talking over synthesizers is not fucking music awful

01:45:12.660 --> 01:45:17.820
Yes, whereas whereas the song that is oversynth to all hell says girls

01:45:20.100 --> 01:45:22.100
Is music

01:45:22.380 --> 01:45:25.940
Did I never I never said it was good when I put it in okay

01:45:25.940 --> 01:45:36.940
Okay, last time I checked, you're supposed to like the songs, at least somewhat, that you are going to put in the cagement. Call me crazy. Maybe I missed that memo.

01:45:36.940 --> 01:45:38.940
Maybe, maybe.

01:45:38.940 --> 01:45:50.940
Anyway, my thoughts on Freeze Pop. I feel completely opposite from Loki. I think the minimalist synth sound that they have, I think that is what makes them so cool.

01:45:50.940 --> 01:45:55.300
love her voice because she has this very I don't care what you all think type

01:45:55.300 --> 01:46:00.180
thing in your voice I just I love her voice and the pop culture references are

01:46:00.180 --> 01:46:04.100
awesome but they're not cheesy like I've heard bands with cheesy pop culture

01:46:04.100 --> 01:46:09.980
references it's bad they're good yeah yeah so I would give them like I would

01:46:09.980 --> 01:46:13.660
give it like seriously like an eight and a half maybe a nine eight three quarters

01:46:13.660 --> 01:46:16.980
let's give it an eight and three quarters I like it a lot all right let's

01:46:16.980 --> 01:46:20.980
Let's get to song number three, which is Loki's Pick. What did he pick?

01:46:20.980 --> 01:46:23.980
It doesn't matter, it sucks.

01:46:23.980 --> 01:46:26.980
Thank you. Thank you.

01:46:26.980 --> 01:46:29.980
No, um, what I picked was...

01:46:29.980 --> 01:46:36.980
It was actually a song I had heard a while ago and I had downloaded just for the hell of it, because I like the song.

01:46:36.980 --> 01:46:38.980
It's another freeze pop song, isn't it?

01:46:38.980 --> 01:46:41.980
No, it's not a freeze pop song. Thank God.

01:46:41.980 --> 01:46:43.980
Thank God for that.

01:46:43.980 --> 01:46:48.140
No, this is The Killers with Somebody Told Me.

01:46:48.140 --> 01:46:50.340
And it would be like perfect for like Guitar Freaks.

01:46:50.340 --> 01:46:51.340
Cool.

01:46:51.340 --> 01:46:55.280
Alright, Loki says this is his Guitar Freaks song that he would like to see.

01:46:55.280 --> 01:46:57.740
The Killers, Somebody Told Me, song number three.

01:46:57.740 --> 01:46:58.240
Enjoy

01:47:27.740 --> 01:47:37.740
I'm breaking my back just to know your name But having eight clothes in a place like this

01:47:37.740 --> 01:47:47.740
Anything goes but don't blink you might miss Cause having eight clothes in a place like this

01:47:47.740 --> 01:47:56.740
I said I'm having eight clothes in a place like this Bring it back down, bring it back down tonight

01:47:56.740 --> 01:47:58.740
Oh, oh, oh, oh

01:47:58.740 --> 01:48:04.740
Never thought I'd let a rumor ruin my moonlight

01:48:04.740 --> 01:48:08.740
Somebody told me you had a golden breast

01:48:08.740 --> 01:48:10.740
Looked like a girlfriend

01:48:10.740 --> 01:48:13.740
And I had it better be the pair of real-time shears

01:48:13.740 --> 01:48:15.740
And I'm off the next show

01:48:15.740 --> 01:48:17.740
And I'm off the next show

01:48:17.740 --> 01:48:18.740
And I'm off the next show

01:48:18.740 --> 01:48:20.740
Oh, whoopee, whoopee

01:48:20.740 --> 01:48:23.740
Ready, let's roll on to something new

01:48:23.740 --> 01:48:28.740
Take it in so that I'm leaving without you

01:48:30.740 --> 01:48:33.740
I'm ready, let's roll on to something new

01:48:33.740 --> 01:48:37.740
But heaven ain't close to no place like this

01:48:37.740 --> 01:48:43.740
Anything goes to some place you might live

01:48:44.740 --> 01:48:47.740
Cause heaven ain't close to no place like this

01:48:47.740 --> 01:48:51.740
I said heaven ain't close to no place like this

01:48:51.740 --> 01:48:56.740
Bring it back down, bring it back down tonight

01:48:58.740 --> 01:49:04.740
Never thought I'd ever ruin my moonlight

01:49:04.740 --> 01:49:08.740
Somebody told me you had a boyfriend

01:49:08.740 --> 01:49:10.740
Who looked like his girlfriend

01:49:10.740 --> 01:49:12.740
And I hadn't met him yet

01:49:12.740 --> 01:49:15.740
Respect him, it's uncomfortable

01:49:15.740 --> 01:49:19.740
I've got potential for rushing, rushing around

01:49:19.740 --> 01:49:25.740
Taste yourself of me

01:49:25.740 --> 01:49:32.740
I said baby, baby, please

01:49:32.740 --> 01:49:38.740
But I just don't know now

01:49:40.740 --> 01:49:45.740
We are one and we are trying

01:49:45.740 --> 01:49:47.740
Somebody told me

01:50:17.740 --> 01:50:21.240
Who doesn't have to grow fast, they don't have to crack you

01:50:21.240 --> 01:50:24.740
But every time she gets you, it's not confidential

01:50:24.740 --> 01:50:29.740
And I'm not present, I'm rushing, rushing around

01:50:54.740 --> 01:50:59.740
I know, since I don't listen to the radio, this is pretty new to me, so I like it a lot.

01:51:00.740 --> 01:51:02.740
Negative 7, I've been hearing it all week.

01:51:03.740 --> 01:51:07.740
Yeah, I know. Negative 7, I've been hearing it all week.

01:51:10.740 --> 01:51:12.740
It's pretty good. What are you rocking?

01:51:12.740 --> 01:51:21.500
This, boys and girls, let this be a lesson to you. If you're thinking right now that

01:51:21.500 --> 01:51:26.540
this song is overplayed, it's time for you to turn off the radio, seriously, and start

01:51:26.540 --> 01:51:30.880
listening to internet radio and other forms of entertainment that's out there, because

01:51:30.880 --> 01:51:35.540
I have heard that song on the radio the few times I forgot to bring my iPod in the car

01:51:35.540 --> 01:51:38.980
so I could listen to podcasts. I did turn on the radio and I have heard that song so

01:51:38.980 --> 01:51:41.940
I know it's a little mainstream, but I'm not sick of it

01:51:41.940 --> 01:51:48.940
It still feels fresh to me because I haven't allowed corporate horde radio to ruin that song for me yet. Therefore that song I

01:51:49.460 --> 01:51:51.180
Still kind of dig it

01:51:51.180 --> 01:51:53.740
It's a little weird for this cage match

01:51:53.740 --> 01:51:56.780
But I still like the song and don't want to give it a low score

01:51:56.780 --> 01:51:58.780
So I have to give it like a seven and a half

01:51:58.900 --> 01:52:00.100
Loki

01:52:00.100 --> 01:52:02.100
It gets a ten. I was

01:52:02.660 --> 01:52:07.620
No torn between this one or another song put in so I figured I'll try this one and if it doesn't work

01:52:07.620 --> 01:52:12.940
I'll try the next one next week all right fair enough that's it three songs

01:52:12.940 --> 01:52:17.900
your turn your your turn your time to vote here we go the three songs you can

01:52:17.900 --> 01:52:22.700
vote for tonight song number one dream night of fire

01:52:22.700 --> 01:52:41.540
And song number two, Freeze Pop Stakeout.

01:52:41.540 --> 01:52:45.740
And song number three that you can vote for tonight, The Killers, Somebody Told Me

01:52:45.740 --> 01:53:05.200
Alright, place vote now. Send a private message to Skye in the chat room with your vote and

01:53:05.200 --> 01:53:10.040
we'll add it all up and let you guys know who the winner is. Song number one, song number

01:53:10.040 --> 01:53:15.640
two or song number three. Meanwhile, Orange Lounge Radio moves right along, and I gotta

01:53:15.640 --> 01:53:21.760
ask Loki a question I ask Loki every week. What the hell's going on in the sim scene

01:53:21.760 --> 01:53:29.640
now? Anything? Um, I don't think so, really. Other than just people, you know, being afraid

01:53:29.640 --> 01:53:37.360
about, you know, DRA coming after them for downloading sim files and that type of thing.

01:53:37.360 --> 01:53:46.200
All the websites are down, DDRManiaX and DDRUK, two of the big three that are out there are

01:53:46.200 --> 01:53:47.200
down.

01:53:47.200 --> 01:53:52.680
And last week I mentioned, you know, there's a bunch of different sort of food mix type

01:53:52.680 --> 01:54:00.080
packs you can download or check out, and once again those are on the forums for Bill Monning's

01:54:00.080 --> 01:54:02.000
style, you can find those.

01:54:02.000 --> 01:54:07.240
Really nothing's been going on, I think everyone's been just gearing up for Super Bowl or something

01:54:07.240 --> 01:54:11.720
like that because really there's nothing out there. I'm sure you'll see some more coming

01:54:11.720 --> 01:54:18.000
out though for the 2DX Red stuff that's come out because obviously now that the OST rips

01:54:18.000 --> 01:54:23.320
aren't out there you can, you know, bet that there's going to be some of those sim files

01:54:23.320 --> 01:54:31.760
coming out. But besides that, really nothing else going on. It's been just quiet and dead

01:54:31.760 --> 01:54:40.880
like all the websites. So, that's up. That's everything. Kind of sucks.

01:54:40.880 --> 01:54:45.200
You know, is it just that the sim file authors are using the Super Bowl as an excuse to have

01:54:45.200 --> 01:54:52.080
more time to look at Asian prawn on the internet? I don't know why you'd want to look at Asian

01:54:52.080 --> 01:54:56.920
porn, since Asian porn censored, but sure. I guess.

01:54:56.920 --> 01:55:01.360
Well, we can't see Loki's screen for- Let me rephrase. Porn with big-tittied Asian

01:55:01.360 --> 01:55:08.040
girls. Okay, that's completely acceptable then. Can't, I can't tell you how disappointed

01:55:08.040 --> 01:55:11.960
I was when I bought actually like a bunch of VCDs of Asian porn and it was all fucking

01:55:11.960 --> 01:55:16.240
censored. I was like, what the hell is this? This is retarded. This is the dumbest thing.

01:55:16.240 --> 01:55:22.880
Oh my God, those pixels look so hot. You know, mosaics are not sexy. What was the one that

01:55:22.880 --> 01:55:29.680
I got from Dark Sound? The one that Final Fuck X was actually the, that was the first,

01:55:29.680 --> 01:55:35.620
is actually Final Fuck 10, really, was actually the first Asian full-on, like, porn from Asia

01:55:35.620 --> 01:55:38.980
I'd actually seen. It was cosplay porn. Yes, it was cosplay porn with characters from Final

01:55:38.980 --> 01:55:43.180
Fantasy. Didn't we actually do this on the show? I want to say we actually played this

01:55:43.180 --> 01:55:47.220
on the show on an earlier episode. We didn't? No, maybe way back in the day. We did it as

01:55:47.220 --> 01:55:51.860
part of an afterbirth. We did the Dance Dance porn, though. I remember... Yeah, that was

01:55:51.860 --> 01:55:55.780
the one. Loki gave his review of the Dance Dance porn, or what was it called? You remember

01:55:55.780 --> 01:56:00.700
dance fuck or something something like that I have it buried under here on my

01:56:00.700 --> 01:56:05.460
desk somewhere because I remember after I like I bought it or whatever I watched

01:56:05.460 --> 01:56:10.140
it once ago this is interesting and then just kind of tossed it and you know it

01:56:10.140 --> 01:56:17.140
became part of the mass collection of stuff on my desk I what I this was way

01:56:17.140 --> 01:56:21.340
back like episode 30 or 40 like in that area this is like two years ago I think

01:56:21.340 --> 01:56:25.220
we're looking at what the hell was this all about I remember there was it was

01:56:25.220 --> 01:56:30.320
the Dance Dance Fuck movie, and you know, Loki bought it off eBay, because, you know,

01:56:30.320 --> 01:56:35.260
haha, maybe it's connected to Dance Dance Revolution somehow, had nothing to do with

01:56:35.260 --> 01:56:40.640
anything. For those that are unfamiliar out there, and I will show, this is more for the

01:56:40.640 --> 01:56:50.640
in-studio folks, um, there is DDR porn out there. Sadly enough, there is porn that, no,

01:56:50.640 --> 01:56:57.540
porn that's out there and if you if you go here to the but myself image porns

01:56:57.540 --> 01:57:03.440
and we go to the not work safe category here we can see that there are some

01:57:03.440 --> 01:57:16.980
actual you know those you people posting on this board what the hell is wrong

01:57:16.980 --> 01:57:23.980
What's wrong with you? You're drawing pornography to- ugh!

01:57:24.980 --> 01:57:26.980
It's just 4chan, get over it.

01:57:32.980 --> 01:57:34.980
Head hurts.

01:57:34.980 --> 01:57:36.980
Head hurts.

01:57:36.980 --> 01:57:38.980
Jamie, surely you have something to add on this.

01:57:38.980 --> 01:57:40.980
I thought yaoi doujinshi.

01:57:40.980 --> 01:57:46.980
It's just 4chan. It's all things hentai.

01:57:46.980 --> 01:57:52.980
But it's DDR-ish characters. It looks like somebody drew that one.

01:57:52.980 --> 01:57:54.980
It looks like somebody painted that one. It said Max...

01:57:54.980 --> 01:57:59.980
Look! Colors! Beatmania 2DX characters book for adults only.

01:57:59.980 --> 01:58:05.980
Like, the song Colors, and you've got all these girls with big titties standing in front of Colors.

01:58:05.980 --> 01:58:34.860
What is that picture of Tran sitting there where you can totally see her clam?

01:58:34.860 --> 01:58:51.980
is that? Her clam? Wow, way to go there Rob. Welcome to the 90s. I don't care. Now they're

01:58:51.980 --> 01:58:56.580
all posting about it in the chat room. At least she got him to stop typing in random

01:58:56.580 --> 01:59:02.500
four letter words. Now this is going to give more ideas. They're going to try 4chan. Is

01:59:02.500 --> 01:59:11.500
that the orange lounge characters naked? What is wrong? Seriously! Post that link in the

01:59:11.500 --> 01:59:18.780
chatroom. Can you post that link in the chatroom? Somebody found a picture on these bimani style

01:59:18.780 --> 01:59:27.380
porn boards of the orange lounge characters from Mobomoga just naked. Seriously people,

01:59:27.380 --> 01:59:32.860
out of the house. If this is you posting this, this is your homework assignment. You are

01:59:32.860 --> 01:59:40.560
to go outdoors and get at least 3 hours of fresh air this week. And I want you to touch

01:59:40.560 --> 01:59:46.060
a real girl. Make sure you have her permission first and your mom doesn't count, ok? I want

01:59:46.060 --> 01:59:54.420
you to actually go out and touch a real girl. What is? Jamie, look at this one! It's the

01:59:54.420 --> 02:00:00.340
Oh my god, I want to make an icon out of that.

02:00:00.340 --> 02:00:06.340
I want a link to that.

02:00:06.340 --> 02:00:08.820
I just need some heavy breathing to go along with all this.

02:00:08.820 --> 02:00:13.860
Flair O'Nai says that the naked picture of Tartan Toffee should be our new banner for

02:00:13.860 --> 02:00:14.860
Orange Lounge.

02:00:14.860 --> 02:00:15.860
We could do that.

02:00:15.860 --> 02:00:17.060
Well, we do have a site remodeling coming up.

02:00:17.060 --> 02:00:18.060
Hey, how about that?

02:00:18.060 --> 02:00:19.700
We'll just have that in our banner.

02:00:19.700 --> 02:00:20.700
Okay.

02:00:20.700 --> 02:00:22.800
Seen that picture before?

02:00:22.800 --> 02:00:23.800
Forget it.

02:00:23.800 --> 02:00:29.800
I'm done. I'm not going to talk about pornography anymore on the radio. This is pointless, people.

02:00:29.800 --> 02:00:31.800
For the next five minutes.

02:00:31.800 --> 02:00:34.800
Just look at what you missed out on, though, if you're not in the chat room.

02:00:34.800 --> 02:00:36.800
All right, you guys want to know who won the cage match?

02:00:36.800 --> 02:00:37.800
No.

02:00:37.800 --> 02:00:38.800
No?

02:00:38.800 --> 02:00:39.800
Yeah.

02:00:39.800 --> 02:00:40.800
Yeah?

02:00:40.800 --> 02:00:42.800
All right, let's hear who won tonight's cage match.

02:00:42.800 --> 02:00:47.800
The winner of tonight's cage match is...

02:00:47.800 --> 02:01:02.280
Freeze Pop wins tonight.

02:01:02.280 --> 02:01:04.280
And Loki's mad at me.

02:01:04.280 --> 02:01:08.400
Alright, let's go to a break, shall we boys and girls?

02:01:08.400 --> 02:01:14.360
We're gonna go to a break and in this break we gotta get ourselves some more 2DX music

02:01:14.360 --> 02:01:17.440
from 2DX Red because the soundtrack, if you didn't hear, we've been talking about this

02:01:17.440 --> 02:01:22.520
all night. The soundtrack to 2DX Red came out this week, AKA 2DX11 style. That's what

02:01:22.520 --> 02:01:28.360
I've been calling it. I know that's not the real name, and I also don't care, by the way.

02:01:28.360 --> 02:01:31.400
So we've been playing some songs from that all night long, so we're going to keep that

02:01:31.400 --> 02:01:39.840
up. I think what we will play in this break, what are we going to do? I want to play, actually,

02:01:39.840 --> 02:01:44.640
there's a really good song by Sota Fujimori that I want to play. I like that song, so

02:01:44.640 --> 02:01:46.200
So we're going to start it off with that.

02:01:46.200 --> 02:01:49.240
It's called The Hope of Tomorrow, so we're going to start it off with that.

02:01:49.240 --> 02:01:52.160
Maybe we'll do some DJ Simon in this break as well.

02:01:52.160 --> 02:01:57.780
And did we do Don't Be Afraid Myself yet?

02:01:57.780 --> 02:02:01.080
I don't think we did, so we have to do Don't Be Afraid Myself, because I like that song.

02:02:01.080 --> 02:02:02.080
More Freeze Pop.

02:02:02.080 --> 02:02:04.360
No, no, more Freeze Pop tonight.

02:02:04.360 --> 02:02:08.740
And I guess, should we do the Polteri one?

02:02:08.740 --> 02:02:09.740
Why not?

02:02:09.740 --> 02:02:11.620
I'm feeling, I'm feeling risky tonight.

02:02:11.620 --> 02:02:13.340
We're going to do, it's not Naoki.

02:02:13.340 --> 02:02:16.740
June featuring Polteri. So I have no hope.

02:02:16.740 --> 02:02:21.380
We're gonna see how that is raspberry heart. All right, we're gonna play all those songs and we'll be back after this

02:03:16.740 --> 02:03:20.740
And maybe you won't expect this

02:03:20.740 --> 02:03:27.240
And I will appear as I go

02:03:27.240 --> 02:03:29.740
I can't help

02:07:59.740 --> 02:08:01.740
Oh

02:08:59.740 --> 02:09:04.740
Yeah! Come on, let's go!

02:09:29.740 --> 02:09:39.740
Well I'll be there for you

02:09:39.740 --> 02:09:45.740
I wanted to be the one to talk to you

02:09:45.740 --> 02:09:51.740
Why I can't always be left behind

02:09:51.740 --> 02:09:54.740
I know you wanted to say goodbye

02:09:54.740 --> 02:09:57.740
But you said you'd stay, I wonder why

02:09:57.740 --> 02:10:03.740
But I know that I wanna be with you forever and ever

02:10:03.740 --> 02:10:05.740
Hey, you're so true

02:10:05.740 --> 02:10:07.740
Make you feel ashamed once again

02:10:07.740 --> 02:10:11.740
Our hearts will fly to take us back up to the sky

02:10:11.740 --> 02:10:15.740
I even have to bring up the vibes in me

02:10:15.740 --> 02:10:17.740
Bring the vibes out of your heart

02:10:17.740 --> 02:10:19.740
When you've done it, you've taken it

02:10:19.740 --> 02:10:21.740
Where are you?

02:10:21.740 --> 02:10:23.740
Don't you know that it's so true?

02:10:23.740 --> 02:10:30.740
I'll always be there for you my raspberry horn, raspberry horn, raspberry horn

02:10:31.740 --> 02:10:37.740
Gaming radio, so uncensored, that even Tom Brokaw could get a job with us.

02:10:37.740 --> 02:10:39.740
Uh, B-B-Bukawky?

02:10:39.740 --> 02:10:41.740
Orange Lounge Radio.

02:10:41.740 --> 02:10:42.740
Thanks, Tom.

02:10:46.740 --> 02:10:49.740
We're back. Sorry about that, that last song got cut off a little bit.

02:10:49.740 --> 02:10:52.740
I'm sure none of you guys minded that much, because it is voluntary.

02:10:52.740 --> 02:11:03.740
I'm kidding, but apparently one of my macros in IRC happens to control my Winamp, and that is why I'm not going to install more of these crappy scripts into my, uh, MIRC anymore.

02:11:03.740 --> 02:11:12.740
So, apologies for that, but at least you got a little taste there of Politary, June featuring Politary with Raspberry Heart.

02:11:12.740 --> 02:11:16.520
very hard and I so wasn't ready to come back from break damn it oh well that's

02:11:16.520 --> 02:11:22.940
all right what we're gonna do now is we got the TV thingy hooked up do you need

02:11:22.940 --> 02:11:30.100
some time to get that done or is already hooked up for what she's got well I just

02:11:30.100 --> 02:11:34.740
don't know how to set it up that's good we're good to go all right Jamie wants

02:11:34.740 --> 02:11:40.600
to share with us another follow-up to something from last week this has been a

02:11:40.600 --> 02:11:44.680
running thing for like two weeks now is well Jamie I'll let you set this up for

02:11:44.680 --> 02:11:50.500
the listeners what's going on here I brought the Japanese version of Dracula

02:11:50.500 --> 02:11:55.000
X to not turn in the moonlight that came out over here as Castlevania Symphony of

02:11:55.000 --> 02:12:00.220
the night I brought the precursor I brought with me Dracula X for the PC

02:12:00.220 --> 02:12:04.360
engine duo so this is kind of neat because she actually had to bring her

02:12:04.360 --> 02:12:10.200
whole little system here, a TurboDuo, which is ages old for a game system.

02:12:10.200 --> 02:12:13.480
And it's like one of the first CD systems. It's like we're having a classic gaming expo

02:12:13.480 --> 02:12:16.840
in my house right now. It's awesome. Well this game goes for eBay from anywhere

02:12:16.840 --> 02:12:22.960
between $150 to $350. We actually didn't pay for ours, it was used to pay us back when

02:12:22.960 --> 02:12:27.680
someone owed us $100. She picked it up for us in Japan for about

02:12:27.680 --> 02:12:35.120
ten for about a about a hundred dollars okay Wow I'm turning it on now and be

02:12:35.120 --> 02:12:40.380
watching the webcam okay so if you want to check out the webcam go to www.orange

02:12:40.380 --> 02:12:45.140
launch radio.com the webcams right there so look at it people view the old

02:12:45.140 --> 02:12:49.860
schoolness of the super CD-ROM 2 system of course if you're listening to us on

02:12:49.860 --> 02:12:53.820
like a rebroadcast or something such as the one that happens on DDR freak radio

02:12:53.820 --> 02:12:58.180
every Friday night. You don't get to participate along with the webcam because it's not going

02:12:58.180 --> 02:13:02.500
on right now, but at least you get to hear us kind of talk about it. So now, I notice

02:13:02.500 --> 02:13:09.580
the boot-up screen here for this system you've got, it says Super CD-ROM 2 system, like,

02:13:09.580 --> 02:13:16.100
but it says CD-ROM squared. What the hell's the 2?

02:13:16.100 --> 02:13:23.220
I think it's because it's a dual-speed CD. Oh my gosh, it's lightning fast then. It's

02:13:23.220 --> 02:13:24.220
It's a dual-speed CD.

02:13:24.220 --> 02:13:25.220
It's a Saturn.

02:13:25.220 --> 02:13:26.220
Amazing.

02:13:26.220 --> 02:13:27.220
It's blazing fast.

02:13:27.220 --> 02:13:28.220
Anyway, this is the...

02:13:28.220 --> 02:13:36.220
I'm going to go ahead and let the whole intro play through because it's in German.

02:13:36.220 --> 02:13:39.940
And our listeners want nothing more than to hear German right now, I'm sure.

02:13:39.940 --> 02:13:43.100
I might skip through some of it, but...

02:13:43.100 --> 02:13:44.100
I can't hear it.

02:13:44.100 --> 02:13:45.100
Oh, there we go.

02:13:45.100 --> 02:13:46.100
Oh, I hear it.

02:13:46.100 --> 02:13:47.100
Remember the old Konami sound?

02:13:47.100 --> 02:13:50.220
Oh, I used to love that sound when I put it in a Super Nintendo game.

02:13:50.220 --> 02:13:51.220
Beautiful.

02:13:51.220 --> 02:13:52.660
Up, up, down, down, left, right, left, right.

02:13:52.660 --> 02:13:53.660
I hear it a little bit.

02:13:56.660 --> 02:13:57.660
It's quiet, but I hear it.

02:14:03.660 --> 02:14:04.660
There we go.

02:14:08.660 --> 02:14:10.660
So what is this part all about here, Dark Sacra?

02:14:11.660 --> 02:14:13.660
They're sacrificing virgins to bring back Dracula.

02:14:13.660 --> 02:14:15.660
Dracula. Awesome.

02:14:31.660 --> 02:14:37.660
There's the Virgin. This is awesome because it's German with Japanese subtitles.

02:14:37.660 --> 02:14:40.660
And I hope people are saving these for me, please.

02:14:45.660 --> 02:14:47.660
Ooh, there's a good shot of the Virgin there on the webcam.

02:14:50.660 --> 02:14:53.660
Ooh, they killed the Virgin! Oh no, she did. Oh no, they didn't.

02:14:55.660 --> 02:14:57.660
She likes to be a Virgin, huh?

02:14:57.660 --> 02:15:04.660
...

02:15:06.160 --> 02:15:09.460
Clarify something in the chat room, because we don't have motion going on right now.

02:15:09.460 --> 02:15:11.160
Is there a full motion video on this game?

02:15:11.160 --> 02:15:14.160
It's fake motion. You know, like...

02:15:14.160 --> 02:15:16.160
Like Ninja Gaiden cinematics.

02:15:16.160 --> 02:15:17.160
Yeah.

02:15:17.160 --> 02:15:20.160
It has some animation.

02:15:20.160 --> 02:15:22.160
It's spread over stills.

02:15:22.160 --> 02:15:29.160
The only word I understood in the whole thing was flighter mouth, which is fat.

02:15:33.160 --> 02:15:36.160
I understood a heck of a lot more than that.

02:15:36.160 --> 02:15:37.160
Ooh, what did it say?

02:15:37.160 --> 02:15:38.160
It says you suck.

02:15:38.160 --> 02:15:39.160
No.

02:15:39.160 --> 02:15:42.160
No, it actually just said Loki sucks because he doesn't like freeze pops.

02:15:42.160 --> 02:15:47.160
Okay, there's one more bit of the intro I'm going to play after that, the other one I

02:15:47.160 --> 02:15:48.160
showed you.

02:15:48.160 --> 02:15:50.160
And then, here it is.

02:15:50.160 --> 02:15:54.720
Victor the school teacher why do you feel the need to share this with our

02:15:54.720 --> 02:15:59.280
listeners this is the kind of culture they need to be educated in the way to

02:15:59.280 --> 02:16:01.880
the old school

02:16:02.120 --> 02:16:09.560
who is Japanese user like the best bit of jacket of what I love about this game

02:16:09.560 --> 02:16:14.680
is to have a lot of updated Castlevania themes in it oh my god well and updated

02:16:14.680 --> 02:16:18.520
for that time and I'll tell you what for our chat room I'm willing to mp3 the

02:16:18.520 --> 02:16:24.880
a whole CD for you. This music really speaks to me. It sends the message to me that free

02:16:24.880 --> 02:16:31.880
pop is an actual music and it sucks! That's what it says to me. The way it looks on the

02:16:31.880 --> 02:16:38.840
The way it looks on the webcam, it almost looks like the skeletons are dancing.

02:16:38.840 --> 02:16:55.840
Yeah, it's thriller all of a sudden, some of the dicks.

02:16:55.840 --> 02:16:56.840
Dracula.

02:16:56.840 --> 02:16:59.720
Okay, so I'll play a little bit of it.

02:16:59.720 --> 02:17:09.720
But you have to hear, though, Maria, because Maria is a playable character in this, and she's a cheesy little girl in a pink dress, that there's birds.

02:17:09.720 --> 02:17:18.720
Yeah, what the hell is that? That's, you know, maybe I'm just out of touch with the whole, you know, Castlevania slash Dracula series, but what the hell is up with the throwing birds?

02:17:18.720 --> 02:17:22.720
All the characters always had a whip, or like a knife or something.

02:17:22.720 --> 02:17:26.880
whole manly ending where he's marching out of the castle triumphant and Maria

02:17:26.880 --> 02:17:30.480
has one where she's being followed by her little animal friends skipping while

02:17:30.480 --> 02:17:34.900
there's happy music playing. Jamie stop making the grudge noise. And also this

02:17:34.900 --> 02:17:40.040
should sound familiar though. I always love that satanic church music that

02:17:40.040 --> 02:17:46.040
have? See, for anyone who's ever played this on the Super Nintendo, it gives you a hint,

02:17:46.040 --> 02:17:51.720
but this is, you can tell that Symphony of the Night is definitely a secret. You know,

02:17:51.720 --> 02:17:56.920
this would be good music to play, like, say, I don't know, before a certain wedding in

02:17:56.920 --> 02:18:02.240
a church. Dude, that would be great! I should play that before my wedding. So let's see,

02:18:02.240 --> 02:18:12.760
we want Maria or do it Richter Maria sounded like Chun Li there yeah she did

02:18:12.760 --> 02:18:18.480
go get that all right I'll go ahead and start with whatever the hell this

02:18:18.480 --> 02:18:23.560
difficult level is I know I should start with the very beginning just start music

02:18:23.560 --> 02:18:40.880
I'm being soothed by the music. Hey, run away. I'm not soothed. Soothe me. Okay. Jamie's

02:18:40.880 --> 02:18:52.560
playing for a little bit here. And then they ate the minstrels. I get to fight death now.

02:18:52.560 --> 02:19:01.560
So, in the game right now, Jamie is riding on a horseback in carriage or something.

02:19:01.560 --> 02:19:11.560
The graphic, by the way, should look familiar at the beginning of the night.

02:19:11.560 --> 02:19:18.560
And Van Helsing completely ripped the scene off, I might add.

02:19:18.560 --> 02:19:22.540
For people that said that Van Helsing was Castlevania the movie

02:19:23.240 --> 02:19:30.560
Screw you because honestly Van Helsing sucked and a Castlevania movie would be awesome. They would not do that to a Castlevania movie

02:19:31.320 --> 02:19:33.320
Actually, they would that's the problem

02:19:33.800 --> 02:19:41.500
There were no flying vampire babies in Castlevania as far as I'm aware. There were the flying monkeys, but the

02:19:41.500 --> 02:19:46.500
I also want people to pay attention if they happen to make it to the camp.

02:19:46.500 --> 02:19:51.500
The opening graphic you'll remember is exactly the same as it was on Symphony of the Night.

02:19:51.500 --> 02:19:56.500
Which is funny because the opening graphic has a little upside down blue triangle when you play as Richter.

02:19:56.500 --> 02:20:01.500
But when you play as Maria, it's an upside down pink triangle.

02:20:01.500 --> 02:20:06.500
And for you fellow family, aka homos out there, you know what an upside down pink triangle means.

02:20:36.500 --> 02:20:43.500
the Saturn and not turn in the moonlight. I'll do it. I have a Saturn. I have a few

02:20:44.340 --> 02:20:51.020
Saturns actually. I may have a completed save file on that one. Awesome. Now what I love

02:20:51.020 --> 02:20:54.840
about this part of the game too is it looks like she's actually going through the old

02:20:54.840 --> 02:21:01.180
town in Castlevania. And Jamie's saying it is the old town from Castlevania 2, Simon's

02:21:01.180 --> 02:21:05.260
Quest. So for those of you guys that are looking on the webcam right now, you're like, damn

02:21:05.260 --> 02:21:09.260
It looks like the same graphics they had in Simon's Quest. Well, it is.

02:21:19.260 --> 02:21:22.260
Just sounds like a bunch of broken glass everywhere right now.

02:21:22.260 --> 02:21:24.260
Whoa, hey, what was that?

02:21:24.260 --> 02:21:31.260
As I mentioned before when we were watching her play this earlier, it sounds like the same sound effects from Mega Man.

02:21:31.260 --> 02:21:38.260
But they're two different companies. Mega Man is Capcom. Castlevania is Konami. How the hell do you figure?

02:21:43.260 --> 02:21:46.260
There's a hidden place that I can't get to with Richter.

02:21:46.260 --> 02:21:47.260
Don't.

02:21:47.260 --> 02:21:57.620
Anyway, Loki, Castlevania is Konami, Mega Man is Capcom, they cannot share the sound

02:21:57.620 --> 02:22:00.660
effects, the world would explode.

02:22:00.660 --> 02:22:01.660
No.

02:22:01.660 --> 02:22:05.620
What the hell was that?

02:22:05.620 --> 02:22:07.620
That was dinner.

02:22:07.620 --> 02:22:11.900
Shumi says it was the gargoyle.

02:22:11.900 --> 02:22:19.600
See, it's almost like being at somebody's house, watching them play games, except in

02:22:19.600 --> 02:22:28.840
this case you have your back turned and you only get to look once every 30 seconds.

02:22:28.840 --> 02:22:30.240
You just gotta wonder what you're missing.

02:22:30.240 --> 02:22:31.240
Oh, what happened?

02:22:31.240 --> 02:22:32.240
The music stopped.

02:22:32.240 --> 02:22:33.240
Oh, load time.

02:22:33.240 --> 02:22:35.240
Make your own music, yay!

02:22:35.240 --> 02:22:38.440
Oh, here we go.

02:22:38.440 --> 02:22:42.440
Are you fighting the boss right now?

02:22:42.440 --> 02:22:47.440
Yeah, you died last time you fought this boss.

02:22:47.440 --> 02:22:52.440
This sounds 8-bit. This song sounds 8-bit.

02:22:52.440 --> 02:22:57.440
Excuse me.

02:22:58.440 --> 02:23:00.440
Excuse me again.

02:23:00.440 --> 02:23:07.440
I don't know what I ate.

02:23:09.340 --> 02:23:16.340
Loki! Stop that!

02:23:21.320 --> 02:23:25.080
Jamie died. No, she's not dead yet.

02:23:25.080 --> 02:23:27.440
Now she's... Oh!

02:23:27.440 --> 02:23:29.320
Did you hear that sound?

02:23:29.320 --> 02:23:36.320
I swear to God that was the sound it made when you died in like Zelda.

02:23:37.400 --> 02:23:41.400
You need the axe for this. You always needed the axe for the first boss in any

02:23:41.400 --> 02:23:45.840
Castlevania game. What's up with that?

02:23:45.840 --> 02:23:50.160
Alright.

02:23:50.160 --> 02:23:52.760
What?

02:23:52.760 --> 02:23:56.360
Jamie's just trying to get to the next level so you can hear the music because it is

02:23:56.360 --> 02:23:58.880
really awesome.

02:23:58.880 --> 02:24:01.160
And then after that, we're going to go into the FUs of the Week.

02:24:01.160 --> 02:24:04.040
So you guys, by the way, if you're in our chat room right now,

02:24:04.040 --> 02:24:05.880
you can send those FUs of the Week.

02:24:05.880 --> 02:24:08.880
Just send a private message to Sky in the chat room with your FU.

02:24:23.480 --> 02:24:24.800
Did you kill it?

02:24:24.800 --> 02:24:25.400
She killed it.

02:24:25.400 --> 02:24:25.900
Yay.

02:24:25.900 --> 02:24:27.960
I killed it.

02:24:27.960 --> 02:24:34.960
What's up with the disco ball? Like, the crystal that drops on the ceiling is like a little disco ball. It's crazy.

02:24:36.960 --> 02:24:37.960
Makes you want to dance.

02:24:38.960 --> 02:24:42.960
Ooh, it's sparkling. It's a sparkling disco ball.

02:24:43.960 --> 02:24:45.960
And as you can see, it's a red ball with fire in it.

02:24:46.960 --> 02:24:48.960
Well, the cam hasn't updated yet, so I can't see it, but...

02:24:48.960 --> 02:24:49.960
Sorry.

02:24:49.960 --> 02:24:50.960
That's alright.

02:24:52.960 --> 02:24:53.960
I know that noise.

02:24:53.960 --> 02:24:59.960
Believe it or not, I actually like the first level music better on the Super Nintendo version, but all the rest of it's better.

02:25:02.960 --> 02:25:07.960
Alright, now you have to hear the music at the beginning of the stage. It's the whole reason we played this whole first stage.

02:25:07.960 --> 02:25:10.960
I forgot, I also have Sound Test open.

02:25:16.960 --> 02:25:18.960
Sound familiar?

02:25:18.960 --> 02:25:23.960
p0k3smot42o1 the way the bird squawks right at the pause in the song

02:25:48.960 --> 02:25:52.960
Alright. Alright, we're gonna wrap it up for this segment.

02:25:52.960 --> 02:25:56.960
Wait, wait, what? One more thing? Oh, okay.

02:25:56.960 --> 02:26:00.960
Um, I'm gonna actually play a song that I want to be my F music.

02:26:00.960 --> 02:26:04.960
Okay, just for this once.

02:26:04.960 --> 02:26:08.960
Alright, well I'm gonna turn down the volume until you get to that part.

02:26:08.960 --> 02:26:12.960
Well great, what are we supposed to talk about in the meantime? I have no idea.

02:26:12.960 --> 02:26:16.960
Now what are we supposed to do?

02:26:16.960 --> 02:26:23.360
test okay well that that won't take that long no just because this is my favorite

02:26:23.360 --> 02:26:27.220
piece of music in the game and I forgot the sound test existed I guess what I'll

02:26:27.220 --> 02:26:30.000
do for a minute here while I queue up the F use of the week which by the way

02:26:30.000 --> 02:26:33.200
you guys should be sitting in I'll take a moment to plug our spin-off shows

02:26:33.200 --> 02:26:37.820
Monday night on Orange Lounge radio diversion the Orange Lounge radio remix

02:26:37.820 --> 02:26:42.240
show a bunch of your favorite remixes not only just I can hear your computer

02:26:42.240 --> 02:26:45.160
Sorry buddy.

02:26:45.160 --> 02:26:47.040
It is.

02:26:47.040 --> 02:26:48.040
I hear it.

02:26:48.040 --> 02:26:50.840
And so do our listeners.

02:26:50.840 --> 02:26:57.420
Whatever your working on there, I just heard in my speaker.

02:26:57.420 --> 02:26:59.000
Listener!

02:26:59.000 --> 02:27:00.520
Listeners!

02:27:00.520 --> 02:27:02.060
Tell Loki you can hear it.

02:27:02.060 --> 02:27:04.440
Well they're fucking wrong.

02:27:04.440 --> 02:27:06.120
Because look, fliers.

02:27:06.120 --> 02:27:09.120
It's on our computer.

02:27:09.120 --> 02:27:10.640
Try it again.

02:27:10.640 --> 02:27:11.640
I don't hear it now.

02:27:11.640 --> 02:27:17.920
I hear it oh no that was the TV right there okay but I'm telling you I heard

02:27:17.920 --> 02:27:22.520
whatever this thing was it's uh it's you're doing it I can tell it is anyway

02:27:22.520 --> 02:27:27.880
found it you guys don't care anyway not yet not yet yeah not yet keep it down

02:27:27.880 --> 02:27:35.160
God we're gonna get into the F use of the week oh yeah before I fit I needed

02:27:35.160 --> 02:27:41.000
to talk to keep finishing up our spin-off programming all right Tuesday

02:27:41.000 --> 02:27:45.400
night pump up the volume 7 o'clock or what says 730 for show but 645 is for

02:27:45.400 --> 02:27:48.640
pre-show Thursday night outside the box 7 o'clock when we feel like doing a show

02:27:48.640 --> 02:27:52.240
we do one all right now I can do Jamie why do we have to do the F use of the

02:27:52.240 --> 02:27:55.280
week every week because we're angry but this music is too happy to be angry

02:27:55.280 --> 02:27:57.400
about

02:27:57.400 --> 02:28:13.840
um I'm angry about the woman with the cookies okay this is the only thing I'm really angry

02:28:13.840 --> 02:28:21.920
about there was this couple of girls not be posting a link in the chat room soon but they

02:28:21.920 --> 02:28:25.480
went around their neighborhood passing out cookies and they were leaving them on doorsteps

02:28:25.480 --> 02:28:30.560
of surprises. This one woman sued them for causing her anxiety because they knocked on

02:28:30.560 --> 02:28:36.280
the door, she didn't answer, and so they left them and ran as a surprise. Well, they offered

02:28:36.280 --> 02:28:40.760
to pay her medical damages, so she did apparently get checked into the hospital for nearly having

02:28:40.760 --> 02:28:47.760
a heart attack or something. And instead, she sued them for the punitive damages. Well,

02:28:48.520 --> 02:28:54.720
she didn't win that, but she did win what the girls offered her anyway. So, it's a big

02:28:54.720 --> 02:29:01.720
Also, a big F.U. to all of you school children who do not believe in the goddamn first amendment.

02:29:01.720 --> 02:29:12.720
There was a survey done saying that something like 80% of students I think should believe the government has control over our public media.

02:29:12.720 --> 02:29:14.720
That's in direct violation of the first amendment.

02:29:14.720 --> 02:29:17.720
We also don't know how to properly dispose of the flag either.

02:29:17.720 --> 02:29:19.720
I think that vibrating is illegal.

02:29:19.720 --> 02:29:23.720
Um, I think that that's really stupid.

02:29:23.720 --> 02:29:27.720
Just a big F-you to general ignorance of damn near everybody.

02:29:27.720 --> 02:29:31.720
And I blame their parents. That's it.

02:29:31.720 --> 02:29:35.720
Loki's turn!

02:29:35.720 --> 02:29:39.720
I want to get this cold, because I've had a sore throat for like

02:29:39.720 --> 02:29:43.720
an entire week, and that's really the only symptom that I have from that being congested.

02:29:43.720 --> 02:29:47.720
So, that kind of sucks, because talking on the phone

02:29:47.720 --> 02:29:54.440
all day at work, and he just irritates it, and that's no picnic. And then, fuck you to

02:29:54.440 --> 02:30:01.440
stupid, lame-ass people with cell phones. God damn it, I want a law to be passed where

02:30:01.440 --> 02:30:06.240
people cannot drive with cell phones. In fact, there was a fucking study done that people

02:30:06.240 --> 02:30:10.440
are more dangerous driving with cell phones than they would be intoxicated.

02:30:10.440 --> 02:30:11.760
You're making it illegal.

02:30:11.760 --> 02:30:14.760
Thank God! Because you know what? People can't fucking do it.

02:30:14.760 --> 02:30:18.560
I've been in a car with you talking on your cell phone.

02:30:18.560 --> 02:30:24.120
I just use speakerphone. Doesn't matter, even, even with speakerphone, there's still the

02:30:24.120 --> 02:30:28.840
reaction time is much worse. The impending, although, was supposed to make provisions for hands-free.

02:30:28.840 --> 02:30:34.160
So, you know what? So that goes for all you women out there driving those SUVs

02:30:34.160 --> 02:30:38.080
and with those stupid cell phones. Ha! You can't do it any longer!

02:30:38.080 --> 02:30:41.120
So, to hell with you people. Anyways,

02:30:41.120 --> 02:30:48.120
Then also, um, fuck you to the goddamn Indian casinos, actually, because, you know, I think

02:30:48.120 --> 02:30:52.200
it's quite funny that people go there and spend all their money, oh, look at, this is

02:30:52.200 --> 02:30:57.080
as nice because they have, you know, all this, we can go gamble and stuff, but guess what,

02:30:57.080 --> 02:31:01.120
you don't win, they're just doing a reverse rapeage on you, okay, they're just gonna rape

02:31:01.120 --> 02:31:07.340
you of your money, because we raped them of their land, so, you know, I don't feel sorry

02:31:07.340 --> 02:31:14.040
for anyone that goes there and loses all their money. So to hell with them. And I think that's

02:31:14.040 --> 02:31:18.000
pretty much it for now because I can't really think of anything else. There was another

02:31:18.000 --> 02:31:32.320
thing I was thinking of earlier, but it's gone, so that'll be it. My turn. My first

02:31:32.320 --> 02:31:37.480
First F.U. goes to Loki for having two F.U.s that were involving me somehow in some way

02:31:37.480 --> 02:31:42.360
because A. I love talking on my cell phone while I drive and I do it just fine, and B.

02:31:42.360 --> 02:31:48.360
I lost $75 at the casino last night, but I don't care, I had fun and I won $100 the last

02:31:48.360 --> 02:31:49.360
time I was there.

02:31:49.360 --> 02:31:53.260
But on that note, F.U. to the fact that I was not able to keep up my winning streak

02:31:53.260 --> 02:31:56.220
last night, that made me sad, but oh well.

02:31:56.220 --> 02:32:00.540
I had fun while it lasted, even though it didn't last very long, but then again, neither

02:32:00.540 --> 02:32:01.540
do orgasms.

02:32:01.540 --> 02:32:05.540
Um, what else did I give an FU to?

02:32:05.540 --> 02:32:10.040
Uh, an FU to just, like, hangovers. That's a big one.

02:32:10.040 --> 02:32:19.540
Uh, an FU to drama in general, because there's just drama sometimes, and it makes things messy, and that's all I can say about that, really.

02:32:21.040 --> 02:32:26.040
Let's move on. Let's talk to some of the other folks that are here in studio. Angel?

02:32:26.040 --> 02:32:34.040
All right, uh, F.U. to my instructor, because, uh, I'm saying something I did- or, saying I did something that I didn't do.

02:32:34.040 --> 02:32:36.040
And that's all that needs to be said about that.

02:32:36.040 --> 02:32:43.040
Uh, F.U. to myself for not giving myself enough sleep during the week. I think that happens to all of us at one point or another.

02:32:43.040 --> 02:32:49.040
Uh, and other than that, uh, not much, because I'm not really that angsty.

02:32:49.040 --> 02:32:52.040
But then again, when am I ever that angsty?

02:32:52.040 --> 02:32:56.040
Mmm, you've been like borderline angsty, I've seen.

02:32:56.040 --> 02:33:00.040
Alright. Uhh, bugged.

02:33:00.040 --> 02:33:04.040
Just a nice little FU to low-key about freeze-pop.

02:33:04.040 --> 02:33:08.040
You demob-ass. He just will not let that drop!

02:33:08.040 --> 02:33:12.040
He will not drop the freeze-pop grudge.

02:33:12.040 --> 02:33:16.040
Oh boy. We're not supposed to drop demob-ass, everyone's supposed to say it.

02:33:16.040 --> 02:33:20.040
It's gonna be the next... Deathcake.

02:33:20.040 --> 02:33:22.040
What the fuck is Deathcake?

02:33:23.040 --> 02:33:25.040
Is it an Eddie-user? Oh, okay.

02:33:26.040 --> 02:33:30.040
We brought up the cake or death with the Vicar or Die and Deathcake.

02:33:33.040 --> 02:33:36.040
I thought you had a response to that look, that's why I gave you the mic.

02:33:36.040 --> 02:33:38.040
Alright, is that it, Bug?

02:33:38.040 --> 02:33:39.040
Yeah.

02:33:39.040 --> 02:33:41.040
Alright. Chat room time!

02:33:41.040 --> 02:33:44.040
Let's see what the folks on the chat room have to say. Yeah, I know, who cares.

02:33:44.040 --> 02:33:50.760
illusion says F you to Jamster for just being Jamster and being on every

02:33:50.760 --> 02:33:56.000
commercial break you know who owns Jamster who you got to be kidding no

02:33:56.000 --> 02:34:02.060
they're a subsidiary of Versailles Jesus okay here you go guys there's actually a

02:34:02.060 --> 02:34:05.900
petition on the internet to stop Jamster and I would urge you all to sign it even

02:34:05.900 --> 02:34:09.480
though I'm not huge on internet petitions this is one I can believe in I

02:34:09.480 --> 02:34:13.880
don't care if it has like minimal impact if we can stop one Jamster commercial

02:34:13.880 --> 02:34:16.880
We've done our job.

02:34:16.880 --> 02:34:19.880
Illusion also says, an F you to Shakey's.

02:34:19.880 --> 02:34:22.880
Stopping their karaoke right before my friends and I got there.

02:34:22.880 --> 02:34:24.880
So we didn't get to do Love Shack again.

02:34:24.880 --> 02:34:28.880
Hey, that's the song that Iguana Girl and I always do, is Love Shack.

02:34:28.880 --> 02:34:32.880
We did it on this show once, actually.

02:34:32.880 --> 02:34:37.880
KK Slider says, F you to Final Fantasy XI, taking my life.

02:34:37.880 --> 02:34:42.880
I sympathize. What, Jamie? What did you say to KK Slider?

02:34:42.880 --> 02:34:43.880
Oh.

02:34:43.880 --> 02:34:44.880
Addict.

02:34:44.880 --> 02:34:45.880
Jamie says, Addict.

02:34:45.880 --> 02:34:50.920
AznBuddyPaul says, F you to heartbreakers.

02:34:50.920 --> 02:34:55.620
There have been like two gazillion breakups lately.

02:34:55.620 --> 02:34:58.880
You just, maybe you just a playa.

02:34:58.880 --> 02:35:06.320
Sephiroth1215 says, F you to no service pack 8 yet and no 2DX in America yet even though

02:35:06.320 --> 02:35:08.560
I have a feeling it will be soon.

02:35:08.560 --> 02:35:10.280
Song pack, I always say service pack.

02:35:10.280 --> 02:35:12.640
Song pack 8.

02:35:12.640 --> 02:35:18.480
Sephiroth1215 also says, and f you for no outside the box once again, I have more fun

02:35:18.480 --> 02:35:19.480
on that show.

02:35:19.480 --> 02:35:22.600
Well, I'm sure the others are pleased to hear that.

02:35:22.600 --> 02:35:28.080
What can I say, real life gets in the way sometimes, we'll see, we'll see what happens.

02:35:28.080 --> 02:35:32.600
Legend of Zaku says, f you to the fact I'm still unemployed, f you to wasting away my

02:35:32.600 --> 02:35:37.360
body by not eating right, thus losing my stamina when playing DDR, and f you to Valentine's

02:35:37.360 --> 02:35:41.240
Day coming up next week, and me still not having a Valentine.

02:35:41.240 --> 02:35:48.240
Jaded2005 says, F you to my computer for acting weird at the worst possible time yesterday

02:35:48.560 --> 02:35:53.560
while playing Doom 3. And what time would that be?

02:35:53.560 --> 02:36:00.560
Flaronay says, F you to the Super Bowl. Oh no, I'm sorry. I didn't read this right.

02:36:03.840 --> 02:36:08.840
It says, F you to the Super Bow movement in parentheses. F you to the Super Bow.

02:36:08.840 --> 02:36:12.840
I think I had one of those earlier.

02:36:12.840 --> 02:36:16.840
And who won? The Patriots or the Eagles?

02:36:16.840 --> 02:36:20.840
The Wet Ones.

02:36:20.840 --> 02:36:24.840
One FU for tonight.

02:36:24.840 --> 02:36:28.840
FU to EvilMaoki2Dx for making me spit water on the wall

02:36:28.840 --> 02:36:32.840
so many times every time he sent me pictures.

02:36:32.840 --> 02:36:36.840
Would those be 4chan pictures?

02:36:36.840 --> 02:36:42.840
directed at certain people, but that, you know, I can tell that, you know, that's a light-hearted F.U., so those are okay.

02:36:42.840 --> 02:36:46.840
I know who won the Super Bowl movement, it was the Browns.

02:36:46.840 --> 02:36:52.840
You're welcome.

02:36:52.840 --> 02:36:57.840
Do I have to come back next week? I thought Lanky Sal made the worst jokes possible.

02:36:57.840 --> 02:37:01.840
Where do you think he learned them from?

02:37:01.840 --> 02:37:07.840
VX JasonXV, resident webmaster and slave boy will be his official title with the new business structure.

02:37:07.840 --> 02:37:13.840
FU to work, constant FU to work. I don't like all the workload being pushed off on me.

02:37:17.840 --> 02:37:21.840
Right Shannon Joyce says, Joyce says FU to the world.

02:37:21.840 --> 02:37:32.840
And EvilMaoki2Dx would like to say, one quick FU for Ragnarok Online. Taking my life away.

02:37:32.840 --> 02:37:41.840
Korean knock-off. I miss Ragnarok. Korean life-sucking game, right?

02:37:41.840 --> 02:37:49.840
What? Ragnarok? Yeah, Ragnarok's another one of those life-sucking MMORPGs that you play and you start going,

02:37:49.840 --> 02:37:51.840
How did I ever get into this in the first place?

02:37:51.840 --> 02:37:57.840
I did like Ragnarok, though. It was so cute. I will play Ragnarok, too, probably.

02:37:57.840 --> 02:38:02.840
And people that know me know that I don't really have a whole lot of time for those other MMORPGs,

02:38:02.840 --> 02:38:05.840
but I will give Ragnarok Online 2 a chance.

02:38:05.840 --> 02:38:08.840
It was adorable.

02:38:08.840 --> 02:38:12.600
I'm sorry, I still had that picture for the longest time on my phone

02:38:12.600 --> 02:38:17.160
of your mage and my assassin. Seriously, where else could me,

02:38:17.160 --> 02:38:20.720
a guy, get a character with red spiky hair like I have in real life sometimes

02:38:20.720 --> 02:38:25.040
and then get a big purple bow to wear in my hair? That bow gave me plus one intelligence.

02:38:25.040 --> 02:38:28.160
What other MMORPG will let me wear a big purple

02:38:28.160 --> 02:38:32.480
feminine bow in my hair? And I never did get one of the huge ass ribbons

02:38:32.480 --> 02:38:36.000
though, that's what made me sad. You know, I had almost got you one until you said that you

02:38:36.000 --> 02:38:41.200
quit. I might have come back just for the big ribbon.

02:38:41.200 --> 02:38:45.080
Wasn't there a cake song about that?

02:38:45.080 --> 02:38:50.360
I don't, a ribbon? Pretty pink ribbon or something like that?

02:38:50.360 --> 02:38:54.920
Something like that, I don't know. Alright, we're gonna go to

02:38:54.920 --> 02:38:58.880
another break here when we come back. We're gonna head on over to

02:38:58.880 --> 02:39:02.440
DDR Freak and check out our DDR

02:39:02.440 --> 02:39:05.620
chit-chat post of the week and we're gonna chit-chat about it a little bit

02:39:05.620 --> 02:39:10.360
here in studio as well. So we're gonna do that when we come back after this break

02:39:10.360 --> 02:39:17.320
featuring some more music from 2DX Red and we're gonna start it off with... we'll

02:39:17.320 --> 02:39:21.640
start off with a song that you actually saw in 8th style as well if you picked

02:39:21.640 --> 02:39:25.000
up the home version but it's a good song. It really is a good song and it's worth

02:39:25.000 --> 02:39:29.080
playing again. It's Spiral Galaxy. Enjoy guys. We'll be back with more Orange

02:39:29.080 --> 02:39:36.080
launch radio.

02:41:59.080 --> 02:42:01.080
Can I live?

02:42:03.080 --> 02:42:05.080
You've changed me now.

02:42:05.080 --> 02:42:07.080
I can fly.

02:42:07.080 --> 02:42:14.080
It's my life, it's my life, it's my life.

02:43:07.080 --> 02:43:35.080
It's my life, it's my life It's my life, it's my life

02:45:05.080 --> 02:45:12.080
And now, let's listen to the music.

02:45:35.080 --> 02:45:40.240
into an Orange Lounge Radio staff meeting as they debate some of the new

02:45:40.240 --> 02:45:43.280
programming coming to Orange Lounge Radio.

02:45:43.280 --> 02:45:47.780
Um, Jamie, I have a suggestion about some of the music in our Bamani Music & More program.

02:45:47.780 --> 02:45:48.980
Can we talk about that?

02:45:48.980 --> 02:45:51.580
No subject will ever be taboo.

02:45:51.580 --> 02:45:55.580
Well, I was thinking maybe we should move, pump up the volume from Tuesday nights?

02:45:55.580 --> 02:45:58.580
Except, of course, the subject that was just on our discussion.

02:45:58.580 --> 02:46:04.580
Okay, well, what would you think if maybe we cut back on some of the tack music we play on the station?

02:46:04.580 --> 02:46:06.580
I collect your fucking head.

02:46:07.580 --> 02:46:09.580
Just like this fucker here.

02:46:11.580 --> 02:46:14.580
Oh my god, why did you do that to Loki?

02:46:14.580 --> 02:46:18.580
The holic thing on episode 69 was just a joke!

02:46:18.580 --> 02:46:21.580
Now if any of you sons of bitches

02:46:21.580 --> 02:46:23.580
got anything else to say,

02:46:23.580 --> 02:46:25.580
NOW'S THE FUCKING TIME!

02:46:53.580 --> 02:46:57.700
six maybe? I think so. Although that's still one of my favorites.

02:46:57.700 --> 02:47:01.500
You know that's based off an old banner I once saw on DDR Freak and I thought it was

02:47:01.500 --> 02:47:02.700
great. It had a photoshopped...

02:47:02.700 --> 02:47:05.940
It was somebody's signature banner and it said your post... or no, it was something

02:47:05.940 --> 02:47:09.640
that would post in a thread and it said your post makes Captain Jack cry

02:47:09.640 --> 02:47:13.260
and it was a photoshopped image of Captain Jack and his little

02:47:13.260 --> 02:47:16.620
like singer and their mouths were turned upside down

02:47:16.620 --> 02:47:20.660
so it looked like they were frowning and then tears were drawn on. It was so funny.

02:47:20.660 --> 02:47:22.540
I like the one that you made based on

02:47:22.540 --> 02:47:25.680
Dan's old joke with the one-hit wonder. Oh yeah.

02:47:25.680 --> 02:47:29.620
Oh yeah. Because you can sing one-hit wonder to the

02:47:29.620 --> 02:47:33.880
whole thing of Take On Me practically. And you know what? I will open it up to the

02:47:33.880 --> 02:47:37.040
listeners. The listeners have said, can we make promos for you guys?

02:47:37.040 --> 02:47:40.560
Sure! Why the hell not? Make us a promo.

02:47:40.560 --> 02:47:44.480
You could even sneak in your name in there somehow. I don't know.

02:47:44.480 --> 02:47:49.620
Be creative. We don't care. So we're gonna have an unofficial contest and the prize

02:47:49.620 --> 02:47:50.880
if you win the contest

02:47:50.880 --> 02:47:54.560
is you get your promo plate on the air. What? What?

02:47:54.560 --> 02:47:57.760
I will send, we will send you autographed

02:47:57.760 --> 02:48:01.200
of the EX-2 and

02:48:01.200 --> 02:48:04.560
the Max-2, whatever the word...

02:48:04.560 --> 02:48:07.560
The Ultramix-2 and the

02:48:07.560 --> 02:48:12.120
extreme V-rares? Yes. I will send you autographed copies.

02:48:12.120 --> 02:48:16.560
We will send you autographed copies. Alright, we will pick our favorites and we will send them autographed copies

02:48:16.560 --> 02:48:17.400
of the V-rares.

02:48:17.400 --> 02:48:23.400
By us. By us. And whoever else we can dig up. Maybe we can get some DDR Freak friends to sign them, too.

02:48:25.400 --> 02:48:32.400
Granted, it's not as good as the, um, Make Edit Get Porn contest, but it will have to do.

02:48:32.400 --> 02:48:38.400
Did we ever have a winner for that? We didn't even end up... Oh, yeah, that's right. That's right. I remember now. I remember that. That was a long time ago.

02:48:38.400 --> 02:48:43.400
What happened with that? For those who weren't listening back then, what happened with the Make Edit Get Porn contest?

02:48:43.400 --> 02:48:56.400
Well, we did have a winner. And the winner at the time was Dave. Those of you who have been listening to the show forever might remember Dave, how he used to come on and listen in the studio with us.

02:48:56.400 --> 02:48:57.400
How he used to race me home.

02:48:57.400 --> 02:49:03.400
Him and Paul. But, you know, they do not, for some reason, come over anymore.

02:49:03.400 --> 02:49:04.400
We're not cool anymore.

02:49:04.400 --> 02:49:12.400
We're not cool anymore. So, they're probably out screwing girls now, basically. They discovered girls.

02:49:12.400 --> 02:49:14.400
if you're ready to hit or something.

02:49:42.400 --> 02:49:53.440
almost porn, but you know, it's enough. Oh, how I miss the days. Alright. Anyway, free

02:49:53.440 --> 02:50:05.480
porn! Let's get into the DDR chit-chat post of the week. That's right, when we get bored

02:50:05.480 --> 02:50:10.280
on this show and we're desperate for materials, we turn to our buddies over on DDR Freak to

02:50:10.280 --> 02:50:14.760
to provide us with the inspiration we need to keep this show going.

02:50:14.760 --> 02:50:19.400
And we pick a post from DDR Chit Chat and make it our post of the week.

02:50:19.400 --> 02:50:23.920
Now, it was very tempting to use this as the post of the week, which

02:50:23.920 --> 02:50:28.440
actually was suggested to us by Flair O'Nai, which had the subject,

02:50:28.440 --> 02:50:31.480
does this girl worth risking?

02:50:31.480 --> 02:50:35.280
Hi, several months ago, I have signed erotic teen site.

02:50:35.280 --> 02:50:39.160
I have asked owner of this site, and he gave me mail one of the models.

02:50:39.160 --> 02:50:43.600
Her name is Julia, and here her free page.

02:50:43.600 --> 02:50:47.400
How do you think it is possible to have long relation with such models?

02:50:47.400 --> 02:50:52.440
Is it safe to go Ukraine now for meeting?

02:50:52.440 --> 02:50:53.440
But I thought...

02:50:53.440 --> 02:50:59.740
That sounds amazing when you like the Henry Rollins bit about the guy from Hungary.

02:50:59.740 --> 02:51:03.340
You know the problem I have with that post, besides the fact that it doesn't make any

02:51:03.340 --> 02:51:12.180
fucking sense, is that we have to have a little bit of a discussion on the post of the week,

02:51:12.180 --> 02:51:15.900
so that does not work for the post of the week, I apologize.

02:51:15.900 --> 02:51:21.380
Now this was actually, I can't fault this post for wording or grammar or anything, it's

02:51:21.380 --> 02:51:27.060
actually a pretty interesting post, I gotta ask the folks in chat, or the folks not only

02:51:27.060 --> 02:51:30.740
in chat, but the folks in the studio what they think about this one.

02:51:30.740 --> 02:51:34.940
This is a post and it's titled, Middle Finger Usage.

02:51:34.940 --> 02:51:39.540
We've all seen people make use of their middle finger in pictures of their DDR accomplishments.

02:51:39.540 --> 02:51:43.940
What's the significance of this?

02:51:43.940 --> 02:51:47.140
Does it symbolize hate for the song?

02:51:47.140 --> 02:51:50.460
Does it mean the accomplishment was hard to do?

02:51:50.460 --> 02:51:53.860
Are they full of rage and don't know where to let it out?

02:51:53.860 --> 02:51:56.180
Is it the in thing to do?

02:51:56.180 --> 02:51:58.060
If so, why did it become this way?

02:51:58.060 --> 02:52:01.660
Do they want to look like rebels, and are they succeeding?

02:52:01.660 --> 02:52:04.800
Are they conformists who don't even know the significance?

02:52:04.800 --> 02:52:10.820
I suspect a combination of the last three, but I don't really know.

02:52:10.820 --> 02:52:14.180
It's telling the song, I fucked your mom, and that's it.

02:52:14.180 --> 02:52:15.180
That's what it is.

02:52:15.180 --> 02:52:20.060
More or less, you know, it's like, ha, I fucked your mom, and I triple-aged you.

02:52:20.060 --> 02:52:21.060
The end.

02:52:21.060 --> 02:52:23.940
Is that where the expression, I triple-aged your mom, comes from?

02:52:23.940 --> 02:52:24.940
Because I've heard that.

02:52:24.940 --> 02:52:27.860
I've read that expression a lot on some of the message boards, and I always read that

02:52:27.860 --> 02:52:33.100
and go, God, you're 14. To be honest, I'm just totally guessing. I have no fucking clue

02:52:33.100 --> 02:52:39.220
why. I think it's because kids are stupid. I mean, because maybe flashing your penis

02:52:39.220 --> 02:52:45.420
is illegal. So, you know, flipping off the camera is like, look at me, I'm hardcore and

02:52:45.420 --> 02:52:48.940
I'm rebellious. I don't know.

02:52:48.940 --> 02:52:52.860
Jamie, are there any pictures of you on the Internet giving the middle finger on a DDR

02:52:52.860 --> 02:52:53.860
machine?

02:52:53.860 --> 02:52:55.740
Um, there have been, actually.

02:52:55.740 --> 02:52:57.940
Why were you given the finger?

02:52:57.940 --> 02:53:01.480
I think I was pissed off at the song.

02:53:01.480 --> 02:53:02.820
It's just a song?

02:53:02.820 --> 02:53:04.720
What did the song do to you?

02:53:04.720 --> 02:53:05.720
It fizzled.

02:53:05.720 --> 02:53:09.140
Fucked her mother.

02:53:09.140 --> 02:53:11.220
Did the song AAA your mom?

02:53:11.220 --> 02:53:14.020
Back in the day, possibly, but not currently.

02:53:14.020 --> 02:53:18.020
Her husband would take exception to that.

02:53:18.020 --> 02:53:19.020
Bugged?

02:53:19.020 --> 02:53:22.340
Now you've given the middle finger to several DDR machines, right?

02:53:22.340 --> 02:53:23.340
Sure why not?

02:53:23.340 --> 02:53:25.720
I could go do that right now.

02:53:25.720 --> 02:53:29.240
But are you just giving the middle finger to the DDR machine because you're like, fucking

02:53:29.240 --> 02:53:30.240
losers or what?

02:53:30.240 --> 02:53:34.360
No, it's because I can't get my zipper down at the same time.

02:53:34.360 --> 02:53:38.240
You're supposed to laugh, dammit.

02:53:38.240 --> 02:53:40.440
Here's a quote from the chat room.

02:53:40.440 --> 02:53:43.260
Wow, that's a really good question.

02:53:43.260 --> 02:53:47.320
And Illusion says, I'm only going to say this because I know Illusion happens to live in

02:53:47.320 --> 02:53:50.120
this same area, so I guess he's including himself.

02:53:50.120 --> 02:53:53.560
Illusion says, all those SoCal people always flip off the camera.

02:53:53.560 --> 02:53:58.400
They look like such dipshits.

02:53:58.400 --> 02:54:00.360
I don't know.

02:54:00.360 --> 02:54:01.360
I don't know why.

02:54:01.360 --> 02:54:04.760
I mean, I flip off the cameras and I flip off the webcam all the time.

02:54:04.760 --> 02:54:05.760
It's just...

02:54:05.760 --> 02:54:10.480
I have a picture of me flipping off people wearing a cast, and then I had the cast cut

02:54:10.480 --> 02:54:13.080
off with hedge-cutters.

02:54:13.080 --> 02:54:16.580
That was one of the few pictures that you posted on Oregon's radio, wasn't it?

02:54:16.580 --> 02:54:20.520
You know, when I flip you guys off on the webcam...

02:54:20.520 --> 02:54:22.000
It's a symbol of love.

02:54:22.000 --> 02:54:23.000
It is.

02:54:23.000 --> 02:54:26.500
symbol of love because what I really fucking love you well what is the word

02:54:26.500 --> 02:54:31.240
fuck really mean though it means I want to make love to you so when I flip you

02:54:31.240 --> 02:54:34.760
guys off on the webcam I'm saying I want to make love to you and when they flip

02:54:34.760 --> 02:54:38.560
you off when they're playing DDR they're really saying I want to make sweet sweet

02:54:38.560 --> 02:54:44.080
love to that song I just played that's not the way I always understand it

02:54:44.080 --> 02:54:48.840
especially when there's a lot of cursing that doesn't go with the love you know

02:54:48.840 --> 02:54:56.440
I've triple A'd that song and I'd like to make sweet sweet love to your mom or something,

02:54:56.440 --> 02:54:58.540
I don't know.

02:54:58.540 --> 02:55:02.900
Maybe Loki just does it because he heard freeze pop over the intercom when the picture was

02:55:02.900 --> 02:55:03.900
taken.

02:55:03.900 --> 02:55:04.900
What now?

02:55:04.900 --> 02:55:05.900
To my best!

02:55:05.900 --> 02:55:06.900
I completely missed that.

02:55:06.900 --> 02:55:07.900
Yes, yes you did.

02:55:07.900 --> 02:55:08.900
It's funny.

02:55:08.900 --> 02:55:17.860
I'm sure it wasn't, but that's okay.

02:55:17.860 --> 02:55:19.240
And we have a question from the chat room.

02:55:19.240 --> 02:55:22.140
Flair O'Nai says, you want to make love to me, Sky?

02:55:22.140 --> 02:55:24.300
In reality, yes, I want to make love to all of you.

02:55:24.300 --> 02:55:25.720
And there's a good reason for that,

02:55:25.720 --> 02:55:29.100
because you guys are what have made this station so damn great.

02:55:29.100 --> 02:55:32.060
And for that, I just want to make love to all of you.

02:55:32.060 --> 02:55:34.060
For those of you guys that are in the chat room

02:55:34.060 --> 02:55:37.580
and support this show, hey, DDR Angel's running away right now.

02:55:37.580 --> 02:55:38.780
Why are you doing that?

02:55:38.780 --> 02:55:42.100
I didn't mean now, just someday.

02:55:42.100 --> 02:55:44.580
In the metaphorical sense, that doesn't mean I actually

02:55:44.580 --> 02:55:45.700
want to take your clothes.

02:55:45.700 --> 02:55:47.420
In the metaphorical sense.

02:55:47.420 --> 02:55:51.420
You know what I'm saying? Jamie, don't you want to make love to all our listeners in the metaphorical sense?

02:55:51.420 --> 02:55:53.420
Hell no!

02:55:53.420 --> 02:55:59.420
Do you know where some of those people have been? Some have been with your mother!

02:55:59.420 --> 02:56:03.420
Do we have any, like, hot Asian, big-breasted chicks listening? Because...

02:56:03.420 --> 02:56:04.420
I am.

02:56:04.420 --> 02:56:06.420
Otherwise, you know.

02:56:06.420 --> 02:56:10.420
I am, and you can't prove that I'm not.

02:56:10.420 --> 02:56:18.420
Yeah, I think I can. But anyways, um, cause I know it's mostly adolescent guys, and I'm not into that, so.

02:56:22.420 --> 02:56:35.420
We need to be hitting up our big breasted Asian demographic, god dammit. Cause this is what we're, like, really hurting on, is the big breasted female Asian demographic. You know, age range of, you know, 21 to 28.

02:56:35.420 --> 02:56:41.420
Well, maybe you need to think of a show that would cater to the big breasted Asian women. Think about this one.

02:56:41.420 --> 02:56:44.420
Big booby chicks.

02:56:44.420 --> 02:56:48.420
That'd be a BBC show.

02:56:48.420 --> 02:56:58.420
Well, I could think of a couple ideas for a show. However, they would be very inappropriate for the radio.

02:56:58.420 --> 02:57:00.420
Like this isn't?

02:57:00.420 --> 02:57:07.260
Well, I'm trying to back away from, you know, making, you know, excessive amounts of racial

02:57:07.260 --> 02:57:08.780
stereotypes and...

02:57:08.780 --> 02:57:11.660
Other people have an idea, ask G4 how they did it.

02:57:11.660 --> 02:57:16.860
Now Rai-Chan and Joyce are sitting there in the chat room and they're saying, I've got

02:57:16.860 --> 02:57:19.620
the hot, hot Asian over here.

02:57:19.620 --> 02:57:24.300
And now they're claiming that there's no, they said, if you don't require big breasts,

02:57:24.300 --> 02:57:25.980
but I'm thinking the breasts are just fine.

02:57:25.980 --> 02:57:28.620
I'm thinking that they're just being a little self-deprecating.

02:57:28.620 --> 02:57:34.020
two women over there listening. Hey, that's two out of, you know, whatever. That's a good

02:57:34.020 --> 02:57:44.020
percentage. It's more than one. Yes, Darth Zagre. I'm not commenting. You know what?

02:57:44.020 --> 02:57:49.100
Wise. Very wise. If we have the big boobied Asian women show, we can certainly have the

02:57:49.100 --> 02:57:59.900
pantsless rage show. That's fine. The what? Old joke. You need to, Loki, you seriously

02:57:59.900 --> 02:58:11.060
need to register a site. Just bigbreastedasianchicksonddr.com. Quick, hold his credit card. Maybe our webmaster

02:58:11.060 --> 02:58:17.260
can help us make that happen. You know, it's only like, what, nine dollars or something

02:58:17.260 --> 02:58:21.620
the register domain name. It's really fucking cheap. I'll just have it point to, you know,

02:58:21.620 --> 02:58:33.140
Loki Fusion, so. Anyway, now Rychan and Joyce are arguing about their boobies. I don't know,

02:58:33.140 --> 02:58:36.880
maybe we'll get them on the Skype line another week. Sorry guys, but we do have to bring

02:58:36.880 --> 02:58:40.780
this show to a close. We're getting towards it. Yes, Loki. I mean, not saying that I'm

02:58:40.780 --> 02:58:45.740
hating against, you know, the Asians with smaller breasts. I mean, that's all good.

02:58:45.740 --> 02:58:49.060
you mean? You can't hate on it. Like they say,

02:58:49.060 --> 02:58:52.060
any more than a handful is a waste. So...

02:58:52.060 --> 02:58:56.060
Or is that a mouthful? I can't remember. I think it's a mouthful.

02:58:56.060 --> 02:59:03.500
Yes. And we're getting a post to our website here. It says www.bigbreastedasians.com

02:59:03.500 --> 02:59:07.140
I'm sure that site already exists, people. I'm sure it does.

02:59:07.140 --> 02:59:10.340
Here's the catch though. Big Breasted Asians

02:59:10.340 --> 02:59:14.580
playing DDR is the catch.

02:59:14.580 --> 02:59:18.540
Oh it doesn't... Bigbreastedasians.com doesn't exist?

02:59:18.540 --> 02:59:22.660
Wow.

02:59:22.660 --> 02:59:28.660
We need to register Big Breasted Asians and have it point to Orange Lounge Radio.

02:59:28.660 --> 02:59:35.660
Big Breasted Asian Women Playing DDR.com certainly doesn't have that.

02:59:35.660 --> 02:59:39.500
Alright.

02:59:39.500 --> 02:59:48.500
Loki's gonna work on that. I can't believe Big Breasted Asians isn't registered. Somebody can get us that for Christmas and have it point to Orange Lounge Radio.

02:59:48.500 --> 03:00:03.500
Seriously, I will point that to Orange Lounge Radio if I can do that. It's only a few bucks. I mean, I could do that. That'd be funny.

03:00:03.500 --> 03:00:10.360
Oh, actually, Jason says BigBreastedAsians.com does exist.

03:00:10.360 --> 03:00:11.360
He checked.

03:00:11.360 --> 03:00:14.360
I just checked and it wasn't there.

03:00:14.360 --> 03:00:15.360
It may be registered.

03:00:15.360 --> 03:00:17.560
It may be registered with no website.

03:00:17.560 --> 03:00:20.400
That's probably it then.

03:00:20.400 --> 03:00:22.280
Alright.

03:00:22.280 --> 03:00:27.000
I would have a hard time believing that BigBreastedAsians.com wouldn't exist.

03:00:27.000 --> 03:00:32.040
Now maybe there could be like BigTittied Asians or BigJugged Asians or well, you know what,

03:00:32.040 --> 03:00:36.640
We really need to end this show at this point, I'm thinking.

03:00:36.640 --> 03:00:40.640
In order to do that, we have to go around and get everybody's final thought.

03:00:40.640 --> 03:00:42.560
Bud, your final thought.

03:00:42.560 --> 03:00:43.560
Puppy bowl.

03:00:43.560 --> 03:00:46.920
DDR Angel, your final thought.

03:00:46.920 --> 03:00:52.240
Um, I don't have one, sorry.

03:00:52.240 --> 03:00:56.420
Dark sa- or, actually, Loki, your final thought.

03:00:56.420 --> 03:01:01.320
I hope that battery doesn't explode when I'm done charging it and plug it into the monitor,

03:01:01.320 --> 03:01:05.320
So it's like I've had really bad luck with batteries.

03:01:05.320 --> 03:01:07.400
Lick it first.

03:01:07.400 --> 03:01:10.800
My final thought is you better take that shit outside when you plug it in the first time

03:01:10.800 --> 03:01:12.840
in case you start any fires.

03:01:12.840 --> 03:01:14.040
DarkSakura, your final thought.

03:01:14.040 --> 03:01:20.520
Japanese games that have intros in German are awesome.

03:01:20.520 --> 03:01:24.280
Tonight's final word, I'm going to give the final word of the show tonight to DDR Angel

03:01:24.280 --> 03:01:28.720
because she hasn't said shit tonight, so she needs to get at least one word in.

03:01:28.720 --> 03:01:30.560
And thank you guys very much for listening.

03:01:30.560 --> 03:01:33.680

03:01:46.940 --> 03:01:47.940

03:01:48.940 --> 03:01:49.940

03:02:13.280 --> 03:02:17.280
Hi, I'm Cornolio. I need TV for my bunghole.

03:02:17.280 --> 03:02:19.280
Screw you!

03:02:19.280 --> 03:02:21.280
Do not make my bunghole angry.

03:02:21.280 --> 03:02:23.280
Do you have any olio?

03:02:23.280 --> 03:02:29.600
Ah, and, Gunterbud, Lord of the Mountains, behold my Patrick Duffy leg!

03:02:29.600 --> 03:02:30.720
Are you threatening me?

03:02:30.720 --> 03:02:32.320
Go home, you little dildo!

03:02:32.320 --> 03:02:33.680
You will give me TV!

03:02:33.680 --> 03:02:34.640
Bongoglio?

03:02:34.640 --> 03:02:36.240
Kick him in the nads, Beavis.

03:02:36.240 --> 03:02:36.720
Aye.

03:02:36.720 --> 03:02:38.240
Does not your scrotum need kicking?

03:02:41.120 --> 03:02:43.120
Oh my God! They killed Kenny!

03:02:43.760 --> 03:02:45.120
You bastard!

03:02:45.120 --> 03:02:46.960
You piece of crap! I'll kill you!

03:02:46.960 --> 03:03:05.320
Thank you very much for listening, and we'll see you next week.

03:03:16.960 --> 03:03:34.480
Another night gone here at the Orange Lounge Studio.

03:03:34.480 --> 03:03:36.640
Another work week about ready to start.

03:03:36.640 --> 03:03:39.000
Another school week about ready to start.

03:03:39.000 --> 03:03:40.000
Sadness.

03:03:40.000 --> 03:03:41.000
What?

03:03:41.000 --> 03:03:43.000
What, Angel?

03:03:43.000 --> 03:03:50.880
I just whispered the death the death game and he didn't even say anything because I

03:03:50.880 --> 03:03:58.720
