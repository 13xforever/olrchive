00:57.360 --> 01:02.880
Sakura. Yeah, that's a good description. Has the fan mail perked you up at all? You

01:02.880 --> 01:07.480
get more fan mail than any of us. You know what? Wait, did you see that? She just

01:07.480 --> 01:12.720
perked up like all of a sudden she's full of life. She's like, yay! Fan mail. Well, I

01:12.720 --> 01:19.380
have this sort of complex about myself where I'm like, eh, that's nice but I

01:19.380 --> 01:21.260
I don't deserve it, you know?

01:21.260 --> 01:22.180
You do, though.

01:22.180 --> 01:23.940
You're a good guy.

01:23.940 --> 01:26.380
I can't be the diva all the time.

01:26.380 --> 01:28.340
I have to be modest on occasion.

01:28.340 --> 01:29.780
Maybe I want to be the diva, dammit.

01:29.780 --> 01:30.620
Somebody send me a family.

01:30.620 --> 01:31.620
You can't be the diva.

01:33.220 --> 01:34.060
Oh, girl.

01:34.060 --> 01:35.420
There could be only one.

01:35.420 --> 01:36.740
There could be only one diva.

01:36.740 --> 01:38.860
I'm going to be the diva just tonight.

01:38.860 --> 01:40.740
I'm kind of, ugh.

01:40.740 --> 01:41.560
All right.

01:41.560 --> 01:43.020
How's the new Harry Potter book going for you?

01:43.020 --> 01:44.180
I'm about halfway through it right now.

01:44.180 --> 01:46.860
Dang, dang, you people read that book very fast.

01:46.860 --> 01:48.260
I haven't had a whole bunch of time to read it.

01:48.260 --> 01:51.140
This is only actually the equivalent of four hours reading.

01:51.140 --> 01:52.140
Wow.

01:52.140 --> 01:55.340
So which Harry Potter book does he go through puberty?

01:55.340 --> 01:57.780
He's already been going through puberty.

01:57.780 --> 02:00.640
He is in very much angsty teenager mode the whole time.

02:00.640 --> 02:03.780
He's angry at everybody with hormones.

02:03.780 --> 02:08.200
With the slowest they've been making the movies, pretty soon it's going to end up like Beverly

02:08.200 --> 02:11.700
Hills 90210 where by the time the sixth or seventh movie rolls around and Harry Potter

02:11.700 --> 02:15.160
is supposed to be in high school, that kid's going to be like 30.

02:15.160 --> 02:20.580
they've actually been aging physically in good accordance because they were

02:20.580 --> 02:24.060
going through the whole voice change thing in the third one it was cute all

02:24.060 --> 02:26.260
right let me try to relate this to games a little bit have you ever played the

02:26.260 --> 02:30.020
Harry Potter games yes I have what do you think of them crap all of them the

02:30.020 --> 02:34.500
only one I played which one did you like it one second one I played the kiddich

02:34.500 --> 02:38.860
game thought it would it's whatever kiddich quidditch I thought it was kind

02:38.860 --> 02:42.100
of crap but I played one where Harry was just kind of walking around I think it

02:42.100 --> 02:46.900
was Azkaban I don't remember but it was kind of cool it's okay I kind of like

02:46.900 --> 02:51.900
exploring the all the places and doing the stuff I just wish it would be cool

02:51.900 --> 02:56.180
it'd be like an MMORPG for the Harry Potter you know it'll happen you know

02:56.180 --> 03:01.200
it'll I will be on that so fast we're gonna talk about another MMO potential

03:01.200 --> 03:07.700
for lots of fanboys and girls tonight on the show all right well what you're

03:07.700 --> 03:11.780
think in the Oregon Trail thing. Oregon Trail, the MMORPG.

03:11.780 --> 03:16.860
It's a reference to our three-hour show earlier this evening. Which you should all be listening to as well.

03:16.860 --> 03:20.220
One of our callers brought up Oregon Trail, the MMO, should be a great idea.

03:20.220 --> 03:22.900
We're going to start an online petition and everything, so we'll see.

03:22.900 --> 03:27.420

Alright, let's get into the games. Let's talk about

03:55.860 --> 03:59.500
more specifically the games we've been playing this week. And who am I?

03:59.500 --> 04:02.660
Oh that's right, I'm here. Yeah, we did not

04:02.660 --> 04:09.360
Do Loki's intro? Yes, I did it. I said Loki and Dark Sakura. I'm not really away. Don't make me roll back the day

04:09.360 --> 04:14.140
Are you drunk again? I'm not drunk. You act you actually got a fan mail this week cuz you know, you were drunk

04:14.140 --> 04:16.860
I don't get fan mail. I get spam mail

04:17.380 --> 04:19.380
All right. Anyway, anyways

04:19.580 --> 04:21.580
What games you've been playing this week Dark Sakura?

04:22.260 --> 04:25.340
Hardly any I played PSO once. Mm-hmm and

04:25.340 --> 04:28.220
and that's really about it.

04:28.220 --> 04:33.180
Oh no, I put Guitar Man today on my 50-inch widescreen HDTV.

04:33.180 --> 04:38.420
It was like my entire range of vision was Guitar Man, and I suck at that game.

04:38.420 --> 04:41.940
The power power level kicked my ass,

04:41.940 --> 04:44.780
and it's only the second level.

04:44.780 --> 04:48.420
Guitar Man is a very strange music game. It's very different. The analog, like,

04:48.420 --> 04:52.300
in Guitar Man, of course, you're trying to play the guitar, and there's this one point where you move the analog stick

04:52.300 --> 04:54.820
very carefully, and you try to trace the pattern.

04:54.820 --> 04:58.900
it's kinda it's harder than you think yeah at least I for me but maybe I just

04:58.900 --> 05:02.620
I think it's my first time actually playing the game and I've owned it for

05:02.620 --> 05:03.540
two years

05:03.540 --> 05:07.940
mmm wow I unwrapped it last year

05:07.940 --> 05:10.940
alright Loki what kind of games you been playing this week? I've been working on

05:10.940 --> 05:11.780
Killer7

05:11.780 --> 05:16.060
made through the second level finally on third level and it just keeps getting stranger

05:16.060 --> 05:21.020
and yeah it's pretty much that and then on PSP I've been playing a lot of

05:21.020 --> 05:22.780
inboard games I've got the

05:22.780 --> 05:26.220
Namco battle collection I've been testing out, which has been pretty cool.

05:26.220 --> 05:30.380
Definitely got all your retro favorites in there, plus the remade ones are

05:30.380 --> 05:31.000
really nice.

05:31.000 --> 05:34.140
Like the remade ones from the early nineties, because like Pac-Man and

05:34.140 --> 05:36.500
Rally-X and stuff, they had in the arcades, they were cool.

05:36.500 --> 05:41.260
No, these weren't in the arcades, these were made specifically for the PSP.

05:41.260 --> 05:44.700
They're really nice, they look pretty, and they play well, so that's good.

05:44.700 --> 05:48.200
I like retro upgrades. I always liked Mario loss levels.

05:48.200 --> 05:52.380
Well, I'm sorry, not just Mario loss levels, but that was a part of

05:52.380 --> 05:55.260
Mario All-Stars. Thank you.

05:55.260 --> 06:00.260
And then I've been playing this puzzle game, uh, Col-On, um, a lot, and it's just some weird...

06:00.260 --> 06:03.460
It's friggin' hard, it's just... but it's a lot of fun, and I've been...

06:03.460 --> 06:05.820
Please tell me it's not spelled just like colon.

06:05.820 --> 06:06.740
It's with a K.

06:06.740 --> 06:07.580
Oh, okay, good.

06:07.580 --> 06:09.540
K-O-L-L-O-N, okay.

06:09.540 --> 06:14.300
I've been playing Col-On, and it was pretty cool, and I've been trying that out and stuff.

06:14.300 --> 06:16.740
Wait, wait, so a puzzle game you like on PSP?

06:16.740 --> 06:19.340
Yeah, it's really a lot of puzzle games coming out.

06:19.340 --> 06:21.940
We got bashed on Mercury and Smart Bomb, so...

06:21.940 --> 06:29.180
Well, Mercury sucked and Smart Bomb was not even finished, you know, whatever, I mean,

06:29.180 --> 06:30.180
they just sucked.

06:30.180 --> 06:33.580
But anyways, I've been trying those and then playing a little bit of Coded Arms and stuff

06:33.580 --> 06:34.900
and it was pretty fun.

06:34.900 --> 06:39.800
So yeah, just trying out the PSP games and stuff, whatever I can get my hands on.

06:39.800 --> 06:42.500
Well go figure, while Loki's been playing PSP, I've been playing DS.

06:42.500 --> 06:44.880
I played two new DS games this week.

06:44.880 --> 06:49.340
First one I checked out was Puyo Puyo, the new DS version of Puyo Puyo, which it kind

06:49.340 --> 06:52.820
of did for those you guys have played Puyo Puyo before you might have played it

06:52.820 --> 06:58.740
and not even known it because it was called Sonic's or no Dr. Robotnik's Magic

06:58.740 --> 07:04.300
Bean Machine on Genesis and then on Super Nintendo it was Kirby's Avalanche

07:04.300 --> 07:07.620
whoo I remember Kirby's Avalanche it was both of them were just different

07:07.620 --> 07:11.140
versions of Puyo Puyo well they have this game now and it's original kind of

07:11.140 --> 07:15.740
Japanese anime form on the DS but they kind of changed the game a little bit

07:15.740 --> 07:19.940
They change some of the mechanics, like they put fat pieces in them, like pieces that would

07:19.940 --> 07:25.640
usually be like, think of super gems from Puzzle Fighter 2 that fall, like big red,

07:25.640 --> 07:30.220
they're like 2x2s, they're just like fat red pieces and stuff, you know, different colors.

07:30.220 --> 07:34.540
So they change some of the game mechanics and keep it a little bit fresh.

07:34.540 --> 07:38.580
Some of the rest of the game though is a little bit dorky, like they have the cut scenes where

07:38.580 --> 07:41.420
they're talking to each other and it's all anime style, so they're all like cute little

07:41.420 --> 07:46.820
girls talking like this except they talk very slow when they do their talking so

07:46.820 --> 07:50.540
you know you're like sitting waiting waiting and it's kind of like why is it

07:50.540 --> 07:53.340
in a lot of these games when they're talking to each other back and forth

07:53.340 --> 07:58.780
they don't talk normally they slow down their speech like they're reading it

07:58.780 --> 08:06.420
line by line why is that so I don't know but it's it I was kind of impressed just

08:06.420 --> 08:09.660
to see all that in a little teeny DS cartridge the fact that they even had

08:09.660 --> 08:14.620
voice acting in it so I guess it's a you know hope of what's to come type thing

08:14.620 --> 08:18.700
but you know Puyo Puyo it isn't about the cutscenes it's about the action of

08:18.700 --> 08:21.980
the game so for a puzzle game it's a lot of fun if you liked any of those games I

08:21.980 --> 08:25.140
previously mentioned like Kirby's Avalanche and stuff you will like this

08:25.140 --> 08:30.540
game also loving this the new DS games are starting to be eight player games

08:30.540 --> 08:34.700
off of one cartridge Bomberman, Meteos not necessarily eight players but four

08:34.700 --> 08:39.460
you know loving that so I'm very happy to report that Puyo Puyo does the

08:39.460 --> 08:44.340
multi-player off one cartridge as well, that's great. Also, another DS game I

08:44.340 --> 08:47.500
checked out this week was Kirby's Canvas Curse, which has actually been out for

08:47.500 --> 08:50.700
about a month now, but I got it for my birthday. Thank you, Loki. So I've actually

08:50.700 --> 08:54.540
been playing that, and I have to admit I didn't want to play this game at first

08:54.540 --> 08:58.060
because I had a bad feeling it was gonna be like Yoshi Touch and Go, which if you

08:58.060 --> 09:00.980
listen to earlier podcasts, I did not like Yoshi Touch and Go. I thought it was

09:00.980 --> 09:05.300
way too generic, like it felt unfinished, like it was like there was only two

09:05.300 --> 09:08.460
stages in the game or something. I didn't care for Yoshi Touch and Go, but I'm

09:08.460 --> 09:14.220
I'm proud to report, Kirby's Canvas Curse takes a lot of those kind of concepts in Yoshi

09:14.220 --> 09:17.640
Touch and Go, even though the games were probably being developed around the same time, a lot

09:17.640 --> 09:21.460
of those concepts in Yoshi's Touch and Go are brought into Kirby's Canvas Curse and

09:21.460 --> 09:23.380
it's done much better.

09:23.380 --> 09:27.500
So if you actually liked Yoshi's Touch and Go, I didn't, but if you did, you will like

09:27.500 --> 09:32.760
Kirby's Canvas Curse because there's way more interactivity and there's so many different

09:32.760 --> 09:34.780
levels and things to unlock.

09:34.780 --> 09:37.780
And if you're a Kirby fan, you're going to like it because it has the old music and the

09:37.780 --> 09:42.020
cute graphics. But please note, this does not play like a normal Kirby game. That's

09:42.020 --> 09:46.220
one thing you want to keep in mind. It's Kirby Canvas Curse, and basically Kirby sort of

09:46.220 --> 09:50.660
moves automatically, and you can touch him with a stylus to make him roll faster, or

09:50.660 --> 09:55.000
if he's killed an enemy, you can use the power. Like if you hit one of the stone guys, then

09:55.000 --> 09:59.740
tapping on Kirby will make him turn into a stone. But it doesn't function like the other

09:59.740 --> 10:03.060
ones. You don't suck in the enemies using your breath like you did in the old Kirby

10:03.060 --> 10:07.760
games, it doesn't quite have that same gameplay element. The gameplay is much

10:07.760 --> 10:11.480
different because you're drawing paths for Kirby to take, which I know sounds

10:11.480 --> 10:15.520
very simple, but it's actually kind of complicated and the level design is

10:15.520 --> 10:19.620
pretty smart in the game. So I guess that's kind of my review. If you like

10:19.620 --> 10:23.640
Kirby the character, you'll like this game. If you like Kirby the actual game,

10:23.640 --> 10:28.640
you may want to rent or borrow this one first to make sure that the mechanics of

10:28.640 --> 10:31.600
the game are gonna be something you enjoy. But if you liked Touch and Go,

10:31.600 --> 10:35.300
you're gonna like this one. So that's my thought on Kirby Campus Curse. I forgot to mention

10:35.300 --> 10:39.620
I also played one more game called- What's that? Glow Race Fantastic Carnival? It's some

10:39.620 --> 10:46.220
racing game that's in Korea for the PSP. I don't like it. It was lame. I'm sorry to hear

10:46.220 --> 10:50.300
that. It's like a cheap version of Mario Kart that's not even close to being Mario Kart

10:50.300 --> 10:54.580
and just lame. I can't wait for Mario Kart DS though. Oh yeah. You know Mario Kart DS

10:54.580 --> 10:57.700
and Animal Crossing DS are gonna have the online thing. At least that's what they're

10:57.700 --> 11:01.220
saying right now. Yeah I hope so. I can't wait for that. Well you know it's gonna happen.

11:01.220 --> 11:06.140
showing it off at E3. But what's interesting is that OneUp.com ran a story this week about

11:06.140 --> 11:12.260
Metroid Prime Hunters not having the online capability and just kind of, why didn't, you

11:12.260 --> 11:15.460
know, because this game's been delayed and delayed over and over again, why didn't they

11:15.460 --> 11:19.740
bother to add in the online capability? Because think about it, Metroid Prime Hunters have

11:19.740 --> 11:24.540
been a lot of fun online. And there's some quotes in the articles here. The producer

11:24.540 --> 11:28.860
of the game, Kensuke Tanabe, says, really, we could have made this game online, but Nintendo's

11:28.860 --> 11:32.900
version of online play is different from that of other companies we wanted it to

11:32.900 --> 11:36.780
be free easy and easy to access for everybody to set up the kind of

11:36.780 --> 11:39.980
infrastructure that we needed and to meet the launch date we have for this

11:39.980 --> 11:45.180
game the two just didn't match and that makes me think what was the launch date

11:45.180 --> 11:49.020
for this game because dang it's been like a year since the DS came out well

11:49.020 --> 11:52.380
okay maybe not quite that life feels like a year in reality it's probably

11:52.380 --> 11:57.080
been what eight months or so since DS came out and prime hunters was the

11:57.080 --> 12:00.560
built-in demo and I would think that the built-in demo would be the game that

12:00.560 --> 12:03.880
would be coming out within like the first three months so unless there was

12:03.880 --> 12:08.440
just one hell of a teaser that's what it basically ended up being and of course

12:08.440 --> 12:12.640
then they kind of you know try to soften the blow here about Metroid Prime

12:12.640 --> 12:16.800
Hunters not being online Richard Verotti game designer over at Nintendo says I

12:16.800 --> 12:20.480
don't think we look at it as a negative thing because we're not focusing on the

12:20.480 --> 12:24.120
internet we got to focus on the Wi-Fi stuff so four players can jump in like

12:24.120 --> 12:27.700
that and if only one person has the game well you can download it too and then

12:27.700 --> 12:30.580
play with your friends I think it's gonna be the perfect multiplayer game

12:30.580 --> 12:34.820
because of that and I'll give them points for that I do like the fact on

12:34.820 --> 12:38.420
the DS you really get to sample a lot of games because it seems to be this

12:38.420 --> 12:41.520
running trend in a lot of games where you can play off of one cartridge and

12:41.520 --> 12:45.720
that at least is cool but the internet thing would have been cool I would have

12:45.720 --> 12:48.740
liked to play some of our podcast listeners on the internet but yeah I

12:48.740 --> 12:54.420
I lost my Metroid Prime Hunters demo. So I don't know where it is. I know exactly where mine is. It's

12:55.220 --> 12:59.100
The demo is fun, but I want the full game, you know, and what's weird? I didn't really like it

12:59.100 --> 13:04.500
I you know what? I don't like the 3d metroids on GameCube personally, like I did not get into them

13:04.500 --> 13:08.040
I love old-school Metroid Super Metroid. I think is one of the greatest games ever made

13:08.040 --> 13:11.460
I'm still gonna have to send you the Metroid maker. Oh like make your own

13:11.460 --> 13:17.440
Oh, you gotta send this someone had done a map editor for Metroid and someone has actually made a Metroid game out of a ROM hack

13:17.440 --> 13:22.520
thing so yeah that's cool um I love super I did not get into the three to

13:22.520 --> 13:27.320
eight three two three three D metroids as much but I love the the DS one I

13:27.320 --> 13:31.160
actually for some reason that the 3d thing works for me on that I don't know

13:31.160 --> 13:34.360
why it doesn't look nearly as good as it does on GameCube but for some reason I

13:34.360 --> 13:39.800
like it I don't I don't know what it is go figure all right so what do you guys

13:39.800 --> 13:44.480
think online play on DS something that more games should be looking at doing or

13:44.480 --> 13:49.780
let's let's see how these early ones do first before we start going let's get

13:49.780 --> 13:54.500
more online play because if it's gonna suck then no all right we got a couple

13:54.500 --> 13:59.600
letters tonight sent to us via to go at orange lounge radio.com that's to go at

13:59.600 --> 14:02.980
orange lounge radio.com so I thought we'd read a couple letters unfortunately

14:02.980 --> 14:06.020
we get we're getting a lot of mail so we don't have time to answer everything but

14:06.020 --> 14:10.460
dark Sakura she does check that mailbox and yeah I'd reply to my mailbox bill

14:10.460 --> 14:12.460
All I'm getting is spam!

14:12.460 --> 14:15.460
Do you need breast enhancement?

14:15.460 --> 14:19.460
Apparently I do, because there's a lot of people sending me that info.

14:19.460 --> 14:22.460
I still like that one webcomic you linked me to, Rob.

14:22.460 --> 14:24.460
The Spamusement. That's hilarious.

14:24.460 --> 14:29.460
I love Spamusement. Seriously, I think it's the best webcomic out there.

14:29.460 --> 14:33.460
And it's so simple. Spamusement.com gets my full endorsement. I love that site.

14:33.460 --> 14:35.460
Alright, let's open up the mailbag.

14:35.460 --> 14:45.500
Let's see, we got a fan letter here. I'm going to read the Loki fan letter here. This was

14:45.500 --> 14:50.660
from Same. Same says he was catching up on some of the old podcasts while cleaning up

14:50.660 --> 14:54.820
around my room and I was listening to the July 4th podcast and I must say the following

14:54.820 --> 15:00.220
words. I loved it. I am so serious. Loki was hilarious and I couldn't stop laughing every

15:00.220 --> 15:07.220
time he spoke. Do it some more. Seriously guys, that game was awful. Seriously. It was

15:10.380 --> 15:15.620
really awful. Seriously, it was awful. Look, um, Loki, next time he drinks, he's gonna

15:15.620 --> 15:20.180
be under strict monitoring when he drinks. He barfed on the carpet! It was disgusting!

15:20.180 --> 15:25.380
I had 20 shots of vodka! I mean, what do you expect? You need to be babysat next time you

15:25.380 --> 15:29.840
I thought it was a single shot glue drink responsibly boys and girls

15:30.480 --> 15:32.440
I didn't even think about it

15:32.440 --> 15:36.000
Alright, let's get to another letter here. This one is from

15:36.520 --> 15:41.140
Does this person have a handle? I couldn't see it in here. Sorry if you had a handle and I missed it

15:41.320 --> 15:46.440
This is from Brett and Brett wants to know I played Silent Hill 1 & 2

15:46.440 --> 15:49.680
I thought the second game was one of the best games available at the time

15:49.680 --> 15:54.200
I absolutely love Silent Hill 2 and then Silent Hill 3 popped its ugly head

15:54.200 --> 15:59.600
I wasn't feeling the 17 year old life vesting wearing chick and the game was a bit boring to me

15:59.600 --> 16:04.440
I think I played about two hours of it. My question is Silent Hill 4. Is it worth checking out?

16:04.440 --> 16:07.600
I know that the movie is coming out soon. It's been a hot topic on the show

16:07.720 --> 16:11.680
So Silent Hill 4 is the only one of the series. I haven't played yet. Should I give it a whirl?

16:12.000 --> 16:15.080
That's from Brett. What do you guys think those you guys definitely?

16:15.880 --> 16:19.720
Definitely you think so it's pretty good. What do you think dark Sakura? Have you played?

16:19.880 --> 16:23.560
We've had my copy of Silent Hill 4. I hope you've played it. Well, I have my own copy

16:23.560 --> 16:25.280
I thought I gave you yours back.

16:25.280 --> 16:26.280
I don't know.

16:26.280 --> 16:28.280
Well, I'll find it sometime when I unpack.

16:28.280 --> 16:29.280
Alright, that's cool.

16:29.280 --> 16:30.280
What do you think, though?

16:30.280 --> 16:31.280
Would you recommend Silent Hill 4?

16:31.280 --> 16:32.280
Well, yeah.

16:32.280 --> 16:33.280
You know, Silent...

16:33.280 --> 16:39.480
First of all, in my response that I had given back, I would say I told him to try Silent

16:39.480 --> 16:44.680
Hill 3 all the way through, because it really does get a lot better, but Silent Hill 4 is

16:44.680 --> 16:50.520
definitely from a male perspective, and it's very, I think, unique to the series.

16:50.520 --> 16:52.920
Very cool.

16:52.920 --> 16:57.000
I would definitely recommend Silent Hill 4. I, to be honest, I haven't even really

16:57.000 --> 16:58.760
played Silent Hill 3.

16:58.760 --> 17:02.120
So, but... I'm liking it. I really like Silent Hill 3.

17:02.120 --> 17:05.920
Silent Hill 4 is a continuation of the story from Silent Hill 2.

17:05.920 --> 17:09.040
So, I don't see how it could really be amiss.

17:09.040 --> 17:12.240
I love the soundtrack, especially. The soundtrack, I think, is one of the best

17:12.240 --> 17:12.960
parts

17:12.960 --> 17:16.400
of the whole game. That's what I love about it. So,

17:16.400 --> 17:20.560
at least rent it. Do yourself a favor, rent it. I think the idea of renting

17:20.560 --> 17:23.920
games is really great so definitely check that out.

17:23.920 --> 17:30.320
Alright and then one other letter we got from Mark and Mark actually lives in the UK and

17:30.320 --> 17:35.200
sent us a really great email, so great, but it was kind of long so I can't read the whole

17:35.200 --> 17:39.160
thing but it's a follow up to last week's podcast, remember how we were talking about

17:39.160 --> 17:44.280
the rating system and I said that they should do it like they do the movies.

17:44.280 --> 17:49.600
Well in here Mark writes, well this is how it's done in the UK to an extent, game ratings

17:49.600 --> 17:56.260
Ratings in most of Europe are given out by the Pan-European Gaming Information with ratings

17:56.260 --> 18:01.820
including 3+, 7+, 12, 16, and 18 printed on the boxes for each game, and often also accompanied

18:01.820 --> 18:05.980
by icons to describe the reasons for this rating.

18:05.980 --> 18:10.100
Although I don't believe the ratings are legally binding, retailers do tend to enforce the

18:10.100 --> 18:11.980
16 and 18 ratings.

18:11.980 --> 18:15.980
Also, most retailers will not stock a game without a PEGI rating, although again I don't

18:15.980 --> 18:21.140
think there's a legal requirement for them to do so.

18:21.140 --> 18:25.780
And then went on to say, the ratings tend to be quite effective as the 15 and 18 ratings

18:25.780 --> 18:30.760
have been used on movies for a very long time, so parents recognize the logos and understand

18:30.760 --> 18:32.940
the reasons for these ratings.

18:32.940 --> 18:37.680
Although Vinny linked us to an article that said that maybe the studies don't quite link

18:37.680 --> 18:38.680
up to that.

18:38.680 --> 18:42.620
And then they were talking about, Mark was talking about the hysteria, regarding hysteria

18:42.620 --> 18:47.900
about violent games in the UK. A notable recent case involved a boy, 14, getting murdered

18:47.900 --> 18:53.840
by an older teenager. It was reported that the older teenager had been inspired to kill

18:53.840 --> 18:59.440
the younger child by the game Manhunt. So that was kind of a whole big thing going on

18:59.440 --> 19:05.160
over there. Very interesting to hear the UK perspective. And then Mark ends his letter

19:05.160 --> 19:10.040
by saying, maybe everyone would be more mellow if Katamari Damacy ever came out over here.

19:10.040 --> 19:12.000
And I didn't even realize that game wasn't out over there.

19:12.000 --> 19:16.560
Neither did I. You need that game. You guys need that game. Import that stuff or something.

19:16.560 --> 19:19.040
Well, I don't think they can because of the television difference, but...

19:19.040 --> 19:23.600
Hey, you know what? A lot of TVs come out now able to switch between PAL and NTSC.

19:23.600 --> 19:26.560
Figure out a way to do it. You guys need that game. You're right. People would mellow out if

19:26.560 --> 19:28.800
they could play some Katamari Damacy. Play it on a computer monitor.

19:29.360 --> 19:33.520
Very cool. No problem on a computer monitor. All right. Thank you very much, Mark, for your

19:34.080 --> 19:38.720
mail. It was very nice. I like it in the long mails. It really shows they listen to us. It's

19:38.720 --> 19:42.600
great alright so we're gonna close up the mailbag again if you guys have an

19:42.600 --> 19:48.200
email to go at orange launch radio dot-com are the PlayStation 2 version of

19:48.200 --> 19:52.760
Grand Theft Auto San Andreas it was confirmed by GameSpot that it does have

19:52.760 --> 19:56.760
the hot coffee content so that's interesting because as we were saying

19:56.760 --> 20:02.160
last week you have to mod your game to do this but apparently the sequence of

20:02.160 --> 20:05.540
codes have been discovered or something that will actually unlock this in the

20:05.540 --> 20:10.460
PlayStation 2 version of the game which kind of goes well well now is this a

20:10.460 --> 20:14.860
case of Rockstar was just lazy and didn't take the code out apparently it

20:14.860 --> 20:19.940
could be like you know the code pointing to it or whatever could be like you know

20:19.940 --> 20:25.180
truncated out or something like that I just put one code in there to patch you

20:25.180 --> 20:29.700
know the rewrite the code I mean I don't see how they're guilty for having this

20:29.700 --> 20:32.820
code in there if it's disabled I mean there's a lot of things that can be

20:32.820 --> 20:36.820
disabled in a game but that's not part of the game it's not what you're playing

20:36.820 --> 20:39.380
because now this issue is just snowballing it's training bigger there

20:39.380 --> 20:42.740
were reports earlier this week that now Hillary Clinton is on board against all

20:42.740 --> 20:47.860
this oh come on she needs him something you know the bitch about but I I think

20:47.860 --> 20:52.180
you know I I'm not gonna dog Hillary Clinton or whatever because I think well

20:52.180 --> 20:56.420
I will blame because I think a lot of people in this case are being a little

20:56.420 --> 21:00.500
bit ignorant and I can't say I blame them 100% because not everybody's a

21:00.500 --> 21:03.200
gamer and I don't think there's any senators that are video gamers although

21:03.200 --> 21:05.780
if there are that would be cool and I would vote for them. She probably thinks

21:05.780 --> 21:09.900
that you know Bill Clinton slept with Monica. Now wait a minute. Because

21:09.900 --> 21:14.560
he saw the whores in you know Grand Theft Auto. Wait a minute. There's nothing

21:14.560 --> 21:21.700
to do with it. Does it? I think people are thinking that this is actually in the

21:21.700 --> 21:27.240
game and was like something hidden by the people who coded it as some type of

21:27.240 --> 21:31.420
of, like, secret feature, but that really doesn't seem to be the case when you look

21:31.420 --> 21:32.420
into it.

21:32.420 --> 21:33.420
Oh, but do they do the research?

21:33.420 --> 21:34.420
No!

21:34.420 --> 21:35.420
Well, that's the problem.

21:35.420 --> 21:37.340
I think that's why this whole thing is blown out of proportion.

21:37.340 --> 21:40.940
I don't think people have been doing the appropriate research, and I'm hoping that that is the

21:40.940 --> 21:44.260
investigation they're going to do, and that's what they're going to find out, because what

21:44.260 --> 21:50.980
they want to find out, did Rockstar release this game knowing that they were marketing

21:50.980 --> 21:55.920
this as a mature game when it should have been adults only because this would be unlocked

21:55.920 --> 21:56.920
by somebody?

21:56.920 --> 22:01.840
some hacker went and figured out a way to do it and Rockstar was under the

22:01.840 --> 22:04.560
impression that that wouldn't happen because they had removed the code that

22:04.560 --> 22:12.000
points to the hot coffee mug. And did they, I don't know, investigate why

22:12.000 --> 22:16.040
Janet Jackson's boob popped out? No, they did not. Instead, they pointed fingers.

22:16.040 --> 22:19.240
That's the whole reason. They're not going to investigate it because

22:19.240 --> 22:23.200
why? Because they have this bias against the game industry anyways and this is

22:23.200 --> 22:27.420
just more fuel to their fire that's it you know they're just they they want to

22:27.420 --> 22:32.300
see everything censored and everything you know hunky-dory Christian so what I

22:32.300 --> 22:36.140
don't understand this is something you know if you think about it M would be

22:36.140 --> 22:39.820
like an R rating on a movie right because a o would be like the NC 17

22:39.820 --> 22:43.420
rating right and they want to say that this hot coffee mod should earn this

22:43.420 --> 22:47.660
game and adults only rating but my god have you seen sex scenes and how many are

22:47.660 --> 22:51.020
rated movies I mean should that really qualify this game for an a o rating

22:51.020 --> 22:55.460
granted I'm maybe I myself being a leader here because I have not seen the

22:55.460 --> 22:59.420
mod myself but I'm assuming how bad can it be it's pixelated for God's sake how

22:59.420 --> 23:00.420
bad can it be

23:00.420 --> 23:05.340
you know I don't well it is pretty graphic but it's not

23:05.340 --> 23:09.700
the grant to graphic to the point where I'd say it be either money shots

23:09.700 --> 23:12.940
no that there just pixelated movies

23:12.940 --> 23:16.100
but still still look at look at God war

23:16.100 --> 23:19.540
there's a sex minigame in that game and I mean

23:19.540 --> 23:24.980
And there's boobies that are not pixelated, they're out there saying hello, and he basically

23:24.980 --> 23:28.860
says, you know, hey, thanks for the screw, get off my fucking boat, you know, that's

23:28.860 --> 23:29.860
basically...

23:29.860 --> 23:31.900
And that game was an M-rated game, right?

23:31.900 --> 23:32.900
Yes it was.

23:32.900 --> 23:33.900
An M-rated game.

23:33.900 --> 23:34.900
Not AO.

23:34.900 --> 23:35.900
Not AO.

23:35.900 --> 23:36.900
Interesting.

23:36.900 --> 23:41.380
It's because there's like, penetration in it or something, you know.

23:41.380 --> 23:43.060
Who knows?

23:43.060 --> 23:46.180
Anybody that's learned about the birds and the bees knows that when we're talking about

23:46.180 --> 23:48.460
sex, penetration's involved.

23:48.460 --> 23:52.980
on there's a freaking dildo weapon in this game I mean do we do you can

23:52.980 --> 23:57.940
actually put in a code to get an army of whores with dildos and vibrators running

23:57.940 --> 24:02.480
behind you while you're in a gimp costume I mean come on this game is you

24:02.480 --> 24:06.900
know it's meant to be this way people are reading way too much in this is you

24:06.900 --> 24:09.220
know what's gonna happen people are gonna see that hot coffee mutt they're

24:09.220 --> 24:13.020
gonna go rape people that's what's gonna happen because you know Grand Theft Auto

24:13.020 --> 24:16.740
causes people to murder each other because you know it's just subliminal

24:16.740 --> 24:21.100
messaging because we we have no control if if we see TV do it we've got to go do

24:21.100 --> 24:24.760
it it's an impulse well bottom line and I think we can all agree on this kids

24:24.760 --> 24:28.380
shouldn't be playing Grand Theft Auto why are you buying your kids Grand Theft

24:28.380 --> 24:32.260
Auto honestly I walked in the game spot just last week and I watched a parent

24:32.260 --> 24:35.580
let her kid who couldn't have been older than 12 by Grand Theft Auto and I'm just

24:35.580 --> 24:42.140
thinking okay I realize that there's very mature 14 15 16 year olds out there

24:42.140 --> 24:45.220
that can probably handle it I know 14 year olds that are more mature than some

24:45.220 --> 24:48.980
32 year old I know I think contract because when you're buying this for the

24:48.980 --> 24:52.660
fucking people make them sign a contract if it's their parents buying for him say

24:52.660 --> 24:58.100
I understand what is in this game and I understand it oh and then that way if

24:58.100 --> 25:01.060
their son goes and murder somebody and they blame it on grant the thought but

25:01.060 --> 25:05.140
no no no no no because you understood what you were getting into so that's

25:05.140 --> 25:13.180
your own damn fault bad parent bad all right I'm sure we'll get some emails on

25:13.180 --> 25:17.260
that one let's go to a happy family-friendly story shall we will talk

25:17.260 --> 25:21.480
about worms a nice game about worms oh wait these worms have guns and blow each

25:21.480 --> 25:24.600
other up I guess this isn't so family-friendly I like worms but worms is

25:24.600 --> 25:28.720
coming to the PSP and DS I liked worms when it was called scorched earth and it

25:28.720 --> 25:33.480
was out on the PC like 10 years 15 years ago by the way it's up scorched earth is

25:33.480 --> 25:37.940
actually being ported to the PSP already has that's awesome

25:37.940 --> 25:42.620
thq today announced that it'll publish two new worms games for the DS and the

25:42.620 --> 25:47.900
PSP. No release date set yet, but is it really any surprise that Worms is coming

25:47.900 --> 25:49.800
out on the DS and the PSP? Probably not.

25:49.800 --> 25:54.920
I don't know, but THQ, I want my five dollars back because the cell phone game version of

25:54.920 --> 25:59.060
Worms sucked ass.

25:59.060 --> 26:03.480
I thought this was interesting. Sega, it is rumored that their new arcade board

26:03.480 --> 26:06.680
is actually based on the Xbox 360. I heard that.

26:06.680 --> 26:10.220
The distributors in Japan are saying that the Lindbergh system, which is Sega's new

26:10.220 --> 26:15.680
system their new arcade board it does use the 360 architecture very interesting

26:15.680 --> 26:20.120
and this by the way would be the second time that a Microsoft console has been

26:20.120 --> 26:25.220
the inspiration for a Sega arcade cabinet the Chihiro board was based on

26:25.220 --> 26:29.200
the current Xbox you mean it's not the third time that that's happened since

26:29.200 --> 26:33.560
there's only been I don't know two systems so this logically can only be

26:33.560 --> 26:38.400
the second time just just reporting just reporting what's on the internet out

26:38.400 --> 26:41.600
there okay dark soccer you're Sega fangirl what do you think of this one

26:41.600 --> 26:44.940
Sega teaming up with well not necessarily teaming up with Microsoft

26:44.940 --> 26:50.580
but certainly using a lot of their stuff as long as they're using them and not

26:50.580 --> 26:54.740
climbing into bed with them I'm happy you know it makes sense though because look

26:54.740 --> 26:59.240
at them like for instance I saw an article on project Gotham Racing 3 near

26:59.240 --> 27:03.880
photorealistic imagery that's in that game I mean it's just amazing just the

27:03.880 --> 27:07.160
quality graphics that can be pushed out by the sport more power to them if they

27:07.160 --> 27:09.740
want to make an arcade game like that wait a minute did I just hear you say

27:09.740 --> 27:15.680
something nice about the Xbox yes about the Xbox 360 can somebody please note

27:15.680 --> 27:20.860
the date and time this is a miracle the 360 I still dislike the fact that it's

27:20.860 --> 27:23.900
you know that one of the selling points is custom faceplates because that's

27:23.900 --> 27:29.540
retarded but you know whatever hey it's that it's aimed at that same market that

27:29.540 --> 27:33.900
watches pimp my ride what can I say speaking of the s box 360 I have one

27:33.900 --> 27:39.020
more quick story on this. Marvel said this week, and this is of course at the Comic-Con

27:39.020 --> 27:45.020
convention they unveiled this, they have an exclusive agreement with Microsoft to produce

27:45.020 --> 27:51.100
MMORPGs that will be on the Xbox 360. So you can expect to see like Spider-Man and all

27:51.100 --> 28:00.100
that stuff, MMORPGs, Fantastic Four also, X-Men, Iron Man, only on Xbox 360 and MMORPG4.

28:00.100 --> 28:03.280
Yeah, it's going to be a Marvel Universe MMO.

28:03.280 --> 28:08.280
This is no surprise because they actually filed lawsuits against people that did, what

28:08.280 --> 28:09.280
was it?

28:09.280 --> 28:14.160
The Superhero City of Heroes because of their character generator people were using to create

28:14.160 --> 28:19.720
likenesses of characters that look very similar to this and they said that that would cause,

28:19.720 --> 28:24.620
that would kind of put a dent in the being able to create an MMO featuring Marvel characters.

28:24.620 --> 28:29.240
So we knew this was coming, but yeah, I mean DC is doing theirs, so why not?

28:29.240 --> 28:35.120
Sony Online is working with DC, that was announced earlier, so that's just kind of interesting.

28:35.120 --> 28:38.100
You know, that's kind of what I thought when I first heard this, I was like, don't we already

28:38.100 --> 28:42.760
have a game called City of Heroes?

28:42.760 --> 28:46.840
But in City of Heroes, it's more about creating your own thing, and with the Marvel games,

28:46.840 --> 28:50.680
it's about playing characters that, well, assumably, you're going to play as characters

28:50.680 --> 28:53.320
or interact with characters that you know and love.

28:53.320 --> 28:57.640
You know, a lot of people love Fantastic Four, Spider-Man, just absolute fandoms out there

28:57.640 --> 28:59.200
for this, so this game is going to appease them.

28:59.200 --> 29:03.560
Are they going to kill off all the main characters like they did for the Matrix game?

29:03.560 --> 29:04.560
What?

29:04.560 --> 29:05.560
Oh, nothing.

29:05.560 --> 29:06.560
I'm sorry.

29:06.560 --> 29:07.560
Alright.

29:07.560 --> 29:08.560
Um.

29:08.560 --> 29:12.720
By the way, follow up to your lawsuit there, NCSoft had a little bit of a victory there

29:12.720 --> 29:16.120
because the judge threw out a lot of Marvel's complaints, just so you know.

29:16.120 --> 29:17.120
Eh.

29:17.120 --> 29:18.120
Alright.

29:18.120 --> 29:19.120
Alright, moving on.

29:19.120 --> 29:22.560
Loki, why don't you tell us what's going on in the hack and crack world?

29:22.560 --> 29:23.560
Lots of stuff.

29:23.560 --> 29:31.200
First off, PSP stuff, they have released the brand new loader for the PSP UMD rips.

29:31.200 --> 29:34.080
It's 2.5e or something like that.

29:34.080 --> 29:41.560
It allows most of the games to play with Wi-Fi and sound because I guess the PRX files, they're

29:41.560 --> 29:45.740
like these library files kind of like on Windows where you have DLL files.

29:45.740 --> 29:49.580
Library files are being loaded now so you can do Wi-Fi in a lot of games and you can

29:49.580 --> 29:52.940
also overclock the games as well, which was kind of neat.

29:52.940 --> 29:53.940
So that was one of the things.

29:53.940 --> 29:59.040
The other thing that came out which was really cool was the SCUMM VM PSP Beta.

29:59.040 --> 30:07.660
And for those who don't know, SCUMM stands for, what was it, it was, oh man, it's the

30:07.660 --> 30:14.060
programming language that they use to write games like Maniac Mansion and Monkey Island

30:14.060 --> 30:16.060
and those wonderful games, the LucasArts games.

30:16.060 --> 30:21.400
Anyway, so you can actually play these games now, you can put this file on there and play

30:21.400 --> 30:24.760
all your PC games. Those LucasArts games were awesome, like Loom and stuff. Yes, they are

30:24.760 --> 30:31.240
awesome, yes. So you can play those and that was really cool. Of course, also, the other

30:31.240 --> 30:39.240
thing that was really, that came out, they actually have brand new emulators and stuff.

30:39.240 --> 30:45.520
They have one for the Dreamcast VMUs, which is kind of interesting. The other thing, what

30:45.520 --> 30:53.320
that I put on there the other week. I don't know, just updates to all the brand new emulators

30:53.320 --> 30:58.200
and whatnot. So, you know, check out the updates, they're really cool. Just lots of cool stuff

30:58.200 --> 31:02.840
out there. Like I said before, you know, check out PSPupdates.com, you can find a lot of

31:02.840 --> 31:06.880
info on there. Just lots of cool games, especially since Scorched Earth is being ported over,

31:06.880 --> 31:16.240
that's really nice. We need ZZT. We need ZZT. Please, ZZT. Oh, one more thing. Oh, I forgot.

31:16.240 --> 31:22.920
Doom. They fixed Doom, so now it plays better and it has good sound. Sounds good. Lots of

31:22.920 --> 31:27.320
homebrew stuff on the PSP. It's just exploding. Alright, well we here at Orange Lounge Radio,

31:27.320 --> 31:30.960
we're not here to just talk about video games all the time, because if we played video games

31:30.960 --> 31:36.640
all the time, we'd have no time to go to the mall. So, we're here to better your life and

31:36.640 --> 31:41.960
In what way better to better your life than allow the one and only DarkSakura to present

31:41.960 --> 31:43.840
her advice column.

31:43.840 --> 31:46.480
So DarkSakura, what are you going to be giving us advice about tonight?

31:46.480 --> 31:52.680
Today's bit of advice is how to escape when tied up.

31:52.680 --> 31:54.840
Some people may not want to escape when tied up.

31:54.840 --> 31:55.840
Hey!

31:55.840 --> 31:58.280
We need to stay PG rated tonight.

31:58.280 --> 31:59.280
Sorry.

31:59.280 --> 32:00.480
Well, he already dropped the F bomb.

32:00.480 --> 32:03.160
Yeah, well fuck what he did, okay?

32:03.160 --> 32:05.160
Okay, sorry.

32:05.160 --> 32:10.280
Number one, when your captors start binding you, expand your body as much as possible.

32:10.280 --> 32:14.400
Take a deep breath, puff out your chest, and pull your shoulders back.

32:14.400 --> 32:19.680
Two, flex your arms against the bonds, push against the bonds as much as possible.

32:19.680 --> 32:24.080
Three, once your captors leave, suck in your chest and stomach, wiggle free with the extra

32:24.080 --> 32:25.360
room you have given yourself.

32:25.360 --> 32:27.800
But my final bit of advice...

32:27.800 --> 32:28.800
Yes?

32:28.800 --> 32:33.800
This bondage party is sick, man, sick.

32:33.800 --> 32:38.320
Alright. And with that, DarkSakura, you're...

32:38.320 --> 32:41.840
are you on your way out? Yes, I must.

32:41.840 --> 32:45.000
Alright. The man has the car today. I see. Alright.

32:45.000 --> 32:48.520
And I'd recommend you also don't try to get out of your bondages with a

32:48.520 --> 32:51.960
lighter because you might set fire to the whole Nazi castle

32:51.960 --> 32:55.600
like in, uh, Indiana Jones.

32:55.600 --> 33:00.800
Shut up. Alright. DarkSakura, your final thought, then, before you take off.

33:00.800 --> 33:03.720
Fuck your yaky blue jeans. I'm sorry. Reject false icons.

33:03.720 --> 33:05.720
Alright, bye DarkSakura!

33:05.720 --> 33:06.720
Bye!

33:06.720 --> 33:08.720
Have fun storming the castle!

33:08.720 --> 33:09.720
Okay, we're not done just yet.

33:09.720 --> 33:13.720
We have another couple quick stories for you guys, then we're gonna make it a wrap.

33:13.720 --> 33:15.720
PlayStation 3.

33:15.720 --> 33:19.720
You remember how PlayStation 3 was originally supposed to double as a router as well?

33:19.720 --> 33:20.720
It was?

33:20.720 --> 33:21.720
Yeah.

33:21.720 --> 33:23.720
It was originally gonna double as a router.

33:23.720 --> 33:25.720
Well kids, not anymore.

33:25.720 --> 33:26.720
It's no longer going to be a router.

33:26.720 --> 33:31.720
They have quietly dropped over at Sony the PlayStation 3 router functionality.

33:31.720 --> 33:35.720
and that was going to, of course, make your PlayStation 3 able to function as a router.

33:35.720 --> 33:39.720
Well, I can understand why they had it function as a router,

33:39.720 --> 33:42.720
because I was looking at the pictures of it and there's like three ethernet ports,

33:42.720 --> 33:44.720
and I'm like, what the hell is that for?

33:44.720 --> 33:47.720
There's like 5,000 ports on the back of a PlayStation 3.

33:47.720 --> 33:50.720
But ethernet ports, I'm like, what the hell do they need three ethernet ports for?

33:50.720 --> 33:53.720
I just didn't understand that, but whatever.

33:53.720 --> 33:56.720
Well, now you've got to wonder, are they even going to be the ethernet ports anymore

33:56.720 --> 33:57.720
if they're getting rid of the network?

33:57.720 --> 34:02.040
probably blank but so they're gonna remove functionality like you know will

34:02.040 --> 34:04.920
it not be able to play games pretty soon because they've removed the hard drive

34:04.920 --> 34:09.660
they remove you know this they remove what else I mean here's a hint Sony

34:09.660 --> 34:14.760
remove the boomerang your old controller was just fine seriously don't try to

34:14.760 --> 34:22.560
improve on something that's already good all right you know but the rumor is that

34:22.560 --> 34:26.920
the revolution is still gonna have this router capability with it that would be

34:26.920 --> 34:31.320
cool yeah I mean I don't I don't but but how well we'll see we'll see we

34:31.320 --> 34:34.800
speculate all we want I thought they were releasing their own like router or

34:34.800 --> 34:38.200
something no no no no we don't know until they start showing the goods

34:38.200 --> 34:45.040
rumors rumors until then last story tonight interesting report over on BMJ

34:45.040 --> 34:48.920
journals calm this is a site that's dedicated to light it's like a

34:48.920 --> 34:54.160
healthcare archive kind of has a lot of reports it's the general medical

34:54.160 --> 34:58.160
Journal website is what they call it on their main page. They had an article

34:58.160 --> 35:01.400
recently about video games and health so if you want to look at this up

35:01.400 --> 35:05.960
bmjjournals.com talking about how video games can be used in the treating of

35:05.960 --> 35:10.400
cancer patients which kind of makes you go well that's kind of weird you know

35:10.400 --> 35:13.920
you wouldn't think of that but sure enough they say in the report here one

35:13.920 --> 35:17.000
innovative application of video games in healthcare is their use in pain

35:17.000 --> 35:21.200
management. The degree of attention needed to play such a game can distract

35:21.200 --> 35:25.760
the player from the sensation of pain, a strategy that has been reported and evaluated amongst

35:25.760 --> 35:30.380
pediatric patients. One case study reported the use of a handheld video game to stop an

35:30.380 --> 35:34.140
eight-year-old boy from picking at his face. Because, you know, he had this disease that

35:34.140 --> 35:39.460
was causing him to want to, you know, pick at his face and stuff. So, just kind of interesting,

35:39.460 --> 35:43.240
video games taking your mind off of other things being used as actual medical treatment.

35:43.240 --> 35:47.620
So what a nice follow-up to have to the, you know, video games are evil story that we had

35:47.620 --> 35:52.180
earlier in the show. It sure beats the, you know, dog cone caller for it, like, you know,

35:52.180 --> 35:58.620
people are trying to pick their face. But I guess that's right. But, uh, yeah, I guess

35:58.620 --> 36:05.300
that's good. I mean, you know. Laura Croft fights cancer. Alright. Maybe that'll be the

36:05.300 --> 36:10.540
next Tomb Raider. Alright, kids, that's gonna do it. That's gonna do it for just don't even

36:10.540 --> 36:13.920
talk because you're gonna offend somebody. I know you're thinking and you're just gonna

36:13.920 --> 36:16.000
to offend somebody.

36:16.000 --> 36:19.100
All right, you know what?

36:19.100 --> 36:22.540
Just email Loki if you want to know the jokes, okay? Just email him.

36:22.540 --> 36:25.020
He'd like the attention.

36:25.020 --> 36:28.360
That's gonna do it for another episode of Orange Launch Radio To Go.

36:28.360 --> 36:31.320
Loki, your final thought.

36:31.320 --> 36:35.240
No, I gotta play some more games.

36:35.240 --> 36:36.720
I'm trying to... I gotta

36:36.720 --> 36:40.840
work on some Killer7 and hopefully they're gonna import ZZT over.

36:40.840 --> 36:45.800
Otherwise the next thing I gotta do is I gotta make some hacked ROMs and put them in my Nintendo

36:45.800 --> 36:46.800
emulator.

36:46.800 --> 36:51.440
Alright, and my final thought is, I'm gonna go play on my new HDTV, I'm gonna go play

36:51.440 --> 36:52.440
2DX widescreen.

36:52.440 --> 36:53.440
Woohoo!

36:53.440 --> 36:54.440
That's it!

36:54.440 --> 36:59.240
Alright, thanks for tuning in to us and subscribing to our podcast, we'll see you next week with

36:59.240 --> 37:01.560
more Orange Lounge Radio To Go.

37:01.560 --> 37:06.600
