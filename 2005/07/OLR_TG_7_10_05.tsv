442	3483	Orange Lounge Radio To Go Edition, week of July 11th, 2005.
3643	14045	You're tuned in to the Orange Lounge Radio To Go Edition, your podcast home for all the latest video game news and gamer chat.
14365	18186	Now, here are your hosts, DarkSakura, Sky, and Loki.
19246	21606	Hello, everybody, once again.
22227	29208	Welcome to the Orange Lounge Radio To Go Edition, that podcast dedicated to video games that don't suck.
30006	30687	The One and Only, Loki
58410	61192	Yes, I am here and I'm sober this time.
61292	62072	Yes, you are.
62152	63733	How are you feeling after last week's show?
63773	64314	I feel fine.
64474	69577	You know, after, really, you know, the next day I woke up, I did not remember the podcast.
69817	73659	I remember doing a podcast, but I didn't remember anything from the beginning to the end.
73980	77642	So I actually had to listen to the podcast to figure out what I said.
78240	79981	and what I said was basically a lot of rambling.
80361	86123	But when I wasn't repeating myself three times in a row, I was pretty... But you always ramble.
87263	87784	More so.
89124	89804	It was pretty bad.
90465	92045	You were very random and it was hilarious.
92085	93746	We got some concerned emails.
93786	96367	I want our listeners to know he's okay.
96487	96987	I'm okay.
97287	101649	What happened was I drank a little bit more than I thought I actually had been drinking.
102011	103192	Don't go the whole way, like Loki did.
129298	130278	Oh well, lessons learned.
130318	132359	It's a good thing you didn't end up going to the hospital, young man.
133439	136540	Seriously, I was thinking that you might have had, like, alcohol poisoning.
137481	139601	Well, he did to some extent, because that's what causes you to go bleh.
139621	142943	Well, yeah, but I mean... Anyway, let's move on to the games.
142963	143983	Like that chick on The Real World.
144923	146044	I don't watch crap.
146204	146484	Come on.
146504	148885	This is a long time ago, and I caught the first episode by accident.
149385	150345	I thought you didn't watch TV.
150365	151305	This is a shocker to me.
151786	152986	This was a long time ago.
153086	153686	Oh, okay, okay.
153766	154787	And MTV, nonetheless!
155047	155387	No, I know.
155487	155867	I understand.
156445	156705	DarkSakura
177702	180564	I've been playing Buy the Washer and Dryer and Refrigerator game.
181445	184127	You need to get a Game Boy or something to play.
184147	186909	I know you probably have a Game Boy, a WonderSwan.
186929	187829	They're in boxes!
188790	192273	But we did buy a 50-inch widescreen HDTV.
192533	192913	I remember.
192953	194474	You briefly touched on that last week.
194494	196295	This is sexy.
196516	197516	How do the games look on it?
197877	199298	We haven't hooked anything up yet.
199618	200599	They're in boxes!
200899	202160	Where are your priorities?
203000	206283	My priorities have been going to work...
207572	210455	and buying a washer and dryer so that I don't have dirty clothes.
210636	211336	Fine.
211356	216082	And a refrigerator so that I have food that doesn't go bad, that I can't eat any of.
217363	218024	Fine, fine.
218624	220086	Gamers gotta have priorities too.
220146	221768	Let's find out then what Loki's been up to.
221788	222549	What have you been up to, Loki?
222629	224071	I've been playing a lot of stuff, actually.
225152	228736	The first game I started off with this week was Mercury for the PSP.
229677	231720	and I'm happy to say it sucked ass.
231740	232681	Really?
233182	235405	And it was a complete disappointment.
235966	237668	It's not what you think.
237808	240332	It's a puzzle game, but I was bored.
240652	243216	It was just completely retarded and I was just...
243752	247074	Thank God, you know, I was borrowing it and not buying it.
247535	250016	That's two puzzlers now on PSP you haven't liked.
250156	251317	And it's the same thing.
251477	252718	Lots of load time also.
252938	254619	It's like, what the hell's wrong with these people?
254900	257021	But it sucks, so don't buy it.
258162	261344	Then I played Coded Arms for the PSP.
261844	264946	PSP's first first-person shooter, and it's awesome.
266067	266968	It's really awesome.
267408	272892	The controls, they tried to do the best they could at the PSP, being that it only has one analog stick, so the other
273444	278566	You know, looking around is used with the four buttons, which isn't quite good.
278906	281688	It's not as smooth as I would have liked it to have been.
282188	285309	But, you know, it's the best they can really do for the PSP.
285449	286430	So they made the best of it.
286470	288150	But other than that, it's okay.
288471	291332	I wish there was another analog stick on the PSP, then it would have been perfect.
291732	293913	What makes it so great, then, since you're only complaining about the controls?
293933	295053	Just the graphics are really good.
295134	296734	The game's just put together really well.
296894	299856	I was surprised on how well the graphics were.
300036	302617	It looks like a lot of fun, actually.
304597	309558	The other game I played was Puzzle Bobble for the PSP, which is a Japanese import.
309678	311499	Not telling you how I got that one.
312639	315740	Just like Puzzle Bobble, no surprise there.
316200	319460	It's every system's mandatory Puzzle Bobble release in one way or another.
319680	320080	It's good.
320621	324721	I know DarkSakura's going to yell at me for this, but a lot of you folks know it as Bust a Move.
326562	327922	Puzzle Bobble.
328342	332103	I'm just saying, the American name was Bust a Move despite how you feel about Bust a Groove.
332864	333444	and all that stuff.
333544	338127	Now, moving away from the handheld systems, I bought Killer7.
339067	339568	It's great.
339588	340928	It's just a very psychotic game.
341388	345271	The storyline, the game, it seems very anime-like to me.
346291	346851	What's the setup?
346951	350713	The setup basically is, I mean, they don't really tell you much in the beginning.
350853	352334	You're this group of assassins.
352394	357457	Basically, this guy, Harmon Smith, he's this wheelchair-bound assassin who has...
357864	358265	Thanks for watching!
371016	386029	There's, you know, you're not really sure if, you know, he's in the, if it's in the physical form or not, and what they make you, what they kind of lead you to believe is that you yourself, the player, are another one of his personalities, which is great.
386310	391194	So that was really neat, and it's just, the storyline's very rich and just like full of
392243	393785	I don't know, a lot of detail and stuff.
393825	396267	And I've only played, you know, to the second level so far.
396587	399449	And there's a lot of really crazy shit in there.
399510	401191	I mean, like, they're laughing.
401271	406676	The main villain or the enemies that you encounter are called these things called Heaven Smile.
406936	408117	And they look like these zombies.
408157	411980	And they have these giant, like, grins on them.
412020	413461	And they just go, ha, ha, ha.
413622	414262	And they laugh.
415163	416924	It's like a weird laugh.
417065	418085	And then they've got, like...
419444	425907	You shoot them and you collect the blood from them and you use the blood to... It's like that one game, Nano Breaker.
426167	426607	Sort of.
426948	427688	Oil, sorry.
428028	430189	Sort of, but this is actually blood.
430970	432070	It's really strange.
432290	433731	The whole game is very psychotic.
433751	434971	How's that graphical look?
435011	436892	It's good.
436912	438953	It's all cel-shaded, but it's done really well.
439233	442655	The cutscenes are in anime.
443075	444116	It's really interesting.
444516	446757	They give you a lot of background about the characters and stuff.
447168	449549	But the whole game, I still don't really know what's going on yet.
449589	451149	And that's the whole point.
451369	453190	You feel psychotic playing this game.
453270	454330	So do you recommend this one?
454370	454871	Oh, yeah.
455051	456171	It's a very different game.
456231	459532	It's got a storyline that's about as deep as Silent Hill.
459752	466054	And it plays, to me, I mean, everyone's knocking the rail system where you're running around limited movement.
466294	468715	But it plays, to me, sort of like Alone in the Dark.
468975	470736	There's puzzle solving and stuff like that.
471739	474042	Speaking of Silent Hill, since you brought it up, I have to put this in real fast.
474063	475825	I've been following what's going on with the movie.
476306	479210	They're putting Pyramid Head from Silent Hill 2 is going to be in the movie.
480592	481273	Get this.
482235	486361	And this is just going to let you know, oh my gosh, we might get a video game movie done right in every way.
487001	488783	and Akira Yamaoka is producing the soundtrack.
490044	490384	I know.
490524	492846	And Akira Yamaoka actually did the music for the Silent Hills.
493106	495188	So they're not violating that.
495268	500632	I'm like, I was going to have a problem with Silent Hill with Akira Yamaoka because half of Silent Hill is the mood of the music and everything.
500672	502353	So I'm just very excited for this movie now.
502593	504215	Oh, that's incredible.
504375	506877	The music and mood of this game is really weird too.
506997	510359	It's just, it's really, you've got to play Killer7.
510480	511580	At least rent it once.
511721	513782	It's just so strange.
513942	514883	It's just, you've got to play it.
515626	516927	Dear Yamaoka-san, I love you, I love you, I love you.
528624	531727	So, yeah.
531787	532988	We are not above groveling.
533048	533649	I'm sorry, Loki.
533749	539234	Other than that, I won a free PSP, and I ended up selling it for about $150.
540095	544859	But I sold it to someone that's in our company, and I'm also going to get the hookup from them.
544879	548002	They're going to give me a copy as soon as they get it of Advent Children.
548462	549363	Maybe a UMD.
549503	550424	Nice.
550544	550905	Okay.
551265	553647	So I had to knock the price down for them.
553667	553988	Okay.
554648	556969	So, but, uh, yeah, that's pretty much all I've been doing.
556989	559230	Killer7's awesome, and I'm gonna play all the way through it.
559270	561471	Destroy All Humans, I've already beat it, and it was fun.
561811	566494	How was, without giving away the ending, were you, I heard, I heard rumors that the ending was a bit of a letdown.
567354	569455	Eh, it's your typical ending for a game.
569595	572837	It wasn't like, I, there really, there's not high expectations.
572857	580020	The, the end of the game, you have, like, two boss fights, and that's kind of weird, because there's no boss fights throughout the whole game, and then you fight these two bosses, and it's like,
580720	586024	Okay, they're a little bit stronger than they should be, but this is retarded.
586524	592049	The whole point of the game is that you've got the same guy that does the voice acting for Zim, and he's in it, and it's great.
592109	592849	That's what I love about it.
592869	593129	Well, good.
593190	594410	Now that you're done with it, I can borrow it.
594511	595131	That's the important thing.
595671	597453	No, you can't, because you don't have a US PlayStation 2.
598274	599556	I will very soon.
599736	602640	I'm working on that because I'm sick of having only a Japanese one.
602680	612713	Although I'll tell you what, if I had a Japanese PlayStation, or if I had the drive, I do have a Japanese PlayStation 2, if I had the money to import, I would have imported We Heart Katamari this week.
613234	614294	It was released in Japan.
614434	615015	It's awesome.
615255	618136	I actually want to play little bits from the soundtrack for you guys.
618156	623678	Just little, little snippets because, you know, playing music in podcasts is, you know, I don't know, it's questionable.
623718	628880	But I don't think they'll mind the free plug if we just play a little snippet here from the soundtrack.
628920	631961	So what I want to play for you guys is a little snippet.
632381	633501	First off, you have to hear this.
634361	635002	This is great.
635042	638023	This is the training music in the new We Heart Katamari.
638323	639523	It's like beatboxing.
639563	641064	It's this Japanese beatbox guy.
641084	641504	Listen to this.
656677	657378	What do you expect?
657458	663523	It's the kind of thing you'd expect from the sequel to Katamari Damacy, so I'm not disappointed at all.
663543	665084	I love the game, just the premise of the game.
665204	668467	It's basically the Prince of the Cosmos or whatever.
669868	673351	He's doing stuff for the fans of the previous game.
673451	674612	That's the story of the game.
674632	675193	That's cute.
675353	675873	Here's another one.
675893	677795	This is a quick snippet from the introduction of the game.
685959	689182	Let's see Katamari Damacy, The Broadway Show
709437	710178	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
728277	728917	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
744989	760542	I'm sure the game is great if you're into that kind of thing because it's definitely a pretty looking game and a lot of the elements in it are very cool like they have like the voting with page up and down and just the aspect of it the setup is really good but honestly me personally I just couldn't get into it like it was seriously one of those things where I'm just like
761306	764188	I really want to like this game, but it's just not my thing.
764268	765629	I can't get into this.
766210	769852	My feeble brain cannot handle this game for some reason because I kept shooting my own guys.
770052	770773	I don't know.
770813	772594	I just didn't get it.
772674	777197	One more addition to the Killer7 thing, just to tell you how crazy it is.
777578	780180	You talk to a severed head a lot of times.
780200	781280	That has nothing to do with what I'm talking about.
781300	781661	You're done.
781701	782021	You're done.
783007	790257	But Battlefield 2, my only disappointment with it, I'm sure it's a fun game if you're into the games, and it would be a great party game.
791338	792500	I gotta try that still.
792540	799069	I'm not gonna give a final verdict on the game until I can really play it with some other live people, except I don't know who in their right mind would want to play that game with me because I'm awful at it.
799509	828125	but um my only disappointment is that I actually expected the graphics to be even was considering the system requirements for that game oh my gosh it's like you have to have a 1.7 gig machine and all this stuff crazy high-end video card um luckily I have a lot of that stuff but I would I was kind of expecting the game to look better maybe I just didn't get far enough in it though so I'm kind of I'm not gonna dog on it for the graphics I mean it is a nice looking game it's just I would have expected it to be the best darn thing I've ever seen considering the
829155	829956	technical requirements.
830236	832458	So that's my half-assed review of Battlefield 2.
832698	834159	Sorry, I tried for you guys.
834219	836221	I tried to play a War Sim game and get into it.
836581	837902	Just couldn't do it.
838362	842385	I'll stick with Techie.
843366	844046	What was that game?
844466	845968	I can't remember the English name of it now.
847389	850491	With the huge controller that I got Dan.
850962	853344	Oh, the MechWarrior?
853684	854165	Yeah.
854425	854986	MechAssault.
855446	858168	No, that controller didn't go to MechAssault.
858889	860851	It was Steel Battalion.
861331	862252	Oh, that's it.
862532	865094	I'll stick with Steel Battalion because it has an eject button.
865795	866716	The eject button was cool.
867516	869478	Dahlia Gillespie, Alessa Gillespie Officer Gucci
896755	903238	and someone named Sharon and a bunch of... The only actors in here I've really heard of is Sean Bean, which is pretty cool, because he can be wicked.
904739	906759	All right, so more to come on the Silent Hill movie as we get it.
906779	908240	Let's get into some other gaming news.
908620	910701	First off, I think this is very interesting.
911221	925548	The makers of Grand Theft Auto San Andreas, Rockstar Games, is being held under the microscope right now by the ESRB, and what this whole thing centers around is basically the sex mod, which some of you guys... I think we've talked about it on this show previously.
925568	925788	Yeah.
926648	930329	Loki, you're that hack crack guy, tell us about, set up this sex mod, how does this work?
930349	954533	Okay, basically there's unfinished code that's in the game, or basically locked out code, and, you know, people being, you know, the hackers that they are looking through the code, they found it, and so they enable it back in the game, much like how with Grand Theft Auto's, or not San Andreas, Vice City and stuff, they had, they're working on Multi Theft Auto, which is using the multiplayer code that was in there to, you know, play online.
954946	955667	Thank you for watching!
971484	973506	So yeah, that's what the whole fuss is about.
973826	976548	And apparently it is very graphic from the video that I've seen.
976588	977449	I haven't done that yet.
977469	980291	Wait, DarkSakura, you found a site with pictures and stuff?
980331	981792	What did you find out about this?
982192	983293	I actually closed it.
984894	988937	It just had three positions and showed pictures of them all.
990158	996363	But it also gave a link to the site how to get to said mod.
996403	997504	Give me a second, I'll get it up again.
997624	997764	Yeah.
998120	1002625	Basically, you can download it on the major Grand Theft Auto mod sites.
1003165	1006068	And it starts off, where are you going?
1006168	1007189	For coffee.
1007830	1012254	And then the woman orally pleasures you.
1012274	1013495	We get it, we get it, we get it.
1014456	1015317	It's very graphic.
1015437	1018841	It's like, hmm, well, yeah, that would be pushing the envelope there, wouldn't it?
1020502	1028249	Where I found the pictures was on ukresistance.co.uk for the June 2005 news.
1029850	1030450	Yeah, pictures there.
1031131	1035695	You know, and the ESRB is now kind of looking going, you know, should this be an adults only game?
1035715	1046004	Because the California Assemblyman Leland Yee is saying that this, basically he's kind of pushing behind this too, that the game should be rated adults only.
1046304	1047786	And the ESRB needs to take another look at this.
1047866	1048006	But
1048945	1070440	I what the ESRB has to look at is did Rockstar sneak this by were they intending this to be a part of the game and I say if you have had to mod or crack the game no it's not it's unfinished stuff it's just like how there was a skateboard weapon and people have unlocked the skateboard weapon it's code that was in there that's unfinished and they they took it out and it's the same thing
1071254	1083961	Like I brought up on our live show, there was Bloody War 3, all the little pictures hidden in the game, that if you put in the debug code by using a GameShark or Game Genie, lo and behold.
1083981	1092365	And as one of you guys brought up on the live show as well, the nude patch for the Sims, EA didn't get sued over that because that was something that was out of their control.
1092726	1093186	Exactly.
1093866	1094286	Exactly.
1094386	1099209	I mean, even though they accidentally left the code in the game, that doesn't mean that
1100195	1105557	They're violating the license agreement by doing that, right?
1105577	1110018	Or the gay sex ending for SimCopter What?
1110519	1114180	There was a gay sex ending for SimCopter How have I not heard of this?
1114540	1125804	This is a long time ago, I remember seeing something about this Well, SimCopter, the graphics weren't that great But it was a bunch of stick figures, guys, you know, having anal sex
1126408	1128570	And I kid you not, it was in the game.
1128650	1131412	It was an Easter egg that some developer hid in there.
1131432	1132953	And I was like, what the hell?
1133514	1134455	But it was in there.
1134655	1138097	In that context, the term Easter egg is like ten times funnier.
1138137	1138478	I'm sorry.
1139018	1139318	All right.
1140279	1140680	It's weird.
1140720	1140920	Okay.
1141200	1143902	Anyway, so quick poll.
1144022	1145764	Is anything going to happen to Rockstar because of this?
1145984	1146364	I say no.
1147665	1151768	The only thing that will happen is their game will sell more because people want to play it.
1151929	1154791	I want to play a game with simulated boobies.
1155510	1163036	As I also suggested on the live show earlier tonight, mirror the rating systems that the movies use.
1163137	1169342	I think it would be a good way for this rating system to become more socially acceptable because even though we as gamers know enough about this system,
1170259	1171020	I don't think parents do.
1171040	1172921	Stop letting your kids play these games.
1173161	1174262	Honestly, it's just mature.
1174782	1178524	They don't sell it to minors, so you're buying it for them.
1178784	1179745	Shame on you.
1180205	1180906	Why are you coming?
1181186	1184768	I didn't know it was going to be full of blood and violence and stuff.
1184828	1186869	Even though on the back it says, full of blood and violence.
1189371	1190992	This is interesting.
1191492	1192213	Another story now.
1192233	1193173	We're going to get into another story.
1193373	1199317	Xbox is going to be getting... You remember how Fable came out for the Xbox and then people were like, oh, it's good, but it's short.
1199693	1204194	So they released the version on the PC called The Lost Chapters, which is like a longer version of Fable.
1204434	1205015	Well, guess what?
1205275	1207495	Xbox is now getting Fable The Lost Chapters.
1208076	1210276	And when I read about this, I was like, damn it.
1210336	1212557	You know, I just spent $30 on Fable not that long ago.
1212837	1213257	And get this.
1213557	1215918	Fable The Lost Chapters is going to be a budget title, $20.
1216898	1219639	So people like me who just recently bought the game are SOL.
1220459	1221080	Thank you.
1222300	1222680	Jerks.
1224601	1226981	No, but that's good news for those folks that haven't played the game yet.
1227262	1228722	This will give them a good excuse to check it out.
1229875	1231356	How about we open up the old mailbag?
1231376	1234877	We got a lot of great letters from last week's show, so I think it's time we open up the mailbag.
1234897	1235717	You guys ready for this?
1236358	1236578	Ready.
1236898	1238379	All right, let's go into the mailbag.
1242420	1249643	First email came to us from Acer800, and Acer800 is a girl gamer and wanted to say this.
1249703	1253325	Your comments on girl gaming last week were pretty interesting and sadly true.
1253925	1255726	I've been playing games since I was a wee girl.
1255786	1258267	One of the first games I played was Mortal Kombat.
1258287	1258467	What?
1259485	1265726	I love fighting games and sport games and the feeling of how smug guys are shocked when I kick their butts at Soul Calibur 2.
1266755	1269697	DarkSakura, you're a great representation of a girl gamer.
1269717	1270037	You rock!
1270077	1270798	Aww, that warms my heart.
1296995	1300336	That's quite an achievement there to warm DarkSakura's cold little black heart.
1300576	1301156	I'm just kidding.
1302557	1303337	I got shot a look.
1303757	1304878	My heart's not black.
1305458	1311380	Now all you need to do, DarkSakura, is you need to lick a PSP so you can become famous like that one chick who did nothing.
1313081	1313461	Huh?
1314041	1314321	What?
1315041	1318042	The one that's on the red-ass baboon site or whatever.
1318082	1320003	The stupid girl gamer reviewer.
1320123	1320463	Forget it.
1320848	1324952	The one that's like a chauvinistic, or no, a feminist, yeah, I don't like her.
1325312	1330137	Look, the best thing I can say, I'm like, okay, whatever, you're on your own world there.
1330818	1335442	The best response I can give to that is, you go, girl.
1336083	1336583	You go, girl.
1338465	1338625	What?
1339751	1340672	Ego++ I love the boys too
1360314	1365157	We had an email from Rob, sent us an email, and Rob had a comment on the women gaming issue as well.
1365617	1373101	One huge way to get girls and women to actually like video gaming would be to stop putting out girl games, quote unquote, that stink.
1373562	1379785	It looks like a lot of girl games for preteens are created with entry level and inexperienced programmers to cut their teeth on.
1380306	1383848	This makes the preteens hate video games when they grow up, I imagine.
1385171	1386793	Interesting perspectives.
1387153	1389576	Stop putting out such amateurish pink games.
1389616	1390498	I call them the pink games.
1390658	1391999	Or Mary-Kate and Ashley games.
1392019	1396685	Buena Vista Interactive needs to stop putting out titles for the Game Boy Advance.
1397005	1399529	Like, for example, Lizzie McGuire.
1399909	1401010	That's a Raven 3.
1402672	1404455	Okay, and just like, you know...
1405724	1406565	Games like that.
1406585	1408407	They're platformers and just awful.
1408948	1409429	Stop.
1409629	1410410	You know what they need?
1410770	1414154	They need more puzzle games for the home consoles.
1414474	1415395	They need to hire me.
1415415	1415656	None.
1419966	1422307	They need to hire me to design games for them.
1423247	1427608	It's going to be chick with big gun shoots a bunch of idiots.
1427628	1428968	Wasn't that Tomb Raider?
1429508	1430128	No, no, no.
1430528	1432689	That's slut with big guns.
1432889	1433409	Sorry, sorry.
1435209	1437010	I don't want to spend too much more time on this topic.
1437170	1442191	The best thing about Tomb Raider was Tomb Raider 2 because you could do a little button press code and shit explode.
1443237	1444678	You could also go on her balcony.
1444698	1448602	You could shut the butler in the walk-in for a year and he wouldn't follow you anymore.
1449263	1451245	And then you could jump off the balcony and she'd break her neck.
1451705	1452646	If you do like a dive.
1454227	1454407	Wow.
1454848	1456850	That's why Tomb Raider 2 is the best of the series.
1457955	1461917	You know, I think more girls would like Final Fantasy X if they gave it a chance, you know?
1462277	1463478	Final Fantasy X?
1463518	1464878	That's a game everybody can like.
1464978	1465899	Okay, but think about it.
1466119	1467840	There are some... X-2.
1467920	1473782	Great... Well, X-2 is more like a girl power type game, but X... There's guys and girls who can agree.
1473823	1477764	I mean, the girls in that are great characters, and there's different types.
1477784	1482967	You know, you have your kind of slutty Riku, but Yuna's a strong woman, and Lulu's kind of the sassy one.
1483007	1485448	Yuna is just determined, but she's a...
1486389	1488213	Okay, I'm self-spoken.
1488353	1491499	Okay, I'm going to be a summoner and die.
1492762	1495728	Oh wait, this sucks and my man is... I don't want to spoil it.
1495748	1496830	Alright, alright, shh.
1497311	1497732	Let's get...
1498120	1498980	Let's get to another email.
1499000	1500821	This email came to us from Tom.
1501241	1502841	Tom W., thank you very much for the email.
1503961	1509243	Wants to let us know that we actually, last week we were talking about Bomberman and we said we couldn't think of one on the Genesis.
1509643	1514424	He wanted to let us know there actually was a Bomberman game on the Genesis, Mega Bomberman.
1514724	1516224	I actually have that somewhere.
1516424	1517104	And you forgot.
1517365	1519565	And I forgot because I have too damn many games.
1519605	1522986	Well, he also sent us a picture, so thank you very much for bringing back the memories there.
1523106	1524826	Dude, Mega Bomberman was pretty cool.
1524846	1526567	We make mistakes, what can we say?
1527107	1527487	Except me.
1528226	1528486	R. Love PS3
1544750	1553341	He basically says in his email here, the reality is that this is a way for Sony to get more money from people by nickel and diming consumers on peripherals.
1553641	1555443	This is one thing I hate about Sony.
1555724	1562192	They put out a hard drive with Final Fantasy XI bundled because they knew someone would buy it with the assumption that there would be content that uses it.
1563396	1564676	Can't say I disagree.
1564716	1566717	I think the nickel and diming is one way to look at it.
1566937	1569958	Why bundle it in when we can get you to charge more?
1569998	1571879	But all the game companies are doing it.
1571979	1572479	Take GameCube.
1572499	1575180	Nintendo is the most notorious.
1575200	1575540	Oh, yeah.
1575580	1575920	Nintendo.
1576280	1577401	Take the Xbox.
1577461	1577841	Hello.
1577921	1579181	The DVD playback kit.
1579321	1581682	If that wasn't nickel and diming you, I don't know what is.
1581942	1582362	You know what?
1582382	1584043	You want to play DVDs, you cunts.
1584363	1589825	Even back on the Dreamcast, they put out this broadband adapter that two games used.
1590825	1592746	They didn't even have it accessible on PSO.
1593832	1597474	So from my perspective, you have a point, but all the game companies are doing this.
1597534	1598395	It's not just Sony.
1598815	1604319	But the other part is that, that being said, a hard drive in PlayStation 3 would have been a bigger deal than it is.
1604719	1608141	That is because there would have been games and such that would support having it.
1608321	1614806	Xbox had that Blinks game, an in-game custom playlist on certain games which made a case, if not a small one, for having it.
1615126	1621410	I would love to believe that developers could dig up a bit more creativity if they realized more uses for an in-console hard drive.
1621550	1626452	Yeah, I know what rocked about the Xbox hard drive is modding it and putting games on it.
1626512	1627052	Woohoo!
1627132	1627472	Fun!
1629773	1634275	I don't disagree with what he's saying, though, because loading times could be reduced and things of that sort.
1634295	1635455	And he also talks about his email.
1635495	1636595	That's exactly why.
1637236	1639697	You know what my PlayStation 2 hard drive is for?
1640657	1641557	HD loader.
1641717	1645078	Yeah, I use it for shortening those load times.
1645479	1648420	Yeah, of games that I have owned.
1648940	1649300	I have.
1650257	1651298	Thanks for the emails, you guys.
1651338	1652479	We always love your perspectives.
1652739	1654621	If you have a comment, you can always email that to us.
1654721	1657823	Tugo at OrangeLoungeRadio.com is the address.
1658644	1660405	Let's look at some more gaming news going on.
1660525	1661606	Space Invaders.
1661966	1662987	You know Space Invaders.
1663047	1667771	According to the latest issue of Famitsu, Space Invaders is coming to the PSP.
1668691	1671193	And this will be released in Japan for $45.
1672374	1673355	And I can't help but think...
1675316	1677197	I can play it on my Atari for free.
1677717	1682278	It's a souped-up version of the classic, but from the screenshot I saw... With a trackball!
1682858	1684759	Well, you've got that little analog thing, I guess.
1685179	1689520	From the screenshot I saw, it just looked like a souped-up version of the original, but nothing to scream about.
1689800	1692061	But I'm thinking, $45 for Space Invaders?
1692081	1695982	Which, I'm sorry, in my opinion, Space Invaders is kind of one of those overrated classics.
1696522	1697963	Like, to me...
1698803	1701644	I don't know, give me a game like Galaxian, Jairus.
1701664	1703906	I think GORF for the same game was better.
1703926	1704566	GORF was awesome.
1705746	1707667	GORF was like three different games in one.
1707928	1709809	I'm not all about the Space Invaders.
1710029	1711629	Pac-Man Warship, I get that.
1711890	1713510	Space Invader Warship, not so much.
1713770	1718513	But admittedly, and before someone sends an email on this, I understand it was a huge deal in Japan.
1718533	1720274	It was a much bigger deal there than it was here even.
1721178	1721578	I can see that.
1721598	1726564	And this game is only announced for Japan at this time, so maybe it makes a little more sense to that.
1726624	1726884	I don't know.
1726924	1728366	But even the recent Pac-Man titles have all been budget.
1728386	1733991	I think the whole reason for cost, though, is, you know, it was the same reason why Nintendo 64 games were so expensive.
1734952	1738216	It was, uh, you know, they're, uh,
1739677	1740558	and more.
1755914	1756354	I don't know.
1756655	1759517	Atari did this.
1759557	1761519	They updated a bunch of their old games.
1761579	1762800	Pong was one of them.
1763821	1764702	Did they do Warlords?
1764742	1765682	I don't remember.
1765742	1767384	Frogger came out in here as well.
1768124	1770967	How many Frogger games have there been?
1771427	1771647	Ms.
1771687	1772208	Pac-Man.
1772228	1775130	They redid a lot of old games.
1775871	1779194	I just remember a version of Warlords being in Lunar.
1780595	1781296	Lords of Lunar.
1782457	1783718	When they put it out on PS2.
1785197	1786377	This strikes me as those updates.
1786557	1789098	And I do remember the Pong one was actually pretty cool.
1789338	1792418	But the rest of them... You want to talk about update games that are good?
1792618	1792818	Huh.
1793398	1795279	New Sega Ages have been announced.
1795679	1796159	Oh, really?
1796559	1796859	Yes.
1797259	1797999	And these are good ones.
1799119	1802380	For example, the one that I'm happiest about is Panzer Dragoon.
1802480	1807061	They're going to remake the whole game and include the original on it.
1807301	1808421	It's coming to the PS2.
1808581	1809741	Some people... I have that.
1810041	1813942	Some people knocked the original classics that came out on PS2 saying it just...
1814822	1815122	and so on.
1838954	1841635	in order to give the game a perfect port for the first time.
1841655	1853439	Let's see here, we've also got Gunstar Heroes Treasure Box, which is Gunstar Heroes, Dynamite Headdy, Alien Soldier, and it says three of the treasure's best known Mega Drive titles.
1854080	1855320	His treasure rocks.
1855540	1859022	Yeah, and they also have Dynamite Deco, which was Die Hard in...
1860743	1862104	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1883015	1883856	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1911044	1914147	Remember kids, this is only to make backup copies of games you already own.
1927535	1927996	Right, okay.
1928356	1941951	And then the other thing that was announced is there's another group that's working on creating an external device to actually be able to run other types of memory cards.
1941971	1946336	Like, for example, USB flash drives, hard drives, and...
1948091	1952595	SD digital, SD cards and whatever, so basically other medias.
1953355	1960981	And there's another website, I believe WeAreBack is also them, with PSP development that they're going to make it so you can flash your PSP back to 1.5 or 1.0.
1961261	1961501	Oh boy.
1964230	1965931	The shit has hit the fan.
1966812	1969974	Pretty much, this would be... It's game over.
1970214	1973016	I'll be interested to see if Sony doesn't try to shut some of that stuff down.
1973036	1974357	We'll see.
1974437	1976459	Once it's on the internet, though, it's hard to get off.
1976559	1977139	It's pretty hard.
1977720	1983684	Other interesting things, though, I should mention, the DS, they have Super Nintendo and Nintendo emulators for it now, finally.
1984524	1986045	Of course, those are a little harder to come by.
1986065	1987146	A little harder to get on there, yeah.
1987166	1987746	Yeah, exactly.
1988807	1992250	They've actually started development on the PSP and the homebrew scene...
1993058	1993339	and so on.
2010444	2013845	Basically, you know, it's kind of an audio program.
2013865	2015546	You can make your own mixes and stuff.
2015626	2017887	PSP Paints is out there, paint program.
2018547	2025169	And the best part also, and this isn't really hacking, is new colored PSPs are rumored to be coming out soon.
2025850	2027810	One of the colors that's rumored is hot pink.
2028230	2029911	Wait, the actual, like, frames?
2030267	2031707	But not Sony endorsed.
2032068	2032708	No, it is Sony.
2033048	2033148	Oh!
2034108	2034868	In Japan, of course.
2035488	2037069	Yeah, but the black one is so cool.
2037549	2039730	Now, if they did a Sakura PSP, I'd have to have it.
2040510	2041850	I'd go for a nice dark green.
2041870	2043571	So that's what's really going on right now.
2043591	2050633	If you'd want to play a good updated port of a game or whatever, the new Namco Battle Collection, all remade games.
2050693	2053073	It's got Rally-X, Dig Dug, and all that stuff.
2053433	2054674	That's one to check out over...
2056813	2060618	Is it the same updates that have been on GameCube previously?
2060658	2061720	No, I don't think so.
2061820	2062581	I'll have to check that out.
2063522	2068329	I have one quick little hacking and cracking story.
2068389	2069490	Oh my god, you're into Slash.
2070748	2071969	Wow, that was a Freudian slip.
2072009	2072289	I don't know.
2072830	2074651	Quick hacking and cracking story.
2074691	2075752	I think this one's just cool.
2076512	2078614	This has to do with the program Stella.
2078694	2080435	It's an Atari 2600 emulator.
2080855	2089021	Well, Fred Quimby, the guy who develops games for that emulator, he released a BASIC compiler that can be used to create games to run on Stella.
2089321	2093324	And if you think about it, using that same technology, you could actually make your own Atari 2600 games in BASIC.
2095253	2096013	I just think that's kind of cool.
2096033	2096894	That's how a lot of them are done.
2097014	2098154	I don't know why, I just think that's neat.
2098174	2099195	You want to know what else is cool?
2099275	2099395	What?
2099415	2104777	We've got an Amiga emulator on the PSP now, and you know what you can run on Amiga?
2106058	2106818	Monkey Island.
2108479	2114422	Stella, more information on that emulator, stella.sourceforge.net, and that's S-T-E-L-L-A.
2114522	2116302	Oh, one last thing I forgot to mention.
2116482	2117103	GameMaker.
2117323	2118623	Remember the GameMaker programs?
2118643	2122265	They're on the PC, and they were on, you know, the PlayStation stuff, you can make your own games?
2122365	2122885	Sure, sure.
2122965	2123966	One's coming to the DS.
2125006	2126307	Like a legit game?
2126587	2127007	Legit.
2127247	2127567	Awesome.
2127868	2128408	Who's putting it out?
2128428	2128768	Do you remember?
2129268	2132470	I believe it's... Oh, God, I can't remember who the original company was.
2133491	2134251	It's the same company.
2134271	2134471	AgeTech.
2134531	2137893	AgeTech's doing RPG Maker 3.
2137933	2140714	I got to see RPG Maker 3 at their booth at E3.
2140734	2141355	Well, let me see here.
2141475	2142615	It says right on it.
2143196	2145517	It is... How was it at E3?
2146417	2146978	It was pretty good.
2147018	2148138	I didn't get to see a whole bunch of it.
2149179	2150520	They were more focusing on Front Mission.
2151140	2151280	Hmm.
2151590	2153711	It does not say who's putting it out.
2153851	2154751	I was like, isn't that a Square game?
2155071	2155711	No, not Front Mission.
2157592	2157992	The other one.
2158332	2166294	But apparently, I guess with this game maker, you can actually make games from a multiplayer game to 3D games.
2166575	2168555	So this is not just an RPG maker.
2168895	2170516	Also, White DS is coming out soon.
2171076	2171456	Whoop-de-doo.
2172438	2181420	Alright, we here at Orange Launch Radio, we're not just about talking about video games all the time, because if we talked about video games all the time, we would have no time to go out and eat tacos.
2182180	2190882	So we are here to better your life, and what better way to better your life than DarkSakura giving you a little piece of her advice with her advice column.
2191342	2193362	DarkSakura, what are you going to talk to us about tonight?
2195343	2200104	Today's life lesson, bit of advice, call it what you will.
2200996	2202777	is how to perform a tracheotomy.
2203977	2206498	Because you never know when you have to give someone a tracheotomy.
2207898	2211879	Number one, find the person's Adam's apple thyroid, that's the thyroid cartilage.
2212600	2220042	Move your finger about one inch down the neck until you feel another bulge, the cricoid cartilage, I guess that's how it's pronounced.
2220102	2221422	It's C-R-I-C-O-I-D.
2222202	2229265	The indentation between the two is the cricothyroid membrane where the incision will be made.
2231155	2236517	Using a razor blade or knife, make a horizontal incision about half an inch across and half an inch deep.
2237377	2236517	3.
2237937	2241138	Pinch the incision open or place your finger inside it to slit it open.
2241158	2241138	4.
2242899	2246380	Insert a tube in the incision roughly and half inch to one inch deep.
2247340	2246380	5.
2247780	2249561	Breathe into the tube with two quick breaths.
2252126	2258030	You will see the chest rise and the person should regain consciousness if you have performed the procedure correctly.
2258531	2261333	However, if you have performed it incorrectly, they will bleed to death.
2263894	2265215	Any final pieces of advice?
2265876	2270419	Yeah, just don't go hanging out on the smoking porch when people are about to choke to death.
2271279	2273561	Always check and see if there's a doctor nearby first.
2274061	2277584	You know, I learned something because I once saw this on a TV show.
2277644	2279385	All they did was jam a big pen in there.
2280738	2281198	Big Pens.
2281578	2281798	Yep.
2282358	2283259	Emergency tracheotomy.
2285319	2289000	I was wondering though, a woman doesn't have an Adam's apple.
2292320	2299182	I did this try to feel, and see, I have this thing about my neck where if I touch my neck, if anything touches my neck, I get nauseous.
2300062	2305663	But I had to find, and I think I found the spot for a woman.
2305723	2308084	It's about maybe two-thirds down.
2308484	2309064	Eve's apple.
2310393	2314356	All right, anyway, this is kind of interesting.
2316177	2326005	Rumors going around the internet that Rare, which by the way is now like a Microsoft subsidiary, they're looking at developing Nintendo DS games, which makes a lot of people go, huh?
2326766	2336173	But sure enough, on their website, they're looking for experienced 3D artists for Nintendo DS and games programmers for the Nintendo DS.
2337387	2339369	And this just kind of makes us go, huh?
2339989	2341730	Is Microsoft going to do something with the DS?
2341770	2343772	Killer Instinct 3 on the DS!
2345513	2346754	That would make me happy, actually.
2346854	2354099	If Microsoft has no plans to enter the handheld market, I could see where this is just, hey, why not make money off someone else's console?
2355720	2358562	Assuming, again, that Microsoft has no plans to enter the market.
2358902	2362805	But of course, have you heard those rumors about the Xbox 360 is supposed to interact with the DS?
2362885	2363305	I'm like, what?
2363365	2363666	And PSP.
2363706	2363926	No.
2365201	2367123	Yes, and all it is is a docking station.
2368384	2370865	I went to the Xbox 360 demo thing.
2371346	2380012	They have a docking station for the 360 that is basically any USB device or any type of device with transfer capability.
2380936	2385037	They have a docking station to connect to MP3 players like the iPod or the iRiver.
2385718	2398202	MP3, they have for mini disc players, for all kinds of variety, for digital cameras, scanners.
2398982	2406865	They basically are having a docking station to go with the 360 that's going to interface with basically any kind of digital media device.
2407817	2416244	What I heard was they're going to be using the Xbox 360 as basically you can use the PSP and the DS to play games over the internet.
2416324	2418266	Microsoft games over the internet.
2418306	2418706	Weird.
2418746	2424411	So basically what I'm thinking is it'll basically use those two devices as a Bluetooth controller.
2425772	2428414	I can't believe it until I see it, honestly.
2428494	2428935	I doubt it.
2429235	2429495	I know.
2430356	2436501	At the demo thing that I went to, they were doing, you know how they do little stylish outlines of different things and showing what?
2436820	2438440	They had a freaking outline of a PSP up there.
2439041	2439741	That's kind of weird.
2439941	2440341	That's weird.
2441041	2441781	Alright, well, we'll see.
2443742	2444222	Moving on.
2444262	2449884	This is a story that's kind of been making that rounds on the web forums and being passed around via various emails.
2449924	2450304	Get this.
2450804	2458986	An 11-year-old boy stabbed his baby nephew in the stomach after the infant's crying disrupted his PlayStation game.
2460748	2465272	The PlayStation game in question had something to do with the Incredibles, basically, some type of port of the Incredibles.
2466173	2477664	And the boy told police that in the minutes before the incident, he kept losing while he was playing the game, and then the crying made him feel like an erupted volcano.
2478621	2480802	Sounds like this kid's got anger management issues.
2481442	2482342	But what do you think?
2482363	2483863	They'll try to pin this on the game anyway.
2483963	2484443	I don't think so.
2484563	2486084	No, because it's Disney.
2486384	2489065	Or was it Pixar?
2489205	2491946	If it were Grand Theft Auto, oh yeah.
2492527	2493627	Rockstar's getting a call.
2494187	2495908	And on top of that, this and this in the UK.
2498365	2503528	The news story I'm getting is from the UK, but I actually... No, I caught his slang.
2504369	2507591	I wanted to say, I thought it was actually in Florida or something.
2507631	2508232	In Florida?
2508472	2509372	Is there a location listed?
2509973	2515757	No, because they went to the Diana Princess of Wales hospital.
2517078	2517258	Wow.
2518447	2519507	Which I don't think there's one in Florida.
2519708	2522429	Whole Crown Court, yeah, I guess it was in the UK.
2522569	2523009	I'm sorry.
2523029	2524970	I thought this happened in the US.
2525010	2525950	It could have happened in the US.
2525970	2527851	I don't think that kind of reaction would happen there.
2529312	2532333	Because, honestly, Americans are a lot more freaking hysterical.
2533413	2537195	True, but you know somebody's going to try and pin this on the games.
2538319	2540360	because video games are evil.
2541341	2544023	I don't think that that's the same mindset there that it is here.
2544744	2548647	I would actually really love to hear from any of our UK listeners.
2550468	2558554	If there's any type of flashback, anything that's been in the news or anything, I would seriously like to know because I would love to compare the difference in reaction.
2559289	2560990	That would just amuse me to no end.
2561090	2564753	Togo, T-O-G-O, at OrangeLawnTrader.com if you want to send us one of those emails.
2565533	2566834	Moving on, trying to wrap it up here.
2567254	2570797	Beautiful Joe was going to be called Beautiful Joe VFX Battle.
2571017	2573738	They're changing the name to Beautiful Joe Battle Carnival.
2574759	2577341	GameCube game coming out September 29th.
2577741	2579862	That makes me think too much of Carnival.
2580663	2581203	I know.
2581283	2582904	Battle Carnival is a little interesting.
2582924	2583665	That's a cool name, though.
2583985	2584325	We'll see.
2585146	2585406	We'll see.
2586671	2589853	And last but not least tonight, the guy game.
2589973	2590794	You remember this game?
2590874	2596037	They got a little bit busted early on because one of the chicks in it was not 18.
2597958	2604843	The guy game was banned, which I was surprised to see that the story had kind of hit...
2606643	2609927	This week, because I thought the thing got banned months ago when this first came out.
2610007	2612609	I think the PC version came out and it was on shelves.
2612769	2618235	Basically what it is, is that the temporary holding that was on the game became permanent.
2618755	2622379	And the Guy Games website does confirm this.
2622987	2623528	Just so you know.
2624028	2627491	If you get a copy, wait a couple weeks, slap that mother on eBay.
2627872	2628632	Well, here's the thing.
2629133	2634718	Now what they're going to do is they're going to put it all on a DVD called The Guy Game, Game Over, and sell it for $19.99.
2636760	2639803	Probably, I would guess, without the 17-year-old in question.
2639883	2642445	They'll just trim her on out of there and have a new DVD.
2644727	2645367	So there you have it.
2645447	2647889	Loki, interested in that purchase at all?
2647929	2648909	I already have the guy game.
2650090	2658894	What's interesting though is that actually Girls Gone Wild is doing this new thing called Girls Gone Wild games.
2659874	2660835	And it's actually...
2661326	2665447	The little mini... Not really the mini games, but if you... Rob played the guy game.
2665707	2669328	Remember at the very end of the guy game, they had the guy game challenge or whatever?
2670088	2674289	And where the women would do, like, they'd bounce on the ball or they would jump.
2674469	2675469	It's all that.
2675990	2679410	Oh, and they got, like, a minute bonus if they did it topless and things like that?
2679430	2679911	Yeah, exactly.
2679931	2680951	It's all that crap.
2681911	2683691	So, apparently, this will be popular.
2684432	2688773	How much you wanna bet that, you know, that Girls Gone Wild will put out a trivia game just like this?
2689353	2689813	One of these days.
2691112	2692233	It's gonna happen.
2692273	2692994	It's gonna happen.
2693834	2697297	And honestly, I think the guy game, they should do another one.
2698097	2701080	ID him first.
2701300	2701880	Exactly.
2702861	2705843	Alright, that's gonna do it for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio To Go.
2706184	2707204	Final thoughts, Loki?
2707885	2711168	I'm gonna play me some Killer7 and hopefully finish this game.
2712629	2716892	My final thought is rubbing together, oil, Dark Sakura.
2717312	2719354	We need the girl game with like
2720454	2723596	and then the special Yaoi edition.
2726497	2727077	Go ahead.
2727277	2727957	No, you first.
2728218	2731419	I was going to say, by the way, there's a new Guys Gone Wild DVD coming out.
2732299	2732780	Yay!
2735461	2739362	But my absolute final thought is reject bus icons!
2741003	2741683	That's going to do it.
2741703	2742764	We'll see you next time here.
2742824	2745005	Thank you for subscribing to our podcast.
2746733	2750297	That's the end of another Orange Lounge Radio To Go edition.
