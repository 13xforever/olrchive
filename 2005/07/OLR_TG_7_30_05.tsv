589	3470	Orange Lounge Radio To Go Edition, week of August 1st, 2005.
3630	14132	You're tuned in to the Orange Lounge Radio To Go Edition, your podcast home for all the latest video game news and gamer chat.
14392	18092	Now, here are your hosts, DarkSakura, Sky, and Loki.
19213	26114	Hello once again, everybody, and welcome to another edition of Orange Lounge Radio To Go Edition.
26909	34294	Our podcast dedicated to all those cool games, the niche games, the cult games, and games that don't suck, all the news you really want to know about.
34775	36696	My name is Rob Roberts, you might know me as Sky.
36776	42000	Joining me, as always, my awesome co-host over there, say hello to DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.
42520	44421	I sound so dead.
47984	49185	I'm undead.
50940	54721	I'm so dead, it kind of makes me think of zombie I actually have Resident Evil t-shirts
77139	79741	I'm mad though because the shirt that I want they only sell online.
80642	80922	Really?
80962	82003	What shirt's that?
82023	82243	2D.
82483	83324	They have a Gorillaz shirt.
83965	84625	It's only online.
84785	87167	That's not the same Resident Evil I'm thinking of.
89429	90009	Alright, anyway.
90089	93552	I already have a bunch of the ones they give to the video game stores.
93712	94933	I have all kinds of swag.
94973	96415	Yeah, we know you get the hookup.
96495	97015	Lucky you.
97035	98156	I got the major hookup.
98176	99817	For the rest of us, there's the store.
99937	100538	Thank you very much.
100878	102439	I got the major hookup this week.
102940	105142	Orange Launch Radio needs to give some of our listeners the hookup.
105162	106783	You know, we got some prizes we gotta start giving away.
107185	110866	So we'll have to do that in the next few weeks, but not tonight.
111126	115007	We're actually taping a little bit early this week because I'm going to be leaving.
115047	115767	I'm flying away.
115787	117708	I'm going to the East Coast very soon.
117788	120008	I have something for our listeners to hear.
120148	120549	What's that?
122149	122989	Your DS?
125650	126610	It's very quiet.
126730	127210	It's hard to hear.
129891	130371	What is this?
131151	132492	I hear some ambient noises.
135012	135753	I have Nintendogs.
136013	136793	Nintendogs?
138254	139255	How did you get Nintendo?
139295	140736	Now, this is not the Japanese version.
140916	141437	Nope, it's not.
141937	142638	This is the U.S.
142698	143038	version.
145960	147041	We can barely hear it on there.
147121	148022	I know, it's not very loud.
148042	149123	Tell us about your gaming week.
149163	149904	What's going on here?
150164	150944	What's up with the Nintendogs?
150984	154647	I have come into a copy of the five-minute demo of Nintendogs.
155448	159732	A lot of people were going to start writing you some nasty emails if you had the full version, but still, you got the demo.
159752	160332	That's kind of neat.
160772	161713	I've been playing with my puppies.
163415	163875	What, Loki?
164095	165116	I've got news on that, actually.
165646	168630	There are going to be people coming into the copies of Nintendogs early.
169050	169451	How so?
170432	172154	Well, if we want to get in the news right away.
172394	174897	No, let DarkSakura talk about the game first, then we'll get to that.
176059	181145	Okay, so tell us a little more about the game, because at E3, the line was so big to play.
181630	182130	I heard it bark.
182430	187532	The line was so big to play this game at E3 that I barely got a chance to really look at it.
187772	192053	I know it was one of my favorite games of the show, but you've actually had a chance to play it a little more in detail this week.
192673	194014	What the heck is Nintendogs?
194074	195054	What makes it so dang special?
195074	196335	You play with your bubbies.
201216	202757	What makes it so great, though?
203057	204037	You play with your bubbies.
204177	204757	That's it?
204837	205838	You just play with dogs?
205858	206438	Listen to this.
206718	206998	What are you...
212301	213713	Okay, so they're barking, we get it.
214096	214479	That's cute.
215751	218932	If we had the graphics, especially, because the graphics are a real cute part of this game.
218952	221233	You can play music to your puppies and they start barking along with it.
222534	225275	And you can throw the frisbee and they catch it.
225515	227396	Have you noticed an object to this game at all?
228236	230097	You play with your puppies!
230377	237479	But even in Animal Crossing, which was a very free game where you could do practically whatever you wanted, there was still that goal of paying off your house.
237799	244562	Well, as you play through the game, you can train your dogs and stuff, and you compete in different events and stuff, like they have dog training events.
244977	246458	and you unlock more dog breeds.
247359	265073	And also, if other people, say for instance you have Nintendogs Chihuahua and someone has Nintendogs Labrador Retriever or something like that, if you're nearby and they interact with each other, it unlocks the Labrador Retriever and the one with Chihuahua and Chihuahua and the one with Labrador Retriever.
265593	272158	So even though they're selling this game, when they announced it was going on sale it sounded like Pokemon Red and Blue or only certain...
274361	276322	All the Japanese dogs are unlockable through the unlocks.
276342	280083	What we need to see, though, is if the Japanese version and the US ones will interact.
298271	300973	Oh, that would be interesting, because I know people over here with the Japanese version.
301113	305155	And if you walk by with the game and someone else has their dogs, they'll start barking.
305655	306195	That's cool.
306916	309858	If it detects another copy of the game on and playing nearby.
310018	311739	What did you think after your five-minute demo?
312419	313279	Puppies!
314140	315381	So in other words, you're sold on this game.
315641	316101	Puppies!
316221	317562	You'll be buying the full version when it comes out?
317582	319023	All they need, Mike, is Nintendo kitties.
319483	321824	Oh, I am buying all three versions when this comes out.
321884	323105	But you don't need all three versions!
323465	324246	I don't care!
326008	332453	I'm buying them for the strict purpose of annoying my co-worker because he hates this game because it's so damn cute.
332913	335635	And so I'm going to be playing it with the volume full blast.
335675	338958	Hey, you know what?
338998	341180	There's three of us, three versions of the game.
341200	342100	I'm getting in the lab already.
342260	344242	We should get the three different versions.
344262	344862	I'll get the Chihuahua.
344983	345923	All right, there we go.
346223	347184	And I'll get the Shih Tzu.
347224	348185	Hopefully it's in a different one.
350483	353026	I was going to get the lab anyway because it has other breeds that I want.
353186	360195	Like a Jack Russell Terrier and I think the miniature Dachshund.
360695	361536	I'm just going to buy all three.
362557	363759	You can't wait to trade.
364099	364820	You just need all three.
364860	366362	Well, at least I know where I get the dogs from.
366682	368044	Alright, anything else in your gaming week?
368925	369766	I play lots of Ragnarok.
370689	371649	Ragnarok Online
390182	390882	Like around the corner.
390902	392803	It was something that was going to be here by year's end.
392843	394104	I could have thought I read somewhere.
394444	394804	I hope.
394864	396385	I keep checking Gravity's site.
396765	400427	And then there's another game that one of our listeners suggested to us.
400447	406150	I got an email from Iris, who is in South Korea.
406670	407111	Hi, Iris.
407931	408691	That was my grandma's name.
409272	409532	Really?
409812	410492	That's a nice name.
411453	416655	Who suggested a game that I actually haven't had too much of an opportunity.
416715	417556	It's called Darwinia.
418453	424975	I like the name already, but I actually was intending on downloading it a couple of days ago and I had some computer issues.
425307	426568	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
454228	455209	DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen
483471	486934	I'm not actually going to buy any more movies, but I've been playing that.
487014	494899	I played Bomberman Panic Bomber, which I was hoping it was more of a Bomberman game, but it's another puzzle game.
495139	496440	This is the PSP one?
496600	497160	PSP one.
497620	500482	They have a lot of puzzle games for the PSP out there.
502363	504084	Really, yeah, those have been the games.
505645	506066	Anything else?
506286	506746	Just those games?
507287	508967	No, I wish I had played some PlayStation 2 stuff.
509007	510468	I'm waiting for Graffiti Kingdom.
510748	514169	They sent out a press release on Thursday saying, Oh, the game got shipped!
514449	515209	Go to GameStop.
515789	520330	No, we have our information that says it's coming out on August 8th or August 9th.
520390	522630	I'm like, yeah, that's what I heard before this press release came out.
522650	524171	Because nobody wants Graffiti Kingdom but you.
524431	525111	Yeah, they told me.
525331	529572	They're all, you're going to have to pre-order this game if you want it at all because we're getting like three copies total.
529992	532693	I'm like, fuck you, I will go to Fry's.
532833	533813	So, eat that.
535191	535691	Interesting.
536472	537853	Is that the sequel to Magic Penjel?
538093	539654	Sort of.
539774	546017	It's a sequel in the game sense, where you have the same gameplay and stuff, but the storyline is not a direct sequel.
546217	549399	Magic Penjel, for those that don't know, was this kind of cultish game.
549439	550440	I don't think it was really big.
550460	554202	It had a rock-paper-scissors battle style system, so it was pretty simple in concept.
554542	558725	But you could draw your own monsters, which was really the cool thing about it.
558765	561326	You literally drew your own... It's like Pokemon, but you draw your own Pokemon.
561626	562347	So of course...
563067	574170	My friends and I were playing this game and we were drawing all sorts of phallic things and just all the two-year-old type humor you could think of we were drawing.
574290	575511	And the game doesn't stop you.
577311	578912	Yeah, there was the big cock monster.
578972	580972	Yeah, I remember there was like the big cock monster.
581373	585334	And then I'm like, you know, I walked out of the room for a bit and I come back in.
585354	586394	I'm like, is that a cannon?
586594	587334	No, it's a penis.
587594	588415	Like, you can't draw.
588895	589115	Anyway.
589741	590721	Terminator, Robocop,
615609	616029	DarkSakura.com
632609	634369	Basically, I'll just read the little blurb on here.
634409	643832	The world of Darwinia is a virtual theme park running inside a computer network built by a computer genius named Dr. Sepulveda, I guess.
644212	644452	Okay.
645172	648933	Darwinia is populated by a sentient involving life form called the Darwinians.
649313	653714	They are the product of decades worth of research into genetic algorithms.
653994	655174	So what kind of game does it look like?
655194	657115	Because I thought this was just another, you know...
658061	661806	Ye Olde RPG style game, but this looks like a futuristic type thing.
661946	663949	It looks like The Sims meets Tron.
664389	665631	It looks kind of like Lawnmower Man.
667153	668054	To me, I don't know.
668154	670477	Let me look at a few more of these screenshots on here, though.
671418	672900	It really does look very...
674151	675672	Let's download the demo and check it out.
675812	677473	Because the listener was wanting us to check it out.
677593	680415	I had intended on doing so.
680595	683016	I'll probably get that started when I get home tonight.
683156	684277	It'll be a follow-up in the future.
685177	687479	My gaming week, I didn't play anything new, guys.
687679	689240	Sorry to say, I've been preparing for my trip.
689260	692782	But for some wacky reason, I decided to get back into Guild Wars.
693242	697945	Because I was like, okay, I'm not going to pay money to reactivate my Final Fantasy XI account when I'm going to be leaving soon.
698185	699846	And I don't want to start a new game again.
700166	702968	I've been contemplating checking out World of Warcraft.
703028	704669	One of my friends is really, really trying to get me on there.
705630	706911	I know, PSO.
707331	708652	DarkSakura's trying to get me on PSO.
709773	712054	But Guild Wars, luckily, loving it.
712495	714216	Once you buy it, you can play it forever for free.
714256	715897	No monthly fee, so I can go back whenever I want.
715937	719359	And I knew I would do this, too, that I'd play it for two weeks, leave, go back again.
719380	721481	But here's the weird thing about my habits with Guild Wars.
721801	722882	I started a new character.
723322	726004	Everybody in my old guild doesn't play the game anymore, so it's just me.
726304	728646	So here I am playing the game by myself, and I'm thinking...
729502	731223	I'm playing an MMO by myself.
733344	734024	What's the point?
734324	735965	But it's still kind of fun.
736045	738906	I think I'd be having more fun if there were people out there that would play with me.
740507	741988	If someone would buy me the game, I would play.
742428	744009	Oh, got 50 bucks to spare?
745189	746650	If someone would buy me the game, I would play.
747911	750592	Maybe we've got a really nice listener out there.
750652	752653	I sure as heck ain't paying money for it.
752673	753513	I've seen Guild Wars.
754594	755754	I like Guild Wars.
755794	756174	It's neat.
756254	756355	It's...
758620	760081	I don't like the style.
761181	761882	It doesn't bother me.
761902	762342	It's not pretty.
762962	767264	It's more of a strategy, like strategy action fused, which is kind of neat.
767284	771206	You'll have to pull my cold dead body away from Final Fantasy XI.
771546	773987	I may not have played it for over a month, but you know what?
774467	775508	I am not quitting.
775548	777909	Not from my cold dead hands.
777989	781891	I'm just pissed off that I can't download the Korean version of Ragnarok online.
782331	782651	Because the...
785112	792202	The Korean Ragnarok site is letting me get it, and I don't want to have to pay $30 for three more months of Ragnarok Online to play my old dead character.
793043	798230	Thing is, my character on the old Ragnarok will never be deleted.
798330	802155	For those that don't know Ragnarok, because we've talked about it an awful lot tonight, real quick, describe it.
803038	805159	It's really cutesy MMORPG.
805259	805980	It's adorable.
806760	809181	I found the picture of your character who wore the little ribbon.
809301	810642	Yes, I had a character that wore a ribbon.
811542	813723	But it's like Secret of Mana in a way.
814404	814944	Kind of.
815264	816285	But imagine it as an MMO.
816365	817265	In a 3D world.
818085	818986	It's really adorable.
819046	825989	If you just go to rocknrockonline.com Not 3D in the Halo or Doom 3D sense.
826009	829011	3D in the up at an angle shot.
829151	829271	Like
829904	832426	It's a 3D environment, but the characters are sprites.
832706	832866	Yes.
833446	833767	There you go.
834727	835007	All right.
836148	839290	Quick news story on Final Fantasy XI, since Loki brought it up to start us off tonight.
839971	843993	Since you're saying they won't tear the game from your cold, dead hands, how about a story that might tick you off?
844614	848696	Final Fantasy XI, the Vanadil Collection, will ship for the PC on August 16th.
849077	850398	What is this, a new expansion pack?
850798	857562	No, it's just Final Fantasy XI, Rise of the Zillert, and Chains of Promethea, and Tetra Master, all bundled together for $29.99.
859119	864122	So those of you guys that spent $50 on the game and $30 on the expansion, just got screwed.
864282	867344	But it happens with every MMO, it really does.
867464	869785	Well, look at Rise of the Zillards at one time.
870426	874248	It was being sold as an expansion, and then they just update it.
874728	875009	Whatever.
876058	877679	All right, just thought I'd share that.
878540	882163	Let's see, I actually have an abundance of Square news tonight.
882203	883964	Let me get some of these other Square stories out of the way.
884285	885846	Kingdom Hearts 2 has a date.
886386	892371	This being announced at the Squeenix Party 2005 event in Tokyo, hence why we have all the Squeenix news tonight.
892992	896655	Kingdom Hearts 2 will be out in Japan this year in December.
897195	899157	No set-in-stone date for the U.S.
899277	899457	yet.
899517	901939	However, they've really been pushing to localize their games quickly.
902359	904902	I have to admit, I'm surprised they're going to miss Christmas at this rate.
905482	908945	I would have thought Kingdom Hearts 2 would be a very powerful Christmas title to have out there.
908965	913590	It seems kind of silly to miss Christmas here, but it ain't my company.
914270	919075	Also keep in mind, though, when we get it, it's going to be better than the Japanese one.
919780	921101	People are going to buy it no matter what.
921141	922741	What makes you say it's going to be better than the Japanese one?
922781	923661	Just like the last one.
923681	925762	They actually had to redo an international version.
926222	930984	Yeah, Square Enix kind of does that stuff where they add... Because the Sephiroth battle wasn't in the original Kingdom Hearts, right?
931084	932004	That was something new for North America.
932024	940847	It actually wasn't in ours either, but they brought out the sort of updated international version that had the Sephiroth battle and the deep dive trailer.
941232	942513	Interesting.
942613	945215	Final Fantasy XII also got a date at the Squeenix party.
945315	948597	Ships in Japan on March 16th, 2006.
949437	950318	So still a little wait.
950358	953740	And that's just Japan's date, meaning we've got to wait three to four months.
953760	957222	So maybe we're looking at Christmas next year for Final Fantasy XII.
957722	958503	Rumors why?
959043	961145	Because Final Fantasy XII supposedly is in the can.
961365	962165	It's done in Japan.
962225	962886	It's ready to go.
963006	964627	Just they're putting the finishing touches on it.
964907	969430	But supposedly, because of the Kingdom Hearts 2 news, that's why they're waiting on Final Fantasy XII.
970762	973885	Final Fantasy VII Advent Children will be released in theaters in Japan
992200	996163	and probably in theaters in Berkeley and little tiny theaters.
996183	1000065	I told those Sony reps when they came to our work, I'm like, you got to fucking put this in theaters.
1000105	1001846	Well, man, it's all this marketing.
1001906	1004847	I'm like, word of mouth, word of mouth.
1004967	1008489	Well, nothing, not even news on any type of U.S.
1008549	1008869	release.
1008929	1011591	Little distributionary, no North American distribution as of yet.
1011931	1014592	Here's the reason why I'm thinking it's not going to happen in the U.S.
1014672	1017254	because it's going to premiere in Japan on September 8th.
1018171	1020872	The DVD, by the way, comes out September 14th.
1021253	1026135	So it's really just a super sneak preview for those diehard people that have to see it in the theater.
1026595	1028236	And if I was in Japan, I'd be one of them.
1028596	1029937	I think it's going to have a limited run here.
1030437	1030878	You think?
1031038	1032559	I don't... Escaflowne.
1034319	1035160	That had a limited run.
1035200	1035920	But would they get that?
1036100	1039122	I mean, we're talking... We're only about six weeks out from this now.
1039502	1041363	I don't think that's enough time to put together a theater release.
1041703	1043004	I do believe that there would be time.
1043224	1043704	We'll see.
1043864	1044245	We'll see.
1044305	1045525	Slap some subtitles on that.
1045785	1046466	We'll see.
1047958	1048699	Screwdubs.
1049039	1050900	Still more stories, still more stories.
1050960	1051640	Kingdom Hearts 2.
1052881	1057044	Hikaru Utada, of course, did the theme song for the first Kingdom Hearts game.
1057404	1058125	She's coming back.
1058205	1062647	She's going to sing a song called Passion, which will be in Kingdom Hearts 2.
1063508	1071393	No word yet as to whether she's going to record it in English and Japanese, but since she did the first one in English and Japanese... And she is fully bilingual.
1071513	1075316	Exactly, and she has her own album out here, which I don't think did so hot.
1075336	1075736	Mm-hmm.
1076623	1078646	She's easy breezy and you're Japanese-y.
1080367	1082330	Anyway, so she'll have the song Passion.
1082770	1085653	The single should be coming out, being put out by Toshiba EMI.
1085834	1090699	It will come out around December, same time as Kingdom Hearts 2 is planning to come out.
1091780	1094721	One more story I got, and it's a Final Fantasy XI story again.
1095021	1103885	You know how Xbox 360 Final Fantasy XI has everybody going, OMG, OMG, what's going to be different in the Final Fantasy XI version on Xbox 360?
1103985	1107226	Well, you're going to find out if you live in Germany.
1108894	1113656	Get this, they're actually going to be showing it in Germany at the Games Convention in Leipzig.
1113996	1116737	That happens August 17th through the 21st.
1117218	1127462	It doesn't say in the press release that it's going to be playable, but it does say in the press release that European gamers will get their first look at the next generation gateway to the world of Anadyl.
1128162	1128703	Should be interesting.
1129003	1134245	You know, I heard a rumor, one quick rumor about, for those of you Final Fantasy XI players, I don't know if this is true or not, but...
1135052	1140976	What they're going to do with the 360 is they're going to put the same upgrades in 360 that they do on the PC and PlayStation 2 users.
1140996	1142517	Unfortunately, you're going to get left behind in this.
1142857	1144618	But they're going to make the capes viewable.
1145039	1149121	It's supposedly something... Because you know how your character won't wear a cape in Final Fantasy XI, but you never see it?
1149621	1151643	Supposedly, that's going to be one of the graphical upgrades.
1151943	1153024	So, I don't know.
1153104	1154164	Take it with a grain of salt, people.
1154364	1156126	We'll find out when the game is shown in Europe.
1156146	1156826	But that would be kind of neat.
1156846	1161109	Maybe it's an option you would be able to turn on in the PC version if you have a high enough graphics card.
1161169	1162109	Oh, I don't see why not.
1162129	1162970	Certainly.
1163010	1164431	My graphics card would handle it.
1164639	1165179	Yeah, most of them.
1165199	1169082	Well, I'm surprised they haven't released a patch like that for capes in the PC version.
1169262	1170262	Well, maybe they're waiting for this.
1171023	1171223	Yeah.
1171363	1172203	Well, you never know.
1172223	1173924	I mean, they can do... Who knows?
1173964	1179307	With the new 360 game coming out, they're probably going to release another expansion at the same time.
1180228	1180648	There you go.
1180688	1181168	Maybe.
1181408	1181669	Maybe.
1181689	1182169	We don't know yet.
1182409	1183229	Well, possibly.
1183390	1183650	All right.
1183670	1183990	We'll see.
1184110	1191294	Anyway, let's go past the Squeenix news, and let's get into inflating our egos a little bit by opening up the old mailbag.
1191454	1192755	So if you want to send us an email...
1193897	1201526	All you have to do is send an email to togo, T-O-G-O, at orangeloungeradio.com and DarkSakura will have something to say to you.
1201967	1203168	DarkSakura, what do you have to say tonight?
1203689	1205831	I actually got a bunch of email.
1206873	1210337	And one, um... The first one I want to bring up is by, um...
1211574	1216839	Someone named Rue, who wrote in to us about the whole hot coffee deal.
1217540	1226569	And actually, and this is something that I actually didn't see on any of my references, but when I went back and dug deeper after receiving the email, yes it is true.
1227270	1233056	The whole deal was actually sort of launched off by Hillary Clinton.
1234031	1235312	Kind of.
1235432	1236952	She got behind it, too.
1237092	1241634	I think having her behind it really threw the thing into orbit.
1241794	1243535	I mean, it was kind of like where it went to the next level.
1243835	1252219	But I believe it was originally brought to the attention by Assemblyman Leland Yee, I think, because they had this guy on G4 TV.
1252239	1255400	And usually I don't talk about G4 TV because...
1256120	1260363	They have a reputation for having bad programming, but actually it's gotten a lot better.
1260763	1266407	I actually watched G4TV.com, and ever since they got that new guy on the show, he's really brought it up.
1266427	1271631	The two girls are up to that same level, I think, because they actually had the Leland Yee on their show.
1271811	1273492	It was actually a pretty good interview, I have to say.
1273672	1275233	It was kind of interesting, I thought.
1275533	1276574	Sorry, I just wanted to interject that.
1277335	1283579	Well, this email, though, basically it's not just the conservatives that are behind it.
1284487	1298492	we've got basically everybody and you know it also brought up to the whole reason why I didn't go Democrat way back you know because of Lieberman I was not going to have Lieberman and Tipper Gore anywhere near our video game industry
1299789	1318339	There was also, though, another article, though, this made me think of, that I'm going to get back to the mailbag, I just have to see where I stored this article, about how actually the rate of crime in our country's youth decreased.
1318359	1319280	Do you have a link to this?
1319320	1321061	I bet a lot of people would be interested in reading this.
1321661	1323042	Yes, I do, and it's going to...
1323968	1325090	Take me just a brief moment.
1325170	1326733	Actually, if you'll take care of one of our other emails.
1326773	1327113	That's all right.
1327133	1328135	Yeah, I'll go to one of the other emails.
1328175	1331841	I just want to say, was that the same guy who you invited to do the article for the site?
1332042	1332482	Yes, it is.
1332542	1335207	I invited him to write an editorial regarding that for us.
1335227	1335768	That would be cool.
1336108	1337110	Like I said, guys...
1338755	1348962	Politics and gaming podcasts sometimes don't mix, but that's alright, you know, hey, we gotta, you know, whatever you believe in, at least go out and vote, cause we get the freedom to do that in this country.
1349002	1361111	Jesus, you know, here's what it comes down to, okay, the whole hot coffee mod hit a little too close to home, if you know what I mean, with Hillary Clinton, because the whole hot coffee mod starts off with CJ coming in for some lovin',
1362083	1362884	What's the woman do?
1362904	1364504	She gets down to business.
1365345	1366565	Oh, damn.
1367086	1367606	Oh, damn.
1367626	1368306	Oh, oh, oh.
1368406	1368866	Wait, wait.
1368946	1370567	Oh, that happened to Hillary.
1370787	1371728	That happened to Hillary.
1371768	1372468	Look, look, look.
1372828	1379071	I think the issue here is really about the regulation of the games, not trying to ban them.
1379411	1382953	And I think, remember, guys, Hillary Clinton isn't trying to ban the games.
1382993	1384334	She's trying to regulate them.
1384494	1387595	She's basically, again, encouraging parents not to do their job.
1388396	1391297	Which, you know, even though I am a Democrat, I'll admit it.
1391792	1394354	I don't necessarily have to support her on every little thing she does.
1394394	1402639	This is one of those things where I think every senator, Republican, Democrat, and the one independent guy could all be educated on the gaming world a little bit.
1402720	1403280	Thank you very much.
1404100	1405361	Well, I did have that article here.
1406002	1408524	It can be located, I'll go ahead and give the address.
1408844	1417790	It's gr.bolt.com slash articles slash violence slash violence.htm Hey, it has violence in there twice.
1417810	1418390	It can't be that bad.
1420634	1424816	Anyway, this was written by Duke Ferris, who writes on this site.
1424896	1426176	It's a game revolution is what it is.
1426196	1433058	So he's basically presenting facts to show that violence has gone down, not up, amongst children.
1433078	1438720	This information that he's reported on here, it's actually a very well-written article, which really surprised me for this site.
1439900	1441841	It's using statistics put out by the U.S.
1441881	1444302	Department of Justice Bureau of Statistics.
1444982	1449123	and information also pulled from the files of the FBI, public files.
1450724	1463867	Basically, it's showing that since right before the release of the PlayStation, we've got basically a mark showing from 93 on, crime has decreased.
1465430	1466110	See, I don't know.
1466150	1473814	There's got to be a loophole somewhere because, and now granted, I'm about to say, watching the news every night, you would think the complete opposite to be true.
1473894	1474314	But yes, I know.
1474334	1476074	Of course, the news is trying to glamorize us.
1476094	1476855	The news sensationalizes it.
1477195	1477495	Anyway.
1477535	1482217	Because, you know, again, they make their money by fooling the public.
1484138	1485358	Here come those emails again.
1485378	1487339	Wait, you mean it's not hot outside?
1488820	1489220	Anyway.
1489833	1490614	Check out the article.
1490654	1491714	Give the link one more time.
1491854	1493155	Draw your own conclusions from this, guys.
1493175	1493515	No, no, no.
1493735	1498939	Again, keep in mind, I'm not really talking, you know, your local news is cool, I think.
1499719	1505543	At least, you know, whenever I watch the news here, I don't see anything sensational or anything out of the ordinary.
1505603	1510766	I'm talking about, like, they pick one instance, and then it's all on CNN.
1510966	1514028	You're talking about, like, MSNBC doing the Michael Jackson trial 24-7.
1514648	1515508	Exactly.
1515748	1516589	Now that I can agree with.
1516629	1527132	It's like they take one issue, blow it way out of proportion until suddenly the entire public thinks every kid who ever plays a video game is going to come cut off my head in my sleep.
1528012	1531013	Lord have mercy, we all is going to die from GTA.
1531954	1532394	Yeah, that.
1533214	1536695	Which I'm sure you're going to talk about the grandma.
1537516	1538936	Oh yeah, I'll bring up grandma in a minute.
1539904	1540144	What?
1540645	1540965	Go ahead.
1541305	1542646	There was one other thing in here.
1544868	1557378	I mean, it's basically one of the charts on here, which is what I would like to show to most of our listeners, is that there is a very good chart on here that separates everything by age, by age group.
1557978	1562982	And actually in the group, the biggest decline in violent crime was between the 14 and 17 year old group.
1565494	1565935	It's wow.
1566115	1567796	Okay, well, give the link one more time.
1567936	1569157	Let folks draw their own conclusions.
1569517	1569977	Give them the article.
1570058	1577603	It's dr.bolt.com slash articles slash violence slash violence.htm And I'll go ahead at some point... Post that in our forums.
1578023	1582286	Oh, actually, we'll repeat a link to the article on our announcements on the website.
1582646	1583327	Sounds good.
1584221	1585682	Alright, did you still want me to read the next letter?
1585922	1586242	Good point.
1586363	1592207	Okay, I got an email here from Justin M, and this is nice because this is just nothing but an ego inflation letter.
1593267	1599492	I, like many others, discovered your fine podcast through iTunes version 4.9, and I just wanted to let you know that you were doing a wonderful job with it.
1599592	1599952	Thank you.
1600693	1605976	I have heard of Orange Launch Radio before, but didn't have the time to sit down and listen to a live show every week, the shows we do on Sunday night.
1607357	1612021	Having it readily available on my iPod to listen to whenever, I'm ready to just...
1614181	1615122	The grammar gets weird here.
1615642	1621808	Unbelievably huge step in the right direction for talk shows, and it really helps bring out some of the talent that would otherwise lie untapped.
1621848	1624130	Well, that's quite a compliment.
1624150	1625351	Thank you very much for that email.
1625611	1636240	And the most we can ask, get a friend to subscribe to the show, tell one person about the show, and then the news of Orange Lounge spreads everywhere, and we're all happy, and you're happy because you get a new show every week, and et cetera, et cetera.
1636772	1642857	I did want to make a mention that one of our listeners, Michael, thought it was really cool that we were talking about Scorched Earth.
1643297	1645379	Dude, Scorched Earth was the game.
1645819	1648601	That was my junior high school lunches for like a year.
1648821	1649822	It is still the game.
1650162	1654106	In fact, I'm still waiting for them to finish the PSP homebrew version.
1654126	1655286	They're doing a PSP homebrew version?
1655306	1656387	Uh-huh, they are.
1657048	1658909	I fully endorse the PSP for these reasons.
1660330	1661571	And then there was also...
1664777	1670198	One of our Macintosh supporters wrote in, but... I know where this is going, Loki.
1672278	1676099	I forwarded this to Loki earlier.
1677199	1689201	No offense, because I appreciate receiving the email, but when one is speaking of the general intelligence level of a Macintosh user, make sure you use your spell checker and grammar checker before sending your email.
1690061	1693122	Because I counted no less than 15 grammatical and spelling errors.
1694943	1695583	That's ironic.
1696083	1696863	Loki, just shut up.
1696924	1697584	Don't go there.
1698444	1701225	I have a Max story at the end, and I think it's cool.
1701305	1703285	Listen, I'm not knocking the Max, okay?
1703305	1706746	Because, granted, the processing power may not be what I'm looking for.
1707006	1708226	Their cases look cool, though.
1708346	1708586	Okay?
1708606	1709547	Their cases are nice.
1709647	1711327	Freaking widescreen monitor.
1711347	1711627	Hold on.
1711647	1712767	The monitor is nice.
1712948	1715408	Did we go to Bizarro Orange Lounge Radio?
1715448	1718369	Because I just heard Loki say something nice about a Macintosh.
1718849	1723996	The cases look nice, but that's all they are is just a big graphing calculator inside of a nice case.
1724276	1726358	Somebody put a death threat out on you, didn't they?
1726939	1727159	No.
1728121	1732947	It's like I had... You know, when we were conversing about this while I was supposed to be at work...
1736604	1747914	The Mac is a very, I think, best used for either people who are not up to a PC or for the professional needing the specific benefits that a Mac provides.
1748234	1748854	Let me put it this way.
1748874	1757942	If you're going to pick between a Mac, an iMac or whatever, and an eMachine, go with the iMac because eMachines suck even more, and that's pretty bad.
1757982	1759563	That was kind of a nice thing.
1759583	1762285	Make sure you're on there.
1762506	1762746	I'm on.
1762926	1763006	Oh.
1763465	1766814	E-Machines, however, are very good for modifying.
1767356	1768659	They are very easily upgraded.
1768679	1768980	All right.
1769080	1770865	Anyway, back to the games.
1771105	1772329	Although I was at the Apple Store today.
1773325	1777347	I went to Fry's and I'm thinking about getting an iMac G5.
1777367	1782470	Just because a regular G5 is freaking expensive.
1782490	1786412	And that 30 inch widescreen monitor.
1786712	1787392	I got an email here.
1787432	1788012	Can I read this one?
1789133	1792134	This was somebody who has way too much time on their hands.
1792214	1797217	It's from Cliff R. Cliff sent us an email letting us know our statistics.
1797924	1799145	Thanks for watching!
1825588	1827109	I didn't care before, but I do now.
1827289	1827970	That was very cool.
1847701	1855124	Our live show wrote in, DJ Ranma S. Ranchan, in his email, he said this.
1855184	1857684	His 13-year-old cousin got GTA San Andreas for PS2.
1858625	1861846	Now he plays this game all the time and, believe it or not, knows better.
1862266	1864247	The interactions of the game has no effect on him.
1864747	1869348	I say that because his mother and me talk to him all the time about these games, gang's life, and everything else.
1869768	1874550	I admit he does hang out with friends that act more ghetto than CJ at times, but I
1876668	1879869	I can't believe that he doesn't do anything they do.
1880450	1881550	And that I was right.
1882790	1883591	And I'm going to quote here.
1883671	1887532	Parents, if you're listening to this podcast, your kids need home training.
1887932	1890633	Teach them the difference between real life and fantasy, for God's sake.
1891854	1892294	Well said.
1892414	1895815	I think gamer parents are pretty well aware of that stuff.
1895955	1896295	I hope.
1896435	1896916	I really hope.
1897996	1898256	Anyway.
1898696	1900897	We're going into a new generation of gaming parents.
1901417	1904478	Remember, parents, treat games like they're drugs.
1904699	1905739	Talk to your kids.
1906814	1910336	If you talk to your kids about drugs, they're less likely to do drugs.
1910676	1914517	They're more likely to know the difference between right and wrong if you talk to them.
1915438	1918379	You're in a very nice mood tonight, Loki.
1918839	1920820	You're all about love and affection today.
1920920	1922860	Once we bring up Grandma, it's going downhill.
1922880	1923541	Can I have a hug?
1924021	1925001	No.
1925021	1926222	That made me think of one thing.
1926762	1928062	Where did you learn to do that?
1928142	1928943	I learned it from you!
1934062	1935263	Okay, I'll talk about Grandma now.
1935343	1935703	Get this.
1936303	1940945	An 85-year-old woman suing Take-Two Entertainment over the hot coffee mod.
1941445	1947267	She purchased the game for her 14-year-old grandson and is now suing Take-Two.
1947507	1949988	This has been passed around on every gaming message board.
1950349	1953770	Surely those of you guys that are checking gaming websites of any capacity have heard about this.
1954611	1960354	and you probably just went, WTF lady, why were you buying this game for your 14 year old kid in the first place?
1960414	1971760	Again, that's another case of a person in a parental position not doing their research and not doing their goddamn job.
1973441	1976603	And she's got some balls to be suing Take-Two Entertainment over it too.
1976623	1977223	She's gonna lose.
1978084	1980085	She bought the game and gave it.
1980698	1985900	If she did not want offensive material to be put in the hands of a child, she would have done her research, don't you think?
1985960	1988541	But what she's saying is that now the game is A-O.
1988641	1990402	She wasn't fully educated before.
1991263	1991723	You know what?
1991823	1993444	It still had an M rating on it.
1993464	1994524	Just playing devil's advocate here.
1995324	1996625	I'm not going to say I disagree with you people.
1996645	1997445	I'm just playing devil's advocate.
1997465	1998806	It still had an M rating on it.
1998826	1999446	It's like, damn it.
1999506	2002367	I thought that game was rated R, not NC-17.
2002467	2003188	What the hell?
2003628	2004808	Okay, listen, Grandma.
2004988	2008270	First off, okay, I know you might have watered in there, you know, because...
2008610	2012212	You didn't know where you were and you might have bought this game for your grandson.
2012232	2015134	You know, I'm thinking the grandson probably begged her to buy it.
2015594	2017736	Okay, so she bought the game.
2018116	2023620	Did it say in the article that he figured out how to unlock the hot coffee mod content?
2026514	2027275	No, it did not.
2027395	2030997	It specifically said because she found out that that content was in there.
2031358	2036561	Therefore, we could say that he may not have been exposed to this content at all.
2037122	2039023	So, she's retarded.
2039944	2041405	She is friggin' retarded.
2042486	2044127	She has no legal precedent either way.
2044387	2047469	Her lawyer's not going to try to dissuade her because her lawyer's still going to make his money.
2049390	2049951	Moving on.
2050219	2051241	DarkSakura, you have a story on this one.
2051261	2052623	A blind teenager from Lincoln, Nebraska, who...
2066284	2069205	can kick anybody's butt at Mortal Kombat, basically.
2069725	2076187	Although I think this article is pretty stupid just because they talk about decapitations in Soul Calibur that don't happen.
2076208	2082110	That was the first thing I noticed in the article, too, that made me kind of go, stupid media person, do your research before you talk about games.
2082130	2084670	They talk about decapitation in Soul Calibur, which doesn't happen.
2085111	2093213	This guy probably thought that Soul Calibur, that the reporter must have been blind, too, because apparently Soul Calibur 2 and Mortal Kombat Deadly Alliance are the same game.
2093233	2094174	No.
2095840	2100162	But at any rate, it sounds like he just learned by trial and error how to play.
2102163	2104043	People would correct him when he did something wrong.
2104063	2107024	His favorite thing, he wants to be a video game designer when he graduates.
2107925	2109986	Which, you know, I could see happening.
2111166	2112086	No pun intended.
2112346	2116168	He plays facing away from the screen.
2117648	2121350	People challenge him strictly on his blindness and he still kicks their butt.
2121930	2131333	Which I can actually understand that if you understand the timing of your attacks, know who you're using, and hear the reaction on screen, there shouldn't be any reason.
2131353	2132493	I challenge you on mute.
2133033	2137494	But still, but still, a heck of an accomplishment.
2137594	2141055	I mean, even though we could kind of think about, okay, this is probably how he does it still.
2141675	2144856	What a lot of time and patience and discipline to become that good at a game.
2144936	2146036	So, hats off to this guy.
2146056	2148497	Apparently he enjoys freaking people out by playing backwards.
2148991	2149431	That's cool.
2149692	2151053	Can we play him on Xbox Live?
2151073	2153234	Does it have a screen tag, gamer tag on there?
2153334	2154215	This is on Yahoo News.
2154395	2154515	Ah.
2155656	2160340	But, you know, if he happens to be listening to, you know, his, what's his name, Bryce?
2161164	2166987	If he is listening to this podcast, or if anyone who's listening to this podcast knows him, we would love to interview him.
2167467	2167867	Absolutely.
2168248	2170088	And we would love to challenge him on Xbox Live.
2170269	2170769	Absolutely.
2171169	2171769	To DDR.
2172590	2173090	I'm just kidding.
2173130	2173470	I'm kidding.
2174671	2175491	I have the Mortal Kombat game.
2175511	2175971	We could play that.
2176612	2177092	Or Halo.
2177692	2179193	Anybody can beat my ass in Halo.
2179233	2180914	Hey, I had an 8-year-old kid blow me away the other day.
2180934	2182134	He's holding an Xbox controller.
2182835	2183955	I see an Xbox on the floor.
2183975	2184275	Okay.
2184856	2185116	We'll see.
2186297	2188837	Moving on, another news story coming up here.
2189518	2193958	G4ia, that big video games award show that happens on G4 every year.
2194078	2198759	It is going to air on August 9th, but that doesn't mean we won't ruin it for you right now.
2199319	2200780	The game of the year was Halo 2.
2201700	2204781	Favorite character was the Kratos in God of War.
2205241	2207881	EB Gamer's Choice Award went to World of Warcraft.
2209201	2210862	Did Katamari Damacy win anything?
2211162	2211402	Yes.
2211622	2212462	Best innovation?
2213354	2213974	That one game.
2214214	2216055	Let's see how many awards Halo 2 got.
2216515	2226458	Best Boss, Best Multiplayer Game, Best Original Soundtrack, Best Shooter, Best Sound Design, Best Voice Performance, and Game of the Year.
2226618	2228239	So it's a Halo 2 whoring fest.
2228259	2232240	You know, and other than Licensed Soundtrack, where's the love for Grand Theft Auto?
2232260	2233241	That game was at the top.
2233361	2234761	It's still at the top of the charts.
2235161	2237682	And all the guys, Best Licensed Soundtrack.
2237702	2239823	Best Licensed Soundtrack was the only award that came out.
2239863	2240303	Lame!
2241798	2242738	Lame, lame, lame.
2242778	2244959	Halo was just another first-person shooter.
2245499	2248400	Grand Theft Auto San Andreas was a revolution.
2248640	2253102	There's tons of emails coming your way that are going to disagree with you on that.
2253842	2256343	Personally, I actually enjoy Halo 2 more than Grand Theft Auto.
2256623	2256883	I do.
2257543	2262345	I think the multiplayer party aspect of it makes it, for me, a more fun game.
2263635	2266016	DarkSakura, you have any other news stories for us tonight?
2266056	2266096	Um...
2290169	2296194	We actually... A game that's coming out shortly, and I'm actually trying to get the US release date, because I know it's coming out very soon.
2296955	2299657	Fire Emblem Path of Radiance is coming out.
2299697	2303460	My fiancé has just been pissing his pants waiting for this to come out.
2303580	2304240	Thank you for that visual.
2304901	2305221	Thank you.
2305661	2309605	Well, he's been even downloading... Because we were very disappointed when...
2310512	2315076	You know the Fire Emblem on Game Boy Advance that had Marth and Roy in it?
2315297	2316218	It didn't come out over here.
2316538	2321423	But the one after that did, which actually is a prequel to that, and then the one following came out.
2322690	2327972	Dan's just really been into Fire Emblem, and it actually may be the first strategy game that I might actually give a serious chance.
2328452	2341515	The last one I played was the Macross game on the PC Engine, which... Anyway, but Fire Emblem, Path of Radiance is coming out to GameCube, and I was checking out the UK news, and of course I saw that, I instantly went to it.
2342315	2344936	Path of Radiance has a November release date.
2345256	2348437	I don't have the specific date, but it's said to come out this November.
2349398	2351440	Loki, what's going on in the hack and crack world right now?
2366464	2372848	Lots of stuff, especially with people getting their panties in a bunch over version 2.0 of the firmware for PSP.
2373609	2379873	You've got a brand new homebrew version of a web browser that's actually been released right now.
2379913	2381634	Now there's four options for web browsing.
2382455	2386778	This one is called actually the 2CH browser.
2387118	2392401	And really the first version of it can only visit the site 2ch.jp or some Japanese site.
2393612	2394554	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2402703	2406926	Snuff with the 2.0 browser, which actually supports Java and downloads and whatnot.
2407706	2408367	So that's pretty cool.
2409207	2416772	Also, one of the really cool games that came out this week for the PSP Homebrew was actually a port of Super Smash Bros.
2417013	2417453	No way.
2417813	2418073	Yeah.
2418373	2419174	Super Smash Bros.
2419254	2422556	GP, which was actually for the console GP32.
2422936	2428700	They made it for that portable system, but now they've ported it and you can put your own characters in there.
2428880	2431222	Does it look like the GameCube one, though?
2433484	2434685	It has the look and feel.
2434745	2435926	It has the feel of it.
2436046	2440289	It's not exactly the same detail and look, but hey, homebrew, come on.
2441110	2441731	It's still fun.
2443312	2444653	So that came out.
2446081	2456827	Oh, Sony is letting everyone know not to upgrade your US PlayStation portables to the 2.0 because that's meant for only Japanese PlayStations and it could harm your PlayStation and turn into a brick.
2456987	2457748	Will that stop you?
2457868	2458208	No!
2458508	2459509	No, that won't stop people.
2459569	2465172	But anyways, as far as the DS stuff goes here, there's been a few things being worked on.
2465192	2467693	A brand new Super Nintendo player for it.
2467893	2473576	But honestly, emulation on the DS is tough, especially when you have to get all those external cards and whatnot.
2475585	2477386	Antlion Trooper's Deuce Antlion Trooper's Deuce
2500100	2501702	The Cardboard Showdown with Cardboard Tube Samurai
2523061	2525603	Oh god, I can't remember what game it's for now.
2526003	2527184	Unreal Tournament, that's right.
2527784	2533208	And you can check this out at ObeyTheTube.com Very cool, very cool.
2533248	2534648	Thank you for following up on the mods, that's cool.
2535029	2537470	A couple quick news items here, then we're going to get to the advice column.
2538491	2543434	The Matrix Online is going down from nine servers to three.
2543794	2546196	They're scaling back to three servers starting August 2nd.
2547699	2551160	I don't know, that's probably a sign that it's not doing as well as they thought it would.
2551180	2557701	Yeah, they said that the reason why they're scaling back is because there wasn't a lot of players on it one time or whatever, so they're cutting them back.
2558061	2561622	Two of the servers are going to be standard servers, one of them is going to be a PvP server.
2561862	2568803	That's kind of sad to hear that Matrix Online, or the Matrix franchise in general has just been going downhill.
2568823	2576165	Well, I don't know, maybe their servers can handle more people, and so they want more people cramped into the city, because the city was huge, so it might just be the world's too big.
2576701	2576781	D.D.R.
2603408	2604829	Namco Museum 50th Anniversary Arcade Collection
2626625	2627246	to go with this game.
2627266	2642454	They're going to license Come On Eileen, Loverboy's Working for the Weekend, Fine Young Cannibals, She Drives Me Crazy, The Romantics with Talking in Your Sleep, and Daz Band's Joystick are just some of the titles that are being announced for the upcoming Namco Museum.
2642554	2644735	And by the way, Namco Museum is going to be a budget title.
2644775	2646156	It's going to be out for only $19.95.
2648337	2652519	But my question... Where's Pac-Man Fever in all of this?
2653940	2654380	Where is it?
2656258	2658440	The quintessential Namco 80s tune, come on people.
2660622	2662304	Oh yes, let's get to the one and only.
2662464	2677539	Actually, speaking of Namco, there was a 7-Up commercial in the 80s where someone was playing Pac-Man and it played this song that sounds almost like Betty Davis' eyes, except it's Pac-Man chasing the ghost, stopping, getting all out of breath, dehydrated, and drinking a 7-Up on screen.
2679145	2681426	Can you download that on one of those retro commercial websites?
2682006	2687289	I think so, but I think my fiance has it on his computer, which is still not hooked up because our house is still being unpacked.
2687949	2690811	But if I can, I'll try to rip the audio out of it.
2691011	2691451	That would be cool.
2692311	2692752	All right.
2693412	2698654	Now, we here at Orange Lounge Radio, we're not just here to talk about video games all day long, which should be pretty evident tonight.
2699175	2701396	But we're here to better your lives as well.
2702016	2708159	Because if we stayed home and played video games all day long, we'd have no time to go out and film commercials.
2709554	2711315	Which we've never done, but I just thought I'd throw that out there.
2711575	2712115	We were willing to.
2712695	2714196	It was nicer than what I was thinking.
2715056	2715636	What were you thinking?
2717337	2717637	Forget it.
2719638	2721698	It's DarkSakura's advice column, you know it by now.
2721718	2723039	What are you going to talk to us about tonight?
2724019	2727340	Tonight's bit of advice is how to escape from a sinking car.
2727940	2728201	Okay.
2729521	2732702	This is like if you happen to drive your car off into the river or something.
2734303	2734883	Number one.
2735589	2737510	Open the window as soon as possible.
2738050	2740891	Opening the window allows water to come in and equalize the pressure.
2741912	2740891	2.
2742412	2744553	If you cannot roll your windows down, break the glass.
2744673	2752536	Use your foot, shoulder, or heavy objects such as an anti-theft steering wheel lock, the club, the cops say use it, to escape from your car when it's underwater.
2752777	2753137	Interesting.
2753877	2753137	3.
2754617	2755678	Get out as soon as you can.
2756178	2759359	Floating time will range from a few seconds to a few minutes.
2759379	2759359	4.
2761500	2765082	If you are unable to open the window or break it, wait until the car fills with water.
2765916	2768537	When the water level reaches your head, take a deep breath and hold it.
2768918	2773220	Now the pressure should be equalized inside and outside, and you should be able to open the door and swim to the surface.
2775081	2782385	But, you know, my number one thing is, you know, you know, don't drive after having that adios motherfucker.
2783966	2784826	I had one of those.
2785486	2786607	You don't drive after that.
2787387	2788528	You will end up in the bay.
2788948	2794251	Yeah, don't drive into the bay, people, unless you're playing Driver 3, because that's about the only fun thing to do in that game.
2794987	2801474	And just in, I should go ahead and now, since it's very obvious that I have a source for my advice.
2803155	2806879	The Worst Case Scenario Survival Handbook is a wonderful thing.
2807179	2814046	It teaches you all kinds of ways to keep from getting trapped in an elevator and controlling runaway camels.
2814522	2814902	Very nice.
2814962	2816103	They sell a calendar or something?
2816363	2817024	I have a calendar.
2817224	2819325	We should really plug them so they don't sue you.
2819565	2822907	Yeah, I've been getting my advice, but this is all stuff I knew anyway.
2824548	2824848	Okay.
2825469	2828751	You never know when you have to cross a piranha-infested river, okay?
2829269	2830830	or Navigate a Minefield.
2830930	2835975	I'm going to laugh one of these days when someone actually... I was on this runaway camel and you saved my life.
2836115	2837336	Thank you, Orange Lounge.
2837376	2844562	You know, I'm waiting for the podcast alley votes this month because we usually have a couple people that leave these smart-ass comments that say, like, Orange Lounge taught me how to have a baby.
2844882	2847004	And, like, all these crazy things, which is cool.
2847024	2850967	So I'm looking forward to seeing those types of things come up this next month when people can vote again.
2851208	2852189	Yes, vote for us.
2852889	2853089	Vote.
2853990	2854891	Every second.
2855683	2856263	Moving on.
2857344	2859125	Rumble Roses XX.
2859985	2860585	That's right.
2860866	2864007	It's a sequel to Rumble Roses and it's coming out on the Xbox 360.
2864147	2865688	Hmm.
2866088	2869030	Why didn't they call this Rumble Roses XXXG?
2869130	2870850	Let me think about this one for a little bit.
2871030	2872991	Because that's basically what it will be.
2874697	2875778	I saw pictures.
2876238	2876899	It's pretty.
2877119	2878360	It's going to be customizable.
2878600	2881001	None of the existing characters will be replaced.
2881401	2886125	Fans of the series should check out changes to the known roster before inquiring about new characters.
2886185	2889367	So they're going to kind of change, but none of the characters are leaving, supposedly.
2889387	2890768	So it should be very interesting.
2891148	2892609	It needs customizable characters.
2892909	2896191	They're saying, though, that they're not thinking about mud wrestling.
2896251	2898613	They want to do something else that's stunning.
2898793	2899994	So I guess they haven't thought of it yet.
2900014	2900114	Okay.
2901054	2901795	Cream Corn!
2901815	2902995	Cream Corn!
2903495	2904396	Kids, Cream Corn.
2905576	2906697	Braun Panty Match.
2907878	2909398	Wasn't that what the whole game was?
2910239	2913700	Anyway, it's a completely different side of the spectrum here.
2914081	2921864	WB Interactive will be putting out a game on consoles and PC, and it's called Friends, the one with all the trivia.
2922205	2926207	That's right, it's a game dedicated to Friends trivia.
2926307	2927187	Yes, I saw this.
2928488	2928888	It's sad.
2930546	2932347	Joey is your best friend.
2932627	2933127	Moving on.
2933167	2935589	You will make him a ham sandwich every morning.
2935609	2937009	Please watch Joey.
2937130	2938650	Somebody, please watch it.
2938830	2941572	And buy him hundreds of dollars in pants.
2942993	2946895	I'm sorry, that's the only episode I remember was the Subliminal Message episode.
2947055	2948155	I remember Smelly Cat.
2948175	2948636	That's about it.
2948716	2950457	But I don't want to give that show any more time on this show.
2952222	2952762	Midway!
2952882	2955003	Midway's putting out a sequel to The Suffering.
2955063	2958605	It's a sequel to the popular shooter called The Suffering, The Ties That Bind.
2958905	2963087	And they just wanted to let you all know that they landed some major Hollywood talent to be doing the voice acting.
2963467	2964928	Michael Clarke Duncan.
2965268	2968589	Remember that guy who was in The Green Mile and The Planet of the Apes and Daredevil?
2968889	2971410	He will be doing a villainous character in the game.
2972011	2979914	And Rachel Griffiths, who is in Six Feet Under and Hillary and Jackie and probably nobody that listens to this show remembers this movie, but I remember her at Muriel's wedding.
2980838	2983059	She's going to be doing a role in this as well.
2983139	2985761	So some big Hollywood talent coming to The Suffering.
2985941	2991324	Might add also The Suffering starts in three different ways depending on how you ended the first game.
2992885	2996007	Or The Suffering starts if you choose to buy a Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen game instead.
2997788	2998208	Bad joke.
2998228	2999428	Forget it.
2999468	3001109	DarkSakura, you had another story for us?
3002150	3002750	I sure do.
3004531	3006392	I actually wanted Yahoo!
3006512	3009254	UK put up the top 100 computer games of all time.
3009990	3010571	Ah, very interesting.
3010591	3013313	Well, now we don't have time to read all 100, but... But I'll give you the top 10.
3013393	3014253	Alright, top 10 works.
3014774	3021199	Number 10, Elite for the BBC Micro, which is a system I need to get because I don't have one anymore.
3021319	3022820	I hope I will have heard of some of these games.
3023260	3024961	Sorry, UK listeners, I just don't know that one.
3025001	3025802	It's very Vectory.
3026142	3026402	Okay.
3026843	3029805	Then we have GoldenEye 007 for the Nintendo 64.
3029845	3030526	I know that one.
3030726	3033228	That game makes me violently motion sick.
3033368	3035389	But for shooter fans, great game.
3036290	3039072	It was a great game, but it did make me violently motion sick.
3039847	3041688	Next up, we have Street Fighter 2.
3043129	3044070	Okay, definitely.
3044090	3044610	Arcade version.
3044710	3046311	Revolutionized arcades, absolutely.
3046951	3049493	Super Mario Kart for the Super Nintendo.
3050494	3051114	Old favorite of mine.
3051194	3051414	Love it.
3052275	3054876	Monkey Island 2, LeChuck's Revenge for the PC.
3055156	3055537	Hell yeah.
3055697	3057378	That's an interesting one to have in the top ten.
3057458	3059739	A good choice, but that's kind of like that.
3059879	3060760	Well, that's number five.
3060940	3061740	Okay, what else?
3061860	3065262	Number four, Legend of Zelda Ocarina of Time for the Nintendo 64.
3065342	3065563	Okay.
3067225	3070507	I know the hate mail is going to come in, but Ocarina of Time was not as great of a game as everybody says.
3070527	3070948	Yes, it was.
3071228	3072068	No, it wasn't.
3072409	3075050	The Super Nintendo one was leaps and bounds better, in my opinion.
3075431	3077993	But maybe I just can't get the 3D Zelda thing.
3078053	3078913	I don't know.
3078953	3079814	Actually, I apologize.
3079834	3080594	That one was number five.
3080894	3081355	Oh, sorry.
3081915	3083957	And listeners, never mind Rob, because he's on crack.
3084097	3084357	Shut up.
3085338	3085918	Hated it.
3086759	3087919	Super Nintendo one was the best.
3087959	3088219	Shut up.
3088360	3088660	Moving on.
3089120	3089701	Number four.
3089821	3092903	Pro Evolution Soccer 4 on the PlayStation 2, put out by Konami.
3093323	3094644	Whoa, soccer and not football?
3097368	3098268	Your mic's going out again.
3098288	3098909	I don't know what's going on.
3098929	3099129	Sorry.
3099389	3102790	Konami published it with Sakura in the title, but it is football.
3103250	3103510	Okay.
3104990	3107431	Number three, Pokemon Red and Green.
3108931	3109351	All right.
3109892	3110692	Okay.
3110732	3113092	There's a big audience for that, and it reaches a lot of people.
3113413	3114073	Pokey Pokey.
3116213	3116693	Top two.
3117334	3120254	Number two, Super Mario 64 for the Nintendo 64.
3121215	3122195	That game was fun.
3122737	3126600	Again, the most overrated... This is the thing with Nintendo 64 games.
3126741	3129163	Their franchise games were incredibly overrated, in my opinion.
3129203	3130064	Goldeneye was a good game.
3130084	3131305	I like how it's described.
3132165	3136990	It says they're a childhood hero able to go anywhere and do anything to an extent that is purely magical.
3138431	3141674	And doesn't hold a candle to Mario 3, but that's just my big, fat opinion.
3143135	3146078	The number one game of all time... Tetris for the Game Boy.
3152092	3155473	No Pac-Man anywhere in the top ten, which is considered the granddaddy.
3155493	3157514	However, DDR was number 49.
3157934	3158415	Interesting.
3159195	3164797	All right, well, Tetris... And it was right above Afterburner, which I honestly like better than DDR.
3164857	3168398	Everybody plays Tetris, so I can't argue with that as the number one choice.
3168419	3168899	I really can't.
3169179	3171320	Tetris is the ultimate game to take on an airplane.
3172060	3172300	All right.
3173040	3174521	Couple more stories for you guys.
3175652	3175932	Codemasters
3190908	3191349	Carameldansen
3212290	3216793	on the product, and Konami is bringing a good game to the American Idol name.
3217874	3224959	Now, they're not confirming that it's going to be a karaoke revolution marriage, the American Idol game, but come on, what else is it going to be, people?
3224979	3225939	It's going to be karaoke.
3225979	3227440	It's got to be some type of karaoke.
3227480	3231043	And then you're going to see DDR, Think You Can Dance.
3231183	3232284	Please, please, no.
3233465	3234385	End there, end there.
3235006	3235866	It's going to happen.
3236226	3239048	All right, and... Wow.
3239769	3239869	Um...
3241636	3242336	All right, moving on.
3243497	3244157	Field of Magic.
3245258	3246399	You remember that game on the DS?
3246879	3251561	It's kind of like a dating sim type game, but it was like WarioWare mixed with Sprung, I guess you could say.
3252082	3257765	Field of Magic, even though it wasn't the most hugely popular game, it's actually getting a sequel.
3258425	3263548	Famitsu Magazine mentions that Field of Magic XXYY is going to be getting a sequel.
3263968	3265249	Guess what the sequel is called?
3265749	3267670	This is all we know about the game so far is the name.
3268945	3271447	Akachan wa doko karakuru no?
3271687	3273809	Which means, where do babies come from?
3276431	3279554	Uh, yeah.
3282096	3283237	Where do babies come from?
3284018	3284658	Anyway, um...
3289571	3291872	You got another quick story before I get to tonight's last story?
3291972	3303599	Like I hinted at earlier about the Nintendogs thing, selected members of Nintendo.com who are registered there will receive their copies of Nintendog on August 22nd.
3304280	3307181	Or before the August 22nd release date, actually.
3307902	3315446	And rumor is it's probably going to be the people that have the most usage of their forms.
3315606	3317388	Lucky you people.
3317528	3318068	Send me a copy.
3319972	3334041	and also one more thing and it's not too much of a surprise since there's a lot of instant messaging on the Xbox 360 they're going to have a QWERTY controller as well one of those ones with a stupid little keyboard on the bottom fun fun interesting
3334895	3336596	All right, one more story for you guys tonight.
3336656	3337997	I promised you a Mac story.
3338198	3339038	Here's your Mac story.
3339579	3343602	If you are a OSX user, you must check this out.
3344022	3353249	MikeZornik.com, that's M-I-K-E-Z-O-R-N-E-K.com slash Coco, C-O-C-O-A, slash Mega Man Effect.
3353850	3362697	And what this is, this is an application so that when you launch an icon in OSX, it actually does the Mega Man Effect from Mega Man 2.
3368476	3370417	So it's gonna be like, calculator!
3370617	3371218	Exactly.
3371418	3377882	So every time you launch an application, the icon comes out, and you get the little Mega Man 2 anthem.
3377942	3381825	Oh my god, that'd be so annoying, but I gotta put, I would totally put that on my computer at home.
3382445	3383946	Are you saying you're gonna buy a Mac?
3383966	3385547	I'm not gonna buy a Mac for that.
3385667	3386648	Fuck that, he'll port it.
3388709	3390591	Alright, that would be so annoying.
3391471	3392652	They should do that with everything.
3392712	3393793	Hamburger!
3393813	3394173	Dude!
3396701	3397402	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3421525	3422045	Wow!
3422325	3423325	Hey, guess what?
3423545	3424366	Who's at the door?
3424686	3425666	It's Pizza Man!
3431787	3432447	Mailman!
3432527	3433067	No!
3435428	3436008	Okay, God.
3436228	3436588	All right.
3436868	3439129	And now it's time for the final thoughts.
3440329	3441129	All right, just kidding.
3441169	3441769	Just kidding, people.
3442129	3443650	All right, Loki, your final thought.
3443950	3450691	My final thought is I must play more Star Soldier, and goddammit, they better have my copy of Graffiti Kingdom.
3451598	3454299	DarkSakura, besides getting your mic fixed, what's your final thought?
3454959	3459620	Sometimes, the reason why I say I don't play any games during the week is because I have a life!
3460580	3462200	I work and I go to college!
3462320	3462840	Sue me!
3463020	3464641	Somebody ruffled your feathers this week, didn't we?
3467061	3473362	And my final thought, I'm hungry, so I'm going to go have a pizza.
3473983	3475783	Maybe you should call the pizza man!
3477568	3478188	Goodbye, everybody.
3478208	3479188	Thanks for tuning in.
3479288	3480649	See you next time on the Orange Line.
3480689	3482729	You guys are going to do a cast next week, right?
3482989	3483409	Ow!
3483649	3484149	Okay.
3485269	3487230	Your table got all GTA on my elbow.
3487270	3488850	She got beat up by Pizza Man.
3491650	3492651	Put down the joke.
3492751	3494051	Step away from the joke.
3495711	3498112	Hey, at least it's not, you know, cake pie anymore.
3498192	3500252	You guys are going to be here next week even though I'm not, right?
3500392	3500652	Yes.
3500932	3504213	We will be taking over the podcast.
3504313	3505713	That should be interesting.
3507054	3508955	It'll be anger chat for 30 minutes.
3509216	3511197	You know, I could always call in on Skype or something.
3512378	3513759	We could always set you on fire.
3514179	3516701	Until next time, boys and girls.
3518122	3521705	That's the end of another Orange Lounge Radio To Go edition.
3522005	3528990	This podcast is a proud part of www.orangeloungeradio.com See you next update.
