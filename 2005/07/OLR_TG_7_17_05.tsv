29093	29833	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
59178	60699	That's a good description.
60939	62641	Has the fan mail perked you up at all?
62781	64262	You get more fan mail than any of us.
64802	65443	You know what?
65603	67304	Wait, did you see that?
67324	68165	She just perked up.
68185	69526	All of a sudden, she's full of life.
69546	70286	She's like, yay!
70967	71487	Fan mail.
71928	76211	Well, I have this sort of complex about myself where I'm like...
77579	80960	Eh, that's nice, but I don't deserve it, you know?
81220	82061	You do, though.
82141	83901	You're a good gal.
83961	85442	I can't be the diva all the time.
85462	87863	I have to be modest on occasion.
88303	89723	Maybe I want to be the diva, dammit.
89743	90404	Somebody send me a fan letter.
90424	91264	You can't be the diva.
93291	93892	Oh, girl.
93912	95132	There could be only one.
95373	96233	There could be only one.
96313	98775	Yeah, I'm going to be the diva just tonight.
98815	101056	I'm kind of... All right.
101257	102818	How's the new Harry Potter book going for you?
102958	104059	I'm about halfway through it right now.
104239	106480	Dang, you people read that book very fast.
106500	108161	I haven't had a whole bunch of time to read it.
108201	110603	This is only actually the equivalent of four hours reading.
111203	111524	Wow.
112204	114646	So which Harry Potter book does he go through puberty?
115248	116249	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
139079	139920	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
155780	171925	Quidditch Quidditch, whatever, Quidditch, Quidditch I thought it was kind of crap But I played one where Harry was just kind of walking around I think it was Azkaban, I don't remember But it was kind of cool, it was okay I kind of like exploring all the places and doing the stuff I just wish, you know what would be cool?
171945	183129	It would be like an MMORPG For the Harry Potter universe You know it'll happen I will be on that so fast We're going to talk about another MMO potential For lots of fanboys and girls tonight on the show
183928	184188	All right.
184769	185029	What?
185549	185849	What?
187590	189451	You're thinking the Oregon Trail thing, aren't you?
189472	191633	Oregon Trail, the MMORPG.
192694	194855	It's a reference to our three-hour show earlier this evening.
194875	196756	Which you should all be listening to as well.
196956	199298	One of our callers brought up Oregon Trail, the MMO.
199498	200278	It should be a great idea.
200298	202700	We're going to start an online petition and everything, so we'll see.
204341	208804	Speaking of online things, did you know that we got nominated for the Podcast Awards?

259989	261450	What games have you been playing this week, DarkSakura?
262471	263011	Hardly any.
263492	268055	I played PSO once, and that's really about it.
268335	272938	Oh, no, I played Guitar Man today on my 50-inch widescreen HDTV.
273779	278262	It was like my entire range of vision was Guitar Man, and I suck at that game.
279703	283406	The Parapara level kicked my ass, and it's only the second level.
284824	286545	Guitaroman is a very strange music game.
286585	287145	It's very different.
287466	294690	The analog, like, in Guitaroman, of course, you're trying to play the guitar, and there's this one point where you move the analog stick very carefully, and you try to trace the pattern.
295350	296411	It's harder than you'd think.
297071	300494	At least for me, but maybe I just have a fat thumb or something.
300514	303415	It's my first time actually playing the game, and I've owned it for two years.
304716	304956	Wow.
305116	306037	I unwrapped it last year.
308032	309254	Thank you for watching!
323214	326076	Namco Battle Collection I've been testing out, which has been pretty cool.
327077	330880	Definitely got all your retro favorites in there, plus the remade ones are really nice.
331360	332961	Like the remade ones from the early 90s?
333462	336884	Like Pac-Man and Rally-X and stuff they had in the arcades?
337284	338465	No, these weren't in the arcades.
338485	341147	These were made specifically for the PSP.
341427	343789	They're really nice, they look pretty, and they play well.
344190	344650	So that's good.
344730	346171	I like retro upgrades.
346271	348052	I always liked Mario Lost Levels.
348293	348773	Or not Mario...
349033	350054	Mario All-Stars
366019	367480	It's with a K. Okay, good.
367680	369121	K-O-L-L-O-N.
369141	369361	Oh, good.
369581	370481	Because I could just see those chips.
370501	374103	I've been playing Colon, and it was pretty cool, and I've been trying that out and stuff.
374403	376424	Wait, wait, so a puzzle game you like on PSP?
376444	376604	Yeah.
376844	377465	Imagine that.
377625	379346	There's really a lot of puzzle games coming out.
379366	386289	We got bashed on Mercury and Smart Bomb, so... Well, Mercury sucked, and Smart Bomb was not even finished.
386809	388430	You know, whatever.
388570	389671	I mean, they just sucked.
389711	390011	But anyways...
390413	394295	I've been trying those, and then playing a little bit of Coated Arms and stuff, and it was pretty fun.
394835	398776	So, yeah, just trying out the PSP games and stuff, whatever I can get my hands on.
399737	400297	Well, go figure.
400317	402458	While Loki's been playing PSP, I've been playing DS.
402538	404158	I played two new DS games this week.
404699	414662	First one I checked out was Puyo Puyo, the new DS version of Puyo Puyo, which it kind of did... For those of you guys that have played Puyo Puyo before, you might have played it and not even known it, because it was called...
416713	424399	Sonic, or no, Dr. Robotnik's Magic Bean Machine on Genesis, and then on Super Nintendo, it was Kirby's Avalanche.
424739	425339	Woo, I remembered.
425399	426060	Kirby's Avalanche.
426560	428582	Both of them were just different versions of Puyo Puyo.
428902	435787	Well, they have this game now in its original kind of Japanese anime form on the DS, but they kind of changed the game a little bit.
435807	442512	They changed some of the mechanics, like they put fat pieces in them, like pieces that would usually be like, think of Super Gems from Puzzle Fighter 2.
443312	466353	That fall, like big red, they're like 2x2s, they're just like fat red pieces and stuff, you know, different colors So they changed some of the game mechanics, you know, keep it a little bit fresh Some of the rest of the game, though, is a little bit dorky Like they have the cutscenes where they're talking to each other and it's all anime style So they're all like cute little girls talking like this Except they talk very slow when they do their talking
466758	484035	so you know you're like sitting waiting waiting and it's kind of like why is it in a lot of these games when they're talking to each other back and forth they don't talk normally they slow down their speech like they're reading it line by line why is that so I don't know
484485	484725	Puyo Puyo
507210	507730	Loving this.
507930	511811	The new DS games are starting to be eight-player games off of one cartridge.
512071	514992	Bomberman, Meteos, not necessarily eight players, but four, you know.
515912	516392	Loving that.
516472	521933	So I'm very happy to report that Puyo Puyo does the multi-player off one cartridge as well.
521973	522393	That's great.
523314	529135	Also, another DS game I checked out this week was Kirby's Canvas Curse, which has actually been out for about a month now, but I got it for my birthday.
529255	529755	Thank you, Loki.
530379	540558	I have to admit, I didn't want to play this game at first because I had a bad feeling it was going to be like Yoshi Touch and Go, which if you listened to earlier podcasts, I did not like Yoshi Touch and Go.
540578	541580	I thought it was way too...
542264	543365	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
567071	574296	You will like Kirby's Canvas Curse because there's way more interactivity and there's so many different levels and things to unlock.
574716	578459	And if you're a Kirby fan, you're going to like it because it has the old music and the cute graphics.
578739	581861	But please note, this does not play like a normal Kirby game.
581901	583042	That's one thing you want to keep in mind.
583422	596891	It's Kirby Canvas Curse and basically Kirby sort of moves automatically and you can touch him with a stylus to make him roll faster or if he's killed an enemy, you can use the power like if you hit one of the stone guys, then tapping on Kirby will make him turn into a stone.
597371	599872	but it doesn't function like the other ones.
599892	603433	You don't suck in the enemies using your breath like you did in the old Kirby games.
603813	607074	It doesn't quite have that same gameplay element.
607094	616616	The gameplay is much different because you're drawing paths for Kirby to take, which I know sounds very simple, but it's actually kind of complicated and the level design is pretty smart in the game.
616996	619277	So I guess that's kind of my review.
619317	621897	If you like Kirby the character, you'll like this game.
621937	623838	If you like Kirby the actual game,
624358	630143	You may want to rent or borrow this one first to make sure that the mechanics of the game are going to be something you enjoy.
630443	632405	But if you liked Touch and Go, you're going to like this one.
633225	634686	So that's my thought on Kirby Canvas Curse.
634706	638870	I forgot to mention, I also played one more game called Glow Race Fantastic Carnival.
639350	642393	It's some racing game that's in Korea for the PSP.
643233	643694	I don't like it.
644134	644494	It was lame.
645535	646236	I'm sorry to hear that.
646636	650719	It's like a cheap version of Mario Kart that's not even close to being Mario Kart and just lame.
651140	652581	I can't wait for Mario Kart DS, though.
653567	656989	You know Mario Kart DS and Animal Crossing DS are going to have the online thing.
657109	658370	At least that's what they're saying right now.
658510	658910	I hope so.
659030	659950	I can't wait for that.
660151	661131	Well, you know it's going to happen.
661151	662072	They were showing it off at E3.
662452	670476	But what's interesting is that 1UP.com ran a story this week about Metroid Prime Hunters not having the online capability.
670516	674738	And just kind of, why didn't, you know, because this game's been delayed and delayed over and over again.
675119	677920	Why didn't they bother to add in the online capability?
677940	678500	Because think about it.
678540	681162	Metroid Prime Hunters would have been a lot of fun online.
681842	683283	And there's some quotes in the articles here.
683944	691930	The producer of the game, Kensuke Tanabe, says, Really, we could have made this game online, but Nintendo's version of online play is different from that of other companies.
692390	695612	We wanted it to be free, easy, and easy to access for everybody.
695913	701637	To set up the kind of infrastructure that we needed, and to meet the launch date we have for this game, the two just didn't match.
702942	705824	And that makes me think, what was the launch date for this game?
705844	708745	Because, dang, it's been like a year since the DS came out.
708945	710346	Well, okay, maybe not quite that long.
710366	711206	It feels like a year.
711586	715588	In reality, it's probably been, what, eight months or so since DS came out?
716068	722652	And Prime Hunters was the built-in demo, and I would think that the built-in demo would be the game that would be coming out within the first three months.
723292	724953	Unless it was just one hell of a teaser.
725693	727494	That's what it basically ended up being.
728014	733596	And of course, then they kind of, you know, try to soften the blow here about Metroid Prime Hunters not being online.
734076	740958	Richard Verrotti, game designer over at Nintendo, says, I don't think we look at it as a negative thing because we're not focusing on the internet.
740978	744379	We've got to focus on the Wi-Fi stuff so four players can jump in like that.
744739	748460	And if only one person has the game, well, you can download it too and then play with your friends.
748800	751141	I think it's going to be the perfect multiplayer game because of that.
752270	753531	and I'll give them points for that.
753651	762639	I do like the fact on the DS you really get to sample a lot of games because it seems to be this running trend in a lot of games where you can play off of one cartridge and that at least is cool.
763600	765421	But the internet thing would have been cool.
765461	768144	I would have liked to play some of our podcast listeners on the internet.
768504	769345	Metroid Maker
790905	791606	Oh, like make your own?
791946	797010	Someone had done a map editor for Metroid, and someone has actually made a Metroid game out of it.
797030	797750	Like a ROM hack thing?
798451	798831	Sort of.
799111	799512	That's cool.
800733	801413	I love Super Metroid.
801453	807217	I did not get into the 3D Metroids as much, but I love the DS one.
808238	810820	For some reason, the 3D thing works for me on that.
810880	811361	I don't know why.
811401	814863	It doesn't look nearly as good as it does on GameCube, but for some reason, I like it.
815003	816384	I don't know what it is.
816685	817025	Go figure.
818427	820088	Alright, so what do you guys think?
820388	821588	Online play on DS?
822028	825190	Something that more games should be looking at doing?
825350	829251	Let's see how these early ones do first before we start going.
829311	832793	Let's get more online play because if it's going to suck, then no.
833193	833433	Alright.
834141	838503	We got a couple letters tonight sent to us via togo at orangeloungeradio.com.
838524	840645	That's T-O-G-O at orangeloungeradio.com.
840685	841885	So I thought we'd read a couple letters.
842566	845828	Unfortunately, we're getting a lot of mail, so we don't have time to answer everything.
845928	847989	But DarkSakura, she does check that mailbox.
848429	852331	I'd reply to my mailbox, but all I'm getting is spam.
853112	854853	You need breast enhancement.
855856	859057	Apparently I do, because there's a lot of people sending me that info.
859297	862317	I still like that one webcomic you linked me to, Rob.
862998	863578	Spamusement.
863598	864878	That's hilarious.
865098	866298	I love Spamusement.
866398	869419	Seriously, I think it's the best webcomic out there.
869839	870579	And it's so simple.
870759	873240	Spamusement.com gets my full endorsement.
873260	873820	I love that site.
873900	875300	Alright, let's open up the mailbag.
879681	880281	Let's see.
880401	882021	We got a fan letter here.
882502	884062	I'm going to read the Loki fan letter here.
885185	886406	This was from Same.
887466	894890	Same says he was catching up on some of the old podcasts while cleaning up around my room, and I was listening to the July 4th podcast, and I must say the following words.
895230	895890	I loved it.
896311	897171	I am so serious.
897331	900953	Loki was hilarious, and I couldn't stop laughing every time he spoke.
901013	901633	Do it some more.
904955	905975	Seriously, guys.
906856	908316	That game was awful.
908657	908957	Seriously.
908997	909417	Seriously.
910158	911159	It was really awful.
911259	913380	Seriously, it was awful.
913780	917462	Loki, next time he drinks, he's going to be under strict monitoring when he drinks.
917762	919063	He barfed on the carpet.
919223	920143	It was disgusting.
920303	922825	I had 20 shots of vodka.
922925	923805	I mean, what do you expect?
923865	925646	You need to be babysat next time you get drunk.
925906	927747	I thought it was a single shot glass.
927927	929908	Drink responsibly, boys and girls.
930969	931749	I didn't even think about it.
932748	934829	Alright, let's get to another letter here.
935209	938111	This one is from... Does this person have a handle?
938351	939272	I couldn't see it in here.
939672	941153	Sorry if you had a handle and I missed it.
941733	946556	This is from Brett, and Brett wants to know, I played Silent Hill 1 and 2.
946976	949817	I thought the second game was one of the best games available at the time.
950218	954320	I absolutely love Silent Hill 2, and then Silent Hill 3 popped its ugly head.
955120	959683	I wasn't feeling the 17-year-old life-vesting wearing chick, and the game was a bit boring to me.
959743	961284	I think I played about two hours of it.
961764	964566	My question is, Silent Hill 4, is it worth checking out?
964967	966308	I know that the movie is coming out soon.
966368	967769	It's been a hot topic on the show.
968129	970691	So Silent Hill 4 is the only one of the series I haven't played yet.
970771	971892	Should I give it a whirl?
972413	973233	That's from Brett.
973273	973994	What do you guys think?
974314	975395	Definitely.
975976	976436	Definitely.
976916	977437	You think so?
977577	978057	It's pretty good.
978518	979799	What do you think, DarkSakura?
980359	981680	You've had my copy of Silent Hill 4.
981720	982361	I hope you've played it.
982721	983702	Well, I have my own copy.
983722	984783	I thought I gave you yours back.
985423	985864	I don't know.
986124	987885	Well, I'll find it sometime when I unpack.
988226	988626	That's cool.
989166	989747	What do you think, though?
989767	990948	Would you recommend Silent Hill 4?
991752	993594	Well, yeah.
994615	1002303	First of all, in my response that I had given back, I would say I told them to try Silent Hill 3 all the way through because it really does get a lot better.
1003143	1009770	But Silent Hill 4 is definitely from a male perspective and it's very, I think, unique to the series.
1010371	1010711	Very cool.
1013070	1014871	I would definitely recommend Silent Hill 4.
1015591	1018093	To be honest, I haven't even really played Silent Hill 3.
1020034	1020714	I'm liking it.
1020774	1021755	I really like Silent Hill 3.
1022395	1028999	Silent Hill 4 is a continuation of the story from Silent Hill 2, so I don't see how it could really be a miss.
1029259	1031020	I love the soundtrack especially.
1031060	1033702	The soundtrack, I think, is one of the best parts of the whole game.
1033762	1034943	That's what I love about it.
1036864	1037685	At least rent it.
1037945	1039227	Do yourself a favor, rent it.
1039587	1042851	I think the idea of renting games is really great, so definitely check that out.
1043922	1047023	All right, and then one other letter we got from Mark.
1048124	1052245	And Mark actually lives in the UK and sent us a really great email.
1052265	1055626	It was so great, but it was kind of long, so I can't read the whole thing.
1055726	1058287	But it's a follow-up to last week's podcast.
1058307	1060188	Remember how we were talking about the rating system?
1060548	1063769	And I said that they should do it like they do the movies.
1064189	1068651	Well, in here, Mark writes, well, this is how it's done in the UK to an extent.
1069071	1084922	Game ratings in most of Europe are given out by the Pan-European Gaming Information, that's www.pegi.info, with ratings including 3+, 7+, 12, 16, and 18 printed on the boxes for each game, and often also accompanied by icons to describe the reasons for these ratings.
1085883	1091366	Although I don't believe the ratings are legally binding, retailers do tend to enforce the 16 and 18 ratings.
1091847	1094849	Also, most retailers will not stock a game without a PEGI rating,
1095250	1098464	Although, again, I don't think there's a legal requirement for them to do so.
1101129	1129084	and then went on to say the ratings tend to be quite effective as the 15 and 18 ratings have been used on movies for a very long time so parents recognize the logos and understand the reasons for these ratings although then he linked us to an article that said that maybe the studies don't quite link up to that and then they were talking about, Mark was talking about the hysteria regarding hysteria about violent games in the UK a notable recent case involved a boy 14 getting murdered by an older teenager
1129444	1135851	It was reported that the older teenager had been inspired to kill the younger child by the gay Manhunt.
1141822	1144323	Very interesting to hear the UK perspective.
1144343	1149864	And then Mark ends his letter by saying, maybe everyone would be more mellow if Katamari Damacy ever came out over here.
1150004	1151905	And I didn't even realize that game wasn't out over there.
1152185	1153646	Neither did I. You need that game.
1153706	1154686	You guys need that game.
1154926	1156466	Import that stuff or something.
1156686	1160067	Well, I don't think they can because of the television difference, but... Hey, you know what?
1160127	1163568	A lot of TVs come out now able to switch between PAL and NTSC.
1163728	1164649	Figure out a way to do it.
1164769	1165509	You guys need that game.
1165529	1165829	You're right.
1165869	1167730	People would mellow out if they could play some Katamari Damacy.
1167770	1168850	Play it on a computer monitor.
1170019	1171520	No problem on a computer monitor.
1172281	1172561	All right.
1172601	1174402	Thank you very much, Mark, for your mail.
1174422	1175103	It was very nice.
1175283	1176364	I like getting the long mails.
1176464	1178305	It really shows they listen to us.
1178645	1179106	It's great.
1180086	1180347	All right.
1180387	1181848	So we're going to close up the mail bag again.
1181868	1185150	If you guys have an email, togo at orangelaunchradio.com.
1186680	1194464	The PlayStation 2 version of Grand Theft Auto San Andreas, it was confirmed by GameSpot that it does have the hot coffee content.
1195104	1200247	So that's interesting because as we were saying last week, you have to mod your game to do this.
1200327	1213494	But apparently a sequence of codes have been discovered or something that will actually unlock this in the PlayStation 2 version of the game, which kind of goes, well, now is this a case of Rockstar was just lazy and didn't take the code out?
1213514	1213554	No.
1213954	1221522	Well, apparently it could be like, you know, the code pointing to it or whatever could be like, you know, truncated out or something like that.
1221663	1226187	Like, they just put one code in there to patch, you know, to rewrite the code.
1227469	1231153	I mean, I don't see how they're guilty for having this code in there if it's disabled.
1231213	1233956	I mean, there's a lot of things that can be disabled in a game.
1234738	1235679	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1257865	1264912	And I can't say I blame them 100% because not everybody's a gamer, and I don't think there's any senators that are video gamers, although if there are, that would be cool, and I would vote for them.
1264972	1268136	She probably thinks that, you know, Bill Clinton slept with Monica.
1268156	1269677	Now, wait a minute, wait a minute.
1269717	1272520	Because he saw the whores in, you know, Grand Theft Auto.
1272540	1273081	Wait a minute.
1273101	1275022	Wait a minute, it has nothing to do with it.
1275943	1276344	Does it?
1277262	1288574	I think people are thinking that this is actually in the game and was something hidden by the people who coded it as some type of secret feature.
1289054	1291777	But that really doesn't seem to be the case when you look into it.
1291957	1292958	Oh, but do they do the research?
1293138	1293399	No!
1293859	1294640	That's the problem.
1294680	1297323	I think that's why this whole thing is blown out of proportion.
1297383	1299365	I don't think people have been doing the appropriate research.
1299745	1309684	and I'm hoping that that is the investigation they're going to do and that's what they're going to find out because what they want to find out did Rockstar release this game knowing that they were...
1310606	1316369	Marketing this as a mature game when it should have been adults only because this would be unlocked by somebody.
1316389	1317149	And I'm saying no.
1317269	1319230	Some hacker went and figured out a way to do it.
1319711	1326734	And Rockstar was under the impression that that wouldn't happen because they had removed the code that points to the hot coffee mug.
1327675	1328595	And did they?
1328755	1329376	I don't know.
1330854	1331495	Thank you for watching!
1346994	1351677	They want to see everything censored and everything, you know, hunky-dory Christian.
1352178	1357821	What I don't understand, this is something, you know, if you think about it, M would be like an R rating on a movie, right?
1357841	1360403	Because AO would be like the NC-17 rating, right?
1360843	1364766	And they want to say that this hot coffee mod should earn this game an adults-only rating.
1364866	1368329	But, my God, have you seen sex scenes in how many R-rated movies?
1368889	1371010	I mean, should that really qualify this game for an AO rating?
1371551	1371891	Granted...
1372906	1377851	Maybe I myself am being a little ignorant here because I have not seen the mod myself, but I'm assuming how bad can it be?
1377891	1379332	It's pixelated, for God's sake.
1379372	1380233	How bad can it be?
1380893	1381154	You know?
1382435	1382735	I don't know.
1382755	1389481	Well, it is pretty graphic, but it's not too graphic to the point where I'd say it'd be... Are there money shots?
1390181	1390842	No, there's...
1391637	1392857	There's pixelated boobies.
1393198	1395918	But still, look at God of War.
1396299	1398119	There's a sex minigame in that game.
1398919	1402220	And there's boobies that are not pixelated.
1402280	1403821	They're out there saying, hello.
1404241	1408903	And he basically says, hey, thanks to this group, get off my fucking boat.
1409043	1411823	And that game was an M-rated game, right?
1411903	1412404	Yes, it was.
1412864	1413604	And not AO.
1413884	1414384	Not AO.
1414524	1414964	Interesting.
1415965	1419326	It's because there's penetration in it or something.
1419366	1419446	Yeah.
1421405	1421826	Oh noes.
1422987	1427451	Anybody that's learned about the birds and the bees knows that when we're talking about sex, penetration's involved.
1428152	1430615	I mean, come on, there's a freaking dildo weapon in this game.
1430655	1430875	I mean...
1431542	1432523	Thank you for watching!
1452365	1453146	Grand Theft Auto
1477697	1483179	I realize that there's very mature 14, 15, 16 year olds out there that can probably handle it.
1483319	1486060	I know 14 year olds that are more mature than some 32 year olds I know.
1486080	1486381	Contract.
1486881	1487681	I think a contract.
1487921	1491123	Because when you're buying this for the fucking people, make them sign a contract.
1491183	1497025	If it's their parents buying it for them, say, I understand what is in this game and I understand it, blah, blah, blah, blah.
1497325	1502712	and then that way if their son goes and murders somebody and they blame it on Grand Theft Auto No, no, no, no, no!
1502732	1506056	Because you understood what you were getting into so that's your own damn fault.
1506437	1507138	Bad parent.
1507398	1507879	Bad.
1509661	1509981	Alright.
1512004	1513566	I'm sure we'll get some emails on that one.
1514195	1516958	Let's go to a happy, family-friendly story, shall we?
1516978	1518219	We'll talk about Worms!
1518920	1519700	A nice game about Worms.
1519961	1521902	Oh wait, these Worms have guns and blow each other up.
1521943	1523284	I guess this isn't so family-friendly.
1523484	1524065	I like Worms.
1524105	1526046	But Worms is coming to the PSP and DS.
1526387	1531532	I liked Worms when it was called Scorched Earth, and it was out on the PC like 10 years, 15 years ago.
1531912	1535416	By the way, Scorched Earth is actually being ported to the PSP.
1535556	1536056	It already has.
1536416	1536897	That's awesome.
1538423	1543227	THQ today announced that it will publish two new Worms games for the DS and the PSP.
1543287	1549212	No release date set yet, but is it really any surprise that Worms is coming out on the DS and the PSP?
1549332	1549733	Probably not.
1549873	1556118	I don't know, but THQ, I want my $5 back because the cell phone game version of Worms sucked ass.
1559161	1560222	I thought this was interesting.
1561187	1565168	Sega, it is rumored that their new arcade board is actually based on the Xbox 360.
1565268	1566589	Yeah, I heard that.
1566749	1574371	The distributors in Japan are saying that the Lindbergh system, which is Sega's new system, their new arcade board, it does use the 360 architecture.
1575051	1575692	Very interesting.
1575712	1583034	And this, by the way, would be the second time that a Microsoft console has been the inspiration for a Sega arcade cabinet.
1583493	1586674	The Chihiro board was based on the current Xbox.
1587074	1590914	You mean it's not the third time that that's happened since there's only even, I don't know, two systems?
1591634	1595815	So this logically can only be the second time?
1596015	1598676	Just reporting what's on the internet out there.
1599356	1600896	DarkSakura, you're a Sega fangirl.
1600916	1601636	What do you think of this one?
1602516	1608137	Sega teaming up with, well, not necessarily teaming up with Microsoft, but certainly using a lot of their stuff.
1609137	1612278	As long as they're using them and not climbing into bed with them, I'm happy.
1612658	1612858	You know,
1613627	1622631	It makes sense, though, because look at, like, for instance, I saw an article on Project Gotham Racing 3, near photorealistic imagery that's in that game.
1622711	1626032	I mean, it's just amazing just the quality graphics that can be pushed out by this board.
1626393	1628433	More power to them if they want to make an arcade game like that.
1628533	1630954	Wait a minute, did I just hear you say something nice about the Xbox?
1632055	1633496	Yes, about the Xbox 360.
1634816	1636477	Can somebody please note the date and time?
1637555	1638256	This is a miracle.
1638276	1638657	About the 360.
1639398	1645726	I still dislike the fact that one of the selling points is custom faceplates because that's retarded, but whatever.
1648210	1650653	It's aimed at that same market that watches Pimp My Ride.
1650673	1651194	What can I say?
1652432	1654833	Speaking of the Xbox 360, I have one more quick story on this.
1655693	1667397	Marvel said this week, and this is of course at the Comic Con convention, they unveiled this, they have an exclusive agreement with Microsoft to produce MMORPGs that will be on the Xbox 360.
1669697	1680380	Spider-Man, MMORPGs, Fantastic Four, X-Men, Iron Man, only on Xbox 360 and MMORPG 4.
1680580	1682560	It's going to be a Marvel Universe MMO.
1683200	1696203	This is no surprise because they actually filed lawsuits against the people that did the Super Heroes City of Heroes because of their character generator people were using to create likenesses of characters that looked
1696423	1697084	Very similar to this.
1697404	1704070	And they said that that would cause... That would kind of put a dent in the being able to create an MMO featuring Marvel characters.
1704570	1705851	So we knew this was coming.
1705891	1706832	But, yeah.
1707032	1708894	I mean, DC's doing theirs, so why not?
1709214	1711196	Sony Online is working with DC.
1711216	1713558	That was announced earlier, so that's just kind of interesting.
1714879	1717482	Yeah, you know, that's kind of what I thought when I first heard this.
1717502	1719383	I was like, don't we already have a game called City of Heroes?
1719844	1721465	So, you know, there's...
1722711	1722951	All right.
1723031	1723352	All right.
1748593	1754778	By the way, follow up to your lawsuit there, NCSoft had a little bit of a victory there because the judge threw out a lot of Marvel's complaints.
1754918	1756599	Just so you know.
1757880	1759161	Alright, moving on.
1759461	1761503	Loki, why don't you tell us what's going on in the Hack and Crack world?
1762364	1763064	Lots of stuff.
1763525	1765026	First off, PSP stuff.
1765086	1768769	They have released the brand new loader for the PSP
1770252	1774075	UMD RIPs, it's 2.5E or something like that.
1774095	1784843	It allows the new RIPs to play, or most of the games to play with Wi-Fi and sound, because I guess the PRX files, they're like these library files, kind of like on Windows, where you have to get a lot of files.
1784983	1792108	Anyway, library files are being loaded now, so you can do Wi-Fi in a lot of games, and you can also overclock the games as well, which was kind of neat.
1792889	1793730	So that was one of the things.
1793750	1798133	The other thing that came out, which was really cool, was the SCUMM VM PSP Beta.
1798793	1805799	and for those who don't know SCUM stands for um what was it it was uh oh man
1806178	1806618	I can't remember.
1806658	1815925	Anyways, it's the programming language that they use to write games like Maniac Mansion and Monkey Island and those wonderful games, LucasArts games.
1816366	1818547	Anyways, you can actually play these games now.
1818607	1822370	You can put this file on there and play all your PC games.
1822671	1823891	Those LucasArts games were awesome.
1823992	1825313	Yes, they were awesome.
1825633	1828195	So you can play those, and that was really cool.
1829796	1832118	Of course, also, the other thing that came out...
1834986	1837949	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1857445	1857765	Sounds good.
1882017	1884519	DarkSakura, what are you going to be giving us advice about tonight?
1912584	1914345	Some people may not want to escape when tied up.
1914445	1918007	Hey, we need to stay PG rated tonight.
1918127	1918407	Sorry.
1919227	1920588	Well, he already dropped the F-bomb.
1920928	1922469	Yeah, well, fuck what he did, okay?
1922729	1923449	Okay, sorry.
1924990	1929712	Number one, when your captors start binding you, expand your body as much as possible.
1930152	1933474	Take a deep breath, puff out your chest, and pull your shoulders back.
1934808	1936989	2.
1935468	1936989	Flex your arms against the bonds.
1937169	1938890	Push against the bonds as much as possible.
1939970	1938890	3.
1940470	1943051	Once your captors leave, suck in your chest and stomach.
1943071	1945192	Wriggle free with the extra room you have given yourself.
1945812	1947533	But my final bit of advice.
1948033	1948273	Yes.
1949574	1951655	This bondage party is sick, man.
1951715	1952095	Sick.
1955736	1956137	Alright.
1956797	1959598	And with that, DarkSakura, are you on your way out?
1960757	1961717	Yes, I must.
1962277	1963758	The man has the car today.
1964058	1964398	I see.
1964618	1964938	All right.
1965058	1973299	And I'd recommend you also don't try to get out your bondages with a lighter because you might set fire to the whole Nazi castle like in Indiana Jones.
1975820	1976280	Shut up.
1977260	1977620	All right.
1978500	1980741	DarkSakura, your final thought then before you take off.
1980941	1981881	Fuck your Yankee blue jeans.
1982281	1982641	I'm sorry.
1982761	1983601	Reject false icons.
1984341	1984561	All right.
1984601	1985361	Bye, DarkSakura.
1985561	1986041	Bye.
1986102	1986842	Thanks for playing.
1986862	1988582	Have fun storming the castle.
1989432	1990133	We're not done just yet.
1990173	1993035	We have another couple quick stories for you guys, then we're going to make it a wrap.
1993756	1994616	PlayStation 3.
1995897	1999541	You remember how PlayStation 3 was originally supposed to double as a router as well?
2000341	2000621	It was?
2000942	2001222	Yeah.
2001422	2003164	It was originally going to double as a router.
2003864	2005285	Well, kids, not anymore.
2005626	2007067	It's no longer going to be a router.
2007087	2011991	They have quietly dropped over at Sony the PlayStation 3 router functionality.
2012031	2015013	And that was going to, of course, make your PlayStation 3 able to function as a router.
2015514	2015694	Well...
2017074	2024576	I can understand why they had it function as a router, because I was looking at the pictures of it, and there's like three Ethernet ports, and I'm like, what the hell is that for?
2024596	2027116	There's like 5,000 ports on the back of a PlayStation 3.
2027396	2031117	But Ethernet ports, I'm like, what the hell do they need three Ethernet ports for?
2031157	2033337	I just didn't understand that, but whatever.
2033357	2037578	Well, now you've got to wonder, are they even going to be the Ethernet ports anymore, if they're getting rid of the networks?
2037598	2038578	That is pretty blank.
2039079	2046140	So are they going to remove functionality, like will they not be able to play games pretty soon, because they've removed the hard drive, they've removed, you know,
2046701	2067155	This, they removed, what else, I mean Here's a hint, Sony, remove the boomerang Your old controller was just fine Seriously Don't try to improve on something that's already good Alright You know, but the rumor is that the Revolution is still going to have this router capability with it That would be cool
2067489	2067669	Yeah.
2067789	2070172	I mean, I don't, I don't, but, but, oh well, we'll see.
2070572	2070933	We'll see.
2071273	2072474	We can speculate all we want.
2072695	2075197	I thought they were releasing their own, like, router or something.
2075217	2076218	Nintendo's router.
2076299	2076539	Who knows?
2076559	2076739	Who knows?
2076759	2078301	We don't know until they start showing the goods.
2078441	2079402	Rumors, rumors until then.
2080808	2081769	Last story tonight.
2082209	2086473	Interesting report over on bmjjournals.com.
2086813	2090416	This is a site that's dedicated to, like, it's like a health care archive.
2091357	2092938	Kind of has a lot of reports.
2093018	2096561	It's the General Medical Journal website is what they call it on their main page.
2097642	2100064	They had an article recently about video games and health.
2100084	2109251	So if you want to look this up, bmjjournals.com, talking about how video games can be used in the treating of cancer patients, which kind of makes you go, well, that's kind of weird.
2110425	2117587	You wouldn't think of that, but sure enough, they say in the report here, one innovative application of video games in healthcare is their use in pain management.
2118007	2126990	The degree of attention needed to play such a game can distract the player from the sensation of pain, a strategy that has been reported and evaluated amongst pediatric patients.
2127490	2132152	One case study reported the use of a handheld video game to stop an eight-year-old boy from peeking at his face.
2132712	2137374	because, you know, he had this disease that was causing him to want to, you know, pick at his face and stuff.
2137695	2142897	So just kind of interesting, video games taking your mind off of other things being used as actual medical treatment.
2143197	2148400	So what a nice follow-up to have to the, you know, video games are evil story that we had earlier in the show.
2148560	2155123	It sure beats the, you know, dog cone collar for, like, you know, people are trying to pick their face.
2155143	2156204	Yes, that's right.
2156544	2159786	But, yeah, I guess that's good.
2159846	2160406	I mean, you know.
2161567	2163108	Laura Croft fights cancer
2191428	2193329	No, I gotta play some more games.
2193369	2200634	There's... I'm trying to... I gotta work on some Killer7 and hopefully they're gonna port ZZT over.
2200914	2202395	Otherwise, you know what the next thing I gotta do is?
2202716	2206118	I gotta make some hacked ROMs and put them in my Nintendo Emulator.
2207199	2210681	And my final thought is, I'm gonna go play on my new HDTV.
2210841	2212302	I'm gonna go play 2DX widescreen.
2213523	2213803	That's it.
