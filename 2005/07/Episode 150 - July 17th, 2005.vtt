WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:29.180
Make it

00:29.180 --> 00:35.180
And you feel as though there's made a new world come true

00:35.180 --> 00:37.180
Make it

00:37.180 --> 00:39.180
Gonna cut it out of there

00:39.180 --> 00:41.180
So make it

00:41.180 --> 00:43.180
Yeah, I'm the kind that

00:43.180 --> 00:45.180
Can't hold it

00:45.180 --> 01:14.180
The following live program is a special presentation of Orange Lounge Radio.

01:14.180 --> 01:28.180
Tonight, on Orange Lounge Radio Live, it is episode number 150, which is a landmark number.

01:28.180 --> 01:33.620
To celebrate this landmark occasion, we're going to do the same old crap we always do.

01:33.620 --> 01:37.820
We're going to sit on here and pretend to do a show about DDR, and never talk about

01:37.820 --> 01:39.340
it throughout the whole three hours.

01:39.340 --> 01:44.440
And will we find out what the difference between white bread and rustic white bread actually

01:44.440 --> 01:45.440
is?

01:45.440 --> 01:48.200
That's right, Orange Lawn Radio, bringing you the news you really want to know!

01:48.200 --> 01:51.060
About games that we're supposed to be talking about, but we're not.

01:51.060 --> 01:53.060
For the past 150 episodes, no.

01:53.060 --> 01:58.160
In all seriousness, we have brand new MP3s from Happy Sky for those three of you people

01:58.160 --> 02:00.500
who haven't already torrented them.

02:00.500 --> 02:05.980
We have some news on, there was something I wanted to say, oh the lawsuit!

02:05.980 --> 02:09.880
There's more stuff about the lawsuit because we didn't get bitched out enough for talking

02:09.880 --> 02:11.840
about the lawsuit too much last week.

02:11.840 --> 02:16.040
All this and more tonight after this brief introduction, yadda yadda yadda yadda yadda

02:16.040 --> 02:17.040
yadda yadda yadda.

02:17.040 --> 02:31.040

03:40.040 --> 03:44.040
Just kidding, Orange Lounge Radio will not contain any of that.

03:44.040 --> 03:45.040
In this episode...

03:45.040 --> 03:47.040
Well isn't that special?

might know me as sky joining me as always are my awesome co-hosts in this

04:46.680 --> 04:51.680
In this corner, the happiest bunny on the farm is Jamie Summers, also known as Dark Sakura.

04:56.680 --> 05:05.680
Actually, she's not here right now. In true Orange Lounge Radio fashion, whenever we have a really big show number, like a landmark show, she's off doing something else.

05:06.680 --> 05:10.680
She will be here tonight, boys and girls. She'll just be a little late because there's a birthday in the family.

05:10.680 --> 05:15.840
I think it's grandma or aunt or somebody's having a birthday so she's off there

05:15.840 --> 05:19.240
but she'll be here around the seven o'clock hour so she's probably on her

05:19.240 --> 05:19.960
way right now

05:19.960 --> 05:22.960
but we do have the one and only tech master, Loki!

05:22.960 --> 05:26.640
I am here. And how are you doing?

05:26.640 --> 05:30.040
Okay I guess. Did you go on a diet or something?

05:30.040 --> 05:33.680
No. Because you used to bring in the Pizza Hut every night.

05:33.680 --> 05:38.040
And now you brought in the Togo's. I had pizza yesterday.

05:38.040 --> 05:43.040
Well, we do have the one and only, uh, Loki's fiance with us tonight.

05:43.040 --> 05:44.040
Hi!

05:44.040 --> 05:47.040
So she's gonna fill in for Jamie, giving us the female perspective.

05:47.040 --> 05:51.040
Ah, the world sucks, I'm Jamie! I hope she's not listening.

05:51.040 --> 05:56.040
No, she's not. But, I have to know, um, what are your favorite video games?

06:00.040 --> 06:01.040
I don't know, Matt.

06:01.040 --> 06:02.040
Tetris?

06:02.040 --> 06:05.040
Yeah, Tetris! I like Tetris.

06:05.040 --> 06:06.040
She also likes Zookeeper.

06:06.040 --> 06:13.420
yes and I like to keep her like pac-man do you what do you think of DDR it kind

06:13.420 --> 06:18.820
of looks like line dancing because when you have like the two people and there

06:18.820 --> 06:28.400
is it kind of does don't you think kinda kinda oh yes it's gonna be a fun show

06:28.400 --> 06:32.660
tonight boys and girls we'll be back after this brief introduction we're

06:32.660 --> 06:36.660
We're going to play some MP3s from the new Happy Sky soundtrack.

06:36.660 --> 06:37.660
Happy Sky!

06:37.660 --> 06:39.660
Does that make you Happy Sky?

06:39.660 --> 06:45.660
No, actually, I'll tell you what I think about 2DX12's style in a little bit.

06:45.660 --> 06:47.660
I do like this first song we're going to play.

06:47.660 --> 06:54.660
We're going to start it off with a remix of Thunder, a new DJ Taka song from Happy Sky.

06:54.660 --> 06:56.660
Oh, not the same Thunder I thought it was.

06:56.660 --> 06:58.660
No, but it's that...

06:58.660 --> 07:01.660
The, I'm moving through the mea-

07:01.660 --> 07:04.360
You know the one everybody used to play on ASL? Such a horrid song.

07:04.360 --> 07:06.860
Such a horrid song. Well, they remixed it for Happy Sky.

07:06.860 --> 07:08.260
We're gonna play that.

07:08.260 --> 07:10.760
You'll see, you'll see. You're the recognizer, or you don't.

07:10.760 --> 07:12.760
Inazuma will be back after this

08:40.760 --> 08:45.640
There is a love to find

08:45.640 --> 08:50.520
I'm where my heart belongs

08:50.520 --> 08:55.120
I'm living through the mist

08:55.120 --> 08:58.560
I love to find

09:28.560 --> 09:52.080
I just want to let you know I just want to let you know

10:22.080 --> 10:51.000
At the top of my journal

10:52.080 --> 10:58.080
Music

10:58.080 --> 11:04.080
Music

11:04.080 --> 11:10.080
Music

11:10.080 --> 11:16.080
Music

14:46.080 --> 15:03.400
After this song, we'll be having a Let Them Move marathon.

15:03.400 --> 15:04.400
No!

15:04.400 --> 15:10.240
Just kidding, Orange Lounge Radio, crap-free Bhavani Radio.

15:10.240 --> 15:13.600
We are back here on the Orange Lounge Radio.

15:13.600 --> 15:18.640
Those were some musics there from 2DX, Happy Sky, 12th Style.

15:18.640 --> 15:19.640
I just call it 12th Style.

15:19.640 --> 15:22.980
I don't care if they're giving them subtitles now, it's 12th Style.

15:22.980 --> 15:26.280
Happy Sky.

15:26.280 --> 15:31.400
And as a homosexual, I'm going to say Happy Sky is the gayest name I've ever heard.

15:31.400 --> 15:32.400
Sorry.

15:32.400 --> 15:36.560
Super Happy American Death Party!

15:36.560 --> 15:41.360
In that break, we heard DJ Taco with Inazuma, which is a remix of Thunder, and I got bitched

15:41.360 --> 15:46.320
in the chatroom because you know jazz came in and was like nah you did not just bash on thunder

15:46.320 --> 15:52.240
uh-uh no you didn't and um okay i like thunder i like it a lot but let's face it that song was

15:52.240 --> 15:57.920
horrid when 2d x8 style was that it was that and beauty of silence and i love beauty of silence too

15:57.920 --> 16:03.760
uh but those songs were all hoard so i'm sorry i was having trouble paying attention to those

16:03.760 --> 16:09.440
songs because nelly here is trying to violate me with this stupid ethernet hey hey hey stop

16:09.440 --> 16:11.400
Stop sticking that cat five up his pants.

16:11.400 --> 16:12.400
We've got to put that...

16:12.400 --> 16:17.000
I stuck it up Rob's butt a minute ago and he didn't even notice it.

16:17.000 --> 16:18.000
Did you, Rob?

16:18.000 --> 16:19.920
Can I try and do the show here, please?

16:19.920 --> 16:20.920
Sorry.

16:20.920 --> 16:21.920
All right.

16:21.920 --> 16:22.920
After that break, Ryu...

16:22.920 --> 16:23.920
I'm sorry.

16:23.920 --> 16:30.120
Also in that set, Ryu with In Motion, Mr. T with Vault of Heaven, and the one more extra

16:30.120 --> 16:36.280
stage, oh my gods, Amuro versus Killer with Mei, which means dark in Japanese.

16:36.280 --> 16:37.280
You know what else it means?

16:37.280 --> 16:40.000
I made the same song three times. That's what it means

16:40.720 --> 16:44.800
Let me let me just run my hand up and down the piano again, and let's see

16:44.800 --> 16:50.040
It's the same damn beat. Oh, I made a song piano in it. I'm gonna run my hand up and down the piano

16:50.040 --> 16:52.040
Oh, you know that's not the part

16:52.720 --> 16:54.720
Where's the part with us?

17:01.120 --> 17:05.960
And you know that's just gonna be key presses all over the place and people are only gonna be able to beat it by putting

17:05.960 --> 17:10.280
it on random unless you're just insane at 2DX which and you know if that's the

17:10.280 --> 17:17.280
case and more power to you anyway I don't know I me personally I haven't

17:17.280 --> 17:22.360
really sat down and listened to all the happy sky mp3s I'm not cool I didn't get

17:22.360 --> 17:25.400
the mp3s earlier in the week I just got them last night so I haven't had a

17:25.400 --> 17:31.040
chance to listen to all of them but the ones I did listen to I was kind of like

17:31.040 --> 17:35.560
it's not that great I mean me personally but you know what to be honest I hated

17:35.560 --> 17:40.560
I did Sixth Style when it first came out too, like when I first heard the soundtrack to Sixth Style, I was like, what a bunch of garbage.

17:40.560 --> 17:49.560
But then when I actually played it on the home console, or, I don't know, no, when I played it in the arcades, I was like, wow, there's actually a lot of songs in here I really do like, after all.

17:49.560 --> 17:55.560
I think, and as somebody said, it has to do with soundboard rips versus original soundtrack.

17:55.560 --> 18:03.560
Navi, the pop music horror, and I were talking about this on AIM last night, it has to do with the rips from the game with the key presses versus the way it sounds on the original soundtrack.

18:03.560 --> 18:07.480
can change the way it sounds a lot so I'm hoping my opinion of the songs

18:07.480 --> 18:12.800
change because right now I'm just kind of like hey even with 2dx red I was kind

18:12.800 --> 18:15.760
of hey I mean there were a couple songs I really likes in red on the way of

18:15.760 --> 18:20.600
guitar freaks I know it makes me sad because for for a long time we were

18:20.600 --> 18:23.840
thinking that Oh 2dx is gonna be dead ten style is the last one and then it

18:23.840 --> 18:29.880
came back and we're all excited and then the songs are so far but somebody out

18:29.880 --> 18:33.540
there likes them so I guess we shouldn't rag on them too much it's just not my

18:33.540 --> 18:38.760
cup of tea. They need to do, because the killer, I mean, I can't remember the song they did

18:38.760 --> 18:47.760
for 2DX Red, whatever it was. It, it was some cool song, or crappy song, I mean. And, um,

18:47.760 --> 18:52.440
so now, um, I don't know, the killer sounds like something like a metal band. And that

18:52.440 --> 18:56.320
would've been awesome, like, you know, heavy metal guitars with the piano, I guess. I think

18:56.320 --> 19:00.960
that would've been cool. But, that was, what did he do? The killer's like, I'm gonna speed

19:00.960 --> 19:07.960
the tempo up. Look, I'm done. That was it. That was my contribution.

19:09.240 --> 19:13.200
Alright, anyways, that's my rant on Happy Sky. It's like, you honestly wonder, yeah,

19:13.200 --> 19:18.520
we need one more extra stage song. Ugh! Fine, let's just, oh, I can't take a piece of that,

19:18.520 --> 19:24.560
piece of that, speed it up, done. There are a couple songs in 2DX Happy Sky I do kinda

19:24.560 --> 19:28.880
like. I liked the Thunder remix because I loved the original Thunder, even though it

19:28.880 --> 19:30.880
It was Hoard. So Hoard.

19:30.880 --> 19:32.880
Yeah, I liked it until she started singing.

19:32.880 --> 19:36.880
That's the part that comes from Thunder. The rest of it's all different.

19:36.880 --> 19:38.880
Oh yeah, that's why.

19:41.880 --> 19:42.880
Anyway.

19:42.880 --> 19:48.880
That would be like, you know, doing, you know, having the intro part, you know, there and then all of a sudden the left of the move breaks in there.

19:48.880 --> 19:51.880
It just doesn't fit. It's the same with that, you know.

19:51.880 --> 19:58.960
Okay, remember Ultramix 2, and it had a remix of Make a Jam, which wasn't bad, it was actually

19:58.960 --> 20:01.960
kind of cool, the Make a Jam remix, you remember that?

20:01.960 --> 20:05.560
Somebody could remix Let Them Move and make it a good song, they really could, it's just

20:05.560 --> 20:07.400
nobody wants to.

20:07.400 --> 20:08.400
Or something.

20:08.400 --> 20:11.000
No, Let Them Move could be remixed into a good song, please.

20:11.000 --> 20:16.080
If they could make Make a Jam a good song, Let Them Move remix for Ultramix 3!

20:16.080 --> 20:17.080
Please!

20:17.080 --> 20:19.360
And Michael Jackson can make a comeback, too.

20:19.360 --> 20:22.240
That's right.

20:22.240 --> 20:25.480
All right, we'll start off tonight's show as we usually

20:25.480 --> 20:27.560
like to start off the show playing a little bit of How

20:27.560 --> 20:29.400
Was Your Week, How Was Your Day?

20:29.400 --> 20:32.160
Loki, how was your week, how was your day?

20:32.160 --> 20:33.480
It sucks.

20:33.480 --> 20:37.400
It started off good, and then it just ended up crappy.

20:37.400 --> 20:40.920
Started off OK throughout the week and everything, hiding

20:40.920 --> 20:43.880
from the heat because it's been pretty hot around here.

20:43.880 --> 20:49.960
And then on Friday, I had to start babysitting my mom's dog,

20:49.960 --> 20:52.040
so that involves house-sitting as well.

20:52.040 --> 20:54.160
Wouldn't that be considered dog-sitting?

20:54.160 --> 20:57.280
No, it's also house-sitting, and she acts like a baby.

20:57.280 --> 21:01.160
So anyways, I had to go do that.

21:01.160 --> 21:05.000
Luckily, ironically enough or whatever,

21:05.000 --> 21:08.560
the air conditioning stopped working in our apartment.

21:08.560 --> 21:11.200
Luckily, we're in another house, so it doesn't really

21:11.200 --> 21:11.840
matter right now.

21:11.840 --> 21:40.840
But no, this is the second time it's happened since we've lived there. So that's not good. And then, um, what else? Oh, yeah, the dog is on this weird routine because my mom works weird hours. She works, you know, really early in the morning. Gives up, like, four in the morning. So the dog wakes me up three times during the night. It's, like, once at eleven, once at three, once at seven, and then once at ten. It's, like, knock it off. And, like, she'll wake you up.

21:40.840 --> 21:46.840
Okay, you wanna go outside? Nope, just staring at you. I don't want anything, I just wanted to wake you up.

21:46.840 --> 21:49.840
That's fucking annoying.

21:49.840 --> 21:53.840
So, that sucked. And then, um...

21:53.840 --> 21:58.840
I don't know, really, other than that, not too much has been going on in work. It's been okay.

21:58.840 --> 22:06.840
I've been just kind of trying to pay attention to work as much as possible and not fiddle with my PSP.

22:06.840 --> 22:10.520
people want me to put games on there because they outed me as saying that

22:10.520 --> 22:14.080
oh yeah that guy knows how to put Nintendo games on your PSP

22:14.080 --> 22:17.240
so everybody walks up to me and says are you busy?

22:17.240 --> 22:20.720
put games on it!

22:20.720 --> 22:24.720
I have to constantly do that but you know

22:24.720 --> 22:28.240
it's cool you know I think it's wonderful that you work for the game

22:28.240 --> 22:31.360
distributor and you're a big ol' pirate when it comes to things like that I mean

22:31.360 --> 22:32.160
seriously

22:32.160 --> 22:36.160
there are pirates inside every company and they wonder why

22:36.160 --> 22:39.160
this stuff turns up on the internet days after release.

22:39.160 --> 22:40.160
I don't pirate games.

22:40.160 --> 22:42.160
Much?

22:42.160 --> 22:44.160
I don't pirate any games. I don't...

22:44.160 --> 22:46.160
I'm not the person that puts them on the internet.

22:46.160 --> 22:48.160
I'm just the person who downloads them off the internet.

22:48.160 --> 22:50.160
And shares them with all your co-workers.

22:50.160 --> 22:51.160
I don't...

22:51.160 --> 22:54.160
Okay, I share the Nintendo games with them, but you know what?

22:54.160 --> 22:56.160
They're so small.

22:56.160 --> 22:58.160
It's like... I don't know.

22:58.160 --> 22:59.160
And these other games...

22:59.160 --> 23:02.160
Loki, Loki, are you busy? Could you come rob a bank with me?

23:02.160 --> 23:05.160
These other games that I'm testing out

23:05.160 --> 23:09.160
are just games that aren't coming out over here yet. It's all Japanese games on my PSP.

23:09.160 --> 23:14.160
By the way, I should say that my PSP has four commercial games on the memory card itself.

23:14.160 --> 23:19.160
Your internet penis is huge. Congratulations. Thank you.

23:19.160 --> 23:27.160
And, yeah, so that's pretty much my week. It's been just that, so.

23:27.160 --> 23:32.160
Oh, oh, forgot. Yesterday we had our bad movie night. It was pretty cool.

23:32.160 --> 23:37.520
cool we watched it came from somewhere else which was really retarded all the

23:37.520 --> 23:41.480
violent all the gore and nudity scenes were all in color but the rest of the

23:41.480 --> 23:44.960
movie is black and white and then we started watching this movie called like

23:44.960 --> 23:49.400
Hanzo the razor or something like that and I highly recommend no one watches

23:49.400 --> 23:53.960
this because I thought okay samurai you know exploitation movie or something

23:53.960 --> 23:58.560
like that you know it's made in the 70s or whatever and Hanzo's like torturing

23:58.560 --> 24:02.700
himself you know first then all of a sudden out of nowhere he's pouring hot

24:02.700 --> 24:07.340
water on his penis and then puts it on a Lego board and starts beating it with a stick

24:07.340 --> 24:11.900
and then starts screwing a bag of rock salt I was like what the hell are you

24:11.900 --> 24:16.460
watching why did you make me watch this and the whole movie is right in the back

24:16.460 --> 24:19.800
I'm like oh my god why are we watching this thing so we turn that off and then

24:19.800 --> 24:25.220
we watch attack attack the gas station which that movie is awesome so it ended

24:25.220 --> 24:27.660
on a good note and uh...

24:27.660 --> 24:32.060
yet hansa the raiser don't watch it awful movie

24:32.060 --> 24:35.260
and that was my week

24:35.260 --> 24:39.780
all right sounds good

24:39.780 --> 24:41.340
who made you want some of the

24:41.340 --> 24:44.380
for jason he brought every said this movie is awesome

24:44.380 --> 24:46.300
he didn't even watch it might do it

24:46.300 --> 24:47.340
and we're like

24:47.340 --> 24:48.520
are come on

24:48.520 --> 24:49.840
they've been

24:49.840 --> 24:52.060
it is like it even like

24:52.060 --> 24:56.900
showed it but it was kind of blurred out, you know, out of focus, but it was just all

24:56.900 --> 25:01.580
like bang, I'm like what the... And this review is coming from a man who made people sit their

25:01.580 --> 25:06.140
feeders too, and then the people go, why are we watching this, this is crap, he goes, no,

25:06.140 --> 25:09.860
this is awesome, look how bad it is. They sat there about two minutes of that, I wanted

25:09.860 --> 25:12.940
to watch Feeders 2 last night, I brought it to the table, I'm like, let's watch this,

25:12.940 --> 25:17.740
this is the worst movie ever, okay? Ugly damn people in this movie, but no one on the watch

25:17.740 --> 25:21.340
list. Santa Claus saves the day. Have I ever made you watch Desperate Living, one of my

25:21.340 --> 25:26.140
favorite movies, John Waters? No. With the amazingly humongous black woman that's

25:26.140 --> 25:29.280
like full-frontally nude through a lot of the movies? You know, I probably would enjoy

25:29.280 --> 25:32.360
the movie just because I enjoy weird movies like that. It's awesome. It's like one of

25:32.360 --> 25:36.980
my favorite movies ever. Well, there's another one I'm getting, I haven't paid for it yet,

25:36.980 --> 25:43.220
but it's inbred, or is it Bloodsucking Vampire Rednecks? That's gonna be coming. If you look

25:43.220 --> 25:49.300
up the, well, let me just say there's this really ginormous person in this movie that's

25:49.300 --> 25:52.460
nude in it as well, and she must weigh like 600 pounds.

25:52.460 --> 25:56.260
I kid you not. You know, you and I need to go to that trash film orgy sometime. Oh my

25:56.260 --> 25:59.960
God. They do this thing here in Sacramento where, you know, we all live and the show's

25:59.960 --> 26:04.380
based. They do this trash film orgy at the big, the artsy theater downtown and they show

26:04.380 --> 26:09.260
all these like really horrid, horrid movies. Well, this old friend of mine that I used

26:09.260 --> 26:13.580
to do Rocky Horror with, like way back in the day, she is like the trash film queen

26:13.580 --> 26:19.140
or whatever. Well, I'm surfing Myspace yesterday and I see this picture and it says the trash

26:19.140 --> 26:25.460
film queen and all it is is a picture of breasts with stickers taping over it. I'm like dude

26:25.460 --> 26:34.540
that's Sarah! Yes! But the scary thing is I recognized a picture of a girl from the

26:34.540 --> 26:39.940
breasts alone and nothing else. That's pretty odd. Those are huge ass tits so you can see

26:39.940 --> 26:45.780
them from. She's awesome though. Anyways, I know this is great radio, but I wanted to

26:45.780 --> 26:50.940
show you a picture of this woman that's in this movie and this is the reason why

26:50.940 --> 26:57.260
this movie is so awful but let me see here doo-doo-doo-doo-doo there it is

26:57.260 --> 27:05.660
right there she basically sits on some guy's head and it like kills him that's

27:05.660 --> 27:11.380
what I look like they can see look at it okay so can you post a link in our chat

27:11.380 --> 27:14.260
room to that oh yeah you're not in the chair are you not in the chair where is

27:14.260 --> 27:18.260
it's not something up just look it up on something awful calm go under their

27:18.260 --> 27:23.380
movie reviews and look for blood-sucking vampire rednecks and go to about page

27:23.380 --> 27:28.780
four and yeah though I love reading something awful comms movie reviews

27:28.780 --> 27:35.060
because they're hilarious but anyways yeah it it's nasty so yeah you know it's

27:35.060 --> 27:39.660
it's um it's kind of like last week when I was trying to show all the videos on

27:39.660 --> 27:47.100
air you try to go in and show people the the things you're doing nevermind yeah

27:47.100 --> 27:50.860
it's like if you were to make if you were to take some really nasty biker

27:50.860 --> 27:57.700
woman and eye patch and her leg is like the size of an elephant that was probably

27:57.700 --> 28:05.660
be that you know like an accurate description anyway don't lie you know

28:05.660 --> 28:13.540
know you think she's hot. Oh yeah I want to do her folds. Speaking of videos that

28:13.540 --> 28:20.020
we play. Common behavior years ago can now be sexual harassment. Smells like vagina in here.

28:20.020 --> 28:31.220
My vagina? Smells like fresh vagina in here. Are you talking about my vagina? Maybe. Anyway um Nellie

28:31.220 --> 28:35.220
Emily, how was your week? How was your day?

28:35.220 --> 28:39.220
It was the same as Matt's except I watched that video and that was pretty funny

28:39.220 --> 28:43.220
and I showed it to my coworker and she told me a funny story about

28:43.220 --> 28:47.220
how she had sex with this guy but not really where he kind of slipped

28:47.220 --> 28:51.220
and he entered in between her butt cheeks again. You know we have children that listen to this

28:51.220 --> 28:55.220
program. Keep talking. That's what my week was like. It was like talking

28:55.220 --> 28:59.220
about funny shit like that. So it was wonderful and today

28:59.220 --> 29:03.220
That was great, because I got laid.

29:03.220 --> 29:07.220
Ironically enough, so did I.

29:07.220 --> 29:11.220
No!

29:11.220 --> 29:15.220
My old friend Bugged, who's known me longer than most people.

29:15.220 --> 29:19.220
Yes, and I feel like I don't know you anymore.

29:19.220 --> 29:23.220
Why is that? Because of these freaks!

29:23.220 --> 29:27.220
The chat room is telling me I'm not actually gay, because of the fact that I was able to ID a woman based on her tits.

29:27.220 --> 29:30.220
No, no, no. That has nothing to do with...

29:30.220 --> 29:33.220
Bugs has known I was gay longer than I have, actually.

29:33.220 --> 29:36.220
It's true!

29:36.220 --> 29:39.220
Alright, anyway. How was your week? How was your day?

29:39.220 --> 29:41.220
Not as exciting as anyone else's.

29:41.220 --> 29:42.220
Did you get laid today?

29:42.220 --> 29:42.220
No.

29:42.220 --> 29:43.220
That's too bad.

29:46.220 --> 29:48.220
We gotta make them blush, not us.

29:48.220 --> 29:52.220
What was Rob like when he was just this little whore?

29:52.220 --> 29:55.220
What? I was never a little whore. I didn't get laid.

29:55.220 --> 30:03.220
I didn't lose my virginity until I was like 20 years old, but you have to remember I had all these issues going on at the same time.

30:03.220 --> 30:04.220
So if you're like-

30:04.220 --> 30:05.220
Andrea issues?

30:05.220 --> 30:12.220
Don't talk about my aunt's girlfriend on the air! We're famous on the internet, she might listen for god's sake.

30:12.220 --> 30:13.220
No.

30:13.220 --> 30:14.220
I'm just looking at Loki's screen and-

30:14.220 --> 30:15.220
Stop. Stop.

30:15.220 --> 30:16.220
Yeah.

30:16.220 --> 30:17.220
Stop.

30:17.220 --> 30:19.220
You're horrible.

30:19.220 --> 30:21.220
That's why you keep me around.

30:21.220 --> 30:27.220
Anyway, now I lost my train of thought. Forget it.

30:27.220 --> 30:29.220
Now my week wasn't exciting to anyone else.

30:29.220 --> 30:34.220
I know what I was going to say. If you're still 20-21 and you haven't lost your virginity, it might just be because you're gay.

30:34.220 --> 30:37.220
No, I'm kidding. I'm kidding. I'm totally kidding you guys.

30:37.220 --> 30:39.220
But I had all those issues.

30:39.220 --> 30:40.220
You're really ugly.

30:40.220 --> 30:41.220
Stop it.

30:41.220 --> 30:43.220
Was that your problem, Matt?

30:43.220 --> 30:44.220
I...

30:44.220 --> 30:45.220
Yes it was!

30:45.220 --> 30:46.220
Look...

30:46.220 --> 30:55.380
My plate caused the deaths of thousands of people!

30:55.380 --> 30:59.300
That's a great story, you should tell it on there.

30:59.300 --> 31:02.980
Look, look, um, that's why it took so long, because I was like, do I like pussy?

31:02.980 --> 31:03.980
Actually, no I don't.

31:03.980 --> 31:06.340
I kind of like, I like guys, so...

31:06.340 --> 31:07.340
Everybody likes pussy.

31:07.340 --> 31:09.340
My hands smell like tuna.

31:09.340 --> 31:14.420
I'm bugged! Anything else you want to say about your week and your day?

31:14.420 --> 31:19.500
It's fucking hot. It is. Is the AC on in here? I don't know.

31:19.500 --> 31:23.220
I don't know. You live here. All right.

31:23.220 --> 31:26.380
Your TV's running. Oh, that's true. And nobody's out there watching

31:26.380 --> 31:29.300
it? No. No. That was my week and my day. As of like

31:29.300 --> 31:36.340
an hour and a half ago, I just purchased a new HDTV, a 30-inch HDTV, because I wanted

31:36.340 --> 31:39.340
Must be nice.

31:39.340 --> 31:43.340
Well, here's the thing. I have some extra money right now, because this is a three paycheck month.

31:43.340 --> 31:48.340
And so I was deciding, do I want to get a power book, or do I want to get a new TV?

31:48.340 --> 31:52.340
And I was going to get the power book, but then my friend said, oh, it'll take six weeks to get here.

31:52.340 --> 31:56.340
I'm like, fuck that, because I'm going to the East Coast, because I'm going to get the discount, because my friend works for Apple.

31:56.340 --> 32:01.340
But it would take six weeks to get there. And I said, well, fuck that, because I'm going to Pennsylvania in two weeks, and that's what I want my laptop for.

32:01.340 --> 32:03.340
So I'm just going to use my parent shitty old...

32:03.340 --> 32:05.340
What the hell is this whole nexus with Pennsylvania?

32:05.340 --> 32:07.340
I don't know. It's just this void where I get sucked into for work.

32:07.340 --> 32:10.340
My roommates just moved there. My new roommates are from there.

32:10.340 --> 32:13.340
You're bouncing through there.

32:13.340 --> 32:14.340
Yeah, I know. It's weird.

32:14.340 --> 32:16.340
I feel sorry for everyone in Pennsylvania.

32:16.340 --> 32:21.340
So anyway, I really want to get a PowerBook, but it'll wait until the end of the year because I also really want a TV.

32:21.340 --> 32:23.340
So I'm getting the TV first.

32:23.340 --> 32:24.340
So I got the TV.

32:24.340 --> 32:25.340
Interesting gratification.

32:25.340 --> 32:29.340
But get this, the TV, it's not bad. I got it at Costco. Only $600.

32:29.340 --> 32:30.340
No shit?

32:30.340 --> 32:33.660
Yeah, not bad for HDTV the picture is pretty good

32:33.660 --> 32:39.180
You should see a DVD on that thing pop in the Xbox put that on white screen looks hot mom's looking for a new TV

32:41.740 --> 32:43.740
But I have to set up her TiVo tomorrow

32:44.820 --> 32:46.820
Hmm, I have to set up her new TiVo tomorrow

32:46.820 --> 32:49.680
You know why I was gonna get a TiVo and then I realized we can't use TiVo

32:50.300 --> 32:53.200
Because we don't have a phone line in the house, but don't need a phone line

32:53.200 --> 32:55.980
But you have to have a phone line for the initial setup. Don't you take it somebody else's place?

32:55.980 --> 33:00.980
Oh shit, I never thought of that. You're too smart! Get out of my house!

33:00.980 --> 33:03.980
How the fuck do you think I did it?

33:03.980 --> 33:07.980
You can join our chat room, www.orangelaungeradio.com

33:07.980 --> 33:08.980
Or not.

33:08.980 --> 33:13.980
No, join it. It's a good time. And I've got some comments here. Somebody is saying

33:13.980 --> 33:17.980
Somebody is shaking their fist at me because they're 28 and still a virgin.

33:17.980 --> 33:22.980
Dude, it's alright. You know what? Let me give you the truth about sex, okay?

33:22.980 --> 33:23.980
Oh, this should be good.

33:23.980 --> 33:27.980
Once you have it, you always want it.

33:27.980 --> 33:28.980
Is it a boy or a girl?

33:28.980 --> 33:30.980
Seriously, don't lose a boy.

33:30.980 --> 33:32.980
Oh, I'll tell you why you're still a virgin.

33:32.980 --> 33:33.980
Why?

33:33.980 --> 33:34.980
Because you're in that chatroom.

33:34.980 --> 33:35.980
Stop it!

33:35.980 --> 33:36.980
That's not...

33:36.980 --> 33:37.980
He's a nice guy.

33:37.980 --> 33:38.980
Stop it.

33:38.980 --> 33:39.980
Who is it?

33:39.980 --> 33:40.980
Some...

33:40.980 --> 33:41.980
A good...

33:41.980 --> 33:42.980
I'm sorry if you're nice.

33:42.980 --> 33:43.980
Hey, hey.

33:43.980 --> 33:44.980
Our chatroom gets people laid.

33:44.980 --> 33:47.980
I don't want to think about that.

33:47.980 --> 33:48.980
Look, I'll tell you what.

33:48.980 --> 33:50.980
Once you have it, you always want it.

33:50.980 --> 33:52.980
Stay a virgin until you're 40, honestly.

33:55.980 --> 33:56.980
What else is there?

33:56.980 --> 33:59.980
Somebody wants to know if there's an Apple store here in Sacramento.

33:59.980 --> 34:01.980
Yes, there is, and I was just there today.

34:01.980 --> 34:05.980
Because my roommate, his ex-defer, is having a birthday on Tuesday,

34:05.980 --> 34:07.980
and his parents got him a gift card for the Apple store,

34:07.980 --> 34:09.980
and he went and bought an iPod.

34:09.980 --> 34:13.980
But the little bastard, for the same price I bought my iPod for,

34:13.980 --> 34:17.980
like, what, in December, he got a color iPod.

34:17.980 --> 34:19.980
I got mine for 190, 20 gig.

34:19.980 --> 34:23.340
Fucking Apple. Fucking price cuts.

34:23.340 --> 34:26.420
He should have paid more than what I pay, it's not fair.

34:26.420 --> 34:30.340
What'd you pay, $300? $300.

34:30.340 --> 34:33.340
That's what he paid today and he got a color one. I got a 20 gig black and white,

34:33.340 --> 34:37.020
he got a 20 gig color. So he's like, and of course he has to come in here and show me,

34:37.020 --> 34:41.100
Look Rob! I have album art on my iPod!

34:41.100 --> 34:46.300
I look at my iPod twice a day. The rest of the time it resides in my armrest.

34:46.300 --> 34:49.900
Anyway.

34:49.900 --> 34:55.500
The rest of my week of my day, I saw Charlie and the Chocolate Factory on Friday night.

34:55.500 --> 34:57.860
Oh my God, I loved it.

34:57.860 --> 35:02.060
It was so good.

35:02.060 --> 35:05.700
Don't go there expecting to see the first movie because a common misconception about

35:05.700 --> 35:08.380
this new movie is that it's a remake of the first movie and it's not.

35:08.380 --> 35:12.680
It's a remake of the book, or I should say a reinterpretation of the book because the

35:12.680 --> 35:16.580
first movie, as good as it was, don't get me wrong, I love the first movie, but they

35:16.580 --> 35:19.860
got so many things really, really wrong from the book.

35:19.860 --> 35:22.580
Where the hell was the elevator?

35:22.580 --> 35:24.420
The elevator was in the first movie, it was on the very end.

35:24.420 --> 35:26.580
Not as prominently as it was in the book.

35:26.580 --> 35:27.580
Exactly, exactly.

35:27.580 --> 35:32.280
And just the songs were different, and Veruca Salt's whole scene was completely different.

35:32.280 --> 35:36.300
But some people like that because she had the whole, I want it now, now, you know, she

35:36.300 --> 35:38.220
added a whole little song and some people loved that.

35:38.220 --> 35:41.980
And that's not in the new movie, and that drives some people crazy.

35:41.980 --> 35:44.500
But I'm telling you, the new movie is awesome.

35:44.500 --> 35:45.500
I loved it.

35:45.500 --> 35:47.180
I highly recommend it.

35:47.180 --> 35:50.680
The reason why I liked it, one of the reasons why I liked it, is because Johnny Depp, like,

35:50.680 --> 35:54.740
hates kids in that movie. And that made it funny.

35:54.740 --> 35:59.460
But some of the, um, Rob, what? Stop mumbling! I can't understand a word you're saying.

35:59.460 --> 36:05.260
Stop it. Yes, uh, Chatroom gave one of the best quotes

36:05.260 --> 36:07.560
in the movie. Everything in this room is edible, including

36:07.560 --> 36:12.380
me, but that's cannibalism, and it's frowned on in many societies.

36:12.380 --> 36:16.660
I liked that. That was funny. Anyway, but some of the Oompa Loompa songs

36:16.660 --> 36:23.660
are crazy. Like here's a little clip from one of the songs.

36:33.860 --> 36:37.940
See, like the songs are just like nutty in this one. Like they range from that

36:37.940 --> 36:42.240
little like weird balloting. Well, like Night Near Before Christmas was, you know.

36:42.240 --> 36:45.900
Well, Danny Elfman did all the songs, so it's like Oingo Boingo revisited. He sung it

36:45.900 --> 36:49.140
all and did the whole like nine yards of that but then like some of the songs

36:49.140 --> 36:54.620
are like way different like then like Veruca's salt song is like a ballad

36:55.260 --> 37:00.020
anyway I like the movie it was cool I stopped the lighter for that one go see

37:00.020 --> 37:03.900
it I highly recommend it it was good don't go in expecting Gene Wilder Willy

37:03.900 --> 37:06.220
Wonka and the Chocolate Factory because that's not what you're gonna get but if

37:06.220 --> 37:08.900
you read the books as a kid you're gonna be you're gonna be very pleased what

37:08.900 --> 37:13.060
about Johnny what about Johnny Depp as a pirate but Johnny Depp doesn't play a

37:13.060 --> 37:17.340
a pirate in this. I heard his inspiration for this movie was Marilyn Manson, which kind

37:17.340 --> 37:18.340
of makes sense.

37:18.340 --> 37:19.340
Oh my God.

37:19.340 --> 37:20.340
No, he said no.

37:20.340 --> 37:21.340
No?

37:21.340 --> 37:22.340
He said it was the original movie.

37:22.340 --> 37:24.220
No, it can't be, because he's nothing like you.

37:24.220 --> 37:27.620
It was Michael Jackson. We know it's Michael Jackson. He's just not admitting to it.

37:27.620 --> 37:33.300
But no, it can't be Michael Jackson, because, hey, Dark Soccer's here. His inspiration can't

37:33.300 --> 37:38.500
be Michael Jackson, because Michael Jackson loves kids almost a little too much. And in

37:38.500 --> 37:41.960
this movie Johnny Depp hated children and that's what made it so amazingly

37:41.960 --> 37:49.240
wonderful that's why I liked it hi dark Sakura you're here in classic orange

37:49.240 --> 37:55.840
lounge fashion your tardy to a landmark episode number I'm kidding huh I'm just

37:55.840 --> 38:00.080
kidding I was doing grandma duty that's all right whose birthday was it I

38:00.080 --> 38:04.320
couldn't remember it's grandmother 70th birthday and grandma 70th person in

38:04.320 --> 38:07.800
Granite Bay in, like, John L. Sullivan's neighborhood.

38:07.800 --> 38:11.120
Granite Bay is like the Mormon central of Northern California.

38:11.120 --> 38:14.360
It's also where rich people go, and they form colonies.

38:14.360 --> 38:18.280
There's no difference.

38:18.280 --> 38:25.520
We went to a school that had half of Granite Bay in it, so the parking lot was like bugs,

38:25.520 --> 38:28.240
old Mustangs, and then Mercedes and BMWs.

38:28.240 --> 38:31.320
I felt very ill the whole time I was there.

38:31.320 --> 38:32.320
It was not too funny.

38:32.320 --> 38:33.400
You didn't go to Wendy's, did you?

38:33.400 --> 38:42.180
brother works there no we had like like gourmet chicken ooh and it landed the

38:42.180 --> 38:51.500
right way and ribs and all kinds of rich people food did you have hors d'oeuvres

38:51.500 --> 38:56.780
no did you have a cheese what's rich white snobby people food did you have

38:56.780 --> 38:59.780
Do you have Escargot?

38:59.780 --> 39:02.780
No, we had like really good salad though.

39:02.780 --> 39:03.780
That's good.

39:03.780 --> 39:04.780
Alright.

39:04.780 --> 39:06.780
DarkSakurai, you're here just in time.

39:06.780 --> 39:07.780
How was your week?

39:07.780 --> 39:11.780
How was your day, my friend?

39:11.780 --> 39:13.780
I played some PSO.

39:13.780 --> 39:15.780
That was it.

39:15.780 --> 39:18.780
Seriously, that was it.

39:18.780 --> 39:19.780
I got really bored.

39:19.780 --> 39:20.780
My computer decided to die.

39:20.780 --> 39:22.780
I put those stupid Windows updates on it.

39:22.780 --> 39:24.780
I'm so ready to get a Mac.

39:24.780 --> 39:26.780
of all this Microsoft bullshit.

39:26.780 --> 39:28.780
Come to the light side.

39:28.780 --> 39:29.780
No!

39:29.780 --> 39:34.020
You know what, you need to get off of your little I hate Mac piece of shit because you

39:34.020 --> 39:35.860
know what, they're really good computers if...

39:35.860 --> 39:40.220
You don't know jack about computers, that's what they're good for, is if you don't want

39:40.220 --> 39:41.220
to do anything.

39:41.220 --> 39:44.620
No, they're more for the people who are specialists in their fields.

39:44.620 --> 39:46.380
Well, they rocket gaming too.

39:46.380 --> 39:51.560
You can also put a bunch of Macs together and get a lot more power out of them, processing

39:51.560 --> 39:52.760
power out of them.

39:52.760 --> 39:59.760
I'm warming up to Macs. I want one. I'm not going to play games on it. I want it for audio.

39:59.760 --> 40:03.920
If I want to play games, I get myself a G5 and put virtual PC on it. I can play any game

40:03.920 --> 40:10.920
I want to, and a story. And on top of that, I have a system that's good for graphics.

40:10.920 --> 40:23.760
I do admit that there's a lot of really stupid Mac users out there who are ultimately clueless

40:23.760 --> 40:26.440
because it actually can do a bunch of stuff for you.

40:26.440 --> 40:28.240
And then there's like the smart people.

40:28.240 --> 40:33.960
So I think like the middle of the line people, the mediocre people are all PC.

40:33.960 --> 40:37.300
Are you still thinking of Macintoshes as what we used in high school though?

40:37.300 --> 40:38.300
Maybe that's the problem.

40:38.300 --> 40:39.300
No.

40:39.300 --> 40:40.300
No, not you.

40:40.300 --> 40:44.300
That's because he's inflexible and won't learn to adjust.

40:44.300 --> 40:48.300
Oh, I am plenty flexible, but I just don't see the processing power of a toaster.

40:48.300 --> 40:52.300
Please don't ever say you're flexible again.

40:52.300 --> 40:56.300
It might damage the children.

40:56.300 --> 41:00.300
I don't think you understand the concept of flexible.

41:00.300 --> 41:04.300
Oh, I understand flexible.

41:04.300 --> 41:08.300
Alright. I think we're going to go to a break.

41:08.300 --> 41:11.300
All I have to say is, you know, in the groove it's just as good as DDR.

41:11.300 --> 41:16.300
No, no, no, no, no. I go for innovation, not stupidity.

41:16.300 --> 41:24.300
I want to talk about the lawsuit, just for a little bit. The chatroom got mad at us because we talked about it too much last week, but I want to say a little bit. There's a little bit of news going on, so I want to talk about that.

41:24.300 --> 41:27.300
Oh, but the chatroom got upset! Oh, no!

41:27.300 --> 41:31.300
You know, the chatroom also needs to learn how to be flexible, too.

41:31.300 --> 41:35.140
right we'll be back after this in this break I want to play a new song from the

41:35.140 --> 41:38.780
new Katamari Damacy game because I got I got some rips from it so we're gonna

41:38.780 --> 41:41.780
play this one I haven't even listened to any of them yet but this one's called

41:41.780 --> 41:46.840
Katamari holiday how bad could it be and the holiday song they didn't worry you

41:46.840 --> 41:50.780
know the movie Katamari Damacy did have the track you are smart with the one

41:50.780 --> 41:53.820
that gave me splitting headaches well we'll see how this one is we'll be back

41:53.820 --> 42:00.820
Check after this with more Orange Lounge Radio.

47:01.860 --> 47:07.860
It's too late to throw a ride at you

47:07.860 --> 47:14.860
Too late is I could offer you

Perfect!

47:43.160 --> 47:43.920
Howdy boys and girls

47:43.920 --> 47:48.800
We're back with more Orange Lounge Radio. Hope you enjoyed that rather long song from Katamari Damacy, but damn it

47:49.120 --> 47:54.140
We just wanted to see if the music in the second game would be just as good as the first game and it's okay

47:54.140 --> 47:58.040
It's part of the chorus. I probably didn't play like the best song

47:58.040 --> 48:01.040
I just picked a good sounding one because I honestly haven't had time to listen to the whole soundtrack

48:01.040 --> 48:04.260
So I just picked one with a good name. So maybe I didn't pick the right one

48:04.900 --> 48:10.200
We are back. We'll talk a little more about the DDR and some of the other games we've been playing

48:10.200 --> 48:14.360
Um what the hell the chat room over at orange launch radio.com click on chat

48:14.360 --> 48:16.640
They're saying I sound like cookie from you don't know Jack

48:16.640 --> 48:19.260
And this this is not the first time the subject has been brought up

48:19.260 --> 48:24.020
I wouldn't know about I've played you don't know Jack like the first one, but I

48:24.860 --> 48:30.680
Then there's like you don't know Jack like every type of addition under the Sun. There was like you know you don't know Jack

48:32.760 --> 48:36.320
Monkey edition, I don't know it's crazy stuff. That's my favorite one

48:36.320 --> 48:42.960
Anyway, here we are.

48:42.960 --> 48:47.400
Let's see, what's going on in the DDR world is that, you

48:47.400 --> 48:49.720
know, there's more stuff going on with the lawsuit, basically.

48:49.720 --> 48:51.800
We talked about this in great lengths last week.

48:51.800 --> 48:54.920
Well, DDR Freak likes to play the smoking gun in these types

48:54.920 --> 48:57.800
of situations, and they dig up the legal documents and post

48:57.800 --> 48:59.540
them on the website for everybody to see.

48:59.540 --> 49:02.520
So you can head on over to ddrfreak.com, and you, too,

49:02.520 --> 49:05.540
can check out the amended complaint against Red Octane

49:05.540 --> 49:11.780
mad cats so everybody can try to be a lawyer yay which just makes the forums

49:11.780 --> 49:15.780
light up with you know blah blah blah blah blah blah I think I'm a lawyer I

49:15.780 --> 49:20.780
know that this this this and I know this this this and the real fact of the

49:20.780 --> 49:25.140
matter is nobody knows shit unless you've been to law school so it's just

49:25.140 --> 49:27.740
interesting everybody's kind of got their own opinion on this whole thing

49:27.740 --> 49:32.300
going on I thought however there was a really excellent article that was done

49:32.300 --> 49:38.640
by our buddy El Mullet, and it's posted over on InsidePulse.com, and he really breaks the

49:38.640 --> 49:42.540
whole thing down, and I encourage anyone that has a passing interest in the lawsuit thing,

49:42.540 --> 49:47.180
this is really what I wanted to talk about, visit InsidePulse.com and check out El Mullet's

49:47.180 --> 49:51.680
article about the whole lawsuit thing, because it really breaks down both sides, and just

49:51.680 --> 49:57.740
kind of talks about, you know, hey, despite how you feel if In the Groove is a good game

49:57.740 --> 50:02.600
or a bad game this is how they're in violation of the law and a story yeah it

50:02.600 --> 50:10.120
doesn't matter how much you go oh you're wrong if it were a good game it wouldn't

50:10.120 --> 50:13.220
matter well this is what ticks people off and this was in the original lawsuit

50:13.220 --> 50:16.000
documents and of course it showed up in these original documents too as the

50:16.000 --> 50:20.400
Konami and their lawsuit says in the groove is an inferior game and people

50:20.400 --> 50:27.400
go you know all the in the groove fanboys he goes but it's got the minds

50:27.400 --> 50:30.080
and it's got the increased steps, and it's got better music.

50:30.080 --> 50:32.400
OK, despite, you know, I don't really

50:32.400 --> 50:33.960
want to have that argument again.

50:33.960 --> 50:36.800
Either you like In the Groove more than you like DDR Extreme

50:36.800 --> 50:38.240
or any of the previous mixes, or you don't.

50:38.240 --> 50:39.440
You're one way or the other.

50:39.440 --> 50:40.320
You think they're OK.

50:40.320 --> 50:41.200
I don't know.

50:41.200 --> 50:43.520
And I did find what was interesting about it

50:43.520 --> 50:47.120
was the whole, they were showing like their patents and stuff,

50:47.120 --> 50:50.360
and they were showing pictures of the concept for DDR and stuff.

50:50.360 --> 50:52.720
And the arrows were supposed to be scrolling downwards

50:52.720 --> 50:54.040
as the original concept.

50:54.040 --> 50:55.600
Those were actually, those documents

50:55.600 --> 50:59.860
in the first set of documents. Well I didn't pay attention to that then. That's why I figured.

50:59.860 --> 51:02.960
Most people didn't because I had, or there was all these people on DDRFreak that I was

51:02.960 --> 51:05.760
watching talk about it like they were new and I'm like, wait a minute, those were in

51:05.760 --> 51:09.960
the first attachment. Didn't you read them all? Oh well. But so, so people are going,

51:09.960 --> 51:14.260
ah, ITG's not inferior. But I think what you have to remember is that the reason why they're

51:14.260 --> 51:20.240
calling it inferior is because, well in A, in their minds it is, I mean, the fact of

51:20.240 --> 51:25.040
the matter. B, just the fact that I think a lot of it has to do with the setup of the

51:25.040 --> 51:28.440
being inferior. And this is why I talked about when the first lawsuit came up is that the

51:28.440 --> 51:33.000
hardware itself is the inferior part. Because in the beginning, and I'm not talking about

51:33.000 --> 51:36.440
in the group two, and neither is the lawsuit, in the beginning, in the group did not have

51:36.440 --> 51:41.840
its own cabinet. It was built to be a stowaway game in other cabinets. Therefore, the hardware

51:41.840 --> 51:48.160
is inferior. Of course, now this lawsuit addresses the home versions, et cetera, et cetera. So

51:48.160 --> 51:53.560
I don't know. I guess they call it inferior because of the fact that it's basically...

51:53.560 --> 52:00.400
Inferior. It's a mock-up of DDR. It kind of started, if you think about it, StepMania,

52:00.400 --> 52:03.280
it's built on a StepMania emulator. You mean a mockery of DDR?

52:03.280 --> 52:09.280
If you think about it, StepMania was built to simulate DDR, right? So a simulator is

52:09.280 --> 52:13.400
always going to be inferior to the original, right? I don't know. I guess that's one way

52:13.400 --> 52:16.040
you can look at it. I don't want to get too far into this, though.

52:16.040 --> 52:20.280
I like how the step charts are already online for In the Groove, because they were easily

52:20.280 --> 52:25.800
ripped from the game because well guess what it's in the groove so wow that was difficult

52:28.120 --> 52:35.240
i know i know how do you like them apples in the groove rock sore but you know what for

52:35.240 --> 52:39.240
i don't think it hurts them at all because the same people that are into the stepmania scene i

52:39.240 --> 52:47.080
think are a large part of the in the groove fan base yourself accepted that was before retards

52:47.080 --> 52:53.380
I don't understand why you won't even give the game a chance you just fucking

52:53.380 --> 52:57.860
suck you've been anti-integration crap out better themes than that and honestly

52:57.860 --> 53:01.580
I suck at making themes I mean those are the plainest looking things I've ever

53:01.580 --> 53:07.180
seen it looks like something you would see in beta okay it's like a beta game

53:07.180 --> 53:12.420
you know he really wouldn't touch it if it was on a Mac I really wouldn't touch

53:12.420 --> 53:16.260
it if it was on a Mac that'd be just crap it it kind of reminds me of the Mac

53:16.260 --> 53:22.340
it's nice and smoothed out and plain colors and pointless because there's

53:22.340 --> 53:28.020
games out there that are better just because it tries to look pretty

53:30.220 --> 53:42.060
iTunes is cool go iTunes just you know run iTunes on your PC Intel PC or you

53:42.060 --> 53:46.860
you know, actually better than Intel PC, your AMD PC,

53:46.860 --> 53:50.220
and you're good to go.

53:50.220 --> 53:52.380
Now, if you have a Mac, you might as well just

53:52.380 --> 53:55.940
get one of those Cyrix chips and throw it in your PC.

53:55.940 --> 53:58.220
Let's step back a generation, shall we?

53:58.220 --> 54:01.020
We've got some folks in the chat room that are going, let me at them,

54:01.020 --> 54:01.620
let me at them.

54:01.620 --> 54:03.660
We will open up the Skype line in a little bit

54:03.660 --> 54:06.500
if you want to give your comments and feedback.

54:06.500 --> 54:09.940
And those cards and letters, love letters addressed to Loki.

54:09.940 --> 54:12.940
www.OrangeLoungeRadio.com

54:12.940 --> 54:17.940
I swear to God, if I ever win an iPod or anything, that sucker is getting burned.

54:17.940 --> 54:20.940
Well, hard drive being ripped out of it first, then it's getting burned.

54:20.940 --> 54:27.940
You know, I don't understand your hatred because I can understand like maybe five years ago

54:27.940 --> 54:31.940
when it looked like Apple was going to go, but now Apple is really, really picking up

54:31.940 --> 54:34.940
and they have got a lot of great products and they're innovative.

54:34.940 --> 54:37.940
I have the same problem with Apple that I also have with VW.

54:37.940 --> 54:39.940
Let's make cute cars that suck.

54:39.940 --> 54:42.940
Cause people like cute, so they'll buy cute.

54:42.940 --> 54:43.940
Have you driven one?

54:43.940 --> 54:46.940
VW has the worst ratings as far as reliability.

54:46.940 --> 54:47.940
Have you driven one?

54:47.940 --> 54:48.940
I've driven in one.

54:48.940 --> 54:50.940
That's not driving one. Have you driven one?

54:50.940 --> 54:51.940
No.

54:51.940 --> 54:53.940
Okay, then you don't have room to talk.

54:53.940 --> 54:54.940
Go have fun.

54:54.940 --> 54:57.940
I don't want to drive your crappy car, no.

54:57.940 --> 55:00.940
I don't want to drive your piece of shit.

55:00.940 --> 55:01.940
Okay.

55:01.940 --> 55:03.940
I'm sorry, you do drive a Ford.

55:03.940 --> 55:05.940
Six off and repair daily.

55:05.940 --> 55:06.940
Most of a Ford.

55:06.940 --> 55:11.580
No, my Ford is fine. I've never had any problems my for yet. Wait three years

55:12.300 --> 55:17.420
Wait three years. I'm a former. I hate to say it Loki. I'm a former Ford owner. Wait, wait

55:18.100 --> 55:23.160
Fine, the only Fords that last any time are the old ones like my fiance's Mustang. Oh

55:24.180 --> 55:26.180
Yeah, that's a sexy car. I

55:26.720 --> 55:28.720
Will never buy another Ford all my car

55:29.220 --> 55:34.940
Thing I will never touch a Mac all my cars from now on will be foreign and you know that my Lancer like completely kicks

55:34.940 --> 55:39.020
all your car's asses combined, so... There will be some... You know what? You're a remixer.

55:39.020 --> 55:44.820
You remix songs. You have never been enticed by some of the Apple products like GarageBand

55:44.820 --> 55:49.540
or any of this stuff, ever. No. Because I can get the same thing on a PC, you know?

55:49.540 --> 55:54.860
So what? Ooh, it's got GarageBand. Ooh! You know, there's a PC equivalent for that. You

55:54.860 --> 55:58.860
know, honestly, if you have a decent sound card, it's gonna sound just the same. The

55:58.860 --> 56:04.020
Mac does not have anything that, you know, a decent sound card can't be better than.

56:04.020 --> 56:06.020
So, I don't really care.

56:08.020 --> 56:13.020
Honestly, the thing that I hated about the original Macs and stuff was the fact that everything was hardwired.

56:14.020 --> 56:17.020
And I still hate those stupid iMacs. Those things are dumb.

56:18.020 --> 56:22.020
You know, you can take the new G5s and put new hard drives in them and upgrade the RAM and everything.

56:23.020 --> 56:25.020
Yeah, it's about time that they got with the game.

56:26.020 --> 56:29.020
Just, they don't tell you you can do this. But you can.

56:29.020 --> 56:33.020
Alright kids, Skype line is open. Give us a call.

56:33.020 --> 56:37.020
It's about time to get those Intel processors in there as well.

56:37.020 --> 56:41.020
www.orangelandrater.com, click on Skype. If you want to talk about

56:41.020 --> 56:45.020
the lawsuit, you want to yell at Loki, although please kids, we can

56:45.020 --> 56:49.020
go back and forth on this all day long. This is the classic

56:49.020 --> 56:53.020
interweb debate, is Mac versus PC. I thought this debate ended

56:53.020 --> 56:57.020
like five years ago. Leave it to Loki to bring it back up.

56:57.020 --> 56:59.900
to the FUs of the week, because I've got a whole other thing

56:59.900 --> 57:02.260
that I'm going to re-bring up again.

57:02.260 --> 57:04.100
Goody, goody.

57:04.100 --> 57:05.580
All right.

57:05.580 --> 57:06.780
So the Skype line's open.

57:06.780 --> 57:09.620
If you want to call in www.orangeloungeradio.com,

57:09.620 --> 57:11.420
click on Interact With Us.

57:11.420 --> 57:12.340
Oh, and look at that.

57:12.340 --> 57:13.700
We're starting to get some phone calls.

57:13.700 --> 57:16.180
I think this one's really been wanting to get through.

57:16.180 --> 57:18.620
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

57:18.620 --> 57:20.260
Oh, I figured I'd come back.

57:20.260 --> 57:23.860
I've got to jump in on this Mac versus PC debate here.

57:23.860 --> 57:25.140
Can you guys hear us in studio?

57:25.140 --> 57:26.220
I've got first-hand experience on this.

57:26.220 --> 57:26.620
OK.

57:26.620 --> 57:31.420
Who's this? I work on these things. Introduce yourself please. Sorry, introduce yourself sir.

57:31.420 --> 57:38.460
I'm Reznor. I've called in a couple of times. You're the one that does the con on the East Coast, right?

57:38.460 --> 57:42.320
Yeah. Okay, I remember this guy. Alright. So what's on your mind?

57:42.320 --> 57:49.320
Well, I work on PCs and Mac day in and day out. I used to really hate Macs.

57:50.240 --> 57:52.500
And after working on them for about

57:52.500 --> 57:54.100
three months,

57:54.100 --> 57:58.500
Max can kick PC's asses all up and down the block.

57:58.500 --> 58:02.980
If I have to just fix another PC user that brought it in

58:02.980 --> 58:07.020
because their stupid kid downloaded Kaza and got Spyware

58:07.020 --> 58:09.620
all over it after I just cleaned it up, I'm going to

58:09.620 --> 58:10.980
scream.

58:10.980 --> 58:13.580
I'll give you that, because Max had been pretty, you know,

58:13.580 --> 58:16.900
because people assume that nobody uses Max, they haven't

58:16.900 --> 58:19.540
been as much of a target for the spyware and everything.

58:19.540 --> 58:20.140
You know, I think.

58:20.140 --> 58:23.820
We've had so many PC people just come in and just ditch,

58:23.820 --> 58:29.220
They had one guy trade in three PCs and bought two iMacs and a PowerBook on the spot

58:29.220 --> 58:33.020
because he was so sick and tired of his machine crashing and all sorts of crap.

58:33.020 --> 58:35.020
Well...

58:35.020 --> 58:39.420
Yep, those stupid users need a stupid computer, so it fits right in.

58:39.420 --> 58:42.620
Because, you know, goddamn retard's true.

58:42.620 --> 58:43.220
Honestly...

58:43.220 --> 58:47.220
I actually own both, so...

58:47.220 --> 58:50.820
There's things... Obviously the PC does gaming a lot better,

58:50.820 --> 58:53.820
But for everything else, I use my Mac for damn near anything.

58:53.820 --> 59:02.820
See, the thing I don't like about Macs is it's, for me, it seems like it's for the users that aren't really used to PC, you know, used to computing.

59:02.820 --> 59:05.820
They want something, I want to turn it on and be able to surf the web or something like that.

59:05.820 --> 59:07.820
And that's what Mac is good for.

59:07.820 --> 59:11.820
But for the people that like, you know, doing power stuff with their PC, Mac is...

59:11.820 --> 59:13.820
You like their power tools.

59:13.820 --> 59:15.820
They try to, they granny you to death.

59:15.820 --> 59:17.820
And Microsoft does the same thing, and I hate both.

59:17.820 --> 59:22.820
and I hate both. You know what it is? You like to build your own PCs, don't you? You like to jam stuff with that.

59:22.820 --> 59:26.780
That's why you don't like Macs, because Macs don't allow you that flexibility.

59:26.780 --> 59:30.180
You like being able to buy a part here. I'm gonna have to differ with them on this one.

59:30.180 --> 59:34.180
I've got about like six PCs laying around that I just built

59:34.180 --> 59:38.180
from just parts laying around. I'll build them day in, day out.

59:38.180 --> 59:41.740
But for the Mac, I'd like to be able to turn it on in three seconds and boot it up.

59:41.740 --> 59:45.580
I can just do stuff with it. I don't have to fool around with it, futz around with it.

59:45.580 --> 59:49.220
it always will work. I don't have to worry about something, you know, going bad.

59:49.220 --> 59:52.020
I don't have to worry about swapping parts in and out.

59:52.020 --> 59:55.700
It just works. You know what, though?

59:55.700 --> 59:59.080
To me, Apple sometimes... I can understand this side of it.

59:59.080 --> 01:00:02.740
Going in to buy an Apple is like going in to buy a Dell.

01:00:02.740 --> 01:00:06.700
I can't stand Dells either. I can't agree with you on that one.

01:00:06.700 --> 01:00:08.980
Buying an Apple is not like buying a Dell because...

01:00:08.980 --> 01:00:10.860
But not Dell......support for Dell.

01:00:10.860 --> 01:00:15.560
No, because the difference between a Dell and an Apple is Dell is sort of a put together

01:00:15.560 --> 01:00:18.520
piece of crap, except for my laptop, which is pretty nice.

01:00:18.520 --> 01:00:19.520
And apples actually work.

01:00:19.520 --> 01:00:20.520
That's pretty good analogy.

01:00:20.520 --> 01:00:24.400
A Dell is kind of like if you took a giant pile of shit and then you put a nice little

01:00:24.400 --> 01:00:29.000
case around it and you painted it black, whereas with an Apple, you actually put something

01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:30.760
useful in it and made it really small.

01:00:30.760 --> 01:00:35.680
But to one thing's sake in defense of Dell's, which I really do need to say, their PCs are

01:00:35.680 --> 01:00:38.000
crap but the laptops are pretty nice.

01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:42.960
I'm not talking about like the quality of service or anything like that because we all

01:00:42.960 --> 01:00:46.520
We all know Dell outsources their customer service, and Apple's got a pretty decent customer

01:00:46.520 --> 01:00:47.520
service setup.

01:00:47.520 --> 01:00:50.800
I'm not talking about that whole, like, the actual act of going in and purchasing, but

01:00:50.800 --> 01:00:54.840
I'm talking about that all-in-one feeling, where you're buying a computer in a box.

01:00:54.840 --> 01:00:58.960
I mean, let's face it, the Mac Mini is totally a computer in a box.

01:00:58.960 --> 01:01:02.520
Yes, you can mod those things, but the average user isn't going to be doing that.

01:01:02.520 --> 01:01:03.520
Right?

01:01:03.520 --> 01:01:04.520
Exactly.

01:01:04.520 --> 01:01:07.940
Whereas, to build a PC, you really have to think about, the average user really has no

01:01:07.940 --> 01:01:09.540
need to modify a Mini.

01:01:09.540 --> 01:01:10.540
That's why they buy a Mini.

01:01:10.540 --> 01:01:11.540
Yeah, I understand that.

01:01:11.540 --> 01:01:12.540
You plug it in and it works.

01:01:12.540 --> 01:01:16.540
for freaks like us who buy the mini and then mod the hell out of it.

01:01:16.540 --> 01:01:20.540
You're not a normal user, nor am I. I have an iBook, and I run Terminal on it.

01:01:20.540 --> 01:01:24.540
You run Linux! The instant you install...

01:01:24.540 --> 01:01:28.540
The minute you install Linux on anything, you are already reached geek levels.

01:01:28.540 --> 01:01:32.540
I only use it for server-side stuff.

01:01:32.540 --> 01:01:36.540
That's the cool thing about it!

01:01:36.540 --> 01:01:40.540
No, I know the Mac is Linux-based, but I'm talking about the

01:01:40.540 --> 01:01:43.040
Yeah, I'm talking about the hardcore stuff, okay?

01:01:43.040 --> 01:01:46.040
Because even though the Mac runs on Linux now, it is still a Mac.

01:01:46.040 --> 01:01:50.040
It still feels like the old black and white Macs that we used to play Number Munchers on, okay?

01:01:50.040 --> 01:01:52.040
Number Munchers!

01:01:52.040 --> 01:01:55.540
I always played Where in the World is Carmen Sandiegas, thank you very much.

01:01:55.540 --> 01:01:58.040
I played that on my Commodore 64, biatch.

01:01:58.040 --> 01:01:59.040
Dark Castle.

01:01:59.040 --> 01:02:02.040
Actually, I'd like to correct you. It would be black and green.

01:02:02.040 --> 01:02:04.040
Oh, I'm eating this old school shit up.

01:02:04.040 --> 01:02:06.040
Yeah, keep on going.

01:02:07.540 --> 01:02:10.040
Oregon Trail, yo.

01:02:10.040 --> 01:02:15.040
I just... Kix! Dude, where's Oregon Trail on the PSP? That's what we need!

01:02:15.040 --> 01:02:20.040
No, Kix on an Apple IIe. Oh my God! Kix! Oh my God!

01:02:20.040 --> 01:02:25.040
Was that the name of the Dark Castle? It was only on a Mac. They didn't have it on PC and you were going through...

01:02:25.040 --> 01:02:30.040
That game was sex. That was a great game. No, it was Kix and Lode Runner on an Apple IIe.

01:02:30.040 --> 01:02:35.040
Lode Runner. Oh my God. I've lost countless bets trying to beat high scores in that game.

01:02:35.040 --> 01:02:40.040
But see, all these games you all are talking about, they had on the Commodore 64.

01:02:40.040 --> 01:02:47.040
Hey, I remember sitting there with my Ti-94 computer with the cartridge crappy thing,

01:02:47.040 --> 01:02:52.040
trying to program little bouncing balls, blipping the little blippy music in BASIC.

01:02:52.040 --> 01:02:58.040
I remember loading BASIC stuff onto my, um, Ti-86, or not Ti-86.

01:02:58.040 --> 01:02:59.040
The Ti-85 calculator?

01:02:59.040 --> 01:03:01.040
No, not 85. It's the actual old, um...

01:03:01.040 --> 01:03:03.040
The Ti-99?

01:03:03.040 --> 01:03:11.040
No, it's the old Texas Instrument computer, not the calculator, actually the old computer, using a cassette tape, okay?

01:03:11.040 --> 01:03:13.040
Hey, I had one of those!

01:03:13.040 --> 01:03:17.040
You are the TI-99 and you dare to bash on Macs now?

01:03:17.040 --> 01:03:27.040
No, this was when I was five, and it wasn't a TI-99, it was my first computer, it was a Texas Instrument when I was five, and it's not, um, TI-99 was a calculator.

01:03:27.040 --> 01:03:32.960
I'm angry at my grandmother for throwing this thing away, but I had one of the old Coleco computers with a tape deck

01:03:33.160 --> 01:03:37.640
Yeah an atom. Oh geez and my grandma threw it away, and I was like no

01:03:38.160 --> 01:03:40.760
That's my Adam. You know I barely

01:03:41.920 --> 01:03:47.840
Interesting side story about Texas Instruments. I was the reason that they banned all the graphing calculators at my high school

01:03:47.840 --> 01:03:51.480
I was going there. I actually went out and sprung to get the

01:03:51.480 --> 01:03:57.480
the data transfer cable, and I downloaded tons of games for it, like multiplayer Tetris and everything,

01:03:57.480 --> 01:04:01.480
and I would bring them into school, and then transfer them to other people's calculators,

01:04:01.480 --> 01:04:06.480
and eventually, the entire 12th grade was doing nothing but playing games in class.

01:04:06.480 --> 01:04:10.480
They hadn't figured that out yet when I was in high school, because I had a nice graphing calculator,

01:04:10.480 --> 01:04:14.480
and I was in AP Calculus, and I was programming the complex formulas into my calculator,

01:04:14.480 --> 01:04:16.480
so I could cheat on all the tests.

01:04:16.480 --> 01:04:21.480
I found it very funny that, you know, I think I graduated a year ahead of you, right?

01:04:21.480 --> 01:04:26.480
I was playing pole position on those calculators in history class.

01:04:26.480 --> 01:04:31.480
I was flashing assembly onto my TI-82,

01:04:31.480 --> 01:04:36.480
and I was also programming a Final Fantasy battle system type thing,

01:04:36.480 --> 01:04:40.480
and then that's why I had to quit calculus, because I wasn't paying attention.

01:04:40.480 --> 01:04:42.480
Hey, I didn't pass algebra 2.

01:04:42.480 --> 01:04:44.480
You know what, I didn't take anything past geometry.

01:04:44.480 --> 01:04:48.480
I have to point this out. Dark Tetsuya is so winner for this comment in our chatroom.

01:04:48.480 --> 01:04:51.480
He wants an Oregon Trail MMO.

01:04:51.480 --> 01:04:52.480
No.

01:04:52.480 --> 01:04:53.480
Oh my god.

01:04:53.480 --> 01:04:56.480
Dude, Oregon Trail MMO would rock. Loki could die of dysentery.

01:04:56.480 --> 01:04:58.480
Yay!

01:04:58.480 --> 01:05:00.480
Oregon Trail Damacy.

01:05:00.480 --> 01:05:02.480
You know, honestly, that could work.

01:05:02.480 --> 01:05:06.480
An Oregon Trail MMO could so work. We need to get on that.

01:05:06.480 --> 01:05:09.480
Let's start an online petition because those rock.

01:05:09.480 --> 01:05:12.480
Yes, online petitions always do the trick.

01:05:12.480 --> 01:05:13.480
So that's what we should do.

01:05:13.480 --> 01:05:14.480
Oh yeah, they certainly do.

01:05:14.480 --> 01:05:16.000
We're going to make an online petition.

01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:20.000
We'll get it slash-dotted.

01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:22.600
Who the crap is going to play an Oregon Trail MMO?

01:05:22.600 --> 01:05:23.600
Me, motherfucker!

01:05:23.600 --> 01:05:24.600
Me!

01:05:24.600 --> 01:05:29.840
You get to Oregon, and then you have to build a castle, and then you can make a blacksmith

01:05:29.840 --> 01:05:32.320
and put shoes on horses.

01:05:32.320 --> 01:05:34.400
That's great fun.

01:05:34.400 --> 01:05:35.400
Well then, you go back.

01:05:35.400 --> 01:05:36.400
I mean, here's the thing.

01:05:36.400 --> 01:05:37.400
Get back to where?

01:05:37.400 --> 01:05:38.400
Go down to South American Castle.

01:05:38.400 --> 01:05:39.400
The New York Cale!

01:05:39.400 --> 01:05:46.880
When we talk about the Oregon Trail, we always talked about the people who were going out

01:05:46.880 --> 01:05:48.920
west to seek a better life.

01:05:48.920 --> 01:05:54.120
We never talked about those people that got there and then realized, this place sucks.

01:05:54.120 --> 01:05:55.120
Wagon's east.

01:05:55.120 --> 01:06:03.960
Any game where you can have four people die because your wagon flooded in a river that's

01:06:03.960 --> 01:06:07.000
two inches deep is retarded.

01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:13.000
I have major issues against Oregon Trail. Oregon Trail can be my home.

01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:15.000
OMG, need to make something more like Kingdom of Loathing.

01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:19.000
OMG, looking for party, need to cross river.

01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:21.000
Need cock.

01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:23.000
Fear Loathing in Oregon, yeah.

01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:25.000
Ify, morphine please.

01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:29.000
Looking for black mage who can cast float on my fucking racket.

01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:32.000
Ify, use the MRPH and PLZ.

01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:37.000
or more my favorite it's like when I'd go hunting I'd just kill everything and

01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:43.000
just like have way too much meat. You killed 40,000 pounds of meat but you could only carry

01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:47.000
a hundred. That used to happen to me all the time. Yeah PETA would be all over your ass

01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:51.000
in that MMO. I would I was killing buffalo like every buffalo was like. Hmm he smells

01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:58.000
like death. Yeah we're gonna give him a touch. I love the smell of decay in the morning.

01:06:58.000 --> 01:07:01.800
and then somebody's gonna have a speed hack and people are like hey you stole

01:07:01.800 --> 01:07:02.960
my bear kill

01:07:02.960 --> 01:07:06.920
oh my god someone unlocked the sex hack in Oregon Trail

01:07:06.920 --> 01:07:11.160
and all we're doing is a bunch of women showing their ankles

01:07:11.160 --> 01:07:16.640
ok we just unlocked this feature in Oregon Trail when we stop at the next fort

01:07:16.640 --> 01:07:20.880
you can either shop for wagon parts or you can stop in for hot coffee

01:07:20.880 --> 01:07:24.320
and then the new add-on where you steal the Indians land

01:07:24.320 --> 01:07:30.880
I like to know what the expansions are going to be. The Alaskan Trail!

01:07:30.880 --> 01:07:36.160
The Canadian Trail! Oh yeah, you'll have to dodge Mounties in their approach.

01:07:36.160 --> 01:07:39.160
The Pacific Trail, where they have the Constitution.

01:07:39.160 --> 01:07:42.620
I'm sorry, now I'm thinking of like, like a Ren and Simpy with the

01:07:42.620 --> 01:07:45.920
Royal Canadian Kilted Yaksman. No sir, I don't like it.

01:07:45.920 --> 01:07:53.160
Was there ever a sequel to the Oregon Trail, like a different trail?

01:07:53.160 --> 01:07:55.160
It was called Everybody's Dead!

01:07:55.160 --> 01:07:59.160
A remake of the original thing and it sucked. It sucked, really.

01:07:59.160 --> 01:08:01.160
They needed a sequel to The Oregon Trail.

01:08:01.160 --> 01:08:04.160
Every other number munchers got a sequel. They got word munchers.

01:08:04.160 --> 01:08:06.160
What else was there? What are the classics?

01:08:06.160 --> 01:08:07.160
There's only one Oregon.

01:08:07.160 --> 01:08:10.160
I could make a sequel of a historical Oregon Trail.

01:08:10.160 --> 01:08:12.160
How could you make another Oregon?

01:08:12.160 --> 01:08:14.160
Oregon Trail 2.

01:08:14.160 --> 01:08:20.160
Oregon Trail 2 is back and it's pissed.

01:08:20.160 --> 01:08:26.160
Oh, she's just taking the Oregon Trail through the ghetto now, she doesn't have to worry about drive-bys and crack whores.

01:08:26.160 --> 01:08:27.160
Oakland Trail.

01:08:27.160 --> 01:08:29.160
Are you John Connor?

01:08:31.160 --> 01:08:34.160
If it's going to go through the ghetto, it would have to be Oakland Trail.

01:08:34.160 --> 01:08:38.160
There has to be another trail somewhere in the world that they could do a game off of.

01:08:38.160 --> 01:08:39.160
The Iraqi Trail!

01:08:39.160 --> 01:08:40.160
There you go!

01:08:42.160 --> 01:08:45.160
You've got to make it down the sand road.

01:08:45.160 --> 01:08:47.160
Trail of a Thousand Tears, we can do it.

01:08:47.160 --> 01:08:54.160
Dropping sandwiches. Puerto Rican trail.

01:08:54.800 --> 01:08:59.120
Yes, this gets my vote as the most politically incorrect episode ever.

01:08:59.120 --> 01:09:01.720
That's alright. It's a landmark number. We're okay.

01:09:01.720 --> 01:09:06.280
What number is it? I've been like out of circulation. It's one fifty tonight. It's divisible by fifty.

01:09:06.280 --> 01:09:08.300
Yes, it's divisible by fifty.

01:09:08.300 --> 01:09:10.720
And two. Holy crap, I need another bear on that.

01:09:10.720 --> 01:09:13.240
Alright, yeah, me too. I think so. Alright.

01:09:13.240 --> 01:09:16.640
Reznor, any other closing thoughts? I gotta get some other calls, but we do enjoy

01:09:16.640 --> 01:09:19.880
having you on the show. You bring out the old school in us. I appreciate it.

01:09:19.880 --> 01:09:24.720
Hey, you gotta keep in touch with your roots. Hell yes we do. So that's all I use my PSP

01:09:24.720 --> 01:09:29.680
for, Kid Icarus. Woot. Alright, I'll let you go. Have a good one, my friend, and take

01:09:29.680 --> 01:09:37.100
care. Thanks for the call. Later. That was a fun call. Turtle, the MMO. Let's take another

01:09:37.100 --> 01:09:42.520
call. Oregon Trail 2, Arcade Edition. Anyway, uh, hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio, who's

01:09:42.520 --> 01:09:44.520
They're on Oregon Trail Radio.

01:09:44.520 --> 01:09:48.520
Sephiroth1215 and SSJ100Matt and many other people.

01:09:48.520 --> 01:09:53.520
Many other people? Are you having like an Orange Lounge listening party or something?

01:09:53.520 --> 01:09:54.520
Yes.

01:09:54.520 --> 01:09:55.520
Orgy!

01:09:55.520 --> 01:09:58.520
It's the Orange Lounge orgy, that's awesome.

01:09:58.520 --> 01:10:00.520
We have hit a new level of tastelessness.

01:10:00.520 --> 01:10:01.520
Wow.

01:10:01.520 --> 01:10:02.520
Congratulations us.

01:10:02.520 --> 01:10:05.520
People have moved from having Buffy parties to having Orange Lounge parties.

01:10:05.520 --> 01:10:07.520
That makes me feel kind of cool.

01:10:07.520 --> 01:10:09.520
Anyway, what's on your mind guys?

01:10:09.520 --> 01:10:17.520
Uh, not much. There's someone that wants to talk about the Mac and PC thing.

01:10:17.520 --> 01:10:19.520
Goody goody, put them on.

01:10:19.520 --> 01:10:20.520
Alright.

01:10:20.520 --> 01:10:25.520
Who's this? Introduce yourself.

01:10:25.520 --> 01:10:27.520
I'm Chris D'Cruz.

01:10:27.520 --> 01:10:29.520
Hello, how are you?

01:10:29.520 --> 01:10:31.520
Quite frankly, I don't care if you know my real name.

01:10:31.520 --> 01:10:33.520
Alright, that's fine.

01:10:33.520 --> 01:10:40.520
About the Mac and Intel thing, they're saying how you can run virtual PC on a Mac and play any of the PC games.

01:10:40.520 --> 01:10:44.520
Emulators cause massive slowdown. It's not feasible at all.

01:10:44.520 --> 01:10:46.520
I know people have done it.

01:10:46.520 --> 01:10:53.520
In the chat room it was kind of brought up, we kind of addressed this during the break, that it's more, if you want to play the DOS-based games, you'd be okay.

01:10:53.520 --> 01:10:58.520
Yes, the DOS-based games. But say, for example, Battlefield 2 is not going to be running.

01:10:58.520 --> 01:11:01.520
No, no, but you know what, if you want to play Battlefield 2, you really should just don't.

01:11:01.520 --> 01:11:02.520
Who wants to play that crap?

01:11:02.520 --> 01:11:05.880
well look if you want to play Battlefield 2 you should own a PC anyway

01:11:05.880 --> 01:11:09.400
I'm talking about Ragnarok and PSO which I play on my laptop

01:11:09.400 --> 01:11:13.200
well PSO and Ragnarok

01:11:13.200 --> 01:11:16.760
oh Ragnarok is what? sprite based? and PSO is

01:11:16.760 --> 01:11:20.080
six years old? well

01:11:20.080 --> 01:11:23.560
the PC versions new but you're right I don't give a shit about Final Fantasy 11

01:11:23.560 --> 01:11:24.800
I think that game is ass

01:11:24.800 --> 01:11:28.920
well Final Fantasy 11 is horrible! which is why I quit it twice

01:11:28.920 --> 01:11:42.920
Look, my response to the fact that the PC emulators on a Mac will play DOS-based games is I said, well then it will play ZZT and that's all you need. Honestly.

01:11:42.920 --> 01:11:45.920
My DS will play DOS-based games, I don't understand your point.

01:11:45.920 --> 01:11:48.920
I want ZZT on the PSV.

01:11:48.920 --> 01:11:54.920
Go buy a PassMe and blank ROM cartridges and just install everything on there.

01:11:54.920 --> 01:11:58.640
all right

01:11:58.640 --> 01:12:02.360
anything else you want to share on the whole Mac vs PC thing? I think they're demanding me to get

01:12:02.360 --> 01:12:04.360
off this before you kick everyone else off

01:12:04.360 --> 01:12:07.760
alright alright thanks for your input

01:12:07.760 --> 01:12:12.680
we're getting passed around like a bong at this party

01:12:12.680 --> 01:12:17.480
what's up?

01:12:17.480 --> 01:12:20.540
first of all I'd like to ask you're gonna be on the

01:12:20.540 --> 01:12:24.560
East Coast in a few weeks and are you gonna be anywhere else but the

01:12:24.560 --> 01:12:31.280
place in New Jersey? Am I making any more live appearances, so to speak? No, nobody's

01:12:31.280 --> 01:12:37.000
really asked. I'm actually going out there for work, so my Monday through Fridays are

01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:41.360
kind of booked with the real-world work stuff, but on the weekend I'm open to suggestions.

01:12:41.360 --> 01:12:46.440
If you have something, just email me and I'll see what I can do. Alright then, we'll see.

01:12:46.440 --> 01:12:50.520
But the New Jersey thing right now is definite. I want to do the New Jersey tournament because

01:12:50.520 --> 01:12:53.000
I haven't been to a DDR tournament in like years, so I think it would be funny to go

01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:55.720
to go to one on the east coast for the first time, so.

01:12:55.720 --> 01:12:57.480
Make sure you take those plugs, it kinda smells.

01:12:57.480 --> 01:12:58.480
Stop it.

01:12:58.480 --> 01:12:59.480
It does!

01:12:59.480 --> 01:13:01.480
I was in Philadelphia, it smelled like New Jersey!

01:13:01.480 --> 01:13:02.480
Anyway.

01:13:02.480 --> 01:13:06.640
Well, I've been there, it wasn't all that great, but it was alright.

01:13:06.640 --> 01:13:07.640
What's on your mind?

01:13:07.640 --> 01:13:09.800
Didn't you go to some con recently you wanted to share with us?

01:13:09.800 --> 01:13:12.680
Yeah, I went to Kineticon yesterday.

01:13:12.680 --> 01:13:16.920
They had their own DDR tournament there, but it was not that great, first of all.

01:13:16.920 --> 01:13:18.560
Yeah, it was all noobs.

01:13:18.560 --> 01:13:20.240
What is there to do at Kineticon?

01:13:20.240 --> 01:13:21.520
What is there to do at Kineticon?

01:13:21.520 --> 01:13:31.120
by the way is a very cute name, I must say. Basically anything fantasy, sci-fi, nerd stuff.

01:13:31.120 --> 01:13:34.000
So it's kind of like a Comic-Con. Yeah, there's a big furry thing if you want to know that.

01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:39.640
A big, oh, it's a furry convention, how lovely. No, no, no, no. That was just a large part

01:13:39.640 --> 01:13:44.760
of it. Oh, well, okay. So it's kind of like at an Anime-Con out here, hentai is always

01:13:44.760 --> 01:13:50.680
a big part of it no matter what. You can't escape it. No, hentai was big there too. So,

01:13:50.680 --> 01:13:57.180
Yeah, there was a big gaming room for anything gaming, huge screens, whatever.

01:13:57.180 --> 01:14:00.180
Did you get to play any new import game type things for the first time?

01:14:00.180 --> 01:14:06.180
No, I didn't get to. There was good stuff, but...

01:14:06.180 --> 01:14:10.180
I've been to Connecticut, it's not that awful.

01:14:10.180 --> 01:14:12.180
It's better than Delaware.

01:14:12.180 --> 01:14:15.180
It's better than Delaware, come on!

01:14:15.180 --> 01:14:17.180
There's not much to do in Connecticut.

01:14:17.180 --> 01:14:18.680
There's not much to do in Delaware.

01:14:18.680 --> 01:14:25.560
Maybe it's just because I was only in Connecticut for two days, so like, I saw everything in those two days or something, but Connecticut wasn't that bad. I actually kind of enjoyed myself.

01:14:25.560 --> 01:14:26.800
You stretched it out to two days?

01:14:26.800 --> 01:14:28.560
Dare I say it, I spent two days in Connecticut.

01:14:28.560 --> 01:14:30.560
You stretched it out to two days? That's amazing.

01:14:32.560 --> 01:14:34.320
There's like, Hartford and Stanford.

01:14:35.440 --> 01:14:37.840
I was in Hartford. I didn't see Stanford.

01:14:38.160 --> 01:14:39.360
Stanford's where all the beer comes from.

01:14:39.360 --> 01:14:43.400
Anyway, I'm sorry. I will make Bug be quiet. Um, what else is on your mind?

01:14:44.080 --> 01:14:46.400
Um, I'm gonna put SJ100 Matt on.

01:14:46.400 --> 01:14:47.200
Sounds good.

01:14:47.200 --> 01:14:50.200
Puff, puff, pass. Hi.

01:14:50.200 --> 01:14:52.200
Yep. Hey, how's it going?

01:14:52.200 --> 01:14:54.200
Uh, good.

01:14:54.200 --> 01:14:59.200
Yeah, I'm going to elaborate a little bit more since Sephiroth is playing Smash Brothers, so...

01:14:59.200 --> 01:15:03.200
What? He's playing video games while he's trying to talk to us?

01:15:03.200 --> 01:15:05.200
Yes, we got several people here.

01:15:05.200 --> 01:15:07.200
He's trying to play video games and losing badly.

01:15:07.200 --> 01:15:08.200
Alright.

01:15:08.200 --> 01:15:10.200
Okay, anyways, um...

01:15:10.200 --> 01:15:12.200
I can edit all of you at Smash Brothers.

01:15:12.200 --> 01:15:15.200
Oh, they might take you up on that, be careful.

01:15:15.200 --> 01:15:19.640

01:15:31.480 --> 01:15:32.480
the it would

01:15:32.480 --> 01:15:36.480
canada college really good in the fact that it had

01:15:36.480 --> 01:15:38.800
a lot of workshops a lot of uh...

01:15:38.800 --> 01:15:43.240
screenings they had about eight for nine screening rooms mhm just

01:15:43.240 --> 01:15:50.240
They had several rooms that were about two-thirds the size of a football field.

01:15:50.240 --> 01:16:01.240
They had different sorts of gaming, like they had miniature gaming, magic cards, and other card game matches going on.

01:16:01.240 --> 01:16:04.240
Dude, magic cards are still around?

01:16:04.240 --> 01:16:05.240
Yeah.

01:16:05.240 --> 01:16:06.240
Wow.

01:16:06.240 --> 01:16:08.240
My coworker participates in tournaments.

01:16:08.240 --> 01:16:10.240
Oh my god, that was like ten years ago I was in a magic card.

01:16:10.240 --> 01:16:15.240
I'm not knocking the Magic Cards thing, but I'm just saying, wow, I can't believe it has this longevity going on with it.

01:16:15.240 --> 01:16:18.240
This is crazy. Anyway, sorry.

01:16:18.240 --> 01:16:26.240
But, yeah, the gaming room, they had a Smash Brothers tournament going on, and they had a Halo 2 tournament going on.

01:16:26.240 --> 01:16:29.240
How was the Smash Brothers tournament? I like that game.

01:16:29.240 --> 01:16:42.240
Well actually we kind of entered it but we didn't go to it because it was like a couple hour preliminary rounds and all that so we didn't have time for that.

01:16:42.240 --> 01:16:43.240
Gotcha.

01:16:43.240 --> 01:16:50.240
But we donated a GameCube for a short time which actually gave us tickets to the next Kineticon for free.

01:16:50.240 --> 01:16:53.240
Oh there you go. How often do they have Kineticon? Just once a year?

01:16:53.240 --> 01:16:58.240
Once a year. This was the first time that they had it in the big Hartford Convention Center.

01:16:58.240 --> 01:17:02.240
Alright, Han. For Connecticut, that's big. That's really big.

01:17:02.240 --> 01:17:06.240
Well, yeah, well...

01:17:06.240 --> 01:17:10.240
I'm pasting a link to the pictures on

01:17:10.240 --> 01:17:14.240
the chat room, no one wants to see, but...

01:17:14.240 --> 01:17:18.240
Right on. I hope our listeners want to check that out. Especially if they're on the East Coast and missed it. Then they can see everything

01:17:18.240 --> 01:17:22.240
they missed, and they'll go next year.

01:17:22.240 --> 01:17:26.240
And they had a beatmania tournament.

01:17:26.240 --> 01:17:30.400
What style were they doing the BeatMania thing on?

01:17:30.400 --> 01:17:34.320
I heard someone mention 8, but I'm not positive.

01:17:34.320 --> 01:17:35.240
Um...

01:17:35.240 --> 01:17:40.200
Poppin' Music, I think they had some sort of tournament to win like a Naruto

01:17:40.200 --> 01:17:44.480
customized Poppin' Music pad or something.

01:17:44.480 --> 01:17:46.220
Which looked interesting, but...

01:17:46.220 --> 01:17:47.080
Um...

01:17:47.080 --> 01:17:50.540
And then of course the dealer room, which was interesting.

01:17:50.540 --> 01:17:53.320
And uh... plenty of uh... cosplays.

01:17:53.320 --> 01:17:54.680
Any um... any

01:17:54.680 --> 01:17:57.520

01:19:23.420 --> 01:19:26.420
There's 12 people over there?

01:19:26.420 --> 01:19:27.420
In a tiny room, yes.

01:19:27.420 --> 01:19:30.420
Dude, that's more people than listen to our show regularly.

01:19:30.420 --> 01:19:31.420
And everyone's fully clothed.

01:19:31.420 --> 01:19:32.420
Yeah.

01:19:32.420 --> 01:19:33.420
All right.

01:19:33.420 --> 01:19:38.420
Who I might add are actually voting for you on that whole thing that you have.

01:19:38.420 --> 01:19:40.420
Oh, the podcast awards thing?

01:19:40.420 --> 01:19:41.420
Yes.

01:19:41.420 --> 01:19:42.420
Thank you kindly.

01:19:42.420 --> 01:19:43.420
I didn't even remember to mention this.

01:19:43.420 --> 01:19:46.420
We got nominated, Best Gaming Podcast, over on PodcastAwards.com.

01:19:46.420 --> 01:19:50.660
uh... go vote for us because we like attention

01:19:50.660 --> 01:19:53.680
well actually i have a quick little quick little story that happened in

01:19:53.680 --> 01:19:55.480
connecticut all right

01:19:55.480 --> 01:20:02.260
uh... my buddy separate uh... was playing what's on

01:20:02.260 --> 01:20:04.380
least one hundred seconds

01:20:04.380 --> 01:20:06.400
heavy and uh...

01:20:06.400 --> 01:20:08.360
this little

01:20:08.360 --> 01:20:12.140
this little fat kid i'm not i'm being me with the fact that uh...

01:20:12.140 --> 01:20:16.080
he just started being really rude and saying that he's awful

01:20:16.080 --> 01:20:19.520
and I basically stuck up for him

01:20:19.520 --> 01:20:23.800
and saved him. Could this kid even play

01:20:23.800 --> 01:20:27.880
2DX? Because I've had the kids at Roseville Golf Land that are like 12 years old

01:20:27.880 --> 01:20:29.440
try to make fun of me

01:20:29.440 --> 01:20:33.080
and then it's like you know well dude if you're so good at DDR you wanna play a

01:20:33.080 --> 01:20:35.960
match against me I'll pick the song you know healing vision angelic makes for

01:20:35.960 --> 01:20:36.360
something

01:20:36.360 --> 01:20:40.120
that's what I hinted at to him it's like well

01:20:40.120 --> 01:20:43.320
I've seen him play a couple times but you know

01:20:43.320 --> 01:20:48.320
He plays on 1.5 and 2x, and if you don't do that, you're considered a noob.

01:20:48.320 --> 01:20:55.320
But, you know what, I didn't want to get into an argument with him.

01:20:55.320 --> 01:20:59.320
I didn't want to be mean to him because he's like a 16-year-old kid.

01:20:59.320 --> 01:21:07.320
I think with his overweightness, I'm sure life has already dealt a poor hand to him.

01:21:07.320 --> 01:21:12.320
Yeah, you sometimes wonder what happens to children to make them turn out so strange.

01:21:12.320 --> 01:21:18.320
Yeah, but you know, he was very rude, so I had to step in and save my friend over here.

01:21:18.320 --> 01:21:22.320
But other than that, Kineticon was very good.

01:21:22.320 --> 01:21:24.320
I have one thing to say.

01:21:24.320 --> 01:21:25.320
Oh, he has one thing to say.

01:21:25.320 --> 01:21:29.320
I got to meet Tiffany Grant, who is also the voice of Asuka.

01:21:29.320 --> 01:21:31.320
Right on.

01:21:31.320 --> 01:21:36.320
And also, we met Piano Squall, if you know who that is.

01:21:36.320 --> 01:21:39.320
No idea.

01:21:39.320 --> 01:21:44.600
I have to be honest, I don't follow the anime thing that closely, like I like some of it, but...

01:21:44.600 --> 01:21:48.400
There's one thing that you're going to be jealous of, and we got to meet Freeze Pop.

01:21:48.400 --> 01:21:50.080
That's awesome!

01:21:50.080 --> 01:21:51.840
I am jealous!

01:21:51.840 --> 01:21:53.200
I am jealous.

01:21:53.200 --> 01:21:56.400
I got to meet Togo at E3, that was kind of cool.

01:21:56.400 --> 01:21:59.360
Do I get a cookie for that? I don't know.

01:21:59.360 --> 01:22:04.160
Alright, we're going to let you go so you guys can get back to your party, we'll get back to our show.

01:22:04.160 --> 01:22:05.540
That's alright.

01:22:05.540 --> 01:22:08.040
For twelve people I can make the time.

01:22:08.040 --> 01:22:10.600
That's like, that's twice our normal listenership.

01:22:10.600 --> 01:22:11.240
That's huge.

01:22:11.240 --> 01:22:12.080
All right?

01:22:12.080 --> 01:22:12.600
OK.

01:22:12.600 --> 01:22:14.400
All right, have a good time, kids.

01:22:14.400 --> 01:22:14.840
OK.

01:22:14.840 --> 01:22:15.360
All right.

01:22:15.360 --> 01:22:15.860
Bye.

01:22:15.860 --> 01:22:16.360
Bye.

01:22:16.360 --> 01:22:16.860
Bye.

01:22:19.560 --> 01:22:20.560
Oh, my gosh.

01:22:20.560 --> 01:22:21.980
Orange Lounge listening parties.

01:22:21.980 --> 01:22:23.160
Who would have thought?

01:22:23.160 --> 01:22:25.000
All right, we're going to go to a break, kids.

01:22:25.000 --> 01:22:25.880
When we come back from this break,

01:22:25.880 --> 01:22:28.360
we're going to do the cage match, some other news going on.

01:22:28.360 --> 01:22:30.040
We're doing happy sky music tonight.

01:22:30.040 --> 01:22:31.760
Going to continue on with that theme.

01:22:31.760 --> 01:22:32.640
We're going to have in this break,

01:22:32.640 --> 01:22:34.720
we're going to have a song, a brand new Kiriyama Oka

01:22:34.720 --> 01:22:35.840
song that's going to start it off.

01:22:35.840 --> 01:22:39.860
We're going to have a song that's actually a papa music crossover in this break as well,

01:22:39.860 --> 01:22:42.800
and a song named after a dog will all be in this break.

01:22:42.800 --> 01:22:48.000
So we'll be back with more Orange Lounge Radio and the Cage Match and the FUs of the week,

01:22:48.000 --> 01:22:51.440
maybe some Ask Orange Lounge if we have time, and if we get around to it, some actual DDR

01:22:51.440 --> 01:22:52.440
news.

01:26:22.440 --> 01:26:24.440

01:29:14.420 --> 01:29:17.420
Every day, tiny, you don't be patient

01:29:17.420 --> 01:29:20.420
But as fine as mine, you believe in me

01:29:21.420 --> 01:29:23.420
If it's raining again

01:29:24.420 --> 01:29:26.420
Nobody wanna cry

01:29:27.420 --> 01:29:30.420
Like the fire of my love

01:29:30.420 --> 01:29:35.420
Oh, girl, we promise every day

01:29:35.420 --> 01:29:37.420
Go to work in the park

01:29:37.420 --> 01:29:41.420
Oh, we promise every day

01:29:41.420 --> 01:29:43.420
Go to work with the train

01:29:43.420 --> 01:29:46.420
You will forget about the day

01:29:46.420 --> 01:29:50.420
Who's loving and sleeping if you don't follow the game

01:30:20.420 --> 01:30:26.260
The two walking apart are we from each other again

01:30:26.260 --> 01:30:29.860
The two of us is a chain you will forget

01:30:29.860 --> 01:30:34.860
That's why I'll be dating somebody else with it if you don't, I don't wanna get it

01:30:59.860 --> 01:31:07.020
Hello, boys and girls, we are back with Orange Lounge Radio. Hope you enjoyed some of the

01:31:07.020 --> 01:31:12.940
songs you heard in that break. Brand new Akira Yomoko song. Vatum Selarum from Papa Music

01:31:12.940 --> 01:31:18.900
making its way over into 2DX, Happy Sky. Zephyr, a very epic song in there, and then Y&Co,

01:31:18.900 --> 01:31:25.960
folks behind Monkey Dance, Daisuke. Their new song, Poodle! Cute. Well, oh, I see you

01:31:25.960 --> 01:31:29.520
over there Dark Sakura reading the new Harry Potter I did the same thing last

01:31:29.520 --> 01:31:33.680
time I do remember when that God this show's been on a long time because I

01:31:33.680 --> 01:31:37.560
remember when the last book came out I want to say when Goblet of Fire came out

01:31:37.560 --> 01:31:40.400
you were on here too but I think that might have been before actually yeah I

01:31:40.400 --> 01:31:45.480
was were you oh my gosh so I gotta ask you about this because this was

01:31:45.480 --> 01:31:48.040
something that was kind of pissing me off but it seems like there's there's

01:31:48.040 --> 01:31:53.000
kids on the internet that that are loving spoiling this new book what do

01:31:53.000 --> 01:31:58.300
think about this whole thing the spoiler so what well but you have the option of

01:31:58.300 --> 01:32:01.260
reading it or not no no but there's people like that have gone on live

01:32:01.260 --> 01:32:04.140
journal and they'll post it in their journal not behind a cut in really big

01:32:04.140 --> 01:32:07.700
font the big spoiler so that all their friends nobody's done that on mine well

01:32:07.700 --> 01:32:11.620
because they know you'll defend their ass but I've seen it on mine I wouldn't

01:32:11.620 --> 01:32:17.420
do that that's petty but but to post a spoiler is petty isn't it I didn't know

01:32:17.420 --> 01:32:22.460
anyone of it it's rude but it's not something that's worth all the sudden

01:32:22.460 --> 01:32:26.040
not being somebody's friend over. Well, I would just be...

01:32:26.040 --> 01:32:29.500
It would depend... I think it would really depend on how close you were with somebody

01:32:29.500 --> 01:32:32.100
in the first place, though. If it's just somebody you just kind of knew on the internet, they

01:32:32.100 --> 01:32:34.760
added you because they thought their LJ was cool. But if it was like somebody I knew in

01:32:34.760 --> 01:32:38.680
real life, I wouldn't do it, but... I don't know.

01:32:38.680 --> 01:32:41.500
Nobody has posted any big, fonted spoilers on my LiveJournal.

01:32:41.500 --> 01:32:45.100
Yeah, I just think... You know, let people have their thing.

01:32:45.100 --> 01:32:47.820
I think it has to do with the general character of the people I've been friending.

01:32:47.820 --> 01:32:50.640
Well, that's good, but I mean, I think... I'm just kind of like, you know what, let

01:32:50.640 --> 01:32:54.020
people have their thing you might be making fun of the Harry Potter thing but

01:32:54.020 --> 01:32:58.420
let's face it you listen to a DDR radio show I'm not talking about you guys

01:32:58.420 --> 01:33:01.180
specifically I don't think anybody listens to this show is in on this but

01:33:01.180 --> 01:33:06.820
you know the people that when people that are posting spoilers this is like

01:33:06.820 --> 01:33:10.700
you know what and then they go oh I'm spoiling it because Harry Potter fanboys

01:33:10.700 --> 01:33:13.940
are stupid and I'm just like you know what you probably got your stupid thing

01:33:13.940 --> 01:33:19.680
too how would you like me to go take a dump on that just I already know what's

01:33:19.680 --> 01:33:28.960
gonna happen yeah I don't care for me it's how they get there anyway I decided

01:33:28.960 --> 01:33:32.300
I would have a Guinness in celebration of our 150th episode I'm having a

01:33:32.300 --> 01:33:35.560
celebratory drink since I don't have to drive tonight I'm having an upset

01:33:35.560 --> 01:33:39.560
stomach I'm supposed to plug something they actually made a chat room called

01:33:39.560 --> 01:33:46.440
channel Oregon Trail to discuss the latest news and events behind

01:33:46.440 --> 01:33:52.620
everybody's favorite upcoming MMO the Oregon Trail strikes back so join that

01:33:52.620 --> 01:34:00.120
channel it's a good time all right anyway let's see moving on with other

01:34:00.120 --> 01:34:04.940
news going on throughout the gaming world and the Bahmani world DDR with

01:34:04.940 --> 01:34:09.140
Mario had their site open up and it actually happened a little while ago but

01:34:09.140 --> 01:34:11.380
it kind of happened under the radar because I think a lot of people might

01:34:11.380 --> 01:34:15.300
have given up on DDR with Mario once they heard that despite the fact that

01:34:15.300 --> 01:34:21.020
that it's going to have an awesome soundtrack, the dance itself is kind of blah. Like, by

01:34:21.020 --> 01:34:22.580
the way, when I played DDR with Mario...

01:34:22.580 --> 01:34:24.940
What do you mean, like, DDR oh-ha stuff?

01:34:24.940 --> 01:34:29.780
It kind of is, stepwise. When I played DDR with Mario at E3, I triple-A'd my first song,

01:34:29.780 --> 01:34:33.980
and I played it on, like, heavy or whatever it was. I don't think it was the hardest,

01:34:33.980 --> 01:34:37.780
hardest difficulty, because not all songs had that, but it was, like, one below it.

01:34:37.780 --> 01:34:41.180
And it was about the equivalent of 5-footer, and I triple-A'd it. And I'm not the type

01:34:41.180 --> 01:34:45.540
type of person that sits there and AAAs all these songs on DDR. I mean, I've done some,

01:34:45.540 --> 01:34:53.900
but I'm by no means, like, this excellent DDR player. So, DDR Mario's kind of simple.

01:34:53.900 --> 01:34:58.320
But the Japanese site opened up for DDR with Mario, because I believe the game actually

01:34:58.320 --> 01:35:01.900
might have come out in Japan. I have to be honest, I haven't really been following this.

01:35:01.900 --> 01:35:08.820
Oh, it did, just a few days ago. July 14th was the release date in Japan. So, there you

01:35:08.820 --> 01:35:13.500
And you can look at the website and look at all the features and all that stuff, although

01:35:13.500 --> 01:35:16.320
it's all in Japanese, so unless you can read Japanese, you're not going to be able to read

01:35:16.320 --> 01:35:20.500
it unless you run it through like, you know, a translator or something.

01:35:20.500 --> 01:35:25.700
But anyway, so I guess that's some big Bawani news.

01:35:25.700 --> 01:35:29.060
I think it's interesting because there's still a lot of speculation going on with the new

01:35:29.060 --> 01:35:33.760
DDRs coming out, Extreme 2 and UltraMix 3, just kind of been keeping a pulse on what's

01:35:33.760 --> 01:35:37.140
going on on the DDR Freak threads, which is where the majority of the discussion has been

01:35:37.140 --> 01:35:38.140
occurring.

01:35:38.140 --> 01:35:44.140
I think a lot of people were expecting Extreme 2 to make a debut at Comic-Con, the fuller version,

01:35:44.140 --> 01:35:48.140
because last year, you may or may not remember, DDR Extreme ended up getting shown at Comic-Con,

01:35:48.140 --> 01:35:54.140
and it was, like, a damn near final build, so we found out a lot of songs that were actually going to be in DDR Extreme

01:35:54.140 --> 01:35:59.140
because it was shown at Comic-Con. Well, rumor came out that Konami was going to be back at this year's Comic-Con,

01:35:59.140 --> 01:36:05.140
and sure enough, they're there, but they're showing off Yu-Gi-Oh! and Turtles and their comic-related games.

01:36:05.140 --> 01:36:09.740
not showing DDR this year so unfortunately no new DDR news but it's

01:36:09.740 --> 01:36:13.060
kind of interesting as somebody pointed out this game is supposed to be coming

01:36:13.060 --> 01:36:15.600
out you remember the release date on this Loki I know you said a while ago

01:36:15.600 --> 01:36:22.540
was it September end of September September 20 something 21st 21st still

01:36:22.540 --> 01:36:26.380
this that's still the date I think the only one that got pushed back was

01:36:26.380 --> 01:36:31.020
Karaoke Revolution party got pushed back one week later so it's not coming out

01:36:31.020 --> 01:36:35.020
It's coming out the same day as UltraMix 3. It's coming out the week after that.

01:36:35.020 --> 01:36:38.020
I heard some things were going on at the Karaoke Revolution Party, but I can't talk about them.

01:36:38.020 --> 01:36:41.020
You can tell me, because I pretty much know everything that's going on.

01:36:41.020 --> 01:36:42.020
I can't. I can't. Anyway.

01:36:42.020 --> 01:36:43.020
Why can't you tell me?

01:36:43.020 --> 01:36:45.020
Let's have this discussion off air, please.

01:36:45.020 --> 01:36:50.020
Alright. But it's going to rock. You all should pick that up.

01:36:50.020 --> 01:36:59.020
And then there's UltraMix 3, which I think is interesting because one of the very most recent posts in the UltraMix 3 thread

01:36:59.020 --> 01:37:02.600
by somebody who's actually in our chat room right now, Renee.

01:37:02.600 --> 01:37:05.720
Although I always want to say Rene, because there's so many E's.

01:37:05.720 --> 01:37:07.420
I'm going to get punched for saying that.

01:37:07.420 --> 01:37:10.920
But it actually referenced our own site and the lovely DarkSakras,

01:37:10.920 --> 01:37:11.800
her photo gallery.

01:37:11.800 --> 01:37:15.040
Remember how you took just a shitload of pictures of E3 of everything?

01:37:15.040 --> 01:37:15.520
Yeah.

01:37:15.520 --> 01:37:18.320
Well, somebody finally decided to look at the pictures

01:37:18.320 --> 01:37:19.640
and think, you know what?

01:37:19.640 --> 01:37:22.160
DarkSakras' pictures actually show all this stuff

01:37:22.160 --> 01:37:24.760
about UltraMix 3 we didn't realize before.

01:37:24.760 --> 01:37:26.920
Why do you think I took so many damn pictures of it?

01:37:26.920 --> 01:37:30.140
And I haven't even posted my pictures yet.

01:37:30.140 --> 01:37:31.840
And I took some nice high res pictures,

01:37:31.840 --> 01:37:34.920
but I don't think I have a whole lot that you didn't have.

01:37:34.920 --> 01:37:36.920
I think Dark Soccer really touched on everything

01:37:36.920 --> 01:37:39.920
that I might have gotten a picture of.

01:37:39.920 --> 01:37:41.920
But the things that were shown here,

01:37:41.920 --> 01:37:43.360
Emmy being in a schoolgirl outfit.

01:37:43.360 --> 01:37:45.400
I didn't realize people didn't know that before.

01:37:45.400 --> 01:37:47.740
But yes, Emmy was in a schoolgirl outfit in the E3 demo,

01:37:47.740 --> 01:37:48.440
and it was cute.

01:37:48.440 --> 01:37:49.120
I liked it.

01:37:49.120 --> 01:37:50.800
Just like the graduation video.

01:37:50.800 --> 01:37:52.800
Hm?

01:37:52.800 --> 01:37:53.600
Yeah.

01:37:53.600 --> 01:37:56.600
I liked Slut Emi better though, for Ultramix 2.

01:37:56.600 --> 01:37:58.600
Slut Emi was a piece of shit.

01:38:00.600 --> 01:38:02.600
I liked Slut Emi too, actually.

01:38:02.600 --> 01:38:04.600
It was a lot of fan service, though.

01:38:06.600 --> 01:38:09.600
If you guys got Slut Emi, I'd get Pantsless Rage.

01:38:11.600 --> 01:38:12.600
Anyway.

01:38:14.600 --> 01:38:17.600
No, no, it's not three-titted Emi, it's only, you know, Slut Emi.

01:38:17.600 --> 01:38:18.600
So you'd have to get-

01:38:18.600 --> 01:38:20.600
And I'd get Manglow Rage.

01:38:20.600 --> 01:38:26.200
Yeah, you'd have to get like, raging tight shorts or something.

01:38:26.200 --> 01:38:28.440
The results screen is a, and I quote,

01:38:28.440 --> 01:38:31.520
bubbly bubble bubbly bub in the background, and not fancy,

01:38:31.520 --> 01:38:32.520
just plain and simple.

01:38:32.520 --> 01:38:34.640
However, it shows how many calories you've burned.

01:38:34.640 --> 01:38:36.680
Doesn't look like workout mode because the numerical score

01:38:36.680 --> 01:38:37.320
has shown.

01:38:37.320 --> 01:38:39.560
I didn't even notice that when I was playing.

01:38:39.560 --> 01:38:41.320
And I've been saying for like two years now

01:38:41.320 --> 01:38:44.340
that they just need to integrate workout mode into the normal DDR.

01:38:44.340 --> 01:38:46.440
So if that actually happened, that makes me very happy.

01:38:46.440 --> 01:38:48.000
I didn't even notice that when I was playing,

01:38:48.000 --> 01:38:50.200
but I was just so jazzed to be playing UltraMix III,

01:38:50.200 --> 01:38:53.960
wasn't looking for all the little things and I was playing it but that's very

01:38:53.960 --> 01:38:56.800
cool because I don't think workout mode should be separate because you can't

01:38:56.800 --> 01:39:01.000
unlock things when you play in workout mode at least I don't think you can but

01:39:01.000 --> 01:39:04.720
from what I remember about Ultramix 3 and the interface basically take

01:39:04.720 --> 01:39:09.320
Ultramix 2 and replace whatever blue futuristic background thing they had

01:39:09.320 --> 01:39:18.200
with the bubbles and that was Ultramix 3's interface the main part of it so so

01:39:18.200 --> 01:39:22.600
If you want to see that, that's over on DDRFreak, and I will get my pictures up at some point.

01:39:22.600 --> 01:39:26.520
I don't think my pictures show anything new about the game, but I guess you never know.

01:39:26.520 --> 01:39:29.480
But you do have a picture of me with Mario.

01:39:29.480 --> 01:39:31.440
I do have a picture of you with Mario, and it rocks.

01:39:31.440 --> 01:39:33.320
I have a picture of me with Mario, and one with Link.

01:39:33.320 --> 01:39:36.640
I took some pictures of the BeatMania demo too, but the BeatMania demo really didn't

01:39:36.640 --> 01:39:37.640
have anything in it.

01:39:37.640 --> 01:39:41.260
I mean, the BeatMania demo was just night style, plus, oh my god, it's five key songs

01:39:41.260 --> 01:39:42.260
in it.

01:39:42.260 --> 01:39:43.260
Woohoo!

01:39:43.260 --> 01:39:47.260
Oh, and it was stuck on training...

01:39:47.260 --> 01:39:51.260
What the hell is the one star mode called? I can't even remember.

01:39:51.260 --> 01:39:55.260
Yeah, beginner mode. Seven key mode was stuck on beginner mode, which I thought was kind of funny.

01:39:55.260 --> 01:39:59.260
But it's not going to be that way in the regular release, so don't worry guys.

01:39:59.260 --> 01:40:03.260
Any day now we should start

01:40:03.260 --> 01:40:07.260
finding out new songs for these games. I'm surprised no new artists have leaked out what songs

01:40:07.260 --> 01:40:11.260
are going to be in it or anything like that. So, one of these days... Not yet!

01:40:11.260 --> 01:40:13.980
start finding out some songs pretty soon. I would hope that they're going to put out

01:40:13.980 --> 01:40:19.460
a finalized release pretty soon. Well, before that, don't you think, when the press gets

01:40:19.460 --> 01:40:23.780
a hold of these games, they're going to start posting pictures on their website? Has GamePro

01:40:23.780 --> 01:40:29.860
reviewed it again yet? Not yet, but you know it'll happen. I swear, does it not mean, like,

01:40:29.860 --> 01:40:38.540
not learn with GamePro? I would seriously try to sue them for, you know. But, well,

01:40:38.540 --> 01:40:43.540
Well, no, because it created buzz for their games. I think it had a positive effect.

01:40:43.540 --> 01:40:48.540
It created buzz on the games and got people talking, oh my god, here's the song list, oh my god, oh my god.

01:40:48.540 --> 01:40:53.540
So, you know, I don't think it was a bad thing. I wouldn't sue them over it. It got people talking about the game, free advertising.

01:40:53.540 --> 01:40:58.540
Where I'd make them review the Ninja Turtles game over and over and over again. Or Frogger.

01:40:58.540 --> 01:41:05.380
All right, kids, I think it's time to get into tonight's cage match.

01:41:05.380 --> 01:41:11.540
If you want to be a part of the cage match, you've got to join our chat room over at www.orangeloungeradio.com.

01:41:11.540 --> 01:41:22.140
All right, and the way the cage match works, we're going to play three songs for you guys.

01:41:22.140 --> 01:41:25.620
Last week's winner, a clip of it anyway, because it won last week, so you've already heard

01:41:25.620 --> 01:41:26.620
the song.

01:41:26.620 --> 01:41:30.500
play that and we're going to play two new songs for you guys. You guys vote on your

01:41:30.500 --> 01:41:36.100
favorite and the winner goes into rotation all week long on Orange Lounge Radio's Bimani

01:41:36.100 --> 01:41:40.180
Music and More program which plays 24 hours a day, 7 days a week on the station when we

01:41:40.180 --> 01:41:46.860
are not live. Alright, here it is. Last week in the KH match, an old song, I guess an older

01:41:46.860 --> 01:41:52.340
song, a song that was made in the early 90s, took it, but I guess it was discovered that

01:41:52.340 --> 01:42:02.760
our chat room likes a little retro now and then. Blur won it and the song is called Girls

01:42:02.760 --> 01:42:07.620
and Boys. Will it win for a second week? I've noticed people have been in a retro mood all

01:42:07.620 --> 01:42:12.820
night so it just might win. Here's a clip of song number one you can vote for tonight,

01:42:12.820 --> 01:42:19.820
blur with girls and boys.

01:42:42.820 --> 01:42:48.820
Someone to wait for, five fingers, nothing is wasted

01:42:48.820 --> 01:42:52.820
Only we produce

01:42:52.820 --> 01:42:56.820
You cannot be blisters

01:42:56.820 --> 01:42:58.820
You've been session

01:42:58.820 --> 01:43:01.820
But we have to think and try to

01:43:01.820 --> 01:43:03.820
Girls who are boys, who like boys

01:43:03.820 --> 01:43:05.820
Could be girls, could be boys

01:43:05.820 --> 01:43:09.820
I think girls, could be girls, but they're boys

01:43:09.820 --> 01:43:17.820
Always should be someone you really love

01:43:17.820 --> 01:43:25.820
Girls love boys, love boys, big girls, boys love their girls, girls love their boys

01:43:25.820 --> 01:43:33.820
I should be someone to really love

01:43:33.820 --> 01:43:57.820
Looking for girls who are boys, who like boys, who be girls, who do boys like their girls, who do girls like their boys

01:43:57.820 --> 01:44:05.820
Always should be someone you really love

01:44:05.820 --> 01:44:13.820
Girls who are boys who like boys who be girls who do boys like their girls who do girls like their boys

01:44:13.820 --> 01:44:21.820
Always should be someone you really love

01:44:21.820 --> 01:44:26.380
Girls who are boys will like boys, rotten free girls, rotten free boys

01:44:26.380 --> 01:44:37.840
But girls who are boys will always should be someone you really like

01:44:37.840 --> 01:44:42.240
Girls who are boys will like boys, rotten free girls, rotten free boys

01:44:42.240 --> 01:44:45.680
But girls who are boys will always should be someone you really like

01:44:45.680 --> 01:44:54.680
I wish I could be someone to be loved

01:45:15.680 --> 01:45:23.040
beer. Whoopee! Alright, anyway, we're going to get into song number two tonight's Cage

01:45:23.040 --> 01:45:27.080
Mess, so that was song number one, Blur with Girls and Boys. Here's song number two. Song

01:45:27.080 --> 01:45:35.500
number two tonight is my pick, and I decided to pick, I kind of like the new Utada album,

01:45:35.500 --> 01:45:40.880
so I picked a song that's actually a remix, because I like this remix because it's different

01:45:40.880 --> 01:45:45.000
than the song on the album and I think it's a little bit better so and I was

01:45:45.000 --> 01:45:47.840
also just desperate to find something at the last minute so I just went ahead and

01:45:47.840 --> 01:45:50.760
picked this one so here it is song number two tonight's cage match it's

01:45:50.760 --> 01:45:57.760
Jutada with Exodus 04, the Double J radio mix.

01:46:20.760 --> 01:46:39.200
With you, these streets are heaven Now home feels so foreign

01:46:39.200 --> 01:46:46.440
They told me I was mistaken, infatuated And I was afraid to trust my conscience

01:46:46.440 --> 01:46:48.440
Now I am ready

01:46:48.440 --> 01:46:50.440
Daddy, don't be mad, I'm leaving

01:46:50.440 --> 01:46:52.440
Please let me worry about me

01:46:52.440 --> 01:46:54.440
Mama, don't you worry about me

01:46:54.440 --> 01:46:56.440
This is my story

01:46:56.440 --> 01:46:58.440
Do you love when you die and dance up

01:46:58.440 --> 01:47:00.440
The ocean through the desert sky

01:47:00.440 --> 01:47:02.440
Say goodbye to the best we know

01:47:02.440 --> 01:47:04.440
This is our exodus, this is our exodus

01:47:04.440 --> 01:47:06.440
From the tragic chat to Tokyo

01:47:06.440 --> 01:47:08.440
New music on the radio

01:47:08.440 --> 01:47:10.440
Say goodbye to the worst we know

01:47:10.440 --> 01:47:13.080
Help me up, this is our exodus, this is our exodus

01:47:30.080 --> 01:47:33.880
Landscapes keep changing

01:47:33.880 --> 01:47:37.680
History teaches something

01:47:37.680 --> 01:47:40.480
I know I could be mistaken, but my heart is broken

01:47:40.480 --> 01:47:44.800
I cannot redirect my feelings

01:47:44.800 --> 01:47:47.080
The ways that part it

01:47:47.080 --> 01:47:49.080
Daddy told me there's no meaning

01:47:49.080 --> 01:47:51.080
Please don't be worried about me

01:47:51.080 --> 01:47:53.280
Mama, don't you worry about me

01:47:53.280 --> 01:47:54.880
This is my story

01:47:54.880 --> 01:47:56.880
Through the mountainside and valley slope

01:47:56.880 --> 01:47:59.080
The ocean through the desert sky

01:47:59.080 --> 01:48:01.080
We'll take a ride to the best we know

01:48:01.080 --> 01:48:03.080
This is the rest of, this is the rest of

01:48:03.080 --> 01:48:05.080
Through the traffic jams in Tokyo

01:48:05.080 --> 01:48:07.280
New music on the radio

01:48:07.280 --> 01:48:09.280
When you say goodbye to the world we know

01:48:09.280 --> 01:48:11.280
This is our exit, this is our exit

01:48:28.280 --> 01:48:32.280
I live to hear my music never ending

01:48:32.280 --> 01:48:34.280
My baby

01:48:34.280 --> 01:48:36.280
Don't you know I'll never let you down

01:48:36.280 --> 01:48:40.580
You've spoken me to so many different endings

01:48:40.580 --> 01:48:44.780
But baby, I know that you'll always be around

01:48:44.780 --> 01:48:46.740
To mountainside and valleys, yo

01:48:46.740 --> 01:48:49.120
The ocean blues and desert sky

01:48:49.120 --> 01:48:50.880
You make a fire to the fence, yo

01:48:50.880 --> 01:48:53.060
This is your exit, this is your exit

01:48:53.060 --> 01:48:54.840
To the tragic challenge, yo

01:48:54.840 --> 01:48:57.480
You music on radio

01:48:57.480 --> 01:49:02.040
You make a fire to the Kurt L

01:49:02.040 --> 01:49:03.660
To mountainside and valleys, yo

01:49:03.660 --> 01:49:05.500
The ocean blues and desert sky

01:49:05.500 --> 01:49:09.500
Yeah, say good-bye to the friends we know This is our exodus, this is our exodus

01:49:09.500 --> 01:49:13.500
We're gonna try to challenge you, key up, hear the music on the radio

01:49:13.500 --> 01:49:18.500
You made me fly to the moon But you're still there, it's too late, it's too late

01:49:43.500 --> 01:49:54.100
Song number 2 in tonight's stage match, that was Utada with Exodus 04. It smells like beer

01:49:54.100 --> 01:50:00.040
in here. I wonder why. Let's see if that song should go on in Exodus or if it should stay

01:50:00.040 --> 01:50:06.720
here forever. Dark Sakura. Kind of generic and sounds like all the rest of her stuff,

01:50:06.720 --> 01:50:13.480
so it gets a fix. Loki. I like the instrumental, but the vocals just sounded like, nah, I don't

01:50:13.480 --> 01:50:15.180
I guess it just sounds like her, so...

01:50:15.180 --> 01:50:17.240
Um, it was okay. It was just...

01:50:17.240 --> 01:50:18.560
Like, eight.

01:50:18.560 --> 01:50:22.740
I agree on that it's a little repetitive, but it is, you know, it's kind of a dance mix, so...

01:50:22.740 --> 01:50:24.000
But, um...

01:50:24.000 --> 01:50:26.720
I think it improves on the original side. I don't like the original.

01:50:26.720 --> 01:50:28.080
It's like a low-energy dance mix.

01:50:28.080 --> 01:50:32.520
Yeah, it's kind of a closing time dance mix.

01:50:32.520 --> 01:50:37.640
I'm standing there drunk, and I'm kind of, like, bobbing my head to the music, you know?

01:50:37.640 --> 01:50:40.280
All right, so I give it, like, an eight.

01:50:40.280 --> 01:50:43.280
Song number three, Loki's pick. What did you pick for us tonight, Loki?

01:50:43.280 --> 01:50:46.280
Well, if you want retro, here's retro right here. Sort of.

01:50:46.280 --> 01:50:50.280
It's retro redone. It's, um, Stayin' Alive, originally by the-

01:50:50.280 --> 01:50:51.280
Like the Bee Gees?

01:50:51.280 --> 01:50:54.280
Like the Bee Gees, but done by Ozzy Osbourne.

01:50:56.280 --> 01:50:57.280
Okay.

01:50:57.280 --> 01:50:58.280
It's good.

01:50:59.280 --> 01:51:00.280
What? Wait.

01:51:00.280 --> 01:51:01.280
Stayin' Alive.

01:51:01.280 --> 01:51:03.280
Oh, I, I, I have this.

01:51:03.280 --> 01:51:04.280
Okay, here we go.

01:51:04.280 --> 01:51:05.280
I already know what I'm reading it.

01:51:05.280 --> 01:51:09.320
Alright here we go song number three staying alive by Ozzy Osbourne enjoy

01:51:35.280 --> 01:51:48.280
Well you can't tell by the way I used to walk I'm a woman's man, sometimes you don't

01:51:48.280 --> 01:51:53.280
And you can't tell by the way I walk I've been kicked around since I was born

01:51:53.280 --> 01:52:00.280
It's alright, it's okay, you raise up in the other way But we can try to understand

01:52:00.280 --> 01:52:02.280
No such effect on man

01:52:02.280 --> 01:52:06.780
But the devil has no way of knowing what you're gonna say in a lie, say in a lie

01:52:06.780 --> 01:52:09.280
I never think of thinking any other woman should be there

01:52:09.280 --> 01:52:11.280
Say in a lie, say in a lie

01:52:11.280 --> 01:52:14.280
Ha ha ha ha ha

01:52:14.280 --> 01:52:16.280
Say in a lie, say in a lie

01:52:16.280 --> 01:52:18.280
Ha ha ha ha ha

01:52:18.280 --> 01:52:23.280
Say in a lie

01:52:23.280 --> 01:52:32.280
Everybody wants to dance, oh darling, we're going to dance with the devil

01:52:32.280 --> 01:52:37.280
Well I get low, well I get high, if a gang can eat up I really try

01:52:37.280 --> 01:52:42.280
Just the way some heaven's on my shoes, I'm a dancing man and I just can't breathe

01:52:42.280 --> 01:52:46.280
Now we know the light, it's okay, our lips are seein' us again

01:52:46.280 --> 01:52:51.280
We can't find, we want to stand, cause we all got your back on their head

01:53:21.280 --> 01:53:26.280
It's alright, it's okay But you better go the other way

01:53:26.280 --> 01:53:31.280
We can't fight, understand But you don't try to make us win

01:53:36.280 --> 01:53:40.280
It's alright, it's okay But it's still not the game

01:53:40.280 --> 01:53:45.280
We can't fight for something, there's no time to think of it

01:55:10.280 --> 01:55:20.280
I have become mad

01:55:20.280 --> 01:55:25.280
Oh yeah

01:55:25.280 --> 01:55:30.280
Alright now

01:55:30.280 --> 01:55:58.720
Now my ass smells like beer because I sat in the wet beer part of the chair.

01:55:58.720 --> 01:56:01.720
I'm sorry song number three Ozzy Osbourne staying alive

01:56:03.040 --> 01:56:08.400
What do you think staying alive, or should we pull the plug on that song Dark Sakura staying alive was a crap movie

01:56:10.440 --> 01:56:16.440
I've had this that particular song for quite a while now, and I've listened to it quite a lot

01:56:16.440 --> 01:56:23.480
And I think it's a wonderful cover. It's fun, but I don't think it's cage-matchy, so it gets me seven and a half

01:56:23.480 --> 01:56:31.920
It was all I got in five minutes, so it gets an eight.

01:56:31.920 --> 01:56:35.560
My synopsis, somewhere the disco train derailed.

01:56:35.560 --> 01:56:37.200
I give it a five.

01:56:37.200 --> 01:56:41.560
It was the crazy train up at the disco train.

01:56:41.560 --> 01:56:45.760
Alright boys and girls, we're going to recap the three songs and then you get to place

01:56:45.760 --> 01:56:46.760
your votes.

01:56:46.760 --> 01:57:00.620
Number one you can vote for tonight is Girls and Boys.

01:57:00.620 --> 01:57:09.580
And song number two you can vote for tonight is Exodus 04 by Utada.

01:57:09.580 --> 01:57:14.060
And song number three you can vote for tonight is Ozzy Osbourne with Stayin' Alive.

01:57:14.060 --> 01:57:16.060
It just cracks me up to say.

01:57:16.060 --> 01:57:17.540
Put me in the middle of the world.

01:57:17.540 --> 01:57:19.540
So you're the one that's gonna stand in the light.

01:57:19.540 --> 01:57:20.540
Stand in the light.

01:57:20.540 --> 01:57:23.460
Please vote now.

01:57:23.460 --> 01:57:26.140
Send a private message to Sky in the chat room

01:57:26.140 --> 01:57:30.220
with your vote for song number one, the Blur, song number two,

01:57:30.220 --> 01:57:33.060
the Utada, or song number three, the Aussie.

01:57:33.060 --> 01:57:33.680
I don't know.

01:57:33.680 --> 01:57:35.100
I think Stand Alive would be cool

01:57:35.100 --> 01:57:37.300
if it was in Guitar Freaks.

01:57:37.300 --> 01:57:38.740
Now, that would be cool.

01:57:38.740 --> 01:57:40.300
Well, the Guitar Hero's coming out.

01:57:40.300 --> 01:57:42.060
And it's supposed to have a lot of covers.

01:57:42.060 --> 01:57:45.060
It's going to have Bowie in it, which is cool, and it's going to Hendrix.

01:57:45.060 --> 01:57:46.060
I think Bowie needs a guitar.

01:57:46.060 --> 01:57:49.020
It's going to be the total stoner game.

01:57:49.020 --> 01:57:51.140
Guitar Freaks need something different.

01:57:51.140 --> 01:57:55.100
They really, I'm very disappointed that they got rid of Keyboard Mania.

01:57:55.100 --> 01:57:56.100
Me too.

01:57:56.100 --> 01:57:59.580
I mean, that was kind of, they should have been, instead of getting rid of games that

01:57:59.580 --> 01:58:03.740
plug with Guitar Freaks, they should have added stuff to it.

01:58:03.740 --> 01:58:07.460
Like maybe a karaoke game to go with it, you know, and you could sing the vocals of the

01:58:07.460 --> 01:58:11.580
the songs or maybe, I don't know, another instrument or something that they could be

01:58:11.580 --> 01:58:12.580
playing?

01:58:12.580 --> 01:58:16.920
Yeah, I know. I know. Keyboard Mania. The reason why I'm pissed off that Konami got

01:58:16.920 --> 01:58:19.620
rid of Keyboard Mania is because Keyboard Mania was a one-by-many game that I was actually

01:58:19.620 --> 01:58:23.300
pretty good at, that a lot of people don't take the time to be good at. And so I got

01:58:23.300 --> 01:58:27.300
really good at Keyboard Mania, and it was, like, I wasn't blue good, but I was good.

01:58:27.300 --> 01:58:32.140
I can actually pass songs on doubles, which I think is good. And I can pass, like, six,

01:58:32.140 --> 01:58:35.180
like, I can pass, like, you know, most of the six stars. I mean, the only one I could

01:58:35.180 --> 01:58:39.580
Never Pass was the crazy one from, I don't even remember the name of it, it's been so

01:58:39.580 --> 01:58:40.580
long since I've played.

01:58:40.580 --> 01:58:43.820
But it pissed me off because I was like, you know, I could have, I could have been really

01:58:43.820 --> 01:58:44.820
good.

01:58:44.820 --> 01:58:47.260
I could have been a contender at Keyboard Mania and they went and pulled the plug on

01:58:47.260 --> 01:58:48.260
my game.

01:58:48.260 --> 01:58:49.260
Bastards.

01:58:49.260 --> 01:58:50.260
Sucks.

01:58:50.260 --> 01:58:52.220
Anyway, this is usually the part of the show where I ask Loki, what is going on in the

01:58:52.220 --> 01:58:53.220
sim world?

01:58:53.220 --> 01:58:54.220
Loki, what's going on?

01:58:54.220 --> 01:58:55.220
Not too much.

01:58:55.220 --> 01:59:01.900
Really, the only thing mentioned, or worth mentioning, would be DROSC Psychopath Edition

01:59:01.900 --> 01:59:04.780
is in the judging stage now.

01:59:04.780 --> 01:59:11.380
have a wonderful song list of eight different songs because most of the entries dropped

01:59:11.380 --> 01:59:18.340
out. So, yeah, eight songs. The theme of this mix was basically, or this contest was basically

01:59:18.340 --> 01:59:23.980
like... Dude, I got eighth place in the Simphile competition. I rock. No, it's basically funny

01:59:23.980 --> 01:59:30.820
songs. That was the point. So they picked funny songs, did step files for them and right

01:59:30.820 --> 01:59:40.820
Okay, now basically you can go download them. It's on the front page of MyStyle, and there's reviews and discussion. So go check them out, I guess.

01:59:40.820 --> 01:59:46.820
And I'm sure there's another tourney mix coming, and we don't care.

01:59:46.820 --> 01:59:48.820
What number tourney mix is this?

01:59:48.820 --> 01:59:51.820
I think that'd be six.

01:59:51.820 --> 01:59:53.820
What happened to tourney mix five?

01:59:53.820 --> 01:59:58.820
No, five happened. I thought five happened.

01:59:58.820 --> 02:00:00.820
I don't follow that stuff anymore, because I...

02:00:00.820 --> 02:00:02.820
Maybe five didn't happen. Maybe it was four I'm thinking of.

02:00:02.820 --> 02:00:05.820
Anyways, so five, Turning Mix 5 is supposed to happen.

02:00:05.820 --> 02:00:09.820
The rules are going to get more retarded, and honestly, it's...

02:00:09.820 --> 02:00:11.820
Are they going to remove the names of the people who made the...

02:00:11.820 --> 02:00:14.820
No! No! No, no, the one intelligent...

02:00:14.820 --> 02:00:16.820
We've been saying this for years.

02:00:16.820 --> 02:00:21.820
The way to make Turning Mix fair is to remove the names of the people who made the step files until the end.

02:00:21.820 --> 02:00:22.820
But...

02:00:22.820 --> 02:00:27.820
That's the way to do it. That's the only way you can judge fairly, instead of making it, you know, uh...

02:00:27.820 --> 02:00:37.820
It's just a popularity contest, but nope. They're not going to do that because they're retarded, so whatever. I don't care.

02:00:37.820 --> 02:00:49.820
And nothing else going on as far as the Japanese mix type things. No one's really making any progress, so who knows.

02:00:49.820 --> 02:00:53.820
Everyone's busy playing games or something.

02:00:53.820 --> 02:00:54.820
Alright.

02:00:54.820 --> 02:00:59.820
So we go to a call. We're getting a call on the Skype line even though I had it turned off, but why not, huh?

02:00:59.820 --> 02:01:00.820
Sure.

02:01:00.820 --> 02:01:01.820
Alright, why not. We'll pick up this call.

02:01:03.820 --> 02:01:04.820
Hi, you're on Orange Lawn's radio.

02:01:06.820 --> 02:01:07.820
Hello?

02:01:09.820 --> 02:01:14.820
Um, hi. Um, TM came...Turnimix 5 came out a while ago. I think it was last year.

02:01:15.820 --> 02:01:18.820
You can see how much...you know what, honestly, I have to admit, I kind of, um...

02:01:18.820 --> 02:01:27.820
I kind of got off the Tournamix train a while ago just because it was kind of getting, to me, in my opinion, it was getting way overrated.

02:01:27.820 --> 02:01:33.820
Like people were taking Tournamix way too seriously and taking the people that were successful in Tournamix way too seriously.

02:01:33.820 --> 02:01:39.820
And there would be good stuff that would be put in Tournamix that nobody would download because they didn't know the person who did it.

02:01:39.820 --> 02:01:42.820
So I was like, you know what, I'm done.

02:01:42.820 --> 02:01:47.820
I don't pay any attention to forum drama, I just download the actual songs and everything and delete the ones I don't like.

02:01:47.820 --> 02:01:50.960
And that's okay, and that's the good things about these competitions, that at least it

02:01:50.960 --> 02:01:55.440
gives you tons of new step files for your step mania.

02:01:55.440 --> 02:01:58.900
And I'll tell you what, one other good thing about it is that I actually pick up usually

02:01:58.900 --> 02:02:02.940
a couple new good songs that I like that I wouldn't have thought to download before.

02:02:02.940 --> 02:02:06.140
Because there's a couple people out there that have similar tastes to music than I do.

02:02:06.140 --> 02:02:07.140
Who would have thought?

02:02:07.140 --> 02:02:09.660
And so sometimes I find good new music through Turnamix.

02:02:09.660 --> 02:02:13.060
So for that, I support it, but that's about it.

02:02:13.060 --> 02:02:18.060
Yeah, I mean I don't even know who won any of them because I just don't pay attention.

02:02:18.060 --> 02:02:23.060
You know, it's just, I don't care who wins, I just care about what's there.

02:02:23.060 --> 02:02:25.060
Do you ever enter these things?

02:02:25.060 --> 02:02:26.060
What?

02:02:26.060 --> 02:02:27.060
Do you ever enter the competitions?

02:02:27.060 --> 02:02:31.060
Oh no, I don't make any Symphiles because I'm not very good.

02:02:31.060 --> 02:02:35.060
You know what my problem with making Symphiles is, is that I make heavy steps and then like

02:02:35.060 --> 02:02:40.060
I don't have the time or effort to make standard or light steps.

02:02:40.060 --> 02:02:42.060
Nobody's paying me to do it so I don't have any incentive.

02:02:42.060 --> 02:02:48.060
And then my art skills are ass-tastic. Like, I cannot draw backgrounds for crap.

02:02:48.060 --> 02:02:56.060
And so, and honestly, it's kind of sad, but like, if you have a good background, it'll make your step file, like, ten times better in some people's opinions.

02:02:56.060 --> 02:02:58.060
So, for that reason, I don't do step files.

02:02:58.060 --> 02:03:01.060
Um, was I supposed to identify myself?

02:03:01.060 --> 02:03:03.060
Yeah. What's your name?

02:03:03.060 --> 02:03:05.060
Um, Game Boy Guy 13.

02:03:05.060 --> 02:03:10.060
Hello, Game Boy Guy 13. Are you also DS Guy 13, or are you just strictly Game Boy?

02:03:10.060 --> 02:03:14.060
I don't have a DS because I don't have money.

02:03:14.060 --> 02:03:19.060
That's a reason that stops a lot of us from getting a DS, so I sympathize with you there.

02:03:19.060 --> 02:03:22.060
I don't even have an SP. I want one, but don't have one.

02:03:22.060 --> 02:03:26.060
Oh, no. So you're playing on an old-style advance?

02:03:26.060 --> 02:03:28.060
Yeah, just an advance.

02:03:28.060 --> 02:03:30.060
Do you have a backline on it?

02:03:30.060 --> 02:03:32.060
No, it's an advance.

02:03:32.060 --> 02:03:36.060
Well, yeah, but you can get those things modded, put afterburners in them.

02:03:36.060 --> 02:03:42.060
You poor guy. My God. The first wave of Game Boy Advances were bad.

02:03:42.060 --> 02:03:45.060
I mean, for that reason. It needed a backlight so bad.

02:03:45.060 --> 02:03:48.060
But you were a brave man for putting up with it this whole time.

02:03:48.060 --> 02:03:53.060
What's really funny is I went in a used game store and found a really old Game Boy for like five bucks.

02:03:53.060 --> 02:03:56.060
I considered buying it but decided not to.

02:03:56.060 --> 02:03:58.060
One of the old Paperweight Game Boys?

02:03:58.060 --> 02:04:00.060
Yeah.

02:04:00.060 --> 02:04:05.060
I would buy a Virtual Boy for five dollars.

02:04:05.060 --> 02:04:07.060
Just so I can give my friends headaches.

02:04:07.060 --> 02:04:10.060
Come here, play this cool new game I got.

02:04:10.060 --> 02:04:11.060
Hey, I have one.

02:04:11.060 --> 02:04:12.060
Do you really?

02:04:12.060 --> 02:04:13.060
I thought you knew.

02:04:13.060 --> 02:04:17.060
Well, you have every system under the sun, so it really shouldn't be a surprise.

02:04:17.060 --> 02:04:22.060
We need to do a show at your house eventually and whip out all the old game systems and play them on air.

02:04:22.060 --> 02:04:25.060
I am not going to play the Virtual Boy.

02:04:25.060 --> 02:04:27.060
I will drink and play Virtual Boy on air.

02:04:27.060 --> 02:04:32.060
I can't play that for more than five minutes without getting a raging headache that makes me have to pass out.

02:04:32.060 --> 02:04:34.060
What games do you have?

02:04:34.060 --> 02:04:37.060
Oh, hell if I know. I don't touch the damn thing.

02:04:37.060 --> 02:04:40.060
Do you have the Mario crash or whatever it was?

02:04:40.060 --> 02:04:45.060
Yeah, and tennis and something else. I remember those stupid commercials.

02:04:45.060 --> 02:04:49.060
By the way, yes, look. I forgot to mention.

02:04:49.060 --> 02:04:52.060
Tourney Mix 6 is actually going on right now.

02:04:52.060 --> 02:04:58.060
And they call it Tourney Mix Final because thank God they're not doing it anymore.

02:04:58.060 --> 02:05:03.060
Basically, it says the deadline for registration is July 25th.

02:05:03.060 --> 02:05:04.980
Your file submission is the 29th.

02:05:04.980 --> 02:05:08.300
Your basic rules format here.

02:05:08.300 --> 02:05:09.900
Let's see here.

02:05:09.900 --> 02:05:12.780
Score breakdown and info.

02:05:12.780 --> 02:05:13.540
Let's see what we've got here.

02:05:13.540 --> 02:05:15.580
Come on, load.

02:05:15.580 --> 02:05:18.340
Anyways, DDR East Coast Invasion, which is a site that

02:05:18.340 --> 02:05:22.820
I haven't been to in a long time.

02:05:22.820 --> 02:05:24.860
Wow, and it's working so well, too.

02:05:24.860 --> 02:05:29.220
Anyways, the info, you can find it there.

02:05:29.220 --> 02:05:30.180
Yeah, OK, we get it.

02:05:30.180 --> 02:05:31.900
It's Turned X. It hasn't changed.

02:05:31.900 --> 02:05:34.380
Anyway, anything else you want to share with us, Game Boy Guy?

02:05:34.380 --> 02:05:35.380
Oh, oh.

02:05:35.380 --> 02:05:36.380
Not really.

02:05:36.380 --> 02:05:37.380
Okay then, Game Boy Guy.

02:05:37.380 --> 02:05:38.380
I'm going to say goodbye.

02:05:38.380 --> 02:05:39.380
But thank you for calling in.

02:05:39.380 --> 02:05:40.380
Have a great night.

02:05:40.380 --> 02:05:41.380
Uh-huh.

02:05:41.380 --> 02:05:42.380
You, too.

02:05:42.380 --> 02:05:43.380
Later.

02:05:43.380 --> 02:05:44.380
Get this.

02:05:44.380 --> 02:05:46.540
Here's the song restrictions and time length restrictions.

02:05:46.540 --> 02:05:50.500

You may use songs from other rhythm and game music or rhythm and game music games.

02:06:02.840 --> 02:06:03.840
Hooray!

02:06:03.840 --> 02:06:04.840
More 2DX whores.

02:06:04.840 --> 02:06:05.840
No, no, no, no.

02:06:05.840 --> 02:06:07.960
You get penalties for using games for 2DX.

02:06:07.960 --> 02:06:14.040
You get a minus 10 points penalty, pop music, minus 10, beat mania, minus 3, para para,

02:06:14.040 --> 02:06:22.200
minus 2, Marshall Beats, minus 2, what's that, Parappa the Rapper, minus 2, Unjammy Lemmy,

02:06:41.360 --> 02:06:47.000
like I don't know before you max plus 0 great is zero what's the point basically

02:06:47.000 --> 02:06:53.000
Basically, they're talking about how good the remixes are. So, yeah, whatever.

02:06:53.000 --> 02:06:54.000
Whatever.

02:06:54.000 --> 02:07:00.400
If it's over two minutes, 40 seconds, you get five-point deduction and it keeps going

02:07:00.400 --> 02:07:07.560
up from there. It's just like, basically, they score you on background animations, one

02:07:07.560 --> 02:07:12.920
point, movies, one point, challenge steps, one point. These are additional to what you're

02:07:12.920 --> 02:07:13.700
you're doing.

02:07:13.700 --> 02:07:15.540
Beginning steps, you get another point.

02:07:15.540 --> 02:07:17.300
In double steps, you get one to four points.

02:07:17.300 --> 02:07:21.020
Lyrics, one to four points.

02:07:21.020 --> 02:07:23.980
Breakdowns, it says all entries are counted and checked

02:07:23.980 --> 02:07:26.580
for correct file formatting.

02:07:26.580 --> 02:07:29.340
Entries are then randomly sorted in the brackets.

02:07:29.340 --> 02:07:31.860
Each week, a bracket will be released to the public.

02:07:31.860 --> 02:07:35.740
And it says, public will have no say in the first round.

02:07:35.740 --> 02:07:38.220
Public sway has been removed.

02:07:38.220 --> 02:07:39.740
Good.

02:07:39.740 --> 02:07:40.420
Let's see here.

02:07:40.420 --> 02:07:46.740
Number of judges or the numbers judges will be working on 10 points for light 25 for standard 50 for heavy

02:07:47.300 --> 02:07:53.160
5 points for appropriate danceable step file 5 points for readme 5 points for background and banner

02:07:54.620 --> 02:07:57.460
See if you get 80 points it grants you to the next round

02:07:58.260 --> 02:08:00.180
total of a hundred

02:08:00.180 --> 02:08:03.420
extra entries plus 5 penalties minus 35

02:08:04.140 --> 02:08:06.420
Yeah, I know. It's basically I'm just

02:08:06.420 --> 02:08:22.420
Anyways, I'm just trying to see if they had the actual, you know, whether or not the people's names would be displayed, but it does not say, so I'm going to have to assume that's a yes.

02:08:22.420 --> 02:08:28.420
If you're really interested, it's ddrei.com. Have fun. It's the last one. Thank God.

02:08:28.420 --> 02:08:31.420
Alright. You guys want to hear who won tonight's cage match?

02:08:31.420 --> 02:08:32.420
I guess.

02:08:32.420 --> 02:08:39.420
Yes. Alright. Tonight was a landslide victory, by the way. We haven't had one of these in a while. We've had a lot of ties lately, but tonight was a freaking landslide.

02:08:39.420 --> 02:08:43.420
Yeah. Yep, it sure was. So here it is, tonight's winner, boys and girls.

02:08:45.420 --> 02:08:52.420
Ozzy Osbourne. Staying alive, sheep, all of you.

02:08:52.420 --> 02:09:06.460
Alright, let's take a break. We're going to take a break when we come back. We'll get

02:09:06.460 --> 02:09:10.100
into the FUs of the week, most definitely. Also, somebody else wants to give us a call

02:09:10.100 --> 02:09:14.520
via Skype, talk about Happy Sky a little bit, and whatever else we can dig out of our butts

02:09:14.520 --> 02:09:19.420
when we come back from this break. Lots of poo. Let's start off with this. Some poor

02:09:19.420 --> 02:09:22.680
person in the chatroom has been begging me to play this song all night long, so here

02:09:22.680 --> 02:09:26.260
it is. We're gonna start it out with a song called 12th Style, which is what the game

02:09:26.260 --> 02:09:31.600
should be called, dammit. So here it is, 12th Style. We'll be back with more. Happy Orange

02:09:31.600 --> 02:09:38.600
Here's Lon's radio after this.

02:11:31.600 --> 02:11:39.600
loki, what did you think of that song?

02:11:39.600 --> 02:11:41.600
i thought it was lame

02:11:41.600 --> 02:11:48.600
here's some akira yamoka then

02:13:11.600 --> 02:13:14.600
I don't know

02:13:41.600 --> 02:13:43.600
You

02:15:11.600 --> 02:15:40.760
Have you

02:15:40.760 --> 02:15:44.760
Have you ever walked into Radio Shack and hit the demo button on all the keyboards?

02:15:44.760 --> 02:15:49.760
So that you have like 60 keyboard demos all playing over the top of each other all at once?

02:15:49.760 --> 02:15:50.760
That sounded like yuck.

02:15:50.760 --> 02:15:52.760
That's what that sounded like to me.

02:15:52.760 --> 02:15:54.760
Honestly, that sounded like me playing the keyboard.

02:15:54.760 --> 02:15:57.760
And I can't play the keyboard, so that's what it would sound like.

02:15:57.760 --> 02:16:00.760
That was just a bunch of random notes and beats.

02:16:00.760 --> 02:16:03.760
It just had nothing to, it was not even a song.

02:16:03.760 --> 02:16:04.760
Needs more cowbell.

02:16:04.760 --> 02:16:05.760
Exactly.

02:16:05.760 --> 02:16:07.760
Needs less suckiness.

02:16:07.760 --> 02:16:11.960
sucking it though where they have them keep their all i had my flight at my cat

02:16:11.960 --> 02:16:16.280
walk across the keyboard one more time ago please good girl here it is good

02:16:16.280 --> 02:16:17.120
Good, cool.

02:17:16.280 --> 02:17:23.280
I know it's hard to really know someone It's just a long time to trust someone

02:17:23.280 --> 02:17:29.280
But I don't care how long it will take My love is up so much

02:17:29.280 --> 02:17:37.280
So, baby, baby, let me show you The very finest thing that I hide, yeah

02:17:37.280 --> 02:17:45.280
Oh, hey baby, let me show you the very fine things that I hide, yeah

02:17:45.280 --> 02:17:50.280
And I will take my love in the dark

02:17:50.280 --> 02:18:18.280
Easier to dance to than that freaking catch-up song, Orange Lounge Radio.

02:18:18.280 --> 02:18:24.040
Hi, we're back with more Orange Lounge Radio.

02:18:24.040 --> 02:18:28.000
That was an okay song, that good cool, except you could totally tell that that was a key

02:18:28.000 --> 02:18:33.640
sound rip from the game because like the singing's out, then, a bit off, while the person was

02:18:33.640 --> 02:18:34.640
trying to sing.

02:18:34.640 --> 02:18:36.960
That's pretty bad.

02:18:36.960 --> 02:18:39.680
First Resolution was the name of that song.

02:18:39.680 --> 02:18:43.660
100% Mini Moog was the one that sounded like 60 Radio Shack keyboard demos all going over

02:18:43.660 --> 02:18:44.660
each other.

02:18:44.660 --> 02:18:48.060
And Akira Yomoka, Empty of the Sky, which I kind of like that song, I dig that.

02:18:48.060 --> 02:18:52.200
And we're a Kira Yomoka horse here, so we have to play all of his new songs every day.

02:18:52.200 --> 02:18:55.780
And then 12th Style, of course, starting that set off, which Loki didn't like.

02:18:55.780 --> 02:18:56.780
He just wanted to share that with you guys.

02:18:56.780 --> 02:18:59.460
He didn't like that one.

02:18:59.460 --> 02:19:05.620
Skyline's open because I know we had at least one more personal one to get in, so call in.

02:19:05.620 --> 02:19:09.980
During the break there, it was being suggested, and now they're telling me to talk about this,

02:19:09.980 --> 02:19:15.340
it was being suggested that if Konami were to continue DDR, they should put out, which

02:19:15.340 --> 02:19:18.700
We really hope they do in the arcades, but they should put out DDR ABBA mix

02:19:19.620 --> 02:19:24.840
Which would be nothing but ABBA songs, but it can be canceled the smop mix smop

02:19:24.980 --> 02:19:27.900
It's a basically the Japanese version of medudo

02:19:28.920 --> 02:19:33.600
Really? Yeah, there was it was in the works a few years ago, and they axed it

02:19:33.600 --> 02:19:37.260
You know what was funny is that what you heard all that news about live eight, right?

02:19:38.420 --> 02:19:40.420
I tried to ignore all of it well

02:19:40.620 --> 02:19:44.220
Dreams come true played the Japanese live eight and that just made me laugh for some reason

02:19:44.220 --> 02:19:47.360
I don't know. I was like, oh, dreams come true. They're still around. Who knew?

02:19:47.360 --> 02:19:52.760
Hi, you're on Orange Honors Radio. Hey Sky, Siggy here. Hello, Siggy. Oh, it's my pronunciation hero.

02:19:52.760 --> 02:19:53.880
What's new with you?

02:19:53.880 --> 02:19:57.400
Well, I'm just gonna... First of all,

02:19:57.400 --> 02:20:00.800
Sky, it's not Daisuki. It's Daisuke.

02:20:00.800 --> 02:20:05.160
I like Daisuke. Actually, it's not a ke. It is a key.

02:20:05.160 --> 02:20:12.160
It's ke. Daisuke. There is not a ke sound in a key spelling.

02:20:12.160 --> 02:20:20.600
a key spelling. Hello, it's Japanese. I know, and the I ones are all E, A, I, U, A, O, Mami,

02:20:20.600 --> 02:20:29.760
Mumei, Mo, Tachi, Tuteto, right? Naruhodo. I think he just cursed you out in Japanese

02:20:29.760 --> 02:20:33.200
anyway. So what's on your mind? What would you call in to talk to us about tonight? Well,

02:20:33.200 --> 02:20:37.440
I just want to say, you know, I just want to pronounce the songs on Happy Sky Daughter

02:20:37.440 --> 02:20:44.160
in Japanese. Sounds good. What songs are these that you want to share with us? The artist's

02:20:44.160 --> 02:20:53.560
name is Chona Chiharu and the song title is Rakuen, which means paradise. And then, well,

02:20:53.560 --> 02:21:00.600
this one's not really Japanese, but it's a very hard pronunciation, very foreign one,

02:21:00.600 --> 02:21:06.000
which is the Akira Yamaoka song is Tompi Portois. Right, which is kind of more French than anything

02:21:06.000 --> 02:21:12.480
else yeah and thanks to sakurina she corrected me on the on what it means it means too bad for you

02:21:13.760 --> 02:21:17.440
too bad for you this is a little bit of that fun there we played that a little earlier in the show

02:21:17.440 --> 02:21:24.320
okay and then there's uh by uh tomasuke uh the song title is uh tizona del sid

02:21:24.320 --> 02:21:27.520
okay we have a little bit of we have a little bit of that one here too okay

02:21:30.240 --> 02:21:35.760
it's a little cheesy come on down and play 2dx happy sky all this can be yours if you put in a

02:21:35.760 --> 02:21:41.760
And then there's Captivate Joka.

02:21:41.760 --> 02:21:45.760
Okay. We have a little piece of that song. Hold on.

02:21:48.760 --> 02:21:52.760
Which is the remix of the 2DX Red ending.

02:21:52.760 --> 02:21:57.760
Oh, okay. I thought that sounded a little bit familiar when I first heard it. I was like, where have I heard this before? Okay.

02:21:57.760 --> 02:22:04.760
And then there's the one by Hoshino Kanako is Gekko, which means Moonlight.

02:22:04.760 --> 02:22:09.760
Which... I don't... Who did that one?

02:22:09.760 --> 02:22:12.760
I believe it was by Hoshi no Kanako.

02:22:12.760 --> 02:22:14.760
I don't know if I have that one handy.

02:22:14.760 --> 02:22:17.760
Okay, so there's that one.

02:22:17.760 --> 02:22:20.760
Yeah, and then the E-Amusement songs.

02:22:20.760 --> 02:22:23.760
Oh, I don't even know if I have those. Yeah?

02:22:23.760 --> 02:22:25.760
Agnus Dei by Asaki.

02:22:25.760 --> 02:22:28.760
Oh, okay, I do have that one. So I do have some of these E-Amuse songs. Goodie.

02:22:28.760 --> 02:22:43.760
Speaking of, speaking of Azaki, the Guitar Freaks Romania artist Azaki is currently working on an album, his very first project album.

02:22:43.760 --> 02:22:44.760
Oh really?

02:22:44.760 --> 02:22:47.760
Yeah, which is scheduled to be released September 16th.

02:22:47.760 --> 02:22:55.760
God, those Momani artists are just rolling out the albums now, seems like a new month, every month, somebody from like pop music or Guitar Freaks or somebody's putting out an album.

02:22:55.760 --> 02:23:00.760
In fact, that reminds me, I've got to mention the Akira Yomoka songs that have been announced, but anyway.

02:23:00.760 --> 02:23:02.760
We'll get to that in a little bit.

02:23:02.760 --> 02:23:09.760
Also, Good Cool. Good Cool is also making a Greatest Hits album.

02:23:09.760 --> 02:23:13.760
Didn't that just come out, or am I confusing it with another Good Cool album?

02:23:13.760 --> 02:23:17.760
Like, there was a Good Cool album that just came out this month, I think.

02:23:17.760 --> 02:23:20.760
Yeah, I think that's on Konami style.

02:23:20.760 --> 02:23:27.760
And let me mention the new, uh, the new Anothers on the, uh, 7 key.

02:23:27.760 --> 02:23:28.760
Ooh, what's that?

02:23:28.760 --> 02:23:29.760
Double 12s.

02:23:29.760 --> 02:23:30.760
I haven't been following that.

02:23:30.760 --> 02:23:31.760
Ooh, double 12s.

02:23:31.760 --> 02:23:32.760
Okay, what's that?

02:23:32.760 --> 02:23:33.760
Yeah.

02:23:33.760 --> 02:23:35.760
I'll just mention all of them in order.

02:23:35.760 --> 02:23:36.760
Okay.

02:23:36.760 --> 02:23:44.760
It's, uh, Ace, Double Ace, Blox, Colors Radio Edit, Fake Time, Gigadelic, Innocent Walls,

02:23:44.760 --> 02:23:57.760
Moon Child, One More Lovely, 108, Piano Kyousoku Kyokudai Chiba Sasoribi, or Piano Concerto Antiades, or Scorpion Fire, Please Don't Go, Sakura...

02:23:57.760 --> 02:24:00.760
Really? Please Don't Go is a new one, isn't it?

02:24:00.760 --> 02:24:02.760
Please Don't Go is actually from H-Style.

02:24:02.760 --> 02:24:03.760
Well, no, no, no, I know it's from H-Style.

02:24:03.760 --> 02:24:04.760
That was the athletics one.

02:24:04.760 --> 02:24:06.760
But did it have an another in it?

02:24:06.760 --> 02:24:07.760
No.

02:24:07.760 --> 02:24:09.760
Oh, I don't remember it having an another.

02:24:09.760 --> 02:24:11.760
It could have had another since H-Style.

02:24:11.760 --> 02:24:13.760
Really? I guess I was too scared of it.

02:24:13.760 --> 02:24:23.760
Sakura, Sentegeka, Spika, Stoick, which is my first level 12 that I've beaten, and lastly, V.

02:24:23.760 --> 02:24:30.760
Wow. You know, and all of those songs are hard enough on seven key that putting them on another is just crazy.

02:24:30.760 --> 02:24:37.760
Except maybe, like, Please Don't Go, I think it's kind of like a, you know, it's a less scary seven star than some of those other ones, but wow, that's pretty crazy.

02:24:37.760 --> 02:24:41.760
And this is for the level 12 doubles, and I'm going to mention.

02:24:41.760 --> 02:24:49.760
First Samurai, Ace, Double Ace, Blox, Cheer Train, Dixie, or DXY.

02:24:50.760 --> 02:24:52.760
Dixie? I've never heard it pronounced DIXY.

02:24:52.760 --> 02:24:54.760
It's acutally pronounced DIXIE.

02:24:55.760 --> 02:24:59.760
Oh my god, but if I were to call it DIXY, I'd think,

02:24:59.760 --> 02:25:05.100
I'd think doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo. Which is so not the song!

02:25:06.240 --> 02:25:10.320
I can't call it Dixie, I can't, I'm sorry! That's gonna have to stay in Japan.

02:25:10.320 --> 02:25:12.580
It doesn't matter, it doesn't matter. Alright, alright fine.

02:25:12.580 --> 02:25:29.540
And then era step mix. Big time, G2, Garden, Genocide, Ghost Revival, Hollock, Inazuma, Innocent Walls, Jam, Kakumei, Karma, Lesson5, Logic Board, Love Is Eternity, Lowerworld,

02:25:29.540 --> 02:25:35.860
Minimalian, Nemesis, Number 13, One More Lovely, Piano Kiyosaki Ryudai Chiba Sasoribi,

02:25:35.860 --> 02:25:38.020
Excuse me, I'm just kidding.

02:25:39.300 --> 02:25:47.540
Wristlim Remix, Sakura, Setsugekka, Sig Sig, Sphere, Spyka, Star Mine, Stoic, and Zephyr.

02:25:48.260 --> 02:25:52.580
That's a shitload of flashing 12s on Double, but you know Double's some scary shit. Do you play

02:25:52.580 --> 02:25:58.820
Doubles at all? I have never played a Doubles. I'm trying to play a normal when I have another

02:25:58.820 --> 02:26:03.220
controller i'm waiting for it for the u.s release yeah exactly you know what that's why i've been

02:26:03.220 --> 02:26:09.300
kind of holding off on playing the uh 2dx um at home lately is because i'm holding off because

02:26:09.300 --> 02:26:13.060
my controller sucks balls and um i'm looking forward to being able to get cheap controllers

02:26:13.060 --> 02:26:18.260
here because i'm thinking what the controllers here are going to cost what maybe $39.95 maybe

02:26:18.260 --> 02:26:23.700
i don't know don't quote me on this you think more i can get confirmation uh very soon on that

02:26:23.700 --> 02:26:27.780
really you've got some hookup i don't know about well that's because they send priceless to

02:26:27.780 --> 02:26:29.780
There's a GameStop before they put the stuff out.

02:26:29.780 --> 02:26:30.780
Find that show.

02:26:30.780 --> 02:26:31.780
The pre-orders.

02:26:31.780 --> 02:26:32.780
I want to know.

02:26:32.780 --> 02:26:33.780
I want to know.

02:26:33.780 --> 02:26:34.780
Really?

02:26:34.780 --> 02:26:35.780
More than 40 bucks for the controller?

02:26:35.780 --> 02:26:36.780
I would think so.

02:26:36.780 --> 02:26:37.780
I would, logically, I would think so.

02:26:37.780 --> 02:26:38.780
I hope not.

02:26:38.780 --> 02:26:40.420
You know somebody, some other company is going to put out a cheap one though, but of course

02:26:40.420 --> 02:26:43.780
you have to go with a regular Konami one because the other ones are going to suck, da da da.

02:26:43.780 --> 02:26:47.100
You know, you wait right, wait a second, I'll get the prices of them off of Konami style.

02:26:47.100 --> 02:26:50.260
You know, there were rumors going around that they were going to improve the controller

02:26:50.260 --> 02:26:51.260
when they released it here.

02:26:51.260 --> 02:26:53.140
I don't know if that's still true, but that would be nice.

02:26:53.140 --> 02:26:55.500
It's going to cost a significant amount, I'll put it that way.

02:26:55.500 --> 02:26:56.500
Oh, damn.

02:26:56.500 --> 02:26:59.500
Sorry about that, Siggy. We just had to have that little discussion.

02:26:59.500 --> 02:27:02.500
Have you heard anything about the 2DX controllers being released over here?

02:27:02.500 --> 02:27:04.500
No, not so far.

02:27:04.500 --> 02:27:07.500
Because I can tell you at E3 they just had the Japanese ones.

02:27:07.500 --> 02:27:11.500
I looked. I wanted to see if it was different, but it was just the regular Japanese ones.

02:27:11.500 --> 02:27:13.500
Yeah, I saw.

02:27:13.500 --> 02:27:19.500
And from what I've heard on the Japanese forums and message boards,

02:27:19.500 --> 02:27:22.500
Eden is the continuation of the video doll.

02:27:22.500 --> 02:27:24.500
That's what somebody was saying in the chatroom earlier.

02:27:24.500 --> 02:27:28.540
that was you or somebody else I've heard about that and a lot of the anime fanboys especially

02:27:28.540 --> 02:27:33.280
really like the doll videos. That's good. One of my favorite parts of 2DX is the videos

02:27:33.280 --> 02:27:37.980
so I really like hearing when they do, when they put work into the videos. But I haven't

02:27:37.980 --> 02:27:43.940
watched a lot of the 12 style ones. Or Happy Sky, I hate calling it Happy Sky. I haven't

02:27:43.940 --> 02:27:49.000
watched a lot of those videos so I will have to do that sometime. I just read something

02:27:49.000 --> 02:27:52.000
I think this is a goalie art book.

02:27:52.000 --> 02:27:53.000
Oh, I heard about this.

02:27:53.000 --> 02:27:54.000
From Konami style.

02:27:54.000 --> 02:27:55.000
Yeah, that's good.

02:27:55.000 --> 02:27:57.000
It's not bringing up any images right now.

02:27:57.000 --> 02:27:59.000
Isn't that going to be a great coffee table book to have?

02:27:59.000 --> 02:28:03.000
Yeah, it'll have to go with my DDR second mixed step book.

02:28:03.000 --> 02:28:04.000
Anyway.

02:28:04.000 --> 02:28:06.000
Alright, anything else on your mind today, Siggy?

02:28:06.000 --> 02:28:07.000
One more thing.

02:28:07.000 --> 02:28:08.000
Okay.

02:28:08.000 --> 02:28:13.000
The videos for e-amusement sounds like Agnus Dei and...

02:28:13.000 --> 02:28:14.000
Pink Rose and stuff?

02:28:14.000 --> 02:28:19.000
Nobody. They were actually recycled from Guitar Fix Romania.

02:28:19.000 --> 02:28:24.000
Oh. Oh, so the Guitar Fix, okay. That's kind of cool.

02:28:24.000 --> 02:28:31.000
And then there's, and then Pinkrose, I saw the video, and it's like a modified version from the keyboard media.

02:28:31.000 --> 02:28:33.000
That's kind of cool.

02:28:33.000 --> 02:28:38.000
Oh, that's kind of neat. Well, I mean, it's okay for them to recycle stuff if, you know, it's good stuff to deal with.

02:28:38.000 --> 02:28:42.000
And then for Votum Stelarum, it's an original.

02:28:42.000 --> 02:28:43.000
Oh, cool.

02:28:43.000 --> 02:29:09.000
And then they, whatchamacallit, they gathered all the videos from DJ Taka, like they mixed them all in one, and then the last part, they just featured the video for V where Tran is walking down the spiral staircase, that's the last part for Vodzum Stelarum, the video.

02:29:09.000 --> 02:29:13.560
huh okay well i could see that that kind of fits

02:29:13.560 --> 02:29:17.060
pretty cool all will will be i'm i'm hoping that a happy sky machine shows up

02:29:17.060 --> 02:29:20.620
nearby at some point in by nearby i mean if i have to go to so cal to play it

02:29:20.620 --> 02:29:21.480

02:29:21.480 --> 02:29:25.020
uh... so i can check this out causes i don't want you know i cannot wait to

02:29:25.020 --> 02:29:29.120
get read really but we will but we won't be able to see the amusement songs

02:29:29.120 --> 02:29:31.020
unfortunately

02:29:31.020 --> 02:29:36.200
oh yeah cuz you know that whole hookup is missing here i know kind of stuff

02:29:36.200 --> 02:29:37.040
alright

02:29:37.040 --> 02:29:38.560
well thanks for the call city

02:29:38.560 --> 02:29:43.400
All right. Always appreciate it as always. You stay on top of the 2DX stuff more than we do, so we appreciate it.

02:29:43.400 --> 02:29:45.320
Yeah. All right, take care, bud.

02:29:45.320 --> 02:29:47.320
All right, later. Later.

02:29:47.320 --> 02:29:50.800
Our buddy Siggy there from Vegas calling in to talk about

02:29:50.800 --> 02:29:53.520
2DX.

02:29:53.520 --> 02:29:59.400
And of course the chat room is yelling, what about ToeJam? What about ToeJam?

02:29:59.400 --> 02:30:03.560
Of course ToeJam being a transplant song from Ultramix 2, which was

02:30:03.560 --> 02:30:07.480
kind of one of the weird ones there. ToeJam is also an EMU song.

02:30:07.480 --> 02:30:12.360
Yeah, I know that. I know that's what I meant. Hello. That's alright.

02:30:12.360 --> 02:30:16.720
Okay, anyway, I think it's about time to get into the FUs of the week. This is the part

02:30:16.720 --> 02:30:21.880
of the show where we get, we get downright angsty. Because we're mad. We're upset. Grr.

02:30:21.880 --> 02:30:26.120
So, uh, Dark Sakura, why is it that we do, by the way, if you guys have your own FUs,

02:30:26.120 --> 02:30:29.480
you can send them in right now, but Dark Sakura, why is it that we do these FUs of the week

02:30:29.480 --> 02:30:30.480
every single week?

02:30:30.480 --> 02:30:47.080
My first nephew goes toward having to sit at Family Functions with a bunch of people

02:30:47.080 --> 02:30:56.760
I don't know, with many people in there, in the more wealthy part of the area.

02:30:56.760 --> 02:31:01.240
You know what? I don't want to be wealthy. I would rather be comfortable and happy and

02:31:01.240 --> 02:31:05.480
be a real person, you know. I mean, they're nice and everything. Don't get me wrong. They're

02:31:05.480 --> 02:31:11.260
nice. They're great people. I just don't think that I could stand having to keep up illusions

02:31:11.260 --> 02:31:16.080
all the time. You know, if I had a bunch of money, I don't think I would act like it.

02:31:16.080 --> 02:31:21.280
Another F.E. goes to just how hot it is in here. Man, no offense, but I'm sweating in

02:31:21.280 --> 02:31:22.280
here.

02:31:22.280 --> 02:31:26.780
That's the one downside to living in Sacramento, is that it's just huge, hot...

02:31:26.780 --> 02:31:28.080
I mean, just in here.

02:31:28.080 --> 02:31:32.280
I know, I know, but we got the air conditioner going, but we're doing the best we can.

02:31:32.280 --> 02:31:39.780
Eh, um, another F.U. goes towards my horrid digestion problems.

02:31:39.780 --> 02:31:41.780
That's it, I'm done.

02:31:41.780 --> 02:31:43.280
Oh yeah, this book is...

02:31:43.280 --> 02:31:45.280
You know, F.U. to my fiancé!

02:31:45.280 --> 02:31:47.780
Freakin' finishing a book before me!

02:31:47.780 --> 02:31:49.280
Butthead, I told you to wait.

02:31:49.280 --> 02:31:50.780
Dang, that was quick.

02:31:50.780 --> 02:31:55.780
I know. Well, I would have read it this fast. I've just had other, you know, real-life things to do.

02:31:55.780 --> 02:31:57.780
All right.

02:31:57.780 --> 02:32:00.780
I'm reading it right now.

02:32:00.780 --> 02:32:04.780
All right, yeah. Good participation tonight, by the way.

02:32:04.780 --> 02:32:05.780
Oh, I'm participating.

02:32:05.780 --> 02:32:06.780
Yes, you are.

02:32:06.780 --> 02:32:08.780
And reading. I am talented.

02:32:08.780 --> 02:32:09.780
You're multitasking.

02:32:09.780 --> 02:32:10.780
Yeah, multitasking.

02:32:10.780 --> 02:32:11.780
Like a Mac.

02:32:11.780 --> 02:32:14.780
Like a Mac. Except I'm a lot cooler.

02:32:14.780 --> 02:32:17.780
All right, let's get to Loki's FUs of the Week then.

02:32:17.780 --> 02:32:22.840
uh...

02:32:22.840 --> 02:32:24.380
at first like you

02:32:24.380 --> 02:32:28.260
this goes to a long-running subject that i've been talking about before

02:32:28.260 --> 02:32:32.100
that is the lack of driving skill in the female uh...

02:32:32.100 --> 02:32:36.540
population and i'm a good driver

02:32:36.540 --> 02:32:40.980
before you start saying that listen okay i said most of the population let you

02:32:40.980 --> 02:32:44.200
want to you know make noise and put yourself as part of that

02:32:44.200 --> 02:32:46.740
you know percentage that no

02:32:46.740 --> 02:32:50.780
is especially appalling because, you know, I'm always wondering why the problem isn't

02:32:50.780 --> 02:32:55.740
solved around here. Well, today, on my way over to the studio, there was a cop that pulled

02:32:55.740 --> 02:32:59.780
out in front of me. First blew through the red light like nothing, and I'm talking about

02:32:59.780 --> 02:33:03.360
not stopping under red to make a right hand turn, just, you know, completely blowing through

02:33:03.360 --> 02:33:09.320
cutting me off, which is fine, it's a cop, you know. Then she proceeds to get into the

02:33:09.320 --> 02:33:16.320
right turn lane, to which then she goes straight cutting me off again. Then she goes and makes

02:33:16.320 --> 02:33:21.120
in another right hand turn without stopping at all at the stop sign and flips a bitch

02:33:21.120 --> 02:33:24.960
right there in the middle of the street and guess what she's on her fucking cell phone

02:33:24.960 --> 02:33:31.440
a goddamn cop fuck you sacramento pd and your stupid female cop that was driving down you

02:33:31.440 --> 02:33:36.140
know the road here i mean god damn it you guys are supposed to set an example of what's

02:33:36.140 --> 02:33:41.640
right and here she's violating all the traffic laws going i'm talking on my cell phone you

02:33:41.640 --> 02:33:45.360
know the hell with you people no wire problems not getting solved i'm going to talk to my

02:33:45.360 --> 02:33:50.360
my congressman, god damn it, and get that stupid cell phone law passed, then we'll work

02:33:50.360 --> 02:33:56.720
on the female driving issue. Um, wow. Fuck you to the fact that my air conditioning is

02:33:56.720 --> 02:34:01.720
not working in our apartment. For some reason, I think there's a leak in the Freon hose because

02:34:01.720 --> 02:34:06.240
they filled it up about a month ago, and now they're done. So that would lead me to believe

02:34:06.240 --> 02:34:10.320
that either there's some Freon fairy that's stealing the Freon in the middle of the night,

02:34:10.320 --> 02:34:13.080
Or there might be a hole in the hose, okay?

02:34:13.080 --> 02:34:17.860
So, well, that sucks, and luckily for me, though, I have to babysit the dog.

02:34:17.860 --> 02:34:21.940
Which brings me to my next step for you, because that stupid dog wants to wake me up three

02:34:21.940 --> 02:34:25.360
times during the night because it's used to a routine.

02:34:25.360 --> 02:34:29.860
That routine being to wake me up three times during the night and piss me off.

02:34:29.860 --> 02:34:35.140
I fucking hate that dog, and I gotta do this for a week.

02:34:35.140 --> 02:34:41.180
And then finally, fuck you to the people that made the stupid Hanzo the Razor movie because

02:34:41.180 --> 02:34:46.100
no samurai movie should be about some guy that mutilates his penis to then have sex

02:34:46.100 --> 02:34:48.600
with women to interrogate them.

02:34:48.600 --> 02:34:51.580
That's not a samurai movie, that's a porno movie.

02:34:51.580 --> 02:34:54.400
Don't get too confused.

02:34:54.400 --> 02:34:55.400
That's all.

02:34:55.400 --> 02:35:09.680
I want to give an FU to the fact that I'm total retard in general.

02:35:09.680 --> 02:35:15.840
No, but when it comes to hooking up the new Xbox to the new HDTV, because I use the Xbox

02:35:15.840 --> 02:35:19.400
as a DVD player, because believe it or not, the Xbox actually makes a pretty decent DVD

02:35:19.400 --> 02:35:23.320
player, but I cannot for the life of me figure out how to get component and get the really

02:35:23.320 --> 02:35:27.720
pretty HD picture via the Xbox, and I went to Gamestop and they didn't know, and I went

02:35:27.720 --> 02:35:30.600
to Radio Shack and they didn't know, and I went to Target, and, well, shit, they're never

02:35:30.600 --> 02:35:31.600
any help.

02:35:31.600 --> 02:35:32.960
To buy the component cables.

02:35:32.960 --> 02:35:33.960
Okay.

02:35:33.960 --> 02:35:36.720
Neither of these stores, none of these stores have them for the Xbox, and I'm starting to

02:35:36.720 --> 02:35:38.560
wonder if they even exist, so I have to do research online later.

02:35:38.560 --> 02:35:39.560
They do.

02:35:39.560 --> 02:35:40.920
Somebody in the chat room needs to help me out.

02:35:40.920 --> 02:35:41.920
Got Best Buy.

02:35:41.920 --> 02:35:45.200
Yeah, I'm thinking Best Buy might have them, so I'll check that out a little later.

02:35:45.200 --> 02:35:48.080
Anyway, so a nephew to that, um, a nephew to Impulse Buying, because I...

02:35:48.080 --> 02:35:49.920
I can't believe they don't have them at Gamestop.

02:35:49.920 --> 02:35:50.920
I've seen them there.

02:35:50.920 --> 02:35:53.220
Well, they didn't have it at this one, so F.U. did this GameStop.

02:35:53.220 --> 02:35:57.220
And an F.U. to impulse buying, because I just bought a multi-hundred dollar TV today.

02:35:57.220 --> 02:36:00.620
But that's alright. I deserved it.

02:36:00.620 --> 02:36:04.120
I was a good boy this year, and I deserved a good present.

02:36:04.120 --> 02:36:07.620
It's kind of a late birthday present to myself, really.

02:36:07.620 --> 02:36:09.520
And, um...

02:36:09.520 --> 02:36:11.320
Gosh, I think that's really it. Just an F...

02:36:11.320 --> 02:36:13.220
Oh, oh, oh.

02:36:13.220 --> 02:36:18.920
F.U. to the impending nurses strike at UC Davis, because it's going to postpone my dad's surgery again.

02:36:18.920 --> 02:36:20.220
Again, for the second time.

02:36:20.220 --> 02:36:26.220
And I realize, you know, nurses, you know, they need their rights and everything too, so just F you to the timing of the whole thing.

02:36:26.220 --> 02:36:27.220
Yeah.

02:36:27.220 --> 02:36:28.220
Just screwing it all up.

02:36:28.220 --> 02:36:30.220
Especially those male nurses.

02:36:32.220 --> 02:36:33.220
Stop it.

02:36:35.220 --> 02:36:36.220
Alright.

02:36:36.220 --> 02:36:38.220
Let's get to the chatroom F yous, shall we?

02:36:40.220 --> 02:36:41.220
Let's see.

02:36:42.220 --> 02:36:49.220
Rini would like to give an F you to my PlayStation 2 for screwing up my speedruns in Katamari Damacy.

02:36:49.220 --> 02:36:52.740
because the analog feature kept dying on my brand new controller.

02:36:52.740 --> 02:36:57.500
Sakurazian? I don't know, Sakura S1N?

02:36:57.500 --> 02:37:01.740
I'm thinking it's Sakurazian or something. F you to my nephew for being a retard and

02:37:01.740 --> 02:37:03.100
just being a stupid dumbass.

02:37:03.100 --> 02:37:08.780
Misty would like to say, fuck the person that broke the subwoofer caging

02:37:08.780 --> 02:37:11.700
on the In the Groove 2 dedicated cabinet at teatime.

02:37:11.700 --> 02:37:15.300
If I ever find out who it was and I actually meet them, there's gonna be hell to pay.

02:37:15.300 --> 02:37:18.300
Especially if it's somewhere that's not one of my arcades.

02:37:18.300 --> 02:37:22.060
I hope they decide to keep the machine, and one goes to Loki because as I typed this out

02:37:22.060 --> 02:37:24.800
I was thinking he's probably going to laugh or something when he hears this.

02:37:24.800 --> 02:37:28.300
He actually just ran to the bathroom, so he got away with it.

02:37:28.300 --> 02:37:32.720
Misty says, also I want to pass this one along from a friend that doesn't have IRC.

02:37:32.720 --> 02:37:35.500
Fuck all the Harry Potter spoilers.

02:37:35.500 --> 02:37:37.740
Double amen to that, although I've been lucky.

02:37:37.740 --> 02:37:43.860
Sakurina is a guy, says F you to myself for eating too much tonight and suffering a stomach

02:37:43.860 --> 02:37:49.020
aid, a stomach ache, and F you to the heat here, especially since we celebrated Christmas

02:37:49.020 --> 02:37:58.100
today early. That's kind of early. Let's see, Jammer J would like to send an F you to roof

02:37:58.100 --> 02:38:04.060
repairs after hurricanes. Ouch, sorry to hear about that. Reznor says an insane fuck you

to Sony for making it so damn hard to become a Jedi in Star Wars Galaxies, and fuck you

02:38:08.860 --> 02:38:13.460

02:38:13.460 --> 02:38:19.300
joystick that doesn't work worth anything I'm so sorry if I fuck up this

02:38:19.300 --> 02:38:25.700

give an F.U. to Max. Ronchan would like to say F.U. to my family for being dipshits all

02:38:47.100 --> 02:38:50.980
you die already. F.U. to my friend Carmen for only showing up in the city every six

02:38:50.980 --> 02:38:55.780
months and hanging out with her causing me to miss most of Orange Lounge Radio. Visit

02:38:55.780 --> 02:39:02.660
more woman! Is that Carmen Sandiego? No, I don't think it is. Vidpower would like to

02:39:02.660 --> 02:39:08.600
say an F.U. to Lint. I agree. Lint is annoying. Where does Lint come from? That's what I want

02:39:08.600 --> 02:39:14.600
know I never really sure bothered to read on it but where you know it wasn't

02:39:14.600 --> 02:39:17.440
on the shirt when I bought it you notice how your shirts become a little bit

02:39:17.440 --> 02:39:22.280
dandy start seeing through them that's a pewter whoever can't design a shirt

02:39:22.280 --> 02:39:27.880
right last up dark Tetsuya says F you to whatever is causing the voices to be

02:39:27.880 --> 02:39:35.800
really quiet on Fox so guess what maybe it's time to stop I ran I ran into like

02:39:35.800 --> 02:39:42.360
watched part of Family Guy. God damn you! God damn you! And they were talking about

02:39:42.360 --> 02:39:47.760
Peter is fascinated with the world of never ending the story and he was riding Falcor

02:39:47.760 --> 02:39:53.120
and he was too heavy so Falcor crashed into the ground. That's hilarious. Will you stop

02:39:53.120 --> 02:39:57.720
giving free plugs to the competition? I love that show! Family Guy is our competition now,

02:39:57.720 --> 02:40:04.600
you must hate it. I watch every episode on repeat on the internet. On BitTorrent, yeah.

02:40:04.600 --> 02:40:10.600
That's fine. It's TiVo. I call it TiVo.

02:40:10.600 --> 02:40:13.600
Alright. We're going to go to a quick break. Just a couple songs.

02:40:13.600 --> 02:40:16.600
So we're going to come back and we're going to do some Ask Orange Lounge.

02:40:16.600 --> 02:40:18.600
You guys, it's your guys' chance to control the show.

02:40:18.600 --> 02:40:20.600
And I notice we have a lot of new listeners tonight.

02:40:20.600 --> 02:40:22.600
And I'm wondering if that's coming from the podcast or what.

02:40:22.600 --> 02:40:26.600
But it's your chance to ask us any question you want, within reason.

02:40:26.600 --> 02:40:30.600
Keep it clean. Speaking of which, go to podcastawards.com.

02:40:30.600 --> 02:40:32.600
You'll notice at the bottom of the page to the right,

02:40:32.600 --> 02:40:36.720
to the right, you'll see the best video game podcast. And, whoa, look in there, it's Orange

02:40:36.720 --> 02:40:41.260
Andrea's A Go. Vote with every single email address that you have. Actually, you can do

02:40:41.260 --> 02:40:45.460
it every day. You know what? Be careful, because I don't want us to get disqualified. So, if

02:40:45.460 --> 02:40:49.300
you just remember to vote every day, just use one email address is enough. Honestly,

02:40:49.300 --> 02:40:54.860
it really is. You don't have to worry about the multiple. Is that okay? Just get all of

02:40:54.860 --> 02:40:57.940
your friends to vote, too. Yeah, that's it. You don't have to use multiple. You just get

02:40:57.940 --> 02:40:58.940
And aunts and uncles.

02:40:58.940 --> 02:40:59.940
And their IP addresses.

02:40:59.940 --> 02:41:00.940
That's the thing.

02:41:00.940 --> 02:41:01.940
That's the key.

02:41:01.940 --> 02:41:02.940
Oh, it's fine.

02:41:02.940 --> 02:41:03.940
Alright.

02:41:03.940 --> 02:41:11.140
Also, you should check out our podcast anyway, in general, because it's really cool.

02:41:11.140 --> 02:41:14.460
And you can subscribe on iTunes and it's so easy.

02:41:14.460 --> 02:41:19.700
All you have to do is do a search for orange lounge and we show up.

02:41:19.700 --> 02:41:20.700
Imagine that.

02:41:20.700 --> 02:41:21.700
So listen to us.

02:41:21.700 --> 02:41:24.700
For me, I was just holding him and just in front of my cat.

02:41:24.700 --> 02:41:25.700
What?

02:41:25.700 --> 02:41:26.700
Dark Sakura?

02:41:26.700 --> 02:41:27.700
I didn't hear that.

02:41:27.700 --> 02:41:32.060
If you do a search for Dark Sakura, all one word, on Google Images, the third picture

02:41:32.060 --> 02:41:33.700
you come up with is my cat.

02:41:33.700 --> 02:41:37.500
Do they get any pictures of you?

02:41:37.500 --> 02:41:39.420
Because I think our listeners are curious what you look like.

02:41:39.420 --> 02:41:42.940
They've been wanting to see your picture for forever.

02:41:42.940 --> 02:41:47.980
All they have to do is pull up iTunes and look at our little picture there.

02:41:47.980 --> 02:41:53.800
You can see a little teeny tiny, or not even 50 by 50, teeny tiny picture.

02:41:53.800 --> 02:42:00.800
When I get back from, um, my, uh, special break, I will post a picture in the chat room.

02:42:00.800 --> 02:42:01.800
Yay!

02:42:01.800 --> 02:42:02.800
Alright.

02:42:02.800 --> 02:42:04.800
Isn't that really cute?

02:42:04.800 --> 02:42:05.800
Alright, we'll be back.

02:42:05.800 --> 02:42:08.160
Uh, we're gonna, uh, play a song.

02:42:08.160 --> 02:42:11.440
I feel like, I wanna hear something from Red, since we've been playing Happy Sky all night,

02:42:11.440 --> 02:42:12.440
I wanna hear some Red.

02:42:12.440 --> 02:42:13.440
So we're gonna get to K-KAK!

02:42:13.440 --> 02:42:14.440
K-Kak.

02:42:14.440 --> 02:42:21.440
We'll be back after this.

02:44:21.440 --> 02:44:23.440
Hey!

02:47:21.440 --> 02:47:40.640
It's just a disturbed guide!

02:47:40.640 --> 02:47:42.640
Just a disturbed guide.

02:48:10.640 --> 02:48:28.640
Please listen to Orange Lounge Radio, because Real Radio makes Captain Jack cry.

02:48:28.640 --> 02:48:32.480
We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio and it's time to get into some Ask Orange Lounge,

02:48:32.480 --> 02:48:34.040
but first actually what I wanted to state.

02:48:34.040 --> 02:48:37.600
This is a response to something that was said in the chat room like an hour ago, but I forgot

02:48:37.600 --> 02:48:38.600
to respond to it.

02:48:38.600 --> 02:48:42.960
somebody was mentioning a magical drop 3 tournament and I was like oh my god

02:48:42.960 --> 02:48:46.240
magical drop is like one of my favorite puzzle games ever like it's right up

02:48:46.240 --> 02:48:50.680
there with like medios you know I have that on Neo Geo CD I have magical drop

02:48:50.680 --> 02:48:54.840
on my cell phone how hardcore is that give me give me some credit I love

02:48:54.840 --> 02:48:58.560
magical drop anyway I just want to say that too much metal for one hand let's

02:48:58.560 --> 02:49:03.120
get into so oh by the way in that break we had a Kakak from 2d x red everyday

02:49:03.120 --> 02:49:09.600
lovely day my favorite consumer song I love that song and Dixie no I'm sorry I

02:49:09.600 --> 02:49:13.120
can't do it without laughing DX y all in that break but I knew if we didn't get

02:49:13.120 --> 02:49:19.240
in some some taku that our one and only dark soccer would be very upset so yeah

02:49:19.240 --> 02:49:22.840
I would have screamed bloody murder and murdered everybody we have a freaking

02:49:22.840 --> 02:49:30.000
ton of questions tonight ask orange lounge you ready for this

02:49:30.000 --> 02:49:37.000
Let's ask Orange Lounge some stupid question. What will we find out this week on Orange Lounge Radio?

02:49:37.000 --> 02:49:43.000
I have to admit I'm a little bit scared because there's new people listening tonight and who knows what they might submit.

02:49:43.000 --> 02:49:45.000
It might be questions we've heard a thousand times.

02:49:47.000 --> 02:49:49.000
It's a different song every time.

02:49:49.000 --> 02:49:51.000
We need to make one long compilation of all this.

02:49:51.000 --> 02:49:54.000
I am officially halfway through the book.

02:49:54.000 --> 02:49:59.000
I like that it has purple text on black on the spine.

02:49:59.000 --> 02:50:05.000
Rini is asking about, could you elaborate more on Togo's presence at E3?

02:50:05.000 --> 02:50:08.000
It's the first time hearing about him being there.

02:50:08.000 --> 02:50:11.000
Yeah, Togo was there. I don't know why he was there.

02:50:11.000 --> 02:50:14.000
I imagine, I think it has something to do with Mania being in the U.S.

02:50:14.000 --> 02:50:16.000
I think he might be a part of that.

02:50:16.000 --> 02:50:17.000
Please don't quote me on that.

02:50:17.000 --> 02:50:20.000
I think I had heard something about that he's kind of a part of that.

02:50:20.000 --> 02:50:23.880
kind of a part of that, which makes sense because he's been kind of heavy in the Japanese

02:50:23.880 --> 02:50:27.720
consumer style side. But I did get my picture with him, so when I finally stopped being

02:50:27.720 --> 02:50:30.720
lazy and put up my picture gallery, which maybe I'll do tonight if I can tear myself

02:50:30.720 --> 02:50:36.760
away from my new HDTV. He was there, Sana was not, Akira Yamoko was not there this year,

02:50:36.760 --> 02:50:41.200
which made me a little sad, so Togo was kind of the token Bamani artist that was there.

02:50:41.200 --> 02:50:48.520
But he wasn't doing any type of talks or anything like that, so that's all we know. He was there

02:50:48.520 --> 02:50:51.540
and meeting people, and wasn't scared of us when we ran up and asked for a picture. Me

02:50:51.540 --> 02:50:56.600
and Miklata ran up and were like, let's get a picture.

02:50:56.600 --> 02:51:02.280
Let's see, moving on, we have a question from Reznor. Reznor wants to know, is there a live

02:51:02.280 --> 02:51:07.540
show dedicated to other video games or old school gaming? We actually do have one other

02:51:07.540 --> 02:51:14.340
live show currently on the network, and that is on Tuesday nights, Dark Sakura, and you

02:51:14.340 --> 02:51:17.700
do talk about the old school gaming sometimes. Yeah, sometimes I even play stuff from them.

02:51:17.700 --> 02:51:19.700
So what would you say is the theme of your show?

02:51:19.700 --> 02:51:21.700
Theme? I have a theme.

02:51:21.700 --> 02:51:24.700
Exactly. The theme is Jamie. That is the theme.

02:51:24.700 --> 02:51:31.700
It's whatever the heck I feel like playing and whatever anybody requests as long as it's not a seeming piece of fecal matter.

02:51:31.700 --> 02:51:40.700
Um, Reznor, I must also say that, um, uh, we're gonna be launching a retro lunch program here on the station very soon.

02:51:40.700 --> 02:51:43.700
We're gonna play the greatest in 8 and 16-bit music.

02:51:43.700 --> 02:51:44.860
all the 8-bit music done.

02:51:44.860 --> 02:51:46.660
I just need to get the 16-bit music done, and then we're

02:51:46.660 --> 02:51:47.420
ready to go.

02:51:47.420 --> 02:51:50.740
So all right.

02:51:50.740 --> 02:51:52.500
Moving on.

02:51:52.500 --> 02:51:53.380
Let's see.

02:51:53.380 --> 02:51:56.440
Gameboyguy13 wanted a clarification on that site

02:51:56.440 --> 02:51:58.260
where we could vote.

02:51:58.260 --> 02:52:01.300
That was podcastawards.com.

02:52:01.300 --> 02:52:03.180
Although also, if you want to be so kind,

02:52:03.180 --> 02:52:07.260
podcastalle.com has a voting system, A-L-L-E-Y.com.

02:52:07.260 --> 02:52:09.580
And the more people that vote for us there, just do a search

02:52:09.580 --> 02:52:11.540
for Orange Lounge, the higher ranked we are and the more

02:52:11.540 --> 02:52:12.220
attention we get.

02:52:12.220 --> 02:52:15.860
And again, we here at Orange Launch Radio, we like attention.

02:52:18.780 --> 02:52:19.260
Let's see.

02:52:19.260 --> 02:52:22.620
Sacarino wants to know, what do you think the next 2DX style

02:52:22.620 --> 02:52:24.220
will be called?

02:52:24.220 --> 02:52:27.060
Since there is Happy Sky, 2DX Red,

02:52:27.060 --> 02:52:29.100
what do you think the next one will be called?

02:52:31.940 --> 02:52:33.060
2DX 13.

02:52:36.940 --> 02:52:40.100
Just 13.

02:52:40.100 --> 02:52:47.580
Alright. Um, let's see. DarklionXVI, also known as Siggy, just wanted to point out that

02:52:47.580 --> 02:52:52.420
I mispronounced c-c-c-ck, because I just like saying it that way. It's actually c-c-chack.

02:52:52.420 --> 02:53:02.140
Sorry. Jammer Jay wants to know. Oh, I'm sorry. That was a request. My bad. Not a question.

02:53:02.140 --> 02:53:09.500
Whoops. Oh, Sacra Sacrasian, I think that is, wants to know, why do you think there

02:53:09.500 --> 02:53:13.340
hasn't been ABBA in DDR yet and why do I have to wait for a picture of Dark

02:53:13.340 --> 02:53:17.440
Sakura oh shoot I was gonna do that right I was reading Harry Potter the

02:53:17.440 --> 02:53:22.240
weight will be very short here it comes and why hasn't there been ABBA in DDR

02:53:22.240 --> 02:53:28.220
yet you know lay all your love on me a cover of that was on dance mania x5 so

02:53:28.220 --> 02:53:31.120
that song would have been else and erotic house cover dancing Queen that's

02:53:31.120 --> 02:53:35.600
true erotic actually had a whole album of ABBA covers that was pretty good so

02:53:35.600 --> 02:53:39.080
lay all your love on me would have been eligible for like DDR fourth mix but for

02:53:39.080 --> 02:53:48.080
some reason, it was overlooked. It's Sakura S1N, my bad. Alright, so you'll get your picture

02:53:48.080 --> 02:53:55.440
of Dark Sakura very shortly. And that's it, that's all the questions we've gotten so far.

02:53:55.440 --> 02:54:01.600
So I guess that's it for Ask Orange Lounge. I guess so. We're reading some other things

02:54:01.600 --> 02:54:14.200
in the chatroom there. Let's see. 2DX Violet is a suggestion there. 2DX X2. And then they're

02:54:14.200 --> 02:54:18.760
back to talking about Harry Potter, so go figure. I just, I couldn't get into the Harry

02:54:18.760 --> 02:54:26.140
Potter books. I have RDD. I have Reading Deficit Disorder. I can't read the big books. I don't

02:54:26.140 --> 02:54:30.260
know why. I try. I used to, but the weird thing is I used to when I was a kid all the

02:54:30.260 --> 02:54:37.260
I used to read Judy Blume, I used to read R.L. Stine, the Ramona Quimby books, come on, those things were the shit.

02:54:37.260 --> 02:54:39.260
Don't roll your eyes at me!

02:54:39.260 --> 02:54:42.260
I can roll my eyes at whoever I want to!

02:54:42.260 --> 02:54:44.260
Ramona was the shit.

02:54:44.260 --> 02:54:46.260
I read the Tales of a Fourth Grade Nothing.

02:54:46.260 --> 02:54:48.260
See? He read the Judy Blume too.

02:54:48.260 --> 02:54:50.260
I left in super fudge.

02:54:50.260 --> 02:55:00.520
Reznor wants to know, what is your favorite magical drop 3 character?

02:55:00.520 --> 02:55:03.720
You know, actually most of the magical drop I played was number 2, I didn't really play

02:55:03.720 --> 02:55:04.720
number 3.

02:55:04.720 --> 02:55:08.120
I didn't know there was an emulator for number 3 yet, so I haven't really played much of

02:55:08.120 --> 02:55:09.440
3, just 2.

02:55:09.440 --> 02:55:16.520
So I don't really know the characters that well, I'm sorry, I just play it.

02:55:16.520 --> 02:55:20.120
And Rini wants to know, pancakes or waffles?

02:55:20.120 --> 02:55:21.120
Waffles.

02:55:21.120 --> 02:55:22.120
Waffles.

02:55:22.120 --> 02:55:23.120
Neither.

02:55:23.120 --> 02:55:24.120
Belgium waffles.

02:55:24.120 --> 02:55:26.520
Waffle house waffles.

02:55:26.520 --> 02:55:30.360
The peanut butter and banana waffle from the country, or was that country waffles?

02:55:30.360 --> 02:55:31.360
Not waffle house.

02:55:31.360 --> 02:55:32.360
We don't have those here.

02:55:32.360 --> 02:55:33.360
Country waffles.

02:55:33.360 --> 02:55:34.360
Yeah.

02:55:34.360 --> 02:55:37.120
The banana and peanut butter are the bomb.

02:55:37.120 --> 02:55:38.120
Love it.

02:55:38.120 --> 02:55:39.120
Alright.

02:55:39.120 --> 02:55:44.120
Anyway, that's going to do it for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

02:55:44.120 --> 02:55:51.120
Thank you for listening and tuning in to us and listening to our show and our rants and our raves.

02:55:51.120 --> 02:55:54.120
Now it's time to go around and get everybody's final thought.

02:55:54.120 --> 02:55:56.120
Loki, your final thought tonight?

02:55:56.120 --> 02:56:00.120
My final thought is this week's going to suck.

02:56:00.120 --> 02:56:02.120
Why?

02:56:02.120 --> 02:56:06.120
Because that baby's a damn dog, and the dog's going to wake me up every night at four in the morning,

02:56:06.120 --> 02:56:09.120
4 in the morning and I'm not going to be getting that much sleep.

02:56:09.120 --> 02:56:11.120
I'm sorry to hear it and so that sucks.

02:56:11.120 --> 02:56:14.120
Plus I don't get to be at my house where I have internet.

02:56:14.120 --> 02:56:18.120
So my mom has dial-up and that's no good.

02:56:18.120 --> 02:56:20.120
DarkSakura, your final thought.

02:56:20.120 --> 02:56:27.120
Reject false icons and people stop getting in my way of me reading the book.

02:56:27.120 --> 02:56:31.120
And my final thought is I'm going to go play with my new television.

02:56:31.120 --> 02:56:33.120
I want to go play Xbox really big.

02:56:33.120 --> 02:56:34.120
Can't wait.

02:56:34.120 --> 02:56:36.120
2DX. I'm so playing 2DX tonight.

02:56:36.120 --> 02:56:38.120
I played Guitar Man on mine.

02:56:38.120 --> 02:56:40.120
Ooh, how was that?

02:56:40.120 --> 02:56:42.120
50 inches of Guitar Man goodness.

02:56:42.120 --> 02:56:44.120
I actually have a widescreen TV.

02:56:44.120 --> 02:56:47.120
You have to set your PlayStation options to the widescreen.

02:56:47.120 --> 02:56:49.120
I won't forget.

02:56:49.120 --> 02:56:51.120
Because it'll look kind of funky if you just do it on the TV.

02:56:51.120 --> 02:56:53.120
No, but I'm going to play 2DX widescreen and I'm going to...

02:56:53.120 --> 02:56:57.120
I'm going to probably spill beer in my pants.

02:56:57.120 --> 02:57:00.120
You can also do Ultramix in widescreen.

02:57:00.120 --> 02:57:02.120
I don't think Ultramix supports HD. That made me sad.

02:57:02.120 --> 02:57:04.120
Yeah. I looked on the back. It doesn't support HTC.

02:57:04.120 --> 02:57:12.120
But the thing is, is that for the PS2, you have an option in your menu to change the graphic option.

02:57:12.120 --> 02:57:14.120
Can't wait. Can't wait.

02:57:14.120 --> 02:57:20.120
All right. Final word of the show. One word to sum the whole damn thing up for everybody.

02:57:20.120 --> 02:57:24.120
Happy episode 150, you guys, by the way.

02:57:24.120 --> 02:57:25.120
Congratulations.

02:57:25.120 --> 02:57:26.120
Yay.

02:57:26.120 --> 02:57:28.120
I think this should be the last one. Let's finish. We're done.

02:57:28.120 --> 02:57:29.120
Bye.

02:57:29.120 --> 02:57:34.120
No, we'll be back next week with episode 151, and then we're going on vacation for a little while.

02:57:34.120 --> 02:57:41.120
At least I am, so I think that means we all are, unless one of you guys is going to be doing a show for your house, I don't know. We'll see. We'll talk about that later.

02:57:41.120 --> 02:57:46.120
Maybe we should do, like, a countdown episode.

02:57:46.120 --> 02:57:48.120
Countdown episode? Can we just get out of here?

02:57:48.120 --> 02:57:49.120
I'll work on it.

02:57:49.120 --> 02:57:52.120
Five, four, three, uh-uh-uh.

02:57:52.120 --> 02:57:55.120
Twenty-nine! Twenty-eight!

02:57:55.120 --> 02:58:02.440
How about when the doors close, you just say, GO!

02:58:02.440 --> 02:58:09.380
The chat room wants me to remind you all of Channel Oregon Trail, a brand new station.

02:58:09.380 --> 02:58:13.460
Maybe we should start Oregon Trail Radio, what do you think?

02:58:13.460 --> 02:58:15.320
And now, the dysentery song.

02:58:15.320 --> 02:58:19.000
Alright, join the Oregon Trail Channel, it owns your soul.

02:58:19.000 --> 02:58:20.760
And that's it.

02:58:20.760 --> 02:58:22.200
Final word of the show.

02:58:22.200 --> 02:58:27.200
Loki, one word to sum it all up, TV spot soon.

02:58:27.200 --> 02:58:33.200
That does it for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio Live.

02:58:33.200 --> 02:58:38.200
Orange Lounge Radio Live is an Orange Lounge Radio production.

02:58:38.200 --> 02:58:46.200

02:58:46.200 --> 02:58:51.200
And now, here is your fortune cookie message of the day.

02:59:16.200 --> 02:59:30.840
Thank you very much for listening, and we'll see you next week.

02:59:46.200 --> 03:00:05.720
All right, off to go tape our podcast where we won't talk about Bimani, much to the disappointment

03:00:05.720 --> 03:00:09.040
of Rini, who asked me earlier this evening why we don't talk about Bimani on our podcast.

03:00:09.040 --> 03:00:13.040
We do once in a while, but we just try to be a little different on the vodcast.

03:00:13.040 --> 03:00:15.840
We talk about games that don't suck, and some that do.

03:00:15.840 --> 03:00:19.340
So we're off to go do that, and we'll see you guys later.

03:00:19.340 --> 03:00:23.400
But for right now, you guys are getting booted from the stream, because we're going back

03:00:23.400 --> 03:00:24.840
to our Bahmani Music and More program.

03:00:24.840 --> 03:00:28.200
So reconnect to the stream in about 15 seconds or so and...
